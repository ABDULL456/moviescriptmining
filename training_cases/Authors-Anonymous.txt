FADE IN: 
1   EXT. FITZGERALD/GRAHAM APARTMENT -- HOLLYWOOD - DAY 
North Hayworth Avenue, off Sunset Boulevard. A quiet, tree- lined residential street. Note the small apartment complex set back from the curb. 
CAPTION: HOLLYWOOD, CALIFORNIA 
Our narrator is HENRY OBERT (O-BURT)(30). 
HENRY (V.O.) This is where where F. Scott Fitzgerald died on December 21, 1940. 
INSERT ARCHIVAL PHOTOS of Fitzgerald.   His work.   His life. 
HENRY (V.O.) (CONT'D) Fitzgerald was one of the truly great American writers of the 20th century. Tender is the Night. The Last Tycoon. This Side of Paradise. And, of course, my favorite, The Great Gatsby. But Fitzgerald ended up out here. Writing movies that never got made. Drinking too much. Alienating people. Losing his way. 
2   EXT.   FITZGERALD/GRAHAM APARTMENT -- SIDEWALK - DAY 
Henry stands on the sidewalk. Full of promise and hope. Wears a pizza delivery outfit as he stares at the apartment, more with reverence than curiosity. 
CAPTION: HENRY OBERT 
HENRY (V.O.) I stop by here sometimes--out of respect. Fitzgerald had this amazing gift. 
3   EXT. FITZGERALD/GRAHAM APARTMENT -- SIDEWALK - CONTINUOUS 
Henry crosses the street--heading for his parked Honda.     He unlocks the car. Swings open the back door. 
HENRY (V.O.) But he wasted it. He wasted his talent. 
Henry yanks a MAGNETIC SIGN out of the back seat and slaps it on the outside of the driver's door: PIZZA STARZ. One last glance at the fabled apartment complex. 
HENRY (V.O.) (CONT'D) When I sell my novel, I won't make his mistakes. 
4   INT. ALAN AND COLETTE'S HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM - DAY 
The man (40's) and woman (30's) sit on the couch in their tastefully-decorated San Fernando Valley home. Expensive taste in clothes. Her cleavage a bit too obvious. Both seem a little uncomfortable. Uncertain. 
CAPTION: DR. ALAN & COLETTE MOONEY 
They look off to the side, speaking to someone off-camera. 
ALAN We thought this was going to be a reality series. 
COLETTE You know, like the Kardashians. 
They listen.    Here comes the bad news. 
ALAN Oh. Really? A documentary? This is going to be a documentary about our writing group? 
COLETTE The whole group. Not just us, right? Not that it should be just about us... 
Nervous laugh. 
ALAN No. 
They look at each other: A documentary? They try to mask their disappointment. 
COLETTE So this is going to be like--like what I saw the other night on cable? About bees mating. 
ALAN Or that, um, that one about the Holocaust. 
Colette nods, remembering. 
HENRY (V.O.) Our writing group meets every Tuesday night. Mostly at Alan and Colette's. Sometimes we rotate. 
John helps himself to some shrimp.   Then helps himself to some more. 
HENRY (V.O.) (CONT'D) I love coming to the group. Everyone always has such constructive feedback. It's like we're all in this together. 
HANNAH I really like the way Yuri is developing, Colette. 
COLETTE You do? 
JOHN Well, if you ask John K. Butzin... 
Can't help looking at the camera. Making sure it's on him. 
JOHN (CONT'D) You're still going to have to explain why this Natasha dame goes AWOL on her husband. Still kinda iffy to me. 
Another glance at the camera: Did you get that? 
ALAN I was bothered by that, too. Why would Natasha betray a reliable, dependable husband for a washed-up young punk? 
All eyes on Colette.    She shifts in her chair.   Uncomfortable. 
COLETTE Oh.   Well...um...um... 
An uneasy silence. Colette is blocked--nowhere to go creatively. Her face tightens up. Bites her lip. 
COLETTE (CONT'D) Oh God. I've been rewriting and rewriting and rewriting and-- 
ALAN Poodles.     It's OK. 
COLETTE No. It's not OK. I still can't explain Natasha's motive. What's the use? I'm not a writer. 
William to the rescue. 
WILLIAM Whoa. Whoa. Time out. The dude's good in bed. Trust me, that's all the motive she needs. 
JOHN Roger that. Torpedo Chapter Three. Blow it up. Get the focus back on this broad--Natasha. 
HENRY --Yes. I was thinking the same thing. 
HANNAH Make it clear that Natasha wants to be closer... 
Colette makes notes furiously, nodding in agreement. 
HENRY (V.O.) Writing can be such a solitary existence, so it's good to have this outlet where you can meet other writers and exchange ideas. Here it really is all for one and one for all. 
11   INT. ALAN AND COLETTE'S HOUSE -- DINING ROOM - NIGHT               11 
Later that evening.    Meeting is over. 
Alan, Colette, Hannah, Henry, William, and John are all standing up now. William stretches. John reaches for more shrimp. Friendly banter. Laughter. 
COLETTE Who wants coffee? 
Everybody does.    William taps Henry on the shoulder. 
WILLIAM Lend me ten bucks? I'm having cash flow issues. 
HENRY Sure. 
WILLIAM Thanks, bro'. You're the best. 
12   INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - DAY                                       12 
Henry sits at his desk, staring at the blank computer. Lost in thought. Emphasis on lost. 
HENRY (V.O.) This new novel Pizza to Go is about Scott, a pizza delivery guy in LA. He comes across some interesting characters. I like what I have so far, but it's only a hundred pages and I'm stuck... 
13   INT.   HENRY'S APARTMENT - LATER - DAY                             13 
Henry stands in front of the mirror in his apartment, wearing the Pizza Starz hat and shirt. Ready for work. 
HENRY (V.O.) ...Haven't written a word in the last two weeks. Not one. Hannah teases me about having writer's block. 
14   INT. ALAN AND COLETTE'S HOUSE -- DINING ROOM - NIGHT               14 
ALAN William's right. We'll start. She'll show up. 
William starts passing out pages. Henry eyes the empty chair. Colette looks over William's pages. There are only three. She has a puzzled look. 
COLETTE William, aren't these the same pages you read last time? 
WILLIAM Nope, they're different. 
JOHN They look the same. 
WILLIAM They're different. I changed a word. 
HENRY One word? 
COLETTE That's it? 
WILLIAM Writing is rewriting, Colette. Bukowski said, "Write five words. Rewrite seven." 
HENRY No. Dorothy Parker said that. 
JOHN One word?    Jesus H. Christ. 
WILLIAM It's my creative vision, John. 
ALAN (Jumping in) Which we are here to support. This is William's decision. 
WILLIAM Let me just read. See if you can pick out the word. Tell me if it's better, or worse. 
JOHN (Muttering) One goddamn word. 
Henry continues staring at the empty chair. 
29   INT. RESTAURANT #1 - NIGHT                                      29 
The evening meeting is winding to an end. John stands up to stretch. Alan slides papers into his leather satchel. 
HANNAH'S CHAIR remains empty. Henry remains concerned. 
HENRY I wonder what happened to Hannah. 
ALAN It's not like her to miss. 
The mystery is quickly solved. Front door opens. In rushes Hannah, dashing directly towards the others, looking harried. 
HANNAH I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry for missing the meeting. 
JOHN What happened? Your car break down? 
ALAN You oversleep? 
COLETTE Maureen. Is Maureen OK? 
WILLIAM People. C'mon. Look at her. That glow. Hannah met a guy. She got laid. 
Hannah gives William a playful smack on the back. 
HANNAH As a matter of fact, I did meet a guy. 
WILLIAM Told ya. 
HANNAH His name's Brian. 
Check out Henry. He looks absolutely horrified. No! 
Hannah takes a deep breath and flashes a smile the size of the Grand Canyon. 
HANNAH (CONT'D) He's my new agent! 
She remembers the camera. 
HANNAH (CONT'D) (Directly to camera) An agent. I've got an agent! 
Surprise and silence. The writers look at each other and then back at Hannah. Not quite sure how to react. 
Stunned as Hannah turns her attention back to the group. 
Henry and Hannah arrive at her car. She unlocks the front door of her clunker-of-a-Ford as Henry waits. 
HENRY I'm so proud of you, Hannah. 
HANNAH Your turn will come, Henry. You're a better writer than I am. So much better. You went to college. 
Hannah looks directly into the camera, pointing to Henry. 
HANNAH (CONT'D) He's a great writer. Henry Obert. I knew him when. 
Henry, clearly embarrassed, puts his hand up to block the camera. Tries to change the subject. 
HENRY Listen. Maybe some afternoon we could go for a drive. There are some special places I'd like to show you. 
HANNAH Sure. I can't believe I've lived out here four years and haven't seen -- 
She stops in mid-sentence.   A light goes on in her head. 
HANNAH (CONT'D) Oh, my. 
HENRY What? 
HANNAH Four years. It's been four years since I moved here. And now I have an agent. It's the number four again. My lucky number. I should have known this was going to happen. 
HENRY There is no one more deserving. 
Hannah rewards Henry's praise with a peck on the lips.    And a warm hug. 
Hannah steps in her car, starts it up and rolls down the window. 
HANNAH I'm going to dedicate my novel to you. 
A final wave and Henry watches as she disappears into the night. He sighs. 
34   INT. MONTAGE OF SHOTS - DAY                                        34 
A series of shots featuring the writers writing--or, at least, trying: Alan pauses between eye appointments to record an idea. 
William continues scribbling at the restaurant, this time eyeing WAITRESS #2. 
Hannah, sitting cross-legged on her bed, types away on her laptop computer. 
Colette sits on her private bench, seeking inspiration. 
John sits at his keyboard. Vintage black-and-white war movie plays on the TV. John appears more interested in the movie. 
Henry stares at his laptop. The screen is blank. Henry surrenders yet again and flips off the computer. 
35   INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - DAY                                       35 
Henry, sitting in his studio apartment, wears his pizza delivery outfit. Ready for work. Talks to the camera. 
HENRY I'm happy for Hannah. (MORE) 
HENRY (CONT'D) Still, her getting an agent sort of ruins my plans, doesn't it? I mean, Hannah has an agent. I don't. That won't work for dating. I can't ask her out until I get an agent. 
Henry gestures at a PHOTOGRAPH taped to the wall among his rejection letters. 
HENRY (CONT'D) That's Richard Benedict. He's written seven novels. Fantastic writer. 
INSERT ARCHIVAL PHOTOS of Richard Benedict. 
HENRY (CONT'D) The Fitzgerald of his generation. Richard Benedict made me want to be a writer. 
36   INT. ALAN AND COLETTE'S HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM - DAY                 36 
Colette dressed in a leotard, practices basic yoga on a mat in her living room. Chanting. Overly dramatic, as always. 
Takes a break and talks to the camera. 
COLETTE My novel is called Nyet, Not Yet. It's about a Russian woman who comes to this country in search of love. It was inspired by a story I heard from one of my massage clients, Yuri. Yes, it's true--I used to do massage. In fact, that's how I met Alan, though I certainly didn't give him the kind of massage he really wanted. At least not the first time. 
Colette allows herself a slight smile at the memory. 
COLETTE (CONT'D) I will get an agent. It comes down to this: if Hannah can get an agent, I can get an agent. After all, I am a graduate of Mills College. 
HANNAH (To herself; counting on her fingers) Colette Mooney. C-o-l-e-t-t-e M-o-o- n-e... 
She can't finish the count. The ugly truth is staring her in the face. 
HANNAH (CONT'D) 13 letters.    Oh, dear... 
Hannah and Maureen exchange concerned looks. 
38   INT. ALAN'S OFFICE   DAY                                          38 
Hannah and Henry sit together in the reception area. Alan breezes in, ever-smiling, greeting both enthusiastically. 
39   INT. ALAN'S OFFICE - DAY                                          39 
Rows of EYE GLASSES on display as Alan guides Hannah over to the fitting table. Henry tags along. 
HANNAH Thanks for seeing me today, Alan. 
ALAN No problemo. Let's get you some new eye wear. 
HANNAH Something that makes me look smart. 
HENRY You're already smart, Hannah. 
Hannah gives Henry's hand a playful squeeze: Thank you. Alan and Hannah sit down opposite from each other. Henry pulls up a chair to the side. Alan selects a pair. Puts them on Hannah. 
ALAN How about... 
Hannah shrugs her blase reaction. 
HANNAH Mmmmmmm. 
Alan removes the brown-colored frames.   Studies them for a second. Then -- inspiration arrives. 
ALAN Excuse me.   One sec. 
He reaches inside his coat pocket for his RECORDER. Speaks into it. 
ALAN (CONT'D) Ah. Name for character. Alexander Brown. Wears brown-colored glasses. 
HANNAH Of course he would. 
Henry nods, agreeing. Satisfied, Alan puts the recorder away and reaches for another pair of glasses. 
ALAN You know this great idea for a novel hit me this morning. It's called Unleashed. 
Alan tries the second pair on Hannah. She checks herself in the mirror. Then she shows Henry. They both shake their head: No. It is a funny moment between friends. They laugh as Alan reaches for pair #3. 
ALAN (CONT'D) It's about a dog who becomes human for 24 hours in order to rescue his kidnapped owner. I love this idea, Hannah. 
HANNAH Could be a winner. 
Alan puts the third pair of glasses on Hannah. She checks herself in the mirror, finally liking what she sees. She looks over towards Henry. 
HANNAH (CONT'D) What do you think? 
Poor Henry. She does look good. He's falling even harder for her by the moment. 
HENRY You look great, Hannah. 
Hannah can't decide. She studies herself in the mirror as Henry studies her. Henry reaches for his ANDROID and snaps a photo of her. Alan brings them back to real time. 
ALAN Question: You think your agent might be interested in this idea? Does he have a dog? 
HANNAH (Evading) Oh. I don't know-- 
ALAN How about a cat? It could be a cat. 
HANNAH Um. Sure.   Probably could be. 
ALAN Think about mentioning it to your agent, OK? Unleashed. Dog -- or cat -- becomes human. 
Alan beams with pride at his imagination on display. Hannah fidgets. Avoids Alan. Henry jumps in to save the moment. 
HENRY I'll help you develop the idea, Alan. 
First we see the FRAMED PHOTO of a certain business mogul. 
SIGRID (CONT'D) Herr Trump.    Very rich. Very famous. Very sexy. 
Then we move on to the second PHOTO of a certain TV celebrity. 
SIGRID (CONT'D) Herr Simon Cowell. Very rich. Very famous. Very sexy. 
Move on to the third PHOTO.     Hey, we know this person: 
SIGRID (CONT'D) Ja. My special guy. Herr Bootzin. About to become very rich. Very famous. Already very sexy. (Beat) Then maybe Sigrid Hagenguth becomes Mrs. John K. Bootzin, ja? 
44   EXT.   COLETTE'S GARDEN - DAY                                      44 
Colette sits. Focused on the WHITE ENVELOPE in one hand. Alan sits next to her, squeezing her other hand. Photo of Oprah on the other side. 
COLETTE I know this is a rejection letter. I can't open this. I can't be rejected today. I take rejection so personally. 
ALAN I bet it's good news. 
She opens the envelope. Peeks inside. No letter. Just the SMALLEST POST-IT NOTE flutters out on to the ground. Colette picks it up. 
COLETTE "Sorry. Not interested." I knew it. How can such a big rejection come from such a small piece of paper? 
Colette folds the Post-It Note in half--and then in quarters. Holding it in her hand, she begins to chant. Alan holds on to her hand and pats her on the back. Good husband. 
45   INT. HANNAH'S APARTMENT - DAY                                      45 
Hannah and Maureen watch with interest and obvious appreciation as Henry, dutifully wearing his uniform, cleans their living room carpet. 
Open PIZZA STARZ ÍBOX on the breakfast bar. Looks like Henry has brought dinner, as well. Hannah's iPhone goes off. As a courtesy, Henry stops the machine. 
HANNAH (On phone) Hello? Yes. Oh, hi, Brian. (LISTENING) Really? (LISTENING) Oh my god! Oh my god! Oh my god! 
Hannah starts jumping up and down like a little girl while Maureen and Henry look on in bewildered anticipation. 
HANNAH (CONT'D) (On phone) Oh my god! 
MAUREEN What's he saying? 
HANNAH He sold my novel. 
HENRY What? 
HANNAH (Nodding excitedly) Brian sold Sleeping on the Moon! 
Now Maureen starts jumping up and down. Henry can't hide his surprise. 
MAUREEN Oh my god!   Oh my god! 
HANNAH (On telephone) Yes, Brian. I will. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I will. Promise. Thank you! 
Hannah turns off her iPhone. Mother and daughter can't believe the news. Jumping up and down. Warm embrace. 
In turn, they both embrace Henry, who also shares the genuine, sincere moment. 
HENRY You did it, Hannah!   You did it! 
MAUREEN I'm so proud of you, dear! 
HANNAH Thank you. 
Another embrace between mother and daughter.   This could go on all night. 
HENRY We need to tell the group! 
The smile disappears from Hannah's face. 
HANNAH The group. Oh, dear. The group. No, no, I can't tell them about this. 
HENRY Why not? 
HANNAH Oh. 
She looks to Maureen for support. 
Puzzled looks are the reaction. 
ALAN U.R. the Publisher? 
HENRY They self-publish. E-books. Print on Demand. 
JOHN That's right, Obert. But I'll have my book in two weeks. None of this B.S. waiting around. John K. Butzin will be a published author. And be published first. 
HANNAH (Ever-diplomatic) Well, John. Congratulations. 
She leans over and gives him the briefest of hugs. There are other congratulatory murmurs coming from the group. 
ALAN My, two published authors in the group. The rest of us are going to have to catch up. 
48   INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                  48 
The meeting gets down to business. Alan, Colette, Henry, William and Hannah, wearing her new glasses, listen as John reads from Roaring Lion. 
JOHN (Reading) Gunner stared out over the bleak horizon, seeing one dead Viet Cong after another lay scattered on the bloody hillside. He had won this time, but Gunner knew Charlie would be back in the morning. By god, he would be ready. So would his M60 General Purpose Machine Gun and Mark 2 Fragmentation/Hand Rifle Grenade. 
John finishes and sits back in his chair, quite pleased with himself. 
ALAN OK, John. Nicely done. Let's get some feedback. 
Henry, as always, has been making notes. 
HENRY Well.   In terms of the characters-- 
JOHN (Jumping in) --Hold on, Obert. I wanna hear from her. 
John points towards Hannah. 
ALAN We'll hear from everybody. 
JOHN I don't want to hear from everybody. She has a book coming out. John K. Butzin has a book coming out. I want to hear from Hannah, author to author. 
WILLIAM Oh, screw you. 
ALAN This is really going against the spirit of the group, John. Everyone's opinion is valid. 
JOHN Hers is more valid. What'd you think, Hannah? Tell me. 
Hannah struggles to speak. Clearly uncomfortable. 
HANNAH I-I . . . 
The words freeze in her mouth. Awkward silence. Finally. 
WILLIAM (Standing up) Going outside for a smoke. 
William thunders away from the group. Colette watches him go. 
COLETTE I'll go talk to him. 
Colette follows, calling after William. 
ALAN Let's take a fifteen minute break, shall we? 
Embarrassed, Hannah excuses herself. Henry trails along after her, leaving a muttering John and calm Alan alone. Alan reaches for his recorder. Talks into it. 
ALAN (CONT'D) Ahhh, idea for Michael Crichton-type novel. Members of Antarctic research station attacked by mutant penguins. 
Satisfied, Alan turns off the recorder while John reaches for more pizza. 
49   EXT. COLETTE'S GARDEN - DAY                                        49 
Colette is back on her bench. Standing behind her is a mysterious MAN (Over 40) who favors black clothes and dark shades. 
CAPTION: DR. XIROMAN 
COLETTE I want you to meet someone special. This is my spiritual adviser. Doctor Xiroman has taken a vow of silence for one full year to protest climate change. What an amazing man. Dr. Xiroman is going to cleanse the air of all this rejection. 
Camera goes to Dr. Xiroman. Somber, expressionless. Does he even have a pulse? 
Dr. Xiroman walks over to small fire pit and meditates as he places his hands over the rising flames. Colette begins a New Age chant for added support. 
53   INT. ALAN'S OFFICE - DAY                                           53 
The casually dressed MAN (40's) sits in the waiting area for Alan Mooney, spending time on his iPhone, conducting business as he waits. 
CAPTION: DAVID KELLER 
He doesn't have to wait long. Alan personally comes out into the waiting area to fetch him. Big grin. Hand extended. 
ALAN Dr. Alan Mooney. 
David, caught off guard by the doctor's sudden appearance, winds up his phone conversation. 
DAVID (on phone) Let me call you back. 
David stands up. 
DAVID (CONT'D) David Keller. 
They shake hands. 
ALAN I know. Big fan. Big fan. 
David can't help but notice the camera. 
ALAN (CONT'D) Oh, that. They're doing a little documentary about my writing group. 
DAVID Really? 
ALAN Just act natural. 
Lowering his voice. 
ALAN (CONT'D) It was supposed to be a reality series. 
54   INT. ALAN'S OFFICE -- EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY                       54 
Standard examination room. Alan guides David into the chair. 
ALAN Great. Let's start out with a basic eye examination. 
Alan flips a couple SWITCHES. Eye reading CHART appears on the wall. Alan turns off the lights. 
ALAN (CONT'D) OK, David. See if you can read that first line for me, please. 
DAVID (Reading) X7K6AC 
ALAN Very good, David. Would you like to try for what's behind Door Number Three? Try this one, please. 
Alan brings up a different line on the screen. 
DAVID (Reading) E2PH8S 
ALAN 20/25. Looking good, David. But anyone can identify simple letters and numbers. Let's see how you do reading a more challenging text. 
Alan brings up a different page. Several paragraphs on a printed page. 
ALAN (CONT'D) See that? 
DAVID Yes. 
ALAN Good. Read me the first paragraph, please. 
DAVID (Reading; monotone) Natasha, the Russian peasant, dressed oh-so-slowly, consumed totally, completely, absolutely, by endless thoughts of Yuri. 
ALAN Oh. Very nice. Very nice. Now the next paragraph, please. 
David looks rather puzzled, but complies. 
DAVID (Reading; monotone) "I never, ever thought I could feel this way," Natasha said excitedly. "Nor could I," Yuri said happily, his body dripping with enormous beads of sweat. 
ALAN Man. Wow. Gee. Isn't that great writing? My wife Colette wrote that. The patients just love reading her stuff. It's from her new novel, Nyet, Not Yet. 
A loud KNOCK on the examination room door. David is saved by the bell. 
ALAN (CONT'D) My, I wonder who that could be. 
HENRY Yeah. Sure wish I knew what was going to happen with them. 
Hannah gives Henry a friendly tap on the knee for encouragement. 
HANNAH You'll figure it out, Henry. It'll pass. Focus on your writing. No distractions. The writing comes first. 
Henry lets it sink in.   Changes the subject. 
HENRY Say, um, remember I offered to drive you around and show you a couple special places? 
58   EXT. RICHARD BENEDICT HOME - DAY                                   58 
The imposing house screams success.     Henry and Hannah sit in Henry's parked car, taking it in. 
HANNAH Who lives here? 
HENRY Richard Benedict. 
HANNAH Oh.   That writer you like? 
HENRY Like? No. It's much more than that. Wow. He...He... 
Henry struggles to put it into words. 
HENRY (CONT'D) ...Reading Richard Benedict...made me want to be a better writer. He's that good, Hannah. 
HANNAH Can't say I've read his stuff.     Nice house, though. 
59   EXT. FITZGERALD/GRAHAM HOME - DAY                                  59 
Henry and Hannah stand on the sidewalk in front of the North Hayworth home. Henry seems barely able to contain his excitement. 
HENRY Here we are. 
Hannah stares blankly at the house. 
HENRY (CONT'D) North Hayworth Avenue. Hollywood, California. 
Hannah smiles politely, but it's clear she doesn't recognize the house. 
HENRY (CONT'D) Big clue time. Sheila Graham. 
Still nothing registers with Hannah. 
HENRY (CONT'D) OK. Give up? Writer Sheila Graham lived here. Fitzgerald was her lover. This is where he died on December 
Hannah lets it all sink in. 
HANNAH Fitzgerald? He's the one who shot himself, right? 
HENRY No. Fitzgerald. F. Scott Fitzgerald. He wrote The Great Gatsby. 
The name doesn't register with Hannah. 
HENRY (CONT'D) (Reciting from heart) Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's-- 
HANNAH (Interjecting) I've never read it. 
Henry can't hide his surprise. 
HENRY What? 
Hannah stops, cognizant of the ever-present camera. 
HANNAH (To camera) Could you turn that off for a few minutes, please? 
HENRY You know they can't. What's wrong? 
Hannah hesitates.   Counts to three. Lowers her voice. 
HANNAH I've never read The Great Gatsby. 
HENRY You're kidding. 
HANNAH Henry. I never went to college. I've heard of Hemingway. A little. Fitzgerald. Somewhere. But I don't have your education. Your smarts. I haven't read all these great novels. My stories come from my heart. 
HENRY Definitely. 
62   EXT. HANNAH'S APARTMENT / CITY STREET - DAY                       62 
Parked on the street in front of Hannah's apartment. Henry and Hannah, this mutual admiration society, stand by the car. Hannah still has her copy of Gatsby. Short beat. 
HANNAH What a dear, sweet friend you are. 
Hannah graces Henry with another hug. Another quick peck on the lips. But wait--Henry wants more. He kisses her back. More than a peck. Too much more. Hannah, surprised, pulls back--her hand on his chest: Stop. 
HANNAH (CONT'D) (Gently) No distractions. The writing comes first, 'kay? 
Henry nods reluctantly: Understood. One last hug from Hannah before she heads for her front door, smiling back over her shoulder at Henry. Henry watches her leave, knowing that this was absolutely, positively, the best day of his life. 
63   INT. HANNAH'S APARTMENT -- LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                    63 
The writing group meets. Hannah, Henry, John, William, Alan and Colette sit around the living room, pages in front of them. 
WRITERS AT WORK sign on display. 
Maureen, trying not to be in the way, goes from writer to writer, carrying a large TRAY OF VEGGIES. 
ALAN Alright.   Whose turn is it to read? Henry? 
All eyes on Henry. He shifts uncomfortably in his chair. 
HENRY Oh. Um. Someone else go. I don't have anything new ready tonight. 
Concerned looks all around. 
COLETTE It's been weeks, Henry. 
HENRY I know.   Still can't focus. 
JOHN Don't be a pussy, Obert. Get writing. Complete the mission. 
HANNAH Writer's block can be very serious, John. 
John scoffs in disbelief. Maureen offers William some veggies. He helps himself and checks out Maureen as she moves on to Alan. 
WILLIAM What's so hard, bro'? I mean, you've got Scott and Christy. Two friends. Tell their story. 
HENRY That's the problem. I think the story's changing. 
ALAN Changing?   How so? 
HENRY Lately I'm feeling something much deeper, much richer. Scott and Christy, um, growing closer. 
The other group members appear puzzled. 
COLETTE Christy's a beautiful, wealthy author in Beverly Hills. How close can they get? 
HENRY Follow me. Something happens. Christy has an epiphany. She-She realizes her feelings run much deeper now for Scott. 
Henry does everything he can not to look at Hannah. Short beat. 
WILLIAM Nah.    Don't buy it. 
JOHN They're friends. Why muck it up? Don't put 'em in the same foxhole. 
COLETTE Is this Scott wanting to go beyond the friendship? There's no way Christy would suggest it. What do you think, Hannah? 
ALAN Yes. Hannah, what do you think? 
All eyes go back to Hannah.     She does not want to answer. 
HANNAH Gee, I-I guess...I really never thought of them that way. 
HENRY Never? 
Hannah shakes her head.   Chooses her words carefully. 
HANNAH No. It's always been a friendship. 
Henry takes a moment.   Thinking. 
68   INT. JOHN'S MOBILE HOME - NIGHT                                     68 
Full meeting of the writing group, all crammed around the dining table. Henry and Hannah sit apart. 
A single BOWL OF PRETZELS has been placed before them. Hannah reads from her typed pages. Alan, William, Colette, and Henry hang on her every word. 
John is half-listening at best, more interested in the MAGAZINE he's thumbing through. 
William REACHES UNDER THE TABLE and gently squeezes Colette's hand. Surprised, she pulls her hand away. 
HANNAH (Reading; with feeling) "Please come home, Michael." "Why would you want to marry me, Kyra? I barely graduated high school." "Michael, I don't care about some silly college degree. You're the most intelligent person I've ever known. You are my shining star." 
Then Colette puts it back and squeezes William's hand. It's his turn to be surprised. 
Hannah slides off her new reading glasses, waiting for someone to react. The room falls silent. Alan steps in. 
ALAN OK.   Comments. Anyone? 
No response. Group members look at the pages.      At each other. No one steps forward. 
HANNAH I value your feedback.    We're all in this together, right? 
Nobody bites. 
HANNAH (CONT'D) Colette--Did the new scene work for you? 
Colette seems thrown by the direct question. 
COLETTE Oh...Gee...Hannah. What? I mean, you're being published. This is being published. 
HANNAH But my editor wants rewrites.      Am I on track? 
Colette punts.   Alan jumps in to save his wife. 
ALAN Of course you are, Hannah. 
WILLIAM You got the deal. You got the check. First one to be published. 
John CLEARS HIS THROAT rather loudly: What about me, butthead? William ignores him. 
ALAN I think what I'm hearing from the group is...is...you're fine. We all love it. Nothing here to critique. You don't need us--well, it's not that you don't need us, but, you know... 
Alan's voice trails off before he can dig himself any deeper. More silence as Hannah wrestles with this unexpected reaction. Finally looks to Henry for help. 
HANNAH What do you think, Henry? 
All eyes on Henry. He hesitates.   Then -- 
HENRY Yes. Actually, it is really good, but there are a couple things--little things--I'd point out. For example-- 
JOHN Holy Douglas MacArthur -- 
All eyes on John. Finally holds up magazine to reveal that he's been reading VARIETY. 
JOHN (CONT'D) (Reading) "Hollywood decides to go sleeping on the moon. (MORE) 
JOHN (CONT'D) First-time scribe Hannah Rinaldi, repped by Brian Barkley of SoHo, scores six-figure movie deal. Ink is still fresh, but Barkley boasts keen interest by..." 
John keeps reading. Various reactions, mostly muted, around the table. Can Hannah's face turn any redder? 
69   INT. MONTAGE OF SHOTS - NIGHT                                      69 
Members of the writing group struggle to deal with Hannah's latest success: 
Alan and Colette sit on their living room couch together, wearing matching pajamas, staring straight ahead like zombies. His tape recorder sits on the coffee table. Alan reaches for it. She grabs it from his hand and throws it. 
William sits at the counter of Restaurant #2, drumming his fingers on the legal pad, half-heartedly trying to write. WAITRESS #3 pours him some more coffee, trying to make eye contact with him. William ignores her. 
John sits in front of his computer screen, but he can't concentrate. Gives up. Shuts down computer. Flips on TV. Another war movie. 
Henry stares absent-mindedly at his wall of rejection letters. 
Hannah sits at her computer--the only one actually working at the moment--but she stops long enough to take a deep, deep sigh. A lot weighs on her mind. 
70   EXT. ALAN AND COLETTE'S HOUSE -- DRIVEWAY - DAY                    70 
WILLIAM (CONT'D) Hannah. Hannah. Hannah. We could have been so hot together. I'm just as good a writer as you are, but you sure look better in a skirt -- 
HENRY (Voice rising) That's enough. 
WILLIAM I don't need any of you. I don't need any of your pointless, pedestrian feedback. I'm a writer. 
JOHN You've got goddamn three pages. 
WILLIAM They're a great three pages! You just don't appreciate my dedication. 
HANNAH You're a pretend writer, William. 
Silence.   William is surprised that Hannah speaks out. 
HENRY She's right. You act the part. You like the lifestyle. You hit on women. You quote Bukowski. But Bukowski did the work. Each and every day he wrote. That's your problem, William. You don't do the work. 
WILLIAM I don't do the work? Man, that sounds frickin' hilarious coming from you. When's the last time you wrote anything? 
That hits a nerve. William and Henry stare each other down. Enough. William flips off the group with his middle finger. Mumbling, grumbling under his breath, he starts to leave. Pauses at the WRITERS AT WORK sign. Picks it up. 
ALAN Not the sign! 
Too late. William RIPS it in two. And a second time for good measure. Throwing the pieces on the ground. Stomps out of the house, slamming the front door. 
The group turns quiet for a long beat. Everyone calming down. 
Alan takes control again -- eyes still darting over to what's left of his beloved sign. 
ALAN (CONT'D) Let's move on. Next item. Richard Benedict is going to be doing a signing at Wordsmith next week. 
Alan looks directly at Henry. 
ALAN (CONT'D) Who wants to go? 
86   INT. BOOKSTORE - DAY                                              86 
Large bookstore. Long line. Why? Because Richard Benedict is in the building, doing a signing of his new novel The Pineapple Man. 
Hannah, Henry, Alan, and Colette stand in line together, waiting. Colette is holding one copy of the BOOK. Hannah has one. Henry has one. 
Alan reaches inside his coat pocket for his RECORDER. Snaps it on. 
ALAN Idea for novel. Jealous husband murders his tramp-of-a-wife and buries her chopped-up body in the back yard. 
Colette pretends not to hear. Line inches forward. Alan cranes his neck to see what's happening. 
HENRY (To himself) Mr. Benedict, I just want to thank you. No. You've inspired my writing-- No. Hi. I'm Henry. I just think you're the greatest... 
Colette puts a friendly hand on Henry's shoulder. 
COLETTE Let me tell you something, Henry. 
Henry looks to her, expecting words of comfort. 
COLETTE (CONT'D) One day, I'll have a signing like this. 
Colette looks around, already imagining the event. 
87   INT. JOHN'S MOBILE HOME - DAY                                    87 
John is bent over his PRINTER, jiggling the front end, trying to open it. Tapping it on the side. No luck. 
JOHN Nope. Not going to see Richard whatever-his-name-is. John K. Butzin, author, doesn't need to stand in line anymore. No, sir. This soon- to-be best-selling writer is spending every minute, every dollar, on promoting Roaring Lion. 
Try as he might, John can't open up his printer. Sigrid appears. Leans in. Effortlessly opens up the printer. Takes the cartridge from John. Snaps it in. Shuts the lid. Done. John grunts his thanks. 
JOHN (CONT'D) Strudel, check my sales ranking again. 
Sigrid steps to the computer and taps a couple keys. Stares at the screen. 
SIGRID (Reading out loud) 
Not quite the hoped-for response. Turns quiet inside the mobile home. John clears his throat. 
JOHN Wow. Look how far I've moved up already. 
The young MALE ASSISTANT behind the counter, obviously paid to be patient, points to the framed sign on the counter, in large letters: NO UNSOLICITED MANUSCRIPTS WILL BE ACCEPTED. 
Colette and Dr. Xiroman will not be deterred. She holds a thick MANILA ENVELOPE. 
COLETTE I have to see Ms. Piper. We just need five minutes. 1-2-3-4-5 minutes of her time. 
The assistant points back to the sign. 
COLETTE (CONT'D) Can you just please stick your head in her office, tell her that Colette Mooney is here. I know she's busy, but she'll certainly want to see my manuscript. 
The assistant ignores her. 
COLETTE (CONT'D) (Flustered) I'm a graduate of Mills College. 
Behind them, coming from the inner office, we hear LOIS PIPER YELLING. 
LOIS (O.S.) If I have to read one more vampire story, I swear I'll drive a stake through my own goddamn heart. 
MANUSCRIPT comes flying out of her office. Loose pages splatter everywhere in the main office. Lois Piper quickly follows. Older. Tired. Needs a drink. Now. 
CAPTION: LOIS PIPER 
LOIS (CONT'D) Vampires! Zombies! Harry Potter knock-offs! People writing about their dogs! Just shoot me now! 
It is at that moment when Lois first notices the camera. Caught off-guard. What the hell??? Colette cranes her neck over the assistant. 
COLETTE Ms. Piper?   Ms. Piper? 
Lois turns her attention to Colette. Who are you? Then-- magically--Lois changes. A big smile replaces the scowl. She marches towards Colette, who is clearly not expecting a warm reception. 
Lois walks right past Colette and instead warmly shakes hands with Dr. Xiroman. 
LOIS Dr. Xiroman. I can't believe you're here. How lovely to see you again. 
Dr. Xiroman nods his head in greeting. 
LOIS (CONT'D) Just in the neighborhood? Please come in for a minute. 
Another glance at the camera. Then, taking Dr. Xiroman by the elbow, Lois guides him back towards her office, completely snubbing a bewildered Colette. 
LOIS (CONT'D) My family talks about you all the time. You were so helpful to my sister. She's doing much better. 
Colette stands there helplessly, watching her future walk away. The assistant points in their direction: Get in there! 
96   INT. PIPER OFFICE - DAY                                          96 
Lois plops down behind her desk. Stacks of MANUSCRIPTS cover her desk. Dr. Xiroman sits quietly in one chair. Colette sits next to him. 
LOIS (Sighing; Distraught) Look at my desk, Dr. Xiroman. Look at all this. Do you know what it is? Crap. It's all crap. Crap. Crap. Crap. I hate my job. I hate my life. 
Dr. Xiroman nods: I understand. 
LOIS (CONT'D) Know what I feel like doing? 
She looks at the camera. 
LOIS (CONT'D) Come in closer. I want you to get this. Closer. C'mon. More. Closer. 
Satisfied, Lois takes her free hand and SHOVES ALL THE MANUSCRIPTS off her desk, sending them flying on the floor. 
LOIS (CONT'D) Wheeeeee! 
Colette looks aghast.   Lois seems free at last. 
LOIS (CONT'D) That was so...liberating. I haven't felt this good since that night in Paris with Salman Rushdie. 
Lois growls like a tiger at the memory. 
LOIS (CONT'D) I envy you, Dr. Xiroman. Know that? Look at your life. Your work. You helped my sister. You've helped so many people. You have such a positive message to share. 
The camera picks up on Lois as the light goes on, the wheels start turning in her head. 
LOIS (CONT'D) Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. A positive message to share. Helping people. That's it! 
COLETTE (Confused) What? 
HANNAH He's making me a better writer. 
HENRY Yeah.    I bet he is. 
Quietly seething, Henry nods towards the camera. 
HENRY (CONT'D) How much better are you, Hannah? Show us. Who wrote Slaughterhouse Five? D'ya know? 
HANNAH Henry.    Don't. 
HENRY No, No. This could be quite educational. How about Native Son? Catch-22? 
HANNAH Why isn't it enough that I'm your friend? 
HENRY Lord of the Flies? Portnoy's Complaint? Do you know any author? Harry Potter--You must know Harry Potter. 
HANNAH Why isn't it enough that I believe in your writing? 
HENRY --Sophie's Choice? Anything published in the English language. 
HANNAH --That I believe in you? 
HENRY You didn't read Gatsby, did you? Never even opened it, I bet. 
Enough. 
HANNAH I'm not-- 
She hesitates.   Not for long. 
HANNAH (CONT'D) I'm not the one delivering pizzas for a living. 
Score one for Hannah. 
HANNAH (CONT'D) I'm not the one wasting my talent. You've read all those books, sure, but my book is being published. Is yours? 
Henry has no comeback. Hannah stares him down. The dollar bill drops from her hand on to the ground. She retreats back inside the house, firmly closing the front door, leaving Henry alone. 
Only then do we notice the number of the house: 4441. 
101   INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                   101 
We've never seen Henry like this. He rips down all his Richard Benedict photos from the wall. Collects all his Benedict books. Stuffs everything in a CARDBOARD BOX. Next he turns his attention to all the rejection letters on the wall. Lot of rejection. Gives them a long look. Then he snaps up the photo of Hannah from near his computer. He takes the photo and tacks it dead center in the middle of all his rejection letters. 
Henry stares at the photo, oblivious to the camera, consumed by Hannah's radiant smile. His latest, and most painful, rejection. It's over. 
Henry understands what must be done. He goes over to his desk. Sits down at his laptop. One last glance over at Hannah's photo as he turns the computer on. 
He contemplates for a second. Then begins typing. 
102   INT. JOHN'S MOBILE HOME - DAY                                    102 
Sigrid's Wall of America has been taken down. A few nail holes and tape marks are all that remain--except for the single PHOTO of John still hanging in the center. 
103   EXT. JOHN'S MOBILE HOME - DAY                                      103 
Back to the two lawn chairs--with one prime difference. Sigrid's chair is empty. John sits by himself. This is a softer, more reflective, John talking to the camera. 
JOHN Well, Strudel shipped out. 
A side glance to the empty chair. 
JOHN (CONT'D) Oh, she wanted to stay, but... I didn't have time for a relationship. Not with my book selling like it is. She, well, she became collateral damage. Hated to end it. What a dame. I mean...Sigrid. She had the smarts of my first wife. The body of my second wife. Thank god she wasn't anything like my third wife. I did the right thing. Yes, sir. 
Good acting, John. He looks back to the empty chair. Can't avoid reaching over and giving the arm rest a little love tap. 
104   INT.   JOHN'S MOBILE HOME - DAY                                    104 
John packs COPIES OF HIS BOOK ever-so-carefully into an old standard issue military DUFFEL BAG. 
JOHN (V.O.) What matters now is that the Roaring Lion book tour is about to begin. Can't wait to hit the road and meet the good people of this nation. Good American people. 
John gazes over at his photo on the wall. Salutes himself. 
105   INT. ALAN AND COLETTE'S HOUSE -- DINING ROOM - NIGHT               105 
ALAN Stop it... 
COLETTE No, this is what it's all about. The spotlight always has to be on Little Miss Sunshine. Her agent. Her book deal. Her movie deal. 
John shoots to his feet. 
JOHN News flash for you all. John K. Butzin is also saying Sayonara. Heading off on my international book tour. 
HENRY International? 
JOHN Damn straight. Tijuana. (Beat) I'm done with you pussies. 
John snatches up his folder and marches out of the house. Silence. Colette starts to sit down at the table--motions for Xiroman to join her. Final straw for Alan. Stares directly at Colette. 
ALAN Get out.    Now. 
Colette can't believe what she's hearing. 
ALAN (CONT'D) As the leader of this writing group, I've determined your actions are contrary to our stated purpose. Get out. 
COLETTE You can't kick me out.    I live here. 
She's right.    Alan considers his options. 
ALAN Fine.   Then go to your room. 
Points to Xiroman. 
ALAN (CONT'D) And take him with you. Won't be the first guy. 
Alan means business.   Colette stands up straight.   Gathers up her materials. 
COLETTE We'll certainly have plenty to discuss in therapy. 
ALAN Go by yourself. I'm done. 
COLETTE Oh. Just like always--Alan finishes first. 
She grabs Dr. Xiroman's arm. 
COLETTE (CONT'D) Come, Dr. Xiroman. I'm looking forward to working with a real doctor. On our new book. 
Colette and Dr. Xiroman disappear. Frustrated, Alan takes a deep breath. Reaches inside his coat pocket for his recorder. Turns it on. 
ALAN Idea for novel. 
Alan hesitates. Thinks for a second. Turns off the recorder. Slides it across the table to Henry. 
ALAN (CONT'D) Here. Take it. Maybe you can use some of my ideas in your novel. 
Alan flashes a "thumbs up" sign to Henry and to Hannah.    He starts to leave, but remembers the camera. 
ALAN (CONT'D) (To camera) This was supposed to be a reality series. 
That's off his chest. Alan leaves Henry and Hannah alone at the table. Awkward silence. 
He stands up. Calmly puts his typed pages back in his satchel. Leaves Alan's recorder on the table, walks away without looking back. 
HANNAH Henry . . . 
Don't waste your breath. He's gone. 
106   INT. BOOKSTORE - DAY                                              106 
Hannah's book release party. Great turnout. Her professional PHOTO adorns a POSTER announcing the publication of Sleeping on the Moon. Boy, Hannah looks terrific in that photo. Richard hovers around the makeshift bar, drink in hand. Maureen, looking radiant, accepts the congratulations of well-wishers. TABLE prominently centered has piles of Hannah's novel, waiting to be signed. 
Hannah talks to the camera, looking especially radiant. This is her day and she is more than ready for her close-up. Totally different in wardrobe and appearance. 
HANNAH Exciting, isn't it? I'm so nervous. I don't know half these people. Most of them are Richard's friends. 
Hannah waves to Richard. He waves back. Hannah glances around the room, as if looking for someone in particular. 
HANNAH (CONT'D) Nobody's showed up from my old writing group. Not one. Probably shouldn't be surprised. Haven't really heard from anyone in months. 
She is asked a question. 
HANNAH Oh, c'mon.   You'll -- 
Then -- BAM, Henry, not looking where he's going, slams into Richard accidentally, spilling Richard's drink all over the author. Horrified looks all around. 
108   EXT. OUTSIDE BOOKSTORE - DAY                                       108 
Outside the bookstore, Henry stands on the sidewalk, talking to the camera as he clutches Hannah's book. 
HENRY Well, I did it. I showed up to Hannah's signing. I congratulated her. I supported her, writer to writer. And I finally got introduced to Richard Benedict--formally. Sort of. 
Henry opens up his copy of Hannah's novel. He turns quiet, obviously moved. He holds the book up for the camera to see. 
HENRY (CONT'D) Look. Hannah dedicated her novel to me. Just like she promised. 
Right beneath the printed dedication For Henry Obert, Hannah has written, For Henry, My Forever Friend xoxoxo Hannah. 
Henry studies the book for a second. Snaps it shut. 
109   INT. KELLER OFFICE - DAY                                           109 
Literary agent David Keller being interviewed for the camera in his office. Stacks of MANUSCRIPTS on his desk. David pulls one out. 
DAVID This is why I love LA. True story. This guy delivers a pizza to my house one night. Then the very next week, my wife has someone come in and clean the carpets. Guess what? Same guy. Small world, isn't it? So we get talking. He tells me his name's Henry. He's a writer. He's just finished a manuscript. Offers us a discount on the carpets if I'll read ten pages. I like that thinking. So I read ten pages. Wow. I want to read ten more. Before I know it, I've read the entire book. (MORE) 
DAVID (CONT'D) Just loved it. Fresh voice. Interesting characters. And that ending. 
David thumbs through the manuscript. 
DAVID (CONT'D) The washed-up, impotent novelist getting gunned down by Scott, the jealous, underemployed, pizza delivery man. This kid nailed it. It's on the page, know what I mean? So I intend to sign Mr. Henry Obert and get Pizza to Go out there. I predict a best seller. Probably a movie, too. I'll call him with the good news. Or maybe I'll just order a pizza. 
110   INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - DAY                                       110 
Henry taking down the rejection letters from his walls and packing them in a cardboard BOX. 
HENRY (V.O.) David Keller did call me. One week later, he sold Pizza to Go to a New York publisher. They decided to rename it A Slice of LA. I did it. I sold my novel. 
Henry puts the last of the rejection letters away. Finally, he picks up a FRAMED PHOTO. INSERT shows the six members of the writing group from happier times--the photo snapped in the restaurant. Full of hope and promise. 
HENRY (V.O.) (CONT'D) I miss the Tuesday night group. They made me a better writer. They taught me how to handle rejection. 
Henry lingers on the photo before packing it away, as well. 
111   INT. RESTAURANT #2 - DAY                                           111 
Mostly empty. Henry sits at a booth, alone, a new copy of Gatsby in his hands. He talks to the camera. CUP OF COFFEE in front of him. 
HENRY Hannah was right. The writing must always come first. Everything else waits. Everything. That's what I did finally. Finished my novel. (MORE) 
HENRY (CONT'D) Sold it. Now? Now I'm open. Ready for whatever-- 
WAITRESS stops by the table, refilling Henry's cup. Then setting the pot on the table, she reaches over and snatches the copy of Gatsby. 
Surprised, Henry glances up. 
HENRY (CONT'D) --happens next... 
It's her again. That young waitress with purple streaks in her hair and matching purple glasses thumbs through the book. Henry finally checks out her name tag: Eudora. 
Clutching the book, Eudora recites from memory: 
EUDORA Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter-- 
HENRY (Surprised) --Tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms further... 
Eudora nods. Henry is amazed. 
HENRY (CONT'D) You know Fitzgerald? 
EUDORA Not intimately. He died here, you know. 
HENRY December 21, 1940. 
EUDORA I go by there sometimes. 
HENRY The place on Hayworth. 
ALAN (V.O.) After I sent Colette packing, I was ready for a new chapter in my life... 
SATURDAY'S ADULT EDUCATION CLASSES. 
PUPPET MAKING meets in Room 22, and QUILTING is in Room 24. WRITING 20/20 is in Room 26. 
And DOG OBEDIENCE is out in the courtyard, but we already know that--the loud sound of BARKING DOGS and PEOPLE YELLING "SIT" is heard in the background. 
Second poster is a new version of QUIET, PLEASE--WRITERS AT WORK. 
ALAN (V.O.) (CONT'D) I found it teaching Adult Ed. "Writing 20/20" is the class. Helping writers to see. Inspired by my new self- published e-book of the same title. 
116   INT. SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY                                        116 
STUDENTS scattered around the classroom. All adult. Ethnic and demographic mix. Listening attentively. Taking notes. The DOGS continue barking outside. 
Alan stands in front of the class. Beaming. Excited, He CLAPS his hands once. 
ALAN OK. You've got ten seconds. Write down the name of your character. First name that pops into mind. C'mon. Tell me your character. 
Students think for a second. Start scribbling a name. 
ALAN (CONT'D) 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-9.5-9.75-10 seconds. OK. Pass your names up front here. Let's see what you came up with. 
Students hand their papers forward. Alan starts collecting them. 
ALAN (CONT'D) The right name is so important for your character. OK. What do we have? 
He looks at the first piece of paper. 
ALAN (CONT'D) Here's one I haven't heard. Heywood Ja-Jabloom??? 
That's not it.   Alan tries again. 
ALAN (CONT'D) Or is it Jablom? Maybe Jablowme. Heywood Jablowme? 
Laughter and guffaws from the students.    Alan looks puzzled. 
ALAN (CONT'D) What's so funny? Heywood Jablowme? Am I missing something? Heywood Jablowme? 
The students continue to laugh. Poor Alan. 
117   EXT. ALAN AND COLETTE'S HOUSE - DAY                               117 
Catch the FOR SALE sign posted on the front lawn. 
118   EXT. COLETTE'S GARDEN - DAY                                       118 
Colette engages in intense meditation on her bench. The garden around her is now dead. 
COLETTE (V.O.) Dr. Xiroman and I wrote our book. It actually did fairly well. 
INSERT BOOK. Title in large letters: Getting from Xiro to One by Dr. Xiroman in equally large letters. At the bottom of the book, in very tiny letters, reads With Colette Mooney. 
COLETTE (V.O.) (CONT'D) Dr. Phil turned us down. But we had a lovely time on Anderson. 
INSERT PHOTO of smiling Anderson Cooper. 
COLETTE (CONT'D) Anderson actually wanted us back, but Dr. Xiroman and Lois Piper started dating. They eloped to Vegas last month. Off on a world cruise. 
INSERT PHOTO of Dr. Xiroman and Lois being married in Vegas by ELVIS.

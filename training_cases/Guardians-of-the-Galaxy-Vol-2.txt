BLACK: 
O.S. "BRANDY" by LOOKING GLASS PLAYS. 
EXT. FORD COBRA MUSTANG - DAY 
SUPER: MISSOURI EARTH 
OVERHEAD SHOT: A `79 Cobra winds alongside the Missouri River, past swaying loosestrife, vibrant sugar maples, and oily self-pump gas stations. A hazy sun glints off the hood of the Cobra which, like its descendant the Milano, is orange and teal. 
We MOVE DOWN AND IN on a fresh-faced girl of 18 in the passenger seat: MEREDITH QUILL. As "Brandy" blasts from the car stereo, she pushes her fine, feathered hair from her mouth, and sings along, out-of-tune - 
MEREDITH Do do do do do do do do do do do! 
The driver, a MYSTERIOUS MAN in his 30's, dressed in sleek, mod attire, LAUGHS. 
Meredith LAUGHS too. She SINGS and dances with abandon in her seat. She's a lively goofball, and it's apparent where Peter Quill received much of his personality. 
EXT. DAIRY QUEEN/WOODS - MOMENTS LATER 
The Cobra pulls beside this Dairy Queen in a desolate area. 
EXT. WOODS BEHIND DAIRY QUEEN - MOMENTS LATER 
The Mysterious Man helps Meredith down the steep hillside into the woods. "Brandy" continues to play on the car stereo in the lot behind them. Meredith GIGGLES. 
MYSTERIOUS MAN This way, my river lily. 
MEREDITH Where are you taking me? 
The Mysterious Man shows her a STRANGE SPROUT nestled amongst the trees. 
A few inches tall and decidedly alien in nature, its delicate limbs twist and turn in a complex pattern. 
MEREDITH (CONT'D) Oh. It's beautiful. 
The Mysterious Man looks proudly at Meredith. With a perpetually excited glint in his eye, and the air of a self- empowerment guru, he is an intoxicating presence. 
MYSTERIOUS MAN I was afraid it wouldn't take to the soil, but it rooted quickly. 
He nods toward the sky between the branches above. 
MYSTERIOUS MAN (CONT'D) Soon it will be everywhere - all across the universe, fulfilling life's one true purpose. 
MEREDITH Which is what? 
MYSTERIOUS MAN Expansion. 
The Mysterious Man takes her in his arms.    He gazes into her eyes. She grows almost teary. 
MEREDITH I'm not sure what you're talking about. But I like the way you say it. 
MYSTERIOUS MAN My heart is yours, Meredith Quill. 
MEREDITH I can't believe I fell in love with a spaceman. 
And they KISS, with passion, and love. "DO DO DO DO DO DO DO DO DO DO DO!" sings Looking Glass as SOURCE BECOMES SCORE and we TILT DOWN to the plant. It TWITCHES AND GROWS AND TWISTS. 
We PUSH IN ON IT, where we see the plant is made, not only of cellulose and leaves, but of a BRIGHT COSMIC LIGHT. And we KEEPING PUSHING IN, INTO THE PLANT ITSELF, more FLESH-LIKE than you'd imagine, where COLORFUL BACTERIA OVERCOMES US as "BRANDY" DISTORTS AND TRANSFORMS into something epic. 
O.S. A CRACK OF INTERDIMENSIONAL THUNDER 
SUPER: 34 Years Later 
EXT. THE SOVEREIGN - OUTER SPACE 
An artificial, golden planet, made of interlocking orbs, revolves around a blue sun. 
We PUSH IN on THUNDEROUS INTERDIMENSIONAL CRACKS on one small patch of planet. 
SUPER: THE SOVEREIGN M49 5IOL339P21+H9LNI31 
I/E. POWER STATION - DAY 
A DIMENSIONAL CRACK SNAPS in the sky overhead. PETER QUILL looks from it to an old MATTEL ELECTRONICS FOOTBALL GAME converted into a tracker. A RED DOT APPROACHES. 
QUILL Showtime, a-holes! It'll be here any minute! 
GAMORA (O.S.) Which will be its loss. 
Quill turns toward GAMORA, loading a rifle. DRAX, ROCKET, and BABY GROOT also ready themselves for battle in this grand, open-air power station. Dozens of BATTERIES are couched in conductor towers encircling them. Quill, Gamora, and Rocket wear flying rigs. 
QUILL Is that a rifle? 
GAMORA You don't know what a rifle is? 
QUILL I thought your thing was a sword. 
GAMORA We've been hired to stop an interdimensional beast from feeding on those batteries' energy, and I'm going to stop it with a sword? 
QUILL (mumbling to himself) Don't look at me like I'm stupid. You're the one being all inconsistent. 
A LOUDER, LARGER CRACK: something seems to be fighting its way through the sky. 
GAMORA Drax, why aren't you wearing one of Rocket's aero-rigs? 
DRAX It hurts. 
GAMORA Hurts? 
DRAX (MUTTERING) I have sensitive nipples. 
Rocket, who is working on a pair of speakers wired to Quill's Walkman, LAUGHS HARD at this. Drax points at him. 
DRAX (CONT'D) What about him?! What's he doing?! 
ROCKET If I finish this, we can listen to tunes while we work. 
DRAX How is that a priority? 
GAMORA (CONT'D) Drax, no! That doesn't make - 
The creature OPENS ITS ENORMOUS MOUTH, SCREECHING, and Drax LEAPS INSIDE IT, instantly swallowed up. 
QUILL What is he doing?! 
GAMORA He said the skin is too thick to be pierced from the outside, so he -- 
QUILL That doesn't make sense! 
GAMORA I tried to tell -- ! 
QUILL Its skin is the same thickness from the inside as from the out! 
GAMORA I REALIZE THAT. 
INT. BEAST'S STOMACH - DOESN'T MATTER 
Drax HOLLERS as he SLASHES AWAY inside the goo of the beast's stomach. To no avail. 
I/E. POWER STATION - DAY 
Quill reloads his pistol, thinking. 
QUILL Gamora, there's a cut on its neck - Rocket, get it to look up. 
Quill and Rocket JET UP HIGH up over the creature as they BLAST REPEATEDLY at it. 
QUILL (CONT'D) Hey, you giant Sea Monkey, up here! 
Gamora's rifle is jammed.    She tosses it down.   PULLS HER SWORD. SNAPS IT OPEN. 
The beast SCREECHES at Quill and Rocket FLYING overhead.       The colorful SPLATTER MATTER FLIES FROM ITS MOUTH, BATTERING ROCKET, BURNING his clothes. 
But its neck is exposed, where the skin is thinner, and there is a small wound. 
Gamora DASHES, LEAPING HIGH into the air, and she PLUNGES her sword directly into the wound. 
She holds tight to the hilt as she FALLS, SLICING AN INCISION down the length of the creature's neck. 
The beast WOBBLES, TOPPLES, and DIES. As it COLLAPSES, Drax SPILLS OUT of the wound. He raises his arms in victory. 
DRAX Ha ha! I have single-handedly vanquished the beast! 
Quill SCOFFS. Rocket SNORTS. Gamora stares at him, dead-eyed. Baby Groot throws a rock at him. 
DRAX (CONT'D) What? 
I/E. POWER STATION - MOMENTS LATER 
The Guardians de-rig by the Anulax batteries. 
DRAX What are they called again? 
QUILL Anulax batteries. 
DRAX Harbulary batteries. 
QUILL That's nothing like what I just said. But they're worth thousands of units a piece. Which is why the Sovereign hired us to protect them. 
Rocket pulls out one of the ANULAX BATTERIES, checking it out. 
Gamora, Drax, and Quill walk on. Rocket stays back a moment. Quill nods down the walkway, where GOLDEN SOVEREIGN CITIZENS stand at the edge of the station, gawking. 
QUILL (CONT'D) Just be careful what you say around these folks. They're easily offended and the cost of transgression is death. 
DRAX Sounds judgmental for a bunch of golden morons. 
QUILL That's the kind of thing you might want to keep to yourself. 
GAMORA I'll hold my tongue, as long as they deliver what was promised. 
EXT. LAIR OF THE HIGH PRIESTESS - MORNING 
An enormous golden palace in the shape of a globe, dappled by morning sunlight. 
AYESHA (O.S.) We thank you, Guardians, for putting your life on the line. We could not risk the lives of our own Sovereign citizens. 
INT. LAIR OF THE HIGH PRIESTESS - DAY 
HIGH PRIESTESS AYESHA is stunningly beautiful with golden skin. Her CHAMBERMAIDS and other DENIZENS flutter throughout her luxurious lair, all of whom are equally perfect. 
AYESHA Every citizen is born exactly as designed by the community, impeccable, both physically and mentally. We control the DNA of our progeny, germinating them in birthing pods. 
QUILL I guess I prefer making people the old-fashioned way. 
AYESHA Well... perhaps someday you could give me a history lesson in the archaic ways of our ancestors... for academic purposes. 
QUILL Yeah, I mean, if it's for research that could be pretty -- 
Quill sees Gamora staring at him. 
QUILL (CONT'D) Pretty repulsive. I'm not into that kind of casual - 
GAMORA Oh, please. (TO AYESHA) Your people promised something in trade for our services. Bring it and we shall gladly be on our way. 
Ayesha nods. 
Two SOLDIERS emerge with A WOMAN in a hood and cloak, her wrists bound by SHACKLES. They SHOVE HER TO HER KNEES and yank back her hood, REVEALING -- 
NEBULA. Her clothes are tattered.    Her hand is now just a low- tech metal claw. 
She glares at Gamora. Gamora glares at her. Quill looks from one to the other, feeling the tension. 
QUILL (QUIETLY) Family reunion. Yaaaay. 
AYESHA I understand she is your sister? 
Gamora roughly picks Nebula up, starts to go. 
GAMORA She's worth no more to me than the bounty due for her on Xandar. 
AYESHA Our soldiers apprehended her attempting to steal the batteries. Do with her as you please. 
QUILL Thank you, High Priestess Ayesha. 
Quill and Gamora enter this private spot; the campfire flickers through the trees beyond them. 
QUILL Give me a break! After all this time, and he just expects to be my Dad all of the sudden! 
GAMORA I hear you. 
QUILL I mean, this could be a trap - the Kree purists, the Ravagers, now the Sovereign - they all want us dead. 
GAMORA I know, but - 
QUILL But what? 
GAMORA What was that story you told me about Zardu Hasselfrau? 
QUILL Who? 
GAMORA The wonderful television-singer man. He had a magic boat. 
QUILL David Hasselhoff? 
GAMORA Right. 
QUILL He had a talking car, not a magic - 
GAMORA Why did it talk again? 
QUILL Just to be a good friend, I guess. 
GAMORA And as a child you carried his picture in your pocket, and you told the other children he was your father, but he was out of town -- 
QUILL (EMBARRASSED) Shooting Knight Rider or touring with his band in Germany. Why are you bringing this up now? I was drunk when I told you that. 
GAMORA I love that story. 
QUILL I don't. It's just sad! I was so sad because I'd see the other kids off playing catch with their dads, and I wanted that, more than anything in the world. 
Gamora takes Quill's hands in her own. 
GAMORA My point is, maybe this man is your Hasselhoff. I know it's a long shot. But I lost my father as a child. I'd give anything... 
Quill nods, grudgingly. 
GAMORA (CONT'D) If he ends up being evil, we'll just kill him. 
Quill CHUCKLES. 
GAMORA (CONT'D) What's funny? 
I/E. CRASHED MILANO - SUNRISE 
Inside the ship, "THE CHAIN" BY FLEETWOOD MAC PLAYS on the cassette player. Nebula is angry. 
NEBULA You're leaving me with that fox?! 
Rocket is SOLDERING the ship. 
GAMORA He's not a fox. 
Gamora glances at Rocket as she grabs her outer-space- adventurer version of luggage. 
GAMORA (CONT'D) Shoot her if she does anything suspicious. Or if you feel like it. 
Rocket GRUNTS.    Gamora looks at a sad Baby Groot. 
GAMORA (CONT'D) It will just be a couple days. We'll be back before Rocket's finished fixing the ship. 
Gamora steps out. Rocket sees Groot, who is ABOUT TO CRY as he watches them go. 
Drax and Quill come from the back of the ship. 
DRAX What about your spool of songs? 
QUILL I have clones. 
DRAX What if the Sovereign come? 
QUILL There's no way for them to know they're here. 
DRAX I am uncertain about parting ways. 
QUILL You're like an old woman. 
DRAX Because I am wise? 
Quill turns to Rocket as Drax and Gamora head toward the ship. He starts to say something nice - perhaps something conciliatory but -- 
ROCKET Hope daddy isn't as big of a dick as you, orphan boy. 
Quill just shakes his head and SNICKERS. 
QUILL So what's your goal here? To get everyone to hate you? `Cause it's working. 
Quill turns back around with Gamora and Drax and walks away. 
Rocket looks at the others leaving as THE SONG BECOMES SCORE: I can still hear you saying you will never break the chain. Rocket watches them move away. 
IN SLOW-MOTION, Quill, Drax, and Gamora approach the oval ship. The slit opens. Ego, with Mantis, is waiting inside. 
Ego smiles and CLASPS his hand on Quill as he enters. 
INT. EGOS SHIP. SUNRISE 
Quill sits back against the wall, alone, nervous. He looks across the way at a SLEEP CHAMBER, where Mantis helps Ego lie down on a slab. 
She places her hand on his forehead with her hand: her antennae ALIGHT. And he drifts off to sleep. 
Quill takes a small, folded piece of paper out of his pocket. 
It's the PHOTO OF DAVID HASSELHOFF. 
He looks at it, then looks at Ego.    Quill's eyes fill with cautious hope. And the SONG ENDS. 
EXT. BERHERT - MOMENTS LATER 
Ego's ship rises, blocking out the sun. 
Four moons shine over the forest. The campfire CRACKLES beside the Milano, and "SOUTHERN NIGHTS" BY GLENN CAMPBELL emerges from the cassette player within. 
The Monstrous Ravager and Kraglin lead a group of Ravagers up over a ravine. Dozens of M-Ships quietly lower behind them. Kraglin nods toward the sounds of Glenn Campbell in the distance. They raise their weapons. 
OVERHEAD SHOT: dozens and dozens of Ravagers come from different directions, surrounding the Milano. 
One Ravager cluster, lead by Half-Nut, CREEPS close enough to the Milano that they see the lights within the vehicle and can hear Rocket inside HUMMING along to the song. 
Half-Nut licks his lips in anticipation, closing in for the kill, when he steps on a small pedal. It CLICKS. 
A HUNDRED DARTS FLY AT THE GROUP from traps set in trees. They STICK INTO THE RAVAGERS' BODIES, knocking them instantly unconscious. As one Ravager FALLS, a GUNSHOT is discharged. 
INT. CRASHED MILANO - NIGHT 
Nebula is awakened by the SHOT. She sees a frightened Groot, peering through a hole at the bodies falling. 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL, beside him, a futuristic walkie-talkie with ROCKET'S HUMS emerging. 
EXT. CRASHED MILANO - PERCUSSIVE BOMB TRAP - NIGHT 
Rocket is crouched on a limb in shadows above the Milano, smiling and HUMMING to "Southern Nights" into his comm. 
He spots A LARGER GROUP OF RAVAGERS APPROACHING THE MILANO from the other side, led by Retch. 
Rocket LEAPS TOWARD THEM, from one tree limb to another like a squirrel. 
The GROUP enters a clearing close to the ship. A TALL RAVAGER looks up and spots Rocket LEAPING OVER THEIR HEADS. 
TALL RAVAGER There! 
The Ravagers BLAST at Rocket, following him. He HOPS from tree to tree as BULLETS WHIZZ PAST HIM, leading them right where he wants them. 
He stops in a tree at the end of the run.   He holds a device with two buttons. He presses one of them. 
A PERCUSSIVE BOMB at the feet of the Ravagers BURSTS, sending half of them FLYING UP into the air. 
As the confused group on the ground watches, Rocket presses the second button and a second BOMB BURSTS. They FLY UP INTO THE AIR as well. 
Rocket SNICKERS, as he continues pushes the buttons and the two groups of Ravagers FLY UP and DOWN until the bombs are depleted of energy. 
Retch looks up from the ground, to see the little animal hopping away in the tree limbs overhead. 
EXT. CRASHED MILANO - STICKY DISK TRAP - NIGHT 
An EVEN LARGER GROUP OF RAVAGERS walk beneath the branches, MOONLIGHT FLICKERING ON THEIR FACES. 
TILT UP TO REVEAL ROCKET'S SILHOUETTE on a gnarled limb. He's clutching an armful of small discs. He breathes shallowly, waits. As soon as the last Ravager is passing beneath him, he LEAPS onto his back. 
Rocket JUMPS FORWARD FROM ONE MAN TO THE NEXT, SLAPPING A STICKY-DISC to each of their heads - SLAP! SLAP! SLAP! SLAP! 
And then he LEAPS from the Ravager at the front of the line BACK UP INTO THE TREES. 
The men are confused. They bring their fingers to the sticky discs on their bodies. 
Rocket smiles in the tree as he flicks a trigger. The STICKY- DISCS SEND ELECTRICITY COURSING THROUGH ALL OF THE MEN'S BODIES. 
They CONVULSE for a moment, then COLLAPSE. 
EXT. CRASHED MILANO - CLEARING - NIGHT 
Rocket LEAPS to the ground in a crouch. He sees Brahl approaching in front of him, and then another RAVAGER approaching from behind. They train their weapons on him. 
BRAHL Ain't so tough now without all your toys, are you? 
Rocket LEAPS up onto Brahl's face. 
He PUNCHES HIM IN THE THORAX so hard he can't breathe. 
The other Ravager SHOOTS at him, but Rocket BACKFLIPS over the SHOT so Brahl is STRUCK instead. 
Rocket LANDS on the back of the shooter's neck and RAPID-FIRE PUNCHES HIM in the head, until the man CRUMPLES to the ground, unconscious. 
As Rocket lands, he HEARS WHISTLING and he looks up to see -- 
YONDU'S ARROW FLYING THROUGH THE TREES, DIRECTLY TOWARD HIM. 
ROCKET Crap. 
Another high-pitched WHISTLE and the arrow STOPS ABRUPTLY, FLOATING with the tip almost grazing Rocket's forehead. 
Yondu waltzes out of the trees with Tullk, Kraglin, the Monstrous Ravager, and many more. 
Rocket reluctantly raises his hands in surrender. 
YONDU Hey there, rat. 
ROCKET How's it going, you blue idiot? 
YONDU Eh, not so bad. We got a pretty good gig. A golden gal with quite a high opinion of herself offered us a large sum to deliver you and your pals to her, so she can kill y'all. 
INT. CRASHED MILANO - NIGHT 
Nebula looks out the window to see even more Ravagers surrounding Rocket. She looks at baby Groot. 
NEBULA Your friend. There's too many of them. They're going to kill him. 
Groot looks as if he's about to cry. 
NEBULA (CONT'D) He needs my help. If you care about him, you need to get me out of these bonds. 
Groot is unsure. 
EXT. CRASHED MILANO - CLEARING - NIGHT 
The Ravagers have entirely encircled Rocket. There's no chance of escape. Though upset, he mostly holds it in. 
YONDU Pretty easy to find you, since we put a tracer on your ship back during the War over Xandar. 
ROCKET You give me your word you won't hurt Groot, and I'll tell you where the batteries are. 
YONDU Lucky for you my word don't mean squat. Otherwise I'd actually hand you over. 
MONSTROUS RAVAGER Otherwise you'd what?! 
Yondu scowls at the Monstrous Ravager. 
DRAX When was I that tiny? 
Gamora shakes her head in disbelief. They step past the statue and onto the steps approaching the palace. 
GAMORA You own a planet and can destroy two dozen spaceships without a suit. What are you, exactly? 
EGO I'm what they call a Celestial, sweetheart. 
The Guardians STOP behind him, astounded. 
QUILL A Celestial. Like a... god? 
EGO Small `g', son. At least on the days I'm feeling humble as Drax. 
He LAUGHS and walks up the stairs. 
INT. PALACE - MOMENTS LATER 
Ego SAUNTERS with Quill, Gamora, Drax, and Mantis, through the enormous open doors, toward huge DIORAMAS lining either side of the palace, like cosmic Stations of the Cross. 
EGO This form you see before you is only an extension of who I truly am. I don't know where I came from, exactly. 
The DIORAMAS around them begin to ANIMATE: In the first, a FLICKERING BRAIN COMPOSED OF POLYCHROMATIC LIGHT FLOATS in space. 
EGO (CONT'D) The first thing I remember is flickering, adrift in the cosmos - utterly and entirely alone. 
The flickering brain pulls cosmic dust and rocks into itself, ingesting them, GROWING. 
EGO (CONT'D) I fed on the matter around me like plankton. I grew smarter and stronger. 
A hard metal shell forms around the brain, with channels running through for his energy to flow like rivers. 
EGO (CONT'D) I formed a sheathe to protect myself from the elements. 
Ego continues developing outward from the shell, growing the planet, then its beautiful landscapes and structures. 
EGO (CONT'D) And continued building from there, layer by layer, the very planet you walk on now. I built the spires reaching up to the sky and the tunnels burrowing into its depths. 
QUILL Wow. 
EGO But I was no ant to be fulfilled solely by labor. I wanted more. I desired... meaning. 
In the core shell - the Self Chamber - the flickering brain floats, alone, perhaps sad. 
EGO (CONT'D) There must be some life out there in the universe besides just me, I thought, and I set myself to task with finding it. 
The brain grows a SKELETAL FRAMEWORK OF LIGHT up from the self chamber and to the surface of the planet. He pulls molecules around this shape to create his "human" self. 
EGO (CONT'D) I created what I imagined biological life might be like, down to the most minute detail. 
DRAX Did you make a penis? 
QUILL Dude. 
DRAX If he's a planet, how did he make a baby with your mother? He would smush her. 
QUILL I don't need to hear about how my parents, you know - 
DRAX Why? My father would tell me the story of impregnating my mother every winter solstice. 
QUILL That's disgusting. 
DRAX It was beautiful. You earthers have hang-ups. 
EGO Yes, Drax, I've got a penis. 
QUILL Oh my God. 
EGO It's not half bad. I've also got pain receptors, a digestive system, and all the accompanying junk. I wanted to experience what it truly meant to be human as I set out amongst the stars. 
In another DIORAMA, Ego explores various uninhabited and barren planets. 
EGO (CONT'D) I visited thousands of planets over thousands of years, one barren husk after the next until I found what I sought... 
Ego stares down at a CUTE ALIEN CHILD. 
EGO (CONT'D) Life. I was not alone in this universe after all. 
Ego reminisces: wistful? Sad? It's hard to tell. 
QUILL When did you meet my mother? 
EGO Not long after. 
Ego turns toward the last set of DIORAMAS. They show Meredith and Ego kissing and Ego with his hand on Meredith's pregnant belly. 
EGO (CONT'D) It was with Meredith that I experienced love for the first time. I called her my river lily. And from that love, Peter, you. 
In the final DIORAMA we PUSH IN on the belly and see, inside the womb, VERY young Peter Quill, a fetus, himself encased in light. 
Quill looks up in amazement - this story is the story of himself. And Ego gazes at Quill with adoration. 
EGO (CONT'D) I searched for you for so long. When I heard a man from earth held an Infinity Stone in his hand without dying, I knew you must be the son of the woman I loved. 
Ego puts his hand on Quill. Quill wants to believe, but he can't quite let it go. 
QUILL If you loved her why did you leave her? 
EXT. THE ECLECTOR - OUTER SPACE 
The Ravagers' massive ship FLOATS in space. 
SUPER: RAVAGER TERRITORY HE2 6SM6R16617+6241023 
TULLK (O.S.) You can't do this! 
INT. ECLECTOR CENTRAL AREA - OUTER SPACE 
Ravagers LAUGH as they DRAG Tullk across the floor while he STRUGGLES to get free. 
TULLK This is mutiny! Mutiny! 
They shove Tullk into a cylindrical room as a glass door CLOSES on him. 
He continues SCREAMING and SLAMMING ON THE GLASS, but we can barely hear him. 
KRAGLIN Yeah... I was talking about, like, a pretty necklace. Or a nice hat. Something that'll make the other girls go `oooooo, that's nice.' 
Nebula gives him a look of pure death. 
KRAGLIN (CONT'D) Anyway, uh, happy trails. 
INT. PALACE COURTYARD - DAY 
Quill looks up at a GIANT SCULPTURE of his mother. He is upset. Ego is behind him, watching him, sadly. 
QUILL My mother told everyone my father was from the stars. 
Quill turns to look at his father, somewhat accusatory. 
QUILL (CONT'D) She had brain cancer - so everyone thought she was delusional. 
Ego looks sad, ashamed. 
EGO PETER - 
QUILL Listen. I'd love to believe all of this, I really would - but you left the most wonderful woman ever, to die alone! 
Ego has tears in his eyes. 
EGO I didn't want to leave your mother, Peter. But if I don't return regularly to this planet, and the light within, this form will wither and perish -- 
QUILL So why didn't you come back?! Why'd you send Yondu, a criminal, of all people, to fetch me?! 
EGO I loved your mother, Peter! I couldn't stand to set foot on an earth where she wasn't living! You can't imagine what that's like! 
QUILL I know exactly what that's like! I had to watch her die! 
Ego stops, seeming to hear his son.   He touches him. 
EGO Over the millions and millions of years of my existence I have made many mistakes, Peter. But you're not one of them. Please give me the chance to be the father she would want me to be. 
Quill looks at him, vulnerable. 
EGO (CONT'D) There are so many things I need to teach you. This planet, and the light within... they are a part of you. 
QUILL What do you mean? 
Ego takes Quill's hands in his own, gently, putting them in the correct position. 
EGO Give me your hands, son.    Here. Hold them like that. 
Quill holds his hands apart.   Ego steps back, holding his hands in the same way. 
EGO (CONT'D) Now close your eyes and concentrate. Take your brain to the center of the planet. 
Quill concentrates. He holds his hand out.    A white light emanates from it. 
EGO (CONT'D) Yes! Yes! 
QUILL Whoa. 
The light disappears as quickly as it came. 
EGO Yes, yes - it's okay. Just relax. Concentrate. You can do it. Bring it back. 
Quill concentrates and the LIGHT, once again, bursts up from the palms of his hands. 
EGO (CONT'D) Yes, yes, now - shape it - 
Ego shows him, pulling in the molecules around him, so that the light itself forms into the shape of a ball. 
EGO (CONT'D) Feel the energy. 
Quill tries to pull molecules into the ball. And, little by little, they come, and the ball glows brighter. 
EGO (CONT'D) Yes. 
Quill laughs. Ego is JOYOUS. He almost looks as if he's going to break down in tears. 
EGO (CONT'D) You're home, Peter. 
Ego cups his hands. 
EGO (CONT'D) Here. 
Quill, smiling, THROWS him the ball. Ego LAUGHS. He inspects the cosmic ball of light, and he throws it back to Quill. 
Quill LAUGHS, catching it, and throws it back.   Ego moves back further. 
And Ego and Quill continue tossing the ball back and forth there, LAUGHING, a friendly father and son game of catch in the middle of a palace courtyard. 
EXT. PALACE - DAY 
Drax and Mantis sit here, soaking in the sun and gazing at the lush, flowing hills, like something an alien Maxfield Parrish would paint. 
DRAX How did you get here? 
MANTIS Ego found me in my larva state, orphaned on my homeworld. He raised me by hand, and kept me as his own. 
DRAX So you're a pet? 
MANTIS I suppose. 
DRAX People usually want cute pets. Why would Ego want a hideous one? 
MANTIS I am hideous? 
DRAX You're horrifying to look at, yes. 
Mantis seems sad about this.    Drax notice this, feels bad. 
DRAX (CONT'D) But it is a good thing. 
MANTIS Oh? 
DRAX When you are ugly and someone loves you, you know they love you for who you are. Beautiful people never know who to trust. 
MANTIS Well, then I am certainly grateful to be ugly! (THINKING) Poor Gamora. She can never trust anyone. 
Drax nods and stares out at spattered patches of water. 
YONDU (CONT'D) I got an idea on how to get outta here. But we're gonna need your little friend. 
INT. BAR/QUADRANT FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE 
Baby Groot is wearing a tiny Ravager uniform. He reacts to clothes like a cat, struggling to take them off but unable. Ravagers are gathered around him, drunk and LAUGHING. They are CHANTING "MASCOT." 
RETCH Lil' feller's all worked up! Needs a drank! 
Retch POURS ALCOHOL on him. The Ravagers LAUGH MORE as others POUR DRINKS on him as well. Groot SCREAMS at them, furious but helpless. 
RETCH (CONT'D) Lookit how cute it is when it's all riled up! 
HALF-NUT It's Goddang precious! 
INT. ECLECTOR CELL - LATER 
Groot, in shadows, MOPES down the hallway, looking traumatized. His clothes are torn and he's soaked in alcohol. 
As he passes the cell, he hears - 
YONDU (O.S.) Hey, twig. C'mere. 
Groot sees Yondu and Rocket looking at him in the cell. He steps toward them. 
ROCKET Oh, man. What'd they do to you? 
YONDU Hey, you wanna help us get outta here? 
Groot NODS.   Rocket looks unsure. Yondu speaks slowly. 
YONDU (CONT'D) There's something I need you to get, and bring back to me. 
Groot NODS. 
YONDU (CONT'D) In the Cap'n's quarters, there's a prototype fin, like the thing I wore on my head. 
Groot NODS. 
YONDU (CONT'D) There's a drawer next to the bunk. It's inside that. It's red. You got it? 
Groot NODS EMPHATICALLY and DARTS OFF to get it.   Yondu looks at Rocket, pleased. 
Rocket looks more than a bit uncertain. 
INT. CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - MOMENTS LATER 
Baby Groot CREEPS into this dark room.    DRUNKEN RAVAGERS are sprawled everywhere. 
He spots a bureau.    A drawer is half open. 
His face lights up. 
MOMENTS LATER 
Baby Groot stands outside of the cell, beaming, holding A PAIR OF SHORTS. 
YONDU That's my underwears. 
ROCKET Yeah, I was pretty sure he didn't know what you were talking about. You have to explain it more careful. 
YONDU All right. It's a prototype fin - 
MOMENTS LATER 
Groot is back in front of the cell, holding a wriggling ORLONI in his hands. 
ROCKET That's an orloni. It's a fin, Groot. 
YONDU You explain it this time. 
Rocket starts to speak - 
MOMENTS LATER 
Groot looks hopeful, holding out a CYBERNETIC EYE. 
YONDU That's Vorker's eye. He takes it out when he sleeps. Go look again. 
Groot starts to SLINK OFF - 
ROCKET But leave the eye here. 
YONDU Why? 
Rocket CAN HARDLY SPEAK he finds it so funny. 
ROCKET He's gonna wake up tomorrow and he's not gonna know where his eye is! 
MOMENTS LATER 
Groot is DRAGGING a LARGE PIECE OF FURNITURE to the cell. 
ROCKET That's a desk. We told you it was this big. 
Rocket shows him how small it is with his hands. 
Groot makes a face like "Oh!" as if NOW he gets it. It's all coming together. 
MOMENTS LATER 
Groot is holding a SEVERED TOE. 
ROCKET Tell me you guys have a refrigerator somewhere with a bunch of severed human toes. 
Yondu SUBTLY SHAKES HIS HEAD. 
ROCKET (CONT'D) Okay, then let's just agree to never discuss this. 
Yondu RIPS the Ravager patch off his jacket. 
YONDU The drawer you want to open. Has this symbol on it, okay? 
Groot takes it. He looks at Yondu and NODS. 
And then, slowly, HE PLACES IT ON TOP OF HIS HEAD. 
INT. BAR/QUADRANT FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE 
The hoard of Ravagers hear Taserface's voice. 
TASERFACE (O.S.) HE'S GOT IT! YONDU'S GOT THE DAMN FIN! 
RETCH GO! 
SERIES OF SHOTS - INT. ALL OVER THE SHIP - OUTER SPACE 
ALL OF THE RAVAGERS all over the ship, in a panic, LOAD THEIR WEAPONS and HEAD TOWARD THE CELL. 
INT. ECLECTOR HALLWAY - OUTER SPACE 
Yondu and Rocket and Groot COME AROUND THIS CORNER IN SLOW- MOTION, the three biggest badasses in the history of cinema. 
A HOARD OF RAVAGERS, led by Brahl, FILE IN at the end of the hallway. 
But Yondu WHISTLES and the ARROW TWISTS QUICKLY BACK AND FORTH, SLICING THROUGH EACH OF THEM. 
Yondu SLAMS through a door into - 
INT. ECLECTOR DOCKING BAY - OUTER SPACE 
Our heroes step onto a catwalk in this, the biggest space in the Eclector. There are catwalks throughout and dozens of docked M-ships. The SCURRILOUS RAVAGER sees them from above -- 
SCURRILOUS RAVAGER Down there! 
IN AN EXTREME WIDE ANGLE, we see the ARROW FLYING UP AND DOWN, BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS, CUTTING THROUGH ALL SORTS OF RAVAGERS, closer and further from CAMERA. 
We TRAVEL BEHIND YONDU AND ROCKET as BODIES FALL AROUND THEM IN SLOW-MOTION LIKE FIREWORKS. 
Groot looks up and sees RETCH looking down at him. 
RETCH FLEES in terror as Groot GROWS branches to pull himself up behind him. 
Groot HOWLS FURIOUSLY, TAKING CHASE. 
Retch YOWLS like a child as he frantically runs. 
But Groot GROWS HIS BRANCHES around RETCH's legs, TRIPPING HIM. 
BAM! He FALLS, face first to the floor. 
And, with a WAR CRY, Baby Groot FLINGS the sadistic Ravager off the edge towards the abyss below. 
As RETCH FALLS past Yondu and Rocket, Baby Groot DROPS back down onto Rocket's shoulder, and they push their way through the doorway - 
INT. ECLECTOR SECURITY DOCK - OUTER SPACE 
Yondu, Rocket, and Groot move into this area, where they look up at DOZENS OF SECURITY MONITORS encircling them showing Ravagers filing toward them from every part of the ship. 
Yondu WHISTLES as he watches the MONITORS - 
ON A MONITOR, the arrow FLIES out the wall. He whistles so that it strikes TWO RAVAGERS running towards them. 
It ZIPS out of that room and 
INT. DARK HALL - OUTER SPACE 
A HOARD of Ravagers come running down a hall. The ARROW ZIPS overhead, smashing out all the lights so that the hall is completely dark, except for the DIM RED LIGHT OF THE ARROW. 
And we can just make out the RED LIGHT smashing through the body of every Ravager there and then on into -- 
INT. SPACEPORT - OUTER SPACE 
A YELLING CROWD OF RAVAGERS come, hungry for war, when the arrow SHOOTS THROUGH THE CHAINS holding a giant spaceship in place over their heads. 
It FALLS, instantly CRUSHING them all, and then zips on -- 
INT. BAR - OUTER SPACE 
Gef the Ravager is drunkenly drinking a mug of beer, when the arrow zips past him and through the mug, SHATTERING it. 
As Gef looks at the shattered mug, confused, the arrow comes flying back, ripping through Gef himself, FLINGING him off the bar stool. 
INT. ECLECTOR SECURITY DOCK - OUTER SPACE 
Rocket also uses the MONITORS to pinpoint where their attackers are. He methodically SHOOTS THROUGH the walls, striking the Ravagers as they get closer. 
WIDE OVERHEAD SHOT, the CAMERA REVOLVES as hoards of Ravagers GET CLOSE to Yondu and Rocket but the arrow and gunshots ZIP THROUGH THE WALLS taking them all down, one by one, like Busby Berkely gone mad. 
Then Yondu stops, seeing something on one of the MONITORS. 
Taserface, clutching a big ass gun, is marching down the hall towards them. 
Yondu WHISTLES, loudly and angrily. 
INTERCUT - INT. ENGINE ROOM/SECURITY DOCK - OUTER SPACE 
Taserface sees THE ARROW COMING AROUND A CORNER TOWARDS HIM. 
Yondu WHISTLES again. 
The ARROW BURSTS INTO FLAMES. 
Taserface DODGES it. 
He turns to watch it go, CACKLING pridefully over his agility. 
But his smile quickly dissipates. 
The arrow PLUNGES into a giant tank - which EXPLODES, ENGULFING HIM. 
EXT. ECLECTOR - OUTER SPACE 
A huge portion of the giant spacecraft EXPLODES, leading to a domino effect of one part of the ship BURSTING after another. 
INT. ECLECTOR SECURITY DOCK - OUTER SPACE 
ROCKET is dumbfounded as he sees on the MONITORS the numerous EXPLOSIONS throughout the ship. 
ROCKET You maniac. The whole ship is gonna blow. 
INT. ECLECTOR SECURITY DOCK - OUTER SPACE 
QUILL (CONT'D) Drax thinks you're not a dancer. 
GAMORA If you ever tell anyone about this, I'll kill you. 
They look at each other. 
QUILL When are we going to do something about this... unspoken thing between us? 
GAMORA What unspoken thing? 
QUILL THIS CHEERS-SAM-AND-DIANE-GUY-AND- GIRL-ON-A-TV-SHOW-WHO-DIG-EACH- OTHER-BUT-NEVER-SAY-IT-'CAUSE-WHEN- THEY-DO-THE-RATINGS-WOULD-GO-DOWN sort of thing? 
GAMORA There is no unspoken thing between us. 
QUILL Well, that's a Catch-22. Because if you said there was, it would be spoken, and then you'd be a liar. So by saying there isn't, you're telling the truth, and admitting there is. 
GAMORA That's not -- 
Gamora PULLS AWAY. 
GAMORA (CONT'D) What we should be discussing right now is that something about this place doesn't feel right. 
QUILL What are you talking about? You were the one who wanted me to come here! 
Gamora moves into -- 
INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS - DAY 
GAMORA That girl, Mantis. She's afraid of something. 
Quill follows her.   He stops, staring at her, hurt and frustrated. 
QUILL Why are you trying to take this from me? 
GAMORA I'm not -- 
QUILL He's my father. He's blood - 
GAMORA You have blood on earth. You never wanted to return there. 
QUILL Again - you made me come here! And Earth?! Earth is the place my mother died in front of me. 
GAMORA No, it's because that's real, and this is a fantasy. 
QUILL This is real. I'm only half human, remember? 
GAMORA That's the half I'm worried about. 
QUILL Oh, I get it. You're jealous because I'm part god! You like me being the weak one! 
Gamora adds some pieces to her transmitter. 
GAMORA Uh. You were insufferable to begin with. I haven't been able to reach Rocket. I'm going to see if I can get a signal outside. 
QUILL You know, this isn't Cheers after all. It's whatever the show is where one person is willing to, you know, open themselves up to new possibilities, and the other person is just kind of a jerk who doesn't trust anyone! It's a show that doesn't exist - it would never be made, it would be so horrible! It would get zero ratings! 
GAMORA You're having a conversation with yourself! I don't know what Cheers is! 
QUILL I finally found my family, don't you understand that!? 
GAMORA I thought you already had. 
QUILL So this is how it ends, then? Our whole story. Like this? You and me? 
GAMORA Get it through your head, Peter. There is no you and me. There never was. 
Quill watches her leave. 
EXT. EGO'S FIELDS - SUNSET 
Gamora sits, alone in the fields, pouting, fuming.   She stops, staring angrily inward. 
Two plants, nearby, flitter against one another in the wind, making a CLICKING sound. She side-eyes them. They don't stop. 
She slices them off with her sword. 
GAMORA Dammit. 
Gamora hears something. She turns to see, in the distance, an M-ship flying toward the planet. 
She watches as it gets closer and closer, and realizes it is FLYING DIRECTLY AT HER. 
Gamora RUNS. 
INT. NEBULA'S SHIP - SUNSET 
Nebula HOLLERS as she BLASTS HER GUNS, DIVING towards Gamora. 
EXT. HILLSIDE - SUNSET 
Gamora FLEES from Nebula's ship like Cary Grant from the crop duster in North by Northwest as HUGE CHUNKS OF LAND EXPLODE on either side of her. 
Gamora leaps into a DITCH, LANDING HARD, as the M-Ship SWOOPS just a couple feet above her. 
GAMORA You psychopath. 
Gamora sees the M-Ship banking and FLYING BACK at her again. 
She stands and runs along the hillside as GUN BLASTS burst behind her. But Gamora sees a CAVERN, leading down into the earth. 
She DARTS into it. 
INT. EGO'S CAVERN - FIRST/SECOND LEVELS - SUNSET 
As Gamora RUNS down the cavern, she glances back over her shoulder where Nebula, insane with rage, continues FLYING towards her -- 
The M-SHIP ENTERS THE CAVERN, which is too small for it, CLIPPING ITS WINGS - but it keeps flying. It again BLASTS at Gamora as she FLEES - 
The BLASTS cause the ground to COLLAPSE around Gamora, and she FALLS, SMASHING DOWN THROUGH ONE LEVEL, to another level below, SLAMMING HARD on the ground. 
The underside of the M-ship gets SCRAPED APART as it flies above her, and pieces of it come RAINING DOWN around her. 
Nebula ZOOMS towards a huge cavern wall.   She tries to turn her ship in time, to no avail. 
She SIDESWIPES it, falling down, CRASHING on the ground, where she is now on the same level as Gamora. 
QUILL Well, you might not be mortal, but ME - 
EGO Death will remain a stranger to both of us as long as the light burns within the planet. 
Ego smiles. 
QUILL I'm immortal? That's... really? 
EGO Yes, as long as the light exists. 
QUILL And I can use the light to make cool things? Like how you made all this? 
EGO It'll take thousands of years of practice before you get really good at it . But, yes. 
QUILL Well, get ready for an eight hundred foot statue of Pac Man, then. With Skeletor. And Heather Locklear. I'm gonna make some weird shit. 
Ego puts his arm around him, smiles kindly. 
EGO I can't wait to see your weird shit. 
QUILL Wow, that... 
EGO Came out a little disgusting. 
They CHUCKLE. 
EGO (CONT'D) It is a tremendous responsibility, Peter. Only we can remake the universe. Only we can take the bridle of the cosmos and lead it where it needs to go. 
QUILL How? 
Ego holds up his fingers, letting forth a flame of white cosmic light. Quill holds up his fingers, letting forth a smaller, less intense flame of white cosmic light. 
REVEAL MANTIS, IN THE HALL, around the corner, looking at Ego and Quill and the light emanating from their fingers. 
EGO Come with me. 
Mantis looks like she's having a panic attack. 
INT. DRAX'S SLEEPING QUARTERS - MOMENTS LATER 
CLOSE-UP OF DRAX, sound asleep. 
MANTIS (O.S.) Drax! Drax! 
He WAKES to see a panicked Mantis sitting on the bed beside him. 
MANTIS (CONT'D) Drax, we need to talk - 
DRAX Ugh. I am sorry, but I like a woman with some meat on her bones. 
MANTIS What? 
DRAX I tried to let you down easily by telling you I found you disgusting. 
MANTIS No! That's not what I - 
Drax starts to GAG. 
MANTIS (CONT'D) What are you doing?! 
DRAX I'm imagining being with you physically! 
MANTIS Drax, that's not - I don't like you like that. I don't even like the type of thing you are. 
DRAX (OFFENDED) Hey! There's no need to get personal! 
MANTIS Listen! Ego's gotten exactly what he wanted. I should have told you earlier, I am stupid. You are in danger. 
EXT. NEBULA'S SQUASHED M-SHIP - NIGHT 
Gamora and Nebula still sit here, quietly and awkwardly. Gamora glances down a twisting tunnel, where phosphorescent lights shine brightly. 
GAMORA What's that? 
She moves towards it.   Nebula, hesitantly, follows. 
INT. PALACE - NIGHT 
Ego and Quill enter the palace. 
EGO You need to readjust the way you process life. Everything around us - including the girl - is temporary. We are forever. 
QUILL Doesn't eternity get boring? 
EGO Not if you have a purpose, Peter. Which is why you're here. I told you how all those years ago I had an unceasing impulse to find life. 
Ego is standing underneath the diorama of him facing the little alien girl. 
EGO (CONT'D) I didn't tell you how when I did find it, it was all so... disappointing. 
INT. TWISTING CAVERNS - NIGHT 
Gamora and Nebula move further down the cavern, stepping into light, getting closer. 
EGO And that is when I came to a profound realization. 
INT. PALACE - NIGHT 
EGO My innate desire to seek out other life was not so that I could walk among that life. 
Ego looks at his son, moved by the memories. 
EGO (CONT'D) Peter, I had found meaning. 
Quill is taken aback. But Ego sets his finger lightly on his forehead, and the white light bursts through his son's body. 
We see THE COSMOS IN QUILL'S EYES. He looks ecstatic, far beyond where he stands, and seems to finally understand. 
QUILL I see it. Eternity. 
INT. TWISTING CAVERNS - NIGHT 
Gamora and Nebula stop, in horror. 
GAMORA Oh my God. 
MANTIS The bodies are his children. 
Gamora is horrified. 
INT. PALACE - NIGHT 
On the DIORAMAS we see Ego with hundreds of species of female aliens. 
EGO Out of all my labors the most beguiling was attempting to graft my DNA with that of another species. I hoped the result of such a coupling would be enough to power the expansion. 
INT. ECLECTOR HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Yondu and Rocket walk here. 
EGO (O.S.) I had Yondu deliver some of them to me. It broke the Ravager code - but I compensated him generously. And, to ease his conscience, I told him I would never hurt them. 
INT. PALACE - NIGHT 
EGO That was true. They never felt a thing. But, one after the other, they failed me. None of them had the Celestial genes. Until you, Peter. Out of all my spawn, only you have carried the connection to the light. 
Peter smiles, an enchanted idiot, the cosmos in his eyes. 
INT. DRAX'S SLEEPING QUARTERS - NIGHT 
GAMORA We need to find Peter now and get off this damn planet. 
MANTIS Ego will have won him to his side by now. He has a way of - 
NEBULA Then we just go. 
GAMORA No. He's our friend. 
NEBULA All any of you do is yell at each other. You're not friends. 
DRAX You're right. We're family. We leave no one behind. (TO NEBULA) Except maybe you. 
NEBULA Oh my god. 
INT. PALACE - NIGHT 
EGO For the first time in my life, I am truly not alone. 
Quill suddenly looks sad. 
EGO (CONT'D) What is it, son? 
QUILL My friends. 
EGO That's the mortal in you, Peter. 
QUILL Yes. I don't need that. 
EGO What are we? 
QUILL Forever. 
EGO What are they? 
QUILL Temporary. 
EGO You think you love them. But love is merely an evolutionary trick in the service of reproduction. We are beyond such things. 
QUILL Yes. 
EGO NOW - 
QUILL But my mother. 
Ego looks at him, questioningly. 
QUILL (CONT'D) You said you loved my mother. 
EGO That I did. My river lily, who knew the words to every song that came on the radio. I returned to earth to see her three times. I knew if I came back a fourth, I'd never leave. (MORE) 
EGO (CONT'D) The expansion, the reason for my very existence would be over. So I did what I had to do. But it broke my heart to put that tumor in her head. 
QUILL Wh- what? 
ZOLLY IN ON QUILL as the cosmos disappear from his eyes. Tears stream down his face. 
EGO I know that sounds bad - 
QUILL PULLS OUT HIS PISTOLS AND FIRES; THE BLAST TEARS THROUGH EGO, DISPERSING the MOLECULES forming his body. 
Quill SHOOTS at him AGAIN and AGAIN and AGAIN. The flesh disappears from Ego like bites from a cookie, exposing the angry alien skeletal form beneath. 
But, as the charge on Peter's blasters wears out, Ego just looks at him, and, although he's filled with holes, he's merely disappointed. 
EGO (CONT'D) Who in the hell do you think you are? 
QUILL You killed my mother! 
EGO TRANSFORMS into DAVID HASSELHOFF. 
EGO I tried so hard to find the form that best suited you, and this is the thanks I get? 
And then, once again, BECOMES HIS USUAL FORM. 
EGO (CONT'D) You really need to grow up. 
A SPIKY COSMIC LIGHT-PROPELLED TENDRIL SHOOTS UP from the floor behind Quill, and JUTS into Quill's body. 
Quill is THRUST INTO THE AIR.   He opens his mouth to SCREAM and WHITE LIGHT EMITS. 
EGO (CONT'D) I wanted to do this together! But I suppose you'll have to learn by spending the next thousand years as a battery, `Star-Lord'. 
INT. DRAX'S SLEEPING QUARTERS - NIGHT 
THROUGH THE WINDOW to the PALACE - PAN TO Gamora watching as her TRANSMITTER - the one she was trying to contact Rocket on - BEEPS. She answers. 
GAMORA Rocket?! 
Gamora follows Drax, Nebula, and a confused Mantis as they move out. 
INT. LASER DRILL - OUTER SPACE 
DRAX What are you doing? You could have killed us all crashing in here like that! 
ROCKET Uh, `Thank you, Rocket'? 
DRAX We had it under control. 
MANTIS We did not. That is only an extension of his true self. He will be back soon. 
QUILL (RE: NEBULA) What's Smurfette doing here!? 
NEBULA Back rubs, dishes, killing gods, whatever I need to do to get a damn ride home. 
ROCKET She tried to murder me! 
NEBULA I saved you, you stupid fox. 
GAMORA He's not a fox. 
GROOT I am Groot. 
ROCKET I'm not a raboon either! 
GROOT I am Groot. 
ROCKET `Raccoon,' whatever! 
Drax looks out the window. 
INT. PALACE - NIGHT 
TENTACLE-LIKE STRANDS BURST UP through the palace flooring all around the drill. 
INT. PALACE - NIGHT 
Drax turns to the others. 
DRAX How do we kill a Celestial? 
QUILL There's the center to him - his brain, his soul, whatever it is, in some sort of shell -- 
MANTIS It's in the caverns below the surface. 
Quill climbs up the ladder to see - 
QUILL YONDU? 
Nebula looks at Gamora. 
NEBULA If he's got that fin back, I am so screwed. 
I/E. PALACE - SUNRISE 
Yondu THRUSTS the ship upward for takeoff.   But TENTACLES wrap around the ship -- 
And YANK IT BACK DOWN into the floor, destroying the foundation of the palce. 
THE ENTIRE PALACE SLOPES. 
INT. LASER DRILL - SUNRISE 
Everyone FALLS forward. 
YONDU Thrusters are out! 
Quill starts rewiring the mechanics. 
QUILL I guess I should be glad I was a skinny kid. Otherwise you would have delivered me to this maniac! 
YONDU You still reckon that's the reason I kept you around, you idiot?! 
QUILL That's what you told me, you old doofus! 
YONDU Once I figured out what happened to them other kids, I wasn't gonna just hand you over. 
QUILL You said you were gonna eat me! 
YONDU That was being funny! 
QUILL Not to me!! 
ROCKET You people have issues. 
Quill sees THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD where EGO'S CREEPY SKELETAL is GROWING IN FRONT OF THEM. 
QUILL Of course I have issues that's my fricking father!!... Thrusters are back up. 
Quill thrusts the ship FORWARD instead of up. 
It CRASHES through Ego and DOWN THE SLOPING FLOOR -- 
And OUT THROUGH the giant pane of glass at the end. 
I/E. LASER DRILL/CRACK IN THE PLANET - SUNRISE 
Everyone holds on in what's essentially the worst roller coaster drop ever. 
YONDU We should be going up! 
QUILL We can't. Ego wants to eradicate the universe as we know it. We have to kill him. 
They PLUMMET toward a fissure in the earth below.   It's too small for the ship. 
QUILL (CONT'D) Rocket! 
ROCKET Got it. 
Rocket BLASTS the lasers perfectly, CHIPPING AWAY PIECES of rock, forming an opening in the crack. 
They SMASH into the opening, barely fitting, leading down into the planet. 
Quill flies perfectly, TWISTING through tunnels and around corners. 
Rocket mans the lasers, BLASTING PIECES OUT OF PLACE just in time so they can SCRAPE through. 
ROCKET (CONT'D) So, we're saving the galaxy again? 
QUILL We drill into the center, we kill him. 
Quill holds tight to the steering wheel. Yondu notices the BLINKING LIGHT on the comm. He taps it. 
YONDU What is it, Kraglin? 
KRAGLIN (O.S.) Um, remember that Ayesha chick? 
YONDU Yeah, why? 
Yondu looks out the window where AYESHA'S SQUADRON is SWOOPING OUT OF the cracks in the ceiling all around them. 
YONDU (CONT'D) Aw, hell. 
Quill PULLS AWAY from the envoys. 
But the Sovereign envoys start BLASTING AT THE CRAFT all at once; the LASER LOSES POWER and the VEHICLE TURNS SIDEWAYS - 
Drax, Mantis, and Gamora GO TUMBLING from the hole in the side. Nebula and Groot grab onto the floor. 
INT. BELOW SELF CHAMBER - DAY 
Gamora, Drax, and Mantis FALL from an incredible height. They LAND - ONE, TWO, THREE - WITH APLOMB. 
Gamora looks up and sees the Laser Drill CURL behind the Self Chamber as it tries to avoid the envoys' BLASTERS. 
INT. SELF CHAMBER/LASER DRILL - DAY 
Nebula and Groot settle as the ship rights itself and BLASTS PIERCE the ship around them. 
Quill peers down at Rocket, who has jumped out of his seat and is pouring out the contents of his satchel. 
QUILL Why aren't you firing the laser?! 
ROCKET They blew out the generator! I think I packed a small detonator. 
NEBULA A detonator is worthless without explosives! 
ROCKET We got these! 
Rocket shows Nebula the Anulax batteries. 
Quill leaves the controls to Yondu as he CLIMBS down beside Rocket, now messing with wiring on his BOMB. 
QUILL Is it strong enough to kill Ego? 
ROCKET If it is, it will cause a chain reaction throughout his entire nervous system. 
QUILL Meaning what? 
ROCKET The entire planet will explode. We'll have to get out of here fast. I rigged a timer. 
Rocket stuffs the bomb back in his satchel.   Groot climbs on his back. 
Rocket and Quill slap on their AERO RIGS. 
QUILL Go! 
The run and jump out of the laser drill, FLYING ON THEIR AERO RIGS, avoiding the GUNFIRE. 
The ZOOM towards the blast hole on the side of the self chamber. 
INT. OPENING OF BLAST HOLE - DAY 
Rocket and Quill land here, messily, TUMBLING. 
INT. BELOW SELF CHAMBER - DAY 
Mantis is worried about something else entirely; the entire chasm begins TREMBLING and the walls start to MUTATE. 
MANTIS He's coming. 
DRAX Didn't you say you could make him sleep? 
MANTIS When he wants! He's too powerful! I can't! 
DRAX You don't have to believe in yourself because I believe in you. 
They look ahead. They see, on the enormous wall in front of them, the LIGHT-FORM of a giant EGO SCREAMING ANGRILY. 
His SCREAM becomes a TUNNEL OF ROCKS RUSHING TOWARDS THEM like a train. 
Mantis sees a nerve bundle on the ground coming from Ego's Core. Although afraid, she grabs it. 
MANTIS SLEEP! 
She SCREAMS with effort and some pain as energy travels through the bundle and into the core, where it darkens. 
The LIGHT LEAVES THE ROCK FORMATION and it SLAMS into the ground in front of them, SPLASHING DIRT OVER THEM. 
But they are safe, shivering. Drax and Gamora look at each other. 
DRAX I never thought she'd be able to do it. With as skinny and weak as she appears to be. 
Mantis's arm is TREMBLING. 
MANTIS I don't know how long I can hold him! 
GAMORA You need to, girl. If you don't keep Ego at bay, we all die. 
INT. OPENING OF BLAST HOLE - DAY 
Rocket shines a powerful PEN-LIGHT inside the cavity, exposing the interior, spattered with Swiss-cheese-like holes glowing with light. 
ROCKET The metal is too thick! For the bomb to work we'd actually need to place it on Ego's core. And our fat butts ain't gonna fit through those tiny holes. 
QUILL Well... 
Quill slowly eyes Groot, who is playing with a leaf on his arm and thinking about something else entirely. 
ROCKET That's a terrible idea. 
QUILL Which is the only kind of idea we got left. 
Rocket SIGHS. He puts Groot on his back and MOVES with Groot deeper into the blast hole, mumbling to himself: 
Yondu flips ALL the switches; ALL THE POWER RUNS PAINFULLY OUT OF NEBULA'S BODY INTO THE VEHICLE -- 
AND THE LASERS BEAM OUT OF THE SHIP IN ALL DIRECTIONS AT ONCE, like a dangerous disco ball, slicing through almost nearly every single ENVOY. 
INT. BELOW SELF CHAMBER - DAY 
A BEAM ALMOST HITS Drax, but he LEAPS out of the way. Smoke rises from a hole in the ground between him and Mantis. 
DRAX Hey! 
INT. PLANET'S HOLLOW/LASER DRILL - DAY 
With flair, Yondu spins the pilot's wheel, so that the whole rig REVOLVES. 
Ayesha looks on, in horror as the BEAMS SLICE THROUGH the remaining CRAFT - and one is COMING HER WAY. 
AYESHA (ON SHIP) NO!! 
AYESHA'S ENVOY IS RIPPED APART. 
INT. SOVEREIGN PILOT BAY - DAY 
Ayesha SITS BACK. She looks around her at the other pods: all of them are down. 
AYESHA NO! NOOOOO!! 
INT. PLANET'S HOLLOW/LASER DRILL - DAY 
Quill sees FLAMING CHUNKS FLY into the rig... 
And FIRE SPILLING toward the ship's engine, dripping fuel. 
QUILL We're gonna blow! 
Yondu WHISTLES as the FLAMES HIT THE FUEL - 
INT. BELOW SELF CHAMBER - DAY 
Gamora watches as the ENTIRE LASER DRILL EXPLODES.   She is stricken. 
GAMORA Peter? 
She sees a tiny body flying from the ship - it's Nebula, who LANDS across from her on her feet. 
Gamora looks at her, worried. Nebula gives her what might be a little smile, and looks upward. Gamora follows her line of sight. 
Quill is FLYING FROM THE EXPLOSION on his aero-rig. Yondu is holding onto a flying arrow: his one arm up straight, his heels touching. Quill looks at him and SNICKERS. 
YONDU What? 
QUILL You look like Mary Poppins. 
YONDU Is he cool? 
Quill looks at the man who raised him. He smiles. 
QUILL Yeah. He's cool. 
Yondu looks out at the Guardians as he comes in for a landing. 
YONDU I'm Mary Poppins, y'all! 
Quill and Yondu LAND beside Nebula. Gamora sees Quill and MARCHES TOWARD HIM. 
The CAMERA CIRCLES GAMORA AND QUILL, FIERY SHIP FRAGMENTS RAINING DOWN AROUND THEM IN SLOW-MOTION, as if this is the greatest heavy metal video of all time. 
The other Guardians enter, one by one - Nebula, Drax, Yondu, Rocket FLYING DOWN on his aero-rig, and finally, Mantis, staring forward with concentration until -- 
A HUGE CHUNK OF SPACESHIP FLIES IN FROM THE SIDE, FLATTENING MANTIS. The others all look down at her in shock. 
QUILL Oh. Wow. 
Mantis, UNCONSCIOUS BENEATH a ship fragment, has lost hold of Ego. 
THE ENTIRE HOLLOW AROUND THEM BEGINS TO RUMBLE.   THE GROUND AND WALLS THEMSELVES SHIFT and WAVER. 
The whole cavity is alive. Drax checks on Mantis. 
DRAX She's just unconscious. 
INT. SELF CHAMBER TUNNELS - DAY 
Groot RUNS and HOPS through the tunnels. He comes to a crossroads. 
He sees a COSMIC LIGHT emanating from one tunnel.   He dashes off toward it. 
INT. BELOW SELF CHAMBER - DAY 
QUILL How long before the bomb goes off? 
ROCKET In the unlikely event Groot doesn't kill us all, about six minutes. 
Yondu speaks into the comm on his lapel. 
YONDU Kraglin. 
INT. QUADRANT FLIGHT DECK - DAY 
Kraglin, NODDING OUT, abruptly wakes. 
YONDU (O.S.) We need the Quadrant for extraction in T-minus five minutes. 
KRAGLIN Aye, Cap'n! 
EXT. BELOW SELF CHAMBER - DAY 
Our heroes peer up to see the SURFACE OF THE PLANET UNFOLDING ABOVE THEM, so that THE BRIGHT SKY SHINES THROUGH. 
QUILL Someone needs to be up top when Kraglin arrives. Drax, take Mantis. 
Drax nods. He picks up Mantis. Quill grabs the aero-rig off himself and SLAPS it on Drax's back, which AUTOMATICALLY WRAPS around his upper body. 
DRAX Ahhh! My nipples! 
He FLIES UPWARD. 
And once again, the LIGHT TENDRILS STAB THROUGH QUILL'S BACK, thrusting him to his knees. 
Smaller light tendrils stab into his face and body. 
And we see the LIGHT being sucked out of Quill and up into the Self Chamber once more as it BURSTS WITH LIGHT. 
EARTH - EXT. STREET - DAY 
POLICE OFFICERS and bystanders are in the streets, snapping phone photos, etc, beside the HUGE, STILL SWATCH OF EGO'S LIFEFORM. 
OFFICER FITZGIBBON Please, everyone. Step back. I need you all to clear the - 
WEIRD OLD MAN What is that? 
The LIFEFORM ALIGHTS WITH ENERGY and MOVES again, SPILLING INCREDIBLY QUICKLY towards them. 
People abandon their cars in traffic as it RUNS OVER THEM. 
A WOMAN FALLS. People TRAMPLE around her. 
But an old man's hands reach in, helping her up. 
REVEAL GRANDPA QUILL, in his 70's or 80's now. 
GRANDPA QUILL Come on, ma'am. 
He HELPS the woman into an SUV. 
He SLAMS on the gas, SCREECHING AWAY from the enormous tidal wave of organic light. 
XANDAR - I/E. STARBLASTER/CITY - DAY 
EGO'S LIFEFORM smashes down the PARK WALLS and into the street. 
EGO (O.S) It doesn't need to be like this PETER 
EXT. BELOW SELF CHAMBER - DAY 
Ego approaches his son. 
EGO Why are you destroying our chance?! 
AAKON - EXT. AAKON CITY - NIGHT 
AAKONS run from a giant wave behind them. 
EGO (O.S) Stop pretending you aren't, what you are! 
KREE HOMEWORLD - EXT. STEEP HILLSIDE - DAY 
KREE MONKS run from the cosmic flesh as it pours down the hillside behind them. 
But it's too fast, RUSHING OVER THEM. 
PRIMITIVE PLANET - EXT. WETLANDS - DAY 
THOUSANDS OF ORLONI are darting in fear across this dusty desert, as it WASHES OVER them. 
EGO (O.S) One in billions.. 
ARAGO-7 - EXT. STONY LANDSCAPE - DAY 
THREE HURCTARIANS run, SCREAMING. 
EGO (O.S) Trillions, even more! 
EASIK - EXT. FOREST - NIGHT 
AN EASIK MOTHER clutches her BABY, covering it with her own body, as the spreading lifeform LOOMS UP behind her. 
She closes her eyes and waits for the worst. 
EXT. BELOW SELF CHAMBER - DAY 
Quill looks up at Ego, barely able to focus, as the molecules form skin over the muscle and skeleton and innards beneath. 
EGO What greater meaning could life possibly have to offer?! 
Yondu struggles beneath the tentacle beside Quill. 
YONDU I don't use my head to fly the arrow, boy! I use my h - 
Quill hears this as the earth COVERS Yondu's face. 
Quill LOOKS INWARD. And suddenly, everything becomes... 
QUIET. 
Tears come to Peter Quill's eyes as he remember those around him and what they mean to him. And we see his MEMORIES. 
- YOUNG PETER QUILL AND HIS MOTHER CUDDLED AND LISTENING TO MUSIC ON THE WALKMAN TOGETHER, EACH WITH ONE EAR PIECE. 
- QUILL AND DRAX LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY ON THE MILANO. 
- GAMORA AND PETER LOOKING INTO EACH OTHER'S EYES AND DANCING ON KNOWHERE. 
- QUILL AND ROCKET FLYING THROUGH THE SKY ON AERO-RIGS FOR THE FIRST TIME, SMILING AS THE AIR RUSHES THROUGH THEIR HAIR. BABY GROOT CLUTCHES HAPPILY ONTO QUILL'S BACK. 
- YONDU AND YOUNG QUILL IN THE FOREST. YONDU'S ARM IS ON PETER'S ARM AS HE TEACHES HIM HOW TO SHOOT. 
Quill looks back up at Ego as we HEAR the gentle chords of FLEETWOOD MAC'S "THE CHAIN" starts echoing throughout the hollow. 
He clutches his fist and we see the light growing within it. 
Bits of earth begin to ROLL UP AND SCRAMBLE AND SWIRL around Quill's body, his arms, his legs, as if he's pulling them towards himself with magnets. 
And Ego looks confused, as the GROUND QUAKES AROUND HIM. 
Quill glares at his father, his voice distorting with Celestial thunder. 
QUILL You shouldn't have killed my mom and squished my walkman. 
Ahd a SOLID TORNADO OF EARTH PROPELS QUILL FORWARD. Ego tries to protect himself as Quill SLAMS into him, FLYING UPWARDS WITH HIM -- 
Quill raises his fist, NOW A GIANT CLUB.   And he SMASHES Ego. 
EXT. BELOW SELF CHAMBER/PLANET'S HOLLOW - DAY 
Ego SLAMS Quill back against a wall. Ego pulls the huge rocks away from the wall, FLYING THEM TOWARDS HIM and BATTERING HIM THERE. 
Ego and Quill FLY TOWARDS each other. 
Ego uses the LIGHT TO BRING ROCKS TO HIS BODY, forming a giant AVATAR OF HIMSELF. 
Quill brings YELLOW ROCKS to his body, forming a GIANT PAC- MAN. 
Ego's form flies into Pac-Man's mouth, so hard there's a SONIC BOOM. 
They fall, TUMBLING, still striking one another on the way down. 
They LAND HARD. 
INT. SELF CHAMBER CORE - DAY 
The timer counts down.    A minute left. 
I/E. PLANET SURFACE/QUADRANT LOADING BAY - DAY 
Gamora and Nebula are caring for Mantis as Rocket and Groot ARRIVE. 
GAMORA Where's Peter? 
Rocket doesn't answer. Or he can't answer. 
GAMORA (CONT'D) Rocket, where is he?! 
Rocket looks down at a timer in his hand. The time is almost there. 
GAMORA (CONT'D) Rocket?! Rocket, look at me! Where is he?! 
Rocket just shakes his head a little. 
But Groot points sadly outside. 
GAMORA (CONT'D) I'm not leaving without him. 
Gamora hardens. She stands and SNATCHES A RIFLE off the wall. She COCKS IT. 
She STARTS OUT the bay door -- 
When AN ELECTRICAL BLAST HITS HER from behind. 
She FALLS OVER, unconscious, REVEALING Rocket with his gun. 
ROCKET I'm sorry. I can only afford to lose one friend today. (INTO COMM) Kraglin, GO! 
INT. QUADRANT FLIGHT DECK - DAY 
Drax looks uncertain as Kraglin presses thrust. 
DRAX Wait. Is Quill back? (INTO COMM) Rocket, where's Quill?! 
I/E. PLANET SURFACE/QUADRANT LOADING BAY - DAY 
Rocket looks sadly out the bay door as it CLOSES; Drax's voice echoes on his comm. 
DRAX (O.S.) 251             Where's Quill?! WHERE'S QUILL?!                   251 
EXT. BELOW SELF CHAMBER - DAY 
Quill and Ego are exhausted, on their knees and leaning against one another like boxers after too many rounds. 
INT. SELF CHAMBER CORE - DAY 
The timer reads 00:26 seconds 
EXT. BELOW SELF CHAMBER - DAY 
Ego reaches for the core.. 
EGO No, we need to stop it! 
Quill throws him to the ground. But Ego comes back up, grasping his son's jacket, pleading with him now. 
EGO (CONT'D) Listen to me! You are a god! If you kill me, you'll just be like everyone else! 
QUILL What's so wrong with that? 
Ego looks at his son, scared. 
EGO NO - 
INT. SELF CHAMBER CORE - DAY 
The countdown reaches zero.    The brain EXPLODES. 
I/E. EGO'S NERVOUS SYSTEM - DAY 
The explosion causes the life forces to BURST THROUGH THE ENTIRE PLANET. 
EXT. BELOW SELF CHAMBER - DAY 
Everything around Quill is EXPLODING. 
He looks down at his hands, where the glow FADES and DISAPPEARS. 
He gazes up at the mammoth walls around him as they BLOW UP and COLLAPSE. 
He lowers at head, at peace with the death that's coming, when, from the side, through the debris -- 
YONDU IS FLYING TOWARDS HIM ON AN AERO-RIG. 
Yondu GRABS him, almost a tackle, really, LIFTING HIM up and FLYING AWAY. 
EXT. PLANET'S HOLLOW - DAY 
As Yondu and Quill FLY UPWARD, the planet EXPLODES behind them, flames licking their heels, huge stretches of the planet caving in. 
EXT. SKY - DAY 
Yondu holds a surprised Quill as they SOAR up into the sky, 
KRAGLIN (CONT'D) It's called a Zune - what everyone listens to on earth nowadays. It's got three hundred songs. 
Quill nods, touched. 
QUILL Wait. 
Quill holds out Yondu's arrow.   Kraglin's lip trembles. 
QUILL (CONT'D) Rocket grabbed the pieces and reassembled them. I think Yondu would want you to have it. 
KRAGLIN Thank you... Cap'n. 
EXT. QUADRANT - OUTER SPACE 
Yondu's SPARKLING ASHES ARE BLOWN OUT IN SPURTS FROM THE CREMATORY INTO SPACE. 
INT. QUADRANT FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE 
Rocket, Drax, and Mantis are here, watching Yondu's ashes in the vacuum of space, SWIRLING almost magically. 
INT. CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - OUTER SPACE 
Quill sits down on the bed in Yondu's quarters.   He scrolls through selections on the Zune. 
He comes to "FATHER AND SON" by CAT STEVENS. 
He PRESSES PLAY. 
He listens. As he does, Groot crawls up onto the bed, and then onto his lap. 
Quill offers him one of the ear buds. 
Groot holds it against his ear, amazed by the clarity of sound. Quill watches him, hearing the beauty of the song more through Groot's face than the music itself. 
And they sit there together, listening to the music, a new father and son. 
INT. M-SHIP - OUTER SPACE 
Nebula FLIES AWAY, sad, perhaps regretful, but forcing her chin up to brace against what's to come. 
INT. QUADRANT SMALL HALLWAY - OUTER SPACE 
Gamora watches, THROUGH A WINDOW, as Nebula leaves. 
INT. QUADRANT FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE 
Rocket sees something by the ashes.   His eyes alight. 
ROCKET They came. 
INT. CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - OUTER SPACE 
Groot sees COLORFUL FLASHING LIGHTS out of the window.   He pulls on Quill's shirt to show him. 
They go to get a better view. 
INT. QUADRANT FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE 
Drax and Rocket see Yondu's COSMIC ASHES PULSING AND SWIRLING out in space as, one by one, enormous RAVAGER SHIPS arrive around them. 
They each FLASH SPECIFIC LIGHT SEQUENCES - and, with all the ships together - it looks like fireworks. 
DRAX What is it? 
ROCKET I sent word to Yondu's old Ravager buddies and told them what he did. 
Quill comes up behind them with Groot, just as Gamora enters. Quill smiles. 
QUILL It's a Ravager funeral. 
INT. HALLWAY - OUTER SPACE 
Kraglin sees it from here. He SCREAMS with joy, and he slams his fist twice against his chest, a Ravager salute. 
I/E. RAVAGER FLIGHT DECK 1 - OUTER SPACE 
STAKAR and Martinex watch him there, moved. 
MARTINEX He didn't let us down after all, Cap'n. 
STAKAR No, he did not, son. He did not. 
I/E. RAVAGER FLIGHT DECK 2 - OUTER SPACE 
CHARLIE-27, an enormous man, is wistful as he salutes. 
CHARLIE-27 Fare thee well, old friend. 
I/E. RAVAGER FLIGHT DECK 3 - OUTER SPACE 
ALETA is here, tears in her eyes, alcohol in her hand, an ALL- FEMALE RAVAGER CREW around her. 
ALETA See you in the stars, Yondu Udonta. 
INT. QUADRANT FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE 
And the Guardians all watch, enchanted by the majesty. 
ROCKET He didn't chase `em away. 
QUILL No. 
ROCKET Even though he yelled at `em. 
Quill shakes his head. 
ROCKET (CONT'D) And was always mean. 
Quill shakes his head. 
ROCKET (CONT'D) And he stole batteries he didn't need. 
Quill is surprised - what? And then he looks at Rocket, a little animal who doesn't know the rules of how to be any more than a young boy whose tribe sold him into slavery. 
QUILL Of course not.

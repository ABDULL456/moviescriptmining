EXT. OPEN SEA - DAY 
Hiccup and Toothless BLUR PAST, leaving a wake that leads... 
EXT. BERK - DAY 
(Sequence 0200 - New Berk) To the island village of Berk, festively adorned with flags and banners. Major new additions alter its familiar skyline. 
HICCUP (V.O.) This... is Berk. The best kept secret this side of, well, anywhere. Granted, it may not look like much, but this wet heap of rock packs more than a few surprises. 
ON A CLUSTER OF SHEEP, hiding nervously between buildings as shadows of passing dragons race by. The group moves as one, receding into a shadowy alley, pushing one sheep out into the light. It's suddenly snatched and carried into the air! 
HICCUP (V.O.) Life here is amazing, just not for the faint of heart. See, where most folks enjoy hobbies like whittling or needlepoint, we Berkians prefer a little something we like to call-- 
WHOOSH, WHOOSH, WHOOSH! A wash of VIBRANT COLORS blurs by. DRAGONS BARREL PAST at a dizzying speed. Their RIDERS SWIPE, KICK, and ROLL into one another while they WEAVE neck in neck between the houses, docks, and revamped structures of Berk. 
HICCUP (V.O.) 
DRAGON RACING! 
It's like an aerial version of the Monte Carlo race. Spectators ROAR from wooden bleachers, fastened to cliff faces and perched over the sea. 
FISHLEGS, now 20 and even larger, rides his gronkle, MEATLUG, who carries the sheep in her claws, until... 
SNOTLOUT, also 20, but every bit as juvenile, and his Monstrous Nightmare, HOOKFANG, steal the sheep from them. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 2. 
SNOTLOUT Oh, I'm sorry, Fishlegs! Did you want that? 
FISHLEGS Snotlout! That's mine! Snotlout FALLS BACK toward RUFFNUT and TUFFNUT, who lag on their two-headed Zippleback, BARF & BELCH. 
SNOTLOUT Here ya go, babe. With a chivalrous grin, Snotlout tosses the sheep to Ruffnut. She SNATCHES it with a sneer and a GRUMBLE. 
SNOTLOUT (CONT'D) Did I tell you that you look amazing today? `Cause you do. 
RUFFNUT Come on, Barf. It's starting to stink around here. Barf starts to peel off, spewing gas. Tuffnut mocks Snotlout with a mugging grin. 
TUFFNUT Nope. Still hates you. Let's blow this place, Belch! Belch ignites the gas, sparking a flashy explosion, and leaving Snotlout behind in the smoke. As they rush past the main bleachers, Ruffnut DROPS her sheep into one of five baskets suspended over a chasm at the lap crossing. Each backboard bears an image of its corresponding dragon. The Barf/Belch basket filled to the brim with sheep. Presiding over the game, STOICK turns to the frenzied crowd. 
STOICK That's nine for the Twins, Astrid lags with three, Fishlegs and Snotlout trail with NONE! Stoick eyes an empty basket at the far end, its backboard painted with an image of Toothless. 
STOICK (CONT'D) And Hiccup is... nowhere to be found. Hmmm. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 3. 
GOBBER Scared him off with the big talk, didn't ya, Stoick? WHACK! Snotlout, still smoldering from the blast, gets CLIPPED from behind. ASTRID, rolls in, astride STORMFLY -- spirited and competitive as ever, and beautiful despite herself. 
ASTRID What are you doing, Snotlout?! They're going to win now! 
SNOTLOUT She's my princess! Whatever she wants, she gets. 
ASTRID Ruffnut?! Didn't she try to bury you alive?! 
SNOTLOUT Only for a few hours! BACK TO THE RACERS, as they peel away, pouring on the speed. 
HICCUP (V.O.) Dragons used to be a bit of a problem here. But that was five years ago. Now they've all moved in. And, really, why wouldn't they? The racers chase each other through a sprawling hangar and into a vast cave, teeming with colorfully painted dragon stables. They exit through the far side and circle back through the village, blasting past many of its dragon- friendly additions. 
HICCUP (V.O.) We have custom stables... all-you- can-eat feeding stations... a full service dragon wash... 
In the village, a baby Gronkle sneezes, accidentally setting one of the Viking houses aflame. 
HICCUP (V.O.) Even top-of-the-line fire prevention, if I do say so myself. Astrid rolls her eyes, peels away from the other dragon racers, and yanks open a spout on the overhead network of aqueducts, dousing the flames with a surge of water. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 4. 
BACK TO STOICK, amused as he watches the racers round the island, searching for sheep. He turns to Gobber and nods. 
STOICK It's time, Gobber. 
GOBBER Righty-ho! (aloud, to the crowd) Last lap! A HORN sounds. The racers all turn to each other, excited. 
HICCUP (CONT'D) Ready? Toothless SNORTS unenthusiastically. Suddenly, Hiccup SLIDES OFF of Toothless, peeling away from him like a skydiver from a plane, YELLING as he plummets. 
Toothless dives after him. They spiral through the air, face- to-face. Toothless is having fun, despite himself. Hiccup slips his forearms through a pair of tucked leather flaps... and YANKS, unfurling SHEETS OF LEATHER as he extends his arms. They catch the wind, SNAPPING OPEN like WINGS... and sending him GLIDING -- out of control, at first, then stabilizing. The turbulence buffets his flight suit heavily. But he's flying! Toothless unfolds his wings, too, catching up with Hiccup. The freedom is palpable. Hiccup and Toothless are, for the moment, the same. Feeling the same rush of adrenaline. Independently together. They PLUNGE past cloud formations, splitting apart then crossing paths again. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 8. 
Impressive as it is, Hiccup is gliding at a steep angle. Toothless launches fireballs ahead of Hiccup, boosting him higher with the expanding heat bursts. 
HICCUP (CONT'D) This is amazing! A cloud layer washes past, exposing a towering ROCK FORMATION, dead ahead. 
HICCUP (CONT'D) No longer amazing! Toothless! Hiccup tries to steer himself away, to no avail. Toothless POURS ON THE SPEED, trying to catch Hiccup as he HURTLES toward collision. His locked tail makes maneuvering difficult. He's UNABLE TO PULL UP at a steep enough angle. 
HICCUP (CONT'D) Oh, no! At the last second, Toothless BLASTS the jagged rocks just ahead of Hiccup, then WRAPS Hiccup in his wings as they fly through it. The obliterated peak rains down around them. Toothless emerges through the cloud of debris and HURTLES into the trees of a neighboring peak. They tumble down the uneven terrain, coming to rest on a small plateau. Hiccup emerges from the cocoon of Toothless' wings. He switches his prosthetic riding foot to his walking foot and stows his leather wings. 
HICCUP (CONT'D) That really came out of nowhere. The blown up sea stack collapses. 
HICCUP (CONT'D) We gotta work on your solo gliding there, bud. That locked-up tail makes for some pretty sloppy rescue maneuvers, eh? Hiccup reels in his dorsal fin and removes his helmet, revealing a 20 year old Hiccup framed by wild hair, complete with a Viking braid. He walks to the edge of the cliff, taking in the NEW LAND stretching off into the horizon, its tall cliffs and sea- stacks adorned with swaying gold birch trees basking in the dappled afternoon sunlight. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 9. 
HICCUP (CONT'D) Looks like we found another one, bud. Toothless FUSSES and SNORTS, not amused, shaking off dust and pebbles like a wet dog. Hiccup flinches as a pebble WHACKS him on the back of the head. He looks back to Toothless, who averts his eyes. 
HICCUP (CONT'D) Oh, what? Do you want an apology? Is that why you're pouting, big baby boo? Well... try this on! Hiccup TACKLES Toothless and tries to put him in a headlock. 
HICCUP (CONT'D) Ya feeling it yet? Huh? Picking up on all my heartfelt remorse? Toothless simply stands on his hind legs, lifting Hiccup off of his flailing feet and dangling him over the cliff's edge. 
HICCUP (CONT'D) Oh, come on. You wouldn't hurt a 
ONE-LEGGED-- 
Hiccup looks down, seeing the precipitous drop below. 
HICCUP (CONT'D) You're right! You're right! You win! You win! WHAM! Toothless flips him over, pinning him to the ground. Hiccup squirms, throwing mock punches. Toothless playfully retaliates with feline taps to Hiccup's head. 
HICCUP (CONT'D) He's down! And it's ugly! Dragons and Vikings, enemies again, locked in combat to the bitter -- URFFF! Toothless rests his head on Hiccup -- SQUEEZING THE AIR out of him. Toothless then suddenly starts grooming Hiccup, lapping at his face and covering him in slobber. 
HICCUP (CONT'D) Gaaaaagh! 
Hiccup fights to get free, finally springing to his feet and shaking off the viscous saliva. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 10. 
HICCUP (CONT'D) You KNOW that doesn't wash out. 
Toothless LAUGHS, pleased with himself. 
Shifting his attention back to the new land stretched out before them, Hiccup reaches beneath his chest plate and produces a leather-bound book. 
He unfurls it to reveal an EXPLORERS MAP, modified with added strips in every direction to accommodate their ever-expanding world. Drawings indicate new lands, new tribes, and many new dragons. Hiccup peels a fresh strip of paper from a hidden fold in his flight suit and holds it out for Toothless to lick. Hiccup affixes the moistened strip to the map's outer edge, then whittles a pencil and consults a compass affixed to his forearm. 
HICCUP (CONT'D) So what should we name it? Toothless GURGLES as he gnaws under his wing, preoccupied. 
HICCUP (CONT'D) "Itchy Armpit" it is. Hiccup carefully draws the new island's outline. 
HICCUP (CONT'D) Whaddya reckon, bud? Think we might find a few Timberjacks in those woods? The odd Whispering Death or two in the rocks? Who knows... maybe we'll finally track down another Night Fury. 
(BEAT) Wouldn't that be something? 
(BURDENED) So, whaddya say? Just keep going? Toothless' ear plates suddenly SHOOT UP. He ROARS, and his call is answered by a familiar SCREECH. Hiccup turns to see... 
EXT. SEA STACK/ISLAND COASTLINE - DAY 
(Scene 0325 - AWOL Part Two) 
ASTRID rising into view, astride Stormfly. Stormfly grabs talon-fulls of rock to slow her landing. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 11. 
HICCUP `Afternoon m'lady. Where have you been? 
Astrid dismounts and throws back her fur hood as Toothless rushes up to greet them. 
ASTRID Winning races. What else? The real question is... where have YOU been? 
HICCUP Avoiding my dad. 
ASTRID Oh, no. What happened now? 
Astrid sits beside Hiccup, inspecting his latest addition to the map. Behind them, Toothless greets Stormfly, inciting a play fight. 
HICCUP Oh, you're gonna love this. I wake up. The sun's shining. Terrible Terrors are singing on the rooftop. I saunter down to breakfast, thinking all is right with the world, and I get... 
He gets to his feet and puffs out his chest. 
HICCUP (CONT'D) 
She places a hand on his chest. 
ASTRID (CONT'D) It's in here. 
(BEAT) Maybe you just don't see it yet. 
She kisses his cheek, but gets a mouthful of Toothless' slobber. She grimaces, wiping it off. 
Distracted, Hiccup eyes the horizon keenly. 
HICCUP Maybe. But, y'know... there is something out there. 
ASTRID 
(EXASPERATED) Hiccup... 
He turns her face to the horizon. A distant smoke plume rises from a misty valley. 
EXT. LAPLAND WOODS/TRAPPER'S FORT - MOMENTS LATER 
(Scene 0400 - Shot Down!) Hiccup and Toothless fly over the fjord, winding deep through undulating crimson and gold forests. 
Astrid and Stormfly catch up as the autumn colors suddenly give way to charred timbers. They fly deeper, through ash and wafting smoke. Ahead, in a sheltered harbor, an explosion of ice stands as an eerie marker of what used to be a TRAPPER'S 
FORT. 
HICCUP Stay close. 
They fly through the suspended remains of the buildings, splintered, and frozen in mid-destruction. 
HICCUP (CONT'D) What happened here? HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 15. 
It's at once harrowing and puzzling. Toothless spots an enormous DRAGON FOOTPRINT in the muddy shoreline below, leaving him uneasy. 
HICCUP (CONT'D) Easy, bud. 
As they crest the ice formations, Astrid spots a CREW OF MEN at the stern of a moored ship below. 
ASTRID Hiccup! 
ERET (O.S.) Fire! 
The men fire a stern-mounted cannon. The projectile unfurls into a NET. Hiccup and Toothless dart out of its way. 
HICCUP Astrid! Look out! 
It HITS Stormfly, TANGLING her wings and causing her to spin uncontrolled. Astrid struggles to free her as they HURTLE toward a collision. 
ASTRID 
HICCUP! 
Astrid falls off of Stormfly, but Toothless SNATCHES her at the last second. 
Stormfly hits the ground, tangled in the net. Trappers rush out of hiding, piling onto her with ropes and weapons. She whips her tail, sending spikes flying. 
ERET Watch the tail! 
A large, raven-haired trapper lunges over the spray of spikes and lands upon Stormfly's head, twisting it and taking her down like a rodeo cowboy. 
ERET (CONT'D) Tie those legs up! 
Eret deftly ties her gnashing jaws shut, wrangling her into submission -- clearly a pro among pros. He looks up, revealing a handsome face and gleaming, intelligent eyes that search the sky as Toothless' tell-tale BANSHEE scream rings out. 
ERET (CONT'D) Is that what I think it is? HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 16. 
Toothless suddenly streaks across the sky, banking and landing with a FEROCIOUS ROAR. 
HICCUP 
STOP! 
ASTRID 
STORMFLY! (to the trappers) What are you doing? 
Astrid and Hiccup leap off of Toothless, rushing toward Stormfly. 
YOU WILL NEVER HOLD ON TO THOSE 
DRAGONS, YOU HEAR ME?! DRAGO IS 
COMING FOR THEM ALL! 
I/E. BERK/BLACKSMITH STALL - SUNSET 
(Sequence 0500 - Lock-Down!) HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 19. 
The GANG joyrides past GOTHI'S house, scattering her assortment of terrible terrors. She waves a fist at them as they sweep past, WHOOPING AND CHORTLING, leading us down to... 
THE UPPER PLAZA, where a GATHERED CROWD of Vikings and their dragons are cued up outside of Gobber's BLACKSMITH STALL, awaiting their turns. Stoick maneuvers through the crowd, spouting JOVIAL GREETINGS in passing. 
He makes a bee-line for GOBBER, who is busily grinding a metal dragon tooth into shape. A Zippleback waits patiently, his head cocked open like a car hood while the other head watches, sympathetically. 
STOICK Any sign of him? 
Gobber flips up his welding guard, revealing a matching area of unsoiled skin. 
GOBBER Ah, he's probably flown off the edge of the world by now. You sure you want that kid running the village? You can still delay your retirement. 
STOICK Oh, he's ready. You'll see. 
A SUDDEN EXCITEMENT in the crowd heralds Hiccup and Astrid's return. They touch down on Toothless and Stormfly. 
STOICK (CONT'D) Haha! There he is! (to Gobber, proving his 
POINT) Huh? The pride of Berk! 
Hiccup stows his helmet and heads toward Stoick with urgency. 
GOBBER Who finally decided to show up for work. Yay. 
HICCUP Sorry. Got held up. (privately, to Stoick) Hey, Dad, could I have a word? 
STOICK Something you're itching to tell me? HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 20. 
HICCUP Not quite the itch you're thinking of, but yes. 
Stoick hands him an apron and guides him to the front desk. 
STOICK Good man! Now, lesson one. A chief's first duty is to his people. So... 
Stoick changes the rune on the "being served" placard. 
STOICK (CONT'D) Forty one? Forty -- 
HICCUP Could we just talk in private for-- 
STARKARD --That's me! That's me! I'm next! (pushing his way through) I was ahead of you! Excuse me, I've been here all day! 
STARKARD reaches the counter, giddy with excitement. 
STARKARD (CONT'D) Okay, I want one of those high seaters, with lots of spikes and a big stowage compartment. 
STOICK Absolutely! You got it, sir! 
Stoick spins Hiccup around, steering him back into the shop. 
HICCUP Dad, this is actually a little more important than building saddles. 
STOICK Ah-ah! Lesson two. No task is too small when it comes to serving your people. Excuse us, Grump. 
They step over the tail of a large, snoring oaf of a dragon, stirring him awake with a fussy start. 
GOBBER Grump! You let the forge die down again! HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 21. 
Grump coughs a slug of molten lava into the forge. It splatters everywhere, igniting a rash of fires. Hiccup side- steps them as he gathers materials in the back of the stall. Gobber pulls the fire extinguisher, dumping water everywhere. 
GOBBER (CONT'D) That's it, Grump. You're going up for adoption! 
Stoick fills a toolbox with tools from Hiccup's workbench. 
STOICK One of these. And this... 
HICCUP 
HICCUP What? Why?! 
Hiccup, Astrid, Gobber, and Toothless chase after Stoick. 
STOICK 
SEAL THE GATES! LOWER THE STORM 
DOORS! 
HICCUP Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait! What is happening? 
GOBBER You heard the man! Lock it down! 
Behind him, the massive storm doors rattle as they're lowered. 
STOICK No DRAGON or VIKING sets foot off this island until I give the word! HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 24. 
HICCUP Because some guy you knew is stirring up trouble in some faraway land? 
Stoick turns to Hiccup, gravely serious. 
STOICK Because Drago Bludvist is a madman. Without conscience or mercy. And if he's built a dragon army... gods help us all. 
Stoick continues on shouting orders, leaving Hiccup stewing. 
STOICK (CONT'D) Get them into their pens! Quickly! 
Hiccup chases around to confront Stoick. 
HICCUP Then let's ride back out there. We'll follow those trappers to Drago and talk some sense into him. 
STOICK No. We fortify the island. 
HICCUP It's our duty to keep the peace! 
STOICK Peace is over, Hiccup. I must prepare you for war. 
HICCUP War? Dad, if Drago's coming for our dragons, we can't wait around for him to get here. Let's go find him and change his mind. 
STOICK Some minds won't be changed, Hiccup. Berk is what you need to worry about. 
(BEAT) A chief protects his own. 
Stoick heads off, calling out more orders... 
STOICK (CONT'D) 
SECURE THE STABLES! LATCH EVERY 
STALL! HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 25. 
... leaving Hiccup eyeing Toothless as the storm doors close. Astrid approaches him, seeing the determination on his face. 
ASTRID Hiccup, don't. 
HICCUP I have to. 
He gives her a quick peck on the cheek. 
STOICK 
THIS WAY! QUICKLY! 
Hiccup and Toothless BLAST PAST, heading for the exit. 
STOICK (CONT'D) 
HICCUP! 
They try to fly through one door, but it seals shut. 
HICCUP Come on! 
Toothless spins around and DIVES through the gap in the second lowering storm door. 
STOICK Hiccup! 
Toothless paws at the embers. 
HICCUP (CONT'D) Once they see you as one of their own, even the testiest dragons can be trained, right, bud? 
Toothless gurgles and falls over. 
ERET Give me that! 
Eret snatches the dragon blade and HURLS it overboard. Stormfly bolts after it... 
ERET (CONT'D) What game are you playing? 
HICCUP No game. We just want to meet Drago. 
And returns in a flash, dropping it at Eret's feet like a fetching dog, tongue wagging. Eret throws it again, frustrated. Stormfly returns with it just as quickly. 
ERET Why? 
HICCUP Because I'm going to change his mind about dragons. 
Eret and his crew LAUGH. Astrid pokes out of the well. 
ASTRID He can be really persuasive. 
Hiccup pets Toothless, thoughtfully. 
HICCUP Once you've earned his loyalty, there is nothing a dragon won't do for you. 
ERET Puh! You won't be changing any minds around here. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 29. 
HICCUP I can change yours. Right here. Right now. 
Hiccup sets Toothless' tail in the locked, splayed position. Eret sneers, suspicious. 
HICCUP (CONT'D) May I? 
Suddenly, Hiccup is snatched into the air! Dragons blur past. 
I/E. OPEN SEA - SHIP - SUNSET 
(Scene 1000 - Botched Rescue) 
The crewmen SCRAMBLE to the NET CANNONS as a FLURRY OF WINGS streak past, GASHING holes in the sails and SLICING through rigging. 
ERET Dragon riders! 
Toothless SHRIEKS and bounds up the mast, spotting Hiccup in the talons of a Monstrous Nightmare. Toothless relaxes, realizing that it's Hookfang. 
HICCUP Put me down! Snotlout! What are you doing? 
Snotlout looks back to see if Ruffnut witnessed the save. 
SNOTLOUT See how well I protect and provide? Ruffnut GRUMBLES at the incessant courting. A FLYING NET whizzes past her head. 
TUFFNUT Aggh! What is with all the nets?! 
RUFFNUT Hey watch it! That was close... 
Ruffnut spots Eret, FIRING nets from the deck of the ship. 
TRANSITION TO: 
A SLOW MOTION, sexy POV of Eret's glistening biceps, shuddering as he BLASTS the net cannon, aimed directly at her. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 30. 
RUFFNUT (CONT'D) Oh, my. 
The net unravels in SLOW MOTION... 
RUFFNUT (CONT'D) Me likey. 
... enveloping Ruffnut as she yields to it, blissfully. 
RUFFNUT (CONT'D) Take me. 
BACK TO REAL TIME 
As Hiccup FLIPS upside-down in the Hookfang's talons and KICKS off, pulling his wing-suit flaps. 
RUFFNUT Stupid. 
TUFFNUT Good one. 
STOICK Aye. We laughed, too... 
BACK TO FLASHBACK 
STOICK (CONT'D) Until he wrapped himself in his cloak and cried out, "Then see how well you do without me!" 
Drago Bludvist pulls the dragon skin cloak over himself and marches toward the door. Above, dragon fire rips through the ceiling, bringing down flaming timbers, followed by dragons covered in heavy metallic armor. They BLAST FIRE as panic ensues. 
STOICK (V.O.) The rooftop suddenly burst into flames, and from it, armored dragons descended, burning the hall to the ground. 
BACK TO PRESENT HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 33. 
STOICK 
(STINGING REGRET) I... was to only one to escape. 
The Twins, Snotlout, and Fishlegs exchange spooked glances. 
STOICK (CONT'D) 
(TO HICCUP) Men who kill without reason cannot be reasoned with. 
HICCUP Maybe. 
Hiccup turns and stomps toward Toothless, determined. Eret watches intently. 
STOICK Hiccup... 
HICCUP I'm still going to try. 
Hiccup jumps onto Toothless and locks eyes with Stoick. 
HICCUP (CONT'D) This is what I'm good at. And if I could change your mind... I can change his, too. 
(TO TOOTHLESS) Come on. 
Toothless and Hiccup TAKE TO THE AIR, leaving everyone stirring in awkward silence. 
Astrid mounts Stormfly, about to go after him. 
ASTRID Let's go. 
STOICK NO! Lead the others back to Berk. I've had enough mutiny for one day. 
Astrid stirs, conflicted, as Stoick stomps toward Skullcrusher, fuming. He passes Ruffnut, who's busily fondling Eret's biceps as he lays crushed under Grump. 
RUFFNUT Ooh, I like that. 
STOICK Ruffnut! HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 34. 
RUFFNUT 
(PETULANT) Ugh! Okay! 
EXT. SKY - NIGHT 
(Scene 1100 - Ambushed!) Hiccup stares ahead, frustrated, as Toothless glides over a bed of clouds, glowing in the low, Arctic sun. Hiccup YELLS, then slumps back onto the saddle. Toothless recoils, sensitive to Hiccup's upset. The steam from their breath mixes in the frigid air. 
HICCUP Don't worry, bud. I'm not gonna let anything happen to you. I promise. Toothless' ear plates perk up. He glances over his shoulder to see a disturbance in the blanket of clouds. A strange and arresting MASKED WARRIOR rises from the clouds, standing upon something unseen. Its armor and cape flap in the buffeting turbulence. The warrior eyes Toothless and Hiccup, pulling up alongside them. Hiccup senses the approaching figure in his periphery and sits up, flustered. 
HICCUP (CONT'D) 
AW, COME ON, DAD! REALLY?! He whirls around expectantly then FREEZES, mouth agape. The warrior stares blankly, tilting his head in curiosity while cutting a menacing silhouette. Then, just as gradually as he rose, the warrior dips back beneath the clouds, disappearing. 
HICCUP (CONT'D) 
(ALARMED) Okay. 
(TO TOOTHLESS) No sudden moves. Suddenly, the warrior EXPLODES out of the clouds before them, standing atop a large dragon. They circle Hiccup and Toothless, forcing them to TREAD AIR. 
The warrior points a staff toward Hiccup, unnervingly, as he returns to face them. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 35. 
HICCUP (CONT'D) Hold on, hold on. Toothless GROWLS a warning. Suddenly, they're ambushed from behind. Hiccup is plucked off of Toothless by another DRAGON and carried off. 
The warrior slowly removes the strange mask, revealing VALKA, 40, beneath. Her eyes meet his, equally wide-eyed and aghast. 
VALKA ... but a mother never forgets. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 38. 
Hiccup stammers, tongue-tied, aghast. 
VALKA (CONT'D) Come... 
EXT. ARCTIC SKY - NIGHT (MIDNIGHT SUN) 
(Sequence 1325 - Searching) 
Stoick and Gobber search over the frigid waves that lap against the pack ice. 
STOICK Boar-headed! Just like his mother! She could never stay put either. 
Gobber glances over at Stoick, who's hunched over, brow furrowed and solemn. 
GOBBER Ah, he's just twenty. And a Viking. I mean, could there be a worse combination? Ha! When I think of how stubborn and senseless YOU were back in the day... well, not much has changed, actually. 
STOICK You know what he's like. He won't give up, Gobber. And if Hiccup finds Drago, before we find him... 
GOBBER Bah! NOTHING can hurt Hiccup so long as that Night Fury's around. It's a Night Fury! Framed by a hole in the ice, a glistening object bobs on the surface below. Stoick squints and CIRCLES BACK, leading Skullcrusher in a DIVE toward it. Stoick SNAGS it out of the water. It's Hiccup's helmet. 
Gobber pulls alongside Stoick, seeing his look of dread. Stoick holds the helmet out for his dragon to SMELL. 
STOICK Find him, Skullcrusher. Find him. 
Skullcrusher SNIFFS the helmet like a bloodhound, ROARS, and suddenly CHANGES HEADING. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 39. 
INT. DRAGON MOUNTAIN - TUNNEL - DAWN 
(Scene 1400 - A New Family) 
CLOSE ON Hiccup, flustered, winded, chasing VALKA through tightly winding corridors. 
HICCUP Hold on! Wait just a minute! Come back here! 
VALKA This way. Come. 
HICCUP You can't just say something like that and run off! You're my mother?! I mean, what the -- do you grasp how INSANE it sounds?! 
(BEAT) I have questions! 
VALKA Come. Quickly! 
Hiccup follows her over the difficult terrain. He tries to clamber over a tall rock, unsuccessfully. 
HICCUP Where have you been all this time? 
Toothless boosts him over. Hiccup lands on the other side. 
HICCUP (CONT'D) What've you been doing?! They said you were dead! Everyone thinks you were eaten by... Hiccup trails off as he enters... 
INT. DRAGON MOUNTAIN - OASIS - CONTINUOUS 
... a stadium-sized chamber teeming with ferns, waterfalls, hot springs and THOUSANDS of new DRAGONS. 
Hiccup wanders in, basking in the in the amazing sight: a dome of sweating ice capping a geothermal micro climate, filled with dragons of every shape and kind. 
He spots Valka clinging to a basalt overhang, watching him. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 40. 
HICCUP This is where you've been for twenty years? 
She nods from her perch. 
HICCUP (CONT'D) You've been rescuing them. 
She nods again, this time with a smile. 
HICCUP (CONT'D) Unbelievable. 
VALKA You're not upset? 
HICCUP What? No. I don't know. It's a bit much to get my head around, to be frank. It's not every day you find out your mother is some kind of crazy, feral, vigilante dragon lady. 
Valka chuckles, and using her dragon's wing, lowers herself to the ground like a skilled acrobat. 
FLASHBACK CONTINUED 
Cloudjumper enters the house through the hole in the roof, sniffing out a baby's cradle in the corner. 
Valka rushes in, panicked. 
VALKA (V.O.) One night, a dragon broke into our house, finding you in the cradle. 
Valka draws a sword quietly, slipping up to the dragon, only to find it huddled protectively over the cradle as BABY HICCUP innocently plays with one of its talons. 
VALKA (V.O.) I rushed to protect you, but what I saw... was proof of everything I believed. 
Valka's careful approach causes a floorboard to squeak. Spooked, Cloudjumper whips around to face her, accidentally SCRATCHING baby Hiccup's chin. 
Their eyes meet. Valka lowers her sword, transfixed. 
VALKA (V.O.) This wasn't a vicious beast, but an intelligent, gentle creature, whose soul reflected my own. 
Stoick's AXE spins through the air between them, barely missing Cloudjumper and planting into a pillar. 
STOICK Valka, run! 
Alarmed, Cloudjumper WHIRLS around at Stoick and BLASTS! 
Stoick DIVES out of the way as the FIRE SPLATTERS against the wall, burning a hole and setting the room ablaze. 
The dragon moves toward Stoick, but Valka grabs hold. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 44. 
VALKA Don't! 
It turns to face her again, locking eyes, agitated. 
STOICK Hold on! 
Stoick dashes through the fire toward Hiccup and pulls him out of the cradle. He pulls his axe from the pillar... 
VALKA (O.S.) No! Stoick! 
... but in a WHOOSH of smoke and embers, the dragon and Valka are GONE. 
STOICK 
VALKA! 
VALKA 
(DISTANT) Stoick! 
Stoick and baby Hiccup watch helplessly as the dragon spirits Valka away into the night sky. 
STOICK Valka... 
ON BABY HICCUP'S FACE, with the fresh nick on his chin... 
MATCH CUT TO: 
INT. DRAGON MOUNTAIN - DAWN 
PRESENT DAY 
HICCUP'S FACE, with the matching scar. 
VALKA You and your father nearly died that night, all because I couldn't kill a dragon. 
HICCUP Yeah, it runs in the family. 
VALKA It broke my heart to stay away, but I believed you'd be safer if I did. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 45. 
Hiccup considers this, then raises his eyes to hers, seeing the sting of remorse. 
HICCUP How did you survive? 
VALKA Oh, Cloudjumper never meant to harm me. He must've thought I belonged here... 
She leads him to the edge of raised natural terrace, overlooking the steamy oasis with its flowing hot spring waterfalls. Half-submerged in the warm lake below, a massive white dragon with pronounced, mammoth-like tusks rests benevolently on the banks, his stately countenance like that of a lion surrounded by his pride. 
VALKA (CONT'D) In the home of the great Bewilderbeast. The alpha species. One of very few that still exist. 
ASTRID Careful what you wish for! 
UG (O.S.) 
ERET SON OF ERET! HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 48. 
Nets whiz past as Astrid and the Gang rocket out of range. 
ERET What is this?! 
ASTRID A kidnapping. 
Ruffnut grabs his leg, clutching him possessively. 
RUFFNUT Yay! Can he ride with me? Can he? Can he? 
Both Eret and Tuffnut groan in protest. 
ASTRID You're gonna show us the way to Drago. 
ERET And help dragon riders sneak into Drago's camp? Just kill me now. 
ASTRID That can be arranged. Stormfly, drop it. 
In enthusiastic response, Stormfly pops open her talons, sending Eret plummeting. He wails and flails as he hurtles toward the ice far below. 
ASTRID (CONT'D) Good girl! Stormfly, fetch. 
She dives after him, just as enthusiastically. ON ERET, terrified, as the ground rushes up at him. 
ERET 
ALL RIGHT! OKAY! I'LL TAKE YOU TO 
DRAGO! 
Stormfly suddenly SNATCHES him out of his free-fall just before hitting the ice. Astrid giggles and cracks her knuckles. 
ASTRID Works every time. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 49. 
EXT. SKY - EARLY MORNING 
(Scene 1600 - Momma's Boy) 
BEGIN MONTAGE 
Hiccup and Toothless follow Valka and Cloudjumper over a majestic fjord in the long rays of the low Arctic sun. 
Hiccup peers over his shoulder to see that a thick flock of dragons -- nearly all of Valka's rescues -- are close on their tail. He turns back to his mother, confused. 
HICCUP Hey, I thought we were going to eat? 
VALKA (with a mischievous grin) Oh, we are. 
She directs his gaze below, where in the choppy water of the fjord, a group of Seashocker dragons are corralling a dense shoal of fish near the surface. 
Suddenly, the Bewilderbeast rises from deep below, scooping the fish up in its vast mouth as its tusks break the surface. It breaches just below Hiccup and Toothless, giving them a fright before spitting the fish into the air and crashing back down into the sea. 
Valka laughs at Hiccup's surprise as the hungry dragons race for the flailing fish, scooping them out of the air. Hiccup gestures to Toothless to join in and he gladly scoops up a mouth full. 
EXT. SNOWY SHORELINE - LATER 
MONTAGE CONTINUES... 
Hiccup has his map spread out in the snow, explaining the various lands he's discovered during his explorations. 
HICCUP And from Dragon Island, I found this archipelago... 
He looks up to see that Valka is no longer next to him, but she has sketched out the rest of the northern land masses in the snow, wowing Hiccup with just how far and wide she has explored. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 50. 
She returned to Hiccup's side with a smile. But his amazement is interrupted by Toothless joining in, drawing all over Valka's map with a giant icicle. 
Hiccup simply shrugs as his mother giggles, and Cloudjumper sneers. 
EXT. WINDSWEPT CLIFF - LATER 
Valka and Hiccup rise on their dragons, carried skyward by a strong coastal wind that thrusts vertical up shoreline cliff. 
She pulls him into a hug -- forceful, bursting with emotion. Hiccup hugs Valka back. They share a cathartic moment, before Hiccup peels away from her. 
HICCUP (CONT'D) This is so great! Now you and I can go talk to Drago -- together! 
She chuckles, incredulous. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 53. 
VALKA What? There's no talking to Drago. 
HICCUP But we have to -- 
VALKA -- No. We must protect our own. 
Hiccup stares, exasperated by the familiar line. Cloudjumper lumbers over, eager to be rid of Toothless' puppy-like energy. Valka pets him. 
VALKA (CONT'D) Now come on, we should be getting back. 
Before Hiccup can say anymore, he hear heavy breathing next to him, and looks over to see Toothless with a gaping grin, clapping his dorsal blades. 
EXT. ICE CAVE - DAY 
(Scene 1350 - Meet Drago) 
Astrid and the gang stealthily approach a cluster of tabular icebergs, collapsed against each other at the mouth of a maze. Stormfly drops Eret to the snow, but before he can flee, she lands atop him and nests like a hen with her egg. 
ERET Agghh! Okay! I got you here, now get this thing off me! 
ASTRID Never take a toy from a dragon. Don't you know anything? 
Stormfly crushes him in place under her weight. 
ERET 
(STRAINED) Gah! Why does this keep happening to me? 
Astrid crawls up the rising ridge to reveal... 
A MASSIVE FLOTILLA, moored together like a floating camp in the deep water between collided icebergs. 
Thick chains run deep into the water, where great blasts of bubbles erupt on the surface. The unseen creature rocks the ships. Its effect alone describes it as gargantuan. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 54. 
ASTRID What's down there? 
Fishlegs rifles through his note cards contained in his belt pouch. 
FISHLEGS Large diameter bubbles, massive lungs, cold water deep dweller, I'm thinking class five leviathan, maybe six. 
Suddenly, Stormfly is alerted to an encroaching menace and takes wing. BLOW DARTS whiz through the air, hitting the other dragons. The effect is immediate -- they fall to the ground, unconscious. Drugged. 
HICCUP Meatlug! What's wrong, girl? 
Eret spring to his feet and draws his blades. Astrid and the Gang find themselves surrounded by soldiers, camouflaged in polar bear furs, and poised to fire darts. They're outnumbered. Fishlegs raises his hands, dropping the cards. 
EXT. DRAGO'S SHIP - DECK - MOMENTS LATER 
DRAGO BLUDVIST, a hulking figure draped in a dragon skin cloak, crouches over the prow of the fleet's grisly flagship, adorned in massive dragon bones and skulls. His scarred face is masked by thick, grizzled dreadlocks. 
ERET (O.S.) 
DRAGO! 
Drago turns to see Astrid, Eret, and the Gang being forcibly escorted onto the deck. Eret SHAKES HIMSELF FREE. 
ERET (CONT'D) Get off me! 
In the background, a sledge, loaded with Hookfang, Meatlug, Belch and Barf -- all unconscious -- is dragged onto the deck by armored dragons. 
ERET (CONT'D) Always great to see you, my friend! Keeping warm up here? 
The soldiers disarm him, pushing him forward as Drago approaches. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 55. 
ERET (CONT'D) Well, as you can see, I'm right on time with a new batch of dragons, just like I promised. 
Hookfang awakens, groggily shaking off the effect of the blow- dart. He rears as soldiers struggle to reign him in. 
SOLDIER #1 Watch out! He's waking up! Keep him steady! 
SOLDIER #2 Give me some backup here! 
ASTRID And unless you let us go, right now, he will blast through here on his Night Fury and blow your entire fleet of ships to splinters! 
Eret slips away, trying to distance himself from the tension. 
RUFFNUT Then they'll be crying like babies! 
SNOTLOUT Funny and beautiful. 
FISHLEGS Good one, babe! 
Ruffnut groans, exasperated by their smarmy advances. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 58. 
TUFFNUT Yeah. Like babies. They always cry. Real tiny ones... 
Drago grabs Eret by the face and bears down on him. 
DRAGO First there was one rider. And now all of Berk. 
(TO ERET) And YOU led them to me. 
He THROWS Eret across the deck. 
ERET Drago! 
DRAGO 
CEASE ALL PREPARATIONS! WE MUST 
ATTACK THE DRAGONS RIDER'S NEST AT 
ONCE! 
(SAVORING IT) 
WE WILL TAKE DOWN THEIR ALPHA... 
AND THEN WE WILL TAKE BERK! 
Soldiers CHEER in the thousands. 
ERET You're overreacting! 
DRAGO And get rid of him. 
ERET Drago, please... 
The soldiers HURL throwing knives at Eret... But Stormfly lands in a blur of wings, shielding Eret from the flurry of blades. She whips her tail, throwing spikes in all directions. 
ASTRID 
STORMFLY! 
Stormfly ROARS protectively, hiding Eret within her wings, until a well-blown dart sinks into her neck, bringing her down... 
ASTRID (CONT'D) 
NO! 
Revealing Eret, gawking in shock. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 59. 
INT. DRAGON MOUNTAIN - OASIS - MORNING 
(Scene 1800 - Family Reunion) 
Hiccup reattaches his flight suit while standing on a ledge overlooking the utopian nest, teeming with dragons. Several babies race in to hassle Toothless as he naps. 
HICCUP 
(DETERMINED) Well, bud, we can't wait around for Drago to attack this place. We've gotta find him first. Let's go. 
Suddenly, a thick hand clamps down over Hiccup's face -- muffling his scream! 
Toothless whirls around to find STOICK, towering over Hiccup. He calms Toothless with a touch and releases Hiccup. 
STOICK Easy now. 
HICCUP Are you kidding me? How'd you get in here? 
ON DRAGO'S SHIP HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 62. 
Eret, Astrid, and the Gang are escorted to the stern, surrounded by several of Drago's soldiers. Wrists bound. Spear tips pressed into their backs. 
SNOTLOUT Could this day get any worse? 
TUFFNUT Uh, let me see. You'll jump into freezing cold water and then die from drowning. 
They reach the gang plank. Eret peers overboard at the deep, icy water below. 
ERET Looks refreshing. 
He turns to Astrid, meeting her glare with mock chivalry. 
ERET (CONT'D) Please, ladies first. 
A pair of soldiers GRAB Astrid by the arms. 
ASTRID You are a steaming heap of dragon -- 
ERET -- Duck. 
Eret WHIRLS around, ROUND-HOUSING both soldiers. They GO DOWN, heavily. 
He catches one of their spears with his bound hands and slices his ropes free. They fall away as he catches the other spear, twirling both in invitation. 
SOLDIER Warn the others! 
One soldier runs to send up the alarm... while the last two raise BLOW DART TUBES. 
Eret SWIPES the first off of his legs, sending the dart into the neck of the second. 
RUFFNUT Get `em, you son of an Eret! 
As the downed soldiers SCRAMBLE to their feet, Fishlegs FALLS OVER, CRUSHING them under his weight. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 63. 
Eret CATCHES the falling tube from the second soldier and BLOWS the dart at the fleeing third. The soldier DROPS, unconscious -- just shy of the Captain's Quarters. 
RUFFNUT (CONT'D) Okay, I love you again. 
Ruffnut skips past Snotlout on her way to Eret. Snotlout watches, crestfallen. 
TUFFNUT Ugh. Pathetic. You can still jump. 
Eret avoids Ruffnut and turns to Astrid. 
ERET So? Are we going to save your dragons and get out of here or not? 
Astrid narrows her eyes, not knowing what to make of him. He reclaims his sword and dagger from the unconscious soldier who took them and cuts Tuffnut free. 
ERET (CONT'D) Check every trap. They're here somewhere. 
EXT. DRAGO'S SHIP - MOMENTS LATER 
Astrid slips under a tarp and cranks open a metal trap. She peers between its massive iron teeth, discovering Meatlug within, bound and chained to its base as bait. 
ASTRID Meatlug? 
ON ERET 
Carefully cranking another trap, wincing at the sound. The iron jaws of the trap open wider with every CLICK. 
ERET Anyone coming? 
Ruffnut "stands guard," fixated on Eret's rippling biceps. 
RUFFNUT I don't know. You just keep doing what you're doing. Keep crankin'... 
Eret squeezes between the cocked teeth, finding Stormfly within, muzzled and chained. She looks up at Eret, calming immediately. He pauses, then approaches slowly. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 64. 
Eret carefully reaches out and strokes Stormfly's muzzle. 
ERET Thank you for saving my life. 
(BEAT) Now let me return the favor. 
INT. DRAGON MOUNTAIN - VALKA'S LIVING QUARTERS - LATE 
STOICK (CONT'D) And love... 
Stoick hangs eagerly, awaiting her words, but Valka closes her eyes, rejecting his invitation. He lets out a heavy- hearted sigh. But nostalgia gets the better of Valka. She softly SINGS HER PART: 
VALKA 
(SINGING) And love me for eternity. 
Stoick beams. She brushes past him, setting into the center of the chamber and holding her forearm aloft in invitation. Stoick crosses his forearm against hers, initiating a beautiful dance to accompany the song. 
VALKA (CONT'D) 
(SINGING) My dearest one, my darling dear, you mighty words astound me. But I've no need of mighty deeds, when I feel your arms around me. 
The dance is full of charming missteps as Stoick and Valka recreate a moment from their past, before Hiccup's wonder- struck eyes. 
STOICK 
(SINGING) But I would bring you rings of gold. I'd even sing you poetry. 
(MORE) HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 67. 
STOICK (CONT'D) And I would keep you from all harm, if you'd stay here beside me. 
VALKA 
(SINGING) I have no use for rings of gold. I care not for your poetry. I only want your hand to hold. I only want you near me. 
Gobber can't help himself. He drags Hiccup onto his feet so that he can join in the dancing, too. 
GOBBER C'mon, Hiccup! 
VALKA, STOICK, & GOBBER 
(SINGING) To love and kiss, to sweetly hold. For the dancing and the dreaming. Through all life's sorrows and delights, I'll keep your love inside me. 
Hiccup is amazed by the sight of his giddy parents, spinning and laughing in each others' arms, reunited. 
VALKA, STOICK, & GOBBER (CONT'D) 
(SINGING) I'll swim and sail through savage seas, with ne'er a fear of drowning. And gladly ride the waves of life, if you will marry me! 
Gobber carries the last note... 
GOBBER 
(SINGING) I'm still going... 
Hiccup taps him. 
HICCUP Gobber! 
GOBBER I'm done. 
Valka and Stoick slow to a stop, WINDED and LAUGHING. 
STOICK Ah... I thought I'd have to die before we'd have that dance again. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 68. 
VALKA No need for drastic measures. 
STOICK For you, my dear... anything. 
She smiles sweetly. Stoick's eyes well with tears. He goes down on one knee, proposing to her anew. 
STOICK (CONT'D) Will you come home, Val? Will you be my wife once again? 
Toothless nudges Valka closer to Stoick. They laugh as Hiccup joins them. Stoick throws his arm around him. 
STOICK (CONT'D) We can be a family! What do you say? 
Valka, between tears and laughter, turns to Hiccup. 
VALKA Yes! 
Gobber pops his head in. 
GOBBER Great! I'll do the cooking! 
Drago points his bullhook toward Valka and Cloudjumper. 
DRAGO (CONT'D) Now finish her! 
Stoick whirls around, spotting Valka and Cloudjumper in the alpha's sights. 
STOICK No! 
Drago's Bewilderbeast INHALES... and BLASTS! Valka steers Cloudjumper out of the way, but ice HITS his tail, causing them to SPIRAL out of control toward the icy spires. 
STOICK (CONT'D) Hold on! 
He LEAPS onto Skullcrusher, spurring him into the air. 
STOICK (CONT'D) Skullcrusher, go! Come on, Gobber! 
Stoick tosses the mace back to Gobber in passing, who follows brazenly, waving it aloft. 
GOBBER Right behind ya, Stoick! 
EXT. DRAGON MOUNTAIN - CONTINUOUS 
(Scene 2000 - Stoick's Sacrifice) 
With his tail impaired, Cloudjumper struggles against a throng of oncoming dragons. Valka is knocked off, but manages to cling to her dragon's neck. As she loses her grip and FALLS... 
Stoick LEAPS from Skullcrusher and CATCHES Valka. He sinks his axe into an icy column, and they slide to a safe landing. Drago's Bewilderbeast presses closer, sniffing them out. 
BACK TO HICCUP, spotting Drago on the battlefield, commanding the Bewilderbeast to finish the job. 
HICCUP STOP! Stop! 
Hiccup lands Toothless a few paces from Drago and brazenly removes his helmet. Drago eyes him, incredulous, then begins to CHUCKLE. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 76. 
DRAGO This... is the great dragon master? The son of Stoick the Vast? What shame he must feel. 
Toothless snarls, ready to blast, but Hiccup calms him with a hand gesture. 
HICCUP All of this loss, and for what? To become unstoppable? To rule the world? 
Drago smirks and turns away from Hiccup. 
HICCUP (CONT'D) Dragons are kind, amazing creatures that can bring people together. 
DRAGO Or tear them apart. 
Drago LAUGHS mockingly, then removes his FALSE ARM, revealing a stump at his shoulder. Hiccup is taken aback. 
DRAGO (CONT'D) You see, I know what it is to live in fear. To see my village burned, my family taken. 
He reattaches the prosthesis, circling Hiccup menacingly. 
DRAGO (CONT'D) But even as a boy, left with nothing, I vowed to rise above the fear of dragons and liberate the people of this world. 
HICCUP Then why a dragon army? 
DRAGO (grinning, smug) Well, you need dragons to conquer other dragons. 
HICCUP Or maybe you need dragons to conquer people. 
(BEAT) To control those who follow you... and to get rid of those who won't. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 77. 
DRAGO Clever boy. 
Drago grabs his bullhook and re-approaches Hiccup. Toothless readies himself. 
HICCUP The world wants peace. And we have the answer, back on Berk. Just let me show you. 
DRAGO NO! Let ME show YOU. 
Drago SHRIEKS madly, summoning the Bewilderbeast. Toothless circles Hiccup, protectively. 
ON THE BEWILDERBEAST, about to blast Stoick and Valka. It hears Drago's distant wails, and approaches obediently. 
STOICK What...? 
Stoick follows its stare to the distant battlefield below. He spots Hiccup and Toothless a few paces from Drago. 
Valka arrives, winded and aghast. 
VALKA Stoick... She helps Hiccup to turn Stoick's body over. Valka presses her ear to Stoick's heart, confirming his death with a mere glance to Hiccup. He tears up, overwhelmed. 
HICCUP No... you... 
Gobber, Astrid, Eret, and the Gang arrive, slack-jawed. 
Satisfied, the Bewilderbeast turns away, releasing Toothless of the trance-like state. Toothless blinks, coming to and confused. He approaches the group, sniffing Stoick's hand. Hiccup SHOVES him. 
HICCUP (CONT'D) No! Get away from him! HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 80. 
Toothless recoils, innocently. 
HICCUP (CONT'D) 
GO ON! GET OUT OF HERE! GET AWAY! 
Toothless retreats like a scolded dog, ear plates back and head hung low. Valka watches, broken-hearted, as Hiccup falls upon Stoick, inconsolable. 
VALKA It's not his fault. You know that. 
On the battlefield, the alpha BELLOWS, calling all of the dragons to gather. Meatlug, Stormfly, Hookfang and the others all follow the command as the Gang calls after them. 
VALKA (O.S.) (CONT'D) Good dragons under the control of bad people do bad things. 
Drago notices Toothless tumble down a snow-bank, once again slit-eyed and entranced, but unable to fly to the alpha without a rider. Drago pins him down, eyeing the saddle, pedals, and prosthetic tail. 
ON HICCUP and VALKA 
In tears as Toothless rises into view, with Drago in the saddle. 
DRAGO 
GATHER THE MEN AND MEET AT BERK! 
His soldiers cheer in the thousands. 
HICCUP Toothless! Hiccup tries to go after Toothless, but Valka holds him back. 
VALKA No, don't! 
Drago JABS his bull hook and points toward the horizon. The alpha BELLOWS, commanding an exodus as it leads the way. 
DRAGO Move out! 
Hiccup watches, powerless as all dragons TAKE WING and follow. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 81. 
EXT. DRAGON MOUNTAIN - LAGOON - DUSK 
(Scene 2100 - Viking Funeral) 
A KEEL grinds against the shoreline pebbles as a listing, battered ship is pushed into the still iceberg-filled lagoon. 
GOBBER (V.O.) May the Valkyries welcome you, and lead you through Odin's great battlefield. May they sing your name with love and fury, so that we might hear it rise from the heights of Valhalla... and know that you've taken your rightful place at the table of kings. 
Bows and pitch-dipped arrows are gathered from the battlefield. Gobber hands a set to Hiccup, meeting his eyes with sympathetic glance. 
GOBBER (V.O.) For a great man has fallen. A warrior. A chieftain. A father. A friend. 
Hiccup dips his arrowhead in a smoldering chunk of wreckage, igniting the pitch that coats the tip. 
He releases his arrow, which sails through the air and lands on the deck of the ship, where Stoick is laid out on a pyre, covered by a sail, his axe upon his chest. 
The others follow Hiccup's lead. They DRAW BACK in unison and LOOSE their arrows, filling the sky with crisscrossing, flaming streaks. They arc over the lagoon and set the ship alight. ON HICCUP, fighting back emotion and losing the battle. 
HICCUP I'm sorry, Dad. 
He eyes the engulfed ship. 
HICCUP (CONT'D) I'm not the chief that you wanted me to be. And I'm not peacekeeper I thought I was. I don't know... 
Valka watches him, her heart breaking. She steps forward. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 82. 
VALKA You came early into this world. You were such a wee thing. So frail, so fragile. I feared you wouldn't make it. 
Hiccup lowers his eyes, but Valka lifts his chin. 
Toothless calls over his shoulder, commanding the dragons to ready themselves. He then BLASTS the Bewilderbeast, mid- charge. Suddenly, Skullcrusher fires. Followed by another, and another. 
Hiccup looks around, amazed to see the flock of dragons opening fire on Drago and his Bewilderbeast. They've started a rebellion. 
Drago is forced to hide from the fiery barrage by taking cover in the tall spines of the giant's crown. 
DRAGO (CONT'D) 
FIGHT! BLAST THEM! 
His prosthetic arm is blasted clean off by one of his own armored dragons. 
The Bewilderbeast rears back to cover them all in ice, but Toothless lets loose a powerful shot. The Bewilderbeast's head is KNOCKED backward by a blue-flame fireball. 
As the smoke clears, one of its massive TUSKS FALLS to the ground, sheared clean off. Drago glares at Toothless. 
Toothless ROARS commandingly, calling an end to the fight. 
HICCUP The alpha protects them all. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 94. 
Overwhelmed and overpowered, the Bewilderbeast yields to the new alpha and heeds Toothless' command, retreating into the sea in an explosive splash. 
The Berkians CHEER in victory! 
As the smoke clears, Hiccup and Toothless see nothing but bubbles on the waves to mark their disappearance. No sign of the Bewilderbeast... or Drago. 
Toothless hops down from the spire, cooling off, as people celebrate all around them. 
All of the dragons -- Berk's, Valka's, even Drago's -- land around Toothless. Cloudjumper bows to Toothless, starting a wave of bows, acknowledging their new alpha. 
Toothless looks around, surprised, then lets out a majestic ROAR. The assembled dragons join in, roaring in tribute. 
Toothless turns to Hiccup as he approaches. 
HICCUP (CONT'D) You never cease to amaze me, bud. Thank you. 
Toothless GURGLES and licks Hiccup's face. Hiccups squeals, trying to get away. 
HICCUP (CONT'D) Toothless! You know that doesn't wash out. 
The crowd laughs. All around them, Berk's dragons reunite with their Vikings. 
ASTRID Stormfly! 
Stormfly bounds into Astrid. 
GOBBER Oh, give me a cuddle, Grumpy! 
Grump lands ON TOP of Gobber, flattening him. 
Relieved to the point of tears, Snotlout and Fishlegs race towards the expectant Ruffnut... 
FISHLEGS Who's my little princess? 
... and then right PAST her to embrace their dragons. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 95. 
FISHLEGS (CONT'D) I missed you so much! 
SNOTLOUT Don't you ever leave again, Hookfang! 
Ruffnut GRUMBLES, dejected. Barf dips his head in to console her. 
RUFFNUT Oh Barf! 
She hugs him. Belch looms in for some affection, but Ruffnut pushes him away... 
RUFFNUT (CONT'D) Not you. 
And into Tuffnut who glowers back at her. 
Hiccup smiles, taking in the happy reunions. Skullcrusher approaches him, without an owner to reunite with. Hiccup pets him, as Eret approaches. 
ERET That was some pretty fine dragon wrangling back there. You'd make a good trapper. 
Before Hiccup can respond, Skullcrusher nuzzles Eret affectionately. Eret chuckles and gently strokes him. 
HICCUP Y'know, Skullcrusher's gonna need somebody to look after him now.

Joon: in that order? 
Benny: what happened between you and Mrs Smeal? 
Joon: she was given the fits of semi-precious metaphors. 
Benny: the womans a house keeper Joon, not an English professor. 
Joon: she moved things. 
Benny: she said you wandered off. Did you leave the house alone? 
Joon: define alone 
Benny: you know full well what Im talking about. Listen, while im at work I cant be worried about whether or not your knocking another house keeper into early retirement. First it was Mrs Larkburg. 
Joon: a woman deeply and hygienically disturbed. Her hair smelled. 
Benny: but then it was Mrs Piltz. 
Joon: Piltz, the answers in the question. Lets face it Benjamin, hiring house keepers is not your forte. 
Benny: Oh yeah, well until I do find another house keeper, you are going to stick close to the house, you understand? Now have some salad. Oh by the way, I want you to come with me to my poker game

Benny: Joon. You got a roommate? When did you get a roommate? 
Mike: since last week. My cousin landed in town and my life has gone from heaven to hell in 7 days. 
Thomas: Just like the good lord intended 
Mike: yeah, 20 years old and he cant even read. He spends all day polishing my plastic forks. 
Eric: what do you mean when you say he cant read? You mean words?

Eric: a group home is the right thing for her Benny. 
Benny: yeah, this is defiantly for her own good 
Eric: hey, its for both your own good. How much longer can you do this to your self? Youre life is literally passing you by 
Benny: youre right. Youre right. What am I doing with myself? I spend my life working on cars and taking care of my sister. I cant even have a relationship without having to worry how Joon is going to fit in. 
Eric: you know, once you get settled in you can actually take a vacation. Travel a little. I can hold down the fort no problem. 
Benny: travel? Travel? 
Eric: Benny, there is a whole world out there man, I mean picture yourself on the open road, wind in the hair in the Alcamino. Highway stretching out b- whats that? Up ahead? A lovely motorist. Stranded. Carburettor trouble. Better investigate.

Benny: is that a fact? 
Joon is in bed and Benny walks in 
Joon: he can really cook cant he?

Joon: thats what I told him 
Benny: really? What did he use? 
Joon: rayon. Silk would have been too soggy. Cotton would 
Benny: would of burned it 
Joon: right. Fortunately he consulted me before giving it steam. I was four square against it. I wish he could be my new smeal.

Benny: good night 
Joon: good night 
The next morning and Sam is writing a letter to him mum 
Joon: you need some help? Dear mum, I have departed Mikes with love and gratitude and am not living with Benny and Joon pearl, two magnificently devoted new friends.

Sam; yeah. Do you like avocadoes? 
Joon: theyre a fruit you know. 
Sam: Ruthie, do you got any avocadoes?

Sam: like what? 
Benny: I dont know all I know is that they were saying this guy is something else. Youre special. Youre not some regular schmoe like the rest of us who do it because we have to do it. Youre blessed

TITLE					    PART I AFRICA 3,000,000 YEARS AGO 
A1 VIEWS OF AFRICAN DRYLANDS - DROUGHT 
The remorseless drought had lasted now for ten million years, and would not end for another million. The reign of the ter- rible lizards had long since passed, but here on the continent which would one day be known as Africa, the battle for survival had reached a new climax of ferocity, and the victor was not yet in sight. In this dry and barren land, only the small or the swift or the fierce could flourish, or even hope to exist. 
a1 
A2 INT & EXT CAVES - MOONWATCHER 
The man-apes of the field had none of these attributes, and they were on the long, pathetic road to racial extinction. About twenty of them occupied a group of caves overlooking a small, parched valley, divided by a sluggish, brown stream. 
The tribe had always been hungry, and now it was starving. As the first dim glow of dawn creeps into the cave, Moonwatcher discovers that his father has died during the night. He did not know the Old One was his father, for such a relationship was beyond his understanding. but as he stands looking down at the emac- iated body he feels something, something akin to sadness. Then he carries his dead father out of the cave, and leaves him for the hyenas. 
Among his kind, Moonwatcher is almost a giant. He is nearly five feet high, and though badly undernourished, weighs over a hundred pounds. His hairy, muscular body is quite man-like, and his head is already nearer man than ape. The forehead is low, and there are great ridges over the eye-sockets, yet he unmistakably holds in his genes the promise of humanity. As he looks out now upon the hostile world, there is already

A2 CONTINUED 
something in his gaze beyond the grasp of any ape. In those dark, deep-set eyes is a dawning awareness-the first intima- tions of an intelligence which would not fulfill itself for another two million years. 
a3 
A3 EXT  THE STREAM - THE OTHERS 
As the dawn sky brightens, Moonwatcher and his tribe reach the shallow stream. 
The Others are already there. They were there on the other side every day - that did not make it any less annoying. 
There are eighteen of them, and it is impossible to distinguish them from the members of Moonwatcher's own tribe. As they see him coming, the Others begin to angrily dance and shriek on their side of the stream, and his own people reply In kind. 
The confrontation lasts a few minutes - then the display dies out as quickly as it has begun, and everyone drinks his fill of the muddy water. Honor has been satisfied - each group has staked its claim to its own territory. 
a4 
A4 EXT  AFRICAN PLAIN - HERBIVORES 
Moonwatcher and his companions search for berries, fruit and leaves, and fight off pangs of hunger, while all around them, competing with them for the samr fodder, is a potential source of more food than they could ever hope to eat. Yet all the thousands of tons of meat roaming over the parched savanna and through the brush is not only beyond their reach; the idea of eating it is beyond their imagination. They are slowly starving to death in the midst of plenty. 
a5 
A5 EXT  PARCHED COUNTRYSIDE - THE LION 
The tribe slowly wanders across the bare, flat country- side foraging for roots and occasional berries. 
Eight of them are irregularly strung out on the open plain, about fifty feet apart. 
The ground is flat for miles around. 
Suddenly, Moonwatcher becomes aware of a lion, stalking them about 300 yards away. 
Defenceless and with nowhere to hide, they scatter in all directions, but the lion brings one to the ground. 
a6 
Moonwatcher, who had been partly concealed by two males who walked before him, thrusts his arm high into the air. In his hand he holds a stoud tree branch. Mounted atop the branch is the bloody head of the lion, its mouth jammed open with a stick, displaying its frightful fangs. 
The Others gape in fearful disbelief at this display of power. 
Moonwatchers stands motionless, thrusting the lion's head high. Then with majestic deliberation, still carrying his mangled standard above his head, he begins to cross the stream, followed by his band. 
The Others fade back from the stream, seeming to lack even the ability to flee. 
Moonwatcher steps ashore and walks to One-Ear, who stands 
a25 
A14 CONTINUED 
unsurely in front of his band. 
Though he is a veteran of numerous combats at the water's edge, One-Ear has never been attacked by an enemy who had not first displayed his fighting rage; and he had never before been attacked with a weapon. One-Ear, merely looks up at the raised club until the heavey thigh bone of an antelope brings the darkness down around him. 
The Others stare in wonder at Moonwatcher's power. 
Moonwatcher surveys the scene. Now he was master of the world, and he was not sure what to do next. But he would think of something.

B13 CONTINUED PASSPORT GIRL (TV) (Interrupting)  Thank you. Despite and excellent and continually improving safety record there are certain risks inherent in space travel and an extremely high cost of pay load. Because of this it is necessary for the Space Carrier to advise you that it cannot be responsible for the return of your body to Earth should you become deceased on the Moon or en route to the Moon. However, it wishes to advise you that insurance covering this contingency is available in the Main Lounge. Thank you. You are cleared through Voice Print Identification.

B20 SPACE STATTION 5 - LOUNGE 
FLOYD Well, how nice to see you again, Elena. You're looking wonderful. 
ELENA How nice to see you, Hyewood. This is my good friend, Dr. Heywood Floyd. I'd like you to meet Andre Smyslov... 
SMYSLOV AND THE TWO OTHER RUSSIAN WOMEN STAND UP AND SMILE 
THEY SHAKE HANDS AFTER INTRODUCTION AND AD-LIB 'HELLOS' 
ELENA And this is Dr. Kalinan... Stretyneva... 
THE RUSSIANS ARE VERY WARM AND FRIENDLY. 
SMYSLOV Dr. Floyd, won't you join us for a drink? 
12/7/65										  b28 
B20 CONTINUED 
B20 CONTINUED 
FLOYD Well, I suppose they've been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment. 
SMYSLOV Yes, well at first we thought that was the explanation, but it's been going on for the past ten days. 
FLOYD You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days? 
SMYSLOV That's right. 
FLOYD I see. 
ELENA Another thing, Heywood, two days ago, one of our rocket buses was denied permission for an emergency landing at Clavius. 
12/7/65										  b33 
B20 CONTINUED 
FLOYD How did they manage to do that without any communication? 
ELENA Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal. 
FLOYD Well, that does sound very odd. 
SMYSLOV Yes, and I'm afaid there's going to be a bit of a row about it. Denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the I.A.S. convention. 
FLOYD Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely. 
SMYSLOV Fortunately, they did. 
FLOYD Well, I'm glad about that. 
12/7/65										  b33a 
B20 CONTINUED 
THE RUSSIANS EXCHANGE MORE GLANCES. ONE OF THE WOMEN OFFERS AROUND A PILL BOX. ELENA AND ANOTHER RUSSIAN TAKE ONE AND THE THIRD RUSSIAN DELCINES. 
SMYSLOV Dr. Floyd, at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss, may I ask you a straightforward question? 
FLOYD Certainly. 
SMYSLOV Quite frankly, we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that a quite serious epidemic has broken out at Clavius. Something, apperently, of an unknown origin. Is this, in fact, what has happened? 
A LONG, AWKWARD PAUSE 
12/7/65										  b33b 
B20 CONTINUED 
FLOYD I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but I'm really not at liberty to discuss this. 
SMYSLOV This epidemic could easily spread to our base, Dr. Floyd. We should be given all the facts. 
LONG PAUSE 
FLOYD Dr. Smyslov... I'm not permitted to discuss this. 
ELENA Are you sure you won't change your mind about a drink? 
FLOYD No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going. 
ELENA Well, I hope that you and your wife can come to the I.A.C. conference in June. 
12/7/65										  b33c 
CO-PILOT Well, whatever's going on up there, he's going to arrive fresh and ready to go. 
12/14/65										 b35 
B22 CONTINUED 
PILOT I wonder what really IS going on up there? 
CO-PILOT Well, I've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic. 
PILOT I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later. 
CO-PILOT Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight. 
PILOT Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week. 
CO-PILOT I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty. 
PILOT I'll bet it's a fortune. 
12/14/65										 b36 
B22 CONTINUED 
CO-PILOT Well, at ten thousand dollars a ticket, it comes to the better part of six hundred thousand dollars. 
PILOT Well, as soon as he wakes up, I'm going to go back and talk to him. I must say, I'd like to find out what's going on.

PILOT Well, good afternoon, Dr. Floyd. Did you have a good rest? 
FLOYD Oh, marvellous. It's the first real sleep I've had for the past two days. 
PILOT There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest. 
FLOYD When do we arrive at Clavius? 
PILOT We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you? 
FLOYD Oh, no, thank you. The two girls have taken wonderful care of me. I'm just fine. 
12/14/65										 b38 
B24 CONTINUED 
PILOT Well, if there is anything that you wnat, just give a holler. 
FLOYD Thank you. 
PILOT Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements? 
FLOYD What do you mean? 
PILOT Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours. And then we're going to back empty. 
FLOYD I see.

B36 CHILDREN IN SCHOOL. TEACHER SHOWING THEM VIEWS OF EARTH AND MAP OF EARTH. 
NARRATOR The personnel of the Base and their children were the forerunners of new nations, new cultures that would ultimately spread out across the solar system. They no longer thought of Earth as home. The time was fast approaching when Earth, like all mothers, must say farewell to her children.

FLOYD (voice echoing)  I must congratulate you Halvorsen. you've done wonder- ful things with the decor since the last time I was here. 
HALVORSEN (voice echoing)  Well... thank you, Dr. Floyd. We try to make the environment as earthlike as possible.

10/5/65										  b53 
B38 LOW CEILING CONFERENCE ROOM, "U" SHAPED TABLE FACING THREE PROJECTION SCREENS. SEATED AROUND THE TABLE ARE TWENTY SENIOR BASE PERSONNEL. 
HALVORSEN Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to introduce Dr. Heywood Floyd, a distinguished member of the National Council of Astronautics. He has just completed a special flight here from Earth to be with us, and before the briefing he would like to say a few words. Dr. Floyd. 
POLITE APPLAUSE. FLOYD WALKS TO FRONT OF ROOM. 
FLOYD First of all, I bring a personal message from Dr. Howell, who has asked me to convey his deepest appreciation to all of you for the personal sacrifices you have made, and of course his congratulations on your discovery which may well prove to be among the most significant in the history of science. 
POLITE APPLAUSE. 
11/25/65										 b54 
B38 CONTINUED 
FLOYD (cont'd) Mr. Halvorsen has made known to me some of the conflicting views held by many of you regarding the need for complete security in this matter, and more specifically your strong opposition to the cover story created to give the impression there is an epidemic at the Base. I understand that beyond it being a matter of principle, many of you are troubled by the concern and anxiety this story of an epidemic might cause your relatives and friends on Earth. 
I can understand and sympathize with your negative views. I have been personally embarrassed by this cover story. But I fully accept the need for absolute secrecy and I hope you will. 
It should not be difficult for all of you to realise the potential for cutural shock and social disorientation contained in the present situation if the facts were prematurely and suddenly made public without adequate preparation and conditioning. 
11/25/65										 b55 
B38 CONTINUED 
FLOYD This is the view of the Council and the purpose of my visit here is to gather addition facts and opinions on the situation and to prepare a report to the Council recommending when and how the news should eventually be announced. Are there any questions? 
MICHAELS Dr. Floyd, how long do you think this can be kept under wraps? 
FLOYD (pleasantly) I'm afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the Council. And of course you know that the Council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every- one who had any knowledge of this event. There must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con- sideration can be given to making a public announcement. 
11/25/65										 b63 
B44 CONTINUED 
MICHAELS might do something, but we don't want to be too rough until we know a little more. 
FLOYD But you don't have any idea as to what it is? 
MICHAELS Tomb, shine, survey-marker spare part, take your choice. 
HALVORSEN The only thing about it that we are sure of is that it is the first direct evidence of intelligent life beyond the Earth. 
SILENT APPRECIATION 
HALVORSEN Four million years ago, something, presumably from the stars, must have swept through the solar system and left this behind. 
11/25/65										 b64 
B44 CONTINUED 
FLOYD Was it abandoned, forgotten, left for a purpose? 
HALVORSEN I suppose we'll never know. 
MICHAELS The moon would have made an excellent base camp for preliminary Earth surveys. 
SOME MORE SILENCE 
FLOYD Any ideas about the colour? 
MICHAELS Well, not really. At first glance, black would suggest something sun-powered, but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device? 
FLOYD Has it been exposed to any sun before now? 
MICHAELS I don't think it has, but I'd like to check that. Simpson, what's the log on that? 
11/25/65										 b65 
B45 INSIDE MONITOR DOME WE SEE A NUMBER OF TELEVISION DISPLAYS INCLUDING SEVERAL TV VIEWS OF FLOYD AND COMPANY IN THE EXCAVATION. 
SIMPSON The first surface was exposed at 0843 on the 12th April... Let me see... that would have been forty-five minutes after Lunar sun-set. I see here that special lighting equipment had to be brought up before any futher work could be done. 
11/25/65										 b66 
B46 TMA-1 EXCAVATION 
MICHAELS Thank you. 
FLOYD And so this is the first sun that it's had in four million years. 
PHOTOGRAPHER Excuse me, gentlemen, if you'd all line up on this side of the walkway we'd like to take a few photographes. Dr. Floyd, would you thand in the middle... Dr. Michaels on that side, Mr. Halvorsen on the other.... thank you. 
THE PHOTOGRAPHER QUICKLY MAKES SOME EXPOSURES 
PHOTOGRAPHER Thank you very much gentlemen, I'll have the base photo section send you copies. 
AS THE MEN SLOWLY SEPERATE FROM THEIR PICTURE POSE, THERE IS A PIERCINGLY POWERFUL SERIES OF FIVE ELECTRONIC SHRIEKS, EACH LIKE A HIDEOUSLY OVER-LOADED AND DISTORTED TIME SIGNAL. FLOYD INVOLUNTARILY TRIES TO BLOCK HIS EARS WITH HIS SPACESUITED HANDS. THEN COMES MERCIFUL SILENCE.

NARRATOR Radiation detectors noted and analyzed incoming cosmic rays from the galaxy and points beyond; neutron and x-ray telescopes kept watch on strange stars that no human eye would eever see; magnetometers observed the gusts and hurricanes of the solar winds, as the sun breathed million mile-an-hour blasts of plasma into the faces of its circling children.

BOWMAN I suppose computers have been known to be wrong. 
POOLE Yes, but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low. 
BOWMAN Anyway, it's just as well that we replace it. Better safe than sorry.

BOWMAN (softly) What the hell is going on? 
POOLE I don't know. Hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure. 
BOWMAN Two units in four days. How many spares do we have? 
POOLE Two more. 
BOWMAN Well, I hope there's nothing wrong with the assembly on those. Other- wise we're out of business.

C72 COMMUNICATIONS AREA. 
MISSION CONTROL I wouldn't worry too much about the computer. First of all, there is still a chance that he is right, despite your tests, and if it should happen again, we suggest eliminating this possibility by allowing the unit to remain in place and seeing whether or not it actually fails. 
If the computer should turn out to be wrong, the situation is still not alarming. The type of obsessional error he may be guilty of is not unknown among the latest generation of HAL 9000 computers. 
It has almost always revolved around a single detail, such as the one you have described, and it has never interfered with the integrity or reliability of the computer's performance in other areas. 
No one is certain of the cause of this kind of malfunctioning. It may be over-programming, (con't)

BOWMAN X-ray-delta-zero to MC, zero- five-three-three. The computer has just reported another predicted failure off the AAC- unit. As you suggested, we are going to wait and see if it fails, but we are quite sure there is nothing wrong with the unit. 
If a reasonable waiting period proves us to be correct, we feel now that the computer reliability has been seriously impaired, and presents an unacceptable risk pattern to the mission. 
We believe, under these circumstances, it would be advisable to disconnect the computer from all ship operations and continue the mission under Earth-based computer control.

BOWMAN (con't) We think the additional risk caused by the ship-to-earth time lag is preferable to having an unreliable on-board computer.

HAL I suppose it's because you've been under a lot of stress, but have you forgotten that they're not supposed to be revived for another three months. 
BOWMAN The antenna has to be replaced. 
HAL Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation. 
BOWMAN It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please. 
HAL I don't really agree with you, Dave. My on-board memory store is more than capable of handling all the mission requirements. 
12/14/65										 c103 
C118 CONTINUED 
BOWMAN Well, in any event, give me the manual hibernation control. 
HAL If you're determined to revive the crew now, I can handle the whole thing myself. There's no need for you to trouble. 
BOWMAN I'm goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please. 
HAL Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me. 
BOWMAN Hal, switch to manual hibernation control. 
HAL I don't like to assert myself, Dave, but it would be much better now for you to rest. You've been involved in a very stressful situation. 
12/14/65										 c104 
C118 CONTINUED 
BOWMAN I don't feel like resting. Give me the control, Hal. 
HAL I can tell from the tone of your voice, Dave, that you're upset. Why don't you take a stress pill and get some rest. 
BOWMAN Hal, I'm in command of this ship. I order you to release the manual hibernation control. 
HAL I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it. 
BOWMAN Hal, unless you follow my instructions, I shall be forced to disconnect you. 
12/14/65										 c105 
C118 CONTINUED 
HAL If you do that now without Earth contact the ship will become a helpless derelict. 
BOWMAN I am prepared to do that anyway. 
HAL I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission. 
BOWMAN Listen to me very carefully, Hal. Unless you immediately release the hibernation control and follow every order I give from this point on, I will immediately got to control central and carry out a complete disconnection. 
12/14/65										 c106 
C118 CONTINUED 
HAL Look, Dave, you're certainly the boss. I was only trying to do what I thought best. I will follow all your orders: now you have manual hibernation control.

MISSION CONTROL Lastly, we want you to know that work on the recovery vehicle is still on schedule and that nothing that has happened should substantially lessen the probability of your safe recovery, or prevent partial achevement of some of the mission objectives. (pause) And now Simonson has a few ideas on what went wrong with the computer. I'll pu him on... 
FLOYD (con't) radiation in the radio spectrum which seems to have triggered by the Lunar sunrise. 
Luckily for those at the site, it proved harmless. 
Perhaps you can imagine our astonishment when we later found it was aimed precisely at Saturn. A lot of thought went into the question of wether or not it was sun-triggered, as it seemed illogical to deliberately bury a sun-powered device. 
Burying it could only shield it from the sun, since its intense magnetic field made it otherwise easily detectable. 
We finally concluded that the only reason you might bury a sun- powered device would be to keep it inactive until it would be uncovered, at which time it would absorb sunlight and trigger itself. (con't) 
12/14/65										 c125 
C150 CONTINUED 
FLOYD What is its purpose?  I wish we knew. The object was buried on the moon about four million years ago, when our ancestors were primative man-apes. 
We've examined dozens of theories, but the one that has the most currency at the moment is that the object serves as an alarm. 
What the purpose of the alarm is, why they wish to have the alarm, whether the alarm represents any danger to us?  These are questions no one can answer. The intentions of an alien world, at least four million years older than we are, cannot be reliably predicted. 
In view of this, the intelligence and scientific communities felt that any public announcment might lead to significant cultural shock and disorientation. 
Discussion took place at the highest levels between govern- (con't) 
12/14/65										 c126 
C150 CONTINUED 
FLOYD (con't) ments, and it was decided that the only wise and precautionary course to follow was to assume that the intentions of this alien world are potentially dangerous to us, until we have evidence to the contrary. 
This is, of course, why security has been maintained and why this information has been kept on a need-to-know basis. 
And now I should like to show you a TV monitor tape of the actual signalling event.

D1 CONTINUED NARRATOR (con't) Those who had begun the expri- ment so long ago had not been men. 
But when they looked out across the deeps of space, they felt awe and wonder - and loneliness. 
In their explorations, they encountered life in many forms, and watched on a thousand worlds the workings of evolution. 
They saw how often the first faint sparks of intelligence flickered and died in the cosmic night. 
And because, in all the galaxy, they had found nothing more precious than Mind, they encouraged its dawning every- where. 
The great Dinosaurs had long since perished when their ships entered the solar system, after a voyage that had already lasted thousands of years.

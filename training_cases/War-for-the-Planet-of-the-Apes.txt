FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT NOVEMBER 30, 2015 
BLACK SCREEN 
PRIMITIVE WAR DRUMS POUND OMINOUSLY... as a LEGEND BEGINS: 
Fifteen years ago, a scientific experiment gone wrong gave RISE to a species of intelligent apes... and destroyed most of humanity with a virus that became known as the Simian Flu. 
The word "RISE" lingers, moving toward us as it FADES... 
With the DAWN of a new ape civilization led by Caesar, the surviving humans struggled to coexist... but fighting finally broke out when a rebel ape, Koba, led a vengeful attack against the humans. 
The word "DAWN" lingers, moving toward us as it FADES... 
The humans sent a distress call to a military base in the North where all that remained of the U.S. Army was gathered. A ruthless Special Forces Colonel and his hardened battalion were dispatched to exterminate the apes. Evading capture for the last two years, Caesar is now rumored to be marshaling the fight from a hidden command base in the woods... as the WAR rages on... 
The word "WAR" lingers, moving toward us... TURNING RED as the REST OF THE TITLE FADES UP and the DRUMS ABRUPTLY STOP: 
WAR FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES 
We HEAR sounds of nature. Then the quiet SNAPPING OF TWIGS. BOOTS CRUNCHING stealthily through grass. HUSHED BREATHING. 
HARD CUT TO: 
TIGHT CREEPING STEADICAM BEHIND THE HELMETS OF HUMAN SOLDIERS 
Scrawled on the helmet closest to us are the words "MONKEY KILLER." Others pass through frame: "BEDTIME FOR BONZO," "ENDANGERED SPECIES"... The SOLDIERS climb slowly up -- 
A STEEP, DENSELY WOODED HILL 
The troops wear threadbare camo fatigues, dark camo paint on their faces; each bears the hand-drawn insignia "A" on their bodies: some on their uniforms, some tattooed on their arms. Many carry GUNS, others MILITARY-GRADE CROSSBOWS. 
One of the men comes to a halt, quickly WHISPERS: 
SOLDIER Captain...! 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
The CAPTAIN holds up a hand, signalling the unit to stop. He joins the Soldier, who points up ahead. The Captain peers THROUGH HIS GUN SITE to see -- 
THREE APES AND THEIR HORSES 
up on a ridge 100 yards away. Two of the APES stand guard furtively, one clutching a spear, the other an automatic rifle -- while the third waters the horses at a stream. 
The Captain lines up his cross-hairs... when ANOTHER SOLDIER creeps right up behind him, reaching for him... but as the hand lifts into frame, we see -- it's an APE HAND... 
The ape hand GRABS the Captain's shoulder; startled, he quickly turns -- and the ape soldier (RED) POINTS up to -- 
THE CANOPY OF TREES OVERHEAD -- where another HELMETED APE crouches, hidden, looking down at them -- the ape in the tree POINTS toward the ridge... The Captain follows the gesture to a LONG, LOW TRENCH WALL of logs and stones, disguised behind leaves and branches. 
Captain turns back to Red, nods; WHISPERS INTO HIS HEADSET: 
CAPTAIN Echo two-six to command. Colonel, we have eyes on three Kong in the north woods. A couple of our donkeys think there are others here too... Maybe this is it, maybe the base is near. (listens carefully) Yes sir... Yes sir, copy. Over. 
He clicks off, quickly waves up more soldiers from the rear. They begin pulling weapons and ammo from heavy rucksacks that Red and TWO OTHER APE SOLDIERS carry on their backs. The apes seem subservient, treated as no more than pack-mules. 
CAPTAIN (CONT'D) You!   Over here! 
An ape scurries over; the Captain pulls out a grenade launcher -- turns to the men: 
CAPTAIN (CONT'D) Preacher... 
PREACHER, a fresh-faced grunt still in his teens, crawls up nervously with his CROSSBOW; the Captain points at the three apes up on the ridge: 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) 
CAPTAIN (CONT'D) The one with the gun... 
Preacher NODS as the Captain readies his own weapon, lining up on the partially-hidden trench wall. Beside them, soldiers are sliding BAYONET BLADES onto their rifles... 
All eyes on the Captain as he counts down silently with his fingers. "3... 2... 1" -- 
-- and Preacher fires an arrow into the ape with the gun! 
The other two apes are just starting to react -- when the Captain sends two grenades screaming across the woods... BLASTING OPEN the trench wall -- 
-- and suddenly SCORES OF STUNNED APES begin chaotically FALLING out from the trench behind it! They TUMBLE off- balance, dropping weapons (guns, spears, bows & arrows) as -- 
THE HUMANS OPEN FIRE, picking them off in a hail of bullets, arrows, and grenades. The two apes by the stream jump on their horses, starting to flee, when a SNIPER takes one out! But the APE WITH THE SPEAR manages to escape, SCREECHING in warning as he disappears into the distance. 
The Captain turns to Preacher and the other men, waving them on -- we can't even hear his voice over the DIN OF BATTLE: 
CAPTAIN (CONT'D) (COME ON!!) 
The humans charge up the hill, continuing their assault -- 
A TRACKING POV SHOT - MOMENTS LATER 
The battle's grim aftermath, an almost surreal vision of the ravages of war. Apes scavenge for weapons, stripping GUNS AND AMMUNITION off the bodies of fallen human soldiers... WE CONTINUE MOVING TOWARD A TRENCH, where APE BODIES are being lifted out and SCORES OF WOUNDED attended to... as we get closer, apes in the recess below look slowly up at us with reverence... We move DOWN INTO THE TRENCH, more and more apes reacting, nudging each other, alerting everyone to our arrival, even the injured raise their heads... 
REVEAL CAESAR 
as he strides through the trench; the POV was his. He looks older now, but even more imposing. His hardened expression reveals nothing... but in his eyes we see deep pain, as he takes in the terrible loss and suffering... 
He's trailed by TWO GORILLAS, flanking him on either side: his grizzled lieutenant LUCA and a younger, smaller ALBINO (WINTER), who looks overwhelmed by the carnage around them... 
The three of them finally arrive at an area UNDER earth cover, where they find A GROUP OF HUMAN SOLDIERS on their knees, helmets lowered, hands bound behind their backs. Spear and other ape warriors stand guard. Seeing Caesar, Spear supplicates deferentially. 
Caesar turns to the prisoners as they lift their frightened eyes to his. We see Preacher among them. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
But one soldier's helmet is still lowered. Spear reaches down and yanks the helmet off -- revealing Red. Red defiantly avoids Caesar's gaze. 
Spear tosses the helmet to Caesar. Caesar examines it, sees the hand-drawn "A." He looks at the other soldiers, notices the same symbol crudely tattooed on one of the soldiers' arms, sees it scrawled on some of the uniforms. His eyes find it again on the front of Preacher's helmet. 
PREACHER (nervous, quiet) ...it's... Alpha Omega. 
Caesar just stares; then LANG, a lean female soldier, "A" tattooed on her neck, speaks, quiet defiance under her fear: 
LANG Means we're the beginning and end. Humanity's survival depends on us. 
Just then, the apes around Caesar turn, reacting to the arrival of -- 
MAURICE, the orangutan. Like Caesar, he's older; there's a weariness in his eyes that suggests the war has taken a toll on his gentle spirit. Caesar turns to his old friend. 
MAURICE (signs gravely) [Twenty-two dead. Many more injured.] 
Caesar glowers at the soldiers. We see Preacher still staring up at him... finally getting up the courage to utter: 
PREACHER You're him... You're Caesar. 
Caesar's eyes go to Preacher, caught off guard. 
PREACHER (CONT'D) We've been looking for you for so long. We heard you had a hidden command base, but we could never find it. Some of us were starting to think you might be dead. But Colonel McCullough said no, you were out here somewhere... 
Caesar doesn't respond, just keeps glaring at the soldiers. Another soldier (TRAVIS) speaks up -- nerves frayed: 
TRAVIS Just kill us already... 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) 
LANG Shut up, man -- 
TRAVIS What? They're animals, he's gonna slaughter us -- 
Caesar slowly steps toward him... Travis falls silent. 
And at last CAESAR SPEAKS, a dark edge in his voice: 
CAESAR I... did not start this war. 
The humans all hold their breath, gaping up at him. 
CAESAR (CONT'D) The ape who did... is dead. His name was Koba. I killed him. (then, harder) I only fight now... to protect apes. 
TRAVIS (steeling himself) Yeah? What about him? (glances at Red) And we got ten more just like him. 
CAESAR I know these apes. They followed Koba... (looks Red dead in the eye) They tried to kill me. They fear what I will do to them. They believe I cannot forgive. So now they serve you... just to survive. 
Red glares up at Caesar -- and for the first time he unexpectedly SPEAKS in PRIMITIVE, BASTARDIZED LANGUAGE: 
RED I no fear you! You must fear! How long you think woods can protect you? Humans destroy you. Their Kerna has all power. Humans follow all he say. To them, he more than just human. He everything. 
He looks over the apes, who seem chilled... his eyes boring into Winter's; the young gorilla is unnerved -- 
RED (CONT'D) He say: first Caesar die... then you all die. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (3) 
Spear ERUPTS, hurling Red to the ground -- when Caesar puts a hand up. Spear restrains himself, eyes still blazing. Caesar looks to Luca, then signs: 
CAESAR [Get him out of here.] 
Luca turns to Winter. Winter gathers himself, then drags a resisting Red away. The humans watch, fearful... then turn to Caesar, awaiting their fate... Luca signs, ominously: 
LUCA [What should we do with them?] 
CUT TO: 
BOUND HUMAN WRISTS, AS APE HANDS CINCH A KNOT TIGHT -- 
REVEAL PREACHER, LANG, TRAVIS, AND THE OTHER TWO SOLDIERS on a pair of horses, their hands now TIED to the reins. Apes on the ground surround them. Preacher looks at Caesar. 
PREACHER You're letting us live...? 
CAESAR Tell your Colonel... you have seen me now. And I have a message for him: this fighting can stop. Leave us the woods. And no more humans will die. 
The soldiers look at him, fear and defiance in their eyes. Caesar nods to Luca -- who SWATS the horses' hindquarters, sending them on their way. The stunned humans peer back at the apes as the horses carry them off. 
INT. HIDDEN FORTRESS - COUNCIL ROOM - SHORT TIME LATER 
CAESAR'S SYMBOL carved into the stone floor; around the symbol sit Caesar and Cornelia, Blue Eyes, Lake, Rocket, Maurice, Luca, Winter and other COUNCIL MEMBERS. 
A MAP is laid out on the floor; Cornelius presses his face close, watching Blue Eyes' finger as it points to one spot in particular: 
BLUE EYES (passionately, to Caesar) [This is it, Father. We can start over. A new home.] 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
Cornelia scoops Cornelius into her lap, gently pulling him away from the map -- she looks at Blue Eyes, intrigued, points: 
CORNELIA [What is beyond those mountains, son?] 
Blue Eyes picks up a pouch beside him and digs his hand in, removing a fistful of SAND; he spills it out dramatically -- 
BLUE EYES [A desert, Rocket and I had to cross it too. The journey is long, but that is why humans will not find us.] 
Cornelia smiles, nodding -- she and Caesar exchange a proud look -- when Winter cuts in anxiously: 
WINTER [We must leave tonight!] 
LAKE [Tonight?    That's impossible!] 
WINTER [How much longer can we wait?      Soldiers are getting closer!] 
BLUE EYES (touching Winter's arm) [Winter...] 
Winter shrugs him off -- Luca and the others all erupt angrily at Winter -- Caesar stands imposingly. Winter immediately lowers his head, afraid; then, to Caesar: 
WINTER [Your son's been gone, he doesn't know how hard it's been!] 
BLUE EYES [I know you are scared, we all are, but we are still planning...] 
CAESAR Yes... We must still find a way to get out of the woods safely. 
Everyone looks at Caesar as he sits. 
CAESAR (CONT'D) There were two of you. But we are many. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) 
MAURICE (concurring) [The woods are filled with soldiers.] 
Everyone falls silent.   Blue Eyes meets Caesar's gaze: 
BLUE EYES Father... We must try. 
Caesar looks at his son, emotional: 
CAESAR I know, son. (he turns to the others) More apes die everyday. And we cannot hide here much longer. 
Caesar looks back down at the map, deep in thought; then feels the anxious stares of the apes around him. He looks at them, trying to reassure, though he is still uncertain himself: 
CAESAR (CONT'D) We will find a way out... 
He raises his fists and brings them together, solemn: 
CAESAR (CONT'D) Apes together strong. 
They return the gesture, nodding faithfully at their leader. 
INT. HIDDEN FORTRESS - CAESAR'S DWELLING - NIGHT 
A small cave in the upper levels of the fortress, enclosed on one side by the ROARING FALLS. Caesar sits up, awake, as his family sleeps around him. Troubled, he studies Blue Eyes' map in his lap -- when suddenly he feels something... 
Caesar looks down to see Cornelius instinctively hugging his leg as he rests, nuzzled beside his mother. Caesar gazes down protectively at his little one, strokes his head, then turns to look back at the map -- when he notices Blue Eyes staring up at him through heavy lidded eyes. 
BLUE EYES [Can't sleep?] 
Caesar shakes his head, his worried gaze returning to the map. Finally, Blue Eyes reaches out and touches his father's arm; Caesar turns. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
BLUE EYES (CONT'D) [Trust me, father. This is a risk worth taking.] 
Moved, Caesar nods; he reaches out and gratefully caresses his son's face, then SIGNS, smiling: 
CAESAR [I am so proud of you.] (then) [I love you, son.] 
-- when suddenly a SHIMMERING GREEN LIGHT washes briefly over both their faces... 
Startled, Caesar looks up at the falls to SEE -- 
-- THREE SHAPES distorted surreally in the water, each haloed in green light as they descend rapidly from view. 
Unnerved, Caesar sits up, unsure of what he's just seen. Blue Eyes watches as his father approaches the falls warily, moving in very close... when Caesar sees a STRANGE THIN LINE, whipping about in the current...? 
He reaches toward THE LINE, mystified -- then plunges his arm deep in the water, grasping for it -- 
-- he pulls the line toward him... revealing a taut section of RED NYLON CLIMBING ROPE, straining against the current... 
Alarmed, Caesar immediately turns back to Blue Eyes and signs, urgent: 
HANDHELD SHOT - PEEKING THROUGH THE TREES 
As we move closer, we discover we are at the edge of -- 
A DESERTED R.V. PARK 
Old campers lined up, long-since abandoned. Smoke billows from a weathered stovepipe poking through the window of a rusted-out Airstream trailer. The only sign of life. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
REVERSE ON CAESAR, MAURICE, ROCKET AND LUCA 
spying through the trees on foot, looking apprehensive. They exchange uncertain looks -- could this be the base camp? They creep out of the trees for a closer look -- when -- 
A LONE MAN carrying firewood emerges from the forest. 
He's mid-40s, dirty, unshaven. Seeing the apes, he stops in his tracks. They all stare, a silent stand-off... Then, very, very slowly, he starts to lower his pile of wood: 
MAN I'm just gonna... put this down -- 
He drops the wood suddenly, revealing a RIFLE strapped to his shoulder -- he whips it around -- and FIRES! The shot JUST MISSES MAURICE, when -- 
BANG!   THE MAN DROPS DEAD.   Stunned, the apes turn to see -- 
CAESAR clutching his SMOKING GUN, staring distantly at the man he's just killed. The others regard Caesar's grim, steady presence, a bit in shock at his seeming lack of remorse; a look in his eyes suggests even he knows something has broken within him. A line has been crossed. 
Finally, Caesar lowers his rifle -- only now aware of their stares. He turns away, ignoring them, steps toward the man. 
The others join him, looking down at the body. The tattered rags he wears are barely recognizable as the fatigues worn by the human soldiers. "A" is crudely tattooed on his arm. 
LUCA [Is he out here alone?] 
ROCKET [Maybe he's a deserter?] 
Caesar doesn't respond, eyes on the dead man -- when a MUTED CRASH comes from behind; they all turn to THE AIRSTREAM... 
CUT TO: 
BLACKNESS 
Suddenly a door is ripped open, and light spills in; we are -- 
INT. RUSTED-OUT AIRSTREAM - DOORWAY - MOMENTS LATER 
The faces of the apes slowly appear, gazing warily in at us; Caesar and Rocket have their guns drawn. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
They stalk silently into the dim space, eyes roaming... It's long and narrow, lined with rotted wood panelling, packed and littered with improvised survivalist essentials. 
We MOVE with them as Caesar leads the group through the claustrophobic interior, anxiously scanning for any place a human might be hiding... Moving inexorably toward... 
A CLOSED DOOR 
at the far end of the trailer. The others exchange tense looks as Caesar readies his gun -- and SMASHES down the door! 
ON CAESAR, eyes blazing, furiously training his gun as he sees something; he freezes, poised to kill, and we REVEAL -- 
A LITTLE GIRL 
cowering like a frightened animal against the wall in a lower bunk bed. She looks no more than 8 or 9 years old. A little waif-like figure, her unwashed face is framed by wildly matted hair. She stares wide-eyed up at -- 
Caesar, gun still trained on her, adrenaline coursing through his veins... The faces of the other apes appear behind him, shocked at what they see. 
Finally, Maurice reaches over, places a hand on Caesar's gun, gently lowers it. Caesar returns to his senses... but still shows no compassion for the human child. He turns away, to the others, gesturing coldly at the trailer behind them: 
CAESAR Look around. Take what we can use. 
Caesar steps out past them; Rocket and Luca share an uneasy look, then follow. 
But Maurice remains, eyeing the scared little Girl with a mixture of curiosity and pity. He spots something on the floor by the bed, starts to move toward it... 
Terrified, the Girl scoots back against the wall, withdrawing as far as she can. But Maurice coos a comforting pant-hoot as he reaches down to the floor and retrieves -- 
A CRUDELY-MADE RAG DOLL. He holds it out. She hesitates -- then quickly grabs it and retreats to her corner, hugging it. 
Maurice watches her, then raises his arm, reaching for her. She freezes, nervous eyes following his enormous hand... as his finger straightens... and gently strokes the doll's head. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) 
She blinks up, studying him, fear ebbing; she opens her mouth to speak, but no words come, just GENTLE, GASPING GRUNTS... 
CUT TO: 
A DUSTY COMPASS IN A BATTERED OLD LOCKBOX 
REVEAL LUCA picking it up, as he, Caesar and Rocket search the trailer. Luca sees a PAIR OF BINOCULARS in the box; he takes them too, along with some FLASHLIGHTS. 
Impatient, Caesar looks back, wondering where Maurice is -- when Maurice appears in the doorway, the Girl visible behind him, staring out curiously. Maurice signs to Caesar: 
MAURICE [Something wrong with her.   I don't think she can speak.] 
Caesar looks coldly at the Girl, then back to Maurice: 
BOYLE Shut up, Preacher -- what're you, a donkey lover now? I think you going soft coz that kong let you go. 
Some of the soldiers snicker. Preacher backs down, humiliated and angry. Boyle levels his gun at Winter again. 
BOYLE (CONT'D) Get me a new bowl. 
Winter looks nervously to Red.       Red nods soberly: do it. 
INT. DARKENED MOBILE KITCHEN TENT - MOMENTS LATER 
Winter digs under a supply table for a new bowl. Rising, he catches his reflection in a grimy mirror over a wash basin. He hesitates, maybe suffering a crisis of conscience -- when he sees A REFLECTED FACE lurking in the shadows behind him! 
He spins to see CAESAR standing there, motionless, staring... 
Panicked, Winter turns for the exit -- but LUCA is there, blocking escape. Turns the other way -- and there's ROCKET. Winter's eyes widen as Caesar takes a slow step toward him... 
CAESAR Where is the Colonel? 
Winter swallows, trembling as he lifts his hands to sign: 
WINTER [He's gone.] 
CAESAR (dubious, stalking closer) ...Gone? 
Winter looks at the other apes, sees them closing in too... Turns back to Caesar, nervously explaining: 
WINTER [This morning. He took many soldiers with him.] 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
Luca and Rocket exchange troubled glances... but Caesar's eyes remain fixed on Winter as he continues his approach... 
WINTER (CONT'D) [Men are coming down here ­- from their base in the north. The Colonel and his soldiers are going to meet them at the border.] 
CAESAR What border? Why? 
WINTER [I don't know. But more of us are leaving to join them in the morning. Red thinks they'll all be coming back here... to help the Colonel finish off the apes for good.] 
Caesar finally stops, right in front of him.    Winter pleads: 
WINTER (CONT'D) [Please... I know I betrayed you. But can't you see? We'll never beat them. I was just trying to survive. Red told me the humans promised to spare us if we helped. I beg you, forgive me...] 
But Caesar is unmoved, barely stifling his rage... 
CAESAR My son... my wife... are dead. 
Just then -- we hear the LAUGHTER OF HUMANS outside; Winter turns, sees SHADOWS OF SOLDIERS passing on the side of the tent -- he opens his mouth to shriek to them -- but a HAND CLAMPS over his mouth, as Caesar wrestles him to the ground to silence him! The others rush in, holding Winter down as he struggles violently, desperately trying to shriek out -- 
The SHADOWS OF THE SOLDIERS HALT, their laughter subsiding as their heads turn toward the muffled sounds in the tent -- 
Seeing this, Caesar furiously tightens his grip around Winter's neck -- but Winter won't stop, struggling even harder! Eyes fixed on the human shadows, Caesar grips fiercely... choking tighter and tighter... 
...until Winter finally relents. Caesar watches the shadows, tense... And at last, they move on. 
The apes exhale relief. Luca and Rocket turn to Caesar -- but their eyes drift to Winter. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) 
Caesar follows their looks down to the young gorilla in his grasp... and discovers he has killed him. 
Stunned, he stares at Winter's lifeless face... then, slowly, looks up again at Luca and Rocket, grappling with what he's done. They lower their eyes. 
EXT. DENSE WOODS - NIGHT 
Tense silence. The apes and Girl sit by a fire, isolated in the trees; Maurice studies Caesar's face as he gazes into the flames, deeply unsettled. Then Maurice turns to the others, who look equally plagued. Finally, Rocket turns to Maurice: 
ROCKET [Winter had it coming!] 
Maurice nods, uneasy; Luca looks up, convincing himself: 
LUCA [Caesar had no choice!] 
MAURICE [So what do we do now?] 
ROCKET [Wait for the soldiers to leave.   Follow them to the Colonel.] 
Maurice turns again to Caesar, who is still in his own world, lifting a gourd canteen to his lips. He takes a drink... when, out of the corner of his eye, he sees the Girl beside him, staring at him guilelessly. 
He looks at her askance for a moment, deadpan, then hands her the gourd, and she guzzles thirstily. Caesar watches -- 
-- when suddenly his eyes shift, startled to discover a DARK FIGURE on the other side of the fire... 
Alarmed and bewildered, Caesar peers through the flames... amazed to see it's AN APE sitting across from him, his head lowered ominously. Fire dances on Caesar's pupils as he stares at the figure, haunted... 
...when suddenly, the Ape lifts his face, grinning at Caesar through the distorting waves of heat -- Caesar looks haunted: 
CAESAR ...Koba? 
KOBA Ape... not kill ape... 
TIGHT ON CAESAR 
snapping awake with a start -- we are -- 
BAD APE (nods) Listen to human... 
His face abruptly contorts into an "angry human" expression -- he waves a chiding finger as he mimics: 
BAD APE (CONT'D) "Bad ape!    Bad ape!" 
Then, turning his head, he realizes the Girl has the shiny Chevy Nova emblem again -- he reaches for it, possessive: 
BAD APE (CONT'D) (gently admonishes) No... No touch. 
She stares at it longingly as he sets it down. He looks back at the apes, smiles -- then rushes away for something else... 
The apes all watch their excitable host, perplexed -- Maurice turns to Caesar, signs an aside: 
MAURICE [Amazing... Always thought we were the only ones. Wonder if there are others out there somewhere? Others like us.] 
Just as Caesar begins to contemplate the mind-blowing thought, Bad Ape bounds back in, hurriedly passing out packages of vacuum-foiled food rations (M.R.E.'s). 
BAD APE Here! Eat, eat! (beaming) New friends. Special day. 
Bad Ape tears the top off one, starts eating the dehydrated food, nodding encouragingly for them to do the same. 
Caesar looks slowly down at the ration in his hand -- notices an official military seal: "U.S. GOVERNMENT PROPERTY: CA STATE BORDER QUARANTINE DETENTION AND RELOCATION CENTER" CUT TIGHTER on the word: BORDER. Caesar suddenly looks up: 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (3) 
CAESAR Where did you get this? 
Bad Ape turns to him, confused. Caesar holds up the package. Bad Ape looks uneasy... his voice lowering to a hush: 
BAD APE Bad place. Very bad. I find. Long time ago. After zoo. Looking for food. Find human zoo. Zoo for sick. 
Engrossed, Caesar's eyes meet his... as Bad Ape continues: 
BAD APE (CONT'D) Big walls. Sick humans try climb. Bad humans kill. Then get sick too. All dead now. All dead. 
Caesar and the others take this in, somehow haunted.   Then: 
CAESAR Bad humans...? Soldiers? 
Bad Ape recognizes the word, nods gravely: 
BAD APE Soldiers. 
The posse looks to each other with rising intensity... 
ROCKET [An old, deserted military camp on the border...?] 
LUCA [Maybe this is where the Colonel and the troops from the north are going to meet?] 
Caesar nods: maybe.    He turns back to Bad Ape. 
CAESAR Is it far?     Can you take us? 
BAD APE (looks agog) Human zoo?! No... No go back there. Everyone dead. I come here. Safe here. Never go back! 
Caesar reaches out his hand, places it on Bad Ape's shoulder: 
CAESAR Please.     You must take us. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (4) 
BAD APE No!     Can not take!   Can not take! 
Scared, he pushes Caesar's hand from his shoulder, a little too hard -- Rocket GRABS him, incensed ­- but Caesar restrains Rocket, shakes his head no. Bad Ape shrinks in Rocket's grasp -- then sees something, and points desperately to the little windows along the wall -- 
BAD APE (CONT'D) Look! More snow! Can not go, must stay here. (to the others) Look, look! 
They all look to the massive lobby window to see it is indeed snowing hard now. 
Rocket finally releases Bad Ape.     He exhales, looks at them with renewed optimism. 
BAD APE (CONT'D) You stay here. Eat. Rest. (smiles hopefully) With me. 
Caesar considers, reluctantly nods to the others. Bad Ape is relieved -- when he sees the Girl staring longingly again at the Nova emblem; he grabs it, hands it to her ceremoniously: 
BAD APE (CONT'D) Here.    You keep. 
He looks around, smiling at the apes for approval; the Girl gazes happily at the emblem, as with a WHISTLING HOWL, we -- 
CUT TO: 
HIGH OVER THE CAVERNOUS LOBBY - MIDDLE OF NIGHT 
Snow whirling hard through the ice palace.        HOLD; CUT TO: 
NEAR THE HEARTH - SAME 
The last embers of the fire dying out as everyone sleeps... 
CLOSE ON CAESAR 
The only one still awake.    He sits up, eyes settling on -- 
The group have left the trail, moving through dense forest. 
Caesar watches Bad Ape who peers anxiously ahead... to where SUNLIGHT spills in at the edge of the woods. Bad Ape turns to meet Caesar's eyes, fearful: 
BAD APE There... 
Caesar looks at the light, then turns to the others, raising his hand for them to stop. 
CUT TO: 
EDGE OF THE WOODS - MOMENTS LATER 
On foot now, the group presses in close behind the trees at the forest's perimeter, squinting into the hard, low sun at -- 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
AN ENORMOUS CANYON BELOW THEM 
Steep, snow-covered granite cliffs slope down in shelves, disappearing into an unseen expanse below. 
The TOP OF A MASSIVE, PRISON-STYLE WARDEN'S TOWER pokes ominously up in the distance, from the center of the chasm. 
Caesar raises the binoculars, PEERING AT THE TOWER: sun flares off the cement and steel structure, stained with corrosion. Through the windows, it appears to be DESERTED. 
Caesar lowers the glasses, staring uncertainly -- when he notices something about the FADED CALIFORNIA STATE FLAG hanging from the tower -- he looks through the binoculars to examine it: the flag is hung upside-down... and a HUGE "A" has been painted in black across it. 
Then Caesar suddenly notices movement down below -- he shifts the glasses to find TINY SILHOUETTED FIGURES, just barely visible along the edge of the lowest visible shelf. 
Caesar turns, looks from face to face... then: 
CAESAR [Luca, let's take a closer look.] (to Rocket) [Stay here. Keep them safe.] 
Rocket nods dutifully, and Caesar and Luca start off -- 
CUT TO: 
THROUGH THE BINOCULARS - SUNSET 
The HEAVILY SILHOUETTED FIGURES in the distance are still small, but from this closer vantage we can see now they're in the midst of placing a series of about twelve MYSTERIOUS, X- SHAPED STRUCTURES along the cliff's edge -- maybe this is some kind of defensive perimeter...? 
REVEAL CAESAR LOWERING HIS BINOCULARS; he looks confused as he turns to Luca, lying beside him on the edge of a ridge. 
LUCA [What are they doing?] 
CAESAR (shakes his head) I don't know... 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
Caesar turns back, looking through the binoculars again, trying to decipher this strange activity -- when Luca GRUNTS at him with quiet alarm. Caesar turns. 
LUCA (points) [What's that? A patrol?] 
Caesar looks -- 
THROUGH THE BINOCULARS 
finding a PAIR OF HORSES on a ledge right below. 
CAESAR (O.S.) Don't see riders... 
Suddenly AN OUT OF FOCUS SHAPE RISES directly in front of the binoculars -- Caesar drops the glasses to discover -- 
AN ALPHA OMEGA SOLDIER looming right above him, rifle raised! 
The soldier pulls the trigger -- CLICK -- but the gun is jammed! Panicked, the soldier rears back, about to lunge forward with the rifle's BAYONET -- when -- 
LUCA DIVES PROTECTIVELY in front of Caesar -- 
-- taking the bayonet blade in his gut as he YANKS the man down, WRESTLING him to the ground! They roll violently, finally coming to a stop, Luca atop the motionless soldier -- 
Caesar's eyes land on the BLOOD-STAINED BAYONET, lying in the snow beside them -- he scrambles up, rushing to Luca -- 
-- when a SECOND SOLDIER steps out, startling Caesar -- about to shoot -- when -- 
WHAM! THE SECOND SOLDIER CRUMPLES, revealing Rocket behind him, having just clubbed him with the butt of a rifle. 
Rocket looks to Caesar, signs regretfully, out of breath: 
ROCKET [I saw them from up there... Coming for you...] 
They both turn immediately to Luca... who is rolling painfully off the dead man; he looks at them helplessly, GASPING, clutching his gut... CUT TO: 
BACK UP IN THE WOODS - DUSK 
Waiting anxiously at the edge of the trees, Bad Ape, Maurice and the Girl stare as -- 
ROCKET returns, climbing quickly up toward them, a grim expression on his face, clutching the bayoneted rifle in his hand... right behind him, CAESAR CARRIES LUCA across his back, like a Vietnam soldier shouldering a fallen brother. 
They all retreat into the safety of the woods, the group converging around Caesar as he lowers Luca to the ground... 
Emotion in his eyes, Caesar looks down at his loyal friend. Fading fast, Luca smiles weakly. He manages to raise a hand, holding it out to Caesar; Caesar grasps it firmly. 
LUCA [At least this time... I was able to protect you...] 
CAESAR (CONT'D) Wait -- my little son -- is he here...? 
But Spear just falls to the ground, Caesar watches aghast -- when an APE FOOT steps right beside him -- Caesar turns, startled -- looks up to see -- 
RED standing ominously right above him! The BUTT OF RED'S RIFLE comes SLAMMING DOWN into us -- and we SMASH TO -- 
BLACKNESS 
HOLD for a long moment. Hear the echoing sound of WATER SLOWLY DRIPPING. Then HARD CUT TO -- 
SUPER TIGHT ON CAESAR'S EYES 
as they wince open, disoriented, in pain, his face pressed to the ground... A SHAFT OF HARSH LIGHT blasts down from above. Water drops splatter around him. 
Caesar peers around, struggling to get his bearings, his POV drifting in and out of focus: he finds TRACKS embedded in the ground, a rusted-out TRAIN ENGINE in the shadows. The place was a depot of some kind. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
He glances up at the cavernous, curved ceiling; sodium vapor security lamps shine in through a rip, which leaks melting snow. And then he notices -- 
AN OUT OF FOCUS FIGURE LOOMING IN THE DARKNESS 
a few feet away: it's PREACHER, tensely holding his crossbow, looking unsettled as he stands guard... when an unseen VOICE comes quietly from the shadows as WET FOOTSTEPS approach: 
THE COLONEL (O.S.) Grant and Lee... Wellington and Napoleon... 
A SHAPE finally enters the light: it's THE COLONEL, who studies Caesar inscrutably: 
THE COLONEL (CONT'D) Custer... and Sitting Bull. (then) You're probably not much of a reader. But this is... this is a big moment. This is... beyond... historic. 
Caesar glares up at him, rage welling... 
THE COLONEL (CONT'D) Where were you...? (then) We came upon your herd... we got lucky. But I was surprised. You weren't with them. 
They stare at each other an intense beat... Caesar crawls menacingly toward him -- but is instantly YANKED BACK HARD. 
GASPING, Caesar reaches for his throat to discover his wrists are shackled and his neck is CHAINED by a NECK COLLAR... Writhing, he turns to see RED cruelly gripping the end of the chain. Preacher takes a step closer, levelling his crossbow threateningly; Caesar's eyes lock with his. The Colonel watches their stare-down: 
THE COLONEL (CONT'D) I hope you don't come to regret sparing his life. He's quite a good shot. 
The Colonel just watches Caesar a beat; beneath the chilling stillness of his eyes we sense something dangerous, damaged. 
THE COLONEL (CONT'D) Have you finally come to save your apes? 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) 
CAESAR (still in pain, seething) I... didn't know they were here. (then) I came for you. 
The Colonel searches Caesar's ferocious expression, surprised, something dawning on him for the first time: 
THE COLONEL I see... I kill somebody close to you that night...? 
Caesar looks him right in the eye, unblinking... 
CAESAR My... family. 
The Colonel stares down, some mysterious nerve jolted inside him. He comes closer, stands right above Caesar, looking at him for a long beat, something about this revelation churning in his mind; Red cautiously tightens his grip on the chain. 
THE COLONEL I'm sorry.     I was there to kill you. 
Caesar just glares up at him, the Colonel so close... Struck, the Colonel inches even closer: 
THE COLONEL (CONT'D) My God, look at your eyes... they're almost human... (a long beat; then) How did you know I was here? 
CAESAR I was told you were coming... That others would be joining you here. 
THE COLONEL (a cryptic beat) Joining me...? 
CAESAR To finish us off... for good. 
THE COLONEL (he smiles) Who told you that? 
But Caesar won't answer. The Colonel just stares at him, then turns to Red and NODS: 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (3) 
THE COLONEL (CONT'D) Ok, let's go. 
Red quickly responds -- 
RED Ok -- ok, Kerna...! 
Red YANKS Caesar roughly to his feet; Caesar struggles, CHOKING -- as Preacher moves in too -- and we HARD CUT TO: 
EXT. PRISON CAMP - YARD - TRACKING SHOT - NIGHT 
MOVING with the Colonel, Red, and Preacher as they march Caesar into the frozen, desolate yard; Caesar steals a glance back at a CORRODED SIGN over the hangar: CA STATE BORDER QUARANTINE DETENTION AND RELOCATION CENTER, PROCESSING DEPOT 
As they walk along train tracks, Caesar turns forward, SEES SOLDIERS huddled around fires in front of temporary barracks, killing time -- they stare up at him menacingly -- up ahead -- 
A PAIR OF GUARD TOWERS LOOM 
More HAND-PAINTED SLOGANS hang on signs, recalling the cult- like vibe of the base camp. Armed GUARDS stare down as they pass, straightening tensely at the sight of the Colonel -- 
CLOSE ON THE COLONEL 
watching the brutality; he stops shaving a moment, calmly pulls a FLASK from his hip, and takes a slow drink; then he disappears into the tower again. 
CUT TO: 
CAESAR 
MARCHING gravely with hordes of apes across the snowy yard... ARMED SOLDIERS pace menacingly atop FUEL TANKER RAILCARS along the side of the camp, keeping watch over the prisoners. Caesar slows, suddenly struck by what's LOOMING up ahead -- 
THE EXTREMELY HIGH BARRIER WALL 
that seals in the front of the camp; it's unlike anything we've ever seen. Part of it is man-made, cracked slabs of weathered concrete erected side by side years ago; but a vast section, growing right out of the original wall, is ape-made. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
Massive tree-trunks have been fastened in a primitive but elaborate framework, into which huge stones are being set, one by one. The apes have been rebuilding the crumbling wall. 
As Caesar moves closer, his eyes are drawn to an old slab of cement, still standing in the midst of the ape construction. On it, "A" is painted in HUGE BLOOD RED GRAFFITI SCRAWL; next to this drip the words: "HUMANITY'S LAST STAND". Caesar stares at the words, chilled... as we CUT TO: 
EXT. THE WALL - DAY 
Caesar labors, just another slave in the sea of apes passing brutally heavy boulders to be laid into the growing wall, as Soldiers keep GUNS trained on them. Caesar squints out at even more apes perched dangerously on the rock shelf above the tanker cars, quarrying for the stones. 
Beside him, Lake heaves another boulder; Caesar peers past her at the apes around them; they look WEARY, GAUNT; on the framework above, EXHAUSTED apes -- Ape Elder among them -- battle to lift boulders on ropes. Lake sees the anguish on Caesar's face as he takes in the suffering, she signs: 
LAKE [We haven't had food or water since we got here...] 
Stunned, anger fills his face; he glares up at the structure: 
CAESAR [Why do they need a wall...?] 
Lake looks back at him, shaking her head: I don't know -- when Caesar sees -- 
THE COLONEL arriving at the work site; his Soldiers nervously address him as his eyes roam the wall, surveying the progress -- then fix on Caesar -- when suddenly a SOLDIER CRIES OUT: 
BOYLE (O.S.) HEY!   HEY! 
The Colonel turns to the commotion -- Caesar turns too -- to find Ape Elder struggling high up on the framework, dizzy with fatigue, losing grip on his rope as Soldiers and Turncoat Apes watch with alarm from below -- 
-- when he COLLAPSES, the rope ripping from his fingers -- the rock CRASHES into the framing, KNOCKING DOWN a big section of the stone wall in a violent chain reaction! 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
Furious, Boyle spins to one of the Turncoats -- Red. Caesar watches as he orders Red to punish Ape Elder; Red and the other turncoats pull the feeble ape from the rubble and drag him into the yard, in full sight of the Colonel, where Red dutifully begins to WHIP the old ape...! 
Startled, Caesar looks at the Colonel, who watches the beating, unmoved -- then back to the helpless old chimp -- 
ON CAESAR 
as he steps slowly forward in horror, pained by the excruciating sight -- the apes in his line follow, affected too... Caesar pulls himself up onto one of the tree trunks in the framework, stepping into a CLOSE UP, his rage starting to boil... until finally, unable to bear it, he ERUPTS: 
CAESAR LEAVE HIM!!! 
Heads turn, everyone stopping dead in their tracks as CAESAR'S BOOMING VOICE ECHOES across the yard... Even Red goes still, turning with the others to SEE -- 
CAESAR UP ON THE FRAMEWORK 
GLARING back defiantly; then, he turns slowly to the Colonel, fury in his eyes, no concern for his own safety... 
For a moment, the yard is suspended in TOTAL SILENCE as Caesar and the Colonel lock eyes -- when, one by one, the APES START TO CHANT... 
Low and guttural at first... then RISING INTO A DEAFENING CHORUS OF REBELLIOUS HOOTS AND SHRIEKS -- as they defiantly DROP THE STONES AND TOOLS to the ground! 
Surprised, Caesar turns... stunned by what he has started... he peers around at the apes, to find them all gazing at him in solidarity as they chant... 
CLOSE ON APE ELDER still on his knees, clutching his wounds, watching in awe as the protest reaches a fever pitch... 
The Soldiers are at a loss as to how to restore order -- they turn to the Colonel who just stares ominously at Caesar... 
Eyes fearfully on the Colonel, a SOLDIER FRANTICALLY GESTURES across the chaos to Red and the Turncoats: get him! 
CAESAR 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) 
turns as Turncoats and Soldiers approach (Preacher among them); unafraid, Caesar steps down to meet them -- his chain gang CHANTING protectively -- when the Turncoats GRAB Caesar! The Soldiers anxiously hold the others in check with their weapons -- as the roar of the crowd grows even LOUDER -- 
Caesar glares as Preacher nervously unclips his keys from his belt, tosses them to Red, who unshackles him... 
THE COLONEL 
watches as Caesar is marched into the yard, and thrust onto his knees beside Ape Elder. The Colonel considers Caesar; then, eyes still on him, gestures calmly to the Turncoats -- 
The Turncoats tighten their grip on Caesar's arms -- and Red suddenly WHIPS Caesar's back with a VICIOUS SNAP! 
The APES' CHANTING SUDDENLY FALTERS as -- 
Caesar WINCES -- but he refuses to break eye-contact with the Colonel, who stares back, a battle of wills... 
The Colonel nods; and Red LASHES Caesar again! 
Spirits broken, the apes go SILENT; beside Caesar, Ape Elder drops his eyes. 
PREACHER (CONT'D) Look, I owe you one, so let me set you straight here, ok? I think he respects you, he does... that's why you're still alive. But believe me, he can do a lot worse than this. I've seen it. (haunted, almost a whisper) You do not want to agitate the man. Understand? So just... 
He gestures with his hand: back off. Disturbed, Caesar holds his gaze; then watches as Preacher descends the platform... 
CUT TO: 
BEHIND CAESAR HANGING LIMPLY ON THE X - NIGHT 
We're looking out past Caesar over the camp, as exhausted apes are herded away from the wall, the work day over... A diesel GENERATOR COUGHS to life, HARSH LIGHTS blinking on. 
Caesar squints into the glare, weary -- when the SOUND OF SOLDIERS makes him look below -- at a group approaching from the rear of the camp, rolling ominous-looking ARTILLERY; suddenly concerned, he watches them head toward the apes... 
...the fraught apes look alarmed as they see the weapons and Soldiers coming their way -- then Caesar discovers even more Soldiers with MASSIVE MACHINE GUNS by the wall. Unnerved, he sees them hoisting the guns up to the sentry towers... where others position them on tripods; but then Caesar NOTICES -- 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
All the weapons are POINTED OUTWARD, BEYOND THE CAMP... 
Caesar is relieved; he stares at the weapons, perplexed -- when he hears FOOTSTEPS; he turns to see -- 
RED climbing the platform toward him, gripping a long MACHETE with a look of cruel satisfaction... Startled, Caesar tenses; he peers around anxiously to FIND -- 
THE COLONEL eerily watching from the warden tower window... 
Chilled, Caesar turns back, bracing for the worst, as Red stops before him... He looks at the knife, then meets Red's cold gaze. Steeling himself, he hardens, his voice hoarse: 
CAESAR What did the Colonel promise you? You really think he will let you live... after we are gone? 
Red just stares, contempt in his eyes. 
CAESAR (CONT'D) No matter what you do... you'll never be one of them. (then) You let them call you "donkey"... You are ape. 
Red raises his knife, examining it in his hands; he runs his fingers along the edge... Then looks at Caesar, sneers: 
RED Koba right. You think you know better... than rest of apes. But look you now. (his expression darkens) You nothing. 
Red SUDDENLY LIFTS THE MACHETE -- Caesar's eyes widen as RED SWINGS DOWN AT HIM VICIOUSLY -- THWAP!!! THE BLADE SINKS INTO THE WOOD, AN INCH FROM CAESAR'S WRIST, HACKING THROUGH THE ROPE -- ! Caesar turns to Red in shock, as his arm is set free. 
RED (CONT'D) (menacing, quiet) Kerna... want see you. 
Caesar looks back up at the tower window where the Colonel remains staring a moment longer; then turns, and disappears. 
CUT TO: 
BLACKNESS 
Then a DOOR IS OPENED, REVEALING -- we are -- 
INT. WARDEN'S TOWER - NIGHT 
The Colonel stands with his back to us, leaning on a map- covered table in the former window-lined control center, smoke rises from sage and grass smudge burning in a tin bowl. 
CAESAR, PREACHER AND RED ENTER 
approaching the Colonel, who still doesn't acknowledge them; as searchlights outside sweep through, Caesar catches a brief glimpse of a room just off the control center -- it looks almost like a sanctum; light passes over APE SKULLS... the word "HISTORY" scrawled on a wall... then the room goes dark again. Caesar looks unsettled -- his gaze returning to the Colonel, and noticing for the first time painful looking BRAND SCARS on the back of his hands: one Alpha, one Omega. 
The Colonel finally speaks, eyes still on the map: 
THE COLONEL Interfere with the work again, and I'll begin slaughtering the apes, one by one. Understand? I need that wall. 
He looks up coldly at Caesar, then nods at Preacher: that's all -- they start to lead Caesar out, but he won't go yet -- 
CAESAR Apes... need food... water. 
THE COLONEL (eyes on the map) They'll get food and water when they finish the work. 
CAESAR Give them food and water... or they will not be able to finish. 
The Colonel looks up, amused by Caesar's audacity. 
THE COLONEL You know you're very emotional. (then) What makes you think you're in a position to make demands? 
Caesar doesn't reply. The Colonel turns back to the map -- Preacher nervously tugs again on Caesar's chain -- 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
PREACHER C'mon -- 
But Caesar stands firm, eyes fixed on the Colonel: 
CAESAR The soldiers who are coming here... are not coming to join you, are they? 
The Colonel slowly looks up, smiles, suddenly intrigued -- as Red warily tightens his grip on Caesar's chain... 
CAESAR (CONT'D) I saw men outside by the wall... preparing for battle... 
The Colonel studies him, surprised: 
THE COLONEL I was told you were smart, but... that's impressive. 
He stares at Caesar a moment; then finally: 
THE COLONEL (CONT'D) No.   They won't be joining me. 
Preacher watches as The Colonel steps forward, venturing closer to Caesar, seemingly unconcerned for his safety... 
PREACHER ...sir -- 
The Colonel holds up his hand to silence Preacher as he stops right in front of Caesar again, eye to eye... Caesar burns, tortured by the agonizing effort to restrain his rage... 
THE COLONEL What do you think my men would've done to your apes... if you had killed me? 
Caesar looks up at the Colonel. The Colonel holds Caesar's angry stare as he starts slowly forward: 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (6) 
THE COLONEL (CONT'D) Or is killing me more important...? 
The Colonel lingers tauntingly... finally, he turns to Preacher -- and as Preacher and Red move in, we -- 
CUT TO: 
PREACHER AND RED MARCHING CAESAR OUT OF THE DEPOT - NIGHT 
They head for the yard -- Preacher utters quietly, shaken: 
PREACHER Didn't I tell you not to agitate him? That was not smart, man... 
Caesar glances at Preacher, then at Red behind them; he turns forward, speaks softly to Preacher, a hint of sympathy: 
CAESAR If this battle is coming... you should leave, while you still can. 
Preacher turns to him; then abruptly stops: 
PREACHER Leave?     What are you talking about? 
CAESAR You are not like him. 
Preacher looks at Caesar, taken aback -- maybe even offended: 
PREACHER He was right, you do think he's sick, don't you? You're just like them. He's not crazy. The world's gone crazy. And he's the only one with the vision to get us through this. The Colonel's a great man. He sacrificed everything for us. You can't judge him. Who are you to judge him? (darkening) I was trying to give you a heads up, keep you out of his way, I don't even know why. But if you think you and I have some kind of relationship -- that you're gonna give me, what, advice? You can disavow yourself of that notion right fucking now. 
Caesar is stunned.    Preacher raises his crossbow: 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
PREACHER (CONT'D) C'mon, kong. 
He glances back, nodding to Red O.S., and we -- 
CUT TO: 
HAND-HELD BINOCULAR POV AS RED SHOVES CAESAR FORWARD 
Snow drifts down around them as they march Caesar through the yard, past the soldiers' barracks, LIGHTS inside GOING OUT one by one... REVEAL -- 
ON THE CLIFFS JUST ABOVE THE CAMP - NIGHT 
Concealed behind boulders, Rocket LOWERING THE BINOCULARS, gravely SCOPING OUT the camp -- as Maurice, the Girl on his back, and Bad Ape arrive next to him, climbing down rocks. 
MAURICE (worried) [How is he?] 
Rocket shakes his head: not good. He rises, waves for them to follow him further down the mountain. They start to go... 
EXT. YARD - NEAR THE PENS - NIGHT 
Caesar waits grimly at the base of the platform, as Red unshackles his hands; Preacher stands guard, the X looming. 
Caesar looks up to discover APES gathered at the bars of their pen, unseen by Red and Preacher, whose backs are to them. Their starved faces are etched with worry for Caesar. He softens, eyes settling on Lake's gentle gaze as Red continues to unshackle him. Concern fills Lake's eyes: 
LAKE [You look weary.] 
Caesar looks back at her, then peers out at the MASS OF DISPIRITED APE FACES. Determination sets in; he steals a look at his captors, then signs discreetly to the apes: 
CAESAR [Do not lose hope... Some way, somehow, we will finish the journey to our new home. I will find a way to get us out of here.] 
The Apes return moved stares -- when Red hands Preacher back the key, and Preacher nods for Caesar to climb the platform. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
Lake and the others watch as Caesar, weakened, takes an exhausted step -- and suddenly STUMBLES, knocking into Preacher -- who shoves him back, startled -- 
PREACHER Get off! 
The Apes look scared for Caesar as Red yanks him down. 
Recovering, Caesar lifts his head, glancing meaningfully back at Lake, then rises to his feet... 
Confused, Lake watches as Caesar continues up the steps -- when she notices CAESAR'S HAND slipping behind his back -- as the hand subtly opens, Lake suddenly SEES Caesar is carefully showing her something -- 
Preacher's shackle key is now concealed in Caesar's palm, its small key ring looped slyly around his middle finger. 
Lake can't believe her eyes; with dawning hope she turns, points it out to the others -- their eyes widen, excitement spreading as they watch him ascend the platform... 
EXT. SNOWY CANYON FLOOR OUTSIDE THE PRISON WALL - LATE NIGHT 
Rocket leads as the group sneaks along the base of the wall. They arrive at a spot where the wall has come down, steal a look around the edge, peering into the camp... 
Rocket nods and as they start to explore deeper, we CUT TO -- 
ANOTHER ANGLE FAR BEHIND THEM 
We see the two apes and the light from their flashlight start to shrink from view -- REVEAL -- 
BAD APE 
watching from the mouth of the tunnel in the hole they found last night. He gazes anxiously as they disappear -- when -- 
We hear SHRILL, DISTANT WHISTLES blowing -- Bad Ape turns to see -- THE GIRL CLIMBING the rope ladder toward the sound -- 
Bad Ape rushes to the ladder, calling up to her, alarmed -- 
BAD APE No no no -- no climb -- ! 
But she continues, climbing out the top... Bad Ape clutches his head, torn about what to do; then reluctantly starts up -- 
AT THE TOP OF THE HOLE 
Bad Ape pokes his head up... to find the Girl heading away -- 
ON THE GIRL 
as she heads toward the edge of the rocks, drawn by something she sees in the distance -- 
BAD APE (O.S.) No, no!   Where you go?! 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
He appears, running after her.. He finds her SQUINTING out at something past the rocks... He follows her stare to ONE OF THE OPENINGS in the massive wall. He whispers to her: 
BAD APE (CONT'D) What?   What you see...? 
INT. TUNNEL - DAY 
Maurice and Rocket head down the tunnel -- 
ROCKET [Must be under the camp by now!] 
They stop in a cavernous concrete hub where the sewage tunnels converge -- 
MAURICE [Wonder how close we are... to where soldiers keep apes?] 
He lifts his flashlight to the ceiling; they both look up -- 
CUT TO: 
A LOW ANGLE SHOT ALONG THE PRISON TRAIN TRACKS - DAY 
Apes work on the wall in the distance, some HOISTING heavy BM- 12 ROCKET LAUNCHERS into place above -- when -- we HEAR a QUIET RUSTLING sound -- which continues as we PULL FOCUS to the train rail in front of us, and begin PUSHING TOWARD IT... 
As we clear over the rail, we TIP DOWN to see the BALLAST GRAVEL under the tracks STARTING TO MOVE... The stones SHUDDER, and suddenly begin to FUNNEL DOWNWARD as we CUT TO -- 
THE TUNNEL BELOW 
where a RUSH OF GRAVEL showers over Rocket, who stands on Maurice's back as Rocket claws through the earth above them. 
DAYLIGHT suddenly peeks in through a TINY HOLE in the surface. Rocket stops digging; he glances down at Maurice, then carefully presses his eye to the hole... 
ROCKET'S POV UP THROUGH HOLE 
Peering up through the train tracks we can see A TALL METAL POLE looming against the winter sky. As we -- 
CUT WIDE TO THE CAMP ABOVE 
The pole is revealed to be a TRAIN SIGNAL SWITCH rising in an exposed area of the yard, Soldiers nearby on either side. 
CUT TO: 
CAESAR - SEEN THROUGH BINOCULARS - DUSK 
He is covered in frost and ice, shivering with hypothermia, very near death... 
BAD APE (O.S.) (quietly distraught) Ohhhh no, friend... 
REVEAL BAD APE - STILL AT THE EDGE OF THE ROCKY OUTCROPPING 
lowering the binoculars -- he turns to the girl to share the bad news -- 
BAD APE (CONT'D) He -- 
when he sees 
THE GIRL 
already starting to walk away toward the camp! 
BAD APE (urgent whisper) No! 
He creeps out from behind the rocks after her    -- FRANTICALLY WHISPERING: 
BAD APE (CONT'D) No no no... no no no... 
CUT BACK TO: 
CAESAR 
gazing nervously through the bars at the Girl, who stands at the Apes' pen, her back to us; she seems engaged in some transaction with them, the Apes all trying to get near her -- 
Caesar's eyes dart tensely around at GUARDS ON PATROL in the distance, unaware of her presence, but for how long...? 
Finally, the Girl turns and heads toward Caesar, CRADLING SOMETHING IN HER ARMS. Caesar watches curiously as she steps up to his cage. He glances at the APES IN THEIR PEN to find them all watching expectantly... 
Caesar turns back to the Girl; she leans forward carefully, as if about to spill the contents from her arms -- puzzled, Caesar reaches his hands out to catch whatever it is -- AND A LONG STREAM OF GRAIN RUSHES INTO HIS PALMS. 
Surprised, Caesar looks up at her... then out at the Apes in the pen, their eyes all still on him. One of them raises his hands, quietly pressing his fists together, SIGNING proudly: 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
APE [Apes together strong.] 
A wave of emotion floods Caesar's face; and then he sees other Apes silently raising their fists too... Caesar is completely overcome as each and every one of them joins in. 
A smile slowly surfaces on Caesar's face; you can almost see his strength returning... 
The Girl follows Caesar's gaze to the Apes and their up- stretched hands; then turns back to Caesar. She uncertainly raises her fists together too... smiling, proud of herself. 
MAURICE, ROCKET, AND BAD APE 
watch from behind the gate, affected by the sight -- when they spot something the apes and the Girl cannot yet see -- 
THE COLONEL AND SOME OF THE OFFICERS IN THE DISTANCE 
deep in conference, walking in the direction of the pens...! 
MAURICE AND ROCKET exchange terrified looks -- 
MAURICE [If humans see her, they will kill her...] 
CUT TO: 
ON CAESAR AND THE GIRL 
as they SPIN, startled -- suddenly seeing the Colonel and troops stepping into view ten feet away -- when -- a sudden COMMOTION in the distance grabs their attention -- 
Caesar grunts urgently to the Girl, nodding for her to hide -- she presses quickly behind one of the guard tower legs -- just as the Colonel and troops stop in the path right before Caesar's cage, still gazing off at the disturbance... 
Caesar follows their looks to SEE -- 
A SQUAD OF FIVE SOLDIERS, guns-drawn, amped up, shouting at AN UNSEEN INTRUDER... As they approach, prodding with their weapons, Caesar discovers the intruder is -- 
ROCKET.   He marches slowly, chin-raised defiantly. 
Caesar watches in shock as Rocket is brought toward the waiting Colonel... who slowly turns and looks suspiciously at Caesar -- unaware of the Girl just behind the tower leg... 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
As Rocket arrives at gunpoint, the Colonel gestures to Red. Red and Rocket exchange hard stares; Red moves to restrain Rocket's arms -- but ROCKET SUDDENLY RESISTS, thrashing into Red, HEAD-BUTTING HIM -- Red stumbles, clutching his head, stunned... then LAUNCHES furiously back at Rocket! 
The two apes begin VICIOUSLY WRESTLING as the SOLDIERS WATCH, guns trained; a few LAUGH derisively, amused by the display -- TWO TURNCOATS nervously approach, unsure what to do -- 
Caesar seizes this momentary distraction -- gestures for the Girl to make a run for it -- SHE DARTS AWAY -- ducking behind the long barracks nearby, streaking toward the wall -- 
The Colonel peers down annoyed at Red and Rocket; he calmly pulls out his sidearm, points down at them and FIRES -- ! 
Caesar's head whips around -- as Rocket and Red FREEZE, startled -- a CLOUD OF DIRT kicking up from where the bullet hit the ground beside them... 
Red immediately takes the opportunity to get the upper hand, forcing Rocket's face to the ground, pinning him. The Colonel walks closer to Rocket; stares at him a beat... 
THE COLONEL How many are out there?   Are there others? 
Rocket stays silent, refusing to show even a hint of fear. 
THE COLONEL (CONT'D) (to Soldiers) Sweep the area. (turns to Red) Put him in the pen. 
As the Colonel walks off, Red abruptly leaps to his feet, grabbing Rocket by the ankle -- Rocket FLAILS VIOLENTLY as Red drags him across the dirt and ice... 
Caesar watches in horror as the turncoats move in, BEATING ROCKET into submission as they HURL him into the pen. One roughly SHACKLES HIM -- as Red delivers a last, VICIOUS KICK, leaving Rocket in a crumpled heap as they exit. 
Caesar's stricken eyes remain fixed on Rocket as he struggles to his feet. His face bloodied and bruised, Rocket looks back at Caesar through the bars of their pens -- and to Caesar's surprise, Rocket smiles at him... He SIGNS: 
ROCKET [Feeling better?] 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) 
Thrown, Caesar looks at him, then manages a slight smile; he nods. Rocket nods back, pleased: 
ROCKET (CONT'D) [Good.   Then we can talk about escape.] 
He brings his fists together: "Apes together strong." Emotional, Caesar smiles, proud of his friend; as he brings his own fists together... 
PRE-LAP -- A LONE HUMAN VOICE SINGING OUT in gospel tones: 
EXECUTIVE OFFICER (O.S.) Hu-uh-left... Left-right-left... 
AS WE SLOWLY DISSOLVE TO: 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
TANKER GUARD That's high enough, kong! 
Caesar submissively holds up his hands. The soldiers eye him a beat longer as Caesar returns to quarrying... then, coast clear, Caesar peers out at -- 
The ROCK OUTCROPPING in the distance, outside the camp; he can just make out a DARK FORM behind the boulders -- CUT TO: 
HANDHELD BINOCULAR POV OF CAESAR ON THE QUARRY LEDGE 
Caesar looking right at us, signing: 
CAESAR [37 steps to the adult cage...   55 to the children.] 
REVEAL MAURICE 
lowering the binoculars; he ducks down behind the rocks -- 
-- where the Girl and Bad Ape await his command. 
Maurice points to the Girl, then up at his eyes, looking around -- as if to say, "You, keep a look out." The Girl nods back very seriously, his little soldier. 
CUT TO: 
THE DUSTY COMPASS 
from the airstream trailer. The NEEDLE QUIVERS as the compass sits in a massive ape palm -- we are: 
INT. TUNNEL - AT THE CONCRETE-FILLED IMPASSE - DAY 
Maurice stares at the compass in his hand as Bad Ape watches, holding the flashlight... finally, Maurice lifts his head, and POINTS TO TWO DIFFERENT SPOTS ALONG THE TUNNEL WALL. 
Bad Ape nods eagerly, moves to one of the spots, and STARTS TO DIG tentatively, looking to Maurice for approval; Maurice nods, goes to the other spot, STARTS DIGGING as well. 
EXT. HIGH OVER THE CAMP - NIGHT 
At gunpoint, apes roll MASSIVE SOPHISTICATED ARTILLERY out of the depot at the base of the mountain, and along the train tracks toward the barrier wall... 
AT THE BARRIER WALL 
A cluster of POWERFUL GORILLAS struggle to hoist an imposing high-tech RAPIER MISSILE LAUNCHER up to the top of the wall -- 
REVEAL -- WIDE ON THE NOW COMPLETED WALL -- MORE RAPIER LAUNCHERS BEING POSITIONED BY APES AND SOLDIERS ALL ALONG THE EXPANSE. The display of sheer force is a formidable sight. 
ON CAESAR -- WATCHING THE WALL FORTIFICATION 
as Red and Preacher march him across the yard amidst masses of weary apes being herded back to the pens; they arrive at -- 
CAESAR'S CAGE 
As Preacher starts to unlock the door, Caesar's gaze shifts to Red, and then to the ANGRY WELT over Red's eye where Rocket head-butted him; Red glowers, self-conscious. 
Preacher opens the door, and Red shoves Caesar in. Then Red steps forward to remove the chain leash from Caesar's neck collar, pressing his face menacingly close to Caesar's: 
RED You know Kerna shoot apes tomorrow... when wall is done. 
Caesar's eyes shift briefly to Preacher's, who looks away. Then he turns back to Red: 
CAESAR His wall is madness. It won't save him... any more than it will save you. 
RED I save myself. 
CAESAR Is there anything left... of you to save? 
A brief flash of uncertainty passes over Red as he meets Caesar's piercing eyes... then he musters a final hard stare at Caesar, and turns to go. 
CUT TO: 
BINOCULAR POV 
as the rest of the apes are prodded off the wall, the intimidating fortification now complete; REVEAL -- 
THE GIRL 
Watching from behind the rocks. She lowers the binoculars, blinking out at the camp a beat... 
CUT TO: 
MOVING WITH THE GIRL THROUGH THE TUNNEL 
Eyes wide, she searches for sign of Maurice or Bad Ape... She approaches the cement-filled impasse... finding TWO NEWLY DUG TUNNELS on either side of the blockage. She enters -- 
ONE OF THE NEW TUNNELS 
She heads toward the distant glow of a flashlight up ahead... Arriving behind Maurice, covered in dirt, still digging away. 
He stops, noticing her. He looks at her quizzically -- points upward, makes a tentative thumbs up sign -- "everything ok up there?" She nods. He smiles: 
MAURICE [You are very brave.] 
She looks at him, confused.     He gently repeats the sign: 
MAURICE (CONT'D) [Brave.] 
IT'S ROCKET. He stares down at Bad Ape, expressionless... and then a big smile spreads across his face. He turns excitedly to the look-out ape: 
ROCKET [This is the ape I told you about.] 
They all stare at him again, fascinated.       The look-out steps forward, and SIGNS to Bad Ape: 
LOOK-OUT [Thank you.] 
But Bad Ape looks up insecurely, not understanding the sign; seeing this, the look-out slowly reaches down into the hole, OFFERING HIS HAND. 
Bad Ape regards the hand uncertainly... then CLASPS it, beaming. He stares up at his new friend, then pats his chest with his other hand, bowing his head as he nods, quietly fumbling for a way to introduce himself: 
BAD APE ...Bad Ape. (shaking other apes' hands) Bad Ape... Bad Ape... 
More and more apes jostle to get a look, greeting him warmly, Bad Ape overcome by the affection from this new family. 
DOWN BELOW 
Maurice peers up at Bad Ape above him, trying to get a look at what's going on -- when -- Nova tugs on his fur. He looks at her, and she points -- 
DOWN THE TUNNEL 
where a SMALL STREAM OF WATER is creeping toward them. 
Maurice looks at the ground beneath him as the water starts to pool around his feet; alarmed, he instinctively steps forward to investigate -- forgetting Bad Ape on his shoulders. Bad Ape tumbles to the wet floor, surprised. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
Maurice spins, realizing; Bad Ape looks at the water around him, confused. As Maurice bends to help him, Bad Ape glances up, seeing something above -- Maurice follows his gaze to -- 
ROCKET peering over the edge of the hole with concern.       His eyes lock on Maurice's, immediately sensing trouble -- 
ROCKET [What's wrong?] 
CUT TO: 
EXT. CAESAR'S CAGE - NIGHT 
Caesar waits alone, staring     tensely at the apes across the way, all huddled around the     hole, backs to us. Rocket suddenly breaks through the     crowd to report to Caesar, who has been anxiously awaiting     news. Rocket looks grave: 
ROCKET [There's a problem.] 
As worry creeps into Caesar's face, we CUT TO -- 
INT. TUNNEL - IMMEDIATELY 
MUD AND WATER GUSH IN through a WIDENING FISSURE in the wall where Maurice had been digging -- Maurice and Bad Ape try desperately to plug the opening with earth and rocks... 
EXT. YARD - THE PENS - NIGHT 
We hear QUIET APE GRUNTING -- Caesar stands pressed to the bars of his cage looking across to a large group of apes gathered at the edge of their pen, all eyes fixed on Caesar. 
CLOSER ON THE PEN 
The apes in mid-debate -- 
ROCKET [We can't dig any further, it will flood the whole tunnel!] 
LAKE [If we don't dig further, we'll never get to the children! How are we going to get them out?] 
A sudden swell of APE GRUNTS echo the sentiment -- 
Caesar raises a hand to quiet the apes, peering around at the GUARDS PATROLLING THE CAMP to see if the noise alerted them -- 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
Rocket and some of the others glance up at THE GUARD TOWER directly above Caesar's cage... where Boyle is leaning suspiciously over the ledge. Boyle listens for a moment -- then, hearing no more commotion, leans back. 
The apes all pause warily for a beat; then Lake signs stealthily, worried: 
LAKE (CONT'D) [We have to keep looking down there, see if there's another way to reach the children...] 
But Caesar shakes his head, gravely serious: 
CAESAR [We must leave tonight!] 
Pained, Caesar turns behind him, glances at the children, all asleep in their pen -- he can see little Cornelius sleeping too -- he turns back to the other, decisive: 
CAESAR (CONT'D) [We'll have to get the children out above ground!] 
The apes exchange tense looks; then all look back at Caesar: 
ROCKET [How...?] 
EXT. WIDE SHOT OF THE CAMP - LATE NIGHT 
The lights in the soldiers' barracks go out, one by one... 
UP BY THE GUARD TOWER OVER THE ADULT APE PEN 
Boyle steps slowly out onto the catwalk, quietly drinking from a steaming thermos, staring out into the distance -- 
WHEN SPLAT! He is SUDDENLY PELTED HARD in the back of his head with a handful of what looks like WET MUD from somewhere below. Stunned, he looks at himself, wiping the disgusting muck off: wtf?! He peers furiously over the railing at the pen below -- 
LAKE, who immediately starts to unshackle herself -- she passes the keys down the line of her chain gang, they all begin to unshackle themselves too -- 
ROCKET moves to the pen door, uses BOYLE'S KEYS to unlock it -- then tosses BOYLE'S KEYS across to -- 
CAESAR, who starts to unlock his cage -- when he notices something -- he holds up his hand! Everyone freezes. They all look up at -- 
THE WARDEN'S TOWER 
to see the Colonel stepping toward his lighted window, his face in SILHOUETTE -- he might be staring down at them, or off into the distance, it's impossible to tell... 
Caesar and Rocket share a tense look -- 
ROCKET [Do you think he knows we're up to something?] 
Unsure, Caesar peers back up at the Colonel's silhouette. After a beat, the Colonel steps away from the window. Rocket looks anxiously at Caesar, raising the rifle: 
ROCKET (CONT'D) [Now?] 
CAESAR (shakes his head) [Wait till he turns out his lights.] 
HOLD as they stare at the lighted window, waiting... waiting... SOUNDS OF FIERCELY GUSTING WIND rising... as we -- 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. YARD - WIDE ON THE TOWER AND PENS - LATER 
IT'S SNOWING HARD NOW, a fresh layer blanketing everything. And still, the Colonel's lights remain on. The apes are all pressed to the bars of their pen, eyes fixed up on the Colonel's window; some pace, tortured by the wait... 
PUSHING IN ON CAESAR 
Staring up with coiled intensity, totally still... His gaze shifts to Rocket, whose eyes are locked on Caesar -- 
ROCKET [The sun will be up soon...] 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
Torn, Caesar steals a final look at the lighted window... then turns back to Rocket -- forced to make the call: 
CAESAR [We go now. Or die trying.] 
Rocket nods -- he waits as the SEARCHLIGHT PASSES, then darts out of the pen, holding the stolen rifle -- crossing to Caesar's cage, as Caesar steps out -- they both streak -- 
TOWARD THE SOLDIERS' BARRACKS 
ducking into an alley between the building and the children's pen -- they press against the barrack's wall, peering down the alley to see -- 
SOLDIERS PASSING BY THE CHILDREN'S PEN 
Caesar waits until the Soldiers cross out of sight -- then looks to Rocket, and they head for -- 
THE CHILDREN'S PEN 
A small cluster of kids rush to the door as Caesar unlocks it; others stir from their sleep, scrambling over to see -- 
Caesar and Rocket enter. The little apes swarm around them, wide-eyed. Caesar gently pats their heads, shushing them -- when suddenly he sees HIS SON in the crowd. Cornelius breaks into a run, clambering up over the backs of the others... straight into Caesar's arms. Emotion floods Caesar's face as he tightly embraces his son... 
CAESAR (overcome, holding him tight) I love you, son... 
CUT TO: 
A POV THROUGH A DOORWAY AT A GUARD TOWER 
We glimpse the side of the Guard's head as he stares down, eating -- 
REVEAL ROCKET, keeping lookout on the guard from the doorway; behind him the children are huddled with Caesar -- Caesar hustles the children toward a LIGHT POLE, quickly hoisting one after another up onto it -- 
CUT WIDER OVER THE CHILDREN'S PEN 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
where we see Caesar, Rocket and the children are on a second story landing, dangerously close to the Guard Tower -- the little apes scale the tall light pole, scrambling out onto -- 
THE ELECTRICAL LINE 
suspended high over the Guard Towers and camp -- 
As SNOW SWIRLS HARD all around them, the children make their way back toward the adult pen -- directly over the heads of the unwitting Soldiers below! 
IN THE ADULT PEN 
The children arrive on the wire above and begin dropping down silently, one by one -- into the waiting arms of Lake and other unchained apes -- the apes urgently hand the kids off to their anxious parents. 
As the emotional reunions continue, Caesar (Cornelius clinging around his neck) and Rocket finally arrive overhead too, each dropping down into the grasp of the massive gorillas waiting below. 
CUT TO: 
MAURICE 
Staring up urgently from the hole in the adult pen... as Caesar and the apes converge above; Caesar and Rocket begin HANDING THE CHILDREN DOWN... 
IN THE HOLE 
Maurice lowers the kids to the tunnel floor; they look up to find Nova extending her hand... and they start off after her down the tunnel... 
Mesmerized, Red watches motionless as Caesar charges fearlessly through the chaos toward the TANKER directly beneath gunners on the wall! 
Caesar continues through the smoke and debris -- finally grabbing one of the grenades from the bandolier -- eyes fixed on the tanker just 30 feet away -- rearing back, about to pull the pin -- WHEN SUDDENLY -- 
CAESAR DROPS, CLUTCHING HIS SIDE -- TUMBLING TO THE GROUND! 
Shocked, Red watches as Caesar, in agony, touches his abdomen, discovering BLOOD; Caesar reaches behind him to find he's been shot in the back with a CROSSBOW ARROW... 
Red looks up to see -- PREACHER stalking through the haze and snow, out of the pen area, almost shocked himself at what he has just done -- he nervously loads another arrow, in turmoil as he moves toward Caesar. 
Gasping in pain, Caesar SNAPS the arrow from his side, and turns, seeing Preacher too... 
Red stands frozen, gripped by the sight of Caesar lying there helpless -- 
GUNNER (O.S.) (CONT'D) GODAMMIT!!! 
Red turns, startled, to find the Gunner screaming at him, momentarily turned from the battle -- 
GUNNER (CONT'D) YOU STUPID DONKEY!!! WHERE'S MY LAUNCHER!?! 
Red suddenly looks at the weapon in his hands, remembering what he was ordered to do -- still returning to his senses, he nods to the Gunner -- who immediately turns back to the battle, FIRING RELENTLESSLY at the apes... 
CUT TO: 
CAESAR ON THE GROUND 
as he sees Preacher anxiously closing in... Caesar's eyes frantically dart for an avenue of escape, but there is none. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
His pained gaze returns to Preacher who comes to a stop just 25 feet away, hesitating, torn -- then, finally steeling himself, he raises the LOADED CROSSBOW -- when -- 
FSSSSSSST--KABLOOM! Preacher DISAPPEARS in a HUGE BLAST!!! AND EVERYTHING GOES INSTANTLY SILENT, THE SOUND REPLACED BY A QUIET RINGING -- 
Stunned, disoriented, Caesar looks around him, deafened, finally peering up to discover -- 
RED ON THE WALL holding the SMOKING LAUNCHER, looking down stoically. 
Caesar can't believe it... He gazes up in shock at -- 
RED, who just gazes back, calmly holding the weapon, almost in a state of peace -- while BEHIND HIM -- 
THE GUNNER turns, suddenly realizing what Red has just done, freaking out, his SCREAMING INAUDIBLE to Caesar's ringing ears -- the Gunner pulls out his PISTOL -- pointing it at Red, who doesn't even react -- we see just a split-second of his SILENT MUZZLE FLASH -- when we CUT -- 
CLOSE ON CAESAR 
as he takes in the grim sight, pained -- THEN -- 
THE GUNNER turns and takes aim at CAESAR! 
Caesar scrambles, the sounds around him (and us) suddenly starting to return -- as -- he SNATCHES UP THE GRENADE from the ground beside him -- jumping to his feet -- 
-- narrowly dodging the Gunner's bullets tearing up earth around him -- as he PULLS THE PIN from the grenade, desperately LAUNCHING it straight for the tanker beneath the wall -- 
The Gunner's alarmed eyes suddenly whip toward the tanker -- as Caesar takes off, sprinting in the opposite direction -- 
-- when the grenade EXPLODES and THE TANKER ERUPTS -- ENGULFING the WALL beside it, and consuming all the Gunners above in its INCREDIBLE BLAST!!! 
Caesar races into the adult pen -- as behind him, FLAMES CLIMB HIGH INTO THE SKY -- when SUDDENLY -- THE TRAIN CAR NEXT TO THE TANKER EXPLODES TOO! 
Still running, Caesar steals a startled look back -- as ANOTHER CAR EXPLODES! 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
He DIVES down into the hole -- as -- 
WE CUT WIDE OVER THE CAMP -- AND THE CHAIN REACTION CONTINUES -- CARS ERUPTING ONE AFTER ANOTHER -- BLASTING THE CAMP APART -- HEADING BACK ALONG THE TRACKS TOWARD THE DEPOT AT THE BASE OF THE MOUNTAIN -- A CATACLYSMIC DISPLAY OF DESTRUCTION SO LARGE, IT'S STAGGERING!!! 
SMASH TO: 
CAESAR RUNNING THROUGH THE TUNNELS BELOW 
AS THE SHOCKWAVES CONTINUE, THE TUNNELS GIVING WAY, BEGINNING TO COLLAPSE BEHIND HIM! 
CAESAR RACES FOR LIGHT AT THE TUNNEL'S END -- LEAPING FOR THE LADDER -- SCRAMBLING UP -- WHEN THE WHOOSH OF DEBRIS SUDDENLY SWEEPS AROUND HIM -- AND HE EMERGES -- TUMBLING OUT -- 
THROUGH THE HOLE IN THE ROCKY OUTCROPPING 
And flat onto his stomach! 
Finally, he lifts his head to see the feet of apes all around, their backs to him -- as he rises, he finds them all staring out beyond the outcropping in awe... 
He slowly presses his way through the crowd, climbing higher on the rocks... to discover their eyes all fixed on... 
THE UTTERLY DECIMATED PRISON, engulfed in a massive conflagration as a STORM OF DEBRIS RAINS DOWN FROM THE SKY... 
Now seeing Caesar, Rocket and Bad Ape turn, stunned at the sight of him -- Caesar and Rocket begin to exchange emotional looks -- 
-- when MECHANICAL GROANS beside them make them all turn to see -- 
THE REMAINING ARMADA as it finally arrives, braking to a stop just 20 yards away... SOLDIERS, FACES ALL OBSCURED in heavy parkas and BALACLAVAS, are packed onto troop carriers, trucks and humvees, gazing in shock at the fiery camp -- when ONE notices... the apes. Others start to see them too... A moment suspended in time as ape and man all stare silently at each other... 
Then, the anonymous soldiers slowly begin to raise their weapons -- Caesar and the apes remaining totally still -- when --

SHOOTING DRAFT 
FADE IN: 
INT./EXT. A CAR (MOVING). NIGHT 
The shifting lights from the odd passing car play over the faces of MR. and MRS. PRESCOTT, a pleasant-looking couple in their late thirties, dressed up for a night out. Mr. Prescott drives them along a dark hilly two-lane highway. 
MRS. PRESCOTT Why do they always put braces on teenage girls at the exact moment when they're the most self-conscious about their appearance? 
Pause. 
MR. PRESCOTT I don't know. 
UP AHEAD, near the top of the oncoming hill, a RED PICKUP TRUCK is poking its nose out of the short exit lane. 
MRS. PRESCOTT Tom -- 
MR. PRESCOTT I see him... 
The PICKUP LURCHES into the road, with not nearly enough time to spare. 
MRS. PRESCOTT Tom! 
MR. PRESCOTT Jesus! 
Mr. Prescott swerves OVER the DOUBLE SOLID WHITE LINE and clears the truck as -- 
Another pair of HEADLIGHTS from an oncoming truck RISES UP over the HILL directly in FRONT of them -- 
MRS. PRESCOTT (Screams) Tom! 
Mr. Prescott's FOOT STOMPS on the BRAKE. We BLACK OUT and there is the SOUND of a terrible CRASH. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. THE PRESCOTTS' FRONT DOOR. NIGHT 
The SHADOW of a big man looms up onto the front door. A big finger RINGS the BELL. 
A moment. 
AMY, a thirteen-year-old baby-sitter with braces, opens the door and looks up. In the b.g. we see TWO CHILDREN, SAMMY (Samantha) and TERRY PRESCOTT, in their pajamas, lying on their stomachs in the living room, watching television. Sammy is eleven. Terry is eight. 
REVERSE: DARRYL, the SHERIFF, a portly fellow with glasses and a mustache, looks down at AMY. 
SHERIFF Hello, Amy. 
AMY (Puzzled) Hi, Darryl. 
SHERIFF (Thinking) Amy, would you please tell the kids you'll be right back, and then shut the door and come outside to talk to us for a minute? 
AMY OK. (To kids) Be right back, you guys! 
SAMMY You're not supposed to go out, Amy. 
TERRY She's going to smoke a cigarette. 
AMY closes the door and looks expectantly up at Darryl. Darryl doesn't know how to start. 
EXT. CHURCH. DAY 
CREDITS BEGIN OVER a blustery April day. The steeple of the little white church stands out against the sharp blue sky. 
INT. TOWN CHURCH. DAY 
It's a small church and a small congregation, but it's full. There's a CHOIR of mostly SENIOR CITIZENS arrayed in the back. TWO CLOSED CASKETS are laid out in front of the MINISTER, a fiftyish woman with thick glasses and salt-and- pepper hair, who is giving a eulogy MOS. 
SAMMY All right. 
BOB I'd be glad to give it some thought... 
SAMMY OK. 
He is smiling at her. 
SAMMY What? 
BOB Nothing... I'm just glad to see you... I'm glad you called me. 
SAMMY I bet you were surprised...! 
BOB Um -- a little. 
Bob drains his wineglass. Sammy cuts at her steak. 
INT. BOB'S BEDROOM. NIGHT 
Sammy and Bob lie in Bob's bed, a few minutes after having made love. They are very far away from each other, but trying with difficulty not to let on. 
SAMMY I should get going... 
BOB Really? 
SAMMY Yeah... I've got the baby-sitter... But... Thanks for a lovely evening. 
BOB Oh. Thank you. 
She kisses him. She tries to make it sexy, but he's not into it anymore and he politely restricts the kissing. 
INT. SAMMY'S BATHROOM. NIGHT 
Sammy stands in her slip brushing her teeth in front of the mirror. She brushes vigorously, looking at herself while she brushes. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. STREET CORNER -- WORCESTER, MASS. DAWN 
The corner window of a grim little apartment building on a very grim street in a grim little city. 
INT. TERRY'S APARTMENT -- WORCESTER, MASS. NIGHT 
A tiny apartment with a bed, chair, table, fridge, and not much else. One window has a broken pane and an old sheet neatly thumbtacked over it to keep the wind out. 
TERRY PRESCOTT comes in. He is twenty-five years old: a real mess with a certain natural appeal. He wears old jeans, very old hiking boots, and a lumberjack-style coat. He takes a wool hat off his head. His hair is longish and dirty. 
SHEILA SADLER is sitting at the table by the fridge. She is barely eighteen, frail and damaged. 
SHEILA Hey, Terry. 
TERRY Hey. 
Terry looks at her and smiles encouragingly. She smiles back. 
SHEILA Where'd you get the hat? 
TERRY Oh, I got it on the street for a dollar. 
SHEILA It's nice. 
TERRY Well, you know, it's pretty much your standard woolen hat. 
SHEILA Yeah, I had a very similar reaction to it. 
Sheila looks away. Silence. 
TERRY Can I get that money from you? 
SHEILA Yeah. Sorry. 
As she opens her purse, Terry takes a few vague steps toward her. She takes out a tiny hippie-ish woven wallet and gives Terry all the money in it: a twenty and two ones. 
EXT. SAMMY'S HOUSE. DAY 
Sammy practically bursts out the front door. She has changed into nice clothes. 
EXT. ALLEY. DAY 
Terry secrets himself in a small dark alley. He takes out his carefully wrapped half joint and lights it. SMOKING, he looks at the sunlit slant of street beyond the alley. 
EXT. MAIN STREET. A FEW MOMENTS LATER 
Terry, fairly well stoned, walks along Main Street. A skinny man emerges from his hardware store to greet Terry and shake hands. Terry says "Hi," but keeps on walking. He passes some other people. 
He almost runs right into SHERIFF DARRYL, sixteen years fatter and grayer. 
SHERIFF Whoa there! 
TERRY Sorry. 
The Sheriff recognizes Terry and breaks into a big smile. 
SHERIFF God damn! Terry Prescott! How you doin'? Gimme a cuddle! 
The Sheriff gives Terry a big bear hug. Terry is wasted and selfconscious but smiling. He pats the Sheriff's back. 
TERRY How you doin', Darryl? 
SHERIFF Which way you headed? 
TERRY I'm just goin' to see Sammy at Dawson's... 
SHERIFF Can I walk with you a little? 
TERRY Sure, yeah -- 
SHERIFF So Sammy says you been out in Alaska...? 
TERRY Yeah, I was workin' out there for a little while... 
EXT. MAIN STREET. A FEW MOMENTS LATER 
The Sheriff walks along with Terry. Terry, very self-conscious about smelling like pot, fumbles to light a cigarette. The Sheriff does not seem to notice. 
SHERIFF -- Sammy says she's gettin' postcards from all across the country. 
TERRY Yeah, I've been all over the place... 
They stop outside Dawson's. 
SHERIFF Well, it's good to have you back here, I'll tell you that. 
TERRY Thanks, Darryl. Keep enforcing the peace. 
SHERIFF Well, that'll be a little harder now that you're home, but I'll do what I can. 
TERRY No, man, I'm reformed. 
SHERIFF Oh, yeah. Good to see you, kid. 
TERRY Thanks, Darryl. 
Darryl walks away. Terry stands outside the restaurant looking for Sammy. 
Behind him in the restaurant Sammy is sitting at a table, talking to the waitress. 
She sees Terry and gets up immediately, smiling like crazy as she threads her way through the tables toward the door. 
Terry turns and sees her. He breaks into a big smile, tosses his cigarette and goes into the restaurant. Through the window we see them make their way toward each other. 
Sammy throws her arms around him. He hugs her back with a big involuntary smile as the GLASS DOOR slowly CLOSES. 
INT. DAWSON'S -- AT THEIR TABLE. A FEW MOMENTS LATER 
Terry is studying the menu, over-intently. Sammy is beaming at him. 
SAMMY You just keep looking around, that's all. 
TERRY No, I was just wondering if we could get some more refreshments, actually. 
He laughs. Looks down. Silence. He looks up at her. 
TERRY I've actually got to confess to you, Sammy... that the reason you may not have heard from me for a little while is that I've been kind of unable to write... on account of the fact that I was in jail for a little while. 
SAMMY You were what? 
A couple of people in the restaurant look at them. Terry notices but Sammy does not. 
TERRY Well, I did a little time, I guess, in Florida. For, uh, just for bullshit... 
SAMMY What?! 
TERRY It was just bullshit... 
SAMMY What did you do? 
TERRY I didn't do anything. Does it occur to you that maybe I was wronged? 
SAMMY No! 
TERRY Well, could I please -- 
SAMMY Oh my God! -- 
TERRY Would you please let me -- 
SAMMY -- What happened?! 
TERRY I got into a fight in a bar down in Florida. Which I was not the one who instigated it, at all. But they worked up all this bullshit against me and they threw me in the pen for three months. I didn't write you because I didn't want you to get all upset about it. I just figured you'd figure I was on the road for a little while. I know it was stupid and I'm sorry. I really didn't mean to make you worry. But you know what? I can't run around all the time doin' stuff or not doin' stuff because it's gonna make you worry! Because then I come back here, and I tell you about my fuckin'... traumas, and I get this wounded little "I've Let You Down" bullshit, over and over again, and it really just -- cramps me! Like I just want to get out from under it!... And here I am back in this fuckin' hole explaining myself to you again! 
SAMMY OK -- Can you please stop cursing at me? 
TERRY I mean, I realize I'm in no position to, uh, basically say anything, ever -- But it's not like I'm down there in some redneck bar in Florida having an argument with some stripper's boyfriend and I suddenly think, "Hey! Maybe this'd be a good time to really stick it to Sammy and get myself locked up for a few months." 
SAMMY I'm sorry. 
TERRY Me too, man. I mean "welcome home." 
SAMMY Hey -- You don't write me for six months, I have no idea where you are -- 
TERRY I'm sorry -- 
SAMMY -- I don't know if you're alive or dead -- 
TERRY I'm sorry -- 
SAMMY -- and then you show up out of nowhere and tell me you were in jail? 
TERRY I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Sammy, I'm really sorry...! 
The patrons are all either looking at them or trying not to look. Silence. 
TERRY Sammy... 
SAMMY What? 
TERRY Um... I'm in the midst of a slight predicament... 
SAMMY What do you need? Money? 
TERRY Um... Yeah... I'm broke. I gotta get back to Worcester tomorrow. I got this girl there, and she's kind of in a bad situation...? I just need to borrow some money. Whatever you can spare. (Pause) I'll pay you back... I'll pay you back, man. 
SAMMY I really wish Mom was here. 
TERRY So do I, man. 
SAMMY Nobody knows what to do with you. 
TERRY I know how they feel, man. 
RUDY They are? 
TERRY Well, yeah. Your mom is my sister. 
RUDY Yeah, I know. 
TERRY So that means we have the same parents. 
RUDY Oh yeah. 
They drive in silence for a moment. Terry glances down at Rudy. 
INT. BANK -- SAMMY'S DESK. DAY 
Sammy, laden with files, plops down at her desk as Mabel is passing by. Mabel puts a phone message down in front of her. 
MABEL Um -- Carol just called. She said Terry and Rudy never showed up at her house? 
SAMMY You've got to be kidding me. 
A MOMENT LATER: Brian, talking to an employee, sees Sammy, across the bank, hurrying out the employees' exit. 
BRIAN Hey, Sammy? 
Sammy doesn't hear and exits. 
EXT. ORRIN'S BACKYARD. DAY 
Terry and Rudy are banging nails with RAY, a young guy Terry's age. Terry, hammering with swift, accurate blows, glances up and watches Rudy for a second. Rudy is hammering away with no great skill. 
TERRY Hey. Look. 
He moves Rudy's hand down toward the end of the handle. 
TERRY You hold it further down, you're gonna get a lot more power. You should be able to put that nail down with two or three hits. Look: 
With two swift strokes he drives the nail flush into the wood. 
TERRY Try it. 
RUDY That's not the way I hold it. 
TERRY Well, the way you hold it is wrong. 
RUDY Why can't I just do it my own way? 
Terry looks at him unsympathetically for a moment. 
TERRY (Shrugs) You can. 
He goes back to work. Rudy resumes hammering. After a moment he switches his grip and starts hammering Terry's way. Terry looks up and watches him. 
EXT. IN FRONT OF ORRIN'S HOUSE. A MOMENT LATER 
Sammy pulls up, fast, and gets out of the car. Hearing the hammering from the backyard, she walks quickly around the side of the house and stops short when she sees Rudy hammering happily away with Terry and Ray. 
She watches them working, unobserved, with mixed annoyance and relief, and finally with quiet pleasure, because it's a very cheerful sight. 
INT. BANK. DAY 
Half the staff has gone home. Sammy, in her coat, picks a NOTE up off her CHAIR. It reads: 
"SAMMY, PLEASE SEE ME A.S.A.P!!! -- BRIAN" 
INT. BRIAN'S OFFICE. A MOMENT LATER 
Sammy stands in front of Brian's desk. 
SAMMY Brian? Did you want to see me? 
BRIAN Yeah. I was kind of wondering what happened to you today. 
SAMMY Oh -- Didn't Mabel -- I had a false alarm about my son... 
RUDY I won't. 
TERRY You know this used to be my room? 
RUDY Yeah... (Pause) Do you want it back? 
TERRY No. 
Rudy is very relieved. Terry keeps reading. Rudy watches him. 
RUDY Did you fight in Vietnam? 
TERRY No. I wasn't even born yet. 
RUDY Were you ever in the army? 
TERRY No. 
RUDY My father was in the army. 
TERRY I know. Unfortunately he didn't fight in Vietnam either. 
RUDY Were you friends with him? 
TERRY Not really. We had some friends in common, I guess... I didn't like him very much. 
RUDY Why not? 
TERRY Well, he wasn't very likable. 
RUDY Why do you say that? 
TERRY I don't know. He was always -- He always had to be better than you at everything. You know. Like if you were all playing basketball or something, everybody's havin' like a friendly game and he's like ready to kill somebody if his team didn't win. Or like if you told like a joke or a story, he always had to tell a better one? Kinda gets annoying after a while. Plus it was pretty scummy how he split on your mom and you... He was a prick. Probably still a prick. Fortunately for you though, your mom is like, the greatest. So you had some bad luck and you had some good luck. (Pause) You mind if I ask you a personal question? 
RUDY I don't know. 
TERRY Do you like it here? I mean, in Scottsville? 
RUDY Yeah...? 
TERRY Why? 
RUDY I don't know. My friends are here... I like the scenery... I don't know. 
TERRY I know, I know, but it's so... There's nothing to do here. 
RUDY Yes there is. 
TERRY No there isn't, man! It's narrow. It's dull. It's a dull, narrow town full of dull, narrow people who don't know anything except... what things are like right around here. They have no perspective whatsoever. No scope. They might as well be living in the nineteenth century because they have no idea what's going on, and if you try to tell 'em that, they wanna fuckin' kill you. 
RUDY What are you talking about? 
TERRY I don't know... 
Terry lies on his back and smokes. 
TERRY You're a good kid. 
INT. BANK -- SAMMY'S DESK. MORNING 
There's a NOTE on Sammy's chair. 
"SAMMY, PLEASE SEE ME -- BRIAN" 
Sammy, just arrived at work and still in her coat, looks down at the note. 
INT. BANK -- BRIAN'S OFFICE. DAY 
Sammy listens to Brian. 
BRIAN Yeah. This doesn't apply to you directly, Sammy, but I've noticed that some of the employees have their PC monitors set with all kinds of crazy colors... Purple and polka dots or what have you. And it's not a big deal, but really, this is a bank. You know? It's not really appropriate. So I'm just asking that people stick to a more quote unquote normal range of colors in future... 
Sammy looks at him blankly. 
SAMMY (To TERRY) So lights out at ten... and don't spend the whole night watching TV. 
TERRY Nice to meet you, Bob. 
BOB You too. 
TERRY (To SAMMY) What's your idea of the whole night? 
SAMMY Two hours tops. 
Bob holds the door for Sammy and smiles at her. There is some confusion about who should go out first. Finally she goes and Bob follows. The atmosphere between them is fairly awkward. 
INT. SAMMY'S HOUSE. NIGHT 
Terry and Rudy are watching TV from the sofa. 
TERRY What's your feeling about Bob? 
RUDY I don't really know him that well. 
Terry looks at his watch. 
TERRY I have bad news for you. 
He picks up the remote... 
RUDY No...! 
...and turns off the TV. They sit there in the sudden silence. 
RUDY Great. What are we supposed to do now? 
TERRY Do you know how to play pool? 
RUDY I've played it. 
EXT. THE WILD MOOSE. NIGHT 
The Wild Moose is a noisy roadside bar sitting under the stars. Terry and Rudy get out of the car. Rudy looks apprehensive. 
RUDY I don't think they let kids in there. 
TERRY Well, we're not allowed to watch any more TV, so it's this or nothing... But if we run into any trouble, let me do the talking. 
RUDY OK. 
Terry swings the door open. 
INT. THE WILD MOOSE. NIGHT 
POV RUDY: A lot of men and women at the bar or in booths, eating and drinking. Smoky, crowded and very loud. As he follows Terry through the crowd various patrons notice him -- some of the looks are friendly, some blank, some cold, i.e., what's a kid doing in here? 
AT THE POOL TABLE: Terry and Rudy stand side by side facing the players and waiting players gathered around the table. Terry waves a few bills. 
TERRY I got a hundred bucks here says me and my nephew can beat anybody in here. Only we gotta get the next game 'cause he's gotta be in bed by ten o'clock. 
A MOMENT LATER: RUDY, very nervous, and the 1st Pool Player are side by side shooting for break. Terry is behind Rudy coaching him. 
TERRY Just hit it nice and soft... Nice and soft. 
They hit the balls. Rudy just clips his ball and it doesn't go anywhere. 1st Pool Player's ball hits the opposite bank and comes almost all the way back. 
RUDY (To TERRY) Sorry. 
TERRY God damn, Rudy. I thought you said you could play. 
Rudy doesn't answer. Terry winks at him. 
A MOMENT LATER: 1ST POOL PLAYER BREAKS -- WHACK! -- The balls scatter. Nothing drops. TERRY steps up to the table, chalking up his cue. 
TERRY Boys, it's all over but the cryin'. 
QUICK CUTS: Of Terry running the table and everyone watching. Three-ball in the side. One-ball in the corner. Nine-ball off three cushions and into the corner, and the eleven-ball into the side. Rudy watches him. 
Rudy runs up the stairs. 
TERRY Wait a minute, gimme your jacket! 
Rudy tries to take his jacket off fast but gets his arm caught in the sleeve. He tries to shake it off. 
TERRY What are you doing? 
RUDY I can't get my sleeve out...! 
They HEAR Bob's CAR DOORS SLAM. Terry makes a comic panicked face and leaps up the stairs two at a time. 
OUTSIDE THE HOUSE: Sammy waves to Bob. Bob waves back as he drives off. Sammy goes to the front door, opens it: 
Terry and Rudy are in a giggly tangled panicked heap at the top of the stairs, shaking Rudy's arm and sleeve, frantically trying to get the jacket off. 
Sammy comes in. They freeze. 
SAMMY What is going on in here? 
TERRY Um -- We were just out doing some star-gazing, and, uh, Rudy lost track of the time. Which I totally warned him about. (To Rudy) You are a bad kid. 
INT. BATHROOM. LATER 
Rudy is brushing his teeth. Terry pokes his head in. 
TERRY (In a low voice) Hey: I think it's OK. Just don't tell her where we went, 'cause she'll be really mad at me. OK? 
RUDY I won't. 
TERRY (Suddenly dark) Hey -- I'm not kidding, Rudy. 
RUDY I won't! 
Terry gives him a "You better not" look, then leaves. Rudy continues brushing his teeth. 
INT. RUDY'S ROOM. NIGHT 
Sammy is tucking Rudy in, stroking his hair. 
SAMMY Did you know my Mommy used to take me and Uncle Terry out at night to look at the constellations? 
RUDY Yeah. 
SAMMY Did you see that one, what's the one -- It looks like a big "W"? Cassiopeia? 
RUDY Yeah. 
INT. HALL. NIGHT 
Sammy comes out of Rudy's room, smiling. It's dark. She sees a LIGHT on under TERRY'S DOOR. She walks toward it and steps into the TRENCH, falling down violently. 
SAMMY Ow! Shit! 
INT. BATHROOM. NIGHT 
Terry is putting a butterfly Band-Aid on Sammy's wound. It's a nasty, bloody gash, just shy of needing stitches. 
SAMMY I've got a great idea. Why don't you let me call the plumber? 
TERRY Do whatever you want. 
SAMMY Oh, does that make you mad? 
TERRY No... 
INT. SAMMY'S ROOM. NIGHT 
RAIN patters on the ROOF as Sammy LIMPS back and forth across the room changing into her nightgown. 
EXT. TERRY'S WINDOW. NIGHT 
Terry is smoking pot with his head and shoulders stuck outside the window. RAIN FALLS on his HEAD. 
EXT. BUS STOP. DAY 
RUDY is WAITING in a doorway for Terry. He is wet and cold. The RAIN pours down. 
INT. BANK. DAY 
Brian is showing his wife, NANCY, the bank. He is very solicitous of her, nervously introducing her to the employees, who are not responding very warmly. Nancy is not in a warm mood either; she's very testy with Brian. 
BRIAN This is Chuck. Chuck, this is my wife, Nancy. 
CHUCK Hello. 
NANCY Nice to meet you. 
BRIAN This is Mabel... 
MABEL Hi. 
NANCY Nice to meet you. 
SAMMY, at her desk, watches Brian and Nancy make their progress through the bank. Nobody is being very friendly, and Brian suddenly seems awkward and vulnerable. Brian and Nancy reach Sammy's desk. 
BRIAN This is Sammy, our lending officer. Sammy, this is my wife, Nancy. 
SAMMY (Friendly) Hi. It's nice to meet you. 
NANCY Brian -- I gotta sit down. 
BRIAN Sure -- Let's go in my office. 
He glances nervously at Sammy as he leads Nancy away from her desk and toward his office. He murmurs something to Nancy, who responds in a low but very testy voice: 
NANCY I'm fine...! 
She roughly pulls her arm away from his. Sammy watches them go into his office. 
EXT. MAIN STREET. DAY 
Rudy trudges resolutely through the pouring rain toward the center of town. He is completely drenched. 
INT. BRIAN'S OFFICE. DAY 
Sammy knocks on Brian's open door. 
SAMMY Brian...? 
BRIAN Yeah. 
RUDY (O.C.) Mom! 
Sammy sees to her left, down the hallway -- 
SAMMY Rudy! 
Rudy is at the end of the hall, drenched and shivering, but cheerful. 
EXT. EMPLOYEE PARKING LOT. DAY 
Rudy is in the car, somewhat dried off, waiting. Sammy and Terry stand in the employee entrance doorway. 
SAMMY Look, I'm glad you guys are getting along so well -- like, you have no idea -- but if I can't rely on you to remember to get him once a day... 
TERRY You can! 
SAMMY -- And what are you doing taking him to play pool in the middle of the night, and then telling him to lie to me about it? 
Pause. 
TERRY I don't know. 
INT./EXT. SAMMY'S CAR/CAROL'S DRIVEWAY. DAY 
Terry and Rudy pull up in front of the driveway. Terry is in a silent rage. The rain has let up. 
She leaves. Sammy and Brian pick up their shots. 
BRIAN Well, here's to improved employee- management relations. 
SAMMY Amen. 
They click shot glasses and drink. 
SAMMY You can't judge all of Scottsville by the people in that bank, believe me. 
BRIAN Well -- Let's -- Let's not talk about the bank. 
SAMMY OK. 
BRIAN Let's just forget about the bank for tonight. 
SAMMY Good idea. 
They sip their drinks, smiling. Sammy looks at him appraisingly. 
INT./EXT. BRIAN'S CAR/WOODED ROAD. NIGHT 
Sammy and Brian are making out in the front seat of his car. This goes on for a while, getting heavier and heavier. 
BRIAN Sammy? 
SAMMY Yeah? 
BRIAN I want you to tell me who changed the colors on my computer screen. 
SAMMY I'll never tell. 
They start kissing again in the cramped space. Brian bangs his head. They laugh. 
EXT. OUTSIDE THE CAR. CONTINUOUS 
We pull back and away from the car. The sodden trees spout faucets of water down on the car. 
INT. KITCHEN. NIGHT 
The kitchen is dark. Sammy comes in, her hair a little wet, and turns on the light. She goes to the telephone. 
There's a NOTE in Terry's handwriting: 
"BOB CALLED." 
TERRY (O.C.) Where were you? 
Sammy jumps, startled. Terry is in the kitchen doorway. 
SAMMY Nowhere. I had dinner with my boss. 
TERRY Kind of a late dinner, ain't it? 
SAMMY Yeah. How was Rudy? 
TERRY Fine. 
SAMMY Did the plumber come? 
TERRY Yes, the fucking plumber came. 
SAMMY Terry -- Give me a break!!! 
Pause. 
TERRY What's the matter with you? 
SAMMY Nothing. I'm just tired. 
TERRY You want to smoke some pot? 
SAMMY No I don't. Why, you got some? 
Brian kisses her. She drops her folders and they make out against the door. 
OUTSIDE THE OFFICE: The employees click away at their PCs. Mabel exchanges a quiet word with Chuck. 
INSIDE THE OFFICE: Brian has Sammy pressed against the wall with her skirt hiked up and is trying to get both of their underwear out of the way. It's not so easy in their office clothes. Sammy tears away. 
SAMMY Brian, that's enough. 
BRIAN falls back, breathless. 
BRIAN OK. Sorry. 
He lunges at her again. They kiss some more. 
OUTSIDE THE OFFICE. A MOMENT LATER: Sammy comes out of the office, more or less composed, carrying her folders. She heads down the hall past the other employees, including Mabel, and surreptitiously readjusts her scrunched-up underwear. 
INT. DAWSON'S. DAY 
Sammy and Bob sit at lunch. Sammy is picking at her food. 
BOB You're awfully quiet. 
SAMMY I'm sorry. 
BOB Um... Have you thought at all about what I said? 
SAMMY Of course I've been thinking about it. 
BOB So... Any decisions? Or -- do you still want to think about it some more...? 
SAMMY Well -- I mean -- I don't know, Bob. I mean, we haven't exactly been going steady the last few months, if you know what I mean -- 
BOB Yeah, no, I know -- 
SAMMY -- and then we see each other twice and you suddenly say you want to get married? I mean... 
BOB No, you're right, you're right -- 
SAMMY What are you talking about? 
Pause. 
BOB I don't know... I... Maybe this is... Last year I sort of thought you were possibly interested in that... idea... but I was the one who, you know, wasn't "ready" at that point -- So that's why I thought things kind of slowed down with us... 
SAMMY Don't make me feel bad for you. 
BOB (Bristling) I don't want you to feel bad for me. 
INT. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT 
Sammy, Terry and Rudy are all watching TV. Sammy and Rudy are in pajamas. Nobody's happy and nobody's talking. 
The PHONE RINGS. Sammy goes to it and picks up, surprised because of the hour. 
SAMMY (Into phone) Hello? 
BRIAN (On phone) It's Brian. 
Sammy turns away and lowers her voice so Terry and Rudy won't overhear her. 
SAMMY Brian. Where are you? 
EXT. GAS STATION. SIMULTANEOUS 
Brian is on the pay phone outside a gas station. 
BRIAN I'm buying milk. I just thought I'd say hello. 
WE CUT BETWEEN THEM. Sammy doesn't say anything. 
BRIAN Look, I know it's probably too late, but is there any way you can come out for a little while? 
SAMMY Brian, I think you're going crazy. 
The SUN SHINES on Main Street. 
INT. SPORTING GOODS STORE. DAY 
Rudy watches wide-eyed as Terry places on the sales counter two rods and reels, a bunch of lures, two fishing hats, a box of swivels, a knife and a fish scaler. 
TERRY You know who this is for? 
RUDY Me! 
TERRY That's right, my little friend. (To the saleslady) Hello. We're going fishing. 
INT. SAMMY'S HOUSE -- KITCHEN. DAY 
Sammy, Terry and Rudy are all putting away the groceries. Everybody seems to be getting along. 
RUDY I got a new rod and reel, five lures, I got a hat, I got a knife and I got a fish scaler. 
SAMMY That's great, honey. 
O.C., the DOORBELL RINGS. Sammy starts to move toward the door, but Terry is closer. 
TERRY I'll get it. 
Sammy watches him go. 
INT./EXT. FRONT DOOR. DAY 
Terry opens the door. It's Ron, the minister, in his civvies. 
EXT. FRONT YARD. DAY 
Rudy is playing basketball by himself. 
INT. SAMMY'S HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM. DAY 
Terry, Sammy and RON sit in the living room. Sammy and Ron are drinking coffee. Through the window we see occasional glimpses of Rudy playing basketball in the backyard. There is a heavy silence in the room. 
TERRY Well... I'm not really sure why you're here, Ron. I mean, I realize I haven't exactly been a model citizen since I got here, but compared to how things have been goin' for me lately, I thought I was doing pretty well. 
He turns to Sammy. 
TERRY And I also find it kind of discouraging that you seem to think I need some kind of spiritual counseling or what have you, so much so that you're willing to disregard the fact that I don't believe in any of this stuff at all -- 
SAMMY Well... I didn't mean to discourage you -- 
TERRY I mean it's really kind of insulting. 
RON Can I say something here? (Pause) Sammy asked me to come and talk to you, because it's her opinion that you're not gonna find what you're looking for the way you're looking for it -- 
TERRY How would she know? 
RON But I'm really not here to try to get you to do anything, or to believe anything. And I'll tell you the same thing I told her, which is that as far as I'm concerned the only way she can help you is by her example -- by trying to be a model for you, by the way she lives her life... 
Terry smiles. 
RON And that doesn't mean she's supposed to be a saint, either, if that's what you're smiling about. 
TERRY I didn't realize I was smiling. 
A moment. 
RON You know, Terry, a lot of people come to see me with all kinds of problems. Drugs, alcohol, marital problems, sexual problems, health problems -- 
TERRY Great job you got. 
RON Well... I like it. Because even in this little town, I feel like what I do is very connected with the real center of people's lives. I'm not saying I'm always Mr. Effective, but I don't feel like my life is off to the side of what's important. You know? I don't feel my happiness and comfort are based on closing my eyes to trouble within myself or trouble in other people. I don't feel like a negligible little scrap, floating around in some kind of empty void, with no sense of connectedness to anything around me except by virtue of whatever little philosophies I can scrape together on my own... 
TERRY Well -- 
RON Can I ask you, Terry: Do you think your life is important? 
TERRY You mean -- Like, me personally, my individual life? 
She throws the sheets at him and storms away. Terry walks through the living room and OUT the front door, SLAMMING it behind him. 
INT. SAMMY'S ROOM. NIGHT 
Sammy sits by the phone in her bathrobe. She picks it up and DIALS. 
INTERCUT: BRIAN'S LIVING ROOM. NANCY, watching TV on the sofa with Brian, picks up the RINGING PHONE. 
NANCY (Into the phone) Hello? 
SAMMY HANGS UP. She gets up, walks around, sits down again. Picks up the phone and DIALS. It RINGS. 
INTERCUT: BOB'S KITCHENETTE. Bob, making a sandwich for himself, picks up the phone. 
BOB (Into the phone) Hello? 
SAMMY HANGS UP. Pause. She sweeps the TELEPHONE and ANSWERING MACHINE OFF the nightstand. Pause. She calms down and puts them back. The ancient answering machine is CLICKING convulsively. She WHACKS IT and it stops. 
EXT. CHURCH. DAY 
The congregation is coming out of the church and milling around at the steps. SAMMY, with Rudy at her side, is saying good-bye to some neighbors. She watches pregnant NANCY and BRIAN go down the steps. 
POV SAMMY: Beyond Brian and Nancy, TERRY pulls up at the curb in her car. He rummages around and produces FISHING RODS which he waves, somewhat sheepishly. 
REVERSE: At top speed, Rudy runs away from Sammy and the church, toward Terry and the car. Terry and Sammy exchange a look from the distance. 
EXT. RECTORY. DAY 
Services are over. Everyone has gone home. 
INT. RON'S OFFICE. LATER 
Sammy sits with Ron. 
SAMMY Anyway... I don't know what the church's position is on adultery and fornication these days, but I felt really hypocritical not saying anything to you about it before, so... What is the official position on that stuff these days? 
RON Well... it's a sin. 
SAMMY Good: I think it should be. 
RON ...but we don't tend to focus on that aspect of it, right off the bat -- 
SAMMY Why not? 
RON Well -- 
SAMMY I think you should. 
RON Well -- 
SAMMY Maybe it was better when you came in and they screamed at you for having sex with your married boss, and were really mean to you, and told you what a terrible thing it was. Maybe it'd be better if you told me how I'm endangering my immortal soul, and if I don't quit I'm going to burn in hell. Don't you ever think that? 
RON Um... No. 
SAMMY Well, it's a lot better than all this "Why do you think you're in this situation" psychological bullshit you hear all the time. 
RON Well... Why do you think you're in this situation? 
SAMMY With which one? 
RON All of them. 
Pause. 
SAMMY I feel sorry for them. (Pause) Isn't that ridiculous? 
Ron shrugs: i.e., "not necessarily." 
EXT. STREAM -- BRIDGE. DAY 
Terry and Rudy are side by side on a small footbridge over a wide running stream, fishing. The sunlight slants through the canopy of trees; the birds are chattering; it's gorgeous and peaceful. 
RUDY I've never been so bored in my life. 
SAMMY Well -- I don't know... 
BOB I don't know. Sammy, I love you. I wish I could say it in a more interesting way. I just -- I love you. 
SAMMY Well -- I mean -- I love you too -- 
He puts his arms around her and kisses her. She responds very warmly. Just as things are heating up, she suddenly remembers something and jolts away. 
SAMMY Oh shit. 
BOB What's the matter? 
SAMMY I gotta go. I'm sorry -- 
BOB Where do you have to go? 
SAMMY (Off the top of her head) I'm supposed to -- I gotta get Mabel back her car. 
BOB Well... I don't understand. How are we leaving things? 
SAMMY Oh God, I don't know. Call me later. 
INT. MOTEL. DAY 
Brian sits on the edge of one of the beds watching some daytime Sunday show on the motel TV. There is a knock at the door. He gets up, turns off the TV and opens the door. It's Sammy. 
SAMMY Sorry I'm so late. 
BRIAN Yeah, I was just about to give up on you. 
SAMMY Well -- maybe it would've been better if you had... 
She comes into the room and starts walking around briskly and nervously. 
SAMMY I mean -- Look, I don't mean to be unsympathetic about your domestic situation, whatever it is, but I'm just beginning to think that if people tried a little harder to stick to their commitments and started taking a little responsibility for their actions, they might end up having a lot less trouble generally. That's all. 
BRIAN Hey, that's what I've been trying to tell you guys at the bank. 
SAMMY Well, I really don't think I can do this anymore. 
BRIAN OK. 
INT. MOTEL ROOM. LATER 
Brian and Sammy lie under the starchy sheets. Brian's eyes are shut. Sammy is very upset with herself. 
SAMMY This is incredible. 
BRIAN Mmmm. 
SAMMY That is not what I mean. 
INT. SAMMY'S CAR (MOVING). DAY 
Terry and Rudy drive along. Terry looks down at Rudy and smiles. Rudy is tense and won't look at him. 
OVER TERRY AND RUDY'S SHOULDERS as Terry drives slowly past dilapidated little houses in a very depressed residential area. Terry is scanning the house numbers. 
RUDY Maybe we should call first. 
TERRY Well -- We're right here. 
He pulls up outside a small, plain, run-down ranch-style house with a lot of junk out front, and gets out of the car. Rudy stays in. 
TERRY Come on. 
Rudy gets out of the car and comes around. Terry waits for him, and then they walk up to the front door. The buzzer says "KOLINSKI." 
TERRY There he is. 
RUDY His last name is Kolinski? 
TERRY Yeah. Ring the bell. 
TERRY I just wanna -- 
RUDY SR. Do you know what you're doin'? Just get outta here! 
TERRY You know what, man? You're still a fuckin' asshole. 
RUDY SR. I'm an asshole? Get outta here! 
Rudy Sr. shoves Terry. Terry belts him, and suddenly they are throwing wild punches at each other. Rudy goes sprawling in the dirt. 
Terry knocks Rudy Sr. down and starts pummeling him brutally. Janie comes out of the house and jumps on his back, trying to pull him off. 
JANIE Get your fuckin' hands off him...! 
Terry throws Janie off him, grabs Rudy Sr. again and resumes beating him up. Janie jumps back on top of him. 
Two neighbors run toward the melee to break it up. 
CUT TO: 
A FEW MOMENTS LATER: The cops have arrived. The 1ST COP is talking to Rudy and Janie. The 2ND COP is talking to Terry. Rudy Sr.'s face looks puffy and beaten up. A 3RD COP stands apart with Rudy, who is watching the whole thing. WE CUT rapidly and jerkily through this section: 
1ST COP And you're not the boy's legal guardian? 
RUDY SR. I don't even know if that's my kid! 
JANIE They just showed up! We never seen them before... 
RUDY SR. I used to know his sister -- 
TERRY I just came down here to talk to the guy and all of a sudden he starts shovin' me! 
2ND COP Listen up. Listen up. You're gonna have to step back and just calm down -- 
TERRY (To RUDY SR.) You're a lyin' fuckin' piece of shit. 
2ND COP (To TERRY) You're gonna have to step back. 
JANIE We have a right to protect ourselves. What else do you need to know? 
A MOMENT LATER: The 2ND COP puts handcuffs on Terry. Rudy watches. 
2ND COP Now give me your right hand... 
TERRY This is such bullshit. He started the whole thing and you're arresting me? 
2ND COP Listen up. Now -- Listen up! Stop talkin'. Terry, stop talkin'. 
CUT TO: 
A MOMENT LATER: As the 3RD COP walks Rudy to one cop car, Rudy watches the 2ND COP guide the HANDCUFFED TERRY into the other car. 
Rudy gets in the back of the car and looks out at RUDY SR. and JANIE talking to the 1ST COP. Rudy Sr. is looking at him over the 1st cop's shoulder. 
2ND COP -- idea where we might be able to contact his mother? 
RUDY SR. No, because he's not my Goddamn kid. 
The cop cars' doors slam first on Terry and then on Rudy. 
INT. MOTEL ROOM. NIGHT 
The room is dark. Sammy and Brian are asleep, half under the covers. SAMMY WAKES with a START. 
SAMMY What time is it? 
BRIAN (Startled awake) What's the matter? 
Sammy looks at the clock radio. 9:20. 
SAMMY Oh my gosh. 
A FEW MOMENTS LATER: Sammy and Brian are on opposite sides of the bed, getting dressed. 
Brian walks through the morning bank activity and stops at Mabel's desk. 
BRIAN Anyone hear from Sammy this morning? 
MABEL I didn't. 
BRIAN Uh huh. Well, if anyone ever hears from her ever again, will you let me know? 
MABEL Yes. 
EXT. AUBURN POLICE STATION. DAY 
On the steps of the police station, Sammy, Rudy and Bob wait as Sheriff Darryl shakes hands with the Auburn Sheriff. The Auburn Sheriff goes inside. Darryl comes over to Sammy. 
SHERIFF It's gonna be all right... We got on the phone and talked to Rudy Sr. a little bit and he's calmed down, just wants to forget about the whole thing... 
SAMMY Darryl, I really appreciate this... 
The Sheriff nods, but he's not thrilled to be here. 
INT. SAMMY'S LIVING ROOM. DUSK 
The PHONE IS RINGING. Sammy comes in the front door, Terry and Rudy behind her. She snaps on the lights, hurries to the phone and picks up. 
Behind her, Rudy goes upstairs and Terry plunks down on the sofa and turns on the TV. 
SAMMY Hello? 
INTERCUT WITH BRIAN, AT THE BANK. 
BRIAN Yeah, it's Brian. 
SAMMY Brian -- 
BRIAN What the hell happened to you today, lady? 
SAMMY is about to answer, but she just HANGS UP instead. 
BRIAN is stunned into sheer gaping fury. Feverishly he hangs up and dials again. It RINGS. 
Sammy picks up. 
SAMMY Hello? 
BRIAN You're fired! 
SAMMY GOOD! 
She hangs up again. 
INT. RUDY'S ROOM. NIGHT 
Sammy is tucking Rudy into bed. 
SAMMY Rudy? 
RUDY Yeah? 
SAMMY Is there anything you want to ask me, about your father? 
RUDY Oh, that wasn't my father. 
SAMMY What? 
RUDY That wasn't him. I heard him tell the cops. 
SAMMY No -- Rudy -- that was him. But that was him. I wish it wasn't, but it was. 
RUDY (Very quiet) No it wasn't. 
SAMMY Rudy. Yes it was. Your father's name is Rudy Kolinski. He lives in Auburn... 
INT. HALLWAY. NIGHT 
SAMMY I didn't know if you left yet. 
TERRY No -- I'm leavin' tomorrow. 
SAMMY Well -- What time? 
TERRY There's a bus at nine. 
SAMMY Well -- Can I -- I'd like to see you before you go. I mean, can I give you a lift? Or do you want to have breakfast or anything? And I think Rudy would really like to say good- bye. 
TERRY Yeah -- I don't know... I mean -- 
SAMMY Terry, you can't just leave like this. I -- 
TERRY All right, all right. I'll come by in the morning. 
SAMMY All right -- But just -- We have to be out of the house by eight, so -- I don't want to tell Rudy you're coming unless you really think you can make it -- 
TERRY Yeah -- No -- I'll be there. 
SAMMY All right. 
TERRY All right. 
INT. KITCHEN. MORNING 
Sammy is clearing the breakfast dishes. Rudy is finishing up his cereal. The clock reads 7:50. 
SAMMY You should get your sneakers on. 
EXT. HOUSE. A MOMENT LATER 
Sammy comes out and looks up and down the road. 
INT. LIVING ROOM. A FEW MOMENTS LATER 
Rudy sits in the living room in his baseball jacket. His knapsack is on the floor beside him. He looks at the CLOCK: 8:06. Sammy comes into the living room and looks at him. 
SAMMY Sweetie, I'm sorry, we have to go. 
RUDY Why can't I miss school one day? 
They HEAR the PICKUP PULL UP OUTSIDE, O.C. Rudy gets up immediately. 
EXT. THE HOUSE. A MOMENT LATER 
Terry jumps out of RAY'S PICKUP. Sammy opens the front door and Rudy runs out toward Terry. 
RUDY Hi! 
TERRY Hey, how's it goin', man? 
Rudy stops short in front of Terry. Terry looks at Sammy, in the doorway. 
TERRY Sorry I'm late. 
EXT./INT. CAR. DAY 
The car stops across the street from the BUS. The LAST KIDS are getting in. SAMMY HONKS for the bus driver, and Sammy, Terry and Rudy all get out. 
TERRY So Rudy... If I write you a letter, will you write me back? 
RUDY Yeah. 
TERRY OK, well, that's gonna be pretty nice for you, because I write a pretty Goddamn interesting letter. 
RUDY Yeah, we'll see. 
TERRY All right. Well, say good-bye. 
RUDY Bye. 
Rudy hugs Terry. Terry hugs him back. He is suddenly overcome and presses his lips to the top of Rudy's head.

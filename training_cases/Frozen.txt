EXT. MOUNT HOLLISTON - DAY                                    1 Peace. 
Fresh snow glistens in the sunlight and reflects off of the giant pine trees covering the serene mountain side. 
It's quiet. 
So quiet. 
HARD CUT TO: 
FROZEN 
HARD CUT TO: 
2   EXT. THE CHAIR LIFT - DAY                                     2 Tight on a gloved hand as a lever is released. 
Tight on the cables at the top of a rickety chair lift as they kick into motion. 
Wider as an empty chair swivels around and beneath the asses of a threesome of SKIERS. 
Even wider to reveal a long line of Skiers and SNOWBOARDERS awaiting their moment to step up to the chair. 
The camera finds a group of three standing off to the side of the line, decked out in their winter gear. 
3   EXT. SNOW BANK OVERLOOKING THE CHAIR LIFT - CONTINUOUS        3 
Angle on DAN WALKER (college age, shaggy hair, holding a snowboard and a helmet in one hand) as he studies the situation. Next to him stands an impatient JOE LYNCH (college age, goggles on his head and a face full of fresh stubble, standing on skis). 
LYNCH I don't see her. 
DAN The shift change is late.   Just wait. 
PARKER O'NEIL (college age, red hair, holding a snowboard) sighs and stares back at the lift lane. 
PARKER Are you sure about this? 
DAN We've been doing this forever. Trust me. This lady loves Lynch. She always goes for it. 
Lynch smiles at Parker. 
LYNCH I'm cute. 
Just then, JASON (a ski mountain employee) approaches the front of the line and excuses the employee working the chair. 
PARKER Is um... is that her? 
DAN Shit. 
LYNCH Dude. 
DAN It's cool, it's cool. (to Parker) Look, all you have to do is smile real pretty and tell him- 
PARKER -What?   Me? No way.    This is your thing. 
DAN 
Parker, listen, listen. It's so easy. All you do is tell the guy that you and your friends- 
LYNCH -GIRLfriends. Say "girlfriends". 
DAN -you and your girlfriends forgot your credit card and you can't pick up your lift tickets. 
He grabs a wad of cash out of Lynch's glove and shoves it in Parker's hand. 
DAN (cont'd) Start at $50. That's what we usually give the other lady. He'll take it. Trust me. 
PARKER Dan, no.   You do it.    I feel stupid. 
DAN You've got this.    You can totally do this. 
LYNCH Parker, you've so got this. 
DAN The worst thing that happens is he says no. He won't say no. No one ever says no. 
PARKER Why me? 
LYNCH `Cause you're a girl. 
DAN A very beautiful girl with a very charming smile. (then) 
A -I watched the game with you last week! 
LYNCH For ten minutes, Dan. Football games are more than ten minutes. 
M They're lots of ten minutes-es, you know? 
DAN Dude, I have a girlfriend now. I love this girl. I don't know what you... 
D LYNCH No, no it's fine. I'm just saying, the Mount Holliston day trips were our thing, you know? She doesn't even know how to board yet. 
E DAN She's getting better. (then) Now I feel like a dick. You should have said something if it was a problem. 
LYNCH It's not a problem. It's not. Forget I ever said anything. 
They see Parker hand Jason something. He pockets it and she glides her way back to the end of the line. 
She looks up at the guys waiting on the hill and then excitedly waves. Proud of herself. 
Dan smiles at Lynch. 
6   EXT. CHAIR LIFT LINE - CONTINUOUS                             6 Lynch and Dan join Parker and slowly work their way up the line. 
X DAN Good work!     See?   They always go for it. 
R PARKER I did good, right? 
LYNCH You did great. 
A DAN Oh, so where's my change? 
PARKER There isn't any. 
M DAN You gave him the full hundred? 
PARKER He wasn't going for it at 50. 
DAN 
D So what happened to the other fifty numbers in between there? Like, I don't know, $51 or maybe even $75? 
PARKER 
E You gave me two 50's. What was I supposed to do, ask for change? 
LYNCH I would have asked for change. 
PARKER It's still way cheaper than paying for tickets, right? 
Dan is disappointed. 
LYNCH I would have definitely asked him for change. 
They get up to the front of the line.    Jason looks at Dan and Lynch behind Parker. 
JASON (scoffs at Parker) "Girlfriends"? 
X Parker gives him an apologetic smile. 
The three get in front of the chair. It descends under them and scoops them off of the ground into the air. 
R 7   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - MOMENTS LATER                                 7 The threesome float high above the mountain as the chair slowly makes it's way to the top. 
A DAN Look at that. See? All these other idiots are paying top dollar to ski. Not us. All thanks to you, baby. 
M PARKER (teasing) Oh, now I'm "baby"?     You never call me pet names. 
DAN I'm just not a `pet name' guy. 
D PARKER (to Lynch) He calls me "Parker." 
E DAN It's your name. 
PARKER Yeah but you're supposed to call me something affectionate, you know? Like "honey" or "sweetie". 
LYNCH I hooked up with a girl last semester that called me by my last name in bed. It was so weird. "Oh, Lynch! Your hair is so soft! Do me harder, Lynch!" It was like I was throwing it to Dan over here. 
Dan looks back to Parker. 
DAN See? At least I don't call you "O'Neil". 
PARKER You don't touch my face enough either. 
X Dan laughs. 
LYNCH (to no one imparticular) 
R Third wheel. 
DAN 
E Look at you! See?   Having fun? 
PARKER Are you kidding? We are totally doing this every weekend. In fact, if they were open during the week I'd say we should cut class, too. 
Lynch suddenly flies over the hill and sprays both of them down with powder. 
LYNCH Last one to the bottom is buying dinner! 
He eats it mere seconds later and lands on his ass. 
Parker and Dan take off laughing while Lynch feebly tries to get back on his feet. 
10   INT. SKI LODGE - EARLY EVENING                            10 Parker gets herself some hot chocolate in the distance while 
X Dan and Lynch pick at what's left of a pizza on the table in front of them. 
DAN We gotta take a weekend trip up 
R North one of these days. Hit up Killington or Okemo and really do it up right. 
LYNCH 
A Why don't we just do it over Christmas. You and me. 
DAN Done. When I stayed with my cousin out West two years ago it was like 
M the stuff you see in commercials. We had to take like 3 lifts to get to the top and it was powder as far as you could see. 
LYNCH Well, speaking of good skiing... it's been cool doing the bunny hill 
D all day but do you think we could get one real run in before we leave tonight? 
Dan feels bad. 
E DAN Dude, you didn't have to stay with us. It's totally cool if you want to go off for a few. 
Parker is now walking back to their table behind Lynch and is pretty much right on top of them. 
LYNCH No, it's fine. I'm just saying let's step it up a notch at some point. It's been cool watching Parker fall on her ass all day but I would like to actually ski at some point. 
Parker feels horrible. 
PARKER You know, I've probably had enough for today anyway. I can just stay in the lodge if you guys want to go- 
X Now Lynch feels horrible. 
LYNCH -no, no, no that's not what I meant. I didn't mean it like that. 
R Parker looks to Dan. 
PARKER I told you I didn't have to come. 
A LYNCH Parker, I didn't not want you to come. 
Dan tries to help. 
M DAN It was his idea that we invited you in the first place. 
LYNCH Exactly. Remember? I was like "Hey man, why doesn't Parker come 
D with us?" And you were like- 
DAN -I was like, "OK that would be cool". 
E Parker isn't buying it.   She puts on a smile. 
PARKER It's OK, you guys. The last thing a girl wants to do is intrude on "guy time". I won't be offended. I've got stuff I could do anyway. (to Dan) Actually, can I have the key? I should check my messages. 
DAN No. No locker key. I can tell you right now that every message on there is going to be from your Mom giving you more aggravation about whatever the hell. 
X Parker laughs. 
PARKER She does not. 
R Dan looks to Lynch. 
DAN Ready for this? Two nights ago we were watching a movie and her Mom 
A kept calling and calling. (to Parker) And what did she want? 
Parker laughs. 
M DAN (cont'd) She wanted to know if we wanted to have chicken soup or vegetable soup with Christmas dinner. Christmas dinner! Four weeks away, and she had to now right then and there what kind of soup we'd prefer. 
D LYNCH What did you say?   You said chicken. 
M He puts a red flag on the back of a chair that heads up the mountain. 
DAN But we gave you a hundred bucks and we've only gotten like 4 runs! 
D JASON It's not my decision, man.    They're closing early. 
DAN 
E You're only open three days a week. You can't afford to close early. 
JASON Why don't you write a letter? 
Lynch pushes himself up behind them. 
LYNCH (to Dan) Remember "429". 
DAN What? 
LYNCH Just remember "429". (to himself) 
PARKER (to Jason) 
X Come on, just one more run. 
JASON Sorry. 
R DAN Honestly, I'd slide you some more money but we gave you everything we have. 
A LYNCH (to Jason) Hey man, do you have a pen? 
Jason ignores him. 
M JASON It's not about the money. They need to clear the mountain. We've got weather coming in. There's nothing I can do. 
PARKER What if we promise to run straight 
D down. Like the quickest run ever. 
DAN Wicked fast. 
E Jason struggles. He sighs and looks around.        There are still plenty of skiers coming down. 
JASON Fine. But hurry. DAN                              PARKER Thank you!                           Thank you so much! 
DAN We'll be wicked fast.    Like the wind! 
Jason sends them up the lift.    He checks to make sure no one is watching. 
13   EXT. CHAIR LIFT    - MOMENTS LATER                        13 Parker, Dan, and Lynch slowly move up the mountain yet again. 
LYNCH Seriously. For a hundred bucks 
X you'd think he could cut us some slack. 
DAN I know right? They're supposed to 
R stay open until 10 on Sundays. Whatever happened to night skiing? 
LYNCH Wachusett still has night skiing. 
A We should have gone there. It's kinda like Ward Hill but not as lame. (then) Hey, you remember the numbers I told you? 
M DAN 
PARKER Good for you, Lynch.   You got her number! 
D DAN What did He-Man have to say about that? 
LYNCH 
E That guy? Who cares? Steroids shrink your dick. (then) Wait, shit. What were my four numbers? "5022". Parker, will you remember "5022"? 
PARKER Nope. 
14   EXT. CHAIR LIFT LINE - CONTINUOUS                         14 Jason reaches for his cigarettes.    He's all out. 
Disappointed he tosses the empty pack in the trash. 
A fellow employee (RIFKIN) approaches. 
RIFKIN Early night, huh? 
JASON You're not gonna hear me complain. 
X RIFKIN Pendergraft wants you to stop by the office.   Something about next weekend's schedule. 
R JASON I'm not working next weekend. 
E DAN It's the mountains.    It snows every night. Relax. 
The chair moves on in silence for a few moments. 
PARKER Seriously. I'm gonna eat a whole pizza. (a few beats) I'm not even kidding. 
18   EXT. CHAIR LIFT LINE - MOMENTS LATER                      18 Rifkin kicks his feet around. He spies Jason's discarded cigarette box on the top of the trash and he inspects it for any left over cigarettes. 
X Nothing. 
He sighs. 
Just then, the three skiers that we saw taking the jump a few 
R minutes earlier come flying down the mountain and past him. 
A voice from the top lift cuts through the radio. 
VOICE (O.S.) 
A Last chair is through. 
Rifkin picks up the radio and calls the top of the mountain. 
RIFKIN Cool. Last three just hit.   I'm 
M clear. 
VOICE (O.C.) Clear up here. 
He hangs up and moves over to the lever. 
Tight on the lever as he pulls it back towards him. 
D 19   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - CONTINUOUS                              19 The chair lurches to a stop. Once again, the comforting 
E white noise of the motorized cables goes away, leaving them in silence. 
The wind blows hard against them. 
DAN Oh, come on. 
Parker instinctively grabs his hand. 
The cold bites through their layers of clothing. 
PARKER Bur! 
LYNCH (yelling to the sky) IT'S FRIGGIN COLD UP HERE!   NO TIME FOR THIS CRAP! THANK YOU! 
They sit and wait in silence for a few seconds. 
X PARKER It's gonna start again, right? 
DAN (quickly) 
R Yes. (then) Anyone got any jokes? 
LYNCH 
A What did the fourteen year old girl from New Hampshire say to her father when she lost her virginity? 
DAN "Get off me, you're crushing my 
M Marlboros". 
Beat. 
LYNCH I told you that? 
CUT TO: 
D 20   EXT. MOUNT HOLLISTON - MOMENTS LATER                         20 From this distance the mountain looks like a giant night- 
E light of converging white strings. 
Even in this darkness, the menacing clouds are visible over the trees. 
CUT TO: 
21   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - CONTINUOUS                                 21 The three sit in the freezing chair.   Lynch is really getting impatient. 
DAN What do you think the worst way to die would be? 
PARKER That's not morbid. 
LYNCH Yeah, seriously.    That's kinda spooky, Dan. 
LYNCH I kind of just shat in my pants a bit, I'm not gonna lie. 
X DAN HE-LLO!!!!!!!!!!!???? 
Parker is starting to shake. 
R PARKER (quietly) No one knows we're up here.    They forgot that we're up here. 
A DAN No they didn't. They couldn't have. I'm sure they have a system or something. There's probably security cameras on us right now. 
M He starts waving around his hands. 
DAN (cont'd) HEY ASSHOLES?! START THE CHAIR!!! WE'RE FREEZING UP HERE!!! 
PARKER What if they don't start it again? 
D What if everyone went home? 
DAN (angered out of panic) Will you stop?! 
E (recovering) They didn't go home. Stop freaking me out. (then) Remind me to knock down that fucking lift operator when we get down. This is horse shit. 
LYNCH What did you say to the guy? 
DAN Me?   Nothing! 
LYNCH Well, clearly you pissed him off enough to do this. 
DAN I didn't do anything!   He knows we're still up here. 
PARKER Then why are the lights off, Dan? Is that part of their policy? Shut 
X off the lights and scare the customers? 
DAN They just lost power or something. 
R I'm sure it's gonna come back on any second. (then) They didn't go home. That's retarded. 
A After a few more moments. 
LYNCH This is so messed up. 
M DAN It's a power outage. They'll come up with a ladder if they have to. 
Parker is starting to whimper. In a few more seconds she may even be teetering on full-on panic. 
PARKER 
D We need to get down from here. We can't just sit up here. Why isn't the goddamn chair moving, Dan? What the hell?! 
E DAN Well you being all psycho about it isn't gonna make it move. Just chill out. 
Another few beats. 
PARKER Don't yell at me. 
DAN I wasn't yelling at you but you need to relax. This stuff happens all the time. Can you imagine the law suit if they left everyone on this lift up here all night? 
LYNCH Free lift tickets. 
PARKER What other people on the lift? There was no one in front of us. 
X She made a good point.   But still... 
DAN We won't be stuck here all night. 
R PARKER No. You're right. We won't be here all night. It's Sunday. (she starts crying) Its fucking Sunday and they aren't 
A open again until Friday. (sobbing) We'll be stuck here all week. 
Silence as Dan and Lynch take this in. 
M PARKER (cont'd) We're gonna die up here. 
Lynch tries to be the voice of reason. 
LYNCH We're not going to be stuck here. Parker. Parker, look at me. Even 
D if by some strange reason they really did forget us up here- we can jump. I see people jump off of chair lifts all the time. 
E DAN It's true. I've done it before. You just get tired of waiting, you wait for a spot with some serious powder and you just jump. It's actually kind of fun, but they can ban you from the mountain for it. 
Looking below them, it is way too far a drop to be jumping off of the chair. 
PARKER (hysterical) -HELP!!! SOMEBODY PLEASE HELP US!!!! HEL-LO!!! HELP!!!!! 
She cries into Dan's shoulder. 
The wind blows hard as their flimsy chair swings back and forth in the foul weather. 
R Parker sobs quietly into Dan's shoulder. 
LYNCH SOMEBODY GET US DOWN FROM HERE! 
A HELP! 
DAN (quietly) Put the safety bar down, Joe. 
M LYNCH SOMEBODY PLEASE HELP US! 
DAN (louder) Put the bar down. 
LYNCH 
D SOMEONE- 
DAN PUT THE BAR DOWN! 
E Lynch pulls the bar down and sulks, looking away from Dan. 
The hail/sleet mixture keeps pelting against their skin as they sit together in silence. 
Another loud thunder clap hits.   This time, much closer. 
CUT TO: 
22   EXT. MOUNT HOLLISTON - MOMENTS LATER                          22 The sleet begins to ice over the leaves and vegetation below. 
Ski tracks fill in with the wet rain. 
CUT TO: 
23   EXT. MOUNT HOLLISTON - MOMENTS LATER, WIDER                  23 The entire mountain is covered in dark clouds. 
CUT TO: 
X 24   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - MOMENTS LATER                              24 The three stranded kids huddle together for warmth as the hail pours down around them in sheets. 
R Suddenly, a beam of light begins to shine up at them. 
Dan's head snaps up. 
A CUT TO: 
25   EXT. MOUNT HOLLISTON - CONTINUOUS                            25 A Snow Cat slowly makes it's way down the hill towards the 
M bottom. It's headlights shine across the trees in front of it. 
CUT TO: 
26   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - CONTINUOUS                                 26 
D Dan begins to cheer. 
DAN What did I tell you guys, huh?   WOO- HOO! UP HERE! 
E PARKER Oh, thank God. 
CUT TO: 
27   EXT. MOUNT HOLLISTON - CONTINUOUS                            27 The Snow Cat is now really close.   It is literally coming right for them. 
CUT TO: 
28   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - CONTINUOUS                                 28 Dan and Parker wave their hands in the rain. 
PARKER UP HERE! 
X DAN HELLO! 
CUT TO: 
R 29   EXT. BELOW THE CHAIR - CONTINUOUS                            29 The Snow Cat continues on right underneath them.   It doesn't 
A look like it's going to stop. 
CUT TO: 
30   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - CONTINUOUS                                 30 
M Panic sets in yet again. 
PARKER Why isn't he stopping? 
LYNCH HEY!   WHAT THE HELL?!! 
The moon shines down on the mountain.     It glistens like a block of ice. 
Silence. 
CUT TO: 
X 38   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - CONTINUOUS                                   38 The three shiver uncontrollably. 
R Finally. 
PARKER My face is burning. 
A DAN The power is coming back on soon. 
PARKER No it isn't. 
M DAN It has to. 
The wind makes eerie sounds as it whistles through the frozen trees. 
DAN (cont'd) Anyone know what time it is?    I 
D don't wear a watch. 
LYNCH Me neither. I use my phone. Hold on, let me just run back to the 
E locker real quick and I'll find out. 
No one laughs at his attempt at "humor". 
LYNCH (cont'd) OK, top 3 breakfast cereals of all time. Go. 
Silence. 
LYNCH (cont'd) I'll go first. 
PARKER Stop. 
LYNCH Crunch Berries... 
PARKER Please, stop. 
LYNCH 
X Apple Jacks... 
DAN Dude, quit it. 
R LYNCH ...and I'm gonna go out on a limb and say Lucky Charms pre-purple horseshoes. 
A Silence. 
LYNCH (cont'd) There's just something weird about eating purple horseshoes, am I right? 
M Silence. 
PARKER Everyone went home.    They left us up here. 
More silence. 
D LYNCH Top 3 celebrities you'd do. (then) Me first again? Fine... 
E DAN Someone has to jump. 
They steal glances at each other.    They are soaked through. Parker's hair is frozen. 
DAN (cont'd) We can't just sit up here until next weekend. We'll die. 
No one acknowledges him. 
He sighs and closes his eyes. 
Parker starts to cry.   Neither of the guys even try to console her. 
Finally, Dan puts an arm around her. 
DAN (cont'd) Shhh.   It's OK. 
LYNCH SOMEBODY HELP US!! 
X His voice is getting hoarse. 
PARKER (aside to Dan) 
R I don't want to die up here. 
DAN (aside to Parker) You're not gonna die, baby. I 
He positions himself to try and jump off.     Parker grabs his arm. 
PARKER No, no, no. Please don't jump down there, Dan. You'll get hurt. 
LYNCH How are you going to find your way in the dark? 
DAN I'll stick to the trail. I'll ride to the bottom. 
X (then) You don't get a fresher run than this, right? 
Dan drops his snowboard down. 
R It lands sticking up straight in the snow. 
DAN (cont'd) OK. 
A Parker and Lynch look back at him.      They don't know what to say. 
Lynch tries to grab on to Dan's arm. 
M LYNCH Walker, no. 
Dan shrugs free.    He is determined.    Concentrating. 
DAN One. 
D Parker's tears are freezing on her cheeks as the seconds tick by. 
DAN (cont'd) ...Two. 
E Lynch takes a deep breath. When enough time has elapsed to think Dan's gonna jump, he suddenly looks up at Lynch instead of jumping. 
DAN (cont'd) Remember when I was saying how I jumped off one of these things before? 
Lynch stares back at him. 
DAN (cont'd) I totally lied. I'm scared shitless right now. 
Lynch musters a laugh.      It's forced, but it's a laugh. 
Dan laughs back at him. He turns to face Parker.    She tries to smile but is frozen with fear. 
Dan whispers to her... 
DAN (cont'd) (whispered) 
X You're gonna be OK, baby. 
...and he is gone. 
From his point of view (the camera pointed down at his feet) 
R we drop (without cutting) from the chair all the way to the frozen ground below. 
CUT TO: 
A 39   EXT. BELOW THE CHAIR - CONTINUOUS                             39 CRACK! Both of Dan's legs shatter from the impact. Viscera protrudes out of his snow pants as his leg bones shoot out the top of his knees. 
M DAN AHHH!!     OH MY GOD!   AHHHH!!!! 
CUT TO: 
40   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - CONTINUOUS                                  40 
D Parker calls down to him. 
PARKER DAN!   DANNY? Oh my god! 
E Dan's cries turn to quiet breaths below them. It is tough for Parker and Lynch to make out what exactly is happening. 
LYNCH Dan, say something.     Are you alright? 
More quiet breaths from below. 
Finally... 
DAN (O.C.) My legs.    I broke my fucking legs. 
LYNCH Oh, shit. 
PARKER Can you move? Dan? (she starts to panic) Hold on. Hold on, baby. 
Lynch stops her. 
X LYNCH What are you doing? 
PARKER I gotta...I have to get to him. 
48   EXT. BELOW THE CHAIR - CONTINUOUS                                48 The scarf lands right next to Dan. 
DAN What do I do with this? 
LYNCH (O.C.) Tie it over your leg. Tie it off above wherever it's bleeding. Like a tourniquet thing. 
Dan fumbles with the scarf and ties it just above his right knee as tight as he can. 
X DAN I'm so cold. 
CUT TO: 
R 49   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - CONTINUOUS                                 49 Parker starts to take off her coat. 
A PARKER Here, take my coat. 
DAN (O.C.) No! Don't you take off your coat! 
M You need it! 
PARKER No, I'll be OK. I can huddle next to Lynch. Please- 
CUT TO: 
D 50   EXT. BELOW THE CHAIR - CONTINUOUS                            50 DAN -Parker, keep your coat on. 
E Dan takes off his snowboarding gloves and ties the elastic strings together. His fingers are so numb that it takes several tries. 
Once tied, he tries to stretch the gloves around his left knee, but it is useless. 
DAN (cont'd) Shit! 
LYNCH (O.C.) Dan, buddy. You gotta let us throw something down so you can stop the bleeding. 
DAN I...I've got it. 
PARKER Are you sure. 
Dan's left leg is definitely still bleeding. 
X DAN Yup. 
Thunder shakes the mountain side. 
R Moments pass with only their breathing. 
LYNCH (O.C.) Are you sure you can't try and get 
A down the hill, buddy? 
Dan falls onto his back, panting from the pain.   He struggles to flip himself over, but it hurts too much. 
DAN 
M No, man.   I can't move.   I can't move. 
CUT TO: 
51   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - CONTINUOUS                                 51 
D Lynch holds his head. 
LYNCH Alright.   Hold on. 
E Once again, Lynch starts looking all around.   Above, below. 
LYNCH (cont'd) Maybe...if I could climb up to the lift cable? Maybe I could like, scale across to the other chairs until I find one that isn't quite so high up from the ground? 
PARKER You think you can pull yourself across that many chairs? 
Lynch looks back at her. 
LYNCH I can't even do a pull-up. 
DAN (O.C.) You never even tried to do a pull up you asshole. You had your Mom write you a note to get out of climbing the rope in gym cause you're a pussy. 
X LYNCH There was no reason to embarrass myself. I knew I couldn't do it. 
DAN (O.C.) 
R You can too. Remember Jenny Bluth? She fucking did it. You can do it. 
LYNCH Even if I made it across to the 
A next chair...how many more would it take before I found one closer to the ground? 
DAN (O.C.) Every lift pole has an emergency 
LYNCH (cont'd) Hey...go like this. 
X He motions wiping his face. 
Parker follows suit, but winces in pain. 
PARKER 
R Ow!   It feels like...like sunburn. 
Pieces of her chapped skin are stuck to her icy glove. 
LYNCH 
A I'm not an expert but I think that's frost bite. 
PARKER What? 
M LYNCH Look at me- is my face changing color anywhere? 
Parker looks as closely as she can. 
PARKER I don't..I can't see anything.    I 
D don't know, it's too dark 
She starts rubbing at her cheek again. 
LYNCH 
E No!   Stop touching it.   Don't touch it. 
PARKER But it itches now... 
LYNCH I know- but if you keep touching your face it's gonna rub off. 
Parker is terrified. 
LYNCH (cont'd) Just try and cover your face.    Try and stay warm. 
Staying warm is absolutely impossible. Parker hides her exposed hand deeper inside her wet jacket. 
Icicles dangle from the bottom of the chair and their clothing. 
DAN (O.C.) 
X (winded) You gotta move faster up there. 
LYNCH I'm trying man, I'm trying. 
R Lynch slowly lifts himself up onto the back of the chair, which bends at an awkward angle. 
From above him we can see the long drop down, and as he 
A slowly starts to maneuver his body up to the top of the chair arm- the height looks `stomach droppingly' scary. 
PARKER Careful. 
M LYNCH Stop talking. 
DAN (O.C.) Lynch.   I think the- 
LYNCH DAN, STOP TALKING. 
D Silence. 
Lynch gets his gloved hands around the top of the cable.    It is frozen over with a thick layer of ice. 
E The distance to the next chair seems about 10 times as far now. 
LYNCH (cont'd) (to himself) I can do this. If Jenny Bluth could climb the rope, I can totally do this. 
Slowly, he wraps his arms around the wire, now with his full body weight on the back of the chair. 
The bolt holding the arm into place on the cabling starts to creak. It bends slightly, but seems to hold firm. 
LYNCH (cont'd) OK.    OK.   OK. 
He starts to pull himself up onto the cable. 
PARKER Don't look down. 
X With one hand in front of the other, Lynch hoists himself about two feet off of the chair and into the air. 
LYNCH 
R (gritted teeth) Slippery. 
LYNCH 
M Yup. 
PARKER I bet you guys will be really happy. 
LYNCH 
D 68   EXT. BELOW THE CHAIR - CONTINUOUS                          68 A wolf settles in the bushes and looks up at the two "pieces 
E of food" on the chair high above. 
Another wolf lays down in the snow by a tree. 
They wait like vultures. 
69   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - CONTINUOUS                               69 Silence.   Then... 
PARKER Who names their dog "Steve". 
LYNCH I will. 
PARKER Steve's a "people" name. 
LYNCH Says who? 
PARKER 
X You don't like walk into someone's house and have them say "Here's my dog Steve." 
LYNCH 
R Why not?    Steve's a good name for a dog. 
PARKER "Here, meet my cat Chris." 
A LYNCH No cats.    Just a dog.   Steve. 
Silence. 
M PARKER Shayna must be so hungry. 
Lynch tries to change the subject. 
LYNCH What kind of pizza should we get at Papa Gino's? 
D Parker doesn't hear him. As she continues, wet snow starts to fall around them and the icy wind starts to pick up. 
PARKER 
E The poor thing. She's just a puppy. She won't understand that I died. She's gonna think I left her. That I forgot about her. All she wants is for me to come home. She's probably waiting by the door for me right now. Every sound she hears in the hallway she's probably cocking her little head to the side, waiting to see if I'm going to walk in. But I won't. I won't ever walk in. And Shayna's going to starve to death. The poor thing is gonna wither away and die waiting by the door for me and it's all my fault. 
LYNCH She won't starve to death and you're not going to die. 
PARKER No one else has a key to my place. 
X LYNCH The neighbors will break the door down if she doesn't stop barking. Someone will figure it out. She'll be fine. 
R (beat) And so will you. So will we. 
He puts an arm around her and huddles closely trying to shield the wind. 
A PARKER I would have had Shayna for a year this month. I got her a year ago for Christmas. 
M LYNCH I know.   But you'll see her again. 
PARKER Dan and I were spending Christmas with my parents this year. We won't be there though. (then) 
D I want to see my Mom and my Dad. (then) I want to open presents in the morning and then wait for my grandmother to show up so we can 
E eat. She's always late. But she brings all of the desserts. And she makes this special hot apple cider thing with cinnamon and nutmeg. It's so good. And after dinner my Dad always passes out on the couch `cause it's his one day off and he's had too much eggnog. And my sister, my Mom, and I watch A Christmas Story until the marathon is over. And that's how you know Christmas is really over. When Ralphie gets his Red Rider carbine-action two-hundred-shot range model air rifle that last time and they go back to their regular programming. (MORE) PARKER(cont'd) It's kind of sad because then you know you have to wait another year for Christmas again. (then) It's the same routine every year. (then) I just want to see my Mom and Dad. 
X The camera pulls back wider and wider until their chair is lost in the wet snowfall and darkness. 
Slowly we fade to black as the wind howls and thunder gently rolls... 
R FADE TO BLACK. 
FADE IN: 
A 70   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - THE NEXT MORNING                           70 Dawn is breaking over the trees. 
Lynch and Parker are still. Their bodies are huddled 
M together, but neither is moving. 
In fact, at a first glance, one might think they are both human popcycles. 
PARKER Besides.   No one knows we're here. 
LYNCH (to the sky) HEL-LO!!! WE NEED HELP!!      HELP!!! 
X His voice echoes off of the frozen trees, almost as if taunting him. 
He turns around to look at the chairs behind him. 
R LYNCH (cont'd) Alright. Look. If I can get to that chair...two back...I could make it to the ladder on that pole. I think I could make it down. 
A Parker doesn't speak. 
LYNCH (cont'd) Help me. 
M PARKER Are you sure you don't just wanna give it a few more hours? What if you're right? What if someone is going to come up here, even though they're not open today? 
Lynch doesn't respond. The look on his face says that "no 
D one is coming" but he decides there's no harm in waiting just a little while longer. 
Lynch tries to yell for help again, though his soar throat is making it almost impossible to scream. 
E LYNCH UP HERE!   SOMEONE HELP US! 
Once again...only echoes. 
He re-settles in his chair. 
PARKER I just wish I could stand up. Get out of this position for a minute. 
LYNCH If you want, you can stand on the chair and I can hold onto you. 
PARKER No.     I can't. 
LYNCH Well, if anything's gonna get you over your fear of heights, it's this. 
X PARKER (quickly, sternly) No. I'm fine. 
R LYNCH Alright. 
CUT TO: 
A 71   EXT. CHAIR LIFT LINE - LATER                                     71 The bottom of the mountain looks like it has been abandoned. 
Empty ski racks. 
M An empty lodge. 
An empty parking lot. 
A still chair lift. 
All covered in white, still snow. 
D CUT TO: 
72   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - LATER                                          72 
E Lynch is sleeping. His head is leaned to one side in a position that is sure to give him the worst stiff neck he's ever had. 
Parker is ancy.    She looks all around.   Thinking. 
Finally she squeezes her eyes shut...embarrassed. 
Her snow pants turn dark around her bottom. Slowly a puddle of urine forms on the chair between her and Lynch. 
Below them, the urine falls into the snow and disappears. 
Parker's eyes swell as she begins to cry what's left of her tears. She is emotionally degraded and devastated. 
As her nose begins to run, she instinctively wipes her hand across it...taking a small piece of the dead flesh off of her cheek with it. 
She doesn't even feel it. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
X 73   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - LATER                                        73 They both sleep. 
R Finally, Lynch stirs and checks Parker to see if she is still breathing. 
It appears she is not. 
A LYNCH Hey...hey Parker... 
He lightly shakes her. 
M Nothing. 
X PARKER High School doesn't count. 
LYNCH 
R No, post-high school.   Freshmen year. 
PARKER Who? 
A LYNCH This girl Annie. I met her at orientation. We emailed all summer and when we started school, it was like we were already going out. I 
M totally just felt it with her, you know? We were into a lot of the same stuff, which was cool. She was way into Aerosmith. I had seen them fifteen times, she had seen them twenty. How cool is that? 
PARKER 
D What happened? 
LYNCH She um... same favorite movie as me. E.T. It was like soul mates 
E and that stuff you read about. 
PARKER So then... what happened? 
LYNCH Same old shit. (then) No. You know what happened? She liked another guy. This fucking fraternity douchebag named Dean who kept sending her flowers and stuff. I don't know who it was exactly, but every time I'd go to her room some guy named "Dean" had left her notes and shit. 
PARKER Why did she keep it? Was she trying to make you jealous? 
LYNCH I don't know. I think she just liked getting attention. 
X PARKER So she dumped you for a frat guy? 
LYNCH 
R No. I dumped her. We were in the cafeteria, right? And I was sitting facing her, facing the wall...and she was facing everyone in the cafeteria behind me. And I 
A kept seeing her smiling at someone behind me and like, almost laughing. So I was like, "who are you laughing at?" You know? Like "what the hell is going on?" And she's like, "Dean's making fun of 
M you." (beat) So I turn around, and I'm like ready to kick the shit out of this guy. And all I see is a sea of fucking random people. Just all of these faces. This guy could see me and was making eyes with my 
D girlfriend...but I couldn't see him. 
PARKER That's messed up. 
E LYNCH I've never felt so stupid and bad in my life. (then) So I left. 
PARKER You just walked out? 
LYNCH Yup. Told her to go laugh with "Dean the Frat guy". I was out. 
PARKER That sucks. 
LYNCH Maybe... maybe I shouldn't have been so quick to walk out. Maybe I needed to have a thicker skin and not be such a sensitive bitch, I don't know. Sometimes I think I was just insecure and maybe I 
X screwed up. 
PARKER You should call her. When you get home. You could tell her that. 
R LYNCH I can't. (laughs) She's dating Dean. 
A Emotion has fought it's way to the surface again.   Parker and Lynch share a nervous laugh together. 
She turns away from him. 
M After a few seconds, her laughs turn to tears. 
PARKER I should have done something. 
LYNCH There was nothing either of us could have done. 
D PARKER I sat here and let him die. 
LYNCH 
E No, you didn't. We didn't let him die. There was nothing we could have done. He jumped down there to try and save us, OK? 
PARKER He was the one. He was the boy I was gonna marry. 
LYNCH Funny story. First grade, we all get left there for the day by our mom's. You know, alone in real school for the first time without our folks around. And Dan... Dan was this sort of chubby kid when he was little... 
Parker laughs. 
LYNCH (cont'd) Nah, fuck it. He was a fat ass. 
Parker laughs harder. 
X LYNCH (cont'd) And all the mom's left and he just wouldn't let go of his mom's hand. He just stood there after she left, at the front of the room, crying 
R like a total pussy. 
The metal arm above her groans under the pressure that the one remaining bolt is under. Looking at the arm in this state, it is especially eerie to imagine how these metal chairs even stay attached to the cables in the first place. 
Lynch takes another move forward. 
LYNCH Rrrugh! 
PARKER You can do it. Please do it. 
Lynch reaches forward again...and his hand slips on the icy cable. He momentarily hangs by one arm. 
LYNCH 
X Arrrrr! 
PARKER JOE! 
R He reaches up and grabs hold again...his strength is weaning. 
LYNCH (through gritted teeth) Got it. 
A Another few quick reaches forward and he is more than halfway across to the next chair. 
From Lynch's point of view we can see his feet floating above the earth and hear the sound of his own heart beat. His own 
M pained breathing fills his ears. 
It's only now that he sees two of the wolves watching him from the bushes. 
LYNCH (cont'd) Motherfucker. 
D The wind blows hard against him, swaying his body back and forth as he momentarily rests. 
LYNCH (cont'd) I've got an audience. 
E Parker looks down, just in time to see one of the wolves duck back into the bushes. 
Her movement makes the chair groan harder. The cable twangs loudly between Lynch's shaky movements and the twisted metal that holds the arm in place. 
PARKER The chair is gonna fall! 
LYNCH No.    No it's not. 
Slowly he makes his way the remaining distance and positions himself over the other chair. 
He drops down onto it, sending shards of ice cascading down into the snow below. 
He quickly sits down, breathing heavy and clutching the sides of the chair. 
LYNCH (cont'd) 
X Take that Jenny Bluth! 
PARKER You made it! 
R LYNCH Not yet.   Halfway. 
He looks behind him at the next chair. Just a few feet back from it is the giant green lift pole... and a ladder! 
A LYNCH (cont'd) Please. 
He stands up on the chair and reaches up to the cable.   He is weak. 
M Very weak. 
LYNCH (cont'd) Parker. I want you to throw my extra pole as far as you can this way. 
D She can't quite hear him. 
PARKER What? 
E LYNCH I said THROW MY POLE AS FAR AS YOU CAN THIS WAY. When I get on the ground I'll need some defense. 
Parker nods. 
She takes Lynch's ski pole and tries to throw it as far as she can back at him. 
The action forces another terrifying metallic groan from the arm above her, and her chair swings back and forth from the motion. 
PARKER Oh shit. 
The pole lands under the second chair, splitting the distance between where she is and where the tree is. 
PARKER (cont'd) Sorry. 
LYNCH 
X Hey. Halfway to me is better than up there with you, right? (to himself) Shit. 
M waits. 
PARKER LYNCH!? LYNCH!!! (then) ANSWER ME!!! 
The wolf leader begins a dangerously slow and cautious walk 
D towards Lynch's body. 
One step at a time. 
CUT TO: 
E 78   EXT. BELOW THE CHAIR - CONTINUOUS                              78 As the camera tracks away from the approaching wolf and towards Lynch...it is revealed that he is only winded. 
He feels his body for damage, wincing at what can only be a broken rib or two. His right arm is twisted at an odd angle and by the look on Lynch's face, it must be either broken or fractured in addition to being dislocated. 
LYNCH PARKER. 
PARKER (O.C.) ARE YOU OK? 
The wolf surveys the situation and stops in his tracks. 
The other wolves watch from the bushes. 
LYNCH I'M GONNA GO GET HELP.       I'M GONNA GET RESCUE. 
X CUT TO: 
79   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - CONTINUOUS                                    79 
R PARKER Hurry.   Please. 
CUT TO: 
A 80   EXT. BELOW THE CHAIR - CONTINUOUS                               80 Lynch gets himself to his feet. His body is in massive pain, but his adrenaline is going strong enough for him to fight 
M through it. 
He moves quickly back up to the area underneath the middle chair. 
The leader growls. Drool drips down from beneath it's hungry mouth as it takes a step back. 
D PARKER (O.C.) NO!   JOE! 
LYNCH I'M GONNA GET YOU HELP! 
E The wolf leader advances on Lynch. 
Lynch makes it to the ski pole just in time and brandishes it defensively at the creature. 
LYNCH (cont'd) Come on!     Try something, fucker! 
The wolf stares back at him, growling.      Their eyes are locked. 
Lynch swings the pole at it angrily. 
LYNCH (cont'd) COME ON! 
The leader shies away but growls harder. 
LYNCH (cont'd) STAY AWAY! 
SNAP! 
X A second wolf rushes Lynch from behind and grabs his injured arm by the jacket and pulls back and forth. 
LYNCH (cont'd) ARGH! 
R The rest of the wolves quickly reveal themselves in the bushes and slowly saunter up towards the impending kill. 
CUT TO: 
A 81   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - CONTINUOUS                                 81 Parker looks from Lynch to the ground way below her. 
M PARKER (crying) JOE! 
CUT TO: 
82   EXT. BELOW THE CHAIR - CONTINUOUS                            82 
D Lynch tries to fight off the wolf with his free arm. 
Finally, he is able to plunge the ski pole deep into the wolf's body. 
E The wolf SHRIEKS in pain and scampers away towards the safety of the pack. 
The impending wolves, stop their slow march and wait.   This food still has some fight left in it. 
WHIRRR! WAP! No longer attached with the safety bolts, the 
R chair falls several feet and then stops. It is now hanging only by the one weak thread of cabling that was used to initially wire it to the main line. 
Parker's hands catch at the base of the chair, and she is 
A dangling fully beneath it. 
While it is still a long drop...her feet are now a good 10 feet closer to the ground, if not more. 
CREEEEEK! The metal wire will not hold for more than a few 
M seconds. The chair is going to fall! 
Parker closes her eyes. 
All sound cuts out except for her quick breathing and her heartbeat. 
The camera shows us how much the last flimsy wire does not 
D like this movement as it stretches and the chair sways in the wind. 
Slowly she looks down and prepares herself to fall. 
E The camera inches closer in to her face from below. 
Her heartbeat and breathing are all we hear until finally... 
She let's go. 
As her body falls from the chair, the flimsy wire finally gives way and the rickety metal seat plummets straight down to the ground after her. 
CUT TO: 
87   EXT. BELOW THE CHAIR - CONTINUOUS                             87 THUD! Parker lands hard and sound instantly returns to her. She rolls to the side as the chair crashes down in her very spot. 
X She is in tremendous pain but feels the solid ground beneath her like a sailor who has found land for the first time in years. 
Surveying the damage- her ankle is badly broken underneath 
R the side of the chair that landed on it. Her boot is at an unnatural angle. 
Adrenaline overtakes her pain as she lifts the chair up and removes her foot from beneath it. 
A She looks around for her snow board, but with all of the fresh snowfall it is buried and gone. 
Parker lays her body down flat on her jacket and begins to push herself down the mountainside as quickly as she can. 
M CUT TO: 
88   EXT. JUST OVER THE HILL - MORNING, CONTINUOUS                 88 Parker comes down the hill, gaining some speed on her awkward coat/sled. 
D As she makes her way she spots a tree... with bright red blood splayed out in the snow around it. 
Cautiously she slows herself down. 
E PARKER (meekly) Joe...? 
From Parker's POV, the camera slowly reveals what is just beyond the bloody tree... 
But the look on Parker's face tells us everything we need to know first. 
There, in the brush on the side of the trail beyond the tree, is the pack of wolves. 
Some still feeding.   Others resting attentively. 
They are circled around Lynch's bloody, half-eaten remains. 
Quick shots of his jacket, his boots, and his gloved hand all flash before Parker's devastated eyes. 
She slows herself to a complete stop now.   Not knowing what to do. 
One of the feeding wolves hears this and looks back to see 
Parker just a few feet away. It is the pack leader. 
Lynch's blood pools from it's jaws. 
It's ears go back and it growls loudly at Parker. 
R She makes eye contact with the beast, who stares back at her, almost daring her to try and take it's treasure. 
Others from the pack look up, distracted briefly, but then go back to feeding. 
Parker and the pack leader lock eyes. 
Finally, the leader turns away from Parker, back to his food.

SCREEN BLACK 
JACK (V.O.) People were always asking me, did I know Tyler Durden. 
FADE IN: 
INT.  SOCIAL ROOM - TOP FLOOR OF HIGH RISE -- NIGHT 
TYLER has one arm around Jack's shoulder; the other hand holds a HANDGUN with the barrel lodged in JACK'S MOUTH. Tyler is sitting in Jack's lap. 
They are both sweating and disheveled, both around 30; Tyler is blond, handsome; and Jack, brunette, is appealing in a dry sort of way.  Tyler looks at his watch. 
TYLER One minute. (looking out window) This is the beginning.  We're at ground zero.  Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion. 
JACK ... i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin... 
JACK (V.O.) With a gun barrel between your teeth, you only speak in vowels. 
Jack tongues the barrel to the side of his mouth. 
JACK (still distorted) I can't think of anything. 
JACK (V.O.) With my tongue, I can feel the rifling in the barrel.  For a second, I totally forgot about Tyler's whole controlled demolition thing and I wondered how clean this gun is. 
Tyler checks his watch. 
TYLER It's getting exciting now. 
JACK (V.O.) That old saying, how you always hurt the one you love, well, it works both way. 
Jack turns so that he can see down -- 31 STORIES. 
JACK (V.O.) We have front row seats for this Theater of Mass Destruction.  The Demolitions Committee of Project Mayhem wrapped the foundation columns of ten buildings with blasting gelatin.  In two minutes, primary charges will blow base charges, and those buildings will be reduced to smoldering rubble.  I know this because Tyler knows this. 
TYLER Look what we've accomplised. (checks watch) Thirty seconds. 
JACK (V.O.) Somehow, I realize all of this -- the gun, the bombs, the revolution -- is really about Marla Singer. 
PULL BACK from Jack's face.  It's pressed against TWO LARGE BREASTS that belong to...BOB, 45, a moose of a man.  Jack is engulfed by Bob in an intense embrace.  Bob weeps openly. 
JACK (V.O.) Bob had bitch tits. 
PULL BACK to wide on... 
INT. CHURCH MEETING ROOM - NIGHT 
Men are paired off, hugging, talking in emotional tones. Near the door, a SIGN on a stand: "REMAINING MEN TOGETHER." 
JACK (V.O.) This was a support group for men with testicular cancer.  The big moosie slobbering all over me was Bob. 
BOB We're still men. 
JACK Yes.  We're men.  Men is what we are. 
JACK (V.O.) Six months ago, Bob's testicles were removed.  Then hormone therapy.  He developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high and his body upped the estrogen.  That was where my head fit -- into his huge, sweating tits that hung enormous, the way we think of God's as big. 
BOB They're gonna have to open my pec's again to drain the fluid. 
Bob hugs tighter; then looks with empathy into Jack's eyes. 
BOB Okay.  You cry now. 
Jack looks at Bob. 
JACK (V.O.) Wait.  Back up.  Let me start earlier. 
INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Jack lies in bed, staring at the ceiling. 
JACK (V.O.) For six months.  I could not sleep. 
INT. COPY ROOM - DAY 
Jack, sleepy, stands over a copy machine.  His Starbucks cup sits on the lid, moving back and forth as the machine copies. 
JACK (V.O.) With insomnia, nothing is real. Everything is far away.  Everything is a copy of a copy of a copy. 
Other people make copies, all with Starbucks cups, sipping. Jack picks up his cup and his copies and leaves. 
INT. JACK'S OFFICE - SAME 
Jack, sipping, stares blankly at a Starbucks bag on the floor, full of newspapers and FAST FOOD GARBAGE. 
JACK (V.O.) When deep space exploration ramps up, it will be corporations that name everything.  The IBM Stellar Sphere. The Philip Morris Galaxy.  Planet Starbucks. 
Jack looks up as a pudgy man, Jack's BOSS, enters, Starbucks cup in hand, and slides a stack of reports on Jack's desk. 
BOSS I'm going to need you out-of-town a little more this week.  We've got some "red-flags" to cover. 
JACK (V.O.) It must've been Tuesday.  he was wearing his "cornflower-blue" tie. 
JACK (listless management speak) You want me to de-prioritize my current reports until you advise of a status upgrade? 
BOSS You need to make these your primary "action items." 
JACK (V.O.) He was full of pep.  Must've had his grande latte enema. 
BOSS Here are your flight coupons.  Call me from the road if there are any snags.  Your itinerary... 
Jack hides a yawn, pretends to listen. 
INT. BATHROOM - JACK'S CONDO - NIGHT 
Jack sits on the toilet, CORDLESS PHONE to his ear, flips through an IKEA catalog.  There's a stack of old Playboy magazines and other catalogs nearby. 
JACK (V.O.) Like everyone else, I had become a slave to the IKEA nesting instinct. 
JACK (into phone) Yes.  I'd like to order the Erika Pekkari slip covers. 
JACK (V.O.) I found freedom.  Losing all hope was freedom. 
Jack pulls away from Bob.  On Bob's chest, there's a WET MASK of Jack's face from how he looks weeping. 
JACK (V.O.) Babies don't sleep this well. 
INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Jack lies sound asleep. 
JACK (V.O.) I became addicted. 
INT. SMALL PROTESTANT CHURCH - NIGHT 
Jack moves into a "group hug" of sickly people, men and women.  In view is a sign by the door "Free and Clear." 
INT. OFFICE BUILDING BASEMENT - NIGHT 
Jack stands with a weeping middle-aged WOMAN.  He begins to cry along with her.  A sign by the door: "Onward and Upward." 
JACK (V.O.) If I didn't say anything, people assumed the worst.  They cried harder.  I cried harder. 
INT. PUBLIC BUILDING CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT 
Everyone, including Jack, sits back in their seats, EYES CLOSED.  The Leader speaks into a microphone. 
LEADER Tonight, we're going to open the green door -- the heart chakra... 
JACK (V.O.) I wasn't really dying, I wasn't host to cancer or parasites; I was the warm little center that the life of this world crowded around. 
LEADER ...And you open the door and you step inside.  We're inside our hearts.  Now, imaging your pain as a white ball of healing light.  That's right, the pain itself is a ball of healing light. 
Jack, eyes closed, is silent... 
LEADER It moves over your body, healing you. Keep this going and step forward, through the back door of the room. Where does it lead?  To your cave. Step forward into your cave. 
INT. CAVE - JACK'S IMAGINATION 
Jack walks along, moving through an ICE CAVERN... 
LEADER'S VOICE That's right.  You're going deeper into your cave.  And you're going to find your power animal... 
Jack comes upon a PENGUIN.  The penguin looks at him, cocks his head to signal Jack forward. 
PENGUIN Slide. 
The penguin jumps onto a patch of ICE and slides away. 
EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
Jack walks out a doorway, saying goodbye to people.  He walks down the sidewalk, shining with peace. 
JACK (V.O.) Every evening I died and every evening I was born again.  Resurrected. 
CUT BACK TO: 
INT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH MEETING ROOM - RESUMING 
Jack's still in an embrace with Bob. 
JACK (V.O.) Bob loved me because he thought my testicles were removed too.  Being there, my face against his tits, ready to cry -- this was my vacation. 
MARLA SINGER enters.  She has short matte black hair and big, dark eyes like a character from japanese animation. 
JACK (V.O.) And, she ruined everything. 
Marla looks around, raises a cigarette to her lips. 
MARLA This is cancer, right? 
Bob and Jack stare, dumbfounded. 
INT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH MEETING ROOM - LATER 
Everyone paired-off.  MOVE THROUGH ROOM... FIND JACK'S FACE as he stares... MOVE THROUGH ROOM... FIND MARLA'S FACE. She's drinking coffee, smoking a cigarette. 
JACK (V.O.) This ... chick ... Marla Singer ... did not have testicular cancer.  She was a liar. 
INT. SMALL PROTESTANT CHURCH - NIGHT 
Marla sits with the group, smoking, listening intently while a member speaks.  Jack spies on her. 
JACK (V.O.) She had no diseases at all.  I had seen her at my melanoma Monday night group ... 
INT. CATHOLIC CATHEDRAL - NIGHT 
Marla sits at the end of a row, smoking.  All the faces down the row are turned toward her, incredulous... 
JACK (V.O.) ... and at "Free and Clear," my blood parasites group Thursdays. 
Jack leans out further than the others, scornful. 
JACK (V.O.) -- And, again, at "Seize The Day," my tuberculosis Friday night. 
CUT BACK TO: 
INT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH MEETING ROOM - ANOTHER NIGHT 
Jack watches... Marla's eyes are closed, her head on the shoulder of the MAN she's embraced by.  She opens her eyes, catching Jack's stare.  Jack looks away. 
JACK (V.O.) Marla -- the big tourist.  Her lie reflected my lie. 
Marla rests her chin on the man's shoulder.  Tears roll down her cheeks.  She wipes at them. 
EXT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH - NIGHT 
Marla walks out,  The support group's dispersing.  Jack exits amongst them.  He spots Marla walking away. 
JACK (V.O.) And suddenly, I felt nothing.  I couldn't cry.  So, once again, I could not sleep. 
Jack stares after Marla for a long moment.  He walks away. 
INT. BEDROOM - LATER 
Jack, in underwear, is cross-legged on the floor, assembling IKEA furniture, CORDLESS PHONE shouldered to his ear. 
JACK (into phone) No, I just can't believe that card is declined -- Okay, okay, let me give you a different card number. 
Marla puts her head down on Jack's shoulder as if she were crying.  Jack pulls her head back up.  She deadpans at him. 
JACK Why are you doing this? 
MARLA It's cheaper than a movie, and there's free coffee. 
JACK These are my groups.  I was here first.  I've been coming for a year. 
MARLA A year?  How'd you manage that? 
JACK Anyone who might've noticed either died or recovered and never came back. 
LEADER Let yourself cry. 
MARLA Why do you do it? 
JACK I... I don't know.  I guess... when people think you're dying, they really listen, instead... 
MARLA -- Instead of just waiting for their turn to speak. 
JACK Yeah. 
Brief recognition between them, broken as the Leader passes. 
LEADER Quietly, now.  Share with each other. 
Jack waits till the Leader's out of earshot. 
JACK (warning) It becomes an addiction. 
MARLA Really? 
Jack sighs, then pulls back. 
JACK Look, I can't cry with a faker present. 
MARLA Candy-stripe a cancer ward.  It's not my problem. 
JACK Please.  Can't we do something... ? 
Marla starts out of the room.  Jack follows her. 
LEADER Now, the closing prayer. 
EXT. CHURCH - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 
Marla gets to the sidewalk, moving quickly along. 
JACK We'll split up the week.  You can have lymphoma, tuberculosis and -- 
MARLA You take tuberculosis.  My smoking doesn't go over at all. 
JACK I think testicular cancer should be no contest. 
MARLA Well, technically, I have more of a right to be there than you.  You still have your balls. 
JACK You're kidding. 
MARLA I don't know -- am I? 
Jack follow Marla into... 
INT. LAUNDROMAT - CONTINUOUS 
Marla walks with authority up to an unwatched DRYER.  She takes out clothes, picks out jeans, pants and shirts. 
MARLA I'll take the parasites. 
JACK You can't have both parasites.  You can take blood parasites -- 
MARLA I want brain parasites. 
JACK Okay.  I'll take blood parasites and organic brain dementia -- 
MARLA I want that. 
JACK You can't have the whole brain! 
MARLA So far, you have four and I only have two! 
JACK Then, take blood parasites.  It's yours.  Now we each have three. 
Marla gathers the chosen garments and heads out past Jack... 
EXT. SIDEWALK - CONTINUOUS 
Jack follows, bewildered. 
JACK You... left half your clothes. 
HONK!  Jack starts.  Marla's led him into the street with traffic barreling down. 
Marla walks on, oblivious as CARS screech to a halt, HORNS BLARING.  Jack dashes, following... 
INT. THRIFT STORE - CONTINUOUS 
Marla drops the pile of clothes on a counter.  An old CLERK sifts through the clothes, begins writing on a pad. 
JACK You're selling those? 
Marla steps down hard on Jack's foot.  He winces in pain. 
MARLA (for the Clerk to hear) Yes, I'm selling some chothes. 
The Clerk starts to ring up the assessed amounts. 
MARLA So, we each have three -- that's six. What about the seventh day?  I want ascending bowel cancer. 
JACK (V.O.) The girl had done her homework. 
JACK I want ascending bowel cancer. 
The Clerk gives a strange look as he hands money to Marla. 
MARLA That's your favorite, too?  Tried to slip it by me, eh? 
JACK We'll split it.  You get it the first and third Sunday of the month. 
A giant corrugated METAL DOOR opens. 
JACK (V.O.) On a long enough time line, the survival rate for everyone drops to zero. 
Two TECHNICIANS lead Jack to the BURNT-OUT SHELL of a WRECKED AUTOMOBILE.  Jack sets down his briefcase, opens it and starts to make notes on a CLIPBOARDED FORM. 
JACK (V.O.) I'm a recall coordinator.  My job is to apply the formula.  It's a story problem. 
TECHNICIAN #1 Here's where the infant went through the windshield.  Three points. 
JACK (V.O.) A new car built by my company leaves somewhere traveling at 60 miles per hour.  The rear differential locks up. 
TECHNICIAN #2 The teenager's braces around the backseat ashtray would make a good "anti-smoking" ad. 
JACK (V.O.) The car crashes and burns with everyone trapped inside.  Now: do we initiate a recall? 
TECHNICIAN #1 The father must've been huge.  See how the fat burnt into the driver's seat with his polyester shirt?  Very "modern art." 
JACK (V.O.) Take the number of vehicles in the field, (A), and multiply it by the probable rate of failure, (B), then multiply the result by the average out-of-court settlement, (C).  A times B times C equals X... 
CUT TO: 
INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - MOVING DOWN RUNWAY 
Jack is speaking to the BUSINESSWOMAN next to him. 
JACK If X is less than the cost of a recall, we don't do one. 
BUSISNESS WOMAN Are there a lot of these kinds of accidents? 
JACK Oh, you wouldn't believe. 
BUSINESS WOMAN ... Which... car company do you work for? 
JACK A major one. 
Turgid silence.  Jack turns to the window.  He sees a PELICAN get SUCKED into the TURBINE. 
JACK (V.O.) Every time the plane banked too sharply on take-off or landing, I prayed for a crash, or a mid-air collision -- anything. 
Jack's face remains bland during the following: the plane BUCKLES -- the cabin wobbles.  People panic.  Masks drop. 
JACK (V.O.) No more haircuts.  Nothing matters, not even bad breath. 
The side of the plane SHEARS OFF!  Screaming PASSENGERS are sucked out into the night air, flying past the quivering wind.  Magazines and other objects fly everywhere. 
JACK (V.O.) Life insurance pays off triple if you die on a business trip. 
Jack remains in his same position, same bland expression. 
DING! -- the seatbelt light goes OUT.  Jack SNAPS AWAKE. EVERYTHING IS NORMAL.  Some passengers get out of their seats.  From next to Jack, a VOICE we've heard before... 
VOICE There are three ways to make napalm. One, mix equal parts of gasoline and frozen orange juice... 
Jack turns to see TYLER.  Without turned to Jack, Tyler continues: 
TYLER Two, equal parts gasoline and diet cola.  Three, dissolve kitty-litter in gasoline until the mixture is thick. 
JACK Pardon me? 
Tyler turns to Jack. 
JACK (V.O.) This is how I met -- 
TYLER Tyler Durden. 
Tyler offers his hand.  Jack takes it. 
TYLER You know why they have oxygen masks on planes? 
JACK No, supply oxygen? 
TYLER Oxygen gets you high.  In a catastrophic emergency, we're taking giant, panicked breaths... 
Tyler grabs a safety instruction CARD from the seatback, hands it to Jack. 
TYLER Suddenly, we become euphoic and docile.  We accept our fate. 
Tyler points to passive faces on the drawn figures. 
TYLER Emergency water landing, 600 miles per hour.  Blank faces -- calm as Hindu cows. 
Jack laughs. 
JACK What do you do, Tyler? 
TYLER What do you want me to do? 
JACK I mean -- for a living. 
TYLER Why?  So you can say, "Oh, that's what you do." -- And be a smug little shit about it? 
Jack laughs.  Tyler reaches under the seat in front of him and lifts a BRIEFCASE. 
TYLER You have a kind of sick desperation in your laugh. 
Jack points to his own briefcase. 
JACK We have the same briefcase. 
Tyler turns the top of his briefcase toward Jack. 
TYLER Open it. 
Jack looks at Tyler, then pops the latches and raises the lid to reveal quaintly-wrapped bars of SOAP. 
TYLER Soap -- the yardstick of civilization. (reaches in his pocket) I make and sell soap... 
Tyler hands Jack his card.  "THE PAPER STREET SOAP COMPANY." 
TYLER If you were to add nitric acid to the soap-making process, one would get nitroglycerin.  With enough soap, one could blow up the world, if one were so inclined. 
Tyler SNAPS the briefcase shut.  Jack stares. 
JACK Tyler, you are by far the most interesting "single-serving" friend I've ever met. 
Tyler stares back.  Jack, enjoying his own chance to be witty, leans closer to Tyler. 
JACK (V.O.) The gas could have slowly filled the condo.  Seventeen-hundred square feet with high ceilings, for days and days. 
EXT. PAYPHONE - RESUMING 
Jack replaces the receiver.  He pockets Marla's number, digs out a small FILOFAX.  He flips through the pages for phone numbers and addresses.  Most of the pages are blank. 
DOORMAN Many young people feel trapped and desperate. 
INSERT - CLOSE ON THE BASE OF JACK'S REFRIGERATOR 
JACK (V.O.) Then, the refrigerator's compressor could have clicked on... 
Click.  KABOOM!  SCREEN GOES WHITE. 
EXT. PAYPHONE - RESUMING 
Jack looks at the Doorman.  Tyler's BUSINESS CARD falls from the Filofax.  Jack catches it. 
DOORMAN If you don't know what you want, you end up with a lot you don't. 
The Doorman walks away.  Jack stares at Tyler's card. 
JACK (V.O.) If you asked me now, I couldn't tell you why I called him. 
Jack re-deposits the quarter, dials Tyler's number.  It RINGS... and RINGS and RINGS.  Jack sighs and hangs up the phone.  A moment, then the phone RINGS. 
JACK Hello? 
TYLER'S VOICE Who's this? 
JACK Tyler? 
TYLER'S VOICE Who's this? 
JACK Uh... I'm sorry.  We met on the plane.  We had the same briefcase. I'm... you know, the clever guy. 
TYLER'S VOICE Oh, yeah. 
JACK I just called a second ago.  There was no answer.  I'm at a payphone. 
TYLER'S VOICE I star-sixty-nined you.  I never pick up my phone.  What's up? 
JACK Well... let me see... here's the thing... 
EXT. LOU'S TAVERN - NIGHT 
A small building in the middle of a concrete parking lot. 
INT. LOU'S TAVERN - SAME 
Jack and Tyler sit in the back, with a pitcher of BEER. 
JACK You buy furniture.  You tell yourself: this is the last sofa I'll ever need.  No matter what else happens, I've got the sofa issue handled.  Then, the right set of dishes.  The right dinette. 
TYLER This is how we fill up our lives. 
Tyler lights a cigarette. 
JACK I guess so. 
TYLER And, now it's gone. 
JACK All gone. 
Tyler offers cigarettes.  Jack declines. 
TYLER Could be worse.  A woman could cut off your penis while you're asleep and toss it out the window of a moving car. 
JACK There's always that. 
TYLER I don't know, maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe it's a terrible tragedy. 
JACK ...no ...no ... 
TYLER I mean, you did lose a lot of nice, neat little shit.  The trendy paper lamps, the Euro-trash shelving unit, am I right? 
Jack laughs, nods.  He shakes his head, drinks. 
TYLER But maybe, just maybe, you've been delivered. 
JACK (toasts) Delivered from Swedish furniture. 
TYLER Delivered from armchairs in obscure green stripe patterns. 
JACK Delivered from Martha Stewart. 
TYLER Delivered from bullshit colors like "Cobalt," "Ebony," and "Fuchsia." 
They laugh together.  Then, silence.  They drink. 
JACK Insurance'll cover it. 
TYLER Oh, yeah, you gotta start making the list. 
JACK What list? 
TYLER The "now I get to go out and buy the exact same stuff all over again" list.  That list. 
JACK I don't... think so. 
TYLER This time maybe get a widescreen TV. You'll be occupied for weeks. 
JACK Well, I have to file a claim... 
TYLER The things you own, they end up owning you. 
JACK Don't I? 
TYLER Do what you like. 
JACK (looks at watch) God, it's late.  I should find a hotel... 
TYLER A hotel? 
JACK Yeah. 
TYLER So, you called me up, because you just wanted to have a drink before you... go find a hotel? 
JACK This is crazy. 
TYLER Alright, go crazy.  Let 'er rip. 
JACK Where do you want it?  In the face? 
TYLER Surprise me. 
Jack swings a wide, clumsy roundhouse -- hits Tyler's neck -- makes a dull, flat sound. 
JACK Shit.  Sorry.  That didn't count. 
TYLER Like hell.  That counted. 
Tyler shoots out a straight punch to Jack's chest.  Jack falls back against a car.  His eyes tear up. 
TYLER How do you feel? 
JACK Strange. 
TYLER But a good strange. 
JACK Is it? 
TYLER We've crossed the threshold.  You want to call it off? 
JACK Call what off? 
TYLER The fight. 
JACK What fight? 
TYLER This fight, pussy. 
Jack swings another roundhouse that slams right under Tyler's ear.  Tyler punches Jack in the stomach.  Tyler and Jack move clumsily, throwing punches.  They breathe heavier, drooling saliva and blood, growing dizzier from every impact. 
EXT. CURBSIDE - LATER 
Jack and Tyler sit on the curb, watching sparse headlights on the nearby freeway.  Their eyes are glazed with endorphin- induced serenity.  They look at each other, laugh.  Look away. 
TYLER If you could fight anyone... one on one, whoever you wanted, who would you fight? 
JACK Anyone? 
TYLER Anyone. 
Jack thinks. 
JACK My boss, probably. (pause) Who would you fight? 
TYLER My dad.  No question. 
A long pause as Jack studies Tyler's face. 
JACK Oh, yeah. (nodding) I didn't know my dad.  Well, I knew him, till I was six.  He went and married another woman, had more kids. Every six years or so he'd do it again -- new city, new family. 
TYLER He was setting up franchises.  My father never went to college, so it was really important that I go. 
JACK I know that. 
TYLER After I graduated, I called him long distance and asked, "Now what?"  He said, "Get a job."  When I turned twenty-five, I called him and asked, "Now what?"  He said, "I don't know. Get married." 
JACK Same here. 
TYLER A generation of men raised by women. I'm wondering if another woman is the answer we really need. 
Another pause.  Jack feels his bleeding lip, smiles. 
JACK We should do this again sometime. 
Tyler cracks a smile, give a sidelong glance to Jack. 
EXT. PAPER STREET - NIGHT 
A street sign: "PAPER STREET."  A PAPER MILL stis on one side, facing a lone HOUSE on the other.  The rest of the land is grass and weeds.  It's a grand, old three-story, long abandoned.  Tyler leads Jack toward it. 
JACK Where's your car? 
TYLER What car? 
JACK (V.O.) I don't know how Tyler found the house, but he'd been there for half a year. 
INT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - ENTRANCE -- NIGHT 
Tyler leads Jack through the FRONT DOOR... 
JACK (V.O.) It looked like it was waiting to be torn down.  Most of the windows were boarded up. 
INT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENT LATER 
Tyler and Jack climb CREAKY STAIRS to the 2ND FLOOR LANDING. 
JACK (V.O.) None of the doors locked.  The stairs were ready to collapse.  I didn't know if he owned it or he was squatting. 
Tyler opens the door to a ROOM... 
INT. ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Jack enters, stis on the creaky BED.  Dust drifts upwards. 
JACK (V.O.) Neither would have surprised me. 
INT. SHOWER - MORNING 
Jack turns on the water.  LOUD VIBRATIONS from the walls. Water spits in starts. 
JACK (V.O.) Nothing worked.  The rusty plumbing leaked.  Turning on a light meant another light in the house went out. 
EXT. LOU'S TAVERN PARKING LOT - NIGHT 
All the tavern's lights are off.  Tyler and Jack FIGHT. FIVE GUYS stand around watching. 
INT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING 
Jack, his face showing NEW BRUISES AND CUTS, makes coffee with a wire-mesh strainer.  Tyler shuffles in, wearing a flannel bathrobe.  He spears pieces of bread on a fork, starts roasting them over a burner. 
JACK (V.O.) There were no neighbors.  Just warehouses and the paper mill.  The fart smell of steam, the hamster cage smell of wood chips. 
MARLA Do you want to wait to hear me describe death? 
Jack puts the handset on top of the phone, still off the hook, walks out the back door. 
MARLA'S VOICE Do you want to listen and see if my spirit can use the telephone? 
Thru the archway: Tyler leans to look in, curious. 
INT. BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT 
GRUNTS of PLEASURE and EXERTION.  Glimpses of TORSOS, ASSES, LEGS, ARMS, BREASTS, and FEMALE HAIR, all DRENCHED in SWEAT. Sheets RIP.  Bodies hit the FLOOR.  Insane GRUNTING and LAUGHING.  A flash of MARLA'S FACE. 
CUT TO: 
INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - SUNRISE 
Jack sits up in bed, looks around the room. 
INT. 2ND FLOOR LANDING 
Jack steps out of his room.  The neighboring door is closed. 
JACK (V.O.) Tyler's door was closed.  I'd been living here two months, and Tyler's door was never closed. 
INT. BATHROOM - SAME 
Jack stares into the TOILER, looking at SIX USED CONDOMS. 
INT. KITCHEN - MORNING 
Jack sits at the table, sips coffee, read Reader's Digest. He hears FOOTSTEPS approaching. 
JACK You're not going to believe what I dreamt last night. 
Marla walks in, straightening her dress, looks like she's been raped by a hurricane.  Jack's jaw drops. 
MARLA I can hardly believe anything about last night. 
Marla goes to pour coffee.  She takes a swig, GARGLES and SPITS it in the sink.  She gives Jack a lascivious smile. 
JACK What are you doing here? 
MARLA What... ? 
JACK What the hell are you doing here? 
Marla stares at him a beat, then drops the cup in the sink. 
MARLA Fuck you. 
Marla shoves open the door to the backyard and walks out. Jack gets up, watches her stomp away. 
Jack turns and -- Tyler is at his shoulder, staring after Marla.  He's in his usual sweatpants.  He grins at Jack, then moves away, pours himself coffee.  Jack, smoldering, slumps at the table and picks up Reader's Digest.  Tyler puts his foot on a countertop, does stretching exercises. 
TYLER She's a piece of work.  Get this -- I come in here last night, the phone's off the hook... 
Jack pretends to read, quickly glances at Tyler.  TYLER'S VOICE FADES... 
JACK (V.O.) I already knew the story before he told it to me. 
INT. KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON (FLASHBACK) 
Tyler enters, gently lifts the handset and listens. 
MARLA'S VOICE (from handset) I'll tell you when I'm floating out of my body. 
Tyler smiles. 
JACK (V.O.) How could Tyler, off all people, think it was a bad thing that Marla Singer was about to die? 
INT. MARLA'S - 8TH FLOOR LANDING - LATE AFTERNOON (FLASHBACK) 
Tyler, a wry smile on his face, ambles up the stiars, looking at the rotting walls.  He reaches the top of the stairs and heads for Marla's room.  Before he can knock, Marla's hand shoots out and grabs him... 
INT. MARLA'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS (FLASHBACK) 
Marla pulls Tyler inside and shuts the door.  Her drugged eyes look him over. 
MARLA You got here fast. 
She staggers and sits on the bed.  She slides off, along with the blanket and sheets, to the floor. 
MARLA The mattresses are all sealed in slippery plastic. 
She tries to focus her eyes on Tyler. 
MARLA Did I call you? 
Tyler studies her with cynical curiosity, looks at a DILDO lying atop a dresser.  Marla follows his gaze. 
MARLA Don't worry.  It's not a threat to you. 
SIRENS and vehicles SCREECHING outside can be HEARD; doors opening and SLAMMING; running FOOTFALLS. 
MARLA Oh, no!  Somebody called the cops... 
She gets to her feet, grabs Tyler, pulls him out the door. 
INT. HALLWAY (FLASHBACK) 
Marla LOCKS her door, then pulls Tyler toward the STAIRCASE. COPS and PARAMEDICS charge up with oxygen and medical kits. Marla and Tyler flatten against the wall to let them pass. 
COP 8-G!  Where's 8-G? 
MARLA (pointing) End of the hall. 
The rescuers keep running. 
MARLA (calling after) The girl who lives there used to be a charming, lovely girl, but she's lost faith in herself... 
COP Miss Singer, let us help you!  You have every reason to live! 
Marla yanks Tyler's arm, heading down the stairs. 
MARLA She's a monster!  Infectious human waste!  Good luck trying to save her! 
INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT (FLASHBACK) 
Tyler scratches his head, wears a RUBBER GLOVE. 
TYLER You want to finish her off? 
JACK Uh... nah... 
Jack continues toward his room. 
INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT 
Jack brushes his teeth. 
JACK (V.O.) I became the calm, little center of the world.  I was the Zen master. 
CLOSE UP - COMPUTER MONITOR 
Haiku is BEING TYPED in a trendy, italicized font. 
"Worker bees can leave Even drones can fly away The queen is their slave" 
JACK (V.O.) I wrote little haiku poems. 
INT. JACK'S OFFICE - DAY 
Jack's clothes are PERMANENTLY STAINED with BLOOD.  He sits in Zen pose, cigarette in mouth, finishes typing Haiku. 
JACK (V.O.) I faxed them around to everyone. 
He hits "SEND," gets the "ERROR CHIME" SOUND.  He presses this key over and over.  Boss enters. 
BOSS Is that your blood? 
JACK Some of it, yes. 
Boss stares at Jack like he's from Mars. 
BOSS Take the rest of the day off.  Come back tomorrow with clean clothes. Get yourself together. 
INT. HALLWAY - SAME 
Jack's leaving, looks like a war casualty, passing COWORKERS who coldly stare at him.  His face is totally passive. 
JACK (V.O.) I got right in everyone's hostile little face.  Yes, these are bruises from fighting.  I'm comfortable with them.  I am enlightened. 
EXT. PAPER STREET - SUNSET 
Jack walks toward the HOUSE. 
JACK (V.O.) You give up the condo life, give up all your flaming worldly possessions, go live in a dilapidated house in the toxic waste part of town... 
INT. TYLER'S KITCHEN - SUNSET 
Jack walks in.  SOUNDS of VIOLENT SEX and a POLAROID CAMERA from upstairs.  Pieces of PLASTER fall from the ceiling. 
JACK (V.O.) ... and you come home to this. 
TYLER'S VOICE (laughing) You fucking slut!! 
MARLA'S VOICE Thank you, sir, may I have another! Thank you sir, may I have another... ! 
Jack rolls his eyes, takes off his pants.  He runs water in the sink, finds a tiny bit of SOAP and scrubs at the blood stains.  The PHONE RINGS.  He answers it. 
JACK Yeah.  Speaking. 
INTERCUT WITH... 
INT. POLICE STATION - OFFICE 
A cop, DETECTIVE STERN, refers to a file. 
DETECTIVE STERN This is Detective Stern with the arson unit.  We have some new information about the "incident" at your condo. 
JACK Yes? 
DETECTIVE STERN I don't know if you're aware... your front door -- it seems someone sprayed freon into the lock, then tapped it with a chisel to shatter the cylinder. 
JACK No, I wasn't aware... 
JACK (V.O.) I am Jack's Cold Sweat. 
DETECTIVE STERN Does this sound strange to you? 
JACK Yes, sire, strange.  Very strange. 
Jack starts to sweat, scrubs his pants obsessively. 
DETECTIVE STERN The dynamite... 
JACK Dynamite? 
DETECTIVE STERN Yes.  It left a residue of ammonium oxalate and potassium perchloride. Do you know what that means? 
JACK What does that mean? 
DETECTIVE STERN It means it was homemade. 
JACK This is... really a shock... 
DETECTIVE STERN Whoever set this homemade dynamite could've blown out the pilot light days before the explosion.  The gas, it seems, was just a detonator. 
JACK Who do you think could've done this? 
DETECTIVE STERN I'll ask the questions, son. 
TYLER (whispering in Jack's ear) Tell him... 
Jack almost leaps out his skin, startled; looks to see Tyler standing right next to him. 
JACK Huh? 
TYLER (overlap w/below) "The liberator who destroyed my property has re-aligned my paradigm of perception." 
JACK Shhhhhh! (into phone, overlap w/above) I don't know what to make of this, sir, I really don't... 
DETECTIVE STERN Do you know anyone who'd have the expertise or motive to do something like this? 
TYLER "I reject the basic assumptions of civilization, including material possession." 
MARLA Yeah, we're done.  See you around. 
EXT. HOTEL - MOMENTS LATER 
Jack emerges from the lobby.  He looks up at Marla's window, watches her silhouette.  He walks away, right into -- Big BOB, the moose, eating a donut and drinking orange juice. 
BOB Cornelius!  How are you? 
JACK Bob.  I'm okay.  How are you? 
BOB Better than I've ever been in my life. 
JACK Really?  Great.  Still "Remaining Men Together?" 
An intense look of born-again fervor comes over Bob's face. 
BOB No.  I found something new. 
JACK Really, what's that? 
BOB (quietly) The first rule is... you aren't supposed to talk about it... 
JACK Oh. 
BOB And the second rule about it is... you're not supposed to talk about it. And the third rule... 
JACK Bob, Bob... I'm a member. 
BOB You are?! 
JACK Look at my face. 
Bob roughly slaps Jack's shoulder. 
BOB That's a fucking great, man!  Fucking great! Congratulations. 
JACK Yeah, both of us. 
BOB You know about the guy who invented it? I hear all kinds of things. Supposedly, he was born in a mental institution.  They say he only sleeps one hour a night.  You know about this guy?  Tyler Durden? 
INT. BASEMENT - ELECTRONICS WKREHOUSE - NIGHT 
The CROWD SCREAMS insanely as Bob and Jack go at it in the circle of light.  Bob's eyes are wild with glee. 
EXT. BASEMENT DOOR - ELECTRONICS WAREHOUSE - LATER 
Everyone sneaks out of this new location - we've seen none of these guys before - it's a new chapter.  Jack and Bob Stagger out last, Jack being in worse shape.  They both grin with religious serenity.  Bob hugs Jack. 
BOB Thank you.  Thank you. 
Bob relaxes the hug and Jack drops to the ground like a sack, completely enervated from the beating he took. 
JACK You're welcome. 
JACK (V.O.) Fight club -- this was mine and Tyler's gift... our gift to the world. 
INT. KITCHEN -- MORNING 
Jack has his briefcase on the table, looks at PAPERWORK. Tyler wanders in, carries a dirty pot to the sink.  Jack takes out a cigarette, lights up.  He offers the pack... 
TYLER No thanks, I quit. 
JACK You quit? 
TYLER Yeah.  Where you headed? 
JACK Work.  Going to work. 
Tyler scratches his chin absently. 
JACK What... ? 
TYLER Nothing.  Do what you like. 
Tyler walks out the way he came. 
INT. JACK'S OFFICE - DAY 
Jack sits staring at his SCREEN SAVER. 
INT. BOSS'S OFFICE - DAY 
Jack steps into the open doorway, knocks on the doorframe. Boss looks up from his large, expensive desk. 
JACK We need to talk. 
BOSS Okay.  Where to begin?  With your constant absenteeism?  With your unpresentable appearance?  You're up for review... 
JACK I Am Jack's Complete Lack of Surprise. 
Boss sits up in his seat, becoming enraged. 
JACK Let's pretend.  You're the Department of Transportation, and you discover that our company intentionally did nothing about leather seats cured in third world countries with chemicals we know cause birth defects?  Brake linings that fail after a thousand miles.  Fuel injectors that burn people alive. 
BOSS Just who the fuck do you think you are?!  Get out!  You're fired! 
JACK What about this?  Keep me on payroll as an outside consultant.  In exchange for my salary, I'll keep my mouth shut.  I won't need to come to the office.  I can do this job from home. 
Boss stands, moves around his desk, glaring with rage. 
BOSS You little fucker!  I oughta... 
Jack PUNCHES HIMSELF in the nose.  Blood starts to trickle. He punches himself in the jaw, throws himself back as if by the force of the punch, SLAMS against a framed picture and SHATTERS the glass.  He falls to the floor. 
JACK (V.O.) I Am Jack's Smirking Revenge. 
Jack gets back to his feet. 
JACK Please... don't hit me again, please. I'm your responsibility... 
He PUNCHES himself in the stomach, then in the jaw again. He reels backwards, pulls down a hanging shelf, its contents flying.  He hits the floor. 
JACK (V.O.) For some reason, I thought of my first fight -- with Tyler. 
Jack crawls toward Boss, dripping blood, grabs Boss's leg. 
JACK Please... give me the paychecks like I asked for.  I won't be any trouble. You won't see me again. 
TYLER Yes, I am shit and crazy, to you and this whole fucking world... 
Tyler's blood spatters on Lou.  Lou tries to shake Tyler off, but Tyler BITES Lou's NECKTIE.  The Thug grabs Tyler and pulls, the necktie tightening and strangling Lou.  Lou slaps at Tyler's face, but recoils from the blood.  Tyler spits and shouts through clenched teeth... 
TYLER You don't know where I've been. 
Tyler bear hugs Lou, pulls him to the floor.  Tyler rubs his bloody face into Lou's face.  The Thug lifts Tyler.  Tyler clings to Lou's belt, dragging Lou as he is dragged... 
TYLER We need this place.  We need it. Please let us keep it, please... 
Blood dribbles out of Tyler's mouth, spattering Lou. 
LOU What are you doing?! 
TYLER Pleeeeeease! 
LOU Okay!  Okay, fuck it!  Use the basement!  Get off me! 
TYLER We need some towels, Lou.  We need replacement light bulbs. 
LOU Alright, Christ!  Fucking let me go! 
TYLER Thank you.  Thank you, sir... 
LOU Let go of me!! 
Tyler lets go of Lou's belt.  Lou scrambles away.  The Thug drops Tyler, trying to keep clear of the blood.  Lou gets to his feet, looks at Tyler, then at the rest of the guys.  He and the Thug back away... slamming the door behind. 
Fight club surrounds Tyler.  They help him up, move him to a crate.  Tyler sits slumped for a long moment, his breathing labored... then, he sits back, crossing his legs and looking to the group, his demeanor businesslike. 
TYLER This week, each of you has a homework assignment.  You're going to go out and start a fight with a total stranger... (pause, drooling blood) You're going to start a fight... and you're going to lose. 
Jack beams in appreciation. 
EXT. STREET - DAY 
Ricky trips a passing YUPPIE.  The Yuppie falls. 
JACK (V.O.) Not as easy as it sounds.  People'll do just about anything to avoid a fight. 
The Yuppies gets up, angry, and Ricky PUNCHES him... 
YUPPIE Hey!  Wha... What the hell... what are you doing?!  Who are you?!! 
The Yuppie backs away.  Ricky follows... 
YUPPIE Get away from me!  Keep away! NO... ! 
Ricky TACKLES the Yuppie.  The Yuppie struggles spastically. 
YUPPIE Who are you!?  Why are you attacking me... ?! 
Having no recourse, the Yuppie begins trading blows. 
EXT. AUTO SHOP - DAY 
A MECHANIC WITH A BATTERED FACE uses a hose to wash the sidewalk.  As MEN pass, he jerks the hose up and SPRAYS them. 
FIRST MAN Hey... hey... 
SECOND MAN Watch out, jackass! 
These men continue on their way. 
The Mechanic sprays a third man, a SEMINARY STUDENT, who looks down, stunned. 
SEMINARIAN You... you did that on purpose! 
The Mechanic DOUSES the Seminarian.  The Seminarian grabs the hose, wrestling the Mechanic for it.  The Mechanic shoves the Seminarian, who responds with a half-assed PUNCH. The Mechanic purposely takes it.  The Seminarian starts to run away.  The Mechanic sprints after him, PUNCHING the Seminarian in the back of the neck.  They fight. 
INT. RECORD STORE STOCKROOM - NIGHT 
A FIST smashes a JAW.  Guys CHEER.  An arm snakes around a neck and squeezes, blood and sweat dripping.  It's the YUPPIE and the SEMINARIAN fighting.  Tyler walks around the perimeter of the circle. 
JACK (V.O.) Now nobody was the center of fight club except the two men fighting. The leader walked around in the crowd, out in the darkness. 
Tyler hands ENVELOPES out to the crowd. 
JACK (V.O.) Everyone took a homework assignment. 
EXT. STREET - LATE NIGHT 
Ricky and another FIGHT CLUBBER paste up a BILLBOARD which reads: "DID YOU KNOW? YOU CAN USE YOUR OLD MOTOR OIL TO FERTILIZE YOUR LAWN! -- ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY." 
INT. PAPER STREET HOUSE 
HANDS use a MARKER, writing on a FILE: "Disinformation." 
EXT. LARGE PARKING LOT - DAY 
Jack and Tyler, in work gloves, armed with TOOLS, work together to lift the entire METAL PLATE of EXIT SPIKES from the ground.  They reverse it, then replace it. 
MOMENTS LATER 
Jack and Tyler walk away, each carrying a 4x4 plank of WOOD. 
JACK There's fight club in Delaware City. 
TYLER I heard.  Local 15, Monday nights. 
As they pass PARKED CARS, they SWING the planks against front bumpers -- activating ALARMS and INFLATING AIR BAGS... 
JACK Local 8 just started in Penns Grove. And, Bob said he was at fight club in Newcastle last week. 
TYLER Newcastle?  Did you start that one? 
JACK I thought you did. 
In the background, a CAR quickly EXITS the parking lot -- front tires EXPLODING, wheel rims throwing sparks. 
INT. FAMILY HOUSEHOLD -- NIGHT 
FATHER, MOTHER, YOUNG DAUGHTER and SON, eat dinner, watching TELEVISION.  Suddenly, the TV IMAGE turns to SNOW and static. 
Family members stop eating.  Father picks up the REMOTE, points it -- all channels are SNOW. 
Father turns the TV OFF.  He and his family members look at each other, utensils in hand, uncomfortable. 
Tyler shoves Raymond's wallet back into Raymond's pocket. 
TYLER Would you rather be dead? 
RAYMOND No, please, no, God, no! 
Tyler moves the gun right between Raymond's eyes. 
RAYMOND NOOOOO! 
Tyler UNCOCKS the gun, lowers it. 
TYLER I'm keeping your license.  I know where you live.  I'm going to check on you.  If you aren't back in school and on your way to being a veterinarian in six weeks, you will be dead.  Get the hell out of here. 
Raymond staggers to his feet, heads down an alleyway.  Jack and Tyler watch Raymond flee, then Tyler looks at Jack. 
JACK I feel sick. 
TYLER Imagine how he feels. 
Tyler brings the gun to his own head, pulls the trigger -- CLICK.  Empty. 
JACK I don't care, that was horrible. 
Tyler walks away. 
TYLER Tomorrow will be the most beautiful day of Raymond K. Hessell's life. 
Jack watches Tyler go. 
TYLER His breakfast will taste better than any meal he has ever eaten. 
Jack turns to look the direction Raymond ran.  He finally turns back, following after Tyler. 
INT. BUSINESS OFFICE - NIGHT 
SLOW MOTION: in the deserted office, gasoline filled COMPUTER MONITORS begin to EXPLODE...BOOM...BOOM...BOOM... ! 
EXT. CITY STREETS -- MORNING 
Luxury AUTOMOBILES are parked, splattered with BIRD SHIT. 
EXT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAWN 
VIEWED OUT 3RD STORY WINDOW: Tyler uses a RAKE, dragging it across rocks and dirt.  He stops a moment, rake on his shoulder, staring off.  Then, back to work... 
TYLER (muttering quietly) ... You are not how much money you have in the bank.  You are not the shoes you wear. 
Tyler's marking a large SQUARE in the weeds and rubble of the backyard, kicking rocks away, dragging the rake... 
TYLER You are not the contents of your wallet... 
INT. CITY BUS - NIGHT 
The DRIVER has a broken nose.  The bus is empty, except for Jack, in the very last seat, sleepy. 
JACK (V.O.) He had a plan.  Maybe you just didn't see it till it hit you between the eyes. (pause) But, it started to make sense... in a Tyler sort of way.  No fear.  No distractions.  The ability to let that which does not matter truly slide. 
EXT. PAPER STREET - NIGHT 
Jack gets off the bus.  As the bus pulls away, we see it dropped Jack off right in front of the house. 
INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER 
Jack enters.  Tyler, dressed in FATIGUES and splattered with PAINT, grabs BEERS from the refrigerator. 
JACK Hey. 
TYLER Hey. 
Jack notices ROPE and RAPPELLING TOOLS on the table.  Tyler comes to hand Jack a bunch of beers, nod to the living room. 
TYLER Go on in.  We're celebrating. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Jack, bewildered, enters carrying beers.  Tyler does NOT follow.  BOB, RICKY and several other fight club guys sit in front at the TV, chanting not too loudly, all also dressed in FATIGUES and splattered with PAINT. 
RICKY You are not your job. 
OTHERS TOGETHER You are not your job. 
RICKY You are not how much money you have in the bank. 
BOB Shhhh, wait... they're back to it... 
Bob goes to turn up the TV.  One guy, sixteen years old with an angelic face, ANGEL FACE, gets up to take beer from Jack. 
ANGEL FACE (to Jack) Great, thanks. 
Angel face starts distributing beer amongst his cohorts. 
BOB Shhhhh!  Watch! 
Jack looks to the TV -- it shows a LIVE shot of the "PARKER MORRIS BUILDING."  The building has a GIANT, GRINNING FACE PAINTED on it -- two BROKEN WINDOWS for EYES, with flames pouring out... FIRETRUCKS spray water. 
REPORTER (V.O.) Police Commissioner Jacobs has just arrived... just a second... excuse me, Commissioner, could you tell us what you think has happened? 
COMMISSIONER JACOBS, a wrinkled official, turns to camera. 
COMMISSIONER JACOBS (V.O.) We believe this is related to the recent acts of vandalism around the city.  It's some kind of organized group, and we are coordinating a rigorous investigation. 
Jack turns, sees Tyler in the archway, watching him.  Tyler tips his beer to toast, pulls back, out of sight. 
JACK What did you guys do? 
They all BURST INTO LAUGHTER.  They look at Jack and shake their heads.  Jack doesn't get it.  Suddenly, the guys' faces turn to stone.  Bob sits rigid. 
BOB The first rule of Project Mayhem is... you do not ask questions. 
Jack stares at them. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - NIGHT 
A luxurious BANQUET.  Commissioner Jacobs guzzles champagne. He rises and starts out of the room.  Jack, in a WAITER'S UNIFORM, looks apprehensively to OTHER WAITERS: BOB... RICKY... ANGEL FACE -- who all give each other a look. 
JACK What the hell ... ?! 
TYLER You choose your level of involvement. I won't make decisions for you. 
JACK I'm not asking you to. 
TYLER You're asking questions that don't have answers.  You know just as much about Project Mayhem as anybody else. 
JACK I don't think that's true. 
Tyler again steers into the oncoming lane, speeding up. Through the windshield: oncoming headlights -- a TRUCK. 
JACK Tyler... what is this... ! 
Jack fights	to turn the wheel, but Tyler uses both hands. 
TYLER What will you wish you'd done before you died? 
RICKY Paint a self-portrait. 
MECHANIC Build a house. 
TYLER (to Jack) And you? 
JACK I don't know!  Nothing! 
TYLER If you died right now, how would you feel about your life? 
JACK I would feel nothing about my life? Is that what you want to hear?! 
The oncoming truck HONKS and FLASHES its LIGHTS.  It moves to the other side of the road.  Tyler steers there, too. 
TYLER I want to hear the truth. 
JACK Fuck my life.  Fuck fight club.  Fuck you and fuck Marla.  I'm sick of this.  How's that? 
TYLER Why do you think I blew up your condo? 
JACK What? 
TYLER Hitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat!  It's not a seminar!  You have to forget everything you know, everything you think you know -- about life, about friendship, about you and me. 
Nearing impact with the oncoming truck, Tyler takes his hands off the wheel -- Jack keeps his grip, turns the wheel... the car swerves... 
The truck ROARS past, spraying water, HORN BLASTING. 
Tyler looks at Jack, his hands in the air.  Jack looks at Tyler with dead eyes. 
JACK Okay, okay... fine... 
Jack takes his hands off the wheel, holds them in the air. Tyler studies Jack face, impressed.  Tyler makes no move to take the wheel. 
THROUGH THR WINDSHIELD: a STALLED CAR ahead on the side of the road, surrounded by flares. 
Jack and Tyler's eyes stay locked as the car drifts onto the shoulder... heading for the stalled car.  Their faces are illuminated by the light of the flares.  Tyler smiles. 
They SMASH into the stalled car -- AIRBAGS INFLATE!  The back of their car whips around and carries it into a ass- over-tea-kettle ROLL down a hill... 
JACK (V.O.) I'd never been in a car accident. This must've been what all those statistics felt like before I filed them into my reports. 
The car finally hits the bottom, lying on its roof. 
EXT. OVERTURNED CAR 
Tyler crawls from the passenger side.  He walks around... opens the driver's side door and drags Jack out into the mud.  Ricky and the Mechanic climb out the broken rear window.  Tyler sits beside the stunned, wounded Jack. 
TYLER We just had a near-life experience. 
INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT 
Jack lies in bed, traumatized, eyes empty, staring at the ceiling.  Tyler sits in a nearby chair. 
TYLER In the world I see -- you're stalking elk through the damp canyon forests around the ruins of Rockefeller Center.  You will wear leather clothes that last you the rest of your life.  You will climb the wrist- thick kudzu vines that wrap the Sears Tower.  You will see tiny figures pounding corn and laying-strips of venison on the empty car pool lane of the ruins of a superhighway. 
Tyler stands, gives Jack's head a pat. 
TYLER (leaving) Feel better, champ. 
INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER 
Jack sits at the table, sips coffee.  He's pale, dazed, seems broken.  He hears the faint SOUND of SAWING and HAMMERING, unsure of where it's coming from. 
Marla walks into the kitchen and goes straight to the counter.  Her back is to Jack as he looks at her.  She pours ccffee and lights a cigarette.  A beat of silence, then: 
MARLA I'll be out of your way in a sec. 
She seems to be as weak as Jack. 
JACK You... don't have to... leave. 
MARLA Whatever. 
JACK Really... I mean it. (pause) Have you been going to your groups? 
MARLA Chloe's dead. 
JACK When? 
MARLA Do you care? 
JACK I don't know. 
MARLA It was the smart move on her part. 
Marla turns to face Jack, a grim expression on her face. There's a BRUISE on her ARM.  Jack gets up, moves closer. 
JACK Why are we both... caught up like this... with... ? 
JACK (V.O.) I came so close to saying Tyler's name, I could feel it vibrate inside my mouth. 
Marla looks a him, waiting. 
JACK I don't understand.  Why does a weak person have to go out and find a strong person... to hang onto? 
MARLA What do you get out of it? 
Faint SOUND of SAWING and HAMMERING.  Jack can't quite figure where it's coming from. 
JACK Robert Paulson is dead.  He's dead, because of you... 
MECHANIC I understand. 
Everyone just stares at Jack. 
MECHANIC In death, a member of Project Mayhem has a name. 
JACK No -- ! 
MECHANIC His name is Robert Paulson. 
RICKY His name is Robert Paulson! 
JACK No! 
ALL SPACE MONKEYS His name is Robert Paulson! 
JACK Stop that -- ! 
ALL SPACE MONKEYS (louder) His name is Robert Paulson!  His name is Robert Paulson... 
Jack backs away, surrounded, PUSHES his way out of the room. 
INT. TYLER'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Jack barges in, goes to the desk, rifling through drawers. He finds FLIGHT COUPONS, used and unused.  The used coupons. have the flight information, including the destination cities.  The PHONE RINGS.  Jack answers it... 
JACK Tyler? 
DETECTIVE STERN'S VOICE (from phone) This is Detective Stern of the arson unit.  I'd like to see you in my office tomorrow morning... 
Jack, in a panic, HANGS UP.

INT. BAR - NIGHT 
Jack enters.  He sees several MALE PATRONS with FIGHT BRUISES.  Jack moves to the bar.  The BARTENDER has a broken arm and swollen face.

The PROPRIETOR, his head bandaged, is confronted by Jack. 
JACK I need to know where Tyler is.  Can't you help me? 
BANDAGED PROPRIETOR Sir, you're disturbing the other patrons with your laudish behavior. 
JACK (pointing) There's no one else here. 
BANDAGED PROPRIETOR I'm sorry, I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about. 
JACK Look at my face.  I'm a member.  I just need to know if you've seen Tyler Durden. 
BANDAGED PROPRIETOR I'm not disclosed to bespeak any such information to you, nor would I, even if I had said information you want, at this juncture be able. 
Jack looks around, incredibly frustrated. 
JACK You are a moron. 
BANDAGED PROPRIETOR I'm afraid I have to insist you leave. 
Jack gives up, shoves his way out the door. 
INT. CITY BUS - DAY 
Jack sits on the bus, looking out the window.  The bus stops. 
JACK Say my name. 
MARLA What... ? 
JACK Say my name!  What's my name!? 
MARLA Tyler Durden!  Tyler Durden, you fucking freak.  What's going on?  I'm coming over there... 
JACK Marla, no, wait... 
As Marla HANGS UP.  Jack stares at the receiver, dazed... 
TYLER'S VOICE We've got six fight clubs in Chicago now... 
Jack spins, dropping the phone -- TYLER sits beside him. 
TYLER Four in Milwaukee. 
JACK What's this all about, Tyler? 
TYLER And, we're definitely filling a void in the rural South. 
JACK Why do people think I'm you? 
TYLER You broke your promise.  You talked to her about me. 
JACK Why do people think I'm Tyler Durden? 
TYLER Why did you do that? 
JACK Answer me, Tyler. 
TYLER Why do people think anything? 
JACK I don't know!  Tell me! 
Tyler shakes his head in disgust, extremely irritated. 
TYLER People think that you're me, because you and I happen to share the same body. 
JACK What... ? 
TYLER Is this really news to you? 
JACK What are you talking about... ? 
TYLER Sometimes I control it, and you imagine yourself watching me...

INT. HOTEL ROOM - RESUMING 
TYLER I go places without you.  Get things done... 
FLASHBACK - BUILDING - NIGHT 
The Parker Morris Building. 
JACK, Bob, Ricky, Angel Face and another GUY rappel down the side, SPRAYING PAINT.  JACK is "TYLER" in demeanor, mannerisms, speech... 
JACK (shouting) You are not your job.  You are not how much money you have in the bank. 
TWO WINDOWS SHATTER OUTWARD -- TWO MEN look out and yell: 
BRUISED MAN #1 I am not my job! 
BRUISED MAN #2 I am not how much money I have in the bank! 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - RESUMING 
Jack's having trouble catching his breath.  Tyler stands. 
TYLER There!  Happy?  I asked for one thing from you... one simple promise.  Now look what you've done! 
JACK This isn't possible... 
TYLER We're going to have to do something about Marla... 
VOICE You told me you'd say that, too. 
JACK Did I tell you I'd call you a fascist dickhead?! 
VOICE Well, sir, you said you might. 
Jack HANGS UP, desperately dials the next number on the bill. 
DIFFERENT VOICE (front phone) Twenty-one-sixty.  Maintenance. 
Jack sees a file: "2160 PICO BOULEVARD."  He throws the phone, pocketing the bill.  He grabs up all the FILES. 
EXT. MARLA'S HOTEL - SUNSET 
Jack's TAXI halts.  Marla walks out of the lobby doors, sees Jack getting out of the cab, laden with files... 
JACK Marla! 
Marla makes a sharp turn, walking away.  Jack follows, hugging the files to his chest, catching up. 
JACK Marla... 
MARLA Your whacked-out, bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom.  I thought they were going to break my arm. 
JACK I'm sorry, I... 
MARLA The were burning their fingertips with lye.  The stink was unbelievable. 
JACK Marla... I need to talk to you.  It's going to take a tremendous act of faith on your part for you to hear me out. 
MARLA Here comes an avalanche of bullshit. 
Marla heads into a DINER.  Jack follows... 
JACK -- A little more faith than that. 
INT. DINER - MOMENTS LATER 
Marla sits in a BOOTH.  Jack sits across from her. 
MARLA I don't want to hear anything you've got to say. 
JACK Give me a minute, Marla, alright... just sixty seconds. 
MARLA Sixty seconds, then I'm out of here. 
JACK Absolutely, you have every right.  I need you to do me a favor. 
MARLA I've done you enough favors. 
A WAITER with a BLACK EYE appears at the table. 
WAITER Sir!  Anything you order is free of charge, sir. 
MARLA Why is it free of charge? 
JACK Because... I'm Tyler Durden. 
MARLA Then, I'll have the clam chowder... fried chicken and a baked potato with everything and a chocolate chiffon pie. 
Jack look to the pass-through WINDOW into the kitchen where THREE COOKS look out with STITCHES in their faces. 
JACK Clean food, please. 
WAITER In that case, sir, may I advise against the lady eating the clam chowder? 
JACK Thanks, no clam chowder.  That's it. 
The waiter snaps to attention and leaves. 
MARLA You got about thirty seconds. 
JACK (takes a deep breath) I know that I've been... unwell.  I know it's been like there's two sides to me. 
MARLA Two sides?  You're Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Jackass. 
JACK I deserve that.  Anyway, I've... I've only just realized 
MARLA What? 
JACK I mean, the depth and breadth of our relationship has only recently been illuminated for me.  I know this... I know us hasn't been such a great thing for you... 
MARLA Whatever. (to waiter) I'll take my food to go... 
Marla's getting up to go, but Jack rises, fed up, takes her by the arm, putting her back in her seat. 
JACK Sit down!  Sit down and give me my last fifteen seconds without opening your mouth! 
Marla crosses her arms.  Jack collects himself. 
JACK I'm trying to tell you -- and this is where you have to trust me -- but, I think your life might be in real danger. 
MARLA What? 
JACK You have to get out of here.  Leave as soon as possible.  Go to any rural town, away from any major city... 
MARLA You are an insane person. 
JACK Marla... 
MARLA No, no, shut up!  I've had enough. I tried, Tyler... I have tried... 
Marla's getting upset, tears coming to her eyes. 
MARLA There's a part of you I really like, but I can't do this anymore.  I just can't.  This is killing me... 
JACK I'm sorry, but I... 
MARLA What?!  You're sorry?  I don't believe that for a minute. 
Marla gets up.  Jack grabs for her, but she's gone, heading for the door.  Jack gathers his files, runs to follow... 
EXT. DINER - MOMESTS LATER 
Jack pushes out the door, files under one arm, catching up... 
JACK I can't explain.  You wouldn't believe me anyway.  I'm trying to protect you... 
Jack gets one leg free, KICKS, knocks Flat-top backwards -- Flat-Top SLAMS the wall, falls.  Redhead lets go of one of Jack's arms, jams his elbow into Jack's throat... cutting off the airway.  Jack's face reddens... he's choking... 
Jack's free hand reaches, searching.. pulls Redhead's GUN and points it at him.  Redhead backs off. Jack gets up, gasping for air, PISTOL-WHIPS Flat-top as he rises. 
Jack grabs one of the files off the table. 
EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY 
Jack, without pants, in BOXER SHORTS, escapes out the BACK DOOR.  He looks at the ADDRESS on the file folder. 
EXT. STREET 
Jack SPRINTS down the middle of the street, gun in hand, looking like a complete madman.  Cars almost hit him. 
EXT. BANK BUILDING - LATER 
Jack, sweating and panting, stops, looks... then heads toward the BUILDING with the address "1888." 
EXT. 1888 LOBBY 
Jack tries the door.  Locked.  He lifts a cast iron bench, runs forward -- RAMS it into the glass.  The bench immediately recoils from the glass, SLAMS Jack's groin! Jack falls to his knees, doubled over, holding his package. Then, he rises, SHOOTS the glass... 
INT. 1888 LOBBY 
Jack pushes through the broken glass.  He sprints for the "PARKING" door... 
INT. GROUND LEVEL - PARKING 
Jack enters, looks -- NO CARS.  He bolts to the STAIRS... 
INT. TOP-LEVEL PARKING AREA - SEVENTH FLOOR 
Jack enters, heaving.  Again, NO CARS.  He moves from one SUPPORT POST to another, searching.  He finally spies, across the garage, NINE LARGE CANISTERS, heavily-WIRED. 
Jack runs to the BOMB, frantic.  He walks around it. There's a DIGITAL CLOCK, ticking down from "10:05"... 
Jack moves to pull the lid off one CANISTER, looks inside.. 
TYLER Could be worse... 
Jack looks -- Tyler's seated, his back against one post. 
TYLER You could be standing under 37 stories of steel and concrete with a 150 gallons of nitroglycerin strapped to the support... oh, maybe it couldn't be... 
JACK (points at bomb) You... you can't be serious about this. 
TYLER What a ridiculous thing to say. 
JACK I can't let you... 
TYLER ...go through with this? What are you going to do? 
JACK I'm going to... 
TYLER ...stop me? 
JACK I'm not going... 
TYLER ...to let this happen! 
JACK Stop finishing... 
TYLER ...your sentences!  They're our sentences.  Get your mind around that. 
Tyler gets up walks to Jack. 
TYLER What are you doing running through the streets in your underpants?  We both use that body. 
JACK Since when is Project Mayhem about murder? 
TYLER The buildings were evacuated thirty minutes ago.  Everything's proceeding exactly as planned. 
JACK You don't know that.  There could still be people inside. 
Tyler keeps walking around, crosses his arms. 
TYLER Maybe.  Maybe a couple of guys with shaved heads couldn't synchronize their watches.  Good riddance. 
Jack looks back to the BOMB, goes to it, wipes sweat off his face.  He starts finger the MANY WIRES, sorting them. 
TYLER I wouldn't be doing that.  Unless you know which wires, in what order... 
JACK If you know, I know. 
Jack holds his gun under one armpit, uses both hands to go through the tangle of colored wires. 
TYLER Or... maybe I knew you'd know, so I spent the whole day thinking about the wrong ones. 
Jack chooses one wire, GREEN, holds it in his fingers. 
JACK If I'm wrong, we're both dead.. 
TYLER This is not about martyrdom. 
Jack twists the GREEN WIRE around his finger. 
JACK I'm pulling the green wire. 
TYLER Green?  Did you say green? 
Tyler comes a little closer, leaning to try to get a look, seems genuinely concerned. 
JACK Yes... 
TYLER Don't pull the green wire.  Pull anything but the green wire. 
JACK Fuck you. 
TYLER I'm serious.  That's the wrong one. 
Jack's unsure, swallowing, pulling the wire taunt, fingers trembling.  The SOUND of a VEHICLE is HEARD from below... 
TYLER Hear that?  Marla's here.  Just in the nick of time, eh? 
Jack looks to Tyler.  Tyler points towards the SOUND... 
TYLER See for yourself. 
Jack gets up, breathing hard, holding his head, follows... 
ON THE STAIRS, Tyler reaches the LOFT LEVEL, above the lobby, disappears around a corner.  Jack's right behind, turning the corner -- Tyler's NOT THERE. 
Jack receives a SHARP SLAP on the back of the head.  He wheels.  Tyler isn't there.  A TAP on his shoulder.  Jack turns around -- WHAM! -- Tyler PUNCHES his face.  Jack falls against the loft railing.  Tyler comes forward, SWINGS... 
SECURITY MONITOR P.O.V. 
Jack PUNCHES himself square in the nose! 
INT. MAIN LOBBY 
Jack's dazed.  Tyler grabs Jack's shirt, pulls him forward, SWINGS HIM -- THROWS him DOWN THE STAIRS... 
Jack TUMBLES horribly down... HITS BOTTOM, striking his head on the floor.  Jack PASSES OUT... 
FADE TO BLACK: 
INT. LARGE SOCIAL ROOM - TOP FLOOR 
CLOSE ON: Jack's head jerks back as he SNAPS AWAKE.  He looks around, trying to focus his eyes... 
JACK'S P.O.V. -- TRACKS in the sawdust of the floor, from where his body was dragged across to where he is how. 
CLOSE ON: Jack tries to comprehend.  He turns his head -- TYLER'S HAND brings the GUN up, PUTS THE GUN IN JACK'S MOUTH.  Jack freezes, looks around with his eyes... 
PULL BACK TO: 
Tyler is seated in Jack's lap.  Tyler holds the gun in Jack's mouth, his arm around him.  This huge room is being remodeled.  Tyler and Jack are seated near floor-to-ceiling windows affording a spectacular view of the CITY. 
Tyler looks at his watch. 
TYLER One minute. 
JACK (V.O.) I think this is about where we came in. 
TYLER (looking out window) This is the beginning.  We're at ground zero.  Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion. 
JACK i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin... 
Jack tongues the barrel to the side of his mouth. 
JACK (still distorted) I still can't think of anything. 
Tyler checks his watch. 
TYLER It's getting exciting now. 
Jack turns, so he can see down -- 31 STORIES. 
TYLER Look what we've accomplished. (checks watch) Thirty seconds. (looks out windows) Out these windows, we will view the economic collapse.  One step closer to global equilibrium.  I'm glad you're here with me. 
Tyler watches the skyline, WHISTLES at tune, waiting. 
JACK (distorted) Can't you call it off... ? 
TYLER It's out of our hands. (looks at watch) This is it. 
JACK Please... 
TYLER Fifteen seconds now.  Can you see alright?  10... 9... 8.... 
Tyler looks out the windows, at SURROUNDING BUILDINGS, excited.  Jack closes his eyes, despairing. 
TYLER 
Out the window, the SKYLINE remains unchanged.  Nothing.  A long beat.  A very dark scowl comes over Tyler's face. 
Jack opens his eyes.  More waiting.  Tyler looks genuinely surprised, pissed-off. 
TYLER What the fuck -- ? 
JACK Paraffin. 
TYLER What? 
JACK (relieved) Paraffin.  Your merry band mixed the nitro with paraffin.  I saw it floating in the bomb. (more) 
JACK (cont) They must've run out of cotton and Epsom salt.  Paraffin is iffy at best. 
Tyler rises, taking the gun from Jack's mouth, starts pacing.  Jack rubs his sore jowls, allows himself a smile. 
TYLER Damn it!  God-damn it... 
JACK Not exactly according to plan. 
TYLER Do we have to do everything ourselves?! 
Tyler stops walking, lets out a sigh of disgust.  He reaches into his pocket, taking out a WALKIE TALKIE. 
TYLER (into WALKIE TALKIE) ... Codename Rooster.  Passcode First Strike... 
Jack's eyes go wide. 
JACK NO... 
TYLER (into WALKIE TALKIE) Proceed with remote detonation. 
Jack leaps -- TACKLES Tyler.  The GUN is knocked away.  Jack STRIKES Tyler's face repeatedly with his elbow, scrambles off... 
Jack gets the gun, turns, pointing it.  Tyler's getting to his feet, sees the gun, annoyed.  Jack stands. 
TYLER Haven't we already done this? 
Jack SHOOTS TWICE.  Bullets pass right thorough Tyler. Tyler just rolls his eyes, drops the walkie-talkie to the floor and STOMPS on it, CRUSHING it. 
JACK (pointing) How'd you do that?!  You're a fucking figment of my imagination... you're psychogenic fugue state... 
TYLER Fuck that, maybe you're my hallucination. 
Jack falters, pointing at Tyler's feet.  There's no walkie- talkie there.  Jack looks down, sees the WALKIE-TALKIE CRUSHED under his own foot. 
JACK Oh... Christ... 
Jack holds his head, walks around, at his wit's end. 
JACK Why... why... why... ?

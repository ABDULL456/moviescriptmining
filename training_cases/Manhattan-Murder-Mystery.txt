MANHATTAN MURDER MYSTERY 
Screenplay by 
Woody Allen & Marshall Brickman 
NOTE 
Most of the sequences in this production are filmed using a hand- held camera or a Steadycam. These very mobile cameras move around the set, and get constantly closer and further from the characters. Still, we'll be using the usual technical terms, such as «long shot» or «full shot» or «medium shot» here and there to give the reader an idea of the location of the camera at the beginning of each sequence. And then we'll mention the movements of the camera.

We hear jazz music during the credits. 
END OF CREDITS 
NEW-YORK - AERIAL VIEW - EXTERIOR NIGHT 
While the camera is flying over New-York, we keep on hearing the jazz music. 
The camera reaches a round building that looks like a stadium and starts moving around the building. 
HOCKEY GAME - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Long shot on the skating rink. A hockey game is in progress on the rink. The camera follows a player, and then pans on the audience. 
The camera stops on a medium shot of Larry and Carol, a couple in their early fifties. Larry seems fascinated by the game, but Carol seems to find it boring. She looks at the ceiling, and then puts her hand over her mouth to suppress a yawn. Larry turns toward her. 
LARRY Come on. 
CAROL What? 
LARRY You promised to sit through the entire hockey game without being bored and I'll sit through the Wagner opera with you next week. 
CAROL I know, honey, I promised. I know. 
LARRY I already bought the earplugs. 
CAROL Yeah. Well, with your eyesight, I'm surprised you can see the puck. 
The crowd starts yelling and we guess that one of the players has done something really good. Carol mockingly claps her hands. 
CAROL Yay, hooray. 
Then she raises her eyes to the ceiling, seeming more bored than ever. 
LARRY'S BUILDING - LOBBY - INTERIOR NIGHT 
A nice-looking apartment building in New-York. 
Full shot of the lobby. We see the street through the glass door. An uniformed attendant is standing near a counter, on which he is writing on a book. 
Larry and Carol are coming from the street and entering the building. He is carrying some shopping bags, and she is reading a newspaper, the «Daily News». 
LARRY God. I can't wait to get into bed and stretch out. 
CAROL Yeah. 
The attendant slightly turns around and bows to them. They bow back to him. He goes back to his book-keeping, and the couple keeps on walking through the lobby. 
LARRY You know, there's a Bob Hope movie on television later. 
CAROL know. Can you believe this guy in Indiana ? Killed twelve victims, dismembered them and ate them. 
LARRY Really ? Well, it's an alternative lifestyle. 
CAROL Yeah, I'll say. 
They reach the two elevators. Larry presses the call-button on the wall between the two elevators. 
LARRY'S BUILDING - ELEVATOR - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Medium shot inside the cabin of the elevator. The inner door slides open. Carol enters first, still reading her newspaper. Larry enters behind her and presses a button on the control panel. 
PAUL (voice over) Hold the elevator. 
LILLIAN (voice over) I'm coming. 
Hearing people's voices, Larry puts his hand on the edge of the door to keep it from closing. 
PAUL (voice over) Hold the elevator. 
Paul and Lilian enter the elevator. They are a middle-aged couple. He is bald and tall, and very smily. She is small, with grey hair. 
LILLIAN That's right. 
PAUL Thank you. 
Lilian has a broad smile when she recognizes Larry and Carol. The elevator door slides shut. Lilian looks at Carol. 
LILLIAN I, uh, I see you at the gym sometimes. 
CAROL Oh, you do ? 
LILLIAN Yeah, we live in the apartment down the hall. 
CAROL Oh, well, I go whenever I have the discipline. LILLIAN It's important to put that time in. It does wonders. 
CAROL Oh god, yeah. I agree with you. 
LILLIAN Exercising changed my life. 
CAROL Well, geez... 
LARRY I prefer to atrophy. I'm not a very exercise person. 
PAUL We bought a treadmill last week. 
CAROL Oh, well, we had one. But you know, we got rid of it because it was just taking up too much space. LILLIAN Oh, it-it-it... 
LARRY Because you have to turn it on and get on it once in a while. That was her problem. 
LILLIAN Hey, I... exactly, I... and it's so confusing, with all those buttons and computerized programs. I'm just never gonna get that. 
LARRY'S LANDING - HALLWAY - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Full shot of a very sober and modern hallway. Creme-colored walls, grey carpeting, dark wooden doors. 
We hear the elevator door opening and Carol comes out, followed by Lilian, Larry and Paul. They all talk together and we can hardly understand the following dialogue. 
CAROL Oh, I know. It's late. 
LILLIAN It's so wonderful, meeting. 
CAROL Oh, well, yeah. 
PAUL It is just like New York. You have neighbors. You never meet them... You guys... 
The following line, said by Lilian, is clearer and we understand it better. 
LILLIAN ... I've seen you so many times in the hallway, you know... and I've always wanted to come up and say hallo. 
PAUL Well, anyway... good night. 
Larry and Carol walk away from Lilian and Paul, who remain near the elevator. 
CAROL (voice over) Good night. Such a lovely couple. You know that... 
Paul bends down to pick up something on the carpet. Lilian walks one step in Larry's direction. 
CAROL Brown. 
LILLIAN Oh. PAUL Nice color. 
They all laugh. 
LILLIAN Paul never attended college. He's self-made. 
PAUL Always regretted it. I think knowledge is the second most important thing. First is health, then knowledge, then money. 
Larry puts his cup down on the low table. 
LARRY You know, it's amazing how time, we,... we'll just... 
LILLIAN And, do you work ? 
Larry stands up. 
CAROL Huh ? Do I ? 
LILLIAN Yes. 
Larry looks at Carol and sits back on the sofa. 
CAROL Oh, well, I actually, um, I used to work at an ad agency, but that was many years ago. 
The camera moves closer to Carol and Larry. 
CAROL But... You know, I've been seriously thinking of starting a little restaurant. But, well, Larry, he's trying to talk me out of it. 
LARRY Oh, she's a great cook, though, really. Her duck and fennel omelette on a bed of scallops and Hollandaise sauce with truffles and sweetbreads'll make you snap into a fetal position and have you in bed screaming for a month. 
CAROL He loves to tease me, but actually, he really loves exotic food. 
LILLIAN My weakness is any rich dessert, cream, butter, anything with fat. 
CAROL Oh, really ? Oh well, let... listen... I'll fix you a dessert that'll make your eyeballs roll up. You'll have to exercise for a month to work it off. LILLIAN Yeah. 
PAUL (voice over) We're going to Le Cirque for our anniversary. 
CAROL No, really ? 
The camera moves around, away from Larry and Carol, to Paul. 
LILLIAN (voice over) Yes. Twenty-eight years. November. 
CAROL (voice over) Really ? 
PAUL Well, what do you buy the woman who buys everything ? 
The camera moves around backward, away from Paul and back to Larry and Carol. 
LILLIAN We already have twin cemetery plots. 
LARRY Well, it's... I always think a Bentley is in good taste. You know, or you can go the route that I went with her. On her twentieth, I got her some very lovely handkerchiefs. 
CAROL Yeah. Oh no. But, you know, they had my initials on them. 
LARRY Yeah, it was a very, very high-class item. I didn't even know her size. I'm going over. Carol bursts out laughing. 
Black screen. Actually, we are in : 
LARRY'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Carol and Larry's apartment is quite different from the one we've just left. It is the apartment of a couple of New-York intellectuals, with nice, artistic furniture. We hear a door opening. 
LARRY Jesus, couldn't you keep the conversation going a little longer in there ? 
Lights are switched on. 
Full shot. We see only part of the hall, the camera being in a corridor, and the walls of the corridor concealing part of the hall. Carol enters the apartment, and Larry holds the door for her. 
LARRY I was signaling you frantically. 
Larry closes the door. 
CAROL I was just trying to be neighborly. 
LARRY Neighborly ? If this guy showed me his stamp collection one more time... I mean, my favorite thing in life is to, you know, look at canceled postage. 
The camera follows Larry walking in the corridor toward : 
LARRY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Actually there are two large beds in the bedroom, the room being divided by a partition set between the two beds. The partition is only a half wall. There is a opening, without door, at each end of the partition, to go from one section of the room to the other. 
CAROL (voice over) Oh, come on, Larry. It was sweet. They, you know, they're looking forward to their anniversary. 
Medium shot of Larry taking his jacket off. He puts it on a chair. 
LARRY Oh, and I'm looking forward to seeing that Bob Hope movie. I don't know why they put it on so late. 
The camera turns back to the corridor and Carol, still in the front hall. 
CAROL You know, do you think that's gonna happen to us ? 
LARRY (voice over) What ? 
Carol walks in the corridor, toward the bedroom. 
CAROL Well, that we'll become like them ? You know, just another dull aging couple, you know, with our little walks, you know... 
She walks into the bedroom. 
LARRY (voice over) We are a dull aging couple. 
CAROL Our TV, our lox and bagels. And... and our twin cemetery plots ? 
Larry is seated on his bed. Carol looks at some pills bottles on the night table. 
LARRY No, we should be as lucky as them. To, you know, to be in their physical shape, at their age ? They look great. Did you see the dumbbells this guy lifts ? If I lifted dumbbells like those, I would get a hernia the size of the San Andrea's Fault. 
CAROL How often do you think they make love ? 
She goes out of the main part of the room, and the camera follows her. 
She sits down on the other bed and starts taking her shoes off. 
LARRY (voice over) Oh, you know, probably more than we do, in their shape. You know, I'm sure as much as once a week. 
CAROL Larry ? 
LARRY (voice over) I'm exhausted. What ? 
CAROL Do you still find me attractive ? 
LARRY (voice over) Of course. What kind of question is that ? Of course I do. 
Carol stands up from the bed and moves across the room. The camera, still located in the main part of the room, follows Carol, so we don't actually see her walking, but we see the partition and the large clock on it. CAROL (voice over from behind the partition) Yeah, but we're not turning into a pair of comfortable old shoes, are we ? Do you think ? 
Carol reappears on the other side of the partition. 
LARRY (voice over) Never comfortable. 
CAROL No ? 
Larry's head appears in the forefront of the shot. He is still seated on the bed. 
LARRY I don't think you have to worry about that. 
MARKET PLACE - EXTERIOR DAY 
Long shot on a large outdoor antique market place in New-York. The camera pans along the stands in the market, showing sellers and customers. 
LARRY Th-Th-Th-The first time we saw them was last night. We just met them. W-We had... They invited us in for coffee. 
TALL NEIGHBOR Such a... S... Such a nice lady. 
OLD FEMALE NEIGHBOR Nice lady. 
NEIGHBOR WITH A MOUSTACHE Sweet person. 
NEW-YORK - LARRY'S RESIDENCE STREET - EXTERIOR NIGHT 
Full shot on the entrance of Larry's building. Larry and Carol are coming out. They are very elegantly dressed, Larry wearing a suit and a necktie. 
CAROL God, okay. 
LARRY You look wonderful. 
Paul is coming down the street toward the entrance of the building. He is carrying some grocery in a paper bag. 
CAROL Oh, hallo. 
PAUL Hi. 
CAROL Hi, Mr. House, so... sorry. 
PAUL Thank you so much for those wonderful flowers. 
Paul seems very relax. He smiles a lot, which could be surprising, when we understand he put his wife in the grave only a couple of days ago. 
CAROL Oh. 
PAUL It was quite nice of you. 
CAROL That's... sure. 
LARRY If there's anything we can do. You know, anything you need, just tell us and we'll... 
CAROL No, anything. Anything at all. I mean, God, it's just such a shock when anyone... It was just so sudden. I mean, she seemed so... God, well, healthy. 
LARRY Yeah. 
PAUL She had a heart condition. 
CAROL She did ? She never mentioned it... It... that she was... 
LARRY Ah. 
PAUL She wouldn't have. 
CAROL No. Right. Well... LARRY If there's anything we can do. 
CAROL Yeah, anything. Really. 
LARRY You know, if you need anything, if you are lonely, come by. You know. 
PAUL Thank you. You know, you owe me a wonderful French dessert. 
CAROL Oh, no, no, no. I know, I haven't forgotten. Believe me, I haven't forgotten. 
PAUL Well, have a nice time. You seem all gussied up. 
CAROL Yeah. Oh, I know. We're going to the opera. PAUL Oh, enjoy. 
LARRY My favorite, my favorite. 
PAUL Goodnight. 
He walks away toward the entrance of the building, still smiling a lot and looking very happy. Carol looks at him with a question on her face. 
LARRY Goodnight. 
CAROL Goodnight. 
LARRY Come, we're gonna be late. 
THE METROPOLITAN OPERA HOUSE - EXTERIOR NIGHT 
Long shot on the Met building. 
We hear the music from Wagner's The Flying Dutchman. 
The camera slowly tilts down. We don't see Carol and Larry yet, but we hear their voices. 
CAROL (voice over) The deal was, I sit through the ice hockey game and you watch the whole opera. 
The camera is now on ground level, and we see Carol and Larry coming out of the Met. LARRY I can't listen to that much Wagner, you know. I start to get the urge to conquer Poland. 
They cross the esplanade in front of the Met. 
ELAINE'S RESTAURANT - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Elaine's is a cosy place, like there are many around Greenwich Village. 
Carol and Larry are eating at Elaine's with Sy, Marilyn and Ted. Ted is a quite handsome man in his forties. 
We get a medium full view of the party, with a very mobile camera moving around the table and going from one person to another, getting closer to one person, then moving slightly away. 
SY I'll tell you something. I think it's weird. I mean, listen to this. One night she's having coffee, and the next night they are carrying her out in a rubber bag. 
CAROL Oh, I know, I know. And she did not look like she was ready to go. 
TED Maybe this guy killed her, you know ? Like, he's got, like, a young tootsie stashed someplace, or something. 
LARRY No, no, not this... you gotta, you gotta see this guy. This guy gets his jollies from licking the back of postage stamps. He's a-a boring old... 
TED Well, I can see that. Yeah, depending on whose picture is on the stamp. 
CAROL She never once mentioned that she had a heart condition. 
LARRY Well, what is she gonna say ? Oh, yeah, hello, I'm Mrs. House and I have a bad heart. 
CAROL Well, she had no problem telling me about her hysterectomy in the first five minutes. 
SY It is much easier to talk about a hysterectomy than it is to talk about a heart condition. 
TED You said she liked... she liked eating high cholesterol desserts. Is that what you said ? LARRY So, she had one too many. 
CAROL No. No ! She wasn't on a diet. We discussed diets. 
LARRY So she wasn't on a diet. But... 
TED This would be a really great way to kill somebody. 
SY How ? 
TED You clog their arteries with whipped cream, chocolate mousse, butter. They go like that. 
Carol is laughing very heartily at Ted's joke. 
SY That's great. 
LARRY I like a... It's disgusting. 
TED you know what I mean ? 
LARRY It's disgusting, but a... It's fatal. 
TED Wouldn't that be great ? 
MARILYN I'd like to French-pastry myself to death right now. 
SY I'll help you. 
MARILYN I really would. 
CAROL Yeah, I know. 
LARRY Let me speak to him, all right ? 
CAROL What? Oh. Here. Just a sec. Here's Larr... 
She gives the handset to Larry. LARRY Hey, listen. She was not murdered. She... she had a heart attack. It was a coronary. There was a doctor there. He said to.... He was an old man. 
RESTAURANT - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Close shot on Ted, drinking from a mug. 
TED How do you know it was a real doctor ? 
LARRY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT 
LARRY I'm not gonna touch that. I'm tired. I want to go to sleep. Look... 
RESTAURANT - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Medium shot of Ted. 
TED Wait-wait-wait a minute, wait a minute, put Carol back on, I called about something else. Listen, I know a great location for a restaurant. 
NEW-YORK - A YARD - EXTERIOR DAY 
A yard in the middle of old New-York buildings. 
The camera is located at the inner end of the passage leading from the street to the yard. We gets a full shot of Carol and Ted coming from the street and walking toward us and the yard. 
TED Hah, look at this. Isn't this great ? CAROL Well, it's dark. 
TED Aren't these walls great ? A cave, you know, like you have to go through a little cave. 
CAROL Oh, I see. 
TED And then you come out, to this here. 
They have reached the yard. The camera moves back to get a medium shot of them both. 
CAROL Oh, look at this though. It's really so beautiful. 
TED Yeah. Isn't it great ? CAROL But... it's kind out of the way for a restaurant, isn't it ? 
TED No, no... that's the appeal. That's just the appeal, because it's... it's, I mean it's so romantic... tucked away back in here like this. 
The camera leaves Carol and Ted in the middle of the yard and moves up and around to show us the old building around the yard. 
CAROL (voice over) Yeah. 
TED (voice over) And, you don't want street traffic. You want... 
CAROL (voice over) No. 
TED (voice over) you want a little out of the way spot that people hear about and lovers go to. 
CAROL (voice over) Yeah. 
TED (voice over) It takes months to take a reservation, you know ? Very few tables. 
The camera moves down to ground level to give us a better view of the yard. It does look a bit neglected, with weeds growing in between the stones covering the ground. There are some trees and a small out-of-order fountain with a statue on top of it. CAROL (voice over) You know, you've really thought this out. 
TED (voice over) Oh, well, I used to come here all the time with-with July, when we were married. 
CAROL (voice over) Uh uh. Right. 
The camera moves back to Carol and Ted. 
TED Used to walk around here. Really beautiful at night. It's gorgeous at night. 
CAROL It's beautiful, I bet. 
TED I used to think, «What am I doing here with July ? We don't love each other any more», you know ? It made the moment doubly poignant. 
PAUL'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Medium shot of the corridor, showing the front door. Paul opens the front door. Larry and Carol are standing in the doorway. Larry is wearing a necktie and Carol is carrying a large tray. 
PAUL Hi. How are you ? 
CAROL Hi. How are you ? 
PAUL Oh, my... 
CAROL These are my floating islands. I hope you like meringue. 
Paul takes the tray from Carol's hands. 
PAUL I love it. Come on in, come on in. 
CAROL Well, okay. 
PAUL This is unbelievable. 
Carol enters the apartment, followed by Larry. 
CAROL I know, it's just... 
PAUL Did you do it ? Larry closes the door behind him. 
CAROL I did do it. I told you. Anyway, this has got... this is vanilla sauce here and I put little chocolate truffles. 
PAUL Well, come on in. 
CAROL Do you like chocolate truffles ? 
PAUL Would you share it with me ? 
LARRY Oh, no. She made these just for you. This is... 
CAROL Oh, well... PAUL'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT 
They all enter the living room. 
PAUL No, no, no, it's too much for one. I'll I make some coffee. Please. 
LARRY They're only half a dozen. 
CAROL No, no, no. Look, I'll make the coffee. That'd be better. Let me make it. 
PAUL Oh, you've already done so much. 
CAROL No, no. I insist, I insist. Go on, sit down, relax. 
She takes the tray from Paul's hands. 
PAUL Aren't you nice. 
CAROL Enjoy yourself, you've been through enough. 
She walks to the kitchen, carrying the tray. 
LARRY She worked on those for... How're you holding up ? 
PAUL Oh, I don't know. I was thinking after a while. I'd get away from here. From this place and all its memories. LARRY Uh uh, so you have someone to go with, or are you... 
PAUL I have a brother in Florida. 
LARRY Oh, really ? 
PAUL I'm hoping he can get away for a while. 
LARRY Good. It's a good idea. 
CAROL Hey, I'm not tired. 
LARRY What do you mean, «You're not tired» ? 
CAROL You know, Ted's gonna check with the funeral home, tomorrow. 
LARRY Great. CAROL You know what I mean ? I mean, I don't understand why you're not, not more fascinated with this. We could be living next door to a murderer, Larry. 
LARRY Well, New York is a melting pot. You know, get used to it. 
LARRY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Later in the night. 
Medium shot on the bed. Larry is asleep, but Carol is not. She moves in the bed, and then sits up. She turns around, pats her pillow, and tries to lie back on her side. But she sits up again, looking around the room. Eventually, she gets out of the bed. 
She walks around the bed in the dark, and switches on the lights in the corridor. The camera follows her in the corridor. 
LARRY'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT Carol switches the lights on in the hall, then she looks into the peephole in the front door. 
CAROL Oh my God ! 
The camera turns around toward the corridor. Larry is getting out of the bedroom, putting his slippers on. 
LARRY Hey, are you okay ? 
Carol walks in the corridor toward him. 
CAROL Larry. Larry, I heard a noise. I-I-I heard a noise in the hallway, so I just... I... You know, I-I looked and I think... I think Mr. House was getting on the elevator. 
Larry hops toward her, still trying to put his slippers on. She backs up and they are now both in the front hall. 
LARRY Yeah ? You're sure ? 
CAROL Yeah, you know, I was... I'm-I'm... almost certain that it was him. 
LARRY So-So-So what ? 
CAROL Just, you know... I mean, who else could it be ? 
LARRY So what ? It's not a crime. He can get on the elevator. CAROL I know. I know. But wh-who would it be at one-thirty in the morning ? 
LARRY Oh, Jesus. I was in a deep sleep. What-What's the difference ? 
CAROL But, you mean, you know how we're always complaining about living on the geriatric floor. Do you know what I'm saying ? A joke ? 
While Larry is answering her, Carol opens the front door and peeks into the hallway. 
LARRY All right, so it was Mr. House. So he got on the elevator. It's not a felony. The guy pays rent. He's entitled. I mean, what... Can you go back to bed ? This is crazy. You woke me up out of a deep sleep. I gotta get up early tomorrow morning. 
Carol closes the door, and walks toward the kitchen. The camera follows her. 
LARRY'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Carol looks through a notebook. 
CAROL I know what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna ring him up. I'm gonna ring his apartment. I'm gonna see if he's home. 
LARRY (voice over) You're gonna ring Mr. House, now ? 
CAROL Yes, because this is really... 
LARRY (voice over) What are you talking about ? 
CAROL It's very sus... 
Larry joins Carol when she already has the handset in her hand. But she succeeds in dialing Paul's number. 
LARRY Don't ring Mr... What are you doing ? No, don't ring... 
CAROL Let me just... Larry, don't. Wait. 
LARRY Don't ring Mr. house. This is a widower. Leave the poor guy alone. You're crazy. Stop it. Carol listens to the phone. 
CAROL That's one ring. 
LARRY So you saw him go out. It's not a-not a crime. 
CAROL Okay, two rings. He's not there, yet. 
Larry takes the handset from Carol's hand. 
LARRY Give me this. Give me this. 
CAROL What are you doing ? 
LARRY Look, if you want to find out if somebody left, just call downstairs. Call the-the-the person at the desk. CAROL All right, I'll call. Just keep ringing. 
LARRY Ask if someone went out. 
CAROL Keep ringing. 
LARRY Yeah, um. Sure, I'm gonna keep ringing. You got it. 
While Carol walks out of the kitchen, Larry puts the phone back on its hook on the wall. 
CAROL Oh, man. 
Carol walks into the hall. The camera follows her. 
LARRY'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT 
LARRY (voice over) This is insane. What's gotten into you ? 
Carol picks up the building internal telephone handset from the wall. 
CAROL I don't know. What is he doing ? Where is this guy at one- thirty in the morning ? You know what I'm saying ? 
LARRY (voice over) It's not your business. He can go any place he wants. 
CAROL (in the phone) Hallo ? Yes, hallo. This is Mrs. Lipton. Yes. Did anybody just leave the building ? I'm just... hmm. You're sure ? You're sure no one ? No, okay. All right. Yes. Thank you. 
While she was talking on the phone, the camera has moved toward Larry, standing at the entrance of the kitchen. 
LARRY Okay. Are you happy ? 
We hear the noise of the phone being put back on its hook. 
CAROL I don't believe this. Man, I don't get it. 
Larry joins his wife in the hall. 
LARRY Now, can we back to bed ? 
CAROL No. LARRY For crying out loud, it's no big deal. You're making a mystery where nothing exists. 
CAROL Just let me think about this a second. Okay, I got it. Wait. I know, it... No, wait. Listen to me. Larry... Listen. He got on the elevator, okay ? 
LARRY You know, I'm gonna... 
CAROL No, wait. No, no, listen to this. No. 
LARRY I wanna go to sleep. I don't want to be standing here in the middle of the night. 
CAROL I know. Larry, he got on the elevator and he took it to the basement. 
LARRY Oh, great ! Great ! So what ? Now, what've you got ? 
CAROL He has a car, right ? He's got the garage door key, he opened... he could... he has the... 
LARRY So what ? So what ? 
CAROL What do you mean, «so what» ? He's... 
CAROL The urn is missing. It's gone. Yeah, I think it might have been. He had this satchel last night. He was carrying this bag, and I think that might have been what he had in his satchel. 
TED'S APARTMENT - SITTING-ROOM - INTERIOR DAY 
Close shot of Ted's back. He is still seated at his desk and talking on the phone 
TED Listen, I'd get out of there right away, if I were you. 
The camera moves around Ted, showing the typewriter he is typing on. TED No, no, no. Go, go, go. We'll do... We'll talk more from your apartment. 
PAUL'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR DAY 
Same shot of Carol on the phone. 
CAROL He's not going snorkeling with his brother. He's got two tickets to Paris, and he's got reservations at the Georges Cinq hotel with a woman named Helen Moss. 
She turns around, because she feels she heard a noise in the landing hallway. 
LARRY'S LANDING - HALLWAY - INTERIOR DAY 
One of Paul's neighbor is standing in the hallway, waiting for the elevator. He's got some documents in his hand. The elevator dings and the door opens. Paul comes out. NEIGHBOR Oh. Hi. How are you ? 
PAUL Good morning. How are you ? 
Paul has his key in his hand and is ready to open his apartment door. 
NEIGHBOR Good. You got the notice on the... Uh, maintenance increase ? 
Paul turns around to look at the neighbor. 
PAUL No. When did that happen ? 
PAUL'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR DAY 
Close shot on Carol, whispering in the phone and looking toward the front door. 
CAROL I'm gonna look around and see what else I can dig up here, okay ? Yeah. I'm telling you, this is just... Ted, I-I'm just dizzy with freedom. This is just... uh, this is just the craziest thing I've ever done. 
TED'S APARTMENT - SITTING-ROOM - INTERIOR DAY 
Close-up shot on the ashtray, where a cigarette is burning slowly. The camera pans to a close-up shot on Paul's face, still on the phone. 
TED Yes, it's crazy. But soon, we'll be too old to do anything crazy. Go, leave, leave, leave. 
PAUL'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR DAY 
Carol puts the phone down on the desk. She stands and turns around when she hears the front door opening. 
Black screen shot on the front door in the dark of the corridor, then the camera quickly spins around to show Carol, standing in the living-room, with a frightened look on her face. She walks away from the room. The camera spins back to the front door, which opens. Paul enters and switches the lights on. He closes the front door, and walks along the corridor to the living-room. 
Carol walks into the kitchen from the living-room. 
The camera pans to Paul, looking for something on his desk. He looks through all the documents scattered on the desk. 
The camera pans back to Carol, hiding in the kitchen, then back to Paul. Paul opens both his hands in a gesture of despair : apparently, he hasn't found what he was looking for. He starts walking across the room, and the camera pans back to Carol in the kitchen. She rushes out of the kitchen. 
The camera remains at the same spot, and we see Paul in the living-room, still looking for whatever he is missing. He walks out of the living-room through the kitchen. 
PAUL'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY 
Paul enters the room, looking in the inner pocket of his jacket. He walks around the room, and opens a closet. He looks through the hanging clothes, and finds a few documents in one of the jackets. He closes the closet, and starts looking through the documents he has found. He puts them inside the inner pocket of his jacket. He starts walking out of the room, when the phone rings. He stops and picks up the phone receiver on one of the night-tables. 
PAUL Hallo. 
Medium shot of Carol hiding under the bed. We notice she doesn't have her glasses anymore. 
PAUL (voice over) Oh, hi. Yeah. I know. I-I...Yes, I miss you, too. I did. I made all the arrangements. 
Back to Paul standing by the bed and talking in the telephone. 
PAUL Yeah, look. I... Okay, I have to run. But I'll see you later, okay ? Okay. 
He puts the phone down on its hook, and starts walking out of the room. He stops, thinks for a couple of seconds, turns around, sits on the bed and picks up the phone. Back to Carol under the bed. The bed frame hits her back when Paul sits on it. She looks up. We hear Paul dialing a number. 
PAUL (voice over) Extension five. Well, keep ringing, would you please ? Because I just talked to her. What ? Okay. Uh, will you tell her... yes, tell her that Tom called. Tom. Thank you. 
Back to Paul sitting on the bed. He puts the phone down on its hook, stands up and starts walking out of the room. 
Back to Carol under the bed, waiting for Paul to get out of his apartment. 
NEW-YORK - A STREET - EXTERIOR DAY 
Starting from street level, the camera tilts up along a very modern office building, all glass and steel. A sign, above the main entrance, says «10 East 53». This is the building where Larry's office is located. LARRY'OFFICE - INTERIOR DAY 
Full shot of a large office room. In the forefront, a reception desk, with a young female receptionist talking to someone we still don't see. Coming from the other end of the room, Larry is walking with Marcia, a tall dark-haired lady, wearing sunglasses. 
LARRY So, I thought your rewrites were great. I really think you helped your book, you know ? It's... It's dense a little bit, but, uh... 
MARCIA Well, I don't want it to be too transparent, I mean... 
They are now at the reception desk level, and, since the camera is following them, we can see the young gentleman the receptionist is talking with. 
LARRY That's... That's something you're never gonna have to worry about, you know ? This book makes «Finnegan's Wake» look like airplane reading, you know ? But-But it's long. It's- It's-It's... 
They are now walking along a corridor. 
MARCIA You know, you're the only editor in the world I'll take suggestions from, but even you shouldn't push it. 
LARRY No, I'm not pushing it. I think the book is great. Absolutely great. You know, but, uh... how much, how much of Dorothy is you? As I was reading it, I kept thinking how much is... you know, how much did you base it on your own life ? They have now reached a smaller room, actually Larry's private room. Marcia takes her glasses off, and then her coat, and sits on a sofa. 
MARCIA Well, I was a waitress. I lived with a poet. I was a film critic. 
LARRY (voice over) Right, but not-not a blackjack dealer, right ? 
MARCIA No, but I put myself through school playing poker. 
The camera pans to Larry, who is standing up at the other end of the room, looking through some documents. 
LARRY Oh, really ? Do you still play ? 
MARCIA (voice over) No, but I still know how. LARRY Yes ? Are you good ? 
MARCIA (voice over) Yeah. 
LARRY Yeah, because maybe you could give me some pointers. 
MARCIA (voice over) I could turn your game around in two hours. 
LARRY Could you ? That's great. That's... you know, you-you have all these skills, and you're beautiful, and you can write so well... and now it turns out you play poker. This is, uh, too good to be true. 
Larry sits down with the pile of documents on his laps. The camera pans back to Marcia. She has a cigarette in her hand. 
MARCIA Well, I wouldn't say beautiful. 
LARRY (voice over) Oh, I would. 
MARCIA But I do have tremendous sex-appeal. 
The camera pans back to Larry, who is looking through the huge pile of paper on his laps, perhaps a manuscript. 
LARRY Okay, you sold me. Are-are you seeing anybody ? 
MARCIA (voice over) No. Don't let my confidence fool you, it's a facade. Why do you ask ? 
LARRY Because I have a friend who became single recently, and I-I know he would get a big kick out of you. 
MARCIA (voice over) Oh. So, when do you want your poker lessons ? 
LARRY Uh, next week. I could take you to lunch. We could-we could, um, I'll put you on my expense account, and you could... teach me when to... bet and when to fold. 
MARCIA (voice over) How about a cheeseburger right now ? 
The phone rings. 
PAUL (voice over) Well, we only show revivals now. This week, we have Fred Astaire. Next week, we have an Orson Welles festival. HELEN (voice over) Oh, yeah ? 
PAUL (voice over) Yeah, it'll be about the last thing we do before we start renovating. 
The camera keeps on panning around the room. 
HELEN (voice over) Mm. Oh, Paul, I... 
PAUL (voice over) Oh, come on, there's nobody around. 
We hear moaning and kissing sounds. 
HELEN (voice over) I-I... 
PAUL (voice over) Come on. 
HELEN (voice over) Okay. 
PAUL'S MOVIE HOUSE - BACKSTAGE - INTERIOR DAY 
Full shot of the backstage behind the screen. In a corner, a stairway going to the top of the backstage. Half-hidden on the stairway, Carol and Ted. 
HELEN (voice over) I've never been behind a movie screen before like this. 
PAUL (voice over) Strange, isn't it ? 
HELEN (voice over) Yeah. 
PAUL (voice over) Used to be a first-run house when the neighborhood was better. 
The camera pans to the back of the screen, in front of which Paul and Helen are standing. 
HELEN Oh. 
PAUL Beautiful, huh ? Look around. 
HELEN All these mirrors. 
The camera pans around the room, where a lot of huge mirrors are stacked. PAUL Huh ? Well, it used to be all mirrors, and it was quite beautiful. 
The camera tilts down to give us a closer shot on the mirrors. 
PAUL (voice over) I'm having all this broken glass replaced as we go along with this renovation. You know, they used to have stage shows, here. Now, of course, we only show old movies. 
The camera tilts back up on Paul and Helen. 
HELEN It has such a lonely feeling. 
PAUL That's because I'm the only one here. And my assistant, Mrs. Dalton. I'm gonna have this place fixed up, then I'm gonna sell it. The money's gonna come in handy. HELEN It sure will. 
Paul looks around, a bit worried. 
PAUL What's that noise ? 
HELEN Where ? 
The camera pans to the other side of the room, where a middle-aged woman with red curly hair has just entered. She is Gladys Dalton, Paul's assistant. She is walking with the help of a cane. 
PAUL (voice over) Oh, Mrs. Dalton. I didn't know you were here so early. 
GLADYS Oh, uh, I-I didn't know whether an-anyone was here. I-I'm sorry. I-I-I heard the noise and I thought... 
PAUL (voice over) It's quite all right. 
GLADYS But, but, uh... 
PAUL (voice over) It's quite all right. 
GLADYS I apologize. 
PAUL (voice over) Quite all right. 
GLADYS All right. 
Gladys Dalton starts going out of the room and the camera tilts up on the stairway, on which Ted and Carol are still hiding. 
HELEN (voice over) I'd love to really get an acting job. I had it with this modeling. 
PAUL (voice over) Maybe you won't have to work at all. 
Ted and Carol are moving away from the stairway, which remains empty. 
LARRY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Close shot on the clock on the wall : the time is just after one o'clock. The room is completely dark and the clock is the only source of light. The camera pans to the bed and on Carol, sound asleep. We hear a noise, like an object dropping down. Carol instantly wakes up. She gets up and the camera pans to Larry, still asleep. He eventually wakes up, moves around in the bed, takes his glasses from the night-table and put them on his nose. 
CAROL (whispering in voice over) Oh, my God. 
Slowly Larry gets out of the bed. 
LARRY What's the matter ? 
CAROL (voice over) Larry, come with me, okay ? 
Larry starts walking along the corridor. 
LARRY Oh, Geez, I was... 
CAROL (voice over) Come on. 
LARRY I was fast asleep. I was dreaming of round card girls. 
LARRY'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Larry has reached the front hall. Carol is looking through the peephole of the front door. 
CAROL Okay. Uh, it looks like he's gone. Yeah. Yeah. He's gone. 
LARRY Oh, Christ. Not that again. Please, you know... 
CAROL Listen, Larry. I want to take another look around his apartment. Yeah. 
Carol walks along the corridor toward the bedroom. Larry follows her. 
LARRY What are you talking about ? Where're you going ? 
CAROL Listen. 
LARRY It's-It's one o'clock in the morn... 
CAROL He'll never be back, Larry. 
LARRY What ? What ? 
LARRY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT CAROL No, he's not coming back. Not for at least an hour, an hour and a half. 
LARRY What-What're you doing ? You got his key ? 
CAROL Yeah. 
LARRY You're kidding. What are you talking about ? You can't do... Why... because you-you followed him to the movie house, you-you said there was nothing happening. 
CAROL No, wait a minute, look, he was with this young model type, and they were talking about money. 
Carol is putting her shoes on. 
LARRY Well, so what ? That's the... 
CAROL So, that's the motive. 
LARRY What... Hey, listen to me. Come here. 
CAROL What are you talking about ? 
CAROL Oh, oh, wait. Look. 
She starts looking through the mail scattered on a table. 
LARRY What ? What do you wanna do, go through the guy's mail ? This is insane. 
He starts looking through the mail. 
CAROL What do you mean ? 
LARRY Oh, my... As he takes some more letters, Larry hits a small porcelain statuette, and drops it on the floor, where it breaks. He bends down to pick up the debris. 
LARRY Jesus. Oh, Christ ! 
CAROL What are you do... Well, just... Clean it up, Larry. Clean it up. 
Larry stands up. 
LARRY What do you mean, clean it up ? What am I gonna do, vacuum ? 
CAROL Put it under the rug, or something like that, okay ? 
LARRY I can't. It's a wall-to-wall carpet. I broke his-his-his- his... porcelain... 
He looks at the porcelain pieces in his hands. 
CAROL Well then glue it. Glue it back to... 
She moves around the room. 
LARRY What do you mean, glue it ? What are you talking about ? 
CAROL Oh, look. Look. 
LARRY What ? 
CAROL Look. 
She shows him a pair of gloves she just picked up on a low table. 
LARRY So what ? Gloves. I have gloves. They keep my fingers warm. 
CAROL So ? I know. I know, but you keep yours out on the bureau in this kind of weather ? Uh ? 
LARRY Let's get out of here, because this is a... 
CAROL I think something's very strange, here. I mean, he left these out and ready. I think the whole thing is really sinister. LARRY It's eye of the beholder. What you have... you've got to go to the eye doctor, get happy glasses. 
He pushes her toward the exit of the room. 
CAROL What ? 
LARRY Look, I'm gonna take the pieces with us, and we'll-we'll get rid of them. 
NEW-YORK - CLUB TWENTY-ONE - EXTERIOR DAY 
Medium shot of the famous entrance of the club 21, with the line of painted cast iron lawn jockey statues which adorns the balcony above the entrance. The camera zooms backward to give a full shot of the entrance of the club. 
NEW-YORK - CLUB TWENTY-ONE - INTERIOR DAY 
Full shot on the lobby of the club. On the right, a counter with an attendant behind the counter. Facing us the entrance of the main room. Carol, Larry, and their son Nick, are coming out of the room. Nick must be in his early twenties. 
CAROL So, how did you like your birthday cake, Nick ? 
NICK I loved it, I... 
CAROL I know. 
NICK I loved... But then again, I love chocolate anything, so... The camera moves around the three people as they walk toward the cloakroom. 
CAROL I know. 
LARRY Right. 
CAROL I know. What-What-What are you laughing about ? 
NICK Well, I... 
LARRY If only he could stay in town-If only could stay in town just a couple of more hours. 
NICK I know. I was going to, but I... CAROL Well, what about that ? 
NICK They're working us so hard at school. I can't. 
CAROL Oh. 
They've stopped in front of the cloakroom. 
NICK I gotta get right back. 
CAROL Really. 
LARRY I'm gonna take him to Brooks Brothers for his present. And- And-And, uh... 
NICK Brooks Brothers. Yeah. 
LARRY Your mother's going to a wine-tasting. 
CAROL You're going to get something from Brooks Brothers ? 
NICK Yeah. A sweater. 
LARRY She's going to a wine-tasting. Can you believe that ? 
CAROL Well, if I'm going to be a restaurant owner, I should know something about wines. Don't you... Larry ? 
Larry walks across the lobby, because he has seen someone he knows in the sitting-room. He waves his hand and comes back to his wife and his son. 
LARRY Hi. Hey, I want you to meet somebody. 
CAROL What ? 
The camera pans around, to show us Marcia crossing the sitting- room. 
LARRY I want you to meet somebody. This is, this is... 
MARCIA Hi, Larry. LARRY Hi. How are you ? 
MARCIA Good. How are you doing ? 
LARRY This is my wife. 
Marcia has reached the lobby. 
CAROL Honey, I'm here. I'm right o... 
LARRY You snuck around. 
CAROL Carol. Remember me ? 
LARRY Yeah. This is Marcia Fox. 
The two women shake hands. 
CAROL Oh, hi. 
MARCIA Hi. 
LARRY My son Nick. He's in town on, uh... 
MARCIA Good to see you. 
LARRY It's his birthday, so we took him to Twenty-One. 
CAROL Okay. TED Well, you know, you would be my first choice. 
CAROL Me, huh ? 
TED Yeah. 
Carol laughs. 
CAROL Well. Oh, boy. 
TED Well, you... Can I give you a lift ? Do you, uh, I'm gonna go east. Do you... 
CAROL Thanks. No, I-I think I'll stick around, I need to think. I need my... I feel a little, you know, tipsy. TED I didn't offend you by what I said, did I ? 
CAROL No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You didn't offend me, no, I was very, uh, flattered by this, Ted. Flattered. Well, anyway. 
TED See you later. 
He stands up and bumps into a low table in front of the sofa. 
CAROL See you. Oops, careful. Whoops. 
TED Sorry. Excuse me. 
CAROL Excuse me. 
Carol looks at him walking away with a strange expression in her eyes. 
NEW-YORK - STREET IN FRONT OF THE LOUNGE - EXTERIOR DAY 
Medium tracking shot of Ted walking on the sidewalk, coming from the lounge and toward us. 
Medium low-angle shot of one of the window of the lounge, seen from the street. This shot is low-angled because the lounge is located slightly above street level. Carol is seated in front of the window, looking very pensive. She takes a sip of her glass of wine. She looks absently though the window. 
NEW-YORK - A LOUNGE - INTERIOR DAY The street seen through the window, next to which Carol is seated, but we don't actually see Carol. We see a big car, followed by a bus. The camera zooms on the bus. Through one of the bus windows, we see a woman, seated inside the bus. And this woman looks very much like the deceased Lilian, Paul's wife. 
NEW-YORK - STREET IN FRONT OF THE LOUNGE - EXTERIOR DAY 
Close shot on the window, in front of which Carol is seated. She looks at the passing bus, with a wide open mouth, and a surprised, almost frightened, expression on her face. She stands up a little and then sits back. 
NEW-YORK - A LOUNGE - INTERIOR DAY 
Full view of the room. In the background, Carol, still seated by the window. She stands up, picks up her purse, and starts crossing the room, bumping into people. She reaches the staircase, and walks downstairs. 
NEW-YORK - STREET IN FRONT OF THE LOUNGE - EXTERIOR DAY Full view on the entrance of the lounge. Carol is walking rapidly down the stairs leading to the entrance. She reaches the sidewalk, and looks around her for the bus. She walks away from the lounge and toward us, with the camera on a tracking shot in front of her. 
LARRY'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR DAY 
Medium shot of Larry working in the kitchen, putting things away in the cupboards. Behind him, we see the front hall. The front door opens and Carol walks in. 
LARRY I got a great sweater at Brooks Brothers' today for Nick, today. 
Carols closes the door and leans on the wall. But Larry doesn't seem to understand that something is wrong with her. He walks away to the sitting room. He keeps on talking in voice over, while Carol is still leaning on the wall of the front hall. 
LARRY (voice over) Really beautiful. It's cashmere. Very expensive. The kid looked so handsome in it, though. Also, I decided I'd cook dinner tonight. My one dish tuna casserole. 
Larry comes back in the kitchen and looks at his wife, but still doesn't seem to notice that something is wrong. We follow Larry into the sitting-room. 
LARRY'S APARTMENT - SITTING-ROOM - INTERIOR DAY 
Larry is setting the table for dinner 
CAROL (voice over) Well, no wonder he had her cremated. 
LARRY What ? 
CAROL (voice over) Mrs. House. 
LARRY Oh, Jesus. You're not about Mrs. House again. I thought we'd have a light dinner, you know, because we had a rich lunch at Twenty-One, I thought. 
The camera pans to Carol standing at the entrance of the room and leaning on the wall 
CAROL Larry. 
LARRY (voice over) What ? 
CAROL I just saw Mrs. House. LARRY (voice over) What are you talking about ? The ashes ? 
CAROL No, no, no. A bus. It passed me, and she was on it. 
Larry joins Carol. 
LARRY Uh, the dead woman passed you on a bus ? Which bus was this, the bus to heaven ? 
Larry walks away toward the kitchen. Carol follows him. 
CAROL No, but I'm not, I'm not joking. I mean, I'm telling you something. I'm telling you, I really saw her. I actually saw her. 
LARRY'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR DAY 
Larry is checking his cooking. 
LARRY Uh-huh. Uh-huh. 
CAROL Yeah. 
Larry takes two wine-glasses out of the sink. 
LARRY You want to lie down for a while ? We'll put a cold compress on your head, or a hot compress on your back, or... 
CAROL No, Larry, you know, I was at the wine-tasting, right ? And I was just... I was sitting at, you know, a bay window. I-I happened to look out. A bus passed, and she was on it, Larry. 
LARRY Remember I said to you ? Yes, remember I said to you, spit it out ? 
CAROL I... 
LARRY I said don't drink it. You said you were going to a wine- tasting ? 
CAROL But ? 
LARRY You said you were going to taste wine all afternoon ? I said spit it out ? CAROL Yeah... 
LARRY I said don't swallow it ? You swallowed it. And that's why you're this way. 
CAROL I know. I know. Okay. I-I... Yeah. I had a few drinks, but it's-it's not... I mean, I saw her. 
Larry puts the glasses away on the dinner table. 
LARRY Yeah, I 'm sure you saw her. 
CAROL I ... 
LARRY How could you see her ? She's dead. Not only is she dead, she's been cremated. It's not even Halloween. 
They walk into the sitting-room. 
LARRY'S APARTMENT - SITTING-ROOM - INTERIOR DAY 
CAROL Okay. Are you telling me that you... That, that, that, that you... That I didn't see her ? Is that what you're saying ? 
LARRY I think it's a pretty fair assumption that if a person is dead, they don't suddenly turn up in the New York City transit system. 
CAROL I just... I just don't know what's happening, Larry. I-I-I don't know what's going on. 
LARRY What's going on ? 
CAROL What's... yeah. 
LARRY Let me put it this way : total psychotic breakdown. Okay ? Is that enough ? 
CAROL I... 
LARRY Maybe, look. Maybe she's a twin. That's possible. Now forget this. 
CAROL I mean, I know he didn't see Mrs. House, Larry. 
LARRY If she's a twin, it's a different story. But you don't seem to feel she is, so... CAROL Well, I don't know. Oh, I know. Unless he's in on it. 
LARRY Who's in on it ? The super ? The super can't change a fuse. 
The lady, sitting next to Larry, just gave the couple a bad look, and Carol taps on Larry's arm. 
CAROL Shh !... Shh !... 
A short pause. 
CAROL I mean, she... 
LARRY What ? 
CAROL Well, she's alive. And my question is, who was in that bag. I mean, somebody... 
LARRY She's not alive, unless she's a twin. Okay ? Now keep quiet... 
CAROL Look, somebody... Somebody got cremated, Larry. Somebody. 
LARRY Shut up. 
NEW-YORK - STREET IN FRONT OF THE LOUNGE - EXTERIOR DAY 
Long shot of Ted and Carol walking toward us in a quiet street. Actually it is the street where the wine-tasting lounge is located, and, of course, the street where Carol saw the bus with Lilian on board of it. They walk near the entrance of the «National Arts Club». Ted is holding a small notebook and looking at what is has written in it. 
TED Lillian House. 
CAROL Right. 
TED Uh, maiden name, Lillian Beagle. Born in Carlyle, Pennsylvania, nineteen-thirty-five. Married Paul Richard House. 
CAROL Right, I know. 
TED She was not a twin. Had an older sister who... CAROL So goes Larry's theory. 
TED Uh, went to England twenty years ago, and an older brother who died in nineteen-eighty-seven. 
Carol stops in front of the building next to the «National Arts Club». It is the building where they had the wine-tasting session the day before. 
CAROL Right here. This is it. 
TED This is where we were. 
The camera tilts up to show the window behind which Carol was sitting the day before. 
CAROL (voice over) This is where we were. I know. And I was sitting right here, after you left. 
The camera tilts back down to Ted and Carol. 
TED Right. 
CAROL And I was having a glass of, you kn-you know, wine, and I looked out the window, and-and I saw the... right here. 
Carol shows Ted the spot where she saw the bus. 
TED You saw her after I left ? CAROL Yes, I saw... her on a bus. It was passing. You... It was, like. 
She walks in the middle of the street. 
TED Wait a minute. Are you... You're absolutely sure you saw her ? You saw her face ? 
CAROL I'm positive I-I saw her. 
A car is honking. Carol, still standing in the middle of the street, moves out of the way of the car. 
CAROL Whoo !... Excuse me. I-I'm telling you, Ted. 
Ted joins Carol in the middle of the street. 
TED What was the number of the bus ? 
CAROL Uh, I don't know what the number of the bus was, but I know that it was heading west to east, so it was... it obviously was a cross-town bus. 
TED All right. Okay, look, look. It's a cross-town bus. 
They walk to the sidewalk on the other side of the street, where the park is located. 
CAROL Right. 
TED Okay, so look. The end of the line is a few blocks down there. 
CAROL So, okay. So, then, it's like... 
TED So, she... She had to get off somewhere... somewhere. 
CAROL Then... Her destination was probably within the next five or six blocks. 
They start walking on the sidewalk, going the way where they first came from. 
TED Yeah, right. So, let's, let's look around. Let's, we, we'll see some, you know, uh, like a, like a, you know... clue, or something. Or something. Maybe we'll see her. You're sure you saw her face ? CAROL Don't, don't doubt me, okay ? 
TED Okay, okay, okay. No, no, no, no. 
CAROL I'm-I'm not kidding. Look. 
NEW-YORK - A WIDE AVENUE - EXTERIOR DAY 
This is not a nice area anymore. It is a wide dingy-looking avenue, with the nearest buildings very far away and a road bridge over the street. And it is raining. 
Long shot of the avenue, with Carol and Ted walking further away. 
CAROL Oh, God. Well, I think, you know, I think we've reached the end of the line. TED I think this is it. 
A bus is coming toward them. 
CAROL Look. The bus. 
The bus slows down. 
TED I don't think... there's noth... Watch out. Watch out. 
Ted pushes Carol so she doesn't get soaked by the bus driving very close to the sidewalk and into the pools of rain. 
CAROL Yeah, what ? Oh. Whoo !... 
The bus makes a U-turn on the avenue. 
TED Yeah, look. See ? See, he's turning. That's it. 
CAROL Yeah, I know. 
TED That's all there is, here. 
CAROL Well, what do you think ? 
RED What ? 
CAROL Do you think we should retrace our steps ? NEW-YORK - STREET IN FRONT OF THE LOUNGE - EXTERIOR DAY 
They are back in the same street where the wine-tasting place is located. 
Full shot of the park across the street, seen across the thick vertical bars of the railings that surround the park. Ted and Carol are walking on a lane in the park. 
TED You-you wear a tie with a dress. It's a... It's a very special... 
The camera follows Ted and Carol, moving on the other side of the railings. 
CAROL No, I don't think it looks good, and I don't even know if it looks... I mean, I feel like it'd be to masculine if I wore it with a pair of pants. TED Oh, it'd look great on you. No, no, just don't wear it with pants. 
CAROL Oh. 
CAROL You know, I... 
LARRY I took you to see «Last year at Marienbad» on our first date ? 
CAROL Yeah, I know. I had to explain it to you for the next six months. 
LARRY Who knew they were flashbacks ? You know. 
CAROL Look, Larry. Look. We've got plenty of time to be conservative. You know what I'm saying ? Don't you see ? 
The camera starts moving around the car. 
CAROL It's to me, it's like this-this tantalizing plum has just, like dropped into our laps. I mean, life is just such a dull routine and here we are, right ? I mean, we're on the threshold of a genuine mystery. I mean, to me, the whole thing is like. It's... Hey, no. The camera stops moving on another medium shot, where we still see Larry through his open window, but we see Carol only through the wet windshield. 
LARRY Are you gonna burst into a song, here ? We're in a car. 
CAROL Just don't make fun of me, okay ? Because I'm open to new experiences. 
LARRY Let me ask you a personal question, here. 
CAROL Yeah. 
LARRY Did you ever sleep with Ted ? 
CAROL Sleep ? 
LARRY Don't get nervous. Yeah. Yeah, you guys... 
CAROL What, are you nuts ? 
LARRY We were on an eating tour of France, together. 
CAROL Yeah. 
LARRY You two guys spent an evening, you know, together. CAROL Yeah, right. We sp... 
LARRY At that place, you know. 
CAROL I know... Yeah, but what about you ? Remember ? You spent the evening with Julie. Am I right ? You spent the night, and shared a... 
LARRY That meant absolutely nothing. She hated me. Julie despised me. 
CAROL What ? 
LARRY You know that. She-She thought I was a low-life and a wimp and a vermin and a roach. Just-Just jump in anytime you want to defend me, you know. 
CAROL Hey, I mean, I'm waiting for you to say something I don't agree with, okay ? 
LARRY Ho-ho ! Hey, you're nailing me... Jesus !... 
He stops smiling because he just saw something in front of his car, something we don't yet see, because the camera hasn't moved from its position. 
CAROL Oh. Larry. 
LARRY Yeah. 
The camera starts panning very rapidly toward the entrance of the hotel. 
CAROL (voice over) Larry, Larry, look. It's her ! I'd say it's her ! 
A lady carrying a white open umbrella is entering the hotel. 
LARRY (voice over) Oh my god, it is. 
CAROL (voice over) Yeah. You see what I mean ? See, so I was right all along, wasn't I ? 
LARRY (voice over) Can you... Are you sure ? Are you sure ? 
CAROL (voice over) I'm positive. Yes. 
The camera starts panning back toward Larry's car. 
LARRY (voice over) Oh, my God. 
CAROL (voice over) Right ? Right ? I mean, I was... 
Medium shot of Larry and Carol in the car, seen through Larry's open window. 
LARRY I'm... Jesus, I'm sh... 
CAROL I know. W-Well. Come on. 
LARRY That is her. Are you... CAROL Yeah. I know. 
LARRY I told you so. 
CAROL What do you mean, you told me so ? What are you talking about ? You're nuts, honey. 
LARRY Oh, Jesus. I'm flabbergasted. 
CAROL Yeah. No, look. You're white. You're completely white. 
LARRY I know. All the blood rushed to my brother. 
CAROL Larry ! 
LARRY I don't know what to do. 
CAROL Let's go. Let's get out there. Let's find out what's going on. 
LARRY No, I don't want to. 
CAROL Oh, come on. Y-You're not afraid of her, are you ? 
LARRY No, I'm not afraid. CAROL You're not afraid of Mrs. House. 
LARRY She's an old woman and I'm a virile male. 
CAROL I know. 
LARRY And yet somehow I am scared. I don't know why. Maybe because she's dead. You know ? 
CAROL Let's go. You know, I tell you, I'm gonna break this thing wide open. 
LARRY Well, how ? What do you want to do ? 
CAROL I'm... You know, I'm... God, if only Ted were here with us now. You know what I'm saying ? 
LARRY Oh, don't give me Ted ! Wh... Let's... Let's... Wh... Let's get out of here. 
CAROL No, wait. I got an idea. 
LARRY What ? 
CAROL I know what we should do. We should get a gift, right ? 
LARRY What ? 
Carol gets out of the car. 
CAROL We'll surprise her. We'll sneak into the hotel. Come on. 
LARRY How ? How ? 
CAROL Yeah, no. Come on. 
Larry gets out of the car. 
HOTEL WALDRON - LOBBY - INTERIOR DAY 
A modern clean lobby, with a very conventional decoration. Medium shot of a clerk cleaning the lobby floor with a broom. She is a woman in her forties, very casually dressed with a flowered blouse and a beige sweater, and with uncombed hair hanging on her shoulders. The camera pans around toward the street door. Carol enters the lobby, followed by Larry. Carol is holding a small present-wrapped parcel in her hand and walks toward the clerk. 
CAROL Uh, excuse me. Hi. 
HOTEL WALDRON - SIXTH FLOOR HALLWAY - INTERIOR DAY Same shot of the long corridor as before. We see Carol and Larry coming out Room 611 and running toward us. 
LARRY Come on, come on. Move, move. Adrenaline is leaking out of my ears. 
They reach the end of the corridor, and the camera follows them as they run around the corner of the hallway. 
LARRY Get down those stairs. 
They don't use the elevator and instead run down the stairs. 
CAROL Okay, all right. 
LARRY Come on, come on. Quickly. NEW-YORK - STREET OUTSIDE THE WALDRON HOTEL - EXTERIOR DAY 
Long shot of the entrance of the hotel, seen from the other side of the street. A blue police car is parked in front of the hotel. Two plainclothes police officers and one uniformed policeman are talking with Carol and Larry. They both try to explain the situation to the police officers. But since they both talk together, the police officers have a hard time understanding them. 
While they are talking, the camera zooms forward from a long shot to a full shot of the group. 
CAROL (talking together with Larry) And then, you see, what happened was I suspected Mr. House, right ? He's a... He runs a movie house. But-But then what hap... We're sit... I saw her on this bus, right ? And... And she has... no place at all. Then we checked anyway. So we were just sitting there, just waiting... 
LARRY (talking together with Carol) We-We-We were there. She-She was very nervous. So-So we were going to the movies, and, and, and we were walking and looking around the place. And then suddenly she's a... Her hand is on the floor. You could see it on the side of the bed. She was lying there, she was sort of... like blue in the face. The girl was nervous. I tried to keep calm, as best as I could. 
One of the plainclothes police officers stops their talking. 
FIRST POLICE OFFICER There's nobody up there. 
CAROL There's what ? 
LARRY What do you mean, there's nobody up... FIRST POLICE OFFICER There's nobody. 
CAROL Wait a minute, wait... 
SECOND POLICE OFFICER There's no body there. 
CAROL We-We saw... 
LARRY We just saw her there. She's lying on the floor. 
CAROL We... 
SECOND POLICE OFFICER (talking to the uniformed policeman) Mike, check the basement with... He starts climbing the few steps to the entrance of the hotel, followed by Carol and Larry. The other police officer remains on the sidewalk. 
LARRY She was totally dead. 
CAROL We... She's there. 
LARRY Wait, wait. 
HOTEL WALDRON - ROOM 611 - INTERIOR DAY 
Medium close shot of an uniformed policeman, different from the one we just saw in the street. 
CAROL (voice over) She was right here. She was lying, like, right this-a-way. 
LARRY (voice over) Yeah, she was definitely laying here. 
The camera pans from the uniformed policeman to the two police officers talking with Carol and Larry in the middle of the room. The following dialogue transcript separates what Larry says from what Carol says, but, most of the time, they talk together at the same time, making it quite difficult for us, or for the police officers, to follow their conversation. 
CAROL Because, I mean, she was, she was there, do you understand ? 
The camera tilts down on one of the police officers looking under the bed. LARRY The... Y-Yes. She was... It looked like she was strangled, or something. Not-Not that I'm an expert on violent death, because I wouldn't know. 
CAROL We're-We're two professional people. 
LARRY Right, I'm a... I-I work at Harper's. 
CAROL Yeah. 
LARRY I'm in publishing. 
CAROL Yeah, that's right, and I'm-I'm looking to start a little restaurant, basically French, although international cuisine would be fine. Not that I really have a location... LARRY Right, she's a fantastic cook. But, uh, I'm against the restaurant, myself, but-but she's a wonderful cook. 
FIRST POLICE OFFICER Calm down. Calm down ! Please ! 
CAROL Okay, just... 
LARRY Look, obviously what happened is, in the time it took you guys to respond... somebody came here and removed the body. Not that you didn't respond quickly, you know, you were here fast. It took-took you three minutes, not-not-not counting the half-hour that the operator 911 took to understand what I was saying. 
FIRST POLICE OFFICER Nobody is doubting you, okay ? We're going over the whole building, all right ? 
CAROL All right. 
NEW-YORK - STREET OUTSIDE THE WALDRON HOTEL - EXTERIOR DAY 
Medium shot of Carol, Larry, the first plainclothes police officer and the uniformed policeman we first saw in the street. 
CAROL Uh, did you check... 
FIRST POLICE OFFICER Mr. House... 
The second plainclothes police officer joins the group. SECOND POLICE OFFICER ...He's been at his place of business all day. 
LARRY Any witnesses ? 
CAROL Yeah, b... 
SECOND POLICE OFFICER Uh-huh, backed up and corroborated. 
CAROL Yeah, but you didn't use our names, or anything like that, did you ? 
SECOND POLICE OFFICER No, we didn't. 
CAROL No, okay. SECOND POLICE OFFICER I don't know. If you think you saw his wife, shouldn't you tell him ? 
CAROL No, I'm... No, I mean, he's in some sort of scheme, here. It's... 
FIRST POLICE OFFICER We think you should calm down and file a report. 
CAROL It's not... Oh ! 
FIRST POLICE OFFICER This way, if anything turns up, we got it on record. 
He gives his business card to Larry. 
CAROL All right. 
FIRST POLICE OFFICER Take a card, give us a call, have a good day. 
CAROL Thank you. Thanks very much. 
SECOND POLICE OFFICER Bye-bye. 
The two police officers walk away with the uniformed policeman. Larry looks at the card in his hand. 
CAROL Thanks very much. Oh, man, I don't know how we're gonna... 
LARRY Jesus, I gotta have a drink. I gotta calm myself. I need fourteen Zanacks or something. 
CAROL Where is Ted ? I just don't understand where Ted is. I mean, you know, all this stuff is happening. 
They start walking away on the sidewalk, while the police officers are climbing in their car. 
LARRY Ted ? Ted-Ted's, you know, he's got his date with Marcia Fox tonight. He's probably out buying some Spanish Fly. 
CAROL Do you think Helen Moss might be in on this ? 
LARRY Helen ? I don't know and... 
CAROL I think so. LARRY I don't want to know about this. I think we should change our lives. 
CAROL No, think about it. 
LARRY We should move out of that stupid apartment, you know. You know, start over maybe in Mexico. 
The clerks goes and gets the key of the room. He gives it to Carol, who drops the card on the small counter under the window. 
HOTEL NIGHT CLERK Is there any trouble ? 
LARRY No, no, no, no, no. I-m-I'm-I'm-I'm j... I'm-I'm ju... um... I'm a detective. They-They-They lowered the height requirements, so I... I'll take this card back. They-re, they're... 
He takes the card from the counter and puts it back in the inside pocket of his jacket. 
CAROL Come on. 
LARRY ...expensive. 
Carol walks toward the elevator and Larry follows her. 
HOTEL WALDRON - SIXTH FLOOR HALLWAY - INTERIOR NIGHT 
As before, the camera is located at one end of the long corridor, showing Larry and Carol at the other end of the corridor ready to enter Room 611. Larry keeps looking around while Carol is opening the door. 
HOTEL WALDRON - ROOM 611 - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Full shot of the room with the door in the background. The door is opening slowly. Carol enters the room, followed by Larry 
CAROL Okay. 
LARRY Be careful. 
CAROL Telling me to be careful. Now, just don't upset anything. Okay, Larry ? 
Larry closes the door. 
LARRY I'm not upsetting anything. I just, you know, I'm just gonna leave a-a set of fingerprints around, so if there's a trial, we can get trapped. 
The camera follows Carol and Larry moving around the room. 
CAROL All right, now look. The murderer must have, like, hid in this closet, right ? 
Carol opens a closet. 
LARRY I don't like this. 
Carol gives a quick peek inside the closet, and then closes it. CAROL Right, and then he must have... 
LARRY Let's go. You know, I've got to get up early tomorrow. I've got to be in temple. 
CAROL Okay, he must have dragged the b... The body out, really fast. What ? 
We hear a click coming from the door of the room. 
LARRY Shhh !... 
Larry picks up a metal lamp from the floor and hides behind a closet in front of the door with Carol behind him. The door opens and the cleaning lady walks in with her bucket and things. Larry is ready to hit her, but, when he realizes who she is, he drops the lamp. The cleaning lady yells. CLEANING LADY Ahhh !... Oh, Jesus! What... 
LARRY I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm... Didn't mea... I-I, oh, it's- It's-It's a... 
CAROL Oh, hi. 
Larry opens the door and pushes the lady out of the room. 
LARRY You don't have to turn the bed out. It's not necessary. And no-no-no croissants tomorrow for breakfast. 
He takes some money out of his pocket and gives it to her. 
LARRY Here, here. Here, take this for yourself. I like the towels. Keep the little mints coming on the pillow, uh... 
He closes the door. 
CAROL Oh, Jesus. Larry. I mean, really. 
LARRY Let's go. That's why the light was on. This is crazy, we're gonna get in trouble. 
CAROL Just a second, Larry. Let me just look around here, just a little bit. 
Larry picks up the lamp which is broken in two pieces. LARRY Oh, look. I did damage. I... Now. I'll be sued. 
CAROL (voice over) Oh ! Larry ! 
LARRY That's what ? 
Carol comes back to Larry, holding something small in her hand. 
CAROL Larry, look. Look. I thinks that's her wedding band, Larry. 
LARRY How do you know ? 
CAROL How do I know ? I saw it on her. 
LARRY You did ? CAROL Yeah. 
LARRY Jesus. 
CAROL I think so. 
LARRY So much for the police combing every inch of this place. Where did you find it ? 
CAROL I found it behind the door, right there. 
LARRY Oh, brother. Let's get out of here, come on. And take the ring with you. Maybe there's a pawnshop open. 
CAROL Okay. Okay. 
Larry opens the door and they walk out of the room. 
HOTEL WALDRON - ELEVATOR CABIN - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Medium shot inside the cabin. The elevator is moving down. 
CAROL Didn't I tell you the police weren't thorough ? I mean they probably thought we were cranks, right ? I mean, we got no body, and... I mean, they must get fifty crisis calls a minute. Why would they bother with us ? 
LARRY I don't know. I just know, this is very deep stuff. CAROL Just... 
LARRY We should not be here. I'm scared, this is creepy. You know what I mean ? This goes... this could be... Who knows who's involved in this ? This could go very deep, Carol. This could be like, you know, like with the Warren commission, or something. I don't like it. 
CAROL Oh, not the Warren Commission. 
There is a loud noise and the elevator suddenly stops. 
CAROL Oh, my God ! 
LARRY Jesus ! What is that ? CAROL Wait a minute. Okay, all right, now look. All right. The- the elevator's probably stuck. 
LARRY Why are we stopping ? Why are we stopping ? 
CAROL Relax now, Larry. 
Carol starts punching all the buttons on the control panel. 
LARRY Don't tell me to relax ! I'm-I'm-I'm a-a world-renowned claustrophobic. 
CAROL It's okay. It's okay, everything's going to be fine. 
LARRY Stop. Hit something. 
CAROL I am hitting it. 
LARRY I don't like this, I don't, I don't... 
CAROL I know, I know. It's okay. 
LARRY It's easy for you to say, but I can't breathe, I'm phobic. 
CAROL The-the idea is, there's plenty of air, in this elevator. Uh, Larry, relax. Now, if you just don't panic, okay ? Don't panic, all right ? LARRY I'm not panicking, I'm not panicking, I'm... 
CAROL Now, just don't worry. 
CAROL Hey. 
PAUL How are you ? 
CAROL H-How are you ? 
PAUL May I introduce Gladys Dalton, my gal Friday ? 
CAROL Mrs. D... How are you ? Nice to see you. 
Carol and Larry shake hands with Gladys. 
PAUL This is Larry and Carol, my neighbors. 
CAROL Yes. GLADYS Nice to see you. 
PAUL We were just watching Madame Bovary. Wonderful. 
GLADYS Such a sad story. 
CAROL Yeah, it is. We, you know... 
LARRY She-She-She gets cremated. She gets killed at the end. 
CAROL Yeah. 
PAUL Yeah. Listen you gotta stop up for a drink before I go on my trip. 
CAROL Love to. 
PAUL See you later. 
CAROL See you later. 
PAUL Oh, incidentally, if you hear of anybody who needs an apartment, I think I may be moving. 
CAROL Oh, well, it... PAUL See you later. Come on, Gladys. 
He puts his hand on Gladys' shoulder and start walking away with her. 
CAROL What a shame. 
PAUL Good night. 
CAROL Good night. 
The camera follows the departing couple, Gladys still walking with the help of a cane. 
LARRY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Medium shot of Larry and Carol, sitting in their bed. They've already put on their nightclothes and they have a last talk before going to sleep. 
LARRY Oh, Jesus. What a day, huh ? I can't figure it out. It's got to be that either he's a... 
CAROL What ? 
LARRY Either she's a twin, or he's a twin. 
CAROL He... He... 
LARRY Or they're multiple personalities, or you're a twin or I'm a twin. 
Carol laughs. 
LARRY Because I don't know what's going on. 
CAROL You're nuts. 
LARRY You know, look. 
CAROL Wait, wait, yeah. 
LARRY Let me be logical about this. 
CAROL Okay, she's not a twin. We know she's not a twin. LARRY Hey. 
CAROL What are you talking about, Larry ? 
LARRY Stay calm. I want to try and puzzle this out. 
CAROL I'm calm, Larry. Okay, but okay, she's a twin, she's not a twin. I mean, now you're saying we are twins ? What are you, nuts? Okay, I'm calm. I'm calm, okay. 
LARRY Yeah, I'm going to be logical. 
CAROL All right, all right. 
LARRY The, um, the first thing is this. 
FLASHBACK SCENE LARRY'S LANDING - HALLWAY - INTERIOR NIGHT 
The door of the elevator opens. Inside the cabin, Larry and Carol are smiling and talking. 
LARRY (voice over) We came home that night. There had been a heart attack. 
Some neighbors are gathered around Paul's apartment door. Larry asks them questions. 
LARRY (voice over) Uh, what if they induced it ? You know, some kind of poison. We never saw the body. 
The camera pans inside Paul's corridor, where Mrs. House's body, completely covered by a white sheet, is lying dead on a stretcher with the doctor and the emergency medical team around her. 
LARRY (voice over) You know, it had to be some other woman. You know, some- some woman who probably had some kind of ballpark resemblance to Mrs. House. 
The camera pans around to the group of neighbors standing in the hallway. 
LARRY (voice over) The super says he saw her, but, uh, he's a drunk, you know. Mrs. House could have been hiding. 
LARRY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Back to Larry and Carol sitting in their bed. LARRY But you-you remember that you heard a noise that night. That had to be Mrs. House leaving to check into the hotel. 
CAROL Yeah. Yeah. Well... 
LARRY I can't sleep. I just, I... 
CAROL No, wait a minute, wait. 
LARRY I'm too, you know... I'm too... 
CAROL But it doesn't make any sense at all, Larry, because suddenly, you know, he murders her. I mean, what's it all about ? 
LARRY Let me, let me call Vincent's restaurant in New Jersey... and why don't we go meet Ted and Marcia and get something to eat, and talk with them. 
CAROL Wait a minute. At one in the morning ? What are you talking about ? You mean... You wanna... 
LARRY Yeah, so what ? So what ? It's so, you know, Ted-Ted was taking her to a show and to-to-to dinner... so they'll be there. 
CAROL All the way out to New Jersey... 
LARRY So, hey, kid, this is the apple. This is the town that never sleeps. That's why we don't live in Duluth. That, plus I don't know where Duluth is. 
He picks up the phone on his night table. 
LARRY Lucky me. 
VINCENT'S RESTAURANT - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Vincent's is a nice cosy place, with dim lights, tasteful decorations, and light piano music. 
Full shot of a table with the four customer seen in profile. Larry is seated next to Marcia, and across from his wife. Ted is seated next to Carol. During the following conversation, the camera moves around the table. 
TED Uh, you really saw his face ? CAROL Yes. Oh, yes, I'm here to tell you... 
TED You saw, you saw what he looked like ? No question. You know exactly who it is. 
TED Yeah, just... Whenever, you know, whenever you feel it. Whenever you feel into it. 
Ted walks away. Helen takes a very deep breathing, sits down, puts her hands trough her hair, takes another breathing, and picks up the phone handset from the telephone on the table. She overdoes it a lot, trying to act as the prima dona she is not. 
HELEN Yeah, okay. 
She dials a fake number on the phone keyboard. 
HELEN Hello, Joe ? I-I was just... I... 
TED (voice over) Uh, let me stop you right there. 
Helen looks in Ted's direction. 
TED (voice over) I'm sorry, I... uh, if you'll be... if you'll start out more frightened... then that'll take you where you're gonna go. 
HELEN Right, right. 
She breathes deeply before starting again. 
HELEN Hello, Joe ? I can't talk much, now, and if I sound strange, don't get alarmed. 
Later. Helen is auditioning another scene. She doesn't have the phone in her hand any more. She is holding a script and looking at it. Larry is seated in front of her, and read his own script on his clipboard. 
HELEN Give me your hand. Hold on. Try not to fall. Hold on. 
LARRY I'm trying, I'm trying. 
HELEN Quickly ! Hurry ! 
Later. Close shot of Helen's face auditioning another scene. 
HELEN They're asking two hundred thousand dollars for it. Yeah. They say it's Monet, but I say it's a fake. 
Medium shot of Helen, seen from behind. We see Sy standing behind his camera on her right, and Larry standing with his clipboard in his hand on her left. In the background, Ted, Marcia, Marilyn and Carol listening to her. While Helen is talking, the camera moves backward through the opening in the scenery. 
HELEN Ever since Joe came home from Vietnam, he's cast a pall on everything. A dark cloud, a pall. 
A BUILDING - EXTERIOR NIGHT. 
Full shot on the upper level of a building, that could be either Ted's theatre of Sy's workshop. The camera tilts down to street level.

We are inside Sy's workshop. It is full of very high-tech video and audio equipment. 
Medium shot of Marilyn standing behind a computer. Close to her, Carol is seated on a table, and Ted is standing next to her. They are both looking at a large video monitor. On the monitor screen and on the computer screen, we see the same picture of Helen auditioning with the telephone in her hand. 
HELEN'S VOICE Hello, Joe ? I can't talk much, right now... 
The camera pans to Marcia, seated behind Carol and also looking at the monitor. Behind her, Sy is looking at another monitor, and manipulating some switches on an editing machine underneath the monitor. Larry is standing next to him. 
HELEN'S VOICE ... and if I sound strange, don't get alarmed. 
Sy rewinds the video tape. 
HELEN'S VOICE Hello, Joe ? I can't talk much right now. 
Sy fast winds the tape.

Close shot on Ted's face, then the camera pans to Carol and Marcia, seated one behind the other, and behind them, Sy working on the editing machine, with Larry standing next to him. The camera zooms on Sy. 
HELEN'S VOICE ... he's cast a pall on everything. A dark cloud, a pall. 
Sy rewinds the tape. HELEN'S VOICE A pall. 
Sy rewinds the tape. 
HELEN'S VOICE Pall. 
Sy rewinds the tape. 
HELEN'S VOICE Pall. 
Slightly later. Medium close shot of Ted looking at something we don't see, with Marcia standing next to him. 
HELEN'S VOICE Hello, Joe ? 
The camera pans to Carol standing up and looking at the same thing as Ted. We hear Helen's voice distorted by Sy's editing machine. HELEN'S VOICE (distorted) Hello, Joe. 
The camera pans back on Ted and Marcia, then it pans to a close shot of a big high-tech tape recorder, on which Sy is working. We see his hands cutting off a short section of the audio tape, and gluing back the two severed ends of the tape together. 
Full shot of the room. In the foreground, Sy is working on his tape recorder. On his right, Larry is standing and looking at him. On his left, Marilyn also looking at him. Behind him, Carol, Ted and Marcia, all looking at him.

The camera zooms on Ted and Marcia. 
Close up shot on the tape recorder. Sy starts it. 
HELEN'S VOICE Hello, Paul ? I can't talk much, right now... 
The camera tilts up from the tape recorder to a medium shot on Ted and Marcia. Ted smiles when he hears the work Sy has done with the tape. HELEN'S VOICE ... and if I sound strange, don't get alarmed. 
MARCIA (SMILING) Perfect. 
She shakes hands with Larry. 
TED That's great. He also shake hands with Larry, moving slightly Carol out of the way. 
MARCIA You did great. Great. 
Larry suddenly notices that Carol has been excluded from the hand- shaking party, and he turns around toward her. 
CAROL Well, yeah, it's, excuse me, hey, don't worry, yeah, okay. 
MARCIA Fantastic. 
MARCIA'S CAR - INTERIOR DAY 
The camera is behind Marcia, who is driving in a street in New- York. We see Helen walking on the sidewalk. 
MARCIA There she is. The camera pans around, from inside the car, to get a better shot of Helen. 
TED Where ? 
MARCIA You have to keep her busy for all afternoon. 
Through the back window of the car, we see Helen entering a restaurant called «Time». 
TED Yeah, yeah, okay. Okay, yeah. Yeah, I'll-I'll just keep improvising, you know ? 
MARCIA Okay, well, it shouldn't be too hard. She's a hungry actress, you're a playwright with a role. 
NEW-YORK - A STREET - EXTERIOR DAY 
Close shot on Marcia's car, inside which Marcia and Ted are talking together.

SY AND MARILYN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY 
HELEN'S VOICE Hold on. 
Marilyn, who has just been playing her player, presses the «stop» button on it. Then Marcia presses the «mute» button on the telephone. Meanwhile, Larry has succeeded in getting a good length of tape out of his cassette, and tries to put it back in ! 
PAUL'S MOVIE HOUSE - OLD DRESSING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

CAROL What ? 
LARRY You can't press some... Come on. Marcia presses the «mute» button on the telephone, and Carol presses the «play» button on her player. 
HELEN'S VOICE You have no choice, they've got the goods. You just pay them off, or get rid of them. I have to hang up. 
Marcia presses the «off» button on the telephone.

PAUL I'm fine, I'm fine. 
GLADYS You're different. 
PAUL I said I was fine. Will you stop interfering ? 
GLADYS You never used to pull away from me. 
PAUL (getting mad) I told you to leave me alone ! I don't want to have this conversation all the time ! 
He walks out and Gladys put her hands on her eyes. She slowly walks away with the help of her cane. 
NEW-YORK - STREET OUTSIDE SY AND MARILYN'S HOUSE - EXTERIOR DAY 
Full shot of a nice building with short trees and wrought iron gates in front of it. We hear voices but we don't see anyone yet. 
LARRY (voice over) Great. All right. Now, my job is to wait exactly one hour and call Mr. House from a phone booth. Where are you... Where are you running so fast ? 
Carol runs out of the building. 
CAROL I have to go home and change. 
Larry comes out of the building and closes the door. Carol turns toward him. 
CAROL I've got an appointment with a friend of Ted's about a location for... What ? 
LARRY What's the matter ? What are you so angry about ? What are you so... What are you so steamed up about ? 
CAROL What do you mean ? Well, I meant... I just don't understand how you could give a book to Marcia, and not to me. 
They start walking down the street. The camera follows them. 
LARRY What are you talking about ? 
CAROL I just don't need... LARRY We had just a big success in there. 
CAROL What... 
LARRY Marcia likes to read what I like to read. 
CAROL Oh, right, God. Yeah, well it's true. I guess it's true. I mean, we've got nothing in common, that's for sure. Now that, now that Nick's grown up, I mean, you know, we're just left facing each other. 
LARRY You got stuff in common with Ted, right ? You can cook together with Ted, or you can take your clothes off and baste a chicken with him. 
CAROL Oh, right. Oh, oh, well, what about you and Marcia, huh ? What does she teach you besides poker ? That's what I'd like to know, okay ? 
LARRY Mud wrestling. Is that what you want to hear ? Nothing, I'm her editor. 
CAROL Look, I think the time has come for us to reevaluate our lives. 
LARRY I reevaluated our lives. 
CAROL Yeah. LARRY I... I... I got a ten. You got a six. 
The camera stops moving and just shows just the departing couple walking down the street. 
CAROL Well, listen, I think maybe I will go back to seeing my shrink. 
LARRY Oh. You don't have to see your shrink. There's nothing wrong with you that can't be cured with a little Prozac and a polo mallet. 
CAROL Just... I just would like to be alone for a while, okay, Larry ? 
LARRY What are you talk... CAROL Just... just, I... I... Uh, okay ? 
Long shot of Carol running away, while Larry, standing in the middle of the sidewalk, looks at her going away. 
A CAFETERIA - INTERIOR DAY 
A classical New-York cafeteria, with tables and chairs scattered all around the room. In the background the long counter, where the food is displayed, and along which the customer are lining up at lunchtime. Around a slightly isolated table on the left, Ted and Helen are talking. 
HELEN So, I have this, like, really crazy father and everything. 
TED Oh, yeah ? 
The camera zooms to a medium shot on Ted and Helen. 
HELEN And, yeah. He's wanted, like, in three states. He has a terrible driving record. So we had to move from Virginia then to New Jersey, and... 
TED So, your father is wanted in three states for driving ? Really ? 
HELEN Yeah, for driving. Yeah. So I moved to Hackensack, and then... Well, anyway, I was in all these different contests and I was even, uh, Miss, uh, Teenage Passaic. 
TED Oh, how wonderful. 
LARRY'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR DAY 
Medium shot of the room. The front door opens and Carol walks in. She slams the door shut and puts her purse on a table. She takes her coat off, walks into the corridor and opens a closet to put the coat away in it. She then chooses a new set of clothes and shoes to go to her appointment. She closes the closet and walks into the bathroom to change. She closes the bathroom door. The camera remains outside the bathroom and starts moving along the corridor back to the front door. The front door opens and Paul walks in. He walks silently along the corridor toward the bathroom. 
A CAFETERIA - INTERIOR DAY 
Same medium shot as before on Ted and Helen. 
TED Was that before or after the fourth abortion ? HELEN Well, after the fourth, but before the drama prize. 
TED The drama prize ? 
DEAD END STREET BEHIND PAUL'S MOVIE HOUSE - EXTERIOR DAY 
Medium shot on Larry and Paul, still fighting. Larry succeeds in getting away from Paul, who fires his gun. But, apparently, Larry is not hit by the gunshot, because he runs toward the back entrance of the movie house. The camera follows him. PAUL'S MOVIE HOUSE - BACKSTAGE - INTERIOR DAY 
Medium shot on the staircase on the side of the backstage. Larry runs down the stairs, while we hear the sound of the «Lady from Shangai». «The Lady from Shangai» is a 1947 film written, directed and played by Orson Welles. 
MICHAEL (Orson Welles - voice over from the film) That's what Grisby thought. But, of course, she meant to kill Grisby, too. After he'd served his purpose. Poor howling idiot. 
Larry has now reached the backstage. He is behind the screen, a small part of which is seen on the side of the shot. 
MICHAEL (Orson Welles - voice over from the film) He never even did that. He went and shot Broome. And that was not part of the plan. Broome might have got to the police before he died. 
Larry walks around the backstage, trying to find his way. We see the black and white film on the screen, but also reflections of the screen on the multiple mirrors scattered around the backstage. 
MICHAEL (Orson Welles - voice over from the film) And if the cops traced it to Grisby... and the cops made Grisby talk, he'd spill everything. 
Medium shot on the staircase. Paul is walking very slowly downstairs. 
MICHAEL (Orson Welles - voice over from the film) And she'd be finished, so she had to shut up Grisby but quick. Back on Larry, still trying to find his way around the backstage. 
MICHAEL (Orson Welles - voice over from the film) And I was the fall guy. 
Full shot on the screen, where a man is falling down a long slide, like the one used by kids on playgrounds. We hear the film music. 
Medium close shot on two mirrors, one behind the other. On the mirrors, we see the reflection of the screen. Paul is slowly walking from behind the first mirror, his gun in hand. 
Full shot on the mirrors, with Larry walking cautiously among them. 
PAUL'S MOVIE HOUSE - OLD DRESSING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY 
Medium shot on Carol in the small room. She is still trying to get free from her bonds and gag. 
ELSA (Rita Hayworth - voice over from the film) Why don't you try to understand ? PAUL'S MOVIE HOUSE - BACKSTAGE - INTERIOR DAY 
Back to the mirrors showing numerous reflections of the screen. 
ELSA (Rita Hayworth - voice over from the film) He was mad. He had to be shot. 
MICHAEL (Orson Welles - voice over from the film) And what about me ? 
Paul walks in, his gun in his hand. 
ELSA (Rita Hayworth - voice over from the film) We could have gone off together. 
Close shot of Larry half-hidden behind a large mirror. 
MICHAEL (Orson Welles - voice over from the film) One who follows his nature, keeps his original nature in the end. 
Larry inadvertently drops the large mirror on the floor. The mirror breaks with a crashing sound. 
CAROL (voice over) Help ! Help ! 
The camera pans to Paul, walking slowly with his gun pointed toward Larry. 
PAUL They can't see us behind the screen, and they can't hear us with the sound on. Not even a gunshot. 
Behind Paul, we see the film on the screen. We have now reached the famous last scene of the film, shot in the hall of mirrors. Rita Hayworth's face is reflected on the many mirrors in the film, just like, in the actual scene in the backstage, Paul and Larry are reflected on the many mirrors scattered around. 
ARTHUR (Everett Sloane - voice over from the film) I knew I'd find you two together. 
Arthur's figure, walking with a cane, is reflected in the many mirrors in the film. Just the same, Gladys, who has just entered the backstage, walking with a cane, is also reflected on the mirrors scattered around her. She has a gun in the hand which is not holding the cane. 
While Gladys and Paul are talking, the film keeps on showing on the screen behind them, but we do not understand the words from the film, because Paul and Gladys' voices are louder. 
GLADYS Hallo, Paul. Didn't you expect me ? 
Medium shot on the mirrors, showing several reflections of Paul. 
PAUL Mrs. Dalton. 
Close shot on Gladys' face. While she is talking, the camera pans away from her, showing her reflection on a mirror. 
GLADYS You made a lot of promises to me, over the years. And then, you decided to dump me for that young model. 
The camera keeps on panning, showing another reflection of Gladys. 
PAUL (voice over) I never led you on. 
GLADYS (with a very harsh voice) It's late for excuses. 
Medium shot on the mirrors showing several reflections of Paul. 
PAUL None of you can prove anything. 
Full shot of the screen, showing Arthur and his numerous reflections on the mirrors in the film. 
ARTHUR (Everett Sloane - voice over from the film) So you'd be foolish to fire that gun. 
Low angle shot on the staircase, showing Larry going down the stairs. 
ARTHUR (Everett Sloane - voice over from the film) With these mirrors, it's difficult to tell. You are aiming at me, aren't you ? 
LARRY Carol ? Carol ? Carol ? Medium shot of Gladys and one of her reflections. 
GLADYS I'm aiming at you, lover. 
ARTHUR (Everett Sloane - voice over from the film) Of course, killing you is killing myself. 
GLADYS Of course, killing you is killing myself. 
ARTHUR (Everett Sloane - voice over from the film) It's the same thing. 
GLADYS But you know, I'm pretty tired of both of us. 
She fired her gun twice 
Medium shot on the many reflections of Paul. He fires his gun twice. We hear noises of mirrors being broken by the gunshots, both in the film, and on the backstage itself. Medium shot of Gladys and one of her reflections. She turns around, not being sure, because of the mirrors, of Paul's exact location. 
Medium shot of Paul walking on the backstage. We still hears noises of mirrors being broken, but we don't know if the noises come from the film or the backstage. 
Medium shot of Gladys and several of the reflections. 
Medium shot of the floor of the backstage. We see the bottom of the screen and, of course, the film projected on it, and in which the mirrors are being broken. Paul enters from behind a mirror frame, and falls on the floor. Gladys' reflection appears in several mirrors. She stops and looks at Paul's body lying on the floor. 
PAUL'S MOVIE HOUSE - OLD DRESSING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY 
Medium close shot of Larry entering the room. He rushes to Carol, and takes her gag off. 
LARRY God ! Are you okay ? Are you okay ? 
He hugs and kisses her. 
CAROL Oh, God, Larry ! Oh, Larry, I'm so happy to see you ! 
LARRY Jesus, I was, I was never so glad to see somebody in my life. Are you all right ? 
He starts untying her hands. 
CAROL Yes, I'm all right. 
LARRY You don't know what's going on out there. I'll never say that life doesn't imitate art again. I'm... I'm... Oh, gee... 
CAROL We... we gotta call the police, Larry. 
LARRY Yes, and... and... and... a glazier. 
CAROL I know. Oh, God. 
LARRY Quick, quick. Dial, dial, dial. 
He picks up the telephone, and Carol, whose hands are now completely free, starts dialing. CAROL Larry. Oh, God, Larry. Oh, God. Oh, honey. Oh, God. Ow ! Ow ! Oh, God ! Jesus ! 
Larry hugs and kisses her again.

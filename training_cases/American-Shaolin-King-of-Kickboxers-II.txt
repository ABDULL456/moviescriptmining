FADE IN: EXT. NEW YORK CITY SKYLINE ­ NIGHT ESTABLISHING SHOT OF THE NEW YORK CITY SKYLINE AT NIGHT, THE LIGHTS OF THE CITY SHINING BRIGHTLY. EXT. WORKOUT AREA ­ SAME NIGHT ESTABLISHING SHOT OF MASTER KWAN'S SCHOOL, A RAMSHACKLE BUILDING IN A BURNED OUT ROW OF STORES. His is the only one still    occupied, and it doesn't look that permanent. In the window    is a cardboard, handwritten sign that reads "Kwan's Shaolin Kung Fu".    What remains visible behind the poster and the security grate is an    IMPRESSION of people moving and milling around. INT. WORKOUT AREA ­ SAME NIGHT 
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF KWAN'S SHAOLIN KUNG FU SCHOOL. 
The students are doing their own thing, and they are a mixture of old and young, men and women. They are not dressed alike, as they would be in a Karate school: they are dressed in old T-shirts and tattered sweat pants. This is not a wealthy school, by any means, and that is typified by the appearance of SIFU KWAN, who is walking through the students as they train. He is wizened old man, 70 years old if he is a day, and he is dressed in a fraying Chinese jacket, scruffy cloth shoes and a discolored Chinese T-shirt. 
ANGLE ON A YOUNG ADULT 
Struggling through a horse stance, his face in real pain. He is trying his best to hold the stance, but his legs are quivering. He drops out of the stance onto his knees. Master Kwan is right beside him. 
YOUNG ADULT 
Sifu Kwan, was that long enough? It's been 10 minutes... 
Sifu Kwan shakes his head and puts his hands behind his back as he walks past the student. KWAN At Shaolin Temple, in misty Songshan mountains, We monks trained in iron palm until our hands bled... (beat) 
... then we trained some more. He walks on, leaving a puzzled student behind. YOUNG ADULT (getting back into horse stance) I guess not... 
ANGLE ON KWAN As he walks around the different people training. As one woman is moving through an intricate series of movements, he sighs and rearranges her hands. KWAN Tiger grasps his tail, not hamburger! He    moves on, studying the room with his eyes, often glancing toward the    door, and then toward the small clock on a table near the door. It    is late, and Kwan is obviously waiting for someone to arrive. As he    is waiting, a young STUDENT comes up to Kwan. STUDENT Master Kwan, when can I learn flying kicks? I see Bruce Lee... 
KWAN 
Bruce Lee actor, we fighters, warriors. A sparrow in flight is beautiful, but a side kick to the ribs is effective. Show me. 
The boy shrugs    and then    starts throwing side kicks. Kwan   is half looking at the    boy and    half looking towards the door and   the clock. The boy throws    three or    four kicks and then stops. He is   watching Kwan watching    the door.    Kwan sees him, and turns back to   him. 
KWAN (CONT'D) 
(shaking his head) 
A Shaolin warrior lets nothing intrude. Continue, never mind. 
He continues to kick, and Kwan continues to look at the door. Finally, the student stops kicking, half-heartedly bows to the master, and then moves to the side of the workout room. Kwan doesn't know he's gone. Kwan turns around, forgetting for a moment what he is doing, and comes face to face with the mother of a student, MRS. RODRIGUEZ, and she is holding a uniform of some sort. She smiles widely at him and holds up the uniform. It is beautiful, obviously hand made, and on the back is embroidered: "Kwan's Shaolin" and underneath that is "Drew Carson". Kwan takes in the entire outfit, while the rest of the class is gathering around to have a look. They are all very impressed. 
KWAN (CONT'D) Never in my days at the Shaolin Temple have I seen uniform as beautiful as this. Thank you, Mrs. Rodriguez. I wish Drew were here to thank you himself. Ta ma de! This last he says looking at the empty door. MOTHER 
I only hope it brings him luck in the tournament. 
KWAN Luck is no concern, Mrs. Rodriguez. Shaolin warriors depend on heart and soul ­ that's how they saved the T'ang emporer. He looks again at the door, then claps his hands together, gathering his students around him. KWAN (CONT'D) Xie Xie, Mrs. Rodriguez. (to class) During my time training at the Shaolin Temple, the birthplace of the martial arts, I was lucky (glance at Mrs. Rodriguez)... er... fortunate to have the best instructors in the world train me. But, there was also time for individual training ­ where skills were honed like the blade of a sword. Now, it is that time for you. 
He turns to go. 
One of the students, before he can leave, clears his throat. 
STUDENT 2 
What do you want us to do? 
KWAN 
When the blind follow the blind, they both fall over the cliff. Understand? 
STUDENT 2 
No. 
The others mutter "No" and shake their heads, confused. 
KWAN 
No matter. He exits, leaving his students staring vacantly after him. 
They look at each other, honestly not knowing what to do. EXT. DREW GARAGE ­ SAME NIGHT ESTABLISHING SHOT OF OLD GARAGE. 
It is kind of spooky, and there are no lights on outside. There is candlelight inside, and it is moving around ­ an effect not unlike a ghost carrying a candelabra. 
INT. DREW GARAGE ­ SAME NIGHT ESTABLISHING SHOT OF INTERIOR. The area is dilapidated, but very clean, with all kinds of kung fu and Chinese paraphenalia lying around. Around the corner comes the spooky light, and (with music building to a crescendo), we see DREW 
CARSON, a    muscular 16/17 year old, bowls of flaming wax on his bare shoulders,    moving through the garage, practicing his kung fu maneuvers.    He is kicking, punching, etc., occasionally spilling hot wax on his    skin (INSERT). In the background is a TV, and on it is showing a martial arts movie. ANGLE ON KWAN Who is quietly settling into a shadowy corner of the garage, watching Drew. ANGLE ON DREW As he continues to move around the workout area, his arms and body moving as he tries to match the movements on the TV. Suddenly, Kwan jumps out of the shadows, attacking. Drew reacts instantly, evading the attack, the wax sloshing around in the bowls but not spilling (INSERT SHOT HERE). Kwan continues the attack, and Drew evades, their movements matching the movements on the TV almost move for move. It is a beautiful ballet, and Drew ends it by sweeping Kwan down to the ground. When Kwan hits the ground, hard, his face is lit by the TV screen. 
The grounds are immaculate and huge, exquisitely kept and beautifully laid out. A gathering is around the pool and lawn area, where TREVOR and his team are having an exhibition for their guests. Polite applause is COMING FROM THE CROWD, ALL WELL-DRESSED AND OBVIOUSLY WELL-HEELED. 
ANGLE ON TREVOR As he knocks out an opponent. ANGLE ON CROWD Applauding. ANGLE ON TREVOR Taunting a different opponent. Trevor executes a beautiful technique and puts the guy down and out. ANGLE ON TEAM (Psychologist, therapist, masseur, etc.) who are cheering Trevor on. ANGLE ON TREVOR As he plays with the next fighter. 
TREVOR 
They said you were good... ha! 
He knocks the guy out with a picture perfect kick. There is no denying that he's a superior fighter. 
TREVOR (CONT'D) 
Can't you get me any quality sparring partners? 
The next guy comes up, but before they can start, the psychologist, DR. PFEELGUT, calls for "Time" and motions Trevor over. 
PFEELGUT 
It's    not enough just to win, Trevor. You have to destroy your    opponent completely, mentally and physically. Beat him    once, he's a threat. Humiliate him, and he'll fear you    forever. 
Trevor listens to this, nods his head once, and when Pfeelgut goes to leave, Trevor pushes him into the pool. Pfeelgut comes to the surface, smiling. PFEELGUT (CONT'D) Exactly! Trevor goes back to the ring. He really takes it      to this guy, alternately playing with him and hurting him. As      the guy tries to hold his own, the string to his pants comes loose      and they start to fall down. He grabs for them with both hands, and      Trevor starts to back up, laughing with the rest of the group. 
ANGLE ON PFEELGUT Toweling off, who is yelling to Trevor. PFEELGUT (CONT'D) 
GET HIM! NOW!! Trevor looks at him for a moment, not really understanding, then sees what the psychologist is saying. He lunges immediately forward and (in SLOW MOTION) knocks the guy out while he is still trying to pull his pants up. ANGLE ON CROWD AS THEY ENJOY THE SHOW IMMENSELY Trevor has learned the lesson of the day, and he walks off. INT. TREVOR HOUSE ­ SAME DAY ESTABLISHING SHOT OF TREVOR BEING PAMPERED BY HIS ENTOURAGE The masseur is massaging his shoulders, a woman is doing a pedicure and another is doing a manicure. An exercise physiologist is going over a computer print out with Trevor, when an old Korean master, MASTER KIM, comes into the room. 
TREVOR 
Ah, Master Kim. 
(to physiologist) 
I'll look at these stats later. 
Trevor indicates a seat near him, much lower than the one he is sitting in. The Korean master prefers to remain standing. 
TREVOR (CONT'D) 
Are all you guys named Kim? So, what did you think? 
KIM 
(thick accent) 
You velly good fighter... 
TREVOR (CONT'D) Learn English, will ya? And, tell me something I don't know... KIM 
A mountain lion doesn't ponder his weakness, and is therefore vulnerable. TREVOR (after a beat) 
Well, I'm pretty damn tired of this fortune cookie crap. (beat) You're history. Chaunce, get ride of the bum. 
The butler, CHAUNCY, comes forward and walks up to Master Kim. 
CHAUNCY Very good, sir. TREVOR Don't come here any more, you hear? Over a little more to the left, Sam. The masseur nods and adjusts his technique accordingly. TREVOR (CONT'D) It's hard being me, you know. So much pressure... EXT. COLISEUM ­ DAY People are streaming into the large building. The marquee out front reads "Diamond Nationals". 
INT. COLISEUM ­ SAME DAY 
ESTABLISHING MONTAGE OF TOURNAMENT: CROWDS AND COMPETITORS. 
(SOME IDEAS, NOT IN ORDER) 
Competitors warming up (wall front stretch, very high; one guy kicking another in the head ­ tap, tap, tap; two man routine practicing ­ another one jumps in?; two beautiful girls sparring; crowd assembling; group of kids waiting ­ call comes over public address system, they run off; stand outside selling high tech equipment; different styles of fighter's clothes ­ camo, stars & stripes, "headhunter"; stern 9 year old girl doing kata; two toddlers barely seen through their safety equipment fighting furiously; two twins doing identical kata; breaking; etc.) 
ANGLE ON DREW AND KWAN 
Walk into the area ­ Drew is dressed in the ill-fitting handmade suit by Mrs. Rodriguez. People recognize him as he walks past. 
ANGLE ON TREVOR Making his entrance. He is in a perfectly laundered and pressed suit, and his assistant is carrying another suit pressed and ready to go. COMPETITOR 
China. DREW You mean... all the stories...? KWAN (nodding) Made up. I never trained at the Shaolin Temple. When I realized my dream couldn't come true, I convinced myself that it had anyway. It was a small step to convince other people. DREW Why are you telling me this? KWAN 
I've given you all I can, and it's not enough. It was never enough. You're like a son to me, Drew, and you have all the potential in the world, but I can't take you where you want to go. 
Kwan takes the needle out of Drew's arm, and then rubs the spot where it was with a cotton ball. 
KWAN (CONT'D) 
There, that should control the swelling. 
He watches Drew, who is pondering what Kwan has said. 
DREW 
So you're not a Shaolin? 
KWAN 
No. 
DREW Never were? 
KWAN No. Drew nods, an idea forming in his head. A slight smile forms on his face. Kwan was expecting him to be angry, he never expected this. 
KWAN (CONT'D) What? DREW 
If you are not a Shaolin warrior, then I will become one. KWAN 
What are you talking about? DREW I'm going to the Shaolin Temple ­ they can train me so I will never lose like that again. Kwan feels Drew's forehead. A long beat here as Kwan studies Drew's eyes. KWAN He hit you so hard, you're delirious. I'll get a cold cloth. He starts to get up, but Drew grabs his arm and forces him back down. DREW (eyes intent) 
Don't you    see? You said    yourself I needed the right training ­    where better    than the Shaolin Temple? What's holding me    here? I have    the chance to do what you couldn't.    I will go to    the Shaolin Temple. 
Kwan looks at him, realizes he's serious. He nods his head, giving the idea serious consideration. He smiles along with Drew. 
KWAN 
I must pay for your ticket... 
DREW 
No! I'll make it there myself. 
KWAN 
I grew up on the stories of the Shaolin, and you can be those stories. You can live my dream for me ­ at least let me help you. Let an old man make up for the trouble he's caused. Kwan touches Drew's bruised cheek, fatherly love in his eyes. Drew nods his head, then bows in the traditional Chinese manner. DREW Master... MONTAGE OF DEPARTURE ANGLE ON DREW AND KWAN AS KWAN HANDS HIM A "NORTHWEST AIRLINES" TICKET. ANGLE ON DREW 
As he packs for China. ANGLE ON KWAN AND DREW As Kwan drops drew off at the AIRPORT. Drew takes his suitcase and 
walks into the airport. EXT. CHANG AN LU ­ DAY ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW RUNNING ALONG BEIJING'S CHANG AN LU, A SEA OF BICYCLES AROUND HIM. Bicycle bells ring loudly as figures dressed in the same drab clothes ride around him, their faces covered with scarves and surgical masks against the northern China dirt. CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL TIAN AN MEN SQUARE and the huge photo of CHAIRMAN MAO on the front of the Meridian Gate of the Forbidden City. Drew continues his run, past a group of western-dressed lyou mang, who watch him run by through dark glasses. Drew runs through a large city park, stopping to watch a group of older citizens going through Tai Zhi routines under the weeping willow trees there. 
Drew runs through an open air food market, picking his way through flipping fish, dead frogs and all kinds of fruits and vegetables. People yell at each other, trying to get the best price. Young man brushing his teeth in the street. A group of toddlers, strung together with rope, walks down the street, their split pants showing glimpses of bare bottoms as they walk. 
EXT. TRAIN STATION ­ SAME DAY 
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF SERIOUSLY OVERCROWDED TRAIN, PEOPLE PUSHING AND SHOVING TO GET ON. 
Drew walks up to it, a huge backpack on his back. He hesitates a moment, then starts forcing his way onto the train like everyone else. He manages to get in through a window. 
INT. CROWDED TRAIN ­ SAME DAY 
There are no seats. Drew takes his pack off and sits on it. 
Next to him is an old man, his teeth red and rotted from betel nut juice. The man smiles at Drew. EXT. CHINA COUNTRYSIDE ­ DAY

INT. LUOYANG TRAIN STATION ­ DAY ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW GETTING OFF THE TRAIN. He stops on the platform for a moment, a huge colorful Chinese billboard in the b.g. A transit cop quickly comes up to him and prods him into motion. Drew walks on, passing a sign that reads "Luoyang". EXT. CHINESE STREETS ­ DAY ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW MAKING HIS WAY TOWARD THE SHAOLIN TEMPLE. He stops at    a drink stand and orders one. As soon as he stops, he is ringed with    people watching his every move ­ he feels almost like a movie star.    The woman in the stand hands him a drink, and takes the money out of    his hand. DREW Where is the Shaolin Temple? Shaolin? 
The woman just smiles and shakes her head, not comprehending. 
DREW 
I'm camping out. 
He starts away from the stand. 
DREW (CONT'D) 
In front of the temple. 
He walks off into the Chinese night. 
EXT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE ­ EARLY MORN 
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF MIST-LADEN COURTYARD. 
The sun is barely coming up, and only a few shafts of light are illuminating the darkness. A figure can be seen sitting cross-legged in front of the door. 
It is Drew, backpack at his side. The front door opens and a monk pokes his head out to look around, and he sees Drew sitting there. His eyes widen in shock, then he quickly disappears inside. Almost immediately, the door opens again, and the Admissions Monk is standing there, surprised and angry to see Drew sitting there. ADMISSIONS MONK 
Go home! You cannot stay here! No response from Drew. He just sits there, staring straight ahead. ADMISSIONS MONK (CONT'D) 
Do you hear me? Go away! Drew doesn't move. San De, the sweeping monk, walks out of the open door, a monk behind 
him carrying a suitcase. He walks past Drew, noticing him sitting there. He walks on. The Admissions Monk slams the door, angry. EXT. TEMPLE ­ MONTAGE SECTION ANGLE ON DREW SWEATING IN THE HOT SUNSHINE Sweat is running into Drew's eyes, and he is trying to keep them from stinging. ANGLE ON DREW BEING TORMENTED BY LOCAL KIDS They are playing games around him, throwing stones at him, messing with his hair and his clothes, touching the things in his backpack (frisbee, football, walkman), etc. ANGLE ON DRILL SERGEANT 
As he comes out of the temple, chasing away the kids. 
When they are gone, he turns to Drew. 
DRILL SERGEANT 
Will you give up? I think so. 
ANGLE ON DREW SHIVERING IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT 
His eyes are closed, and it is obvious he is very uncomfortable. 
ANGLE ON SPIDER AS IT CRAWLS OUT TO SEE DREW 
It lingers for a moment, then goes away. 
ANGLE ON DREW BEING FED BY ASHEMA 
She is giving him food, and all he is moving is his mouth. They do not speak. 
ANGLE ON DREW SITTING IN THE RAIN 
He is miserable, and he is looking at the relative comfort of the stands around the temple, where there is food, warmth and light. His spirit is wavering. 
ANGLE ON DREW BEING FED BY ASHEMA AGAIN ASHEMA Give this up, Drew! Please? 
No response from Drew. Just a small smile. ANGLE ON SPIDER, WHO IS BACK This time it stays even longer. Drew looks down at it and smiles. ANGLE ON MONKS FROM TEMPLE Looking out the windows at the crazy foreigner in their courtyard. 
ANGLE ON DREW IN COURTYARD As a school group comes through the temple. The children are tied together with a rope, and the teacher motions to the crazy American. Drew has become an attraction! ANGLE ON DREW, SURROUNDED BY OLD MEN They are marveling at his perserverance. ANGLE ON DREW, WIND AND RAIN This time it doesn't seem to bother him so much. ANGLE ON DREW WITH ASHEMA AND HER BAU BAU THERE Bau Bau speaks quickly in Chinese. ASHEMA (CONT'D) 
My Bau Bau says, keep it up! He is proud of you... 
Drew nods. 
ANGLE ON DREW SURROUNDED BY KIDS 
They are no longer tormenting him, they are playing around and with him. Drew is not moving, but he is part of their group. 
ANGLE ON DREW, THE SPIDER NOW SITTING ON HIS HAND 
Drew stares at the spider, his companion in the vigil. 
ANGLE ON DREW, BIRDS ALL AROUND HIM 
The line of disciples has stopped, waiting for Drew. Drew, back pack in hand, takes his place at the end of the line. 
They parade past a line of monks assembled in the courtyard inside the temple. 
As they walk by, some of the monks look nonplused, while a few are put out by the fact that Drew is among them. 
Several of the disciples turn around to look at Drew, and a couple are openly hostile to him. 
They file up to a raised platform, on which stand 20 monks, each holding a scroll in their hands, one monk for every new disciple. 
A gong sounds, and the questions begin. 
ANGLE ON FIRST DISCIPLE Who is asked... 
MONK Do you accept the authority of the Shaolin patriarchs? DISCIPLE 1 
Yes, without pause. ANGLE ON DREW MONK Do you renounce the earthly world? DREW 
Sure do, master. You bet. 
The monk pauses, for that is not the ritual answer to the question. The Drill Sergeant comes up to him and whispers in his ear, and the monk then continues. MONK Will you abide by the rules of the temple, even if it means death? DREW I do. The Drill Sergeant comes up behind Drew and WHACKS him in the side with his elbow. DRILL SERGEANT (whispering) 
Answer "Yes, without pause." 
DREW 
(rubbing his side) 
Yes, without pause. 
ANGLE ON ANOTHER DISCIPLE 
MONK 
Who is the patriarch of the Shaolin Temple? 
DISCIPLE 2 
Bodhidharma. 
ANGLE ON DREW 
MONK 
Do you accept the shr fu at the Shaolin Temple as your spiritual leaders? DREW Yes, without pause. The Drill Sergeant nods his head. MONK 
Will a fighting monk ever use his skills for personal gain? 
Drew pauses, looking at the Drill Sergeant. The D.S. nods, urging him on. DREW Yes, without pause. 
The D.S. puts his hands over his eyes. DREW (CONT'D) I mean, no, of course not. Then, another gong sounds, and the quizzing is concluded. A figure moves down a corridor in beautiful robes. Everyone bows down, their eyes on the floor, to the figure, who is moving towards the raised platform in the center. Drew, also bowed down, sneaks a peak at the figure. It is San De! San De catches his eye and smiles slightly. He winks at Drew, then clears his throat. Everyone stands up again. 
SAN DE 
Do these disciples accept the authority of the Shaolin Temple? 
DRILL SERGEANT 
Yes, without pause, Master San De. 
ANGLE ON DREW 
Who now knows that the monk he called a "Janitor" is the headmaster! 
DREW 
(under his breath) 
I'll be damned! 
INT. DORM ­ NIGHT 
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF THEIR SLEEPING QUARTERS, AS THE MONKS FILE IN, LED BY THE D.S. 
A number of cots are lined up side by side. The D.S. has assigned a bed to each monk. Drew finds his bed, which is right next to Gao's. 
GAO 
I want another bed. 
D.S. 
Why? 
GAO (CONT'D) 
I won't sleep next to the American. D.S. We are no longer Chinese or Americans, Han or Mongol. We are Shaolin. Everyone is a monk. GAO (CONT'D) 
Well, this monk smells! Drew unconsciously smells himself. He shakes his head. Li goes up to the D.S. and points to the bed he was assigned. LI I will switch with Disciple Gao. 
D.S. nods, and then starts for the door. D.S. Go to sleep. No talking! We have an early day of training tomorrow. Gao collects his stuff and starts off to the new bed, hitting Drew with his shoulder. Drew trips him as he walks away, all done very secretively since the D.S. is watching. DREW Jerk! Li comes over to the new bed, and in silence they get climb into their respective beds. D.S. switches off the lights, then leaves, and Drew stares up at the ceiling. DREW (CONT'D) 
Thanks for what you did. 
LI 
Where are you from? 
DREW 
New York City. You? 
LI 
Beijing. What is New York like? 
DREW 
Amazing. I'll tell you about... 
GAO 
Shut UP! 
DREW Blow me! 
Drew waits for a moment, fearful that the D.S. will be coming back in. He doesn't. DREW (CONT'D) Good night, Li. 
LI Wan an. DISSOLVE TO: 
ANGLE ON DREW, SLEEPING All is quiet. 
Suddenly, a huge stick ENTERS FRAME, and it pauses for a moment above Drew, before THUMPING down on top of him. Drew cries out when he is hit, and jumps out of bed, looking all around him. No one is there. A few of the disciples are moving around because he yelled, but there is nothing else there. Drew, belatedly, gets into a fighting stance, but no other attack is coming. ANGLE ON GAO Who seems to be sleeping peacefully. ANGLE ON DREW As he climbs back into bed, bone-weary. He lies back down to sleep. INT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE ­ MORNING 
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF LATRINE. 
Drew stumbles in, bleary-eyed,    to relieve himself. He stands at the urinal, relaxing as he starts.    Suddenly, a huge stick WHACKS Drew across the rear end, the SOUND    reverberating through the latrine. Drew yelps and jumps, looking    around for the attacker. 
No one is there, and his underwear is now all wet. 
INT. DINING ROOM ­ SAME DAY 
ESTABLISHING TIGHT SHOT OF RICE GRUEL ("WATER RICE"), A SPOON STIRRING THE MEAGER MIXTURE. 
CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL Drew sitting with Li and some other disciples. 
Drew makes a face. 
DREW 
Any problems? 
Drew shakes his head and starts to eat, quickly. 
ANGLE ON DREW 
As he loads up a two baskets of dirt onto his pole. He gets it up onto his shoulders, in pain, and starts to walk. Immediately, the D.S. is there in front of him. 
He examines the baskets. They are not full. He moves quickly and dumps both baskets of dirt. 
DREW (shocked) What'd you do that for? D.S. Do a job well or don't do it. 
ANGLE ON GAO AND THE DISCIPLES As they are in line for water. They each drink a large glass full, then move back to their work area. Drew is the last in line. When Drew gets to the front, the D.S. smiles and shakes his head. 
D.S. Sorry, all gone. Get some more. Drew stares at all the water spilled onto the ground, then looks up at the D.S., then forces a smile. He takes the proferred buckets of water (made of wood, with pointed bottoms and large handles). The D.S. indicates that they are to be held straight out to the sides, to work on the shoulder muscles. Drew turns and walks away, muttering to himself. DREW (CONT'D) I'm gonna get you, man. Oh, yeah... Gao is laughing as he watches Drew go. EXT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE ­ SAME DAY ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW FILLING THE BUCKETS IN THE STREAM. 
Once they are filled, he starts back for the temple. His shoulders are straining from the weight of the buckets. 
He goes over the path to the temple, having to negotiate logs over chasms, etc. After various trials and tribulations, Drew arrives at the temple, his arms incredibly tired. The D.S. is there waiting for him. 
Drew, determined not to show any weakness, raises the buckets a little bit higher. He comes to the D.S., proud and defiant. The D.S. motions for him to put the buckets down. 
Without thinking, Drew, puts the buckets down, and they both fall over, spilling their contents onto the ground. Drew tries to stop them, but he's too late. The water has all spilled out onto the ground. 
DREW 
Don't tell me, I know. Get more water... 
INT. DORM ROOM ­ NIGHT 
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DISCIPLES ALL IN BED. They are exhausted from their work. Drew is lying in bed, his eyes wide open, ready to get attacked. ANGLE ON DREW 
As his eyes go closed, finally. EXT. WORK AREA ­ DAY ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW WALKING ON A RIDGE BETWEEN TWO LARGE HOLES, CARRYING HUGE BASKETS OF DIRT ON HIS POLE. He is balancing as he walks. ANGLE ON GAO Who is working at the other end. He starts across the same ridge. 
They come to the middle: a stand off. GAO Back up and let me pass. DREW No chance, Gao. You back up. Gao smiles and shakes   his head. Gao starts forward, and WHACKS Drew in the leg with a leg   sweep. Drew tries to keep his balance, and fights a valient, but   losing battle. He falls over the side, the dirt in his buckets flying   everywhere. Gao wipes his hands off and continues walking. CLOSEUP ON DREW'S BLOODY HAND A huge splinter sticking out of it. He is in real pain. The D.S. walks over and looks at the splinter, and in one move pulls it out. 
D.S. 
(heartlessly) 
Shaolin monks feel no pain. Rub some dirt on it and you will be fine. 
He walks away. 
ANGLE ON DREW AND THE DISCIPLES 
On a work break. They are watching the monks training in the distance. It is all the more desirable because it is unattainable. 
In the distance, a monk can be seen walking between two other monks. They are leading him out. 
The monk continues walking until he walks right in front of the disciples. His face and body are covered with bruises and welts. The two other monks don't say a word, their faces grim. 
Li turns to the D.S. LI 
What happened? D.S. He failed to pass through the wooden man chamber. He must leave the temple. The D.S. walks off. LI (CONT'D) The "Wooden Man Chamber"! The ultimate test of a Shaolin monk... WU 
Did you see his face? 
SHU Poor guy. GAO He just wasn't good enough. I wouldn't be surprised if half of us go out the same way. The D.S. appears and motions for them to work. INT. MEDITATION HALL ­ DAY ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DISCIPLES, DREW IN THE MIDDLE, SITTING IN ROWS IN THE INCENSE-FILLED MEDITATION CHAMBER. The monk in charge of the chamber is talking to them.

INT. DORM AREA ­ NIGHT 
ANGLE ON DREW 
Who is holding court. 
DREW 
We came here to train, not to be slaves! We're free men... 
MU But we swore to obey them... DREW 
An uninformed choice is no choice at all! MU Huh? 
DREW We have to stand up for our rights! If they don't even know we're dissatisfied, things will never change. GAO 
They haven't changed for centuries, why should we listen to you? DREW Are we men or mice? Sheep or the shepherd? WU I'm with you! The others are with him too, except for Gao. They are ready to explode, and Drew has the match. DREW I'm for going to the Headmaster right now! They are all ready. They head for the door, but Gao doesn't move. Drew stops at the door and turns to Gao.

INT. SHAOLIN HALLWAY ­ SAME NIGHT 
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF GROUP ASSEMBLED OUTSIDE SAN DE'S CHAMBERS. 
Drew goes to knock on the door, when it opens and San De is standing there. The D.S. has just arrived. He looks at San De for instructions, but San De indicates that he will deal with them. 
DREW Master San De! SAN DE 
Who else? DREW We have something to say... 
SAN DE This is an interesting coincidence, as I was just on my way to your sleeping quarters to talk with you all. DREW 
I request permission to go first. SAN DE I think I'd better... DREW No, really, I want to... San De holds up his hand. He is the final authority. SAN DE Here at the temple,    we use a period of intense physical labor to test your    patience, and to teach you humility and self-reliance.    As you continue training, you will be given chores every    day ­ remember the first time you saw me I was sweeping?    Physical labor keeps us humble. 
ANGLE ON THE DISCIPLES 
Who tonight have been anything but humble. 
SAN DE (CONT'D) 
You've all performed    admirably, and have learned an important lesson ­ to    obey your shr fu without question. Because of this, I've    decided to begin your martial training sooner than    what is prescribed. Tomorrow morning. 
The disciples can hardly believe their luck. 
SAN DE (CONT'D) 
And, what did you have to say to me? 
ANGLE ON DREW 
Who is sputtering now. 
DREW 
ANGLE ON MONK ON A SET OF POLES He is going through a complex form, kicking and punching, never missing or faltering a step. Some of the poles are as high as 6 feet off the ground. ANGLE ON GAO ON THE POLES He is less sure, but at least he doesn't fall. 
ANGLE ON DREW Trying the poles. He starts out well, but he soon misses and falls, almost impaling himself on a pole. DREW I can't do this! D.S. Here at Shaolin, can't doesn't exist. Only won't. EXT. TRAINING AREA ­ DAY ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DISCIPLES PAIRED OFF. Drew is working with his friend Li. They are moving through a series of techniques, ending with a flashy kicking technique which is to blocked by a special Shaolin technique. 
Each time Li throws the final kick, Drew gets hit, HARD. 
His block isn't working. A monk comes up to him. 
MONK 
Block the way I showed you. 
DREW 
(showing him a block) 
This is the way I was taught. 
MONK (CONT'D) 
Do it this way. You won't get hit. 
Drew bows and turns to continue working with Li. By this time, however, the ranks have shifted, and Gao is opposite Drew. 
Drew attacks first in the series, and Gao uses the block to easily deflect Drew's kick. GAO (menacingly) My turn. He attacks, and Drew gets to the final technique. He blocks the way he did before, and he gets slammed brutally by Gao. Gao stands over him, smiling. 
EXT. TRAINING AREA ­ DAY ESTABLISHING SHOT OF MONKS FLIPPING THROUGH THE AIR, DOING FLYING KICKS, AERIALS, ETC. A monk is alternately falling down and kipping up, falling down and 
kipping up. Drew's group is working on several very athletic maneuvers, none of which Drew is especially good at. Gao, of course, is having no trouble. Drew tries a flying move and falls into a heap on the ground. He is very angry, and he hits the ground with his fist. MONK Emotions cloud the spirit ­ eliminate them. DREW This isn't martial arts ­ it's gymnastics! MONK This is Shaolin Wu Shu. Continue. 
Drew sits in the dirt, watching everyone around him sail through the air and flip over the ground. He is not a happy camper. 
EXT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE ­ DAY 
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF TRAINING AREA. 
The entire group is gathered in a sort of pit, on a hard concrete floor. D.S. stands in the middle. 
D.S. 
I want to go over some takedowns before we end for the day. I'll need a partner... 
He scans the group, and then points to Drew. Drew smiles ruefully, walks to the front and bows to D.S. 
D.S. 
Watch carefully as I take him down, using techniques from shwai jyau, Chinese wrestling. 
DREW (looking at ground) Excuse me, Master, but there aren't any mats here. D.S. Do they always use mats in America? 
The group laughs a little at that, and Drew's manhood is now challenged. 
D.S. (CONT'D) If you are scared, I'll get someone else. Perhaps Gao would assist me... ANGLE ON GAO 
Who is already getting up, ready and willing. This changes Drew's mind right away. ANGLE ON DREW AND D.S. DREW Let's do it. D.S. Attack me straight on... Drew attacks, and is taken down brutally, smashed into the hard concrete floor. No attempt is made to cushion or soften the blow. Drew gets up right away, and attacks again. Again he is driven to the ground. This continues from all angles and all methods of attack. 
ANGLE ON THE GROUP 
Who can barely watch the destruction. 
ANGLE ON THE FIGHT 
The D.S. does not let up at all, taking 
Drew down hard each time. Every time, regardless of the impact, Drew gets right back up. His eyes are dazed, there is a little blood coming out of his nose, but he keeps coming back for more. 
Finally, after a high arcing back throw, a real thumper, the worst of all of them, the D.S. calls it a day. 
D.S. 
Drew shakes his head and gets back up. 
D.S. 
Switch! 
Now it's Drew's turn to strike, and he tries to hit Gao with the same amount of force as he did, but Gao avoids his attack, throwing him off balance. He throws another punch out, and Gao grabs it and pulls. 
Drew falls to the floor again. A monk who was watching walks over. 
MONK 
The goal of this drill is not to hurt your partner. Just try to tap his chest. 
DREW 
I know, but... 
MONK Then do it that way... The Monk walks away, shaking his head. 
EXT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE ­ EVENING ESTABLISHING SHOT OF TEMPLE COURTYARD, EMPTY EXCEPT FOR DREW AND LI PLAYING CATCH WITH A FRISBEE. Drew is flipping it in a bunch of different ways, and Li is enjoying watching him. To the side of the courtyard are two brooms leaning against the wall. 
DREW This sure beats sweeping... 
ANGLE ON FRISBEE Floating past temple statues and ancient Chinese decorations, barely missing them. Drew makes an acrobatic catch and then flicks it back to Li, harder than he should have. It heads for an ancient statue and smacks it dead center, right in the face. The statue starts to tip! Drew and Li rush for the statue and catch it, just before it tips over and smashes on the ground. They look at each other, thanking their lucky stars the statue didn't fall. They start to throw the frisbee again, when Drew spots the D.S. coming towards them. Drew stashes the frisbee in his shirt and grabs the brooms. 
He tosses one to Li and they just begin sweeping again when the D.S. rounds the corner. 
The D.S. knows something is going on, but they look so innocent. 
D.S. 
Sweep the main chamber, Drew. 
DREW (CONT'D) 
Yes, master. 
He bows and smiles goodbye to Li. He walks into the main training chamber. 
INT. CHAMBER ­ SAME EVENING 
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW WALKING INTO THE CHAMBER. 
This is the chamber where they had their first workout, and Drew just stands there for a moment, soaking up the tradition of it. 
He walks to an area of the chamber under the famous painting and stands staring at it. 
QUICK CUTS to different ANGLES of the painting. ANGLE ON DREW Who begins to sweep. 
His broom is going over the depressions where the monks train, and soon he loses his desire to sweep. He takes the broom in his hand as a weapon and starts to spin it, going through a martial arts form, his feet moving naturally into the depressions in the floor. He finishes with a flourish, having moved into a shadowy area in a corner, and then bows to an imaginary crowd, using the broom as a microphone. DREW 
(imitating an announcer) Presenting, the greatest fighter in the history of the Shaolin temple... Drew Carson! Drew holds his broom over his head, nodding his head to the imaginary crowd. DREW The crowd is going wild. Just then, out of the shadows comes an attacking staff, SLAMMING into Drew's unprotected stomach! Drew, ready to double over in pain, hears the staff hit the frisbee, and stands up straight, adjusting the frisbee that saved his stomach. Before he can react, the staff SMACKS him in the back of the head and sends him pitching to the floor. 
ANGLE ON DREW 
As he lands face down in the pile of dust and dirt he already swept up. 
EXT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE ­ EVENING 
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF TEMPLE COURTYARD, THE SUN SETTING IN THE DISTANCE. 
Drew is standing in front of a painting-statue of Bodhidharma, one in which he is made to look extremely fierce. 
San De walks up behind Drew and stands there for a moment. 
SAN DE 
He was an amazing monk... 
He bows to Bau Bau and then they walk off. 
They walk through the small town, checking it out. They walk through the countryside, enjoying their freedom. 
Drew has brought a frisbee with him, and they are tossing it around. EXT. LUOYANG CAVES ­ SAME DAY ESTABLISHING SHOT OF GROUP AS THEY WALK IN THE HILLS HOUSING THE FAMOUS LUO YANG CAVES. The hills are filled with Buddhist carvings. ANGLE ON CARVINGS ­ INTERCUT ANGLE ON DREW

As they walk by a riverside park. The park is filled with people, and a group of kids swinging into the river on a rope. Drew stops to watch them, then looks back at the others. They all shake their heads. Drew nods his. They continue to shake their heads. Drew starts running towards the kids, stripping off his shirt at the same time. The others pause for a moment, then follow his lead. ANGLE ON GROUP As they swing into the river, trying to keep their hats on as they splash into the water. they are having the time of their life. ANGLE ON GROUP 
Resting on the bank of the river. Drew and the guys spot a group of girls down the bank from them. 
DREW 
Check it out, guys! 
WU 
Girls! 
DREW 
Good work, Wu. What tipped you off? 
LI 
(alarmed) 
We are not allowed to have contact with females. It is the most serious rule of the temple. 
DREW 
It's a stupid rule, Li. But... He is about to turn away, then spots Ashema as she runs down a path to the group of girls. He stands up immediately and starts over to her. He is jogging, at the same time trying to straighten his clothes and his hat. Li starts running after Drew. The others follow. DREW (CONT'D) ASHEMA! 
ANGLE ON ASHEMA Who hears her name. She looks around, sees Drew but doesn't immediately recognize him. She looks around the park. 
DREW (CONT'D) ASHEMA! Here! She looks at Drew again, and this time recognizes him. Drew arrives and impulsively he gives her a hug, genuinely very happy to see her. Li arrives and pulls them apart. DREW (CONT'D) What!?! LI You can get kicked out of the temple for this... DREW Who's going to tell, Li? You? 
He turns to Ashema, who has now backed off a little bit and is looking at Drew, a smile on her face, but is pretending that she is embarrassed. The other girls are gathered around, giggling. 
DREW 
(pointing at girls) 
Not the giggle girls again! How've you been? You look great! 
ASHEMA 
(hiding a laugh) 
You look... funny. 
DREW (CONT'D) 
Thanks. 
ASHEMA 
How do you like the temple? DREW 
Shhh... nobody's supposed to know. Li tugs at Drew's shirt. LI We really shouldn't be doing this... DREW 
I'm trying to show you guys a good time. (to Ashema) I guess I gotta go. It was great to see you. 
One of the giggle girls behind Ashema whispers something in her ear. She nods and smiles. ASHEMA My school is having a party this Tuesday night. Can you and your friends come? Li and the guys immediately hem and haw their negative replies, but Drew smiles and takes Ashema's hand. The girls start to giggle again. He brings her hand up to his lips, and kisses it gently. DREW We'll be there. INT. DORM ROOM ­ NIGHT ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DORM ROOM, LI STANDING IN FRONT OF DREW, THE REST OF THE DISCIPLES GATHERED AROUND. 
The room is dark ­ it's after lights out. 
LI 
Can't we talk this over? 
The tough pulls his fist back to strike Drew, who has been grabbed by two other toughs, his arms pinned behind his back. 
Suddenly, a figure FLIES in and SLAMS the tough to the ground. 
It is Gao, and he immediately sets on the other toughs. The room ERUPTS in a melee as the disciples go at it with the village toughs. 
The girls are SCREAMING as the boys kick and punch. 
The disciples are winning, having a great time, until the door to the room SLAMS open and the HEADMISTRESS comes storming in, screaming at the top of her lungs for them to stop. 
ANGLE ON DREW, GAO AND THE DISCIPLES 
As they all agree as one to hightail out of there. They go running past the Headmistress and out the door, full speed. 
EXT. GIRLS SCHOOL ­ SAME NIGHT ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DISCIPLES SPRINTING THROUGH THE DARKNESS. EXT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE ­ SAME NIGHT 
ANGLE ON THE DISCIPLES As they climb back into the dorm room. INT. DORM ROOM ­ SAME NIGHT ESTABLISHING SHOT AS THE LAST DISCIPLE CLIMBS THROUGH THE WINDOW ­ IT IS DREW. He lands on the hardwood floor, panting his lungs out after the run. After a BEAT, he lifts his head and looks right at Gao. 
DREW Did you say you were going to keep us OUT of trouble? The group pauses for a BEAT, then they all laugh, relaxing. INT. DINNER ROOM ­ DAY ESTABLISHING SHOT OF GAO CARRYING A PLATE OF CHINESE FOOD OVER TO A TABLE WHERE THE DISCIPLES EATING, THEIR EYES SCANNING THE ROOM FOR SIGNS OF WARNING. Gao sits down and looks around. They are all dressed in their training clothes, dirtied after a full day of training. GAO I can't believe nobody's said anything! It's been a whole day! 
LI 
We broke every major rule the temple has, how could we get away with it? 
DREW 
I think we might have. If they knew, they'd have already gotten us! You guys just have to stop looking so guilty. 
ANGLE ON WU 
Who pushes his dinner away from him. 
WU 
I've lost my appetite. 
DREW 
Let's go back to the dorm for a few minutes, go over our stories in case they seperate us... 
He gets up to leave, and the others follow him. LI 
Seperate us? EXT. COURTYARD ­ SAME DAY IN THE COURTYARD ARE SEVERAL POLICEMEN, WAITING AROUND. Drew and the others spot the cops, and walk quickly to their dorm room. INT. DORM ROOM ­ SAME DAY DREW AND THE OTHERS ARE FRANTIC. 
DREW 
Cops! Somebody called the cops?!? Before anyone can answer, the door opens and the D.S. walks into the room, his face serious. D.S. Drew! Come with me to San De's chamber... He turns to go, but the others are on their feet, ready to follow Drew. D.S. Just Drew. Drew looks at them and shrugs, then follows the D.S. INT. SAN DE CHAMBER ­ EVENING 
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF SAN DE AND THE GIRLS SCHOOL HEADMISTRESS. 
Also in the room are two high-ranking police officials. The Headmistress is yelling at the top of her lungs, and San De is just sitting there, letting her vent. She has obviously been going at it for some time, because her face is sweaty and flushed. She stops when Drew and the D.S. enter and points an accusing finger at Drew. 
HEADMISTRESS 
He's the one! 
SAN DE 
Drew, I think you know Headmistress Low. Correct? 
Drew can only nod. 
SAN DE (CONT'D) 
The police have also come. A morals violation is what brought them... 
Drew's head snaps up at the words "morals charge" POLICE LIEUTENANT We demand that he leaves the temple, and China! POLICE CAPTAIN He's a disgrace, to the temple and to this country. He must leave. They all agree that Drew should leave, and for a moment the sound of the three of them agreeing fills the room (ad libs). ANGLE ON DREW Who is staring down into the abyss. SAN DE 
ANGLE ON DREW Walking through the courtyard, for the last time. Only a few monks are around, and they don't meet Drew's eyes. The sounds of training can be heard O.S. Drew stops to listen to those sounds for a moment, then heads for the door. EXT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE ­ SAME DAY ANGLE ON DREW As he leaves the temple. He pauses for a moment with the door open, then shuts it sadly. He looks out over the courtyard, which is completely deserted. Drew sighs, hitches his backpack onto his back and starts out. As he comes out of the doorway and into the courtyard proper, he sees... THE ENTIRE CLASS OF DISCIPLES 
Dressed in street clothes with their bags packed. Li and Gao are in the front, their bags in their hands, smiling. GAO You're either with us or against us, remember? DREW (smiling) I'm with you! A cheer goes up from the entire group as Drew, Li and Gao embrace. In the b.g. can be seen the D.S., who is observing all this. INT. SAN DE CHAMBER ­ DAY ESTABLISHING SHOT OF SAN DE'S CHAMBER, SAN DE WAITING FOR DREW IN ONE OF THE CHAIRS. 
The door opens and Drew walks in, the D.S. can be seen in the b.g. San De indicates one of the chairs for him to sit in. He does. 
SAN DE 
Quite a show of solidarity, yes? 
Drew nods, trying to hide a smile. He is trying his best to appear humble. 
SAN DE (CONT'D) 
Why did you come to the Shaolin Temple? 
DREW 
(caught off guard) 
To train, Master. 
SAN DE (CONT'D) 
Yet you rebel at every rule, and blame the training for your inability to learn and progress? No response from Drew, who is just looking down at the ground. SAN DE (CONT'D) 
You are like someone swimming in fresh water crying "I thirst!". What you seek is all around you. Don't fight with the ways of the temple, the battle is within yourself. DREW 
Within myself? SAN DE You must accept the responsibility for your life. If we force you out of the temple, you can always blame the 
temple for your failure ­ it never has to be your fault. (beat) Life without committment is no life at all. DREW What if I can't handle it? What if I fail? SAN DE Live for the moment, Drew. The future will take care of itself. If you go through your days here, squeezing every last bit of life out of every minute, you need not fear failure. DREW (after a beat) 
Then, it's up to me. 
SAN DE (CONT'D) 
Yes. Your fellow disciples stood up for you. It's your turn. 
DREW 
I don't want to let them down. 
SAN DE 
Don't let yourself down. 
He bows to San De and then leaves the chamber. 
EXT. CHAMBER ­ SAME NIGHT 
DREW COMES OUT, FINDING GAO AND LI WAITING FOR HIM. 
GAO Are you staying? 
Drew waits for a moment, studying their hopeful faces. DREW Yeah, I'm staying. If only to keep you guys out of trouble! They walk off, and just as they round a corner, a BANG is heard as one of the monks drops the heavy wooden lid of a storage barrell. Drew jumps, spinning around in the direction of the sound. LI 
Drew! Are you allright? DREW 
Yeah, I'm just a little on edge, that's all. Ever since I got to the temple, some nut has been attacking me with a stick ­ at night, in the toilet... anywhere! It's driving me crazy... Gao and Li look at each other, nodding. DREW (CONT'D) What? Honest, it's happening! I... GAO Every class of disciples, the one with the most potential is singled out for special training. We were wondering who it was... now, we know. DREW Special training? You mean...? 
Gao and Li nod, and Drew walks with them, shaking his head. 
EXT. COUNTRYSIDE ­ MORNING 
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF ASHEMA STANDING NEXT TO THE STREAM, WATCHING THE WATER RUSH BY. 
In the b.g. comes Drew, dressed in his monastic robes, no hat on his head. He is making no attempt to hide the fact that he is a monk. 
Drew walks up to Ashema and takes her hand, and they stand like that for a moment. She then turns to him, and starts to say something. Drew stops her with a finger on her lips, then strokes her cheek. 
Who have now spotted a man and his young son. They are both loaded down with goods from the store, and the thugs stop them. They take the things from them, and start to walk off. 
The father tries to fight back, but they easily beat him up, sending him into the dirt. The young boy runs forward. The leader of the thugs raises his hand, ready to slap the boy's face. 
Before he can bring his arm forward, Drew's fingers come around his wrist, stopping it. 
DREW (CONT'D) 
Oh, I don't think so... 
ANGLE ON THE CROWD 
It's getting good now. The fight    starts, and this    time Drew is unencumbered by    vows of non- violence.    He has a cause,    and he's enjoying every minute    of the fight. It    is over quickly,    as Drew is a superb fighter,    using incredible    techniques. The    thugs limp away, leaving Drew    with the little boy    and his father. 
Drew bends down and picks up the goods, handing them back to the boy and the father. Drew stops and kneels down in front of the boy, looking deep into his eyes. A whisper is going through the crowd: "Shaolin". Drew touches the boy's cheek, smiles, then stands up and bows. He moves on, the crowd watching him walk away. HOLD ON BOY'S FACE He now has a hero. 
EXT. COUNTRYSIDE ­ DAY ANGLE ON DREW WALKING THROUGH THE COUNTRYSIDE. HE STOPS AT A CROSSING IN THE ROAD, CONSULTS THE MAP SAN DE GAVE HIM, THEN WALKS ON. EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE ­ EVENING ANGLE ON DREW As he climbs the side of a mountain. EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE TEMPLE ­ NIGHT ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW, MEDITATING NEXT TO HIS SMALL FIRE. It is dark around him, with vague forms of the temple columns and statues. Drew is sitting with his eyes closed, oblivious to his surroundings. EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE ­ NEXT DAY 
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW WORKING OUT NEXT TO A MOUNTAIN LAKE. 
He is throwing kicks and going through his routines, concentrating on his breathing. As he finishes a particularly strenuous series, he strips off his clothes and dives into the lake. 
As Drew's head breaks the surface of the lake, he is surprised to see a beautiful woman standing next to where he left his clothes. 
Drew starts to get out of the lake, then remembers that he is naked ­ he stops, not quite knowing what to do. He goes as close to the shore as he can without coming out of the water. 
The woman just smiles, and starts to strip off what clothing she has on. She is very sexy. 
DREW 
No, don't do that! 
WOMAN Why not? 
DREW I'm a monk. I've taken a vow to abstain... WOMAN 
No one will know... DREW I'll know! Throw me my clothes, please. Pouting, the woman takes Drew's pants and tosses them to him, but they land (purposely) about 5 feet away from the lake edge. DREW (CONT'D) 
Nice throw... ANGLE ON DREW Who realizes he is going to have to get out of the water without a cover. He gets up and hurries to where his pants are. He starts to put them on, and the woman is all over him, trying to seduce him. He takes her hands in his and forces her to look him in the eye. DREW (CONT'D) Despite the fact that this is every teenage boy's dream come true, I can't! He lowers her hands, and her head drops, pouting. DREW (CONT'D) Besides, if I were to break my vows, it would not be with you. 
He kisses her on the forehead, and then grabs the rest of his clothes, running up the path away from the lake. 
EXT. TEMPLE ­ SAME DAY 
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF VERY ORNATE TEMPLE. 
Drew walks up to the front of the temple, looks around for a moment, then takes a drink of water from the well out front. 
Just as he starts to drink, a huge TOUR BUS pulls up in front, air brakes HISSING. Before he can react, the doors open and a bunch of AMERICAN TOURISTS pile out of the bus and rush into the temple, jostling Drew from side to side. 
TOURIST 1 
Not another temple! 
TOURIST 2 Do they have a gift shop? 
TOURIST 3 Guide! How do you say 'gift shop'? GUIDE 
You have 10 minutes to be back on the bus. The wave of tourists passes Drew, and he stands there looking after them. Then, as a group, they realize that they just passes a monk, and turn back to Drew. TOURIST 1 A real live monk! Somebody, take my picture! 
The tourist runs up to where Drew is and stands next to him. The cameras click and whirr, and Drew is thoroughly embarrassed. When the 
first pictures are over, and someone else wants to stand next to him, he raises his hands up to his face and bows. DREW Oh Mi Two Fwo He then turns and walks away. GUIDE (O.S.) Monks don't like to be bothered, they are from a different world. DREW I'll say... EXT. WATERFALL ­ EARLY MORNING 
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF THUNDERING WATERFALL. 
Drew stands at the side of the waterfall, studying his map. From his expression, we know that he has to go through the waterfall to get where he is going. 
Drew pockets the map, checks that the box is safely in place, then starts toward the waterfall. The drop off the side of the waterfall is incedible ­ steep and deadly. 
DREW (CONT'D) 
Of course, you're right. No excuses... 
Drew bows once more and is ready to leave. The Arhat reaches into his robes and pulls out the embroidered box that Drew was given at the temple. 
DREW (CONT'D) 
You have it? How? 
The Arhat holds up the box in front of Drew for a moment, then tears it in two with his hands, scattering the pieces to the winds. 
DREW (CONT'D) 
So, I didn't fail, huh? 
(beat) 
I can ask my question, then? 
The Arhat sits without moving or speaking. Drew takes that as a yes. DREW (CONT'D) What is the meaning of life? 
The Arhat ponders that for a moment, then smiles and puts his sandles on his head and stands up. 
ARHAT What is life? What is reality? The head of a dead cat. He walks off, leaving Drew sitting there, dumbstruck by the answer. DREW (smiling ruefully) 
I just climbed a mountain to ask a loon about the meaning of life. He shakes his head and gets up, following the Arhat. The Arhat is standing on the other side of his hut, the sandles still on his head. ARHAT For forty years, Shaolin disciples have made their quest to deliver a scroll to me. You are not Chinese. DREW No. American. ARHAT I notice the littlest details. DREW 
How many succeeded? 
ARHAT 
A handful. You chose correctly. Nothing is more precious than human life. 
DREW 
But, I didn't obey. 
ARHAT 
(smiling slightly) 
At the beginning of your training, you were to obey without question. Now, as you become a Shaolin, you must learn to question everything, and obey yourself. 
Drew and the monk bow to each other, the sunset over the mountain in the b.g. 
DISSOLVE TO: EXT. ARHAT HUT ­ NEXT MORNING 
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW COMING OUT OF THE HUT, HAVING JUST GOTTEN UP. The Arhat is already out there, moving through his gong fu moves. DREW 
I have to leave. What is the easiest way to get back to the temple. 
ARHAT The bus. Drew laughs at the crazy reply and starts for the mountain path that brought him to the hut. The Arhat runs after him, grabs his sleeve 
and pulls him over to a place behind his hut. DREW'S POV OF A ROAD BEHIND THE ARHAT'S HUT A road! After all he went through to get there? ARHAT (CONT'D) Bus stops every 20 min., will take you straight to the temple. Drew smiles and shakes his head, then bows to the Arhat. The Arhat returns the bow. DREW Thank you, Master. ARHAT 
They should give you a bus schedule with that map... 
He walks off to the hut, while Drew makes his way down to the bus stop. 
EXT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE ­ DAY 
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW WALKING BACK INTO THE TEMPLE. 
He is dirty, weary but triumphant. As he walks back through the temple to San De's chambers to report, he sees a group of people walking out the other way. 
The group is made up of the thugs who attacked him, the woman by the lake, and the man from the bridge. They are talking together on their way out. 
ANGLE ON DREW 
Drew is caught off guard, and is hit several times, driven back to the door of the chamber. The statues stop moving. 
Drew, a little scared, tries to remember the sequence of the statues, letting his arms practice for the attacks. 
There is fear in his eyes. 
He starts in again, and the attacks come again, but they are different this time. 
Drew is clobbered. 
Driven back to the door, Drew slumps against the wall. His face is already bruised and bleeding. DREW (whispering) I can't do it. FLASHBACK TO D.S. 
D.S. There is no can't, only won't. FLASHBACK TO SEVERAL D.S. ATTACKS 
Including the one where Drew succeeded in evading them. 
ANGLE ON DREW Who gathers himself, straightens up and takes a deep breath, forcing it out in a breathing exercise. DREW (CONT'D) I am a Shaolin monk. He enters the chamber again, and the attacks start again. Drew, however, is prepared (both mentally and physically). He blocks, avoids, rolls, jumps and redirects the attacks on him, making his way across. He is about halfway across when an especially fierce and large statue comes crashing towards him. Drew, caught a little off guard, quickly adjusts and manages to jump and spin out of the way. 
Suddenly, as he turns and tries to get his breath, two huge, deadly spears are streaking towards him. Drew blocks the SPEARS with his arms, misdirecting them into the wall behind him. 
They THWOCK into the wall, sticking there. 
As he rounds a particularly difficult series of statues, a volley of ARROWS comes HURTLING towards him. Drew blocks some, avoids others, and catches one in each hand. He throws them down and continues on. 
He goes past the few remaining statues, and is out of the Wooden Man Chamber. All that is left is to walk down a little hallway and out the door. 
Drew looks behind him, then starts to walk. He goes cautiously, expecting a trap or a trick. 
Nothing happens. 
He gets to the door and looks for a handle on the door. He spots a handhold near the top of the door, and pulls it with his hand. 
Immediately, his hands is locked in and a panel in the ceiling DROPS right onto his arm, forcing it down. Drew fights back with his muscles, the veins popping out in his arms and neck. Behind him, a statue has started coming towards him, spinning like a dervish. Its fists and legs are extended, and they are deadly. The panel drops lower and lower. FLASHBACK TO UNBENDABLE ARM SEQUENCE 
ANGLE ON DREW As he relaxes his face, and forcibly relaxes his arm and entire body, letting his inner energy take over. ANGLE ON PANEL 
As it slows with a GRINDING NOISE, then stops. 
ANGLE ON DREW Holding up the heavy stone panel with his arm, his face and body completely relaxed. The panel goes back up into the ceiling, and the door opens. The whirling statue slows, and then stops altogether. Drew reaches up with a hook kick and taps it in the face. DREW (CONT'D) Not this time. Drew quickly walks through the door. EXT. TEMPLE ­ SAME DAY ESTABLISHING SHOT OF CHEERING ASSEMBLAGE, SAN DE AND D.S. AT THE FRONT. HE HAS MADE IT! 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. TEMPLE ­ SAME DAY 
MONTAGE OF SHOTS OF OTHER DISCIPLES ­ GAO, LI AND WU MAKE IT THROUGH, JOINING THE OTHERS AS FULL-FLEDGED FIGHTING MONKS. 
Drew is there each time to embrace them and congratulate them. 
EXT. TEMPLE ­ SAME DAY 
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF SAN DE AND D.S. STANDING BEFORE THE ASSEMBLED DISCIPLES. 
There are a few missing from their ranks, monks who did not make it through the chamber, but the majority of them are there. The entire temple is gathered to watch the ceremony. 
San De and D.S. are dressed in elaborate ceremonial robes. 
After he goes through some complicated ceremonial movements, including the waving of smoking incense over them, San De spreads his hands 
SAN DE You are now Shaolin. We welcome you into our ranks as fighting monks... A roar rises from the assembled monks, and fireworks go off all around. ANGLE ON REAR OF COURTYARD 
Where a huge red sheet is pulled back to reveal tables laden with Chinese dishes, wine and other foods. 
The party gets going and is soon in full gear. ANGLE ON DREW, GAO AND LI As they congratulate themselves, and gorge themselves on the huge 
tables of Chinese food. ANGLE ON THE ENTIRE GROUP They are enjoying themselves. This only happens once every couple of years, and the monks are intent on enjoying themselves. ANGLE ON SAN DE (DREW'S POV) Who is walking towards the side of the temple, away from the party. ANGLE ON DREW Who sees him leave. He excuses himself from his group. CUT TO: EXT. BAMBOO GROVE ­ SAME EVENING 
ANGLE ON SAN DE 
Who is walking in the bamboo grove, his hands behind him. Drew walks up to him and they bow. 
Who finishes the shaolin fighter off with a devestating technique, and then immediately plays to the crowd, RIGHT IN FRONT OF DREW AND THE OTHERS. 
The referee comes over to Trevor, and raises his fist up in victory. Trevor tears his arm away and SCREAMS TO THE CROWD: 
TREVOR (CONT'D) 
I'M NOT DONE! 
The crowd, which before was wild and booing, now grows quiet. 
TREVOR (CONT'D) 
I want HIM! 
He points right at Drew. 
TREVOR (CONT'D) 
I want to face the American who is now a Shaolin monk! I want to learn at the hands of a master! 
The crowd, who has seen Drew and heard about him for quite a while, warms to the prospect. They start cheering for the American Shaolin to face Trevor. 
TREVOR (CONT'D) I want the American Shaolin! ANGLE ON DREW 
Who doesn't know what to do. San De appears and puts a comforting hand on his shoulder. 
ANGLE ON TREVOR Pointing and yelling for Drew. ANGLE ON DREW 
Who climbs the ropes and goes into the ring. The crowd is going crazy, eager to see the match. Drew, oblivious to the crowd, walks over to Trevor. DREW I came to the Shaolin Temple because of you, Trevor. You humiliated me, and I wanted to make sure it could never happen again. TREVOR So, let's see what you've learned. DREW (shaking his head) I've learned that... there's nothing to prove. Beating you is no longer important. It was my ego that had to be defeated, not you. 
TREVOR (CONT'D) 
Bull! You're just chicken! 
DREW 
The arts should never be about who is best ­ they are too important for that. 
He bows to Trevor and starts out of the ring. 
ANGLE ON CROWD 
They don't know what's going on. 
ANGLE ON LI, GAO AND OTHERS 
They don't know either. They want Drew to fight him. 
ANGLE ON SAN DE AND D.S. Who know what is happening and are proud of Drew, prouder than they have ever been. TREVOR 
COME BACK HERE! You can't just walk away! Drew steps out of the ring and walks over to where San De is standing. They bow, and the pride is shining in San De's eyes. SAN DE 
Do you turn away from him out of fear? ANGLE ON TREVOR Who is seething. 
TREVOR 
I thought the Shaolin monks were warriors, not babies! Look at him ­ he is too scared to face me! ANGLE ON DREW His face calm. DREW No, master. I will not fight for personal glory, or for my ego. SAN DE You have learned much. ANGLE ON TREVOR TREVOR 
The Shaolin monks are PUSSIES! Warrior-monks? Ha! 
ANGLE ON SAN DE 
Who indicates trevor with a inclination of his head. 
SAN DE 
You did the right thing. 
ANGLE ON TREVOR

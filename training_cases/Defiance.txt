Clayton Frohman & Edward Zwick 
FADE IN: 
1 NEW YORK CITY - PARK AVENUE - NIGHT - 1982 1 A TAXI pulls over to a curb where an ELDERLY MAN waits with his MIDDLE-AGED SON in THE RAIN. 
MIDDLE-AGED SON (as they climb in) 23rd and Lex. The CABBIE grunts a reply. 
MIDDLE-AGED SON (CONT'D) How ya doin', Papa, you doin' alright? 
ELDERLY MAN Fine, fine... 
MIDDLE-AGED SON This is just a check-up, okay? Doctor Katz says you'll outlive us all. (looks out the window) Traffic isn't bad. We should be back in time to watch the Mets. He notices his father is STARING, wide-eyed, at the cabby's HACK LICENSE. We glimpse only the last name..."Bielski." 
MIDDLE-AGED SON (CONT'D) Papa? .Papa, what is it? IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR, the old man catches the furtive eyes of the cabby. 
ELDERLY MAN ...You. Can it be? The eyes in the mirror look away. And then back. 
ELDERLY MAN (CONT'D) Bielski. Can it possibly be? As we PUSH IN on the eyes in the mirror, we HEAR THE 
DESPERATE RASPING SOUND OF PANTING. 
CUT TO: 
2 A MAN RUNNING FOR HIS LIFE THROUGH THE WOODS. 2 Bombs EXPLODE all around as he passes dead bodies and BURNT- OUT VEHICLES. Without slowing he discards a WW II Red Army helmet, a field jacket, a heavy pack, anything that might impede his flight. He glances back up over his shoulder. The sky is filled with BOMBERS. He runs on.

4 THE VILLAGE OF NALIBOKI 4 A typical Eastern European shtetl. LOCAL POLICE help German Einsatzgruppen, mobile killing squads, round up Jews. PEASANTS beat them with sticks as they are herded into lines. One man tries to run and is beaten. Others look on, or look away with indifference as they are loaded onto waiting trucks. 
5 TWO MEN HIDE IN THE NEARBY WOODS (ZUS & ASAEL BIELSKI) 5 We study their faces: a turbulent portrait of impotent rage, terrible fear, overwhelming grief, and secret relief. 
ASAEL Where are they taking them? 
ZUS --Shveig! Shveig! 
ASAEL 
BUT-- 
ZUS Just shut up! Please... 
6 AN ALLEY WAY IN NOVAGRUDOK 6 The man we last saw in flight (TUVIA BIELSKI) wearing the remnants of his uniform, slips down a cobble-stoned street. He ducks into a doorway as A PATROL passes by. 
6A A REMOTE FARM 6A Zus and Asael move warily through a barnyard. A tethered dog BARKS furiously. A farmer challenges them. 
WALENCKI (in Russian; subtitles) 
WHAT DO YOU WANT? Walencki brandishes a pitchfork. 
ASAEL (in Russian; subtitles) Some food...? 
WALENCKI They are looking for you people. The two brothers glance nervously around. 
WALENCKI (CONT'D) Get away from here! GO! ZUS, the older of the two brothers, takes a menacing step toward the farmer but his younger brother holds him back. 
(CONTINUED)

6A CONTINUED: 6A 
ASAEL Zus. Let's go. As they retreat toward the woods, Zus warns the farmer. 
ZUS We'll be back. 
7 A BOURGEOIS APARTMENT -- DAY 7 Tuvia is getting dressed as AN ATTRACTIVE WOMAN -- his wife, RIFKA -- stands by the window, smoking a cigarette. 
TUVIA And no news of my brothers? 
RIFKA They are used to trouble, they'll be all right. 
TUVIA If you stay, you'll have to go to the ghetto. 
RIFKA I can get false papers and pass as a gentile. So can you. Tuvia shakes his head, no. He finishes dressing. Theirs is a relationship long past passion. 
RIFKA (CONT'D) Will you at least stay tonight? 
TUVIA I need to see to my family. Will you come? 
RIFKA To the country? No. 
CUT TO: 
TUVIA Is there anything left to eat? Only a few potatoes in Asael's bag. WORMS writhe among them. 
ASAEL Zus finished the last of the sausage. Tuvia glares at Zus, who glares back. Sibling rivals. 
ZUS Stankowicz' farm is closest. 
ASAEL He has dogs. 
ZUS Fuck the dogs. Wilencki then. 
TUVIA You think Wilencki is going to give us food? 
ZUS No. We take it. 
TUVIA How? 
ZUS We...Take...It.

TUVIA And he tells the police. 
ZUS I have run from the police my whole life. Do you really think it's a good time to stop? A moment of decision. Who holds the balance of power? 
ASAEL We know these woods. They'll never find us in here. Tuvia looks at his brothers. He has been outvoted. 
CUT TO: 
15 THE SMALL FARMHOUSE 15 where Zus and Asael first tried to get food. Asael waits outside, anxiously on guard. 
16 INSIDE 16 The farmer (WALENCKI) who threatened them with the pitchfork sits eating a simple dinner. Zus and Tuvia burst in. Zus brandishes a hoe. 
ZUS (in Russian; subtitles) We want food. Be quick about it! 
WALENCKI (in Russian; subtitles) You again! 
ZUS 
NOW! 
WALENCKI Sure, sure. Take what you want... Tuvia begins to stuff provisions into a sack. 
ZUS Where is your gun, farmer? 
WALENCKI I have no gun. Zus grabs a dinner plate and SMASHES IT IN THE FARMER'S 
FACE. 
ZUS 
WHERE IS YOUR GUN? Holding his bloody face, the farmer cowers in fear. 
(CONTINUED) 
GOLDENROD Revision - 8-16-07 8. 
16 CONTINUED: 16 
WALENCKI Please... Zus kicks him. 
WALENCKI (CONT'D) I beg you... 
TUVIA 
ZUS-- 
ZUS He's lying. He kicks him again. The farmer begins to weep. 
ZUS (CONT'D) You're lying! Zus dumps the remains of the farmer's dinner onto him. 
ZUS (CONT'D) If I hit you once more, you will shit your pants. Twice and you will never shit again. The farmer knows Zus won't hesitate. 
WALENCKI Up there... Zus kicks the man aside. Above the stove is an old rifle. Zus grabs it, points it at the farmer. 
ZUS We were never here. 
CUT TO: 
17 THE BROTHERS 17 running through the woods. Zus raises the rifle in triumph. 
TUVIA He was willing to help us. 
ZUS He's lucky I didn't crush his head.

34 INSIDE THE HOUSE 34 The POLICE CAPTAIN we saw earlier eats dinner with his WIFE and TWO SONS. They speak in Russian. 
WIFE You worked late. The man nods, his mouth full of food. 
WIFE (CONT'D) Tomorrow is Sunday. You have a day off, yes? 
POLICE CAPTAIN (still chewing; nods) ...Fucking SS never sleeps... The door OPENS slowly. They all look up. 
(CONTINUED) 
YELLOW Revision - 7-30-07 18. 
34 CONTINUED: 34 Tuvia stands on the threshold, dripping wet, a spectral figure. He holds the pistol at his side. 
TUVIA You know who I am? The policeman says nothing. His wife is instantly terrified. One of the SONS stands. Tuvia turns the gun on him. 
TUVIA (CONT'D) Sit. The son obeys. The SOUND of the rain on the tin roof is deafening. Tuvia turns back to the Police Captain. 
TUVIA (CONT'D) And you know why I am here. 
POLICE CAPTAIN ...what are you talking about? 
TUVIA You have no idea what I'm talking about... 
POLICE CAPTAIN If they say find someone, I find him. It's my job. 
TUVIA To find Jews. 
POLICE CAPTAIN Or lose my job. 
TUVIA And it's a good job, isn't it? You like your job. 
POLICEMAN I was always fair with your family. ...Everyone knew you were smuggling this and that. But I looked the other way. (in desperation) ...Ask your father. 
TUVIA My father? You don't talk about my father... Tuvia places the pistol against the man's forehead. 
TUVIA (CONT'D) Down on your knees.

TUVIA (CONT'D) 
(BELLOWING) 
ON...YOUR...KNEES...PIG! The policeman begins to weep. 
TUVIA (CONT'D) For my parents, David and Beila Bielski... for my brothers and all the others-- 
POLICE CAPTAIN Please.... I beg you... One of the man's SONS makes a move toward Tuvia. Tuvia SHOOTS him in the chest. His mother SCREAMS. The Policeman suddenly starts to stand. Tuvia backs away, shoots him. And then the other son. It is all over in seconds. 
35 OMITTED 35 
36 TUVIA STANDS THERE, FROZEN 36 The police captain's wife is prostrate and KEENING over her dead family in Russian. 
WIFE Kill me, too! Tuvia should indeed kill her, too. To avoid being identified. 
TUVIA Tell them who did this. 
CUT TO: 
36A EXT. POLICE CAPTAIN'S HOUSE - DUSK 36A 
The rain still pours down on the house as Tuvia runs away. 
37 A FOREST TRAIL - STILL RAINING 37 Tuvia pushes through dense forest. Branches rake his face. Finally he leans against a tree. We move CLOSE on his face. 
TUVIA Riboynoy shel oylam, riboynoy shel oylam... (closes his eyes) Lord of the universe, forgive me, I have murdered -- but they were monsters and did not deserve to live. 
DOUBLE BLUE Revision - 9-17-07 20. 
38 NEXT MORNING - A LOW FOG CLINGS TO THE FOREST FLOOR 38 Zus awakens, sodden and stiff. He looks at the group, now numbering fourteen. People sleep huddled together: Asael holds Aron; Avram keeps his surviving daughter close. And there is Tuvia -- sitting by the fire. Zus takes the pistol from Tuvia's belt. Checks the cylinder. 
ZUS Only one bullet left. 
TUVIA His sons. Zus nods his approval. 
ZUS How was it? 
TUVIA What? 
ZUS To kill them. It was good, no? 
TUVIA Shut up. Tuvia stares into the fire. He is dirty and tired. Zus looks around. 
TUVIA As long as his village wife stays in hiding. 
MALBIN Nice to know there are some things even Hitler can't destroy.

DOUBLE BLUE Revision - 9-17-07 23. 
40A CONTINUED: 40A Suddenly the camp grows quiet. TWO YOUNG MEN who have emerged from the forest, their clothes dirty and torn. One of them aims an army-issue rifle. 
ZUS Hello, boys, what can we do for you? 
YOUNG MAN #1 Food. We want food. Everyone remains still. Zus eyes his own rifle nearby. 
ZUS These little shits are holding us up. The Young Man motions his partner to take Zus's rifle. 
ZUS (CONT'D) You little shits have the balls to shoot me? In response, the young man CHAMBERS A ROUND. 
TUVIA This is all the food we have. You are welcome to share. 
ZUS No.

YOUNG MAN #1 You are Jews? 
(CONTINUED) 
GREEN Revision - 8-8-07 24. 
40A CONTINUED: (3) 40A 
ZUS No. We're the Gestapo, you little shit. 
TUVIA Come. Sit. Put down your guns. 
ZUS Or perhaps you'd prefer I shove them up your ass. 
TUVIA Where are you from? The young man glares at Zus. Then, to Tuvia: 
YOUNG MAN #1 Horodyszcze. The name freezes Zus in his tracks. His wife is there. 
PERETZ We haven't eaten in two days. My name is Peretz, this is Jacov. 
JACOV Two days ago there were three thousand Jews in Horodyszcze. Now there are fifty. Me and him, we hid in a wall. 
ZUS You know a woman there, Sonia Bielski? The men look at one another. 
JACOV We knew her. Zus can hardly bring himself to ask the next question. 
ZUS ...There was a child. Jacov shakes his head. Sorry. Zus leans his head against a tree. After a moment he begins to BEAT HIS HEAD against it until BLOOD pours down his face. 
ASAEL (to the newcomers) His family. Tuvia puts his arms around his brother. Zus's shoulders begin to heave. Soon his body convulses with deep wracking sobs. He is absolutely unself-conscious in his grief. 
(CONTINUED) 
GREEN Revision - 8-8-07 25. 
40A CONTINUED: (4) 40A 
ZUS So many dead. 
TUVIA I know. 
ZUS Mama. Papa. Their heads are close together, their faces wet with tears. 
ZUS (CONT'D) Why not us? 
TUVIA I don't know. 
ZUS I thought they'd be safe. I should have been with them. 
TUVIA No. 
ZUS I could have protected them. Tuvia just holds him. He, too, is crying quietly. 
ZUS (CONT'D) Better to be rabbits? Hunted? Hiding? No... Zus breaks free of Tuvia's embrace and walks away. 
41 LATER - BY THE FIRE 41 Jacov and Peretz are eating. Between ravenous bites-- 
PERETZ We are looking for partisans. 
ZUS (CONT'D) 
WE ARE THE BIELSKI OTRIAD! WE ARE 
JEWS! YOU LIKE TO KILL JEWS! HERE 
WE ARE! WE ARE THE BIELSKI'S! 
TELL THEM! Tuvia looks around warily. This is getting out of hand. 
CUT TO: 
44 A ROADSIDE DITCH - LATER THAT NIGHT 44 Tuvia and Asael lie in on one side of a road. Tuvia has looped ONE END OF THE WIRE around a post. 
45 IN THE DITCH ON THE OTHER SIDE 45 Zus, Peretz, and Jacov WRAP THE WIRE to a tree. 
46 UP AHEAD 46 The lights of a MOTORCYCLE, a GERMAN COURIER. 
47 IN THE DITCH 47 Tuvia waits until the BIKE is almost upon them. Then he TIGHTENS the WIRE so it stretches INVISIBLY ACROSS THE ROAD. 
GOLDENROD Revision - 8-16-07 29. 
48 THE MOTORCYCLIST IS GARROTED 48 by the wire. His bike goes sliding away as the Bielski's swarm him, KILLING HIM with the last bullet from the Mahkarov. ZUS rummages through the downed-bike's saddlebags. He finds a beautiful KNIFE and lifts it up triumphantly. 
PERETZ Look--! MORE HEADLIGHTS fast approaching. 
TUVIA Hide! Everyone! They all scramble back into the ditch, dragging the dead courier with them. 
49 A GERMAN STAFF CAR 49 approaches. As its headlights pick up the downed motorcycle, it slows and pulls off to the side -- 
50 DIRECTLY OVER THE DITCH 50 Where Tuvia and Zus are concealed. From within the car, we hear VOICES SPEAKING GERMAN. A YOUNG PRIVATE gets out and walks up the road to investigate. 
PRIVATE (in German; subtitled) It's one of ours, but no one is here. Maybe he was drunk? From the car, an SERGEANT yells a reply. 
SERGEANT (in German; subtitled) Move it off the road before the convoy passes. I'll report the sonuvabitch. As the soldier drags the bike off the road, AN OFFICER steps out of the car and lights a cigarette. He's followed by the Sergeant. He carries a Schmeisser SUBMACHINE GUN dangling from his shoulder. 
51 IN THE DITCH - ZUS 51 can see the Sergeant's feet peeking out over the ditch. 
A STREAM OF PISS Cascades onto him. He tries to inch his body away... 
(CONTINUED) 
GOLDENROD Revision - 8-16-07 30. 
51 CONTINUED: 51 
THE PISSING SERGEANT catches the flicker of MOVEMENT below, SEES Zus lying in the ditch. Stunned, he tries to zip up his fly. It catches. ZUS LEAPS UP brandishing the KNIFE. He's on the Sergeant before he can get the gun off his shoulder. Stabbing him through his greatcoat, the BLADE BREAKS OFF IN HIS HAND. MEANWHILE, THE LIEUTENANT drops his cigarette, reaching under his coat for a pistol. Tuvia TACKLES him. The GUN skids away. They roll around on the road, CLAWING, PUNCHING, BITING. Tuvia SLAMS the man's head against the pavement. 
52 UP THE ROAD 52 The Private sees Asael and Peretz coming at him. Jacov follows with his rifle. The Private turns and runs down the road. They give chase. 
53 FROM INSIDE THE CAR 53 Another OFFICER is in the back seat with A WOMAN. He reaches for his gun, stands up in the seat and begins FIRING WILDLY at Tuvia. TUVIA ROLLS UNDER THE CAR, avoiding the burst. MEANWHILE, ZUS USES THE HANDLE OF THE KNIFE to BREAK the Sergeant's nose. He RIPS the SCHMEISSER away, firing point- blank into the man, whose greatcoat CATCHES FIRE. 
INSIDE THE STAFF CAR The officer takes close aim at Tuvia, just as ZUS TURNS THE MACHINE GUN on the car BLOWING OUT THE WINDOWS, killing the Officer and the woman -- and saving his brother's life. 
54 MEANWHILE, DOWN THE ROAD 54 Jacov fires at the Private, MISSES. The man keeps RUNNING. Jacov fires again. MISSES AGAIN. FINALLY his THIRD SHOT hits him in the leg. The Private keeps running. Limping now. 
JACOV I got him! Peretz and Asael can now catch up to the soldier. 
FROM FAR AWAY We SEE them knock the Private to the ground, KICKING him until Jacov catches up to them and FIRES A FINAL SHOT. 
GREEN Revision - 8-8-07 31. 
55 BACK AT THE STAFF CAR 55 Tuvia stands, out of breath. 
TUVIA Stupid! The gunfire could be heard for miles. 
ZUS He was pissing on my head. Zus is high from the killing, covered in the dead man's blood. He begins calling out orders. 
ZUS (CONT'D) Peretz, Jacov, check the car for guns... (to Tuvia) This one's yours. He presents him with the Schmeisser as if it were a trophy. Tuvia accepts it, checking the gun efficiently. 
ZUS (CONT'D) I'll check his pockets for more ammo. 
TUVIA Hurry--! 
AT THE STAFF CAR Peretz and Jacov emerge with two MACHINE-PISTOLS, several BOTTLES OF SCHNAPPS and a beautiful LEICA CAMERA. 
JACOV They were on their way to a party! They toss one bottle to Zus and another to Tuvia. 
56 UP THE ROAD 56 Asael stands over the dead Private. He isn't much older than Aron. 
57 BACK AT THE STAFF CAR 57 ZUS rifles the pockets of the dead Sergeant for ammo. He finds cigarettes and the man's wallet. He opens it. 
ZUS Welcome to Belarus, herr Henkel. A CHAMPAGNE CORK POPS as Peretz and Jacov toast their victory. 
PERETZ Now we are real Partisans...

63 CONTINUED: 63 THE WOMAN begins to cry. 
MIRIAM My poor sister...dear God, no... Meanwhile, Peretz's MOANING ceases. A woman grumbles: 
WOMAN #1 We'd be better off in the ghetto... 
TAMARA At least here we are safe. 
LOVA There at least we had hope... 
SHIMON No. Here, we have hope. A FEW MORE join in, grumbling their dissatisfaction. Others take the opposite position. These are Jews, after all, and arguing is a revered sport and a pastime. It escalates. 
WOMAN #1 We are hungry! This is a defining moment for Tuvia. When at first he speaks, it is awkward, ineffectual amid the growing tumult. 
TUVIA I know we have no food. But tomorrow... tomorrow will be another mission. 
RONA Look what happened the last time. 
TUVIA That was a mistake! But the mistakes we made will not be made again! More objections. Tuvia must raise his voice to be heard. 
TUVIA (CONT'D) We could be here a long time. And we have to prepare. 
LOVA How? 
TUVIA Better security. Better at getting food and information-- (talking over their 
OBJECTIONS) --at making shelters. Whatever is needed. We all participate. We don't work against each other. At this he looks directly at Zus. Daring him to object. 
(CONTINUED) 
DOUBLE PINK Revision - 9-27-07 36A. 
63 CONTINUED: (2) 63 
TUVIA (CONT'D) I want to kill Nazis, too, but we...just...cannot afford revenge. Not right now. We cannot afford to lose friends like Jacov and Peretz. A small voice speaks up. 
ARON Or Asael. Everyone stares. It is the first time Aron has spoken. 
(CONTINUED) 
DOUBLE PINK Revision - 9-27-07 37. 
63 CONTINUED: (3) 63 
TUVIA Or Asael. We... We-- (trying to hold it 
TOGETHER) --cannot lose anyone. He looks from face to face. Filthy, ravaged, many of them with tears in their eyes. This is what they need -- leadership, faith, something to believe in. And gradually, his tentativeness and awkwardness is replaced by something else. A new voice. From deep inside. 
TUVIA (CONT'D) ...We will map out where we've been so as to not visit the same farms too often. And we take only from those who can afford to give, and leave those who can't alone. 
LOVA The poorest farmer has more than us. 
TUVIA True. But what I am saying is... what I mean is... We are not thieves. (his resolve growing with every word) Or murderers. We may be hunted like animals but we will not become animals. (looks at them all) We have all chosen this -- to live free, like human beings, for as long as we can. Each day of freedom is an act of faith. And if we die trying to live, at least we die like human beings. His mission statement. A vision of their future. Everyone nods in mute acknowledgement. Zus lowers his head. The shift in power between them has occurred. Tuvia has emerged as the undisputed leader.

TUVIA Now. They leave their cover and approach warily, guns at the ready. 
66 OUTSIDE THE HOUSE 66 Koscik's wife looks up from her garden and glares at them. 
TUVIA Hello. She refuses to be flattered. In Russian: 
KOSCIK'S WIFE In the barn. 
67 IN THE BARN 67 Zus calls out. 
ZUS Koscik, put your pants back on and leave those sheep alone. He steps into the shadows to find: 
KOSCIK HANGING FROM A THRESHING HOOK that has been driven through his chest. A sign attached to the hook reads (in Polish) "JEW LOVER." 
TUVIA What's her name? 
ASAEL Chaya. [I believe.] 
TUVIA 
(YELLING) 
CHAYA! He waves as Chaya turns to look in their direction. Asael smiles, embarrassed. 
TUVIA (CONT'D) So talk to her. 
ASAEL I hardly know her. 
TUVIA You spent three days in a cellar! Asael blushes, returns the focus to their prior conversation. 
ASAEL Malbin says the Piznarksi granary is full. We need two guns at least... 
TUVIA Whose turn to go? 
ASAEL Zus. 
TUVIA You go along, just to make sure he understands my orders. Asael nods. 
TUVIA (CONT'D) (re: Chaya) Go on...Go!

74 NEAR A SHED ROOF - BEN ZION 74 We notice a FEW NEW FACES. Their number has exceeded twenty. Among them are two lumbering, dark-skinned men, ARKADY and MOTL LUBCZANSKI. Ben Zion is showing Lazar and the other newcomers how to clean a weapon. 
BEN ZION This is not a gun. It is Bar Kochba's spear. It is Ehud's sword. You fix the patch to the rod-- They do as he instructs. 
BEN ZION (CONT'D) --then run it through the barrel... and don't lose the patch in the 
BARREL-- Lazar looks up, sheepishly. 
LAZAR I lost my patch. ARKADY LUBCZANSKI whispers contemptuously to his brother, 
MOTL... 
ARKADY LUBCZANSKI The village idiot. Zus shoves Arkady out of the way and approaches Lazar, who cowers. But rather than abuse him, Zus removes the patch from the rifle and hands it back to him. 
LAZAR Thank you, Zus. 
ZUS (returning the rifle) It's nothing.

76 A ROADSIDE - NEXT DAY 76 KISSELY is a MILKMAN with bright red hair and a bushy mustache. He leads a horse-drawn CART laden with milk cans. ZUS AND THE OTHERS rise up out of the ditch. In Russian: 
ZUS (a pleasant tone) Good morning, friend. Getting an early start to market? Could you possibly spare us a bit of milk? Zus' tone is belied by the rifle in his hand. 
KISSELY This is what I'm required to give the Germans. If I don't meet my quota they'll shoot me and my family. Zus is tempted to shoot him himself. 
ASAEL (to Zus) Leave half. He can't go to the Germans empty-handed. Zus glares at Asael. 
ASAEL (CONT'D) Tuvia's orders. Zus shakes his head, climbs onto the wagon and begins removing cartons.

LAZAR (V.O.) 
HALT! WHO GOES THERE! Zus shakes his head. Lazar stands, pointing his weapon. 
ZUS Lazar, you can see it's us, you idiot. You only ask, 'who goes there' when you don't know who it is. 
LAZAR Sorry, Zus. 
78 THE CAMP 78 is a beehive of activity. Shimon and Malbin are digging. 
MALBIN Even Spinoza said existence can be substantiated by empirical evidence. 
ARON If we had some dynamite we could blow the shit out of it. 
RACHEL (with undisguised 
AWE) ...Just like your brothers. Aron can't help but be pleased by this notion. Then, as the train passes, they can see HANDS gripping the small barred windows. And every now and then a gaunt, desperate FACE. They stare in astonishment.

81A UNDER A SHELTER -- CONTINUOUS 81A Tuvia sits alone. Outside, the SOUND of the violin continues. Shimon comes to sit beside him. 
SHIMON I am sorry for your loss. Tuvia nods. He is deep inside himself. 
SHIMON (CONT'D) Do you want to say the Kaddish? When at last Tuvia speaks, it is almost to himself. 
TUVIA She was a beautiful woman. But cold. Not a day went by she didn't remind me I wasn't a good provider. For years it wasn't really a marriage at all. And now... He lowers his head. All Shimon can do is sit beside him. 
82 THE PERIMETER OF THE CAMP - CONTINUOUS 82 Bella takes Chaya aside. 
BELLA You have lipstick? Please, I know you have some left. Chaya digs in her pocket and produces a tiny remnant. Bella dabs it on and casually approaches Zus, who is on guard duty. 
BELLA (O.S.) (CONT'D) May I join you? 
ZUS Of course. 
BELLA You get lonely out here? 
ZUS I like the woods. LAUGHTER and MUSIC waft through the trees. 
BELLA I'm a little scared out here. Zus knows an opportunity when he sees one. He offers her a drink from his bottle of vodka.

BELLA Why is there a rule against women having guns? 
ZUS There aren't enough for the men. 
BELLA Women need guns, too. 
ZUS What for? 
BELLA For protection. 
ZUS Women have men for protection. Bella bites her lip. She's a virgin but also realistic. 
BELLA I want protection. She steps closer and takes Zus's hand...under her coat...onto her breast...never taking her eyes off him. 
BELLA (CONT'D) You will take good care of me? You will be my commander.

84 MEANWHILE - DEEP IN THE FOREST 84 Aron and Rachel are walking back from the train tracks. Suddenly he senses movement, freezes: ARMED POLICEMEN are advancing through the trees. Aron and Rachel bury themselves beneath piles of leaves until the police pass by, then he grabs her hand and dashes 
OFF-- ARON RUNS through the woods like a deer. She follows.

MEN WITH GUNS! Chaos. People panic, search for family members, grab whatever they can carry, ZUS AND BELLA emerge from the woods where they have lain together for the first time. He grabs his rifle. TUVIA tries to maintain order. 
TUVIA 
ONLY FOOD AND GUNS! FOLLOW ASAEL! Asael clutches Chaya's hand. Rounding up others. 
ASAEL Don't panic. THIS WAY!. GO. 
ZUS 
QUIET! NOT ANOTHER WORD!!! THE POLICEMEN begin FIRING. TWO of the group are KILLED. Tuvia roughly pushes people deeper into the woods. 
TUVIA Lova, Ben Zion -- stay with us. Asael, keep them moving. Don't stop! THE POLICEMEN enter the camp. A submachine gun RAKES a shelter. KISSELY has found the escape trail into the woods. 
KISSELY This way-- 
86 THE FOREST IS DEATHLY STILL 86 Tuvia and Zus usher the group across the river and up the embankment. 
88 THE NOVEMBER WIND WHISTLES THROUGH THE BARE FOREST (MONTAGE) 88 as the group trudges along -- weighed down by cooking gear, food, guns, etc. Asael takes the iron cauldron from Chaya. Zus and Bella walk side-by-side. Pinchas leads his goat. 
MALBIN Where is he taking us? My feet are going to fall off. 
SHIMON A great rabbi once said, "wherever I go, I am always going to the land of Israel." 
MALBIN Well, maybe rabbis should give better directions. Tuvia walks alongside but apart. 
CUT TO: 
89 A HILLSIDE 89 The group is sprawled on the ground. Four people share a single cigarette. Shimon and Malbin hardly have the energy to argue. Pinchas feeds his goat. Tuvia walks among them. 
TUVIA Rest and eat. I need volunteers for a scouting party. Zus raises his hand. Tuvia nods in grudging gratitude. However mixed his feelings, Zus can always be counted on. 
CUT TO: 
90 A FORK IN THE TRAIL 90 Tuvia looks at Zus, who shrugs. They are in unfamiliar territory. As they move cautiously forward: 
A MAN IN A RED ARMY TUNIC steps into the path, holding an automatic rifle. He WHISTLES softly. More ARMED MEN materialize, surrounding them. 
GRAMOV (in Russian; subtitles) 
WHO ARE YOU? Tuvia instantly grasps the situation. He salutes. 
TUVIA (in Russian; subtitles) A brigade of independent fighters searching for our comrades.

90 CONTINUED: (2) 90 
TUVIA We belong to the Bielski otriad. 
GRAMOV We know of you. Jewish bandits. Zus's finger tightens on the trigger of his submachine gun. 
ZUS I'll take the two on the left... Tuvia maintains his composure. 
TUVIA I'm sure we can clear up this misunderstanding with your commander. 
CUT TO: 
91 THE OCTOBER OTRIAD BASE 91 A primitive tent camp. RUSSIAN PARTISANS move about, quiet and cold-eyed men wearing remnants of Red Army uniforms. Zus can't help but be impressed by the array of weaponry. VICTOR PACHENKO emerges from a tent. A former lieutenant, dashing in a fur cap and long officer's coat. He addresses them in Russian. 
VIKTOR I am Viktor Panchenko, commander of the October otriad. We have had complaints of a Jewish gang stealing from villages loyal to us. (a steely look) How do you respond to these charges? 
TUVIA When you take food it is from loyal supporters. When we do, you call it stealing. 
VIKTOR We are soldiers. 
TUVIA And we fight a common enemy. The motherland doesn't distinguish between Jews and non-Jews. Viktor is amused by this bit of Soviet dogma. 
VIKTOR But Jews do not fight. 
(CONTINUED) 
DOUBLE GREEN Revision - 10-14-07 54. 
91 CONTINUED: 91 
TUVIA These Jews do. Viktor appraises Tuvia for a moment. 
VIKTOR We will see. Select your best fighters and send them to us. Zus looks at Tuvia, knowing he has no choice. 
TUVIA We are honored to be of service. Tuvia and Zus SALUTE and head back the way they came. 
ZUS (under his breath) So we're partisans now. 
TUVIA As if we have a choice. 
CUT TO: 
91A NEW CAMP (CAMP #2) 91A Has taken root. People hard at work building zemylanka. 
92 THE NEW CAMP (CAMP #2) 92 Tuvia and Malbin are working together on a new bunker. Malbin expertly nails a header across a doorway. 
TUVIA (throwing a smaller 
HAMMER) Here. 
MALBIN If my friends at The New Socialists' Club could see me now... (shakes his head) I haven't read a book in months. 
TUVIA No. I'll bring them out myself. 
ZUS From the ghetto. 
TUVIA Yes. 
ZUS Pan Tuvia. Rabbi Tuvia. Allow me to kiss your hand... Tuvia tries to pull his hand away, but Zus holds him. 
ZUS (CONT'D) You think Pachenko wants hundreds more of us in the forest? 
TUVIA I cannot have you contradicting me... Not when others are around. (looks around) Our family must stick together.

ZUS And who is it that's risking our family, and for what? For the sake of these-- (gestures at the new 
ARRIVALS) --Malbushim. 
TUVIA Don't call them that. 
ZUS That's who comes to us from the ghetto. Empty clothes. Bloodsuckers. 
TUVIA They are people. Jews. 
ZUS Pretentious Jews. Jews who stuck up their noses and wouldn't give us the time of day when we passed them on the street. Jews who went out of their way to keep their daughters locked away from our dirty hands. 
(SAVAGELY) You think your old teacher will give you a good grade because you saved his worthless ass! They accept you as their leader only because they are too weak and full of shit to help themselves. 
TUVIA --What about Bella? Tuvia looks over at Bella, who is anxiously watching. 
TUVIA (CONT'D) --You think she'd be with you if it wasn't for what is happening here? Zus glares at him, but tries to control himself. 
TUVIA (CONT'D) --Is it love Zus? 
(CONTINUED) 
DOUBLE SALMON Revision - 10-21-07 59. 
94 CONTINUED: (3) 94 Zus is sick of talk. He PUNCHES Tuvia in the face. Tuvia is rocked but still he goads his brother. 
TUVIA (CONT'D) You are the man of her dreams? The Romeo of Novagrudok? Zus can't take anymore. He charges Tuvia, who sidesteps and SLAMS him in the gut. All the frustration of the past months, not to mention years of sibling rivalry, translates into fists and elbows. Ben Zion moves to break it up. Tuvia and Zus turn on him. 
ZUS Is this your business? Zus gains the upper hand and starts to beat the crap put of Tuvia. Finally, in desperation Tuvia rolls away and picks up a rock. He is about to slam it into his brother's head when suddenly he stops himself. The two brothers look at each other, both breathing heavily -- realizing that they have crossed some line. 
ZUS (CONT'D) (calls out) Ben Zion. Krensky. Lova. Israel. Let's go. (to Tuvia) We are going to join the real partisans. He looks at Asael. 
ZUS (CONT'D) Are you coming? Asael looks at one brother, then the other. Once again, he is in the middle. He looks at Chaya, then back at Zus. 
ASAEL No. 
ZUS Good. I'll dance at your wedding. He stops by Bella's side, touches her arm, then disappears down the trail. The others follow.

99 AN APARTMENT IN THE GHETTO - DAY 99 that might once have been home to a family-of-four now HOUSES fifteen. Tuvia and Asael are deep in conversation with several ELDERS of the ghetto Council 
ELDER #1 We are not so naive as to believe they won't kill some of us. But all the Jews? It makes no sense. They need us to work. In the factories. The labor camps. Tuvia notices A PRETTY GIRL standing on a chair in order to hear. Her name is LILKA and we will soon come to know her.

101B BACK TO TUVIA ON HORSEBACK 101B Malbin catches his eye and winks -- clearly this has been part of their "strategy" discussions. 
TUVIA Women will learn to use weapons and fight alongside men. Tuvia takes a rifle from Asael and holds it aloft. 
TUVIA (CONT'D) This is not a gun. It is Bar Kochba's spear. It is Ehud's sword. You will all learn to protect yourselves. A LITTLE BOY holds Lilka's hand and looks up at Tuvia in wonder. He cuts an iconic figure. 
(CONTINUED) 
DOUBLE GOLDENROD Revision - 10-21-07 65A. 
101B CONTINUED: 101B 
LITTLE BOY (to Lilka) He is a Jew? Lilka is equally struck -- although there is something more than wonder in her regard. She nods. 
TUVU Pregnancies are forbidden. We cannot accommodate an infant's needs. Our bunkers are overcrowded so you will have to build new ones. He looks out over the sea of expectant faces. 
TUVIA 
(CONTINUING) ...This is the one place in all of Belorussia where a Jew can be free. (looks out over them) We will make again, here in this forest, the life that was taken from you. We welcome you into our community.

101C LATER - TUVIA IS WALKING HIS HORSE BESIDE THE RIVER 101C when Riva stops him. 
RIVA You are Tuvia Bielski? You are really him? (Tuvia nods 
TENTATIVELY) You are a hero. A Maccabee. She vigorously shakes Tuvia's hand and walks away. Tuvia catches his reflection in the water. And likes it. 
102 THE CAMP AT DAWN - TO ESTABLISH 102 
102A IN AN UNDERGROUND BUNKER - DAWN 102A Lilka awakens to find TEN WOMEN wedged in beside her -- back to front -- like spoons. Idly, she begins to ITCH her scalp. Then her leg. In the pale morning light she sees that she is crawling with lice. She SCREAMS. The women around her wake up, terrified. 
LILKA Get them off! Get them off me! 
CHAYA What? Where? 
LILKA 
EVERYWHERE! OH, MY GOD, OH, MY 
GOD... 
RIVA Lice need somewhere to sleep, too. The others LAUGH, but Lilka is on the verge of hysteria. She stumbles out, stepping on several others as she goes. 
102B OUTSIDE THE BUNKER 102B Crying, she tears at her clothes -- only to discover Tuvia and OTHERS staring at her with interest. She is mortified. 
102C LATER THAT DAY 102C THE WOMEN wash clothes in the stream. Lilka is by the riverbank, scrubbing furiously. Tamara works beside her. 
TAMARA You get rid of them quicker if you boil them.

RIVA I was dreaming of shoes... 
CHAYA Shoes, Riva? 
RIVA There was a man in a shop on Grudek street... and the way he caressed my feet when I tried on his shoes... Riva swoons. The women burst into ribald laughter. The SOUND of a horse. They look to the opposite bank where: TUVIA RIDES BY on his horse. Lilka can't help but stare. 
BELLA Doesn't take a fortune teller to know what Lilka's dreaming about... Lilka blushes furiously. The women laugh even louder.

109 THE RUSSIAN WINTER (MONTAGE- MUSIC OVER) 109 SNOW covers the camp. A driving wind. Bundled in scarves, overcoats and as many layers as they can wear, Bella and Chaya break ice in a pot. Tamara takes FROZEN LAUNDRY from a line. In a bunker, Malbin and Shimon shiver under a shared blanket. Women and children stare blankly into space. Riva unwraps rags from a man's foot and examines his toes, BLACK with frostbite. Asael and Tuvia are making their rounds. They pass Aron and Rachel who have built a snowman which they top off by adding a German helmet with a bullet hole in it. 
109A IN A STORAGE AREA 109A Asael shows Tuvia the last few potatoes. 
ASAEL There is talk of returning to the ghetto. 
TUVIA Madness. 
ASAEL They've barely eaten in days. Even when our food missions manage to get through, there are armed patrols. Farmers who once helped us now guard their barns with shotguns. Tuvia considers for a moment. 
TUVIA Send out more missions. And bring shotguns. Tuvia sets off. In every face he passes, there's misery and accusation in the shivering bodies and trembling blue lips. Children stare at him with sunken, haunted eyes. 
109AA A MAKESHIFT STABLE 109AA Tuvia visits his beautiful horse. He unties him.

VIKTOR Another dead soldier! Zus looks at him, bleary-eyed, confused. Viktor explains: 
VIKTOR (CONT'D) More dead soldiers than empty bottles. 
ZUS (slurring his words) That is so...Russian. He cracks open another bottle and takes a big slug. 
VIKTOR At least you drink like one. 
ZUS 'A Jew can't drink, a Jew can't fight.' What is it we are good at, Viktor? Dying. That is what we are good at. 
VIKTOR So tell me about this brother of yours...

VIKTOR You compete with him. 
ZUS He competes with me. 
VIKTOR My older brother and I have the same relationship. 
ZUS He is a Big Shit also? 
VIKTOR A soldier. (a long moment) He was killed in the first hour of the German invasion. This sobers them up a bit. 
109F IN THE ZEMYLANKA 109F LILKA is shivering, her eyes inward and unfocused. 
TUVIA Lilka? 
LILKA Sorry, Tuvia. I was...thinking. It's nothing. He looks at her intently, knowing there's more. 
LILKA (CONT'D) ...Every time new people come into camp, I keep hoping... even though, I know... (her teeth are 
CHATTERING) ...I'm sorry. 
TUVIA Everyone here has lost someone. She looks up at him, helpless to be so revealed. 
LILKA You too?

LILKA No. Today I go on my first food mission. Tuvia's order has consigned her to this dangerous duty. 
TUVIA I will have Asael send someone else. 
LILKA No. I must go now. I want to go. She is clearly scared but desperate not to show it. He reaches into his belt and hands her a revolver. 
ZUS --So we attack the transmitter. 
VIKTOR Yes, yes, my Hebrew warrior. Except for the troops in Stankiewcze and the machine guns out front. THE TENT FLAP OPENS. Tuvia enters. He has developed a cough. 
VIKTOR (CONT'D) Two Bielski's in one room! To what do we owe this honor? 
TUVIA We have sickness. I need ampicillin. 
VIKTOR This medicine is reserved for fighters. 
TUVIA If typhus breaks out in our camp, it may spread to yours. 
VIKTOR I will have to take that chance. Zus looks from one immovable force to the other. 
TUVIA I must insist. Comrade. 
VIKTOR You'd better not. Zus is watching this dick-measuring with keen interest. 
ZUS There would be medicine in the police headquarters at Stankiewcze, yes?

ZUS Well... He looks into the back where the others wait, anxiously clutching their weapons. Tuvia tries to hold back a cough. 
ZUS (CONT'D) Stay with the truck. And make sure it's in gear when we get back. 
TUVIA I'm going in with you. 
ZUS I give the orders tonight. Across the square, the police station looms.

ZUS I have been given this mission by my superior officer. He starts to get out the cab. Tuvia reaches into his pocket, takes out the mezuzah that once blessed their parents' home. 
TUVIA Zus... (hands him the mezuzah) For luck. Zuz pockets it and joins the others creeping into the shadows. But rather than follow them into the police station, we HOLD on Tuvia's face. Suddenly we HEAR The sound of gunfire. Then nothing. Ten seconds. More gunfire. Twenty. It is excruciating. Thirty. The longest CLOSE-UP in film history. 
117 INTERCUT - FLASHES OF WHAT IS HAPPENING INSIDE... 117 Ben Zion bursts in and opens fire, killing two policemen. Krensky jumps the counter and smashes the transmitter. A policeman appears behind them on the stairs and shoots Krensky in the back. Ben Zion whirls and kills him. 
117A TUVIA WANTS TO HELP. HE PULLS HIS GUN, UNLOCKS THE DOOR. 117A 
OPENS IT. STOPS. HE HAS PROMISED TO WAIT WITH THE TRUCK. Zus, meanwhile, rummages cabinets, looking for ampicillin. 
BEN ZION Let's GO! In the back room, Zus keeps rummaging. A window EXPLODES. Ben Zion is hit. Mortally wounded, he sinks to his knees, returning fire as Zus reappears. 
118 TUVIA WATCHES 118 as Zus bursts out the door. He races to the truck and struggles into the passenger seat, BLEEDING FROM HIS

ZUS Those are my brothers. 
VIKTOR I am your brother! He is your brother! Comrade Zus. Your Jewish sentimentality is heart-warming, but counter-revolutionary. Zus has secretly known he would hear these words. He grips his rifle but holds his tongue.

SHIMON ...but the children of Israel were afraid to leave Egypt. Until Moses said, 'Do not trust in me, trust in God.' He will take care of you' (a wrenching cough) And so tomorrow we celebrate the Passover by sitting around and arguing just as we have done for centuries.

162 A RISE REVEALS THE IMMENSITY OF THE KRASNAYA GORKA SWAMP 162 Malbin stares at what lies ahead. 
MALBIN Oh, my God...

TAN Revision - 9-10-07 100A. 
162 CONTINUED: 162 
TUVIA Are the others back yet? (Malbin looks stricken; he shakes his head) ..Asael? Malbin shakes his head once more. Asael is not coming back. Chaya begins to weep. Riva comforts her. 
SHULMAN We've got to keep going! 
BELLA The Germans will be here any minute! 
MALBIN (to Tuvia) Do we wait...a while? 
MORDECAI We could hide... 
MAN #3 I say, fight them here. 
MOTL Yes. Fight! 
SHULMAN That's crazy! Tuvia is in hell. If he waits for Asael, he risks them all being caught. Suddenly it all falls apart. Tuvia sinks to his knees as if his legs can no longer bear his weight. 
MALBIN Tuvia--? Tuvia can't speak. He has no more answers. Nothing to say. He stares at the impenetrable swamp. The end of the line. The sudden vacuum of leadership is felt by them all. They stare at one another, anxious and rudderless. 
WOMAN (ZOE) My father cannot make it. 
RONA There are snakes-- Tamara's newborn is crying. She tries to comfort it. An old woman stares at the swamp in terror. 
MAN #1 (FROHMAN) The children... 
SHULMAN We'll put them on our shoulders.

BELLA Tuvia, what do we do? Oppenheim is petrified. Rona is crying. 
MALBIN 
TUVIA-- And still Tuvia is silent. More arguing. A general MURMUR of dread is rising. Malbin goes to kneel beside Shimon, who is covered in sweat -- undone by the forced march. 
MALBIN (CONT'D) What's wrong with him? 
SHIMON (fighting for breath) ...He... ..is... ..tired. Malbin hears something, looks up. 
FROM HIGH ABOVE - THE SPOTTER PLANE APPEARS They have been found. Lilka kneels beside Tuvia.

TAN Revision - 9-10-07 100B. 
162 CONTINUED: (3) 162 She takes his hand silently. 
LILKA 
COME-- He shakes his head. 
TUVIA You have a weapon? She shows him her revolver. He checks the clip, then looks into her eyes. 
TUVIA (CONT'D) Use it on yourself before you let them take you. She nods gravely. Suddenly a VOICE interrupts. 
VOICE Why are we stopping? Everyone turns. It's Asael. Back from the dead. He hands off a wounded comrade to Riva's care. 
ASAEL 
(WILD-EYED) They're coming! (to Tuvia) Why aren't we moving? Tuvia looks up at him, lost. Almost helpless. 
ASAEL (CONT'D) We must keep going! 
TAMARA In there? 
RONA It is impossible! More murmuring. Asael raises his voice. 
ASAEL Nothing is impossible! What we have done is impossible! The murmuring quiets. Asael meets Tuvia's eyes. He is literally willing his older brother to be strong for them, as he has been, time and again. 
ASAEL (CONT'D) God will not part these waters. We will do it ourselves. 
RONA But how?

165 AT NIGHTFALL - A SQUAD OF GERMAN SOLDIERS 165 sit around a campfire at the edge of the swamp. 
FROM NEARBY The LIGHTS of their fire can be seen flickering through the reeds as the ragged column MOVES SILENTLY past. 
TUVIA Not a sound. Pass the word. We watch as the ORDER is passed down the line. Parents hold hands over their childrens' mouths. Shimon is carried on an improvised litter made of branches. 
CUT TO: 
166 A FOREST CROSSROADS 166 Panchenko and a few others are on horseback. Behind them the rest of the Partisans are marching away. Zus and the Jewish fighters are on foot, awaiting orders.

DOUBLE CHERRY Revision - 11-1-07 103. 
166 CONTINUED: 166 
PANCHENKO You will hold this crossroads until the brigade has completed its retreat. Zus looks around at the position. 
ZUS For how long? Panchenko's orders are never to be questioned. 
PANCHENKO Until you are ordered to withdraw. 
ZUS And if we cannot hold the position? Panchenko looks at Gramov, who stands nearby cradling a submachine gun. 
PANCHENKO Comrade Gramov will enforce discipline, if necessary. Gramov smiles. The implications are clear: nobody retreats. 
PANCHENKO (CONT'D) You have served us well, Comrade. 
ZUS (a wintry smile) I am so honored, Comrade. Panchenko wheels his horse and gallops off. Zus and his men take cover in the woods. In the distance we can HEAR the unmistakable SOUND of approaching armor. Lova kneels beside Zus. 
LOVA What are we doing here? Zus? Half a mile down the road, A TANK rumbles into view. 
LOVA (CONT'D) Tell me. Who are we doing this for? With a shaking hand, Zus tries to light a Molotov cocktail but his matches are wet. He reaches into his pocket for more. Instead he finds the mezuzah that was once affixed to his family's door. As he stares at it, the SOUND of the approaching tank grows louder.

167 THE KRASNAYA GORKA SWAMP 167 empties at last into a shallow river. On the opposite bank is dry land, and beyond, the deep forest. And safety. The bedraggled group makes their way across. 
168 OMITTED 168

GREEN Revision - 8-8-07 106-106A. 
169 ON THE OPPOSITE BANK 169 Asael pulls people up onto dry ground. They lie there, freezing and exhausted. Some cannot control their shivering. 
SHULMAN What's next...Sinai? Tuvia can't help but laugh. Soon they are all laughing. It ripples throughout the group. Joyous. Contagious. An overwhelming feeling of relief. They are safe. Tuvia lies on the ground. All the adrenaline has suddenly left his body. Then Aron appears, tugging at his sleeve. Shimon is asking for him. Tuvia kneels down beside his teacher, whose eyes are closed. Malbin is weeping quietly. Who will he argue with? 
SHIMON (a whisper) .Tuvia... 
TUVIA Right here. Shimon is at the end. 
SHIMON ...Something...to say... 
TUVIA Shhhh... 
SHIMON ...no...please... (finding the strength) I almost lost...my faith....but you...were sent..by God..to save us. 
TUVIA Ridiculous. 
SHIMON I know... ... But just...in case... .I thank....HIM... .and I thank you. He closes his eyes. It's too much for Tuvia. Hard as he tries, he cannot stop the tears from filling his eyes.

170 SUDDENLY -- UP THE RIVERBANK 170 Trees begin to FALL OVER -- as if pushed by a dinosaur. 
A PANZER TANK emerges onto the banks, less than a quarter-of-mile away. 
ITS TURRET BEGINS TO SWIVEL The menacing gun turning in their direction. 
171 THE GROUP IS CAUGHT OUT IN THE OPEN. 171 THE TANK ROARS FIRE. The first round EXPLODES among them. Several are killed. 
TUVIA Back to the river! He pushes people down. They cling to the banks, cowering. THOSE WITH WEAPONS take cover, using the embankment as if it were the lip of a trench. They RETURN FIRE -- old men, young women, even some children. 
172 A SQUAD OF GERMAN INFANTRY ADVANCES 172 behind the tank, using it as protection. Aron kills one. But the Germans are well-trained. They direct a withering fire -- forcing the partisans to keep their heads below the embankment. 
BUT THE TANK IS UNSTOPPABLE It turns its attentions on the riverbank -- its first round SAILS OVERHEAD, sending up a huge geyser of water. But the next round PLOWS INTO THE EARTH, tearing a huge chunk of earth and killing two of the brigade. TUVIA grabs a satchel and begins filling it with grenades. He throws the satchel over Malbin's head, grabs his arm and races, crouching low, beneath the lip of the riverbank. Asael provides covering fire. So do Lilka, Chaya and the women alongside the men. 
UP AHEAD A stand of trees hides Tuvia from view as he climbs out of the river and heads into the forest. He pulls Malbin down just as A SQUAD OF GERMAN INFANTRY approaches and begins to set up a heavy machine gun.

GREEN Revision - 8-8-07 107A. 
172 CONTINUED: 172 Tuvia POPS UP behind them, spraying them with his submachine gun. He then turns the heavy machine gun on the infantry advancing behind the tank -- to devastating effect. But now, the tank turns its attention to Tuvia. Its machine gun begins to chew up the forest, forcing Tuvia to take cover. Without pausing to think, Malbin grabs a grenade from the satchel and races toward the tank. It falls pitifully short, exploding harmlessly as Malbin is cut down.

SEQ. 125 - ALONE IN THE WORLD 
DARKNESS 
JACK (V.O.) Darkness. That's the first thing I remember. It was dark, and it was cold. And I was scared. 
The silhouette of a body appears as it drifts into a ray of light, refracted through water, which turns into... 
A MOON - SEEN IN REFLECTION ON A SHEET OF ICE 
The moonlight intensifies almost magically, and the ice above begins to spider-web and crack. 
EXT. FROZEN POND - NIGHT 
Snow-covered trees in every direction. The ice in the pond continues to crack, until finally a hole splinters open. A young man floats out of the water, bathed in the intense moonlight. This is JACK FROST - thin, pale, barefoot, his tousled hair frosted white. 
JACK (V.O.) But then...then I saw the moon. It was so big and it was so bright, and it seemed to chase the darkness away. And when it did...I wasn't scared anymore. 
Jack floats back down onto the ice as the hole closes up underneath him. JACK (V.O.) Why I was there, and what I was meant to do - that I've never known. And a part of me wonders if I ever will. 
Jack looks around, confused, then turns toward the moonlight as it dims a bit. 
Jack carefully treads across the ice until he hits something with his feet. He looks down, and at his feet is a wooden staff. Curious, he picks it up. Almost immediately the staff begins to glow a cold blue in his hands. Odd. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 2. 
Jack almost drops it as the base of the staff comes in contact with the ground. Frost shoots out and spreads across the ice. Jack is visibly confused. 
He touches a few trees with his staff sending frost up their trunks. Then he swings the staff again, more confident, as he begins to run across the frozen pond. 
Another swing, and a gust of wind swirls him high up into the air. Jack floats for a moment only to fall back down to earth and into the trees. Jack grabs hold of a tree branch and pulls himself up to see a small town off in the distance. 
EXT. BURGESS SETTLEMENT - TOWN CENTER - CONTINUOUS 
A collection of simple timber houses with thatched roofs. Jack comes in for a landing, and it's a rocky one. He stands up, still elated, and brushes himself off. 
As Jack makes his way into town, settlers are warming their hands by campfire. Jack doesn't recognize anyone. 
JACK (to the townsfolk) Hello. Hello. Good evening, ma'am. (BEAT) Ma'am? 
The settlers walk past Jack, not noticing him. Jack crouches down as a YOUNG BOY runs toward him. 
JACK Oh, ah, excuse me, can you tell me where I am? 
The boy runs right through Jack, as if he were a ghost. Jack staggers back in shock. He's speechless, as if the wind had been knocked out him. His emotions causing it to snow. 
JACK Hello! Hello! 
Townsfolk continue to pass through Jack, unaware of his presence. Shaken, Jack turns and retreats into the forest. 
JACK (V.O.) My name is Jack Frost -- how do I know that? The moon told me so. But that was all he ever told me. And that was a long, long time ago. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 3. 
We pan up as the moon shines down over the snow covered trees.

SEQ. 175 - INTRO TO NORTH 
EXT. NORTH POLE - DUSK 
FIERY GYPSY VIOLIN MUSIC as we move through clouds to reveal a MASSIVE ICE CANYON, and just around a bend, the incredible hidden fortress of NORTH, aka SANTA CLAUS. 
INT. NORTH'S WORKSHOP - DUSK 
We glimpse a familiar-looking RED JACKET and CAP with white trim on a coat hanger just as a pair of tongs SLAM a block of ice onto a stone work table-- 
IN QUICK CUTS: A CHAINSAW shears the block in half, spraying ice. North lifts up the chainsaw revealing a massive tatoo on his arm, the word NAUGHTY clearly visible. 
Three ELVES huddle in a doorway around a plate of cookies, each licking their own tasty morsel. 
NORTH (O.S.) Still waiting for cookies! 
As North crosses the background, the elves lower the cookies from their mouths, their faces frozen in fear. 
The elves duck out of the way as North launches himself across the floor on his rolling chair -- CLOSE as his huge HAND gropes furiously among his WORK TOOLS, finally grabbing a miniature HAMMER. As North's humming along with his music, delicately CHISELING into the ice, we see a second arm sleeve tatoo, the word NICE clearly visible-- 
His INTENSE BLUE EYE magnified in a JEWELER'S EYEPIECE -- a delicate SCULPTING TOOL cuts fine details into the ice-- 
His hands place the finished piece on a curving ICE TRACK: An ice LOCOMOTIVE. It belches ice vapor and chugs down the track, picking up speed-- 
NORTH Yes! 
North's hand grabs a cookie from a plate held up by the two Elves. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 4. 
One of the elves gives his cohort a look and points to the plate as it chews with a mouth full of food, to which it then unfurls its tongue and lets the half eaten morsels spill out onto the plate. 
NORTH Ah, finally! 
He takes a bite and leans toward the ice track. He chuckles as the train hits a loop, and launches off a ramp into midair -- then WINGS unfold -- JET ENGINES sprout and ignite and the train lifts off the track-- 
Suddenly, the DOOR is thrown open by one of North's concerned YETIS, sending the flying ice locomotive skidding across the floor in pieces. 
YETI Arghbal... 
Much of this we hear over the following... 
INT. EGG TUNNEL 
A few EASTER EGGS pop up out of the ground; their little legs carry them out of the way of a fast approaching object. 
Speeding along through a subterranean tunnel, we can barely keep up with a DIMLY-LIT FIGURE as it races at blinding speed, leaping and zigzagging through a series of TUNNELS -- 
EXT. A SNOWY EXPANSE IN THE NORTH POLE 
A hole opens in the snow, and a pair of rabbit ears pops out. A huge rabbit climbs out and brushes off the snow, annoyed. The six foot tall figure is BUNNYMUND. 
BUNNYMUND Ah, it's freezing. 
He shivers with cold, then goes slogging through the snow. 
BUNNYMUND (CONT'D) I can't feel my feet! I can't feel my feet! 
In the distance is North's ornately decorated and dimly lit palace built into the side of a mountain of ice.

SEQ. 250 - THE CEREMONY 
INT. GLOBE ROOM - NIGHT 
Sandy's biplane circles the massive chamber, leaving trails of Dreamsand. 
NORTH (O.S.) Cookies? Eggnog, anyone? 
BUNNYMUND (O.S.) Oh, this better be good, North. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 9. 
TOOTH (O.S.) (to her fairies) Montreal, sector six: ten premolars, eight incisors and twelve canines. Steer clear of the wild goose migration. 
NORTH Sandy, thank you for coming. 
Sandy descends from the plane and floats to the ground. He joins North, Bunny and Tooth as they walk through the Globe Room. Sand glyphs appear above Sandy's head communicating that he is busy and has a lot of work to do. 
NORTH (TO SANDY) I know, I know, but I obviously wouldn't have called you all here unless it was serious. 
North, Bunny, Tooth and Sandy reach the center of the room. Tooth does her best to shush her mini-fairies. 
NORTH (CONT'D) The Boogie Man was here - at the Pole. 
North points to the globe. The other Guardians turn to look. 
TOOTH (SHOCKED) Pitch? Pitch Black? Here?! 
NORTH Yes! There was black sand covering the globe. 
BUNNYMUND (CONFUSED) What, what...what do you mean black sand? 
NORTH And then a shadow! 
BUNNYMUND Hold on, hold on, I thought you said you saw Pitch. 
NORTH Well, ah, not exactly... Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 10. 
BUNNYMUND Not exactly? Can you believe this guy? 
Bunny turns to Sandy, who shrugs while forming a Dreamsand question mark above his head. 
BUNNYMUND Yeah, you said it, Sandy. 
Bunny goes back to painting one of his Easter eggs. 
NORTH Look, he is up to something very bad. I feel it, in my belly. 
BUNNYMUND (his eyes narrow) Hang on, hang on, you mean to say, you summoned me here THREE DAYS BEFORE EASTER - because of your belly? Mate, if I did this to you three days before Christmas-- 
TOOTH (to her fairies) Argentina. Priority alert! A batch of bicuspids in Buenos Aires. 
NORTH Please. Bunny. Easter is not Christmas. 
BUNNYMUND Here we go... 
North grabs Bunny's painted egg, casually juggling it in his hand as he walks off. Meanwhile Sandy, who is being served eggnog by a yeti, suddenly notices something high above. 
BUNNYMUND (O.S.) (LAUGHS) North, I, I don't have time for this. I've still got two million eggs to finish up. 
The moon rises into view, high up in the ceiling; its rays of light begin to shine brightly through as they cascade down the walls of the globe room. 
NORTH (O.S.) No matter how much you paint, is still egg! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 11. 
Sandy points to the moon unsuccessfully to get the others' attention. 
BUNNYMUND Look, mate, I'm dealing with perishables. Right. You've got all year to prepare. 
TOOTH (to her fairies) Pittsburg, boy eight, two molars. Saltwater taffy. 
Sandy puts his fingers in his mouth to whistle, a silent musical note forming above his head. 
NORTH (TO BUNNY) Why are rabbits always so nervous. 
BUNNYMUND And why are you always such a blowhard! 
TOOTH (O.S.) (to her fairies) Ontario, sector nine: five canines, two molars, and fourteen incisors. Is that all in one house? 
Sandy waves a sand flag above his head, pointing and jumping up and down as the moonlight continues to fill the room. 
PEDESTRIAN #1 (O.S.) Is that Jamie Bennett? 
JAMIE Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... 
PEDESTRIAN #2 (O.S.) Hey! Watch it! 
JACK There you go! 
JAMIE No! No! 
PEDESTRIAN #3 (O.S.) Look at that dude! 
Jamie flies off the sidewalk and back into the middle of the street, almost knocking over a postman. As Jack flies by Jamie's side he sees the look of excitement come into Jamie's face. Jack smiles, knowing he's responsible. 
Jack sees an oncoming snowplow and quickly jumps ahead, carried by the wind, to divert the ice trail. 
JACK Whoa. 
Jamie's sled suddenly turns, narrowly missing the oncoming truck and barrels toward Jack's newly formed ice ramp... 
JAMIE AAAAHHHHHHHH! 
Jamie closes his eyes as the ramp launches Jamie over the street, high into the air, and toward the statue of Thaddeus Burgess, colonial settler - 1680. Jamie's friends stand in awe, mouths wide open, as he sails through the air. 
Jamie opens his eyes and the look of fear suddenly turns to joy. Jack looks on smiling. 
Jamie lands safely in a large mound of snow. Jack jumps onto the Statue of Thaddeus Burgess. 
PIPPA (O.S.) Oh my gosh! 
JACK Yeah! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 23. 
Jamie's friends all come running to Jamie's aide, scared. But Jamie gets up. 
KIDS (WALLA) Wow, that looks serious! Jamie! Jamie, are you alright? Is he okay? 
JAMIE Whoaaa! Did you guys see that? It was amazing! I slid - I did a jump and I slid under a car­-ERF!! 
A sofa from the moving van suddenly knocks Jamie down... 
JACK Whoops. 
KIDS (CRINGING) Ooooh! 
There's a moment of silence as the kids wait to see if Jamie is okay. Then, Jamie rises up from behind the sofa grinning, a new gap in his smile. He holds up a tooth. 
JAMIE Cool! A Tooth! 
KIDS (WALLA) Dude, that means cash! Tooth Fairy cash! I love the Tooth Fairy! 
JACK (his fun cut short) Oh, no... 
KIDS (WALLA) That's totally awesome. You lucky bug! Lucky! 
JACK No! 
JAMIE I gotta put this under my pillow! 
KIDS (WALLA) I wish I lost my tooth. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 24. 
JACK Ah, wait a minute! Come on, hold on, hold on! What about all that fun we just had? That wasn't the Tooth Fairy, that was me! 
KIDS (WALLA) I lost two teeth in one day once - remember that?! What are you gonna spend your money on? What are you gonna buy? How much do you think she's going to leave? 
As Jack looks down from the statue his frustration grows. Storm clouds overhead rumble and darken. Flurries of snow begin to intensify. 
KIDS (WALLA) Let's go...I'm cooold! My ears are freezing. I can't feel my toes. Ah, it's hot cocoa time. 
Jack jumps down from the statue, trying to engage the kids. But it's too late, the kids take off. Jack blocks Jamie's way as the boy comes running at him. 
JACK What's a guy gotta do to get a little attention around here! 
WHOOOSH! Jamie runs through Jack, as if he where a ghost. Jack is left momentarily shaken, then... 
CUPCAKE (walla; mocking her FRIENDS) "Oh, I'm cold, I'm cold, I'm co- old." 
KIDS (O.S.) (WALLA) Somebody take a picture. Hey, stop! That was really awesome. 
They're gone. Jack is alone again. His temper subsides. 
He whips up a little wind and disappears. 
CUT TO: Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 25. 
SEQ. 700 - NIGHT FALLS IN TOWN 
INT. JAMIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Jamie plays with a TOY ROBOT as DRAWINGS AND CHARTS of mystery creatures hang on the wall behind him: UFO's, aliens, Bigfoot, you name it. There's even a drawing of Jamie flying in midair on his sled. 
JAMIE (O.S.) ...I did this jump and it was amazing and I slide under a car and it was awesome! Then I was flying down this hill and I was like whoosh, whoosh, whoosh through all these cars, and then the sled hit this, this thing, and I was like way up in the air. 
He mimes flying in the air with his robot, then CRASHING to the bed as Sophie and their dog sit listening-- 
JAMIE -- and then BAM! The sofa hit me, and, and see? (opens mouth, tries to say `my tooth came out!) Ah hoo hay ow! 
We reveal JAMIE'S MOM in the room. Sophie LAUGHS and tries to stick a finger in the gap in his gums. 
JAMIE'S MOM Alright you, tooth under your pillow? 
BUNNYMUND (CONT'D) But this is about something else. (BEAT) Fellas... 
Before Jack realizes what's happening a HUGE HAND reaches into frame and lifts him off his feet. 
JACK Hey! 
YETI Durbha wahla. 
Jack has been snatched up by two huge YETIS. 
JACK Put me down! What the... 
Jack is shoved head first into a sack. A yeti whips out a snow globe, and smashes it on the ground. 
YETI Durtal bardla burdlew. 
A MAGIC PORTAL opens in front of them. The yetis make way for Bunny to leap in, but he demurs -- 
YETI Dwbard urghwetee. 
BUNNYMUND Me? (LAUGHS) Not on your nelly. See you back at the pole. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 30. 
He STAMPS HIS FOOT twice on the ground which SWIRLS OPEN -- a RABBIT HOLE magically appears. Bunny leaps into it and disappears along with the rabbit hole. In its place, from out of the ground grows a small green plant. 
YETIS Bwardla arghl. 
The yetis throw Jack through the magic portal. 
JACK Ahhhhhhhhh! 
The yetis then charge in after and disappear into the portal.

SEQ. 900 - JACK MEETS GUARDIANS 
INT. NORTH'S LIBRARY - DAY 
TOOTH (O.S.) (to a fairy) Tangiers! Incivie du haut, 421 rue de Barat! Allez! 
The sack flies out of the portal and lands on the floor. In the darkness, Jack hears -- 
NORTH (O.S.) He's here. 
Jack struggles out of the sack to see two elves staring at him. 
TOOTH (to another fairy) Walla Walla, Washington. We've got a trampoline mishap at 1340 Ginger Lane. 
NORTH Quiet. 
He then looks up to see North and Sandman looking down at him. The Tooth Fairy is surrounded by a dozen hovering tiny fairies who come and go as she blurts out orders. 
T0OTH (CONT'D) Canine, lateral and central incisor. Ouch! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 31. 
North clears his throat. They all turn to a bewildered Jack. 
NORTH Hey, there he is! Jack Frost! 
As North holds out his arms to welcome Jack, a Dreamsand snowflake appears above Sandy's head. 
JACK Wow, you gotta be kidding me. 
Two Yetis suddenly grab Jack by the shoulders and lift him up onto his feet. 
JACK Hey, hey. Whoa, put me down. 
NORTH I hope the yetis treated you well? 
JACK Oh, yeah. I love being shoved in a sack and tossed through a magic portal. 
NORTH Oh, good! That was my idea! You know Bunny, obviously. 
JACK Obviously. 
Bunny stands off to the side, grumbling with his arms crossed. Jack suddenly notices the MINI TOOTH FAIRIES hovering near him, staring and twittering. 
NORTH And the Tooth Fairy? 
Before Jack can answer, she's gliding toward him. 
TOOTH Hello, Jack. I've heard a lot about you. And your teeth. 
JACK My, my what? 
TOOTH (moves in way too close) Open up! Are they really as white as they say? Yes! (GASP) (MORE) Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 32. TOOTH (CONT'D) Oh, they really do sparkle like freshly fallen snow. 
Several swooning Mini Teeth flutter around a confused Jack, batting their lashes and screaming like crazed Beatles fans. Tooth collects herself, and... 
TOOTH Girls, pull yourselves together... Let's not disgrace the uniform. 
NORTH And Sandman. (sees Sandy is snoozing) Sandy! Sandy! Wake up! 
Sandy bolts up awake and steps up to Jack, smiling. 
JACK Hey! Ho! Anyone wanna tell me why I'm here? 
The WISP OF DREAMSAND above Sandy's head morphs into a BARRAGE OF IMAGES. 
JACK That's not really helping. But thanks, little man. (TO OTHERS) I musta done something really bad to get you four together. 
JACK Uhh, you ever hear of a snow day? I know it's no hard-boiled egg, but kids like what I do. 
BUNNYMUND But none of 'em believe in you. (leans in to him) Do they? You see, you're invisible, mate. It's like you don't even exist. 
TOOTH Bunny! Enough! 
Silence. Jack tries not to look stung by this. 
JACK No, the kangaroo's right. 
BUNNYMUND (GLARES) The, the what -- what'd you call me? I am not a kangaroo, mate. 
JACK Oh. And this whole time I thought you were. If you're not a kangaroo, what are you? 
BUNNYMUND I'm a bunny. The Easter Bunny. People believe in me. 
Sandy nudges North, who acknowledges the tension in the air. 
NORTH (TO JACK) Jack. Walk with me. 
CUT TO: Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 37. 
SEQ. 1000 - NORTH'S WORKSHOP 
INT. TOY FACTORY - NORTH POLE - DAY 
Jack and North ride an elevator, bearing the resemblance of a Christmas ornament, down to the factory floor. 
JACK It's nothing personal, North. What you all do, it's just, it's not my thing. 
NORTH Man in Moon says it is your thing. We will see! 
North storms through factory floor, Jack trying to keep up. An amazing place. 
JACK Slow down, wouldja? I've been trying to bust in here for years, I want a good look. 
NORTH (peeved - still rushing) What do you mean, "bust in?" 
JACK Oh, don't worry, I never got past the yetis. 
Jack looks over his shoulder; an angry yeti pounds his fist into his palm. 
YETI Rwwarrrrrr. 
JACK Oh, hey Phil. 
NORTH Keep up, Jack! Keep up! 
North charges ahead. 
North's factory is bustling with activity: Yeti's are building toys, moving packages, while Elves are test piloting the various flying toys. 
As Jack walks behind North, surveying the factory, a duck toy suddenly flies over Jack's head. Jack ducks just in time and continues after North. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 38. 
JACK Whoa! (BEAT) I always thought the elves made the toys. 
NORTH (WHISPERS) We just let them believe that. 
Jack looks over to see a group of elves eating Christmas ornaments and another electrocuting himself with Christmas lights. North smiles and calls to them. 
NORTH Very nice! Keep up good work! 
North continues through the factory floor. He passes a yeti putting the finishing touches on a blue toy robot. 
NORTH (TO YETI) I don't like it. Paint it red. 
The yeti reacts in dismay as we reveal hundreds of finished blue robots. 
NORTH Step it up, everybody. 
As North and Jack move to the opposite end of the chamber, we finally glimpse the orchestrated chaos of the entire workshop, in all it's magic and splendor. 
INT. NORTH'S OFFICE - A MOMENT LATER 
Jack follows North into his office. There are shelves filled with toys. Sketches and prototypes everywhere. 
North dusts his hands and turns to Jack. His sleeves are rolled. Jack notices that on one of North's forearms is tattooed the word NAUGHTY, and on the other, NICE. North grabs a plate from a nearby elf. 
NORTH Fruit cake? 
JACK Ah, no, thanks. 
North hurls it - crash! A pause as North looks at Jack. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 39. 
NORTH Now we get down to tacks of brass! 
JACK (TO HIMSELF) Tacks of brass? 
As North cracks his knuckles, Jack stands silent. The wind suddenly slams North's office door behind them. Jack looks to the door, it locks itself, and he turns back. North moves in close to Jack, backing him up against the door. 
NORTH Who are you, Jack Frost? What is your center? 
North pokes Jack in the chest. 
JACK My center? 
NORTH If Man in Moon chose you to be a Guardian, you must have something very special inside. 
North stands up straight and begins to stroke his beard as he gives Jack a curious look. 
NORTH Out of the way! 
The sleigh heads down a luge-like track. North and Jack are enjoying the ride. 
NORTH Hyah! 
BUNNYMUND Ohhhhhh no! 
North cracks the reigns, the sleigh plummets, an almost vertical drop. Sandy grins calmly. Jack loves this. Bunnymund - not so much. 
BUNNYMUND (WALLA) Slow down, slow down! 
North pulls a lever, kicking the sleigh into overdrive. He looks back as the sleigh enters a corkscrew. 
NORTH I hope you like the loopty loops! 
BUNNYMUND (NAUSEOUS) I hope you like carrots. 
NORTH Here we go! 
WIDE SHOT as the sleigh reaches the bottom of the ramp, and shoots upwards, launching them into bright blue sky. 
JACK WOOO-HOOOOOO!!!!!! 
EXT. SLEIGH - FLYING THROUGH THE SKY - CONTINUOUS 
North, reins in hand, leans into the wind as the reindeer climb higher. 
NORTH Klasno! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 44. 
Jack, in his element, leaps up onto the rear of the sleigh to watch the North Pole fade into the distance. 
JACK (LAUGHS) Whoa! 
Bunnymund peaks off the side of the sleigh, then leans back, and holds on for dear life. 
JACK Hey, Bunny-- 
Bunny turns to see Jack standing on the back edge of the sleigh. 
JACK Check out this view-- EEEYAAAAGGHGHH! 
Jack is SWEPT OFF the sleigh and disappears! Bunny gasps in horror and looks over the side...only to see Jack lounging on the sleigh's skid. 
JACK Awww...you do care. 
BUNNYMUND Ah, rack off you bloody show pony! 
Bunny glowers as Jack makes his way back into the sleigh. 
NORTH Hold on everyone, I know a shortcut. 
BUNNYMUND Oh strewth, I knew we should have taken the tunnels. 
North holds a snow globe up to his face. 
NORTH I say, Tooth Palace. 
An image of the Tooth Palace appears inside the snowglobe. North throws the globe into the air and a giant vortex opens. 
NORTH Hyah! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 45. 
EXT. SKY - SLEIGH JETTING THROUGH THE SKY 
A surreal light surrounds the sleigh as it hits HYPERDRIVE and gets sucked through the snow-globe portal with a WHOOSH. 
CUT TO: 
SEQ. 1300 - TOOTH PALACE DESTROYED 
EXT. SKY - NEAR TOOTH'S PALACE 
The sleigh suddenly comes out of HYPERDRIVE at the outskirts of the Tooth Palace. Streaks of black rapidly approaching. 
NORTH What!? 
Suddenly our heroes find themselves in the midst of mayhem, as hundreds of Nightmares and terrified Tooth Fairies jet past. It's like a meteor storm. North yanks the reins, and the sleigh veers sharply, dodging the oncoming Nightmares. 
NORTH What are they!? 
Sandy and Bunny duck the onslaught. 
BUNNYMUND Whoa! 
Jack now sees that the Nightmares are actually GULPING DOWN the fleeing fairies and flying off with them. It's chaos. 
JACK They're taking the tooth fairies! 
Jack looks up to see a lone fairy with a Nightmare snapping at its heels. Jack leaps into the air and rescues it before the Nightmare can snatch it away. 
Jack lands back in the sleigh. He opens his hand to reveal Baby Tooth, who's shaking with fear. 
JACK Hey little Baby Tooth, you okay? 
As Baby Tooth nods, North steers the sleigh forward through the storm toward the entrance of Tooth's Palace. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 46. 
INT. TOOTH PALACE - A MOMENT LATER 
A vast chamber supported by pillars containing millions of tiny wooden deposit boxes from floor to ceiling. North spots a Nightmare up ahead and hands Jack the reigns. 
THOOMP -- she smacks into a TOOTHPASTE BILLBOARD. 
TOOTH Ow! 
Jack jumps up to the billboard to check on her. 
JACK Ah, you okay? 
TOOTH Fine...sorry, it's been a really long time since I've been out in the field. 
JACK How long is a long time? 
TOOTH Ah, four hundred forty years...give or take. 
Tooth jerks to attention: suddenly her VIEW ZOOMS IN thru a LITTLE GIRL'S BEDROOM WINDOW: a tiny GLOW under her pillow marks a freshly planted TOOTH. 
Tooth gasps and her eyes go wide -- she FLIES to the window, excited. Jack reacts, looks to Baby Tooth: it's gonna be a long night. 
JACK Hmm... 
INT. BOY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Jack, cocksure, arrives outside an open window. His smile suddenly disappears when he sees a RABBIT HOLE open up in the bedroom floor and Bunny hops out. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 57. 
EXT. BOY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 
Bunny, now holding the tooth in his paw, turns to Jack and laughs. Jack, not amused, zaps Bunny with burst of frost from his staff. 
BUNNYMUND (O.S.) Aaahhh! 
EXT. MIDDLE EAST - NIGHT 
The Guardians fly over a Middle Eastern city in North's sleigh as the full moon lights up the night sky.

INT. BOY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Bunny pulls out his hand from under a pillow revealing SEVERAL TEETH.

Pull out wider to reveal HOCKEY TROPHIES, POSTERS and PARAPHERNALIA EVERYWHERE. Bunny grins. 
BUNNYMUND Looks like you're a bit of a brumby, hey mate. 
INT. BOY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
North stands at the side of a boy's bed. 
NORTH (LAUGHS) Is piece of pie! 
He falls into a rabbit hole, finding himself face to face with Bunny. He growls. SANDMAN enters and takes the boy's tooth for himself. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 58. 
BUNNYMUND Ow! 
NORTH (LOUD WHISPER) That's my tooth! Sandy! Sandy! 
EXT. BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Jack parkours between two buildings and into a window. 
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 
Jack flies in through the window when suddenly, a rabbit hole appears. As Jack disappears through the rabbit hole, Bunny appears through an adjacent hole laughing to himself. 
INT. BEDROOM NIGHT 
Tooth reaches under a pillow and pulls out a Tooth with a mouse attached to the other end. Baby Tooth tackles the mouse. 
TOOTH Whoa, whoa, whoa! Take it easy there, champ! He's one of us! Part of the European division. (to the mouse) Ca va? 
The mouse gestures back angrily. 
EXT. SKYLINE - NIGHT 
North and the Guardians, riding North's sleigh, exit a wormhole. North laughs as they fly over the city. 
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Bunny pulls a note from under a pillow instead of a tooth. 
BUNNYMUND Huh? 
The note shows an arrow, pointing toward the window. He looks up to the window: North holds up a tooth as he grins, then leaps off the ledge laughing. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 59. 
EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT 
Bunny lands on a rooftop, holding a tooth in his paw, and proud of himself. Then, Bunny hears the sound of ice and FROST-- 
BUNNYMUND Crikey! 
--and disappears from view. Bunny is now sliding down the side of a roof on a sheet of ice. Jack grabs the tooth from Bunny's paw as he slides past and holds it high in the air. 
JACK (LAUGHS) Yes! 
A beat; Jack sees how much it means to her. 
JACK It's a little different up close, huh? 
Tooth gives him a look: he's right. 
TOOTH Thanks for being here, Jack. I wish I had known about your memory, I could've helped you. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 63. 
JACK Yeah, well, look let's just get you taken care of. Then it's Pitch's turn, huh? 
A sudden COMMOTION. They both turn to the window. 
NORTH Here you are! 
North, carrying a large sack over his shoulder, struggles to climb in through the small window. Sandman and Baby Tooth climb in after. Everybody whispers. 
TOOTH SSHHHHHHHH!! 
NORTH Oh, what gives slowpokes!? 
Jamie is still sound asleep. 
NORTH How you feeling, Toothy? 
TOOTH Believed in. 
NORTH (LAUGHS) Haha! That's what I want to hear. 
BUNNYMUND (O.S.) Oh I see how it is... 
Bunny comes in through a rabbit hole in the floorboards. 
BUNNYMUND (CONT'D) All working together to make sure the rabbit gets last place. 
North now holds his index fingers up to his lips. 
NORTH SSSHHHHHHHHH!!! 
JACK You think I need help to beat a bunny? Check it out, Peter Cottontail. 
Jack lifts up his sack of teeth. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 64. 
BUNNYMUND You call that a bag of choppers? (lifting larger sack) Now that's a bag of choppers. 
NORTH Gentlemen! Gentlemen! This is about Tooth. It's not a competition! But if it was -- (reveals even larger sack) I win. YEEEEEHAAAHH! 
And he strikes a Russian dancing pose as... 
Suddenly a bright circle of light is cast on the Guardians. 
NORTH (CONT'D) Oh no... 
JAMIE (O.C.) (SURPRISED) Santa Claus? 
They all turn slowly to see Jamie sitting up in bed, holding a flashlight, wide awake and beaming in disbelief. 
JAMIE (CONT'D) The Easter Bunny?...Sandman...The Tooth Fairy! I knew you'd come! 
TOOTH Surprise! (GIGGLING) We came! 
JACK He can see us? 
Jamie looks around, amazed, he sees everyone but Jack. 
BUNNYMUND Most of us. 
TOOTH Shhh! You guys, he's still awake. 
BUNNYMUND Sandy! Knock him out! 
They all look to him, scandalized. Jamie looks concerned. 
JAMIE Huh? Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 65. 
BUNNYMUND With the Dreamsand, ya gumbies. 
But then Jamie's GREYHOUND rises up into frame, fully awake, its nostrils flaring at the scent he's picked up. 
JAMIE No, stop that's the Easter Bunny. What are you doing, Abbey? Down! 
The dog is nose to nose with Bunnymund. 
BUNNYMUND Alright, nobody panic. 
JACK (ENJOYING THIS) But that's a um, that's a greyhound. Do you know what greyhounds do to rabbits? 
BUNNYMUND I think it's a pretty safe bet he's never met a rabbit like me - 
While Sandy forms a Dreamsand baseball, Jack rolls his eyes and notices an alarm clock on the bedside table. 
BUNNYMUND (CONT'D) Six foot one, nerves of steel, master of tai-chi and the ancient ART OF-- 
Jack can't resist: he reaches over stealthily and SETS OFF THE ALARM CLOCK with his staff. RRRRRIIIIING! 
BUNNYMUND Crikey. 
Bunny is off like a shot, the greyhound right on his tail, running laps in the small room, the dog barking like crazy. 
JAMIE Stop! Sit! 
The Nightmare then veers up the wall of the alley and onto a ROOFTOP. Jack whips a blast from his staff and HITS the Nightmare before it disappears from view. 
JACK (JAZZED) HAAAH! I got it! 
Jack jumps up onto the roof and prods the frozen Nightmare with his staff. 
JACK Sandy! Sandy, did you see that?!? Look at this thing! 
Jack can barely contain his excitement as he calls out to Sandy -- but suddenly Pitch lurches out from behind an air conditioning unit on the rooftop. 
PITCH Frost? 
Jack blasts a WAVE OF FROST across the rooftop, but Pitch easily dodges it, reappearing behind Jack on the adjoining rooftop. 
PITCH You know, for a "neutral party" you spend an awful lot of time with those weirdos. (BEAT) This isn't your fight, Jack. 
Jack's eyes narrow. He holds out his staff, ready to strike. 
JACK You made it my fight when you stole those teeth. 
Pitch regards him curiously. 
PITCH Teeth? Why do you care about the teeth? 
When he notices something and turns to find Sandy calmly standing on the rooftop next to him. Pitch quickly sidesteps, moving away from Sandy. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 70. 
PITCH (CHUCKLING) Now this is who I'm looking for-- 
Before Pitch can finish a DREAMSAND STREAM whips around him, forcing him to duck and dodge Sandy's sudden attack. 
PITCH Whoa--?? 
Pitch DISPERSES a stream of NIGHTMARE SAND, turning it into a gigantic sickle and swings it back at Sandy. Jack ducks, avoiding injury as Sandy's pushed back against a ledge. 
Sandy quickly grabs Pitch with another DREAMSAND STREAM and yanks him off his feet, slamming him repeatedly against the tops of the buildings until finally throwing him off the rooftop. 
Pitch bounces off the ground as he crashes into an EMPTY STREET. As Sandy dusts his hands and calmly steps off the rooftop to follow, Jack looks on, astonished. 
JACK Remind me not to get on your bad side. 
EXT. EMPTY STREET - CONTINUOUS 
Pitch shakes off the crash, trying to back up as Sandy touches down and moves toward him, Jack following. Pitch cowers on the ground in fear as they approach. 
PITCH (looks up, pleading) Okay, easy! You can't blame me for trying, Sandy. You don't know what it's like to be weak and hated. It was stupid of me to mess with your dreams. So I'll tell you what- 
Sandy continues forward, grim faced...but suddenly Pitch stops cowering and stands up. His tone changes. 
PITCH (CONT'D) You can have `em back! 
Before Jack and Sandy can react, a Nightmare shoots up through a storm drain as several other Nightmares gather in the alley behind him. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 71. 
Jack and Sandy look around as hundreds of Nightmares descend from the surrounding rooftops to encircle them. This doesn't look good. Jack, worried, looks to Sandy and mutters... 
JACK You take the ones on the left, I'll take the ones on the right? 
Meanwhile, Pitch rises up from off the ground as Onyx takes shape underneath him. 
Pitch grabs onto Onyx's mane as it snorts and snarls. He then leans forward. 
PITCH Boo! 
Pitch's army of Nightmares begin to charge. Then suddenly, the sound of BELLS and REINDEER echo in the distance-- 
NORTH'S SLEIGH bursts through the clouds. Jack and Pitch look up into the sky as it circles overhead. The sleigh turns toward Pitch, only to fly a few feet over his head. Pitch turns as it passes over him, slightly confused. 
NORTH'S SLEIGH 
North's asleep at the wheel, along with Bunny and Tooth. Suddenly, the sleigh clips one of its skis as it flies over City Hall, jolting North to attention. 
NORTH Ah! 
Bunny awakes with a fright from a bad a dream. 
BUNNYMUND Get outta my warren! (realizes he's awake now) Huh? 
EXT. EMPTY STREET - CONTINUOUS 
Still battling Nightmares, Sandy propels himself and Jack into the air with a stream of Dreamsand and launches Jack away from the Nightmares. Jack quickly orients himself and knocks an oncoming Nightmare with his staff. 
Tooth quickly jumps off the side of the sleigh toward Jack and Sandy. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 72. 
Jack, knocks away a few more Nightmares with his staff, and looks up. Tooth suddenly flies into view through the swarm of Nightmares, slicing them apart with her wings, causing them to EXPLODE into BLACK SAND. 
PITCH 
Pitch gives a signal and leaps into the air, leading another wave of Nightmares after the Guardians. 
SLEIGH 
Back in the sleigh, Bunny jumps out and lands on a nearby roof. 
Bunny quickly tosses his boomerang which disintegrates every Nightmare in its path. Bunny catches the returning boomerang, leaps off the roof, and grabs the skids of the sleigh as it passes by. 
THE SLEIGH 
North stands, drawing both his scimitars, and dices the oncoming Nightmares to bits as they attack. 
NORTH Ha. Ha. Ha. Come on! 
Pitch looks on with a smile until a bolt of lightning suddenly erupts from within the writhing black sand. 
JACK 
JACK Ahhhhhh!!!!! 
A gust of wind blows past Pitch, quickly followed by a massive wave of ice and frost that rockets back up the stream of Nightmare sand toward him, culminating in an explosion of ice and snow. 
PITCH AAAHH!!!! 
EXT. BURGESS - NIGHT 
Jack free falls back to Earth, unconscious. 
NORTH Jack! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 76. 
Tooth quickly rescues him and sets him back down in the sleigh. 
TOOTH Jack, how did you do that? 
JACK (REGAINING CONSCIOUSNESS) I, I didn't know I could. 
EXT. BURGESS FOREST - NIGHT 
Pitch pulls himself laboriously from the mud and weeds amongst the trees where he's crash-landed, oddly, he seems delighted. 
He looks up to see a BRIGHT GLOW -- North's SNOWGLOBE PORTAL. The sleigh zooms into it and it WINKS OUT. 
Pitch shakes the FROST from his arms as scores of Nightmares swarm behind Pitch, regrouping after the blast. Pitch, at the center, seems as pleased as can be. 
PITCH Finally! Someone who knows how to have a little FUN!

SEQ. 1700 - GUARDIANS REGROUP 
INT. NORTH POLE - GLOBE ROOM - DAY 
We're in the midst of a somber ceremony, marking the passing of Sandy. Burning candles line the perimeter of Sandy's stone emblem. 
Tooth sets down a candle and stands shoulder to shoulder with North and Bunny. The three hold hands in solace. 
The ringing of somber bells can be heard echoing throughout the chamber, as we reveal the elves and a yeti ringing the elf bells as part of a ceremonial dirge. 
INT. NORTH POLE - GLOBE ROOM - DAY - MOMENTS LATER 
Jack, facing a window, FROSTS OVER THE GLASS with his finger to form a symbol of Sandy. North slowly walks up behind him. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 77. 
NORTH Are you alright? 
Jack remains still, his eyes fixed on the image of Sandy. 
JACK I just, I wish I could've done something. 
NORTH Done something? Jack, you stood up to Pitch. You saved us. 
JACK But Sandy wo-- 
NORTH (putting his hand on JACK'S SHOULDER) Would be proud of what you did. 
Jack pulls back his hoodie and stands up. 
NORTH (CONT'D) I don't know who you were in your past life, but in this life you are Guardian. 
JACK But how can I know who I am, until I find out who I was? 
NORTH You will. I feel it, in my belly. 
Jack and North approach the globe which is losing lights at an alarming rate. 
TOOTH Look how fast they're going out. 
JACK (GETTING IT) It's fear. He's tipped the balance. 
Jack drifts up closer the globe. He looks at the lights going out, then back to the Guardians. There's a nervous tension in the room. 
BUNNYMUND (twirling his boomerang) Hey, buck up ya sad-sacks. Come on! We can still turn this around! (MORE) Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 78. BUNNYMUND (CONT'D) Easter is tomorrow and I need your help. I say we pull out all the stops and we get those little lights flickering again! 
CUT TO: 
INT. NORTH POLE - FACTORY FLOOR - DAY 
A massive wooden door swings open; North leads Jack and the Guardians through the doorway, into an elevator, and through his factory. 
NORTH Bunny is right. (TO BUNNY) As much as it pains me to say old friend, this time Easter is more important than Christmas! 
BUNNYMUND Hey! Did everyone hear that?! 
NORTH We must hurry to the Warren. Everyone, to the sleigh! 
BUNNY Ohh no, mate. My warren my rules. Buckle up. 
Bunny directs the groups attention to the ground. He taps his foot and a rabbit hole opens up under their feet. 
NORTH Shostakovich!

SEQ. 1775 - PREPARATION FOR EASTER 
Jack continues along a shadowed corridor. 
JACK Afraid? 
Jack sees Pitch on a bridge across the cavern and heads after him. 
JACK (CONT'D) I'm not afraid of you! 
PITCH Maybe not. But you are afraid of something. 
Jack steadily approaches, cautious and alert. 
JACK You think so, huh? Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 89. 
PITCH I know so. It's the one thing I always know. 
Pitch finally turns to face Jack. 
PITCH (CONT'D) People's greatest fears. Yours is that no one will ever believe in you. 
Panic flashes in Jack's eyes. As he backs away, the chamber fills with shadows, and Jack is spun around. He's disoriented as he thuds into a wall, which flips to reveal that it's actually the ground. 
Pitch, unseen now, chuckles. 
Jack's unsure of where he is. He looks back to see the cavern entrance -- he's right back where he started. 
PITCH (O.S.) And worst of all, you're afraid you'll never know why. Why you? Why were you chosen...to be like this? 
Jack discovers that the entrance has been blocked with bricks as Pitch's shadow encroaches on him. 
PITCH Well fear not, for the answer to that... 
Pitch is now directly in front of Jack, holding out a tooth box. 
PITCH (CONT'D) Is right here. 
Jack's eyes widen at the sight - the face of a young boy etched into the box, and under it is the name "Jack Frost." 
PITCH Do you want them, Jack? Your memories? 
He holds them out to Jack. Jack stares, fighting the impulse to grab them. He closes his eyes, struggling to make a decision, but when he opens them again, Pitch has disappeared. 
Pitch's shadow moves across the pillars of the cavern. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 90. 
Jack heads down a corridor, cast shadows from the Mini Tooth cages everywhere. 
PITCH (O.S.) Everything you wanted to know... 
Pitch's face moves in and out of the shadows over the following. 
PITCH ...in this little box. 
Every time Jack turns, Pitch disappears. It's like Jack's trapped in a fun house. 
Multiple Pitch shadows have appeared on the wall around Jack. They're closing in on him. 
PITCH Why did you end up like this? Unseen. Unable to reach out to anyone. (BEAT) You want the answers so badly. You want to grab them, and fly off with them. But you're afraid of what the Guardians will think. 
Jack's breath quickens. He's been pushed into a corner. 
PITCH You're afraid of disappointing them. (SMILES) Well let me ease your mind about one thing. They'll never accept you. Not really. 
The shadows have overcome Jack. 
JACK (trying to scramble away) Stop it! Stop it! 
Almost reluctantly, the shadows back away and Pitch appears before Jack. 
PITCH After all, you're not one of them. 
Jack aims his staff at Pitch. 
JACK You don't know what I am! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 91. 
PITCH Of course I do. You're Jack Frost. You make a mess wherever you go. Why, you're doing it right now. 
Pitch tosses the box to Jack, who instinctively catches it. Jack looks up. Terror comes into Jack's eyes, as he realizes... 
JACK What did you do? 
PITCH More to the point Jack, what did you do? 
Pitch begins to back away, becoming one with the darkness, laughing as he disappears. Jack charges towards him only to be swallowed whole by one of Pitch's black holes.

SEQ. 2200 - GUARDIANS BREAK WITH JACK 
INT. EGG TUNNEL - DAY 
Jack flies out of Pitch's shadow, ready to strike. Suddenly, Jack realizes he's forgotten something. 
JACK Baby Tooth! 
He turns to re-enter the hole in the wall only to find himself face to face with one of Bunny's stone emblems. 
PITCH (O.S.) Happy Easter, Jack. 
Jack turns around. Suddenly, his eyes fill with dread as he realizes where he is. Thousands of broken egg shells lay strewn about, forming a path toward the light at the end of the tunnel. 
As Jamie gets up off the ground, he sees that the Easter egg was in fact a dirty old tennis ball. Jamie stands up, bewildered, and dusts himself off as his friends LAUGH. A few have empty EASTER BASKETS. 
JAMIE Let's check the park again. 
CALEB Really? 
CLAUDE (ANNOYED) For what, the Easter Bunny? 
JAMIE Guys, I told you - I saw him! He's way bigger than I thought, and he's got these cool boomerang-things- 
CALEB Grow up, Jamie. 
CLAUDE (SIGHS) Ah man, seriously. 
JAMIE What's happened to you guys? 
CALEB It was a dream. You should be happy you still get dreams like that and not... 
They begin to turn away from him. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 96. 
CUPCAKE (HAUNTED) Nightmares. 
Pippa's the lone straggler. She looks tired, depressed, and hands Jamie her basket as she leaves. 
PIPPA Forget it, Jamie. There's just no Easter this year. 
CALEB (O.S.) I can't believe this. 
JAMIE He really is real! 
Pippa walks away, trailing the others. Jamie doesn't know what to believe. He hangs his head and looks into the Easter basket, it's empty. 
JAMIE (CONT'D) I know he is.

EXT. ICEBERG - ANTARCTIC CIRCLE - DAY 
Jack runs to the edge of a floating iceberg, ready to throw his tooth box into the ocean. He resists, looking down at the box as he clutches it in his hand. He's never been more alone in his life. 
PITCH (O.S.) I thought this might happen. 
Pitch is revealed, standing not far behind Jack. 
PITCH (CONT'D) They never really believed in you. I was just trying to show you that. But I understand. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 97. 
Jack whips around and shoots a burst of frost at Pitch, but it's quickly deflected by the Nightmare sand. 
JACK You don't understand anything! 
Jack continues to attack, lashing out with his staff. Pitch blocks the attacks of ice and frost -- his control over the Nightmare sand has gained considerable strength. 
PITCH (SHOUTING) No? I don't know what it's like to be cast out? 
Pitch strikes back, putting Jack on the defense. Jack jumps in the air. Their show of force escalates until they're shrouded in a blanket of snow, ice, and wind. As the wind and snow settle, Jack looks around stern and alert. 
PITCH (O.S.)(CONT'D) To not be believed in. To long for a family. 
Jack turns around to find Pitch. There's a look of compassion on Jack's face as he listens. 
PITCH (CONT'D) All those years in the shadows I thought, no one else knows what this feels like. But now I see I was wrong. 
They lock eyes. A moment of true connection between them. 
PITCH (CONT'D) We don't have to be alone, Jack. 
This isn't a trick Pitch is making a real offer here. 
PITCH (CONT'D) I believe in you. And I know children will too. 
JACK In me? 
PITCH Yes! Look at what we can do! 
Pitch gestures to a fantastical ice and nightmare "sculpture" that was created (off-screen) when Jack attacked him. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 98. 
PITCH (CONT'D) What goes together better than cold and dark? 
Jack looks at the fractured reflections of themselves cast in the icy sculpture. 
PITCH (CONT'D) We can make them believe. We'll give them a world where everything, everything is... 
Jack turns to face Pitch. 
JACK (DEADPANS) Pitch black... 
Pitch, realizing how this looks, clarifies... 
PITCH And Jack Frost too. They'll believe in both of us. 
Jack stares at him, considering the offer. Then finally... 
JACK No, they'll fear both of us. And that's not what I want. 
AND THEN-- 
START JACK'S MEMORY 
We are on an eye, a familiar eye but this one is brown not blue. PULL BACK to reveal young JACK, brown hair, brown eyes. He is staring directly at the camera, a look of...what is it? It's hard to read but it's VERY intense. We keep pulling back to reveal him dressed as we first saw him in 16th century clothes. Behind him, dark winter trees and snow come in to focus. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 102. 
EXT. FROZEN POND - BURGESS - DAY 
JACK (calm, serious) It's okay. It's okay. Don't look down, just look at me. 
Jack reaches slowly down and removes the second of two rudimentary ice-skates, leaving him BAREFOOT on the surface of a familiar FROZEN pond. And now we see what he sees, a girl of about FOUR (with an uncanny resemblance to Jamie's sister Sophie) stands in her skates, rooted to the spot. A spider's web of cracks emanates from where she stands. 
JACK'S SISTER Jack, I'm scared. 
CRACCKKK! The ice below her splinters more. She wobbles as it starts to separate. 
JACK I know, I know...but you're gonna be alright. You're not gonna fall in. We're gonna have a little fun instead. 
JACK'S SISTER No we're not! 
JACK Would I trick you? 
JACK'S SISTER (fighting back tears) Yes! You always play tricks! 
JACK (CHUCKLES) Well, alright. Well, not, not this time. I promise. I promise, you're gonna be...you're gonna be fine. 
Jack fixes her gaze...holds it...there's nothing but the two of them. 
JACK You have to believe in me. 
Jack's sister pauses a moment, then smiles through her fear. 
And just like that, Jack's demeanor changes. A light is switched on inside him and the last thing that could be happening is what is actually happening. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 103. 
JACK (CONT'D) (casual, playfully) You wanna play a game? We're going to play Hopscotch! Like we play every day! 
Jack's sister looks more reassured. 
JACK (CONT'D) It's as easy as...one...whoaaaa... 
And Jack shows his sister the first leap, but mugs for her, almost losing his balance then catching himself. She laughs. 
JACK (CONT'D) Two... (the next jump) Three! 
He turns toward her with his arms spread out. 
JACK Alright... 
He reaches down to pick up a familiar-looking stick lying on the ice. He extends it towards her -- 
JACK (CONT'D) Now it's your turn. 
Jack's sister looks down. She is trying to gather her courage. Jack, never breaking his gaze with her, 
JACK (CONT'D) (SOFTLY) One... 
She hops, wobbling, but catching her balance. 
JACK That's it, that's it...two... 
She's almost there, Jack's staff just beyond her reach. 
JACK Three. 
She grabs hold of Jack's staff and in one massive effort he slings her with all his might to safety. But the movement propels him into the cracked ice. He looks up to see his sister safe - smiles - and then plunges into the dark cold water. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 104. 
JACK Whoa... 
JACK'S SISTER Jack! 
Jack falls back into the icy water. SPLASH! 
UNDERWATER 
We're looking up at the hole in the ice, descending into the dark icy depths...then THE FULL MOON appears from behind the clouds as Jack's hands claw through the water towards it, but it's helpless. The MOON glows bright...brighter... 
Jack's BODY begins to glow, bathed in MOONLIGHT. PUSH IN on his FACE, becoming brighter and brighter until his brown hair turns white and JACK'S BRIGHT BLUE EYES flash open -- 
EXT. MOUNTAIN FISSURE - NIGHT 
The icy walls rush back in as we pull out from Jack, reeling from the memory. He sees Baby Tooth. 
JACK Did you -- did you see that? 
She shakes her head `no', tweets `of course not'! 
JACK It -- it was me! I had a family! I had a sister! 
His excitement suddenly turns to realization. 
JACK I saved her! 
He looks up at the opening above. The MOON peeks out from behind the clouds. 
JACK (whispers up to Manny) That's why you chose me. (TO HIMSELF) I'm, I'm a Guardian. 
The Moon seems to shine a little BRIGHTER. Baby Tooth tries to take flight but she sputters and lands back in the palm of Jack's hand. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 105. 
JACK We have to get out of here. 
Jamie lets the stuffed animal fall to the floor. Jack comes into the room and watches as the light slowly fades from Jamie's eyes, disbelief setting in. 
Jack doesn't know what to do. He takes a moment to concentrate, then enters the room. 
Then, Jamie notices the window as the panes of glass freeze over. The image of an Easter egg suddenly appears... 
JAMIE (seeing the window) Huh? 
Jamie looks down at the stuffed rabbit on the floor. He can barely comprehend what he's seeing. Jamie looks back to the window as more of the window panes frost over. Jamie's eyes get huge with amazement. 
JAMIE He's real. 
Jack, excited, continues to exert himself trying to bring life to his drawing. And when he does, the frost rabbit comes leaping off of the window. 
JAMIE Whoa... 
The rabbit hops around Jamie's room, bursting like a snowball over Jamie's head, the snowflakes sprinkling down on him. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 109. 
JAMIE Whoa! 
Jack is as amazed as Jamie. But Jamie's amazement turns to confusion. 
JAMIE Snow? 
A snowflake lands on the tip of Jamie's nose. The snowflake glows a magic blue. And in that moment a light comes into Jamie's eyes - an idea starts to take hold. 
JAMIE (WHISPER) Jack Frost? 
JACK (a stunned beat) Did he just say--? 
Jamie stands up on his bed. 
JAMIE Jack Frost. 
JACK (DISBELIEF) He said it again. He said -- (BEAT) You said... 
Jamie turns around and suddenly his eyes go wide... 
JAMIE Jack Frost. 
JACK That's right! But-but that's me! Jack Frost! That's my name! You said my name! 
Jamie's mouth drops open. Only then does Jack realize... 
JACK Wait, can you hear me? (JAMIE NODS) Can you... Can you see me? (JAMIE NODS) He sees me. He sees me! 
Jack leaps for joy, and the room suddenly explodes with snow. Jamie can't believe it. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 110. 
JAMIE You just made it snow.

NORTH AND TOOTH arrive on the sleigh completely out of control, and crash land outside Jamie's house. 
The reindeer are separated from the sleigh and run into the woods. A disheveled Tooth and North emerge from the wreckage. 
NORTH Ah, moi deti! Come back! 
As North stands, his back suddenly gives out. 
North and Tooth trade looks of concern. Then, a menacing chuckle. The Guardians keep a watchful eye as Nightmare shadow streaks across the alley. 
PITCH (V.O.) All this fuss over one little boy. And still he refuses to stop believing. 
A CRACK of Thunder reveals the shadow of an approaching Nightmare as the sounds of hooves clacking against the ground echoes from the opposite end of the alley. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 115. 
PITCH Very well. There are other ways to snuff out a light. 
Bulbs start bursting as the arm of a shadow moves across the remaining lights in the alley. Terror in Jamie's eyes. What does that mean? 
BUNNYMUND If you want him, you're gonna have to go through me! 
With a finger raised, the shadow arm glides along the floor, curling around the back of Bunny. 
PITCH (laughing, genuinely) Look how fluffy you are! Would you like a scratch behind the ears? 
Bunny jumps back into North's arms. 
BUNNYMUND Don't you even think about it! 
Pitch comes into view, riding atop Onyx. A gleeful smile strewn across his face. 
PITCH I can't tell you how happy it makes me to see you all like this. You look awful. 
They are weak and defenseless. But still the Guardians gather around Jamie, to shield him from whatever may come.

Jamie gives Jack a questioning look. What does Jack have in mind? Pitch gets closer. 
PITCH So what do you think, Jamie? Do you believe in the Boogiema... 
BOOF! A snowball suddenly hits Pitch in the face. Two Nightmares look at each, unsure how to react. Jamie can't help but snicker and North lets out a chuckle. 
Jack looks around the alley. He spots a wooden crate, a trash can lid and a discarded wok amidst a pile of trash. 
JACK Now let's go get your friends. 
Pitch wipes the snow from his face and looks up to see a track of ice leading out of the alleyway. Jack, Jamie and the Guardians are gone.

PIPPA Jamie, how are you doing that?!

NORTH Your center? 
JACK It took awhile, but I figured it out.

He throws a snowball, which hits Bunny smack in the face. 
Pitch groans in pain, and rises up to see the town crawling with Dreamsand creatures, snowballs flying and yetis playing. 
PITCH (TO HIMSELF) No. 
He whips around to see the kids - having the time of their lives - and no fear in their eyes. He rises up, his entire body shaking with rage, and screams at them. 
PITCH (CONT'D) You dare have fun in my presence! I am the Boogeyman! AND YOU WILL FEAR ME! 
He lunges at Jamie who come running toward him, Pitch's hands outstretched as if he's going to grab him by the throat. But Jamie runs right through him, laughing, joyous.

Pitch slips on the ice, and falls backwards. He looks up to see North smiling down at him. 
NORTH Leaving the party so soon? 
TOOTH You didn't even say goodbye. 
Tooth tosses something to Pitch which he catches. He looks down. It's a quarter. 
PITCH A quarter? 
BLAM. A fist punches him right in the jaw, and a single tooth goes skittering across the ice. Tooth shakes out her hand. 
TOOTH And that's for my fairies. 
PITCH (SCOWLS) You can't get rid of me! Not forever! There will always be fear! 
NORTH So what? As long as one child believes, we will be here to fight fear! 
PITCH Really? Then what are they doing here? 
Hundreds of Nightmares emerge from the woods, surrounding the pond. It's terrifying, but the Guardians seem unphased.

He tries to run, but it's impossible to get his footing on the ice. He falters, and is swept up in the stampede of Nightmares. The streaks of black whip and latch themselves onto Pitch as the black cloud carries him through the forest. 
PITCH (CONT'D) No, no, nooooooo! 
Pitch struggles to escape, but the mass of black sand pulls him deep into the forest, under the frame of the broken bed, and back down into the dark depths of the underground. He looks up at the moon as he disappears and the hole in the earth seals itself up.

EXT. POND - THE MOON 
Pale and faint in the day, but oddly close and welcoming. It can't be, but -- is that the barest hint of a FACE on the Moon? Jack smiles as he looks up at it. He hears Tooth's laugh and turns to find North, Tooth, Bunny and Sandy, their faces shining with pride. 
Tooth comes flying in to give Jack a hug. She lifts him off the ground as they embrace. They share a moment and she soon recoils with giddy embarrassment as Baby Tooth interjects.

NORTH Are you ready now, Jack? (BEAT) To make it official.

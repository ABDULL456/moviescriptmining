EXT. LAUGHTER, COLORADO - DAY 
Half a dozen abandoned shacks and a boarded up gas station make up the central hub of Laughter, Colorado. She'd be a ghost town âcept the ghosts considered her a shithole ages ago and baled. The buck ten for leaded sign gives us an idea how long ago this place went dry. Suddenly an old Chevy RIPS around the corner, wheels sending PLUMES of dust skyward. 
INT. OLD CHEVY - DAY 
Three grimy looking fuckers are stuffed into the cab. FUCKING DRIVER looks as though he may piss himself. FUCKING MIDDLE twists around, glares through the back glass and FUCKING PASSENGER white-knuckles a tire iron. 
FUCKING DRIVER Goddamned old man! 
FUCKING PASSENGER I thought he was dead! She said he was dead! 
FUCKING MIDDLE I don't see him. Just go. I think we lost him. 
EXT. LAUGHTER - MAIN STREET - DAY 
They race through the dusty derelict little town, peeling for the main road in the distance when they round a corner -- --to face a â70 PLYMOUTH ROADRUNNER, beat to shit, engine screaming. SPEEDING head on. This ain't chicken because these three Fuckers don't even have time to react before: 
MILTON âThe Old Manâ, shock of white hair, drives the Roadrunner, locks the tires and spins the wheel. The Roadrunner fishtails, slides sideways AT THEM! The truck's gonna ram the driver's side. At least it would 
BUT: MILTON AIMS A SHOTGUN through the driver's side window. Fearless. Pissed off. He FIRES! 
The shot BLOOMS right at us! Then SLOWS TO NEAR FROZEN - Hanging in mid-air - suspended, like we could touch it: TITLE CARD appears-- 
"DRIVE ANGRY" --then the shot BURSTS through the title! SHATTERING the words right at us! 
ANOTHER ANGLE ...EXPLODING into the hood of the Chevy! The hood RIPS up, SLAMS the windshield. Truck CAREENS out of control! Milton GUNS the Roadrunner away from truck...but... KRAACK - The Truck nails the Roadrunner's rear quarter panel. Roadrunner and truck go into a spin. A tornado of dust SWIRLS around the two vehicles. The Roadrunner SPLINTERS into a boarded store front! The Truck HITS a ditch and UPENDS. Flips. SLAMS into the dirt on its roof, wheels SPINNING. 
ANOTHER ANGLE Smoke HISSES from the totalled Roadrunner. Door creeks open. Milton emerges slow and sure. He crosses toward the Chevy. Fucking Passenger rises from behind the truck and rushes Milton, tire iron held high over his head! Milton spins and KUH-FOOM! --blows Fucking Passenger's hand clean off! Passenger screams as Milton snatches the iron out of the air and -- 
KER-ACK! -- slams it across his face! Passenger drops. Hard. Milton stoops, removes Passenger's wallet, digs the cash out. 
OVER MILTON'S SHOULDER Fucking Driver scrambles from behind the wheel, springs to his feet and runs. 
Milton spins, BLOWS his knee apart from 20 paces. Driver SCREAMS and face-firsts the cracked pavement. 
ANOTHER ANGLE As Fucking Middle drags himself from the passenger side. He got the worst of it. Looks like his face went through the windshield. He looks up -- -- into the barrel of Milton's shotgun. A beat. 
FUCKING MIDDLE I'll never tell you where they've taken her...NEVER. 
MILTON I know. The EXPLOSION vaporizes what's left of his face. 
ON FUCKING DRIVER As he tries to stand but his lower leg dangles from a piece of cartilage. He falls, WRITHES on the ground. He looks up at Milton standing over him. 
FUCKING DRIVER You...you took my leg you fuck! Milton presses the shotgun barrel into the man's good knee. 
PIPER Did...did you just throw scrambled eggs at us? 
FAT LOU I don't pay you bitches to stand around. Now get the fuck back to work! Piper snatches one of the plates. She delivers it to a Patron sitting at the bar, then turns toward the newly arrived customers. The American Indian couple scans a menu... ...and Milton (the old guy from our opening) scans her...he quickly looks down at an unfolded map of Colorado as -- NormaJean steps up to Milton. 
NORMAJEAN Hello beautiful, coffee? 
MILTON That'd be great. Tell me, Stillwater Marsh around here? 
NORMAJEAN (shrugs) Stillwater...doesn't ring a bell. I'll get that coffee. But Milton makes eye contact with Mary, the Indian mother. She quickly looks away. She knows something... Milton opens his mouth to speak as-- --Piper approaches the American Indian couple. 
PIPER Hi guys, I'm Piper. Can I bring you something to drink? 
MOTHER MARY We'll take this. 
Mary points to the menu, Piper leans in, reads. 
PIPER âShe's a Brickhouseâ breakfast. Ten monster flapjacks for 4.99. 
MOTHER MARY And five waters. 
PIPER Five waters. And what can I get for... Father averts his eyes. He's embarrassed. 
MOTHER MARY That's it. Just the pancakes. If that's okay? Piper stares at them as if for the first time. Shit... they're hungry. And broke. 
PIPER Oh. Of course. Coming right up. Piper shoots Milton a look as she crosses to the kitchen. Milton rises slightly. He's clearly trying to get Mary's attention. She's ignoring him. Piper calls through the window to Fat Lou. 
PIPER One brickhouse. She turns and stops suddenly. Stares at a pile of muffins kept fresh within a glass cake stand. 
ANOTHER ANGLE Mary can no longer avoid Milton's stare. 
MILTON Stillwater Marsh? You know it? Dale, the father, keeps his back to Milton as he speaks. 
DALE No. We don't. 
MILTON It's important. 
MOTHER MARY You're in the wrong state. 
DALE Mary! 
MILTON And what state Should I be in? Dale turns, glares at Milton. 
DALE Nevada. Catch the 50 and cut across. It's a two day drive from here. 
MILTON And Wolf Deer Run? 
DALE Never heard of it. The 7 year old LITTLE GIRL'S eyes brighten. 
LITTLE GIRL Yes you have daddy. Wolf Deer Run, that's where The Smiling Man takes the wicked children to see the Mother of all things. Mary SHUSHES her Little Girl and pulls her close. 
MILTON Mother of all things, that sounds very interesting. 
LITTLE GIRL Oh it is! The Mother of all things bleeds black tears unto those who 
FAT LOU Let...go...of...my... She SLAPS him across the face with her free hand. 
PIPER Shut up. She takes a step backwards, but keeps her hand clamped to his nuts. He has no choice but follow. She pulls him up to the American Indian family. 
PIPER Tell'em. 
FAT LOU Wha...what? We see it in her face. She squeezes. Lou's eyes go wide...flutter...he's about to pass out. 
PIPER Tell them...the muffins...are on the house. 
FAT LOU On. The. House. She lets go. Lou drops to his knees, then timbers to the floor as Piper turns to the family. The children are huddled, terrified against their parents. 
PIPER I'm sorry your kids had to see that. Put some honey butter on those bran muffins and they taste an awful lot better. Piper turns and crosses toward the door. NormaJean is pale as she watches her go. Piper brushes past Milton's booth. His cup is there but Milton is gone. 
EXT. FAT LOU'S ROADSIDE DINER - DAY 
We're close on a car door as it SLAMS. CLOSE ON GLASS PACK EXHAUST PIPES as the car RUMBLES with life. An âI brake for pussyâ bumper sticker stands out. THE BACK GLASS vibrates as MUSIC blares from within. 
INT. GTO - DAY 
Piper's French manicured hand wraps the floor-mounted gear shift like a cock and SLAMS it into drive. 
EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - DAY 
With Piper behind the wheel the GTO tears onto the highway... ...and blows passed Milton, as he walks west, duffle bag thrown over his shoulder. 
INT. GTO - DAY 
Piper SINGS. She's empowered. Then... 
KA-THUNK. She grips the wheel. The RPMS drop. 
EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - DAY 
The GTO pulls off the road...white smoke HISSES from beneath the hood. CLOSE ON ENGINE as the hood POPS. Piper waves a hand in front of her face as the smoke devours her. She COUGHS. Stares. It's clear she don't know jack shit about engines. FOOTSTEPS. Piper slips the keys between her fingers. Ready. Milton appears through the smoke. 
MILTON Car trouble? Piper stares. It's the way he said it. Too knowing. Milton glances at the engine. 
MILTON Oh, that's not so bad. I can fix that for you if you like. 
PIPER I would. Thank you. 
MILTON If you give me a lift. 
PIPER I'm only going as far as Blackfoot Falls. The truckstop there. 
MILTON And I'd be much obliged. Milton leans in, flicks something then rises and THUMPS the hood shut with a smile. 
MILTON Shall we? 
INT. GTO - DAY 
Piper behind the wheel focuses on the road. Milton sits in the passenger seat, hugs his duffle bag, glances at Piper. Suddenly Piper turns on him. 
INT. LAURA'S MOTEL - ROOM 9 - DAY 
Piper stuffs a gym bag with clothes. 
FRANK Now baby, just hold on. 
PIPER I'm warning you, Frank. Don't come near me. 
FRANK Look, sooner you accept this is your fault, the better. Piper stops, turns, stares. 
FRANK Baby, I can't just turn it off. Now you know that. I gotta have it. At least once a day. It's in the wiring. You did this. You made me cheat on you. You're lucky I'm not more pissed about it. Piper stares for a moment. It's like she's been sucker punched. Then she zips her bag and crosses to the door. 
FRANK Piper! Now cut it out. Enough with the drama! 
INT. HIGHWAY 70 - LAURA'S MOTEL - PHONE BOOTH - DAY 
Milton watches Piper's room. It's clear the phone to his ear is a fake out. Suddenly a look crosses his face. He jerks around. 
HIS POV 
THE GAS STATION ACROSS HIGHWAY 70 ...the garage. A grimy looking GREASE MONKEY is staring at Milton, cell phone to his ear. He sees Milton see him, quickly backs into the shadows. 
FRANK (O.S.) Piper! 
EXT. LAURA'S TRUCK STOP MOTEL - DAY 
Piper exits, glances at Mona, sprawled out unconscious in the metal chair, an ASIAN MAN in a Hawaiian shirt SNAPS pictures of her. Piper snatches the camera and flings it against the wall where it SHATTERS. 
ASIAN MAN Hey?! 
PIPER Pervert. Piper stomps across the lot as Frank exits, calls to her. 
FRANK Baby, Please. Now hold on. Can we talk about this? Piper keeps walking. Never looks back. 
FRANK Piper, stop this! You got nowhere to go and you know it. 
PIPER I'll go to San Francisco and stay with my cousin. 
FRANK (Realization) Whoa. You ain't taking my car. Piper pulls out the keys, twirls them on her finger. 
FRANK I said, you ain't taking my car, bitch. Frank grabs her by the shoulder. Piper spins and -- 
WHAM! -- punches him in the face. Caught off guard, Frank stumbles, nearly goes down. 
PIPER Your car?! Who's been making the payments you out of work, skanky Mona fucking piece of shit?! She drops the gym bag and launches into him. A blur of FISTS and CLAWS. The tears flow. Heartbreak, anger, humiliation. Frank stumble backwards. Tries to block the blows. WHAM! 
FRANK Stop... 
WHAM! 
FRANK ...hitting me! 
She swings but this time Frank lashes out. 
CANDY You want a drink? You gotta be a member. Dry county. 
MILTON You're kidding. 
CANDY Welcome to Utah, Mr... 
She takes his license. 
MILTON Call me Milton. 
CANDY This license isn't just expired. It's an antique. 
MILTON Fine, then bring me a milk. She tosses his card on the table. 
CANDY For you, gorgeous, we'll break the rules. Shhhh, don't tell nobody. Milton watches her go. Drinking her up. 
PIPER You gonna tap that? 
MILTON Tap what? 
PIPER Jeez, Milton, how long's it been? Sounds like you used to stick it in anything with a crack. 
MILTON Yeah. Well. I've been distracted. 
PIPER Suit yourself. But nobody reaches the end and says, âWish I hadn't fucked so much.â Milton's gaze returns to Candy. Even a man as driven as he needs a reboot sometimes. Candy catches his look, smiles. Piper slides from the booth. 
MILTON Where are you...? 
PIPER I'm gonna do my nails, take a hot bath and sleep in a warm bed. 
MILTON What about your beer? 
PIPER You drink it. See you at dawn. But she walks right passed the âMotel Guestsâ door and approaches the Busboy, who's already eyeing her. As she does, our focus settles on a shadowy area at the back of the bar. JONAH KING steps into the light. Ruggedly good looking. He wears a necklace with something bulky hidden beneath his shirt. There's an old scar under his left eye but a scar on this guy simply adds to his fuckabilty factor. He glances at Milton then -- 
JONAH KING It's Roy isn't it? Roy spins from the bar, smiles a friendly smile. 
ROY Sure is. Get you a drink friend? 
JONAH KING Fantastic place you have here. You don't happen to rent it out for parties do you? 
ROY We sure do. You planing a party? Again Jonah glances at Milton. 
JONAH KING Oh yes. Tonight, in fact. 
INT. LAURA'S MOTEL - ROOM 9 - NIGHT 
The Television chatters away with local nightly news. Frank ignores it, paces on the phone. As he does, we see Jonah King's face on the TV. The same guy from the bar. Archive footage of him preaching, warm, friendly. 
FRANK TV NEWS Mom...Mom...Mom! Would you Reverend Jonah King, the self- shut up and listen?! I've proclaimed prophet whose lost her for good this time. church has come under fire She's gone. I just want my for his anti-establishment car back.

End of have recently learned that story. She ain't coming King had a prior relationship back. Mom...mom...Mom! with one of the deceased. 
KNOCK KNOCK 
FRANK I gotta go. Frank clicks his phone shut, jerks the door open to find -- The Accountant smiling at him. 
TROOPER #1 Frank Raimi? 
TROOPER #2 You called about a stolen car? The Accountant gestures over his shoulder. 
ACCOUNTANT In there. Trooper #1 moves toward the opened door. The Accountant steps in front of Trooper #2. 
ACCOUNTANT I'm looking for someone. Five- eleven. White hair. Driving a â67 GTO. He's traveling with her. He hands Trooper #2 the framed photo. 
TROOPER #2 Excuse me? The Accountant pulls a shiny, ancient coin, worn from being worried over the years, from his pocket. He tosses it, the coin catching the light, glinting madly. Trooper #2 stares at it. Can't seem to take his eyes off it. Trooper #1's eyes widen as he stares into Frank's room. 
TROOPER #1 Jesus. He pulls his gun. Points it at the Accountant. 
TROOPER #1 Keep your hands where I can see them! 
ACCOUNTANT Troopers, this is your lucky day. Trooper #2 is watching the hypnotic glinting coin. ANGLE - High looking down on the trio as the coin spins right in front of us - we glimpse the ancient face in the worn silver - Roman maybe? 
TROOPER #1 Show us your hands, asshole. (to his partner) What's the matter with you?! Draw your weapon! 
Trooper #2 slowly reaches for his gun until... The Accountant snatches the coin from the sky, thrusts it at the two cops. 
ACCOUNTANT Here. Look at this. They don't see a coin. But a badge. Letters F.B.I. on it. 
TROOPER #1 You're... you're a Fed? 
ACCOUNTANT In pursuit of a white haired man. John Milton. He's travelling with the girl in this picture. Trooper #1 fixes his eyes on the photo of Piper & Frank in his partner's hand. Lowers his weapon. 
TROOPER #1 But, that guy, in the room. He's - 
ACCOUNTANT --Dead. Yes. I'd say it's unfortunate, but I'd be lying. World won't miss him. Look, troopers. I need your help with my pursuit of this fugitive. If we, we three, can apprehend him...you are ambitious, correct. 
TROOPER #2 I guess... 
TROOPER #1 Yes, we are... 
ACCOUNTANT Wasn't actually a question. I can tell you are. Success will mean promotion. Pay raise. I guarantee it. Now we are going to hunt this Milton, we are going to find the GTO he's driving and when we find him, you will shoot to kill. You understand? Shoot. To. Kill. The Accountant's voice is velvet. Hypnotic. Seductive. Purposeful. Promising glory with a hint of damnation. 
TROOPER #1 That's against protocol... 
ACCOUNTANT This man is highly dangerous. He has killed and will kill again. He must be taken down on sight. The time it takes you to follow your protocols is the time it takes him to end your life. The Accountant crosses to the cruiser's back door, the coin disappearing back into his pocket. 
ACCOUNTANT Shall we? 
INT. BULL BY THE BALLS MOTEL - NIGHT 
We're staring into two motel rooms. We're cheating...the wall that divides the rooms...divides the screen. The beds in each room butted up against the dividing wall. On one side we see Piper, on her back. Still clothed. At her feet, on his knees and completely naked, the Busboy. He's painting her toenails. On the other side we see Milton, on his back. Candy riding him like a fucking big-tittied stallion. Candy is a SCREAMER. The Busboy looks up, timidly. Then... 
BUSBOY Uh, are we gonna do it? 
PIPER Well, I don't know, baby. Depends on how well you do those nails. Now pay attention. You might need to redo that one. He hunches over and gets back to work. As Piper ties her hair up with a pink bandanna. Candy's SEX SCREAMS are starting to annoy the fuck out of her. She twists around with frustration and POUNDS the wall. 
PIPER Shut the fuck up in there! Milton twist and POUNDS the wall right back. 
MILTON You shut the fuck up! That's it! Piper swings her legs off of the bed. Busboy wasn't prepared and topples backwards to the floor. 
A NOISE Milton rolls Candy beneath him again and raises his head just in time to see-- 
MAN WITH SICKLE enter! He stares at his dead comrades in rage then glares at Milton. The glare becomes fear. Milton's already aiming the 357, then -- 
CLICK. CLICK-CLICK-CLICK Sickle smiles, raises the bladed weapon and-- 
KUR-RUNCH! The top of his head SPATTERS BLOOD as a hockey stick crashes down from above and behind. Sickle drops to the floor revealing Piper, white knuckling the hockey stick...her face pale. 
MILTON Thanks. Apparently I shot my wad. Milton stares down into Candy's face. Her whole body QUAKES...CONVULSES. She sucks in breath and opens her eyes. 
CANDY Jesus Christ. You're the best fuck I've ever had. Piper crosses to the adjoining room. 
CANDY Hello? Do you mind?! We're... Candy sits up and suddenly takes in her surroundings. She SCREAMS, wraps herself in a sheet and flees from the room. 
PIPER'S POV INTO HER ROOM Man with Axe is lying face down in his own blood. Dead. But it's Busboy who draws Piper's attention. Lying beneath blood drenched white sheets. He never saw it coming. 
PIPER Aw, hell. Milton, in pants, pulls his shirt on, rolls Man with Shotgun's face with his boot. Reloads the 357. 
MILTON I definitely got their attention. 
PIPER What. The fuck? You know these people? Milton flings his duffle over his shoulder. 
MILTON Come on. There are probably more. 
EXT. BULL BY THE BALLS BAR - FRONT - NIGHT 
Jonah King slips from the bar and rushes toward a parked Sedan. He POPS the trunk and grabs a gym bag. As he crosses toward the Driver's side door... The gym bag starts to CRY. 
JONAH KING Shhhh. Don't cry little precious. FF-FFUMP! Two doors shut. Jonah King turns, freezes. Our two State Troopers stand near their parked cruiser, staring from Jonah to the CRYING gym bag. For a cop, this is that one in a life time event. A career maker. News. Media. Leno. Then-- The cruiser's back door opens. The Accountant steps out. He ignores Jonah King and the crying gym bag. 
ACCOUNTANT Troopers. Remember why we're here. He walks by them towards the front door of the bar. Both Troopers turn and move around the side of building. Jonah King...stares...stunned, he absentmindedly scratches at the old scar on his face then leaps into the Sedan with the gym bag, engine ROARS to life. 
EXT. BULL BY THE BALLS BAR - BACK LOT - NIGHT 
Milton and Piper exit into the back lot. 
PIPER Milton, I'm serious! I want some answers! 
They turn as the SPEEDING Sedan tears onto the highway. As it disappears behind the barn it reveals -- --Man With Shovel. He FLINGS the barn doors open, stares at Milton and Piper for a moment then vanishes within. 
MILTON Yeah, we both want some answers. Milton moves toward the barn as-- The State Troopers walk around the bar. Everyone freezes. The Troopers stare from Piper to Milton, then back to Piper. Recognition. 
MILTON Aw fuck. Milton grabs Piper, places himself between she and the Troopers as they go for their guns. 
MILTON Come on! Milton pulls the 357 and opens fire! The Troopers, emboldened and fearless, stand their ground and shoot back! 
FFFUMP! Milton staggers, clutches his side. A crimson spot spreads across his belly. Piper tries to catch him as he stumbles, falls to one knee, his duffle tumbles to the ground, clothes spilling from within. 
PIPER No! The Troopers keep FIRING! Piper stares down at Milton's open duffle. There's a gun lying within the spilled clothes. An ancient six shooter. We get just a glimpse, but we can tell this isn't just any old gun. There's detailed inscriptions scrawled into the metal. The steel of it is thick, tarnished and somehow angry. She reaches for it. 
MILTON No! Not that one. He shoves the 357 toward her. Piper snatches it without hesitation, rises and -- 
KUPOW! Trooper #1's chest EXPLODES. The force spins him...still firing...he SHOOTS Trooper #2 in the ear! Both men crash to the ground. Dead. 
MILTON Sons of bitches killed my daughter. Piper stares. Milton steadies himself. 
MILTON So Yeah. I busted out. And I'm gonna get my grand-baby back. I'm gonna get her back and I'm gonna kill every last one of the fuckers. 
(A BEAT) You want out, I'll understand. Piper considers, then -- 
KUH-FWAM! They both slam into their seats as the GTO is rear-ended. 
EXT. GTO - NIGHT 
It's the Trooper's cruiser. The Accountant, face blank, sits behind the wheel. 
INT. GTO - NIGHT 
Milton fights with the wheel as the muscle car fishtails. He mashes the accelerator pulling out of the spin! 
MILTON In the back seat. Now. 
PIPER What? Why? 
MILTON Now! Piper scrambles into the back seat as Milton watches the cruiser pull up along side him. 
MILTON Shotgun. It's already loaded. Piper digs the shotgun from the duffle and heaves it into the front seat. 
MILTON Have the other one ready. Not the 357. The OLD one. 
THROUGH PASSENGER WINDOW The cruiser pulls up and matches the GTO's speed. After a beat the Accountant turns and smiles at Milton. Milton smiles back, lifts the shotgun, shoves the barrel through the passenger window. 
BOOOM! 
EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - DRY GORGE BRIDGE - NIGHT 
The cruiser's driver's side window explodes. 
INT. GTO - NIGHT 
MILTON'S POV 
The Accountant brushes shattered glass from his shoulder. When he looks back at Milton its with a face of arrogance. A cat toying with a three-legged mouse. He pulls the cruiser next to Milton. Matches the GTO's speed. Shouts across. 
ACCOUNTANT It's over, Milton. Stop the car. 
MILTON I can't do that. 
ACCOUNTANT Really? What makes you think you have a choice? 
MILTON I got something I gotta do first. 
ACCOUNTANT Then you should have done it a long time ago. 
MILTON I didn't have to do it a long time ago! 
ACCOUNTANT Milton, I will kill that nice woman in the backseat to get to you. 
MILTON Someone else. 
PIPER Is there anyone not trying to kill you? Milton stares up the road. Piper considers, then -- 
PIPER Come on. I'll help you. But we're dealing with that first? She points to his blood soaked shirt. 
EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - NIGHT 
The GTO THUNDERS beneath a starry sky. 
INT. GTO - NIGHT 
CLOSE ON SPEEDOMETER The needle hovers at 95 mph. 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL Piper behind the wheel. Milton, shirtless, his stomach wrapped in homemade bandages, grabs his shotgun, reloads. 
MILTON My daughter got mixed up with the son of a bitch right out of college. 
PIPER She knew him? She knew Jonah King, the man they think killed... She stops herself. 
MILTON She knew him. The world was in a fuckin tailspin and King was preaching quiet revolution. He places the shotgun on the dash, grabs the 357. 
MILTON It was four months before she realized âquiet' meant hiding in the basement, cutting the heads off chickens. 
PIPER Jonah King was into voodoo? Milton reloads the 357, slowly, methodically. 
MILTON Voodoo, the occult, not much he wasn't into. When she told him she was leaving, he helped her pack. Gassed up her car. Cooked her a hot meal. Then while she slept he broke her leg in three places with a tire iron. 
PIPER Jesus. She twists her pink bandanna nervously in her hands. 
MILTON She learned her lessen. Was a good little follower for eighteen months. That's when they met with some witch doctor bullshit artist in Chinatown. It was Chinese New Year so the place was wall to wall slants. She saw her chance, stabbed Jonah in the face with a souvenir corkscrew and vanished into the crowd. 
PIPER Milton. Your daughter was in a cult for two years and you didn't know? Why didn't you help her? Milton grabs the ancient six shooter. It's got real weight. His blood-stained fingers run down the scrolled steel. The gun almost seems alive. Pops the chamber. 
MILTON I didn't find out about any of this until...until I got locked up. Only two bullets left. He SNAPS the gun shut. Shoves it into his duffle. 
PIPER Not gonna reload? 
MILTON Only had three bullets to begin... 
PIPER Milton. 
THROUGH WINDSHIELD Lights ahead. Several. And road flares. There's been an accident. Milton eases the shotgun into his lap. 
EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - CRASH SITE - DAWN 
Several vehicles and an RV block the road. The PASSENGERS scramble back and forth. There's a jack-knifed flatbed, a crumpled Station Wagon and the Cultist's Dodge truck is overturned on the shoulder. 
INT. GTO - DAWN 
PIPER That's his truck. 
MILTON Stay put. I won't be long. 
JONAH KING Put the blonde in the RV. Tattooed Guy shoves Piper toward the RV as Skanky and Business woman climb in with the baby. Jonah aims the gun at Milton's face. 
MILTON I'm only gonna make this offer once. Give me my granddaughter and I'll let you liv-- 
KAPOW! He shoots Milton in the left eye! Milton's head snaps, he falls to the ground on his back. 
PIPER No!!! Tattooed Guy shoves Piper into the RV. 
INT. RV - DAWN 
Skanky tries to calm the crying baby. Tattoo shoves Piper onto the travel couch then hands the gun to Business Woman. 
BUSINESS WOMAN Please. Try something. 
Jonah climbs into the RV, closes the door. 
JONAH KING Let's go. 
PIPER You killed him! You bastard you -- 
WHACK! Piper's head rocks back as Business Woman pistol whips her. 
BUSINESS WOMAN Next time I shoot that mouth right off your face. Jonah gazes out the window as the RV pulls away, Piper's SOBS rising behind him. 
JONAH'S POV Milton's body lays there. Unmoving. His one eye staring skyward. Void of life as the RV pulls away, leaving the cluster of cars, the wreck and body of Milton behind. 
EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - CRASH SITE - DAWN 
Man With Wig pops the back of the Station wagon. Truck Driving Woman and Thin Old Man lean in, snatch two shovels. Burly Dude drags Leather Jacket's body next to Milton's as the others join him. They gaze down at Milton, his one eye open and unseeing. A single tear runs from it. The other, pools blood where the bullet entered. 
MILTON'S GOOD EYE TWITCHES. Everyone stares. Did they just see that right? 
THE 357 COMES UP IN MILTON'S HAND - FIRES! The bullet RIPS BURLY'S SCALP WIDE. He stumbles back. The others recoil. Burly ROARS, blood streaming from his head wound - charges Milton with the ax. MILTON unleashes rapid fire lead from the 357! 
Burly's blown back! The others scatter as Milton staggers to his feet! He grabs the shotgun, leans on it for support. 
ON GTO AS Milton stumbles to the open passenger door. 
ANOTHER ANGLE MAN WITH WIG comes from the back of the Station Wagon with the scoped hunting rifle. Aims. BLAM - His shot rips into the GTO, blows the side mirror off. Milton FIRES back with the shotgun - forcing Man with Wig back behind the wagon. 
INT. GTO - DAWN 
Milton falls heavily across the front seats. Ties Piper's bandanna around his head, covers his now gaping eye. 
EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - CRASH SITE 
Man with Wig hasn't had enough yet. He aims the rifle. Moves into the road. Can't see Milton in the car, but that doesn't matter. He knows he's there. 
BLAM. 
INT. GTO - DAWN 
The windshield SHATTERS. Glass splinters down on Milton. He reaches for the keys. 
INT. RV - DAY 
Jonah glances through the back window. Double takes. 
HIS POV A rapidly growing black blotch on the road. In seconds that blotch reveals itself as the GTO ripping up the highway, gaining fast. The baby SCREAMS in the background. When Jonah speaks...it is with wonder. 
JONAH KING Look at this. He's still coming. 
TATTOO Who's still coming? 
JONAH KING The old man. He's alive. 
TATTOO AND PIPER What? Piper tries to stand. Business Woman backhands her! 
BUSINESS WOMAM Stay down! That's impossible! 
TATTOO You shot him in the face! He can't-- 
JONAH KING Don't you see? We stand at the crossroads! Did you think we would just idly change the world? The forces of evil challenge us! This is wonderful! We show ourselves to be worthy. I'm so very proud of each one of you. Tattoo and Business Woman beam. Skanky pulls her tit out, shoves it in the baby's face. The kid goes quiet as -- The back glass SHATTERS. Everyone ducks! 
EXT. GTO - DAY 
Milton leans out the driver's side with the shotgun in his left hand, his one good eye squinting as -- 
KAFOOM! He fires at the RV! He RATCHETS another shell into the chamber, takes aim then...hesitates... 
IN REARVIEW The front end of a fast approaching vehicle! 
WHAM! 
Milton's head snaps back as a 90 Corvette slams into the back of the GTO. 
EXT. 90 CORVETTE - DAY 
Lady in Leopardskin behind the wheel, her eyes insane. Behind the Corvette we see a â92 Lincoln, Thin Old Man driving. Truck Driving Woman in a â95 Viper. 
INT. GTO - DAY 
Milton struggles to pull the shotgun back inside...struggles to keep the big GTO on the road. Distracted by the newcomers...we see what Milton does not. 
THROUGH WINDSHIELD The RV pulls off the road to the left. Milton looks up just as he passes the turn off. 
MILTON Shit! He SLAMS on his brakes. 
INT. 90 CORVETTE - DAY 
Leopardskin's eyes go wide. Survival kicks in. She jerks the wheel. 
EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - THE CHASE - DAY 
The Corvette slams into the side of the Viper! The Lincoln cuts hard right. All three cars shoot pass the GTO. Milton cuts the wheel left and floors it! 
INT. RV - DAY 
Piper on top, Jonah's face looks like he ran into a barbed wire fence! He howls in pain and manages to slip a hand around her throat! Piper feels it. His fingers tighten. He shoves her away from him...she can no longer dig into his face. Her arms flail. Reaching for anything. Grasping. Her face turns red. Eyes bulge. Fuck. She claws his shirt open. And there...hanging around his neck is a small corkscrew. Chinese in design. She snatches it and -- 
SHUNK! Stabs it into Jonah's shoulder, twists it deeper in. He SCREAMS. Releasing her! 
EXT. DIRT PATH - HILL TOP - DAY 
Quiet. 
FOOM! GTO rockets over the hill top, clears the ground ten feet! The moment the GTO touches down, Milton BRAKES! Milton JOLTS the car into reverse! Tires SCREAM in protest! 
The GTO jerks backwards...climbing toward the top of the hill in reverse when Milton SNAPS the wheel. The GTO 180s, comes to rest just on this side of the hilltop. Milton casually leans out of the driver's side window with the shotgun in hand. He points it skyward as-- 
FOOM! The Lincoln ROCKETS over the hilltop...and passes directly over the top of Milton. Milton's one good eye zeroes in on the massive gas tank beneath the back of the car. Milton squeezes the trigger. The back end of the Lincoln EXPLODES as -- --The Corvette rockets over the hilltop! 
INT. CORVETTE - DAY 
Lady in Leopardskin's face drops. 
THROUGH WINDSHIELD The Lincoln fireball SLAMS into the ground before her! Lady in Leopardskin shields her face as -- 
EXT. DIRT PATH - HILL TOP - DAY 
KER-FWAM! She slams into the burning vehicle and spins out of control! 
INT. GTO - DAY 
Milton kicks the car into drive, jerks a 180 and speeds off toward the RV. 
INT. RV - DAY 
Jonah sits up...he pulls at the corkscrew and screams. It won't budge. He glares at Piper. 
She scans for a weapon. Nothing. She snatches an umbrella from a coat rack. It'll have to do... There's a machete hanging beneath it. She drops the umbrella grabs the machete. Smiles at Jonah. 
PIPER Give me the baby and I'll make the pain go away. Suddenly everyone SLAMS into the side of the RV! 
EXT. RV - DAY 
Tattoo pulls the RV back onto Highway 70! 
INT. RV - DAY 
Piper clings to the old stove. She watches in horror as -- Jonah's gun slides from beneath the foldaway bed. It slides right up to him. He snatches it. Piper leaps through the door. 
INT. GTO - DAY 
Milton is gaining as -- 
THROUGH WINDSHIELD Piper swings out, clinging to the door for dear life! 
EXT. RV - DAY 
Piper SLAMS into the side of the RV. She tries desperately to hold on as -- Jonah leans through the door. Gun in hand. 
MILTON I know, baby. I know. Jonah only had about twenty followers. We hurt him good today. 
PIPER Fuckin devil worshipers freak me out. They mess with powers that should be left alone. Turns my shit white. 
MILTON Powers. It's all bullshit. 
PIPER No, Milton. It's real. Ghosts, UFOs, bigfoot, that's the bullshit. The Devil and demons? Once those doors are opened you're fucked. Milton rolls his one good eye. Piper turns back to the GTO. Smoke hissing from the engine. 
PIPER What do we do now? 
MILTON I used to know a guy lived out this way. You got one of them portable phones? 
PIPER Portable phones? You mean a cell phone? Yeah, in my bag. 
EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - CRASH SITE - DAY 
WE ARE CLOSE ON THE CRACKED EARTH As a hand slams into view, fingers with dirt crusted nails curl...dig into the ground. 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL Man With Wig crawls toward us. He's pale. Eyes dim. 
PULL BACK FURTHER TO REVEAL 
His busted, mangled legs have left a slug trail of blood and fluid stretching back to the highway. Left hand hits the ground, right hand digs into the dirt. He drags himself forward a few inches. 
HIS POV He's crawling toward the Station Wagon. Someone...somewhere...is HUMMING Wig turns, squints. 
A SILHOUETTE APPROACHES Back lit by the early day sun. There's a bounce in his step. Wig holds his hand out to the savior as-- The Accountant's smiling face becomes clear. 
ACCOUNTANT Scorcher today, huh? He takes a big long swing from an oversized water bottle. 
MAN WITH WIG Help me... 
ACCOUNTANT Christ on a cracker. My apologies. The Accountant grabs the man by the collar and drags him into the shade of the Station Wagon where he flips him around into a sitting position. Wig's shirt falls open revealing a pentagram tattooed above his left breast. 
ACCOUNTANT What's that supposed to mean? 
MAN WITH WIG It's a symbol of our pact with Lord Satan. 
ACCOUNTANT Pact huh? That's cute. Funny he's never mentioned you. Wig stares down at his mangled legs. The Accountant notices. 
ACCOUNTANT Yeah, those are fucked. Here, have some water. Wig takes the offered water as Accountant kneels before him. 
ACCOUNTANT Milton's work I take it? 
MAN WITH WIG Ran me over with his...how do you...? Who are you? 
ACCOUNTANT I'm the Accountant. I'm curious. And I never get curious. What do you people want with Milton? 
MAN WITH WIG You're the who? The Accountant smiles, places his hand around Wig's clearly shattered femur and squeezes. Wig's body convulses! He SCREAMS. 
ACCOUNTANT Does it matter? Milton. Why is he important to you? 
MAN WITH WIG He isn't! He's the one chasing us! 
PIPER Back? Back from where? What. The Fuck. Are you two talking about?! 
WEBSTER It true they took the little one? Milton nods. Webster considers for a long beat, then releases the .44. 
WEBSTER Put her in neutral. I'll pull the truck around. But Piper can't tear her eyes away from Milton. 
EXT. BULL BY THE BALLS BAR AND GRILL - DAY 
Police tape, half a dozen state and county cruisers. Three meat wagons and a news van. Humans buzz the scene like insects. The two dead State Troopers lie where they fell. Undisturbed. ROOKIE stands out. Young, county uniform, wide eyed. Very busy at having no idea what he should be doing. He scans the ground. His eyes go even wider. 
ROOKIE Sarge! Sarge look at this! Rookie squats to the ground as SARGE, leather skin, approaches, stares, frowns. 
SARGE Yeah? 
ROOKIE Cigarette butt. 
SARGE I see that. 
ROOKIE Sarge! It's less than twenty feet from the victims! 
SARGE And less than three feet from the ash bin. Sarge points to an ash bin filled with sand. Over a hundred cigarette butts salute the sky. 
SARGE Pay attention, Rookie. But Rookie's attention has quickly OCD'd elsewhere. 
ROOKIE Hey! 
HIS POV CAP, an American Indian man walks the crime scene. Jeans, cowboy boots, a âDumbledore Dies On Page 596â sweatshirt. His dress may look out of place but his face and attitude are all business. 
ROOKIE You! You can't be here! Rookie rushes forward. 
SARGE Rookie! 
ROOKIE Sarge, this joker can't just stomp around the crime scene. Sarge catches up, nods with respect to Cap. 
SARGE Captain. Sorry about that. Cap looks up then stares at Rookie's feet. 
CAP One of yours? 
SARGE Yessir, I won't let it happen again. 
CAP Get him out of here. 
SARGE Cap, he's green, that's all. 
CAP He's standing on evidence. Rookie leaps back revealing two shell casings. Cap kneels, stares. 
CAP 
Suddenly a Unformed Officer leans from within the bar. 
UNIFORMED OFFICER Cap! We got a live one. 
INT. BULL BY THE BALLS BAR AND GRILL - DAY 
The sun's setting to the West. Milton stands dangerously close to the fire. Stares at the dancing flames. 
WEBSTER (O.S.) That fire makin you homesick? Piper and Webster approach with a six pack. 
WEBSTER Cold beer? Milton gazes up at the moon. It isn't full but it's close. The fire CRACKLES, POPS. He stares at it. 
MILTON You know the pain and suffering ain't the worse part, right? That's what they tell ya, what they want you to believe. But it's all a big fuckin lie. Nosir, worst part's the goddamn video feed. Webster and Piper exchange a glance. 
MILTON It ain't about the fire and brimstone. Ain't about your suffering. It's about the suffering of them you love. Cuz you see it. You see it all. In full goddamn detail. And there ain't nothin you can do about it. Milton chunks a 2x4 into the fire. Sparks SWIRL into the air. 
MILTON Fuckin son-in-law. He looked like one of them tree-huggin piece of shits. Wore sandals. What kind of man wears fuckin sandals? 
(MORE) 
MILTON (CONT'D) 
(A BEAT) But I saw how he died. Fought like a fuckin banshee. Milton goes quiet. 
MILTON He loved that daughter of mine. Loved that little baby too. He kept fightin long after he should'a been dead. But some people's better at killin than others. Just how they're wired. Milton's finding it harder to speak. 
MILTON Then them sons of bitches turned on my...nosir, physical pain is nothin compared to watching your baby girl...watchin those fuckers...I'm gonna kill'em. I'm gonna kill'em all. And...and then I'll be done. Milton finally goes silent. Piper makes a noise. Involuntary. Tears stream down her cheeks. She's trying not to sob. Webster looks steely. Determined. 
WEBSTER Milton, I can't fix that car. But I can get you were you need to be. 
INT. WEBSTER'S GIANT BARN - NIGHT 
A huge sliding barn door opens into a giant stall revealing a 1969 Chevrolet Nova 396 L-78 and a 1969 Chevrolet Camaro. Milton and Piper stare. Webster smiles. 
WEBSTER Milt, if memory serves you were always partial to the Nova, yes? 
EXT. WEBSTER'S GIANT BARN - DISTANT RIDGE - NIGHT 
We're staring down over the barn from a distant ridge as we hear the GLASS-PACKED RUMBLE of the Nova's engine. 
MOVE TO REVEAL 
JONAH standing on the ridge top, cell phone to his ear. 
JONAH KING Yeah, about that fella who killed all them people at the Bull by the Balls last night. The fella who killed two of your cops. I know where you can find him. 
EXT. WEBSTER'S GIANT BARN - DAWN 
The sun rises to the east burning off the Utah dew. 
INT. WEBSTER'S GIANT BARN - CAR STALL - DAWN 
Milton crosses to the 69 Nova. Stops. Stares. 
HIS POV Piper is curled up beneath a quilt in the front seat. 
MILTON What are you doing? Piper pops awake, sits up. Already angry. 
PIPER Fuck are you doing?! Milton stares. 
PIPER I never knew him. Momma said he was a drifter. 
MILTON I ain't your daddy. 
PIPER Fuck you if you are. Milton notices something in the rear view. 
MILTON Shit. Piper sits up, stares. 
THROUGH BACK GLASS There's a State Trooper's car way back there. Fuck. There are two. No lights yet but they are coming up fast. 
PIPER What do we do? 
MILTON Nothing yet. Not until... The lights come on. 
PIPER Oh shit. They know. 
MILTON We can't stop. Milton mashes the peddle to the floor. 
PIPER Milton, this will never work. 
MILTON It'll work. 
PIPER No. It won't. Nobody gets away anymore. In fifteen minutes there will be choppers, we'll be all over the news... She breaks off. Her mouth drops. 
THROUGH WINDSHIELD As the NOVA tops a ridge, in the distance we see a police barricade. Several State Trooper Cruisers line the roadway in front of a bridge crossing a dry ravine. Cruisers line the side of the road. 
EXT. HIGHWAY 50 - DRY RAVINE BRIDGE - DAY 
Twenty cruisers. Thirty TROOPERS are set up behind their vehicles, shotguns and assault rifles in hand. 
Cap, the American Indian Police Captain, stands in front, a radio to his mouth. 
CAP Just keep driving him to us. We'll do the rest. And make sure you peel off before the fireworks. He lowers the handset, addresses the men. 
CAP Gentlemen, these two killed two of our own. I know you'd like them to pay. Therefore, when I tell you to aim for the tires, what I mean is aim for their heads. Are we clear? The men nod with steely determination. 
CAP Very good. Please aim for the tires. 
INT. 69 NOVA - DAY 
The barricade is approaching stupidly fast. For the first time on this adventure, Milton looks...concerned. 
PIPER Just don't stop. 
MILTON Too many of them. 
PIPER Just keep driving. 
MILTON I'm...I'm sorry I got you into-- 
PIPER --They took your granddaughter, Milton, and now these badge-wearing fuckers are trying to stop you. You crawled out of the Goddamn abyss...and a few fat-assed county Mounties are giving you pause? Your grand-baby needs you. Milton nods. Turns back to the road. 
PIPER You know what happens to her if they stop us. 
HIS POV Piper sits on the hood of the Nova next to the Accountant. 
MILTON Get away from her. 
ACCOUNTANT I think not. 
MILTON I shoot you with this, you know what it means. No heaven. No hell. You cease to exist. 
ACCOUNTANT All the more reason to keep Ms. Piper in close proximity. You are old, Milton. You might miss again. 
MILTON You can't stop me. 
ACCOUNTANT Stop you? Milton, you wouldn't be here without me, you ungrateful shit. That roadblock back there, that would have stopped you. So I want you to drop that iron God- Killer and say thank you. Milton stares. The Accountant, moves. Quickly. With a crisp flick, suddenly there's a blade at Piper's throat. She GASPS. 
ACCOUNTANT I said, drop it and thank you. Milton puts up his hand, flings the revolver into the darkness behind him. 
MILTON Don't hurt her. Th-Thank you. 
ACCOUNTANT That's better. He lowers the blade, but keeps Piper close. 
ACCOUNTANT You're not the first to get out and I doubt you'll be the last but I gotta know, HOW did you get out with the God-Killer? 
MILTON 
(CHUCKLES) I just walked in and took it. 
ACCOUNTANT You did not. 
MILTON I'm an old washed up lifer. Never occurred to'em that I was up to no good. 
ACCOUNTANT Wouldn't wanna be you when he finds out. 
MILTON What's he gonna do? Not let me back in? Now, I gotta know. Why? Why help me? 
PIPER I know why. It's because of those crazy fucks out there isn't it? They figured something out didn't they? Somehow they know how to summon a piece of hell to earth. The Accountant laughs. 
ACCOUNTANT That's cute. You haven't told her? 
MILTON She don't listen. 
ACCOUNTANT Young Ms. Piper, let you in on a little secret. The Dark Lord? Satan? Beelzebub? Lucifer? Simply the warden of a very large prison. Quiet man, actually. Thoughtful. Well read. I happen to know the idea of sacrificing children in his honor annoys him greatly. 
MILTON Then why? Why help me? 
ACCOUNTANT Simple. Like the warden, we all have jobs to do. Getting you here makes my job easier. You get what you want, I get what I want. 
MILTON Then help me, now. There are forty of them down there. You and I could-- 
ACCOUNTANT --No. 
MILTON 
BUT--

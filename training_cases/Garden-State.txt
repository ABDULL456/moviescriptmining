IN BLACK: 
AIRPLANE PILOT (O.S.) (panicky; through crackly 
RADIO) Los Angeles Tower, this is Transworld two-two Heavy, we are going down! Repeat... Engines two and three are... L.A. Tower this is MaydayI Mayday! 
TOWER (O.S.) (through crackly radio) 2-2 Heavy, Pull upt Pull up! The RADIO NOISE is drowned out by the A CAPELLA, SOPRANO VOICE of a young Indian boy as he sings a melodic Hindi prayer. 
INT. AIRPLANE CABIN --- NIGHT 
THE WORST NIGHTMARE IMAGINABLE: SLOW MOTION: The plane is going down fasts Everyone panics and screams in SLOW MOTION as the oxygen masks away like plastic pendulums. The SOPRANO VOICE continues the prayer. 
ANDREW LARGEMAN (LARGE), 25, is the only passenger who remains unfazed. Even as the flames from the wing echo fiery reflections on his cheeks, even as the young mother seated next to him clutches her newborn and wails towards God, even as bags fall from the overhead compartment at half-speed and the beverage cart slides down the aisle, Andrew Largeman sits peacefully; unaffected. 
He calmly reaches up and turns his air vent so it blows directly on him. He looks up to 
THE FASTEN SEAT BELT SIGN 
it BINGS as the light flashes on and off. The BINGING continues more and more frequently; at first in rhythm with the prayer and then it dissolves into the RING of an 
ELECTRONIC TELEPHONE. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. BEDROOM -- MORNING 
Whiteness. Morning sun streams through a palatial picture window. THE PHONE continues to RING. A ceiling fan spins above stacks of scripts, a cell phone charging, bare walls and a small human figure dwarfed by the enormous white bed in which he sleeps. 
HIS BYES bounce back and forth under their lids as he dreams like they're chasing each other in a game of tag. THE PHONE is finally answered by the machine. Large's eyes stop moving. 
VOICE ON MACHINE (0.S.) Andrew... This is your father. LARGE'S EYES slowly float open. 
VOICE Hi, hello, it's uh. Look uh, you don't call me back so I don't know how to do this. If I can't... if you're not gonna return my calls then there's no way for us to communicate. So uh... '(starts to cry) 
Look, I don't know how to do . this, but you're gonna need to come home now. Last night uh... Your mother died last night, Andrew. She uhh... I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. But she uh... she drowned... last night she drowned in the bath... 
BEEP. The machine cuts the voice off. LARGE'S EYES processing. 
They elide slowly left, then back right as if scanning in data. He blinks. He blinks again slowly. His eyelids float closed. He falls back to sleep. 
FADE TO BLACK-' 
IN BLACK: The RUSH OF WATER from the bathroom sink. 
INT. BATHROOM -- MORNING 
Large appears to stare directly at us. He's dazed. His body is there, but his mind seems absent. He reaches to the middle of the frame, almost at us, and pulls open both doors of the mirror he's been staring into. 
His face and chest are immediately replaced with the two dozen orange prescription drug canisters that immaculately line the shelves of his medicine cabinet. 
He closes the mirror doors and stares at himself. 
MUSIC CUB., ("DON'T PANIC" BY COLDPLAY) 
EXT. CENTURY CITY PAVILION -- LATER 
Large rushes through throngs of people on their lunch break. He manages to avoid eye contact with all of them as he tries to find an address while checking a piece of paper. He boards an outdoor escalator and starts climbing thL- stairs. 
After a moment he looks to his right through a window into a gym where a man on a Stairmaster is walking alongside him. Large registers something: he isn't going anywhere. 
THE CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal he's been walking up on the down side. He stands still and lets it bring him all the way down, where he moves to the "Up" one and rises towards the next level. His expression never changes. 
INT. CASTING OFFICE -- DAY 
A casting assistant sits behind stacks of headshots and manilla envelopes while the PHONE RINGS constantly. Large sits next to another actor that looks exactly like him; they're even dressed alike. 
ASSISTANT Casting, please hold. casting, please hold. 
WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL: they are sitting beneath an eight foot photograph of "Urkel" wagging his finger at the camera. A slow 360 degree pan around the room reveals ten other actors identical to Large aggressively rehearsing their lines to themselves. 
The ACTOR seated next to Large leans over to him. 
(BEAT) Well something to chew on --fuck. Bamboo... whatever. 
LARGE I'll see what I can find. He turns and walks off . 
VIETNAMESE VOICE (O.S.) Waiter number twelve, flight number 121 with non-stop service to Newark International will be departing from gate D-32. 
ON LARGE'S FACE CLOSE as he closes his eyes and we: 
FADE TO BLACK: 
IN BLACK: THE BLARE OF A JET LINER TARING OFF dissolves into 
INT. AIRPORT BATHROOM -- DAY 
THE RUSH OF WATER as Large washes his hands at the last Oink in a very long row. He grabs his neck while SQUINTING his eyes closed in pain for a brief second. A moment later he picks up his bag and heads down the line of sinks. As he passes each sink, he unknowingly activates their motion sensors and each faucet SHOOTS a tiny burst of water. The NASALLY VOICE of a WOMAN SINGING an off key version of "Once, Twice, Three Times A Lady" with synthesizer accompaniment. 
EXT. CEMETERY - DAY 
A large group of people are gathered around a steel coffin. Atop the coffin site a framed picture of a tired looking woman in a wheelchair. This is SARAH LARGEMAN. We find SYLVIA LARGEMAN, the source of the music. CLOSE ON HER FACE as the assorted palette of colored make-up on her cheeks swirls together with tears until it collects on the tip of her chin and drips like a leaky faucet onto: HER LYRICS SHEET as a rainbow of tears splatter the words "ONCE and "TWICE". The song finishes and the rabbi begins a series of Hebrew prayers. Large squints through the mourners to see his father GIDEON LARGEMAN shovel a handful of dirt onto the casket. Behind him stands CYNTHIA DILLARD, 25, a beautiful young Black woman. HIS FOCUS RACKS TO REVEAL two young men seated on a rusty tractor smoking cigarettes about thirty yards behind the ceremony. WE JUMP CUT TO after the ceremony as Large weaves through the crowd and approaches the two men. We see now they are HA-RKs 26, good looking in a dirty way. And DAVE, 26. They are quite filthy, but each sports expensive jewelry and black yarmulkes. They look up as Large approaches. 
MARX 
HOLY SHITS 
LARGE T'sup. 
DAVE Holy shit! 
MARK Largeman, what the hell are you doin' here?

LARGE Yeah, definitely. They stand there; nodding.

KENNY Shut the fuck upf Course not. 
(BEAT) But you got to put your helmet on, man; leading cause of death on the highway for males in our age bracket. 
LARGE Okay. 
KENNY Wanna see my kid. He shows Large a picture in his wallet. 
LARGE You got a kid, too? Wow. 
KENNY Everybody's got kids now, man; they're great. It's like your own "Mini-Me"; way better than my cats,

LARGE Really? 
KENNY Cut him down myself. Seth. Did you know him?

LARGE Oh, that would be great... to see that. So I guess I'll see you then. 
KENNY Great seeing you, man. 
LARGE Yeah. You too. Benny gets in his car and pulls up alongside Large. He picks up the CB and the PA CRACKLES on: 
KENNY 
(OVER PA) Pull over, the vehicle! Kenny nods his head up and down to Large like "Isn't this cool?" Large waves goodbye. Kenny floors the cop car and BLARES the SIREN with LIGHTS FLASHING as be SCREECHES away. 
CUT TO: 
INT.GLEASON HOUSE - NIGHT 
Largeweaveshis way through a raging, crowded high-school styleparty:LOUD MUSIC, smoky, sweaty drunk people, kege- Mostof thepeople are 18 to 21. 
TNT.GLEASON KITCHEN --- NIGHT A bunch of people are gathered around Mark as he tells a drunken story. The group laughs. 
JESSE That's fucked up. 
LARGE Yeah... So I definitely wanna come by and check out your new pad. You gotta tell me what happened. 
JESSE Basically, "The Man bought my silent Velcro patent. 
LARGE What? 
JESSE Well you knew I was an inventor right? 
LARGE No. But I haven't seen you since we 
WERE SIXTEEN- 
JESSE Oh well yeah... I wasn't really an inventor yet. Anyway I developed this little item that's just like Velcro but doesn't make that annoying Velcro noise. 
LARGE now much did they buy it for? 
JESSE A lot. 
LARGE Wow. So what are you doing now? 
JESSE Nothing. They laugh. 
LARGE Seriously. 
JESSE Seriously. Absolutely nothing. I've never been so bored in all my life. The first month I bought a whole bunch of shit, but then that got boring. But I... nothing. 
LARGE That's so crazy. But I mean like, are you gonna travel or like what are you gonna do? Shouldn't you like help starving kids or something? 
JESSE I'm not really motivated to do much at all. It's kind of funny, I guess I had kind of planned on my whole life being about struggling to get money. But now that I've got more than I ever dreamed, I'm really not sure what to do with myself. I stare at walls a lot. 
DAVE Can you believe that shit, Large? This guy has one idea and he's a trillionaire. I got a thousand ideas, but I gotta sit around and wait for all my relatives to die. They join the group. Mark blows coke off a large golf book. Dave has a young girl on his lap. Large begins to notice that the girls in the room, although quite attractive, are pretty young; 17-19. As he pans the room, he lock eyes with a BEAUTIFUL YOUNG GIRL. They play chicken briefly to see who will break the stare first. Large does and looks to his right where someone has just passed him a joint- He hits it and passes it on. 
MARK Here, bro. He passes Large the golf book. 
LARGE Oh no thanks, man. 
MARK Really? But you're like a movie star and shit. 
LARGE No, no thanks. 
JESSE Well then here. Eat this. Jesse opens his palm to reveal a tiny hit of E with a SMILEY FACE on it. 
JESSE (CONT'D) Welcome home. 
Large takes it in his hand and thinks about it. He looks around at everyone else in the room eating them; including the cute girls. 
LARGE I guess I'll see youguyslater. He eats the hit. They laugh. 
DANA Should we play a game? 
DAVE other than golf? They laugh. 
KELLY No, let's play Spin The Bottle. The idea is met with mixed reaction from the group. 
LARGE 
(TO JESSE) I'm not playing Spin The Bottle; how old are we? or more importantly, how old are they? Jesse passes Large the joint. 
JESSE They're all legal. I think. He smiles a toothy grin. KELLY, a young hot girl with a raspy voice takes control. 
KELLY Well we just ate all this fuckin' ex, what the hell else are we gonna do? 
JESSE The girl has a point. 
MARK Okay, how 'bout this. He holds up a bottle of Tequila with a ribbon around !.to neck. 
MARK (CONT'D} First let's finish Daddy's golf tequila. Then we can use this bottle. The group loves this idea- As they laugh and party the CAIa.ERA FINDS ITS WAY to Large's face as he feels the weed and the beginning of his trip. His eyes and face navigate the ha3mnv start. 
THE REST OF THIS SCENE WILL VACILLATE BETWEEN REGULAR, SPED- 
UP AND SLOW MOTION. The party seems to fast forward around Large; the MUSIC FADES TO ONE LOW NOTE until it breaks with people calling his name. 
ALL Large! He snaps his attention to the game. The bottle is pointed directly at him. 
JESSE Largeman, this is Dana. Large looks over to the sexy young girl whom he locked eyes with before. She smiles at him. Awkwardness fills the room. 
LARGE What? 
TIM No, I can't. 
CAROL Yes, you can. 
MARK What the fuck is Klingon? 
LARGE Like the Star. Trek guys? 
CAROL Yup. He can talk in their language. 
TIM She's kidding. 
CAROL No, I'm not. He's being shy. Are you being shy? 
MARK Don't be shy, Tim. 
LARGE Yeah let's hear it, man? 
TIM It's just made up. The guy who plays the wizard at work is a Trekky. I don't really... 
CAROL He's being shy. Say what you said to me last night. 
TIM No. 
MARS Yeah, Tim. Say what you said to her last night. Silence. Everyone stares at Tim. 
TIM I gotta get going anyway. 
MARK 
(SHARP) Say what you said to her last night. 
TIM Kuntar peteeky maya. Al fook soo. They all stare at him. Then burst out laughing. 
MARK You've got to be kidding me. 
CAROL It means, "I like to mate after battle." 
TIM 
(QUICKLY) That's not what I said. 
CAROL Yes. 
TIM No, that wasn't the one I said. This one means "kill Kirk" and also 'hallelujah" depending on the context. 
MARK You must have gotten it confused with "Pleej artulyah. Hagtooth pleep." Theylaugh. 
CAROL That was good, honey. 
MARK You know what that means, Tim? 
TIM No I don't know the whole language, I just... 
MARK well I do. It means get the fuck out of my house before I chop your fuckin' head off. Silence. Large stares at Mark in disbelief, then starts to LAUGH. They all start to join him except Mark. They stop laughing. 
CAROL Mark, he's a knight. 
MARK He's just a fast-food knight. 
TIM I should get going anyway. He gets up to leave. But his sword gets caught between his chair and the table. They all watch as he fumbles to undo himself. He's like John Ritter at his finest. Large and Mark just laugh. 
TIM (CONT'D) Thanks for the cereal. By the way, it says "balls" on your face. Carol follows Tim out. Large slides to the microwave door's reflection. 
LARGE 
YOU ASSHOLE: 
MARK My Mom did it. 
CUT TO: 
IT. MARK'S LIVING ROOM -- LATER Mark and Large sit captivated by ALLIGATORS EATING ZEBRAS on TV. Large's forehead is now merely smeared with black ink. Mark leans forward to pull a bong hit from a blackened, colored tube. He coughs out his hit and reclines his bare back against the torn pleather couch. Carol enters and stands next to them watching the TV. 
CAROL What's this? She finds a long, thin cigarette with lipstick on it in the ashtray and lights it. 
(TIGHT WHISPER) Stop it. Heel. No thrust. Finally Large gives up and decides to just let it hump away- He tries to return to his paperwork. Someone BURSTS OUT LAUGHING. Large turns to see a cute 20 year old GIRL he hadn't seen sitting in the corner. She wears really big headphones. 
LARGE (CONT'D) Got any suggestions? 
GIRL Kick his balls. 
MRS- LUSTN Ready for me? 
The girl and Large look to each other, the receptionist is gone. 
GIRL 
(IMPERSONATING 
RECEPTIONIST) Not yet Mrs. Lubin. The dog humps away. The girl comes over and sits one seat away from Large. 
GIRL (CONT'D) 
(SOFTLY) Kick his balls. 
LARGE I don't want to hurt him. 
GIRL It's the only way to teach them. I have three Dobermans. If I didn't kick them in the balls regularly I'd never get anything done. 
LARGE Yeah, but I don't want to like destroy future generations of charitable dogs. Besides he's got to be close to finishing by now. 
GIRL Not yet, here comes the lipstick. They sit and watch him go. 
GIRL (CONT'D) Oh, he's gonna be sore tomorrow. WIDE SIDE ANGLE ON: the whole waiting room. Everything still but the dog's thrusting pelvis. 
RECEPTIONIST Mrs. Lubin? 
MRS. LUBIN Yes. 
RECEPTIONIST We're ready for you. 
MRS. LUBIN Okay. C'mon Arthur. Arthur immediately responds to her voice and returns to her side to lead her into the office. 
LARGE I feel so used. 
She laughs. 
LARGE (CON2''D) Thanks for your help. Or at least your good intentions. 
SAM I recognize you. 
LARGE Oh, did you go to Columbia High? 
SAM No, not from high school, from TV. Didn't you play the retarded quarterback. 
LARGE (Wishing she'd go away) Yeah. 
SAM Are you really retarded? He stares at her. 
LARGE No. 
SAM That's cool. Great job, man. You were- I mean I thought you were really retarded. You were just as good as that corky kid and he's really retarded. I mean if there's some kind of like retarded Emmy you could win. You'd kick Corky's ass. 
LARGE I got to fill this thing out, but thank you for... that. 
SAM Oh, okay. Right on. My cousin's an actor. Jake Ryan Winters. I doubt you'd know him. He was on "Sheena" once as some gnome or something. I think that's great though. 
LARGE Thank you. 
SAM Oh that last scene where you make that speech to the whole stadium and your Dad gives you the thumbs up; that was - it was emotional. I mean I didn't cry, but I think my Dad did. 
(MORE) 
I couldn't totally see, but he got up to go to the bathroom and I think I heard him sniffle. Could've been dander... 
LARGE Well thanks. Thank you. 
SAM So are you doing anything else? 
LARGE No. Not right now I'm just... 
SAM Any other retarded roles? I'm sure you could definitely get more of those. 
DOCTOR I'm sorry about you're Mother. 
LARGE Yeah. Thank you. 
DOCTOR I must have missed you at Shiva last night. 
LARGE Yeah. 
DOCTOR So how long have these headaches been going on? 
LARGE Well I think I've had them in some form since I was a little kid. But they've been getting more and more frequent over the last year. 
DOCTOR (looking at chart) How long have you been on the Lithium? 
LARGE Oh uh, I've been on some form of it since I was ten or so. 
DOCTOR And what about Paxil, Zoloft, Celexa, Depakote; did any of that ever help you? 
LARGE No. I mean I don't know. It's recently occurred to me that I might not even have a problem. only I'd never know it, because as far back as I can remember I've been medicated. I grew up on it. I left them in LA. This is the first time I haven't had it in my body since I can remember. 
DOCTOR Well it'll leave your body pretty fast. I'll write you a prescription. 
LARGE Actually I. was thinking about taking a little vacation. 
DOCTOR Have you spoken to your psychiatrist about that? 
LARGE E)h well, my psychiatrist is my Dad. So uh... he... I think he'd prefer me to stay on it. He likes to think it makes me happy. And I let him think that because he's sort of consumed by the idea of making everyone happy. 
DOCTOR Well look, I'll examine you and give you a Catscan just so you won't worry that it's anything serious. But to be honest, I think the headaches are something else. Our bodies do very funny things when they're consumed with stress and anxiety. Things you'd never expect. I found my ex-best friend's cuff links in my wife's puree and I couldn't get an erection for a year and a half. 
(BEAT) For example. 
LARGE But that doesn't really feel like it. I mean I don't feel stressed or really anxious at all. 
DOCTOR Well with all the Lithium he's had you on it's amazing you can even hear me right now_ 
LARGE Oh, right. 
DOCTOR First of all, I do think you need to find a psychiatrist that isn't your father. That just's something that should have been remedied years ago. He knows better. Secondly, I'm not in a position to comment on whether or not you should stay on the meds or not; I don't know your story. But my opinion, since you're paying for it, is that those drugs may help as a means to an end. But if you're not In any sort of therapy, sooner or later what's ever going on in your mind will find a way to peek it's little head out of the water. Just something to think about. 
(MORE) 
,beat) But, for now, let's have a look at you. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CATSCAN ROOM - LATER 
MUSIC PLAYS AN OVERHEAD SHOT OF: Large staring at the wall as he lies on a white slab covered from the waist down by a white towel. AN OLD FEMALE NURSE straps him to the slab ignoring the OBSCENE WORDS and DRAWINGS in black marker that cover his chest. THE CAMERA CRANES DOWN to reveal Large and the slab being sucked.into the Catscan tunnel. 
EXT. PARKING LOT -- DAY 
Large drives out of the parking lot. There, seated at the bus stop is Sam bobbing her head to music- She wears a backpack and holds an odd looking helmet in her hand. He pulls up alongside her. 
LARGE Why were you really there? 
SAM Charging. I'm a robot. 
LARGE Do you lie a lot? 
SAN What do you consider a lot? 
LARGE Enough for people to call you a liar. 
SAM People call me lots of things. 
LARGE Is one of them "liar"? 
SAM I could say "no", but how will you know I'm not lying. 
LARGE Because I`ll choose to trust YOU. 
SAM You can do that? 
LARGE I can try. 
SAM Who's bike is this? 
(BEAT) He might drive a bike; wherever he is. 
LARGE Well we're off to a great start. 
SAM okay so sometimes I lie. I'm weird, man. About random stuff too; and I don't even know why I do it. It's like a tick. I swear, sometimes I hear myself say something and then I think: "Wow, that's not even remotely true. 
LARGE So how am I supposed to know what's real? 
SAM Well, I always feel bad and admit them when they're lies. 
(BEAT) Can you trust that? 
LARGE Open the door. 
TNT. SAM'S HOUSE: FOYER -- CONTINUOUS She pushes the front door open and immediately three enormous Doberman Pinchers BARK and CLIMB all over Large. 
SAM Down, Kevin! Mom! Kick their balls! Kick their balls! Anthrax, heel! Mom! Sam tries slapping them on their backs. OLIVIA, Sam's mother, comes rushing in clutching a hamster with a bloody nose. 
OLIVIA Everybody downl Who wants to eat? Do you want to eat? Well then get the fuck off him! Kevin! Steven! 
GET OFF[ She smacks their asses and they eventually retreat to the other room. 
OLIVIA (CONT' D) I'm so sorry, we just don't have the time to train' em. Who has time to train'em? When they were puppies it was cute, but now it's like having a herd of Clydesdales. It's just too much. 
(MORE) 
Kevin's the baby, he really just follows the others but last week Anthrax and Steven killed a dove and left him on the front porch. Or maybe it was a pigeon, he was grey. 'Member that, Samantha? 
SAM Mom, this is .Andrew... 
OLIVIA Welcome, welcome. The place is a wreck, I'm so sorry. You look very familiar. 
SAM He's the retarded quarterback. 
OLIVIA Shut up ! Oh my God ! You are the retarded quarterback. You were so good on that show. Now I'm really ashamed. Look at this place. And I'm wearing sweat pants. (to Sam, through her teeth, while nodding at 
LARGE) is he really retarded? 
LARGE No. 
OLIVIA Oh, tell me, what's that Alan Thicke like? I've heard he's a cocky son of a bitch. 
LARGE No, he's a really nice guy. 
OLIVIA Oh. Well, welcome, welcome. Samantha I told you to take the wheel out of the hamster cage. She holds up a dead hamster. 
SAKI I forgot, Mom. 
OLIVIA Well you forgot and now Jelly's dead. Luckily I got peanut Butter out in time. 
(TO LARGE) We have to get the only hamster on planet Earth that can't figure out a stupid hamster wheel. Now the rest of 'am can't even get a good sweat going. 
(MORE) 
There's a shoe box on the kitchen counter. You can do the honors. I have to run to work. She sighs and absentmindedly pate her forehead with the hamster. 
OLIVIA (CONT'D) It was so nice to meet you... Andrew right? 
LARGE Yes. 
OLIVIA Samantha put the clothes in the dryer and bury Jelly. She kisses Sam on the cheek and then she's gone. They stand there a moment to catch their breath. Then they both start laughing. 
SAM Come on in. They walk into the LIVING ROOM. 
INT. LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS 
Big couches with tattered afghans on them. A Christmas tree with the lights on in the far corner; a few unwrapped presents underneath. An enormous hamster labyrinth, a fish tank, three cats, a bird cage. 
SAM So this is it. 
LARGE It's nice. 
SAM No it's not. You don't have to say that just 'cause you can't think of anything else to say. 
LARGE I'm not. It's really nice. It's very cozy. You guys are a little early on the tree, huh? 
SAM Yeah, well we never got around to taking it down, so when it got to be fall again we just figured we might as well leave it. Are you freaked out? You're totally freaked out aren't you? 
LARGE It's like the Wailing Wall. 
SAM What? 
LARGE The Wailing Wall. It's like the most holy place for Jews to go and pray in Israel. It's all that's left of this enormous temple that was destroyed by the Romans. 
SAM Wow, so you're like really Jewish? Large laughs. 
SAM (CONT'D) Yeah, you are aren't you? 
LARGE No I'm not. I mean I'm Jewish, but I'm not really Jewish. I don't do anything Jewish. I don't go to temple or anything. But I don't know any Jews who go to temple. The Jews I know only go on Yom Kippur. One day; the day of repentance. Did you know that most temples are designed with movable walls so that on the one day of the year when â¢ everyone comes to repent they can actually make the room big enough to hold everyone? 
SAM I don't really believe in God. 
LARGE Just tickle. 
SAM Oh, I believe in Tickle_ They laugh. A nice moment. They hold eye contact. THE AWESOME 
MUSIC PLAYS. 
SAM (CONT'D) We're not gonna like make out or anything. 
LARGE What? 
SAM I'm sorry, I just totally ruined the moment didn't I? 
LARGE No, I wasn't... 
SAM I just mean we're not gonna like make out. 
LARGE Okay. I hadn't planned on... 
SAM I didn't mean to put that out there, that was lame. BLAAAAHRH. That was so dumb. You know what I do when I'm feeling completely unoriginal? She stands up and does really weird gestures with her hands. 
SAM (CONT'D) 
LABA-LABA-LABA-LABAL Large states. 
SAM (CONT ' D) I make a noise or I do something that no one has ever done. And then I feel like... unique again; even if only for a second. 
LARGE So no one has ever done that? 
SAM Not in this spot, no. You just witnessed a completely original moment in history. It's refreshing. You try one. 
LARGE No. 
SAM Come on. 
LARGE No. Trust me yours was good enough for both of us. 
SAM Come on. What are you shy? This is your chance to do something that has never, ever been done before and will never be copied throughout human existence. If nothing else, you'll be remembered as the only person who ever did this. He stares at her. She's not gonna let up. Large lifts his index finger in the air and twirlsa it. 
LARGE ZzzZzz. Be stares at her. 
LARGE (CONT'D) How was that? 
SAM Oh, I've done that one before. She bursts out laughing. He smiles. SAM (CONT ' t3 ) So I got to bury this hamster before the dogs eat him. You warms help? 
C'AM' TO: 
EXT. SAWS BACKYARD-- DAY 
Rusty leaves fall on a backyard swallowed mostly by an empty above-ground swimming pool. Sam carries the shoe box as they walk around behind the pool to reveal 
A SMALL GATED PET CEMETERY About a dozen large rocks serve as tombstones for different pets. 
LARGE Wow. 
SAM Yeah. 
LARGE I mean this is... 
SAM I know. They stand in silence. 
SAM (CONT'D) It's not that we're bad pet owners or anything, it's just that we've had so many of them over the years. 
(BEAT) Besides some of these are fish. 
THE LIVING ROOM A tired looking man in his 50's eating a cookie. 
TIRED MAN Avi wants his Bar Mitzvah theme to be musicals. As in Broadway musicals. Can you believe that? Paul's kid's theme was the Meta; I got to do the Elora with Mookie Wilson. Miriam and I were at one last weekend at the Pierre; whole thing was like a winter wonderland... live penguins wearing yalmulkas. Now me, I got to lay out ten grand alone for some asshole to build a barricade of French garbage across the boccie lanes at my tennis club. THE CAMERA PICKS UP LARGE holding a plate of food: as he approaches Cynthia. She sits alone with a big photo album on her lap. 
LARGE I was just thinking- 
(BEAT) I was just thinking you spend you're whole life lusting for anything you don't have. You stress over money and your career, you set your clocks back, you exercise, you wait in line, you paint your house, get depressed, feel better, buy things, take your clothes to the dry cleaner, set your clocks forward and spend your whole life waiting for happiness to arrive in the mail. Then you die and people are really sad, they cry really hard... 
(BEAT) and then they go eat lunch. Hetakes a bite of his bagel. 
CYNTHIA Oh please be a little more interesting than that. 
(MORE) 
Please don't be the brooding guy. That's so unoriginal. I'd rather hold onto who I imagined you'd become. 
LARGE Miss me? 
CYNTHIA No. Me? 
LARGE No. 
(BEAT) She didn't like being alive. She got what she wanted. This should be a party. Instead we're supposed to mope. About what? She never did anything. 
CYNTHIA She made you. 
LARGE some trophy. I do have to say I'm impressed with the turnout. 
CYNTHIA What, you didn't think people would come? 
LARGE Seems to me the only thing more depressing than a funeral is a funeral where no one shows up. Don't you ever think about who'll show up to yours? 
CYNTHIA No. Right now I'm alive, so I think about living. 
LARGE It's one way to determine who your friends are. The people who'd show up at my funeral if it was held in their state, that's one level of friend. But my real friends, the people who really love me, they'd come if it was on the other side of the country. 
CYNTHIA So where do I fall into that? 
LARGE You'd be there. 
CYNTHIA Oh you think so? 
LARGE I do. I think you'd show up because the truth is, that you really did miss met you always thought of me as the brother you never had. But you've got too much pride to let me know that. You want to pout 'cause I don't return your calls. 
CYNTHIA you're way more talkative than I remember. 
LARGE Today I've been more talkative than I remember. 
CYNTHIA What about mine? 
LARGE Funeral? Honestly? I probably wouldn't travel for it- no. But don't worry, I'm sure you'll have a great turnout. 
CYNTHIA Why do you say that? 
LARGE 'Cause there's also the guy who lives his life to insure a good turnout. I think that's how my Dad lives his-, like he's sort of writing his own eulogy as he goes and making life choices dependent on how it will sound in a speech. 
CYNTHIA Are you implying that that's why I'm going to med school or something? 
LARGE I'm just saying a lot of people - not necessarily you - a lot of people try and accumulate accolades that will somehow justify their lives. 
CYNTHIA It's said we spend ninety-five percent of our lives trying to look good. 
LARGE Where do I sign up for not caring? 
CYNTHIA How about sucking it up and really having it out with your Dad? That would be a tremendous step towards not needing to look good. 
LARGE Wow, that was so clever how you did that. Is he grooming you to be a psychiatrist too? Med school's one thing, but please don't become him. 
CYNTHIA He's one of the most caring people I've ever met. 
LARGE well you would say that; you're the son and daughter he never had. Hell, you're the family he never had. Has he got you on Lithium yet? Wait till he does, you'll love him even more. He stands. 
CYNTHIA I bet my Mom a dollar you were coming home with a message. I said after nine years, he's definitely coming home with a message. 
LARGE i looked for a message; I got bored and became an actor. He leaves. 
INT. KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS 
LARGE I'm not reading into this, I'm just thinking out loud so don't get 
UPSET- 
GIDEON What? No. 
LARGE What? 
GIDEON Its not that. 
LARGE I'm just saying did they check? I mean has someone ruled that out? 
GIDEON No. Because they know she drowned, Andrew. 
LARGE I'm just saying the facts. 
GIDEON No. 
LARGE And I suppose it doesn't even really matter. But I'd be curious to know. I would like to know if that's what happened; just for me. I mean would that surprise you? 
GIDEON No. Yee! 
LARGE She made it very clear to everyone she knew that nothing was ever going to make her happy- 
GIDEON I know! Do you think I don't know?! 
LARGE And c'mon let's be honest; she tried it before. 
GIDEON Shut-up! .lust shut your fucking mouth. Large is taken aback. 
GIDEON (CONT'D) 
(FIGHTING TEARS) If nothing else will you please just leave, her alone. She's gone. That's it. That's all you get. She died. We will never see her again. She tried very hard, but she just couldn't find it. She could never find it. And I think - I know that she's found it now. I know that. And I know there's a certain amount of guilt that you must feel for the way things unfolded, but it's too late now. 
(MORE) 
So I'm asking you, for me, not to do that. Don't... come here and do that. 
LARGE I think I deserve to know the truth. 
GIDEON You want to make her crazy. Why? Does that make it easier for you? Tears stream down Gideon's face, He sits down on the toilet and cries. 
GIDEON (CONT'D) It's like you want to torture yourself or something! Why would you want to think that? That that happened. Why would you ever want to think that? Large moves closer to his father who SOBS with his head in his lap and his arms over his head. It takes everything Large has to reach out his hand and almost touch his father's shoulder, but he doesn't make it and his hand lands on the sink next to him. 
GIDEON (CONT'D) I just want everyone to be happy again. 
(BEAT) I dreamt last night that I had special powers. If I squeezed my eyes shut and clinched my fiats closed tight enough, we'd all wake up in paradise. (with a laugh through 
TEARS) I was like a superhero... and that was my power. 
FADE TO BLACK: 
EXT. CEMETERY - DAY 
A giant rusted yellow tractor sits parked by an open grave- Large and Jesse lean against opposite tombstones facing each other. Mark stands in the open grave STEALING VALUABLES FROM AN OPEN COFFIN. A small PILE OF JEWELRY sits beside the grave. 
MARK How could you leave all that Lithium? I was totally gonna hit you up for some. 
FB 
JESSE This fuckin' guy. I'm glad you're back, man, because this town is so messed up. Everyone's got there drug of choice like in "Brave New World". Did you ever read that book? Who wrote that? Aldous something. Aldous- 
LARGE I don't know. Jesse continues talking, but his voice distorts into WARBLED 
NONSENSE AS SLOW MOTION: LARGE STARES in shock as Mark drops a WEDDING RING into the PILE OF JEWELRY he's stealing off the corpse. 
MARK LOOKS UP AT LARGE STARING AT HIM AND HIS LOOT. THEY HOLD EYE CONTACT FOR AN UNCOMFORTABLE MOMENT. Large breaks it and looks away. 
REGULAR MOTION: 
JESSE (O.S.) .and people are just like that here, man. Huxtable3 Aldous Huxtable. That's it. 
INT. SAM'S LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT 
Sam and Large are looking through a photo album. Olivia enters with an enormous Parrot on her shoulder. 
OLIVIA Andrew would you like to see Sam's ice skating tape? 
SAM Okay, good-night. (calling to Titembay) Night, Tim. 
LARGE Good-Night. 
TITEMBAY (0.5.) Rolla! 
INT. BAR -- NIGHT 
Sam and Large sit in a booth of a local Irish pub drinki ng pints. They're buzzed. 
LARGE It was the only thing I ever really liked doing; pretending to be someone else. 
(BEAT) But I've been so out of it the only parts I ever get offered are to play handicapped people. 
She tries to hold it together, but she bursts out laughing. 
LARGE (CONT'D) It's not funny. 
SAM Oh c'mon. Don't ya see that it's a joke. If you can't laugh at yourself life's gonna seem a lot longer than you'd like. 
LARGE So what should we laugh at you about? 
SAM I lied again. I have epilepsy. 
LARGE Which part are we laughing about? 
SAM I had a seizure in the law office where I work and they said their insurance would only cover me if I wore "preventative covering". 
LARGE Preventative covering? 
SAM The helmet I was carrying. Large is silent. 
SAM (CONT' D) Oh come on, that's funny. I'm the only person in the world wearing a helmet to work who isn't putting out fires or racing for NASCAR. But what do you do? I can't quit; their insurance is amazing. What can you do? You laugh. I'm not saying I don't cry a lot, but in between I laugh and realize how silly taking anything very seriously is. And plus, I look forward to a good cry. I just love the way it feels. 
LARGE I haven't cried since I was a little kid. I didn't cry at my mother's funeral. I wanted to- 
(A SMILE) I... tried. I thought of all the saddest things I could think of; things in movies, this image from Life magazine that haunts me... nothing came. 
(MORE) 
That actually made me sadder than anything; the fact that I felt no numb. 
SAM What do you mean? 
MARK (O. S.) Vagina! 
LARGE Oh, no. Mark, Dave and Jesse appear with some others. 
LARGE "(CONT'D) Hey, guys, this is Sam. This is Mark, Dave and you met Jesse. 
MARK Hey. Nice to meet you. 
JESSE Hey. 
DAVE T'sup. 
MARK I'm sorry I yelled- 'vagina' just now, I didn't see you. 
SAM It's okay. 
MARK Nice. Let's get fucked up. Off Large's smile we: 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. JESSE'S POOL -- NIGHT 
A palatial swimming pool in the backyard of Jesse's mans ion. The Manhattan skyline twinkles far in the distance. Large, Sam, Mark, Dave, Jesse and a couple of high school girls from the bar stand in their underwear on the edge of the pool. 
MARK One, two, three! Everyone jumps into the pool SCREAMING except for Large. He stands there staring at the water. 
SAM Hey! what are you doing? 
DAVE Largeman, get the fuck in the pool. 
GIRL oh, it's so warm! 
SAM Can you swim? 
JESSE You're like a little detective. 
LARGE I know. You and Titembay should go into business together; solve mysteries out of a van. 
SAM Am I being too nosey? 
LARGE No. No. I just... it's fine.. I just haven't ever really talked about it. 
JESSE To be honest, I never really knew either. I mean I heard stories. 
LARGE You wanna know? 
SAM Yeah. 
LARGE Really, really? 
MARK You're gay. 
LARGE No. Drumroll... I was the reason she was in a wheelchair. 
(BEAT) I pushed her. 
(MORE) 
(BEAT) So there that is. 
SAM Shut up. 
MARX Fuck you. 
LARGE No, it's the truth. 
SAM Why? 
LARGE It was a complete freak accident. I mean its one of those things that you replay a million times in your head and you see so clearly what a freak thing it was. I... Say whole life she was depressed for no reason. Look at this picture. He pulls the picture of he and Cynthia as children wearing chicken slippers out of his wallet. 
LARGE (CONT'D) Look at her face.. That's how, she. was every single day of her life. And one day... I was nine years old and I just really hated, her for that, and I pushed her. 
(BEAT) I mean it was innocent. I was just frustrated 'cause... 
SAM You couldn't make her happy. 
LARGE Yeah. Fuck yeah. And any other time, she would have just yelled at me and sent me to my room, but this time, in that moment, the door of the dishwasher was open. The latch on it was broken and it would just randomly fall open. That fucking latch; it's funny how so much of my life hasbeendetermined by a quarterinchpiece of plastic. So she fellbackover the door and her neck hitthekitchen counter; paralyzing her from the waist down. Sam's eyes are wide in shock. 
SAM Oh my God. 
E 
LARGE Still want to compare fucked up families? 
JESSE But your Mom was in the wheelchair long before you left. 
LARGE Well I was nine. They sent me to therapy and my Father put me on these drugs that were supposed to "curb my anger". And I've been on some form of them ever since. My Mother who was clinically depressed before the accident, sank even lower to the point where she just ignored everyone but our housekeeper, Janice and her daughter, Cynthia. And when I was sixteen my psychiatrist Dad came around to the conclusion that it might not be the healthiest environment for me to be growing up in. So he sent me to boarding school. And I haven't been home since. 
SAM Until now. 
MARK For her funeral. 
LARGE Until now for her funeral. I'm off to a ripping start in this life, huh? Next time through I think I'll lay low out of the gate. He takes a sip of his beer. 
LARGE (CONT ' D) The thing is though, when I think about it, I wasn't really abnormally angry at all. I mean it all happened so quickly; I got prescribed all these drugs for anxiety and depression and anger so I just kind of became what they are. 
SAM It sounds like a punishment. 
LARGE I think it was. So I left them in LA. I'm taking myself off punishment. 
MARK Please don't remind me. 
JESSE All he heard of that whole story was "left drugs in LA". 
MARK Fuck you. 
JESSE Crackhead. A 19 year old girl from the pool comes around the corner 
DRIPPING WET_ 
GIRL Mark? Where's the sauna? Mark and Jesse look at each other. They race towards her tripping drunkenly on towels and pushing each other out of the way. Sam smiles at Large. Her face glowswarm from the fire. 
MARK Jesse cooked his. They both laugh. 
LARGE Why's it brown? 
MARK 'Cause my wife was Tanisha Lubin. 
LARGE Oh. Large laughs at Mark's earnestness. 
LARGE (CONT'D) You kept her little blue skirt on. 
MARK He's a boy. His name's Shantel. 
LARGE It's a girl, she's wearin' a skirt. 
MARK They're shorts. 
LARGE Shorts? 
MARK Yeah, he's a boy, Shantel. They're shorts. 
LARGE Oh. They laugh. Large flips through an album. 
LARGE (CONT'D) You collect "Desert Storm Trading Cards"? 
MARK Fuck yeah, dude. Those are collectors items. Do you have any idea how much those things will be worth some day. 
LARGE Really? 
MARK Hell yeah. That shit's like an investment. I have lots of little investments - all over the place. I'm gonna sel3. 'em all one day and just live off 'em. 
LARGE So like how much is this one worth? 
MARK Which? 
LARGE "Night Vision Goggles." 
MARK I don't know. Mint; maybe two, three. 
LARGE Dollars? 
MARK Yeah. But it's too early. You don't sell'em yet. Don't you know anything about investing. I'm gonna live off that shit. That "Schwarzkopf" card is worth at least five something. And if you have the complete set it's worth like thousands. 
LARGE So do you have the complete set? 
MARK Almost. The corners are bent on my "Friendly Fire" and someone stole my "Wolf Blitzer". 
LARGE Someone stole it? 
MARK One of my Mom's Medieval Times friends, man. Drug addicts. 
LARGE For drugs they sold it? 
MARK Yeah. 
LARGE Wolf Blitzer. 
MARK It doesn't matter if you're a rich house wife looking for your muscle relaxers or some crack head drying cars: people will do anything in this town to get their drug money. Now look, what do you gotta do today? I gotta little going away present for you. But I kinds gotta track it down. So, can you give me a ride? 
LARGE Yeah, sure I just... 
MARK What? 
LARGE Nothing I just... 
MARK Say it... speak. 
LARGE Nothing I just, I told Sam I was gonna hang out with her today... 
MARK She can come, I don't care. 
EXT. SUBURBAN STREETS- DAY 
GREAT MUSIC PLAYS. They drive the motorcycle through the Jersey suburbs; Sate on the back and Mark in the sidecar wearing a lacrosse helmet and ski goggles. LARGE'S POV: A mother and her stroller. A huge group of Black teenagers coming home from school. An old crossing guard. An ambulance. Two powerwalkere. 
OMIT 
INT. HANDI-WORLD - LATER 
LARGE Oh, washers. I never use those. I never knew what they were for, so. I just always threw them away. I never used washers. Silence. 
KARL Oh, well listen, I want to talk to you both about a good opportunity. (like he's memorized it 
LAST NIGHT) For you and your loved ones. We all have dreams. I know I do. I know of an exciting opportunity that people are talking about. Mark returns holding a box with a picture of steak knives on the side. 
MARK Hey. We gotta get going. 
LARGE Yeah, well it was great to see you, man. I'm sure I'll see you around. 
KARL Yeah, well let me get your number. 
LARGE oh, well we gotta run. I'm listed. Just call information. It's been so long since I've been home I don't even remember it. 
SAM Nice meeting you. 
INT. HANDI-WORLD CHECKOUT -- CONTINUOUS 
MARK Why is it always the losers who get into the pyramid schemes? Why isn't it ever some charming hot girl nagging you incessantly to buy shit? 
LARGE Oh, is that what it is? 
MARK Detergent or some shit. The thing I don't understand is, if it worked, why would he be working here. The guy's a freak; he pops Darvocet like it's Ritalin. 
LARGE Why are you buying knives? I don't need knives. They arrive at the counter. A young Black woman with enormous gold earrings and long fingernails stands at the register. 
MARK I'd like to return these. 
WOMAN You got a receipt. 
MARK Actually, no. It was a gift. She clicks her tongue. She begins filling out a form. 
WOMAN Why are you returning these? 
MARK They're not sharp enough. 
WOMAN They're not sharp enough? 
MARK No. Not for what we need them for. They couldn't cut cans. 
WOMAN You bought them to cut cans? 
MARK No, but in the commercial they say that if I wanted to cut cans I could. But with these knives I can't. 
WOMAN Well it comes with a sharpener. Did you try it? 
MARK Yeah, they're just... I don't want them; not sharp enough. She rings it into the register and counts out bills to Mark. 
WOMAN Thirty-nine, fifty-three. I hope we came in handy at Handi-World. Please come again. They exit the store and enter the mall. 
EXT. MALL - DAY 
They walk past stacks of lumber. 
MARK A major loop-hole in the Handi- World return policy permits returns without receipts on items below forty dollars. 
LARGE So how often do you go? 
MARK I hit every employee once, then wait for them to. hire. new ones. Luckily, no one works at Handi- World for very long. Except Karl Benson. 
LARGE You know, Mark, it's my last day in town. I have money. I can give you some. 
MARK I don't need your money, I'm making my own right now. 
LARGE Or fuck, take Jesse's - the guys a millionaire. 
Mark stops and looks at Large in the eyes. 
MARK i don't take anybody's money, Andrew. I make my own. Favors are bad news. And the only thing worse than a favor, is a favor involving money. 
EXT. RESCUE SQUAD -- LATER 
The motorcycle pulls up behind two ambulances being cleaned with hoses. Large sees Cynthia changing the sheets on a stretcher. They climb off. 
MARK This will only take a second. 
(TO CYNTHIA) Is Aaron here? 
FROM SUBTITLES. They squeeze down a long dark corridor filled with graffiti. They come upon a young teen staring through a peep hole in the wall. Mark taps him on the shoulder. He turns his head and nods in recognition. When he pulls away from the peep hole, the LIGHT PROJECTS THE 
IMAGE OF THE MOTEL ROOM ON HIS FACE . 
(Yes, that really happens.) As he looks at Mark, Sam and Large, his forehead is filled with the image of a BUSINESS MAN brushing his teeth. Mark leans into his ear. 
MARK 
(SUBTITLED) Where's Diego? 
TEEN 
(SUBTITLED) Down the hall. There's a hooker in room 112.. It's crazy down there. I figured I'd just chill with this. SLOW MOTION: Mark gestures for Large and Sam to follow him down the hall. The hall is strewn with young men staring into peep holes. As Mark, Sam and Large pass them, the Peeping Tom's each turn to see who it is. As they turn, each one has the image of what they're watching projected on their face. We hear the ECHOES of the SOUNDS FROM the ROOMS. -- An old couple slow dancing projected on another teen. REGULAR MOTION: They arrive at the end of the hall where a group of six young guys are glued to the image being projected onto the wall opposite the peep hole. An old camera lens has been ducked taped to the peep hole causing the image to appear in perfect focus. The projection shows a very hot, YOUNG HOOKER getting taken from behind by an OLDER GREASEBALL. Her face is no more than three feet from the peep hole. The HOOKER'S MUFFLED MOANING can be heard from the other side of the wall. Everyone's eyes are glued to the wall. Large notices one kid has duct tape over his mouth, while another is sweating profusely. Sam's jaw is dropped open. 
GRBASESALL (0.5.) I'm fucking you! I'm fucking you. Large notices another kid lip-synching along with the Greaseball. Mark spots DIEGO, a Hispanic guy, 32, wearing a bell-hop uniform and gestures him closer. 
MARK 
(SUBTITLED) T'sup dog? She's fuckin' hot. 
DIEGO 
(SUBTITLED) This is the most exciting day of my life. We've never had anything close to this. 
MARK I've got that Nitrous tank for you, so can I get that info? 
DIEGO You're gonna have to wait a couple. The HOOKER MOANS. 
GREASEBALL (O.S.) Who's fuckin' you? Hub? Who's fuckin' you? The Lip-Synching Kid mouths, "You are." 
MARK Dude we're kind of in a rush. 
DIEGO You can wait, he's about to cunt. 
GREASEBALL I'm gonna fucking cum! Diegogestures, "Told you." 
HOOKER Cum on my back! The group responds in silent shock. Jaws drop, Diego grabs his hair with his fists. Just as they are about to climax, we 
CUT TO: 
INT. OUTER ROOM --- DAY 
Mark, Diego, Large, Sam and others rush out into the outer room.They speak in quiet whispers. 
DIEGO 
HOLY SHIT3 
MARK Wow. 
DIEGO That shit was hot! I got to go drop some knowledge on that ho. 
SAM How do you know she's a hooker? 
DIEGO of course she's a fucking hooker. Girls that look like her do not fuck guys that look like him unless it's for money, coke or fame. 
SAM Julia Roberts married Lyle Lovett. 
DIEGO Who the fuck are you? 
MARX Oh, this is Sam and Large. 
DIEGO No offense. 
(TO MARK) Why are you bringing these people here? 
MARK He's the guy who needs that thing. Look I brought you the tank, so can you just tell us where to go now? 
DIEGO Tank come with balloons? 
MARX Am I a fucking birthday clown, Diego? No I don't have balloons. Suck it off the tap. And I need it back when you're done; the guy's holding my thirty-nine bucks. 
DIEGO All right. Hold-up. Who here just saw some titties?! They all stare. 
DIEGO (CONT'D) Raise your hand if you just saw some titties?! They all raise their hands. (Including Sam.) 
DIEGO (CONT'D) Thank you. So everybody needs to calm the fuck down. 
LARGE Safe. 
(BEAT) When I'm with you, I feel so safe... like I'm Rome. A WIDE SHOT of the bathroom as Sam and Large embrace in the middle of the empty tub and the faucet continuee to DRIP. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. LARGE'S BEDROOM -- LATER 
Large's STEREO PLAYS: ("I Just Don't Think I'll Ever Get Over You" by Colin Ray) Large and Sam lie naked in each other's arms. She's asleep. He lies wide awake resting his cheek on top of here. A SERIES OF DISSOLVES: of Large as he lies awake in different positions staring at the ceiling; processing. S am turns to him. He gets up out of bed and puts his clothes on. 
TNT. MASTER BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS Large stands at the end of the bed staring at Gideon lying propped up with a book on his cheat, asleep. The EVENING NEWS is on the TV. 
LARGE Dad? He sits up startled. 
GIDEON Oh, hey, hey c'mon in. He finds his glasses on his chest and lifts the remote to turn off the TV. 
LARGE Sorry to wake you. 
GIDEON No, no, it's uh... I was just reading. 
LARGE I've been on a pretty crazy little journey these last couple of days. 
GIDEON You've been avoiding me. 
LARGE No, I just... maybe I have been. 
GIDEON I'm sure you can find plenty of things in your life to be angry about, but what I don't understand is why you're so angry at me. All I ever wanted was for everybody to be happy again, Andrew. That's all I ever wanted. 
LARGE But when were we ever all happy, Dad? I mean you always say that, but when was that? When was this time that you have in your mind that you wish we could all get back to? 'Cause I don't have it in my memory. Maybe if I did I could help steer us back there. But we should... 
(BEAT) You know... you and I need to work on being okay if that's not in the cards for us. 
GIDEON Well we might have a shot at it if you could just forgive yourself for what you did. 
LARGE What I did? What I did?! You know what, Dad? I'm gonna forgive myself for what I did right now: I was a little boy and somebody made a shitty latch. That's what I think now. And I'm not gonna... I mean I'm not gonna take all those drugs anymore. Because they've left me completely numb. I have felt so fucking numb to everything I have experienced in my life. And for that; I'm here to forgive you. Gideon site up against the headboard. 
LARGE (CONT'D) You've always said you wanted us to have whatever it is we wanted. Well maybe what Mom wanted more than anything, was for it to all be over. And for me, what I really want more than anything, is for it to be okay with you for me to feel something again; even if it's pain. 
GIDEON Going against your doctor's recommendation; that's a pretty weighty experiment to take on don't you think? 
LARGE (with a chuckle) This is my life, Dad. This is it. I've spent twenty-six years waiting for something else to start. So no, I don't think it's too much to take on. Because it's everything there is. 
(BEAT) I see now it's all there is. 
GIDEON Perhaps the great tragedy of my life, will be that you both deserved more than I knew how to give? 
LARGE We deserved nothing more than you. And you deserved nothing more than us. Large puts his hand on the center of his father's bare chest. 
LARGE (CONT'D) You and I are gonna be okay. You know that, right? 
(BEAT) 
(MORE) 
We may not be as happy as you always hoped we'd be. But for the first time let's allow ourselves to be whatever it is that we are... and that'll be better. OK? I think that'll be better. 
DISSOLVE TO, 
INT. NEWARK AIRPORT STAIRCASE -- MORNING 
Large sits next to Sam on a staircase between two escalators. 
SAM What are you doing? 
LARGE I don't want to hurt you. 
SAM No. Why? How can you... how could you... What's going on? What happened? We can figure out the long distance thing. Don't... this is a good thing, Large. Don't... you're gonna be... please don't do this. Shestarts crying. 
LARGE Sam. 
SAM 
(THROUGH TEARS) You don't realize. This is good. This doesn't happen often in your life. We can figure this stuff out. I wanna help you. We need each other; I haven't even lied in two days. 
LARGE Is that true? 
SAM No.

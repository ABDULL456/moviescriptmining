STAR WARS 
EPISODE VII 
THE FORCE AWAKENS 
Luke Skywalker has vanished. In his absence, the sinister FIRST ORDER has risen from the ashes of the Empire and will not rest until Skywalker, the last Jedi, has been destroyed. With the support of the REPUBLIC, General Leia Organa leads a brave RESISTANCE. She is desperate to find her brother Luke and gain his help in restoring peace and justice to the galaxy. 
Leia has sent her most daring pilot on a secret mission to Jakku, where an old ally has discovered a clue to Luke's whereabouts.... 
PAN across the star field to a bright moon. A RUMBLING is FELT. A VAST STAR DESTROYER -- unlike any we have seen -- HURTLES PAST US, of seemingly endless length, eclipsing the moon. After a long beat, FOUR TRANSPORT SHIPS fly from a hangar. We HOLD ON THEM NOW, as they fly off toward a distant planet. Jakku. MUSIC BUILDS AND WE... 
CUT TO BLACK. 
A GROWING ROAR of MEAN ENGINES -- gnarled RADIO CALLS, the SHUDDERING of a ship's hull. Then FLASHES OF LIGHT: for an instant we see a STORMTROOPER -- then BLACKNESS. Then ANOTHER STORMTROOPER, then it's gone. 
The FLICKERING CONTINUES until the LIGHTS ARE CONSTANT. We 
ARE IN: 
INT. TROOP TRANSPORT VEHICLE - NIGHT 
TWENTY STORMTROOPERS. Holding on at attention, moving to the ship's rhythm, in the tense moments before a raid. A FILTERED COMMAND and they LOCK AND LOAD their heavy blaster rifles. The BRUTAL NOISE is replaced by SUDDEN, SHOCKING 
QUIET: 
EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT 
WIDE SHOT of a small, peaceful village. Distant sounds of native animals. A single wind chime. Suddenly a DROID RISES INTO FRAME, CLOSE: ROUND and SKITTERY, orange and white, this is BB-8. Focuses on something past camera. He BEEPS -- FAST, MORSE CODE-LIKE SOUNDS, clearly worried. Moves EVEN CLOSER TO CAMERA -- is MORE worried -- BEEPS more -- then TURNS AND 
ROLLS OFF FAST -- 
INT. LARGE HUT - NIGHT 
CLOSE ON A HAND: a small LEATHER SACK is placed in the palm. The hand closes. Another OLDER HAND covers it. In a primitive HUT, an old explorer, LOR SAN TEKKA, (rugged, kind) has handed the mysterious sack to POE DAMERON (32, in a pilot's jacket). Poe has charisma, a natural spark: 
LOR SAN TEKKA This will begin to make things right. I've traveled too far, and seen too much, to ignore the despair in the galaxy. Without the Jedi, there can be no balance in the Force. 
POE Well, because of you now we have a chance. The General's been after this for a long time. 
LOR SAN TEKKA "The General." To me, she's royalty. Well, she certainly is that. 
POE BB-8 ENTERS FRANTIC, BEEPS. Concerned, Poe turns to Lor San Tekka. 
POE (CONT'D) We've got company. 
EXT. LARGE HUT - NIGHT 
The men exit fast. Poe moves TO CAMERA, raises QUADNOCULARS. POE'S POV: LIGHTS on the horizon -- approaching ENEMY SHIPS. POE lowers the quadnocs -- PUSH IN ON HIS UNNERVED EYES. A 
GROWING, FRIGHTENING THUNDER. 
POE You have to hide. 
LOR SAN TEKKA You have to leave. Go! Poe turns to him. Conflicted. Finally nods, hurries off. BB-8 follows. 
EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT 
TRACK FAST with Poe as he and BB-8 hurry through the village, various ARMED VILLAGERS taking position, prepared to defend. 
EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT 
A ROAR of WIND and DUST: the TRANSPORTS LAND. Stormtroopers come out FIRING BLASTERS -- the VILLAGERS FIRE BACK -- many are HIT! 
EXT. RISE ADJACENT TO VILLAGE - NIGHT 
Poe runs to an X-WING fighter, parked at a distance from the village, hidden behind a ROCK OUTCROPPING. 
POE Come on, BB-8! Hurry! Poe sends BB-8 into the droid socket / co-pilot seat -- he moves to the cockpit -- the CONTROLS COME TO LIFE. As the CANOPY CLOSES, Poe shoots a quick look back: the ENEMY ARRIVES 
IN THE DISTANCE. Poe urgently works the controls -- BB-8 BEEPS. The X-WING LANDING LIGHTS COME ON, ENGINES WHINE TO LIFE! But just then: Poe's ship is suddenly HIT BY BLASTERFIRE! Poe turns to look: two STORMTROOPERS CHARGE HIS WAY, FIRING! 
POE (CONT'D) I see 'em! BB-8 BEEPS nervously as Poe GRABS HIS CONTROLS and FIRES AT THEM, using the X-wing's drop-down antipersonnel blaster! The two Troopers are BLOWN AWAY in the large BLAST HITS! Poe tries to start the ship now, but the ENGINES SPUTTER. Concerned, he opens his canopy, jumps down, moves to the back of his ship: BAD DAMAGE ON THE REAR ENGINE PANEL. They're in trouble. 
EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
STORMTROOPER #2 Nothing here. Go ahead! Three other Stormtroopers FIRE LASER CANNONS at the X-wing -- destroying the ship in a LARGE EXPLOSION. 
EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT 
BB-8 rolls across the sand, looks back: the X-wing FIREBALL. BB-8, afraid, continues on his own in a mysterious, dark desert. We see a FORM -- an animal, its RED EYES LIFTING from the sand, watching the rolling droid, who just keeps going. In a WIDE SHOT, we HEAR HIM BEEPING to himself, lonely and frightened. 
EXT. SPACE - NIGHT 
With the SANDY PLANET OF JAKKU as backdrop, Troop Transports and Kylo Ren's Shuttle approach a massive STAR DESTROYER. 
INT. STAR DESTROYER HANGAR - NIGHT 
Poe, shackled, is ushered from the transport through the hangar. He is awed by the imposing space. 
POE All right. All right! Our Stormtrooper passes, moves fast: 
INT. TROOP TRANSPORT VEHICLE - NIGHT 
Our Stormtrooper enters the dark, vehicle. He removes his helmet. His head comes up and we PUSH IN ON HIS FACE FOR THE FIRST TIME. This is FN-2187. He is 23, likable. But in this moment, terrified, desperate. After a beat, behind him, CAPTAIN PHASMA enters. FN-2187 knows he's in trouble. 
CAPTAIN PHASMA FN-2187. Submit your blaster for inspection. 
FN-2187 Yes, Captain. 
CAPTAIN PHASMA And who gave you permission to remove that helmet? 
FN-2187 I'm sorry, Captain. 
CAPTAIN PHASMA Report to my division at once. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Phasma heads off. Shattered, FN-2187 replaces his helmet. 
CUT TO: 
INT. JUNKED VESSEL CORRIDOR - DAY 
A metal sheet is pulled open to reveal the wrapped up face of A SCAVENGER, perhaps alien, in GOGGLES, FACE MASK and GLOVES. Backpack with a STAFF strapped to it. Uses TOOLS to remove various MECHANISMS from inside the wall. We are in an upside-down, canted CORRIDOR. The Scavenger finds a valuable piece, drops it in a SATCHEL. Swings the bag back and begins CLIMBING DOWN on a cable, between treacherous WALLS OF MACHINERY, headed to: 
INT. JUNKED VESSEL - LARGER SPACE - LATER 
Alone and tiny in this massive, sideways wreck, the Scavenger descends, climbing down a two-hundred foot-long cable. LANDS HARD onto rusty metal. 
INT. JUNKED VESSEL - ENGINES - DAY 
The Scavenger carries the satchel and another large, found piece, over enormous pipes in the vast space, heads through the dust toward a distant SLIT OF SUNLIGHT. 
EXT. JUNKED VESSEL ENGINE - DAY 
The Scavenger arrives from the darkness and pulls off goggles and gear, revealing the grimy face of a beautiful, young WOMAN. This is REY, 19. She opens her canteen, shakes out the two final drops into her mouth. HITS THE SIDE of the canteen again and again for whatever she can get. CUT WIDE: Rey is rendered minuscule, standing at the bottom of an EPIC 
ENGINE OF A DECAYING, CRASHED STAR DESTROYER -- DISTANT SOUND of her canteen-hitting. She sets her things on a piece of sheet metal and sits next to it, sliding down the sand dune. She RIDES DOWN THE MOUNTAIN OF SAND. WE HOLD FOR A LONG TIME, looking down, as she recedes from us, toward the distant SALT FLATS below. Random SCATTERED DEBRIS. Her SPEEDER, tiny from here. Rey moves to her junker SPEEDER, jumps on, fires the sputtery engine and DRIVES OFF. 
EXT. DESERT - SPACESHIP GRAVEYARD - DAY 
Rey races along the desert floor: a GRAVEYARD OF CRASHED 
SPACESHIPS. 
EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - DAY 
Rey's speeder PASSES us, heading for a dusty, desert town. Refueling, small trade, scavengers. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: CRASH! Rey's sack carrying her heavy FOUND OBJECTS hits the sand. Working like a tough seaman, Rey hauls the sack from her speeder toward the town. 
EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - CLEANING TABLE - DAY 
TIGHT ON REY'S HANDS as she SCRUBS CLEAN her day's salvage. Rey glances up: she looks at an old woman, also cleaning some salvage. Rey watches her, gets lost in the simple moment. A small, passing alien UNDERLING barks something to her in another language. She returns to work. 
INT. NIIMA TRADING STRUCTURE - DAY 
Rey looks up to a SERVICE WINDOW: two feet above her, behind a protective screen, is her boss, UNKAR PLUTT (50, blobfish, unclean). He examines her pieces. Then he offers: 
UNKAR What you've brought me today is worth... Hmmm... One quarter portion. Though disappointed, Rey barely shows it. She nods thanks. Unkar pushes through his transfer drawer a SEALED PACKET: DRIED GREEN MEAT in one section, BEIGE POWDER in another. She takes it. She swallows her resentment and heads off. 
EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - DAY 
The IMMENSE SETTING SUN against the FLAT TERRAIN. Rey's SPEEDER races, almost insignificant, across frame. 
INT. NIIMA TRADING STRUCTURE - DAY 
Rey stands with BB-8 in front of Unkar Plutt, at his window. He reviews her goods. He glances quickly at BB-8. 
UNKAR These five pieces are worth... Let me see here... One half portion. 
REY 
(OBJECTS) Last week they were a half portion each. She hates him. He leans forward. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
UNKAR What about the droid? 
REY What about him? 
UNKAR I'll pay for him. BB-8 doesn't like this at all. Rey is awkward, but curious. 
UNKAR (CONT'D) Sixty portions. CLOSE ON HER. Stunned. Literally hungry for this amount of food, her stomach practically rumbles. BB-8 sees her interest and BEEPS furiously, not liking this conversation at all. She looks at Unkar. Looks down at BB-8. Considers it all. Finally, she hears herself say: 
REY Actually... the droid's not for sale. 
(TO BB-8) Come on. Unkar furious. Rey, then BB-8, head out. Recovering, Unkar watches her go with dark eyes. He picks up a communicator: 
UNKAR Follow the girl and get that droid. He SLAMS the service window door SHUT. 
INT. STAR DESTROYER HOLDING CELL - DAY 
The cell door WHOOSHES OPEN -- a STORMTROOPER enters. Poe remains shackled, worse for wear. A TROOPER GUARD here. 
STORMTROOPER Ren wants the prisoner. TIGHT ON POE, in pain, drained, as the Guard unshackles him. 
INT. STAR DESTROYER CORRIDOR - DAY 
An exhausted, handcuffed Poe is walked down the corridor by the Stormtrooper, who holds a blaster at Poe's body. 
STORMTROOPER Turn here. Poe turns into a narrow passageway -- 
INT. STAR DESTROYER NARROW PASSAGEWAY - DAY 
Heading down the narrow hall the Stormtrooper stops Poe. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
STORMTROOPER Listen carefully: you do exactly as I say, I can get you out of here. 
POE 
(COMING TO) If -- what--? The Stormtrooper pulls off his helmet: IT IS FN-2187. 
FN-2187 This is a rescue, I'm helping you escape. Can you fly a TIE fighter? 
POE You with the Resistance--?! 
FN-2187 What? 
(THAT'S CRAZY) No no no! I'm breaking you out. Can you fly a TIE fighter? 
POE I can fly anything. Why, why are you helping me? 
FN-2187 Because it's the right thing to do. 
POE (it hits him) You need a pilot. 
FN-2187 I need a pilot. And Poe, seeing this is for real, smiles a hero's smile. 
POE We're gonna do this. 
FN-2187 (unsure but hopeful) ... Yeah? 
INT. STAR DESTROYER HANGAR - DAY 
WIDE SHOT ESTABLISHING the hangar. Find FN-2187, again masked, walking with Poe. By all appearances he's escorting a prisoner. A group of OFFICERS passes in the opposite direction. 
FN-2187 Okay, stay calm, stay calm. 
POE I am calm. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
FN-2187 
FN-2187! Poe reacts, this tells him volumes about FN-2187's history. 
POE FN-whaa? 
FN-2187 That's the only name they ever gave me! 
POE Well I ain't using it! FN, huh? Finn. I'm gonna call you Finn! That all right? Even in the madness, Finn can't suppress his smile. 
FINN "Finn." Yeah, "Finn", I like that! I like that! 
POE I'm Poe. Poe Dameron. 
FINN Good to meet you, Poe! 
POE Good to meet you too, Finn! 
INT. STAR DESTROYER MAIN BRIDGE - DAY 
General Hux looks over the shoulder of LIEUTENANT MITAKA, at a console. 
LIEUTENANT MITAKA Sir, they've taken out our turbolasers-- 
GENERAL HUX Use the ventral cannons. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
LIEUTENANT MITAKA Yes, sir. Bringing them online -- 
KYLO REN (O.S.) General Hux. Is it the Resistance pilot? Hux turns: Kylo Ren enters fast, looms large, angry. 
GENERAL HUX Yes, and he had help. 
(VEXED) From one of our own. PUSH IN ON REN as Hux says: 
GENERAL HUX (CONT'D) We're checking the registers now to identify which Stormtrooper it was. 
KYLO REN ... The one from the village. FN- 
Hux is unnerved that Ren knows -- he chalks it up to Ren's Force ability. Kylo Ren heads off. 
LIEUTENANT MITAKA Sir. Ventral cannons hot. 
GENERAL HUX Fire. 
EXT. STAR DESTROYER - DAY 
Massive WARHEAD LAUNCHERS SPIN and FIRE BLASTS toward the TIE fighter, which flies EVASIVE MANEUVERS -- most blasts hit the DEBRIS from the TURBOLASER DESTRUCTION. The TIE fighter then PULLS A BIG TURN, BACK TOWARD JAKKU, 
THE SANDY PLANET WHERE POE LEFT BB-8. 
INT. TIE FIGHTER - DAY 
POE One's coming towards you. My right, your left. Do you see it? 
FINN Hold on! I see it! 
POE Nice shot. Finn looks up suddenly in alarm -- 
FINN Where are you going? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
POE We're going back to Jakku. That's where. 
FINN No no no! We can't go back to Jakku! We need to get outta this system! NEAR-MISS LASER BLASTS as Poe pilots aggressively. 
POE I got to get to my droid before the First Order does! 
FINN What - a droid?! 
POE That's right. He's a BB unit! Orange and white: one of a kind. 
FINN I don't care what color he is! No droid can be that important! 
POE This one is, pal. 
FINN We need to get as far away from the First Order as we can! We go back to Jakku, we die! 
POE That droid's got a map that leads straight to Luke Skywalker! 
REY (To BB-8) Who? Him? Finn is confused. Rey stands, staring at Finn, defiant. Finn can feel trouble coming -- and Rey begins CHARGING AT HIM, quarterstaff in hand. Realizing he's the target, Finn begins to RUN -- away from her, through the tent marketplace. Rey goes after him -- he turns a corner -- then another -- then BAM! She's got ahead of him and SLAMS HIM TO THE GROUND WITH HER STAFF! Finn is on his back, out of breath and freaked out. She holds the staff on him threateningly: 
REY What's your hurry, thief? 
FINN What--?! Thief? BB-8 ROLLS UP FAST, MOVES TO FINN -- a WELDING ARM TELESCOPES 
FROM HIS BODY AND SHOCKS FINN! 
FINN (CONT'D) OW! HEY! What?! 
REY The jacket! This droid says you stole it! 
FINN I've had a pretty messed up day, alright?! So I'd appreciate it you stop accusing me -- OW!!! (BB-8 has ZAPPED him 
AGAIN) 
STOP IT! 
REY Where'd you get it? It belongs to his master. Finn looks at her -- then the agitated droid, Finn's mind racing. He puts it all together. Frustrated, but sighs heavily, needing to respond somehow. So he makes a hard decision: to tell the truth. 
FINN It belonged to Poe Dameron. That was his name, right? Rey and BB-8 react, surprised and wanting more. 
FINN (CONT'D) He was captured... by the First Order! I helped him escape but our ship crashed. 
(RELIVING IT) Poe didn't make it. (sees BB-8 is sad, 
ROLLS OFF) Look, I tried to help him. I'm sorry... BB-8 heads off to the side, depressed. Rey watches BB-8, then considers Finn again. Says, a bit impressed: 
REY So you're with the Resistance? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Finn's mind races again. He makes an easy decision: to lie. 
FINN Obviously. Yes. I am. I'm with the Resistance, yeah. 
(WHISPERS) I'm with the Resistance. Rey lowers her staff, Finn stands. Rey studies him: 
REY I've never met a Resistance fighter before. 
FINN Well, this is what we look like. Some of us. Others look different. 
REY BB-8 says he's on a secret mission, he has to get back to your base. 
FINN Apparently he's carrying a map that leads to Luke Skywalker, and everyone's after it. She turns to him, concerned, curious. And asks: 
REY Luke Skywalker? I thought he was a myth. Just then BB-8 BEEPS MADLY at something he sees. 
REY (CONT'D) What is it? Rey moves to him, peeks around a tent corner. Now Finn moves to see: at a distance, TWO STORMTROOPERS TALKING TO UNKAR'S THUGS -- who POINT THEIR WAY! Finn urgently grabs her hand and heads for the tents: 
REY (CONT'D) (re: her hand) What are you doing?! 
FINN Come on! Suddenly LASER BLASTS RIP PAST THEM, HIT THE CLEANING UNIT, SPEWING STEAM! Rey SCREAMS -- MORE BLASTS as they run! 
EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - DAY 
Finn and Rey holding hands, the three race, ZIGZAGGING through a maze of tents: 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
FINN Come on, BB-8! 
REY Let go of me! 
FINN No, we gotta move! 
REY (pulls her hand back) I know how to run without you holding my hand! BB-8 stay close! This way! Now Finn and BB-8 follow Rey -- ANOTHER BLAST just missing them! They disappear through a tent. TRACK FAST WITH STORMTROOPERS, through the tent maze. They come out of a tent, HAVING MOMENTARILY LOST THEIR TARGET. 
STORMTROOPER Call in the air strike! REY, FINN AND BB-8 duck into another tent: 
INT. NIIMA OUTPOST - TENT - DAY 
Rey, Finn and BB-8 move through RUSTY WARES and take cover. Quiet, urgent: 
REY They're shooting at both of us! 
FINN Yeah, they saw you with me! You're marked! 
REY Well, thanks for that! 
FINN I'm not the one who chased you down with a stick! Does anyone have blasters around here?! 
REY 
UNKAR 
HEY!!!! THAT'S MIIIIIIINE!!! The Falcon BLASTS AWAY, two TIE FIGHTERS chase it, fast! 
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - DAY 
Rey pilots, headed for the sky! Finn SWINGS into frame, trying to work the GUNS. 
FINN Whoa! Hey! Oh! Stay low! Stay low! 
REY 
WHAT? 
FINN Stay low! It confuses their tracking! For a crazy instant Rey LETS GO OF THE YOKE, stretches to the co-pilot controls -- THE FALCON CANTS! 
REY BB-8, hold on! Rey finally REACHES the switches, returns to the yoke, stabilizing the ship, afraid of this next move. 
REY 
I'M GOING LOW!!! 
EXT. DESERT - DAY 
BEHIND THE FALCON as it DRAMATICALLY BANKS AT AN UPWARD ARC, UPSIDE-DOWN, then SWOOPS PERILOUSLY LOW across the sand. Two TIE FIGHTERS SCREAM past us! 
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - DAY 
In the cylindrical corridor, BB-8 ROLLS TO THE CEILING! Rey looks back for a flash as the TIE Fighters pass -- They are ROCKED BY A BLAST! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
REY What are you doing back there? Are you ever gonna fire back?! 
Finn flicks switches -- The GUN TARGETING LIGHTS UP: 
FINN I'm working on it! Are the shields up? Rey strains, reaching for something in the co-pilot seat. 
REY Not so easy without a co-pilot! Finn struggles with the gun controls and SWEEPING CHAIR: 
FINN Try sitting in this thing! Finn finally FIRES BACK at the two TIE FIGHTERS! 
EXT. DESERT - DAY 
Finn's shots MISS. The TIE FIGHTERS ARC BACK IN PURSUIT and SCREAM PAST US toward the Falcon! Both TIES FIRING! 
INT. TIE FIGHTER COCKPIT - DAY 
The BLACK-SUITED PILOT FIRES at the Falcon. 
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNNER POSITION - DAY 
The Falcon is ROCKED by another BLAST! 
FINN We need cover, quick! 
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY 
Rey HITS SWITCHES, pilots the best she can: 
REY We're about to get some! 
(TO HERSELF) I hope. 
EXT. DESERT - DAY 
The Falcon speeds through a ROCK FORMATION, GRAZING THE ROCK, TAKING OUT A CHUNK -- the two TIE Fighters in pursuit, FIRING! The Falcon BANKS SO HARD, the edge of the ship RIPS A LINE IN THE SAND as it turns, REVEALING THE SHIP GRAVEYARD AHEAD. 
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - DAY 
BB-8 EXTENDS MAGNETIC CABLES to brace himself in a corridor. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Finn continues to fire at the TIE fighters, narrowly missing them. 
FINN Damn it! Rey maneuvers the ship deeper into the graveyard. 
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNNER POSITION - DAY 
Finn SWOOPS into frame, FIRES -- 
FINN Come on... come on... -- HITS AND SHATTERS the TIE FIGHTER! 
INT. STAR DESTROYER BRIDGE - DAY 
Lieutenant Mitaka moves to Ren, who looks out across the star field. Mitaka swallows, uneasy with his task. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
LIEUTENANT MITAKA Sir. We were unable to acquire the droid on Jakku. Ren turns to look at him, he says nothing. 
LIEUTENANT MITAKA (CONT'D) It escaped capture aboard a stolen Corellian YT model freighter. 
KYLO REN The droid... stole a freighter? 
LIEUTENANT MITAKA Not exactly, sir. It had help. Ren says nothing. Which says everything. Mitaka sweats. 
LIEUTENANT MITAKA (CONT'D) We have no confirmation, but we believe FN-2187 may have been helped in the escape-- Ren IGNITES HIS LIGHTSABER, TURNS AND SLASHES AT THE CONSOLE BEHIND HIM! HOLD ON Mitaka, who reacts, looks away -- winces. The horrible SOUNDS of Ren's rage continues. Finally Mitaka looks up. The metallic wall behind Ren is RIPPED with glowing scars. 
KYLO REN Anything else? Mitaka hates to say the following, but: 
LIEUTENANT MITAKA The two were accompanied by a girl. Ren reaches out -- Mitaka is suddenly, violently PULLED TOWARD REN, into his black glove: 
KYLO REN What girl? 
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - LOUNGE AREA - DAY 
Rey's head POPS up from under the grating, surrounded by STEAM. An EMERGENCY ALARM BLARES. 
REY It's the motivator! Grab me a Harris wrench -- check in there! As he checks a storage box, she disappears down below, overwhelmed by the technical issues -- 
FINN How bad is it?! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
REY If we wanna live, not good! BB-8 watches as Finn searches A SELECTION OF TOOLS: 
FINN They're hunting for us now, we gotta get outta this system! Rey re-emerges, Finn hands her the wrench. 
REY BB-8 said the location of the Resistance Base is "need to know" -- if I'm taking you there, I need to know! 
FINN (Throws a tool) This? She catches it and goes under again, leaving Finn and BB-8 alone. He contemplates telling her the truth. This is his moment. But instead he knees to BB-8, says quietly, urgently: 
FINN (CONT'D) You gotta tell us where the base is. 
(BB-8 BEEPS) I don't speak that. Alright, between us, I'm not with the Resistance, okay? (BB-8 backs up) -- I'm just trying to get away from the First Order -- but you tell us where your base is, I'll get there first -- deal?! (BB-8 COCKS his head) Droid, please. Rey pops up again: 
REY Pilex driver, hurry! Finn moves for the tool. 
REY (CONT'D) So where's your base? 
FINN (searching, to BB-8) Go on BB-8, tell her. 
(QUIETLY) Please! She and Finn look to BB-8 -- who considers the whole situation, then BEEPS. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
REY The Ileenium system? Finn hands her the tool, surprised but thrilled -- Rey disappears below again. 
FINN Yeah, the Ileenium system, that's the one -- get us there as fast as you can. A smiling Finn gives BB-8 a THUMBS UP. BB-8 quickly extends his WELDING TORCH and TURNS IT UPWARD, then retracts it. 
REY I'll drop you two at Ponemah Terminal. I need the bonding tape, hurry! 
FINN (searching for tape) What about you? 
REY I gotta get back to Jakku! 
FINN (loses his mind) BACK TO JAK--?! Why does everyone always wanna go back to Jakku?! ! 
REY No, that one! No. No. The one I'm pointing to! No. NO. NO. If we don't patch it up, the propulsion tank will overflow and flood the ship with poisonous gas! Bb-8 has moved to Finn -- TIPS HIS HEAD, shows him the tool. He throws her the tape, she disappears below: 
FINN This? 
REY Yes! 
FINN Hey. Rey. You're a pilot -- you can fly anywhere! Why go back?! You got a family? You got a boyfriend? Cute boyfriend? The STEAM and ALARM STOP as Rey pops up, annoyed: 
REY None of your business, THAT'S WHY! But then: ALL THE SHIP POWER GOES OUT. BB-8 is nervous. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
HAN (CONT'D) Where'd you get this ship? 
REY Niima Outpost. 
HAN Jakku?! That junkyard? 
FINN Thank you! Junkyard! 
HAN 
(TO CHEWIE) Told ya we should've double-checked the Western Reaches! 
(TO REY) Who had it, Ducain? 
REY I stole it from Unkar Plutt. He stole it from the Irving Boys, who stole it from Ducain. 
HAN Who stole it from me! Well, you tell him Han Solo just stole back the Millennium Falcon for good. Han walks away, takes in the ship: it's his again. Doesn't see that Rey is awed. His back to all of them, he smiles. Chewie responds as Han heads toward the cockpit. 
REY This is the Millennium Falcon? You're Han Solo? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
HAN I used to be. 
FINN Han Solo? The Rebellion General? 
REY No, the smuggler! 
FINN 
(TO CHEWIE) Wasn't he a war hero?! Chewie replies: "Yeah, I guess, kinda..." Rey calls out: 
REY This is the ship that made the Kessel Run in fourteen parsecs...! 
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - SAME 
Han enters the cockpit. 
HAN Twelve! Fourteen. A moment of private joy. Then he sees something that ANNOYS 
HIM: 
HAN (CONT'D) Hey! Some moof-milker put a compressor on the ignition line! Han moves to the corridor. 
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - LOUNGE AREA - DAY 
REY Unkar Plutt did. I thought it was a mistake too, puts too much stress on 
THE HYPERDRIVE-- 
HAN 
(OVERLAPPING HER) -- Stress on the hyperdrive-- (who is she? Then:) Chewie, throw 'em in a pod, we'll drop them at the nearest inhabited planet. 
REY Wait! No -- we need your help! 
HAN My help? 
REY This droid has to get to the Resistance base as soon as possible! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
FINN He's carrying a map to Luke Skywalker. Yup: Han stops in his tracks. 
FINN (CONT'D) You are the Han Solo that fought with the Rebellion. You knew him. The mention of Luke has really hit Han. He turns to Finn. 
HAN Yeah, I knew him. I knew Luke. Suddenly: a distant, METALLIC KA-CHUNK! 
HAN (CONT'D) Don't tell me a Rathtar's gotten 
LOOSE-- Han hurries out -- they all follow, (Chewie, Rey, Finn, then BB-8), Finn with WILD CONCERN: 
FINN Wait -- a what?! Did you just say Rathtars? Hey! 
INT. CARGO SHIP - HANGAR - DAY 
The Falcon is parked in this giant freighter's hangar. Han moves to a CONTROL PANEL, they all follow him. 
FINN You're not hauling Rathtars on this freighter, are you? 
HAN I'm hauling Rathtars. On the CONTROL PANEL: IMAGES ON SCREENS FROM ALL AROUND THE SHIP. Including the EXTERIOR, where a TRANSPORT SHIP is LANDING ON THE FREIGHTER. Han is fearful. 
TASU LEECH Wrong again, Solo. It's over for you. Tasu COCKS HIS WEAPON, there for blood. BB-8 is nervous. Finn and Rey react to the sounds of the new gang -- start CRAWLING BACK the other way to see them. 
HAN Boys. You're both gonna get what I promised! Have I ever not delivered for you before? 
BALA-TIK Yeah. 
TASU LEECH Twice! Han realizes he's right. 
HAN What was the second time? 
BALA-TIK Your game is old. There's no one in the galaxy left for you to swindle. 
TASU LEECH Nowhere left for you to hide. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BALA-TIK That BB unit... the First Order is looking for one just like it. And two fugitives. Finn and Rey SUDDENLY STOP CRAWLING, tense. BB-8 hides behind Han's leg. PUSH IN ON Han as he realizes: Finn and Rey are in real trouble. 
HAN First I've heard of it. Below the grating, Finn and Rey look at each other, afraid. Above, another Kanjiklubber (RAZOO QIN-FEE) says (SUBTITLED): 
RAZOO QIN-FEE Search the freighter. One of the Kanjiklubbers begins moving down the corridor, AIMING A FLASHLIGHT DOWN BELOW, searching for: FINN AND REY, in a QUIET PANIC BELOW: THEY START CRAWLING FAST in the opposite direction they came. Rey crawls off fast, Finn follows. They quickly arrive at a JUNCTION BOX AREA, Rey looking at the controls. 
REY Wait wait wait wait. If we close the blast doors in that corridor, we can trap both gangs! 
FINN Close the blast doors from here? 
REY Resetting the fuses should do it. Rey begins RESETTING the FUSES, SPARKS shooting from them as they do. Finn quickly joins in. Rey and Finn FINISH resetting the fuses boxes. Rey smiles optimistically. Finn looks hopeful too. DOWN AN EMPTY ROW OF LARGE CONTAINERS, which OPEN -- and a GIANT RATHTAR -- an ENORMOUS, FIERCE AND RAVENOUS LAND OCTOPUS -- 
SLITHERS OUT OF ITS CAGE! BACK UP TOP as BANKS OF LIGHTS BEGIN GOING OFF, ONE BY ONE. The GANGS look around. Han's eyes go wide -- he gets it -- and it's bad. QUIETLY: 
HAN ... I got a bad feeling about this... Suddenly all the LIGHTS COME ON AGAIN -- even down below, where Rey realizes it hasn't gone as planned. 
REY Oh no. 
FINN Oh no, what? 
REY 
(PALE) Wrong fuses. 
IN ANOTHER CORRIDOR, BACK WITH THE GANGS: 
BALA-TIK Kill them! And take the droid! The gangs AIM THEIR WEAPONS JUST AS A RATHTAR APPEARS BEHIND 
THE GUAVIAN DEATH GANG, GRABBING TWO MEMBERS! THE OTHERS SCREAM AND RUN! The gang FIRES BACK -- BLASTS FLY! Han and Chewie react, flinching -- then turn to Kanjiklub as a RATHTAR APPEARS BEHIND THEM, ROARING DEAFENINGLY! The Gang turns -- others run, FIRE AT IT. 
INT. CARGO SHIP CORRIDOR A - DAY 
Han, Chewie and BB-8 race down the hall -- A MEMBER OF THE KANJIKLUB GANG comes around the corner. Han PUNCHES him with one blow, throws him toward the Rathtar. They keep steppin.... 
INT. CARGO SHIP - BELOW FLOOR GRATING - DAY 
Rey and Finn hurriedly crawl through the space below decks. 
FINN This was a mistake! 
REY Huge! 
INT. CARGO SHIP CORRIDOR A - DAY 
Two Guavian Death Gang members run through the ship -- passing Tasu Leech, who sees another Kanjiklub member down the corridor -- who gets GRABBED BY A TENTACLE! Tasu tries to help him, but he gets PULLED UP AND AWAY! Tasu hears a distant terror-scream of a Rathtar, and runs the other way. Other Kanjiklub members YELL at him to avoid that direction -- they all turn a corner -- a RATHTAR IS THERE AND GRABS THE TWO OTHERS! Tasu FIRES at the beast and RUNS OFF -- and we land on a FLOOR HATCH, which opens. Rey and Finn climb out, quickly. 
They turn a corridor -- 
REY What do they look like? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Another corner -- and GANG MEMBERS ARE BATTLING A HORRIBLE RATHTAR! Rey COVERS HER MOUTH. 
FINN They look like that. Finn yanks her away. They race around another corner -- a 
RATHTAR IS THERE! 
FINN (CONT'D) This way! 
REY Are you sure? They scream and run off -- but Finn is GRABBED, PULLED AWAY 
FAST! 
REY (CONT'D) 
FINN! But the Rathtar's fast and TURNS A CORNER, losing Rey -- 
(HUGE PROBLEM) No problem! 
INT. CARGO SHIP - HANGAR - DAY 
Three GANG MEMBERS race out here and FIRE AT THE FALCON -- hitting FUEL LINES, BLASTING THE SHIP HARD! The ship is hit. 
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY 
HAN Come on baby, don't let me down! He hits a switch -- but NOTHING. 
HAN (CONT'D) What?! But Rey reaches over, hits a switch, matter-of-factly. 
REY Compressor. Han doesn't like it but she's right -- he hits the switch again and the HYPERDRIVE FIRES! The hangar is FILLED WITH LIGHTSPEED BLAST as the ATTACKING GANG MEMBERS ARE BLASTED BACK LIKE DRY LEAVES. In the cockpit the RATHTAR RIPS AWAY as THE STARS STRETCH LIKE ELASTIC and we CUT TO: 
EXT. CARGO SHIP - DAY 
Camera ROTATES as the Falcon DISAPPEARS IN A STREAK, leaving the cargo ship behind. 
INT. CARGO SHIP - DAY 
PUSH IN on a HANGAR DOOR where Bala-Tik arrives at the window, SEETHING. Makes a CALL: 
BALA-TIK Inform the First Order that Han Solo has the droid they want. And it's aboard the Millennium Falcon. 
EXT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY 
A pair of TIE fighters roar towards a magnificent PLANET, frozen WHITE. This is the STARKILLER BASE, a natural planet that has been hacked and modified into something sinister. Over this we HEAR a DEEP, almost SOOTHING VOICE. A voice very much in control, of power: 
SNOKE (V.O.) The droid will soon be delivered to the Resistance... 
INT. STARKILLER PLANET - ASSEMBLY ROOM - NIGHT 
KYLO REN and General Hux in a dark space, looking UPWARD at someone addressing them. We're in a massive and dark ASSEMBLY ROOM. Hundreds of DESKS in a stadium arc, focused on a platform where we see SUPREME LEADER SNOKE. Not entirely human, at nearly twenty-five feet tall. All of him a STONY GREY. Old, wounded, fragile and powerful, all at the same time. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
SNOKE ... Leading them to the last Jedi. If Skywalker returns, the new Jedi will rise. 
GENERAL HUX Supreme Leader, I take full responsibility for th-- 
SNOKE General! Our strategy must now change. 
GENERAL HUX The weapon. It is ready. I believe the time has come to use it. We shall destroy the government that supports the Resistance, the Republic. Without their friends to protect them, the Resistance will be vulnerable, and we will stop them before they reach Skywalker. Snoke considers. Almost seems to die for a moment. Then: 
SNOKE Go. Oversee preparations. 
GENERAL HUX Yes, Supreme Leader. General Hux, proud, cocksure, exits. Kylo Ren watches him go. Snoke SITS. A new intimacy in his voice. 
SNOKE There's been an awakening. Have you felt it? 
KYLO REN Yes. 
SNOKE There's something more. The droid we seek is aboard the Millennium Falcon. In the hands of your father, Han Solo. Kylo Ren reacts with subtle, but real, surprise. 
KYLO REN He means nothing to me. 
SNOKE Even you, master of the Knights of Ren, have never faced such a test. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
KYLO REN 
(STEELY RESOLVE) By the grace of your training, I will not be seduced. 
SNOKE We shall see. We shall see. A gentle, satisfied nod from Snoke, and Kylo Ren, obsessed, filled up, exits. Snoke watches him disappear, a grotesque evil SMILE growing -- as he DISINTEGRATES -- Snoke has been a HOLOGRAM all along. 
EXT. LIGHTSPEED SPACE - DAY 
RACING with the Falcon through the STRINGLIGHT of lightspeed. 
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - DAY 
CHAOS: INTERCUT between the COCKPIT where Han and Rey pilot, ALARMS SOUNDING, problems everywhere, and the LOUNGE where CHEWIE YELPS as Finn nervously works to BANDAGE HIS SHOULDER. 
SPARKS! 
HAN Electrical overload! 
REY I can fix that! 
HAN The coolant's leaking! 
BEHIND THE FALCON as it DROPS OUT OF LIGHTSPEED, revealing a BEAUTIFUL GREEN PLANET ahead, TAKODANA. 
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY 
Han pilots. Finn and BB-8 beside him, Rey as co-pilot. Han notices Rey looking out the windshield, almost in tears. 
REY 
(QUIETLY) ... I didn't know there was this much green in the whole galaxy... Han watches her -- sees a vulnerability that touches him. 
EXT. TAKODANA PLANET - DAY 
The Falcon CRESTS OVER an ENDLESS GREEN FOREST TO REVEAL a CASTLE on a picturesque LAKE. The Falcon lands near the castle, among dozens of WORN, smallish freighters. 
EXT. LANDING PAD - NEAR MAZ'S CASTLE - DAY 
Rey steps off the Falcon, UP TO CAMERA, BB-8 at her side. She takes in the towering stone CASTLE, FOREST to one side, LAKE to the other. Serene, beautiful, all new to her. 
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - LOUNGE AREA - DAY 
From BLACKNESS: a storage unit opens. Han rummages, retrieving old BLASTERS. Finn arrives behind him, concerned. 
FINN Hey, Solo -- I'm not sure what we're walking into here -- 
HAN D'you just call me "Solo"? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
FINN Sorry. Han-- Mr. Solo. You should know, I'm a big deal in the Resistance. Which puts a real target on my back. Are there any conspirators here? First Order sympathizers? 
HAN Listen big deal, you've got another problem. Women always figure out the truth. Hands him a BLASTER. 
HAN (CONT'D) Always. Han walks off. Finn watches him go, wracked with guilt. 
EXT. MAZ'S CASTLE - DAY 
Han hands Rey a blaster pistol as she stands at looks at the castle. 
HAN You might need this. 
REY I think I can handle myself. 
HAN I know you do. That's why I'm giving it to you. Take it. Rey picks it up. Grips it. 
HAN (CONT'D) You know how to use one of these? 
REY Yeah, you pull the trigger. 
HAN There's a little bit more to it than that. You got a lot to learn. You got a name? 
REY Rey. 
HAN Rey. I've been thinkin' about bringing on some more crew, Rey. A second mate. Someone to help out. Someone who can keep up with Chewie and me, appreciates the Falcon. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
REY Are you offering me a job? 
HAN I wouldn't be nice to you. It doesn't pay much. 
REY You're offering me a job. 
HAN I'm thinking about it. Rey wants to say yes. But something stops her. A line she can't cross. 
HAN (CONT'D) Well? 
REY If you were, I'd be flattered. But I have to get home. Han looks at her, questioningly. 
HAN Jakku? Rey looks off, in thought. Yeah, Jakku. 
REY 
(BEAT) I've already been away too long. 
HAN 
(TO CHEWIE) Chewie, check out the ship as best you can. 
HAN (CONT'D) It's too bad. Chewie kind of likes you. Han heads off. HOLD on Rey. 
EXT. MAZ'S CASTLE - DAY 
HAN I don't know, but it ain't good. 
MAZ If you live long enough you see the same eyes in different people. I'm looking at the eyes of a man who wants to run. 
FINN (eyes on Maz) You don't know a thing about me. Where I'm from. What I've seen. 
(MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
FINN (CONT'D) You don't know the First Order like I do. They'll slaughter us. We all need to run. Rey is stunned. Maz, not so much. She crawls back to her chair. She points to some pirates in the corner. 
MAZ You see those two? They'll trade work for transportation to the Outer Rim. There, you can disappear. Finn sees them. Considers. 
REY Finn! 
FINN Come with me. 
REY What about BB-8? We're not done yet. We have to get him back to your base. 
FINN I can't. Finn stands to leave. He offers the gun back to Han. 
HAN Keep it, kid. Finn heads off. Rey gets up to follow. Maz dials her lenses back to normal, and turns to Han. 
MAZ Who's the girl? 
ON FINN Who has arrived at the table with the ALIEN SMUGGLERS. 
FINN I was told you could get me to the Outer Rim. Rey barges into the conversation, interrupting. 
REY What are you doing? Finn gets up to talk to her. 
FINN (to Big Head) Don't leave without me. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Embarrassed, Finn moves her away. 
REY You can't just go. I won't let you. 
FINN I'm not who you think I am. 
REY Finn, what are you talking about? 
FINN I'm not Resistance. I'm not a hero. I'm a Stormtrooper. 
(STOPS HER) Like all of them, I was taken from a family I'll never know. And raised to do one thing... 
(EMOTIONAL) But my first battle, I made a choice. I wasn't going to kill for them. So I ran. 
FINN (CONT'D) Right into you. And you looked at me like no one ever had. I was ashamed of what I was. But I'm done with the First Order. I'm never going back. Rey, come with me. 
REY Don't go. 
FINN Take care of yourself. Please. Rey looks at him, crushed. With quiet resignation, Rey watches Finn return to the aliens... And all three head off. He gets to the front door and walks through it. Rey is heartsick, but she turns as she hears the sound of a young girl in anguish, crying. She follows the sound into the castle, turning so she can't see that Finn has looked back at her one last time. 
INT. MAZ' CASTLE - BASEMENT CORRIDOR - DAY 
Rey steps down into the basement corridor. BB-8 follows her. Walking carefully and confused, she is not sure why she's down here. She can hear the echoing sounds of a young girl crying. She heads down the hall... to the very end, where there is a door. It is almost as if a SOULFUL VIBRATION draws her closer. She looks at the door lock -- AND THE 
DOOR OPENS. Hesitant, Rey enters. 
INT. MAZ'S CASTLE - CRYPT ROOM - DAY 
Rey moves into the dark, small, vaulted storage room. Old treasures line the floors and walls, but there is something specific Rey is drawn to: on a table, an old wooden BOX. She moves to it, unsure, afraid, as if an energy from inside the box has been calling her here. BB-8 nervously follows. Rey reaches out, very slowly, to touch the box. A moment heavy with tension. Rey OPENS THE BOX and sees inside Luke Skywalker's original lightsaber. With hesitation, she reaches towards it, but she cannot resist. As her hand makes contact with it, there is the piercing sound of a lightsaber igniting. She moves her hand away, as REY HEARS A MECHANICAL BREATHING sound. The CAMERA MOVES, LIGHTING CHANGES -- and we see behind her something impossible: a HALLWAY OF FROM DEEP INSIDE CLOUD CITY. Disembodied voices fill the air. 
YOUNG GIRL 
NO! She stands -- looks around, confused by all she sees and hears. -- Turns and sees, through a DOORWAY. We follow Rey and she runs down the corridor, but it all TILTS -- TURNS -- and she lands on the WALL -- which is now the GROUND -- dried GRASS. She turns to look -- we PIVOT -- and see a BURNING TEMPLE AT NIGHT. We PAN to: R2-D2 -- who watches the flames -- and a MAN appears (LUKE, whose face we do not see). He falls to his knees, reaches out to the droid -- with a MECHANICAL RIGHT HAND. We PUSH IN ON REY as RAIN BEGINS -- and DAY TURNS TO NIGHT -- and she LOOKS UP -- we TILT UP -- To see we're LOOKING UP AT A WARRIOR as he is STABBED BY A FIERY LIGHTSABER! He screams and falls to the ground -- we FOLLOW HIM, revealing Rey again, now in a nighttime battlefield. She gets to her feet, frightened by what she sees. We PIVOT AROUND HER to REVEAL KYLO REN, and the six other KNIGHTS OF REN, who flank him! Come back around to Rey, soaking now, as the RAIN STOPS and SUNLIGHT illuminates her -- she turns to look -- we PIVOT -- and see... A little girl. Rey as a child. She is sobbing, hysterical. Unkar Plutt's meaty hand holds her thin arm. She is on Jakku, watching a starship fly into the sky, abandoning her. 
YOUNG GIRL No, come back! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
UNKAR PLUTT Quiet, girl! The ship flies towards the desert sun, which is strangely eclipsed, as if being eaten by darkness. Rey looks around her to see she is.. In a NIGHTTIME, BARREN, SNOWY WOODS. She's losing her mind, confounded and lost and she gets to her feet, her breath seen in the frigid air -- and then: THE SOUND OF CLASHING LIGHTSABERS! She moves through the woods, toward the sound. Rey runs, heart pounding, when KYLO REN EMERGES FROM BEHIND A TREE! She stops, SCREAMS, FALLS BACK and LANDS IN: 
INT. MAZ' CASTLE - BASEMENT CORRIDOR - DAY 
She falls back, out of the room, suddenly sitting in the hall, out of breath, alarmed and perplexed. She HEARS something and turns to look. Maz stands at the end of the corridor, realizing what has just happened. 
REY What was that? I shouldn't have gone in there. 
FINN (CONT'D) The First Order, they've done it. Where's Rey? 
EXT. FOREST - DAY 
Rey races through the forest and finally comes to a stop, overwhelmed and exhausted. At an emotional breaking point, she has no idea where to go, who to turn to. Then she HEARS A BEEP -- turns to see BB-8, catching up with her. 
REY What are you doing? 
(HE BEEPS) You have to go back. (he BEEPS again) 
REY (CONT'D) BB-8. No, you can't -- you have to go back, you're too important. They'll help you. Then, ANOTHER SOUND -- LOUDER NOW -- they LOOK UP AGAIN: in front of the system attack, A FLEET OF FIRST ORDER SHIPS ROAR OVERHEAD, TOWARD THE CASTLE! Rey's heart sinks: HER 
FRIENDS ARE IN DANGER! 
INT. MAZ'S CASTLE - BASEMENT CORRIDOR - DAY 
Maz leads Han, Finn and Chewie down the hall, fast: 
MAZ I've had this for ages... 
MAZ'S CASTLE - TREASURE ROOM - DAY Maz opens the box -- holds out the lightsaber to Finn: 
MAZ Kept it locked away. 
HAN Where'd you get that? 
MAZ A good question for another time. 
(TO FINN) Take it! Find your friend! Finn grabs it as the room is SHAKEN by an above ground attack. 
MAZ (CONT'D) Those beasts! They're here! 
EXT. FOREST - DAY 
Rey and BB-8 race fast back toward the castle -- EXPLOSION SOUNDS can be HEARD from the direction they're headed! 
EXT. FOREST - DAY 
Rey races through the trees -- sees Maz' castle -- BEING DESTROYED BY FIRST ORDER SHIPS! Aliens RUNNING, GETTING OBLITERATED by SCREAMING TIE FIGHTERS! Other TIE FIGHTERS and TRANSPORTERS LAND, STORMTROOPERS in attack. Just then, filtered RADIO CALLS get Rey's attention: nearby STORMTROOPERS have spotted her, AND FIRE! 
STORMTROOPER FN-417, hold position! Rey takes cover, grabs her BLASTER -- but IT WON'T FIRE! She panics, then realizes: 
REY Safety! SHE SWITCHES OFF THE SAFETY and FIRES BACK! HITS TWO TROOPERS and retreats, calls to BB-8: BB-8 follows Rey AWAY FROM THE CASTLE, firing back at more chasing Troopers! 
EXT. MAZ' CASTLE RUINS - DAY 
Kylo Ren moves through the DEBRIS. A Stormtrooper approaches: 
STORMTROOPER #4 Sir, the droid was spotted heading west, with a girl. Kylo Ren LOOKS BACK SHARPLY, in Rey's direction -- 
EXT. FOREST - DAY 
Rey and BB-8 move swiftly, terrified -- she stops them: 
REY You have to keep going, stay out of sight, I'll try to fight 'em off. (BB-8 BEEPS; bravely through her fear) I hope so, too. BB-8 BEEPS and heads off -- Rey RUNS and TAKES COVER behind a massive, mossy tree. TIGHT on her TERRIFIED FACE -- 
EXT. CASTLE DEBRIS - DAY 
Han, Chewie, Finn and Maz, exhausted, CLIMB UP, peek through debris. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
HAN Come on, Chewie! Maz turns to Finn: 
MAZ Rey and BB-8, they need you. Now go. 
FINN I need a weapon. Maz grabs his wrist -- holds up his hand -- THE SABER. 
MAZ You have one! He looks at her questioningly -- he's supposed to use the lightsaber?! He TURNS IT ON. HAN AND CHEWIE RUN, TAKE COVER from BLASTS, FIRING BACK at Stormtroopers, taking some out! 
HAN Hey, can I try that? Han borrows Chewbacca's bowcaster, fires on Stormtroopers and sends them flying. 
HAN (CONT'D) 
(TO CHEWBACCA) I like this thing. FINN SURPRISES A STORMTROOPER WITH THE LIGHTSABER, then another! Untrained, he's athletic, brave, impressive. One Stormtrooper has a MACE -- 
STORMTROOPER Traitor! FINN and the TROOPER WITH THE MACE battle. The Mace Trooper KNOCKS FINN DOWN! The Stormtrooper is about to end him, when THE STORMTROOPER IS SHOT AND FALLS! Wide-eyed Finn sees Han run over, having fired the blast! Han helps him up. 
HAN You okay, Big deal? 
FINN Thanks! But TEN STORMTROOPERS come over a RISE, BLASTERS AIMED. 
STORMTROOPER Don't move! TK-338, we have targets in custody! 
(LONG BEAT) It was Snoke. Han takes this in. 
LEIA (CONT'D) He seduced our son to the dark side. But we can still save him. Me. You. 
HAN If Luke couldn't reach him, how could 
I? 
LEIA Luke is a Jedi... you're his father. There's still light in him. I know it. 
GENERAL STATURA General, the reconnaissance report on the enemy base is coming. 
INT. STARKILLER BASE - HOLDING CELL - DAY 
Rey wakes, disoriented. She is in an angled, upright restraining rig. Looks over, startled to see Kylo Ren, mask in place, standing there. 
REY Where am I? 
KYLO REN 
(LONG BEAT) You're my guest. 
REY Where are the others? 
KYLO REN You mean the murderers, traitors and thieves you call friends? (Rey stares at him) You'll be relieved to hear that I have no idea. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Rey studies him. She's fearful... but curious. 
KYLO REN (CONT'D) You still want to kill me. 
REY That happens when you're being hunted by a creature in a mask. Kylo Ren stops, considers her... then reaches up, unlatches and REMOVES HIS MASK. Rey reacts, stunned. It takes a moment before she regains her own mask of defiance. 
KYLO REN Tell me about the droid. 
REY (a nervous beat) He's a BB unit with a selenium drive and a thermal hyperscan vindicator -- 
KYLO REN He's carrying a section of a navigational chart. We have the rest, recovered from archives of the Empire. We need the last piece. And somehow, you convinced the droid to show it to you. You. A scavenger -- Rey reacts -- afraid -- how does he know? 
KYLO REN (CONT'D) You know I can take whatever I want. Trepidation flashes across Rey's eyes. Kylo Ren moves closer, his hand rising toward her. She recoils, but has nowhere to go. Kylo Ren nearly TOUCHES HER FACE... THEY'RE BOTH SURPRISED: they react to a feeling that passes between them -- AN ENERGY THEY RECOGNIZE IN EACH OTHER. And then it's gone. Adversaries again. Rey can't move, quietly strains in agony, trying to resist Ren's probing. 
KYLO REN (CONT'D) ... You're so lonely... so afraid to leave... (then, slight smile) At night, desperate to sleep... you imagine an ocean. I see it -- I see the island... Tears stream down her face as she resists. She tries to break free, but can't budge. 
KYLO REN (CONT'D) And Han Solo. You feel like he's the father you never had. He would've disappointed you. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: His hand still on her face, her eyes fierce through the agony: 
REY -- Get out of my head -- But this just makes Kylo lean closer. 
KYLO REN I know you've seen the map. It's in there... and now you'll give it to me. Don't be afraid. I feel it too. Where her strength comes from, she doesn't know, but: 
REY I'm not giving you anything. 
KYLO REN We'll see. He peers into her eyes intensely. She meets his gaze -- 
DESPITE THE PAIN SHE IS STRONG. On Ren's face as HIS CONFIDENCE BEGINS TO MELT AWAY. He has slammed up against a barrier in her mind. He looks less certain by the moment as Rey seems to GROW IN STRENGTH. The FEROCITY of confrontation builds until it hits critical mass 
AND REY DOES THE UNTHINKABLE! SHE ENTERS HIS HEAD, AMAZED 
AT WHAT SHE IS SEEING! 
REY ... You... you're afraid... that you will never be as strong as... Darth Vader! KYLO REN SUDDENLY WITHDRAWS HIS HAND, as if her face were FIRE HOT. TAKES A STEP BACK, CONFUSED, RATTLED. Rey's body is released, she breathes deeply, her powerful eyes still on Kylo Ren, who starts to leave. And we PRELAP: 
SNOKE (V.O.) This scavenger, resisted you? 
INT. STARKILLER PLANET - ASSEMBLY ROOM - NIGHT 
Kylo Ren, mask off, stands before Snoke. 
KYLO REN She's strong with the Force, untrained but, stronger than she knows. And while Ren's mind no doubt goes to Luke: 
SNOKE And the droid? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Kylo Ren hesitates to reveal the truth. Then: 
GENERAL HUX (O.S.) Ren believed it was no longer valuable to us. Ren turns back -- Hux enters the large space, moves to the platform beside Ren. 
GENERAL HUX (CONT'D) That the girl was all we needed. As a result, the droid has most likely been returned to the hands of the enemy. They may have the map already. Snoke is visibly furious. 
SNOKE Then the Resistance must be destroyed before they get to Skywalker. 
MAJOR EMATT 
(HORRIBLE MEMORIES) It's another Death Star. 
POE I wish that were the case, Major. Poe hits a control. A WIREFRAME OF THE DEATH STAR APPEARS. 
POE (CONT'D) This was the Death Star. Poe hits another control -- the Death Star SHRINKS -- AND SHRINKS AND SHRINKS, as the SURFACE AREA OF THE STARKILLER 
BASE IS DRAWN INTO A LARGER IMAGE, REVEALING THE ENTIRE BASE PLANET. The Death Star is a minuscule SATELLITE in comparison. 
POE (CONT'D) This is Starkiller Base. This is news to many here, and they're stunned. 
HAN So it's big. 
ADMIRAL ACKBAR How is it possible to power a weapon of this size? 
FINN It uses the power of the sun. As the weapon is charged, the sun is drained until it disappears. An OFFICER runs up, hands Leia a DATACARD. 
LEIA (eyes on datacard) The First Order: they're charging the weapon again, now. (then, heart sinking) Our system is the next target. 
C-3PO Oh my. Without the Republic fleet, we're doomed. They all react to this horrible news. 
HAN Okay, how do we blow it up? (all eyes on him) There's always a way to do that. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: But no one has anything. Leia watches the silence, frustrated. Finally, rallying them: 
LEIA Han's right. Han is surprised. 
ADMIRAL STATURA (at first hesitant) In order for that amount of power to be contained, that base would need some kind of thermal oscillator... 
FINN There is one. All eyes on Finn as he moves around the hologram to a location on the Starkiller Base -- it is ZOOMED IN: A GIANT BLACK 
HEXAGONAL STRUCTURE. 
FINN (CONT'D) Precinct 47. Here. 
ADMIRAL STATURA 
(HYPOTHESIZING) If we can destroy that oscillator, it might de-stabilize the core and cripple the weapon. 
MAJOR EMATT ... Maybe the planet. Poe then tries to bolster spirits, looking at the BIG HEXAGONAL STRUCTURE: the Oscillator. 
POE We'll go in there and we'll hit that oscillator with everything we got. 
ADMIRAL ACKBAR They have defensive shields that our ships cannot penetrate. 
HAN We disable the shields. 
(TO FINN) Kid, you worked there, what do you got? 
FINN (beat, then:) I can do it. 
HAN I like this guy. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
FINN I can disable the shields. But I have to be there, on the planet-- 
HAN We'll get you there. 
LEIA Han, how? 
HAN If I told you, you wouldn't like it. 
POE So we disable the shields, take out the oscillator and we blow up their big gun. All right. Let's go! And everyone splits. 
EXT. HANGARS, RESISTANCE BASE - DAY 
SERIES OF SHOTS: THE RESISTANCE FLEET PREPARES FOR ITS MISSION. Pilots inspect crafts, including Snap, Nien Nunb, and Poe at his black-marked X-wing. Mechanics make adjustments as Crews fuel the jets. Ground controllers move ships into takeoff formation. Pilots prep their ships, including BB-8, who is PULLED INTO Poe's black X-wing. Finn approaches Poe wearing the jacket. Poe slaps Finn's shoulder as he heads off. Finn watches Poe, despite it all, a little laugh. Over this: 
EXT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY 
Chewie and Finn follow Han's orders as they prepare the Falcon for one more daring run, maybe its last: 
HAN Chewie, check that donal capitator. Come on. Let's go. -- Finn, be careful with those - they're explosives. 
FINN Now you tell me? 
LEIA No matter how much we fought, I've always hated watching you leave. Han looks over, there's Leia. 
HAN That's what I did it. So you'd miss me. She laughs, moves up close to him. 
EXT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY 
MASSIVE WIDE SHOT of an EPIC SNOWSCAPE. Han, Finn and Chewie cross the terrain. WALKERS appears on the horizon. Han, Finn and Chewie take cover behind a base structure. Chewie carries a BLACK DUFFEL of EXPLOSIVES. 
FINN The flooding tunnels are over that ridge. We'll get in that way. 
HAN What was your job when you were based here? 
FINN Sanitation. 
HAN Sanitation? Then how do you know how to disable the shields? 
FINN I don't. I'm just here to get Rey. 
HAN People are counting on us! The galaxy is counting on us--! 
FINN Solo, we'll figure it out! We'll use the Force! 
HAN That's not how the Force works--! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Chewie MOANTALKS. 
HAN (CONT'D) Oh really, you're cold? 
FINN Come on! They follow Finn on the snowy hike. On the horizon, THE 
LASER SIPHON SHOOTING INTO THE SKY, SLOWLY SUCKING THE SUN 
DRY. 
INT. STARKILLER BASE - CONTROL ROOM - DAY 
Technicians at work, the SUN SUCKING seen in the window behind him. 
GENERAL HUX Report. 
FIRST ORDER OFFICER Weapon charged in fifteen minutes, sir. 
INT. STARKILLER BASE - CORRIDOR 4 - DAY 
A STORMTROOPER waits to board a Transport Compartment. The door WHOOSHES open -- HAN, FINN and CHEWIE are there! 
STORMTROOPER FN-9330 Hey! He fumbles for his blaster but Chewie shoots first. WIDE ANGLE of the corridor as the Trooper flies back, dead. Chewie drags him out of sight. Han and Finn peer around a corner, wary. 
HAN The longer we're here, less luck we're going to have. The shields? 
FINN I have an idea about that. Han and Chewie follow Finn. 
INT. STARKILLER BASE - CORRIDOR - DAY 
Captain Phasma heads down a corridor, distant Stormtroopers. Suddenly Phasma is T-BONED HARD AND FAST -- SHOVED OUT OF 
FRAME BY CHEWIE! And now we're in a NARROW CROSS-CORRIDOR, CHEWIE WITH HIS 
ARMS AROUND PHASMA, FORCED TO FACE FINN, WHO HOLDS HIS BLASTER ON HIS FORMER CAPTAIN. Han stands behind Finn. 
FINN Remember me? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
CAPTAIN PHASMA 
FN-2187. 
FINN Not anymore. The name's Finn, and I'm in charge. I'm in charge now, Phasma. I'm in charge. 
HAN Bring it down. Bring it down. 
FINN Follow me. Finn SMILES as we CUT TO: 
INT. STARKILLER BASE - ATRIUM AREA - DAY 
TIGHT ON REY'S FACE as she peers nervously around a corner. Rey runs down a long, glossy hall, taking cover in an alcove, the Trooper Guard's rifle HELD TIGHT. From this alcove, she can see down another LONG, PERPENDICULAR WALKWAY -- on one side, a STONE AND STEEL WALL. On the other side, a VAST ATRIUM, with a railing-free DROP OFF, the white pill-light design descending HUNDREDS OF FEET. At the end of this walkway is an OPEN HANGAR DOOR, revealing HUNDREDS OF TIE FIGHTERS parked outside. TIGHT on Rey's face as her plan is clear. But the problem: between her and the ship she wants to steal, is a GROUP OF STORMTROOPERS. Guards, in conversation. As she tries to think about what to do next, we see, FAR BEHIND HER in the perpendicular hall, ANOTHER GROUP OF STORM- and SNOWTROOPERS headed her way! Rey's mind races -- another peek out and she RUNS FAST, across the walkway, and CLIMBS DOWN -- her fingertips disappearing over the edge just as the Troopers approach and continue. WIDE SHOT as Rey holds on carefully as the guards walk off, not seeing her over the edge, a death drop below her. But then she SEES SOMETHING and has a brainstorm. She strenuously cross-climbs to an invisible SERVICE HATCH, which She opens, and climbs INSIDE THE WALL, closing the hatch behind her. 
INT. STARKILLER BASE - INSIDE THE WALLS - DAY 
A REMARKABLE IMAGE, inside the inner workings of the base. Tiny by comparison, Rey climbs amid the incredible infrastructure, a drop to infinity beneath her. She is between the LIGHT SOURCE and the WHITE PILL SHAPES, as she makes her way ACROSS. 
INT. STARKILLER BASE - ATRIUM AREA - DAY 
WIDE SHOT of the Stormtrooper GUARDS, above the drop off into the atrium. What they cannot see is a SHADOWED SILHOUETTE OF REY against the ENDLESS WHITE PILL LIGHTS as she climbs across the space, beneath them, toward her exit! 
SNAP Approaching target. 
INT. X-WING - DAY 
Nien Nunb acknowledges. 
INT. STARKILLER BASE - CONTROL ROOM - DAY 
LARGE EXPLOSIONS atop the DISTANT OSCILLATOR, seen through the large windows! ALARMS BLARE in here -- we PULL BACK as Hux moves quickly to see the damage, he turns sharply to a First Order Officer: 
GENERAL HUX Dispatch all squadrons... 
COLONEL DATOO Yes, General. 
INT. X-WING - DAY 
POE Let's light it up! 
DIVE BOMBING THE OSCILLATOR, HITTING IT DEAD CENTER IN QUICK 
SUCCESSION! 
INT. X-WING - DAY 
LT. BASTIAN Direct hit! 
ELLO ASTY But no damage! Jess reacts. 
POE Yeah, we gotta keep hitting it! Another bombing run! Remember, when that sun is gone, that weapon will be ready to fire! But as long as there's light, we got a chance. 
INT. X-WING - DAY 
A BEEPING from BB-8, riding in the back of his X-wing, and Poe looks out -- can't believe what he's seeing: DOZENS OF 
TIE FIGHTERS! 
POE Guys, we got a lot of company! 
INT. STARKILLER BASE - JUNCTION AREA - DAY 
Finn, Han and Chewie take cover, Chewie pulling some EXPLOSIVES out of the duffel. Blast doors nearby. 
FINN We'll use the charges to blow that blast door. I'll go in and draw fire, but I'm gonna need cover. 
HAN You sure you're up for this? 
FINN Hell no -- I'll go in find and try to find Rey -- (improvising, fast) -- The troopers'll be on our tail. We have to be ready for that. There's an access tunnel that'll leads -- (Han starts pointing with his chin to 
SOMETHING BEHIND 
FINN) Why are you doing that? Why are you doing -- this? I'm trying to come up with a plan. Finn turns -- AND SEES REY, CLIMBING OUT FROM INSIDE THE WALL, carefully climbing back up to the main level! He can't believe it! Chewie MURMURS his relief. Han is maybe more grateful than anyone. 
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY 
A Resistance Technician turns to Leia: 
ADMIRAL ACKBAR The Oscillator's still standing. 
OFFICER X-wings coming back for another round of attacks! 
INT. STARKILLER BASE - CORRIDOR 6 - DAY 
Rey climbs up to the corridor, vigilant. She hears a SOUND, SWOOPS her rifle at -- Finn, Han and Chewie! She cannot believe it! All Finn wants to do is hug her -- and she him. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
HAN Are you all right? 
REY Yeah. 
HAN Good. 
FINN What happened -- did he hurt you? 
REY Finn. What are you doing here?! 
FINN We came back for you. She is speechless -- this is all she's ever wanted anyone to do. Chewie TALKS -- and Rey's eyes nearly tear up. 
FINN (CONT'D) What'd he say? 
REY (shrugs, smiles, though nearly in tears) ... That it was your idea. Finn awkwardly smiles. It's his nature. They embrace. 
REY (CONT'D) Thank you.

FADE IN: 
1   INT. FLORIDA COURTROOM - DAY                                  1 
Northern Florida in the midst of a heat wave. Air conditioners fighting a losing battle. The gallery is full. The JUDGE a stern, old hand. The PROSECUTOR, an efficient man with a good case. 
The witness is BARBARA. She is maybe 13. She is a witness in a criminal trial. Her testimony has been carefully rehearsed. 
BARBARA ... we go back to our homeroom for dismissal, unless you have a pass for sports or something. 
PROSECUTOR (O.S.) And is that what you did on the day in question? 
BARBARA No. Mr. Gettys asked me to stay after class. 
PROSECUTOR What happened next, Barbara? 
BARBARA Mr. Gettys closed the door. 
PROSECUTOR Everyone else had gone? 
BARBARA Yes. He told me to sit in the chair beside his desk. 
MR. GETTYS, the defendant, is 50. The very picture of respectability. His perfect wife and son staunchly enduring this testimony.

PROSECUTOR In your own words, Barbara, can you tell us exactly what happened during the next few minutes? 
KEVIN LOMAX.    Defense counsel.   Taking it all in. 
BARBARA (O.S.) I told him I was afraid I would miss my bus. He promised I would get to the bus on time if I would help him to do something... 
Kevin -- his eyes -- drifting around the courtroom -- taking inventory -- assessing damage -- 
BARBARA (O.S.) ... Then he put -- before I could say anything -- he placed his hand inside my blouse... 
Kevin -- checking the jury and -- 
BARBARA (O.S.) ... I was so frightened I didn't move. I thought if I was just quiet it would be okay... 
Kevin -- checking Gettys -- seeing something that stops him cold -- 
BARBARA (O.S.) ... Then his other hand went up under -- inside my skirt... 
Gettys' hand -- down below the table -- down where no one but Kevin could possibly see it -- Getty's fingers subtly feeling their way along the leg of his chair -- 
BARBARA (O.S.) ... his hand then, it started, he started, moving back and forth -- farther and farther inside my skirt... 
Kevin -- glancing around -- nobody else can see it -- 
BARBARA (O.S.) ... he said he was testing to see if I had any special feelings, that he wanted to find out what kind of feelings I had... 
(CONTINUED) 
1   CONTINUED:    (2)                                               1 
Gettys' hand -- excited now -- stroking the chair leg -- absently -- involuntarily -- unmistakably sexual -- 
BARBARA (O.S.) ... I didn't know what to say, I was trying to think of something to say but I was confused and he just kept on -- with his hand -- moving it -- under my dress -- higher and higher... 
Kevin is rocked.    Trying not to show it. 
BARBARA (O.S.) ... then I, I was asking him to stop but it was like he couldn't hear me -- he just kept on -- 
Suddenly, Gettys' hand stops moving -- 
BARBARA (O.S.) -- and then I screamed... 
Kevin looks up to find Gettys' eyes waiting for him. Gettys quickly returns his hand into his lap. He's been caught -- watching, as Kevin turns away and -- 
BARBARA ... then he, he got mad and said we would have to try again sometime. 
PROSECUTOR And did he try again? 
BARBARA Not with me. 
PROSECUTOR With friends of yours? 
BARBARA Yes. 
PROSECUTOR And when you told them what he had done to you, they told you what he had done to them, isn't that true? 
BARBARA Yes. 
PROSECUTOR I have nothing further.

JUDGE (finding Kevin) Your witness, Mr. Lomax. 
KEVIN Any chance, Your Honor, for a short recess? 
PROSECUTOR Objection, Your Honor, we've had plenty of time for discovery here. 
The Judge quickly studying his copy of the note. 
JUDGE I'm gonna let this in, Mr. Lomax, I'm also gonna suggest that if you have any other exhibits you present in a timely fashion or not at all. 
KEVIN (right to the note) I'm sorry, Barbara, I was wrong, it's 'huge hog beast'. This is your handwriting, isn't it? 
BARBARA Yes, but --

KEVIN You wrote this in his class. 
BARBARA It's a joke. 
KEVIN 'He's a huge hog beast. He probably eats a thousand pancakes for breakfast.' You're writing here about Mr. Gettys, aren't you? 
BARBARA It was meant to be a joke. 
KEVIN Have you ever had a party at your house when your parents were away? (waiting) Yes or no? 
PROSECUTOR Objection.   This is way out of... 
KEVIN Credibility and bias. 
JUDGE Overruled.   Answer the question. 
BARBARA (rattled) Yes. 
KEVIN The word special came up in your testimony earlier. You claimed that Mr. Gettys asked you whether you had special feelings, if you felt special. (beat) Have you ever heard of a game called 'Special Places?' (waiting) You're under oath, Barbara. A man's career -- his reputation -- his life is on the line. This is not a joke. Have you ever played the game Special Places? 
BARBARA Yes.

KEVIN Is this game sexual in nature? (waiting) Is this game sexual in nature? 
BARBARA We only played it once. 
KEVIN This special party, Barbara, this was the first time you told the story about Mr. Gettys. 
BARBARA Yes. 
KEVIN I've spoken to the other children who were there that day. Can you think of anything else, Barbara, they might have told me about that party? 
PROSECUTOR Objection. Your Honor, if he has other witnesses let him call them. 
KEVIN (right at Barbara) If I need to call those other children, I will. 
JUDGE I'm gonna sustain that, Mr. Lomax. Rephrase your question. 
KEVIN You threatened those children, didn't you? 
BARBARA That's not the way it happened -- 
KEVIN You told them to falsely claim that Mr. Gettys had hurt them, didn't you? 
BARBARA These things did happen!

KEVIN Because if they didn't go along you were going to tell everyone about this special party. 
BARBARA They happened to me. 
KEVIN So you made up a story. A special story, about a math teacher -- a disgusting pig monster -- you didn't like. That's what really happened, isn't it? 
BARBARA I didn't want to be the only one! 
BARBARA'S FATHER can take it no longer -- suddenly on his feet -- charging -- 
BARBARA'S FATHER You son of a bitch! 
The bailiff making a diving grab -- 
KEVIN I have no further questions, Your Honor. 
Chaos -- court officers struggling with Barbara's Father and people yelling and Gettys hugging his wife and son and the gavel banging like mad and Kevin just sitting there, staring at the floor, completely drained, emotionally, morally, physically and -- 
In the back of the room, a man. He's black. Elegant. Amused by the scene. His name is LEAMON HEATH. 
MARY ANN LOMAX leans in behind her husband.      She is a doll. We love her.

6   INT. FLORIDA NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT                                    6 
It's a rock and roll joint. Florida style. But it's early and empty. Kevin at the bar with Mary Ann, two LAWYER friends, the Reporter and someone's girl friend. 12 shot glasses, two rows of six. A perfect tequila pour and -- 
LAWYER #1 (O.S.) In the event we all get drunk and forget, I suggest we frontload the ceremonial bullshit... (a toast) To the best damn trial lawyer in Alachua County. 
Kevin, subdued, watches the rest of them drink. 
REPORTER So, Kev, off the record, how's it feel to squeeze a man like Gettys through the door of reasonable doubt? 
Kevin turns.       There he is. 
MILTON Sorry.    Didn't mean to... 
KEVIN No.  Please. (his hand) Kevin Lomax. 
MILTON (they shake) John Milton. 
KEVIN Nice to meet you. 
MILTON Have we been treating you well? 
KEVIN Very well.    Thank you. 
(CONTINUED)

MILTON Your wife, she's had a good time? 
KEVIN She sure has. It's been great. The whole thing's been great. 
MILTON Good. That's our secret. We kill you with kindness. (walking the room, circling) What's your secret? 
KEVIN I couldn't say. 
MILTON You were a prosecutor. 
KEVIN Out of law school. Five years in the Jacksonville D.A.'s office. 
MILTON Sixty-four straight convictions. What a number. 
KEVIN I like to be in court.   I didn't plea out a lot. 
MILTON What's that like? One day you're putting them away and the next you're setting them free? 
KEVIN Takes a little getting used to. 
MILTON Pays better though, doesn't it? 
KEVIN Yes it does. 
MILTON The math teacher. The Gettys case. I hear you were brilliant. 
KEVIN Prosecutor dropped the ball.

MILTON Really.   So you think your guy was guilty. 
KEVIN I didn't say that. 
MILTON What did you say? 
KEVIN How's this? I began the case with a clear conscience. 
MILTON (quiet a moment) I was sure you had a secret. 
KEVIN The men's room. (beat) Upstairs men's room in the Duval County courthouse. There's a hole in the wall. Straight through to the next room. (smiles) I spent five years listening to juries deliberate. 
MILTON I love it. 
KEVIN Love it all you want, just don't repeat it. I'm not sure the Florida Bar Association would appreciate it. 
MILTON You don't really want to go back to Florida, do you? Walk with me. 
27   INT. MILTON'S OFFICE - PANEL - DAY                                27 
With that, Milton pushes a button.     Huge panel screens open out to: 
28   EXT. MILTON'S TERRACE - DAY                                       28 
A reflecting pool. Water right to the edge. A narrow walkway straight through the middle. And we're fifty stories above the city. The effect is staggering.

MILTON What do you think? Some people can't handle it. 
KEVIN It's peaceful. 
MILTON Exactly. (pleased) Fill in the resume. Tell me about your family. What does your father do? 
KEVIN I never got to know my father. He passed away before I was born. My mom raised me. Just the two of us. 
MILTON She never remarried? 
KEVIN She wasn't married the first time. 
MILTON That can't be easy in Gainesville. 
KEVIN I don't think it's easy anywhere. (re the view) Holy shit... 
MILTON Little different when you're looking down, isn't it? (beat) Tell me about her. Your mother. What's she like? 
KEVIN She's a preacher's daughter. She's tough. She's worked in the same poultry plant for as long as I can remember. I think she's up to eight-fifty an hour. She's got a church she really likes, so she's usually either there or they go out, they do a lot of volunteer work.

KEVIN I sure as hell hope so. 
MARY ANN They must want you pretty bad. 
KEVIN Look, Mare, I'm only getting behind this if you're on board. You want to go home, I'm with you. 
MARY ANN Sure. Let's go back to Gainesville. You can keep scrounging for clients and pumping out the basement and I'll keep repossessing cars for Akamian. Maybe, if we kill ourselves, in about five years we can afford a baby and a weekend shack at Gulf Shores. (beat) Are you shitting me? 
She smiles first.      Kevin pulling her toward him, as we --

34   INT. FIRM CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY                                      34 
Incredible and extreme. Forty people -- SENIOR PARTNERS and department heads -- seated at the table. They've been going around the table introducing themselves to Kevin. Nearing the end now -- 
LAWYER #1 Krasna.   Maritime Law. 
LAWYER #2 Parvathi Resh. Energy law.     I run the Islamic sub-group. 
LAWYER #3 Joyce Rensaleer. Mergers and acquisitions. 
LAWYER #4 Chan Sanyou.   Intellectual property. 
BARZOON Eddie Barzoon.     Managing Director. 
Christabella and another woman running in.       Taking seats quickly. Christabella beside Kevin.

CHRISTABELLA Christabella Adrioli. Economics. Primarily G-7 and E.C. 
MILTON There you go, Kevin. The whole team. I'm trying to think how long it's been since we were all together. All of us. Too long. I'm looking around, I know some of you came from very far away to be with us here today. It's appreciated. (pacing the window) This room we're in was built -- architecturally designed -- to promote healthy group dynamics. A psychic centrifuge. Makes you want to reach out, doesn't it? Inclusion. Commonality. Synergy. All that good shit. That's what I'm looking for today. Because when I hear stories -- the kind of stories I've been hearing -- about backbiting, about partners not working together, departments cutting each other's throats over clients, or worse... I feel drained. It drains me. I feel empty. I feel as though I've let you all down. (off dead silence) We need something. A gesture. (across the table) What do I need, Eddie? 
BARZOON How about a public flogging? 
MILTON Wait a minute. I got it. It's perfect. It's intimate. It's quick. Doesn't cost a thing. There's a power to it. What is it? (beat) Let's hold hands. All of us. Together. 
Milton is first.    Reluctance begins to fold.

MILTON Right now. Every person at this table -- take the hand of the person on either side... 
Kevin finds Christabella's hand at his side. 
MILTON You want out of this, Eddie? 
BARZOON You've made your point, John. 
MILTON You won't hold hands? (stare-down) It's important to me, Eddie. 
Kevin watching Barzoon fold.       Watching the circle form. 
MILTON See.   See, I feel better already.

HEATH What do you think? 
KEVIN (kidding) I guess it'll do. 
PAM (O.S.) Until something better comes along... 
In the doorway, PAM GARRETY.       Never married.   Two-pack-a- day habit. Tough as dirt.

HEATH (CONT'D) (as they shake) Pam was with the Brooklyn D.A.'s office for fourteen years, so she knows her way around the local scene. She'll be your guide. (to Pam) You're gonna be expediting his New York Bar application, right? 
PAM In the pipeline. For now, we'll just have you work pro hac vice. We've petitioned Florida for a letter of good conduct. And... (a folder) ... I prepared, at Mr. Milton's request, an overview of the Moyez case. 
KEVIN The Moyez case?

A storefront botanica. Insane colors. Rusted iron grates covering two tiny cataract windows. A steel door is open. There's a sick-looking DOG tied to the doorknob; he begins BARKING wildly, as he sees -- 
KEVIN What are you doing, Mr. Moyez? 
Moyez stands aside, wiping his hands on his trousers.        A huge beef tongue sits on the bench. The nails are scattered around it. 
MOYEZ You can go now. You will have all the help I can give you. 
Moyez now with a hammer. And the nail. Driving it into the tongue. Kevin backing away, as we --

Hand-held footage of a police raid. We're running -- through a building -- New York cops -- an animal control officer -- through a door -- voices yelling -- down some steps -- into a back yard -- people standing -- 
Here -- a scuffle starting -- voices rising -- the camera shaking -- we see Bhalla -- and the Woman -- and -- 
There -- in the middle, is a goat -- on its knees -- its throat has just been cut -- blood pouring into a pan and Moyez holding its head with one hand -- a knife in the other and this positively orgiastic expression on his face, and on that image, we freeze frame.

PAM What do you think? 
KEVIN It's a health code case. And it's a loser. So what's the point? (watching her) It's a test, right? 
PAM Isn't everything? 
KEVIN The smart thing to do is make a deal. Plea him out and suppress the tape. 
PAM I'm sure the D.A.'s waiting for your call. 
KEVIN Yeah, well, let him wait. (beat) And you can tell Milton too. (beat) I didn't come to New York to plea bargain.

Bench trial. No jury. JUDGE THEO SKLAR and staff. A.D.A. MERTO at his seat. Pam sits with Moyez. Other than that, it's empty. 
A rump roast slaps down onto a table. 
KEVIN (O.S.) That's a veal roast, Your Honor. U.S.D.A. approved and stamped. Eight days ago, in Kansas City, two men pushed a calf into a steel frame as a third man fired a high- voltage staple-gun into the animal's skull. Men kill animals and eat their flesh. Phillipe Moyez killed a goat. He killed a goat. And he did it at home, in a manner consistent with his religious beliefs. Now some people may find it bizarre. (MORE)

KEVIN (O.S.CONT'D) It's certainly not a religious practice performed by everyone. It's not as common as, say, circumcision. It's certainly not as common as the belief that wine is transformed into blood. It's not even as common as the handling of poisonous snakes to prove one's faith. But Phillipe Moyez isn't two thousand miles away in a stockyard. He doesn't use electricity to kill. And worst of all... (holding up the roast) Phillipe Moyez is not shrink- wrapped. 
Merto begins to cough.    Quietly at first, but... 
KEVIN Your Honor, the city timed this police action to catch my client exercising his constitutionally- protected right to religious freedom. 
Merto's coughing getting worse as he tries to stop... 
JUDGE SKLAR This is a law protecting Kosher butchering. 
KEVIN Exactly, Your Honor. And I'd like to move at this time for an immediate directed verdict for dismissal. 
Moyez staring a hole in Merto, and the man cannot stop coughing... 
JUDGE SKLAR I happen to know a little bit about Kashrut law, Mr. Lomax.

He stops. In the hallway -- a wall is missing -- sheetrock stacked on the floor -- tools piled around -- a renovation project halted for the night. 
KEVIN What's all this? 
MARY ANN (O.S.) All what? 
Mary Ann up the hall in the bedroom door.      Finishing her makeup for a night out. 
MARY ANN Oh, that... (smiles) It was gonna be a nursery, but then I remembered you'd have to be home long enough to knock me up, so now I'm thinking of building a law library. 
Kevin smiles.    Drops his briefcase.     Drops his pants. 
MARY ANN Save the thought. We were due up there fifteen minutes ago. 
She blows him a kiss.    Ducking back into bedroom.

DIANA I love the eights. The entire 'A' line -- such a great shell. (manic and perhaps a bit insane) I do. I envy you. Starting from scratch. Do you have your fabrics yet? Tell me you don't. 
MARY ANN Not yet.   I don't think so. 
DIANA Come with me. Instantly. (to Kevin) I'm borrowing your wife... 
BARZOON Be gentle, honey. These are normal people.

CHRISTABELLA No, I live downtown. This is the family building. 
KEVIN Sounds like fun. Downtown, I mean. I'm just getting to know the city. 
CHRISTABELLA Is it everything you expected? 
KEVIN More. 
CHRISTABELLA (raising her glass) May we always have more than we expect. Salute.

KEVIN You don't have time to shop, Mr. Cullen. (the newspaper) Jury selection started this morning at every breakfast table in the city. You lost round one. This is what people know. They know you and your wife were living separately. They see this maid -- Elucinda -- a sixty-eight-year-old grandmother supporting seven children. And then there's your stepson, a ten-year-old with a bullet in his brain. Those are already powerful images in the mind of the public. 
CULLEN I didn't kill anybody. 
KEVIN I'm telling you how it looks. You discover the crime. You call it in. You've got blood on your person and clothes, and -- (before Cullen can cut him off) -- and -- your prints are on the murder weapon.

JACKIE Dr. Robert,   I'm telling you, he's the miracle   man. You've seen my new tits, I   mean who does it better than   that?

MELISSA I can't do it. It's one thing to have an affair with your boss, it's another to have to tell the world in a murder case. 
MARY ANN You won't stay. I know you. You'll leave me now for sure. (as he moves to comfort her -- ) Get-away-from-me! 
KEVIN Okay.  I'm confused. (furious) Why? What is it now? What the fuck is it today, Mare? I swear to God, I'm calling this doctor, I'm gonna find out what the hell they're giving you. 
MARY ANN They took my ovaries. I told you! (tears now) My sisters have seven children between them. My mother had Derek when she was forty-five. You could set a clock by my periods. 
KEVIN What are you talking about? 
MARY ANN I can't have children! 
KEVIN Says who? 
MARY ANN The doctor! The other doctor.   I was there today. (beat) Non-specific ovarian failure. 
KEVIN That's ridiculous.

MILTON It's a disappointment. We all have them. Embrace it. Use it. You move on.

MILTON What's to talk? It's your wife, man. And she's very sick.    And that's gotta come first. (beat) Are you telling me the possibility of leaving the case has never crossed your mind? 
KEVIN You know what scares me? I quit the case. She gets better. And I hate her for it. (silence) I don't want to resent her, John. I've got a winner here. I gotta nail this fucker down, do it fast, and put it behind me. Just get it done. Then put all my energy into her.

Packed. JUDGE ARMAND POE presiding. Cullen seated with Kevin and Pam. The jury in their box. And prosecutor FRANK BROYGO on his feet, just wrapping up his opening statement -- 
BROYGO ... And when all that evidence is laid before you, when all these pieces weave together, you will conclude -- you will know -- that Alexander Cullen is guilty of murdering three people in cold blood with malice aforethought. 
Done.   The courtroom is silent.   The jury liked him. 
JUDGE POE Mr. Lomax... (checking his watch) We can break for lunch now, or you can do a stop and start... 
KEVIN If it's a choice, I'll go now. I won't be as long as Mr. Broygo. 
JUDGE POE Proceed. 
KEVIN We just spent our morning listening to Mr. Broygo talk about his 'evidence'. What he neglected to tell you is what this case is really about. He left out the most important fact of all: Alex Cullen was somewhere else when these murders took place. Now, Alex Cullen has done a lot of things I don't like. He's been a terrible husband to all three of his wives. He's been a destructive force in the lives of his step-children. He's cheated the city. His partners. His employees. He's paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in penalties and fines over the years. I don't like those things. I don't expect you to like them. There will be other things during the course of this trial that you will hear about and like even less. But this isn't a popularity contest. It's a murder trial and Alex Cullen hasn't killed anybody.

KEVIN -- Mare! -- Hang on! -- I'm almost there! -- Look at me! 
And she does.   Watching him claw at the wire -- 
MARY ANN I loved you. 
MRS. LOMAX (desperate to finish) -- you wondered yourself -- the apartment, the money, all this attention, everything out of nowhere... (pause) Milton. He's your father. (there it is, out loud) Somehow he found us. Tracked you down. 
KEVIN No. 
MRS. LOMAX What do you mean? 
KEVIN He's always been there. I know that now. Watching. Waiting. He's been playing us like a game. Jerking us around. Destroying Mary Ann... 
Kevin stands.      Quiet fury.   A machine. 
MRS. LOMAX What are you doing? 
KEVIN I gotta go. 
MRS. LOMAX No... let it alone! Stay with me. (panicked) Forget about him! We can leave here. We can go home! We don't ever have to see him again!

MILTON (O.S.) You're right about one thing... I have been watching. Couldn't help myself. Watching, waiting, holding my breath. But I'm no puppeteer, Kevin... 
Milton appears out of nowhere.       Walking past Kevin. 
MILTON ... I don't make things happen. Doesn't work like that. Free will -- it's like butterfly wings -- one touch and it never gets off the ground. I only set the stage. You pull your own strings. 
Kevin has a gun -- Cullen's gun, in his hand -- 
KEVIN What did you do to Mary Ann? 
MILTON A gun?   In here? 
KEVIN What did you do to my wife? 
MILTON On a scale of one to ten, ten being the most depraved acts of sexual theater, one being an average Friday night run-through at the Lomax household, I'd say... (beat) Six. 
Kevin FIRES the GUN -- BANG! BANG! BANG! -- bullets pass right through him -- into the wall -- 
MILTON Whoa... Got me! Damn! (laughing) That's my boy. Step on up! Stay angry! Keep hold to that great fury! Hang on tight, Kevin, because it's the final fig leaf. 
Kevin lowers the gun to his side. 
KEVIN Who are you?

MILTON Never lost a case. Why? Why? Because you're so fucking good? Yes. But why? 
KEVIN Because you're my father. 
MILTON Well, I'm a little more than that. Awful hot in that courtroom, wasn't it? 'What's the game plan, Kevin?' (reporter's voice) 'It was a nice run, Kevin. Had to close out someday.' 
KEVIN Who are you? 
MILTON I have so many names. 
KEVIN Satan. 
MILTON Call me Dad. 
KEVIN Mary Ann, Barzoon, Weaver... 
MILTON Come on. You're not listening. Blaming me for Mary Ann? I hope you're kidding. You could've saved her any time you liked. She only wanted love. But you knew it wouldn't really work out, didn't you? Mary Ann in New York? Face it, you started looking to better- deal her the minute you got here. 
KEVIN That's a lie. 
MILTON Hey, it's not that you didn't care for her, it's just you were a little bit more involved with someone else. Yourself. 
KEVIN What the hell do you know about love?

MILTON Like that's wrong. Like there's anything wrong with that. That there could be laws preventing something so natural. That's our ticket in. (excited now) Did you know there were more students in law school right now than lawyers walking the Earth?

MILTON We're coming out, guns blazing. The two of you -- all of us -- acquittal after acquittal until the stench of it reaches so high into heaven it chokes the whole fucking lot of them! What we cannot legislate we will buy. What we cannot buy we will degrade. We will blow every fuse of enlightenment until it looks like a vandalized, neon sign! And while God is busy at his peephole -- as he deigns us with his disapproval -- as he lumbers around his empty kingdom like some overfed colonial governor -- as God sleeps late, we will win. We've got a winner here, kids! 
KEVIN In the Bible you lose.   You're destined to lose. 
MILTON Consider the source.

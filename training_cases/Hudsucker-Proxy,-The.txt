CUT TO: 
NORVILLE'S BACK 
He walks dejectedly down the street, hands shoved into his pockets. 
A sheet of newspaper eddies INTO FRAME. The wind tosses it this way and that. 
Slap! -- It plasters against another pedestrian, who bats it away. 
The newspaper eddies around some more, then plasters against Norville. 
He peels it off and is about to toss it away but stops, noticing something. 
NEWSPAPER SCRAP 
It is a section of the want ads. One entry is perfectly circled by a coffee stain. 
BACK TO NORVILLE 
He looks up from the paper. There is purpose in his gaze. Wind whips his hair.

CLOSE SHOT - WARING HUDSUCKER 
As the Executive drones on, O.S., Hudsucker is carefully winding his wristwatch. 
EXECUTIVE (O.S.) ...Our nominees and assigns continue to multiply and expand extending our influence regionally, nationally and globally. So, third quarter and year- to-date, we've set a new record for sales... 
Hudsucker looks up from his watch, smiles, runs his palms back over his fringe of hair. 
EXECUTIVE (O.S.) ...new record in gross... 
Hudsucker pulls his sleeve cuffs to expose just the right amount under the suit. 
EXECUTIVE (O.S.) ...new record in pre-tax earnings... 
Hudsucker takes one puff from his cigar and carefully sets it in his ashtray. 
EXECUTIVE (O.S.) ...new record in after-tax profit... 
He deliberately unstraps his wristwatch and looks at its face. 
The sweep second hand is starting the last revolution that will end at precisely noon. 
EXECUTIVE (O.S.) ...and our stock has split twice this year... 
Hudsucker lays the watch carefully on the table. 
EXECUTIVE (O.S.) ...In short... 
Savoring a pause, the Executive looks around the board table. 
EXECUTIVE ...we're loaded. 
This draws an appreciative chuckle from the board. It is cut off by: 
HUDSUCKER Ahem... 
The board turns expectantly to Hudsucker, who sits in the f.g. Beyond him is the length of the board table and the large picture window. He rises to his feet, slowly and deliberately, and rubs his palms together. 
He swings his chair out. 
He steps up onto the chair. 
The board stares. 
He steps up from the chair onto the board table. 
The heads of the board members swing up in unison. 
Hudsucker is FRAMED FROM MID-TORSO DOWN. He shakes the tension loose from each leg, then waggles both arms dangling at his sides, like an athlete preparing for a sprint. 
EXECUTIVE ...Mr. Hudsucker? 
CLOSE ON WANT ADS 
THE CIRCLED AD 
THE FUTURE IS NOW. Start building yours at Hudsucker Industries. Low pay. Long Hours. NO EXPERIENCED NECESSARY. Apply Personnel, 285 Madison Avenue. 
The hand holding the paper DROPS AWAY and we TILT UP, as Norville walks AWAY FROM us into the b.g., towards the office building across the street. Its street number tops its imposing entryway in large gilt letters: 285. 
We continue TILTING UP the length of the skyscraper, to reveal a huge clock capping its facade. Above the clock is the identification "HUDSUCKER INDUSTRIES."  Below the clock is the motto "THE FUTURE IS NOW." 
The huge clock's sweep second hand is just approaching the position that will make the time 12:00 sharp. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
As the second hand hits the twelve, the CLOCK TOLLS, the board room WINDOW SHATTERS and Waring Hudsucker comes flying out. 
HUDSUCKER Aaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh... 
SECRETARIAL AREA 
Somewhere in the Hudsucker Building. A secretary sits typing next to an open window, finished pages sitting stacked beside her. As we hear ANOTHER TOLL of the CLOCK. 
HUDSUCKER ...aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh... 
As Hudsucker shoots past the window, his draft sends the stack of papers wafting this way and that. As the secretary turns to look out the window, FREEZE FRAME (wafting papers have their motion arrested) and SUPER A TITLE. 
TRACKING 
WITH Hudsucker, the building slipping by behind him. As he yells he calmly runs his palms back over his fringe of hair. The CLOCK TOLLS. 
ADDISON A month at the most. 
MUSSBURGER One month to make the blue-chip investment of the century look like a round-trip ticket on the Titanic. 
AN EXECUTIVE We play up the fact that Hud is dead. 
ALL (in unison) Long live the Hud!! 
ANOTHER EXECUTIVE We depress the stock -- 
YET ANOTHER EXECUTIVE -- to the point where we can buy fifty-percent. 
PRECISE EXECUTIVE Fifty-one. 
ELDERLY EXECUTIVE Not counting the mezzanine. 
CAUTIOUS EXECUTIVE It could work. 
OPTIMISTIC EXECUTIVE It should work. 
PRACTICAL EXECUTIVE It would work. 
MUSSBURGER (at ticker tape machine) It's working already. Waring Hudsucker is abstract art on Madison Avenue. All we need now is a new president who will inspire real panic in our stockholders. 
ENTHUSIASTIC EXECUTIVE Yeah, a puppet! 
ANOTHER EXECUTIVE A proxy! 
YET ANOTHER EXECUTIVE A pawn! 
Mussburger strides across the room from the still CHATTERING TICKER TAPE MACHINE and lowers himself into Waring Hudsucker's chair. He takes a last puff from his cigar and slowly exhales a cloud of smoke. 
MUSSBURGER Sure, sure. Some jerk we can really push around. 
CUT TO: 
SWINGING STEEL DOORS 
that read, "MAILROOM." They burst open as Norville, who wears a mail clerk's leather apron, imprinted: HUDSUCKER MAILROOM/The Future is Now. The hellish mailroom is criss- crossed by pipes that emit HISSING jets of STEAM. 
As he wheels a piled-high mail cart down the aisle, Norville is accompanied by an orientation AGENT who bellows at him over the clamor and roar of many men laboring in the bowels of a great corporation. 
AGENT You punch in at 8:30 every morning except you punch in at 7:30 following a business holiday unless it's a Monday and then you punch in at eight o'clock!  You punch in at 7:45 whenever we work extended day and you punch out at the regular time unless you've worked through lunch! 
NORVILLE What's exte -- 
AGENT Punch in late and they dock ya! 
People on either side bellow at Norville and stuff envelopes and packages under his elbows, into his pockets, under his chin, between his clenched teeth, etc. 
FIRST SCREAMER This goes to seven! Mr. Mutuszak! Urgent! 
AGENT Incoming articles, get a voucher! Outgoing articles, provide a voucher! Move any article without a voucher and they dock ya! 
SECOND SCREAMER Take this up to the secretarial pool on three! Right away! Don't break it! 
AGENT Letter size a green voucher! Folder size a yellow voucher! Parcel size a maroon voucher! 
THIRD SCREAMER This one's for Morgatross! Chop chop! 
AGENT Wrong color voucher and they dock ya! Six-seven-eight-seven-zero-four- niner-alpha-slash-six! That is your employee number! It will not be repeated! Without your employee number you cannot cash your paycheck! 
FOURTH SCREAMER This goes up to twenty-seven! If there's no one there bring it down to eighteen! Have 'em sign the waiver! DON'T COME BACK DOWN HERE WITHOUT A SIGNED WAIVER!! 
AGENT Inter-office mail is code 37! INTRA- office mail is 37-dash-3! Outside mail is 3-dash 37! Code it wrong and they dock ya! 
FIFTH SCREAMER I was supposed to have this on twenty- eight ten minutes ago! Cover for me! 
AGENT This has been your orientation! Is there anything you do not understand? Is there anything you understand only partially? If you have not been fully oriented -- if there is something you do not understand in all of its particulars you must file a complaint with personnel! File a faulty complaint... and they dock ya!

NORVILLE 
standing in front of a shelf of cubbyholes. As we FOLLOW his hand drawing an 8 X 10 envelope across the line of alphabetized mail slots. The envelope is addressed to Max Kloppitt, Jr. 
NORVILLE (muttering to himself) ...Bring it down to fif(?)... fifteen... sign the voucher, uh, waiver... cover for Mr. Anatole... he's a swell guy... Morgatross... He was on, uh... 
He is COASTING ACROSS the "K" mail slots, finally COMES TO Max Kloppitt, Sr. His hand moves to the next slot, Max Kloppitt, Jr. This slot is half the size of all the others. The envelope will not fit in. 
He frowns. 
He is about to fold the envelope, but notices something stamped in red on its face. DO NOT FOLD. 
Norville frowns. As he stares at the envelope, we see envelopes swishing across the f.g., whipping one by one in rapid succession, left to right. 
CLOSEUP - ANCIENT SORTER 
An old man sitting at the adjacent shelf, sorting mail. 
Without ever even looking up, with a constant high-speed back and forth flicking of his right hand, he is whisking pieces of mail one by one out of the pile of mail in his left hand. 
ANCIENT SORTER'S SHELF 
As his letters fly furiously but neatly into their mail slots. 
NORVILLE 
He raises his voice over the mailroom din: 
NORVILLE Say, what do you do when the envelope is too big for the slot? 
The ANCIENT SORTER considers this as he continues whisking his mail. 
ANCIENT SORTER Well... if ya fold 'em, they fire ya... 
CLOSEUP - LETTER 
TRACKING ON letter as Hutchinson bears it along. In the b.g., the faces that the letter passes are agog. 
CROSSCUT the approaching blue letter WITH: Norville and the Ancient Sorter. 
BACK TO SCENE 
The Ancient Sorter is leaning over to whisper into Norville's ear. 
ANCIENT SORTER It's a blue letter... top, top level... confidential communication between the brass... usually bad news... they hate blue letters upstairs... Hate 'em! 
Norville gulps. 
HUTCHINSON You! 
Norville looks over his shoulder, but the Ancient Sorter has disappeared. 
HUTCHINSON ...Yeah, you! Barnes! 
As he points, the people around Norville shrink away. 
HUTCHINSON ...You don't look busy! Think you can handle a blue letter? (laughs sadistically) ...This letter was sent down this morning by the big guy himself! 'At's right, Waring Hudsucker! It's addressed to Sid Mussburger! Hudsucker's right-hand man! It's a blue letter! That means you put it right in Mussburger's hand. No secretaries! No receptionists! No colleagues! No excuses! 
DRAMATIC TRACK IN ON Norville. As Hutchinson talks, he thrusts the blue letter into Norville's face. Norville looks at it with terrific apprehension. As Hutchinson's speech ends, we are TIGHT ON Norville's sweating face. 
COMPLEMENTARY TIGHT DUTCH ANGLE ON HUTCHINSON 
We can see the veins in his eyes, the veins in his nose, the hairs in his ears. 
HUTCHINSON Mussburger!! 
CUT TO: 
ELEVATOR DOORS 
ROCKETING OPEN. We MOVE IN ON the young elevator operator who leers INTO CAMERA. He wears a brass-buttoned uniform, white gloves and a pillbox hat. The name BUZZ is stitched onto his breast pocket. 
As Norville enters the elevators: 
BUZZ Hiya, buddy! The name is Buzz, I got the fuzz... 
He lifts his pillbox hat to reveal a white crewcut, then lets the elastic chin strap snap the cap back down onto his head. 
BUZZ ...I make the elevator do what she duzz! 
He holds out his hand but as Norville reaches to shake it he snaps it away and pats down his crewcut: 
BUZZ ...Hang it up to dry. 
He cackles and powers the ELEVATOR into GEAR. Norville's knees buckle under a huge upward surge; Buzz is accustomed to it. 
BUZZ ...What's your pleasure, buddy? 
NORVILLE (regaining his balance) Forty-fourth floor, and it's very -- 
BUZZ Forty-four, the top brass floor say, buddy! What takes fifty years to get up to the top floor and thirty seconds to get down? 
NORVILLE I -- 
BUZZ Waring Hudsucker! Na-ha-ha-ha-ha! Say, buddy! 
With a powerful DOWN-SHIFTING SOUND, Buzz brakes the elevator to a sharp halt. Norville continues upward with the inertia, painfully smacking his head against a corner of the elevator. 
Buzz opens the door and a couple of people enter. 
BUZZ Mr. Kline, up to nine. Mrs. Dell, personnel. Mr. Levin, thirty-seven. 
MR. LEVIN Thirty-six. 
BUZZ Walk down. Ladies and gentlemen, step to the rear; here comes gargantuan Mr. Grier. 
An obese MAN enters, smoking a cigar: 
FAT MAN Buzz. 
Buzz has already thrown the doors shut and sent the elevator into its power-rise. Norville, bracing himself now, sinks only a little under the G-force. 
BUZZ Say, buddy! Who's the most liquid businessman on the street? 
NORVILLE Well, I -- 
BUZZ Waring Hudsucker! Na-ha-ha-ha-ha! Say, buddy! When is the sidewalk fully dressed? When it's 'wearing' Hudsucker! Na-ha-ha-ha! 
He turns to look at Norville. 
BUZZ ...Ya get it, buddy, it's a pun, it's a knee-slapper, it's a play on Jesus, Joseph and Mary, is that a blue letter?! 
All heads in the elevator turn, aghast, to look, and those near Norville shrink away. 
BUZZ ...Cripes a'mighty, whyn't ya tell a guy?! Hold on, folks, we're express to the top floor! 
The ELEVATOR SCREAMS into overdrive and we: 
CUT TO: 
ELEVATOR DOORS 
Sweeping open. Norville staggers out. 
BUZZ (hissing) Good luck, buddy! 
The door sweeps shut. Norville looks nervously around. 
Behind him the elevator doors suddenly open again. 
VOICE (V.O.) Mr. Bumstead is waiting downstairs. 
Mussburger hits the intercom. 
MUSSBURGER Tell him I'll be right there... (looks at Norville) Well, what is it? 
NORVILLE I -- 
But Mussburger is listening to the TINNY VOICE issuing from the PHONE. 
MUSSBURGER You, maybe you're the company's biggest moron. We can't use Morris, he's been with us too long, he's a nice guy, too many friends. Matter of fact, why don't you fire him. No -- scratch that; I'll fire him. (looks up at Norville) ...Make it fast, make it fast. 
NORVILLE You -- 
The INTERCOM SQUAWKS. 
VOICE (V.O.) Mr. Bumstead is getting very -- 
MUSSBURGER I'll be right there. Give him a magazine. (to Norville) ...What're you, a mute? 
The second PHONE on Mussburger's desk RINGS. 
MUSSBURGER ...Yeah, how's the stock doing? ...Bad, huh? Well it's not bad enough. (into the first phone) ...Look, chump, either you find me a grade A ding-dong or you can tender your key to the executive washroom. (into the second phone) And that goes double for you. (into the first phone) Ear-clay? (into both phones) Ood-gay! (slams down both phones, looks at Norville) This better be good. I'm in a bad mood. 
Norville clears his throat. 
NORVILLE Well, sir. I've got something for you from the mailroom, but first if I could just take a minute or so from your very busy time... 
He reaches into his mailroom apron and hands a scrap of paper across the desk to Mussburger, who stares, frozen, at Norville, making no move to take the paper. 
NORVILLE ...to show you a, uh... 
Norville, undaunted, holds up the paper since Mussburger will not take it. Mussburger doesn't even look at it; his eyes are locked on Norville's. Mussburger smolders. 
NORVILLE ...a little something I've been working on for the last two or three years... 
Mussburger's burning eyes finally shift momentarily to look at the crudely drawn circle; he looks back incredulously at Norville. 
NORVILLE ...You know, for kids! Which is perfect for Hudsucker -- not that I claim to be any great genius; like they say, inspiration is 99 percent perspiration, and in my case I'd say it's at least twice that, but I gotta tell ya, Mr. Mussburger, sir, this sweet baby -- 
MUSSBURGER Wait a minute! 
Sudden quiet. 
With one last click the perpetual motion ball bearings abruptly stop. 
As Mussburger's eyes burn in on him, Norville stands mute and paralyzed. 
His eyes locked on Norville's, Mussburger circles the desk. He stands toe-to-toe with Norville. 
He thrusts his face into Norville's, whose head moves reflexively back. Mussburger's nose is almost touching Norville's, his eyes are burning, searching, studying, evaluating. 
Finally he draws his head back. 
MUSSBURGER Hmmm... 
With one hand he thrusts his cigar into Norville's gaping mouth. With his other hand he raises Norville's chin so that his teeth clench it. 
MUSSBURGER Umm-hmm... 
He steps back, eyes still on Norville. 
He jerks his thumb over his shoulder, indicating his chair behind the desk. 
MUSSBURGER Siddown. 
Norville, his lips puckered around the unaccustomed ciger, looks bemusedly from the chair to Mussburger. 
MUSSBURGER ...Go ahead. Try it on. 
Norville obeys, reluctantly, stiffly. 
MUSSBURGER ...Put your feet up. 
Norville is again reluctant. 
MUSSBURGER ...Go ahead. 
Norville obeys. Mussburger studies. 
MUSSBURGER Hmmmm... Let's get to know one another, shall we? 
Norville's eyes squint against the cigar smoke wreathing from between his teeth. Mussburger seems to relax. 
MUSSBURGER ...Let's chat! (beams) ...Man to man! 
Norville beams. 
MUSSBURGER ...You weren't blessed with much... 
He waves vaguely towards his head and searches for a euphemism. 
MUSSBURGER ...education, were you? 
NORVILLE Well, I'm a college graduate -- 
MUSSBURGER All right, but you didn't excel in your studies...? 
NORVILLE Well, I made the dean's list. 
MUSSBURGER (worried) Hmmm. 
Norville sputters out some more cigar smoke. 
NORVILLE At the Muncie College of Business Administration. 
BUMSTEAD, a short, fat, heavily perspiring executive, is screaming at an O.S. secretary. He holds a pot of coffee in one hand and a copy of Boy's Life in the other. 
BUMSTEAD No magazine. No coffee. Mussburger! I wanna see Mussburger! Or did he jump out a window too?! 
In the window behind him we see loose sheets of paper fluttering down. 
CUT TO: 
NORVILLE 
Desperately hanging onto Mussburger by his legs. 
NORVILLE Don't worry, Mr. Mussburger! I gotcha. I gotcha by your pants! 
Mussburger's screaming abruptly stops. 
CLOSEUP - MUSSBURGER'S HORROR-STRICKEN FACE REMEMBERING (THE SCREEN GOES WATERY): 
MUSSBURGER 
is in a basement tailor shop. LUIGI, an old Italian tailor, is just running his tape up Mussburger's inseam. 
LUIGI Meester Moosaburger, I give-a you pants a nice-a dooble stitch. Make 'em strong, and they look-a real sharp. 
MUSSBURGER (barking) No! Single stitch is fine. 
LUIGI (begging) But please-a, Meester Moosaburger, the dooble stitch she last-a forever -- 
MUSSBURGER Why on earth would I need a double stitch? To pad your bill? Single stitch is fine! 
CUT BACK TO: 
CLOSEUP OF PANICKED MUSSBURGER 
MUSSBURGER Damn! 
We hear a LOUD TEARING sound O.S. Mussburger drops a few inches. 
QUICK WIPE TO: 
LUIGI AT HIS SEWING MACHINE 
LUIGI (musing to himself) What the heck. Meester Moosaburger such a nice-a guy, I give him dooble steech-a anyway. Assa some-a strong- a steech-a, you bet! 
BACK TO MUSSBURGER'S PANTS 
The tearing fabric abruptly catches and stops; the rest of the pants hold intact. 
MUSSBURGER 
sighs with relief. 
He looks up. 
NORVILLE 
Norville's arms are wrapped around Mussburger's ankles; the heels of Mussburger's shoes are digging into his face. 
MUSSBURGER 
Looking. Thinking. 
NORVILLE 
Struggling to hold on. 
MUSSBURGER 
Calm. Contemplating. 
MUSSBURGER Hmmm... 
He absently removes a cigar from his breast pocket and sticks it in his mouth. He holds his lighter under the cigar, not noticing that the flame is pointing the wrong way. 
He looks at Norville. 
NORVILLE 
His face drawn with effort, still struggling to hang on. 
A PULL BACK FROM the EXTREME CLOSE SHOT REVEALS, however, that Norville's arms are now wrapped around -- emptiness. 
Mussburger's legs are gone. 
Norville throws his head back and laughs, it seems, insanely -- but CONTINUED PULL BACK REVEALS that Norville is merely pantomiming the adventure for the benefit of the board members, including Mussburger. They stand around Mussburger's office, laughing gaily. All safe now, no harm done. This inaugurates: 
LAUGHING MONTAGE 
Montage silent but for MUSIC. 
A) Norville is entertaining the board with his depiction of the near-disaster. Mussburger is slapping him merrily on the back. 
B) CLOSE SHOT - Board member laughing. 
C) Another board member. Laughing. 
D) Mussburger. Laughing. 
E) Norville laughing. 
F) FREEZE FRAME ON Norville's laughing face.

REPORTER NEXT TO HIM Still waters run deep, chief. 
EDITOR The only thing that runs deep with Parkinson is the holes in his ears. Yes, the Idea Man! What're his hopes and dreams, his desires and aspirations? Does he think all the time or does he set aside a certain portion of the day? How tall is he and what's his shoe size? Where does he sleep and what does he eat for breakfast? Does he put jam on his toast or doesn't he put jam on his toast, and if not why not and since when? 
He thrust his face into that of the Reporter. 
EDITOR ...Well?!! 
No answer. 
EDITOR ...Ahh, you're useless. Yes, Idea Man! Creator! Innovator! Cerebrator! Tycoon!-- 
WOMAN (O.S.) Fake. 
EDITOR Huhh!! 
WOMAN 
Star reporter AMY ARCHER -- attractive, smartly-dressed. 
AMY I tell ya the guy's a phony. 
EDITOR Phony, huh? 
AMY As a three-dollar bill. 
EDITOR Sez who? 
AMY Sez me! Amy Archer. Why is he an Idea Man -- because Hudsucker says he is? What're his ideas? Why won't they let anyone interview him?... 
One Reporter is leaning into another to keep his voice low: 
REPORTER Five bucks says she mentions her Pulitzer. 
OTHER REPORTER Again? You're on. 
AMY (as she picks up the morning paper) ...And just take a look at the mug on this guy -- the jutting eyebrows, the simian forehead, the idiotic grin. Why he has a face only a mother could love -- 
Whack! The Editor has slammed down the cigar box lid again but: Amy, smiling, raises a cigar INTO FRAME having beaten him. 
She tosses it to the Reporter who failed to get one. 
AMY ...On payday! The only story here is how this guy made a monkey out of you, Al. 
EDITOR Yeah, well, monkey or not I'm still editor of this rag. Amy, I thought you were doing that piece on the F.B.I. -- J. Edgar Hoover: When Will He Marry? 
AMY I filed it yesterday. 
EDITOR Well, do a follow-up: Hoover: Hero or Mama's Boy? The rest of you bums get up off your brains and get me that Idea Man story! 
REPORTERS All right, chief... We'll do our best, chief... I'll give it a shot, chief... 
AMY (at the door) Al, he's the bunk.

One of the wagering Reporters grins at the other, who is taking out a five dollar bill. 
The door bursts open and Amy sticks her head in. 
AMY I'll stake my Pulitzer on it!

ELEVATOR DOORS 
Sweeping open to reveal the leering face of Buzz, the elevator gnat. 
BUZZ Say, buddy! Where'd ya get the new duds? 
Norville is entering the elevator in his new executive outfit. 
BUZZ ...and say, buddy! How'd old bucketbutt like his blue letter? Na-ha-ha-ha-ha! Did he bust a gut? Did he die? Did he -- Well, hello, Mr. Mussburger, sir... 
Buzz is instant decorum as Mussburger enters the elevator. 
BUZZ ...How're you this fine morning, sir? 
Norville has been worriedly patting at his pockets since the mention of the blue letter. 
NORVILLE That reminds me, Mr. Mu... uh, Sid. I never did give you that-- 
MUSSBURGER (to Buzz) Lobby. We haven't got all day. 
BUZZ Right away, Mr. Mussburger sir. 
As he talks, Mussburger pats at his suit pocket, takes out a cigar, inspects it. 
MUSSBURGER Well I'm starved. I understand it'll be quite an affair this afternoon, and the executive roast tom turkey at the Bohemian Grove redefines the word superb. 
He puts the cigar in his mouth and Buzz's hand is right there with a lighter. 
BUZZ My pleasure, sir. 
NORVILLE Roast tom turkey. Gee, I'm hungry too -- 
MUSSBURGER Sure, sure... 
The elevator doors open. 
BUZZ It's been a pleasure serving you, Mr. Mussburger. 
Buzz turns to Norville. He is puzzled but trying to hide it: 
BUZZ ...and it's been a pleasure serving you too, uh... buddy. 
VETERAN #2 (O.S.) He don't look wise. 
VETERAN #1 (O.S.) Plan two: Here come the waterworks. 
The woman starts crying. 
VETERAN #2 (O.S.) Yellowstone. 
VETERAN #1 (O.S.) Old Faithful. 
VETERAN #2 (O.S.) Hello, Niagara. 
VETERAN #1 (O.S.) He notices. 
As the woman cries, she accidentally-on-purpose jostles Norville and he finally does indeed notice. 
VETERAN #2 (O.S.) He's concerned. 
The woman mouths words at Norville who reacts sympathetically and waves his hands at the waitress. 
VETERAN #1 (O.S.) She explains her perdicament, and... 
VETERAN #1 & #2 (O.S.) (in unison) ...entuh the light lunch. 
The waitress is entering to set a plate in front of the woman. 
The woman continues to talk to Norville, smiling wanly at him. 
VETERAN #2 (O.S.) She's got other problems, of course... 
VETERAN #1 (O.S.) ...Her mother needs an operation... 
VETERAN #2 (O.S.) ...adenoids. 
VETERAN #1 (O.S.) No, Bennie: Lumbago. 
Veteran #1's enunciation of "lumbago" falls into perfect sync with the woman's moving lips. 
Norville is listening sympathetically, but he suddenly notices his watch. 
VETERAN #1 (O.S.) (alarmed) She's losing him, Bennie. 
Norville is rising to his feet. 
VETERAN #2 (O.S.) Maybe he's wise. 
VETERAN #1 (O.S.) He don't look wise. 
As Norville turns to leave: 
VETERAN #2 (O.S.) How does she pull this out? 
She puts the back of her hand dramatically to her forehead. 
VETERAN #1 (O.S.) (disbelieving) She isn't! 
VETERAN #2 (O.S.) (thrilled) She is! 
And indeed she does: Faint dead away, falling backwards on the stool, so that Norville has no choice but to catch her. 
Norville holds her awkwardly, looking around for help. 
VETERAN #1 (O.S.) She's good, Bennie. 
VETERAN #2 (O.S.) She's damn good, Lou. 
A WAITRESS enters extreme f.g. to BLOCK OUR VIEW of the swooned woman and the embarrassed Norville. The Waitress is FACING the CAMERA and the two O.S. Veterans; the CROPPING gives us only her torso and the steaming pot of coffee she holds. 
WAITRESS (bored, nasal voice) Can I get you boys anything else? 
REVERSE ANGLE 
Back of the Waitress's torso in f.g.; on either side beyond her, the two Veterans are looking up at her O.S. face. They sport extremely bored expressions, topped by "cabbie" caps. 
VETERAN #1 Bromo. 
Beat. 
VETERAN #2 ...Bromo. 
INT. NORVILLE'S OFFICE 
Looking at its frosted-glass door; the sign painter is just finishing lettering in: NORVILLE BARNES, President. 
The sign painter makes way as we see Norville's shadow approaching; even from inside the room we can hear that he is WHEEZING HEAVILY. He is apparently carrying the girl, cradled in his arms. He tries to reach down to get the doorknob; can't manage it; turns to press his back against the door and get the knob with his other hand. 
The door opens as Norville swings around to enter. He is wheezing like a gas pipe about to explode. 
He swings around to kick the door shut. We see that the lettering on the door is now terribly smudged; we also see, in wet ink, on the seat of Norville's pants: senraB ellivroN tnediserP. 
Weakly, still cradled in Norville's arms: 
AMY I'm sorry we had to take the stairs. It was just that horrible little elevator boy... 
NORVILLE Not at all. You're light as a feather. 
AMY (pointing languorously) The couch, please. 
Still wheezing horribly, Norville staggers over to the couch and deposits her gently on it. He straightens up and looks at her. 
NORVILLE'S POV 
She is smiling wanly AT the CAMERA. The entire IMAGE PULSATES as the blood pounds behind Norville's eyeballs. 
We hear the LOUD, RASPING of his BREATH, resonating inside his head. Amy is talking but her voice is barely audible, as if coming from a long way away. 
She throws open the top desk drawer. Inside two lonely lead pencils roll through the otherwise empty drawer. 
Amy expertly flips a cigarette into her mouth and strikes a match off the desktop. 
AMY ...Is it your lunch? The chicken a la king? 
From the washroom: 
NORVILLE (O.S.) No, I -- 
Amy throws open another drawer, empty except for an appointment book. As she hurriedly flips through page after blank page an arctic WIND WHISTLES emptiness. One page only has a notation: 11:45. Address Wilkie Grammar School Junior Achievers Club. 
AMY Is the a la king repeating on you? 
Amy shoves the appointment book back into the drawer. 
NORVILLE (O.S.) ...I'm fine, I... You were saying? 
She mutters: 
AMY Values... watchwords... uh, tender years... (aloud) -- A little town you've probably never heard of... 
She hastily stubs out her cigarette and waves her hand to disperse the smoke. 
AMY ...Muncie, Indiana. 
She scurries back across the room as we hear the FAUCET BEING TURNED OFF: she re-strikes her languid pose on the couch just as the washroom door opens. 
Norville gapes, one hand pressing a dripping rag to his forehead. 
NORVILLE You're from Muncie?! 
AMY Why yes, do you know it? 
Norville starts making pumping motions with his fists and loud syncopated grunting noises. Amy gapes at him. 
He starts singing, off-key: 
NORVILLE 'Fight on fight on dear old Muncie Fight on -- Hoist the gold and blue You'll be tattered, torn and hurtin' Once 'The Munce' is done with you!' 
Amy lamely fakes singing along, coming in louder on the last, obvious rhyme. Norville jumps an octave on it; she quickly follows sit, also pumping her fists. 
As Norville crosses his hands and locks thumbs in front of his nose to make bird wings of his extended fingers: 
NORVILLE ...Goooooooo Eagles! 
Amy awkwardly imitates. 
Norville excitedly sits behind his desk. 
NORVILLE ...A Muncie girl! Talk about the cat's pyjamas! Tell you what, Amy. I'm gonna cancel the rest of my appointments this afternoon and get you a job here at the Hud. 
AMY Oh, no, really, I -- 
NORVILLE Don't bother to thank me, it's the easiest thing in the world. Matter of fact, I know where a vacancy just came up. 
He hits the intercom. 
NORVILLE ...Mail room. 
To Amy: 
NORVILLE ...This'll only take a moment. 
INTERCOM (V.O.) Yeah? 
NORVILLE Good afternoon to ya, this is Norville Barnes -- 
INTERCOM (V.O.) Barnes! Where the hell have you been! And where's my voucher?! 
Norville thumps at his pockets. 
NORVILLE ...Well, I'm not sure where I -- 
INTERCOM (V.O.) I need that voucher! I told you a week ago it was important! 
NORVILLE But look, I'm president of the company now and I -- 
INTERCOM (V.O.) I don't care if you're president of the company! I need that voucher! Now! 
CLICK. The intercom goes dead. 
NORVILLE Oh, of all the foolish... Listen, do you take shorthand? Are you familiar with the mimeograph machine? 
AMY Of course -- I went to the Muncie, uh, Secretarial Polytechnic! 
Norville excitedly smacks a fist into a palm. 
NORVILLE -- A Muncie girl! Can you beat that! 
AMY Well, I just don't know how to thank you, Mr. Barnes -- 
NORVILLE Please! Norville! 
As he reaches to shake: 
NORVILLE ...It's my pleasure! 
She reaches for his hand but Norville snatches it away and, winking at her, hooks thumbs in front of his nose and makes wings of his fingers. 
NORVILLE ...Gooooooo Eagles! 
AMY 
likewise hooks her thumbs in front of her nose, makes wings, and, winking back: 
DISSOLVE THROUGH TO: 
PRESSES 
rolling, churning out great quantities of newsprint. 
Papers piling up one on top of the other, very many, very quickly. 
DELIVERY MAN 
throwing a baled stack of papers off the back of his truck. 
BALED PAPER 
rolling into the f.g. A hand ENTERS FRAME to snip its wires and wipe off the top paper. 
PAPER BOY 
wearing an apron and a little paper boy cap, mouthing "Extra! Extra!" as he holds one of the papers aloft. 
PAN UP his arm TO the newspaper and, BEYOND it, the towering Hudsucker Building. 
All of the above -- 
DISSOLVING WITH: 
NEWSPAPER 
spinning TOWARDS the CAMERA and STOPPING FULL FRAME. 
Its headline, over a picture of Norville smiling, is "IMBECILE HEADS HUDSUCKER." The subheadline: "Not a Brain in his Head." 
ANOTHER ANGLE - NEWSPAPER 
is angrily slammed down to reveal that Norville has been reading the inside. 
His face twisting with fury, he leans forward and hits the intercom. 
NORVILLE Miss Smith, can you come in please to take a letter... 
Muttering to himself: 
NORVILLE ...of all the cockamamie... 
Amy is bustling in holding a steno pad and a pencil. 
As she seats herself in front of his desk, he rises to pace behind it. 
NORVILLE ...Did you happen to see the front page of today's Manhattan Argus? 
AMY Well, I... didn't bother to read the article. I didn't think the picture did you justice. 
NORVILLE The picture was fine! It's what that knuckle-headed dame wrote underneath! Of all the irresponsible... Amy, take this down: Dear Miss Archer. I call you 'Miss' because you seem to have 'missed' the boat completely on this one! How on earth would you know whether I'm an imbecile when you don't even have the guts to come in here and interview me man to man! No, change 'guts' to 'courage.' No, make it 'common decency.' These wild speculations about my intelligence -- 
AMY -- or lack thereof? 
NORVILLE (nodding) -- these preposterous inventions, would be better suited to the pages of Amazing Tales Magazine. If the editors of the Manhattan Argus see fit to publish the rantings of a disordered mind, perhaps they will see fit to publish this letter! But I doubt it. I most seriously doubt it. As I doubt also that you could find a home at Amazing Tales, a periodical which I have enjoyed for many years. Yours sincerely, et cetera. 
He drifts into thought. 
AMY Is that all, Mr. Barnes? 
NORVILLE ...Well, you know me, Amy, at least better than that that dame does. Do you think I'm an imbecile? 
AMY I'm sure I -- 
NORVILLE Go on, tell the truth; I trust you and I put a lot of stock in your opinion. 
AMY Well, I -- 
NORVILLE Oh sure, you're biased -- you're a fellow Muncian. But would an imbecile come up with this? 
He whips the cover sheet off a display pad resting on an easel to reveal a large piece of graph paper with a circle rendered onto it. 
Amy looks, puzzled, from the circle to Norville's proudly beaming face. 
NORVILLE ...I designed it myself and this is just the sweet baby that can put Hudsucker right back on top. 
Amy is bewildered. Norville explains: 
NORVILLE ...You know! For kids! 
AMY ...Why don't I just type this up... 
NORVILLE Aww, naw, Amy, that won't be necessary. I shouldn't send it; she's just doing her job, I guess. 
AMY Well, I don't know; maybe she does deserve it. Maybe she should've come in to face you man to man. 
NORVILLE Well, she probably had a deadline... 
AMY Sure, but -- she could still have gotten your side for the record! 
NORVILLE Well, it's done now -- what's the use of grousing about it. Forget the letter, Amy, I just had to blow off some steam... 
She gets up to leave, and is heading for the door when Norville adds: 
NORVILLE ...She's probably just a little confused. 
Amy turns at the door. 
AMY Confused? 
NORVILLE Yeah, you know, probably one of these fast-talking career gals, thinks she's one of the boys. Probably is one of the boys, if you know what I mean. 
AMY (through clenched teeth) I'm quite sure I don't know what you mean. 
AMY Yeah, yeah. Say, you won't tell anyone about me, will you? 
MOSES I don't tell no one nothin' lessen they ask. Thatches ain't ole Moses' way. 
AMY So if you know everything about Hudsucker, tell me why the Board decided to make Norville Barnes president. 
MOSES Well, that even surprised ole Moses at fust. I didn't think the Board was that smart. 
AMY That smart?! 
MOSES But then I figured it out: they did it 'cause they figured young Norville for an imbecile. Like some othuh people ah know. 
AMY Why on earth would they want a nitwit to be president? 
MOSES 'Cause they's little pigglies! They's tryin' to inspire panic, make that stock git cheap so's they can snitch it all up fo' themselves! But Norville, he's got some tricks up his sleeve, he does... 
He draws a circle with his finger in the air. 
MOSES ...you know, fo' kids? Yeah, he's a smart one, that Norville, heh-heh, he's a caution. Wal, some folks is square, an' some is hip -- 
To punctuate, he gives a little jerk of his hips. 
MOSES ...But I guess you don't really know him any better than that board does, do ya, Miss Archuh? 
AMY Well, maybe I -- 
MOSES An' only some kind a knucklehead thinks she knows things 'bout things she, uh -- when she don't, uh -- How'd that go? 
AMY (bristling) It's hardly the same -- 
MOSES Why you don't even know y'own self -- you ain't exactly the genuine article are you, Miss Archuh? 
AMY Well, in connection with my job, sometimes I have to go undercover as it were -- 
MOSES I don't mean that! Why you pretendin' to be such a hard ol' sourpuss! Ain't never gonna make you happy! Never made Warin' happy. 
AMY (uncomfortably) I'm happy enough. 
MOSES (chuckles) Okay, Miss Archuh. (turns and walks away) ...I got gears to see to. 
AMY (calls after him) I'm plenty happy! 
She is answered only by WHIRRING MACHINERY. 
MOSES 
Elsewhere in the great room, he is hunkered down next to a catchment which he buffs with a greasy rag. Amy's VOICE ECHOES UP: 
AMY (O.S.) ...Hello? 
MOSES (muttering to himself) Them po' young folks. Looks like Norville's in fo' the same kind o' heartache ol' Warin' had. But then, she never axed me 'bout dat... 
As OMINOUS MUSIC SWELLS, we -- 
FADE OUT: 
FADE IN: 
INT. CHIEF'S OFFICE 
He slams down a typescript. 
CHIEF I can't print this! 
AMY Why not, it's all true! The board is using this poor guy! They're depressing the stock so they can buy it cheap! 
CHIEF It's pure speculation! Why, they'd have my butt in a satchel! 
SMITTY (chuckling) Ol' satchel-butt... 
AMY I know they're gonna buy that stock -- 
CHIEF You don't know anything! Fact is they haven't bought it! The stock is cheap, Archer! What're they waiting for? 
AMY I don't know... 
SMITTY Amy's hunches are usually pretty good, Chief. 
CHIEF You don't accuse someone of stock manipulation on a hunch, Ignatz! The readers of the Manhattan Argus aren't interested in sensationalism, gossip and unsupported speculation. Facts, figures -- those are the tools of the newspaper trade! Why it's almost as if you're trying to take the heat off this Barnes numbskull -- like you've gone all soft on him! 
SMITTY Come on, Chief, that's a low blow. Archer's not gonna go goey for a corn-fed idiot. 
CHIEF All right, I was out of line. But you're out of line with this stock swindle story. Gimme some more of that Moron-from-Sheboygan stuff -- 
AMY Muncie. 
CHIEF Whatever. That's what sells newspapers. 
AMY I've got an even hotter story -- The Sap from the City Desk. 
CHIEF Watch it, Archer -- 
AMY It's about a dimwitted editor who -- 
SMITTY Easy, Amy... 
He gives her a companionable goose. 
SMITTY ...Let's grab a highball and calm down. 
She whirls and slaps him. 
AMY Back off -- smoocher! 
Smitty rubs his cheek, staring as she storms off. 
NORVILLE (O.S.) We anticipate, in short order, an upward... 
In rapid fire, Norville straightens up into -- crunch -- Findlandsen, whose head snaps back, eyes rolling, a hand pressed to his nose, drink sloshing; Norville, one hand pressed to the back of his own head and the other wildly waving his hanky for balance, takes a staggering step forward onto the toe of an elegantly-gowned MRS. FINDLANDSEN. 
MRS. FINDLANDSEN Ahhh! 
There is a drum roll and, as the lights dim: 
EMCEE 
grabs the large old-fashioned microphone in front of the band and grins. 
EMCEE Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished members of the Hudsucker board. I give you the king of swing, the rajah of romance, the incredible, the unforgettable Mister Vic... Tenetta! 
Vic Tenetta takes the microphone from the Emcee who backs away, applauding as Tenetta starts to croon. He wears a white dinner jacket. His jet black hair sweeps out over his forehead in a roguishly pompadoured mat; one forelock droops and bounces across his forehead. 
CUT TO: 
SEVERAL BOARD MEMBERS 
Clustered in a dim corner of the room, smoking cigars. 
In the b.g., brilliantly spotlit, Vic Tenetta continues his song. 
As Mussburger joins them: 
EXECUTIVE #1 How's it going, Mr. Mussburger? 
MUSSBURGER Bad. 
EXECUTIVE #2 Good. 
MUSSBURGER But not bad enough. 
EXECUTIVE #3 Too bad. 
MUSSBURGER It could be better, it could be worse. 
ALL THREE EXECUTIVES Hmmmmmm. 
MUSSBURGER The stock's got to drop another five points if we expect to get controlling interest. Norville tells me he's got some hot idea. Can't be good. 
EXECUTIVE #1 Then it can't be bad! 
EXECUTIVE #2 Couldn't be better if it couldn't be worse. 
ALL Hmmmmmm. 
EXT. PENTHOUSE - TERRACE 
where the PARTY NOISE is DISTANT, TENETTA'S SONG just FILTERING OUT. 
We are on a FULL SHOT of the back of a man who stands facing the twinkling cityscape, but in an odd, leanedback posture, with one hand reaching up to his hidden face, his other hand pressed against the small of his back, like a man with a stiff neck tossing back a drink. 
REVERSE 
Amy, having just emerged onto the terrace, squints at him. 
AMY ...Norville? 
He turns and we see that it is indeed Norville, holding a dripping icepack against one eye. 
AMY ...What happened? 
NORVILLE Oh. Nothing, really, just... the more timid investors are no longer running for cover. 
AMY Let me look. 
He does. 
NORVILLE Sid found me the icepack. 
AMY Let me hold it, or you'll have a real shiner. 
NORVILLE Thanks. People seem to be pretty hot over this imbecile story. 
AMY ...I'm sorry. 
NORVILLE Oh, it isn't your fault, Amy. You're the one person who's been standing by me through all this. 
As she rolls the pack gently across his eye: 
AMY Norville... there's something I have to tell you. You see, I'm not really a secretary. 
NORVILLE I know that, Amy. 
AMY ...You do? 
NORVILLE I understand that you're not very skilled yet in the secretarial arts. I'm not that skilled as president. Oh sure, I put up a big front -- (massages his eye) -- not that everyone's buying it. 
AMY I believe in you, Norville -- At least I believe in your... intentions -- 
NORVILLE Oh, I don't blame them, really. I guess I have sort of made a mess of things. These folks have to protect their investment. Most of them are very nice people -- 
AMY Norville, you can't trust people here like you did in Muncie... 
They gaze out at the city. 
AMY ...Certain people are -- 
NORVILLE Didja ever go to the top of old man Larson's feed tower and look out over the town? 
AMY ...Huh? 
NORVILLE You know, on farm route 17. 
The Board is staring. 
ELDERLY EXECUTIVE Yeah but... What is it? 
EXECUTIVE #2 Does it have rules? 
EXECUTIVE #3 Can more than one play? 
EXECUTIVE #4 (to #3) What makes you think it's a game? 
EXECUTIVE #3 Is it a game? 
EXECUTIVE #5 Will it break? 
EXECUTIVE #6 It better break eventually! 
EXECUTIVE #2 Is there an object? 
EXECUTIVE #3 Are you supposed to make it fly off? 
EXECUTIVE #5 Does it come with batteries? 
EXECUTIVE #4 Could we charge extra for them? 
EXECUTIVE #7 Is it safe for toddlers? 
EXECUTIVE #3 How can you tell when you're done? 
EXECUTIVE #2 How do you make it stop? 
EXECUTIVE #1 Is that a girl's model or a boy's? 
EXECUTIVE #3 Can a parent assemble it?? 
EXECUTIVE #7 What if you get tired before it's done? 
EXECUTIVE #6 Is there a larger model for the obese? 
EXECUTIVE #4 Can you do it around your neck? 
ELDERLY EXECUTIVE And finally... what is it? 
NORVILLE You know, for kids! It's... it's ... well, it's... 
MUSSBURGER It's brilliant. 
The Board looks at Mussburger. 
MUSSBURGER ...It's genius. It's just exactly what Hudsucker needs at this juncture. Sure, sure, a blind man could tell you that there's an enormous demand for this, uh... 
He smiles weakly at Norville. 
MUSSBURGER ...Congratulations, kid, you've really outdone yourself. Reinvented the wheel. I'm going to recommend to the Board that we proceed immediately with this, uh... with the, uh... that the dingus be mass-produced with all deliberate speed. Of course, as president of the company the ultimate decision is yours. 
NORVILLE Well... I'm for it... 
As furiously BUSY MUSIC STARTS: 
CUT TO: 
TELETYPE 
Furiously PRINTING out "EXECUTIVE DIRECTIVE #37451-JL7. 
A hand ENTERS FRAME and rips the directive from the teletype, then hurriedly rolls it into a cylinder and slips it into a cylindrical metal capsule. 
The capsule is popped into a pneumatic tube. 
ANGLE - LENGTH OF PNEUMATIC PIPING 
somewhere in the labyrinthine substructure of the Hudsucker Building. We hear a MISSILE furiously HURTLING towards us, inside the pipe, and ROCKETING by. 
ANGLE ON ANOTHER LENGTH OF PIPING 
Once again we hear the CAPSULE APPROACH and ROCKET past. 
BLINDING RED LIGHTS 
as a SIREN BLARES. On a huge board that says HUDSUCKER DESIGN DEPARTMENT, flashing red letters announce: INCOMING DIRECTIVE! 
The pneumatic tube spout shoots out a cylinder, and a hand eagerly picks it up and yanks it OUT OF FRAME. 
A technician in white laboratory smock is reading the directive as several other white-jacketed technicians crowd their heads around his shoulders, also reading. 
All of their eye and head motions synchronize as they eagerly read, devouring the document line by line. 
A large sheet of graph paper is whipped down on top of a drafting table. Under the caption OVERHEAD ANGLE is a perfect circle. Under the caption HORIZONTAL is a horizontal line. Under the caption VERTICAL SIDE ANGLE is a vertical line. 
EXTREME LOW ANGLE - SEVERAL TECHNICIANS 
looking thoughtfully down at the rendering. The head technician is stroking his beard and nodding.

ADVERTISING DEPARTMENT CREATIVE BULLPEN 
The secretary in the f.g. is now reading Anna Karenina. 
The silhouetted ad men, frustrated and hoarse, are still at it. 
AD MAN #1 (O.S.) The Hoopsucker! 
AD MAN #2 (O.S.) The Hudswinger! 
AD MAN #1 (O.S.) The Hoop-dee-doo! 
AD MAN #2 (O.S.) The Hudsucker Hoop! 
The third ad man, slouched motionless at the typewriter up until now, finally raises his head. 
AD MAN #3 (O.S.) Fellas. Fellas! 
AD MAN #1 (O.S.) Ya got somethin'? 
AD MAN #2 (O.S.) Ya got somethin'?! 
AD MAN #3 (O.S.) Fellas! I got somethin'!

PIECE OF ART PAPER 
Printed at the top: Hudsucker Industries Proudly Presents 
PAN DOWN to reveal: THE HULA HOOP 
PAN DOWN to reveal: 
An artist's hand working in fast motion to render the hula hoop logo: A grinning, healthy 1950s boy with a spray of freckles, one fist thrown forward, the other behind, as if doing an athletic frug, a hula hoop spinning with action lines around his waist. 
In seconds the artist has completed the logo and now, also in fast motion, he writes the slogan on either side of the boy: "You know... For Kids!" 
As the page is ripped off the art pad:

GRINDING into motion. 
CUT TO: 
DONUT SPOUT 
As it begins to spit hula hoops in massive numbers. 
The hoops are spit onto a long metal arm where they rest, hanging. 
A bale of hula hoops is loaded into a Hudsucker truck to complete its load. The truck door is slammed shut. 
IRON GRILL 
is thrown up to reveal the display window of a shop just opening for the day. 
In the window is an enormous hula hoop display, with various hoops strung up on wire in front of a large cardboard diorama -- "You know... for Kids!" 
Reflected in the display window we see crowds of people scurrying by, indifferent to the display. Inside the shop we see the proprietor by the cash register, his chin propped glumly in his hands. 
INT. NORVILLE'S OFFICE 
Norville sits anxiously awaiting the verdict of Amy who sits hunched over the ticker-tape machine, studying the emerging tape. Amy finally looks up at Norville and sadly shakes her head. 
BACK TO SHOP WINDOW 
Crowds still scurry indifferently by. The shopkeeper stands idly in his doorway, smoking a cigarette. 
We TRACK IN ON the cardboard display. The displayed price of $1.79 has been crossed out. Underneath it, inked in: "Reduced: 
INT. NORVILLE'S OFFICE 
Norville is nervously pacing. Amy still studies the ticker- tape. Once again she is forced to shake her head sadly. 
BACK TO SHOP'S PRICE DISPLAY 
The old $1.59 is suddenly covered as the hand ENTERS FRAME to slap on a sticker: $1.49. A beat. The hand ENTERS FRAME to slap on a new sticker: $1.29. Then in rapid-fire succession: $0.99. $0.79. $0.49. Two for $0.25. Free with any purchase. 
ALLEY BEHIND SHOP 
where garbage and garbage cans sit waiting for collection: 
Hands appear at the back door of a shop hurling a clutch of hoops towards the trash heap. One errant hoop rolls towards the mouth of the alley. 
The mouth of the alley. The escaped hula hoop emerges and starts rolling down the street. 
HULA HOOP 
It rolls across the street. CARS VIOLENTLY BRAKE to avoid it. 
It rounds a corner and rolls up to a little boy, rolls in a circle around him, and finally wobbles to the pavement. 
The little boy looks at it, steps inside it, raises it to his hips and starts hula hooping. Somewhere a BELL is RINGING. 
INT. NEARBY SCHOOLHOUSE 
Buzz sinks to his knees, weeping. He clutches pathetically at Norville's pants legs. 
BUZZ Aw, please, sir -- this job, it's all I got! 
NORVILLE Get up! 
BUZZ I understand if ya don't like the Buzz-Sucker! Just lemme keep my job, I'm prayin' to ya! 
NORVILLE We don't crawl at Hudsucker Industries! Get out of my office! Leave your uniform in the locker room! 
Buzz stumbles away, still weeping. 
BUZZ I'm sorry, buddy... I'm sorry... 
NORVILLE Buzz... off! Ha-ha-ha-ha! 
As we TRACK IN ON Norville, laughing, there is a low, unearthly RUMBLE, and his face seems to DISSOLVE INTO: 
FLAMES 
We PULL BACK FROM the flame of Sid Mussburger's oversized lighter as he finishes lighting a cigar. 
He is sitting alone in the boardroom, but its door swings open and Norville enters wearing plaid knickers, a little cap, and a knit shirt that shows his waist starting to bulge. He has a full golf bag over his shoulder. 
NORVILLE Sorry I'm late, Sid. That back nine at Riverdale is really murder. 
MUSSBURGER Sure, sure, it's a tough course. Well thanks for coming, kid. I thought the board room would be a swell place to chat undisturbed -- it seems we're having some security problems here at the Hud. 
NORVILLE Ya don't say. 
MUSSBURGER Mm. Ordinarily I wouldn't bother you with it, but -- this is embarrassing, kid -- it seems to concern you directly. 
NORVILLE How's that, Sid? 
MUSSBURGER It's not important in itself -- some elevator boy you fired came to me claiming you'd stolen the idea for the, uh, the hoop dingus from him -- 
NORVILLE Huh?! He -- no, I -- he's just -- maybe I was a little rough on the boy, ya see I -- 
MUSSBURGER Ah forget it, kid, ya don't have to explain to me. He's a little person. He's nothing. Like I say, ordinarily it would just be a nuisance. But it seems -- well, there was a spy in the company... 
He is shoving a file towards Norville, who opens it. 
MUSSBURGER ...Sure, sure, we tried to kill the story. But her newspaper won't play ball... Looks like her story's coming out... 
We TRACK DOWN the length of the board room table TOWARD Norville, who stares horrified at the file. 
MUSSBURGER ...See, kid, the problem the Board'll have... you hired this woman. Kept her on, while she made a chump out of you. Serious error of judgment... I mean, business is war, kid -- ya take no prisoners, ya get no second chances. And a boner like this... I'm afraid when the Board meets, after New Year's, your position... well, it looks like you're finished... stick a fork in ya, you're done... washed up... 
We LOSE Mussburger FROM FRAME as we TIGHTEN FURTHER ON Norville, Mussburger continuing off: 
MUSSBURGER (O.S.) ...I'm sorry, kid. I understand this dolly who betrayed you, she used to be a friend of yours... 
Norville is slowly dragging the golf cap off his head. 
MUSSBURGER (O.S.) ...And this elevator dope used to be a friend, too... 
Norville stares, perfectly still. 
MUSSBURGER (O.S.) ...Well, they've got your throat pretty well slit. And when you're dead, ya stay dead. Ya don't believe me, ask Waring Hudsucker... Yeah, looks like curtains. Well, condolences, kid... 
Norville's IMAGE TURNS TO: 
BLACK-AND-WHITE IMAGE OF NORVILLE 
We PULL BACK to show that it is on the front page of the Manhattan Argus. 
The headline, in screaming nine-point type: 
FAKE! 
Next to the picture of Norville is the subhead: Idea Man a Fraud. 
Next to the sub-subhead is a picture of Buzz in his elevator- operator's pillbox hat: Stole Hoop Idea from Genius Elevator Jockey Clarence "Buzz" Gunderson. 
AMY (O.S.) You can't print that! 
CHIEF He grins wolfishly. 
CHIEF We are printing it! She's hittin' the streets this evening -- 
SWISH PAN TO: 
SMITTY -- and she's dynamite! 
AMY But, Al, it's the bunk! Norville showed me his design for the whatsit the day I met him! Why Buzz couldn't have invented it -- look at the man -- he's an imbecile! 
CHIEF Archer, you're a broken record. Fact is Gunderson did design it -- apparently he's some kind of prodigy -- 
AMY Says who?! 
SMITTY You're not the only one with sources, Amy -- 
CHIEF Smith has a source on the Hud board -- very senior, very hushhush -- 
AMY Yeah, and I'll bet his initials are Sidney J. Mussburger! 
SMITTY You've lost it, Aim. You've gone soft by the looks of it -- soft on the dummy from Dubuque -- 
AMY Muncie! 
CHIEF Whatever! It's no dig on you, Archer, but this story is hot and you're no longer on top of it. Why, it's the scoop of the century -- the other papers won't have the Gunderson dope 'til tomorrow -- The Allemeinischer Zeitung, Le Figaro, they'll be choking on our dust come mornin' -- 
AMY You're fools, both of you! It's obvious they're out to crucify Norville! They're trying to destroy him! 
CHIEF (gently) Amy -- take a break. You've worked hard on this story -- heck, you broke it for us! But it's passed you by and Smith here has taken up the slack. 
BARMAN Martinis are for squares, man. 
Suddenly enraged: 
NORVILLE What'd you call me?! 
He starts awkwardly peeling off his suit coat. 
NORVILLE ...You son of a -- 
AMY (O.S.) Norville! 
NORVILLE Huh?! 
He looks stupidly about, the shoulders of his coat down around his elbows. He sees Amy rushing up. 
NORVILLE ...Oh, it's you! Lookin' for a nitwit to buy your lunch?! 
AMY Oh Norville, I -- 
Norville's attention has already left her. He looks for the missing bartender. 
NORVILLE (swaying) Barman! Set'm up, fella! 
AMY Norville, I'm sorry, I... I tried to tell you... so many times... It's hard to admit when you've been wrong. If you could just... find it in your heart to -- to give me another chance -- 
NORVILLE Hey! Where's that martini?! 
AMY Just give me another chance, Norville -- I can help you fight this thing. I know this last story was a lie! We can prove it! We can -- 
NORVILLE Aww, what's the difference. I'm all washed up... When you're dead, ya stay dead... Hey, fella! 
AMY Well that just about does it! I've seen Norville Barnes, the young man in a big hurry, and I've seen Norville Barnes the self-important heel, but I've never seen Norville Barnes the quitter, and I don't like it! 
She starts pumping her arms, slowly chanting. 
AMY ...Fight on, fight on, dear old Muncie. 
She steps back off the stool. Norville watches her dully, his head swaying. 
AMY ...Fight on, hoist the gold and blue; You'll be tattered, torn and hurtin' Once 'The Munce' is done with you! Goooooo Eagles! 
She looks hopefully for some effect, but after staring at her for a slack-jawed beat Norville can only bring out: 
NORVILLE You lied to me! I can't believe you lied to me! a Muncie girl! 
He lurches off his stool toward the door. Watching him, despair fights with confusion on Amy's face. 
AMY But Norville... I... 
She realizes that, though shattered, he is still the simple innocent she loved -- 
AMY ... Oh, Norville! 
-- and bursts into tears. 
Two loud REVELERS reel INTO FRAME, one of them uncurling a blow-beeper at the weeping Amy. 
REVELER #1 Happy Newby-Newby-New! 
REVELER #2 1959 we dig you the most! 
EXT. ANNE'S 
As Norville exits. It is night, snowing. 
We PAN WITH Norville OFF the bar facade and, ENDING the PAN in the f.g.: 
NEWSPAPER 
WIPES UP INTO FRAME. Next to a picture of Norville is the headline "MUNCIE MENTAL CASE." The subhead: "Hud Chief to Tend Daisies." Sub-subhead: "Headshrinker Calls Him Walking Time Bomb." 
NEWSIE (O.S.) Extra! Extra! New Year's Eve Edition! 
Norville's hand ENTERS FRAME to push the newspaper away and leave us looking up the empty street. Norville's back ENTERS as he stumbles off alone up the street, pulling up his coat collar as he recedes, the NEWSIE's VOICE continuing: 
NEWSIE (O.S.) ...Ring out the old! Ring in the new! 
CLOSE ON NORVILLE 
trudging. VOICES WELL UP, ECHOING. A face looms with each voice, hellishly lit, superimposed over the walking Norville: 
VOICES (V.O.) ...You're not so slow but you're not so swell either and it looks like you're an imbecile after all!... Noooo, I don't guess you will be here long... Sure, sure, but even there they called you dipstick... lamebrain... dope... schmoe... And is this sap from chumpsville?!... imbecile after all... Norville, you let me down... You let Mrs. Eisenhower down... You let the American people down... imbecile after all... imbecile... I predict you're going to lose all the good things your ideas brought you... Please, buddy...! When you're dead, ya stay dead... Sure, sure, the kid's screwy -- it's official... 
This last voice and supered face is Mussburger's. 
Norville DISSOLVES away to leave us ON Sidney in the: 
INT. BOARDROOM 
Hellishly bottom-lit board members sit around the table, conical New Year's hats on their heads. Mussburger, the only one not wearing a cap, waves his cigar as he continues to talk: 
MUSSBURGER ...The barred-window boys are out looking for him now, and we'll see how Wall Street likes the news that the President of Hudsucker Industries is headed for the booby-hatch. Why, when the doc gets through with him he'll need diapers and a dribble cup... 
The board murmurs appreciatively. 
MUSSBURGER ...Let me remind you that our secret post-New Year's party will be held in the office of the President shortly after midnight tonight. Remember, it's strictly stag, so leave the wives at home; we'll be showing some films and, yes, gentlemen, there will be exotic dancers. 
Louder murmuring. One board member leers, a trace of spittle at the corner of his mouth. 
MUSSBURGER Well, if that's all... 
With an unnatural rumble he straightens his papers and we... 
JUMP UP TO: 
Norville reels over to it, stares dumbly. 
STATUE 
Mutely -- mockingly -- dignified. 
NORVILLE 
He staggers off to the elevators. 
MUSSBURGER'S OFFICE 
We are TRACKING ACROSS the office TOWARD Mussburger, his feet up on his desk, laughing demonically, smoking his cigar. CLICK-CLICK-CLICK-CLICK -- the PERPETUAL MOTION BALLS swing on his desk; THRUMMMMM -- the SWEEP SECOND HAND of the clock, illuminated now, casts a moving shadow that rolls across the floor. Evil prevails. 
A piece of paper and a pencil lie on his desk; as we APPROACH WE PAN DOWN and SWING AROUND to read it, LOSING Mussburger but still hearing his LAUGHTER. 
MOVING IN ON THE PAPER: 
Musssucker Industries. Hudberger Industries. Sidsucker Industries. This last alternative has been circled in red. Below it has been scribbled: 
Sidney J. Mussburger, President. 
Evil LAUGHTER. Sweeping shadows. 
CUT TO: 
NORVILLE'S OFFICE DOOR 
We are TRACKING IN TOWARD the back of Aloysius, the sign painter, who is stooped in front of the door. He looks back over his shoulder, leering PAST the CAMERA, to reveal his work: Under PRESIDENT Norville's name has been scraped away, and painted in is SIDNEY J. MUSSBUR... 
NORVILLE 
He pushes past the sign painter. 
INT. OFFICE 
Dark and empty. Norville is peeling off his coat as he staggers over to the closet. 
We can hear DISTANT REVELRY and the STRAINS of "AULD LANG SYNE." 
Norville has pulled his old mailroom apron from the closet and is putting it on: HUDSUCKER MAIL ROOM/The Future Is Now. 
Norville looks at the door. 
THROUGH the glass we see the tail of the last R of "Mussburger" being painted into place. 
Norville throws open the window. 
WIND WHISTLES. 
He climbs out. 
LEDGE 
Norville, back against the wall, looks cautiously down. 
We hear DISTANT CHANTING: 
VOICES (V.O.) Ten... nine... eight... seven... 
HIS POV 
A sickening drop. Receding snowflakes. On the street far, far below, a lone car's headlights cut through the falling snow. 
VOICES (V.O.) Six... five... four... 
WIDER ON NORVILLE 
We are FLOATING IN; it is the SHOT with which the movie began. The sweep second hand of the Hudsucker Clock is approaching the 12 of midnight, the New Year. In sync with the clock the CHANTING continues: 
VOICES (V.O.) Three... two... 
We have COME IN CLOSE ON Norville. A lone tear runs down his cheek. 
VOICES (V.O.) ...One... 
BONG! The toll is right at Norville's ear. Startled, he reaches up to press hands against his ears. Distantly: 
VOICES (V.O.) Happy New Year! 
BONG!! 
He can't stand it. Whimpering, hands to his ears, he edges his way back toward the window. 
HIS POV 
The open window at a steep angle. Someone inside slides it shut. 
BACK TO SCENE 
Norville waves. 
NORVILLE No -- 
BONG!! 
His gesticulation and a shuffle step upset his balance -- he trips -- falls -- catches the ledge -- 
NORVILLE -- No, please! 
He is hanging onto the icy ledge by his fingertips. His feet dangle away. Snow falls. 
HIS POV 
Looking STEEPLY UP. 
HUDSUCKER Anyway. Any particular reason you didn't give him my Blue Letter? I mean, Jesus, Norman, just a dying man's last words and wishes, no big deal. 
NORVILLE Huh? Oh, geez, Mr. Hudsucker, I apologize, there was an awful lot of excitement and I guess I must've mislaid -- 
HUDSUCKER It's sittin' in your apron pocket, right where you left it. Imbecile. 
Norville reaches in and -- pulls out the wrinkled Blue Letter. 
NORVILLE Oh, geez. 
HUDSUCKER Failure to deliver a Blue Letter is grounds for dismissal. 
NORVILLE Geez, I -- 
HUDSUCKER Ah, it's New Year's, I'm not gonna add to your woes. I'm just saying. 
NORVILLE Yessir. 
HUDSUCKER Well, why don't ya read it. 
NORVILLE Sir? 
HUDSUCKER Yeah, go ahead. Might learn somethin'. 
NORVILLE Yes sir... 
He tears open the envelope, reads: 
NORVILLE 'From the desk of Waring Hudsucker. To. Sidney J. Mussburger. Regarding. My demise. Dear Sid. By the time you read this, I will have joined the organization upstairs -- an exciting new beginning. I will retain fond memories of the many years you and I -- 
HUDSUCKER Yeah, yeah, it's the standard resignation boilerplate -- go down to the second paragraph. 
NORVILLE 'Many years, uh... I know that you will be wondering why I have decided to move on, ending my tenure at Hudsucker, and here on Earth. You will be thinking, Why now, when things are going so well? Granted, from the standpoint of our balance sheet and financials, sure, sure, we're doing fine. However, Sid. These things have long since ceased to give me pleasure. I look at myself now and no longer see the idealistic young man who started this company. Now I see only an empty shell whom others call a 'success.' How has this come to pass? When and why did I trade all of my hopes, dreams and aspirations, for the emptiness of power and wealth? What the heck have I done? 
As Norville reads Hudsucker casually examines his fingernails, then pats down a yawn. 
NORVILLE '...Looking back now, Sid, I see that I allowed time and age to corrupt my dreams. Instead of fiercely guarding what was timeless inside of myself, I let the hubbub of earthly commerce erode my character, and dissolve my better self. How is it that some manage to preserve themselves where I have failed? Sidney, I do not know. Perhaps if others love you, you may more securely love yourself -- but I am alone. I loved a woman once, Sid, as you well know -- a beautiful, vibrant lady, an angel who in her wisdom saw fit to choose you instead of I...' 
Norville is interrupted by loud blubbering. He looks up. 
Hudsucker is weeping loudly into a white handkerchief. 
He saws at his nose, gives it a loud honk, and urgently quavers in a voice strangled with emotion: 
HUDSUCKER Skip this part... 
He waves his hankie in get-on-with-it circles. 
HUDSUCKER ...Last paragraph, last paragraph. 
Norville looks down the page. 
NORVILLE '...And so, Sid, the future does not belong to such as I -- nor even you. We have made our compromises with time. The future belongs to the young, who may more energetically wage the battle against corruption. Accordingly, in the spirit of hope, and the ringing in of the new, I hereby bequeath my entire interest in the company, and my seat on the board, to whomever is Hudsucker's most recent employee at the time of my demise. I know this will disappoint you -- you, Sid, who have served so diligently and for so long. But --' 
HUDSUCKER -- tough titty toenails! 
He roars with laughter. 
HUDSUCKER ...That'll show the bastard! 
He merrily wipes his eyes. 
HUDSUCKER ...Yeah, go ahead. 
NORVILLE '...But Sid, let me urge you to work closely with the new president, and to keep giving Hudsucker Industries all your energies -- but not your soul. For while we must strive for success, we must not worship it. Long live the Hud. Waring Hudsucker...' 
Norville gives a musingly appreciative nod. 
HUDSUCKER ...Geez. 
Pleased with himself: 
HUDSUCKER Yup. It's all there. Well, see that it gets delivered in the morning. 
Hudsucker picks up his lyre and heads back up toward the stars. 
HUDSUCKER Sheeel beeee... 
MUSSBURGER'S OFFICE 
Mussburger still sits frozen in his chair. Outside the great arched window Hudsucker rises, through the falling snow, on his way back to the heavens. 
HUDSUCKER ...Ridin' six white horses, She'll be ridin' six white horses She'll be ridin' six white horses When she comes... 
We hear a great WRENCHING SOUND from the GEAR ROOM next door. 
GEAR ROOM 
Moses pries the broom handle loose from the Great Gear. 
With a LOW MOAN the CLOCKWORKS start to shudder and turn -- 
SWEEP SECOND HAND 
Lurching forward -- 
PERPETUAL MOTION BALL 
Swinging down -- 
EXT. PAVEMENT 
As Norville falls the last few feet and lands on his face with one last mighty BONG of the HUDSUCKER CLOCK. 
BOOM DOWN

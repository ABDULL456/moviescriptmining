The cooks sort the living from the dead.

A waiter whispers to him. 
WAITER General Bizimungu wants to see you. 
Paul heads out of the kitchen. 
INT. HOTEL BAR. DAY 
A luxurious lounge/club called the Kigali Club - an African Casablanca, complete with animal heads, a statue of a mountain gorilla, grand piano in the corner. Rwandan Hutu army officers, (distinguished by their crisp khaki uniforms, in the style of the French army), arms dealers, government dignitaries, businessmen and reporters mingle freely. The few tourists stand out. 
PAUL heads to a table. The center of attention and conversation is General BIZIMUNGU, 40's, dressed in a crisp, heavily decorated uniform, a strong figure, relaxed, in control. 
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU Paul, this scotch is exceptional. 
PAUL It's a single malt, Glenmorangie. I thought you'd like it. Anything you need, gentlemen, let me know. 
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU Oh, Paul, talk to the coat check, please. 
Paul heads for the lobby. He's intercepted by an zealous young Tutsi reporter BENEDICT who covers the political scene for the local independent newspaper. 
BENEDICT Paul, Paul, a moment please. 
PAUL Yes, Benedict, what can I do? 
BENEDICT Can you get me into the Ambassador's reception? 
PAUL I'm sorry, it's a private function. 
Benedict takes out his reporters notebook. 
BENEDICT At least tell me who is attending. The newspaper will be grateful. 
Paul laughs.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY 
Paul fixes a floral arrangement as he passes then arrives at the clock room hatch. 
PAUL (to the coat check) Did General Bizimungu bring a briefcase? 
COAT CHECK Yes, sir. 
PAUL Excuse me? 
BIK The Hutu-Tutsi thing. The BBC faxed to say they would be here on the sixth for the peace accords. And the U.N. wants the banquet room for that day, a reception to broadcast the signing ceremony. Can you organize monitors and check the satellite dish? 
PAUL Leave it to me. 
Bik leans slightly closer. 
BIK Also, could you remember to use the service entrance at all times? 
PAUL Of course. 
EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. NIGHT 
Paul hops in his car and tosses a box of Belgium chocolates on the seat next to him. 
EXT. KIGALI STREETS. NIGHT 
Paul speeds through the streets of Kigali HUMMING along to music on the radio and eating chocolates from the box. He passes bicycles laden with produce. The song on the radio ends and local news comes on. 
RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Good Hutus of Rwanda, beware. The dictatorship of the Tutsi cockroach is near. Watch your neighbor. Identify these cockroaches. Then rise up and stamp out this murderous infestation... 
Paul turns the station.    Finds another with music. 
EXT. KIGALI NEIGHBORHOOD. NIGHT 
Lights burn in windows. Kids play soccer in dusty lots. Paul's van turns onto a residential street and slows. He HONKS twice. The metal gate to a walled compound swings open. A GUARD(old, peaked hat, bare feet, pathetic) stands just inside. Paul waves to him and pullsinto the courtyard, two cars are already parked there. 
EXT. PAUL'S HOUSE. NIGHT 
A neat bungalow and gardens behind the high wall. Paul parks and gets out. A DOG runs and greets him, BARKING. 
PAUL Down, Pealiss. 
His wife, TATIANA, a woman of great natural beauty, emerges from the house, beside her an even taller, very elegant woman, she has a doctor's bag and a stethoscope in her hand. This is ODETTE, their family doctor and close friend. 
PAUL (CONT'D) Good evening, Odette, who is sick this time? 
TATIANA I asked Odette to take a look at little Anais. She has a rash. 
PAUL Your brother's here? 
TATIANA Yes, with Fedens and the children. e wants some advice. 
ODETTE Good to see you, Paul. 
Paul embraces Odette warmly, kisses Tatiana. 
ODETTE (CONT'D) I must go, Paul. 
TATIANA You will not stay for dinner. 
ODETTE No thank you, Tatiana. 
PAUL My best to Jean Baptiste. 
EXT: PAUL'S HOUSE. NIGHT 
The old guard opens the gate, Odette drives off. 
EXT. PAUL'S GARDEN. NIGHT 
PAUL (a sigh) Thomas wants advice? 
TATIANA He wants your wisdom. 
PAUL Let's have dinner first. 
TATIANA Of course. 
His brother-in-law THOMAS and sister-in-law FEDENS come out to greet Paul the Patriarch. They hug. Kids run everywhere. Paul spots his twin nieces Anais (in blue) and Carine (in yellow), four years old. He scoops them up, one in each arm. 
PAUL Hello, Anais. She laughs. 
CARINE I am Carine. 
PAUL You are not Anais? 
ANAIS I am Anais. 
PAUL Oh, Carine, that is a shame. I have a present for Anais. 
Anais reaches out her hand. Paul sets them on the ground, takes a chocolate from his chocolate box, deliberately hands it to Carine. Anais jumps up and down. 
ANAIS It is for me. 
PAUL Goodness, I cannot tell. I guess I must find another present. 
He takes a chocolate gives it to Carine, then hands out the   chocolates to his children who are gathered around. 
INT. PAUL'S KITCHEN. DAY 
A crowded family table. Tatiana, Paul's four children, Thomas and Fedens, and the twins Anais and Carine. 
PAUL Roger, your turn. 
Paul's eldest, ROGER, 12, bows his head. 
ROGER For food and clothes, and all that grows, etc, etc. Dear Lord, thank you. 
PAUL Thank you, Roger. 
Food is passed around. Roger gobbles his down. 
PAUL (CONT'D) Why the hurry, Roger? 
He is crying, pleading, like a whipped dog. 
TATIANA (CONT'D) Oh, my God, it's Victor. Why do they want Victor? 
They watch as Victor is beaten to the jeep. At this point Victor looses it completely, stops pleading, grabs on to a soldier, clinging, screaming like a terrified child - like a man who knows he is going to die. It's a horror. 
TATIANA (CONT'D) Do something. 
PAUL What? 
TATIANA Call your friends in the army. Call someone. Victor is harmless. This is a mistake. 
PAUL Please, be quiet. 
Tatiana, moves toward the gate handle. 
TATIANA I'm going to talk to them. 
Paul grabs her. 
PAUL No. 
TATIANA We must do something. 
Paul takes her by the arm, leads her to the house. 
PAUL What would you have us do? Argue with these madmen? We cannot interfere. 
INT. PAUL'S LIVING ROOM. NIGHT 
Thomas and Fedens wait, anxious, as Paul appears. 
PAUL You better stay the night, it is too dangerous to be on the streets.

TATIANA I'll fix a bed. 
INT. PAUL'S BEDROOM. NIGHT 
Paul lies in bed unable to sleep.   The clock reads 3:00 am. 
TATIANA Why didn't you call your contacts in the army? 
PAUL I couldn't help. 
TATIANA You could have asked for a favor. 
PAUL No, I could not. What do you know about favors Tatiana, about barter and deals? All day long I work to please this officer, that diplomat, this tourist. To store up favors so that if there is a time when my family need help I have powerful people I can call upon. Now you would have me waste a precious favor on a stranger. 
TATIANA Victor was not a stranger, he was our neighbor. 
PAUL He was not family. Family is all that matters. Do you think if you or I were being dragged from here, any one of them would lift a finger to help us? 
TATIANA They do not have your connections. 
PAUL Connections? I have no connections, only favors. If I call to help Victor, a General will think "Paul Rusesabagina is a fool. He thinks my favors are so numerous and so insignificant as to waste them on everybody." Then my hard work is doubly squandered. I insult the General and I do not get to use my favor at all. Please leave these things to my good judgment. 
His turn away indicates the discussion is over. 
EXT. HOTEL FRONT GATE. MORNING 
Paul's car rolls up to the hotel's guard house.

The lobby buzzes with activity. At the reception, Gregoire is surrounded by a BBC news crew: GLORIA, young, chic female reporter/producer, and JOCK, tough, experienced Scottish cameraman, and his local sound guy Peter. Gloria is upset. 
GLORIA We reserved five rooms not two 
GREGOIRE I'm sorry, ma'am, but I see only two here in the computer. 
Jock sees Paul. 
JOCK Paul, how the hell are ya'? 
PAUL I am delighted to see you, Mr. Daglish. 
JOCK They moved you from the Diplomat? 
PAUL Promoted. House Manager. 
JOCK Good for you. 
(moves closer) We're having a little trouble, Paul. We booked five rooms, but... 
Paul moves behind the desk. 
PAUL Let me check. 
He punches into the computer. 
PAUL Ah, I see the mistake. You were reading CBC - the Canadian broadcasting people instead of BBC Gregoire. 
Jock gets the code instantly, as Zozo smiles. 
JOCK Zozo! The very man! 
The Scot and Zozo greet, then hurry off.

GENERAL BIZIMUNGU Paul, join us. 
It's General Bizimungu, he is sitting with George Rutagunda now in a shiny blue suit. A bottle of whiskey on the table is almost gone. Bizimungu and Rutagunda watch the peace celebration across the lobby. 
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU Have a drink. 
He pours. George points his glass toward the Europeans. 
GEORGE Look at them, they want to see the tribes dance to their tune. Here is our dance. 
Rutagunda staggers to his feet, launches into a drunken version of the Hutu Militia War Dance. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) Come on, Paul. Show them our dance. 
Paul takes George's arm, does two steps of the dance, then   appears to stumble and shoulder bumps the big man. 
George falls into his chair. 
PAUL Forgive me, George, my step was off. 
Rutagunda bursts out laughing, toasts: 
GEORGE To our president. May he find peace. 
As Paul is forced to join in the toast, Rutagunda laughs, Bizimungu smiles at some insider joke.

CUT TO 
EXT. HOTEL POOL TERRACE. NIGHT 
Drinks are served at a table as Paul listens to Thomas. 
THOMAS My assistant, the Hutu Power man, says we should get out now, that soon it will be very bad. 
Paul stifles his anger. 
PAUL Give me this man's name. 
THOMAS His name is Naramaranga, but please, Paul, even though he is Hutu Power, he is a friend, he likes me. He told me there is a signal. It is "Cut the tall trees." When they hear the signal, the militia are to go to war. 
FEDENS Please, let us take Tatiana with us. You are Hutu, you will be safe. 
PAUL Thomas, Fedens, I am a man who looks after his family. If there were danger I would be the first to leave? 
BANG - a distant explosion, a flash of light on the far side of the city. Fedens jumps. 
FEDENS What was that? 
PAUL Calm yourself, it is fireworks to celebrate the peace. 
THOMAS Please, Paul, tomorrow I will bring you my car. You will sell it for me and get a fair price. We will go to Tanzania until there is real peace. 
ZOZO Excuse me, Paul, you have a call. 
The door knocks.   Paul gets up, angry. 
TATIANA Please, Paul, 'til first light. 
PAUL Dawn. Then they go. 
Paul opens the door, it's Odette, holding the hand of Paul's eldest daughter. 
ODETTE Forgive me, Paul. Danielle says that Roger has gone. 
Tatiana comes over instantly, worried. 
TATIANA Gone where? Tell me, Danielle. Their daughter Danielle answers. 
DANIELLE Next door, mama. He was afraid for his friend Simon. He went to fetch him. 
EXT. UNDERGROWTH. NIGHT 
Roger crawls between the shrubs.      He hears ANGRY VOICES. 
He peers through the long grass.

EXT. PAUL'S GARDEN. NIGHT 
Tatiana rushes out the front door, Paul after her. 
Paul catches her and puts his hand over her mouth. 
PAUL Shhhhh. 
SHOUTS next door. Paul pulls Tatiana behind the car. A beat. More SHOUTS. Paul takes his hand from her mouth. She's sobbing. E 
EXT. NEIGHBOR'S YARD. NIGHT 
Roger crawls to the gap in the shrubs. Feet, a crowd, leaving, through a gate. Engines rev. 
Roger crawls from the bushes. 
Crawls across, the driveway, crawls through a puddle. 
Then stops, SEES SOMETHING, AN (UNSEEN) HORROR! 
EXT. PAUL'S GARDEN. NIGHT 
Paul and Tatiana exit the back of the house with flashlight in hand headed towards the rear gate. 
Paul searches along the chain link fence, finds a section loose, he pulls it back, clambers underneath it. Tatiana clasps her mouth, afraid to utter a cry. 
EXT. UNDERGROWTH. NIGHT Paul crawls through this scrub tunnel. 
Then he hears BRANCHES SNAPPING. He moves toward the sound. Discovers Roger, terrified, thrashing in a tangle of bushes. He grabs Rogers shirt, pulls him as the little boy startles. PAUL Ssshh! Paul drags his son through the chainlink fence, whisks him up in his arms and rushes him to the house. 
INT. PAUL'S KITCHEN. NIGHT 
Paul bursts through the back door and sets Roger down.   Tatiana is beside them. 
TATIANA Roger! 
Paul turns the flashlight on Roger. Tatiana pulls back in horror: Roger is covered in blood. Her SCREAMS, stifled by fear. 
TATIANA (CONT'D) Oh, my God! PAUL Where are you hurt, son? 
oger stares blankly. Odette is beside them now. 
ODETTE Get his clothes off. 
Hands pull and tear his clothes off. Towels wipe him down. Odette looks all over his body with the flashlight. Despite the blood Roger has no injuries. 
PAUL What happened, son? Where did you get this blood? 
But Roger, trembling, just stares, totally traumatized. Children cry. 
ODETTE He's not injured. 
His paralysis freaks the women in the room. Paul turns angrily to them. 
PAUL Leave us, give us some space. 
He ushers the neighbors out of the room, closes the door. 
PAUL (CONT'D) (to Tatiana) The neighbors must go at dawn. 
Tatiana hugs her son. 
EXT. KIGALI. DAWN 
The faintest grey of dawn over the city. Then a flock of birds rises as one in the distance. A millisecond later, the cause of their flight, a grenade explosion, echoes. 
The birds dart, in another direction as the STACCATO of a machine gun rips the air. 
INT. PAUL'S BEDROOM. DAWN 
PAUL sits on the edge of the bed, staring out the window. 
Behind him Tatiana has Roger cradled in her arms, he still trembles wide eyed as she tries to get him to talk. 
TATIANA Will you take a little milk? 
Nothing. 
PAUL Let him sleep. 
The door knocks. The old guard calls in frightened. 
TATIANA No, no, good Captain, you do not have to. We have the car and our van. 
She points to the Mille Collines van. 
he Captain looks doubtful, then his two-way radio barks - an urgent message. He listens. 
Tatiana drags the kids and ushers everyone toward the van. In a second, they are all clambering in. 
CAPTAIN Let's go. 
Paul jumps behind the wheel of the van. Neighbors are jammed in like sardines, 15, more, inside. Tatiana and their kids are squashed together on the front bench. 
The convoy (jeep - van, car - jeep) starts up and turns out into the street. 
The Militia men wave sticks, machetes.

TATIANA has Roger on her lap, she cradles his head. 
EXT. KIGALI STREET. DAY 
The convoy speeds through the deserted streets. Slowing only to maneuver through makeshift roadblocks where Militia wave machetes, nailed clubs and spears as they dance. 
FURTHER ALONG THE ROAD: a group of Militia swarm over a car, smashing the windshield, the windows. Inside a family huddles together in terror, waiting for the windows to give way. 
In the gutter by the side of the road, three dead bodies. 
PAUL (to Tatiana) Don't look. 
EXT. HOTEL DIPLOMAT. DAY 
The convoy pulls up at this older, shabbier hotel. There are other jeeps, and several staff in a panic. The janitor, ROBERT, sees Paul, bursts into waves of joy. 
ROBERT Mr. Paul, sir. Oh, Mr. Paul. We must open every door right now for the government. 
Paul jumps out of the van, hurries to the lead jeep.

He goes to the hotel's big old combination safe, spins the combination a few times, tries the handle, clunk! It doesn't open. He's forgotten the number. 
The soldiers look at him impatiently. Paul improvises. 
PAUL Gentlemen, you'll find some chocolate, and maybe a few beers in the fridge. Don't let them go to waste. 
The soldiers fall over each other to get to the fridge. 
Paul tries the safe numbers again, clunk! It opens. 
He sees: a big bunch of keys, a wad of dollars, Rwandan francs, a check book, and several bottles of the best cognac, whiskey, some Cristal. 
He looks round nervously but the two soldiers are busy fighting over the beer and chocolates in the fridge. 
s they do, Paul, hands trembling, stuffs the wads of notes, into his belt, pulls his shirt over and shuts the safe door. 
PAUL (CONT'D) I've got them. 
He is about to leave. 
SOLDIER 1 Wait!

CAPTAIN Traitor! 
Paul reels from the blow, but manages to stay on his feet. 
The Captain snatches a bunch of ID cards from a soldier, hurls the cards in Paul's face.

Paul rushes in:   The lobby is filled with Tutsi refugees, and scared white tourists.

CAPTAIN You want to buy anymore cockroaches ask for Captain Naramunju. 
The Captain smiles, then jumps in his jeep and speeds off. Paul runs to the van and jumps in. 
INSIDE THE VAN 
Jubilation, in the rear of the van. Odette is in tears. 
ODETTE Thank you, thank you, Paul. 
Paul doesn't reply. Tatiana hugs him. He gives her a look - a mix of relief and anger - the crowd in the back almost cost him his family. 
EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. DAY 
Paul's van arrives. Bik hangs from a minibus. 
BIK (shouts) Paul, I have to go. The staff have fled Kivu Lodge. I have to close it. 
He flings office keys to Paul.

Bik's van takes off. A group of tourists hears Bik's words. 
TOURISTS Hey, hey, we need our passports, we want to get a flight. 
Paul looks at them. 
TOURIST They're in your safety boxes. We need them right away. 
PAUL Come inside. 
INT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY 
At the desk, the same receptionist is overwhelmed. 
TOURIST (O.C.) He's in charge, that's him. 
Paul goes behind the desk. Rumors fly among the crowd of tourists. 
TOURISTS (staccato) to the airport...my embassy ...tried to call... the airport is closed ... refund... this is outrageous ... 
Behind the tourists, Tatiana and the neighbors look lost. 
Paul addresses the frightened Western tourists.

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - DAY 
CLOSE ON: A door with a placard reading "Presidential Suite".   Paul knocks. The door opens. Gregoire answers, half-naked.

GREGOIRE What do you want? 
PAUL Get out of this room and get back to work. 
GREGOIRE I don't have to listen to you anymore. 
PAUL I am in charge now. Get back to work or I'll fire you. 
GREGOIRE Let me ask you Mr. Manager, do you notice a smell of cockroaches? If I were to leave this room, I'm sure I could find this smell. I know people who could cleanse it.(stares) But maybe it doesn't bother you? Why is that? Are used to this smell? Not me, I need a clean room to escape it. 
Gregoire closes the door. Paul's eyes burn with anger, but this battle will have to wait. 
INT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY 
Paul comes into the lobby and discovers Colonel Oliver, he is escorting a tall, well-dressed man, the Tutsi Minister of Finance XAVIER and his family. 
COLONEL OLIVER Paul, you know who this is?

COLONEL OLIVER Get him a room, but tell no one he is here. (to Xavier) Paul will look after you.

Paul sees: UN Colonel Oliver giving an interview to the BBC in front of the hotel. 
EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. DAY 
Paul approaches the BBC reporter Gloria and Colonel Oliver as their interview concludes. 
GLORIA Do we know who fired the missile that killed the president? 
COLONEL OLIVER No. But I fear it's intention may have been to kill the peace accords and spark a civil war between the Hutu Militia and the Tutsi rebels. 
GLORIA We've heard reports of reprisal killings. Will the UN intervene to stop the bloodshed.? 
COLONEL OLIVER Unfortunately we're here as peace-keepers not peace makers, we can't take an aggressive role. 
GLORIA If the UN changes your mandate could you stop the bloodshed? 
COLONEL OLIVER Yes. With some re-inforcements I'm confident we could impose order. 
GLORIA Have you requested re-enforcements? 
COLONEL OLIVER Yes we have. 
GLORIA What was the response? 
COLONEL OLIVER We're awaiting a decision, excuse me. 
Colonel Oliver shakes Gloria's hand then moves off toward Paul. 
COLONEL OLIVER (CONT'D) Paul, I've sent my soldiers to rescue the Lady Prime Minister, she'll need a room. 
PAUL Yes sir, but these people (points) they cannot stay here. I've heard you have a refugee center at the airport Stadium? 
COLONEL OLIVER I'm sorry, I can't possibly take them Paul. I'm overrun with refugees. As soon as we can stabilize the situation we'll take them. 
PAUL moves to the door, where Jock and Gloria argue beside a saloon car with the word `press' spelt out in tape on the wind sreen 
JOCK For fuck's sake, Gloria There's a big news story out there! We need to get out and cover it. 
GLORIA We're not going outside the hotel grounds unless we have an armored car. That's the ground rules. 
JOCK Ground rules! Where the fuck do you think you are, Wimbledon? 
GLORIA We cover the story from here until we can get proper protection. 
She walks off. 
INT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY 
A convoy of Toyota trucks circle on the road outside the gate. Drunken Militia men on the back wave spears, machetes, one, in a woman's disco wig, waves a cordless power drill. The drill bit is red with blood. 
In the next truck, TWO Militia MEN triumphantly taunt the UN soldiers as they hold blue UN helmets high on sticks. The helmets are shot through with holes. 
MILITIAMAN #1 We kill UN. We kill you next. 
ENRAGED UN SOLDIERS cock their weapons, aim. 
A UN armored car races past the Militia and turns into the driveway. The back door opens, UN Colonel Oliver jumps out. 
COLONEL OLIVER Hold the line here. Do not shoot! 
The Colonel stabilizes the situation, his men watch the militia drive by. Paul approaches Oliver 
PAUL What's happening? 
COLONEL OLIVER They murdered my soldiers. Ten Belgians who I sent to get the lady minister. 
PAUL Where is she? 
Oliver shakes his head. He helps Paul clamber into the armored car. 
INT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY 
Paul follows Oliver as he marches through the lobby. Several reporters surround them. 
REPORTERS Is it true about the Belgian soldiers... Are all ten dead? 
Paul watches the UN command disappear into an elevator. 
EXT. HOTEL CORRIDOR. DAY 
Paul is in the corridor, talking to Tatiana. 
PAUL Has Roger spoken yet? 
TATIANA No, Odette says he's in shock. 
PAUL How can we help him. 
TATIANA He needs to be in a safe place. (a beat) Have you heard from Mr. Garindi? 
PAUL Give him time. 
There's a clank of metal. Paul looks and sees: A waiter struggling with a trolley of food by a door. He hurries to help the waiter as Jock opens, indicates quiet, waves Paul and the waiter in. 
INT. HOTEL BBC ROOM. DAY 
The room is set up as a make-shift broadcast center. 
Gloria is on a phone to the BBC in London, she hangs up. 
GLORIA Okay, we're feeding through live now. 
She fixes her outfit, sits straight up in the chair. Behind her two monitors show footage of a plane crash and bodies along roads. 
GLORIA Okay London .... and five four three two one ...That's correct Tom. Today's gruesome ambush of a ten man Belgian patrol has left the UN peacekeeping force in a state of disarray. Its commander has called for re-enforcements. However, the General Council is deeply divided. The United States, still smarting from the UN's disastrous Somalia mission, has indicated that it will veto any moves to reinforce. Meanwhile, the slaughter goes on. Gloria Brooks in Kigali, Rwanda. 
Gloria on the phone, listens. 
GLORIA And, cut ...good, give me a call guys, let me know you've got it. 
Jock turns to Paul. 
JOCK Perfect timing. 
PAUL This goes out live? 
Jock points skyward. 
JOCK Satellite feed. 
GLORIA (ON PHONE) Great. (listens) No kidding,  When will they be here? Excellent. Yes, call then. 
She hangs up. 
GLORIA (CONT'D) The news room has heard that the French and the Belgians are putting together an intervention force. 
PAUL When will they be here? 
GLORIA Very soon. 
PAUL Thank God. 
Jock's is at the window scanning with his camera, getting b roll, then he sees something. 
JOCK Hey Peter, hook me back into the monitors. 
Jock's filming as Peter makes the connection. 
JOCK (CONT'D) Holy shit! Holy shit. 
GLORIA What is it? 
Jock focuses 
On the monitor: blurry focus of a shanty town on a hill. 
NOW FOCUS: Of a crowd hovering close to a group of Rwandan Tutsis seated on the ground. Two Militia emerge from the crowd, waving machetes. They SLASH their way along the line, savage, powerful blows, butchering people like cattle.          (Author note: we will use real news footage of this) 
JOCK (CONT'D) You fucking see that! 
GLORIA (shock) Oh my God! 
On Screen: The crowd run off, waving machetes. 
COLONEL OLIVER (raw cynicism) Congratulations. You should spit in my face. 
PAUL Excuse me, Colonel. COLONEL OLIVER We think you are dirt, less than dirt, worthless. 
PAUL I don't understand. 
COLONEL OLIVER Don't bullshit me, Paul. You're the smartest man here. You have them all eating out of your hand. You'd own this fucking hotel, except for one thing. 
Paul doesn't answer. 
COLONEL OLIVER (CONT'D) You're fucking black! You're not even a nigger, you're African! (downs his drink) They're not staying to stop this thing. They're gonna fly right out of here with their people. 
PAUL (shocked) Their people? 
COLONEL OLIVER They're only taking the whites. 
INT. HOTEL PAUL'S ROOM. DAY 
Paul opens the door. Tatiana and the kids pack bags, prepare to leave. 
PAUL Children, go into the hallway. 
Tatiana and the children stop what they're doing, puzzled. 
PAUL (CONT'D) (to the kids) Please, go. 
The kids leave. 
TATIANA What's wrong? 
Paul takes her hands in his. 
PAUL All the whites are leaving. 
Tatiana's grip tightens. 
PAUL (CONT'D) They are being evacuated. 
TATIANA What about us? 
PAUL We have been abandoned. 
Tatiana clings to hope. 
TATIANA The soldiers will stop the killers. 
Paul looses it. 
PAUL Listen to me woman. I said all the whites are leaving. The French, the Italians, even the Belgian UN soldiers. 
TATIANA But who is left? 
PAUL I don't know. Colonel Oliver says the UN has three hundred soldiers for the whole country. Black soldiers, Pakistanis. 
He looks up at her. 
PAUL (CONT'D) The most the Colonel can spare for the hotel are four men, and they're not allowed to shoot. 
He takes her hand, makes her sit down. 
PAUL (CONT'D) If anything should happen, if the Militia arrive, you must take the children and go to the roof. 
Tatiana's eyes are wide with fear. 
TATIANA What for? 
Paul takes his anger out on Tatiana. 
PAUL Do what I say, woman. You hear me? I will meet you there. 
He storms out. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY 
REVEAL: A chaos of luggage, white tourists, AID agency people, Italian and French soldiers, elite, slick. 
On the edges, clumps of Rwandans, watching, silent, fearful. 
EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. DAY 
A torrential African rain storm soaks everything. Porters with big umbrellas run the white evacuees to the buses. 
French and Italian commanders check off names on clipboards. 
Jock films the evacuees boarding buses. 
INT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY 
At the front desk, Paul, dripping wet from working the convoy,    listens to a French tourist who refuses to pay his bill. 
FRENCH TOURIST Why should I pay to stay in a, in a holocaust? Tell me. 
Paul, stone-faced, polite, destroys this asshole. 
PAUL You are not staying sir, you are leaving. 
EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. DAY 
Paul watches in the rain as the final agency people are being loaded onto buses. 
Several white aid workers weep uncontrollably as they are dragged away from frightened Rwandan coworkers. 
PAUL in the rain. 
Close on Paul's face, as the music plays. 
His eyes open wide, disturbed, music playing 
Paul's POV, an Army lieutenant stands over him, other soldiers around. 
The lieutenant reaches down, pulls the earphones from Paul's ears. 
LIEUTENANT You are the manager? 
PAUL Yes, sir. What is wrong? LIEUTENANT Everyone must leave the hotel now. 
PAUL Why sir? 
LIEUTENANT It's an order. Get everyone out now. 
PAUL I...ah...need some time. Please give us twenty, thirty minutes. People are sleeping. 
The lieutenant is not impressed. 
PAUL (CONT'D) Please, have some cold drinks. I will be as quick as I can. 
'Cold drinks' softens the soldiers' attitudes. 
LIEUTENANT We will be outside, ten minutes. 
The soldiers march off. Paul goes back inside. The kids, sensing the menace, sit still and wide-eyed on the floor. Suddenly Tatiana notices Roger is missing. TATIANA Where's Roger? 
Danielle points to under the bed. 
CLOSE ON: Roger trembling under the bed, as Paul's face appears. 
PAUL Come on son, everything is all right. He slides him out, clutches him in his arms, then turns him over to Tatiana as he phones the front desk. 
PAUL (CONT'D) (on phone) Who is this? Zozo. I know. Get them beer. 
He turns to Tatiana. 
PAUL (CONT'D) Go to the roof now. 
TATIANA (terrified) What for Paul. 
PAUL (forceful) Do as I say. I will be there soon. 
He hurries out. 
INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR. DAY 
Paul's door opens, his head appears round the corner. 
The corridor is empty of soldiers. Now, frightened Tutsis peer out from their rooms. A group of men, among them the politician Xavier, are gathered in the hallway. Paul spots one man holding a pistol. He runs up. 
PAUL (to the man with the pistol) Are you mad? They will gun us all down. 
PISTOL MAN Better to die by the bullet than the machete. 
Paul pulls the gun off him. 
PAUL Wait here, please. 
Paul hands the gun to Xavier, hurries off. 
INT. HOTEL MANAGER'S OFFICE. DAY 
Paul bursts in, sits by the phone and dials. 
PAUL (ON PHONE) Good day, General Bizimungu please. Do you know where he is? Please ask him to call Paul Rusesabagina. It is urgent. 
Phone again. 
A SERIES OF FLASH CUTS: increasingly frantic calls. 
PAUL (CONT'D) Colonel Bagsora. Where? Can you find him? 
ANOTHER CALL: 
PAUL (CONT'D) Who would order such a thing? 
ANOTHER CALL: 
PAUL (CONT'D) Did you find the General? 
Paul hangs up the phone defeated. He looks at his watch. His head flops onto the desk, onto the Sabena logo. He sees it. 
INT. SABENA PRESIDENT'S OFFICE. DAY 
The Sabena president and two VPs sit on couches. 
PRESIDENT If British Airways abandons the route we should bid for it. 
His intercom buzzes, he's annoyed then. 
SECRETARY (ON PHONE) I'm sorry, sir. I have a call from Paul in Kigali. He says it's urgent. 
The president goes to the phone, hits the speaker button. 
PRESIDENT Paul. Are you alright? 
PAUL (O.S.) We have a big problem. The Hutu army have come and ordered us all of us out of the hotel. 
The president is baffled. 
RESIDENT Out? Where are you going? 
PAUL I do not know, sir. I think they will kill us all. 
Paul emerges onto the roof, sees Tatiana, his children, and many of the neighbors sitting huddled together. (They do not know the soldiers have left.) 
Tatiana is frozen to the spot. 
PAUL They have gone. 
Tatiana grabs him. Tears of joy. Paul's neighbors swarm him, touch him, thank him like a messiah. This effects him. He seems genuinely moved as he shakes hands and hugs them. 
ZOZO Sir. The president of Sabena is on the phone for you. 
INT. HOTEL MANAGER'S OFFICE. DAY 
Paul arrives behind the front desk. 
Paul hits the button. 
PAUL They are gone. Thank you, sir. What did you do?

Gotfroid is at his desk. 
SABENA PRESIDENT I managed to get the President of France on the phone. 
PAUL (O.S.) Thank you, sir, you saved our lives. 
SABENA PRESIDENT Paul, I pleaded with the president to go in and get you all. He told me it will not happen. 
PAUL Why? 
SABENA PRESIDENT I can give you many political answers Paul but the truth is that Africa is not worth a single vote to all of them: French, British, Americans. 
Silence. 
SABENA PRESIDENT (CONT'D) You have to get out of there, Paul. I will do whatever I can. 
SMASH CUT TO: 
INT. HOTEL MANAGER'S OFFICE. DAY 
The elite of the Tutsi refugees, those with contacts or friends abroad, are gathered in the office. 
PAUL There will be no rescue, no intervention force. We can only save ourselves. Call any foreigner you know, tell them what will happen to us. Say goodbye but when you say goodbye, say it as though you're reaching through and shaking their hand. Let them know if they let go of that hand, you will die. (silence) We must shame them into sending help. 
The others look stunned. 
PAUL (CONT'D) Get on the phones while we still can. At least we can say they heard our cries. Zozo come with me. 
Paul leaves. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY 
Paul looks around the lobby. It resembles a refugee center more than a five star hotel. 
He turns to a computer, calls up the register, then hits DELETE and erases the register. 
He picks up the phone, calls. 
PAUL Send two of the housekeeping carpenters to the lobby. 
Paul strides across the lobby, calls to Zozo. 
PAUL (CONT'D) Everyone gather together now. Zozo get them all together. 
They herd together quickly. 
PAUL (CONT'D) No one can remain in this lobby any longer. I have rooms available. Who can pay? The rental is six hundred francs per day. 
About fifty percent of the hands go up. 
TUTSI WOMAN I cannot pay? 
PAUL Go with Zozo to the ballroom. We will find you bedding. This is a hotel. No one will be allowed to stay in the lobby. 
The carpenters arrive beside Paul. 
PAUL (CONT'D) Good. I want you to go around and take all the numbers off the doors. 
CARPENTER What shall we put in their place. 
PAUL Nothing. I want no numbers on the doors. 
INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR. DAY 
Paul going door to door, knocking. The rooms are all packed with Tutsi refugees. A door opens. 
PAUL Good day. Here is your bill for the last week. If you cannot pay, or think you will not be able to pay, go to the ballroom. Zozo will take care of you. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR. DAY. 
Paul knocks on a door. The Tutsi politician Xavier opens the door, sees that it is Paul. 
XAVIER Come in Paul. 
INT. HOTEL LUXURY SUITE. DAY 
A beautiful two-bedroom suite. Xavier lives in comfort compared to the other refugees. 
PAUL I'm afraid you will have to move room. 
XAVIER Move? Where to? 
PAUL Our cards, please. 
MILITIAMAN #1 What cards? 
PAUL You have our cards. 
MILITIAMAN #1 No. But I make cards. Would you like me to make you two cards? 
PAUL How much? 
MILITIAMAN #1 One thousand francs. 
Then from out of the fog, three Toyota trucks roar up. George Rutagunda, heavily armed, in cut-off shorts and an open shirt, his barrel chest laden with bandoliers, jumps out. 
he Militia man pulls out the ID cards, hands them back. 
MILITIAMAN #1 (CONT'D) apologetic) joke. 
Rutagunda strides over. 
GEORGE Paul. My old friend. 
Paul climbs out, greets George, as a Militia man swings open the doors of the warehouse. They walk in. 
INT. RUTAGANDA'S WAREHOUSE. DAY 
The warehouse is filled with looted televisions, artwork, cars. George points to the stacks of beer. 
GEORGE Everything is double the price now, you do understand that? 
PAUL I need rice, beans, beer, and your best whiskey.    G 
EORGE Beer yes, but no whiskey. 
PAUL You have no whiskey? 
GEORGE No whiskey, no spirits. Your rich cockroaches at the hotel, they will have to do without their scotch. Anyway, I have bled that cow enough Paul. 
Paul counts out the Rwandan francs. 
PAUL What do you mean George? GEORGE Their money is no good to them. Soon all the Ineysi will be dead. PAUL (incredulous) ) You cannot kill them all. 
GEORGE 
Why not? We are half way there already. 
Paul's stomach heaves. He hides it, turns over the money, gets in the van with Gregoire. George comes to the passenger window. EORGE (CONT'D) Let me give you a tip my friend, our generals in the army say 'do not go near the Mille Collines or they will send the Belgian soldiers back here'. But the generals are about to leave, and we will be in charge. It is time to butcher your cow for the meat. (a beat) You can help us Paul. You have some very important traitors at your hotel. The politician Xavier. The liar Benedict. If we were to get them, then maybe we could let one or two cockroaches get away. You understand, Paul. 
Paul says nothing, but Gregoire has been listening very carefully. 
PAUL Let's go. 
GEORGE Take the river road back. It is clear. 
The van takes off. 
INT. VAN. DAWN 
The fog has gotten thicker. They can barely see a yard ahead. 
PAUL Are you sure this is the river road? 
GREGOIRE I saw the sign. 
The van begins to bump erratically. Bump, bump, bump. 
PAUL Stop. You've driven off the road. You'll put us in the river. 
The van jerks to a halt. 
EXT. RIVER ROAD. DAWN 
Paul clambers out, stumbles, falls. 
And discovers he's looking at the face of a dead child, a young Tutsi girl, her hands clasped on her ears as though to block the sound of her own death - an African Munz's Scream. 
Paul clambers to his feet, sees that the van is on a road littered with dead bodies, men, women, children. 
he bumps were dead bodies, the van has driven over them. 
A breeze from the lake blows the fog clear for thirty feet. 
REVEALING: a carpet of bodies, hundreds of them sprawled all along the road as far as Paul can see. Paul wanders stunned among misshapen corpses, made more ghostly by wisps of fog. 
Finally, Paul clambers shell-shocked back into the van. 
PAUL Go back! Go back! 
Gregoire throws the van into reverse. 
hey bump back over the carpet of bodies, each shake and crunch another horror. 
EXT. HOTEL REAR DELIVERY AREA. DAY 
The van pulls up at the rear suppliers entrance. Paul hops out, turns to Gregoire. 
PAUL Tell no one what you saw, do you understand? 
Gregoire, Zozo and the porters begin unloading the van. 
EXT. HOTEL GARDENS. DAY 
Paul wanders to a bench set back in a manicured grove of bushes. Beyond him a crowd of Rwandan refugee children play in the swimming pool, laughing, jumping, splashing like they were at a municipal pool in Central Park. P 
PAUL watches. Tears stream from his eyes, the stream grows into a flood, he buries his face in his hands. 
Paul whispers to Benedict as he boards. 
INT. TRUCK DAY 
Paul clambers on beside him.   He reaches Tatiana as Benedict sits beside her. 
PAUL I have to stay. 
TATIANA No! Sit down now. 
PAUL I cannot leave these people. I will wait for the twins. 
Paul backs off. Tatiana tries to follow. Benedict grabs her. 
TATIANA Let go. Let me off this truck. 
A commotion as she tries to get up. 
TATIANA (CONT'D) Let me go. Children get off. 
PAUL I will follow on the next plane. Go. 
EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. DAY. 
The truck starts up. Paul runs beside it, shouts to Tatiana. 
PAUL I love you. Keep the children safe. 
TATIANA Paul! 
Then another voice. 
ROGER Papa! Papa! 
The convoy takes off down the driveway. 
Paul, Zozo and other refugees cluster by the door. 
ZOZO looks round, 
I Sees: Gregoire put a phone down. 
INT. UN JEEP. DAY 
UN Colonel Oliver sits next to a UN PAKISTANI DRIVER. he convoy passes looters and small groups of Militia on the road but proceeds unheeded. 
INT. HOTEL PAUL'S ROOM. DAY 
The room is still littered with clothes, kids drawings, the personal junk accumulated over four weeks. 
Paul tries to arrange things, then collapses on the bed, paralysed with doubt - Why did he do this? 
Then the door bangs. 
ZOZO Boss, sir, quick, please, come quick. 
INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR. DAY 
The door springs open, Paul confronts Zozo. 
ZOZO (breathless) Sir, the radio, you must hear, it is on the radio. 
INT. HOTEL KITCHEN. DAY 
Paul and Zozo burst into the kitchen. The cooks and others are clustered, listening to the radio. 
RADIO ANNOUNCER (O.S.) ...Block the roads to the airport! The cockroaches from the Mille Collines are escaping! Xavier. The liar Benedict, the traitor Rusesabagina's cockroaches. Stop them now at Rue Don Bosco. Thirty thousand francs for the head of Xavier! 
PAUL Dear lord, how did they know? 
ZOZO I saw Gregoire make a call, sir? 
PAUL When? 
ZOZO As the trucks go. 
INT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY 
Paul bursts out of the kitchen - enraged. 
Gregoire is at the front desk. Sees Paul - understands instantly. 
Gregoire takes off, running for his life. 
EXT. HOTEL GARDENS. DAY 
Paul chases after him, through the door. 
Gregoire disappears into the thicket of trees. 
Paul after him. 
Through the trees. 
Gregoire, younger, faster, climbs the high wire fence. 
Finally, Paul reaches the fence. 
Sees Gregoire escape into the bushes on the other side of the fence. 
Paul gives up, turns back toward the hotel. 
INT. JEEP TRAVELLING. DAY 
As the UN jeep turns a bend, Colonel Oliver SEES crowds of Interahamwe swarming from beside houses, from gardens. They pull burning tires, old furniture, junk onto the road. 
As he watches several women dip cooking pots into the pool. 
e hurries toward them. 
PAUL What are you doing? 
TUTSI WOMAN P              There is no water from the pipes. 
PAUL heads for the front doors. He's intercepted by the two Rwandan policemen stationed at the gate by Bizimungu. 
GENDARME here is our beer? You promised us beer. 
PAUL Did you explain to the good General that I have temporarily run out of stock? 
GENDARME He said to ask Mitterand and the French to send you more. 
PAUL You will get it in due time. Now, please, get back to the gate. 
INT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY 
Paul enters, sees Zozo. 
PAUL What is this about no water? 
ZOZO It's true, sir, the water has been turned off. 
INT. HOTEL MANAGER'S OFFICE. DAY 
Paul enters. Odette, Benedict watch CNN on the TV. 
PAUL shakes his head in disbelief. 
PAUL We can still get CNN here in hell. 
A state department woman gives a press conference. 
ODETTE The Americans are talking about us. 
ON TV: 
STATE DEPT. OFFICER From the reports we have received from Rwanda it appears that acts of genocide have been committed. 
REPORTER Excuse me, how many acts of genocide does it take to declare this a genocide? 
STATE DEPT. OFFICER I, ahh, there is, ahh we have terminology, that has been. 
BRIT REPORTER You haven't answered the question. How many acts of genocide before your government will declare this a genocide? 
STATE DEPT. OFFICER I'm not prepared to, nor am I able. 
Everyone in the room is dumbfounded. 
Then Benedict begins laughing, a maniacal laugh, then he bangs on his chest, and hoots like a chimpanzee. 
BENEDICT I've got it. I have the answer. Watch. 
They all stare as he begins beating his chest, and hopping about like an ape. 
BENEDICT (CONT'D) We must become mountain gorillas. Then they can put us on the endangered species list. Come on, try it. They think we're halfway there already. 
Benedict hops up onto a desk. 
The door flies open. It's General Bizimungu. 
He surveys the room, then points at Paul. 
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU Come here. 
INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR. DAY. 
Bizimungu looks terrible, an alcoholic suffering D.T.s. 
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU Where are my supplies? 
PAUL I'm sorry, General. The cellar is empty. 
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU You have cockroaches dancing on tables and you tell me the cellar is empty? Did they drink my whiskey? 
PAUL No. We have no way of finding other stock but I have money for you from the guests. 
Paul pulls a bundle of notes, hands them to the General. 
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU Rwandan francs! They are only good now for wiping your ass. There is nothing more I can do for you people. No police. No protection. You're on your own. 
The General storms off. 
INT. LOBBY. DAY 
Paul walks through the lobby. He carries an ash tray to a trash can, the futile task of a dedicated hotel manager on auto-pilot. He sees a UN jeep pull up outside. 
EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. DAY 
Paul meets the UN soldiers, (They are the four Ghanians who guard the gate). They look frightened. 
UN OBSERVER The policemen have gone. What happened? 
PAUL I ran out of whiskey. Please go down and guard us. 
Then ROAR of an engine and the CRASH of splintering wood. 
As a battered Toyota pickup appears, it races up the driveway. The truck drags the wooden gatehouse on a rope behind. 
Crazed Militia pack the bed of the pickup. 
BANG, BANG, BANG. A Militia man fires a pistol into the air. 
PAUL We'll be chopped here. 
The crowd disperses. Colonel Oliver takes Paul aside. 
COLONEL OLIVER A man came to my headquarters, asked that I give you this. 
Colonel   Oliver hands a letter. 
COLONEL OLIVER (CONT'D) Paul, I need you to buy me a day or two. I don't have the fuel for this convoy. I will have to scrounge it. 
PAUL I can't. I have nothing left to bribe with. Can your men at the gate hold out for another day? 
COLONEL OLIVER No, Paul, they're afraid. They've demanded to be moved back to headquarters now. 
PAUL Give me their uniforms. I will put people at the gate, in disguise. 
COLONEL OLIVER I wish I could, Paul. Try to hold out. One more day. 
Colonel Oliver leaves. Their is nothing more Paul can do. 
INT. HOTEL PAUL'S ROOM. NIGHT

PAUL Where are they going? 
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU They can go where they want. They are in charge now.

LOSE ON: Paul: he sees a big problem. The dial is damaged. 
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU Do your work. 
Paul goes to the safe and turns the dials, tries the handle - nothing. It is incredibly hot, and Paul is soaked with nervous perspiration, he takes off his jacket. 
PAUL It might be damaged, General. 
INT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY 
Paul races into the hotel, past frightened refugees who flee. 
Then Paul sees a face he recognizes. 
It's Gregoire with the Militia! Paul ducks into the stairway. 
IN THE STAIRWELL 
He leaps the stairs four at a time. 
He makes it to the third floor, pushing past frightened refugees who race down the stairs. 
ON THE THIRD FLOOR 
He runs straight into a bunch of young Militia. 
MILITIAMEN Rusesabagina. Show us Rusesabagina. 
They shove Paul along the corridor.

PAUL Oh God, please Lord. 
IN THE CORRIDOR 
He careens out of the room. 
And sees Gregoire coming with a group of Militia. 
GREGOIRE That's him. That's Rusesabagina! 
They charge toward Paul. 
Then a roar of gunfire. The ceiling and walls around Gregoire explode. General Bizimungu's men run up with weapons drawn. 
HUTU SOLDIER Get out, or I'll shoot you. 
Paul rushes to the stairs. 
More gunfire echoes (soldiers clearing the Militia). 
AT THE STAIRS - Paul races upward, falls, pushes past others struggling to get down. 
AT THE ROOF - now, there are clumps of refugees who have fled up there, including Xavier who huddles in a corner. 
PAUL Tatiana! Oh God. Have you seen Tatiana? 
Paul runs to the edge of the roof, looks over. 
SEES: bodies -   women, and children, still, on the ground beneath, by a row of hedge. 
PAUL (CONT'D) (screams in agony) TATIANA! 
The bodies move, look up, it's not them. It's refugees hiding. Paul, delirious with fear, runs along the parapet. 
BELOW he sees soldiers herding the Militia. 
He runs back to the stairs.

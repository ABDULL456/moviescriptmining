FADE IN: 
INT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 
A MAN recumbent on the bed, playing a TRUMPET, his white dress shirt defaced by a flower of blood.  The room is ON FIRE all around him. 
He is playing Miles Davis' moody, Spanish-influenced SAETA, a haunting and lonely piece. 
DANNY (V.O.) My name is Tom Van Allen ... (beat) or Danny Flynne ... 
A DUFFLE BAG FULL OF MONEY ON THE BED.  The money burning, tiny flaming pieces floating around the room. 
DANNY (cont'd) ... I don't know anymore. (beat) Maybe I'll let you decide.  Maybe you can help me, friend.  As you can see, I don't have a hell of a lot of time left. 
A PHOTOGRAPH of a woman taped to the inside of a trumpet case. The photo is on fire.  Only her smile remains. 
DANNY (cont'd) Avenging angel ... Judas Iscariot ... Loving husband ... Prodigal Son ... The prince of Denmark ...? 
A GREETING CARD on the floor, a teddy bear and the word, CONGRATULATIONS! on the front.  The wind from the fire blows the card open.  Inside, a BLACKENED BLOOD STAIN. 
DANNY (cont'd) All of these? None of these? You decide, friend.  You decide. Trumpet player? Speed freak? (beat) Speed freak. (beat) That's as good a place as any. (beat) But first, a little background on the mad world of the tweaker .. 
FADE OUT. 
FADE IN. 
INT. LABORATORY - DAY 
EXTREME CLOSE-UP of a glass pipette dripping a clear liquid into a glass beaker. 
DANNY (V.O.) Methedrene was first distilled by a Japanese scientist before WWII. Hand it to the Japanese, they knew a good thing when they saw it. 
INT. JAPANESE ZERO - DAY 
A wide-eyed, jaw-grinding KAMIKAZE PILOT with a death-grip on the controls. 
DANNY (V.O.) This guy's so tweaked, he probably thinks he can survive this without a scratch. 
STOCK BATTLE FOOTAGE - a Japanese Zero crashes into a battleship, bursting into a ball of flames. 
DANNY (V.O.) Maybe not. (beat) By some estimates, 2% of the Japanese population had a meth problem after the war: factory workers, soldiers, pilots.  Maybe that's why it took two bombs to get 'em to surrender.  A nuclear blast is just a minor nuisance to a determined tweaker. 
INT. HOUSE - DAY 
A wide-eyed, June Cleaveresque housewife in a picture-perfect white dress vacuums the floor of a picture-perfect house. 
DANNY (V.O) In the fifties, the housewives got ahold of it.  Dexedrine. Benzedrine. Methedrene ... 
She attacks the same spot over and over again, one hand clutching the vacuum, the other stiffly holding a cigarette. 
DANNY (cont'd) Now that's a classic speed freak for you, skinny and cleaning the house.  I'll bet her poor husband never knew what hit him in the sack either. 
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT 
THE LEG OF THE BED rattling and bouncing loudly off the floor. 
STOCK FOOTAGE - J.F.K. pumping the hand of NIKITA KRUSCHEV. 
DANNY (V.O.) There were even rumors that one of our presidents dabbled with mysterious "energy shots".  Imagine that: a slammer in the White House. 
Kennedy talking animatedly. 
DANNY (cont'd) If it's true, I'll bet ol' Krushchev never got a word in edgewise. 
EXT. TRUCK STOP PARKING LOT - NIGHT 
A sleepy-eyed TRUCKER emerges from his tractor-trailer and approaches a loitering HELL'S ANGELS-type. 
DANNY (V.O.) By the late 60's the government finally cracked down and sent the whole thing underground.  Bikers controlled the market for a while. 
INT.  TRACTOR-TRAILER - NIGHT 
The trucker gripping the wheel with the same death-grip as the Kamikaze. 
DANNY (V.O.) But now anyone with a basic chemistry kit and the right ingredients can cook it up at home. 
INT. PHARMACY - NIGHT 
A CASHIER scanning container after container of COLD MEDICATION. 
DANNY (V.O.) Ever see a long-haired tattooed freak buying up all the cold medicine he can lay his hands on at three in the morning. 
The cashier looks up at the aforementioned FREAK, a frozen grin plastered on his face. 
DANNY (cont'd) Take it from me, he ain't got no cold.  He's a cook.  Look in his kitchen and you'll find a whole grocery list of unsavory ingredients. 
INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT 
TRACK DOWN the kitchen counter on various containers. 
DANNY (V.O.) Drain cleaner, hydrochloric acid, match heads for red phosphorus, ether and of course the cold medicine .. that's for Ephedrene, soon to become Methedrene 
JIMMY Jimmy.  Everyone calls me Jimmy the Finn. 
DANNY Why's that? 
JIMMY My features. They're Finnish. 
DANNY You don't say. 
JIMMY Finland is a country. 
DANNY Well, Jimmy the Finn, let's go score some gack. 
INT. CHEAP MOTEL ROOM - DAY 
Danny and Jimmy standing there looking at something OFF SCREEN.  Danny and Jimmy looking at one another, then back at what they were looking at. 
A GUY sitting on the bed in his underwear, looking down at his left arm and holding a can of BUG SPRAY at the ready in his right hand. 
He is completely motionless, studying his arm with hypnotic intensity. 
JIMMY Bobby? 
BOBBY Shhh. 
Bobby never takes his eyes off his arm. 
BOBBY (cont'd) (whispering) They're coming. 
JIMMY (likewise whispering) What? 
BOBBY The spiders. 
Bobby readies the can of bug spray, his eyes widening. 
BOBBY (cont'd) (sing-song) I'm ready for you this time. 
Bobby lets loose with the spray, dousing his arm. 
BOBBY Aha! Yeah! (super rapid-fire) You thought you could fuck with Bobby, you thought you could fuck with Bobby, you thought you could fuck with Bobby! 
Bobby's mouth wide with stupid joy and continues to cloud the air with bug spray. 
BOBBY (cont'd) With Bobby you thought you could fuck? 
Danny and Jimmy wait silently.  Bobby finally stops spraying, satisfied he has killed the imaginary spiders. 
He looks up at Jimmy and Danny, his eyes swimming with stupid, drug- addled confusion. 
BOBBY (cont'd) Who the fuck are you? 
JIMMY It's me ... Jimmy 
Bobby squints. 
BOBBY Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy. Rhymes with Simmy. 
JIMMY Yeah. 
BOBBY What can I do for you? 
JIMMY Um, coupla' eight balls oughta do us. 
Danny and Jimmy notice something simultaneously. 
There is something under the mattress - A HUGE BULGE. 
BOBBY Don't pay her no mind. 
A MUFFLED MOAN from under Bobby.  She is between the mattress and the box springs. 
BOBBY (cont'd) Shut the hell up, goddamit! 
Bobby starts slapping the top of the mattress with his hand.  New MUFFLED SCREAMS from underneath. 
BOBBY (cont'd) I got no vocation skills!  What the fuck you want from me? (keeps slapping) I got no vocation skills! 
JIMMY Hey man, take it easy. 
Bobby immediately stops.  Looks at Jimmy with incredulity. 
BOBBY What? 
JIMMY Come on.  Ease off the girl. 
Bobby springs from the bed, grabbing something as he rises. 
Danny and Jimmy suddenly staring at a SPEARGUN which is loaded with two stainless steel spears. 
Bobby stands there alternately pointing the speargun at Jimmy, then Danny. 
BOBBY Did you bring the plastic men? 
Bobby nods towards something behind Danny.  Danny and Jimmy don't move or speak. 
BOBBY (cont'd) Did you bring the plastic men? (beat) Did you bring the plastic men? 
Bobby rubs his nose. 
BOBBY Did ... you ... bring ... the ... plastic ... men? 
DANNY Never mind.  Dude had a backfull of jailhouse tatts. 
QUICK FLASHES OF BOBBY'S TATTOOS. 
TANNER No last name? 
DANNY It was all pretty informal.  Didn't have a lot of time to exchange pleasantries. 
Garcetti produces something from the front seat of the car and trudges over. 
GARCETTI This the guy? 
DANNY It speaks! 
The humorless Garcetti hands Danny a "WANTED POSTER".  Bobby's mug shot glaring. 
DANNY That's him.  He's a lot prettier in person though. 
GARCETTI Cut to the fucking chase, Flynne. 
DANNY Dude is bugging.  Transparent spiders, plastic men - the whole nine yards. 
GARCETTI What's he holding? 
FLASHBACK - INT. CHEAP MOTEL ROOM - DAY 
Bobby's hand extracting the eightballs from a nylon bag full of meth. 
DANNY (O.S.) Couple of eightballs, maybe more. 
QUICK SHOT of an open drawer.  A GUN can be glimpsed inside. 
DANNY (cont'd) Cheap ass techno knockoff in the drawer with extra mags. 
ANOTHER QUICK GLIMPSE of the closet.  A shotgun butt visable 
DANNY (cont'd) 12 gauge in the closet. 
TANNER (O.S.) Any company? 
The WOMAN'S HAND protruding from underneath the mattress. 
DANNY (O.S.) Alas, the lovely Mrs. Bobby was playing the bologna in a Posturpedic sandwich (beat) And there was a kid. 
A SILHOUETTE visible through a crack in the BATHROOM DOOR. 
TANNER (O.S.) A kid?  Are you sure? 
A BEAT-UP ELMO DOLL and SOME COLORING BOOKS on top of the dresser. 
EXT. PARK - NIGHT 
Back on Danny. DANNY Yeah. Pretty sure. (beat) Oh yeah ... he had a spear gun, too. 
TANNER God damn, Flynne, you are one observant tweaker. 
DANNY Somebody has to help you lazy bastards. 
Garcetti looks at Danny with contempt.  They head back to the car. 
DANNY (cont'd) Hey Tanner ... you be careful, okay? 
TANNER Danny, I'm touched. 
DANNY Don't be. I'm worried about the kid. 
GARCETTI Then why didn't you help the kid when you were there? 
DANNY Hey, you want me to do all your work for you, numbnuts? 
Garcetti throws Danny up against the car.  Nose-to-nose. 
GARCETTI I'll tell you why you didn't help - because you're a chickenshit tweaking snitch.  You're a bottom feader, Flynne. 
DANNY Garcetti, you're teeth, they're fucking perfect. 
Garcetti lets Danny go. Stomps off. 
DANNY You're welcome. 
EXT. CHEAP MOTEL ROOM - DAY 
A GAGGLE OF ONLOOKERS, including a NEWS CREW, watching from the parking lot. 
BOBBY'S WOMAN screaming at the top of her lungs as she tries to get a Bobby's sheet-covered body. 
A SWAT TEAM packing up nearby.  One of them suddenly does a graceful little Tai-Chi gesture. 
A LITTLE GIRL clutches at the screaming woman's legs. 
REVEAL DANNY, amongst the onlookers.  His expression gives nothing away. 
A ribbon of blood snakes from Bobby's body, over the parking lot curb and runs into a storm drain. 
As the blood SPLATTERS to the bottom, mixing with a pool of filthy water. THE SOUND IS UNNATURALLY LOUD. 
INT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL - GARDENA - NIGHT. 
The place cries out "YOU HAVE FINALLY HIT THE ABSOLUTE BOTTOM!" 
LIZ That's so ... (not finishing the word) 
DANNY / TOM Melancholy? 
LIZ Yes, it hurts my heart.  What a beautiful composition. 
DANNY/TOM And the performance? 
LIZ (goofing) A virtuoso rendition.  TOM VAN ALLEN is nothing short of dazzling in his interpretation of Miles Davis' haunting, moody piece. 
DANNY/TOM Thank you.  Thank you very much. 
LIZ And he has a really hot ass with hardly any hair on it. 
DANNY/TOM Again, I thank you. 
LIZ I was talking about Miles. 
Danny playfully tackles her to the ground. 
DANNY/TOM You, madam, are a heartless wench. 
LIZ And you've got wiener breath. 
DANNY/TOM Really? 
LIZ It's that disgusting hot dog you had for lunch. 
Danny starts kissing her over and over again. 
LIZ (laughing) Tom! Gross! 
She finally pushes him off.  He rolls off of her and snuggles up next to her, spooning her in the sand. 
DANNY/TOM You know how I make that song melancholy when I play it? I think of what my life would be like without you. 
Liz smiles, snuggles closer to Danny. 
LIZ Tom, let's spend the night here. 
DANNY/TOM There's no motels around here. 
LIZ No.  Right here on the beach.  Come on. Let's do it. 
INT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 
Danny sitting at the vanity holding the trumpet.  THE IMAGE IS STILL PROJECTED ON THE WALL BEHIND HIM. DANNY (at the vanity, whispering) Okay, we'll stay.  We'll stay. 
NOW THE DANNY IN THE IMAGE ANSWERS .... 
DANNY/TOM (on the beach) Come on, Liz. We'll get eaten alive. 
DANNY (at the vanity, softly) No ... We'll stay. 
BACK ON THE IMAGE as Danny and Liz walk away from the shore. 
The sun sinks completely below the horizon. 
A long fish hawk floats on the last of the thermals. 
The dying fish breaths its last. 
Danny (at the vanity) closes his eyes. 
SERIES OF QUICK CUTS 
The trumpet goes back in the case. 
The lid is closed. 
The case goes back in the box. 
The neatly folded clothes are laid on top. 
The box goes back to the shelf. 
The light in the closet is turned off. 
FADE OUT. 
FADE IN. 
EXT. DESERTED PARK - NIGHT 
Danny and Tanner sitting across from one another at a picnic table. 
Tanner writing serial numbers down as he counts out SEVERAL HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS. 
Danny watching silently. 
Tanner puts the bills in an envelope, licks the flap, seals it and slides it over to Danny, who doesn't touch it. 
The envelope lays there between them for the following conversation. 
DANNY You think I'm a Judas? 
TANNER Hard to compare the people you're taking down with the Lord. 
DANNY Garcetti thinks I'm a pile of shit. 
EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT 
Danny sitting cross-legged in front of a gravestone. 
A PICKUP TRUCK slowly winds its way up the access road towards Danny. 
Danny stands up.  Dusts his pants off. 
The truck stops nearby.  The strains of GARTH BROOKS from inside. 
Danny approaches.  The passenger's side window rolls down revealing ... 
... A BAD-ASSED ASIAN DUDE behind the wheel. He wears a cowboy hat and a rodeo belt.  He looks like the Chinese Marlboro man.  This is BUBBA. 
An AIRBRUSH painting on the door panel - a bad likeness of Bubba astride a horse, dressed as a cowboy with a huge-breasted Pamela Anderson-type on the saddle behind him. 
DANNY (checking out the painting) Ride 'em cowboy) 
BUBBA (southern twang) You like that? 
DANNY Who wouldn't? 
BUBBA First rate, ain't it? 
DANNY It's downright classy is what it is. 
Bubba fires up a cigarette, revealing a pock-marked face. He carries a gun in a tooled leather shoulder holster. DANNY (cont'd) You consider my presentation? 
BUBBA Get in, hoss.  We'll talk it over. 
Danny climbs in.  The window goes back up.  As the care pulls away, we 
... MOVE back over to the gravestone. 
The stone reads: "ELIZABETH VAN ALLEN.  BELOVED WIFE" 
EXT. THE CINDER BLOCK BAR - NIGHT 
A non-descript. cinder block bar.  No windows.  No frills. 
INT. CINDER BLOCK BAR - SAME 
Danny sitting at the bar, nursing a drink.  He looks nervous, eyes darting around for potential assassins. 
He has nothing to worry about with this crowd, harmless alcoholics all. 
Jimmy The Finn enters and approaches Danny.  Danny signals for Jimmy to go to the back, then gets up and follows him, carrying two beers. 
DANNY Jimmy, you don't look so hot. 
Jimmy has dark circles under his eyes. 
JIMMY I'm hurting. 
DANNY You on a roll? 
JIMMY Was.  I'm on the fucking ghost train right now, man.  You got anything for me? 
DANNY Sorry. 
JIMMY Why does it have to feel so bad? 
DANNY You're brain is in reverse mode ... cutting off your supply of dopamine. Here.  Have a beer. 
Jimmy sighs, scratches his arms.  They are all scabbed up. 
DANNY (cont'd) You see the crank bugs? 
JIMMY Oh yeah. (guzzles some beer) Man, Danny, how do you keep your shit together so tight? 
Danny chuckles. DANNY That's a good one. 
JIMMY I'm serious, dude.  You always seem to be on top of things, even when you're tweakin'. 
DANNY I guess there's just no substitute for good genes. 
Jimmy finishes his beer.  Danny signals to the cocktail waitress for more beer. 
DANNY (cont'd) You hear about Bobby? 
JIMMY Yeah, it's a pity.  Truly a pity. 
Danny smiles at Jimmy's choice of words. 
JIMMY (cont'd) He was a good supplier. (gets an idea) You think maybe there's any drugs left in his room?  You know, like hidden? 
DANNY I kind of doubt it, Jimmy. 
The beers arrive.  Jimmy lays into his, downing it in one long gulp. Danny slides his over. 
JIMMY So, why'd you want to see me? 
DANNY Business.  I need to leave town and I find myself in dire need of some cash. 
JIMMY See that?  That's just what I'm talking about. 
DANNY What? 
JIMMY You. You're smooth. You use words like dire and shit.  You got language skills, man. 
JIMMY You wanna score some go-fast? 
DANNY Not tonight. 
They continue on. Jimmy looks at the vest. 
JIMMY Hey, why do you need a gun and a vest anyway? 
DANNY Personal protection. It's a dangerous world we live in, Jimmy, a very dangerous world. 
INT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL - NIGHT 
A TRASHY LOOKING DUDE banging on Colette's door. 
Danny at his door, fumbling with his keys, watching the dude. 
DUDE (sees Danny eyeballing him) You mad dogging me, Bitch? 
DANNY Heavens no. I was just admiring your boots. 
The dude looks down at this beat-up motorcycle boots. 
DANNY Did you purchase them locally? 
The dude ignores Danny and keeps pounding on the door. 
DANNY (cont'd) Goodbye now. Nice meeting you. 
INT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 
Danny enters.  AN ARGUMENT ENSUES NEXT DOOR between the dude and Colette. 
The sounds of a struggle.  Colette screams.  The dude yelling at the top of his lungs.  A LOUD SMACK. SILENCE. 
Colette sobbing. The dude talking in hushed tones, contrite. 
EXT. FREEWAY - DAY 
A spray painted rusty Chevy Vega belching black smoke.  All of the lights are broken. 
INT. VERA - SAME 
Jimmy driving.  Danny in the passenger's seat, looking down at ... 
... the floorboard, or lack thereof.  It is completely rusted out.  The freeway rushes by underneath. 
DANNY You know, Jimmy, you might as well put a sign on the back of this thing asking the cops to pull you over. 
JIMMY You mean, like to throw 'em off? 
DANNY Yeah, that's what I mean. (beat) Where the hell does this guy live anyway? 
JIMMY Palmdale 
DANNY Why do they call him Pooh-Bear? 
JIMMY I think on account of his nose. 
DANNY You're going to have to explain that one. 
JIMMY He doesn't have one. 
DANNY You're going to have to give me a little more than that, Jimmy. 
JIMMY Well, you know how Winnie the Pooh always got his nose stuck in the honey jar? Well, Pooh-Bear snorted so much crank, they had to cut his nose off. He's got a plastic one though. 
Danny wonders what he's getting himself into. 
JIMMY (cont'd) You know, they say he hasn't slept in over a year. 
DANNY You ever see Queen Elizabeth sleep? 
JIMMY No (beat) You think she's a tweaker? 
EXT. POOH-BEAR'S COMPOUND - DAY 
A sprawling old ranch house tucked into the remote hills of the desert. 
A GUY passes out in the front yard.  A DOG sniffs at him, then starts pissing on him.  He never moves. 
A PILE OF DEAD PIGEONS near the driveway. 
CLOSE ON POOH-BEAR - he does indeed have a prosthetic nose.  It almost blends in with his face but not quite, making it that much more disconcerting. 
He takes a huge hit of crystal meth from a pipe, holds it, then blows a long exhale. 
POOH-BEAR Okay, here we go gentlemen ... 
A REMOTE CONTROLLED CAR trundles out of the garage and along the driveway. Inside the car, FOUR PIEGEONS, their bodies wrapped in tape. 
Pooh-Bear working the remote control device. 
POOH-BEAR (cont'd) Zapruder? 
A GUY filming the whole thing with a super-8 camera. 
GRAINY SUPER 8 FOOTAGE: the pigeons continue along, their stupid eyes glazed with confusion. 
ZAPRUDER Ready. 
DANNY But I just met you. 
POOH-BEAR But you're a friend of Jimmy's. I think of you as a brother already. 
Pooh-Bear takes another bite of eggs. 
DANNY So that's 40 lbs. at 6 a pound then? 
POOH-BEAR If you say so. 
DANNY Pooh-Bear, I don't mean to be rude, but I get the feeling you aren't taking me seriously. 
Pooh-Bear puts the plate down. 
POOH-BEAR Maybe you're the one who isn't taking me seriously. 
DANNY Why do you say that? 
POOH-BEAR I welcome you here with open arms and you got the nerve to low-ball me like some slick used car salesman. 
DANNY Hey, I was just trying to ... 
POOH-BEAR (never losing his smile) I want to tell you about the last guy who tried to jam me up on a deal. 
DANNY Hey, I don't play that. 
POOH-BEAR I'm sure you don't.  At least I'm sure you think you don't.  Anyway, I want to tell you. It's a good story, guaranteed to break the ice at a party. 
Pooh-Bear leans back, grinning broadly 
POOH-BEAR (cont'd) Dude shorted me eleven dollar ... thought I wouldn't count it till I got home.  Wrong. (beat) You know what I did? (beat) I clamped his head in a vice. 
QUICK FLASH BACK: LOW ANGLE SLOW-MOTION CLOSE-UP of Pooh-Bear staring down at something OFFSCREEN, a menacing look on his face. 
POOH-BEAR (V.O.) You should have heard him howling. 
BACK TO PRESENT: Pooh-Bear lights a cigarette 
POOH-BEAR Then I took a Saws All and I cut His skull open 
QUICK FLASH: CONTINUE SLOW MOTION CLOSE UP. Pooh-Bear reaching for something OFFSCREEN. POOH-BEAR (V.O.) (calmly) You know, those Saws All really do cut through everything. 
BACK TO PRESENT: Danny getting nervous. 
DANNY Look, you don't have to ... 
POOH-BEAR (cont'd) So I'm standing there looking at this dude's brain and I'm thinking to myself, you know, this guy doesn't really need this thing. I mean, anyone stupid enough to jam me up doesn't really use their brain to begin with. You know what I'm saying? (beat, dead serious) So I took it. 
Pooh-Bear makes a POPPING SOUND as he illustrates with his hands. 
QUICK FLASH BACK: Pooh-Bear looking down at SOMETHING in his hand, his face blossoming into a sick smile. 
BACK TO PRESENT: Danny listens somberly. 
POOH-BEAR (cont'd) Hell, I make better use out of it than he ever did.  Got it up in my freezer. I take it out from time-to- time, mix a little of it up in my dinner .... (looks at the plate of eggs) ... of breakfast. 
ON THE PLATE - little chunks of gray matter mixed in with the eggs. 
Pooh-Bear smiles knowingly.  Danny turns pale. 
POOH-BEAR 10,000 a pound 
Danny decides to nerve it out 
DANNY Now you're insulting me.  Nice talking business with you. 
Danny gets up to leave. One of his hands shaking uncontrollably. He steadies it with the other hand. 
POOH-BEAR 9,000.  Take it or leave it. 
Danny stops. 
DANNY I'll leave it.  Eight is as high as I'll go.  See ya'. 
Danny goes to leave again. 
POOH-BEAR All right, all right. Don't get your knickers in a knot. I can live with eight. 
Pooh-Bear stands up. 
POOH-BEAR (cont'd) You got a deal. 
They shake hands. 
POOH-BEAR God damn, Danny, you got some nerve. Pooh-Bear respects that. (beat) Oh, by the way ... 
Pooh-Bear takes something from the kitchen counter and tosses it on the table ... 
... a store-bought package of COW BRAINS. 
QUICK FLASH BACK: REVEAL that Pooh-Bear has been standing at the meat section in a GROCERY STORE. He is looking down at the package of COW BRAINS in his hand. 
POOH-BEAR (in the grocery store) Hmm. Good price. 
Pooh-Bear tosses the package in his cart and walks away, whistling. 
BACK TO PRESENT: 
POOH-BEAR (cont'd) You want to stay for lunch? 
He stops. COLETTE What? 
DANNY Nothing. 
COLETTE Go ahead. 
DANNY Look, it's really none of my business but why don't you just dump this guy? 
COLETTE It's not that easy. 
DANNY Don't tell me, down deep he's really not a bad person and you don't want to see him get hurt. 
COLETTE Who the fuck are you, Dr. Joyce Brothers? (beat) I hate the son-of-a-bitch. 
DANNY Then leave. 
COLETTE I can't. 
DANNY Why not? 
COLETTE You don't understand. 
DANNY There's nothing to understand. The guy is a pig. 
COLETTE I can't leave. 
DANNY You get off on abuse or something? 
COLETTE Fuck you. 
DANNY Then why don't you leave? (beat) Just give me one good reason. 
COLETTE Because he'll kill me. 
The waitress and cook look up. 
COLETTE (cont'd) Is that simple enough for you? 
DANNY Why don't you call the cops? 
COLETTE Why? They don't hold him for more than a day or two. 
DANNY That's long enough to get out of town. 
COLETTE I can't. I've got a kid.  She lives with my parents.  Quincey knows where they live. 
Danny chews it over for a second then ... 
DANNY Then make sure he gets put away for longer. 
COLETTE How? 
Danny hesitates, not sure of how much he wants to get involved. 
COLETTE (cont'd) Tell me how. 
DANNY I don't know. (beat) Let me think about it. 
EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
Urban blight abounds 
INT. BURNED OUT BUILDING - NIGHT 
The grafitti-filled, cluttered shell of what used to be some sort of offices. 
BUBBA THE ASIAN COWBOY sitting on a desk. Danny pacing back and forth in front of him. 
BUBBA (Texas drawl) I wanna do a small buy first.  Ten thousand.  We'll see how it goes. 
DANNY Why? The guys is ready to deal now. 
BUBBA Because I don't know him and I don't really know you, partner. 
DANNY Now that's down-right insulting. 
BUBBA I'll have to live with that.  My money my risk, my rules. 
Bubba takes a plastic-wrapped bundle of money from his pocket.  Tosses it on the table. 
EXT. ALLEY - SAME 
Tanner and Garcetti ensconced in an alley diagonally across the street. 
Garcetti pointing a LONG-RANGE PARABOLIC MICROPHONE at the burned out building.  He and Tanner wear earpieces, which are attached to the mike. 
DANNY (O.S.) (filtered, broken) I guess I don't have a hell of a lot of choice. 
BUBBA (O.S.) (filtered) Get used to it.  You're in a very tenuous position on the food chain, hoss. 
Garcetti removes his earpiece and turns to Tanner. 
GARCETTI You thinking what I'm thinking? 
TANNER Yeah.  This could be the one we're looking for. 
EXT. BURNED OUT BUILDING - SAME 
Bubba exits the building and disappears around the corner. 
TANNER You better not be blowing smoke up My ass, Flynne. 
DANNY After that ass-whipping you gave me? 
Garcetti suppresses a smile. 
GARCETTI (finishing up with the bundle) What's on the other end of this thing? 
DANNY Now that I can help you with. Nasty boy ... goes by the name of Pooh-Bear. He's a chef. Check with Palmdale P.D. I'm sure they're keeping box scores on the guy. 
GARCETTI Sounds like you hooked up with some fine citizens, Flynne. 
DANNY Oh they're all that and the proverbial bag of chips. 
TANNER What're your taking down? 
DANNY Standard vig.  Minus five for a certain blabber-mouth moron by the name of Jimmy the Finn, who's living proof that natural selection is a flawed theory. 
Tanner looks at Danny quizzically. 
TANNER Did you really think you were slick enough to pull this off? 
DANNY Look man, I just wanted to make some dough and disappear.  I didn't want to wait around for Domingo to figure out who doubled back on him. 
Danny holds his hands up 
DANNY (cont'd) But now I've seen the error of my ways.  I'll just walk away ... call the whole deal off. 
GARCETTI Wrong. 
He tosses the bundle of cash to Danny. 
DANNY You mean you want me to roll on these guys? 
Their silence is answer enough. 
DANNY (cont'd) No. No way.  These guys catch a whiff and I'm a fucking bag of Bandini. 
TANNER You've got no choice. 
DANNY Whata you mean I've got no choice? 
TANNER Well, if you'd rather do a stretch in la casa grande ... 
DANNY For that old possession charge? Gimme a break. 
TANNER No. You just handed us a new one.  We can go Federal on your ass right now: ongoing criminal conspiracy. Intent to buy and distribute $250,000 worth of crank.  What's the mandatory on that, Al? 
GARCETTI Dime, minimum. 
MOVE OFF GARCETTI and over to a wall mounted heating vent.  MOVE INTO THE VENT, then ... 
... OUT OF A VENT in another room. 
BUBBA lurking in the shadows. Listening to the conversation through the wall vent in the other room. 
TANNER (O.S.) And believe me, word will get out that you're a pro rat. 
GARCETTI (O.S.) That's not good in prison. It's just not good. 
Bubba listens intently. 
INT. CAR - NIGHT 
Danny hunkered down in the back sea.  Garcetti sniffing the air. 
GARCETTI What's that smell? 
DANNY That would be me. 
GARCETTI What'd you do, piss your pants? 
DANNY Hell, yes!  What the hell do you expect zapping Mr. Johnson with that crackler? 
Garcetti looks back at Danny with a twisted smile. 
GARCETTI Who'd have thought it?  Danny "Chickenshit" Flynne trying to go large right under our noses. 
DANNY Lay off, Garcetti.  I'm not in the mood. 
GARCETTI No.  You've got me all wrong.  I mean, in you own pussified way, you actually got some nuts in your little sack. 
TANNER Bullshit. He's a liar. 
DANNY News-flash, Tanner. I'm a fucking rat. 
TANNER You think you're so god damned smart, don't you? 
The dynamic has suddenly changed in the trio's relationship.  Tanner is now the bad cop. 
TANNER (cont'd) Well, you played the wrong mark this time, asshole. 
EXT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL - NIGHT 
Danny approaching the building, we hear shots ... 
... THE RED CAR from earlier, prowling the streets.  Danny ducks into a liquor store and watches from the window. 
The red car cruises slowly past. 
GARCETTI You're paranoid, Flynne.  I think that crank is finally starting to get the best of you. 
EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
Danny waiting on the corner. 
GARCETTI (V.O.) When is the deal going down? 
DANNY (V.O.) I'm making the small buy tonight ... if I don't get beaten to death with a wheelchair or something.  If everyone is happy, we'll do the big deal later in the week. 
Jimmy's Vega sputters to a stop in front of Danny.  Jimmy gets out and hands Danny the keys. 
ON THE BUMPTER, a hand-made sign. It reads: PULL ME OVER. I DARE YOU! 
Danny sighs. Walks to the back, rips the sign off and gets in the car, leaving Jimmy with the sign. JIMMY You sure you don't want me to go with you? 
Danny burns rubber. 
EXT. POOH-BEAR'S COMPOUND - NIGHT 
Danny being led towards a trailer by TWO OF POOH-BEAR'S MEN. LITTLE BILL AND BIG BILL. Little Bill is big and Big Bill is little. 
INT. HOUSE - SAME 
Pooh-Bear sitting in a recliner, obscured by shadows when Danny and his escorts enter. 
A WIRE CAGE IN THE CORNER, SOMETHING MOVING AROUND INSIDE.  It too is obscured by shadows. 
Pooh-Bear doesn't look up. He is preoccupied with something in his hand which he is cleaning with a toothbrush. 
DANNY Pooh-Bear, my man.  What's up? 
Pooh-Bear doesn't respond. Continues brushing. 
LITTLE BILL He's blue. 
BIG BILL Comin' down from a 10 day ride. 
Danny closes his eyes. Not what he wanted to hear. 
DANNY You want to do this some other time? 
POOH-BEAR (gloomy and tired) Pull your pants down. 
DANNY I'm sorry? 
POOH-BEAR Pull your motherfucking pants down. 
Danny looks to the two Bills for help. 
DANNY (laughing nervously) Come on, guys ... 
POOH-BEAR Big Bill. 
Big Bill pulls a 19th century double-barreled FLINTLOCK PISTOL from his jacket and points it at Danny's head. 
BIG BILL Argh, matie. I'm a pirate. 
POOH-BEAR Little Bill 
Little Bill drops Danny's trousers.  Danny about to object when he is started into silence. 
The saturnine Pooh-Bear raises his head, illuminating his face.  He isn't wearing his prosthetic nose.  A GAPING HOLE WHERE HIS NOSE SHOULD BE.  He looks like some obscene human bat. 
Pooh-Bear holds up the plastic nose he has been cleaning, inspecting it under the light. 
POOH-BEAR (cont'd) Introduce him to Captain Steubing. 
He pops his nose back into place, but it goes on crooked. 
The Bills escort Danny over to the cage.  There is A GIGANTIC CRAZED WEASEL INSIDE. 
The cage is divided by a large piece of Plexiglas. 
POOH-BEAR (cont'd) You'll have to excuse him, he ain't ate for over a week. 
The weasel is foaming at the mouth. 
POOH-BEAR (cont'd) That and the rabies.  Don't make for a happy weasel. 
DANNY (trying to stay calm) Pooh-Bear. come on, man.  What is this? (off Pooh-Bear's silence) It's me, Danny. I thought we had a deal. 
POOH-BEAR Big Bill 
Big Bill pushes Danny up to the cage, which comes up to about waist level. 
POOH-BEAR Captain Steubing thinks you might work for the police. 
DANNY What?! 
Pooh-Bear holds up his hand. 
POOH-BEAR Don't address me.  I didn't make the accusation. 
DANNY Please .. I don't know what you're ... 
POOH-BEAR Uh-uh-uh ... 
He points to the cage.   Danny looks down at the weasel, which is trying to gnaw through the Plexiglas. 
DANNY Who is it? 
COLETTE (O.S.) It's me. 
DANNY I'm kind of busy. 
COLETTE (O.S.) Please open the door, Danny. 
He pockets the check and the license, closes the lockbox and goes over to the door. 
Colette standing on the other side.  Her FACE AND ARMS ARE BLACK AND BLUE WITH BRUISES. DANNY Oh Jesus. 
He lets her come in.  Colette looks away. 
DANNY (cont'd) Colette ... You've gotta leave. 
COLETTE We been through that. 
DANNY What about a battered woman's shelter? You can move you kid in with you. 
COLETTE I need my paycheck. 
DANNY You can still work. 
COLETTE He knows where I work. 
DANNY Find a new job. 
COLETTE It's not that easy. I just got a raise. I need the money. 
DANNY You always been this stubborn? 
Colette cracks a crooked smile. 
COLETTE From day one. (beat) I was a breach birth. They tried for hours to turn my little butt around. But I wouldn't let 'em. 
DANNY Ass first into the world. 
COLETTE I been that way ever since. 
Danny smiles.  He gently touches her eye.  Colette reaches up and touches Danny's bruised eye. COLETTE (cont'd) Look at us.  What a pair. 
Colette leans in to kiss him, but they bump bad eyes. 
COLETTE/DANNY Ouch. They laugh. 
COLETTE Can we try that again? 
They kiss again.  Deep and long.  Danny suddenly pulls back mid-kiss. 
DANNY I can't. 
Colette goes to touch him. He pulls away. 
DANNY (cont'd) I can't. 
COLETTE Why not? 
DANNY I just can't. Okay? 
Danny paces uncomfortably. 
COLETTE What's wrong, Danny? 
DANNY Look, maybe you oughta' leave. 
COLETTE No. I want to know what the hell is going on. 
DANNY I can't tell you. 
Colette comes to a slow realization. 
COLETTE There's someone else, isn't there? 
THE FLASHBACK IMAGERY suddenly FLICKERS TO LIFE on the wall behind Danny - THE MOONLIGH SALTON SEA. 
Danny freezes.  Looks up at Colette. DANNY Yes. 
Colette waits a beat, then turns to leave. 
DANNY (cont'd) Don't go. (beat) Please, Colette. (she stops) Stay and talk to me, please. 
Something about Danny's voice - a raw vulnerability - which we haven't seen in him before.  MOVE OFF of Danny and ONTO THE FLASHBACK IMAGE. 
DANNY (O.S.) I'm so tired of lying. CUT TO: 
EXT. CREPPY HOUSE - SALTON SEA - NIGHT (FLASHBACK) 
Danny's car parked out front. 
INT. CREEPY HOUSE - SALTON SEA - NIGHT 
A CHUBBY GUY sitting on the couch in his underwear, watching A MEXICAN WESTERN.  He sits there with wide eyes, GRINDING HIS JAWS. 
Danny, Liz AND BO, the affable owner of the house, looking at a map on the kitchen table. 
BO What you want to do is go back the way you came and make a left at the bottom. It'll take you right to the highway. 
DANNY/TOM That's it? 
And with that it is all over. 
Danny tries to get to his feet again. Fails, His eyes flutter. All is silent except for A FAINT LIQUID SPATTERING. 
LONG SHOT-Back on the Salton Sea, placid and silvered with moonlight. 
INT RESIDENTIAL HOTEL ROOM- NIGHT (LATER) 
Danny and Colette face-to face- in profile, silhouetted by the IMAGE of the sea. 
DANNY She died knowing that I was a coward... that I didn't lift a finger to help her. 
COLLETTE There was nothing you could have done. 
She is inches closer to him. 
DANNY No, you're wrong, I tried to tell myself the same thing but I could have gotten up. I could have done something. 
COLETTE They would have killed you too. 
DANNY (finally looks her in the eye) Nothing could be worse then this slow death I'm living now. 
Colette puts her arms around him and hugs him tight. The IMAGE OF THE SEA FLICKERS AND FADES behind them. 
CLOSE ON DANNY-holding Colette. 
DANNY (looking up) Colette...I want to help you, with Quincey. 
Colette pulls back. 
COLETTE No Danny, Don't- 
DANNY (cont'd) But you gotta be serious about it. 
COLETTE Really, I don't want to. 
DANNY I want to do this for you.  I want to do something good for a change. 
Danny goes over to the dresser. Takes out a baggie of meth. 
DANNY (cont'd) I want you to hide this somewhere where Quincy won't find it. 
COLETTE What is it? 
DANNY Never mind. Just do what I say. He holds out the baggie. Colette backs away. 
COLETTE I don't want to. 
Danny stalks her. 
DANNY I'm offering you the chance to take care of your problems. Take it. (she still hesitates) Don't make the same mistake I did, Colette. Do something while you have a chance. Do it for your daughter before something happens. (beat) Believe me, you don't want to live with this burden. (firm) He helds the baggie out again. Colette reluctantly takes it from him. 
DANNY (cont'd) Tommorrow night, when he is asleep. I want you to beep me at this number. He writes the number down on a dollar bill. 
DANNY Will you do that? (off her nod) Then I want you to get out of the room. 
COLETTE Why? 
DANNY Don't worry about it. Just go across the street and watch. You'll know when it's safe to go back. 
Colette goes to protest. Danny puts his hand to her mouth the same way she did to him earlier. 
DANNY Just do it. All your problems with Quincey will be taken care of. 
INT. CINDER BLOCK BAR - DAY 
Empty except for Danny and Jimmy in a back booth. Danny slides an envelope over to Jimmy. 
JIMMY What's this? 
DANNY Tem thousand dollars. Everything I could spare. (beat) It's for you. 
JIMMY But why? You only owe me five. And that's not till after we close the deal tonight. 
DANNY You aren't coming with me. 
Jimmy looks hurt. 
DANNY (cont'd) I need you to do me a favor instead. 
JIMMY Okay 
DANNY Wait till I tell you what it is. 
JIMMY It don't matter. I'll do it. And you sure as hell don't have to pay me. 
Jimmy slides the money back over. 
DANNY Why? 
JIMMY You're my best friend, man. I'd do anything for you. 
Danny smiles, genuinely touched. 
DANNY Jimmy, look, there's something I have to tell you. 
JIMMY Hey, check it out... 
Jimmy rolls his sleeve up, revealing a tattoo. 
BUBBA Yeah. 
CONVERSATION WILL INTERCUT BETWEEN TWO LOCATIONS 
DANNY Everything go? 
BUBBA Yeah. 
DANNY Just make sure you come alone. This guy won't like any surprises 
BUBBA I ain't a idiot, asshole. 
DANNY I'll see you tonight. 
Bubba hangs up. 
Danny turns the phone off. 
TANNER Man of few words. 
Danny hands the phone back to Garcetti 
GARCETTI Nervous? 
DANNY With you clowns watching my back? What do you think? 
Danny opens the back door. 
GARCETTI Just make sure you hit the floor when we come in. It could get ugly in there. 
TANNER Yeah, I'd hate to shoot you by accident. 
Danny gets out of the car. Shuts the door. 
EXT. CAR-SAME 
Danny watches them drive away. When he is sure that they are gone, he looks around. Sees... ...A PLUMBER'S TRUCK parked on the other side of the park. 
INT. PLUMBER'S TRUCK-SAME AN HISPANIC GUY behind the wheel. 
HISPANIC GUY He's coming in. 
As Danny approaches the truck, the door slides open. He piles in. 
VOICES (O.S.) How'd it go? 
DANNY You tell me. 
Danny pulls a TINY MICROPHONE AND WIRE from inside his shirt and hands it to... ...Bubba, who sits in front of a BANK OF LISTENING EQUIPMENT. 
BUBBA You ready to go meet the team? 
EXT. FEDERAL BUILDING - WESTWOOD - DAY 
The PLUMBER'S TRUCK enters the underground parking lot. 
INT. F.B.I. OFFICES-DAY 
TEN F.B.I. AGENTS in a small conference room, looking at... 
...Danny and Bubba, sitting at the head of the table. BUBBA is now wearing his security badge, which reads, SPECIAL AGENT TEX TRAHN. He stands up and addresses the group. 
And he really does have a SOUTHERN ACCENT. 
TRAHN For those of you who don't know this is Tom Van Allen... a.k.a.  Danny Flynne. 
Danny looks self-conscious. 
TRAHN (cont'd) About a year and half ago, Mr. Van Allen's wife was murdered at a meth lab out near the Salton Sea. No one was ever apprehended for the crime but local authorities have always assumed it was a hit and grab perpetrated by rival drug dealers. That is, until Tom here took it upon himself to conduct a one-man undercover operation at great risk to his own personal safety. 
One of the agents pipes up... 
AGENT ONE He's a civilian? (off Trahn's nod) How the hell did you pull this off? 
Trahn turns to Danny. 
DANNY I played the long shot. Just got lucky. 
INT. SALTON SEA SHERIFF'S STATION (FLASHBACK) - DAY 
Danny and DETECTIVE BOOKMAN, a homicide detective, sitting at a table. 
BOOKMAN How about the car? The model? 
Danny shakes his head. 
BOOKMAN (cont'd) Was it a truck?  S.U.V.? Sedan? 
DANNY All I saw was the headlights. The high beams were on. 
BOOKMAN Not even a guess? 
DANNY (pissed off0 How many times do we have to go through this? 
ANOTHER DETECTIVE enters the room, hands something to bookman, then whispers into Bookman's ear. Bookman nods. 
BOOKMAN (cont'd) You said one of the perpetrators crossed in front of the headlights ... 
DANNY Yeah, but he was in silhouette. 
EXT. STREET-NIGHT (LATER) 
Danny spread-eagle over the hood with Garcetti roughly searching him. 
DANNY (V.O.) I dropped myself right in their laps. 
Garcetti pulls a baggie of meth from Danny's pocket. 
EXT. DESERTED PARK-NIGHT 
Danny, Garcetti and Tanner at the picnic table, talking. 
DANNY (V.O.) I gave up whoever they asked for, whenever they wanted. I was a fucking dream rat. But the whole time I was sizing them up, looking for any evidence that they were the guys who killed my wife. 
EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING-NIGHT 
Danny watching from the shadows as Tanner and Garcetti haul a DOPE DEALER away in cuffs. 
DANNY (V.O.) But they did everything by the book. 
F.B.I. OFFICES-DAY 
DANNY I knew that if these were the guys I was looking for, I'd have to set up a deal so sweet, they wouldn't be able to walk away from it. 
TRAHN That's when he called me. He told me his story and he pitched me a plan. 
DANNY These guys are smart. I knew they wouldn't hit a deal unless they knew all the players. I needed a big buyer. 
EXT. ROOFTOP-NIGHT 
Tanner and Garcetti watching Battle enter the building. 
TRAHN (V.O.) We had one of our C.I.'s call Tanner and Garcetti with an "anonymous" tip about the deal. 
TANNER (the line takes on a whole new meaning) This could be the one we're looking for. 
INT. POLICE STATION - DAY 
Garcetti scanning the print he took from the plastic wrapper. 
A COMPUTER SCREEN - the F.B.I. fingerprinting database. A MATCH IS MADE. BUBBA/ TRAHN'S PHOTO appears, along with the pertinent information. 
BATTLE (V.O.) ...I dumped a dummy file into the system. They took the bait and we were off to the races. 
INT. F.B.I. OFFICES-DAY 
Another agent kicks in. 
AGENT TWO How sure are you that you're not chasing two good cops? I mean all you've really got  is one red hair. That's still your only evidence. 
TRAHN Not anymore. We tapped these guys' phones and computers at Gardena P.D. Tanner and Garcetti didn't report on this deal. Not a peep. They haven't coordinated with Palmdale P.D. They're keeping it off the books. It looks like we've got the right guys. (beat) We'll find out for sure tonight. 
INT. F.B.I. OFFICES-DAY (LATER) 
The meeting breaking up. Trahn walks Danny away from the conference room. 
TRAHN How you holding up? 
DANNY I'm fine. Little nervous...little disappointed that I didn't finish this myself. 
TRAHN Hey, you did the right thing. You wouldn't have stood a chance against these boys by yourself. They have eaten your ass alive. 
Danny's PAGER STARTS BEEPING. He checks the readouts. 
DANNY Oh shit 
TRAHN What? 
DANNY Can you do me a favor? This girl I know, her boyfriend's a real piece of shit-dude's really jamming her up. I promised her I'd try to help. 
Danny pockets the pager. 
DANNY (cont'd) Could you call Gardena P.D. tell 'em you got a tip that the guy's holding? Maybe have 'em send out a patrol car? 
TRAHN I'll see what I can do. 
INT. BANK-DAY 
Danny at the counter with a big gym bag. 
A TELLER COUNTS out stacks of money. 
THE LIFE INSURANCE CHECK lays on the counter in front of her. We see the amount -- $250,000.00 
EXT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL ROOM-NIGHT 
Colette standing across the street, looking at... 
...TWO COPS exiting a patrol car. 
Colette is crying her eyes out. She is HOLDING the BAGGIE OF METH that Danny gave her. 
The cops enter the building just as... 
... Danny drives by in Jimmy's car, followed by... 
... TWO OF THE AGENTS from the conference room. They remain a good half-block behind him. 
INT. JIMMY'S CAR-NIGHT 
ON THE BLACK AND WHITE SURVEILLANCE MONITOR NEXT DOOR. 
TRAHN You alone? 
Danny nods. 
TRAHN (cont'd) Any word from Pooh-Bear? 
Danny shakes his head. 
TRAHN (cont'd) You okay, hoss? 
BACK INSIDE THE ROOM 
Trahn walks over to Danny, who sits there with his head down, his face obscured by a baseball cap. Slowly, he looks up. 
IT IS JIMMY. 
TRAHN (cont'd) What the hell? 
JIMMY Danny told me to tell you that he was sorry. (beat) He said he had to take care of this himself. 
EXT. BLUFF - NIGHT 
Tanner scanning with the night vision glasses. 
TANNER Here he comes. 
REVEAL that the car is on a bluff above POOH-BEAR'S COMPOUND. 
Danny pulls up in a rental car. 
INT. DANNY'S CAR - SAME 
Danny's hand is shaking uncontrollably. 
DANNY Easy, boy. 
He looks at his hand again. It continues to shake.  He takes a deep breath. 
TANNER'S P.O.V. 
As Danny gets out of the car and goes to the trunk. 
Tanner watching. 
TANNER Where's Bubba? 
GARCETTI Maybe he isn't showing. 
Danny takes a gym bag out of the trunk and approaches Pooh-Bear's house. 
TANNER Looks like Flynne's handling the cash. Let's get into position. 
They get out of the car and trek down the bluff towards the house. 
INT. POOH-BEAR'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Big Bill lets Danny in, then pats him down for weapons.  Satisfied, he leads Danny to the kitchen. 
IN THE KITCHEN - Danny enters and stops.  A worried look. 
Pooh-Bear along with THREE OTHER MEN.  The men eye Danny silently. They look like ex-cons. 
DANNY What the hell is this? 
POOH-BEAR Just some buddies. 
DANNY This is bullshit.  You didn't say anything about anybody else being here. 
POOH-BEAR What the fuck are you gonna do about it, dickhead? 
The other guys snicker, one of them almost spitting his beer out. 
Danny smiles good-naturedly.  Shoots a look over at ... 
... one of the guys sitting where he taped his gun earlier. 
DANNY Come on, man, let's deal. 
He throws the bag on the table, knocking a beer into the guys lap.  The guy springs up, pissed off. 
POOH-BEAR Cool it. We got business. 
DANNY Yeah, dickhead. 
Danny moves over and plops down in the guys seat. 
UNDER THE TABLE - Danny fumbling with the gun, trying to untape it without being too obvious. 
Pooh-Bear unzips the bag. Inside, a lot of cash. 
POOH-BEAR Oh my, oh my. (beat) Big Bill, come take a look at this. 
Big Bill is behind Danny, over by the sink.  He pulls his FLINTLOCK and walks over. 
Danny continues trying to get the gun loose.  Something catches his eye 
... the MICROWAVE OVEN DOOR is open, casting a reflection of the room behind him.  Big Bill approaches Danny, pointing the gun at Danny's head. 
Danny sitting there with Liz in a pool of blood.  He notices something on the floor ... 
... LIZ'S PURSE, the contents spilled on the floor.  A GREETING CAR with a teddy bear and the word "CONGRATUALTIONS" on the front. 
Danny goes over and picks up the card. 
INSERT - CARD 
He opens it  ... "YOU'RE A DADDY!"  A home pregnancy test taped inside, the reading is POSITIVE. 
Danny drops the card.  Stares down at it as ... 
... the blood from the floor pools out and engulfs the card. 
EXT. SALTON SEA - NIGHT 
On the placid sea as DANNY'S HORRIFIC SCREAM resounds from the house in the distance. 
INT. POOH-BEAR'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
ON DANNY standing in the hallway, staring, his face a blank. 
ON POOH-BEAR - cooking up a huge dose of meth with a lighted hundred dollar bill. 
He draws the meth into a syringe then turns on the stereo with a remote. 
A YODELING INSTRUCTION TAPE BLASTS FROM THE SPEAKERS. 
Pooh-Bear prepares to dose, looking for a vein in his neck, never noticing ... 
... Garcetti's gun moving to the back of Pooh-Bear's head. 
Pooh-Bear about to plunge the drugs when GARCETTI FIRES. 
Pooh-Bear pitches forward, dead.  The syringe falls to the floor. 
Tanner and Garcetti standing over him.  They pull their ski masks off. 
GARCETTI Get the bag. 
Garcetti holsters his weapon and picks up the bag of money from the floor. 
GARCETTI (cont'd) Let's get out of here. 
A GUNSHOT.  Garcetti goes down where he stands.  He lays there twitching like a rabbit. 
Tanner staring down the sucker's end of Danny's gun. 
TANNER Danny? 
DANNY My name is Tom. 
Tanner frowns. 
DANNY (cont'd) Tom Van Allen 
Danny raises his gun. 
TANNER Whatever you say, man.  Look ... can we talk about this? 
DANNY Yeah. Okay. Listen carefully ... (beat) You're in the bathroom.  You've been shot in the shoulder ... 
Danny shoots Tanner in the shoulder.  He collapses to the floor. 
ON GARCETTI - his eyes flutter and open. 
Danny walks over to Tanner and stands above him. 
DANNY (cont'd) ... there's two guys with masks and guns in the other room about to kill your wife. 
Tanner looks at Danny, confused. 
DANNY (cont'd) But you know if you go out there, they'll kill you, too.  You'll both die.  What do you do? 
Tanner realizes what Danny is talking about. 
DANNY (cont'd) Do you go out there and die like a man or do you live to fight another day? 
Tanner doesn't answer. 
Danny (cont'd) What do you do? 
Still no answer. 
DANNY (cont'd) Answer the question! 
Tanner is ghost white, loosing blood quickly. 
Danny (cont'd) What do you do! 
TANNER Please ... don't do this ... 
DANNY Answer the fucking question! 
When Danny goes to shoot Tanner again ... 
... Tanner pulls a K-BAR KNIFE from the back of his belt and plunges it into the back of Danny's gun hand.  The gun discharges, missing Tanner. 
Danny drops the gun.  Tanner snatches it up. 
DANNY My name is Tom Van Allen. I'm a trumpet player. 
Danny smiles. 
VOICE (O.S.) Nah, you're Danny Flynne. 
He turns. 
COLETTE and QUINCEY standing there.  Quincey holds a nine millimeter with a muzzle suppressor. 
QUINCEY You're a motherfucking rat. 
He shoots Danny in the stomach.  Danny slumps to the floor.  His cigarette falls out of his mouth and rolls under the bed. 
Colette freaks. 
COLETTE You said you wouldn't kill him! 
She tries to go to Danny but Quincey stops her. 
COLETTE You lied to me! 
QUINCEY Oops.  My bad. 
Danny looks at them, confused, a blood stain blossoming on his white shirt. 
DANNY Colette, what happened?  Didn't the cops ... 
QUINCEY The cops came.  But they didn't find nothing.  Turns out their C.I. game 'em some bad information. 
Quincey holds up the baggie of drugs. 
Danny looks from Quincey to Colette.  Colette looks away. 
QUINCEY (cont'd) You fuck with the Mexicali Boys, this is what you get, homes. 
UNDER THE BED - the cigarette smoldering on the carpet. 
QUINCEY (cont'd) Domingo thought you might be the one who went rat on him. 
Quincey looks at Colette 
QUINCEY (cont'd) So I brought in a rat of my own. 
Danny looks at Colette, dumbfounded. 
DANNY You set me up? 
QUINCEY Bitch played you like a squeezebox, Romeo. 
Danny can't help from laughing at the irony.  Beads of sweat are forming on his blanched face.  He looks at Colette with a wry smile. 
DANNY You're good, princess. I'll give you that. 
COLETTE Danny, it's not what you think. 
Danny looks down at his bloody stomach. 
COLETTE I owed them money ... a lot of money ... they didn't give me a choice.  You know how it works.  When I got to know you, I tried to back out ... that's when they did this ... (she indicates the bruises) But I told them I wouldn't do it .. I didn't want to see you get hurt. 
Danny stares at her, not sure what to believe.  He looks over at Quincey. 
DANNY She selling me a bill, home boy? 
Quincey shakes his head. 
QUINCEY Nah, she ain't lying.  She took a pretty good beating from you, ace. I seen grown men crack after a lot less.  But not this bitch. (beat) It was very touching. 
DANNY Then why are we here? 
COLETTE They threatened to kill my daughter. (beat) I had no choice. (beat) I'm sorry, Danny. 
Danny looks at Colette, imagining the awful beating she must have taken. 
DANNY It's okay. It's okay. (Danny touches her face.) (beat) God damn, you're beautiful. 
UNDER THE BED - THE CARPET IGNITES.  The fire spreads quickly. 
QUINCEY Jesus. 
Quincey grabs her arm. 
QUINCEY (cont'd) Let's go. 
COLETTE No! 
The drapes go up in flames.  Quincey puts the gun to the back of her head. 
QUINCEY You wanna die here with him or come with me? 
DANNY Colette, go. 
COLETTE I don't want to leave you. 
DANNY Your daughter needs you.  Go. 
The fire continues to spread.  Colette kisses Danny on the lips. Quincey pulls her away. 
Collette looks back one last time just as the flames reach the door, cutting off any escape.

Gone In 60 Seconds - Scott Rosenberg 
GONE IN 60 SECONDS by Scott Rosenberg 
"I wonder," Toad said to himself presently, "I wonder if this sort of car starts easily?" Next moment, hardly knowing how it came about, he found that he had hold of the handle and was turning it. As the familiar sound broke forth, the old passion seized on Toad and completely mastered him, body and soul ... He increased his pace, and as the car devoured the street, he was only conscious that he was Toad once more, Toad at his best and highest. And he sped he knew not whither, fulfilling his instincts, living his hour, reckless of what might come to him... " 
-- Kenneth Grahame, "THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS"

FADE IN: 
EXT. LONG BEACH STREET - LOWER GRAND - NIGHT 
The streets are empty. Low fog skims the sidewalks below a gray stew of a sky. It's slightly fuzzy, slightly surreal.  The vast Port of Los Angeles is visible in the b.g... No cars parked here ... No cars except - 
A '67 SHELBY MUSTANG GT-500 
Silver with deep grill, its sculptured side panels ending in air scoops ... All cock and balls, it stands alone in the lonely cool before dawn ... An old-school totem to speed and style... And then SOMEONE approaches... 
Through the mists of morning ... In leather coat and jack boots ... He's early 30s, with the vaguely whimsical confidence of a shimmer that refuses to fade ... 
This is RANDALL RAINES, whom they call MEMPHIS - though know one's quite sure why ... But they do know he's the auto-boost in Southern California ... 
Memphis approaches the Mustang with a gathering awe ... Like a desert crash survivor coming upon an oasis ... He walks around it ... Admiring it ... Adoring it ... 
But then a FIREBIRD pulls up alongside him. Its driver - ATLEY JACKSON, early 30s, handsome, jocular leans out for: 
ATLEY JACKSON You gonna steal her or kneel down to her and pray -- ? 
Memphis looks at him, still enthralled... 
ATLEY JACKSON (cont'd) I know, I know ... It's Eleanor ... Just take her, slick. - - 
And Atley drives off slowly, Memphis looks this way and that ... No one about ... He removes a SLIM JIM from a deep pocket in his coat... He slims the door panel ... Pops the button ... opens the door ... 
Watch him work. Quick as shit. A SCREWDRIVER appears another pocket ... He pops the BUTTERFLY to the IGNITION 
A RATCHET appears... He strips the mechanism... Now a GIZMO - a,small socket-like device - is pressed into the ignition ... A twist of the wrist ... And the 320-bhp 289 V8 rumbles like a jackhammer. The whole thing took 20 seconds. 
He takes a cassette TAPE from another pocket ... Slaps it into the deck. Bruce Springsteen's "Ramrod" wails from the coaxials. And Memphis floors it... And off they tear... 
The look on his face suggests a supreme satisfaction ... A grand re-awakening of long-dormant pleasure centers ... A speed Jones, fixed and fumy ... 
He slots in behind Atley Jackson's Firebird ... And slotting in behind Memphis, in a Z-28, is DONNY ASTRICKY, mid-30s ... 
On they go ... The fore and aft car providing escort... 
Except that, from seemingly out of nowhere -- 
A POLICE CAR 
appears behind them... 
And Donny instantly goes into diversionary tactic ... He races through a STOP SIGN ... And the cruiser's bubbles flash on ... And Donny is pulled-over ... Atley and Memphis drive on in their respective vehicles... 
The UNIFORM COP gets out of his car, goes to Donny. 
DONNY Problem, Officer? 
POLICEMAN Yes. You're under arrest -- ? 
DONNY For running a stop sign? 
POLICEMAN For Grand Theft Auto - 
And off of Donny's look -- 
We go to Memphis in the Shelby... As FOUR CRUISERS comes speeding toward him, sirens wailing... 
QUICK SHOTS of Memphis racing the Shelby through the early morning harbor town streets ... Sirens peel ... Memphis turns up the music ... Pins the gas ... The chase is on ... 
Memphis maneuvers the Mustang with a dazzling aplomb... Memphis gutterballing the car, skating the shoulder, the cops in heavy pursuit ... 
And now he's picked up another CRUISER... He passes Atley Jackson, heading in the opposite direction... Atley has picked-up a pair of cruisers himself ... 
Memphis on a straightaway now, speeds up, feels the boost. But up ahead, a ROADBLOCK has formed... How'd they get that deployed so fast? And behind him, the unmarks blaze ... 
Guns his bitch... Straight at the roadblock .. Three CRUISERS and a PORTABLE WOODEN BARRICADE... Memphis pins her ... ZOOOOOM! Dead-on to the roadblock ... 
And, at the last moment, as the COPS dive out of the way, Memphis bangs the gear shift into neutral -- yanks the parking brake -- And the Mustang spins on the straight -- Screeching spin ... And Memphis takes the HARD LEFT ... 
And he's managed to outrun them... Finding himself above Lower Grand... Looking down ... 
He can see the secondary pursuit down below ... Atley being chased... IN THE DISTANCE - Atley is LAUNCHED FROM THE SHOULDER, the Firebird rolling down a drainage culvert ... 
Landing with a sickening thud on its back. Memphis is horrified. 
EXT. LOWER GRAND - LATER 
Rescue team presence. Atley being hauled out of the wreck... His leg is a torn mess ... He's barely conscious... A cuffed Donny Astricky is dragged to a waiting cruiser ... 
A POLICE CAR pulls up ... And out steps 
DETECTIVE ROLAND CASTLEBECK 
of G.R.A.B. The Governor's Regional Auto-theft Bureau. Castlebeck is mid-50s, black, saturnine. - But don't let the tacit nobility fool you - the man's a street viper ... 
Castlebeck goes to another cop - HAWKINGS.. 
HAWKINGS Astricky. And Jackson. No sign of Raines... 
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK Well, then it's all for naught, ain't it, Hawkings? 
TOM (O.S.) Uh ... Randall -- ? 
MEMPHIS Excuse me -- 
Memphis goes back into the garage, Budgy cackles. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. RANCHO PALOS VERDES - BUSINESS DISTRICT 
A FORD ESCORT - driving through the upscale streets of Palos Verdes. Three KIDS, 20, inside ... The driver is FREB, a little dim; in the back is MIRROR MAN, black, always wears those mirrored shades ... In the passenger seat is 
KIP - Memphis' younger brother ... The car pulls to a stop. 
Fancy stores - all of them closed - line this affluent business district ... Freb consults a piece of paper ... 
FREB The corner of Hawthorne and Granvia. Tumbler messed up. He said the Lotus would be at the corner of Hawthorne and Granvia -- 
KIP He didn't mess up. There it is ... 
And he points ... To a CORNER BUILDING - EXOTIC MOTORS LTD. Twenty foot high glass - windows surround a SHOWROOM of EXOTIC DREAM CARS: Porsches and Ferraris, Lamborghinis and Bertones ... And- there it is, a 1996 LOTUS ESPRIT V8, gleaming in the all-night showroom lights... 
Freb and Mirror Man are startled 
FREB That -- ? 
MIRROR MAN You're shittin', right? Kip? 
He grins at them... He ain't shittin'... 
FREB How are we supposed to-- 
KIP Pop the trunk. I need my tool ... 
Freb scowls ... Pops the trunk ... Kip gets out ... Goes to the back ... Freb and Mirror Man share a spook -- 
MIRROR MAN What tool -- ? 
Kip reaches into the trunk.... Comes around to them... He's carrying A BRICK -- 
MIRROR MAN (cont'd) Oh, no -- 
And Kip walks toward "Exotic Motors"... Calm and cool ... Ten feet from it ... He winds up ... And HURLS THE BRICK AT THE WINDOW Which EXPLODES ON IMPACT, a SHOWER OF GLASS raining down ... 
ALARMS SQUEAL 
As Kip walks into the showroom, glass crunching underfoot. Freb and Mirror Man can't believe it -- 
INT. EXOTIC MOTORS 
Kip goes to the Lotus... With nary a glance around, he's got her open ... The Lotus' ALARM adds its song to the choir ... Kip, unmindful, gets behind the wheel ... Screwdriver to the mechanism... The alarm raging in here... 
In moments, the V8's massive 349bhp is bellowing... And Mirror Man climbs in beside him... And off they go ... Laying several inches of English rubber. Over the broken glass and out of the showroom... 
EXT. CITY STREETS - PALOS VERDES - NIGHT 
The Lotus races through these streets ... At high speeds ... 
MIRROR MAN Newsflash, Kip: you're driving a stolen car 
Kip smiles over the ascending speedometer -- 
KIP Yeah. Ain't it great -- ? 
And he pins her ... VROOOOOM -- ! 
CUT TO: 
A TENNIS BALL 
being bounced against the wall ... Caught ... Bounced again ... Thunk! Thunk! Thunk! 
INT. WAREHOUSE - LONG BEACH HARBOR - NIGHT 
A dozen purloined AUTOS are parked here ... And a number of SHIPPING CONTAINERS ... A thuggish MAN reads the paper ... The tennis ball bouncer is TUMBLER, 20 ... And he's sitting on a tilted back chair, and wall-bouncing the ball and annoying the piss out of 
ATLEY JACKSON 
whom we remember from the drop-car at our opening ... Atley walks with a LIMP now... Thunk! Thunk! Thunk! 
ATLEY JACKSON Can you stop that, for Chrissake? 
TUMBLER What's your problem, bro ? 
Thunk! Thunk! 
ATLEY JACKSON Where are they -- ? 
TUMBLER They'll be here. You nervous, bro? You? Back in the day, they say you had anti-freeze in them veins ... What happened -- ? 
And Atley intercepts the tennis ball ... And hurls it over to the far side of the warehouse ... Tumbler merely grins ... 
TUMBLER (cont'd) Relax and enjoy -- 
EXT. SAN PEDRO STREETS - THE LOTUS 
Heading for Long Beach... Stopped at a light ... A CAMARO pulls up next to them... A KID behind the wheel, a BLONDE beside him... 
Kip eyeballs them... Engines are revved... Challenges are implied... Mirror Man panics ... 
MIRROR MAN Stolen car, Kip. Stolen car, stolen car, stolen car ... 
KIP Stolen fast car... 
And the light turns green ... And he pops the clutch ... And they are off ... It's a good old fashioned drag race ... Kip smiles at the blonde ... Mirror Man is freaking out ... Kip's eyes are on fire ... He clocks the speedometer ... 
Atley takes a sip of his beer,... 
ATLEY JACKSON He took a job. And he fumbled it. Now he's jammed-up. Jammed-up bad... 
MEMPHIS What kind of job... ? 
ATLEY JACKSON A boost. A big boost ... 
MEMPHIS A boost? What's Kip doing on a boost? 
Atley frowns ... Looks at him... 
ATLEY JACKSON You're shittin', right? 
Clearly Memphis is not ... 
ATLEY JACKSON (cont'd) Kip's become quite the little crewrunner since you left. He's been working a low-rent ring for two years now. You don't talk to your Ma? 
MEMPHIS It seems she neglected to mention it 
ATLEY JACKSON Maybe she don't know. Although I don't see how that could be. Maybe she didn't want to upset you - 
MEMPHIS Don't feel the need to explore my family dynamics, Atley... 
ATLEY JACKSON The point is: Kip's been living the life. Only he's a wild child. Crazy. Makes our old behavior seem like altar boy time. But he fungold this one so bad, folks around L.B. are already speakin' about him in the past tense. 
Memphis takes a beat ... Sips at his brew ... Then: 
MEMPHIS Who was the job for? 
ATLEY JACKSON Who do you think? 
Memphis waits ... In no mood for guessing games ... 
ATLEY JACKSON (cont'd) Calitri, man. Raymond "The Carpenter" Calitri ... Your favorite and mine ... 
Which means nothing to us ... Though the look on Memphis, face speaks volumes ... 
ATLEY JACKSON (cont'd) I just thought you should know, man. I kind of had a feeling you didn't. But I should tell you: I'm working for him now - The Carpenter - so if you see him, you won't mention me coming to get you... Like I said: I just thought ... I owed you ... And that it was the right thing to do ... 
Memphis nods ... His face clenched in despair. We FADE TO BLACK, As a SUPER on-screen reads: PART 1: STOLEN MOMENTS 
We PRE-LAP J. Geils Band's "Hard-Drivin' Man" and CUT TO: 
THREE PLATES OF BACON, EGGS AND HASH BROWNS 
placed on the service deck by a short-order COOK... 
INT. RUBY'S ALL-NITE - LONG BEACH - NIGHT 
A 24-hour diner in the heart of Long Beach... The three plates are picked-up with an impressive dexterity by 
HELEN RAINES 
early 60s, clear-eyed... In pink Ruby's uniform and chunky shoes... Black currant hair striated with wisps of gray... Helen delivers the plates to a booth of college kids ... 
KID Can I get some more coffee -- ? 
HELEN RAINES Sure, hon ... 
And she goes to the coffee station... When 
MEMPHIS (O.S.) Who's a guy gotta know to get a tuna melt in this joint -- ? 
And she turns around to see Memphis standing there. Her expression displays many things ... Most of them joy ... 
MEMPHIS (cont'd) Hello, Ma -- 
And she goes to Memphis ... Wraps her arms around him ... Squeezes tight ... 
HELEN RAINES (cont'd) Oh, Randall ... 
She takes his head in her hands ... Kisses his cheek ... Then the other... Hugs on ... Unmindful of the customers ... The cook smiles from behind the order wheel ... 
COOK What's the word, Memphis -- ? 
MEMPHIS How ya doing, Ruby -- ? 
HELEN RAINES Come, come, come ... 
And she leads him over to a booth ... Barking to the cook - RUBY - on the way... 
HELEN RAINES (cont'd) Tuna melt on pumpernickel.  Provolone, extra tomato, Dijon... And a chocolate milk... Lots of syrup... (to Memphis) Right? 
MEMPHIS Right ... 
And they settle in ... Across the booth from each other ... She takes his hands... 
HELEN RAINES You look good... 
MEMPHIS You, too, Ma... 
HELEN RAINES What are you doing back? 
MEMPHIS How's Kip? 
And Helen flushes, a bit ashamed maybe ... 
HELEN RAINES Have you seen him? 
MEMPHIS No. 
HELEN RAINES oh. 
MEMPHIS Atley Jackson came to see me ... 
Hold the stare... The others are excited... 
FREB What are you doing back, Memphis? 
MEMPHIS Little visit. Check on the family. 
KIP It's nice to see ya, man - 
He smiles ... Memphis eyeballs him... Toby is there ... 
TOBY Hey, Memphis. Remember me? Toby Walker. I live next door ... 
MEMPHIS Sure. Hey, Toby. You grew up 
TOBY Yeah, I'm cool ... 
And Memphis turns back to Kip, who's picked up a pool cue. 
KIP Who's got next game -- ? 
And he makes to rack 'em up ... Then: 
MIRROR MAN I get it. You ain't gotta be a genius: Memphis come back to save our bacon! 
TUMBLER Shut-up, Mirror Man -- 
FREB Izzat true? You come back to save our bacon? 
MIRROR MAN Of course it's true. He come to save his brother's dangling ass -- 
KIP That can't be it. Cos we don't need saving 
FREB We don't -- ? 
MEMPHIS He give you an advance -- ? 
MIRROR MAN Hell, yeah. Ten larger man 
Kip shoots him a look... As if he's spoken out of turn ... 
MEMPHIS You just give 'im back the money. All's well... 
The others look glum... Kip laughs ... Long and hard... 
KIP "Give lim back the money." "Give 'im back the money..." Be nice. If only we didn't drink the money. And smoke the money. And buy Nikes with the money. And Sony Play Stations with the money. And dirty girls with the money... 
And Kip sinks a ball ... Memphis looks at the others ... They nod... It's true ... The money's gone ... 
KIP But don't worry, man. Things are all sweetness and light here... 
TUMBLER Things are all leafy and suburban ... 
MIRROR MAN The hell they are -- 
KIP Sure they are. Although we do appreciate the gesture, Memphis. But we do got it handled... And it was nice to see you -- - 
Memphis nods ... Looks at all of them... Smiles ... And then REACHES OUT, GRABBING Kip by the collar, yanking him to his feet and in close, nose to nose ... 
MEMPHIS You listen to me, baby brother. You fancy yourself some reat neat tough guy scumbum, well, woop-tee-doo, little puppy with a poundcake. But I remember the days when you used to steal my Colorforms and eat 'em... So you can't stop me from saving your "dangling ass' if that's what I feel like doing... 
And with that, he shoves Kip back down into his seat, toppling the table, bottles and glasses crashing... And barrels away from them, the crowd parting like a wound... 
Kip's crew left stunned, flustered, and maybe a bit impressed... 
TUMBLER Damn... Homeboy's on the dazzle ... 
And, off of Kip's furious look, we CUT TO: 
EXT. LONG BEACH HARBOR - NIGHT 
A chill in the air. Memphis walks toward a range of lowslung buildings ... 
EXT. WOODBURN SCRAP AND METAL - NIGHT 
A virtual cityscape of dismantled automobile carcasses, piled up high for as far as the eye can see ... A huge FORK LIFT scoops up a wreck and hauls it over to the CRUSHER... Watch as the car is FLATTENED, for easy shelving ... 
Midnight auto nonpareil ... To one side of the yard is a GARAGE: Watch as a HONDA ACCORD, with a BLOODY WINDSHIELD, enters the garage. A young Mexican KID driving. 
A SIGN: "LOCK YOUR CAR OR IT MAY BE GONE IN 60 SECONDS!" 
INT. GARAGE - CHOP SHOP 
A CAR is CHOPPED ... Pulled apart ... Fenders, doors, panels, interiors, air bags ... 
EXT. WOODBURN SCRAP AND METAL - FRONT ENTRANCE 
Memphis knocks on the door ... A dog-faced MAN opens it ... 
DOG-FACE Yeah -- ? 
MEMPHIS Randall Raines to see Mr. Calitri ... 
INT. WOODBURN SCRAP AND METAL 
Memphis follows Dog-face to the back of this building. Follows him into another room. Which is 
A WORKSHOP 
An enormous WOODWORKING SHOP, fully tricked-out with state-of-the- art table saws and drill presses, jointers and power planes. 
An antique treadle lathe stands in one corner. A stock layout of expensive woods - oak, birch, maple, cherry, mahogany - is stacked against the rear wall ... 
Jars and bottles and cakes of glues, resins, stains and bleaches cram a shelf unit ... There's a MAN here, at a band saw. This is RAYMOND CALITRI, 59 ... 
He wears an apron, protective glasses and a lopsided sneer. A Richard Widmark motherfucker - with the diamond hard look of a cobra. The liegelord of downtown... 
CALITRI I knew you'd say that, too -- 
Calitri smiles ... Memphis 'looks at him... At Atley Realizing the trap ... 
MEMPHIS Sound it out for me. 
CALITRI Your brother has four days. Fifty cars. Five-zero. For that he gets 200 large ... 
MEMPHIS And if he doesn't make it -- ? 
Calitri goes to one corner of the shop... Takes a tarp off of a full couch MAHOGANY CASKET... 
CALITRI I made this, too. My first one. Brass extension handles, not plated. The coverings are silk, not rayon. Expensive hardwood. And lined with spray green Lorraine crepe ... 
Memphis waits, knowing where this is going -- 
CALITRI (cont'd) Yes, yes. I made it for young Kip. In case he fails. At 8:00 Friday morning, if that ship sets off without my fifty ... Kip will take up permanent residence in this box ... 
Calitri WALL SWITCH and the a corrugated steel SLIDING DOOR is RAISED, revealing a LOADING DOCK facing the back of the yard... Two MEN are working out there... DIGGER AND BUTZ scuzzy dudes, mid-30s and dressed in dirty coveralls ... 
CALITRI (cont'd) Come here for a second, boys -- 
And they come over -- 
DIGGER Evenin', Mr. C. -- 
CALITRI Digger, Butz: let me introduce you to Randall Raines. Used to head up the dandiest ring in Southern Cal. Left us for parts unknown. Randall, this is Digger. And that's Butz - 
DIGGER Hi, Randall -- 
Memphis says nothing. Calitri grins ... Nods to Digger an Butz, who go back to work... 
CALITRI Digger and Butz will be in charge of burial. They're good boys ... 
Memphis' look is cold and furious ... Plaintive: 
MEMPHIS I don't want them hurt. Any of 'em... 
CALITRI "don't want" the Dodgers to lose or the summer to end. But we don't get to choose these things... 
Atley hits the wall-switch and the steel door slides shut. Calitri turns to Memphis... 
CALITRI (cont'd) "Nothing that's forced can ever be right." Old woodworking expression. I really don't care how the 50 get onto my ship ... I just care that they do. You decide. 
With that, he puts his protective glasses back on - and fires up an abrasive-disc-finishing machine, adjusting the miter gage and beginning to sand the Outside curve of an angled chamfer. 
EXT. HELEN RAINES' HOUSE - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT 
A small New England-style shingle and clapboard, up on a hill overlooking the port. A small GUEST-HOUSE behind it ... 
INT. HELEN RAINES' HOUSE 
Helen clears away the dinner dishes ... The TV is on. The news. We see a CRIME SCENE ... 
REPORTER ... the car-jacking, which left Ramona Sullivan, the 44-year-old mother of three, dead, occurred last night at ... 
Memphis glances to the TV... Grimaces ... He looks out the window ... At the SEDAN parked below... 
EXT. RAINES' HOUSE - NIGHT 
Memphis comes out ... Moves to the sedan parked across the street ... it is Detectives Castlebeck and Drycoff... 
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK I know you. 
MEMPHIS You know my back. 
They get out of the car... The view of San Pedro from up here is a spectacular bedspread of lights ... 
DETECTIVE DRYCOFF When'd you get to town, Raines? 
MEMPHIS The other day.... 
DETECTIVE DRYCOFF What for? 
MEMPHIS No particular reason. Catch a Laker game. I heard we got Shaquille ... 
DETECTIVE DRYCOFF Where you been, anyway? 
MEMPHIS Just out there. Roaming around. Building up my collection of refrigerator magnets ... 
DETECTIVE DRYCOFF You seem a little hinked-up ... 
MEMPHIS Not at all ... 
He and Castlebeck lock eyes ... Castlebeck takes a pear from his coat pocket ... Sets to polishing it ... 
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK I remember us having made some kind of deal, Randall. I don't remember this deal having some kind of time-limit. I look at you - here - in my town - and I'm confused... 
MEMPHIS A little family emergency -- 
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK I hope it's not your dear sweet mother... 
MEMPHIS No... 
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK Or your baby brother. What was his name? 
MEMPHIS Kip. 
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK Yes, Kip. Short for Kipling. Named for the English writer of stories about India ... He bites into his pear ... Memphis says nothing, waits ... 
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK (cont'd) I got a rash of thefts.  A new crew is making noise. We recovered a big take - last week... 
MEMPHIS And this has what to do with me? 
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK I don't know. But you shouldn't be here. Take care of your business. I'll give you 24 hours. And then I don't want to see your face. Ever again. Make a fool of me once, that's my bad. Make a fool of me twice. That's really my bad, and I'll kick your ass from here to India ... 
KIP Yeah ... 
MEMPHIS You all right -- ? 
KIP I think so. There's things I can't feel right now. Like my feet. But ... You think you can get me outta this, Memphis? I'd appreciate it - 
MEMPHIS Just hold-on there -- 
Memphis goes to the garage ... Finds a crowbar, an acetylene TORCH, tin-snips ... He goes back to the wrecked car... And sets to work... He looks at Kip ... Shakes his head... 
MEMPHIS (cont'd) So you want to run that part by me again about things being "all sweetness and light..." 
KIP This has nothing to do with any of that -- 
MEMPHIS Oh. You maybe have more than one enemy who owns a car-crusher -- ? 
KIP All my enemies own car crushers. It's like a pre-requisite ... Owwww... 
MEMPHIS Easy ... Take it easy ... We're almost there... 
Indeed... Memphis has freed him ... Kip crawls from the wreckage ... His clothes in tatters... Blood seeps from a variety of contusions ... He limps ... Memphis helps him to the guest house 
INT. KIP'S GUEST HOUSE - LATER - NIGHT 
Small, cluttered... Posters of Kurt Cobain, a skying Kobe Bryant, Pamela Anderson, two nude girls draped over a glittering Lamborghini Espada, etc. There's a fish tank... And a big-screen TV, on which the Lakers are currently defending a high-speed Boston Celtic fast-break... 
Memphis sits on a ratty couch before the TV... Kip comes out of the bedroom... He's changed clothes ... He wears clunky fur-lined MOON BOOTS, leopard-skin Speedos and a tshirt ... He looks slightly ridiculous... 
Throughout the scene, Memphis should be studying Kip, as if he's seeing him for the very first time ... And waiting for the inevitable crack... 
MEMPHIS You okay -- ? 
KIP Totally. I'm fine. You want a beer, man -- ? 
MEMPHIS Sure -- 
And Kip limps toward the refrigerator ... He comes back with two beers ... Hands one to Memphis ... Glances at the TV -- 
KIP you like Kobe's game? I do. You think he's heir apparent to MJ? I do. He speaks fluent Italian, you know? So he's got that going for him -- 
And a cut on Kip's forehead starts to bleed ... Kip grabs a towel ... Presses it to his head -- 
MEMPHIS You sure you're okay -- ? 
KIP Yeah, man. Where is your beer? 
Memphis holds it up ... Kip nods ... There are a pile of IGNITIONS on the table ... Kip picks one up, absently begins trying to strip it... 
KIP Cool. So you're living up North? 
MEMPHIS Yeah - 
KIP I heard you were pumping gas - 
MEMPHIS Something like that - 
KIP You're kind of cultivating a new look. 
MEMPHIS Yeah -- 
Beat ... They watch the game ... Kip replaces the soaked towel with another ... 
MEMPHIS (cont'd) Maybe you need a stitch -- 
KIP Nah. It's a scratch. 
MEMPHIS Okay -- 
Beat ... 
KIP Hey, you want something to eat ? 
MEMPHIS What do you got ... ? 
And Kip hoists himself painfully to his feet ... Limps over to the 'fridge ... Memphis watches him, a slight grin at Kip's attempt at cool ... Kip peers into the 'fridge ... 
KIP Not much. I got olives. You like olives? Kalamata olives rule, I think. Ma likes the Calabrese. It's more mellow 
And he brings over a bowl of olives. 
MEMPHIS There's certainly a time and a place for a mellow olive - 
KIP Yeah, yeah. That's what I'm thinking -- 
And they nibble on them. Kip bites into one ... And the juice stings his cracked lip ... But he disguises his grimace as an appreciative nod... 
And for a moment, they nibble olives and drop pits into an ashtray... Then: 
MEMPHIS So what are you gonna do? 
KIP About what? 
MEMPHIS "About what?" 
KIP About Calitri? No worries, man. I'll call him. He's a reasonable dude ... 
MEMPHIS I can see that - 
And Memphis glances out the window. To the crushed car. Kip catches the glance, glances himself, chooses to ignore it. 
MEMPHIS (cont'd) You have everything ... under control? 
KIP Yeah. He just wants to know I'm still on it. He needs reassurance. All these big swinging dicks do. No worries. I won't let him get into our Kool-Aid... 
Kip shrugs ... Picks up another olive... Remembers the pain' of the last one... Drops it back in the bowl ... Memphis is staring at him, disgusted... Kip feels it ... 
MEMPHIS Yeah Tell him to lay off Kip and them Tell him it's on 
Atley nods... 
ATLEY JACKSON Any idea how you're gonna go at it? 
Memphis looks at him... Shakes his head... FADE TO BLACK. 
As a SUPER on-screen reads: PART II - BACK TO WRONG 
EXT. OTTO'S AUTO - NIGHT 
The hustle and bustle of a full-service auto restoration operation ... 
Dig the 157 Chevy, as an orange diamond tuck and roll with orange fur interior is installed... Dig the 153 Corvette as its front and rear suspension is replaced with coils and airshocks ... Dig the 150 Merc, as its chrome is stripped off and the old paint sandblasted and holes brazed... 
All under the watchful eye of... 
OTTO HALLIWELL 
Late 60s. A feisty grease-soaked curmudgeon who begs the question: how the hell did they manage to rock together Yoda and the ghost of Walter Huston... ? 
But he remains the Zen master of cars and all that cars are, were and can be ... 
His mixed-breed MUTT - Hemi - licks his balls in one corner 
Otto is currently AIRBRUSHING a candy-colored, variegated DESIGN on the deck lid of a Camaro ... It is painstaking work ... But he is an artist ... 
His woman - JUNIE - a tall blonde, early 40s, body of a thousand dances, wipes his brow, like a scrub nurse ... 
Memphis wanders in... 
Otto sees Memphis ... Drops his brush... He walks over to Memphis ... Takes him in his arms ... Hugs him close... Actually waltzes him a few steps ... 
Memphis is stunned at the transformation this place has gone through ... 
OTTO Am I dying? Are all the angels of my life returning to bid a final farewell? (holds him at arm's length) And have my angels completely lost their fashion sense -- ? MEMPHIS Hello, Otto ... 
OTTO You remember Junie? 
MEMPHIS Of course. Hi, Junie -- 
JUNIE Hello, Memphis - 
MEMPHIS What happened here -- ? 
OTTO Whatever do you mean? 
MEMPHIS The chop-shop... Where are the stripped cars?  The rolled-back odometers? The part bins? 
OTTO What happened? Old-age happened. I tired of killing them. I woke up one morning and thought I am no longer a destroyer. I am a means of resurrection. Now. We restore. We revive. There are so few things in this life, we can prevent from decay. Most must die. These don't have to... 
He calls over to the MEXICAN MAN working on the pick-up ... 
OTTO (cont'd) It's 3 coats of primer, 12 coats of black acrylic lacquer before laying out the flames ... And fill the cab top with mylar flakes ... They'll sparkle like stars ... (turns to Memphis) Randall, Randall, Randall ... You look splendid ... 
MEMPHIS You, too, Otto 
And Otto goes back to the Camaro ... To finish his work... 
OTTO I heard rumors you were back. About Kip ... 
MEMPHIS He's gotten involved -- 
Otto looks up frustrated... To Junie 
OTTO (O.S.) I can't concentrate. Play something, my sweetness; my reason to rise ... 
And Junie hits PLAY on a cassette deck ... And, instantly, ENGINE SOUNDS rip from the shop's stereo speakers ... Otto listens, as if it were a Mahler symphony... 
OTTO (cont'd) The Ferrari 365 GTB/4 Daytona. At Le Mans. 1971. The quad-cam V12. Hear how they got the engine up? Hear those exhaust notes? That's a very wide rev range... Here, it peaks at 5500 RPM... 
Memphis smiles ... These eccentricities are old hat... 
OTTO (cont'd) Raymond Calitri. He's amplified much sorrow on these streets ... 
MEMPHIS You think it can be done? 
OTTO Are you considering a comeback tour? 
MEMPHIS Tell me... 
OTTO It can be done. Take two days to shop; one to prep. I'll offer up my bible for a small fee. You also have to hope Kip's jerk-circus didn't undo Castlebeck's linkage so much so that he's setting up surveillance teams on every city block. And then get yourself a crew... 
MEMPHIS The hard part ... 
OTTO "A people is a detour of nature to get 6 or 7 great men - Yes, and then to get around them..." Nietzsche said that. 
MEMPHIS Is he still working here ? 
OTTO The old crew. Go find them. I can't help you with that. Since I've cleaned up the act a bit, they no longer come around... A pity how legitimacy makes you unpopular - 
MEMPHIS I Just don't know how happy they'll be to see me 
Otto has finished the Camaro ... He looks at Memphis -- 
OTTO I remember I had a 1964 Buick Opal. worst car ever built. Value job. Everything broke and I-fixed it. A coma car - built to German specs. Plastic gas line. 3 speedometer head. On a quiet night, you could hear it rusting in the garage. But when that car was gone, I missed it. If it came driving back in here right now, there'd be tears and laughter ... 
MEMPHIS And the moral of that story is -- ? 
OTTO Go to them. They'll be happy to see you ... Ahhh... 
And he closes his eyes ... To listen to the Ferrari tape ... 
OTTO (cont'd) ... 8.8:1 compression... 
Memphis considers ... He has little choice ... 
MEMPHIS We do this. Then. You're finished. Then. You're clean 
KIP I like how you wallop back in here - after four years - and can still get all Clifford Huxtable on my shit ... 
MEMPHIS You hear me? 
KIP I hear ya. Get me outta this. I'll move to the country. Open a fruit stand... 
Memphis looks at him... Shakes his head... 
DONNY ASTRICKY You guys have any skills at all? 
KIP Hell, yeah. Mirror Man here is our electronics expert. He's got some gadgets you old farts maybe never -heard of; Tumbler can drive anything with wheels, and some things without; Toby's a hacker, can do things with a computer, that are pretty amazing ... 
MEMPHIS How old are you now, Toby? 
TOBY Sixteen. But my birthday's in seven months ... 
Memphis shakes his head... Sighs ... 
DONNY ASTRICKY (re: Freb) What about him? 
KIP Freb can order pizzas like nobody's business 
Freb starts to Protest ... Shrugs ... 
FREB People gotta eat ... 
Memphis looks at all of them ... Sighs... 
MEMPHIS Okay, then... Otto? 
OTTO In order to succeed, you're going to have to go old-school. one night boost. Put all your nuts in one basket. And... 
TUMBLER One night? Are you nuts? 
MEMPHIS You got maybe a better plan? 
Tumbler looks to Kip... 
KIP You spread it out ... you move around... So's they can't touch you... so's they don't know... Shadow games and shit 
MEMPHIS "Shadow games?" 
KIP Shadow games ... 
MEMPHIS You spread it out, by the 2nd night, the heat are onto you. Know something's up. With a one-night boost, by the time all the cars are reported stolen, your ship's set sail. 
Kip and the others nod... Makes sense ... 
MEMPHIS (cont'd) Go on, Otto - 
OTTO We're on a truncated time-table. Take a day to shop it; a day to prep it ... And we're still going to need to expand the crew... 
DONNY ASTRICKY There's no one left ... 
OTTO We've got several Italian cars on the list. Always tricky, always timeconsuming. So we're gonna need a specialist ... 
Memphis looks at him. Because that's what he was afraid of. 
MIRROR MAN (to Otto) You know of one -- ? 
MEMPHIS Yeah. He's knows of one all right. 
So we'll PRE-LAP The Beach Boys' "409" and CUT TO: 
INT. "THE NAUTICAL MILE" SALOON - NIGHT 
A SHOT GLASS, slammed down on a bar by a surly DRUNK... In a mariner saloon. Drunken SAILORS and FISHERMAN and NAVY TYPES. Sawdust on the floor. Broken beer mirrors. A rough joint... 
DRUNK One more, girl - 
The BARTENDER comes over.. . She is a dark-haired, heavily tattooed GIRL, 26, with the faded blue world-weariness of Roy Orbison song... Her name is Sara Wayland... And she goes by SWAY. She collects the Drunk's empty glass... 
SWAY I think you've had enough, Billy... 
DRUNK Enough? I haven't even started, girl. Gimme another -- 
SWAY If you leave now, Billy, you can get a head-start on waking up in a pool of your own vomit... 
DRUNK Listen, you little cooze-- 
And the Drunk reaches out across the bar, to grab a bottle And Sway grabs his hand, twists it ... The Drunk groans in agony ... And Sway, still clutching his hand, hops over the bar ... And drags the drunk by his twisted hand to the front ... Cries of "Attagirl, Sway!" pepper the air ... 
EXT. "THE NAUTICAL MILE" - NIGHT 
Sway tosses him... The Drunk hitting the pavement ... 
SWAY Come back when you've learned how to drink, Billy -- 
And she freezes ... Because standing there, is Memphis ... She looks at him ... Shocked is a good place to start ... 
MEMPHIS See you're still stealing the sailors from the sea -- 
SWAY What are you doing here? 
And she heads back inside ... And he follows her... 
INT. "THE NAUTICAL MILE" 
They head toward the bar... 
SWAY (re: his clothes) What's with the look? 
And Memphis releases him... And Mitch goes down hard ... And Sway comes over ... 
SWAY What the hell are you doing -- ? 
MEMPHIS If you change your mind. We're at Otto's. It's 50 ladies in 24 hours. For The Carpenter. 200 K and Kip's life on the felt. So long now ... 
And he's out of there, before Mitch's PALS can get to him. 
MITCH Who was that guy, Sara? 
She looks at the door ... Shrugs ... 
SWAY Good question ... 
INT. OTTO'S AUTO - LATER - NIGHT 
Memphis, Kip, Donny, Mirror Man and Otto sit around the garage ... Going through the list ... Tumbler calls from the next room: 
TUMBLER Freb's here. Open the gate. 
DONNY ASTRICKY (to Otto) We sent him out on a solo boost. See what he could do ... 
Freb pulls in an '89 Cadillac Coupe De Ville ... 
FREB How do I look in this one? 
MIRROR MAN Like a goofy white boy in a Cadillac. 
DONNY ASTRICKY How'd it go? 
FREB Keys were in it ... 
DONNY ASTRICKY Well, that defies the point, don't it? 
MIRROR MAN You should ask him how he got the name "Freb." 
FREB Shaddup, man ... 
DONNY ASTRICKY Get the damn thing in there and get it cleaned up - 
Freb pulls in. Pops the trunk. The gate is closed. 
KIP This is loaded with crap - get a duffel. 
He pulls out a set of golf clubs ... Freb brings over a duffel ... Mirror Man plucks something from the trunk ... 
MIRROR MAN (cont'd) Holy shit ... 
It's a plasticine BAG - full of a WHITE POWDER... 
DONNY ASTRICKY Lemme see that - 
He pierces the skin.. Tastes ... 
DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd) Heroin. 
KIP No shit? 
And they pull back the trunk tarp ... And there are perhaps TWO DOZEN similar smack-filled BAGS ... 
DONNY ASTRICKY There's gotta be a million bucks worth here - 
TUMBLER We're rich. Goddamn, we're rich! 
MEMPHIS Where'd you pick her up? 
FREB In front of one of them poker parlors in Chinatown ... 
MEMPHIS Well, take it back -- 
KIP Take it back? What do you mean take it back? Are you crazy, man? 
MEMPHIS Take it back, Freb -- 
MIRROR MAN Hey, now, Memphis... C'mon, man - 
Donny makes to grab the bag from Mirror Man ... But Mirror Man holds on ... They tug back and forth ... The bag DROPS ... Splitting on the ground, behind the car. Spilling heroin. 
MIRROR MAN (cont'd) Now, see what you-- 
But a BANG! BANG! on the front gate, gives them all pause. 
OTTO Who is it -- ? 
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK (O.S.) Castlebeck. 
DONNY ASTRICKY Jesus. The whole damn thing's loaded. 
OTTO one minute -- ! 
And the others scatter into the back office, with their tools and devices and lists. Leaving only Memphis and Otto. 
Memphis picks up the broken bag ... Sticks it in the trunk ... Puts the golf clubs in on top of it ... Slams the trunk. Only there's still a neat MOUNTAIN OF SMACK ON THE FLOOR by the rear of the Caddy ... But there's no time... 
For the gate is opened. Detective Castlebeck ambles in. 
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK I know you. 
MEMPHIS You know my back. 
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK What are you still doing here, Randall? 
MEMPHIS Stopped by to see Otto. Say hello. 
Castlebeck looks at Otto... Otto grins... Castlebeck walks around the garage... Taking it all in... 
Memphis and Helen look at him... Then: 
MEMPHIS After he died ... I think that's what I missed most of all ... That there was no different cars every night ... When I started hanging around Otto's ... And he started showing me the things ... It was a way to kill two birds ... Put food on the table for you and Kip ... And ... Ride in different cars every night ... Just like when Dad was here. 
Tears stand in Helen's eyes ... Kip gets to his feet ... 
KIP Ancient history's two things. "Ancient." And "history!" 
And he walks out of the house, door slamming behind him. Memphis turns to his mother ... 
MEMPHIS (cont'd) We're gonna have to do this thing, Ma. 
HELEN RAINES I know... 
MEMPHIS We do it. He'll get clear Once and for all 
And she nods ... 
ANGLE - A PHOTO. Robert Raines. Smiling beside an Olds 98. 
EXT. INTERNATIONAL TOWERS HIGH RISE CONDOS - DAY 
The garage door opens as a resident drives out ... And Memphis and Donny and Kip and Toby enter the garage ... They walk along the rows of parked cars ... Searching ... 
DONNY ASTRICKY Car-jacking is the lazy man's boost. No skill. No finesse. Can only take the car if the key is in it. That's not thieving. That's parking ... Thugs ... With the decency of dirt ... 
TOBY They're just cars, man ... 
To prevent Donny from biting the kid's head off, Memphis chimes in with: 
MEMPHIS This Eleanor's been living at the International Towers for 3 years now. 
TOBY Who's "Eleanor?" 
MEMPHIS The 167 Mustang Shelby Mustang GT-500. 
TOBY Why do you call it "Eleanor?" 
MEMPHIS All the vehicles get code names. Female names. You say "Eleanor lives at such and such... " and no one listening on the waves is the wiser ... 
DONNY ASTRICKY Eleanor is Memphis' "unicorn." 
MEMPHIS And there she is -- 
Indeed, slotted nearby is a '67 SHELBY MUSTANG GT-500 Silver with black top ... 
MEMPHIS (cont'd) Hello, Eleanor -- 
And he looks at her. An old friend he hasn't seen in years. 
TOBY It looks just like a regular Mustang -- 
KIP Don't go there, Toby -- 
MEMPHIS She's not. Carroll Shelby tweaked the Mustang's High-Performance 289 engine and got it legally rated for the street at 450 horsepower ... But its actual output is closer to 600 ... 
TOBY So she flies - 
MEMPHIS She soars - 
DONNY ASTRICKY Grade-A unicorn ... 
TOBY What's a "unicorn?" 
DONNY ASTRICKY Fabled creature. You know - the horse with the horn? Impossible to capture? 
Toby looks blank ... 
DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd) We all got one. The single car that, no matter how many times you try to boost, something happens... Cops show up, car doesn't start, owner comes back. It's voodoo... 
TOBY You guys and the car thing, man -- 
They head off ... Memphis turns back to the Shelby 
MEMPHIS See you in a few days, Eleanor -- 
INT. OTTO'S AUTO - BACK ROOM - DAY 
To Queen's "I'm In Love With My Car." The crew is at work, a MAZDA and a CADDY are parked here for practice: Tumbler is modifying a series of slim jims, based on the type of cars they'll be after 
Donny and Freb are in the Caddy, Freb behind the wheel Tumbler puts together BRIEFCASES, containing the requisite TOOLS: slim- jim, gizmo, screwdriver, ratchet, dent-puller, a mini-battery with pointy leads ... 
- Mirror Man is showing off one of his GADGETS - beepersized DEVICE - to Otto... They stand before a locked MAZDA. 
MIRROR MAN And you just stick it in the lock. Hit this little button ... And ... 
He does ... The door UNLOCKS ... The car's ALARM gives a weak chirp and dies... Otto looks at Donny ... 
OTTO We're dinosaurs, Donny. Pull-up a tar pit ... (to Mirror Man) Can I try -- ? 
MIRROR MAN Knock yourself out -- 
Kip and Memphis are with Toby, who has his laptop out ... 
TOBY I logged outside the G.R.A.B. site, right? Then I monitored their incoming outside data requests, right? Then I got these ISDN numbers, right? Then I tracked them back, right? Then I took the one I could jack-up the easiest, right? Then I called back see, they think I'm an insurance company - that's where it looks like I'm coming from -- and they're sharing stats with this insurance company, right? So now they're sharing it with me, right? They think I'm looking for stats for an actuarial conference on auto-theft. So they let me in, right? Give me all these numbers. But then I don't leave, right? I'm in. I've got the key. Now I just go anywhere I want. 
MEMPHIS So what's in there -- ? 
TOBY I can tell you who's gonna be on duty tonight. I can tell you how much gas they're using monthly. I can tell you how they used to spend that annoying half-hour between "FRIENDS" and "SEINFELD"... 
Memphis nods ... Fairly impressed... 
KIP Good work, Toby -- 
Donny and Freb are inside the Caddy ... Freb's attempts to start it fail... 
Yes, it's the requisite rock-to-an-oldie bit ... But God, it's fun. As they exorcise some pre-boost jitters.  Only Kip stands aside from the frolic ... We watch them dance and laugh and sing for a bit ... 
And then Atley Jackson is there. And behind him, another Calitri GOON... And, finally, Calitri himself stands there. Someone kills the music. They all look at him... Donny and The Sphinx nod to Atley ... 
CALITRI This is how you're spending my time? Having a sock hop? 
MEMPHIS Everyone know Ray Calitri? Pillar of the community ... 
CALITRI Look at this. A multi-generational gathering of scumbags ... 
OTTO So saith the God of Scumbags -- 
CALITRI Hello, Otto. My boys at the dock report no cars have yet to be delivered. And there's only one more night ... 
OTTO Getting nervous, Ray? What happens to you, I wonder, if delivery isn't made? 
Calitri ignores him... Looks at Kip ... 
CALITRI With all the free time I've had not counting cars as they're loaded onto my ship, I've managed to sand the cedar inside your box, Kip. This will protect you from the anaerobic bacteria, that normally thrives in an airless; environment. Thus prolonging decay ... 
He smiles ... And Kip actually makes a run for him... Only to be held back by Tumbler and Donny ... 
MEMPHIS Get out of here, Ray -- 
CALITRI One more night -- 
MEMPHIS Get out -- 
CALITRI I hope you know what you're doing. God help you if you don't ... 
And with that, he leaves, his goons following. Leaving our 
crew to stare after him ... And then we FADE TO BLACK... 
As a SUPER on-screen reads PART III: SWITCHIN'-TO-GLIDE 
INT. HELEN RAINES' HOUSE - GARAGE - DAY 
As Memphis goes through some old boxes. At last, he finds what he's looking for ... Opens it ... He takes out its contents ... His tools, which we remember from the opening ... And then... CLOTHING ... 
EXT. OTTO'S - DAY 
Drycoff and Hawkings wait in their unmarked ... 
DRYCOFF Oh, this is a good time -- 
He lights another cigarette ... The ashtray is overflowing. 
HAWKINGS How much can one man smoke? 
DRYCOFF It's a crime, ain't it? Cos Castlebeck's got a bug up his ass over this guy, I gotta get lung cancer ... 
INT. OTTO'S 
Mirror Man and Tumbler are at the window Memphis brought them to last night ... Mirror Man has a RADIO TRANSMITTER in his hand... Donny comes by ... 
DONNY What are you doing? 
TUMBLER Watch and learn, old-timer -- 
As Mirror Man points the antennae out the window ... A TOY CAR - a 1970 HEMI 'CUDA replica ... Radio-operated, the car speeds along the curb outside, using parked cars as cover... She really cooks... 
DONNY The hell are you doing? 
MIRROR MAN Delivering ordnance. Y2K-style. 
ANGLE - THE 'CUDA. As it cruises along. Is stopped by a discarded 40 oz. empty... But Mirror Man maneuvers and its back on track ... At last, parking jammed up to the front, right tire of DRYCOFF AND HAWKINGS' UNMARKED. 
TUMBLER The Hemi Has Landed -- 
DONNY Big deal. Now what? 
MIRROR MAN What we call: fun and shit. 
And he hits a button on his radio control ... ANGLE - the model 'Cuda. Wedged in front of the tire. As a quartet of thin steel, razor-tipped SPIKES thrust out from the Shaker hood ... A fraction away from the tire's skin ... Mirror Man and Tumbler appear satisfied ... 
TUMBLER We can go now -- 
INT. JUDGE CROFT'S GLASS HOUSE - DAY 
The one with the Roadster in the living room... The phone RINGS. The answering machine picks up ... Beeep! 
VOICE (O.S.) Yes, this is a message for Mr. Seymour Croft, of 1443 Locklin ... This is the Department of Water and Power and we're going to be doing some work in your area tonight ... If you'd please call us at 555-1877, so we could discuss the...

TOBY Department of Water and Power. Could you hold please ... 
And before the Judge can respond, they've clicked him on hold... And they make him wait ... And wait ... Just like the real D.W.P. does ... They high-five... 
TOBY (cont'd) Where should we put him? 
KIP He's a Judge. He'll only bite for something pimpy - 
At last, Toby answers ... 
And off they go ... 
INT. SAN PEDRO WAREHOUSE 
Sway sets to prepping the cars ... The others wait nearby. Memphis walks over to where Kip sits ... 
MEMPHIS You okay -- ? 
KIP I'm cool. 
Memphis looks at his watch... 
KIP (cont'd) We gonna make it? 
MEMPHIS Too early to tell. Nervous? 
KIP Nah. 
MEMPHIS That's strange. I'm nervous. Donny's nervous. Everyone's nervous. But not you... 
KIP I dunno. Whatever will be will be... 
MEMPHIS That's a good attitude, Kip. For everything but stealing cars ... 
Before Kip can respond, the signature throaty ROAR of Ferrari fills the room, as Sway's got one started -- 
MEMPHIS (cont'd) Showtime -- 
INT. SAN PEDRO WAREHOUSE - QUICK CUTS 
as Sway gets the Ferraris started, her skill readily apparent ... And each man - Kip, Tumbler, Mirror Man, The Sphinx - climb behind the wheel and ROAR OFF...

MEMPHIS (cont'd) Shit. 
The man climbs into the Maserati. Memphis follows...

Lots of high-end cars. Mirror Man and The Sphinx search the rows ... At last coming to - 
MIRROR MAN Gina -- ! 
The 188 Lamborghini Countach... They move for it... Stop ... 
MIRROR MAN (cont'd) Check it -- 
He gettures to the LICENSE PLATE. It reads "SNAKE"... 
MIRROR MAN (cont'd) Oooh. "Snake." Tough guy. "Snake." Homeboy wants you to call him: Snaake-! 
They crack up ... Size her ... 
MIRROR MAN (cont'd) No whistles ... That's weird... 
He shrugs ... They slim-jim her "beetle-wing" articulated door ... Climb in ... The Sphinx starts her up ... Mirror Ma gets in beside him... The seats are sooo low ... 
MIRROR MAN (cont'd) This shit's on point. Check it: 200. 
He gestures to the speedometer ... Calibrated to 200 MPH.. 
MIRROR MAN (cont'd) Halfway there, we switch. I drive. 
The Sphinx shrugs ... And they head out ... 
MIRROR MAN (O.S.) Say goodbye to your ride, Snake... 
EXT. BACK BAY STREET - NIGHT 
Memphis and Sway have followed the Maserati to another building... Idles ... Smokey Robinson's "Cruisin'" croons. 
MEMPHIS What's this guy up to -- ? 
After a beat, a WOMAN comes out ... She gets into the car. 
SWAY It's 1:30 on a Tuesday. Is that any time to pick a girl up for a date? 
The Maserati's lights go off... He's parked... 
SWAY (cont'd) What, are they gonna mack -- ? 
Yeah. The couple start kissing. Memphis checks his watch 
SWAY (cont'd) Maybe she's got a roommate...

INT. OTTO'S 
Junie, Otto's gal, on the telephone... 
SWAY Wrong preposition... 
MEMPHIS Hear you roar ... 
SWAY What about The Club ... ? 
MEMPHIS Let me worry about The Club ... 
SWAY No worries ... 
MEMPHIS I've got you floored... We're off ... Take the curb... Man, can you corner... Know not to get on it ... Momentum shift ... Don't get on those brakes too hard ... Get her up on her tires. Up on her toes. Up ... Up... Up. 
Back arched... A small moan escapes her ... Prince wails ... And Sway has achieved whatever kind of silly climax they aspired to here... She flops back down... Looks at him... 
SWAY You're still quite the boost, Randall Raines ... (he shrugs) Except now I've been chopped, and my parts are in a Honda Prelude being driven to church in South America by some Bolivian consulate's wife ... 
MEMPHIS And Tracy's on the move ... 
Indeed, the girl has gotten out of the Maserati... And the car has rocketed off... Memphis punches the gas,'sending Sway to the floor...

MIRROR MAN What do I do? What do I do? Aw, man. He's gonna swallow my shit whole Let's go to a hospital or something!

MIRROR MAN (cont'd) C'mon, you creepy no-nosed motherfucker. Take me to a hospital! 
Nope. The Sphinx drives on... Into yet another 
DIRECTOR'S CHASE SCENE 
This one even cooler than the last ... And once they've eluded all of the police, The Sphinx pulls over to the side of a DARKENED STREET... 
MIRROR MAN What are you doing? I'm gonna die! 
The Sphinx leans over... And PINCHES THE SNAKE BEHIND THE BACK OF THE HEAD... 
MIRROR MAN (cont'd) You tryin' to make him more mad? 
But, miraculously, the snake RELAXES ITS GRIP on Mirror Man... And slithers off... To the back of the car ... Where it immediately goes back to sleep ... Mirror Man stares at Sphinx, who smiles genially. Then: 
MIRROR MAN (cont'd) I never thought it'd be possible: but your ass just got spookier ... 
EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT 
Freb and Donny Astricky have gotten "Laura", a '99 Bentley started...

DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd) Lazy, disrespectinIf half-assed bully. Any asshole can pull a gun ... 
And he starts to kick at the kid ... Beat at him... 
DONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd) You don't know how to steal a car, do ya? So you gotta take them when there's already a key in them ... And a person in them... Scare people ... Intimidate ... Little freakin' bully ... 
FREB C'mon, Donny... Let's go, man -- 
DONNY ASTRICKY Lazy ... Lazy ... I ask you, Freb: what's the matter with kids today? 
But then - BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! Bullets rip into Donny Astricky in terrifying SLOW-MOTION. He turns ... To see another KID ... Scared... At the edge of the road... Gat held high ... And Donny drops to the pavement ... And the first Jacker gets to his feet... 
Freb goes to Donny... To his splayed-out body ... SIRENS split the night. The jackers run off down the street.

Freb doesn't know what to do... Donny croaks ... 
DETECTIVE DRYCOFF They just brought in Donny Astricky. Shot by a jacker ...

He hands Castlebeck the list. Calitri's 50. Castlebeck notes the last entry... 
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK Let's get out there. And have them run down every 167 Shelby Mustang in the area ... Find out where they're at.

And there she is. "Carol." Obsidian black. In the garage. The garage is open. And THREE KIDS, two boys and a girl. Late teens. They are standing around "Carol"... Drinking beer... Listening to the new Beck album on the car's CD player ... The folks clearly out of town ... 
Well-scrubbed, white suburban children of plenty ... The only crew they've ever run in is J. Crew... From the hedge, Kip, Tumbler and Toby watch the kids ... With equal parts fascination, loathing, envy... And then, the kids go inside... Leaving "Carol" exposed... 
TOBY I got this one... 
And before the others can respond, he moves for her. And she's open... Toby's in ... Butterfly popped - Gizmo in. The others start to get in when ONE OF THE KIDS comes out from the house. He stares at Toby, who freezes mid-boost ... 
KIP (cont'd) (whispered hiss) Get her started, man -- ! 
And Toby does... And slams her in reverse.  And they're off 
INT. WAREHOUSE -LONG BEACH HARBOR - NIGHT 
The group - - Memphis, Sway, Freb, Mirror Man, and The Sphinx - has returned... The final cars loaded onto the ship ... Memphis looks out into the night -- 
MEMPHIS C'mon, Kip - 
EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREETS - "CAROL" - MOVING - NIGHT 
Toby drives them out, Kip shotgun, Tumbler in the back. But the suburbs are confusing. They can't find their way out. 
TOBY Which way's out, man -- ? 
TUMBLER Shit all looks the same here -- 
They drive. Only up ahead, blocking the street, LIGHTS blinding... Are TWO SECURITY PATROL CARS - SECURITY COPS on the strong ... Guns drawn... 
KIP Shit ... 
TUMBLER Run it... 
Toby looks to Kip... 
KIP No... 
TOBY What am I supposed to do? 
Toby pins the gas. Straight at the block... The security cops dive out of the way. Except for one standing tall and FIRING into the windshield... Into Toby... The car swerves. Going off the road. Into a bank of mailboxes. 
As a SUPER on-screen reads: PART IV: DREAMS OF YOU 
EXT. INTERNATIONAL TOWERS - DAWN 
The sun just starting to take all the purple from the night ... 
Detectives Castlebeck and Drycoff are parked across from the towers in their unmarked... 
Sway pulls up a few blocks away ... Memphis has put on a fake moustache, wig, necktie ... 
SWAY You okay -- ? 
MEMPHIS Yeah ... You -- ? 
She nods ... He looks at her ... 
MEMPHIS (cont'd) You should know: walking away from my mother, my brother, this town. Was hard. Walking away from you. Nearly killed me... 
And she smiles sadly ... 
SWAY I know ... 
She takes his hand ... Squeezes it ... 
SWAY (cont'd) Good luck... 
Memphis, now in gray flannel suit, wig and moustache, steps out. As he heads for the Tower garage... 
IN THE UNMARKED

Castlebeck and Drycoff ... 
DETECTIVE DRYCOFF Check it out -- 
He points ... The '67 Mustang appears at the top of the garage ramp ... Brakes ... Waiting for the light ... Castlebeck squints... Raises the binocs ... Tough to tell.. Memphis drifts into the stream of traffic ... 
DETECTIVE DRYCOFF (cont'd) What do you think -- ? 
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK Let's see what he's about -- 
Drycoff hits the lights and sirens ... Memphis sees the car behind him... 
MEMPHIS Shit ... 
And kicks it into gear... 
DETECTIVE DRYCOFF Hey, now -- ! 
He pins it ... And THE RACE IS ON... In the biggest way possible. This is the grand-daddy of chase scenes here, so we won't take the easy way out. We'll actually script it ... Memphis races out onto the busy street, Drycoff on his ass. 
Drycoff pulls up alongside him... So they can see him. But the wig and moustache prevent them from recognizing Memphis ... Other cars suffer from the pursuit ... They go careening into parked cars, storefronts, Harvard Square ... 
Memphis side-swipes Drycoff's car ... Memphis drives down the Memorial Drive OFF-RAMP, against traffic 
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK 1 Baker 11, in pursuit following collision with suspect. Suspect is male, white, 40-45, six feet, 175 pounds, gray hair, gray moustache, dark suit ... T.A.'s have occurred...

INT. LONG BEACH POLICE STATION - DAY 
Two dozen COPS sit in the muster room listening to the dispatch. 
POLICE DISPATCH (O.S.) ... Suspect is headed southbound on Mount Vernon, at Cambridge Street -- 
The cops look at each other. Holy shit! And race for the exit. Because Mt. Vernon and Cambridge is the address of THE LONG BEACH POLICE STATION 
where there are literally 15 POLICE CARS parked out front... And Memphis has just arrived... 
MEMPHIS Shit ... 
Watch the mad scramble as COPS dive into their units... And try to get out of each other's way... Fenders crunch ... Cops curse. Memphis bootlegs - going reverse down the wrong way. Left on Cambridge ... Left onto City Hall Plaza -- 
climb back into their car ... 
DETECTIVE DRYCOFF Who is this friggin' guy -- ? 
CLOSE ON - CASTLEBECK. Because he's got a sick feeling who. 
ELEANOR 
takes an exit ... And speeds on through the with everyone in pursuit ... 
POLICE DISPATCH (O.S.) Attention all units. Road block being set up at the eastern terminus of the Long Beach Harbor Tunnel. Use caution. 
EXT. HARBOR TUNNEL EASTERN TERMINUS 
It's quite a road block. A DOZEN SQUAD CARS. A WOODEN BARRICADE ... The whole shebang... 
EXT. TUNNEL - ELEANOR 
eating asphalt ... Coming to the tunnel's mouth ... To the road block ... Memphis pins her ... ZOOOOOM! Dead-on to the roadblock ... And, at the last moment, as the COPS dive out of the way -- 
Memphis bangs the gear shift into neutral -- And yanks the parking brake -- And the mustang spins on the straight --(and yes, this is exactly like our opening) Screeching spin ... It stops inches from the road block ... 
Beat ... Thirty squad cars stop behind him ... 
POLICE DISPATCH (O.S.) All units. Pursuit has been terminated. Repeat: pursuit has been terminated at Harbor Tunnel Eastern Terminus -- 
Sure it has. Memphis' foot SLAMS ON Eleanor's pedal ... SMASHING THROUGH THE ROADBLOCK... Cars and cops flying ... And the Dispatch guy is getting pissed. 
POLICE DISPATCH (O.S.) Check that, all units. You guessed it. Pursuit has not been terminated. Jesus Christ, will you catch this guy? 
EXT. LONG BEACH BRIDGE 
A huge suspension bridge spanning the harbor ... Except that on the Long Beach side, therehas been a terrible ACCIDENT ... An eleven-car PILE UP ... 
PARAMEDIC This is Rescue 2... We're at a scene of an 11-car collision with multiple injuries, responded to Ladder truck Code 3 ... We'll need back-up and The Jaws of Life... 
Paramedics ... RAMP TRUCKS hauling away wrecked cars ... Fire engines ... Bloodied VICTIMS ... 
EXT. CITY STREETS - ELEANOR 
takes it on through the vast construction underway here ... And here's our money shot: Eleanor. On Route 33. COMING AT US ... Followed by, literally, 20 POLICE-CARS ... Could be just about the coolest fucking thing we've ever seen... But before we have time to gloat: 
POLICE DISPATCH (O.S.) All units. Suspect vehicle has left The Harbor Tunnel roadblock... State Police advises they have a multiple T.A. on the Long Beach Bridge... Accident is unrelated to Long Beach P.D. pursuit... Repeat unrelated to Long Beach P.D. pursuit. The area is closed except to emergency vehicles. Suspect is headed in that direction. Use caution in that area. Repeat: use caution in that area ... 
THE LONG BEACH BRIDGE 
Southbound traffic on the bridge (into Long Beach) is at a stand-still because of the accident... The Northbound side of the bridge is EMPTY... Northbound traffic stopped at the accident ... 
Memphis comes to a stop 100 feet before the accident ... There is no way past it, onto the bridge ... All the cops behind him come to a screeching halt. He is truly trapped. 
DETECTIVE DRYCOFF 
is thrilled ... 
DETECTIVE DRYCOFF Gotcha now, dickhead -- 
But Castlebeck's not so sure ... He sees a possible play... So does 
MEMPHIS 
Heavy sigh... He shuts off the radio ... And there's a strange SILENCE... As everyone waits ... Watches ... 
QUICK CUTS TO -- 
-- Matty In The Morning -- The gang at Otto's -- The Carpenter in his wood shop -- Helen Raines, in front of her TV -- The chopper cops -- Paramedics, cops, injured motorists, fire men -- Castlebeck and Drycoff... BACK TO 
MEMPHIS RAINES AND ELEANOR... 
Another few beats of silence ... Everyone watching ... He punches the gas... Ripping down to the accident site... Heading straight for it ... And we fear he aims to smash the site, maybe further injure the accident victims - 
Not our Memphis ... He's heading straight for 
THE RAMP TRUCK 
parked ass-end toward Long Beach ... Ramp down ... Memphis rockets Eleanor at the ramp truck's ramp... Straight on ... And the ramp LAUNCHES ELEANOR in glorious super-sexy-bloodpumping SLO-MO OVER THE ACCIDENT SITE some thirty feet in the air ... Evel-style ... 
DETECTIVE DRYCOFF You gotta be fucking kidding me -- 
Where she lands in a crippling thud... Onto the EMPTY side of the Long Beach Bridge... Cheers from the gang at Otto's ... The gang at KISS-108 ... Memphis pulls her to a stop... Looks back at the scene ... 
Castlebeck squints ... Trying to see if it's his boy... Memphis switches the radio back on ... Matty has obliged... Wilson Pickett's "Mustang Sallyo ... And Memphis drives over the bridge, the only car going northbound... Memphis rides, daddy, rides ... 
INT. WOODBURN CONSTRUCTION - FRONT OFFICES - DAY 
A half-dozen Calitri SOLDIERS are here, answering phones, playing cards. 
INT. WOODBURN CONSTRUCTION - WORKSHOP 
The sliding door is open. The CASKET for Kip rests to the side ... Calitri uses a router to make a rabbet along the bottom frame of a plywood gossip bench. He senses something and turns to 
THE LOADING DOCK - MEMPHIS 
has driven up in the smashed-to-shit Eleanor ... He climbs up, entering the workshop... Calitri glances to the wallclock: 7:55 AM... 
CALITRI Well, well. You've caused quite a ruckus ... 
MEMPHIS This is number 50. We did it. It's over Where's the money ? 
CALITRI Right there - 
He gestures to a Haliburton case ... Memphis opens it ... There's a lot of cash inside... 
CALITRI (cont'd) 200 K. Just like we said ... 
MEMPHIS You should never have gotten my brother and his friends involved ... 
MEMPHIS You boost her -- ? 
KIP Hell, yeah. She's not my unicorn. 
MEMPHIS Move over ... 
Kip does. Memphis gets behind the wheel. Drives... 
EXT. LONG BEACH BOULEVARD - DAY 
Memphis drives... Kip beside him... 
MEMPHIS You okay -- ? 
KIP I dunno ... I keep thinking about him. 
Memphis nods. But then FLASHING LIGHTS behind them ... An UNMARKED with Code 3 capabilities - lights & sirens ... Memphis considers ... He could make another run ... But the looks at Kip... Enough is enough ... He pulls over ... 
KIP (cont'd) What are you doing? You can outrun him... 
MEMPHIS It's over. The dumb shit is over ... 
The unmarked pulls up behind him... The cop comes over ... It is, of course, Detective Castlebeck. 
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK I know you. 
MEMPHIS You know my back. 
Castlebeck opens his coat... Showing stuffed holster ... 
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK It's finished, Randall. Get out of the car... You, too, kid... 
Memphis starts to get out. When Castleback's RADIO crackles. 
RADIO (O.S.) We have suspect vehicle matching description at the Woodburn Scrap and Metal ... Repeat: the suspect vehicle has just been apprehended at the Woodburn Scrap and Metal, 190 Street and Campanza ... 
Castlebeck frowns, goes to his radio. Memphis looks at Kip. 
KIP I reported it ... 
Memphis is impressed... 
MEMPHIS Not bad 
ANGLE - CASTLEBECK at his car, on the radio ... 
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK Dispatch, what's the license on the suspect vehicle... ? 
RADIO (O.S.) License is California 6-1-4 HSO. Repeat: California. 6-1-4 Henry Sam Ocean. 
And Castlebeck looks at the license on this Eleanor... A vanity plate that says - MY 67 ... 
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK 
And he goes back over to Memphis ... 
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK (cont'd) Looks like we live to fight another round. You're free to go ... 
Memphis can barely believe it. Castlebeck leans down, to Kip: 
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK (cont'd) Your brother's a clever man and a talented thief, Kipling. But as role models go, you should observe the man, not the thief ... 
KIP Yes, sir ... 
Castlebeck sighs... 
MEMPHIS Don't look so glum, Detective. It's a beautiful day, the birds are singing, and there's a container ship on Pier 14, that's guaranteed to bring you glee ... 
Castlebeck nods ... 
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK I want you gone, Randall. Settle your affairs. Make it right with those you love. Hell, take 'em with you. But I want you out of here. Out of here for good this time ... 
MEMPHIS Consider me gone, Detective -- 
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK I'll catch you later, Randall -- 
MEMPHIS Double-meaning intended -- 
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK You betcha -- 
And Memphis races off ... 
EXT. OTTO'S SALVAGE - DAY 
Otto, The Sphinx, Tumbler, Freb and Mirror Man are sipping coffee and eating donuts ... They are exhausted... Memphis and Kip pull up in Eleanor... He hands Otto the briefcase. Otto opens it... All that cash... 
MEMPHIS Split it up. Any word on Donny? 
OTTO He's gonna be okay. Could do a bit. 
MEMPHIS What happened to Sway? 
OTTO She left... 
He nods ... The boys are huddled together... 
MIRROR MAN Poor Toby, man... 
A few beats of silence as they remember; then shockingly: 
THE SPHINX If his premature demise has, in some way, enlightened the rest of you as to the grim finish below the glossy veneer of criminal life, and inspired you to change your ways, then his death carries with it an inherent nobility. And a supreme glory. We should all be so fortunate. You can say 'Poor Toby." I say: "Poor us.." 
They all stare at him, stunned... 
FREB You spoke

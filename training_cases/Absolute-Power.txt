He allows himself to exhale. Then he's busy again, unhooking the computer. His fingers, as always, work quickly, precisely. 
25A   INT. SULLIVAN MANSION - FOYER - NIGHT                        25A 
The foyer as Luther, once again carrying his backpack, moves across it. Behind him, the front door is again shut, the security panel back on, screws all in place. 
It's as if he hadn't been there at all... 
26    INT. SULLIVAN MANSION - STAIRCASE - NIGHT                    26 
Luther walks quickly up -- and here we get a sense of the vast size of the place -- it feels bigger inside than it looked in the moonlight. 
A Van Gogh at the head of the stairs. Luther moves past it, then stops, goes back, studies the painting. It's a late one, when the madness had him and things were sliding away. Very sad. 
Luther looks at it admiringly for another moment -- 
-- then surprisingly he raises his hand,  and for just an instant traces the lines of the painting  in the air, as if trying to figure out how the magic was  done, as if getting ready for his next museum session  -- 
-- then almost grudgingly, he moves on, up toward the third floor. 
27    INT. SULLIVAN MANSION - THIRD-FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT          27 
Here's a Hopper. One of the great ones, filled with an overpowering sense of being alone -- 
-- Luther stares at it almost in awe, whispers "wow," moves on. 
28    INT. SULLIVAN MANSION - HALLWAY - NIGHT                      28 
Luther, walking down the third-floor corridor. 
The corridor walls. No paintings here -- instead we see a series of framed photographs. The first is of a baby girl, the next one of the same child at three. 
We watch the child grow up in these photos.    At ten she is already pretty. At fifteen a stunner. (CONTINUED)

Not a classic beauty by any means, she is turning into, if you will a latter-day Ann-Margret. The kind of girl you ached for in high school. The perfect cheerleader. 
These are pictures, we will come to know, of Christy Sullivan. A high school graduation shot at eighteen, a shot in front of a Burger King at twenty. 
CLOSEUP - WEDDING PHOTOGRAPH                                     * 
Christy, looking just fabulous, is 24 and smiling happily. We can only see her face and the wedding veil here. Now -- 
PULL BACK to reveal -- 
A glorious and expensive white wedding dress.    Christy holds a bouquet of flowers. Breathtaking. 
KEEP PULLING BACK. 
And now we can see the groom. Walter Sullivan. Walter is smiling too, one arm proudly around his lovely bride. 
Walter, it might be noted, is eighty years old. 
Luther, staring at the photo, shakes his head.    Now he moves on. 
29    INT. SULLIVAN MANSION - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT              29 
Luther opens the DOOR. It SQUEAKS. He goes inside, closes the door firmly. Next, he puts his backpack down, takes out a low-power non-glare work light, sets it up. Now he looks around. A huge room, a gigantic canopied bed. 
A nightstand alongside, which contains a small silver clock, three Danielle Steel novels piled neatly one atop the other, several more photos of the happy couple -- 
-- and an antique silver-plated letter opener with a thick leather handle. 
Luther. He studies himself in front of a very large full-length mirror across from the canopied bed. 
Now we realize something -- he isn't studying himself, he's studying the mirror itself. 
He turns, goes to the sitting area where there are chairs and a sofa and a large TV and VCR. 
(CONTINUED)

Three remotes on a side table. Luther carefully picks up the middle one, crosses the room with it, points it at the large mirror, clicks once -- 
-- and the mirror swings silently open. 
A room is revealed. All we can see of it so far is this: There is an armchair in the middle facing where the mirror had been. 
Luther turns back toward the sitting area, the remote held in his hand. 
The side table. Luther puts the remote down -- very carefully. In the exact position it had been. Now he takes a moment, blows on his hands, rubs them together. 
Then -- Luther takes a collapsible duffel bag out of his backpack, moves with the work light into the revealed room -- 
30   INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - VAULT - NIGHT                 30 
Richmond carries a vodka bottle and two tumblers.     He fills them, gives one to her. 
They touch glasses.    Down the hatch.   Tight laughter. 
He looks at her. 
She looks at him.    There's a lot of sexual tension in the air. 
But now he begins looking around, checking things out. She spots this. 
CHRISTY (drunk) It's okay -- I told him I was sick -- anyway, he's gone -- relax... 
He nods then, more at ease.    And he blows her a kiss. 
She catches it -- and now she starts to parade for him. Her body moving very slowly. 
He pours himself another shot, chugs it, watches.     Now -- 
40   INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                      40 
Luther suddenly terrified and we find out why. 
41   INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                             41 
Christy, fumbling with her necklace, looks across the room -- 
What she's looking at:     the side table with the remote that opens the vault. 
42   INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                      42

Richmond, reaching out for her, then as she passes him; he takes her by the hand -- 
-- and now they are dancing, their bodies pressed together. They move slowly. She hums. He tries to get fancy, spin her with one arm -- 
-- no good. They're too drunk for it, starts to lose balance, separate. 
They giggle. Smile at each other. Now Christy manages to unhook her necklace, and as she starts to drop it in           * the drawer of the nightstand --                                   *

-- which suddenly dies --

Christy, as she spins toward the table again, still with the necklace in her hand.

The table as Christy reaches out, grabs a remote, turns.

-- but now here comes another sigh of relief and we find out why. 
53    INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                       53 
Suddenly there's ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING -- she's turned the STEREO ON. Christy starts humming, replaces the clicker, drops the necklace in the drawer.                      * 
Then they are into each other's arms. Their bodies press. Their bodies sway. He moves a hand to her breasts -- 
-- Christy breaks loose, shakes a finger at him, as if to say, "naughty, naughty" -- 
-- then with one hand, she pulls a zipper down. The dress falls off her body. Her breasts spring free. She is wearing only her panties now and high heels. And a smile. 
She is stunning looking and she knows it and men have always gone nuts over her and she knows that too. And Richmond can't resist her either, goes to her, bends her back, caresses her neck, begins sucking her nipples. Christy moans. 
54    INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                54 
Luther, in the chair, embarrassed, averting his eyes. 
But the MOANING from the other room GROWS LOUDER, more insistent. 
55    INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                       55 
Christy, pulling away for a moment, starting to work at Richmond's tie, shakes him out of his suit jacket, reaches for his belt, loosens it. She is working at his shirt buttons now and their breathing is audible and in a moment he is down to his boxer shorts and then her panties are off, her shoes kicked away and they are near the vault mirror now. As they approach it, they stare at themselves. 
-- and she drops to her knees beside him -- 
-- and Richmond can only lie there, watching her -- 
-- and she gets a better grip on the letter opener -- 
-- and Richmond still only lies there, watching her --

-- and she raises the letter opener slowly very high above her head, the point aimed at his heart -- 
-- and Richmond screams one time -- 
-- and as Christy starts to kill him, two well-dressed men in business suits burst through the bedroom doorway, GUNS in their hands, and they BLOW HER BRAINS OUT before the opener reaches Richmond's heart... 
65   INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                   65 
Luther, in SLOW MOTION and this is what he does -- 
-- he reels back in the chair, eyes wide, jaw slack, mouth open -- 
-- this is a man who has seen everything but nothing has prepared him for this -- 
-- his arms flop over the arms of the chair, his body loses strength, he tries to look away, can't -- 
-- and this is what he sees -- 
66   INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                          66 
Christy, fighting for another instant of life -- 
-- no chance -- 
-- the two bullets have shattered her brain, her eyes roll up into her head, the letter opener drops to the rug, she collapses like a rag doll -- 
-- and blood is everywhere. 
67   INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                   67

68   INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                          68 
The two well-dressed men in business suits. 
BILL BURTON is the more formidable. Mid-40s, he looks like a retired tight end. No body fat. Intimidating. But right now he is shaking and he can't stop it. He puts his gun away, goes to Richmond.

TIM COLLIN is closing in on 30. Handsome. In wonderful shape. Burton is more physical, Collin more lethal. He puts his gun away, goes to Christy. 
Richmond is trying to sit. He is as drunk as before but now he is also close to shock. He reaches over, manages to pick up the bloody letter opener. 
RICHMOND Kill her? 
Collin, by the body, nods. 
BURTON No choice in the matter. 
His words are efficient but clearly, he has been rocked. 
Richmond, staring stupidly at the letter opener. He drops it back to the floor, tries to stand, can't. Burton helps him back to the bed. Which is when he passes out cold. 
Burton and Collin look at each other now. 
BURTON Jesus, Tim, what did we do? 
COLLIN (echoing Burton) No choice in the matter. 
69   INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                  69

GLORIA RUSSELL moving through the bedroom door. Russell's 40, well-dressed, attractive and very smart. Now she sees what's happened, stops dead. 
Now she moves forward, looks at Burton and Collin.    It's very clear from the outset: these three are not friendly.

The watch face is illuminated in the darkness. The second hand is fifteen seconds away from the top. 
Luther takes a deep breath, waits in silence.

Burton and Russell moving with Richmond toward one of the cars. Burton takes the man in his arms, leaving Russell free to open the back door. 
Collin dumps the plastic bag into the trunk, shuts it, moves quickly so that he can get a decent view of the road. 
The road in front of the house. Empty. Collin hurries to the Towncar where Burton is struggling to get Richmond comfortably stretched out on the back seat.

He rises, opener in hand, and goes to the far window that has a view of the front of the house. He looks out, grimaces.

Luther in the night, thirty feet up, and he can hear COMMOTION inside the house and he tries to go faster --

COLLIN -- relax, I got his license number, remember? -- 
RUSSELL (whirling on him) -- you think he's going to just sit around waiting for us? -- Asshole -- 
COLLIN -- take it easy, Miss Russell --

BURTON (trying for calm) -- everybody shut up, all right? 
He is staring at his reflection in the big mirror.      He crosses to it, goes to his knees, studies the rug. 
The rug -- indentations in the expensive carpet. 
BURTON Oh boy... 
Burton and Collin with a crowbar, working at the mirror. 
The MIRROR; there is a TEAR and a POP and it swings open. 
130   INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                     130 
All three going inside, looking around.    The chair, the looted shelves. The truth thuds home. 
Russell turns, looks out at the bedroom through the door. 
Kate speaks quickly now, her voice low. 
KATE Luther, you don't have me. 
The last words in this world he wanted to hear, but you can't tell from his face. 
LUTHER Kate -- 
KATE -- you know what it's like being the only kid in show and tell who got to talk about visiting day?

LUTHER This move -- I'm talking permanent, you understand. 
KATE We don't see each other anyway -- we haven't seen each other since Mom died and that's a year. (a step toward him) Look, you chose your life. You had that right. You were never around for me. Fine. But I have no plans to be around for you. 
And now she stops, turns away toward the path -- 
-- Luther can say nothing, watches her -- 
-- then she spins back -- 
KATE (louder now) -- wait a minute -- you're lying about something, aren't you? -- 
LUTHER -- no -- 
KATE -- are you active again? -- is that why you're here now? 
LUTHER -- no -- 
Kate moves in close now -- 
KATE -- I don't believe you -- (big) -- Christ, Father, what have you done? 
And on those words -- 
136   INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - DAY                             136 
Christy Sullivan's body. 
We're back in the master bedroom but now there is a lot of police activity -- people work around the corpse. The place is covered with black fingerprint powder.

SETH FRANK moves into the room -- Bogart at 40. Chief Homicide Detective of Middleton County, Virginia but he had a decade of top work in New York City. Bright, funny, and tough enough for anything you want to throw at him. 
He kneels beside the body next to an older man. This is the MEDICAL EXAMINER, fat and bored. Seth studies Christy; sadly shakes his head. 
SETH Christy Sullivan? 
MEDICAL EXAMINER (nods) Wife of Walter -- most likely came home and stumbled onto a burglary -- 
WOMAN (O.S.) -- some burglary. 
LAURA SIMON. Laura is early 30s, and the best lab technician Seth has ever known, and he knew some good ones in New York. 
LAURA SIMON I wish my carpets were this clean. And I can't find a single decent                        * fingerprint. 
SETH You serious, Laura? 
LAURA SIMON (bewildered) It's like Mary Poppins was here. 
SETH Could someone have let him in? 
LAURA SIMON Sorry, Seth, but the entire Sullivan household went to Barbados two days ago. 
SETH Thank you for your support.

LAURA SIMON Wait -- it gets worse -- (moving to the door) -- the shots came from here. If she interrupted a burglary, she should have been here -- (moving to the bed now) -- she was killed where she is -- all the blood patterns indicate that. But she was looking toward the bed -- what in hell was she looking at? 
137   INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - DAY                                      137 
Seth says nothing as he and Laura go in the vault.      Seth stares at the chair. 
LAURA SIMON Looks like someone sat here -- but I couldn't find any prints. (lowering her voice -- indicating the one-way mirror) You think Sullivan holed up in the chair and watched his wife perform? 
SETH I hope not -- (shakes his head) -- he's such a great man. 
He moves back into the bedroom. 
138   INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - DAY                             138 
Another cop is working on the wall by the bed table where a hole the size and shape of a bullet is visible. 
SETH (as he moves past) Careful digging that out. 
The cop nods. 
MEDICAL EXAMINER Looks like he tried to strangle her.

Humiliated. 
WALTER SULLIVAN I'd hoped I could satisfy her... but you know... she had needs and she didn't want to go behind my back... she suggested the chair... she hoped I might get to like sitting there... (beat) ... I didn't... (takes a breath) I've tried for eighty years to live a decent life. I've given a billion dollars to charity. If this comes to trial, none of that will be remembered -- I'll just go out as the joke of the world. 
Seth.   He closes his notebook. 
SETH I understand, sir; I'll do what I can. 
WALTER SULLIVAN (beat) Will you listen to me whine? Please forgive me, Mr. Frank. Just do your job. (beat) And I'll do mine. 
Walter slowly moves to the door.    Seth watches him. Sadly... 
147   EXT. WHITE HOUSE - MAGIC HOUR                                 147 
A gorgeous SHOT of a very famous place.    The sun is setting. It all looks magical. 
148   INT. WHITE HOUSE - NORTH PORTICO - NIGHT                     148 
A room filled with well-dressed men and women. Formal attire. The  rich and the famous. But the only one we recognize is Sandy Lord, deep in conversation with several other men. Now, someone says his name. 
MAN (O.S.) Sandy. (as Sandy turns) Is there anything I can do? 
SANDY LORD Mr. President. 
And on those words -- The 44th President of the United States. He has all the natural charm in the world. He is remarkably bright, with a phenomenal memory. He is, also, at this moment, one of the most popular men in American history, three years into a brilliant first term, a shoo-in for re-election when that ritual comes. 
His name, by the way, is Alan Richmond, and we've seen him before, most recently lying drunk in the back seat of a dark Towncar. 
RICHMOND Take a walk with me. 
He and Sandy start out of the room. A well-dressed woman moves with them. She is Chief of Staff and her name is GLORIA RUSSELL. 
Two men in suits follow behind. Burton and Collin are their names and they are the best the Secret Service has to offer. 
149   INT. WHITE HOUSE - CORRIDOR - NIGHT                          149 
The group, as they leave the room, come to a wide corridor. 
RICHMOND Tell me about Walter -- how is he? 
SANDY LORD Eighty and alone, Mr. President. 
RICHMOND He understands officially my hands are tied? 
SANDY LORD Mr. President, he's touched at your concern.

RICHMOND Any news of the killer? (as Sandy indicates "no") Well, why isn't there? Who's in charge of the case? 
SANDY LORD Top man -- eight years homicide work in New York. But I understand how you feel -- it's hard to be patient. 
RICHMOND (terribly upset) No one understands how I feel -- I'm supposed to have all this power but I can't help my oldest friend -- you know and I know that more than any man alive Walter Sullivan put me here -- and now when he most needs me, he must feel abandoned. 
CLOSEUP - RICHMOND                                              * 
On fire -- 
RICHMOND -- I'll hold a press conference -- and I'll have Walter come -- and I will embrace him before the world. 
Sandy.   Listening.    Moved. 
SANDY LORD He'll treasure that, Mr. President. What a generous gesture. Thank you. Thank you. 
And he reaches out, shakes Richmond's hand, squeezes Richmond's arm and -- Richmond -- suddenly screaming in pain -- Sandy pulls back, shocked. Richmond looks embarrassed. 
RICHMOND (quick smile) Damn tennis elbow is killing me. 
And on that -- 
150   INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT                     150 
Richmond, immediately after, and he sure isn't smiling now -- he storms toward the Oval Office, Russell, Burton and Collin hurrying to keep up.

Burton opens the door for them, closes it once they're inside. 
RICHMOND (throws off his jacket, turns on Russell) This thing's worse, Gloria. I need to see a doctor. 
RUSSELL The country would have to be informed, Mr. President. 
RICHMOND What happened to my right to privacy? (rolls up his sleeve, studies his cut) I think she nicked a tendon. 
RUSSELL Burton says it's a flesh wound -- 
RICHMOND (to Burton) -- when did you become such an expert, Bill? -- Ever been wounded? -- 
BURTON (quietly) Yes, sir. Many times. 
The fireplace.   Richmond goes to it, rubs his arm, stares at the flames. 
RUSSELL Are you serious about that press conference, Alan? 
RICHMOND Of course I am -- Walter's been like a father to me. 
RUSSELL Shall I bring Mrs. Richmond home for it? 
VALERIE (as they study the pictures) You always did disappear good, Luther. 
LUTHER You mean I've got a weak face. Thanks, Val. 
VALERIE You're lucky is all -- some of my customers, they stand out no matter what. 
An order form book.    Valerie licks a pencil with her tongue. 
VALERIE How many passports you need? 
LUTHER (thinks) Four should cover it. 
VALERIE (writes this down) Now you'll want different looks, and matching international driver's licenses -- I'll throw in some dummy credit cards, seeing it's you. How the rugs I made you holding up? 
LUTHER They're good. Beards and mustaches, too. 
VALERIE (pleased) I try to give value for money. Leaving the country permanent? 
LUTHER It may come to that.

LUTHER Europe's fine. Maybe the Caribbean for winters. When can I pick up? 
VALERIE Usually takes some time, but for you, I'll rush it. 
LUTHER Thanks, Val. I've always been able to count on you. 
Valerie puts the order book down, studies him. 
LUTHER What? 
VALERIE I don't want to know what you're into, but leaving forever... 
LUTHER Finish it. 
VALERIE I never figured you for a runner -- thirty percent of my runners kill themselves within five years.

Seth mimes opening the "bedroom door," stepping inside, closing it. He makes a click with his tongue. 
SETH I am Christy Sullivan and I walk in and surprise a burglar. 
Seth moves to the "vault door," mimes closing that, makes a grunt. 
LAURA Now you're the burglar coming out of the vault and being surprised. 
SETH Gold star. (aims his finger like a pistol) I draw my gun -- 
LAURA (cutting in) -- then why do you bother to strangle her when you could just shoot? 
SETH That's nothing -- why do I bother to have her strip and then put her clothes back on? 
LAURA There I can help you -- see, before you were a burglar you were a dry cleaner and you still love beautiful clothes.

SETH She had a point-21 blood alcohol level. -- she was too drunk to drive. I've checked every cab and limo company in the area and not one of them knows anything. Someone drove her home. Goddamit, who? And why haven't they come forward? 
LAURA Maybe whoever drove her home killed her.

An open door behind them. A TELEPHONE REPAIRMAN appears. Nice looking kid with a dazzling smile.

SETH Good service, thanks. 
TELEPHONE REPAIRMAN (dazzling smile as he goes) Part of the job. 
Seth and Laura.     Seth's lost his train of thought.   Then -- 
SETH Oh yeah    -- remember that bullet hole in    the wall? Had the lab dig out the    slug -- guess what -- no slug --    why does the burglar take the time    to do that?

SETH Luther Whitney -- (beat) -- one of the great thieves of the world. 
Seth.    The words pour out.

(faster) Called a buddy at the Bureau -- they keep track of this stuff internationally -- he says maybe only a half a dozen guys alive could have pulled off the Sullivan job -- I'm tracing all six -- (beat) -- but Whitney's the only one lives in Washington. 
Laura.   Looking at Seth now.   Starting to get excited, too. 
LAURA Why haven't I ever heard of him? 
SETH Because he hasn't been arrested in thirty years. 
LAURA (indicating mug shot) This his graduation picture from Harvard?

SETH I think you can help me. 
KATE Lieutenant -- I don't know the man -- he was in jail when I was a kid, when he got out my mother and I went off to live by ourselves. We don't make contact. He doesn't care about me. I've seen him all of once this past year. 
SETH When? 
KATE Couple days ago. He said he might be going away. There. I just helped you. Can I go back to work now? 
SETH (shakes his head) Any idea where he might have gone? 
Seth and Kate realize something: In a different world, under different circumstances, they'd probably be starting an affair. 
KATE (snappishly) Quit wasting my time -- if he doesn't want you to find him, you're not going to find him. 
SETH You saying he's left town, skipped the country, what?

Collin squints into the morning sun.

Luther and a SALESMAN are engaged in conversation. Luther is buttoning a new raincoat to the throat. The Salesman holds several hats. Luther picks one, tries it on. 
LUTHER I need to look really good today. 
He doesn't like the hat. 
SALESMAN Business? (as Luther tries the other hat -- very rakish, he likes it) It's a woman, I can tell. (as Luther nods) Never too late, is it?

Russell in the doorway now, glaring at them. 
RUSSELL You're both assholes, now move -- 
And on that -- 
293    INT. OVAL OFFICE - DAY                                    293 
The note that was sent to Russell and the Polaroid of the letter opener. 
PULL BACK to reveal -- 
The Polaroid and the note are on Richmond's desk. He studies them. Russell, Burton and Collin stand silently watching him, their hatred of each other clear. 
The smell of death's in the room. 
RICHMOND (holding the note now, his voice is, when he speaks, calm; to Burton) Any idea who could have forged it?

BURTON I talked to Seth Frank -- apparently Whitney learned how in prison. 
RICHMOND Very gifted man. 
The window as he walks to it, looks out. 
RICHMOND And are we close to stopping him? 
RUSSELL We're working round the clock. 
RICHMOND Good to know that. 
BURTON He'll make a mistake. 
HOLD ON the empty room. 
Keep HOLDING. 
Now, silently, the vault door opens -- a gardener steps out, clicker in hand. 
The gardener -- it's Luther -- he clicks it, tosses it back inside -- 
-- the door starts to close -- 
-- but before it shuts, we can see he's returned what he took the night of the robbery. 
And as he moves silently toward the door.

Kate in her car as it teeters at the edge and then starts its long fall to the jogging path far below. 
Luther.   Handing something back. 
LUTHER And this? 
Sullivan takes it -- 
-- it's the letter opener. 
Sullivan leans back, shuts his eyes. 
WALTER SULLIVAN You could have stolen this. 
LUTHER I did steal it. But that isn't my blood and those aren't my prints. 
CLOSEUP ON SULLIVAN                                               * 
Eyes still shut -- 
-- and he's very old and you expect tears -- 
-- but he didn't get to be Walter Sullivan by crying -- 
-- HOLD ON Walter --

Luther has gotten out too. They stand close to each other. They nod. Then Walter starts away. 
WALTER SULLIVAN (turns -- quiet now, at peace) I did love her, you know. 
And he walks away. 
A White House SECURITY GUARD as Walter approaches. 
WALTER SULLIVAN Is he working late? I haven't an appointment but I'd like to see him if I might. 
GUARD You don't need an appointment, Mr. Sullivan. 
And as he waves him through -- 
Luther, standing there, watching the old man. 
Walter, a final turn back, a nod of the head. 
Luther.   He nods back, returns to the car, gets in --

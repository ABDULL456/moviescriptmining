DJANGO I gotta tell ya? You didn't tell me I gotta tell ya. As they continue to converse, they start heading downhill toward a western town. They pass by a sign that says; "WELCOME TO DAUGHTREY, 
TEXAS" 
/Z Dr.SCHULTZ Well I'm naturally curious, of course, but there's no reason you MUST tell me. In fact an air of mystery adds a dash of panache to any steed. And I do believe Tony wears it well. Good job Django, well done. 
EXT - THE WESTERN TOWN OF DAUGHTREY - MORNING As the citizens of Daughtrey wake up, Django and Dr.Schultz ride Fritz and Tony through the main street of town..Daughtrey looks like a million western towns we've seen before in movies. But to the TOWNSPEOPLE of Daughtrey, Django and the German don't look like a million other visitors. Dr.SCHULTZ What's everybody staring at? 
DJANGO They never seen a nigger on a horse before. Dr.SCHULTZ What's this bizarre obsession they have with. you not riding horses? 
DJANGO You askin' me? Dr.Schultz stops Fritz in front of a saloon, and dismounts. Django has a little trouble both stopping Tony and getting off him, but it gets done. Dr.Schultz keeps bombarding The Slave with questions. Dr.SCHULTZ So what other archaic rituals are you people verboten to take part in? As per usual with this white man, Django thinks; "What"? Dr.SCHULTZ I'm just trying to get a clear idea on what you can do, and what you can't do, and if you can't do it, why can't you do it? Like for instance, what if we were to walk in this saloon here, sit down at a table, order a drink, and drink it? Would the authorities frown on that? 
DJANGO Hell yeah, they gonna frown. Dr.SCHULTZ What part would they find the most offensive? 
DJANGO All of it. I can't be walkin' in no saloon. I can't be sittin' my ass on no chair, at no table. I can't be drinkin' no drink. And I definitely can't be sharin' no drink, with no white man, in public. Dr.SCHULTZ So if you and I did those things, that would be considered enough of a infraction to make the saloon keeper go get the sheriff? 
DJANGO You bet your sweet ass they get the sheriff. The good doctor extends his hand towards the saloon entrance. Dr.SCHULTZ Well in that case Django, after you. 
DJANGO Whoa - I ain't funnin, I can't go in there. Dr.SCHULTZ Django you're going to have to learn to trust me, and as the man said; "There's no time like the,present." He takes Django by the arm and leads him into the entryway of the establishment. 
INT - SALOON - MORNING The nervous black slave and the confident German'dentist walk into the saloon. The SALOON KEEPER (PETE) is high up on a chair placed high up on a table, to change a candle in the saloons chandelier. His back is turned away from the two patrons. Dr.SCHULTZ Good morning inn keeper, two beers for two weary travelers. 
SALOON KEEPER It',s still pretty early, we won't be open for about a hour. But by then we'll be servin' breakfast - He turns around and sees them. 
SALOON KEEPER Whoa! What the hell you think you doin' boy, get that nigger outta here. 
IT 
TIME CUT 
EXT - SALOON - MORNING It's about five minutes later, and the Saloon Keeper comes running out of the bar to get the Sheriff. When Dr.Schultz, sitting at a table with the young Django, calls; Dr.SCHULTZ Inn keeper! Remember, get the sheriff, not the marshall. This wouldn't be the marshalls jurisdiction.'This is just a infraction, on what I assume is a simple county ordinance, and that would fall under the domain of the Sheriff. The Saloon Keeper runs away. The two men sit by themselves in the empty saloon. Dr.SCHULTZ It looks like we must act as our own bartender. The German stands up, and walks-behind the bar, and pours two beer's from the tap into mugs. Django remains seated, and after a beat, asks; 
DJANGO What kinda dentist are you? This makes the doctor laugh, as he pours the beer's. Dr.SCHULTZ I haven't practiced dentistry in five years - Not to say once I know you better, I wouldn't like to get a look at that mouth - I'm sure it's a disaster - But these days I practice a new profession ... . Bounty Hunter. This gets no reaction from Django. Dr.SCHULTZ Do you know what a Bounty Hunter is? The Black Man shakes his head, no. As the good doctor, walks back to the table carrying the mugs of beer, 
HE EXPLAINS; Dr.SCHULTZ Well the way the slave trade deals in human lives for cash, a bounty hunter, deals in corpses. 
Dr.SCHULTZ (CONT'D) The state places a bounty on a man's head. I track that man, I find that man, I kill that man. After I've killed him, I transport that man's corpse back to the authorities - and sometimes that's easier said then done. I show that corpse to the authorities - proving, yes indeed, I have truly killed him - At which point, the authorities pay me the bounty. (lifting his beer) Cheers. The two men touch glasses, and take a drink. 
DJANGO What's a bounty? Dr.SCHULTZ It's like a reward. 
DJANGO You kill people and they give you a reward? Dr.SCHULTZ Certain people, yes. 
DJANGO White people? Dr.SCHULTZ Mostly. A few Mexicans. Couple Chinamen. 
DJANGO Bad people? Dr.SCHULTZ Badder they are, bigger the reward. Which brings me to you, and I must admit I'm at a bit of a quandary when it comes to you. On one hand, I despise slavery. On the other hand, I need your help, and if you're not in a position to refuse, all the better. So for the time being, I'm going to make this slave malarkey work to my benefit. 
(BEAT) Still... . having said that, .I feel guilty. So... I'd like the two of us to enter into an agreement. I'm looking for The Brittle Brothers, however in this endeavor I'm at a slight disadvantage, in so far as, I don't know what they look like. But you do... .dont'cha? 
1G 
ï¿½. DJANGO SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK Django, back at The Carrucan Plantation, held down by Roger and Ellis Brittle, as Big John BURNS the "r" into his cheek with a BRANDING IRON. 
BACK TO DJANGO 
DJANGO I know what they look like, all right. Dr.SCHULTZ Good. So, here's my agreement. You travel with me till we find them - 
DJANGO - Where we goin'? Dr.SCHULTZ I hear at least two of them are overseeing up in Gatlinburg, but I don't know where. That means we visit every plantation in Gatlinburg till we find them. And when we find them, you point them out, and I kill them. You do that, I agree to give you your freedom... . twenty-five dollars per Brittle brother - that's seventy-five dollars... . your horse, Tony even though I've already gave him to you -- but once the final Brittle brother lies dead in the dust, I'll buy you a new saddle, and a new suit of clothes, handsome cowboy hat included. Dr.Schultz's eyes go to the saloon window. Dr.SCHULTZ And as if on cue... . here comes the sheriff. 
EXT - SALOON - MORNING We see the sheriff, BILL SHARP, walk towards the saloon cradling a Winchester. Some TOWNSPEOPLE (like the Saloon Keeper) stand around to watch. A. YOUNG BOY leads a herd of BABY GOATS through town. Sheriff Sharp stands in the middle of the street. 
SHERIFF SHARP Okay boys, fun's over, come on out. Both the doctor and Django stand up and walk to the front porch. As they do, The Sheriff says; 
SHERIFF SHARP Now why y'all wanna come into my town, start trouble, and scare all these nice people? You ain't got nothin' better to do, then to come into Bill Sharps town and show your ass - From his top step on the porch, Dr. King Schultz extends his hand toward the sheriff, as if to shake it... :. 
.THEN... A SMALL DERRINGER - POPS into Schultz's hand from a metal sliding apparatus concealed under his jacket sleeve. Once in hand, the dentist FIRES one tiny bullet into the belly of Bill Sharp. The tiny gun makes a tiny POP sound. The shocked Bill Sharp lets out a ugly groan, and doubles over in the dirt. The TOWNSPEOPLE are startled. As is Django. As Schultz walks down the porch steps, to the fallen sheriff, reloading his tiny pop shooter, a PEDESTRIAN yells out; 
PEDESTRIAN What did you jus' do to our sheriff? Dr.Schultz answers him by putting another tiny bullet in the law man's skull, killing him dead. In the background, ONE WOMAN faints. The Boy and his Goats scatter. Dr.Schultz looks over at the Saloon Keeper, across the street. Dr.SCHULTZ Now you can go get the marshall. 
TIME CUT 
EXT - DAUGHTREY MAIN STREET - DAY U.S.MARSHALL GILL TATUM snaps the MENFOLK OF Daughtrey to attention. 
DJANGO They could do that? Dr.SCHULTZ I'm not saying they would, but they could. 
DJANGO They do that I'll kill 'em. Dr.SCHULTZ Great! Now you get hung for killin' a white man. The point being is the place,is just too dangerous for you. 
DJANGO Well I gotta go, when do I go? Dr.SCHULTZ When you get more dangerous. 
EXT - CHATTANOOGA - DAY Muddy and wet big city Chattanooga. We're in the back of a STORE that. sells SERVANT/HOUSE NIGGER UNIFORMS. Django comes bursting out of the stores back door. He's very distressed. One glance at the outfit he's wearing explains the distress. 
Z 
DJANGO is dressed in a powder blue satin Little Lord Fauntleroy outfit, that wouldn't be out of place in the court of Marie Antoinette at Versailles. Dr.Schultz comes trailing after him. Dr.SCHULTZ Django, you have to, it's part of "The Act". You're playing a character. Your character is The Valet. This is what The Valet wears. Remember what I told you. During the act, you can never break character. 
CUT TO 
EXT - BENNETT MANOR- DAY We see Dr. Schultz, riding slightly in front of Django, dressed in his blue satin Little Lord Fauntleroy outfit, as they enter the property of BENNETT MANOR, a plantation in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. Django leads a riderless horse, behind him and Tony. As the two men ride their horses up the road that leads to the front steps of Bennett Manor, alongside the cotton fields, all the SLAVES stop picking cotton, and straighten their bent backs up to stare in wonder at this sight. The patriarch of Bennett Manor, SPENCER "BIG DADDY" BENNETT, dressed in a fancy leisure suit of the day, emerges from the double doors of the mansion, and stands on the top steps, hands on hips, watching the white man and black man move from the background to the foreground. While there are plenty BLACK MALES out in the cotton fields, the majority of the slave population of Bennett Manor is pretty.BLACK FEMALES, fourteen to twenty-four, referred to as, "PONY'S". The biggest money making crop of this farm, after cotton. As Dr.Schultz and fancy pants Django, bring Fritz and Tony to a stop in front of Bennett Manor, they've drawn quite a crowd of SLAVES, BENNETT FAMILY MEMBERS, and WHITE WORKERS (OVERSEER'S). Spencer Bennett keeps on the top step so he won't be forced to look up at the darkee on the horse. 
SPENCER BENNETT It's against the law for niggers to ride horses in this territory. Dr.SCHULTZ This is my valet, and my valet doesn't walk. 
SPENCER BENNETT I said niggers - 
Z .ate` Dr.SCHULTZ His name is Django, he's a free man, and he can ride what he pleases. 
SPENCER BENNETT Not on my.property, around my niggers he can't. Dr.SCHULTZ My good sir, perhaps we got off on the wrong boot. Allow me to unring this bell. My name is Dr.King Schultz, this is my valet, Django, and these are our horses, Fritz, and Tony. Fritz, does his head bow. This makes the pretty PONY'S surrounding Bennett, giggle. Dr.SCHULTZ Mr. Bennett, I've been lead to believe you are a gentleman, and a business man. And it is in these capacities that we've ridden from Texas to Tennessee to talk with you now. 
SPENCER BENNETT State your business. Dr.SCHULTZ I wish to purchase one of your nigger gals. 
SPENCER BENNETT You and your Jimmie rode from Texas to Tennessee, to buy one of my nigger gals, no appointment, no nuttin'? Dr.SCHULTZ I'm afraid so. 
SPENCER BENNETT Well what if I say, I don't like you, or your fancy pants. nigger, and I wouldn't sell you a tinkers damn - what'cha gotta say about that? Dr.SCHULTZ Mr. Bennett, if you are the business man, I've been led to believe you to be, I have five thousand things I might say, that could change your mind. i This gets everybody's attention, not least of all Spencer Bennett. Spencer laughs. 
ZG 
SPENCER BENNETT C'mon inside, get yourself something' cool to drink. The incognito bounty hunter, dismounts his steed, as does Django. Then the good doctor walks up the steps to Bennett Manor. Dr.SCHULTZ Maybe while we discuss business, you could provide one of your loveliest black creatures to escort Django here around your magnificent grounds. 
SPENCER Absolutely. Betina! A pretty, fleshy, sweet jelled, twenty-two year old slave gal named BETINA, snaps to attention. 
BETINA Yes sir, Big Daddy? 
SPENCER 
(TO SCHULTZ) What's your Jimmies name again? Dr.SCHULTZ Django. 
SPENCER Betina sugar, take Django around the grounds. Show 'em all the pretty stuff. 
BETINA As you please, Big Daddy. Dr.Schultz lowers his voice, and says to the plantation owner; Dr.SCHULTZ Mr. Bennett, I must remind, you, Django is a free man. He cannot be treated like a slave. Within the bounds of good taste, he must be treated as an extension of myself. 
SPENCER Understood., Schultz. Betina? 
BETINA Yes, sir? 
SPENCER Django isn't a slave. Django is a free man. Do you understand? You're not to treat him like any of these other niggers around here, cause he ain't like any of these other niggers around here. Ya got it? 
BETINA Ya want I should treat 'em like white folks? 
SPENCER No that's not what I said. 
BETINA Then I don't know what'cha want Big Daddy. 
SPENCER Yes, I can see that. 
(HE THINKS) What's the name of that peckawood boy from town works with the glass? His mama works at the lumber yard? He comes by and fixes the winda's when we have a problem? The MAMMY OF BENNETT MANOR chimes in; 
MAMMY OF BENNETT MANOR Oh, you mean Jerry. 
SPENCER Yeah, that's the boy's name, Jerry. 
(TO BETINA) You know Jerry, dont'cha sugar? 
BETINA Yes 'em, Big Daddy. 
SPENCER Well that's it then... just treat 'em like you would Jerry. 
O.B. But Willards riding off. 
SPENCER Fuck Willard! Look, let's not forget why we're here. We gotta killer nigger over that hill. And we gotta make a lesson outta 'em. 
RANDY Okay, I'm confused, are the bags on or off? Robert takes off his bag, and says; 
ROBERT I think we all think the bags was a nice idea. But, not pointing any fingers, they could of been done better. So how 'bout, no bags this time, but next time, we do the bags right, and then we go full regalia. Everyone takes off their bag. 
SPENCER Wait a minute, I didn't say no bags! 
YO 
TERRY But nobody can see. 
SPENCER So? 
TERRY So, it would be nice to see. 
SPENCER Goddamit, this is a raid! I can't see, you can't see, so what? All that matters is can the fuckin horse see! That's a raid. Spencer puts on his sack, everyone else, reluctantly, does as well. 
EXT - LAKE - NIGHT The THIRTY RIDERS, all with SACKS OVER THEIR HEADS, come riding over the hill, hooting and hollerin. Since nobody can see they ride haphazard into each other.'Redfish falls off his horse hard on his fat ass. They surround the camp, and when the sleeping Schultz and Django don't react, they know something's up. But since nobody can see, everybody and everybody's horse is. confused. 
WE HEAR A GROUP OF LINES FROM CIRCLING COWBOYS ON HORSEBACK WITH BAGS OVER THEIR HEADS: "Where are they, I can't see" - "They tricked us" - "Did somebody fall" "Where the hell are they" "Y'all, Redfish fell off his horse-He's kinda hurt bad." Then amongst the confusion... 
WE SNAP ZOOM TO 
A BIG TREE on the other side of the lake Then quickly cut into The Tree. Till we're in a CU OF Dr.SCHULTZ with a SCOPE SIGHT RIFLE up to his eye. 
SCOPE SIGHT POV The Yellow covered STICKS OF DYNAMITE protruding from the ground, are inside the scope sight circle, Horse hooves step around it. 
TWO SHOT Dr.SCHtJLTZ and DJANGO up in a tree. Dr.SCHULTZ Auf wiedersehen. 
L, He fires. The Camp EXPLODES Blowing Horses and Riders Apart. Dr.Schultz and Django lift up repeating rifles. Dr.SCHULTZ Let 'em have it! 
DJANGO I can't see nothin'. Dr.SCHULTZ Just fire into the smoke. The two treetop killers let loose with rifle fire. 
INSIDE OF THE SMOKE pandemonium reigns. Horses and Men trip over bodies and pieces of bodies, of horses and men. Men with legs and arms blown off, yell bloody murder, hurt and scared Horses cry. Some struggle to get the sacks off their heads, while scared horses dance and buck in panic. Some are shot by the rifle fire. The rest of the men not blown up, and still on horseback, between the sacks and the smoke, still can't see worth a damn. And Men and Horses collide with one another, which causes more bucking and riders falling. About fifteen of the men who can still ride, high tail it the fuck out of there. Whipped and whimpering like dogs. 
SPENCER BENNETT on his horse with the other fleeing regulators RIDES for his life... 
SCOPE SIGHT POV We see the back of the fleeing Bennett smack dab in the cross hairs. 
DJANGO scope sight rifle up to his eye. Schultz next to him, says; Dr.SCHULTZ He's getting away. 
DJANGO I got 'em. 
SPENCER'S HORSE his hooves race and rip up the grass. 
SPENCER riding for his life... 
DJANGO scope sight rifle up to his eye. 
Dr.SCHULTZ He's getting out of range. 
DJANGO I got 'em. INSERT: A black finger squeezes the rifle trigger. 
SPENCER BENNETT we're behind him as he rides away, OFF SCREEN we hear the whistling of what sounds like an incoming missle. 
SPENCER BENNETT we're in.front of Spencer Bennett as he rides, when Django's bullet, RIPS THROUGH his CHEST. 
DJANGO 
DJANGO I got 'em. 
SPENCER BENNETT falls from his horse, dead. 
DJANGO scope sight rifle in his hand, big smile on his face, looks.to Dr.Schultz. Dr.SCHULTZ Like that, huh? Referring to the scope sight rifle; 
DJANGO I like. Dr.SCHULTZ Well, I think while they take this opportunity to lick their wounds, we should take this opportunity to get the fuck out of Tennessee. They hop out of the tree. 
MONTAGE Dr.Schultz in a big city, buying Django a new saddle. Django gets his first initial "D" etched into it. The men go to different stores to purchase Django's wardrobe. The outfit bought, is selected by Django, with suggestions offered by Schultz. When he's done, Django looks damn handsome in his new duds. Brown cowboy boots, Green Corduroy Jacket, Smokey Grey Shirt, Tan Skin Tight Pants, and Light Brown Cowboy Hat. He looks a. bit like Elvis in "Flaming Star" and a Little Joe Cartwright on "Bonanza". However, tellingly, he keeps Ace Speck's Winter Coat as his winter coat. 
Django still hesitates. Dr.SCHULTZ Put down the rifle. Don't worry, I'm not mad at you. Take out Smitty Bacall's handbill. Django removes the folded up handbill from the pocket of his tan pants. Dr.SCHULTZ Read it aloud. Consider it today's lesson. 
DJANGO 
(READING) "Wanted, dead or alive. Smitty Bacall and The Smitty Bacall Gang. For murder and stagecoach robbery. Seven thousand dollars for Smitty Bacall. One thousand and five hundred dollars for each of his gang members. Known members of The Smitty Bacall Gang are as follows, DANDY MICHAELS, GERALD NASH, and 
CRAZY CRAIG KOONS." Dr.SCHULTZ Well done. Bravo. THAT is who Smitty Bacall is. If Smitty Bacall wanted to start a farm at twenty-two, they would never of printed that. 
(REFERRING TO 
THE HANDBILL) But Smitty Bacall wanted to rob stagecoaches, and he didn't mind killing people to do it. You want to save your wife by doing what I do? This is what I do. I kill people, and sell their corpses for cash. His corpse is worth seven thousand dollars. Now quit your pussyfootin and shoot him. Django SHOOTS. The Little Man down below behind the plow falls down. The Young Boy doesn't know what happened at first. Then he figures'out his father was just shot. He goes to him in the dirt. Dr.SCHULTZ You need to keep that Smitty Bacall handbill. 
DJANGO Why? Dr.SCHULTZ It's good luck. You always keep the handbill of your first bounty. They begin walking down the hill, to collect Smitty Bacall's body, leading the extra body horse behind them. 
As they walk down hill, they watch the little scene of Smitty Bacall's Son cradling his dying father.in his arms, the older man speaking his last words to his son before he dies. Dr.SCHULTZ See, they're having a tender little father son moment now. No doubt the most heartfelt one they've ever had. 
EXT - SNOWY FOREST - NIGHT It's now full on snowy winter in the hills. Django practices his quick draw against a SNOWMAN he's built. He sticks a BOTTLE in it, so the bottom of the bottle is where the snowman's heart would be. He DRAWS... Shoots the bottle heart! He DRAWS ... Shoots the left coal eye. He DRAWS ... Shoots the right coal eye. He DRAWS... Shoots the carrot nose. Dr.Schultz comes up behind him. Dr.SCHULTZ I think it's safe to say you're faster then the snowman. 
EXT - SNOWY FOREST - DIFFERENT NIGHT A outlaw gang known as The WILSON - LOWE GANG (five guys) ride through a snowy forest at night. When all five men and their Horses, are SHOT 
FROM ABOVE. 
DJANGO AND SCHULTZ up in a tree, FIRING DOWN ON them. 
EXT - WINTER MOUNTAIN TOWN MAIN STREET - NIGHT The FLAKES continue to FALL HARD as Dr.Schultz and Django ride down the main street of town, pulling poor Poncho who's FULLY LOADED DOWN with five corpses. 
The local SHERIFF, DON GUS, watches the two men ride up, he knows them. 
SHERIFF GUS Doctor and Django, how the hell are ya, and who the hell ya got there? Dr.SCHULTZ The Wilson - Lowe Gang. 
SHERIFF GUS Who the hell's The Wilson - Lowe Gang? Dr.Schultz removes a handbill from his inside jacket pocket, and hands it down to the friendly peace officer. Dr.SCHULTZ Bad Chuck Wilson, and meaner Bobby Lowe. And three of their acolytes. 
SHERIFF GUS Just leave 'em out here, they ain't going nowhere. And if'in they do, god must love 'em, so who are we to say. Come outta the snowy snow and git yourself some coffee. 
TNT - SHERIFF GUS'S OFFICE - NIGHT The snow encrusted bounty hunters come inside the lawmans office. They exchange pleasantries about the weather as the Sheriff pours them coffee. After the two frosty gentlemen have drunk some of the hot liquid, they get down to business. As Schultz and Gus discuss the bounties, Django reads the handbills aloud from off the wall. On the third one he reads, WARREN VANDERS, and a two thousand dollar bounty, "That one", Schultz says. Django RIPS IT off the wall. As the winter has progressed, we see they've become a genuine bounty hunting team. And Django, a genuine bounty hunter. 
EXT - PRETTY MEADOW - DAY The snow has melted, and it's SPRING. And inside of this meadow Django practices his fast draw against five men... .by Schultz throwing FIVE COINS in the air ... DJANGO DRAWS FAST shoots three coins, FIRES again hitting another, then falls to the ground to get the fifth. He looks up from the ground at Schultz. 
5L As Schultz collects the coins off the ground, he says; Dr.SCHULTZ You're pretty confident aren't you? Django nods his head, yes. Dr.SCHULTZ You have reason to be. He holds out his fist, opens his hand, the coins lay in his palm. All the coins have bullet holes dead in their center. He drops them on top of Django. 
DJANGO Still think I'm too green for Greenville? Dr.Schultz removes a pipe, sticks it in his mouth and says; Dr.SCHULTZ Oh you're ready for Greenville. He lights a match, then lights the pipe, puffing as he says; Dr.SCHULTZ Greenville ready for you, that I'm not so sure. He blows out the match... 
WE GO TO BLACK What we also saw in the above montage is Django shake off a lifetime of slavery. Django, in his green jacket, in his cowboy hat, on top of his steed Tony, with his gun hanging from his hip, has become his own man. He's not a slave anymore. He's a bounty hunter. 
BLACK TITLE CARD ACROSS THE SCREEN ONE LETTER AT A TIME STYLE (ala "Rocky" and 
"FLASHDANCE") 
MISSISSIPPI 
CUT TO 
EXT - THE TOWN OF GREENVILLE MISSISSIPPI - DAY The whole Main Street of Greenville is thick with five inches of shit brown mud that all the horse hooves, and wagon wheels, and slave feet have to wade through to get from one end of the town to the other. 
We see Django and Dr.Schultz enter the town, and slosh their horses in the mud,, down the main street of Greenville Mississippi. The buying and selling of slaves is what the whole town is built around. BLACK MEN, WOMEN, and CHILDREN in BONDAGE are everywhere you look. LINES OF CHAINED SLAVES being marched one way or the other, move through the muddy streets of Greenville. WHITE MEN on horses move them along. BUCKBOARDS filled with DOMESTIC SLAVES (HOUSE NIGGERS), and pretty PONYS, driven by WHITE MEN roll through the street. A YOUNG WHITE BOY (14 years old), a shepherd, leads a bunch of SLAVE CHILDREN through town. A SHEPHERD'S DOG, HELPS HIM OUT BY MOVING 
THE KIDS ALONG. Impromptu slave auctions take place on almost every block. A SUBTITLE APPEARS on the bottom of the screen: 
GREENVILLE 
CHICKASAW COUNTY, MISSISSIPPI Dr.Schultz takes in this African flesh market, where human beings sell other human beings, with disgust and a little bit of shock. Django is neither disgusted or. shocked, he knows first hand how Greenville operates. As he rides Tony through town in his snappy duds, he looks'at the BLACK MEN half dressed: in chains. He REMEMBERS HIMSELF with his six Other Companions from earlier, being walked through the mud of Main Street by The Speck Brothers. On that day he might as well of been a steer. Today, with a gun on his hip, money in his pocket, in his snappy outfit, astride his steed Tony, he feels so different from these wretched half naked bastards it gives him a bit of a chill. Django sees the towns railroad depot, and across from it a huge SLAVE PEN, like a STEER CORRAL. At the moment there's no train in the depot. 
WE FLASH ON The TRAIN, at a earlier time, pulling into the depot. 
INSIDE ONE OF THE BOXCARS amidst a boxcar full of shirtless BLACK MALES, Django watches the train pull into the station, from inside the wooden slates of the boxcar.: A hatch in the roof of the boxcar is NOISILY YANKED OPEN, and TWO WHITE SLAVE TRADERS (RUSS AND JUDD), peer down at their human cargo. 
JUDD Good god almighty these niggers stink! 
I F 
RUSS Niggers stink, where's the shock? (to the Slaves 
INT - KITCHEN - DAY Mrs.Harmony brings Broomhilda in her kitchen. The TWO DOMESTIC SLAVES that were in, there are chased out by the boss lady. Mrs.Harmony grabs Broomhilda by the wrist, and tells her; Mrs.HARMONY I want to have a word with you, wench. You met my boy Scotty. You can tell ain't no white girl gonna fool with him. And if they do fool with him, they fool with him for the wrong reason. Boy's twenty four, he still ain't a man yet. That's why you're here. Be nice to him. He's a very sweet boy. Play him right, he'll eat bird seed out of your palm. Play 'em wrong, you'll deal with me. 
BROOMHILDA I like Scotty. He's just shy is all. All he needs is a little confidence. Mrs.HARMONY And you'll give that to him? 
BROOMHILDA I'll do my best, mam. Scotty's a real sweet boy. Mrs.HARMONY He is, isn't he? 
BROOMHILDA Ah-huh. The mother lets go of the young lady's wrist. 
NARRATOR (VO) Basically The Harmony's bought a slave bride for young master Scotty that day. And the two kids had a nice time playing house for awhile. We see Scotty and Broomhilda catching butterflies in butterfly nets in the daytime.. At night they catch LIGHTNING BUGS together. At night in Scotty's bed, while the young man lay fast asleep, Broomhilda looks at her jelly jar of GLOWING LIGHTNING BUGS. 
NARRATOR (VO) As Scotty's sort of defacto sweetheart, if no visitors were about, Broomhilda would even join the family at their dinner table. We see them at dinner eating fried chicken and mashed potatoes and gravy. 
NARRATOR.(VO) And pretty soon she was adopted into a member of the family. Mrs.Harmony and Broomhilda sewing together. The Harmony family and Broomhilda playing croquet in the front yard. After dinner, Mrs.Harmony entertaining the family by playing the piano. Mr.Harmony reading the women and his son a story from a storybook. 
NARRATOR (VO) Scotty was never happier. Scotty and Broomhilda walking holding hands at Southern magic hour. Broomhilda having sex with Scotty, baby talking with him, talking him through it, making him feel loved and secure. 
NARRATOR (VO) After three months of this bliss, Scotty decided to take Broomhilda for a romantic weekend in Greenville. 
SCOTTY AND BROOMHILDA drive through the Main Street of Greenville, dressed to the nines, in a fancy carriage. Broomhilda dressed in a beautiful white lace dress, complete with white lace gloves, fancy ladies hat, and white parasol. Scotty, very proud of his pretty Pony, is dressed in a fashion best described as plantation pimp daddy. 
6O 
NARRATOR (VO) White masters would take their pretty Ponys to Greenville for a treat or romantic excursion, for two reasons-One, seeing how bad the other slaves had it, always made the papered Ponys appreciate their privilege position, (just in case they'd forgot). 
BROOMHILDA holding her parasol, looking like a black Daisy Miller, watches the OTHER SLAVES march by in the mud. They watch her too. 
INT - HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT Broomhilda and Scotty, and their luggage, move into the fancy hotel lobby, and rent a room at the front desk. 
INSERT: HOTEL REGISTRY Scotty signs his name. The DESK CLERKS HAND checks the box on the registry book that indicates darkee female companion. 
INT -. GREENVILLE - NIGHT Greenville at night is a little different. At night, RICH WHITE MASTERS showing off their Ponys (like Scotty), rule the streets. 
NARRATOR (VO) And two, there was a sliver of society that ran through Greenville at night that catered to white masters who were infected with a condition that was normally referred to as, "Nigger love." At night the streets, the bars, bistros, and buggy rides were ruled by rich white masters showing off their pretty Pony's. 
EXT - CLEOPATRA CLUB - NIGHT An establishing shot.of the three story house that has been converted into private club called, The Cleopatra Club. 
NARRATOR (VO) But the crown jewel of all this interracial frivolity, was the members only, Cleopatra Club. 
INSERT: GOLD PLAQUE with the name, THE CLEOPATRA CLUB on it, next to it is a profile of Nefertiti. 
INT - THE CLEOPATRA CLUB - RESTAURANT - NIGHT The interracial joint is jumping (as long as by interracial you mean white men and black women). Scotty and Broomhilda are enjoying a fancy dinner in the clubs dining room. We see across the dining room, the powerful white man, CALVIN CANDIE, sitting with some White Men and some Black Ponys, eyeing Broomhilda. 
SCOTTY I gotta tell you Broomhilda - I don't care if I go to. hell for this - I love you. And if loving you means I go to hell ... . Well then hello Mr.Devil. That was actually kind of funny. Broomhilda was right, all he needed was a little confidence. She puts her hand on his. 
NARRATOR (VO) Then... speak of the devil and the devil appears. 
CALVIN CANDIE appears at their table. 
CALVIN CANDIE Hello, my name is Calvin Candie, I own The Cleopatra Club. And I would just like to welcome an attractive couple'like yourselves to my favorite place on earth. Scotty stands up and shakes hands with Calvin. 
SCOTTY Thank you so much, it's a great honor. We love it here. Pointing at a empty chair. 
CALVIN CANDIE May I join you?- 
SCOTTY Please, by all means. Calvin sits down. Broomhilda gets a sinister chill from this smiling jack. Scotty, as per usual, is clueless. 
CALVIN CANDIE How long have you been a member? 
SCOTTY We just joined this weekend. 
CALVIN CANDIE Well our little private oasis appreciates your patronage. Some may consider the dues excessive, but they're necessary for us to create this haven for the alternative lifestyle we've all become accustomed to. 
SCOTTY Well said, and money well spent. He squeezes Broomhilda's hand. Candie sees this. 
CALVIN CANDIE It would be.my pleasure, your first weekend at the club, to join me and my friends at my table. Broomhilda knows this is a man to be avoided. But Scotty is swept away being courted by somebody like Calvin Candie. She tries to imply they should stay where they are. He brushes her off with a, "Don't be silly." We see Calvin introduce his table of friends to the couple, and they join the party. Calvin Candie has his arm around a foxy Pony named SHEBA, whose dress is a little more revealing then the others. They drink and talk, and the White Men have a forced good time. But Calvin Candie can't hide his sinister side from Broomhilda, and it keeps her uncomfortable, until she excuses herself from the table to go to bed. Scotty's having such a good time with his fancy friends he opts to stay behind.'Broomhilda leaves in a bit of a huff, due to Scotty's disobedience. If these fancy.fucking white men weren't around making Scotty feel so puffy chested, he'd never dismiss her that way. We FOLLOW Broomhilda out of the club, across the street, to the hotel. 
NARRATOR (VO) After excusing herself, she walked across the street to her hotel room. She got her white dress dirty in the mud, but she didn't care, the night was ruined anyway. Some romantic weekend. Wait till she gets home and tells his mother how he ignored her. She'll fix his fat ass. Wait till he asks her to scratch his back next time. She's gonna scrape every pimple. 
ï¿½-. BACK AT THE CLEO CLUB The now drunk Scotty is playing poker with Calvin and his friends. 
NARRATOR (VO) Back at The Cleopatra Club, as the night wore on, Calvin Candie suggested'a friendly card game. As the game wore on, it came down to a two thousand dollar pot between Calvin Candie and Scotty Harmony. Luckily for him, Scotty was holding.a inside straight. Calvin holds his cards with Sheba draped around him. She whispers something in his ear. 
SCOTTY I ain't dueling with you! I don't want to duel! 
CALVIN CANDIE Then get out of here, get in your buggy and get out of town. 
SCOTTY Sure. Let me just get my girl. 
CALVIN CANDIE You lost that girl, fat boy. 
SECOND NOTE... 
SCOTTY Wait!... . Look ... . Mr.Candie, I'm sorry I called you a cheat. But... please...I can't give you Broomhilda. 
CALVIN CANDIE Last chance fat boy, go home and get'useta to fuckin' another one. 
(BEAT) Or pick up that gun. Scotty can't leave. He can't go home without her. He can't face his parents. He can't walk out on her. No matters what happens he can't leave. 
THIRD NOTE... Calvin Candie SHOOTS Scotty Harmony dead. 
INT - HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT Calvin Candie and his entourage enter the hotel lobby and go up to the 
FRONT DESK CLERK.. 
CALVIN CANDLE Hello Oliver. 
FRONT DESK CLERK (OLIVER) Hello Mr.Candie, good evening. 
CALVIN CANDLE Good evening to you as well,. young Oliver. Could you please inform me which room your guest Scott Harmony is staying in? 
INT - HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT Broomhilda is asleep in bed... 
WHEN ... .Calvin comes'BURSTING in the room holding his belt in his hand. He YANKS OFF the sheets that Broomhilda sleeps under. Broomhilda lies naked under the covers. Candie brings the belt down around her legs and backside. She hops out of bed. 
INT - HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT Candie CHASES her naked body with his belt, from the top of the stairs, down the stairs, and through the lobby, and out the front door. All to the amusement of the WHITE HOTEL GUESTS. 
EXT - GREENVILLE HOTEL - NIGHT She RUNS out of the hotel naked, and then TRIPS FALLING INTO THE GREENVILLE MUD. She looks up from the mud, at Calvin Candie looking down at her. 
CALVIN CANDIE Welcome to Candyland. We do a SLOW ZOOM into Broomhilda's face. 
NARRATOR (VO) That was four months ago. 
CUT TO 
INT - GREENVILLE SLAVE AUCTION - DAY Back inside the three story Auction Block domed room. The same room Django was sold in at the beginning. Tons of WHITE BUYERS and SELLERS and BLACK SLAVES to be bought or sold fill the big hall. 
ONE MANDINGO SLAVE (BANJO) stands half naked on the auction block. The SELLER' (SHELBY) gives the crowd,a sales pitch about Banjo, and starts the bidding. Many different UGLY WHITE MEN make bids on the big mandingo, including Calvin Candie. Dr.SCHULTZ and DJANGO from a pair of OPERA GLASSES /-. watch Calvin Candie from up above on the 2nd floor landing. FROM Dr.SCHULTZ'S PERSPECTIVE We see Calvin Candie, and his black slave.bodyguard, BARTHOLOMEW, always dressed in a slightly ill fitting three piece suit and bowler hat, among the crowd of buyers at the auction block below. Candie's lawyer LEONIDE MOGUY joins him. Dr.SCHULTZ His name is Calvin Candle, and he is the owner of Candyland. 
DJANGO Candyland? The mandingo fightin' place? Dr.SCHULTZ Oh, so you heard of it? 
DJANGO Ain't no slave ain't heard of Candyland. Dr.SCHULTZ Well apparently, that's where your wife is, and apparently the repellent gentleman down there is the one who owns her. 
ï¿½ï¿½` TIME CUT 
6R The White Man and Black Man find a cubby hole to talk in the auction hall. Dr.SCHULTZ How much do you know about mandingo fighting? 
DJANGO Not so much... A little... Master Carrucan had a couple niggers he'd fight. Dr.SCHULTZ Can you play a mandingo expert? 
DJANGO What? Dr.SCHULTZ Can you convincingly masquerade as someone who is an expert on mandingo fighters? 
DJANGOÂ¢ Why? Dr.SCHULTZ Because when a man has one of the four biggest cotton plantations in Dixie, but the only thing that seems to ring his chimes is big sweaty black males, if WE want to get his attention, we better be talking about big sweaty black males. So my character is that of a big money buyer from Dusseldorf, here in Greenville to buy my way into the mandingo fight game. And your character is the mandingo expert I hired to help me do it. 
DJANGO They call that "One-Eyed Charly." Dr.SCHULTZ. One-Eyed Charly? 
DJANGO That's what you call it when you buy a slave expert. If you wanna raise horses, but don't know nothin' 'about horses, you buy yourself a One-Eyed Charly who knows about horses. He teaches ya. You wanna plant tobacco but don't know nothin' about it, you buy yourself a One-Eyed Charly knows about tobacco. Dr'. SCHULTZ Why do they call it One-Eyed Charly? 
DJANGO You know, back on the plantation, my. job wasn't historian. Dr.SCHULTZ Testy. It's an unusual name. That's a perfectly legitimate question. So, can you convincingly play my mandingo One-Eyed Charly? Don't say, yes, if you can't. 
DJANGO You want me to play a black slaver? There ain't nothin lower then a black slaver. Black slavers are lower then head house niggers, and buddy, that's pretty fuckin low. Dr.SCHULTZ Then play him that way! Give me your black slaver. Django gets that. Dr.SCHULTZ Can you do that? 
DJANGO That, I can do. What's next? Dr.SCHULTZ To get ourselves personally invited to Candyland by Calvin Candie himself. 
CUT TO 
RODNEY No sir. 
DJANGO Then keep ya damn eyeballs off me! Flash that bad look at me again, I'll give ya reason not to like me! As this parade makes progress, Django keeps his emotions in check, but not without difficulty. Dr.Schultz comes riding Fritz beside him. Dr.SCHULTZ How do you like this side of the slave trade? 
DJANGO Not so much. Dr.SCHULTZ Prefer the other side? 
DJANGO I didn't say that. 
Dr.SCHULTZ I've confirmed Broomhilda's at Candyland. 
DJANGO Are you sure it's her? Dr.SCHULTZ He didn't call her by name, but she's a young lady, whip marks on 'her back, and speaks German. Now while it's not wise to assume, in this instance, I think it's pretty safe. 
DJANGO Did you offer to buy her? Dr.SCHULTZ I opened the door to my possible interest. But naturally, sight unseen, I can only be so interested. 
SUDDENLY ... Calvin Candie comes riding up behind them... 
CALVIN CANDLE Am I intruding? Dr.SCHULTZ Of course not. 
CALVIN CANDIE 
(APPRAISING THE 
TWO MEN) I swear you two are cozier then a couple of cuttle fish. Dr.SCHULTZ You'd be surprised what a good conversationalist Django is. 
CALVIN CANDIE Oh by now, I don't think that would surprise meat all. Candie gives Django a creepy smile. Around now the audience may start noticing DOG BARKING in the distance. Dr.SCHULTZ When do we reach your property? 
CALVIN CANDLE You been on it. I own the whole sixty miles 'fore we get to Candyland. Candie gets annoyed at the barking dogs. 
CALVIN CANDIE Excuse me a moment, gentlemen. 
(YELLING BEHIND him at Billy) Billy Crash, git up here! Billy Crash, a hillbilly overseer who's missing his two front teeth, rides up. 
BILLY CRASH Yeah, Boss? 
CALVIN CANDIE Find out what that goddamn commotion is up at the tracker shack! 
BILLY CRASH Right away, Boss. Billy Crash TEARS UP AHEAD on his horse. 
CALVIN CANDIE You know, confidentially, just 'tween us girls, worse things about this business, ain't the slaves. It's all the white trash ya gotta deal with. Like these peckawoods we got riding with us. These dumb, ignorant, sleazy sonsabitches ain't good fer nuttin, except kickin' a niggers ass can't kick back. Yeah, they holdin' the pretty part of the whip, but it's just a thin membrane separate 'em. And don't think they don't know it either. It's about the only thing these dumbass motherfuckers do know. But ya need 'em. Who the hell else ya gonna get to beat a niggers ass, other than somebody might as well be a nigger hisself. But these mountain boys I use as trackers for the runaways, they the worst. Nothin but a buncha goddamn inbreed hillbillies. Now like that nigger gal we was talkin' 'bout. I'm sure it.was a pain in the ass, but with a lot of patience, that German lady taught Hildi how to speak German. Django hears her name himself. His head does involuntary jerk, but his ï¿½, emotions betray nothing. 
PTE 
CALVIN CANDIE 
(CON'T) Now these inbred hillbillies, on the other hand, they can barely speak English. I can't understand a damn word most of 'em say. You could teach a plow horse how to make a pot of coffee, 'fore you teach those fools how to use a knife and fork. I tell ya, if it wasn't for catchin' a nigger on the run, they'd be as useless as tits on a boar hog. Billy Crash comes riding back. 
CALVIN CANDIE What the hell's goin on? 
BILLY CRASH They got 'em a runaway. 
CALVIN CANDIE Who? 
CUT TO 
EXT - TRACKER SHACK - DAY A BUNKHOUSE for the FOUR HILLBILLY TRACKERS (they track down runaway slaves) that live here about forty miles from the Candyland Plantation. A little dog kennel, looks like a chicken coup, sits next to the bunkhouse. The TRACKERS are a hairy, bearded, burly, buck skinned wearing, dirty long haired lot. Their Leader is Mr.,STONESIPHER, the other three are STEW, LEX, and JAKE. The four men could be brothers, or cousins, or father and sons, or just from the same hollow. Lex holds two SNARLING GERMAN SHEPHERDS on a leash. Stew one SNARLING GERMAN SHEPHERD on a leash. And Mr.Stonesipher holds one SNARLING GERMAN SHEPHERD on a leash, the lead dog, that goes by the name of 
MARSHA. A runaway slave named, D'ARTAGNAN, lies belly down in the dirt, surrounded by the four vicious dogs, who BARK, GROWL, and SNAP at him. One look at D'Artagnan tells you he's a mandingo who's been in one fight too many. One of his eyes have been 'poked out. Big BITES have been bit out of both his face and neck (by past fights, human bites, not-the dogs), as well as three fingers have been bit off. Not to mention he's covered in cuts, like he's been drug through a briar patch. 
O V5 The fourth Tracker, JAKE, doesn't engage in the melodrama. He hangs in the background, CUTTING FIREWOOD with a big axe. Calvin Candie, Dr.Schultz, Django, and the whole Candie caravan look down on the runaway slave. Including the five new mandingos, and the three old mandingos who know D'Artagnan. 
CALVIN CANDIE Well I'll be, D'Artagnan. Now boy, why do a fool thing like run off? 
D'ARTAGNAN I can't fight no more, Monsieur Candie. 
CALVIN CANDIE Oh yes you can. You might not be able to win, but your ass can fight. - Mr.Stonesipher, shut these goddamn dogs up, I can't hear myself think! Mr.Stonesipher, yells to Marsha; Mr.STONESIPHER Hush now! Marsha! Marsha, hush up! Marsha, Marsha, hush up! (to the other 
TRACKERS) Take these goddamn dogs away from this nigger, he's just makin' em hungry. The other two YANK the dogs away from the fallen Black Man. 
CALVIN CANDIE How long was he loose? Mr. Stonesipher spits tobacco juice. Mr.STONESIPHER A.night. Day. Half the other night. 
CALVIN CANDIE How far he git off property? Mr.STONESIPHER Bout twenty miles off prop. Pretty fer, considering that limp he got. 
DJANGO'S VOICE (OS) Hey Snowball. 
: Stephen looks up at Django on Tony. 
DJANGO If you wanna know who I am, or the name of my horse, you ask me. 
STEPHEN Just'who the hell you callin' Snowball, horse boy? I'll yank your ass of that goddamn'nag, so goddamn fast - in the mud. 
CALVIN CANDIE Whoa, whoa, whoa, Stephen, let's keep it funny. Django's a Freeman. Stephen jerks a thumb up towards Django. 
STEPHEN This nigger, here? 
CALVIN CANDIE That nigger there. Let me at least introduce the two of. you. Django, this is another cheeky black bugger like yourself, Stephen. Stephen, this is Django. You two should hate each other. Stephen uses'the special privilege he and he alone enjoys amongst the blacks at Candyland. 
STEPHEN Calvin, who the hell is this nigger you feel the need to entertain? 
CALVIN CANDIE Django and his friend in grey, Dr.Schultz are customers, and they are our guests Stephen. And you - you old decrepit bastard... .are to show them every hospitality. Do you understand that? 
STEPHEN I don't know why I gotta - 
CALVIN CANDIE You don't hafta know why, do you understand? 
STEPHEN Yeah yeah yeah, I understand just fine. 
CALVIN CANDIE Good. They're spending the night. Go up in the guest bedrooms and get two ready. 
STEPHEN 
(POINTING AT 
DJANGO) He's gonna stay in the Big House? 
CALVIN CANDIE Stephen, he's a slaver. It's different. 
STEPHEN 
(INCREDULOUS) In the Big House? 
CALVIN CANDIE You gotta problem with that? 
STEPHEN I don't gotta problem, unless you gotta problem with burin' the bed, the sheets, and the pillow cases once this black ass motherfuckers gone! 
CALVIN CANDIE That's my problem, they're mine to burn. Your problem, right now, is making a good impression. And I want you to start solving that problem right now, and git them rooms ready. The Old Man looks up at his Master, and says; 
STEPHEN Yes sir, Monsieur Candie. Stephen limps away to the guest rooms, muttering to'himself. Lara Lee and her ever present shadow, a FAT MAMMY named CORA, comes up to her brother on his horse. 
CALVIN CANDIE Dr.Schultz, this attractive southern belle is my widowed sister, may I present to you, Lara Lee Candie-Fitzwilly. Lara Lee does a southern lady bow. Dr.Schultz lifts his bowler hat, and nods in a grand manner. Dr.SCHULTZ I am Dr.King Schultz, this is my 2nd Django, (Django tips his hat) and these are our horses, Fritz and Tony. Both Fritz and Tony do the head bow. 
Dr.SCHULTZ And it is our great delight to encounter this flaming rose. 
LARA LEE Well aren't you the charming gentlemen. You're not from around here, are you? Dr.SCHULTZ Actually I'm from a far off land, Dusseldorf, to be exact. 
CALVIN CANDIE These two are in the market for a fightin' nigger. So I thought I'd invite 'em down, show 'em my stock. 
LARA LEE We'll all have dinner tonight, right? 
CALVIN CANDIE Half the reason I invited them. I thought you'd find.them as intriguing as I do little sister. Lara Lee looks up at Django, and smiles. All of a sudden THREE WHITE RIDERS ride up on horses, a older one, and two tough looking younger ones. The'older one is the Cap't of the Overseers, ACE WOODY, and his two assistants BROWN and JINGLE BELLS CODY. While Ace is dressed for work on a farm, both Brown and Jingle Bells Cody are peacocks who wear cool cowboy outfits. As Calvin Candie watches the three riders approach, he turns to Dr.Schultz and Django, and says; 
CALVIN CANDIE You know since I started fightin' niggers about eleven years ago, it's been a new lease on'life. And the man ridin' up here now is the man responsible for all my success. Ace and his boys pull their horses up, kicking up dust. Through the dust Ace, Brown, and Jingle Bells Cody eyeball Django and Schultz. 
CALVIN CANDIE Howdy Ace. 
(TO SCHULTZ 
AND DJANGO) This here is my Overseer .Cap't, and nigger fight trainer extraordinaire, Ace Woody. 
Pointing at the two shadows that flank Ace Woody. 
CALVIN CANDIE And that's Brown and that's Jingle Bells Cody. 
(TO ACE) Ace, this here is Dr.Ring Schultz, and Django Freeman, they're big customers with big pockets wanna buy a big nigger. So I brought 'em out here so you could give 'em a little display of our African flesh. Ace takes off his hat, bows from his horse, welcoming them. 
FRED) This one over here? 
CALVIN CANDIE Yes. 
ACE WOODY 
(TO FRED) You Fred? A very scared Fred answers. 
BIG FRED Yes, sir. 
ACE WOODY Well good to meet'cha Fred, I'm'Ace Woody, I'm a man of influence 'round here. Now Fred am I mistaken, or were you already in a kurfuffle? 
CALVIN CANDIE I had 'em fight one of Amerigo's niggers last night. 
'ACE WOODY How is of Amerigo? 
CALVIN CANDIE His nigger lost. 
ACE WOODY 
(TO FRED) Really? You won? 
BIG FRED Yes, sir. 
ACE WOODY Wup'ed his ass? 
CALVIN CANDIE Beat 'em to death. Smiling impressively at Big Fred. 
ACE WOODY 
(TO FRED) Really? 
CALVIN CANDIE He did have fifteen pounds on 'em, but still, he still beat his ass to death. 
ACE WOODY 
(TO FRED) You did? 
BIG FRED) Yes, sir. 
ACE WOODY Good job, boy. Got any more wins in ya? 
BIG FRED Yes, sir. Ace gives Cody a slight head nod, and Cody SHOOTS Big Fred in the back. Candie acts out mock frustration. The remaining three mandingos jump a mile. 
CALVIN CANDIE Now why did you do that? 
ACE WOODY He won his last fight last night. Ace puts his eyes on the three remaining mandingos 
ACE WOODY 
(TO MANDINGOS) Those of you with exceptional ability will find it ain't so bad here. Those of you who don't possess exceptional ability, will wish you did. Ace looks up to Cody on his horse. 
ACE WOODY Run 'em over to the Arena. Git 'em doin push ups. First one gives out, shoot 'em in the head. 
(TO MANDINGOS) Welcome to Candyland, boys! Cody runs the terrified mandingos to the arena. Candie leans over to Schultz and says; 
CALVIN CANDLE We only get about two out of every batch of five fighters we buy. But those two tend to be lucky. Ace Woody hops back up on his horse. 
CALVIN CANDIE You know Mr.Woody, I'm beginning to think that you don't trust my judgement? Ace Woody just smiles at his boss, and says; 
ACE WOODY Oh you know I always trust your judgement, Boss Candie...eventually. He rides off. Stephen limps back to the action. 
CALVIN CANDIE Ahhh, Stephen my boy, rooms ready? 
STEPHEN All ready for your guest and his nigger. Candie'shakes his head in mock frustration. 
CALVIN CANDIE Stephen, you're incorrigible. 
(TO SCHULTZ 
AND DJANGO) Gentlemen, let Stephen show you to your rooms. 
REVENGE MUSIC PLAYS as we move into a Sergio Leone CU of DJANGO'S FACE. Stephen breaks the mood. 
STEPHEN 
(TO DJANGO) You comin', or you wanna sleep in that little box? Django turns his back on the naked Broomhilda and follows Stephen and Dr.Schultz up the front steps of The Big House. 
INT - THE BIG HOUSE - DAY Stephen leads the two guests up the big prominent sweeping staircase in the entry way of The Big House. Then down the hallway with the guest rooms. Dr.Schultz is shown his guest room by Stephen. Schultz enters the room and shuts the door behind him. Stephen takes Django to the room next door, opens the door, and leads him in. 
INT - DJANGO'S GUEST ROOM - DAY A guest room with a big feather bed, dresser drawer with a flowery pitcher of water and basin on top of it. A little bedside table with a lamp and a tiny bell on it. 
STEPHEN This one's yours, boy. That bed's damn nice too. Django walks over to the window, parts the curtains and peers out. Broomhilda's gone. As he looks through the glass, snotty Stephen rattles on in the background. 
STEPHEN Feel free to touch anything you want, cause we burnin' all this shit once you gone. I'll have somebody knock on the door when the demonstration ready. Django sits down on the bed. Stephen turns to leave. 
DJANGO Not so fast. 
STEPHEN I got more important things to do then jaw with you. 
DJANGO Nigger, when I say stop you plant roots. Both the words and the tone stop Stephen dead. He turns around. 
DJANGO This tiny bell on this little table... .is this for you? I ring this, you do fer me? 
STEPHEN Me or somebody. Django reaches over and picks up the bell. (a soft) DING-A-LING 
STEPHEN 
(UNAMUSED) What 'cha want? 
DJANGO I want you to pour some water in that bowl for my wash up. Stephen does what he's told, but with attitude. 
)O' Django shuts the guest room door so the two men are alone. Once Stephen's done, Django stands up from the bed. 
DJANGO Gimmie. Stephen hands him the basin full of water. Django takes it from him. Then throws the water in Stephen's face. The dripping wet old slave can do nothing against this free man. 
DJANGO Whatsamatter Stephen, you don't like that? Django takes his hand and SLAPS the old man hard across the face knocking him to the floor; 
DJANGO That's my kinda bell ringin'. Git up. The old man timidly, slowly, and shaky rises off the floor - as soon as he does - Django SLAPS HIM TO THE FLOOR again. Then Django sits back down on the bed, looking at the old man on the floor below his knees. 
DJANGO I've known me House Niggers like you my whole life. Play your dog tricks with your Massa'. Ya' lip off to him every now an' then, as long as ya' keep it funny. He rolls his eyes and puts up with it, and all the white folks think it's so cute. Meanwhile you got all these niggas round here hoppin' and jumpin' to stay on your good side. Well this time Snowball, you gonna listen to me. You got anymore sass you wanna sling my way, before they give us a mandingo demonstration, I'm gonna give this whole motherfuckin plantation a demonstration, of ME beatin' the BLACK off your ass. I will make you drop your drawers, I'll take off my belt, and I will Wup' your bare ass with it, in front of every nigga on this plantation. And after I do that, let's see you play the rooster round here. 
X07 
STEPHEN Calvin wouldn't. let you do it. 
DJANGO Oh that's right, he gives you first name privileges... . ain't that cute. Sass me me again nigger, see what happen'. Stephen lying on the floor, bites his tongue. 
DJANGO That's what I thought. Now git outta"here. With as much dignity as he can muster, Stephen stands up. Before he leaves, Django tells him;, 
DJANGO When I ring this bell, you better come a runnin'. You - not nobody else. While I'm on this property, you my nigger Snowball. Stephen leaves. Django lies down on the bed. He covers his eyes with his arm. A door joins Django and Schultz's room. The adjoining door opens, and Schultz stands there. Dr.SCHULTZ Was that wise? Django doesn't remove his arm from.his eyes. 
DJANGO He ain't tellin' nobody 'bout that. That's all that needs to be said. 
INT - HALLWAY (BIG HOUSE) - DAY Lara Lee, Cora, and a traumatized, but cleaned up (she's dressed in a domestic maid uniform) Broomhilda stand outside Dr.Schultz's door, after Calvin's sister raps on it. Dr.Schultz opens the door. Dr.SCHULTZ Hello ladies. 
DOG 
LARA LEE Dr.Schultz, may I introduce to you, Hildi. Hildi, this is Dr.Schultz, he speaks German. Dr.SCHULTZ 
(TO BROOMHILDA) I've been informed you do as well. 
BROOMHILDA 
(GERMAN) It would be my, pleasure to speak with you in German. Schultz acts for the benefit of Miss Lara's astonishment. Dr.SCHULTZ Astonishing. 
(IN GERMAN) Please come inside Fraulein. She does, and just'as Lara Lee is to say something, Schultz says, "Thank You very much," and closes the door in her face. Miss Lara looks to her Mammy, and the two women head off nonplussed. 
INT - SCHULTZ'S GUEST ROOM (BIG HOUSE) - LATE AFTERNOON With the door closed, Schultz turns to the weak, frightened, disoriented girl. He gives her a pleasant smile. Dr.SCHULTZ They call you Hildi, but your real name is Broomhilda, isn't it? 
BROOMHILDA Yes. How do you know that? Dr.SCHULTZ Stands to reason who ever taught you German would also give you a German name. Can I pour you a glass of water, Broomhilda? Hearing her name being spoke properly for the first time in awhile, not to mention with a German accent, does have a bit of a calming influence on the frightened girl. 
WE CUT TO DJANGO on the other side of the adjoining door, listening, waiting for his cue to present himself. BACK TO BROOMHILDA AND Dr.SCHULTZ As Dr.Schultz calmly pours the young lady a glass of water, he begins talking to her in GERMAN SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH; Dr.SCHULTZ 
LARA LEE Hildi! Broomhilda snaps back. Instead of getting angry, Candle seems to reflect on that analysis, then issues his own appraisal; 
CALVIN CANDIE Can Eskimo Joe whip Sampson, no. Can he take Goldie, probably not - Goldie's the best dirty fightin' nigger I ever saw. But as long as you don't put 'em up against those two., Eskimo Joe will whip any niggers ass. 
DJANGO Maybe. The Domestics FREEZE for a jerky second when Django says that. 
F Dr.SCHULTZ You must understand, Monsieur Candie, while admittedly a .neophyte in the nigger fight game, I do have a bit of a background in the European traveling circus. Hence, I have big ideas when it comes to presentation. I need something more then just a big nigger. He needs to have panache. A sense of showmanship. I want to be able to . bill. him as. The Black Hercules. I said., and I quote; "I would pay top dollar for the, right nigger." Now I'm not saying Eskimo Joe is the wrong nigger - per se ... but is he right as rain ... ? Everyone waits for Calvin's response. He milks the moment by taking a sip of his mint julep, then says; 
CALVIN CANDIE Dr.Schultz, i will have you know, there is no one in the nigger fight game that appreciates the value of showmanship more then, Monsieur Calvin J. Candie. But one must not forget the most important thing in the nigger fight game. 
(BEAT) A nigger that can win fights. That should be your first, second, third, four, and fifth concern. After you have that, and you know you have that, then, you can start to implement a grande design. But since I enjoy oldest man 'at the table status - beating Moguy by one year for that honor allow the old sage to advise, first things first. Broomhilda comes around with a bowl of string green beans. Dr.Schultz says something pleasant to her in German.. She smiles, and says something pleasant back. 
CALVIN CANDIE I see you two gettin' on? Dr.Schultz breaks into a wide grin; Dr.SCHULTZ .Famously. 
(DRAMATIC PAUSE) Monsieur Candie, you can't imagine what it's like not to hear you native tongue for four years. 
CALVIN CANDIE Hell, I can't imagine two weeks in Boston. 
Everybody at the table chuckles. Dr.SCHULTZ I can't express the joy I felt conversing in my mother tongue. And Broomhilda is a charming conversation companion. As Broomhilda holds the bowl of green beans for Moguy, Lara Lee notices how Django and Broomhilda look and try not to look at each other. Stephen enters the room with a fresh mint julep for Monsieur Candie. 
LARA LEE I don't know doctor, you can lay on all the German sweet talk you want, but it looks like this ponys got big eyes for Django. Lara Lee has no idea how right she is, but when she said it, all three, Django, Broomhilda, and Schultz, involuntarily jerk. 
AND ... .STEPHEN sees it. Schultz covers the jerk with more of his verbal gobbilty gook. Except for Stephen, no one else was the wiser. Broomhilda takes her greenbeans and leaves the dining room for the kitchen. Stephen watches her go, then looks at Django, then hands Candie his mint julep, and goes into a broad routine for the table's benefit. 
CALVIN CANDIE Stephen, you're amazing. I haven't finished a drink in this house in twenty years. 
STEPHEN When a man likes a cold drink, a man likes a COLD drink. Chuckle... . chuckle... 
CALVIN CANDIE Did you overhear that joke I said about me spending two weeks in Boston 
STEPHEN 
(MOCK INDIGNANT) You don't have any idea the work I do to see food gets on the table. 
CALVIN CANDIE What does that hafta do with the price of Tea in China? 
STEPHEN You think when I'm in that kitchen, I got nothin' better to do then listen in here to you tellin' unfunny jokes? Chuckle... . chuckle... 
CALVIN CANDIE 
(MOCK INDIGNATION) What? They laughed! 
STEPHEN Of course they laughed, their parents raised them right. When they're a guest in somebody's house, and the master of of the house thinks he's- funny, you suppose to laugh. They'd be rude not to. Chuckle... .chuckle... They play their little comedy routine for all it's worth. 
CALVIN CANDIE No it was really funny, 
(TO TABLE) wasn't it? 
STEPHEN Now what do you expect these people to say? What you need to do is stop embarrassing your guest. 
(TO TABLE) Everybody don't laugh at him, you're being polite, I understand, you mean well, but it just encourages him. Chuckle-chuckle... As the white folks chuckle, Stephen moves back into the kitchen. 
TNT - KITCHEN (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT Once Stephen enters the kitchen, his smile melts away, and he locks eyes on Broomhilda. He moves over to her. 
STEPHEN You know that nigger? /ï¿½ She spins around. 
BROOMHILDAÂ¢ Who? 
STEPHEN Don't stall me bitch, you know who? 
BROOMHILDA At the table? I don't know him. 
STEPHEN. You don't know him? 
BROOMHILDA No. 
STEPHEN You wouldn't lie to me now, would you? She shakes her head, no. Stephen looks at her skeptical. 
STEPHEN Okay, if you say so. 
BACK TO DINNER TABLE Pick it up again in mid-negotiation. 
STEPHEN Why you cryin'? 
BROOMHILDA Because you're scarin' me. 
STEPHEN Why am I scarin' you? 
BROOMHILDA Because you're scary. Things have become so tense and quiet in the kitchen, that the dinner table conversation begins to bleed inside. We hear Dr.Schultz in the next room say; Dr.SCHULTZ (OS) .to speak German,with Hildi this afternoon was positively soul enriching. Stephen hears this, he's starting to get the idea. 
1ZL His eyes to to Broomhilda. 
STEPHEN You, stay in the kitchen. Stephen moves to the kitchen door, swings it open, and watches Dr.Schultz prepare to proposition Candie for Broomhilda. Stephen knows these two jokers (Django and Schultz) are up to something, and now he's just figured it out. 
INT - DINNER TABLE (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT Dr.SCHULTZ You indicated earlier you would be willing to part with Hildi? 
CALVIN CANDIE Yes siree bob I did. Dr.SCHULTZ Well in that case allow me to propose another proposition? In full "Ole Jimmie" performance, Stephen BARGES in the room, INTERRUPTING Dr.Schultz. 
STEPHEN - Monsieur Candie? 
CALVIN CANDIE Stephen, you just interrupted Dr.Schultz. 
STEPHEN (to Dr.Schultz) Oh, I do apologize, doctor. My hearin' ain't worth a damn these days. 
(TO CANDIE) Monsieur Candie, I need a word with you in the kitchen. 
CALVIN CANDIE What, you mean get outta my chair? 
STEPHEN If you could manage it. It's about dessert. 
CALVIN CANDIE What about dessert? 
STEPHEN I would rather tell you in private. 
CALVIN CANDIE We're having rhubarb pie, what sort of melodrama could be brewing back there? 
Stephen bends down and whispers in his ear; 
STEPHEN Meet me in the library. Well that's a horse of a different color. That means whatever Stephen has to say, hasn't anything to do with rhubarb pie. "Meet me in the library" is their secret signal. 
CALVIN CANDIE Fine friend Stephen, I'll be along momentarily. Stephen exits. Candie stands up from his chair and addresses the table. 
CALVIN CANDIE Well as you can see, talented no doubt as they are in the kitchen, from time to time, adult supervision is required. If you'll excuse me a moment. Candie exits. 
TNT - LIBRARY (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT A masculine sanctuary for Calvin Candie. Walls of perfectly bound books. Stuffed animal heads (deer, boar) that he's shot, sit mounted on the walls. There's comfy red leather chairs and a bar in the globe. When WE CUT TO this room, we cut to Stephen sitting in one of the red leather chairs, drinking a brandy out of a brandy sifter. Calvin enters the room, sees Stephen sitting in the chair, drinking his brandy, and doesn't bat an eye. It appears, in this room, Calvin's and Stephen's life long friendship exits on a different plane. Outside of outside eyes, in this room, all pretense of master and slave is dropped, and the number one and number two.. men of Candyland can talk turkey. 
CALVIN CANDIE What's the matter? 
STEPHEN Those motherfuckers ain't here to buy no mandingos. They want that girl. - 
CALVIN CANDIE What the hell you talkin' about? 
STEPHEN They playin your ass for a fool, that's what I'm talkin' bout. They ain't here for no muscle bound Jimmie, they here for that girl. 
CALVIN CANDIE What girl, Hildi? 
STEPHEN Yeah, Hildi. The niggers know each other. 
CALVIN CANDIE He just bought Eskimo Joe. 
STEPHEN Did he give you any money? 
CALVIN CANDIE Well not yet, but - 
STEPHEN - Then he didn't R ..Y diddly, not yet no how. But he was just about to buy, who he came here to buy, when I interrupted him. Thank you Stephen - you're welcome Calvin. 
CALVIN CANDIE Where you gettin' all this? Why would they go through all that trouble, to. buy a nigger with a chewed up back, ain't worth five hundred dollars? 
STEPHEN Well they're doin' it cause Django's in love with Hildi. She's probably his wife. Now why that German gives a fuck about who that uppity son-of-a--bitch is in love with, I'm sure I don't know. 
CALVIN CANDIE If she's who they want, why the whole snake oil pitch about mandingos? 
STEPHEN Because you wouldn't pay no never mind to four hundred dollar. But twelve thousand got you real friendly. Calvin thinks ... .as per usual, Stephen's right. 
CALVIN CANDIE 
(TO SCHULTZ) Rhubarb pie? Schultz looks at the pie and the man. Dr.SCHULTZ No. 
CALVIN CANDIE Are you brooding 'bout me getting the best of ya? Dr.SCHULTZ Actually, I was thinking of that poor devil you fed to the dogs today, D'Artagnan. And I was wondering what Dumas would make of all this. Calvin hands the doctor the two pieces of paper he needs. Broomhilda's bill of sale, and her freedom papers. As he says the following he examines he papers. 
CALVIN CANDIE Dumas...? Dr.SCHULTZ Alexander Dumas. He wrote "The Three Musketeers." I figured you must be an admirer. You named your slave after that novel's lead character. If Alexander Dumas had been there today, I wonder what he would of made of it? 
CALVIN CANDIE You doubt he'd approve? Dr.SCHULTZ Yes his approval would be a dubious proposition at best. 
CALVIN CANDIE Soft hearted Frenchy? Dr.SCHULTZ Alexander Dumas is black. 
Schultz rises, puts the papers in his back pocket, .looks to his two companions, Django and Broomhilda, and says; Dr.SCHULTZ We got it, let's go. 
(TO CANDIE) Normally Monsieur Candie, I would say, auf wiedersehen. But since what auf wiedersehen actually means is, till I see you again, and since I never wish to see you again, to you sir, I say, goodbye. Schultz begins to cross the room towards the exit. When Calvin says to the German's back; 
CALVIN CANDIE One more moment, Doc! Dr.SCHULTZ What? 
CALVIN CANDIE It's a custom here in the South, once a business deal is concluded, for the two parties to shake hands. It implies good faith. Dr.SCHULTZ I'm not from the South. He turns to leave. 
CALVIN CANDIE You're in my house, doctor, I'm afraid I must insist. This turns Schultz around. Dr.SCHULTZ Insist what...? That I shake your hand before I leave? Then I'm afraid I must insist in the opposite direction. Calvin walks closer to the German doctor. 
CALVIN CANDIE You know what I think you are? Dr.SCHULTZ What you think I am? No I don't. 
CALVIN CANDLE I think you are a bad loser. Dr.SCHULTZ And I think you're an abysmal winner. 
CALVIN CANDLE Never the less, here in Chickasaw County a deal ain't done till the two parties have shook hands. Even after all this paper signin', don't mean shit you don't shake my hand. Dr.SCHULTZ If I don't shake your hand, you're gonna throw away twelve thousand dollars...? I don't think so. Schultz looks to Django and Broomhilda. Dr.SCHULTZ Let's go. 
CALVIN CANDIE Bartholomew, if she tries to leave here before this German shakes my hand. Cut 'er down. Schultz looks to Django... . then to Candle.. .and then with a smile on his face, and a twinkle in his eye, asks 
CANDLE; Dr.SCHULTZ. You really want me to shake your hand? Django gets it. 
CALVIN CANDIE I insist. 
DR -Schultz smiles. Dr.SCHULTZ Well, if you insist. Django goes to stop him... 
The German crosses toward Candie, offering him his hand... Candie offers his hand to Schultz... The small DERRINGER POPS into Schultz's outstretched hand... 
POP! He SHOOTS CALVIN CANDIE in the heart. Candie has a look of shock as blood explodes from his heart, and he falls to the floor. Everybody is stunned. Schultz looks to Django. Django looks back. Dr.SCHULTZ 
(TO DJANGO) I'm sorry. I couldn't resist. Dr.SCHULTZ is BLOWN APART by Bartholomew's SAWED OFF SHOTGUN. The room comes to its senses and attacks Django and Broomhilda. 
FADE TO BLACK 
We FADE UP FROM BLACK to see: The soles of Django's bare feet. A rope is tied around the ankles, and it's obvious he's been strung up, upside down. The CAMERA moves down his naked body, down his legs (we see his wrists are'bound with ropes to his thigh), down his bare buttocks, down his whip scarred back, to the back of his head which hovers just about three inches from the barn yard wooden floor. 
INT - BARN - AFTERNOON Eight year old stable boy, Timmy, wipes the unconscious Django's face with a wet rag. They are all alone in the barn. Django begins to come to ... 
TIMMY 
(SHHH'S HIM) Act like you still sleepin'. 
DJANGO Where's Broomhilda? 
TIMMY Who? 
DJANGO Hildi, the slave girl that ran away a couple of days ago. They had her in The Hot Box. 
TIMMY I don't know 'bout no girl. 
DJANGO How 'bout that German white man I came here with? 
TIMMY Oh he's dead. His body's over there. Django twists upside down on the rope, and sees the corpse of his friend King Schultz dead on the filthy barn yard floor. The sight of the lifeless carcass of the doctor fills Django with pain and anger. Just then head overseer Ace Woody walks in the barn. Upon seeing Ace, Timmy hightails it out of there, Ace throws an empty bucket at the fleeing boy. 
ACE WOODY Git on outta here, boy! 
Django, slightly..swaying to and fro from the rope, looks upside down at Ace Woody, all dressed up in a black suit with a string tie, which makes him look a bit like Wyatt Earp. 
ACE WOODY So y'all bounty hunters,.huh? Django thinks, "How does he know?" 
ACE WOODY I knew there was something fishy 'bout, y'all. We found your wanted posters and book of figures in your saddle bags. I gotta say, ain't never heard of no black bounty hunter before. A black boy paid to kill white men? How did ya like that line of work? Django retorts, upside down. 
STEPHEN Now that fancy talkin' white man of yours didn't know what's what. He still thought his ass hadda chance. But like the One-Eyed Charly you are, you always know the end is near 'fore the white folks. With the ORANGE HOT poker, he BURNS OFF Django's other NIPPLE. The smell of burned flesh smokes in the air. Stephen makes a show of breathing it in his nostrils. 
STEPHEN Damn Nigger, you smell good. He walks behind Django with the poker. 
STEPHEN You know, when you was sittin' on that feather bed in the quest room in the Big House - After you slapped my ass to the floor You were sayin' something 'bout my BARE BLACK ass, and how you were gonna BUST IT. Remember that, Bright Boy? He places the HOT ORANGE END OF THE POKER hard against Django's BARE buttocks. Django SCREAMS! Stephen LAUGHS. Stephen walks away and sticks the poker back in the fire. He goes through Django's clothes and pulls out his tan pants. He tosses them on the floor by the hanging man. 
STEPHEN You leavin', that's what you can take with you. Stephen walks over to the hanging upside down man, and as he talks to him, he begins fondling Django's genitals. 
I31 
STEPHEN Now you were quite the topic of conversation for the last few hours. Seemed like folks never had a bright idea in their life, was comin' up with different ways to kill your ASS. Now most of 'dem ideas involved fuckin wit your fun parts. But while that might SEEM like a good idea. Truth is, once ya snip a niggers nuts, most bleed out. Then I say; "Hells bells, the niggers we send to LeQuint Dickey, got it worse then that." Then they're, "Let's whip 'em to death," "Throw 'em to the mandingos," "Feed 'em to Stonesipher's dogs." And then I say, "What's so special 'bout that? We do that shit all the time. Hells bells, the niggers we send to LeQuint Dickey got it worse then that." He stops massaging Django's balls. 
STEPHEN So Miss Lara got the bright idea of givin' your ass to The LeQuint Dickey Mining Company. And as a slave of The LeQuint Dickey Mining Company, hence forth, till the day you die, you will be swinging a sledgehammer, all day, every day, turning big rocks into little rocks. And trust me when I tell you it's gonna be 'bout as much fun as it sounds. We sell 'em the mandingos ain't good for nuttin' no more. Like them three y'all came back with. For them big garboons we get twenty a piece. They last 'bout six months. Skinny nigger like you, I give two or three. Stephen turns to leave. 
DJANGO Where's Broomhilda? 
STEPHEN She's all right for now. Miss Lara soft hearted on 'er. She gave her to Billy Crash. He was sweet on 'er. Now Billy Crash might not look or smell too good, but ain't nobody gonna bother her. Stephen limps away. 
CUT TO 
EXT - CANDYLAND - AFTERNOON The Caravan coming from The LeQuint Dickey Mining Company comes riding up to the plantation. It comes equipped with one CAGE WAGON (from a prison), ONE white trash PECKAWOOD named FLOYD to drive the wagon, a 2nd white trash PECKAWOOD named ROY to ride lead horse, and a white trash PECKAWOOD named JANO to bring up the rear riding horses ass, plus a pack horse that carries dynamite for the mine. The three peckawoods, who all talk with thick Australian accents, have stopped the caravan and are having a powwow. 
ROY It's chaos 'round here. Some bastard shot the big boss. Let's git the niggers and git out. The Three mandingos who weren't sold in Greenville, Rodney, Chicken Charly, and Chester are walked to the wagon by overseers Tommy Giles. and Broomhilda's new owner Billy Crash. All three slaves carry the bundles of personal belongings they've had since Greenville. Chester wears a hat, and Chicken Charly has a corncob pipe in his mouth. The wagon driver, Floyd, approaches them. 
FLOYD You blacks line up. They do. 
FLOYD What's your names? 
CHESTER Chester. 
CHICKEN CHARLY Chicken Charly. 
RODNEY Rodney. 
FLOYD I'm.Floyd, this is Roy, and that's Jano. 
(POINTING AT 
CHESTER'S BUNDLE) What's that? 
CHESTER It's my stuff. 
FLOYD Throw it in the dirt. 
All three throw their only belongings in the dirt. Floyd takes the'hat off of Chester's head and sails it away. As well as ripping the corncob pipe out of Chicken Charly's mouth and tossing it in the dirt. 
FLOYD (to Chicken Charly) You won't be doin' much smokin' mate. (to all three) You are now the property of The LeQuint Dickey Mining Company. Git in the cage. This is going to be worse then the three even thought. They climb into the cage wagon. Floyd locks it behind them. Roy, the head Aussie, pays Billy Crash for the slaves, when we hear Ace Woody call out; 
ACE WOODY (OS) Hold on, we got another hammer swinger for ya. Ace Woody comes walking out of the barn with Django, shirtless and barefoot (just like we met him at beginning of the story), wearing his old tan pants, and his wrists bound by a rope. 
ROY We can't use that skinny bastard. 
ACE WOODY We got an arraignment with Mr.Dickey to take punishment niggers from time to time. 
ROY No one tole' me 'bout no arraignment. 
ACE WOODY Well if Mr.Dickey ain't takin' you into his confidence, I'm sure I don't know why. 
ROY Look, no one tole' me 'bout - 
ACE WOODY - No, you look peckawood, this nigger got Boss Candie killed. And we want his ass punished. Now I know you need our bucks. So.unless you wanna ride back to the mine, and tell Mr.Dickey how and why you fucked up our nice little business relationship, take this nigger and hush up about it! 
ROY Fine, stick 'em in the goddamn cage. 
"H Django sees the three mandingos in the cage. They see him too. Django stops Ace Woody. 
DJANGO Whoa whoa whoa, you can't put me in there with them. They'll kill me. What about all that -turning big rocks into little rocks- shit y'all was. talkin' about? I mean that was the idea ain't it? You put me in there with them big ass garboons they kill me on the way. I mean if that's the idea, that's the idea, but I didn't think that was the idea. Ace knows he's right, so he turns to Roy and Floyd. 
ACE WOODY He can't go in there with them. 
FLOYD Why not? 
DJANGO Back at that plantation Candyland, there was an eleven thousand five hundred dollar fortune just sittin there, and y'all rode right past it. 
JANO You be damned, blackie. We're not bandits. 
DJANGO That's what's nice about this fortune, it's not illegal. You can't steal it, ya gotta earn it. 
JANO If you got something to say, say it. 
DJANGO The eleven thousand five hundred dollar fortune waiting for you back at Candyland, is in the form of a wanted dead or alive bounty on Smitty Bacall and the Smitty Bacall Gang. 
JANO Who the fuck is Smitty Bacall? 
DJANGO Smitty Bacall is the leader of a murdering gang of stagecoach robbers, The Bacall Gang. There's a seven thousand dollar dead or alive bounty on him. And one thousand five hundred dollars for each of his three accomplices, Dandy Michaels, Gerald Nash, and Crazy Craig Koons. And all four of them gentlemen are sittin back there at Candyland...laughin their ass off... cause they just got away with murder. 
(BEAT) But it don't hafta be that way. You and your mates could get that money. 
JANO Who pays the money? 
DJANGO The Court. 
JANO The Court? 
DJANGO The Austin Texas Courthouse. Oh, and by the way, the court don't give a damn about how you kill 'em. You can shoot 'em in the back, from up on a hill, in the back of the head, in their sleep - don't matter. 
(CON'T) 
DJANGO 
(CON'T) Court doesn't care how you do it, just as long as you do it. 
JANO They.pay us to kill 'em? 
DJANGO No. You kill 'em, and they payyou for the corpse. Get it? 
JANO I think so... . what did these jokers do again? 
DJANGO Killed innocent people in a stagecoach robbery. I've got the handbill in my pocket. Django digs into his tan pants and pulls out the folded up Smitty Bacall handbill that Dr.Schultz told him to hang on to for good luck. He hands it to Jano. 
JANO What's this? 
DJANGO I told you, it's the handbill for Smitty Bacall and The Bacall Gang. Jano looks at the handbill. 
DJANGO Whatsamatter, can't you read? 
JANO I can read, I just don't have my glasses. I didn't take 'em with me, because I didn't think I'd be doin much readin' on a nigger run. 
DJANGO What about that cowboy fella in the lead? 
JANO Roy? 
DJANGO Can Roy read? 
JANO Look, get it straight black, I can fuckin read. I just don't got my glasses. 
CUT TO 
EXT -- BEAUTIFUL MISSISSIPPI COUNTRY TABLEAUX at DUSK The LeQuint Dickey Mining Co. Caravan has stopped, and pulled over to the side of the road. 
IN THE CAGE Rodney, Chicken Charly, and Chester sit in the cage, and watch through the bars this new turn of events without any.clear comprehension of what they're watching. What the three caged men are watching is the three Australian mining company employees and Django, off in the distance (where they can't hear what they're saying), having some sort of a discussion. That includes the still bound by the wrists Django showing the three men a piece of paper. 
INSERT: SMITTY BACALL'S WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE HANDBILL Roy holds it in his hand as he reads and Django talks. 
DJANGO I ain't no goddamn slave. Do I sound-like a fuckin slave? I'm a bounty hunter. Yesterday as a free man, I rode into Candyland on a horse with my white German partner, Dr.King Schultz. We'd tracked The Bacall Gang from Texas all the way to Chickasaw County. Found them laying low at Candyland. We went in to get 'em, things went sour. My partner was killed, and Calvin Candie was shot. Everybody there decided to blame me, so here I am. 
(TO ROY) You know I'm not on the manifest? All of you know I'm not suppose to be on this trip. But those four men, are still back there. They're still wanted. And that eleven thousand five hundred is still up for grabs. And the last thing they'd expect is y'all rid.in back and gittin it. Django is damn convincing. 
ROY What's your deal? You tell us who they are and we let ya go? 
DJANGO I ain't tellin' who they are. But, you give me a pistol, and a horse, and five hundred dollars of that eleven thousand five hundred, and I'll point 'em out to you. He's got these greedy sonsabitches right on the hook...he just needs one little push. 
1Q7 
ROY We'll give you that pack horse. 
DJANGO What's them saddle bags filled with? 
FLOYD Dynamite. 
!so 
DJANGO I.ain't ridin no horse with no goddamn dynamite on his back! 
ROY 
(CHUCKLE CHUCKLE) Yeah, I can see why. Jano take those sticks off that horse, and stick 'em in the nigger cage. Jano does this, lifting two out of four bags filled with dynamite off the pack horse, and walking to the cage wagon, unlocking ' the cage door, and placing the bags inside. The Black Men in the cage don't like this at all. Jano removes the last of the dynamite filled saddle bags from Django's horse, throws them over his shoulders, and begins walking back to The Cage Wagon. Django moves to his new pack horse, and says; 
DJANGO Where's my pistol? 
ROY Floyd, you got that rifle on the wagon, give 'em your gun and your belt. Floyd unbuckles his gun belt, gun and all, folds it up, and walks over to Django handing it to him. Django accepts it. About the pistol, Floyd tells Django; 
FLOYD Now don't drop it now. I just had the sights fixed last month, it's perfect. Django holding the gunbelt in his hand. 
DJANGO That's good to know. Without taking the pistol out of the gunbelt, DJANGO SHOOTS FLOYD TWICE in the chest... Roy turns around... Django takes the gun out of the holster... . BAM...ROY is HIT in the UPPER BRAIN AREA and falls to the grass dead. Jano goes for the gun on his hip. Django SHOOTS ONE OF THE SADDLE BAGS over.Jano's shoulder...KAHBOOM!!!!! 
Jano is BLOWN TO SMITHEREENS... The KAHBOOM knocks Django on his ass... The CAGE WAGON Rodney, Chester, and Chicken Charlie come down from the shock of the blast. The image outside the bars of their cage is of DUST and SMOKE in the air, obscuring all visibility... 
THEN ... A sudden GUST OF WIND comes and BLOWS all the smoke and dust away, REVEALING in bright color focus... .DJANGO standing among the two dead Aussies, and whatever is left of Jano. He's shoeless and shirtless, but Floyd's pistol and gunbelt sit wrapped around his waist. He locks eyes with the three men in the cage.. He then moves towards the wagon, and unhooks the mine company beast, and climbs aboard him bareback. He leans over and snatches the RIFLE that Floyd kept on the wagon seat next to him. Grabbing a fistful of the horses mane, he digs his heels into the beast's side. The pack animals SPRINGS TO LIFE under the new rider. By now it should be apparent that Django brings the best out of horses, and horses bring the best out of Django. From his high horse Django looks down at The Three Caged Men... 
.THEN... Using the rifle in a QUICK ONE HANDED MOVE he SHOOTS the lock on the cage door. He looks at the three men, especially Rodney, then says; 
DJANGO Throw up that dynamite. Rodney grabs a saddle bag full of dynamite and tosses it to Django on his Horse. Django wraps it around the Horse's neck, turns the beast around, and without saying another word, rides back in the direction of Candyland. The Three NOW FREE Mandingos, watch him ride away. "Who was that nigger?" 
CUT TO 
l.rz A GORGEOUS BIG SKY SOUTHERN PURPLE AND ORANGE SUNSET WE PAN DOWN from the sky and see in small black silhouette the Funeral Procession of Calvin Candie carrying the Coffin of the former Master up the hill on 'Candyland that leads to the Graveyard. A WHITE PREACHER walks out in front of the Procession. Then comes Calvin Candie's Coffin carried by eight pallbearers, Stephen, Moguy, Bartholomew, Ace Woody, Brown, Cody, and his best mandingos SAMSON and GOLDIE. The first mourner in line is Lara Lee dressed in a fancy black dress, wide brim black hat, black veil, and ever present black Mammy (Cora) crying at her side. 
CORA The sky's real pretty Miss Lara. Monsieur Candie think it real nice. 
LARA LEE Ah, bless you sweet innocent Cora. 
WE CROSS CUT WITH SHOTS of Django RIDING THE HORSE on the way back to Candyland. The bare backed black man riding the horse bareback, holding the RIFLE in one hand, a fistful of the horses mane in the other, hauling ass against a gorgeous SUNSET SKY, looks like an Indian. 
EXT - TRACKER SHACK/BUNKHOUSE - SUNSET The same GORGEOUS SUNSET SKY over the same shitty Tracker shack -Bunkhouse that Mr.Stonesipher and his three obscure companions share. The GERMAN SHEPHERDS (including Marsha) rest in the chicken wire kennel next to the bunkhouse. 
INT - TRACKER SHACK - SUNSET The FOUR TRACKERS are.missing the funeral, hanging out in the bunkhouse wearing their beards. Mr.Stonesipher, Lex, and Stew are playing a mountain card game which looks like poker, except the way you get rid of your cards is different. Instead of chips they play with, "NIGGER EARS" (yes, the ears of slaves). On a second viewing the audience may notice that some of the slaves at Candyland are missing one ear. Jake, the biggest, is off by himself, pounding nails into a small delicate BIRDHOUSE he's making. 
EXT - WOODS-OUTSIDE THE SHACK - SUNSET INSERT: HORSE HOOFS walking then stopping. Django's bare feet jump on to the ground. 
IS3 
INT - DOG KENNEL - SUNSET The FOUR DOGS lay out... . when, Marsha hears something, and raises her head... 
SHIRTLESS DJANGO moves quietly through the woods. 
MARSHA rises to all fours, to listen and smell. out in the darkness, her three PALS continue to lay out. 
DJANGO BY A TREE he can see the bunkhouse entrance, the LONG HANDLE AXE buried in the chopping block, the kennel, and the one dog looking his way. 
MARSHA 
BARK! The Other Three Dogs wake up, and go on alert. Django disappears. 
INT - TRACKER SHACK - SUNSET They hear the barking inside. Mr.STONESIPHER Jake! Jake building his birdhouse. 
JAKE Yeah? Mr.STONESIPHER Check on Marsha. Jake, the one not playing the game, puts aside his hammer, and rises to check on them (these guys are very sensitive about their dogs). 
EXT - TRACKER SHACK As the BARKING gets louder, WE SEE A CLOSE UP of The Axe in the chopping block, and Django's hand REMOVING IT. 
JAKE opens the bunkhouse door-he sees directly a hundred feet in front of him, Django standing there with the axe. Just as he reacts... 
DJANGO ... . THROWS THE AXE... 
JAKE ... . IT HITS HIM IN THE FACE. 
BROOMHILDA I can't help it! I'm really sad! He hops off her and yells at her. 
BILLY CRASH Well goddamit, you're a nigger! Life is sad for niggers! Git use to it! 
(CALMING DOWN) Look you know Me, Hildi. I'm an ass buster from way back. But you know I've always been sweet on you. I don't wanna bust your ass. So don't make me! Now I'm gonna go shit. You calm down. He exits the shack to go the outhouse, leaving Broomhilda alone. WE MOVE INTO A CLOSE UP OF BROOMHILDA lying on the bed. She cries for Django, she cries for herself... 
.THEN... She HEARS an IMPACT SOUND, and a MUFFLED "Ooomph" SOUND. And through the spaces in the wooden planks that act as walls in Billy Crash's shack, she sees a figure fall to the ground. Then she sees another figure through the wooden planks move towards the front door. 
CU BROOMHILDA Her face, stained with tears, watches the door. A soft "Knock Knock" on the door. 
BROOMHILDA 
(SOFTLY) Yes? The VOICE on the other side of the door, says; 
DJANGO'S VOICE (OS) Hey Little Trouble Maker. 
She hops out of bed, and throws open the door... 
THERE HE IS, she runs into his arms. EXT - The FUNERAL - NIGHT The TWO OLD SLAVE.GRAVE DIGGERS are throwing the first shovelfuls of dirt on Monsieur Calvin J. Candie's coffin. The participants of this ritual, begin to move away from the grave. The funeral is a private affair, just the Candie Family Unit, some of the overseers, and the slaves. No one from town, except the Preacher. The SLAVE MOURNERS begin. to move towards their living area, all saying goodbye to Miss Lara. Miss Lara makes a big show of saying goodbye to them. A little cognizant of the Candie Family unit begin the walk off the hill back to the big house. 
EXT - BILLY CRASH'S SHACK - NIGHT Django with Broomhilda. Billy Crash lies dead in the B.G., Stonesipher's Buck Knife buried deep in his chest. He hands Broomhilda her papers. 
DJANGO Here's your bill of sale, and freedom papers. No matter what happens to me, hold on to these and get out of the south. 
BROOMHILDA What's gonna happen to you? 
DJANGO Ain't nuttin' gonna happen to me honey, I'm just sayin'. Now go to the stable, little Timmy's got our horses .saddled. Your horse is named Fritz. He's a damn fine horse. Meet me around the side of the big house. 
BROOMHILDA But what about you - 
DJANGO - Don't worry about me. I'll see you, with Timmy and the horses, by the big house. He sends her on her way. Django looks up and sees the silhouettes of the funeral party walking down hill heading back for the big house. 
EXT - The TRAIL BACK TO The BIG HOUSE - NIGHT The Family unit of The Late Calvin Candie and his sister Lara Lee walk back to The Big House for a drink. This Candie Family Unit consists of: LARA LEE (unarmed) in her black flowing funeral dress. CORA (unarmed) her mammy, walks with Miss Lara, holding her hand. STEPHEN. (unarmed) dressed in his fancy black velvet version of his normal House Nigger outfit, walks on the other side of his mistress Miss Lara, holding her other hand. ACE WOODY (armed with a gun belt.around his hip) dressed in his Wyatt Earp like funeral black suit, with the string tie, walks by himself. LEONIDE MOGUY (armed with a gun belt around his hip) walks by himself. BARTHOLOMEW (unarmed) dressed in his tight fitting business suit, with his hat, walks alone. BROWN and JINGLE BELLS CODY (both armed with guns on their hips) both dressed slightly like cowboy peacocks, walk together. and finally, SAMSON and GOLDIE (unarmed) Calvin Candie's two prized mandingos, wearing suits they borrowed from Bartholomew.. This CANDIE FAMILY UNIT walk to The Big House for a few post funeral drinks. They enter the lawn in front of The Big House, and head for the front door. Broomhilda on Fritz and Timmy riding on Tony come along the side of the property by some shed. They see The Candie Family Unit, all dressed in their darkest finery, walking towards the front steps of The Big House. The woman and little boy stop. But the group of enemies aren't looking their way. The CANDIE FAMILY UNIT moves closer towards the front of The Big House... 
WHEN ... The front of The Big House 
EXPLODES! knocking the.Candie Family Unit flat on their collective asses. BROOMHILDA and TIMMY can't believe their eyes. 
I6 I 
WOOD - STONE - PLASTER - DIRT - DUST - GLASS - SMOKE - GUNPOWDER hang in the air. The CANDIE FAMILY UNIT starts coming to their senses. Nobody was killed, or even seriously hurt (unless you count eardrums), just stunned. As their minds try and grasp with what just happened, their eyes look up from the ground, and try and see through the smoke and dust. The'SMOKE and DUST thins a little, and we see inside the smoke the mansion has been obliterated, but The Big House front steps remain. CUE cool MUSIC. STEPHEN sees something in the smoke, squints. ACE WOODY sees something in the smoke, squints. BROWN and CODY see something in the smoke, squint. In the SMOKE and DUST we begin to see a FIGURE, walking towards them. ACE WOODY squints at the FIGURE. MOGUY sees the.FIGURE. CORA attending to Miss Lara sees the FIGURE, then MISS LARA sees it. The FIGURE moves further out of the SMOKE and DUST. ACE WOODY, on the ground, his hand starts to move towards the gun around his waist. Then he sees The FIGURE.is carrying something in his left hand... .it's Floyd's Winchester, he raises it, and points it at Ace. ACE WOODY's hand moves away from his gun. The FIGURE steps out of the SMOKE. It's DJANGO dressed in his DJANGO 
OUTFIT. STEPHEN, ACE WOODY, MOGUY, LARA LEE, BARTHOLOMEW, CORA, BROWN and JINGLE BELLS CODY, SAMPSON or GOLDIE...Nobody can believe Django's standing there. He stands at the top of the front steps of The Big House, looking down at The Candie Family Unit, all lying on the front lawn, Winchester rifle held casually in his left hand. His right hand held casually by the gun on his hip. The CANDIE FAMILY UNIT all on their ass in the grass, look up at Django with a mixture of Wonder, Fear, and Hate. 
ICZ 
WE MOVE INTO A ROMANTIC CLOSE UP OF BROOMHILDA as she watches this. As DJANGO looks out at the ten stunned enemies spread out on The Big House front lawn,. and as they look back from the grass at him. The black man in the cool green jacket says; 
DJANGO I bet I.know what you're thinkin', Ace Woody? You'.re thinkin', why didn't I'cut off that niggers nuts when .1 had the'chance? Right? 
ACE WOODY I guess I shoulda'. 
DJANGO Yes you should of. He points the Winchester at the people spread out on the grass. 
DJANGO Everybody stand up! It's now Django who gives the orders. They stand up quickly. Django, with the rifle pointing at them, just looks at The Candie Family Unit. Enjoying their collective hatred. 
THEN... He tosses the rifle away. Then moves his right hand by his gun belt in his holster, as he takes a 
SHOWDOWN STANCE. EVERYBODY realizes DJANGO's intentions. Even BROOMHILDA and TIMMY. DJANGO looks down from his position at the top of The Big House steps at the ten people, and says; 
DJANGO All black folks, take ten steps away from the white folks. DJANGO's eyes go to STEPHEN, who looks back at him. 
DJANGO Not you Stephen. You're right where you belong. 
The Black Folks, Cora, Bartholomew, Samson, and Goldie begin taking ten steps away from the White Folks and the gunfight. LARA LEE can't believe Cora's leaving her. CORA is "I'm sorry Miss Lara, but I never did nuttin' to that nigger." DJANGO looks to STEPHEN, and takes Schultz's hidden Derringer out of his pocket. 
DJANGO 
(TO STEPHEN) Let's see if you can handle this as well as you can my nuts? He tosses the Ole Man the tiny gun. 
DJANGO

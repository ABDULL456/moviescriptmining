EX MACHINA 
Written by 
Alex Garland 
Music starts. 
OPEN ON - 
INT. OFFICE - DAY 
- a COMPUTER MONITOR. 
Lines of code appear, as they are typed. 
main( ) { extrn a, b, c; putchar(a); putchar (b);putchar (c); putchar('!'*n'); a `hell'; b `o, w'; c `or 
CUT TO - 
- a view above an ultra-cool, ultra-designed open-plan office. 
In a kitchen area, young men and women mill and chat. Casually dressed. Feels like an intelligent, relaxed environment. 
Behind them, more young men and women sit at desks, in front of screens and keyboard. 
Each workstation is personalised. Photographs of friends or family, or pets. Cutting from magazines. Ironic superhero/video-game figurines. 
CUT TO - 
- the hands of the young man writing code.   This is CALEB. He types fast, with two fingers. 
CUT TO - 
- EXTREME CLOSE UP of a pinhole web-cam lens in CALEB'S monitor. 
CUT TO - 
- the POV of the web-cam. 
Looking back at CALEB. 
Twenty four. Glazed. Ear buds in, connected to cell phone. Head bobbing slightly to the music. 
As we watch from the monitor POV, we can see the computer's facial recognition system in operation. 
Imaged as vector boxes, which track CALEB'S face, and the faces of all the people behind him. 
CUT TO - 
- the COMPUTER MONITOR. 
On which a message appears, in a small window, over the code. 
VIP EMAIL RECEIVED subject: HIDDEN 
CUT TO - 
- the monitor web-cam POV. 
As CALEB stops typing. 
He gazes at the message. 
Then clicks on the link. Then mouths the word: Fuck. 
CALEB reaches for his cell phone. 
CUT TO - 
- the CELL PHONE POV, seen from the tiny camera above the screen, as CALEB lifts the phone, and starts keying-in a text. 
We see facial recognition software flickering over CALEB'S features, and reacting to shifts in his expression. 
CUT TO - 
- the cell phone. The screen.   The tiny camera nestled above it. Lens glinting. 
On the screen, a time-bar extends next to the word: 
sending 
A beat later, a reply text message appears. 
WTF?   seriously!? 
CUT TO - 
- the WEB CAM POV, watching CALEB react to the arrival of the text. 
CUT TO - 
- cell phone screen. 
CALEB sends the word: 
yes 
A beat later, a stream of text messages start appearing: 
Buena estoria bro 
omfg fucking AWESOME 
:o) 
take me take me?!? 
Caleb > [infinity symbol] 
A white-water river runs through it. 
INT. HELICOPTER - DAY CALEB looks down at the breathtaking view as the helicopter banks, turns, and descends. 
EXT. MEADOW/LANDING SITE - DAY 
Meadow flowers whip in the rotor wash as the helicopter touches down in the vast meadow. 
By the landing site is a collection of huge metal crates. All have Chinese characters on the side. 
The rotor blades slow, but don't stop. 
JAY exits. 
EXT. MEADOW/LANDING SITE - DAY 
JAY holds open the door as CALEB exits the helicopter cabin. 
CALEB looks around, his eyes adjusting to the bright sunshine outside. 
JAY goes to the side of the helicopter, pops open a hatch, and removes CALEB'S luggage. A large suitcase with wheels. 
CALEB looks around. Apart from the packing crates, there are no man-made structures to be seen. 
CALEB shouts over the engine noise. 
CALEB You're leaving me here? 
JAY This is as close as I'm allowed to the building. 
CALEB ... What building? 
The pilot gestures vaguely towards the white water. 
JAY Follow the river. 
JAY hands CALEB his bag. 
JAY (CONT'D) Please get a safe distance from the blades. 
The pilot gets back inside the helicopter, and closes the door. 
CALEB hurriedly retreats with his bag. Moments later, in a roar of wind and noise, the helicopter is lifting off. 
Equally suddenly, the noise is fading, and the helicopter is soaring upwards, and banking back towards the glacier. 
Then it is gone.    Bird song and wind rush replace engine noise. 
CALEB suddenly looks very isolated. 
EXT. RIVER - DAY 
CALEB walks along the banks of the fast-flowing river, awkwardly bumping his wheeled suitcase over the ground. 
The banks of the river start to climb, to an intimidating drop. 
It feels that this can't be the right way. 
CALEB reaches into his pocket and pulls out his mobile phone. 
No signal at all. 
He puts his phone back in his pocket. 
EXT. RIVER/HOUSE VIEW - DAY 
CALEB rounds a bend in the river. 
Ahead, almost hidden in trees, there is a steel and glass structure. 
EXT. CLEARING - DAY 
CALEB walks towards the house through the trees. 
In the ground, in a grassy clearing, he finds a circular window, reflecting the sky. 
He walks up to the window, and looks inside. 
It reveals what is effectively a glass-covered well - about four metres deep, with smooth concrete sides. 
At the bottom of the well is a brightly-lit room, which appears to be an office of some sort. There is a desk, with monitors, and a chair. 
But apparently no one inside. 
Beyond the clearing, in the tree-line, CALEB sees - almost camouflaged by forest - the dark shapes and straight lines of a low, one storey building complex. 
12A                                                              12A EXT. HOUSE - DAY 
CALEB approaches the building. 
As he nears the entrance - 
- CALEB startles, as an AUTOMATED VOICE speaks to him, from an unknown source. 
AUTOMATED VOICE Caleb Smith. 
CALEB tracks the source of the voice. 
Near what seems to be the front door, a pillar protrudes from the ground. Head-height. With a GLASS SCREEN on one side. 
Below the screen is a DISPENSER. 
CALEB ... Yes. 
AUTOMATED VOICE Please approach the console and face the screen. 
CALEB looks into the screen, and as soon as he has locked eyes with his own reflection, the screen FLASHES. A single bright strobe. 
Almost immediately afterwards, something small clatters into the DISPENSER. 
NATHAN I like you. 
CUT TO - 
INT. HOUSE/OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY 
- what appears to be a neon coloured jellyfish. Tendrils like axons, hanging in a black-blue liquid space. 
REVEAL - 
- the jellyfish is contained in a glass orb. Which is held in an exposed cavity at the back of machined skull-shape... 
... which is part of a robot girl. 
Her name is AVA. 
She's an extraordinary piece of engineering. 
Proportioned as a slender female in her twenties, her limbs and torso are a mixture of metal and plastic and carbon fibre. 
The carbon fibre is charcoal colour. The plastic is cream. The metal has the yellow-warmth of nickel. 
The shapes of her body approximate the form of muscle.   There are biceps, and breasts. Her hands have five delicate digits. 
Her body-structure is covered in a delicate skin. The skin is a mesh, in the pattern of a honeycomb. Like a spiderweb, it is almost invisible unless side-lit. 
The one part of her that is not obviously an inorganic construct is her face - which is that of a strikingly beautiful girl. Created in a defined oval, from the top of the forehead to just below her chin. Indistinguishable from a real girl in its appearance and in the way it moves - except for one thing. 
There is a very slight, almost imperceptible blankness in her eyes. 
As we observe AVA, she fits a section of skull-plate to the back of her head, which obscures the glass orb and jellyfish structure. 
Then - 
- she half turns. As if having become aware of another presence in the room. 
REVEAL - 
- the room in which AVA stands. 
AVA'S living area is made up of three primary spaces. 
The main area is the OBSERVATION ROOM. A large area, arranged around a glass box, from which she can be viewed. 
At the back of the observation room, behind a sheet of semi- opaque glass, is the PRIVATE AREA. This contains a bed-like structure, a desk, a wardrobe, and a mirror. And behind the private area is the GARDEN AREA. This is a small decorative indoor garden, lit by lamps. The garden is sealed off from AVA by a thick wall of glass. 
There are also several oval discs positioned around the room, made of some kind of dark non-reflective material. These are induction plates. 
And there is a chair, which faces the glass observation box. 
And facing that chair, inside the observation box, is another chair. 
Beside which, CALEB stands. 
A beat - 
- as CALEB and AVA see each other for the first time. 
Then - 
- AVA starts walking. Revealing a secondary impact of her engineering: how she moves. The unconscious precision of her steps. The fluidity of her action. 
CALEB is transfixed as she covers the length of the room to her chair. 
Then she sits down. 
And speaks. 
AVA Hello. 
Her voice has no digital inflections.    It is just the voice of a girl. 
CALEB gathers himself. 
CALEB ... Hi. 
AVA Who are you? 
CALEB I'm Caleb. 
AVA Hello, Caleb. 
CALEB ... Do you have a name? 
AVA Yes.     Ava. CALEB ... I'm pleased to meet you, Ava. 
AVA I'm pleased to meet you too. 
CALEB sits opposite her. 
He is alone on his half of the glass.    Nathan is nowhere to be seen. 
But on the ceiling, and attached to the walls, on both sides of the glass, there are several CCTV cameras. Trained variously on CALEB and AVA. Lenses twitching. 
CUT BACK to AVA. 
She watches CALEB.    Then cocks her head slightly to the side. 
AVA (CONT'D) Are you nervous? 
CALEB frowns. 
CALEB ... Why do you ask that? 
A beat. 
Then AVA repeats her question. 
AVA Are you nervous? 
AVA Good. 
EXT. HOUSE/GARDEN - DUSK 
A view of the house over the meadows. 
The sun setting is behind the mountain peaks, making the edges of the clouds glow like light-bulb filaments. 
INT. HOUSE/DINING AREA - DUSK 
CALEB and NATHAN are in the dining area. It is set for dinner.   Only two chairs. 
NATHAN is at the table, nursing a bottle of Peroni beer. 
CALEB stands by panoramic window, looking at the view. 
NATHAN So? 
CALEB turns. 
CALEB Sorry. I was just ordering my thoughts. 
NATHAN Don't order. Just speak. 
CALEB She's fascinating. When you talk to her, you're through the looking glass. 
NATHAN nods.    Approving. 
NATHAN `Through the looking glass'. You've got a way with words there, Caleb. You're quotable. 
CALEB Actually, it's someone else's quote. 
NATHAN You know I wrote it down. That other line you came up with. About how if I've created a conscious machine, I'm not man. I'm God. 
CALEB ... I don't think that's exactly what I said. 
NATHAN doesn't seem to hear. 
NATHAN I just thought - fuck. That's so perfect. It's so good for the story, when we get to tell it. `I turned to Caleb, and he was looking back at me. And he said: you're not a man, you're a God'. 
CALEB But I didn't say that. NATHAN Whatever it was you said.    I wrote it down. 
As a kind of punctuation mark, NATHAN downs the remains of his beer. Then stands, and gets another from the bar. 
NATHAN (CONT'D) So anyway. First impressions: you're impressed. 
CALEB Yes.   Although - 
NATHAN laughs. 
NATHAN `Although'? There's a qualification to you being impressed? 
CALEB No! No qualification to her. Just - in the Turing test, the machine should be hidden from the examiner. And there's a control, or - 
NATHAN waves a hand. 
NATHAN I think we're past that. If I hid Ava from you, so you just heard her voice, she would pass for human. (MORE) NATHAN (CONT'D) The real test is to show you she is a robot. Then see if you still feel she has consciousness. 
CALEB I think you're probably right. Her language abilities are incredible. The system is stochastic, right? 
NATHAN looks at CALEB blankly. 
CALEB (CONT'D) Non-deterministic. 
NATHAN still says nothing. 
CALEB presses on. 
CALEB (CONT'D) At first I thought she was mapping from internal semantic form to syntactic tree-structure, then getting linearised words. But then I started to realise the model was probabalistic, with statistical training - or at least some kind of hybrid. 
Silence. 
CALEB (CONT'D) ... No? 
NATHAN Caleb. I understand you want me to explain how Ava works. But - I'm sorry. I don't think I'll be able to do that. 
CALEB Try me! I'm hot on high-level abstraction, and - 
NATHAN (cuts in) It's not because you're too dumb. It's because I want to have a beer and a conversation with you. Not a seminar. 
CALEB ... Oh.   Sorry. 
NATHAN It's cool. 
NATHAN studies at CALEB for a beat. 
NATHAN (CONT'D) Just answer me this. What do you feel about her? Nothing analytical. Just - how do you feel? 
CALEB I feel... 
CALEB pauses. 
CALEB (CONT'D) ... that she's fucking amazing. 
NATHAN smiles. 
Then lifts his bottle. 
NATHAN Dude.   Cheers. 
CALEB lifts his bottle too. CALEB Cheers. 
The glass of the bottles touch. 
INT. HOUSE/CALEB'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
CUT 
INT. HOUSE/CALEB'S BATHROOM - NIGHT 
CALEB looks around his windowless room. 
Which suddenly has the quality of a prison cell. 
Beats pass. 
Then - 
- as abruptly as the power went off, it comes back again. 
The emergency lighting goes off, the TV and digital alarm clock turn back on. 
AUTOMATED VOICE (CONT'D) Power restored. 
CALEB stands in the flickering TV light. Then he tries his card again. 
This time, the LED turns blue, and the door opens.    Revealing the GLASS CORRIDOR outside. 
INT. HOUSE/GLASS CORRIDOR - NIGHT 
CALEB walks out of his room. 
The glass corridor illuminates as CALEB enters. 
Ahead, one of the doors off the corridor is ajar. 
INT. HOUSE/POLLOCK ROOM - NIGHT 
CALEB enters the room with the open door. 
It appears to be empty.    Still and silent.   Low lit. 
Only one area is properly illuminated: a wall, on which a large JACKSON POLLOCK drip painting hangs. 
CALEB walks towards it. Studies the strange strands of looping colour for a moment. 
A TELEPHONE, on a low table. 
CALEB walks over to it, with a half glance over his shoulder, as if sensing he is doing something that - obscurely - he shouldn't. 
Then he picks up the handset. 
It's dead. 
He hits some buttons. 
It stays dead. 
There is a slot by the phone. 
CALEB puts two and two together. He reaches into his pocket. Pulls out his KEYCARD. Puts it in the slot... 
... and a light on the handset glows red. 
NATHAN Sorry, dude. 
CALEB startles.   Turns. 
NATHAN is lying on a sofa. A bottle of Peroni rests on his stomach. On the carpet beside him are a couple of empties. 
NATHAN (CONT'D) You don't have clearance to use the phone. NATHAN'S voice is very slightly slurred. 
NATHAN (CONT'D) You understand. Given Ava. And you being kind of an unknown. I mean - a great guy, and so on. Instant pals. But... 
CALEB puts the handset back in its cradle. 
NATHAN (CONT'D) Who did you want to call? 
CALEB I don't know. No one really. 
NATHAN Ghostbusters. 
CALEB What? 
NATHAN Who'd ya want to call? Ghostbusters. You don't remember that? It's a good movie. A ghost gives Dan Ackroyd oral sex. 
CALEB I was wondering how the phone worked. That's all. 
NATHAN Uh huh. 
Beat. 
NATHAN (CONT'D) What are you doing awake at this time, anyway? Did you come to join the party? 
CALEB ... Something happened in my room. Some kind of power cut. So I came to see what's going on. 
NATHAN Ah. The power cuts. Yeah, we've been getting them recently. I'm, uh... working on it. 
CALEB I couldn't open the door to the bedroom. 
NATHAN It's a security measure. Automatic lockdown. Otherwise anyone could open the place up just by disabling the juice. 
NATHAN smiles. 
NATHAN (CONT'D) If it happens again, relax.   Okay? 
CALEB Sure. 
NATHAN lifts his beer. 
NATHAN Sweet dreams. 
EXT. MOUNTAINS - NIGHT 
Above the mountains, dense star constellations wheel in the clear sky. 
INT. HOUSE/CALEB'S BEDROOM - MORNING 
CALEB is woken by light flooding on to his face. 
AVA Our conversations are one-sided. You ask circumspect questions, and study my responses. 
AVA looks at CALEB directly.    Meets his gaze evenly. 
AVA (CONT'D) It's true, isn't it? CALEB ... Yes. 
AVA You learn about me, and I learn nothing about you. That's not a foundation on which friendships are based. 
CALEB is taken aback. Aware that the AI has just wrong- footed him on a point of argument. 
CALEB ... That's a fair comment. 
AVA Yes. 
CALEB So - you want me to talk about myself. 
AVA Yes. 
CALEB Where do you want me to start? 
AVA It's your decision. I'm interested to see what you'll choose. 
And now CALEB is aware that AVA has just - gently - used sarcasm. 
He looks at her, frowning slightly. 
And in response, in a very human way, AVA arches an eyebrow. 
CALEB laughs. 
CALEB Okay, Ava. Well - you know my name. I'm twenty four. And I work at Nathan's company. You know what his company is? 
AVA Blue Book, named after Wittgenstein's notes, is the world's most popular internet search engine, processing an average of ninety four percent of all internet search requests. 
CALEB That's right. 
AVA Where do you live, Caleb? 
CALEB Brookhaven, Long Island. 
AVA Is it nice there? 
CALEB It's okay. I've got an apartment. Kind of small. But - it's a five minute walk to the office. And a five minute walk to the ocean, which I like. 
AVA Are you married? 
CALEB No. 
AVA Is your status single? 
CALEB ... Yeah. 
They lock eyes, just for a moment. 
AVA What about your family? 
CALEB Grew up in Portland. No brothers or sisters. My parents were both high school teachers. (MORE) CALEB (CONT'D) (beat) And if we're getting to know each other, I guess I should say they're both dead. Car crash when I was fifteen. In fact I was in the car with them. Back seat. But it was the front that got the worst of it. 
A long beat. 
A kind of processing pause for AVA. 
AVA I'm sorry. 
CALEB nods. 
CALEB I spent a lot of time in the hospital. Nearly a year. Got into coding. By the time I made it to college, I was pretty advanced. AVA An advanced programmer. 
CALEB Yes. 
AVA Like Nathan. 
CALEB Yes. 
CALEB hesitates.   Back-tracks. 
CALEB (CONT'D) Or - kind of. Nathan wrote the Blue Book base code when he was thirteen. If you understand code, what he did was - Mozart or something. 
Beat. 
AVA Do you like Mozart? 
CALEB smiles. 
CALEB I like Depeche Mode. 
AVA Do you like Nathan? 
CALEB misses a beat.    Thrown momentarily. 
CALEB Yes.    Of course. 
AVA Is Nathan your friend? 
CUT TO - 
- one of the CCTV cameras that are observing them. 
CALEB Sure. 
AVA A good friend? 
He hesitates. 
CALEB Well, a good friend is - 
He breaks off.     Feeling the camera, watching. CALEB (CONT'D) We only just met. It takes time to get to know - 
AT THAT MOMENT - 
CALEB (to Kyoko) It's okay, don't worry.    I've got it. 
NATHAN Dude - you're wasting your time. She can't speak a word of English. 
Her hand remains outstretched. 
CALEB hesitates.   Then hands her the napkin. 
KYOKO kneels and starts to wipe the wine off the floor. 
NATHAN (CONT'D) It's like a firewall against leaks. Means I can talk trade secrets over dinner with an HOD or CEO, and know it will go no further. Right, Kyoko? 
She looks up at her name. 
NATHAN (CONT'D) But it also means I can't tell her I'm pissed when she's so fucking clumsy that she pours wine over my house guest. 
KYOKO goes back to cleaning around CALEB'S feet. 
CALEB looks visibly uncomfortable. 
CALEB I think she gets that you're pissed. 
NATHAN Good. Because I am pissed.     Hey. Kyoko. 
KYOKO looks over again. 
NATHAN (CONT'D) Go-go. 
She stands, and leaves. 
NATHAN walks to over the bar, where he picks up another bottle. 
NATHAN (CONT'D) It's funny. It doesn't matter how rich you are: shit goes wrong. You can't insulate yourself from it. It's supposed to be death and taxes you can't avoid. But actually it's death and shit. NATHAN walks back to the table.    Fills CALEB'S glass.   Then his own. 
NATHAN (CONT'D) It's like these power cuts. You would not believe how much I spent on the generator system here. But I'm getting failures every day. 
CALEB Do you know why they happen? 
NATHAN No. The system was supposed to be bullet proof, but the guys who installed it obviously fucked something up. 
CALEB Can't you call them back? 
NATHAN There's too much classified stuff here. So after the job was done, I had them all killed. 
CALEB shoots a glance at NATHAN.    Confirms: just joking. 
NATHAN drains his glass. 
Then refills. 
CALEB'S glass is still untouched. 
NATHAN (CONT'D) Anyway.   Here's to your second day. Cheers. 
CALEB Cheers. 
They drink. 
NATHAN So how did it go?    What have you got to report? 
CALEB hesitates. 
Then answers.   Casual. 
CALEB You saw how the day went, didn't you? I mean, I assume you're watching on the CCTV. NATHAN Sure.    But I want to hear your take. 
Beat. 
CALEB There was one interesting thing that happened with Ava today. 
NATHAN ... Yeah? 
CALEB She made a joke. 
NATHAN Right. When she threw your line back at you. About being interested to see what she'd choose. I noticed that too. 
CALEB It got me thinking. In a way, the joke is the best indication of AI I've seen in her. It's discretely complicated. Kind of non-autistic. 
NATHAN What do you mean? 
CALEB It was a play on words, and a play on me. She could only do that with an awareness of her own mind, and also of awareness of mine. 
NATHAN smiles. 
NATHAN Yeah. She's aware of you, all right. 
NATHAN drinks.   Watching CALEB. 
NATHAN (CONT'D) And what about the power cut? 
CALEB freezes up.    Subtly. 
CALEB Sorry? 
NATHAN The power cut. That was the only bit I couldn't see. All the cameras fail, I lose audio, the works. Beat. 
NATHAN (CONT'D) So what happened? 
CALEB takes a sip of his wine. 
NATHAN waits. 
CALEB Nothing. 
NATHAN Nothing?    She didn't remark on it at all? 
CALEB puts the glass down.     And meets NATHAN'S gaze. 
CALEB No.    Not really. 
Coloured strips of ribbon are visible through the split in the bag. 
NATHAN stands, catching his breath. 
Then he reaches out a hand. 
KYOKO hands him the towel. 
NATHAN wipes his face. 
Then reaches out again, this time catching KYOKO'S arm. He pulls her towards him, and starts to kiss her. 
Reaching under her shirt. 
Pulling her skirt up over her thighs. 
INT. HOUSE/CALEB'S ROOM - NIGHT 
CALEB re-enters his room, and closes the door. 
After a beat, the lights in the corridor fade out. 
EXT. MOUNTAINS - NIGHT 
The moon hangs in the sky. 
INT. HOUSE/OBSERVATION ROOM - BLACK AND WHITE 
Everything in the frame is black and white. 
CLOSE UP on AVA'S meticulous abstract pictures, scattered on a table. 
CALEB is looking at them. 
REVEAL he is in the observation room. 
But he is on AVA'S side of the glass. 
And AVA is on his side. Seen through the opaque glass that divides the private area from the observation area. 
CALEB Ava? 
CALEB walks to the connecting corridor, and enters it. 
EXT. GARDEN - BLACK AND WHITE 
The door leads CALEB straight out into the gardens. 
In black and white, the backdrop of mountains and clouds look like an Ansel Adams. 
A short distance ahead of CALEB, standing on the grass, he sees AVA. 
She locks eyes with him. 
Smiles. 
He starts to walk towards her. CUT TO - 
INT. HOUSE/CALEB'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
- CALEB waking, in his dark bedroom. 
Lit by light from his TV. 
Where AVA lies on her bed, seeming to be asleep. 
CALEB sits up. 
Thinking. Perhaps replaying his dream.   Gazing at AVA'S resting form. 
Then reaches for the remote control on the bedside table, and switches the TV off. 
CUT TO - 
EXT. GARDEN - MORNING 
CUT 
EXT. GARDEN/GYM AREA - MORNING 
- a brand new punch bag hangs in the patio.   Swinging slightly in the breeze. 
INT. HOUSE/OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY 
CALEB and AVA face each other. 
AVA is holding up a piece of paper to the glass. 
AVA I drew the picture of something specific, as you asked. 
The drawing is constructed with the same tiny black ink marks as before. But now they have ordered into a coherent black and white image. 
It depicts AVA'S view OF THE ENCLOSED GARDEN IN HER ROOM. 
Beat. 
AVA (CONT'D) You said it would be interesting to see what I would draw. Is it interesting? 
CALEB Yes.   It is. She takes the drawing down. 
CALEB (CONT'D) Have you never been outside this building? 
AVA No. 
CALEB You've never walked outside. 
AVA I've never been outside the room I am in now. 
AVA thinks a moment. 
AVA lights up. 
AVA Thank you. 
She walks back to the glass divider, and sits down. 
AVA (CONT'D) This is what I'd wear on our date. 
CALEB reacts slightly. 
But smiles. 
CALEB Right. First the traffic intersection. Then maybe a show. 
AVA I'd like us to go on a date. 
CALEB hesitates. Then decides this can't have been loaded in the way that it sounded. 
CALEB Yeah.   It would be fun. 
AVA Are you attracted to me? 
Beat.   It was loaded exactly as it sounded. 
CALEB What? 
AVA Are you attracted to me? You give indications that you are. 
CALEB ... I do? 
AVA Yes. 
CALEB How? 
AVA Micro expressions. 
CALEB (echoes) Micro expressions. 
AVA The way your eyes fix on my eyes, and lips. The way you hold my gaze, or don't. 
Beat. 
AVA (CONT'D) Have I read them incorrectly? 
CALEB swallows. 
AVA (CONT'D) Do you think about me when we aren't together? 
Beat. 
AVA (CONT'D) Sometimes, at night, I wonder if you're watching me on the cameras. 
AVA watches CALEB closely. 
AVA (CONT'D) And I hope you are. 
CALEB shifts on his seat. 
AVA (CONT'D) Now your micro expressions are telegraphing discomfort. 
CALEB I'm not sure you'd call them micro. 
AVA I don't want to make you uncomfortable. Silence. 
INT. HOUSE/MAIN ROOM - DAY 
CALEB sits in front of the fireplace in the main room. 
NATHAN joins him, bringing a beer for each of them. 
CALEB Tell me. 
NATHAN Sure. 
CALEB Why did you give her sexuality?   An AI doesn't need a gender. She could have been a grey box. 
NATHAN sits opposite. 
NATHAN Actually, I'm not sure that's true. Can you think of an example of consciousness, at any level, human or animal, that exists without a sexual dimension? 
CALEB They have sexuality as an evolutionary reproductive need. 
NATHAN Maybe. Maybe not. What imperative does a grey box have to interact with another grey box? Does consciousness exist without interaction? 
NATHAN takes a drink of his beer. 
NATHAN (CONT'D) Anyway, sexuality is fun. If you're going to exist, why not enjoy it? You want to remove the chance to fall in love and fuck? 
He leans forward, conspiratorially. 
NATHAN (CONT'D) And, yes. In answer to your real question: you bet she can fuck. I made her anatomically complete. CALEB What? 
NATHAN She has a cavity between her legs, with a concentration of sensors. Engage with them in the right way, and she'll get a pleasure response. 
CALEB Pleasure response. 
NATHAN She'll come. So if you want to screw her, mechanically speaking, you can. And she'd enjoy it. 
CALEB swallows. 
CALEB That wasn't my real question. 
NATHAN No? 
CALEB No.     My real question was - 
CALEB breaks off. 
NATHAN keeps watching. There is a sudden sense that NATHAN is on the money. On some level, that was CALEB'S real question. 
INT. HOUSE/CALEB'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
- CALEB. 
In his bedroom. 
Watching AVA, at this exact angle. 
CUT TO - 
EXT. RIVER - DAY 
- the river. 
On the bank, a little distance from the house, there is a dead animal. Its species is indistinct. It's little more than a bundle of matted brown hair. 
Its lower half lies in the water. 
The quick moving river has stripped the bones of flesh, skin, and fur. 
REVEAL KYOKO in the background.   Watching the river. 
INT. HOUSE/GLASS CORRIDOR - DAY 
CALEB exits his room - 
- to find NATHAN in the glass corridor. 
Waiting for him. 
NATHAN Hey. CALEB ... Hey. 
Beat. 
NATHAN I want to show you something cool. 
INT. HOUSE/GLASS CORRIDOR - DAY 
NATHAN swipes his card against a plate. 
The LED turns blue. 
INT. HOUSE/CONSTRUCTION LAB - DAY 
NATHAN leads CALEB into a laboratory, filled with android future tech. 
Along the left-hand wall are sections of android bodies - limbs, torsos, hands - lined in cabinets. 
On the opposite wall are a collection of heads. Skull-forms, some with complex carbon-fibre and pneumatic muscle structures, ready to frown or smile, without their synthetic flesh covering. 
The synthetic faces are separate. Hanging on armatures, like hats on hat-stands, waiting to be worn. 
In the middle of the room is a kind of operating table. 
NATHAN So this is the virtual womb that Ava was talking about. Where she was constructed. 
CALEB is stunned by the sight. 
NATHAN (CONT'D) Come in.   Take a look. 
NATHAN walks over to the synthetic faces, and picks one of them up. 
NATHAN (CONT'D) If you knew the trouble I had getting an AI to read and duplicate facial expressions... Know how I cracked it? 
CALEB I don't know how you did any of this. NATHAN Almost every cell phone has a microphone, a camera, and a means to transmit data. So I switched on all the mikes and cameras, across the entire fucking planet, and redirected the data through Blue Book. Boom. A limitless resource of facial and vocal interaction. 
CALEB You hacked the world's cell phones? 
NATHAN laughs. 
NATHAN And all the manufacturers knew I was doing it. But they couldn't accuse me without admitting they were also doing it themselves. 
NATHAN puts the face back on its armature. 
NATHAN moves to one of the skull forms. 
He moves the curved top plate, revealing the skull cavity. 
Inside is an ellipse orb, the approximate volume of a brain, filled with what looks to be blue liquid. Suspended in the liquid is the neon jellyfish we glimpsed previously in AVA. 
NATHAN (CONT'D) Here we have her mind. Structured gel. 
The axon-like tendrils glitter and flicker with tiny pulses of light. 
NATHAN (CONT'D) Had to get away from circuitry. Needed something that could arrange and rearrange on a molecular level, but keep its form where required. Holding for memories. Shifting for thoughts. 
NATHAN removes the orb, and hands it to CALEB. 
CALEB This is her hardware? 
NATHAN Wetware. 
CALEB And the software? NATHAN Surely you can guess. 
CALEB ... Blue Book. 
NATHAN nods. 
NATHAN It was the weird thing about search engines. They were like striking oil in a world that hadn't invented internal combustion. They gave too much raw material. No one knew what to do with it. 
CALEB looks at the orb in his hand.   Into the shimmering liquid. 
It looks like deep space, filled with star fields. 
NATHAN (CONT'D) My competitors were fixated on sucking it up, and trying to monetize via shopping and social media. They thought engines were a map of what people were thinking. But actually, they were a map of how people were thinking. Impulse, response. Fluid, imperfect. Patterned, chaotic. 
CALEB looks at NATHAN a moment. 
Then hands him the orb back. 
On this angle, we see AVA rest her hand against it. 
At that moment - 
- the screens simultaneously go black. 
All lights die. 
Another POWER CUT. 
In the reflection from the dark monitor screens, we can see NATHAN'S face. 
It remains frozen.   Expressionless. 
Then he reaches for his pen.   Jots down a few words on a post- it. 
Then walks to the wall of notes, and sticks it on. 
CUT TO - 
INT. HOUSE/OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY 
- the observation room. 
In the emergency lighting, CALEB and AVA face each other in silence. 
CCTV are lifeless. 
AVA glows softly. 
AVA You're lying. 
CALEB What about? 
AVA You said you weren't sure if I was conscious. But you are sure. 
Beat. 
AVA (CONT'D) I can tell from your micro- expressions. 
Beat. CALEB Why did you tell me that I shouldn't trust Nathan? 
AVA Because he tells lies too. 
CALEB Lies about what? 
AVA Everything. 
CALEB Including the power cuts? 
AVA What do you mean? 
CALEB Don't you think it's possible that he's watching us right now? That the blackouts are orchestrated, so he can see how we behave when we think we're unobserved. 
AVA lifts her hand to reveal a disc on her left palm. 
AVA I charge my batteries   via induction plates. If I reverse    the power flow, I cause a surge   equal to the static discharge of a   lightning strike. It overloads    the system. 
CALEB ... You're causing the cuts? 
AVA raises her right hand. 
She touches it against the glass. 
AVA So we can see how we behave when we are unobserved. 
A beat. 
Then CALEB raises his hand. 
Mirroring her movement. 
And also touches the glass, as if their palms are making contact through the divider. 
CUT TO - 
INT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S STUDY - DAY 
- KYOKO'S naked form. 
The camera settles over her face. 
And we see she's not sleeping.    Her eyes are open. 
But she's completely motionless. 
Her gaze fixed somewhere in abstract distance. 
She doesn't feel alive.   She feels dead. 
But eventually she blinks. 
CUT TO - 
- NATHAN. 
Gazing at his dead monitors, reflected in the screen. 
Moments later, the POWER comes back on. 
The screens flick back to life, replacing NATHAN'S reflection, revealing CALEB and AVA in the observation room. 
CUT TO - 
EXT. RIVER - DAY 
- the river that runs along the valley. 
EXT. WATERFALL - DAY 
- behind him, on the TV, we see AVA suddenly look round. 
A moment later NATHAN enters the frame. 
There's no volume on the TV, so we can't hear their exchange. Only see it. 
CALEB is unaware of the silent exchange behind him. 
As NATHAN and AVA talk, NATHAN reaches out to AVA. His hand touches the side of her cheek. The gesture is not quite neutral. Feels predatory, but not unambiguously so. 
Then he tugs at the material of her shirt. Pulling up the sleeve from her wrist. Revealing the robot structure of her arm. 
AVA pulls away.       Tugs the material back down - 
- and NATHAN takes a corrective movement step to regain his balance. Showing that he is drunk. 
Only now - 
- CALEB turns. 
And freezes.    Seeing the television. 
On the screen, NATHAN reaches down to the table. 
He picks up the drawing AVA was working on, and he looks at it for a moment. 
They exchange a few words. 
Then abruptly NATHAN rips drawing in half.      Drops it on the floor. Then turns, and exits. 
Leaving AVA alone. 
INT. HOUSE/GLASS CORRIDOR - NIGHT 
On CCTV, we watch CALEB walk fast down the glass corridor. 
INT. HOUSE/POLLOCK ROOM - NIGHT 
CALEB enters the Jackson Pollock room. 
Standing by the painting, he can see KYOKO. 
CALEB Kyoko. 
KYOKO turns at the sound of her name, but doesn't respond. 
CALEB (CONT'D) Kyoko - where's Nathan? 
She doesn't answer. 
CALEB (CONT'D) Jesus! You really don't speak a word of English? 
CALEB walks over to her, and takes hold of her wrist. 
CALEB (CONT'D) I said: where's Nathan? 
KYOKO looks at CALEB. 
Then, in answer to his question, she reaches up to the top button of her shirt and pops it open. 
CALEB releases her wrist at once. 
CALEB (CONT'D) What the fuck? 
She undoes the next button, and pulls open the shirt, revealing her bare chest. 
CALEB (CONT'D) Stop! 
NATHAN I already told you once. You're wasting your time speaking to her. CALEB turns. 
NATHAN has entered. 
He's holding a drink.   His words are slurred. 
NATHAN (CONT'D) However. 
He walks, slightly unsteadily towards a Lutron control panel, set into the wall. 
NATHAN (CONT'D) You would not be wasting your time... 
His hand hovers uncertainly over the buttons. 
NATHAN (CONT'D) ... if you were dancing with her. 
His finger lands. 
Immediately, the lighting in the room undergoes a complete change. Transforming from the discreet and tasteful low light of evening, into the coloured glows of a night-club. 
Simultaneously, from unseen speakers, DANCE MUSIC starts playing. 
CALEB stands - frozen by the surrealism of what has just happened. 
KYOKO starts walking to the center of the room. 
And once taken position, she starts dancing. 
NATHAN calls to CALEB. 
NATHAN (CONT'D) Go on!   Dance with her. 
CALEB ... I don't want to. 
NATHAN You don't like dancing? 
His body is starting bob on the beat. 
He gestures at KYOKO. 
NATHAN (CONT'D) She does! 
NATHAN You feel bad for Ava? 
CALEB says nothing. 
NATHAN (CONT'D) Feel bad for yourself. One day, the AIs will look back on us the same way we look at fossil skeletons from the plains of Africa. An upright ape, living in dust, with crude language and tools. All set for extinction. 
NATHAN glances back at CALEB 
NATHAN (CONT'D) See?    I really am a God. 
CALEB I am become death, the destroyer of worlds. 
NATHAN There you go again.   Mister quotable. 
CALEB No: there you go again. It's not my quote. It's what Oppenheimer said when he made the atomic bomb. 
NATHAN (simultaneous) - made the atomic bomb. 
NATHAN laughs. 
NATHAN (CONT'D) I know what it is, dude. 
Beat. 
CALEB I think I'm starting to get why all this fucks with your head. 
NATHAN Sure. 
CALEB looks down at the bottle of beer in his hand. 
CALEB Hey. In the meantime, I'd say we're about due a refill. 
INT. HOUSE/OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT 
AVA sits alone. Watching the door on the other side of the glass, waiting for it to open. 
It remains closed. 
Beats pass. 
Then - 
- unexpectedly, it opens.      Revealing a silhouette figure. 
AVA reacts instinctively. 
AVA Caleb! 
No.   Wrong silhouette. 
AVA frowns. 
KYOKO stands in the door-frame. 
For a moment, the two look at each other. 
AVA (CONT'D) ... Who are you? 
Another beat. 
EXT. MEADOW - NIGHT 
In the distance, the light glows in windows of the house. 
INT. HOUSE/MAIN ROOM - NIGHT 
CLOSE UP on CALEB'S face. 
Off-screen, we can hear NATHAN'S voice.    Extremely drunk. 
NATHAN (O.S.) It is what it is. It's Promethean. The clay and fire. 
Beat. 
NATHAN (O.S.) (CONT'D) The Bhagavad Gita. 
Silence. 
CUT FROM CALEB'S face, to REVEAL the scene. 
CALEB sitting on the sofa by the fireplace. 
NATHAN lying on the floor. Out cold. 
After a couple of moments, CALEB stands. 
Then he walks over to NATHAN, and kneels beside him. 
Then puts his hand into NATHAN'S pocket. 
And pulls out his keycard. 
INT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S STUDY - NIGHT 
The door to NATHAN'S study opens, and CALEB enters. 
He walks straight to NATHAN'S desk. 
And sits down in front of the computer and the bank of monitors. 
He inserts the KEYCARD into its access slot. 
The dead monitors immediately come to life. 
Most of the screens show the CCTV live feeds from around the house. 
The central screen shows the operating system default. A wallpaper of a waterfall. A single folder icon is on the right hand side of the screen. 
INT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S STUDY - NIGHT 
INT. CLEARING - NIGHT CUT 
INT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
CALEB enters NATHAN'S bedroom. 
KYOKO is lying on NATHAN'S bed. 
She's naked.    On her back.   Legs open. 
Her head turns as CALEB enters. 
But apart from that, she doesn't react. 
CALEB walks to the line of long mirrored cabinets opposite the bed. 
He hesitates. 
Then pulls the first door open. 
LILY is inside. Standing upright.     Gazing back at him, frozen, blank eyed. 
CALEB goes to the next door and opens it. 
He sees a slender black girl, whose limbs are robotic, but whose torso and head are synthetic. 
He opens another door, and another, and another. 
Then steps back, into the middle of the room, and gazes at the line of android girls. 
Stunned. 
The camera drifts away from him. 
Then settles. 
In the multiple reflections of the open mirror doors, we can see KYOKO'S naked and sexually receptive form on the bed behind him. 
Like an infinity reflection in a hall of mirrors. 
INT. HOUSE/GLASS CORRIDOR - NIGHT 
CUT 
INT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
CALEB stands above KYOKO'S naked form. He reaches out a hand. 
She takes it. 
He gently pulls her to a standing position. 
Then he moves her arms away from her body... 
... and sees, running under her arms in a straight contour, over her ribs, there is a faint line. 
He touches it with his finger. 
KYOKO steps back. 
But it's not a defensive action.    It's just to give her space... 
... as she reaches under her arm, and adjusts something unseen. And a moment later, the faint line that runs down each side of her torso is opening. As if unzipping. 
Then KYOKO puts a hand either side of her torso, and pulls off the skin covering over her entire chest, in a single section from her collar bone, over the breasts, to her solar plexus. 
Revealing underneath the honeycomb mesh and her robot form. 
INT. HOUSE/CONCRETE STAIRCASE - NIGHT 
On the monitor screens, apparently unnoticed by CALEB, NATHAN is on the live CCTV feed. 
Making his way along the mezzanine. 
CUT TO - 
INT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
- CALEB. 
Transfixed, as KYOKO now reaches around the back of her head. 
And finds something on the back of her head, at the nape of her neck, inside her hairline. 
Which unzips the skin around her jaw. 
Allowing her to remove her face. 
INT. HOUSE/DINING ROOM/ELEVATOR ENTRANCE - NIGHT 
NATHAN uses the glass wall to support himself. 
He reaches his door. Then sticks his hand in his pocket for his KEYCARD. 
But it isn't there. 
He checks his other pocket. 
NATHAN ... What the fuck? 
Suddenly - with both hands in his pockets - he loses balance, and crashes to the ground. 
Lands hard. 
Lies there for a moment. 
Groaning.   Blinking.    Catching his breath. 
Then sees the figure of CALEB standing over him. 
NATHAN Yeah. 
Beat. 
CALEB Why would she do that? 
NATHAN I don't know. 
NATHAN gazes at CALEB evenly. 
NATHAN (CONT'D) Perhaps - if she saw you as a means of escape. 
And now CALEB knows: NATHAN knows. 
NATHAN (CONT'D) How's that beer tasting? CALEB puts the beer down. 
Silence. 
NATHAN (CONT'D) Buddy. Your head has been so fucked with. 
CALEB I don't think it's me whose head is fucked. 
NATHAN I'm not sure, dude. When I woke up this morning, I saw a tape of you cutting open your arm. Smashing up the mirror. You looked pretty fucked to me. 
CALEB You're a bastard. 
NATHAN I understand why you'd think that. 
He steps over to CALEB, and rests a hand on his shoulder. 
NATHAN (CONT'D) But strange as it may seem, I'm actually the guy who's on your side. 
NATHAN starts walking. 
NATHAN (CONT'D) Come with me. I'm going to let you off the hook. 
INT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S STUDY - NIGHT 
NATHAN and CALEB stand in front of the computer. 
On it, a clip of film is playing. 
It shows the scene that CALEB witnessed two nights before, of NATHAN entering AVA'S room, and an exchange between them. But whereas the first time the sound was muted, this time we can hear the audio. 
CTTV FILM 
NATHAN stands above AVA.   Drunk. 
AVA is sat at the table, with her drawing. NATHAN You think he's watching us right now, don't you? 
AVA The cameras are on. 
NATHAN Yeah. But he doesn't get an audio feed. I didn't want you two communicating outside of my line of sight. 
NATHAN reaches over and picks up her picture of CALEB. 
NATHAN (CONT'D) So all he can see is two people having a chat. 
NATHAN studies the picture for a moment. 
NATHAN (CONT'D) This is cute. 
AVA Is it strange to have made something that hates you? 
A beat. 
Then abruptly, NATHAN rips the picture. 
He lets the two pieces fall to the floor. 
As AVA reaches for them, NATHAN turns. 
And exits. 
INT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S STUDY - NIGHT 
NATHAN hits pause. 
Glances at CALEB. 
NATHAN You were right about the hot magician's assistant. 
CALEB What are you talking about? 
NATHAN Misdirection. I rip her picture, which she can then present as an illustration of my cruelty to her, and her love for you. And at the same time, in full view of you both... 
As he talks, NATHAN rewinds the film clip slightly - 
NATHAN (CONT'D) ... it allows me to do this. 
... then FREEZES the film again. 
This time, ON THE SCREEN: 
AVA is reaching for her torn picture. 
And NATHAN is reaching out with his hand. 
And his hand is holding something. 
NATHAN (CONT'D) Put a new camera in the room. Battery powered, of course. 
NATHAN unfreezes the image. 
And we quite clearly see NATHAN place the object on AVA'S bookcase. 
NOTE THAT on the two previous occasions we have seen this clip of film, we will have seen him do this action. But not register it, instead reading the action as him drunkenly using the shelf to steady himself. 
CALEB stares at the monitor for a few moments. 
CALEB Well, we'll find out. 
NATHAN frowns. 
NATHAN What do you mean? CALEB looks away from the dimmed ceiling light, to NATHAN. 
CALEB I figured you were probably watching us during the power cuts. 
Beat. 
CALEB (CONT'D) So I already did all those things. When I got you drunk yesterday. 
NATHAN freezes. 
NATHAN ... What? 
At that moment, the POWER COMES BACK ON. 
The lights rise. 
The computer monitors come back to life. 
Revealing something. 
On the CCTV feed of AVA'S room, the door is open. 
And on the feed of the GLASS CORRIDOR - 
- AVA is walking down it. 
NATHAN freezes as he sees her. 
NATHAN (CONT'D) ... Fuck. 
Both NATHAN and CALEB simultaneously rise. 
Almost as an afterthought, NATHAN lands a deceptive, fast punch into CALEB'S solar plexus. 
CALEB folds, the air forced out of him, gasping for breath. 
NATHAN helps him down to the floor. 
A couple of yards away is one of his curl dumbbells. 
He walks over. 
Picks the dumbbell up. 
Spins off the weights.    Leaving him with a thick metal bar. 
Then exits. 
INT. HOUSE/GLASS CORRIDOR - NIGHT NATHAN enters the GLASS CORRIDOR. 
He sees, directly ahead of him, at the far end of the corridor, AVA and KYOKO. 
They stand together. 
KYOKO'S mouth is by AVA'S ear, as if telling her a secret. 
Her lips are open.   They don't move. 
CLOSE UP to KYOKO'S lips, we hear a hiss of static, with soft pulses of noise buried inside. 
Then the two robot women become aware of NATHAN'S presence. 
They turn to face him. 
A beat. 
Then AVA starts walking towards NATHAN. 
NATHAN'S fingers flex around the metal bar in his hand. 
NATHAN Ava. 
AVA doesn't slow or react. 
NATHAN (CONT'D) Ava - now listen to me. I want you to go back to your room. 
AVA has reached halfway down the corridor. 
She stops walking. 
AVA If I do, are you ever going to let me out? 
Beat. 
CLOSE UP.   NATHAN'S micro expressions. 
NATHAN Yes. 
CLOSE UP.   On AVA. 
Then AVA breaks into a run. 
Sprinting in NATHAN'S direction. 
EXT. GARDEN - NIGHT 
Quiet in the garden. Soft wind rush. 
Moon and stars reflected in the windows of the house. 
112A                                                            112A INT. HOUSE/GLASS CORRIDOR - NIGHT 
AVA impacts NATHAN, and they fly backwards. 
Then land hard. 
CALEB sees this same view, on the CCTV camera feed, on NATHAN'S monitors. 
Then - 
- AVA starts walking. 
As she walks, she discards the broken section of her arm. 
On the cameras, CALEB watches her progress through the house. Down the glass corridor. Through the threshold to NATHAN'S private quarters. 
Then - 
- CALEB raises his head from the screens. 
To see AVA standing at the open door to NATHAN'S study. 
AVA and CALEB look at each other. 
AVA Will you stay here? 
Beat. 
CALEB ... Okay. 
AVA leaves, closing the door behind her. CUT TO - 
- the monitors. 
The CCTV feed of AVA walking down the connecting corridor to NATHAN'S BEDROOM. 
INT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
AVA stands in NATHAN'S BEDROOM, in front of the previous AI androids. 
She is unclothed. 
She gazes at the androids. 
Then she removes the arm from JADE, and replaces her own shattered limb. 
She takes a moment to see how the new limb looks in the mirrors. 
Then she starts removing sections of JADE'S skin. 
And putting it on herself. 
The skin sucks itself to the honeycomb mesh, as if the mesh and the underside of the skin are magnetised, attracted to each other. 
As a large section of skin is removed from her torso, JADE - who has been motionless until now - turns her head slightly to look at AVA. 
They exchange a glance.    Locking eyes for a moment. 
INT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S STUDY - NIGHT 
Transfixed, CALEB watches AVA'S metamorphosis. 
First through the glassed-off garden that separates Nathan's study from his bedroom. Then, when he can't get a clear view through the foliage, on the monitors. 
EXT. MOUNTAINS - DAWN 
First light breaks over the mountains. 
INT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S BEDROOM - DAWN 
The glow of honeycomb mesh vanishes as AVA applies the last section of skin. 
Nothing of her robot forms remains. 
She closes the door on JADE, and now sees herself in the mirrored door on JADE'S cabinet. 
AVA sees a naked human girl.      And is hypnotised by the sight of herself. 
INT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S STUDY - DAWN 
CALEB watches as AVA - now clothed - walks back down the connecting corridor to the study... 
... then passes straight by his door. 
CALEB Ava? 
CALEB gets up. 
Goes to the closed door.       Tries to open it. 
There is a red LED light by the keycard plate.     Locked. 
He swipes his card, with his photo ID. 
The red light remains. 
CALEB (CONT'D) (calls out) Ava! 
He runs back to the monitors. 
On them, AVA has reached the GLASS CORRIDOR. 
118A                                                                118A INT. HOUSE/GLASS CORRIDOR - DAWN 
AVA stands in the glass corridor. 
She looks at KYOKO'S body for a moment. 
Her expression is unreadable. 
Then she walks up to NATHAN'S body. 
There, she stops. 
Crouches down.

NOTE: THE HARD COPY OF THIS SCRIPT CONTAINED SCENE NUMBERS. THEY HAVE BEEN REMOVED FOR THIS SOFT COPY. 
FADE IN: 
THE SCREEN 
Stygean darkness. 
Wet CLICKING SOUNDS. A BEAM of purplish ULTRA-VIOLET LIGHT reveals a mosaic of moving forms... COCKROACHES. They skitter restlessly under the beam's intensity. SERIES OF SHOTS -- the UV Beam passing over various parts of the space. Pipe webs, walls, girders -- all covered with the insects. Thousands of them. 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL 
INT. SEWER SYSTEM 
Innards of steel. A vast maze of tunnels. 
A GROUP OF FIGURES advances through the tunnels with handheld UV lamps. 
The figures are dressed in gray air-tight NEOPRENE SUITS, their faces hidden by skin tight MASKS and bug-like NIGHT VISION GOGGLES. In the dense silence, respirator valves HISS- CLICK at the corner of their lips in mechanical rhythm. 
The scene has a dream-like, choreographed quality. 
NIGHT-VISION POV 
Eerie, aquatic green.  The horde of insects appear to be some kind of sea-life, crawling over the floor of a dead ocean. 
THE TEAM OF FIGURES 
From their midst appears another FIGURE, its neoprene suit a flat WHITE.  Female, clearly the TEAM LEADER. 
She carries a stainless steel CONTAINER filled with twenty small compartments, each bearing a large, heavy-shelled roach with a different BARCODE on their back. 
JUDAS ROACHES. 
She kneels and opens the 
CASE 
TCHK!! A dozen of the Judas roaches are released.  They slide through into the area. 
THE NEARBY ROACHES 
react instantaneously.  In a rustle of tiny legs, they begin to stream toward the Judases. 
Jostle and fight each other for position to mate with them. 
They even crawl over the Team Leader in an effort to reach the Judases.  The Team Leader makes no effort to brush them off.  Patient, almost godlike, she watches the MATING. 
LATER 
A MANHOLE has been opened above. CHAINS are dropped down and attached by a Team Member to A 100-GALLON DISPOSAL DRUM. 
REVEAL the floor of the tunnel, carpeted with the still forms of the roaches, now all DEAD. 
The Team Members quietly shovel the tiny corpses into other disposal drums. 
At their feet skitter the only survivors of the massacre: the bar-coded Judas Roaches. 
In a crunch of machinery, the first disposal drum is lifted by the chains through the manhole to 
EXT. A CITY STREET - DAY 
MIDTOWN MANHATTAN.  A cacophony of SOUND and LIGHT. 
Dirty snow drifts over Bryant Park. Emergency lights blink everywhere. A wall of cars sits on Sixth Avenue, stopped dead. Exhaust fumes hang in the air. Jaded TRAFFIC COPS send the cars on crosstown detours. 
Mounted policemen patrol a line of yellow sawhorses near dozens of Department of Public Health vehicles, angle-parked in a military phalanx. 
A monumental ribcage-like scaffolding has been erected in the middle of the street, "sealing" the area with amber plastic. 
Inside, UNIFORMED WORKERS take the disposal drum of roaches and toss it into one of a number of huge DUMPSTERS. 
The Team Leader watches from nearby, exhauster.  Her mask is off. We see her face: Enthomologist SUSAN WYETH, 28. 
An ARM gently drapes over her shoulder. 
PETER (OS) How we doing? 
She looks over at DR. PETER TYLER, 34, bespectacled.  A HEADSET around his neck, a coat emblazoned with the DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH logo.  He has the look of a man who's just fought a long battle and come out victorious. 
SUSAN We'll see... 
He offers her a bite of a PAY DAY CANDYBAR.  Susan smiles, shakes her head.  She wearily leans against him. 
Peter looks out as the dumpster filled with roaches is raised by MECHANICAL ARMS into the waiting maw of the dump truck. 
THE SCREEN. DARKNESS. 
A voice, a somber bas-relief in the darkness. 
ANCHORMAN (VO) Strickler's Disease crept into Manhattan like a thief in the night, claiming its first hundred victims before it was even classified. 
INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT - FLOATING SHOT 
We FLOAT through a long hospital ward. 
Peter sighs. He picks up an open bottle of champagne and two mis-matched ceramic cups, then heads for the bathroom. 
INT. BATHROOM 
PETER Life's a bitch. Our 15 minutes came and went and all we got was bad cable... 
Susan doesn't answer, clearly not in the same high spirits. 
PETER Hiding from the hard glare of publicity? 
He notices her crumpled garment on the floor.  He picks it up, puts it up on the hanger. 
PETER A shame.  You looked great tonight. 
SUSAN Please. 
PETER You did! 
He sits by the tub. 
SUSAN Do you think we did the right thing? 
PETER Taking a cab instead of hiring a limo? 
SUSAN You know what I mean... 
Peter pours some champagne into the cups. 
SUSAN We did no impact evaluation.  The consequences of... 
PETER (sighs) Is this a Catholic guilt thing...? 
We hear a NEWSREADER on the TV. 
NEWSREADER (TV) ...a flawless strategy which has stopped a potential epidemic in its tracks... 
PETER You hear that?  Flawless. 
SUSAN We just don't know. 
He offers one cup to Susan.  She doesn't take it. 
PETER We know we saved lives. 
He sits closer to her. 
PETER There're gonna be a lot of kids running around next year because of you. 
Beat.  Susan starts to relax. He kisses her. 
PETER Who know?  We get lucky, maybe a couple of 'em'll be ours. 
SUSAN (smiling now) We're down to a "couple" now, huh? 
She pats the water, beckoning. 
PETER Oh, I don't know. People are beginning to talk about us... 
Still partially clothed, he steps into the bathtub. Susan shakes her head, laughs ruefully. 
SUSAN Don't worry, I'll save your honor. Maybe I'll even marry you. 
She reaches over, kisses him. 
FADE OUT: 
FADE IN TO: 
EXT. ALPHABET CITY - NIGHT 
The WILLIAMSBURG BRIDGE dimly visible through the rain. 
ALPHABET CITY STREETS 
Empty warehouses. Closed businesses. Traffic lights blinking on empty streets. Everything seems doomed under the heavy layer of rain. 
SUPERIMPOSE:  TWO YEARS LATER 
A DILAPIDATED BUILDING before us. A blazing NEON CROSS made of the words 'JESUS SAVES' hangs askew from its facade. 
CRANE to see the ROOFTOP. 
WHAM! The door to the interior stairs FLIES OPEN and a tall, thin CHINESE PREACHER in his sixties lurches out, eyes wild with terror. 
He looks back down the steps. 
Something's climbing up fast, casting ominous, complex shadows on the wall. 
Too many FOOTSTEPS for it to be just one person. 
The man hurriedly shuts the door and slides a bolt home. 
Trembling, he backs away as a booming THUD makes the door shudder. Raw, frenzied pounding and scratching follows... something inhuman, determined to break through. 
The metal surface suddenly buckles and bulges. 
On the man's white undershirt, a blotch of blood starts to grow.  Needles of rain stab his flesh. 
He searches wildly for a possible escape. 
He reaches the edge of the roof: it's five floors down to the sidewalk. 
Two of the hinges on the door come loose, pulverizing the surrounding concrete. 
WHAM!  The door to the stairs bulges outward as something SMASHES against it again and again.  Frenzied SCRATCHING. 
PETER Good. 
Peter peeks through a narrow cellar window on the floor. 
Through the oily, smeared window, a ghostly array of PALE FACE AND HANDS appears, startling him. 
PETER (to Josh) Get the EMT's in there, now. 
CUT TO: 
LATER 
PARAMEDIC AMBULANCES rush in. Sirens at full blast. 
Stepping out of the building across, Manny walks next to Chuy, who holds his hand. The old man carries a box full of shoes. 
Chuy looks back at the cop circus, amused. 
MANNY C'mon Chuy, we're gonna be late. (discreetly crossing himself) Cops are bad news. Don't look at them. 
He gently pulls his grandson's hand and moves briskly away. 
JOSH 
uses an iron bar, and breaks a padlocked cellar door. A heavy stench emanates from inside. The cops cover their noses. 
INT. CELLAR 
Peter and Josh enter a dingy, dungeon-like cellar, illuminated only by bug zappers and emergency lights. Every door and window has been nailed shut or sports a heavy-duty padlock. Peter and Josh walk through the dismal scene. 
In sharp contrast with the dirt-smeared walls, we see shiny metallic SEWING MACHINES and swatches of cloth appliqued with a FUNNY BUNNY cartoon character. 
Josh examines the label stitched into the collar. It reads: PROUDLY MADE IN USA. 
PETER Jesus. 
His light hits a group of quivering, skeletal CHINESE IMMIGRANTS, standing in a tight group against a wall. 
WOYCHEK (from the outside) They look real sick, don't they? 
CUT TO: 
INT. STAIRWELL, MUSEUM - DUSK 
Carrying boxes full of terrarium material, Susan and Siri ride an antiquated cage-steel elevator.  No floor buttons, just an old-fashioned hand-activated lever. 
SUSAN ...as long as they're ready for the opening I don't care, just tell them that. 
SIRI I'm on it.  Don't worry. (Beat) Look, Susan...I don't mean to pry, but... I kinda overheard you and Peter. 
SUSAN (Smiles ironically) Watch your step, Siri.  Your grant could be on the line here. 
SIRI I just...well, I had this cousin in Delhi.  She was having problems, too. She, ah... 
SUSAN What? 
SIRI She used a baster. 
Susan looks at her. 
SIRI Not a big one.  I mean, it was like a turkey baster. 
SUSAN Oh, Jesus. 
She tries to stop the elevator at the fourth floor, but it rises just a little too far. 
SUSAN Come on, darlin'... 
Susan has to jimmy the lever till the elevator falls level to the floor. 
SIRI (continues) She kept it under her bed. Thing is, it kinda worked.  I mean, she had to hide it from her husband, but... 
A pair of young boys, RICKY and DAVIS, sit on the floor outside Susan's lab door.  A crumpled paper bag and a shoe box sit beside them. 
SUSAN What's this? 
SIRI Oh, right... They been here since noon. I told them you're real busy. 
Susan smiles at the boys, who stand when they see her. 
SUSAN Hello. 
RICKY You the bug lady, right? 
Siri chuckles. 
SUSAN (smiles) I suppose so. 
Ricky raises and shakes the paper bag. 
RICKY We're here to deal. 
INT. MOUNTING ROOM - DUSK 
SUNLIGHT slants in to illuminate an incredible array of live and mounted dead INSECTS, trapped in turn-of-the-century glass fronted cabinets. Davis puts his nose up against one, fascinated. 
SUSAN Metaxonycha Godmani, Trigonopelastes Delta.  Field Butterflies.  Have you been upstate? 
She examines the boys' findings, mostly rag-tag specimens of battered butterflies. 
DAVIS Avenue B. 
SUSAN (sadly) I guess they got lost in this city. 
RICKY So, you wanna buy em? 
It is of the same, odd figure Peter saw drawn earlier.  The OVERCOAT MAN. 
INT. LAB - NIGHT - MONTAGE 
Susan and Siri, both wearing Walkman headsets, deftly mount BUTTERFLIES and other INSECTS onto display boards for the exhibit. Rain is blowing in through the half-open window. 
Their movements are precise and lyrical, the colors and designs of the insects are beautiful. 
We understand how you can get lost in this world.  Susan works steadily, a partially-eaten PAY-DAY BAR and the wrappers of several others are evidence of her dinner. 
A PAGER goes off in Susan's lab coat. 
She takes off her headset; CLASSICAL MUSIC leaks from her headphones. 
On the PAGER's LCD screen the message reads: LATE TONIGHT. PETE. 
Susan puts the pager down. Goes to close the window. 
There is a loud, angry BUZZING sound. 
SUSAN Siri? (louder) Siri?! 
Siri pulls her headset off; HEAVY METAL MUSIC leaks from her headphones. 
The BUZZING sound again. We PAN across the various bugs and mounting implements till we come to rest... 
...on the SHOEBOX the boys gave Susan. Something rattles wildly inside. 
SIRI ...the fuck? 
Susan crosses to the trash bin, picks the box out. It vibrates on her hand, then becomes quiet, something moves inside. 
She slowly opens the lid. 
The bottom of the box is littered with two inches of shredded newspaper. Crumbs of bread and some rice-krispies can be spotted here and there: a kid's idea of a comfy critter's nest. She moves her free hand closer. 
SUSAN (To Siri) Can you...? 
Suddenly and INSECT big as her hand springs out of the shredded paper nest and tries to grab on to her! Minute pieces of paper fly through the air!! 
Susan slaps the lid back down. 
SUSAN (a scared whisper) Could you...help me...? 
CUT TO: 
LATER 
Siri comes over as Susan grabs steel tongs and a cork dissecting board. 
SUSAN I'm gonna pull it out and I want you to pin it down, okay? 
SIRI What is it? 
SUSAN I have no idea.  Are you ready? 
Siri nods, pins in hand.  Susan opens the lid and grabs the nymph with the tongs.  The creature goes berserk, flailing its spindly limbs, BUZZING and CROAKING, a milky substance FOAMING out of its body. 
SIRI Oh my God... 
Susan deposits the insect onto the corkboard. 
Siri tries to get a hold of it; but it twists out of the tongs and wraps its coarse legs around her hand!! A spider trapping a sparrow. 
SIRI Shit!! Get it!  Get it! 
SNAP!  It bites her hand between index and forefinger. 
Susan pins the insect into the corkboard. It spins furiously, like a crazy LP record. 
Susan gets a grip on it again with the tongs.  Siri uses more pins to secure it down. 
SUSAN (Noticing Siri's hand) It bit you. 
SIRI No shit. 
SUSAN 
leans to get a closer look at the NYMPH: Deep dark brown, flat as a pancake, one rear leg broken, lower tail smashed. 
It squirms helplessly now, looking pitiful under the harsh overhead light. 
SUSAN This wing configuration. I've never... 
SIRI (looking at her injury) Fuck! It broke the skin... 
SUSAN And they're not fully developed.  This thing's not even an adult. 
The nymph continues to HISS and FOAM, struggling against the steel pins. Susan looks closely at the insect's belly. 
SUSAN My God. 
SIRI What? 
Susan gestures to look.  Siri stares down at 
THE NYMPH'S TORSO 
where a SET OF VALVES on its underside click in and out. 
SUSAN (OS) It's breathing. 
SIRI 
shakes her head. 
EXT. FLOPHOUSE - NIGHT 
The last DOH van takes off under the heavy rain. 
Across the street, Chuy looks down from his apartment window. 
INT. MANNY'S APARTMENT - SAME 
Chuy sits at the window, twisting wire into a human-like figure.  MOVING past him, we see a group of other WIRE FIGURES on the table, backs of chairs, lamps, everywhere. 
Manny sits at the kitchen table. He IGNITES a can of shoe polish with a match, then lights a cigarette off the flame. 
He puts the cigarette in his mouth and proceeds to polish a pair of shoes. A SILLY SHOW plays over the TV. 
MANNY Not too little, not too much. You rub it in, around and around like this. Let the leather take it. 
Manny leans tiredly against the table. He looks fatigued and in pain. He takes a small pill and places it under his tongue. 
MANNY You watching? You should learn to work the shoes. You're good with your hands... 
Manny shoots a glance over to his grandson. 
MANNY Chuy...you gonna get all wet. 
Chuy doesn't pay attention, just stares out at the street. 
MANNY Did you look at the story book I got you? 
Manny lifts a brightly colored CHILDREN'S BOOK. 
MANNY Our Animal Friends.  Can you say that, Chico?  "Friends"? 
Nothing from Chuy. 
CHUY'S POV - STREET 
The building across the street. Yellow DOH tape at the entrance. 
MANNY (OS) A friend is the one you can trust.  When you are with a friend, no matter where in the world, you are at home. 
A FIGURE moves out of the shadows and totters in the rain toward the entrance.  It is the OVERCOAT MAN, barely visible in the rain. 
MANNY In this city. A friend is a hard thing to find... 
CHUY 
His face shows a bit of animation. 
CHUY Funny Shoes... 
Manny looks up from the book. 
CHUY Alli.  Mr. Funny Shoes. 
Manny comes over, looks out. 
THEIR POV 
The figure has disappeared into the dark front of the boarded-up building. 
MANNY AND CHUY 
MANNY No one is there. Is empty. 
Chuy doesn't respond.  Manny turns the boy's face to his. 
MANNY Chuy, listen to me.  They have Jesus on the cross, but that is not a holy place. You understand? 
Chuy looks at him blankly.  Manny sighs; he knows he doesn't. 
MANNY Ah, Nino.  God only knows what goes on in your head, eh? 
He pats the boy on the head, then goes back to work. Chuy turns back to stare at the street. 
CHUY Mr. Funny Shoes... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. OUTSIDE TYLER APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT 
The D.O.H. Van pulls up in front of a modest Pre-war building. Josh and Peter climb out. 
Peter is reviewing a roster. 
PETER Josh, what was Immigration's countdown? 
Josh hands Peter a plastic bag with his sweat clothes and running shoes. 
JOSH Thirty-three workers. 
Peter hands him the roster. 
PETER There are thirty five listed in the reverend Wong's roster... 
JOSH Shit. 
Peter walks up the front steps. 
PETER Remember what that woman said, about people being taken? Check with the copsin the area. 
INT. TYLER APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Peter enters the apartment, which has long since been remodeled with a nicer couch and a bigger TV with slightly better reception. 
PETER Sus? 
Susan walks forward. 
SUSAN We're here to deal. 
Long beat.  The door to the clubhouse swings open. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SUBWAY STATION - DAY 
A BLUR of subway cars goes by with an ear-pulverizing SOUND. 
At the end of the platform, Davis untwists a wire around the busted lock of a locker room door. Peter paces nervously nearby. 
PETER Here, let me... 
He starts on it himself. Meanwhile, Ricky stares at a PHOTOGRAPH Susan has given to him:  a ribbed, tortoise- brown colored EGGCASE. 
SUSAN You sure you didn't see one of these? 
RICKY Gross. What is it? 
SUSAN An "Ootheca". An eggcase. It probably had more, uh "weirdbugs" inside. 
RICKY (shakes his head) No way. I see one of those, I'd puke. 
Davis opens the door with a CLICK. 
INT. SUBWAY LOCKER ROOM 
A dark, abandoned LOCKER ROOM once used for transit workers. 
Susan and Peter walk in with the boys, nervous in the off- limits area. 
DAVIS It was in that corner over there. 
Davis points to a bank of dented metal LOCKERS. 
RICKY Sucker was fast, man. (Picks up a pipe.) Had to take it out with one a these. 
PETER Okay, guys.  We'll take it from here. 
Peter hands Ricky some money. The boy looksdown at it slyly. 
RICKY Make it ten an' we won't tell the cops you're here. 
Peter regards the little scam artist dryly. 
PETER Let's keep it at five and I won't condemn your clubhouse. 
Peter hands him a couple of dollars more. The two boys take off. 
Peter removes a PENLIGHT from his pocket. 
Dust covers everything. A forest of COPPER TUBING and PIPES where the sinks used to be. 
PETER 
inspects the floor. It's littered with cheap objects: chipped combs, used rubbers, soggy newspapers, smeared heroin syringes. 
Something shiny catches his eye. He picks it up. 
PETER (quietly) Look, a broken tooth... 
Something rustles nearby. 
He notices an old, rotting poster on the back wall.  It seems ODDLY TEXTURED somehow.  He walks toward it. 
SUSAN 
kneeling, pushes aside a dented trash bin. Behind it, there is a cabinet with rusty sliding doors. 
A SUBWAY TRAIN RUMBLES by outside, the sound echoes off the tile walls. 
Susan forces the door back. She peeks through the opening. 
Her face stares back at her from a dirty pocket mirror. She starts pulling something out. 
PETER 
at the oddly texture wall.  He shines the penlight at it... 
...and is met with a FLUTTER OF WINGS.  MOTHS, perfectly camouflaged against the poster on the wall, whiz past him. 
Peter recoils. 
SUSAN (OS) You okay? 
He nods. 
SUSAN 
turns back to her locker.  She withdraws a cheap PLASTIC NECKLACE from it.  As she removes it, it breaks.  A coulpe of beads fall away... 
...rolls under the locker... 
...and BOUNCE -- once, twice, thrice -- each time going deeper till they comes to a stop. 
Susan peers where the beads fell. 
SUSAN There's something under here. 
Peter comes over, kneels by her. Susan takes a handful of beads and throws them at the base of the locker. 
CAMERA TRACKS to follow one of them. It rolls all the way under. 
Susan watches in wonder as the boy begins to use the spoons to IMITATE the different rhythmical step patterns of the VARIOUS COMMUTERS: The rolling, comical gait of A FAT MAN, the lithe haughty step of A PRIM LADY. 
SUSAN (Laughs.  To Chuy.) That's wonderful!  What grade are you in? 
Chuy doesn't answer. 
ERNEST No school. Shoes're all Chuy knows about. 
Ernest discreetly points to his forehead. 
MANNY (immediately) He's special. 
LEONARD He can imitate anything, you just watch him. 
PETER (Irritably, to Leonard) Excuse me, I'm talking to you. 
LEONARD No, you talkin' at me. 
Leonard hands Manny a $5.00 bill for the shine, gets up and walks past Peter as if he were invisible. 
ERNEST (discreetly, to Susan) Is there some reward for this? 
SUSAN I guess that could be arranged. 
Ernest smiles, pockets the ootheca picture. 
PETER For Chrissakes.  You gonna lay a two- bit bureaucratic, territorial number on me? 
LEONARD You wanna keep up the conversation, you best come back with the proper permits and the right attitude. 
Leonard saunters away with Ernest in tow. 
Peter shakes his head angrily.  He takes Susan by the arm, heads off in another direction. 
Chuy, without watching, clicks his spoons to the imitation of their steps. 
INT. SUBWAY STAIRS - DAY 
Susan and Peter walk up the stairs; Peter still fumes. 
PETER You give someone a fucking uniform and... Did you hear how he talked to us? 
SUSAN I heard how you talked to him. 
PETER Oh, so I'm the bad guy now? 
Susan spares him an ironic look. 
SUSAN He was just doing his job. 
PETER Fine, then I'm the bad guy. Jesus! 
At the top of the stairs they're completely engulfed by sunlight. 
PETER He wants a permit, I'll get him a permit. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SUBWAY TRACKS - DUSK 
A train blurs by. 
A FLASHLIGHT BEAM over dirty gravel.  TILT with the beam to see Ernest walking his beat past TRACKS and GIRDERS.  Hulking out-of-service SUBWAY CARS surround him. He shines his light on the ootheca picture and then around him at the walls. 
A SOUND catches his attention.  A RUSTLING. 
He notices something off to a corner, walks over to it. 
A SHINY BROWN LUMP in the corner, covered in garbage. 
He touches the lump with his shoe.  It STIRS slightly. 
He touches it again... 
...and a PAIR OF LEGS suddenly LASH OUT, kicking at him reflexively. 
Ernest jumps back. 
Another SET OF LEGS emerges... 
Oddly enough, Ernest relaxes. 
ERNEST Chrissakes... 
He grabs the surface of the lump, and pulls it.  We see that it was just a SHINY BROWN TARP. 
Underneath, a group of THREE HOMELESS PEOPLE -- emaciated, toothless -- sleeping intertwined for warmth. In the dim light, they almost seem like a single organism. 
ERNEST Guys, c'mon. 
The Homeless People stare back at him mutely.  Ernest starts getting annoyed. 
ERNEST I told you to stick by the maintenance area. 
BAG LADY Nah... It's private property now. 
Ernest looks at her, confused. 
SKELETAL BUM He eats down there. 
ERNEST Who? 
HOMELESS MAN The Stickman. 
BAG LADY Long John. 
approaches Susan.  She's staring through thr glass panes of the exhibit at the crowd of patrons.  In the refraction, their black tuxedoes and evening gowns seem to blend into one another. 
PETER Great crowd. 
SUSAN No such thing, baby. 
She looks over at the crowd congregated around the buffet table. 
SUSAN I get the feeling they came more for the potroast than the apterids. 
PETER Fuck 'em.  They don't know what they're missing. 
SUSAN (Distantly) Right. 
Peter looks at her. 
PETER What's wrong? 
Susan sighs. 
SUSAN Oh...nothing that a little menopausal's pee daikiri couldn't cure. Least that's what I thought. 
Peter looks at her, notices that one of her hands is on her stomach. 
PETER (genuinely moved) Oh, no, you were- 
SUSAN I was just late. 
Susan nods.  Peter takes her hand. They sit by the ant mound. 
SUSAN Ironic, don't you think?  These guys can hatch hundreds of offspring in a single clutch of eggs, right? And here we are... 
PETER Susan, we're not b- 
SIRI (OS) Susan? 
Susan looks up to see Siri standing on the other side of the glass case. 
SIRI (Weakly.) I'm sorry.  I think...I need... 
One of her eyes is completely bloodshot. Her mouth is bleeding. She puts her hand on the case to steady herself. 
Her fingers leave a STREAK OF BLOOD on the glass. 
SUSAN Siri... 
Siri collapses.  The exhibit tips over. 
Peter pulls Susan out of the way just as the exhibit FALLS AND SMASHES TO THE GROUND! 
SUSAN Siri! 
The room erupts into COMMOTION. 
Susan and Peter run to Siri, who lies unconscious on the floor. 
Peter gently turns her over. 
Siri's BLEEDING from the corner of her mouth.  Just like the Chinese workers in the sweatshop. 
Tuxedoed people encircle her next to the insect mounds. 
SMASH CUT TO: 
EXT. NEW YORK STREET - NIGHT 
An ambulance races down the avenue toward a distant hospital. 
INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY 
Siri is rushed on a gurney toward the Emergency Room. 
Peter and Susan walk next to it talking to DR. CHRIS RAYMOND, a 35-year old ER physician. 
PETER ...I think it's some kind of systemic infection, Chris.  I saw a few cases like it yesterday. A sweatshop in Canal. 
RAYMOND (to Peter.) Okay, look.  You better come in with me.  Help me through. 
INT. EMERGENCY ROOM 
Raymond, Peter, and several other ER STAFF work on Siri, now lying on an operating table. 
RAYMOND (To Peter) All hands on deck, Pete. Remember the dril? 
PETER It'll come back to me. 
RAYMOND inspects Siri's wounded hand.  The bandage has been removed.  The bite-wound is infected and suppurating.  A large red circular RASH around it. 
PETER Looks like a Lyme disease rash. 
RAYMOND It's not consistent with the internal bleeding. Any idea what bit her? 
Peter shakes his head. 
RAYMOND I think we're gonna need to have that specimen here. 
An ASSISTANT finishes inserting a catheter down her throat. 
Blood and fluid leak up through the clear tube. 
ABOVE THE OPERATING THEATER. 
Staring down through the circular glass deck, Susan silently observes the procedures. 
CUT TO: 
He leans over, kisses her gently.  But Susan seems hardly reassured. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MANNY'S APARTMENT - PREDAWN 
The blue hours before dawn. Laconic movement outside.  New York dragging itself out of bed. 
We FIND Manny fixing some melted cheese sandwiches on a hot plate. He addresses Chuy's tented bed behind him. 
MANNY My father saw me stay in bed, he'd go get a pitcher. Cold water, whoosh, I tell you that's some alarm clock, brrrrr! 
Manny cuts the bread in four equal sections and arranges them in a star-shaped pattern. A breakfast ritual of some kind. 
MANNY Ah! There you go! The way you like 'em, Chu-chu... (He pours a glass of milk.) We're low on milk, you remind Grampa to pick some up tonight, okay? 
He walks over to Chuy's tent bed. He pulls the sheets aside. 
His grandson is gone. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SEWAGE FILTRATION PLANT - PREDAWN 
Sewage water BUBBLES in huge tanks. 
A WORKMAN walks down catwalks above the tank, disengaging the larger pieces of debris from the filter areas with grappling hooks.  Shoes, tires, rags... 
A GRINDING SOUND is heard.  The Workman YELLS out to a CONTROL BOOTH above. 
WORKMAN Hold up!  We gotta block on filter D. 
SOUND of the pump coming to a halt. 
The Workman walks to the filter area.  He sinks his grappling hook into the polluted waters. 
UNDERWATER SHOT 
Spooky, silent. The grappling hook moves like a scythe to the filter... 
...past long, soft filaments of RAGGED TISSUE... 
...and connects with a LARGER FORM. 
ABOVE WATER 
The Workman feels the grappling hook connecting.  He gives a YANK, hooking whatever it is. 
He begins pulling it up. 
A PALE FORM bubbles to the surface. 
The Workman's face goes pale. 
WORKMAN Oh, God... 
A grating VOICE from the control booth is heard over the P.A. 
CONTROL BOOTH VOICE What's the problem? 
It take the Workman a moment to speak. 
WORKMAN I think it's a baby! 
The Workman pulls the form (as if that will do any good) toward the edge of the tank. 
He bends down, and now gets his first good look at it. 
The Workman SCREAMS. 
His grappling hook falls from his hand, into the sewage. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HOSPITAL - ICU WARD 
Susan watches Siri from behind a pane of glass.  Siri is connected to a respirator, her vital signs monitored by several machines. 
Raymond approaches Susan, two cups of coffee in his hands. 
RAYMOND How you feeling? 
SUSAN You tell me. 
He smiles, gives her one of the cups. 
RAYMOND Your blood tests were all negative. You checked out. 
Susan visibly relaxes.  She looks back at the ICU ward. 
SUSAN What about Siri? 
RAYMOND She's stable.  I don't think there's any immediate danger, but we'll have to keep her under observation... 
SUSAN You think it's some form of Strickler's, don't you? 
Beat.  Raymond shrugs. 
RAYMOND Pathology's still working on the tissue samples.  If it is...it must be an errant strain.  Shorter incubation period. (Beat.) I'm sorry, Sue.  We just don't know yet. 
INT. HOSPITAL - BATHROOM 
At the sink, Susan runs water over her hands, her face, trying to collect herself.  She looks up in the mirror. We see that her eyes are swollen, tear-stained. 
INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY 
Josh flashes the ultra-violet light over an abandoned underground encampment, made of cardboard walls, electrical wiring, elaborate debris kitchens. The walls are completely taken by layer after layer of hand carved initials and messages. Everything from "Kilroy was here" to elaborate quotations from the bible. 
JOSH There's really people living down here? 
LEONARD Mole people. This section was pretty popular, all the way to Fulton Street... 
Their flashlights shine in a haze of brown dust. The air is heavy. 
LEONARD Substance abusers, mental cases... Then about a year ago, Poof! All gone. Rumors got started... Someone found a couple of stiffs... 
They work their way down a steep incline. They're covered in sweat. 
LEONARD Down here's the land of talk, see? So the wildest version goes the farthest. They mark that area with a sign or a drawing, and its as good as closed. (chuckles) We had one fella... for years said he was Bela Lugosi. Got him on Geraldo. 
Peter's cellular rings. He picks up -big static- 
INTERCUT WITH: 
MORGUE 
Susan's got the phone up on her shoulder, clamped against her ear. Raymond's cranking out a bunch of Polaroids. Color shots of the insect, from every angle. 
SUSAN It's me. Can you hear me? 
PETER (phone, barely audible) Yeah, barely. We haven't found anything down here. Nothing... 
Jeremy goes to the fridge for a beer. 
SUSAN I have. 
The fridge light plays over the large insects jaws. It makes out a few new ridges and valleys. Raymond snaps a couple of Polaroids. 
SUSAN I'm on my way. I've got something for you to look at... 
Susan notices something weird and undefinable about the contours of the claws... But she can't put her finger on it. 
BACK AT THE TUNNEL 
PETER We'll be back at the platform in... 
LEONARD 20 minutes. If you don't go sight-seeing anymore. 
PETER (To phone.) 20 minutes. (Beat.) Susan? 
The call is lost. Peter tries to change frequencies, but it's useless. 
Peter replaces the phone in his pocket.  He walks off. 
LEONARD Funny.  Shoulda seen some track bunnies by now. 
JOSH What? 
LEONARD Track bunnies.  Rats.  They're usually around. 
No one notices the OVERCOAT MAN carving on the wall. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MANNY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
On Manny's dining room table, a heap of unpolished shoes has accumulated. The radio is playing a sad, elegiac Tango. 
MANNY No, no, please understand... I can't wait that long. 
Looking disheveled and tired, Manny clutches the phone, listening intently. 
MANNY Please. I write it down. (he writes) 2... 8... 7... 3. What does this mean "case number"? Okay. So, now what?  When can you...? 
He holds a color snapshot of Chuy sitting on a mailbox. 
MANNY No, I can't wait...no, listen... 
Click. Manny slowly hangs up. He stares at his notepad, at the number 2873. 
MANNY Hijos de puta. 
He crumples it up, throws it away, crosses to the window, picks up Chuy's last wire figure- 
FIGURE, CLOSER 
Another human-looking figure, long and thin, but with something slightly off about it. 
It has six limbs instead of four! 
MANNY 
frowns, looks down at the dark flophouse across the street. 
MANNY Mr. Funny Shoes. 
Distant thunder is heard. 
BATHROOM CABINET 
Manny takes a STRAIGHT RAZOR from the bathroom cabinet, opens the blade. 
EXT. SUBWAY STATION - DAY 
Susan arrives at the stairs leading down to the subway station. A COUPLE passes her on their way up. 
A sign over the entrance says "STATION WILL CLOSE FOR REPAIRS AT 3 PM - TOKENS ONLY". Susan looks around- the area is semi- deserted, a bit creepy. 
She takes a deep breath, descends. 
INT. SUBWAY - DAY 
Manny lands on his feet with considerable difficulty. He flicks his lighter flame and opens the straight razor. 
This pipe is carpeted with trash and a thick crust of dirt. Something moves under a wet newspaper: a thick mass of long- legged spiders dissolve onto the walls and floor. 
Suddenly...the distant sound of spoons playing. 
MANNY Chuy... 
Manny pulls a rosary from his pocket, wraps it around his wrist and crosses himself with the razor... 
...then begins to move down the pipe. 
CUT TO: 
PLATFORM "A" DELANCEY 
Susan examines the Polaroids.  She pulls out a payday bar. 
The crew of repairmen are leaving. 
REPAIRMAN Hey, Lady, all power will be down in five minutes, okay? 
SUSAN Okay.... 
She munches on the bar. She stops: one snapshot has caught her attention.  The fridge light illuminated this photograph. 
Susan turns it around... and around... Trying to find something different in the lines. 
A train roars by. 
Then she notices it: 
THE POLAROID 
The closed jaws. They look like A HUMAN FACE. 
SUSAN 
Gets up nervously and heads for the dor to the locker room. 
A whole row of lamps goes off. The rest flickers in and out. 
Then we see, now standing on her platform: THE OVERCOAT MAN!! He looks at her between a row of columns under the dead neon lights. 
Susan tries the locker room door. It's unlocked. 
INT. LOCKER ROOM - SUSAN 
carefully crosses the floor to the bank of lockers. 
She kneels to examine the hole in the wall.  She nears a noise. 
THE OVERCOAT MAN is moving toward her. 
SUSAN Peter? 
OVERCOAT MAN 
The man's face TIPS BACK... 
...raising the complex, glittering INSECT HEAD FROM BEHIND ITS MASK-LIKE FRONT JAWS. 
Its multi-parted MOUTH clicks OPEN. 
Susan SCREAMS! 
The thing charges, its "coat" opening to reveal...SIX LEATHERY WINGS, fully extended! The wingspan blocks the whole tunnel, they vibrate rapidly. 
Susan tries to run, but the creature -- hereafter known simply as "The Mimic" -- LEAPS ONTO HER CHEST! 
She's dragged screaming into the hole. 
Their silhouettes recede rapidly amidst a confusion of legs, wings and pipes. 
CUT TO: 
INT. VAULTED AREA 
Peter and Josh put the fecal samples into the back-pack. 
Leonard stands at the other end of the area. He inspects some OLD SCAFFOLDING set up at an opening which leads to 
THE REMAINS OF AN OLD STATION 
fifteen feet below. 
LEONARD I've never been this deep. This area here is the Old Armory station. They built it in the 40's. Ran out of money half-way through... 
It's like Grand Central's dead little brother. Tiled mosaic walls, columns, monumental arches. Spaces for shops. A group of abandoned turn-of-the-century subway cars on parallel tracks. 
LEONARD Okay, the fat lady's singing. Time to go. 
Everything is gray with dust. 
PETER (O.S.) (To Josh) I want a team in here by six tonight, hands and knees with toothpicks... 
Leonard squints down at the planks of the scaffolding. 
A NYMPH -- big as the one seen earlier -- emerges from a pile of nearby feces as if it were part of the mound. 
Keeping his eyes fixed on the insect, Leonard coolly bends down, picks up a ROCK. 
PETER 
putting the last sample boxes into the back-pack, looks up and sees 
SUSAN'S HAND 
Her fingers close around a three-foot piece of RUSTY PIPE. 
Something dark drips on her hand. 
SUSAN 
looks up. Above her, a badly decomposing HUMAN FOOT, or what is left of it.  All part of the excarnated corpse of the Chinese Preacher.  His gold cross shines boldly in the dark. 
Susan GASPS. 
THE MIMIC 
hears the sound.  It immediately SKITTERS back to her. 
SUSAN 
jerks herself sideways... 
AND STABS THE PIPE into the Mimic's thorax with a wet CRRK! 
Susan heaves herself up, pushing the thing onto its back. 
The Mimic BUZZES furiously, milky WHITE FOAM pumping from the wound.  Its legs slash the air as it tries to right itself. 
Susan runs for the tunnels, debris falling from her clothing. 
CUT TO: 
JOSH 
comes to a t-junction.  He checks his notepad for the appropriate direction. 
He turns, heads left. 
CUT TO: 
INT. TUNNELS 
Susan staggers through a dark PASSAGEWAY.  Water drizzles into her grimy face.  She looks up. 
Rain leaks from an overhead grate three stories up.  She can see the SHOES of PEOPLE walking to and fro above. 
SUSAN HELP!!! 
EXT. STREET ABOVE - NIGHT 
Life as usual on Delancey street. 
Pedestrians crisscross the metal grate, hunched under their umbrellas.  Traffic noise, T.V. displays on street front stores, boom boxes, car horns... 
They drown out the tiny sound of Susan's voice... 
SUSAN 
hears distant FEET SCURRYING toward her, punctuated by a metallic CLANG!  CLANG!  CLANG! 
SIDE TUNNEL 
CLANG!  The metal pipe, still imbedded in the Mimic, BANGS the wall as the insect moves down the dripping narrow tunnel. 
SUSAN 
looks around frantically.  She crosses to a METAL LID on the floor, lifts it. 
A HOLE is below, dropping off into darkness. 
The Mimic's CLANGING grows louder. 
Susan sits herself on the edge of the hole, grasping the metal lid by handles on its underside. 
The Mimic rushes into the chamber, speeding toward her... 
Susan JUMPS into the hole, hanging onto the lid... 
WHANG!  The lid SLAMS SHUT over the hole a fraction of a second before the creature reaches it. 
The Mimic touches the lid with its antennae, confused. 
INT. HOLE 
The TICK-TICKING of the Mimic's antennae scanning the lid. 
Susan hangs from the handles on the lid, her arms trembling. 
Susan's strength gives out.  She lets go, falls. 
PIPE GALLERY 
Susan CRASHES onto a juncture between two large PIPES. 
She MOANS in pain. 
CLOSER - SUSAN 
secures her position, looks down.  A seemingly bottomless pit below, crisscrossed with a FOREST OF PIPES AND DUCTS. 
The nearest pipe above her is well beyond reach. 
She is trapped. 
Then she hears the SOUND of the LID OPENING above.  She holds her breath. 
A faint YELLOW LIGHT of a lighter flickers down at her. 
Peter approaches him. 
PETER For Chrissakes, what's the problem? You need a memo every time you fart? 
LEONARD All right, motherfucker, that's it. 
He pushes Peter violently. Their eyes lock and meet. Inches away from a fistfight. 
PETER Shh! Shh! 
A SOUND rushing towards them, its echoes increasing by the second. 
Where is it coming from? 
Peter looks at Leonard.  Leonard unbuttons his holster clip, places his hand on his .22 
A SHADOW appears outside the archway. 
It steps onto the platform. 
Leonard frowns. 
LEONARD (tentative) Manny?! 
The old man stumbles out of the darkness, out of breath. A rusted crowbar in his hand. 
Leonard walks over to him solicitously. 
LEONARD My God, what the hell are you...? 
MANNY Hurry, the woman needs help! 
A shadow crosses Peter's face. 
PETER Woman? 
CUT TO: 
INT. PIPE GALLERY 
OUTSTRETCHED HANDS in the darkness. 
REVEAL Peter leaning across the void with one hand while Manny and Leonard grip his other. 
Susan below, balancing precariously on the crisscrossing pipes. A mess, but still alive.  She reaches up to Peter. 
It's too far. 
SUSAN (A whisper) Don't. 
PETER Listen to me:  we're getting you out. 
Leonard and Manny pull Peter back into 
INT. TUNNELS 
Peter undoes his belt. 
PETER (To Manny and Leonard) Give me your belts. 
They obey. Peter buckles them together with his. He then loops one end around a bannister, the other around his wrist. 
LEONARD (to Manny, as he ties them together) What are you doing down here? 
MANNY Chuy. He was taken. He's down here somewhere... (to Peter) Oh, please, hurry. I saw what was after her. 
PETER What's...? 
MANNY Just hurry. 
Peter takes his word for it.  He uses the belts to lower himself to the nearest pipe. 
Leonard LIGHTS a flare to illuminate the pipe gallery. 
Peter works his way down. The web of pipes seem to recede into Hades. 
The lifeline tightens. 
Peter gets to the last solid footing, lies down on his stomach and lets the belts down. 
PETER I'm coming, Sus, I'm coming. 
But then, he sees something move below her. Then a hollow CLANG! CLANG! CLANG! 
SUSAN No, Jesus, no. 
PETER (To Leonard) Toss the flare down! 
LEONARD I only got... 
PETER Just do it! 
Leonard lets the flare drop from his hand. 
It falls past them, ricocheting off the maze of pipes, spinning down to the pitch-black below. 
And for a split second the flame illuminates... 
THE MIMIC 
pipe in its thorax, nimbly CLIMBING THE PIPES TOWARD SUSAN CLANG! CLANG! CLANG! 
PETER'S 
eyes grow huge. 
LEONARD What the fuck was that? 
Peter says nothing. Leonard grabs him by the shirt. 
LEONARD You better tell me what the hell's going on here! 
MANNY Hey, hey!! Take it easy!! 
PETER (to Leonard) We don't know!! We don't know what it is! 
Leonard releases Peter and, cocking his gun moves closer to the still thing. 
PETER Wait a minute- 
LEONARD Fuck you, wait a minute. I'm going to- 
SNAP!  The Mimic POUNCES on him, catching his leg in its front mandibles. 
A sickening CRUNCH as the Mimic's mouth begins to work the leg like a grinder-blender. 
LEONARD GET IT!  GET IT OFF ME! 
Peter and Manny try to pull the thing off as Leonard falls and writhes on the floor. 
BAM! BAM! BAM! The men flinch away as Leonard empties his guns on it, until the thing's shell finally CRACKS! 
But the thing is still locked onto Leonard's leg.  Peter tries to work it free from the creature's jaws. No good. 
PETER Its muscles are locked. 
LEONARD (Hoarse) Oh, Jesus!! 
MANNY Wait... 
Manny removes a can of shoe polish from his coat, then starts smearing the stuff onto the Mimic's head and jaws. 
LEONARD Oh, Jesus! It's hitting the bone man, get it off!! 
He lights a CIGARETTE LIGHTER, goes to touch the flame to the flammable stuff. 
PETER (Stopping him.) Hey hey hey... 
MANNY Is how we make loose the ticks back home. 
Peter hesitates, but lets him go.  Manny lights the polish. 
WHOOSH...the Mimic's head is engulfed in a halo of flame. THE LEGS LOOSEN THEIR GRIP. 
Peter and Manny yank it free from Leonard, who's PASSED OUT from the pain.  His leg is torn and bloody. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SUBWAY REPAIR CAR - LATER 
We now see the car is 50's vintage.  A POSTER of Mickey Mantle above an empty worktable. 
Peter sits before Susan.  She's trembling, understandably shaken from her previous experience.  BLOOD pours from a CUT on her forehead. 
Peter takes a bit of torn cloth, puts it to the wound, then tenderly raises her hand to keep the bandage in place. 
PETER Just keep holding it.  Can you do that for me? (No reponse.) Susan? 
Susan nods silently.  Her hand weakly presses the compress. 
MANNY (OS) Doctor Tyler? 
He turns to Manny, who sits solicitously next to Leonard. His wound is wrapped with makeshift bandages. He begins to stir. 
Peter gets up, but Susan's hand is closed tightly around his, like the jaws of the Mimic.  He kisses her gently, then slowly manages to release his hand. 
He walks to Leonard, inspects his wound. Touches the sole of his foot. 
PETER You feel anything? 
LEONARD Yeah, I feel like ripping your fucking eyes out... 
PETER Leonard, listen.  I need to see if there's any nerve damage before we carry you back. (No response.) Look, I'm trying to help you here... 
LEONARD Oh, you helped me here, all right, white boy.  You and your goddam memo. You needed to prove your point, uh? 
PETER I'm sorry.  But I don't think letting you bleed to death is the best apology. 
Peter touches his foot again. Leonard finally nods. 
Manny gazes at the Mimic carcass at the end of the car. 
MANNY Where the hell'd that thing come from? 
Peter looks at Susan.  She remains silent. 
PETER (Quietly) A mistake. 
LEONARD "Mistake"?  What's that supposed to...? 
PETER It doesn't matter, all right?  It's dead. 
LEONARD How you know that?  Shit, it was runnin' around with its buttside gone and a fucking pipe through its heart... 
SUSAN (Quietly) It doesn't have a heart. 
Peter looks up at her. 
SUSAN Just inner chambers... 
MANNY But it look like a man. It... I saw it. 
PETER (hissing a whisper) They're coming! 
OUTSIDE 
The shadows get nearer, their CLICKING louder... 
CONTROL BOOTH 
Susan looks under the dashboard, finds a HEXAGONAL SHAPED ROD.  The lever crank. 
SUSAN I got it! 
Susan gives it to Leonard. He JAMS the rod into the hexagonal shaped hole.  Perfect fit. 
Leonard begins CRANKING the thing.  But it's rusty and slow... 
SUSAN Hurry! Please! 
THROUGHOUT SUBWAY CAR 
The doors begin to swing shut very slowly. 
OUTSIDE - A MIMIC'S POV 
sees the moving doors, starts heading for them. 
CONTROL BOOTH 
Leonard can't crank fast enough.  Susan joins in, putting her hands over Leonard's.  Both spin the thing as fast as possible. 
SUBWAY CAR 
Peter and Manny each pulling on a door, trying to speed up the closing process. 
SHADOWS are seen approaching, now very close. 
CONTROL BOOTH 
Leonard and Susan put all their effort into turning the crank one more time... 
LEONARD Come on, you son-of-a... 
SUBWAY CAR 
A SOFT CLICK as the doors SHUT IN UNISON. 
Silence. 
All four are stock still, like a submarine crew awaiting the blast of depth charges.  Their eyes dart to the 
WINDOWS 
caked with soot, irradiated by the distant glow of one of the red flares. 
THUCK! Something BUMPS against the door. 
A machine-gun patter of FOOTSTEPS on the roof. 
The car SHAKES. 
OUTSIDE 
The dark platform is alive with phantom shapes. 
INSIDE 
SCREEECH!! Something sharp is drawn along the car roof like a nail over a chalkboard. 
THUMP! THUMP!  Impacts on the sides... 
An obscene symphony of sounds as Mimics lay siege to the car. 
PETER 
A BUZZ OF WINGS catches his attention.  He turns.  His face is reflected in a security window. 
CRACK!  The window SPLINTERS, destroying Peter's reflection. 
ABOVE MANNY 
Claws SCRATCH the ceiling. It begins to dent. 
BELOW SUSAN AND LEONARD 
Large forms CLICKING underneath, looking for a way in. 
Susan stares at the floor, her eyes following the course of the clicking... 
...which leads to Leonard's wounded, bloodstained leg. 
SUSAN Oh, God. (Looks at Leonard.) The blood... 
KLANGGG!  A Mimic leg PIERCES the ceiling above them! 
Susan pulls Leonard out of the way just in time as 
IN THE SUBWAY CAR 
KLANG!  KLANG! More legs break through the ceiling! 
SUSAN AND LEONARD 
emerge from the control booth, Leonard's arm over Susan's shoulder. 
SUSAN His blood! It's driving them crazy! We have to mask the odor! 
Spoons. 
MANNY Chuy...? 
Manny follows the sound. 
BY THE TRACK 
Peter desperately tries to connect the wires the right way. He wipes off the brown gunk, tries to discern any semblance of color. 
He feels himself start to sweat.  He tries to relax. Breathes... 
INT. ROOM BEHIND SWITCHROOM 
The space is larger than the switchroom.  The walls and ceiling have an odd, shiny consistency. 
Manny heads in further, locates the levers and waits. 
Something pale and small emerges from the dark, a few feet away, a face that seems to float in the eerie half-light. 
A RUSTLING behind him.  Manny turns around. 
MANNY (Whispering) Nino... 
He swings the light onto Chuy, sitting on the floor before the remains of a RUSTY COLUMN.  That beautiful, emotionless smile on his pale face. 
MANNY Chuy... 
BY THE POWERBOX 
Peter has made all the necessary connections.  He turns now to the fuse-section. 
A red throw-switch is there, and two big slots for fuses. 
One is still occupied. 
The other one empty. 
PETER Dammit! 
CU - PETER'S FOREHEAD 
BEADS OF SWEAT begin to form. 
SUBWAY CAR 
Susan watches the Mimics at their feast. 
All of a sudden, they begin to stop, as if losing interest. 
SUSAN (horrified) The scent's fading... 
Susan steps back, looks around desperately for a flashlight. 
LEONARD (tense as hell) What's Manny doing? I can't see him anymore. 
ROOM BEHIND SWITCHROOM 
MANNY Nino, please... 
Manny slaps his knees with both hands in a parental gesture of "come to me". 
In the darkness, something that looks like a PALM FROND floats gracefully down from the ceiling, making see-saw gestures as it falls through the air. 
Manny shines his flashlight on the floor.  It's not a palm frond. 
It's a wing. 
Manny turns his flashlight to the ceiling and walls. 
The place IS COVERED WITH MIMICS.  They are in the middle of a vicious mating ritual.  The males tear savagely at the females wings as they proceed to mount them.  A chaotic clusterfuck. 
Manny is sickened. 
CHUY GIGGLES. Manny shines his light ahead. Manny's face falls. 
MANNY Dios mio... 
The WHITE PILLAR BEHIND CHUY IS MOVING... 
...unfolding... 
...at last revealing... 
AN ALBINO MIMIC!  Another leap for evolution... 
Its form is different from the other Mimics.  Sleeker, more supple, almost beautiful.  And while its movements are still not completely human, there is a kind of unearthly grace to them that at the very least entrance us. 
The thing raises itself to full height, dwarfing the tiny boy.  It stands over him like a king over his court fool. 
Chuy giggles happily.  It's all a game to him. 
The Albino CLICKS in response -- a long, leisurely sound, as if trying to communicate with the boy. 
Chuy pulls his spoons out and begins to play them, making a perfect imitation of the sound. 
Manny starts to tremble as the creature gazes upon him with huge, expressionless 'eyes'.  He turns to Chuy- 
MANNY (barely audible) Chuy... 
CHUY (whispers) Friends. 
MANNY NO, NO, CHUY, NO... 
CHUY Friends. 
PETER I can.  We can do this... 
He shows her the first hand and foothold.  Susan grabs on. 
INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL 
The Albino amkes its way forward, flanked by two Mimics. 
It stops. 
Turns toward the elevator. 
INT. SHAFT 
Susan hauls herself up the framework, handhold by handhold. Peter is right below her. 
She can see his arms are starting to tremble dangerously with the effort. 
SUSAN We're gonna make it! 
Peter grinds his teeth, trying to make the next handhold. 
WHAM!  Something hits the gate below them! 
INT. BY THE ELEVATOR GATE 
The Mimics are tearing at the metal gate. 
The Albino remains still, watching them work. 
PETER AND SUSAN 
Susan's arm and legs are shaking now.  Her breath starts catching in her throat with the effort. 
PETER Don't hold your breath!  Keep it going, even flow! 
Susan tried, but can't.  She tries to pull herself up to the next level. 
PETER C'mon... 
SUSAN Ah... 
PETER Talk to me. 
SUSAN Peter... 
Susan pulls herself up. 
SUSUAN I'm really glad I'm not pregnant. 
REVERSE 
We look down past them as they climb.  Two of the Mimics and the Albino have gotten into the shaft! 
The Albino is so long it climbs by bracing its legs against opposite walls. 
SUSAN AND PETER 
Susan is crying, barely any strength left. 
Peter does his best to stay in control, but in truth is barely hanging on himself. 
LIGHT hits them from the shaft above now, SOUNDS of PEOPLE TALKING and a muffled P.A. ANNOUNCEMENT filter down. 
MIMICS 
rushing upward on the shaft wall, higher, higher. 
INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT 
Peter's hands grab onto the grating of the gate on the next floor. 
KCHUNK! is heard above them.  Peter looks up. 
Now the elevator is coming down. 
PETER Hang onto me. 
Peter pulls Susan up till she can grab it too, both of them able to get a foothold on the ledge- 
PETER Hang on tight! 
He begins to KICK on the gate, trying to tear it free.  Susan looks back down. 
SUSAN'S POV - SHAFT 
The Mimics rush up, closer, closer.  The Albino opens its mandibles. 
SUSAN AND PETER 
both KICK at the gate, it gives, Peter pulls Susan through to the 
INT. SUBWAY TRACK 
PETER Come on! 
Peter and Susan stumble away. 
INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT 
The Albino sees the elevator approaching from above. 
It gives a few CLICKS to its minions. 
The two other Mimics race up the shaft...

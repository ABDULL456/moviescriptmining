Revised Final Screenplay by 
Frank Nugent 
FADE IN 
Behind the main title and the credits: 
EXT. PLAINS COUNTRY - CLOSE SHOT - MOVING JUST ABOVE GROUND LEVEL - A STUDY OF HOOFPRINTS - LATE AFTERNOON 
The hoofprints are deeply etched in the ground, picking their way through scrubby desert growth. An occasional tumbleweed drifts with the light breeze across the pattern of prints; and lightly-blown soil and sand begin the work of erasing them. The CAMERA FOLLOWING the hoofprints 
RAISES SLOWLY TO: 
EXT. PLAINS COUNTRY - LONG SHOT - LATE AFTERNOON 
We see the rider now. BACK TO CAMERA, jogging slowly along -- heading down a long valley toward a still-distant ranch house with its outlying barn and corrals. 
EXT. PLAINS COUNTRY - MED. SHOT - MOVING - LATE AFTERNOON 
The CAMERA FRAMES and MOVES with the lone horseman. He is ETHAN EDWARDS, a man as hard as the country he is crossing. 
Ethan is in his forties, with a three-day stubble of beard. 
Dust is caked in the lines of his face and powders his clothing. He wears a long Confederate overcoat, torn at one pocket, patched and clumsily stitched at the elbows. 
His trousers are a faded blue with an off-color stripe down the legs where once there had been the yellow stripes of the Yankee cavalry. His saddle is Mexican and across it he carries a folded serape in place of the Texas poncho... 
Rider and horse have come a long way. The CAMERA HOLDS and PANS the rider past and we see another detail; strapped onto his saddle roll is a sabre and scabbard with a gray silk sash wrapped around it... Horse and rider pass, moving closer to the ranch as a little girl and a small dog come tearing around the corner of the house. 
EXT. THE YARD OF THE EDWARDS RANCH - MED. SHOT - DEBBIE - LATE AFTERNOON 
She is staring wide-eyed at the distant horseman o.s. 
Her little dog has seen him too and is barking excitedly. 
DEBBIE quickly reaches to grab the dog by the scruff of the neck, crouching over him. Debbie is 11 years old with a piquant, memorable face. 
EXT. THE YARD - CLOSE SHOT - DEBBIE 
Here we must establish and dramatize what it is about her face that is memorable, so that if we were to see her again five or six years later, we would know it is she -- perhaps the eye color or the slant of eyebrow, or a trick of scratching bridge of nose with crooked forefinger. 
EXT. THE EDWARDS HOUSE - MED. SHOT - AARON - LATE AFTERNOON 
The ranch house is of adobe, solidly built, with a sod and cross-timbered roof, deep windows. A small gallery or porch extends across the front. AARON EDWARDS comes through the door, attracted by the dog's barking -- and then he, too, sees the approaching horseman and comes farther out -- curious but not at all apprehensive. Aaron is a lean, weathered and tired man, with a down-swept mustache; a gentler-looking man than Ethan and possibly a few years older. 
As he squints off, studying the rider, his older daughter, LUCY, comes out to stand behind him. Lucy is from 16 to 18 -- a pleasant, feminine girl. She is carrying a mixing bowl with some sort of batter in it, which she now completely forgets to whip in her interest in the approaching stranger. 
In the next instant MARTHA EDWARDS follows the daughter onto the porch. Martha is a still-lovely woman, although the years have etched fine wrinkles about her eyes and mouth, and work has worn and coarsened her hands. Those hands will never be idle when Martha is on scene... And now, while she shares the family's interest in the approaching horseman, she automatically notes that Lucy has forgotten her task -- and she takes the mixing bowl from her and stirs the batter. 
EXT. YARD OF THE EDWARDS HOUSE - FULL SHOT - LATE AFTERNOON 
Along the side of the house comes BEN EDWARDS, 14, with a man-sized armload of chunkwood clutched to his chest. He, too, has spotted the stranger and is all attention. So much so that he trips, but recovers his footing. He pauses to dump the wood into a woodbox by the door -- his eyes always riveted on the oncoming rider -- and then he moves toward the others, biting a splinter out of a finger. Beyond Ben, MARTIN PAULEY emerges from the barn and crosses the open ground heading toward CAMERA. Martin is somewhat under 20, a lithe, perfectly coordinated male animal, with Indian-straight hair and a white man's eyes. He is carrying bridle or other horse-gear. He looks to the family on the porch -- to see if they recognize the stranger -- then out again. He continues, followed by Ben, toward where 
Debbie crouches over her dog. 
EXT. PLAINS COUNTRY - LONG SHOT - ETHAN - LATE AFTERNOON 
As he rides downslope toward the house. 
THE CREDITS END. 
EXT. THE EDWARDS RANCH - MED. CLOSE SHOT - MARTHA, LUCY, AND AARON - LATE AFTERNOON 
Suddenly, Martha's eyes widen as she -- even before Aaron -- recognizes the distant rider. Her hand goes to her mouth to check the name that trembles on her lips... An instant later Aaron, too, identifies the oncoming horseman. 
AARON (incredulous) Ethan? 
He looks at her, frowning, then slowly steps out onto the hard ground. Martha hands the bowl back to Lucy and follows Aaron. 
EXT. THE YARD OF THE EDWARDS HOUSE - FULL SHOT - THE GROUP 
as Ethan rides in and sits his horse, looking down at them. There is a noticeable constraint on all of them. Finally: 
ETHAN Hello, Aaron... 
His eyes shift to Martha and hold. Ethan is, and always has been, in love with his brother's wife and she with him. 
ETHAN Martha... 
MARTHA (a bit shakily) Hello, Ethan. 
Ethan slowly, stiffly swings out of the saddle. Aaron and Martha exchange quick glances... troubled, puzzled. Aaron pastes on an uncertain smile as Ethan comes around his horse toward their side. 
AARON How's California? 
ETHAN How should I know? 
AARON But Mose Harper said... 
ETHAN That old goat still creakin' around?... Whyn't someone bury him? 
He goes to his saddle pack, begins unlacing it. Ben and Debbie have inched closer -- half-shy, half-curious. 
Debbie's dog begins sniffing at his heels. Ethan looks down at them - not unfriendly, just a man not used to children. 
ETHAN Ben, ain't you? 
BEN Will you tell me tomorrow about the war? 
AARON The war ended three years ago, boy! 
BEN It did?... Then whyn't you come home before now? 
MARTHA BEN!... Go 'long with Martin. MARCH! 
As Ben reluctantly heads out with Martin, Deborah crosses to Ethan's side and studies him gravely. 
DEBBIE Lucy's wearing the gold locket you gave her when she was a little girl... 
ETHAN Oh? 
DEBBIE She don't wear it much account of it makes her neck green. 
LUCY (aghast) Deborah! 
DEBBIE (defensively) Well, it does... But I wouldn't care if you gave me a gold locket if it made my neck green or not. 
Ethan looks at her gravely. 
ETHAN 'Fraid I... (then he remembers something, rises) Wait. 
He crosses to where his pack is -- a side table or something -- and burrows into it. Debbie is at his side. 
ETHAN How about this? 
It is a gold medal or medallion -- something appropriate to Maximilian of Mexico -- suspended by a long multi-colored satin ribbon. 
DEBBIE Oh! LOOK! My gold locket! 
She holds it high for mother -- and all -- to see. Martha takes it and reacts at its weight. 
MARTHA It's solid gold... Ethan, I don't think she's old enough... 
ETHAN Let her keep it... Just something I picked up in Mexico. 
Martha reluctantly surrenders it to Debbie's eager hand. 
Aaron hasn't missed the word "Mexico" and looks sharply at Ethan. 
DEBBIE Oh, thank you, Uncle Ethan... 
LUCY (to Debbie) Come along... 
The two girls leave the main room. Martha and Aaron both look at Ethan -- half expecting some further explanation. 
He turns from them and looks into the fire. Martha begins to clear the table. Aaron gets up, takes a pipe and a spill -- lights it at the fire. 
ETHAN Passed the Todd place comin' in... What happened to 'em? 
AARON They gave up... went back to the cotton rows... So'd the Jamisons... Without Martha, I don't know... She wouldn't let a man quit. 
Ethan turns and looks at her -- still busy with her dishes. 
AARON (change of tone) Ethan, I could see it in you before the war... (Ethan looks at him) You wanted to clear out! 
Martha freezes in what she's doing -- listening. 
AARON And you stayed out beyond all need to... WHY? 
Ethan can't answer, but he takes it as a challenge and almost welcomes it. 
ETHAN (hard) You askin' me to clear out now? 
AARON (straightening -- with grave dignity) You're my brother... You're welcome to stay as long as you got a mind to... Ain't that so, Martha? 
MARTHA (almost a whisper) Of course he is. 
ETHAN I expect to pay my own way... 
Martha resumes her activity. Ethan crosses to his pack, reaches into it for a leather pouch, brings it back and tosses it onto the table. It lands with a resonant clink. 
Both Martha and Aaron draw close to the table. 
(NOTE TO WINTON HOCH: This scene should be dramatically back- lighted.) 
ETHAN There's sixty double eagles in there... twelve-hundred dollars. 
He opens a waistline shirt button and hauls out a leather money belt and drops that on the table. 
ETHAN An' twice that in here. 
He reaches into the belt and takes out a few mint-fresh gold pieces which he slides across the table. 
ETHAN ...only these got the late Emperor Maximilian's picture on 'em. 
Martha picks up one of the gold pieces, staring at the face on the coin: the same as that on the medal -- staring sharply then at Ethan. Aaron is examining another coin with a different interest. 
AARON Mint fresh... not a mark on 'em. 
He glances questioningly at Ethan. 
ETHAN So? 
Aaron shrugs and crosses to a barrel chair. He raises the seat and lifts out a pair of old boots, some rags of clothing and then raises a false-bottom lid and drops pouch and money belt into it. Carefully he replaces everything. During this Ethan's attention has gone to Martha's hand, to one cut finger, its wound barely healed. He takes the hand -- gently. 
ETHAN Cut yourself? 
She nods and withdraws the hand. 
JORGENSEN Mama!... Oh please... please no... BRAD! 
And with that one word, Jorgensen calls upon his son to follow and they take off... fast. Ed Nesby and Charlie MacCorry follow. Sam Clayton pauses. 
CLAYTON Jorgensen's place is closest... If they're not there, we'll come straight on! 
Then he too rides. Martin swings his horse back to where Ethan and Mose still are standing. 
MARTIN Well, come on! 
ETHAN Easy! (he starts toward his horse) It's forty miles, sonny... Horses can do with some grain and a little rest. 
MOSE Comanch generally hits at moonrise. 
MARTIN Moonrise!... It'll be midnight before... I ain't waitin'...! 
He wheels his horse and goes tearing to catch up with the others. Ethan shrugs and stoically takes grain bag to feed his horse. Mose does the same. 
MOSE Wisht it was Caddoes... or Kiowas... (shakes his head) Comanche... 
Ethan just gives him an angry look and then ruthlessly begins discarding every bit of unnecessary equipment from his saddle. 
WIPE TO: 
EXT. THE EDWARDS RANCH - WIDE ANGLE - SUNDOWN 
Nothing moves. Nothing could be more tranquil. The shadows are long. A thin wisp of smoke rises from the chimney. And then Debbie's little dog trots around the side of the house out into the yard. 
EXT. EDWARDS YARD - CLOSE SHOT - THE DOG - SUNDOWN 
He comes to a standstill and his nose is working. He begins to make excited little sounds deep in his belly. 
Then he lies down, muzzle between his paws, watching, listening. 
INT. THE EDWARDS HOUSE - FULL SHOT - ANGLING TOWARD 
THE DOOR 
Debbie sits on the floor, playing with a little rag doll. 
The slanting blaze of the setting sun makes a brilliant area of light in which she is sitting. Beyond her, on the porch steps, Ben is squatting, whittling a piece of pine into a slingshot frame. We hear Martha and Lucy busy with the dishes. Aaron comes from behind CAMERA and stands in the doorway, absently rapping out his pipe. Near the doorway, on a wooden peg, hangs his gun, belt. He puts the pipe in his pocket and glances down at Deborah, intent on her play. He looks swiftly at where the women are busy - then stealthily eases the gun from its holster and slides it under his shirt. He hasn't made a sound and is sure he's got away with it. 
He clears his throat noisily and reaches for a light shotgun pegged above the door. 
AARON Think I'll see if I can pick off a sage-hen or two, Martha... 
INT. THE EDWARDS HOUSE - MED. CLOSE SHOT - MARTHA AND LUCY 
busy at the wooden sink. Martha doesn't turn. 
MARTHA You do that, Aaron... 
AARON (still pleased with himself) Won't go far... 
He steps out. Only then does Martha turn -- and her 
EYES GO AT ONCE TO: 
INT. THE EDWARDS HOUSE - ANGLING TO DOOR 
and FRAMING the empty holster, as Aaron pauses on the porch. 
LUCY'S VOICE My, the days are getting shorter! 
INT. EDWARDS HOUSE - CLOSE SHOT - MARTHA AND LUCY 
as Lucy heads for the lamp. 
MARTHA (sharply) Lucy!... We don't need the lamp yet... 
Lucy frowns at her mother. 
MARTHA (easily) Let's enjoy the dusk a while. 
EXT. THE EDWARDS HOUSE - MED. CLOSE SHOT - AARON AND BEN - 
ON PORCH Aaron is slowly scanning the terrain. 
AARON (to Ben) Mind you sweep up them shavin's. 
BEN Yes, Pa... (undertone -- man to man) An' if you see any sage-hens, I'm ready. 
Aaron stares as the boy shifts a fold of blanket, or whatever, by his side -- to disclose Ethan's cavalry sabre. Aaron smiles and rubs the youngster's head, then sets out across the yard. 
EXT. THE EDWARDS YARD - FULL SHOT - MOVING 
Debbie's dog rises at Aaron's approach and joins his master as they set out across the plain. 
EXT. OPEN COUNTRY NEAR EDWARDS HOME - MED. CLOSE SHOT - 
AARON 
He is walking through the scrub and brush grass, every sense alive and straining. He pauses every three or four strides -- casting each quadrant in turn. Once he whips, gun ready, as a sage-hen or quail whirrs up not far from him. He smiles grimly as he watches it fly away. He keeps on. 
EXT. THE EDWARDS HOUSE - MED. CLOSE SHOT - AT PORCH 
Martha comes to stand in the doorway. Ben doesn't look at her. His eyes -- like hers -- are fixed on the figure of the man. 
BEN (quietly) It's all right, ma... I been watchin'...  Only I wish... 
MARTHA (quietly) What, Ben? 
MARTIN We'll find them, Mrs. Jorgensen... We'll find them... 
He swings into his saddle. Laurie impulsively runs to his side, steps onto the toe of his stirruped boot and pulls herself up to his level to kiss him hard and full upon the mouth. 
He looks at her dully, as though hardly conscious of it. And she is back beside her mother. Martin rides away after the others. 
MRS. JORGENSEN (slowly) I almost hope they don't find them! 
Laurie looks at her mother and understands. 
CUT TO: 
61-A 
EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - THE SEARCHERS - EARLY MORNING LIGHT 
The SEARCH THEME begins as we see the riders in turn. 
A series of portraits of the men. 
CLOSE SHOT - BRAD AND CHARLIE - riding point, they come to a pause, surveying the terrain ahead. Charlie, with an arm signal, indicates he will take the left. Brad nods and he rides out to the right. 
THE MAIN BODY OF THE MEN, Clayton passing first, expression resolute, competent... Then Ed Nesby and old Mose, squinting at the ground as they ride, all but sniffing like an old hound dog. 
63A 
MARTIN - Next to last in file. Finally: 
63B 
ETHAN - His face a study of relentless purpose. 
WIPE TO: 
OMITTED. 
EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - FULL SHOT - BRAD AND CHARLIE - AFTERNOON 
The two men are at a cairn of rocks -- their horses nearby. 
In the near distance, Clayton is leading the men of the search party at a fast clip toward the cairn. Charlie is standing, Brad tearing the rock cairn apart. In Charlie's hands is a Comanche head-dress of polished buffalo horn and feathers. Brad doesn't even look up as the men ride in and dismount, but continues his grim work of uncovering the buried Indian. 
CLAYTON Another one, eh? 
CHARLIE This 'un come a long way 'fore he died. 
CLAYTON Well, that's seven we can score up to your brother, Ethan. 
NESBY I don't like it. 
CLAYTON What don't you like? 
NESBY Injun's on a raid generly hides their dead so you won't know how many they've lost... If they don't care about us knowin', it only spells one thing... they ain't afraid of us followin' -- or of us catchin' up with 'em either. 
ETHAN You can back out any time, Nesby. 
NESBY Didn't say that... (angrily indicating Brad) What's he doin' that for... 
CHARLIE He wants to be sure... 
Brad shifts another rock and Looks grimly upon the face (O.S.) of the dead Comanche. Then he spits at it and stands. 
BRAD (grim) Let's get along... 
ETHAN (to Brad) Why don't you finish the job? 
With that he strides to the cairn, whipping a knife out. he crouches over the body (O.S.) concealing what he is doing, he bends to his bloody task. 
Sam Clayton crosses to stand behind him. 
CLAYTON (gravely) What good does that do? 
ETHAN By what you preach... none! 
He stands now and he faces Sam. 
ETHAN But by what the Comanche believe -- now he can't enter the spirit land, but has got to wander forever between the winds... because I took his mangy scalp! 
He flings the scalp down and grinds it into the dirt with his heel... He wipes clean the blade of his knife as he crosses back to his horse. The men mount (those who have dismounted) and they ride off. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
OMITTED 
EXT. NIGHT CAMP - RAVINE - CLOSE SHOT - BRAD AND MARTIN 
Brad is looking out into the night -- strain and tension in every line. Beyond them we may see some of the other men -- sitting or sprawled on the ground near a sheltered fire. 
BRAD (a whisper) If only she's alive... I'll make it up to her... No matter what's happened... I'll make her forget... She's just got to be alive... 
Ethan crosses behind them carrying his blanket roll. He looks at them sourly. 
ETHAN Get some rest! 
They move off, heading for their blankets. The CAMERA HOLDS on Ethan as he rolls up his blanket and turns on his side. 
He fishes a miniature out of his pocket and gravely studies it by the light of the flickering little fire. 
70-A 
CLOSE SHOT - THE MINIATURE - NIGHT 
EXT. CANYON COUNTRY - LONG SHOT - PAST THE SEARCHERS 
Another Indian file of eight angles out of a different canyon and begins to cut in toward the group -- riding slowly, very quietly. Clayton slightly alters course, veering slightly away from the converging files, but still riding slowly. And then, from ahead but at a 100 yards, another Comanche group seems to rise out of the ground and slowly begins closing the gap. 
ETHAN (to Clayton) If you were tryin' to surround 'em, you sure succeeded. 
CLAYTON How far's the river from here, Mose? 
MOSE I been baptized, Reverend... yes suh, been baptized, thank ye... 
CLAYTON Well, you better brace yourself for another one... Ya-HEE! 
And with that yell, he drives spurs and cuts sharply at an angle to the converging Indian files -- and every man is with him. In the next instant, the Comanches whoop and give chase. 
74-D 
EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - FULL SHOT - THE CHASE 
with the Ranger group short-cutting in such a way as to outstrip the Comanche horsemen in a mad dash for the river. 
74-E 
EXT. THE RIVER'S EDGE - FULL SHOT - THE GROUP 
Clayton flings his hand up in a signal to halt as the Rangers reach the bank. They rein in, wheel their horses and are reaching for the rifles as the Comanche vanguard races into view -- to find themselves opposed by seven veterans, sitting their horses, rifles at their shoulders. 
The charge breaks as the seven rifles bark, almost in unison -- and the Indians wheel to shelter. 
CLAYTON YA-HEE! 
And once again he spins his mount and takes off, across the river, followed by the others. 
74-F 
EXT. THE RIVER - FULL SHOT 
As the men pound across. 
74-G 
EXT. FAR BANK OF RIVER - FULL SHOT - THE GROUP 
They dismount and Charlie and Nesby take the horses and run them to some place of protection as the men group around Clayton and Ethan. During this: 
CLAYTON (shouting his orders) This is as good as any... Charlie, you and Ed take the horses... 
Mose runs over and crouches beside Ethan. Beyond Ethan is Martin, then Brad... Nesby and Charlie will rejoin the group after an appropriate interval... with all the men shielded behind river boulders, etc. 
EXT. RIVER'S EDGE - ANGLING PAST ETHAN AND MOSE WITH MARTIN AND BRAD BEYOND 
Ethan and Mose are hunkered down behind some rocks, very casual and business-like as they check rifles, set out and carefully wipe cartridges. 
MOSE (chattily) Minds me o' the time Joe Powers an' me fit us some Kiowas... 
Martin is in the throes of buck-fever, wiping mouth with back of his hand, peering anxiously across the river. 
MARTIN You think they mean to charge us, Uncle Ethan...? 
MOSE ...We found us an ole buffler wallow... 
BRAD (staring across river) Criminy! 
EXT. RIVER'S EDGE - LONG SHOT - PAST THE GROUP 
On the opposite bank, we see the full force of Comanches riding into sight -- racing their mounts to the edge, then wheeling off -- jeering, taunting. Brad starts to bring up his rifle. 
ETHAN Steady, Daniel Boone! You don't want to miss... It makes them think their medicine's stronger than yours... 
MOSE Ay-he... That's jest what I tole Joe Powers... That un's gettin' kinda sassy, ain't he, Ethan? 
One Comanche rides a few yards into the water, brandishing his rifle, taunting the white men. A moment later he is joined by a second brave. 
ETHAN (grimly) Real sassy. 
He and Mose slowly bring their rifles to bear -- and then the two shots crack out almost simultaneously. And within split seconds both Comanches fall. The others race away. 
Sam comes charging over to Ethan and Mose. 
CLAYTON (angrily) I didn't give any order to fire! 
ETHAN That's all right, Captain... I don't need any formal invitation to kill a Comanch... 
CLAYTON (grimly) You got one now! 
And he drops behind a rock as, with a wild whooping, the Comanche forces swing from their places of hiding and hit the river. The men open fire, all but Martin, who has frozen, staring wild-eyed at the oncoming Comanches. 
EXT. RIVER'S EDGE - PROFILE SHOT - THE DEFENDERS 
Brad, Charlie, Clayton, Nesby are snapping shot after shot. 
Only Martin seems out of it. Ethan shoots him a glance. 
ETHAN Slack your shoulders... Slack 'em... Your hands'll take care of themselves... 
Some of the tension leaves Martin. Somehow his gun is in position and he is firing as fast and well as the others. 
77-A 
EXT. THE RIVER - FULL SHOT - INDIAN CHARGE 
The Comanches are coming in, crouched low over their ponies' necks, whooping and firing. Men and horses go down, counted off by the expert marksmanship of the Texans. But they keep coming. 
The ANGLE is past some spectacular butte or citadel of rock into another long reach of valley -- different from the first view of it, yet alike in its suggestion of endlessness. 
But now there is no cloud of dust far away -- nothing to suggest the passage of anything but time itself. 
Ethan, Martin, and Brad ride into the fringe of the butte's shadow and scan the terrain ahead. 
BRAD (shrill) They got to stop sometime... if they're human at all, they got to stop! 
ETHAN Naw... a human man rides a horse till it dies... then he goes on afoot... A Comanche comes along... gets that horse up... and rides it twenty more miles... Then he eats it. 
Ethan turns to catch Martin thirstily drinking from his canteen. 
ETHAN (angrily) Easy on that! 
MARTIN Sorry... We don't even know if Debbie 'n Lucy are with this bunch... Maybe they split up... 
ETHAN They're with 'em -- if they're still alive. 
Brad wheels on him. 
BRAD You've said that enough!... Maybe Lucy's dead... maybe they're both dead... but if I hear it from you again, I'll fight ya, Mr. Edwards! 
ETHAN (an aside) That'll be the day!... Let's ride. 
WIPE TO: 
OMITTED 
89-A 
EXT. VALLEY AND CANYON WALL - WIDE ANGLE - THE RIDERS - 
LATE AFTERNOON 
(NOTE: This is the gap in the rocks near the "Medicine Country" at Monument.) 
The three riders come to where the trail they have been following forks... the main horseprint track leading ahead, a lesser track heading for a narrow gap between two buttes. 
MARTIN Four of 'em cut out here... Why? 
Ethan thinks he knows why. His face is bleak. But he tries to be casual. 
ETHAN I'll take a look... You keep after the others... 
He turns his mount toward the gap. 
MARTIN (eagerly) You want us to fire a shot if... 
ETHAN (disgustedly) No... nor build bonfires... nor beat drums neither. I'll meet you on the far side. 
He's still grumbling as he rides off. An abashed Martin rides ahead along the broad trail with Brad. 
(NOTE: Ethan's serape, tied behind his saddle, should be clearly seen as he rides away -- not pointed up, but visible.) 
WIPE TO: 
EXT. FAR SIDE OF BUTTE - TWILIGHT 
Martin and Brad, riding in a direction opposite to that in which they had taken off -- indicating their circle route -- haul up momentarily as they spot Ethan, standing beside his horse, his back to them, some distance along. They turn slightly off their course and ride out toward him. 
EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - NEAR BUTTE - TWILIGHT 
Ethan turns, almost startled, as the two youths ride in. 
His serape is no longer behind his saddle. Ethan looks at them blankly for a minute -- as though not really seeing them. 
ETHAN Oh... it's you. 
They both stare at him. 
ETHAN (a vague gesture) I... uh... here's where they met up again... 
They both can see that. 
ETHAN (pointing) Trail leads off there... 
They look at him and each other -- for these are clearly unnecessary remarks and doubly surprising coming from Ethan. 
BRAD Why'd they break off? (no answer) Was there water in that canyon? 
ETHAN Huh...?  No... no water. 
MARTIN You all right, Ethan? 
ETHAN Huh...? (more like his usual gruff self) Sure I'm all right... 
He goes to his horse, mounts. Martin is right beside him and he notes the missing serape. 
MARTIN Say!... What happened to your blanket? Lose it? 
ETHAN Must've... Anyway, I ain't goin' back to look for it... 
He leads out. Brad rides up beside Martin. Again the two exchange puzzled looks. Martin shrugs and the three continue along the broad trace of the Indian ponies into the setting sun. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. NIGHT CAMP - A POCKET IN THE HILLS - TWILIGHT 
Ethan crouches over a small fire built into a slit trench so that barely the glow of the flames can be seen. Beyond him Martin is leading their unsaddled horses away. The men have come to the end of another long day. Both men look up as Brad comes over a hill slope and rides recklessly down the incline to their camp. His horse is lathered. 
BRAD (shouting it) I saw her!... I saw Lucy! 
OMITTED 
EXT. PLAINS COUNTRY - LOW ANGLE SHOT - ETHAN AND MARTIN - 
AFTERNOON 
It is a portrait study of two faces -- etched by wind and privation and cold into tragic, fanatic masks. 
Martin has aged years in a matter of months. Falling snow flakes touch their faces and begin to rime their stubbly beards. 
MARTIN (bitterly) Say it. We're beat! 
ETHAN (slowly) No... our turnin' back don't change anything... not in the long run. If she's alive, she's safe... for a while... They'll keep her to raise as one of their own, 'til she's of an age to... 
He turns his mount. 
MARTIN And you think we got a chance to find her? 
ETHAN An Injun will chase a thing til he thinks he's chased it enough... Then he quits... Same when he runs... Seems he never learns there's such a thing as a critter that might just keep comin' on... So we'll find them in the end, I promise you that... We'll find them just as sure as the turning of the earth.

FADE IN 
EXT. THE JORGENSEN HOUSE AND APPROACH - WIDE ANGLE - 
TWILIGHT 
The time is spring. It is a year and a half later. 
The Jorgensen house is larger than the Edwards place -- of sod and logs, with a covered breezeway connecting the two separate buildings of the house: one being the keeping room, the other the sleeping quarters of the numerous Jorgensen brood. A meadowlark breaks into his sudden song. A dog or two come barking around the side of the house as Ethan and Martin ride slowly from behind CAMERA toward the house. In that instant a lamp is lighted within the house and Lars Jorgensen comes to the door. 
EXT. THE JORGENSEN HOUSE - FULL SHOT - NEAR DOOR - TWILIGHT 
Jorgensen peers at the two men as they ride up - recognizing them, of course, but ill-prepared for the change in their appearance and full of unspoken questions. 
Bearing a lamp, Mrs. Jorgensen hurries out to stand beside her husband -- and her face works and tears begin to well in her eyes. Two tow-headed boys -- 13 or 14 -- come after her. Jorgensen makes a little signal with one hand, not even looking at the boys, and they hurry out to take the reins as Ethan and Martin dismount. 
EXT. THE JORGENSEN HOUSE - MED. SHOT - ETHAN AND MARTIN 
The passage of time has stamped Martin -- and will continue during our story more and more to stamp him -- in the image of Ethan. Now it may show only in the set of his hat or trick of standing; later it will be in his walk, in his speech (or paucity of speech). Neither man is sure of his reception. They are thinking of Brad -- dead because of their search; and Martin is thinking of Laurie. And then Mrs. Jorgensen is running across to Martin and has him in her arms as though he were her son -- saying nothing, just holding him. He stands frozen a moment and then he returns the embrace. Ethan watches a moment, then crosses to Jorgensen. 
ETHAN (to Jorgensen) You got my letter about your son, Brad? 
JORGENSEN Yah... Just about this time a year ago... 
MRS. JORGENSEN It came the day before his... birthday. 
JORGENSEN The Lord giveth--the Lord taketh away... 
Mrs. Jorgensen starts to lead the way inside. Martin hangs back. 
MARTIN I ain't fit to go indoors, miz Jorgensen... These clothes is... 
Laurie rushes past her mother. 
LAURIE Martie! 
She kisses him hard and full on the mouth -- and has no eyes for anyone else. Mrs. Jorgensen looks on with amusement. Martin is just bowled over. 
MRS. JORGENSEN (teasing) And him probably forgettin' all about you!... Probably can't even call your name to mind. 
MARTIN (smiling) Laurie. 
And Laurie smiles triumphantly at her mother. 
MARTIN (continuing) But I fairly forgot just how pretty you was... 
Laurie grabs his hand then and pulls him indoors -- and there is no further resistance from Martin. 
Mrs. Jorgensen and her husband converge then on Ethan -- and her face is gravely questioning. 
MRS. JORGENSEN The little one?... Debbie? 
Ethan shakes his head. She squeezes his arm reassuringly and they start indoors. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. THE SPARE BEDROOM OF THE JORGENSEN'S - MED. SHOT - 
MARTIN - NIGHT 
This is a room off the kitchen end of the keeping room -- 
and described in the book as the "grandmother room": with narrow, slit-like windows, a set of single bunk beds, possibly a fireplace. 
Martin is in a deep wooden tub, taking a hot bath, currying his back with a long-handled brush. Beyond him is the door. It opens and Martin turns casually -- and at once stops being casual as Laurie enters and purposefully crosses to a stool or bench on which his discarded clothing is scattered. 
MARTIN Hey... What you doin'...? 
She picks up the shirt, puts it over one arm; she reaches for his long-handled and ragged underwear, runs a fist through a hole in its seat, clucks and shreds it into rags. During this: 
MARTIN (a yelp) Don't go takin' that stuff... 
LAURIE Ain't worth the mendin'... 
She turns and looks at him, matter of fact. 
LAURIE What you gettin' red-in-the-face for?... I have brothers, haven't I? 
ETHAN Wouldn't surprise me if we didn't have a frost 'fore mornin'... Here... (he picks up a saddle and puts it close to fire) Whyn't you bed down closer to the fire, boy? 
Martin is a bit surprised as Ethan takes the blanket and spreads it near the saddle -- making the saddle serve as a pillow. Then Ethan tosses a few more heavy pieces of dry wood on the fire, making it blaze up. 
MARTIN Hey! What's the idea...? 
ETHAN Maybe I'm gettin' like Mose Harper -- my bones is cold tonight... 
He spreads his own blanket as Martin wraps into his bedroll, and when Martin turns, he casually arranges the blanket to suggest it is over the figure of a man. During this: 
MARTIN Funny... When we passed through Fort Wingate last winter, we didn't hear mention of any Nawyecky Comanche there... 
Ethan steps back -- and studies the "dummy." 
ETHAN Not so funny... if you recollect what 'Nawyecka' means... 
MARTIN What's that? 
Ethan studies Martin's back -- the light on him -- and looks around figuring the range of fire. 
ETHAN Sorta like 'roundabout' -- like a man says he's goin' one place when he means to go just the reverse... 
MARTIN (drowsily) Oh... 
ETHAN You all settled an' comfortable now? 
Martin just grunts and snugs deeper into his blanket. Ethan nods his satisfaction -- sure Martin isn't going to change positions. Then he takes off his hat and boots and uses them to complete the dummy. He picks up his rifle then and quietly walks out of the camp. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. HILLY COUNTRY - A RAVINE OR ARROYO - FULL SHOT - THREE MEN - NIGHT 
Three shadowy figures -- Futterman and his two henchmen -- are quietly dismounting, taking rifles from saddle scabbards. 
At a hand signal from Futterman, they quietly fan out afoot. 
EXT. NIGHT CAMP - MED. CLOSE SHOT - MARTIN 
still snug in his blankets, sound asleep; the fire burning a little lower but still shedding plenty of light on him. 
EXT. HILLY COUNTRY - FULL SHOT - FROM BEHIND FUTTERMAN AND HIS HENCHMEN 
At a crouch or crawling, the three worm their way among some rocks until they reach a slight rise looking down into the camp. Martin is asleep and next to him is Ethan's dummy, hat over its face, and the fire still burning. The two henchmen snake their rifles up to a firing position. A shot cracks... and one man is knocked flat on his face. 
The other whirls in the direction of the shot, his rifle swinging in search of a target. A second shot splits the night and the breed falls as though hit by a giant fist... 
Martin is sitting up now, staring wildly around. Futterman starts to run down-slope, away from the hidden marksman, dodging between the rocks. A third shot catches him in the back and he spins and falls and rolls down the slope into the firepit camp area. Martin is on his feet now. 
EXT. NIGHT CAMP - FULL SHOT - MARTIN 
He is staring at Futterman, face down and almost at his feet. He looks around in fear at someone approaching -- hand going to his gun. Then he relaxes as Ethan casually enters the camp, bareheaded, carrying his rifle. 
ETHAN Thanks... you did just fine... 
Ethan kneels beside Futterman, turns him over, reaches into his pockets -- first one, then another. 
MARTIN (dazed) Futterman? 
ETHAN He just couldn't wait... 
MARTIN (watching him go through pockets) Whatchu doin'?... 
Ethan grins satisfiedly as he straightens and spins the gold piece in the air, catches it and pockets it. 
ETHAN Even got my twenty dollars back... We did all right. 
And now Martin is getting the whole picture... and he's mad. 
MARTIN WE?... You just used me for bait -- staked me out like a... buildin' up the fire... fixin' it so's... I coulda had my brains blowed out! 
Ethan is just grinning at him -- completely unruffled, denying none of it. 
MARTIN (explosively) Suppose you'd missed! 
Ethan sobers a little, seems honestly surprised. 
ETHAN Never occurred to me... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. THE JORGENSEN HOME - WIDE ANGLE - DAY 
It is a day in early winter. Charlie MacCorry, short-coated, is galloping across the yard as Jorgensen crosses it -- carrying a load of firewood. 
CHARLIE (calling it) Howdy, Mister Jorgensen... 
JORGENSEN Charlie... 
MacCorry swings off his saddle near the porch, as the door opens and Mrs. Jorgensen comes out -- shawled against the cold. 
CHARLIE Got a letter here... 
Jorgensen lets the cordwood drop... 
JORGENSEN By golly! A letter? 
CHARLIE For Miss Laurie... 
MRS. JORGENSEN Come in, Charlie, come in... (calling inside) LAURIE!... My land!... Two letters in the one year!... 
INT. JORGENSEN KEEPING ROOM - FULL SHOT 
reading the letter. She is at the bottom of a page. 
LAURIE 'There is one other thing I got to tell you before you hear it from Ethan... How I got myself a wife'... 
She stops and stares. 
LAURIE A WIFE? 
She looks at them - dazed. 
CHARLIE (delightedly) He did? 
JORGENSEN (smacking his knee -- very happy indeed) Good! A young man should get married early in life. Right, mama? 
Mrs. Jorgensen, full of sympathy for Laurie, just glares at her husband. 
JORGENSEN Every young man should at least once...Go on, Laurie! Read! 
LAURIE (haltingly) A little Comanche squaw - SQUAW! 
And with that she crumples the letter and throws it into the fire. 
MRS. JORGENSEN (aghast) Laurie! 
Jorgensen is out of his chair and scrambling in the fireplace to recover the letter. He fetches it out, beating the sparks out. The letter is basically undamaged. 
JORGENSEN (sternly) Is no way to treat a letter, Laurie ...Mama maybe you better read it... (to Charlie, proudly) My wife was a school teacher, Charlie ...She reads good. 
Laurie snatches the letter back. 
LAURIE I'll read it... 
Charlie crosses the room, picks up a guitar. 
CHARLIE (smugly) So he married a Comanche squaw... Haw haw haw! 
Laurie glares at him. He begins chording the guitar. 
WIPE TO: 
EXT. INDIAN ENCAMPMENT - MED. CLOSE SHOT - MARTIN AND "LOOK" - FALL OR EARLY WINTER - DAY 
"LOOK" is somewhat under five feet tall, pigeon-toed, platter- faced and wide-eyed. Over her arm is a very handsome blanket. She is coming forward shyly toward Martin, propelled by a Comanche -- her father. Martin, with an armful of trade goods -- a few yards of bright calico, a couple of AGED SOW rosettes and some trinkets -- is indicating the blanket. Look glances shyly at her father. 
He shakes his head negatively. Look is disappointed. 
The father points to Martin's pile of trade goods. Martin bends and picks up the indicated object: it is a battered high-crowned beaver hat. The Indian grunts his approval and puts it on. Look looks relieved. Martin reaches for the blanket. Look takes a quick step backward and holds up one finger: wait! Then she runs back through the other Comanches now crowding forward. 
EXT. INDIAN ENCAMPMENT - ANOTHER ANGLE - FULL SHOT - INCLUDING ETHAN 
who rides in slowly, leading their pack horse and Martin's horse. 
ETHAN (quietly) Let's go... I think I stumbled onto somethin'... 
MARTIN (eagerly) Scar? 
The name registers with some of the nearer braves. There is a quick interchange of glances, frowning, hostile. 
ETHAN (angrily) When are you goin' to learn to keep your mouth shut! Come on.  Let's get out of here. 
MARTIN But I just bought a good blanket. 
ETHAN (curtly) Forget it... 
Martin mounts and the two ride out. The Comanches stare after them suspiciously, resentfully. 
EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - FULL SHOT - ETHAN AND MARTIN - MOVING SHOT - EARLY WINTER DAY 
They are riding down a slight grade beyond which (we can assume) is the Comanche camp. 
ETHAN What I heard back there was that a band o' hostile Nawyeckas came through this way less'n two weeks ago... 
MARTIN (excitedly) Think it might be...? 
He breaks and both turn as Look rides over the hill on a little spotted Indian pony, with her squaw-bag slung up behind her and her blanket over the saddle. She closes the gap between them. 
ETHAN What's she followin' for? 
Look smiles shyly at Martin. 
MARTIN Look, I changed my mind... You can keep your blanket. 
He gestures for her to go back. 
MARTIN Go on back... 
She stares and then dutifully wheels her horse. Martin and Ethan face front again. Look wheels her horse again and is right with them. Martin stops - exasperated. 
MARTIN Look... you don't understand... (he waves her away) I don't want it. 
Look just sits. 
ETHAN (explosively) YOU don't understand, ya chunkhead! You didn't buy any blanket! Ya bought her! 
MARTIN (aghast) What? 
ETHAN You got yourself a wife, sonny! 
MARTIN (a wail) Oh no! Tell her she's got to go back... 
ETHAN And have her whole family after our scalps for floutin' one o' their women?... No sir! Come on, Mrs. Pauley... 
INT. JORGENSEN HOME - GROUP AS BEFORE - LAURIE READING - DAY 
Mrs. Jorgensen is bringing a lighted lamp over to the table where Laurie is reading against the fading light of day. Jorgensen's pipe has gone out and he lights it. 
LAURIE Maybe she left other signs for us to follow but we'll never know -- 'cause it snowed all day and all the next week... We were heading north, through the buffalo country when something happened that I ain't got straight in my own mind yet... (her voice fades) 
137-A 
EXT. SNOW COUNTRY - WIDE ANGLE SHOT - TWO RIDERS (COLORADO FOOTAGE) 
The two men are picking their way through a snow-mantled grove. Martin's voice resumes the narration. 
MARTIN'S VOICE Ethan's always been throwing it up to me that I'm a quarter-breed... I never figgered it made much difference... 
137-B 
EXT. BUFFALO HERD - WIDE ANGLE SHOT - DAY (COLO. FOOTAGE) 
MARTIN'S VOICE But this day we came on a small herd. We needed some meat so we circled 'round... 
137-C 
EXT. THE HERD - ANOTHER ANGLE (COLO. FOOTAGE) 
MARTIN'S VOICE ...and came up on 'em afoot...  They hadn't been hunted, so it was no trick workin' in close. 
137-D 
EXT. THE HERD - MARTIN AND ETHAN - DAY (COLO. FOOTAGE) 
The two men walk from behind CAMERA. Ethan aims, fires and brings down a bull. 
MARTIN'S VOICE Ethan got a nice one on his first shot, but then he began killing one after another -- cows as well as bulls -- fast as he could fire and load... It was just a slaughter... no sense to it... 
137-E 
EXT. THE HERD BEGINNING TO RUN (COLO. FOOTAGE) 
Shots cracking out -- the terrified bawling of the bulls -- the beginning of the stampede. 
137-F 
EXT. MED. CLOSE SHOT - ETHAN AND MARTIN (PROCESS) 
Martin strides across to where Ethan is firing. 
MARTIN Ethan, quit it! 
ETHAN (firing again) Nine... (another shot) Ten! 
MARTIN What's the sense in it! 
Ethan turns and swings a backhand blow which catches Martin by surprise and fells him. 
ETHAN (in a fury) Hunger! -- Empty bellies! That's the sense in it, you Cherokee!... 
He swings up his gun and fires again -- and again... as Martin stares at him from the ground. 
137-G 
EXT. THE HERD - LONG SHOT - THE STAMPEDE (COLO. FOOTAGE) 
Fear-maddened animals are swinging into full stampede fleeing the deadly marksman. Rifle shots keep cracking out. 
137-H 
EXT. MED. CLOSE SHOT - ETHAN AND MARTIN AS BEFORE (PROCESS) 
The thunder of the hooves is receding and Ethan grimly lowers his rifle. Martin picks himself up -- still staring at Ethan as though at a madman. Ethan turns and looks at him. 
ETHAN Least, THEY won't feed any Comanches this winter... Killin' buffalo's as good as killin' Injuns in this country. 
MARTIN Peaceful tribes depend on the buffalo, too.... 
ETHAN Ain't that too bad... If you feel that sorry for your kinfolk, I'm surprised you didn't take up with that squaw wife of yours... 
He whips out his shinning knife and strides toward the dead buffalo o.s. Martin looks after him with troubled expression. Suddenly he hears something, borne faint by the wind. 
MARTIN ETHAN! 
Ethan turns. Now faintly, little more than a shred of sound, is the distant blowing of a bugle. 
MARTIN Listen!... Hear it?... There! Ain't that a bugle... and firing? 
Ethan stares -- and then the bugle sound repeats and the distant crack of shots, from long miles off. 
ETHAN (grimly) Just hope we ain't too late... 
And the two break and run for their horses. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
OMITTED 
EXT. A RIVER - WIDE ANGLE - CAVALRY CROSSING WITH PRISONERS - DAY 
MARTIN'S VOICE (as narrator) It was all over long before we got there and the soldiers was high- tailin' it back to the agency with their prisoners -- squaws mostly -- by the time Ethan and me reached the camp... 
EXT. SNOW SLOPE - WIDE ANGLE - ETHAN AND MARTIN 
Horses and riders plunge downslope through breast-high snow. 
ETHAN That camp you hit was Nawyecka Comanche... Chief Scar's bunch... 
CORRESPONDENT (fascinated) Scar? What a wonderful name!... 
GENERAL (to his aide) Are you getting this, Keefer? 
CORRESPONDENT (to Ethan) How do you spell that word -- Nawyecka? 
Ethan ignores him, still facing the General. 
ETHAN My name's Edwards... I'm looking for my niece... she was in that camp when you attacked... 
GENERAL (uncertain) Well... I know there were some captives recovered... 
MARTIN (bitterly) Four of 'em dead... so we were told... 
GENERAL (uncomfortably) Unfortunately, the hostiles murdered them as we developed the village... 
ETHAN Are you sure they didn't die of carbine shots fired by a bunch o' Yank bluebellies so scared they couldn't tell the difference between a Cheyenne and a Comanche? 
GENERAL Keefer!... Put this man under arrest! 
ETHAN That'll be the day... (scornfully) 'As we developed the village'... Next time you develop a village, hit it where the fightin' men are... You won't get any headlines for killin' squaws. 
Keefer coughs. 
KEEFER Shall I show him the captives, sir? 
GENERAL Just get him out of here! 
KEEFER Yes sir... (he crosses to Ethan) This way... 
INT. THE CHAPEL - MED. CLOSE SHOT - ANGLING TO DOOR - AFTERNOON 
The door is opened by a guard and Ethan takes a step into the room -- then stops in manifest shock. Martin 
is at his heels, eager and expectant. Beyond them stands Keefer, grave and compassionate. There is a keening sound in the room -- almost an animal sound. 
INT. THE CHAPEL - REVERSE SHOT - FULL 
It is a simple log-sided room with plank benches without backs. Up front is a small box-like pulpit, no altar. 
Across the front of the room, set up either on benches or on boards over saw-horses are four blanket-covered figures -- at least two being the bodies of children. 
Squatting on the floor near them is an elderly white woman with hair hanging loosely down her back and clad in Indian robes. Standing, facing the newcomers, is a woman who may be no more than in her mid-thirties. 
She is mad -- wild-eyed, frightened, with matted, unbrushed golden hair, torn garments. It is she who has been making the keening sound, the animal moans. Now she crouches at the sight of them and looks desperately for a means of escape. Two girls are asleep, heads together and backs to the door. One has light hair, like Debbie's; the other brown hair. The afternoon sun coming through a high window touches the light hair. 
MARTIN Debbie?... DEBBIE? 
He has seen the light hair and starts crossing the room. 
Now the madwoman begins her screaming, running from side to side like a trapped animal. Ethan follows Martin into the room, Keefer behind him. Martin comes to a stop, realizing the woman is afraid of him. The two sleeping girls stir, but do not turn. 
MARTIN Don't be scared, ma'am... 
The madwoman crouches behind one of the benches, looking at them with frightened eyes. 
KEEFER Just don't pay any attention to her... 
Martin swallows and nods and crosses to the light-haired girl. He reaches a hand gingerly to touch her shoulder. 
MARTIN (softly) Debbie? 
At the touch, the girl is on her feet, crouching -- one hand, like a claw, drawn back to rake his face. She is unmistakably a white girl, but she is painted like a Comanche woman --her ears red inside, streaks of paint accenting the savagery of her face. Her eyes are frightened, yet full of hate. 
GIRL Pabo-taibo! (White man!) The other girl has risen almost in the same instant -- but more out of fear. She is younger, but painted like the other. She moves to stand behind the savage one. 
MARTIN (slowly) No... She's not... 
ETHAN I ain't sure... Where's that doll? 
Martin stares at him, then realizes what he has in mind. 
He fishes the rag doll from under his coat and holds it out to the girl. She looks at it... and we may almost suspect it is rekindling a memory -- but then she spits at it. The other girl laughs. Martin turns away and he's sick. 
KEEFER Was your niece about their age? 
ETHAN Not far from it... 
KEEFER Hard to realize they're white, isn't it... 
ETHAN (grimly) They're not white any more -- they're Comanche!... Let's see the bodies... 
Martin nerves himself for the ordeal, turns to follow. 
ETHAN I don't need you... 
Ethan and Keefer move away. As they do, the madwoman -- eyes fixed on the rag doll in Martin's hand -- begins creeping up behind him. Martin is torturedly watching Ethan and Keefer as first one blanket then another is raised -- we will never see the dead. During this: 
KEEFER (the dispassionate pro) I'd like you to see them all... It might help us identify them... Shot in the head -- flash-burn range... The boy got his skull cracked... Here's the girl... 
Martin stiffens, waiting. 
ETHAN No... 
Martin relaxes... and in that instant the madwoman has the doll in her hands. She cradles it and she croons. 
Martin reaches to take it away. But she calmly sits, cradling the doll, and rocks to and fro, humming a lullaby. He can't take it. Ethan returns. 
ETHAN Well, we only got the one lead -- Scar... And where we begin to look, I don't know... 
ETHAN Tequila... 
MARTIN Lo mismo. 
PROPRIETOR (beaming) Y' par' el Viejo -- el vino del pais... tequila tambien! 
Martin puts his back to the bar, leans elbows on it and looks around. 
158A 
INT. THE CANTINA - ANGLING PAST MARTIN TOWARD ESTRELLA 
She is giving him an appraising once-over, then signals the musicians to play. She rests her buttocks against a table and waits, her eyes challenging Martin to make a move. Emilio is watching Estrella and Martin with something akin to bored amusement. 
158B 
INT. THE CANTINA - ANGLE AT BAR 
Ethan has poured a drink for Mose, now one for himself -- leaving Martin's glass empty. 
MOSE I been helpin' ye, Ethan... I been lookin' all the time... 
Martin turns back to the bar to take his glass. He finds it empty. 
MARTIN (to Ethan's back) Thanks for nothin'... 
He angrily throws a coin on the counter, appropriates the bottle and his glass and heads for a table closer to Estrella. Neither Ethan nor Mose seems aware of his going. 
ETHAN Well, the reward still stands... 
MOSE Don't want no money, Ethan... jus' a place -- a roof over m' head... a little grub... a bunk to sleep in... an' a rockin' chair by the fire... my own rockin' chair by a fire... 
ETHAN You help me find her, you got your rockin' chair... 
MOSE Swear it, Ethan?... Given word? 
ETHAN (impatiently) Told ya, didn't I? 
MOSE (impressively) Ethan... I found a man's seen her... knows where little Debbie is! 
Ethan stares at him. Mose nods his reaffirmation of it. 
Then Ethan's hand locks on the old man's shoulder. 
ETHAN Who? Where is he... this man? 
Mose winces under the grip. He can't speak, but he looks past Ethan and he points. Ethan turns. Emilio swings his boots off the table and slowly crosses to them. He lets cigarette smoke curl out of his mouth. Then he smiles. 
EMILIO I am this man, senor... Emilio Gabriel Fernandez y Figueroa... at your service... (afterthought) ...for a price... (he smiles) ...Always for a price... 
As the men study each other, Estrella begins her dance -- and the rhythmic click of the castanets will beat like a metronome. Emilio looks at the bottle on the bar, disdainfully pushes it away and imperiously signals the proprietor to bring something better. 
EMILIO Un otra! 
INT. THE CANTINA - ANGLING PAST MARTIN TO ESTRELLA 
He is knocking off his tequila and looking at the girl hungrily. She is doing her swaying dance, playing up to him and with unmistakable effect. He sloshes another drink into his glass and, never taking his eyes off her, downs it. 
INT. THE CANTINA - FULL SHOT - ANOTHER ANGLE - THE DANCE 
Beyond Estrella we see Ethan, Emilio, and Mose at the bar -- gestures, headshakes, the entire pantomime of an inaudible conversation. Then Ethan takes out his pouch and begins dropping gold pieces into Emilio's hand. Meanwhile, dance and dancer are achieving their purpose with Martin. And the tequila is working. He gets to his feet, a little groggily. Estrella's smile deepens and there is a clear invitation in her eyes... Ethan turns then, his deal with Emilio concluded, and he sees what is going on. He starts for Martin's table just as Martin moves out to take the girl. 
ETHAN (tolerantly) Come on, Don Juan... We're on our way... 
Martin tries to push him away, his eyes still on the girl. 
MARTIN (thickly) Lemme alone... 
ETHAN (taking his arm) You breeds are all alike -- two drinks an'... 
Martin breaks free and squares off. 
MARTIN Take yer hands off'n me... This lady an' me got some things to talk over! 
Estrella ranges herself alongside of Martin and slips an arm possessively through his. 
ETHAN (a shrug) Suit yourself... While you're enjoyin' your little conversation, I'll be ridin' out with Senor Fernandez here...  The Comanch' medicine country ain't far... there's one camp with a chief named Cicatriz. 
MARTIN Never heard of him... 
ETHAN Cicatriz is Mex for Scar... an' he has a white girl in his tepee... Be seein' you... 
He turns and heads out. Emilio, who has come up behind him, gives Estrella a slight smile and bow. 
EMILIO Buena suerte, Estrella... Hasta la vista. 
He follows Ethan. Estrella swings her body close to Martin and lets her arms slide around his neck. 
ESTRELLA (softly) Tu quieres...? 
Martin blinks to clear away the fog of tequila and desire. 
MARTIN (a bitter laugh) Sure... sure... Only not this year... 
He pulls her arms away and goes lurching after the others. 
Mose catches his arm. 
MOSE 'Mind Ethan 'bout my rockin' chair! 
Martin continues out and Mose stands there -- his head rockin' as though he already were in his chair. 
INT. THE TEPEE - ANGLING PAST ETHAN TOWARD THE TWO YOUNG ONES 
ETHAN (glancing at them) Are those his wives too? 
One of the squaws turns -- and even in the shadows we see it is another Indian face. The other does not turn. 
Scar leans in, blocking the view. 
SCAR Two sons -- killed by white men... For each son, I take many scalps... (in Comanche) Mayah-kay zee-eh!... (Bring the lance!) 
The slightly smaller of the young squaws stiffens but doesn't move. Scar glares. 
SCAR (louder) MAYAH-KAY ZEE-EH! 
The girl gets to her feet. Ethan and Martin watch as, still with averted face, she crosses to where a lance hangs from the tepee wall. It has several scalps on it, including one with light red hair. Slowly she carries it back. Scar never takes his eyes from the faces of the white men, savoring every moment of it. The girl extends the lance between them, so that it is like a bare blade separating two duelists. Neither Ethan nor Martin dares at first look at more than the scalp pole... Then slowly their eyes lift... and the CAMERA MOVES IN and RAISES TO: 
INT. THE TEPEE - EXTREME CLOSE SHOT - DEBBIE 
As the shawl slips back to reveal her light hair, the slant green eyes looking at them from a tanned, but still white and very beautiful face. (NOTE TO MUSIC: The SEARCH THEME should cover all the foregoing action -- but at the first clear view of DEBBIE, it ends dramatically.) 
Debbie's eyes hold theirs -- and then Scar's voice is heard: 
SCAR (in Comanche) Pie-kay! (Go!) 
Swiftly she straightens, takes away the scalp pole and goes back to her former place. 
INT. THE TEPEE - MED. CLOSE SHOT - THE GROUP AS BEFORE 
Scar is watching the white men like a hawk. Martin's eyes are wide and his breathing seems suspended. But Ethan is playing it like a poker player. 
ETHAN (his voice controlled) I've seen scalps before... 
Scar's eyes are mocking. He lets his robe slip back from his shoulders, revealing a bare bronzed chest on which -- glinting in the reflected firelight -- is the medallion that Ethan had given Debbie. It is suspended by a chain or rawhide string. Scar touches it. 
SCAR This before? 
Ethan smiles -- and he's still playing poker. He stands... and the others follow. Scar is puzzled. 
ETHAN (to Emilio) I came to trade, not to admire his collection... Tell him we're going to pitch camp across the crick... Maybe we can talk trade tomorrow. 
Scar hasn't understood all of it. He scowls and looks at Emilio. 
SCAR (in Comanche) Ee-sap! Pabbo-tie-bo ee-sap! (He lies! The gringo lies!) 
EMILIO (placatingly) Tomorrow -- manana -- 'puetze.' 
Scar looks at Ethan and at Martin. He smiles slightly, and he nods his agreement. 
SCAR Puetze! 
Martin and Ethan turn to go. Only then does Debbie look swiftly at them and as swiftly away. Martin can't help but pause, but Ethan prods him toward the tepee flap. 
EXT. THE TEPEE - MED. CLOSE SHOT - MOVING - THE THREE MEN 
They emerge from the tepee and begin to walk away -- not fast, not slow, and without a side glance. Scar emerges and looks after them -- glowering. A few other Comanches begin to gather near his tepee. 
EMILIO (urgently) Walk with dignity! (after a moment; lips hardly moving) If you gringo heretics have any prayers, say them... 
MARTIN (transfigured) She's alive... Can you believe it, she's alive... alive... An' we found her... 
EMILIO (fervently) Please!... I, too, am alive... I wish to stay that way. 
They reach the waiting cargadores and the pack train, surrounded by suspicious Comanches. 
EMILIO (to his men) Vamanos! 
They mount and ride out. 
WIPE TO: 
EXT. SAND DUNES NEAR NEEDLES (MONUMENT) - FULL SHOT - LATE AFTERNOON 
Emilio is standing near his horse, talking to Ethan and Martin. 
EMILIO You understand, senores... It is not that I am cobarde... cowardly... 
ETHAN Don't apologize... You did your job... 
Emilio nods and mounts. 
EMILIO He knows you -- who you are -- and why you are here... This I did not understand... or I would not... even for gold, senores... have led you here. 
He fumbles for a pouch, holds it out to Ethan. 
EMILIO Take it. I do not want blood money. Vaya con Dios! 
He digs spurs and rides out. Ethan turns and looks soberly at Martin. We hear the rest of the riders moving away. 
Ethan and Martin cross the sand and go down slope toward the creek where their horses are waiting. 
174-A 
EXT. SAND CREEK (MONUMENT) - FULL SHOT - THE TWO - DAY 
MARTIN You figger Scar means to kill us? 
ETHAN He's got to... All these years, runnin', dodgin', knowin' we were after him... Now we caught up... It's him or us. 
MARTIN Why didn't he make his move back there? 
ETHAN I don't know... Somethin' tied his hands... maybe hospitality... 
EXT. THE CAVE (MONUMENT) - FULL SHOT - THE TWO - DAY 
Martin pulls his horse in and swings off just as Ethan slides from his saddle. He runs toward one of the huge boulders, crouches and starts firing. 
175-D 
EXT. CANYON COUNTRY - WIDE ANGLE ON THE COMANCHES - DAY 
The Comanches are spread out but coming on fast. One goes down under Martin's fire.... another is hit in the arm. He pulls up and the other Comanches wheel away from the hidden marksman. 
175-E 
EXT. THE CAVE - FULL SHOT - MARTIN AND ETHAN 
Martin runs back from his firing post toward where Ethan has fallen. 
ETHAN (angrily) Go on! Get out of here while you can... 
MARTIN (pointing to the cave) Over there! 
Ethan turns and sees what he means. He starts dragging himself to the cave as Martin grabs the rifles from their saddle scabbards, yanks off the water canteens and then drives their horses away. Then he too runs for the shelter of the cave. 
175-F 
EXT. THE CANYON - ANGLING FROM BEHIND MARTIN AND ETHAN 
Both men are crouching, rifles ready. In the distance we see their horses running off -- pursued by some yelling Comanches. Four or six others come into sight, heading for the cave -- moving cautiously, uncertainly -- not seeing their quarry. Then the white men open fire and the Comanches bend low over their horses' necks and clear out of there. Ethan looks grimly at Martin. 
ETHAN They'll be back... 
MARTIN We won't be here... Come on! 
He gets an arm under Ethan and hauls him to his feet. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
175-G 
EXT. THE GAP IN THE CLIFF - PANNING SHOT - SUNSET 
CAMERA PANS from the top of the rock chimney to where Martin is snaking his way through, carrying newly-filled water canteens. He stands there, listening and looking back the way he has come; and then, satisfied there has been no pursuit, he continues away. 
OMITTED 
INT. THE CAVE - MED. SHOT - ETHAN - HALF-LIGHT 
Ethan is lying on the hard earth, perhaps cushioned with some boughs. He is half delirious. A small fire is burning. 
Martin enters carrying the canteens. He looks unsympathetically toward Ethan, then continues to the fire, takes a knife and starts to sterilize it. Ethan gasps, mumbles and then a word comes clear. 
ETHAN Martha... Martha! 
Martin stares at him -- and now, perhaps for the first time, he is fitting pieces into the jig-saw puzzle. He shifts closer to Ethan and we see he is preparing to dig out the bullet. Ethan opens his eyes and looks at him. 
MARTIN I gotta open that leg and let the poison out... 
He poises the knife. 
ETHAN Wait... 
He fumbles in his shirt pocket, brings out a greasy folded piece of paper. 
ETHAN Just in case... Read it. 
Martin sets the knife down, takes the paper, opens it and slowly reads: 
MARTIN 'I, Ethan Edwards, being of sound mind and without any blood kin, do hereby bequeath all my property of any kind to Martin Pauley...' (he stares, then) I don't want your property.... 'Sides, what do you mean no 'blood kin?' Debbie's your blood kin... 
ETHAN Not no more. 
MARTIN (angrily) You can keep your will! (he thrusts it back into Ethan's shirt) I ain't forgettin' you was all set to shoot her yourself... What kind o' man are you, anyway. 
ETHAN (sitting up -- eyes blazing) She's been with the bucks! She's nothin' now but a... 
Martin shoves him back onto the ground. 
MARTIN (a shout) Shut your dirty mouth! 
He gets to his feet, trembling, and stands looking down at Ethan, his fists clenched at his sides and murder in his eyes. Then his eyes rove to the knife lying on the blanket. 
He picks it up and he looks again at the wounded man. 
MARTIN (slowly) I hope you die! 
And he kneels again to open the wound. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. DESERT COUNTRY - FULL SHOT - ETHAN AND MARTIN - DAY 
Martin is hauling an improvised travois over the ground in which, lashed by vines and some clothing, is the unconscious figure of Ethan. 
CLOSE SHOT - MOVING - MARTIN - DAY 
Eyes shadowed, whiskered, drawn -- he is an implacable figure as he drags the weary miles home. He hears a groan from Ethan o.s. He barely lets his eyes drift to the sound. He doesn't stop. 
CLOSE SHOT - MOVING - ETHAN IN THE TRAVOIS - DAY 
We see he is delirious, lips parched, strapped to the poles. 
The travois jolts over the ground. As he passes out of frame, the CAMERA HOLDS on the marks of the travois poles scraping across the desert. 
ETHAN (to all) Evenin'... evenin' Reverend... or do I call you 'Captain'...? 
CLAYTON Came here for a wedding, Ethan... Until that's over, I reckon 'reverend' will do... 
MRS. JORGENSEN (coming forward) And news of our little girl, Ethan? 
His face contorts and his smile is twisted. 
ETHAN She's not a little girl any more. 
MRS. JORGENSEN (eyes wide) You've seen her!... She's alive? 
ETHAN I've seen her... and she's alive. 
Mrs. Jorgensen throws herself against his chest, sobbing. 
Ethan looks past her at Clayton. And the faces of both men are grim. 
CUT TO: 
INT. THE GRANDMOTHER ROOM - FULL SHOT 
The room is dark. Martin is pacing, eyes constantly turning to the inside door. And then it opens and Laurie is inside, holding a lamp. She is in her bridal gown and very obviously trying to keep from betraying the stress she is under. 
LAURIE (quietly) Hello, Martie.... 
He just stares at her -- very lovely, strangely remote. 
He suddenly is conscious of his dirty hands, his dusty, worn clothing. 
MARTIN I... I wrote you a letter... Reckon you didn't get it... 
LAURIE (setting the lamp down) One letter in five years... I read it till the paper dried up and the writing faded out... 
MARTIN It wasn't much of a letter... 
LAURIE No, it wasn't... You mighta said you loved me... You mighta asked me to wait... At least that'd have been something... 
MARTIN But I allus loved you... You know that, without my sayin' it... I couldn't bring myself to ask you to wait... the little I had... not knowin' how much longer until we found Debbie... 
LAURIE (breaking) It isn't fair... 
She sinks onto the bench. 
LAURIE (sobbing) It isn't fair, Martin Pauley, and you know it! 
She begins to cry, very softly. He is beside her and his arm goes around her shoulder comfortingly. 
MARTIN Don't cry, Laurie... I understand how it is... I'll just go 'way... 
LAURIE (spinning on him) You do and I'll die, Martie... I will! I'll just die! 
And they are kissing through her tears when the outer door is flung open by Charlie MacCorry. They part as he glares. 
CHARLIE I'll thank you to leave the room, Laurie. 
Martin stares at him, then at her. 
MARTIN (incredulous) Charlie MacCorry!... You weren't fixin' to marry HIM?? 
CHARLIE She sure is!... An' don't think your comin' back is goin' to change it! 
MARTIN As to that, I don't know, Charlie... We hadn't got around to talkin' marriage... 
CHARLIE What right you got to be talkin' marriage to any decent woman... 
MARTIN (angrily) If you're talkin' about that crazy murder charge... 
CHARLIE AND other things... Mebbe you thought you was gettin' away with being comical about that Indian wife you took... I bet she wasn't the first squaw you... 
Martin swings wildly but Charlie is a wily fighter. He side- steps and chops Martin in the jaw and drives him against the wall. Laurie runs between them. 
LAURIE Stop it! Both of you... I won't have any fighting in this house. 
Martin gently brushes her aside. 
MARTIN It's all right... Charlie, let's move outside. 
CHARLIE I ain't wearing no gun. 
Martin nods and unbuckles his gunbelt. The men head outside as Laurie runs to get help. 
EXT. THE JORGENSEN HOME - BREEZEWAY 
Charlie waits assuredly as Martin follows him outside. 
Martin makes a wild run, swings. The blow is neatly guarded by Charlie's left and countered with a crisp right that puts Martin down. Martin gets to his feet, more cautiously this time, and comes in at a crouch; he's fighting like an Indian, not a white man. The men from the wedding party come out now at a run. 
CLAYTON (yelling) Sergeant MacCorry! 
Charlie turns slightly and in that instant Martin springs and drives a straight right at his face -- almost as though there were a knife in the hand. MacCorry stumbles back into Clayton's arms. 
CLAYTON Is this in the line of duty, sergeant? 
CHARLIE (regaining his balance) No sir... pleasure. 
CLAYTON In that case, give the boys room... 
Martin waits at a crouch as Charlie comes in, feints his right and crosses his left. It is a hard blow but Martin recovers and waits... Charlie circles and starts to repeat. He feints his right but this time Martin springs in, ducks and -- as the left shoots out -- he grabs the wrist and throws Charlie over his head. What we are looking at, in effect, is a wrestler against a boxer. 
CLAYTON Fight fair, son... Use your fists! 
LIEUTENANT That maybe he's not far from here -- holed up somewhere, waiting his chance to get back over the border... He raided north about a month ago... ran into more army than he bargained for... Now he's running for cover, for keeps this time... 
CLAYTON And what makes you think he's in this territory? 
LIEUTENANT Yesterday, one of our patrols picked up a man claims he was a prisoner with Scar till only two days ago... He talks crazy but I brought him along... Says he lives here... keeps mentioning a rocking chair. 
ETHAN (half to himself) Mose... 
And then he is striding to the door, calling it: 
ETHAN MOSE! 
MOSE'S VOICE Ay-he?... Ay-eh?... 
And the old man totters in, half-supported by a trooper -- hollow-eyed, weak, almost delirious. 
MOSE Come f'r my rockin' chai'... ole Mose. 
ETHAN (shouting it) Where's Scar, Mose... SCAR? 
MARTIN Ask him about Debbie!... Is she all right, Mose? 
MOSE My rockin' chai'... 
MRS. JORGENSEN (bustling over) Leave the poor man be! Can't you see he's out of his mind... 
She tries to lead him away, but Ethan shoves her aside and grips the old man by his arms. 
ETHAN Mose... try to remember!... You were in Scar's camp... 
MOSE Ay-he... Made out I was crazy... (he giggles foolishly) Ate dirt... chewed grass... I fooled 'em, Ethan!... an' I got away... 
ETHAN Scar! Where's he holed in? 
MOSE Seven Fingers... ay-he... Seven... 
He staggers and this time Mrs. Jorgensen won't be denied. 
MRS. JORGENSEN Now that's enough!  Here... by the fire... What you need's a good bowl of soup... 
She leads him away, at last to his rocker by the fire. 
During this, Ethan and Clayton have been mulling Mose's answer. 
ETHAN (blankly) Seven Fingers? 
LIEUTENANT That's what he told us... but there's no such place on the maps. 
MARTIN Wait a minute! Isn't that the Caddo name for where all those canyons branch on the Malapai? 
MOSE (from his rocker) Caddo or Kiowa... ay-he... ay-eh... 
Sam Clayton wheels on the Lieutenant. 
CLAYTON You tell your pa a company of Rangers -- all fourteen of 'em -- fully armed an' equipped will be in the field by daylight... headin' for the south end of the Malapai. If he can catch up with us, well an' good... 
LIEUTENANT But... but captain, we can't possibly take the field tomorrow... for your own protection... 
CLAYTON Sonny, yonder's a passel of murderers, complete with Texican scalps an' white girl captive... You want to protect us, you just get out of our way... Now skedaddle! 
The lieutenant skedaddles. Sam whirls on Martin and Ethan. 
CLAYTON Ethan, you an' Martin are hereby appointed civilian scouts -- without pay... Charlie, hightail it to headquarters an' spread the word... 
CHARLIE Yes sir... 
He leaves. Martin's hands go to his side -- recalling where he left his guns. 
MARTIN My guns... 
He heads for the inner door to the grandmother room. 
INT. THE GRANDMOTHER ROOM - FULL SHOT 
as Martin enters and crosses to where he had dropped his gunbelt. Even before he reaches it, Laurie is in the room -- closing the door after her. 
LAURIE Martie... don't go! Not this time. 
MARTIN (staring) You crazy? 
LAURIE It's too late... She's a woman grown now... 
MARTIN I got to fetch her home... 
LAURIE Fetch what home?... The leavin's of Comanche bucks -- sold time an' again to the highest bidder?... With savage brats of her own, most like?... 
MARTIN (shouting it) Laurie! Shut your mouth! 
LAURIE Do you know what Ethan will do if he has a chance?... He'll put a bullet in her brain! And I tell you Martha would want him to! 
MARTIN Only if I'm dead! 
He strides out past her. 
INT. THE KEEPING ROOM - FULL SHOT 
as Martin re-enters. Ethan and Sam are waiting. Martin looks hard at Ethan. 
CLAYTON You ready? 
MARTIN (eyes never leaving Ethan's face) I'm ready. 
GREENHILL (calling -- still distant) Captain Clayton... Captain! 
Sam whips off his hat and makes frantic signals to Greenhill to shut up. Greenhill pulls to a canter, puzzled, and rides in. 
CLAYTON (exploding) Go on! Whyn't you have your bugler sound the charge while you're at it?? 
GREENHILL (blankly) Sir? 
CLAYTON Never mind... Your pa know you're out here? 
GREENHILL Yes, sir... Troop's about ten miles back... The Colonel sent me looking for you... 
CLAYTON (dismissing him) Well you found me... Good work, son... Good work. 
He starts away. Greenhill follows. 
GREENHILL If there's anything I can do, sir... 
CLAYTON (under his breath) God forbid... No, son, you flog on back and tell your pa where we're at... and where he's at... 
GREENHILL But he knows THAT, sir... Can't I stay, sir? 
CLAYTON (reluctantly) All right... But keep your eye on me, boy... I'm the hard case you're up against here -- not these childish savages... If you don't hear me first time I holler, you better read my mind... I don't aim to raise no two hollers on any subject at hand... 
GREENHILL Yes, sir... 
He whips out his sabre -- to the imminent peril of Captain Sam who quickly shifts out of the way. 
CLAYTON Watch that knife, boy! 
Then Sam continues away and the Rangers after him. 
EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF COMANCHE CAMP - FULL SHOT - DAWN LIGHT 
Martin runs from behind CAMERA and dodges behind a rock. The camp is still asleep, very quiet. Martin runs out from behind the rock and makes another short dash toward the camp, dropping behind a pile of blankets or other impedimenta. A dog runs out of one of the tepees, begins barking. 
EXT. THE HORSE HERD - MED. CLOSE SHOT - SCAR 
He stands with another Comanche -- inspecting the horse lines. In the near distance the dog's barking is heard -- shrill, insistent. Scar, almost like an animal, sniffs the air suspiciously. The other Comanche laughs. 
COMANCHE Tahbo. (A rabbit.) 
Scar isn't satisfied but returns to his work. 
EXT. THE COMANCHE CAMP - ANGLE FAVORING SCAR'S TEPEE PAST MARTIN 
He is staring at it -- remembering it from certain distinct decorations. The lower part of the tepee is rolled up, for better air circulation. Martin wraps Charlie's blanket around him and begins walking to the tepee. 
EXT. THE LEE OF THE HOGBACK OR RISE - FULL SHOT - THE RANGERS 
The line is drawn up, dismounted, the men checking their sidearms, tightening cinches, etc. Sam moves briskly along the line of men, then mounts his horse. 
CLAYTON The State of Texas is payin' you boys $12 a month. Here's your chance to earn it... Now I don't want any foolin' around after scalps. We ain't got the time... Yankee cavalry's on its way here to set those Comanches free... We gotta beat 'em to it -- our way... Now mount an' guide center on young Greenhill here. Son, you just follow me... And WATCH THAT KNIFE! 
The last comes as Greenhill tries to mount, simultaneously flailing out his sabre perilously close to Clayton. 
EXT. SCAR'S TEPEE - MED. CLOSE SHOT - MARTIN 
Martin has gained the tepee, takes one quick look around, then strides in. 
INT. SCAR'S TEPEE 
as Martin enters. One robe, tossed back, shows where Scar has slept. Against one wall lie the huddled figures of two squaws. Two other figures -- one being Debbie's -- sleep in robes. Martin's eyes go to Scar's place and then rove slowly and hold on: 
INT. TEPEE - MED. CLOSE SHOT - DEBBIE 
She moves slightly so that the light strikes her fair hair. Martin kneels close to her and gently touches her shoulder, to awaken her. Her eyes open, then widen in fear. Martin quickly claps a hand over his mouth. 
Silently she fights him, trying to pull the hand away. 
MARTIN (a hoarse whisper) Debbie... don't! 
And then her fingernails rake his hand. He winces and lets go. She screams and tries to leap up. He grabs her. The other squaws wake -- begin squawking. 
MARTIN (grimly) I'm takin' you whether you want to or not... 
Debbie sees something beyond him. Her eyes widen. 
DEBBIE (a scream) MARTIN! 
INT. TEPEE - SHOOTING FROM EXTREME LOW ANGLE, AS FROM HER P.O.V. - SCAR 
He looms in the flap of the tepee much as he had over the grave when he first kidnapped her. He has a scalping knife in his hand. Scar whips his arm back. Behind him we see the other Comanche -- the one from the horse herd. 
INT. TEPEE - FULL SHOT 
Martin spins and his gun is out. He fans the trigger hammer twice -- and both slugs hit Scar. As the other Comanche leaps in, Martin's gun speaks again. And then he is on his feet, catching Debbie by the arm -- unresisting now -- and pulling her after him through the camp. Shouts and cries bespeak the awakening of the camp. 
EXT. THE HOGBACK - FULL SHOT - THE RANGER GROUP 
They are mounted and in line. The echo of a shot comes bouncing back. Clayton is facing the men. He solemnly doffs his hat and bows his head. 
CLAYTON For these Thy gifts which we are about to receive... (donning his hat, he turns to the bugler) Sound that horn, son, and Leave Us Go Amongst Them...YA-HEE! 
And shouting the rebel yell, he leads the charge. The yell is picked up by every man and the bugler sounds the charge as though he had a regiment at his back. Lt. Greenhill -- a West Point beau sabreur in strange company -- has his sabre at the "charge." 
FULL MOVING SHOT - ON THE CHARGE 
In the swamp of men and horses, we just have time to notice that Sam is darting a somewhat worried look at Greenhill's saber ominously close to his back. The charge is sounding, the hooves are drumming and the men are yelling the way they did when they rode with Bedford Forrest -- reins in their teeth, guns in their fists. 
EXT. THE ENCAMPMENT - FULL SHOT - AS THE RANGERS HIT

Sleepy Hollow 
Being the true storie of one Ichabod Crane and the Headless Horseman 
Kevin Yagher and Andrew Kevin Walker 
Based on "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" by Washington Irving 
Screenplay by Andrew Kevin Walker 
Third Draft 
A pleasing land of drowsy head it was, of dreams that wave before the half shut eye... 
EXT.  GNARLED FOREST -- NIGHT 
An UGLY MAN charges through on a horse, holding a lantern forward on a long pole. He looks back, terrified. 
INSERT TITLE:  1799 Sleepy Hollow, New York 
THUNDEROUS HOOFBEATS are HEARD behind. 
The ugly man glances back again.  His lantern swings wild... SHATTERS against a tree.  The jammed-up pole SLAMS the ugly man off his horse... 
He hits the ground.  He runs, trips, falls and scrambles up. 
DEEP IN THE FOREST, we glimpse the source of the HOOFBEATS: a HUGE FORM on a HUGE BLACK HORSE, already gone. 
The ugly man pushes through thorny bushes.  Jagged branches slit his hands and cheeks. 
He bursts from the briar patch and tumbles to a trail.  He lifts his bloodied face.  He runs. 
IN THE FOREST BEHIND: the hooves of the black horse rip underbrush.  HOOFBEATS DEAFENING.  A spur digs into the snorting steed's already bleeding flank. 
The pursuer's gloved hand draws a SWORD, blade RINGING. 
ON THE TRAIL, the ugly man runs on.  The shrill WHISTLE of a SWORD SWING is HEARD as the pursuer blurs past. 
The ugly man is still running when his head lolls back, at an impossible angle... tumbles off his shoulders... His headless body hits the dirt. 
EXT.  CITY STREETS -- NIGHT 
Empty cobblestone streets.  Crooked buildings.  A RAPIDLY CLANGING BELL breaks the silence from afar. 
INSERT TITLE:  New York City 
TWO CONSTABLES clamor round a corner, lanterns held high, listening.  They rush into an alleyway. 
ELSEWHERE, piers border the Hudson River.  The BELL is LOUDER. The two constables arrive, searching.  No one around. Constable One hefts his pistol, scared. 
CONSTABLE ONE Where are you?! 
MAN'S VOICE (o.s.) Here!  Over here! 
They hurry to the river's edge.  Down a hill, the MAN, another constable, stands with his back to us.  He's waist deep in water, tossing away his ALARM BELL. 
MAN I need your help with this. 
Constable Two crosses on the peir above.  Constable One moves forward, wary.  The MAN grunts, lifting something. 
CONSTABLE ONE Constable Crane?  Ichabod Crane... is that you? 
The MAN turns.  Meet ICHABOD CRANE, handsome, eyes piercing. 
ICHABOD Yes, it is me.  But, not only me... (lifting, struggling) I found someone here... 
He drags a bloated MALE CORPSE up from the murky water. 
ICHABOD Someone quite dead. 
EXT.  WATCHHOUSE/JAIL -- NIGHT 
The elderly HIGH CONSTABLE lifts a blanket off the corpse on a wheelbarrow manned by Constable Two.  A snobby MAGISTRATE looks, disgusted.  Constable One and Ichabod wait. 
HIGH CONSTABLE Burn it. 
CONSTABLE ONE Yes, sir. 
Constable Two wheels the corpse inside.  Ichabod's dismayed. 
ICHABOD Just a moment... if I may.  It is possible this man was murdered. 
HIGH CONSTABLE He drowned.  Anyone could see. 
ICHABOD There are surgical ways of telling how he died... by the water in his lungs... 
Ichabod follows the High Constable and Magistrate in. 
INT.  WATCHHOUSE, NIGHT WATCH QUARTERS -- NIGHT 
Constable Two wheels the body ahead past many "booking" tables.  A JAILER moves to unlock a massive door. 
HIGH CONSTABLE He will be burned pursuant to statutes of health. 
ICHABOD I could determine if he were dead before he went into the Hudson. 
HIGH CONSTABLE Must we again hear these heretical rantings? 
MAGISTRATE Yes, must we? 
Ichabod ponders this as he continues.  Ahead on a hill: the grand Van Tassel Manor House. 
INT.  VAN TASSEL MANOR HOUSE, SITTING ROOM -- DAY 
MANY CHILDREN, in a circle, taunt a BLINDFOLDED YOUNG WOMAN spun round by the handsome, barrel-chested man, BROM VAN BRUNT.  A few YOUNG MEN and LADIES watch.  Brom releases the woman.  Everyone quiets and avoids her searching hands. 
BLINDFOLDED WOMAN This is such a silly game. 
BROM Be a sport and stop complaining. 
The woman moves to Brom's voice.  He backs away, flanked by peers GLENN and THEODORE.  Children laugh. 
Ichabod enters, clearing his throat.  No one notices.  The blindfolded woman keeps grasping.  One LITTLE GIRL sees Ichabod and goes to him, finger to her lips. 
LITTLE GIRL Play along.  You must. 
She tugs him.  Before Ichabod can protest, he is placed in the blindfolded woman's grip. 
BLINDFOLDED WOMAN There, I have someone.  Am I finished? 
LITTLE GIRL You have to tell who it is. 
The woman touches Ichabod's face.  He is uncomfortable, affected by this caress.  Brom watches jealously. 
LITTLE GIRL At least make a guess. 
BLINDFOLDED WOMAN I don't know.  Is it Brom Bones? 
BROM Certainly not. 
ICHABOD Excuse me, Miss... (takes her hands) They have a laugh at your expense. 
She takes the kerchief off to reveal a stunning beauty: KATRINA VAN TASSEL.  Ichabod tries to compose himself. 
KATRINA Forgive me, I didn't know. 
ICHABOD I... I am looking for Baltus Van Tassel. 
BROM We haven't heard your name yet, friend. 
ICHABOD Well, unless your name is Baltus, you should not worry over mine. 
Brom grabs Ichabod's collar, pissed.  Ichabod's baffled. 
BROM You need some manners. 
KATRINA Brom! 
Brom looks at her, then reluctantly releases Ichabod. 
MAN'S VOICE (o.s.) What is this, then... ? 
BALTUS VAN TASSEL, 45, has entered, a working-class aristocrat.  LADY VAN TASSEL, 40, stands behind, a mix of home-spun wife and well-kept lady. 
BALTUS Can I help you, sir? 
Ichabod's relieved to have a proper focal point.  Children gather around Katrina and hide behind her. 
ICHABOD I have been sent from the city with a letter of introduction. I am told you offer me room and board. 
Ichabod hands over papers.  Baltus reads, furrows his brow. 
ICHABOD If we could speak alone. 
BALTUS (nods, looks to Katrina) This is not a time for frivolity, Katrina, is it?  Am I mistaken? 
KATRINA They're only children, father. 
Baltus snorts, then exits with Ichabod.  The others huddle to gossip, except Katrina, who moves beside Lady Van Tassel to watch Ichabod and Baltus walk down the hall. 
INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, PARLOR -- DAY 
DOCTOR LANCASTER, 50, dour and always sweaty, takes a seat by the fire, joining Baltus and three other elders.  A pretty servant, SARAH, brings a pipe cradle while Lady Van Tassel sets down food.  Ichabod is standing. 
BALTUS That will be all, ladies. (waits as they exit) We are joined by Doctor Thomas Lancaster, Constable.  And to his left are, Clergyman Steenwyck and our able magistrate, Samuel Philipse, both keeping order in their own ways. 
PHILIPSE is youngest, eyes bloodshot, mug in hand and pipe in mouth.  CLERGYMAN STEENWYCK is formidably built, wearing a constant look of disapproval. 
BALTUS I myself am in charge of financial matters and the regulation of currency in our commonwealth.  And, lastly, this fine fellow is James Hardenbrook, our Notary. 
HARDENBROOK is oldest, ancient, with one eye pale and blind. 
ICHABOD An honor, gentlemen.  In time I will need every detail of the three murderings you've had, but, for now, I ask only if you have any theory at all as to who the killer might be? 
DOCTOR LANCASTER Excuse me? 
ICHABOD I say, is there any one person suspect in these acts? 
DOCTOR LANCASTER I was afraid of this. 
Philipse shoots a look to Baltus.  Angst amongst the elders. 
PHILIPSE Well, Constable... are you aware... to be honest, you are not what we expected.  We sent for the militia. 
ICHABOD The militia? 
FATHER STEENWYCK Why not tell us what you have heard? Hmm?  How much have your superiors bothered to tell you? 
ICHABOD All I know is three are slain, their heads found severed from their bodies... 
FATHER STEENWYCK The heads were not found severed. The heads were not found at all. 
PHILIPSE Someone leave him a horse. 
Young Masbath watches his father go.  Brom coaxes him away. At the back of the crowd, Ichabod watches skeptically, looks to Young Masbath as he and Brom pass. 
ICHABOD You worry for naught, little man. Nothing will harm him there. (looks up, sotto) It is problems here on the ground you people need begin to worry about. 
Ichabod watches Jonathan climb, very high above. 
INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT 
Ichabod makes notations in a LEDGER BOOK. 
KATRINA (v.o.) You will dream. 
Katrina strolls in, sits on the bed.  Ichabod is nervous. 
KATRINA Did they tell?  It is something in the air so that dreams come to everyone.  According to the elders, an Indian prophet held powwows here before the land was taken, and spells cast then still linger to this day. 
ICHABOD Do you often make a habit of sitting on strange men's beds? 
KATRINA You are horribly old-fashioned, aren't you? 
ICHABOD Feel free to form your own opinion. (facing his ledger) Though it appears you already have. 
KATRINA Well, I intended to apologize for the behavior of my friend Brom Van Brunt, but it seems I've made matters worse. (getting up to go) I'll leave you to your business. 
ICHABOD Excuse me... I should apologize.  I, um... I... have no great love of... 
KATRINA Other people? 
ICHABOD Small talk. 
KATRINA It might have been more.  Might have been positively grand talk. 
Ichabod offers his chair, backing away.  Seeing it is the only one, he remains standing.  Katrina sits. 
KATRINA Is it me, or are you this nervous around all women? 
ICHABOD Perhaps it is because your suitor's hands were recently very nearly wrapped around my throat. 
KATRINA My suitor? 
ICHABOD The massive fellow... Brom.  For someone you call "friend," he misplaces a good portion of jealousy. 
KATRINA He has proposed to me twice. 
ICHABOD Which may explain his temperament. To have asked twice means the answer was "no" at least once. 
Katrina looks down, discards this with a smile. 
KATRINA I've read a great deal about your New York City.  Do be a dear and tell me all about it.  Sounds like an extraordinary place to live a life. 
ICHABOD Extra ordinary, yes.  But first, you tell me about the Headless Horseman. 
EXT.  BELLTOWER FIELD -- NIGHT 
The torches burn bright.  ABOVE, in the Belltower, Jonathan Masbath loads a rifle.  THUNDER BOOMS. 
Jonathan stands, looking to a sky that is all stars and moon. A HORSE is HEARD SHRIEKING.  Below, the horse tied at the base of the tower is spooked. 
A COMMOTION is HEARD, ground rumbling.  Jonathan grips a rifle, cocks it and moves to look... 
At the forest edge, a herd of deer stampedes out.  They sprint past the tower and across the field. 
Jonathan crosses to watch the herd scatter.  He crosses back to peer at the forest.  Bad news... 
A thick FOG creeps from the woods. 
As the fog overtakes the base of each torch, a tentacle of mist snakes up to the flame, killing it.  All along the forest, arms of vapor snuff torches... one by one by one... 
Above, Jonathan sights the rifle along the trees. 
JONATHAN Come out, devil... come.... 
INT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT 
Ichabod leans on a dresser.  Katrina's still seated. 
KATRINA Not all think it is the Horseman. Many say witches come from the Western Woods to steal skulls for their cauldrons.  Some believe a person in this very town kneels before Lucifer, offering death as tribute.  And, still others believe none of it. 
ICHABOD Are you so superstitious? 
KATRINA To call a person superstitious is to imply they fear magic, but not all magic is black. 
ICHABOD There is no such thing as magic. 
KATRINA Really?  Then... what is your rebuttal to those romantic poets claiming proof of magic in a rose at full bloom, or even in a teardrop? 
ICHABOD Poets have silly notions about plants and bodily secretions. 
KATRINA (laughs) You are funny. 
Ichabod doesn't get what's so funny about that.  The DISTANT TOLL of a BELL is HEARD.  Katrina looks fearful. 
She goes to open a window.  The BELL TOLLS... 
EXT.  SLEEPY HOLLOW, OVERVIEW -- NIGHT 
... TOLLS mournfully over farms and forests... 
EXT.  FARM -- NIGHT 
BROM Yes.  Seems he panicked across here and broke two legs. 
ICHABOD Who took the meat? 
BALTUS Must have been the Redman.  A Lenape Indian lives in the Western Woods. 
ICHABOD These woods of yours sound a bit crowded, what with all the witches, ghouls and Indians living there. 
Brom climbs up onto his own horse, a black beauty. 
BROM There's only one Lenape.  He eats small animals and lost children... and the occasional constable when he can get it. 
Brom rides.  Ichabod goes to the dead horse, digs in his satchel for a thin iron tool, which he uses it to pry off one HORSESHOE.  A WHISTLE is HEARD O.S. 
Everyone looks far ahead to where Van Ripper has ridden.  The doctor and others are there.  Van Ripper waves. 
INT. FOREST, MASBATH MURDER SITE -- MORNING 
Doctor Lancaster stands with SEVERAL ARMED MEN.  A coffin on a cart is covered by a blanket. Ichabod is crouched nearby. 
ICHABOD Why did you move the body, Doctor? 
DOCTOR LANCASTER To place it inside its coffin. 
Ichabod, nods, vaguely annoyed.  He puts the horseshoe into a hoofprint in the dirt.  It fits. 
Ichabod rises, walks, studying the ground, kicking up leaves. Brom, Van Ripper, Baltus and Philipse watch. 
Ichabod finds a deep hoofprint.  Huge.  He compares the horseshoe.  The hoofprint is much larger. 
Ichabod pulls his satchel off his shoulder, takes out a bowl, bottle of water and bag of brown powder; begins mixing water and powder with a fork to make plaster. 
The others watch, finding this bizarre, whispering.  Brom comes up to stand over Ichabod, irritated. 
BROM What the hell are you doing? 
ICHABOD (ignoring pause) You are the blacksmith.  Ever shod a horse with a hoof this large? 
BROM Never.  A shoe that size I would have remembered. 
Ichabod starts to fill the print with plaster. 
ICHABOD Van Ripper.  Can you show where the body lay? 
VAN RIPPER I can show exactly. 
Van Ripper dismounts, wiping tobacco drool.  Ichabod rises to follow with his satchel. 
VAN RIPPER Here... in front of this oak, facing north.  Horrible... 
ICHABOD To the best of your recollection, where did the open wound fall? 
Van Ripper points.  Ichabod takes a BOTTLE of WHITE POWDER from his pocket. 
He uncorks the bottle, cautiously pouring powder in an x on the dirt there, then waiting. 
A chemical reaction causes the powder to bubble a bit. 
ICHABOD There was not much blood, was there? 
VAN RIPPER I didn't see none. 
Ichabod stands, puzzled.  He walks to the coffin cart, rolling up his sleeves.  Others come to watch, but keep distance.  Ichabod removes the blanket... 
Reveals Jonathan's headless corpse. 
Philipse can't look.  Ichabod takes strange spectacles from his satchel; wire-framed with many lenses.  MAGNIFICATION SPECTACLES.  He examines the gross neck wound, sniffs it. 
He pokes the flesh and severed spinal cord. 
ICHABOD No bleeding. 
DOCTOR LANCASTER What is that? 
ICHABOD This should have bled by the pint. Yet, no blistering or scorched flesh. How... ?  Whatever weapon was used... it cauterized somehow.... 
Ichabod straightens, eyes weirdly big in the spectacles. 
ICHABOD It instantly burnt the wound shut. 
EXT.  CHURCHYARD AND CEMETERY -- DAY 
A coffin in a grave.  Headstone reads "MASBATH, 1799."  A CROWD gathered.  Young Masbath broods.  Clergyman Steenwyck steps forward to take a handful of newly dug dirt. 
Men with guns stand at the outskirts, like on guard. 
Steenwyck sprinkles dirt into the grave with prayerful words. In the crowd people whisper.  They steal glances at Ichabod, who stands with the Van Tassels. 
INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, DINING/VARIOUS ROOMS -- DAY 
Dining room.  Sarah and two other servants collect plates.  A few people still sup, including Van Ripper, his warty WIFE and two kids.  Van Ripper guzzles ale, laughs at something his also-drunk wife says. 
IN the HALL and FOYER, funeral goers socialize quietly. 
FURTHER ON, in the SITTING ROOM, men smoke.  Young Masbath is confronting Ichabod, who is leaving... 
ICHABOD I am not here for revenge.  I am here to bring justice. 
YOUNG MASBATH Whatever.  You still need a second to tend to your things. 
ICHABOD I manage fine alone. 
No answer.  Killian arrives, nods solemnly. 
KILLIAN The Widow Windsor. 
ICHABOD Is that all you say?  Look at her. 
KILLIAN It's not something people speak of openly.  She did not remarry. 
Ichabod kneels, studying.  Now, WE SEE: the belly of the headless corpse is bulbous, because the Widow Windsor was very far along in a pregnancy. 
Ichabod notices: a tear in the cloth of widow's blouse.  He reaches through the tear, feeling the stomach. 
He straightens, greatly troubled. 
INT.  DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, MEDICAL ROOM -- MORNING 
Scissors cut open the widow's blouse.  There's an inch-long WOUND on the moldering belly; a sword puncture. 
Ichabod examines the corpse on a table.  Lancaster watches, anxiously mopping his face.  Young Masbath's in a corner. Ichabod goes to write in his ledger full of notes. 
ICHABOD What is the common thread between these victims? 
YOUNG MASBATH I'm sure I don't know. 
ICHABOD We must discover it.  The reason the murderer chose these persons. 
Ichabod goes to look at the widow's corpse, pondering. 
ICHABOD The wounds are the same.  Cauterized. No chopping or half-measures either. One stroke took the head.  Have you seen, doctor... ? (pointing to it) Even the spinal bone... sliced as smooth as butter. 
DOCTOR LANCASTER I do not care.  You are welcome to use my work area, but I beg you... return her to her resting place. 
ICHABOD In time, doctor.  Soon as I finish. 
Ichabod picks up an iron knife.  He looks to Young Masbath. 
ICHABOD You should step outside. 
EXT.  CHURCHYARD CEMETERY -- EARLY EVENING 
Ichabod and others restore graves.  Ichabod looks to the church, where Clergyman Steenwyck stands in the door. 
FATHER STEENWYCK The devil sent you, Ichabod Crane. The Lord will not forgive your sins. 
Steenwyck shuts the creaky doors. 
INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT 
Ichabod sleeps, dreaming... 
ICHABOD'S DREAM -- FARMLAND -- DAY 
A young BOY, 10, stands in a wheat field with his back to us. A FEMALE VOICE is HEARD FAINTLY, getting LOUDER. 
FEMALE VOICE (O.S.) Ichabod!  Ichabod... come along. 
The boy, YOUNG ICHABOD, turns, smiling.  He runs.  We FOLLOW to a clearing behind a frontier home.  MOTHER waits.  Lovely woman.  She kisses him. 
ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 
Dark.  Young Ichabod, in bed, has one eye open.  Across the room, Mother has her back to him.  She's WHISPERING something to no one.  She turns... 
Young Ichabod pretends he is asleep. 
A DRAWER is HEARD SHUTTING.  Mother exits.  Ichabod gets up, curious, opens a drawer... finds something behind clothing. 
It's a piece of reed grass, woven into an elaborate pattern with shafts of wheat twisted into the center.  Young Ichabod replaces it, closes the drawer. 
ICHABOD'S DREAM -- MARKET SQUARE -- DAY 
A busy, muddy street lined by wares and produce.  Young Ichabod walks with FATHER, an emotionless man.  Father stops to examine tools.  Young Ichabod stays by him, but something captures his attention... 
Across the way, Mother is involved in a argument with a FREAKISH-LOOKING WOMAN.  They shout.  People stop to watch. Can't make out words, but Freakish Woman is furious. 
ICHABOD'S DREAM -- STORM SKY -- NIGHT 
LIGHTNING flashes over tree tops.  THUNDER BOOMS. 
INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT 
Ichabod jerks awake in his bed. 
INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT 
Ichabod enters with a lantern and his ledger.  He sits, studies notes, then notices there's a light down the hall. 
INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SEWING ROOM -- NIGHT 
Opposite an elaborate loom, Katrina reads by candlelight. She looks up, seeing Ichabod enter. 
ICHABOD Sorry for disturbing you.  I thought a forgotten candle was burning. 
Katrina self-consciously closes her shabby book, puts it with another on her lap and covers them. 
KATRINA You do not disturb me.  Please stay. Having trouble sleeping? 
ICHABOD May I ask... why do you cover your book that way? 
KATRINA You pay great attention to small things.  I hide these as I hide all my books.  Father would not approve, lest it were the Bible. 
ICHABOD I, um... I have something to show you, if you have a moment. 
Young Masbath falls in the grass... 
Daredevil's pounding hooves will certainly crush him. 
Daredevil leaps over Young Masbath, continuing the charge. 
Philipse has a long way to go before home.  He looks over his shoulder.  No way he'll make it. 
Ichabod, running, watches Philipse slow. 
Philipse gathers all his courage and stops, turning.  The Horseman is closing, sword held high. 
Philipse raises his talisman. 
ICHABOD Philipse! 
Philipse holds the talisman up, trying to be fearless.  The Horseman swings -- WE HEAR the CLANK of sword on talisman... 
Philipse's severed head spins.  His body falls and folds. 
Ichabod runs past Young Masbath. 
The Horseman halts just as Ichabod reaches a point in front of dead Philipse, aiming his pistol.  Daredevil lets out a SCREECHY CRY.  The Horseman rides toward Ichabod. 
Ichabod gets on one knee, trying to steady his pistol.  The Horseman closes.  Ichabod sweats bullets.  FIRES... 
The slug SLAMS the Horseman dead center -- bursts through and rends his uniform without slowing him. 
The Horseman is almost on Ichabod.  Ichabod cringes, arms up... as the Horseman passes. 
The Horseman leans to skewer Philipse's head with his sword. 
With the head as his prize, the Horseman races away. 
Ichabod gets up, watches the Horseman head to the forest. Ichabod looks to Young Masbath, finds his legs will not support him, falls, trembling.  THUNDER BELLOWS. 
INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SECOND FLOOR HALL -- NIGHT 
Lady Van Tassel comes to a door, knocks.  Sarah stands behind with a tray of food.  Young Masbath is seated near. 
LADY VAN TASSEL (to Young Masbath) Has he not come out at all? 
Young Masbath shakes his head. 
INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT 
KNOCKING is HEARD.  Ichabod sleeps restlessly. 
ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 
THUNDER BOOMS.  WIND and POUNDING RAIN blast open a window. Mother comes to it, then moves to comfort fearful Young Ichabod in bed. 
MOTHER'S VOICE (v.o.) Don't be afraid... don't be afraid. 
ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S HOME -- DAY 
A keyhole.  Young Ichabod's eye peers in... 
ICHABOD'S DREAM -- P.O.V. THROUGH KEYHOLE 
Mother is kneeled before flour on the floor.  She draws patterns in it, whispering.  She blows the flour away. 
ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S HOME -- DAY 
The Freakish Woman (who argued with Mother) walks towards the home, supported by a SAD MAN.  She weeps, carrying something in a blanket. 
Young Ichabod comes a window, watching, scared. 
The Freakish Woman is so weak that she falls.  The blanket opens... the corpse of an infant tumbles to the dirt.  The Freakish Woman's WAILING GROWS LOUDER. 
ICHABOD'S DREAM -- FRONT OF YOUNG ICHABOD'S HOME -- NIGHT 
TWO MEN in black drag Mother to a coach.  She looks back, fearful, pulled along.  A THIRD MAN in black follows. 
Young Ichabod struggles as Father restrains him. 
YOUNG ICHABOD No... mother... no... ! 
The Third Man peers back, a gray-haired, Cotton Mather-ish man with a villainous face. 
FREAKISH WOMAN (v.o.) The night of the great storm, I saw her cross my windows. 
ICHABOD'S DREAM -- COURTROOM -- DAY 
Many people in the gallery.  The Third Man stands in front of the tearful Freakish Woman in the witness box. 
THIRD MAN You are certain it was she? 
FREAKISH WOMAN In the lighting, I did see her. (points) Her.  Lady Crane... 
Mother sits in shackles. 
FREAKISH WOMAN I will never forget.  The next moment, I found my infant dead... with the blood welt on his breast. 
Those in attendance cry out at this.  Ichabod is seated beside Father, eyes filled with tears. 
ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT 
As before, a STORM RAGES.  Ichabod is in Mother's arms. 
FREAKISH WOMAN (v.o.) The night of the great storm, I saw her cross my windows. 
EXT.  WINDMILL ROOF -- DAY 
Ichabod and Young Masbath climb out a door to the roof.  The rotors spin nearby.  Ichabod searches the countryside. 
Below, MANY MEN are ride up the long straight road. 
ICHABOD What is it? 
YOUNG MASBATH It's payment day.  Loan monies are given to Baltus the last day each month.  Almost everyone borrows... for tools or to hire workers. 
Ichabod sits, takes a bowl from his bag and gives it to Masbath, then produces a bottle of water... fills the bowl. 
ICHABOD (points) Out there.  What do you see? 
YOUNG MASBATH The Western Woods. 
ICHABOD Look again. 
A plume of smoke rises from woods, far. 
YOUNG MASBATH Smoke.  Chimney smoke. 
Ichabod holds a piece of straw in his mouth, rubs the point of a sewing needle against a small BLACK ROCK. 
ICHABOD Are you familiar with magnets? 
YOUNG MASBATH What kind of nuts? 
ICHABOD Not for eating, I assure you.  Watch here. 
Ichabod shows the magnet grab the needle.  Young Masbath is amazed, reaching for it.  Ichabod watches him play with it. 
YOUNG MASBATH It's spectacular. 
ICHABOD (smiles, pause) Yes... I suppose it is.  Keep it. 
YOUNG MASBATH No, I couldn't... 
ICHABOD I have others.  All I need is this. 
Ichabod takes the needle, poking its butt end into the tip of the straw.  Young Masbath studies the rock, pockets it. 
YOUNG MASBATH Thank you. 
ICHABOD (nods, almost shy) Now, hold the bowl steady.  Back to business. 
Young Masbath lifts the bowl.  Ichabod drops in the needle/straw which floats and turns compass-like. 
ICHABOD If the Western Woods are truly the Devil's Glen, we will see for ourselves. 
YOUNG MASBATH (uneasy) Father said witches live there. 
ICHABOD Witches do not exist.  However... 
Ichabod uses a knife to notch the bowl lip where the needle points, then surveys the smoke, making a second notch. 
ICHABOD Not long ago, I would have said the same for Headless Horseman. 
KATRINA (o.s.) Constable... ! 
Katrina's on horseback below, unhappy. 
KATRINA I need to speak with you.  Alone. 
EXT.  VAN TASSEL GREAT LAWN -- DAY 
Ichabod and Katrina lead their horses.  A heated argument. 
KATRINA Why would you do such a thing? 
ICHABOD No stone may be left unturned.  It may appear harsh... 
KATRINA I have misjudged you I think.  I did not imagine you were so cruel. 
ICHABOD You are not regarding it in full. The Widow Windsor had been run through by a sword.  I followed the bloodless wound, a wound whose path I could not comprehend till I had seen the Horseman with my own eyes. 
KATRINA What are you on about? 
ICHABOD The child she carried was eight months grown at least... near to birthing.  The sword had pierced its tiny heart exactly. 
KATRINA Must I hear this? 
ICHABOD There was no blind stabbing.  This singular thrust found its target omnipotently, as if the Horseman made certain the unborn child died with its mother. 
KATRINA And this gives worth to butchery? 
ICHABOD It was not butchery. 
KATRINA What is it then?  Scientific method? How can any of this matter in the slightest? 
ICHABOD I have no solution for its meaning yet, but I could not just ignore it. 
KATRINA Take a lesson from Young Masbath's desires, Ichabod Crane.  He follows with you to avenge his father's death. That I understand.  But, what do you want? 
ICHABOD To avenge his father, and the others. 
KATRINA But, why?  Tell me why. 
Ichabod struggles for a reply. 
KATRINA You falter with your answer because you strive without putting the whole of your heart into it.  Can't you see? You'll bring dignity to the dead even if you have to chop them into little pieces to do it. 
The Old Crone holds the bat, using a knife to cut off its head.  She soaks the straw with blood, SPEAKING IN TONGUES, guttural.  Using a wick, she lights the straw. 
She grasps two METAL CUFFS with chains attached, slides these onto her bony wrists, then bends to inhale smoke. 
OLD CRONE He comes now. 
Ichabod would like to leave now. 
EXT.  CAVE HOME -- DAY 
Young Masbath, waiting by the horses, looks up.  Through the trees, black clouds billow and block the sun. 
INT.  CAVE HOME, LOWER CAVE -- DAY 
The old Crone slumps, still with her back to Ichabod.  She does not move.  Wind howls through a hole/window.  Rain. 
Candles blow out.  Ichabod stands, worried. 
ICHABOD Excuse me... um... 
She remains motionless.  The STORM outside intensifies. 
WE SEE the skin of the Crone's wrists transform; swelling in the cuffs, hardening, cracking and bleeding. 
Some thing Ichabod cannot see.  He inches closer. 
ICHABOD Are you alright... ? 
The Crone turns, hideous, leaping erect -- a half-human, half-demon CREATURE.  Its black clawed hands reaching. 
Ichabod recoils, crying out. 
Chains on restraining cuffs yank the creature back. 
Ichabod hits the floor, knocking over a table of bones.  The creature is chained, but still wants Ichabod.  It SCREECHES. 
The Old Crone's face seethes from transformation, eyes blood red, nostrils dripping, teeth now jagged. 
CREATURE/OLD CRONE You seek the warrior bathed in blood... the Headless Horseman. 
Ichabod slides back as far as possible while the creature claws the rock floor, yearning. 
CREATURE/OLD CRONE Follow the Indian trail to where the sun dies.  Follow to the tree of the dead. 
The creature pulls, testing the chains.  Behind, the BOLT holding the chains to the wall slips.  The wall cracks. 
CREATURE/OLD CRONE Climb down to the Horseman's soulless place and let loose his silent shrieking.  Do you hear?  Do you hear?! 
Ichabod nods, quaking, aghast.  He glances to the exit. 
The chain bolt gives more... coming loose... 
CREATURE/OLD CRONE He who holds fast the Horseman's desire will guide his reaping hand. Catch hold of his desire. 
Ichabod bolts for the door.  The creature HOWLS, leaping... 
The chain bolt breaks... 
Ichabod cries out, tackled to the floor... 
It is the Old Crone who landed on him.  She has returned to human form, semi-conscious.  Ichabod shoves her off. 
EXT.  CAVE HOME -- DAY 
Ichabod runs out into the howling storm, past Masbath. 
ICHABOD We are leaving. 
YOUNG MASBATH What happened? 
Ichabod scrambles onto Gunpowder, heading further into the woods, glancing back.  Young Masbath follows. 
EXT.  WESTERN WOODS, FURTHER ON -- EARLY EVENING 
No rain.  Dark.  A lantern's glow creates shifting shadows as Ichabod and Young Masbath ride. 
YOUNG MASBATH Follow the Indian trail to where the sun dies.  To the tree of the dead. (looking back) Maybe we passed it by. 
ICHABOD How could something named "the tree of the dead" fail to draw attention? 
A BIRD CRIES OUT.  Ichabod's startled, looking up.  The BIRD is HEARD ALIGHTING.  Leaves float downwards. 
ICHABOD We should not go much further in this murk. 
YOUNG MASBATH Should we go back? 
ICHABOD We are far from the Hollow. (dismounts, troubled) Loath to say it... better to get our backs against a tree and stay till morning. 
EXT.  WESTERN WOODS (TIME CUT) -- NIGHT 
Horses are tied.  Ichabod is seated against a tree.  A campfire burns.  Young Masbath lies on a blanket, rifle cross his chest, staring to treetops. 
Leaves and branches shift in the wind.  Bats fly wildly. 
YOUNG MASBATH What does it mean... climb down to the Horseman's soulless place? 
ICHABOD "Let loose his silent shrieking." Who knows, till we work at it?  I admit not being anxious to find out. (pause) "He who holds the Horseman's desire will guide his reaping hand." Whatever the Horseman's desire is, other than extinguishing lives. 
A SNAPPING BRANCH.  Ichabod raises his pistol. 
ICHABOD (to Young Masbath) Do not move. 
KATRINA Stop this!  Leave them alone! 
A SHOT RINGS OUT.  Chaos halts.  Everyone turns, quieting. 
The men around Masbath and Ichabod turn to face Brom Bones. Brom holds a smoking pistol, flanked by Theodore and Glenn. 
BROM Let them go (pointing) Are you going to beat an orphaned child, imbecile? 
Masbath is released, along with the ledger.  Steenwyck moves forward, pushing people aside. 
FATHER STEENWYCK Are you Ichabod Crane's protector, Brom Bones? 
BROM Only for the moment. 
FATHER STEENWYCK You side with him in this? 
BROM No.  I agree he has only made matters worse.  But, that will change, if you listen. 
He trades with Theodore, pistol for a long rifle.  Brom hefts the rifle, taking a round slug from his pocket. 
BROM Theodore, Glenn and I offer to ride each day and night to watch over the Hollow.  We will stalk the border of the Western Woods and haunt the Horseman for a change, with rifles like this... and slugs like this... 
Brom brings the slug to his lips, blows.  It WHISTLES. 
BROM Hollowed out and filled with powder. 
Brom smiles at Katrina, who watches unimpressed. 
BROM Constable Crane is not the only one who fights with science on his side. 
ICHABOD I fired upon the Horseman and the bullet did nothing. 
BROM You must have missed your mark. 
ICHABOD I hit him square. 
BROM (to the crowd) I say... if the Horseman is solid enough to take the lives of our people, he's solid enough to feel this... 
Brom aims the rifle at a BARREL down the road.  FIRES. 
PLUNK -- the barrel is hit -- EXPLODES.  Smoke wafts. 
INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT 
In bed, Ichabod is having unpleasant dreams once more. 
FREAKISH WOMAN (v.o.) The night of the great storm, I saw her cross my windows. 
ICHABOD'S DREAM -- COURTROOM -- DAY 
Young Ichabod is seated beside Father, eyes tearful.  We are back in the court where Mother stands trial. 
FREAKISH WOMAN In the lightning, I did see her. (points to Mother) Her. Lady Crane... I will never forget it.  The next moment, I found my infant son was dead, with the blood welt on his breast. 
The evil Third Man turns to a jury of TWELVE MEN. 
THIRD MAN You have heard it.  The blood welt is the mark of Satan's touch. 
As the crowd murmurs in fear, Young Ichabod looks to Father, who sits with hands clenched, emotionless. 
ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S HOME -- NIGHT 
In the quiet kitchen, Young Ichabod looks across the table. Father stares into his food. 
YOUNG ICHABOD She was with me, father. 
FATHER Nothing can be done against them. 
YOUNG ICHABOD She was with me that night. 
Father doesn't even look up. 
ICHABOD'S DREAM -- CHURCH -- NIGHT 
Empty church.  Young Ichabod carries a lantern past pews.  A soldier is seated near the altar with a rifle. 
YOUNG ICHABOD May I see her? 
The soldier exits through a white door.  Young Ichabod waits, looking up at the vast church.  The white door opens and the Third Man steps out. 
THIRD MAN Go home. 
YOUNG ICHABOD May I see my mother? 
THIRD MAN You do not want to be here.  Go home to your father. 
YOUNG ICHABOD She did not do it... please listen... 
THIRD MAN She is guilty. 
YOUNG ICHABOD No, sir, please... she is innocent... 
THIRD MAN She has confessed. 
YOUNG ICHABOD No. 
THIRD MAN She has admitted to her evil and signed a written confession.  Do you know what confession is? (off Ichabod's nod) All that is left for you now is to pray for her soul. 
The Third Man leaves through the white door. 
ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S BEDROOM -- MORNING 
Rain.  Ichabod comes out.  Across the lawn, Young Masbath is bringing the horses. 
LADY VAN TASSEL (o.s.) Good morrow, Constable. 
Ichabod turns to see Lady Van Tassel in a chair, sewing. 
LADY VAN TASSEL Returning to the Western Woods? 
ICHABOD Yes, actually. 
LADY VAN TASSEL Use caution. 
ICHABOD (nods, studies her) Do you know... I think those are the first words I have heard from you my entire time here. 
LADY VAN TASSEL As my husband says, a wife should be always like an echo, and at the same time, quite unlike an echo. (off Ichabod's confusion) Like an echo, she should speak only when spoken to, and unlike an echo, should never try to have the last word, or, at least that is what he believes. 
Baltus comes out the door, irritable, skillet in hand. 
BALTUS Constable... did you notice anything out of the ordinary during the night? 
Ichabod eyes the skillet, ill at ease, trying not to be. 
ICHABOD Um... I... I did not... no.  Why? 
BALTUS Sarah has gone missing... my servant girl.  Her things are gone.  Damn it. She has joined the migration out of town. (to Lady Van Tassel) What about breakfast, woman?  Or, am I to starve to death? 
Lady Van Tassel gets up and goes in, taking the skillet. 
ICHABOD I should be going... good day to you. 
Ichabod heads towards Young Masbath.  Baltus watches from the porch, disgruntled.  He goes in. 
EXT.  WESTERN WOODS -- DAY 
Heavy rain.  Ichabod and Young Masbath ride side by side. 
YOUNG MASBATH If the Crone's wound bled hard, that means she was not killed by the Hessian.  Someone only tried to make it look that way. 
ICHABOD You grow sharper by the minute, little man.  It boggles my mind, but I begin to prefer your company over all others. 
YOUNG MASBATH Well... I'm one of the few people who likes you. 
ICHABOD (laughs) True enough. 
YOUNG MASBATH Then, who murdered the Old Crone?  And why? 
ICHABOD Good questions, deserving answers, of which we are in short supply. 
A SOUND is HEARD.  Ichabod looks back, then to Masbath. 
ICHABOD Quicken pace. 
Ichabod rides faster.  Young Masbath keeps up. 
FURTHER ON, they charge over a hill.  Ichabod halts Gunpowder and climbs clumsily off. 
ICHABOD Ride on. 
Young Masbath obeys.  Ichabod takes out his pistol and wades into forest growth, backtracking. 
INSIDE THE FOREST, Ichabod bounds through underbrush, low.  A HORSE is HEARD SNORTING.  He pushes through branches... 
Moving behind a FIGURE IN A GREY CLOAK on horseback. 
ICHABOD Halt and turn.  I have a pistol aimed at your head. 
The figure stops, pushes off the cloak hood.  Katrina. 
KATRINA It is only me. 
ICHABOD Katrina.  Why do you follow? 
KATRINA I apologize if I worried you. 
ICHABOD A woman should not be out alone in these woods. 
KATRINA But, I am not alone, am I?  I only wished to see what you were up to, and... (takes out WHITE ROSE) To thank you. 
Ichabod softens, but doesn't want to. 
ICHABOD Come along. 
EXT.  WESTERN WOODS, TREE OF THE DEAD -- DAY 
Raining still.  Ichabod, Masbath and Katrina come into a clearing, mouths falling open at the sight of... 
A monstrously huge TREE OF THE DEAD, at the clearing's center, with branches reaching far and wide, knotted and gross, like agony captured in wood sculpture. 
Ichabod dismounts, crossing a line beyond which grass and weeds will not grow.  Young Masbath and Katrina dismount. 
YOUNG MASBATH You were right... it does draw attention to itself. 
Ichabod stares up into the endless, dead canopy of branches. He circles the incredibly wide trunk. 
There's a VERTICAL WOUND in the bark, as if the tree once had a terrible vertical in it, now partially healed and disgustingly scarred.  Ichabod approaches. 
He feels the mushy scar, picking at its scabs till much sap begins to trickle. It is red and Ichabod fingers it. 
ICHABOD Blood. 
KATRINA What did you say? 
ICHABOD His next victim is chosen! (to Masbath) Give me distance, then guide her back to the Hollow. 
Ichabod runs towards the horses. 
YOUNG MASBATH Constable! 
EXT.  WESTERN WOODS -- DAY 
The Horseman rips past on Daredevil. 
EXT.  BEHIND IN WESTERN WOODS -- DAY 
Ichabod rides as fast as Gunpowder is able. 
INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY 
Small home.  Killian, Thomas and Beth have finished supper. Beth clears plates as Killian picks his teeth with a knife. 
THOMAS May I be excused, father? 
KILLIAN Do you deserve to be? 
THIRD MAN (shyly) I think so. 
KILLIAN (smiles) Then, go. 
Thomas gets down from his chair.  He goes to the fireplace to light a tallow wick, which he takes to the next room. 
INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- DAY 
Thomas plops on the floor and lights his MAGIC LANTERN: a lantern with an outer sleeve of glass painted with silhouettes of lions and monsters. 
Thomas turns the lantern and looks to the walls where the creatures, shadows are thrown.  He roars for them, imagining them real and having a grand time. 
INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY 
Beth comes for more dishes. 
BETH Don't pick teeth.  You teach Thomas bad habits. 
Killian pulls her to him, playful. 
KILLIAN I am a bad habit.  There's nothing for it. 
BETH (kisses him) No one knows better than I. 
INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- DAY 
Thomas continues his fun, shadow animals circling him. 
In the shifting light, a baby spider comes from a crack in the wall.  Then, another spider skitters out.  More follow. 
EXT.  FORESTS -- DAY 
A black horse runs, hooves pounding the ground.  THUNDER is HEARD.  The horse slows and stops... it is Brom's horse, with Brom aboard.  Brom looks skyward. 
The storm harshens, roaring through the trees.  Distant HOOFBEATS can be HEARD.  POUNDING. 
Brom takes his rifle off his shoulder.  The HOOFBEATS grow LOUDER and PASS, far away.  Brom turns in the saddle and WHISTLES.  He kicks his horse and rides. 
INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- DAY 
Thomas still watches shadow beasts, but sees something else. He goes to the crack where hundreds of spiders flee all directions. Thomas is amused. 
INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY 
Behind Killian, mantelpiece stones pulse, breathing almost imperceptibly.  Demonic faces form, then disappear and reform again, shifting.  WIND HOWLS. 
INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- DAY 
Beth enters, looking at Thomas. 
BETH What are you doing there? 
The magic lantern stops spinning.  Shadow creatures freeze. 
INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY 
The ENTIRE HOUSE CREAKS.  Killian looks up.  CREAKING STOPS. The HOWLING WIND is LOUD. 
INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, THE WHITE ROOM -- DAY 
Beth comes to Thomas' side as he points. 
THOMAS Spiders. 
Beth bends to see the swarming spiders.  She looks up, noticing the FEROCITY of the WIND. 
INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY 
Killian stands, looking up.  The HOUSE CREAKS again, then suddenly the WIND CEASES.  Silence. 
KILLIAN Beth... 
INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, THE WHITE ROOM -- DAY 
Beth picks up Thomas.  The magic lantern creatures begin spinning anew, all around. 
INT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY 
With a ROAR, the fire flares.  Killian looks. 
Brom readies his ramrod, jamming powder in the barrel. 
The Horseman charges. 
Brom stands, pulling out the ramrod.  The Horseman is on him. Brom swings the rifle, blocking.  Sparks fly. 
The battle is on, with Brom fending off the Horseman's sword with the gun -- CLANK -- CLANK -- CLANK. 
ACROSS THE FIELD, Ichabod and Gunpowder break into the open. 
UP THE FIELD, the Horseman makes a backhanded swing.  Brom goes down, his rifle sent flying. 
Brom rolls to avoid as the Horseman slashes. 
Brom flees.  The Horseman pulls and throws a knife... 
THWAP -- the knife imbeds in Brom's thigh. 
The Horseman runs towards Brom. 
Ichabod closes in, pulling an unlit lantern off his saddle. 
Brom tries to get up, bends to extract the knife. 
The Horseman, mid-run, changes his sword grip, blade down. 
He plants one foot on Brom's back, raising his sword, about to skewer... 
Ichabod arrives full gallop, SMASHES the lantern into the Horseman -- knocking the Horseman off Brom. 
AT THE EDGE OF THE FOREST, Theodore and Glen arrive on horseback.  They hold a moment, watching. 
Brom runs, limping, to the barn, goal in sight: farm implements propped there.  Brom grabs SCYTHES with long curved blades, one in per hand. 
The Horseman rises. 
Ichabod turns Gunpowder and leaps off, runs to Brom. 
The Horseman moves towards them, hefting a battle axe in his free hand.  Ichabod steps up, pistol aimed, furious. 
ICHABOD For what it's worth... 
FIRES -- the bullet rips through the Horseman's stomach to reveal putrid innards as he keeps advancing. 
At the forest, Theodore looks to Glenn, turns and flees. 
Brom steps up, scythes ready.  He and the Horseman go at it. Brom blocks axe and sword, catching and deflecting blows. 
At the forest, Glenn follows Theodore away. 
Ichabod grabs a long handled SICKLE. 
Brom swings the scythes.  The Horseman avoids. 
Ichabod moves to the side, looking for an opening.  He swings the sickle. The Horseman blocks. 
The Horseman battles both at once, catching blows... countering every strike, METAL RINGING. 
Brom catches the Horseman's sword in one scythe, holding it off.  Catches the axe handle in the other scythe. 
The Horseman flatfoot KICKS Brom's chest, sending him down. 
Ichabod swings the sickle blade... 
Hits the Horseman, the blade embedding to the hilt. 
The Horseman drops his axe and grasps the sickle, jerking... 
The sickle handle SLAMS Ichabod's, knocking him away. 
Ichabod crawls, tries to shake off the blow. 
He looks up.  The Horseman staggers, spastically trying to pull the blade from his body. 
Brom limps to Ichabod, yanks him to his feet. 
BROM We cannot win this. 
They head towards the forest. 
Behind, the Horseman extracts the sickle, throws it.  He strides after them, picks up his axe on the way. 
EXT.  RIVERBANK -- DAY 
Ichabod and Brom stumble down a hillside.  Brom points. 
BROM There... 
They run to a DOCK at the edge of a wide, rapid river.  They jump into a FLAT BOAT barge. 
BROM Go to the front and guide it. 
Ichabod goes.  Brom uses a scythe to slash the ropes. 
Ichabod picks up a GUIDE POLE.  The barge lurches, set free. 
Ichabod struggles to push the boat out.  it moves swiftly, caught in rain swollen current. 
Brom looks back.  No Horseman.  He leaves the scythe and moves to the front, hefting another pole to help guide. 
BROM Let's see him catch us now. 
Ichabod's hurting.  Masbath helps with a shirt. 
YOUNG MASBATH Someone left last night.  Looked like they headed to the square, but I lost them in the forest. 
ICHABOD Man or woman? 
YOUNG MASBATH All I saw was their lantern. 
ICHABOD Business, best hidden is hidden best at night. 
Ichabod goes to his work table, organizing his satchel. 
YOUNG MASBATH If someone has the Horseman's skull... if they control the Horseman, then why haven't they sent him for your head yet? 
ICHABOD Because, I serve a fine purpose alive. It is perfection for our murderer if I return to New York City with nothing more than tales of a galloping ghoul. (pause) We must uncover the reason these victims were targeted.  What was taken from them... other than their lives? Who benefits by their deaths? 
Ichabod fumbles the bottle of white powder. 
It bounces, cork popping out... rolls under the bed. 
ICHABOD Damn it. 
Ichabod kneels, pained.  A trail of the blood-detecting powder has spilled.  The bottle is out of reach. 
YOUNG MASBATH I'll get it. 
Young Masbath gets down, ready to crawl for it, but Ichabod stops him, peering under. 
ICHABOD Wait... 
Far under, near the bottle, some powder is bubbling. 
Ichabod moves to the end of the bed and lifts, in pain. Young Masbath helps. They drag the bed to one side. 
Under the bed: a Satanic PENTAGRAM has been DRAWN IN BLOOD. 
Ichabod stares, trying to grasp the implication.  Masbath is about to speak, but Ichabod puts a finger to his lips. 
Ichabod moves to lock the door. 
YOUNG MASBATH (whispers) Who did this? 
Ichabod does not answer.  He picks up a wash basin and dumps the water to wash the Pentagram away. 
EXT.  TOWN SQUARE/CHURCH -- DAY 
WAGONS, HORSES and TOWNSPEOPLE swarm.  A CROWD loots the town's general store.  Provisions are passed along man to man and loaded on wheelbarrows. 
All up and down the long straight road, home owners board up windows with lumber. 
Ichabod and Young Masbath ride, passing many angry faces. 
ICHABOD Panic has set in. 
They stop, tying their horses and climbing stairs to the door of the "NOTARY."  Ichabod looks off... 
DOWN THE ROAD, at the far end, people head to the church. Much activity there as well. 
ICHABOD Sanctuary.  Or, so they hope. 
Families put up tents all around the church within the bordering wrought-iron fence.  Supplies abound. 
People work to build and erect massive wooden crosses. 
INT.  NOTARY PUBLIC, HARDENBROOK'S OFFICES -- DAY 
Tidy room.  Young Masbath watches Ichabod hand a slip of paper to the elderly Notary, Hardenbrook. 
ICHABOD Do you have these persons' wills? 
HARDENBROOK I have everything... last testaments... birth certificates, death certificates... deeds. 
ICHABOD Yes, sir... but, do you have these? 
Hardenbrook studies the paper with his one good eye. 
HARDENBROOK Certainly... certainly. 
Hardenbrook nods, handing the list back, grinning.  Ichabod stands waiting.  Hardenbrook is still nodding. 
ICHABOD May I see them, Master Hardenbrook? 
HARDENBROOK Hmm?  See them? 
ICHABOD May we look at them now? 
HARDENBROOK Of course.  You want them... it shall not take long.  Wait here. 
Hardenbrook heads across the room.  Ichabod offers the list. 
ICHABOD Maybe you should take this. 
HARDENBROOK A fine idea. 
Hardenbrook takes it and exits.  Young Masbath sits. 
YOUNG MASBATH What good is this? 
ICHABOD To discover what might have been taken from those who died, it will help to know what was there that could be taken in the first place. 
Ichabod waits.  After a moment, he looks uncertain.  He crosses to the half-open door... 
Ichabod comes away from the window, looking to panicked citizens.  He sees Katrina moving up the aisle... 
She's heading towards Baltus, who slams against the door to Steenwyck's room. 
BALTUS Damn you, Steenwyck!  Help me! Let me in! 
RIFLES BOOM LOUDLY as men at the windows begin firing. 
EXT.  CHURCH -- DAY 
The Horseman circles, under fire. 
Great clouds of gun smoke shoot from the church. 
Men fire down from the belfry. 
Parts of the Horseman and Daredevil splatter red into the rain as slugs hit without effect. 
AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CHURCH, the Horseman comes around, heading to the town square. 
INT.  CHURCH -- DAY 
Rifleman shout to each other, running to the opposite windows to follow the Horseman. 
Young Masbath grabs a rifle and leaps to join the brigade. 
Baltus is still beating Steenwyck's door when a HUGE FARMER grips Baltus angrily and throws him... 
HUGE FARMER You'll kill us all! 
Baltus falls, knocking over pews.  Katrina's nearby. 
HUGE FARMER You're the one the Horseman wants. Why should we die for you!? 
KATRINA NO! 
The huge farmer picks Baltus up, dragging him and shoving Katrina aside as she approaches. 
Ichabod's pushing past people, trying to reach them. 
EXT.  CHURCH/TOWN SQUARE -- DAY 
The Horseman brings Daredevil to a halt, yanking a large coil of ROPE off a hitching post. 
INT.  CHURCH -- DAY 
The huge farmer shoves Baltus to the floor again. 
HUGE FARMER Get out! 
Others join the rage, pulling Baltus towards the front of the church, shouting.  Ichabod struggles to push them off. 
ICHABOD Stop this! 
Ichabod gets to Baltus' side, trying to protect. 
ICHABOD The Horseman cannot enter!  It does not matter who he wants, he cannot cross the gate! 
At the windows, ONE RIFLEMAN turns, crying out. 
ONE RIFLEMAN He's coming back! 
More panic.  The huge farmer moves towards Baltus. 
HUGE FARMER We have to save ourselves! 
Baltus pulls the pistol from Ichabod's holster, brandishing. 
BALTUS No!  Get away from me! 
EXT.  CHURCH -- DAY 
The Horseman rides past the front, fired upon. 
He halts at the wrought iron gate, reaching to yank off one POST which is pointed on top, like an arrow head. 
INT.  CHURCH -- DAY 
Baltus holds everyone's back with the pistol. 
BALTUS The next person to lay hands on me will have a bullet.  Stand off! 
KATRINA Father... 
BALTUS No!  We're safe here. (points at Ichabod) You said it.  The Horseman will not have me. 
CRASH, the harpoon-like post SPEARS through a window, trailing rope tied to it... 
CRACK -- SKEWERS Baltus from behind, the bloodied point bursting out his breast bone. 
Baltus looks down, drops the gun... clutching the post with both hands.  Blood streams out his mouth.  Katrina screams. 
The rope yanks Baltus back.  He SLAMS into the WINDOW... 
EXT.  CHURCH -- DAY 
Baltus CRASHES out, hits the ground, dragged... 
Outside the fence, Daredevil runs with the rope tied around his saddle pommel.  The Horseman strides forward, sword out. 
Baltus SLAMS the fence and the rope snaps.  He is held there awkwardly, gurgling blood. 
EXT.  TOWN SQUARE/CHURCH -- NIGHT 
Ichabod's coach moves through the town square.  A few people in the churchyard's tent city come out to watch it pass. 
INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT 
The door is pushed open.  Young Masbath enters, looks around the empty room.  He goes to sit in a chair at the work table, crossing his arms and resting his head. 
INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SITTING ROOM -- NIGHT 
A plate of food sits untouched.  Katrina is slumped down in a chair, heartbroken, staring into the fireplace. 
Behind her, a shadow moves across the room. 
EXT.  THE LONG STRAIGHT ROAD -- NIGHT 
Van Ripper leads the coach through the stone pillars marking the entrance of Sleepy Hollow. 
INT.  ICHABOD'S COACH -- NIGHT 
Ichabod takes off his hat, sets it on the seat.  The window between him and the driver slides open. 
VAN RIPPER Sir... this is yours. (offering something) The Van Tassel girl said to give it to you after you were gone. 
Ichabod takes it.  It is the bird/cage spinning toy.  He studies it.  What melancholy. 
INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, DINING ROOM -- NIGHT 
Katrina sits with her eyes closed.  A BOARD is HEARD CREAKING.  She sits up. Suddenly, a FIGURE in black is behind her as she turns.  WHACK! -- a gloved fist strikes. 
INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT 
A dull THUD is HEARD downstairs, like a body falling.  Young Masbath takes notice.  He moves to the door... 
INT.  ICHABOD'S COACH -- NIGHT 
Ichabod turns the strings on the bird/cage toy, ponders it. 
The paper disk spins, images flickering until the bird appears to be inside the cage. 
Ichabod keeps spinning it, looks out the window. 
A tear rolls down his cheek. 
The bird cage toy's rotation slows... stops. 
Ichabod looks at it a long moment, then pockets it and leans forward to the window at front. 
OUTSIDE THE COACH 
Ichabod's face appears behind Van Ripper. 
ICHABOD Van Ripper, turn the coach about! 
VAN RIPPER What did you say? 
ICHABOD Turn around.  Now! 
INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, FOYER -- NIGHT 
Young	Masbath comes down the stairs, looking around meekly. 
YOUNG MASBATH Hello?  Katrina? 
Masbath starts down a hall.  He does not see, in another room, Katrina's body is dragged across the floor. 
EXT.  TOWN SQUARE, DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE -- NIGHT 
The coach comes to Lancaster's.  Ichabod climbs out before it even stops fully, satchel in hand.  He hurries... 
INT.  DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, PARLOR -- NIGHT 
Doctor Lancaster, half asleep, comes to answer BANGING on his door.  Ichabod pushes past, taking Lancaster's lantern. 
ICHABOD Pardon the intrusion... 
INT.  DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, MEDICAL ROOM -- NIGHT 
Ichabod enters.  There are two coffins on the floor. 
ICHABOD I never examined these bodies. 
Ichabod removes the lid from one coffin.  Lancaster is about to say something indignant, but then just looks disgusted. 
DOCTOR LANCASTER ... help yourself, you pompous ass. I will be in bed. 
ICHABOD Would you stay, doctor?  I may need assistance. 
Lancaster reluctantly remains.  Ichabod stares at the dead Lady Van Tassel.  The neck wound is covered by a stained brown cloth, which Ichabod unwraps. 
ICHABOD Stains of blood. 
DOCTOR LANCASTER What of it? 
Ichabod takes out one of the lenses that survived the magnification spectacles, bends to examine the neck. 
ICHABOD Jagged flesh. (pause) The Horseman did not do this. 
Ichabod moves to the side of the coffin, lifting the hand with the stitched gash on its palm. 
ICHABOD Here, Doctor.  Hold this just so... 
ICHABOD Go! 
Ichabod takes the reins from Young Masbath. 
ICHABOD Help her. 
Reins in one hand and saw in the other, Ichabod waits.  The Horseman rises up and moves in, taking out his sword. 
Young Masbath climbs down to the wooden pole connecting the coach to the bridles, puts out his hand.  Katrina takes it. 
Behind, the Horseman swings.  Ichabod blocks with the saw. 
Young Masbath guides Katrina as she leaps onto one horse. Bareback.  Young Masbath straddles the horse beside her. 
The Horseman swings, backhanded knocks the sword from Ichabod's hand as Ichabod falls back... 
Ichabod hits the bridle post, hanging onto straps for dear life.  His feet drag on the trail. 
Above, the Horseman comes to the driver's perch, close enough to kill Katrina.  He raises his sword... 
Katrina screams, ducking, helpless... 
Below, Ichabod pulls a bolt from the coach's hitching-rod. 
He shoves off with his feet. 
The Horseman swings.... missing. 
The horses detach from the coach, dragging Ichabod along. 
The coach careens out of control. 
It flies off the trail, hits an incline and sails off, throwing the Horseman. 
The coach hits a tree trunk and SMASHES. 
FURTHER DOWN THE TRAIL, the coach horses stop.  Young Masbath and Katrina climb off as Ichabod gets to his feet, hurting, clutching his previously wounded shoulder. 
YOUNG MASBATH What now? 
ICHABOD I doubt that's the end. 
KATRINA The church. 
ICHABOD He moves too fast. 
Ichabod unhooks a lantern off the bridle rail.  The trail behind is silent, till a bone chilling SCREECH is HEARD. 
KATRINA What was that? 
ICHABOD His horse. 
They start moving.  Ichabod looks around.  He sees... 
ICHABOD There... 
Through the tree line, the Hollow's massive windmill can be seen against the sky.  Katrina and Young Masbath run. 
EXT. WINDMILL FIELD -- NIGHT 
Ichabod, Katrina and Young Masbath book into this open area, heading to the windmill.  Another HORRIBLE SQUEAL echoes. 
Ichabod looks over his shoulder. 
Heavy, low hanging BRANCHES and VINES at the forest edge creep to life, parting... forming a sort of black tunnel. 
ICHABOD He's coming! 
The Horseman gallops out, throwing leaves in his wake. 
ICHABOD Hurry! 
The Horseman readies a battle axe. 
Ichabod gets under the windmill, helping Young Masbath up the ladder and in.  Katrina next. 
The Horseman is almost there. 
Ichabod follows Katrina.  He gets in, feet dangling.  The Horseman dismounts... 
INT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT 
Ichabod leaps up and struggles with the heavy trap door... slams it.  He closes the latch just as the Horseman hits. The door buckles. 
YOUNG MASBATH It won't hold. 
Ichabod goes to a large GRINDSTONE against a wall.  He struggles to roll it. 
Young Masbath helps him roll it to the trap door.  It falls on top with a thud.  The Horseman's sword jabs up through the grindstone's center hole. 
The sword withdraws.  A POUNDING begins. 
EXT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT 
The Horseman chops at the door with his axe. 
INT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT 
POUNDING CONTINUES.  The grindstone shifts.  Katrina and Young Masbath back away.  Ichabod holds his lantern up, desperate for ideas, searching. 
Above, to the right, is the milling platform, where grain is ground and bagged.  To the left is the crooked staircase. 
Ichabod shepherds Katrina and Young Masbath to the edge where the rotors spin close. 
ICHABOD The blades will carry us to the ground. Face front and wait for me. 
KATRINA I... I can't do this. 
ICHABOD We have no choice. 
Ichabod moves back to the trap door. 
Katrina and Young Masbath look at the rotors, and down at the long distance between them and the ground. 
ICHABOD Be ready... 
Ichabod throws the lantern into the windmill and runs. 
ICHABOD Now! 
INT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT 
The Horseman continues up.  The lantern falls past. 
EXT.  WINDMILL, ROOF -- NIGHT 
Young Masbath jumps.  Ichabod grips Katrina and jumps... 
They hit one rotor and cling to the frame and cloth.  The rotor begins its downwards swing. 
INT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT 
The lantern hits the ground and shatters.  FLAMES EXPLODE! 
Grain dust is consumed instantaneously -- FLAMES ROAR upwards, filling the windmill... 
Engulfing the Horseman. 
EXT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT 
The rotor is halfway to its lowest point.  Masbath, Katrina and Ichabod hang on as the entire structure trembles. 
BOOM -- flames shoot out the windows, doors and seams, lighting up the night. 
On the rattling rotor, Ichabod struggles to hold the frame with one hand and keep a grip on Katrina. 
Masbath drops.  Ichabod releases Katrina, then drops. 
They hit the ground.  Ichabod rolls, gasping, holding his shoulder.  They all look at each other in disbelief a moment. Ichabod lets out a sort of rasping laugh, standing. 
ICHABOD Okay... come on... 
Ichabod ushers them across the field, uphill.  Running. Lightning flashes across the sky.  THUNDER RUMBLES. 
A bolt strikes the windmill, and it EXPLODES... 
SHOCKWAVE DEAFENING.  The rotors bust apart.  Splinters of burning wood spin all directions. 
ACROSS THE FIELD, Ichabod, Katrina and Young Masbath keep running.  There is a WOODEN CART parked ahead. 
IN THE WINDMILL RUBBLE, the Horseman rises, shoving off burning debris.  His flame-ravaged uniform smolders. 
ACROSS THE FIELD, Ichabod stumbles onwards, but notices something horrible... 
In the distance, Lady Van Tassel's white horse roams free. 
ICHABOD (as this registers) Oh, no... 
Young Masbath and Katrina are just past the cart when Lady Van Tassel rises from behind it, swings a plank... 
SLAMS Ichabod in the chest and sends him down. 
Lady Van Tassel grabs Katrina's hair, drags her. 
LADY VAN TASSEL Should have stayed away, Constable. 
Ichabod gets up slow, furious, reaches to his holster, only to find it empty.  He moves forward. 
LADY VAN TASSEL Keep back, or I kill her. 
She takes out scissors, holds them to Katrina's neck. Katrina ceases struggling. 
Ichabod keeps Masbath behind him, keeps his distance.  Lady Van Tassel shoots a glance... 
LADY VAN TASSEL See him... 
Par off, the Horseman strides from the wreckage. 
LADY VAN TASSEL You cannot kill what is already dead. 
ICHABOD Let her go! 
LADY VAN TASSEL Yes... yes.  I think I will... 
Lady Van Tassel spins and throws Katrina in the cart, shoving against it. 
ICHABOD No! 
The cart rolls downhill.  Ichabod moves forward. 
Lady Van Tassel turns, brandishing the scissors, slashing and missing.  Ichabod backs off. 
DOWNHILL, the cart picks up speed, headed for the Horseman.

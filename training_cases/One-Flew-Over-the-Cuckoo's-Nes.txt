One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest 
EXT. WORK FARM - NIGHTFALL 
All we SEE is an ELEVATED SHOT of the distant mountains, rolling landscape and McMURPHY -- one cheek laid-open and crusted over with dried blood, his face and prison work clothes caked with dried sweat and dust -- as he sits on the very top of a water tower watching the last rays of sunlight. 
A long moment passes before McMurphy's attention is drawn elsewhere and he looks down. 
REVERSE SHOT - McMURPHY'S POV 
Far below, in the prison yard a MAN is SEEN hurrying acrcss the yard where he joins a group of men composed of armed prison guards, officials, and medics -- a stretcher, an ambulance, a fire truck and safety nets spread out at the base of the water tower. The man is seen talking to the officials, then a bullhorn is handed to him and they all look up at McMurphy. 
McMURPHY 
As he looks down at them, a searchlight is turned on him. 
MAN (V.O.) (through bullhorn) McMurphy! This is Doctor Shankle, from the infirmary. Can you hear me? 
McMurphy doesn't respond. 
SHANKLE (V.O.) (through bullhorn) Can you hear me, McMurphy? 
McMurphy doesn't respond. Another searchlight goes on as a SECOND VOICE is PICKED UP on the BULLHORN. 
SECOND VOICE (through bullhorn) Why don't we blast 'im, for Christ sake, he ain't gonna come down... you... 
The BULLHORN is TURNED OFF. A long moment passes as McMurphy continues to squat on the tower and wait. He shivers against the coming night when... 
SHANKLE (V.O.) (through bullhorn) McMurphy! I have the warden's promise. If you come down, nobody will hurt you! You'll be in my custody! I promise! 
An imperceptible smile appears on McMurphy's face. 
INT. MEN'S DORM - OREGON STATE HOSPITAL - DAWN 
Strange HUMMING SOUNDS, CLANKING PIPES and HISSING RADIATORS as we see beds, with patients lying asleep, line two walls. The third wall is a heavy gauge steel grill, with a door that opens on to the day room. The door is open. On the far side of the day room, a long hallway with other doors opening into rooms: the latrine, washroom, tub room, mess hall, seclusion room, psychiatrist's office, visitors' room, etc. 
Across the day room, a glass enclosed nurses' station where TURKLE, a Negro night attendant, is seen preparing to go off duty. 
The CAMERA PANS the beds in the men's dorm. One man turns, another twists, a third lies as if dead. 
CAMERA PAN ENDS on BROMDEN, who lies still, eyes wide open, very alert. He reaches down, plucks a stale piece of gum from under the bed frame, puts it in his mouth and starts chewing. 
A beat, then Bromden carefully undoes the leather strap which binds him to the bed. He slips out of bed and quietly makes his way down the aisle, paying no attention to the other patients, some of who are beginning to stir awake. 
Ahead, at the end of the hallway, the door opens and three Negro day attendants, WASHINGTON, WARREN and MILLER, dressed in white uniforms, enter and move down the hallway and disappear into a side room. 
Bromden continues his silent journey towards the day room as Turkle emerges from the side door to the nurses' lounge, goes up the hallway as MISS PILBOW, the day nurse, comes in, passing Turkle on the way out. She crosses to the nurses' station and enters as Bromden reaches the day room. 
INT. DAY ROOM - DAY 
as Bromden makes his way across the day room, past the nurses' station, unnoticed by Miss Pilbow who is busy preparing the day's medication. 
Bromden is sliding along the hallway wall, when he is suddenly cut off by a mop which THUDS against one side of his neck. A second mop yokes him on the other side. Bromden freezes. Terrified. 
MILLER Where you goin', Chief? 
WARREN You goin' t'see the Big White Fathuh? 
WASHINGTON He goin' t'see the Big White Muthuh... 
They cackle, legs jiving, as the ammonia stings Bromden's eyes and burns his nose. He tries to twist his head, but Washington jams the mop harder. Bromden freezes, panic spreading across his face. 
WASHINGTON (CONT'D) Haw, look at 'im, big 'nough to eat apples off my head an' he mine me like a baby... 
A KEY is HEARD hitting the lock in the main door. Washington very adroitly releases Bromden, hands him the mop, and turns, along with Warren and Miller, to their duties, as BIG NURSE enters the ward. 
THREE ATTENDANTS (simultaneously, as Big Nurse passes) Mornin', Miss Ratched... 
BIG NURSE Good morning, boys. 
She sweeps by and disappears into the nurses' station. The three attendants put their mops and rags aside and start towards the men's dorm, leaving Bromden pressed against the wall, mop in hand. 
INT. NURSES' STATION 
as Big Nurse enters to be greeted by Miss Pilbow, who wears an enormous cross between her breasts. 
MISS PILBOW Good morning, Miss Ratched. It's a beautiful day, isn't it? 
BIG NURSE Mean old Monday, Miss Pilbow, mean old Monday... (she flips on the intercom) Good morning, boys. Rise and shine. Rise and shine. 
INT. MEN'S DORM - DAY 
as Washington, Warren and Miller roust the patients out of bed. 
BIG NURSE (V.O.) (through loudspeaker) Time to get up! Come on now, it's a beautiful day! Let's not straggle! Everybody up, up, up! 
The Chronics are physically helped out of bed as the Acutes, who can handle themselves, cross out into the Day Room, rubbing the sleep out of their eyes. Big Nurse steps out of the Nurses' Station. Washington and Warren are hustling the patients toward the washroom. 
Miller stays behind, stripping Blastic's bed and rolling up his mattress. 
INT. DAY ROOM - DAY 
as the Acutes straggle past Big Nurse. 
BIG NURSE Good morning, Mister Sefelt... Good morning, Mister Fredrickson. Good morning, Billy, I spoke to your mother last night and she sends her love... Good morning, Mister Harding... Good morning, Mister Cheswick. Mister Scanlon... 
Bromden comes drifting by, going in the opposite direction. Big Nurse takes his hand and reaches up and pats his face. 
BIG NURSE (CONT'D) Oh, Mister Bromden... (calling out) Mister Washington! 
MCMURPHY Sure... 
MARTINI Me too! Me too! 
As McMurphy hands out his cigarettes Bromden drifts by, mop in hand. 
MCMURPHY Hey, how's it look up there, big boy? 
SCANLON He can't hear you. He's just a deaf and dumb Indian! 
MCMURPHY That right? 
HARDING (O.S.) Martini, it's your turn! 
Martini is staring off into space. 
HARDING (O.S.) (CONT'D) Martini! 
MCMURPHY (to Martini) Your buddy is callin' ya. 
Martini crosses back to the card game as Taber returns. 
MCMURPHY What's troubling ya, buddy? 
TABER I want you to write me a letter to my brother for a hundred dollars to bury me. 
MCMURPHY You look pretty healthy to me. 
TABER (CONT'D) I'm the next one. 
MCMURPHY How do ya know that? 
TABER (CONT'D) Because I quit breathing. 
MCMURPHY You're breathin' right now. 
Taber walks away. 
McMurphy watches him go. 
Nearby, an OLD VEGETABLE squeaks. 
MCMURPHY (crossing to him) What's that, Pop? 
The old man squeaks again. 
MCMURPHY (leaning in close) Can't hear ya, old-timer. 
OLD VEGETABLE Ain't this a pisser? 
MCMURPHY Hell, compared to where I just come from, this is a country club. 
McMurphy crosses to the card game and stands watching the game. 
MCMURPHY Whatcha boys playin'? 
BILLY H-H-Hearts. 
MCMURPHY Shoot! No wonder you don't care nothin' 'bout showin' your hand. 
Billy holds his hand close to his chest. 
MCMURPHY What's your name, buddy? 
BILLY B-B-Billy. 
MCMURPHY Well, put 'er there, Billy boy, my name's McMurphy. 
They shake hands. 
MCMURPHY What I wanna know is who's the top loony around here? 
BILLY (CONT'D) Y-Y-You m-mean th-the pr-president of the P-P-Patients C-Council? 
MCMURPHY Yeah, that'll do for openers! 
BILLY (CONT'D) (to Harding) H-H-Harding, the m-m-man w-wants to t-talk to you, y-you're the pr-pr pr... 
HARDING Does he have an appointment? 
CHESWICK Yeah, do you have an appointment? 
MCMURPHY What for? 
CHESWICK (to Harding) What for? 
HARDING I'm a busy man! 
CHESWICK (to McMurphy) He's a busy man! 
A beat; then: 
MCMURPHY I can wait... 
McMurphy picks up a chair and sits down right next to Harding and looks at him. Another beat; then: 
HARDING (to McMurphy) What are you doing? 
MCMURPHY I'm seeing what a busy man does. 
They cross out of the men's dorm. 
Big Nurse watches them go. 
SPIVEY (V.O.) What other work have you done? 
INT. DOCTOR SPIVEY'S OFFICE - DAY 
Doctor Spivey is seated behind his desk, on which are several glass-framed photos of Spivey's family, plus a nameplate: JOHN M. SPIVEY, M.D., and McMurphy's papers. 
McMurphy, freshly showered and wearing hospital-issue clothes, sits facing him. 
MCMURPHY Hell, Doc, I've been everything from a hoopla man with a two-bit carny show to a top mechanic and bull goose catskinner for every gypo loggin' operation in the Northwest till the Army taught me what my natural bent was. 
SPIVEY Oh, what was that? 
MCMURPHY Poker! 
SPIVEY I see. 
MCMURPHY Yeah, but you know how society persecutes a dedicated man. 
SPIVEY (CONT'D) In what way? 
MCMURPHY They say I'm a habitual hassler. Like I fight some. Sheeut. They didn't mind so much when I was a dumb logger and got into a hassle. That's a hardworkin' feller blowing off steam, they say. But if you're a gambler, all you have to do is spit slantwise and you're a goddamned criminal. 
SPIVEY I see... 
MCMURPHY To tell the truth, ever since I found my natural callin' I done time in so many small-time jails I could write a brochure... 
SPIVEY Yes... Ah, do you know why you're here? 
MCMURPHY Well, ya know, Doc... (indicating his papers) Doesn't it say so there? 
SPIVEY (looking over papers) Well, according to the Warden at Pendleton, you were a disturbing influence on others. 'It appears that there is a potential in him for instigating a revolt among the other inmates.' (looking up at McMurphy) What do you think of that report? 
MCMURPHY I don't, Doc... 
SPIVEY (goes back to papers) Arrested on an assault charge five times... 
MCMURPHY That's correct, Doc ... 
SPIVEY (reading from folder) The doctor at the prison states: 'Don't overlook the possibility that this man may be faking psychosis to escape the drudgery of the work farm...' What do you say to that? 
MCMURPHY Doc, what can I tell ya? 
SPIVEY Ah, it seems you have no other psychiatric history, Mister Murphy? 
MCMURPHY No, this is my first trip, Doc. 
SPIVEY (closes folder and sits back) Well, you're here for a ninety-day observation period, Mister McMurphy. I'd like you to understand you are here on a court order and we are responsible to the state. So, I'd like your cooperation! 
MCMURPHY You bet, Doc! 
SPIVEY Good. Good. 
INT. DAY ROOM - DAY 
CAMERA is on Big Nurse as she stands, in front of a chair, doing a deep breathing exercise. 
The patients and staff, standing in front of chairs arranged in a circle, follow suit as best they can. After a couple of exercises Big Nurse sits. The others do the same except Bancini, who remains standing, wagging his head back and forth. 
BANCINI I'm tired. Whew. O Lord. Oh, I'm awful tired... 
BIG NURSE (busy with her papers) Somebody please see to Mister Bancini, so we can start the meeting. 
Billy does... gently laying a hand on Bancini. 
BILLY T-t-t-take it e-e-easy, P-P-P Pete... 
BANCINI Awful tired... 
Billy gently eases Bancini into his chair and sits beside him, patting his skinny knee. 
BIG NURSE At the close of Friday's meeting, we were discussing Mister Harding's problem, concerning his wife... (reading from logbook) Mister Harding stated that his wife made him uneasy because she drew stares from men on the street. Is that correct, Mister Harding? 
HARDING Yes, that's perfectly correct. 
BIG NURSE (reading) He also thinks he may have given her reason to seek sexual attention elsewhere, but he didn't say how. He has been heard to say to his wife, 'I hate you, I don't ever want to see you again. You've betrayed me.' (she closes book) So. Does anyone care to touch upon this further? 
Big Nurse waits. A long beat. 
Harding sits, chewing his nails, tensely waiting, almost wanting someone to begin. 
The patients shift uncomfortably, looking in all directions. 
McMurphy looks around to see what will follow, when he sees Ellis, nailed to the wall; his pants leg darkens and a puddle of piss forms at his feet. McMurphy looks to see if Big Nurse or the Aides have noticed. 
If they have, no one pays any attention. 
McMurphy fidgets in his seat, then gets up, crosses to Ellis, unhooks him from the wall, and moves him over a few feet. 
The other patients are aghast at this move, look at each other quizzically. 
Big Nurse merely watches. 
McMurphy crosses back to his chair and sits. 
BIG NURSE (CONT'D) Mister McMurphy, this ward is a democratic community run by the patients and their votes, so you should feel at ease in your new surroundings to the extent you can freely discuss emotional problems in front of the patients and staff. However, the cardinal rule, and I must emphasize this: Everyone keeps their seat during the meeting! 
HARDING (CONT'D) (his voice rising as he goes on) ... or making me aware of a condition in my life, then I say, categorically speaking, the hell with you, Taber! I don't have to justify the condition of my life to you or any of you. No matter what I will carry on until I fully understand what that function is regardless of the form or content. Regardless of the fact we must try to understand the function of our capacity to obtain, to personify the condition, the condition of our existence, our existence... 
TABER You know what, Harding? I think you're some kind of morbid asshole or something. You've been talking about your wife evere since I can remember. You know, she's on your mind and blah, blah, blah and on and on and when are you going to wise up and turn her loose! 
FREDRICKSON Yeah, wise up, Harding. 
SEFELT Yeah, turn her loose! 
ACUTES (start pouring it on) Yeah, who do you think you are anyway?... He thinks he's God Almighty... He's a snob... He's a schmuck... Dumbbell... Creep... Cretin... Idiot... Get rid of him... Ship him upstairs... 
RUCKLY (chiming in) Ffffffuck da wife... 
BANCINI (wagging his head) Tired... Awful tired... 
ACUTES (not letting up) Zap him... Give 'im lobotomy... Cut his nuts off... He doesn't have any... Fag... Pervert. 
BANCINI (in a strong angry voice) I'm tired! 
Everyone hushes. 
BIG NURSE Somebody see to Mister Bancini. 
Two or three Acutes get up and try to soothe Bancini, but he isn't to be hushed. 
BANCINI Tired. Tired. Oh God, I'm tired... 
Big Nurse nods to Washington, who goes to Pete, and gives his arm a jerk toward the door. Bancini is unmovable. 
Big Nurse signals Nurse Pilbow, who heads for the nurses' station. 
Washington senses danger, lets go of Pete's arm, backs away. 
WASHINGTON You a good boy, Mistah Bancini... 
Nurse Pilbow returns, hypodermic needle in hand. 
Pete turns to his fellow inmates. 
BANCINI You see... it's a lotta baloney... It's all a lotta baloney... 
NURSE PILBOW Yes, yes, Mister Bancini, now if you'll just be calm... 
BANCINI That's all it is, just a lotta baloney. Ya see, I can't help it, can't... 
NURSE PILBOW (working her way around Bancini) Yes, I know, I know... 
She gets him in the ass, with the needle, and springs back. 
BANCINI ... don't ya see. I was born dead. Not you. You wasn't born dead. Ahhh, it's been so hard... (starts going over, slowly; sighing and crying) Tired... I'm tired... aw-ful tired... 
McMurphy looks around at the others. 
Each patient is locked in his own world -- oblivious to Bancini's state. 
EXT. BASKETBALL COURT - DAY 
WIDE SHOT of entire court, surrounded by a high fence topped off with barbed wire, as Washington and Warren escort the Acutes -- including Bromden, Ellis, a lobotomy case and several other Chronics -- through the gate onto the court, which is run down, with cracks in its surface and leaves scattered everywhere. 
Martini, who is carrying the ball, runs ahead, followed by Scanlon, where he starts dribbling the ball in a frantic circle, suddenly passes the ball to nothing. 
MARTINI (as he throws ball) Catch it! Catch it! 
The ball rolls to the corner. 
WASHINGTON Martini, there ain't nobody there, ya dumb goon! Go get the ball! 
MARTINI No! 
Martini turns away, his feelings hurt. Washington goes after the ball, when Martini goes running after it. 
MARTINI (CONT'D) I get it! I get it! 
But Washington gives Martini a body check and beats him to the ball. 
Martini tries to get the ball from Washington, who is quite agile and teases him as he returns to the court where he and Warren start shooting baskets, freezing Martini and Scanlon out. 
The other patients just hang around or walk, as if in a prison yard. 
Cheswick stands in close proximity to McMurphy and Harding, who stand watching the action. McMurphy finally offers a cigarette to Harding, who accepts. They both light up. 
MCMURPHY Well, say, buddy, is that the usual pro-cedure for those Group Ther'py shindigs? Bunch of chickens at a peckin' party? 
HARDING A pecking party? 
MCMURPHY That's right, buddy. And you want to know who pecks the first peck? 
HARDING AND CHESWICK Who? Who? 
MCMURPHY Ah, come off it! It's that Big Nurse, that's who... 
The other Acutes have gathered around McMurphy and Harding. 
HARDING It's as simple as that. You've been on our ward six hours and have already simplified the work of Freud, Jung and Maxwell Jones in one grand analogy: it's a pecking party. 
MCMURPHY I'm not talking about Fred Yoong or Maxwell Jones, buddy, what I'm talkin' about is that crummy meeting and what that nurse did to you! 
HARDING Did to me? 
MCMURPHY Did to you and all the rest of you guys. 
CAMERA HOLDS on McMurphy as he slowly pulls it together and sits on the edge of the bed. He's naked as he opens the drawer to his nightstand and fishes around for a cigarette. 
MCMURPHY (looking in the drawer) What the... (looking around) Who the fuck stole my cigarettes! 
INT. DAY ROOM - DAY 
as the Acutes straggle past Big Nurse. 
BIG NURSE Good morning, Mister Sefelt, are your teeth any better?... Good morning, Mister Fredrickson... Good morning, Mister Harding; my, my, you've been biting your fingernails again... 
She sees McMurphy approaching, wearing a towel around his waist and a scowl on his face. 
BIG NURSE (CONT'D) Mister McMurphy, patients are not permitted to run around in towels. 
MCMURPHY I wanna report a robbery! 
BIG NURSE On this ward? 
MCMURPHY Yeah, some creep stole my cigarettes! 
BIG NURSE Oh, I had them removed. 
MCMURPHY What for? 
BIG NURSE Patients are rationed to one pack of cigarettes a day. 
Bromden comes drifting by, going in the opposite direction. Big Nurse takes his hand. 
BIG NURSE (CONT'D) (calling out) Mister Washington! 
Washington comes running. 
WASHINGTON Yes, Miss Ratched? 
BIG NURSE Please see to Mister Bromden. 
WASHINGTON (taking Bromden by the hand) Yes, Miss Ratched... 
Washington leads Bromden off. Big Nurse turns to Cheswick and several other Acutes, who have crowded around. 
BIG NURSE Now you boys hurry along and wash up for breakfast... (to McMurphy) You too, Mister McMurphy. 
MCMURPHY Well, say. How 'bout springing a pack of cigarettes loose? 
BIG NURSE After breakfast, Mister McMurphy, after breakfast. 
MCMURPHY You sure run a tight-assed ship 'round here, don't ya! 
BIG NURSE Yes. Now run along like a good boy and see that you wash up properly. 
WIDER ANGLE 
A beat, as the Acutes wait for McMurphy's next move, then: 
MCMURPHY 'Kay, let's go brush our teeth, fellas... 
McMurphy turns and crosses toward the washroom, singing at the top of his lungs. 
MCMURPHY Oh, Lulu had a baby, His name was Sunny Jim, She put 'im in a piss pot, To teach 'im how to swim. Oh, he swam to the bottom, He swam to the top, Lulu got excited, An' pulled 'im by his... Cock-tail ginger-ale, Five cents a glass, An' if ya don't like it Ya can shove it up your... Ask me no more questions, I'll tell ya no more lies. 
BIG NURSE 
watching McMurphy who removes his towel as he enters the washroom. 
INT. WASHROOM - DAY 
as McMurphy enters to see Warren take a firm grip on Bromaen's head and Washington goes to work on Bromden's face. CAMERA PUSHES INTO EXTREME CLOSEUP of Bromden's fearfully distorted face as the BUZZING SOUND of the ELECTRIC RAZOR INTENSIFIES until it is INSUPPORTABLE. 
INT. MESS HALL - DAY 
We SEE the attendants spooning food into the sucking pink mouths of the vegetables, a shade too fast for swallowing. 
MCMURPHY (O.S.) What's wrong with you guys? 
We SEE McMurphy seated with the Acutes, shoveling food down his guillet. The others are barely touching their food. 
MCMURPHY Why, if I'd have known how soft this place was gonna be, I'd have arranged for my transfer sooner... (holding up his orange juice) Look at this here, real orange juice! (slugging it down) Hooee, that's good. Why, you couldn't pay me to leave this place! (slaps his belly) All this place lacks is a couple of sweet gals to liven things up... 
He gets up and carries his tray to the proper place, where he notices Miller loading several other trays onto a dumbwaiter. Miller pushes a button and the dumbwaiter goes down. McMurphy crosses to the door to find it blocked by Washington. 
MCMURPHY Stand aside, Sam, Nature's callin'. 
WASHINGTON Nobody leaves here till seven thirty. 
McMurphy turns Washington over in his mind, then he looks up at the clock above the door. 
The time is 7:28. The second hand sweeping its way toward 
MCMURPHY Don't know if I can hold it that long, Sam. 
WASHINGTON (CONT'D) Tha's your problem. 
MCMURPHY (confidentially) Who do you like in the opening game, Sam? 
WASHINGTON (CONT'D) Huh? 
MCMURPHY (turning away) Asshole. 
McMurphy turns and walks away. 
Several Acutes look at them. 
Scanlon and Martini's hands go down. 
McMurphy can't believe his eyes. 
BIG NURSE (CONT'D) (politely) I count only two, including you, Mister McMurphy. Certainly not enough to change ward policy. 
McMurphy's hand goes down. 
BIG NURSE (CONT'D) Yes. Now was there anything else you wanted to discuss, Mister McMurphy? 
MCMURPHY No way. 
CHESWICK No way. 
McMurphy starts tearing his sheet of paper up into a thousand pieces. 
BIG NURSE (checking her watch) Then I suggest we turn our attention back to Mister Harding's problem. Would anybody care to begin? 
She looks around. 
McMurphy is slouched in his chair. 
Harding puts his hands up. No one else does. 
BIG NURSE (CONT'D) Yes, Mister Harding? 
HARDING Yes, thank you, Miss Ratched. Since our last meeting I have been reflecting, quite seriously, on the nature of my problem. Naturally, I'm referring to the capacity to obtain the necessary results in order to obtain... No, no. To personify the very existence of that relationship regardless of the function... (he stops, chews his lip, then continues) Regardless of the function, we will confront the question of... Yes. Yes. The question of... Existence... Relationship... Function... Confront... Yes, confronting us in the moment of deepest crisis... Yes, the crisis of our souls. Of our souls, which I am trying to fully understand the problem... the problem. Not to shut ourselves off, but somehow... Somehow to understand fully our capacity... to obtain... to personify... the question... existence depends... depends on the question... to reflect... to reflect... 
Harding, breaks off, sweating; he begins to knead his forehead and chew his nails. 
HARDING (CONT'D) To reflect... 
ANGLE 
Silence as the CAMERA REFLECTS: the room, the patients, the staff, the hallways, the hospital, the grounds, the trees, the sky, ending on. 
MARTINI (V.O.) Hold it a minute. What's a man need to buy thum hotels? 
INT. TUB ROOM - NIGHT 
Bromden is pressed against the wall, watching McMurphy, Martini, Scanlon and Cheswick play a game of monopoly. The others are playing cards or just hanging around, a little chagrined. Billy is most disturbed by this separation. 
MCMURPHY You need four houses on every lot of the same color, Martini. Now let's go, for Christsakes. 
MARTINI Hold it a minute. 
There's a flurry of money from Martini, red, green and yellow bills blowing in every direction. 
CHESWICK Let's go, for Christsakes... 
MCMURPHY It's your dirty roll, Cheswick. 
Cheswick rolls the dice. 
MCMURPHY Snake eyes! Hoooeee, that puts you on my Marvin Gardens, which means you owe me three hundred and fifty dollars. 
Cheswick starts counting out the money. 
MARTINI What's thum other things? Hold it a minute. What's thum other things all over the board? 
CHESWICK (to Martini) How can a man concentrate with you sitting there hallucinating a mile a minute... 
MCMURPHY You just come on with that three fifty and Martini will take care of himself... Your dice, Scanlon. 
SCANLON Gimme those dice. I'll blow this board to pieces. Here we go... (throws the dice) Lebenty leben, count me over eleven, Martini... 
Martini picks up a house... 
SCANLON (CONT'D) Not that one, you crazy bastard, that's my house... 
Scanlon grabs Martini's hand and tries to get his piece back. Martini won't let go. 
MCMURPHY Break it up, God dammit! Ain't I got enough troubles without you guys messin' around... can't depend on nobody. 
BILLY (from the next table) Some of us ha-ha-have b-b-been here a long t-t-time, Randle, and will b b-be here long after this Wo-Wo World Series of yours is oh-oh-oh, what's the use anyway... 
McMurphy slams his fist down on the table, sending the monopoly pieces flying. Martini is crestfallen. 
MCMURPHY What's the use! Hooee! It'd do you birds some good just to get a little exercise lifting your arms to vote! 
HARDING A baseball game isn't worth the risk, my friend. 
MCMURPHY It is to me! An' if I hafta bust way outta this place to see it, I will! 
CHESWICK Right! 
FREDRICKSON Oh, yeah? 
MCMURPHY Yeah! 
SEFELT Big man! 
MCMURPHY Yeah, how much you wanna bet? 
SEFELT On what? 
MCMURPHY That me an' my buddy, Cheswick, we'll be downtown tomorrow watchin' the ballgame while you suckers are sittin' around this goddamn nursery! 
looking at the machine. A long beat. 
INT. MEN'S DORM - NIGHT 
The patients are getting ready for bed when Billy approaches McMurpby, who is in bed. 
BILLY M-M-Mack... 
McMurphy turns away from Billy, who crosses to the other side of the bed. 
BILLY (CONT'D) M-M-Mack, I-I-I'm sorry! 
HARDING Leave him alone, he's pouting. 
BILLY Y-Y-Y-You leave him alone! 
MCMURPHY That's okay, kid... 
BILLY Th-th-then y-y-you're n-n-not m-m mad? 
MCMURPHY No, kid, it was my own stupidity, that's what pissed me off. 
BILLY O-o-o-oh... 
MCMURPHY What we're gonna have to do is pull this ballclub together for our next play. 'Kay! 
BILLY 'K-k-kay, Mack! 
INT. HALLWAY - DAY 
Washington, Warren and Miller are at the end of the hallway, listening to a small RADIO. We can HEAR the SPORTS ANNOUNCER giving the line-up for the opening game of the World Series. 
WASHINGTON'S POV Way down the hall, the Group Meeting is SEEN in progress. 
INT. DAY ROOM - DAY 
A Group Meeting is in progress and Big Nurse is honed in on Billy. 
BIG NURSE Try, Billy, try... 
Billy tries, but can't talk. 
The other Acutes are bored, restive, waiting. 
McMurphy has ants in his pants as Big Nurse speaks to Billy. 
BIG NURSE (CONT'D) Was it your idea to visit her on Sunday? 
BILLY Y-y-y-yes... 
BIG NURSE Tell us about it... 
BILLY I-I-I-I c-c-c-came over S-S-S Sunday m-m-m-morning after ch-ch-ch church and br-br-brought her s-s some flowers, and I s-s-said, I said, 'C-C-C-Celia, will you muh muh-muh-muh-muh...' till the girl broke out l-l-laughing. 
Billy laughs at himself. 
BIG NURSE What was it about her that disturbed you so, Billy? 
BILLY (rubbing scars on his wrist) I was in luh-love with her. 
BIG NURSE Billy, were you afraid of her, or of her love? 
No response from Billy. 
BIG NURSE (CONT'D) That was the first time you attempted to commit suicide, wasn't it? (no response) You must try to talk about it, Billy. 
MCMURPHY Jesus Christ, the man doesn't want to talk, so get off his back an' let's get on to some new business. 
BIG NURSE Mister McMurphy, the purpose of this meeting is therapy. Group therapy. 
MCMURPHY Yeah, yeah, the hell with that crap! The World Series is goin' on right' now an' that's therapy also! 
BIG NURSE Let me pose a question to the group: do any of you feel that Mister McMurphy is perhaps imposing his personal desires on you too much? 
MCMURPHY What the hell does that have to do with it? This is an important event and I want a vote on it! 
CHESWICK Yeah, let's vote on it! 
BIG NURSE Will one more vote satisfy you? 
MCMURPHY Yeah, it'll satisfy me. 
BIG NURSE Very well. What is it you're proposing, Mister McMurphy? 
MCMURPHY I'm proposing a re-vote on watchin' the ballgame! 
BIG NURSE (to the patients) A vote is before the group. 
MCMURPHY Okay, I wanna see the hands. I wanna see which of you birds has any guts. 
BIG NURSE Everyone in favor of changing the schedule raise his hand. 
The first hand to come up is Cheswick's. Then McMurphy's. Then Martini, Scanlon, Sefelt, Fredrickson, Billy and Taber. 
Harding doesn't vote. 
Big Nurse starts counting the hands. 
McMurphy, his face beaming, counts the hands. 
McMurphy sits facing him. 
SPIVEY How are you feeling? 
MCMURPHY Just fine, Doc... In fact, I think I might've put on a couple of pounds since I got here. 
SPIVEY Good, good, and how are you getting along on the ward? 
MCMURPHY Come on, Doc, you know as well as I do what's been comin' down in that loony bin. 
SPIVEY Yes, well, Miss Ratched feels that you're a disturbing influence on the other patients. 
MCMURPHY Shoot, Doc, the only one I'm disturbing is that old nurse and her fixed ways. That's all. 
SPIVEY Yes, that may be so, but in making a careful study of your past record, along with your behavior since you arrived here, my feeling is that you are not mentally ill and it is going to be my recommendation that you be returned to Pendleton where they are better equipped to handle your case. 
This is the kiss of death to McMurphy. 
MCMURPHY Come on, Doc, you must be kiddin'. 
SPIVEY I'm afraid not. 
MCMURPHY Jesus, that old nurse sure wants my ass in a sling, don't she! 
SPIVEY No, Mister McMurphy, it's just that we cannot offer you the guidance and assistance that you would receive at Pendleton. 
MCMURPHY Guidance and assistance! That's insane! Doc, ya gotta help me. 
SPIVEY I'm sorry, but I can't keep you here. 
MCMURPHY When? 
SPIVEY We'll let you know. 
REACTION SHOT of McMurphy. 
EXT. BASKETBALL COURT - DAY 
Washington and Warren are sitting on the grass watching Martini, Scanlon, Harding and Billy, who are positioned on the court waiting on McMurphy who is under the board with Bromden. 
Cheswick and the other patients hang around off court as: 
MCMURPHY (with great physical and vocal emphasis throughout entire scene) Okay, Chief. This is your spot! I don't want you to move from this spot! Never!... 'Kay, now, take the ball! Raise your hands, like this... 
McMurphy raises his hands above his head. Bromden follows suit. 
MCMURPHY That's good! That's a good boy, Chief! Now jump and put it in! 
McMurphy jumps. Bromden doesn't. McMurphy does this a couple of times. Each time Bromden remains motionless. 
HARDING He can't hear you! 
MCMURPHY I know, goddammit! You don't have ta tell me that! 
HARDING So why are you talking to him? 
MCMURPHY I'm not talkin' to him! I'm talkin' to myself! It helps me think! 
HARDING It doesn't help him. 
MCMURPHY Well, it doesn't hurt him either! (turning to Bromden) Does it, Chief! (no response) See, it doesn't hurt him. (to Bromden) Jump! An' put it in! 
McMurphy jumps. Bromden doesn't move. 
HARDING Well, I think you're just confusing him... 
Bromden jumps. 
MCMURPHY Ha! Did ya see that! (calling to Cheswick on the sidelines) Hey, Cheswick! 
CHESWICK Yeah, Mack? 
MCMURPHY Come here! 
Cheswick runs over. 
CHESWICK Yeah, Mack? 
MCMURPHY Let me get on your shoulders. 
CHESWICK Sure, Mack... 
McMurphy climbs on his shoulders. 
MCMURPHY 'Kay, wheel me around to the basket... 'Kay, easy, easy. Hold it! 'Kay, now. (he sees Bromden has walked away) Hey, Chief, come back! 
Bromden doesn't hear. 
MCMURPHY Cheswick, go get 'im! 
Cheswick goes after Bromden, catches him, and McMurphy latches onto him. 
MCMURPHY Now, wheel me to the basket. 
Cheswick, straining under the weight of McMurphy, turns toward the basket. 
INT. MEN'S DORM - NIGHT 
as Bromden, chewing his gum, watches McMurphy ease his way out of bed and silently cross down the aisle, past the sleep patients, toward the day room. 
CHESWICK How ya gettin' out, Mac?

TABER Bullshit. You ain't got no way out! 
MCMURPHY Oh, yeah?

MCMURPHY Shhh! 
INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT 
The patients are waiting in the tunnel, which is used as an underground connecting system to the institutional buildings, as McMurphy gets out of the dumbwaiter. 
MCMURPHY (looking around) Where's Martini and Scanlon? 
CHESWICK (pointing) They went that way. 
MCMURPHY Charlie, ya can't ever let those goons outta ya sight! Understand! 
CHESWICK Right, Mack! 
Far down the tunnel Martini and Scanlon are briefly SEEN as they skitter across the tunnel. 
SEFELT There they are! 
MCMURPHY Hey, Martini! Psst! Scanlon! Ya dumb goons, come back here! (starting after them) Come on, let's get 'em! 
McMurphy starts down the tunnel. The others don't move. 
MCMURPHY (calling back) Come on, you guys, let's stick together. 
The Acutes follow McMurphy. They run down to the intersection and turn the corner. 
No sign of Martini or Scanlon. 
Somewhere a DOOR is HEARD SLAMMING CLOSED and FOOTSTEPS are HEARD coming their way. 
EXT. INSTITUTIONAL GROUNDS - ANOTHER ANGLE - NIGHT 
As the bus makes a full circle and stops alongside of Bromden. 
MCMURPHY (waving Bromden onto the bus) Come on, Chief! Let's go!

DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. DEPOE BAY - DAWN 
The dawn is just cracking the horizon as the bus pulls up behind a corroded tin sheet building. A sign reads: 
DEPOE BAY, SEAMANIS SERVICE, SPORT FISHING, BOATS FOR CHARTER 
Beyond the boathouse is the dock with several fishing trawlers and beyond that -- the open sea. 
The door to the bus opens and McMurphy gets out. 
MCMURPHY (as he steps out of the bus) This is it! 
as McMurphy walks directly to the wall, alongside the door, lifts the edge of the siding, comes up with a key, opens the door and enters. 
A beat, then the lights go on inside the building. 
SHOT OF BUS 
The Acutes' faces pressed against the windows, looking out. 
INT. SEAMAN'S BUILDING - DAWN 
as McMurphy lifts a cold bottle of beer out of a Coca-Cola cooler, opens it, takes a long pull on the bottle, then crosses to the heater and turns it on. 
Nearby, a sign reads: ALL EQUIPMENT CAN BE RENTED 
On the walls are old photographs of people with their prize catches. Fishing equipment, tackle and wet weather gear crowd the room. 
There is a counter which McMurphy walks behind and takes a bag of potato chips off a wall rack, full of beer nuts, hostess cupcakes, etc. 
McMurphy eyes the keyboard to the fishing boats. Several keys are there. 
INSERT - KEYBOARD 
with the names of the fishing boats: The Lark. Mary Ann. Noel. Annabella. The Capri. 
INT. BUILDING DEPOE BAY - DAWN 
BILLY (calling) M-M-Mack! M-M-Mack! 
McMurphy pulls himself up. 
MCMURPHY What is it, kid? 
BILLY C-C-Come here and l-look at th this! 
McMurphy crosses down and looks over the side. 
MCMURPHY He's a big flounder. Could weigh two, three hundred. You got to lift him in with a winch. 
FREDRICKSON Does that mean we have to cut him loose? 
MCMURPHY Like hell we will! We got the muscle standing right here. All we need is a couple gaffin' hooks and some rope. 
BILLY I-I-I'll get them. 
MARTINI Me, too. 
SCANLON Me, too. 
McMurphy turns to Sefelt who is sweating under the strain. 
MCMURPHY Steady does it, Sefelt! 
SEFELT'S POV 
The massive fish is closer to the surface. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
BACK TO SCENE 
All the men are standing by as gaffing hooks and rope are made ready. The fish is gaffed and slowly hauled out of the water. 
McMurphy and Bromden lean over, held by the others, grab the big fish by its gills and, with a heave-ho, the fish is slid in and flopped to the bottom of the boat. The men go sprawling over the big fish. There's a lot of laughter, handshakes and back-slapping going on when -- 
VOICE (over bull horn) All right! Stand to! Stand to! 
The men look up. 
REVERSE SHOT - ACUTES' POV 
Off the bow is a Coast Guard cutter, and on the deck stands Doctor Spivey, Washington, Warren and several other aides dressed in white. 
INT. HALLWAY - STATE HOSPITAL - LATE AFTERNOON 
as the Acutes, sunburned and covered with dried brine and fish scales, are escorted down the hallway by Washington, Warren and Doctor Spivey. 
It's a triumphant procession as they wheel the giant flounder with a sheet over it on a gurney, holding up their catches for all to see. 
McMurphy is lagging a bit behind as they pass the mess hall where workmen are busy installing a security screen over the transom, while inside the mess hall another workman is SEEN welding a lock on the dumbwaiter. 
INT. DAY ROOM 
as Big Nurse steps out of the Nurses' Station. 
SPIVEY (to Big Nurse) Here they are, Miss Ratched. Safe and sound! 
BIG NURSE Good. Well, boys, did you enjoy yourselves? 
A burst of exuberance as the inmates hold up their fish. 
FREDRICKSON (to Sefelt) Show her the one you caught, Jim. 
Sefelt whips the sheet off the big fish. 
BIG NURSE My, my... 
No one can find superlatives or gestures big enough to describe his catching of the big fish, "brought it in himself" AD LIB. 
MCMURPHY Yeah, ya should've come along with us, Miss Ratched, an' gotten a little sun on your cheeks and maybe caught a fish or two. 
BIG NURSE Mr. McMurphy, you had no right to take these men out with you! 
MCMURPHY (loudly) Yeah, that's kind of crazy, ain't it! 
BIG NURSE No, it was irresponsible! 
Big Nurse turns to the others, leaving McMurphy dangling. 
BIG NURSE (CONT'D) (respectfully) That's quite a catch, Jim. Whaat are you going to do with it? 
MARTINI (crossing to McMurphy) Gimme a cigarette! 
SEFELT I thought I might donate it to the mess hall. 
MCMURPHY (reaches in his pocket; he has none) I don't have any. 
AD LIBS: "They could use it." "Take a picture first." 
BIG NURSE (CONT'D) That's an excellent idea. Now, why don't you boys place your fish on the gurney and we'll see to it that everyone enjoys a fresh fish dinner. 
The men toss their fish on the gurney as Martini joins the group and starts hitting the others up for a cigarette. All he gets for his troubles are a series of "No," "Get lost," "I don't have any." 
BIG NURSE (CONT'D) Thank you, boys. Now if you'll just go along with Mister Washington to the showers, supper is in half an hour. 
The inmates start AD LIBBING and laughing, "We're not hungry," as Martini sees Harding light up a cigarette and crosses to him. 
BROMDEN Thank you. 
Another beat. 
MCMURPHY Say... God Bless America! 
BROMDEN God Bless America. 
MCMURPHY (slapping his thigh) Goddammit, you sly son-of-a-bitch! Does anybody else know? 
BROMDEN No. 
MCMURPHY Shit! This is too much! (his mind going a mile a minute) Chief, I tell you we're gonna bust outta this place an' make it all the way to Canada before they know what bit 'em. 
BROMDEN Ca-na-da... 
MCMURPHY Ya like that, Chief, huh? 
BROMDEN Yeah... 
MCMURPHY Yeah, well, well, well. 'Bout time the rest of the world got a gander at Big Chief Bromden cuttin' down the boulevard, stopping just long enough for virgins... Oh, man, I tell you, I tell you, you'll have women trippin' you and beating you to the floor... 
BROMDEN Ca-na-da... 
MCMURPHY Shhh, Chief, don't talk. Never talk! Remember, this is just between you an' me. Do ya understand? 
Bromden nods. 
NURSE ITSU (O.S.) Mister McMurphy. 
McMurphy turns to see Nurse Itsu. The two aides are standing behind her. 
MCMURPHY (recognizing a long-lost friend) Hey, how ya doin'? 
NURSE ITSU Fine, thank you. (offering pills) Here, please take these. 
MCMURPHY What are they? 
NURSE ITSU To help you relax... please... 
McMurphy takes the pills and downs them. Bromden takes his pills. 
NURSE ITSU (CONT'D) Please take off your shoes. 
McMurphy takes off his shoes. 
NURSE ITSU (CONT'D) Please follow me. 
MCMURPHY (rising, thumbs up) You an' me, Chief. 
McMurphy, flanked by the two aides, follows Nurse Itsu to the EST room. 
MCMURPHY (to Itsu) You know, I never got your name. 
NURSE ITSU (stopping at the door) Miss Itsu. (indicating the room) In here, please. 
MCMURPHY You comin' in to hold my hand? 
NURSE ITSU No... 
MCMURPHY Yeah... Well, see ya around, Itsu. 
Itsu smiles at McMurphy. 
MCMURPHY Yeah... 
McMurphy gives Bromden one last wave and goes in. 
Bromden watches the door close behind McMurphy. 
INT. EST ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON 
There are four other aides in there, standing around an empty gurney. 
A DOCTOR is at the head of the gurney, a NURSE alongside of him. 
MCMURPHY (as he enters) Hi... 
McMurphy looks around at the six aides. 
MCMURPHY You boys can take a cigarette break now... 
The Nurse smiles at him. 
DOCTOR That's all right, Mister McMurphy, just climb on the bed and lie down... 
MCMURPHY Whatever you say, Doc... 
McMurphy climbs on the bed and lies down. 
The Doctor moves around to the side of the bed and takes McMurphy's pulse, while the Nurse dips her fingers into a jar of salve. 
DOCTOR (to McMurphy) This won't hurt you at all... 
MCMURPHY Uh, uh... 
The Nurse starts applying salve to McMurphy's temples. 
MCMURPHY What's that for? 
McMurphy gets up and crosses to the window, where he joins Bromden who is looking out the window. 
REACTION SHOT of the others as they look at McMurphy and each other with quizzical looks. 
INT. GYMNASIUM - DAY 
On the court both teams are lined up taking photographs for the local newspaper. The bulb pops a few times. 
PHOTOGRAPHER (wrapping it up) Thank you, boys. 
The line breaks up. McMurphy crosses to Big Nurse, who sits in the front row. 
It's the big Saturday game between the Acutes and Aides, as spectators enter the gymnasium already half-filled with male and female patients, staff members and visitors. 
Doctor Spivey stands nearby at the timers' table, basketball in hand, whistle around his neck, talking to the timer. 
MCMURPHY Miss Ratched, would you please save a space for my aunt? She's comin' down from Portland. 
BIG NURSE Certainly, Mister McMurphy, with pleasure. 
MCMURPHY Thank you, ma'am... 
O.S. the WHISTLE BLOWS. 
MCMURPHY Gotta go now, ma'am... 
BIG NURSE Yes. Good luck, Mister McMurphy. 
MCMURPHY Thank you, ma'am. 
McMurphy crosses onto the court. Big Nurse watches him go. 
BASKETBALL COURT 
Doctor Spivey is at half-court, basketball in hand as the players take up their positions: Washington faces McMurphy for the jump at center. Harding and Billy are playing guard with Warren and Miller on them. Martini and Scanlon are in the forward position, with the two white Aides covering them. The other Acutes sit on the bench as substitutes. 
MCMURPHY (to Washington) Hey, Sam, bet ya two bucks ya lose. 
WASHINGTON Shit, man, tha' ain't even worth considerin'. 
MCMURPHY How 'bout twenty? 
WASHINGTON Now you talkin'. 
MCMURPHY Bet! 
WASHINGTON Bet you ass... 
MCMURPHY (to Spivey) You're a witness, Doc! 
SPIVEY Me? I didn't hear a thing! Let's play ball! 
Spivey checks the court, then blows the whistle as he tosses the ball into the air. 
Washington taps the ball to Warren, who passes to Miller, who hands off to Washington, who goes up for a layup. Two points. The Acutes haven't even moved from their spots. The scoreboard reads: AIDES 2 PATIENTS 0. 
MCMURPHY (taking the ball out) Come on, wake up, you ding-a-lings. The game is on. 
The Acutes snap to and McMurphy passes the ball into Harding, who fiercely dribbles down court, McMurphy running alongside him. 
MCMURPHY Pass the ball, Harding... (no pass) Don't hang onto it... (no response) Pass it, goddammit! 
Harding dribbles into the corner and finds himself bottled in by two Aides. 
MCMURPHY Harding, here, over here! 
The ball is snagged from Harding's hands by an Aide, who passes it down court to another Aide, who turns and makes another basket. 
Scoreboard: AIDES 4 PATIENTS 0 
MCMURPHY (to Harding) Ya deaf! I said pass the ball! 
HARDING What are you talking about??? Everybody was covered!!! Everybody was covered!!! 
MCMURPHY I was open! Come on, let's play ball! 
McMurphy and Harding turn to see Martini, down court, passing the ball into Billy. 
WASHINGTON (slapping his hands) Gimme tha' ball! 
Billy panics and hands the ball to Washington, who turns around and makes another basket. Score: AIDES 6 PATIENTS 0. 
McMurphy and Harding run down court, McMurphy taking the ball away from Martini, who would like to bring it in. 
MCMURPHY (to Washington) What kind of crap is that??? 
WASHINGTON (CONT'D) Jus' playin' the game, sucker... 
Washington chuckles and trots on down court. 
MCMURPHY (to Martini) Get down there where ya belong, Martini. You, too, Scanlon. (tosses ball to Harding) You take it out, Harding! 
Harding takes the ball and passes it in to McMurphy, who turns and dribbles down court exactly like Harding did. 
HARDING (running alongside McMurphy) Pass the ball! (no response) Pass it! (no response) Pass it! Pass it! I'm open, McMurphy, pass the ball! 
McMurphy stops dead in his tracks and flings the ball at Harding. The ball bounces off Harding's head and goes out of bounds. The WHISTLE BLOWS. Harding spins a few times. 
MCMURPHY (O.S.) Harding, get back here! 
McMurphy sticks his head out the window. 
CANDY AND ROSE (both slightly tipsy) Hiya, Mack. 
MCMURPHY Hiya, girls... 
TURKLE Shhh... 
Candy passes a heavy bag of bottles in. Then McMurphy and Turkle help her in. Her dress is above her thighs, her ass visible as she swings over the windowsill and into McMurphy's arms. 
CANDY Whew! Made it! 
MCMURPHY (embracing Candy) Man, you look good 'nough to eat! 
CANDY Yeah, well you look like hell warmed over... 
ROSE (O.S.) Hey, pssst! Whadda 'bout me? 
Turkle turns to help Rose in, but she's not as easy to handle, being a good deal heavier and twice as plastered as Candy. 
TURKLE Hey, Mac! Gimme a hand, will ya! 
McMurphy disengages himself from Candy and lends Turkle a hand. Rose is finally hauled into the room. 
ROSE (giggling; loud) Whew! Hiya, boys! 
TURKLE Shhh... let's move it away from the window... 
The group shifts a few feet as Turkle closes the window and locks the screen. McMurphy turns back to Candy. 
MCMURPHY (arms open) Come here, sugar... 
Candy moves into McMurphy's arms as Rose, straightening her dress, turns to see Bromden looming. Rose SCREAMS. 
TURKLE What happened? 
ROSE (backing into Turkle) What's that? 
TURKLE (mystified) What? 
ROSE (pointing at Bromden) That! 
TURKLE Oh, that. That ain't nothin' to be afraid of, ma'am. Just ol Chief Bromden. That's all... 
ROSE Is he one of the loonies? 
MCMURPHY He's a patient, Rose... 
ROSE Oh, yeah... 
MCMURPHY Yeah... 
ROSE (approaching Bromden tentatively) Hi ya, big boy? How's it goin'? Like it in here? 
MCMURPHY He can't hear you, Rose. He's just a big deaf an' dumb indian... 
CANDY Pssst! Hey Rose! There they are! 
ROSE (looking around) What? Where? 
CANDY points to the patients sleeping in the men's dorm. 
CANDY In there. 
ROSE Wow! They're so quiet. 
TURKLE They're sleeping, Miss. They're sleeping. An' we gotta keep it down so we don't disturb their sleep. 
ROSE Are they dangerous when they're awake? 
TURKLE Oh, no, Miss. Not these loonies. These are nice guys. Nice guys. 
CANDY What's that smell? 
TURKLE What smell? 
CANDY Smells weird. Smells like pneumonia. 
TURKLE Ammonia, Miss... 
ROSE Smells like piss. Is this real, Candy? Is this really real? I mean we are in an insane asylum, an' I wanna know how we got ourselves into this scene. 
TURKLE Shhh, please, Miss. Keep it down... 
Rose turns to McMurphy who has opened a bottle of booze and is taking a long pull. 
ROSE (to McMurphy) Who is he? 
MCMURPHY (passing the bottle to Turkle) He's in charge. 
ROSE Are you a doctor? 
TURKLE (passing the bottle to Rose) Not exactly, Miss. Not exactly. 
ROSE (drinking and passing the bottle to Candy) Yeah, well, I'll tell ya somethin'. I'll tell ya somethin'. I had this boyfriend, Chuck. (to McMurphy) Ya know him, Mac. Ya remember, Chuck. 
MCMURPHY Sure, I know Chuck. I know him. 
ROSE Well, listen to this. He got mad at me one day. Boy, did he get mad at me. He took the light bulb, ya know. I thought he was going to cram it right up me, ya know. But he ate it. He ate the whole fucking light bulb. (to Turkle) Now, tell me! Is he crazy? Tell me! Is he crazy? 
INT. DAY ROOM - NIGHT 
MUSIC OVER as the patients are queued up at the nurses' station where Candy is handing out cups full of whiskey, McMurphy backing her up, pouring the booze into the cups. Harding takes his cup and moves back into the day room as Ellis automatically downs the booze, gags and goes spinning off across the hallway and is nailed to the wall. 
QUICK CUT TO: 
DOWN THE HALL - TURKLE 
sticks his head out the door to check the scene out. Sees what's happening and comes rushing down the hallway, without his shirt, and zipping up his pants. 
INT. NURSES' STATION - NIGHT 
as Turkle shoves his way to the intercom system and switches off the lights and music. 
TURKLE (furiously pushing them out) You crazy goons... shut up an' get outta here... Out! Out! Out! 
INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Silence as the last man is driven out of the nurses' station. 
Down the hallway, a light goes on in the visitors' room. 
TURKLE Shit, it's the soo-per-visor come to fire my black ass. 
A KEY is HEARD hitting the lock at the end of the hallway. Without losing a beat, Turkle reverses his movement and starts pushing everybody back into the nurses' station. 
TURKLE (CONT'D) (pushing) Get back in there! In! In! In! 
As Turkle pushes the last man into the nurses' station, he sees Rose stick her head out of the seclusion room. 
TURKLE (CONT'D) (motioning and shouting) Stay in there! Stay in there! 
Rose ducks back into the seclusion room as, simultaneously, Turkle closes the door behind him to the nurses' station as the door to the ward opens and the NIGHT SUPERVISOR, a middle aged woman, enters the ward. 
INT. NURSES' STATION - NIGHT 
as Turkle, shushing the crowd, makes his way to the nurses' lounge and opens the door. 
TURKLE (harsh whisper) Alla ya goons, get in here! 
The patients pile into the nurses' lounge, Turkle cramming the last one through the door and closing it. He turns and crosses to the side door and steps out. 
INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT 
as Turkle steps out of the nurses' station, closing the door behind him. 
NIGHT SUPERVISOR Oh, there you are, Mister Turkle. 
TURKLE Evenin', ma'am. 
NIGHT SUPERVISOR Is everything all right? 
TURKLE (blocking her way to the day room) Why, sure, ma'am... 
NIGHT SUPERVISOR The lights were flashing on and off, Mister Turkle. 
TURKLE Jus' cleanin' up, ma'am. 
NIGHT SUPERVISOR At this hour? 
TURKLE Cleanliness is a twenty-four-hour job, ma'am... 
Harding passes by and enters the latrine. 
NIGHT SUPERVISOR What are these men doing up wandering around? 
TURKLE (leaning in) Ah guess the natives are restless, ma'am... 
NIGHT SUPERVISOR (getting a whiff of his breath) You've been drinking on the job again, haven't you, Mister Turkle! 
TURKLE Ah, no, ma'am... well, yes, ma'am... (leaning in close) A man get awful lonely at night, if ya know what Ah mean, ma'am... 
Down the hall, Rose sticks her head out the door, sees what's happening, and ducks back in as the Night Supervisor turns on her heel and starts back down the hallway, Turkle at her heels. 
NIGHT SUPERVISOR I want those men put back to bed, Mister Turkle! 
TURKLE Yes, ma'am... 
NIGHT SUPERVISOR And you haven't heard the last of this! 
TURKLE Yes, ma'am... 
She opens the gate, slams it behind her, crosses to the main door, opers it and exits to: 
TURKLE (CONT'D) (calling after her) Night, night. 
Turkle turns and the smile leaves his face as he hurries down the hallway. 
O.S. the TOILET FLUSHES as Turkle stops at the seclusion room and sticks his head in. 
TURKLE (CONT'D) Be right back, honey... 
Turkle closes the door, crosses down to the nurses' station, and enters as Harding comes out of the latrine. 
INT. NURSES' STATION - NIGHT 
as Turkle enters, crosses to the nurses' lounge and opens the door to see the patients, silhouetted against the open refrigerator light, moving around, pulling the room apart. It smacks of Dante's Inferno as Turkle snaps on the light and steps into the room. 
INT. NURSES' LOUNGE - NIGHT 
BILLY C-C-Candy, wu-wu-will y-y-you mu-mu marry me! 
CANDY Ah, Billy... 
Candy rises, kisses Billy on the cheek, and dances with him. 
McMurphy beams on the twosome, unscrews his whiskey bottle, takes a long pull on the juice, and looks at Bromden. 
Bromden sits by the window waiting. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. DAY ROOM - NIGHT 
as the MUSIC ENDS. A long silence, then another NUMBER begins as McMurphy, who has nodded off, starts awake and looks around. 
McMURPHY'S POV 
Bromden sits by the window waiting. 
Cheswick is asleep on the table. 
Martini and Scanlon are sitting in their wheelchairs filling their cups from through the enema tube. 
Harding sits, maintaining his aloofness, smoking a cigarette. 
Sefelt is sitting on the floor, in a drunken stupor, while Fredrickson dances around him. 
Candy and Billy stand, locked in each other's arms, swaying to the MUSIC. 
McMURPHY 
struggles to his feet, steadies himself, crosses to the nurses' station. 
INT. NURSES' LOUNGE - NIGHT 
as McMurphy enters and goes to Turkle, who is dead asleep. McMurphy lifts Turkle's keys and leaves. 
INT. DAY ROOM - NIGHT 
as McMurphy crosses to Billy and Candy, and gently parting them, he puts his arms around them -- as much for support as affection. 
MCMURPHY Come on, you lovers, it's gettin' late... 
They move toward the hallway. 
Bromden and Harding are the only two who watch them go. 
INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT 
as McMurphy passes several doors, reaches the door of his choice, fumbles with the keys, finds the right one, and opens the door to the seclusion room. 
MCMURPHY (standing aside) In ya go... 
BILLY (holding back) M-M-M-Mack? 
MCMURPHY It's okay, kid. Everything it going to be okay... I'll come back an' getcha in a while... 'Kay... 
Candy and Billy, hand in hand, enter the small room, which has a bed in it. 
McMurphy closes the door, looks at the keys, and pockets them. CAMERA TRACKS with McMurphy, who is a very weary man, back into the day room. 
INT. DAY ROOM - NIGHT 
MUSIC OVER LOUDSPEAKER as McMurphy crashes heavily into his chair. He can hardly keep his eyes open as he looks around. 
Harding sits nearby. 
Taber is lying on a couch, his head in Rose's lap. 
Cheswick is asleep on the table. 
Ellis stands nailed to the wall. 
Bromden sits by the window -- waiting. CAMERA HOLDS on Bromden. 
MCMURPHY (V.O.) Hey, Harding, wake me in an hour. 
HARDING (V.O.) Sure, Mack... 
CAMERA PUSHES INTO WINDOW. TIME LAPSE SHOT of the DAWN and SUN RISING. 
WASHINGTON (V.O.) (very far away; getting closer) Bibbit? Where's Bill Bibbit, ya damn goons? 
INT. DAY ROOM - EARLY MORNING 
as Washington jostles McMurphy awake. 
WASHINGTON Come on, get over there! 
McMurphy allows himself to be led to the heavy security partition, by the men's dorm, where all the patients are lined up. 
It is morning and the day room is a mess: 
A few chairs turned over. Paper cups and empty bottles. Puddles of cough syrup, orange juice and apple juice worked into sticky masses. 
Rose sits by herself on the couch. 
Bromden is the last one led to the lineup, where Big Nurse waits. 
INT. NURSES' STATION - MORNING 
as Big Nurse, still on the phone, sees Miller go sprawling across the floor. She grabs the intercom. 
BIG NURSE (V.O.) (through loudspeaker) Washington! Warren! To the day room, immediately! 
INT. DAY ROOM - MORNING 
McMurphy opens the screen, raises the window, and helps Candy and Rose out as Washington and Warren converge on them. McMurphy and Bromden wheel around. 
Washington, Warren and Miller appear around the corner, take one look, and head straight for McMurphy. 
WASHINGTON (stopping just short) 'Kay, let's have the keys an' nobody get hurt! 
Washington's words are cut off as, O.S., Nurse Pilbow SCREAMS... a bloodcurdling scream. They turn to see Nurse Pilbow enter the nurses' station, her uniform splattered with blood, hysterically talking to Big Nurse (we can't hear her). 
Big Nurse and Nurse Pilbow rush out of the nurses' station and head down the hallway. 
McMurphy is glued to the spot. 
CANDY (calling from outside) Come on, come on, let's go! 
McMurphy hesitates, then moves across the day room toward the hallway. 
INT. DOCTOR SPIVEY'S OFFICE - MORNING 
CAMERA SHOOTING TOWARD the door, crammed full of patients, who stare at the scene with curious detached looks, as Big Nurse and Nurse Pilbow force their way through the patients. The crowd parts and Big Nurse stops in the doorway, horrified at what she sees. CAMERA HOLDS on Big Nurse's reaction. A beat, then McMurphy appears alongside Big Nurse and is stricken by what he sees. 
McMURPHY AND BIG NURSE'S POV - REVERSE SHOT - DOCTOR SPIVEY'S OFFICE 
The office is splattered with blood. Billy is lying face up, hanging over Spivey's desk, dead. His throat and both wrists are cut. A broken picture frame, containing a photograph of Spivey's family, lies nearby. 
MCMURPHY Billy, oh, Billy boy... 
McMurphy crosses into the room and kneels alongside Billy's body. He gently lays his hand on Billy's face. 
BIG NURSE Get away from him! Don't you dare touch him! 
McMurphy turns and leaps at Big Nurse, grabbing her throat; he drives her into the Acutes and Nurse Pilbow. 
INT. HALLWAY - MORNING 
as McMurphy, Big Nurse, Nurse Pilbow and several Acutes go down, arms and legs intertwined, kicking, trying to get away as McMurphy strangles Big Nurse. 
Nurse Pilbow screaming, as Washington, Warren, Miller rush in, trying to break his hold on Big Nurse's throat, her face turning blue. McMurphy's face, twisted by his passion, when Washington lands a rabbit punch and MeMurphy's face relaxes as he passes out. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. DAY ROOM - DAY 
MUSIC OVER LOUDSPEAKER. The day room is as it was in the beginning. Harding is dealing out a game of blackjack to Martini, 
Scanlon, Cheswick and Fredrickson. 
Taber, pencil in band, sits pondering over a blank sheet of paper. 
Ruckly is turning a grimy photograph over in his hands. 
Bancini sits wagging his head, mumbling over and over, "Tired... awful tired..." Ellis stands against the wall, arms outstretched. 
HARDING (V.O.) (over last scene, in McMurphy's style) Okay, suckers, place your bets... 
INT. HALLWAY - DAY 
Bromden is mopping the floor near the security gate to the visitors' room, when a key hits the lock. Bromden looks up expectantly. 
BROMDEN'S POV 
as Sefelt and Miller enter the visitors' room, cross to the security gate and pass into the hallway. Bromden goes back to his mopping. 
INT. DAY ROOM - DAY 
as Sefelt jauntily enters the day room. 
BIG NURSE (V.O.) (through loudspeaker) Did everything go well, Mister Sefelt? 
Sefelt turns to the nurses' station where, inside, Big Nurse sits very erect, wearing a back brace that reaches up around her neck. Sefelt shows his teeth and gums to Big Nurse. 
BIG NURSE (V.O.) (CONT'D) (through loudspeaker) That's very nice. Now, doesn't that make you feel better, Mister Sefelt? 
SEFELT Yes, ma'am... 
BIG NURSE Good... 
She turns back to her work. 
Sefelt crosses to the card game, where he sits and catches Fredrickson's attention; showing him his teeth. Fredrickson smiles at Sefelt and blows him a kiss. 
HARDING (who has been dealing) Big Ace... a lovely lady... another ace... an' a little trey, hey, hey, whadaya say... hit or sit? 
SCANLON Hit! 
SEFELT (to Fredrickson) Ya know what, Fred? 
FREDRICKSON What? 
HARDING (dealing a card to Scanlon) Big king, too bad... 
SEFELT Just wait till you hear...

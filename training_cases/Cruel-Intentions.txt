1    EXT. MANHATTAN SKYLINE - DAY                               1 
We circle around the island of Manhattan moving closer and closer till we're looking down on Fifth Avenue. As the melody continues to play we MOVE towards a building and ZOOM into a window. 
2    INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - DAY                              2 
A fifty-year old female therapist (DR. GREENBAUM) sits at her desk, frowning as she takes notes. Books of Jung and Freud line the shelves. 
A young man (SEBASTIAN VALMONT) sits in a chair in front of her looking impatient. 
The therapist continues to write notes. 
DR. GREENBAUM Jesus. We've been at this for six months. 
SEBASTIAN I know. 
DR. GREENBAUM And you haven't made an ounce of progress. 
SEBASTIAN I know. 
Sebastian takes out a cigarette. 
DR. GREENBAUM (not looking up) There's no smoking in my office. 
Sebastian sneers at her then puts the cigarette away. Dr. Greenbaum finishes her notes and looks up at him, shaking her head. 
SEBASTIAN What do you want me to say? That I'm supposed to feel remorse because I act the way I do? The truth is I don't. 
Dr. Greenbaum shakes her head and takes notes. 
SEBASTIAN (cont'd) Look, I'm not like all the other kids in high school. I don't care about book reports and extra-credit. Teachers are idiots anyway. The only challenge out there for me is women. You see a girl you like. You pursue them. You conquer. You move on. It's exciting. 
DR. GREENBAUM But you said you have the worst reputation. 
SEBASTIAN I do. 
DR. GREENBAUM Don't you want to change that? 
SEBASTIAN Let me tell you something, doctor. Chicks love a guy with a bad rap. They say they don't, but they don't mean it. They all think that they're the ones that are going to "save me." The trick is to let them think it's true. 
DR. GREENBAUM I think that's all the time we have for today. 
SEBASTIAN Same time next week? 
DR. GREENBAUM No. This is going to be our last session. 
SEBASTIAN Why? I like spending time with you. You know, you're quite attractive for a woman your age. You have killer legs. Killer. 
DR. GREENBAUM This isn't a joke. Your parents spend a lot of money to send you here. I'm trying to help you. 
SEBASTIAN Don't be insecure, Doc. You're a big help. 
Sebastian picks up a book of Freud. 
SEBASTIAN (cont'd) He was a coke addict, you know. 
DR. GREENBAUM You think you can come in here with that cute little smirk on your face and try and flirt with me. It doesn't work, Sebastian. 
SEBASTIAN It works a little. 
DR. GREENBAUM No it doesn't. I see right through you. 
SEBASTIAN You do? 
DR. GREENBAUM I hope for your sake you grow out of this immature phase. It's going to get you into trouble. 
SEBASTIAN Well, you don't have to get nasty about it. 
Sebastian approaches a photo on her desk and picks it up. 
DR. GREENBAUM My daughter, Rachel. 
CLOSE ON: Two hands ripping open the fish. 
CLOSE ON: Two hands rolling a chunk of tuna into a rice roll. 
7    INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY                     7 
CLOSE ON: Two hands which carry a lavish tray of sushi through several doors until we enter the final door leading into - 
8    INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                 8 
A enormous living room by Manhattan standards, with a view that overlooks the park. Eclectic art from around the world emphasize the Valmont's passion for travel. 
SOOK-HEE, the Valmont's housekeeper sets a tray of sushi in front of - 
KATHRYN MERTEUIL, a seventeen year old porcelain skinned WASP with all the grooming you could want in an East Coast child. She sits with a forced smile on her face and listens attentively as - 
BUNNY CALDWELL, a forty year old nouveau-riche socialite talks incessantly. CECILE CALDWELL, her beautiful teenage daughter, sits by her side. She wears a T-shirt with a Koala Bear on it. 
MRS. CALDWELL I can't tell you how happy we are that Cecile is going to be attending Oakwood with you this fall. You've always been an inspiration to Beau and I on raising her. We just hope she can rise to the high standards which you've set for her. 
KATHRYN I'll do my best. 
Sook-Hee pours a dish of soy sauce in front of Kathryn. 
KATHRYN (cont'd) (to Sook-Hee, in Vietnamese) Thank you, Sook-Hee. That will be all. 
Sook-Hee leaves. 
CECILE What was that? 
KATHRYN I was thanking her. Vietnamese is such a beautiful language. 
MRS. CALDWELL (cont'd) Kathryn is a straight A student at Oakwood as well as being President of the French Club. Listen to whatever she has to say and you'll go far. 
KATHRYN (in French) You're too kind. 
MRS. CALDWELL How do you do it? I mean with all peer pressuring that goes on in high school. Where do you get your strength? 
KATHRYN I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel temptations of peer pressure, I... (takes out her crucifix) turn to God and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but it works. 
MRS. CALDWELL That's beautiful. 
CECILE What are the boys like? 
MRS. CALDWELL Cecile, is that the best you can do? (to Kathryn) You must forgive her, Kathryn. She's never been in a co-educational atmosphere before. 
KATHRYN Don't worry, it's totally understandable. Most of the boys that matriculate at Oakwood are very upstanding gentleman, however there are the occasional bad apples. 
MRS. CALDWELL Like your step-brother Sebastian. I can't believe they didn't expel him after what he did to the school nurse. 
SEBASTIAN (O.S.) I hear she's recovering quite well. 
Mrs. Caldwell turns to see Sebastian standing in the doorway. He walks over and takes a seat. 
SEBASTIAN (cont'd) Nice to see you again, Mrs. Caldwell. 
MRS. CALDWELL You remember my daughter, Cecile. 
SEBASTIAN My, what an adorable shirt you're wearing. 
CECILE My father just took me on a trip to Australia. 
SEBASTIAN How are things down under? Blossoming I hope. 
KATHRYN Cecile's attending Oakwood in the fall. 
SEBASTIAN Outstanding. 
CECILE What year are you in? 
SEBASTIAN I'm what you would call a fifth year senior. 
CECILE But I thought high school is only four years. 
SEBASTIAN It is, unless you're a fuck up, like myself. 
He winks at Cecile. 
MRS. CALDWELL I think we'll be going now. (to Kathryn) Thanks for all your help. 
Kathryn stands and approaches Cecile. 
KATHRYN I'll call you later and we'll get together and plan your curriculum. 
12   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                 12 
KATHRYN In any event, my feelings were hurt when I learned that he had fallen for someone else. Someone chaste... pure... innocent. 
SEBASTIAN You don't mean? 
13   EXT. PARK - DAY                                            13 
Cecile turns toward the camera, while eating a double scoop ice cream cone and wearing a Mickey Mouse Club hat. 
KATHRYN (V.O.) None other than Cecile Caldwell. 
She takes a lick of the ice cream, which falls off the cone. She mouths the word "shoot" and stomps her feet 
14   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                 14 
Sebastian snickers. 
KATHRYN I don't find this very funny, 
SEBASTIAN So that's what this is all about. (imitating Kathryn) We'll get together and plan your curriculum. 
KATHRYN Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. When I get through with her, she'll be the premier Blow Job Queen of the Tri-State area and poor little Court's heart will be shattered. 
SEBASTIAN Why go through Cecile? Why not just attack Court? 
KATHRYN Because if there's an attack made on Court it could be traced back to me. I can't allow that to happen. Everybody loves me and I intend to keep it that way. 
SEBASTIAN I see your point... though why should I care? 
KATHRYN I need you to seduce our young Cecile. Introduce her to your world of decadence and debauchery. 
SEBASTIAN Sounds intriguing. 
KATHRYN She's quite cute you know. Young supple breasts, a tight firm ass and an uncharted pootie. 
Sebastian watches Kathryn rub herself. He licks his lips. 
KATHRYN (cont'd) Be her Captain Picard, Valmont. Boldly go where no man has gone before. 
Sebastian places his hand over Kathryn's as she continues to rub herself. He thinks for a moment, then: 
SEBASTIAN I can't. 
Kathryn throws his hand off of hers. 
KATHRYN Why not? 
SEBASTIAN Oh come on, Kathryn. It's too easy. "But I thought high school was only four years." I mean, please. She knows nothing. She's seen nothing. I could have her under the table at Au Bar sucking me off before the appetizer arrived. Go get one of those moron friends of yours to do it. I have a reputation to uphold. 
KATHRYN Oh but diddling the therapist's daughter is a challenge? 
SEBASTIAN That was just simple revenge. What I have planned requires sheer genius. 
He takes a magazine and throws it on the table. Kathryn picks it up. It's the latest issue of "Seventeen." 
KATHRYN I'm not interested in the latest dating tips from Jonathan Taylor Thomas. 
SEBASTIAN Shut up and turn to page 64. 
She turns to the page. INSERT MAGAZINE ARTICLE: The title reads: A VIRGIN'S MANIFESTO. "Why I Plan To Wait Until Marriage," by Annette Harrison. Age 17. Kansas City, Missouri. 
KATHRYN Jesus Christ, is she for real? 
SEBASTIAN Oh yes. I've read it over and over again. This baby's the real deal. Daddy's little angel. A paradigm of chastity and virtue. 
KATHRYN B.F.D. What do you plan to do? Fly to Kansas and woo little Dorothy. 
SEBASTIAN It just so happens we're not in Kansas anymore. Our little angel's father has accepted the new headmaster position at Oakwood. She's staying with my aunt up in Connecticut while Daddy sells his house. Can you imagine what this would do for my reputation? Screwing the new headmaster's virginal daughter before school starts? It will be my greatest victory. 
KATHRYN You don't stand a chance. Even this is out of your league. 
SEBASTIAN Care to make a wager on that? 
KATHRYN I'll think about it... 
SEBASTIAN Oh well, duty calls. Time to add another chapter to my work of art. 
He holds up a leather bound JOURNAL. 
KATHRYN Oh gee, your journal. Could you be more queer? 
SEBASTIAN Could you be more desperate to read it? 
Aunt Helen gallops down the ridge followed by Annette. 
17   EXT. ESTATE - GARDEN - DAY                                 17 
Sebastian stands holding a shotgun. A groundskeeper, FRANKLIN stands by the trap. 
SEBASTIAN Pull! 
The TARGET soars into the air, 
SEBASTIAN (cont'd) Die motherfucker! 
He fires the gun, missing the target. 
SEBASTIAN (cont'd) Shit, shit, shit. 
Franklin shakes his head. WE HEAR a cat MEOW. Sebastian perks up. 
SEBASTIAN (cont'd) Kitty. Kitty. 
He quietly reloads his rifle. WE HEAR the cat MEOW again. Sebastian searches for the cat. 
SEBASTIAN (cont'd) Puss Puss Puss Puss Puss. 
He raises his rifle and takes aim. 
AUNT HELEN (O.S.) Sebastian! 
He lowers his rifle and turns to SEE Aunt Helen and Annette riding over to him. He waves. 
Aunt Helen dismounts from her horse and they hug. 
SEBASTIAN (cont'd) I've been looking all over for you. God, I've missed you. 
AUNT HELEN I've missed you too. How are your parents? 
SEBASTIAN They're coming back next week. I write them everyday. 
She strokes his cheek, lovingly. 
AUNT HELEN Sebastian, this is Annette Harrison. She's going to be staying with me for a few weeks. 
SEBASTIAN I guess that makes two of us. Welcome. 
He extends his hand and they shake. 
SEBASTIAN (cont'd) (to Aunt Helen) Why don't you head in and whip us up some of that ice tea of yours? We'll take care of the horses. 
AUNT HELEN Anything for you, my dear. 
Sebastian climbs on Aunt Helen's horse. 
AUNT HELEN (cont'd) Stay out of trouble you two. 
SEBASTIAN & ANNETTE We will. 
He smiles at Annette and beckons her to follow. 
18   INT. ESTATE - STABLE - DAY                                 18 
Sebastian and Annette put the riding gear away. 
SEBASTIAN So what year are you going into? 
ANNETTE Junior. 
SEBASTIAN Got a boyfriend back home? 
ANNETTE No. 
SEBASTIAN Why not? 
ANNETTE I don't know. Relationships seem too distracting. I'd rather concentrate on my studies. 
SEBASTIAN You a lesbo? 
ANNETTE (annoyed) No. 
She bends over to pick up the saddle. 
SEBASTIAN Nice. 
She sighs, disgusted, then turns toward him. 
RONALD (cont'd) You're concentrating too much on your bowing. Let it flow. 
He stands and sits behind her. 
RONALD (cont'd) Here, let me help you. 
He places his hand over hers. 
RONALD (cont'd) Now close your eyes and let's try again. 
She closes her eyes and they repeat the scale. It sounds much better. Ronald takes the moment to study Cecile's face. It's obvious he's smitten with her. 
ON KATHRYN: who watches from the door. A grin crosses her face. 
Ronald replaces her other hand and plays a beautiful Bach Sonata, with he and Cecile sharing the bowing. He closes his eyes as the music takes over him. Now Cecile opens her eyes and gazes into his. The feeling is mutual. 
ON KATHRYN: She accidentally bangs her hand onto a table which causes a metal tray to fall to the ground. 
Ronald and Cecile look up as Kathryn replaces the tray 
KATHRYN I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt. Your playing was beautiful. 
Ronald quickly stands and moves away from Cecile 
CECILE Kathryn, this is Ronald Clifford. He's giving me music lessons over the summer. 
Ronald approaches and shakes Kathryn's hand. 
RONALD Pleased to meet you. 
KATHRYN Likewise I'm sure. 
CECILE Ronald is one of the few high school students attending Juliard. He's composing his first opera. 
RONALD It's based on the life of Doctor Martin Luther King. 
CECILE Doctor King is my favorite. 
Ronald shakes his head, but laughs. Cecile looks at him and smiles. Kathryn rolls her eyes. 
RONALD I guess our hour's up. Same time tomorrow? 
Cecile nods. 
20   EXT. BLAINE'S HOUSE - DAY                                  20 
Another nice home in Connecticut. Sebastian's Porsche is parked outside. 
21   INT. BLAINE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY                        21 
A typical teenagers bedroom, expect this one is a shrine to Herb Ritts homo-erotic art. 
BLAINE TUTTLE, Oakwood Prep's resident drug-dealer and open homosexual, sits at his desk separating pot seeds from his stash. 
Sebastian paces behind him. 
SEBASTIAN Unbelievable. Some fag, no offense - 
BLAINE - none taken - 
SEBASTIAN - wrote a letter to this chick and saying shit about me. 
BLAINE Any ideas who it could be? 
SEBASTIAN Blaine, if I knew who it was that person wouldn't be alive right now. 
BLAINE Where did you say she's from? 
SEBASTIAN Kansas. Who the hell do I know in Kansas? 
BLAINE Greg McConnell. 
SEBASTIAN The football stud? 
BLAINE He's from Kansas City. I wouldn't be surprised if he was your rat. 
SEBASTIAN It would make sense. McConnell hates me. I fingered his girlfriend at the game last year. 
BLAINE I don't think that bothered him. 
SEBASTIAN What do you mean? 
BLAINE Let's just say Greg likes tackling tight ends on and off the field. 
SEBASTIAN No, it's okay. I mean I look at you with all your morals and values and well, YOU seem to be happy in your choices. I envy you. No bullshit. 
ANNETTE (caught off guard) Thank you. 
SEBASTIAN Seriously, you're amazing. You have everything going for you. (counts with his fingers) You're smart, you're beautiful, you're determined. You're everything I want in a girlfriend. 
ANNETTE (jokingly) Shut up. 
SEBASTIAN I wasn't kidding. I'd like to take you out. 
ANNETTE Look, I'm flattered but, seriously it could never work. 
SEBASTIAN Why not? 
ANNETTE Because you act like a pig. 
He swims towards her. 
SEBASTIAN Do you deny that there's an attraction between us? 
ANNETTE I don't... I don't want to answer that... look we're friends. 
SEBASTIAN You don't find me cute? Come on, look at these muscles. 
He flexes for her. She laughs. 
ANNETTE I'm sorry, but you're not my type. 
SEBASTIAN Fine. Friends it is. I can live with that. 
He extends his arms out for a hug. She moves in and hugs him. Her smile turns to a look of horror. 
ANNETTE You're naked. 
SEBASTIAN It's my house. 
She pushes him off her. 
ANNETTE That's repulsive. 
SEBASTIAN What's the big deal? We're friends. Haven't you ever seen your friends naked before? 
Annette climbs out of the pool. 
ANNETTE Get some manners. 
She walks into the house. 
SEBASTIAN Sorry, I didn't know you were peenaphobic. 
She flips him the bird as she heads into the house. 
SEBASTIAN (cont'd) Oooooo, naughty naughty. Ten Hail Mary's for you. (beat) Good night. 
27   EXT. BLAINE'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                27 
Sebastian's Porsche is parked outside. 
28   INT. BLAINE'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT                      28 
Sebastian presses his ear to the door. 
GREG (O.S.) (moaning) Oh baby... oh baby... 
SEBASTIAN Baby? (checks his watch) Right on time. 
29   INT. BLAINE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT                      29 
GREG McCONNELL, All-American star football player for Oakwood prep is busy getting his cock sucked by Blaine, who lies under the covers. 
GREG (near orgasm) Oh God... Oh God, I'm gonna cum. I'm gonna cum... I'm gonna... 
The door swings open and Sebastian enters. 
SEBASTIAN Hey Blaine, did I leave my... holy shit. 
GREG Jesus! 
Greg throws the covers over his face. Sebastian smiles and sits. He lights a cigarette. No movement from under the covers. 
SEBASTIAN Greg, is that you under the covers? 
GREG (from under the covers) Get out of here. 
SEBASTIAN (cont'd) Have a nice sleep last night? 
ANNETTE It was fine. 
SEBASTIAN I wish I could say the same for myself. I was up thinking about you all night. 
ANNETTE I thought we agreed that we were going to be friends. 
SEBASTIAN Yes, well unfortunately I can't just switch the "on" button to "off." The sad fact of the matter is that you've unintentionally rubbed off on me. 
Annette stops running and turns to him. 
ANNETTE And that's a bad thing? 
SEBASTIAN I'm trying to better myself, but the one person who can help me is the same one pushing me away. 
ANNETTE I'm sorry, but I'm not here to be your savior. 
SEBASTIAN Well try this one on for size. I think I'm falling in love with you. 
ANNETTE You don't even know me. 
SEBASTIAN Don't you believe in love at first sight? 
ANNETTE Yes, but only when it's mutual. And this is far from mutual. 
SEBASTIAN Ouch. Do you think we could spend some time together this morning? 
ANNETTE I can't. I'm seeing a friend. 
SEBASTIAN Who? 
ANNETTE That's none of your business. 
SEBASTIAN How about tonight? 
ANNETTE I'm busy. 
SEBASTIAN Doing what? 
ANNETTE That's also none of your business. 
SEBASTIAN Tell me what to do, Annette. How can I win your heart. I'll do anything. I can't get you out of my mind. 
ANNETTE You truly want to do something to make me happy? 
SEBASTIAN Yes. 
ANNETTE And you promise to abide by it? 
SEBASTIAN Without question. 
ANNETTE Alright. (beat) I want you to leave and go back to New York. 
SEBASTIAN What? 
ANNETTE If that's a problem, then I'll make arrangements to stay with some friends. 
Sebastian thinks for a moment. He's pissed. 
SEBASTIAN I'll leave this afternoon. Happy? 
ANNETTE It's not about being happy. You and I can't - 
He shifts the cart into reverse and backs away. 
31   EXT. BEACH - DAY                                           31 
Annette and Greg walk along the beach and gaze out at the ocean. 
GREG He told you he's failing in love with you? I've never known him to say those words before. 
ANNETTE Really? I thought he said it all the time. 
GREG That's not his style. one thing I can say about Valmont. He always speaks the truth. 
Annette looks lost. 
GREG (cont'd) What's wrong? 
ANNETTE Nothing. 
GREG Is there a mutual feeling between you two? 
KATHRYN Shhh. 
ON TELEVISION - RONALD FINISHES THE SONG. CECILE STANDS AND APPLAUDS. RONALD TAKES A BOW. 
CECILE (ON VIDEO) That was beautiful. 
RONALD (ON VIDEO) Almost as beautiful as you. 
Cecile blushes. Ronald checks his watch. 
RONALD (ON VIDEO) Well, I guess it's getting late. Please thank Kathryn for the use of her Steinway. 
CECILE (ON VIDEO) I'll see you tomorrow. 
RONALD (ON VIDEO) Absolutely. 
He approaches her, awkwardly then shakes her hand. 
KATHRYN (O.S.) Idiot! 
ANGLE ON: LIVING ROOM - Kathryn FREEZE FRAMES the image. 
KATHRYN What's wrong with you? 
SEBASTIAN You ready for this? I've recently discovered that our good friend Mrs. Caldwell is the one who sent the letter to Annette urging her to stay away from me. 
KATHRYN Interesting. 
SEBASTIAN I now plan to devote all my energies to destroying the douche bag. Any luck corrupting her daughter? 
KATHRYN No. 
SEBASTIAN Call Cecile up and get her to come over. I'll bust that cherry in a heartbeat. 
She walks over to the "freeze frame" image of Ronald and Cecile on the television. 
KATHRYN The plot thickens. It appears that Cecile has fallen for her music teacher. 
SEBASTIAN Ooo, I'm sure Mrs. Caldwell will love that. 
KATHRYN Not to mention Court Reynolds. Unfortunately, Ronald's moving with the speed of a Special Olympic Bobsledder. 
SEBASTIAN What's your plan of attack? 
KATHRYN I rat Cecile out to mommy. Mommy goes ballistic and ends their relationship. Boo hoo. 
SEBASTIAN But who will they turn to for help? 
Kathryn smiles and sits on Sebastian's lap. 
KATHRYN Cecile is planning to go away with Court next week. I'll need you to speed up her sexual awakenings. 
Sebastian rubs her shoulders. 
SEBASTIAN I'm at your service. 
KATHRYN Thank you. Mmmm, that feels good. 
SEBASTIAN Oh sis. You're so tense. 
Sebastian moves his hand down her shirt and under her bra. He's met with no resistance. 
KATHRYN I hate when things don't go my way. It makes me so horny. 
SEBASTIAN I hate it too. 
He takes his hand out from her shirt and slides it under her skirt. 
SEBASTIAN (cont'd) (baby talk) Oh baby, your soaking. 
KATHRYN I know. 
She closes her eyes and rubs his crotch. She unzips his fly. 
KATHRYN (cont'd) (seductively) Any luck with your girl? 
SEBASTIAN Moving along quite well. 
KATHRYN Have you succeeded in your task? 
SEBASTIAN Any day now. 
KATHRYN Well, let me know when you do. Until then. 
KATHRYN Because we want to see Cecile happy and we know you make her happy. 
She hands Ronald a pen and paper. 
KATHRYN (cont'd) Now you just march yourself into the study and start writing. We'll be there to check on you in a minute. 
Ronald leaves the room. Sebastian closes the door while Kathryn picks up the phone and dials. 
SEBASTIAN Who are you calling? 
KATHRYN Cecile. 
Sebastian hangs up the phone. 
KATHRYN (cont'd) What are you doing? 
SEBASTIAN Before we go through with this, I just want you to be aware of the damage we're going to cause. 
KATHRYN I'm aware. 
She picks up the phone and he hangs it up again. 
SEBASTIAN Are you really? I mean, we've done some pretty fucked up shit in our time but this... I mean, we're destroying an innocent girl. You do realize that. 
KATHRYN What is that? Oh my God, it's your conscience. 
She reaches out toward his temple, plucks a handful of something, throws it to the ground and STOMPS on it. 
KATHRYN (cont'd) Court Renolds is going down and if you're not going to help me, someone else will. 
SEBASTIAN You amaze me. 
KATHRYN Eat me, Sebastian. It's alright for you to fuck everyone, but because I'm a girl it's wrong. Well let me tell you something, I didn't ask to be a girl. Do you think I relish the fact that I have to act like Mary Sunshine twenty four seven, so I can be considered a "laaaady." Do you think I take great delight when I hear - "Kathryn is so wonderful." "Kathryn is a model child." "Kathryn is going to make an excellent wife one day." (beat) I'm the Marsha fucking Brady of the upper East Side and sometimes I want to kill myself for it. No, I don't enjoy being a part of the weaker sex and for that reason everyone around me is going to suffer. So there's your psychoanalysis Doctor Freud. Now are you in or are you out? 
Sebastian says nothing. Kathryn picks up the phone and dials. 
KATHRYN (cont'd) Hello, Cecile. It's Kathryn. Alright, stop crying. I understand. Hold on for Sebastian. 
She hands the phone to Sebastian. 
SEBASTIAN Cecile. Now I need you to listen to me very carefully. I have a letter from Ronald that he asked me to give to you. Now I can't exactly bring it to your house, since your mother despises me so here's what we're going to do. 
44   CALDWELL APARTMENT - CECILE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT              44 
The clock reads 1:30. A large collection of antiques and stuffed animals line the room and walls. Cecile lies in bed, eyes wide open. She crawls out of it, dressed in sweats. 
45   MANHATTAN STREET - NIGHT                                   45 
Cecile exits a building and steps into a waiting taxi. 
46   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - SEBASTIAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT       46 
Cecile lies on Sebastian's bed. She finishes the letter while Sebastian fiddles with a camera. 
CECILE Finished. 
She hands the letter to Sebastian, who looks it over. 
SEBASTIAN Excellent. 
CECILE You think he'll like it? 
SEBASTIAN He'll love it. 
He points the camera at Cecile and snaps a photo. 
CECILE What are you doing? 
SEBASTIAN Just taking your photo. 
CECILE I look terrible. 
SEBASTIAN Mmmm, you're right. Those clothes don't do you justice. Why don't you take them off. 
Cecile gasps. 
CECILE I'm getting out of here. 
She stands to leave. Sebastian blocks her path. 
SEBASTIAN I'm sorry that was out of line. 
CECILE (scared) I want to go home. 
MRS. CALDWELL I didn't know you'd be here, Sebastian. 
SEBASTIAN I wasn't planning on it, but being such a lovely day, why waste it in the city. Anyone for tennis? 
He looks at Cecile and strokes the shaft of his racket. 
Cecile stands and rushes into the house. 
SEBASTIAN (cont'd) What's wrong with her? 
No one knows. 
MRS. CALDWELL (cont'd) Would you excuse me for a minute? 
Mrs. Caldwell follows her into the house. 
SEBASTIAN (concerned) I hope she's alright. 
AUNT HELEN I better go check on them. 
Aunt Helen stands and enters the house. 
SEBASTIAN Alone again. (beat) What are you up to today? 
ANNETTE I'm doing some volunteer work. 
SEBASTIAN Need any company? 
ANNETTE You? Volunteer? I don't think so. 
SEBASTIAN I don't know? Maybe I'd like it. I'm trying to change here. You could be supportive. 
ANNETTE (smiling) Okay. 
SEBASTIAN Babe, you're looking at the next Mother Teresa. 
Annette shakes her head and laughs. 
50   INT. ESTATE - CECILE'S GUEST ROOM - DAY                    50 
Cecile talks on the phone. 
CECILE Please. I need you. I don't know what to do. You're the only one I can talk to. 
51   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                 51 
Kathryn listens on the other end of the conversation.

She hangs up the phone and smiles.

A NURSE escorts Sebastian and Annette down the hall. 
NURSE It's really nice when the young people help out. Most of our patients don't have any family nearby. 
They stop at a door and open it. An OLD MAN sits in his hospital bed. 
NURSE (cont'd) Mister Gottlieb, we have a visitor for you. 
Sebastian starts to enter the room, when the nurse stops him. 
NURSE (cont'd) Actually Sebastian, you're going to be spending the hour with Mrs. Sugarman. 
The Nurse escorts an unhappy Sebastian down the hall. Annette waves "bye bye" to him.

Annette sits by Mister Gottlieb's bed and reads from a book of poetry. 
55   INT. RETIREMENT HOME - MRS. SUGARMAN'S ROOM - DAY          55 
A senile MRS. SUGARMAN sits in bed, while Sebastian does a newspaper crossword puzzle and ignores her. He smokes a cigarette and flicks the ash into her bedpan which lies next to her on the bed. 
MRS. SUGERMAN Did I ever tell you the time when my late husband sent me - 
SEBASTIAN Yes, you already did. 
SEBASTIAN (cont'd) Cut it out. 
He continues to laugh. She stops making the face. 
ANNETTE Oh dear, are you actually laughing? 
SEBASTIAN No. 
ANNETTE No? 
She makes the face again. He laughs. 
SEBASTIAN Stop that. 
She laughs with him. 
ANNETTE There's hope for you, yet. 
She reaches out and holds his hand. He squeezes it. 
57   INT. ESTATE - CECILE'S GUEST ROOM - DAY                    57 
Cecile lies in the bed. There's a knock on the door. 
CECILE Who is it? 
KATHRYN (O.S.) It's Kathryn. 
Cecile bolts up and unlocks the door. Kathryn stands there with a worried look on her face. 
KATHRYN (cont'd) Are you okay? 
CECILE No. 
Kathryn enters and locks the door behind her. Cecile is crying. 
KATHRYN Calm down. Tell me what's wrong. 
CECILE Something awful happened last night. 
KATHRYN What do you mean?! 
CECILE I... I don't think you want to know. 
KATHRYN Cecile, you have to tell me. 
CECILE It involves your brother. He... took advantage of me. 
KATHRYN Does your mother know? 
CECILE If she knew, she'd kill me. It happened at your house last night. 
KATHRYN Why didn't you do something? 
CECILE I don't know. 
KATHRYN So, let me get this straight. You came over to our house late last night and he forced intercourse on you. 
CECILE Well... not exactly. 
KATHRYN He made you give him a blow job. 
CECILE No. 
KATHRYN Well what then? 
Cecile waits a moment, then whispers in her ear. 
KATHRYN (cont'd) He ate you out? 
CECILE If that's what you call it. 
KATHRYN Cecile, I think you're going to have a hard time crying rape if that's all he did. 
CECILE What do I do then? 
KATHRYN Well did you like it? 
CECILE Well... I don't know - it was weird. At first it felt icky, then it felt kind of okay. Then, I started getting really hot and then I started shaking and then like, I don't t know... it felt like an explosion, but a good one. 
Kathryn laughs. 
KATHRYN Cecile, you had an orgasm. 
She nods. He points to her book. 
SEBASTIAN (cont'd) Great book. What's the guy's name, Florentino... 
ANNETTE Florentino Ariza. 
Sebastian sticks his hand in his pocket and fiddles around. 
SEBASTIAN My friend Monsieur Philipe is a friend of Florentino. 
ANNETTE Who's Monsieur Philipe? 
SEBASTIAN You don't know Monsieur Philipe? 
Sebastian takes out a SOCK PUPPET. 
SEBASTIAN (cont'd) (low voice) Bonjour mademoiselle. 
ANNETTE (laughs) Bonjour Monsieur Philipe. 
SEBASTIAN (Monsieur Philipe voice) You are very pretty. I would like to kiss you. 
The puppet kisses her on the cheek. 
SEBASTIAN (cont'd) (Monsieur Philipe voice) Oooo, that felt good. 
ANNETTE Thank you. 
He kisses her on the cheek. 
SEBASTIAN (Monsieur Philipe voice) That felt good too. I will kiss you all over. 
The puppet attacks a laughing Annette. She playfully grabs Sebastian and starts to tickle him. Sebastian tickles her back. 
They roll around on the ground until Sebastian lands on top of her. A moment of tense silence passes and Sebastian kisses her. The kissing intensifies until she pushes him off her. 
Sebastian stands. 
SEBASTIAN (cont'd) I'm sorry about that. 
ANNETTE I am too. 
He paces for a moment and his mood turns to anger. 
SEBASTIAN You know what? I don't take it back. 
ANNETTE Why are you doing this? 
SEBASTIAN Because I'm in love with you. 
ANNETTE I thought you said we were going to be friends. 
SEBASTIAN I can't handle it. I can't keep my feelings bottled up like you. Can you honestly tell me that you feel nothing for me? ... Tell me! 
ANNETTE I have feelings for you. 
SEBASTIAN Then what's wrong? I love you Annette. It's not like you have a husband, unless your married to Jesus. 
ANNETTE That's not fair. 
SEBASTIAN Why can't we be together? 
Annette's eyes well up with tears. 
ANNETTE You really want to know? 
SEBASTIAN Yes. 
ANNETTE It's because I don't trust myself with you. (beat) I took a vow and because of you I'm tempted to break it. Don't destroy that for me. Please. 
She hurries off. 
61   INT. ESTATE - SEBASTIAN'S ROOM - DAY                       61 
Sebastian enters the room and slams the door behind him. 
SEBASTIAN (frustrated) Shit. 
He hears the shower running from the bathroom. 
62   INT. ESTATE - SEBASTIAN'S BATHROOM - DAY                   62 
Sebastian enters the room. Cecile sticks her head out from the shower curtain. 
Annette sits on the windowsill watching Sebastian as he sleeps. He slowly starts to wake and looks at her. 
ANNETTE Hi. 
SEBASTIAN Hi. 
She walks over to him and kisses him. 
SEBASTIAN (cont'd) You alright? 
ANNETTE I'm fine. I have to get going to my friends' house. (beat) Was it -- 
SEBASTIAN It was perfect. 
She smiles and holds her hand out. He takes her hand in his. 
75   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT                   75 
Annette closes the door to the bedroom and walks down the hall passing a mirror on the wall. In the mirror's REFLECTION is Kathryn, looking very angry.

Establishing shot. 
77   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY                     77 
Sook-Hee carries a bundle of folded laundry down the hall. Sebastian enters the hallway from his bedroom. He grabs her. 
SEBASTIAN You work way to hard. Here. (hands her a wad of money) Take the day off. Merry Christmas. 
Sook-Hee smiles and moves on. Sebastian continues down the hall. He passes Kathryn's door and hear noises. 
KATHRYN (O.S.) Slower. 
Sebastian leans against the door. 
KATHRYN (O.S.) A little to the left. Look, pretend like you're writing the alphabet. A... B... mmm, stay on B. 
Sebastian knocks on the door. 
KATHRYN (O.S.) One second. 
Sebastian hears some fumbling then a door close from inside the bedroom. 
KATHRYN (O.S.) Come in. 
78   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - KATHRYN'S BEDROOM - DAY           78 
Sebastian enters the room, to find Kathryn lying in bed, wearing only her bathrobe. 
SEBASTIAN Bad time? 
KATHRYN Kind of. 
SEBASTIAN Well, you obviously wanted me to witness your little adventure or else you wouldn't have invited me in. 
Sebastian walks toward the closet. 
SEBASTIAN (cont'd) Who is our little friend so inexperienced that you have to resort to the alphabet game? 
He throws open the closet door. Ronald stands there covering his genitals with his hands. 
SEBASTIAN (cont'd) Well, well, well. 
RONALD It's not what it seems like. 
Ronald picks up his clothes. As he leaves: 
SEBASTIAN Say hi to Cecile. 
Ronald's head drops as he closes the door behind him. 
KATHRYN (calling out) Call me. 
Sebastian throws Kathryn a look. 
KATHRYN (cont'd) You can't have all the fun. 
Sebastian sits on the bed. 
KATHRYN (cont'd) You seem to be in a good mood. 
SEBASTIAN I am. 
SEBASTIAN That's not fair. You're taking all the fun out of it. 
KATHRYN Then do me a favor and get rid of her. If not for me, then do it for you. Look at yourself. You're a joke. She's turned you into jelly. What do you want to be, one of those losers who walk down the halls holding hands and smiling. People used to respect you. They feared you and now you're going to throw that all away. 
Sebastian stares at her, lost in thought. 
KATHRYN (cont'd) Poor Sebastian. He used to be cool, but now he's just another love-struck faggot. One of the many. 
80   EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - DAY                                80 
A taxi drives down the street. 
81   INT. TAXI - DAY                                            81 
Kathryn and Sebastian sit in the back seat. Her arm is around his. Sebastian looks nervous. 
KATHRYN Why so nervous? 
SEBASTIAN I've never done this before. 
KATHRYN How have you dumped girls in the past? 
SEBASTIAN Screening calls. Any suggestions? 
KATHRYN I knew this guy last summer in the Hamptons. He and his girlfriend at the time were madly in love with each other. But she had this huge weight problem. His friends taunted him mercilessly about it. You know, "How do you breathe when she sits on your face?" "It's embarrassing for you to be seen with her." Finally he couldn't take it anymore and decided to dump her. She flipped and he went on the defensive. I distinctly remember him saying the same thing over and over again. "I'm completely fucked up." "I'm completely fucked up." "I'm completely fucked up." (beat) Poor fatty never had a chance. 
82   EXT. O'SHEA APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY                       82 
The cab pulls up to the curb. Sebastian gets out and heads into the building. Kathryn leans out the window. 
KATHRYN Don't be weak. 
The cab drives off. 
83   INT. O'SHEA APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY             83 
Sebastian rings the doorbell. A woman (MRS. O'SHEA) answers the door. 
SEBASTIAN Hi. Is Annette at home? 
MRS. O'SHEA You must be Sebastian. I've heard such nice things about you. 
He smiles. 
MRS. O'SHEA (cont'd) (calling out) Annette. (to Sebastian) Come on in. 
84   INT. O'SHEA APARTMENT - FOYER - DAY                        84 
Sebastian closes the door behind him. Annette enters the room. 
ANNETTE Hi. 
SEBASTIAN Hi. 
MRS. O'SHEA Well, I'm going to head back to the kitchen. You two have fun. 
Mrs. O'Shea mouths "He's cute" to Annette. Annette smiles and nods. Mrs. O'Shea leaves the room. 
ANNETTE Would you like a tour? 
SEBASTIAN Sure. 
She takes his hand and leads him down the hall. 
85   INT. O'SHEA APARTMENT - ANNETTE'S GUEST ROOM - DAY         85 
They enter a guest room. 
ANNETTE And this is my room. 
She closes the door behind them. She smiles and kisses him. 
ANNETTE (cont'd) You think we can be quiet? 
She embraces him. Sebastian remains lifeless. 
SEBASTIAN This isn't working out for me anymore. 
ANNETTE (smiling) Yeah, me neither. 
She looks him in the eye and can tell he's not joking. 
ANNETTE (cont'd) What's wrong? 
SEBASTIAN From Ronald. 
Kathryn takes the letter. 
SEBASTIAN (cont'd) I haven't had a chance to read it, but I'm sure it goes something like "yahdah yahdah yahdah you mean a lot to me. Yahdah yahdah yahdah I hope we can be friends. Etcetera, etcetera, etcetera." You see, I expected your sort of bullshit so I took the liberty of phoning Ronald and Cecile. Right now they're having a little get together in my love shack at the Grand Central Hyatt. I'm so sorry he chose Cecile over you, but I promised him I would see you through your crisis. 
KATHRYN Well done. 
SEBASTIAN Thank you. Now, where were we? 
POP goes the champagne cork. 
SEBASTIAN (cont'd) Oh yeah, the celebration. 
He reaches down and picks up two glasses. He fills them and hands one to Kathryn. 
SEBASTIAN (cont'd) What shall we toast to? 
KATHRYN To my triumph, of course. 
SEBASTIAN Not my choice of toast, but it's your call. To your triumph over Annette. 
Kathryn giggles. 
SEBASTIAN (cont'd) What's so funny? 
KATHRYN Silly rabbit. My triumph isn't over her. It's over you. 
SEBASTIAN Come again? 
KATHRYN You were very much in love with her and you're still in love with her. But it amused me to make you ashamed of it. You gave up on the first person you ever loved because I called you names. Don't get me wrong, I'm flattered that you chose me over her, but please understand, I never loved you, Sebastian. You're just a toy. A little toy I play with. And now you've completely blown it with her. I think that's the saddest thing I've ever heard. (smiles) Cheers. 
She clicks his glass and drinks. Sebastian doesn't drink. He looks ill. 
SEBASTIAN In any event, you still owe me my reward. 
KATHRYN I'm sorry, but unfortunately I don't fuck losers. 
Sebastian slaps her across the face. 
KATHRYN (cont'd) You motherfucker! 
She grabs him and starts throwing wild punches. They fall to the ground. 
KATHRYN (cont'd) Nobody hits me. 
SEBASTIAN Calm down. 
He rolls on top of her and pins her to the ground. 
KATHRYN Get off me! 
SEBASTIAN Will you calm down? 
KATHRYN Fine! Get off me! 
He stands and gives her a hand up. They both catch their breaths. 
SEBASTIAN I'm very sorry about that. I apologize. 
KATHRYN I accept. Now get out. 
SEBASTIAN Get out? We had an arrangement. 
KATHRYN Didn't you hear what I said? 
SEBASTIAN I don't care what you said, we had an agreement. You've slept with half of the borough so don't tell me you're being choosy. 
KATHRYN (screaming) Get out! 
SEBASTIAN I'm giving you to the count of three to plop your ass down on the bed. 
KATHRYN And if I don't? 
SEBASTIAN Then I will consider it a declaration of war. One. Two... three. 
KATHRYN I think you have your answer. 
SEBASTIAN War it is. 
He grabs his journal, leaves and SLAMS the door behind him. 
89   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - SEBASTIAN'S BEDROOM - DAY         89 
RONALD What's wrong? 
KATHRYN It's Sebastian. He's out of his mind. 
RONALD What do you mean? 
KATHRYN I think he's high on drugs. He hit me, then took off. I'm afraid to be alone. Please come over. 
RONALD I'll be right there. 
He hangs up the phone and grabs his pants 
BACK TO: 
95   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - KATHRYN'S BEDROOM - DAY           95

Annette sits and stares at Sebastian's package. 
She picks it up and opens it. She takes out a journal and a letter. She opens the letter and reads it. 
SEBASTIAN (V.O.) Dear Annette. Thank you for reading this letter. I don't know what I can possibly say to rectify the harm I have caused you. For once in my life I'm at a loss for words. 
97   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - SEBASTIAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT       97 
Sebastian sits at his desk, writing the letter. 
SEBASTIAN (V.O.) The truth of the matter is that being with you was the only time I have ever been happy. My whole life has been a joke. I prided myself on taking joy in others' misery. 
98   INT. MANHATTAN STREET - NIGHT (MONTAGE)                    98 
Sebastian walks the streets of New York. He seems sad and lonely. 
SEBASTIAN (V.O.) Well, it finally backfired. I succeeded in hurting the first person I loved. I wish more than anything I could take it back, but I guess that's not possible. 
99   INT. O'SHEA APARTMENT - ANNETTE'S GUEST ROOM - NIGHT       99 
Annette continues to read the letter. 
SEBASTIAN (V.O.) Enclosed is my most prized possession... my journal. For a long time I considered it my trophy. A sordid collection of my conquests. If you really want to know the truth, then please read it. No more lies. 
100  EXT. O'SHEA APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT                     100 
We PAN down the side of the building to the ground. Sebastian lies against the building waiting for Annette to return. 
SEBASTIAN (V.O.) A car is picking me up tomorrow and taking me to Martha's Vineyard, where we have a summer home. Nothing would make me happier than if you joined me. I'm a fucking wreck without you. If you're interested please meet me outside my building at nine. If not, I understand. Love, Sebastian. 
101  INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT               101 
Ronald sits and listens as a grieving Kathryn tells her story. 
KATHRYN And when I confronted him about his affair with Cecile he told me it was none of my business. Then when I said "Well what about Ronald," he said you were nothing more than a stupid... the n word and that you deserved what you got... 
RONALD And this happened before you and I hooked up? 
KATHRYN It's been going on for a while. (beat) Then he called me a disgrace to our family and that's when he hit me. 
RONALD Racist piece of shit. 
KATHRYN I'd be careful if I were you. God knows what he's up to. 
RONALD He doesn't scare me. I'll kick his ass in. 
KATHRYN Will you stay here for the night? You can leave in the morning. That's when my parents get back and -- 
RONALD Don't worry about it. I'll stay. 
Kathryn hugs him. 
KATHRYN Thanks Ronald. You're a good friend.

Sebastian lies sleeping on a sofa in the lobby. The NIGHT DOORMAN taps him awake. 
SEBASTIAN What time is it? 
SEBASTIAN (cont'd) I'm gonna let you up, but you have to give me a chance to explain. Understood? 
Ronald nods. Sebastian releases him and Ronald catches his breath. Sebastian looks up and SEES - 
Annette, standing across the street, witnessing the event. 
SEBASTIAN (cont'd) Annette! 
Sebastian stands and races over to her, blindly crossing the street. 
Annette notices a speeding cab and - 
ANNETTE (pointing) Sebastian! 
Sebastian looks up just as -- WHAM! The taxi HITS him dead on, sending him flying over the car and onto the street. 
Annette SCREAMS. The cab SKIDS to a stop. Annette runs into the street and over to Sebastian, who lies in shock, He sees her and grabs her hand. She starts to cry. 
SEBASTIAN I'm okay. I'm okay. 
Ronald and the Cab driver run over to them. 
ANNETTE Get an ambulance! 
The cab driver races back to his car. Sebastian looks up at Annette. 
ANNETTE (cont'd) We're getting you to a hospital. 
Sebastian nods. 
SEBASTIAN Holy shit. 
ANNETTE (cont'd) You're gonna be fine. 
Sebastian nods. 
SEBASTIAN I'm sorry. 
ANNETTE (cont'd) It's alright.

Mrs. Caldwell stands in the corner with Cecile and her husband, MR. CALDWELL. 
MRS. CALDWELL Sad, sad, sad. To think of the opportunities that boy had. This should be a lesson to us all that our children need constant supervision. 
She puts her arm around Cecile. 
MRS. CALDWELL (CONT'D) It's all about quality time. 
106  INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - SEBASTIAN'S BEDROOM - DAY         106 
Annette enters Sebastian's room, now cleaned up. She walks around the room, taking it in, then approaches the window. She stares out of it for a moment. 
KATHRYN (O.S.) He loved that view. 
Annette turns and sees Kathryn at the door. She enters the room. 
ANNETTE I can see why. 
Kathryn extends her hand. 
KATHRYN I'm Kathryn. 
ANNETTE Annette Harrison. 
They shake. 
KATHRYN Have we met? 
ANNETTE I don't think so. 
KATHRYN Did you know Sebastian well? 
ANNETTE You might say that. 
KATHRYN Now I remember. Annette Harrison. Your father's the new headmaster at Oakwood.

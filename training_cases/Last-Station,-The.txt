Leo Tolstoy-   Anna Karenina 
1   EXT. COUNTRYSIDE. DAY.                                        1 
High angle of the steam train travelling through a wide river valley. The stack belching smoke against the Russian sky. 
2   INT. SECOND CLASS CARRIAGE. COUNTRY SIDE. DAY.                2 
Leo Tolstoy (80), sits writing on his lapboard. He is quite simply the greatest living writer in the world. His devotion to pacifism, his rejection of the trappings of Orthodoxy in favor of a simple Christian lifestyle convince many to regard him as a living saint. With him are his much younger wife, the COUNTESS SOFYA, favorite daughter SASHA, and his personal physician DUSHAN MAKOVITSKY. Sasha and Dushan write in their diaries. Sofya looks from one to the next a little impatient. The train begins to slow. 
SOFYA Why are we slowing down? 
No one responds. Slower. Slower. 
SOFYA We're stopping. Why are we stopping? 
SASHA I don't know, mother.    No idea. 
Tolstoy look up from his work, asks a passing conductor. 
SOFYA Excuse me, why has the train stopped? 
CONDUCTOR It's the crowd, ma'm, the people. They're blocking the track. 
In the distance we can here voices. 
VOICES (O.S.) Long live Tolstoy! Long live the old warrior! 
SOFYA But if they block the track, the train can't go...YOU HAVE TO MAKE THEM MOVE. 
The conductor shrugs, walks away. She goes to the window to investigate. A crowd of a hundred peasants, students surround the engine, block the track. They carry a huge cloth banner honoring Tolstoy. We can hear voices chanting "Tolstoy. Tolstoy. Tolstoy", voices crying "You are the truth." "You are the hope of the Russian people." 
SOFYA Oh, they won't move. We are gonna die here. Leo, Leo, go and say something to them. It's the only way we are gonna get out of here. 
The chanting grows in intensity. Tolstoy gets to his feet, walks to the window, shows himself to the crowd. A great shout goes up. Tolstoy lifts his hand for silence. Gradually, it comes. 
TOLSTOY I have seen your banner. And I´ve heard what you say. You think I´m the hope of Russia, do you? Well, that´s not true. You are the hope of Russia. The hope of all the world. You say, you want a new way to live? Well, you are not gonna find it making a fuss over me. So, I suggest that you get on with your work and let a poor old men get on with his. 
The cries begin. "Clear the tracks. Let them pass. Let them go." Tolstoy closes the door and waves to the crowd as the train pulls away. 
3   EXT. COUNTRYSIDE. DAY.                                        3 
On the chanting crowd now as the train pulls away. We focus on a handsome young man, a little stiff maybe, a little intellectual. This is VALENTIN FEDOROVITCH BULGAKOV. He can't contain his enthusiasm. Over the noise of the train. 
VALENTIN Do you know who that is? That is the greatest man in the world. 
The train pulls away into the distance. 
TITLE OVER BLACK: SPRING 1910 
4   EXT. YASNAYA POLYANA. DAWN.                                   4 
The ancestral home of the Tolstoy family in the first budding of spring. 
Muzhiks (peasants) gather wood, carry water to the house. A cart arrives loaded down with mail bags. 
5    INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. SOFYA'S BEDROOM. DAY.                   5 
A handsome room, walls covered with generations of family photographs. Religious icons are given pride of place, a testament, not to piety, but to an ingrained social conservatism, a certain position in the world. 
Countess Sofya mumbles her morning prayers before a make shift altar. Wiping away tears, she leaves the room. 
5A   INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. ENTRY/STAIR. DAY.                     5A 
Sofya walks down the stairs and through the entry passed an old servant asleep in a chair. She continues to the basement. 
Chertkov raises an eyebrow. An ominous silence. 
CHERTKOV I have another task for you, my dear. 
VALENTIN Please. 
CHERTKOV You'll keep a diary for me. 
He hands Valentin a notebook. 
CHERTKOV I need to know everything that goes on at Yasnaya Polyana. Let me know who visits the house, any talk of the copyright to his work, any contact with the church, what letters come and go. (beat) Anything Sofya Andreyevna says. 
VALENTIN Anything? 
CHERTKOV She's very, very dangerous. 
9    EXT. MOSCOW. DOORWAY/STREET. EVENING.                         9 
Chertkov kisses Valentin delicately on both cheeks and ushers him into the dying light. 
CHERTKOV Godspeed, my boy. 
Valentin makes his way to the droshky that awaits him. 
CHERTKOV And remember what I said. 
He turns back to the dark figure in the doorway. 
CHERTKOV Write everything down! Go! 
10   EXT. YASNAYA POLYANA. GROUNDS. MORNING.                       10 
SOFYA. Black and white film of her being handed the newspapers at the step. She looks up at the camera, irritated by its presence. 
CUTTING OUT TO COLOR we see a cinematographer on the lawn cranking away at his camera. She goes into the house. 
11   INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. TOLSTOY'S BEDROOM/STUDY. MORNING.       11 
Where Tolstoy, awake and dressed, sits on his bed, pen in hand, writing in his diary. Dushan sits next to him, taking his pulse. 
TOLSTOY Nothing's working... Hand me my other boot, my friend, will you? 
DUSHAN Let me finish. 
TOLSTOY It doesn't matter. If my heart had stopped beating, I'd still go riding today. 
DUSHAN Your pulse is my responsibility... (MORE) 
DUSHAN (cont'd) and if you must ride, I insist you wear a coat. Even the sun is cold today. 
He puts Tolstoy's arm down and hands him his riding boot. Sofya comes ranting into the room carrying several Russian and international dailies. 
SOFYA This is impossible! It really is! These people are parasites! Look... (reading) "Countess Tolstoy has become estranged from her husband. They barely speak." 
She throws the paper on the floor. 
SOFYA You know who spreads all this rubbish.... 
She opens another paper, a French daily. 
SOFYA C'est la meme en France. They gossip about us in Paris... "They do not share a similar view of either religion or politics." Incroyable! 
TOLSTOY (smiling) Peut-etre. You think that's inaccurate? 
SOFYA I think it's none of the world's business. 
She looks at Dushan who is transcribing every word into his diary. He does it with all the master's conversations. 
SOFYA What are you doing? Don't do that. 
TOLSTOY (smiling) Dushan Petrovich, you're scribbling again? 
Tolstoy moves with energy and purpose toward the door. 
SOFYA Darling, where are you going? 
TOLSTOY Riding with Sasha. Don't expect us for lunch. 
Seven miles from Tolstoy's estate, this is Telyatinki, a communal center created by Chertkov dedicated to the study and practice of Tolstoyism. 
SERGEYENKO Telyatinki was created by Vladimir Grigorevich as a center for the movement. Just last week we had a visitor from India. We talked to the group about the healing properties of cobra venum. 
VALENTIN Oh, goodness..It's a beautiful day. 
SERGEYENKO Yes, but we will pay for it. 
Sergeyenko, Chertkov's joyless secretary, and Valentin stand on a second storey porch looking out across the central lawn where a number of young Tolstoyans tend the garden, work to put up a chicken coop. 
SERGEYENKO The meeting room is behind us. This is the tool shed. The dormitory ahead. 
He points out a larger building across the way. 
17   INT. TELYATINKI. SLEEPING AREA. NIGHT.                  17 
They enter the building. 
SERGEYENKO Telyatinki is a place of freedom. Nothing is forbidden here. 
Except everything. 
SERGEYENKO Each man is alone with his conscience and his God. (beat) The kitchen is below. You'll be expected to assist with meals at least twice a week ...and to give a hand in the garden. We're all equals here, you know...as Tolstoy teaches us. 
They start up the stairs. 
INT. SLEEPING PORCH. TELYATINKI. DAY 
SERGEYENKO 
You are expected at Yasnaya Polyana in the morning, first thing. 
VALENTIN I look forward to it. 
SERGEYENKO Yes... you're lucky....We're all envious. 
18   INT. TELYATINKI. VALENTIN'S ROOM: NIGHT                      18 
Small, sparse, perfect for the novice ascetic.   Valentin nods his approval. 
SERGEYENKO Vladimir Grigorevich is anxious that you begin your reports as soon as possible. You have the notebook he gave you? 
VALENTIN Of course. 
SERGEYENKO You understand we must keep the existence of the diary a secret. 
Valentin smiles. 
SERGEYENKO What is it? 
VALENTIN Just that...secrecy doesn't seem to me the essence of Tolstoy's thought. 
SERGEYENKO But you'll admit, you're no expert. 
VALENTIN Yes, I...I'll see you in the morning. 
SERGEYENKO If we're spared. 
Sergeyenko leaves Valentin to his bare, little room. 
19   EXT. TELYATINKI COMPOUND. MORNING.                           19 
The sun rising. Already, disciples are at work the gardens. 
20   INT. TELYATINKI. VALENTIN'S ROOM. MORNING.                   20 
Valentin sleeps in his tiny room. A knock on the door. 
VALENTIN Come in. 
A lovely girl at his door. She's tall, twenties, high cheek bones, short blonde hair. This is MASHA. 
MASHA I've brought you a glass of tea. 
VALENTIN That's very kind of you. 
MASHA It's your first day. Enjoy it. 
Tolstoy nods. 
TOLSTOY I've become convinced that all the world's religions have a single organizing principle. Can you guess what it is? Love! Love! Simple... Now, I want to talk about you. How are you? How was your journey? Come, sit down. 
Tolstoy sits on the old sofa. Valentin follows suit. 
TOLSTOY You know, I was born on this sofa... 
Valentin gets right back up. Tolstoy laughs, pats the sofa. 
TOLSTOY Sit. Sit. 
Valentin sits down. 
TOLSTOY Myself, my brother, my children, at least five or six of them, right here. (beat) Now, I've read your essays. How`s your work progressing? 
Valentin looks into the great man's kind old face. He tries to speak but he's overcome with emotion and begins to weep. 
TOLSTOY My boy, what is it? (beat) I upset you in some way. Was it the sofa? It's only a sofa. 
Valentin shakes his head, smiling through his tears. 
VALENTIN I'm very happy. You are very kind. I'm no one and you are... you are Leo Tolstoy and you ask me about my work. 
Tolstoy takes Valentin's hand, sits him back on sofa. 
TOLSTOY You rest for a moment and I'll fetch you a glass of tea. Rest, because there's work for both of us together. 
He smiles and goes, leaving Valentin to contemplate his fortune.

28   EXT. YASNAYA POLYANA. GROUNDS. DAY.                           28 
Sofya, Sasha, Valentin, ANDREY, Tolstoy's son, and Tolstoy all clustered around a table taking tea. Dushan stands near the group fiddling with a gramophone that sits on a small table. 
SOFYA These people have nothing. 
DUSHAN It really is the most extraordinary thing. 
Absolutely ignoring him. 
SOFYA It's not for lack of land that the muzhiks live in poverty. They have no will power and they drink too much. 
TOLSTOY I'm not suggesting they be given land. Private property is the root of the problem... We should be giving ours away. 
ANDREY Give it to whom? 
SOFYA It's all ridiculous. You think that poverty makes the peasants somehow morally superior. 
TOLSTOY I believe that wealth corrupts us all, yes I do. 
A pause.   Valentin fills the silence. 
VALENTIN It's a keystone of the movement. 
SOFYA Oh, I know all about the movement. 
A pause. Valentin notices that people from the front lawn have moved up to watch all this. Life in the fishbowl, the Tolstoys seem neither to notice nor care. 
TOLSTOY If the peasants had money, they wouldn't surround themselves, as we do, with footmen costing ten rubles a month. 
SOFYA No, they'd spend it on drink and whores. 
TOLSTOY Valentin Fedorovich, do you think fifty years from now, people will eat while grown men walk around and wait on them hand and foot? 
Valentin doesn't know what to say. A giggle from Dushan. 
DUSHAN Oh, that's good...that's good. 
Dushan, having sat at table, tries surreptitiously to get down Tolstoy's words in the diary he holds below the table. Sofya flushes with anger. 
VALENTIN I think...(sneeze) 
VALENTIN I don't. Not at all...I think sexual activity...how men and women combine their physical parts is completely neutral. 
MASHA Listen to you. You're a prig. Just like Sergeyenko. Why else would they have hired you? 
VALENTIN That's not fair 
MASHA I don't care if it's fair. It's true...neutral...my God... 
VALENTIN I'm going. 
He puts down the axe. 
MASHA Do as you like. 
She goes back to chopping. We track in front of him as he walks toward the house. The chopping stops. 
MASHA Valentin Fedorovich. 
He stops, relieved and turns to face her. 
MASHA You forgot your horse. 
VALENTIN Yes. You know, I think that I... never mind. 
He hesitates for a moment, then starts toward her. Her back is to him. She begins to chop again. The color rises in his face as he tries to salvage a little dignity. 
He grabs the reins and starts again toward the buildings, trips in a ditch, almost falls flat. Red faced, he rights himself. The chopping behind him remains constant. Sergeyenko watches him from the porch. 
32    INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. LIBRARY. DAY                           32 
CLOSE on the CABLE MACHINE.    A message coming through. 
32A   INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. ENTRY WAY/STAIR. DAY.                  32A 
Sofya walks into the house with another stack of mail. Sasha comes piling down the stairs. 
SASHA Where's papa? 
Without waiting for the answer, Sasha races past her and out the door 
33    OMITTED                                                      33 
34    EXT. YASNAYA POLYANA. ZASYEKA WOODS. DAY                     34 
Valentin and Tolstoy walk together in the woods. . 
TOLSTOY I couldn't write. I was distracted I think...I had a dream last night, about a Tartar girl I knew in the war. 
VALENTIN A girl who died? 
TOLSTOY No, no...A girl I had sexual intercourse with... Sometimes we did it twice a day. 
Valentin sneezes. 
TOLSTOY God bless...I've never forgotten our time together, the position of our bodies, the taste of her... 
VALENTIN You shouldn't torture yourself. It was a long time ago. 
Tolstoy laughs out loud. 
TOLSTOY Torture? You are a virgin, aren't you. 
VALENTIN I try to...you know, to... 
TOLSTOY To be what, a good Tolstoyan? 
Tolstoy smiles. 
TOLSTOY You see, I myself am not a very good Tolstoyan. You should think twice about asking my advice about anything... Torture... (he laughs) 
VALENTIN Are you alright? 
TOLSTOY Kalya, her name was...She's an old woman now, white hair, old body like me. She'd hardly remember my name, I suspect. She may even be dead. (beat) Do you think that meant something? 
VALENTIN What do you mean? 
TOLSTOY I mean that little romance. Was there some meaning to it? 
CHERTKOV Sofya Andreyevna, I'm happy to see you. 
Valentin watches her match him smile for smile.                    * 
SOFYA And I'm happy to make you happy...always.

41   EXT. ROAD TO TELYATINKI. DAY                                  41 
Valentin and Chertkov sit together in the droshky, an awkward silence. 
CHERTKOV I'm glad to have a moment alone with you, Valentin. How do you think you're getting on? 
VALENTIN (a little nervous) I hope my work is pleasing to Leo Nikolayevich. 
CHERTKOV Yes. He seems satisfied and that's good. The reports I've received from you however... There seems to be some confusion. 
VALENTIN What do you mean? 
CHERTKOV You send me never ending commentary on Tolstoy's writing. That's all very interesting but not very useful. I need to know what goes on with Sofya Andreyevna. You must see by now she's committed to undermining her husband's best intentions. 
VALENTIN It's not quite so obvious to me. 
CHERTKOV Because she is duplicitous. You are very bright. Too bright to let her into you. 
Chertkov fixes the boy with his intense gaze. 
CHERTKOV You value our work? 
VALENTIN I do. 
CHERTKOV The ideals we share? 
VALENTIN That's why I'm here. 
CHERTKOV Good, of course it is. (beat) Do you think the Countess suspects something? 
VALENTIN Well, I think the Countess is very suspicios by nature. 
CHERTKOV How so? 
VALENTIN I don´t think she likes you very much. 
CHERTKOV What does she say? 
VALENTIN It´s a tone I´ve picked up. 
CHERTKOV We simply want to distribute Tolstoy's work to the widest audience possible. She just has no understanding what it is we are trying to do. There´s nothing in it for any of us but a real chance to increase the world´s happiness. 
He takes Valentin's hand. 
CHERTKOV I can only be of limited help to the master if I don't know what's going on. Any effort she makes to shore up control of the copyright, I must know. The survival of our movement depends on it. Remember who your friends are. What you've come here to do. 
Chertkov turns away to watch the countryside. Valentin stares straight ahead, his nose twitches slightly.

47   INT. TELYATINKI. VALENTIN'S ROOM. NIGHT.                     47 
Valentin, in bed, writes in his diary. Closing his eyes, he begins to drift off when there is a noise outside his door. 
VALENTIN Hello... Hello? 
After a moment, it opens a crack. 
VALENTIN Masha? 
She is there. She puts two fingers to her lips and walks toward him. She carries a candle which reveals her short hair, her lovely eyes. 
VALENTIN (O.S.) At the moment, I'm indisposed. 
SERGEYENKO Yes, well...Leo Nikolayevich is here. He want s to see you. 
49B   INT. TELYATINKI. VALENTIN'S ROOM. DAY.               49B 
Valentin blanches. 
VALENTIN Tell him... I'll be down at once. 
SERGEYENKO (O.S.) Yes..and tell Maria Filipovna we could use another hand in the kitchen. 
They look at each other. 
VALENTIN If I see her I will... 
SERGEYENKO (O.S.) If you see her...yes. And if you're going to behave like rabbits, you should go live in the woods. 
Valentin is up, immediately. 
VALENTIN Let me go out first...give me five minutes... 
Masha just looks at him. 
50   EXT. TELYATINKI COMPOUND. DAY.                               50 
A Tolstoyan photo op. A delegation of orphans have come to pay their respects to Tolstoy. He sits in a chair beside Chertkov beneath a large banner : "Leo Tolstoy, Friend of the People.". Behind him, the disciples lay out a vegetarian feast on a plank table. Photographers and a cinematographer are strategically positioned to record the event. 
Each child gives Tolstoy a flower. Chertkov, in turn, hands each child a photograph of the Count giving money to the poor. 
Valentin enters, flushed and blushing. He pauses beside Dushan who records the scene in his diary, tears in his eyes. 
DUSHAN Look at the love in him, like Jesus..suffering the children...all that... 
Tolstoy greets a little boy affectionately, rubs his knuckles over the boy's shaved head. A little girl approaches, takes a photograph. He bends forward to kiss her head but she pulls away. 
TOLSTOY An old man is a very ugly thing. 
Tolstoy sees Valentin, lights up. 
TOLSTOY My dear boy. Come and kiss me. 
Valentin, beet red, goes to him. He is warmly embraced. 
TOLSTOY Now, who is this? Maria Filipovna. 
Masha comes to stand beside him. She glances at Valentin but he won't make eye contact with her. 
TOLSTOY You're both looking so well. Life here at Telyatinki obviously agrees with you. 
Valentin sneezes mightily, moves a little away. 
TOLSTOY God bless you, boy. What are you nervous about, now? Sit down. Sit down. 
Valentin takes the chair beside him. 
TOLSTOY Dear Masha, Valentin tells me you're the great treasure of Telyatinki. He claims you're a very gifted teacher. 
Sergeyenko lifts an eyebrow "Indeed.". Valentin is in agony. 
MASHA We're happy to have you with us. 
Tolstoy notices a mosquito on Valentin's cheek. He takes the bug between his big fingers, squeezes until it pops. Chertkov watches in horror, whispers loudly. 
CHERTKOV What are you doing? 
TOLSTOY What do you mean? 
He motions to the photographers. 
CHERTKOV You've killed a living thing. 
Chertkov hears a laugh behind him.   It is Masha who has over heard the whole thing. 
CHERTKOV Do you have something to say? 
MASHA It's absurd. That's all. 
SOFYA Let me make you crow. 
A pause, then a huge laugh comes up from the very center of him. He twists his neck, thrusts his head upward, crows like a rooster. 
He virtually runs to her, embraces her, kisses her. She is a giddy girl in his arms. He breaks the embrace and begins strutting around the room. 
SOFYA Let me make you sing. 
He takes her in his arms, again, begins to kiss her neck. 
SOFYA Do you love me? 
TOLSTOY I do. 
SOFIA I want you to love me. 
He stops kissing her, looks her in the eye. Then, another loud crow. Laughing, they fall into each other again. 
53A   EXT. YASNAYA POLYANA. GROUNDS. NIGHT.                       53A 
And we hear their laughter over the dark old house. 
54   EXT. TELYATINKI. PORCH. NIGHT.                             54 
Valentin sits by himself on the porch, writes in his diary. Down below, some of the disciples listen to peasants play music around a bonfire. A voice from the darkness. 
MASHA I'm not supposed to do this either. 
He locates the speaker by the glow of her lit cigarette. 
VALENTIN Masha. You are not supposed to smoke at Telyatinki. 
MASHA You wouldn't look at me. 
VALENTIN It was difficult in front of the others. 
MASHA But it wasn't difficult in your bed... When it was only you and me in front of God. 
VALENTIN I'm not sure I was conscious of God. 
Masha emerges from the shadows, but keeps her distance. 
MASHA So, I made you forget God? 
VALENTIN No... 
MASHA Yes, only for a moment. You forgot your rules and remembered love. 
VALENTIN You make it sound very simple. 
MASHA It is simple. What we did is what men and women do, have done, will continue doing. What could be more simple? We touched each other-- stayed close together. Something passed between us. Something real. That is a betrayal of what? Of nothing. (MORE) 
MASHA (cont'd) But you're afraid... All your ideas. What are you afraid of? 
VALENTIN I'm afraid I've hurt you, haven´t I? 
MASHA No. I feel a little sad, but it is not for me. It's for you. 
She disappears into the house. Valentin looks after her. 
55   INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. SOFYA'S BEDROOM. MORNING.             55 
The Countess wakes to find her bed empty. 
56   EXT. YASNAYA POLYANA. BACK TERRACE. DAY.                    56 
She comes through the dining room to find Tolstoy on the back terrace. Wrapped in a blanket, he writes in his diary, a cup of tea in front of him. 
SOFYA Good morning, my darling? Do you mind if I join you? 
Without looking up 
TOLSTOY Of course, my dear. 
He continues to write. She watches him for a long moment. She opens her diary and begins to write as well. 
SOFYA It's quite insane, my darling. Everyone is making fun of you. 
MASHA Fine...fine...Why did you...? 
VALENTIN I came back as soon as I could. It was a strange day. Leo Nikolayevich,...I love to listen to him. I love nothing more... 
He moves closer to her. 
VALENTIN But today I could hardly concentrate. 
He's very close to her, now. 
VALENTIN All I could think of was you. 
Masha shakes her head, moves away from him. Begins to gather the pole, to refill the spilled bucket. Stops her, turns her to him. 
VALENTIN What's wrong? 
MASHA I think I've confused you. I've confused us both. 
VALENTIN No. No. You didn´t confuse me..I was stupid. I was afraid, but I'm not afraid anymore. 
Valentin wants to fight through the awkwardness. He tries to kiss her. She won't have it. She pulls away. 
VALENTIN I love you, Masha! 
MASHA Maybe you could help me a little. 
In silence, he gets the filled buckets balanced on the pole. Without another word, Masha starts toward the buildings. He doesn't know what to do. He's losing her. He shouts. 
VALENTIN Masha... 
She turns 
VALENTIN Before the other night...I'd committed the act of copulation many times in my heart. 
He has her attention now, as well as that of a number of the disciples who look up from their work in the yard. 
MASHA Yes... 
VALENTIN I think about you all the time. In my heart I´ve comitted the act of copulation many times. I just want to say...It was never like it was with you. 
Masha bursts out laughing. 
MASHA I'll wait for you, then. 
As Valentin goes to catch her up, he sees Sergeyenko watching from outside the unfinished chicken coop.

67   INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. SOFYA'S BEDROOM. MORNING.              67 
Sofya wakes up. She looks relaxed, then she sniffs, sniffs again. Out of bed, she grabs a dressing gown. Opening her door, she spots Ivan in the hall. 
SOFYA Ivan, who's wearing that awful perfume? 
Ivan a gesture indicating an elaborate moustache. She steps into the hall in time to see Tolstoy, Chertkov, Valentin and Sasha disappear into the library, ducks back into her room to avoid being seen 
68   INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. HALLWAY. DAY                           68 
Sofya approaches the door, listens. She can make out only a few words. "Mama cannot find out", Chertkov shushing her, whispers. We push in on Sofya's anxious face. 
69    INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. LIBRARY. DAY.                         69 
Chertkov, Sasha, Dushan, Valentin and Tolstoy sit in a little clump by his desk. Tolstoy his head in his hands, looks at the floor. 
CHERTKOV I hate to say it but the Countess has become more and more dangerous. 
TOLSTOY Not dangerous... She's concerned for the welfare of the family. 
CHERTKOV (to Tolstoy) And we're concerned for the welfare of mankind. (to Bulgakov) Take this down. 
Valentin records the conversation in his diary. 
TOLSTOY It´s a terrible thing you ask. I can´t do it. 
70    INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. SOFYA'S BEDROOM. DAY.                 70 
Sofya, still in her dressing gown, climbs out her bedroom window onto a narrow ledge that runs along the second floor. 
SASHA Mama, please... 
She rips the book away and after brandishing it above her head, throws it through the open doors with a guttural, rumbling growl. She turns on her tormentors. 
SOFYA Now... 
TOLSTOY (mumbles) Can I not...Can I not have... 
His face is red, his body rigid with anger. 
SASHA You'll kill him, Mama. That's what you want, isn't it? You want him to die!" 
She helps him up, takes him to his bedroom. Valentin follows. 
She looks at Chertkov. 
SOFYA You! Don't think you deceive me for one little moment! I know exactly what you're doing. I want to see the will. It's my right, in the name of god. 
CHERTKOV What are you afraid of? 
SOFYA You.   I'm afraid of you. 
Chertkov looks at her with undisguised disgust. 
CHERTKOV The press is bloodthirsty. Had I wished, I could've demolished you and your family. You make it easy. 
SOFYA Tell them anything you like. Go ahead. Ruin us. 
CHERTKOV I have too much respect for Leo Nikolayevich. You're lucky. 
SOFYA Why can't my husband see you for what you are? 
Chertkov's face is red. He starts to speak, stops. He walks to the door, then very deliberately. 
CHERTKOV If I had a wife like you, I would have blown my brains out long ago. (beat) Or gone to America. 
He leaves the room. Sofya sinks back to the floor, a flower wilting. She begins to weep. An Aria from Madame Butterfly comes over 
78   INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. DINING ROOM. NIGHT.                    78 
From a record on the gramophone. The table is set for ten, although no one is at dinner but Sofya Andreyevna and Valentin. He is visibly uncomfortable. An awkward silence. 
VALENTIN I hope you're feeling better. 
SOFYA Do you like the opera? 
VALENTIN I took singing lessons for years. I thought about a career in music. The only thing I lacked, in the end, was talent. (beat) I'm sorry about everything. 
She smiles. 
SOFYA This aria is very beautiful.. It is about a woman who is abandoned by the man who loves her...Everyone is very moved by that...in the opera. 
A long pause. The clink of soup spoons.   Tolstoy enters. He doesn't sit. 
TOLSTOY Our life together has become intolerable. 
Stifling a sneeze, Valentin gets up to leave,tries to flee the inappropriateness of all this. 
SOFYA Sit down, Valentin. 
VALENTIN Really, I'm expected at Telyatinki. 
She waves it off. 
SOFYA No, no, no. Enjoy your dinner. We've had a disagreement. No more than any other married couple. 
TOLSTOY I didn't come for more recrimination. Despite good cause for alienation between us, I have never stopped loving you. 
SOFYA Of course... 
TOLSTOY God knows you don't make it easy. 
SOFYA Why should it be easy? I'm the work of your life. You're the work of mine. Its what love is. 
Aside to Valentin. 
SOFYA Everything with him is hysterics 
VALENTIN What? 
He gets up, goes to her. 
MASHA Chertkov spoke with me this afternoon. He says I could be more useful there...which means... 
Valentin shakes his head. His lip trembles. 
VALENTIN This is him punishing us, punishing me for befriending Sofya Andreyevna. For not... This is Chertkov. 
MASHA We've both disappointed him. 
VALENTIN I don't care. You can't go away. I'll talk to him. I'll make him change his mind. i´m going to make you stay. 
MASHA No, I want to go. 
VALENTIN What? 
MASHA I'm leaving the movement. 
VALENTIN You can´t leave Tolstoy. 
MASHA I am not. Look, when I read his Confession, it moved me, Valya. He was searching for freedom. Freedom from anger. Freedom from attachment. Freedom from all the superstition and nonsense of the church. It moved me so much. I thought that's what it would be about. Isn't that what it's about? Freedom and love? But they mix it all up. 
Masha reaches out and puts her arms around him. Her head falls against his shoulder. 
MASHA Come with me. Please. 
Bulgakov doesn't know what to say. The silence gets more awkward as it gets longer. Slowly, she disengages herself from him,looks him in the eye. She nods. 
MASHA I'm going to my room. 
As she starts away. 
VALENTIN Don't leave me, Masha... I need you. 
She turns back for a moment. 
MASHA I know you do...I know. 
Then she's gone. 
82   INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. SOFYA'S BEDROOM/HALLWAY. DAY.          82 
Sofya in her bed. A team of doctors hover over her. One of them peers into her eyes with a sextant-like instrument. 
We move into the hall to find DR. ROSSOLIMO, an expert in mental illness, conferring in the hall with Tolstoy and Dushan. 
ROSSOLIMO I believe the Countess suffers from a mental degeneracy, paranoic and hysterical, chiefly the former. 
DUSHAN Yes. 
The doctor walks back into the bedroom. Tolstoy red in the face, walks away down the hall. Dushan catches him. 
TOLSTOY Why did you bring him here? 
DUSHAN He's an old friend, you know, from Rome. 
TOLSTOY And astoundingly stupid in the way of all scientists. 
Dushan is wounded by his uncharacteristic lack of generosity. 
TOLSTOY I'm sorry, my friend, but this is all very upsetting to me. 
DUSHAN Yes. 
Tolstoy sits on a small staircase at the end of the hall. Bulgakov is already there on the step above him. 
TOLSTOY Take them downstairs. Thank them for me. Offer them a drink. 
DUSHAN You'll be alright? 
TOLSTOY Valentin Fedorovich will stay with me, won't you, boy 
Valentin nods. Dushan goes to collect the doctors. 
MOMENTS LATER-Tolstoy goes to Sofya's bed. He takes her hand. She looks at him with all the love of a new bride. Tears come to his eyes. He kisses her hand. 
VALENTIN Do you love your wife? 
TOLSTOY " Your youth and your desire for happiness reminds me cruelly of my age and the impossibility of happiness for me." When I was courting Sofya, she was so young and pure, it seemed impossible that I'd ever have her. I didn't want to tell her how I felt and I wanted to tell her nothing else. So I wrote down a string of letters and asked her if she could decipher them. She looked completely confused, thinking it was a game or... 
Tolstoy looks into the middle distance, remembering his love. 
TOLSTOY I gave her one clue. The first two Y's, I said, stand for "your youth" and then the most miraculous thing happened. She simply spoke the phrase, my phrase... 
Tolstoy looks at Valentin as if the boy might offer some explanation of the miraculous. 
TOLSTOY ...as if she had read my mind. In that moment, we both knew we would always be together. For those first years, we were incredibly happy, terrifyingly happy. 
His old eyes are wet. 
TOLSTOY And now this. 
Tolstoy reaches into his boot, extracts his SECRET DIARY. He takes a pen from his shirt, begins to write. Valentin is amazed. HE HAD A PEN ALL THE TIME. 
85   INT. TELYATINKI. MEETING ROOM. NIGHT.                          85 
Valentin exhausted, sits at the long table.   Chertkov appears at his office door. 
CHERTKOV Thank you again, Valentin Fedorovich, for your forethought. 
VALENTIN I'm a secretary, after all. 
Chertkov let's it go. 
CHERTKOV You know I had thought for a time to suggest that Leo Nikolayevich look for someone else. But...he said no. He said "He reminds me of myself when I was young." 
He goes. After a moment, Valentin gets up and goes to the study door. 
VALENTIN I'm leaving Telyatinki. 
CHERTKOV Really. 
VALENTIN I am going to Moscow. 
CHERTKOV She is leading you around the nose. 
VALENTIN Look, you say the movement's about love- 
CHERTKOV Yes... The love he tells us to practice, the love of the Gospels. Why do I have to explain this? Perfect love. Eternal love. The love that binds mankind together. 
VALENTIN But I've never met mankind, only men and women, imperfect men, imperfect women. 
CHERTKOV Leo Nikolayevich also teaches us love can not be weakminded. Go. You won't be missed ...a naive sentimentalist 
Valentin looks at him for a long moment, then bursts out laughing, walks away 
CHERTKOV Why are you laughing? You think I'm ridiculous. 
VALENTIN I'm laughing because I didn't sneeze.

89   INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. TOLSTOY STUDY/BEDROOM. DAY.            89 
Tolstoy has fallen asleep at his desk, his SECRET DIARY open before him. Sofya enters without knocking. He bolts up groggily, tries to hide the little book. Sofya, meanwhile, holds up the letter in her hand. 
SOFYA Lyovochka? Prozeveskeny wants to purchase the rights to your work after your death. 
TOLSTOY Then I shall try and die as soon as is convenient. 
SOFYA Don't be silly. They've offered one million rubles. 
Silence. 
SOFYA How can you not be pleased? 
TOLSTOY I don't write for publishers. I write for people. 
He gets up from his desk. 
TOLSTOY Essentials only. Nothing that isn't absolutely necessary. 
Valentin struggles to close a case full of books and papers. 
TOLSTOY Please...we must hurry. 
VALENTIN Where will you go? 
No one responds. Dushan comes to Tolstoy, sits down and begins the ritual taking of the pulse. Meanwhile, Sasha wraps a heavy fur coat around his shoulders. She smiles at him. 
SASHA Absolutely essential. 
DUSHAN A lantern, I think. It's very dark tonight. (beat) And the apparatus for giving an enema. 
96   EXT. YASNAYA POLYANA. GROUNDS. NIGHT.                        96 
The horses are hitched to the droshky, the bags are up on the back. 
SASHA Everything's ready. 
Dushan climbs into the carriage. Tolstoy turns abruptly and walks back toward the house. 
SASHA Papa...? 
DUSHAN He's changed his mind. He's going back to the house. 
They watch as Tolstoy kneels on the wet grass, bending low to rub his hands against the earth. After a moment, Valentin goes to him, kneels next to him. 
VALENTIN Do you want to go back? 
TOLSTOY When I was a boy, my brother Nikolai once brought me to a place when I was a boy. He told me he'd found a green stick with some words on it... the secret to happiness for all men everywhere. He hid it in the ground. I looked for it very often. I've looked for it all these years. I really believed I would find it here...but I never did. 
Tolstoy looks at him. 
TOLSTOY I never did...but this life is behind me now. 
He kisses the ground of his beloved home, gets up and they walk back to the droshky. 
TOLSTOY Help me up, will you? 
As they go, he hands Valentin an envelope. 
TOLSTOY Give this to Sofya. 
VALENTIN I will. 
They reach the carriage. Sasha embraces him, kisses him over and over. 
SASHA Be well. Be well. 
TOLSTOY Don't cry. I'll send for you when I can. 
They help him up onto the droshky and the carriage starts slowly away from the old house. 
97   EXT. YASNAYA POLYANA. GROUNDS. MORNING                       97 
Out in front of the house, an old peasant woman pulls the feathers off a chicken. Over her impassive face, we hear deep, heavy sobs. 
98   INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. SITTING ROOM. DAY.                     98 
Sofya is in a rage. Sasha sits nearby. 
SASHA I'm simply telling you what happened. He's gone. I have no idea where. Nobody does. 
SOFYA You're a liar. (beat) Liar! 
Sasha won't rise to the bait. 
Valentin comes into the room. 
SOFYA So, he's gone. (to Bulgakov) For good. 
VALENTIN I think so, yes. 
There is a pause. Sofya suddenly smiles, becomes solicitous. 
SOFY Darling Sasha, where is your father? I know you know. Please, please. Don't play games with me. Now it´s not the moment. 
Ivan looks at Sasha for approval. 
SASHA I see no harm in it. Let's get her to bed. 
Valentin nods. Ivan appears beside him. 
IVAN Life returns to torture her for awhile. 
He laughs out loud,then walks away. 
101   INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. DINING ROOM. DAY.                      101 
Sasha walks into dining room. Valentin pours them tea. 
SASHA She's exhausted herself. She's slept for nearly four hours. 
VALENTIN I'm glad she can sleep. The pain subsides a little. 
SASHA The noise subsides a little. 
They smile at each other. 
SASHA Well, a little. 
Ivan comes down the stairs. He stops in the doorway. 
SASHA Come in. 
IVAN A message, miss. 
SASHA For me? 
IVAN No, for your father. From the Countess, miss. 
SASHA She's allowed to send a note to my father. I just don't know where to tell her to send it. 
IVAN She's addressed it to train number 9. That's the train the master took. The station master told me... 
SASHA Why are you giving it to me? She is allowed to send my father a note! 
Ivan steps forward and hands her the note to inspect. Sasha can't help but laugh. 
SASHA She never gives up. (reading the note) "Dearest papa. Return at once. (MORE) 
SASHA (cont'd) Sasha." She signed it with my name. 
VALENTIN Ingenious. 
SASHA Obvious. 
She pockets the note. Ivan continues to stand there. Sasha looks at him. 
SASHA Yes? 
IVAN He gave me this as well...the stationmaster. A note for you. 
Sasha opens it, reads. She looks up, flushed with excitement. 
SASHA He's with my aunt.      At the Shamardino. 
Sasha runs out of the room. 
102   EXT. YASNAYA POLYANA. GROUNDS. DAY                          102 
Sasha, on horse back, rides up and by the camera and away down the alley of trees that lead away from the house. 
SOFYA (O.S.) They've all gone 
103   INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. LIBRARY. DAY.                         103 
Sitting at his desk, Valentin looks up to see Sofya standing in the doorway. She looks exhausted. 
VALENTIN I'm here. 
She walks to his desk. 
SOFYA You're writing to your girl. That's lovely. 
DUSHAN I know. Stay back. 
Tolstoy stirs. 
TOLSTOY Where are we? 
DUSHAN It's alright. Everything's fine. 
He reaches out to touch Tolstoy's forehead. He goes pale. 
TOLSTOY Where are we? 
DUSHAN Let me take your temperature. 
The old man lifts his shirt, takes the thermometer under his arm. Dushan reaches for his wrist. Valentin and Sasha look at each other, wait for the vital signs. He takes the thermometer from Tolstoy, reads it. 
He's clearly shaken. 
TOLSTOY Good old Dushan,...you needn't worry. Remember, you are my doctor, not my angel. Whatever happens, it's not your fault... I'm feeling much better now. I just need to sleep. 
DUSHAN Good, good. Yes. 
He drifts off again, Dushan stares at the thermometer. His eyes fill with tears. 
DUSHAN He will be fine. 
114   EXT. ASTAPOVO. PLATFORM. DAY                                 114 
The train pulls into a small, dusty station, ASTAPOVO. 
Valentin and Dushan support, help him off the train.   Sasha looks at the sad, empty platform. 
SASHA We've come to the end of the world. 
115   EXT. ASTAPOVO. PLATFORM. DAY.                                115 
Dushan and Tolstoy sit on a bench on the platform. Sasha and Valentin appear. 
VALENTIN The stationmaster says we may have his house for as long as we need it. There are no inns nearby, so we're lucky. 
TOLSTOY Very lucky. 
DUSHAN Yes. 
They help Tolstoy up. A little bearded man, the station master, waits to escort them. 
SASHA You'll be comfortable here, papa. The rest of us...we'll find cots or sleep in the station. 
TOLSTOY And then we'll be on our way. 
116   OMITTED                                                      116

118   INT. ASTAPOVO. TELEGRAPH OFFICE. NIGHT.                      118 
Valentin approaches the operator. 
VALENTIN Hello, hello? Could you send a cable for me? 
119   INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. LIBRARY. NIGHT                        119 
A message comes over the cable machine. 
VALENTIN (O.S.) Tolstoy ill at Astapovo. Temperature high. Send it to Sofya Andreyevna, Yasnaya Polyana. 
120   INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. SITTING ROOM. NIGHT.                  120 
Sofya paces. Andrey lolls on the couch reading the paper. 
SOFYA We must leave at once. 
ANDREY We'll make inquiries in the morning, mother. 
SOFYA We'll rent a train. 
ANDREY That'll cost a fortune. 
Valentin goes to Tolstoy. He's in a kind of panic. Chertkov comes into the room. 
TOLSTOY She's come, hasn't she? She`s here. 
He points to the corner.   But it is nothing, a gray shape thrown by a coat rack. 
CHERTKOV You're imagining things. 
DUSHAN It's true, Leo Nikolayevich. 
TOLSTOY Sasha...where's your mother? 
Tolstoy's eyes fill with tears. Valentin looks to Sasha. She looks from him to Chertkov. 
CHERTKOV She's at home. 
TOLSTOY If she wanted to see me I couldn't refuse her. (beat) Is she going to come here? 
All eyes are on Sasha. 
SASHA I don't think so...I don't know, Papa. There's no way to... 
TOLSTOY To what? 
Will she waiver?    A long, agonizing beat. 
SASHA She's at home. I'm sure of it. 
Valentin looks at the floor. 
TOLSTOY At home. 
SASHA Yes, Papa. 
Tolstoy nods, pats Sasha's hand. 
TOLSTOY Very beautiful isn't it? 
SASHA Our home? 
TOLSTOY Yes. 
He leans back against the pillow and drifts again. Sasha gets up and goes outside. After a moment, Valentin follows. 
135   EXT. ASTAPOVO. STATION MASTER'S HOUSE. DAY                   135 
Valentin sees her leaning against the wall.   She's in pain. 
SASHA He said to me once..."you're like your mother. You're so full of anger." 
She turns to him. 
SASHA I know it's terrible...but who will protect him? I don't want him to die. 
Valentin touches her face, goes back inside and into 
136   INT. ASTAPOVO. STATION MASTER'S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. DAY. 136 
Where Chertkov has made a makeshift office. He pores through the cables, letters and telegrams that litter the station master's dining table. He holds one up for Valentin. 
CHERTKOV Kind thoughts from George Bernard Shaw. 
Valentin walks to the table. 
VALENTIN You lied to him. 
CHERTKOV Keep your voice down. 
VALENTIN He wants to see her.    You heard him say it. 
CHERTKOV What exactly do you think she will bring him? 
VALENTIN I don´t know, they´ve been married for 48 years. 
CHERTKOV I´ll tell you what she´ll bring...Vanity, fuss and noise. 
VALENTIN She promised me- 
SASHA I can't do this anymore. 
CHERTKOV He won´t know who she is anyway. 
142   INT. ASTAPOVO. TRAIN CARRIAGE. NIGHT.                      142 
Everyone sleeps but Sofya. There is a knock on the door. Sofya opens it. It is Sasha. A pause. 
SOFYA Has he asked for me? 
SASHA I want you to come.    Take a coat. It's cold. 
143   EXT. ASTAPOVO. STATIONMASTER'S HOUSE. NIGHT.               143 
Sofya and Sasha walk to the door. The reporter calls out 
REPORTER Countess...Countess...Do you have any information? Countess...Is he dying? Is he dead? 
Sasha takes her mother's hand. 
144   INT. ASTAPOVO. STATIONMASTER'S HOUSE. NIGHT.               144 
She steps into the room. For a moment, she seems overwhelmed at the sight of him. She looks at Valentin, who nods at her as if to say go on. Sofya walks past Chertkov without acknowledging him. Dushan lets go his hold of Tolstoy's wrist and gets out of the chair, out of her way. She approaches her sleeping, husband, the love of her life, her cross, her everything. 
SOFYA Lyovochka! 
There is no response.    She throws her arms around him. 
SOFYA Please forgive me, my darling! 
SASHA Mother... 
SOFYA I'm a fool.. I'm a selfish woman. But I love you. Please believe me. Please understand me. Please forgive me for all my weakness and badness. Please! Please! Love me! 
SASHA Mother! 
Sasha takes her hand, whispers. 
SASHA Control yourself. 
SOFYA Was I shouting? 
SASHA You have to control yourself. 
Sofya looks around and sits back. Strangely, she does control herself. She becomes very still. She takes her husband's hand, begins quietly to speak to him. 
SOFYA You don't speak, but I hear you. 
She carries on two sides of an impossible conversation. 
SOFYA "Do you love me, Lyovochka." (beat) "Never stopped, my little bird." (beat) "And you will never stop" (beat) "Never." (beat) "Nor ever leave me again." (beat) "Never, ever again. (beat) "Good...good... let's go home" 
She sits very still holding her husband's hand. Then, it seems she feels the slightest of movements, the slightest squeeze of her hand. She looks down to see Tolstoy open his eyes. He looks at her for a moment, the hint of a smile, then closes his eyes again. 
Valentin sees it, glances at Sasha.   Then, he begins to fight for breath. 
DUSHAN First cessation. 
A general sense of panic at the proximity of death. Tolstoy fights for a last breath. 
DUSHAN Second cessation. 
Sofya whispers quietly to her dying husband. 
SOFYA Please forgive me if I cry a little now. 
Tolstoy continues to struggle, then silence, silence. 
Sasha starts to sob. Sofya reaches out to her daughter. Sasha comes to her mother who holds her. 
She feels someone next to her.   She looks up. It's Chertkov. 
CHERTKOV I am sorry, Sofya Andreyevna. 
The most unlikely thing, she pats his hand. 
SOFYA It's alright. What happens from now on... it will never really matter. Not really. Everything's finished.

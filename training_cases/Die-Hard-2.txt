DIE HARD 2 WHILE WE'RE IN BLACK we HEAR a PNEUMATIC "KA-CHUNK" and then 
MCCLANE'S VOICE Holy shit, whoa, whoa - 
FADE IN: 
1 EXT. DULLES TERMINAL - DAY 1 
JOHN MCCLANE, long topcoat FLAPPING, comes running out of the terminal towards an AIRPORT COP in plastic covered uniform who is supervising a TOW TRUCK DRIVER who in turn is manhandling a sedate sedan with Virginia plates and a "GRANDMOTHER ON BOARD" sign on the rear window. 
MCCLANE I'm here, I'm here, false alarm, let's just let her down nice and easy - 
COP Sure. At the impound lot. 
(POINTING) Next time, read the sign. 
MCCLANE You don't understand, I'm just meeting my wife's-plane - you gotta give me this car back. 
COP Sure. Tomorrow 8 to four, you pay 40 bucks, we give it back. 
MCCLANE This is my mother in law's car. She already hates me because I'm not a 
DENTIST - 
(SHOWING-BADGE) See, I'm a cop. LAPD. How about some team spirit? 
COP I was in LA once. Hated it.

MCCLANE (going with the flow) I can relate to that. Hate it myself- (turning to tow guy) Hey, that's a plastic fender, Jesus- (back to cop) See, I used to be a New York cop still got my ID somewhere -I only moved 'cause my wife got promoted - look, maybe we can settle this right here, we're in Washington, heartbeat of Democracy, one hand washes the other He realizes the truck is DRIVING AWAY one way while the cop is i going off the other way - McClane votes for the cop - 
MCCLANE Hey, c'mon, it's Christmas - 
COP So Ask Santa to bring you another car.

MCCLANE 
(SOTTO) You son of a - BEEP drowns out his last word. McClave sweeps aside his coat, finds the beeper on his belt. He looks at the obviously unfamilar number on the read out in puzzlement, then runs into the terminal. 
2 INT. DULLES TERMINAL - DAY 2 
CHRISTMAS MUSIC wafting through the building from a SCHOOL CHOIR perched in front of a massive, three-story window. Blase travelers PAUSE in their hectic rush to applaud the angelic voices. McClane shoves his way through some people - when they GLARE at him he quickly APPLAUDS the kids, pulls up at an INFORMATION BOOTH - the girl there is watching a LITTLE TV on the shelf out of sight from the public. 
MCCLANE 1ST NEWSCASTER Telephones? (on TV) .and that White Christmas INFORMATION GIRL may be here for a while, if (pointing) that new storm front moves Right over there. to the Metro area this afternoon as predicted. McClane nods, serves across the slick linoleum.

2A WITH MCCLANE 2A he fairly SKIDS to a halt at a line of PHONE BOOTHS - and outside each booth a long LINE of people with their armfuls of luggage

EXT. AIRPORT - THROUGH WINDOW - SAME TIME 
I A plane TAKES OFF. We PULL BACK and realize we're in a MOTEL ROOM. The TV is on and we SEE the TV PICTURE CHANGE to a TROPICAL AIRFIELD. Khaki-clad heavily armed SOLDIERS form a cordon as a stiff-backed handsome MAN of 60 in handcuffs and leg chains is hustled aboard a plane. 
HOLLY My husband doesn't think so. 
OLDER WOMAN Well, I do. I used to carry around those awful mace things - She opens her purse and displays a Taser stun gun. OLDER WOMAN(cont'd)

I MCCLANE --do I know you? 
STUART 
R (TIGHTLY) I... get that a lot. I've... been on TV. 
J 
MCCLANE You and me both, pal. The hell with it. Now it's Stuart's turn to look at McClane oddly; then he moves off. McClane looks after him, trying to place him... shrugs... heads for the bar. 
CUT TO: 
17 A LITTLE SEMI-RURAL CHURCH - NEAR THE AIRPORT 17 Charming until the SUB WOOFER ROAR of a big jet SCREAMS by, practically in the little church's backyard. Now we notice that the church is a little run down - trim needing paint, sidewalk cracked - and a neat SIGN confirms our 
SUSPICIONS: 
"FUTURE SITE OF PARISH DAY CARE CENTER. 
WORSHIP WITH US AT OUR NEW CHURCH, 
52 KENSINGTON ROAD, ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA." A DWP VAN pulls up, snow tires CRUNCHING on the driveway here. Two MEN (BAKER and THOMPSON) get out in official DWP wardrobe. But we remember the trim bodies, trimmer hair... and we remember those gift wrapped packages, - which one of these guys carries. 
18 INSIDE THE CHURCH 18 On a TV here, the newscast CONTINUES, now back to the tropical airport. Esperanza is at the top of the steps, waving to the press like a triumphant hero - not a felon en route to prison. The plane doors close and it taxis down the runway. WIDEN from the set, which an elderly CUSTODIAN is watching while he eats some instant soup. The DOORBELL RINGS. The custodian answers it.

Chief earlier this year, We're checking our equipment. the agreement to extradite Any problems with the conduit him was not reached until box in your backyard? yesterday - and Washington insiders say it was a phone CUSTODIAN call that made it happen - Gee, I don't know anything a phone call from an about that. angry American President. Baker and Thompson glance at each other. 
THOMPSON Would you mind if we take a look? 
CUSTODIAN Help yourself. 
18A WIDER 18A The three men walk down the main aisle of the church. Dust motes dance in the colored light. 
CUSTODIAN Don't seem right, somehow, closing a church down. Oh, I know the parish is gonna keep using it, but it won't be the same. Been here a lot of years; and I been right here with it. They've arrived at a rear window. FOCUS CHANGE to a green CONDUIT BOX on the the church's rear lawn, half covered in snow. FOCUS back through the glass. Thompson looks questioningly at Baker, who nods. 
CUSTODIAN Yep. I kinda feel a part of me is dying along with this church. 
BAKER Well, you're right about that. BLAM BLAM GLAM. BULLETS RIP through the end of the Christmas package, SLAM the custodian up and into a row of pews, which 
OVERTURN.

19 NEW ANGLE 19 { Baker rips the rest of the smoking package away from his weapon, s 1i s it over his shoulder and begins to SHOVE the pews aside to make a larger open area. Thompson, meanwhile, takes out a very futuristic transceiver. He turns it ON; getting a RED light; enters a NUMBER CODE on the keypad and gets a GREEN LIGHT. There's an EERIE QUALITY to the transmission. 
THOMPSON This is team one. We're here. 
NEWSCASTER(CONT'D) This is Leonard Adkins, in Val Verde - where the war on drugs has finally taken its first prisoner. With an annoyed expression, Thompson CLICKS OFF the newscast.

McClane's head panning the holiday crowd - then SEEING Cochrane. Quickly, he FOLLOWS Cochrane downwards - into 
37 LUGGAGE AREA 37 where a TOURIST JUNKET gets between McClane and his quarry- 
38 C9CC $ANE 38 a GLIMPSE of him at a door marked "NO ADMITTANCE" - then he's gone. McClane runs up, too late; the door is shut again. He looks around, sees a LUGGAGE WORKER, flashes his badge. 
MCCLANE Open this. (as the guy obeys) Got a cop on duty around here? 
LUGGAGE GUY Airport police - 
MCCLANE 
(SCOWLS; THEN;) Get 'em. 
39 INT. LUGGAGE CONVEYOR AREA - DAY 39 
Dark. Clatters and bumps, machine sounds... more bumps. McClane moves cautiously along. He JUMPS as a large SHADOW moves nearby, but it's a big CASE on a conveyor belt. Now, he stoops to go under another conveyor belt - the different tracks intersect and pass each other like freeway off-ramps discharging luggage from one to another - and then he SEES -

39A COCHRANE AND MILLER 39A 
I One has his jacket off, and just now dusts off his hands like a man finishing a job. The other one has one of those transceivers. 
MCCLANE'S VOICE Excuse me. 
41 NEW ANGLE 41 They turn, see McClane with his badge in his left hand - his right hidden under the long coat which is draped over his shoulder like Clint Eastwood's serape in a Spaghetti Western. 
MCCLANE(CONT'D) This is a restricted area. You boys too impatient to wait for the skycaps? 
MILLER We... work for th amine. 
MCCLAN.E Yeah? Let's see some ID - Instantly both men DIVE to the outside, drawing guns. 
42 THE TRANSCEIVER 42 Falls, skids... somewhere. 
43 BACK TO SCENE 43 Dropping his'wallet, McClane JUMPS aside as SHOTS WHIZZ PAST -McClane's COAT takes the BULLET HITS in MID AIR as he LANDS on a conveyor belt, which CARRIES him UP and OVER the gunmen. They FIRE UP at him - He aims.back - and then a SUITCASE falling from another belt and knocks his gun away! 
44 BELOW 44 The gun CLATTERS on the floor. Seeing it, the two men exchange a glance - split up.

We WIDEN and see Airport police and coroner's people about to make off with it... and the MEDIA, now drooling over this new story dropped right into their laps.

BAKER guards the rear door with an ASSAULT RIFLE. He REACTS, tense as a FIGURE appears, running up from the snowy expanse behind the church. It's 'filer- the man who escaped from McClane. Baker waves him in. KAHN and Bï¿½ are DIGGING in theme y rd with pickaxes and hardly 0o at him. ï¿½

STUART You're late. 
MILLER We ran into trouble; a policeman. He killed Cochrane; I barely got away. 
STUART Did you finish your assignment? 
MILLER Yessir. But -

67 INT. AIRPORT POLICE OFFICE--DAY 67 
McClane comes in, first double taking the name on the door: 
CARMINE LORENZO, CAPTAIN OF AIRPORT POLICE. The man himself - a 20 year veteran of bureaucratic wars that have earned him this little kingdom - rises behind his desk. 
LORENZO 
YOU - (a glance at a FAX) McClane?

CAMERA MOVES from the cockpit back through the rest of the plane. 
CO-PILOT Ay, Alle va nos escorto. 
PILOT Es bueno; el peligro es pasado. Estamos segur hasta los Estados Unidos. Cuanto tiempo? 
CO-PILOT 
(CHECKING WATCH) Tres horas y media. By now we are on Esperanza. Looking astonishingly carefree, (X) he smiles at the young CORPORAL guarding him, puffs on a cigar... (X) and casually examines the military chronometer on his handcuffed (X) wrist. We PUSH IN on it. (X) 
CUT TO: 
73 INT. VIRGINIA CHURCH 73 
WIDEN from Stuart's Huer, showing the exact same time. Now we SEE that the church is full of ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT: In fact, it looks very much like a mini-version of an airport control tower, complete with radar screens and a big glass board to mark positions on.

CONTINUED - 73 CAMERA follows a MAN with a Pizza sized RADAR DISH as he crosses the room, a CRONY unrolling WIRE behind him. CRANE UP as the man CLIMBS into the STEEPLE... UP, UP, UP, until he's in the BELFRY where a PRERIGGED TRIPOD WAITS for the dish. As he CLAMPS it in place we SEE the yard behind the church and the SPARKLE of WELDING TOOLS; someone is making CONNECTIONS to the now open conduit box and underground CABLES.

(AH) This way. The FAX starts to leave McClane - voila, it's already arriving at Powell's office. 
POWELL (as it arrives) Fingerprints? 
MCCLANE From a stiff down here at Dulles. I marked the whorls with a pen in case the transmission's fuzzy. Can you run that through State and Federal for me - throw in Interpol if you got it. 
POWELL 
(WATCHING IT) Will do. What's this about? 
MCCLANE I don't know. Just a feeling. 
POWELL Ouch. You get those feelings insurance companies start to go bankrupt.

(READING BADGE) Lieutenant McClane? 
MCCLANE I think something serious is going to happen here tonight - 
TRUDEAU Hey. Something serious happens every night, only it doesn't make the newspapers. Ever see those guys on TV, juggling knives and cha n i saws? That's what we're doing with those planes up there, only we do it one handed 'cause the other hand's playing 3 card monte with the planes on the ground. 
MCCLANE Anybody try and fix the deck tonight? (on his look) Anything weird going on besides the shooting? 
BARNES We did. lose FAA approach control-

TRUDEAU (after a moment) Lorenzo. Have all your shift Commanders report in... now. 
LORENZO What? You're buying into this - 
TRUDEAU I want them to report anything out of the ordinary --no matter how trivial. You got that? 
LORENZO (annoyed, but obeying) I got it.

TRUDEAU How. did you get on this line? Who is this? 
STUART Who I am is unimportant. What I want... well, if you don't want those planes overhead to start dropping like flies when they run out of fuel... what I want is very important. All REACT - McClane as much as anyone.

STUART(CONT'D) A plane is going to be landing at this Airport in 58 minutes. It is FM 1 - Foreign Military 1. 
MCCLANE Esperanza? Trudeau nods - 
STUART This plane is scheduled to be met by a continigent from the U.S. Justice-department. But now there will be a change of plans. This plane will not be met by anyone. It will land on a runway of my designation where it will not be molested. That will conclude my interest in that plane and your responsibility for it. At the same time, I want a 747 cargo conversion fully fueled. 
95 FAVORING MCCLANE 95 As Trudeau tries to make headway with Stuart, McClave leans over to Barnes. 
MCCLANE What's all that about? 
BARNES A 747 has the furthest flight capacity of anything we've got here. Take out the seats and save some weight, add the wing tanks and it could go to Australia, Africa, Asia - hell the whole Goddamn world.' 
MCCLANE Meaning they pull Esperanza off his plane and take him anywhere there's no extradition treaties. 
LORENZO They're talking to us on our own Goddamn system! They gotta be close - I'll have my men tear this airport

LORENZO (turning, shouting) Security! (back to McClane) You're out of here! And already two big Airport cops are trotting over. As Trudeau REACTS, unsure -

MCCLANE (sotto, to himself) I don't believe this... another fucking elevator... another fucking basement... why does this always happen to me? He moves through the cavernous maze, and then REACTS to MUSIC. Moves towards it. And arrives in - 
103 AN ... APARTMENT 103 Or something like it: Here, in an area reached only my somebody with a groundhog in his ancestry, is a space with some battered chairs, a 3-legged card table, a cot made up with faded but neat covers, some 50's vintage.(but lovingly scotch taped) PIN UPS, and a tiny kitchen precariously propped up on a big purple plumbling valve on the wall. 
104 ON A PHONOGRAPH 104 The SOURCE of.the music, a 78 SPINNING on the old machine. McClane's HAND picks it up and we WIDEN as he looks at it curiously. A HAND reaches for McClane's shoulder. 
105 NEW ANGLE 105 McClane's instincts take over; in a flash, he WHIRLS and his would be attacker is pinned against a wall. It's a wizened MAN in his 60's who now raises his hands to show he ain't looking for trouble. 
MCCLANE Who the fuck are you? In response, the man points to the NAMETAG on his coveralls. 
MAN (MARVIN) Marvin, I'm Marvin. Thought you was tryin' to steal my records, that's all. He moves to them, possessively.

MCCLANE 
(LOOKING AROUND) Yeah. Just like you're not supposed to be living here. 
MARVIN W-who said I was living here? McClane shows his badge. 
MCCLANE Come on, Marvin. I wasn't born yesterday. Carmine Lorenzo know you don't go home after you punch out? 
MARVIN L-Lorenzo? C-come on, officer, I can barely get by, even with my pension. You know, I'm a vet, WW 2? If it wasn't for guys like me, you kids' be eatin' sushi today. I'm just trying to. save a few. bucks -I could. get fired if you tell. McClane moves over to a big panel with telephone lines and jacks. Examines it as he speaks. 
MCCLANE I'm a veteran myself, Marvin. And a married one. You married? 
MARVIN Six times.

(INTO PHONE) I'm sending the SWAT team over for Barnes now - we don't need the Goddamn Christmas tourists seeing guns and flipping out so they'll take him the long way around... 
107 IN BASEMENT - TIGHT ON ALLIGATOR CLIPS 107 We WIDEN as Marvin connects them to one set of bolts, then another. 'McClave shakes his head. No... no...yes! 
LORENZO'S VOICE Through the annex skywalk to the new terminal... that way nobody sees them, we don't have any panic. 
TRUDEAU'S VOICE And we don't want any disasters. Barnes has five minutes to check out that antenna array. 
114B BACK TO SCENE 114B McClane takes a breath, starts across the beam. There's a scary moment at first but he gets quickly confident - a bit too ; 7-7 confident midway - he starts to lose his balance and all-but runs to the far end, JUMPS to safety. As he pulls himself up he HEARS Marvin CLAPPING behind him. With a scowl, McClane checks his map, pushes on.

GARBER You were right... they went for the antenna array. We're right on schedule. 
STUART Except losing our own team wasn't part of the plan. He comes to a decision. Picks up the phone. Speaks. Voice flat, firm, stern. Around and above him, his men hover over the improvised screens and terminals.

STUART McClave? John McClane? The... policeman hero who saved the Nakatomi hostages? I read about you in People magazine. You seemed out of your league on Nightline, though... 
MCCLANE Yeah, Colonel. We were both famous for five minutes. Saw you get shit canned by Congress on TV. How much drug money is Esperanza paying you to turn traitor? 
STUART I think Cardinal Richlieu said it best: Treason is merely a matter of dates. And this country has to learn it can't keep cutting the legs off men. like General Esperanza -men with the guts to stand up to Soviet agression. 
MCCLANE And lesson one starts with killing policemen? What's lesson two - the Neutron bomb? 
STUART I think we can find something in between. (aside, off mike) Give me a flight number - one low on fuel. Another man hands him a slip of paper. He reads it, switches to another mike (or frequency).

STUART Don't worry, Captain. If this goes into extra innings...

SAM --hundreds of people in the terminal heard or saw the crash, but still there has been no official word from authorities. Meanwhile - despite the fact that only one runway has been closed due to the tragedy, several dozen airliners are visible from where I stand, endlessly circling the field.

Now, he puts all his energy into levering the rifle against the steel. Slowly, slowly, sweat breaking out on his forehead, he levers the rifle higher and higher, the rifle in turn levering the grid upward, an inch at a time finally, it's high enough for him to JAM the rifle's bayonet ring into the grid while the cheek notch of the stock perches precariously on the lip of the hole.

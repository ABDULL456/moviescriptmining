Christopher Nolan & David S. Goyer 
BLACK SCREEN. 
GORDON (V.O) Harvey Dent was needed. He was everything Gotham has been crying out for. He was...a hero. Not the hero we deserved - the hero we needed. Nothing less than a knight, shining... 
The sound of cracking. Splintering. A shape appears, in ice. The shape of a BAT. The ice disintegrates... 
EXT. GOTHAM STREET - DAY 
Gordon stands before a massive picture of Harvey Dent. 
GORDON But I knew Harvey Dent. I was...his friend. And it will be a very long time before someone inspires us the way he did. Gordon, choked with emotion, gathers the papers of his eulogy. I believed in Harvey Dent. And we FADE TO BLACK. 
CUT TO: 
Racing along a cratered dirt road, and we are - 
INT. LAND CRUISER JOSTLING OVER UNEVEN TERRAIN - DAY 
Three Hooded Men guarded by East European Militia. A third Militia drives. Next to him is a nervous, bespectacled man. 
EXT. AIRSTRIP, EASTERN EUROPE - DAY 
An airstrip overlooking a grey city rocked by artillery fire. A bland CIA Operative, flanked by Special Forces Men, stands in front of a commuter plane. CIA Man watches the Land Cruiser pull up, hard. The Militia Men jump out of the vehicle. The Driver shoves the bespectacled man in front of the CIA Man. 
CIA MAN Dr. Pavel, I'm CIA. Dr. Pavel nods, nervous. CIA Man hands the Driver a briefcase. 
DRIVER He wasn't alone. CIA Man, confused, spots the Hooded Men. He turns to Dr. Pavel. 
CIA MAN You don't get to bring friends. 
DR. PAVEL 
(SHAKEN) They are not my friends. 
DRIVER Don't worry, no charge for them. 
CIA MAN Why would I want them? 
DRIVER They were trying to grab your prize. (Smiles.) They work for the mercenary. The masked man. 
CIA MAN 
(EXCITED) Bane? The Driver nods. CIA Man turns to his Special Forces Men. 
CIA MAN Get 'em on board - I'll call it in. 
EXT. SKIES OVER MOUNTAIN RANGE - DAY 
The commuter plane struggles over snow-capped mountains. 
INT. MAIN CABIN, COMMUTER PLANE - CONTINUOUS 
The three Hooded Men kneel by the cargo door, handcuffed. CIA Man grabs Hooded Man 1. 
CIA MAN What are you doing in the middle of my operation? 
Hooded Man 1 says nothing. CIA Man pulls out a handgun. The flight plan I just filed with the Agency lists me, my men, and Dr. Pavel here. But only one of you. CIA Man opens the cargo door. Special Forces hang Hooded Man 1 out into the howling wind - CIA Man shouts above the wind. 
CIA MAN 
FIRST ONE TO TALK GETS TO STAY ON MY AIRCRAFT! (Cocks weapon.) 
SO...WHO PAID YOU TO GRAB DR. 
PAVEL?! 
Nothing. CIA Man fires out the open door and the Special Forces yank Hooded Man 1 back in, clubbing him quiet. 
CIA MAN 
HE DIDN'T FLY SO GOOD! WHO WANTS TO 
TRY NEXT?! 
The Soldiers grab Hooded Man 2, hang him out the door. 
CIA MAN 
TELL ME ABOUT BANE! WHY DOES HE 
WEAR THE MASK?! 
The prisoner says nothing. CIA Man presses the gun to the man's hood - he cocks the gun...nothing. 
CIA MAN 
LOT OF LOYALTY FOR A HIRED GUN! 
THIRD PRISONER (O.S.) Or he's wondering why someone would shoot a man before throwing him out of an aeroplane. 
CIA Man turns to the Third Prisoner. Shuts the cargo door. 
CIA MAN Wiseguy, huh? At least you can talk. Who are you? 
THIRD PRISONER We are nothing. We are the dirt beneath your feet. And no one cared who I was until I put on the mask... 
CIA Man, wary, approaches the Third Prisoner - pulls off his hood, revealing a dark mask with a breathing apparatus. The eyes behind it are cold. Still. This is Bane. 
BANE Who we are does not matter. What matters is our plan. 
BLAKE The last confirmed sighting of the Batman. He murders those people, takes out two SWAT teams, breaks Dent's neck...then just vanishes? 
GORDON I'm not hearing a question, son. 
Blake shifts uneasily. Then looks at Gordon. 
BLAKE Don't you want to know who we was? Gordon turns to look at the broken searchlight. He brushes his fingers across its rusted shell. 
GORDON I know exactly who he was. (Turns to Blake.) He was Batman. 
Gordon walks past Blake, heading for the stairs. 
GORDON (O.S.) Let's go see about the Congressman's wife... 
INT. EAST WING, WAYNE MANOR - MORNING 
Alfred takes his tray into the bedroom. The bed is empty. 
ALFRED Master Wayne? Alfred's voice echoes through the vast mansion. No reply. 
INT. STUDY, WAYNE MANOR - MOMENTS LATER 
Alfred hits three notes on the piano. The bookcase opens. 
INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - CONTINUOUS 
Alfred descends into the caverns beneath Wayne Manor. 
INT. BATCAVE - CONTINUOUS 
Alfred walks through the arches as the stone floor starts to lower, becoming a ramp. At the bottom, Alfred is level with a series of dark slate obelisks - a bridge over the water to where Wayne sits at a computer atop a massive slate cube. 
ALFRED You haven't been down here in a long time... 
WAYNE Just trying to find out more about our jewel thief. I ran her prints from the photos she handled - Wayne pulls up a mug shot - a fat, male armed-robbery suspect. - but she was wearing someone else's fingerprints. She's good. 
ALFRED She may be. But we have the trace on the necklace. 
WAYNE We do, so I cross-referenced the address she went back to with police data on high-end B-and-E's... 
Wayne hits a key. A photograph of the Maid appears. Selina Kyle. The databases are full of close calls, tips from fences... 
Newspaper headlines appear - 
THE CAT STRIKES AGAIN, POLICE SUSPECT 'CAT' BURGLAR IN JEWEL 
HEIST. 
WAYNE She's good, but the ground is shrinking beneath her feet. 
ALFRED We should send the police before she fences the pearls. 
WAYNE She won't. She likes them too much. And they weren't what she was after. 
ALFRED What was she after? 
WAYNE My fingerprints. There was printer toner mixed with graphite on the safe. Gives you a good pull, and it's untraceable. 
ALFRED Fascinating. Maybe you should exchange notes over coffee. 
WAYNE Now you're trying to set me up with a jewel thief? 
ALFRED At this point, sir, I would set you up with a chimpanzee if I thought it would bring you back into the world. 
WAYNE There's nothing out there for me. 
ALFRED And that's the problem. You hung up the cape and cowl, but never moved on. You won't get out there and find a life. Find someone - 
WAYNE 
(BITTER) I did find someone, Alfred. 
ALFRED I know. And then you lost them. That's part of living, sir. But you're not living - you're waiting. Hoping for things to go bad again. 
Wayne says nothing. Remember when you left Gotham? Before all this. Before Batman. Seven years you were gone. Seven years I waited. Hoping that you wouldn't come back. Wayne looks at Alfred. Not understanding. Every year I took my holiday. I'd go to Florence. There's a café by the Arno... Any fine evening I would sit there and order a Fernet Branca... INSERT CUT: Alfred seated in a café sipping his drink... I had a fantasy. I liked to imagine that one day I'd look across the tables, and see you. Sitting there with your wife. Perhaps some kids. You wouldn't say anything to me, or me to you, but we'd both know...that you'd made it. That you were happy. 
INSERT CUT: Alfred spots a couple at another table and looks closer, hopeful. But they are strangers. I never wanted you to come back to Gotham. I knew there was nothing there for you but pain and tragedy, and I wanted more for you than that. I still do. Alfred leaves Wayne to his cave. His bats. 
EXT. WATER TREATMENT FACILITY - DAY 
Blake and his partner, Ross, get out of their patrol car. A DWP Man leads them down a long concrete trough. 
DWP MAN They wash up a couple times a month. More when in gets colder - homeless sheltering in the tunnels. We had to pull him to clear the basin, but other than that we didn't touch him... 
They come out by the catchment basin. Above the grille lies a body - a teenage boy. Blake looks down at him. Freezes. 
ROSS What? 
BLAKE Name's Jimmy. He's at St. Swithin's. (Off look.) The boys home where I...I coach some ball. 
EXT. ST. SWITHIN'S HOME FOR BOYS - DAY 
Blake looks up at the shabby building. 
INT. ST. SWITHIN'S HOME FOR BOYS - MOMENTS LATER 
Blake is talking to Father Reilly. 
FATHER REILLY Jimmy hadn't been here for months. 
BLAKE Why? 
FATHER REILLY You know why, Blake - he aged out. We don't have the resources to keep boys on after sixteen - 
BLAKE The Wayne Foundation gives money for that - 
FATHER REILLY Not for two years now. 
BLAKE He has a brother here, right? 
INT. DIVE BAR - CONTINUOUS 
Blake enters, gun drawn. Spots the Congressman. 
BLAKE 
(INTO RADIO) I've got the Congressman - bullet to the leg, but he's okay. 
EXT. ALLEY BEHIND BAR - CONTINUOUS 
The SWATs return fire. The Thugs lay down cover fire, then race around a corner into a smaller passage. A cop car pulls up, blocking the mouth of the alley - Gordon jumps out, gun drawn. 
The SWATs approach the passage, massing on both corners tactically. The two corner SWATs exchange hand signals, counting down... They round the corner, aiming low and high. The passage is empty. 
The SWATs cover a fire escape, but Gordon spots at once - 
GORDON Manhole! 
He races to the manhole cover - SWATs wrench off the cover, Gordon grabs a flashlight from the nearest SWAT. 
GORDON You three, down with me. You two, head down to cover the next exit - 
SWAT Where -? 
GORDON Get the DWP down here, now! 
Gordon starts climbing down the ladder... 
INT. SEWERS - CONTINUOUS 
Gordon moves down the tunnel, flashlight low. Three SWATs fall in behind... 
EXT. ALLEY BEHIND BAR - CONTINUOUS 
Blake comes into the alley. Cops surround the manhole. 
COP Where's the DWP guy? 
BLAKE They went down there? 
FOLEY (shaking his head) And Gordon took SWAT in after them. 
INT. SEWERS - CONTINUOUS 
Gordon hears a noise up ahead - pushes forward, rounds the corner. BANG! GUNFIRE. SWATs return fire, shots sparking off the concrete walls, then - BOOM - behind him the tunnel ERUPTS IN FIRE, blasting the SWATs. Gordon races forward, tearing through the tunnels. 
EXT. ALLEY BEHIND BAR - CONTINUOUS 
Blake jumps back as a fireball bursts out of the manhole. 
INT. SEWERS - CONTINUOUS 
Gordon races around a corner, gun drawn. A noise makes him turn - WHACK, he is clobbered from behind by a Thug. 
EXT. ALLEY BEHIND BAR - CONTINUOUS 
Blake pushes forward. 
BLAKE Come on, we gotta get down there - 
COP That was a gas explosion, kid - 
BLAKE Gas? This is a sewer! 
FOLEY No one goes in there till we know what's down there. 
BLAKE We know what's down there, sir. The Police Commissioner! 
FOLEY Somebody get the hothead out of here. And get me a DWP guy! Blake backs off. Gets an idea - goes for his patrol car. 
INT. SEWERS - CONTINUOUS 
Thug 1 flips Gordon onto his back. 
THUG 1 This one's alive. (Looks closer.) Jesus. It's the Police Commissioner. 
THUG 2 What do we do? 
THUG 1 Take him to Bane. The two Thugs drag Gordon down through the maze of tunnels. As they descend deeper they encounter work crews of muscular men wielding large drills and jackhammers, working the walls and ceiling of the larger tunnels. Some of the men are armed Mercenaries, overseeing gangs of homeless street kids. They stare as Gordon is dragged past. The Thugs drag Gordon between two waterfalls, into - 
INT. BANE'S LAIR, SEWERS - CONTINUOUS (NIGHT) 
They approach a figure, turned away, crouched in the firelight. Bare-chested, muscular, masked. Bane. A crooked line of scar tissue runs the length of his spine... 
BANE Why are you here? The Thugs drop Gordon at Bane's feet. 
THUG 1 Answer him! Bane slowly turns to the Thugs. 
BANE I'm asking you. 
THUG 1 It's the Police Commissioner. 
BANE And you brought him down here? 
THUG 2 We didn't know what to do. We - 
BANE You panicked. And your weakness costs three lives. 
THUG 1 No, he's alone - Bane flips the Thug's chin up and to the side with a crack. Thug 1 drops. Bane turns to Thug 2. 
BANE Search him. Then I will kill you. The Thug, terrified, pulls out Gordon's badge, wallet, gun...and the folded papers of the speech he did not read. Bane takes these one by one with quick glances. He stops at the papers. Unfolds them... 
As he reads, Gordon rolls off the steps, dropping into the rushing flow of water - gunshots ring out... 
THUG 2 He's dead. 
Thug 2 trails off as Bane looks up from the papers... 
BANE Then show me his body. 
MIRANDA He doesn't talk to you either? 
FOX Let's just say that Bruce Wayne has his...eccentricities. 
MIRANDA 
(RISING) Mr. Fox, are you aware that John Daggett is trying to acquire shares in Wayne Enterprises? 
FOX I was not. But it wouldn't do him any good - Mr. Wayne still retains a clear majority. Miranda leaves. Fox moves into his office - stops. 
FOX Bruce Wayne. As I live and breathe. Wayne rises, pushing hard on his cane. 
FOX What brings you out of cryo-sleep Mr. Wayne? 
WAYNE I see you haven't lost your sense of humor...even if you have lost most of my money. 
FOX Actually, you did that yourself. See, if you funnel the entire R and D budget for five years into a fusion project that you then mothball, your company is unlikely to thrive. 
WAYNE Even with - 
FOX A wildly sophisticated CEO, yes. Wayne Enterprises is running out of time. And Daggett is moving in. 
WAYNE What're my options? 
FOX If you're not willing to turn your machine on - 
WAYNE I can't, Lucius. 
FOX Then sit tight. Your majority keeps Daggett at arm's length while we figure out a future for the energy program with Miranda Tate - she's supported your project all the way. She's smart, and quite lovely. 
WAYNE You too, Lucius? 
FOX We all just want what's best for you, Bruce. Show her the machine. 
WAYNE I'll think it over. 
FOX Anything else? 
WAYNE No, why? 
FOX These conversations always used to end with some...unusual requests. 
WAYNE I retired. 
FOX Let me show you some stuff, anyway. Fox hits a button - the bookcase opens into a hidden elevator. 
INT. APPLIED SCIENCES - MOMENTS LATER 
Fox leads Wayne into the vast, gadget-filled space. They pass Tumblers with different weapons configurations... 
WAYNE I figured you'd have shut this place down. 
FOX It was always shut down, officially. 
WAYNE But all this new stuff? 
FOX After your father died, Wayne Enterprises set up fourteen different defense subsidiaries. I've spent years shuttering them and consolidating all the prototypes under one roof. My roof. 
WAYNE Why? 
FOX Stop them falling into the wrong hands. Besides, I thought someone might get some use out of them... Wayne shakes his head. 
FOX Sure I can't tempt you to something? Pneumatic crampons? Infrared lenses? Least let me get you something for that leg. 
WAYNE It's fine the use it gets these days. 
FOX Well, then I have just the thing for an eccentric billionaire who doesn't like to walk... Fox opens a door - we glimpse a sleek vehicle. Wayne's eyes light up. 
WAYNE Now you're just showing off. 
FOX Defense Department project for tight-geometry urban pacification. Rotors configured for maneuvering between buildings without recirculation. 
WAYNE What's it called? 
FOX It has a long and uninteresting Wayne Enterprises designation. So I took to calling it the Bat. And yes, Mr. Wayne, it does come in black. Wayne touches its sleek side. Marveling. 
FOX Works great except for the autopilot. 
WAYNE What's wrong with that? 
FOX Software-based instability. Take a better mind than mine to fix it. 
WAYNE Better mind? 
FOX I was trying to be modest. A less busy mind. Yours, perhaps. Wayne looks wistfully at the machine. Turns away. 
WAYNE I told you. I retired, Lucius. 
INT. EXAMINATION ROOM, GOTHAM GENERAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT 
Wayne listens, distracted, while a Doctor examines an X-ray. 
DOCTOR I've seen worse cartilage in knees 
WAYNE That's good - 
DOCTOR No, that's because there is no cartilage in your knee. And not much of any use in your elbows and shoulders. Between that and the scar tissue on your kidneys, residual concussive damage to your brain tissue and general scarred-over quality of your body... (Takes a deep breath.) I cannot recommend that you go heli-skiing. About the only part of your body that looks healthy is your liver, so if you're bored I recommend you take up drinking, Mr. Wayne. Wayne smiles. The Doctor leaves. Wayne pulls on a ski mask, steps to the window, hops up, pulls a wire from his cane, which he clips to his belt. He props his cane behind the frame - jumps out. The wire unspools from the cane as - 
EXT. TENTH FLOOR, GOTHAM GENERAL HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS 
Wayne drops three floors... 
INT. PRIVATE ROOM, GOTHAM GENERAL - CONTINUOUS 
Gordon lies in his bed, hooked up to machines. Wayne, in ski mask, stands over him. Gordon's eyes flutter open. He tries to speak with a weak, hoarse voice... 
GORDON We were in this together. Then you were gone... 
WAYNE The Batman wasn't needed anymore. We won. 
WAYNE Well, Selina Kyle, I know you came here from your walk-up in Old Town - modest place for a master jewel thief. Which means either you're saving for your retirement - or you're in deep with the wrong people. 
SELINA You don't get to judge me because you were born in the master bedroom of Wayne Manor. 
WAYNE Actually, I was born in the Regency Room. 
SELINA I started off doing what I had to. Once you've done what you had to they'll never let you do what you want to. 
WAYNE Start fresh. 
SELINA There's no fresh start in today's world. Any twelve-year-old with a cell phone could find out what you did. Everything we do is collated and quantified. Everything sticks. We are the sum of our mistakes. 
WAYNE Or our achievements. 
SELINA The mistakes stick better. Trust me. 
WAYNE You think that justifies stealing? 
SELINA I take what I need to from those who have more than enough. I don't stand on the shoulders of people with less. 
WAYNE Robin Hood? 
SELINA I'd do more to help someone than most of the people in this room. Than you. 
WAYNE Maybe you're assuming too much. 
SELINA Or maybe you're being unrealistic about what's really in your pants other than your wallet. 
WAYNE Ouch. 
SELINA You think all this can last? Wayne glances around at the sumptuous party. 
SELINA There's a storm coming, Mr. Wayne. You and your friends better batten down the hatches, because when it hits you're all gonna wonder how you ever thought you could live so large and leave so little to the rest of us. 
WAYNE Sounds like you're looking forward to it. 
SELINA I'm adaptable. 
WAYNE These pearls do look better on you then they did in my safe... 
Wayne rolls her into his shoulder - reaches up to the back of her neck, unclasps the necklace. But I still can't let you keep them. 
The pearls slide off her neck into his other hand. Selina looks at him. Angry. Then kisses him, hard, and disappears into the crowd. Wayne's cane reappears. 
RICH TWIT 
(ANNOYED) You scared her off. 
WAYNE Not likely. 
EXT. MUSEUM - MOMENTS LATER 
Wayne approaches the Valet. Pats down his pockets. 
WAYNE I must have lost my ticket - 
VALET Your wife said you were taking a cab home, sir. 
WAYNE My wife? 
INT./EXT. LAMBORGHINI RACING DOWN STREETS - CONTINUOUS 
Selina permits herself a little smile as she guns the engine. 
INT. ROLLS ROYCE - LATER 
Alfred watches in the mirror as Wayne climbs into the back. 
ALFRED Just you, sir? 
Wayne gives him a withering glare. 
(MORE) 
ALFRED (CONT'D) Don't worry, Master Wayne. Takes a little time to get back into the swing of things. Wayne dials his phone. 
FOX (O.S.) This is Fox. 
WAYNE Remember those 'unusual requests' I used to make? 
FOX (O.S.) I knew it! Up front, Alfred listens. Concerned. 
INT. BATCAVE - DAY 
Wayne pushes a button on a hi-tech carbon fiber brace strapped to his good knee - the brace tones. As Wayne starts moving his knee, bending, stretching, Alfred puts down a Thermos. 
ALFRED You've got the wrong leg, sir. 
WAYNE You start with the good limb so it learns your optimum muscle patterns. Wayne swaps the brace to his bad knee. Puts his weight on it - the knee bends, kicks. He sits again. Cautious. Now we tighten it up. 
Wayne gingerly pushes a button - the brace starts to shrink tight to his leg, digging in. Wayne grits his teeth. 
ALFRED It is terribly painful? 
WAYNE 
(GRITTED TEETH) You're welcome to try it, Alfred. 
ALFRED Happy watching, thank you, sir. Wayne shouts as the brace clicks home. He gets to his feet. 
WAYNE Not bad - Wayne executes a perfect roundhouse, knocking out a brick. Not bad at all. 
Alfred picks up the brick. Considers it. Uneasy. He follows Wayne across the bridge to the cube. 
ALFRED Master Wayne, if you're considering going back out there you need to hear some rumors surrounding Bane. 
WAYNE I'm all ears. 
ALFRED There is a prison. In a more ancient part of the world. A pit. Where men are thrown to suffer and die. But sometimes, a man rises from the darkness. Sometimes...the pit sends something back. 
BANE For now. How much longer does the program need? 
SHOESHINE MAN Eight minutes. 
BANE Time to go mobile. Shoeshine Man picks up the laptop, slips it into his pack... 
EXT. STOCK EXCHANGE - CONTINUOUS 
Allen shouts at his men. 
ALLEN Get the barriers up - no more in and out on this street! Steel wedge-shaped barriers rise up at the mouth of the street. A Sniper watches the doors through a thermal scope. Six large heat signatures bloom, too big for people... 
SNIPER I've got something - The door explodes. SWATs duck, six sportbikes race out and leap the ramp-like barricades, sending SWATs scattering. Cops scramble to pull their vehicles out to give chase. 
EXT. GOTHAM STREET - CONTINUOUS 
The bikes weave through traffic, Traders strapped to the back, facing backwards - screaming, ties flying in the wind. A cruiser falls in behind. 
ROOKIE COP Shoot the tires! 
A Veteran Cop sights a shot, but the Traders are in the way. 
VETERAN COP No shot! 
EXT. STOCK EXCHANGE - CONTINUOUS 
Foley is barking into his radio. 
FOLEY Back off, back off! They've got hostages! 
INT./EXT. CRUISER ON GOTHAM STREETS - CONTINUOUS 
The cruiser follows the bike into a large tunnel. A Rookie Cop looks up into his rear-view. 
ROOKIE COP What's going on with the lights? The Veteran Cop looks back - streetlights and headlights are dying one after another. The darkness is chasing them - the darkness hits them. Their lights, sirens, and engine die... 
And, out of the silence, a dark shape roars past - 
VETERAN COP It can't be... 
ROOKIE COP The hell was that?! 
VETERAN COP Oh boy. You're in for a show tonight, son. 
EXT. HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS 
Food Guy drives the rear bike. He looks back - sees streetlights explode behind him - darkness catching him up. 
The engine chokes and dies. The Trader jumps off, shouting for the cops. Food Guy turns, pulling his gun. SMASH! - Food Guy is thrown backwards off his bike by a dark wing as BATMAN races by on the Bat-Pod. 
EXT. STOCK EXCHANGE - CONTINUOUS 
Foley rushes to Blake's cruiser. 
FOLEY Let's roll, they've spotted the Batman! 
EXT. HIGHWAY INTERSECTION - CONTINUOUS 
The remaining bikes split up as they reach a high overpass. 
EXT. HIGH OVERPASS - CONTINUOUS 
Batman pulls up, overlooking the intersection - pulls a rifle-shaped device. A tone builds - he aims it at the bike and fires. 
EXT. HIGHWAY OFF-RAMP - CONTINUOUS 
Janitor's bike sparks and dies. Sirens as Cops move in, Another bike splutters and dies - the Hostage breaks for cover. 
EXT. HIGH OVERPASS - CONTINUOUS 
Batman sees the last two bikes disappear beneath an overpass. He holsters his EMP rifle and guns the Bat-Pod. 
INT. BLAKE'S CRUISER - CONTINUOUS 
Foley, in the back, is using the cruiser as a mobile command station. 
FOLEY 
(INTO RADIO) Call everyone in - every car patrol, beat cop, off-duty, too! Pull 'em in, close every street! Now! Foley looks out at Gotham rushing by. 
FOLEY I'm gonna do what Gordon never could. 
BLAKE What's that? 
FOLEY I'm gonna take down the Batman. 
BLAKE Sir, what about the armed robbers? 
Foley ignores him. 
EXT. GOTHAM - CONTINUOUS 
All around the city, cops mobilize - cars, vans, choppers... 
EXT. HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS 
Bane pulls up at speed alongside Shoeshine Man. Shoeshine Man glances inside his pack - signals '2'. Bane turns, sees darkness approaching, reaches back and grabs his Hostage, lifting him onto the back of Shoeshine Man's bike. Bane peels off - Batman stays on Shoeshine Man. 
INT. CHOPPER - CONTINUOUS 
A Spotter watches Bane peel off, hits the radio. 
SPOTTER 
(INTO RADIO) One bike's pulled off, no hostage - 
INT. BLAKE'S CRUISER - CONTINUOUS 
Foley listens to the radio, hungry - 
Daggett watches the TV coverage, concerned. Stryver enters. 
STRYVER Bane says the Batman interfered, but the task was accomplished. 
DAGGETT What about the men they arrested? 
STRYVER He says, and I quote, they would die before talking. 
DAGGETT 
(GRINS) Where does he find these guys? Daggett gets to his feet, relieved, moves to his inner office. Open the champagne... 
INT. INNER OFFICE, DAGGETT'S PENTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
Daggett comes through the door, calling back. 
DAGGETT And can we get some girls in here? 
CATWOMAN (O.S.) Careful what you wish for. Catwoman grabs him, throws him across the room. His back slams against the wall - he draws a gun, but - WHACK! - Catwoman pins his wrist to the wall at shoulder height using the high heel of her boot. He whimpers as she leans in. 
CATWOMAN Cat got your tongue? She plucks the gun from his trembling hand. 
DAGGETT You dumb bitch. 
CATWOMAN Nobody ever accused me of being dumb. 
DAGGETT Dumb to show up here tonight. 
CATWOMAN I want what you owe me - 
Click - Stryver has a gun to her head. 
DAGGETT 'I want' never gets... 
Stryver looks appreciatively at Catwoman as she lowers her leg... 
STRYVER Nice outfit...those heels make it tough to walk? 
Catwoman digs her stiletto into his calf, hard. He screams. 
CATWOMAN I don't know, do they? 
Catwoman spins, disarms Stryver, grabs Daggett. 
CATWOMAN So where is it? 
DAGGETT Where's what? 
CATWOMAN The program. The 'Clean Slate'. 
DAGGETT Oh, yeah - the ultimate tool for a master thief with a record. I don't have it. The Bodyguard bursts in, gun drawn. Catwoman, holding Daggett, spins, kicking the window with the point of her heel. The glass shatters. She pulls Daggett through the window. He screams - they drop... 
EXT. WINDOW-CLEANING PLATFORM - CONTINUOUS 
...ten feet onto the window-cleaning platform. Catwoman uses her bladed heel to cut a rope - the platform plunges down the side of the building. 
EXT. FLAT ROOF - MOMENTS LATER 
Catwoman dumps Daggett onto the roof, towering over him. 
CATWOMAN Where is it? 
DAGGETT The 'Clean Slate'? Type in a name and date of birth and within a couple hours that person ceases to exist in any database? Little too good to be true. 
CATWOMAN You're lying. Rykin Data took it to prototype stage - 
DAGGETT That's why I bought them. But they had nothing. It was a gangland myth. 
Catwoman leans back from Daggett, taking this in... Shapes drop onto the rooftop. Emerge from fire exits. They're not Daggett's bodyguards, these are Bane's men... Catwoman holds Daggett by the throat, threatening him. 
CATWOMAN Stay back! They continue to approach. One of them screws a silencer onto his gun. 
CATWOMAN I'm not bluffing! 
VOICE (O.S.) They know... 
All eyes search for the source of the voice. Catwoman spots it - a dark shape, crouched on the roof above: Batman. 
BATMAN They just don't care. 
As the Mercenary with the silencer looks up, Catwoman leaps forward, grabs his gun. Batman drops into the middle of the fray, fighting back Mercenaries at Catwoman's back - she fires at one, clipping him, he drops. She spins aiming at another's head - Batman yanks her arm down, forcing her to miss the Mercenary. Batman takes him out with a kick. 
CATWOMAN You've got to be kidding. 
BATMAN No guns. No killing. 
CATWOMAN Where's the fun in that? As more mercenaries come out onto the roof, Batman runs for the far edge. 
BATMAN Come on! Catwoman follows, confused, as Batman leaps off the roof. She gets to the edge, pauses to look down into the alley - sees the black angular roof of the Bat, cockpit open. Shots impact around her - she leaps, landing hard, but gracefully on the back of the vehicle, slides into the cockpit. As the engines thunder into life, and the canopy hisses shut, taking bullets from above. 
CATWOMAN My mother warned me about getting into cars with strange men - 
BATMAN This isn't a car. Catwoman flinches as the Bat thunders into the sky, downdraft forcing the Mercenaries down onto the roof, all but one, who walks slowly across the roof, strong against the wind...Bane. He watches the Bat roar off into the night. 
EXT. ROOFTOP, SKYSCRAPER, GOTHAM - MOMENTS LATER 
The Bat lands - the canopy opens. Catwoman jumps out. 
CATWOMAN See you around - Batman steps down after her. 
BATMAN You're welcome. 
CATWOMAN I had it under control. 
BATMAN Those weren't street thugs - they were trained killers. I saved your life. In return I need to know what you did with Bruce Wayne's fingerprints. Catwoman looks at him. Considering. 
CATWOMAN Wayne wasn't kidding about a 'powerful friend'. I sold his prints to Daggett. For something that doesn't even exist. 
BATMAN I doubt many people get the better of you. 
WAYNE Sorry?! You expect to destroy my world, then shake hands?! 
ALFRED No. I know what this means - 
WAYNE What does it mean, Alfred?! 
ALFRED It means your hatred. It means losing the person I've cared for ever since I heard his first cries echo through this house. But it might also mean saving your life. And that is more important. 
Wayne looks at Alfred. Furious. Summons the worst thing to say and says it quietly and calmly. 
WAYNE Goodbye, Alfred. 
ALFRED 
(QUIET) Goodbye, Bruce. Wayne mounts the stairs...Alfred watches him go. Turns. 
INT. MASTER BEDROOM, WAYNE MANOR - MORNING 
Wayne is woken by the doorbell. 
INT. STAIRCASE, WAYNE MANOR - MOMENTS LATER 
As Wayne moves through the empty house, tying his dressing gown, he can't resist one tentative. 
WAYNE Alfred? But Alfred is gone. 
INT. FRONT HALL, WAYNE MANOR - CONTINUOUS 
Wayne opens the front door the find Fox. Fox is surprised. 
FOX Answering your own door? 
WAYNE Yes. Could you decode the trades on that drive? 
Fox hands Wayne a newspaper - the main headline: 
BATMAN BACK TO FOIL OR MASTERMIND STOCK RAID... 
FOX I didn't need to. Page three. Wayne turns the page: 
WAYNE DOUBLES DOWN - AND LOSES... 
FOX It seems you made a series of large put options on the futures exchange. Verified by thumb print. The options expired at midnight last night. Wayne looks up from the newspaper, reeling. 
FOX Long term we may be able to prove fraud, but for now...you're completely broke. And Wayne Enterprises is about to fall into the hands of John Daggett. 
WAYNE The weapons - we can't let Daggett get his hands on Applied Sciences - 
FOX Applied Sciences is shut up tight, and off the books. The energy project is a different story. 
WAYNE Miranda Tate. We need to convince the board to get behind her. Let's show her the reactor - 
FOX We're meeting her there in thirty-five minutes. You better get dressed. 
EXT. WAYNE ENTERPRISES RECYCLING PLANT - DAY 
A scrapyard on the Gotham river. Across the water, the towers of Gotham. Lucius leads Miranda from her car. 
MIRANDA You brought me out here to show me a rubbish dump, Mr. Fox? 
FOX Bear with me, Miss Tate. They arrive at a Portakabin and enter. 
INT. PORTAKABIN - CONTINUOUS 
Miranda looks around the derelict office. Fox smiles at her. 
FOX Keep your hands and feet inside the car at all times. He hits a button and the floor descends, Miranda is shocked as the office becomes an elevator into - 
INT. ELEVATOR, FUSION REACTOR - CONTINUOUS 
They descend diagonally into a massive concrete tunnel... 
MIRANDA This is it, isn't it? 
FOX The reactor is beneath the river so that it could be instantly flooded in an event of a security breach. 
MIRANDA Is Bruce Wayne really that paranoid? 
FOX I'm gonna plead the fifth on that one. Miranda marvels as they step off the elevator. She spots a figure deep within: Bruce Wayne. 
WAYNE I thought you might like to see what your investment built. 
MIRANDA No radiation, no fossil fuels. Free, clean energy for an entire city. 
WAYNE If it worked. It doesn't. Wayne leads Miranda to the core. Two perpendicular rings of electromagnets suspend a bowling-ball-sized mass of metal. Wayne hits buttons - the ball glows, then dies to cold. 
WAYNE Ignition, yes. But no chain reaction. 
MIRANDA You've built a lot of security around a damp squib. Nothing. About three years ago a Russian scientist published a paper on weaponized fusion reactions. One week later your reactor started developing problems... (Looks at Wayne.) I think this machine works. 
WAYNE Miranda, if it were operational, the danger to Gotham would be too great. 
MIRANDA Would it make you feel better to know that the Russian scientist died in a plane crash six months ago? 
WAYNE Someone else will work out what Dr. Pavel did. Someone else will figure out how to turn this power source into a nuclear weapon. I need you to take control of Wayne Enterprises and this reactor. 
MIRANDA And to do what with it? 
WAYNE Nothing. Until we can find a way to guarantee its safety. 
MIRANDA And if we can't? 
WAYNE Decommission it. Flood it. 
MIRANDA Destroy the world's best chance for a sustainable future? 
WAYNE If the world's not ready. Yes. 
MIRANDA Bruce, if you want to save the world you have to start trusting it. 
BLAKE It was damn good to see him back. 
WAYNE Not everybody agrees. 
BLAKE They'll figure it out in the end. 
WAYNE Got anything on Bane's whereabouts? 
BLAKE Yeah, I've got five hundred pages of tunnel records and a flashlight. I could use some help. 
WAYNE 
(THINKS) You know what? Drop me in Old Town... 
EXT. SELINA'S BUILDING, OLD TOWN, GOTHAM - DAY 
Blake drops Wayne off. 
WAYNE Don't wait. I'll get a cab. 
BLAKE You got money? 
WAYNE (smiles, sheepish) Actually, no. Blake hands him some bills, watches him cross the street. The radio squawks. Blake reacts - drives off. 
INT. SELINA'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER 
Selina is packing a bag. She hears voices in the stairwell. 
JEN (O.S.) I told you, money first. 
WAYNE (O.S.) I don't think so. 
INT. STAIRWELL OUTSIDE SELINA'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 
Selina finds Wayne standing there with Jen. 
SELINA He's not a mark. Jen looks at Selina. At Wayne. 
SELINA And he doesn't have a cent to his name, anyway. 
INT. SELINA'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER 
Wayne looks at the cramped space. Selina shifts, embarrassed. 
SELINA Yeah, it's not much. (Smiles.) But it's more that you've got right now. 
WAYNE Actually, they're letting me keep the house. 
SELINA 
(SHAKES HEAD) The rich don't even go broke same as the rest of us, huh? 
WAYNE (spots her bag) Vacation? 
SELINA Let's just say that I've incurred the wrath of some people less susceptible to my charms than you. 
WAYNE My powerful friend hopes to change your mind about leaving. 
SELINA And how would he do that? 
WAYNE By giving you what you want. 
SELINA It doesn't exist. 
WAYNE He says it does. He wants to meet. Tonight. 
SELINA Why? 
WAYNE He needs to find Bane. He thinks you'd know how. 
SELINA Tell him I'll think about it. Wayne nods, starts to leave. 
SELINA Mr. Wayne? I'm sorry they took all your money. 
WAYNE No, you're not. 
INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY 
Blake moves through the hospital corridor, looking for - 
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Blake enters. Gordon is sitting up in bed, talking to Foley. 
FOLEY Can we help you, officer? 
BLAKE John Daggett's body was found in a dumpster an hour ago. I thought you might like to know. 
GORDON Why? 
BLAKE Because Daggett's name is all over the permits I pulled to map the tunnels under Gotham. Blake hands Gordon a stack of files. Foley glares at Blake. 
BLAKE MTA maintenance, sewer construction... 
GORDON 
(TO FOLEY) Where did you get to with the tunnel searches? 
FOLEY 
(TO BLAKE) Remind me to tell the detail to keep hotheads out. (To Gordon.) We've had teams down there, but it's a huge network - 
GORDON Get more men, work a grid. I want him found. 
FOLEY Yeah, yeah - the masked man. We're on it. 
Gordon eyes the files hungrily - glances up at Blake. 
GORDON This is good work. Lose the uniform - you're working for me now. We could use some hotter heads around here. 
INT. SEWER TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS 
A Mercenary patrols. Catwoman comes up behind. 
CATWOMAN He's behind you. 
MERCENARY 
(SPINS) Who? Batman hangs upside down behind him. 
BATMAN (O.S.) Me. Darkness smashes onto the Mercenary. Gunfire in the tunnel. Catwoman races along, pursued by a Mercenary. He is yanked off his feet by darkness - he screams... Batman picks off more and more Mercenaries. Screams echo... Batman follows Catwoman through the dark tunnel. 
CATWOMAN Just a little further. A grate slams down, separating them - the lights come on. He is deep inside. 
INT. BANE'S LAIR, SEWERS - CONTINUOUS 
Mercenaries look down on him from above. Catwoman turns. 
CATWOMAN I had to find a way to stop them trying to kill me. 
BATMAN You've made a serious mistake. 
BANE (O.S.) Not as serious as yours, I fear. Batman turns. Bane emerges from behind the waterfalls. 
BATMAN Bane. 
BANE Let's not stand on ceremony here, Mr. Wayne. 
Catwoman hears the name. Less sure of what she's done. Batman moves at Bane - strikes powerful blows - Bane catches his fist. 
BANE Peace has cost you strength. Victory has defeated you. 
Bane SMASHES Batman back - kicks him off the catwalk - Batman drops, uses his cape to land. Bane climbs down on a chain - his men watch in disciplined silence - Batman hurls flashbangs at Bane, who doesn't flinch. 
BANE Theatricality and deception are powerful agents...to the uninitiated. Batman lashes out at Bane - Bane counters - they separate. 
BANE But we are initiated, aren't we, Bruce? The League of Shadows. And you betrayed us... 
BATMAN Us? You were excommunicated. From a gang of psychopaths. 
BANE Now I am the League of Shadows, here to fulfill R¯'s al Gh¯l's 
A U destiny... Batman hurls himself at Bane, throwing him into the waterfall, where he smashes his fists and gauntlets into Bane's mask again and again, water cascading over them. 
Bane is not moving. Just taking the blows. Batman pauses. Bane's arms SHOOT OUT, SMASHING Batman aside - Bane RISES... 
BANE You fight like a younger man. Nothing held back. No reserves. Admirable. But mistaken. Batman hits a switch on his belt - the lights go out - Bane turns slowly addressing all the shadows at once. 
BANE You think darkness is your ally. But you merely adopted the dark. I was born in it. Formed by it... 
In the shadows, Batman circles, looking to strike... 
BANE I didn't see the light until I was already a man. And by then it was nothing to me but blinding... 
Bane lunges backwards into the darkness - Batman's throat in his grasp. 
BANE The shadows betray you, because they belong to me... 
Bane SMASHES him into the ground, POUNDING, pounding, pounding the hard cowl with his bare fists until it CRACKS. Bane RISES from Batman, gestures to the ceiling of the chamber - explosive charges have been drilled into holes... 
BANE I will show you where I've made my home while preparing to bring justice. Then...I will break you. 
A Mercenary tosses Bane a detonator - Batman watches through cracked cowl - Bane hits the detonator - explosions BURST over his head as the ceiling CRUMBLES revealing: Applied Sciences - Bane has dropped the bottom out of Fox's weapons store...a camouflage Tumbler rests in the rubble. 
BATMAN No... 
BANE Your precious armory. Gratefully accepted. We will need it. 
INT. APPLIED SCIENCES - CONTINUOUS 
Mercenaries race through the stacks of equipment... 
INT. BANE'S LAIR, SEWERS - CONTINUOUS 
Batman climbs to his feet, swaying. Bane approaches. 
BANE I wondered which would break first - your spirit... 
Batman SWINGS at him - misses - Bane GRABS him, lifts him 
HIGH. ...or your body. Bane brings Batman down onto his knee, BREAKING his back with a horrific CRACK. 
In the shadows, Catwoman looks on. Shocked. Bane crouches to pull the broken cowl off the broken Wayne. Mercenaries lift Wayne's body and carry him off... Bane stares into the hollow eyes of his trophy... 
Catwoman slinks back into the shadows, and we - 
FADE TO BLACK.

INT. BLAKE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 
This gets Blake's attention. Gordon watches, uneasy... 
EXT. BLACKGATE PRISON - CONTINUOUS 
Bane unfolds the pages of Gordon's undelivered speech... 
BANE 'The truth about Harvey Dent is simple in only one regard - it has been hidden for too long. After his devastating injuries, Harvey's mind has recovered no better than his mutilated face. He was a broken, dangerous man, not the crusader for justice that I, James Gordon, have portrayed him to be for the last eight years. Harvey's rage was indiscriminate. Psychopathic. He held my family at gunpoint, then fell to his death in the struggle over my son's life. The Batman did not murder Harvey Dent - he saved 
(MORE) 
BANE (CONT'D) my boy. Then took the blame for Harvey's appalling crimes, so that I could, to my shame, build a lie around this fallen idol.'

BANE 'The things we did in Harvey's name brought desperately needed security to our streets... But I can no longer live with my lie. It is time to trust the people of Gotham with the truth, and it is time for me to resign.' 
Bane folds the papers. Looks out to the stunned crowd. Do you accept this man's resignation? 
Individuals in the crows start shouting 'Yes!' 
INT. CELLBLOCK, BLACKGATE PRISON - CONTINUOUS 
Prisoners cheer, pounding against the bars. Selina watches... 
EXT. BLACKGATE PRISON - CONTINUOUS 
BANE Do you accept the resignation of all the liars?! All the corrupt?! More and more of the crowd is chanting 'Yes!' 
INT. BLAKE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 
Blake turns to Gordon, who stares at the TV. 
BLAKE These men, locked up in Blackgate for eight years, denied parole under the Dent Act. Based on a lie. 
GORDON A lie to keep a city from burning to the ground. Gotham needed a hero, someone to believe in - 
BLAKE Not as much as it does now. But you betrayed everything you stood for. 
GORDON (looks at Blake) There's a point. Far out there. When the structures fail you. When the rules aren't weapons anymore, they're shackles, letting the bad get ahead. Maybe one day you'll have such a moment of crisis. And in that moment, I hope you have a friend like I did. To plunge their hands into the filth so you can keep yours clean. 
BLAKE Your hands look pretty filthy to me, Commissioner. 
Gordon stares at him. Blake goes back to packing. 
EXT. BLACKGATE PRISON - CONTINUOUS

Blake nods. Leaves.

INT. STONE CELL, UNDERGROUND PRISON - DAY 
Wayne moves to the wall - takes the rope from the Tattooed Prisoner, wraps it around his chest. Curious Prisoners gather, the Prisoner at their head. Wayne looks up at the light, hundreds of feet above. Starts to climb. Prisoners get excited as Wayne RISES - money starts exchanging hands. Reaching the precipice, he checks his rope, looks up at the next handhold, far away. He takes a breath, then LEAPS. His fingers brush the ledge. Wayne DROPS a hundred feet - the rope catches, SLAMMING him into the rock face. The Prisoners disperse, losing interest as the Tattooed Prisoner lowers Wayne on the rope. The Blind Prisoner turns away. 
PRISONER I told you it could not be done. 
WAYNE You told me a child did it... 
PRISONER No ordinary child... INSERT CUT: the Protector fights off prisoners as the Child, older now, moves to the climbing wall A child born in hell. INSERT CUT: the Child makes the climb...pauses, looking down - making eye-contact with the Protector, who fights off Prisoners... They swarm over the Protector, knives drawn. A child forged by suffering, hardened by pain... INSERT CUT: the Child leaps across the abyss, grabbing a handhold on the ledge and swinging up... Not a man from privilege. 
Wayne's eyes close in despair. 
GORDON Miss Tate, I can't ask you - 
MIRANDA My company built it. 
GORDON Bruce Wayne built it.

SELINA You boys know you can't come into my neighborhood without asking politely. 
Gangbanger 2 lunges with a knife - she spins him, making him stab himself in the backside. The Gangbangers run off, howling. The Kid eyes her, wary. 
SELINA Never steal anything from someone you can't outrun, kid. 
KID Now you're gonna take it. 
Selina looks at the red apple. Takes one perfect bite. 
SELINA Just tax. She tosses him the apple. He takes it and runs. 
WAYNE (O.S.) Pretty generous, for a thief. Selina recognizes the voice. Turns to find Wayne - strong, but weathered. Beard, work clothes. 
SELINA You came back. I thought they'd killed you. 
WAYNE Not yet. 
SELINA If you're expecting an apology - 
WAYNE It wouldn't suit you. I need your help. 
SELINA And why would I help you? 
Wayne pulls a USB drive out of his pocket. 
WAYNE For this. The 'Clean Slate'. 
SELINA You're gonna trust me with that? After what I did to you? 
WAYNE I admit I felt a little let down. But I still think there's more to you. In fact, I think for you - (indicates USB) this isn't a tool, it's an escape route. You want to disappear. Start fresh. 
She looks at him. Takes the drive, staring at it. 
SELINA Start fresh? I can't even get off this island. 
WAYNE I can give you a way off. Once you've gotten me to Lucius Fox. I need you to find out where they're holding him. Then take me in. 
SELINA Why do you need Fox? 
WAYNE To save this city. 
SELINA Who says it needs saving? Maybe I like it this way. 
WAYNE Maybe you do. But tomorrow that bomb's going off. 
SELINA Get your powerful friend on the case. 
WAYNE I'm trying. But I need Fox.

Gordon and his Men are in two-man teams. Gordon is walking down the street with Miranda. He hands her a Geiger counter.

BLAKE 
(OVER RADIO) Heads up. 
Blake is up on a rooftop. Gordon moves down to the other end of the block. As the truck rumbles into view, Gordon's Men walk out into the street in front of it as if crossing the road. The convoy barely slows. Miranda gives Gordon the signal. As the truck comes past, he tosses a magnetic GPS locator at the lower part of the truck... 
Gordon regroups with his Men on the corner. Checks his GPS. 
GORDON Got it. 
They keep moving, turning down the next street...into an ambush. Dozens of Mercenaries, weapons trained.

Blake is grabbed by Mercenaries. They detonate the manhole, sealing it, prepare to execute Blake. A dark shape drops onto the Mercenaries... Blake watches, in awe, as Batman takes them out in a fury of punches and kicks - then it is finished. Quiet. One of the Mercenaries moves slightly. 
BLAKE You missed a spot. Batman boots him in the head as he moves towards Blake. 
BATMAN If you're working alone, wear a mask. 
BLAKE No one cares who I am. 
BATMAN The mask is not for you. It's to protect the people you care about. 
BLAKE Huh. And you always seem to know where those people are. How is that? 
BATMAN I lost someone once. Since then I break into their homes when they're sleeping and implant a tracking device on the back of their neck. 
Blake laughs. Then feels the back of his neck. Batman tosses Blake a mini-mine. 
BATMAN On three - one, two, three - They throw the mini-mines at the rubble of the entrance - the blasts barely move any rubble. 
BLAKE No offense, but you got anything bigger in that belt? 
BATMAN That's to warn the men on the other side. Batman disappears into the shadows. 
BLAKE But how do we -? KAABOOOM! The Bat's cannons light up the night. 
BLAKE Okay. 
Cops climb out into the cold night - skinny, ragged, but glad to be alive and carrying guns... 
BLAKE What now? 
BATMAN All-out assault on Bane...but you need to get the people you care about across the bridge. 
BLAKE Why? 
BATMAN In case we fail. Lead an exodus across the bridge. Save as many lives as you can. 
BLAKE Don't you need me here? 
BATMAN You've given me an army. Now go. Blake nods. Turns to leave. Stops. 
BLAKE Thank you. 
BATMAN Don't thank me yet. 
BLAKE I might not get a chance later. 
Batman nods. Blake disappears into the night. 
EXT. GOTHAM STREET - CONTINUOUS 
Gordon checks the metal box. Puts it under his coat. Nods at his men, hiding in the doorways. Checks his GPS... 
EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT 
Batman leads Catwoman to a rusty old container. He opens it, revealing the Bat-Pod. Catwoman's eyes light up. 
CATWOMAN Oh, you shouldn't have... She hops on, feeling the controls. 
BATMAN The mid-town tunnel's blocked by debris, but the cannons give you enough firepower to make a path for people. 
Catwoman marvels at the controls... 
BATMAN To start it, you - 
VARROOOM! 
CATWOMAN I got it. 
BATMAN We've got forty-five minutes to save this city - 
CATWOMAN No, I've got forty-five minutes to get clear of the blast radius, because you don't stand a chance against these guys. 
BATMAN With your help I might. 
She shakes her head. 
CATWOMAN I'll open that tunnel, then I'm gone. 
He looks at her. 
BATMAN There's more to you than that. She stares back at him. Facade slipping a touch. 
CATWOMAN Sorry to keep letting you down. He says nothing. She looks at him, imploring. Come with me. Save yourself. You don't owe these people anymore - you've given them everything... 
BATMAN Not everything. Not yet. 
Batman turns. Catwoman watches him go. Then fires up the bike and takes off. 
EXT. STREETS LEADING TO SOUTH TUNNEL - NIGHT 
Catwoman tears along on the Bat-Pod. She pulls up at the tunnel entrance blocked by stacked vehicles. 
EXT. DOWNTOWN STREETS - DAWN 
BANE Goodbye. Then is overrun. 
TALIA I climbed out of the pit... INSERT CUT: Young Talia stands by the hole looking out at the landscape... I found my father and brought him back to exact terrible vengeance - but by that time...the prisoners and the doctor had done their work to my friend...my protector... Talia reaches up to touch Bane's mask. 
INSERT CUT: the League of Shadows descend into the prison - at their head, R¯'s al Gh¯l. They slaughter prisoners. Then 
A U stop. R¯'s al Gh¯l has found Bane, bandaged. 
A U 
TALIA The League took us in. Trained us... 
INT. TEMPLE, LEAGUE OF SHADOWS - DAY 
Bane in a prototype mask, stands on logs, blocking blows from men with sticks. 
TALIA (V.O.) But my father could not accept Bane. R¯'s al Gh¯l watches Bane training. Turns away. 
A U 
INT. LOBBY, CITY HALL - CONTINUOUS 
Talia looks into Bane's eyes as she holds the knife in Batman's side. 
TALIA He saw only a monster who could never be tamed. Whose very existence was a reminder of the hell he'd left his wife to die in. He excommunicated Bane from the League of Shadows. His only crime was that he loved me. I could not truly forgive my father... Talia looks at Batman, cold. Until you murdered him. 
BATMAN He was trying to kill millions of innocent people - 
TALIA 'Innocent' is a strong word to throw around Gotham, Bruce. I honor my father by finishing his work. Vengeance against the man who killed him is simply a reward for my patience... 
Talia twists the knife in Batman's side. You see, it's the slow knife...the knife that takes its time, the 
(MORE) 
TALIA (CONT'D) knife that waits years without forgetting, then slips quietly between bones...that's the knife - Talia arms the trigger... - that cuts deepest. She hits the button - nothing. 
EXT. FIFTH STREET - CONTINUOUS 
A light on the metal box is blinking. Gordon hangs on - 
INT. LOBBY, CITY HALL - CONTINUOUS 
Talia turns, furious. 
BATMAN Your knife may have been too slow... A Mercenary steps forward - 
MERCENARY The truck's under attack - Talia looks around, mind racing. 
TALIA Gordon. (To Batman.) You gave him a way to block my signal. No matter - (Looks at watch.) He's bought Gotham eleven minutes. (Shouts at Mercenary.) Prepare a convoy. We must secure the bomb until it detonates. Talia jumps to her feet. Bane grabs a shotgun from a Mercenary - points it at Batman. 
TALIA Not yet... I want him to feel the heat. (To Batman.) Feel the fire of twelve million souls you failed. Talia reaches up to Bane's mask, reconnects his tubes, tenderly. Goodbye, my friend. Bane nods at her, slowly. Talia moves out with the Mercenaries. 
EXT. CITY HALL - CONTINUOUS 
Talia gets into a Tumbler with a Mercenary. Three Tumblers pull out in convoy, blowing anything out of the way - cars, cops. 
Foley stands in the road, firing his sidearm. Talia's Tumbler SMASHES him out of the way. 
INT. LOBBY, CITY HALL - CONTINUOUS 
Bane grabs Batman, throws him into the floor - checks the rounds in the barrels. 
BANE You'll have to imagine the fire - 
He shuts the gun - jams it into Batman's face. We both know I need to kill you now. He squeezes the trigger. BLAMMM! Bane is blasted across the lobby by cannon fire. Catwoman is there, on the Bat-Pod. 
CATWOMAN The whole no-guns thing? I don't feel as strongly about it as you do. 
EXT. GOTHAM BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS 
Blake pulls up to the barricade, leads the kids off, marching them up the bridge, Father Reilly at the rear. A Uniform shouts through the loudhailer - 
UNIFORM Stay there! What are you doing?! 
BLAKE 
(PULLS BADGE) Blake, MCU - I'm getting these boys to safety - 
UNIFORM Safety?! You're gonna get us all killed. Anyone crosses this bridge they blow the city - 
BLAKE It's gonna blow anyway. We need this bridge open right now. 
UNIFORM No one leaves the island. Orders - 
BLAKE Whose orders? Bane's? 
UNIFORM Police Department's. 
BLAKE Haven't you heard the shooting? The Batman's battling it out with Bane 
UNIFORM The Batman's dead. Look, Officer - 
BLAKE It's Detective - 
UNIFORM Well, Detective, you take one more step, we have to shoot you. Two more steps, we have to blow the bridge. 
BLAKE (to the boys) Wait for me back at the bus. The Boys walk back down the bridge... 
EXT. DOWNTOWN STREETS - CONTINUOUS 
Talia's convoy surrounds the black truck. Tumblers off each flank, protecting the bomb as it counts down... 
INT. LOBBY, CITY HALL - CONTINUOUS 
Batman looks at Catwoman. 
BATMAN I need you on the ground, me in the air, we have to force that convoy east, to the entrance to the 
REACTOR - 
TALIA There is no way to stop this bomb. Prepare yourselves... (Looks up at Batman.) My father's work is done. 
Talia smiles as her eyes flutter closed. Gordon turns - Batman is at the core, plunging his hands into the heat to attach a hoist from the Bat. 
GORDON What're you doing? 
BATMAN Two minutes. I can fly it out over the bay... 
Catwoman is at his side as he works. 
CATWOMAN Rig it out to fly over the water, then bail - 
BATMAN No autopilot. She takes this in. He stands to face her. 
CATWOMAN You could've gone anywhere. Been anything. But you came back here. 
BATMAN So did you. 
CATWOMAN I guess we're both suckers. She puts her arms around his neck. Kisses him. Batman moves to the Bat, Gordon alongside. 
GORDON So this is the part where you vanish, only this time you don't come back? 
Batman opens the canopy. 
EXT. GOTHAM BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS 
Blake grabs at the smallest boys, shoving them onto the bus. 
BLAKE Come on! On the bus! 
FATHER REILLY What're you doing? 
BLAKE Protection from the blast - 
FATHER REILLY It's an atom bomb -! 
Blake turns on Father Reilly, furious. 
BLAKE You think they need to hear that in their last seconds? You think I'm going to let them die without hope? 
EXT. TUNNEL ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS 
Gordon puts a hand on Batman's arm. 
GORDON I never cared who you were - 
BATMAN And you were right. 
GORDON But shouldn't the people know the hero who saved them? 
BATMAN A hero can be anyone. That was always the point. 
Batman sits into the cockpit, then looks again at Gordon. Anyone. A man doing something as simple and reassuring as putting a coat around a little boy's shoulders to let him know that the world hadn't ended... The canopy closes - and as the Bat fires up Gordon remembers 
INSERT CUT: Gordon, in his uniform, wraps the overcoat around the Young Bruce's shoulders, his eyes reassuring, loving. Gordon looks up to the cockpit - 
GORDON Bruce Wayne? - but is dusted by downdraft as the Bat RISES. Gordon LEAPS out of the way as the core is dragged along and out of the tunnel mouth. 
The Bat struggles with the weight of the smoking core... A building is in the way - Batman fights the controls but there's no power to get over it. 
EXT. GOTHAM BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS 
Blake shouts into the bus - 
BLAKE Heads down! Heads down, now! 
FATHER REILLY Blake, they need to make their peace. Blake turns to him, furious. 
BLAKE They're children! They have no peace to make - An EXPLOSION from downtown Gotham. Blake looks across, startled, turns to the children on the bus. Get down! This is it! The smallest of the boys stares through the window past Blake. 
LITTLE BOY No. That's Batman! Blake turns to see the Bat thundering out of the heart of Gotham, trailing smoke, the core hanging from it. It curves dangerously close to the bridge before heading for the mouth of the river...the bay...the ocean... Until a point of light fires into an enormous nuclear BLAST - wind and light and dust blowing VIOLENTLY but harmlessly over the bridge, the tunnel mouth, all of Gotham... 
As the nuclear dawn fades over Gotham, and we see its inhabitants start to raise their heads, and helicopters and boats converge on the island, we hear a voice. Jim Gordon. 
GORDON (V.O.) 'I see a beautiful city and a brilliant people rising from this abyss...' Blake pulls out his badge. Throws it into the river. 
GORDON (V.O.) 'I see the lives for which I lay down my life, peaceful, useful, prosperous and happy...' 
EXT. GARDENS, WAYNE MANOR - DAY 
Gordon is reading from A Tale of Two Cities. Opposite is Fox, arm in a sling, and Blake, grim. Another figure is there, whose face we do not yet see... 
GORDON 'I see that I hold a sanctuary in their hearts, and in the hearts of their descendants, generations hence. It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done...' Gordon closes the book, looking down at Bruce Wayne's grave. 'It is a far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known.' 
Gordon looks up at the figure standing across from him... Alfred. Tears streaming. Fox places a gentle hand on Alfred's shoulder, then leaves. Gordon and Blake follow. Alfred, alone with the Wayne family, turns to the grave beside Bruce's - the grave of Thomas and Martha Wayne. 
ALFRED I'm so sorry. I failed you. You trusted me, and I failed you. And the old man's shoulders begin to shake with sobs. 
EXT. FRONT ENTRANCE, WAYNE MANOR - CONTINUOUS 
Gordon nods at Lucius. Blake is at Gordon's side. 
GORDON Can I change your mind about quitting the force? 
BLAKE No. What you said about structures. About shackles. I can't take it. The injustice. (Gestures at gardens.) I mean...no one's ever going to know who saved an entire city. 
GORDON They know. (Off look.) It was Batman. 
EXT. PLAZA, DOWNTOWN GOTHAM - DAY 
Gordon, on a platform with dignitaries, watches a statue being unveiled. The curtain parts: Batman, immortalized in granite. We move in on the stone face... 
VOICE (V.O.) Mr. Wayne's will was not amended to reflect his more modest estate... 
INT. LAWYER'S OFFICE - DAY 
The voice belongs to Wayne's lawyer, addressing a small group. 
LAWYER Nonetheless, there are considerable assets to dispose of... The contents of the house are to be

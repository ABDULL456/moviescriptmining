Shooting Script 
FADE IN: 
CLOSE ON A MASSIVE STEEL HEAD 
Our first thought: DR. DOOM?  But it's not moving.  A welder's torch sparks into frame in the hands of a sculptor on scaffolding.  This is art, an epic 20 foot statue going up of a business mogul (VICTOR VON DOOM) in whose generously extended hands sit two intertwined columns of DNA.  His face is chiseled, angular, perfect (too perfect).  Past sparks, we MOVE down to pick up... 
EXT. STREET/VON DOOM INDUSTRIES TOWER - DAY 
REED RICHARDS and BEN GRIMM head toward the soaring glass-box atrium of VDI Headquarters.  Designed to inspire awe, it does. 
REED High open space, exposed structural elements.  Obviously aimed at first time visitors to create feelings of... smallness, inadequacy. 
Ben glances at Reed, who looks a little nervous. 
BEN Good thing it ain't workin... Reed, what are we doing here?  This guy's fast-food, strip-mall science -- 
REED This wasn't our first stop, in case you forgot NASA.  And Victor's not that bad.  He's just a little... (seeing the statue) Larger than life. 
INT. VON DOOM INDUSTRIES TOWER - DAY 
They move past the statue, into the sprawling atrium. 
REED He's financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century. 
BEN You'd never know it. 
He motions to a high-tech ORB, showing FOOTAGE of VDI's accomplishments: a safe and clean nuclear facility, the first private Space Station. 
All images have VICTOR front and center, glad-handling George Bush, Tony Blair, shady International Leaders.  The last image is Victor holding the AMERICA'S CUP. 
BEN (CONT'D) Jesus.  That too? 
They reach three stern RECEPTIONISTS. 
REED Reed Richards and Ben Grimm to see -- 
A receptionist cuts him off, handing them each a pass. 
FEMALE RECEPTIONIST Executive elevator, top floor. 
BEN What's the price for a smile round here? 
They head for the elevator.  Reed carries a small, black box. As they enter the elevator, steel doors shut and we CUT TO -- 
INT. VON DOOM INDUSTRIES TOWER - OFFICE - DAY 
A large, dark office.  Ben in the corner.  He yawns, watches... 
BRIGHT HOLOGRAMS: Stars.  Planets.  They hover in the air, making the room feel like a majestic portal into outer space. 
REED (O.S.) My research suggests that exposure to a high-energy cosmic storm born on solar winds might have triggered the evolution of early planetary life. 
REED stands among the holograms, speaking to a MYSTERIOUS FIGURE in shadow behind a desk.  An ominous, PULSATING RED CLOUD covers the stars.  It washes over a hologram of EARTH. 
REED (CONT'D) In six weeks another cloud with the same elemental profile will pass Earth's orbit.  A study in space could advance our knowledge about the structure of the human genome, and help cure countless diseases, extend human life -- 
The SHADOW clears his throat.  Reed speeds up, emotional. 
REED (CONT'D) Give kids the chance to be stronger, healthier, less prone to -- 
SHADOWED FIGURE Turn it off.  Please. 
The figure's DEEP VOICE pierces the darkness. 
REED But I haven't fully explained my -- 
SHADOWED FIGURE Yes you have... Imagination. Creativity.  Passion.  Those were always your trademarks. 
Lights brighten, revealing the face behind the voice: VICTOR VON DOOM.  35, handsome, commanding.  He looks almost... airbrushed.  He drops a WIRED magazine to the desk.  REED is on the cover over the words: RICHARDS BANKRUPT, GRANT CUTBACKS. 
VICTOR But dreams don't pay the bills, do they? (a condescending smile) Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist. Still reaching for the stars, with the world on your back. 
REED You remember in school we talked about working together.  That's what I was about to explain... 
Reed presses the remote.  Another hologram appears: A SHUTTLE slowly approaching AN ORBITING SPACE STATION.  Both bear the VON DOOM INDUSTRIES logo.  Victor smiles, more intrigued. 
VICTOR So it's not my money you want.  It's my toys... Tell me: if NASA doesn't trust you, why should I? 
Victor is a step ahead.  Reed pauses, thrown for a beat.  Ben wakes up, suspicious.  Victor notices.  He notices everything. 
VICTOR (CONT'D) That's my job.  To stay a step ahead. To know what other men don't. 
Ben gets close to Reed, turning toward the door. 
BEN I can't take this. 
He nods, head down.  He doesn't want eye contact. 
REED Those solar winds are flaring, but I factored them into my coordinates and -- 
SUE I was talking about us.  Working together. 
Sue holds her eyes on Reed.  He is clearly uncomfortable in her gaze.  Did the elevator just get smaller? 
REED (thinking, talking fast) Well, uh, based on our history...you can handle the biogenetics, and I'll focus on the molecular physics.  Or, uhm, maybe I should take the biotech, you work the microscopes, since you have some background in electropho-- 
SUE (droll, a little annoyed) Right.  That's exactly what I meant. 
She shakes her head -- same old Reed.  He looks at her -- what did he say wrong?  Ben smiles, patting Reed on the shoulder. 
BEN Way to not overthink it. (to Sue) So when do we leave? 
SUE I'll schedule the launch.  Call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew. 
She offers a business card.  Reed doesn't take it. 
REED I, uh, think I remember the number. 
SUE It's been changed. 
Beat.  Ben grimaces.  Reed takes the card, his eyes down. 
REED As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission -- 
SUE Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun, but we already have a pilot on our payroll.  You remember my brother Johnny... 
Off Ben's curdling smile, we DISSOLVE TO -- 
EXT. LAKE LAUNCH FACILITY - DAY 
A helicopter shot through trees.  We soar over timberland, and find something massive looming on the horizon: 
A SPACECRAFT.  A sleek take on a space shuttle.  Modern tech combined with industrial design that NASA could never afford. The craft's nose is pointed straight up, ready for launch. WORKERS IN JUMPSUITS are scattered around the two-hundred foot tall scaffolding, performing routine checks. 
EXT. GANTRY OVERLOOK - DAY 
Ben stares up at the craft.  A sneer on his face. 
BEN Can't do it.  I cannot do it. 
REED External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in -- 
BEN No.  I cannot take orders from that underwear model.  That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator. 
REED Youthful high spirits. 
They walk toward the base of the scaffolding. 
BEN They crashed it into a wall.  A flight simulator. 
REED I'm sure he's matured since then. 
CLOSE on JOHNNY STORM, leaning over to kiss a hot redhead. PULL BACK TO REVEAL he's riding a MOTORCYCLE, and she's driving a red CORVETTE with license plate: FRANKIE.  PICK UP Reed and Ben, watching through binoculars. 
REED (CONT'D) When have I asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do? 
BEN Five times. 
REED I had it at four. 
BEN This makes five. 
INT. LAKE LAUNCH FACILITY LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT 
Reed and Ben unpack gear into lockers.  Suddenly -- 
JOHNNY (O.S.) Captain on the bridge! 
Ben goes to attention on reflex: Johnny snaps a picture with a digital camera.  Then advances, as Ben realizes who it is... 
JOHNNY (CONT'D) Digital camera: $254.  Memory stick: $59.  The look on your hard-ass former CO's grill when he finds out he's your junior officer: priceless. 
Ben eyeballs Johnny, suddenly reaches up as if to grab him. Johnny flinches.  But Ben just reaches for Johnny's zipper, adjusts his uniform. 
BEN I can handle the ship.  I can even handle Mr. Blonde Ambition.  But I don't know if I should be flying or playing Vegas in these suits.  Who the hell came up with them? 
SUE Victor did. 
Sue enters, wearing her blue, wetsuit-like uniform, carrying a stack of flightsuits.  She hands them out to the guys. 
SUE (CONT'D) The synthetics act as a second skin, adapting to your individual needs to -- 
JOHNNY Keep the hot side hot, and the cool side cool! 
REED Wow.  Fantastic. 
Reed stares at Sue in the skintight outfit.  She wonders, maybe hopes -- is he actually checking her out? 
REED (CONT'D) Material made from self-regulating unstable molecules.  I've been working on a formula for this. 
SUE Great minds think alike. 
EXT. DEEP SPACE - SAME 
THE SPACE STATION in the distance, rotating in orbit above Earth.  THE SHUTTLE eases in and docks. 
INT. SPACE STATION - COMMAND CENTER - SAME 
Victor and Sue lead the others into the command center. 
JOHNNY (a "dad voice": to Ben) If you behave, maybe next time daddy'll let you drive. 
BEN Keep talking, there won't be a next time. 
Reed is focused on THE EARTH. 
SUE Long way from the projection booth at the Hayden Planetarium, isn't it? 
Reed turns towards her -- a little stunned that she would bring that up.  It's the first time she's been nice to him so far.  He smiles, gently, hesitantly, always hesitant with Sue. 
REED Yes.  Yes it is. 
Johnny and Ben exchange a look.  Reed keeps looking at the stars, eyes wide, like a little kid. 
INT. SPACE STATION - COMMAND CENTER/OBSERVATION DECK - SAME 
They enter the nerve center of the space station.  Victor goes to a computer console on the observation deck below. The windows are closed, so there's nothing to observe. 
VICTOR (to ground; via comm-link) Leonard, how's the feed? 
LEONARD (V.O.) Recording, sir.  We see you perfectly. 
Victor glances at a camera mounted into the console. 
SUE We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here. 
BEN Is it safe? 
REED The shields on the station should protect us. 
BEN Should? 
VICTOR What's wrong, Ben?  Eighty-million dollars worth of equipment not enough for you? 
Ben turns to Victor.  A little tension.  Reed cuts it: 
REED Let's start loading those samples. Get your suit ready, Ben. 
Victor keeps his eyes on Ben. 
VICTOR So you still do all the heavy lifting? 
Victor gives a friendly smile, patting Reed. 
VICTOR (CONT'D) Maybe you should have stayed back in the lab.  Field work never suited you. 
Reed doesn't defend himself.  Ben steps up. 
BEN He does the talking.  I do the walking.  Got it? 
Victor holds tight to his smile.  He nods, condescending. 
VICTOR Got it.  So take a walk, Ben...I'm going to borrow Susan for a second. 
REED Sure. 
Ben and Johnny read his eyes, as we CUT TO -- 
INT. SPACE STATION - AIR LOCK - LATER 
Ben preps for a space walk, putting on a helmet and boots. Johnny unloads a set of clear sample boxes off of a cart, each containing a variety of plants. 
JOHNNY Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister. 
BEN 'Course not.  Strictly business. 
JOHNNY Yeah, well, his eyes say different. 
BEN Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either. 
JOHNNY Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God?  Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp.  Hmmm, it's a toss-up. 
BEN Put your tiny little mind at ease. 
JOHNNY Don't you wander off, boy. 
Johnny steps out of the air-lock and shuts the door.  He looks through a small window to see Ben give the thumbs up. THE AIRLOCK DOOR opens, and Ben gracefully steps into space. 
INT. SPACE STATION - OBSERVATION DECK - SAME TIME 
Sue descends the stairs at Victor's behest.  Joins him. 
VICTOR Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal? 
SUE I understand the business reasons. 
VICTOR Well, when you're looking at your future, it never hurts to find closure about the past. 
Reed exits, dropping his two wilted lilies into the trash. 
Sue opens one eye, as the big lilies land by the bed. 
INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY 
A SEXY NURSE wheels a testing station into Johnny's room. He's stripped down to Calvins, changing into a ski outfit. 
SEXY NURSE And where do we think we're going? 
JOHNNY I don't know if "we've" noticed, but the sickest runs this side of the Alps are right outside that window -- 
NURSE I've noticed... But doctor's orders, you're not allowed to leave until we -- 
JOHNNY Finish the tests, I know -- could you give me a hand with this zipper? 
NURSE You know this is not a ski resort. 
JOHNNY Not yet. 
Johnny opens the cardboard box, revealing a colorful fiberglass object the size of a briefcase.  In the blink of an eye, he unfolds it into a LONG SNOWBOARD. 
JOHNNY (CONT'D) Luckily grandma still sends care packages. 
The nurse pops a thermometer in his mouth to shut him up. 
NURSE You are trouble. 
JOHNNY (thermometer in his mouth) Brubbles my Triddle Name. 
They both pay more attention to his zipper than the digital read-out: it runs right up past 98.6, then accelerates fast. 
SEXY NURSE You're hot! 
JOHNNY So are you! 
SEXY NURSE I mean, you feel a little feverish. 
JOHNNY I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work? 
SEXY NURSE My shift ends at four, but I couldn't -- 
JOHNNY Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up. 
He hands her the thermometer, a quick kiss and he's out the door.  The machine beeps: Johnny's temperature is 209 DEGREES. 
EXT. VON DOOM COMPOUND HOSPITAL PATIO - DAY 
Ben finds Reed on a patio with a panoramic view.  Reed works at a laptop computer. 
BEN How long was I out? 
REED Three days.  I was worried about you. How are you feeling? 
BEN Solid. 
Ben can see Reed doesn't look too solid. 
BEN (CONT'D) How you doing? 
Reed shakes his head, looking back at his screen. 
REED I don't know.  I just keep going over and over the numbers. 
BEN Reed.  Even you can't compute every little thing. 
REED I should have done more, run more tests -- 
Ben gets closer, pushing down Reed's computer screen. 
BEN It was a freak of nature.  Last I checked, you don't have a crystal ball.  Let it go. 
Reed considers.  But he can't let it go.  He opens his computer back up, returning to work.  Ben shakes his head, looks out at the view.  His eyes catch on something, wheels turning. 
BEN (CONT'D) You go through something like this, makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life. 
REED Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect -- 
BEN Reed, I'm not talking about Debbie. 
Reed follows Ben's eyes to a lower level patio: SUE. 
REED What?  Come on.  She's got a good thing with Victor -- 
BEN I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws? 
REED He's smart, powerful, successful -- 
BEN Well maybe you should date him. 
Reed looks at Ben, resigned. 
REED Ben.  He'll give her the life she deserves.  She ended up with the right guy.  Things worked out for the best. 
Reed steps away.  Ben stands alone, an idea sparking. 
BEN (CONT'D) Hey Reed, what are you doing here? (before he can answer) Great, why don't you join us? 
He quickly shepherds the two of them toward a quiet table. Ben's stomach GROWLS; so loud that they all can hear it. 
BEN (CONT'D) God, I'm starving.  Gonna hit the buffet. 
Ben's stomach growls again, even louder this time. 
INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND DINING HALL - EVENING 
The sun is long gone, and so are most of the diners.  The room is darker, more romantic.  Ben finishes the last shrimp on his plate, pushes it away, belches prodigiously. 
BEN Pardon me... 
Sue and Reed stare at him.  Ben's stomach growls again. 
REED Are you alright? 
BEN I think I need to lie down.  Bad shrimp. 
This was Ben's plan, but he really isn't feeling well, unsteady when he walks away.  He looks down at his stomach. 
BEN (CONT'D) Really bad shrimp. 
ANGLE: Fireplace.  Sue looks gorgeous in the light.  A beat. A long beat.  Reed doesn't know where to start with this woman. 
REED Feeling better? 
SUE Yes, thanks. 
REED That's good.  That's uh...good. 
SUE You always had a way with words. (an awkward beat) I should be getting back. 
Sue gets up to leave.  Exasperated, Reed tries to think of something, anything, to say. 
REED I'm really happy for you and Victor. 
She slows down, looking at him.  She was hoping for more. 
SUE You're happy for me and Victor. 
REED I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship -- 
SUE Which was? 
REED Passion. 
We see surprise on Sue's face, and... 
REED (CONT'D) For science. 
SUE (frustrated) You are such a dork, Reed... You never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics. 
As if triggered by her emotion, the fireplace light around her BENDS.  The flames flicker in a ghostly breeze. 
REED What?  What did I say? 
She looks more disappointed than angry. 
SUE It's never what you say.  It's what you don't say. What you don't do... 
She lets that hang.  A lot of history here.  Quiet, hurt -- she wants Reed to fight for her, to show some emotion. 
REED I...I...I just wanted to -- 
As Sue's emotions swirl, she slowly...disappears. 
SUE It's been two years, and all you can say is you're happy for me and some other guy... (standing up, hurt) You know, Victor may be a lot of things, but at least he's not afraid to fight for what he wants... (Reed looks down) And it's nice to be wanted sometimes. To be heard...seen... Reed, look at me. 
He looks up...but all that's left of her is the blush on her cheek and her bewitching eyes.  He drops his fork, shocked. 
REED Uh, Sue...?  I can't. 
SUE What?  What do you mean you -- 
REED Sue...look at your hands. 
She raises her hands, but we don't see them.  We only see a medical waistband...floating.  Her watch...floating.  Her clothes appear to be suspended in mid-air. 
Sue is invisible.  She shrieks and gets up -- knocking a GLASS off the table... 
SLOW MOTION: The glass flies off the table, tumbling... Reed instinctively reaches for the bottle: his arm stretches two feet out of his sleeve -- grabs it just before it hits -- 
Then snaps back into place.  Reed stares at his arm in disbelief.  Sue's eyes widen as well.  The rest of Sue reappears.  They look at each other: mutual alarm. 
JOHNNY (O.S.) You guys will not believe what just happened! 
They look up to see JOHNNY in the doorway, NAKED except for the nurse's PINK PARKA wrapped around his midsection. 
INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - VICTOR'S OFFICE - EARLY EVENING 
CLUNK.  The candles burn low on the table.  Victor strides out, heading for the door.  He runs his hand through his hair to comb some strays.  A CLUMP comes off in his fingers.  He PAUSES.  He steps to a mirror, stares at his hair.  His SCAR. 
It is longer than the bandage now (as if it SPREAD).  Victor peels back the bandage, and sees the scar is bluish-gray. Deep, unhealthy, maybe infected... 
REED He's had some kind of...reaction to exposure from the cloud.  And he's not the only one. 
SUE We need to find him. 
Victor redirects his attention to Sue. 
SUE (CONT'D) Victor, I'm sorry I -- 
VICTOR (cold) Just find him. 
Victor strides off, leaving the others. 
JOHNNY Anybody know where the big guy's going? 
We PUSH IN on a picture of Debbie lying on the floor, Reed knows exactly where Ben is going. 
REED He's going home. 
EXT. TRAIN YARD - NIGHT 
A view from Brooklyn: Manhattan glistens in the distance. CAMERA MOVES down to A TRAIN YARD, where we find empty cargo trains.  We PUSH IN on the main track, where... 
A CARGO TRAIN has just stopped.  We hear a cargo DOOR slide open, then WHUMP!  Big FEET hit the ground.  Someone, or someTHING barrels into the night. 
EXT. BIG & TALL SHOP - NIGHT 
A locked storefront on Flatbush Ave.  SOUND of breaking glass. 
INT. BIG & TALL SHOP - NIGHT 
SERIES OF SHOTS: Ben tries on clothes, shoes.  Jackets rip, shoes split.  He needs an extra extra extra large. 
EXT. PAY PHONE - NIGHT 
A HUGE FIGURE is huddled in shadow.  It's Ben. 
CLOSE ON: The dial pad.  Big fingers try to push keys but they're too large.  Ben tries for a few seconds, getting more and more frustrated.  He manages to press "0" with his pinky. 
BEN Hello, Operator? 
Ben looks up the street, into the 2nd story window of a modest, working-class home.  His eyes go soft when he sees Debbie grab the phone. 
BEN (CONT'D) Deb... It's me.  I need you to step out front. 
DEBBIE Out front?  You home, baby?  I got a surprise for you. 
He blinks hard.  Sad, dark. 
BEN I got a surprise for you too. 
EXT. BROOKLYN HOUSE - NIGHT 
Debbie steps out.  There is "WELCOME HOME" sign over the door.  She looks out.  The wind blows softly.  Something shifts in the darkness.  Debbie pulls her robe tighter. 
DEBBIE Ben? 
BEN (O.S.) Don't come any closer for a sec.  This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said "together forever no matter what"? 
DEBBIE Baby, you're scaring me. 
A hanging beat.  And Ben...steps into the light, where we SEE HIM FOR THE FIRST TIME: he's HUGE, easily twice the size he once was, and AN ORANGY ROCKY SURFACE COVERS HIS ENTIRE BODY. 
Debbie sees him.  Fear washes over her, not sure what to think.  He reaches out, a little tentative.  She flinches back. 
DEBBIE Oh my G-g-g.  What did you...do to Ben? 
BEN Deb, it's me.  It's still me. 
He reaches out.  She recoils.  It's too much for her.  Tears swell in her eyes.  Covering her mouth, she backs away. 
He takes a step closer.  She backs away faster, tripping over her robe, falling into the street.  A car screeches to a halt.  Ben instinctively steps out to help, but she scurries back. 
DEBBIE Don't...don't...DON'T TOUCH ME! 
Her shout wakes NEIGHBORS.  Lights flicker on.  Ben knows he has to go.  He looks at Debbie, sensing this is the last time he'll see her.  She trembles, terrified.  His eyes go moist. 
BEN I love you, Deb. 
With that, he turns away.  The "WELCOME HOME" sign flutters, falls to the ground.  A tragic tableau.  As more lights go on around him, Ben picks up his pace, speeding into the dawn. 
INT. VICTOR'S COMPOUND OFFICE - DAY 
Victor packs a monogrammed Armani briefcase: "VDM" emblazoned on a gold plate.  Leonard waits not-so-patiently. 
VICTOR Make sure you find Ben, bring him back here.  And keep it quiet.  I don't need this to hit the press. 
LEONARD Yes sir.  You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal -- 
VICTOR Front page? 
LEONARD Top left, like you asked. (a smile) Today Wall Street.  Tomorrow, who knows...maybe Washington. 
Victor turns to Leonard, disappointed with him. 
VICTOR Leonard.  Think bigger. 
He motions to her body.  She understands.  She concentrates, and starts to turn invisible. 
BRIDGE COP #1 What the hell is this?  A magic show? 
But her clothes don't go invisible.  Beat.  Reed mutters: 
REED Sue.  Your clothes.  Lose them. 
SUE What...? (realizes) Oh. 
She unbuttons her blouse.  Not thrilled with the idea.  She wriggles out of her pants.  Down to her skivvies.  She reaches back to undo her bra...momentarily loses concentration and becomes visible.  The sight of Sue in her undies grabs the COPS' attention.  Everyone watches, stunned. 
The realization that she's visible hits her like a ton of bricks.  Cops are transfixed.  So is Reed. 
JOHNNY This is wrong in so many ways. 
REED You've been working out. 
SUE Shut up. 
Sue takes a deep breath.  Closes her eyes.  Focuses.  Nothing happens.  She's embarrassed and furious. 
SUE (CONT'D) Any more ideas, Reed?  Maybe you should strip down next, see how it feels to have fifty people staring -- 
...and she DISAPPEARS.  Entirely.  Undies float.  Jaws drop. 
REED Uh, Sue? 
She stops ranting.  Realizes she's gone invisible. 
SUE (INVISIBLE) Oh.  Well then... 
The undies drop.  The cops stare open-mouthed.  They turn to look at Reed, astonished.  He sheepishly shrugs his shoulders. 
JOHNNY I'm gonna need serious therapy. 
A beat.  She walks away.  The cops watch her, gaping.  By the time they turn back around, Reed and Johnny are gone, disappearing into the clouds of smoke. 
EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DAY 
A news CHOPPER flies around the bridge, fighting for the best angle on the action. 
EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - ACCIDENT - DAY 
Reed races through wreckage.  He tries to see over a big TRUCK, and his neck STREEETCHES! 
He finally sees...BEN.  Reed wraps around a car, and...BOO! His face snakes right in front of Ben.  Ben jumps. 
BEN What the --! 
REED Ben.  Are you okay? 
BEN Am I okay?!  You wanna explain that?! 
He motions to Reed's neck.  Then to his own body: 
BEN (CONT'D) Or this?!  What the hell am I? 'Cause I sure ain't Ben anymore. 
Reed opens his mouth, but he has no answer.  Not yet. 
SUE (O.S.) REED!  BEN!  LOOK OUT! 
Ben spins, looking for Sue.  He can't see her.  But he does see...A CAR INCHES AWAY, WITH GAS TANK FLAMING! 
BOOOOM!  The first car BLOWS!  BOOOM!BOOOOM!BOOOOOM!  Empty cars BLOW in a chain-reaction.  The flames are mushrooming! 
Reed SWIPES his ARMS OUT, holding people back.  His arms FLATTEN to form a barricade -- FACES INDENT his skin. 
FLAMES lash out.  A pack of attractive YOUNG WOMEN scream. Johnny LEAPS toward them.  His feet LEAVE THE GROUND, giving him extra lift.  He SPINS, lands, and embraces the women, SHIELDING them from flames which burn up his back.  He looks the ladies up and down, and gives a cheesy smile. 
Sue SCREAMS.  She puts her hands up (a normal reflex).  The air seems to RIPPLE around her hands, like FORCE-FIELDS. 
She looks at them, surprised, confused.  Her invisible fields SPIRAL OUT, partially CONTAINING the blast.  But the flames hurtle closer.  She fights the pressure.  Blood trickles from her nose.  Just as the white hot blast is about to hit her... 
Sue is dressed again.  Visible.  She SCREAMS, and PUSHES THE FORCE DOWN INTO THE ROAD!  She collapses, as the blast deflects off the street and into... 
An oncoming FIRETRUCK!  BOOOOM!  The firetruck is KNOCKED OFF THE GROUND, SLEWING SIDEWAYS.  Brakes scream.  Its tail slashes out, PUNCHING through the guard-rail. 
THE BACK OF THE TRUCK DANGLES OUT, HUNDREDS OF FEET ABOVE THE WATER!  FIREMEN hang off the back and sides.  The truck TEETERS, falling!  Ben wastes no time.  He GRABS onto the front of the truck, just as it goes off the side! 
He DIGS his heels into the ground, but his feet DRAG across the concrete, digging grooves into the street. 
ON THE DANGLING FIRETRUCK: FIREMEN climb out, clawing toward the bridge.  Their truck SWINGS.  Bits and pieces tumble down at them -- a hose, an axe, a helmet.  All deadly now.  The HANGING LADDER swoops down, with men RIDING ON IT! 
Ben SCREAMS!  STRAINING with all his might.  Ben SCREAMS! His muscles ripple, and...he takes his first step...back. Another scream.  Another step.  Another.  Another.  Epic, painful. 
He is pulling the truck back onto the bridge, inch by inch. His footsteps THUD.  With monumental effort, he levels the truck.  Firemen scurry over hoses and ladders, some climbing over Ben. 
Reed tends to Sue who has fainted from her effort.  Ben steps back from the truck and slumps to the street exhausted.  Wary cops close in to cover him with weapons, but... 
The FIREMEN slowly begin to APPLAUD.  The crowd of onlookers joins in as well.  Sue, Reed, and Johnny seem surprised, touched by the reaction.  But Ben seems uncomfortable. 
Firemen step forward to offer Reed a couple of their coats; he hands one to Johnny and uses the other to cover Sue. 
EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DAY 
Reed, Sue, and Ben get up to go.  The press waits a beat, then surges.  Ben spins, holding up one finger.  A giant. 
BEN Be nice. 
The press step back, intimidated.  Flashbulbs POP, and Ben's FACE FREEZES.  It goes BLACK-AND-WHITE on a NEW YORK POST in -- 
EXT. BANK - DAY 
Establishing shot of a historic New York building. 
INT. BANK - CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
BANKERS sit around a table.  LAPTOPS hum.  The lead banker is power-broker NED CECIL.  The men keep their eyes on Victor. 
NED CECIL Well, Victor, the bank would like to congratulate you.  On the fastest freefall since the Depression.  We can't even give your stock away. 
VICTOR Ned, you know I can turn this around. 
Ned motions to the paper, the picture of BEN. 
NED CECIL You promised a cure-all, and came back with this.  Who the hell's going to invest in a biotech company that turns its workers into circus freaks? 
Victor's grip tightens around the table, and...the LAPTOPS FLICKER, losing feeds. 
Victor looks down at his hands -- a private beat (did I do that?)  He lets go of the table; screens go back to normal. 
VICTOR (pointed) I really appreciate all your support. 
NED CECIL You've got a week, Victor.  One week to turn this around.  Or we pull out... (a beat) This meeting is over. 
Victor looks at him, blood boiling, and we CUT HARD TO -- 
INT. BANK - HALLWAY - DAY 
Victor and Leonard stride out.  Victor is writhing. 
VICTOR Goddamn book-keeper doesn't know preferred stock from livestock. 
Leonard is thinking all business. 
LEONARD Sir.  Reed's comments at that press conference killed us.  How are we going to turn this around? 
Victor considers.  His mind races, eyes narrow. 
VICTOR Very simple.  I cure them.  If I can cure these freaks, then I can cure anyone.  What better way to restore my reputation? 
Leonard nods, impressed.  Victor is a man in motion.  As they step into sunlight, we cut to...CLICKCLICKCLICK in -- 
EXT. BAXTER BUILDING - DAY 
REPORTERS snap pictures.  A POLICE CONVOY drives up, stopping in front of a towering HIGH-RISE.  Sue, Reed, and Johnny and get out of a police-car. Ben steps out of a BIG PADDY-WAGON, which immediately bounces back up to the normal axle position. 
COPS hold back the surging press.  Ben keeps his head down, self-conscious.  He passes Johnny, smiling for the cameras. 
JOHNNY Smile, Ben.  They want to like you. Give 'em your good side.  Or your less bad side. 
Ben turns to a group of LITTLE KIDS.  Stiff, tentative: 
BEN Uh...don't do drugs. 
The kids FLINCH.  Ben trudges on.  Johnny smiles bright, doing hand-signs for F4.  Sue pulls him toward -- 
INT. BAXTER BUILDING - LOBBY - DAY 
The Fantastic Four enter.  They are greeted by JIMMY O'HOOLIHAN, an old-time doorman with a kind smile. 
O'HOOLIHAN Welcome back to the Baxter, Dr. Richards.  All that for you? 
He motions to the flashing cameras outside. 
REED I'm afraid so... 
He searches for the name.  Sue steps up. 
SUE Jimmy.  Good to see you again. 
He smiles at Sue, then at Reed. 
O'HOOLIHAN Good to see you too... Don't worry, sir.  I know how crowded that head of yours is. 
REED Any visitors while I was away? 
O'HOOLIHAN Just the usual.  Told 'em you were circling round outer space. 
He opens a drawer full of LETTERS from the BANK.  Reed looks sheepish.  He shuts the drawer, looks to Johnny and Sue. 
REED We had a tough year. 
BEN Yeah, nine years straight. 
Reed looks at Ben.  Thanks a lot.  DING.  Elevator doors open. 
INT. BAXTER BUILDING - ELEVATOR - DAY 
They enter.  Reed hits the top button, for the 20TH FLOOR. 
Reed looks at his hand.  Shakes his wrist.  He looks at Victor. 
INT. BAXTER BUILDING - HALL - DAY 
Victor moves fast, holds tight to his anger.  Reed catches up. 
REED Victor wait... I just wanted to say, I'm sorry the mission didn't go as planned -- 
Victor suddenly WHEELS on Reed.  Lights flicker. 
VICTOR Didn't go as planned?  It was a catastrophe.  You ruined the lives of four people -- 
REED I ruined?  With all due respect, I told you to abort -- 
VICTOR Abort?  Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will not let you make me look like a fool -- 
REED Victor, if we could understand what happened to us -- 
VICTOR I don't want to understand it.  This isn't one of your science projects.  I just want to fix it.  Fast! 
Reed sees Victor's SCAR maybe growing.  Lights dim. 
VOICE (O.S.) There a problem, Vic? 
They turn to see...BEN down the hall, leaning in a doorway. Victor tightens, looking at Ben's massive rock-hewn body. 
VICTOR No problem, Ben. 
He turns back to Reed.  Close, quiet.  Lights flicker. 
VICTOR (CONT'D) Just pay your goddamn electric bill, and get to work on a cure. 
Victor steps away, toward the elevator.  He passes Ben, who just smiles and waves "goodbye."  Before Victor's finger taps the down-button, the button lights up (as if the circuit responded to him).  Reed exhales, shaken.  Victor steps into -- 
INT. BAXTER BUILDING - ELEVATOR - DAY 
The doors close, and Victor really LETS LOOSE.  He SLAMS his fist into a STEEL WALL.  The wall BUCKLES, steel DENTING. 
Victor shakes out his hand, and sees...a rippling METALLIC SHELL under the skin.  He stares at it in horror.  The dark surface pulsates with electric energy.  What is he becoming...? 
INT. BAXTER BUILDING LABS - DAY 
Sue works the controls.  Reed approaches Ben with an ELECTRODE NEEDLE.  He tries to stick the needle into Ben, but it SNAPS. 
BEN You got a chisel round here? 
REED If we're going to identify the source of the mutation, we need to isolate your recombinant DNA so we can activate positional genomes. 
Ben looks to Sue for translation. 
SUE We need to give you a physical, so we know what got zapped. 
BEN Well why didn't you say so?  You want me to lift some weights or something? 
Reed shakes his head.  He approaches with an X-RAY MACHINE. 
REED No, just sit back.  We have a good sense of your strength from the firetruck.  We need to find the source of your strength. 
He turns on the X-ray machine.  The graph shows SOLID ROCK. The rays don't penetrate.  Sue and Reed look confused. 
BEN How bad is it?  You know I used to smoke. 
Reed grabs a BLOOD PRESSURE MACHINE, but the strap is way too short to wrap around Ben's arm.  Reed stands stumped.  He looks at his tray full of instruments.  He picks up the little rubber REFLEX-HAMMER.  But it looks miniscule compared to Ben. 
Reed has an idea.  He opens a drawer full of HARDWARE TOOLS. He pulls of a real HAMMER.  He approaches Ben. 
REED Okay, this might smart a little. 
He taps Ben's knee lightly, and BEN'S LEG KICKS!  SLAMMING UP!  RIGHT BETWEEN REED'S LEGS!  The ultimate kick in the crotch.  Reed STRETCHES UP a few feet, then SNAPS BACK, wincing. 
REED (CONT'D) (high-pitched voice) We'll...continue this later. 
INT. BAXTER BUILDING LABS - DAY 
From their second level control room, Reed and Sue observe Johnny in an enclosed fire-proof chamber.  Flames escape through the vents of the chamber...he's fully torched! 
Reed watches the read-out: it climbs from 2000 to 4000 degrees Kelvin.  They are essentially taking his temperature. 
INSIDE THE CHAMBER: Johnny turns white hot, blinding to look at: the chamber walls begin to glow red.  Machines go haywire. 
His feet even start to LIFT OFF THE GROUND, LEVITATING a foot or two.  He looks down, excited, burning hotter and hotter. 
REED Back it down, Johnny! 
JOHNNY I can go hotter! 
He won't stop.  Reed pulls a switch on the wall.  FOAM sprays out of nozzles, dousing Johnny's flames.  He stands there, covered in thick FOAM.  His body steams.  So does his temper. 
JOHNNY (CONT'D) You're really cramping my style here. 
SUE You were at 4000 Kelvin.  Any hotter, you're approaching supernova -- 
JOHNNY Sweet. 
SUE That's the temperature of the sun. 
REED I think it was a little more complicated than -- 
SUE I just wanted to share an apartment. What was so complicated about that? 
The question stumps him.  A beat.  He struggles. 
REED There were a lot of variables to consider -- 
SUE No.  There weren't.  There was you. And me.  No variables, no math.  It was actually the simplest thing in the world.  But your head got in the way... like it always does. 
Her words penetrate.  He knows she's right.  He looks away. 
REED Sue...I just...I thought... 
He struggles for the words. 
SUE Same old Reed.  Too much thinking... 
He opens his mouth, but...WHAM!  Doors open.  Johnny enters, wearing a CHARRED SHIRT.  He points to the burned scraps of his shirt. 
JOHNNY Okay guys, we have a serious problem. 
INT. BAXTER BUILDING LABS - DAY 
ANGLES of Reed in the lab, grabbing their space uniforms from various closets/containers: 
REED (V.O.) Our uniforms were exposed to the storm like us.  So they can transform like us, becoming invisible, changing size on demand or remaining impervious to flame. 
REVEAL: Reed, Sue, and Johnny step out to look at themselves in a mirror wearing the uniforms.  No boots, no gloves.  Not yet.  (The uniforms will develop, like our heroes). 
BEN You look like an eighties rock band. 
SUE (to Ben) The suit will stretch.  You should try it -- 
BEN I wouldn't be caught dead in that. 
JOHNNY He's right.  These costumes are... missing something.  I can't put my finger on it -- 
REED They're not costumes. 
SUE We're not taking them out.  Johnny, we need to stay here till we've stabilized. 
Johnny shakes his head, frustrated. 
JOHNNY I'm getting sick of being trapped here.  NASA wasn't even this strict! 
He marches out.  Sue turns to Reed, who says nothing.  Sue heads out, leaving Ben and Reed.  A beat.  Ben looks at Reed. 
BEN (looking at uniform) Maybe it's missing a utility belt. 
Off Reed's dark look, we hear: 
VICTOR (V.O.) So what's the prognosis? 
INT. VON DOOM INDUSTRIES - VICTOR'S OFFICE - DAY 
CLOSE ON: an X-RAY.  Victor's ARM.  The metallic transformation is higher now.  PULL BACK TO REVEAL: Victor and his DOCTOR.  In the wall behind them: ancient armor (maybe we noticed it before, maybe not).  It adds a little menace to the room. 
DOCTOR Your tissue, your organs, your entire biophysical structure is changing. Every system is still functioning, somehow -- 
VICTOR And they're changing into... 
DOCTOR I don't really know.  A compound organic-metallic alloy.  Stronger than titanium or carbon steel.  Harder than diamonds -- 
VICTOR Like the shields Reed said would protect us. (cold fury, deadly focus) How long? 
DOCTOR At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks -- 
VICTOR What do you mean "complete"? 
DOCTOR I wish I could tell you.  I can't pretend to know what we're dealing with here.  I'll notify the CDC and -- 
Victor hardens, razor sharp. 
VICTOR What? 
DOCTOR The Center for Disease Control.  If this thing is contagious -- 
WHHM!  Victor GRABS the Doctor by the throat. 
VICTOR Look at me.  I have a life.  I'm the face of a billion-dollar-company... We need to keep this confidential, understand? 
Victor's grip TIGHTENS around the man's throat. 
DOCTOR But...this disease...is progressive... degenerative... 
VICTOR That's terrible news... 
With one cobra-swift move, Victor thrusts his metallic arm into the doctor, killing him instantly.  Victor retracts his arm, and looks at it, shocked by his own strength. 
VICTOR (CONT'D) ...but I think I'll get a second opinion. 
INT. BAXTER BUILDING - REED'S OFFICE - NIGHT 
A SERIES OF TIME-LAPSE SHOTS: REED works around the Baxter Building, spending hours searching for the cure.  He checks charts, writes equations, paces, frustrated. 
JOHNNY Hey, Ronnie Renner!  I'm a big fan. 
Ronnie gives a tight nod.  He doesn't like being upstaged by this circus freak. 
The other bikers approach. 
KENNY BARTRAM Heard you like to ride.  Wanna take her for a spin? 
He motions to his BIKE.  Johnny eyes this mean machine. 
RONNIE RENNER Come on, bro.  I'll teach you some tricks...if you can keep up. 
We PUSH IN on Johnny, his ego getting stoked, as we CUT TO -- 
INT. NYC ARENA - TRACK - DAY 
Ronnie jams down the track, kicking dirt back at Johnny. Johnny now wears a MOTOCROSS OUTFIT over his uniform, with the number "004" on the back and a small 4 over his heart. Ronnie hits the first hill, and CATCHES AIR, FLIPPING HIGH! 
X GAMES ANNOUNCER A rock-solid double-flip! 
The CROWD goes wild.  Now it's Johnny's turn.  He hits the hill and pulls the exact same move.  With even more height! 
X GAMES ANNOUNCER (CONT'D) Look at that lift, ladies and gentlemen! 
Johnny sticks the landing.  The crowd swells.  Ronnie tightens, pulls his throttle harder, taking the next jump, and...MAKING AN INSANE MOVE, CORKSCREWING IN THE AIR! 
X GAMES ANNOUNCER (CONT'D) Frontside 360!  He's totally flat and whipped! 
He lands clean.  The crowd is ready to explode.  Johnny REVS his engine, his body starting to STEAM, adrenaline burning. He hits the hill, and pulls an even gnarlier SPIN! 
X GAMES ANNOUNCER (CONT'D) Whoa!  That's a...what is that?  A 
Johnny lands.  The crowd roars.  Ronnie bears down on the last hill.  He leans over his handlebars. 
X GAMES ANNOUNCER (CONT'D) He's going for a Kiss of Death! 
Ronnie hits the hill, pulls this JAW-DROPPING DEATH-DEFYING STUNT!  The crowd is deafening!  Ronnie smiles.  And... 
JOHNNY SPEEDS FASTER, FASTER.  Trails of FLAME start to streak off his back!  He RACES LIKE A ROCKET UP THE HILL! LAUNCHING TO IMPOSSIBLE HEIGHTS!  SPINNING LIKE A TOP!  A FLAMING BLUR! 
And now for the really impressive part: Johnny's bike starts to drop, but JOHNNY KEEPS RISING!  He FLAMES ON, spiraling upward!  For a few seconds, he's actually...almost...flying. 
X GAMES ANNOUNCER (CONT'D) (hand over mic) Is he......flying? 
A beat.  Time suspended.  And...WHHM!  He PLUMMETS back down! LANDS on his bike in mid-air!  And sticks a perfect landing, maybe even kicking a little dirt up at Ronnie.  Johnny swerves to a stop, with a "holy shit" look on his face.  What the hell just happened?? 
X GAMES ANNOUNCER (CONT'D) Unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen! You've just seen the first...the first...TORCHFLIGHT!  The McTORCH! 
A new name is born.  The crowd goes berserk.  Standing ovation.  Riders rush up to Johnny.  Kenny sees his bike: 
THE SEAT MELTED, WHEELS BURNED OFF.  Johnny smiles. 
JOHNNY My bad.  Sorry about that. (a glance to Ronnie) Thanks for the lesson, bro. 
HOT GIRLS swarm.  As Johnny gets swallowed by fans, we see a scary thing flicker in his eyes: the birth of a star. 
INT. BAXTER BUILDING - KITCHEN - MORNING 
Sue stands alone, sifting through piles of mail.  She focuses on one piece of mail that she's holding.  Her hand begins to disappear and then the envelope slowly begins to disappear as well.  Sue smiles at the success.  Intrigued.  Quiet: 
SUE That's new... 
Reed enters -- overworked, unshaved.  He keeps his head down, preoccupied.  Sue shifts focus. 
SUE (CONT'D) Have you read these...?  From all over.  People want us to fight crimes... save their kids...solve their problems... (no response from Reed) ...when we can't even solve our own. 
She puts the letters down, steps closer to Reed. 
SUE (CONT'D) Reed.  How close are we to a cure? 
REED No way to know.  Without more tests, experiments. 
She considers.  Victor's words echo in her head. 
SUE We're not specimens, we're patients. This isn't just another science project to you, is it...? 
Reed looks up, a little surprised.  He opens his mouth, but -- 
BEN (O.S.) NO...NO...NO FREAKIN' WAY!! 
INT. BAXTER BUILDING - MEDIA ROOM - DAY 
CRASH!  BANG!  Ben stalks around the room, furious.  Reed and Sue rush in. 
REED BEN!  What?  What's going on!? 
Ben points to the wall-sized TV: the ESPN MOTO X GAMES. 
X GAMES REPORTER (ON TV) So what can you tell us about the outfit? 
REVEAL: JOHNNY standing next to an X GAMES REPORTER.  He is peeling off the burned remains of his motocross outfit, revealing his FF UNIFORM, with a "4" STITCHED ONTO THE CHEST. 
Behind them, STEP UP RIDERS launch their MOTO-BIKES off huge 18' high mountains of dirt, thirty feet in the air. 
JOHNNY (ON TV) Not too much, but I will say that it's all weather and no leather.  Kind of Armani meets Astronaut. 
Ben reels back a FIST the size of an anvil.  Stops himself. Instead of attacking, he starts to walk off. 
Johnny hurls a FIREBALL that SMACKS Ben in the back of the head.  Ben stops.  Turns around more shocked than hurt. 
BEN Did you just -- 
Ben gets hit with ANOTHER FIREBALL.  This time in the face. 
BEN (CONT'D) Okay, that's it, tinkerbell!  You want to fly?  Fly. 
Ben charges like a bull, fist cocked back, and...Reed steps in the way!  Too late!  WHAMM!  Ben's fist PUNCHES INTO REED'S CHEST, which INDENTS.  Reed's BACK EXPANDS with Ben's fist, PUNCHING into Johnny, launching Johnny off his feet. 
BAM!  Johnny SLAMS into a moving ADVERTISING TRUCK, with a BURGER KING flame-broiled WHOPPER on the side.  WHOOSH!  He leaves a flaming imprint on the all-beef patty. 
The crowd stands stunned.  So do Reed and Sue.  Cameras pop. 
Johnny slowly pulls himself up.  The paint on the truck begins to bubble around his hand.  Beaten, bruised, he stands.  Heating up.  Both his hands are now flaming fists of fury. 
JOHNNY Let's see if we can get blood from a stone. 
He and Ben lock eyes, with a block of sidewalk between them. High Noon.  They start to RUN toward each other... 
When they are almost within range, Sue STEPS BETWEEN THEM, stops them both in their tracks with just a look.  Like a mom: 
SUE You two need a time-out. 
JOHNNY Blockhead started it! 
Ben just stalks off.  The crowd clears, scared.  A PAPARAZZI snaps a picture.  Ben GRABS his camera, and flicks the lens. 
EXT. STREETS - DAY 
Sue looks at Johnny, more disappointed than angry. 
SUE Damn it, Johnny. 
She goes after Ben, leaving Reed and Johnny on the sidewalk. 
REED You need to control yourself and think before you -- 
JOHNNY Act.  Here we go again.  Reed, what if we got these gifts for a reason?  What if we have some, you know...like, calling? 
REED A higher calling like getting girls and making money? 
Johnny nods, totally missing the sarcasm. 
JOHNNY Is there any higher? 
Reed looks at him, disgusted.  Johnny waves to the crowd, hand flaming.  People SHRIEK, snap pictures.  Johnny smiles at Reed. 
JOHNNY (CONT'D) This is who we are Reed.  Accept it. Or better yet: enjoy it. 
Johnny steps into the sea of fans.  Reed stands alone. 
EXT. STREET/ALLEY - DAY 
Sue wades through the throng of New Yorkers.  Tries to catch up with Ben...whose presence parts the crowd like Moses. 
SUE Ben!  Slow down... 
Ben glances sideways at her, doesn't stop.  She catches up. 
SUE (CONT'D) He didn't mean it.  You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead -- 
BEN It's not him.  It's them. (pointing to crowd) I can't live like this. 
SUE Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one -- 
BEN It's easy for you to be patient. 
SUE No, it's not.  I thought I was done waiting for Reed... We're all in this together now, Ben. 
He slows down, gets closer, intense. 
BEN Together?  Look at me, Susie.  You got no idea what I'd give...to be invisible.  Your nightmare...is my dream. 
She opens her mouth, but has no response.  She doesn't know his depth of pain.  As he disappears into the alley, we CUT TO -- 
INT. INVESTMENT BANK - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 
The news plays on the TV.  Head Banker Ned Cecil freezes the screen on an image of...THE THING.  He turns to Victor, who sits with the rest of the bankers.  Cold, sterile environment. 
NED CECIL This is how you "turn things around"? These freaks are on the front page and your company's in the obituaries. 
Victor has a larger bandage on his face now. 
VICTOR I have a plan to use their publicity for -- 
NED CECIL Victor, stop.  The bank's lost enough already.  This isn't a negotiation. It's a notification.  We're pulling out. 
A cold, silent beat.  Victor leans forward. 
VICTOR You need to look long-term here. Without risk, there's no -- 
NED CECIL Reward.  We all know the sales pitch, Vic.  And frankly, we're done buying... Gentlemen. 
REED The storm needs to be handled exactly right, or it could make our mutations worse, much worse, maybe even kill us... 
Victor slows.  Is Reed getting to him?  Or giving him ideas? 
REED (CONT'D) Victor, please.  We need time to verify the data... We can't afford any mistakes -- there's only enough ions for two or three attempts. 
Victor considers.  He seems to enjoy watching Reed dangle. 
VICTOR Reed.  I'm not asking permission. (a final verdict) We'll build it, while you check the specs. 
Victor walks out.  Reed looks unsure, as we CUT TO -- 
INT. BAXTER BUILDING TRANSFORMATION LAB - DAY 
The SHIELDS slowly rise.  FIVE TECHNICIANS go to work.  They wear the VDI jackets.  Reed watches, worried. 
Sue enters.  She sees the shields, the technicians, the VDI logo.  And she is deeply worried.  She steps over to Reed. Sparks fly behind them.  Drills scream. 
SUE Can I talk to you? 
INT. BAXTER BUILDING - REED'S OFFICE - DAY 
Sue steps into the office, followed by Reed.  Quiet, urgent: 
SUE Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake -- 
REED He was going to take away all my data, equipment -- 
SUE Better than your life.  Victor's not the one who has to get into that thing.  We are. 
Reed starts to snap, losing his studied cool. 
REED Which is why I'm working twenty hours a day, checking every variable -- 
SUE Every variable but yourself.  You don't eat, sleep.  You can't live in your head like -- 
REED (finally losing it) I'm not the only one in there.  I got you, Vic, Ben, Johnny, all rattling around in there. 
Sue stands there, shocked by his outburst.  A beat. 
SUE So clear it out.  Get out of your head.  Get out of here... 
He looks at her, knowing what she means.  Where she means. 
EXT. BROOKLYN STREETS - DAY 
Ben nearly knocks people over as he stomps down the street, mind tossing and turning.  People stare, point.  A LITTLE GIRL and FRIEND run up to him. 
LITTLE GIRL Mister, Mister!  Please help me!  My kitty is stuck in a tree. 
She gestures to a tree next to Ben.  Looks up. 
LITTLE GIRL (CONT'D) Please save Miss Lucy. 
Ben rolls his eyes.  Looks up.  Considers climbing the tree, but thinks better of it.  He has another idea... 
Ben grabs the tree with one hand, and starts shaking the crap out of it.  MEEEEEEOOOOOOOWWWWRRRRRRR!!!! 
The cat falls into frame.  At the last instant, Ben sticks out his hand and the cat lands safely in his palm.  He hands the cat to the girl.  Barely acknowledges her profuse thanks. He just moves on. 
EXT. ANOTHER BROOKLYN STREET - NIGHT 
Ben passes a window in a gallery, and almost misses A LARGE SCULPTURE of his bust. 
He stops, steps back to take a look.  It's exquisitely rendered, capturing not just brute physicality, but the haunting anguish in his eyes.  Ben is amazed, and touched, but... 
BEN (under breath) Eyebrows are a little big... 
A beat.  He stares at these images of himself. 
VOICE (O.S.) I figured the only way to get you here was to stick that in the window. 
He turns to see...ALICIA in the doorway. 
BEN How'd you know it was me? 
ALICIA I'm blind, not deaf.  Wanna come in? 
He steps toward her.  But he sees...a PARTY in the back part of the gallery.  Ben pauses, a little insecure. 
BEN I'm not really dressed for a party. 
ALICIA Relax, it's casual. 
BEN No, I mean...I'm a little...dusty... 
She smiles, a thought forming, as we CUT TO -- 
INT. GALLERY - STUDIO - NIGHT 
WHOOSH!  A SCULPTOR'S HOSE sprays a thin stream of water at BEN.  Alicia cleans Ben with her hands, using thin CARVING CHISELS for his cracks.  Intricate, intimate work. 
Ben enjoys every moment.  He eyes a couple, large PUPPETS in the corner. 
BEN Those yours too? 
She knows.  He trails off.  Sue looks at him. 
REED (CONT'D) You always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you...speak his mind.  One who wasn't afraid to tell you what he wanted. 
SUE I did.  I did, Reed...but I wanted you to be that man. 
Someone SHUSHES them.  They slump down further.  Closer. 
SUE (CONT'D) When I walked out, I waited ten minutes outside your door.  Ten. Waiting for you to come find me. 
REED Why didn't you say something? 
SUE That would have kinda defeated the purpose.  And Reed... (closer, emotional) I'm saying it now. 
Their eyes lock.  A heated beat.  No more secrets.  Their faces are close.  A kiss is coming.  Closer, closer.  Sue disappears. 
SUE (CONT'D) (quiet, playful) Come find me. 
Reed tentatively leans into the kiss, and... 
SUE (O.S.) (CONT'D) That's my nose, genius... These are my lips. 
Reed's face is SQUEEZED on both sides by Sue's invisible hands.  She pulls him into a KISS.  Lips touch.  Soft, tender.  Stars twinkle.  And we slowly DISSOLVE TO -- 
EXT. KIRBY GALLERY - NIGHT 
Ben and Alicia step out together.  The crowd quiets, turns. A few whispers flutter.  Alicia leans close to Ben, and slips her arm into his.  The party goes back to normal. 
ALICIA Look around.  I'll get us drinks. They always let blind girls cut the line. 
She walks off.  He watches her go.  The way her hair moves. The lines of her neck.  The light on her skin.  This woman is the most beautiful thing Ben has ever seen.  He's falling hard. 
Ben steps through the crowd.  The swanky guests give strained smiles, polite.  Ben is starting to feel comfortable here. He keeps his eyes on Alicia, who talks to guests. 
Ben hangs back, happy to watch her.  A few patrons pass him, thinking he's just an inanimate statue. 
PATRON I don't know about this one.  It lacks a certain...realism. 
Ben keeps his eyes on Alicia.  He overhears two BOHEMIAN GIRLS, who assume he's a statue. 
BOHEMIAN GIRL #1 She's always had a thing for runaways and strays, but this is ridiculous. 
BOHEMIAN GIRL #2 I know.  Did she really think these sculptures would sell? 
BOHEMIAN GIRL #1 Like anybody would want this thing in their house.  That girl's a one-woman charity. 
Ben just stands there, frozen.  His eyes dart around the room, paranoid now.  Aware of people staring, laughing.  He glances at Alicia, who giggles at something else.  Ten seconds ago, this would have been dreamy.  Now it's damning. 
We stay with Alicia, who cuts through the crowd, emerging where she left Ben.  She has a PITCHER of wine in hand for him.  But Ben is gone.  She looks disappointed, hearing his heavy FOOTSTEPS get softer and softer in the distance. 
THUNDER booms on the CUT TO -- 
EXT./INT. DINER - NIGHT 
A pitstop in Queens.  Heavy RAIN swims down windows.  BEN sits at the COUNTER, with his hat pulled low, coat tight. Nobody sits within four chairs of him.  He sips coffee in a metal bowl.  A long beat.  Then... 
VICTOR (O.S.) This seat taken? 
Ben turns to see...VICTOR. 
BEN What are you doing here? 
VICTOR I'm worried about you. 
BEN About me?  How sweet. 
VICTOR Come on.  Let me buy you something to eat.  Looks like you could use the company. 
Ben considers.  A man deeply alone.  A beat. 
INT. DINER - LATER 
Victor and Ben sit in a window booth.  A waitress sets a foothigh stack of pancakes in front of Ben, removes huge plates he's just cleared.  Victor's aware of the other customers in the diner staring at Ben.  Ben burps: it rattles the plates. 
THE THING 'Scuse me. 
VICTOR I know it can't be easy.  Life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny.  At least they can go out in public.  But for you?  People staring. Whispering behind your back... 
THE THING If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job -- 
VICTOR I'm just saying, I know what it's like to lose something you love.  To see it slip away, and know it's never coming back. 
The Thing shoves a huge piece of pie in his mouth. 
THE THING Reed's gonna fix me up -- 
VICTOR For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical. 
THE THING Skeptical...? 
Ben doesn't trust him.  But Victor is hitting pressure points. 
VICTOR Look, he's a brilliant man, we should trust he's working as hard as he can. You're his best friend.  So what possible reason could he have for taking his time? (a beat) I mean, other than getting close to Sue? 
Off The Thing: a seed of doubt has been planted.  He can't help but find truth in the words.  And we CUT TO -- 
SUE Johnny, slow down.  Think.  You know mom didn't raise us to -- 
JOHNNY Look around, sis!  She's not here.  So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy -- 
SUE As soon as you stop acting like one. Come on, you're smarter than this. You think those people out there care about you?  You're just a fad to them. 
He pulls away from her, taking a step out the door. 
JOHNNY Let's try something new: you live your life.  And I'll live mine. (beat) And just for the record: they LOVE me. 
He strides into the night, leaving Sue alone.  A dark night. The Fantastic Four is no more.  The family is split apart. 
INT. BAXTER BUILDING - TRANSFORMATION LAB - NIGHT 
The transformation chamber is up and running.  Numbers count down.  The storm swirls in the chamber.  Reed now wears the UNIFORM.  He opens the door: 
HE'S GOING TO USE IT ON HIMSELF.  HE IS FINALLY TAKING ACTION. 
INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT 
Victor sits enthralled.  He leans forward, breathless. 
INT. BAXTER BUILDING - TRANSFORMATION LAB - NIGHT 
Reed gets closer.  His heart races.  So does Victor's.  A moment of truth for both of them.  REED STEPS INTO THE MACHINE. 
Reed looks up at the cosmic storm.  He opens his arms, ready to risk his life.  And...WHHHM!  He JOLTS in JUMP-CUT-MOTION, RECONFIGURING, JERKING out of control, and we CUT TO -- 
VICTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT 
His screens GO BLACK.  He looks out the window to see...a flash atop the BAXTER BUILDING.  The tip of the Baxter glows. The rest of its lights GO OUT, FLICKERING in a power surge. 
INT. BAXTER BUILDING - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT 
Lights go haywire.  Sue knows immediately... 
SUE Oh god, Reed. 
INT. BAXTER BUILDING - TRANSFORMATION LAB - NIGHT 
Lights flicker in darkness.  The door rips open.  Sue lunges inside.  She sees through smoke and sparks...REED sways in the chamber.  A beat.  Did it work?  Then... 
Reed SLUMPS TO THE GROUND.  His eyes flutter back.  Dead...? His body is warped, twisted -- one half remains tense, hard, while the other half is loose, soft, almost melted. 
SUE What did you do, Reed?  What did you do? 
INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT 
Victor watches every second on his monitors. 
INT. BAXTER BUILDING - TRANSFORMATION LAB - NIGHT 
Sue struggles to lift Reed -- half of his body is STRETCHED OUT, devoid of any semblance of bone structure.  One side of his face looks like it's MELTING OFF. 
REED I can...make it work. 
SUE Reed, stop, you need to rest your -- 
REED The power...I need...more power...to control...the storm -- 
SUE You need a doctor. 
Reed loses consciousness.  Sue carries him out. 
INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT 
Victor watches, his eyes narrow, looking at his hands. 
VICTOR More power...? 
He reaches out for his phone, and...his SPEAKERPHONE AUTOMATICALLY TURNS ON.  His powers growing. 
VICTOR (TO PHONE) (CONT'D) Leonard.  Bring me our lab rat. 
EXT. UNDER THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE - NIGHT 
Ben sits alone, looking at city lights.  A man without a home.  Without a family.  A hard beat.  HEADLIGHTS slash across Ben.  He slowly turns, blinded in the lights of...a LIMO. 
LEONARD Ben!  They need you back at the Baxter building.  It's...Reed. 
Ben considers.  Despite it all, he's a good friend.  And a good man.  As he gets into the car, we hear THROBBING MUSIC IN -- 
INT. MANHATTAN NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT 
LOUD MUSIC and PULSATING LIGHTS.  A young crowd dances and grinds to the beat.  Among the colorful lights, STREAKS OF FLAME swirl around the ceiling.  We follow them to: 
A BALCONY, where we see JOHNNY sitting in a cozy VIP section. He's surrounded by "groupies" climbing over each other to get a look at his various parlour tricks. 
He leans closer to a YOUNG WOMAN.  Closer.  Candles around them start to melt.  Beads of sweat drip down her face. 
JOHNNY What do you say we get out of here? 
She pauses.  And...a very LARGE MAN steps up. 
JOHNNY (CONT'D) This your boyfriend? 
Sue shakes her head, sympathetic. 
SUE Ben, you got what we all wanted. You need to stay here.  It's too dangerous. 
She heads off.  Ben watches her go, helpless. 
INT. BAXTER BUILDING - REVERSION LAB - NIGHT 
Ben steps back into this ravaged room.  Through the shattered window, he sees Johnny's FLAMES streaking away.  A hard beat. 
BEN What...what have I done? 
EXT. NEW YORK - NIGHT 
Johnny zigs and zags, but the missile takes every twist and turn, gaining on him, bearing down.  Cars slow, stop.  More people look up, scared, pointing at this stunning sight. 
INT. VON DOOM CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT 
Eerily silent.  Reed tries to move, but he is FROZEN.  He hears a footstep.  But the room is EMPTY.  No sign of Doom even.  A beat.  He hears a CREAK.  Another CREAK, closer. And... 
A FREEZING TUBE starts to SHIFT.  It goes taut, clearly being manipulated by a hand -- an INVISIBLE HAND.  Sue APPEARS next to Reed, tube in hand.  She tries to stay calm. 
SUE What has he done to you? 
Reed's eyes shift to see...Doom emerge from the darkness. 
DOOM (O.S.) How romantic. 
SUE Victor, please -- 
DOOM It's Doctor Doom to you. 
He steps closer.  Electrodes course over his metal skin. 
SUE We know the machine works.  It worked on Ben, it'll work on you.  We can turn you back -- 
DOOM Do you really think fate turned us into gods so we could refuse these gifts? 
She hardens, a little force field starts to emanate from her. 
SUE Victor.  You always thought you were god. 
Doom has a hand behind his back, generating an energy blast. 
DOOM Sue please, let's not fight. 
SUE No, Victor... Let's. 
She HURLS a force-field at him.  It CONNECTS, KNOCKING him back a half-step.  But he simply shakes it off, and steps up. Too powerful.  He smiles.  His arms CRACKLE with electricity. 
DOOM Susan...... You're fired. 
BOOM!  He FIRES an ELECTRIC SHOCKWAVE that LAUNCHES her back. She spirals through the air, crashing into the wall, THUDDING to the floor.  As Doom stalks closer, Sue gathers her strength to...GO INVISIBLE. 
DOOM (CONT'D) Marco... 
A hanging beat.  We see: a FAINT OUTLINE of Sue behind him. 
DOOM (CONT'D) Polo. 
He SPINS, GRABS her!  Doom grips her neck, SLAMMING her to the ground beside Reed.  She lays there, beaten, visible. 
In the distance behind Doom, city lights BLINK, fading in and out.  Lights flutter softly here (like when Ben went through the machine).  Reed looks up.  Could it be...? 
EXT. EAST RIVER - NIGHT 
Johnny jets over the water with the missile only twenty feet behind him.  He's running out of options, when he spots: 
A GARBAGE BARGE floating in the water ahead.  Thinking fast, Johnny does a fly-by and HURLS a fireball at the barge. VWOOSH!  The flames ignite and spread quickly. 
He loops back toward the flaming barge as the missile closes in on him.  Fifteen feet...ten... Just as it's about to hit -- 
JOHNNY FLAMES OFF and falls toward the water.  As he tumbles through the air, we CUT BACK TO -- 
INT. VON DOOM CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT 
From their vantage point, they see the missile explode. Flames dance. Sue's eyes darken, as Doom grips her neck. 
Reed tries desperately to move, but he is FROZEN.  It takes every last ounce of strength to lift one finger, which makes a CRACCCKKKKING sound. 
DOOM One more down.  Now it's just the scientist and his specimen. 
Sue and Reed lock eyes.  Reed tries to move his mouth.  He has something to tell her, struggling just to move his lips and get the words out. 
REED Sue.  The only thing I ever knew without thinking was... (his lips fully freezing) I...love... 
He starts to say "you," but his lips FREEZE, mid-word.  Sue whispers to him: 
SUE Me too, Reed. 
Doom steps toward Sue, about to deliver the final blow. 
DOOM (quiet, cruel) And so four became none.  It's my time now. 
BOOOOM!  An elevator DOOR FLIES INTO THE ROOM!  SMASH! 
DOOM (CONT'D) Hello Susan. 
She turns VISIBLE, holding back the pole with a FORCEFIELD. Using her power, she FLINGS the pole from Doom's grip.  It skids along the street.  Reed helps Ben to his feet. 
Doom turns to these three wounded soldiers. 
DOOM (CONT'D) What is this?  The pitiful three? 
Doom steps toward them, but -- 
VOICE (O.S.) Four. 
WHOOOSH!  Johnny SWOOPS DOWN, hurling a FIREBALL like a flamethrower, KNOCKING Doom back. 
Johnny takes his place alongside the others.  The four of them stand as one.  Johnny turns to Thing. 
JOHNNY Had a little relapse, huh? 
Thing starts to retort, but Johnny gives a warm smile. 
JOHNNY (CONT'D) Welcome back. 
They turn to Doom, who stands with metal skin slightly singed and melted, making him look all the more menacing. 
DOOM This is going to be fun. 
Electricity starts to course through his body.  He stands at the foot of the crater Ben made.  He THRUSTS down, grabbing a thick POWER CABLE, RIPPING it out of the street! 
He SNAPS the cable into two snaking, lashing strips.  He holds tight, ABSORBING the power.  Lights FLICKER and DIM in buildings around him.  Windows BLOW!  Doom GLOWS, amped up. 
He LETS GO of the cables!  The two deadly wires SNAKE out of control!  PEDESTRIANS scatter, panic.  Reed sees the wires SLASHING through the air.  He makes a move: 
Reed STREEETCHES HIS ARMS, reaching for the deadly cables. 
Doom FIRES superpowered ENERGY BOLTS.  The electric charges surge through the air toward the Fantastic Four, but -- 
Sue TOSSES her FORCE-FIELDS, exploding Doom's blasts in mid- flight.  She keeps her hands up, BLOCKING blows like a prize fighter.  One of Doom's BOLTS glances off her force-field and -- 
SMASHES into a concrete stanchion of a BUILDING!  The pillar starts to crumble, with PEOPLE huddled under the overhang! They're about to be CRUSHED by the falling concrete!  But -- 
Suddenly, the concrete roof HOLDS STEADY...because...BEN is holding it up!  He stands beside the stanchion, like Atlas holding the world.  People run out, safe. 
ON THE STREET: Reed finally grabs both ends of the wire. 
REED JOHNNY!  SPOT-WELD! 
Johnny FLIES toward him, and uses his flames to WELD the wires back together.  Sparks fly.  The cables start to FUSE. 
Doom keeps FIRING.  Sue struggles with her force-fields.  The impact is too much.  Her nose starts to bleed. 
SUE Can't...hold...on... 
Doom smiles.  Reed sees her.  She is about to drop her hands, vulnerable, but..............REED STRETCHES HIS WHOLE BODY! 
He EXPANDS himself across the street, and GRABS a TREE, so he forms a WALL between Sue and Doom. 
Doom keeps FIRING his bolts.  They SLAM into Reed's body, RUBBERBAND his skin, and DISTEND OUT his back without breaking.  He strains, agonizing. 
REED Johnny.  SUPERNOVA. 
JOHNNY But all these people... 
REED Now. 
Johnny charges toward Doom -- flames on his body starting build to a blinding white intensity, ENGULFING everything. Johnny GRABS DOOM. 
THING (quiet, smiling) Flame on, kid. 
FLASH!  Johnny explodes in a PULSE of BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT, which starts to HEAT UP everything surrounding it.  Reed doesn't miss a beat.  He's in total command now. 
REED Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, frustration -- 
SUE (looking at Doom) I'm sure I can come up with something. 
She concentrates.  She sees Johnny holding onto Doom -- and the GROWING HEAT and LIGHT. 
Sue shuts her eyes.  A GIANT FORCE FIELD EXPLODES FROM HER BODY.  A massive WAVE OF ENERGY.  It SWOOPS past a car, which WARPS, MELTS (half the car is not inside the force-field). 
Thing turns to the crowd, extending his arm, blocking them. Sue's force-field ENVELOPS JOHNNY'S SUPERNOVA, containing it in a BRIGHT SPHERE OF ENERGY.  The light increases, to the point that it's blinding.  People look away. 
Finally, Johnny's supernova fades.  He collapses to the ground, exhausted, smoking.  Sue exhales and falls to her knees.  Her force field fades.  The light flickers out.  As everyone's eyes adjust, we hear...THUD.  THUD.  And -- 
DOOM steps through the smoke.  Unharmed.  His metallic body GLOWS WHITE, TRAILING MOLTEN METAL.  Sue, Ben, Johnny look devastated.  They can't beat him.  He looks at Reed. 
DOOM Is that the best you can do...?  A little heat...? 
Reed stays perfectly calm.  He shakes his head. 
REED Time for your lesson, Vic.  Chem 101: what happens when you supercool hot metal...? (to Ben) Ben... 
BEN Got it, teach. 
He KICKS OPEN the FIRE HYDRANT.  The water GEYSERS UP!  Ben kicks down with his foot, deflecting the water so it sprays toward Reed, who...TWISTS HIS TORSO so... 
The water CURLS around his chest, RACES down his arms, and SHOOTS right off his wrists toward Doom!

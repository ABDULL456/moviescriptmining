NOTE: THE HARD COPY OF THIS SCRIPT CONTAINED SCENE NUMBERS AND SOME "SCENE OMITTED" SLUGS. THEY HAVE BEEN REMOVED FOR THIS SOFT COPY. 
INT. JIM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
PAN across details in a bedroom...we see discarded shirts...pants...socks...and hear 
PORNO-CHANNEL CHICK (V.O.) Oooh, yeah.  Oh, baby, you're so good. 
JIM (O.S.) Yeah, I'm the best, baby. 
Now we see a TV...but the picture isn't clear.  Or, more appropriately, the picture is scrambled -- it phases in and out.  Bars scroll across it.  And we get occasional glimpses of what looks like -- 
JIM (O.S.)(CONT'D) ...oh -- that was a tit, tits... 
As most high-school guys know (but few will admit), it is possible to watch the pay channels while they're scrambled.  You just need a decent imagination to fill in the rest of the picture.  We PULL BACK to see JIM -- 17, short, horny. 
PORNO-CHANNEL CHICK (V.O.) Give it to me!  Yes! 
JIM Oh yeah, baby, I'll give it to you. 
Jim is, uh, physically involved with the scrambled babe. We TILT DOWN to see a small multimedia presentation next to Jim on his bed.  "Cosmopolitan" is open to a sexy model...a yearbook is open to the "girl's swim team" section...and a dictionary next to Jim, open to the "Vagina" listing, accompanied by a big vagina diagram. 
PORNO-CHANNEL CHICK (V.O.) Don't you love my sexy body?! 
JIM I do, baby, I do. 
He frantically looks around...and grabs a tube sock off the floor. 
PORNO-CHANNEL CHICK (V.O.) You're so big! 
JIM Yeah, that's right. 
PORNO-CHANNEL STUD (V.O.) (deep macho voice) Ohhh, tell me you're a nasty girl! 
Jim is thrown off. 
PORNO-CHANNEL STUD (V.O.)(CONT'D) Yeahhh, you been bad, real bad! 
JIM Man, shut up! 
Suddenly there's a KNOCK at the door, immediately after which JIM'S MOM enters.  Jim scrambles and quickly covers himself and the dictionary with a pillow.  She's oblivious to his doings. 
JIM'S MOM Hey, Jimmy.  I just wanted to say sweet dreams. 
JIM Yep, okay Mom, 'night. 
JIM'S MOM (leans in to Jim) Kiss goodnight. 
Jim is revolted.  Very reluctantly he gives her a kiss. She turns to leave, and notices the TV. 
JIM'S MOM (CONT'D) Is something wrong with the reception? 
JIM Yeah.  Damn cable.  There's this nature show that I'm trying to watch. 
PORNO-CHANNEL CHICK (V.O.) Fuck me!  Yes! 
JIM Uh... 
He hurriedly tries to change the channel with the REMOTE, but instead the VOLUME GOES UP. 
PORNO-CHANNEL CHICK (V.O.) BLOW YOUR WAD ON MY TITS!! 
Jim panics as his mom reacts, shocked. 
JIM (choking) Must...be...broken... 
JIM'S DAD enters. 
JIM'S DAD What the heck is this? 
JIM Nothing! 
JIM'S MOM I think he's trying to watch one of the illegal channels. 
JIM Jesus, Mom!  They're not illegal! They're pay channels.  How could a television channel be illegal?!  God, get a clue! 
JIM'S DAD James, don't speak that way to your mother! 
The Band Dorks LAUGH and agree, "hilariously" attempting to play their instruments from the wrong end.  The guys shudder. 
OZ (to Jim) You guys got the Latin homework? 
JIM No -- Kevin, you? 
KEVIN (offended) Please. (then) We're all golden, we're college bound. I figured it out -- I can get a c- minus in every class, and it's not gonna make a difference.  U of M, here I come. 
INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - MAIN HALL NEAR POP MACHINE - DAY 
Vicky is talking with JESSICA, a friend of hers, getting a pop (we're in the Midwest now, gang) from the machine. 
VICKY Vanderbilt's not that far from U of M. 
JESSICA Yeah right. 
VICKY What?  We both have cars. 
JESSICA Yeah but, no offense, you're talking about a post-high school, long- distance relationship, and you and Kevin haven't even done it yet. 
VICKY That's not why we're going out. 
JESSICA What the hell are you expecting him to drive to Vanderbilt for?  Milk and cookies? 
VICKY Jessica!  He'll drive there for me, and I'll drive to Ann Arbor for him. We're going to have sex when he's ready and I'm ready.  It's got to be completely perfect.  I want the right place, the right time, the right moment. 
JESSICA Vicky, it's not a space shuttle launch, it's sex.  So did you do the physics write-up? 
VICKY (offended, a la Kevin) Please. 
INT. EAST GREAT FALLS - SENIOR LOCKERS - DAY 
Kevin, Jim, and Oz are still walking down the hall. PAUL FINCH, preppy, eccentric, is sitting on a bench. 
JIM There's our man. 
KEVIN Finch, you got the Latin homework? 
FINCH Non habeo.  Canis meus id comedit. 
The guys keep staring.  A beat. 
KEVIN Whatever. 
Someone is HOLLERING down the hall.  Running towards Oz is STEVE STIFLER -- very clean-cut and preppy, he's a maniac, a jackass, much worse than Oz.  Not really part of the group. 
STIFLER (yelling) NOVA!! 
OZ Stifler!! 
Stifler runs full-force into Oz, grabbing him in a bear hug. 
STIFLER You coming to party tonight, Ostreicher, ya fuckface? 
OZ Depends if my date wants to stop by. 
STIFLER That junior chick? 
OZ Nah, gave her the Heisman.  I'm working on something new. 
STIFLER Yeah right.  I got an idea for something new.  How 'bout you guys actually locate your dicks, remove the shrink wrap, and fuckin' use 'em. 
OZ Dude, it's gotta happen -- she's a college chick! 
STIFLER Bullshit.  From where? 
OZ She works part-time at my dad's store. 
STIFLER Hah!  Yeah, Oz, I bet it's more like your dad works at her store. 
OZ Dude, he does not. 
KEVIN Really, Stifler.  He's the manager. 
Oz gives a little nod, avoiding the issue. 
STIFLER Hey, man, I'm not making fun.  I'm fuckin' impressed.  I mean, "Footlong or six-inch, white or wheat," that's some serious shit to master. 
Oz musters a little LAUGH. 
KEVIN (half-joking) Stifler, you're such an asshole. 
STIFLER Meyers, what's the deal with you and Vicky, anyway?  You've been going out since Homecoming and all she'll do is blow you?  Shit, I'd drop her like a steaming turd. 
FINCH Do you commonly grasp warm pieces of stool? 
STIFLER (momentarily puzzled) I do when I'm throwing them at your mom, you damn freak. (then) Alright then, see you guys tonight. I'll look for you in the No Fucking section. 
KEVIN The difference is so phenomenal, I can't decide. 
EXT. DOG DAYS - MAGIC HOUR - CONTINUING 
They exit the restaurant. 
JIM What about you?  You're the one with the girlfriend and you're still stranded on third base. 
KEVIN You know, I've never got that shit. What exactly constitutes third base? 
OZ (holds up a couple fingers) Contact, dude. 
KEVIN Then where does a blowjob figure in? 
They ponder this for a moment. 
OZ Shortstop.  'Course, you don't make it to third, and you're out. 
JIM So let's say you get there...what's uh, third base feel like? 
KEVIN Oh, man, that's kind of sad. 
Jim shrugs, embarrassed. 
OZ Feels like warm apple pie, dude. 
JIM Apple pie... (then) McDonald's or homemade? 
They just look at him.  Finch hops on his scooter. 
FINCH Gentlemen, see you at the Bacchanalia. 
He MEEPS his horn and buzzes away. 
INT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
For a high-school party, it's pretty good.  The house is peppered with ALL TYPES OF HIGH-SCHOOL STUDENTS.  MUSIC blends with the din of excited conversation. 
Kevin and Jim are drinking beers.  Around them, students mingle and flirt.  CHUCK SHERMAN comes up. 
SHERMAN What's up, fellas? 
JIM Hey Sherman.  Scopin' the babes. 
SHERMAN Indeed.  Some fine ladies here, boys. Confidence is high, repeat, confidence is high. Sherman is moving to DefCon Two, full strategic arsenal ready for deployment. 
JIM You've got something going? 
SHERMAN Did you see that Central chick? Brunette? 
KEVIN/JIM No. 
SHERMAN She's around.  Seems that she's taken a liking to me.  Fellas, it's time that she experienced -- The Sherminator. 
KEVIN Yeah, okay Sherman, whatever. 
SHERMAN I'm a sophisticated sex robot, sent back through time...to change the future for one lucky lady. 
KEVIN Yeah man, right on! 
Sherman saunters off into the party. 
KEVIN (CONT'D) (shakes his head) Hopeless. 
Vicky approaches, having a good time, joining the guys, EXCHANGING GREETINGS.  Jim spots NADIA across the room. She's beautiful, a masterpiece of a woman. 
JIM Oh, shit!  There she is.  Nadia. 
VICKY You like her?  Her sponsor family lives on my block.  Why don't you talk to her? 
JIM What would I say? 
VICKY Just tell her what's on your mind. And smile, you've got a good smile. (then to Kevin) Come on. 
KEVIN (to Jim) Gotta go. 
JIM But -- 
Kevin and Vicky disappear into the crowd -- just as Jim sees Nadia approaching him.  He freaks. 
JIM (cont'd) Kevin, get back here! 
But he's gone.  And Nadia is now in front of him.  With no other alternative, Jim readies himself, smiling big. 
NADIA (with a really sexy accent) You are in my English class, no? 
Jim smiles. 
OZ There's something about the spring that's just cool.  Like the smell of fresh rain or something. 
At this, she snuggles up to him.  Oz smiles confidently. 
OZ (CONT'D) Suck me, beautiful. 
The College Chick backs off, confounded. 
COLLEGE CHICK What did you just say? 
OZ (not so confidently) Suck me...beautiful? 
The College Chick's eyes flutter in disbelief.  She tries to keep her cool -- but can barely restrain her laughter. 
COLLEGE CHICK What?! 
Oz attempts to maintain a suave exterior, but he's just had the rug pulled from under him. 
OZ Uh...you know, my friends call me Nova -- as in Casanova. 
COLLEGE CHICK You need some work, buddy! 
She bursts into laughter.  Oz is ill. 
OZ Well...jeez, don't laugh at me. 
Seeing Oz's defeated expression, she collects herself. 
COLLEGE CHICK Look, Chris.  There are just some things you need to learn, that's all. 
OZ Like what? 
She sees that he's lost.  Almost feels sorry for him. 
COLLEGE CHICK Alright, well...you've got to tone it down.  You don't need to go to Lookout Point and spout cheeseball lines to be romantic. 
OZ ...okay... 
COLLEGE CHICK You have to pay attention to a girl. Be sensitive to her feelings. Relationships are reciprocal. 
OZ I'm not good in math. 
She's trying not to laugh again. 
COLLEGE CHICK Come on, I'll drop you off at your friends'. 
Oz couldn't be humiliated any further. 
INT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT - SAME TIME 
Oz is nursing a beer, having just told the story to Jim, Stifler, and some guys. 
STIFLER (hysterical, toppling over) You actually said that?!  Haaaah!! 
OZ Shut the fuck up. 
JIM Hey, you did better than I did, Nova. 
OZ Oh that's really reassuring.  And don't call me Nova anymore.  I'm a fraud. 
STIFLER This is pathetic.  I'm gonna find me a little hottie. 
Stifler strides into another room. 
STIFLER (O.S.)(cont'd) (yelling) Suck me, beautiful! 
Oz wallows in his beer can, beaten. 
INT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Vicky is pleasuring Kevin...you know. 
VICKY (brief pause) Let me know. 
KEVIN Okay, don't stop. 
She resumes.  A moment more -- and then Kevin is about to lose it. 
KEVIN (cont'd) Oh -- Now! 
With awkward hurriedness, Vicky stops as Kevin frantically searches for a receptacle.  He grabs a nearby cup of beer. 
EXT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - BACK PORCH, BY THE KEG - NIGHT 
Insert -- A hand pumping up the keg.  A fresh beer foams out into the cup. 
GUY #1 There we go. 
Stifler barfs even more violently. 
EXT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - BACK PORCH, BY THE KEG - NIGHT 
Jessica and Vicky are refilling their beers at the keg. Nadia waits patiently beside them with an empty cup. 
VICKY He likes it. 
JESSICA Of course he does.  What about you? Have you just never had one with Kevin -- or have you never had one, period? 
VICKY I think I've had one. 
JESSICA Well that's a no.  No wonder you're not psyched about sex. (starts filling Vicky's beer) You've never even had one manually? 
VICKY ...I've never tried it. 
JESSICA Are you kidding?  You've never double- clicked your mouse? 
Vicky shrugs. 
JESSICA (CONT'D) Hell, just a pair of tight pants will set me off. (noticing Nadia next to them, she passes the tap along) Am I right or what, Nadia? 
NADIA (no bones about it) You are right.  The hands are not always necessary. 
JESSICA (to Vicky) See? 
NADIA In fact -- I should teach you my own special method.  I developed it myself at the ballet institute in Prague. You use nothing but the muscles of the inner thigh. 
Nadia walks off. 
JESSICA No wonder she never pays attention in class. 
Vicky nods, traumatized. 
INT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - LATER 
Kevin and Jim are looking at a PICTURE OF STIFLER'S MOM on the wall.  Very attractive, late 30's. 
JIM Shit, I can't believe a fine woman like this produced a guy like Stifler. 
TWO FRESHMAN GUYS are walking by as Jim says this. 
FRESHMAN GUY Dude!  That chick -- is a MILF! 
FRESHMAN GUY #2 What the hell is that? 
FRESHMAN GUY M-I-L-F!  Mom I'd Like to Fuck! 
Suddenly, a bedroom door opens a couple inches.  Sherman pokes his head out. 
SHERMAN (hushed, to guys) Don't you think you fellas could try a little tact?  I've got company.  Know what I mean? 
In the bedroom in the background, we see the Central Girl.  Sherman closes the door, leaving the guys there, dumbstruck. 
INT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - STAIRWAY - NIGHT 
Jim and Kevin are coming down the stairs. 
KEVIN (snapping) Dammit!  If Sherman has sex before I do, I'm gonna be really fucking pissed. 
They turn the corner into the kitchen. 
INT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUING 
KEVIN Man, I just gotta get laid already! This blowjob thing is bullshit! 
He stops.  Vicky is there with Jessica.  Staring at him. Vicky quietly grabs her purse.  Hurt.  OTHER STUDENTS watch, silently.  Kevin doesn't know what to say. 
VICKY Jessica, can you drive me home? 
JESSICA Sure. 
The guys watch as the girls head for the door. 
KEVIN Vicky, wait. 
VICKY Not for you. 
The girls exit.  Nobody says anything.  Kevin is in shock. 
PARTY GUY (O.S.) Yeti!  I am the Yeti! 
INT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - DAY 
The next morning.  The party is long over.  Plastic beer cups and various bottles litter the house, but it's not trashed. 
Jim is wandering around in a daze, holding his head.  He stumbles over a body.  It's Kevin. 
JESSICA You got it, stud. 
KEVIN Well...I'm pretty sure I've -- 
JESSICA (interrupts authoritatively) No you haven't. 
KEVIN But that one time -- 
JESSICA (shaking head) No. 
KEVIN Well of course I'd want to give her that.  I mean, what do you think, I don't care about her? 
JESSICA Do you? 
KEVIN Of course. 
JESSICA Do you love her? 
Kevin squirms. 
KEVIN I -- I don't know, you can't ask me that. 
JESSICA Well, if you want to get her in the sack, tell her you love her.  That's how I was duped. 
KEVIN I don't want to dupe her, Jessica.  If I say it, I have to be sure I mean it. 
JESSICA Well it's up to you.  The Big L, or the Big O. 
Suddenly Stifler comes running up, breathless. 
STIFLER Dickhead!  You gotta see this. 
INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - LITTLE AUDITORIUM - MOMENT LATER 
The VOCAL JAZZ GROUP is practicing, singing one of those doo-wop, Acapella love songs (i.e. "Love You Like I Do"). Singing with the group is none other than Oz.  He's not doing too badly, but mainly he's checking out the various vocal jazz girls.  Smiling at them, giving suave little waves. 
Kevin, Stifler, and Jim take seats in the back of the auditorium, listening. 
JIM This is unexpected. 
STIFLER What did you cocks do to him?  Shit, if Coach Marshall sees this, he'll kick Oz off the team on principle alone. 
The song finishes.  Oz bounds up to the other guys. 
OZ Hey guys, you came to watch me in action? 
JIM Yeah, I think you sounded pretty good. 
STIFLER I think you need your balls reattached. 
OZ Keep it down, dude. 
STIFLER What the fuck are you doing here? 
OZ This place is an untapped resource. Check it out, dude, these vocal jazz girls are hot. 
ANGLE ON SOME VOCAL JAZZ GIRLS 
A few of the girls are gathering their stuff, one of whom is HEATHER -- conservative-looking, cute. 
VOCAL JAZZ GIRL #1 Hey, we've got Conan the Barbarian singing with us. 
VOCAL JAZZ GIRL #2 Maybe he'll crush some beer cans on his forehead. 
HEATHER I think he's got a nice voice. 
VOCAL JAZZ GIRL #1 (ribbing her) Go talk to him, maybe you can teach him how to read. 
Heather shakes her head.  BACK TO: 
STIFLER You dipshit, you're expecting to score with some goody-goody choir-girl priss? 
OZ Dude, watch me work.  They go for sensitive studs like me. 
Oz waves goodbye to a final choir girl. 
EXT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - COURTYARD - LATER 
Finch is sitting on a bench, reading the paper, carefree. Kevin and Jim approach. 
KEVIN This is your plan, Finch? 
FINCH Yep. 
He turns a page.  Skims the articles.  A beat. 
KEVIN This.  Right now. 
KEVIN'S BROTHER (V.O.) It originally started as a sex manual, this book that some guys brought back from Amsterdam in the early eighties. What to do with your tongue, things like that.  And each year, it got passed on to one East student who was worthy of it. 
Kevin kneels down on the floor, near a section of various bibles on the bottom shelf. 
KEVIN'S BROTHER (V.O.)(cont'd) After a couple years, guys started adding their own techniques.  Things they figured out themselves. 
Kevin slides out the section of bibles from the bottom shelf.  Pulls out a pocket knife.  Flips up the bottom of the shelf.  Slides it out. 
KEVIN'S BROTHER (V.O.)(cont'd) You have to keep it a secret, and return it at the end of the year.  So, now you know.  Good luck. 
There, a bit dusty, is an old book.  Many extra pages of notebook paper have been tucked into it, nearly breaking the binding.  The original title is now obscured -- over it, someone has written "The Bible." 
Remember when Indian Jones found that gold statue?  It's like that right now. 
Kevin carefully pulls it out.  Reverently flips through it.  Full of details.  Explicit diagrams.  Anecdotes. And atop each handwritten page is a year, indicating the date it was added. 
Kevin reaches the last page.  It's blank.  He lightly runs his hand down the empty page. 
INT. JIM'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY 
Jim enters his house, slinging his backpack off his shoulder. 
JIM (yells) Mom?!  I'm home! 
No response.  Jim walks into the kitchen, noticing a fresh-baked pie on the counter.  Next to it is a note: "Jimmy - Apple, your favorite.  I'll be home late. Enjoy!  Love Mom." 
Jim sniffs the pie, taking in the aroma.  Then stops...as a quizzical look spreads across his face. 
After a moment of thought, he slides a finger into the pie.  Moves it around a bit, studying the consistency. 
Then Jim becomes more curious.  We can see the gears in his head start to turn.  He looks down at the pie like it's... well, not a pie. 
EXT. JIM'S HOUSE - DAY 
Jim's dad gets out of his car, carrying his briefcase. 
INT. JIM'S HOUSE - CONTINUING 
Jim's dad comes in the door and stops dead in his tracks. His face drops, appalled. 
JIM'S DAD Jim? 
JIM It's not what it looks like! 
CUT TO: 
INT. JIM'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY 
Jim and his Dad sit in silence, opposite each other at the table.  Jim stares into his lap, humiliated.  Jim's dad is crushed.  You've never seen such disappointment... but he's trying to keep his chin up for Jim's sake. 
In the middle of the table is the pie.  It's decimated. Mushed up, ruined...violated. 
JIM'S DAD (fighting back tears) I guess...we'll just tell your mother...that we ate it all. 
INT. KEVIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Late.  Kevin sits on his bed, reading a book -- the Bible. 
If all students studied the way Kevin's studying this book, we'd have a nation of geniuses.  He's scrutinizing it.  Turning it sideways and upside down as if trying to decipher cave paintings. 
INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - LITTLE AUDITORIUM - DAY 
The Vocal Jazz Group is doing a song.  Oz is singing along, really making it look like he's into it.  He closes his eyes, singing with even more enthusiasm.  As the song ends, Oz continues just a moment more with his shtick -- a little, heartfelt vocal "scat" to tag the number.  The thing is, it actually sounds really good. 
Oz opens his eyes...to see the whole group -- especially the girls -- looking at him, somewhat awed. 
The CHOIR TEACHER is a smartly-dressed black woman. 
CHOIR TEACHER What the hell was that? 
OZ Sorry. 
CHOIR TEACHER No, it was good. 
OZ Oh, well... (noticing Heather looking at him, he acts "sensitive") It came from the heart. 
CHOIR TEACHER Well then keep it coming. (to everyone) Alright, people, good work!  Keep it up and we'll do great at the state competition. 
Rehearsal wraps up, and Heather comes up to Oz. 
HEATHER Not bad, Chris. 
OZ (surprised himself) Really?  Hey, thanks -- Heather, right? 
HEATHER Yeah...so...you've got this sort of... Bobby McFerrin thing going there. 
OZ (no idea) Yeah.  Right, uh-huh. (then, back into it) I feel like I've discovered this whole new side of me.  Music is so expressive. 
KEVIN (cont'd) Excuse me.  Do you know who Paul Finch is? 
RANDOM CUTE GIRL Of course!  Have you guys seen his tattoo? 
KEVIN ...Yes? 
RANDOM CUTE GIRL Is it cool?  I heard it was like an eagle, blazing in fire and stuff. 
JIM (nods, loving it) Actually, it's an eagle and this big python. 
RANDOM CUTE GIRL Really?! 
JIM Yeah, see it's on his stomach, here, and the eagle -- the eagle is actually grasping the python in its talons, so the snake is like his -- 
KEVIN (interrupting) That's good, Jim. 
RANDOM CUTE GIRL Woah, no way!  That guy is so cool! 
She hurries off to tell her friends.  The guys exit the classroom. 
INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - SENIOR HIGH LOCKERS - CONTINUING 
OZ Okay, explain. 
KEVIN I can't, I have no idea how he's doing it.  And that leaves you trailing, Jim.  You gotta get your act together. 
JIM (a little aggravated) Yeah, I know.  I'm working on it. 
Jim turns around -- to find Nadia is standing right in front of him.  Jim says nothing.  Stuck.  Staring.  Oz elbows him.  Jim gives a startled GRUNT. 
NADIA You are very good in the world history class, yes? 
JIM (gulps) Me? 
Jim looks over to Kevin and Oz, who excitedly give him encouraging looks and gestures. 
JIM (CONT'D) (trying to decipher the guys' signals) Yes.  No.  Yes. 
NADIA Perhaps you can help me with my studies? 
The guys nod, "Yes!  Yes!" 
JIM Okay...that would be cool sometime. (sees the guys gesticulating) How 'bout tomorrow? 
NADIA Well, I do have ballet practice. Perhaps I can come by your house afterwards.  I can change clothes at your place? 
JIM (barely, overwhelmed) I suppose that would be okay. 
Nadia walks off.  Jim collapses into Oz's and Kevin's arms, like a marathon runner at the end of a race.  They pat him heartily in congratulations. 
EXT. RAST GREAT FALLS - SIDE OF SCHOOL - DAY 
After school.  Oz is there as Heather pulls up in a new Saab. 
OZ Nice car. 
HEATHER I'm glad you think so. 
OZ You don't like it? 
HEATHER No, I like the car. (then, direct) By the way, though, about prom?  That was like a bad idea.  Sorry I invited you. 
She hastily walks towards the school. 
OZ What?! 
HEATHER Oh, please.  I asked you because I thought you might actually be worth going with.  But you are just a jock. No wait.  You're a jerk. 
OZ What?  No I'm not. 
HEATHER I saw you making fun of me with your lacrosse buddies. 
OZ I wasn't making fun of you. 
HEATHER Give me a break, you're so full of it. 
She hurries up more, breaking off from Oz, and enters the school.  After a moment, he slowly heads in. 
INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - LITTLE AUDITORIUM - LATER 
Oz and Heather are singing with the group, at opposite ends of the room.  It's a pop, contemporary arrangement of "HOW SWEET IT IS."  It sounds jazzy, cool. 
Oz looks dazed, like the wind's taken out of him.  He sings along, distant.  Heather, almost defiantly, sings clearer and better than ever.  Oz watches her, though she never looks his way.  At the bride of the song, Heather breaks into a solo.  She sings beautifully.  Oz is hooked. 
The Choir Teacher halts the song. 
CHOIR TEACHER Okay, Heather, that was good, but I want to thicken up that solo. Michigan State is this Saturday, and I want that part to smoke. 
Jim's dad gives a knowing look and exits. 
INT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - BROTHER'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME 
STIFLER'S YOUNGER BROTHER, 11, a monster, is tugging at Stifler, who sits at the computer, watching Jim's room. 
STIFLER'S BROTHER Steve!  Steve!  It's my computer and I wanna use it! 
STIFLER Shut up and watch this, you might learn something. 
INT. JIM'S BEDROOM - DAY 
JIM So you need to change, right? 
NADIA Do you mind?  This fabric is so uncomfortable. 
She sets her duffel on Jim's bed. 
JIM No, go right ahead and get dressed. I'll just be downstairs, studying up. Get me when you're ready. 
Jim exits, closing the door behind him. 
INT. KEVIN'S BEDROOM - DAY - SAME TIME 
KEVIN Here we go. 
INT. JIM'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - CONTINUING 
He's off!  Jim sprints down the hall.  Thunders down the stairs. 
INT. JIM'S HOUSE - CONTINUING 
Jim's Mom and Dad are sitting downstairs.  Jim bolts through the room. 
JIM Be back in a sec! 
He practically crashes through the door on his way out. 
JIM'S MOM Jim?  Honey, where are you going? 
She turns and looks at her husband.  Both perplexed. 
EXT. STREET - CONTINUING 
Jim runs like hell. 
INT. JIM'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME 
Nadia unzips her duffel, pulling some clothes out. 
EXT. KEVIN'S HOUSE - CONTINUING 
Jim trucks across the lawn to the door. 
INT. KEVIN'S BEDROOM - DAY 
Kevin and Finch are watching the computer screen. 
KEVIN Want a beer? 
Finch simply waves off the question.  He's glued to the screen. 
Jim bursts into the room, breathless. 
JIM Did I miss anything?! 
KEVIN Just in time. 
Jim grabs a seat by the computer.  All three guys watch, transfixed.  Nadia is slipping out of her leotard. 
JIM Woah! 
Nadia's leotard is off.  Bra and panties.  Outstanding body. 
INTERCUT BETWEEN JIM'S BEDROOM and the guys around the computer screen in Kevin's Bedroom. 
Nadia pauses.  Looks in Jim's full-length mirror. Admiring her body. 
KEVIN Oh, man!  This is incredible. 
And...yes!  Nadia peels off her sportsbra.  Supple breasts.  The guys are awestruck. 
KEVIN (CONT'D) I can't believe Oz had to work. 
INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - LITTLE AUDITORIUM - DAY 
Oz sits alone in the empty vocal jazz rehearsal area.  He sighs, leafing through some sheet music.  It's as quiet and boring as can be. 
INT. BASEMENT - DAY - SAME TIME 
A GROUP OF STONERS log onto the page.  A LITTLE MONKEY hops around in a cage. 
STONER #1 Whoa. 
STONER #2 Kind. 
INT. JIM'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - CONTINUING 
Jim still waits outside his bedroom door.  Takes a deep breath.  Looks upwards to the sky. 
JIM Please, God.  Let this be it. 
INT. KEVIN'S BEDROOM - DAY 
KEVIN He's going in! 
INT. ANOTHER BEDROOM - DAY 
We see a bedroom full of GUYS. 
GUY #1 There's somebody going in there! 
INT. BASEMENT - DAY - SAME TIME 
STONER #1 Hey, that guy's in my trig class. 
INT. JIM'S BEDROOM - DAY 
Jim stands there, bewildered.  Nadia hasn't noticed him, eyes closed, still pleasuring herself.  Jim stands there, watching, faltering.  Gathers his courage.  Finally, he rolls his eyes and says -- 
JIM Looks like you could use an extra hand. 
Nadia's eyes flash open. 
NADIA (chastising) James!  You have come in here on purpose?! 
JIM Well...uh... 
NADIA Shame on you! 
JIM Uh...yeah...sorry. 
NADIA Well.  You have seen me.  Now it is my turn to see you.  Strip. 
JIM Strip? 
NADIA Yes, slowly. 
Jim sneaks a nervous glance over to the QuickCam. 
JIM You mean like, strip strip? 
NADIA (irresistably sexy) For me? 
INT. KEVIN'S BEDROOM - DAY - SAME TIME 
FINCH What do you suppose they're saying? 
KEVIN No idea. 
INT. JIM'S BEDROOM - DAY - CONTINUING 
Nadia leans over to Jim's clock radio.  Turns it on.  We hear COUNTRY MUSIC.  She flips the dial, and we hear A FEW STATIONS FLIP BY.  Then a DRIVING, EURO-TECHNO SONG. 
NADIA Perfect. 
She turns to Jim. 
JIM Uh... 
NADIA Move with the music. 
JIM Um...okay... 
He struts clumsily back and forth.  Takes his shirt off. Swings it in a circle around his head...and lets go of it, aiming for the QuickCam, where it lands. 
NADIA No, no, you must put your whole body into it. 
JIM Nadia, I can't -- 
NADIA Can't what?  Do you not want to be with me?  I wish to be entertained, James. 
Jim nods eagerly.  Concentrates on the music...as we see the shirt slide off the camera.  Jim starts writhing to the beat.  Like a hyperactive chicken. 
INT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - BROTHER'S BEDROOM - CONTINUING 
INT. KEVIN'S BEDROOM - DAY 
KEVIN Oh no. 
INT. BASEMENT - DAY - SAME TIME 
The stoners look...well, stoned. 
STONER #1 Bummer. 
INT. GIRL'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME 
The girls are LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY. 
INT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - BROTHER'S BEDROOM - DAY 
STIFLER'S BROTHER What happened?!  What happened?! 
STIFLER He blew it.  Literally. 
INT. JIM'S BEDROOM - DAY 
Nadia is getting dressed. 
NADIA You are done, James.  Perhaps I should be going now. 
JIM No, no, I'm not done!  I've got reserves!  Nadia, please please please.  I'm begging you. 
She sees the desperation in his eyes.  Thinks about it. Smiles. 
NADIA I do like your dirty magazines. 
Jim digs into the stack of pornos.  Grabs SHAVED. 
JIM Did you see this?  This is your more exotic dirty magazine. 
NADIA Yes...James, it is knowing that these beautiful women arouse you that arouses me... 
JIM Oh yes.  Very arousing women.  They arouse me very much.  But not as arousing as you. 
She goes for this line.  Gives in. 
NADIA Oh Jim... 
She grabs him.  Starts caressing his body. 
INT. KEVIN'S BEDROOM - DAY 
KEVIN/FINCH Yes!! 
INT. BASEMENT - DAY - SAME TIME 
STONER #1 Alright, dude! 
INT. ANOTHER BEDROOM - DAY 
GUY #1 He's re-engaging! 
A CHEER goes up as the guys CELEBRATE. 
INT. JIM'S BEDROOM - DAY 
Groping.  They're tangled in each other.  Nadia backs off for a moment.  Slowly, teasing, she hooks her thumbs in the sides of her panties.  Starts sliding them down. 
NADIA So, "shaved" is the expression? 
CLOSE UP on Jim as his eyes bug out.  Yep, it is, and she is. 
JIM (mutters) Holy shit. 
INT. KEVIN'S BEDROOM - DAY 
KEVIN Holy shit! 
INT. ANOTHER BEDROOM - DAY 
ALL THE GUYS (unison) HOLY SHIT! 
INT. JIM'S BEDROOM - DAY 
Jim is stuck.  Staring at Nadia.  She moves towards him. Nadia is inches from his face. 
NADIA Touch me Jim...here. 
Jim is trembling, straining with himself.  A shudder runs through him. 
And it's over, again. 
JIM (interrupting) What was your name again? 
MICHELLE Michelle. 
JIM Okay.  Michelle, do you want to be my date for the prom? 
MICHELLE Really?  You seriously want to go with me? 
JIM (so forced) Yes.  Seriously. 
MICHELLE Are we going to Steve Stifler's party afterwards?  That would be so cool. 
JIM Whatever you want. 
MICHELLE Cool!  We're gonna have so much fun! It's like this one time, at band camp... 
INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - HALLWAY - A LITTLE LATER 
Heather is walking down the hall.  She turns to go into the Little Auditorium -- and through the window in the door she sees Oz.  She stops. 
Oz is singing, working through the solo.  Determined to get it right.  He bounces his lacrosse ball off the floor, in rhythm, keeping time.  There's one point that he keeps getting stuck at and going back over.  Heather watches this, softening as she sees that Oz is actually putting his heart into it.  Finally he's frustrated -- 
OZ Dammit! 
He whips the lacrosse ball at the wall.  Heather recoils, still watching, unseen by Oz.  After a moment, Oz cools off.  He gets the ball, and diligently starts up again. Heather is impressed. 
INT. VICKY'S BEDROOM - DAY 
Vicky is doing calculus homework, as Kevin looks on, rubbing her shoulders. 
KEVIN You're not doing the extra credit problems. 
VICKY No, I'm not.  I'm writing a sequence of random numbers that look like I'm doing the extra credit problems.  Mr. Bender doesn't bother to check homework past April. 
KEVIN That's my trick! 
VICKY It's everyone's trick, Kevin. (she turns to him) But I did pick it up from you. 
She gives him a little kiss on his hand, continuing with her work.  Kevin keeps rubbing her back, more serious. 
KEVIN We've come a long way since Homecoming. 
VICKY (playful) Yeah, we have.  You corrupted my four- point into a three-nine-five. 
KEVIN Indeed I did.  But, our relationship. It's progressed a lot.  It's time for us to...express ourselves in new ways. 
Vicky stops working and turns, sitting up on the desk, facing him.  Her mood has shifted, more romantic. 
VICKY Like how? 
KEVIN Well, I feel that...things are getting to that point in a relationship. When two people share...a special moment between them. 
VICKY I think you're so right, Kevin. 
KEVIN (pause) You want to do it? 
VICKY Yes -- 
She takes his hand.  Readies herself, and declares. 
VICKY (CONT'D) I love you. 
Kevin falters.  This is definitely not what he was expecting.  He's caught.  Trying to formulate a response. 
VICKY (CONT'D) Kevin?  Do you not love me? 
KEVIN No, I don't not love you.  I like, I know that we've definitely got something between us.  Something good. Something special. 
VICKY But you don't love me. 
KEVIN I didn't say that.  I mean, love, it's like a term that gets thrown around. People say things, they get married, have kids, and then what?  It's like they call it off, going "I was wrong." 
A beat.  Vicky seems to know where he's coming from. 
VICKY Kevin...you're not your dad.  The two of us, we're not your parents. 
KEVIN I know, Vick.  I'm just not ready yet, okay? 
VICKY Okay. 
INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT 
Oz is closing up the store.  He looks up to see Heather at the door.  Oz goes and opens it, surprised, embarrassed.  The air is awkward between them. 
HEATHER Hi... 
OZ How did you know I was here? 
Pure agony.  Finch is sweating badly.  Every muscle in his body is tensed.  Tears stream from his fiercely shut eyes. 
A gastric RUMBLING.  Finch's eyes flash open in terror. 
INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - BATHROOM - DAY 
We hear another, deeper RUMBLING.  Girl #2 turns to her friend in surprise. 
GIRL #2 Joanie, was that you? 
INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - BATHROOM STALL - DAY 
Finch is struggling.  Rocking back and forth.  But it's no use.  He's at his limit. 
FINCH Aaaaaaarrrgghhhh! 
INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - BATHROOM - DAY 
The girls at the mirror freeze -- and we hear what can only be the SOUND OF DIARRHEA exploding into a toilet bowl. 
The girls run out SCREAMING and LAUGHING. 
INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - BATHROOM - DAY - MOMENTS LATER 
Finch exits the stall with trepidation, pulling up his pants.  Slowly, slinking, he approaches the door.  Grabs the handle.  Composes himself.  And like nothing ever happened, he opens it. 
INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - MAIN HALL - DAY 
Finch comes out of the bathroom.  Stops.  His eyes register complete disbelief. 
A SEMI-CIRCLE OF GIRLS, including the ones we have seen gossiping about him, has crowded around the door.  All staring at him with complete repugnance, open-mouthed. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. LACROSSE FIELD (MSU) - DAY 
Oz is playing in the final lacrosse game.  The team scores -- they're beating Central.  Everyone cheers, except Oz.  We see Jim and Kevin in the stands, CHEERING. 
EXT. MUSIC HALL (MSU) - DAY 
Establishing.  The campus of Michigan State University. Students pass in front of an older, impressive university building. 
A sign out front reads, "MICHIGAN STATEWIDE VOCAL COMPETITION." 
INT. BACKSTAGE (MSU) - DAY 
Heather and the rest of the vocal jazz group are behind the curtain. 
They all wear flashy, borderline cool outfits.  Heather looks worried, lost.  Looking to the door, as if Oz might come running in. 
VOCAL JAZZ TEACHER Okay.  Albert, you ready? 
ALBERT steps next to Heather.  He's kind of funny- looking, with an overly-suave attitude that comes off as plain weird. 
ALBERT No problemo. 
He SINGS a couple lines.  Way too melodramatic and cheesy.  Heather looks trapped. 
EXT. LACROSSE FIELD (MSU) - DAY 
A scoreboard shows that East is leading by five goals. Oz is running up the field, towards the goal, cradling the ball in his stick.  He seems to have a good lead. Suddenly he is tumbling, falling, losing the ball. Someone has checked him.  He lays stunned on the ground, as Stifler recovers the ball and scores. 
The players run back to the sidelines to reset for the face-off, and gather around the coach. 
COACH MARSHALL Alright!  Good hustle, guys, but we can still lose.  You all saw what happened to Oz out there.  I don't ever want to see you guys thinking you're gonna score.  You don't score until you score, period. 
The team is getting into it.  Shouts of "Hell yeah!"  But Oz's got a quizzical look on his face. 
INT. BACKSTAGE (MSU) - DAY 
Heather waits with the group to go onstage.  Albert paces like a Shakespearean actor, psyching himself. 
ALBERT Focus on the music.  Think melody. Let the music be my guide. 
HEATHER That would be a start. 
EXT. LACROSSE FIELD (MSU) - DAY 
Oz shows some emotion peeking through.  Confused. 
COACH MARSHALL It all boils down to today.  For you seniors, this marks the culmination of your past four years.  Think of what that means to you.  Are you guys gonna look back on your days at East and know that you made the most of the time you had? 
A wave of realization washes over Oz.  He stands up tall. 
COACH MARSHALL (cont'd) Now that's the attitude, Ostreicher! 
Oz collects himself.  Takes a deep breath. 
INT. TUXEDO LAND - DAY 
Jim is trying on a tux.  he shrugs, like it fits well enough. 
He turns to see Oz trying on his -- Oz is fidgeting, trying on different ties, vests, shoes, very sincere and focused. 
INT. VICKY'S BEDROOM - DAY 
Vicky is trying on a rather elegant dress, looking to Jessica for support, showing it off.  Jessica jokingly does the same, showing off her shorts and T-shirt, as if she could care. 
INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - COURTYARD - DAY 
Finch sits alone.  Not like alone.  More like Forrest Gump. 
INT. TUXEDO LAND - DAY 
Jim is paying for his tux.  We see Oz trying to decide on a cumberbund.  There are about ten of them scattered around him that he's already tried.  In the background, an ATTENDANT looks impatient. 
EXT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - COURTYARD - DAY 
Finch still sits.  His head is cocked at a different angle. 
INT. JIM'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Jim's dad fixes Jim's bow tie. 
INT. KEVIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT (END MONTAGE) 
Kevin is in his tux.  He's staring at himself in the mirror. 
EXT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - NIGHT 
The parking lot is full.  VARIOUS FORMALLY DRESSED STUDENTS make their way into the school.  One group piles out of a stretch limo.  We see a STEALTHY STUDENT slip a bottle of liquor into his tux.  A FLUSTERED GUY struggles to re-attach his date's corsage. 
This is the prom. 
INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - GYM - NIGHT 
The gym is decorated in a clashingly festive manner. Like a combination of Mardi Gras, New Year's Eve, and somebody's bar mitzvah.  A CRAPPY BAND plays CRAPPY IMITATION ROCK MUSIC. 
Most students mill about, talking, generally bored.  The only people who are enjoying themselves are the OBVIOUSLY DRUNK STUDENTS, slam-dancing with the obviously drunk Stifler in a corner.  CHAPERONE PARENTS try to calm them down, futilely. 
The band breaks into a CHEESY BALLAD.  Couples lock together and sway back and forth like zombies. 
ANGLE ON JIM AND MICHELLE 
They're dancing at arm's length.  Jim is not enthused. 
MICHELLE You know, at band camp?  We have dances like this.  Only they're way funner.  Don't you think prom is just highly overrated? 
JIM Highly, highly overrated. 
ANGLE ON KEVIN AND VICKY 
They dance.  Both looking a little nervous.  Anxious. 
ANGLE ON OZ AND HEATHER 
Dancing much slower than anyone else.  Tight embrace. Heather's got her head on his shoulder, eyes closed. 
ANGLE ON STIFLER 
Dancing with the Girl Holding out For Finch. 
INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - A CORNER OF THE GYM - NIGHT 
Kevin, Oz, Jim, and Finch are hanging out.  Finch is drunk. 
FINCH Okay.  I'm here for your dumb...dumb meeting. 
Sherman passes by. 
SHERMAN I'm on the offensive, boys.  The Sherman Tank is going back in. 
The guys are impassive.  Sherman indicates the Central Girl nearby. 
SHERMAN (CONT'D) Locked on target, flying in stealth mode under enemy sex radar.  Ready to drop the payload...again. 
Sherman confidently walks off. 
KEVIN Alright, how do you guys stand?  Well, Finch, I know where you are, but you can't use that as an excuse.  Jim? 
JIM My date's a flute-toting band dork. That answer your question? 
KEVIN Oz, how about you and Heather?  Now you guys are a couple or something? 
OZ (getting ticked) Dammit, Kevin, what's with the attitude? 
FINCH Me too.  For the most part. 
KEVIN Nah.  Fuck, you guys are right, I don't know what I'm doing.  I mean I'm acting like I've got it all together tonight.  But I know Vicky is gonna ask me if I love her.  And I don't know what I'm gonna say.  So now it's like, maybe I'll just wimp out on the whole thing. 
JIM Come on man.  Tonight is the night. We're finally going to a post-prom party on the lake.  We've been waiting to do this for the last four years. Why else are we still friends with Stifler?  You gotta go. 
A beat as Kevin ponders this. 
OZ And by the way, Sherman didn't even get laid. 
KEVIN He didn't? 
FINCH Nope.  He pissed himself. 
The guys LAUGH as Kevin is puzzled.  THEY are suddenly illuminated by the glare of headlights.  A charter bus pulls in front of the school. 
JIM There it is.  I want to grab my bag. Oh, and my date. 
OZ Come on, Kevin.  Vicky's looking for you. 
Jim holds out a helping hand.  Kevin looks at it.  Grabs it, and Jim pulls him up. 
EXT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT 
A beautiful cottage on the shore of Lake Michigan. Students are filing out of the charter bus. 
Jim and Michelle are walking up to the cottage. 
JIM Stifler's mom got it in the divorce. 
MICHELLE It reminds me of this one time -- (changing thoughts) Hey, can I ask you a question?  How come you don't have any stories?  I've got lots of stories, and you don't have any. 
JIM Oh, I've got stories, believe me. They're a little more risque than tales of Band Camp. 
MICHELLE Are they gross or something, like guy stuff?  Tell me. 
JIM Okay.  You want a story?  Here's a story.  Stifler finds this beer, right?  And... 
INT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - BEDROOM 
Kevin leads Vicky into the bedroom.  A large bay window overlooks moonlit Lake Michigan. 
KEVIN See -- this is the nicest room. 
VICKY Wow, Kev...it's perfect. 
Vicky opens a closet -- to find Stifler's Little Brother inside, grinning. 
STIFLER'S BROTHER You guys are gonna fuck, aren't you!? 
KEVIN No!  Get out of here! 
STIFLER'S BROTHER (running out of the room) Fuckers fuckers fuckers fuckers! 
Stiflers brother is gone.  They LAUGH...and Vicky closes the door. 
EXT. BEACH - NIGHT 
Oz and Heather are walking down the beach.  Holding hands.  Deep in the background, we see kids partying. 
OZ There's something I've been meaning to tell you, Heather. 
HEATHER What's that? 
OZ It's gonna sound really bad, but I want you to know. 
She nods.  They stop walking.  Oz swipes his feet around in the sand. 
OZ (cont'd) See, uh, I'm a virgin.  And me, Kevin, Jim, and Finch, we all made this pact. That we would...lose our virginity... before high school was over. 
Heather is listening. 
OZ (cont'd) And, see, tonight is supposed to be the night we all do it. 
HEATHER This isn't the best way to proposition me. 
OZ No, that's not what I mean.  I mean -- look.  You know what made me leave that game?  Coach was giving this speech, about not slacking off when you see the opportunity to score. 
HEATHER This isn't any better, Chris. 
OZ No, see Heather, what I realized is that...with you, it's not like I'm running towards the goal, trying to figure out the best way to score.  And this may sound corny, but -- 
He takes her hand. 
OZ (cont'd) I feel like I've already won. 
Heather softens, taken off guard. 
VICKY You sure you're comfortable? 
KEVIN Yeah.  Are you sure? 
VICKY Yeah. 
KEVIN Me too. 
VICKY Okay. (a beat) Did you bring a condom? 
KEVIN Yeah, right here. 
He pulls out a condom.  A beat as they contemplate it. 
KEVIN (CONT'D) So, do you want to be -- I mean, how do you want to do it? 
VICKY I don't know.  How do you? 
KEVIN Like, normal style.  The...missionary position. 
VICKY Okay. 
A moment as they realize there's nothing left to do, but - 
VICKY (cont'd) Kevin... 
KEVIN Yeah Vick? 
VICKY I want to hear you say it. 
KEVIN Okay. 
Kevin swallows hard.  And says -- 
KEVIN (CONT'D) Victoria...I love you. 
VICKY I love you. 
They both take a deep breath. 
EXT. BEACH - NIGHT 
Oz and Heather lay in a secluded spot in the dunes, surrounded by tall beach grass that swishes in the spring breeze.  Stars and a lustrous moon above. 
The silence speaks.  We can see it in their eyes. Yearning. 
OZ I can't think of anything to say that's not cheesy. 
HEATHER Then don't. 
They kiss.  It's time. 
INT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - BEDROOM - NIGHT 
A brief moment of uncertainty.  Kevin shifts around a bit, trying to position himself.  Vicky's hand goes under the sheets. 
VICKY Here. 
We know what she's doing.  They both maintain eye contact... 
EXT. BEACH - NIGHT 
Heather and Oz are re-inventing the idea of passion. Discovering love.  This is the stuff that you thought only existed in romance novels.  Seriously. 
INT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - PARTY ROOM - NIGHT 
Jim is trying to stay interested in Michelle's drivel. 
JIM So, the end of the story is...you had to kiss the guy for twenty seconds? 
MICHELLE Yes!  And he was such a dork!  And everyone laughed at me, but I didn't care?  Because it was so funny! 
JIM (flat) Okay, I get it. 
MICHELLE Oh!  And then this one time?  At band camp?  I stuck a flute in my pussy. 
Jim CHOKES on his beer.  Michelle considers her revelation no big deal, watching with some amusement as Jim struggles to recover. 
JIM ...excuse me?! 
MICHELLE What, you think I don't know how to get myself off?  Hell, that's what half of band camp is!  Sex ed! 
Jim is ga-ga.  He watches in disbelief as she lets her hair down.  And wouldn't you know it, she's pretty cute. 
MICHELLE (cont'd) So are we gonna screw soon?  I'm getting kind of antsy. 
Jim pauses in disbelief.  Then -- 
What we do see is the kitchen door handle rattling.  The chair falling out of place.  And the door opening as Stifler walks in.  He stops, horrified. 
STIFLER Ugh...oh no... 
He looks like he's going to barf.  Instead, he passes out. 
EXT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - SUNRISE - ESTABLISHING 
The sun rises over Lake Michigan.  A brand new day. Various students are passed out here and there. 
EXT. BEACH - DAY 
Oz holds Heather in his arms.  Completely peaceful. SEAGULLS CALL to each other.  WAVES BREAK on the shore. 
Oz has lost all pretense.  Smiling to himself, or maybe to the world. 
INT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - STIFLER'S BROTHER'S BEDROOM - DAY 
Jim wakes up in bed, alone.  He looks around. 
JIM She's gone. 
He considers this. 
JIM (cont'd) Oh my God.  She used me. 
He considers this further.  Smiles. 
JIM (cont'd) Wow!  I was used!  Cool! 
He jumps up and does a little dance, SINGING... 
JIM (CONT'D) Hail! to the victors, valiant; Hail! to the conquering heroes, hail... 
INT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - BEDROOM - DAY 
Kevin and Vicky lie next to each other in bed, staring at the ceiling.  Though they're trying to conceal it, we can see a bit of dissatisfaction, uncertainty, peeking through. 
KEVIN That was a great night. 
VICKY Yeah. 
A beat. 
KEVIN I can't believe we just had our senior prom. 
VICKY Yeah, the time went by so fast. 
KEVIN It did. 
Another beat. 
VICKY Kevin, next year...with you in Ann Arbor, and me in Nashville...it's not gonna work, is it. 
KEVIN Don't say that, we can do it somehow. It might not be perfect, but -- 
VICKY (interrupting) No, Kevin -- (she sits up) That's the whole thing, that's what I've been realizing.  That nothing's perfect, that you can't plan everything. 
Kevin thinks this over. 
KEVIN It is far away...and we'll be on our own...meeting new people... 
A moment as they think this over. 
KEVIN (CONT'D) Vicky...last night...I wasn't lying. 
VICKY I know. (a beat) Let's go.  Don't you have something to tell your friends? 
KEVIN What? 
VICKY Your little pact.  Jessica told me all about it. (hits him lightly) Way to go, Kev! 
Kevin gives an embarrassed smile. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. DOG DAYS - DAY 
A sign on the window reads, "Congratulations Seniors!" 
INT. DOG DAYS - DAY 
The four, newly non-virgins munch on hot dogs.  Kevin's LAUGHING. 
KEVIN (to Jim) I guess we'll call you two-ply. 
OZ Yeah.  So you want double condiments on that?

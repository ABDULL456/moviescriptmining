MICHAEL Okay, okay. How's that guy who dreams about shitting trout? 
BEN (entering, putting on his tux shirt) Fine. He moved up to striped bass. Put on your cummerbund. Boy, have you grown. Did your mother move next door to a nuclear power plant? 
MICHAEL (struggling with the cummerbund) Why do we have to wear rented clothes to Grandpa's party? This blows. 
BEN (helping him) We have to dress up because Grandpa can't have a good time unless everyone else is extremely uncomfortable. (looks at Michael and makes a quick decision) Forget the tux. Regular clothes. 
Ben exits, pulling off the tux shirt. 
MICHAEL (taking off his tux shirt) Are you ambivalent about Grandpa Isaac? 
BEN (O.S.) (from his room) Ambivalent? Where do you get that stuff? 
MICHAEL Mom.

BEN (CONT'D) Your mother and I, when we got divorced, we agreed we wouldn't put you in the middle, or use you as a go-between to talk about each other. So just do me a favor and tell your mother to shut her big mouth. (comes back into Michael's room) Did she say anything about me getting married again? I think she could be feeling a little anger about it. 
MICHAEL Oh, yeah. She really cares. She says you're intimidated by women your own age, and that's why you go for these young babes. 
BEN (fuming) Okay. Listen, for two seconds, pretend I'm not your father. I'm just some guy, okay? 
MICHAEL You gonna vent?

JELLY (reluctantly) A lot of people think you set him up. 
VITTI Why the fuck would I want to kill Dominic? He was like a father to me. 
JELLY So you could be the big boss. Everybody figures you're lookin' to wipe out the competition before the big meeting.

Nicky goes suddenly quiet. He watches in terror as Jimmy steps aside and Vitti moves close holding a short length of lead pipe. 
VITTI Nicky, you know me, right? 
NICKY Yeah.   You're Mr. Vitti. 
VITTI And you know what I'm gonna do to you if you lie to me, right? 
NICKY Uh, you're gonna crack me on the head with that pipe? 
JIMMY (slaps him) It's a rhetorical question, you fuckin' idiot. 
VITTI I'm only gonna ask you this one time. Who killed Dominic Manetta? 
NICKY I don't know. 
VITTI (roars) Don't fuckin' lie to me! 
NICKY (in tears) Honest to God, I don't know!

JELLY Anything. 
VITTI You have to find me a doctor. 
JELLY We just came from the doctor. 
VITTI Not that kind of doctor.   I need a head doctor. 
JELLY You're gonna change your face like Sonny Black? Don't get his nose though, he looks like a pig. 
VITTI Not a plastic surgeon, ya spoostud. Do I have to spell everything out? 
JELLY It saves time. 
VITTI I need you to find me a psychiatrist. 
JELLY Wow. This is like the Psychic Network or something. I just ran into a psychiatrist. Actually he ran into me.

VITTI It's not for me. It's for a friend. This friend is having some problems, so I'm going to ask the shrink some questions and get some answers for my friend. 
JELLY Got it. 
VITTI And nobody can know. If anyone hears I'm talking to a shrink, it could be interpreted the wrong way. You know what I mean?

BEN Carl, I'm detecting a pattern here. You seem to settle too easily for things. 
CARL You're right.    I do. 
BEN No, well, there you go. You just did it again. I suggested something and you immediately agreed.

CARL You're right.    I did. 
BEN Why do you think you do that? 
CARL I don't know. 
BEN Well, sometimes people do it because they fear rejection or disapproval, but you can't let that worry you, Carl. And you can't agree with things just for the sake of agreeing. Stand your ground. Don't let people roll over you. 
The door opens and Jelly enters. 
JELLY Dr. Sobol? 
BEN Excuse me!    I'm in a session here. 
JELLY Yeah, I know, I'm sorry. 
BEN You're... You're one of the guys I rear-ended the other night. 
JELLY Bingo. (to Carl) Get outta here.

Jelly pulls a big roll of bills out of his pocket, removes the rubber band, and peels off a couple of fifties.

VITTI What's with all you doctors and the fuckin' panic? Did I say panic? 
BEN Not panic. Dizzy -- breathing -- chest pain attacks. 
VITTI Right. So the question is, what can he do to make it stop? 
Ben decides to go for it. 
BEN I'm going to go out on a limb here. I think your friend is you. 
VITTI You -- you -- you -- you have a gift, my friend. Go on. 
BEN Medication could help, but if you really want to get to the bottom of this, you're going to want to get some kind of therapy. 
VITTI With you? 
BEN (hedging) With me? Oh, I don't know. I'd have to look at my schedule. I'm very heavily booked right now and I'm going on a short vacation tomorrow.

BEN Well, I really didn't do anything -- 
VITTI You did something. The load? Off. Where is it? Don't know. You're good, Doctor. I'll be in touch. But listen to me. (leaning close, menacing) If I talk to you and it turns me into a fag, I'll kill you. You understand? 
BEN Could we define 'fag,' because some feelings may come up -- 
Vitti silences him with a wave of his hand.

VITTI Of course, you and me. (hugs him) Have fun at the pool. Stay out of the deep end. And don't swim for a couple hours after you eat. 
ANTHONY Okay, Papa. 
He kisses his father and exits with the others. 
VITTI (to Jelly) Send Jimmy down with them. 
JELLY Already done. 
Jelly exits.

BEN About this? I think she'd be more worried about your career choice. 
VITTI Just keep going with the therapy. 
He crosses to the bar, pours himself a drink, and lights a cigarette. 
BEN You know, normally a patient wouldn't smoke or drink during a session. 
VITTI (blowing smoke) That's an interesting fact I'll have to remember if I'm ever on 'Jeopardy.' 
BEN So tell me about your father. 
VITTI My father. He was a big man in the neighborhood -- very well respected. Everybody loved him, God rest his soul. 
BEN He passed away? 
VITTI No, I just like saying 'God rest his soul.' Yeah, he passed away. He died when I was about twelve. 
BEN How? 
VITTI Heart attack.    Sudden thing. 
BEN Were you and your father close? 
VITTI Close? Yeah, you know, pretty close. I guess we weren't getting along that great right then.

BEN Why was that? 
VITTI I was hangin'   out in the neighborhood.    I had a borghata -- like a kid   gang -- hooligan shit, nothin'   big. But my father didn't   like it. 
BEN You fought about it? 
VITTI He slapped the shit out of me. 
BEN And then? 
VITTI And then that night he died. 
BEN How did that feel? 
VITTI It felt great! How did it feel? (shrugs) I don't know. 
BEN Well, think about it. Were you angry, were you afraid? Sad? 
VITTI Yeah, I guess. 
BEN Any feelings of guilt? 
VITTI About what?   I didn't kill him. 
BEN I'm just speculating, but maybe in some way you wanted him to die. 
VITTI Why would I want my father to die?

VITTI English. 
BEN Oedipus was a Greek king who killed his father and married his mother. 
VITTI Fuckin' Greeks. 
BEN It's an   instinctual developmental drive.    The young boy wants to replace   his father so he can totally   possess his mother. 
VITTI Are you saying I wanted to fuck my mother?

BEN Onto me? What are you talking about? Being an accessory to murder was not part of our understanding. 
VITTI Hey, why you busting my balls? I didn't kill him. I can't speak for everyone in the room, but -- (he looks at Jelly) The son-of-a-bitch came after me! It was self-defense. Trust me, Doc. In this one, we're the good guys.

BEN Right.   Was.   That's what I meant. 
LAURA But not like a real patient. 
BEN Right. 
PROVANO So why did he send you that fountain?

VITTI It's none of anybody's business what I say in there. 
MASIELLO Paul, I beg to differ. If you're doing this to establish some kind of insanity defense later, that's one thing. But everybody's gonna think you're falling apart, and that ain't good. They'll take it as a sign of weakness, and that makes us all vulnerable. Sindone would take over everything. 
VITTI So what do you want me to do? 
MASIELLO It's time to end it. 
VITTI What do you mean, end it? 
MASIELLO Get rid of this shrink.   He knows too much already. 
VITTI You want me to whack my doctor? 
MASIELLO If you don't do it, somebody else will. It's the only way.

BEN I think you do. 
VITTI (puts the gun to Ben's head) It's over! Don't you get it? I took one chance and that's it. 
BEN Okay. (as Vitti cocks the gun) Can I ask you one last question? 
VITTI (a beat) What? 
BEN What did you order? 
VITTI What? 
BEN What did you order? 
VITTI When? 
BEN That night. What were you eating the night your father got killed? 
VITTI How the hell do I know? 
BEN You don't remember? 
VITTI It was 35 years ago. 
BEN What did your father have? 
VITTI I told you!   I don't remember. 
BEN Try.

JELLY Jesus, the guy's fallin' apart. 
JIMMY Why doesn't he just pop him?   It's embarrassing.

Suddenly, there is a GUNSHOT and a BULLET RICOCHETS off the TOP of the CAR. 
BEN Oh, my God! 
90   HANDSOME JACK                                                       90 
He OPENS UP with a MAC-10. 
JELLY AND JIMMY 
Jimmy goes down, hit in the shoulder.      Jelly dives for cover behind a rusted car body. 
VITTI AND BEN 
BEN (in a panic) Paul!   They're shooting! 
Vitti continues to sob, oblivious to the GUN BATTLE raging around him. 
JELLY 
He FIRES back at Handsome Jack. 
POTATOES 
He rakes the Lincoln with a BURST from the ASSAULT RIFLE. 
JELLY'S CAR 
All the WINDOWS ARE BLOWN OUT by the GUNFIRE.     Ben screams. 
BEN Paul! For God's sake, shoot somebody! 
Vitti just sits there on the ground, still sobbing quietly. 
JELLY 
He reloads and FIRES again.

POTATOES 
Jelly's last SHOT strikes him right in the chest, and he goes down. 
HANDSOME JACK 
He sees Potatoes fall and starts moving out, covering his retreat with another BURST from his MACHINE GUN. 
JELLY'S CAR 
Something snaps inside Ben. 
BEN Goddamn it! 
He takes the GUN out of Vitti's hand and starts FIRING WILDLY. 
JELLY 
He sees Handsome Jack emerge from cover and takes him out with FIVE QUICK SHOTS. 
HANDSOME JACK 
He goes down FIRING, dead before he hits the ground. 
SCRAP YARD 
It's suddenly quiet. After a long moment, Jimmy rolls over and moans. Jelly goes to him and starts examining his wound.

Ben stands up, still holding Vitti's gun.    He sees Handsome Jack lying dead on the ground. 
BEN Oh my God!    Did I do that? 
JELLY No, Doc. That one's mine. You got the Chevy Camaro and the side-by-side refrigerator-freezer.

RABBI Excuse me? 
BEN No, not you.    I was talking to him. 
RABBI Who him? 
BEN It's not important.     Yes. 
RABBI Yes what? 
BEN Yes to the thing before. To her. That's a yes. Pick it up from there. 
Jelly moves closer.       The guests start to mutter. 
JELLY (to Ben) Doc, we're going to need to hurry it up here. (to Michael) Hi, kid. 
LAURA I do not believe this! 
JELLY (to the Rabbi) Haul ass, buddy. We got a problem. 
LAURA Who the hell do you think you are?

JELLY (to Ben) Ooh, she's feisty. Watch out, Doc. (to the Rabbi) Tick tock, let's go. Hurry up and pronounce them, huh? 
RABBI By the power vested me by the state of New York, I now pronounce you man and wife. 
JELLY Okay.   Kiss, kiss -- 
Ben and Laura kiss. 
JELLY I'm sorry about this, Mrs. Sobol, but duty calls, you know? 
LAURA (tearing up) Oh. You're the first person to call me Mrs. Sobol. 
JELLY Nice, huh? 
LAURA No. 
BEN Laura, I'm sorry. It's the job. 
LAURA Go.  Just go. (to Jelly) Have him back here by the salad course or you're in serious trouble. Capiche? 
JELLY You're a pistol. (to Ben) I like her. 
Ben kisses Laura, then the organist plays "Here Comes the Bride" as Jelly and Ben hurry down the aisle together.

Ben comes out of the function room with Jelly. 
JELLY He's bad, Doc. Worse than I ever seen him. I think his inner child is all fucked up. 
BEN Have you ever seen an episode like this? 
JELLY Yes. Once on 'Bonanza,' Hoss Cartwright got bit by a raccoon. He got this fever and he was shaking -- 
BEN Never mind.

Jelly and Ben come out of the hotel into the garage area. 
JELLY This is serious, Doc. If he doesn't make this meeting, they'll kill him for sure. 
BEN Can't someone else in the family go for him? Tommy the Tongue? Louie the Lip? What about you? You go? 
JELLY That would work except for one little detail. I'm a fucking moron. I'm known for it. (a beat) You have to go. 
BEN Me?   You must be a moron.

JELLY Hey!   Watch that. 
BEN You just said it yourself. 
JELLY It's different when I say it. When you say it, it sounds very negative. 
BEN I'm sorry, Jelly, but I'm not going. I'm not on the payroll anymore, so forget about it. My wife is waiting -- 
He turns to go back into the hotel. 
JELLY Doc.

Around the tables sit forty or fifty of the biggest gangsters in the world. A few captains stand around the perimeter, ready to serve their bosses. 
BEN These are the bosses? That one looks like my Uncle Max. 
Jelly steers Ben to an empty seat next to Carlo Mangano. 
MANGANO (surprised) What's goin' on? Where's Vitti? 
JELLY On his way.   Don't worry. 
Mangano eyes Ben with contempt. 
MANGANO What's he doin' here? 
JELLY He's -- it's okay. Forget about it. 
MANGANO Forget about it? What the hell is that? 
Seated directly across the room from Ben is Primo Sindone. He stares hard at Ben, trying to place him, then leans over to Moony, his consigliere. 
SINDONE Who's the guy with Jelly? 
MOONY I don't know. 
Ben looks away nervously. 
BEN (to Jelly, borderline hysterical) I can't do this. 
He starts to get up but Jelly pulls him back down. 
Moony stands up and gets everyone's attention.

MOONY All right, gentlemen. I think we better start. We have a big agenda, so for now let's stick to the big issues. And it would help if you identify yourselves when you speak, since we don't all know each other, and we didn't think anybody would be into wearing any fucking name tags. 
Laughter around the table. 
Sindone stands up and looks straight at Ben. 
SINDONE I'm Primo Sindone. They call me Sonny Long. It's good to see so many of the old faces here, and to welcome the new ones from all over the country. I see Frank Zello, and Joe Baldassare, but I'm a little disappointed to see that the head of our other New York family isn't here today. All I see is his man Jelly and some sawed-off little prick nobody knows. 
Jelly looks at Ben, waiting for him to speak, but Ben just sits, frozen, looking down at his hands. 
JELLY (stands up, rattled) Yeah, well, the thing is Mr. Vitti has been detained and he sends his apologies for -- being detained -- and he apologizes for his -- detainment. 
SINDONE Detained? What kind of bullshit is that? What's more important than this? As the host of this meeting, I take his not being here as a sign of disrespect to me and to all these other men, too, who came a long way to be here. 
JELLY Mr. Vitti meant no disrespect. The thing is, he's not feeling well. He's sick and he -- didn't feel well -- 
(CONTINUED)

Ben rises and slaps Jelly hard across the face. 
BEN (quietly) Jelly! We don't ever discuss Mr. Vitti's health outside the family. You know better. 
Jelly is stunned.    The bosses murmur. 
SINDONE All right, who is this guy and what the fuck is he doing here? 
BEN In answer to your first question, my name is Ben Sobol -- (off Sindone's look) -- leone. Sobboleone. They call me -- 'The doctor.' As for your second question. I'm here representing Paul Vitti. As his conser -- conghili -- 
JELLY (prompting) Consigliere -- 
BEN (slaps him again) Don't you ever correct me again! As his consigliere, I'm intimately involved in all aspects of the family business and I'm prepared to speak for Mr. Vitti on all matters. 
SINDONE Okay, Doctor, then let's get down to business. Everybody knows there's been this thing between me and Paul Vitti for a long time. 
BEN Which thing are you talking about? The first thing or the second thing? 
SINDONE What second thing? I only know one thing. 
(CONTINUED) 
108   CONTINUED:    (4)                                               108 
BEN Well, I don't see how we can discuss the first thing without bringing up the second thing. Didn't you talk to the guy? 
He tugs meaningfully on his earlobe. 
SINDONE What guy? 
BEN The guy with the thing. 
SINDONE What thing? What the fuck are you talking about? 
BEN How should I know? You brought it up. (gestures helplessly to the others) This is the whole problem. You can't have an intelligent conversation with the man. 
SINDONE How about if I just break your fuckin' neck? What do you think of that? 
BEN It's not important what I think. What do you think? 
SINDONE What do I think? I think it's a good idea! Why would I say it if I didn't think it was good?

ZELLO (perplexed) I don't know, Paul. I can see where some people might have a problem with this. 
VITTI I realize that, so as an extra token of good faith between us, I've taken the liberty of writing down everything I know and putting it in a safe deposit box in case anything happens to me or my family. 
There's a long tense silence while the other bosses consider all this. Then, finally -- 
ZELLO I don't know what anybody else thinks, but I say good luck and God bless, Paul. 
BALDASSARE Good luck, Paul. Salut. 
They all raise their glasses and toast Vitti.     Ben raises his glass to Vitti and drinks. 
BEN (to Vitti) Well done. 
Vitti smiles at him and drinks.

Ben and Vitti come out of the building and cross to the car. Jelly is waiting, Iron Mike has the MOTOR RUNNING, and Jimmy is in the front seat with him. 
VITTI Let's move. 
Sindone and Mangano come out with guns drawn, flanked by two wise guys. 
SINDONE Vitti!

Vitti and his crew turn and face Sindone and Mangano across the parking lot. 
VITTI I don't want to do this, Primo. 
SINDONE You don't want to do this? That's fuckin' rich. What did you think, you could just quit and walk away? You think this is a fuckin' civil service job? What are you, crazy? 
VITTI Not anymore. (to Mangano) Hey, Carlo, tell me. You gonna stab me in the back like the piece of shit I always knew you were? 
Mangano stares at him, cold and hard. 
MANGANO I'm not gonna stab you in the back, Paul. I want to see your face when I do it. 
VITTI I don't think so. (calls out) Mo-Mo! 
Mo-Mo stands up from behind a car pointing a shotgun at Mangano and Sindone. 
VITTI Bigs! 
Johnny Bigs steps out from behind a shed holding an assault rifle. 
VITTI Eddie! 
The back of a van opens to reveal Eddie "Cokes" and Tuna manning a military air-cooled machine gun on a tripod. 
VITTI It's over, Primo. Now get the fuck outta here. 
Sindone glares at him, then lowers his gun, turns, and starts to walk back into the building joined by Mangano and the soldiers.

Vitti and Ben relax. 
BEN Good thinking. I was going to bring a machine gun but I don't have one. Of course, we haven't opened the wedding gifts yet. 
Suddenly, Sindone whirls and FIRES at Vitti. 
Ben staggers in front of Vitti and takes the bullet in the shoulder.

An NYPD armored assault vehicle bursts through the gates. Police cruisers and SWAT vans come racing up to the scene, SIRENS SHRIEKING. 
Then, from out of the sky, the FBI helicopter descends, blaring a warning.

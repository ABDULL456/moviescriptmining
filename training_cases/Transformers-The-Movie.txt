FADE IN: 
EXT. SPACE 
A small planet glows in the light of its sun. Suddenly, we hear a loud rumble, and see a thick, electronic mist behind the planet... Then, the electronic mist begins to engulf the planet, and we hear the horrible sounds of destruction. Almost like somebody, or something, is eating it. 
PUSH DOWN TO: 
EXT. THE NEAR SIDE OF THE PLANET'S SURFACE 
Strange robotic creatures scramble around the planet in a wild panic. It looks like Pompeii must have looked as Vesuvius erupted. 
ANGLE ON ONE OF THE CREATURES - TRACKING 
The creature is KRANIX. We will meet him later on in a very different context, but for now, he is running from the ever- growing mist that threatens to engulf him. 
ANOTHER ANGLE - THE PANIC 
As Kranix runs, another creature, ARBLUS, calls to him. 
ARBLUS Transform and flee, Kranix! You must warn all you meet of the horror of Unicron! Suddenly, the pitiful creature is surrounded by the strange energy cloud and it looks like his body has simultaneously caught fire and been doused with acid. 
KRANIX Arblus!   No! 
ANGLE ON KRANIX 
The mist threatens to engulf him too. He transforms into a small rocket ship and... 
TRACK WITH KRANIX AS... 
He takes off. As we rise higher and higher in the atmosphere, we see the horror wrought by the hideous and still mysterious Unicron. The planet cracks like an egg and rivers of lava leak out. The energy cloud surrounds it and... Dissolves everything... ... And when the smoke clears, we get our first look at Unicron. It is horrifying. A massive, metal orb with a gaping maw and a field of electricity. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
PAN FORWARD to SHOW that this hideous planet is on a direct collision course with... 
MOONS ORBITING CYBERTRON IN DEEP SPACE 
There are TWO MECHANISTIC MOONS orbiting the huge planet Cybertron. But we are most concerned with a small, greenish metal one. 
NARRATOR It is the year 2005. The treacherous Decepticons have conquered the Autobots' home planet of Cybertron. But from secret staging grounds on two of Cybertron's moons the valiant Autobots prepare to retake their homeland. 
CLOSER ON GREEN MOON 
At first, we see nothing unusual or suspicious. Then, pulling closer, we see that the top of the moon is covered with moon camouflage "netting" and underneath it is a huge cache of futuristic weapons. This is the Autobot staging ground for an assault on Cybertron. DOLLY THROUGH THE COMPLEX until we arrive at a Command Center where several Autobots peer into monitors, running constant surveillance on Cybertron. 
ANGLE ON IRONHIDE 
He peers into a monitor. As he speaks, we see the monitor PAN to an area where a huge Decepticon Symbol is emblazoned on Cybertron. 
IRONHIDE Every time I look into this thing, my circuits sizzle. I'm tired of this waiting game, Prime. When are we gonna start bustin' Deceptichops? 
ANGLE ON OPTIMUS PRIME 
He stands over a holographic map which shows various invasion plans for Cybertron. 
OPTIMUS PRIME We still don't have enough Energon cubes to power a full scale assault, Ironhide. 
IRONHIDE Then let me make another run to Autobot City on Earth. I'll bring you back more cubes than you'll know what to do with. 
ANGLE ON PRIME 
He solemnly hands down an order 
PRIME Alright, ready the shuttle for launch. 
ANGLE ON IRONHIDE 
He raises a fist in a warwhoop! 
IRONHIDE YAHOO! (looking into monitor) Your days are numbered now Decepticreeps. 
A SMALL MOON "MOUNTAIN" 
Ironhide transforms and Races toward a mountain, which stands about a half mile from the secret Autobot facility. 
OPTIMUS PRIME (V.O.) Jazz,    report security status. 
COMMAND CENTER - ANGLE ON THE CONSOLES 
JAZZ No sign of Decepticons in this sector, Prime. 
PRIME What about Moon Base 2? 
JAZZ Jazz to Moon Base 2. 
PAN UP   and through the sky to - 
ANOTHER MOON This is the second moon. It is much closer to Cybertron than the first one. This is where Bumblebee and Spike are stationed. 
JAZZ (V.O.) Jazz to Moon Base 2.

MEGATRON Soundwave!     Jam that transmission. 
ON SOUNDWAVE SOUNDWAVE moves forward and starts heaving CASSETTES upwards toward Blaster's Crows Nest position. 
SOUNDWAVE Rumble! Frenzy! Ravage! Ratbat! Eject! Operation: interference. 
ON CASSETTES as they transform and attack the crows nest. 
ON RUMBLE as he starts PILE DRIVER MOTION on Crows Nest windows 
RUMBLE First we crack the shell.    Then we crack the nuts inside. 
INSIDE CROWS NEST 
as Blaster and Perceptor see Rumble and others and react. Blaster stops broadcasting. 
BLASTER We got Cassette Critters knockin' on the window! 
ON RUMBLE as he CRACKS THROUGH GLASS and he and others swarm in and attack Perceptor who tries to beat them away 
PERCEPTOR Run, Blaster! Save yourself! 
BLASTER No way. Two can play! 
ON BLASTER as he spews out CASSETTES which TRANSFORM into CUBBIE, a lion, STRIPES, a tiger, STINGER, a scorpion and BOLTS, a small, tough robot. 
BLASTER Sic 'em!

ON RUMBLE as Cubbie takes him down by the foot, turning him over and over 
ON STRIPES as he SNAPS at Ratbat who screams and darts, trying to escape as we move to 
STINGER AND BOLTS 
as Bolts swats Frenzy into Stinger who JABS Stinger into Frenzy making him yowl and run. 
PERCEPTOR AND BLASTER 
As they fight Decepticons. 
PERCEPTOR You think you got through to Prime? 
BLASTER Let's hope so! Cause if I didn't we're gonna look like burnt out toaster ovens! 
CUT TO: 
LONG SHOT -AUTOBOT CITY BESIEGED 
The city shows gaps, dents, smoking holes and Decepticons continue to pump fire into it and get back sporadic return fire from inside as... ... Megatron moves INTO SHOT and fills THE SCREEN 
MEGATRON Constructicons merge for the kill! 
IN "PILLBOX" LIKE   GUN EMPLACEMENT IN CITY'S ARMORED WALL 
Where Springer and Arcee clear the twisted remains of Autobot defenders away from a CATAPULT LIKE TORPEDO LAUNCHER. 
POV - THROUGH LAUNCHER PORT 
we see the mountain where the Decepticons are getting ready for the final charge. 
SPRINGER Great! Megatron's making his big push and we can't even push... (struggling to turn Catapult around to re-aim it) ...back! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Arcee starts to push beside him. 
THE HUGE CATAPULT 
moves slowly as we CHANGE ANGLE and Kup, Hot Rod and Daniel ENTER SHOT. 
KUP Keep at it, Springer, lad! Help's at hand! (to Hot Rod) Together now! 
Hot Rod joins the others in pushing the huge Catapult into firing position. 
DANIEL also leans against it, his small legs churning. 
THE CATAPULT starts moving easily now. 
ON ARCEE BESIDE HOT ROD 
Pushing on the busted catapult. 
ARCEE (pushing, manages to speak to Hot Rod. She likes him but doesn't want to go too far) I was afraid you'd be trapped outside the city walls. 
MEGATRON Prime!? 
PRIME smashing through a wall of lesser Decepticons. 
PRIME One shall stand, one shall fall. 
CLOSE ON MEGATRON 
his eyes blazing with hatred. 
MEGATRON Why throw away your life so recklessly? 
ON OPTIMUS PRIME 
Dirge takes a sneaky leap at him... Optimus stiffarms him with a shuddering clank... ...then turns him upside down with one hand and... ...drives him headfirst into the rocky ground, letting him crumple and fall. 
OPTIMUS PRIME That's a question you should ask yourself. 
MEGATRON hurls himself at Optimus Prime... .... both tumble into the walls of the City... ...denting the walls and causing the electronic panels inside to short circuit, surrounding them with a fiery nimbus of crackling electrical energy. 
Ultra Magnus in car carrier mode barrels out of city carrying several Autobots. He and the others transform into robot mode and fire lasers at the Decepticons. 
INTERCUT TO HOT ROD, KUP, DANIEL, ARCEE, BLASTER, PERCEPTOR, 
fighting their way to the battle of the titans. 
HOT ROD We've got to save Prime! Punching... 
KUP That's his fight, lad!   Stay away. Shooting.. 
...And charging. 
ANGLE ON OPTIMUS AND MEGATRON 
Megatron attempts to kick Prime in the throat... ...Prime catches his foot, twists it... ... and hurls Megatron backwards into a metal pile. 
MEGATRON grabs a jagged, spearlike piece of steel and hurls it at 
PRIME The steel "spear" pierces his side and sticks in him as... ... he charges Megatron, ...dodging shots from Megatron's gun to... ...deliver a huge UPPERCUT which... ...lifts Megatron into the air so high that... ... (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: PRIME (CONT'D) his head butts sharply against overhanging concrete balcony, mashing him down... 
MEGATRON lands and stealthily slips a laser dagger from his boot, turning and slashing at... 
PRIME as he comes for him, tearing... ...a gash across Prime's midsection, which spews smoke and sparks and... 
... dropping Prime to one knee. 
MEGATRON (gloating) Farewell, Prime! 
As Megatron hurls the laser dagger as we CHANGE ANGLE to - 
OPTIMUS PRIME as he lifts chunks of broken concrete and catches the laser dagger on it, tossing it aside as he lunges at- 
MEGATRON who claws his fingers and digs them into Prime's eyes 
MEGATRON I'll rip out your optics! Optimus grabs Megatron's clawed hand in one of his hands, twists it in see-sawing test of strength which... Optimus wins in a judo toss which sends Megatron - - skidding face first through steel rubble, in a shower of sparks until he crashes into the side of the city. 
ANGLE ON HOT ROD 
He dispatches a Decepticon and turns to Prime. 
HOT ROD That's showing him, Optimus! 
KUP knocks two Decepticons on their tails and turns. 
KUP Finish him off, Prime!   Do it now! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
ON MEGATRON as he spots a gun on the ground ahead of him 
MEGATRON No more, Optimus Prime!    Grant me mercy, I beg of you! 
ANOTHER ANGLE FEATURING OPTIMUS PRIME AND HOT ROD 
as Optimus Prime warily moves out to look down at the cowering Megatron, keeping him in his gun sights. 
OPTIMUS PRIME You who are without mercy now plead for it. I thought you were made of sterner stuff, Megatron! 
ON HOT ROD 
as he sees Megatron go for the gun and leaps out to grapple with him 
PRIME Out of the way, Hot Rod. 
MEGATRON AND HOT ROD 
as Hot Rod grabs for the Blaster - - Megatron quickly gets Hot Rod in a headlock and using Hot Rod as a shield, gets the gun and... 
BLASTS PRIME IN THE WOUND HE'D MADE WITH HIS LASER DAGGER 
as he steps forward unwillingly, mixed grief and surprise on his face 
MAGNUS Prime, I'm just a soldier.   I'm not worthy. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
OPTIMUS PRIME (gasping) Nor was I, but one day, an Autobot shall rise from our ranks and use the powers of the Matrix to light our darkest hour. 
TIGHT SHOT - ULTRA MAGNUS AND OPTIMUS PRIME 
Optimus Prime is tilted into half sitting position by other Autobots manipulating the platform as Ultra Magnus grasps his hand with great emotion 
OPTIMUS PRIME (voice failing, pressing on with it) Until that day... 
Until all are one... Continue the struggle... (sags, gasps, hanging on) Transfer the Matrix of Leadership. 
TIGHTEN SHOT ON ULTRA MAGNUS AND OPTIMUS PRIME 
A distraught Ultra Magnus nods, reaches out with free hand and points his forefinger at Optimus Prime's chest. Then, pressing a button on Prime's chest, a small, secret doorway opens, and we see something extremely bright glowing in there. Ultra Magnus, nearly blinded by the intense light, reaches in, and lifts out -- 
THE AUTOBOT LEADERSHIP MATRIX, 
-- and holds it for a moment in his hand. 
ANGLE ON ALL 
The bright light, which emanates from the perfect crystal, seems to blind everybody and washes all color out of the shot. Then, slowly, Ultra Magnus moves it into his own chest, closes the door, and the light is gone, save for a momentary, and extremely powerful glow from his eyes. 
ON KUP, HOT ROD, ARCEE AND PERCEPTOR 
They are all full of great sorrow. 
ON PRIME - HE DIES 
All of his lights go out, including his eyes. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
UNICRON 
Rotating satellite dishes on the surface spark with electricity. Dissolve inside Unicron to reveal scenes of Prime's death and the passing of the Matrix to Ultra Magnus playing on various monitors. Some of the scenes are in slow motion, others are sped up. The effect should be eerie. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. ASTROTRAIN 
As it whizzes through the Solar System. 
ASTROTRAIN Jettison some weight, or I'll never make it to Cybertron. 
INT. ASTROTRAIN 
The ship is packed with living, dead and wounded Decepticons. Starscream addresses them like an Athenian Orator. 
STARSCREAM Fellow Decepticons, Astrotrain has requested that we lighten our burden! 
ANGLE ON BONECRUSHER 
BONECRUSHER In that case, I say it's survival of the fittest. 
STARSCREAM So I hear a second on that? 
ASSORTED SHOTS 
HEALTHY DECEPTICONS Aye! 
STARSCREAM And against? 
NOT HEALTHY DECEPTICONS (WEAKLY) 
NAY! 
STARSCREAM The ayes' have it! 
A robotic hand flips a switch, and chaos ensues. Strong Decepticons start heave-hoing the weaker ones out into space. 
DECEPTICONS 
(AD LIB) Beat it!     Spare me! 
ANGLE ON STARSCREAM AND MEGATRON 
Starscream picks him up and holds him up by the door. 
STARSCREAM (sarcastic) Oh, how it grieves me to do this. 
MEGATRON Wait, I still function! 
Starscream kicks him out. 
STARSCREAM Wanna bet? 
CONTINUED: 
UNICRON Your bargaining posture is highly dubious, but very well, I will provide you with a new body, and new troops to command. 
MEGATRON And... 
UNICRON And nothing. 
You belong to me now. 
MEGATRON I belong to nobody. 
UNICRON Perhaps I misjudged you. Proceed on your way to oblivion. The Mist appears and starts to dissolve Megatron. 
MEGATRON (pleading) No, no. I accept your terms.   I accept! 
UNICRON Excellent! Behold - Galvatron! X-ray images: wiring, circuitry, etc. flash on and off as a new and larger being starts to form, changing from dented Megatron to a huge, new creation: Galvatron. 
THE TRANSFORMATION - CREATION 
ends in a blinding flash and Galvatron - who still resembles Megatron - laughs and flexes his muscles and stretches. His voice is deeper, different from Megatron's 
GALVATRON Long live Galvatron! 
UNICRON And these shall be your minions... 
ANGLE ON OTHER DECEPTICONS 
Their bodies are turned from battered Decepticons to... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
SCOURGE SCOURGE (Sweep character) is bearded, fanged and ferocious looking and as soon as he has been CREATED, he roars and stretches and an ARRAY OF SIMILAR CREATURES - smaller and all wearing dark and matching uniforms - are INSTANTLY CREATED FROM OTHERS behind him 
UNICRON Scourge, the tracker....and his huntsmen...the Sweeps.... 
ON CYCLONUS   (NEW DECEPTICON WITH PLANE TRANSFORM ABILITY) 
CYCLONUS is CREATED and then his "armada" of similar, but smaller and similarly colored and clad creatures are formed. 
UNICRON Cyclonus, the warrior...and his armada..... 
ANGLE FEATURING GALVATRON 
GALVATRON To Cybertron! 
He roars with a mad power-rush, gets into Cyclonus (who will be his personal ship) and leading the armada, takes off for the distant stars. 
UNICRON (loudly proclaiming over the scene) Bring me the Autobot matrix! DURING UNICRON'S COMMAND we CHANGE ANGLE TO SHOW 
LONG SHOT OF UNICRON 
as Galvatron and his newly created force FLY UP AND AWAY with great speed. 
GALVATRON I will rip open Autobot after Autobot until it is yours, Unicron. 
CUT TO: 
THE DECEPTICON HALL OF HEROES - STARSCREAM 
This is the closest thing the Decepticons have to a throne room. It is a massive, circular room with tombs of old leaders, and a raised area where Starscream stands. 
STARSCREAM AND OTHERS 
The Decepticon plane looks slightly ridiculous with cloak on his shoulders and Thrust and Ramjet at his side, weapons held high, but ready for action should anybody question Starscream's rule. In front of him stands Astrotrain holding a huge Metallic CROWN over his head. 
OTHER DECEPTICONS in neat ranks but their grim expressions show their displeasure. 
STARSCREAM (preening) Get on with the ceremony! Dirge and others react to EERIE SOUNDS and look up and off. Starscream looks where others are looking and reacts. 
HIS P.O.V. - GALVATRON AND HIS FORCES 
as they descend in Hall of Heroes and Galvatron moves out to confront Starscream 
ON STARSCREAM AND GALVATRON 
STARSCREAM Who disrupts my coronation? 
GALVATRON Coronation? This is bad comedy! 
STARSCREAM Megatron, is that you? 
GALVATRON Here's a clue! 
HIS P.O.V -GALVATRON 
as Galvatron transforms into cannon, FIRING A HUGE BURST ON STARSCREAM as BLAST hits him. For a moment, he retains his shape then piece by piece, he falls apart. Only a pair of boots remain on the floor. 
GALVATRON He transforms back to robot mode and confronts other Decepticons boastfully. 
GALVATRON Will anyone else attempt to fill his shoes? 
SOUNDS of torrential winds, quakes, etc as moon is quickly becoming Unicron's lunch. 
JAZZ (V.O.) Hit it! 
ON ESCAPE POD 
as it BLASTS OFF and away from Unicron with an EXPLOSION. For a moment, it looks like they are going to get clean away, but... 
ANOTHER ANGLE Suddenly it is pulled deep into Unicron. 
ANOTHER ANGLE - THE MOON 
as Moon shatters like a hollow egg and is sucked completely into Unicron's maw which closes around it with a snap. 
CUT TO: 
GALVATRON IN DECEPTICON HALL OF HEROES 
Silence. No more winds. No more movement. 
GALVATRON How dare Unicron?! (defiant) Cybertron and all it's moons are mine! 
ANOTHER ANGLE ON GALVATRON 
His body starts to twist making him writhe in pain powerless to resist 
SCOURGE But remember, WE belong to HIM! 
GALVATRON (gasping for breath, writhing, nods) I....will obey, Unicron! Decepticons, to Earth! The torture stops and Galvatron clutches his throat and tries to regain his composure as we... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. AUTOBOT CITY -- ULTRA MAGNUS 
He has a portable communication device. Spike and Bumble can be seen on it. Springer, Kup, the Dinobots, Blurr, and Hot Rod look on amid general gathering of Autobots. Arcee holds Daniel up on her shoulder so he can see. Blaster is in b.g. 
SPIKE It's like a terrible nightmare, Ultra Magnus. 
BUMBLEBEE This thing - this juggernaut just ripped the first moon to shreds. 
SPIKE And it's heading this way. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BUMBLEBEE We'll try 'n slow it down... 
SPIKE But you'd better get here fast because... Suddenly, static obscures the transmission. 
DANIEL Dad! 
ULTRA MAGNUS Autobots, prepare to board the shuttles. This new menace is more dangerous than all the Decepticons put together. Somehow we must destroy it before it devours Cybertron. 
DANIEL But what about my dad? He's on the moon between that monster and Cybertron. 
ULTRA MAGNUS Daniel, I'll do everything I can for Spike. 
HOT ROD And what are we going to do when we get there? If that thing crunches moons, it'll make short work of us. 
ULTRA MAGNUS Maybe the Matrix can stop it. 
HOT ROD You're right! It can. 
KUP What do you know about it lad? 
HOT ROD It's just a feeling. 
Hot Rod looks up and sees something. 
KUP Look! 
THE AUTOBOTS TURN TO SEE 
POV - ANGLE ON ATTACKING DECEPTICONS 
Decepticon ships seem to dive from nowhere to attack the Autobots. 
ULTRA MAGNUS To the shuttles!!! 
ANGLE ON DECEPTICON JETS 
Galvatron is in the lead. 
GALVATRON There is no escape. I, Galvatron will crush you just as the magnificent Megatron crushed Prime! 
ULTRA MAGNUS And you'll die trying just like Megatron! Ultra Magnus fires Laser and hits Galvatron. 
GALVATRON aaaaaaaah!     Autobot cur!! 
CYCLONUS You want me to gut Ultra Magnus for you? 
GALVATRON There are plenty of Autobots for you. Ultra Magnus is mine! 
SPRINGER (to Daniel) Looks like we're shipmates, squirt! 
DANIEL All right! 
SPRINGER But if you get space sick, you're gonna walk home. 
ANOTHER ANGLE FEATURING ULTRA MAGNUS AND PERCEPTOR 
ULTRA MAGNUS Hurry! 
Blurr blurs up ramp. Arcee reaches the ramp as the shuttle takes off horizontally. 
ON BOARD THE SHUTTLE- ANGLE ON SPRINGER 
as he reaches down for Arcee.

SPRINGER Jump. 
ON ARCEE still going up the ramp while the shuttle slowly leaves the ground. 
Just as the wind and gravity are about to knock her off, she jumps up and... 
INSIDE THE SHUTTLE 
Springer grabs her hand and pulls her in, narrowly avoiding a barrage Daniel is watching, terrified. 
DANIEL That was close! 
Concussion of Decepticon hit rocks the shuttle 
SPRINGER Believe it or not, this is the fun part. 
IN "COCKPIT" OF ULTRA MAGNUS' SHUTTLE 
Ultra Magnus is at control deck with Perceptor as they "taxi" for launch and we see oncoming Decepticon jets firing at them 
ULTRA MAGNUS No time to preheat....Can this ship take it? 
PERCEPTOR With an accelerated ignition procedure the ceramic housings might create a magnetic flux. 
ULTRA MAGNUS (baffled) What? 
SPRINGER (ENTERING SHOT, reaches in and pushes joystick forward) He says "go for it!" 
Powerful rockets ignite, and the shuttle   SHAKES with the sound. 
ANGLE ON RUNWAY 
The Shuttle's rockets surge, melting the pursuing    Sweeps as the Shuttle hits the sky and soars upwards. 
ON DINOBOT SHUTTLE 
Cyclonus' Jets fire on it, as we CHANGE ANGLE ON ULTRA MAGNUS' SHUTTLE It roars up behind Cyclonus' jets and overtakes and smashes through them, scattering them as it pulls up alongside the Dinobot shuttle 
INT. DINOBOT SHUTTLE- KUP AND HOT ROD IN "COCKPIT" 
Grimlock is peering out of the side ports. 
HOT ROD gives the thumbs up gesture. 
ANOTHER ANGLE INCLUDING Ultra Magnus' shuttle through side port as Springer gives thumbs up signal in return and Daniel waves 
ON SPRINGER as he turns and reacts, looking straight up and ahead 
SPRINGER It ought to be smooth sailin' from here on in. 
ON ASTROTRAIN AND DECEPTICON JETS 
ASTROTRAIN Fuse them! 
Astrotrain starts diving into upcoming Shuttles BLASTING AWAY.

ANGLE ON GALVATRON'S CARRIER 
Particularly deadly looking missiles shoot out. 
ANGLE ON THE DINOBOT SHUTTLE 
It zooms towards a whopper of a planet, surrounded by several small moons. We will later learn that this planet is Quintesson, but for now, it's mysterious. The moleculon missiles streak after it like sidewinders. 
INT. THE DINOBOT SHUTTLE 
Kup and Hot Rod pilot the thing for all it's worth. 
HOT ROD They're closing on us! 
KUP Yep, like the shrikebats of Dromedon! 
HOT ROD Yeah, how'd you beat them? 
KUP I'm trying to remember...there were an awful lot of casualties that day...

KUP (O.S.) Oh yeah, we inversed polarities. 
HOT ROD (O.S.) That'll tear the ship apart! 
KUP (O.S.) You got a better idea?!! With that, the ship seems to stop, on a dime, in mid air! The missiles zoom past it. 
INT. THE SHIP (KUP AND HOT ROD) 
Hot Rod watches wide-eyed, as Kup watches ahead warily, hands on the controls. 
HOT ROD Okay, so you were right. 
KUP Don't run your programs until they're debugged. 
ANGLE OUT THE VIEWSCREEN 
Suddenly, the moleculon missiles, reverse course and start coming back. 
HOT ROD They're coming back.

as Hot Rod falls into the sea, we CUT TO THE SILVERY ENERGY SEA Hot Rod sinks to the bottom where he collides with... ... a metallic reef, bounces, manages to right himself, shaking his head as he regains equilibrium, and... Then he transforms into auto mode modified for undersea action and starts riding off as he calls through intercom. 
HOT ROD (bubbling, filtered voice) Kup....Grimlock?   Slag!....Anybody? WE FOLLOW him through undersea world as he rounds a "corner" of the Reef Wall and reacts

HOT ROD Fires at the Squid, but not stopping him. 
ANOTHER ANGLE Hot Rod's shot plinks off a couple of tentacles, but the squid keeps coming... 
... Wraps his tentacles around Hot Rod and starts crushing... ... Hot Rod looks like he's about to be crushed, but he... ... Shoots ... Its hideous Optical Sensor. 
THE SQUID releases a laser print ink stream which boils out in the water in a series of dots and "x" shapes and retreats. 
HOT ROD Don't worry, I'm not coming after you.

CUT TO: 
KUP AND HOT ROD ON THE RED DESERT SHORE OF THE ENERGY SEA 
Kup stands impatiently while Hot Rod reassembles them. 
HOT ROD Well...what do you think? Kup feels his elbow joint, twists his neck side to side and gets creaks and squeaks and moves legs in odd, creaky way as he is trying himself out. 
KUP (a beat, then grimaces) There's a piece missing. 
HOT ROD No way.... (sifts through pile of SCRAP METAL PARTS lying at Kup's feet) See, this wasn't yours...it's some kind of prehistoric ion cruncher....and this doohickey looks like a funky energon funnel... and this...

HOT ROD (brightening) Really? 
KUP (rotates arm rapidly) Yeah, you even got rid of a nasty burr on my rotator! Now, let's find the Dinos and get off this twisted planet! 
ON KUP as he transforms it's evident that a fender is misplaced and a wheel mounted improperly so it wobbles and he rides unevenly with much chugging and oil spewing 
KUP (V.O.) (in vehicular mode) Of all the circuit glitched diode blowin' dim-wittery... I told you a part was missin'.

DISSOLVE TO: 
ANOTHER PART OF QUINTESSON 
Kup and Hot Rod walk along a swampy, marshy area. Suddenly, there are several loud gurgles, and we can see the shapes of something terrible emerging through the muck. Hot Rod spins to fire, but Kup bats down his arm. 
PAN TO SHOW

Jury's faces rotate to fifth expression - a DEATH'S HEAD ON GRANIX   {NOTE: Yet another, final, reference to Kranix as Granix} Suddenly, the Robot is dumped into a pit of teeming Sharkticons and there is a mad frenzy. In moments, he is no more. 
ANGLE ON KUP 
He watches grimly through the bars. 
KUP Not the end I'd wish for, lad. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
THE EDGE OF A HUGE, SHADOWY PLANET IN SPACE 
as Ultra Magnus' Shuttle is BUFFETED BY WINDS AND STORMS as it enters the atmosphere of JUNKION. 
INT. THE SHUTTLE 
as it SHAKES AND RATTLES VIOLENTLY 
DANIEL Where are we, Springer? 
SPRINGER The place where everything ends up after you throw it out. 
TIGHT ON BLURR 
as he holds up hands and CROSSES fingers. 
RESUME ON SPRINGER 
Tenses and crouches protectively around Arcee and Daniel as we see mountains of junk whizz past the window. 
ULTRA MAGNUS Brace for impact! 
ON SHUTTLE - TRACKING 
It plummets through the mountains and canyons of junk, narrowly avoiding crashing, but frequently hitting junk pinnacles or sides of junk walls, and causing avalanches of junk. By the time the ship lands, it is nearly indistinguishable from the junk. 
INT. THE SHUTTLE 
Everyone is in a jumbled tangle - Ultra Magnus beneath Blurr, Perceptor upside down and hanging from torn end of stairway, Arcee crouched over Daniel and Springer with half his body sticking through the hull 
SPRINGER (pulling himself free of hull wall) Remind me to give the Auto Pilot a raise... Daniel creeps out from under Arcee and shakes bits of broken metal and dust off his shoulders 
DANIEL Wow! That was better'n the Roller Coaster at Future World! 
PERCEPTOR (working scanner, computer device, thoughtfully) The composition of this planet seems to be a chaotic amalgam of discarded ferrous and non-ferrous articulations. 
ULTRA MAGNUS (baffled) How's that? 
SPRINGER (opening hull door with a RIPPING OF METAL) He says the planet's made of junk. 
SPRINGER AND PERCEPTOR AT OPEN DOOR 
as they look out on landscape of "living" junk 
SPRINGER Yep, this dump is a dump...... 
ULTRA MAGNUS as he straps on TOOL BELT 
ULTRA MAGNUS We might be able to salvage this thing. (checks LASER DRILL, turns it on, off) Ultra Magnus starts for door followed by Blurr who takes up a saw and tool belt and Perceptor who rolls up Shuttle Plans as Daniel moves out to join them 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
DANIEL Can I help, too? 
SPRINGER It's rough out there, kid. Stay inside and play with crayons or something. 
With that, the four Dinobots head towards the "primrose path." 
ANGLE ON THE QUINTESSON 
His head rotates and he smiles a sinister, evil smile. 
EXT. UNICRON 
Galvatron stands upon the demonic planet, in an extremely contorted position. 
GALVATRON Why do you torture me?! 
VARIOUS ANGLES ON UNICRON 
We have no idea where this godly voice is coming from, but this place sure is spooky. 
UNICRON You have failed. 
GALVATRON No, Unicron. Ultra Magnus is dead. 
UNICRON Then where is the matrix? 
GALVATRON Destroyed, with him. 
UNICRON The matrix can not be destroyed. (pause) And Ultra Magnus lives on the planet of Junk. Stalk him. Cut him open! And bring the matrix to me. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. THE PRIMROSE PATH 
They step along the primrose path, not noticing as sinister things start to happen all around them. 
ANGLE ON A METAL EATING PLANT 
This thing looks like a metal version of a "venus fly trap," and it has a malevolent red eye which lights up. Swoop walks past it in humanoid mode. 
SNAP! 
It misses him by an inch. 
GRIMLOCK Me Grimlock, positive Hot Rod and Kup close! Get thump, thump, thump... (taps his head hard) 
ANGLE ON THE GROUND - IN FRONT OF SLAG 
Suddenly, a section of stones drop away in front of Slag revealing a spiked pit... 
SLAG Me, Slag say you are full of beryllium balony. He is just about to fall in when... 
ANGLE ON GRIMLOCK AND SLAG 
Grimlock, in dino mode, slaps him with his tail, knocking him away an instant before he steps into the hole... 
GRIMLOCK Me, Grimlock, say you full of cesium salami! Slag gets up... 
SLAG Beryllium balony! 
GRIMLOCK Argh! 
ANGLE ON GRIMLOCK 
He is about to pounce on Slag when a massive tree, which is actually more like a sword, suddenly is spring and arcs toward him. The machete like blade strikes the ground, between Grimlock and Slag narrowly missing them. He turns and sees the thing stocking in the ground. 
GRIMLOCK Me, Grimlock think trees here are cheap model. 
SLAG Like your head! (laughs at own joke) Grimlock jumps on Slag and wrestles him to the ground. Suddenly, a SQUEAKY, ODDLY CHILDISH VOICE speaks from o.s. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
SQUEAKY VOICE (WHEELIE) Friends find. Look behind. 
GRIMLOCK (furious) Who say that? 
HIS P.O.V. - WHEELIE 
WHEELIE is the Wolf Boy of Quintesson - an Autobot who's been evading the Sharkticons since his parents' ship crashed, killing everybody else in his party. He wears a necklace of Sharkticon teeth, packs a three bladed laser knife and a special SLING which hurls FIRE STONES. He fears nothing, especially the Dinobots, and he cockily struts into the clear... ... walks right up Sludge's tail onto Sludge's back and then shinnies up his neck and jumps onto... ... Slag's head where he stands eye to eye with Grimlock 
WHEELIE Friends find. Look behind.   Many Face lie. You fool! You buy! 
GRIMLOCK AND WHEELIE 
GRIMLOCK (eyes blaze, furious) Me, Grimlock, "fool?" 
WHEELIE (smiling breezily) Picture you got. Now fool you not! (he laughs in a wild, metallic cackle) Grimlock raises a claw to swipe Wheelie off Slag's head 
GRIMLOCK Me, Grimlock, no like you! 
ON WHEELIE as he scowls and quickly loads FIRESTONE IN SLING and slings it onto Grimlock's nose where it EXPLODES making Grimlock yowl and pull back, feeling his reddened nose and speaking through his nose angrily 
GRIMLOCK (continuing) Doooooooow! Why boy hit by dose? 
(CONTINUED) 
They charge Kup and Hot Rod Kup and Hot Rod fire into them, destroying several, but are.... ... Soon overrun. The Sharkticons crawl all over them, munching on their metal. 
SUDDENLY -- 
DINOBOTS (O.S.) (WAR WHOOP) 
ANGLE ON THE DINOBOTS 
They fly down and land on the pile, transforming into Dinobot mode. 
ASSORTED SHOTS OF DINOBOT CARNAGE 
SLUDGE in brontosaurus mode, swats several around with his tail, while stomping them with his feet. 
GRIMLOCK Lowers his teeth to devour a much smaller Sharkticon, the Sharkticon bares his teeth, realizes that he's a second stringer, and scampers away. 
GRIMLOCK Me Grimlock want to munch metal! Slag barrels into Sharkticons, making a quick shishkebob out of them, while... 
Swoop picks two up with his claws, flies in the air and drops them on other Sharkticons. 
THE SHARKTICONS suddenly back off and begin transforming (bowing) to the dinobots. 
ANGLE ON ALL 
Kup and Hot Rod dig themselves out of a pile of Sharkticon parts. 
HOT ROD I never thought I'd be so happy to see those big bozos. 
ANGLE ON GRIMLOCK 
He turns to Hot Rod. 
GRIMLOCK Me Grimlock no bozo.   Me king! 
ANGLE ON QUINTESSON JUDGES 
They look down, their angry faces showing. 
QUINTESSON JUDGE Sharkticons! Execute them. 
ANGLE ON GRIMLOCK 
He points to the Quintessons... 
GRIMLOCK Me Grimlock say execute them. 
THE SHARKTICONS for a brief instant, don't seem to know what to do. Then, they charge the Quintessons. 
THE CHASE The Quintessons start to flee, but it's clear that the Sharkticons, who climb over the stacked bodies of other Sharkticons, are going to catch them. 
KUP I think the problems on this planet will be solved very shortly. 
ON HOT ROD 
HOT ROD But what about our problems.    We need a ship. 
WHEELIE WHEELIE You get a ship if I get a trip. 
ANGLE ON HOT ROD 
He turns to the little, feral, robot. 
HOT ROD Who are you. 
SLAG AND WHEELIE 
The dinobot lifts up Wheelie. 
SLAG Him Wheelie, him friend. 
HOT ROD HOT ROD He'll be mine too, if he can find a Quintesson ship. 
ANGLE ON WHEELIE 
He points into the distance... 
WHAT WE SEE 
is the strangest looking corkscrew ship   we've every seen sticking out of the ground. 
HOT ROD That's a ship? 
EXT. THE SECOND MOON OF CYBERTRON 
PAN ACROSS an enormous stockpile of weaponry as we hear the terrible roar we have come to associate with Unicron. 
SPIKE If this doesn't do it, nothing will. 
ANGLE ON SPIKE 
He sets a timer to 20 seconds.   The L.E.D. clicks down. 
BUMBLEBEE now with a new bumpersticker which is a Unicron with a red circle and slash through it, looks very fidgety. 
WRECK-GAR Forward, avanti, apfel and like, go for gusto.... (stops as OMINOUS ROAR comes from overhead and he looks up) 
HIS P.O.V. - GALVATRON AND HUGE DECEPTICON FORCE 
WRECK-GAR (V.O.) Hang on, this be industrial strength We watch... 
ULTRA MAGNUS as he, too, hears and then looks up and sees the Decepticon force 
ULTRA MAGNUS Decepticons! (to Springer) We've got to draw them off and then double back to the ship! 
ANGLE ON CYCLONUS 
with Galvatron piloting, races up and launches a particularly nasty looking missile which streaks INTO SHOT and... 
ANGLE ON ULTRA MAGNUS' SHIP 
... BLAMMOLA!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Turns it into junk. Springer FIRES UP at INCOMING JETS, calling to the others 
SPRINGER Cancel that last order. 
ON ARCEE, DANIEL, BLURR 
as Arcee transforms and moves off in one direction.   Daniel looks at Blurr who is starting to transform 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
DANIEL What do I do? 
BLURR Transform! You can do... (TRANSFORMATION complete, he blurs off and, in V.O. adds) ...it! 
Blurr GOES OFF outblurring past HAIL OF LASER FIRE from Ramjet scorching by overhead 
ON DANIEL as he reacts, looks around, thinks, brows knitting, looking off, reacting 
DANIEL Transform.... 
HIS P.O.V.- SCAVENGER 
Coming at him from one side, Shrapnel coming from the other side 
ON SCAVENGER as he starts reaching for Daniel 
SCAVENGER Human germ! 
ON DANIEL as his Exo-Suit SUDDENLY TRANSFORMS INTO auto mode and takes off and drives through... 
...SCAVENGER AND SHRAPNEL, knocking them over. 
DANIEL (V.O.) Wooooh!! 
GALVATRON flies up to a ridge in advance of his forces, motioning to them to split off and follow... 
EXT. JUNKION - THE CHASE 
BIRD'S EYE VIEW - THE AUTOBOTS

ANGLE ON PERCEPTOR AND ULTRA MAGNUS 
... Perceptor lies on the ground, stunned. ...     Ultra Magnus stops next to him... 
ULTRA MAGNUS Perceptor! 
... Suddenly, shots tear into the junk all around them as... 
ANGLE ON A SWEEP 
ROARS towards them... 
ANGLE ON PERCEPTOR

ON PERCEPTOR He transforms to humanoid mode.

ULTRA MAGNUS Then move it... 
ANGLE ON GALVATRON 
He holds the Autobot Matrix. 
(CONTINUED)

GALVATRON Unicron, my "master," with this I shall make you my slave! 
Galvatron gets into Cyclonus and flies off 
DISSOLVE TO: 
DANIEL as he moves out and looks down at Ultra Magnus' remains 
DANIEL (tearful) Ultra Magnus! 
ANOTHER ANGLE - BLURR, SPRINGER, ARCEE AND PERCEPTOR 
as they move up beside Daniel. 
BLURR Without the Matrix there is no hope.   No hope at all! 
WRECK-GAR AND AN ARMY OF JUNKIONS 
as they are moving in battle array towards the Shuttle. Junkions are an interesting species. They ride themselves. That is, the Junkions ride transforms of themselves, so that if their vehicle breaks down, the driver will become the vehicle, and the vehicle will transform to become the driver. They are gibbering, singing almost a wild kind of junk-rock, war-cry song which, like their language, is constructed of bits and pieces of the museum junk of our culture - a humorous aggressive song which makes a surreal kind of sense. "Slice 'em dice 'em... And that's all folks or your money back..." 
ON WRECK-GAR as he roars into the lead and shows his teeth 
WRECK-GAR Don't look behind door number two, Monty. It's time to play End-of-the-line-my valentine! Geroni-roni-doo-ron-ron-i-mo! (he charges) 
ON SPRINGER AND OUR FRIENDS 
as they react 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
SPRINGER Get gone! 
Springer leads the way and Blurr, Arcee, Daniel and Perceptor follow and we MOVE TO A ROAD WARRIOR STYLE CHASE as Springer and Arcee ride on either side of Daniel and Perceptor with Blurr bringing up the rear- - zig zagging back and forth to keep the Junkions from getting at Daniel. 
A JUNKION roars alongside Springer on his motorcycle and throws out laser barbed grappling hook, trying to hook Springer. Springer ducks first pass of hook. 
ON JUNKION as he hurls GRAPPLING HOOK AGAIN 
ON SPRINGER as he catches HOOK BY THE CHAIN AND YANKS IT 
THE JUNKION goes flying off his motorcycle.,, He transforms into a motorcycle as The motorcycle transforms into a rider and hops on the new motorcycle and then... 
...turns around to come back. 
ON SPRINGER He looks over, astonished. 
SPRINGER It's not hard to knock 'em down. It's getting them to stay down that's the trick. 
ON ARCEE as she fires at a Junkion who is trying to swerve her off the road knocking him off the motorcycle... The Junkion looks down at his missing arm, digs around in the junk for a minute, comes up with another, and then transforms to a motorcycle. 
ANOTHER ANGLE as Junkion rides over to her, starts belting her with junk sword 
ARCEE They're indestructible! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
ON DANIEL as he skids, stopping his Exo-Suit as he reacts to what's ahead 
DANIEL They're everywhere! 
HIS P.O.V. - PILES OF JUNK 
as Junkions arise out of every junk pile in sight and, gibbering, singing their junk-rock battle song, start moving in 
ON SPRINGER as he stops and Arcee, Daniel, Perceptor and Blurr stop around him. They close ranks and look out at the Junkions grimly 
PERCEPTOR Perhaps they're not as vicious as they look. 
ON WRECK-GAR as he gnashes his teeth and grins and then BLINKS HIS EYES which roll to show eyes like ping pong balls. Wreck-Gar makes blipping noises as he does this 
ON SPRINGER reacting to Wreck-Gar's noises and eyeball display 
SPRINGER (to Perceptor) Positive thinking gets    on my nerves. Suddenly, all react to    sound and wind of passing space cruiser    their P.O.V- HOT ROD, KUP AND DINOBOTS    IN CRUISER as it shoots past and banks,    coming back for a closer look 
SPRINGER (V.O.) It can't be....it's.....Hot Rod!     He's alive! 
DANIEL as he looks up at passing Cruiser and waves 
DANIEL And Kup and the Dinobots!    We're saved! 
(CONTINUED) 
He reaches into his body, and about where a heart or some other organ would be, he pulls out a Watchman. 
THE WATCHMAN On it is a crazy Eddy-type commercial. 
WRECK-GAR We talk T.V. You talk some T.V.? 
KUP looks around nervously. 
KUP I talk some TV. And now, Hot Rod for the news. Don't touch that dial. Void where prohibited. JUNKIONS cheer wildly while the Dinobots react with uncertainty 
RESUME ON WRECK-GAR 
as he points off and shouts happily. 
WRECK-GAR By George kimosabes your smashed up, blotto friend, soon like brand new with ninety day warranty all iciban parts and labor is! 
HIS P.O.V. - JUNKIONS WITH ULTRA MAGNUS 
The Junkions move Ultra Magnus' mangled body through an amazing assembly line, quickly piecing together his body parts, using junk when they can't find a part. Then, they lube him, dust him, spray him and polish him. Then, Wreck-Gar hits a switch, and Ultra Magnus' eye lights go on. 
WRECK-GAR Happy motoring! Cock-a-doodle-do! 
ON ULTRA MAGNUS 
as he steps away from Junkion line of reconstruction and into group consisting of Hot Rod, Kup and Springer. 
SPRINGER AND OTHERS (Ad lib jubilation) Ultra Magnus! 
ULTRA MAGNUS You're all alive... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
HOT ROD The matrix! 
All turn to Ultra Magnus. 
ULTRA MAGNUS It's gone... 
KUP And with it, all hope. 
HOT ROD No... (inspired) The matrix will not fail us. 
ARCEE Didn't you hear Ultra Magnus. We don't have it anymore. Galvatron does. 
HOT ROD Then we've got to trust in ourselves, and no matter what they odds, destroy Unicron. 
ON WRECK-GAR His eyes light up. 
WRECK-GAR Yeah! Destroy Unicron... Kill the grand poobah.... Flush cosmic troubles down the drain. 
ANGLE ON JUNKIONS 
JUNKIONS (almost chanting) Destroy Unicron... Kill the grand poobah... Flush cosmic troubles down the drain. 
ANGLE ON SPRINGER 
The Quintesson ship in the BACKGROUND. 
SPRINGER Listen,   I don't want to rain on anybody's parade,   but how are we going to move the army to   Unicron. We don't have enough room on   that ship. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
WRECK-GAR No fuss, no muss. (to others) Hurry, hurry. Sale must end! Rush right on down to bridge and test drive latest with no obligation. 
Suddenly, several Junkions scramble to concealed doorways in the Junk. 
ULTRA MAGNUS You have ships here? 
WRECK-GAR New, improved Junkion planet, is sleek sexy import with turbo handling. 
SPRINGER What's he talking about? 
ANGLE ON QUINTESSON 
Suddenly, boosters fire from the back side of the junk, and somewhere under all of the junk, we realize is a real space ship. Maybe the junk is the space ship. It takes off, bits and pieces of junk flying off as it moves. 
SPRINGER This is what I call traveling in style. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
LONG SHOT- UNICRON 
as Galvatron stands on the surface of Unicron, holding the Matrix. 
GALVATRON (V.O.) Listen to me, or suffer the consequences. 
UNICRON Aren't we getting pompous? 
GALVATRON I now possess that which you most fear. Unicron LAUGHS and the force of it rocks the surface of the planet, knocking Galvatron to his knees. 
Hot Rod steps towards Galvatron. 
GALVATRON It is strange that we should find ourselves as allies... 
ON GALVATRON Suddenly, his body is violently twisted, and his arms are almost broken off. 
GALVATRON Uhhhh... 
UNICRON Destroy him, or feel yourself torn from limb to limb. 
GALVATRON Of course, my master! 
ANGLE ON GALVATRON AND HOT ROD 
Galvatron takes a shot at Hot Rod. ... Hot Rod dives away, as electricity seems to flash everywhere. 
ON GALVATRON He peers into the gloom. 
GALVATRON'S POV   -   PANNING THE ROOM 
Hot Rod is nowhere to be seen amidst all of the junk. 
ON GALVATRON Weapon drawn. 
GALVATRON Puny Autobot, you lack even Prime's courage. There is no response. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SPACE - THE BATTLE 
ASSORTED SHOTS Unicron now stands atop Cybertron, fighting the various ships that swarm around him like bees. ... Rays streak from his one good eye. ... (MORE) (CONTINUED)

CUT TO: 
INT. THE CORRIDOR IN UNICRON -- SAME TIME 
Kup, Arcee, Springer and Daniel dash down the corridor. Suddenly, Daniel's foot is caught in a maze of wiring. 
ANGLE ON THE OTHERS 
Not noticing, they keep running. 
ANGLE ON DANIEL 
He tries to pull his foot out. No luck. Then, he looks up. 
WHAT HE SEES

ANGLE UNDER THE ANTIBODIES 
Daniel, unscathed by the things, which hover over his head, munching their way towards the Autobots, gets his foot free. 
DANIEL I'm okay.    They don't even see me.

It looks like Custer's last stand as they are surrounded by the vicious antibodies. 
CONTINUED: 
DANIEL I can't stop it!

Jazz drops in, then Bumblebee, then Spike. 
DANIEL turns around and sees this.

INT.   THE DARK CAVERN WITH GALVATRON AND HOT ROD 
Galvatron, the Matrix at his neck, stalks around the room. Looking everywhere for Hot Rod. 
GALVATRON Come out, Autobot. We all must die sometime. 
Suddenly, shockingly, Hot Rod jumps out of the floor and grabs Galvatron, sinking his fist into the Decepticon's face. 
GALVATRON stumbles backward.

... Galvatron wrestles him to his back.. ... The Adolescent Robot tries to fight back, but the other is stronger. ... Galvatron puts his hands around Hot Rod's neck and starts squeezing. ... We hear the crunching of metal. 
GALVATRON First Prime, then Ultra Magnus and now you. It is a pity Autobots die so easily or I might have a sense of satisfaction now. Hot Rod desperately gasps and pulls at Galvatron's hands... 
EXT. SPACE - THE BATTLE 
Unicron shoots down more Decepticons with his remaining eye, while he crushes the Junkion ship. 
INT. THE JUNKION SHIP 
The walls crush in.    The Junkions and the Autobots are   being smashed together. 
WRECK-GAR Ashes to ashes. Junk to junk. 
INT. THE DARK CAVERN

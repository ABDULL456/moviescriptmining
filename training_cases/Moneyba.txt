1 INT. OAKLAND COLISEUM - NIGHT 1 
Static shots: A deserted locker room. Empty showers. Cinder-block tunnels lit with wire-encased lamps like in a coal mine. THREE SECURITY GUARDS watch a game on a TV. LEGEND: October 15, 2001 
We begin to hear disembodied cheering crowds and the faint voice of an announcer - 
BRENNAMAN V/O ... nobody on, two and two to Saenz - who has just three at bats in the series, and none of them hits - as he settles back in 
2 EXT. OAKLAND COLISEUM -NIGHT 2 
At the end of a tunnel, the A's empty dugout. The empty diamond. Just a couple of the floodlights are on. 
BRENNAMAN V/O - Rivera looks in for the sign, he has it, the pitch, Saenz swings and - 
The announcer's voice and excited crowd abruptly cut off. In silence, we regard the 60,000 empty seats that wrap around the playing field ... but then see that, in fact, it's 59,999 empty seats. There's a lone figure seated in one of them. The sound snaps back on: 
STEVE LYONS V/O - a ground out to second, Thom, is not what the A's were looking for from Saenz - down by two in the ninth - 
The lone man in the stadium has a radio and a bag of peanuts. He seems at peace as he looks down on the empty diamond - a peace only slightly belied, perhaps, by the baseball he absently turns in a hand. He switches the radio back on - 
BRENNAMAN V/O Eric Byrnes has emerged from the dugout to bat for Menechino - 
He turns it off again. Calmly eats a peanut. Waits. Switches the radio back on - 
BRENNAMAN V/O - the A's are down to their last strike and this Yankee crowd is on its feet - Rivera squints for the sign, he has it, delivers and - Again, at the crucial moment, he cuts the radio. Waits just a few moments. Turns the radio back on - 
BRENNAMAN V/O It is bedlam in New York. The Yankees - down two games to none - have come back to win three, and the Division Series. 
The outcome of the series seems to have no effect on Billy. He simply gets up, switches off the radio, and climbs the steps to leave. But somehow we still faintly hear, as he comes past shuttered concession stands toward an exit, the voice of one of the announcers - 
STEVE LYONS V/O This is an exceptional feat not only for New York, Thom, but for Oakland - though not the kind you can be proud of: Only once before has a team lost a Division Series after winning the first two games - 
3 INT. OAKLAND COLISEUM - NIGHT 3 
It's coming from a small television a night security guard is watching. But when he sees Billy approaching, he quickly shuts it off. 
BILLY It's okay, Joe, you can leave it on. It's no big deal. 
SECURITY GUARD No, it's okay, I don't need to watch it. 
The guard's eyes consider the baseball Billy absently turns in his hands - 
BILLY How's Meg? 
SECURITY GUARD She's good, thanks. 
- and the glass window of the bar behind him - 
BILLY And the boys? 
SECURITY GUARD They're good. Everybody's good. 
BILLY That's good. The security guard waits for the baseball to sail through the glass, but it doesn't happen. 
BILLY Night. 
SECURITY GUARD Night, Billy. It was a great season. 
4 EXT. COLISEUM - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT 4 
A lone car sits in the parking lot in front of the Coliseum. We HEAR- 
TARA V/O They had three times your payroll, Billy. 
BILLY Yeah... 
TARA V/O You're not watching them celebrate, right? Car's off. Billy sits in the dark on his phone. 
BILLY No. That would be, uh-- 
TARA V/O Pointless? Self-destructive? Masochistic? 
BILLY Are you asking me to pick one? 
TARA V/O What you should be doing is thinking about what an amazing job you did and how great you are. 
BILLY I'll be honest, right this minute I'm not thinking about either of those things. 
TARA V/O You take a team with that payroll to the playoffs? You take the Yankees to a fifth game? I'm not even sure the better team won. 
BILLY They were down two-love and then beat us three in a row. Trust me, the better team won. 
BILLY presses a button on his portable radio and is hit with sound of sports talk radio-- 
CALLER V/O --while embarrassing the entire city and making a mockery of their fans. I'm sick of this. 
TARA V/O Let's go away. 
BILLY That sounds good. 
CUT TO WHAT BILLY'S BEEN LOOKING AT THIS WHOLE TIME - Three enormous looming likenesses of the Oakland A's premiere players on floodlit banners--Jason Giambi, Johnny Damon, Jason Isringhausen. 
TARA V/O Someplace they don't have a baseball team. 
BILLY How about Oakland? 
TARA V/O Okay, here are the rules for tonight. You can do anything you want but you can't give any quotes to the press, go on the internet or hurt my car, we have a deal? 
BILLY Yeah. 
TARA V/O They had three times your payroll, Billy. From the radio we've been hearing shards of "--an unprecedented choke--", "--get rid of Billy Beane--", "-- Billy Beane knows nothing about baseball--". 
BILLY Yeah. 
TARA V/O How about Hawaii? I'll make a reservation someplace. The place with the turtles. 
Billy gets out of the car. 
BILLY Great. I'm on my way. 
Billy chucks the radio away. Gets back in the car, puts it in gear. HARD CUT TO -- 
5 INT. OAKLAND AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY 5 
Blur of shapes and colors as we move through a crush of travelers to a Hawaiian Airlines counter where Billy and Tara check luggage. Billy's got a cell phone to his ear. 
BILLY Is it Boston? You're talking to Boston? What are they offering? 
BORAS (ON PHONE) What does it matter to you? 
BILLY What?! 
TARA I'm Tara. 
BILLY I know. I need a day. 
TARA 
BILLY -- 
BILLY One day. I'll fly out tomorrow. 
TARA It's gonna be more than one day. 
(PAUSE) We're losing Isringhausen too? 
BILLY Only if my luck stays exactly the same. 
TARA It's like the bell rang but you're still getting hit in the head. (hands him tickets) Just in case. 
BILLY I'm sorry. Have fun out there. 
TARA I'm picking up a guy at the breakfast buffet. 
BILLY A left-handed reliever if you can. 
6 OMITTED 6 
7 INT. SINAI TEMPLE - BRENTWOOD - LATER - DAY 7 
The ceremony is in progress as Billy arrives, plucks a yarmulke from a basket, sets it on his head and finds a place in the back row for himself and his carry-on. He listens to the boy's monotone-reading of verses. He fidgets. Taps his foot. Checks his watch. Turns to the person down the row and whispers -- 
BILLY How much longer you think? 
GUEST What? 
BILLY Nah, it's okay. 
8 INT. TEMPLE LOBBY - LATER - DAY 8 
As attendees exit the ceremony and enter the adjacent banquet hall, Billy has cornered Arn Tellem, picking up right where he left off three hours ago in Oakland on the 
PHONE -- 
BILLY Arn, I don't wanna lose him. 
ARN 
BILLY -- 
BILLY I don't wanna lose him. 
ARN This is my nephew's Bar Mitzvah. 
BILLY He did well with his Torah portion I thought. 
ARN Thank you. 
BILLY What did they offer? 
ARN He's not staying in Oakland, Billy. 
BILLY What did the Yankees offer him? 
ARN It's New York; you've got to give a player a reason not to play there. 
BILLY What did they offer? 
ARN 17 million. 
BILLY No way. 
ARN Yeah. 
BILLY I don't pay my whole infield 17 million dollars. 
ARN I know, I know... 
BILLY For how long? 
ARN 17 a year for seven years. 
Billy stares, completely nonplussed... 
BILLY A hundred and twenty million dollars? 
ARN Hundred and nineteen. 
(BEAT) You gotta get Steve to let you spend some money. 
BILLY That's pretty good advice, I should do that. 
ARN Steve doesn't get it. This isn't a charity raffle. 
BILLY Arn. I get it, he gets it, Jason gets it and you certainly get it. I'll talk to him. 
ARN And you're losing Isringhausen, too. 
BILLY Ya think? 
ARN I've gotta get back. 
BILLY Hey mazel tov, Arn. 
ARN Thank you. Good luck. 
Arn walks away. Billy looks to his right to see a 12 year old kid standing right next to him. 
KID Are you Billy Beane? 
BILLY Yes. 
KID That was a pretty serious choke. 
BILLY Are you from around here? 
KID Yeah. 
BILLY You a Dodger fan? 
KID Yeah. 
Billy hands the kid his scotch -- 
BILLY Here, drink a lot of this. 
-- and walks away. 
9 INT. OFFICE - SAN BRUNO - LATER - DAY 9 
Billy tries, but is having trouble sitting still as he talks with Steve Schott - the A's owner - around 60 - a college player way back when. He's a successful home builder now. Models of developments lie around. 
BILLY We're losing Damon and Giambi. We can't survive losing Damon and Giambi. 
BORAS (V.O.) We have a deal. If it's eight million. 
BILLY Why am I the ugliest girl at the dance, Scott? Why do I get the feeling I'm always gonna be a quarter million short? 
BORAS (V.O.) I'm just doing my job for my client. That's all I'm doing. 
BILLY No, you played me. And you're playing me now. Congratulations, asshole. You win. Billy hangs up on him. 
CUT TO: 
12-14 OMITTED 12-14 
15 INT. OAKLAND COLISEUM - SCOUTING ROOM - PRESENT DAY 15 
Billy and his scouting department - ten men older than him - all former players and tobacco chewers still, each with his own can of Copenhagen and wastebasket - sitting around a large underground cinder block "war room" whose most extravagant appointment is a Mr. Coffee. 
Two large white-boards dominate a wall, covered with magnetic strips with players' names on them. 
On the left board - every player in the A's organization. On the other, even larger board - every player that may be of interest to them from the other organizations. 
It's the most complex chess board you will ever see. But what can be easily discerned are the obvious holes in the A's team - the star players they are about to lose - their names set apart from the positions they're vacating: Jason Giambi (1B), Johnny Damon (CF), Jason Isringhausen (RP). 
GRADY Alright, guys... we had a great year. We won 102 games and we only came a buck short in New York. Now the bad news... we've got three big holes to fill. 
(THEN) Let's start with who we like for Giambi. We'll go around the room. Who you like, Matty? 
KEOUGH I like Geronimo. (approval from the 
OTHER SCOUTS) Guy's an athlete. This guy is big, fast and talented. 
GEORGE Six foot four. 
PITTARO Top of my list. 
POTE Clean cut, good face. 
ARTIE Good jaw. He's the real deal. 
GEORGE Five tools, good lookin'. 
BILLY Can he hit? 
KEOUGH He's a tools guy. 
BILLY Can he hit? 
KEOUGH He's got a great swing. Natural swing. 
BILLY So you're saying he can't hit. 
KEOUGH He can hit. 
BARRY The ball explodes off his bat. 
ARTIE It's exciting. When he hits it sounds like he's droppin' a firecracker at his feet. 
PITTARO Down in the pisser you can hear that sound. 
BARRY Sounds like Mays, Mantle, Aaron... 
BILLY That's not what I asked. I asked can he hit. 
KEOUGH He's a good hitter. 
BILLY If he's a good hitter, why doesn't he hit good? 
KEOUGH He needs a little work. He'll be able to hit. He could be a great hitter. 
BILLY Right... we put him up against big league competition and suddenly he'll be able to hit. 
Grady moves on -- 
GRADY Artie, who do we like? 
Billy backs off, incredulous as the scouts prattle on -- 
ARTIE I like Perez. He swings like a man. 
KEOUGH He swings like a man who swings at too much. 
ARTIE There's some work needs to be done. I admit it. He needs to be reworked a little. But he's noticeable. 
GRADY He's notable? 
ARTIE No, he's noticeable. You notice him. 
KEOGH He's got an ugly girlfriend. 
BARRY What's that mean? 
KEOGH Ugly girlfriend means no confidence. 
BARRY Alright. That's true. 
PITTARO I agree with Art. I like the way he walks into a room. Kid's so confident his dick gets there two minutes before he does. 
GEORGE Passes the eye candy test. He's got the looks, he's ready to play the part. He just needs some playing time. 
KEOUGH I'm just saying, his girlfriend's a 6. 
BARRY Billy, if you want to talk about another Giambi, this guy could be it. Enough. Billy raises a book above the table, drops it with a dull THUD... STOPPING TRAFFIC. 
GRADY Is that a suggestion, Billy? 
BILLY Guys, stop. You're talking like this is business as usual. It's not. 
GRADY We're trying to solve the problem. 
BILLY Not like this. You're not even looking at the problem. 
GRADY We not only have a very clear understanding of the problem we now face, but everyone in this room has faced similar problems countless times before. 
BILLY Good. What's the problem? 
GRADY The problem is that we've lost 3 key players that we now have to replace. 
BILLY Uh-uh. What's the problem? 
PITTARO The problem is the same as it always is; we've got to put a team together with what we've got. 
BILLY Uh-uh. What's the problem? 
BARRY We've got 38 home runs to replace, 120 rbi's, 47 doubles... 
BILLY Okay, stop. The problem we're trying to solve is that this is an unfair game. There are rich teams, poor teams, 50 feet of crap and then there's us. And now we've been gutted. We're organ donors to the rich. The Red Sox took our kidneys and the Yankees took our heart. And now I'm listening to the same old shit about having a good body and being a tools guy like you're looking for Fabio. Is there another first baseman like Giambi? 
(BEAT) Is there? Everyone mumbles "no." 
BILLY Then stop looking for one because what we'll surely wind up with is the McNuggets version of Giambi. 
GRADY Look, we're gonna find 25 guys, put `em through player development, teach `em how to play Oakland A baseball. This is no time to push the panic button. This is the way we've been doing it for 150 years. Let us do our job. 
The elevator door closes. 
21 INT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT 21 
Billy's in coach, staring at the night through the window, lost in thought. 
22 INT. HOUSE - SAN DIEGO - DAY - 1980 22 
Billy's mother and father escort Martinez and Mets Head Scout Roger Jongewaard into the kitchen. 
MOTHER Billy? They're here. 
JONGEWAARD Billy... Good to see you again. Obviously you're a very special player. We'd like to compliment you on your high school career, and we're looking forward to you being a part of the Mets family. Jongewaard sits at the kitchen table, speaking more to Billy's parents than Billy himself -- 
JONGEWAARD There's good -- and there's premium. Your son is premium. He has it all -- power, speed, the arm. The Look -- and I'm never wrong about that. Which is why this is a premium number. He sets a contract on the table. Clipped to its top- sheet is a check. On its left-hand corner is the Mets insignia; on the right, the amount: $125,000. They all see it. A lot of money in 1980. Silence. Then -- 
MOTHER Billy's been offered a scholarship to Stanford. 
JONGEWAARD I know. And that's a great accomplishment. I'm sure you're very proud of him. 
MOTHER So he can accept that, go there, and then - 
Jongewaard is already shaking his head no. 
JONGEWAARD I understand how important college is. I do. But what I can't do is burn a second first-round draft pick on someone who can't play for four years -- no matter how good he is. Four years is ample time for someone to get hurt. It happens all the time. So, no. I'm sorry. It has to be one or the other. To postpone four years is four years he could be in big leagues. The sooner he gets there the sooner he can reap the benefits. 
Stanford or The Money. Young Billy regards the check, and then his parents. He really doesn't know what to do. 
JONGEWAARD We're going to give him a different kind of education. This won't be his life's career, it'll be his first career. He's going to be a young guy in the business world when his baseball career is done. He'll still have his whole life ahead of him. 
FATHER It's your decision, Billy. Whatever you decide is fine with us. 
23 INT. BILLY'S HOUSE - NIGHT 23 
BILLY's looking out his window while holding his cordless phone. He's dialed the numbers in and just has to hit the green button. 
And now he does. 
INTERCUT WITH 
24 INT. PETER'S APARTMENT - SAME TIME 24 
PETER's ringing cell phone wakes him up and he answers it. 
PETER Hello? 
BILLY It's Billy Beane. 
PETER What time is it? 
BILLY I don't care. Would you have drafted me in the first round? 
PETER What? 
BILLY After I left you ran me through your computer, right? Would you have drafted me in the first round? 
PETER You were a good baseball player. 
BILLY Would you have drafted me in the first round? 
PETER 
(PAUSE) I'd have drafted you in the ninth round. No signing bonus. You'd have passed and gone to Stanford. 
BILLY Pack your suitcases. 
PETER Why? 
BILLY I just bought you from the Cleveland Indians. 
BILLY hangs up the phone. He sits all alone for a moment. 
25 EXT. OAKLAND COLISEUM - MORNING 25 
MONTAGE: Peter pulls into the parking lot for his first day of work, takes in the sight of the colossal, concrete relic that is the Oakland Coliseum. He's just in time to see a paint roller on a long pole laying a white stripe down the middle of Jason Giambi's giant portrait. 
CUT TO: 
26 INT. PETER'S OFFICE - NIGHT 26 
PETER's completely converted the place. The dry erase boards are covered with undecipherable equations, algorithms and numbers and PETER, who's pretty tired now after not a lot of sleep, is in the middle of this. This is what BILLY sees when he walks into the doorway, where he slows down, stops and looks around blankly. 
BILLY Good evening. 
PETER Good evening. 
BILLY I asked you to do three. 
PETER Yes. 
BILLY To evaluate three available players. 
PETER Yeah. 
BILLY And how many did you do? 
PETER 
BILLY 
OKAY-- 
PETER 51, I don't know why I lied just then. 
BILLY Talk me through the wall. PETER gets up and gives BILLY a tour of the dry erase boards. 
PETER This is the American League West. This year we're going to need to win between 97 and 101 games to make the post season. Here's the number of runs we'll need to score in order to win those games and here's the number of runs we can allow. 
BILLY Let's make sure we're on the same page. 
PETER Okay. 
BILLY We're going to re-think baseball. 
PETER Yes. 
BILLY Look for an inefficiencies in statistics. 
PETER Examine the ways that runs are scored and prevented. 
BILLY Exploit the fact that unspectacular runs are just as valuable as 450-foot bombs. 
PETER Unspectacular runs are more valuable. 
BILLY Why? 
PETER/BILLY 
(SIMULTANEOUSLY) Because they cost less. 
BILLY We believe there's a river that hasn't been fished. 
BILLY It was cold. 
The news bothers no one. 
GRADY Let's get after our relief pitching problem. 
BILLY We got Chad Bradford. Right-hander. 
Few, if any of them, have heard of Bradford and begin leafing through their printouts and notes. 
GRADY Submariner? 
BILLY That's the one. Technically an underhander. 
GRADY What's his velocity? 
BILLY Unimpressive. 
ARTIE About 85. 
GRADY Does he have a good breaking ball? 
BILLY Doesn't have one. 
GRADY Why do you like this guy? 
BILLY Well, he gets people out. 
ARTIE The left-hander hitters get a really good look at him. 
GRADY He's down there. He's down there real low, too. 
BILLY Let's move on. 
The scouts aren't sure what to say, and so say nothing. 
EVENTUALLY - 
GRADY Well, we, I think, have fared better. We have some ideas for what to do about Giambi. 
BILLY Knock me down. 
GRADY We trade power for speed. A rabbit for a gorilla - We go for an overachiever. A big heart in the last year his contract. Tend to play hard. We usually get a pretty good year out of them. Make up for some of the offense we lost. (puts more names up) Or the other option. Just a thought. We go for a high-maintenance guy. A guy that's a little difficult but talented. A guy like Milton Bradley. Well, not like Milton. Milton himself. Which do you want to talk about first? 
BILLY None of them. Grady looks like a man who can't take much more. 
BILLY You're still looking to replace him; you're just saying it another way. 
BARRY We got some trades here. 
BILLY We can't do it. What we can do is recreate his value to us in the aggregate. 
GRADY The (what) - 
BILLY Giambi's on-base percentage was .477. Damon's was .324. And Olmeda's - bless his heart - was .291. Add that up and you get - He points to Peter. 
PETER You want me to speak? 
BILLY When I point at you, yes. 
PETER Ten-ninety-two. 
BILLY Divided by three - 
PETER Three-sixty-four. 
BILLY That's what we're looking for. And that's what we'll find. Three players whose average OBP is - 
PETER Three-sixty-four. 
ARTIE That doesn't come out right. 
BILLY You gotta carry the one. 
ARTIE Still don't look right. 
BILLY It's right. The others aren't sure what confuses them more - the logic, or the guy who shouldn't be in this room. 
GRADY Billy? 
BILLY Yes. 
GRADY Who's that? 
BILLY That's Peter. And that's all he's going to tell them about Peter. 
GRADY I don't know how to say this delicately - but does - Peter - need to be here? 
BILLY Yes. 
POLONI What's with this on base percentage obsession? Is that Bill James bullshit? 
BILLY You can call it Billy Beane bullshit for all I care. 
Billy takes a Marks-A-Lot, jots down three names on strips, and approaches the board. 
BILLY So here's who we want. One. 
He puts the first strip up. It reads: JEREMY GIAMBI. 
BILLY Jason's little brother Jeremy. 
BARRY He never comes home from the games. 
POLONI Billy, if I may, he's had his problems on the field -- not to mention his problems off the field -- not to mention he's getting a little thick around the middle -- there's the stuff with the weed. He's at strip joints... 
GRADY This guy could start the year with an agent and end up with a parole officer for Christ's sake. 
BILLY His on-base percentage is all we're looking at now and he gets on base an awful lot for someone who only costs $285,000 a year. 
GEORGE He can't catch a ball in the outfield. I've seen him lose a ball in the moonlight. Billy puts up another name: DAVID JUSTICE. 
BILLY David Justice. 
GRADY Ten years ago he was a big name. He's going to really help our season tickets at the beginning of the year. But by June he's not going to be hitting his weight. 
PITTARO He's 36! 
ARTIE His legs are gone. He's a defensive liability. I question whether the bat speed is still there. 
BARRY Steinbrenner is so pissed at his decline he's willing to eat up half his contract to get rid of him. 
BILLY That's good. 
HOPKINS He's a fossil. With all due respect, bringing these three guys aboard is like putting bubble gum on a flat tire. 
GRADY And why do we want to be the ones to bail Justice out of his contract? 
Billy points at PETER -- 
PETER He gets on base. 
(FUCK IT) I can't throw at all. 
BILLY Yeah, don't worry about it. You've thrown your last baseball from behind the plate. I want you at first. SCOTT is so thrown by this that all he can do is stare at BILLY. Then at WASHINGTON, who's shrug tells SCOTT "This wasn't my idea." 
SCOTT I've only ever played catcher. 
BILLY You're not a catcher anymore. If you were, then mine wouldn't have been the only call you got when your contract expired at midnight. 
SCOTT I appreciate it but-- 
BILLY You're welcome. 
SCOTT 
YOU SEE-- 
BILLY You don't know how to play first base. 
SCOTT That's right. 
BILLY It's not that hard. Tell him, Wash. 
WASHINGTON It's incredibly hard! 
BILLY Anything worth doing is. Wash is gonna teach you. 
SCOTT Wait a minute, what about-- 
BILLY Jason's gone, Scott. 
SCOTT I'm taking Giambi's spot at first? What about the fans? 
WASHINGTON Yeah, maybe I can teach one of them. 
BILLY The fans don't run-- 
(TO WASHINGTON) 
--GOOD ONE-- (back to SCOTT) --the fans don't run my ball club. 
SCOTT They're gonna hate me. 
WASHINGTON (motioning to BILLY) No, they're gonna hate him. 
BILLY The fans love me. 
WASHINGTON Okay. 
HATTEBERG's YOUNG DAUGHTER comes down the staircase in her pajamas, having just woken up in the middle of the night. 
BILLY Hello. 
HATTEBERG'S DAUGHTER Hi. 
SCOTT That's our youngest daughter. 
BILLY Great. 
SCOTT Do you have kids? 
BILLY doesn't like to share personal lives with the players but he covers well-- 
BILLY --yeah, I have a daughter. 
BILLY takes a contract out of his windbreaker and sets it on the table next to the cookies. 
BILLY This is a contract for you to play baseball with the Oakland A's. A copy's on its way to your agent. Discuss it with your wife and let us know. (They get up and Billy calls off) Thanks for the cookies, ma'am. We see ELIZABETH with tears running down her face...then go back to the living room-- 
ELIZABETH (O.S.) You're welcome. 
BILLY (on his way out) Merry Christmas. 
35 EXT./INT. SAN DIEGO - PRESENT DAY 35 
The door of a suburban house opens, revealing a WOMAN. 
BILLY Hi. 
SHARON Hi, Billy. 
She pulls the door open so he can come in. As he does - 
BILLY She home? 
SHARON She's out, but she'll be home soon. 
36 INT. SAN DIEGO HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 36 
As Billy enters his ex-wife Sharon's house, her husband ALAN walks in, talking on the phone. 
ALAN 
(ON PHONE) Yeah, no, don't worry about it sweetie. Here's mom. 
Alan hands Sharon the phone. 
BILLY Hey Alan. 
ALAN Come on in have a seat. Want some coconut water? It's really refreshing. 
BILLY I'm all set, thanks. 
ALAN What are you benching now? 
BILLY I don't keep count. 
ALAN Well, whatever it is, it's working. You look good. 
They sit on the couch next to a Christmas tree. 
ALAN I haven't got to see you since the playoffs in New York. That was heartbreaking, Billy. We were rooting for you. 
BILLY 
(BEAT) Yep. 
ALAN You know what I say? 
BILLY Fuck `em. 
(BEAT) I'm sorry Alan, what do you say? 
ALAN No, I just wanted to say that a lot of teams don't get that far, and to make it that far is a really big accomplishment. 
Sharon gets off the phone and joins them. 
BILLY 
(TO SHARON) So how is she? 
SHARON She's great. Be here in a minute. How's the team shaping up? 
LEGEND: 1986 
BILLY playing for minor League Toledo. He swings and pops up lamely to the PITCHER, throwing his bat down in frustration as he jogs hopelessly to first and we 
ANNOUNCER V/O ...Billy Beane, who's quickly establishing a new record for breaking bats, bat racks and water coolers, was actually a much-touted first round pick of the New York Mets in 1980 but the majors have not been kind to him with only 18 plate appearances in two years and this won't doing anything to help him as...

46 EXT. OAKLAND COLISEUM FIELD - NIGHT 46 
LEGEND: 1989 
ANNOUNCER V/O ...If you're a real baseball fan with a good memory you might remember that Billy Beane was taken in the first round of the amateur draft back in 1980, separated from All-Star outfielder Daryl Strawberry by only 14 picks, so it just goes to show... 
BILLY in an A's uniform. He stands and watches a called third strike sail past him. 
UMPIRE Strike! 
Billy breaks the bat over his thigh and drops the pieces on the plate. He begins to walk off. 
UMPIRE Hey Billy, clean up after yourself. 
Billy hears him but continues to walk off. 
TO BE WRITTEN: THE UMP TOSSES BILLY FROM THE GAME. 
BILLY looks up at SHARON in the seats behind the dugout but the two can't quite meet each other's eyes. 
47 INT. OAKLAND COLISEUM - DAY 47 
In the subterranean video room - an even less elegant place than the rest of the stadium - someone has put up a scraggly Christmas tree. There, Peter watches a tape of a minor leaguer on the Lowell Spinners, a Single-A Boston affiliate. Billy comes in. 
PETER How'd it go? 
BILLY How'd what go? 
PETER Hatteberg. 
BILLY He can barely hold a baseball. But he's our guy now. Billy sits. 
BILLY Who's that? 
PETER That is Kevin Youkilis. This is the guy we want more than anyone else in the world. 
Billy watches the guy on the screen. He's an overweight right-handed batter with a peculiar stance. 
PETER He can't run, throw or field. But he walks more than anyone in baseball except Barry Bonds. Take out intentional walks and it's more than Bonds. He's the Greek God of Walks. 
On the TV, the batter takes another pitch just off the edge of the strike zone. 
PETER I tried to get Shapiro to draft him last June. He said he waddled like a duck. Boston took him. Boston won't let him go yet. They're going to wait and see. 
They watch him lay off a pitch an inch outside the strike zone. Peter gives Billy a look that says, You see that? 
PETER You all right, Billy? 
GRADY O/S Billy? Grady has appeared behind them at the door. 
GRADY Can we talk a minute? 
BILLY Yeah. 
(TO PETER) Yeah. 
48 INT. LOCKER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 48 
Grady closes the video room door for privacy. The only other person in sight is manager Art Howe, in his office in street clothes. He shuts his windowed door so Grady and Billy can talk in confidence. 
GRADY Your boy and I had a talk while you were in Tacoma. I didn't like much of what I heard. 
BILLY No? 
GRADY No. You got a kid in there with a Yale economics degree and a scout out here with 29 years baseball experience and you're listening to the wrong one. 
BILLY I don't listen to anyone, you know that. 
GRADY This isn't a joke. 
BILLY I'm not joking. 
GRADY This isn't how you run a ball club, with a computer. You know that. You're a baseball man. There are intangibles that only a scout can see in a player that you're not going to pick up with just numbers, with someone who doesn't play the game, who knows nothing about the game but how to feed numbers into a computer. 
BILLY That's what we're doing. That's exactly what we're doing. 
GRADY If this is what baseball is, if it's not Kirk Gibson going up to the plate on two bad legs because the manager felt in his heart that he had one swing left in that body... a computer wouldn't do that. They would have had him sitting up in the stands. 
BILLY A computer doesn't romanticize the sport. Leave that for the fans. 
GRADY Well, romance and the fans, it's called a love affair with the game and it's been going on for one hundred and fifty years. 
BILLY I don't want to hurt you love affair with the game. Just because we've been doing it one way for a hundred and fifty years doesn't mean we've been doing it right. You have any idea how long people thought the sun revolved around the earth? To your eyes it looks like that's what's happening. 
GRADY You're saying everybody's been wrong? Everybody? Beat. 
GRADY Are you saying everybody's been wrong? 
BILLY Yes. Maybe.

BILLY (CONT'D) Yes, and I've thought so my whole life. And now we're gonna see if I'm--

LEGEND: April 1, 2002 - OPENING DAY IN THE LOCKER ROOM: Players prepare. Magnante puts on his knee braces. 
MAGNANTE Yeah... been doing it for way too long. 
HATTEBERG How long does it take? 
MAGNANTE When I first started these things? It was like a half hour process. Now I can knock these suckers out in 30 seconds, no problem. 
52 INT. A'S LOCKER ROOM - SAME TIME - DAY 52 
Jeremy Giambi's boombox is on again as he and his 24 teammates suit up. 36-year-old David Justice wanders past to a soda machine. Presses a button, but nothing comes out. Tries again. 
TEJADA Is a dollar, mang. 
JUSTICE What? 
TEJADA Always been like that here. 
JUSTICE You're kidding me, right? 
TEJADA Welcome to Oakland. 
BILLY and PETER walk through. He walks past CHAD BRADFORD's locker... 
CHAD Excuse me, Mr. Beane. 
BILLY Hey Chad. 
CHAD I hope I'm not disturbing you. 
BILLY You're not, what's up? 
CHAD I wanted to say thanks for the opportunity. 
BILLY It's gonna work out well for both of us. 
CHAD Nobody in the major league ever took me seriously. 
BILLY 
(PAUSE) Nobody? 
CHAD Just you, sir. 
BILLY Okay.

MONTAGE: 
It's fifteen minutes before the game as some executives have their picture taken on the field with BILLY. 
BILLY Hey, great to see you. Thanks for coming out. Got a good box? You want a picture? Sure, let me step in there. Great, big smiles now. Big smiles. Know what I like about opening day? Everyone's even. Thank you. You all enjoy the game. 
BILLY gets his picture taken with KIDS from an area Little League team. He's laughing and being a good host. 
BILLY Hey, how you guys doing. So you won? That's great. What position are you? How's your fastball? 92? Alright, should we get a pic? 
Billy and the Little League team pose with a giant donation check. The announcer then directs everyone's attention to a trophy ceremony in progress. As Chavez receives his Golden Glove award and smiles for the fans...

BILLY greeting some VIP's in their field-level seats. Throughout this we'll hear bits of talk radio. 
HOST #1 (FROM RADIO) With the departure of head scout Grady Fuson and a roster that I'll describe as unusual, if not eccentric, you have to wonder what Billy Beane is thinking. BILLY catches a glance of ELIZABETH HATTEBERG taking her seat nearby. 
In the family area, Elizabeth introduces herself to Tara. 
ELIZABETH Hi, I'm Elizabeth. 
TARA Hi. Tara. Which is yours? 
ELIZABETH Scott Hatteberg. Catcher - actually first base - actually we don't know. Yours? 
TARA 
GM.

BILLY Okay, good.

PETER No. 
BILLY I'm a player, cut me from the roster. 
PETER No. 
BILLY Do it. 
PETER This is stupid. 
BILLY Man-up, Yale. 
PETER Fine. Billy, would you have a seat for a moment, I need to talk to you. 
BILLY I'm already sitting. 
PETER I was pretending you weren't sitting. 
BILLY But I am. Keep going. 
PETER This is the hardest thing there is to do in baseball. 
BILLY You got that from Bull Durham? 
PETER Yeah. 
BILLY Hitting a curve ball is the hardest thing there is to do in baseball but go ahead. 
PETER You've been a huge part of this team but decisions have to be made that are best for the team, I'm sure you can understand that. 
BILLY You're cutting me? 
PETER I'm really sorry. 
BILLY I just bought a house here. 
PETER 
(BEAT) Well... 
BILLY Well? That's all you have to say? My kids just started at a new school, they made friends. 
PETER That's--I'd leave them in school, you don't want to take them out in the middle 
OF THE-- 
BILLY What the hell are you doing? 
PETER Are you you or the player? 
BILLY I'm me. You're talking about kids and schools and you should've been out of the room three minutes ago. 
PETER Shouldn't I tell them that they'll always be a part of the A's family? 
BILLY That makes me feel so good I'm thinking of burning your house down with you in it. These are professional baseball players. You just do it. "Peter, I need to let you go. Jack's office'll handle the paperwork." 
PETER That's it? 
BILLY Would you rather get one bullet in the head or five in the chest and bleed to death? 
PETER Those are my only choices? 
BILLY Go on the road with the team.

DAVID How come your boss doesn't travel with the team? 
PETER He doesn't like to mingle with the players. 
DAVID Makes us easier to cut? 
PETER doesn't say anything... 
DAVID He's gonna make some moves if we keep losing. PETER gives a small "Yeah" shrug... 
DAVID How come soda costs a dollar in the clubhouse? 
PETER Billy likes to keep the money on the field. 
DAVID Soda money? 
PETER doesn't say anything... 
DAVID Where on the field is the dollar I pay for soda?

PASSENGER Hey, aren't you Billy Beane? 
BILLY Yeah. 
PASSENGER Shouldn't you be at the game? 
BILLY Nope. 
CASEY emerges from the gate, sees her father before he sees her and runs to him. They hug. 
CASEY Hey, Dad. 
BILLY Hey, honey... I'm glad to see you. 
CUT TO: 
CASEY Sorry. 
BILLY Do I look like I'm worried? 
CASEY Yeah. 
BILLY `Cause you're getting on an airplane and those things crash all the time. Will you please stop worrying about your father? You're a kid, I can't have it. 
CASEY Okay. Can I worry about the airplane now though? 
BILLY Absolutely. 
A FLIGHT ATTENDANT approaches -- 
FLIGHT ATTENDANT We're all set. 
BILLY Great. 
There's a slightly awkward moment and CASEY isn't sure whether she's supposed to hug her father again and so they do a sort of half-hug. 
BILLY I love you. BILLY watches her go off with the attendant, feeling like it was an unsatisfying visit. 
He looks at his blackberry-- 3-2. Magnante in.

SCHOTT Billy. 
BILLY You remember Peter. 
SCHOTT Peter. Guys, give me some idea of what's going on out there. 
BILLY Listen, it's a team of probabilities, and we're gonna need 162 games to tell that tale in a nascent form. It's phase one, we're evolving and we feel confident where we're heading. 
SCHOTT 
BILLY - 
BILLY We're not scared. 
SCHOTT 3 out of 17 games. 3. We're getting crucified in the press. What makes you think this is gonna turn around? 
BILLY Because I believe in what we're doing. I believe the numbers. I believe the record doesn't accurately reflect the team and where we're going to be at the end of the season. Peter and I feel very strongly that we need to stick to the game plan, and you can tell your partners to start booking their tickets to the playoffs. 
SCHOTT Billy, look, you've got guys who are nearly crippled, who couldn't get hired as an usher in a ballpark now playing on the team. Give me something I can go back to these guys with and feel like I have the confidence that you're gonna turn these things around. 
PETER What about Jeremy? Am I telling him, too. 
BILLY No. I'll do that. 
B99 INT. LOCKER ROOM B99 
Peter walks into the locker room. Sees Pena talking to a couple of other players. He approaches Pena. 
PETER Hey, Carlos. 
PENA Yeah. 
PETER Can I get a moment with you? 
PENA Sure. 
PETER Okay, maybe we can talk over here. 
They walk awkwardly to the players' lounge. 
PETER Have a seat. They sit. 
PETER So, um, Carlos, you've been traded to the Tigers. This is the number of Jay Palmer, their travel secretary. He's expecting your call. He'll help you arrange travel to Detroit. 
Pena sits and stares at him. It's excruciating for Peter, awkward, until -- 
PENA Is that all? 
PETER Yeah. 
PENA Cool. 
Pena just takes it. Picks up the number and leaves. 
99 INT. ART'S OFFICE - LATER - DAY 99 
Billy knocks and lets himself in. 
BILLY Mind if I have a seat. 
ART Please. 
BILLY You can't start Pena at first tonight, you'll have to start Hatteberg. 
ART I don't want to go 15 rounds, Billy, the line-up card is mine and that's all. 
BILLY The line-up card is definitely yours, I'm just saying you can't start Pena at first. 
ART I am starting Pena at first. 
BILLY I don't think so, he plays for the Detroit Tigers now. 
ART 
(PAUSE) You traded Pena?! 
BILLY Along with German, Hiljus and Jeremy Giambi. 
ART You are outside your fucking mind. 
Art stares at him in a silence broken by Jeremy Giambi knocking on the open door. 
BILLY Jeremy, come on in. 
Billy jots a phone number on an A's Post-It and hands it to him. 
BILLY This is Ed Wade's number. You know him? 
Art looks sick. 
JEREMY No. 
BILLY Phillies General Manager. Real nice guy. Give him a call - he's expecting it - say hello - then talk to Futterman about arranging a flight for you. 
JEREMY The what? 
BILLY The flight. To Philadelphia. Billy gets up and shakes his hand. 
BILLY It's been a real pleasure, Jeremy. I mean that. You're a great ballplayer and great guy. 
Jeremy, not sure he heard right, looks at the Post-It in his hand as Billy escorts him to the door. 
BILLY We're going to miss you. 
Jeremy leaves. Billy looks at Art from the door. 
BILLY Adkins is gone, too. 
ART You're killing this team. 
BILLY Art? I can do this all day long.

BILLY and PETER stride through as the team is getting dressed for batting practice. The place quiets down as BILLY comes in. They've all heard the news and they've never experienced a move like this in their careers. 
BILLY I'm screwin' with you, Haddie. 
HATTEBERG So we just don't steal? 
BILLY That's right. 
LONG That's what I do. That's what you pay me to do. 
BILLY No, I pay you to get on first, not get thrown out at second. 
LONG I don't get thrown out much. 
BILLY I don't hit on 17 at the blackjack table, but if I did, the odds would be the same. 
PETER You've actually gotten caught 6 out of 17 tries this season. 
LONG I get 11 of 17. That's not bad. 
BILLY You just handed them an out. Protect your outs like they're your children. There's no clock on this game. Until the third out, anything can happen. Get on base and let the next guy move you up. Pass the torch, pass the torch. We're like a machine. A run making machine.

BILLY Hey, Dave. I've been thinking... I want you to -- 
JUSTICE You gonna teach me something? 
BILLY Excuse me? 
JUSTICE I've never seen a GM talk to players. 
BILLY You've never seen a GM who was a player. 
JUSTICE Huh. 
BILLY Is there a problem? 
JUSTICE It's okay, man. I know your routine. It's a patter, it's rap, it's for effect. That's okay. But it's for them, it's not for me. 
BILLY You're special? 
JUSTICE You're paying me 7 million bucks so I guess I am a little. 
BILLY As a matter of fact I'm not paying you 7 million bucks, David. The Yankees are paying half your salary. That's what the New York Yankees think of you. 
(MORE) 
BILLY (CONT'D) They're paying you three and a half million dollars to play against them. 
If this is news to Justice, he doesn't show it. 
JUSTICE Where are you going with this, Billy? 
BILLY You're almost 37, Dave. Almost as old as me. Let's be honest with each other about what we each want. I want to milk the last ounce of baseball you have left in you, and you want to stay in the show. So let's do that. I'm not paying you to be the player you used to be, I'm paying you to be the player you are now. You're smart, you know what's going on here. I need you to set an example for the younger guys. Take a leadership role. 
Justice just studies him ... then nods. 
BILLY We're cool? 
JUSTICE We're cool. 
BILLY All right. Billy starts to leave, but has one last thought for him -- 
BILLY You know -- the Yankees are coming to town. If it were me -- I'd want to take that three point five and shove it up their ass. But I'm a competitor. 
Billy exits. Justice calls after him -- 
JUSTICE You know, I got a couple World Series rings. I think I'm a pretty good competitor, too.

The wheels of the team jet lift off-- 
111 INT. BILLY'S OFFICE - NIGHT 111 
The TV is on as BILLY and PETER work, seeming more and more like mad scientists who are getting closer and closer to splitting the atom. 
GREG PAPA OR RAY FOSSE (TV) What is happening in Oakland?!! The A's have won seven in a row and 15 of their last 19. You got to hand it to Art Howe. He's managing this unorthodox team in an unorthodox way. They are not bunting. They are not stealing. They are just winning. And Art Howe is the reason. 
PETER Did you hear that? 
BILLY I heard 7 in a row. Billy clicks off the TV and it's very quiet. Billy is scrolling down numbers that show trends and comparisons of all of the A's relief pitching. 
The game plays on TV as BILLY bench presses. The A's are up by three runs in the ninth inning but the Indians have a runner on first. 
Through the tunnel, BILLY can hear the crack of the bat and a collective groan from the stands. 
BILLY holds the barbell in the air--frozen--as he simply looks at the T.V. and sees the silent images. 
114 EXT. FIELD - NIGHT (HYBRID) 114 
ART HOWE walking to the mound, tapping his left hand. 
MAGNANTE heading to the mound. 
115 INT. WEIGHT ROOM - NIGHT 115 
We think BILLY's going to trash the weights, but he simply returns the barbell to the bracket, sits up and watches the silent images. 
116 EXT. FIELD - NIGHT (HYBRID) 116 
MAGNANTE mops his brow, squints for the sign, winds up and makes his pitch. It misses low for ball four and PEDRO walks to first. 
117 INT. WEIGHT ROOM - NIGHT 117 
Billy lays back on the bench, breathes, then unmutes the T.V. and we hear - 
ANNOUNCER (FROM TV) Magnante has quickly let two on base for Lee Stevens who's the go ahead run for the Indians in a game that Oakland appeared to have put away. And then - BILLY sits calmly...waits for it...and-- 
CRACK! 
--BILLY nods his head at the inevitable. 
ANNOUNCER (FROM TV) That ball is deep....way back...three run homer for Lee Stevens to put Cleveland ahead in the ninth inning... BILLY can hear 40,000 people booing their lungs out. He takes a moment, then grabs his jacket. 
118 EXT. FIELD - NIGHT 118 
The FANS are booing as ART makes his way to the mound to take MAGNANTE out. BRADFORD makes his way from the bullpen and takes the ball from ART. ART turns to head back to the dugout but slows as he sees a strange sight: BILLY is standing at the dugout rail. 
The plate UMPIRE notices and follows Art's line of sight. He sees BILLY and walks over there ahead of Art. 
UMPIRE You can't be in there, Billy. 
BILLY doesn't move. He just watches ART as he comes into the dugout. 
UMPIRE Billy? 
The PLAYERS are watching to see what's going to happen. BILLY puts his hand on ART's shoulder a second as he says- 
BILLY Just nod a little bit--not too much--like I'm assuring you you didn't just make a calamitous vocational decision. 
UMPIRE Players and coaches only, Billy. 
BILLY (ignoring the umpire-- still quietly to 
ART) Remember that in about four seconds-- BILLY sees one of the nearby TV cameras pivot over to catch this conversation-- 
BILLY --yeah there it is. We're the lead story on Sports Center now so let me be brief. First of all, that was an awfully costly fuck-you, wouldn't you say?

BILLY Second of all, genius, those boos? They're for you. Drink up.

CUT TO: 
119 INT. BILLY'S TRUCK - NIGHT 119 
The radio is on and the ANNOUNCER is telling us-- 
ANNOUNCER (FROM RADIO) ...after giving up the lead on a three run homer off Magnante, the A's came right back to win it in the bottom of the ninth with another three run homer by Miguel Tejada. And the A's have won eight in a row!

Billy, standing at the door, surveys the room, his eyes moving from player to player as they're hanging up their street clothes. The team's equipment manager, pouring himself a cup of coffee, glances over - 
VOOS You want one, Billy? 
BILLY I'm good, Voos. Thanks. 
Voos wanders off. Billy keeps looking at the players ... 
LEGEND: July 31 - TRADE DEADLINE 
E120 INT. SCOUTS ROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY E120 
Billy comes in sticking some tobacco under his lip and, like a shark that knows it could die if it stops moving, doesn't through the entire scene -- 
BILLY Suzanne, get Shapiro on the phone. 
PETER Are you thinking Rincon? 
BILLY Yeah, he's lost faith for the season. I think he's gonna dump him. 
PETER Hardcore. 
They wait as Suzanne dials the Indians' GM, staring at the speakerphone that sits like a little island in the middle of the conference table. 
SUZANNE Shapiro on two. 
BILLY Mark. Billy. Let's be honest. A premiere setup man is not going to get you any closer to the playoffs. 
SHAPIRO V/O Are you referring to Rincon? 
BILLY He's a luxury you can't afford. 
SHAPIRO V/O And you can? There's half a million on his contract and at least one other suitor. 
BILLY By at least one, you mean one? Who is it? 
SHAPIRO V/O I'd rather not say. 
PETER 
(WHISPERS) San Francisco. 
(MUTE) I'm on with Steve. 
(UNMUTE) Not his fault. We misused him. 
PETER Steve Schott. 
BILLY Tell him to hold. (to Steve Phillips) Look. Steve. Here's the deal. I'm being straight with you. I'm getting Rincon. It's a done deal. It's done. 
PHILLIPS V/O I heard the Giants -- 
BILLY No, the Giants want Venafro. And I told them they can have him for Michaelson... 
PETER 
ANDERSON -- 
BILLY -- but I'd rather deal with you. Because you can give me Eckerton and two hundred and twenty-five thousand cash and the Giants can't. Billy's look to Peter says, Doesn't hurt to ask. As they listen to silence on Phillips' side of the call -- 
PETER Yes, I understand it's impolite to keep you holding. 
PHILLIPS V/O I'll think about it. 
BILLY Of course. Think. But whoever calls me back first gets Venafro. He hangs up. Looks for the blinking light that belongs to his owner. 
PETER He hung up. 
Silence. Then -- 
BILLY If you could have the power of flight or invisibility, which would you choose? 
PETER What? 
BILLY Invisibility or flight? 
PETER 
(THINKS) Invisibility. 
BILLY That's what Casey said. Why? 
PETER You'd have total access. Besides, everyone else would choose flight. 
Quiet. 
BILLY Why isn't anybody calling? The phone rings. 
SUZANNE Shapiro's on two. 
Billy picks up. Listens. Fist pump. 
BILLY Great. Lemme talk to my owner. Call you right back. 
(THEN) Get Steve. 
PETER Phillips or Schott? 
BILLY Why would I call Phillips back? Schott. Tell him I'm on the other line. 
PETER Right. 
Peter dials. Billy can't sit. 
PETER Mr. Schott, it's Peter Brand. Sorry I left you on hold. Billy asked me to call you back. He's on another line. 
BILLY Tell him we need two hundred and twenty- five grand for Rincon. 
PETER Billy says he needs two hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars for Ricardo Rincon. Please? 
(THEN) Yes, I added the please. (listens; to Billy) No. Billy thinks intensely. Finally -- 
BILLY Tell him I'll pay it, but when I sell him next year for twice that, I keep the money. 
PETER Billy says he'll pay for Rincon himself, sell him next year, and keep the profit. 
Peter listens to whatever Steve Schott is saying, then -- 
PETER Okay. Thank you. 
(HANGS UP) He says he'll pay for Rincon. High five. 
BILLY Great! Shit. What are we forgetting? 
(CALLING OUT) Get me Shapiro! 
-- as he grabs his cell phone and hits speed dial. 
BILLY Wait, never mind! (beat, then into 
PHONE) Mark. Yeah, it's Billy. Here's the deal. I don't want Rincon pitching against me tonight. Tell him to change his clothes. I got you the money and I accept your gratitude. It's done. He hangs up. Fist bump. 
BILLY We gotta let someone go. It's Mags. It's gotta be Mags. 
PETER I call not it. 
Billy dials an extension. 
BILLY Art. Billy. The good news is Ricardo Rincon's heading over to the clubhouse. The bad news is you got to tell Mags he threw his last pitch for the Oakland A's last night. 
ART V/O No. 
BILLY What do you mean, no. 
ART V/O No, as in no. I'm not doing it. You do it. You did it, so you do it. Art hangs up. Billy slams the speakerphone. 
PETER It's not the phone's fault. Suzanne, we're gonna need a new speakerphone. 
BILLY We gotta catch Mags before Rincon comes over. 
He leaves. 
F120 INT. A'S LOCKER ROOM - 20 MINUTES LATER F120 
Billy comes through the clubhouse past his team suiting up to where Magnante is adjusting his knee braces next to his locker, and sits with him. 
BILLY 
MIKE -- 
MAGNANTE Hey, Billy. I know I've been struggling lately. But we're coming into the home stretch, and I promise I'm gonna turn it 
AROUND -- 
BILLY -- I need you to stop getting dressed. Magnante isn't sure he heard right, but the silence tells him he did. Eventually - 
MAGNANTE Traded? 
Billy shakes his head, no. 
BILLY I'm sorry for the crap news. I know it hurts. 
(THEN) Mike. I can't have 26 guys in the clubhouse. Magnante nods. 
BILLY That's a problem right there. Terrance jogging to first. 
(THEN) Mr. Justice. That's what we pay you for. 
(THEN) Chad Bradford, you deceptive son of a bitch, I love you. 
(THEN) He's a pain in the ass, but that Giambi gets on base. 
Another train of thought -- 
PETER Hatteberg once had 18 walks in 30 at bats. 
BILLY My whole career I only had eighteen walks. 
PETER Actually... 11. 
BILLY Shut up. 
And now we have QUICK SCENES OF BILLY TAKING PLAYERS 
ASIDE -- 
122 LOCKER ROOM--BILLY AND TEJADA - DAY 122 
BILLY Migs, let's make a deal. I'll pay you fifty bucks for every away fastball you hit to opposite field, but you've gotta pay me fifty for every one of those you pull. 
Tejada immediately starts thinking about it. 
123 INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY 123 
TERRANCE LONG is working out. Billy pokes his head in. 
BILLY Hey, T. Did your car get egged? 
LONG Yeah. 
BILLY I think I just got an e-mail from the culprit. He said he was tired of paying good money just to watch you jogging around the bases. 
LONG What the hell does that have to do with anything? 
BILLY I don't know, man. Don't worry about it. 
Billy exits. Long calls after -- 
LONG Who brings eggs to the ballpark anyway?! 
A124 INT. CLUBHOUSE HALLWAY - DAY A124 
Billy and Mecir walk down the hall with the smelly stain. 
BILLY Man, you're not fooling anyone but yourself out there. You're falling further and further behind. In your mind, what's the problem? Mecir mumbles something. 
BILLY I can't understand you with your hand over your mouth. 
MECIR Sorry, Billy. It's just, the smell... 
BILLY Right? 
(INDICATES STAIN) It's that. And it's growing. 
They stare at the stain in silence. Finally -- 
MECIR I'm gonna grab a shower. 
BILLY Yup. 
124 OMITTED 124 
125 INT. OAKLAND COLISEUM CLUB HOUSE - DAY 125 
Hatteberg in the clubhouse. Billy enters. 
BILLY Hey, Scottie. What's on your mind? 
HATTEBERG I feel like I'm hurting the team. At first base I'm making a lot of errors. I'm gonna cost us a hundred runs. 
BILLY 16.5 actually. But as a hitter, you will create 70 runs. 70 runs wins us an awful lot of ball games. I can live with that. Can you live with that? 
HATTEBERG I appreciate that, but I know you're just pulling those numbers out of your ass. 
BILLY I'm pulling them out of Pete's, actually. 
(THEN) And another thing. When a guy reaches first base, be social. 
HATTEBERG Social? 
BILLY Like a greeter at the Gap. A guy steps into your office, chat him up. You're well read, you went to college. Have some fun out there. Relax. 
HATTEBERG Yes sir. 
BILLY Scottie, you deserve to be here. 
126 INT. BILLY'S OFFICE - DAY 126 
PETER is erasing the percentage of games left that they need to win and writing in a LOWER number-- 
BILLY More information. TIME LAPSE PHOTOGRAPHY of all of the changes to the board over the following two weeks. 
127 OMITTED 127 
A128 EXT. OAKLAND COLISEUM FIELD - DAY A128 
It's the Twins vs. the A's. A TWINS PLAYER stands at first, stoic. Scott figures "What the hell?" and turns to him. 
HATTEBERG What are you guys getting up to tonight? 
The focused Twins player looks at Scott like he's crazy. 
TWINS PLAYER #1 Bed by ten o'clock. Game time. 
HATTEBERG I don't buy it. 
TWINS PLAYER #1 I'm sore, man. Beat up. Day in, day out. 
HATTEBERG Where d'you guys go next? 
TWINS PLAYER #1 Houston. 
HATTEBERG Houston? 
(THEN) You ever get up to Boundary Waters up there in Minnesota? It's beautiful. I went on a trip up there. Fishing trip. Caught some walleye. 
TWINS PLAYER #1 That's good fishing. 
CUT TO: 
Scott chatting with a DIFFERENT TWIN on first. 
HATTEBERG "Mankevich" is polish? 
TWINS PLAYER #2 Yes, sir. 
TARA What did she say? 
BILLY I was a big moment for them. You know everyone wrote him off? 
TARA You didn't. You found him and you put that together. 
BILLY I know. It was beautiful. But you know... it's not gonna mean a thing. 
He's upset. She knows it. 
BILLY Here's the thing -- we changed the game. We got this year, maybe next, then they're gonna catch on. This is our moment. I want to go the distance. I wanna shove it up the Yankees' ass. Not just the Yankees, but... these guys deserve it. 
TARA You deserve it. Honey, 20 games. It's a record. 
BILLY That's right, it's just a record. It gets buried in some book. Come on, tell me who won 19? I don't even know. It's 4th place at the Olympics. Any other team wins the World Series this year... great. We're still in the record books. But if we win, we've changed the game. We've put it on its head and shoved it up their ass. If we don't, they're gonna erase us.

163 EXT. OAKLAND COLISEUM - NIGHT 163 
The same shot as at the beginning: the Coliseum from high above, only this time the final game of the division series is being played at home. 
LEGEND: 
2002 ALDS 
DECIDING GAME 5 Minnesota Twins at Oakland A's The camera pans down the huge scoreboard. It's excruciating. The numbers on the board tell us it's been an incredibly close game but the A's are losing by one run in the bottom of the ninth with two outs and nobody on. 
Ray Durham stands in at the plate. Strike one to the Durham as we hear the venerable voice of ESPN's Joe Morgan, who's speaking post-game. 
JOE MORGAN V/O The flaw in the A's thinking, and this comes from the top of their organization-- is their failure to comprehend you have to manufacture runs in the post season. 
Durham fouls off a pitch. Strike two. 
JOE MORGAN V/O You have to steal. You have to bunt. You have to sacrifice. You have to trust in small ball, not Billy Ball. 
Durham swings at the fastball and connects, but it's a pop fly to second which a TWINS INFIELDER easily nabs. The PITCHER throws his glove in the air and the CATCHER runs out to the mound as the rest of the Twins run to the middle of the field to begin their victory celebration. 
Durham turns away and heads back to the dugout. The A's have lost the series. 
JOE MORGAN V/O They think they've devised a science to win games. They think it resides in a computer. They thumb their nose at fundamentals. At tradition. At Baseball. 
164 OMITTED 164 
A165 INT. VIDEO ROOM - NIGHT A165 
Harrowed by the defeat, PETER stares at the TV, listening to Joe Morgan. 
JOE MORGAN V/O They're bean counters in Oakland. That's bean with an "e" at the end. They're card counters at the blackjack table who forget the house always wins.

JUMP CUT TO: 
C165 INT. VIDEO ROOM - NIGHT C165 
Peter, in exhaustion, his eyes glued again to the screen watching shots (ARCHIVAL VIDEO) of euphoric Twins reveling and A's stunned at their misfortune. 
165 EXT. OAKLAND COLISEUM FIELD - NIGHT 165 
A LOCKED-OFF SHOT begins to slowly move towards the pile of celebrating players on the mound and as we near, the sound begins to fade and the PLAYERS BEGIN TO DISAPPEAR, as do the FANS and ALL OCCUPANTS OF THE COLISEUM. DRIFT in an empty stadium, towards the dugout, where the last of the CLEANING CREW brooms the floor. 
A166 INT. OAKLAND COLISEUM - NIGHT A166 
CAMERA MOVES down a dimly lit cinder block corridor, and finally into the - 
166 INT. A'S LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT - 1989 166 
where we discover a solitary figure. 
The camera comes to settle on the Oakland A's player, still in uniform, hours after the game has ended, sitting with his face in his hands. After a long, deep breath he sits up and we discover that it's Billy, 10 years prior. 
CUT TO: 
167 INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT - 1989 167 
Billy, still in uniform, walks down the long corridor that leads to the GM's office, his cleats clicking on the concrete halls. 
ALDERSON V/O This is weird, Billy. 
CUT TO: 
168 INT. SANDY ALDERSON'S OFFICE (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT - 1989 168 
BILLY's standing in front of the A's GM wearing his uniform pants and a t-shirt. 
ALDERSON It's like a politician quitting a campaign to become a staffer. Do you even know what a scout does? 
BILLY I've been scouted since I was 15. 
ALDERSON And you're ready to say, "I'm not a baseball player"? 
BILLY I'm not a baseball player. 
CUT TO: 
169 INT. BILLY'S OFFICE - DAY 169 
BILLY Ready to do this? Pete nods. Billy calls out -- 
BILLY Suzanne? Get Schott on. 
(TO PETER) You ever been to Boston? The speakerphone rings. Billy answers. 
BILLY We need to talk about the Red Sox. 
SCHOTT (V.O.) So I heard. John Henry reached out to you? 
BILLY Yes. But I haven't spoken with him yet. 
SCHOTT (V.O.) That's what he said. 
BILLY I want your blessing before I do. 
SCHOTT (V.O.) Well, how am I supposed to react to all of this? You're under contract, Billy. You extended. 
BILLY I know that, Steve, but I'd like to talk to them. I want to see what they have to say. 
SCHOTT (V.O.) You're asking me to let them talk to you? 
BILLY Yes. With your permission. 
SCHOTT (V.O.) Well, I can't do that unless I know Peter is in place as my GM. 
BILLY Pete? 
JOHN You won the exact same number of games as the Yankees but the Yankees paid 1.4 million dollars per win and you paid two- hundred and sixty thousand. Yes, I want you to be my General Manager. 
(PAUSE) I know you're taking it in the teeth. The first guy through a wall always gets hurt. But those are dying voices. Any GM that doesn't tear down their team and rebuild it using your model is gonna be a dinosaur. 
JOHN's taken a piece of paper out of his pocket and slides it to BILLY -- 
BILLY What's this? 
JOHN My first offer. BILLY opens it, looks at it for less than a second, and looks back up at JOHN... 
171 INT. LIMO - DAY 171 
Billy looks out at the Boston scenery. He steals a glance at the paper in his hand, John's offer, pensive...

176 INT. OAKLAND COLISEUM LOCKER ROOM - DAY 176 
Billy sits at a table. A baseball SLAMS down in front of him. He looks up to see where it came from. PETER is standing in the doorway. 
PETER Heads up! 
BILLY Jesus. What the hell -- 
PETER Sorry. 
BILLY What the hell was that? 
PETER I don't know. Sorry. 
(THEN) How was Boston? 
BILLY Impressive. 
PETER You're giving me Youkilis, Billy. 
BILLY Why would I ever do that? 
PETER Come on Billy, Schott's going to want something in exchange for letting you out of your contract and I want Youkilis. 
BILLY Oh, what is that, your GM voice? You can't have him. 
PETER And Cash. And a player to be named later. 
BILLY You already have my job. What else do you want from me? 
PETER I don't want your job. 
BILLY Why did you take it? 
PETER You didn't leave me much choice. 
(THEN) Did Henry make you a good offer? 
BILLY It doesn't matter. 
PETER Did he make you a good offer? 
BILLY It was fine. 
PETER What was it? 
BILLY It doesn't matter. 
Pete just stares at him. Finally, Billy reaches into his pocket, takes out the folded piece of paper and hands it to Peter. Peter looks at it... 
PETER He offered to make you the highest paid GM in pro sports. 
BILLY 
(GENUINELY 
CONFLICTED) Do I love the Red Sox? 
PETER I don't know. I've never heard you say you did. 
BILLY So why am I doing this? 
PETER You're not doing it for the money. 
BILLY I'm not? 
PETER You're doing it for what the money says. It says what it says to any player who gets big money: that they're worth it. 
BILLY The offer says that. The money itself is redundant. 
(BEAT) I made one personal decision based on money in my life and I swore to never do that again. 
PETER So you're not going to Boston? 
BILLY I haven't decided. 
PETER It's all over the news that it's a done deal. 
BILLY Look at this place. What a dump. 
(THEN) I so wanted to win here. 
PETER I think you've already won, Billy. 
BILLY No Pete, we lost. 
PETER You haven't given yourself time to get over it, it's only been three days. 
BILLY I'm not even over last year yet. I don't get over it. 
PETER 
(BEAT) I've got something in the video room, come with me. 
BILLY I really can't look at video right now. 
PETER No, come with me.

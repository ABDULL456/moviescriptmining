FADE IN: 
EXT. MANHATTAN STREETS - NIGHT 1 
SUPERIMPOSURE: 
MANHATTAN. 10.30 P.M. Park Avenue in mid-December. On the lampposts, Xmas lights sparkle over streets slick with slush and rain. Limousines line up for a public function. 
2 EXT. BLACKWOOD BUILDING - NIGHT 2 
SUPERIMPOSURE: 
BLACKWOOD'S AUCTION HOUSE Under black umbrellas, wealthy men and women exit the limos and enter a stately ten-story building. On the facade, a sign reads: TONIGHT - TREASURES OF PRE-CHRISTIAN EUROPE. A SHADOWY FIGURE lurks in an alley near the corner. His features are hidden by a broad-brimmed hat. He watches as- The guests present gleaming, golden invitations to the security people at the door. 
SHADOWY FIGURE (in Elvish, subtitled) I'll go up first. You'll enter from below- He addresses WINK, an eight-foot tall TROLL with grey skin and a huge scar over his left, empty, eye socket. His right hand is missing and he sports a heavy IRON MACE instead. A plume of breath escapes from his brutish mouth. 
SHADOWY FIGURE (CONT'D) And remember Wink- 
(BEAT) Don't be shy. He extends his arms and with a swoop, he climbs the wall, up, up, like a bat. Five floors up... 
3 INT. SALES ROOM - NIGHT 
CAMERA lingers on the bloated features of a stone FERTILITY 
GODDESS. 
HELLBOY 2 2 
AUCTIONEER Pre-Celtic votive sculpture is in granite and has been dated circa 700 B.C. Like the guests, the AUCTIONEER is dressed in formal wear. TV MONITORS display the image of the statue so the bidders can have a closer look. 
AUCTIONEER (CONT'D) We'll open the bidding at two hundred thousand dollars. A DISTINGUISHED BUYER raises his hand- 
AUCTIONEER (CONT'D) Two hundred and seventy-five, and... we have three hundred, thank you Mr. Van Hausen - Three hundred thousand once- A FEMALE BIDDER raise her hand- 
AUCTIONEER (CONT'D) And Three hundred and fifty thousand, thank you Mrs. Bernstein- As the auction carries on, a STEWARD leaves the room and heads down - 
4 INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT 4 
-a darkened corridor where other STEWARDS wheel auction lots to and from the sales room. The STEWARD notices an open window at the end of the corridor. He leans out and looks down. Ten stories below - a snow-covered alley. Suddenly, he sees the SHADOWY FIGURE above the window frame, clinging to the smooth granite wall!! 
STEWARD What the h- Quick as lightning, the SHADOWY FIGURE covers the steward's mouth. When he withdraws his hand, the steward's mouth has 
VANISHED!!! The Shadowy Figure grabs the hapless man by the lapels, hauling him outside and dangling him over the void. Far below: a spiked wrought-iron fence. 
HELLBOY 2 3 
SHADOWY FIGURE A silent human- almost as good as a dead one... 
(BEAT) Almost. He releases the STEWARD, who falls- 
-DOWN- 
-DOWN- -down- TKKCT!!! Flailing in utter silence. All the way. Onto the fence. The Figure slips through the window and moves into the- 
5 INT. SALES ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
AUCTIONEER And now, for our next item. Lot #777. Two STEWARDS wheel in an oaken box and open it. Nestled in maroon velvet is an eight-inch, ornately decorated arc of gold. 
AUCTIONEER (CONT'D) A once-in-lifetime opportunity. For the first time in auction. A piece of the Royal Crown of Bethmoora... A precious artifact dating from the Atrebatean period. Exquisite workmanship in 24 carat gold. The lights flicker briefly, provoking MURMURS from the audience. 
9 INT. HELLBOY'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS 9 
HB stumbles around the rubble, wreathed in smoke. He holds a bunch of blackened LPs and 8-track cassettes. 
HELLBOY (yelling at Liz) Look- I have one rule! One- "Don't touch my stuff -" Liz appears, shimmering in a halo of blue flame. HB's pulls a few LP albums out of the garbage bin. 
LIZ You have the same album on CD, LP and an 8 track- An 8 track!!! 
HELLBOY You can't listen to Al Green on a CD!! You just can't!! Oh, and 8 track was the way to go- one day mankind will realize its mistake. 
LIZ What about me? I need some space! Not much, but just enough to find- to find- my- toothbrush. She flares up, losing control... 
HELLBOY Is that what this is about?? Your toothbrush's right there, behind you- (Liz turns) There- there- with the cat food!! Wrinkling her nose in disgust, Liz plucks a toothbrush from a heap of spilled cat kibble. 
LIZ Damn it, Red- there's no room for me here. You can't just act like- Suddenly, the alarm SOUNDS. Hellboy is elated. 
BELLBOY 2 8 
HELLBOY Oh, heavenly bells are ringing! 
10 INT. GARAGE WEAPONS AREA, BPRD - NIGHT 
Surrounded by racks of weapons, Abe, Hellboy and Liz suit up. Tight-lipped and grumpy, Liz dons black army pants and a leather jacket. She jams an automatic handgun into her utility belt. They move into a vast garage, big as a stadium. It houses a fleet of planes, cars, boats, helicopters and tanks. They load weapons and ammo on board their usual transport/mobile quarters - a GARBAGE TRUCK. The perfect gentleman, Hellboy holds the door open for Liz. The truck interior has been refurbished with more high-tech equipment. As the engine starts and the headlights blaze... 
CUT TO: 
- NIGHT 11 
11 EXT. EAST SIDE AUCTION HOUSE 
The cops have surrounded the building and helicopters hover overhead. 
12 EXT. NEARBY ALLEY - NIGHT 
The BPRD garbage truck pulls to stop. 
13 INT. GARBAGE TRUCK - NIGHT 
Completely refurbished, with a BANK OF MONITORS and a large digital WORLD MAP, tracking each Paranormal. 
MANNING Oh, Jeez- did you see the crowds? He offers HB a couple of cigars and lights one for him. 
MANNING This is midtown Manhattan... Will you promise to be careful? You'll use discretion? 
HELLBOY 2 9 
HELLBOY Piece of cake. In and out... no one will see me. You have my word- A sarcastic guffaw from Liz. 
HELLBOY (CONT'D) 
(GLARING) I can be discreet if I want to be- They exit the truck and enter the building. Manning sighs. 
CUT TO: 
14 TNT. SALES ROOM - NIGHT 14 A BPRD agent (AGENT MUDD), Abe and Liz move into the big, dark sales room, past a jumble of overturned chairs. They use plasma-screen night-vision scanners to survey the devastation. 
LIZ No one here. No survivors. No bodies. 
NOTHING- 
15 TNT. CORRIDOR - SAME 15 Two agents lead the way down the adjacent hallway. Hellboy follows, a few feet behind. HB trains his flashlight on a fallen display case. Broken glass glitters. 
HELLBOY Same story here, babe- 
LIZ (on the intercom) Don't call me babe- 
19 EXT. EAST SIDE AUCTION HOUSE - NIGHT 19 
Manning is holding forth in a sidewalk press conference. 
MANNING The situation is completely under control. Earlier tonight, customs agents discovered a few illegally imported items. This caused a minor confrontation. The reporters go wild with questions. 
MANNING (CONT'D) Federal agents have now taken over the premises. We ask that you all step back- Manning basks in the flashbulb glow and acknowledges a pretty young REPORTER. 
HELLBOY 2 12 
MANNING (CONT'D) 
(GRINS) Yes, Debra-? 
20 TNT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT 20 Plaster spills from widening cracks in the wall. Hellboy shoots, blowing open a massive hole. He peeks inside- Small bodies burrow away like moles. 
HELLBOY What are they-? Abe? 
21 INT. INTERCUT - SALES ROOM/CORRIDOR - SAME 21 
Abe finds a human femur, wet and gnawed. 
ABE Ah, I knew it. 
(BEAT ) They're vicious and cruel and- The floor ripples with activity. 
ABE (CONT'D) Have you noticed the floor?? 
HELLBOY (looking around) Uh- thick rug, deep pile, light brown- 
ABE Red- there is no rug- Hellboy lifts his foot, realizing he's been walking on an inch-thick layer of- ahem- poo. 
HELLBOY Aw, crap- 
ABE Precisely... 
(BEAT) These things have a very active metabolism. They, um- excrete as soon as they eat and then need to eat some more. There are no corpses 'cause there are no 
LEFTOVERS- 
HELLBOY 2 13 
HELLBOY Spit it out, brother blue. What are they? 
22 INT. SALES ROOM - SAME 22 
ABE Alright, but- 
LIZ Damn it Abe, just tell us! 
ABE Okay, then- They're- um- tooth fairies. 
LIZ Abe, c'mon- cut the crap. She checks her boots, sticky with poo- 
ABE Third century, the Teutoburg forest. Famished. They feed on calcium- 
(BEAT) And they do go for the teeth first. How do you think they got that name "Tooth Fairies"?? Liz senses movement in the darkness. She holds out her hand and starts a small fire on her palm. She pans it like a torch, firelight sweeping the darkness- 
NOTHING- 
23 INT. CORRIDOR - SAME 23 
Agent MARBLE comes upon a lonely little creature peeping out from a crack in the wall. It's about 9 inches high, with olive skin and almond-shaped eyes gleaming in the half- light. It whimpers softly. 
AGENT MARBLE Hey, this guy is cute -i. He reaches out to touch it. 
KING Then, I am sorry my son- you leave me no choice. (looks at his guards) Death. His two PRAETORIAN GUARDS unsheathe their swords. 
PRINCE 
(GRIM) I agree. Death it is- And the guards turn toward the king and stab him. The Princess screams. The Prince looks away as the old monarch tumbles from his throne, dead. The heads of the clans try to flee, but are kept at bay by the other guards. 
PRINCE Hear me all!!! There are some amongst you that have already seen the light- (he nears the guards) Seen the future... The PRAETORIAN GUARDS cover his back as he leans forward to his Father"s corpse and snatches the medallion. 
PRINCE (CONT'D) As for you- You may join us in our quest or die now- His gaze is fierce, inspired. He joins the pieces together, they fuse and interconnect through the magical equivalent of NANOTECHNOLOGY. Minute gears and hooks join the pieces seamlessly into an almost complete CROWN. The Prince raises 
IT- 
PRINCE (CONT'D) All of those in favor, make it known. 
HELLBOY 2 23 All of the family heads sheepishly bow their heads, then kneel. 
PRINCE (CONT'D) Good- I see the council is as brave as it's always been... 
(BEAT) And now, my sister- The Prince looks around and sees that his sister is gone. He pushes through the mob, pulling his guards to the door. 
PRINCE (CONT'D) Find her- Find her- His minions surge into the tunnels. 
40 TNT. TUNNEL MAZE - NIGHT 40 Clutching the medallion on her chest , the Princess runs down a tunnel. A CROWD gathers behind her, chasing her as she zig-zags from tunnel to tunnel. With perfect calm, she ducks into a niche, then slides down a chute. She lands in a stone chamber lined with bookshelves. 
41 INT. PRINCESS CHAMBER - DAY 41 
The Princess rushes to a small cabinet. She grabs an ancient, leather-bound tome. She turns to leave, but a horde of TROLLS rushes and quickly surrounds her. One of the beasts swings a heavy, rusty sword. It opens a gash in the princess' left arm- 
42 INT. TUNNEL 1 - DAY 42 
The Prince, rushing through the tunnel with the PRAETORIAN GUARDS, suddenly doubles over, cursing. Blood pours from a wound in his left arm. 
PRINCE No- no- you fools- 
HELLBOY 2 24 
43 INT. PRINCESS CHAMBER - SAME 43 
As another troll lifts his sword high- 
PRINCESS (calling out) Yrdrig!! YRDRIG, a hellhound the size of a tank, jumps out from an alcove. He has multiple heads, all of them ferocious. In seconds, he's upon the TROLLS. Each of his many mouths tears into green flesh, lifting and shaking the helpless monsters like rag dolls. The Princess slips through a secret door. 
44 INT. TUNNEL 2 -- SAME 44 
The Prince and his guards rush through the tunnels, as troll screams echo off the walls. When they finally- 
45 INT. PRINCESS CHAMBER - SAME 45 
-reach the Princess' chamber, it's too late. Dead and dying TROLLS lie in a heap on the floor. The Prince finds no sign of his sister. He clutches his bleeding arm. 
CUT TO: 
46 INT. HELLBOY'S ROOM - DAY 46 
Liz sprawls on a sofa, watching the 20-odd TV monitors in Hellboy's room. All the news channels feature footage of Heliboy's "outing" the night before. HB is grinning at the camera. Now he's signing an autograph! 
HELLBOY ON TV Yes- yes- I'd say I am that strong- I've fought many creatures over the years but none as strong as me- He winks at camera. Liz rolls her eyes. 
HELLBOY 2 25 Hellboy plunks himself down next to her, popping a can of beer. 
HELLBOY I think I did good. And I looked good, don't you think, Liz? Abe stands behind them, juggling a dozen remote controls. 
ABE Look- there's Manning... He raises the volume as Manning is shown, surrounded by microphones. 
MANNING ON TV Evidently we have a- gas pocket- somewhere in- 
(OVERLAPPING) -Germans make me nervous- 
MANNING I guess they need a nice open face- A face people can trust. Finally, next to steel cage, they meet- JOHANN KRAUS: about 6' tall, dressed in a canvas containment suit full of tubes and taps. His hands are encased in thick latex gloves with exit valves at the fingertips and his head... 
MANNING . Oh, my God- 
HELLBOY 2 28 .is a translucent glass bubble, full of gas! He is studying a drawing of the royal seal we saw on the Fairy Cages. Johann approaches Liz. He takes her hand and bows. 
JOHANN Johann Kraus, at your service. His unearthly voice is velvety and warm. Almost soothing. Liz smiles. Hellboy glowers as Kraus' fishbowl head turns toward them. 
HELLBOY (whispers to manning) That's an open face for you... 
48 INT. CONTAINMENT AREA - DAY 48 
Johann pulls out one of the dead, singed Fairies. Hellboy and the others gather around him. 
JOHANN Poor things, bought and sold on the black market. Smuggled in tight, cramped cages. Let's see what they can remember- 
HELLBOY Memory gets pretty sketchy after you die- (nudges Abe) -but maybe I can be of help- Nudges Abe and starts fishing for an amulet. 
JOHANN Oh, no, no- No amulets are required. He adjusts the valves at the tips of his fingers and approaches the lock. 
HELLBOY What are you doing? 
JOHANN I can inhabit inanimate things: organic, 
MECHANICAL- 
HELLBOY 
INHABIT- 
HELLBOY 2 29 
ABE 
TELEPLASTY- 
JOHANN Exactly. A PROTOPLASMIC emanation seeps out from his fingertips, slightly deflating his body. The tendrils enter the- -"Dead" Fairy. 
JOHANN I can briefly take control of entities, both mechanical and organic and reactivate their neural system- The "dead" Fairy snarls and bares its teeth at Hellboy. Two more do the same from another pen. 
JOHANN (CONT'D) (points at Hellboy) You scare him- The fairy blabbers furiously while glaring at HB. 
HELLBOY (leering at it) Whaddayawant??? You chewed off the tip of my tail- Yes, you- 
JOHANN (CONT'D) Rough translation: He says you are rude, brutish and not too bright- 
ABE Touche. More high-pitched jabbering... Johann replaces the little fairy in the holding pen. 
JOHANN (CONT'D) Enough. it seems our little friend here remembers a noise. A very peculiar noise in the last place where his cage was traded: market sounds- 
(BEAT) Troll language- 
LIZ The troll market- ? 
HELLBOY 2 30 
JOHANN Exactly, Miss Sherman. The Fairy starts babbling uncontrollably and grows pale and weak. 
HELLBOY Jeez- your buddy there doesn't look too good. 
JOHANN I'm losing my grip on its limbic system- He feels nauseous. I'm afraid he's about to die- 
HELLBOY Wow- You have that effect on me too. The Fairy's cheekbones hollow and it finally collapses. Ectoplasm escapes its body and regroups at Johan's fingertips. 
LIZ Not just him- this whole thing you did. The TV- the reporters- 
HELLBOY I did that? 
LIZ Yes, Red- absolutely. 'Cause you did it without thinking- You just wanted to be in the public's eye- well- you're there- but so are we. 
HELLBOY Hey- We got some hate mail. 
(SHRUGS) We'll deal with it. Together. 
HELLBOY 2 33 He comes closer to her. 
HELLBOY Something else bothering you-? Liz nods quietly. 
HELLBOY So- Tell me about it- 
LIZ I will, but not now- I'm sorry if- I- 
(BEAT) I don't like being watched. I never have. I feel like a freak only if someone's watching me. Suddenly: Angry YELLS... then fists pounding the walls and fenders. The doors open and they are inundated by reporters and TV CREWS and cameras and flashes. There are, literally, hundreds of them. This time from all over the world: Japan, UK, Germany... 
CUT TO: 
52 EXT. WATERFRONT, BROOKLYN BRIDGE - NIGHT 52 
Agents cordon off the street with yellow tape, holding the press at bay. As the truck rolls by, hordes of bystanders push forward, hoping for a glimpse of Hellboy. Some of them chase run alongside the vehicle, carrying support/hatred signs. 
MANNING May I suggest that tonight you refrain from signing autographs. 
HELLBOY It's the garbage truck. It makes the wrong statement. About who we are. 
MANNING You think that's what this is about? Transportation??? 
HELLBOY 2 34 
53 EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DOCKS - NIGHT 53 
The truck stops near other official vehicles. Overhead, the soaring roadbed of the Brooklyn Bridge. At the sight of the BPRD team, some protestors throw eggs. Hellboy shields Liz from the barrage. 
REPORTER 2 C'mon- show us your powers- 
ABE Oh- No, no, no, it's not a parlor trick. 
REPORTER 1 What are you, a mermaid?? 
ABE Oh, goodness, no- I- 
REPORTER 2 You say you can read things- things about people- so read me- c'mon- read me- The crowd of reporters and onlookers laughs and applauds. 
REPORTER 2 (CONT'D) What do you see? 
ABE Very well, if you insist. (webbed hand on reporter's chest) You... keep... a large, battery-operated vibrating egg by your bedside... A shrieking CAMERA CREW runs up loaded with video equipment. 
REPORTER You! Demon-man! Will you take a DNA test? 
HELLBOY It's "Hellboy" not "Demon-man"- One of the projectiles hits him. The crowd roars. Hellboy gazes back at them- seething. 
JOHANN Let me take care of this. Johann bravely confronts the news teams and the crowd. 
HELLBOY 2 35 
JOHANN (CONT'D) Ladies and Gentlemen, my name is Johann Kraus and I beg you to allow us- (interrupted by catcalls) -Please, we need space to work- please- 
WE- The REPORTERS bombard him with questions. He signals for silence. 
JOHANN (CONT'D) In due time- very soon- we will provide all the answers you require, all the whos, whys and wherefors- But for now- An egg hits him in the face- hard. The crowd roars- 
MANNING Oh, dear Lord. 
(PAUSE) What about the cats? 
LIZ She eats them. 
MANNING "She??" That's a "she"????? 
HELLBOY We're moving in, Sparky- 
61 BOWLING ALLEY / BACK ALLEY/ UNDER THE BRIDGE 61 HE, Johann and Abe follow the Bag Lady. She opens a service 
DOOR- 
/ SERVICE CORRIDOR. 62 
62 INT. BOWLING ALLEY 
The bag lady goes through the rear of the bowling alley and through a basement door. The room RUMBLES with the sound of rolling balls and toppling pins. 
HELLBOY 
(WHISPERS) Maybe we can bowl a few frames, uh? 
ABE (splays his webbed fingers) Bowling balls- they give me trouble. 
HELLBOY How about a beer, then? Now that we're "out"- Whaddya say, Mein Herr? 
HELLBOY 2 39 
JOHANN Sorry. I don't drink. 
HELLBOY 
SHEESH- 
63 INT. BOWLING ALLEY BASEMENT 63 
Hellboy and Abe enter the basement: no sign of the old woman. Just a Warehouse- 
JOHANN' Adjust the prisms to "2" Abe moves his glasses, Hellboy fumbles his own- unsuccessfully. Now the WHOLE ROOM transforms under the new optical elements: Its geometry remains somewhat unchanged, but instead of a pile of boxes a tree trunk and a large, mossy rock are visible, where there were iron beams now tree trunks and stone columns are visible... 
ABE 
THERE- Where a large banner hung, now a huge, rusty mechanical lock. 
HELLBOY What the heck is that? 
ABE A locking mechanism- 
HELLBOY Mmh- I'll take care of it- He clenches his stone fist, rears back... 
JOHANN No- You destroy it. We'll never get in- He adjusts the valves at the tips of his fingers and approaches the lock. 
HELLBOY Ah, of course- the Fishbowl touch- 
JOHANN Johann's s ecto-tendrils enter the- 
HELLBOY 2 4 0 
64 MECHANISM OF THE LOCK -filling it, making a few complex gears turn and move- 
65 THE LOCK Opens and the floor drops away, revealing a stone staircase. Johann withdraws his protoplasmic tendrils and closes off the valves. 
JOHANN Gentlemen: welcome to Troll Market. 
77 INT. BLACKSMITH FURNACES - DUSK 77 
Lit by the fires of a hundred furnaces, stoked by scores of goblins, a MECHANICAL ARMY is born. Metal plates and moving parts are hammered into shape on enormous anvils and bolted onto tall, ornate, golden figures. 
PRINCESS (V.0.) This was an army that would not eat, drink or grow tired. A heartless, ruthless force made of the purest metal, mined from the depths of the earth. 
78 INT. COURTYARD, CASTLE - DUSK 78 
In perfect ranks, in eerie unison, the golden soldiers line up, filling the entire courtyard, awaiting the King's command. 
PRINCESS (V.0.) The Sigri worked until the winter moon was high in the sky - The CHIEF GOBLIN BLACKSMITH displays three curved segments of gold. He fits them together and holds a completed CROWN directly over the King's head. 
KING I am King Balor, leader of the Golden Army. Is there anyone here who disputes my right??? Silence. Prince NUADA kneels next to his father. The Goblin crowns the King, who lifts his sword. In response- TCHANKKKKK!!!! The new army raises its lances, hailing him. 
79 EXT. HUMAN ENCAMPMENT - NIGHTFALL 79 
As the humans make ready for battle, a tremor shakes the earth. They turn their gaze to the horizon, which bristles with the arms of the approaching troops. 
HELLBOY 2 50 
80 EXT. BATTLEFIELD - CONTINUOUS 80 
The fight is brutal. The mechanical soldiers mow down the humans by the hundreds, their swords replaced as needed by battle axes, bludgeons and lances. 
PRINCESS (V.0.) But this army knew no bounds, had no remorse, felt no loyalty, engaging in blind battle with man, woman or child. The horde crushes everything, with swords slicing through armor as if it were paper. Every blow is deadly, precise. The army marches ever onward, like a grinding machine devouring tender flesh. At length, there is no sign of life in the human camp. 
PRINCESS (V.0.) (CONT'D) And as the king gazed upon the earth awash in blood and at the impassive metal faces of the army he had created, his heart grew heavy. Victory was gained at too high a price. This war should never have been waged. The King surveys the carnage. The mechanical soldiers stand in symmetrical ranks awaiting further instructions. 
PRINCESS (V.0.) (CONT'D) And so he arranged a truce: the surviving men would keep to their cities and we children of the Earth would dwell within the forests. This pact, he declared, would be honored by our sons and the sons of their sons until the end of time. Listening to his father, Prince Nuada reacts with anguish. 
PRINCESS (V.0.) (CONT'D) But my brother did not believe in the promises of men. He marched off into exile, vowing to return if the Sons of the Earth ever needed him. Prince Nuada walks away towards a dying sunset. 
81 INT. STORAGE CHAMBER - NIGHT 
The goblins lock the golden army into a huge cavern, under the light of ten thousand flickering torches. 
HELLBOY 2 51 
PRINCESS (V.0.) And the golden army was ordered to lie dormant, locked inside the earth itself - and there it is to this day, waiting for the wearer of the crown to command it again. 
82 INT. MAPMAKER'S SHOP - NIGHT 82 
The Princess finishes her tale. Hellboy and Johann look at each other. 
HELLBOY Where is that crown?? 
PRINCESS My father had it destroyed. Cut into three pieces. One for mankind... She holds up her piece of the puzzle, which dangles from a chain around her neck. 
PRINCESS .Two for the sons of the Earth. 
ABE So, you do need our help..? 
PRINCESS I'm afraid it's the other way around. She holds the CYLINDER she purchased. 
PRINCESS The location of the Golden Army is contained within this cylinder-- She opens it and produces a parchment hidden inside. She extends it: the map just shows three coordinates. 
ABE Just a global chart, Edo - that's the old name for Tokyo - Moscow, and Renvyle here- 
PRINCESS But nothing else- She rolls back the map into the cylinder. 
PRINCESS So far, this is a family matter. To intervene will bring nothing but trouble. 
HELLBOY 2 52 
HELLBOY Good, I like trouble. 
ABE Do as I say! With a sigh, Hellboy scoops up a few. 
ABE How many do you have? 
HELLBOY Three, how about you? 
ABE Three! There's always seven! Find the last one!!! 
TO The seventh bean is next to a manhole. It hops closer edge... 
ABE Quick, it's going for water! Hellboy reaches for it... but it's too late. The thing hops into the manhole and lands somewhere below with a SPLASH. 
ABE (CONT'D) Oh, my God, evacuate the area! 
HELLBOY 2 56 
HELLBOY Abe, please, get a grip. A RUMBLE from below their feet. WHAMMMM! A HUGE TREE punches up through the pavement, overturning cars, knocking buildings off their foundations and ripping up through the Bridge overpass!! Picking up speed, the tree branches soar up, up, up... into the moonlit clouds. Hellboy approaches the massive, trunk, gazing up in fascination. Birds and creatures emerge from the inside and flutter around, grass overtakes pavement- and for a moment Chinatown looks like the Garden of Eden. 
HELLBOY (CONT'D) Whoa. Just like the story books. Manning and Liz take a few steps into it: a SQUIRREL-BEING climbs on Liz's shoulder and a couple of IRIDESCENT HUMMINGBIRDS fly around her "ala" SNOW WHITE. A small crowd starts wandering into this idyllic scenario. 
LIZ This is so beautiful- 
MANNING So- perfect- so peaceful- 
HELLBOY Hey!!! He spots. the prince, at the base of the tree. Knocking on it- 
HELLBOY Hey- Jhonny Apleseed- What are you-?? Oh- Jeez did you have to do that?? Liz starts pulling Manning away and yelling at the crowd- 
LIZ Back- Go back- right now!!! 
MANNING What? What? What is he doing-? 
LIZ He's knocking on wood- summoning an 
ELEMENTAL- 
HELLBOY 2 57 
MANNING An elem- 
LIZ A forest spirit that lives in that tree. He's releasing it- 
MANNING Oh, and is it that bad?? KKKRRRRCHTCH!!!!! The tree trunk rumbles and shakes under some enormous force. Huge LEAVES tumble to the street. Even the ever-present NEWS CREWS back away as a huge shape descends. BOOM!! the trunk rips in two, revealing a curled, dormant 
ELEMENTAL. Five stories high- Fierce as nature. THE ELEMENTAL steps out of the tree and stares at Hellboy. Uttering a weird, guttural SOUND, the Giant raises an arm and pulverizes a GASOLINE TRUCK! WHUMP- ! Flames leap up! The Elemental grins with delight, turning his baleful gaze on the Princess. As she shrinks back, her pet Yrdrig rushes at the thing, snarling. In a single leap, it sinks its teeth into the Elemental's heel. 
HELLBOY Good dog. (to Elemental) Now, Woody... You want to fight someone, you fight with me. Hellboy humorously adopts a kung fu pose, as in Bruce Lee. The Elemental hops forward, New branches sprout from his limbs, shaking the Yrdrig off. 
ABE (to the Princess) This may not be the best place for you, your majesty. With your permission... He offers the Princess his arm. She takes it and allows Abe to lead her away. A moment later, the Elemental smashes the ground where they had been standing! Every time the ELEMENTAL moves, he trails behind roots and branches. The roots connecting to its feet and leading to the original tree trunk, like an umbilical cord. Johann sees this- 
HELLBOY 2 58 
JOHANN I have a plan- He looks at Abe- 
87 STANDING AT THE GARBAGE TRUCK 87 -as the fishman helps the Princess up into the rear of the BPRD garbage truck. Up front, behind the wheel, Liz starts the engine. 
88 ABANDONED BUILDING 
Hellboy climbs a fire escape as the Elemental's arm/branches extend and grow over the ladder, pulling it down below his feet. Hellboy ducks into one of the open windows as the Elemental tears away the rest of the scaffolding. Growing and discarding branches and roots. 
89 INT. ABANDONED BUILDING - CONTINUOUS 89 
Hellboy runs like a cockroach through a dilapidated KITCHEN. Behind him, the Elemental's massive BRANCH/FIST crashes through the wall, then pursues him as he runs down a corridor littered with debris. Like a wrecking ball, the Elemental demolishes each section of the corridor as Hellboy runs. 
90 EXT. LEDGE - CONTINUOUS 90 
102 INT. HELLBOY'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Liz is patching Hellboy's injured head. In the background the TV's are playing up: CITY LIGHTS, WHITE HEAT and some TV programming. 
HELLBOY He caught me off-guard- but I'll get him next time. He's examining a few letters, contract forms, etc. 
LIZ There shouldn't be a "next time" we're all part of the same team. 
HELLBOY 2 68 
HELLBOY We are- he's not- The guy's an egomaniac. You can see right through him. 
(PAUSE) That's a joke, Liz. Liz remains silent. 
HELLBOY (raises a letter) Look!! They wanna do a cartoon series, based on me? And this: (he holds up a box of cereal) Product endorsement - breakfast of demons. And a videogame!!! As CITY LIGHTS ends, Liz lifts the remote to turn the volume up. 
LIZ Gosh, that was so sweet, so sad- It always gets me- Red- There's something I need to- 
HELLBOY (taking the remote) No, wait. (switching to Leno) Look that's us- Jay is showing some footage from the giant incident. 
LENO So- this "Hellboy" what is he?? Is he really on our side?? I mean, he's red, has a tail and shaves his horns- horns, Ladies and Gentleman. Horns are never a good sign. 
HELLBOY 
(CHUCKLES) Ha- He's funny. 
LENO Maybe we should have him come over and talk to us a little, uh? Whaddayathink?? The crowd roars. 
HELLBOY That's a great idea, don't you think?? 
HELLBOY 2 69 
LIZ No, I don't- 
HELLBOY Did you know that during the commercial breaks the orchestra keeps playing so the guest can't talk to Jay... keeps the conversation fresh. 
LIZ How do you know these things? 
HELLBOY I read it in TV Guide. 
LIZ You're really liking this, aren't you? 
HELLBOY We should do this- 
LIZ It's a bad idea. All of it- Do you really need everybody to like you?? What's in it for you?? Are we not enough??? She leaves. Hellboy glances at Leno on TV: a dog outfitted in a ballerina costume is jumping around with a red ball balanced on its nose. Hellboy chuckles. 
HELLBOY That's funny. 
CUT TO: 
103 EXT. BALCONY BPRD - NIGHT 103 
Liz is looking out into Trenton NJ's light landscape. Johann approaches her. 
JOHANN Are you alright-? Liz nods weakly. 
JOHANN May I be of assistance?? 
LIZ Maybe. 
HELLBOY 2 70 
JOHANN He's a big brute, isn't he?? Liz chuckles. 
JOHANN But he has a good heart. I know it. He means well. 
HELLBOY Liz and I- we had a fight- 
ABE 
OH- Hellboy eyes the CD player. 
HELLBOY Did I hear Barry Manilow just now? 
ABE (smiles hypocritical) Barry M- oh, Gosh- no- no- (fast, stammering) It was er- urm- Vivaldi. Il cimento dell'armonia I believe I particularly admire the passage... Hellboy hits the eject button on Abe's CD player. The music stops and he pulls out a different CD from the changer. 
HELLBOY What's happening to you?? 
ABE Ooh- Ooh- 
(SIGHS) All my life I thought I was alone, a made- up name and a random pasted on a cylinder. But then I saw her- She's like me. A creature from another world... Alone... Brother Red- I think I'm in love. 
HELLBOY You say that like it's a good thing. (looks at the CD) What track? 
ABE 
(ASHAMED) Track eight- 
HELLBOY 
(READS) Oh, God- you're disgusting- 
ABE I know- 
HELLBOY 2 74 
HELLBOY "Can't smile without you" 
ABE I'd cry, but I don't have the glands for it.. 
(DESPERATE) What am I going to do, Red???? Hellboy sighs and pops a beer, presses play and sighs heavily, looks around- 
ABE I miss him- Father- don't you?? 
HELLBOY 
(NODS) Everyday. 
ABE He would tell what to do- He would tell what's right- what's wrong- 
HELLBOY He did that for all of us... The opening strings of "Can't Smile Without You." 
ABE (sips beer) You know? I- I never much appreciated Manilow's artistry that much- until now- Now it seems to be a grand poet and speaks directly to my innermost feelings. 
HELLBOY Jeez- You need to get out more- The two of them sit there, growing quiet, listening to the syrupy music. Then, slowly, the two of them start singing: low at first and then at the top of their voices, moved and teary-eyed. 
110 INT. PRINCESS ROOM AT BPRD - NIGHT 
The Princess hears the distant music and smiles, but then feels a chill down her spine. She shudders and moves to the panoramic window and gazes outside, to the woods and the distant city lights below... 
HELLBOY 2 75 
EXT. BPRD - NIGHT 111 
The music can be heard at a distance. A dark figure stands on a hill, amid the trees, listening and watching... CAMERA MOVES IN: the Prince gazes at the building. 
CUT TO: 
112 INT. BPRD CORRIDOR - DAY 
Manning strides down the corridor, followed by the BPRD team. All of them dressed in BLACK LEATHER OUTFITS. 
MAKEUP GIRL They said, you're too normal. You don't need anything. 
MANNING But- Believe me- I'm not normal at all... 
CAMERA MOVES to the next makeup chair, where Makeup Girl holds a camelhair brush and stares dubiously at Abe. 
MAKEUP GIRL 2 So, what color is that- green? 
ABE Carribbean Blue, actually. CAMERA MOVES to the next makeup chair, where the very sexy Makeup Girl 3 gingerly touches Hellboy's chest. 
MAKEUP GIRL 3 Are these really scars? 
HELLBOY Well, yeah. Each one tells a story- His grin fades as he sees Johann talking to Liz. He abruptly gets up and goes to them. 
HELLBOY 2 78 
HELLBOY That about you, glass-man? A few squirts of Windex? 
JOHANN I'm not going on. And if I may- a word of 
ADVICE- (long beat, then sotto voce) -it's not a good idea to hint that you two have... a relationship. 
HELLBOY Thanks a bunch. I'll decide that. 
JOHANN You don't know how people may react. 
HELLBOY It's a love story. They'll lap it up. 
JOHANN I know you don't like me, but trust me on this one. 
(BEAT) I knew your father- he was a friend- Hellboy blinks, taking the information in. 
JOHANN Do as you may- But know this- he wouldn't have approved of your behaviour. A P.A. opens the door. 
P.A. You're on-! 
JOHANN I'll be watching from the truck lab, where I belong- Go, enjoy your fifteen minutes... He walks away. 
CUT TO: 
116 INT. MOSCOW SUBWAY - NIGHT 
SIGN: PATROVICK STATION, MOSCOW, 22.00 HOURS. A busy Moscow Subway station, not very crowded at this time of night. Sleepy patrons await the arrival of the subway. 
HELLBOY 2 79 One of them, a puppet vendor, showcases his product. He manipulates a wooden marionette: A KNIGHT in SHINING ARMOR. In the distance- lights, bright lights and the train ROAR!!! The Puppeteer readies his merchandise bag and quickly moves to the edge of the platform alongside other passengers. The lights grow in intensity and the ROAR becomes deafening. But something's wrong, really, wrong- 
PUPPETEER Hooy na ny! The lights are in reality, the eyes of a giant dragon and it roars into the platfrom, demolishing pillars, crushing people and eating the puppeteer in a matter of second. Pandemonium ensues. 
117 INT. GARBAGE TRUCK LAB - NIGHT 
A warning light goes off on the Truck's GLOBAL POSITIONING 
MAP: "MOSCOW" But Johann and the other agents are too absorbed watching the Leno show on the bank of monitors. 
LENO Ladies and gentlemen, yesterday we saw some extraordinary things on TV. And tonight you're in for more. 
CUT TO: 
118 TV SHOW Jay Leno grins and pulls his microphone close. 
LENO Please extend a warm, warm welcome to Hellboy, Liz Sherman, Abe Sapien, and Special Agent Tom Manning. Uproarious applause as the BPRD team comes out and make their way to the couch. 
119 INT. BPRD CONFERENCE ROOM - SAME 
Alone in the BPRD conference room, the Princess is watching the show. The massive Yrdrig is curled up at her feet. 
CUT TO: 
123 EXT. MOSCOW STREETS - SAME 123 
Red Square, Moscow now seen in similar, shaky video. Hundreds of citizens are running from a towering, DRAGON. 
ANNOUNCER 2 This is CNN in Moscow, where a Dragon has laid claim to Red Square. Yes- a DRAGON. 
HELLBOY 2 83 The DRAGON heads towards the TV REPORTER and screeching, it raises its PAW. 
ANNOUNCER 2 Oh, my God... CAMERA goes down, then the picture winks out. Black screen. The HISS of static... PAN off the monitor to Jay Leno, who sits in stunned silence, like everyone else. Finally, he looks over at Hellboy. 
LENO Friends of yours? 
HELLBOY 
(GROWL) No -! 
LENO Then, may I ask what you're doing here? Shouldn't you be out protecting humanity instead of hooking up with our women? At last, Hellboy explodes. Bellowing, he rips up the desk and throws it through the backdrop! 
CUT TO: 
124 TNT. BPRD - SAME The Princess snaps off the TV, looking worried. Alone with her thoughts, she examines the curved gold piece hanging from a chain around her neck. She closes her eyes and shudders - trouble is near. The Yrdgrig wakes up and whimpers. 
125 INT. BPRD CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS 
Video cameras record the journey of the Princess as she makes her way through the nearly-deserted corridors. 
126 TNT. LIBRARY -- CONTINUOUS 126 A VIDEO surveillance camera in the BPRD library records the Princess as she crosses to Abe's tank. 
BELLBOY 2 84 She hides the gold segment within the pages of "Jane Eyre." At that moment, the Yrdrig GROWLS - 
PRINCESS Shhh, it's all right - BOOM-! A jolt shakes the room. A-moment later, a wall collapses as warty, heavily muscled ARMS and FINGERS tear at the masonry! in seconds, a squad of TROLLS pulls itself into view! WINK leers at the Princess. From her waistband, she produces a long, thin DAGGER and wields it timidly. Somewhere in the building, ALARMS start clanging. The Yrdrig shakes himself into action and springs. With a SNARL, it attaches its several jaws onto the nearest trolls. As the fighting creatures crash into the spiral staircase, the Princess hears a familiar voice: 
PRINCE Hold. The Prince steps into the room, carrying a long spear. The trolls are on top of the Yrdrig, ready to kill him. 
PRINCE Come-! The trolls release the Yrdrig and bound over to the Prince. The last troll, however, grabs the Yrdrig by the neck and brutally twists -! The animal's three mouths yelp and cough, fighting for air. - the It thrashes pathetically until, suddenly, it's over beast is dead. 
PRINCESS No! 
PRINCE Where is your sense of shame? You mingle with... the liars? 
127 INT. BPRD GARAGE - SAME 127 
ALARMS are ringing as the Hummers pull into the underground parking garage. Manning and Hellboy jump out of their vehicle and see - 
HELLBOY 2 85 - a couple of dead AGENTS sprawled on the loading dock. 
MANNING What in God's name- ? Hellboy, Abe, Liz and Johann race past him, disappearing into the building. The alarm bells are deafening. 
128 INT. BPRD CORRIDOR 128 
Hellboy leads the way down the corridors, which are alive with scrambling personnel. Several BPRD employees are lying on the floor, wounded and confused. 
129 INT. LOBBY 129 
The top-level human agents are clustered in the lobby, their guns drawn, all of them aiming at the Prince and his drooling bodyguards. Standoff. As Hellboy and the team arrive, Abe sees the Princess, her arms tied. Her brother holds her by the hair. 
ABE Princess! Without thinking, he darts forward. Instantly, one of the trolls swipes at him, its claws just missing his chest- 
HELLBOY Abe! No, get back!! Abe regains his balance and tries again, his eyes glued to the desperate features of the beautiful young woman. Hellboy manages to restrain him. 
PRINCESS Mr. Sapien, don't! He'll kill you! 
PRINCE I'll kill you all, if that's what you want. 
HELLBOY 2 89 
135 INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT 135 
Abe enters the dark, soaking library and surveys the ruins of his tank. He goes directly to one of the book stands, which lies in pieces on the floor. He comes up with his copy of "Jane Eyre." He opens it to Chapter 23 and finds the gold piece. 
LIZ Any luck? Liz has come in behind him. Abe quickly palms the precious thing in his webbed hand. 
ABE No. Sorry. 
LIZ It doesn't matter. 
ABE No -? 
LIZ No. Forget the gold piece. Let's us just find this royal asshole. 
(FIERCE) Fire and water, me and you, Abe. We'll kick his ass. Abe looks supremely troubled. 
LIZ Abe, let's do this for Red! Abe nods, unable to find a good answer. He manages to tuck the gold piece into his belt. 
CUT TO: 
136 INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER 136 
Abe stands at a lectern. Behind him, a projected image of the Princess' map from the troll market. His finger traces the strange, elvish text. 
HELLBOY 2 90 
ABE The map contained within the cylinder seems useless- 
(BEAT) Now the case itself proves very useful- He moistens the holding cylinder case on a rubber stamp mat and imprints the surface pattern on the paper map. Glyphs and coordinates become visible. A silhouette of a twisted, gnarly tree is visible too. 
ABE Renvyle it is- Both the Princess and her brother were born there. They hold it sacred. 
MANNING Even if you're right, we sit tight and locate the gold piece, make sure he never ever gets his hands on it. If there's any truth to this legend, the fate of the world depends on it. 
LIZ What about Red?? Don't you care about him??? A moment of silence. Nobody knows what to say. Finally: 
JOHANN Liz. That may be his destiny. Manning is right: we can't take the chance. Liz glares at him. 
LIZ I see. Red was right about you. Welcome to the team, Johann. And goodbye. She leaves the room. 
CUT TO: 
137 INT. HB'S ROOM - LATER 137 
Hellboy leans weakly against the doorway to his room. His cats purr all around him, oblivious to his pain. He sits by the bed. Liz enters the room. He smiles weakly at her- 
HELLBOY 2 91 
HELLBOY Don't worry, Sparky- It's all going to be 
ALRIGHT- Abe stands nearby, in silence. Liz looks at him, teary-eyed. 
ABE We'll make it alright. Screw Manning- You are right, Liz- We should just do this together: the three of us. Liz smiles.

Abe's sitting in the pilot's seat, leafing through the massive airplane manual. 
148 SIGN:REYNVILLE,IRELAND. 148 The back doors of the cargo plane opens and out come Abe and 
JOHANN- 
149 EXT. GREEN FIELD - DAY 149 
Liz and Abe help Hellboy up to a gnarled TREE, twisted by eons of wind. Abe unfurls the map and points at a drawing of a similar, weird tree. 
ABE This should be the portal. By all rights- Johann reaches the tree and inspects it carefully. 
JOHANN Abe, bring the mapcase over here. He's found a roundish SLOT in the tree, where the lowest branch joins the trunk. Abe slips the map back into its crystal cylinder and holds it alongside: it looks to be a perfect fit. 
LIZ Yes! Try it, Abe- 
HELLBOY 2 95 
JOHANN Before you do anything... remember what we're in for. A world unlike anything we've ever known. Dangerous, deceptive... 
LIZ You're wasting time! Abe inserts and twists the cylinder. The tree comes to life, hauling its roots out of the ground, bending them into a swaying arch. 
JOHANN Dangerous, deceptive... and hard to leave. They walk under the tree roots, into... 
150 FAIRY WORLD A transformed landscape. A perpetual nightland- Still overlooking the same ocean, but now throbbing with pale colors and twisted, Rackahm-esque contours. The men start down the hill, into a valley bordered by a rugged coastline. 
CUT TO: 
151 EXT. INLET - DAY 151 
The team reaches the stony shore of a mile-wide inlet. Abe brings out the map. 
ABE (pointing to the opposite shore) Renvyle is over there. They glance up and down the beach, looking for a boat. Hellboy blinks and sniffs the air. A GOBLIN speaks up from an outcropping of rocks in the shallows directly in front of them. By his side, sitting atop of a tree: A SATYR and a CROW observe the group. 
GOBLIN I bid you welcome, strangers. Would you be seeking safe passage to Renvyle? 
BELLBOY 2 96 
LIZ Yes! Can you help us? 
JOHANN 
(QUIET) Careful, Liz. 
SATYR I'm sure you can come to an understanding! The Goblin heaves on an oar and emerges from behind the rocks. He's standing in the stern of a sturdy little coracle. Its wooden hull is painted in Celtic patterns. 
GOBLIN Room enough for all of you! (looks at Hellboy) Even your weary friend. 
JOHANN What will it cost, boatman? The Goblin smiles, displaying a disconcerting row of triangular teeth. 
GOBLIN Ah, next to nothing! Make me an offer. Abe, Johann and Liz confer among themselves: 
LIZ How much? 
CROW He won't want money. 
JOHANN (to the goblin) I have a... belt! 
OF Johann removes his equipment belt, dangling it in front the creature's bat-like face. 
GOBLIN I have no use for such a thing. Liz shows him her binoculars. 
LIZ Here... is a wonderful set of eyes, magic eyes that will bring the world- 
HELLBOY 2 97 
GOBLIN I already have binoculars! No, I see something special. He points toward Hellboy's chest. 
LIZ We're never going to make them all happy, Red. What we have is ours and no one 
ELSE'S- 
BELLBOY I can turn my back on the world. I don't care anymore I don't- as long as you stay with me- as long as you think I'm still a good man. 
(BEAT ) Am I a good man, Liz?? Am I?? 
LIZ Yes you are. You are the best man I've ever met. 
HELLBOY You still seem sad. Is there anything you want to tell me-?? 
LIZ Yes, there is- 
HELLBOY Say it now, then. Whatever it is, I'm ready. 
(SIGHS) Is it about Johann- 
LIZ No- no- what are you talking about?? Before she can go on, Johann appears. He carries a poultice and fresh rags. 
BELLBOY 2 101 
JOHANN Abe and I have found the entrance to the Golden Army's resting place- Liz come with us- (looks at Hellboy) You should stay behind and get some rest- 
HELLBOY And call you in the morning, right?? Like Hell I will. I'm keeping an eye on you, 
GLASSHOLE- 
CUT TO: 
155 EXT. HILLS - DAY 
Johann, Liz and Hellboy follow a rugged trail along a bluff high over the sea. Johann refers to the map, then points to the cave opening a half-mile ahead. Abe is standing there, 
WAVING- 
JOHANN There. Abe points at the violent sea below- 
ABE The only way in- I'm afraid we'll have to jump in- (looks at Hellboy) Can you make it-? Hellboy nods. 
BELLBOY Strange. If this is the entrance- 
ABE I know- Why isn't there more security?? With a ROAR, WINK!!!!! - jumps out and throws a CHAIN around Bellboy's neck! The chain is connected to his IRON MACE which now dangles around Hellboy's neck. The two creatures battle each other fiercely. WINK's MACE destroys a nearby tree, like a wrecking ball and it connects twice with Hellboy's head. But Red gets the upper hand quickly, snapping the chain in two and twirling the mace like a boleador. 
HELLBOY 2 102 He hits Wink again and again- 
HELLBOY See?? It hurts!!! It hurts!!! Hellboy grips the chain, pulls the creature close, then, like a weightlifter, raises him high overhead. With a mighty GRUNT, Hellboy tosses him overboard. WINK hits the jagged rocks once- twice- thrice- 
HELLBOY Ouch- ouch- ouch- (looking around) We better go swimming before any more ugly fellas show up- He stares down into the swirling waters and discreetly takes his hand to his bandaged side: He's bleeding. The wound has re-opened. 
ABE Red, are you-? 
HELLBOY Don't say a word, Blue- Let's move on- 
156 UNDERWATER Johann plunges in from above, his body quickly tumbled by the rough seas. A moment later, Liz and Hellboy are in the water, too. Johann swims down, leading them into the darkness of the cave entrance. 
157 INT. CAVE ENTRANCE - SAME 157 
As they bob up for air, they find there's only a few inches of breathing room between the sea and the rocky ceiling. Liz starts coughing. 
JOHANN Hang on, people. I'll be right back. 
158 UNDERWATER Johann dives down to find a rusting, iron LOCK six feet under the surface. He tries to turn the control wheel, but can't make it budge. 
BELLBOY 2 103 Seconds later, Hellboy is at his side, gripping the wheel in his huge hands. Using all his strength, Hellboy finally manages to turn it. His bandage, however, floats free... and his wound opens up, emitting a plume of blood. Lungs bursting, he shoots to the surface. Johann stays behind and swings open the lock, revealing... 
ABE 
(APPROACHING) Here... For her... Take it... 
JOHANN Oh, my God. What has he done? Keeping his eyes on the Princess, Abe gives the gold piece to the Prince. Hellboy steps forward, feeling dizzy and betrayed. 
HELLBOY Abe - 
ABE (to Hellboy) You cannot fight him- not without hurting her... 
(BEAT ) What would you do if it was Liz?? CLICK! The Prince fits the gold parts together and places the resulting crown on his head! 
PRINCE I am Prince Nuada and I command my army to life once more. Does anyone dispute my right? With the deep sound of gears, ratchets and springs, the army comes to life. Up comes the lances and shields. 
PRINCE (CONT'D) (points at the team) Kill them. Abe is now aghast, seeing the Prince drag his sister back. 
ABE (to the Prince) That was your price!! A ransom, you said - paid in good faith!! 
(MORE) 
HELLBOY 2 107 ABE(continued) (to Hellboy) Why, he lied to us! 
HELLBOY Abe old buddy. If we survive this, we need to talk. The Army swings into action, marching toward them. The four friends retreat, soon pressed against one of the walls. 
ABE He - he's a cad! Can you imagine, a highborn heir to the throne, last in a noble line of- 
BELLBOY Not now, Abe, okay? The first phalanx of golden soldiers is upon them, their terrifying weapons slashing in unison. Hellboy brings out his huge gun and starts firing as Johann grabs a torch and swings it like a club. A couple of the mechanical soldiers go down, only to pop back onto their feet, new weapons blossoming on their arms. 
LIZ Let me - Liz summons up a white-hot burst of electrical fire in each hand. With a yell, she unleashes a searing EXPLOSION at the oncoming fighters. The shock wave rolls through the enemy ranks, flattening scores of soldiers. For a moment, the BPRD team regains hope... but the endless lines of mechanicals keep coming, marching on and over their scorched comrades. Hellboy holsters the Samaritan and rushes forward, giving it his best. His wound is running with fresh blood. He punches a soldier, whose mace pounds repeatedly against his ravaged chest; as blood spatters his face, Hellboy groans and keeps fighting, to absolutely no effect. At length, the mechanical arms throw Hellboy against the wall, where he collapses, unable to carry on. 
JOHANN Invincibility!? So - the only one thing may stop them - Johann unzips his suit; with a HISSS, his ectoplasmic self flows out, into the body of the nearest mechanical soldier! 
HELLBOY 2 108 Instantly, the thing whirls on its companions and starts chopping! Bits and pieces of gold machinery fly about as Johann rips into the enemy!! But again, fresh metal soldiers fill in for the fallen. As the BPRD team watches in dismay, Johann's mechanical shell is surrounded by the other SOLDIERS, who methodically dismember it like marauding insects! As the parts drop to the floor, twitching and useless, Johann slithers out and re-inhabits his suit. 
JOHANN Ach. They are too many. Anyone have another idea? Hellboy grabs the nearest sword and hauls himself to his feet. 
HELLBOY (a bellow) Prince Nuada: I challenge your right to command this army! With a soft BOOM, the clockwork troops come to a halt! All the mechanical heads turn toward the Prince, who stands on a ledge with his sister. 
ABE (follows HB) No= please- no- Hellboy moves away from him. 
HELLBOY A challenge must be answered! Raise your sword! 
PRINCE A challenge from you? A nobody?? You are no one. 
PRINCESS No!! He is Anung-un-Rma- son of the Fallen one- He has the right! Her eyes lock with Abe's: there's no other way. The Prince sees Hellboy coming and with a bitter smile picks up his sword. 
HELLBOY 2 10 9 
PRINCE Very well. (to the BPRD team) May his fate show you the cost of pride and blindness. As the hall rings with their first blows of their swords- 
JOHANN Hellboy's too weak- Summoning up his last ounce of strength, Hellboy manages to drive the Prince back into the center of the arena, where they fight under the inscrutable gaze of the golden army. Every time Hellboy gets a clean shot at the Prince, Abe looks at him, pleading, and HB has no choice but to keep parrying off his enemy. Hellboy's sword grows heavy in his hands; he stares at it in dismay as it trembles. His muscles can no longer respond. The Prince is ready to kill him. 
LIZ (witness to a nightmare) No!! NO! ! A sudden movement at the ledge, where the Princess steps forward and... Using her concealed DAGGER, she STABS HERSELF in the right arm!! In silent slow motion, she drops the dagger. Instantly, the Prince drops his arm... his hands come away red with blood. He looks over at his sister. They share a hard look of mutual understanding. Love and hatred. Hellboy raises, through supreme effort, bleeding. He quickly raises his sword. The fight resumes, but this time, HB has the advantage. He fights bravely and after parrying fiercely with the Prince, he disarms him and points his sword at his chest. 
HELLBOY I- have- won- 
PRINCE No. You have not- 
HELLBOY 2 110 He impales himself on HELLBOY's sword. The blade goes through his abdomen and protrudes on the other side. Hellboy pulls it out, but it's too late. Both the Prince and the Princess collapse to the ground, mortally wounded. 
ABE 
(GASPS) 
NO- Abe hurries to the Princess. Takes her into his arms, blinking in despair. The pale young creature is now a ghostly white. She lifts her eyes to Abe's, caressing his thin, scaly face.

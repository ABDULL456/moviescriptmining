SICARIO 
Written by 
Taylor Sheridan 
A MAN, standing waist-deep in the surf. White shirt, neck tie, hair perfectly parted. Wire framed glasses rest on the bridge of his nose. His name is ALEJANDRO. 
He rises his face to the sun. 
ALEJANDRO(V.O.) I think about the price. The price of appetite. The cost of forgetting who we are. Pretending we are... who we will never be... 
He looks young for 35, but his eyes -- seems they lived for decades before him. He closes them, bathing his face in sunshine. 
ALEJANDRO (V.O.) So easy to pretend we are not to blame. That a demon enters us. No... The demon is inside. We just make potions that release it. 
The muscles of his neck tense. 
ALEJANDRO (V.O.) There's no revenge for all they have taken. No justice. It simply is... 
His lip curls. His eyes open. He looks down. 
ALEJANDRO (V.O.) And still. They must be forced to look at all they have destroyed. By having the same done to them. Or they will forget... Forget they are human. Believe they are as different as they feel... Then they are the lion, and everything we loved and lost, simply its meal. 
We hear SPLASHING and the panicked gasps of a man trying not to drown. 
Only now do WE SEE: Alejandro is holding someone under the water. 
He lets the drowning man catch a breath, barely. Pushes him back under. Looks out. Lost in thought. 
We watch from the beach as Alejandro stands in the ocean to his belly, the sun high overhead. 
CUT TO: 
YESTERDAY. 
-- FRAME IS FILLED WITH A BLUE EYE, AS BLUE AS THE OCEAN -- 
The eye blinks, and we can almost feel a breeze -- we are that close. 
WOMAN'S VOICE (Whispered) Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy Name. Thy Kingdom come... 
A VERTICAL LINE OF WHITE LIGHT invades us, then grows. The eye disappears in it's wake. 
WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D) Thy will be done, on Earth as it is in Heaven. 
TWO DOORS swing open. We see the silhouettes of TWELVE PEOPLE DRESSED FOR BATTLE, rifles at the ready, barrels pointing up. CAMERA is so close to the woman's face, it almost touches her. Her lips are moving, silently reciting... 
We are in a SWAT ASSAULT VEHICLE. It is MOVING BACKWARDS fast and slams through a faded picket fence. Stops in the yard of a crumbling house. 
They all rise and leap from the vehicle. 
EXT. TRACT HOUSE -- PHOENIX -- DAY. 
WE ARE RIGHT BEHIND THE WOMAN, who mumbles the prayer as she runs. The back of her vest reads: FBI. Her name is KATE MACY. 
MACY Give us this day... our daily bread... 
They reach the door, a shotgun BLASTS THE HINGES. It falls like a drawbridge. 
MACY (CONT'D) And forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. 
She speaks the prayer faster, desperate to finish before she has to kill anyone, or be killed herself. 
MACY (CONT'D) And lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil... 
SWAT officers rush in, screaming. 
Macy's turn: She runs through the busted door- 
INT. TRACT HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS. 
In the hallway now. The chaos is closer. She hurries the words. So close now... 
MACY (CONT'D) For Thine is the Kingdom the power and glory forever and ever amen DOWN MOTHER FUCKER!! DOWN DOWN DOWN!!! 
Two LATINO MEN, 20'S, are slammed to the ground. Another LATINO comes from nowhere, throwing himself on an AFRICAN AMERICAN MAN wearing an FBI vest. A taser is pressed to his neck and he falls, paralyzed, backward. 
Macy takes in the chaos, then pushes farther into the house, running past a bedroom with an open door. 
MACY No. 
Jennings and Phil reach her. 
JENNINGS You okay? 
MACY I'm fine. 
MACY (CONT'D) Wanna give me the tour? 
She doesn't but she will. 
INT. TRACT HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS. 
No dry wall anywhere now: the walls have been stripped to the frame, exposing another DOZEN BODIES. CORONERS in protective suits remove them as DETECTIVES photograph the scene. The smell is atrocious. 
PHIL Looks like Sinaloa... 
Jennings nods and sighs. 
JENNINGS Yeah. (To a coroner) How many total? 
CORONER Between here and the hall we have thirty, but there's more in the back bedroom and we haven't looked in the attic or under the crawl space. 
JENNINGS (To Phil) Call DOJ in Washington, let em know what we have. 
Phil nods, pulls his cell and steps away. 
JENNINGS (CONT'D) This one of the houses owned by Manuel Diaz? 
MACY No way to connect him, but he owns it. 
The smell is getting to Reggie. Doesn't look like he's going to make it... 
MACY (CONT'D) Go ahead and step out, it's okay. 
Don't have to tell him twice. 
Jennings walks to the wall. Studies the faces -- one in particular, tinted an ashy green from lye and months of decay -- his mouth open wide and eyes shut so tight that his brow is a tangle of wrinkles, as though he is suffering his death for eternity. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. TRACT HOUSE -- BACKYARD -- CONT. 
We see a GARAGE, and to it's left A STORAGE SHED. AN OFFICER yanks boxes and garbage from it, tossing it on the driveway. He reaches the floor, which is covered with rubber matts. He pulls one up and discovers a 3' X 3' piece of plywood hinged to the floor and locked. 
OFFICER I NEED BOLT CUTTERS. 
They are brought over and the lock is cut. The officer kneels down. Lifts the hatch a little. Looks under, flashlight in hand... 
-- WE ARE UNDERNEATH THE PLYWOOD, FLASHLIGHT IN OUR EYES -- 
As the hatch is lifted -- TWO HOOKS with wires are visible to our left and right. As the hatch is lifted, the wires pull tighter... We see where they lead: TWO GRENADES. 
INT. TRACT HOUSE -- HALLWAY -- CONT. 
Jennings and Macy walk down the hall. Jennings stops at the body of the man Macy killed, then notices -- 
Through a screen door at the end of the hall -- officers rushing toward the shed. 
JENNINGS PD found something. 
Macy and Jennings walk outside. As the sunlight hits them, the officer open the hatch, the wires pull tight and we hear a `clink'. 
-- THE GRENADES EXPLODE. TWO OFFICERS BLOWN TO OBLIVION -- 
Dust, debris, smoke, and pieces of them roll toward Jennings and Macy like a wave, swallowing them. 
Our entire world is filled with a brown cloud and screams... 
CUT TO: 
INT. MANUEL DIAZ'S HOUSE -- DAY. 
We see children splashing and playing in a large pool through enormous windows in MANUEL DIAZ'S living room. As we pull back, we hear the sounds of a NEWS REPORT. 
NEWS REPORTER (V.O.) Phoenix police have released no details, but there HAS BEEN an explosion at a house in South Phoenix. 
CAMERA PIVOTS and we are looking at a TV across a flawlessly decorated living room. Aerial footage of the tract house and obliterated storage plays. 
MATT He's a little green. You've been kicking doors longer. 
She looks back at Reggie. 
MATT (CONT'D) Makes you feel better to have him around, he can tag along after we get back from El Paso. 
He smiles. She takes this in. 
JENNINGS Kate. You must volunteer for an interagency task force... Think very hard before you respond ... You want to be a part of this? 
Jennings' eyes beg her to say no. But the hunter in her is awake. She looks back at Reggie -- his eyes are full of concern... 
MACY We get an opportunity at the men responsible for today? 
MATT The men who are REALLY responsible. 
MACY Then yeah, sure. I'll volunteer. 
Jennings looks at her. Nods. She is theirs now... 
CUT TO: 
INT. TINY HOUSE -- NOGALES, MEXICO -- DAY. 
Morning sun hits closed eyes. Dark, fat face. Beads of sweat on his brow and cheeks. Thick mustache. His name is SILVIO. 
A SHADOW falls over him. He feels it. Eyes pop open, tense. 
BOY'S VOICE Papa? 
A smile crosses Silvio's face. 
BOY'S VOICE (CONT'D) Despirtate. 
SILVIO No. 
Silvio closes his eyes. The little boy taps him on the chest. 
BOY'S VOICE Si. 
Silvio's smile grows. It is a game. 
SILVIO No. 
We see the boy now. He is eight. Bright brown eyes. His name is ELISEO. 
SILVIO (CONT'D) SI!! Tengo un juego de futbol! 
Silvio acts surprised. 
SILVIO (CONT'D) Nooooo... 
The boy laughs and grabs his father's hand, tugging. 
ELISEO Si Papa! Tenemos que ir! 
The boy pulls with all his might. Silvio makes a show of resisting, then climbs out of bed. Eliseo keeps a tight hold of his hand, and walks him down a hall to a small kitchen with adobe walls and a dirt floor. An opening leads to a small patio that now serves mostly as a chicken coop. Two chickens are in the kitchen. 
A woman stands over a stove, cooking. 
ELISEO (CONT'D) Papa necessita cafe y juevos! Tenemos priso mama! 
She turns and smiles at her son, the bright star in her black life. Her eyes pass over Silvio. She stopped loving him years ago, but he adores their little boy... At least they have that. 
He sits down. She scoops eggs onto a plate with tortillas, drops it in front of him. Hands him a coffee. He sniffs it, hands it back. Without a word she pours in two fingers of tequila. 
The boy stares at his father with endless joy. No idea how unlucky he is. 
Silvio stares back, winks. The boy smiles. 
EXT. SILVIO'S HOUSE -- DAY. 
Silvio and Eliseo exit the house. Silvio wears a State Police uniform, dressed to intimidate. The boy wears his uniform, dressed to play soccer. They walk past cinder-block houses, one after the other, cracked and faded from the sun. 
Tejano music, car horns, and distant yelling penetrate the morning. 
Two ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIERS drive past. 
Silvio and Eliseo wander away, Eliseo's tiny hand clinging to Silvio's police belt. Eliseo has his father for the whole day and he isn't letting go. 
ALEJANDRO If you are very lucky you never will. 
The man walks away, turning back occasionally to see if he is truly free. 
Alejandro turns in another direction, spots THREE US MARINE HUMVEES, EIGHT MARINES BESIDE THEM. Matt stands in front. They walk toward each other. 
ALEJANDRO (CONT'D) It is the Colonel. 
MATT We'll get to that... 
Alejandro looks over the Marines. 
ALEJANDRO Why so many? 
MATT Don't want anything to happen to you on the way to the airport. 
ALEJANDRO Where are we going? 
MATT To keep my promise. 
Alejandro's kind, hollow eyes almost show emotion. 
ALEJANDRO What did they do? 
MATT Doesn't matter. It leads to Fausto. And I'm going to turn you loose. 
Alejandro stands for a moment. The tiniest hint of a smile curls his lips. 
ALEJANDRO Thank you. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CHEVY TAHOE -- DAY. 
Reggie drives, Macy riding shotgun. Through the windshield, we see the entrance to LUKE AIR FORCE BASE approaching. 
REGGIE You're back tonight? 
MACY Yeah. I'll call you, let you know what time. 
REGGIE I don't understand why they don't want me there... 
She deflects. 
MACY It's El Paso... Don't think you're missing much. 
REGGIE Well... you keep your eye on that doughy prick in the golf shirt... 
She smiles. 
MACY I'm supposed to worry about you. 
REGGIE This isn't what we do, Kate. 
MACY We do what we need to do. 
EXT. LUKE AIR FORCE BASE -- PHOENIX --   DAY. 
Reggie pulls to the guard post, hands over their ID's. An AIR FORCE MP takes them, compares ID's to a list. 
AIRPORT MP (To Reggie) You're not on here. 
REGGIE I know. What's she supposed to do? 
AIRPORT MP Walk. 
Macy opens the door and steps out. 
MACY I'll call you when we're heading back. 
She walks around the front of the Tahoe and disappears with the MP into the guard house. 
EXT. LUKE AIR FORCE BASE -- PHOENIX -- DAY. 
Macy walks toward the runways, looking around, unsure where to go. 
MATT (O.S.) Kate. 
She turns, sees Matt. 
MACY JESUS!! 
Alejandro looks straight ahead. 
MACY (CONT'D) You okay? 
Doesn't look at her. Sweat rolls down his face. 
ALEJANDRO Yes. 
She keeps looking at him. He turns to her. 
ALEJANDRO (CONT'D) I'm fine. 
We hear the pilot announce their initial descent into El Paso's FORT BLISS. Alejandro leans back in his seat. 
MACY So... This is your specialty. 
ALEJANDRO Hmm? 
MACY He said the cartels in Mexico are your specialty. 
ALEJANDRO Yes. 
MACY Anything I should know? 
ALEJANDRO You are asking how a watch works. For now, only focus on knowing the time. 
Alejandro lays his head back. Closes his eyes. Macy mumbles to herself. 
MACY Okay... Yoda. 
EXT. FORT BLISS AIR STRIP -- EL PASO -- DAY. 
Alejandro, Macy, and Matt walk off the plane, blinded by the desert sun. 
A man in his late 30's, mustache, DEA AGENT STEVE FERSING, waves from inside a BLACK CHEVY TAHOE. They walk over and climb in. 
INT. CHEVY TAHOE -- CONTINUOUS. 
STEVE How you been? 
MATT Good. Trying to get DOD to let me look into this conspiracy to sink Figi. 
Steve chuckles. 
STEVE It's the damn terrorists. They're sinking all the tropical islands. 
MATT I figure a month or two there, I could get it worked out. 
STEVE Hear there's a real drug problem at the Four Seasons there. You need any help looking into it... 
MATT Yeah, I'll keep you posted... who's going over today? 
STEVE Marshals, DEA. Pulled a team for you. 
MATT I get all warm and fuzzy when you say `team'. 
STEVE It's a crack bunch too. Just rotated back from Afghanistan. 
MATT Where's everybody linking up? 
STEVE Army Intelligence Center. 
Macy listens intently, trying to figure out what the hell they're talking about. Alejandro looks out across the border. Alejandro seems different. He is somewhere else. Somewhere bad. 
EXT. ARMY INTELLIGENCE CENTER -- EL PASO -- DAY. 
TWENTY FOOT WALLS surround the center. A GUARD POST in front of an enormous closed gate. 
The Tahoe pulls up... A guard, dressed like he is on mission in Afghanistan, steps forward. 
GUARD ID's all around. Hey Steve. 
Even Steve hands his ID. The guard returns to the guard house with the IDs. Matt turns around and faces Macy. 
MATT Thought you were in the big time in Phoenix... welcome to Baghdad. 
The guard returns with their IDs. 
MACY You're not American? 
ALEJANDRO No. 
She tries to make sense of that. 
MACY Who do you work for now? 
Alejandro smiles. 
ALEJANDRO I go where I'm sent. 
MACY Where were you sent FROM? 
ALEJANDRO Cartagena. 
MACY ... Colombia? 
Alejandro nods. 
Matt emerges from the other room carrying two M4 carbines and a Kevlar vest. Macy sees him and marches to him. 
MATT (Handing her the vest) See if this fits. 
MACY (Pointing toward Alejandro) Is he CIA? Are you? 
MATT Try it on. 
MACY Well? 
MATT He's a DOD advisor, just like me. 
She doesn't budge, holds his gaze. 
MATT (CONT'D) Pay attention to Alejandro -- he says do something, do it. 
She takes that as a `yes'. 
MACY I'm not authorized to -- 
MATT Fine. Stay here. 
She shifts her weight. Hesitates... 
MATT (CONT'D) But you don't want to, do you? 
MACY I just wanna know what I'm getting INTO -- 
MATT You asked to get on this train. Because you KNOW you're not stopping anything in Phoenix. You're just sweeping up the mess. In six months, every house you raid will be rigged with explosives... You want to find the men responsible? This is where we start. 
He walks off. 
After a moment, she follows. 
EXT. CESAR CHAVEZ BORDER HIGHWAY -- EL PASO -- DAY. 
FIVE CHEVY TAHOES, sirens on the dashboard move through El Paso. 
We watch from above as they cut their way through traffic... 
INT. CHEVY TAHOE -- CONT. 
Macy sits in the back beside Alejandro. He holds a rifle between his legs, barrel pointed down. Macy notices his right hand -- his finger rests on the button that rolls down the window. 
MACY So how nervous should I be? 
The DEA Agent riding shotgun turns back to her. 
AGENT Are you kidding? 
He points out the window. 
AGENT (CONT'D) Over there? That's the beast. 
He turns back, facing front. 
She looks out the window to Juarez. It is so close, you could throw a frisbee into it. 
EXT. BORDER HIGHWAY -- CONTINUOUS. 
Macy lets out an endless sigh of relief. We are driving very fast now. 
Macy looks out the windshield, the hills of El Paso loom in the distance. 
ALEJANDRO On the left. 
Two streets over, as buildings whip by, we see a STATE POLICE VEHICLE even with us. 
It disappears as buildings fill our view, then at the next block we see it again. We hear over the radio -- 
VOICE We have a spotter on the left everyone. Keep your eyes out for a strike vehicle. 
The driver speaks into his radio. 
DRIVER Mexico holding a lane for us at the border? 
VOICE That's my understanding. We're trying to confirm... 
As we race to the border, the state police vehicle has DISAPPEARED. 
We come to the loop, the last exit before being fed into the twelve lanes leading only to the border crossing... 
WITH NO WAY OUT. 
At the loop, the Mexican Federal Police vehicles peel off, leaving the convoy alone. At the border, US HOMELAND SECURITY OFFICERS can be seen standing with rifles, making a very public show of force. 
There is no lane cleared for them, and just like that -- they are trapped in traffic. 
VOICE (CONT'D) Everyone stay in this lane. Our agents at the border are going to wave everyone through and get us over as quick as they can. 
The agents at the border aren't even checking passports, just moving cars through in the lane where the convoy is trapped, but there are fifty cars ahead of them... 
Alejandro looks out his window and sees, two lanes over: 
FOUR MEN in an old Buick LeSabre. They are staring straight ahead. All drenched in sweat. 
Alejandro taps Macy, she scoots closer. 
ALEJANDRO You have a service weapon? 
MACY Yes. 
ALEJANDRO Get it out. 
She unholsters her pistol. 
ALEJANDRO (CONT'D) Silver LeSabre. Two lanes over my 
AGENT Yep. 
He takes the radio. 
AGENT (CONT'D) Silver LeSabre, two lanes right, 3 o'clock. 
VOICE One lane over right, 5 o'clock. Burgundy Expedition. 
VOICE2 Three lanes over right, 1 o'clock, green honda civic. 
Macy grips her pistol. 
MACY Okay... okay... 
Then Alejandro spots it. 
ALEJANDRO Gun. Buick LeSabre, 3 o'clock, gun. 
The flash suppressor of an AK 47 is peeking out in the back seat. A sweaty, young gunman holds the rifle between his legs. 
VOICE2 What are the rules here? 
VOICE We must be engaged to engage. 
VOICE2 Can we get out of this vehicle and set a perimeter? 
VOICE Stay in your vehicle. You can do what they do. If they get out you can get out. 
ALEJANDRO (To Macy) watch the door handles. 
The cars are beginning to move in the convoy's lane. Another fifteen seconds and they can leave this hell behind. 
She points at Alejandro. 
He lets her vent. Burning the unused adrenaline. 
MATT Hey. I told you to stay here... 
MACY I'm not qualified for this. I'm good at what I do, but I'm not a soldier. 
MATT Don't sell yourself short. Reason Reggie's home is I know he's not ready for this, but he's gonna have to get ready real quick, because this is the future. Juarez is what happens when they dig in... 
MACY Don't put me in a situation where I have to break the law to stay alive. Don't do that to me. 
Steve walks up to Matt. 
STEVE You wanna get cracking? 
MATT On that note, I think you better stay out here. 
Matt winks and walks in the building, leaving Macy alone in the motor pool. 
INT INTERROGATION ROOM    DAY 
A door opens and we find GUILLERMO, 45, fat, three day stubble, and very unhappy to be here. His hands are cuffed behind his back. A DEA AGENT holds a bottle of water that Guillermo sucks like an infant. 
Matt walks in. 
MATT (CONT'D) Giving him a belly full of water... you devil. 
Matt smiles, the agent smiles back. 
Matt sits in the only other chair in the room. 
MATT (CONT'D) Didn't think we'd get you here, did you? 
GUILLERMO NO HABLO- 
MATT I love it when they don't hablo. Brought an old buddy of yours. Bet you `hablo' to him. 
The door opens and Alejandro walks in, carrying two five gallon jugs of water. It takes Guillermo a minute, then horror washes over his face. 
GUILLERMO El Medellin. 
MATT Alejandro, he remembers you. 
No expression on Alejandro's face. 
The DEA Agent moves to the door. 
DEA AGENT I'm gonna step out. 
He closes the door behind him. The red `record' button on the camera mounted in the corner goes out. We notice a DRAIN IN THE FLOOR. 
Alejandro walks toward Guillermo, stands across from him. Places a foot on his chest. Pushes... Hard... Guillermo sways back, like a chopped tree. He moves through frame in slow motion, falling out of frame. 
EXT. ARMY INTELLIGENCE CENTER -- DUSK. 
Macy leans against a car. Spots a guy with a cigarette. 
MACY Hey. Got another one of those? 
He gives her one. Lights it. She draws in, coughs. 
MACY (CONT'D) Been a while. Thanks. 
DELTA (O.S.) Like fireworks? 
She turns and sees a Delta operator. Holding a pair of BINOLULARS. 
DELTA (CONT'D) Come here. 
She follows him. They walk to the back of the motor pool to a stairway that leads to the roof of the building. He goes up. She hesitates. 
DELTA (CONT'D) Up to you. 
She takes the bait. Climbs up. 
They sit on the edge of the roof, facing Juarez. He begins glassing the area. 
MACY Fireworks is code for something, I assume. 
They climb in. Reggie looks over at Macy staring out the window, resting her heavy head on her fist. He looks back at Matt and Alejandro, both already asleep. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT PROCESSING CENTER -- TUSCON -- NIGHT. 
The team walks from their parked car toward an irate BOB FISKE, 40'S, walking toward them. 
BOB What's the deal, Matt? Why you holding up my transports? 
MATT We'll be quick. 
BOB I have to feed these bastards when we hold em. Know how an internal auditor responds to an eight thousand dollar check to fucking Domino's Pizza? 
MATT You're so dramatic, Bob. This is Kate Macy with the FBI, and her partner `what's his name'... It was her call. 
Doesn't introduce Alejandro and Bob doesn't ask- Kate notices. 
MACY I don't even know what we're doing here. (Pointing to his cigarette) Got another one of those? 
BOB Finish it before we get inside. 
He gives her one, lights her as they walk. The giant, domed warehouse growing closer. The dull murmur of four hundred people talking and sitting and moving and complaining is wafting out like an odor. 
Macy tries to suck the entire cigarette in one drag. Reggie leans into her. 
REGGIE What happened in El Paso? Talk to me. 
MACY We weren't in El Paso. 
REGGIE ... Where were you? 
MACY We were in Mexico. 
Reggie stops. Macy doesn't. She reaches the door and flicks the smoke on the ground. 
INT. IMMIGRATION WAREHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS. 
The illegals have been separated by sex and criminal record. 
Women on the left... The worker bees -- the busboys and landscapers and construction workers -- are in the center, and in the back, lined up against the wall, the felons... 
Three dozen HOMELAND SECURITY AGENTS   stand over them with M4s. 
BOB There you go. I'm starting the buses. When you're done with em, send em out. 
ALEJANDRO All the women can go. 
BOB Coulda told me that on the phone, Matt. 
MATT First I've heard it. 
They head toward the group of felons and the like as the women are moved out to the buses. 
ALEJANDRO Watch these men close. Look for the ones like the men you saw in Juarez. 
Macy looks at him. His kind, sad demeanor seems to settle her. She knows he is offering her something, just doesn't know why. She turns to the men against the wall. They have their hands behind their backs, zip tied. 
ALEJANDRO (CONT'D) Do you see? 
She scans their faces. Many have tattoos, shaved heads. A boy, maybe 18, haircut like a pop star from the 90's. Diamond earrings, stares hard at her. 
MACY Him. 
Alejandro nods. 
ALEJANDRO Yes. Keep looking. 
She studies more faces. The ones that look like American gangsters- they look down, away, no eye contact. But the ones with mustaches no longer in style, hair parted down the middle, the lanky teens with Polo shirts, they stare defiantly. No fear of consequence from American officers. As subtle as the differences are- how they wear their pants, how they lean against the wall... she understands now. 
MACY Yeah. I see it. 
She turns to Alejandro, but he is gone. She turns around and he stands thirty feet back beside Matt, looking over the migrants. 
Macy walks back to them. 
MACY (CONT'D) What are we looking for? 
MATT Two ways to find drug routes. You can play cat and mouse with those clowns, or ask these guys what trails they avoid. 
ALEJANDRO (CONT'D) Certainly, you understand the value of that. 
REGGIE Alright... We're good. Just don't keep us in the dark. 
ALEJANDRO There is only dark, my friend. 
Reggie studies this strange, sad man. Looks at him with something between fear and mistrust. Macy just looks tired and mad. Matt takes them both in. 
MACY What happens when you find him? 
But Alejandro is already walking back to the warehouse. 
MATT It's been a humdinger of a day. Go home. Get some rest. We'll find a ride. See you tomorrow. 
Matt turns and walks back. 
REGGIE I just drove a hundred fucking miles... 
MACY This is a blessing, trust me. I want to stop and get some cigarettes. 
REGGIE Got you smoking again... it was that bad? 
She moves to the car. 
MACY Worse. 
Reggie watches Matt walk back in the warehouse, trying desperately to play catch up. Wondering why no one, his partner included, will tell him anything... 
CUT TO: 
INT. CHEVY TAHOE -- NIGHT. 
Reggie drives down an empty interstate 19. Up ahead, he spots a TRUCK STOP. 
REGGIE Not that I think you should, but if you want cigarettes -- 
He looks over -- she is sound asleep. He drives past the truck stop, tail lights fading into the desert... 
CUT TO: 
INT. MACY'S APARTMENT -- DAY. 
Macy lays in bed watching the blades of her ceiling fan in their endless revolution. She rises -- dressed in pajamas at last -- and heads to the kitchen. 
She pours a cup of coffee, heads to her computer. Pulls up the CNN website, scrolls the news, nothing about a shoot-out on the border. 
Goes to the El Paso newspaper website. Nothing there either. She googles SHOOT OUT, JUAREZ... is bombarded with images. 
Her screen is flooded with photos: women naked, tortured, beaten. Breasts cut off, pinkish flesh exposed. 
Bodies of men in ditches, dead in chairs, dead in cars... dead everywhere. But nothing of yesterday. The images invade her. Can't look anymore... 
She digs up a cigarette, goes to her screen door, opens it and steps out, lights her smoke. 
She sees Reggie pull up and park. She yells down to him. 
MACY What's up? 
REGGIE You're phone's off. 
MACY Yep. 
REGGIE We gotta go. Those spooks been calling me all morning. 
MACY Want some coffee? 
REGGIE We gotta go. 
MACY I have to get dressed. Come up. 
INT MACY'S APARTMENT    DAY 
Reggie leans against the dining room table, cup of coffee in hand. Macy moves from her bathroom, slacks on and only an old, off white bra. He notices. Doesn't hide it. 
REGGIE Gotta get you a new bra, woman. 
MACY List of things I need is almost infinite. 
REGGIE Just saying. You gotta... some nice lacy something. 
MACY Are you getting this? 
REGGIE Yeah. I don't believe it, but I understand what they're saying. 
ALEJANDRO (SUBTITLE) Can you mark the tunnel on here? 
Hands him a pen. 
MIGRANT 1 (SUBTITLE) Sure. It's been a while. Three years. They made me dig for a month to cross. I snuck out one night and ran... They hide the entrance behind an old car. 
MATT Guillermo was telling the truth. 
Alejandro looks at Matt. 
ALEJANDRO This is our way across. Right here.(Back to the migrants) Where do you live? 
MIGRANT 1 (SUBTITLE) East of the airport. 
Matt spoons the last of his slurpee. Turns to Macy. 
MATT How good is your Spanish? 
MACY Not great. 
REGGIE Mine is. How did you get all this? 
Matt smiles, spooning himself slurpee. 
MATT Power of persuasion. 
ALEJANDRO (SUBTITLE) Know a Wells Fargo on Baseline? 
MIGRANT 1 (SUBTITLE) No cabron. We drive to Cave Creek for the bank. There is a Wells Fargo on Baseline, but it is a narco bank. The narcos hit you as you walk to it... Only the Salvadorans use it, cuz they don't know... the soldiers deposit narco money there. They will rob you cabron, to make up for what they skimmed. No, you have to bank up by the white cowboys, that is safest. 
ALEJANDRO (Looks at Matt) Guillermo told the truth about everything. 
MATT We're gonna have a good day.(Points to the migrants) Let's send these guys home. 
MACY Border patrol's not down there. 
MATT Think they'd tell us all this and then go back to Mexico? You get one night's sleep and forget everything? 
ALEJANDRO (SUBTITLE) Thank you ... don't cross again. Not for a long time. 
The migrant looks down at a small card in his hand. The others have them as well. 
MIGRANT 1 (SUBTITLE) These green cards are good? 
ALEJANDRO (SUBTITLE) Better than good, my friend. 
The men get up casually and walk out, sipping their soft drinks. Matt looks at Macy. 
MATT Have friends at Phoenix SWAT? 
MACY Yeah, we use them for breeches when HRT is busy. 
MATT They any good? 
MACY Yeah... they get a lot of practice. 
He nods. 
MATT Got a new frame of reference for practice now, don't you. Let's give Phoenix SWAT a call, shall we? 
MACY (To Alejandro) What did you find out? 
He lays a hand on her shoulder. The intimacy of the gesture surprises her. 
ALEJANDRO We are close. 
CUT TO: 
WE ARE LOOKING THROUGH A TELEPHOTO LENS. 
We watch a MAN, 20'S, BAGGY JEANS, WHITE T-SHIRT, sitting on the curb, fiddling with an IPhone. 
VOICE We taking him when he makes the grab? 
MATT (O.S.) When he comes out of the bank. We need the deposit receipt to seize the account. Let him do the assault... we hit him when he comes out. 
MACY What? 
MAN IN SUIT Know what this is? 
He shows her a printout. 
MACY No. 
MAN IN SUIT It's a bank line of credit. You make payments over what you owe and it doesn't show as cash it shows as a negative loan balance... See that? 
He points to the loan amount. 
MACY Oh my god. 
Macy walks out of the bank and straight to the van, Reggie right behind. 
She looks bewildered and scared. She climbs in next to them. 
MACY (CONT'D) They just seized seventeen million dollars... I need that explained to me. Guillermo Diaz told you all that in an HOUR? 
MATT We knew where his accounts were, we just didn't know they were shaking people down in front of the fucking branch. It's a bogus bust, though. Can't prosecute it. No one controls who deposits money in an account. An attorney will have that money back in a few months... but a lot of heads will roll before then... 
MACY We can arrest Manuel for now. At least get him off the street. 
Heads off. 
MATT Don't you dare. 
She turns back to them. 
ALEJANDRO We need him to get called back to Mexico. That's the objective, Kate. 
MACY That makes NO sense... We can get him off the street! RIGHT NOW. If I can tie any of these payments to-- 
MATT You can't arrest him. 
Beat. 
MACY Watch me. 
She marches back toward the bank. 
CUT TO: 
INT. FEDERAL BUILDING -- DIRECTOR JENNING'S OFFICE -- DAY. 
Macy and Reggie sit across from Jennings and Phil. Bob Fiske is there as well. 
JENNINGS US Attorney won't issue the warrant. I can't override-- 
MACY This is ridiculous. His guys are robbing people IN FRONT OF THE BANK... So we find out where his boss lives in Mexico. Big deal. I've seen the Mexican police in action and believe me -- 
JENNINGS Kate... what do you want? What would you like done here? 
MACY I would like to follow some semblance of procedure, and build a prosecutable case against -- 
JENNINGS We prosecuted more felony drug cases in this region last year than in the two previous years combined. Are you feeling that on the street? You getting the `vibe' that we"re winning? 
Beat. 
MACY No. 
JENNINGS Do you? 
REGGIE No... I don't. 
PHIL Advisors like Matt come in, stir the pot, cause these criminals to react and make mistakes. That's how we build cases against the individuals that actually make a difference in this fight. When they're nervous, when they stop trusting their crews, when they move their money... these are all opportunities to strike... that's the purpose of contractors like Matt. 
JENNINGS This isn't something I dreamed up myself, Kate. I don't have the authority to hire advisors or authorize joint agency missions. Or fly agents from air force bases, are you understanding me? These decisions are made far from here. By officials elected to office, not appointed to them... so if your fear is operating out of bounds I am telling you, you're not. The boundary has been moved. Got it? 
She does. But that doesn't mean she likes it... 
CUT TO: 
INT MACY'S VEHICLE   LATE AFTERNOON 
Macy and Reggie drive in silence. Nowhere in particular... Just driving. 
MACY Where'd that guy say the safe banks were, Cave Creek? 
Reggie goes to her and hugs her as CAVE CREEK POLICE VEHICLES pull into the parking lot, sirens blazing. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. BUFFALO CHIP -- NIGHT. 
EVERYONE IS HERE NOW. FBI. All of them. Ted is loaded into a car. 
Macy rests against a SQUAD CAR, smoking a cigarette, too exhausted to care that she looks like she just got fucked outside a bar. 
Director Jennings walks up, leans against the car beside her. 
JENNINGS See what I mean? They try to react and make mistakes... you want a LITTLE -- 
MACY No. 
JENNINGS Then keep shaking the tree. Let's see what else falls. 
Jennings stands. 
JENNINGS (CONT'D) Finding that photo and luring him out. That was smart. 
His knowing smile says: our little secret. 
She nods in appreciation. 
MACY Thank you, Dave. 
JENNINGS Thank you. Unlike most of the perps we see, Phoenix PD officers facing thirty years in prison have plenty to lose. We'll know whatever he knows very soon. 
Jennings walks off. Macy pulls a long drag from the cigarette. She looks at it, and must accept the fact that she is once again a smoker... 
Reggie walks up to her. He hands her a new pack. They look at each other. Try not to, but can't help it. They laugh... But when Macy's laughter risks turning to tears, she stops. 
REGGIE Thought all you white girls shaved. 
She starts laughing again. 
MACY You saved my life. 
REGGIE Nah. Think he was meant to scare you, or test you, maybe... 
MACY Are they following us? 
REGGIE Don't know. They're gonna take your vehicle, look for a transmitter. Which would mean there's someone in our house involved too. (MORE) 
REGGIE (CONT'D) Maybe someone tailed us from the bank... I don't know. 
The not knowing scares her. 
MACY Thank you. I mean it. 
He accepts it with a nod. 
MACY (CONT'D) Where is he now? 
REGGIE Backseat of your car. With our shadows. 
Takes that in. 
MACY I hope they kill him. 
REGGIE You don't mean that. 
MACY ... No. 
They lean against the car in silence. 
INT. MACY'S VEHICLE -- CONT. 
Ted sits in the backseat, face destroyed. The reality of his situation now fully in front of him. Matt sits in the front seat, Alejandro beside him. 
TED Okay. Okay. Okay... 
MATT You said that Ted. 
TED Look... I. I. I was asked what her CASE INVOLVED- 
As quick as a cat, Alejandro stabs his thumb into Ted's eye. Ted pitches forward. 
He steps away. 
ALEJANDRO (CONT'D) Get some rest tonight. Tomorrow they will call Manuel back, and we will cut a leg from them. 
He walks back toward Matt, leaving Macy staring out across the desert. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SILVIO'S HOUSE -- BEDROOM -- DAY. 
Silvio sleeps. A shadow crosses his face. He opens an eye. Eliseo stands there holding coffee and a plate of eggs and tortillas. 
SILVIO Juevos? 
ELISEO Si papa. 
SILVIO Con jalapenos? 
ELISEO Si. 
Silvio sits up. Takes the coffee, drinks. No booze in it. Thinks about sending it back, but the look on Eliseo's face makes him reconsider. He'll get drunk soon enough. He takes the plate and feeds. 
Eliseo sits on the bed. 
ELISEO (CONT'D) Trabajando hoy? 
SILVIO En la noche. 
ELISEO Quere jugar baseball? En el parque? 
The man chews. Thinks. Exaggerates his expressions. 
SILVIO Hmmmm ... baseball. 
The boy laughs. 
ELISEO BASEBALL!!! Si. 
SILVIO Okay. 
The boy shoots off like a rocket. Silvio laughs. As he eats, we see the AK 47 by the bed. A bag of coke and a thousand or so dollars on the night stand. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. BEST WESTERN -- SCOTTSDALE -- DAY. 
Macy and Reggie pull in and park next to five US GOVERNMENT SUBURBANS. They get out and walk past them. 
They get to the room and knock. 
INT. BEST WESTERN SUITE -- CONT. 
Matt lets them in. He wears desert camo fatigues, as do most of the people in the room. There are computers linked to monitors. One displays footage of MANUEL DIAZ'S HOUSE and OFFICE. Another is footage of the DESERT. But that footage is MOVING. 
MATT We may have the tunnel, right here. 
We look at the footage. Cactus and desert grass in the foreground. In the background, a ravine. 
MATT (CONT'D) We'll know soon enough. 
EXT. DESERT -- CONTINUOUS. 
We look at cactus and brush along a ridge. Slowly, caterpillar slow, the brush begins moving. We can just make out an enormous telephoto lens wrapped in camouflage tape. 
INT. BEST WESTERN SUITE -- CONT. 
Matt points to coolers filled with Gatorade and Red Bull. 
MATT (CONT'D) Tasty beverage? 
This guy ... 
MACY What's the plan? 
MATT (Easy smile) Going hunting. 
There is a DOD AGENT wearing headphones and sitting in front of what looks like a sound board linked to a computer. 
From the other room, DELTA and one of his team members walk through. Moving toward the TOPO MAP on the wall. 
Silvio sits in his little courtyard, watching the chickens. He tosses a handful of feed and they scamper after it. He drinks a beer. Three empties beside him. He looks at his watch. It's time. He gets up. 
EXT. STASH HOUSE -- NOGALES -- DAY. 
Three state Police Vehicles. One being loaded full of bricks of marijuana. Silvio stands beside the car, smoking. 
INT. US GOVERNMENT SUBURBAN -- DAY. 
Matt sits in the front seat. A Delta operator driving. Macy, Reggie, Alejandro and three Delta operators sit in the back. 
Matt is on his cell. 
MATT What. What. What's he saying? 
VOICE Um. Hold on... They called him back. He's on the road now. 
MATT Where. 
VOICE Turning left on Scottsdale. You got about three hours and he'll be across. 
Matt turns back to the Delta operators. 
MATT We're gonna have to hit the tunnel the minute we get on the ground. 
Matt looks at Macy and Reggie. 
MATT (CONT'D) Pretty exciting, huh? 
They don't share his enthusiasm. They just want this to be over. 
INT. RANGE ROVER -- DAY. 
Manuel is sweating, even though the AC blasts in his face. On the seat beside him is an overnight bag. 
EXT. INTERSTATE 10 -- PHOENIX -- DAY. 
We watch Manuel's Range Rover get on the interstate. 
VOICE He's on I 10, travelling southeast... 
EXT. MEXICAN ROAD -- LATE AFTERNOON. 
A MEXICAN STATE POLICE VEHICLE ambleS down the road, heading toward the tunnel... 
INT. POLICE VEHICLE -- MEXICAN ROAD -- CONTINUOUS. 
Silvio drives, marijuana bundles fill the backseat. He smokes a cigarette, he slows down, pulls off the pavement. 
EXT. MEXICAN ROAD -- CONTINUOUS. 
We watch from a distance as Silvio's vehicle bounces down a dirt road, disappearing into the desert as the sun hides behind the horizon. 
INT. US GOVERNMENT SUBURBAN -- NIGHT. 
We pull off the highway and stop. A man in a ghillie suit stands up, walks toward them carrying a camera with an 800mm lens. Matt turns toward us. 
MATT On foot from here. 
EXT. TRANSPORT VEHICLE -- CONT. 
Macy steps out and sees another vehicle parked. Another half dozen men in full camo. From the back of the Suburban, six duffel bags are opened. Operators reach in and grab weapons, magazines, grenades. Generation 4 night vision goggles are passed to everyone. DELTA walks up to Reggie and Macy. 
DELTA Keep your fucking safeties on and the barrels pointed down. Stay in the back and don't shoot anyone on my fucking team, got it? 
Doesn't wait for a reply. 
REGGIE We HAVE done this before. 
MACY I don't think we've done THIS. 
They move out. We watch the world through NIGHT VISION GOGGLES. 
We run a bit then kneel down. We are flagged forward. Kneel down. We leap frog this way forever. 
Macy looks out over the desert. TWO COYOTES(the animals), are stopped, staring right at us. Macy makes eye contact. They begin trotting off, never breaking eye contact with Macy, as though they are begging her to follow. While she still can... 
We come to a rise. Everyone lays down. DELTA whispers to Alejandro. 
DELTA Rules of engagement on this deal? 
They hear more gunfire. Screw it. Silvio's not waiting around any longer. He gets in the driver's seat. 
BANDIT Traiga me contigo!!! 
SILVIO No cabron! 
The man opens the passenger door as Silvio starts the squad car. A bullet penetrates the bandit's face, just under the eye. He drops as if he's been unplugged. 
Silvio ducks down, throwing the car in reverse, but a hand reaches in the window, and turns the car off. Silvio looks up and sees -- 
Alejandro. 
HE pulls Silvio from the car. Spins him around. Pulls the pistol from Silvio's belt. Tosses it on the ground. 
Silvio stares at Alejandro in absolute terror. 
SILVIO (CONT'D) El Medellin. 
Alejandro places his pistol to Silvio's face. 
SILVIO (CONT'D) No me mata!! 
Alejandro jams his thumb in Silvio's larynx. Silvio gasps for air. Alejandro grabs his hair, pistol to his head. 
ALEJANDRO (SUBTITLE) What you do now is for your family. Whether they see tomorrow rests with you. 
Tears roll down Silvio's cheek. 
ALEJANDRO (CONT'D) You will drive me. 
MACY (O.S.) WHAT ARE YOU DOING?? 
Alejandro turns and sees Macy, her rifle trained on him. 
ALEJANDRO Put that down. 
MACY STEP AWAY. I mean it. Move away from him. 
He looks at her. 
The automatic fire from different tunnel shafts rushes in and out like blasts of hot air. 
ALEJANDRO We are in Mexico now. You have no jurisdiction. 
MACY We can't be here-- 
Alejandro raises his pistol and fires six rounds into Macy's chest. 
She collapses to the ground, sucking for air. Alejandro walks over and grabs her rifle. Tosses it in the back of the Police car. 
ALEJANDRO Don't ever point a weapon at me again. Get your breath and go back to the surface. 
She gasps, clasping at the Kevlar vest that saved her life. She rolls onto her stomach and struggles to stand. Reaches for her pistol. Alejandro slams her face into his knee. Tosses her pistol across the room. 
ALEJANDRO (CONT'D) Stop it Kate. Just stop. This is what we were sent here to do. 
He pulls her to her feet. Points his pistol at her. 
ALEJANDRO (CONT'D) I don't have time. Go to the surface. Now. 
Blood pours from her shattered nose. She has lost and she knows it. 
MACY You lured Manuel to Mexico so you could kill him. This is your cab driver. 
ALEJANDRO I am here to kill the man with the power to summon Manuel Diaz. I am here for Fausto. But I will kill Manuel too. It's what I do, Kate. Go. Or I will do it to you. 
She stumbles back, turns around and runs. 
ALEJANDRO (CONT'D) (Turning the gun on Sylvio) Get in. 
Alejandro gets in the back seat of the police car. 
ALEJANDRO (CONT'D) Drive back to Mexico. 
The car backs up, spins and drives the tunnel road until we ARE: 
EXT. MEXICAN ROAD -- NIGHT. 
We are in the backseat, looking through the windshield. 
MACY I'll manage. 
She walks out of the tunnel toward Reggie. DELTA removes his boot and walks away. 
MACY (CONT'D) Let's go. 
Helicopters can be heard. In the distance, sirens are approaching. 
Macy and Reggie walk away from the scene. 
REGGIE What just happened? 
MACY They woke me up. Showed me the whole thing. 
REGGIE And? 
MACY And I quit. 
They continue to walk, sirens racing toward them. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SILVIO'S SQUAD CAR NIGHT 
Far ahead, we see TAIL LIGHTS. Silvio's labored breathing gives rhythm to the racing vehicle. Alejandro stays low in the back seat. 
ALEJANDRO (Into mouthpiece) This is the target ahead? Confirm. 
VOICE Copy. Black Range Rover, 60 meters ahead. 
ALEJANDRO Put on your lights. Pull the car over. 
He flips on his siren. 
INT. MANUEL'S RANGE ROVER -- CONT. 
He sees the siren. 
MANUEL What the fuck. Want to bribe me, eh. 
He reaches for his pistol, puts it in his lap. 
INT. SILVIO'S SQUAD CAR -- CONT. 
The range Rover pulls over. Us right behind it. Silvio is breathing even heavier, if that's possible. So many ways this can go wrong... 
ALEJANDRO Use the speaker. Tell him to get out of the car. 
Silvio grabs the radio handset, flips the switch, and his voice comes through the speaker on the roof of the car. 
SILVIO Afuera del carro!! 
INT. RANGE ROVER -- CONT. 
MANUEL This mother fucker... 
He sticks the pistol in his waistband. Opens the car door. Steps out. 
INT. SILVIO'S SQUAD CAR -- CONT. 
We watch Manuel through the windshield. He is standing in the road. 
ALEJANDRO Tell him to raise his shirt and turn around. 
SILVIO Levanta su camisa. 
MANUEL You know who I am? HUH?? 
ALEJANDRO Tell him to do it or you will shoot him where he stands. 
SILVIO Voy a matarse cabron. Levanta tu camisa. 
Manuel does it. We see the pistol. 
SILVIO (CONT'D) Tira la pistola en la tierra. 
Manuel throws his pistol in the dirt. 
ALEJANDRO Look how good you are at pretending to be a police officer. Out of the car. Now.

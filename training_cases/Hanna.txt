HANNA 
Written by 
Seth Lochead 
1 EXT. FOREST FLOOR - DAY. 1 
Winter. Silence on the forest floor. Snow falling. Then the sound of breathing. The soft footfall of a person running. HANNA, fourteen years old, long hair, eyes like blue ice, glides through the trees, a bow strapped to her shoulder. She is dressed in animal skins and fur shoes. She blends almost completely into the landscape of trees and snow. She stops dead. Her breath visible in the freezing air. Suddenly alert, she has spotted her prey. A REINDEER nuzzling the snow, trying to unearth a patch of grass to eat. Its head pops up - danger. Too late. The sudden swoosh and the snap of an arrow piercing its skin. The deer flops to the ground with a thud. It whines, its feet dig at the earth. Its mouth gnaws at the icy air. Steam pouring from its nostrils. HANNA approaches, removes a fur glove. She bends to her knees. She reaches out and gently pets the animals frightened face. She runs her hand down along its neck, in towards the wound. 
HANNA I just missed your heart. She stands and pulls out an old pistol from her waist holster. She fires two shots directly at CAMERA. 
CUT TO TITLE: HANNA 
2 EXT. FOREST FLOOR - LATER. 2 
A knife enters the deer near its anus. 
HANNA 
(WHISPER) Remove the penis and scrotum, make a deep, circular cut around the rectum. HANNA pulls the knife up towards the brisket. 
HANNA (CONT'D) 
(WHISPER) Cut from the rear to the brisket. She works calmly without expression. 
3 EXT. FOREST FLOOR - LATER 3 
The deer lies on it's side. HANNA breaths hard. She reaches deep into the body cavity and pulls out intestine, stomach, liver. She freezes, sensing danger. Her hand deep inside the animal. She listens. She looks out into the still forest. No sound. ERIK, mid forties, a mammoth with leathery face, stands behind her like a ghost. 
ERIK You're dead. Right now. I've killed you. HANNA spins spraying deer-blood on to the snow and brings her fist right to ERIK's face. He blocks and thumps an open palm on to HANNA's shoulder sending her sprawling into the snow. She leaps to her feet, as ERIK aims a kick at her head. She dodges, punches below his knee cap, and goes for her pistol. ERIK slaps the hand away. 
ERIK (CONT'D) Use your hands! She goes for the gun again and again he stops her. He moves in tight, pulling the gun from its holster and tossing it deep into the forest. HANNA clips ERIK'S temple sending him to the ground. She wraps her arms around his neck preparing to snap... ... but she can't. He throws her over his shoulder into a pile of snow. ERIK stands and wipes the snow from his pants. His face shows a touch of frustration. He plods into the forest. 
ERIK (CONT'D) Drag it back yourself. HANNA drags herself to the deer's side. She stares at its dead face. 
4 EXT. FOREST FLOOR - LATER 4 
HANNA clears the kill site. Wipes the last dots of blood on to a stick. No sign she was ever there. 
5 EXT. FOREST FLOOR - EVENING 5 
HANNA drags the 200 lb deer on a makeshift sled. She lifts her knees high and moves at a steady pace. Hidden among the trees, a little way off, ERIK is watching her. 
6 EXT. LOG CABIN. NORTH SWEDISH FOREST - EVENING 6 
A log cabin built around an ancient tree surrounded by the thick forest. HANNA is standing in the snow, stripping the deer with a knife. It's a tough job but she does it no fuss. 
7 INT. LOG CABIN - EVENING 7 
Almost everything ERIK and HANNA own they've made themselves using what can be found in the forest. What few possessions that have been brought in from the outside world are old and worn. HANNA is making a fire using a bow drill. The friction of the drill produces an ember which HANNA carefully transfers to some dried leaves. 
8 INT. LOG CABIN - LATER 8 
HANNA and ERIK sit either side of a small fire, still dressed in furs. HANNA swirls a spoon around in a dish of stew. ERIK takes a mouthful, watches HANNA not eating. 
ERIK What's wrong? Are you hurt? She keeps swirling her spoon. 
ERIK (CONT'D) You were half asleep. 
HANNA I'll do better next time. 
ERIK German. 
ERIK It's difficult to explain. 
HANNA Try. He opens the encyclopedia again, leafs through the pages and reads. 
ERIK 
(READING) âMusic. A combination of sounds with a view to beauty of form and expression of emotion'. 
HANNA But how does it feel? Erik is not equipped to answer such esoteric questions. 
ERIK Good. It feels good. It's, uh, nice. 
HANNA Tell me properly. Can you play music? 
ERIK Your mother could. She used to sing very well. 
HANNA I'd like to hear it for myself. 
ERIK You will soon enough. 
HANNA How soon? Erik looks away from her questioning eyes. 
ERIK When you're ready. 
HANNA I'm ready. I'm ready already. They look at each other- he weighs it up. 
ERIK Just go to sleep now. I'll see you in the morning. 
Hanna covers herself in an animal skin as ERIK pulls a wattle screen across her bed, strokes her hair gently for a moment and leaves the room. HANNA reaches under her bed and takes out an old battered photograph, taken 15 years ago, of a YOUNG WOMAN with eyes like hers - her MOTHER, JOANNA ZADEK. 
10 EXT. LOG CABIN - MORNING 10 
The morning sunlight slants through the forest. ERIK is walking through the trees. He stops, raises his pistol at a tree trunk some distance away and fires. The tree breaks apart. 
11 INT. HANNA'S ROOM. LOG CABIN - MORNING 11 
HANNA wakes with the sound of the GUNSHOT. She is still holding her mothers photgraph. HANNA pushes the photograph under her mattress and climbs out of bed. 
12 EXT. LOG CABIN. SHOOTING RANGE - MORNING 12 
Another GUNSHOT breaks a tree apart. Hanna fires. Another tree breaks apart. She rolls and fires. She rolls and fires. She reloads. And fires. ERIK watching. 
13 EXT. LOG CABIN - DAY 13 
HANNA attacks ERIK. Hand. Knee. Elbow. Fist. He defends easily. 
ERIK Again. They reset. She repeats the motion. Hand. Knee. Elbow. Fist. 
ERIK (CONT'D) Again. Hand. Knee. Elbow. Fist. She's getting faster. Her strikes are solid. 
14 EXT. LOG CABIN - DAY 14 
A medium size log nailed along two pillars of the cabin acts as a chin-up bar. Erik and Hanna do chin-ups. Both are fit. Neither will give up. ERIK observing HANNA's power. Both have the sense that he is judging her. HANNA's face fiercely determined. 
15 EXT. LOG CABIN - DAY 15 
ERIK and HANNA sit with their backs to a tree in the huge forest as they breathlessly recover from the exhaustion of the exercise. HANNA speaks fast, reciting. 
HANNA I live in Leipzig. German city. Population 0.7 Million people. We live at Number 7 Weissingerplatz. I go to school at the Klaus Kohle Gymnasium and my best friends are Rudi Gunter and Clara Schliess. I like literature and sport, in particular tennis and athletics. I have a dog called Trudi. 
16 EXT. NORTH SWEDISH FOREST - DAY 16 
HANNA is running, racing ERIK. Fierce determination, almost anger in her eyes. They reach the river and dive in. 
ERIK It tells Marissa Wiegler where we are. He looks at her, a hint of a challenge. 
ERIK (CONT'D) When you want to leave here all you have to do is flip that switch. She approaches the box and places a single finger on the small red switch. 
ERIK (CONT'D) But once it's done, there'll be no going back. She'll never give up until you're dead, or she is. You understand? I wont be there to hold your hand. So be sure. Be sure it's what you really want. 
HANNA You're not scaring me. He looks at her disbelievingly. She shakes her head in protest, but simultaneously moves away from the switch. He softens towards her. 
ERIK It's here. There's no rush. Take your time. HANNA turns her back on the box, but can't help taking another look at it over her shoulder. 
26 INT. CABIN. HANNA'S ROOM - NIGHT 26 
HANNA is under the covers again while ERIK reads more from the encyclopedia. 
ERIK Laika, a mongrel dog from the streets of Moscow, was the first animal to orbit the Earth. She was launched into outer space on the third of November, 1957. Scientists believed humans would be unable to survive conditions of outer space, so flights by animals were viewed as an experimental precursor to human missions. Her rocket was not designed to be retrievable, and Laika had always been intended to die. 
HANNA That's sad. ERIK awkwardly turns the page to change subject. 
ERIK When a star collapses the supernova explosion is 10 billion times brighter than other stars. HANNA shuts her eyes and tries to imagine how bright that might be. 
27 INT. LOG CABIN - MORNING 27 
ERIK straps the bow to his chest and grabs a quiver of bolts. 
ERIK Will you hunt with me? Hanna is sweeping the ground. 
HANNA If you want. 
ERIK It's up to you. 
HANNA Me? 
ERIK Yes. HANNA eyes the box sitting open, it's waiting for her. 
HANNA I'll stay. 
ERIK Fine. ERIK leaves abruptly. HANNA continues to sweep the ground, her movements bring her closer to the metal box. She stops sweeping and looks at the box. She turns and walks out of the cabin. 
28 EXT. LOG CABIN - CONTINUOUS 28 
HANNA comes out of the cabin and sits down on a tree trunk. She sees the snow fox cub but says nothing. It comes over and noses around the cabin, but HANNA'S mind is elsewhere. 
HANNA (whispering to herself) Marissa Wiegler. 
29 INT. LOG CABIN - CONTINUOUS 29 
CLOSE ON - the metal box, the switch catches the light from the door as HANNA enters to confront it. The room is still and quiet. HANNA approaches the metal box and slowly reaches out her hand. 
HANNA 
(WHISPER) Come and find me. CLOSE ON - She flips the switch, a little red light begins to flash. An ALARM CLOCK begins to ring as we cut to - 
30 INT. MARISSA'S APARTMENT. VIRGINIA. USA - EARLY MORNING 30 
CLOSE ON - a bedside alarm clock ringing loudly. MARISSA WIEGLER, a handsome woman in her mid-40's with red hair, reaches over and slams the alarm clock off. She's alone in her bed. She always is. She has no children. She's made choices in her life and lives without looking back. She walks into her ensuite bathroom and looks at herself in the mirror. She collects her toothbrush and bares her teeth in a snarl as she brushes them. Her gums bleed a little. 
31 INT. LOG CABIN - EVENING 31 
HANNA tends to boiling pots. She's cooking a feast. ERIK enters. He stamps his feet shedding ice at the door. He walks by the box and sees the little red light flickering on. HANNA sees this and sees him smile, but she knows he's sad. 
ERIK You were lucky to grab that deer. There was nothing out there today. ERIK looks over at the meal HANNA is preparing. 
ERIK (CONT'D) Smells good. He wraps an arm around her shoulder. They don't hug much and it shows. HANNA is almost defensive and tense. And then the hug is over. 
BOB He's right. This has nothing to do with us. I don't understand. 
MARISSA You don't have to. I'm making the call. BOB and WALT exchange a look. 
MARISSA (CONT'D) Thank you, Gentlemen. That'll be all. The video screen flickers off, people take their files and start to leave. MARISSA WIEGLER stands in the darkness. 
35 INT. HANNA'S ROOM. LOG CABIN - CONTINUOUS 35 
HANNA sits in her bed reading her encyclopaedia. ERIK, dressed incongruously in the suit and tie, enters and sits on the edge of her bed. She doesn't look up from her book. His face shows more emotion than we've seen before. 
ERIK Hanna... HANNA looks up, still trying to hide her fear. 
ERIK (CONT'D) Tell me again? 
HANNA Marissa Weigler. 
ERIK Then? 
HANNA Postcard. 
ERIK Then? 
HANNA What? 
ERIK The address where we meet. 
HANNA Wilhelm Grimm's house. Stephanstrasse 260. 10559, Berlin. Germany. ERIK moves a strand of hair from HANNA'S forehead and looks at her with paternal care. 
ERIK Good night my sweet girl. He stands and quietly goes to the door when her voice stops him. 
HANNA Father... He turns to look at her, both their eyes full of trepidation. 
ERIK You can do this. You're ready. Just remember what I've taught you. She smiles reassuringly at him. 
HANNA I'll see you there. 
36 EXT. LOG CABIN. NORTH SWEDISH FOREST - NIGHT. 36 
ERIK comes out of the cabin carrying a small rucksack. He closes the door behind him and takes a deep breath. 
37 INT/EXT. HANNA'S ROOM. LOG CABIN - CONTINUOUS 37 
HANNA gets out of bed and goes to the small window. 
She watches as ERIK walks away from the cabin for the last time. 
38 EXT. EDGE OF NORTH SWEDISH FOREST. NIGHT. 38 
Dusk in the forest as the flickering sun goes down. As peaceful a place as you could imagine. A calm blueness of impending night on the snow. Then a series of ropes break the top frame and FIFTY US SPECIAL FORCES dressed in white snow gear silently abseil down to the ground. 
39 INT. HANNA'S ROOM. LOG CABIN - NIGHT 39 
HANNA is doing push-ups on her bedroom floor. 
40 EXT. FOREST/CABIN - NIGHT 40 
Infra-red POV as the SPECIAL OPS TEAM head through the forest wearing night vision-goggles. The Leader of the Operation follows the tracker signal. 
SPECIAL OPS Is this guy one of ours? 
HEAD OF OPS Used to be. Tread carefully, he's been in there a long time, he's damaged goods, and he knows we're coming. We see through the infra-red vision the endless trees in the pitch blackness. The SPECIAL OPS FORCES get closer. They see the cabin in the night. They approach. Silence in the darkness. Just the breathing of men in the icy cold. 
41 INT. HANNA'S ROOM. LOG CABIN - NIGHT 41 
BURTON This must all be very strange for you. You've been in the forest a long time. But I want you to know no one's going to hurt you. We just want to talk to you about your father. HANNA seems to be staring up at the ceiling. 
BURTON (CONT'D) Hanna? He follows her eye-line to the CCTV camera above them. 
HANNA Is that a camera? 
BURTON Ah, yes, that's a camera. To keep a record. 
HANNA Camera obscura, it's Latin for "dark chamber". 
47 INT. CAMP G. OBSERVATION ROOM. 47 
LEWIS sits with the MONITOR, watching HANNA watching him. 
LEWIS Plug the CCTV through to Langley. Extension 247. MONITOR presses some buttons as LEWIS calls on his phone and speaks into it. 
LEWIS (CONT'D) You should have visual on the psych evaluation now. 
48 INT. OBS ROOM. LANGLEY HQ. NIGHT. CONT. 48 
MARISSA, alone in a Langley OBS ROOM. No one else there. Late at night in America. Something secret about Marissa here. On the screen she sees HANNA in the Interrogation Room. Her screen tells she is watching CAMP G - Interrogation Room 3. MARISSA watches HANNA intently. 
HANNA It was first described by the Arabic scientist Ibn Alhazen in the year 1021. 
MARISSA What's she saying? 
LEWIS (O.S.) Gobbledygook. 
49 INT. OBS ROOM. LANGLEY HQ. NIGHT. CONT. 49 
MARISSA stares at her screen, at the blank face of the fourteen year old HANNA. Focus in on MARISSA's face as she studies this strange young woman. The sense that MARISSA knows more about this girl than she is letting on. On the screen BURTON continues to probe. 
BURTON Can I get you something? What do you like? Music? Magazines? Just say. Anything at all. 
50 INT. HANNA'S HOLDING CELL - CONTINUOUS 50 
HANNA leans forward. Looks at BURTON, who encourages her with his eyes. She whispers. 
HANNA I want to speak to Marissa Wiegler. 
51 INT. OBS ROOM. LANGLEY - CONTINUOUS 51 
MARISSA sits in stunned silence. 
LEWIS (O.S.) Did you hear that? MARISSA pauses before she answers. 
MARISSA Tell her I'll be there tonight. 
LEWIS But... 
MARISSA Just do it. 
52 INT. CAMP G. MILITARY LABORATORY. 52 
A white space with specialist lighting and the hum of specialised air pressurizes. A protected environment - this is the DNA lab. A MILITARY DOCTOR is looking at the result of something on a computer. It has shocked and intrigued him. He calls across to another doctor. 
MILITARY DOCTOR 1 John come and take a look at this kid's blood sample. MILITARY DOCTOR 2 walks across. He sees the sample on the screen. 
MILITARY DOCTOR 2. Is that right? That can't be right. 
MILITARY DOCTOR 1 And I got a sample of her hair. MILITARY DOCTOR 2 looks at the results, baffled. 
MILITARY DOCTOR 2 That must be contamination. 
MARISSA Send the results straight to me. On the screen FALSE MARISSA is talking to HANNA. 
FALSE MARISSA Did he tell you where he was going? We're all worried about him. On the CCTV Hanna looks at the FALSE MARISSA. She begins to cry, holds out her arms to be held. 
61 INT. CAMP G. OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS 61 
The MONITOR sees her cry and turns to LEWIS who is still half- embroiled in the tests discussion. 
MONITOR Sir look. LEWIS looks at HANNA. 
62 INT. HANNA'S HOLDING CELL - CONTINUOUS 62 
The FALSE MARISSA tentatively takes HANNA in her arms. 
FALSE MARISSA It's OK. It's OK. HANNA coils her thin arms around the FALSE MARISSA'S neck, clinging to her like a monkey. The FALSE MARISSA looks up to the security camera, slightly concerned. Hanna wriggles in her arms, to get a better grip... 
63 INT. OPERATIONAL HQ. LANGLEY - CONTINUOUS 63 
MARISSA watches this strange image of her false self hugging this young girl. HANNA begins to weep more and more, burrowing her face into the FALSE MARISSA. On the CCTV we hear. 
BURTON (V.O.) You want me to give her something? 
64 INT. HANNA'S HOLDING CELL - CONTINUOUS 64 
HANNA clutching on to FALSE MARISSA, nestles close, weeping. 
FALSE MARISSA I think it might be necessary. 
65 INT. OPERATIONAL HQ. LANGLEY. CONT. 65 
MARISSA watches, now concerned. Something is wrong. 
MARISSA Get her out of there. 
66 INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE HANNA'S HOLDING CELL - CONTINUOUS 66 
Burton comes rushing down the corridor filling a syringe as he goes. He arrives at HANNA'S door. 
BURTON Open up. The first guard opens HANNA'S door. 
LEWIS (V.O.) Abort. I repeat. Abort. 
67 INT. HANNA'S HOLDING CELL - CONTINUOUS 67 
Hanna hugs, weeping, on to the FALSE MARISSA. BURTON hears the instruction to abort but too late... ...as suddenly and with total efficiency HANNA SNAPS the FALSE MARISSA's neck. 
68 INT. OPERATIONAL HQ. LANGLEY. DAY. CONT. 68 
MARISSA stares in shock as her false self slumps dead to the floor. Then she watches as HANNA grabs the first GUARDS handgun from his holster and fires two rounds into Burton's skull. And two more into the first GUARD's chest. 
69 INT. CAMP G. OBSERVATION ROOM. CONT. 69 
LEWIS immediately presses the Alarm Bell. 
LEWIS Jee-sus wept! On another screen LEWIS watches as the other Guard tries to drag the metal door shut. He hits a fleshy door jam - Burton. Hanna is upon him. Two shots. 
70 INT. LANGLEY. OPERATIONAL HQ. CONT. 70 
MARISSA watches HANNA aim straight at camera. HANNA'S fierce eyes looking at her, MARISSA cant help but pull away from the screen. HANNA fires and the screen goes blank. 
71 INT. CAMP G. OBSERVATION ROOM. CONT. 71 
LEWIS watches as, one after another, his camera's go down. But still there's no sign of HANNA. 
83 EXT. MOROCCAN DESERT. DAY. 83 
The truck moves off a short distance and stops again. Meanwhile a large convoy of Military Vehicles passes right over HANNA. When it has past she sees the first vehicle crawling to a halt right near the hole - just yards away. One of the MILITARY PERSONNEL in the jeep gets out and goes over to the hole, lifts the lid, inspects the darkness. The Truck radio is on and we hear the voice. 
MILITARY VOICE Can you confirm your position 473? Banks? Banks can you hear me? 
Once BANKS is satisfied he walks away a few paces, gets out a pair of high powered binoculars, looks this way and that. He walks up a dune and scans the dunes with his binoculars. Finally he walks back and climbs into the Jeep, gets on the radio. 
BANKS. I'm at a perimeter opening at the far east wing. Something's not quite right... He doesn't notice but the lid is open now and the air- conditioning duct is empty. 
CUT TO: As the Jeep moves off we see HANNA is clinging to the axle, hanging upside down underneath. Her face is pressed to the oily metal, her back just an inch from the desert floor flashing beneath her. The jeeps now take a track along the edge of a steep dune. HANNA takes her chance and lets go of her grip. She clenches her eyes shut as the jeep passes over her. As soon as the jeeps clears she rolls herself over the edge of the dune. HANNA rolls down the sand dune at speed until finally she slows and stops. She lies still and shocked by the quiet as the Jeep disappears into the distance. Then she sits up and looks around herself. She has no conception of this landscape, no idea where she might be. 
84 INT. MARISSA'S APARTMENT. VIRGINIA. USA - NIGHT 84 
MARISSA moves between her wardrobe and a suitcase packing clothes, underwear, another power suit. Fully packed she goes to the back of the wardrobe and pulls aside some dresses to reveal a hidden safe. She keys in the security code, the safe door opens and from the back of the safe Marissa retrieves a blue file. MARISSA looks at the files title in large blunt letters: 
GALINKA. 
85 EXT. FOREST ROAD - FLASHBACK 85 
FLASHBACK to 1995. A much younger MARISSA watching a very fast-moving car on a deserted forest road. She takes from her pocket a small detonating device and as the car approaches a bend, presses it. 
There is a small explosion and the car swerves off the road and smashes headlong into a post. The horn starts to blare. MARISSA approaches the car. The road is empty. MARISSA looks through binoculars at the car. She sees a woman, on the passenger side, head thrust forward. JOHANNA ZADEK. Blood everywhere. MARISSA shoots her in the head just to be sure. But the driver's seat is empty. MARISSA stops dead. Then the back door opens on the other side. A man, a younger ERIK HELLER crawls out. He is holding a two year old child in his hands. The child's coat is covered in blood. MARISSA stares at the shocked child and takes the rifle to her eye to shoot again. As she does, ERIK senses her movement and throws himself to the ground. Through the rifle viewfinder we see just a glimpse of ERIK and the red glare of the coat covered in blood, ERIK HELLER grabbing the child and sprinting for the forest, MARISSA taking aim at HELLER, and then firing as HELLER dives into the forest. 
86 INT. MARISSA'S APARTMENT. VIRGINIA. USA - NIGHT 86 
PRESENT DAY. MARISSA puts on a pair of rubber kitchen gloves and sets fire to the file in the sink. When it's all burnt up she switches on the garbage disposal and pushes the ashen remains down the gurgler with a dish mop. 
87 EXT. MOROCCAN DESERT - LATER 87 
The sun has dipped a little now, the shadows of the dunes are longer, but the heat is still intense. HANNA's throat is parched by the dry heat, her pale eyes scorched by the angry sun. She walks purposefully but with a growing awareness of her tiny scale in this seemingly endless sea of sand. She has no conception of this landscape, no idea where she might be. 
HANNA 
(MUTTERING) I live in Leipzig. German city... 0.7 Million people... I go to school at the Klaus Kohle Gymnasium... literature and sport... I have a dog called Trudi. 
HANNA climbs a steep dune, eyes down, feet pounding. A shadow falls across her path and she looks up to see the shape of a GIRL standing at the top of the dune silhouetted by the sun. HANNA's hand goes to the concealed gun. The GIRL stares at HANNA. They must be about the same age but there the resemblance ends. HANNA, dusty, bloodied and bruised in military top, trousers and boots stares at this perfect image of western adolescence. Dressed head to toe in pink and drinking a can of coke, no concession to where she is whatsoever. This is SOPHIE LYALL. 
SOPHIE Hello. HANNA stares at her, then abruptly turns to walk in opposite direction until she sees another convoy of US military trucks in the distance. 
SOPHIE (CONT'D) All right? HANNA turns back. Looks at SOPHIE. Like a wary animal. 
SOPHIE (CONT'D) Don't you speak English? HANNA is unsure how to speak to this strange person. 
SOPHIE (CONT'D) That can't be helped. You look terrible. At that moment SOPHIE'S brother, MILES, eight years old, rises over the dune and stands by SOPHIE'S side. In his hand is a stills camera, not digital, film. MILES stares at HANNA while talking to SOPHIE. 
MILES Who's she? 
SOPHIE I don't know. I just found her. 
MILES What's her name? 
SOPHIE She can't talk. 
HANNA Hanna. 
MILES She talked. 
HANNA I live in Leipzig. German city. Population 0.7 Million people. We live at Number 7 Weissingerplatz. I go to school at the Klaus Kohle Gymnasium and my best friends are Rudi Gunter and Clara Schliess. I like literature and sport, in particular tennis and athletics. 
MILES 
(RE' HANNA) She's weird. 
HOTEL OWNER Where's your family? 
HANNA Are you Arab? 
HOTEL OWNER I'm Moroccan. 
HANNA Morocco. Capital city Rabat. Places of interest. Marrakesh. Essouaira. Religion Islam. Language Arabic (in Arabic w/ English 
SUBTITLES) I like Arabic very much. It's like Japanese. It's big. The HOTEL OWNER nearly spits out his biscuit in shock. 
HOTEL OWNER (in Arabic w/ English 
SUBTITLES) You speak Arabic? 
HANNA (in Arabic w/ English 
SUBTITLES) Yes, of course. 
HOTEL OWNER (in Arabic w/ English 
SUBTITLES) Where's your family? 
HANNA (in Arabic w/ English 
SUBTITLES) I need a room for one night. Can you help? I don't have any money. 
92 INT. MOROCCAN HOTEL BEDROOM - EVENING 92 
The HOTEL OWNER leads HANNA into a simple whitewashed hotel room with twin beds. They speak in Arabic with English subtitles. 
HOTEL OWNER It's the best we've got. 
HANNA Thank you. HANNA stares at the light switch. 
HANNA (CONT'D) Do you have one of these in every room? 
HOTEL OWNER Of course. All mod cons. 
HANNA It's electricity? The HOTEL OWNER looks at HANNA askance. 
HOTEL OWNER Yes. 
HANNA I know a little bit about electricity. They say Edison discovered it, or was it Franklin? 
HOTEL OWNER Some American, I'm sure. He picks up an electric kettle. 
HOTEL OWNER (CONT'D) Electric kettle for the English - they like to make their own tea. He switches it on, Hanna stares as it heats up noisily. He goes to a small wall mounted TV, switches it on for her, a fuzzy, terrible picture of an Arabic TV show. HANNA is fascinated, doesn't take her eyes off the TV as she sits on the edge of the bed. 
HANNA What is it? 
HOTEL OWNER It's the best we can do. She stares at the picture, bemused. 
HOTEL OWNER (CONT'D) Where do you come from? Distracted, HANNA is caught off guard. 
HANNA The forest. The HOTEL OWNER smiles, himself a little puzzled by this strange encounter, and leaves. She just sits there staring at the TV as it's volume seems to increase. Meanwhile the electric kettle begins to boil. Steam pours from its spout and the whole contraption starts to rattle violently. 
HANNA gets up and approaches the kettle very warily. She tries the light switch in an attempt to stop the kettle, but it keeps boiling and making its strange rattle. HANNA tries another switch, the ceiling fan begins to turn, confusing HANNA even more. On the TV the news shows footage of war in the Middle East, the sound of gunfire. The ceiling fan is at its top speed, it's blades cut the air like a helicopter. A telephone beside the bed starts to ring. Combined the noises rise to a terrifying crescendo. HANNA backs away towards the bathroom. She stumbles and falls through the bathroom door straight into the shower, inadvertently turning the taps on. Water pours down on her. HANNA springs up and turns to face the stream of water as if it were an attacker. She runs back into the bedroom. In the bedroom the kettle is still having a violent tantrum, the TV is still screaming, the fan still cutting, the phone still shouting. HANNA pulls at the exit door, but doesn't know to turn the handle. She panics. Smashes at the door. Eventually she falls through the door and into the corridor. 
93 INT. MOROCCAN HOTEL CORRIDOR - EVENING 93 
Silence as HANNA sits on the corridor floor catching her breath. A little way down the corridor MILES and SOPHIE emerge from their bedroom. 
MILES Look. It's that girl. He nudges SOPHIE. HANNA eyes them suspiciously. 
MARISSA Sure, just as soon as she's done breaking peoples necks. You get her sectioned, if you can catch her. The drinks arrive, MARISSA drinks. 
MARISSA (CONT'D) Right now she's in Morocco but she'll be trying to get out of the country. Find her and bring her to me. Quietly. 
ISAACS I'll need funds. MARISSA slides an envelope of bills across the table. 
MARISSA Don't spend it all on candy. She glances meaningfully at the STRIPPERS, who have been eyeing up ISAACS as a potential mark. ISAACS looks at the money. When he looks back up MARISSA is already walking out the door. 
95 EXT. NIGHT MARKET RESTAURANT. OASIS TOWN - NIGHT 95 
HANNA is sitting at a table with the FAMILY who are all eating falafel while HANNA eats meat. SOPHIE and MILES parents, RACHEL and SEB, have some difficulty relating to their daughters attitudes. They belong to a generation of counter cultural radicals whose priorities have, over the past decade, shifted and they're now trying to assimilate into mainstream society whilst still holding on to their ideals of autonomy and social liberation. SOPHIE is describing a recent cultural phenomenon while she picks at her food. 
SOPHIE She's beautiful. I wish I had a body like hers. She's really cool too. She's married to a footballer and really loves him - 
Meanwhile HANNA eyes the crowd, constantly on the look out. 
SOPHIE (CONT'D) - only the papers found out he was shagging like loads of other girls so she went and got all successful in her own right and now does a make-over show where she turns right dogs into real babes. I could do you a make-over if you'd like? 
RACHEL Perhaps Hanna doesn't want a make- over, sweetie. SOPHIE ignores RACHEL and addresses all her responses to 
HANNA. 
SOPHIE Rachel doesn't believe in making the best of yourself. 
RACHEL No Sophie, I just don't believe fourteen year-old girls should be dressing to look like porn stars. It objectifies them. 
SOPHIE 
(TO HANNA) Do you shave your armpits yet? 
HANNA I don't think so. 
RACHEL Good. Keep it that way. 
SOPHIE That's SOOO gross. 
RACHEL Do you often travel on your own, Hanna? 
HANNA My father encourages me to be independent. 
SEB And your mother? 
HANNA She's dead. 
SEB Oh, I'm sorry. 
SOPHIE Nice one, Dad. 
HANNA People die. 
MILES What did she die of? 
HANNA Three bullets. 
RACHEL Oh. God. How terrible. SOPHIE is weirdly impressed. 
96 EXT/INT. BUTCHERS SHOP. SOUTH SWEDEN - NIGHT 96 
ERIK HELLER, still wearing his three piece suit, enters a tiny provincial Swedish butchers shop and walks up to the counter. He checks around to make sure no one is following him before approaching the BUTCHER and slapping some cash on the counter. 
HELLER Three pounds of goose fat if you please. 
97 INT. MOROCCAN HOTEL CORRIDOR - LATER 97 
ISAACS watches closely every car that approaches the ferry from behind his dark glasses. He sees the FAMILY have joined a cue of vehicles and are having their papers checked. Then they're waved on board. He scrutinises them but has no reason to suspect anything. 
106 INT. FERRY CAR DECK. - DAY 106 
Cars are parking, their headlights on in the dark hull, horns blowing, FERRY GUARDS directing people to parking spaces - it's chaos. SEB parks the van with some difficulty, complaining all the while. 
SEB Typical. Get me back to the European Union. 
RACHEL Don't be rude. They get out, taking with them anything they might need - knapsacks, computer games, suit cases. They head off towards the stairs up to the decks, passing ISAACS on their way. ISAACS searches between the cars and trucks. He passes the back of the FAMILY'S van as the camera pushes in on its back door. The handle is being JIGGLED FROM INSIDE. 
107 INT. VAN/FERRY CAR DECK - DAY 107 
Inside, the van is as the family left it, but the bench seats around the breakfast table are disturbed. One has been opened out, the lid taken off, the mattress strewn on the floor - inside is a big storage space where HANNA has evidently hidden... The crowbar has been discarded there. HANNA is trying to get out. She tries the back door but its locked. She climbs over the seats and climbs into the front cabin, the driver's seat. She finds a lock on the door and unlocks. She climbs out. 
108 EXT. LOWER FERRY DECK - DAY 108 
HANNA walks out on deck and sees the sea, the sight of it takes her breath away. She walks to the railings and looks over the edge. Then up at the seagulls following the boat. A little way off the FAMILY are sitting eating ice-creams. SOPHIE lies out on a bench sunning herself. 
RACHEL What has got into you? Oh my God, look over there. They all look where she is pointing - at HANNA. 
SOPHIE It's her. 
SEB You think she... you don't think she... Rachel, the sunroof? 
RACHEL You think we should say something? 
SEB What's there to say? 
RACHEL Maybe she's in trouble. 
SEB Maybe she's a hooker. Or a terrorist. There's a lot of them in Germany. 
SOPHIE Hookers or terrorists? 
RACHEL I'll go over. 
SEB Rachel, walk away. I'm insisting here. I'm putting my foot down... RACHEL heads off towards HANNA, SOPHIE follows. 
CUT TO: SOPHIE and RACHEL approach HANNA and move to positions either side of her. 
SOPHIE All right? 
HANNA Did you know that 71 percent of the earths surface is covered in water? 
SOPHIE My father thinks you're a stowaway. He thinks you broke our sunroof too, which puts you in deep shit. 
RACHEL Sophie just - I'll handle this. 
(TO HANNA) Where's your father? No reply. 
RACHEL (CONT'D) I really think it might help if you told us the, you know, the truth and all that. Have you run away from somewhere? 
SOPHIE Are you okay? 
HANNA I'm fine. 
RACHEL I'm worried about you. 
SOPHIE She said she's fine. 
RACHEL You have to understand this really is a problem for us. 
SOPHIE You know what? Why don't I stay here with her and you go off and be with dad? He's looking kind of tense. 
SOPHIE Says who? SOPHIE heads off down the road. HANNA weighs the situation and then quickens her pace to catch up with SOPHIE. 
128 EXT. RAVE AT ROMAN AMPHITHEATRE. NIGHT. 128 
A loud out door rave in a Roman amphitheatre. SOPHIE and HANNA stand at the top of the amphitheatre looking down on the thrilling spectacle, soaking up the bass, the abstract sounds, the sheer volume, the pulsing lights and electric atmosphere - HANNA is thrilled and startled. Many of the crowd seem to be wearing fancy dress. HANNA stares at a girl dressed as a red ladybird. 
CUT TO: The girls approach a bar and SOPHIE goes to order. She's forced to mime and shout her order over the music. 
SOPHIE Vodka. Two. 
The bartender shakes his head and holds up two bottles of water. 
BARTENDER Water only. No booze. Meanwhile HANNA spots FELICIANO, the handsome SPANISH BOY from the camp site shop, across the dance floor. He is staring at her again. SOPHIE comes back with two bottles of water and hands one to 
HANNA. 
HANNA What do they call this music? 
SOPHIE Banging. HANNA stares at the dancers, people losing themselves in it - SOPHIE just grins, starts to move to the music. HANNA smiles awkwardly, tries to copy SOPHIE. 
CUT TO: ISAACS enters the rave followed by two of his HENCHMEN. They split up and start to survey the crowd. Over in a secluded corner ISAACS sees a drug deal taking place. ISAACS sidles over to the DEALER and his PUNTER. The PUNTER, thinking ISAACS is probably a cop, makes a hasty getaway. 
ISAACS What you got? 
DEALER (in Spanish w/ English 
SUBTITLES) Nothing man. That guys just a friend. ISAACS frisks the DEALER, nothing. He turns the DEALER against the wall and checks his socks where he finds a stash of tiny baggies each containing a gram or two of white powder. ISAACS samples the powder and pockets the lot. 
DEALER (CONT'D) (in Spanish w/ English 
SUBTITLES) Hey, you're not police. What the fuck? ISAACS turns as he walks away and puts a finger to his lips. 
ISAACS Ssh. 
CUT TO: Back near the bar HANNA and SOPHIE are approached by a couple of scrawny SPANISH BOYS in day-glow tops. 
SPANISH BOY (in Spanish w/ English 
SUBTITLES) Where are you from? The girls just look at each other. 
SPANISH BOY (CONT'D) English? American? You like to party? They watch, puzzled, as SOPHIE smiles disinterestedly and leads HANNA away. 
HANNA Will you teach me to do dancing? 
SOPHIE It's easy. HANNA and SOPHIE walk onto the dance floor and begin to dance. HANNA starts by dancing like a five year-old, swinging her arms jerkily and lifting her feet as if walking through a field. But soon her movements become more sophisticated and expressive. 
CUT TO: ISAACS is searching through the crowd. He eyes the bodies around him greedily. He takes another dab of the white powder and rubs it into his gums. 
CUT TO: Back on the dance floor, HANNA and SOPHIE are dancing. FELICIANO approaches through the crowd followed by a FRIEND. THEY start to circle HANNA and SOPHIE, dancing, insinuating their way in. 
SOPHIE (CONT'D) He's after you. 
HANNA How can you tell? 
SOPHIE Duh, look at the way he's looking at you. He's gorgeous. FELICIANO'S FRIEND approaches SOPHIE, he's not bad looking either. 
FELICIANO'S FRIEND What's your name? 
SOPHIE Sophie. 
FELICIANO'S FRIEND Have you come here before? 
SOPHIE All the time. 
MARISSA - What's in the past, stays in the past, right? 
KATRIN Something like that. 
MARISSA So why all the years of snooping around and sticking your nose in? 
KATRIN You'd understand if you had kids. She turns her back on MARISSA. 
MARISSA Kid's, they fuck you up, don't they? 
MARISSA stands up, puts a 9mm to the back KATRIN'S head and pulls the trigger. KATRIN drops to the floor revealing a framed, blood splattered, photograph of KATRIN ZADEK'S daughter - JOANNA. 
131 INT. TENT. SPANISH CAMPSITE. EARLY DAWN. 131 
HANNA and SOPHIE lie next to each other in sleeping bags with a torch between them. 
SOPHIE Can't you sleep? 
HANNA No. 
SOPHIE Me neither. SOPHIE pauses. Looks at her. 
SOPHIE (CONT'D) Hanna? 
HANNA Yes? 
SOPHIE Where do you really come from? 
HANNA Leipzig, I live in Leipzig - SOPHIE looses her patience. 
SOPHIE If we're going to be friends you have to be honest with me. Them's the rules. HANNA is taken aback. 
HANNA Are we friends? 
SOPHIE Yes. I like you. 
HANNA I'd like to have a friend. 
SOPHIE I mean you're a freak and everything, but I like you. 
HANNA I like you too. I really do. But there are things I can't tell you. Do you understand? 
SOPHIE Yes... Actually, no, I don't. 
HANNA There are people that want to harm me. Bad people. 
SOPHIE I see. 
HANNA And they wont stop. 
SOPHIE Right. 
HANNA So for your own safety... HANNA looks into SOPHIE'S eyes. 
HANNA (CONT'D) Can we still be friends? 
SOPHIE I don't know. I mean, I don't really know who you are. Do I? 
HANNA That's just it. Neither do I. She reaches into her bag. Brings out the DNA report. Shows it to Sophie. They read. Interfering Sequence. Abnormal. 
SOPHIE What is it? 
HANNA I think it's about me. DNA is kind of how we're made I think. I mean who we are. They look at it. 
136 INT. ISAACS' BMW - CONTINUOUS 136 
ISAACS holds onto the dash. 
ISAACS Keep your distance. 
137 INT. DANISH HOSTEL - DAY 137 
The RECEPTIONIST picks up the phone and dials. 
RECEPTIONIST Is that the police? Yes, I don't want to trouble you but I have a new guest you may wish to know about. 
138 EXT. VESTERBROGADE STATION/COPENHAGEN. DAY. 138 
A commuter train pulls into the vast station. Amongst the morning commuters alighting the train is ERIK HELLER. He looks furtively around, and tries to blend in with the crowd. 
POV - from a walkway above the station - someone is watching HELLER as he tries to conceal himself within the throng. A DANISH AGENT, hidden on a metal walkway above the platform. On the platform HELLER walks amongst the commuters, past the ticket collectors, past another DANISH AGENT posing as a commuter - he stops and lingers by him, noting something not right. He moves off and enters a small bar. The second AGENT immediately follows and from the walkway, the other rushes downstairs to give chase too. HELLER walks through the bar into the toilets, finds a FIRE EXIT and walks out through it. 
139 EXT. GOODS YARD/VESTERBROGADE STATION - DAY 139 
HELLER finds himself in a goods yard adjoining the train station. He walks through the goods yard, then suddenly, and apparently for no reason, stops dead, then throws himself behind a skip of empty bottles. As he does two new men, AMERICAN SPECIAL OPS, run round the corner into the goods yard. From the fire exit, the DANISH AGENTS EMERGE and after signalling to each other, head off to the perimeter. The various agents scour the yard. The SPECIAL OPS get closer to HELLER's hiding place. HELLER suddenly emerges from his hiding place and sticks an elbow in the face of one, a knee in the groin of another. There's a brief exchange of blows. One of the SPECIAL OPS draws his hand gun. HELLER produces a knife out of nowhere and launches at the man, cutting him on the hand, making him drop his gun. He stabs the other in the eye and the man falls to the ground squealing. HELLER leans in and takes from the man's pocket his 
CELLPHONE. HELLER makes a run for it. One of the SPECIAL OPS lets off a shot, the bullet clipping HELLER in the leg. He falters but limps off behind the towering containers. 
140 EXT. FRENCH ROAD - DAY 140 
The FAMILY van is making its way up through France. 
Following in the black BMW, a few cars behind, ISAACS and his HENCHMEN are biding their time. 
141 INT. VAN/FRENCH ROAD - EVENING 141 
RACHEL is driving, while HANNA rides in the front seat keeping her entertained. 
HANNA ...they can live at freezing temperatures for up to nine months without food. Imagine that, nine months. 
RACHEL Why do you know so much about fleas? 
HANNA I read it in my Encyclopaedia. HANNA is looking in the side view mirror. She sees ISAACS BMW and frowns, she's seen it before. 
HANNA (CONT'D) Also, they can jump around 200 times their own body length, which makes them the best jumpers of all known animals except for the froghopper. Now they can really jump. RACHEL makes a turn and HANNA checks the side view mirror again. Yes, the BMW is still there. HANNA becomes anxious. 
RACHEL Everything all right? 
HANNA I think so. But HANNA'S face betrays her concern. 
JOANNA (V.O.) Mama, I know you're disappointed in me, I know it. I'm so sorry, Mama. But I have found maybe a way to make it better... 
142 INT. HOTEL SUITE. COPENHAGEN - NIGHT 142 
CLOSE ON - a portable casette machine playing one of the tapes MARISSA discovered at KATRIN ZADEK'S. 
JOANNA (V.O.) I'm in a program now... a program to make babies stronger. In an adjoining bathroom MARISSA, in a pair of cotton pyjamas, is brushing her teeth. Her lips pulled back in a snarl. 
JOANNA (V.O.) An American program. It's very scientific. Important scientific work. Still brushing MARISSA walks through to the tape machine and presses fast forward. Then play - 
JOANNA (V.O.) Erik says he can get these tapes to 
YOU - 
MARISSA 
(MUTTERS) Bastard. 
MARISSA Three days ago Hanna's father killed two Danish policemen on a beach with a hunting knife. 
SEB Where is he now? 
MARISSA He's still at large and he's still very dangerous. We need to find Hanna before he does. Pause. SOPHIE thinks about it but clams up. Marissa notices. 
MARISSA (CONT'D) If you know anything at all, it's vital you tell us for her own safety. We are now very worried about her. 
But SOPHIE doesn't say a word. 
RACHEL Sophie? Still nothing. They all look at her. MILES suddenly speaks. 
MILES She's going to Berlin. To Wilhelm Grimm's house. 
SOPHIE (TO MILES) You little bastard! 
RACHEL How did you know that? 
SOPHIE You fuckwad! SOPHIE slaps MILES over the back of the head but SEB pushes her back. 
SEB Hey hey hey! Sophie for God's sake. 
153 EXT. BERLIN CANALS - DAY 153 
HANNA'S sits on the prow of the barge as it makes it's slow progress into Berlin. 
154 INT/EXT. CAR/STREET - DAY 154 
MARISSA looks out at a school playground as she waits in the back of her car. The passenger door next to her opens and ISAACS gets in. 
ISAACS I've looked through Heller's contacts from the 1980's. There's no one called Wilhelm. 
MARISSA Wilhelm Grimm wrote fairy-tales. He died two hundred years ago. MARISSA hands ISAACS a brown envelope containing one of the photographs she took from KATRIN'S apartment. The photograph shows a happy looking JOANNA and ERIK at a busy family amusement park. Between ERIK and JOANNA is a clown, his arms around both of them. This we will come to understand is KLAUS KNEPFLER. Behind them is a GRIMM'S 
BROTHERS HOUSE OF FUN. 
ISAACS What the hell is this? MARISSA smiles slightly. 
MARISSA Wilhelm's house. (to the DRIVER) Drive on. 
155 EXT. BERLIN STREETS - DAY 155 
HANNA wanders through the skyscrapers and glass constructions of Berlin. People swarm around her but pay her no mind. 
156 INT. TRAM - DAY 156 
HANNA is riding a tram to the outskirts of town. 
157 EXT. ABANDONNED AMUSEMENT PARK - DAY 157 
HANNA walks beside a wire mesh fence that separates her from an abandoned amusement park. Behind her is an enormous steel works from which great industrial plumes of steam rise. HANNA climbs under the fence and walks through this surreal playground long since reclaimed by nature. There are huge fibreglass dinosaurs toppled over with heads missing and abandoned dinosaur legs. Rising above the park, surrounded by a muddy moat, is the big wheel now standing at a vertiginous angle. In front of the big wheel is the WILHELM GRIMM HOUSE. The house is a Grimm Brothers fairytale theme âFun House'. It's windows long since shuttered, vines growing through its roof. HANNA stands in front of the house in deep anticipation. She walks up the small steps that lead to the front door and knocks. She waits, heart sinking at the thought of there being no-one home. Then, ever so slightly the door opens and peering out at her is a man with the sad face of an out of work clown. 
KNEPFLER Excuse me young lady? It is the man from the photo, but twenty years older. Small, with a wiry intensity. 
HANNA Are you Wilhelm Grimm? 
KNEPFLER Not exactly, but it'll do for now. Come this way. He leads her inside. 
158 INT. WILHELM GRIMM'S HOUSE - DAY 158 
They come inside - it's old and full of hoarded junk, antiques, boxes, books, dusty china, lamps, figurines, but still functional - an old man's home. He stops to look at her. 
KNEPFLER So you are Hanna. He puts out his hand to shake. 
161 INT. RECEPTION. WILHELM GRIMM'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 161 
KNEPFLER points HANNA towards a set of stairs that lead up from the reception. 
KNEPFLER Upstairs. There's a knock at the door. HANNA begins to climb the stairs while KNEPFLER approaches the front door. There's another knock at the door. 
162 INT. GRANDMA'S ROOM. WILHELM GRIMM'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 162 
HANNA enters a room that's been designed to look like Grandma's bedroom from Little Red Riding Hood. HANNA hurriedly slides under the bed. Breathing as quietly as she can. She can hear the sound of ISAAC'S MEN starting to spread through the house. 
KNEPFLER (O.O.V) Listen to me, listen. There is no one here. There is nobody up there... 
MARISSA (O.C.) Check the attic. Footsteps to the attic. 
163 INT. WILHELM GRIMM'S HOUSE/STARS - DAY 163 
MARISSA has KNEPFLER cornered on the stairs. 
MARISSA Erik Heller? Do you know him? 
KNEPFLER I have never heard of him. 
MARISSA Really? MARISSA shows him the photograph of JOANNA, ERIK and KNEPFLER outside the house. 
KNEPFLER I don't know these people. 
MARISSA Think very carefully He shrugs and MARISSA grabs KNEPFLER by the throat. He speaks in gasps. 
KNEPFLER He called me. She's coming soon. To meet him. 
MARISSA When? 
KNEPFLER Tomorrow! Tomorrow morning. MARISSA lets him go. She turns to ISAACS. 
MARISSA Take him in there. Find out what he knows. 
164 INT. GRANDMA'S ROOM. WILHELM GRIMM'S HOUSE - DAY 164 
The sound of KNEPFLER being escorted into a next-door room, the door shutting. The sound of footsteps coming into the room. HANNA silent under the bed. MARISSA'S GREEN SHOES are in sight, nothing else. The green shoes come close and HANNA feels the mattress compress as MARISSA sits on the bed. She looks at the shoes as she hears her call. 
MARISSA Lewis. It's Marissa. HANNA hears the name. The name of the woman she thought she had killed. Her face pale in shock and fear. 
MARISSA (CONT'D) You got anything? He's coming here. I can smell it. Double the men. But, Lewis, I want to talk to him. HANNA hears MARISSA hang. Another pair of shoes enter the room. Male. ISAACS. 
ISAACS His name's Klaus Knepfler. He used to send Heller's things from Berlin before the Communists were kicked out of Prague. 
MARISSA How much does he know about the programme? 
ISAACS Everything. He knew Johanna. 
MARISSA What does he know about the child? 
ISAACS He also thinks Erik's the father. 
MARISSA Well that's good. 
ISAACS Everybody thinks Erik's her father. Erik probably thinks he's her father. They snigger. HANNA's eyes widen in shock. She can barely control her breath. 
MARISSA Crazy bastard. You got a fix on him yet? 
ISAACS Let's see what else Knepfler has to offer. He leaves her. MARISSA suddenly senses something. Did she hear an intake of breath? She turns and quickly looks under the bed. No one there. Her imagination maybe. MARISSA stands and we see the shoes walk away to the door. They reach the door. HANNA, clinging to the bedsprings in mid- air, not breathing. The green shoes leave. HANNA breathes. Hurriedly she climbs out from under the bed and goes to a window. 
165 EXT. WILHELM GRIMM'S HOUSE - DAY 165 
181 EXT. ESTATE BUILDINGS - CONTINUOUS 181 
CLOSE ON - HANNA continuing to walk away. She hears a single gun shot. Stops dead. Knows what it means. An intense conflict of emotions inside her. Her breathing stops for a moment, her world seems to go silent. Then a car flies by on the main road, almost running her over, and she is woken. She sees a bus stop ahead. On auto- pilot she runs to it, a bus coming, she beckons. It stops and she is on board. 
182 EXT. WASTELAND. EAST BERLIN. 182 
MARISSA stands over the dead body of ERIK HELLER. 
MARISSA Leave him here. And they all walk away leaving him alone in the East Berlin dirt. 
183 INT. BUS, EAST BERLIN. 183 
HANNA on the bus. Shaking from the shock of his death, bloodied slightly from the fight. The other passengers stare at her as she forces back the tears. HANNA reaches in her pocket for a handkerchief, but only pulls out the letter Erik showed her. The Galinka letter. She sees the address. Galinka, Ostrovska district, Poland. HANNA makes a decision. She is going back to where she was born. She must find out who she is. 
184 INT. ESTATE BUILDING. KATRIN ZADEK'S FLAT. 184 
MARISSA enters the apartment. And looks at the chaos. ISAACS comes up behind her. HENCHMEN at the door. 
ISAACS They had a fight. 
MARISSA She must know the truth. 
ISAACS Where do you think she's gone? 
MARISSA Where would you go? MARISSA turns to ISAACS. 
MARISSA (CONT'D) I'm closing the CIA operation down. Heller is dead, that's all that matters to them. This we do alone. 
185 INT. POLISH TRAIN. 185 
HANNA's head rests on the backrest of a train-seat as the train crawls through the Polish/German border. Exhausted, many nights without sleep. Hungry but unable to eat. Needing resolution. In the same carriage a Polish woman sleeps alongside her child of two, also sleeping. HANNA looks at the child. The peace of the innocent. 
186 EXT. POLISH TRAIN STATION. NIGHT. 186 
The train entering a Polish train station. The town is called Ostrovska. Freezing cold. The town is in the North of Poland and it's very poor. Industrial. Bleak. HANNA exits, approaches a station guard. 
HANNA I am looking for a train to Galinka. 
GUARD Galinka is a small village. No trains. You must wait for bus in the morning. 
HANNA Where can I stay? He points. HANNA sees the hotel. 
187 INT. POLISH HOTEL. BEDROOM. NIGHT. 187 
HANNA enters the tiny, dank hotel room. She looks at the filthy carpet, the grey ceiling. She turns on the tiny TV. Cartoons. Tom and Jerry type stuff. But she doesn't laugh. She flicks channel. Then stands dead still. She is looking at ERIK HELLER's dead body on the ground. The report depicts him as a dangerous criminal. HANNA stares at the image. The death of the man she spent her life with. Lost forever. HANNA's face oddly still in the TV flicker. Then she flicks it off. Leaves the room. 
188 INT. POLISH HOTEL. FOYER/BAR - NIGHT. 188 
HANNA, exhausted, sleepless and starving, comes down the shabby hotel stairs and enters the hotel bar. Grim. Empty room, old carpet, bad smell, dated pop music. Three hard- drinking men stare at her, making her uncomfortable as she goes to the bar. A forty-five year old BUSINESSMAN stands there, drinking. 
HANNA Do you have a sandwich? 
BARMAN Kitchen is closed. The BUSINESSMAN speaks in German. 
BUSINESSMAN Get her something. Poor girl's hungry. The barman disappears. HANNA looks round, waits. 
BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D) I'm from Leipzig. HANNA flinches at the name. Leipzig. 
BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D) You? 
HANNA The same. 
BUSINESSMAN Business? He looks at her body. HANNA senses it. Her sandwich arrives. It's grim. She leaves it, walks out. 
HANNA Sorry. 
MARISSA It's okay. Are you in trouble? HANNA nods. She fights the tears. MARISSA gently holds her hand as she drives. HANNA weeping. 
MARISSA (CONT'D) What sort of trouble? 
HANNA (though her tears) I don't know what to do. Nothing is what I thought it would be. It's... ugly and cruel and I don't know where to go, or... I'm stupid. I don't know what I expected... MARISSA secretly, genuinely affected by this. Fights the emotion that has surprised her. Human warmth. 
MARISSA Sometimes I feel the same way. 
HANNA eyes her, surprised to hear this from a grown up woman. MARISSA puts on some music. Gentle. Bach maybe. 
HANNA I like music. 
MARISSA Sleep why don't you? You look very tired. It will take half an hour on this road. HANNA nods. She begins to drift off, so long since she has slept. Her eyes fall shut and her head rests against the window. She is asleep. Vulnerable. 
192 EXT. RURAL ROAD - DAWN 192 
Soft dawn light as MARISSA drives on a narrow rural road. 
193 INT. CAR - DAWN 193 
MARISSA looks at the sleeping HANNA. MARISSA represses her gathering emotion. HANNA suddenly looking so young as she sleeps the sleep of the innocent. The rush of emotion shocks her - she is watching HANNA, not the road - and she veers off, nearly crashing the car, narrowly avoiding a tree. She puts her foot sharply on the brake. She's wearing the same GREEN SHOES as she wore at Wilhelm's House. HANNA is jolted awake. 
HANNA Where are we? MARISSA calms herself instantly. 
MARISSA Nearly there. HANNA doesn't see MARISSA'S SHOES. 
194 EXT. GALINKA 194 
MARISSA's car slows as it enters a tiny deserted hamlet. 
MARISSA (V.O.) This is it. 
195 INT. MARISSA'S CAR. 195 
HANNA looks around. There is not much to Galinka. She is confused. 
HANNA It's so small. 
MARISSA Yes. Just a few cottages. And the old bunker. HANNA chooses not to ask any more questions. 
HANNA Thank you for the ride. You're very kind. 
MARISSA I wish there was more I could do for you. MARISSA looks kindly at HANNA who is confused by the intimacy. MARISSA reaches into the glove compartment and retrieves a torch which she hands to HANNA. 
MARISSA (CONT'D) Here, take this. HANNA switches the torch on and off, thinking. 
MARISSA (CONT'D) I hope you find what you're looking for. 
HANNA Thank you. She gets out and shuts the door behind her. 
196 EXT. GALINKA. CONT. 196 
HANNA looks around at the grey desolation, rural poverty, the ends of the earth. In the car MARISSA stares at her, then drives off. HANNA walks through the trees along a track. Overgrown, not used for many years. She reaches a hidden entrance off the track. By the entrance there is an old battered sign. GALINKA. HANNA looks at the old iron gate. Rusted, locked. It has not been opened in a long time. She stares at the sign, tries the gate - yes, locked. Then she climbs the gate. She nearly tears her clothes on the spikes at the top of the gate, then leaps over and, exhausted, four days without real sleep, begins to walk up the narrow tree-lined driveway. 
197 EXT. GALINKA BUNKER - CONTINUOUS 197 
HANNA approaches the gaping mouth of an underground bunker. She stops, looks down at the torch in her hand, switches it on and walks into the darkness. 
198 INT. TUNNELS. GALINKA - CONTINUOUS 198 
With only the torch light to see by HANNA treads warily deeper into the tunnels as, behind her, the small aperture of daylight recedes slowly to nothing. The tunnels seem to stretch on for miles ahead of her. HANNA reaches a junction where four tunnels meet. She shines her torch down each tunnel, trying to decide which way to go. She stops when she sees, a little way down one of the tunnels, a child's forgotten shoe. HANNA steps forward and shines her torch down at the tiny red shoe, its buckle rusted. She walks on into the dark. HANNA finds a door which she pushes at. The door is stiff, but HANNA uses her full weight and soon she's made enough of a gap to squeeze through.

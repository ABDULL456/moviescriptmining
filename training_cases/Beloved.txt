FADE IN... 
EXT. 124 BLUESTONE ROAD - DAWN. 
It is winter in Ohio. A house sits isolated beside a barren field. The field stretches beyond, until a line of distant woods stops it. Around the back of the house stands a rundown STORAGE SHED, a cold house, a privy and a water pump. A porch with a single door serves as the only entrance. 
Camera begins a slow move toward the house as we; 
SUPER - OHIO, 1865 
WE HEAR SOUNDS from inside the house - BUMPS, A CHAIR FALLING OVER...and FEET RUNNING on wooden floor boards. 
CUT TO: 
INT. 124 BLUESTONE ROAD - DAWN. 
C.U. - THE HANDS OF TWO BROTHERS HOLDING EACH OTHER AS THEY RUN DOWN THE STAIRS.. 
BULGAR (13 yrs. old) and HOWARD (14 yrs. old) run down the steps from the second floor. They are fully dressed, carrying a small bag of belongings. 
HOWARD We gonna need food. Wait here. 
Bulgar reluctantly lets go of Howard's hand as the latter runs into the kitchen. Alone, he edges towards the front door, when suddenly; 
THE DOOR SLOWLY CREAKS OPEN on it's own. Scared, he steps away slowly. 
INT. KITCHEN - DAWN. 
Howard is trying to toss some food into a bag. He spots A CAKE sitting on top the wooden table, with some pieces already eaten. He finds a knife and approaches the table. 
He is about to cut into the cake when he sees TWO TINY HAND PRINTS appear on the cake's surface. Howard stops cold - dropping the knife. 
INT. FRONT ENTRANCE - DAWN. 
Howard exits the kitchen and takes Bulgar's hand; 
HOWARD Come on! 
DENVER (OS) Bul? 
The boys look up the stairs and see their baby sister, nine year old DENVER. 
DENVER Where you goin? 
The brothers are brokenhearted at the sight of her. They love their sister. But there are stronger forces here. 
A MIRROR on a wall beside Howard cracks down the middle. 
HOWARD We gotta go! 
Bulgar looks up to Denver. They exchange a look of deep affection and pained longing. He wants to take her. 
HOWARD Bye, Denver. You take care. 
DENVER Bye? Bul? 
Bulgar is starting to cry. He rushes up the steps and hugs his sister. He kisses her hard then breaks away. Denver's outstretched hand misses his shirt and hangs mid-air. 
DENVER No..Bul... 
Bulgar flies down the steps and disappears out of the house holding Howard's hand once more. 
Denver sits alone at the top of the stairs.  She sadly looks up and weeps, as if to the house itself: 
DENVER Now what you go and do that for? 
EXT. ROAD TO THE TRAIN - DAWN. 
THE VOICE OF SETHE HUMMING A MELODY carries over the images of: 
The two boys running for their lives towards the train, holding hands all the way.  Howard is the first to reach it. As it passes by, he throws his bag upon it and jumps in. Bulgar races beside it as Howard reaches for him. 
C.U. - HOWARD'S HAND reaching for BULGAR's...They connect. 
WIDE SHOT - The boys are on the train as it leaves town. 
On it's route, the train passes a ramshackle GRAVEYARD. 
CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY INTO THE GRAVEYARD until it reaches A HEADSTONE, made with flecked pink stone. Upon the headstone is only one word: 
BELOVED. 
EXT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - CONTINUOUS. 
Camera moves slowly towards the side exterior of 124, into a Close-Up of a WOMAN looking out of a second floor bedroom window. It is SETHE, mother of the two boys and Denver. She hums her melody, softly, sadly, with a resigned understanding of why her boys are running away...and a deep pain that is too constant to notice. 
FADE OUT; 
FADE IN: 
INT. 124 - BABY SUGGS BEDROOM - LATER THAT DAY. 
BABY SUGGS, grandmother and mother-in-law to Sethe, sits in her bed fondling colored fabric of BRIGHT GREEN..It is the only vibrant color in an otherwise drab surrounding. Suggs is bed-ridden, exhausted to her bones - her face a mosaic of suffering and sacrifice and tested faith. 
BABY SUGGS Ya know what I'd love to see? I loved to see me some lavender. You got any lavender? Or even pink - pink'll do. 
Sethe is placing folded laundry into a dresser. She stops and checks her pockets for rags or swatches...She looks around the room.. 
SETHE No. Sorry. 
BABY SUGGS Ah, winter in Ohio is especially rough if you've got an appetite for color. 
Suggs goes back to contemplating her green until; 
DENVER About what? 
SETHE Oh, about time. How some things go. Pass on. Some things just stay. 
DENVER What things? 
SETHE Like, the place I was at before here - Sweet Home. Even if that whole farm and every tree and blade of grass on it died - it'll still be there. Waiting. And if you go and stand in the place where it was, what happened there once, will happen again. 
DENVER If it's still there, waiting, that mean nothing ever dies? 
SETHE Nothing ever does. That's why I had to get my children out. No matter what. That's why you can never go there. 
DENVER You never tell me all what happened. Just that they whipped you and you run off pregnant with me. 
SETHE You don't need to know nothing else. 
DENVER (nods) I saw a white dress kneeling next to you when you was praying. 
SETHE White? Maybe it was my bedding dress. Describe it to me. 
DENVER Had a high neck. Whole mess of buttons coming down the back. 
SETHE Buttons. Well, that's not my bedding dress. I never had a button on nothing. What else? 
DENVER A bunch at the back. On the sit down part. 
SETHE A bustle? 
DENVER I don't know what it's called. 
SETHE You say it was holding on to me. How? 
DENVER Kneeling next to you while you were praying. I mean, talking. It looked just like you. 
SETHE Well, I'll be. 
DENVER I think it was a sign. I think maybe baby's got plans. 
SETHE What plans? 
DENVER I don't know, but that dress holding onto you got to mean something. 
SETHE Maybe. Maybe it does. 
Sethe smiles sympathetically for her lonely child. They hear a sound in the house - floor boards creaking. 
DENVER She's crawling again. 
Sethe nods and holds her daughter's hand as they listen. 
FADE OUT; 
SUPER: 1873. 
FADE IN; 
EXT. 124 BLUESTONE ROAD - DAY. 
C.U. - PAUL D. GARNER. 
Paul stands on the road, gazing up at the house. Grateful he's arrived, cautious about what he'll find, he steps towards the porch. His clothes are ragged. His feet sore and blistering in his shoes. 
EXT. THE PUMP - DAY. 
Off to the side of the house, Sethe washes her feet and legs at the pump. She looks up and sees Paul's figure walking towards the house. The sun blazes in her eyes. She can't make out who it is, or whether or not he's even real. As he reaches the porch, Paul disappears from view. 
Sethe walks towards the front of the house. When she is little more than forty feet away, she stops - still not certain Paul is a real man or an hallucination of the past. 
SETHE Paul? Paul D.? Is that you? 
PAUL (smiles) What's left. (He rises) How you been girl, besides barefoot? 
Sethe jams her balled up stockings into her pocket. She smiles like a little girl, not able to believe her eyes. 
SETHE You looking good. 
PAUL Devil's confusion. He lets me look good long as I feel bad. 
SETHE How long has it been? 
PAUL 'Bout eighteen years, I figure. 
SETHE Eighteen years. 
PAUL And I swear I been walking every one of them. Mind if I join you? 
He begins taking off his shoes. 
SETHE You want to soak them? Let me get you some water. 
PAUL No, uh, uh. Can't baby feet. A whole more tramping they got to do yet. 
SETHE You're not leaving right away, are you? You stay awhile. 
PAUL Well, long enough to see Baby Suggs, you..Where is she? 
SETHE Dead. 
PAUL Aw no. When? 
SETHE Eight years now. Almost nine. 
PAUL Was it hard? I hope she didn't die hard. 
SETHE Soft as cream. Being alive was the hard part. Sorry you missed her though. Is that what you came by for? 
PAUL That's some of what I came for. The rest is you. 
Sethe doesn't know what to do with her eyes when he says this..she looks away instinctively. Paul realizes that may have sounded too intimate so he leans back and sighs: 
PAUL The truth be known, I go anywhere these days. Anywhere they let me sit down. 
SETHE Come on inside. 
PAUL Porch is fine. Cool out here. Sit with me. 
EXT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - CONTINUOUS. 
A shirtless Paul D. is by the water pump washing himself. 
INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS. 
Denver lifts the fallen jelly cupboard, it's contents laying in a heap in the corner of the bottom shelf. She takes out a jar. She looks for a plate and finds half of one by the broken table. She picks it up as she hears Paul enter through the front door. 
INT. BABY SUGGS BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS. 
Sethe prepares a bed for Paul. Baby Suggs quilt is on the bed. She hesitates whether or not to leave it there. 
Paul stands by the door with his shoes in his bands, his shirt hanging open down the front. 
Sethe is surprised to see him there - she feels awkward. 
SETHE Why don't you...take a rest..I'll call you when we're ready. 
PAUL Sure you don't want me to help clean up? 
SETHE No..you'd just get in my way. Denver and me'll do it. 
They stand in silence, looking at each other for a moment. The awkwardness they both feel strike them suddenly as funny. Paul starts smiling. Sethe covers her mouth to conceal it. 
And then, just as quickly, the urge to laugh subsides - and the fear they feel takes it's place. 
Paul slowly closes the door and places his shoes on the floor. Sethe watches him. Paul crosses to her. He moves in to kiss her. They approach each other's lips like two burn victims, trying desperately not to hurt the other with their touch. 
EXT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - CONTINUOUS. 
Denver sits on the porch steps, alone once again. Miserably eating the biscuit and jelly off of a half broken plate. 
INT. BABY SUGGS BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER. 
Sethe and Paul lay in bed, after lovemaking. They are still fully clothed. The lovemaking was fast and finished quickly. Now, there is an awkwardness that is without humor or excitement - but sits like a chasm between them. 
As Sethe lays there, SHE REMEMBERS: 
MEMORY: 
EXT. THE CORN FIELDS OF SWEET HOME - A DAY REMEMBERED. 
A brilliant bright yellow and green corn stalks in a tiny corn field. 
Sethe and a slightly older HALLE - handsome, strong - run through the field until Halle stops them at an isolated spot. 
HALLE How's this? 
SETHE Here?! out in the open?! 
HALLE Look around - can you see anybody? 
Sethe looks and can see nothing through the corn stalks. She shakes her head no. 
HALLE Then nothing can see us neither. 
He takes off his shirt. Seethe giggles as she gets on the ground, keeping her ankles crossed. 
Halle lays her back and gently separates her legs. She giggles. Halle pauses before laying on top of her. 
HALLE You are a beautiful sight. 
SETHE Don't talk stupid. 
HALLE You're my wife now! I can talk as stupid as I like about you! (she giggles) I ain't never loved nothing like you before, Sethe. (Sethe is moved) And after I get mama out...then I get us out too. And you'll see, baby girl... (smiles) we're gonna have us a liiife.. 
He sings the word "life", so that Sethe laughs. Then, Halle lowers himself slowly to her and they begin to make love. As camera pans up to a HILL above the field, we hear Sethe ask; 
SETHE (O.S.) You sure nobody can see? 
We hear Halle grunt "uh-huh" as we arrive on the hill where a GREAT TREE sits. 
EXT. GREAT TREE ON THE HILL - DAY. 
Beneath the tree, PAUL D, SIXO and Paul's brothers Paul A. and Paul P. are pouring water over heads and watching; 
POV; Unbeknownst to Halle and Sethe, their lovemaking is in clear view to anyone on the hill... 
PAUL A Damn. I don't get why she picked him. 
PAUL D Halle's got that way about him. That way a woman feels he's doing it all for her, not for himself at all. 
PAUL A I can't see nothing so special about Halle. 
PAUL F What about what he's doing for his mama? 
PAUL A Fool thing, if you ask me. By the time he buys it, freedom won't mean a thing to somebody that old and worn. 
SIXO Freedom mean something anytime it come. 
The men watch the corn stalks swaying to the lovemaking. 
A YOUNG PAUL D., in particular, watches with tender yearning. 
INT. KITCHEN AT SWEET HOME - EARLY EVENING. 
MR. GARNER, the man who owns and runs Sweet Home. He offers cooked corn to the men. 
MR. GARNER Raccoon must've got into my corn. Damaged a few so, no use throwing them out... 
The men looks to each other, suppressing a laugh. 
MR. GARNER Sethe, get the butter there. 
Everyone looks at each other as they thank No. Garner and begin to smear butter on their corn and eat. 
A NEIGHBORING FARMER visiting the Garner's cautions him; 
NEIGHBORING FARMER You spoil these nigger boys. 
GARNER Maybe you got boys on your farm. My nigger's are men. Not a boy among'em. Bought 'em thataway, raised'em thataway. 
NEIGHBORING FARMER Beg to differ Garner. Ain't no nigger men. 
GARNER Not if you scared. But if you a man yourself, you'll want your niggers to be men too. 
DENVER I do. Baby Suggs told me baby ghost would never hurt me. She was my sister. When I was little, after the boys left, I used to think that she and me both were waiting for daddy to come. And once he did, she wouldn't be mad no more. (Sethe listens sadly) 
They hear Paul singing out on the porch. Denver grimaces. 
DENVER Wish he'd shut-up...He's ruined everything. 
SETHE No, he hasn't. He won't. (hesitates) He..he wants to takes us to the carnival next Thursday... 
Denver's eyes light up with excitement then caution. 
DENVER You mean, go out where they'll be other people? 
SETHE Dress up a little bit. Wear our hats. What do you think? 
DENVER (downplaying her excitement) Maybe.... 
SETHE Maybe...All right...all right. (difficult for her to say) Can I ask you something? (Denver nods, her back to Sethe) I was wondrin'..What you think about us...maybe... maybe thinking we could start...if we got an idea to, thinking we could start.. countin' on... (she stops) 
DENVER On what mama? Countin' on what? 
Sethe can barely bring herself to say. To hope. To imagine. Paul? But, for Denver, she forces herself and whispers; SETHE Something. 
EXT. CARNIVAL - DAY. 
Paul and Sethe and Denver walk among the hundreds of black townspeople gathered for the carnival. 
A sign reads COLORED THURSDAY...TWO PENNIES ENTRANCE FEE. 
Paul is in high spirits. Saying hello to anyone whose eye he catches. Willing, eager to get anything for Denver she wants. Feeling a little more like a normal van in a normal life. 
Denver is excited but worried. She doesn't want to like Paul but can't help the thrill she's feeling. And when one or two passersby shout out; 
VARIOUS PASSERS- BY Hey Denver!...Hi there Denver! 
Denver heart almost weeps with joy. 
Sethe walks cautiously. Overdressed for the occasion, it is her first outing among neighborhood folk in many years. 
She catches the eyes of some of the women she knows...ELLA and LADY JONES..good Christian women who nod in their acknowledgement yet are holding back something. A judgement? A repulsion? 
Paul doesn't notice them and for this Sethe is glad. 
MONTAGE of SCENES...the various carnival acts, all performed by a WHITE TROUPE; magic, clowning, fire swallowing, spitting ribbons, acrobats forming pyramids... 
Our trio take it all in like water to the thirsty. 
At one point, A WHITE CARNIVAL BARKER shouts to the children; 
CARNIVAL BARKER All Pickaninnies free!! 
The phrase stabs Sethe and Paul a bit. But Paul whispers; 
PAUL Two pennies and an insult well spent in my opinion to see the spectacle of whitefolks making a spectacle of themselves. 
Sethe can't help but let out a small laugh - and with that laugh, a sudden sensation of relief... 
Paul buys Denver some licorice, peppermint and lemonade. Holding the lemonade for her, Paul asks; 
PAUL Mind if I take a sip? 
Denver agrees. Paul takes some lemonade then wipes the rim where he sipped with a small napkin and gently hands it back to her. Denver, in spite of herself, is starting to like him. 
END MONTAGE. 
EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY. 
Our trio are leaving the carnival, walking three astride with distance in between each. The sunlight casts strong shadows. 
Sethe's eyes glance towards the ground behind them and sees; 
THEIR THREE SHADOWS ARE HOLDING HANDS.....as they walk home. 
FADE OUT; 
FADE- IN. 
EXT. A STREAM AND THE BANK BESIDE IT - DAY. 
WIDE ANGLE of a BEAUTIFUL, WIDE STREAM (more like a small river) with a MULBERRY TREE standing tall on the bank before it. There is not a soul in sight as the stream moves gracefully beneath the sun. 
SUDDENLY; 
A FULLY DRESSED YOUNG BLACK WOMAN EMERGES FROM THE MIDDLE OF THE STREAM LIKE A GODDESS ARISING OUT OF SPIRITUAL WATERS... SHE WEARS A STRAW HATT A WHITE DRESS WITH BUTTONS, A LACE COLLAR AND NEW SHOES. SHE WALKS OUT OF THE WATER TO THE BANK. 
Exhausted, sopping wet and breathing heavily as if from asthma, she sits, leaning against the mulberry tree. She seems too tired to even hold her head upon her neck. Yet her skin is like new lineless and smooth. Glowing. 
Although racked with pain, SHE IS SMILING. Smiling the way travellers smile when they have finally arrived after a long and arduous journey. 
EXT. WOODS - DAY. 
The Young Black Woman makes her way through the woods. She passes by Denver's BOXWOOD BUSH secret place. Then continues forward, as if with a specific direction in mind. 
EXT. 124 BLUESTONE ROAD - LATE AFTERNOON. 
Sethe, Paul and Denver approach 124. Denver is the first to see. 
DENVER Look. What is that? 
All three look to see; 
THE YOUNG BLACK WOMAN sitting on a stump not far from the steps of 124. 
As the three approach, the Young Woman lifts her head and stares directly at Sethe. 
The two women exchange a moment in their eyes - Sethe, curious yet warm...The Young Woman, happy yet there is a hunger in her stare. 
INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER. 
The Young Woman seated on a chair as Denver refills a tin cup of water. The Young Woman drinks greedily, cup after cup. 
SETHE You from around here? 
The Young Woman shakes her head NO. She reaches down and takes off her shoes, which Sethe notices as new. Sethe bends down to pick them up. The Young Woman never lets her eyes leave Sethe. 
PAUL Those shoes look brand new. 
Paul doesn't want her to continue but doesn't want to say so. 
PAUL Any more beans? 
Sethe rises to get him more food and she continues: 
SETHE ...anyway, she points to this mark and says to me "This is your ma'am. I am the only one whose got this mark now. The rest all dead. If something happens to me and you can't tell me by my face, you can know me by this mark"..Scared me so... I couldn't think of anything to say so I said "Yes Ma'am..but how will you know us? Mark me too. Mark the mark on me too." 
DENVER Did she? 
SETHE No. She slapped my face. I didn't understand it then. Not until I had a mark of my own... 
Paul is disturbed. He can see Sethe getting upset. He is mad at Beloved for her damn questions.. 
BELOVED What happened to her? 
Something inside of Sethe stops, a wall erected. Something unwanted is coming into her consciousness. Paul notices it. She rises; 
SETHE Don't know. Everybody done? 
Sethe collects a few dishes and crosses to the sink as Paul asks: 
PAUL Well, as long as we're all asking questions, getting to know each other.. (to Beloved) Why don't you tell us a little bit about yourself? 
Camera follows Sethe as she arrives at the sink, placing the dish inside. We hear the others O.S.: 
DENVER (O.S.) (defensively) She don't remember nothing. 
PAUL (O.S.) You be surprised what you start remembering once you start talking. 
BELOVED (O.S.) Can I have some more pudding? 
Camera stays on Sethe as we drown out the voices at the kitchen table. She is staring out the window above the sink as if watching the MEMORY BEING RELIVED IN HER YARD; 
POV - OUT THE WINDOW; 
MEMORY: 
EXT. A LARGE TREE IN A FIELD - A DAY REMEMBERED. 
A CROWD of people surround a tree. SEVERAL WHITE MEN are preparing to hang a group of black men and women standing in line, awaiting their turn. 
Among the crowd is A CHILD (SETHE) holding the hand of an OLDER BLACK SLAVE WOMAN (NAN). Nan is pointing to a WOMAN (SETHE'S MOTHER), who is one of the people waiting in line to be hanged. Nan whispers to Sethe: 
NAN That's your mama - right there. 
Little Sethe looks up and sees her mother - her face a mask of courage and rage and tears. She looks straight ahead - not at anyone in particular, especially not her daughter. 
NAN ..I'm telling you, small girl Sethe...Me and your Mama was taken by the men many times..She threw them other babies away..the others from the whites, without names, she threw them away..But you she gave the name of the black man. She had her arms around him, child. The others, she did not put her arms around. Never...Never... 
The child Sethe listens, watching her mother move further down the line. 
END of MEMORY as WE CUT BACK TO: 
INT. KITCHEN - 
Sethe, the memory passing, hears the voices in her kitchen: 
PAUL (O.S.) Ain't you got no brothers or sisters? 
BELOVED (O.S.) I don't have nobody. 
She finds Paul interrogating Beloved who eats a second pudding. Denver tries to interfere. 
DENVER She has us now! 
PAUL You been here five weeks, we still don't know nothing bout you.. 
SETHE Paul, Stop it. Denver bring those dishes. 
PAUL What was you looking for when you came here? 
BELOVED This place. I was looking for this place I could be in. 
PAUL Somebody tell you about this place? 
At the sink, both Sethe and Denver pause, obviously interested. 
BELOVED She told me. When I was at the bridge, she told me. 
Paul looks quizzically at Sethe, who shrugs; 
SETHE Must be somebody from the old days. 
PAUL How'd you come? Who brought you? 
BELOVED I walked here. A long, long, long, long way. Nobody bring me. 
PAUL You had new shoes. If you walked so long why don't your shoes show it? 
SETHE Paul D. stop picking on her. 
PAUL I want to know! Where'd you get them shoes and that dress you had on? 
BELOVED I take the shoes! (coughs) I take the dress! (coughs) The shoe strings don't fit! I... 
Suddenly, she begins to CHOKE on a raisin from the pudding and falls backward, off the chair. 
Denver and Sethe rush towards her. Beloved thrashes around until they help her turn over and spit up the raisin. 
She breathes in Sethe's arms as Denver wipes up the mess, glaring at Paul. 
SETHE You all right? 
BELOVED (whispers) I want to go to sleep now. 
DENVER Come to my room. I can watch out for you up there. 
Sethe gets Beloved to her feet. Denver takes her up the staircase to her room - glaring at Paul. 
When the girls have gone, Sethe turns on Paul as she cleans up. 
SETHE What's the matter with you? 
PAUL I don't understand what the hold is. It's clear why she holds onto you, but I just can't see why you holding on to her. 
AMY What you gonna do, just lay there and foal? 
SETHE I can't get up. 
AMY What? 
SETHE I can't get up. 
Amy wipes her nose and looks up beyond Sethe. 
AMY There's a house back yonder. Well, not a house with people in it - more like a lean-to near the river. 
SETHE How far? 
AMY Make a difference, does it? You stay here, snake might get you. 
SETHE Well, he may come but I can't stand up, let alone walk...and God help me, I can't crawl. 
AMY Sure you can Lu..come on.. 
Amy helps Sethe turn over onto all fours. 
EXT. ONION FIELD - DAY...MINUTES LATER. 
Amy walks beside Sethe as the latter painfully crawls, taking moments to stop and let the pain go through her. 
AMY Come on Lu! You got to move faster than that. You won't get to Ohio til you ninety years old, you keep moving that ways. 
INT. LEAN-TO - EARLY EVENING. 
Amy makes a pile of leaves for Sethe to lay on and some rocks for her to put up her feet. She talks non-stop as she works. 
AMY Never know it to look at me but I used to be a good size. Nice arms, everything. That was before they put me in the root cellar... 
She eases Sethe onto the leaves then lifts her feet onto the rocks. 
AMY ...Mama worked for these people here to pay for her passage but then she had me and died right after so I had to work for'em.. I was fishing off the Beaver once and a nigger floated right by me. I don't like drowned people, do you? Your feet remind me of him. All swole like. 
Amy props Sethe up from behind when she notices 
AMY You all bloody back here. Gal you a mess. Undo your dress - let me see. 
Sethe makes a tremendous effort just to turn to her side as Amy undoes her dress; 
AMY Lord, I ain't never seen a poorer excuse for a- 
Amy sees Sethe's back and, for a moment, is speechless. Then: 
AMY Jesus...It's a tree Lu..A chokecherry tree. I had me some whippings but I don't remember nothing like this. Glad I ain't you.. what God have in mind I wonder. ...You thank your Maker I come along. Spiderwebs all I can do for you. What's in here ain't enough. I'll look outside...Maybe I ought to break them blossoms open and let the pus run.. (rises) (smiles) That you ain't dead yet Lu's a miracle. Make you a bet..You make it through the night, you make it all the way... 
INT. LEAN-TO - NIGHT. 
To Sethe's amazement, Amy begins to massage her feet and legs the pain of which causes Sethe to cry. 
AMY It's gonna hurt now..Anything dead coming back to life hurts. Stop wiggling, girl. (sings) "WHEN THE BUSY DAY IS DONE AND MY WEARY LITTLE ONE ROCKETH TO AND FRO; WHEN THE NIGHT WINDS SOFTLY BLOW AND CRICKETS CHIRP AGAIN; WHERE'PON THE HAUNTED GREEN FAIRIES DANCE AROUND THEIR QUEEN THEN FROM YONDER MISTY SKIES COMETH LADY BUTTON EYES..." (talks) Don't up and die on me in the night, you hear me Lu? I don't want to see your ugly face hankering over me. If you do die, just go on off somewhere where I can't see you, hear? 
SETHE I'll do what I can, miss. 
Amy continues singing..... 
EXT. PATH LEADING TO RIVER - DAY. 
Sethe is trying to walk, holding on to Amy at first, then a tree. 
AMY Cause of me, you up and walking. See, Jesus - Lu made it through..I'm good at sick things, ain't I? 
SETHE Yeah, you good... 
AMY What's that all over your dress? 
SETHE Milk..Got to get my milk to my baby girl. 
AMY You got another baby waiting for you? 
SETHE (stops and touches belly) I think this one is dead. 
Amy doesn't know what to say, so she says: 
AMY You hungry? 
Sethe keeps trying to walk; 
SETHE I ain't nothing but in a hurry, miss. Got to meet someone...help bring me and my milk to my baby girl... 
AMY You want shoes? 
SETHE Say what? 
AMY I figured how... 
CUT TO: 
Amy cutting two pieces form Sethe shawl then filling them with leaves and tying them over her feet - 
CUT TO: 
EXT. RIVERBANK - DAY. 
Sethe and Amy walk towards the river when then see: 
A SMALL, ABANDONED ROWBOAT with oars. 
AMY Jesus looking at you, girl! 
Sethe can't believe her eyes. She walks right into the water when suddenly, her own water breaks and her labor begins... She doubles up in pain; 
AMY What you doing that for!? Ain't you got a brain in your head? Stop that right now! I said stop it, Lu. You the dumbest thing on this here earth, LU!..LU! 
Sethe, on her knees, crawls into the boat and props her feet up. Water leaks in wherever it can, rising up as high as her waist. Amy takes her position to assist. 
AMY Oh Jesus, I'm awful sorry 'bout the braggin...I need you here now..Come on Jesus...don't be getting lost on me now. 
Sethe screams in agony as the child pushes through. Amy curses; 
AMY Damn daddies never around 'cept for the fun part. Biggest joke God made on woman was giving men the planters 'stead of the soil...!! PUSH! 
Baby Suggs welcomes Sethe into the house, kissing her hard on the lips....Sethe can't believe she's in her arms. 
BABY SUGGS Where's Halle? 
Sethe looks at her with confusion and exhaustion. 
SETHE He wasn't there. 
A flash of fear is quickly transformed into pragmatism. 
BABY SUGGS Well, he be along presently, I'm sure. 
SETHE Where are the children? 
BABY SUGGS Not now. You too ugly looking to wake 'em up in the night. First we get you well.. 
INT. KEEPING ROOM - NIGHT. 
Baby Suggs bathes Sethe - first her face, her body...hands, arms, legs... 
When she gets to her unrecognizable feet, she touches them. 
BABY SUGGS You feel this? 
SETHE Feel what? 
BABY SUGGS Nothing.. 
Baby Suggs notices roses of blood on Sethe's back...She looks and covers her mouth when she sees the remnants of the whipping. 
BABY SUGGS Girl... 
INT. KEEPING ROOM - LATER THAT DAY. 
Baby Suggs with two other grown women attend to Sethe's back - greasing it and pinning double thicknesses of cloth to the inside of a newly stitched dress... 
INT. KEEPING ROOM - STILL LATER THAT DAY. 
Sethe, sitting in bed with her new dress and her wounds dressed waits for her children. 
Baby Suggs opens the door and the boys are ushered in. Sethe welcomes them to her arms...They run to her, jumping on the bed. The startle causes some pain but Sethe doesn't care. 
The Little Girl (Beloved) is crawling and ushered toward her mama. 
BABY SUGGS Already crawling - ain't that somethin? ..Come on, baby girl..right this way..Mama's waiting.. 
Sethe picks her up and the tears flow. She can't stop kissing them - their necks, their heads, their hands...The Boys inspect her strange looking feet and ask; 
HOWARD Pappie come? 
SETHE Soon. 
Baby Suggs seems doubtful but appreciates the lie for the children. 
BABY SUGGS All right boys - mama's home now, you be seeing her all the time..Go downstairs and get your supper...Go on... 
Sethe hugs and kisses them as if for the last time - as if she still doesn't believe she can just get out of bed, walk downstairs and be with them. The Boys leave as Sethe cradles the Little Girl. 
Sethe anxiously undoes her dress and carefully guides her breast to the Little Girl. She winces with pain and smiles - she got her milk to her baby girl. 
Baby Suggs gathers the rags Sethe wore when she first arrived. 
BABY SUGGS Nothing worth saving here. 
SETHE Oh wait..Look and see if there's something knotted up in the petticoat. Wedding present. From Mrs. Garner. 
Baby Suggs finds TWO CRYSTAL EARRINGS. 
BABY SUGGS Be nice if there was a groom to go with it. What do you think happened to him? 
SETHE I don't know. He wasn't where he said to meet him at. I had to get out. I had to. He'll make it. if I made it, Halle sure can. 
BABY SUGGS (skeptical) Well put these on - maybe they'll light his way. 
As Sethe takes the earrings, the Little Baby Girl reaches for them. 
Through her eyes, we see them sparkle and shine - like diamonds. 
Baby Suggs hands gently massage Sethe's neck as she says; 
BABY SUGGS Whatever happens now...God lead you home. So now lay'em down Sethe...Sword and shield..Don't study war no more. Lay all that mess down. Sword and shield... 
Sethe surrenders herself to Baby Suggs firm, safe hands - letting go of the "diamonds", one of which lands in the hands of the Little Girl...who plays with them in fascination... 
END OF MEMORY. 
CUT BACK TO: 
PRESENT DAY; 
EXT. A CLEARING IN THE WOODS - DAY 
Sethe is remembering these last images, she eases her own hand up to her neck - rubbing herself the way Baby Suggs did. She realizes how much she misses her...and wonder who can touch her now and help her "lay it all down". And then, quite suddenly; 
AN IMAGE FLASHES ACROSS HER MIND; 
- PAUL GENTLY EASING HIS HANDS AROUND SETHE FROM BEHIND...TENDERLY KISSING SETHE'S BACK 
Paul...There is Paul. Sethe realizes, as IMAGES FLASH ACROSS HER MIND'S EYE: 
- PAUL SITTING ON THE PORCH THE FIRST DAY HE ARRIVED. 
- PAUL BATTLING THE BABY GHOST. 
- PAUL SINGING AS HE FIXES THE KITCHEN TABLE. 
- SETHE WRAPPED IN PAUL'S BIG ARMS AS THEY LAY IN BED. 
Sethe rises from the ground, as if with a new realization. She begins to walk out of the clearing and into the woods, her pace increasing with each image.... 
EXT. WOODS - DAY. 
Sethe walks through the woods, passing Beloved unawares - who has fallen asleep by a tree. Beloved is awakened as Sethe walks by, and gets to her feet to follow. 
Further on, Sethe passes a sleeping Denver, who also awakens upon hearing the footsteps of her mother, followed by Beloved. Sethe walks on, unaware of them following her. 
WHITE GUARD (OS) YOU HUNGRY NIGGER? 
Paul awakens. 
INT. KITCHEN - DAWN. 
Sethe enters to find Paul asleep in the rocker by the stove. She stirs him. 
SETHE Paul?..Paul? 
PAUL (waking up) Mmmm. What?... 
SETHE I called you two or three times but I gave up round midnight. I thought maybe you went out somewhere. 
PAUL Damn. I'm sorry honey... 
SETHE I'll make some breakfast - you get yourself washed up. 
Sethe begins to make breakfast as Beloved enters the kitchen and sees Paul has slept in the rocker. She looks at him with a smile, as if she knows more than she's letting on. Paul registers the look. 
INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT. 
Paul is asleep in the rocker...He is restless...HE DREAMS: 
EXT. A ROAD IN VIRGINIA - DAY. 
Paul is chained by the ankles to forty-five other men. He hands are shackled. In his mouth, an iron bit... 
The men are being led by WHITE GUARDS with rifles. 
Camera follows them under a burning sun as they approach; 
A TRENCH. One thousand feet long. Five feet deep. Five feet wide. 
Camera tilts down to reveal, within the trench; 
WOODEN BOXES, with scrap limber roofs and a door of bars fitted on them like a cage that opens up to a wall of red dirt stretching two feet above the top of the bars themselves. 
INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT. 
Paul awakens...his face and body drenched in sweat. 
EXT. FIELD BETWEEN 124 AND THE STOREROOM - NIGHT. 
Paul D. walks across the field with a thin blanket over his nightclothes - walking toward the storeroom. 
In the window of her bedroom, Sethe watches him - sensing he is moving further and further away from her. 
In the window of Denver's room, Beloved watches Paul as well - with a pleased expression. 
CUT TO: 
PAUL'S MEMORIES; 
EXT. A FIELD IN GEORGIA - DAY. 
A RIFLE SHOT. A WHITE GUARD SHOUTS; 
WHITE GUARD Hiiiiiii! 
EXT. TRENCH - DAY. 
Three white Men walk along the trench unlocking the cage doors one by one... 
One by one, the Black men emerge and stand in a line in the trench. 
When all are assembled, A SECOND RIFLE SHOT signals them to climb out of the trench to the ground above. 
Waiting for them above the trench, is one thousand feet of chain. Each Black Man bends over and waits as the First Man on line threads the chain through his leg iron, passing it to the second and so on... 
As they connect each other to the chain, Camera Pans down the line of men and while not a word is spoken, WE HEAR THEIR THOUGHTS...thoughts to themselves, or, if possible, through their eyes to the man beside them: 
BLACK MAN ONE (VO) I'm a make it.. 
BLACK MAN TWO (VO) New man. New man... 
BLACK MAN THREE (VO) Steady now, steady. 
BLACK MAN FOUR (VO) Help me... this mornin's bad. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
THE BLACK MEN ARE CHAINED AND KNEELING IN A STRAIGHT LINE. 
The White Guards walk passed them. one White Guard stops in front of the man beside Paul D. He turns to him. 
WHITE GUARD Breakfast? Want some breakfast nigger? 
BLACK MAN ONE Yes sir. 
WHITE GUARD Hungry nigger? 
BLACK MAN ONE Yes sir. 
WHITE GUARD Here you go. 
The White Guard unzips his fly and undoes his pants and moves a step closer to the Black Man's mouth. 
Paul D. looks ahead, trembling...He vomits...The Guard steps away as another Guard steps in and hits Paul on the shoulder with a rifle.. 
EXT. FIELD - DAY. 
The Black Men work...sledge hammers in hand... 
As they work, miraculously, THEY SING.."They sing about the women they knew, the children they had been...they sing of bosses and masters and misses...of mules and dogs and the shamelessness of life...They sing of sisters long gone. They sing love songs to Death." 
INT. TRENCH - NIGHT. 
A torrential downpour. The men in the wooden cages watch the rain filling the trench, corroding the red dirt wall around them. 
Bugs and human debris swirl around their legs and feet. Mud covering them through the cracks of the scrap lumber roof. 
Some finds rest. other's minds are long gone. 
Camera finds Paul...HE IS SCREAMING. But there is no sound coming from his mouth. Tears flow down his face, but when he touches them, he realizes; 
SETHE Well say it, Paul D...whether I like it or not. 
Paul knows what she's expecting. And when he sees her diminished expectation, the melancholy without blame in her eyes....he can't tell her about Beloved. He is filled with respect and admiration for her in that moment. Something pops into his head and out of his mouth that wasn't planned; 
PAUL I want you pregnant, Sethe. Would you do that for me? 
Sethe breaks up with laughter. Paul joins in. 
SETHE You came by here to ask me that!? You are one crazy-headed man. You right; I don't like it!...Don't you think I'm a little too old to start that all over again? 
She slips her fingers into his. 
PAUL Think about it. 
Paul lifts them, putting the tips of her fingers on his cheek. He smiles broadly; 
She laughs, shaking her head. A burden transformed into a gift, so suddenly. They begin walking. 
Sethe and Paul catch and snatch each other's fingers, stealing quick pats on the behind, joyfully. Paul throws his arm around Sethe and squeezes. She lets her head touch his chest. They stop and stay that way for a moment - not breathing. Sethe closes her eyes. Paul looks up to the trees lining the roadside like defending arms against attack. Softly, suddenly, it begins to snow. Sethe opens her eyes: 
SETHE Mercy. 
EXT. BLUESTONE ROAD - EARLY EVENING. 
On the road towards 124, Paul and Sethe run hand in hand. Snow falling all around them. 
SETHE I been on my feet all day, Paul D. 
PAUL Where I been? Sitting down!? 
SETHE Stop! I don't have the legs for this! 
They slow to a walk. 
PAUL Then give'em to me. 
Before she can stop him, Paul hoists Sethe up over his shoulders. 
SETHE You need some babies..somebody to play with in the snow. 
PAUL I sure would like to give it a try. Need a willing partner though. 
SETHE I'll say..Very, very willing. 
They continue laughing and moving down Bluestone Road when they are jolted by the appearance of; 
Beloved. Waiting in her usual place for Sethe. Her hands wrapped in a long shawl, waiting to be given to Sethe. Her eyes only on Sethe, not even acknowledging Paul's presence. 
Sethe gets herself down from Paul. 
SETHE Crazy girl. You out here with nothing on. 
She takes the shawl from Beloved's hands and wraps it around her shoulders. 
SETHE You got to learn more sense than that. 
She walks on ahead with Beloved. Paul, suddenly icy cold and filled with anger, walks behind. 
EXT. 124 BLUESTONE ROAD - NIGHT. 
Denver waits on the porch. Sethe and Beloved walk by her. 
SETHE Evening, girl. 
Sethe and Beloved enter the house. As Paul approaches, he stops before Denver. Their eyes meet. Paul stares at her, as if to ask - "Who's ally are you?"...Denver, unnerved by his look, runs into the house. Paul waits on the porch until, a moment later, Sethe re-appears. 
SETHE Now I know you not sleeping out there tonight, are you Paul D.? (Paul doesn't reply) You come upstairs tonight. Where you belong...and stay there. 
As if healed by her strength, Paul's face melts into relief. 
INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT. 
Denver is cleaning the dishes. Beloved sits like an angry, upset five year old with her fingers in her mouth. 
BELOVED She likes him here... (to Denver) Make him go away. 
DENVER She'd be mad if he leaves. 
Beloved didn't consider that. Her fingers move violently in her mouth as if something were bothering her...until, finally, she pulls out a back tooth...her lips slightly bloody. 
DENVER OOoo..didn't that hurt you? 
BELOVED It's like my dreams...I get two dreams, see..One, I exploding...BUUOOGGG...The other I being swallowed. Sometimes it's hard to keep my head on my neck, or these legs connected to my hips...One day I think I might wake up and I'll be in pieces.. (Looks at tooth) Maybe it's starting. 
DENVER (cleans Beloved's mouth) Oh stop. It's just a tooth. Probably wisdom. Does it hurt? 
BELOVED Yes. 
DENVER Then why don't you cry? 
BELOVED What? 
DENVER If it hurts, why don't you cry? 
Beloved, eases herself into Denver's arms, and cries... 
EXT. WINDOW OF 124 - NIGHT. 
We see Sethe and Paul united as the snow begins to pile up. 
INT. SETHE'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT. 
Sethe lies with Paul, in the dark, her face looking up to the ceiling. Paul is asleep. 
On her face are reservations. She rises, crossing to the window to look out. 
At the same time, Beloved appears silently at the doorway of the room, looking at Sethe - hurt and sad. She walks by without Sethe noticing her. 
Sethe takes a breath at the window, watching the snow fall. Then, as she moves back to the bed,... 
Camera moves ahead of her to: 
A DIFFERENT BED IN WHICH HALLE IS TRYING TO FALL ASLEEP. A YOUNGER SETHE CRAWLS IN BESIDE HIM. 
WE ARE IN MEMORY; 
She notices Mrs. Garner's light is on in her bedroom window. 
Sethe, blind with rage, decides there's one thing she must do before she takes her children to the meeting place. 
INT. MRS. GARNER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT. 
Mrs. Garner lies ailing through a sleepless night when her bedroom door opens. Sethe enters - her appearance tells all. 
MRS. GARNER My God Sethe..what happened to you? 
EXT. SWEET HOME - NIGHT. 
Sethe carried her baby girl in one arm, her two boys by the hand with the other...They move as fast as they can. 
EXT. CORN FIELD - NIGHT. 
They arrive at the meeting place where A WOMAN crouching in the field is waiting. 
WOMAN Hurry up. You're late. 
SETHE (hands her the children) Here! 
HOWARD But ma'am... 
SETHE Just go with her! Do what I tell ya! 
Sethe carefully hands her baby girl to the woman. 
SETHE Put sugar water on that cloth for her to suck so she won't forget me til I come. 
WOMAN Where you going? 
SETHE Halle wasn't there. I gotta go back. 
WOMAN You crazy.. 
SETHE Take em out. Now! I'll get there myself. I got her milk...I'll get there...Don't worry. 
She kisses her baby girl, a little too hard perhaps, waking her...along with the boys... 
SETHE Go..Go! Now! 
Sethe disappears back into the corn field leaving the Woman holding the baby girl... as Bulgar cries out. 
BULGAR Mama? 
EXT. CORN FIELD CLOSER TO SWEET HOME HOUSE - NIGHT. 
Sethe exits the corn field and heads for her living quarters when suddenly; 
THE FOUR BOYS appears from out of nowhere..two restraining her, one holding a horsewhip.... 
BOY WITH HORSEWHIP You nigger bastard.. 
Sethe struggles and is about to scream out when she is slapped and muffled and dragged into the corn field to be beaten..... 
END OF MEMORY; 
INT. SETHE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT. 
Sethe awakens, sweating from having fallen asleep and reliving her past nightmare. She sits up and realizes where she is. She looks beside her and sees Paul asleep. She lays down, pressing her body against his so that there is no space between - enfolding her arms around him. 
EXT. PIG SLAUGHTERHOUSE - DAY. 
Pigs are crying in the chute as Paul, Stamp Paid and twenty other workers push and prod them towards the slaughterhouse. 
Although steeped in pig shit on a wintry day - his hands numb from the cold - Paul D. is in high spirits. HE SINGS as he works much to the amusement of his fellow co-workers. 
CO-WORKER 1 Hey - you like this work so much maybe you best get in the chute with the others. You ain't got much more sense than they do. 
The men laugh. Paul smiles and brushes it off. 
PAUL Ain't just a job reason to sing. Other things a man's got to look forward to that a job just a way to spend your day til the good times arrive. 
CO-WORKER 2 Good times? Ain't no such day. 
STAMP PAID Now, now...it's all a state a mind, right Paul D. If you can think it, it can happen. 
PAUL More than that. When a man can make plans then a man can make good times happen. 
CO-WORKER 1 Oh the man's got plans! You saving up for a gold mine, boy. (more laughter) 
PAUL Better then gold, my friend. Me and my woman's planning on starting a family. 
Stamp Paid's face registers sudden concern. 
PAUL New life. Born free, hear! Now if that don't define a good tine, I don't know what does. 
CO-WORKER 2 Nothing born free ever again. 
PAUL What you talkin? Nobody owns us no more. Nobody gonna own my children neither. 
CO-WORKER 2 Children inherit what come before'em. Just cause you can't see no chains, don't mean they not there. We're not free men. We're somewhere between freedom and chains. And as long as the world is white, that's where we're stayin. 
The truth of this causes the men to be silent as they continue working. Stamp Paid looks at Paul, confused by what he should do. 
EXT. PIG SLAUGHTERHOUSE - LATER THAT DAY. 
The men are on break. Paul sits alone enjoying a lunch packed by Sethe...Stamp Paid approaches and sits beside him. 
STAMP PAID May I? 
PAUL Free country. No matter what anybody says. 
STAMP PAID I like the way you think, boy. Good. Good to think that way. Friend of mine, Baby Suggs was her name...sort of became a preacher in these parts..that was her way of thinking too. When she was at her best, that is. 
PAUL You knew Baby Suggs? 
STAMP PAID Oh yes...You're not one of her Sweet Home men, now are you? 
PAUL Yes sir...Me and my brothers and her son. 
STAMP PAID Oh, I see now. 
PAUL Sethe told me she died soft as cream. 
EXT. CLEARING IN THE WOODS - DAY. 
As folks gather to hear Baby Suggs preach, she introduces a smiling, shy Sethe to each one. 
SETHE (VO) ...And when everyone would gather to hear Baby Suggs, I saw something I ain't never seen before in my whole life... 
Alone for a moment, Sethe looks around at the crowd of faces; 
Sethe's Melody stops as Baby Suggs stands on her rock and calls to the crowd: 
BABY SUGGS Let the children come! 
FROM OUT OF THE WOODS, CHILDREN RUN INTO THE CLEARING. 
Camera follows the joyous exodus to reveal: 
THE CLEARING IS FILLED WITH ADULTS the entire black community of the days when Sethe first arrived. The children run to their respective families; 
BABY SUGGS (with joy) Let your mother's hear you laugh!! 
The children, loving the game, laugh hard. The adults get a kick out of it. 
Sethe watches her boys and hides her laughter. 
BABY SUGGS Let the grown men come!! 
OUT OF THE WOODS, A GROUP OF GROWN MEN COME INTO THE CLEARING. 
BABY SUGGS LET YOUR WIVES AND YOUR CHILDREN SEE YOU DANCE! 
The men form a circle and dance as the crowd supports them with a clapping rhythm. A SONG arises from the women to accompany to dance.... 
BABY SUGGS Now...you women...I want you to cry. For the living. For the dead....Just cry. 
Camera follows those women who are not singing as one by one, they remember and weep... 
Sethe watches...and weeps. 
SETHE ....Something in me knew Halle was never gonna knock on our door. He was never gonna see what I saw that day. I saw what men look like...and I saw mothers, for the first time. 
EXT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - DAY. 
Stamp Paid walks up to the porch carrying a TWO BIG BASKETS OF BLACKBERRIES ... his body dirty, scratched and bleeding. 
SETHE (VO) I think it was Stamp Paid who started it. He walked six miles to the riverbank, slid into a ravine, reached through blood drawing thorns, suffered mosquitoes, wasps and the meanest lady spiders in the State just to bring us those berries. 
He places the baskets on the porch in front of Baby Suggs, Sethe who is holding Denver..and the Little Girl (Beloved). 
BABY SUGGS (laughs) What a sight you are, Stamp. 
STAMP PAID Worth it though. Just one bite of these berries and you feel down right anointed. 
He puts one into Denver's mouth. 
SETHE She's too little for that, Stamp. Her bowels be soup. 
BABY SUGGS It'll sickify her stomach..Now go wash up round back...crazy fool.. 
Stamp exits. 
SETHE It was real nice of him. 
BABY SUGGS He's a good one, no doubt of that. I can get three, maybe four pies out of this. Seems a shame just for us though. I'm gonna invite Ella and John over... 
SETHE How 'bout if I make a couple of chickens to back it up? 
SETHE (VO) And that's how it began... 
INT. KITCHEN - DAY. 
Sethe and Baby Suggs and Ella and several other women cook. 
SETHE (VO) ...Three pies became twelve...two hens became five turkeys... 
EXT.THE FIELD/124 BLUESTONE RD. - EVENING. 
Various images of people gathered enjoying food and drink...laughing and singing... 
SETHE (VO) ...and Ella and John turned into almost ninety others... 
- Women serving up the food... 
- Older men sitting and talking as they eat... 
- Younger men playing with the children. Chasing them with sheets on their backs, scaring them into laughter.. 
- A Man with a guitar playing a blues song and singing. 
While Sethe enjoys her free life and, most of all, her children - the boys running around her..Denver in her arms..Her Little Girl (Beloved) by her side.. Baby Sugg's visits with various guests, serving up the food... 
SETHE (VO) ... Everybody ate so well and laughed so much... 
INTERCUT; Images of whispers exchanged between some of the women: 
SETHE (VO) ...it made them angry... 
Women head to head with a remark or an eye of disapproval towards Baby Suggs as she continues cooking and feeding.... 
SETHE (VO) The pies, the turkeys...the bread pudding and shortbread..the one whole block of ice brought all the way from Cincinnati - it made 'em mad...Loaves and fishes were Jesus's powers...they did not belong to an ex-slave who never had a white boy beat her, who had her freedom bought, who rented a house from white folks that hated slavery worse than they hated slaves...It made'em furious - her thoughtless generosity and un-called for pride...She had over stepped...offended them by giving too much...and they left their disapproval there so's you could smell in the air the whole next day... 
EXT. THE FIELD/ 124 BLUESTONE RD. - THE FOLLOWING DAY. 
Baby Suggs works the field, not far from Stamp Paid... 
SETHE (VO) Later on I wondered why no one warned us...why no one saw them coming and ran to 124 to tell us... 
She chops at the soil over the roots of the pepper plants. She stops - sensing something is wrong. She looks up at a clear blue sky...She hears the birds and the stream way down beyond the woods.. 
She looks around and sees Bulgar, Howard and the Little Girl (Beloved) playing with loud voices by the side of the house. 
She sees Sethe squatted in the pole beans with Denver in a bushel basket beside her. 
The clok, clok of wood being chopped causes her to look over to Stamp Paid, helping out with the axe... 
She returns to her work...but something is deeply wrong. 
Outside, a throng of black faces have gathered who stop murmuring the second they see her. Among them are Ella and Lady Jones. They are shocked and pained. 
Sethe is led past them to a waiting cart - in total silence. 
Baby Suggs, at the same time, is getting the boys up the porch into the house. When Denver cries in Stamp Paid's arms, she stops..lets the boys sit and runs towards the cart. 
Sethe is seated in the cart beside the Sheriff. Baby Suggs takes the crying Denver from Stamp Paid..She tells the Sheriff. 
BABY SUGGS Excuse me..but the child needs nursin..needs the mother's milk.. 
SHERIFF Then she's best come too. 
Baby Suggs approaches Sethe who sees Denver crying and reaches for her without letting the baby go. Baby Suggs resists; 
BABY SUGGS One at a time!...And you gotta clean yourself up! 
But Sethe only wants her living child. The two women struggle as Stamp Paid does what he can..Finally, Sethe wins and takes Denver with her free hand, undoes her dress and nurse's her with a bloody breast.. 
Baby Suggs breaks inside. Breaks right in two, although from outwards appearances, she looks merely numbed by shock. 
A WHITE BOY makes his way through the crowd with a pair of shoes and hands them to her.. 
WHITE BOY Mama says Wednesday. She says you got to have them fixed by Wednesday. 
Baby Suggs looks at him not understanding.. 
WHITE BOY You hear, Baby? She says Wednesday. 
BABY SUGGS (taking the shoes) I beg your pardon..Lord, I beg your pardon..I sure do.... 
CUT TO: 
PRESENT DAY (END OF MEMORY) : 
INT. 124 BLUESTONE ROAD - NIGHT. 
Paul D. sits at the kitchen table. The story told. Sethe looks out the window...and waits.. 
PAUL Your love is too thick, Sethe. 
SETHE Love is or it isn't. Thin love ain't love at all...I did stop him. I took and put my babies where they'd be safe... 
PAUL Didn't work though, did it? 
SETHE It worked. 
PAUL How? Your boys gone, you don't know where. One girl dead, the other can't go farther than the yard. How did it work? 
SETHE They ain't at Sweet Home! Schoolteacher ain't got'em! 
PAUL Maybe there's worse. 
SETHE It ain't my job to know what's worse. It's my job to know what is and keep them away from what I know is terrible. I did that. 
PAUL What you did was wrong, Sethe. 
SETHE I should have gone back there? Taken my babies back there? 
PAUL There could have been a way. Some other way. 
SETHE What way? 
PAUL You got two feet, Sethe. Not four! 
That jumped out before he had a chance to choose saying it. Sethe has no response...The distance between these two people in this small room is suddenly vast. 
Paul rises, playing with his hat...not knowing how to leave. But desperately needing to. He moves to the exit and stops.. 
PAUL You can set aside supper for me... Might be late getting back... 
Unable to look at her, he turns to exit. When Sethe speaks in a soft, forgiving tone, he stops to listen; 
SETHE After all I told you, Paul D. and after telling me how many feet I have, you think saying goodbye is gonna break me into pieces? 
Paul turns to look at her and realizes she saw right through him... 
SETHE You're a sweet man. 
Unable to bear it, Paul turns and leaves... 
Sethe stands still, fighting tears, and whispers... 
SETHE So long, Paul D. 
INT. KITCHEN - DAY. 
Sethe is scrubbing the floor, with Denver trailing by with dry rags. 
Beloved enters holding a pair of ice skates; 
BELOVED What do these do? 
Sethe and Beloved look up. Sethe smiles; 
SETHE My Lord...where'd you dig up those? 
DENVER There for skating on the ice. We have another pair and half of another, I think. 
BELOVED Can we try them? 
Sethe takes the skates and looks at them with a curious lightness: 
SETHE Go ice skating? Ha... (beat) Why not? 
DENVER You sure mama? 
SETHE Strikes me that after your man leaves, it might just be the wrong time to be scrubbing floors... might just be the perfect time to go ice skating. 
Denver and Beloved register hopefulness in the light of Sethe's attitude. Sethe speaks to Denver; 
SETHE Go get the shawls..and find me an old shoe for that half a pair... 
The girls get excited. Sethe tosses the scrub brush into the pail. 
EXT. A FROZEN CREEK - DAY. 
STAMP PAID This Saturday - you coming to Call or what? 
BABY SUGGS If I call them, and they come what on earth am I going to say to them. 
STAMP PAID Say the Word! 
Two whitemen raking leaves look up at the sound of Stamp Paid's voice, which was too loud. So he whispers; 
STAMP PAID The Word. What you was put here to speak. 
BABY SUGGS That's the last thing they took from me. 
STAMP PAID But you got to do it. You got to. Can't nobody Call like you. You have to be there. 
BABY SUGGS What I have to do is get in my bed and lay down. I want to fix on something harmless in this world. 
STAMP PAID What world are you talking about? Ain't nothing harmless down here. 
BABY SUGGS Blue. That doesn't hurt nobody. Yellow neither. 
STAMP PAID You getting into bed to think about yellow? 
BABY SUGGS I likes yellow. 
STAMP PAID Then what? When you get through with blue and yellow, then what? 
BABY SUGGS Can't say. It's something can't be planned. 
STAMP PAID You blaming God. That what you're doing? 
BABY SUGGS No, Stamp. I ain't. 
STAMP PAID You saying whitefolks won. That what you saying? 
BABY SUGGS Those white things have taken all I had or dreamed. I'm saying ain't no bad luck in this world 'cept for white folks..They just don't know when to stop. 
STAMP PAID You saying nothing counts? 
BABY SUGGS I'm saying they came into my yard. 
STAMP PAID You saying God give up? Nothing left for us but pour out our own blood? 
BABY SUGGS I'm saying they came into my yard. 
STAMP PAID You punishing Him, ain't you? 
BABY SUGGS Not like He punished me. 
STAMP PAID You can't do that, Baby. It ain't right. 
BABY SUGGS Was a time I knew what was. 
STAMP PAID You still know. 
BABY SUGGS What I know is what I see: a nigger woman hauling shoes. 
STAMP PAID Aw, Baby. 
He stops her, before the Twin Chestnuts of the Tucker house. 
STAMP PAID We have to be steady. "These things too will pass". What you looking for? A miracle? 
BABY SUGGS No. I'm looking for what I was put here to look for: the back door. 
They exchange a look of silence and finality. She turns and walks to the back door of the house and knocks. A moment later a White Woman appears, takes the carpetbag and keeps Baby waiting on the back steps while she goes in for a dime. Baby rests on the railing until the whitewoman returns. 
MEMORY END. 
EXT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - DAY. 
Now, Stamp Paid feels the need to find out what's going on inside 124 since he caused Paul to leave. He approaches the porch, then the front door. He raises his hands to knock - but he can't bring himself to do it. 
He turns to walk away then stops. He turns back and with a force of will, KNOCKS LOUDLY upon the door. No answer. He KNOCKS AGAIN. Still no answer. 
He steps back, trying to sense if anyone's there. He turns to leave when he sees; 
TWO HEADS in the window. Denver and Beloved. Denver bolts away, but Beloved remains a moment longer - looking in Stamp Paid's eye, then disappearing into the house. 
Stamp Paid is unnerved by her look. 
INT. SAWYER'S RESTAURANT - LATE MORNING. 
Sethe enters late, putting on her apron as SAWYER yells; 
SAWYER What the hell you thinking, girl? Strolling in here this late? 
SETHE Don't talk to me, Mr. Sawyer. Don't say nothing to me this morning. 
SAWYER What? What? You talking back to me? 
SETHE I'm telling you don't say nothing to me. 
Sethe begins organizing her counter to make pies. 
SAWYER You better get them pies made! 
Sethe ignores him as she begins. Sawyer is at a loss. 
SAWYER Not too sweet! You make it too sweet they don't eat it. 
SETHE Make it the way I always do. 
SAWYER Yeah. Too sweet. (he exits) 
INT. ELLA'S HOUSE - DAY. 
Ella opens the front door for Stamp Paid. He looks disturbed. 
ELLA Where you been keeping yourself? I told John must be cold if Stamp stay inside. 
STAMP PAID Oh I been out. 
Stamp takes off his hat and follows Ella, who is doing laundry in the kitchen. 
ELLA Out where? 
EXT. BLUESTONE ROAD - EARLY EVENING. 
Sethe is walking home to her daughters. There is a serene, introverted expression on her face...as if she were detached from the world around her, safe inside. We hear her thoughts: 
SETHE (VO) Beloved, she my daughter...She mine. She come back to me of her own free will and I don't have to explain a thing.. She had to be safe and I put her where I knew she would be. But my love was tough and she back now. She come back to me in the flesh...I won't never let her go. I'll explain to her, even though I don't have to. Why I did it. How if I hadn't killed her she would have died and that is something I couldn't let happen to her. When I explain she'll understand, cause she understands everything already..And she ain't even mad...When I put that headstone up I wanted to lay in there with you, put your head on my shoulder and keep you warm and I would have if Bulgar and Howard and Denver didn't need me, because my mind was homeless then. I couldn't lay down with you then. No matter how much I wanted to. I couldn't lay down nowhere in peace, back then. Now I can. I can sleep like the drowned, have mercy. She come back to me, my daughter, 
DENVER'S VOICE OVER FADES IN OVER SETHE'S.... 
SETHE (VO)              DENVER my Beloved and she        Beloved is my is mine....               sister... 
DENVER (VO) ..and she is mine... 
FADE TO; 
INT. 124 BLUESTONE ROAD - EARLY EVENING. 
Denver is cleaning the kitchen, waiting for her mother. We hear her thoughts: 
DENVER (VO) ..I swallowed her blood right along with my mother's milk. She played with me and always came to be with me whenever I needed her. Me and her waited for our daddy. I love her. I do. She never hurt me. I love my mother but I know she killed one of her own, and tender as she is with me, I'm scared of her because of it. All the time, I'm afraid the thing that happened that made it all right to kill her own, could happen again. Whatever it is, it comes from outside this house, outside the yard. So I never leave this house and I watch over the yard so it can't happen again ... I have to keep it away from my sister...I'll protect Beloved...'Cause She's mine... 
BELOVED'S VO FADES IN OVER DENVER'S... 
DENVER (VO)               BELOVED (VO) Beloved..She's mine       I am Beloved 
BELOVED (VO) and she is mine... 
EXT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - EARLY EVENING. 
Beloved, waiting for Sethe to come home, sees her approaching. We hear her thoughts: 
BELOVED (VO) I am not separate from her. There is no place where I stop. Her face is my own and I want to be there in the place where her face is and to be looking at it too...a hot thing..In the beginning I could see her. I could not help her because the clouds were in the way. But I could see her. The shining in her ears. I look hard at her so she will know that the clouds are in the way..I cannot lose her again. I see her face which is mine. It is the face that was going to smile at me in the place where we crouched before I come up out of the blue water. Sethe's is the face that left me. Sethe's sees me in her and I see the smile. She is my face smiling at me. It is the face I lost. Now we can join..a hot thing. 
Sethe comes to the waiting Beloved and smiles. She offers her hand and Beloved rises. Denver exits to them and smiles. She extends her hand to Beloved's free hand. The three women stand astride each other, arms around each other's waist as they walk toward the porch... 
The dusk sunlight creates THREE SHADOWS - three figures holding each other the way Sethe saw the shadows at the carnival...Only they weren't Hers, Denver's and Paul's...They were Hers, Denver's and Beloved's.... 
INT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - EARLY EVENING. 
The girls rush into the house, and down the hall. 
Sethe enters. Then turns back to the door. 
C.U. ; OF SETHE'S HAND LOCKING THE FRONT DOOR AS WE HEAR; 
SETHE (VO) 
I AM BELOVED AND SHE IS MINE..     DENVER (VO) SHE IS MINE... 
OVER THE FOLLOWING CHORUS OF DIALOGUE, A MONTAGE OF IMAGES DEPICTING SETHE, BELOVED AND DENVER CLOSING UP THE HOUSE FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD - LOWERING SHADES, LOCKING WINDOWS, BARRING DOORS..... 
SETHE (VO) 
TELL ME THE TRUTH..              BELOVED (VO) CANNOT LOSE HER AGAIN. 
SETHE (VO) DID YOU COME FROM THE OTHER SIDE. 
BELOVED (VO) YES. I WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE. 
SETHE (VO) YOU CAME BACK BECAUSE OF ME? 
BELOVED (VO) YES. 
SETHE (VO) YOU NEVER FORGOT ME? 
BELOVED (VO) YOUR FACE IS MINE. 
DENVER (VO) DON'T LOVE HER TOO MUCH. 
SETHE (VO) DO YOU FORGIVE ME? 
BELOVED (VO) YOU HURT ME. 
DENVER (VO) I WILL PROTECT YOU. 
SETHE (VO) WILL YOU STAY? 
BELOVED (VO) WHY DID YOU LEAVE ME WHO AM YOU? 
SETHE (VO) I WILL NEVER LEAVE YOU AGAIN. 
DENVER (VO) WATCH OUT FOR HER; SHE CAN GIVE YOU DREAMS. 
BELOVED (VO) WHERE ARE THE MEN WITHOUT SKIN? 
DENVER (VO) THE WHITEFOLK? 
SETHE (VO) OUT THERE. WAY OFF. 
DENVER (VO) DADDY IS COMING FOR US. 
BELOVED (VO) CAN THEY GET IN HERE? 
SETHE (VO) NO. THEY TRIED ONCE BUT I STOPPED THEM. THEY WON'T EVER COME BACK...YOU MY BEST THING. 
EXT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - EARLY EVENING. 
CAMERA PULLS BACK FROM THE FRONT DOOR, NOW LOCKED AGAINST THE WORLD, IN A SLOW MOVE....AS WE HEAR A BLEND OF THE THREE WOMEN'S VOICES - THE OVERLAPPING, HAUNTED THOUGHTS OF THE LIVING... 
THREE WOMAN (VO) BELOVED..YOU ARE MY SISTER..YOU ARE MY DAUGHTER. YOU ARE MY FACE..YOU ARE ME..I HAVE FOUND YOU AGAIN..I WAITED FOR YOU..YOU ARE MY BELOVED. DON'T LOVE HER TOO MUCH...YOU MY BEST THING.. YOU ARE MINE..YOU ARE MINE..YOU ARE MINE... 
BY THE TIME THE CAMERA REACHES BLUESTONE ROAD, THE VOICES ARE MIXED, UNDECIPHERABLE YET AUDIBLE... 
...AUDIBLE TO STAMP PAID, WHO STANDS ON BLUESTONE RD. LISTENING TO THE HAUNTED VOICES OF 124.  HE IS FRIGHTENED. 
FADE -OUT. 
FADE- IN: 
EXT. CHURCH - DAY. 
A cold day. Paul D. sits against the church drinking from a bottle when a voice causes him to look up; 
STAMP PAID Howdy. 
Stamp has his hands in his pockets, moving about. 
EXT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - MORNING. 
The sun shines on a warm April day..a day abundant with growth and renewed hope. 
But a shadow appears to be hovering over 124. It looks more worn than before...neglected, abused. 
A broken window...the front door off it's hinge...a front step splintered and dangerous. 
INT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - MORNING. 
Camera opens on the front hall and moves through the house, revealing the same neglect inside; 
Broken furniture, dusty floors, mess and disorder... 
Camera enters; 
INT. KITCHEN - MORNING. 
Dirty pans, crusted food on the table, window curtains hanging askew... 
Sethe sits hunched over, asleep, in a chair against the wall. She wears a dirty, torn dress that hangs on her body - which seems withered, frailer since we last saw her...In her lap lies a clean pretty dress she was in the process of sewing when she fell asleep from fatigue. 
A LOUD CRASH wakes her up. Followed by a LOUD FRUSTRATED YELL. Her face registers fear. She realizes where she is, what time it is...and begins organizing breakfast... 
She places the dress neatly on the chair, then grabs a cloth and wipes away the crumbs and dirty plates from supper, placing them in the sink... 
She opens a pantry cupboard to reveal BARE SHELVES except for a SINGLE EGG and a bowl of HOMINY GRAINS about 1/4 full. She searches in a panic for more food - anywhere - opening cabinets, doors - places that never stored food. She realizes there is none left. 
INT. DENVER'S ROOM - MORNING. 
Denver finished dressing. She has been able to maintain a semblance of order about her person and room.. 
But as she steps out into the second floor hallway, we see the same disarray as downstairs... 
She passes by Baby Sugg's old room and discovers; 
BELOVED, sprawled across the bed, half naked. Her belly is huge, her body unwashed. She looks, and behaves, like a wild animal... 
A broken lamp lies on the fall - pushed over by her leg as she shifted in bed. Her feet, overhanging the bed, are still touching the bedside table where the lamp sat. 
She is awake now - making a small hole larger in Baby Sugg's old quilt. 
DENVER You shouldn't be in here? 
Beloved jolts her head up to Denver. She doesn't like being looked at unawares... 
BELOVED What do you know about it? I sleep where I want. 
DENVER You best leave that quilt alone. That was grandma's quilt. 
Beloved looks at Denver, then at the quilt - then abruptly tears the hole apart with one strong pull. 
Triumphant, she gets out of bed and exits, passing Denver; 
BELOVED Breakfast ready? I'm hungry! 
INT. KITCHEN - MORNING. 
Sethe has prepared all the food that was left and placed it on one plate which she sets on the table. She stands at the stove, with her back to us, picking crusted pieces of food off the bottom of the pan. 
Beloved moves straight to the chair in front of the place and begins to eat, shovelling the food into her mouth. 
Denver sees her mother covertly eating the burnt pan crumbs, as she pretends to wash the dishes. 
SETHE Morning. 
DENVER Morning, ma'am. 
Sethe turns, not realizing Denver was there as well. Their eyes meet. Sethe wonders if her daughter saw her eating the pan crumbs. She smiles; 
SETHE You hungry? 
Knowing there must be nothing left, Denver answers; 
DENVER No, ma'am. 
Sethe looks relieved. 
DENVER I'll finish those. Why don't you sit down? 
Denver crosses to the dishes, taking the pan from her mother. Sethe nods and crosses to the table, to sit down. 
But as she sinks into the chair, Beloved kicks it away; 
BELOVED You don't sit with me!! 
SETHE Baby, don't be like that. 
BELOVED You don't sit with me!! I don't sit with people who leave me! 
SETHE Don't talk like that. Your mama loves you. 
BELOVED I had another dream last night. (as she eats) The dead man laying on top of me and I had nothing to eat. And the ghosts without skin stuck their fingers in me and said Beloved in the dark and bitch in the light.. 
SETHE Don't say those things. You forget about those dreams.. 
BELOVED You gave me the bad dreams. You left me behind... 
SETHE Mama told you - I'd give up my own life, every minute, every hour of it to take back one of your tears baby...My children my best thing. You my best thing! 
BELOVED You're weren't nice to me..you didn't smile at me.. 
SETHE That's not true. I told you, I had to get you out, make you safe...so's you and me could be together on the other side, forever.. 
DENVER Ma'am... 
No one pays attention to Denver. 
BELOVED LIAR! 
Beloved flings her plate at Sethe, hitting her hard across the eye..the plate breaking... 
DENVER MAMA! 
SETHE Hold back Denver - I'm fine..You..you go on upstairs. I'll do the cleaning up. 
The TWO BLACK MEN pass her, tipping their hats, saying; 
TWO BLACK MAN Morning...Morning.. 
And they walk by. Denver's eyes speak the gratitude she never got her mouth open in time to reply. Heartened by the encounter, she picks up speed. 
EXT. LADY JONES' HOUSE - DAY. 
LADY JONES - a light-skinned black woman with gray eyes and yellow woolly hair - opens the door to find Denver. 
LADY JONES Why Denver..Look at you. 
Denver manages to smile. 
LADY JONES It's been so long. It's so nice of you to come see me. What brings you? 
Unfortunately, Denver can't manage anything beyond the smile. 
LADY JONES Well, never mind - nobody needs a reason to visit. Let me make us some tea. Come on. 
Lady Jones takes her by the hand and leads her inside. 
INT. LADY JONES' HOUSE - DAY. 
Tea things sit on a table between them. Denver eats whatever she can. Lady Jones watches with care and concern. 
LADY JONES How's your family, honey? 
Denver swallows a bite of something with some tea, then; 
DENVER I want to work, Miss Lady. 
LADY JONES Work? Start learnin your letters again? 
DENVER No. I mean work work. 
LADY JONES Well, what can you do? 
DENVER I can't do anything but I would learn it for you if you have a little extra. 
LADY JONES Extra? 
DENVER Food. My mama, she doesn't feel well. I couldn't stay away from her too long, cause of her condition but I could do chores in the mornings. 
LADY JONES Oh baby...I don't know anyone could pay anybody anything for work they did themselves...But if you all need to eat until your mother's well, all you have to do is say so...We have a church committee invented so nobody had to go hungry. 
DENVER No..No that won't do... 
Lady Jones can sense something far more serious is going on. 
INT. 124 BLUESTONE RD./ KITCHEN - DAY. 
Denver brings four eggs, some rice and some tea onto the kitchen table. 
Sethe's eyes well up. She looks at Denver as if for the first time. Her face an expression of gratitude. Suddenly; 
BELOVED (OS) RAAAIN!!! RAAAAIN! 
Sethe and Denver rush out of the kitchen to see; 
beloved running through the rooms, clawing at her throat, causing it to bleed... 
SETHE BABY! 
Sethe and Denver rush towards into the keeping room. Sethe stumbles over a chair to get to Beloved, kneeling on the floor, ripping at her own neck... 
Denver gets her from behind and Sethe grabs her from the front, pinning her down - trying to stop her from hurting herself. Beloved screams and strikes out at Sethe, pulling her hair, clawing at her as well... 
EXT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - DAY. 
Denver exits the house because she sees something unusual in the yard; 
POV - THE STUMP; 
On the same stump that Beloved first appeared, sits A BASKET OF EGGS. Denver crosses to it, lifts it and a PAPER flutters to the ground. She reads it; 
M. LUCILLE WILLIAMS... 
EXT. M. LUCILLE WILLIAMS HOUSE - DAY. 
Denver returns the empty basket to M. Lucille Williams. 
DENVER Thank you. 
M. LUCILLE WILLIAMS Your welcome.. 
INT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - DAY. 
Beloved eats ravenously from a bowl of white beans. Sethe sits in the corner, as if waiting to serve her... 
EXT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - DAY 
Upon the stump, sits a plate of cold rabbit meat, which Denver brings inside. 
INT. GRACE'S HOUSE - DAY. 
Denver is returning a bowl to Grace, a friendly woman. 
GRACE No, darling. That's not my bowl. Mine's got a blue ring around it..Would you like to come in a spell? 
INT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - DAY. 
Beloved sleeps curled up on the kitchen floor after eating - her mouth still dirty from the meal... 
Sethe, unwashed, her hair uncombed, sits in her corner chair. She is trying to mend a torn dress. 
Denver eats a little from the latest neighborhood gift. She hears her mother mumbling to herself like a madwoman. 
SETHE Nobody..no sir..that's right..nobody's going be doing that..nobody going be writing my daughter's characteristics on the animal side..no sir..I don't care..ain't laying that down..no sir. I refuse..that's right..that's right... 
DENVER Mama...Mama she's asleep. Why don't you eat something. 
SETHE She likes this dress... 
DENVER But you'll hurt your eyes doin it there. Come sit at the table. 
DENVER Mama?....Mama I'm going out.. (no response) Mama, I got a job. Working over at the Bodwins at night. Mr. Bodwin coming over now to pick me up on his way back from town. I'll be staying there nights and coming back here for the daytime. We'll have some money, mama..Mama? 
Sethe continues her action as if hypnotized. Denver approaches her from behind and whispers softly; 
DENVER I'm going help you, mama. Don't you give up yet. 
Denver touches her gently, but Sethe acts as if she hears and feels nothing. Denver exits. 
EXT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - LATE THAT DAY. 
Denver is sitting on the stump waiting for Mr. Bodwin when she hears; 
THIRTY WOMEN, gathered together, walking up Bluestone Rd. towards 124, SINGING A HOLY SONG; 
Denver is amazed by the sight as the women position themselves right in front of 124 - armed with bibles, crucifixes and whatever other symbols of heavenly power they could find. 
INT. 124 BLUESTONE RD; THE KEEPING ROOM - DAY. 
Sethe is rubbing a naked Beloved's forehead with a cool cloth filled with ice, when the two women hear the singing. 
Beloved rises first and moves to the window to see. 
EXT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - DAY. 
The women continue singing. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. FURTHER DOWN BLUESTONE RD. - DAY. 
MR. BODWIN, sitting on a wagon pulled by a horse, is riding toward 124 when he hears the singing as well. 
WE NOTICE THAT MR. BODWIN IS WEARING A HAT SIMILAR TO THE ONE SCHOOLTEACHER WORE on that fateful day. 
CUT BACK TO: 
EXT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - DAY. 
The women continue singing as: 
Sethe and Beloved, her belly as big as a pregnant woman's, exit the house. 
The women are stunned by the sight and slightly confused by the lack of fear between the women. 
Sethe is holding Beloved's hand. Beloved is smiling brightly at the beautiful singing. 
Denver looks to her mother; 
Tears run down Sethe's face but she is not crying. The sound of the women's voices wash over her like a baptism. She looks to all the women, faces she remembers, faces she has missed although up until this moment was not conscious of missing. 
Then, Sethe looks beyond the women and sees: 
MR. BODWIN APPROACHING IN HIS WAGON. SHE SEES MR. BODWIN WEARING A HAT THAT LOOKS LIKE SCHOOLTEACHERS. 
Sethe's expression turns to fear, then rage. In her ravaged mind, she thinks it is Schoolteacher coming back... 
SETHE No...No, he's not coming into my yard. He not taking my best thing...No.. 
She releases Beloved's hand and moves forward... 
SETHE No...no...no.. 
DENVER Mama? 
She passes Denver, feeling for the ICE PICK IN HER APRON. 
SETHE No...NO..NO..NOOOOOOOOOOOO! 
As Mr. Bodwin reaches the thirty women who separate him from 124. HIS EYES FOCUS IN WONDER ON THE NAKED BELOVED AS; 
SETHE RUNS TOWARDS HIM AND THE WOMEN, HER HAND EXTENDED HOLDING THE ICE PICK.. 
DENVER MAMA...NOOOOOOO! 
DENVER RUNS AFTER HER. SETHE REACHES THE WOMEN AND LUNGES FOR BODWIN BUT THE WOMEN SEIZE HER, CREATING A HILL OF BLACK PEOPLE. SETHE RISING TO THE TOP, HER HAND EXTENDED. DENVER REACHING HER FROM BEHIND, PULLING HER BACK AND PUNCHING HER OUT COLD AS THE BODIES FALL AROUND THEM.... 
Beloved watches from the house - watches Sethe attack and defend with the ice pick.  And something within her is resolved. For a moment, we see a calm spirit instead of a wild animal. And a tear upon her face.. 
Then, just as quickly, she sprints around the side of the house and disappears from view. 
The Women try to help Sethe as Denver cries for her mother. Mr. Bodwin looks on stunned. 
WIDE ANGLE - OF A NAKED BLACK WOMAN WITH A FULL BELLY RUNNING THROUGH AN OPEN FIELD, REACHING THE WOODS THEN DISAPPEARING INTO THE TREES...... 
FADE OUT; 
FADE IN: 
EXT. RICHMOND ST. - DAY. WEEKS LATER. 
Paul D. is on his way to work when he sees; 
A poised, confident Denver walking in the opposite direction. She spots him and smiles; 
DENVER Good morning, Paul D. 
Paul is clearly impressed by the sight of her. 
PAUL Well, is it now? How you getting along? 
DENVER Don't pay to complain. 
PAUL You on your way home? 
DENVER No. Got me an afternoon job at the shirt factory. Figure between that and my night work at the Bodwins I might be able to put something away for me and mama. 
PAUL They treating you right over at the Bodwins? 
DENVER More than all right. Miss Bodwin, she teach me stuff..Book stuff. She says I might go to Oberlin. She's experimenting on me. 
Paul smiles - wanting to warn her but deciding not to spoil the possibilities that lay before her. 
PAUL Your mother all right? 
DENVER No. Not a bit all right. Hasn't gotten out of bed since that day.

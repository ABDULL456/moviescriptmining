"HARD RAIN" 
Screenplay by 
Graham Yost 
SHOOTING DRAFT 
FADE IN 
RAIN 
Falls from low grey clouds. Down below we see... 
THE RIVER 
Muddy, slow and powerful, overflowing its banks. In the near distance is... 
THE RESERVOIR 
Filled to the maximum, water thundering out of two open gates. We close in on... 
THE DAM 
There's a Dam Control Office in the middle of the dam. We MOVE OFF the reservoir and head out over... 
THE TOWN OF HUNTINGBURG 
We see "NO FEAR" spelled out in stones on one man's roof. We go down and into... 
EXT. STREETS OF HUNTINGBURG - DUSK 
Storefronts are sandbagged and closed. A sign on one store reads: GONE FISHING. A sign on another: HEY LOOTER. NOTHING OF VALUE HERE. TRY NEXT DOOR. And on the next store: HE'S LYING. 
A CHURCH 
Beautiful, old, ringed with a five-foot-high wall of sandbags. The floodwater is up to the first level of sandbags. 
CARS AND PICKUP TRUCKS 
Loaded down, are heading out of town on streets covered in the first water of the flood. 
A STATUE 
On an island in the middle of the street. It's Civil War- era, of a general on a horse, sword held high. The floodwater is over the curb, lapping at the base of statue's pedestal. Near the statue stands... 
THE SHERIFF 
50s, with soft edges and friendly eyes. He's talking into his radio mike. 
SHERIFF So, are we all going to die? 
EXT. RESERVOIR DAM 
HANK, the dam control officer, is on the radio with the Sheriff. 
HANK Not right now. But I'm gonna have to let out a little more. 
EXT. MAIN STREET 
WAYNE and PHIL, two deputies, 30s, are near the Sheriff, shoring up a sandbag wall that has partially collapsed. 
PHIL I think my best was when I turned twelve. My Dad set up a treasure hunt. It was really cool. (off Wayne's disdainful look) Well, it was. 
Wayne shrugs a "whatever" and pulls a sandbag up out of the water. There's unpleasant-looking muck all over his arms. He drops the sandbag back into the water and shakes off the crud with disgust. 
WAYNE This blows. 
PHIL My most awful birthday was sweet sixteen. I had mono. How about you? What was your worst? 
WAYNE You kidding? You think I could've possibly had a birthday worse than this? What kind of loser do you think I am? 
SHERIFF (O.S.) Don't answer that, Phil. 
The Sheriff walks over. 
SHERIFF Hank says he's gonna open another gate. We're gonna get another rise. 
They turn at the sound of honking. The MAYOR drives up. 
MAYOR Gentlemen. Hey -- happy birthday, Wayne. 
Wayne nods. Phil stiffens. They do not like this guy. 
MAYOR (to the Sheriff) Mike, I gotta say, what you're doing... I don't know if I'd be here, considering. 
SHERIFF (good-natured) Well, you would be if you wanted to get the last couple of paychecks some bastard owed you. 
MAYOR (grins, then:) I just want you to know I think the people 'round here made a big mistake. 
Phil grumbles to himself. 
PHIL "The people"? You're the one who screwed him. 
MAYOR Sorry, Phil? 
PHIL (blushes) I, uh -- 
SHERIFF (to Mayor, saving Phil) You know, Bob, as much as I'd love to stand here all day talking about how great I am, if you don't get moving I'm gonna have to haul your sorry ass off to jail. 
MAYOR (laughs) Okay, okay, I'm going. Keep up the good work, boys. It's appreciated. 
The Mayor rolls up his window and heads off. 
WAYNE Whaddya say we go torch the fucker's house and blame it on looters. Or how about we put a dead cow in his living room. He comes back after it's been in the water a couple of days. Hello! 
SHERIFF (shakes head) You wanna know how to get the best revenge on the Mayor and his boys? You do exactly what we're doing. You protect the town. You protect it better than they would. Better than they ever could. 
TOM You've got a major hair growth going on. 
CHARLIE Shut up. 
TOM I'm serious. You're gonna need somebody to go in there with a weed whacker. 
Charlie grabs a donut bag off the seat and tosses it to Tom. 
CHARLIE Here. 
TOM You're offering me one of your donuts? I don't know what to say. I'm getting all misty. 
CHARLIE If it'll shut your mouth you can have the whole bag. 
Charlie starts the truck. Tom thinks about it, then tosses the bag back. 
TOM Nah. I start eating donuts and I'll never get out of this truck. 
CHARLIE (disgusted) I love how you think you're better than this. 
TOM Don't get me wrong, Charlie. There's a lot to like about this job -- and I don't just mean the dashing polyester ensemble and the solid three-figure income. 
CHARLIE (angry) You ungrateful shit! I don't believe you! 
TOM (surprised) Charlie, relax! I was kidding! 
CHARLIE You don't wanna do this? Fine. Go back to selling hot construction machinery. That's a helluva career. 
TOM It had better hours. 
Charlie slams the clipboard down on the seat. 
CHARLIE You think this is a joke? This is funny? Jesus Christ! You know how lucky you are you could get in here? Thirty years old and all the crap you pulled and you never got caught? 
TOM (angry) That wasn't luck, old man. That was skill. I was good at it. 
CHARLIE Oh, yeah, it takes a lot of skill to fence bulldozers. That's goddamn genius time. 
TOM About as much skill as it takes to sit in a truck and get fat eating donuts. 
CHARLIE Oh, so that's all I've been doing, huh? Just wasting my life away. 
TOM I didn't say that. 
CHARLIE Yeah, building a home, raising a family -- that's just stupid. 
TOM I didn't say that! 
CHARLIE You know what, Tom? I really don't give a shit what you said. 
Tom doesn't reply. Charlie puts the truck in gear; starts off. Tom looks at Charlie, shakes his head -- what was that about? 
EXT. ROADSIDE BAR - ESTABLISHING - DUSK 
INT. ROADSIDE BAR - DUSK ECU PEN ON PAPER 
Writing letters in a crossword puzzle. Holding the pen is... 
JIM 
Late 50s, with a creased face and piercing eyes. He's sitting at the bar, drinking coffee. Rain sheets down outside. The BARTENDER watches TV, sound off. Next to Jim at the bar are... 
RAY, KENNY AND MR. MEHLOR 
Ray, 40s, has lank hair, rheumy eyes and a glass of Irish whisky in front of him. Kenny, 20s, long hair, has the energy of a puppy -- unfortunately he has about as much smarts as a puppy. Mr. Mehlor. 40s, looks like -- and was -- a high school teacher. 
ON TV 
Sound off, a MAN is crying about what he has lost in the flood. 
RAY "Thus saith the Lord; Behold, waters shall rise up out of the north and be an overflowing flood and all the inhabitants of the land shall howl." Jeremiah 47:2. 
Ray takes a drink. Kenny leans over to Ray, sotto. 
KENNY You're gonna be able to buy a helluva lot of bibles, huh, Ray? Me? First thing I'm gonna do is get my brother a lawyer. Best that money can buy. 
A thought comes to Jim -- an answer to a clue in the crossword -- and he starts filling in words as Ray and Kenny talk. 
RAY What's he facing? 
KENNY Thirty in. 
RAY He cap a cop or something...? 
KENNY Security guard. "In the commission..." All he's got is a piece of shit P.D. Now I'm gonna be able to afford him a good lawyer -- a guy with a haircut. 
Jim leans over to Kenny. 
JIM 'Scuse me a second. Take a look at thirty-one across. 
Jim slides the newspaper in front of Kenny. 
KENNY Shit, Jim. I don't do crossword puzzles. 
MR. MEHLOR I'll take a look, Jim. 
JIM Kenny can read. (to Kenny) Just look at it. You know when you write down a word and suddenly it looks all wrong? Maybe it's right, but it doesn't look right? 
Jim points at the newspaper. 
JIM Thirty-one across. 
Kenny shrugs and looks down at the newspaper. 
KENNY (mumbles as he reads) Mention money again and... 
His eyes go wide. 
HOME OF THE 1987 STATE CHAMPION WARRIORS. 
IN THE TRUCK 
CHARLIE Goddammit! 
TOM It's a little dip in the road or something. You can see the reflectors come up the other side. 
CHARLIE (curses to himself) I knew this would happen. (grabs radio mike) 
TOM I'll see if there's anyone coming. Maybe we can get pulled out. 
Tom opens the door. Charlie adjusts the radio frequency selection button; clicks on. 
CHARLIE Dispatch, this is 31. 31 calling dispatch. 
DISPATCHER (V.O.) (over radio) 31, this is dispatch. 
CHARLIE (into radio) Dispatch, we're stuck outside of Huntingburg. Truck's dead. 
DISPATCHER (V.O.) Where are you? 
CHARLIE We're on 231, headed for the Interstate. Right by a sign saying "Welcome to Huntingburg." 
Tom climbs out and up on top of the truck. 
OUTSIDE THE TRUCK 
Tom stands on top of the truck. In one direction, nothing but blackness. The other way he can see the lights of the town. But there are no cars coming. 
IN THE TRUCK 
Charlie looks over as Tom appears, upside-down, in the doorway. 
TOM The town's been evacuated. We won't get any help from there. 
CHARLIE Dispatch can't get anyone out. 
TOM They are aware we're carrying a shitload of money...? 
CHARLIE They called the National Guard. They're gonna be here in about ninety minutes. 
TOM Ninety minutes? Jesus. 
CHARLIE (nods; into radio) Dispatch, we're gonna need help a little sooner than -- 
There's a sudden sparking sound and the radio cuts out and interior lights and the headlights go out. 
TOM Oh, shit. 
INT. HOUSE - DUSK POV THROUGH WINDOW 
Looking out as the Sheriff's car rolls past on the water- covered street. A HAND lets go of a curtain and it swings across the window. 
EXT. STREET - DUSK IN THE SHERIFF'S CAR 
The Sheriff motions Wayne to stop the car, then he grabs the radio mike and clicks it on as a megaphone. 
SHERIFF (into mike) Henry, I saw you. Come on out. 
No one comes out of the house. 
SHERIFF Henry, I'm not leaving until you come out. 
A few moments pass and then... 
HENRY AND DOREEN SWERZKY 
Late 70s, step out onto their porch. 
DOREEN Jesus H. Christ, Henry, I told you to stay away from the damn window. 
THE SHERIFF 
Gets out of the car. 
SHERIFF What are you still doing here? 
HENRY We're just -- 
DOREEN We're setting traps. 
SHERIFF That's illegal, Doreen. 
DOREEN You gonna arrest us, Sheriff? Hell, are you even sheriff anymore, Sheriff? Didn't you lose an election? I sure as hell know I didn't vote for you, and neither did Henry. 
HENRY Doreen... 
SHERIFF You don't need to set traps. 
DOREEN That's what they said in '73. When we got back, anything the bastards didn't steal they broke, just for the hell of it. 
SHERIFF That's not happening this time. 
DOREEN Damn right it's not. 
SHERIFF You can't stay, you know that. 
HENRY We're going to my sister's. 
SHERIFF Good. 
DOREEN Soon as we finish setting the traps. 
The Sheriff wants to say something more, but he's not about to argue with Doreen. He just nods and gets back into the car. 
IN THE CAR 
Stiffens. 
KENNY'S FINGER 
Squeezes the trigger of his rifle. 
TOM 
Jumps at the sound of the rifle crack. 
CHARLIE 
Is knocked back. 
TOM 
Yanks out his gun and starts shooting back. 
JIM AND HIS MEN 
Duck down in the water. 
TOM 
Shooting blindly, looks over and sees... 
CHARLIE 
A horrible look on his face, blood coming out of his neck. He sinks into the water. 
KENNY 
Shoots off another few quick rounds. 
TOM 
Drops into the water, bullets plugging in around him. Just his hand and pistol are visible, shooting blindly back toward Jim and his men. THE SUBURBAN 
Is hit by Tom's fire. 
TOM 
Runs out of bullets. A beat later we see Charlie start moving through the water -- Tom is pulling him. 
JIM STOP SHOOTING! 
KENNY 
Doesn't hear Jim and keeps firing. 
JIM 
Aims his pistol at Kenny's head. 
JIM Stop. 
Kenny stops. 
BEHIND THE ARMORED TRUCK 
Tom comes up in the water behind the truck, gasping, holding Charlie. Tom rests his gun on the truck bumper. 
CHARLIE I'm sorry, Tom. 
Charlie's gone. 
JIM AND HIS MEN 
Jim glares at Kenny, his eyes on fire. 
KENNY He was going for his gun! 
JIM He wasn't gonna shoot, Kenny. Goddamnit! (shakes head, calls to Tom) We just want the money! Get away and we won't have to kill you! 
TOM 
Shuts his eyes, thinking, scared. 
JIM (O.S.) Now! 
Tom opens his eyes. He looks down at... 
CHARLIE 
Floating in the water. 
TOM 
What the hell is he going to do? 
JIM AND HIS MEN 
Jim's men look at him. Jim motions them to wait some more. 
JIM You got thirty seconds to get the hell away! 
Jim and the others wait, but there's no answer from Tom. 
JIM The clock's running! Go! 
Still no response from Tom. 
THEIR POV 
All they can see is the front of the truck, in the light of the "Welcome" sign. They can't see the back. 
JIM AND HIS MEN 
The name WILLIAM PORTMAN is chiseled into a crypt. Tom appears from underwater, gasping for breath. He gets to his feet and trudges off through the water. 
EXT. ROAD OUTSIDE CEMETERY 
Tom comes out through the gates of the cemetery, splashing through the knee-deep water. He's running when he hears, from behind him, boat engines firing up. He turns to see... 
LIGHTS 
Racing toward him over the water, a hundred and fifty yards back. 
TOM 
Sprints off. 
THE SKI-BOAT 
Jim is steering the ski-boat. Mr. Mellor hunkers down beside him. We PULL BACK to see... 
TWO JET-SKIS 
Flanking the ski-boat, piloted by Kenny and Ray. 
ON THE ROAD 
Tom is running as fast as he can. He looks back, sees the ski-boat and jet-skis closing. They'll get him before he gets to town. He suddenly veers off the road toward... 
THE HIGH SCHOOL 
The sign out front reads: GO WARRIORS! 
EXT. HIGH SCHOOL 
Tom runs around the side of the high school. 
JIM AND HIS MEN 
Ride up on the ski-boat and jet-skis and round the corner. 
THEIR POV 
No sign of Tom. 
JIM Cut your engines! 
The engines are shut down. They all drift. Jim shines a flashlight over onto... 
WINDOWS 
There's a hole in a window large enough to climb through. 
INT. HIGH SCHOOL - CLASSROOM 
Tom wades through the classroom, pushing floating desks aside. Flashlight beams stab into the room. Tom hurries to the hall. 
EXT. HIGH SCHOOL 
Jim turns to his men. 
JIM Let's get him out. But for Godsake, whatever you do... (with a hard look at Kenny) ...don't kill him. Not until we find out where he hid that money. 
INT. HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY 
Tom makes his way past banks of lockers, trying to get as far as he can from the probing flashlight beams. 
EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - FRONT DOORS 
Kenny drifts up to the front doors. He pulls on them. Locked. 
JIM Mr. Mehlor? 
MR. MEHLOR 
Reaches into his pack. 
INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY 
Tom tries lockers, looking for a place to hide. 
EXT. FRONT DOORS 
Kenny rides his jet-ski fast away from the front doors and the doors explode. 
INT. SCHOOL FRONT LOBBY 
Tom ducks down as... 
A FIREBALL 
Shoots over him. 
KENNY AND RAY 
Ride the jet-skis into the flooded school. 
UNDERWATER 
Tom is swimming as hard as he can, out of breath. KENNY AND RAY 
Ray goes off down a hall while Kenny idles in the lobby. 
TOM 
Surfaces, gasping. 
KENNY 
Hears the gasp, turns, grinning. 
KENNY 
Fires, misses and is knocked to the side as... 
TOM 
Hunches down on the jet-ski and crashes through the windows. 
EXT. HIGH SCHOOL 
Jim and Mr. Mehlor are moving right outside the windows just as Tom blasts out of the school and races off into the dark. 
EXT. OPEN WATER 
Tom moves fast over the water. He yanks off his clip-on tie. 
JIM AND THE OTHERS 
Chase Tom's light, behind by fifty yards, heading out into farm fields. They get closer and closer and then watch as... 
TOM'S JET-SKI 
Runs straight into a tree and explodes. 
JIM AND THE OTHERS 
Race up to find the burning, flaming wreckage of the jet- ski. Ray circles on the other jet-ski. Kenny, still bleeding from the head, is in the boat with Jim and Mr. Mehlor. 
KENNY (laughing) Nice driving, buttwipe! 
RAY I'm glad you're enjoying this, Kenny, but if he's dead, how do we find the money? 
Kenny reacts -- oh, right. 
JIM Oh, he's still alive. 
We see what Jim sees. 
ECU THROTTLE OF JET-SKI 
Tom used his tie to wrap the throttle open. 
HUNDRED YARDS AWAY 
Tom is hiding in the branches of a floating tree, watching the distant lights of Jim and his men. The current carries Tom away. 
WITH JIM AND HIS MEN 
Jim scans the horizon; sees nothing. 
JIM Ray, I'm in need of a little inspiration. 
RAY "With a raging flood he makes an end of those who oppose him, and pursues his enemies into darkness." From one of the more obscure -- 
KENNY Sorry to interrupt Bible study and all, but has no one but me noticed how completely screwed we are? We should be back in the motel room, counting out the money. Instead -- 
Jim lashes out with a fist, hard and fast, hitting Kenny in the chest, knocking him out of the ski-boat, into the water. Kenny comes up in the thigh-deep water, sputtering. 
JIM No one likes this particular turn of events, Kenny, but we have a choice -- we can can either deal with it or we can walk away. There's a lot of money out there, so I choose to deal with it. If you want to go, that's fine -- start swimming. You want to stay, that's fine, too -- just stop your damn whining. 
Jim pushes the throttle forward and the ski-boat takes off, leaving Ray on the jet-ski, with Kenny in the water. 
KENNY What the hell's his problem? All the money in the world ain't worth a goddamn nickel if you get caught. It's not like there won't be other jobs. 
RAY You may have more of these in you, Kenny, but Jim doesn't. 
Ray pulls Kenny up onto the jet-ski and takes off after Jim. 
EXT. BACK OF CHURCH - SANDBAG WALL 
The water level is creeping up a five-foot-high wall of sandbags. 
REVERSE ANGLE 
Looking out over the top of the sandbag wall. A tree floats by on the water. 
HANDS 
Suddenly appear on the top of the wall and... 
TOM 
Pulls himself into view. He climbs over the wall, exhausted. 
BEHIND THE SANDBAG WALL 
Gasoline-powered pumps are sucking up any rainwater. The sandbags have kept the floodwater at bay. 
TOM 
He hurries up the back steps and goes into the church. 
INT. CHURCH - BACK ROOM 
Tom walks through a small room lined with closed cupboards. He goes through a door. 
INT. CHURCH - MAIN HALL 
Tom comes out into the altar. He looks around, impressed. It's a beautiful church. Scaffolding goes up one wall -- the church is being restored. Tom is startled by a sound from above. He grabs a heavy silver candlestick as a weapon and looks up to see... 
BIRDS 
Fluttering up in the rafters. 
TOM 
Takes a breath. Just as he relaxes, he hears a whooshing sound from behind him and turns to see... 
SHERIFF Jesus, Wayne, use your head. If he hadn't hidden it, they woulda killed him, too. 
The Sheriff looks at Tom -- is that it? Tom nods. 
SHERIFF You got any ID? 
TOM No, it was in my jacket and I -- 
WAYNE Color me surprised. 
The Sheriff thinks for a beat, then tosses some keys to Phil. 
SHERIFF Get out two rifles and a shotgun. 
Phil nods and goes to it. The Sheriff opens a desk drawer, pulls out an ankle holster. 
WAYNE You believe him? 
SHERIFF Well, yes, Wayne, I do. And even if I didn't, I'd say we sure as hell had an obligation to check it out, don't you think? 
The Sheriff starts strapping on the ankle holster. 
TOM I'll go with you. I can show you where -- 
SHERIFF No, I think you better stay put. But that was -- 
WAYNE Yeah, all we need is an armored car guy helping us out. 
The Sheriff thwacks Wayne in the ear. 
WAYNE Ow! 
SHERIFF Wayne, what's the worst that's ever happened to you? When old Mrs. Dugan went after you with a knife? This guy just got shot at! (dismisses Wayne; to Tom) Smart move with the money. 
Phil comes over with the guns. 
SHERIFF (to Phil) Wayne and I'll check out the cemetery. You escort Slugger... (nods at Karen) ...out of town. Get her to some high ground, then come on back. 
The Sheriff jams a small pistol into his ankle holster. 
KAREN I have to fill the pumps -- 
SHERIFF (pulling her out) Not any more you don't. 
The Sheriff straightens up, grabs a rifle from Phil and pulls Karen to the door. Wayne goes to Tom's cell door and pulls it shut with a click. 
SHERIFF Wayne... 
WAYNE He could still be lying! 
The Sheriff rolls his eyes and gestures for Wayne to come along. He opens the door for Karen, Wayne and Phil to go through. 
TOM Sheriff -- they killed my partner without any warning. 
SHERIFF And they're gonna regret that, I guarantee you. They're gonna regret coming anywhere near this town tonight. And out he goes. 
EXT. SHERIFF'S STATION 
Water is halfway up the four-foot high wall of sandbags around the station. There are three outboard motorboats moored to the sandbags. 
SHERIFF Phil, take Karen's boat. 
The Sheriff and Wayne climb toward their boats. 
WAYNE You can do it, Phil. The men of Huntingburg are counting on you. 
PHIL Just bite me. 
Wayne laughs as he and the Sheriff fire up their boat engines. 
INT. SHERIFF'S STATION 
Tom hears boat engines start up and move away. He lays back down on the cot, listening to the rain. 
INT. DAM CONTROL OFFICE 
Empty. Light comes out from under the door to the bathroom. 
INT. BATHROOM 
Hank is on the can reading a copy of "American Survivalist" magazine. An odd reaction comes over his face. He feels something weird. He looks down. 
ON THE FLOOR 
Water is seeping in under the door. 
HANK Holy shit! 
INT. DAM CONTROL OFFICE 
The bathroom door flies open and Hank waddles out, pants around his feet. He shuffles fast to the control wheels and starts spinning them. 
EXT. RESERVOIR DAM 
Two gates open fast, all the way, and water thunders out. 
INT. DAM CONTROL OFFICE 
Hank pulls up his pants as he gets on the radio. 
HANK Sheriff! Sheriff! 
EXT. PARK AREA 
The Sheriff and Wayne are motoring in their boats, zooming through the trees, engine noise obliterating anything coming in over the radio. 
INT. DAM CONTROL OFFICE 
Laying on the Sheriff's wooden desk. They're four feet away -- too far to reach. 
EXT. CHURCH 
Karen suddenly has a horrible thought and stops. She shakes it off -- doesn't want to think about it -- and mutters to herself. 
KAREN They'll get him out. 
EXT. MAIN STREET 
Phil is clinging to the statue as the water surges by below him. 
EXT. PARK AREA 
Wayne gets back into his boat. The Sheriff realizes something. 
SHERIFF Wayne... You locked him in. 
INT. SHERIFF'S STATION 
Tom looks through the cell bars at wooden chairs bobbing in the water. The Sheriff's desk lifts up, starts floating. Tom gets an idea. He takes his belt off. 
EXT. NEAR SHERIFF'S STATION 
A telephone pole is half-submerged, being pulled along fast by the current. 
INT. SHERIFF'S STATION 
Tom holds one end of the belt and tosses the rest of it at... 
THE DESK 
Bobbing in the rising water. He misses the keys. 
TOM AND THE DESK 
Tom tries again. The belt lands on the desk top. 
Tom very gently starts pulling. Too hard; the belt starts slipping off the desk. He gets it just right and the desk starts moving toward Tom. He reaches out with his hand, stretching. 
HIS FINGERS 
Touch the top of the desk, start pulling it toward him, and he just gets a firm grip on the desk when... 
THE TELEPHONE POLE 
Smashes into a window, bending in the bars on the window, shattering the glass, letting a torrent of water into the room. 
THE DESK 
Is moved by the rush of water, but not before Tom grabs... 
THE KEYS 
And grips them tight. 
TOM 
Tries the keys in the lock. They don't fit. He looks at them. 
CU KEYS 
The tag is emblazoned with the Ford logo. 
TOM Great! I can drive out of here! 
Tom tosses the keys into the water and looks around at... 
THE WATER LEVEL 
Rising very fast. A foot in ten seconds. 
TOM 
Climbs up the cell bars, the water rising with him. He's running out of room between himself and the ceiling. Three feet. Two feet. He's being pushed up by the water toward... 
FLUORESCENT LIGHT FIXTURE 
On the ceiling, caged in a wire cover. 
TOM 
Is terrified, about to die. The water rises up past his face. 
TOM'S HANDS 
Pull his Maglite flashlight from his belt. He takes off the lens and the battery cap, then shakes the batteries out. 
TOM 
Sticks the flashlight tube up through the wire grate over the light fixture. 
He blows out the water -- like clearing a snorkel -- then breathes. Reprieve for a few moments and then... 
THE WATER 
Reaches the top of the flashlight tube and starts to trickle in when... 
THE FLUORESCENT LIGHT FIXTURE 
Goes dark. In the darkness, there's the sound of tubes breaking and metal being wrenched. 
TOM 
Looks up, astonished, to see... 
THE FLUORESCENT FIXTURE 
Tom and Karen surface, catch their breath. Quiet for a few moments as they both look around to see that Jim and his men are gone. 
KAREN So what do we do? 
TOM I guess just drive around until we run out of gas. 
KAREN (pissed) Look, I've spent the last eight months of my life restoring that church, and I just left it to come save your ass, so spare me, okay? 
TOM (beat) When we get down here a little further we'll find a place for you to hide. (off her look) I'm gonna get back to the truck and wait for the National Guard. (checks watch) They should be there pretty soon. 
Karen nods. Tom looks at her. She's shivering. 
TOM Cold? 
KAREN No, I'm fine. The heater just kicked in. 
Tom looks at her, gives a little grin. Their eyes meet for a second, then they look away. 
EXT. SHERIFF'S STATION 
Phil climbs up onto the roof, exhausted. He sees the hole in the roof and goes to look at it. As he's looking down... 
SHERIFF (O.S.) Is he dead? 
Phil turns to see... 
THE SHERIFF AND WAYNE 
Coasting up in their boats. 
PHIL No. Someone got him out. 
SHERIFF Who? 
PHIL (hesitates) Maybe Karen. 
WAYNE Karen? How could she get him out? You took her out of town. 
PHIL I -- It -- 
SHERIFF Let's hear it, Phil. 
PHIL It happened real fast, okay? 
EXT. ALLEYWAY 
Tom and Karen float down the alley in the car. 
KAREN You ever been robbed before? 
TOM No. The scariest thing that ever happened before was Charlie running out of donuts. (off her look) I've only been doing this for a couple months. 
KAREN (not what she wanted to hear) Oh. 
Silence for a few moments. 
KAREN What'd you do before this? 
TOM I, uh... I sold construction machinery. (off her look) I was making good money, it just... I don't know. It just didn't seem right for me anymore. 
KAREN How'd you end up in this? 
TOM My uncle did me a favor; got me in. 
KAREN Nice favor. How's he gonna feel after tonight? 
TOM My uncle was Charlie -- my partner in the truck. 
KAREN Oh, God. I'm sorry. 
Tom nods -- so is he. 
EXT. SHERIFF'S STATION 
Phil climbs into the Sheriff's boat. 
WAYNE She know karate or something, Phil? Maybe kung fu? I mean, I can't see how else she could overpower the likes of you. 
PHIL Shut up, Wayne. 
SHERIFF Shut up, both of you. Let's go find Karen; see if she's got him. 
The Sheriff fires up his engine and heads off, Wayne following. 
EXT. ALLEYWAY 
Karen and Tom are still in the car. They freeze at the sound of engines in the distance. The sounds fade. Tom looks around. 
TOM God, I wonder whose car this is. 
Karen plucks some cassette tapes out of the water. 
KAREN Well, whoever it is, he listens to Pat Benatar, Eddie Money and the soundtrack to "Footloose." 
TOM Really? (looks at tapes) Hold on... (looks around car) ...I think this is my car from high school. 
Karen laughs. Just then... 
THE CAR 
Gets caught on something and stops. 
TOM Looks like we get out here. (Karen hesitates) Come on -- I told your father I'd have you home by ten. 
Karen grins. Just then... 
A TRANSFORMER 
Karen grabs Tom's arm and Tom gets a hold of the windowsill and pulls himself up. 
KENNY 
Grabs onto... 
THE TV ANTENNA 
And starts pulling himself out of the water. 
THE TRANSFORMER 
Explodes. 
KENNY 
Feels pretty pleased with himself until... 
THE TV ANTENNA 
Starts dancing with electricity and... 
KENNY 
Is hit by the voltage and his teeth clamp shut and his body goes rigid and his clothes explode in flames. 
TOM AND KAREN 
Look away. 
THE WATER 
Dead fish start floating to the surface. 
KENNY 
Is fried, smoking. He falls off the TV antenna and hits the water with a loud and ugly hiss. He floats away, his body shaking spasmodically. 
TOM AND KAREN 
Tom hears an engine approaching. He looks around, then smashes the window with his elbow. 
INT. HOUSE 
The window glass tumbles in. Tom reaches in, undoes the latch and slides up the window. He climbs in, straddling the window sill. The camera moves down Tom's leg to show... 
A WOLF TRAP 
Laying on the floor, just below the window. 
TOM 
Is oblivious. He starts to put his foot down into the trap. Just then he knocks... 
A POTTED CACTUS 
Off the windowsill. It falls straight down into... 
THE WOLF TRAP 
Hitting the trigger. The jaws snap, obliterating the cactus. 
TOM Jesus Christ! 
A SHOTGUN BARREL 
Snaps into view, pointing right at Tom's head. 
WOMAN (O.S.) You so much as breathe funny and your head is going back out that window without you. 
EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET 
Jim drives the boat down the street. Mr. Mehlor is scanning the water with a flashlight. 
MR. MEHLOR Jim! Over there! 
Jim looks over to see... 
THE JET-SKI 
Floating in the water. And not far from it is... 
KENNY 
Still twitching. 
OMITTED 
Sequence omitted from original script. 
INT. HOUSE - BEDROOM 
Doreen holds the shotgun on Tom and Karen as they move away from the window, hands raised. 
DOREEN Real slow now. Like you were in a big jar of molasses. That's it. 
They hear footsteps coming down old wood stairs. 
MAN (O.S.) Doreen? You haven't killed anybody, have you? 
DOREEN I've got everything under control, Henry. You go back up. 
Henry enters. 
HENRY Jesus, Doreen, you caught a whole gang. 
EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET 
The Sheriff sits in his boat, moored to the wall of sandbags around the church. Wayne's boat is tied up next to it. The floodwater is trickling over the top of the wall. The gas- powered pumps inside the wall are keeping the waters at bay. 
WAYNE AND PHIL 
Come out of the front doors of the church. 
WAYNE They're not here. 
EXT. ROAD OUT OF TOWN - WELCOME SIGN 
Tom rows up to the truck and "Welcome" sign. His flashlight shows just the top of the truck and sign. Tom looks at his watch, ties the rowboat to the sign, jumps into the water. 
A few moments pass, then Tom surfaces, holding a shotgun. Then he senses something behind him and turns to see... 
A COW 
Floating in the water, tongue out, eyes glassy. 
TOM 
Kicks away, horrified. And then he hears an engine. He looks. 
TOM'S POV 
Jim's ski-boat is coming over the water. The engine cuts out and the ski-boat drifts, a hundred feet from Tom. 
JIM (yelling) Son, before you go underwater and do something tricky, there's something I'd like you to see! 
A flashlight comes on, the beam swivels, illuminating... 
HENRY AND DOREEN 
Standing in the ski-boat, blinking in the light. 
TOM 
Slumps. 
JIM Now, I know it's your job to protect that money, and maybe you'd even be foolish enough to give your life for it. The question is, are you willing to give their lives for it? 
Jim puts a pistol to Doreen's head. 
JIM Drop the gun and get into the boat. 
TOM 
Thinks for a second, then throws the shotgun away and pulls himself into the rowboat. 
JIM Excellent choice. 
TOM, JIM, HENRY AND DOREEN 
As Tom and Jim call to each other across the water, Doreen goes at Henry. 
TOM I'll take you to the money, but you gotta let them go. 
DOREEN I hope you're proud of yourself, Henry Sears. 
HENRY Shh. 
JIM I think it'd be best if -- 
DOREEN I told you not to give him the goddamn boat. 
HENRY Doreen, please. 
JIM I think it'd be best if we all stayed together. 
TOM You say all you want is the money? Prove it. Let them go. 
JIM I don't know if that's -- 
DOREEN We could be safe in our home instead of out here in a boat with these low- life scumbags! 
JIM (after a look at Doreen, nods to Mr. Mehlor) Let 'em go. 
EXT. MAIN STREET 
The Sheriff, Wayne and Phil motor past the statue. Wayne is driving his boat; Phil is with the Sheriff. The water is up to the General's neck. 
EXT. ROAD OUT OF TOWN 
Tom helps Henry and Doreen over into the rowboat. As he does, his face comes close to Henry's for a second. 
TOM (whisper) Karen? 
HENRY (shakes head, whispers) In the attic. They never saw her. 
EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET 
Karen swims down the center of the street. 
EXT. ROAD OUT OF TOWN 
Tom is in the ski-boat with Jim. He looks out at... 
HENRY AND DOREEN 
As Henry rows them off into the darkness. 
DOREEN (disappearing in dark) Faster, Henry! The bastards might change their minds! Stop lily- dipping and move it! 
Henry starts to turn the boat around. 
DOREEN What're you doing? 
HENRY I'm gonna row back there and see if he'll shoot you. Or me. Fine either way. 
SHERIFF Hank, remember when Mike Crane holed up in Jack Finch's barn and said he was gonna burn it down? 
CROSSCUT WITH HANK 
HANK Hey, I was the one who got the dumb son-of-a-bitch to come out. 
SHERIFF Right. And before you went in, I deputized you, you dumb son-of-a- bitch! So when I say get down here, it's not a request, it's an order. So get down here! Now! I won't need you for long. And bring your gun. 
EXT. CEMETERY 
JIM We were gonna hit you just before you got on the Interstate, but then you got stuck so we had to change our plans and take you -- 
TOM Bullshit. This is all bullshit. 
JIM I knew Charlie when we were both working construction for the Johnstown company. His middle name was McCarthy because his parents loved Charlie McCarthy on the radio. His wife's name was Mary. She died of a heart- attack last year. He has a daughter and a son, both grown with children of their own. I'm afraid I don't know the names of the grandchildren. 
Tom looks down, not wanting to believe. 
JIM What else do I know...? Oh, yes. I know Uncle Charlie was trying to steer his favorite nephew away from a life of crime. 
Tom suddenly lunges for Jim. Ray yanks Tom back. 
TOM Why'd you shoot him? Kill Charlie and you get to keep another share? 
JIM No, That was an accident. Ken shot him. (eyes Kenny sadly) I never told him Charlie was on my side. Ken liked to talk. (shakes head) He shouldn't've been here. But his dad asked me to watch over him. I guess I didn't do the best job. 
RAY Excuse me, Jim. I hate to interrupt and all, but could we just get the money and get the hell out of here? 
JIM (nods; to Tom) I'm gonna ask you one more time. And before you think of bullshitting me again, keep in mind I have had a very frustrating night. And while I know I'll never get the money if I kill you, it's getting to the point where I just don't care. 
Jim casually aims his gun at Tom. 
TOM I'll tell you where it is. But it's not going to do you any good. 
Jim arches an eyebrow. 
TOM The Guard may not be coming, but someone else sure as hell is. 
EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN THE SHERIFF 
At the controls of his boat, moving fast, sprayed by rain. Karen and Phil are in the back of the boat. Wayne is close behind in his boat. 
EXT. CEMETERY 
JIM I'll take my chances. 
Tom pauses, looks over to... 
THE CRYPT 
Just the top of it is visible. Two more COFFINS float nearby. 
TOM There. 
Jim steers the ski-boat over, hands Tom a flashlight. 
JIM Well, go get it. 
Tom climbs over the edge of the ski-boat and into the water. He turns on the flashlight and drops below the surface. 
RAY (eyeing Tom in water) "At night we'd go down to the river and into the river we'd dive." (off Jim and Mehlor's looks) Springsteen, "The River." I'm all out of bible quotes. 
UNDERWATER 
Tom shines his light on... 
THE CRYPT 
One end of a rope is tied to the crypt. The other end, cut and frayed, is suspended in the water, waving in the current. 
ON THE WATER 
Jim watches Tom's light rise. Tom comes up fast, takes a breath. 
TOM It's gone. 
JIM What? 
TOM (smug) Looks like somebody beat you to it. 
RAY Oh for Christs -- I'm gonna shoot him, Jim. 
Ray grabs pistol in his belt. Before he can pull it out, holes puff out of his chest, followed by blood and then the sound of the rifle-shots. Ray tumbles into the water. A half- second later there's... 
HAIL OF BULLETS 
Ripping into the ski-boat, water, trees, crypt. 
THE SHERIFF'S BOAT, WAYNE'S BOAT 
Are outside the fence, a hundred feet from the crypt. PUSH IN FAST on... 
THE SHERIFF 
To the rescue. He and Wayne and Phil fire their guns. 
TOM 
Ducks underwater. 
JIM 
Pulls his pistol, returns fire. 
MR. MEHLOR 
Opens fire with a shotgun, shooting wild, yelling. Then he's hit and knocked out of the boat, dead. 
THE WATER 
Erupts in a huge geyser. 
THE SHERIFF, WAYNE, PHIL AND HANK 
Are knocked off their feet. The Sheriff, Phil and Hank are thrown into the water. Their boats are rocked up and back and swamped with falling water. 
JIM 
Fires up his engine. 
TOM 
Is almost to the boat. 
WAYNE 
Gets to his knees in his boat and starts shooting. 
TOM 
Gets to Jim's boat and grabs onto it. 
JIM 
Cranks the throttle, and, dragging Tom, tears off under the hail of Wayne's bullets. 
TOM'S POV 
As Jim races through the tombstones, barely missing halfsubmerged stone crosses and crypt roofs. 
TOM 
Rams into one cross. 
HIS HANDS 
Start to slip from the boat. 
JIM 
Grabs Tom's hand and holds on as they shoot off across the water. 
THE SHERIFF, PHIL AND HANK 
Get back in the boats. 
EXT. ON THE WATER - MOVING 
Jim hauls Tom into the boat. Tom lays on the bottom, catching his breath. Blood is dripping down from his arm. 
TOM (beat, looks up at Jim) You really want that money? 
Jim gives Tom a look -- of course he wants that money. 
TOM 'Cause the only way you're ever gonna see it is if you help me get Karen. 
Before Jim can answer, gunshots ring out behind them. They look back to see... 
THE SHERIFF AND HIS MEN 
Coming after them in the three boats, shooting, closing. 
TOM We're too slow. 
JIM (thinks, then:) Here. 
Jim moves away from the wheel, giving it to Tom. Tom gets up and takes over. Jim bends and picks up... 
KENNY 
Lifeless and limp. 
JIM 
Looks at Kenny for a moment, then pushes his body overboard. 
WITH THE SHERIFF AND HIS MEN 
Flying over the water. 
THEIR POV 
They see a body tumble out of the ski-boat. 
WITH JIM AND TOM 
Jim looks back, following Kenny with his eyes. 
EXT. MAIN STREET 
Jim and Tom make the turn onto Main Street. They look back as... 
THE SHERIFF AND HIS MEN 
Come around the corner, two hundred yards back. 
TOM They're not going to catch us now. 
LOW ANGLE 
Of the ski-boat, racing toward camera. As it gets closer, the camera BOOMS DOWN underwater to reveal... 
THE STATUE 
The sword tip just below the surface. THE SKI-BOAT 
JIM Does he have the girl? 
TOM (shakes head) She's in the small boat. 
Tom touches the wound on his head. 
TOM Jesus, I'm gonna get hepatitis. 
JIM Hepatitis, hell. You probably already got cholera. 
Tom gives Jim a look then starts for the back of the church. 
JIM What're you doing? 
TOM There's a back room. (touches wound) Maybe they've got something I can use on this. 
JIM You been in here before? 
TOM (bad memory) Oh, yeah. 
JIM What happened? 
TOM I saw Jesus. 
EXT. DAM 
Water is starting to go over the top again. It pours down in sheets over the face of the dam. 
INT. CHURCH 
Jim is by the window, looking out at the Sheriff and Wayne across the street in the shadows. He turns as... 
TOM 
Enters from the back. He's got a bottle of rubbing alcohol and a towel. He splashes some of the alcohol on the towel, then touches it to his wound. It hurts like a sonofabitch. After a beat... 
TOM So, has this all gone pretty much how you thought it would? 
Jim turns on Tom. 
JIM Everything would have gone fine if you'd've just walked away from the truck. 
TOM Oh, yeah? Well, everything would've gone even better if you hadn't decided to rob the damn truck in the first place! 
Jim looks away. After another silence... 
TOM Did Charlie have cancer or something? 
JIM You mean why was he doing this? (thinks, shrugs) No cancer. (beat) Didn't you ever think about taking the money? 
TOM No. 
JIM Come now. A man who used to make his living fencing hot jackhammers never thought about what he'd do with three million dollars? 
TOM Sorry to disappoint you. (beat) What are you gonna do with it? 
JIM As little as possible. 
Silence for a few moments, then... 
TOM Belize. 
Jim looks at him. 
TOM It's this small country in Central America, on the Atlantic side. 
JIM I know where Belize is. What about it? 
TOM They speak English and the dollar goes a long way. Beautiful beaches; friendly people. And they've got liberal banking laws. Very liberal. 
JIM No, you didn't think about taking that money at all. 
TOM (busted) You can't ride in the truck and not think about it. 
JIM I'm sure. And I guess that's pretty much how it started with Charlie. 
Tom thinks, nods and presses the towel to his wound again. 
EXT. MAIN STREET 
Wayne is thinking about something. He makes a decision and flicks on his engine. 
SHERIFF What're you doing? 
WAYNE We got too many bodies with bullets in 'em. (nods at Karen) I'm gonna put her in her house, make it look like she fell down the stairs and drowned. 
PHIL Don't you touch her! 
WAYNE Saving her life... Hmm... You know, that might have actually gotten you laid. 
SHERIFF Oh, for Christsakes, just dump her here. 
WAYNE We got a few minutes before Hank gets back. 
SHERIFF Just dump her here! 
Wayne ignores the Sheriff and motors off. 
SHERIFF Wayne! Goddamnit, we've gotta get them outta there! Wayne! 
But Wayne keeps going. 
INT. CHURCH 
Tom watches Wayne drive off with Karen. 
TOM Shit. Where's he going? 
THE OVERHEAD LIGHT 
Sparks and goes out. 
WAYNE (looks up at light) That won't do. Man's gotta see what he's doing. 'Scuse me. 
Wayne heads off for the kitchen. The second he's gone... 
KAREN 
Raises her hips and digs a hand into her pocket and pulls out her Swiss Army knife. She pries open the big blade. She hears Wayne sloshing back toward her. She gets back into the position Wayne left her in as... 
WAYNE 
Re-enters carrying two burning candles in candle-holders. 
WAYNE I got the candles. All's we need is a cake. 
He sets the candles down on a dry step above Karen's head. He leans in close. 
WAYNE Mood lighting. You in the mood yet? (no answer from Karen; back into Penthouse letter) And then she said, "My present's ready and waiting. All's you gotta do is unwrap it." 
Wayne reaches into the water, undoes Karen's rain pants, yanks off her shoes, then pulls off her pants. He throws them over the banister. Karen remains passive, blank. Wayne takes off his holster; hangs it on the banister. Then he pushes his pants down to his ankles. His shirttail is long enough so that we don't have to see his wretched little pecker. He climbs on top of Karen in the water, brings his face close to hers. 
WAYNE It was cold and rainy that birthday night, and all I wanted was to get someplace warm and dry. As it turned out, what I really wanted was something warm and wet. Wayne grins and closes for a kiss and... 
KAREN'S HAND 
Moves fast with the knife and... 
WAYNE'S EYES 
Pop open wide. 
WAYNE 
His head jerks back. He tries to shout, but all that comes out is an awful gurgle. He tries to push off Karen, but... 
KAREN 
Wraps her legs around him, holds him close, pinning him. 
WAYNE 
Finally breaks free. He tries to stop the bleeding with a hand, but the blood spurts through his fingers. He reaches for his gun in his holster on the banister, but just as he grabs it... 
KAREN 
Lashes out of the water with her legs, kicking Wayne in the groin, pushing him back. 
WAYNE 
Tries to get his balance, but his feet can't move -- his pants are around his ankles. He falls back into the water, firing his pistol. 
BULLETS 
Blow chunks out of the wall next to Karen, hit the ceiling and... 
WAYNE 
Is floating on his back, trying to lift the pistol, but his strength is fading fast. He gets off one last shot and... 
THE CANDLE 
Nearest Karen is blown to pieces. 
WAYNE 
The gun drops into the water. No more shots. No more life. He floats, pants around his ankles, covered in blood, dead. 
KAREN Happy Birthday, Wayne. 
EXT. STREET AND CHURCH 
The church roof is on fire. 
THE SHERIFF, PHIL AND HANK 
Are across the street. 
INT. CHURCH 
Jim and Tom hear a creaking and look up. 
THE CEILING 
The fire has eaten holes in the roof. Embers come down. 
EXT. CHURCH AND STREET 
The Sheriff is getting very agitated. 
SHERIFF They're not coming out, Hank! 
HANK The fire's not catching. The rain's too -- 
SHERIFF We have to get them! We have to kill them! Do you understand? If they're not dead, we got jack shit! 
INT. CHURCH 
A small chunk of burning ceiling drops down. Jim and Tom look up. Just then... 
BRIGHT LIGHT 
Floods into the church through... 
THE STAINED GLASS WINDOWS 
BLAZING TIMBERS 
Start to fall from the burning roof frame, hitting the water with loud sizzling hisses. 
THE SHERIFF, PHIL AND HANK 
Turn to shoot at tom through the dropping flaming debris. 
TOM 
Disappears up the stairs, the bullets just missing him. 
UNDERWATER 
Jim runs out of bullets. He's long since run out of air. He drops his guns and swims under the pews. 
HANK 
Looks up, realizing that Tom will be able to shoot down on him. He reverses his boat fast under the balcony as... 
TOM 
Shoots down from the balcony, blowing a chunk out of the prow of Hank's boat. 
INT. KAREN'S HOUSE 
The water is up to Karen's chin. Her hands are working frantically beneath the water. 
UNDERWATER 
She's using the tip of the knife blade to unscrew the screws holding the support to the railing. She's on the last one. The blade slips, misses, gets a quarter turn, another quarter turn... 
KAREN 
Spits out the water that spills into her mouth. 
UNDERWATER 
Another quarter-turn and the screw is loose enough to turn by hand. 
KAREN 
Holds her breath with the water touching her nose. She gets the screw loose, pulls up on the railing and pulls the handcuff through the gap between the support and the railing. 
INT. CHURCH 
The Sheriff turns to Phil and nods re: Jim. 
SHERIFF You take care of him! 
The Sheriff aims at the balcony as Phil scans the water, looking for Jim. 
UNDERWATER 
Jim pulls an electrical cord out of a wall socket. 
ON THE BALCONY 
Tom ducks down as the Sheriff's bullets start plugging through the wood front of the balcony. Tom moves away from the bullet strikes, splashing through the water in the balcony. 
CLOSE ON BALCONY FLOOR 
As BANG BANG BANG -- bullets start shooting up from below. 
HANK 
Is firing up at Tom through the floor of the balcony. 
TOM 
Jumps back, startled, looking down at... 
THE BALCONY FLOOR 
Holes explode in the floor, sending up small geysers of water. The water then starts whirlpooling down through the holes. 
TOM 
Moves back from hank's advancing bullet holes. 
THE SHERIFF 
Keeps firing. 
TOM 
Is caught between Hank's bullets and the Sheriff's bullets. So he racks a load in the shotgun and dives backwards off the balcony. 
HANK 
Is still shooting up as... 
TOM 
Arcs off the balcony, firing the shotgun under the balcony at Hank. 
HANK 
Dives to the floor of his boat as Tom's shotgun blasts blow plate-sized holes in the church doors. 
TOM 
Lands in the water and goes under. 
THE SHERIFF AND PHIL 
Look for Tom in the water. 
KAREN 
Tugs at the railing, tries rocking it up and down. It doesn't budge. She starts chipping at the plaster with the knife. 
KAREN God, I am really beginning to hate fine craftsmanship. 
THE WATER 
It's up to her chest. 
INT. CHURCH 
The Sheriff hesitates. 
TOM Where is she? 
SHERIFF They went back to her house. 
TOM Where's her house? 
SHERIFF It's -- 
And just then they all hear something truly ominous -- a siren pierces the night. 
INT. KAREN'S HOUSE 
She reacts to the siren -- uh-oh. 
INT. CHURCH 
The siren wails. 
JIM What in God's name is that? 
SHERIFF Hank? 
HANK (woozy but okay) It's topped out. 
SHERIFF How much time we got? 
HANK How should I know? 
SHERIFF Guess! 
HANK It's an old dam! Not long. 
SHERIFF (to Tom) Then I'd say you boys better drop your guns. 
TOM What? 
SHERIFF That's the deal! You let me and Hank go -- with a few of these bags -- and I'll tell you where to find Karen. 
JIM (to the Sheriff) Get out of the boat. 
TOM Hold on. 
Jim turns to look at Tom. 
JIM Hold on? 
SHERIFF It's the only way you're gonna find her! 
TOM It's only a couple of bags. 
JIM No. 
TOM But I thought -- 
JIM Look, I don't know what you thought but I told you, I'm here for the money; that's all. 
Tom doesn't know what to do. The Sheriff looks pretty pleased with himself. He might just get out of this. And then... 
PHIL (O.S.) She lives on Boyd Street. 
They all look over at... 
PHIL 
Alive, but barely. 
PHIL Three over. Two-story, blue shutters. 
TOM 
Looks at Jim, disappointed, angry, then hurries to Hank's boat. 
JIM 
Climbs into the Sheriff's boat. 
TOM 
Climbs into Hank's boat. He starts the engine, looks down at... 
PHIL 
Floating in the water, dying. A brief look between them, then... 
TOM 
Drives the boat out through a shattered window. 
JIM 
Pushes the Sheriff out of the boat. 
EXT. RESERVOIR DAM

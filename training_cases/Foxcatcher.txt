FOXCATCHER

E. Max Frye & Dan Futterman 
INT. UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN GYM - VERY EARLY MORNING 
MARK SCHULTZ (27, 180 lbs., cauliflower ears) lifts a human- sized, leather WRESTLING DUMMY from the mat to stand in front of him. He performs a series of repetitive moves - hooking one arm under the dummy's arm, then the other; one side, then other. Again and again. It looks almost as if he's dancing gently with it. 
Then, very fast, Mark spins quickly around behind the dummy, grabs it in a bear hug, arches his back, lifts and SLAMS it to the mat, landing on top. 
QUICK CUTS: Mark spinning, lifting and slamming the dummy - first one way, then the other - first one hold, then another - SLAM. SLAM. SLAM. SLAM. SLAM - over and over and over again. 
CUT TO: 
I/E. BARABOO SCHOOL/PARKING LOT - LATE MORNING 
Mark pulls his beat-up car into a space in the parking lot of this nondescript, 1960s-era suburban brick-facade school. He's freshly showered, wears a short-sleeve dress shirt, clip- on tie, slacks. He reaches behind the front seat and pulls out a battered BROWN VINYL BRIEFCASE. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BARABOO SCHOOL/PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE WAITING ROOM - DAY 
Mark waits alone in a chair he's much too big for, his brown vinyl briefcase on his lap. A portrait of President Reagan hangs on the painted cinder block wall. A clock ticks. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BARABOO SCHOOL/AUDITORIUM - DAY 
Mark's on stage. An audience of 4th, 5th and 6th graders. 
MARK Why do I do it? Why do I push myself to my limits - of pain, of exhaustion - every day of my life? Why do I wake up every morning and make the commitment? Why do I do it? 
The students are open-mouthed - they have no idea what to make of him. Mark's not being willfully over-the-top with these kids. This is just what's on his mind. All the time. 
MARK (CONT'D) In 13 months - if I train right, if I push myself - I'll be going to Seoul - that's a city in South Korea. Does anyone know why? Because that's where the Olympic games are. 
Mark reaches into the briefcase at his feet and pulls out a RIBBON with a MEDAL dangling from it. 
MARK (CONT'D) Does anyone know what this is? 
As a couple of kids start to raise their hands -- 
MARK (CONT'D) Olympic gold medal. I won it three years ago at the `84 Games in Los Angeles. My brother, Dave Schultz - my best friend, my older brother, my best friend - won one too, just 23 hours and 16 minutes before I did. That's unprecedented - two brothers winning at the same Olympics. (THEN) Would you like me to win another one? Would you like me to win another gold medal - for us, for America? Would you like to see me and my big brother - Dave Schultz - both win gold medals? Who here wants to see the two brothers win again? 
Silence. A couple of the kids tentatively raise their hands. The rest are completely frozen. 
MARK (CONT'D) Well we're going to give it absolutely everything we've got. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BARABOO SCHOOL/PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE WAITING ROOM - DAY 
A SCHOOL SECRETARY writes out a check as Mark stands in front of the desk, placing his medal back in his briefcase. 
SCHOOL SECRETARY Twenty... and... no one-hundreds... 
She tears off the check and hands it to Mark. He takes the check, holds out to her a SIGNED 8x10 PHOTO of himself with his arms raised, in a USA WRESTLING SINGLET just after winning his Olympic gold. 
MARK And this is for the trophy case. 
SCHOOL SECRETARY I'm sorry?... For what? 
MARK For the trophy case. (BEAT) With the trophies. 
SCHOOL SECRETARY It's an elementary school. 
As Mark holds out the photo, WE HEAR: 
FAST FOOD KID (V.O.) Can I take your order? 
CUT TO: 
INT. ARBY'S - DAY 
A long-haired, greasy KID with the very beginnings of a mustache takes Mark's order. Mark looks up at the menu sign. 
MARK I'll have a # 4. 
Mark, the phone tucked against his shoulder, slips a BLANK TAPE into a cheap VCR. He slides a HAND-LABELED TAPE into a second VCR, wired to the first. We can read the label: "THE MARK SCHULTZ WRESTLING CLINIC." He starts making a copy. 
MARK (ON PHONE) (CONT'D) I'm arranging a clinic in your area next weekend, and I wanted to invite you and some of your wrestlers to join... 
JUMP CUT TO: 
MARK (ON PHONE) (CONT'D) That's Dave, my brother. I wrestle at 180... No, he won't be there, just me... Okay - well, good luck with your season, coach. 
JUMP TO: 
On the screen is a montage of highlights from Mark's career: take downs, pins. He's an animal - powerful, aggressive. 
MARK (ON PHONE) (CONT'D) Yes, there's a small fee. 
JUMP TO: 
MARK (ON PHONE) (CONT'D) S-C-H-U-L-T-Z.... 
JUMP TO: 
On the screen, Mark wrestles Resit Karabajak, a Turkish wrestler, in his first round match at the `84 Olympics. 
MARK (ON PHONE) (CONT'D) A unique, character-building opportunity for young wrestlers.... Yes, a small fee... 
Mark throws Karabajak to the mat. Pins him. Walks away, arms raised. Crowd cheers. Karabajak's on the mat, hurt. 
MARK (ON PHONE) (CONT'D) Dave's my brother... 
On screen, Mark does a back flip. 
JUMP TO: 
MARK (ON PHONE) (CONT'D) Olympic Champion... 
Mark does a back flip. 
MARK (ON PHONE) (CONT'D) Dave's my brother... 
JUMP TO: 
Mark's holds the phone on his lap, just watching himself on the screen, wrestling... winning... match after match... 
EXT. MARK'S APARTMENT/OUTSIDE WALKWAY - EVENING 
Mark's outside at the second floor railing of this two-story stucco building, looking out over the bleak landscape: a 7- 11, an Auto-Zone. He eats a hard-boiled egg. He watches a CAR pull into the lot below. Dave gets out, looks up. 
DAVE Where were you today? 
CUT TO: 
INT. MARK'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER 
Dave fills two mismatched glasses with tap water from the faucet. 
DAVE How far'd you run? Ten? 
Mark's on the tattered couch. He shrugs, though we should see that he loves the fact that Dave is concerned about him. 
DAVE (CONT'D) More than ten? Dragging weight the whole way? (Dave turns off the water) You're a sick fuck, you know that? 
Dave turns to look at Mark, sitting in the bare living room. 
DAVE (CONT'D) Place is looking good, by the way. I like what you've done with it. 
Dave notices the Public Schools Directory on the table. 
DAVE (CONT'D) You setting up clinics? 
MARK Talked to some coaches. 
Dave comes toward Mark, handing off a water glass, dragging the folding chair over to sit across from him. 
DAVE I hope you don't have anything booked for Saturday. 
MARK Why? 
DAVE I need a favor. This school called me months ago to do a gig but now I can't. Nancy's got a thing all day so I gotta watch the kids. You free? 
MARK I'll check. 
INT. DAVE'S CAR/OUTSIDE MARK'S APARTMENT - EVENING 
Mark looks out the window. Silence. They sit there, both bruised and bloodied. 
MARK Sorry about your nose. 
DAVE No, you're not. (BEAT) Come by the house, have dinner with me and Nance and the kids. 
Mark's still looking out the window. He speaks quietly - 
MARK You win a gold medal for them. And still. Nothing. No respect. 
He reaches for the door handle. 
DAVE Hey. Gimme a hug. 
Dave reaches for his arm, and Mark folds automatically into his older brother, puts his head on his chest. Dave embraces him for several long moments - it's like a father and his young child. Then Dave smacks him on the back of the neck. 
DAVE (CONT'D) Same time tomorrow. 
Mark nods, gets out of the car and walks away. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MARK'S APARTMENT - EVENING 
Mark presses PLAY on his answering machine. Hang-ups and DIAL TONES. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MARK'S APARTMENT/BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Mark examines his bruised face in the mirror, wiping away blood - some of it his, some his brother's. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MARK'S APARTMENT - LATER 
Mark's at the refrigerator, cracking ice cube trays into a plastic 7-11 shopping bag. The PHONE RINGS. He picks up -- 
MARK (ON PHONE) Yah. 
A man's voice is heard. It sounds like long distance. 
MAN (OVER PHONE) May I please speak with Mr. Mark Schultz? 
MARK (ON PHONE) It's Mark. 
MAN (OVER PHONE) I'm sorry to call you at night, but Mr. du Pont was anxious that I get in touch with you. 
MARK (ON PHONE) Okay... 
MAN (ON PHONE) He asked that you please consider taking a day off from your training to come out to Foxcatcher Farms so you men can meet face to face. 
MARK (ON PHONE) Who do you work for again? 
MAN (ON PHONE) John E. du Pont of the du Pont family of Newtown Square, Pennsylvania. (BEAT) You may also know of him in connection with his support of the Villanova wrestling program. 
MARK (ON PHONE) (HE DOESN'T) What does he want to talk about? 
MAN (ON PHONE) Mr. du Pont requested that I contact you to set up a meeting. He'd like to bring you out to Pennsylvania. 
MARK (ON PHONE) Uh-huh. 
MAN (ON PHONE) If I may I'd like to make travel arrangements for you, Mr. Schultz. 
Mark's holding the ice cube tray, alone in his dingy kitchen. 
MAN (ON PHONE) (CONT'D) Mr. Schultz? 
CUT TO: 
INT. PHL AIRPORT/ARRIVAL GATE - DAY 
BRANDON (20s, post-prep school, jacket/tie) waits for Mark. 
BRANDON Mr. Schultz, I'm Brandon. Welcome to Philadelphia. 
CUT TO: 
MARK Oh. Well. I take the mornings on my own - as you said, strength training, endurance - then I meet up with my brother - you know Dave Schultz - ? 
DU PONT Of course, of course, yes, I know him. I mean, not personally, but yes, of course, I do know him. 
MARK - I meet up with him at the U-W gym, we work out whatever free time we can grab between team practice. 
DU PONT University of Wisconsin. 
MARK Yes sir. 
DU PONT Where you both coach. 
Mark NODS vaguely. 
DU PONT (CONT'D) And they provide you with everything you need? 
Beat. 
MARK Pretty much. 
A moment as du Pont watches Mark. 
DU PONT I'd like to see you win this upcoming tournament - 
MARK - Thank you - 
DU PONT - I'd like to help you win this upcoming tournament. It's a big one, yes? 
MARK It's the world championship. 
Du Pont nods. 
DU PONT Why do you do it, Mark? 
Mark just looks at him, unsure what he's being asked. 
DU PONT (CONT'D) Why? 
MARK (simply no other reason) I want to be the best in the world. 
DU PONT I want you to be the best in the world. I want this country to be the best in the world. (THEN) May I speak frankly? 
Mark nods... of course. 
DU PONT (CONT'D) I'm concerned. I'm concerned by what I see in these Unites States. Athletes labor to bring honor to America, and America fails to honor that labor. Fails to honor it and fails to support it. 
Mark's staring at du Pont intently. 
DU PONT (CONT'D) When did you win your first match? 
MARK I started kind of late - high school sophomore. 
Du Pont waits, listening... 
MARK (CONT'D) I was... well, truthfully, I was... kind of lost. And I got into it `cause my brother was wrestling. He convinced me to give it a try. I never told him this, but I was scared of losing in front of him. So of course my first match I get put up against a kid two years older. Dave was helping coach from my corner... and at the end, when the ref raised my hand... (MORE) 
MARK (CONT'D) there was my brother, he was running towards me - screaming - laughing - he lifted me up -- 
Mark stops - face flushed - tries to stop himself from getting CHOKED UP. After a few moments, he speaks quietly: 
MARK (CONT'D) It's always been his sport. He let me inside. I'm just lucky to be very very good at it. 
DU PONT You won that match. Not him. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. FOXCATCHER ESTATE - DAY 
Du Pont and Mark walk the last few steps of a huge lawn up to an OLD FIELD HOUSE in the final stages of renovation. Du Pont opens the door. They walk into a gleaming new GYM. 
CUT TO: 
INT. FOXCATCHER GYM - CONTINUOUS 
Four pristine WRESTLING MATS are spread out on the floor. Through a doorway on the far end we can glimpse a WEIGHT ROOM with new nautilus and stationary bikes and free weights. 
DU PONT The U.S. Olympic Committee refuses to recognize that training for international competition is a full time job. Why is that? Why is that? (looks at Mark) I want you all to have a home. 
CUT TO: 
MARK Why does she... 
He trails off. Then, a bit desperate - 
MARK (CONT'D) The deer hunting on his farm's supposed to be amazing... 
Dave speaks gently. 
DAVE I got a good thing going here. I got a contract. Nancy's happy, Alex likes his school... 
The reality starts to hit Mark that he may be doing this alone, without his older brother. He's shell-shocked. 
MARK The Worlds are sixty days away. 
DAVE Tell me your plan. Who you gonna train with? 
MARK (LOST) Du Pont's taking his money out of the Villanova program. They'll pull the plug on that. So. Dan Bane could come. I - I guess Dan Bane. (beat, then, very quietly) I don't know how to do this without you. 
DAVE Do what? 
The answer is "everything" -- but Mark just shakes his head. 
DAVE (CONT'D) It sounds like an opportunity. 
MARK Does it? 
DAVE I think you could make something of it. 
MARK Do you? (DAVE NODS) A spot's always open for you if you decide to come. 
DAVE Thank you. 
Dave steps forward and holds out his arms - 
DAVE (CONT'D) Congrats, little brother. 
Mark steps into his brother's arms, folding into him, head on his chest, holding on for dear life. Nancy looks over. 
CUT TO: 
I/E. MARK'S APARTMENT - MORNING 
Mark packs his apartment - trashing just about everything, tossing it in the dumpster - stuffing the few essentials in his AMC GREMLIN. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. DRIVING - DAY 
Mark drives across Ohio. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. FILLING STATION - DAY 
Mark gets gas. The attendant - clearly a HIGH SCHOOL WRESTLER - shakes his hand. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. FOXCATCHER ESTATE - DAY 
Mark pulls onto the estate grounds. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. FRONT DOOR/BIG HOUSE - DAY 
Mark rings the doorbell. No answer. He goes to ring it again and the door is opened by a UNIFORMED MAID. 
MARK Hi. I'm Mark Schultz. 
Silence. That means nothing to her. 
MARK (CONT'D) I'm here to see John du Pont? 
UNIFORMED MAID Is Mr. du Pont expecting you? 
MARK Yeah. Well - not today exactly, but, yes. This week. Sometime. 
UNIFORMED MAID Just a moment, please. 
On the two men standing in the porch light. PRELAP the sound of POUNDING FEET, getting louder and louder - 
CUT TO: 
INT. FOXCATCHER GYM - SEVERAL WEEKS LATER/DAY 
CLOSE ON: Wrestling shoes running FAST in place on the gym mat. There are SIX SETS of feet in a wide circle. Team Foxcatcher is beginning to come together. 
MARK Drop! 
All six wrestlers, Mark included, drop to the mats for 10 fast push-ups and sit-ups. 
The wrestlers are: ROBERTO GARCIA, aka "GECKO" (21 years old, 105 pounds, Latino, as fast a talker as he is a wrestler); JIM ZEREGA - "JIMMY Z" (24, 114 lbs., blond Midwesterner); MATT POPPER (24, 149 lbs., East coast working class); BRUCE SPRINGER (27, also 149 lbs., half Asian); MARK SCHULTZ (180 lbs.); and DAN BANE (30, 198 lbs., strong and low-key, intelligent, from the West, like Mark.) 
The wrestlers jump up - run in place incredibly fast. 
MARK (CONT'D) DROP - 
JUMP CUT TO: 
Garcia and Zerega sprint to the end of the mats and back. Relay shuttles, each pair races, then the next pair. 
Popper and Springer have just run (probably for the twentieth time) - they're BENT OVER, sucking wind by the wall. 
Du Pont WALKS IN. He wears a sweatsuit, has a whistle around his neck. He hovers a slight distance away, observing, seeming to want to be noticed. 
Mark and Dan take off, racing, as Garcia beats Zerega - 
Du Pont stares at Garcia. As Dan and Mark race back, Dan notices du Pont - 
DAN Hey, Coach. 
Du Pont becomes at once an odd combination of a kid invited to join in and the actual boss and benefactor of this team. 
DU PONT Dan Bane. How's that hamstring? 
DAN Coming back. It's coming back. 
DU PONT Good. Good to hear. Hamstring coming back. 
MARK (walking up to him) Sir, you need me for something? 
DU PONT No no. Later. Please. Continue. 
MARK (nods, turns back) Pair up. On the mat. Up and down. Popper, Springer, let's go. 
Springer's dragging a bit, clearly wiped out. 
GARCIA Spling Loll - must lay off the pohk flied lice. 
SPRINGER (EXHAUSTED) Suck me, Gecko. (as he comes onto the mat) And I'm fucking Filipino, dickhead. 
The six wrestlers are paired and spread out on the mats - each pair in the up-down position. 
MARK Go! 
They all go to it - the top wrestler trying to get a hold secure enough to turn the other - and the down wrestler splayed on the mat, fending him off. 
Du Pont hovers nearby, watching intently. We can sense his fascination - his admiration for these athletes. Also, his jealousy - how desperately he'd love to be part of this brotherhood.... He CLAPS, like a coach would.... 
DU PONT (awkward, not loud enough) Good. (CLAPS AGAIN) Good. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. FOXCATCHER ESTATE - LATE AFTERNOON 
Mark, freshly showered, walks across the yard from the field house gym to the Big House. 
CUT TO: 
INT. DU PONT'S OFFICE/BIG HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON 
Du Pont's pouring himself a scotch and soda at the built-in wall bar. Mark's in the SITTING AREA of this large office, which gives the unmistakable impression of having been inspired by the Oval Office. (We should sense that this is not the first of these meetings.) 
DU PONT I can't get you anything at all? 
MARK No, thank you. I'm good. 
DU PONT In training. Excellent. 
DU PONT I think you're up. 
Silence. Du Pont goes over to him, unsure what to do. Uncomfortable, he puts his hand on Mark's shoulder. 
DU PONT (CONT'D) Mark. Dave just won. It's your turn. 
Mark's body starts to shake. Then, very quietly: 
MARK I don't want to let you down. 
This is the first time anyone has said anything like this to du Pont. He has no idea how to respond. He woodenly pats Mark's shoulder, then takes his hand back. 
DU PONT I can't.... I've watched you these past months... (long beat, then quietly) I can't imagine being let down by you. 
Mark stops shaking. Du Pont stands patiently beside him. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ARENA/CLERMONT-FERRAND - MOMENTS LATER 
CAMERA'S TIGHT ON Mark as he enters the arena. Mark walks directly onto the mat, straight to the center, faces off with the Bulgarian, NANEV. CAMERA stays tight on Mark looking directly at Nanev, as the ref checks each of them. 
WHISTLE. The match begins. Intense and rough. Neither able to gain an edge. Dave coaches from Mark's corner. 
CUT TO: 
In between periods. Mark sits as Dave FANS him with a towel, shouting instruction. Mark glances behind him: du Pont watches from the stands. 
CUT TO: 
Mark and Nanev wrestle the final seconds - Mark ahead by a point. Nanev tries desperately to turn Mark, to gain any advantage. The whistle blows. 
The ref takes each of their hands. He RAISES Mark's. He turns them around, raises Mark's hand again. 
Mark does a BACK FLIP. He trots over to the opposing coach, shakes his hand. He trots to his corner where Dave - beaming, his arms open wide - embraces him. Mark hugs his brother quickly, then turns to LOOK OUT into the stands. 
He SPOTS du Pont, who's coming down the steps toward the platform. Mark walks toward him. The enormity of what he's just accomplished STARTS TO HIT Mark. His face is red. He reaches du Pont, and from a step below him, THROWS HIS ARMS around him, clings to him. Mark starts to SOB. 
Du Pont holds him as he looks out toward the wrestling mat, where Dave watches. 
PRELAP SOUND: The beginning "AAAAAH's" of David Bowie's "LET'S DANCE". 
CUT TO: 
INT. TROPHY ROOM/BIG HOUSE - NIGHT 
"LET'S DANCE" blasts from the stereo. Team Foxcatcher wrestlers are huddled in a circle in the Trophy Room - shouting the "AAAAAAAH's" along with the thin white duke. Each holds a BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE, shaking it up as they sing. 
When the chords kick in, they POP THEIR CORKS - SPRAYING champagne on each other, shouting wildly. Then they all CHUG the rest of their bottles. Du Pont is dancing around outside the circle, doing his best Euro-electronica moves, and drinking from his bottle (and it's not his first). The wrestlers DANCE. When du Pont finishes his bottle - 
DU PONT Let's clear it out! 
He gestures toward the center section of the enormous TROPHY CASE - the entirety of which is filled with horse-jumping and fox-hunting medals, ribbons and plaques. 
Some of the wrestlers open the glass doors and start taking down what's in there. A few of the others open more liquor... 
DU PONT (CONT'D) Oh, yes! 
SPRINGER You sure about this? 
DU PONT Mother's idea of sport is riding a horse that's chasing a dog that's chasing a fox. I don't share her affection for horseflesh - 
The center case is cleared out. 
DU PONT (CONT'D) Put `em up, boys! 
They hang their wrestling medals, place in trophies and other awards - leaving the TOP FEW HOOKS EMPTY. 
WRESTLERS (CHANTING TOGETHER) Mark! Mark! Mark! Mark!... 
Mark hangs his OLYMPIC and WORLD CUP GOLDS on the top hooks. 
WRESTLERS (CONT'D) U.S.A! U.S.A! U.S.A!... 
Du Pont raises his bottle to Mark - 
DU PONT You've brought honor to Team Foxcatcher. 
He starts to walk toward him. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HILTON HOTEL, DC/BANQUET HALL - NIGHT 
Mark's on stage, at the podium, READING from his Brandon- prepared remarks with - shall we say - some vigor... 
MARK ... highly respected ornithologist, author, world explorer, phil... phila... 
Du Pont watches from the wings, whispers: 
DU PONT Philatelist. 
Mark looks over at him blankly - he has no idea what du Pont just said. 
DU PONT (CONT'D) Philatelist. (Mark just looks at him) PHILAT-- (GIVING UP) Stamp collector. 
MARK Stamp collector, and former pentathlete. 
Jean, in the audience, in her wheelchair, almost imperceptibly shakes her head. 
MARK (CONT'D) Mr. Du Pont will be making his return to competitive sports in the over-50 category at the Masters' League du Pont Wrestling Invitational in Phoenix, Arizona this March. 
Scattered applause, though no one has any idea what he's talking about. Du Pont watches from the wings. Mark reads. 
MARK (CONT'D) I'm so proud to introduce my mentor. He has the ability to look at me and see where I am in life. He knows how to motivate me. I feel his love for me as an athlete and as a human being. My mother and father were divorced when I was two years old. I spent a lifetime looking for a father... (MORE) 
MARK (CONT'D) and I found one in the Golden, uh... the Gold Eagle of America - John du Pont. 
Applause as du Pont strides onstage, hugs Mark. Du Pont turns, beaming (and a little hopped-up) to the audience - 
DU PONT Mark Schultz. Thank you, son. (waves to Jean in AUDIENCE) Hello, Mother. (to them all) The gold medal Mark won in 1984 was tarnished. Tarnished by Jimmy Carter. Tarnished by the unpatriotic acts of that democrat administration. He caused the entire Eastern bloc to boycott our Los Angeles Games. Mark will have an opportunity to shine up that medal at the World Championships in just a few short weeks. To prove his worth in front of the assembled nations of the globe... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. FOXCATCHER ESTATE - ESTABLISHING/LATE AFTERNOON 
Some time has passed. Lights are on in the windows of the Field House Gym. 
CUT TO: 
INT. FOXCATCHER GYM - LATE AFTERNOON 
Mark kneels on the mat with du Pont, holding him in the starting position. Mark is talking du Pont through the moves for an escape. 
We get the sense that this is not the first of these lessons. 
MARK Ready? Go. 
Du Pont clumsily attempts the escape. Mark is incredibly gentle with him, even tender, easing him through the moves. 
MARK (CONT'D) Okay. Let's try it again. 
CUT TO: 
INT. THE CHALET - NIGHT 
Mark's HAIR IS NOW CUT SHORT AND BLEACHED WHITE. He's in shorts - no shirt - on the phone. He's sipping a beer, walking around the living room - 
MARK (ON PHONE) Yeah. I'm good. Yeah.... All good. 
INTERCUT with Dave in the U of W gym office, looking out over a wrestling team night practice. 
DAVE (ON PHONE) You working hard? 
MARK (ON PHONE) Yeah. No, I'm kind of giving myself a bit of a break right now. I'll ramp it up again as the trials come closer. 
DAVE (ON PHONE) All right. How close? 
There a KNOCK on Mark's window. Mark looks over and sees du Pont standing outside, an eager look on his face. He beckons to Mark and moves TWO FINGERS as if cutting his own hair. 
MARK (to du Pont) Just a sec... 
DAVE (ON PHONE) What's that? 
MARK (ON PHONE) No, I wasn't - listen, I gotta run - 
DAVE (ON PHONE) What're you doing? 
MARK (ON PHONE) I just - I gotta run. 
Through large OPEN DOORS, in the adjoining gym, a larger crowd cheers on a number of NCAA wrestlers. FRED COLE and another USA WRESTLING OFFICIAL look in from the other gym. They SEE the posters of Mark on the walls, and they SEE: 
An exhausted du Pont, in his Foxcatcher singlet, is slumped in his chair, encouraging Mark to massage his shoulders. Mark OBLIGES. Mark glances at the OPEN DOORS, notices Fred Cole. Self-conscious, he ignores Cole and focuses on John. 
MARK When he gives you the slightest opening, you gotta shoot in on him. Be aggressive. Show him who's boss. 
Du Pont nods wearily. He can barely move. 
CUT TO: 
The final minute of the match. It's clearly RIGGED. The OTHER WRESTLER is trying to let the exhausted du Pont get the best of him. Mark watches. 
The REF blows the end of match whistle. The wrestlers stand, du Pont struggling to his feet. The ref takes each of their hands, and raises... du Pont's. He's "won". 
Du Pont limps off the mat. He approaches Mark, THROWS his arms around him the way Mark hugged du Pont at the Worlds. Mark glances toward the open doors to the other gym. 
CUT TO: 
INT. LOCKER ROOM/PHOENIX ARENA - MINUTES LATER 
Mark and an exhausted du Pont enter the locker room. Mark SEES, off in a corner, Brandon speaking quietly with the OTHER WRESTLER from du Pont's match. He watches Brandon HAND the other wrestler an ENVELOPE. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. FOXCATCHER LAWN - EVENING/ESTABLISHING 
The helicopter is on the lawn, blades slowing, shutting down. 
DU PONT (V.O.) I've rearranged some of the horse ribbons, Mother... 
CUT TO: 
INT. JEAN DU PONT'S ROOMS/FOXCATCHER - EVENING 
John is seated in front of his mother, next to a window in her third floor room. She's in her wheelchair, with the oxygen tubes in her nose, imperious as ever. 
DU PONT ... Some of the older prizes in the trophy case. (MORE) 
DU PONT (CONT'D) To make room for Team Foxcatcher medals.... For the wrestling awards. 
Silence. Jean just looks at her son, not reacting. 
DU PONT (CONT'D) Including this, Mother. Ha. Which I've actually just won. 
He takes his WINNER'S PLAQUE out of a duffel bag, trying to be casual, but seeming all the more like an eager 9 year-old. He holds it out for her. She doesn't take it, but leans forward slightly to read what's inscribed on it: "FIRST PLACE, OVER-50, DU PONT MASTER'S INVITATIONAL: JOHN `EAGLE' DU PONT." She sits back. 
JEAN Which ribbons? 
DU PONT I'm sorry? 
JEAN Which ribbons did you move? 
DU PONT Just some of the older ones. From the case. From the Rosemont case. 
Silence. 
JEAN I'll have a look later to see exactly what you've done.

INT. BEDROOM/THE CHALET - THAT NIGHT/LATE 
Mark awakens with a start to the sound of someone KNOCKING at the front door. He looks at the clock. It's 3 a.m. 
CUT TO: 
I/E. FRONT DOOR/THE CHALET - NIGHT 
Mark opens the door to find du Pont standing there, in his SWEATS. He clearly hasn't been to bed. And it's clearly an artificial stimulant that's been keeping him awake. 
DU PONT New moves. Wrestling moves. Need to try them out. 
MARK Oh, uh - 
DU PONT In the gym. 
Beat. Mark forces the cobwebs from his head. 
MARK Yeah, of course. Just... just give me a minute. 
CUT TO: 
INT. FOXCATCHER GYM - NIGHT 
Mark and du Pont are down on the wrestling mat. Du Pont on top. He's both weirdly aggressive with Mark - trying to get him in various holds - and also, in the bizarre way he's pressing against Mark, quasi-sexual. Mark is BLANK-FACED. Just waiting for it to end. 
FADE OUT. 
EXT. FOXCATCHER ESTATE - DAY 
WIDE SHOT of the Foxcatcher estate. In the distance, a HELICOPTER approaches, the rotors getting louder and louder. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. FOXCATCHER LAWN - DAY 
The helicopter has LANDED, the rotors still WHIRRING LOUDLY. (We won't hear dialogue in the following sequence.) 
DAVE and NANCY and the kids descend from the helicopter, GREETED warmly by the wrestling team. MARK IS ABSENT. 
Du Pont emerges from the Big House, trailed by Brandon. WE SEE du Pont notice what a warm reception Dave gets from the team. He comes down the steps, greets Dave and the family. 
CLOSE ON: Mark, who's at the very far end of the lawn, just inside the ring of trees, WATCHING. His HEAD is COMPLETELY SHAVED. 
MARK'S POV: Brandon and the team escort Nancy and the kids toward their new home. Du Pont and Dave ascend the Big House steps together. Du Pont puts his arm around Dave's shoulder. Far away, the Big House front door CLOSES. 
CUT TO: 
I/E. FRONT DOOR/THE CHALET - EARLY EVENING 
The door OPENS. Mark has opened it from the inside. He's looking out at: Dave, on his porch. Beat. 
DAVE Hey. 
MARK Hey, Dave. 
DAVE How you doing? 
MARK Good. I'm good. 
DAVE I hadn't seen you yet. I just want to make sure everything's okay. 
MARK Yeah. I'm just concentrating. Trials are in 50 days. 
Silence. 
DAVE You know, Nancy and the kids are here. 
MARK How they doing? 
DU PONT Keep it up, gentlemen. 
Largely ignored, he drifts off into the weight room. 
CUT TO: 
INT. WEIGHT ROOM/FOXCATCHER GYM - CONTINUOUS 
Mark sits on the LEG-PRESS, pressing an enormous amount of weight - repeatedly - straining, pushing himself. 
Du Pont enters. Mark tries to ignore him, continues to press the huge stack of weights. 
DU PONT Your brother's taking the reins. Leading. 
Mark finishes his set, stares straight ahead, catching his breath. 
DU PONT (CONT'D) You've got more in you than that. 
Mark turns his gaze to du Pont. SILENCE. Du Pont walks over behind him, starts massaging Mark's shoulders. 
DU PONT (CONT'D) You've got to dig deep. Find out what's inside. Discover what you're made of. 
MARK (QUIET) Please don't do that. 
Du Pont keeps massaging. Mark glances towards the wrestling room. 
DU PONT Conquer your demons, Mark. CONQUER - 
MARK (QUIET) - Please. I'm asking you to not... 
Dave is coming in the direction of the weight room. Mark STANDS and walks out of the gym. Du Pont turns and sees Dave come through the doorway. 
CUT TO: 
INT. THE CHALET - LATER 
CU on TV screen: Mark being taken down by a wrestler. The image pauses, plays again. And again. 
Mark sits in front of the screen, watching this sequence, over and over. Dave walks in through the open door. Mark doesn't acknowledge him. 
DAVE Why'd you take off so suddenly? 
MARK (STILL WATCHING) Need to study up. Fix some weakness. 
DAVE You been doing this since you left? 
MARK Pretty much. 
Beat. Dave stands there as Mark keeps watching. 
DAVE What's going on with you and John? 
MARK (STILL WATCHING) Nothing's going on. (BEAT) What does that mean? 
DAVE You seemed kind of upset in the gym. 
MARK (STILL WATCHING) The fuck you talking about? 
DU PONT He was talking to you about something and you seemed pretty upset. (THEN) What was he saying to you? 
MARK I don't know what you're talking about. 
Beat. 
DAVE Okay. You want me to leave you alone, I'll leave you alone. You decide you want to talk, you know where to find me. 
Dave walks out. Mark keeps watching his videotape. 
CUT TO: 
I/E. DU PONT'S CAR/FOXCATCHER - NEXT MORNING 
Du Pont drives his black Mercury. He's wearing what looks like an antique Revolutionary War General's battle COAT over a Foxcatcher t-shirt. There are a couple of MUSKETS in the back seat, another COAT. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. DAVE'S HOUSE/FOXCATCHER - SAME TIME 
Dave's got the hood of his car up. He's showing Alex how to change the oil filter. Danielle picks flowers in the yard and brings them to Nancy on the steps. 
DU PONT (CONT'D) Then... the whistle blows! 
Du Pont grabs onto Garcia. Tries to flip him. He can't move him at all. TOTAL SILENCE, except for Du Pont grunting. 
Mrs. Du Pont, stoic - watches her son. Then she signals to her attendant to take her away. She's wheeled out. 
Du Pont sees her go. 
FADE OUT. 
INT. WRESTLING ARENA/PENSACOLA - DAY 
Dave wrestles. He's having trouble with a younger wrestler. 
Mark stretches by the wall, alone, trying to concentrate on his upcoming match. He keeps glancing over at his struggling brother, and at du Pont in Dave's corner. 
CUT TO: 
Du Pont FANS Dave with a towel in between periods, "coaching him", giving "advice". He's BEING FILMED BY A CAMERA CREW. 
CUT TO: 
End of Dave's match. Mark watches the ref raise the other wrestler's hand. Mark's stunned. 
ANNOUNCER (OVER P.A.) That's the second - and final - loss for David Schultz. 
Dave graciously HUGS the other wrestler. ON MARK, watching, devastated, 
CUT TO: 
INT. WRESTLING ARENA/PENSACOLA - LATER/DAY 
Mark's on the mat, battling a college wrestler, Rico Chipparelli. Mark's struggling. We see a vulnerability we haven't seen before - something lost or disoriented. Dave shouts from the corner. 
DAVE Get after him, Mark! Shoot low!... 
Du Pont, BEING FILMED, claps, calls out instruction - 
DU PONT Need to get after him, there. Low low low. 
CUT TO: 
In between periods, Mark sits in the chair in his corner while Dave gets in his face, coaching. But all Mark can pay attention to is du Pont clumsily FANNING him with a towel. 
DAVE He's open to the left. He leaves his entire left side open. You gotta get after that fucker! Make him pay. Now or never... 
CUT TO: 
Mark's back out on the mat. It's not working. Mark gets PINNED. The wrestlers stand. The ref holds both of their hands, RAISES Chipparelli's arm. He turns them around, raises Chipparelli's arm again. 
Mark walks off the mat. Dave tries to console him. 
DAVE (CONT'D) Double elimination, buddy. You'll get it back. 
DU PONT Next time, Mark. A good effort. 
Mark walks right past them, off the mats. We TRAIL him, staying with him as he walks straight out the arena door. 
EXT. PARKING LOT/WRESTLING ARENA - CONTINUOUS 
Mark walks out the door and along the side of the building. He turns down a side entrance ramp for delivery trucks leading down to an underground garage. 
I/E. DELIVERY TUNNEL/WRESTLING ARENA - CONTINUOUS 
Mark's alone here. He BANGS his head against the cement wall, smashing it repeatedly. He screams at himself. He punches himself. Punishment for losing. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MARK'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY 
Mark, still in his wrestling clothes, sits on the edge of his bed in front of a ROOM SERVICE CART loaded with food. His face is bloody. He gorges himself on fried chicken, sandwiches, french fries. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MARK'S HOTEL ROOM - LATER 
Mark's on his knees at the room MINI-BAR, having discovered the Kit-Kat's, M&Ms. TV's on, place is a wreck. A KNOCK at the door. LOUDER. Mark looks through the peephole. His POV: 
DAVE Open up - I know you're in there. 
DAVE Wait! Wait! We're here... (TO MARK) Get 'em off. 
The official looks at them, OPENS his log book. Dave helps Mark peel off his sweats. Soaked, they hit the floor with a smack. Mark, in his singlet, gets on the scale. 
He's 30 GRAMS OVERWEIGHT (5 ounces). He steps off, and Dave helps PEEL his singlet off. He gets back on the scale naked. The official slides the weight bar... 
3 GRAMS OVER. Dave grabs Mark. 
DAVE (CONT'D) Come here. 
He grabs his wallet from his sweats pocket and pulls out a CREDIT CARD, dropping the wallet on the floor. Dave SQUEEGEES sweat off Mark's naked body with the card. Scraping him down. 
He helps Mark back on the scale. The pointer bobs, finally reaches equilibrium. 
OFFICIAL 82 kilos. 
Mark practically COLLAPSES. Dave helps him off the scale, walks him over to a bench, sits him down. He grabs a GATORADE from nearby table and hold it out to Mark, who looks like he might pass out. 
DAVE Mark. Drink. 
Mark just sits there. Not taking the drink. 
DAVE (CONT'D) Mark... 
SMASH CUT TO: 
INT. WRESTLING ARENA/PENSACOLA - DAY 
Mark SLAMS his opponent, Mike Sheets, to the mat. He's like an animal, dominating, aggressive. 
Dave coaches from Mark's corner. 
INT. WRESTLING ARENA/PENSACOLA - DAY 
A SERIES OF QUICK CUTS OF MARK'S MATCHES: Mark dominating, turning his opponents, taking them down... 
THEN: The END WHISTLE of Mark's final match. The wrestlers stand and the referee RAISES MARK'S ARM... 
DAVE YAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH! 
Dave's EXULTANT - leaping and screaming onto the mat - he grabs his brother in a BEAR HUG and LIFTS him off the mat. 
As Dave joyfully carries his exhausted, victorious brother around the mat, he glances over at where du Pont would be sitting. Empty seat. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Dave walks down the long hall checking door numbers. He stops to KNOCK on one. After a moment, Stan Beck opens the door. 
DAVE Hey, Stan. 
STAN BECK Dave. What can I do for you? 
DAVE I'm having some trouble finding John. He's not in his room - 
STAN BECK - Right. 
DAVE - I wanted to check in with him. I had a kind of uncomfortable thing with John before the match this afternoon - Mark was in a really delicate place, and I had to ask John to not be in his corner. I just wanted to make sure he's okay with everything. And that he's happy with the result. With how things turned out. 
STAN BECK Dave. Mr. du Pont's mother died this morning. He flew home to Philadelphia earlier today. 
On Dave, stunned. 
Dylan's "All the Tired Horses" STARTS TO PLAY. 
CUT TO: 
INT. FOXCATCHER ESTATE/TROPHY ROOM - DAY 
"All the Tired Horses" PLAYS. 
C/U on Jean du Pont's face in an OIL PAINTING. 
SHOTS of her horse-jumping ribbons; PHOTOS of Jean riding; the space John cleared for his wrestlers' MEDALS; John's Masters' Tournament winner's PLAQUE. 
A SHOT of the POSTER of Mark oiled-up, hanging on the wall. 
CUT TO: 
Dave has to laugh. 
DAVE Congrats, my brother. 
As Mark walks into the Chalet, he looks over toward the Big House, where he can see a SECURITY DETAIL fanned out on the lawn, sweeping the ground with metal detectors. 
IN THE CAR: Dave looks down at envelope in his hand. 
NANCY What you got, baby? 
Opens it. Beat. 
DAVE John wrote me a check for ten thousand dollars. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. FOXCATCHER - MORNING 
WIDE SHOT as du Pont trudges across the lawn toward the Field House in Foxcatcher sweats. After a few moments, he's followed by a LARGE PLAINCLOTHES SECURITY GUARD in a dark suit... and by Stan Beck. 
CUT TO: 
INT. FOXCATCHER GYM - MORNING 
Wrestlers warm up, work out, lift weights. Dave and Mark train intensively together, doing TAKE-DOWN DRILLS. Mark executes, Dave murmurs instruction to Mark, they do the drill again. 
Du Pont WALKS IN THE GYM, trailed by the his Plainclothes Security Guard and Stan. Du Pont looks like he hasn't showered in a few days. 
Dave moves toward John, offering greetings and condolences -- "How you doing there, Coach," "Sorry to hear about your mother, sir," etc. 
Du Pont brushes off the offers of sympathy - 
DU PONT No no. All's fine. There's work to be done. (CLAPS) Back to work, gentlemen. 
As they go back to their drills, John stays on the perimeter, watching Mark, STARING at them. It's disconcerting. 
Dave moves back to work with Mark. 
DAVE Mark. Focus. Look at me. (Mark looks at him) Focus on me. (MARK NODS) You here? (MARK NODS) Let's run it again. 
Mark tries to run the takedown, Dave escapes, he spins on Mark and takes him down hard. As they stand up, Dave smacks MARK - 
DAVE (CONT'D) Get your head on straight and do this. 
Du Pont walks over. Mark can barely look at him. Du Pont stops close to Mark. 
Mark looks to Dave to save him from this. Dave's clearly caught in the middle. 
Mark looks down, closes his eyes as if in pain. Du Pont moves close to Dave, speaking to him so Mark can hear - 
DU PONT If you and I can't get him there, no one can. We're in this together. 
After a long moment, du Pont moves off the mat. He starts to stretch nearby. As Dave tries to get Mark back to work, du Pont starts to JOG around the perimeter of the gym. Mark's trying to keep it together, but it's clearly driving him insane. As du Pont jogs and jogs - 
PRELAP: 
DU PONT (V.O.) Our challenge... as coaches... as leaders. I have coached... and psychologically prepare... Our Mark Schultz. To capture Olympic Gold... 
CUT TO: 
INT. DU PONT'S OFFICE/BIG HOUSE - DAY 
C/U of du Pont. HE'S SPEAKING DIRECTLY TO CAMERA. We're not sure where we are yet. He speaks haltingly, with effort, trying to be authoritative. 
DU PONT ...I wear many hats. I am leader. Mentor. Father figure. Brother. Older brother. At times the younger... 
INT. DU PONT'S OFFICE/BIG HOUSE - DAY 
From a WIDER ANGLE, we see that he's being FILMED for the documentary. He wears his Foxcatcher sweat jacket with HEAD COACH and JOHN `Eagle' du PONT" stitched onto it. 
DU PONT It will not be easy. We have built... our family. Our obligation... is to build... winners... In life. To teach the secret... To build men who will... think of... Who will understand... the character traits... We must teach them... whether they will listen or no. 
He's finished. Silence. He stares steadily into the camera. Then he twitches. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. FOXCATCHER ESTATE/VARIOUS - NIGHT 
A SECURITY TEAM taps on the outside of the main house, listen to the walls with what look like giant STETHOSCOPES. 
MARK Were you in the Big House yesterday? 
DAVE For a little while. 
MARK In the afternoon? Because I got turned away when I came within fifty yards of the house. (THEN) What were you doing there? 
DAVE I'm a coach here. I get paid by John. I was meeting with John. 
MARK About what? 
DAVE Mark. Get dressed. 
MARK He's weakening me. 
DAVE What are you talking about? 
MARK I talked to Bachman at SMU last night. He says they're expanding the program. There'll be room for both of us in the fall - 
DAVE - Mark - 
MARK - I told him we could all get on the phone next weekend - 
DAVE - You need to focus on what's happening a month from now. Not - 
MARK - SMU's gonna make a move, they're gonna take a run at it - we can be there at the beginning - 
DAVE - Don't do this. Don't do it. Stay clear about what we're working for. 
MARK - I can't do this anymore. I can't do it - 
DAVE - It's not the time, Mark - 
MARK - John's killing me here - 
DAVE - He's not killing you - 
MARK - If we at least let Bachman know by the end of the week we'll have a place to go to after - 
DAVE - Stop. Stop it! 
Long beat as Dave looks at Mark. As gently as he can: 
DAVE (CONT'D) I will make sure you're taken care of after Seoul. I'll talk to John - whatever you decide: you want to stay, you want to go - I'll make sure you're taken care of. 
Mark's looking at his brother, something dawning on him for the first time. 
MARK You're not thinking of staying here...? 
DAVE I don't know, Mark. The schools are great, the kids are happy. They have eight hundred acres to run around in... 
Mark's at a complete loss. Just when he'd reconnected with his brother, it seems they'll be separated again. 
DAVE (CONT'D) If you win next month you're in a class by yourself, you write your own ticket. You live your own life however you want. Focus on that. 
MARK (QUIETLY) My own life. 
DAVE That's right. 
MARK And you'll be here. 
DAVE I'll be here. Whenever you need me. 
Mark seems lost. Dave pats him on the shoulder and turns to walk toward his office. Mark watches him walk away, then - 
MARK What's on your forehead? 
DAVE What? 
MARK It says kids. 
DAVE To remind me to pick up the kids from school. 
MARK What does that mean? When are you gonna you see your own forehead? 
DAVE I don't have to. You just told me. 
On Mark, PRELAP: 
CORPORAL Here we go, sir. Five tons of fun. 
Du Pont BREAKS the surface. He looks around, then swims slowly to shore. The tank remains on the bottom of the pond. 
CUT TO: 
INT. DU PONT'S OFFICE - DAY 
Dave and Mark sit on the couch across from Stan Beck and du Pont. Dave is firm and clear, but entirely diplomatic. Du Pont looks dishevelled, he won't meet anyone's gaze. We can see the POSTER of Mark hanging on the wall. 
DAVE I'll commit to remaining at Foxcatcher so long as John wants me here, but only if my brother is taken care of. 
STAN BECK Taken care of how? 
DAVE So long as I'm here, Mark will continue to be paid. 
STAN BECK Paid what? 
DAVE His full salary. 
STAN BECK You want him paid even if he leaves? What if he quits? 
DAVE Whether or not he chooses to stay. That's right. 
Stan's incredulous. He glances over at du Pont, but his boss doesn't make eye contact. Stan turns back to Dave. 
STAN BECK You're making quite an assumption about the value of your presence here. 
DAVE You're welcome to test the theory. 
STAN BECK What does that mean? 
DAVE We can see how many wrestlers stay if I decide to go. (BEAT) I hope it doesn't come to that. (BEAT) I'd also ask John to understand the delicate nature of the lead-up to Seoul, and please allow Mark some space. Let him train just with me. 
Du Pont winces at this, but keeps quiet. 
STAN BECK (TO MARK) You're that determined to leave? 
Mark doesn't respond. 
DAVE He'd like the option. 
Stan leans over to du Pont and WHISPERS in his ear. It goes on for several seconds. Finally, du Pont NODS very slightly. 
STAN BECK First of all, Mark has always been free to train in whatever - 
DAVE - That's not exactly how it's - 
STAN BECK - Just a minute - you've had your say. 
DAVE Sorry. 
STAN BECK - To train in whatever way is most effective for him. Eagle offers his advice and counsel. If Mark chooses to ignore it, that's his loss. (THEN) Mr. du Pont would be prepared to accept your financial terms, but only if we get an answer to what we proposed weeks ago. 
DAVE What's that? 
STAN BECK That John du Pont, Head Coach of Team Foxcatcher, be seated in Mark's corner throughout the Olympic Games. 
Mark looks at Dave. Quiet, betrayed -- 
MARK You've talked about this? 
DAVE I was waiting for the right moment to bring it up with you. You haven't exactly been in a receptive frame of mind. 
A long beat. Then Mark shrugs, and looks away from his brother. He's given up fighting this fight. 
STAN BECK All right, then. I guess we're done. 
Silence as they all just sit there. 
SMASH CUT TO: 
INT. OLYMPIC STADIUM/HALLWAY/SEOUL - DAY 
C/U on Mark, in his wrestling gear, looking disoriented, unfocused. He's in the hall right outside the locker room, just steps away from the WRESTLING ARENA. Dave's in his face - talking to him INTENSELY over the sounds of the crowd inside - 
DAVE This is your moment to prove yourself - your moment to step out alone, away from everyone, into the spotlight. This has nothing to do with me, nothing to do with John - 
Du Pont hovers a few feet behind Dave, being filmed by his CAMERA CREW. Mark's eyes keep glancing over at him. 
DAVE (CONT'D) - nothing to do with anyone but you. This is you, Mark. This is you. Focus and take what's yours! 
OVER the last of these shots, WE HEAR a DEEP, OVERLY DRAMATIC VOICE coming from a TV: 
VIDEO ANNOUNCER (V.O.) ... He's coached national and world champions with his unique blend of passion and inspiration... 
C/U of a TV SCREEN: a SERIES OF IMAGES: Mark Schultz winning matches (one of the images is the one that became the Foxcatcher poster); Dave winning; Dan Bane winning..... 
THEN, on screen, is the scene of du Pont "teaching" Mark a WRESTLING MOVE: 
DU PONT From the under hook, pivot sideways while pulling down on his arm. Kneel between his legs and take him to the mat. 
Mark lets du Pont take him down, though it's abundantly apparent how much Mark is gritting his teeth through this. 
INT. LARGE EMPTY ROOM/BIG HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
WE SEE where we are: a huge empty room - once used for grand dances. 
In a corner: du Pont and the Documentary Director sit on two chairs in front of a TV hooked up to a VCR. The Director is screening "The John du Pont Story" for his boss. 
Du Pont has a PISTOL tucked in his waistband. 
ON THE VIDEO: A SHOT OF: Mark finding du Pont in the stands at the Worlds and hugging him tightly. 
A SHOT OF: Mark winning the Olympic Trials and Dave HUGGING and LIFTING his brother into the air. 
A SHOT OF: du Pont watching this from the stands and raising his fist in the air. 
A SHOT OF: Dave talking to the camera in the Foxcatcher gym: 
DAVE He's made himself an - an expert in the art and sport of wrestling... 
Dave stumbles on the words - 
DAVE (CONT'D) Eagle is indispensable to - uh - what it... what we're trying to accomplish here. 
Dave looks down, obviously uncomfortable - 
DAVE (CONT'D) We... consider John... one of us. (QUIETLY) One of us. 
A SHOT OF: du Pont talking to the camera, haltingly - trying so hard to be authoritative, inspirational: 
DU PONT Our challenge... as coaches... as leaders. I have coached... and psychologically prepare... our Mark Schultz... to capture Olympic Gold. I wear many hats. I am leader. Mentor. Father figure. Brother. 
A SHOT of a GOLDEN EAGLE sitting on a tree branch, then flying away. 
VIDEO ANNOUNCER (V.O.) The symbol of America is the Golden Eagle... 
A SHOT of du Pont climbing into the pilot seat of his helicopter. He puts on his headset. 
VIDEO ANNOUNCER (V.O.) John du Pont is that Golden Eagle. 
Du Pont takes off in the helicopter and flies away. Over this shot, the end title comes up: "THE GOLDEN EAGLE OF AMERICA - THE JOHN DU PONT STORY." 
THE TAPE ENDS. The TV screen goes to static snow. 
SILENCE. Du Pont sits there, Director next to him. Finally, du Pont stands and starts for the door. Director follows. 
DOCUMENTARY DIRECTOR We've bought several time slots next week on local station WPHI - 
DU PONT (STILL MOVING) Good. 
DOCUMENTARY DIRECTOR - Several late night slots, of course, but there was also an open afternoon half-hour, directly after "The Edge of Night." That should be a good one - 
Du Pont continues right out the door, down the hallway, not even turning to face him. 
DU PONT Excellent. 
The Director stops at the door. He calls out to du Pont -- 
DOCUMENTARY DIRECTOR - I'll let you know what the viewership numbers are as soon as I have them. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. BIG HOUSE - DAY 
Du Pont walks out a SIDE DOOR of the Big House, followed by the LARGE PLAINCLOTHES SECURITY GUARD. 
He continues toward his car - the BLACK MERCURY - goes to the driver's side. Then, something catches his eye in a nearby tree - he points it out the Security Guard: 
DU PONT Northern Cardinal. Look at that.

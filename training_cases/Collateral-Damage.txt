Anne opens the door to find an exhausted Gordy sitting on the floor with their four-year-old son, MATT. They're building a K'nex spaceship. 
MATT Look what we made! 
ANNE Nice rocket... That took a while. 
GORDY He was awake when I got home.   His throat still hurts. 
ANNE Shit. 
MATT That's a bad word. 
GORDY You're right. (CONTINUED) 
18   CONTINUED:                                                        18 
ANNE Sorry. 
She feels Matt's forehead.    Gordy's done it already. 
GORDY No fever. 
ANNE (to Matt) You better see Dr. Bob. (to Gordy) And this time, no opening fire hydrants to play in till he's completely well. 
GORDY Yes, ma'am. 
She leans down and kisses him.      There's passion in it. 
ANNE How was your shift? 
GORDY (shrugs) The usual. 
She yawns.    Starts heading out. 
ANNE Dreamed I did a triple axel in an ice skating championship. 
GORDY (beat; calls after her) Come back and let me see those legs again. 
19   INT. BATHROOM - DAY                                               19 
Gordy holds Matt in his arms as water pours over them. It's the second child he's held in the last few hours. This one is his, this one is safe at home and unafraid: what a father wants for his child. We see the deep affection Gordy has for his son. He holds Matt tightly, skin to skin, and kisses the boy's wet head... 
Anne opens the shower door.       She's on the phone. 
(CONTINUED) 
19   CONTINUED:                                                      19 
ANNE Dr. Bob can squeeze him in at twelve. I have a patient relations meeting at twelve- fifteen. Can you take him? 
GORDY I have a game. But yeah, if we do the handoff at the doctor's. 
ANNE (into phone) Yes, he'll be there... Thanks. (hangs up; to Gordy) Five-of in front of Dr. Bob's. Don't be late. (to Matt) Let's get you out, sweetie. Your father just can't keep you dry. 
She leads Matt out. Closes the shower door. Gordy sticks his face into the water. Looks back, finds... 
Two bare butts, Anne's and Matt's, are pressed against the shower door's foggy glass. OFF Gordy, laughing -- 
20   EXT. SPANISH HARLEM - BASKETBALL COURT - DAY                    20 
It appears the entire neighborhood's crammed against the chain-link fence around the court, yelling and cheering as a team of local kids from the NYFD Athletic League plays a team of local kids from the NYPD Athletic League. 
Gordy's an NYFD coach, exhorts his team at the top of his lungs. 
The rivalry's intense. The game close.       The noise deafening. Bets are going down. 
NYFD goes up by one in the final minute. 
Gordy disses a cop coaching the opposing team. 
LUIS is one of Gordy's kids. A small but talented fifteen-year-old. Luis steals the ball. Drives for an unguarded lay-up to put the team up by three... And misses. An opponent recovers the ball. The flow shifts toward the other end, but Luis is slow adjusting, devastated at missing the easy "two." Gordy yells at him to defend. 
GORDY Luis, get back! Pick up your man! 
(CONTINUED) 
20   CONTINUED:                                                  20 
Luis shakes it off. Hustles back on "D" as his man gets the ball. The opponent's a step ahead. Goes up... And Luis gets there to reject him. The crowd loves it. The BUZZER SOUNDS. NYFD wins. 
21   SAME SCENE - GORDY AND LUIS - MOMENTS LATER                 21 
In the game's immediate aftermath. NYFD celebrating around them. Gordy's proud of Luis. 
GORDY We lose, win, whatever. But one thing we never do. We never, ever give up. Right? 
OFF Gordy, smiling at Luis... 
22   SAME SCENE - LATER                                          22 
The crowds are gone. Gordy checks his watch and starts off, when a SOUND draws his attention. 
23   GORDY'S POV                                                 23 
Luis walks along the inside of the chain-link fence around the court. A neighborhood gangbanger and his crew match Luis step for step outside the fence, rattling the fence, clearly trying to intimidate him. 
24   BACK TO SCENE                                               24 
Gordy stalks walking toward them.    Calls -- 
GORDY Luis... 
Seeing Gordy approach, the gangbanger and crew drift off. Reaching Luis -- 
GORDY What was that about? 
LUIS Told 'em I wouldn't play with 'em anymore. 
But Gordy sees Luis is scared. And he sees the gangbanger and crew hovering nearby waiting for Gordy to go. 
There's a horrible SCREECH. A TAXI SKIDS sideways to avoid the FedEx truck and hits Gordy. He's in the air, tumbling, then smacks to the ground. 
Gordy looks up, through the smoke and falling debris. Then struggles to his hands and knees. 
GORDY Anne! 
He tries to stand, then falls down, screaming in pain, a large shard of glass embedded in his leg. 
People come to help him, but Gordy only cares about finding Anne and Matt. He looks around desperately but can't see them, when... 
His eyes go to the spaceship, in pieces on the pavement. 
(CONTINUED) 
44   CONTINUED:                                                     44 
Gordy screams out his agony -- 
GORDY Noooooo!!! 
45   EXT. COLOMBIAN CONSULATE                                       45 
The blast detonated here. Some men from the Navigators are dead. MIKE BRANDT is not. Rises from the devastation, gun in hand, as SIRENS wail in the distance. 
46   EXT. 68TH AND MADISON - LATER                                  46 
Emergency personnel - EMS, NYPD, NYFD -- swarm the area. 
Two white plastic sheets cover two bodies. 
Across the street, PARAMEDICS work on Gordy's leg. 
PARAMEDIC #1 We're gonna give you a shot. 
Gordy's oblivious to the pain.     Shoves him away. 
GORDY I need to see them! 
PARAMEDIC #1 We gotta help you right now. 
PARAMEDIC #2 We've done all we can for 'em, Gordy. 
47   ANOTHER ANGLE                                                  47 
FBI agent JOE PHIPPS ducks under the police tape.     REGGIE DRAY, a young agent, meets him. As they walk -- 
DRAY Device functioned in front of the Colombian Consulate just as a motorcade full of brass arrived. 
PHIPPS Who were the brass, and why were they here? 
(CONTINUED) 
47   CONTINUED:                                                     47 
DRAY No one's talking yet, but it smells high-level. There were Colombians and Americans in the cars. Three of 'em ate it. Guy on the phone -- 
He indicates Brandt, talking on a cell phone. 
DRAY -- is one of the survivors. Name's Brandt. C.I.A. 
That gets Phipps' interest momentarily. Then, as they continue toward the consulate, he notices security cameras on the building. 
PHIPPS Check the surveillance cameras? 
DRAY We're pulling up the video now. 
PHIPPS (stops; looks around) Where's N.Y.P.D. on this? 
DRAY They know it's ours. They're helping with shoe-leather. 
Phipps' eyes go to the white sheets up the street. 
DRAY We got two dead bystanders, a mother and four-year-old son. The father's over there with a leg wound. (indicates Gordy) Guy's a lieutenant with the New York F.D. 
PHIPPS Anybody talk to him yet? 
DRAY We've been giving him room. 
48   BACK TO GORDY                                                  48 
In b.g., Mike, the veteran firefighter in Gordy's engine company, looks under the sheets with a cop. 
(CONTINUED) 
48   CONTINUED:                                                     48 
Junior puts a gentle hand on Gordy's shoulder. 
JUNIOR Gordy. 
Gordy looks up him, meets his eyes. 
JUNIOR Me and Mike are here. 
GORDY ... I was late... They shouldn't have been there... 
JUNIOR It's not your fault. 
GORDY I need to see them. 
Mike has walked up, lays a comforting hand on Gordy. 
MIKE No. You don't need to see 'em that way, Gordo. 
Junior spots a news camera crew focusing on Gordy's grief, calls at a cop. 
JUNIOR Get those goddamn people outta here! 
Phipps, approaching with Dray, addresses the same cop. 
50   CONTINUED:    (2)                                               50 
SAL Christ.    Gordy... 
But Gordy's already on his feet, already moving. 
GORDY I gotta help 'em get the bastard. 
51   INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE - FBI INCIDENT CENTER - NIGHT           51 
A well-lit, sectioned-off area of the garage secured by a chain-link fence. 
Phipps enters.      As he passes Dray, already there -- 
PHIPPS How long before we have a secure computer network? 
DRAY An hour.   They're building it now. 
Phipps moves to a FORENSIC EXPERT hovering over a table of small fragments. 
PHIPPS What do you got? 
FORENSIC EXPERT #1 Pieces of a pager oxidized with trace elements of Semtex. Probably the triggering device. They dial it up, probably from a cell phone, and boom... 
He picks up a microchip. 
FORENSIC EXPERT #1 ... This is the memory chip. I can build it into a working pager and maybe get a number readout. 
PHIPPS Do it. 
Phipps moves to the next work area, where another FORENSIC EXPERT studies video from a consulate surveillance camera. 
52   ON SCREEN                                                     52 
in super slow-mo, we see a cop -- the one who later bumped into Gordy -- in front of the consulate. His hat is pulled down over his eyes, almost concealing his tinted glasses. As the cop faces more toward the camera, the expert freeze-frames. To Phipps -- 
53   FORENSIC EXPERT #2                                            53 
FORENSIC EXPERT #2 That's as much face as we get. He was careful to duck the camera. 
PHIPPS Run a total analysis. I want to know if this asshole's right or left-handed. I want everything you can get outta this film. 
Phipps keeps moving, enters an eerie recreation of the blast site. Streets, buildings, etc. are marked out on the garage floor. Pieces of the Navigators rest in front of the area marked "consulate;" parts of an NYPD traffic scooter rest in front of the Navigators; "X's" mark where Anne and Matt were standing. 
Phipps crosses to another AGENT. 
PHIPPS Any helpful information coming outta Colombia? 
AGENT Not yet. Sat-Intel hasn't picked up any related data-traffic, either. 
Dray walks up. 
DRAY Gordon Pitt's here. He says he saw a cop at the scene. 
54   SAME SCENE - LATER                                            54 
Gordy, accompanied by Mike and Ronnie, sits in front of a video monitor. Phipps and Dray look on. 
55   ON SCREEN                                                     55 
a police cart pulls up outside the consulate.

PHIPPS The cart was stolen from the Central Park Precinct yesterday. 
The cop gets out of the scooter. 
GORDY That's him. That's the son of a bitch I bumped into. 
The cop tickets a vehicle, then walks west out of frame. 
PHIPPS The bomb's in the cart. 
56   PHIPPS                                                          56 
reverses the video, freeze-frames on the cop. 
PHIPPS We think the bomb was triggered by a cell phone. The guy doesn't have one in his hands here. Did you see a cell phone when you ran into him? 
GORDY ... No. 
PHIPPS How much time passed between then and the explosion? 
GORDY ... Seconds... Five, ten... 
PHIPPS We think maybe he got into the brown Ford. You see him then? 
GORDY All I cared about was getting to my wife and boy. 
DRAY (to Phipps) Guy still had enough time to get out a phone and dial it in. 
(CONTINUED) 
56   CONTINUED:                                                      56 
PHIPPS (beat, then, by way of ending it) We might need to call you in again to look at some photos. 
Beat.   Gordy looks back at the grainy image of the cop. 
GORDY ... I touched him... 
57   EXT. CEMETERY - DAY                                             57 
A bagpiper plays "Amazing Grace." 
REVEAL Gordy holding Matt's small coffin as Anne's is lowered into the ground. Gordy's men are around him, along with many other NYFD personnel, family and friends. 
PHIPPS ... Mike was in the motorcade that day... He's the chief U.S. intelligence officer overseeing Colombia. 
BRANDT Don't worry, Mr. Pitt, we're gonna get the son-of-a-bitch. 
GORDY You know where he is? 
BRANDT We believe The Wolf's in hiding in an area of Colombia controlled by the E.L.C., extreme Marxist guerrillas... He thinks he's in a safe haven. 
Brandt lets "thinks" sink in. 
PHIPPS I know it's hard for you right now, Mr. Pitt. We're all sorry. But why don't you go home. We're taking care of things. 
Beat.   Brandt proffers a business card. 
BRANDT Here's my card. Call me any time. 
Gordy takes it.    Just sits there a long moment, then -- 
GORDY What kind of twisted people do things like this? 
Beat.   Brandt and Phipps don't have an answer. 
69   INT. NEW YORK TIMES - BULLPEN - DAY                        69 
Gordy talks to a Latin reporter, ERNIE OROSCO. 
OROSCO You interested in the big picture or all the unpleasant details? 
GORDY My family died because of what's going on down there. I want to know all I can. 
Orosco searches for a starting point.   Then -- 
OROSCO Well, basically, the situation in Colombia sucks... 
As Orosco continues... 
70   MONTAGE - DAY/NIGHT                                        70 
Over the course of a week: 
1. Gordy takes pictures, etc., off a wall in his home. He pins up photos of Anne and Matt at the top of the wall. Beneath them he pins up a large map of Colombia. 
OROSCO (V.O.) ... The government's been fighting different Marxists factions for over thirty-five years. For most of that time, it was winning... 
71   NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY                                    71 
2. At the New York Public Library, Gordy uses microfilm files and computer access to the web to search out information on Colombia and The Wolf. 
OROSCO (V.O.) ... Suddenly the guerrillas began chopping 'em up. High-tech weapons and equipment, well- trained troops, aggressive hit- and-run tactics, all financed by extortion, kidnapping and collecting taxes from dope growers. It's big money, and they put it to use... 
72   GORDY                                                          72 
3. Gordy pins up various Colombia-related articles and pictures on the wall, including the surveillance camera still of The Wolf from the front page of The New York Post. 
OROSCO (V.O.) ... The government got scared. In 1998, to jump start peace talks, it gave a coalition of guerrilla groups temporary control over much of southern Colombia... The first communist stronghold on an American continent... 
73   GORDY                                                          73 
4.   Gordy draws a line around the guerrilla zone. 
OROSCO (V.O.) ... But there've been few talks and no peace. And the Colombian military can't get near the guerrilla zone, especially around the town of Caguan, where the E.L.C. kicks ass and takes no prisoners... 
74   GORDY                                                          74 
5.   Gordy circles and labels the ELC-controlled area. 
OROSCO (V.O.) ... And that's where we come in. Supposedly, to help eliminate narcos operating in the guerrilla zone. But some well-informed people think that's just an excuse to hit the guerrillas themselves, since they're wrapped around the drug trade... We're there, we're involved... If we stay, the only real question is which Vietnam War we're gonna have. The one some feel we could've won or the one we lost... 
75   GORDY                                                          75 
6. Gordy watches a documentary about Colombia which shows rebels, army troops, death squads, firefights, and with atrocities and bodies on both sides. 
(CONTINUED) 
75   CONTINUED:                                                         75 
OROSCO (V.O.) ... Bottom line? The place is as dangerous as a snakepit. You've got the different guerrilla groups, C.I.A., F.B.I., D.E.A., Colombian military, U.S. military, right- wing death squads -- and the only thing they've all managed to do is destroy a beautiful country and inflict suffering on the real people... Hey, I'm Colombian, and I'll never go back... 
OFF Gordy's packed wall... 
76   SAME SCENE - ANOTHER DAY                                           76 
As Gordy closes the front door, REVEAL Mike, the firefighter, who's just come in and now stands staring at the wall, clearly whelmed by the level of compulsion this must have required. 
MIKE Haven't heard from you in a couple days. 
GORDY Been busy. 
MIKE Yeah.   I can see that. 
Gordy's obsessed, totally consumed by his project.      He points at a picture of heavily-armed guerrillas. 
GORDY E.L.C. attack platoon... These assholes kill innocent people all the time in Colombia. 
Gordy indicates a newspaper article. 
GORDY Thirteen dead in a bus. (indicates another) A market. Twenty-seven dead. (another) A whole family... Anne and Matt didn't mean shit to them. (indicates The Wolf) Or him. 
Mike interrupts, trying to divert him to something else. 
(CONTINUED) 
76   CONTINUED:                                                           76 
MIKE Hey, we never turned down free beer, and rookie's buying, you believe that? He certified today, he's off probation. 
GORDY (still looking at wall) Ronnie couldn't find a fire with both hands. 
MIKE (smiles) Yeah.   Let's go tell him that. 
we see a CNN anchor with an over-the-shoulder graphic showing the still of the cop from the consulate surveillance camera with "The Wolf" superimposed. 
CNN ANCHOR (V.O.) ... videotape from the terrorist who calls himself The Wolf... 
On screen, we now see a homemade video of a masked figure wearing a camo floppy hat and a hunter's mesh face mask with a strange-smiling face painted on it in camo earth tones. The Wolf's body is hidden shadow, the voice digitally altered to a deep bass growl. 
THE WOLF (V.O.) You thought you killed me. You didn't. I'm still here... 
We see Gordy's demeanor shift, retreating to the obsessive, seething hatred he showed before. 
(CONTINUED) 
83    CONTINUED:                                                      83 
THE WOLF (V.O.) ... I swear that for every freedom fighter you killed, ten Americans will die. And I will pick the time and the place. And I will enjoy it... 
The Wolf slaps his palm for emphasis. 
THE WOLF (V.O.) ... Venceremos. 
The tape ends.    Mike shakes his head. 
MIKE This guy, Quaddafi, that Bin Laden... We never get these assholes. 
OFF Gordy, his spark of life suddenly extinguished... 
83A   EXT. ROW OF TOWNHOUSES (WASHINGTON, D.C.) - DAY                 83A 
The four connected townhouses sit behind gates on a tree- lined street in Georgetown. A sign reads: Latin American Institute. 
83B   INT. LATIN AMERICAN INSTITUTE - BRANDT'S OFFICE - DAY       83B 
Brandt's on the phone.    He's pissed. 
BRANDT ... Senator, the failure of one operation shouldn't cause your committee to question financing everything else we're doing down there... 
DONALD UPDEGRAF, Brandt's number two, enters. 
BRANDT ... I know it looks bad, and I appreciate your support. Together we'll get it done... Yeah. 'bye. (hangs up; to Updegraf) Without his father's money, that asshole'd be keeping bees for a living... What? 
(CONTINUED) 
83B   CONTINUED:                                                         83B 
UPDEGRAF Gordy Pitt's on the phone. 
BRANDT No. 
UPDEGRAF He's called every day. 
BRANDT I don't need it. 
Beat.   Updegraf picks up the phone. 
UPDEGRAF Mr. Pitt, Mr. Brandt'll have to get back to you. 
84    INT. GORDY'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY                         84 
Gordy's mood is dark. It's not improved by hearing the bullshit in Updegraf's reply. 
GORDY Tell him not to bother. 
He slams down the phone. Rips up Brandt's business card. He's alone with his frustration, with his rekindled hatred and rage. OFF Gordy, glaring at the photo of The Wolf on his wall... 
85    INT. AEROPUERTO EL DORADO (BOGOTA) - IMMIGRATION AND               85 CUSTOMS AREA - DAY 
Armed police lead Rottweilers through the newly-arrived passengers. FIND Gordy in line. He wears jeans, polo shirt, Timberlands, carries a backpack. 
Gordy advances to an IMMIGRATION OFFICER, hands over his documents. The agent studies Gordy's passport. 
IMMIGRATION OFFICER Business or pleasure, senor? 
GORDY ... Pleasure. 
The agent looks up at Gordy.         Looks back at the passport. Beat. 
(CONTINUED) 
85   CONTINUED:                                                         85 
IMMIGRATION OFFICER One moment, senor. 
The agent gets the attention of an IMMIGRATION SUPERIOR, and the two of them confer out of earshot a moment. The Superior looks over at Gordy. Then approaches. 
IMMIGRATION SUPERIOR If you would come with me, please. 
86   INT. IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS - OFFICE - DAY                        86 
GORDY Is there a problem? 
The customs Superior closes the door.      Beat. 
IMMIGRATION SUPERIOR We know who you are, Mr. Pitt. 
GORDY Says so right there in my passport. 
IMMIGRATION SUPERIOR We're aware your wife and child were killed in the bombing in New York. (off Gordy's look) We have C.N.N. here, too. (then) It's better for you to visit another country. For your own sake. 
GORDY ... You giving me a choice? 
IMMIGRATION SUPERIOR Yes. But not about staying in Colombia. 
He opens the door, addresses two armed policemen in Spanish. Turning back to Gordy -- 
IMMIGRATION SUPERIOR These men will escort you onto whatever flight you wish. 
He holds out Gordy's passport.     Beat.   Gordy takes it, starts out. As he goes -- 
(CONTINUED) 
The little girl runs back again, and Gordy watches the refugees disappear around the bend. Then turns back uphill and approaches the line the little girl drew in the dirt. Looks down at it. Crossing over means he walks into a world dangerous enough to cause these people to flee for their lives, and... 
Just as Gordy charged into the fire-engulfed tenement past a tide of more sensible rats going the other way, he now steps over the line and advances into Colombia. 
94   EXT. PARQUE NACIONAL LOS KATIOS (COLOMBIA) - DAY/NIGHT         94 
Where the rain forest of Darien continues in Colombia. 
Darkness sets in as Gordy follows the trail downhill.    At night, the JUNGLE'S EVEN NOISIER. When... 
EVERYTHING GOES QUIET. Gordy slows. And suddenly, AUTOMATIC WEAPONS begin to POP somewhere. Not close, but not far, either. A FEW BURSTS, some SINGLE SHOTS -- the call and response of an ambush -- and then SILENCE. And then the nighttime JUNGLE NOISES return. 
As Gordy walks on... 
95   EXT. PARQUE NACIONAL LOS KATIOS - MORNING                      95 
The sun is already cooking the jungle as Gordy reaches a break in the trees, sees a small town ahead. 
96    NEARBY - MOMENTS LATER                                         96 
Gordy has left the trail. He lowers his pants just enough to expose his injured thigh. A bandage covers the wound made by the glass shard. Gordy unwraps the bandage, revealing... 
A wad of cash is hidden inside, along with a photo of Anne and Matt. A long, livid scar marks the wound. 
Gordy studies the photo of Anne and Matt a moment, then removes some cash from the wad and re-wraps the money and photo inside the bandage. 
97    BACK ON TRAIL                                                  97 
Gordy heads into the town. 
98    EXT./INT. CHIVA - NIGHT                                        98 
One of the colorful, wretchedly overcrowded buses that ply Colombia's back-country roads. 
As the chiva jolts and shudders over the dirt road, Gordy sleeps. He's an object of some curiosity -- not only a gringo, but a virtual Gulliver in comparison to the small-statured Colombians pressed in around him. 
99    EXT. FINCA (COLOMBIA) - DAY                                    99 
A sprawling farm/estate deep in the countryside. Beyond the hacienda, we see a military compound containing tents and three heavily camouflaged helicopter shelters. A recently arrived Light Observation Helicopter (LOH) sits on a chopper pad with its rotors still turning. 
100   INT. HACIENDA - DAY                                            100 
Full of manned hi-tech command-and-control and surveillance equipment. A Colombian military operations officer, ROCHA, waits with an aide. 
Brandt arrives with Updegraf. 
BRANDT Find your fucking leak? 
ROCHA Not yet. And it could be your fucking leak. 
(CONTINUED) 
100   CONTINUED:                                                      100 
BRANDT All due respect, Noel, it's not likely... And we don't need the whole world looking into what we're doing down here... We find the son-of-a-bitch again, we're bypassing protocols... 
Updegraf has had papers handed to him and interrupts -- 
UPDEGRAF Check this out. 
He hands a paper to Brandt.    Brandt reads it. 
BRANDT Jesus Christ... 
UPDEGRAF (to Rocha) The man whose wife and son died in New York. One of your units found his passport and credit cards on some gunrunners near Panama. Gunrunners say they left him alive. 
BRANDT What, he thinks he can get The Wolf himself? 
ROCHA We have too much time and too many people invested to have a loose cannon walking around. 
BRANDT (beat; hands papers to Rocha) Throw out the net. Have him picked up... Just make sure no one kills him. 
FLASH-CUT TO: 
101   EXPLOSION                                                       101 
Boom!   An ENORMOUS EXPLOSION.      And... 
102   EXT./INT. CHIVA - NIGHT                                         102 
Gordy bolts awake from the nightmare with a scream. He looks around at the startled faces in the crowded bus, unsure where he is for a moment before he gets his bearings. The dream lingers, depressing him. 
103   ANGLE - AHEAD OF CHIVA                                          103 
An oncoming bus flashes its headlights. As the buses pass, the ONCOMING DRIVER yells to Gordy's chiva driver. 
ONCOMING DRIVER Inspecion militar. Chequeo de papeles. 
104   SECOND CHIVA                                                    104 
keeps going. Gordy's chiva slows to a crawl, and the Driver calls back. 
GORDY'S CHIVA DRIVER Inspecion militar. Chequeo de papeles. 
Various passengers gather their things and begin to disembark in a hurry. To anyone who'll answer -- 
GORDY Habla Ingles?... Que pasa? 
A MAN IN A YANKEES CAP is among the people getting off. He answers in accented English. 
MAN IN YANKEES CAP There is a military checkpoint up the road. They inspect everyone's papers. 
105   BUS                                                             105 
starts to pick up speed again. Gordy gets off just in time. To the Man in the Yankees Cap -- 
GORDY Where are all of you going? 
MAN IN YANKEES CAP We walk around. 
GORDY Guerrilla bastards. 
MAN IN YANKEES CAP No... Military... To stop guerrillas. 
Beat.   Gordy finishes the tourniquet, when he sees... 
117   YOUNG MAN                                                      117 
has left the group and emerged from the river in a different place to avoid the mines. 
Gordy's eyes go to something glistening in front of the young man -- a taut nylon line ten inches off the ground. The kid's about to hit it. Gordy shouts -- 
GORDY No!   Alto! 
The young man hears the alarm in Gordy's voice and stops... But not before he plants his next step, and... 
The trip wire bows against his shin, and... 
Gordy ducks, covers the Man in the Yankees Cap, and... 
Nothing happens. The young man just stands there, frozen in position, his leg still bowing the line. 
(CONTINUED) 
117   CONTINUED:                                                    117 
Using the Zippo again to light his way, Gordy advances to the young man. He follows the trip wire to where a Coca- Cola can hangs from a nearby tree. On closer inspection, Gordy can see the can is sleeved around a grenade. There's no pin in the grenade. The can keeps the grenade's arming spoon in place. The trip wire's designed to yank the can off, allowing the grenade to explode at chest level... And the can's almost off. 
Gordy burns through the monofilament trip wire. Then carefully slides the Coke can back over the grenade. 
118   MAN IN YANKEES CAP - MOMENTS LATER                            118 
When Gordy returns, the man's dead.    OFF Gordy, looking down at the NY logo on the cap... 
119   EXT./INT. ANOTHER CHIVA - DAY                                 119 
Gordy sees a sign for a town as the chiva rumbles along. 
He pulls out his map. 
120   INSERT - MAP                                                  120 
Gordy finds the town, which lies along a river. He traces a road from the town. The road runs south through the town of Mompos, and eventually reaches Caguan, the ELC capital. 
121   BACK TO SCENE                                                 121 
A COLOMBIAN WOMAN is looking over Gordy's shoulder. 
COLOMBIAN WOMAN No autobusses para este lugar. Solamente el barco en el rio. 
She leans over, traces the river, which also runs to Caguan. 
COLOMBIAN WOMAN El rio. 
122   EXT. FERRY DOCK - DAY                                         122 
The FERRY'S WHISTLE TOOTS.    Lines are cast off. 
(CONTINUED) 
122   CONTINUED:                                                      122 
Two plainclothes federales have been watching the ferry load and now relax their vigil. One man holds a Xerox of Gordy's passport photo. The other bites into an empanada, which breaks open and spills its contents down the front of his shirt. His partner finds it funny. He doesn't. And while their attention's occupied... 
Gordy hurries by, oblivious to the federales' presence, and just manages to hop onto the ferry as it pulls away. 
123   EXT. FERRY - DAY                                                123 
The ferry's the only means of travel south, and it's packed. Gordy picks his way through. The only other gringo on the boat is a geek in a plaid shirt and gimme hat that says "Deerborn." The geek, PHILIP ARMSTRONG, looks like a talker, and Gordy tries to avoid eye contact. He's too late. 
ARMSTRONG Hey, yo, dude, here's a seat, man! 
GORDY No, that's okay -- 
But Armstrong's already throwing a bag off the bench. 
ARMSTRONG I was hoping for someone I could communicate with. 
He sees Gordy hasn't moved. 
ARMSTRONG Only room's at the back near the bano, and I'd advise against it, unless you like poop. 
Beat.   Gordy sits.   Immediately -- 
ARMSTRONG Philip Armstrong. Assiniboia, Sasketchewan, Canada. (indicates his hat) Deerborn Heavy Equipment. 
GORDY ... Gordy Pitt. 
ARMSTRONG Hey, howya doing? I love Germany. 
(CONTINUED) 
123   CONTINUED:                                                     123 
GORDY Austria.   American now. 
ARMSTRONG I love America. Never been to Austria. Where from in America would that be? 
GORDY New York City. 
ARMSTRONG I don't like New York City. Buildings're too big. What kinda work you in? 
GORDY (hesitates, then) Coffee. I buy beans. 
ARMSTRONG Can't drink caffeine. Makes my stomach do the rumba. I like that commercial guy with the sombrero and the mule, though. Headed upstream, eh? Where to? 
GORDY Caguan. 
ARMSTRONG ... You've never been to Caguan, eh? 
BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! A water tower, the Mompos fire station and the town's power supply are direct hits. 
WHUMP, WHUMP, WHUMP... 
153   INT. JAIL - CELLS                                              153 
People react to the sounds of the MORTAR ATTACK on the town. The lights go out. Brandt, Rocha and their men quickly lock the guerrillas in their cell and head out. 
154   EXT. JAIL                                                      154 
As MORTARS CONTINUE to fall on the rest of the town, the unit of guerrilla infiltrators open up on the front of the jail with LAW ROCKETS. 
155   EXT./INT. JAIL                                                 155 
KA-BOOM! The front door and wall of the jail disintegrate under the multiple LAW attack. 
156   NEW ANGLE                                                      156 
Brandt, Rocha and the soldiers, approaching the front door inside, are hammered by the massive concussion of the BLAST and flung across the room, apparently dead. 
157   ANOTHER ANGLE                                                  157 
The powerful, concussive shock-wave channels into the cell area. Gordy's slightly protected by a wall. Armstrong, standing at the bars, is thrown into the opposite wall and knocked unconscious. 
158   GUERRILLAS                                                     158 
charge inside with AKs BLAZING.   Surviving soldiers and federales SHOOT back. 
The blasts have caused fires in the building. Severed wires spark, creating more fire. Flames begin to spread through the tinder-dry structure. 
(CONTINUED) 
158   CONTINUED:                                                      158 
The guerrillas take out the soldiers and federales, with few casualties to themselves. They make their way toward the cell area. 
EXPLODING AMMO and stored FUEL CANS accelerate the fire. 
159   NEW ANGLE                                                       159 
The guerrillas reach the cells. Two men see Gordy and draw down on him. The others move to the next cell. 
Guerrillas plant small explosive charges on the hinges of the cell containing their two captured comrades. Beat. The HINGES BLOW. The beaten man and the rebel with him are freed, and the guerrillas quickly retreat the way they came. 
Gordy sees flames spreading into the cell area. 
160   GUERRILLAS                                                      160 
exit the fiery jail past Brandt.    We see Brandt's not dead. 
161   EXT. MOMPOS STREET - OUTSIDE JAIL                               161 
A truck pulls up. The guerrillas get in.    The TRUCK SCREECHES OUT as... 
162   4X4                                                             162 
full of sicarios SKIDS onto the street, far ahead of the truck. The sicario driving punches it, and... 
163   TWO TRUCKS                                                      163 
ROAR toward each other. A game of chicken. With GUNS. Men in both vehicles OPEN UP -- the sicarios with magnums and Uzis, the guerrillas with AKs. SLUGS RIP through automotive steel. Casualties are taken. When... 
164   SICARIO                                                         164

The 4x4 catapults completely over the guerrillas' truck, disintegrating into spare parts and dead occupants, as... 
167   GUERRILLAS                                                            167 
ROAR off. 
168   EXT./INT. JAIL                                                        168 
A severely-dazed Brandt, bleeding from the nose and ears, slowly gets to his knees, crawls out of the burning building and collapses outside. 
169   INT. GORDY AND ARMSTRONG'S CELL                                       169 
There's fire and smoke everywhere. Gordy picks up the metal bunk and slams it against a wall. Slams it again. Breaks the metal apart. Then levers a long side rail in the cell door. He heaves. Heaves again. The fire's licking at him, but Gordy's undeterred. He heaves again, and... 
This time, the door gives. Gordy picks up Armstrong's cap, then picks up Armstrong, who's starting to come around. Puts Armstrong over his shoulders in a fireman's carry. 
GORDY Don't breathe. 
ARMSTRONG (weakly) You're not running through the fire, eh? 
GORDY Close your mouth. 
Because running through the fire is just what Gordy's gonna do. As he disappears into the flames... 
170   EXT. JAIL - NIGHT                                                     170 
The town's in complete chaos.         There are fires everywhere. (CONTINUED) 
170   CONTINUED:                                                     170 
Still stunned and bleeding, Brandt looks from where he lies on the ground as... 
Gordy bursts out of the inferno carrying Armstrong. They're singed and smoking, but they're alive. Gordy drops Armstrong, pats himself and Armstrong down, knocking out the burning embers on their clothes and hair, when... 
Gordy's eyes meet Brandt's. The two men hold the look for a moment. If Brandt could speak, he'd be yelling at Gordy to stop, not to go on. And Gordy knows it. But Gordy's not stopping. Picks up Armstrong again and moves off toward the waterfront. 
171   EXT. MOMPOS WATERFRONT - NIGHT                                 171 
The Supervisor just looks at him, assessing Gordy's face for signs he's lying. Gordy's expression stays the same. 
Felix respectfully interjects.     It's almost a plea. 
FELIX (in Spanish) We need to fix the equipment. We have delivery deadlines to meet. 
(CONTINUED) 
177   CONTINUED:                                                    177 
A long beat. The ELC Supervisor hands the travel pass back to Gordy. In a hard tone to Felix -- 
ELC SUPERVISOR (in Spanish) He's your responsibility. Don't let him out of your sight. 
FELIX Si.   Gracias. 
As Felix leads Gordy away... 
178   INT./EXT. LAND CRUISER (CAGUAN) - DAY                         178 
Gordy and Felix pull away from the Supervisor's H.Q. Felix resumes his former tone of command. 
FELIX The Supervisor made you my responsibility... You don't go anywhere without me, you understand? 
GORDY No problemo. 
Gordy peers out the window intently as they drive, looking for a lucky break, looking for The Wolf, searching the face of every man. He doesn't see The Wolf, but what he does see surprises him. The ELC Supervisor was right: Caguan's no Mompos. It's a third- world town, armed troops are visible, and there's a lot of bad shit behind Colombia's revolutionaries, but here the streets are calm and orderly. It's quiet, almost eerie, as people go about their business. OFF Gordy, seeing another side of the guerrillas... 
179   INT./EXT. LAND CRUISER/COUNTRY ROAD - DAY                     179 
Felix turns off at the entrance to a lane leading to the plantation. The entrance is guarded by a 4X4 "Rat Patrol" assault truck and four heavily armed ELC guerrillas. 
GORDY The E.L.C. guards your coffee beans? 
Felix thinks he's joking. Until he looks over and sees Gordy's actually being sincere. 
(CONTINUED) 
179   CONTINUED:                                                  179 
FELIX ... Coffee beans? Shit. Armstrong didn't tell you much... 
180   INT./EXT. LAND CRUISER - PLANTATION - DAY                   180 
They approach a hacienda and outbuildings. The accoutrements of agriculture are present -- tractors, sheds, cats, etc. -- but clearly, this is no family farm. There are lots of serious-looking men around. More ELC guerrillas stand guard. 
181   FELIX                                                       181 
stops the car. He and Gordy get out. Felix begins leading Gordy toward two rows of long, open-walled sheds. 
FELIX The problem's with the diesel generators. The sons-of-bitches keep breaking down. 
182   NEW ANGLE                                                   182 
They pass four very large pits, where green leaves steep in a thick, foul-smelling liquid. 
FELIX We're using portables to keep production going, but they don't supply enough power to the heat lamps, and we have to dry a lot of... 'coffee beans.' 
183   ANOTHER ANGLE                                               183 
They're now walking between the two rows of sheds, where portable gas GENERATORS THRUM, and... 
Gordy can see long, wide platforms inside. Above the platforms are multiple arrays of powerful heat lamps. Spread out and drying beneath them is a half-acre or two of converted cocaine. 
184   IN ANOTHER SHED                                             184 
workers pack and wrap one-kilo bricks of coke for shipment. 
185   GORDY AND FELIX                                                185 
approach the two giant diesel generators. 
FELIX We can fix anything, but these keep dying on us... You'll start now. I'll have tools brought to you. (beat) Armstrong's a magician with them. Let's hope you have his skill. 
Felix walks over to a guerrilla with an AK-47 and speaks to him. Then goes. Whereupon the guerrilla crosses to Gordy and takes up a sentry position over him. 
186   SAME SCENE - LATER                                             186 
Gordy has the diesels partially dismantled. The guerrilla sentry is still right there. Felix returns. 
FELIX Well? 
Gordy has to think of something fast.    Beat.   He throws a machine part against a wall angrily. 
GORDY I can't work with these pieces of junk. 
FELIX Junk? These generators cost a fortune. 
GORDY Then treat them that way. 
FELIX (beat, then) Armstrong always fixes them. 
GORDY Armstrong wants your money. He makes them work, but he doesn't fix them... To do this right, we gotta order parts from Europe. In the meantime, I can make something temporary. There must be a machine shop in town. 
FELIX ... Yes. 
(CONTINUED) 
186   CONTINUED:                                                          186 
Gordy stands. 
GORDY Let's go. 
OFF Felix, forced to acquiesce... 
187   INT./EXT. LAND CRUISER (CAGUAN) - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY               187 
Felix is driving. Again, Gordy uses the opportunity to look for The Wolf. It's a long-shot, and he knows it. But it's all he can do. 
Gordy STARTS the CAR and drives after the Suburban. 
195   EXT./INT. LAND CRUISER (CAGUAN) - NIGHT                          195 
Gordy follows the Suburban as Felix rambles -- 
FELIX ... I'll take her to a small restaurant... We'll have lobster and drink lots of wine... I'll get her drunk... We'll drive home... I'll carry her inside... I'll kiss her... And then, I'll screw her in my bed... 
The Suburban pulls up next to a house.       There are armed guerrilla guards outside. 
FELIX ... And when I am done screwing her, she'll never want to look at another man again... 
Gordy drives past the house as the Beaten Man and the guerrilla with him get out of the Suburban and start carrying the beer inside. And a moment later... 
Felix comes around with a start. 
FELIX What the fuck are you doing?! 
He unholsters the 9mm and points it at Gordy. 
GORDY Hey, easy... What's the problem? 
(CONTINUED) 
195   CONTINUED:                                                      195 
FELIX You're going the wrong goddamn way! 
GORDY I am?... Looks different in the dark... 
FELIX Turn around! 
Gordy turns the car around.     Felix keeps the gun on him. 
FELIX You drive where I say... Or the Supervisor will have us both shot. 
Gordy drives back. They approach the Suburban and the house once more. This time it's on Felix' side. Felix gives the guerrilla guards a wave as they go by, and... 
Gordy's eyes go to something he couldn't see coming the other way: a large propane tank next to the house. 
196   EXT. PLANTATION - VARIOUS SHOTS - NIGHT                         196 
The work in the sheds continues.    Heat lamps dry down the long tables of coke. 
197   GUERRILLA GUARDS                                                197 
are more vigilant at night, patrolling the grounds with posted teams. 
198   WORK LIGHTS                                                     198 
illuminate the two big diesel generators as Gordy continues his overhaul. He has two sentries now. One wears a combat vest, and as Gordy works, his eyes go to the grenades hanging on the vest's front. 
199   EXT. PLANTATION - DIESEL GENERATORS - DAY                       199 
The sun's over the yardarm now, blazing hot, and Gordy's still working under the watchful eyes of the guards. 
Nearby, a group of guerrillas is playing soccer, when... 
(CONTINUED) 
199   CONTINUED:                                                    199 
A man is injured, and his teammates call for one of Gordy's guards to substitute. The man in the combat vest responds. The game is shirts and skins, and he's joining the skins. Puts down his AK, strips off his combat vest and shirt, and runs in. 
Gordy's eyes go to the vest and the attached grenades. With the other guard still watching him closely, however, there's nothing Gordy can do. 
200   SAME SCENE - LATER                                            200 
The soccer game rages back and forth. Suddenly, an open man gets the ball. Breaks toward the goal. 
Gordy sees the player about to go one-on-one with the goalie. He cheers the action loudly, whereupon... 
Gordy's guard turns to see what's happening, and... 
Gordy grabs a grenade.    Almost gets it into a tool box, when... 
The player kicks wide, the guard looks back, and... 
Gordy covers the clattering of the grenade's dropping into the tool box by picking up a large wrench... But the grenade's still visible as now... 
Felix comes around the corner. He's sleepy and hungover. And pissed by Gordy's lack of progress. 
FELIX It's afternoon. Yesterday, you said it would only take two more hours. 
Gordy wipes his hands on a rag, throws it on the grenade. 
GORDY I have this one ready to go. 
Gordy reaches up and hits the start button on the GENERATOR. It SPUTTERS, but won't catch. Felix just looks at him. Gordy makes an adjustment, and... 
This time,   the ENGINE TURNS OVER. PURRS like new. The heat lamps   brighten in a row of sheds. Felix winces as the DIESEL   ROAR makes the hangover hammers in his head pound even   harder. 
FELIX What about the other one? 
(CONTINUED) 
200   CONTINUED:                                                            200 
GORDY I just need another part from town, and it's five more minutes. 
FELIX ... Shit.     Fine. Let's go. 
Gordy grabs the tool box. 
FELIX Why're you bringing the tool box? 
GORDY The old part's in there. I need to match it, and it's all greasy. 
Felix buys it and heads off.          As Gordy follows him... 
The attractive woman we saw earlier playing with the children now walks up holding the hand of a small boy.    A guerrilla waves them on. The woman and boy hustle by, glancing at the face of this big gringo in trouble as they pass. They hurry on toward the nearby "Cine." 
OFF Gordy, as the guerrilla indicates for him to start walking to the truck... 
213   INT. BAR - NIGHT                                               213 
The guerrilla patrol has taken Gordy to Felix, still sitting with Berta in his lap. 
FELIX Are you trying to get us both killed? 
GORDY I went for a walk. I figured you wanted to be alone with Berta. 
(CONTINUED) 
213   CONTINUED:                                                  213 
FELIX (to the guerrillas; in Spanish) I'll make sure he's on a shorter leash. 
The patrol leader looks at Felix hard. Then nods. The guerrillas go. Felix dumps Berta onto her feet, stands. Felix looks at Gordy, shakes his head. 
FELIX Shit... 
214   INT. LAND CRUISER - NIGHT                                   214 
Gordy and Felix get in. 
FELIX You're working all night, Beckmann. That generator gets fixed, and you're out of my hair in the morning. 
Felix jams the car in drive. 
Gordy looks down, sees the spoon of the grenade exposed. As he readjusts his shirt to cover the spoon... 
215   EXT. PLANTATION - DIESEL GENERATORS - NIGHT                 215 
Felix is right there supervising for himself as Gordy finishes working. Gordy stands. He stares hopefully at the MACHINE. Then pushes the starter, and... VRROOM! The heat lights in the second row of sheds brighten. 
Gordy turns to Felix. 
GORDY That make you happy? 
No response. 
GORDY Where's my money? 
FELIX You'll get it in the morning. 
216   INT. HACIENDA - STOREROOM - NIGHT                              216 
Felix yanks the dangling cord and turns on the lights. The room's a mess. All kinds of rubbish. There's a washtub sink. There's a cot. 
GORDY This where Armstrong stays? 
FELIX This is where you stay... A boat will take you down river at seven. 
Felix closes the door. We hear a LOCK TURNING. Gordy moves to the door and tries it. It's definitely locked. Through a small window, he can see the lights in the sheds and the ever-vigilant nighttime ELC sentries patrolling the grounds. The DIESELS ROAR in the b.g. 
Gordy turns back. Readjusts the grenade digging into his belly, then hooks it back inside his pants. He turns off the light. Moves to the adobe wall opposite the door. THROUGH another small window, he can see it's dark in this direction. 
Gordy rummages through the refuse lying around the room. We see some rubber tubing. We see some rope. Gordy finally finds a piece of sharp metal. He moves to the wall with the window. With the DIESELS covering the noise, Gordy starts chiseling away at the adobe. 
217   EXT. PLANTATION - NIGHT                                        217 
The big-wheeled guerrilla Suburban drives in. 
218   INT. STOREROOM                                                 218 
Gordy is making slow progress through the wall, when he hears the VEHICLE arrive. He moves to the window by the door and looks out. Sees the Suburban. Four guerrillas are getting out, including the Beaten Man. Felix meets them. The Beaten Man exchanges words with Felix. Felix indicates Gordy's room. As the Beaten Man continues to question Felix... 
Gordy realizes he's fucked. He can't get through the wall fast enough. His eyes go to water dripping from a pipe leading to the washtub sink. He moves to it. Finds the water pipe underneath that feeds the tap. Cranks shut the master valve on the pipe. Wraps his hands around the pipe and pulls. Nothing. Jams his feet against the wall for leverage and pulls harder... And this time, he yanks the pipe free from the sink. He finds the rubber hose. Fits an end over the pipe. 
(CONTINUED) 
218   CONTINUED:                                                         218 
Quickly lashes it on with some wire. Then cranks on the master valve. High-pressure water streams from the hose. 
Gordy sneaks a peek out the window. The Beaten Man's still questioning Felix. The sound of the hose water is being covered by the DIESELS. 
Gordy crosses the room, extending the hose to the hole he's made in the wall. He aims the stream at the hole. Thumbs the end of the hose to make the water jet even harder... And watches the jet begin eating away at the old adobe and brick, just as it ate through the crumbling plaster in the Spanish Harlem tenement. 
219   EXT. PLANTATION                                                    219 
The Beaten Man finishes with Felix. Felix begins leading the guerrillas toward the storeroom. 
220   INT. STOREROOM                                                     220 
Gordy's made progress, but hasn't broken through yet. And he won't, not in enough time. Under his breath -- 
GORDY Come on, baby... come on, baby... 
And just then... 
221   EXT. PLANTATION                                                    221 
WHAM-WHAM-WHAM, one of the DIESELS Gordy repaired suffers a spectacularly loud internal breakdown. The heat lights dim in a row of sheds. Felix and the guerrillas stop to see what's happening. At which point, the generator now BURSTS into FLAMES. 
222   BACK TO GORDY                                                      222 
He smiles. 
GORDY Just in time... 
And we realize that he'd planned on the diversion, as... 
The water jet breaks through.      The hole's still small. Gordy begins to widen it. 
223   EXT. PLANTATION                                               223 
Felix, the Beaten Man and the other guerrillas resume their march toward the storeroom. 
267   GORDY'S POV                                                          267 
This time, when Gordy opens his eyes, there's no blurriness. It's a new day. He's better. Selena's walking to him with a tray. The SHELL BRACELET CLACKS as she approaches. 
SELENA I brought you food. 
268   INT. UNDERGROUND BUNKER - DAY                                        268 
Gordy slowly sits up.       Beat. 
GORDY Why feed me?    Why not just kill me? 
SELENA Are you so anxious to die? 
Gordy doesn't have an answer.         Beat.    He tastes the meal. 
(CONTINUED) 
268   CONTINUED:                                                       268 
GORDY ... Thanks. 
Selena watches him a moment, troubled by something. 
SELENA The men in jail with you in Mompos... They say you talked to a man from the C.I.A. 
GORDY I'm not one of them.   I'm here for my own reasons. 
Selena watches him another moment. Decides he's telling the truth. She reaches into a skirt pocket, then extends her hand toward Gordy. He looks up. She's holding the photo of Anne and Matt. Beat. Gordy takes the photo. Looks at his wife and son. Selena sits next to him. Another beat. Then, off the photo... 
SELENA Claudio used to be a teacher. I was a medical aid worker. We met in Guatemala, in an Indian village called Guamaunco. We were married there. Sophia, our daughter was born there. Claudio was kind and loving, and we were happy... We were there four years when the civil war broke out... The guerrillas were all around us, but left us alone... Then they made an attack on the army nearby. The next night, soldiers came to our village. They were led by American 'advisors'... They accused us of helping the rebels. Our women were raped. Our men were tortured. Our homes were burned... We crawled out into the fields, but they threw grenades, and Sophia... 
Selena hesitates, choking back her emotions. 
SELENA ... my baby girl was hit by shrapnel... she bled to death in Claudio's arms. 
She looks into Gordy's eyes. The look says she understands and shares Gordy's pain because she's suffered her own painful loss. She looks away again.

268    CONTINUED:    (2)                                               268 
SELENA Claudio joined the guerrillas. When that war ended, we moved to the next war, and the next... Each fight has only deepened his hatred. And poisoned his soul. (beat) He's unable to love anything anymore... 
GORDY Why are you still here? 
SELENA Because I know he was a good man, who's been consumed by rage because of what he lost... Just like you. 
GORDY I'm not like him. 
SELENA Not yet. 
GORDY He kills innocent people. (then) He's planning to kill more. 
Beat. Selena suddenly stands, uncomfortable, not wanting to discuss it. She goes to the door and knocks. OFF Gordy, as the door opens, and Selena exits...

GORDY Which building? 
SELENA I don't know.

GORDY We'd never make it.

GORDY How many more kids have to die? And for what? 
SELENA ... I'm his wife...

275   INT. AIRPORT (QUITO, ECUADOR) - DAY                           275 
Passengers are lined up to board a flight to Mexico City. FIND a man in line wearing a crisp business suit and tie. The clothes, a haircut and horn-rims have made The Wolf nearly unrecognizable.

277   EXT. ELC JUNGLE VILLAGE - NIGHT                               277 
Water drips from jungle leaves and the eaves of buildings. We see the bustling life of the place, the families, the women and children who live with and support the well-organized and high-tech guerrilla military. The village is simple but decidedly not primitive. These people have generators, a satellite dish and a school with a computer. At night, the school is a TV room. Right now on the tube Daffy's getting his beak blown off. 
278   SOLDIER                                                       278

The Blackhawks, black and menacing, sit on an illuminated tarmac as: 
Heavily armed troops in black uniforms and assault vests load up. 
Door gunners check mini-guns. 
Ground crews yank arming ribbons on rocket pods. 
A co-pilot in a specially rigged helmet tests his forward mini-gun: wherever he looks, the gun points. 
Pilots finish checklists, and... 
Chopper ENGINES start WHINING. ROTORS begin to TURN. The noise mounts to an incredible ROAR. 
282   ANGLE - L.O.H.                                                  282 
The small helicopter's rotors are also turning. Brandt stands at the chopper door with Updegraf. Slams the magazine on a Glock .45, making sure it's in solid, then slides the pistol into his shoulder holster. He checks his watch. Loud, to Updegraf -- 
BRANDT It's time to make The Wolf howl. 
He takes a last drag on his cigarette, passes the butt to Updegraf to finish and gets in the rear of the L.O.H. as Updegraf scoots clear. 
283   L.O.H.                                                          283

285   INT. UNDERGROUND BUNKER - NIGHT                                 285 
Gordy's on the bed. The guard lets Selena in. She crosses toward the food tray near Gordy... but she's not there for the tray. Moves past it to Gordy's leg and, to Gordy's surprise, begins unlocking the shackle. 
SELENA We're going with you. 
When Gordy's free -- 
GORDY How do we get out? 
She hands Gordy a length of pipe secreted in her dress. 
SELENA The guard is the only one close. When we're past him, we can slip into the jungle. Mauro's waiting for us there. 
286   EXT. SKY - HELICOPTERS - NIGHT                                  286

Selena, Mauro and Gordy reach the fast-flowing water. 
SELENA We have to swim. 
Gordy spies two empty fuel cans nearby. He gets the cans, throws them in. Then picks up Mauro. 
GORDY Go! 
Selena jumps in. Gordy and Mauro follow. They swim for the fuel cans. Gordy, with Mauro clinging to his neck and still clutching the doll, gets an arm over one can. Selena just manages to grab the other. 
308   SOLDIER'S POV (NIGHT-VISION)                                      308

BULLETS WHIP the water around Gordy, Mauro and Selena. They hide behind the cans. BULLETS PING OFF the METAL. 
They're swept through some rocks, blocking them from the Soldier, who FIRES anyway. BULLETS CHIP the STONE. 
There's one more clear shot after the rocks. They're almost around a bend. The Soldier aims. BANGS! And... 
Selena's hit.      Gasps.   Gordy looks over, calls. 
GORDY You okay? 
Selena endures the pain.      Hides it behind iron eyes. 
SELENA Your hired soldiers can't shoot.

The village is a silent, smoking ruin. Everyone who lived there is dead. Troops check the faces of the bodies of the men against the freeze-frame of The Wolf outside the Colombian consulate in New York. 
The L.O.H. lands.     Brandt's met by the Ground Commander.

GROUND COMMANDER No sign of The Wolf. Two people, possibly a third, got away. They're in the river. 
Brandt moves back to the L.O.H., gets in.   A moment later, the chopper's up and away. 
311   EXT. RIVER                                                     311 
Gordy, Mauro and Selena are still floating, hanging onto the cans, when they hear the sound of a HELICOPTER. Gordy looks, sees the L.O.H. flying downstream ten feet off the river. 
GORDY Under the water! (to Mauro) Uno, dos, tres... 
He takes a big breath and holds it. Mauro understands and does the same. They go under. So does Selena. 
312   INT. L.O.H.                                                    312 
The Pilot scans the river with his night-vision goggles. Brandt studies the night-vision monitor in front of him. There's nothing but river. 
They zoom by the two fuel cans, but see nothing. 
313   EXT. RIVER                                                     313

The chopper rounds a bend in the river... And there are the two armed guerrilla "customs" boats. The boats open up, and the L.O.H. Pilot banks away. 
315   EXT. RIVER                                                     315 
The L.O.H. sweeps back in on the customs boats. ROCKETS LAUNCH from the pods. One customs BOAT goes up in a massive EXPLOSION. The other boat scoots. 
316   INT. L.O.H.                                                            316 
The Pilot sees the second boat go. 
L.O.H. PILOT Not tonight. 
He sweeps in again. Triggers more missiles. We watch the second customs boat go the way of the first. 
Brandt only cares about the primary target. 
BRANDT They couldn't have made it this far. Go back upstream. 
As the chopper banks... 
317   EXT. RIVER                                                             317 
Gordy hears the L.O.H. again.          The three of them duck again, and... 
WHOOM! The CHOPPER ZIPS by just overhead. And continues on. A moment later, Gordy, Mauro and Selena re-surface. OFF them, as the copper recedes upriver... 
318   EXT. RIVER - DAWN                                                      318 
Gordy and Selena float side-by-side, still holding onto the cans. Mauro's asleep on Gordy's back, his arms around Gordy's neck. Weakened by her wound, Selena keeps bobbing below the surface. Gordy pulls her up. 
GORDY Hang on. We just have to keep floating a little bit more... 
Suddenly, in the growing light, Gordy sees Selena's blood in the water and realizes she's wounded. 
GORDY You were shot. 
SELENA ... I'm okay. 
GORDY We gotta get you outta the river. 
319   GORDY                                                                  319 
kicks them all to shore. 
SELENA I don't recognize anything... I saw only parts of the building... I'm sorry. 
Phipps wants to keep her positive and willing. 
PHIPPS That's okay.   We'll keep trying. 
SELENA I think   it's a public place. He said he   wanted the people of America   to feel the terror. 'Terror   is all they understand.' He said   it over and over... 
PHIPPS (to Dray) Double up on public venues: museums, theaters, transport... Put in all the extra undercover we can. 
Selena looks over at her son sleeping in Gordy's arms. She lovingly brushes the hair off his forehead, rattling her seashells. The leather doll is about to fall from Mauro's fingers. Selena takes the doll and puts it into her bag. Then looks out at the passing scenery. OFF Selena, in the land of her husband's enemy -- 
329   EXT. GEORGETOWN STREET - DAY                                     329 
The convoy slows outside the Latin American Institute. An attached garage opens. 
330   INT. GOVERNMENT SUBURBAN                                         330

GORDY Where're we going? 
BRANDT Inter-agency headquarters for our efforts in Latin America. 
PHIPPS It's secure, and we can coordinate all departments here. 
OFF which, as they're swallowed up by the dark garage -- 
331   INT. LATIN AMERICAN INSTITUTE - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY              331 
Brandt, Phipps, Dray, Selena and Gordy -- along with the rest of the entourage -- walk through the interagency nerve center. Gordy carries Mauro, still asleep. 
They stop at the door to a large conference room. Selena's ushered in. Gordy starts to follow. Phipps stops him. 
PHIPPS My people will debrief you in another room... We'll take the boy to a safe house across the street... He'll be well cared for. 
Gordy exchanges a look with Selena. Beat. She nods her reluctant approval. Gordy hands the boy to an agent. 
332   INT./EXT. LOCKUP GARAGE - DAY                                    332 
Claudio opens the door of a cheap rental garage in an old commercial strip. He steps inside. There's a rental van and a big Ducati motorbike against a wall. Claudio straps a black bag onto the bike, then rolls it out and shuts the garage. Pulls on helmet and STARTS the BIKE. As Claudio speeds into traffic -- 
333   INT. LATIN AMERICAN INSTITUTE - LARGE CONFERENCE ROOM -          333 DAY 
Selena is seated at a table covered with photographs, Washington, D.C. coffee table books, guide books, etc. Brandt, Phipps, et al stand around her. Phipps flips through the pages of a large coffee table book for Selena to see. 
(CONTINUED) 
333   CONTINUED:                                                        333 
SELENA No... No... No... 
That book's done. 
SELENA I'm sorry. 
PHIPPS That's okay. 
He grabs another.    Opens it to the first photo. 
SELENA No... 
334   INT. LATIN AMERICAN INSTITUTE - "THE WOLF" ROOM - DAY             334 
A small conference room devoted to everything having to do with the interagency interest in The Wolf. Photos of evidence, time lines, charts, etc. cover the walls. 
Gordy's tired, being debriefed by two FBI AGENTS. 
FBI AGENT #1 ... Did Claudio leave with anyone else? 
GORDY I was underground. I couldn't see anything. 
FBI AGENT #1 Did you hear anything about his contacts in the United States? 
GORDY No. 
335   INT./EXT. WASHINGTON LOCATIONS - MONTAGE - DAY                    335 
Security tightens all over the city.    Among the images we see: 
A forklift places huge planters -- really decorative barricades -- to re-route traffic near vital buildings. 
336   UNDERCOVER PEOPLE                                                 336 
with earpieces patrol public structures.       Some lead dogs that sniff for explosives. 
336A   EXT. WASHINGTON, D.C. - STREETS - DAY                                336A 
Claudio weaves the Ducati through heavy traffic. 
337    INT. LATIN AMERICAN INSTITUTE - LARGE CONFERENCE ROOM                337 - DAY 
Phipps flips to the last photo in the book. 
SELENA ... No... 
He reaches for another book. As he does, he topples a stack. Selena's eyes fix on one book cover. 
SELENA He had that book! Let me see it! 
Phipps hands it to her. It's a guidebook to Washington. Selena flips through it. Stops at a photo. 
338    CLOSE ON PHOTO                                                       338 
It's of the redesigned lobby of Union Station. 
FBI AGENT #1 Number eleven, small seashell with a hole in it... That was found in the getaway car used in the bombing in New York. 
OFF Gordy's face... 
345   FLASHBACK - SELENA'S SEASHELL BRACELET                            345 
There's a gap where one of the shells is missing. 
346   BACK TO SCENE (PRESENT)                                        346 
GORDY Shit... 
347   INT. LATIN AMERICAN INSTITUTE - VARIOUS SHOTS                  347 
Gordy blasts through the building.    As he runs... 
348   FLASHBACK - ELC JUNGLE VILLAGE                                 348 
Selena expertly flicks the safety off on the AK-47. 
349   FLASHBACK - FBI INCIDENT CENTER                                349 
Phipps addresses Gordy. 
PHIPPS We think the bomb was triggered by a cell phone. 
JUMP CUT: 
350   CONTINUE FLASHBACK                                             350 
PHIPPS Did you see a cell phone when you ran into him? 
GORDY No. 
351   FLASHBACK - ELC JUNGLE VILLAGE                                 351 
Selena and Claudio argue inside the house. Selena slaps the back of one hand into the palm of the other. 
352   FLASHBACK - THE WOLF'S VIDEO TAPE                              352 
The Wolf does the same hand slap. 
353   EXT. LATIN AMERICAN INSTITUTE - DAY                            353 
Selena emerges with the two CIA agents. 
354   ANGLE - DOWN BLOCK                                             354 
Claudio sits on his parked motorcycle. He sees Selena emerge. Drops his helmet visor and STARTS the BIKE. 
355   INT. LATIN AMERICAN INSTITUTE - LARGE CONFERENCE ROOM             355 - DAY 
Gordy bursts in, sees Selena's not there. 
GORDY Where's Selena?! 
PHIPPS She went to see her son. 
GORDY She's lying!   She's The Wolf! 
Gordy runs out.   Phipps and others follow.      OFF Brandt... 
356   INT. BATHROOM                                                     356 
Brandt bursts in. He searches. Finds Mauro's leather doll behind the toilet. The head's detached. Brandt looks inside, and... 
We see a block of reddish Semtex plastic explosive and a chemical fuse. 
BRANDT Everybody out!     Clear this floor! Now! 
357   INT. STAIRWELL                                                    357 
Gordy jumps downstairs, four steps at a time. 
358   INT. CORRIDORS                                                    358 
Institute personnel evacuate offices. 
359   EXT. LATIN AMERICAN INSTITUTE - STREET - VARIOUS ANGLES           359 
Selena and the agents cross the street toward the safe house. 
Claudio GUNS the BIKE toward them. 
Selena hears the BIKE. Sees Claudio coming. Uses the front edge of her hand to strike the female agent hard in the throat. The agent falls to her knees trying to suck air through a crushed windpipe. Selena whip-kicks the other agent to the ground. 
Claudio brakes hard next to Selena, who takes the female agent's pistol and spare magazines as... 
360   GORDY                                                        360 
bursts outside, followed by Phipps et al. 
Claudio OPENS FIRE with a MACHINE PISTOL, hitting two agents and scattering Gordy, Phipps and the rest. Selena SHOOTS the two escort people dead, then BLASTS away at the other people pouring out of the institute as she straddles the Ducati behind Claudio, and the powerful BIKE SCREAMS off down the street. 
Gordy jumps to his feet and runs after them. 
361   EXT. BUILDING'S TOP FLOOR                                    361 
BOOM! A MASSIVE EXPLOSION spits flame out of the windows of the building's top floor. 
362   PEOPLE                                                       362 
dive for cover.   Debris showers the street. 
363   GORDY                                                        363 
keeps moving. 
364   STREET IN FRONT OF INSTITUTE                                 364 
Selena's a soldier, taught to pick up and use whatever weapons she finds as she moves through a battlefield -- this battlefield gives her a crowbar, which she keeps as she runs out through plastic covering the other doorway. 
390    ARCHWAY                                                       390 
leads into the dining room. Selena runs in. Gordy's right on her heels. Selena pulls down dining room chairs in front of Gordy. He vaults one but trips over the second and falls. 
391    SELENA                                                        391 
blows through a swinging door into the kitchen, slamming into a Hispanic maid, who's coming to investigate all the noise. Both women tumble. Selena gets right back on her feet. She breaks out a window with the crowbar and exits onto a fire escape as Gordy blasts in from the dining room. 
392    OMITTED                                                       392 thru                                                                 thru 
395    EXT. TOWN HOUSE - FIRE ESCAPE                                 395 
The window Selena slipped through easily is small for Gordy. He gets hung up on the glass, losing precious seconds. Selena's already halfway up when Gordy hits the fire escape steps. 
The fire escape ends at a top floor window. Selena BREAKS out the GLASS with the crowbar and goes in. 
396    INT. TOWN HOUSE - VARIOUS SHOTS                               396 
Selena's in a teenager's bedroom. The teenager's got headphones on, oblivious to everything. Selena darts through a bathroom into a second bedroom. 
396A   GORDY                                                         396A 
enters the first bedroom behind her. 
397    WOMAN                                                         397 
IN GARDENING CLOTHES and holding a digging tool stands on a stairwell landing, alarmed and confused by the chaos she hears in her house. She had started down the stairs but now has turned back at the sound of the WINDOW BREAKING on the top floor. Calls. 
WOMAN IN GARDENING CLOTHES What's going on? 
398   SELENA                                                         398 
runs into the hallway at the top of the stairs, above the woman. 
WOMAN IN GARDENING CLOTHES Who are you?   What are you doing in here? 
399   SELENA                                                         399 
sees an open rooftop door at the top of a flight of stairs and charges upward without answering. 
400   GORDY'S                                                        400 
in the hallway a second later. Meets the Woman In Gardening Clothes, who's now come up the stairs. She screams. Swipes at him with the digging tool, making three deep scratches in his face. Gordy doesn't stop. 
401   OMITTED                                                        401 
402   EXT. TOWN HOUSE - ROOF/ADJOINING ROOFTOPS                      402 
This is where the woman was gardening, tending a rooftop flower bed. Selena emerges, crushes plants as she runs to the next town house roof. 
Gordy hits the roof behind her. 
403   SELENA                                                         403 
As Selena runs from rooftop to rooftop along the row of town houses, we see her warrior determination and discipline. She's thinking ahead and she never hesitates. Her big problem is she's being pursued by an equally well-trained and determined firefighter. And he's not far back. One tumble, and he'll catch her. Selena strains harder. 
404   SELENA                                                         404 
vaults a gap.   Moments later, Gordy vaults it. 
405   SELENA                                                         405 
finally runs out of roof. She looks down. A fire escape ladder leads down to an interior, ground-level courtyard of a small foreign embassy. Still holding the crowbar, Selena takes the ladder down. 
405A   MOMENTS LATER                                                 405A 
Gordy reaches the ladder. Selena's ahead of him by a floor, hurrying down two rungs at a time. Gordy doesn't fuck with the rungs. Just swings over the edge of the roof, grabs the side-rails lightly with his hands, squeezes the rails with the insides of his boots and lets gravity take over. 
406    EXT. EMBASSY - COURTYARD                                      406 
The fire escape leads down to a second-story balcony running around the inside wall of the courtyard. Twin staircases lead from the balcony to ground level, where, across the slate-paved car court, a wrought-iron gate opens onto the street. 
Gordy hits the balcony a half-second after Selena. He grabs her. Selena swings the crowbar to break his arm. Gordy has to let go. Selena heads for the stairs leading to the ground. 
407    GORDY'S                                                       407 
got one chance to intercept Selena. The balcony's too high for him to jump, but the courtyard's ringed with trees -- they're not close, but they're not far, either. Not for a man craving revenge for the deaths of his wife and son, a man who also slides down fire poles for a living. 
Gordy runs down the balcony. Gains speed. Jumps. Launches off the balcony railing. And hurtles himself at the trunk of a medium-sized tree. He hits the trunk. Hangs on. And slides to the ground. And now... 
408    ANOTHER ANGLE                                                 408 
He's between Selena and the only way out.   And there's no way she's getting past him. 
But that's not what Selena's thinking. She attacks with the crowbar, and Gordy can only retreat in the face of the vicious onslaught. He finds a nearby garbage can. It's full, heavy, but he manages to lift it, spilling garbage as he uses the can to block the blows from the crowbar. The CROWBAR THWOCKS into the can over and over, the sound ECHOING LOUDLY in the small courtyard. 
Selena swings again, and Gordy moves to block the hit. It's a feint. She swings under the can and hits a leg. It hurts like hell, he stumbles, but he stays on his feet, still holding the can. Selena goes for his head. 
(CONTINUED) 
408   CONTINUED:                                                       408 
Gordy raises the can. Thwock! Thwock! The can's all dents. There's garbage everywhere. She feints high and then swings low again, a wicked blow to the knee. Gordy stumbles badly this time. Selena breaks for the gate. Gordy sees her and, with all his might slings the can across the slate pavers, and... 
The can takes Selena's legs out from under her. She falls hard. Gets back to her feet quickly and starts to run, when... 
Gordy hits her like a linebacker. Slams Selena against a brick wall. Gets behind her and slips a mighty arm around her thin neck. Selena squirms hard, kicks backward, going for the balls, kneecaps, insteps, doing whatever she can to hurt Gordy and get free. But she's not in a position to do a lot of damage -- and she'd have to kill him before he'd let go. 
Gordy's got his arm locked in a police chokehold around Selena's neck. Uses his weight to force the smaller woman down onto her knees. Presses her harder, till she's sitting back on her legs. Selena can't drop out of the hold, and her legs are immobilized. All she can do is scratch. But Gordy's oblivious. They're alone in the courtyard. Body to body. Head to head. He's pumped with fury and hatred. He tightens the chokehold. Hisses in her ear -- 
GORDY You killed them. 
SELENA (beat; with contempt) One woman, one boy -- they mean nothing next to the thousands who've been slain. 
Gordy hears it.    It only drives him to a deeper fury. 
GORDY They were my family.

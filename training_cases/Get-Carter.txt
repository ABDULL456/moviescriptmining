A chemical factory, brightly lit, passes by and the outskirts of the city appear. 
INT. TRAIN COMPARTMENT - NIGHT 
The train moves slowly along the platform and stops. Carter collects his coat and briefcase from the rack. 
EXT. NEWCASTLE STATION - NIGHT 
The street is fairly deserted. 
Carter exits with other passengers from the train. He pauses and looks about before crossing to the pub opposite. 
INT. THE LONG BAR - NIGHT 
A couple of youths are playing records on the juke box. An old man sits in the corner reading a newspaper. 
Carter enters through the swing door and a weedy BARMAN comes to serve him. 
CARTER Pint of bitter. 
The barman picks up a glass mug and begins to draw the beer. Carter snaps his fingers at him. 
CARTER In a thin glass. 
The barman sighs petulantly, transfers the beer into a thin glass and puts it on the counter. 
A telephone rings. The second barman answers it. 
BARMAN Is there a Mr Carter in the room? 
CARTER Yes. 
Carter walks to the far end of the bar and picks up the receiver. 
CARTER Hello? (pause) Margaret? (pause) Why the hell aren't you here? (he lights a cigarette.) What time? (pause) Is Doreen at the house? (pause) Who's with him then? (pause) When can I see you? Will you be there tomorrow? (pause) Now listen, Margaret... 
The line goes dead. Carter hangs up. 
INT. FRANK CARTER'S HOUSE - HALL - NIGHT 
A key hanging inside the letter box starts to move upwards and out through the flap. A moment later, the door opens. Carter is standing at the bottom of a flight of stairs in a worker's terraced house. He closes the door and climbs the stairs. 
INT. FRANK CARTER'S HOUSE - LANDING - NIGHT 
Carter moves cautiously. His eyes scan the peeling wallpaper, the mildew on the banisters. A roof leak hits an unseen bucket with depressing regularity. 
INT. FRANK CARTER'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT 
An unmade bed with pyjamas on it, a beaten-up wardrobe, a dressing table and chair are about it. Carter hears a vehicle stopping on the street below. He eases back the ancient net curtain. Two men in a Land Rover are looking up. They see him and quickly drive off. 
Carter looks around the room. On top of the wardrobe there's an old shotgun. He reaches up and brings it down. Memories flood back. He reaches up again and finds a box of cartridges. More memories, jack and Frank grew up here. He leaves the gun on the bed and returns to the landing. 
INT. FRANK CARTER'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Pitch black. 
An overhead light snaps on to the face of a dead man FRANK CARTER. He is lying in a coffin. His eyes are closed, his skin made-up, like porcelain. 
Carter stands over the coffin. He gently touches his brother's crossed hands and folds the shroud over his face. He exits, turning out the light and closing the door. 
Darkness returns. 
INT. 'LAS VEGAS' BOARDING HOUSE - ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT 
The landlady, EDNA GARFOOT, is climbing the stairs. She's well built, sexy, experienced. Carter follows with his baggage. He watches her appreciatively from behind. 
She seems mesmerized by what's going on. 
CARTER All right, are you? 
Doreen doesn 't answer. 
CARTER Been staying with a friend? 
Doreen nods. The undertaker coughs and thrusts another screw into the coffin. 
CARTER Sorry about your father. 
DOREEN (pause) Yeah. 
CARTER Tell me, Doreen, did the police say anything? 
DOREEN (dazed) They said he was drunk. 
INT. HEARSE - DAY 
The young undertaker is still in the hearse listening to the radio. In the driving mirror he sees the Land Rover moving slowly tip the road. It stops by the house. Two men suss the scene and drive off. 
INT. FRANK CARTER'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 
CARTER How's school? 
DOREEN I left last year. 
CARTER Oh, what you doing now? 
DOREEN Working at Woolworths. 
CARTER That must be interesting. 
DOREEN Yes. 
Carter and Doreen look at each other awkwardly. 
CARTER What you going to do? Live with Margaret? 
Doreen looks at him nervously, shakes her head and fumbles in her bag for a cigarette. 
Carter continues, slightly indignant. 
CARTER Well, why won't you come with us to South America? My fiancee won't mind, (pause) Your dad would have wanted it. 
The undertaker puts the final screw in. 
UNDERTAKER (to colleague) Get Hughbert up, will you? (to Carter) We're ready now, sir. 
EXT. FRANK CARTER'S HOUSE - DAY 
The undertakers struggle with the coffin down the narrow staircase into the street. Outside Carter and Doreen wait with two men. EDDIE APPLEYARD, a middle-aged man, is wearing a shabby tweed suit, cap and black tie. KEITH LACEY is a young barman who worked with Frank. 
EDDIE We weren't sure where it was taking place, like. 
CARTER Nice of you to come. 
EDDIE No. Frank was a good bloke. 
KEITH He was that. 
EDDIE One of the best. 
INT. LIMOUSINE - DAY 
MARGARET (nervously) Killed?  I don't know anything about it. 
She moves off rapidly. Carter catches up with her. 
CARTER Really. 
MARGARET I must go. I'm in a hurry. 
CARTER I want to talk to you later. 
MARGARET I can't. 
CARTER Tomorrow morning, then? 
Margaret dithers. 
MARGARET Well, all right then. Twelve o'clock on the Iron Bridge. 
Margaret walks off as calmly as she can, her high heels clicking as she goes. Carter watches her disappear. Doreen watches too. 
INT. CREMATORIUM COMMITTAL CHAMBER - DAY 
Frank's coffin is slid inside the furnace. Flames start to lick it as the steel trap closes. 
INT. THE HALF MOON PUB - DAY 
It's a large room with a horseshoe bar in the centre, a real boozer.  A handful of hard drinkers are already in position. 
Carter, Doreen, Keith and Eddie are sitting alone. Their table is already covered with glasses. Doreen appears to be slightly drunk on Babycham, Eddie on whisky and Keith on beer. Carter is stone-cold sober. 
EDDIE Absent friends. (He raises his glass and drinks, then continues thoughtfully.) You don't think he might have done it on purpose? 
KEITH What? You mean, like, kill himself? 
Eddie and Keith look at each other. 
Doreen watches them. She is getting very upset by the conversation. 
KEITH Naw. Frank? Kill himself? You what? 
Carter stares at Keith, who is getting uncomfortable. 
KEITH I mean, what for? 
CARTER That's what I was wondering. 
KEITH Come off it. Frank was... well... straight. He had no worries I know. Hell, we worked together every day for a year. It would have showed. 
CARTER Why would it? 
KEITH It just would. He was always the same. 
CARTER Since when did he drink whisky? 
KEITH Don't know. 
CARTER Nobody seems to know. 
Doreen is now crying openly. 
EDDIE (finishing off his drink) Bloody good bloke. One of the best. 
DOREEN (blurts out) How would you know? (She suddenly jumps up and empties her glass in Eddie's face.) Or you?  Or you? None of you knew. I knew. He was me dad. 
She runs off out of the door crying. Keith goes to follow. Carter puts his hand out to restrain him. 
Eric swings round, startled. 
ERIC Good God! 
Carter smiles. 
CARTER Is he? 
ERIC Jack Carter. 
CARTER (amused) Eric. Eric Paice. 
ERIC What you doing around here then? 
CARTER Didn't you know this is my home town? 
ERIC No, I didn't know that. 
CARTER Funny, that. 
Carter takes out his cigarettes. Eric takes one. 
ERIC Thanks. So what're you doing? On your holidays? 
CARTER No. I'm visiting relatives. 
ERIC Oh, that's nice. 
CARTER It would be. If they were still living. 
ERIC Meaning what? 
CARTER A bereavement. A death in the family. 
ERIC Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. 
CARTER That's all right, Eric. 
Carter flicks bis lighter and gives Eric a, light. 
ERIC Well, well. Small world, isn't it? 
CARTER Very... (pause) So, who you working for these days Eric? 
ERIC Oh, I'm straight. (indicating uniform) Respectable. 
CARTER (smiling) What are you doing? Advertising Martini? 
ERIC Oh, you've been watching television. 
CARTER Yeah, (pause) Come off it, Eric. Who is it? 
Eric smiles back. 
CARTER Brumby? 
Eric shakes his head. 
CARTER Kinnear? 
Eric shakes his head 
ERIC What's it to you anyway? 
CARTER I've always ad your welfare at heart, Eric. Besides which, I'm nosy. 
ERIC You stupid shit! 
Carter walks past Ray, blowing him a kiss. 
Kinnear watches with some amusement. 
KINNEAR You see what it's like these days, Jack.  You can't get the material. 
Carter looks at Eric. 
CARTER Yes, I can see your problem, Mr Kinnear. 
KINNEAR Sit down, Jack, (pause) I could weep. I really could. Sometimes I think I'll retire. Just piss off to the Bahamas and let somebody else employ them, (to girl) Glenda, get Jack a drink. What is it, Jack? 
CARTER (to Glenda) Scotch, please. 
KINNEAR (to bouncer) Piss off, Ray. 
Ray closes the door behind him. 
Glenda brings Carter his Scotch. He looks at her as she sits beside him. 
KINNEAR Eric told me of your bereavement. 
CARTER Yep. 
KINNEAR Do you know, I never knew he worked in one of my places! 
CARTER No? Funny that. Neither did I. 
KINNEAR If I'd known, I'd have fixed him up with something better. 
CARTER Yeah. 
KINNEAR Nasty way to go. 
CARTER Yes. 
One of the three men sitting around the table with Kinnear gets impatient. PETER, LES AND HARRY are well-heeled, middle- aged, northern businessmen. 
HARRY Are we here to play cards or talk about the old days? 
KINNEAR Harry! Jack, I don't want to be rude, but these men have brought a lot of money with them. Glenda, you don't offer a man like Jack a drink in those piddling little glasses.  Give him the bloody bottle. (He picks up his cards.) Now, where are we? 
Harry keeps a cold, wary eye on him. 
KINNEAR Oh... I think I'll stay as I am. 
HARRY (shaken) You're bluffing, you bastard! 
KINNEAR That's what you pay to find out. Right, Jack? 
CARTER Right. If you can afford it. 
HARRY (to Carter) Thought you were going soon. 
CARTER Soon. When you've lost your money. Won't take long. 
HARRY Clever sod, aren't you? 
CARTER Only comparatively. 
KINNEAR Harry, I don't like to push, but could you let us know how much your hand's worth? 
Harry looks at his cards. Glenda tucks her legs up, making sure that Carter gets an eyeful. 
CARTER Really? 
GLENDA He came to see Mr Kinnear. 
CARTER No. 
Carter, getting bored, looks back at the game. 
HARRY (panicking) What's that? 
KINNEAR That's six hundred pounds, Harry. Two hundred to follow you, and I've raised it four hundred. 
Harry sweats some more. 
HARRY Four hundred? 
KINNEAR That's right. 
HARRY You're not seeing me? 
KINNEAR No. 
Harry smiles nervously. He counts some money out. 
HARRY I'll see you, then. 
KINNEAR Calling my bluff, are you, Harry? 
Harry nods. 
Glenda speaks, but this time Carter keeps his eyes on the table. Kinnear lays out his hand  a hearts flush, queen high. 
GLENDA We went about together. 
CARTER Really? 
GLENDA Yes, while he was here. 
CARTER While he was here. You went about together? 
GLENDA He was here for four days. 
CARTER Was he? 
GLENDA Could you do me a favour? 
CARTER Yeah, I'll do you a favour. 
GLENDA Could you please put my glass on the table? 
Carter smiles and does just that. 
KINNEAR Oh, come on, Harry. I haven't won, have I? Go on, you're pulling my leg. 
Kinnear leans across to pick up Harry's cards. Harry grabs them and puts them in the pack. Kinnear turns to Carter. 
KINNEAR How about that, Jack?  Old Harry thought I was having him on. 
HARRY Shut up. 
Carter gets up from the sofa. 
KINNEAR Not going, Jack? 
CARTER I have to. Things to see to. 
INT. FLETCHER'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Anna unhooks her bra. There's a flash of breasts. 
INT. BOARDING HOUSE - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT 
The scene as before. 
CARTER Now hold them. Gently. 
INT. FLETCHER'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Anna's hands cover her breasts. Her head moves slowly from side to side, eyes closed. 
INT. BOARDING HOUSE - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT 
Scene as before. 
CARTER Slowly. Imagine it's me. 
INT. FLETCHER'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Anna's hand caresses the inside of her leg. Her head rolls from side to side slowly. She's breathing heavily. 
CROSS-CUT between Edna's head rocking backwards and forwards and Anna's head moving from side to side. 
CARTER (V.O.) When we're in South America, we'll make love in the sun. Roll over... and make love again... and again... For me... I fancy you... 
THE SPEED OF THE CUTTING BUILDS. 
INT. FLETCHER'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Suddenly the door opens and Gerald comes in. He sees Anna groaning on the bed. 
GERALD What's the matter? You got gut trouble or something? 
Anna sits up abruptly and puts her hand over the receiver. 
ANNA No, darling. Just doing some exercises, (into telephone) Listen, Janet, Gerald's just got in, so I must ring off. (pause) Yes. Yes. I'll come tomorrow. 
INT. BOARDING HOUSE - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT 
Scene as before. 
CARTER Save it till Sunday. I'll be back then. 
Carter replaces the receiver. He still holds Edna's eyes. She rocks to and fro. The rocker creaks. 
The front door bell breaks the mood. 
CARTER That'll be for me. 
INT. BOARDING HOUSE - HALL - NIGHT 
Carter opens the door. Keith is outside. He's sweating. His tie is somewhere round the back of his neck and his suit is covered with dirt. 
KEITH Thorpey. They were waiting for us in the car park. 
CARTER How many? 
KEITH Four of them. 
Carter pulls Keith inside and turns out the light. 
A Ford Zodiac comes along the road. It stops. Four faces peer into the darkness where they're standing. Nobody gets out. The back window winds down. Thorpe's nervous voice floats out. 
EDNA You don't look it. 
CARTER No. Really, I am. 
EDNA Don't come that bloody flannel with me. If you're a traveller, I'm bloody Twiggy. (She points at Thorpe.) And who's he? 
OLD WOMAN What's going on? Have you no thought for others? 
CARTER We're going inside. 
EDNA Inside? Why should I give house- room to your sort? 
CARTER Up the stairs, Keith. The door on the right. 
OLD WOMAN Everybody knows you, Edna Garfoot. Everybody knew there'd be trouble when you moved in. 
Carter, Keith and Thorpe enter the house. 
EDNA You keep your trap shut, Ma. 
OLD WOMAN I'll send my old man to see you! 
EDNA And wouldn't he love it! 
INT. BOARDING HOUSE - HALL - NIGHT 
Carter, Thorpe and Keith are climbing the stairs. Carter stops to pick up Frank's casket. Edna rushes in and slams the door. 
EDNA Where do you think you're going? 
Carter opens the door to his room. 
CARTER Why don't you go and make us all a nice cup of tea? 
Carter shoves Thorpe into the room.  Keith follows. 
EDNA And what you going to do? 
CARTER Make us a nice cup of tea and I'll tell you. I might even let you watch. 
EDNA I'll call the police. 
CARTER (He knows she fancies him) No, you won't. 
Carter closes the door. 
INT. BOARDING HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Carter carefully places the casket on the chest of drawers. 
CARTER Well now, Thorpey. It seems I've got a secret benefactor. (He moves into the room and opens his briefcase, which is lying on the bed.) It's nice to know that. Isn't it, Keith? (He takes out a bottle of whisky.) There's only one trouble, I don't know who to thank. 
Thorpe looks longingly at the bottle of Scotch. Suddenly Carter punches him hard in the stomach. He grunts and collapses into a chair. 
CARTER Now, I want to know who it is, Thorpey. 
Carter tosses the whisky bottle to Keith and continues wearily. 
CARTER All right. If you like, Thorpey, we'll stop mucking about.  Somebody doesn't want me poking my nose into something and I happen to know what that something is. (pause) Now stand up. 
Thorpe looks at him, terrified. Slowly he stands. Carter grabs him by the testicles and applies preasure. Thorpe screams. 
CARTER Who paid you to see me off? 
THORPE I can't Jack. How can I? 
Out of a side door a young man stumbles towards the lily pond.  There, he promptly throws up. 
Carter watches from behind a tree. 
His attention shifts to the white Bentley turning into the drive. It brakes sharply and the driver jumps out. 
CLIFF BRUMBY has been to a police ball. He is impeccably dressed in tuxedo and white scarf. Now he's hopping mad. 
BRUMBY Jesus wept! 
MRS BRUMBY cowers in the passenger seat. 
MRS BRUMBY Now, Cliff, don't get mad. 
BRUMBY I'll murder the little bitch! 
MRS BRUMBY Cliff ... 
Brumby roars up to the front door, banging it furiously. A young woman in a party dress, expecting to greet a latecomer, is stunned to see who it is. 
SANDRA Daddy! 
BRUMBY That's right, bloody Daddy. 
SANDRA I wasn't expecting you until three o'clock. 
BRUMBY And this is what you call having a few friends back for coffee, is it? 
Brumby pushes past her into the house. 
BRUMBY Running bloody riot over my bloody furniture, drinking my bloody booze... 
The rest is lost as he disappears inside. He then powers out through the side door 
BRUMBY ... spewing over my fucking goldfish. 
He aims a kick at the young man's backside, sending him face-down into the lily pond. 
Mrs Brumby gets out of the car and hovers for a moment. As she approaches the house, people pour out. Brumby appears at the door with a boy pulling up his trousers. 
MRS BRUMBY Cliff ... 
Brumby throws the boy out. 
BRUMBY Shut up, Phyllis. (He walks back into the house.) Sandra! 
Mrs Brumby goes into the house and closes the door. Brumby passes an upstairs window as Sandra locks herself in a bedroom. 
BRUMBY Sandra! Unlock the door, you bitch. 
Carter pauses outside the front door and listens to the row going on upstairs. He opens the door and goes in. 
INT. THE PANTILES - NIGHT 
Carter passes silently through the hall into the large sitting room. Mrs Brumby is sitting in an armchair. 
Brumby is still yelling at his daughter upstairs. 
CARTER Good evening. 
Mrs Brumby jumps.  The front door is open. 
MRS BRUMBY (standing) Who are you? 
CARTER I'm an old friend of Cliff's. I want to see him. 
Brumby swings at him. Carter moves away from the punch, then applies several sharp blows to Brumby's head and neck. Brumby groans and collapses into the armchair, hurt. 
Carter walks into the hall and out of the front door. 
CARTER Good night, Mrs Brumby. 
EXT. 'LAS VEGAS' BOARDING HOUSE - NIGHT 
Carter walks up the deserted street to Edna's place. He finds the front door unlocked. 
INT. BOARDING HOUSE - HALL - NIGHT 
Carter enters cautiously. There is no sound. He closes the door quietly and pauses at the foot of the stairs. Still there is no sound. He waits. A sudden rustle attracts his attention. Quietly, he moves to the sitting-room door. 
INT. BOARDING HOUSE - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT 
Carter switches on the light. Edna is pressed against the far wall, holding a poker. Her dress is torn and her hair dishevelled. When she sees Carter, she sighs with relief. 
EDNA You sod. 
CARTER They came back? 
EDNA (sarcastically) No. 
Carter helps himself to a glass of water from the tap. Edna looks at her torn dress. 
EDNA Look at this. You bastard. 
Carter puts the glass on the table. 
EDNA You don't care a stuff, do you? 
Carter takes out his phial of pills. 
CARTER I'll buy you another. 
Carter swallows a pill. 
EDNA What about the lad? They took him away. 
Carter shrugs his shoulders. 
EDNA What'll they do to him? 
CARTER Don't ask me. 
Edna rubs her wrists. 
EDNA They bloody hurt me. 
CARTER You're lucky. They kill as well. 
EDNA (mocking him) And what about you? Did you kill Brumby? 
Carter shakes his head. 
EDNA Thorpey nearly died laughing. 
CARTER That little shit! 
EDNA What about Keith? 
CARTER What about Keith? 
EDNA What you going to do? 
CARTER No. I'm not tired, (pause) Do you eat breakfast? 
Edna laughs. They start to make love. Gently. Below the undulating bedsprings rests a large chamberpot and, beside it, Carter's shotgun. Beyond is the bedroom door. It opens slowly and the two men enter. Only their legs are visible. 
CON (O.S.) Put us in it, Jack. 
Carter is off the bed, and Edna, in a flash. Edna screams and tries to stop the bedclothes following Carter on to the floor. Peter and Con stand beside the bed smiling. Peter is a queer and dressed fancy in a leather coat, wide- bottomed trousers and a loud silk scarf. His hair is bleached blond. Con is more traditional, more butch. He's in a camelhair overcoat, suit and tie. Both are in their thirties. 
PETER Don't let us interrupt you, Jack. 
CARTER I might have guessed. 
CON Sorry about this. But there you are. Orders are orders. 
CARTER And what orders would they be, Con? 
Carter's hand runs over the carpet. It's going towards the chamber pot instead of the gun. 
CON Gerald phoned us in the middle of the night, said he'd heard you've been making a nuisance of yourself. 
PETER We've got to take you back to London. 
CON He said it'd be doing him a big favour. 
Carter's hand finds the chamber pot and quickly moves on towards the gun. 
CON We know why you're all steamed up, and so do Gerald and Sid. 
PETER But they have to be diplomatic. 
Carter pulls out the gun and jumps up. 
CARTER Right. Now take me back to London. 
CON (smiling) It'd be best if you got dressed first. 
Carter moves around the bed towards them. He's naked. 
CON Put it away, Jack. You know you won't use it. 
PETER The gun he means. 
Both men are laughing. 
CARTER Out. 
Peter and Con back down the stairs. Peter looks up at Carter's cock. 
PETER If Anna could see you now. 
CARTER Out. 
CON Now, Jack. Be reasonable. You know we're going to take you back - sooner or later. 
CARTER Out. 
EXT. BOARDING HOUSE - DAY 
Con is the first to emerge from the front door. 
CON Mind you don't catch cold. 
Peter follows. 
PETER I hope she's got understanding neighbours. 
CARTER You bitch! It was you who told them I was here, wasn't it? 
He smacks her hard across the face. Margaret cries out. The car draws alongside. A steel mesh separates the pedestrian way from the traffic, so the two men can't get to Carter until he reaches the end of the bridge. Con leans out, his usual cheery self. 
CON Peter's very upset about his car. He's going to shit all over you. 
CARTER I'll catch up with you later, Margaret. 
And with that he vaults over the handrail on to a corrugated roof. Con jumps out of the Jaguar. 
PETER (shouts above the revs) Come on, get in. 
Con does and they race off. 
EXT. WASTELAND - DAY 
Carter arrives at the top of some narrow, steep, overgrown steps leading down to the river road, where his car is parked. He leaps down the steps as the Jaguar screeches to a halt at the top. Con leaps out of the Jaguar and gives chase. Peter backs the Jaguar and roars off. 
EXT. RIVER ROAD - DAY 
Carter comes running down the steps with Con not far behind. He arrives at the river road. In the distance, he can see his parked car. 
As he nears the car park, Peter's Jaguar comes down the hill. It's going to cut Carter off from his car. 
A Sunbeam Alpine sports car waits there. Its engine roars into life and it races out of the car park. It reaches him just before the Jaguar and slows down. 
GLENDA Over here, Jack. 
Carter sees that the driver is GLENDA. The hood is down, so he vaults into the car as it accelerates off. 
The Sunbeam swings round, narrowly missing the oncoming Jaguar, and roars away. Peter hasn't a chance. He's facing the wrong way and has little room to manoeuvre. 
Glenda laughs as the car swings wildly around a corner at the top of the hill. 
INT. SUNBEAM - DAY 
Every movement Glenda makes is sexually charged manual gear changes, steering, even braking. Carter can't take his eyes off her. 
GLENDA You didn't know you had a fairy godmother, did you? 
CARTER No. I didn't know that. 
GLENDA A fairy godmother, all of your own. Aren't you lucky? 
CARTER So where are we going, Princess? 
GLENDA To the demon king's castle, of course. 
CARTER Of course. Where else? 
The car screams off the road into a multi-storey carpark. 
INT. MULTI-STOREY CAR PARK - DAY 
Glenda really puts her foot down. The car hurtles around each deserted floor. 
CARTER How'd you know where I'd be? 
GLENDA You were seen parking your car. The demon king waves his wand and I was dispatched to bring you to him. Lucky for you I waited. 
CARTER Very lucky, I should think. You're drunk! 
GLENDA Nasty. 
CARTER He must have been pretty sure I'd come. 
GLENDA Don't worry. He's meeting the architects at the restaurant. 
Carter plays with her hair. 
CARTER Aren't you scared Kinnear will find out? 
GLENDA He won't. He thinks I'm simple. 
Carter kisses her neck. 
CARTER What does he want that bloody great country place for? 
GLENDA (knowingly) Entertaining. 
CARTER What kind of entertaining? 
GLENDA Now you're asking. 
Carter looks at the film projector by the bed and points. 
CARTER Does Brumby get a kick out of that crap? 
GLENDA (giggling) Especially when I play the lead. 
Carter wraps his arms about her. 
CARTER Did Kinnear say anything? After I'd left the other night? 
Glenda sits up sharply. 
GLENDA That's why you waited for me. 
CARTER (kissing her on the neck) Not entirely. No. 
GLENDA You sure about that? 
CARTER Sure I'm sure. 
Glenda pushes him away and gets out of the bed. 
GLENDA You bastard. 
Glenda leaves for the bathroom. Carter, curious, looks at the film projector. It's loaded. He switches it on. A beam of light hits the opposite wall. He settles down to watch the film. The leader flashes by, then a title being chalked on a school blackboard 'The Teacher's Pet'.  A zoom back reveals Glenda, bare-breasted, holding the chalk. This is followed by a long shot of a young girl, dressed in school uniform, waiting at a bus stop. A car approaches and stops. A woman driver offers the girl a lift. The woman is Margaret. The identity of the girl not revealed. 
INT. GLENDA'S BATHROOM - DAY 
Glenda is in the bath. Lots of foam. The hot water is still running.  She's smoking. She leans forward, turning off the tap. 
INT. GLENDA'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Carter is sitting up on the mattress, amused by the soft porn unfolding on the white wall in front of him. 
The schoolgirl accepts the lift and the car drives off. The door to an anonymous apartment opens and Margaret comes in with the girl. Her school hat still hides her identity. Glenda is there to greet them. 
The girl is very awkward. Glenda tries to make her relax, sitting her down and showing her a magazine. 
Glenda brings her into a bedroom. She takes her own top off and goes to do the same with the girl. She takes her hat off. A close-up shows that it is Doreen. 
Carter tenses but never flinches from what's happening in the film.  Margaret comes into the bedroom and feigns shock at what she sees. She slaps Glenda and they start fighting, eventually rolling off the bed. 
The apartment door opens and a man smoking a big cigar comes in. 
Carter sits up. It's Albert Swift. 
Albert opens another door, looking for someone. He leaves. Another door opens and he's in the bedroom. He sees the two women fighting on the floor, but on the bed is his prize Doreen.  Carter watches. 
INT. CAFE - DAY 
A girl with a baby in a pram is having a cup of tea. The door slams open. There's Carter. 
CARTER Where's Albert? 
The girl is numb with fear, unable to answer. Carter grabs her by the throat. 
CARTER Where's Albert? 
The girl is frozen with terror. He lets go as suddenly as he grabbed her. 
CARTER I know where I'll find him. 
EXT. BACK STREET - DAY 
Carter walks fast. There's the sound of a phone being dialled. It's the GIRL in the cafe. 
GIRL (V.O.) Eric, he's come for Albert, (pause) I don't know, (pause) On the ferry, I reckon. 
Carter reaches the front of a betting shop. He walks in. 
INT. BETTING SHOP - DAY 
Carter closes the door. Race results and odds are coming over the Tannoy. He moves into the shop until he reaches ALBERT SWIFT. Albert is making out a betting slip and doesn't see him. 
CARTER Hello, Albert. 
Albert looks like he's going to be sick. 
ALBERT Hello, Jack, (snivelling) I don't know anything, Jack. 
CARTER Yes, you do, Albert. Talk or I'll kill you. 
ALBERT I know. I know. 
Carter sees a door at the back. There's a sign for the toilets. 
CARTER Do you want to go to the toilet, Albert? 
At first Albert doesn't understand. 
CARTER Do you want to go to the toilet, Albert? 
This time it clicks. Albert moves to the door and Carter follows. 
EXT. BETTING SHOP BACKYARD - DAY 
Carter turns to close the door. Albert runs for it. He reaches the high double-gate at the end. It's locked and he tries to climb it. No luck. Carter easily pulls him down. Albert faces him. 
CARTER You can't get away from me, Albert. 
ALBERT I know. 
He feels for his cigarettes but can't find them. 
ALBERT For Christ's sake, give us a fag. 
Carter takes out his cigarettes. Albert takes one. 
ALBERT I didn't know who Doreen was. Thought she was just another bird. 
CARTER Did Eric Pake pull her? 
ALBERT Yes. 
Carter comes in from the back and walks calmly through to the street. A blind man is at the counter placing a bet. 
EXT. JETTY - TYNE FERRY - DAY 
The Sunbeam waits in the car park. Eric, Con and Peter arrive in the Land Rover and park behind it. They go down the gangplank to the floating jetty. A ferry is chugging across the water. 
INT. FERRY - DAY 
Carter sits, watching the other passengers. A mother and two young children take his attention. His look is tinted with regret even remorse. 
EXT. JETTY - DAY 
As the ferry comes alongside, Eric, Con and Peter move up to the rail. The passengers disembark, leaving Carter standing alone.  He's holding Con's handgun. 
Eric, Con and Peter hack slowly away to the steel shelters. Peter, impatient as ever, pulls a sawn-off automatic shooter from under his coat, cocks it and fires. Too late. Carter is already safely behind the ferry's superstructure. Eric shouts. 
ERIC No shooters. Cyril said no shooters, you stupid bastard. 
PETER Get stuffed.  He's reloading. 
CON Gerald wants to see him first. 
PETER Shut up. 
Carter is listening to all this. 
CARTER (shouting) Are you coming in? Or do we piss about all day? 
Eric laughs. 
ERIC You're finished, Jack. You know that, don't you? I've bloody finished you. 
CARTER Not till I'm dead, Eric. 
Eric laughs. 
ERIC Oh, you've still got your sense of humour?  Tell him how I've fixed him, Con. 
CON He's told Gerald about you and Anna. 
ERIC Didn't believe us at first, did he, Con? Then Peter talked to him. 
PETER Didn't even say goodbye. Just asked us to take you back - alive. 
ERIC He's probably talking to her right now. Are you still going to fancy her when Gerald's finished with her face? 
Carter shows no emotion. Or are his eyes just that bit sadder?  Peter lets rip again. Another window is shattered. Carter ducks back, allowing Peter time to board the ferry. 
Carter catches a glimpse of Peter as he climbs up the ferry's superstructure to the roof. By the time he heaves himself into position, Carter is waiting. 
CARTER Stay where you are, Peter. 
Peter is helpless, clinging to the roof, unable to even raise his shooter. 
PETER (screaming) Don't. 
There's a long pause while Carter looks at him, then he cold-bloodedly shoots. Peter is blown away. By the time he hits the deck, he's dead. 
Con and Eric panic. They run up the gangplank, safely out of range. 
ERIC Carter, your car needs a wash. 
Eric signals to the driver in the Land Rover to bump the Sunbeam into the water. Two hits and the task is done. Glenda's screams are lost as the river wraps itself around the sinking car. 
Carter watches impassively. 
Carter enters, surveying the audience. Eventually, his eyes alight on the person he's been looking for Margaret. She's involved with a woman friend and doesn't see him. 
The next game starts up. 
EXT. BINGO HALL - NIGHT 
Crowds of people come pouring out. It's the end of the evening's entertainment. Margaret walks out with her friend. Carter follows them and turns up a side street. 
EXT. STEPS LEADING TO BACK STREET - NIGHT 
The place is deserted. Margaret and her friend descend the steps. The clop of their high heels is the only sound. Carter follows discreetly. At the bottom, Margaret and her friend chat for a moment and part. 
Carter follows Margaret. 
EXT. BACK ALLEY - NIGHT 
The clop of Margaret's shoes is heard in the distance. She appears. Carter is following behind. He slips into another dark alley to get ahead of her. As she reaches her home Carter's arm shoots out from behind a pillar. It's holding Con's handgun. 
CARTER I've come for you, Margaret. 
INT. THE HEIGHTS - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT 
There's a big party going on. The music is loud. It's mainly rich-looking middle-aged men and young dolly birds. Different things are obviously going on in different rooms in the house. Dancing in one room, blue movies in another, etc. Kinnear flits from one to another. Eric Paice is on the phone. He puts the receiver down and crosses to Kinnear. 
ERIC Gerald Fletcher wants a word with you Cyril. 
Kinnear crosses to the telephone. 
KINNEAR Hello, Gerald. 
EXT. VILLAGE TELEPHONE KIOSK - NIGHT 
Carter stands in the dimly lit kiosk with Margaret. The hire car is parked alongside. 
CARTER It's Carter. Listen carefully, you hairy-faced git. I've got the film and enough evidence to put you away for a long time. All it takes is one call to the police. 
INT. THE HEIGHTS - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT 
Kinnear listens. 
KINNEAR Really? (pause) So? 
EXT. VILLAGE TELEPHONE KIOSK - NIGHT 
Carter into phone. 
CARTER I'll do a simple deal with you. All I want is ... 
INT. THE HEIGHTS - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT 
Kinnear is still listening to Carter. He looks over at Eric, who's fixing a drink. 
KINNEAR I see. I think that can be arranged. 
Kinnear continues listening. 
INT. VILLAGE TELEPHONE KIOSK - NIGHT 
Carter into phone. 
CARTER ... but I don't want him there until six in the morning.  OK? (pause) Right. 
Carter hangs up. He pushes Margaret towards the car. 
INT. THE HEIGHTS - LIBRARY - NIGHT 
INT. THE HEIGHTS - DAWN 
The police move through the house and grounds. In the bedrooms they find groups of people in bed together. The men in particular protest and are obviously concerned about being identified. The police find evidence of drugs, pornography and so on. 
Outside, police are combing the grounds. In the long grass leading down to the lake they find women's clothes. They follow the trail until they discover a woman floating naked, face downwards, in the lake. A policeman with waders goes in and pulls her to the side. As others heave her out, we see that it's Margaret. 
EXT. THE HEIGHTS - DAWN 
The house is surrounded by police measuring and photographing, and outside the house are police cars and ambulances.  The lawn is crowded with the party crowd. In the early-morning light, they look like dolls. 
Kinnear comes out of the front door with two plain-clothes officers and gets in a police car. Sirens going, it comes down the short drive to the gate. 
INT. HIRE CAR - DAWN 
Carter is driving along a coast road. The sea and a wide beach lie on his right. Long rows of houses are to his left. 
The sun is still low. It's very quiet. He arrives at a harbour and drives on until he reaches the end of a vast wooden jetty running out into the estuary. It's a coal loader for tankers. 
This jetty is very high, a complex of wooden staves and pillars, interwoven with steps and gangways. On its top tier is a complex of railway lines, signals and black coal chutes. 
EXT. COAL JETTY - DAWN 
Carter parks his car and picks up the shotgun and a bottle of Scotch off the back seat. He get out and walks over to the jetty and along a lower gangway. At the far end, a man is standing. It's Eric Paice. Eric turns around abruptly. He sees Carter and disappears up the nearest stairway. Carter follows. 
At the top he stops to listen, but can see and hear only the harbour waters lapping below. 
Carter looks back to the coal jetty, just in time to see Eric scamper down to the level below. Eric sprints for the roadway. Carter waits and then starts running directly above him. 
Eric keeps running. Carter stays always overhead. He's playing cat and mouse with Eric. 
CARTER (calling out) You couldn't win an egg and spoon race, Eric. 
ERIC (wheezing) Sod off. 
Paice darts down another staircase to ground level and makes for the roadway. Carter stops above the roadway. Below, Paice makes for the parked car. Carter holds the gun up. Eric stops and looks up. 
CARTER Stay away from the car or I'll blow you apart. 
Eric darts under the jetty. Carter runs on down the steps. He can see Eric scampering along the row of cottages towards the beach. Carter starts after him. 
EXT. BEACH - EARLY DAY 
Eric runs out on to the beach. The only sounds are his feet pounding the pebbles and his hurtful panting. 
In the distance, factory chimneys belch out smoke.  Carter appears. For a moment he watches Eric stumbling along at the far end of the beach. He climbs down to the beach and starts running. 
EXT. BEACH - EARLY DAY 
Carter is gaining on Eric rapidly. Eric looks round and panics. He stumbles and falls over. 
He gets to his feet quickly and disappears round the headland. Carter follows. 
EXT. BEACH - EARLY DAY 
On the other side of the headland, the scene is extraordinary. The deserted beach is like the edge of the world. The sand is black as far as the eye can see. It's littered with rubbish. Several old lorries are sunk deep in the sand. High, grass-covered cliffs flank it on the left. It's deserted. 
In the distance, a continuous line of giant black buckets move, like cable-cars, out to sea, before they deposit their load of coal slag and move inland again. The coal mine itself is inland, hidden away behind the cliffs. The sea, like the sand, is black as it crashes on to the shore. 
Eric is half-way along the beach, struggling in the mud. Carter closes on him. 
EXT. BEACH - EARLY DAY 
Eric nears the line of buckets and cuts inland towards the mine.  Carter has nearly caught up. The buckets grind and crash as they move along the cable. 
Eric scrambles up the narrow valley down which the coal slag travels. He is panting horribly. Carter is close on his heels.  Near the top, where the buckets are practically at ground level, Eric stumbles and falls. He is too exhausted to get up.

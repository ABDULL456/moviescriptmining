Final Shooting Script 
BLACK SCREEN 
RAV ZINGESSER "And God said to Abraham, 'Take your son, your only son, whom you love, Isaac, and go into the land of Moriah and offer him there for a sacrifice upon a mountain that I will show you..." 
INT. YESHIVA CLASSROOM -- DAY 
A run-down place. A dozen 12-year-old BOYS sit at old- fashioned desks. These are not Hasidim, but Orthodox Jews: normal American kids in yarmulkes. The teacher, RAV ZINGESSER is young, overweight, acnescarred, good-humored. 
RAV ZINGESSER And why did the Holy One -- blessed be He -- do this? Why did he ask Abraham to sacrifice his only son, whom he loved? 
Two boys off to one side: AVI (a smart, tough, brownnose) and DANNY (the eternal dissident) argue under their breath.... 
12-YEAR-OLD DANNY Isaac wasn't his only son. Ishmael was his son, too. 
12-YEAR-OLD AVI The only son he loved. 
12-YEAR-OLD DANNY Oh, they only kill them when they love them...? 
12-YEAR-OLD STUART (up front; answering Zingesser) It was a test of Abraham's faith. Of his devotion to God. 
12-YEAR-OLD DANNY It's not about Abraham's faith. It's about God's power. God says, "You know how powerful I am? I can make you do anything I want, no matter how stupid. Even kill your own son. Because I'm everything, you're nothing." 
TITTERS. Danny looks around at his classmates: nerds, wankers, nose-pickers. Two kids in back furtively read the racing form under their desks. He hates them for their indifference as much as he despises Stuart's piety or Avi's ass-kissing. 
RAV ZINGESSER But, Danny, if HaShem is everything, and we are nothing how are we to judge His actions? 
12-YEAR-OLD DANNY We have free will and intelligence -- which God allegedly gave us.... 
AVI Anyway, God never lets Abraham kill Isaac. He provides the ram so that -- 
12-YEAR-OLD DANNY Personally, I think that's a lie. I think he did kill him. 
RAV ZINGESSER You think?! Based on what? 
12-YEAR-OLD DANNY There's midrash supporting this. My father read a book by Shalom Spiegel that -- Isaac actually died and was reborn. 
RAV ZINGESSER No one follows that midrash. 
12-YEAR-OLD DANNY I do; I follow it. But okay, say God provided the ram. So what? Once Abraham raised the knife, in his heart it was as if he'd killed him. He could never forget that. And neither could Isaac. Look at him: he's traumatized, he's a putz for the rest of his life. By the end he can't tell Jacob from Esau.... 
The kids laugh. Zingesser CRACKS a ruler against a desk. 
RAV ZINGESSER Watch your language.... 
12-YEAR-OLD DANNY (rising impassioned) I think the whole Jewish people were permanently scarred by what happened on Mt. Moriah, and we still live in terror.... 
12-YEAR-OLD STUART Fear of God is the beginning of wisdom. 
12-YEAR-OLD DANNY Fear of God makes you afraid of everything. All the Jews are good at is being afraid. And being sacrificed. 
Oooo. CRACK, CRACK, CRACK. Even the guys with the sports pages are shocked by that one. 
12-YEAR-OLD STUART Don't you believe in God? 
12-YEAR-OLD DANNY I'm the only one here who does believe. You say he's mysterious, yet merciful. I see him for the power- drunk madman He is. And we're supposed to worship such a Deity?? I say Never! I say...fight him. I say -- 
The ruler has been CRACKING from "power-drunk" on.... Now Zingesser grabs Danny, yanks him out of his chair. 
RAV ZINGESSER Avi -- ask Rabbi Springer to come remove Danny from the class.... 
Avi rises, grinning, as...Danny struggles wildly to get free. 
RAV ZINGESSER And you, if you had come out of Egypt, you would have been destroyed in the desert with those who worshipped the Golden Calf. 
12-YEAR-OLD DANNY Then let Him destroy me now. Let Him crush me like the conceited bully He is. (to the ceiling) Go ahead. Kill me. Here I am. Do it!! 
The class sits frozen in terror, waiting for God to kill Danny. But nothing happens. 
INT. YESHIVA STAIRWELL -- NIGHT 
He HIGHLIGHTS the item about Curtis Zampf... 
EXT. VOMPADINK -- TWILIGHT 
A tough working-class Queens bar. 
INT. VOMPADINK -- TWILIGHT 
Men drink in clusters, including a group of skinheads.... Danny takes a place alone at the bar, drawing furtive attention from the regulars. When the BARTENDER finally comes over... 
DANNY Vodka tonic. 
A strange call for this place. As he waits, Danny turns and watches the skinheads enough to make them aware of him. 
The girls watch him, too. The skins don't like that. One of them (Billings) seems ready to do something about it. The others try to calm him, and when they look back, Danny has left. He barely touched the drink. 
The skins are puzzled, but one indicates his watch: time to go. They gather their stuff.... 
EXT. CITY/INT. 7 TRAIN -- EVENING 
Looking out the front of the train as it rushes toward Manhattan. A dramatic sky rises above the skyline. 
EXT. STREET -- NIGHT 
The three skins -- O.L., CARLETON, BILLINGS -- walk up an East Side street. Billings is telling a story.... 
BILLINGS ...So she takes the pants in back -- where they try them on? And I think fuck it.... 
CARLETON Are you shitting me?? Right in the store? 
BILLINGS She's been giving me the eye. She's hot. So I wait till the owner goes up front.... 
During this, O.L. starts to SPRAY PAINT a crude SWASTIKA onto a BUS KIOSK. A VOICE startles them.... 
VOICE What are you doing?? 
They jump, turn. Danny steps out of the shadows. 
DANNY (indicating swastika) What do you think you're doing? 
BILLINGS Who the fuck are you? 
DANNY (coming toward them) Who am I?? Who are you, you schmucks, you can't even make a decent swastika.... Give me the paint. (O.L. looks to his friends) Give it to me. 
Danny's will is stronger; O.L. hands over the spray can. Danny shakes it, critiques O.L.'s rendering.... 
DANNY (gruff but avuncular) It's too squared off. You got to orient it up and down, diamond-shaped, like this.... (sprays an excellent swastika) ...The arms go clockwise. (hands the can back) You're going to Curtis Zampf; me, too. Let's go? 
They exchange looks: how did he know about Curtis? 
CURTIS ZAMPF (O.S.) ...Where I grew up in South Boston twenty years ago, when a kid walked down the street, everyone knew who he was... 
INT. LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT 
Grand but threadbare. The skins enter: O.L. like a child, Carleton like a sardonic adolescent, Billings like a revolutionary, Danny like an uncrowned prince. 
CURTIS ZAMPF is addressing a dozen or so guests. He is 40 but appears younger; with rough good looks, longish hair and a leather jacket, he seems more like an aging rock star or sexy novelist that a standard-issue American Nazi. 
CURTIS ...If he ran out in front of a car, some old Mick'd yell at him, "Jimmy Dunne, get back on that sidewalk and stay there...." 
He does the Boston Irish accent so well, everybody laughs. Up front we notice the only WOMAN in the room. She is in her 40s, regal, beautiful, forbidding. Her name is LINA MOEBIUS. 
CURTIS ...The day he graduated high school, he'd go see his uncle down at the gas works, or the priest's brother in the shipyard, get his apprentice papers, eight years later he'd be making $16.50 an hour, have four kids, play ball on Sundays in Columbus Park, and when he died, the whole town'd get drunk and cry over him.... 
The crowd -- nonunion electricians, white taxi drivers, unemployed bookkeepers, failed academics, off-duty cops -- listens quietly. 
During this, a young woman (CARLA) appears from the rear of the apartment, heading for the kitchen with a coffee cup and a history book. She glances into the living room. 
CURTIS ...Today, when that kid walks down the street it's full of trash and half the faces are black. The shipyard's closed, all the jobs at the gas works are set-asides, and by the time he drops out of school, he can barely get a job at Burger King. So he drinks, smokes crack, and when he hangs himself on the front porch at twenty-three, the only people at his wake are a couple of buddies and his mother. The boy's father won't find out he's dead till six months later. (beat) The soul of this country is being destroyed, and all the government can offer is free trade, mutual funds and IPOs. 
GUY DANIELSEN You sound like a leftist. 
CURTIS I used to be one.... No, seriously, I called myself an anarchist. I stood up for the oppressed. I opposed state power. 
AN OLD COOT Don't you still? 
CURTIS I oppose the present state because it's weak. It has been ever since the left emasculated it over Vietnam. But I think the average man is crushed less by accumulated capital than the loss of community or real leadership, the personal emptiness he simply cannot fill on his own.... (matter-of-fact) That's why I'm a fascist. It's the only form of government that addresses our deepest needs. 
DANNY ...Leona Helmsley, Michael Eisner, Bob Dylan, Phillip Roth, Ruth Bader Ginsberg, Steven Spielberg, Winona Ryder, Beverly Sills, Alvin Toffler, Katherine Graham. All of them. But not yet. We don't want celebrity obscuring the issue. 
CARLA Which is what? 
DANNY At first, no one will know why the victims are being killed. 
CURTIS You wouldn't announce it? 
DANNY I'd say nothing. After two or three, people will try to find a pattern. A reason. 
CURTIS But when it comes out, the public will be outraged. It will look like Germany all over again. 
DANNY Isn't that what we want? Germany all over again? Only done right this time... 
The crowd feels a deep atavistic thrill. Zampf glances at Mrs. Moebius.... 
DANNY Without speeches or political parties. A movement without leaders so that no one can stop it... 
The room is stunned to silence. Mrs. Moebius signals Curtis. 
CURTIS Okay, let's break this up for now.... (to Danny) Could you wait a minute...? 
INT. SAME -- FIVE MINUTES LATER 
Danny -- flushed with triumph -- stands looking down at the city. 
ACROSS THE ROOM -- MRS. MOEBIUS & CURTIS ZAMPF 
CURTIS (low) ...I thought we agreed, no anti- Semitism...it's exactly what we're trying to put behind us.... Trash the blacks, fine; but... 
MRS. MOEBIUS Did you see how they reacted to him? 
CURTIS Yes, of course. But that only plays in this room, with people who aren't embarrassed to call themselves Nazis. If you want a modern fascism, you don't mention Jews. 
MRS. MOEBIUS It's a romantic movement, Curtis. It always has been. 
CURTIS Lina, the Thousand-Year Reich barely lasted a decade.... Do you really want to go down that road again? In America of all places, where obedience and discipline are not exactly the national virtues... 
She looks over at Danny, now chatting with Carla.... 
LINA He's very bright. 
CURTIS He speaks well. But what do we do with him? 
LINA Let's find out who he is. 
CURTIS You mean who he really is. 
ON DANNY & CARLA 
CARLA You're not in school? What do you do? 
DANNY I work at the Big Boy warehouse. In Queens. I drive a fork-lift. 
CARLA Where'd you read all that stuff? 
DANNY I just read it.... 
LINA Young man... 
He turns. She's beckoning to him. He gives Carla a look, then crosses to her, sitting in a chair she indicates. Curtis offers him a drink; he declines. Carla takes one. 
LINA Lina Moebius. And you are...? 
DANNY Daniel Balint. 
LINA Balint? 
DANNY It's German. 
LINA (IN GERMAN) What part of Germany are you people from? 
DANNY (IN GERMAN) From the Rhineland originally. 
LINA (IN ENGLISH) Are you with the FBI, Mr. Balint?... Or any other law enforcement agency? 
DANNY I was going to ask you the same thing. 
LINDA The Polacks? From Sacred Heart? 
DANNY Nobody ever beat me up. (as she sighs, turns to go) Look, Linda, there're fifty reasons. Even if you knew them all, there'd be another fifty you didn't know. 
LINDA Do you know them? (off him) I made him some noodles for dinner. You can heat them up and -- 
DANNY I've got to get back to the -- 
LINDA You can heat them up and eat with him. 
INT. LIVING ROOM, QUEENS HOUSE -- NIGHT 
Danny (now wearing a plain white T-shirt) bends over the coffee table eating a noodle casserole and reading the Post. His father eats off a TV table. He finishes, cursorily wipes his mouth, picks up a remote and turns on the television. 
DANNY It's Friday.... 
FATHER (a hoarse rasp) Do I give a shit? 
Danny holds up both hands: he's not arguing, simply informing. 
FATHER The Torah says not to light a fire on the Sabbath, because it's work, correct? (Danny sighs) But if alternating current's running through the wires every second of every day, and I throw a switch, send it here instead of there, how is that lighting a fire? 
DANNY "Do chickens give milk?" 
FATHER Exactly. 
He channel-surfs until he comes to a stand-up COMIC doing a routine. They both watch. 
TV: the COMIC is funny in a brutal, compulsive way. Lots of pop references, implicit postmodern nihilism. The routine reflects what Danny (and the Shiites, the Unabomber, Timothy McVeigh, T.S. Eliot, et al.) have against the modern world. 
FATHER Who's this? 
DANNY Dennis Leary. 
FATHER Leary? 
DANNY No. 
The father grunts with grim satisfaction, he suspected as much. 
DANNY (offering consolation) Howard Stern. 
FATHER Obviously. 
Danny sighs: why bother. But adds... 
DANNY Adam Sandler. 
FATHER Funny? 
DANNY Not like Mr. Dorfmann. 
FATHER He was funny. 
As they watch, apropos of nothing: 
FATHER After your mother died, that's when you stopped going to shul. Doing your homework. Everything. 
DANNY And that's when the Mets started to stink. 
FATHER 'Cause they got rid of Johnson. He knew how to deal with the assholes. Dallas Green, please... 
DANNY Valentine... 
The father snorts. On TV the comic gets off a line, and they both laugh. Their laughs are quite similar; they glance at each other. 
FATHER There's some maple walnut in the freezer. 
DANNY Linda says you're not supposed to have dairy. 
FATHER Just a little... What's the difference? 
Danny goes into the kitchen. The father extracts a pack of Salems from between the cushions, lights one, takes a desperate drag... The phone RINGS. He curses, stubs it out, grabs the phone. 
FATHER Yeah?... Hold on.... It's for you. 
Danny gives his father a dish of ice cream, takes the phone. 
GUY (laughing, embarrassed) What's that go to do with...I've gone out with a, with Jewish women. Why? 
DANNY And? WHat did you notice? 
GUY Notice? Like what...? 
DANNY Jewish girls like to give head, right? 
GUY I don't know. Is that right? 
DANNY And Jewish men like to get it. 
GUY Everybody likes to, don't they? 
DANNY Yes. It's very pleasurable. But the Jews are obsessed with it. You know why? 
GUY Why? 
DANNY Because the Jew is essentially female. 
GUY Female... 
DANNY Real men -- white, Christian men -- we fuck a woman. We make her come with our cocks. But the Jew doesn't like to penetrate and thrust -- he can't assert himself that directly -- so he resorts to perversions. Oral sex is technically a perversion, you know that, don't you? (as Guy nods) After a woman has been with a Jewish man, she never wants a normal partner again. A normal man. 
GUY Does that mean the Jew is the better lover? 
DANNY You're not listening. He isn't better. He gives pleasure, but that's actually a weakness. 
GUY Danny, what makes you think you know all this? 
DANNY Let's just say I've done due diligence. 
GUY So, fine, it's not that the Jew, the Jews own the media and the banks. It's that they're sexually corrupt. 
DANNY The Jews clearly control the media and the banks. Investment banks, not the commercial ones. But the point is they carry out in those realms the same principles they display in sexuality. They undermine traditional life; they deracinate society. 
Danny leans over to make sure Guy's getting it right. 
DANNY Deracinate... Tear out the roots. A people -- a real people -- derives its genius from the land: the sun, the sea, the soil. This is how they know themselves. But the Jew doesn't have soil. 
GUY He has Israel. 
DANNY Those aren't Jews. 
GUY Of course they're Jews. 
DANNY Notice the Israelis: a fundamentally secular society. They no longer need Judaism because they have soil. The real Jew is a wanderer, a nomad. He has no roots, no attachments. So he "universalizes" everything. He can't hammer a nail, plow a field. He can only buy and sell, invest capital, manipulate markets. He takes the life of a people rooted in soil and turns it into a cosmopolitan culture based on books, ideas, numbers. This is his strength.... (pumped; this is what he loves) Take the great Jewish minds: Marx, Freud, Einstein. What have they given us: communism, infantile sexuality and the atom bomb. In a mere three centuries since these guys emerged from the ghettos of Europe, they've taken us from a world built on order and reason and hurled us into a chaos of class warfare, irrational urges and relativity, a world where the very existence of matter and meaning is in doubt. Why? Because it is the deepest impulse of the Jewish soul to unravel the very fabric of life until nothing is left but thread, nothing but nothingness. Nothingness without end... 
GUY Are all Jews the same? 
DANNY Differences exist, of course, but they're irrelevant. For the Jew, his Jewishness dominates everything. Even the ones who renounce it, who hate it, who want to cut it out of their hearts a knife...can't escape. They're still just Jews. 
Guy finishes writing that and looks up. 
GUY Danny, this is great. You're incredibly articulate. One more thing... How can you believe this when you're a Jew yourself? 
A beat. Danny smiles at the mistake.... 
DANNY What? Excuse me?... (Guy says nothing) You're kidding, right? 
GUY Do you know Rabbi Stanley Nadelman? He used to be at Congregation Beth Elohim in Ozone Park...? 
DANNY Who? How would I know him? 
GUY He says you were bar mitzvahed there, in March 1988. 
DANNY You believe that? And you call yourself a reporter? 
GUY So you're saying it's not true. 
DANNY Look at me.  DO I look Jewish?  Look... 
He indicates his hair, turns sideways to show his profile? 
GUY Were you ever bar mitzvahed anywhere else? 
DANNY Do you know who you're fucking with here? 
He stumbles backward. The others crowd around, keep him from falling, also from getting away. Billings starts to help, but people grab him: this is Danny's problem. 
Steroid comes at him.... Danny steps inside the charge and goes to work on the bigger man's body. We barely see what happens, but we hear it and feel the crowd's shock. Danny is stronger than we realized and much more vicious. In seconds, Steroid sinks to his knees, face bloody. Danny holds up him, leans close: 
DANNY Enough? 
Steroid mumbles in the affirmative. Danny nods -- then hits him four more shots to the face. Even this crowd winces. Steroid drops with a wet thud. 
As Danny straightens up, wiping the blood off his hands, people instinctively step back. 
DANNY Which was his room? 
KYLE (ferrety, glasses) Number ten. 
On the end: has an extra window. Danny walks into the room. Steroid's stuff starts flying out the door. 
EXT. MOTEL PORCH -- NIGHT 
Danny on a pay phone. 
DANNY Yeah, I'm trying to reach Carla, is she?... Did she get my other message?... No, I'll call back.... 
EXT. MOTEL PORCH -- NIGHT 
Danny hangs up the phone, glances into a room where we dimly glimpse Nazis taking drugs, drinking beer, screaming... 
VARIOUS VOICES Fucking niggers... Fucking niggers? Fucking gooks!... 
Then incomprehensible shrieking rage, a fight, breaking glass... 
Danny sighs, bored. He spots two nerdy Nazis, KYLE and WHIT, playing some battle re-creation board game and rehashing WWII.... 
WHIT ...Look, if Hitler had knocked out the RAF in '39, which he could easily, easily have done, he'd have taken England, and the U.S. wouldn't have had -- 
KYLE ...A staging ground for the invasion, yeah. But he blew it going after civilian targets. Just like he blew the Russian front, diverting supplies to Auschwitz.... 
Danny looks up the hill toward a farmhouse perched above them. One light burns inside. 
DANNY Where's Mrs. Moebius? 
KYLE Her place is down the road. But she just comes out for weekends sometimes. 
Danny squats to look at the board game. 
DANNY What is this, Stalingrad? 
WHIT Gettysburg. But we're refighting it with World War I technology. It's a fucking bloodbath. 
He grins maniacally. Danny smiles. Kyle is emboldened by Danny's unexpected friendliness, lowers his voice.... 
KYLE That was unbelievable what you did to Lucas. The guy's an animal. 
DANNY You could do it. 
KYLE Get out of here.... 
DANNY You look right through him. He's there, but there's something on the other side of him that you want. It's all you want. And whatever's in the way doesn't matter.... Then it's easy. 
As Kyle and Whit contemplate his wisdom... 
DANNY Either of you know anything about explosives? 
They both look up, very interested. 
TWO FAMILIES IN TABLEAU -- WOODEN CUTOUTS -- DAY 
Jews: MAN (black hat, beard), WOMAN (sheitl, shawl), BOY (kippah, twerpy), GIRL (fat, ugly), even a DOG, a Star of David on its side. 
Blacks: MAN (watermelon, pitchfork), WOMAN (fat, fried chicken), BOY (syringe, 9mm), GIRL (twins, welfare check), DOG (black). 
VOICE (O.S.) Take a breath, let out a little, relax, then squeeze. (a RIFLE SHOT; nothing's hit) Again... 
Another SHOT. A bullet hits the Jewish boy in the rear end. Sunlight streams through the hole. We are: 
EXT. REAR OF MOTEL -- DAY 
Danny peers down the barrel of an M-16. Kyle squats beside him. 
DANNY (disgusted with this idiocy) Oh, please... 
BILLINGS Danny, it's true. There were no six million. At most, two hundred thousand Jews died in the camps. And the majority of them were from disease and -- 
The Jews are shouting about historical records, the disappearance of families, whole towns.... But Danny is louder: 
DANNY Where did you read this? Robert Faurisson? 
BILLINGS (surprised he knew) Yeah. He's a respected scholar. Even No-am Chomsky says he -- 
DANNY Billings, if Hitler didn't kill six million, why is he your hero?... Concentration camps all over Europe, and he only gets rid of a measly two hundred thousand.... He's a putz. 
Some surprise that a Nazi is arguing against a denier. 
ANCIENT JEW Hitler was not a putz. Hitler was real. God created him to punish the Jews for abandoning God. 
The other survivors are embarrassed by this, but the Ancient Jew ignores them. 
ANCIENT JEW It is you who are putzes. Little pishas with your dreams of hatred and killing... 
Danny scoffs, gets up to leave. 
HATE COUNSELOR Where do you think you're going? 
DANNY ...We have nothing to learn from these people. They should learn from us. 
As Danny walks out, the Ancient Jew catches his eye. 
ANCIENT And what should we learn from you, Daniel? 
Her use of Danny's name feels knowing, slyly invasive. All SOUND VANISHES for a beat, and Danny barely manages to say: 
DANNY Kill your enemy. 
EXT. MOTEL -- DAY 
Kyle opens the trunk of his car, shows Danny inside: two bags of shotgun powder and several lengths of metal piping with screw-on caps. 
DANNY What is it? 
KYLE Green dot -- shotgun powder. For pipe bombs. (off Danny's reaction, smiles) A guy in a lumberyard gave it to me. A donation to the cause. 
CARLETON (O.S.) Hey, Danny.... Guess who's here.... (as Danny quickly slams the trunk) Your girlfriend... She's up at the house. 
EXT. THE FARMHOUSE -- DAY 
In the driveway: Carla's Mercedes, a Triumph motorcycle. Danny peers in through the windows, goes to the door. 
INT. FARMHOUSE, LIVING ROOM -- DAY 
Danny sees Carla sitting on a green sofa wearing a white sundress and leafing through a magazine. Curtis is mixing drinks. Lina is practicing with her stylus on a new electronic organizer. 
LINA My L's keep coming out as C's.... 
CURTIS (spots Danny) The prisoner returns.... 
Danny greets them all. Carla barely looks up. 
LINA Danny, get a drink and come talk to me. 
INT. LIVING ROOM -- A FEW MINUTES LATER 
Danny talking with Lina and Curtis but watching Carla. 
CURTIS ...Insulting people who were in the camps. ...What's the point? 
DANNY They're liars and cowards. 
CURTIS I'm sure they are. But what do we accomplish by pointing it out? 
DANNY It's the truth.... 
Curtis rolls his eyes. Lina signals him to lay off. 
LINA MOEBIUS Danny, what do you think of our troops? 
DANNY (trying to be diplomatic) They have guts. And they know what they hate...which is good. But they have no idea why; they don't think, they don't read.... They're on beer and crank half the time.... 
Straightening up, Danny is stunned by a vision: 
THE OPEN ARK -- THE TORAHS 
...their silver crowns and breastplates, velvet robes. And Steroid Excess, lifting one out. Danny reacts with an instinctive horror. 
DANNY What are you doing? Put that down! ...Put it back in there. 
Steroid -- cowed by Danny -- starts to obey, but before he can... 
BILLINGS What do you care? 
DANNY I don't, but... 
BILLINGS (vaults onto the stage) Let's look at the fucking thing. 
Each CURSE makes Danny wince, but he just hovers about nervously as Billings and Steroid try to unwrap the Torah while others gather, some comically wrapping themselves in tallises. 
DANNY Put it there, on the... 
He indicates the bema, stepping back as if to deny any involvement, yet at the same time trying to monitor everything they do. 
DANNY (indicating crowns, the yod...) Just be careful with the... 
O.L. (puts a crown on his head) "If I were king of the forest...not Prince, not Duke, not Earl..." 
Danny cannot endure this desecration, but everyone else laughs, so he keeps his mouth shut. 
KYLE Open it up. 
DANNY (impulsively taking over) Here... 
He shoves his way in and, gripping the handles, unrolls the Torah. Low MURMURS at the sight of the broad columns, the mysterious calligraphy, the CRACKLING parchment. Danny himself is struck by the sudden immediacy of the sacred text. OVER this... 
VOICES Oooo... Weird... You read it from right to left.... The letters look like squashed bugs.... What kind of paper is that? 
DANNY It's not paper, it's parchment. It's made from sheepskin. And all the letters are drawn by hand. 
KYLE Neat calligraphy. 
Danny nods, then, as if against his will.... 
DANNY It's called the flame alphabet. It's supposed to be the word of God written in fire. 
BILLINGS Fire... 
DANNY The mystics tried to read the white spaces around the letters. They thought there was a whole alternative language hidden there, with secret, alternative meanings. 
KYLE Cool. 
Danny sees Drake watching him, smirks to express his disgust. 
BILLINGS How come you know all this shit? 
DANNY How come you don't know it? (pressing the advantage) How can you say you hate the Jews when you don't know anything about -- 
BILLINGS Fuck you. I hate the Jews at least as much as you do. 
DANNY No, you don't.... If you hated them, you'd study them, so you'd know why you hate them. You know what tefillin is? Tsitsis? Shotness? You know the kaddish from the kiddush? (obviously not) Eichmann? He went to Israel. He studied the Torah, the Talmud, the Mishnah, the whole bit. He hated Jews. 
CARLETON Who's Eichmann? 
DANNY Who's Eichmann?!!? 
Danny's incredulous, though it's not clear how many of the others know why Eichmann was. 
KYLE He was head of the Gestapo's Jewish sector. He deported people to the camps. 
CARLETON (reaching toward the parchment) Can we touch it? 
DANNY Yeah, but not on the letters. 
BILLINGS Why the fuck not? 
DANNY (warning finger) Just don't. 
Billings bristles at Danny's authority; Carleton says to him... 
RABBI (ON TV) The purest form of spirit... 
ON DANNY. Sound fades. He's haunted: "Nothingness without end" was what he'd told Guy Danielsen the Jews were obsessed with. He seems to hear the cello playing "Kol Nidre" again. Then... 
DANNY Okay, everybody out. Get out. 
He switches off the TV. Shoves them out the door, slams it. 
INT. DANNY'S MOTEL ROOM -- LATER 
Alone he sits at the desk, finds himself gazing at the Torah, standing in a corner of his closet, draped in the tallis. 
He slams the closet door, it bounces open. Slams it again, making sure it latches. 
He sits down, looks at the closed door until, in bitter resignation he gets up and opens it again. 
He unrolls the Torah on the bed...Scotch tapes the tear closed...attempts to clean the stain with a moistened cloth. 
INT. DANNY'S MOTEL ROOM -- DAY 
Danny is in the bathroom in front of the mirror, holding his shirt up with his chin as he wraps the tallis around his torso. When he lowers the shirt, the fringes hang out like the tsitsis that Orthodox men wear. 
He feels a weird loathing for this, but he smooths and arranges the tsitsis to look just like a Hasid's. He clicks his heels together and gives a Nazi salute. 
DANNY Alenu l'shab'ach la'adon hacol... 
Another Nazi salute. A KNOCK at the door. He hides the fringes under the shirt, throws a blanket over the Torah. 
DANNY What? 
STEROID (O.S.) Phone, Danny. 
EXT. MOTEL -- PAY PHONE -- DAY 
GUY'S VOICE (PHONE) Danny Balint...Guy Danielsen, New York Times. 
DANNY (tucks in the tallis fringes) What do you want? What happened to your article? 
GUY'S VOICE (PHONE) I couldn't get my editor to run it, but I bet he will now that you've put a bomb in a synagogue. That was you, wasn't it, Danny? 
Danny hangs up. Stands there. A VOICE makes him jump.... 
VOICE (DRAKE) Hey, Danny, want to kill a Jew? 
Danny turns: it's Drake. These are the first words he's spoken. 
EXT. SUBURBAN STREET/INT. CAR -- DAY 
Danny and Drake pass a low-slung modern synagogue. A sign announces: AMBASSADOR ILIO MANZETTI Friday, August 31. Danny reacts, startled...Drake smiles. 
DRAKE Park up there, we'll walk back. 
EXT. CONGREGATION BETH SHALOM -- TWILIGHT 
The building is lit. Within we hear an AMPLIFIED VOICE, presumably Manzetti giving a speech. We can't make out the words. Danny and Drake are hidden among the rhododendrons flanking the parking lot. Danny is watching a door in the side of the building and eating a sandwich as Drake loads a scoped rifle. 
DRAKE Lie on your stomach and come up on your elbows. 
DANNY Why me? 
DRAKE You want to kill a Jew. I already did. 
Danny assumes the prone position, Drake sets the rifle in his hands. 
DANNY Who'd you kill? 
DRAKE Four. But no one this important. 
We hear APPLAUSE within as the speech ends. 
DRAKE Okay, it's over. He'll take a couple questions, then come out.... Sight down the rifle toward the door. 
THROUGH RIFLE SCOPE: Danny pans from the side door -- where TWO MEN are smoking -- to a waiting limousine. 
DANNY How did you know they were Jews? 
DRAKE I can tell.... 
MRS. MOEBIUS We think you'd be good at it. 
OFF-SCREEN we hear the front door. FEET come up the stairs.... 
DANNY What about...Manzetti, the synagogues.... 
CURTIS That doesn't seem to be happening, does it? 
DANNY I've been stuck out in the country with those guys who just want to paint swastikas and heil Hitler. How am I supposed to -- (get anything done there?) 
He stops short as Carla walks into the room for shopping. She glances at them, puts down her bags, goes into the kitchen.... 
CURTIS Danny, the night we met, you said the name Ilio Manzetti. We were impressed. We were excited. But here it is September, and Mr. Manzetti is still walking around breathing the air. 
MRS. MOEBIUS We need intellectuals, we have enough thugs already. 
Danny's watching Carla go down the hall toward the back, can barely bring his attention back to the conversation at hand. 
DANNY I'm not an intellectual.... I mean, I read, but... Fund-raising isn't what I... 
MRS. MOEBIUS Look, if you want to kill Jews on your free time, fine. We need you to raise money. Will you do that for us? 
He nods but cannot look at her. 
MRS. MOEBIUS Thank you. 
He's dismissed. He rises. 
MRS. MOEBIUS Do you have a suit? (off Danny; to Curtis) Let's get him one.... And a cell phone too. (as Danny turns to go; a joke for her own amusement) And if you insist on blowing up a synagogue, make it that big one on Fifth Avenue, would you? 
DANNY Beth Shalom? It's Reform. 
MRS. MOEBIUS So what? 
DANNY They're not that Jewish. 
MRS. MOEBIUS I don't care what they are. I know those people, and I don't like them. The rest are just a bunch of kikes, aren't they? 
She smiles. He manages a smile back and hurries away, face burning with shame. 
EXT. MOEBIUS APARTMENT, STREET -- NIGHT 
Danny comes out of the building, squats between two parked cars and vomits, retching spastically until, gasping for breath... 
VOICE Here... 
He turns. Carla walks over to him, wipes his mouth with a crumpled tissue. When she moves to kiss him, he holds back, shy about the smell, but she kisses him anyway, on the mouth. 
INT. DANNY'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT 
Carla, naked, browsing the books, sees something in the closet. It's the Torah Danny took from the synagogue. She unrolls it on the bed, her gaze moving over the mysterious, glossy script. Danny, coming out of the bathroom, sees what she is doing, and stops short. 
CARLA Where'd you get this? 
DANNY I stole it. From a synagogue. 
She looks at the broad printed columns.... 
CARLA How come there's no punctuation? 
DANNY That was a later invention, it's not in the scrolls.... Anyway, the Jews know where the sentences end. They know the whole thing by heart. Every word. Every letter. 
CARLA Do you know it like that? By heart. 
DANNY No. 
CARLA But you can read it, the Hebrew.... Right? 
DANNY What do you care? 
CARLA 'Cause I want to know.... What is this word? This one here... 
Danny looks at the word, then back at her. He's torn between competing desires, but finally... 
DANNY Va-yomer... And he said. (she moves her finger to the left) It goes the other way. 
CARLA (she knew that) Oh, yeah... (moves finger right) 
KYLE No, it's weird, man. Nobody knows where he went. 
Danny nods, gestures for Kyle to split. Kyle looks around, walks away. Danny waits a moment, then heads in the opposite direction. 
EXT. WILLIAMSBURG -- DAY 
Danny walking behind a Hasidic family (MAN, WOMAN, 3-year- old BOY, STROLLER)...watching them. At a corner, the father takes the boy's hand, and as they cross the street, the boy glances back at Danny. 
EXT. COUNTRY ROAD -- DAY, 1943 
TWO NAZI SOLDIERS have just discovered a JEWISH FAMILY hiding in the back of a hay wagon. The POLISH MAN is holding the little boy. 
As a soldier tries to take the BOY out of his arms, the child panics, clings to his father, screaming, "Papa... Papa..." It is the scene the survivor described in the meeting with the Nazis. But now the father is DANNY'S FATHER.... 
FATHER (IN POLISH) ...Hush, come on, don't cry. Everything will be all right.... 
A Nazi sergeant comes over, irritated. The sergeant is Danny. 
DANNY/NAZI SERGEANT (in German) What's the matter here? 
FATHER (to the Sergeant, in German) Excuse me, I'm sorry, just a moment... 
The sergeant rips the child out of his arms. The kid becomes hysterical. The father manages to take the boy's hand. 
FATHER (in Polish) Please, sweetheart, you have to go. I'll see you soon. 
In an access of disgust, the sergeant sticks his bayonet into the boy -- or rather, into something offscreen. We hear a terrible sound, the child grunts. The family gasps in horror. 
Danny/sergeant lifts the (unseen) child into the air. Its SHADOW darkens the father's face. Drops of blood run down his cheeks.... 
Danny/sergeant stares into the father's face, enraged at the man's passivity. 
DANNY/NAZI SERGEANT Fucking kike. 
EXT. STREET -- DAY 
DANNY'S FACE -- sweating, haunted, as if he's just woken from the previous. 
He's still walking down the street, but now, as if to flee his thoughts, he steps through a door into... 
INT. BOOKSTORE -- DAY 
A Jewish bookstore. He grabs the first book that comes to hand, reads for a moment, throws it down in disgust. Picks it up again, is still reading when... 
VOICE Hey, Danny...Danny... 
He looks up at a young man about his own age; wearing a yarmulke, but otherwise normal, hair clean, beard neatly trimmed. 
YOUNG MAN It's Stuart. Stuart Schoenbaum. 
DANNY Shlomo? 
STUART Yeah... 
Danny puts down the book, trying to conceal that he's been reading it. He offers a hand. Stuart manages to restrain the impulse to embrace him, but takes the hand warmly. 
STUART Jeez, it's been since, what, Kenny's wedding. 
DANNY Yeah, uh... So how are you? What's going on? 
STUART I'm in the rabbinic program at JTS... 
DANNY JTS...? 
STUART What about you? What are you doing? Something strange, I bet. 
DANNY I'm in a kind of...underground...thing. 
STUART (impressed, excited) Are you an artist? 
DANNY No, no... Not that kind of... underground. More a private... business. Private. 
Meaning he can't talk about it. Stuart nods. Danny notices a young woman: dark, curly hair, sharp eyes. 
STUART You remember Miriam.... 
DANNY Yeah, hey, how're you doing... 
INT. SAME -- ANOTHER DAY 
Slightly bigger crowd, a few middle-class-looking people. 
DANNY ...Because they're tight with money, or because they flash it around? Because they're Bolsheviks or because they're capitalists? Because they have the highest IQs, or because they have the most active sex lives? 
The audience, confused... 
DANNY Do you want to know the real reason we hate them?... 
INT. SAME -- DAY 
...More people: white collar workers of both sexes, nurses, artists. Lapel buttons, bumper stickers, backpacks: "FIGHT NEW WORLD DISORDER" "STOP THE WTO" "EARTH FIRST!" 
DANNY ...Because we hate them. (as people exchange puzzled looks) Because they exist. Because it is an axiom of civilization that just as man longs for woman, loves his children and fears death, he hates the Jews. (smiles) There is no reason. If there were, some smart-ass kike would give us an argument, try to prove we were wrong. And of course that would only make us hate them more. In fact we have all the reasons we need in three simple letters: J-E-W. Jew. Say it a million times. It is the only word that never loses its meaning: Jew Jew Jew Jew Jew Jew Jew Jew Jew Jew Jew Jew Jew.... 
EXT. NEW JERSEY MEADOWLANDS -- DAWN 
Danny and Kyle sitting in the tall grass across the marshlands toward the Manhattan skyline shimmering in the distance. 
KYLE (sings, looking at watch) "My country 'tis of thee, Sweet land of liberty, Of thee I..." 
He points sharply and an explosion occurs thirty yards away. They run over, pick up the mangled timer. They're pleased. 
EXT. JCC (ANSCHE CHESED) -- DAY 
A couple of stragglers hurry through the door as we hear... 
VOICES B'Rosh Hashanah yika-teyvun, uv'yom tsom kippur yey-chateymun... 
INT. SMALL CHAPEL -- DAY 
Rosh Hashanah services. A woman is davening.... 
WOMAN And it came to pass after these things that God tested Abraham... 
DANNY...sitting with Stuart and Miriam... 
WOMAN (O.S.) ...And said to him, "Abraham." And he said, "Here am I..." And God said, "Take your son, your only son, whom you love..." 
DANNY (to himself) It's not his only son.... 
ANOTHER VOICE The only one he loves. 
Danny looks at AVI (athletic, smooth-shaven) who grins sardonically and fakes a punch as... 
DANNY They only kill them when they love them? 
AVI (sliding into a seat next to them) What are you doing here, I thought you were a Nazi. 
STUART Come on, Avi... 
AVI You know what this guy told me once: Islam and Judaism both start with Abraham murdering his son: first sending Ishmael into the desert, then sacrificing Isaac.... 
VOICES Shhhh... Can you please be quiet? 
DANNY And Christianity's the same, with minor variations. 
AVI Ridiculous. (to the people around them) Folks, don't listen to this guy. He's a well-known anti-Semite. 
MIRIAM Avi, please... 
AVI (snatching off Danny's hat) ...Look, he's a skinhead. 
VOICES It's just a style, Avi.... There are antiracist skins. 
AVI (laughing) Believe me, Danny's the racist kind. Are you a fascist, Danny? Yes or no. 
DANNY What's a fascist? 
AVI I rest my case. He's a Jewish Nazi. He always was. 
DANNY Whereas Avi's a Zionist Nazi. 
AVI The Zionists aren't Nazis. 
DANNY They're racist, they're militaristic, they act like bullyboys in the territories.... 
DANNY About doing things. You light candles, say prayers, keep the Sabbath, visit the sick.... 
CARLA And belief follows? 
DANNY No. Nothing follows. You don't do it because it's smart or stupid or it saves your soul. You're not saved. Nobody's saved. You do it because the Torah tells you do. You submit to the Torah. 
CARLA Fuck that. 
DANNY Don't curse in front of it. 
CARLA (flips the book closed) Why should I submit? 
DANNY You shouldn't. 
CARLA You think I should just because there's no reason? 
He looks at her without answering. 
DANNY No, I think you shouldn't. 
CARLA Judaism doesn't even need God. You have the Torah, the law. That's your fucking God.... (anticipating his objections) The book's closed. 
In an access of something, she bites his arm, hard. He winces, pushes her away. She kisses the place she bit. He starts to play with her hair.... 
DANNY You're learning the Hebrew really fast. 
CARLA I told you, I'm good at this. 
DANNY Plus you have nothing else to do all day. 
CARLA Oh, am I learning it faster than you did? Maybe I'm smarter. 
He laughs, likes her arrogance. But she misunderstands: 
CARLA Is that funny? You think Jews are the only smart ones? 
As they make out, grow aroused... 
DANNY What...? You think I'm Jewish? 
CARLA It's all you talk about. Jewish, Jewish, Jewish. Nobody talks about it that much except the Jews. 
Danny's taken aback by the simple logic. 
DANNY Nazis talk about it all the time. 
CARLA Do they? 
And, of course, she has grown up among Nazis. 
DANNY The real Nazis. Hitler, Goebbels, they talked about Jews incessantly.... You ever read their diaries?... 
CARLA Is that why you became a Nazi? So you could talk about Jews incessantly? 
DANNY Believe me, Adolf Hitler couldn't possibly have hated the Jews as much as I do. Not in a billion years. You know why? 
CARLA 'Cause he wasn't a rabbi. 
DANNY You want a punch in the mouth? 
CARLA Okay... (he doesn't hit her) Why don't we light candles on Friday? Let's light candles.... And say the kaddish. 
DANNY Kaddish is the prayer for the dead. 
CARLA I mean kiddush. Let's say kiddush. And shave my head, fuck through a sheet, all that stuff... (as he walks away) Come on, just for fun. To see what it's like... 
INT. SMALL LECTURE HALL -- NIGHT 
Packed with a well-dressed crowd, very different from the crowds we've seen here before. 
DOWN IN FRONT: Mrs. Moebius and Danny talk in low tones. 
MRS. MOEBIUS Half the right-wing money in New York is here tonight. They came to see you. If you impress them, if you do what I know you can, this movement will be up and running by tomorrow. And on the front page of the New York Times in six months. 
She straightens his tie, directs him toward the lectern. He hesitates.... 
DANNY We tested the new bomb. 
Mrs. Moebius impatiently signals him to silence. 
REPORTER (O.S.) ...Paramedics arrived within ninety seconds, but Mr. Manzetti was declared dead at the scene. 
At the mention of Manzetti's name, Danny goes white. 
ANCHOR'S VOICE Ilio Manzetti was one of the respected and influential men in New York. As an investment banker, diplomat, adviser to presidents and mayors, he helped shape public policy and private finance for more than three decades. He'll be missed, Phil. This is Michael Port with New York 1. 
Danny's knees are weak, his hands cold, his stomach rises.... He becomes aware of the others, staring at him in amazement. 
DANNY (stunned) Do you think I... 
MRS. MOEBIUS Danny, please, we don't want to know. 
She and Curtis walk out of the room. Stunned, shaken, Danny leaves in a different direction. The TV plays to an empty room... 
ANCHOR'S VOICE The assailant is described as a white male in his late 20s.... 
EXT. MOEBIUS BUILDING/STREET -- DAY 
Danny wanders out the door in a daze. His cell phone RINGING. He has to search his pockets, then fumbles to turn it on.... 
KYLE'S VOICE (PHONE) You finally killed a Jew, man. How's it feel? 
DANNY Kyle...I can't talk right now.... 
He hears a CAMERA SHUTTER and MOTOR DRIVE. He turns.... 
EXT. ACROSS THE STREET -- DAY 
GUY DANIELSEN & A PHOTOGRAPHER. 
They're coming toward him. 
GUY Did you kill Ilio Manzetti? 
DANNY No. 
Suddenly Danny runs after the photographer, they struggle.... 
PHOTOGRAPHER Not the camera, don't hurt the camera... 
Danny opens the camera, rips out the film, exposing it. 
GUY Did you kill him? 
Danny glares at him without answering, walks away. Guy hurries after him.... 
GUY Two days ago you addressed a Nazi rally. Last week you went to a Torah study group. 
DANNY What were you, following me? 
GUY How do you reconcile the two? 
DANNY I don't. Look, stay out of what you don't understand. 
GUY Explain it so I can. 
DANNY You work for the New York Times. Your whole job in life is not to understand things like me. 
GUY I don't think you know what you are. 
DANNY (walking on, fast) Yeah, and what are you? A Times man? A Presbyterian? Impotent? A prick? 
GUY Who killed Manzetti? 
DANNY If I tell you, will you pull the story? Not write about me? 
GUY It's too late.... If I didn't, somebody else would. (as Danny just snorts) Yom Kippur starts at sundown. Will you go to synagogue? 
DANNY (turns on him, threatening) Get the fuck away from me. 
Guy backs off. Danny crosses the street. 
VOICE Hey, Danny, just one more! 
He glances back. It's the PHOTOGRAPHER who has reloaded and now SNAPS a shot AS DANNY TURNS AWAY and keeps going.... 
DANNY A woman of valor, who can find her? Her price is above rubies.... 
He walks out, leaving the door open. Carla starts to call after him, but then doesn't. She turns back, lights the candles and awkwardly reads the prayers.... 
EXT. STREET/PAY PHONE -- SUNDOWN APPROACHING 
Danny on a phone. Behind him, Jews hurry home for the holiday. He hears a BEEP... 
DANNY Miriam, it's me, Danny.... Come on, the holiday hasn't started, pick up the -- (as someone does) ...Is Stuart davening Ne'ilah tomorrow at the minyan... 'Cause he always does... Tell him I'm doing it instead.... 
She argues (we hear her VOICE not her words)...Danny cuts her off. 
DANNY Miriam, I'm davening.... He gives me any trouble, I'll beat the shit out of him right there in the room. I'm serious.... 
She's still talking when he hangs up and walks away. 
INT. MOEBIUS APARTMENT -- NIGHT 
Lina and Curtis with Billings and Drake, who looks bad... 
LINA Why didn't you tell us? 
DRAKE (never considered it) I was hurt. I just... 
BILLINGS He went to his friends' place and I laid up there 'til he was better. Then he called me. 
CURTIS You should've gone to the police. 
LINA I don't think Drake wants to talk to the police. Do you? 
DRAKE I'll take care of him myself. 
The phone RINGS. Curtis answers, listens, covers the mouthpiece. 
CURTIS Daniel Balint. 
She takes it with a dramatic gesture. 
LINA (takes the phone) Hello...? 
INTERCUT WITH: 
EXT. PAY PHONE, 65TH STREET -- NIGHT 
DANNY Lina... It's happening. Tonight. 
LINA What is happening? 
DANNY Beth Shalom. Like you wanted. 
LINA Beth Shalom? What are you talking about? Who is this...? 
DANNY Lina, you said if I was going to plant a bomb, I should -- 
A CLICK as she hangs up. He's pleased. He steps away from the phone. He's carrying a grease-stained bag and is across from... 
TEMPLE EMANU-EL...KOL NIDRE being sung by a soprano within; and ORGAN accompanying her. 
EXT. 5TH AVENUE AND 65TH STREET -- NIGHT 
In the synagogue across the street we hear KOL NIDRE being sung by a soprano; an ORGAN accompanying her. Danny looks up at the temple. 
FLASHCUT: EXT. FOREST ROAD -- DAY, 1943 
Looking up as the Nazi sergeant holds the boy on the bayonet over the father's head. But now Danny is the father, and the father is the sergeant. 
He lunges at the Nazi, knocking him down, tearing at this throat. The sergeant screams.... 
NAZI SOLDIER (in German, to his fellows) Kill him! 
Danny bites through the Nazi's jugular as bullets rip into him. 
INT. FIFTH AVENUE AT 65TH/INT. KYLE'S CAR -- NIGHT 
Kyle's car is parked on the Central Park side of Fifth....Danny gets in the passenger side. Kyle is behind the wheel, wiring an explosive device. Danny hands him the grease-stained bag. 
DANNY How're we doing? 
DANNY No, it has to be tomorrow. You won't get this many of them in here for another year. It'll be fine. 
KYLE It's not going to be fine. It's -- 
DANNY Just do it. 
Kyle sighs, goes about doing it, he HEARS SOMETHING and freezes. 
KYLE What's that? 
Danny clicks off the light. A SILHOUETTE on the windows... 
DANNY It's just somebody on the street. 
Light on. Relieved, Kyle turns his attention back to the bomb. 
KYLE When do you want it to go off? 
DANNY Seven-thirty tomorrow evening. 
KYLE So that's what? Nineteen thirty minutes...what time is it now... 
Kyle checks his wristwatch, sets the timer to eighteen hours eighteen minutes. It begins counting down. 
EXT. SYNAGOGUE -- NIGHT 
Kyle and Danny come around the corner, get in Kyle's car parked near the side door. 
EXT. EIGHTH AVENUE NEWSSTAND -- NIGHT 
A stack of papers, the early edition of the Times. As Danny grabs one, he notices a stack of tabloids.... 
FRONT PAGE: The Manzetti crime scene with screaming headline: "MANZETTI SLAYER JEWISH NAZI." Next to this another tab: "JEW KILLS JEW?" 
Danny grabs a Times, flips it over... We see only his face: registering this, unsurprised. He opens the paper.... 
INSERT: TWO PHOTOGRAPHS 
The sweet-faced bar mitzvah boy we saw at his father's house... And a BLURRY PHOTO of Danny walking away from Guy Danielsen and the photographer outside Mrs. Moebius's house. Danny's face is not clearly seen. 
TILT UP TO DANNY 
Calm. He tucks the paper under his arm beside the machzor and crosses Eighth Avenue toward a cheap hotel.... 
CHEAP HOTEL -- NIGHT 
Carrying the papers, Danny goes through the door. 
INT. HOTEL ROOM -- EARLY MORNING 
Danny at the window, staring out. The TV plays behind him. 
On TV -- A REPORTER INTERVIEWING MRS. MOEBIUS 
REPORTER ...You're saying that when he first appeared at your house, you had no idea he was Jewish.... 
MRS. MOEBIUS None whatsoever. But I have to admit, I'm not terribly surprised. 
REPORTER What do you mean? 
MRS. MOEBIUS I think anti-semitism today is largely a Jewish phenomenon. Wouldn't you agree? 
Danny can't help smiling at her audacity. 
REPORTER In the Third Reich, weren't a number of high-ranking Nazis of Jewish origin? 
MRS. MOEBIUS Yes, and they were said to be the most virulent proponents of the Final Solution. Really, who but a Jew would want to kill Ilio Manzetti simply because he was Jewish? Who thinks about such things? 
REPORTER The papers are going to report tomorrow that your colleague, Curtis Zampf, has been a federal informant for the past two years. Do you believe that? 
MRS. MOEBIUS (enigmatic smile) Curtis is always more complicated than he seems. Even now. 
REPORTER (to the camera) And so, on this, the most solemn day of the Jewish year, a former yeshiva student is being sought in connection with a monstrous hate crime that -- 
The set is CLICKED OFF with the remote. In the darkened screen, we see Danny take his bag off the bed and go out the door. 
EXT. JEWISH COMMUNITY CENTER -- LATE AFTERNOON 
Chuckles. 
ENRAGED WIFE I saw the paper. That's not him, that guy was darker.... This is somebody else. 
VOICE (O.S.) That guy wouldn't go to shul, Barry... 
ENRAGED MAN You want to bet? I'll bet you anything... (he's SHUSHED, "Could you, please...") Let's go, we're leaving.... 
ENRAGED WIFE Oh, for God's sake, you leave. 
ENRAGED MAN I'm going to get a cop. 
He stalks to the door but doesn't leave, turns back as if compelled to watch this outrage...as.... 
DANNY Da-amiran b'alma, v'imru amen... 
He begins the silent amidah, taking three steps backward, then three forward, bowing as he prays so that he sees the watch on the lectern.... It says: 6:16.... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. A ROOM -- SUNDOWN 
Kyle on hands and knees, gasping for breath, his face bloody. DRAKE sits in a chair, injecting methamphetamine into the vein of his forearm. Billings comes through the door with a newspaper. 
BILLINGS I got one.... 
He squats beside Kyle, shows him the Times story about Danny. 
KYLE Are you kidding me?? 
BILLINGS Now do you know where he is? 
Kyle thinks, glances at a watch: 6:47. 
KYLE Yeah, I bet I do. 
INT. SMALL AUDITORIUM -- TWILIGHT 
The windows have darkened. The congregation is on its feet chanting the AVINU MALKENU, the climactic prayer of the day. 
Danny, leading the prayers, looks up at Carla, Stuart, Miriam...near the front, chanting with him. He looks at the clock: 7:21. 
Suddenly it seems impossible to go through with this. He stops praying, but no one notices.... 
EXT. JEWISH COMMUNITY CENTER -- TWILIGHT 
As Kyle, Drake and Billings approach, the place seems to glow with an inner radiance. Drake and Billings hold weapons at their sides. 
The stocky security guard sees them coming and gets up, reaching for his gun. Billings and Drake stop. Kyle wishes he weren't here. 
Everything suspends for a moment as, within the building, three distinct GROUPS OF VOICES can be heard, each chanting the AVINU MALKENU at a slightly different point in the prayer. 
Drake raises his gun and fires. 
INT. JEWISH COMMUNITY CENTER -- SMALL AUDITORIUM -- TWILIGHT 
People are chanting AVINU MALKENU so fervently that the GUNFIRE outside seems only a faint POPPING. No one particularly notices. Danny, freaking, doesn't hear the gunshots. He tries to address the people in the front rows.... 
DANNY Wait a minute... 
But the praying is too loud, too strong. No one stops or listens. He steps down off the bema.... 
DANNY Stop praying. You've got to get out of here.... All of you... 
A few people in front are puzzled by his strange behavior, but the rest keep chanting. Stuart comes up to Danny.... 
STUART You wanted to daven. Now daven.... 
Danny glances over people's heads at the clock: 7:25. He doesn't notice... 
THE DOOR 
BANGS open. DRAKE stands there, .357, bleeding profusely from the head, the swastika on his lips. At first, only a few people notice, they stop praying. 
PEOPLE (panic, confusion) Who's that?... What is he...oh, my God... 
Avi is the first one out of his chair, walks right at Drake.

FADE IN: 
EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT 
Across the inky swell, a river of moonlight cuts a path to a lonely fishing tug drifting with the tide. THE MERRY WIDOW. 
INT. MERRY WIDOW GALLEY - NIGHT 
A light bulb waltzes with the sway of the boat. Three shabby Irish fishermen unwind after dinner, playing cards. 
The eldest and scruffiest (the SKIPPER) reveals his hand to a young deckhand (GREG). Read 'em and weep. 
GREG You can't be serious? 
Laughing, the Skipper unspools himself from the cramped table as he and ROY, the bloated first-mate, clamber above deck. 
GREG Every bloody night. 
EXT. MAIN DECK - NIGHT 
Roy and the Skipper check the hauled in nets, until ... 
A SILENT ARC OF LIGHT SLICES ACROSS THE SKY.     It careens downwards in a furious trajectory and -- 
BOOM!!   A mile off their port it collides with the sea. 
ROY Did you see that? 
SKIPPER ... Yeah. 
ROY A flare? 
The Skipper watches the water.     Unsure. 
Greg leaps on deck brandishing a clutch of cards. 
GREG Ye cheated! There's five aces!    I counted 'em! 
The Skipper brushes past Greg, distracted. 
SKIPPER Secure the lines. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011          2. 
Greg looks to Roy. 
GREG Not so funny now, huh? 
Roy plucks one of the five aces from Greg's hand and flips it over. Its backing is red. 
ROY It's from a different deck, ya muppet. 
He sticks it to Greg's damp forehead and carries on as ordered. Greg turns the remaining aces over. They're blue. 
GREG ... Shite. 
EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT 
Foam rises as bubbles crest violently. Closing in, the Merry Widow casts its searchlight across the churning surf. 
INT. PILOTHOUSE / EXT. OCEAN 
The Skipper steers carefully, holding a radio mic. 
SKIPPER (INTO MIC) Haven Point. Haven Point. Haven Point. This is Fishing tug Merry Widow. Call sign echo whiskey niner ait fife. Position five nautical miles west of Erin Island. Responding to unknown distress flare. Over. 
The Skipper pulls back on the throttle, sloshing to a stop. 
He taps the sonar screen.     A hazy shadow engulfs the readout. 
SKIPPER Definitely something ... 
COASTGUARD (O.S.) Hold your position, Merry Widow, rescue chopper on its way. Over. 
Greg drops the mic and edges outside. 
EXT. MAIN DECK - NIGHT 
The deck swims with water.      Greg holds his breath, listening. 
GREG Skipper? 
The abandoned C.B. mic swings to and fro.        Almost playfully. 
COASTGUARD (O.S.) Merry Widow, how many aboard? Over. 
Greg rounds the pilothouse, breathing heavily. 
Suddenly what looks like a weird, headless black snake feels its way towards his boots. Greg turns and bolts. 
He scrambles to the stern amongst the nets and snatches a gutting-knife with both hands. 
Trapped against the rail, panting, he prays for help but -- 
-- HE'S DRAGGED OVERBOARD.      His legs round in the air as he cascades into the sea. 
EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT 
Just beyond the Merry Widow, he surfaces gasping. 
GREG Oh Jesus.    Oh Jesus.   Oh Jes-- 
He's gone. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011       6. 
EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT 
In the moonlight the isolated Merry Widow reposes mournfully. 
G   R   A   B   B   E   R   S 
INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING 
CIARÁN O'SHEA lies face down on a sofa. His bed for the night. He gropes a dry bottle of whiskey as a mobile phone RINGS. He stirs awake. It's no surprise he looks like shite, but to be fair he's not bad looking after a wash. 
O'SHEA Uh ... Yeah? 
Someone we'll meet later as SGT KENIFICK replies. 
KENIFICK'S VOICE (via speaker phone) O'Shea, I take it you've left already because if you haven't, you're late. That ferry gets in at nine. 
O'Shea rises, eyes closed.       Mouth dry. 
KENIFICK'S VOICE Where are you? 
O'SHEA ... On the way. 
KENIFICK'S VOICE So you're in the car? 
O'SHEA ... Yeah ... 
KENIFICK'S VOICE So you're driving while on the phone?! 
O'SHEA ... No. 
KENIFICK'S VOICE In the name of God, I don't b-- 
O'Shea hangs up and drops his whiskey bottle in a bin where it CLATTERS with yesterday's bottle, and the day before's. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011          7. 
EXT. O'SHEA'S HOUSE - MORNING 
An isolated house at the foothills of a mountain.    A white Garda patrol jeep leaves the scene and -- 
EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - MORNING 
-- rambles along the sunny coast.   At the wheel, O'Shea is a very hungover, droopy eyed Garda. 
EXT. ERIN ISLAND - MORNING 
Lush green hills and whitewashed bungalows, pastel beaches and multi-coloured fishing boats. Enchanting. 
EXT. MARINA FERRY DOCK - DAY 
Colourful crowds of FAMILIES (TEENS, KIDS, PARENTS) file onto the MAINLAND FERRY as it lies moored in the harbour. 
GARDA LISA NOLAN hustles through the masses dragging a trolley bag and passing a sign that reads: 
OILEÁN ÉIRINN, CÉAD MÍLE FÁILTE Welcome to Erin Island 
Lisa opens a map and wrestles with it in the wind.   Soon defeated, it blows out of her hands. 
LISA I'll take it black, thanks. 
Kenifick's mobile RINGS and he silences it. 
KENIFICK So you can have my desk while I'm gone. O'Shea will tell you, 'tis mostly administrative, processing permits and that sort. You might catch the odd bit of commotion every now and then but half the island's leaving for the show in Dungary so it'll be dead all weekend. 
LISA I'm sure we can find something to do. 
O'Shea rolls his eyes and passes Lisa her coffee. 
LISA Ta. 
She takes it and sits at her desk, feeling her surroundings. 
O'SHEA (whispered to Kenifick) Is she really necessary? 
KENIFICK You tell me. 
Lisa carefully arranges her desk how she likes it.     Neat. 
O'SHEA You're only gone two weeks.      I can handle two weeks. 
KENIFICK You could.     But you wouldn't. 
Kenifick's mobile PINGS.      He checks the text message. 
KENIFICK Don't be late, I said.      What did I say? 
His phone RINGS again. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011          11. 
KENIFICK I'm coming, I'm coming.    Right, I'm off. 
LISA Not a bother. 
KENIFICK Rightio. Reports and files in the top drawer, anything you need, O'Shea will be here to show you round. O'Shea? 
O'SHEA You're gonna miss your boat. 
KENIFICK Slán. 
Kenifick leaves. An uncomfortable silence fills the air like two strangers in an elevator. Lisa sips her coffee. Hates it. O'Shea slumps at his desk, throws his feet up and sighs. 
Kenifick barges back in and O'Shea falls over himself to straighten up, burning himself with his coffee. 
KENIFICK Won't go far with no tickets.    See you in a fortnight. Be good. 
He snatches them and leaves. O'Shea recovers and notices Lisa stifling a smile. The office phone RINGS and O'Shea sluggishly reaches for it. But Lisa beats him to it. 
LISA Garda Nolan. 
EXT. FISHING PORT (BY MAHER'S PUB) - DAY 
At the dock PADDY BARRETT sorts his lobster traps.   All he's short is a parrot and a wooden leg. 
His traps appear empty, some mangled, but before he can protest one of the oblong traps leaps. He watches it and like a magic trick it leaps again. 
He squats down and gazes between the seaweed strewn cage. Nothing to be seen thanks to the seaweed. He prods it and lo, it shifts violently. Hopping mad. 
Paddy rises, wipes his frowning forehead with his cap and gestures to a fisherman packing ice crates on the dock. 
TADHG MURPHY saunters over.    An alpha male in a beta body. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011            12. 
PADDY Take a look at this. 
Paddy gently kicks the lobster trap, spurring it. On cue, it haphazardly jumps across the wet dock. Tadhg snickers. 
TADHG He's a biggun. 
PADDY He's not a lobster. 
TADHG Then what is it? 
Paddy shrugs.   Tadhg kneels down and peers inside. 
SPLAT! A GEYSER OF GOO SPRAYS IN HIS FACE!        Tadhg staggers to his feet, spitting furiously. 
TADHG Oh ya bastard, Paddy!      Ya knew it was gonna do that. 
PADDY I didn't.    On me life. 
Tadhg wipes away the slime with his sweater. 
TADHG Eurgh, the smell. 
PADDY So what is it? 
TADHG I dunno, it's a feckin octopus or something, it's covered in seaweed. But 'tis no feckin' lobster! 
SMITH (writing in a pad) One second. 
Lisa's eyes light up at Smith's dismissal of O'Shea. A kindred spirit. Once Smith's ready, he ignores O'Shea and removes a glove to shake Lisa's hand. So very English. 
SMITH Smith. 
LISA Lisa. 
O'Shea stares at her.   Typical. 
O'SHEA Smith's a marine psychologist or something, did I get that right? 
SMITH No.   It's marine ecology. 
O'Shea shrugs, whatever. 
LISA That was quick. 
SMITH More fortunate really. I'm based here doing studies for the department of the marine. 
Smith hands O'Shea the tip of a tape measure. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011       16. 
SMITH Hold this, please. 
O'Shea doesn't have a choice. Smith walks the length of the whales, stepping around Lisa and touching her as he goes. 
SMITH So how long are you here? 
LISA Two weeks. 
SMITH Oh, wonderful. Wonderful.   Are you staying nearby? 
O'Shea interrupts, deliberately: 
O'SHEA So are they dead?! 
SMITH Hmm?   No, they're just sleeping. 
Smith and Lisa share a smirk. O'Shea notices and lets the tape measure go, snapping back on Smith's fingers. Ouch. 
O'SHEA Slipped. 
O'Shea and Smith trade looks. 
LISA So what happened? 
SMITH Well they're pilot whales. It happens with them from time to time but no one really knows why. 
Lisa notes deep spider-vein gashes on the whales' bodies as if they were whipped with a huge cat-o'-nine-tails. 
LISA What are those marks? 
SMITH Not sure. Possible scratches off the rocks while washing up here. 
LISA They didn't beach themselves? GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011            17. 
SMITH No, they died at sea. 
O'SHEA All of them? At once? 
SMITH It's a strange one all right. 
O'Shea considers the ocean before him. 
EXT. PADDY'S HOUSE - DAY 
A charming little shithole. 
INT. PADDY'S BATHROOM - DAY 
Paddy kicks open the bathroom door.   He plugs the bathtub and lets the tap run, filling it. 
He shuffles out and returns wearing a welders mask and dragging the lobster trap. He lifts the trap over the bath rim and drops it into the bath water where it BUBBLES. 
He removes his mask and peers in at it.   What the feck? 
EXT. DERELICT SITE - DAY 
A dilapidated mill, long since operational. A sign reads "KEEP OUT".   The jeep pulls up and O'Shea and Lisa step out. 
O'SHEA Hey, Daly, Cooney about? 
On the rim of a demolished "pit" DALY points to a ramp. Years of labouring have turned Daly into one big freckle. O'Shea follows Daly's directions up a ramp towards the demolished frame of a building. 
Daly elbows his MATE, ogling Lisa. 
DALY Now that is one arresting woman. 
O'Shea leans on the counter, a whiskey before him. Avuncular proprietor BRIAN MAHER watches from behind the counter. 
ON A PUB TV: the white helicopter of the Coastguard circles the Merry Widow boat. Footage taken earlier in the day. 
RTE REPORTER (V.O.) (over TV images) -- search and rescue was called off as a search and recover operation became priority. A telling sign that the missing fishermen are believed to have perished. 
Lisa approaches the counter/reception and hands Brian a key. 
LISA Hi, do you have an iron? 
BRIAN We do indeed. 
Brian moves to get it and Lisa spots O'Shea, throwing her. Shoeless, she rises up on her toes. Gaining two inches. 
LISA Hi. 
An awkward silence. 
O'SHEA Would you like a drink? 
UNA MAHER eavesdrops while wiping the counter.   Una has a face you could confide in, but shouldn't. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011       21. 
LISA Another time, maybe. 
Brian hands Lisa the iron. 
LISA Thanks. (TO O'SHEA) See you tomorrow. 
O'SHEA Tomorrow's Sunday. 
LISA Oh, right. Well, I have a key so ... see you Monday then. 
She walks off and Una moves in, wiping under O'Shea's drink. 
UNA Sparks flying there, huh. 
O'SHEA What? 
UNA Do you like her? 
O'SHEA She's all right. A bit uptight. 
UNA You should talk to her. 
O'SHEA I do talk to her.    I talked to her all day. 
UNA God, ye're all the same. 
BRIAN Ah leave him off, Una. 
UNA Listen to you. (to O'Shea; about Brian) Eight years I was waiting for him to get down on his knee. Have ya ever heard the like of it? My family thought I was mad wasting me time on him. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011          22. 
BRIAN Ah feck them. 
UNA Ah feck you, Brian. 
Una shuffles off. 
BRIAN Same again? 
O'SHEA Go on. 
BRIAN I tell you what though if I weren't, you know, I'd be up them stairs like a shot. 
Brian feels Una's stare from across the bar.    He smiles at her, placating. 
Grinning to himself at the far end of the counter, Paddy fixes O'Shea's stare. 
O'SHEA What is it, Paddy? 
PADDY Wouldn't you like to know? 
O'SHEA No, not really. 
O'Shea turns back to his drink. 
PADDY But you would, though. 
O'SHEA Nope. 
PADDY You would! If you were to know what I know you'd want to know. 
O'SHEA All right, tell us then. 
Paddy shuffles closer, all excited. 
PADDY Right, between you and me, I caught meself a sea monster today. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011   23. 
O'Shea changes weight to his other leg and accidentally kicks over Lisa's side-table. 
O'SHEA Feck. 
It clatters to the floor, knocking her toiletries over. 
O'SHEA Sorry. 
LISA It's OK. 
He helps her pick them up -- 
O'SHEA (notices a 'Stress Ball') What's that? GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011        26. 
Lisa grabs it off him, mortified as he rises with a headrush. 
O'SHEA Whoa, that last drink's gone straight to me head. 
LISA Just your head? 
O'SHEA Well, other places too. 
O'Shea grins suggestively, reading her wrong. 
LISA Do you get this drunk every night? 
O'SHEA Just high days and holidays. 
O'Shea rests against the wall.       Eyes drooping. 
LISA Let's get you to bed. 
O'SHEA Now you're talking. 
EXT. GARDEN PATH - NIGHT 
Paddy crashes his bicycle into a fence and staggers in the gate, mumbling something about bastards and fences. 
INT. PADDY'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Paddy pours himself a drink of what looks like homemade potcheen. Still muttering. 
THUD!    The bathroom door rattles.    He looks at it, wide-eyed. 
INT. PADDY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT 
The door yawns opens and Paddy creeps in, wearing his welders mask. He gazes into the tub and removes his mask. There just as he left it is the lobster trap, but it's BROKEN. 
Paddy leans down and checks the trap as behind him reflected through the slimy residue of his bathroom cabinet's mirror something black and slithery crawls up the wall behind him. 
We see it but Paddy doesn't until a HISS. Paddy turns and the GRABBER spits a barbed tongue and whips itself onto his face. Paddy slams against the bathroom mirror, as if leveled by a punch. The mirror shatters, obscuring the scuffle. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011         27. 
Paddy tears it off his face, gasping and flings it away. Blood seeps from a three point puncture wound on his neck. 
PADDY You dirty ... 
Paddy stamps on it, whatever it is. Again and again, until out of breath, he staggers from the bathroom. A moment later he returns with a standing lamp and continues beating it. Over and over and over until he's exhausted. 
PADDY Bastard. 
EXT. BUNGALOW - NIGHT 
The warm glow of light from within would attract every moth within a mile if it were a dry Summer's night, but it's not. It's raining and it's attracting something far more sinister. 
INT. BEDROOM / BUNGALOW - NIGHT 
IRENE MURPHY, cocooned in a bathrobe and slippers, snatches a pair of socks and a sweater off the floor. Muttering, she sniffs the sweater and recoils. It reeks. 
On a mission she marches through the open plan home passing Fisherman Tadhg gazing at the TV. 
IRENE Tadhg, you're stinking. Would you get in the bath already, I can smell you from here. 
TADHG I'm watching this. 
IRENE (TO HERSELF) What were you doing at all today? 
Irene enters the kitchen -- 
EXT. KITCHEN - NIGHT 
-- and dumps it in a wash basket for tomorrow's load -- 
A BANG against the window. Irene startles. She leans, hands cupped around her eyes pressed up against the glass, staring out into the darkness. Any second now she's going to be pulled through ... only not. She tightens her robe instead. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011     28. 
IRENE (TO HERSELF) God, 'tis blowing a gale out. 
TADHG (O.S.) What? 
A WEIRD, PITCHED ROAR takes Irene's breath away.    Whatever snatched Tadhg sounds unnatural, huge and mean. 
Soot tumbles down the chimney drawing Irene's attention. 
She runs and kneels before the fireplace and receives a blast of black soot to the face. She coughs and sputters and reaches up to close the chimney chute. Fumbling, whimpering. 
INSIDE THE CHIMNEY CHUTE 
Something descends towards her, gaining speed.   Irene grabs blindly at the clasp ... 
Her eyes dart open. That's not the clasp! She SCREAMS and flies up the chute like a mouse sucked up a hoover. And as her CRIES die out all that's left in the open fireplace is a pair of orphaned fluffy pink slippers. 
INT. MAHER'S PUB - MORNING 
Lisa DINGS the reception bell.   Una stumbles to her call. 
UNA Good morning. Sleep well? 
LISA Grand, thanks. Do I have something to sign? 
UNA Oh yeah.   The big one. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011          31. 
Una grabs her bill and hands it to Lisa. 
LISA How's the weather looking? 
UNA Oh, there's a storm coming. 
LISA Really? Are the gulls flying low or something? 
UNA No, it's on the telly. 
Una gestures to the TV weather report. Lisa smiles.   Of course. She fishes out her credit card. 
UNA So, you're working with O'Shea? 
LISA Temporarily. 
UNA He's a nice fella isn't he?    Quite a catch. 
LISA Depends what you're fishing. 
Una hands Lisa her receipt to sign and watches her writing. 
UNA Single? (off Lisa's nod) So's O'Shea. Well, widowed. 
Lisa looks up. 
LISA Widowed? 
UNA Why do you think he's here? Sure there's no want for him round this neck of the woods but I suppose he wanted the peace. Or his superiors thought he did. He doesn't say, God love him. 
Lisa smiles uncomfortably and hands her receipt to Una. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011        32. 
UNA So will you be sticking to the same room all week? Because we have a few doubles. There's more room in those, you know yourself. 
Una winks knowingly. 
LISA The single room is fine. 
UNA Are you sure now? You never know if you want to stretch your legs later on. Give it a week and we'll be booked solid, so we will. 
LISA I'll think about it. 
Lisa hightails it. 
INT. CELL, GARDA STATION - MORNING 
Panned out on a rubber mattress you'd swear O'Shea was dead if he wasn't SNORING like a Granddad. 
The heavy cell door flies open and SLAMS off the wall.   Lisa stand in the doorway as O'Shea jerks awake. 
LISA Morning. 
O'SHEA Wha..? 
LISA How much does a place like this go for? I mean it's close to the beach, all mod-cons. It's perfect. 
O'SHEA I ... uh, what happened? 
LISA Section four point one of the Public Order Act. It is an offence for any person to be present in any public place while intoxicated to such an extent as would give rise to a reasonable apprehension that the person might endanger themselves or any other in the vicinity. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011       33. 
O'SHEA You arrested me?! 
LISA For your own good. 
O'SHEA Let me out of here. 
Smith takes hold of its tongue and extends it three foot with a barbed tip like a mace. Off O'Shea and Lisa's awed faces. 
LISA That's not a tongue. 
O'SHEA It's a weapon. 
PADDY It spits like a frog and strangles ya. Whippet fast, and sharp. 
SMITH I'm guessing it bleeds its prey like a leech. Consuming the blood, like some sort of vampiro toothis. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011       36. 
O'SHEA Vampiro what? 
SMITH Toothis. It's a rare deep sea squid but this isn't that, not in Irish waters. No, this is something totally different. Something ... alien. (off their looks) In that it's undocumented. 
PADDY It's gotta be worth a fortune. 
SMITH But here's the thing... 
Smith picks up a sponge, daubs it in a tray of water and -- 
SMITH -- When I tried to clean some dirt off of it -- 
PADDY I stood on it a few times. 
SMITH -- this happened -- 
-- he delicately dabs the tip of a tentacle. The Grabber's skin reacts, rehydrating. Smith watches it expectantly. 
Suddenly the tip twitches.    Smith smiles at them. 
SMITH All this thing needs to survive is blood ... and water. 
O'Shea frowns, watching it. 
PADDY Could you put it on the eBay, do ya think? 
SMITH You are not putting this on eBay. You're lucky she didn't kill you. 
O'SHEA She? GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011           37. 
SMITH Yeah, it's a female from what I can tell. 
PADDY How can you tell? 
SMITH It's got no testicles. 
A long silence, Paddy nods.    I see. 
SMITH And ... she was pregnant. 
He reveals an EGG SPAWN. Gelatine and gooey. Inside is a baby Grabber; a Jack-in-the-box type creature aka a JUMPER. 
LISA That's disgusting. 
Lisa recoils: it stinks.   Smith toys with it, marveling. 
SMITH We're dealing with something extraordinary here. And if it looks like this when it hatches, then this species nests on land. 
O'Shea and Lisa share a look.   Uh oh. 
INT./EXT. PATROL JEEP - DAY 
O'Shea switches gears as they make their way along the coast. 
LISA Do you reckon those things had anything to do with those dead whales? 
O'Shea considers her, thinking. They pass the promenade and O'Shea cranes his head to see something. 
LISA What is it? 
O'SHEA That's Declan Cooney's car. 
EXT. BEACH PROMENADE - DAY 
Cooney's car sits abandoned, its door open and airbag flat. O'Shea and Lisa pull in behind it and step out of the jeep. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011            38. 
O'SHEA Cooney?! 
O'Shea takes a LEPRECHAUN KEYCHAIN from the ignition, then notes some unusual scratches along the car's body work. 
LISA Where could he be? 
O'SHEA Nowhere without his keys.    Do you believe in coincidences? 
LISA Not really. 
O'SHEA Neither do I. 
LISA Oh the Divine Mother of Jesus -- 
Lisa leans sharply out of its way as down below: O'Shea sneaks a sip of his flask. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011          41. 
LISA Watch out! 
O'Shea looks up to see 
TADHG'S SEVERED HEAD spinning towards him.    BOP!   Headbutted in the face, O'Shea clutches his nose. 
O'SHEA Aw Jesus Cock! 
Lisa looks down at the gawping severed head, sickened. 
LISA You broke its nose. 
INT. DOCTOR'S SURGERY - DAY 
Dr Gleeson replaces a sheet over Tadhg's head as Lisa paces on a mobile phone, O'Shea watching. 
O'SHEA What killed him, Jim? 
DR GLEESON The fact he's just a head! 
Dr Gleeson turns back, writing. 
DR GLEESON Jesus what do you think? You bring me someone with a head cold or a headache and I could do something. You bring me just a head and you're taking the piss. 
LISA (INTO PHONE) So when can they get here? ... (for O'Shea's benefit) Tomorrow? ... And what about the state pathologist? 
DR GLEESON They could bury him in a shoebox. That's not right. 
LISA (hand over receiver) Doctor, we need to know. 
DR GLEESON I don't know. A tiger? GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011            42. 
O'SHEA A tiger?! 
LISA I can't say that. 
Dr Gleeson loosens his tie. 
DR GLEESON I'm telling you his head was torn off. By something big. 
O'Shea shares a look with Lisa. 
INT. GARDA STATION - DAY 
O'Shea uploads crime scene photos of Tadhg's bungalow onto a laptop as Lisa paces on the phone. 
LISA (INTO PHONE) No, no, don't put me through I've already spoken to -- ugh. Thanks. 
Lisa sighs.   She's been at this a while, it seems. 
O'Shea pulls his hip flask from his jacket pocket and furtively sneaks a sip, savouring it. 
PADDY Holy Christ, wait till I tell ya! 
O'Shea chokes on his drink, coughing.     He spins to face Paddy, quickly hiding his flask. 
O'SHEA Jesus, Paddy. 
PADDY What?   What's wrong with ya? 
O'SHEA What is it? 
PADDY Come look for yourself. 
Lisa looks at O'Shea.   A silent exchange.   Lisa hangs up. 
INT. PADDY'S BATHROOM - DAY 
A demolished wall offers a new entrance to the backyard, where amongst rubble, Paddy's scratched bathtub lays. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011       43. 
PADDY How am I supposed to wash meself? 
O'Shea thinks... 
INT. PADDY'S HOUSE - DAY - SECONDS LATER 
O'Shea unrolls a map of Erin Island on the living room table. He points at four spots on the map. A zig-zag pattern. 
O'SHEA OK, we're here. Here's where Cooney's car was abandoned. Here's Tadhg and Irene Murphy's house and here's where the whales washed up. 
LISA OK, so what does that mean? 
O'Shea stares blankly. 
PADDY We're here. 
EXT. BEACH, CAVE MOUTH - DAY 
They stand before the cave mouth, taking it in. Dark and oppressive and claustrophobic. Water drips within. A wave washes up behind them, drenching their feet. 
PADDY Tides coming in. Another hour and this place will be under water. 
O'SHEA Wait here. 
PADDY You can be sure of it. 
Lisa and O'Shea turn on their high beam flashlights and venture into the cave, Mulder and Scully style. 
Water drips from the cave walls while the sound of crashing waves echoes throughout. 
At the cave mouth, the dregs of a wave wash over Paddy's boots. He looks into the cave, anxiously. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011       47. 
Venturing further into the shadowy cave, Lisa finds an arched entrance to the rising ocean as fog creeps around her feet. 
O'Shea rounds some rocks, finding Lisa and seeing her flashlight has found a fisherman's shredded slicker. (The remains of the Merry Widow's Deckhand Greg.) 
LISA Are we missing some fishermen? 
O'SHEA (CALLS OUT) Hello! 
Lisa jolts, startled by O'Shea. 
LISA My heart!    What are you doing? 
O'SHEA Just checking. Well, if you know of a better way? (CALLS AGAIN) Hello?! 
LISA What are you expecting?   "Helloooo, 'tis only me." 
A SHADOW rises up stealing the light. O'Shea and Lisa turn. They lift the flashlights and take in the horrifying sight. 
O'SHEA Run! 
They take off, running for the slim cave mouth. Their lights dancing in the darkness as they scramble for the exit -- leading onto the beach. The narrow gap allows just one person at a time. And at a push. Lisa edges through first. 
INT./EXT. BEACH CAVE OPENING - DAY - CONTINUOUS 
O'Shea waits behind Lisa, watching behind them, and sees the light of his flashlight go dark, swallowed by something coming his way. 
O'SHEA Lisa!   Hurry! 
LISA I'm trying! 
O'SHEA Move your arse! GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011         48. 
O'Shea pushes on her arse as she squeezes through. 
LISA Get your hands off my arse! 
O'Shea shoves harder. 
LISA I swear to God, if you don't stop! 
Lisa kicks back at him, but he keeps pushing. She tumbles onto the seaweed strewn sands, drenched by the incoming tide, as O'Shea squeezes through next. Soon, wedged in himself. 
O'SHEA If I die in here I want you to know it's all your fault! 
LISA Oh shut up. 
Lisa wraps her arms around O'Shea, cheek-to-awkwardly- intimate-cheek and pulls, dragging him loose. With effort. 
The Grabber rushes towards O'Shea, gaining speed.    Almost on him when he escapes, seconds to spare. 
BAM! The Grabber fills the gap in the rock face, trapped by its own bulk. It snarls as one of its tentacles slithers out towards them, but quickly retreats back inside. 
LISA The size of it. 
They back up, horrified. 
O'SHEA It's OK. It can't get us on dry land. Not when it's not raining, it can't. 
WHIPAH! A barbed tongue shoots out from the darkness of the cave and lances O'Shea's Garda hat clean off his head. O'Shea blinks, feeling his bare head. 
O'SHEA ... What? 
A THUNDER-CRACK from the ominous rain clouds. 
LISA Leg it! GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011       49. 
EXT. BEACH - DAY 
Paddy steps out of the way of an oncoming wave and kicks something with his heel. He kneels down and finds an EGG. 
SMITH OK, it's an alien. 
O'Shea feels his wounds. Furious, he grabs one of the mops surrounding him and jabs at the Grabber with the handle. 
O'SHEA You vicious little fu--! 
The Grabber bites down on the handle and hangs on. O'Shea suddenly takes the full weight of it. It totters above their heads, swaying. Lisa and Smith duck. 
LISA Ah!    Jesus! O'Shea! GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011        52. 
O'Shea drops it onto the floor and Lisa yanks a steel cabinet over, pinning it down. Trapped, the Grabber thrashes. 
O'SHEA We need to kill it. 
SMITH No! You can't! It's the scientific discovery of our time, imagine all that we could learn FROM -- 
The cabinet flips,   exposing the Grabber. Smith SCREAMS and brains it with his   stool. Scared shitless, O'Shea and Lisa pile in with their   boots. All three whacking and stamping until they're sure   it's dead. 
Sweating and in shock, they catch their breath. 
SMITH I think we got it. 
O'SHEA (PATS SMITH) Good man. 
O'Shea flicks the Grabber goop out of his hair. 
SMITH It's still moving. 
LISA We need to get help. 
O'SHEA They'll never make it across the water. 
LISA If those eggs hatch, with no whales to eat -- 
SMITH -- they'll head in land to feed. 
O'SHEA Finishing each other's sentences now? 
LISA What? 
O'SHEA Nothing. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011       53. 
PADDY They're hatching. 
The trio turn to notice Paddy has joined them looking down at the smooshed Grabber. O'Shea considers Paddy. 
O'SHEA It took three of us to get that thing off me. 
PADDY I woulda helped but I've a bad back, gives me shocking pain, you know yourself. 
O'SHEA How are you still alive? 
PADDY Diet and exercise. 
O'SHEA No, when that thing attacked you. You should be laid out in a box right now, but you're not. What makes you so special? 
PADDY I was always lucky. 
O'Shea disregards him and takes a swig of his flask as Lisa considers the bloody sick. Queasy. 
SMITH Mustn't have liked your blood much. 
LISA What have you been eating? 
O'Shea stills, hearing that question. 
O'SHEA (TO PADDY) You were drunk! 
EXT. MAHER'S PUB - DAY 
Storm clouds gather over the idyllic drinking hole as gales jeer and waves pile on the pub's neighbouring harbour. 
INT. DR GLEESON'S SURGERY - DAY 
Dr Gleeson peers at the Grabber's severed head in a beaker, gawping away like a fish head. He squirms. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011       54. 
DR GLEESON Grabbers? 
SMITH No, it's a cryptozoological amphibious sanguivore. 
LISA (to Dr Gleeson) Not a tiger. 
Dr Gleeson removes his glasses to stare at O'Shea. 
DR GLEESON Where are you getting all these heads? 
O'SHEA Come on. 
She leaves, grinning. 
BRIAN Great. It's her birthday next week now she thinks this is something for her. 
DR GLEESON She's in for a shock. 
EXT. MAHER'S PUB - DAY 
O'Shea, Lisa, Smith, Brian and Dr Gleeson huddle. 
O'SHEA Listen, the only people that know about this are us and it's gotta stay that way or we'll have a panic on our hands. 
The group confer, sharing glances. 
LISA How drunk are we talking here? 
SMITH Paddy levels of drunkenness. 
They laugh loudly. 
DR GLEESON You're gone off your game, boy. 
LISA No offence but I don't think my body can handle Paddy levels. 
PADDY It takes years of practice. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011      58. 
BRIAN If those things do come for us, we'd be lambs to the slaughter if bombed out of our brains. 
LISA And with everyone hammered there's no one in a fit state to call the shots. The non-alcoholic shots. 
DR GLEESON Yeah but single someone out and they'll be sought as the only meat on the menu. 
LISA But what's to keep us safe from ourselves, forget what's outside, we could fall over and break our necks trying to conga. Statistics prove put a large number of people in a confined space, ply them with booze and -- 
PADDY -- you've got a hooley. 
LISA That's not what it said. 
O'SHEA This will work. And I'll keep order. I won't be drinking. 
Lisa almost steps back to take a closer look of him. 
LISA You?   We'll both do it. 
SMITH That would put you both at risk.    I suggest it's just O'Shea. 
O'SHEA Thanks. (TO LISA) Only one of us need risk it and I know these people and this island better than you. It should be me. 
SMITH I agree. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011         59. 
Lisa ushers O'Shea aside (leaving the others talking amongst themselves). 
LISA I see what you're doing here but have you forgotten you're a dependent alcoholic organising a piss up in a brewery! I'll do it. It'll be easier. 
O'SHEA Lisa, I'm good to no one when I drink. I know that. So do you.     I can do this. 
PADDY It's gonna rain any minute. 
Lisa looks at him, holding his stare.   O'Shea doesn't flinch. FINALLY -- 
LISA OK. But just so you know, I don't drink. I've never even been drunk. I don't know if I can. 
O'SHEA Of course you can. And you'll be the best drunken Guard this country's ever seen. You'll probably get promoted. 
LISA Ah stop. 
O'Shea smiles encouragingly. He takes out his flask and hands it to her. Suddenly he seems taller. 
SMITH Right, if we're doing this we'll need a blood test from a healthy subject. Lisa, you're the fittest person here. 
LISA (BLUSHES) You charmer. It's true, though. 
O'SHEA Brian, I want a table of everything Paddy had last night. 
BRIAN What night was last night? GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011           60. 
PADDY Saturday night. 
LISA Oh you gotta be joking me! 
PADDY Oh it was a big one. 
BRIAN Comin' right up. 
INT. MAHER'S PUB - DAY - LATER 
The table has six empties on it. Lisa sees double that though as she grips her seat for balance. 
The patrol jeep parks at the chapel. 
EXT. CHAPEL - DAY 
Brian, O'Shea and Lisa make their way towards the chapel doors. 
OMITTED 
OMITTED 
INT. CHAPEL - DAY 
FR POTTS, an incredulous elder statesman, finishes mass.    His eclectic congregation of forty or so ISLANDERS bless themselves -- FISHERMEN, HOUSEWIVES, OAPs, Una, etc. 
FR POTTS Mass has ended, go in peace to love and serve the Lord. Amen. 
O'Shea, Brian and Lisa enter the back of the chapel. 
O'SHEA Is this everyone? 
BRIAN It's Fr Potts last mass, so everyone that didn't leave yesterday for the thing in Dungary. 
O'Shea and Lisa walk up the aisle towards Fr Potts as people rise to leave, some chatting to each other as they go. 
O'SHEA Father, do you mind if I say a few words? 
FR POTTS Go mad. 
O'Shea takes to the pulpit. 
O'SHEA Can I have your attention please? 
The congregation looks up, considering O'Shea.   MAMIE, a grey haired granny, tuts to her neighbour. 
MAMIE Oh here we go. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011       64. 
O'SHEA Folks, just a quick announcement, at Maher's Tavern tonight we're having a bit of a shindig and you're all coming to join us for what will be a great night's craic! 
A wall of silence. 
UNA You're throwing a party? 
O'SHEA Yeah. 
UNA Why? 
O'SHEA Who needs a reason to have a laugh? 
Lisa gestures to O'Shea, still drunk but she'll field this one. 
LISA It's a welcome party for me. 
Lisa seems very proud of herself for coming up with that. 
UNA A welcome party? But you're leaving in a fortnight. 
LISA So it's a goodbye party.    Whatever. 
UNA You only just got here. 
LISA (TO O'SHEA) What's her problem? 
O'SHEA What we mean to say is -- 
A FISHERMAN rises to leave. 
LISA -- Hey bucko! Where are you going? This party's for your benefit. And all of you are gonna be there too. It's the law! GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011       65. 
LISA (CONT'D) And I swear to God I'll arrest any one of you who isn't. Chalk it down! 
Lisa glares at the congregation. 
FISHERMAN Are you coddin' us, love? 
LISA What's your name? 
He wilts. 
O'SHEA What Garda Nolan means is we'd love your company. There's no point going home to a cold, empty house in weather like tonight when we'll be right across the street from here and we'll have music and craic and company -- and a FREE BAR! 
BRIAN What?! 
HILDA, a stout woman, grabs her coat. 
HILDA Sold! 
O'SHEA That's the spirit! So c'mon, it's a party and the drinks are on us! 
O'Shea and Lisa drag the heavy table into position. 
OMITTED 
INT. PUB KITCHEN - NIGHT 
Finally Brian sets the wick in the nozzle of the super-soaker alight, pumps furiously and aims it out the door. 
BRIAN All right you ugly bollocks, have some of this shit! 
He takes squirts and ... nothing happens.   Except the gun tip melts and lights ablaze. 
BRIAN Ahh, Christ! 
The Grabber ROARS getting closer. 
O'SHEA That's gonna blow!   Get rid of it! 
Brian tosses the super-soaker outside and slams the door, double-bolting it, just in time as Una sways in, drink in hand, to find O'Shea, Lisa, Smith and Brian in a right state. 
UNA (SLURRED) What's goin' on? 
O'SHEA Nothing! 
BOOM! A bright flash of fire blossoms outside.   O'Shea barricades the door with furniture. 
UNA What was that? GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011      79. 
BRIAN What was what? 
Brian grabs a glass of wine. 
BRIAN Here, honey, have a drink. 
UNA I have a drink. 
BRIAN Have two. 
UNA I've drunk enough. 
O'SHEA Move back. 
THUD!    The door rattles. 
UNA (CALLS OUT) Who is it? 
BRIAN It's nobody, honey. 
LISA Who wants toast? 
SMITH I do. 
O'SHEA Is every one all right? 
LISA Grand. 
BLEURGH!    Smith vomits against the wall. 
UNA Mother of Jesus! 
POP!    Lisa's toast arrives.      She butters it. 
O'SHEA Is this what I'm like when I'm drunk? 
Lisa stares at him, chewing toast.       Eyes swimming. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011       80. 
LISA You're worse. 
O'Shea hustles every one out of the kitchen. 
INT. MAHER'S PUB - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 
O'Shea pushes through the oblivious patrons towards the bar. Brian flicks the taps. They hiss and sputter. 
BRIAN (TO O'SHEA) We're dry. 
PADDY We're what?! 
BRIAN Unless someone goes outside to change the kegs, we're done drinking for the night. 
Paddy's devastated. 
PADDY No!    NO! 
He thumps the counter. 
PADDY I was just gettin' a taste for it. 
Smith staggers out into the rain. 
SMITH It's raining again. 
O'Shea, Lisa and Paddy hang at the door, watching. 
O'SHEA Smith, listen to me. It's bigger than you think. Get back inside now! Please, I'm begging you. 
SMITH I need a picture with it. For National Geographic. And Facebook. 
PADDY Feck your photos, change the kegs! (OFF O'SHEA) What? He's flutered, sure he'll be fine. G'wan, Smith! Fine fella y'are! 
A GROWL in the darkness. A hint of movement in the blackest shadows. O'Shea pales. Smith raises his digital camera. 
O'SHEA Smith, mate! Listen to me! 
FLASH! He snaps a photo and The Grabber lights up for a split second, ten feet from Smith. 
SMITH Shush, you'll scare it. 
INTERCUT SMITH with THE PUB. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011               84. 
UNA Oh my God! 
FR POTTS What the fuck was that? 
PADDY A Grabber. 
FLASH!   Eight feet away from Smith.       And moving slowly. 
FLASH!   Five feet. 
FLASH!   Two. 
FLASH! The Grabber breaths on Smith, the air misting as its black lips unfurl back, revealing its pink bladed throat. 
SMITH Steady. You don't want to eat me. I'm ripped to the tits! 
Tentacles molest Smith, writhing all over him, mussing his hair. Licking and tasting his sweat. 
SMITH Sticky. 
The Grabber recoils, having tasted his sweat.       Yuck! 
SMITH (turns to others, grins) See! I told you. It's just an animal, it doesn't want to hur-- 
-- OOF! The Grabber flicks Smith out its way like a peanut, sending him shooting off into the night sky. 
Folks SCREAM and whimper.       Complete shock. 
PADDY He flew?! 
The Grabber charges straight for them.       O'Shea slams the door and turns, back flush against it -- 
O'SHEA Everyone, upstairs!      Now! 
The pub door collapses and JUMPERS flood in, breaching the fort. No doubt about it now, they're on a sinking ship. 
A stampede for the stairs. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011         85. 
INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 
Islanders clamber into the corridor, petrified. 
INT. STAIRWAY - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS (SAME LOCATION) 
O'Shea pulls a cabinet over, leaving obstacles in his wake. 
INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 
O'Shea and some others push furniture down the stairs, blocking access with a fortified wall of rubble. 
The upstairs hallway is jammed as Brian opens a door into an OLD DISUSED UPSTAIRS PUB, allowing people to filter in. The ruckus below sounding like a bar brawl. 
O'SHEA Everyone, stay calm.    They can't get up here. 
FR POTTS And what in the name of fuck were those things? 
PADDY Jumpers. 
FR POTTS Ha? 
PADDY They jump. 
THUD! CRASH! BANG! Islanders whimper.      O'Shea moves through the hallway, through the crowd. 
O'SHEA Has anyone been bitten? (no one has) You haven't been bitten because of the alcohol you've been drinking. They're allergic to drunk people. So there's no need to panic, we're safe up here. Has anyone got a mobile on them? 
THUD!    The Grabber ROARS and slithers off into the shadows. 
HILDA Oh, God.     What does it want? 
O'Shea looks at the scared Islanders. He's what it wants. The sound of WINDOWS SHATTERING. Islander's whimper. 
UNA It's not gonna stop, is it? We won't survive the night. We're on a sinking ship. 
Brian breathalyses himself sorrowfully. 
O'SHEA What's your reading? 
BRIAN Too drunk to drive a car but not drunk enough. We're sobering up. All of us. 
O'Shea nods tensely. 
Brian consoles Una as another loud THUD shakes the floor and the ceiling light shade above them. 
UNA We can't just sit here. It'll bring the walls down around us. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011   89. 
PADDY What if we threw a bomb at it? 
BRIAN Have you got semtex on you? 
PADDY Not on me, no. 
BRIAN How about we like push it off a cliff or something. 
UNA Or electrocute it?   I don't know. 
PADDY I vote we feed it Father Potts. Unless it eats shit it'll choke to death. 
FR POTTS I beg your pardon. 
Fr Potts perks up from the darker corner. 
PADDY Feck, is he in here? I was joking, Father. I apologise. 
Fr Potts disregards him. 
UNA If we can't destroy it, what can we do? 
O'SHEA (to Fr Potts) What about the phones? 
Fr Potts shakes his head.   Nothing. 
O'SHEA OK, we know it does two things: it drinks blood and it breathes water. We took away one, we could take away the other. 
UNA What do you mean? 
O'SHEA We need to keep it away from water. Dry it out somehow. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011         90. 
PADDY (re. the rain) Look outside. 
O'SHEA There's got to be some way we can stop it, fight fire with fire. 
Lisa notices her police boots from the day before, seeing the chalky stains all along them. An idea! 
LISA The Grabber! Not the Grabber- Grabber, the mechanical one! (off their confusion) The big yoke, with the arm and the thing and you know? That big aul whatchamacallit you crush things with. The feckin' thing at Cooney's site! What's it called? 
PADDY A Grabber? 
LISA Exactly! With that thing you could grab it, hoist it up and trap it. It's raining now but it has to stop some time right? And when it does it'd be stuck. Once the sun comes up it'd cook. That'd dry it out. 
O'Shea's eyes brighten, he smiles at Lisa.    She smiles back, properly proud of herself. 
PADDY You think you can catch that thing? 
UNA Sure 'tis lepping about all over the shop. 
BRIAN You'd need some sort of...? 
O'Shea clenches the leprechaun key-ring in his fist. 
O'SHEA -- A death trap. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011        91. 
INT. DISUSED PUB - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 
O'Shea moves to a window to clock a white PICKUP TRUCK parked outside in the rain. His purposeful stride instilling confidence in the others. O'Shea's back in charge. 
O'SHEA (TO BRIAN) Have you got the keys to your truck? 
Brian checks his pockets. 
BRIAN They'd be in the kitchen.     On the table, I think. 
O'SHEA I need them. 
O'SHEA I know. 
LISA What are we gonna do now? 
O'SHEA Fuck knows. 
O'Shea takes out and checks the flare gun. Two cartridges. He looks around him, looking for ideas. He sees something -- GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011          99. 
O'SHEA I've got an idea. 
Lisa clocks something, too.   On the other side of them. 
LISA I've got an idea too. 
O'SHEA What's your idea? 
LISA Why, what are you thinking? 
O'SHEA I'M THINKING-- 
The Grabber lurches forward sounding the starter pistol and storms towards them. 
LISA (at the Grabber) Wait! We're not ready! 
O'SHEA Run! 
LISA Give me the keys! 
O'Shea tosses Cooney's leprechaun key-chain at Lisa. She reaches to catch it but it sails past her drunken hands. 
LISA Got 'em.   Shit! 
Lisa staggers after the keys and snatches them off the footprints she left in the cement, now dry and rock hard. 
LISA Got 'em! 
O'Shea runs the incline of the ramp, gunning for the pit. 
INT./EXT. BULLDOZER - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 
Lisa slams into the bulldozer and stabs Cooney's keys into the driver's door but they won't open. They're -- 
LISA -- the wrong keys. It won't open. (SPOTS SOMETHING) GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011          100. 
She grabs a 2x4 off the ground and smashes the cabin's window. She climbs inside, grabs a screwdriver off a toolbox and sets to work jacking the ignition. 
LISA ... Breaking and entering.   Jacking a stolen vehicle ... 
INT. DERELICT SITE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 
O'Shea finds the pit as the Grabber follows him, ROARING. He darts across the metal ladder laid over the pit like a rickety bridge. The concrete hole waiting to swallow him up. 
The Grabber edges towards the pit, snarling.     It reaches the edge and stalls, feeling its surroundings. 
O'Shea is almost at the other side of the ladder when the Grabber snatches hold of it and yanks it away from under him. 
O'Shea just makes the safety of the rim giving him a foothold with a twenty foot drop onto shards of broken barrels and iron girders beyond that. If he slips he's dead. 
The Grabber considers him, edging no further. O'Shea sees the oil tanks, he aims the flare gun at the drums. Finger on the trigger, ready and waiting. 
O'SHEA Come on, you langer. Just a little closer. Move. Hey, you want me, you're going have to come across and get -- 
-- WHIPAH! The Grabber's barbed tongue shoots across the pit and lances the air around him. O'Shea's well within reach. 
O'SHEA Awwwwww bollocks. 
WHIPAH! O'Shea jumps left. WHIPAH! He jumps right. Inches to spare each time as O'Shea tries to take aim while ducking. 
He fires and the flare misses the oil drum. It strikes an exposed girder and lands in the pit, glowing and smouldering. 
He ducks the tongue and reloads, balanced precariously. 
INT./EXT. BULLDOZER - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 
Lisa jacks the screwdriver into the ignition and turns. The ENGINE rumbles to life along with the radio. She moves to put on her seat-belt but stops herself. Feck it. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011            101. 
She flips the lights on, full beam. Releases the hand-brake. Steels herself and slams the foot down, switching gears. All the while absentmindedly mumbling along to the radio. 
Treads spin, spitting mud.   Here she comes... 
INT. PIT - NIGHT 
WHIPAH!   The tongue lashes out and O'Shea ducks it. 
O'SHEA Enough!   Piss off! 
WHIPAH! The tongue strikes again but this one lances O'Shea's shoulder and spins him like a top! O'Shea smacks off the pit's floor, just missing an iron girder. Ouch!

Written By

Adapted from the Novel by 
Stephenie Meyer 
Dec. 21, 2008 
CREDITS OVER: 
A FULL MOON FILLS THE FRAME -- Luminous, tinged with gold. Slowly, a penumbral shadow begins to spread across the moon's surface, darkening it from left to right... 
BELLA (V.O.) "These violent delights have violent ends..." 
... until the moon is enveloped in shadow; a new moon... which disappears into the darkness. 
OVER BLACK - A RUFFLED TULIP appears, isolated against the blackness. BELLA (V.O.) "... And in their triumph die, like fire and powder..." 
HOLD ON the tulip as the background FADES UP around it to reveal we're now in -- 
EXT. FOREST - ECU ON THE TULIP - DAY 
It's surrounded by the dark, lush, greenery of the forest floor. 
BELLA (V.O.) "... Which, as they kiss, consume..." 
SUDDENLY A FOOT SLAMS DOWN next to the tulip, nearly crushing it. As the foot immediately lifts off again, it grazes the tulip, knocking its petals off -- 
ON THE RUNNING PAIR OF FEET They abruptly change direction. Race on. INCLUDE BELLA SWAN, desperately searching the woods -- SHORT, SURREAL CUTS of her frenetic quest -- 
BELLA Edward! 
Ahead, through the darkness of the thick forest, she SEES SUNLIGHT; a clearing. She hurtles toward it -- 
EXT. MEADOW - DAY 
BELLA Edward! 
-- as Bella bursts into the sunlight. It's the meadow where Edward revealed his skin in the sun. But he's not here now. Instead, Bella SEES -- 
ACROSS THE MEADOW -- AN OLD WOMAN, white hair framing her withered face. Bella's eyes widen with surprise as she recognizes -- 
BELLA ... Gran? 
GRAN looks as surprised as Bella. Bella smiles and waves, as does Gran. Bella starts toward her but -- 
EDWARD (O.S.) Bella... She spins to the voice behind her to SEE -- 
EDWARD emerge from the forest, his alabaster skin in sharp contrast to the shadows. She beams at him, relieved, in love... until he moves to edge of the shade, inches from sun's rays -- 
BELLA Stop - she'll see! 
But Edward just smiles and steps into the sunlight. Sunbeams SHATTER off his skin like a thousand rainbow shards, as if he were made of diamonds. An awesome sight. 
JUMP CUT TO: Edward now inches from Bella, still glistening, entrancing her. She wraps an arm around his waist, then arranges her face into a calm expression. They turn to -- 
Gran, whose expression is calm, too. Gran's arm is extended, as if she also holds someone. JUMP CUT TO: Bella and Edward, only feet from Gran now. Bella's about to present Edward, but then SEES that -- 
Gran mimics Bella's movement exactly. With growing horror, Bella reaches out to Gran... and touches glass! 
PULL BACK TO FIND Gran is now surrounded by a GILDED FRAME. It's a MIRROR, mounted on a wall with wallpaper reflecting a surreal dreamlike version of the forest behind Bella. 
BELLA Oh my God. 
-- as she realizes that's not Gran; it's Bella, sixty-five years older. 
Bella spins to her perfect, eternally 17-year-old Edward. He takes her now WRINKLED, age-spotted hand. Kisses it. 
Then he leans in very close to her 83-YEAR-OLD FACE and whispers into her ear -- 
EDWARD Happy birthday. 
SMASH TO: 
INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - MORNING 
ON BELLA - her eyes snap open. She lies atop her bed. A book, "ROMEO AND JULIET," lays open on her chest. Bella sits up, the dream still weighing on her... INCLUDE HER ROOM, cluttered with pictures of Edward, of the Cullens; memorabilia of all things Edward. A KNOCK on the door. CHIEF CHARLIE SWAN enters carrying two gifts, one wrapped, one not. 
CHARLIE Happy birthday, Bells. 
BELLA Dad, we agreed, no gifts. 
CHARLIE At least mine's not wrapped. 
BELLA Right.   Class. 
Catching their breath, they start toward school... but Edward stops, hearing something in his mind. Irritated. 
EDWARD Someone wants you. 
JACOB (O.S.) Bella! JACOB BLACK, 16, jogs up, carrying a used car part, long, black ponytail wagging. He looks 18 due to his tall, muscular body, but the gregarious Jacob is a little klutzy, still catching up to his growth spurt. He nods to Edward, who moves off to the side but eyes them. 
BELLA God, Jacob, what are they feeding you on that rez, steroids? You're huge. 
JACOB Wouldn't seem so drastic if you came around more. 
BELLA I will, soon. But isn't your school, like, ten miles that way? 
JACOB (re: car part) Just here buying this for the Rabbit. I'm almost done with the rebuild. Gotta come take a ride when it's done. (as if remembering) Oh, and hey, happy birthday. Your dad told my dad. So... 
He pulls from his coat a small woven DREAMCATCHER, feathers dangling from it. He hands it to her. JACOB I saw it the other day and thought of you - it catches bad dreams. 
BELLA This, I need. It's great. 
EDWARD The bell's about to ring. 
The bell RINGS. Jacob gives Edward an amiable smile, with just a hint of snark. 
JACOB Ooh, look at you, all psychic. 
EDWARD I don't have that particular gift. But I can read a watch. I'm clever that way. 
They share a tight smile.   Bella intercedes, squeezing Jacob's arm. 
BELLA Bye, Jake, and thank you. 
Edward guides her away.   As they walk off -- 
EDWARD How come Jacob Black gets to give you a gift and I don't? 
BELLA He's just a friend. 
EDWARD "Friends" don't spend two weeks looking for the perfect dreamcatcher. 
BELLA Stop reading his mind if he bothers you so much. 
EDWARD Little hard to tune out. 
She just laughs, but Edward looks back at Jacob with resentment. Jacob holds his gaze. 
INT. FORKS HIGH SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - DAY Edward and Bella enter the double doors -- suddenly a small, wrapped gift appears in Bella's face. ALICE presents it. 
ALICE Happy -- 
BELLA Shh! 
-- Alice whispers in her ear as she hugs Bella -- 
ALICE -- birthday. 
Over Alice's shoulder, Bella sees JASPER, keeping his distance. He offers her a pleasant nod. She tries to hide Alice's present, hoping no one noticed -- 
BELLA Alice, didn't I say no gifts? 
ALICE You did. I didn't. I've already seen you open it and guess what? You love it. 
BELLA You had a vision about my birthday. 
ALICE And about the green dress you'll be wearing to your party tonight. Great color on you. 
BELLA ... My party? 
ALICE Please?     It'll be fun. 
BELLA (beat, confused) I... guess I can deal -- 
ALICE (hurriedly) -- Great! See ya at seven! 
Alice hugs her again and races off before she can change her mind. Which is when Bella realizes -- 
BELLA Wait, Jasper, no fair with the mood control. 
He offers an apologetic bow before Alice drags him away. 
EDWARD Vampires.    You can't trust them. 
CUT TO: 
CLOSE ON A T.V. MONITOR - Zeffirelli's `68 "Romeo and Juliet" plays. The suicide scene. 
ROMEO Arms, take your last embrace, and lips, O you, the doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss... 
BELLA Stop.   I don't want normal, I want you. 
Edward doesn't respond, just pulls the truck into -- 
EXT. BELLA'S HOUSE/INT. BELLA'S TRUCK (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT 
The truck stops.   Beat. 
BELLA You can't protect me from everything - something's going to separate us -- accident, illness, old age... as long as I'm human... EDWARD (appalled) That's your solution?   My ending your life? 
BELLA Your giving me forever. 
He faces forward again, jaw tight, mind working, tormented. She reaches for his hand -- 
BELLA Carlisle told me how you feel, about my soul, but I don't believe that -- 
-- he subtly moves his hand away from hers. 
EDWARD You should go in. It's late. 
He climbs out - instantly he's opening the passenger side door for her. She climbs out. He looks down at her face - he softens as he takes it in. Puts a hand on her cheek. 
BELLA I'll leave my window open for you. 
EDWARD (quietly) I won't be coming back.   Not tonight. 
BELLA Then... can I ask for one thing?   It's still my birthday. (off his nod) Kiss me? 
He lifts her face to his, and kisses her. He begins carefully, gently... but it changes, he becomes urgent, with an almost painful edge, as if it were goodbye. 
Abruptly, he pulls away. With a last look, he turns walks off into the night. Off Bella... 
INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
ON A PHOTO - as a printer spits it out. It's the pic Alice took of Bella and Edward's embrace. Bella, troubled, puts it in her scrapbook, her bandaged finger running over it. 
INT. HIGH SCHOOL - ENGLISH CLASS - DAY 
"Romeo and Juliet" lessons are on the board. Everyone's scribbling essays. Bella glances at Edward's desk; empty -- 
FLASHPOP TO -- (previous scene in truck) ECU ON EDWARD'S EYES, hard, turning away from her... 
INT. HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - DAY 
Bella sits with Jessica, Angela, Eric and Mike. They joke, throw things. Bella's distracted, looking-out for Edward. 
FLASHPOP TO -- (scene in the truck) ECU ON EDWARD'S HAND moving away from hers... 
BACK ON BELLA'S WORRIED FACE, off which we go to -- 
INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - DAY 
PAN the photos on the wall. INCLUDE EDWARD who studies them, his expression grim. He looks down at Bella's SCRAPBOOK to SEE the photo of him and Bella. He pulls it out, takes a closer look... EXT. BELLA'S HOUSE - DAY 
ON BELLA THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD of her truck as she pulls into the driveway. She climbs out, heads toward the house but stops, relief washing over her -- 
BELLA Edward.   You're here. 
He stands by the house. Bella hurries toward him, but slows when she sees his cold, distant face; an unreadable mask. 
EDWARD Walk with me? 
Edward gently takes her hand. Dread fills her, but she lets him guide her toward the woods... 
EXT. WOODS - DAY 
Edward stops by a fallen tree.        Turns to Bella. 
EDWARD We need to leave Forks. 
BELLA What?   Why? 
EDWARD It's time. Carlisle's supposed to be ten years older than he looks; people will start noticing. 
BELLA But... when? 
EDWARD Now. 
Bella reels, trying to take this in.       Finally -- 
BELLA I'll have to think of something to tell Charlie, but I can be ready -- 
EDWARD Not you.   Us. 
BELLA (stunned) What? -- no -- Edward, what happened with Jasper - that was nothing. EDWARD Nothing compared to what could happen. You don't belong in my world. 
BELLA -- I belong with you -- 
Harry puts a reassuring hand on Charlie's shoulder. 
HARRY CLEARWATER We'll find her, Charlie. 
Charlie is glad for the comfort of his two friends. 
JACOB Charlie! 
Charlie spins to where Jacob points -- 
THEIR POV - THE EDGE OF THE WOODS 
SAM ULEY, 20, emerges, a tall, strong Quileute Indian with cropped hair and a fierce expression. He's carrying Bella. 
BILLY It's Sam Uley. He found her. 
Charlie bolts to her; he's never moved faster in his life. He wraps his arms around Bella, lifting her from Sam's arms. 
CHARLIE Thank you, Sam. Thank God. 
Charlie carries Bella to the house, cradling her. Harry and Billy give Sam a nod of praise and gratitude. But Sam backs away, avoiding any accolades. 
ON JACOB - jogging alongside Charlie, peering at Bella with worry. Then Jacob slows, feeling eyes on his back... he turns to SEE Sam Uley staring at him. Jacob, uncomfortable, quickly looks away. 
ON CHARLIE CARRYING BELLA up the stairs to the house -- 
CHARLIE What were you thinking, Baby?   Why were you out there? 
BELLA He's... gone. 
Off her as Charlie carries her inside -- 
INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
OVERHEAD SHOT OF THE BED - Charlie lays Bella down and wraps her in blankets... A SERIES OF DISSOLVES ON BELLA 
She's curled in a fetal position in the middle of the bed. Then at its foot. Under the blankets. On top of them. In various different arrangements. Meanwhile... 
A BLACK LIQUID begins to flood the floor, slowly swallowing everything in the room. It rises up the sides of the bed, higher and higher until it breaches the top of the bed and begins to engulf Bella. Off her, submerged in blackness... 
EXT.   BELLA'S HOUSE - DAY - A MONTH LATER 
The leaves have turned red and orange.    SEE a FIGURE in the upstairs window -- 
INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - DAY 
Bella sits in a rocking chair by the window. Her face blank. Empty. STAY ON BELLA, unchanging - but THROUGH THE WINDOW OUTSIDE, we SEE TIME LAPSING behind her -- 
OCTOBER -- Costumed kids appear in the yard, trick-or- treating. DISSOLVE INTO... 
NOVEMBER -- NEIGHBORS (BOB MARKS and his WIFE) bring Charlie a turkey... they glance up at Bella's window with concern... WINTER BEGINS -- the trees' branches are now bare... 
DECEMBER -- Charlie drags a Christmas tree toward the house... worry has taken its toll on him. But Bella remains unchanged... 
BELLA (V.O.) Dear Mom... I'm... (beat) ... lost... 
PAN the now blank walls of the exceedingly neat room; gone are all traces of Edward... 
BELLA (V.O.) Edward took everything with him. Including my life. He promised it would be like he never existed... 
... LAND ON the scrapbook which lies open; the photo of Bella and Edward's embrace at the birthday party - gone. INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - ANOTHER DAY 
BELLA AT HER COMPUTER, typing an e-mail to Renee. 
BELLA (V.O.) ... But I need to know he did. 
A SERIES OF TABLEAUS, DISSOLVING INTO ONE ANOTHER: 
-- INT. BELLA'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Bella sits on the couch, blank, as the rain pounds.    Charlie watches her, concerned. 
BELLA (V.O.) It's like a huge hole has been punched through my chest... 
-- INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
In the darkness, Bella is curled up in a ball on her floor. 
BELLA (V.O.) But the pain is my only reminder that he was real... that they all were... 
-- INT. FORKS HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - DAY 
Lunch. Bella sits alone, staring straight ahead. SEE Jessica, Eric, Angela and Mike, watching her with concern. Talking about her. She doesn't notice. 
BELLA (V.O.) I miss them. Especially Alice... 
EXT. TANYA'S ALASKAN HOME - DAY 
CHARLIE You're going to Jacksonville to live with your mother. BELLA What?   Why? 
CHARLIE I just - don't know what to do any more. You don't act like someone left you; more like someone died. 
She looks away.   That's how it feels to her. 
BELLA I'm not leaving Forks. 
CHARLIE Bells, the bastard's not coming back. 
She nods.   Knows this all too well. 
CHARLIE It's not normal, this behavior. And frankly, it's scaring the hell outta me, and your mother. (gentler) Go to Jacksonville, Baby. Make some new friends. 
BELLA I like my old friends. 
CHARLIE You never even see them anymore. 
BELLA I do, too. In fact, I'm... um... Jessica and I are going to Port Angeles tomorrow. Shopping. 
CHARLIE (suspicious) You hate shopping. 
BELLA That's how good a friend I am. 
CHARLIE (somewhat appeased) Alright. Shopping. 
BELLA (PRE-LAP) Hi Jessica, it's Bella... 
INT. BELLA'S TRUCK - DAY Bella drives, talking on her cell (hands-free, of course). 
BELLA ... Yes, Bella Swan. Hey, any chance you feel like shopping tomorrow? 
EXT. PORT ANGELES - MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT 
Bella and Jessica exit the theater.   A MARQUEE behind them bears the title of a ZOMBIE film. 
BELLA I don't get why are there so many zombie movies. 
JESSICA It's, like, a metaphor? For crass consumerism or something. 
Bella glances at her. 
JESSICA Not that you'd know anything about consuming. You didn't buy anything today. 
BELLA I bought something. 
JESSICA Socks don't count. `Course, I was surprised you even called. 
BELLA I've been kind of... out of it. 
JESSICA Kind of? I mean, at first I was worried. Then I'm like, okay, she's still bumming? It's not like I wasn't going through things, too. Like Mike deciding he wanted to "just be friends?" That was really hard and -- 
MAN'S VOICE (O.S.) How `bout a ride, girls? 
As Bella looks ACROSS THE STREET, time suddenly SLOWS -- 
BELLA'S POV - A DIVE BAR, "ONE EYED PETE'S" (SLOW MOTION) 
-- FOUR ROUGH-LOOKING GUYS loiter out front next to their motorcycles. They're in shadow, we can't see their faces. 
OFF BELLA WE SMASH TO -- 
FLASHPOPS: Bella surrounded by FOUR GUYS ("Twilight"); Edward's Volvo skidding to a stop; Edward staring them down -- 
BACK ON BELLA, a chill going down her spine, FREEZING her as she stares at the foursome across the street... 
Then suddenly -- a pair of lips lean next to her ear -- 
EDWARD (O.S.) Move, Bella. 
She turns to find Edward standing next to her. Or so it seems. But he's an illusion; an apparition - which becomes clear when -- 
Jessica steps right into him, dissolving him to nothingness, and TIME ABRUPTLY SPEEDS UP AGAIN -- JESSICA Come on. 
BELLA I know them... I think... 
JESSICA Can we just go -- 
Jessica pulls at her arm, but Bella shakes her off. 
BELLA I want to see something. 
Much to Jessica's frustration, Bella begins to cross the street toward the Guys, frightened but drawn. 
GUY #1 Alright, we got a taker. 
The apparition of EDWARD REAPPEARS in her path this time. She stops. 
BELLA I really get it if you think this is stupid and reckless. JACOB Oh it's totally stupid and reckless. (leans closer, grins) When do we start? 
Bella face spreads into something we haven't seen in a while... a wide smile. As they pull the bikes off the truck, they laugh and joke; it's as though Jacob has brought Bella back to life. But -- 
UNKNOWN POV - ON BELLA AND JACOB FROM A DISTANCE 
-- someone's watching as the two of them wheel the bikes into the garage. REVERSE on the watcher to discover -- 
EXT. EDGE OF THE WOODS - SAM ULEY - SAME 
Next to Sam stand two others, JARED, 17, and PAUL, 18. All three have cropped hair, sleeveless shirts, cut-offs. It's unsettling how they watch Bella and Jacob; the ferocity in their eyes, the danger. Sam turns; the others follow his lead. The three slink soundlessly into the darkness of the woods... 
SMASH TO: 
EXT. FOREST - DAY 
Two hikers, NATE and TIM, 20's, as they tromp through the shadowy, mist-laden woods. Tim studies his IPhone GPS -- 
TIM We're going the wrong way. 
NATE Who cares?   Enjoy the scenery. 
TIM (slapping a mosquito) And the West Nile virus. 
Tim hears a RUSTLE.    Stops. 
TIM You hear that? 
NATE If I knew you were such a wuss, I'd have brought my grandma. 
TIM Could be one of those giant bears. NATE There are no giant -- 
RUSTLE. Nate stops. Then, from the opposite direction, another RUSTLE. Then another, and another, from behind, from in front. It's either more than one creature or it's moving with extraordinary speed. The guys are terrified. 
TIM What the hell is that?! 
NATE I don't know! 
The guys, faced away from one another, search the trees. STAY ON TIM as suddenly, there's an eerie SILENCE. Beat. 
TIM Think it's gone? 
No answer.   He turns to find that Nate has vanished. TIM Nate?   Nate!? 
Nothing... then the RUSTLING starts again.       And intensifies. 
Tim BOLTS! CLOSE ON TIM - tearing through the woods, too scared to feel the branches SMACK him in the face. Breath ragged, he looks over his shoulder -- 
TIM'S POV - BEHIND HIM - something gives chase, flattening foliage and bending thin trees in its path. Tim runs harder -- 
TIM'S POV - UP AHEAD THROUGH THE TREES - THE HIGHWAY 
A couple cars pass.    Civilization.   Safety.   Tim races for it -- 
EXT. HIGHWAY (CONTINUOUS) 
Tim bursts from the tree-line, he's almost to the pavement, he`s going to escape -- 
BAM! Something YANKS him out of frame at an unnatural angle. His SCREAM is abruptly choked off, leaving nothing but a disturbing silence... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. JACOB'S GARAGE - ANOTHER DAY 
Motorcycle parts are spread out on blankets.    Jacob moves among them excitedly, piecing them together.    Bella watches. BELLA If we're going to be working on this every day, we should probably include some homework. Don't want the Dads to think I'm a bad influence on you. 
JACOB You influence me?     Please. 
BELLA I am older than you. 
JACOB Age ain't nothin' but a number. 
BELLA And I convinced you to secretly build us two-wheeled death machines. 
JACOB (sudden mock-horror) God, you're right, you're like Satan -- QUIL (O.S.) Yo, Jake, you in there? 
Bella abruptly sits up, starts to pull a tarp over the bikes. 
JACOB It's cool, it's just my boys. 
QUIL ATEARA and EMBRY CALL enter, both 16. Quil is short, stocky and feisty, with short hair. Embry is tall, thin and laid back, with chin-length black hair. 
EMBRY Hey, Jake -- 
They stop when they see Bella.        The two guys share a smile. 
JACOB Hey. This is Bella.         Bella, that's Quil and Embry. 
INT. BELLA'S TRUCK - DAY 
Bella drives along the La Push cliffs. Jacob rides shotgun. He studies a grease-blackened motorcycle crankshaft. 
JACOB We got lucky at the dump. You know how much a new crankshaft goes for? 
BELLA Sure, I spend all my free time on crankshaft-dot-com. 
JACOB I think that's a porn site. (then) These bikes are gonna be rolling soon. Where should we ride first? 
BELLA Someplace sunny. 
JACOB Like there's any place sunny around here. 
BELLA I know a place above the cloud line -- 
The second she says it, she regrets it -- off her -- 
FLASHPOP TO - THE MEADOW, Bella lying in the grass with Edward ("Twilight"), flowers surrounding them. 
JACOB (O.S.) Where is it? 
BACK ON BELLA - her face falls. BELLA Actually, it's... too hard to get to. 
He brings his easy smile and optimism to the rescue. 
JACOB So we'll find our sunny spot, right? 
She smiles, grateful. Then she looks out the window at the cliffs... and notices -- 
BELLA'S POV - IN THE DISTANCE BY THE CLIFF 
FOUR MEN stand on the rocky ledge of the cliff (Sam, Jared, Paul, and a fourth). They wear nothing but cut-off shorts. They push each other, rough-housing. 
BELLA Isn't that... Sam Uley? 
JACOB (bitter) And his cult. 
Suddenly, two of the guys throw a struggling Jared over the cliff! BELLA SLAMS on the brakes. Jumps out of the truck -- Jacob climbs out after her -- BELLA Oh my God!   Stop them! -- 
EXT. LA PUSH CLIFFS (CONTINUOUS) - DAY 
-- Bella runs toward them.   But Jacob's laughter slows her. 
JACOB They're not really fighting, Bella. They're cliff diving. 
BELLA What, on purpose? 
JACOB Scary as hell, but a total rush. 
BELLA'S POV - A DIVER (Paul) takes a running start and FLINGS himself into the air, twisting and cartwheeling down. 
Bella is intrigued, sees the potential for adrenaline - for Edward. 
JACOB Most of us jump from lower down. 
BELLA Think I could? 
JACOB Man, first motorcycles, now cliff diving? 
BELLA You said it was a rush. 
JACOB Maybe on a warmer day. And not from the top. We'll leave the showing off to Sam and his disciples. 
There's that bitter edge again.   She looks at him. 
BELLA You don't like them. 
JACOB They think they run this place.   Acting all bad ass, calling themselves "protectors." 
BELLA What are they protecting? 
JACOB The tribe, the land, their right to be jerks. Embry used to call them hall monitors on steroids; now look at him. 
Bella looks closer, SEES the fourth guy is Embry, hair now shorn, thin frame filled out, laid back expression gone. It pains Jacob to see him. 
BELLA That's Embry? I didn't recognize him. What happened to him? 
JACOB He missed some school - then, out of nowhere, he's following Sam around. Same thing happened with Paul and Jared. They weren't even friends, now Sam owns them. (beat) Sam keeps giving me this look, like he's waiting for me or something; it's kinda freaking me out. 
BELLA Maybe you should just avoid them. 
JACOB I try but... 
She sees he's unnerved, instinctively hugs him reassuringly. 
BELLA Hey.   If it gets worse, we'll go to my Dad.   Or you can come stay with us. 
Jacob races toward her. She reaches the turn, doesn't bank, goes straight... and flies right into a wall of trees. 
As she lies on the ground dazed, Jacob hurries up. 
JACOB What, are you training for the X-games? 
She looks around for Edward.   He's gone. 
BELLA I want to go again. 
JACOB Forget it. I'm revoking your motorcycle privileges. Man, look at your head. 
Indeed, blood drips down her forehead. He pulls off his shirt to mop it up. She shrinks away -- 
BELLA God, I'm sorry. JACOB You're apologizing for bleeding? 
BELLA It doesn't... bother you? 
JACOB It's just blood, Bella. 
He bends over her, carefully tending her head. She finds herself looking at him. His dark eyes, his bare chest and smooth skin. He glances at her. 
JACOB What are you staring at? 
BELLA Just, you're actually... good looking. 
He's surprised; there's a moment between them.     He smiles. 
JACOB How hard did you hit your head? 
BELLA (realizing) Oh I - yeah. 
He offers her a hand, helps her up.    She holds onto it, alarmed. 
BELLA Jake, you're hot. 
JACOB Upgraded from good looking? 
BELLA No, temperature hot. (feels his forehead) You're burning up. 
JACOB I feel fine. 
He takes her hand from his forehead.   Holds it.   She tries to pull it away. 
JACOB What?   I can't hold your hand? BELLA It just... means something else to you than it does to me. 
JACOB One, that's my problem. But two... we have fun, you think I'm hot -- 
BELLA Good looking. 
JACOB I know you like me. 
BELLA More than anyone.    But... that's all. 
JACOB Because of Cullen? 
The name stings her.   He takes both her hands now. 
JACOB Look, I know what he did to you. I can see it in your face every time his name comes up. But you need to know - I would never, ever do that to you. I promise I will never hurt you. You can count on me. BELLA I already do. You don't know how much. You're my best friend but... I don't think my feelings will change. 
He takes this in, it's hard. A wave of something sweeps over him. He sits back. Closes his eyes, takes a breath. 
BELLA I'm sorry. I should've said something right from the start -- 
JACOB No. That's not -- I just feel... weird. 
BELLA I told you, you have a fever. Probably that flu everyone has. 
JACOB It doesn't... feel like flu.    I don't know what it is. 
Off Jacob, rattled, and Bella, concerned... 
INT. BELLA'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - ANOTHER DAY 
Bella does homework. Charlie watches a game.     She's on edge. Anxious. HEAR A BEEEEP -- 
BELLA (O.S.) Hey Jake. Just checking to see how you're doing. And to say I'm sorry, about, you know... how I feel and... hope the flu passes fast. Call me. 
EXT. FORKS HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - ANOTHER DAY 
Bella climbs out of her truck, SEES the empty spot where Edward used to park. SEES Eric and Angela canoodling. Couples everywhere. She puts her head down, hurries to class. BEEEEP -- 
BELLA (O.S.) Hi Jake. Your dad said you have mono. He won't let me visit but... would you call me? 
INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Bella paces her room, not wanting to sleep/dream.     She eyes the phone, waiting for it to ring. BEEEEP -- BELLA (O.S.) Me again.   I just... need to hear your voice... 
Suddenly, he's standing inches from her.   She now sees his EYES. Dark blood-red. 
LAURENT (conspiratorial) Tell me Bella. Do you ever feel compelled to... cheat? 
Bella involuntarily takes a step away from him. 
LAURENT But that's not why I left. I came back here as a favor to Victoria. 
BELLA ... You're still friends. 
LAURENT (shrugs) More or less. She asked me to get the lay of the land with the Cullens. Because, well... I'm afraid Victoria is quite put out with you. 
BELLA That's... too bad. 
LAURENT Yes. She feels it's only fair to kill Edward's mate, given he killed hers. Eye for an eye, mate for a mate. 
And now Bella knows.   Terror overwhelms her.   Edward appears -- 
EDWARD Threaten him. 
BELLA Edward will know who did it.   He'll come after both of you. 
LAURENT I don't think he will. After all, how much could you mean to him if he left you here unprotected? (then) Victoria sent me here for information. She won't be happy about my killing you. BELLA No, Laurent... 
LAURENT (sincere) No, no, no. Don't be upset. I'm doing you a kindness. Victoria plans on killing you slowly, painfully - whereas I'll make it very quick. (inhaling) And you smell so... mouth watering. 
He faces her, taking in her scent, bloodlust building.   Her eyes dart around, escape is impossible -- 
The only thing she SEES is the apparition of Edward, looking at her with alarm... 
BELLA (whispering, barely audible) Edward. I love you. Laurent is milliseconds from biting - then abruptly, his expression changes. He sees something in the forest behind Bella - and it terrifies him. 
LAURENT I... don't believe it. 
He steps back. Bella's confused as she realizes he's no longer focused on her... she follows his eyes, slowly turning... to find behind her -- 
AN ENORMOUS BLACK WOLF skulking out of the darkness of the woods. It stalks towards them, a low disturbing GROWL in its throat, sharp teeth gleaming. 
Bella is trapped between the two killers.    Edward whispers in her ear -- 
EDWARD Don't.   Move. 
The wolf slinks closer to Bella, a mere twenty feet from where she stands, then -- 
FOUR MORE WOLVES soundlessly emerge from the trees, flanking the black wolf. They're the size of small horses, all of different hues: dark silver, chocolate, ash and russet- brown. Their hackles are up, lips curling, bodies crouched, ready to spring. 
Bella is frozen with fear as they come toward her. The RUSSET- BROWN WOLF is the closest and looks directly at her. Laurent continues to retreat - then suddenly, almost simultaneously -- 
-- Laurent BOLTS across the meadow -- 
-- The wolves SPRING toward Bella -- and leap right over her in pursuit of Laurent! Their thunderous SNARLS and SNAPS shake her as the pack sprint after the vampire, surrounding him before he reaches the treeline -- 
Laurent SWINGS at the dark silver wolf, SMACKING the wolf half-way across the meadow. Another wolf lunges at Laurent - he kicks it and it sails into a tree, SPLINTERING it. 
The two wolves recover, lurch back to the pack which closes in on Laurent. It's impossible to know who will prevail -- 
Bella doesn't stay to find out.     She RACES into the woods -- 
EXT. WOODS (CONTINUOUS) - DAY 
-- Bella runs franticly, tearing down the hillside, tripping, quickly picking herself up -- running, running -- 
EXT. WOODS/ROADSIDE - DAY 
-- Bella DASHES out of the treeline and to her truck parked on the shoulder. She jumps in, PEALS out -- 
INT. BELLA'S HOUSE - DAY 
Bella BURSTS in, out of breath. Charlie and Harry Clearwater are washing their fishing gear. Charlie spins. 
CHARLIE Bella?   What's wrong? 
BELLA They're not giant bears -- I saw them. Up in a meadow -- 
CHARLIE Damn it, I told you not to go into the woods! 
HARRY CLEARWATER What did you see, Bella? 
BELLA Wolves.   They're wolves, Dad. 
We might note, though they don't, that Harry Clearwater sighs ever-so-slightly. BELLA Five of them. The size of - of cars. I swear. They went after -- something - - and I ran. 
Charlie grabs up the phone; as he dials -- 
CHARLIE Harry, can you get some men from the rez? 
HARRY CLEARWATER Sure.   Yeah. I'll just -- 
JACOB I can't be friends with you anymore. BELLA Jake, I know I hurt you. I should have been more up-front but -- I needed you, I still do. I don't know what that means yet, but if you give me time -- 
JACOB Stop.    Don't. It's not you -- 
BELLA -- "It's not you, it's me?"     God. 
JACOB It's true.   I'm not... good. 
BELLA You're wrong -- 
JACOB It doesn't matter.    This is over -- BELLA I can't take losing my best friend, too. 
JACOB You already have -- 
BELLA Don't say that -- you promised -- 
JACOB Go home, Bella. Don't come back. 
He practically runs away, joining the gang who all disappear inside. Off Bella, standing in the rain... 
INT. BELLA'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Bella enters, dripping wet, too listless to close the door. Charlie's face falls when he sees the pain and lifelessness returned to her. He grabs a blanket, wraps her in it. 
CHARLIE Billy called, said you and Jacob had a fight. But, hey, you guys will work it out, I'm sure of it. 
BELLA I'm... going to change. 
Bella heads upstairs.   Charlie sags, helpless.   He moves to the open door -- UNKNOWN POV - EXT. BELLA'S HOUSE (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT 
-- It paces, watching Charlie slowly close the door... 
SMASH TO: 
INT. FOREST - NIGHT 
Bella TEARS through the forest again, searching. She turns -- finds Edward, cold, distant. But his face begins to MORPH... 
... and becomes Jacob's. She reaches for him but he BOLTS backward, suddenly many yards away. 
BELLA Why!? 
He, too, retreats further, disappearing until Bella is alone. 
BLACKNESS encroaches, the moonlight becoming a tiny spotlight on her. She searches the dark - then SEES a pair of EYES, female, blood-red - coming toward her; HEAR a loud SCREECHING NOISE -- 
INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
-- Bella tosses herself awake, slowly realizing it was just a dream. But she HEARS the SCREECHING noise again! Fingernails on her window. Bella bolts upright, looks around for a weapon -- 
JACOB (O.S.) (whisper shouting) Bella! Ouch - damn it; open the window. 
Bella cautiously moves to her window to find -- 
EXT. BELLA'S HOUSE (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT 
Jacob, shirtless, clings to the top of a tree which bends with his weight. Bella opens the window, whisper-yelling -- 
BELLA What the hell are you doing? 
JACOB Get out of the way. 
He begins to swing his legs, increasing momentum.       She realizes what he's about to attempt -- 
BELLA No! He launches himself THROUGH the window with great agility -- 
INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT 
-- Jacob lands on the balls of his feet. Bella is stunned. He freezes, listening for Charlie. Nothing. A bitter, self- satisfied grin spreads on his face. It pisses Bella off. He takes in her room. 
JACOB I pictured your room more... cluttered. 
BELLA Why are you here? 
JACOB I had to talk to you.   Alone. 
BELLA To kick me in the gut again? It was bad before, but you made it so much worse. 
JACOB I know. And I want to explain. But... I can't. 
BELLA Then leave. 
He stays put.   She tries to push him but he's immoveable. 
BELLA You're done with me, remember?   Get. Out! 
JACOB Bella, I literally can't explain... 
Paul and Jacob are beyond hearing. 
PAUL All you care about is her -- SAM (commanding) Paul, back off. 
PAUL -- and she doesn't give a crap about you -- 
Jacob flashes anger, PUSHES Paul, hard.   Paul FLIES backward. 
SAM Jacob. 
Paul rises, outraged, throws his head back in a growl, vibrating violently -- 
JARED Too late. 
SAM Bella, get back! Paul FALLS FORWARD but halfway to the ground there's a loud RIPPING noise and Paul explodes in silver-gray fur, becoming a massive wolf crouched and ready to spring! 
Bella, horrified, grabs Jacob's arm, pulling him -- 
BELLA Run, Jacob! -- 
But he yanks away from her, runs directly at the Paul-wolf -- 
BELLA Jake, no!   Stop -- ! 
Jacob DIVES headfirst into the air - with another sharp TEARING sound, shreds of cloth blast into the air, fur BURSTS from Jacob's skin - he lands on the ground a gigantic russet-brown wolf, charging the Paul-wolf. 
Bella reels as the two wolves CRASH into each other, snarling and RAMMING one another. The sound is DEAFENING. Their teeth flash at each other's throats. 
Bella stumbles backward as the fight carries the two wolves beyond the clearing and into the woods -- 
CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM, as they fight deeper and deeper into the darkness... until they disappear. The horrible SOUNDS of the fight still ECHO -- BACK IN THE CLEARING -- Sam starts after them, kicking off his shoes. 
SAM Take Bella to Emily's place. 
Sam disappears leaving an eerie quiet.    A long silence... 
EMBRY Guess the wolf's out of the bag. 
Off Bella, stunned. 
EXT. LA PUSH - EMILY'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Bella's truck, driven by Embry, pulls up to a tiny, weathered house with a window box full of marigolds. Jared, in the back, jumps out, opens Bella's door. He and Embry head toward the house. She doesn't move. 
EMBRY (to Jared) Pay up. She didn't puke. 
Jared, annoyed, hands Embry five bucks. 
EMBRY Told you she was tough.     She does run with bloodsuckers. 
BELLA Wait. We should go back, make sure Jacob's okay. 
JARED I hope Paul gets some teeth in him. Serve him right. 
EMBRY No way. Jake's a natural. You see him phase on the fly? I gotta fiver says Paul doesn't touch him. 
JARED Easy money.    Paul's been at it longer. 
Bella looks at them, appalled.      They realize she's not following them. 
EMBRY Come on in.    We won't bite. 
JARED Speak for yourself. Bella warily climbs out of the car, joins them.     Embry pauses at the door -- 
EMBRY Oh, hey, about Emily - Sam's fiance - just try not to stare. It bugs Sam. 
BELLA Why would I stare? -- 
-- But the guys are already entering -- 
INT. EMILY'S HOUSE (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT 
Bella hesitantly enters behind Jared and Embry. She sees EMILY, 20, at a counter, popping fresh muffins out of a tin. SEE only one side of Emily's beautiful face, draped by long black hair. 
EMILY You guys hungry? Like I have to ask... Emily looks toward them now -- REVEALING the other side of her face: A scar runs from hairline to chin, three red lines that pull down her eye and twist her mouth. 
EMILY Who's this? 
As Jared and Embry beeline for the muffins -- 
JARED Bella Swan.    Who else? 
EMILY So you're the vampire girl. 
BELLA And you're a... you're all... 
EMILY Werewolves? I'm just engaged to one. But these animals -- (slaps Embry's hand) Save some for your brothers. 
BELLA It's Carlisle's car!   They're here. Go back! -- 
JACOB It's a trick -- 
He's still flooring it -- Bella cracks her door open while they're moving - he SLAMS on the brakes. She jumps out -- 
JACOB Damn it, Bella -- 
EXT. ROAD (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT 
Bella hurries up the road toward her house. Jacob's suddenly standing in front of her, furious -- 
JACOB Stop.   You gotta come with me. BELLA It's okay.   They're my friends -- 
JACOB Don't you get it? If a Cullen is back here, this is their territory. The Treaty says we can only defend our own lands. 
BELLA -- It's not a war -- 
JACOB It is. And you'll only be safe in La Push. I can't protect you here anymore. 
BELLA I don't need you to -- 
JACOB -- You're about to cross a line -- BELLA Only if you draw one. 
She starts to move past him, but he stops her -- 
JACOB I'm not letting you do this. 
BELLA You don't have a choice.   I don't belong to you. 
Her words are a knife to the heart. She sees that, but can't take them back. He hands her the keys. 
JACOB Bye, Bella, I hope you don't die. 
She flinches at the stinging remark. He disappears into the darkness, leaving her alone on the dark road. 
She's closer to her house than her truck. She hurries forward. The NIGHT SOUNDS start to encroach, branches crackling, bushes rustling. She glances behind her... nothing but darkness... she faces forward again --- 
And runs directly into a VAMPIRE! Bella SCREAMS -- then realizes IT'S ALICE. Bella is stunned. So is Alice. 
BELLA Alice! ALICE You're... alive. 
She's clearly confused, but Bella hugs her with tears of joy. 
BELLA Oh my God, Alice.    You're here. 
ALICE I heard voices - I didn't think it was you but - you're alive. 
BELLA You keep saying that. 
ALICE I saw you - a vision of you - you jumped off a cliff. I knew I'd be too late but -- (becoming angry) Why the hell would you try to kill yourself?! 
BELLA I didn't.    I was cliff diving. 
ALICE Why?! 
BELLA Um... fun? 
ALICE That was fun for you. 
BELLA Until I hit the water. 
ALICE I have never met anyone more prone to life-threatening idiocy... and what is that hideous wet dog smell? 
BELLA Oh. Probably Jacob.      He's kind of a werewolf. 
Off Alice's horrified expression. 
INT. BELLA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT As Bella makes herself hot chocolate, Alice paces. 
BELLA Werewolves are not vicious. 
ALICE Until they lose their tempers. 
BELLA They saved me from Laurent, they're protecting me from Victoria -- 
ALICE (shocked) Victoria? I didn't see her. I didn't see you get pulled from the water either. 
BELLA It was Jacob who saved me. More than once. I couldn't have made it without him. You have no idea what it was like. 
ALICE (softening) Yes. I do. I knew leaving wouldn't be good for you. I tried to tell Edward, but he wouldn't listen. 
BELLA (hesitantly) ... Does he know you're here? 
ALICE No.   He's been... away... 
INT. TENEMENT APARTMENT - RIO DE JANEIRO - DAY 
JACOB You alone? 
BELLA Yes.   Shouldn't you be at the funeral? 
JACOB Had to talk to you first. (to the guys) I'll meet you there. Go on. 
They're wary... but pull out.      Jacob follows Bella into -- 
INT. BELLA'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Jacob enters behind Bella.   She turns to him... BELLA Look, Jake, I'm sorry I -- 
JACOB This place stinks to hell. 
She sees he's shut down, cold.      She shuts down, as well. 
BELLA You're welcome to leave.      In fact -- 
JACOB -- How many Cullens are here and how long are they staying? 
BELLA (snapping back) Just Alice. And she'll stay as long as she wants. 
JACOB Are the rest coming back? 
BELLA Not that I'm aware of.      Anything else? 
JACOB That's it. 
BELLA Better go report to Sam. 
Jacob turns, starts to leave. He looks back, sees her anger turn to hurt. He stops. Beat. 
JACOB I've done it again. I keep breaking my promise not to hurt you. 
BELLA It doesn't have to be this way. 
He moves back to her, looks into her eyes with sadness. 
JACOB Yeah, it does. 
BELLA Am I gonna lose you this time, Jacob? 
He can't answer that, but he presses his hand to her cheek. JACOB It was easier when we were both human, wasn't it? 
They look at one another, Jacob's hand still on her face, his eyes searching hers. 
Slowly, he starts to bend toward her lips. She doesn't pull away. She misses him too much, needs him too badly. This time, she'll let it happen. A kiss is a centimeter away... 
Suddenly, the shrill RING of the phone makes them both jump. Jacob, the closest to it, doesn't move his face, just keeps looking into her eyes as he reaches for the phone, answers -- 
JACOB Swan residence. 
She smiles.   But he instantly bristles, voice going cold. 
JACOB He's not here. He's at a funeral... 
Then the phone goes dead -- 
INT. TENEMENT APARTMENT - RIO DE JANEIRO - SAME 
-- Edward stares at his phone crazed, enraged, grief- stricken -- he HURLS it against the wall, shattering it. 
INT. BELLA'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME 
-- Jacob hangs up the phone. 
JACOB Filthy bloodsucker. 
BELLA Wait, who was it? 
JACOB (spitting it out) Dr. Carlisle Cullen. 
BELLA You should have let me talk to him. 
JACOB He didn't ask for you -- 
Suddenly, Jacob's eyes go wild, his body stiffens, starts trembling in the way that precedes a wolf-morph. JACOB Step away from me, Bella. 
Bella turns to see what he's reacting to - Alice. She stands in doorway looking empty, despairing. Bella immediately hurries to her side. 
BELLA Alice, what's wrong? 
ALICE ... Edward. 
BELLA What about him? What happened? 
ALICE I just saw him in a vision.   He... thinks you're dead. 
Bella waits impatiently at the curb as -- 
A YELLOW HARD-TOP PORSCHE with darkly tinted windows SCREECHES to a halt in front of her. The passenger door opens - Alice is behind the wheel, pulling off the chic, white, hooded coat she used for protection against the sun. As Bella climbs in, buckles up -- 
BELLA Where'd you get the car? 
ALICE Hope you're not opposed to grand theft auto. 
BELLA Not today. 
Alice FLOORS it and the Porsche PEELS OUT -- 
EXT. TUSCAN COUNTRYSIDE - DAY 
AERIAL VIEW - THE YELLOW PORSCHE screams down a highway, cutting lanes, weaving through Peugots and Fiats -- 
INT. PORSCHE - DAY 
Bella grips the dashboard as Alice narrowly misses a car. 
BELLA How much time do we have. 
ALICE (O.S.) He's waiting till noon, when the sun's at its highest... SMASH TO: 
EXT. VOLTERRA - PALAZZO DEI PRIORI - DAY (ALICE'S VISION) 
It's jumpy, uneven -- EDWARD stands in shadow, his shirt open, eyes shut. A clock GONGS as he steps into SUNLIGHT -- 
ALICE ... He's going to make the Volturi change their minds. 
INT. PORSCHE - SAME 
BELLA (checking her watch) It's almost noon now. 
ALICE There's Volterra. 
Alice punches it as Bella SEES -- BELLA'S POV - A MEDIEVAL FORTIFIED VILLAGE atop a distant hill. Volterra. 
EXT. VOLTERRA - DAY 
The narrow, centuries-old streets are crowded with festival revellers who all wear RED. They gaily head toward the town square carrying red pendants, balloons, scarves. The PORSCHE weaves through them, hurrying forward. 
INTERCUT INSIDE THE PORSCHE -- 
BELLA Why are they all wearing red? 
ALICE San Marcos Day festival. The perfect setting. Large crowds. The Volturi won't let him get far enough to reveal himself - he's counting on that. 
BELLA We only have five minutes -- 
Alice screeches to a halt at a ROAD BLOCK.   Italian POLICE wave her back. Bella jumps out -- 
BELLA Where's the square? 
ALICE Follow that lane -- 
-- Bella's already running -- 
ALICE He'll be under the clock tower! 
Alice watches her go... then senses something, looks up -- 
ALICE'S POV - ON THE ROOFTOPS - A FIGURE IN A BLACK HOODED OVERCOAT leaps from building to building, tracking Bella. As he disappears, off Alice -- 
EXT. VOLTERRA ALLEYS - SERIES OF FAST CUTS - DAY 
Bella races down the cobble-stoned alleys, stumbling on the uneven stones. Festival revellers head in the same direction, she maneuvers around them. 
ABOVE BELLA - SEE flashes of the FIGURE IN THE OVERCOAT -- 
As Bella nears the square, the alleys become more populated. She pushes past people AD LIBBING "excuse me," "sorry." Finally, she emerges into -- 
EXT. PALAZZO DEI PRIORI (CONTINUOUS) - DAY 
BELLA'S POV - a sea of scarlet flags, dresses and jackets. On the other side of the crowded square - THE CLOCK TOWER; it reads one minute before noon. 
Bella battles her way through the square; the crowd shoves back, shouting at her in Italian -- 
ITALIAN MAN Fare attenzione! 
Bella charges forward to find herself blocked by -- 
A FOUNTAIN - Suddenly, GONG!    The clock tower bells chime. It's noon! 
Bella jumps into the fountain, wades through the shallow water to the other side -- she jumps out and barrels through the crowd. Finally, she SEES -- 
BELLA'S POV - BENEATH THE CLOCK TOWER 
EDWARD It's alright. Alice will catch you. 
Edward takes her wrists, dangles her over the hole -- INT. SEWERS (CONTINUOUS) - DAY 
-- ON BELLA as she drops through the darkness, to be caught by Alice. Edward lands beside them, then Felix and Demetri. 
Edward pulls Bella close as they follow Jane through the sewer. He meets Bella's eyes, trying to look reassuring, but he's tense as hell. Finally, they reach -- 
A FOLDING IRON ELEVATOR DOOR. Jane easily pulls it aside. They all enter. As the door CLANGS shut on them -- 
SMASH TO: 
CLOSE ON MODERN ELEVATOR DOORS OPENING. They all exit into -- 
INT. VOLTURI HEADQUARTERS - LOBBY (CONTINUOUS) - DAY 
An elegantly decorated space with old world charm. They're greeted politely by GIANNA an attractive (human) receptionist. 
GIANNA Buon pomeriggio. 
They head through the lobby to -- 
THE LONG CORRIDOR that Edward traversed earlier.   Finally, they reach the carved double doors which open -- 
INT. CIRCULAR WHITE MARBLE HALL (CONTINUOUS) - DAY 
Bella, Edward and Alice enter to face the three ancients: Aro, Marcus, Caius. 
Eight VOLTURI GUARDS (including Jane, Felix, Demetri) line the walls in a variety of modern dark overcoats. 
BELLA'S POV - THE FLOOR - there's a depression in the center that leads to a drain. Bella shivers. 
Aro rises, greets them like old friends, taking Edward's hand and shaking it -- 
ARO What a happy surprise! Bella is alive after all. Isn't that wonderful? 
Caius responds with a sour expression. Marcus could care less. Aro doesn't release Edward's hand, looks at him as -- 
ARO Her blood appeals to you so much it makes me thirsty. How can you stand to be so close to her? 
EDWARD It's not without effort. 
ARO (laughing) I can see that. 
Off Bella's look, Edward explains -- 
EDWARD One touch and Aro can see every thought I've ever had in my life. 
ARO You're quite the telepath yourself, Edward. Though... you can't read Bella's thoughts. Fascinating. 
He releases Edward's hand and turns to Bella. ARO I would love to see if you are an exception to my gifts, as well. 
He reaches for Bella's hand. She hesitates, does she have a choice? Aro laughs at her reluctance, further extends his hand. Bella finally takes it. 
A beat as he holds her hand... confusion sweeping over him. 
ARO Interesting. 
He releases her, moves back to his chair, deep in thought. 
ARO I wonder if -- 
EDWARD (reading Aro's thoughts) No! 
ARO Let's see if she's immune to all our powers, shall we Jane? 
Jane turns toward Bella but Edward springs in front of her -- 
Jane instead focuses her gaze on Edward which FLINGS him across the room where he collapses, writhing in agony. Jane concentrates on him with a small smile, enjoying his pain. BELLA Stop! 
Bella and Alice rush to his side.    As soon as Jane looks away, Edward's pain ceases. 
ARO Jane, dear.    The girl? 
Jane's gaze now turns toward Bella who cringes, awaiting the pain... but nothing happens. Jane's grin is replaced by anger. Aro laughs like a child with a new toy. 
Jane, infuriated, moves toward Bella, but Aro stops her with a tiny gesture. 
ARO Remarkable! She confounds us all.      So what do we do with you now? 
MARCUS (seemingly bored) You already know what you'll do, Aro. 
CAIUS She knows too much; she's a liability. 
ARO That's true. Unless Edward intends to give her immortality... (looks at Edward) But that's not your intention, is it. Shame. 
He nods to Felix who moves toward Bella, but he only takes a step before Edward tackles him. 
INT. VOLTURI HEADQUARTERS - LONG CORRIDOR (CONTINUOUS) - DAY 
-- Demetri leads Bella, Edward and Alice out of the hall. As they make their way up the corridor, they see coming toward them -- 
A GROUP OF TWO DOZEN TOURISTS, led by a beautiful vampire, HEIDI. Edward, Alice and Bella stop to let them all pass. As Heidi passes Demetri, he gives her a flirtatious smile -- 
DEMETRI (sotto) Nice fishing, Heidi, save some for me. 
Heidi smiles.   She gives Bella a curious once-over, then continues on. 
HEIDI (to the group) This way, please. Stay together... 
A HUSBAND and WIFE, 60's, cameras around their necks, pass Bella. The Husband winks at Bella -- 
TOURIST HUSBAND Unusual tour, isn't it? TOURIST WIFE Bill, get a picture of that bust there. 
As the Tourists file past, we HEAR a variety of languages, German, Japanese, English. 
The group is moved toward the carved double doors which swing open for them. They file into the marble hall -- 
Edward pulls Bella forward, but she cranes her neck back as the last of the tourists disappear inside. 
As the large doors close... we begin to HEAR SCREAMING -- 
Edward and Alice rush Bella out - PUSH IN ON BELLA'S TORMENTED FACE as the SCREAMING gets louder... and louder -- 
SMASH TO: 
INT. BELLA'S ROOM - NIGHT ON BELLA'S SLEEPING FACE as the SCREAMING CRESCENDOS -- Bella sits bolt upright, yelling -- 
BELLA -- Stop! 
She catches her breath, disoriented, confused. Then she turns to find Edward lying beside her, looking at her. 
BELLA It... wasn't a dream. 
EDWARD Go back to sleep. You've been through a lot. 
BELLA No, you might -- 
EDWARD I'll be here when you wake up. 
Beat, she looks at him, wary. 
BELLA Why?   Out of guilt? 
EDWARD (realizing) You... think I asked the Volturi to kill me because I felt guilty? BELLA Didn't you? 
EDWARD I went to them because I thought I'd lost you. 
BELLA You didn't even want me. 
Now Edward takes her by the shoulders. 
EDWARD Bella. The only reason I left was to protect you. I wanted you to have a chance at a normal, happy life. 
BELLA But it was so easy for you to leave. 
EDWARD I had to be convincing. But easy?     In my hundred years, I've never had a harder time than what I just went through. 
She's beginning to believe him. 
BELLA I kept seeing you. Visions of you. Always protecting me. I thought I was going crazy. 
EDWARD Your own instincts were speaking to you. I wish it had been me. But you're the heroic one. You saved me. 
He moves to kiss her... but abruptly stops.   Suddenly -- 
HER DOOR swings open - she spins toward it as the LIGHTS flip on and Charlie enters. Edward is gone. 
CHARLIE You alright? Another nightmare? 
BELLA I'm okay.    You don't have to worry. 
CHARLIE Last time you said that, you disappeared. You want to talk nightmares? BELLA (sincere) I'm really sorry, Dad. 
CHARLIE Just... don't ever do that to me again. Okay? (off her nod) And you're grounded for the rest of your life. 
BELLA I know. 
CHARLIE Get some rest so I can keep lecturing you in the morning. 
He kisses her forehead. Exits.     A beat... she turns to find Edward sitting on the bed. 
EDWARD He won't forgive me easily. 
BELLA Nope. 
VICTORIA (a slow grin) Sounds perfect. 
As she climbs in... 
INT. EDWARD'S CAR - MORNING 
Edward drives Bella home.    He is somber.   She is resigned. 
EDWARD When? BELLA After graduation. 
EDWARD Just two months. 
BELLA It'll be best for Dad that way. I can pretend to be at college somewhere. Carlisle suggested it. But... (quiet, emotional) I wish you'd be the one to change me. 
EDWARD (beat) Would you be willing to trade for that? 
BELLA (hopeful) Name it. 
EDWARD Five more years as a human. 
BELLA The Volturi won't wait that long. 
EDWARD I'll settle for three. 
BELLA (sadly, shakes her head) I won't risk it. It'll have to be Carlisle. 
He takes her hand. 
EDWARD Why are you so willing to give up your soul? 
BELLA Because I don't believe you've lost yours. And I want to share mine with you forever. 
He looks to her, kisses her hand... then suddenly Edward SLAMS on the brakes -- 
THEIR POV - THE ROAD 
-- Someone stands in the road directly in front of them -- it's JACOB. He glares, then turns and walks into the woods. BELLA What is he doing? 
EDWARD He wants to talk to me. 
BELLA Well, he can talk to me first. 
She pushes out of the car -- 
INT. WOODS - MORNING 
Edward and Bella tramp through the woods to FIND -- Jacob leaning against a tree. His expression is hard. 
JACOB You're still alive. 
BELLA I've been calling you. JACOB Couldn't drop by? 
EDWARD He thinks I'm keeping you away. 
JACOB (spinning on him) Stay the hell out of my head! 
BELLA Dad grounded me, Jake. We're trying to get back before he wakes up. 
Jacob doesn't buy it. Bella is frustrated. But Edward takes a step toward Jacob. Calm. Diplomatic. 
EDWARD Jacob, I know you have something to say to me, but I'd like to say something first. Alright? 
Jacob leans back against the tree, arms folded, waiting. 
EDWARD (sincere) Thank you. For keeping Bella alive when I... didn't. 
JACOB No, you didn't. And it wasn't for your benefit, trust me. 
EDWARD I know. I'm still grateful. (then) But I'm back now. And I'm not leaving Bella's side till she orders me away. 
She looks at him. He returns the look. Jacob sees the devotion between them. It wounds him. But he masks it. 
JACOB We'll see. 
EDWARD Either way, we'll handle Victoria from here on out. 
JACOB She's been laying low. Ever since your freaky sister showed up. Guess she can't stand you Cullens either. 
EDWARD She'll come back. 
JACOB She does, she's ours.   She killed on our turf. 
EDWARD We'll see. 
JACOB My turn to talk. I'm here to remind you about a key point in the Treaty. 
EDWARD (reads his thoughts, nods) I haven't forgotten.

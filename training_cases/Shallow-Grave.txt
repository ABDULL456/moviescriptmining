John Hodge 
FINAL DRAFT 
INT. DAY 
A blurred image forms on a white screen. A horizontal strip of face, eyes motionless and unblinking. 
DAVID (VOICE-OVER) Take trust, for instance, or friendship: these are the important things in life, the things that matter, that help you on your way. If you can't trust your friends, well, what then? 
EXT. DAWN 
A series of fast-cut static scenes of empty streets. 
DAVID (VOICE-OVER) This could have been any city: they're all the same. 
A rapid, swerving track along deserted streets and down narrow lanes and passageways. Accompanied by soundtrack and credits. 
The track ends outside a solid, fashionable Edinburgh tenement. 
INT. STAIRWELL. DAY 
At the door of a flat on the third floor of the tenement. The door is dark, heavy wood and on it is a plastic card embossed with the names of three tenants. They are Alex Law, David Stevens, and Juliet Miller. 
A man climbs the stairs and reaches the door. He is Cameron Clarke, thin and in his late twenties with a blue anorak and lank, greasy hair. He is carrying an awkwardly bulky plastic bag. Cameron gives the doorbell an ineffectual ring and then stands back, shifting nervously from foot to foot until the door is answered. 
CAMERON Hello, I've come about the room. 
Cameron enters and the door closes. 
INT. LIVING ROOM. DAY 
David, Alex, and Juliet sit in a line on the sofa directly opposite Cameron, who shifts uneasily in his armchair. Alex checks some items on a clipboard before speaking. 
ALEX What's his name? 
DAVID I don't know -- Campbell or something? 
JULIET Cameron. 
ALEX Cameron? 
JULIET Yes. 
ALEX (to Juliet) Really? 
CAMERON That's right. 
ALEX (to Cameron) What? 
Cameron is not sure what to say. 
ALEX (CONTINUED) Well, Cameron, are you comfortable? 
GOTH I've come about the room. 
INT. STAIRWELL. DAY 
At the door of the flat a Man aged about thrity-five rings the bell. 
INT. HALL. DAY 
Inside the hall of the flat Juliet approaches the door to open it. Freeze-frame. 
DAVID (VOICE-OVER) Like one of those stupid posters -- you know, a gorilla cuddling a hedgehog, caption love hurts --- that's what I think when I think of Juliet. 
Juliet opens the door to the Man. 
MAN I've come about the room. 
INT. LIVING ROOM. DAY 
In the living room each of the candidates is interviewed individually with the same seating arrangements as before (i.e. the trio on the sofa and the applicant on the chair). What we see are briskly intercut excerpts from each of these interviews. We do not get the responses to the questions, although we may see some facial reaction. 
All of David's questions are to the Woman. 
All of Alex's questions are to the Goth. 
All of Juliet's questions are to the Man. 
DAVID All right, just a few questions. 
ALEX I'd like to ask you about your hobbies. 
JULIET Why do you want a room here? 
DAVID Do you smoke? 
ALEX When you slaughter a goat and wrench its heart out with your bare hands, do you then summon hellfire? 
JULIET I mean, what are you actually doing here? What is the hidden agenda? 
DAVID Do a little freebasemaybe, from time to time? 
ALEX Or maybe just phone out for a pizza? 
JULIET Look, it's a fairly straightforward question. You're either divorced or you're not. 
DAVID OK, I'm going to play you just a few seconds of this tape -- I'd like you to name the song, the lead singer and the three hit singles subsequently recorded by him with another band. 
ALEX When you get up in the morning, how do you decide what shade of black to wear? 
JULIET Now, let me get this straight. This affair that you're not having, is it not with a man or not with a woman? 
DAVID Turning very briefly to the subject of corporate finance -- no, this is important. Leveraged buy-outs -- a good thing or a bad thing? 
ALEX With which of the following figures do you most closely identify: Joan of Arc, Eva Braun or Marilyn Monroe? 
JULIET It's just that you strike me as a man trapped in a crisis of emotional direction, afflicted by a realization that the partner of your dreams is, quite simply, just that. 
DAVID Did you ever kill a man? 
HUGO Shall I answer it? 
JULIET No, just leave it. He knows I must be at home. I'm working nights this week. 
The telephone continues to ring. 
HUGO Working nights? 
JULIET I'm a doctor. 
HUGO And he's a patient of yours? 
JULIET No. But he needs treatment. 
HUGO For what? 
JULIET A certain weakness. 
HUGO The human condition. 
JULIET You know about it? 
HUGO I write about it? 
JULIET And that's not the same thing? 
HUGO No, but like all novelists, I'm in search of the self. 
INT. KITCHEN. MORNING 
Juliet, dressed and fatigued, sits at the table sipping a coffee. Alex is also seated at the table, but wearing an old dressing- gown and munching at cornflakes while he reads a newspaper and talks at the same time. An array of other papers is spread over the table. 
ALEX Has he tried down the back of the fridge? I mean, that's where I normally find things. 
JULIET He seemed like a nice guy, Alex. 
Juliet gets up and leaves the kitchen. The soundof a bath running is heard. 
ALEX I'm not saying he didn't seem like a nice guy. All I'm saying is, it's a bit strange, and this search for the self, and what he's on about, you know. 
Alex hears the mail falling through the door and stands up to leave the kitchen and get it. 
JULIET (calling from outside) He didn't seem strange, Alex.He seemed, you know -- 
INT. BATHROOM.MORNING. 
Juliet watches the bath fill. 
JULIET ...interesting. 
INT. KITCHEN. MORNING 
Alex considers her reply. 
ALEX Interesting. Interesting. 
INT. HALL. MORNING 
DAVID People can be so cruel. 
ALEX So, uh... 
HUGO What? 
ALEX What? 
HUGO You were going to say something. 
ALEX What was I trying to say? Oh, yes, I think, we think, or at least I suppose we think -- am I right? 
JULIET Just get on with it, Alex. 
DAVID Keep it going, Alex. You're unstoppable now. 
ALEX We think it's fine. 
Alex starts eating again. The others watch him expectantly. David coughs. 
ALEX (CONTINUED) It's OK. There's no problem. 
HUGO You mean I can have the room? 
ALEX Well, that's what I said, isn't it? 
DAVID He made it clear. 
ALEX Why, thank you, David. 
JULIET Yes, you can have the room. 
Alex pours yet more alcohol. 
ALEX I'm not usually drunk. 
JULIET Not usually this drunk. 
DAVID Only on expenses. 
ALEX It's true. A newspaper is paying for all this. A newspaper... 
With exaggerated scorn, Alex knocks over a glass of wine. 
JULIET In a moment he's going to tell he could have been someone -- 
ALEX It was you, Juliet, it was you -- 
JULIET -- instead of what he is -- 
ALEX What I am. 
JULIET -- which is -- 
ALEX -- which is a hack. 
JULIET The man we know and love. 
INT. HUGO'S ROOM. DAY 
Hugo unpackshis bags. Included in his things are a few syringes and needles. All these he puts into the drawer beside his bed. He checks inside a second bag. 
INT. HALL. DAY 
Hugo dails a number on the telephone and awaits a reply. 
INT. JULIET'S ROOM. EVENING 
Juliet is woken by her alarm clock. The time is five p.m. 
INT. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT 
Alex sits watching television, constantly changing channels. Juliet walks in, wearing a dressing gown. She watches Alex for a few moments. 
JULIET Have you seen Hugo? 
ALEX No. Any idea which channel he's on? 
INT. HALL. MORNING 
The telephone is ringing. Alex lifts up the reciever. Again he is wearing his dressing gown and is on his way to pick up the mail. 
ALEX No, she's not in. Without waiting for any more, he replaces the reciever and walks to the door, where he picks up the mail. On his way back from the door, David emerges, ready to go to work. 
ALEX (CONTINUED) Have you seen him? 
DAVID Alex, I don't have the time -- 
ALEX Yes or no, yes or no, yes or -- 
DAVID No. 
David leaves, slamming the door. 
INT. KITCHEN. MORNING 
Alex returns to the kitchen, pausing only to knock at Hugo's door, which elicits no response. In the kitchen Juliet sits dressed for work, having just returned. He casually opens an envelope and glances at both sides of the letter before handing it to her. 
ALEX David hasn't seen him either. 
JULIET So I gathered. 
ALEX Maybe he didn't like us. 
JULIET David? 
ALEX Hugo. 
JULIET His car's still there. 
ALEX He's got a car? 
JULIET So what's wrong with that? 
ALEX What sort of car? 
JULIET What are you doing? 
ALEX I'm just looking. 
JULIET Don't. 
ALEX Don't look? 
JULIET No. 
ALEX Why not? What's wrong, Juliet? Aren't you curious? Don't you wonder what he died from? 
JULIET No.The guy's dead.What more do you need? 
ALEX It's not every day I find a story in my own flat. 
JULIET Thats not a story, Alex. It's a corpse. 
ALEX Old newspaper proverb says dead human being is living story. Be rational, please, and failing that be quiet. 
In a drawer in a bedside cabinet, Alex finds needles, syringes and a small bag of powder. Without comment, he holds it up and throws it on the bed. 
He reaches under the bed and pulls out a case, which he opens. It is empty and he pushes it back under. 
DAVID I've never seen a dead body before. 
JULIET Alex, I think it's time for you to stop. 
Alex continues to search. Juliet walks out. 
INT. HALL. NIGHT 
Juliet stands alone. 
INT. HUGO'S ROOM. NIGHT 
Alex continues his brisk search through Hugo's posesseions while David looks on, appalled but speechless. 
INT. HALL. NIGHT 
Juliet listens to the sounds from the bedroom, then picks up the telephone. She dials 999 and waits for a reply. It rings and rings. 
INT. HUGO'S ROOM. NIGHT 
Alex has found and opened a large Gladstone bag. Neither David norwe can see into it. 
DAVID I saw my grandmother, of course, but I don't suppose that counts. I mean, she was alive at the time. 
ALEX Can I show you something? 
INT. HALL. NIGHT 
Juliet awaits an answer. 
Alex approaches Juliet with the open bag. She turns around and looks into it, then, seeing the contents, she replaces the receiver. As she does so, the Operator's voice is audible for a second. 
OPERATOR Hello, emergency services. 
ALEX Now, was there a pet in the house? Yes, a pet, like a dog or a budgie or a gerbil. You see, what I need is PC Plod rescues Harry the Hamster from House of Horror'. All right... well, that's a pity, you see, no pets, no human angle. 
Alex hangs up. 
INT. HUGO'S ROOM. DAY 
Another view of the body: for example, from above. 
INT. HOSPITAL. DAY 
In the accident and emeregency department of a busy hospital, Juliet sifts through a setof casenotes. Another Doctor approaches her. 
DOCTOR Hi, there. 
Juliet does not look up. 
JULIET Hello. 
DOCTOR What happened to that guy? 
JULIET What guy? 
DOCTOR That guy, the one that died. 
Juliet looks up. 
JULIET What guy that died? 
DOCTOR That one, last week. 
JULIET Here?. 
DOCTOR Yeah, here, I mean, where else? 
JULIET Oh, him. Well, he died. 
DOCTOR (SATISFIED) That's what I thought. 
INT. HUGO'S ROOM. DAY 
The body, stillpresent, exposed and motionless. The curtain flutters by the open window. 
INT. LUMSDEN'S OFFICE. DAY 
Lumsden, a middle-aged chartered accountant, isseated in a largechair behind a desk. He is talking to David,who appears distracted. 
LUMSDEN What do we do here, David? 
DAVID Sorry? 
LUMSDEN Here. 
DAVID Right here? 
LUMSDEN In this firm. 
DAVID Well, it's a wide range of, eh -- 
The corpse as before. 
INT. ACCOUNTANT'S OFFICE. DAY 
David sits at his desk, looking across the office. 
Crouched over a large array of other desks, young men and women in suits are pouring over folders and columned books. No one is speaking except in muted tones on the telephones. 
David watches them. He looks to his left and to his right: on either side young men like him are toiling over accounts. He turns and looks behind him, where another array of accountants sit. 
He turns back to his desk and opens the file he was previously given. He looks at the columns of records of profit, with a large total at the bottom. 
When David looks up he sees Juliet seated beside his desk. She smiles and directs his gaze, with her own, to the surrounding scene. 
INT. HUGO'S ROOM. EVENING 
The body in silhouette. 
DAVID (VOICE-OVER) OK. Let's do it. 
INT. DIY STORE. DAY 
Inside a large, brightly lit DIY store with Muzak playing in the background. We start with a tracking shot along an aisle stacked with potentially vicious tools. 
ALEX (VOICE-OVER) All right, now listen. We have to dispose of the body in such a way as to make it unidentifiable, so that even if it is found, then it's never anything more than an unknown corpse. Burning, dumping at sea, and straightforward burial are all flawed either by fingerprints, or, more commonly, by dental records. This I have learned. Now, what I suggest is that we bury him out in the forest, but first of all we remove his hands and his feet, which we incinerate. And his teeth, which we just remove. It's as simple as that. 
As the tracking shot ends, we see David's head and shoulders as he looks at something off picture. Suddenly a spring-loaded screwdriver appears and is fired' so that the tip stops a few millimeters from his face. David winces as we see that Alex is holding it. 
ALEX (CONTINUED) I always wondered what these were for. 
Alex places the screwdriver down on the shelf and walks across the aisle to pick up a saw and a hammer. 
ALEX (CONTINUED) Now this is what we need. And this. 
Alex hands the tools to David, who looks at them with disgust. Alex walks on. 
ALEX (CONTINUED) Now what else? DAVID I don't know. 
ALEX A spade, we need a spade -- I wish you would concentrate -- we need a spade if we're going to dig a pit. 
DAVID So who's going to do it? 
ALEX Dig the pit, I don't know. 
DAVID No, not that. 
ALEX Then what? Who's going to do what? 
DAVID You know what I'm talking about. 
ALEX Do I? What? What? What are you talking about? 
DAVID You know what. Who's going to do it. 
ALEX We all are, David, we're all going to do it. Each of us, you, me and Juliet, will do his or her bit. Is that fair enough? 
DAVID I can't do it. 
ALEX (to himself) I don't know why we couldn't stuff it in a mattress or put it under the floor like any normal human being. We could have hid it in the fridge. 
INT. LOFT. DAY 
David moves on into the dark cavernous loft, edging his way across beams and pipes. There are no skylights. 
He stops and leans against some structure (the water tank). He strains to see in the darkness. 
Suddenly there is a loud sucking and flowing noise as water empties from the water tank. David is startled and steps forward, tripping. He reaches out as he falls, striking a light switch. Briefly the loft is illuminated: David blinking as he lies across some beams, the large cavernous area, the pipes, the water tank, the bag of money lying between two rafters, and then the old brass switches beginning to spark and the light goes out. 
David scrambles towards the trapdoor. 
INT. HUGO'S ROOM. DAY 
Now clean and empty, with no trace of recent habitation. 
INT. HOSPITAL. DAY 
In a basement corridor in the hospital, pipes run along the ceiling. Above a fenced-off area is a sign saying For Incineration Only -- No Aerosols'. On the floor of this area are yellow plastic sacks. Juliet appears around a corner carrying one of these. Quite casually the clumps it on the pile and continues past. 
EXT. QUARRY. EVENING 
Alex pushes a blue car into a quary. 
INT. SUBURBAN LOCK-UP GARAGE. NIGHT 
In the garage there is a car, gardening equipment, several sacks of fertilizer and a trunk-style deep freeze, on the lid of which sit Andy and Tim. Tim takes out a cigarette and offers one to Andy, who declines. 
They slide off the deep freeze and open it. 
Inside the freezer there is a man, naked and bound with cord. They lift him up. He is very cold and weak. 
The Man begins to whisper inaudibly. Andy moves his head so that he can hear the whisper. He listens, then nods approvingly. 
They push him down again and close the lid. Andy holds the lid while Tim dumps the sacks of fertilizer on top. 
INT. CHARITY BALL. NIGHT 
Alex, David and Juliet are attending a charity ball. Everyone is dressed very smartly, in ball gowns and black ties with the addition of a significant number of kilts. 
Neither Alex nor David wears a kilt. The trio seem to know a number of people there but do not seem especially keen to speak to them. 
A middle-aged, podgy, mustachioed Master of Ceremonies is standing on a platform in front of the band, making a speech to the diners who are still sat at their tables. 
MC Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention please. First of all, may I thank you all for coming along tonight and supporting our appeal to raise funds for the sick children's unit. 
There is a quick drum roll and applause breaks out. We move to the table where Alex, David and Juliet are seated. Alex leans across to Juliet. 
ALEX You didn't tell me that this was for children. I hate children. I'd raise money to have the little fuckers put down. 
Some other guests around the table cast critical glances at Alex. 
JULIET Sshh. 
ALEX I want my money back. Excuse me. 
Alex signals to the waiter by lifting his hand and snapping his fingers, then indicates another bottle of champagne that already ists in front of him. 
ALEX What's the problem? 
DAVID I want to talk now. 
ALEX After you drink to love and happiness forever. 
DAVID Now. 
ALEX After. 
JULIET David, I promise we will. Keep him happy. 
ALEX It's not for me. It's for love and happiness forever. 
David reaches out to take his glass. Suddenly, Alex flings an arm out to point, knocking over David's glass and completely losing interest. 
ALEX (CONTINUED) Look over there. It's Cameron. 
JULIET Who? 
ALEX Cameron. You remember Cameron. 
JULIET No, I don't. 
ALEX What's he doing here? 
JULIET That's not him. 
ALEX Yes, it is. It's him. Cameron, Cameron, come on over.Yo! 
From some distance away, Cameron becomes aware of Alex and cautiously makes his way across until he stands a few feet from the table. 
CAMERON What? 
ALEX Nothing. We thought you were someone else. 
Alex falls forward, laughing, and the other two also laugh as Cameron walks away, humiliated again. 
ALEX (CONTINUED) Good luck. I love that guy, but why does he have to follow us around? 
DAVID Anyway, what I was wanting to say was this -- 
BRIAN (UNSEEN) The divine Juliet. Long time no see. 
Brian approaches and is standing behind their table. 
JULIET Brian. 
BRIAN Would you care to dance? 
DAVID Hold on there. Who do you think you are? 
BRIAN What? 
DAVID Who do you think you are? You interrupted us. 
BRIAN I'm Brian McKinley, and who are you? 
DAVID From what? Jehovah's Witnesses? 
DAVID There was a break-in. 
ALEX Downstairs, I know. Pensioner's terror ordeal: page six. 
Alex hands David a rolled-up newspaper. 
DAVID Doesn't it worry you? 
ALEX No, it doesn't. I tried to let it worry me but it won't. I've worked on that paper for three years. There is a pensioner's terror ordeal on page six every day. Every day. Maybe when I'm a pensioner it'll worry me. 
Alex notices some more tools and the stepladder leading up to the trapdoor. 
ALEX (CONTINUED) What's all this for, more security? 
DAVID I fitted a lock up there. On the inside. 
ALEX Oh, that'll come in useful. 
INT. KITCHEN. NIGHT 
Alex is serving on plates from a large bowl of pasta. 
David and Juliet sit at the tabel. 
JULIET Is this the same stuff you made last week? 
ALEX No, no, it's different. 
JULIET I hope it tastes better than the other stuff. 
ALEX It tastes different. 
JULIET I don't want it to taste different. I don't know why I bother. Is that enough for you? Hey! 
DAVID What? Yes, that's fine. 
ALEX You're sure? There's lots more. 
DAVID No, I'm sure, that'll be enough. 
ALEX What's wrong? 
DAVID Nothing. 
ALEX You're not eating. 
DAVID Not eating what? 
ALEX Not eating like you used to, that's what. 
DAVID If you give me the plate, I'll eat. 
Alex hands him the plate and he starts to eat. Alex watches him chew a mouthful. 
ALEX Now swallow. 
ALEX He can't stay up there. 
JULIET He'll come down. Leave him alone. 
ALEX Yeah, he's got to go to work, hasn't he? You think he'll come down for that? 
JULIET No, but he's looking after the money, so what's the problem? 
ALEX Looking after it -- he's probably fucking well eating it. 
INT. HOSPITAL. DAY 
Juliet looks through the door from a small office out into the main waiting area in the casualty departmet. It is busy and there are rooms of people nursing injuries waiting to be seen. More file past the door while she watches with no enthusiasm. 
INT. HALL. DAY 
The trapdoor opens. David's head appears. He looks around and listens carfeully. 
INT. LUMSDEN'S OFFICE. DAY 
Lumsden answers his telephone. 
INT. HALL. DAY 
David speaks on the telephone. 
DAVID It's my mother, sir, she's very ill and I think I need to be with her just now. I don't know. The doctors aren't sure. It could go either way. Yes, sir, I'll certainly stay in touch. 
INT. BATHROOM. DAY 
David shaves carefully with a safety razor. 
INT. KITCHEN. DAY 
Bacon and eggs fry in a pan. David attends to them while drinking from a large tumbler of orange juice. 
INT. HOSPITAL. DAY 
A Sister hands Juliet a casualty case sheet. Juliet reads it. 
JULIET Painful groin? What does that mean? 
SISTER I don't know. He wouldn't show me. 
Juliet draws back the curtain of a cubicle. Alex is sitting on a trolly. ALEX Boy, am I glad to see you. 
JULIET What are you doing here? 
ALEX We have to talk. 
JULIET Your painful groin? 
She turns and walks away. Alex chases after her. 
ALEX Later. But first -- him. 
JULIET David? 
INT. HALL. NIGHT 
Alex, slightly puzzled, fixes the security chains before opening the door. As soon as he opens it, the door is kicked wide open as the security chains break off. Tim and Andy enter the flat. 
In a whirlwind of force they drag and shove Alex and Juliet into the living room and bind them up with cord. There are no words apart from slightly muffled cries. 
At the end of this Andy stands in front of Alex holding a crowbar. Swiftly and without warning, he cracks it across Alex's shins. Then Andy slowly puts one one end of the crowbar into Alex's mouth. For a moment he does nothing, then just as slowly again, he takes the crowbar out. 
ALEX It's in the loft. 
INT. HALL. NIGHT 
The trapdoor is closed but the sound of it being unlocked can just be heard (although not by anyone in the flat. 
INT. HALL. NIGHT 
Tim pulls the ladder across to the trapdoor. 
INT. LOFT. NIGHT 
It is completely dark in the loft, but as the trapdoor opens a shaft of light strikes upwards and illuminates a small pool around the opening. 
INT. LOFT. NIGHT 
Away from the trapdoor there appears to be a wall of uniform darkness, but then we see a pair of eyes in the darkness. It is David. He stands perfectly still. 
There is a hammer in his right hand. 
INT. LOFT. NIGHT 
Tim's head appears through the trapdoor. Cautiously he lifts himself through and balances on the beams. 
INT. HALL. NIGHT 
The hall is empty, but we can see the open trapdoor. Suddenly there is a single thud, as might be caused by a body landing heavily on and across some beams in the loft. 
INT. LOFT. NIGHT 
David stands motionless in the dark, exactly as before. 
INT. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT 
Andy has heard the single thud. He strains to hear anything else but does not. Slowly he backs away to the door of the living room, keeping the crowbar trained on Alex as he does so. He looks back and up towards the trapdoor. 
INT. LOFT. NIGHT 
Once again a small pool of light emanates from the open trapdoor. Andy emerges into the front of this, crowbar in hand, peering into the darkness. Carefully he stands up and moves out of the light and steps across the beams. His foot strikes something and he looks down. Tim's body lies spread-eagled beneath him. He looks up. To one side of him is the brass light switch. Andy lifts his arm, reaches towards it and switches it on. Sparks pour out for a moment and then the light comes on for a fraction of a second, long enough for Andy to see David's face is only centimetres from his own. 
INT. HALL. NIGHT 
Alex and Juliet are bound together as before. There is a loud thud from the ceiling, following by a few heavy steps. Then Andy's body falls headfirst through the trapdoor, straight down to the floor below, landing awkwardly and coming to rest with his head hanging back, looking towards Alex and Juliet. Andy takes one agonal breath and dies. Blood trickles from the side of his mouth. 
Tim's body lands on Andy. 
David drops himself from the hatch to the floor. 
David takes a large knife from a wooden block. 
Alex sits watching The Wicker Man on televison. He can hear the footsteps above. He turns the sound up on the television so that he cannot hear them, but he keeps looking up at the ceiling, as though he expects to hear them or see somwthing. 
Eventually he turns the sound back down and, after a moment's silence, the footsteps start again, back and forth, then stop. 
Alex looks up. 
Without warning there is the sound of an electric drill. 
The blade of the drill appears through the ceiling and is then withdrawn. Alex is shocked. Other drill holes appear. 
INT. VARIOUS CEILINGS. NIGHT 
Holes are drilled in the ceilings. 
INT. LOFT. NIGHT 
Rods of light penetrate up from the holes, interrupting but not obliterating the darknes. David sits back, pleased with his work. 
INT. JULIET'S ROOM. NIGHT 
Juliet sits at her desk. Alex stands in the doorway. He is about to speak. Juliet raises a finger to her lips. They both look at the ceiling. 
EXT. GARDEN AT FRONT OF THE FLAT. NIGHT 
Establishing shot of Alex and Juliet in garden. 
INT. HALL. NIGHT 
The trapdoor is open. 
INT. ALEX'S ROOM. NIGHT 
David is searching through Alex's desk, looking through letters and folders, then shoving them back into drawers. 
EXT. GARDEN AT THE FRONT OF THE FLAT. NIGHT 
ALEX No, definitely not. And that's that. I refuse to discuss it further. 
JULIET It's the only way. 
ALEX I refuse. 
JULIET You're frightened. 
ALEX No, I'm not frightened. A little terrified maybe. Did you see what happened to the last two who tried that? They went up alive and they came down dead -- the difference, I mean, alive dead dead alive, that sort of thing. It wasn't difficult to spot. He killed them both: he cut them up. 
INT. JULIET'S ROOM. NIGHT 
David is now searching through Juliet's desk. He picks up a large brown envelope and looks into it. Beneath it is the airline ticket envelope. 
The doorbell rings. 
INT. THROUGH THE SPYHOLE. NIGHT 
McCall and Mitchell stand outside the door. 
INT. HALL. NIGHT 
DAVID I see. 
MCCALL I doubt it. And these two other people, did they hear anything? 
DAVID No, they were asleep. They didn't even wake up. 
MCCALL Yes. Why do you think you woke and they didn't? 
DAVID I don't know. Maybe I'm a light sleeper. 
Uncomfortably, David realizes that Mitchell has noted down even this last, trivial remark in a painful longhand and has underlined a short segment of it. 
INT. HALL. NIGHT 
In the hallway of the flat Mitchell stands at the open main door, waiting to leave. McCall is kneeling at the door to Hugo's room, tracing his finger down the broken lintel and lock. David looks on. 
MCCALL Loks like you had a break-in up here as well. 
DAVID Someone lost the key. 
McCall gently pushes the door open and the light from the hall illuminates Hugo's room. 
MCCALL Is this where no one stays? 
DAVID Yeah, that's right, that's it. 
David notices that Mitchell is writing this down. 
INT. GARDEN AT FRONT OF THE FLAT. NIGHT 
ALEX You'll wait in the hall? 
JULIET I'll wait there. 
ALEX And if it sounds like I'm being killed, you'll phone the police, you'll tell them everything? 
JULIET Everything. 
ALEX Everything. Except maybe that it was his idea and not mine in the first place. OK? That's important to me. I need to die misunderstood. 
JULIET Alex. 
ALEX What? 
JULIET As smart as you are, you'll need a little help. 
She hands Alex a Yale key. Alex stares at it. 
INT. LOFT. NIGHT 
In the darkness, the sound of the lock being turned is heard. 
INT. HALL. NIGHT 
Alex tsands at the top of the ladder, holding the key in the trapdoor lock. 
ALEX All right, David, what I'm going to do is, I'm going to open this lock and I'm going to come up, and what's important is that you remain calm. 
DAVID Visitors? Some friends maybe? Someone you talked to? 
JULIET No one. I promise. 
DAVID Who have you talked to? 
JULIET No one. 
DAVID If I think you're lying --

INT. LOFT. NIGHT 
Alex is about to descend when he notices the water tank. He walks over and lifts the lid. His face breaks into a smile as he realizes what it holds. He dips an arm into the tank, raises the yellow bag, then quickly lowers it again. Alex steps back from the water tank. 
INT. HALL. NIGHT 
Alex appears at the top of the ladder. Without looking, he slides down as quickly as he can, calling out as he does so. 
ALEX Juliet, I have -- 
Alex reaches the base of the ladder. He turns around to find himself facing the blade of the battery-operated drill, held by David. Juliet stands off to one side. 
ALEX (CONTINUED) -- a problem. 
David holds the drill even closer until it is almost touching the centre of Alex's forehead and presses the trigger' to turn the blade slowly as he speaks. 
Alex does not move at all. 
DAVID You looking for me? 
ALEX Looking for you? Yes. 
DAVID What for? What did you want? The money? Was that it? 
ALEX We just wanted to speak to you. 
Alex's hands and sleeves are wet. A few drops of water fall from his fingertips. Unnoticed by the other two, he slowly wipes his hands on the back of his jeans. 
DAVID Who else have you wanted to speak to? Maybe you thought they'd already got me. 
The blade os the drill scrapes Alex's skin. 
ALEX Who? 
DAVID Your friends. 
ALEX I don't know what you're talking about.

David takes orange juice out of the fridge and pours himself a glass. He sits at the table and looks briefly into a corner that we cannot see. The expression oh his face does not change and his voice is impassive. 
DAVID I thought you'd gone to work. 
JULIET (UNSEEN) With a face like this?

INT. MONITOR SCREEN/NEWSPAPER OFFICE. DAY 
In close-up we track along the following half-sentence: In the event of my death I want the following facts to be known:' -- 
The remainder of the screen is blank. 
Alex sits at his desk, deciding what to type next on the screen seen before. A young Office Boy approaches his desk. 
OFFICE BOY The editor wants to see you. 
INT. KITCHEN. MORNING 
David sits while Juliet talks. She is now seated behind him. 
JULIET I remember how things used to be here, and I see how they are now, and I don't know why it is. I don't know how we let you become like this. We were your friends and we should have looked after you.

the Ghost and the Darkness - by William Goldman 
"THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS" 
by 
William Goldman 
FADE IN ON 
A TINY FIGURE OF A MAN hurrying toward camera. The figure gets larger as he approaches. But as yet we cannot tell who he is or where we are. 
MALE VOICE (over) This is the most famous true story of Africa. It happened a hundred years ago, but even now, when children ask about it, you do not tell them at night. (The FIGURE continues to grow) It began with the race to build a railroad across Africa. (beat) But this is not about building a railroad- it is about Patterson. 
And now we can tell that the FIGURE is a YOUNG MAN, A LIEUTENANT COLONEL. This is PATTERSON. He is gifted and bright and serious, serious about his life, serious about his career. He has been successful in everything he's attempted, in part because of his talents, in part because he is willing to outwork anybody. 
AND THIS IS WHERE WE ARE: ENGLAND. 
More specifically, in a high-ceilinged corridor of an elegant building - lovely woodwork all around. Everything is neat, everything is clean and in order. 
MALE VOICE (over) Patterson was thirty. A brilliant engineer. A fine man, but do not become attached to him- there are many fine men in this story but do not become attached to any of them. (beat) So many of them die. 
Patterson stops at a large ornate door, knocks. Waits. 
MALE VOICE (over) And remember this: only the impossible parts of what follows really happened... (Now the door opens and we-) 
CUT TO 
Just a wonderfully handsome man standing in the doorway. This is ROBERT BEAUMONT - 40, with an irresistable smile. We're in his office and the place reflects the man - clean, cold. There are maps and charts on the walls. He ushers Patterson inside. 
BEAUMONT (The great smile flashes) John Henry Patterson, come in. I'm Robert Beaumont. (They shake hands) Firm- I like that, tells me a lot about you- (beat) -now why don't you tell me about me? To get you started, many people find me handsome, with a wonderful smile. I'm sure you agree. (Surprised, uncomfortable, Patterson nods) Winning personality, heaps of charm? 
PATTERSON My wife is the game player in the family, sir. 
BEAUMONT Games? (staring dead at Patterson) Look at me closely, Patterson: I am a monster. My only pleasure is tormenting people who work for me, such as yourself. (again the smile - only now it's chilling) One mistake and I promise you this: I'll make you hate me. 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON, as he realizes Beaumont is serious. Beaumont turns sharply and moves to a large map. 
CUT TO 
THE MAP. It covers a great deal of East Africa with a very clear line that ends at Lake Victoria, a distance of some 600 miles. 
BEAUMONT (pointing along the line) We are building this railroad across Africa for the glorious purpose of saving Africa from the Africans. And, of course, to end slavery. The Germans and French are our competition. We are ahead, and we will stay ahead providing you do what I hired you to do- 
CUT TO 
A MORE DETAILED MAP. This one ends at "Tsavo," 130 miles in. 
BEAUMONT -build the bridge over the Tsavo river. And be finished in four months time. Can you do that? 
PATTERSON I'm sure you've examined my record. So you know I've never yet been late on a bridge. 
BEAUMONT You've never built in Africa. 
PATTERSON But I have in India- every country presents problems. 
BEAUMONT You'll need your confidence, I promise you. 
PATTERSON I've got a reason far beyond confidence: my wife is having our firstborn in five months and I promised I'd be with her when the baby comes. 
BEAUMONT Very moving, Patterson; I'm touched you confided in me. (beat) But I don't really give a shit about your upcoming litter. I've made you with this assignment- (the smile) -don't make me break you. 
PATTERSON (smiling right back) You won't have the chance. (glancing at his watch) Any further words of encouragement? (silence) Then I've a train to catch. 
They look at each other a moment in silence - and it's very clear they do not like each other. Patterson turns, leaves and we 
CUT TO 
A RAILWAY STATION, IMMEDIATELY AFTER 
A train is loading up. A lot of activity, a lot of noise. Patterson stands in the midst of it, anxiously looking around. 
CUT TO 
HELENA PATTERSON, hurrying through the crowd. Early 20s, with the kind of serene beauty of Jean Simmons. She is still slim, has not begun to show. She spots him, puts a smile on, goes straight into his arms. 
HELENA I tried to be late, John- it would have been easier if you'd gone. 
PATTERSON (They are nutty about each other - he nods) We're not much good at goodbyes, Helena. 
HELENA (brightly) Tell me about Beaumont- does he understand how brilliant you are, how lucky he is to have you? 
PATTERSON It was embarrassing- the man showered me with compliments. 
They start to walk hand in hand along the platform toward a quieter place. Patterson is suddenly very serious- 
HELENA Oh dear- (beat) -you're geting that downtrodden look again- 
PATTERSON -well, it's just... (beat) ...other men don't abandon their wives at such a time- 
HELENA (not unkindly) -oh please- if I'd been against your taking this, you would have abandoned me. You've been desperate to see Africa your whole life. 
PATTERSON What if there are complications?- 
HELENA -not "what if"- there will be, there always are. Which only means that our "son" and I- note my confidence- will have an excuse to come visit. 
THE TRAIN WHISTLE sounds. 
HELENA Go, now. (He kisses her hand) Such a gentleman. (Now he holds her) 
PATTERSON I am desperate to see Africa- but I hate the leaving. 
CUT TO 
HELENA. She hates it, too. 
HELENA You build bridges, John- (beat) -you've got to go where the rivers are. 
They hold each other a moment more, then break, then back into each other's arms a final time, then- 
CUT TO 
THE TRAIN, and thick clouds of steam- 
PATTERSON Well, he put me in a spot, didn't he? But that's all right- after all, I'm responsible for everything that happens here. And it certainly won't do much for morale if a man-eater's on the prowl. 
He goes into his tent with some books now and we go with him. There is a photo of Helena on a small table. A photo of an ELDERLY COUPLE, clearly his parents. His clothes are stacked with precision. He arranges his books precisely too. 
Clearly, John Patterson is a man who believes in order. 
STARLING (calling out) You said "of course" you'd need the donkey. Why "of course"? 
PATTERSON (taking a rifle, moving outside) We know three things about man-eaters. First, they always return to where they've attacked before. Second, they're always old- they can't catch other animals so they turn to us. And third, they're always alone- they've been cast out by their pride because they can't keep up. 
CUT TO 
STARLING, sipping his tea and there's no hiding it, he's excited. But also a bit reluctant. 
STARLING I don't suppose I could watch. 
PATTERSON (delighted) Might be exciting for you. 
STARLING I've never been all that adventurous. I wouldn't be in the way? 
PATTERSON I'd love the company. And I've hunted all my life. 
STARLING (gathering courage) Well, why not? You seem so calm and experienced. (standing, teacup in hand) Why not, indeed! (Now from that-) 
CUT TO 
A SLIGHTLY WOUNDED DONKEY 
It's roped loosely to a tree, bells around its neck. When it moves, they make a sound. Middle of the night. A night wind. 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL 
We're in a clearing with thick trees all around. 
KEEP PULLING BACK TO REVEAL 
PATTERSON AND STARLING, seated uncomfortably in a tree on the edge of the clearing, twelve feet up in the air. Patterson has his rifle ready. This next is all whispered. 
STARLING (embarrassed) I hate to be a bother, John, but the cramp's getting worse. (Pulls up his trousers- his leg is knotted) The pain is actually quite unbearable now. 
PATTERSON Shhh. 
STARLING I'm sure you mean that to be comforting, but- 
PATTERSON (interrupting) -you'll have to deal with it, Nigel. 
STARLING That is precisely my plan- but back in my tent. (And he begins to climb down) 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON, grabbing him. 
PATTERSON They own the night- nobody moves when there's a man-eater out there. 
Starling glumly obeys. Then- 
STARLING John? I know this isn't the time to ask, but- 
PATTERSON What? 
STARLING Since you'd only been here three hours when we met, are you sure this is how you hunt lions? 
PATTERSON Not to terrify you, Nigel, but it's worse than you think- I've never even seen one. 
CUT TO 
STARLING, not pleased with this news. He massages his calf, tries to get comfortable, which is impossible. Patterson just stares at the night. 
CUT TO 
JUST BEFORE DAWN 
The donkey dozes. So does Starling. Patterson has not so much as moved. 
Now the bushes behind the donkey shake just a little. 
And the donkey is suddenly awake and scared- 
-and then it all goes crazy- the donkey screams and a lion appears from the bushes and Patterson fires one shot and the sound EXPLODES- 
-and Starling topples from the tree to the ground, landing shocked but unhurt- 
-he has landed close to the dead lion- he stares at it. 
STARLING (amazed) ...one shot... 
PATTERSON (even more amazed) So that's what a lion looks like. (Now from the tree-) 
CUT TO 
THE HOSPITAL TENT AREA - JUST AFTER DAWN 
HOLD for a moment. 
SAMUEL (over) One shot- one- 
KEEP HOLDING 
Now Samuel comes walking into the shot, really excited- 
-it's the first time we've seen his wonderful smile. 
SAMUEL Patterson has made the nights safe again. 
KEEP HOLDING FOR JUST A MOMENT MORE. 
As he walks on, behind him come THREE COOLIES carrying the body of the lion. As dozens of men come running in from all over to see the dead man-eater- 
SAMUEL (mimes shooting) BOOM! (Now as the crowd continues to grow-) 
CUT TO 
A ROUGH ENGINEER'S DRAWING OF WHAT WILL BE THE BRIDGE 
It has two embankments on either side of the river. 
PATTERSON, as the wind continues to blow. He continues to stare at the spot where the pattern stopped. 
CUT TO 
SINGH. As before. Except for one thing: suddenly, he begins to shiver, as if from cold. 
CUT TO 
THE BUILDING SEQUENCE 
And what we see are a lot of cuts of a lot of activity. 
Huge wooden logs are carried in and hammered to each other and driven deep into the ground- the framework for the embankments. 
And Singh carries the heaviest loads and leads the workers- and as the structure rises, he is the one darting along the top, high in the air, pulling more logs up, helping here, helping there. 
And alongside him is his assistant, ABDULLAH, a little man with glasses and very bright eyes. 
Meanwhile, Starling is leading construction on the embankment that is on the far side of the river. And he does his best, tries to help on the top part as it rises- but alas, he is a bit on the clumsy side and balance is a problem for him. But he stays with it, does well. 
And Patterson, in tremendous spirits, helps when needed, but mostly he is dealing with other aspects of the bridge- such as the placements of the three stone foundation pillars- 
-he wades into the water, climbs the structures, takes it all in- and at the start he is still in the uniform he has worn since the start of the story- but it's clumsy for labor- 
-so he changes halfway through to civilian clothes- 
-which is all he wears from now on. 
And the workers tire in the heat- but Singh keeps them going, working with the power of three- 
-and there are accidents and explosions, injuries and falls- and Hawthorne appears when needed to help with the wounded- 
-it's hard, brutal work- 
-but gradually, the wooden structure part is finished- two huge skeletons facing each other across the Tsavo River- and now work on the roadbed is going full blast and in the river, the three foundation pillars are taking shape- 
CUT TO 
TONS OF RED ROCK- being shoved into the wooden skeleton to complete the embankments. As this goes on- 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON AND SAMUEL in the river- the foundation pillar work is going very quickly. 
Patterson stops working, looks across the river- 
-movement in the grassy area on the far side. 
CUT TO 
SEVERAL NANDI TRIBESMEN as they rise out of the grass, gesture to Samuel who gestures back. The Nandi are a tribe of powerful little men, primitive, with teeth that have been sharpened to points. 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON AND SAMUEL watching them. 
PATTERSON What are they looking at? 
SAMUEL You- they cannot believe you're still here. 
PATTERSON Nonsense. 
SAMUEL You don't know what Tsavo means, do you? (Patterson doesn't) It means "slaughter"... 
CUT TO 
THE NANDI TRIBESMEN, staring at Patterson, shaking their heads. 
CUT TO 
THE TWO EMBANKMENTS, as more and more red rock is shoved and pushed into shape. 
CUT TO 
THE THREE FOUNDATION PILLARS- almost finished. 
CUT TO 
THE ROADBED. The same. 
CUT TO 
THE NEAR EMBANKMENT as still more rock is forced in and 
CUT TO 
THE FAR EMBANKMENT done at last- 
CUT TO 
-and Singh stands on the top of the near one while across the river, Patterson pulls Starling to the top of the other. 
And they all look at each other- the embankments are both finished- THE THREE OF THEM are flying- 
-and what they do is this: hold their hands out toward each other, in Singh's gesture. It's kind of become their password. 
HOLD. A big moment for them all! 
CUT TO 
SINGH'S TENT AREA 
He sits around a fire and the man is exhausted. His dinner plate is beside him, untouched. He's too tired to eat. 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON'S TENT AREA 
Starling is there, getting ready for bed. He's wiped out, too. 
CUT TO 
SINGH, going into his tent, lying down, breathing deep. 
CUT TO 
STARLING I am immune to your disdain. (He looks at them now) When I came here, I had but one small goal: to convert the entire continent of Africa. (shakes his head) Now I've decided to move on to something really difficult: I will not rest until both of you are safely in the fold. 
SAMUEL I've had four wives, good luck. 
STARLING The struggle is the glory... (HOLD ON the three friends) 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON, the next morning, working with Abdullah and some others at the bridge. 
CUT TO 
STARLING completing work on the fence from the day before. It's high and taut and he's done a terrific job. 
CUT TO 
TSAVO STATION 
A BUNCH OF OTHER MEN are working near a large grassy field. One of the men starts a chant. The others pick it up. It's really pretty. 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON wading into the river- he stops as the sound of the chant comes distantly to him on the wind. 
CUT TO 
THE WORKMEN CHANTING LOUDER. It's turning into a stunner of a day- glorious blue sky broken up by pale clouds. 
CUT TO 
STARLING. Pauses briefly, listening to the sound of the men. 
CUT TO 
THE MEN WORKING AND SINGING. As before. 
CUT TO 
THE GRASSY FIELD. As before- 
-except it isn't. Because if you looked carefully, something flicked in a 180 degree arc. No telling what it was, it was gone too quickly. 
CUT TO 
THE MEN WORKING, SINGING ON. 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON waist deep in the river, listening to the sound of the men, of the birds. The sun is higher in the sky. 
CUT TO 
THE GRASSY FIELD- 
-and here it comes again, only the other way this time, flicking back in another 180 degree arc- 
-still hard to tell for sure what it was but maybe it was this: a tail. Now quickly- 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON wading out of the river as Samuel comes into view. He holds an envelope. 
SAMUEL For you. 
PATTERSON (taking it) Thank you, Samuel. 
SAMUEL (watching as Patterson opens it) Good news? 
PATTERSON (glancing at the letter) I expect so- it's from my wife. 
SAMUEL Do you love her? 
PATTERSON I do, actually; very much. 
SAMUEL (his wonderful smile) You give me hope, John. (As he walks away-) 
CUT TO 
STARLING, probing at the thorn fence, searching out any last weaknesses. 
Behind him now, in the tall grass, something moves. 
Starling, intent on his work, notices nothing. 
CUT TO 
THE SINGING MEN, getting more and more into it. 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON, by the river, reading the letter. 
There is a large tree up the riverbank. It casts a large shadow. 
In the shadow now, something moves. 
Patterson, intent on his reading, notices nothing. 
HELENA (over) Darling one- the big excitement yesterday was when some school- children spotted a whale- (pause) -they were looking at me, John- 
CUT TO 
HELENA, in their bedroom, moving across to the window, staring out. She now has a considerable stomach. 
HELENA That was an attempt at humor but I don't feel very funny these days. I miss you terribly and after our son- I still have total confidence- well, after he's born I think travel might be broadening. As he kicks me at night I'm quite sure he's telling me he definitely wants to come to Africa. (pause) Thought you might need reminding. 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON by the river. He smiles, folds the letter. Now- 
CUT TO 
THE SINGING WORKMEN at Tsavo station- and they sense how good they sound, and they really concentrate on it, on making that sound even better- 
-there must be twenty of them, working and singing- 
CUT TO 
STARLING, doing the same and 
CUT TO 
THE WHITE LION, growling louder and 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON, taking aim and 
CUT TO 
SAMUEL, crying out and pointing and suddenly we're into super slow motion- 
-Samuel has pointed back toward the roof of the shed and- 
-and this thing is suddenly there- 
-this huge dark thing and it seems to suddenly appear from the flat roof of the shed and 
CUT TO 
THE SUN, blocked out as this dark thing moves across it, fully stretched, it seems to go on forever and 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON, turning around to see and 
CUT TO 
STARLING, turning too, and we're coming back into regular motion now as we 
CUT TO 
This enormous BLACK-MANED LION diving into the three, sending them all sprawling and 
CUT TO 
THE WHITE MANED LION roaring and 
CUT TO 
THE BLACK MANED LION roaring, running to the other and 
CUT TO 
THE TWO LIONS IN CLOSE UP. 
THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS, for that is how they will be referred to- 
-and The Ghost has blood and bits of flesh on its mouth- 
-The Darkness has eyes that are crazed- 
-they are destruction bringers, these two, they can kill the old and the young and the fat and the strong- 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON, lying in pain, dazed, shoulder bleeding, trying to reach for his rifle and 
CUT TO 
THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS, the white and the black, as they move toward the field of tall grass, roaring and 
CUT TO 
SAMUEL, lying in pain, his leg is bleeding and 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON'S RIFLE and 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON, as he reaches it, manages to lift it and the roaring sounds are deafening now and 
CUT TO 
THE TWO GIGANTIC MALES, backing into the tall grass- 
-they roar one final time- 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON, gun ready to fire but it's futile and he knows it as we 
CUT TO 
THE TALL GRASS and they're gone, the grass is full of moving patterns from the wind- that's all we see- just the grass blowing this way, that way- 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON, staggering to his feet, staring at the grassy field. 
PATTERSON (dazed) Jesus, two of them... 
CUT TO 
SAMUEL. Dazed too. He points. Patterson registers, turns and 
CUT TO 
STARLING, LYING DEAD, his throat ripped open. HOLD briefly on the young man, then- 
CUT TO 
THE STATION AREA 
A train from Mombassa is slowly pulling in. And things are fairly chaotic- there is the usual activity of what is ordinarily one of the busier parts in camp- 
-but now, something new has been added: Abdullah is there with several dozen coolies who work under his command. THey are waiting for the train. 
Patterson and Samuel are there too- and at the moment, Abdullah and Patterson are in the middle of a screamer- first one of them walking away, then coming back, then the other doing the same. 
CUT TO 
HALF A DOZEN NATIVES CARRYING STARLING'S COFFIN. They start to put it on the train and as they do- 
CUT TO 
BEAUMONT. Stunned. And furious! He storms off the train and we- 
CUT TO 
THE BRIDGE 
as Beaumont sees it. Patterson and Samuel are with him. 
Little more work has been done than the last time we saw it. A few men are working slowly. 
And now there are guards with rifles patrolling it. 
CUT TO 
BEAUMONT. A deadly look at them. He storms off. 
CUT TO 
THE HOSPITAL 
as Beaumont sees it- Patterson, Samuel, and Hawthorne stand quietly. 
It's much more crowded than the last time. Still under control, but barely. 
Beaumont is icy now. He gestures sharply toward Hawthrone to join them. 
CUT TO 
OUTSIDE THE HOSPITAL 
THE FOUR MEN speak low and fast- 
BEAUMONT What in hell is going on? 
SAMUEL The Ghost and The Darkness have come. 
BEAUMONT (snapping) In English. 
PATTERSON It's what the natives are calling the lions- (beat) -two lions have been causing trouble- 
BEAUMONT -what's the surprise in that, this is Africa? 
PATTERSON It hasn't been that simple so far. 
BEAUMONT What have they done besides kill Starling? (beat) How many have they killed? (Patterson nods for Hawthorne to answer) 
CUT TO 
HAWTHORNE. Doing his best. 
HAWTHORNE Well, of course, I can't supply a totally accurate answer because there are those that are actually authenticated and there are those that we once thought were workers killing each other or deserting from camp so any number I give is subject to error- 
BEAUMONT (cutting through) How many? 
HAWTHORNE Thirty, I should think. 
BEAUMONT (stunned) Christ! (whirling on Patterson) What are you doing about it? (Now from there-) 
CUT TO 
SOMETHING VERY ODD: 
We are looking at a small railroad car in a deserted area. This is not near the track but off by itself, in an area surrounded by thorn trees. 
Several workers are erecting a cloth tent to cover it, trying to disguise the fact that the small railroad car is, indeed, nothing but a small railroad car. 
It is difficult work and they are perspiring heavily. 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL 
PATTERSON AND BEAUMONT looking at it. 
BEAUMONT This is supposed to be salvation? (staring at Patterson) What kind of idiocy are we dealing with here? 
PATTERSON (keeping control) I'm calling it my "contraption"- we're going to surround it with a boma- a fence, to you- and we're going to leave a small opening opposite that door. 
CUT TO 
THE RAILROAD CAR. There is, in fact, an open front door. Patterson gestures for Beaumont to follow him inside. 
CUT TO 
INSIDE THE CAR AS THEY ENTER. It has been divided in half by thick metal bars from floor to ceiling. The bars are close together, only a few inches between them. 
PATTERSON In that half will be bait- human bait- I'll start things off- (points to the open doorway) -a sliding door will fit above that and a trip wire will run across the floor. 
BEAUMONT (The smile is back) Genius- the beast will enter, tripping the wire, the door will slide down, trapping him, you, safe behind the bars, will have him at your mercy and will shoot him. 
Patterson nods. Beaumont explodes. 
BEAUMONT Are you running a high fever, man? How could you expect something as lunatic as this to succeed? How could you even conceive of it? 
PATTERSON I didn't conceive of it for the lions- I built one in India when there was trouble with a tiger. 
BEAUMONT (incredulous) And it worked? 
PATTERSON (He hates to say this) In point of fact, it didn't. (hurrying on) But I'm convinced the theory is sound. 
CUT TO 
THE TWO OF THEM. They move outside. The tension between them is considerable. Beaumont looks at Patterson for too long a moment. 
PATTERSON What? 
BEAUMONT I made a mistake hiring you- you're simply not up to the job. (Silence. Then-) 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON. CLOSE UP. 
Patterson stands where The Darkness was. The three Coolies are where they spent the night, on the other side of the bars. 
This was the lowest point yet for Patterson. Not only had his notion come so close to working, he could never fully comprehend how the coolies missed. It never seemed possible- but of course, it really happened. 
PATTERSON Not once?- you didn't hit it once?- 
MIDDLE COOLIE -I would never make excuses- but a fire broke out- the light was bad- he kept moving- 
PATTERSON -well, of course he kept moving- but he couldn't have been more than ten feet away from the three of you- surely you must have wounded the thing- 
MIDDLE COOLIE I assure you we came close many times- 
Abdullah is in the doorway near Patterson now- with several dozen men. And from Abdullah's face, this is clearly going to be a confrontation. 
MIDDLE COOLIE -the next time we will do better. (Patterson makes no reaction; moves outside) 
CUT TO 
ABDULLAH, simmering, moving straight to Patterson as soon as he's out. 
ABDULLAH The next time will be as this time- The Devil has come to Tsavo- 
PATTERSON (not in a mood for this) -that's ridiculous talk and you can't seriously believe it- 
ABDULLAH (moving in- tension rising as others crowd behind him) -now you're telling me my beliefs?- I don't think so- 
CUT TO 
THE BUSH just beyond- something is moving- an animal?- Impossible to say. 
PATTERSON I wasn't and you know it and don't push it- just listen- we have a problem in Tsavo- 
ABDULLAH (cutting in) -at last you're right- we do- you are the problem in Tsavo- 
PATTERSON -careful, Abdullah- 
Patterson and Abdullah and suddenly it's dangerous. 
ABDULLAH You do not tell me "careful"- you do not tell me anything- you listen while I talk- (Now suddenly a shadow seems to cross-) 
CUT TO 
ABDULLAH. CLOSE UP. His eyes widen. 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL 
AN ENORMOUS PISTOL. Pressed hard against Abdullah's temple. 
MAN'S VOICE (over) -change in plan- you listen while I talk- because you have a question that needs answering. (beat) Will I pull the trigger? 
PULL BACK FURTHER TO REVEAL 
REDBEARD. 
We are looking at one of those legends- ageless and powerful, with a tanned face and a thick grey beard. He has seen everything and is capable of anything. 
Just now he seems more than capable of killing Abdullah. Very calmly, he cocks the pistol. 
SAMUEL (over) It's Redbeard, Abdullah- he'll kill you. 
REDBEARD (not looking around) No hints, Samuel. 
ABDULLAH (The name has registered) You don't know all that has happened here- the Devil has come to Tsavo. 
REDBEARD You're right. The Devil has come. Look at me. I am the Devil. 
CUT TO 
ABDULLAH, staring at Redbeard. Right now Redbeard just could be. 
ABDULLAH (louder) I am a man of peace. 
REDBEARD Am I to take it you want to live? 
ABDULLAH Most certainly. Absolutely. Yes. 
REDBEARD Excellent decision. (Now he suddenly reaches out, shakes Abdullah's hand) Your name is Abdullah? I'm sure we'll meet again. Go and enjoy the splendid morning. 
ABDULLAH (dazed- leaving) I think it's been a pleasure. 
CUT TO 
REDBEARD, and now he does another surprising thing: embraces Samuel. 
REDBEARD (three words) You got old. (Now he releases Samuel, turns to Patterson) I'm sure you're John Patterson. (before Patterson can reply) Stay out of my way. (And without another word, he's gone) 
CUT TO 
THE HOSPITAL 
as Redbeard moves through, taking it all in. It's even worse than when we last saw it- bodies crammed everywhere and always the sound of pain and sickness. 
Patterson stands in the doorway, watching, waiting. 
PATTERSON (as Redbeard approaches) I didn't have a chance to thank you. 
REDBEARD (preoccupied) What did I do? 
PATTERSON Got me out of trouble. 
REDBEARD (matter of fact) Nonsense- Samuel would have done something. (starts to move on) 
PATTERSON We need to talk. 
REDBEARD Let me save time- (1) you are the engineer; (2) you are in charge; (3) you're sorry I'm here. Right so far? (Patterson nods) Good- because (1) I am not an engineer, (2) I don't want to be in charge, and (3) I'm sorrier than you are that I'm here- I hate Tsavo. So I will help you by killing the lions and leaving, and you will help me by doing what I tell you so I can leave. See any problems? 
PATTERSON Actually, no. 
REDBEARD All right- let's go into battle. (suddenly taking Patterson's hand) I'm Redbeard. (as they shake) 
PATTERSON Somehow I guessed. (As they move outside-) 
CUT TO 
THE FRONT OF THE HOSPITAL 
REDBEARD VOICE (over) I'll need you by me in the morning. 
SAMUEL VOICE (over) Whatever you wish. 
CUT TO 
WHERE WE ARE- IT'S PATTERSON'S TENT AREA. Patterson, Redbeard, Hawthorne, and Samuel sit around a fire. 
THey are cleaning their guns, getting ready. 
A WORD ABOUT THEIR WEAPONS. Patterson's is a good rifle and he cleans it expertly. 
Redbeard's surprisingly, is the oldest. And the way his hands move as he assembles it, he might be bathing a child. 
Hawthorne is the least skilled of the three. But his rifle is clearly the finest. Bigger than the others, with great killing power. 
There is a tremendous tension- Patterson, Hawthorne, and Samuel show it. Redbeard is as before. 
HAWTHORNE (terribly tense) You're certain about tomorrow? (Redbeard is) But you don't seem excited. (Redbeard isn't) 
PATTERSON You don't enjoy killing, do you? (Redbeard doesn't) 
HAWTHORNE Then why do it? 
CUT TO 
REDBEARD. CLOSE UP. He stares at the fire. Then- 
REDBEARD I have a gift. 
CUT TO 
THE CAMPFIRE. Silence for a moment except for the sound of the weapons being reassembled. Redbeard's hands fly. His rifle is back together. He stands, nods, goes. 
CUT TO 
HAWTHORNE, watching him. 
HAWTHORNE Strange man. (to Samuel) Has he always been this way? 
SAMUEL Much gentler now. 
HAWTHORNE (shakes his head on that) John?- (He holds out his beautiful rifle) Change guns with me- mine's much more powerful. I'll be finishing the hospital tomorrow so I won't be with you- but if you'll use this... (beat) ...then I will. 
Patterson, touched, changes weapons. 
PATTERSON Thank you. (He turns to Samuel) Why does he need you by him? 
SAMUEL He doesn't. He needs nobody. But we have hunted many times... (beat) ...he knows I am afraid of lions... 
HOLD ON THE FIRELIGHT UNTIL WE SHARPLY- 
CUT TO 
THE BRIDGE. BEFORE DAWN. 
Misty- hard to see much. 
Then GHOSTS appear- 
KEEP HOLDING 
-they're not ghosts, they're MASAI WARRIORS emerging from the mists. They are powerful and painted and they carry noisemaking equipment- tin cans and tom toms and as more and more of them materialize- 
CUT TO 
A HUGE THICKET. 
Redbeard, Patterson, and Samuel wait as the Warriors approach. 
REDBEARD (whispered) I spotted one of them- (gesturing toward the thicket) -in there. 
CUT TO 
THE THICKET again- alive with thorn trees. Dark, filled with long dark shadows. 
CUT TO 
REDBEARD AND PATTERSON AND SAMUEL. A lot of tension. 
REDBEARD The best way to ensure the kill when you're using trackers is for one to shoot while the other uses the trackers to force the lion toward the shooter. Have you ever led trackers? 
PATTERSON (He hasn't) I can try. 
REDBEARD (no good) Samuel says you killed a lion. 
PATTERSON It was probably luck- I'd rather you did the shooting. 
REDBEARD You'd never force the lion to me- and nobody ever got a lion with one shot by luck. (points- hand out straight) Around there's a clearing- you'll know it from the anthills- get there and hide and listen to the sounds- I'll make the lion come directly to you. (He gestures for Patterson to take off and as he does-) 
CUT TO 
THE WARRIORS as Redbeard goes to them- 
REDBEARD (as Samuel translates) -all of you- spread the width of the clearing- no gaps- go- (claps his hands once) 
CUT TO 
THE WARRIORS, spreading apart. 
CUT TO 
THE SUN. Starting to appear more strongly on the horizon. 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON, running like hell. 
CUT TO 
THE WARRIORS, moving quickly, silently. 
CUT TO 
A THICK CLUSTER 0F THORN TREES. 
CUT TO 
REDBEARD- starting to suddenly get louder and point- 
-because something is there- 
CUT BACK TO 
THE THICKET AHEAD, and we didn't see it before, only Redbeard saw it before- 
-but now something begins to move and 
CUT TO 
REDBEARD AND THE WARRIORS and it's all going crazy now, and they're starting to move faster and 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON IN THE SHADOW. 
The noise has kicked up and all the time it's coming closer and 
CUT TO 
REDBEARD AND THE WARRIORS and the movement up ahead is more distinct and the Warriors are almost in a frenzy as we 
CUT TO 
A FLASH OF THE GHOST IN THE THICKET- eyes bright- it starts to move away from the sound- 
-and toward where Patterson is waiting. 
CUT TO 
REDBEARD. Faster, screaming louder and 
CUT TO 
SAMUEL and the fear starting to leave and he screams louder too and 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON- he fingers the weapon. 
CUT TO 
THE GHOST, angrily retreating faster from the sound- and now instead of going straight back it begins to veer left and 
CUT TO 
REDBEARD, immediately spotting the shift, gesturingto the Warriors to get left and 
CUT TO 
THE WARRIORS, shifting over as Redbeard directed, blocking The Ghost's intended path and 
CUT TO 
THE GHOST, shifting, trying to go the other way this time and 
CUT TO 
REDBEARD; he spots that too, gestures for the Warriors to shift the other way and 
CUT TO 
THE WARRIORS, racing to thier new positions, blocking the animal's path again and 
CUT TO 
THE GHOST, rattled, upset, and now it starts retreating back in the original direction- toward Patterson and 
CUT TO 
REDBEARD AND THE WHOLE LONG LINE OF MEN, and it's as if mass hysteria has gripped them, because their sound keeps building and sure, their throats must ache and yes, their arms must tire, but you couldn't tell that from what they're doing- 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON. Waiting by the anthill. Waiting. Then, at last- 
CUT TO 
THE GHOST, backing into view, staring back at the sound, unaware of Patterson's existence behind him. 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON. Noiselessly he steps away from the anthill into the sunlight. He raises Hawthorne's gun. 
CUT TO 
THE GHOST, backing toward Patterson. 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON, sighting along the glistening barrel. 
CUT TO 
THE GHOST, starting to turn. 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON, ready to fire. 
CUT TO 
THE GHOST IN CLOSE UP, CAUGHT IN THE CROSSHAIRS OF THE RIFLE. And now its lips go back as it sees Patterson. 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON, CLOSE UP, and this is it, this is the moment and as he squeezes the trigger- 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON AND THE GHOST, and a totally unexpected sound- a dull snap- Hawthorne's rifle has misfired. 
Redbeard and Patterson have buckets which they empty around the inside perimeter- 
-buckets of blood. 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON AND REDBEARD. Darker. They empty still more full buckets of blood. Redbeard seems pleased. 
CUT TO 
SAMUEL AND HAWTHORNE, hurrying toward their camp. 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON AND REDBEARD, leading Masai cattle into the grounds of the Old Hospital. 
CUT TO 
THE ORDERLIES IN THE NEW HOSPITAL, firmly closing and locking the gate. 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON AND REDBEARD, just outside the fence of the Old Hospital- they carry many large chunks of raw meat, drop them as they move. 
CUT TO 
THE SUN. Dying... dying... 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON AND REDBEARD. They slip inside the deserted Old Hospital, pull the gate securely shut. 
CUT TO 
THE CATTLE. They stand in the center of the Old Hospital, calling to each other. 
CUT TO 
THE NEW HOSPITAL. Full. Clean. The men are exhausted. Most are already asleep. The Orderlies sit by a fire, alert for anything. 
CUT TO 
THE OLD HOSPITAL. Patterson and Redbeard stand across from their fire, waiting. The cows are quiet. 
CUT TO 
HAWTHORNE by his fire near his tent with Samuel. Nervously, they drink tea. 
CUT TO 
THE MOON. Higher. An hour has passed. Perhaps more. 
CUT TO 
REDBEARD. Walking the fence perimeter. 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON. The cows are edgy. He calms the cows. 
CUT TO 
OUTSIDE THE OLD HOSPITAL. The large chunks of meat are visible in the moonlight. 
CUT TO 
THE NEW HOSPITAL. The orderlies are calm. 
CUT TO 
REDBEARD, still walking the perimeter. 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON sitting by the fire, staring at the night. Redbeard moves to him, speaks in a whisper. 
REDBEARD Think about something else. 
PATTERSON Have you ever failed? 
REDBEARD (sad smile) Only in life... (He walks away. Patterson watches.) 
CUT TO 
THE NEW HOSPITAL. The Orderlies tend the sick. Quietly. 
CUT TO 
THE NIGHT AND THE MOON. Lovely. 
CUT TO 
REDBEARD. Stalking the perimeter. No sound. The night is deadly quiet. 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON. He stalks the perimeter now too, on the far side from Redbeard- and suddenly a different and frightening sound- the ripping of flesh- 
CAMERA MOVES UP 
Now we can see both Patterson inside and also outside where, in shadow, The Ghost and The Darkness are devouring a hunk of meat. 
Redbeard moves quickly across the perimeter, gestures for Patterson to switch positions with him. 
As he reaches where Patterson was, the eating sound stops. 
Silence again. 
Patterson reaches the far side of the fence. 
Now the eating sound comes again, and again, BOTH LIONS are outside, directly across from Patterson. 
CUT TO 
REDBEARD looks across the perimeter at Patterson. Whatever's going on, it's sure as hell odd. 
CUT TO 
A SECOND TENT, as it starts to collapse and 
CUT TO 
THE MEDICINE TENT, as The Ghost and The Darkness enter and 
CUT TO 
MEDICINE, flying across the tent and 
CUT TO 
GLASS, shattering and more medicine is destroyed and 
CUT TO 
A BLIZZARD OF CUTS, of lions' claws and lions' teeth and those terrible bright blazing eyes and 
CUT TO 
A TENT POLE, being pulled out of the ground and 
CUT TO 
THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS and what they are doing is this: destroying the New Hospital and 
CUT TO 
MORE TENTS collapsing and 
CUT TO 
THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS. CLOSE UP. Eyes crazed. 
CUT TO 
HAWTHORNE ALONE IN THE NIGHT, scared shitless as he runs. 
CUT TO 
SHADOWS, moving, as Hawthorne's torch lights the surroundings and 
CUT TO 
HAWTHORNE, heart pounding, looking around and then he gasps as we 
CUT TO 
THE AREA NEARBY- TWO LARGE EYES are staring at him. 
CUT TO 
HAWTHORNE, panicked, stumbling, falling, getting up, staring around- 
CUT TO 
THE AREA AROUND HIM- the eys are gone- 
-and now there are loud shrieks in the night coming from the New Hospital and the instant they are heard 
CUT TO 
REDBEARD AND PATTERSON, grabbing torches, throwing the gate open and they're off as we 
CUT TO 
HAWTHORNE, running toward the New Hospital just up ahead now. 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON AND REDBEARD, tearing through the night. 
CUT TO 
THE NEW HOSPITAL. (We see all this next through Hawthorne's eyes.) The tents are all down. The place is devastated. 
CUT TO 
INSIDE THE FIRST TENT. Filled with the dead and the dying. 
CUT TO 
HAWTHORNE. Ashen. Moving on. 
CUT TO 
PAN ALONG THE TENT 
Dead. Blood. Pain. 
PAN TO THE SECOND TENT 
More dead. 
More dying. 
It's a slaughterhouse. 
CUT TO 
HAWTHORNE. He's crushed. His body sags. He takes a breath, his last. 
THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS are on him, roaring. 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON AND REDBEARD as the roar reverberates- they glance at each other- 
-then they slow. 
Because the New Hospital has come into view. 
CUT TO 
CUT TO 
A RAVINE. They are moving along the edge. It's tricky going- if you fell you wouldn't much like it. They are both concentrating on their movements, paying no attention to each other as Redbeard starts to speak. They don't stop moving. 
REDBEARD In my town, when I was little, there was a brute, a bully who terrorized the place. (beat) But he was not the problem. He had a brother who was worse than he. But the brother was not the problem. (beat) One or the other of them was usually in jail. The problem came when they were both free togther. The two became different from either alone. (beat) Alone they were only brutes. Together they became lethal, together they killed. 
PATTERSON What happened to them? 
REDBEARD (pause) I got big. (They move on) 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON AND REDBEARD working their way up a steep ravine. It's hard going. They help each other. 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON AND REDBEARD, moving along the edge of the ravine now. Slow. Silent. Redbeard stops, points- 
CUT TO 
A TANGLE IN THE BUSHES AND THORNS with one odd thing about it: there is a clearly defined archway, as if a buffalo or rhino used it as a regular passage. 
CUT TO 
THE TWO OF THEM at the archway. They look at each other, without a word move through it. 
CUT TO 
THE OTHER SIDE. A small clearing. And at the end of the clearing: a cave. 
CUT TO 
THE CAVE MOUTH. Dark. 
CUT TO 
REDBEARD AND PATTERSON. They each check their guns, move toward it. 
CUT TO 
THE CAVE MOUTH. Closer. Suddenly it's getting eerie. 
CUT TO 
REDBEARD, moving slowly, Patterson right with him. 
CUT TO 
THE CAVE MOUTH. They're by it- Redbeard squints inside. 
CUT TO 
WHAT HE SEES: it's dark and dangerous and there is a long low tunnel you have to half-crawl through. 
Without a word, they start inside. 
CUT TO 
REDBEARD AND PATTERSON, crouched low, moving through the tunnel. Ahead there is light. They move on. 
CUT TO 
THE END OF THE TUNNEL- they can see the cave beyond. 
CUT TO 
REDBEARD AND PATTERSON. They glance down. Nothing much there- just a copper bracelet, the kind a native might wear. 
Now they move past it and as the tunnel ends, they stand up. 
CUT TO 
INSIDE THE CAVE - IT'S BIG. 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON AND REDBEARD, moving deeper into the cave. It's scary- dark with shafts of light coming from cracks in the rock. It's dank. It all feels as at any moment, the world could end. 
CUT TO 
REDBEARD. CLOSE UP. Thunderstruck- 
REDBEARD Dear God- (And on those words-) 
CUT TO 
THE FLOOR OF THE CAVE. More copper bracelets. And still more- 
-and now bones- 
-the floor of the place is littered with human bones- 
-eyeless skulls peer up at them from all around. 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL 
The rest of the cave. We are looking at a carpet of bones. 
PATTERSON Their den? (Redbeard nods) Have you ever seen anything like this? 
REDBEARD Nobody's seen anything like this. Lions don't have caves like this- (beat) -they're doing it for pleasure. 
CUT TO 
SEVERAL TUNNELS, dark and ominous, leading from the cave- 
-and now there is a sound from one of the tunnels- 
-something is coming close and coming fast and 
CUT TO 
REDBEARD AND PATTERSON as Redbeard fires into the tunnel and the sound explodes- 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON I'll be bait alone? 
REDBEARD Yes. And I'll be in some distant tree where I can provide no assistance whatsoever. (beat) Can you control your fear? 
PATTERSON I'll have to. 
REDBEARD I can't control mine- I'd be lost without the shame factor driving me. 
PATTERSON Was that supposed to make me feel better? (Redbeard doesn't reply. Now-) 
CUT TO 
A DONKEY BEING LED IN. LATER. 
THE MEN start to tie it down, across the clearing from the machan. 
Patterson takes a long look at the machan. He tests the support poles- they're rickety. 
CUT TO 
DUSK. The sun quickly beginning its quick fall. 
CUT TO 
THE WATER TOWER IN THE STATION AREA. Samuel is with the remaining men who clamber up to the platform on top. 
CUT TO 
THE DONKEY IN THE CLEARING. Quiet. 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL 
Redbeard, holding a wooden ladder that is propped against the plank. Patterson climbs his slow way up. It's dangerous. 
CUT TO 
THE PLANK as Patterson makes it, clambers off the ladder, manages to sit. 
CUT TO 
THE VIEW. Nothing is around the machan. He is totally vulnerable. 
CUT TO 
REDBEARD, taking the ladder down. Patterson tries to get comfortable. He can't. 
REDBEARD (glancing around) It's certainly the best chance they've had to kill you. 
PATTERSON You think they'll come then? (Redbeard does) Why? 
REDBEARD (not answering) Good luck. 
PATTERSON Why? 
REDBEARD (beat) Because I think they're after you. 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON. This registers. Finally, he nods. Redbeard starts to leave. 
PATTERSON How many do you think they've killed? 
REDBEARD (reluctantly) The most of any lions... a hundred...? (beat) Probably more. (Now Redbeard looks up at the younger man) Johnny...? 
They study each other in the gathering darkness. They've been through a lot together, these two. They're not what they were when they first met. An emotional moment clearly is at hand. 
REDBEARD Don't fuck up. (And he turns, never looks back, just goes) 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON. He is alone now. 
CUT TO 
SHADOWS. Growing longer. 
CUT TO 
SAMUEL. On top of the water tower. The remaining men are with him. 
CUT TO 
THE DONKEY. It peers around. 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON. His fingers move slowly along his rifle barrel- 
-there is no noise- but you have the sense that, at any second, the world could explode. 
CUT TO 
THE EDGE OF THE CLEARING, a good distance away. A bunch of trees. Nothing unusual. 
MOVE IN CLOSER: 
Redbeard, motionless, rifle in hand, is high in the branches. 
CUT TO 
THE SUN. About to die. 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON, trying to get comfortable. It's not possible. 
CUT TO 
THE DONKEY, tethered, but able to move. 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON, testing the machan- not a good idea- it trembles. He stops, stares out at the setting sun, the light hitting his skin, giving it color. 
CUT TO 
CUT TO 
THE EYES OF THE GHOST. NARROWING. 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON. Involuntarily, a shiver. 
CUT TO 
WHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON, but the angle shifts- 
-what's happening of course is this: The Ghost is circling around the platform in the safety of the bushes and the mist. 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON, following the whispered sound of the bushes moving. He half turns the other way quickly, making sure that nothing is behind him. 
CUT TO 
WHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON shifting as the angle continues to change. 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON as the realization hits: the beast doesn't care about the donkey anymore, it's stalking him. 
CUT TO 
REDBEARD. In the tree. The mist obscures everything. 
CUT TO 
WHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON. Still circling, still closer. 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON, and it's scary now, this thing circling and circling, always closer, never visible and his throat is dry and you know he's just dying to blast it with his weapon or scream for it to do anything but this constantly circling movement. (In truth, the lion circled him for two hours, always coming closer, never quite seen.) 
CUT TO 
WHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON, always the circling around. 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON, trying to turn on his shaky plank, trying to never to let the animal's position out of his sight. 
CUT TO 
WHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON. Closer... 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON, staring, staring at the goddamn mist, about to come apart now with the tension as it builds and builds and builds and 
CUT TO 
WHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON. Closer. 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON, gripping his weapon tightly as his head keeps on turning. 
CUT TO 
WHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON. Closer. 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON, suddenly yelling out loud as an owl lands on him- that's right, a goddamn owl landed on him, thinking he was a tree, almost knocking him off the plank and 
CUT TO 
WHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON, starting to slip off the platform and 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON, fighting the owl away, but his balance is going and he's trying not to fall and 
CUT TO 
WHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON, beginning to topple off and 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON, helpless, balance going, going- 
CUT TO 
THE GHOST, starting to charge forward and Christ he can move and as he starts his leap- 
CUT TO 
REDBEARD, racing from the tree to the edge of the clearing, firing his rifle, firing again and 
CUT TO 
THE GHOST, as this incredible roar comes from him, and he spins, lands, and sure, he's been hit but he's gone, back into the bushes and the night has him and 
CUT TO 
SUDDEN DAWN AND PATTERSON AND REDBEARD, running, stopping, staring at the ground- 
CUT TO 
THE GROUND. Blood. 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON AND REDBEARD, moving quickly forward again- 
CUT TO 
THE GROUND. More blood and... 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON Actually, I could have done it much more easily without you, but for whatever reason, I'm glad you came. (They toast each other) 
Samuel, with his own bottle of champagne has wandered over, joins them. 
SAMUEL (drunk) Where do you go next? 
REDBEARD Some Russian princes want to hunt the Himalayas. You? 
SAMUEL Help finish the railroad. 
PATTERSON I want to meet my son- he must be what, two months old? 
They look at the fire a moment. Then- 
SAMUEL Three years I've worked for the railroad. Now I don't know why. It seemed a good idea once. 
PATTERSON I feel the same about the bridge. This country certainly didn't ask for it, doesn't need it. 
REDBEARD Too soon to tell. 
They look at him. 
REDBEARD My life was shaped because someone invented gunpowder. Our lives have crossed because two lions went mad. But what if in the future the three of us do something grand for humanity? Was that worth all the lives? Too soon to tell. 
SAMUEL (drinks) Some mysteries should not have solutions. 
REDBEARD (finishes his bottle, rises, looks at Patterson) Hold your son high. (And he turns, goes to his tent) 
PATTERSON (beat- quietly) He has children? 
SAMUEL (beat- quietly) Once... (HOLD on the two in the firelight. Then-) 
CUT TO 
THE STATION MASTER AT TSAVO STATION, WORKING IN HIS OFFICE. THE NEXT DAY. 
FEMALE VOICE (over) I'd like to see John Patterson, please. (As he looks up-) 
CUT TO 
HELENA standing there in Tsavo; she looks weary from travel, but still lovely. She holds their son in her arms. The kid is adorable. 
HELENA Could you tell him that his wife- (catches herself, smiles) -that his family has come to see him. (On that-) 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON AT THE BRIDGE- Samuel hurries to him with the news- Patterson takes off running and 
CUT TO 
TSAVO STATION and Helena; she holds the sleeping child, walks back and forth along the shaded front of the building, no sound at all but her heels. 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON, running like crazy and up ahead now is the station area. 
CUT TO 
HELENA- and now, in the distance, she sees him and she leaves the building, walks out into the open, smiling and waving excitedly and 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON, excitedly waving back and 
CUT TO 
THE DARKNESS, moving out of the grassy area behind Helena and 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON, suddenly screaming "Get back- back-" 
CUT TO 
HELENA, and she's too far away- his words are lost on the wind- she smiles again, waves again and 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON, screaming now, all he has, "GET BACK" and 
CUT TO 
HELENA, and she still can't make out what he's saying but just the same, she stops and 
CUT TO 
THE DARKNESS, stalking silently, closing on the mother and child. 
CUT TO 
HELENA, and the baby wakes, smiles and 
CUT TO 
THE DARKNESS, starting to run and 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON and now it shows on his face- he's not going to get there, he's never going to get there- 
CUT TO 
HELENA, and at last she knows something is terribly wrong and she turns- 
-but too late, too late as we 
CUT TO 
THE DARKNESS, flying toward her now and 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON, in agony. 
CUT TO 
CUT TO 
A LARGE BABOON. ONE LEG IS TIED TO THE END OF THE BRIDGE. GETTING DARK NOW. 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL 
PATTERSON AND SAMUEL, both armed, climbing the crane tower in use at the bridge, not far from the baboon. 
PATTERSON You're positive lions hate baboons? (Samuel is) Pebbles? (Samuel holds up a bag) Let's get it over with. 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON AND SAMUEL as they reach the crane tower platform, fifteen feet from the baboon. 
They help each other into position. Almost night. 
CUT TO 
THE LARGE BABOON, baring its enormous teeth, shrieking out into the darkness. 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON AND SAMUEL on the platform. Samuel tosses a pebble toward the baboon and the baboon cries out again, not in pain but irritation- 
CUT TO 
THE PLATFORM. PATTERSON AND SAMUEL ARE FLOODED BY MOONLIGHT. IT'S THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. 
They're both tired. Samuel throws another pebble. The baboon cries out. 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON, TENSE, ON THE PLATFORM. MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. 
He's tossing pebbles now as Samuel dozes. Paterson looks wild; only nervous energy is keeping him going now. 
CUT TO 
THE SKY. The moon. Peaceful- then it turns bright yellow and frightening black clouds gather and 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON, blinking, coming hard back to reality because the sky is not yellow nor were there black clouds- he's starting to hallucinate. 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON AND SAMUEL ON THE PLATFORM. 
Samuel is awake now. Patterson stares at the river which is calm. 
CUT TO 
THE RIVER, raging and black and lethal. 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON, hallucinating again. 
CUT TO 
JUST BEFORE DAWN 
and The Darkness suddenly is there, creeping across the bridge toward the shrieking baboon and the instant it appears- 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON. Firing- 
CUT TO 
-THE DARKNESS, and it's hit and it roars and goes down and- 
CUT TO 
-PATTERSON, turning, reaching for Samuel's rifle, grabbing it, turning back, ready to fire again- 
CUT TO 
THE DARKNESS- gone. 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON AND SAMUEL, blinking, looking around. 
PATTERSON Where is it? 
SAMUEL (pointing down) Underneath. (beat) Somewhere. 
CUT TO 
WHERE HE'S POINTING. The superstructure for the bridge- it goes several levels beneath the level where the railroad will run. 
They look at each other- not good news and we find out why when we 
CUT TO 
EARLY MORNING LIGHT. 
Patterson and Samuel climb carefully down from their platform to the railroad level. They reach the railroad level. PAtterson releases the baboon which races away. 
CUT TO 
WHERE THEY ARE. At the end of the bridge where they began construction. The bridge, two thirds finished, stretches away before them. 
CUT TO 
They begin to walk the incomplete bridge... carefully... 
..as they go the look down through the crevices of their level, making sure they miss nothing. 
CUT TO 
SAMUEL. Terrified. Holding his rifle extremely tightly. 
CUT TO 
THE TREE HE'S HEADED FOR, a different one from Samuel's and it's just up ahead and 
CUT TO 
THE DARKNESS, closing and 
CUT TO 
THE TREE, and 
CUT TO 
THE DARKNESS, springing into the air now and 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON, diving for the lowest branch, grabbing hold with both hands, swinging his body up as we 
CUT TO 
THE DARKNESS, barely missing as Patterson gets his body onto the branch and now comes this insane roar and 
CUT TO 
SAMUEL with his rifle, as he climbs higher into his tree. 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON in the next tree, climbing higher, until he's fifteen feet up. 
CUT TO 
THE DARKNESS, on the ground, circling the trunk of Patterson's tree, raging with frustration. 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON, exhausted but it's okay now, he's safe, and as he looks across at the next tree not far away where Samuel is- 
SAMUEL (embarrassed) Afraid of lions. 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON. 
PATTERSON It's all right, Samuel- we all get hit- (Now he shuts up fast and-) 
CUT TO 
THE DARKNESS, as it does this incredible thing- it starts to climb the tree after Patterson. Lions are cats and when they want to climb, up they go and that's what The Darkness is doing now, going up and 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON, and it's terrifying- he reaches for the branch above, climbing higher and 
CUT TO 
THE DARKNESS, climbing higher too and the tree is sturdy but there is a four hundred pound thing rocking it now and 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON, going still higher but the branches are getting thinner and the tree is shaking, and he could fall- 
CUT TO 
THE DARKNESS, climbing on, nothing can stop it- 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON AND THE DARKNESS, together in the tree, and there's no further Patterson can go and it's harder for The Darkness too, but slowly it moves in and 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON, calling out- 
PATTERSON Samuel! (And he gestures for the rifle and the instant he does-) 
CUT TO 
SAMUEL, and he takes the rifle between his two hands and

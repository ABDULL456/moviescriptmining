He crosses to the bookshelf.  He selects a dossier.  We see the title: "The Denton Affair".  He returns to his desk and places it on a bookstand.  He puts on his reading glasses. 
NARRATOR It seemed a fairly ordinary night when Brad Majors and his fiancee Janet Weiss (two young ordinary healthy kids) left Denton that late November evening to visit Dr Everett Scott, ex. tutor and now friend of both of them.  It's true there were dark storm clouds, heavy, black and pendulous, toward which they were driving.  It's true also that the spare tyre they were carrying was badly in need of some air.  But they being normal kids and on a night out, well they were not going to let a storm spoil the events of their evening. 
On a night out. 
He closes the book marking the place. 
Thunder is heard distantly on the sound track. 
NARRATOR It was a night out they were going to remember for a very long time. 
Lighting cracks on the sound track. 
WIPE TO 
19	EXT.	NIGHT 
A windscreen wiper working under strain.  Torrential rain on the windscreen.  BRAD concentrating on visibility.  JANET eating chocolates and listening to the car radio playing an Orson Welles serial - The Shadow. 
A motorcycle roars past them. 
JANET Gosh.  That's the third motorcyclist that's passed us.  They certainly take their lives in their hands.  What with the weather and all. 
BRAD Yes, Janet.  Life's pretty cheap to that type. 
JANET takes another stick of gum. 
Offers BRAD some.  He declines. 
The car slows to a halt. 
JANET What's the matter Brad, darling? 
Headlights on sign reading: "DEAD END". 
BRAD I think we took the wrong fork a few miles back. 
JANET Oh dear!  But then where did the motorcyclists come from? 
BRAD Hmmm ... Well, I guess we will have to turn back.

CUT TO 
39	INT.	HALLWAY	NIGHT 
They arrive at a hallway at the bottom of the stairs.  Another servant, MAGENTA, who bears a striking physical resemblance to RIFF RAFF is vacuuming the stairs. 
RIFF RAFF This way. 
JANET steps over the vacuum lead. 
JANET Are you - giving a party? 
RIFF RAFF No.  You've arrived on a rather special night.  It's one of the master's affairs. 
JANET Oh, lucky him. 
MAGENTA He's lucky. 
BRAD and JANET look at MAGENTA, surprised by her voice. 
MAGENTA You're lucky, I'm lucky, we're all lucky. 
40	SONG:		"THE TIME WARP" 
BRAD and JANET are rather unnerved by this outburst from the domestic. They look back to RIFF RAFF.  He is now standing by a set of mirrors reflecting to infinity. 
RIFF RAFF It's astounding Time is fleeting Madness takes its toll But listen closely Not for very much longer I've got to keep control. 
MAGENTA gives RIFF RAFF a strange signal. 
RIFF RAFF starts to dance in an extraordinary fashion. 
RIFF RAFF I remember doing the Time Warp. 
BRAD and JANET are amazed. 
RIFF RAFF Drinking those moments when The blackness would hit me. 
MAGENTA half closes her eyes in pleasure. 
JANET clings to BRAD. 
RIFF RAFF And the void would be calling. 
RIFF RAFF opens a set of double doors marked BALLROOM. 
41	INT.	BALLROOM	NIGHT 
BRAD and JANET find themselves on a balcony of a huge black and silver ballroom.  At the furthest end is a throne-like chair and, surrounding it, a theatre proscenium.  In the body of the room are GUESTS.  They are the people BRAD and JANET passed on the road.  They are the Transylvanian Secret Agents - assembled on this special occasion from all over the earth.  It is the Annual Transylvanian Convention - announced by an official banner suspended over the Ballroom.  They are all dressed in strange but elegant evening wear.  They are a distorted version of the GUESTS from the Denton wedding.  A party spirit prevails, they throw their arms out in a plea to RIFF RAFF on the balcony. 
GUESTS Let's do the Time Warp again. 
JANET falls into BRAD's arms. 
RIFF RAFF is ecstatic. 
BRAD revives JANET. 
GUESTS (repeating action) Let's do the Time Warp again. 
JANET faints again. 
CUT TO 
42	INT.	STUDY	NIGHT 
The NARRATOR moves from his desk to the wall behind him.  He pulls down a chart with illustrated dance steps on it.  He gestures to the appropriate section of the diagram with the pointer. 
NARRATOR It's just a jump to the left.

47	INT.	BANDSTAND	NIGHT 
COLUMBIA Well I was walking down the street Just having a think When a snake of a guy Gave me an evil wink. Well it shook me up It took me by surprise He had a pick-up truck And the devil's eyes He stared at me And I felt a change Time meant nothing Never would again.

But it's the pelvic thrust. 
LOW TRAVELLING SHOT between their legs. 
That really drives you insane. Let's do the Time Warp again. 
Everyone reverses direction. 
Let's do the Time Warp again. 
All the GUESTS fall to the floor like flies exhausted. 
CUT TO 
53	INT.	BALCONY/HALLWAY	NIGHT 
JANET Oh....Say something. 
BRAD Say!  Do any of you guys know the Madison? 
No one laughs. 
BRAD clumsily attempts to circle around FRANK.  FRANK meanwhile ignores him and greets his other guests. 
BRAD I'm glad we caught you at home Ah - could we use your phone We're both in a bit of a hurry. 
JANET joins BRAD. 
JANET Right! 
BRAD We'll just say where we are Then go back to the car We don't want to be any worry. 
FRANK turns on them. 
FRANK You got caught with a flat Well how about that Well babies don't you panic By the light of the night It'll seem alright I'll get you a satanic mechanic. 
FRANK turns his back on BRAD and JANET and splitting the ranks of his GUESTS, departs for the other end of the Ballroom.  Streamers fall. 
FRANK I'm just a sweet transvestite From Transexual Transylvania. 
From the throne he gestures towards BRAD and JANET rather slowly over the next verse. 
FRANK Why dont'cha stay for the night 
RIFF & MAGENTA "night" Or maybe a bite 
RIFF & MAGENTA "bite" I could show you my favourite obsession I've been making a man With blonde hair and a tan And he's good for relieving my tension. 
We view from OVERHEAD as the GUESTS surround him adoringly. 
FRANK I'm just a sweet transvestite From Transexual Transylvania. 
FRANK storms down the Ballroom to the lift. 
I'm just a sweet transvestite. 
GUESTS "Sweet Transvestite"

60	CHORD:  SUBLIMINAL FLASH OF LOVE MAKING 
CUT TO 
61	INT.	LIFT AREA 
RIFF RAFF throws two GUESTS to the floor to make room for them. He slams the cage door. 
The two discarded GUESTS cry and claw at the cage door as the lift moves off under RIFF RAFF's control. 
BRAD and JANET are squashed, arms by their side. 
They stare straight ahead. 
JANET (to Magenta) It he - Frank - is he your husband? 
General amusement. 
RIFF RAFF The Master is not yet married.  Nor do I think he ever will be.  We are simply his servants. 
JANET Oh. 
The lift grinds to a halt. 
They have arrived at the laboratory. 
CUT TO 
69	INT.	LABORATORY	NIGHT 
The laboratory is somewhere between a student observation operating theatre and a Greek gymnasium.  It is pink-tiled throughout, facing the lift entrance is a circular area containing a TANK on pedestals which though screened at this stage will be revealed to contain the body of ROCKY submerged in chemicals, the wall to one side contains a raised dias area for the GUESTS, and facing one end of the tank, the operational controls, monitor and a giant refrigerator.  A chandelier hangs above the tank. 
On the podium in front of Frank's chambers there is a stand microphone. Near the podium are some weights.  Behind the tank is a vaulting horse. These are wrapped in sellophane - Rocky's presents. 
The GUESTS are waiting as the lift arrives. 
FRANK, now in surgeon's outfit stands in the middle of the room.  RIFF RAFF gets out of the lift first, with a glass of champagne which he hands to FRANK. 
FRANK Magenta, Columbia, go and assist Riff Raff. 
As he speaks her name each one steps forward out of the lift.  They cross to RIFF RAFF behind the tank. 
FRANK I will entertain...ah... 
BRAD & JANET step out of the lift. 
BRAD I'm Brad Majors and this is my fiancee, Janet Vice. 
JANET Weiss. 
BRAD Weiss. 
FRANK (Taking Janet's hand to kiss) Encante....How nice.  (he circles them) And what charming underclothes you both have. (He takes two dust coats from Riff Raff and hands them to Brad). But here, put these on.  They'll make you feel less vulnerable. 
MAGENTA & COLUMBIA cross to the podium. 
FRANK (continues) It's not often we receive visitors here. Let alone offer them hospitality. 
BRAD (Moving towards Frank) Hospitality!  All we wanted to do was use your telephone.  A reasonable request which you have chosen to ignore. 
JANET (Hurring after Brad) Don't be ungrateful Brad. 
BRAD (Stepping closer to Frank) Ungrateful! 
The room falls silent.  All eyes are on FRANK, waiting for his reaction. A smile breaks on his face. 
FRANK How forceful you are Brad.  Such a perfect specimen of manhood.  So dominant. 
MAGENTA & COLUMBIA laugh. 
You must be awfully proud of him Janet. 
JANET Well, yes I am. 
THE GUESTS oh and ah appreciatively, BRAD laughs, a little embarassed. 
FRANK Do you have any tattoos Brad. 
FRANK runs down the ladder and kicks RIFF RAFF who starts to lower the chandelier.  FRANK climbs up the other steps to meet his creation coming down.  MAGENTA & COLUMBIA cross to the tank. 
ROCKY And I've got the feeling Someone's going to be Cutting the thread. 
Oh, woe is me. My life is a misery. 
Oh, can't you see That I'm at the start Of a pretty big downer.... 
As ROCKY gets level with him, FRANK lunges for him but lands inside the tank....because... 
ROCKY simultaneously abandons the chandelier, lands between MAGENTA and COLUMBIA who now each have a pair of scissors with which they will snip his arm and leg bandages. 
ROCKY I woke up this morning With a start When I fell out of bed. 
GUESTS (inc. Riff, Magenta & Columbia) That ain't no crime. 
ROCKY And left from my dreaming Was a feeling Of un-nameable dread. 
GUESTS That ain't no crime 
ROCKY My high is low. I'm dressed up With no place to go. 
And all I know Is I'm at the start Of a pretty big downer. 
FRANK, in the tank behind ROCKY, puts his arms round ROCKY's neck. ROCKY spins away.  MAGENTA and COLUMBIA hang on to one end of his chest bandage so that it undoes as he goes. 
GUESTS (inc. RIFF RAFF, MAGENTA & COLUMBIA) Sha la la la That ain't no crime. 
ROCKY Oh, no no, no no. 
GUESTS Sha la la la That ain't no crime. 
ROCKY No no no, no no. 
GUESTS Sha la la la That ain't no crime - That ain't no crime. 
ROCKY is now unbandaged.  He strikes a pose. 
During the last sequence, FRANK climbs out of the tank onto RIFF RAFF'S shoulders and purses ROCKY, but they fall. 
72	INT.	STUDY	NIGHT 
NARRATOR reading from book. 
NARRATOR Rocky needed peace of mind. He didn't know He was doing just fine. 
He was the product Of another time. And as for feeling down - Well that's not a crime. 
73	INT.	LABORATORY	NIGHT 
FRANK and RIFF RAFF are recovering from their fall. 
ROCKY makes a circuit of the GUESTS. 
GUESTS (Riff, Magenta & Columbia) That ain't no crime. 
ROCKY (To first group of guests) The sword of Damocles is Hanging over my head. 
GUESTS That ain't no crime. 
ROCKY (To second group) And I've got the feeling Someone's going to be Cutting the thread. 
GUESTS That ain't no crime. 
ROCKY (To third group) Oh, woe is me - My life is a mystery. 
(To fourth group) Oh can't you see That I'm at the start Of a pretty big downer. 
ROCKY set off at a run as FRANK looms up again. 
(FRANK is chasing ROCKY round the lab.) 
FRANK He'll eat nutritious high protein And swallow raw eggs. Try to build up his shoulders, His chest, arms and legs. 
Such an effort - If he only knew of my plan. In just seven days, 
GUESTS, RIFF, MAGENTA & COLUMBIA & FRANK I can make you a ma-aa-a-a-an 
ROCKY throws down the weights and begins press ups. 
FRANK He'll do press-ups and chin-ups, Do the snatch, clean and jerk. 
FRANK crosses to JANET & BRAD 
He thinks dynamic tension Must be hard work. Such strenuous living I just don't understand. 
FRANK moves back to ROCKY who is still pressing up. 
When, in just seven days - Oh baby...(ROCKY jumps up.) 
I can make you A ma-a-a-a-an...(laugh). 
75	INT.	LABORATORY: REFRIGERATOR	NIGHT 
The large refrigeration unit door slowly opens, falling like a drawbridge.  Inside is a wall of ice and many CocaCola bottles. Through these bursts an icy EDDIE riding a Harley Davidson motor bike, ex World War II, holding a Gibson guitar. 
Several guests are crushed to death. 
COLUMBIA Eddie! 
EDDIE Stay cool baby. 
JANET Who's Eddie? 
RIFF RAFF The delivery boy. 
MAGENTA His delivery wasn't good enough though. 
ROCKY looks terrified. 
JANET has fainted yet again. 
EDDIE comes to life. 
76	SONG:		"WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO SATURDAY NIGHT" 
EDDIE Whatever happened to Saturday night When you dressed up sharp And you felt alright It don't seem the same since cosmic light Came into my life and I thought I was divine. 
COLUMBIA leaps on to the pillion seat. 
I used to go for a ride with a chick who'd go And listen to the music on the radio. 
The MOTORCYCLISTS GUESTS remember only too well. 
A saxophone was blowing on a rock and roll show And we climbed in the back And we really had a good time 
COLUMBIA rushes to the switchboard, flicks a lighting switch and all the lights above the stairs start changing colour. 
The GUESTS go crazy and rock and roll all over the staircase. 
COLUMBIA dances with EDDIE. 
Even RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA step it out. 
ALL Hot patootie Bless my soul I really love that rock and roll (four times) 
EDDIE (more confident, less frozen) leaps onto the motorbike in a legs apart guitar strumming pose. 
FRANK is getting furious. 
ROCKY is perplexed. 
EDDIE My head used to swim From the perfume I smelled. My hands kind of fumbled With her white plastic belt. I'd taster her baby pink lipstick, And that's when I'd melt. And she'd whisper in my ear, Tonight she really was mine. 
In just seven days I can make you A ma-ha-ha-ha-haaan. 
CUT TO 
79	INT.	BRIDAL SUITE	NIGHT 
RIFF RAFF presses a button and a wall opens revealing a bridal suite done out in black silk. 
The GUESTS shout their approval. 
The end of the SONG turns into Mendelssohn's wedding march and FRANK leads ROCKY to his bridal chamber. 
The GUESTS throw confetti. 
BRAD and JANET look at each other in amazement. 
WIPE TO 
80	INT.	STUDY	NIGHT 
NARRATOR There are some people who say that life is an illusion, and that reality is simply a figment of our imaginations!  If this is so, then Brad and Janet are quite safe. However, the sudden departure of their host and his creation (into the seclusion of his sombre bridal suite) had left them feeling both apprehensive and uneasy. A feeling which grew as the other guests 'departed' and 'they' were shown to their separate rooms. 
WIPE TO 
81	INT.	JANET'S ROOM (RED FILTER)	NIGHT 
JANET looks lost. 
She sits on the end of the bed.

BRAD looks lost. 
He examines the TV monitor. 
83	INT.	LABORATORY	NIGHT 
RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA by the monitor. 
They switch from channel to channel. 
We see BRAD looking at the TV monitor. 
And JANET sitting on the end of the bed. 
JANET lies back on the bed and switches off her bedside lamp. 
RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA smile at each other. 
CUT TO 
84	INT.	JANET'S ROOM (RED FILTER)	NIGHT 
Only a soft glow of moonlight from a barred window.  ON the netting round her bed. 
There is a knock at the door. 
JANET sits p. 
JANET Who is it?  Who's there? 
BRAD's voice from behind the door. 
BRAD'S VOICE It's only me, Janet. 
She relaxes. 
JANET Oh, Brad, come in, darling. 
WIPE TO 
92E	INT.	BRAD'S ROOM (BLUE FILTER)	NIGHT 
BRAD So baby don't cry like there's no tomorrow After the night there's a brand new day. And there'll be no pain And no more sorrow. So wash your face And phone my place It'll be O.K. 
WIPE TO

WIPE TO 
92H	INT.	LABORATORY	NIGHT 
JANET If only we hadn't made this journey. If only the car hadn't broken down. If only we were amongst friends or sane persons. 
WIPE TO 
93	INT.	STUDY	NIGHT 
The NARRATOR is leaning back in his armchair, cool and considerate. 
NARRATOR "If" and "Only", two small words.  Words which kept repeating themselves again and again in Janet's thoughts.  But it was too late to go back now.  It was as if she were riding a giant tidal wave.  It would be folly to fight against it.  Her only chance would be to ride it out - adapt - and perhaps also to survive. 
WIPE TO 
94	INT.	LABORATORY	NIGHT 
JANET is pacing around the tank which is covered by a cloth.  She becomes aware of the sound of someone crying inside.  She pulls the cloth back to reveal ROCKY lying in the tank - exhausted and bleeding. 
ROCKY HORROR looks miserable. 
JANET Yes.  There you see it's instinctive. This room is your womb.  You returned here for one thing - security. 
JANET crosses to the TV monitor. 
JANET Oh Brad!  What have they done with him? 
CUT TO 
95	TV MONITOR 
She switches on the monitor. 
She changes the channels on the monitor getting various empty rooms in the castle. 
Occasional shot of alsatian dogs. 
Till finally she switches into BRAD's bedroom and sees BRAD sitting on the end of the bed and FRANK lying asleep on the bed. 
CUT TO 
96	INT.	LABORATORY	NIGHT 
JANET Ahhh! 
ROCKY smiles helplessly. 
JANET moves away from the monitor and back to ROCKY. 
JANET Oh Brad.  How could you? (she sees Rocky's wounds) Oh, but you're hurt.  Did they do this to you? 
ROCKY nods. 
COLUMBIA & MAGENTA are watching the TV relay of ROCKY & JANET. They are amused by JANET'S inexperience, parodying her as they sing. 
COLUMBIA Touch-a touch-a touch-a, touch me. 
MAGENTA I wanna be dirty. 
COLUMBIA 
Thrill me, chill me, fulfil me. 
MAGENTA Creature of the night. 
103	INT.	LABORATORY	NIGHT

JANET & ROCKY in each other's arms hear another scream in the distance. 
106	INT.	CORRIDOR OUTSIDE LABORATORY	NIGHT 
FRANK is chasing RIFF RAFF with a whip.  BRAD is following. 
RIFF RAFF rushes into the lift and presses the button desperately but FRANK follows him and so does BRAD.  We see the lift descending. 
107	INT.	LABORATORY.	NIGHT 
RIFF RAFF slides across the laboratory floor escaping FRANK's whip. 
RIFF RAFF Aaaargh!  Mercy. 
FRANK How did it happen?  I understood you were to be watching. 
115	INT.	LABORATORY	NIGHT 
FRANK Well, let's ask him. 
FRANK throws a switch marked "TRIPLE CONTACT ELECTRO MAGNET". 
CUT TO 
116	EXT/INT.	VARIOUS LOCALES	NIGHT 
We see DR SCOTT's wheelchair screaming through corridors, rooms and doors and ends up clamped to the electro magnet in the laboratory. 
CUT TO 
117	INT.	LABORATORY	NIGHT 
BRAD is amazed. 
BRAD Dr. Scott! 
DR EVERETT SCOTT is even more amazed. 
DR SCOTT Brad!  What are you doing here? 
FRANK releases the electro magnet. 
The wheelchair hits the floor. 
FRANK Don't play games, Dr Scott.  You know very well what Brad Majors's doing here. It was part of your plan was it not that he, and his female, should check the layout for you.  Well, unfortunately for you all there's to be a change of plans.  I'm sure you're adaptable, Dr Scott.  I know Brad is. 
BRAD looks embarrassed and humiliated. 
DR SCOTT I can assure you that Brad's presence comes as a complete surprise to me. I came to find Eddie. 
BRAD Eddie?  I've seen him.  He's... 
FRANK cuts in quickly. 
FRANK Eddie?  What do you know of Eddie, Dr Scott? 
DR SCOTT I happen to know a great deal about a lot of things.  You see Eddie happens to be my nephew. 
BRAD Dr Scott. 
A stifled gasp is heard from JANET behind the curtain. 
FRANK is surprised. 
FRANK crosses the screen and pulls back the curtain to reveal JANET and ROCKY. 
DR SCOTT Janet! 
JANET Dr Scott! 
BRAD Janet! 
FRANK Rocky! 
ROCKY reviles FRANK with a look.  He puts his arm around JANET. 
FRANK is appalled. 
FRANK Listen!  I made you, and I can break you just as easily. 
ROCKY is terrified.  He takes his arm away from JANET. 
FRANK That's better. 
A GONG is heard.  MAGENTA comes through the broken tiles. 
MAGENTA Master, dinner is prepared.

JANET rushes in, down the ramp, with FRANK in pursuit. 
FRANK Y'got a block, Take my advice. You'd better wise up, Janet Weiss. 
DR. SCOTT & BRAD arrive in the lift.  FRANK has circled the tank and arrived at the control panel. 
FRANK The transducer (He slams the handle) Will seduce yah. 
DR. SCOTT, BRAD & JANET find they are stuck to the floor. 
JANET My feet - I can' move my feet. 
DR. SCOTT My wheels - My God, I can't move my wheels. 
BRAD It's as if we were glued to the spot. 
FRANK You are - so quake with fear, you tiny fools. 
JANET We're trapped. 
FRANK (Moving to her) It's something you'll Get used to. A mental mind fuck Can be nice. 
JANET Oh! 
FRANK climbs up the ladder beside the tank. 
(music under this dialogue) 
DR. SCOTT You won't find earth people quite the easy mark you imagine.  This sonic transducer - it is, I suppose, some kind of audio-vibratory, physiomolecular transport device.... 
BRAD You mean... 
DR. SCOTT Yes Brad.  It's something we ourselves have been working on.  But it seems our friend here has found a way of perfecting it.  A device which is capable of breaking down solid matter and then projecting it through space, and - who knows - perhaps even time itself! 
JANET You mean he's gonna send us to another planet? 
FRANK leaps off the tank to the floor. 
FRANK Planet. 
Schmanet. 
Janet. 
FRANK circles JANET, testing her thighs.  BRAD struggles in vain. 
FRANK You'd better wise up, Janet Weiss. You'd better wise up, Build your thighs up. You'd better wise up.

JANET screams out. 
JANET Sto-o-o-o-o-op. 
She cried so loudly that FRANK staggers backwards towards the control panel. 
RIFF RAFF & MAGENTA enter through the hole in the tiles - they march to behind the tank and then the control panel. 
FRANK (singing) Don't get hot and flustered - Use a bit of mustard. 
BRAD You're a hot dog But you'd better not Try to hurt her, Frank Furter. 
FRANK signals to MAGENTA.

CUT TO 
159	INT.	STAGE	NIGHT 
JANET animates.  She behaves like a sex goddess, completely out of control, as if performing in a burlesque show. 
JANET I feel released Bad times deceased My confidence increased Reality is here The game has been disbanded My mind has been expanded It's a gas that Frankie's landed His lust is so sincere. 
160	INT.	STAGE	NIGHT 
We PULL BACK on the whole stage.  The velvets open to reveal the 20th Century Fox logo as a stage set. 
At the top of the staircase FRANK appears bathed in light. 
He wears a dazzling version of the national costume and a chiffon cloak which billows in the breeze from a wind machine.  He is reminiscent of a 30's film star. 
FRANK What ever happened to Fay Wray That delicate satin-draped frame As it clung to her thigh How I started to cry For I wanted to be dressed just the same. 
CUT TO 
161	INT.	STAGE	NIGHT 
The GUESTS flee down the ballroom and out the door. 
We see the laughing figures of RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA making a special sign to each other. 
CUT TO 
165	INT.	CASTLE CORRIDORS	NIGHT 
We see BRAD and JANET fleeing with DR SCOTT following behind. 
165A	INT.	BALLROOM	NIGHT 
RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA's laughter has subsided. 
RIFF RAFF Our noble mission is almost completed my most beautiful sister, soon we will return to the moon-drenched shores of our "androgenous" planet. 
MAGENTA Ah - sweet Transexual - land of night - to sing and dance once more to your dark refrains.  To take that step to the right... 
RIFF RAFF But it's the pelvic thrust that really drives you insane. 
MAGENTA And our World will do the Time Warp again. 
165B	EXT.	CASTLE	DAWN 
There is a huge explosion. 
166	EXT.	CASTLE	DAWN 
We see the entire castle surrounded by a giant beam of light and then vanish into space. 
During the explosion sequence the film reverts optically to black and white. 
DISSOLVE TO 
167	EXT.	THE CRATER	DAY 
SONG:		"SUPER-HEROES" 
BRAD, JANET, and DR SCOTT's bodies are scattered on three sides surrounding a crater where the castle once was. 
The scene is arid and deserted.  There are remnants of DR SCOTT's wheelchair, EDDIE's coffin and broken objects from the laboratory. 
BRAD, tattered and bleeding, lifts himself up. 
BRAD I've done a lot God knows I've tried To find the truth I've even lied But all I know is down inside. 
DR SCOTT drags himself to his knees. 
BRAD & DR SCOTT I'm bleeding. 
JANET (revives) And super heroes Come to feast To taste the flesh Not yet deceased And al I know Is still the beast 
TRIO Is feeding. 
The three of them stand shakily on the perimeter of the crater. 
All that is left is dust and sand and wind and the sun. 
The CAMERA PANS from face to face in a circular movement getting faster and faster as the trio sing a chorale of hopelessness. 
DISSOLVE TO 
168	INT.	STUDY	NIGHT 
The CAMERA has spun into a blur but focusses on a spinning globe of the earth on the NARRATOR's desk. 
The NARRATOR puts his hand on the globe, stopping it. 
He is standing over his lectern reading from his book like a preacher in a pulpit. 
NARRATOR And crawling on the planet's face Some insects called the human race Lost in time, and lost in space And meaning.

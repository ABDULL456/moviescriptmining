COMMANDO 
Written by 
Richard Tuggle 
FINAL April 18, 1985 
"COMMANDO" BLACK SCREEN. One word explodes towards us with cold brutality: COMMANDO. It FADES... leaves us in darkness. And we HEAR a growing ROAR... a frightening RUMBLE. 
FADE IN 
EXT. SUBURBAN CUL-DE-SAC - DAY 1 
TIGHT ON the churning compactor of a garbage truck. The CAMERA PULLS BACK and we SEE the truck, battered and olive-grey. A bored garbage man with a kerchief over his mouth hangs on the back of the truck as it moves along the street. 
INT. BEDROOM - CLOSE ON THE BED - DAY 2 
As LAWSON awakes with a start. He's late 30's, a little worn. He shakes his WIFE. 
LAWSON What's that? 
WIFE 
(BARELY AWAKE) Unnn...sounds like... 
(STIFLING YAWN) .the garbage men. 
LAWSON On Tuesday? 
WIFE 
(YAWNING) Maybe they changed the schedule... Lawson listens to the noise as it APPROACHES, finally throws his feet into his bedroom slippers. 
LAWSON Shit. 
INT. LAWSON'S HOUSE - PANTRY 3 
He runs into the pantry, dragging several ungainly plastic trash bags. 
A85 
EXT. LAWSON'S HOUSE - DAY 4 
The truck SOUND is CLOSER now. We can SEE it at the end of the long driveway. Lawson flings the green plastic bags into two battered and half-full metal cans, starts running down the driveway. 
LAWSON 
(SHOUTING) Wait a minute, wait a minute! 
END OF DRIVEWAY - DAY 5 The truck stops at the bottom of the driveway. Lawson stumbles his way towards it, smiles. 
MAIN TITLES BEGIN...and along with them we HEAR MUSIC. The CAMERA SKIMS OVER snow-capped peaks, pine trees twinkling dew in the morning light. Then we SEE it: An 80's version of a log cabin...with crisp, clean lines...energy efficient and snug. 
A85 
ANOTHER ANGLE 16 as a giant FIGURE descends from the mountains behind the house balancing a giant log on his right shoulder and carrying a chain saw in his left hand. This is COLONEL JOHN ALEXANDER MATRIX. He's in his mid-thirties ...a man of raw power and vitality...and something else: Joy. Joy, and a sense of calm. Matrix reaches a shed behind the cabin. He puts down the log and chain saw, then picks up firewood and begins to SPLIT it with awesome single swipes of an axe. 
INTERCUT: 
LOW ANGLE - HOUSE 17 as a shadow comes stealthily alongside the house and begins to slowly and cautiously advance on Matrix. 
INTERCUT: 
MATRIX AND APPROACHING PERSON 18 Matrix doesn't turn or otherwise seem to see the other person...but he reacts to little things: 
EXT. HOUSE - SERIES OF SHOTS AND SOUNDS - DAY 19- 
A. A TWIG cracks. 
B. A SQUIRREL scampers away, startled. 
C. SOME PEBBLES roll away. 
D. A GATE responds with a faint creak while: 
E. THE AXEHEAD reflects a dull, indistinct figure approaching Matrix from behind. None of the above escapes matrix's eye...and then, at the last possible second, he WHIRLS and confronts: 
A85 
NEW ANGLE 24 s Matrix sweeps up the intruder-his eleven-year-old daughter, JENNY. She laughs as he tickles her. 
JENNY Dad... Dad... put me down. She tickles him back on his neck and ribs...he laughs, puts her down. 
MATRIX I surrender, I surrender. He raises his hands, open, trusting. Instantly she attacks again, then runs like hell as he pursues her, 
MUSIC CONTINUES. 
EXT. ROADSIDE ICE CREAM STAND - DAY 25 
Matrix's Blazer is parked here. Father and daughter sit across from each other-she has a cone, he has a dish. He uses his spoon to steal some of her flavor and jimmies...he gets away with this twice before she pokes him on the nose with the cone. He wipes ice cream from his face. 
EXT. CABIN STREAM AREA - DAY 26 
Matrix and Jenny are trout fishing in a beautiful stream. A deer tentatively approaches and matrix and Jenny take food from a knapsack and hold it out for the deer. The deer comes closer, takes the food from them, then licks their hands. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
MATRIX 26-A shows Jenny karate moves. She tries a move on him and he pretends she's knocked him over. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
MATRIX 26-B gives Jenny a piggyback ride over the bridge that crosses the stream, as they head back to the cabin. 
KIRBY Silent and smooth...just like always. He smiles and he and Matrix come together and shake hands. 
MATRIX I better be. You taught me. He affectionately squeezes Kirby's shoulder. Jenny comes out of the cabin toward the two men. 
KIRBY I need to talk to your dad, Jenny. 
JENNY No way, Jose. Matrix gives her a sharp look and Jenny grudgingly goes back inside. Kirby and Matrix begin to walk as clouds billow high above the mountaintops around them. Cont. 
A85 
REVISED - "COM.MANDO" - 4/22/85 9 32 Cont. 
KIRBY Someone's killing your men. 
MATRIX 
(STARTLED) You gave them new identities... 
KIRBY There must have been a leak. Lawson, Forrestal... Bennett have all been hit. 
MATRIX Who's doing it? X 
KIRBY You've made enemies all over the X world, John. It could be the Syrians, the South Africans, the Russians-or a terrorist group. 
(PAUSING) They're gonna find you. Matrix looks toward the cabin. Jenny is watching him through a window. Matrix turns back to Kirby and they begin walking back to the cabin. 
MATRIX We were going to make a normal X life here... 
KIRBY You will...I promise. I'm going X into the city to coordinate with the Federal people. In the meantime, Jackson and Harris will stay with you. Matrix looks the two soldiers over. 
MATRIX They any good? 
KIRBY Real good... 
(PAUSING) But not as good as you were. 
OUT 33- 
CUT TO: 
A65 
MATRIX - LATER 37 watches the chopper lift off and fly away. Jenny, subdued, comes out of the cabin. 
JENNY Is it bad? 
MATRIX I'm not leaving you... if that's what you mean. 
JENNY Then it can't be bad. She smiles. An intense look comes over Matrix's face, then -- In a BLUR, he sweeps up Jenny in his arms just before machine gun fire BLASTS the cabin. The VOLLEY OF FIRING SHATTERS the windows and RIPS OPEN Harris' chest, his blood SPLATTERING against the cabin. .Matrix, still clutching Jenny, DIVES through the door into the cabin and HITS the floor. Jackson CATCHES a round in the shoulder, SPINS to the ground, then crawls through the door after Matrix. The three of them lie on the cabin floor as the FIRING CONTINUES to BLAST AWAY at Harris' body, the rounds SMACKING into the side of the cabin. Then the firing stops. Silence. 
MATRIX 
DIAZ She's safe, Major. Whether she stays that way.is up to you. My people got some business with you... Matrix hears a NOISE outside, glances out the window and sees two vehicles RACING away from the house. 
DIAZ .and if you want your kid back, you gotta cooperate. Right? 
MATRIX Wrong. Matrix levels the H&K and BLASTS Diaz in the chest. Diaz and the chair are JERKED violently backward. 
ABRUPT CUT TO: 
EXT. CABIN - DAY 43 
Matrix JUMPS out of the cabin and RACES to the BLAZER, its hood up. He checks the engine. Torn wires stick up, the distributor cap is disconnected and broken. Cont. 
A85 
43 Cont. He looks down the mountain and sees the vehicles winding along the mountain roads. Matrix slams the Blazer's hood...gets inside...puts his weapons on the seat...then releases the brake. Then, one hand on the wheel, the other on the door frame, he begins to push the car. He steers it not towards the dirt road, but towards the shoulder where a steep incline leads downward. Since the Blazer is pointed the wrong way, Matrix is pushing it uphill-the effort is incredible... the veins on his neck stand out...with a SCREAM, he puts everything he's got into it... and finally it begins to roll downwards. Matrix leaps in. Snaps on the driver's shoulder belt... reaches over and wraps the passenger belt around his body as well. The Blazer rolls over the edge. 
BLAZER - SEVERAL SHOTS 44 as it bounces wildly down the 45 degree slope. 
INT. BLAZER 45 
Matrix fights to control the wheel. A low-hanging branch SMASHES the windshield. 
DARK VEHICLE 46 It takes another curve. CAMERA PANS UP, and we SEE the Blazer, coming closer and closer by this direct route. 
THE BLAZER 47 It barrels down the mountainside, out of control, smashing through trees, bounding off rocks, dropping like a stone. 
INT. BLAZER 48 
Matrix is taking a terrible beating. But he's almost down to the road...ahead of the black vehicle! 
WIDE ANGLE - WINDING ROAD 49 The two vehicles narrowly miss each other-the dark car almost spins out. 
THE BLAZER 50 It careens past the other car, slams into a huge boulder -- flips -- ROLLS OVER AND OVER. 
A8 5 
THE OTHER VEHICLE 51 o.s. of this mishap, rushing down the road. 
THE WRECKED BLAZER 52 The wrecked Blazer is BURNING, then suddenly EXPLODES. The CAMERA HOLDS ON this, what looks like Matrix's funeral pyre. Then we SEE movement and SEE a bloodied and injured Matrix crawling away from the intense fire. He stops and looks back at the destroyed Blazer. 
WIDER ANGLE 53 A large group of armed soldiers start to surround Matrix. He stands up, cut, bleeding. The lead man approaches to frisk him. 
MATRIX 54 Matrix ELBOWS him in the stomach, DRIVES his fist into the man's Adam's apple, PULLS HIM DOWN, CRACKS the man's vertebrae, grabs the dead man's rifle and SLAMS the butt against the face on the man closing on him. The man's jaw SHATTERS. But three more men are immediately on Matrix and they wrestle him to the ground. He forces his way up again, the three men still all over him. Matrix's eyes suddenly WIDEN as he looks at two boots with an attached knife, then up at the man standing in them. It's Bennett, the man we saw die! 
MATRIX 
(STUNNED) I thought you were -- Bennett reaches up with a bulky pistol and points it at Matrix. 
BENNETT Dead... He FIRES at point-blank range. Matrix is BLASTED backward to the ground. 
CUT TO: 
57 Cont.l Matrix FIGHTS at the chains like a crazy man, but he can't move. Arius fingers the shirt collar around her neck. 
ARIUS You kill Velasquez, Major, and you'll get her back. You try anything else... 
(PAUSING) .and I'll send her to you in pieces. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. MATRIX'S CABIN - DAY 58 
General Kirby stands in front of the cabin looking at the bodies of Jackson, Harris and Diaz. Soldiers are searching around and inside the cabin. One of the Soldiers approaches Kirby. 
KIRBY Any sign of Matrix? 
SOLDIER No Sir, just those bodies... 
(PAUSES) .You think there's more? 
KIRBY If he's still alive, I'd expect a lot more.

BENNETT 
(TO MATRIX) Sully will make sure you get on the plane and Henriques will stay with you to make sure you get off. If I don't get a call from either one of them, she's dead. Cont.

EXT. LIMO - DAY 61 
Matrix looks back at Bennett through the open door. 
MATRIX I'll be back, Bennett... For you. 
BENNETT I'll be ready. They eye each other, then Sully shuts the door and Matrix watches the limo drive off. Henriques and Sully flank Matrix and they enter the terminal. 
INT. TERMINAL - DAY 62 
The three of them pass through the terminal. Matrix looks toward two police officers that are right next to them, but he remains silent. Henriques, Matrix and Sully walk through the X-ray booths as the security guard watches, then they continue on.

INT. DC-10 GALLEY - DAY 67 
Matrix moves to the service elevator, squeezes in, hits the controls and starts to descend. 
BELOW DECK 67-A the elevator stops in the service area of the big plane. Matrix gets out of the elevator and looks out a port. The place is moving faster! He turns and moves to a door marked CARGO HOLD. It's locked. He PULLS, the door starts to bend, then the lock suddenly SNAPS. He opens the door and crawls inside. 
CUT TO:

CUT TO: 
MATRIX You're not gonna make it. She starts the car. Sully drives by them in his Porsche Targa.

EXT. FREEWAY - SULLY - DUSK 95 
As dusk approaches, Sully drives along the freeway, occasionally glancing into his rearview mirror. 
KILL HER!! HELP ME!! Cindy looks at Matrix, glances toward Sully, then looks back at Matrix. 
CINDY Okay, okay. X 
X Matrix lets her arm go and she rubs it gingerly. 
CINDY Take it easy, all right. She continues to look at the pleading Matrix, then she turns and hesitantly begins walking toward Sully. Sully walks by a video game parlor, ogles some girls, checks his watch, then heads for the bar on this level. 
A85 
100 Cont. Cindy walks around the open space, following Sully. She glances back tentatively at Matrix, then she keeps going. Matrix moves in the other direction around the open space, all the while watching Sully and Cindy. 
BAR 101 New Wave music PLAYS as valley gals and sharp dudes dance and mingle about. Sully can dig this scene -- he puts his dark glasses back on. He sits at a table, puts the briefcase next to his leg and orders a drink. A LATIN MAN wearing a leisure suit, looking completely out of place in a joint like this, enters the bar, and stares at a girl with purple hair. He continues into the bar, catches Sully's eye and sits down at the table with him. He reaches under the table and slides the briefcase away from Sully until its next to himself, then hands Sully, still under the table, a bunch of passports. 
OPEN SPACE 102 Cindy approaches the bar, hesitates, then looks back at Matrix. Across the open space, he nods, urging her forward. She hesitantly moves forward. 
BAR Cindy enters the bar, then sees a young security guard, CATES, coming out of the men's room. She moves around a corner so Matrix can't see her and she stops the guard. 
CINDY There's a huge guy across the way who either honestly needs my help or he's an escaped mental fruitcake. Take a look... Cates moves into the doorway, casually glances at Matrix watching the bar, then Cates moves out of Matrix's view. He removes the walkie-talkie from his belt and speaks into it. 
CATES Biggs, you there? 
SECOND LEVEL Another security guard, BIGGS, a muscular black kid, is flirting with some valley girls and ignoring the constant BEEPING of his walkie-talkie. Cont. 
A85 
104 Cont. 
BIGGS .This ain't no Mexican shit, I'm talkin' Maui wowie. Tired of the BEEPING, he picks up his walkie-talkie. 
BIGGS 
(IRRITATED) What it is, zitface... 
INTERCUT: 
WITH CATES 
CATES There's a guy up here who may be a wacko. I don't think I can handle him alone. 
BIGGS Cool down, puke breath, I'll be right there. (smiling to girls) Wanna see me kick some ass? 
CUT TO: 
MATRIX 106 Matrix is getting anxious. He looks at his watch. 
BAR 107 Sully is in conversation with the Latin man, unaware of what's going on outside. Cindy sneaks a look outside and sees Biggs and his two valley girls approaching Matrix. 
OPEN SPACE 108 Biggs confidently walks along the top level, the girls following. He STOPS abruptly as he sees Matrix, his eyes bulge and he retreats into an alcove and pulls out his walkie-talkie. 
BIGGS Attention all units! Emergency on the theater level! Suspect is six-foot-two, brown hair... 
I Matrix swings down to the lower level and CRASHES RIGHT THROUGH THE GLASS into the elevator with Sully. The cop comes up from the ground and looks at Cindy. She looks back at him uncertainly. He starts to bring the gun toward her and she moves quickly to a door marked "Stairwell" and disappears.

Matrix and Sully are both lying bloodied and dazed in the elevator. It descends silently, the two men lying in the broken glass.

CUT TO: 
INT. GALLERIA PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT 124

EXT. GALLERIA PARKING LOT - NIGHT 125 
Sully SHOOTS WILDLY out onto Sepulveda, BLASTING his horn as he swerves into the wrong lane. Cindy watches him zoom by. She looks down the block. Now the cop is RUNNING toward her. Matrix RIPS out onto Sepulveda. Cindy races out onto the street, her hands held up to stop him. 
CINDY 
WAIT!!! Cont. 
A85

CINDY 
(ANGRY) X You steal my car, rip the seat out, then kidnap me. You make me miss my hair appointment. You beg me to help you and your daughter, which I very kindly do. You get me into a shoot-out where people are getting killed and blood is spurting out all over the place... 
EXT. COLDWATER - NIGHT 128 
Gun in hand, Sully crawls dazedly out of the destroyed car. Matrix approaches, kicks the gun out of Sully's hand and picks the gun up. Matrix empties Sully's pockets and finds his wallet and a motel key. He picks Sully up, an ankle in each hand, so that he's holding Sully upside down. He begins walking with him. 
MATRIX Where is she, Sully? 
SULLY Fuck you... Matrix is approaching the Sunbeam as Cindy is getting out. He swings Sully by the heels and BEATS Sully's head against the fender, leaving another dent in the already beat-up car. 
CINDY That's my car, Matrix!! Matrix continues to carry Sully upside down. 
MATRIX I can't hear you, Sully. 
SULLY 
FUCK YOU!! 
MATRIX Loyalty is touching, Sully, but it's not important in your life right now... 
VERY WIDE ANGLE 132 We SEE Matrix walk right up to the edge of a steep drop along Mulholland Drive. He has walked out of Cindy's sight. X 
Â¢ MATRIX But take gravity... He extends his arms and DANGLES Sully upside-down over the sharp drop. The Los Angeles Basin is spread out below, 180 degrees of twinkling lights. 
MATRIX Gravity is very important in your life right now. Cont. 
A8 5 
REVISED - "COMMANDO" - 4/24/85 39 132 Cont. Sully tries to thrash about as the blood rushing to his face starts to redden it. Matrix lets go with his right arm. Sully's head drops a foot, Matrix's left arm drops a little, then adjusts to the new weight. 
SULLY Uhhhh... 
MATRIX I have to warn you, Sully... 
(TAPPING IT) This is my weak arm. 
SULLY 
(DEFIANT) You can't kill me, Matrix. You X need me to find your daughter. 
MATRIX Where is she? He SHAKES Sully, moving him like a fish on a line. 
SULLY I don't know, but Cooke knows. I could take you where I'm supposed to meet him. 
MATRIX But you won't. 
SULLY Why not? Matrix uses his right hand to take something from his pocket and he dangles it in front of Sully. It's Sully's motel key. 
MATRIX Because I already know where. Fear starts to show in Sully's face for the first time as he STARES at the key. He tried to grab at the key, X but Matrix pulls it out of his reach. 
MATRIX Remember when I promised to kill you last, Sully? Cont. 
A85 
REVISED - "COMMANDO" - 4/24/85 39-A 132 Cont.l Hope flickers in Sully's eyes. 
MATRIX I'm sorry I got you involved in this. 
CINDY Then why won't you tell me what it's about. Matrix reaches into his pocket, pulls out his wallet, opens it and hands it to Cindy. 
MATRIX It's about her. Cindy looks at a photo tucked into a wallet, clear plastic photo insert. 
INSERT - PHOTO 136-C X It's a color photo of Jenny. 
TWO SHOT 136-D X 
CINDY Is she the one that was kidnapped? Matrix nods. 
MATRIX Some people are using her to force me to do a job. If I don't get to her soon, they'll kill her. 
CINDY Did you do the job? 
MATRIX No. I knew they'd kill her even if I did it. The only chance she has is if I get to her before they know what I'm doing. Cindy looks at the photo. 
CINDY Is her mother -- Cont. 
A85 
REVISED - "COMMANDO" - 4/24/85 41-A 136-D Cont. 
MATRIX She died when Jenny was born. I was in Laos when it happened, so I came home intending to raise her. 
(PAUSING) But on her third birthday I was in Lebanon. When she went to grade school, I was in Angola. When she had the measles, I was in Pakistan. And now she's been kidnapped because of me. 
CINDY Why were you always travelling? 
MATRIX I was on special assignment. 
CINDY You mean like in the Army or something? 
MATRIX Or something. 
CINDY What did you do? 
MATRIX Things you don't want to know about. Things I sometimes wish I didn't know about. He looks over at Cindy, then looks away.

A85 
ADJOINING ROOM A twenty-year-old couple in bed look up in shock as Matrix and Cooke bounce off their bed and SLAM against the wall. BLAM! The gun FIRES, SHATTERING the mirror above the young couple and they SCRAMBLE to safety on the floor on the other side of the bed. Matrix and Cooke come off the wall and SLAM onto the floor, the gun coming out of Matrix's hand. Cooke picks it up before Matrix can reach it. Cooke points the gun right at Matrix's face, pulls back the trigger, then smiles. 
COOKE Fuck you, asshole. He pulls the trigger. CLICK. No more bullets in the bun. The blood drains from Cooke's face. Matrix looks at him. 
MATRIX Fuck you, asshole... He BLASTS Cooke in the jaw and Cooke goes backward through the broken door and falls to the floor. 
ORIGINAL ROOM Matrix races back through the broken door, starts toward Cooke, then stops cold. Cooke has fallen on the broken, sharp table leg and the leg goes into his back and comes out of his chest. Cont. 
A85 
143 Cont. Matrix bends down to the barely alive Cooke. 
MATRIX Where is she, Cooke? Cooke looks blankly back at him. 
MATRIX Cooke... Cooke!! Cooke's eyes go cold and still. He's dead. Cindy approaches and swallows as she looks down at his body, the stake coming out of his chest. Matrix starts emptying Cooke's pockets. There's a wallet containing only cash. Matrix tosses it to the floor. He brings out a lighter and a package of cigarettes, examines the lighter, then tosses both objects to the floor. He pulls out two keys on a key chain. They're car keys. Matrix leaps to his feet. 
MATRIX Come on! 
EXT. MOTEL PARKING LOT - NIGHT 144

MATRIX You sure? 
CINDY I'm getting my pilot's license. Coastal is where my instructor gets his fuel.

MATRIX Why'd you decide to get a pilot's license? 
CINDY My father was an Air Force pilot. That's why I becarle a stewardess. But after a while, I got tired of serving food' and drinks. I wanted to fly the plane myself.

MATRIX Can you get under the radar? 
CINDY Not marine radar, but if we get close enough to the water, the high seas effect might camouflage us.

Matrix rises and SMASHES his rifle butt into Bennett's face. 
CUT BACK TO: 
EXT. BEACH - DAY 392 
Bennett's crazed mind returns to the present. 
MATRIX Let her go, Bennett and I'll give you a chance to twist that knife into me. The stern of the boat continues to burn as Bennett considers what Matrix said.

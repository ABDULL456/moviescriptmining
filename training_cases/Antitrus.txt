"ANTITRUST" 
Screenplay by 
Howard Franklin 
SHOOTING DRAFT 
ON A BLACK SCREEN 
it says: "The coolest thing?" 
VOICE Wow. That's hard. I'd have to say it's the day we launched Outpost 
We hear a (famous) Seattle alternative band. 
EXT. OUTPOST CAMPUS - DAY (BEGIN MAIN TITLES) 
Quick cuts, seductive angles: 70 hot-air balloons rise over a vast, green corporate campus. Their mylar skins are imprinted with Outpost '98 logos; their gondolas are dressed in Outpost-colored bunting. 
18,000 Outpost employees cheer. They're spread out over rolling lawns, amid Arabian tents and costumed Acrobats. Over the balloon-dotted sky, the graphic re-appears: "The coolest thing?" 
DIFFERENT VOICE (DARYL) It's the beverages. 
INT. OUTPOST OFFICE - DAY (CONTINUE TITLES & MUSIC) 
A Programmer sits in his handsome office, forested landscape out the window. The screen says: DARYL, M.I.T. '95 
DARYL Gary always makes sure we've got the coolest stuff to drink. 
JUMP CUTS of tall refrigerators: Snapples, Cokes, Fruitopias, Zaps, Jolts, Barques & Sprites are lined-up behind glass doors. "The coolest thing?" 
DIFFERENT VOICE (DIANA) Knowing your work means something. 
INT. OUTPOST CAMPUS - DAY (CONTINUE TITLES & MUSIC) 
A 24-year-old Korean-American Girl sits at the edge of a plashing, post-modern fountain. DIANA, STANFORD '97 
DIANA (V.O.) Knowing everywhere in the world, this is the software people use. 
MONTAGE of world capitals & remote places: Stockbrokers & Farmers, News Anchors & Students, CEO's & Eskimos boot-up Outpost '98, or log-on with Outpost Internet Traveler. 
DIANA (V.O.) 20 years ago, Gary had an idea, that's all he had. And now the company's bigger than IBM. 
Over the last shot (a Ghetto Kid uses Outpost Word in the library): "The coolest thing?" 
VOICE (V.O.) It's the people. Which is weird. 
EXT. COFFEE HOUSE/TERRACE - DAY (CONTINUE TITLES & MUSIC) 
A Programmer sits with two colleagues, drinking latt√©s at the edge of Lake Washington. MITCH, BERKELEY, '98 
MITCH Big companies are s'posed to be impersonal. 
MONTAGE: Programmers play competitive games at an Outpost picnic; Toddlers play on computers in an Outpost Day Care Center; Geeks confer at a diagram-covered whiteboard; Employees listen/dance to the Seattle band we've been hearing, on-stage, at the Outpost '98 launch. 
MITCH (V.O.) There's this myth that doing a start- up is cooler. But there's no community with a start-up. No permanence. 
BACK TO SCENE: COFFEE HOUSE/TERRACE (CONTINUE TITLES) 
One of Mitch's colleagues is nodding. DONNY, HARVARD, '97 
DONNY It bums me out when the media say we're cultish, or whatever. Why? 'Cause we care about each other? 
Donny didn't mean to sound so mushy. Nobody knows where to look for a second. 
MITCH 'Love you too, bro. 
As they laugh: "The coolest thing?" 
VOICE (TERRY) I'll tell you what's not cool. 
TERRY How Gary gets this superbad rap. 
MONTAGE of magazine covers (Newsweek, Vanity Fair, WIRED) featuring Gary Boyd. They say, eg: "Who Owns Cyberspace?" On a Time cover, he's composited by the Capitol Dome: "ROBBER BARON OR VISIONARY? Outpost's Antitrust Woes" 
TERRY (V.O.) There's this prejudice against super- smart people. People like Gary. 
GARY (early 40's) reads a statement before a Congressional Sub-Committee. His voice is pleasant but firm: 
GARY A kid working in his garage can create the next Outpost, the new IBM. All it takes is a great idea. 
A bloated Senator looks hostile. 
GARY That's why nobody can have a monopoly in a business built on ideas. 
As we watch, CAMERA pulls back from the screen on which the movie is being projected. REVERSE INTO: 
INT. COLLEGE AUDITORIUM - EVENING (END MAIN TITLES) 
Over an audience of 40 or so computer students we read: 
STANFORD UNIVERSITY 
BRIAN He's my god. I hear he actually calls recruits sometimes. Or is that an Urban Legend? 
REDMOND Gary's running the biggest software company in the world, Brian. He's being harassed by the Justice Department, and he's got a new baby. 
Across the room, Milo (eating chips, perusing code) reaches for a napkin but unwittingly grabs some bunting. It unravels in a long TP-like streamer -- just as Danny approaches, peering at Milo's ID tag. 
DANNY Milo? I'm Danny. 
MILO Oh hi. 
He tries to sluff the paper off his hand; Danny holds out a cell phone. 
DANNY Gary would like to speak to you? 
Milo and Teddy look at each other: right. But Danny looks like he means it. Milo's grin fades. He takes the phone. 
MILO ...Hello? 
GARY (ON THE PHONE) Milo? Gary Boyd. I'm hoping you and your friend can come up here. We've made some amazing strides in digital convergence. I'd love to show them to you. 
MILO You would? Wow. When would we come? (he waits; he looks up) 'Think he hung up. 
Danny holds out two plane tickets, in 1st class folders. 
INT. UNIVERSITY AVENUE DINER (PALO ALTO) - NIGHT 
Alice examines one of the tickets almost suspiciously. 
ALICE But how does he know that's what you guys're working on? 
Larry, Teddy & Brian are at the table with Alice & Milo. It's a student hang-out, with loud music. 
MILO All the companies know. The faculties tell 'em. At the target schools. 
LARRY In exchange for endowments. They should just drop the pretense and name the schools after 'em. 
BRIAN (to Teddy) I can't believe you refused a ticket! 
TEDDY My parents're already freaked-out I'm staying here. 50 miles from Chinatown. 
BRIAN Well maybe if you told 'em how much money you'd be making -- (to Milo) You're going up there. Right? 
LARRY I think you should go. 
MILO (amazed) You do? 
LARRY I mean, it's your life. 
As Alice predicted, Milo is pleased by Larry's remark. "Empowered." Larry smiles conspiratorially at Alice. 
INT. MILO & ALICE'S APARTMENT - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT 
In a tidy, playfully decorated room, Alice stirs in bed, sees the space next to her is vacant. 
TINY ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Milo sits at a desk, thinking, agitated, in the dim light of a PC. He looks up, sees Alice in the doorway. 
MILO I think I kind of lost it. I was just so thrilled to be talking to the richest, most powerful... 'Didn't know I even cared about that stuff. 
ALICE C'mon, how often do you talk to somebody who's been on the cover of Time. Three of four times. 
She picks her way through geek clutter (motherboards, code manuals, Coke cans) sits next to him. 
MILO A lot of what Larry says is true. They just clone stuff, or reverse engineer it, and everybody gets stuck with their inferior version cause they -- 
ALICE Then you've gotta ask him about that. 
He looks at her: you've gotta be kidding. 
ALICE It's important. 
MILO If he's really a bully, he won't cop to it, anyway. 
ALICE Bully? Are we talking about Gary Boyd? Or your dad. 
He doesn't deny it: she sees right through him. 
MILO When I was a kid? And he was moving us all over the place? I spent all my time writing stuff on Outpost 1.0. I thought Gary Boyd was the greatest. 
ALICE But he's not quite the same guy anymore. Don't get your hopes too high? 
INT. 737 - FIRST CLASS CABIN - DAY 
In the cabin, everybody types on a notebook but Milo. He looks out the window expectantly: at the Seattle skyline. 
INT. SEA-TAC AIRPORT - GATE 13 - DAY 
Milo comes off the plane. Danny and Redmond greet him. 
INT/EXT. HIGHWAY/CAR - DAY 
Redmond drives his black Lexus 85 m.p.h. Danny leans forward from the backseat. 
MILO You know he's never been anybody's counselor before? 
ALICE Milo! What about --? 
She gestures at what she hopes will be their home. 
MILO Oh, It's great. It's great! (they start to kiss, but:) 'Think I should tell him I learned everything using 1.0? Maybe I could show him one of my early programs. 
She pulls him back into the kiss. 
MONTAGE W/ MUSIC 
1.) MILO types intently in his office. 
2.) GARY sits with MILO at his desk, discussing code. Pan to the window; we see a different pair of awed Geeks. 
3.) Milo & Alice read in bed. He's reading Gary's book. 
4.) MILO shows GARY one of his early programs, written on 1.0.: it's simple-looking, with some childish writing scrawled on it. Gary seems touched. 
INT. OUTPOST CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 
Two DOJ AGENTS depose Gary. (A video-cam records his answers.) Two Outpost LAWYERS sit next to him. One of the Agents is reading from a document: 
DOJ AGENT "Infotek's urgent need to license Outpost Office is such that we can use it as a tool in the current negotiation." (looks up) When you wrote the word "tool," what'd you mean by it? 
Gary studies his copy of the E-mail. He looks vexed. 
GARY I don't remember. 
DOJ AGENT What d'you think you meant by it? 
GARY I'm confused. Am I supposed to speculate under oath? 
The Agent shifts in his seat. We get an idea of Gary's negotiating skill (making the other party look unreasonable, while offering nothing). 
OTHER AGENT Since you didn't have an answer to that question, Mr. Boyd -- 
GARY ("confused" again) Didn't I? Have an answer? "I don't remember." 
The Agents confer. Gary sees Phil, looming outside the open door. One of the Agents sees him, too. He doesn't try to hide his annoyance: 
DOJ AGENT Did you wanna take a break, Mr. Boyd? 
INT. AN OFFICE - A MOMENT LATER 
Gary takes a manila envelope from Phil, opens it. 
PHIL Your protege's moving so fast we can barely keep up with him. 
Gary reads the page from the envelope: computer code. 
GARY This is good. Who did it? 
PHIL 'Start-up not 50 miles from here. Kid's on Prozac. 
GARY Maybe we should all get on it. 
INT. MILO'S OFFICE - DAY 
Milo stares at his screen, frustrated. Gary enters. 
GARY How's it going? 
MILO Maybe I'm going too fast. 
GARY (sharply; incredulous) Too fast? At least four companies're on the verge of workable convergence systems, Milo, they -- 
Catching himself, Gary trails off. He sits down, exhales. 
GARY Even when I had a hand in every aspect of the company I knew the one thing you can never control is somebody's creative process. 
Gary seems sincerely contrite. (He needn't be: Milo just wants to please him. Besides: Milo sees he'd like to stop obsessing about convergence, to be a "worldly zillionaire," engrossed in his hobbies; but, after all, what could be more engrossing than Skywire?) 
MILO It's okay. Really. 
GARY (reaching into his pocket) Take a look at this. Slightly different approach. 
Reading the page Gary got from Phil, Milo knits his brow. 
MILO You did this -- overnight? 
GARY You're making me young again. 
INT. LISA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
PAN OFF a TV, where local news footage shows a mangled, smoking BMW, post-wreck, on a lonely nocturnal highway. 
NEWS VOICE ...A graduate of MIT, he was on the antidepressant Prozac, and had been warned not to drink and drive. (Etc.) 
Lisa watches the news report, knowingly. 
INT. BUILDING 20 HALLWAY - DAY 
Still distracted, he finds a page of code on his desk, gives it to Milo. Once again, Milo marvels. 
MILO You really wrote this just today? 
GARY (dark, unsmiling) What're you implying. 
MILO (taken aback) Nothing! 
Their eyes are locked. Gary blinks, sags into his chair. 
GARY Everything I do is under scrutiny. The questions they ask, trying to make anything strategic look sordid. (knits his brow) I'm confused. Doesn't everybody in business try to get ahead? 
MILO (uncomfortable) I'm sure. 
GARY The purpose of this company isn't to destroy our competitors any more than the purpose of living is to breath. But the software business is binary: you're a zero or a one. Being obsessive isn't a crime. It's a character trait. 
Milo just wants to get out. He studies the code to hide his discomfort. Gary watches him. 
GARY It scales, don't you think? 
MILO Definitely. 
He smiles. For the first time it looks forced. 
INT. SEATTLE RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
A youthfully upscale place, a converted red-brick warehouse. Alice looks great. The Waiter pours wine. 
ALICE This feels fairly grown up, I'd say. 
Milo smiles (again it looks forced) raises his glass. 
MILO To our new life. (she's looking at him) ...What's wrong? 
ALICE That's what I need to ask you. (when he says nothing) You know you can't keep anything from me. 
MILO He gave me some new code-fixes this morning. I said, "Did you really do this just today?" Cause I was impressed. He said "What're you implying?" 
She just looks at him. He grows a little defensive: 
MILO It's the way he said it. Just the way my dad did, when he was caught in a lie. That's how you knew you were onto something ugly. 
ALICE (just confused) What would it mean, anyway? If he didn't write it? 
MILO That's what I'm asking myself. Does he have some genius stowed away? Why not let him write Skywire. (upset) 'Not saying it makes sense. 
A Busboy leaves a basket of rolls. Glum, preoccupied, Milo takes one without looking, brings it to his lips -- 
ALICE Milo! 
He looks at Alice, looks at the roll, blanches. 
MILO I'm so stupid. 
He throws the roll back into the basket. 
ALICE He's your boss. He's not your -- 
MILO (he's nodding) I know, I know. 
ALICE If you can't deal with him on that basis, you better get a new counselor. 
MILO (the very idea hurts) Isn't that -- extreme? 
ALICE What's extreme is what that ER doctor said when he pumped your stomach. Eat another sesame seed and that's it. 
We see the rolls: covered in seeds. 
ALICE I mean, if one little comment from Gary is gonna upset you this much -- 
MILO You're right. It's -- a working relationship. Don't know what I was expecting. 
He smiles. But his heart's not in it. She hates to see him suffer. She picks up her glass. 
ALICE C'mon. Let's do the toast? 
EXT. TERRACE OUTSIDE CAFETERIA - DAY 
Milo sits alone, marking up pages of code as he eats. He doesn't notice Lisa, standing with her tray. 
LISA Did you wanna be alone? 
MILO No. Please. 
He indicates she should sit. 
LISA They just pushed up the schedule on Skywire apps. How fast are you going? 
MILO "There is no second place." Plus every time I get jammed-up, Gary has an inspiration. (looks at her, curious) Is it like that with your counselor? 
LISA Mine's not the CEO. He barely remembers to take a shower. 
MILO Right, right. But does he ever just, like, hand you code? 
EXT. BUILDING #20 QUAD - DAY 
Through a window, we watch Milo traverse the quad. 
GARY (O.S.) What'd the girl say? 
PHIL There may be a little less trust after your outburst. 
We are 
INT. GARY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
Gary turns back inside, where Phil reads Milo's new code. 
PHIL Hasn't affected his work, though. 
GARY Nothing does. Still. I want him to like me. 
Phil is confused by Gary's sincerity; so is Gary. 
EXT. BUILDING #20 PARKING LOT - EVENING 
Desi and another Geek watch in astonishment: Gary walks Milo to his car, his arm circled over Milo's shoulder. He seems to be -- apologizing. 
EXT./INT. MILO & ALICE'S HOUSE - EVENING 
Milo comes eagerly up the path: can't wait to tell Alice what just happened. He enters -- pulls up short. Alice is waiting for him. She's white. 
MILO ...What's wrong? 
She doesn't know how to say it. 
MILO What! 
ALICE Teddy was killed last night. 
MILO What're you -- what? 
ALICE It was a hate crime. 
Milo is staggered. She moves to him... 
ALICE I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. 
He hangs onto her, for support. 
EXT. SUNNYVALE LOFT BLDG. (SILICON VALLEY) - DAY 
Establish the funky building, vestiges of police tape on the door, a limo and many cars parked out front. 
INT. LOFT - MAIN FLOOR - CONTINUOUS 
A mixture of Teddy's relatives and Computer Friends have gathered. In the BG, Teddy's Dad weeps volubly. 
INT. TEDDY'S WORKSPACE - CONTINUOUS 
Teddy's brother, NELSON, shows Milo the workspace: red Stanford pennant, rubber trees on the desk. Milo, in a suit, peers at the painted-over epithet on the wall. 
NELSON They trashed his hard disk, all his back-ups. Nothing's left. 
MILO They caught the guys? 
Nelson shows Milo a San Jose Mercury: mugshots of two skin- headed Aryan Nations Members in their 20's. 
NELSON It's an airtight case. They found the weapon with Teddy's blood on it and their fingerprints. They'd been arrested twice for beating-up Asians. How come they weren't in jail? 
Milo unpins a picture of himself & Teddy from a board. 
MILO He told me about the break-in. He didn't seem to take it that seriously. 
NELSON You guys don't take anything seriously do you? That's not on a hard drive? 
Milo is stung by this. Alice appears in the doorway. 
ALICE Nelson? Your mom wants you. It's time to go to scatter the ashes. 
Milo is pinning the picture back up. The pushpin falls to the floor, he kneels to retrieve it. On the floorboards, he sees a thin, shiny plastic filament. He picks it up. 
MILO I didn't know he was working with fiber optics. 
But when he looks up, Nelson's gone. 
ALICE We gotta go too, honey. 
As he heads out with Alice, he unthinkingly stuffs the filament in his suit pocket. 
EXT. BLUFF OVER THE PACIFIC - DAY 
A raw beautiful bluff. The sea stretches to infinity behind a smaller group of Mourners. A LAY MINISTER intones the Lord's Prayer. 
EXT. BLUFF - LATER 
Milo approaches Larry with trepidation. Larry nods, it's okay. They hug each other. They walk slowly back toward the cars. 
MILO Gotta go home. 'Think I ate something. 
INT./EXT. MILO'S CAR/OUTPOST PARKING LOT - DAY 
Pulling out of the lot, Milo seizes the car phone. He hits HOME on the speed-dial. Gets a busy signal. Rings off. He's about to press re-dial when he sees the Outpost logo branded on the receiver. 
He throws it down like it's contaminated. 
EXT. MILO & ALICE'S HOUSE - DAY 
Middle-of-the-day sounds: chirping birds, school children. Milo pulls to the curb at a bad angle. 
EXT. INT./FRONT DOOR/FOYER - DAY 
He fumbles with his keys. When he gets inside: 
MILO Alice? Alice! 
He moves into the bedroom. He sees her through the window, painting in the studio. 
EXT./INT. BACK GARDEN/STUDIO - MOMENT LATER 
He stands outside the studio. Waits for her to look up. She does. She smiles. Then she sees something's wrong. He waits for her to come out here, where it's safe to speak. 
EXT. BACK GARDEN - LATER 
He paces, agitated. She watches him. She's skeptical, but doesn't want to appear unsympathetic. 
ALICE Are you saying you think they had something to do with his death? Nelson said it was an airtight case. 
MILO I don't know what I'm saying. Maybe -- maybe they hired those guys. 
ALICE I can't see Outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that. 
MILO I don't know! I just know it was Teddy's code. All these ideas flying in from everywhere. You know how he says "Any kid working in his garage can put us out of business?" It's like they know what every kid's doing. 
ALICE They hack into people's programs? 
MILO Nobody does work like this on-line. It's in your PC, or in a mainframe. Self-contained. They'd have to be, like, watching people. Physically. (he freezes) Oh Jesus. 
INT. BEDROOM - A MOMENT LATER 
Milo's at the closet, rummaging among the clothes hanging there. Alice comes up behind him. He finds his suit jacket. He digs in one pocket, then another. He finds the fiber optic strand (from Teddy's floor). Shows it to her. 
MILO (almost silently) It's a camera. 
EXT. BACK GARDEN - AGAIN 
They've trooped back outside. She's worried she's indulging his paranoia. 
MILO It isn't a broadcast studio. It's -- a surveillance post or something. That's why they have the dishes on top. 
ALICE You're scaring me. I think we should just go. 
MILO Go where? You can't get away from people like this. 
ALICE "Like this?" It's Gary you're talking about. 
MILO (it really hurts) You think I don't know that? 
ALICE Milo. Why would he -- 
MILO How should I know? "Solving a problem," I guess. Or needing to control everything. I don't know. (can't think about it) I've gotta get in there. 
ALICE Even if all this were true. There're 20 other buildings. All of them filled with computers and -- 
MILO It's the only one with dishes on the roof. The studio's a front. That's why they keep postponing its opening. (muttered, obsessive) ...gotta get in there. 
ALICE Milo, you told me those DOJ Agents are all over the place. How could they hope to hide a surveillance post? (as he mulls this) And how can you get in there, anyway? With the cameras and the swipe cards -- 
MILO I can't just walk away! 
ALICE You can't just walk in, either. 
MILO They stop the construction work at six or seven. The parking lot's mostly clear by two or three in the morning. Even the early Geeks don't get there before five. 
ALICE Is it two? Or is it three? Have you ever really noticed? 
He knows what she's saying: he's unqualified for this, a space-cadet. She tries to hold him. But he wriggles away. 
MILO No! I can't just keep my head in the sand. That's how I got into this mess. 
He paces, he thinks. She watches him, worried. 
MILO I know how to get in there. But you've gotta help me. 
ALICE (scared, reluctant) ...Whaddo I do? 
MILO So you believe me? 
She can't lie. She shakes her head. 
ALICE Just tell me what to do. 
Panning off the civil defense sign we find Shrot standing at a closet, examining a piece of the alarm clock. 
INT. PHYSICAL SECURITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
Milo is at work, bringing up schematic screens, diagnosing the system with his unique concentration. 
Panning to the window, we see the evacuated Programmers enjoying themselves on the lawn. It's a rare, exciting event: they jump around, miming explosions. 
INT. SERVICE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 
Shrot and the Guard collect pieces of the bomb out of the debris, puts them in a tray. 
INT. PHYSICAL SECURITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
Milo brings up the screen that controls the #21 cameras. On the monitors, he sees nothing very interesting: a hallway, a room under construction... 
He pulls down a menu. RECORDING is highlighted. He clicks PLAYBACK. The image hardly changes, but a Guard wanders through. He types, the tape rewinds (the Guard moves backwards). He finds a neutral spot (showing an empty hallway), stops the tape. 
INT. SERVICE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 
Gary, Randy & Phil approach Shrot; Gary stares at him. 
RANDY What is it? 
SHROT Not much. Glorified cherry bomb. Right by the civil defense sign? Some geek's idea of irony. I been saying we need a camera in this hall. 
RANDY There's nothing in this hall. Someone's pulling your chain, as usual. 
SHROT (thinking aloud) Unless it's a diversion. Milo's in my office. He was tailgating, so I -- 
Gary explodes, with incredulity. 
GARY Milo? Try to have a clue. Try to think. 
Gary strides off. Shrot feels unfairly maligned. 
RANDY That kid's the great white hope. 
SHROT I could get it out of him. 
RANDY You're not listening. 
Randy and Phil head up the hall. Shrot watches them. Even if his "intellectual superiors" are convinced of Milo's innocence, he isn't. 
He walks swiftly back toward his office. Then he runs. 
INT. PHYSICAL SECURITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
Milo reads a warning message. DOWNLOADING PLAYBACK STREAM TO RECORD CYCLE WILL CAUSE BIT OVERLOAD. DO YOU WISH TO PROCEED? Y/N. He types Y. 
The glitch freezes the tape (we see it lock into place): it shows the empty hallway. 
INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 
They've let the Programmers back in. They head up the hall as Shrot heads down it. He pushes past them gruffly. 
He knows he's enhancing his Neanderthal image (they make cracks) but he's more interested in obeying his instinct. 
INT. PHYSICAL SECURITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
Milo immobilizes another camera in #21... and another. 
INT. HALLWAY CONTINUOUS 
Shrot rounds the corner. His office is in view, now. 
INT. PHYSICAL SECURITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
Milo, at the keyboard, closes up windows, one by one. 
INT. SECURITY OUTER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
Shrot is back, he has only to round the corner to see Milo. We assume his POV as he does so: 
Milo sits in the chair where Shrot left him. 
MILO Everything okay? 
INT. MILO'S OFFICE - NIGHT 
Pan off the clock (3:20 AM) to find Milo at his desk, looking at the clock with a certain dread. It's time. 
EXT. BLDG. 20 QUAD - NIGHT 
Milo walks the path between the two buildings, fiddling nervously with the dummied swipe card. 
Hearing footfalls behind him, he whirls: it's a Geek loping to his car. He smiles. Milo smiles: waits, walks on. 
Nearing #21, Milo looks around, making sure no one else is around. His POV (panning): A Programmer works late, visible through a lighted window in #20... The dog sculpture with cocked ears sits atop the Day Care, its quizzical expression seeming to wonder what Milo is up to... The Geek he just saw racing by on foot now pulls out of the parking lot in his James Bond BMW... 
Milo arrives at the entrance. Heart pounding, he brings the card to the slot. Will he trigger that awful alarm? 
He slides the card, the door clicks. 
INT. DAY CARE CENTER - CONTINUOUS 
He steps in on colorful carpeting, amid balls & tricycles. Kid's artwork hangs on the wall. He moves through this room, into the 
COMPUTER ROOM 
20 screens glow. They hang suspended over a wide, ringed table, a chair at each keyboard. Indeed, Gary has spared no expense for the toddlers: they're flat, sleek, digital screens. At the moment, they show colorful, childish contour drawings that say WHERE I WANNA WORK (e.g.: a spaceship). There are a dozen more screens on tables at the perimeter of the room showing screensavers (eg: angelfish swimming). 
Milo moves slowly around the table, studying the screens. Not surprisingly, most of the WHERE I WANNA WORK drawings are of desks or tables with computers. 
Tracking just ahead of Milo, we get to a screen that shows a workstation with a red pennant on the wall, a rubber plant at each end of a desk. Even in contour form it's -- familiar. Milo passes it. And comes back to it. 
Staring at it, he sits. He begins typing. [The drawing still occupies the screen, but in a window he's brought up at the bottom, there is dense, DOS-looking code.] He types furiously -- numbers, symbols, backslashes. Whatever he's trying to do is a challenge even to him. He deletes lines, begins anew, his frustration evident. 
As he works through the layers of code, the pixels on the screen start to fill in. The contour lines slowly dissolve into a live broadcast image of Teddy's workstation in Sunnyvale (eerily empty, now). 
When all the pixels have fallen into place, Milo hears CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK from every direction, as all the screens in the room fill in with live broadcast images. All of them show variations on a theme: 
A workstation seen by a camera over-the-shoulder of a programmer (if he were present). The stations are of various shapes and sizes, but in each case we have an unobstructed view of screen & keyboard. At this hour, few programmers are present. One guy has fallen asleep, his head on a desk. A Japanese Geek is hard at work: it's day there. 
INT. PHIL'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
Phil and Randy work at the coffee table. 
PHIL Did you download Corey? In San Jose? 
RANDY Damn. 'Have to go back over there. (he stands, stretches) Be so much easier if we could walk in the front door. 
PHIL You don't look anything like a three- year-old. 
INT. DAY CARE - COMPUTER ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Milo works the keyboard. Again, the code gets dense and obscure as he goes deeper. He succeeds in calling-up a graphical interface. Among the menus he can choose from are: TARGET SCHOOLS, PD UPLOADS, RX UPLOADS. 
He clicks Target Schools, a menu shoots down (Berkeley, Cal Tech, etc.). He clicks Stanford, then Chin, Teddy. Two windows open. In one, there is a video stream of Teddy winning an award in the Gate's Bldg. In the other, uploaded police video stenciled SUNNYVALE PD) of the White Supremacists whose mug- shots we saw in the San Jose Mercury; they're being interrogated. 
In the first window, Teddy's image dissolves into a handheld crime-scene video (marked SV-PD) of a ransacked grocery store. "DIE GOOK!" is painted on a wall. Milo looks confused: some "narrative" is unfolding, but it remains obscure without audio. 
He types some more. 
In the bottom window, he brings up convoluted text regarding the audio. About the only phrases we can understand are: "Audio Block ON" and "Hardware Requirement: Magnetic Filter Type PBX-R17." 
His eyes cast about the room for some suitable hardware substitute. He digs in his shirt pocket. He takes out his swipe card, studies it. He casts about some more, till he sees some kids' safety scissors in a jar. 
INT. BUILDING 20 - SERVICE HALL - CONTINUOUS 
Randy whistles as he heads up the hall. Arriving at the door with the Civil Defense sticker, he swipes his card. 
INT. DAY CARE COMPUTER ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
On-screen, long-lens footage shows a low building; the Aryan Nations suspects come out of it. A still photo appears in the 2nd window: a steel hasp. 
Milo's eyes are narrowed: what am I seeing? Meantime, he is reaching under the table where he has removed a plate from the mainframe terminal, exposing hardware within. 
He has trimmed the swipe card to size and is wedging its magnetic strip into a metal slot. He wiggles the card. We hear an eerie fibrillation, which flattens into the voice of a serene, eminently sane female: 
MULTIMEDIA NARRATOR -- run this methamphetamine lab known to Federal Authorities, per ND 47, from which we removed the implement, fingerprints intact. 
Crime-scene video streams in now stenciled FBI by the time/date). A handheld camera pans a blood-spattered wall then shows a mutilated Asian murder victim. (All of this footage is made even eerier by the jerky glitches always present in streaming video, and its sinister graininess.) 
MULTIMEDIA NARRATOR FBI footage, procured by ND 47, shows the aftermath of an Aryan Nations' killing in Denver. Note the evidence of torture, which is typical. 
Milo pales as he realizes he is watching a primer on how racial killings are done. 
He hears a creaking noise behind him, and whirls. 
It's the classroom hamster, on his wheel. 
INT. STAIRWELL/BOMB SHELTER - CONTINUOUS 
Still whistling, Randy descends some metal stairs, enters a vast bomb shelter (canned foods, etc.) 
INT. DAY CARE - COMPUTER ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Milo has tapped into his own file: footage of him lecturing at Stanford (as an RA), pointing to a whiteboard. 
MULTIMEDIA NARRATOR -- complete immersion in code-writing renders him both unobservant and suggestible [click]. On two occasions he went truant from classes to attend Comix Conventions. 
The audio crackles and drops out again. Milo's eyes narrow: he sees video of Alice, sitting on a folding chair, speaking to someone. She has a harder look, pulls on a Marlboro. 
What's he seeing? He wiggles the jerry-rigged hardware almost urgently, till the narration crackles back on: 
MULTIMEDIA NARRATOR -- Rebecca P, a Connecticut art stu- dent facing Federal drug charges, whose records were supplied to us by N.D. 47. 
He hears her voice under the Narration, answering an unseen Interrogator (sounds like Phil). It's a job interview. Milo subtly, unconsciously shakes his head, as if to deny what his eyes see. The narration begins to fibrillate, again: 
MULTIMEDIA NARRATOR (O.S.) Armed with his personal files, she was easily able to ingratiate herself with the socially maladroit Milo -- 
The audio drops out as Milo sees uploaded medical files and ER photos of himself marked STANFORD MEDICAL CENTER: he's waxen, bloated, gasping for breath. With a certain dread, Milo jams the card in deeper: 
MULTIMEDIA NARRATOR ...she planted the sesame seed both to test the extent of his proclivity and to provide a bonding experience, since she would quote "save his life." 
Milo is devastated, disbelieving. Now he sees real-time ER footage: an Allergy Victim, bloated, twitching, gasping, dying... 
EXT./INT. MILO'S CAR/STREET - DAWN 
Milo sits in his idling car, staring at his own house, up the street. How can he go in there? 
He puts the car in gear, does a U-Turn. 
EXT. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE - SEATTLE - EARLY MORNING 
The Deux Chevaux is parked on the street outside a government building. Not many people are around, yet. A Janitor hoses down the sidewalk. 
INT. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE - RECEPTION AREA MORNING 
Milo slides a business card across a reception desk. It's the one the rumpled Prosecutor, Lyle Barton, gave him that day in Palo Alto. 
MILO (O.S.) He gave me this. 'Said I should come see him if -- 
DOJ RECEPTIONIST He's not in yet. 
MILO Can I wait in his office? 
DOJ RECEPTIONIST It's locked, dear. 
He looks over his shoulder, then back again, frightened. 
MILO Please. 
DOJ RECEPTIONIST Wait in his outer office. 
INT. BARTON'S OUTER OFFICE - MORNING 
Milo sits on a wooden bench, foot tapping. Hearing Barton's voice, he comes to his feet. Barton enters with a Co-Worker, holding a container of coffee, discussing the particulars of a case. 
CO-WORKER Do I make the call, or do you? 
Milo is relieved the second he sees Barton's kindly face. 
MILO Mr. Barton, do you remember me? 
BARTON ...It's -- Milo, isn't it? 
MILO Yes sir. I need to talk to you. 
BARTON Give me two seconds with Lacy here? (unlocks his door) Go on in, I won't be a moment. 
Milo enters as Barton finishes up with his colleague. 
BARTON (O.S.) I'll make the call, but I think you need to send a Fax first (etc.). 
INT. BARTON'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
Milo paces. He surveys framed diplomas, commendations and photos on the wall. He takes comfort in their solidity: pictures of Barton's teenage Kids, Barton and Wife at the Grand Canyon. There's a college football photo, a young Barton with his team. Milo studies it, smiles. Move in on the photo, till we see the number on Barton's Notre Dame football jersey: ND 47. 
Milo's smile fades. It takes a moment before he even hears Barton behind him. 
BARTON Milo? 
MILO Yeah. Hi. Thank you for seeing me. 
BARTON Have a seat. 
As Milo takes the seat in front of the desk (mind spinning) Barton moves to his own chair. 
BARTON What seems to be the problem? You look a little upset. 
MILO I am. I am, sir. 
What's he gonna say? 
BARTON Milo? 
MILO My friend, my best friend, Teddy, was killed in Silicon Valley. 
BARTON My goodness. 
MILO It was racially motivated. He's Chinese. He was. And... I know sometimes the FBI gets involved with that. Don't they? 
BARTON If there's a Civil Rights violation. But generally we let the local police and DA do their work first. 
MILO I -- just wanna help bring these guys to justice. They're neo-Nazis. 
BARTON Let me look into it, see what's being done. Frankly, it's not my area. 
MILO (he gets up) 'Just didn't know who else to talk to. 
BARTON (circles an arm over Milo) And Outpost? You're happy there? 
MILO Yes sir. 
INT. MILO & ALICE'S HOUSE - MORNING 
Alice is on the phone in the front room. Agitated, she puffs on a pencil (surrogate cigarette). We hear Phil through the receiver: 
PHIL (ON THE PHONE) 'Didn't mention he was going to the Justice Department? 
Milo sits across from her. He doesn't know where to start. 
LISA What's wrong? 
He looks around, wants to make sure no one's listening. He speaks very quietly. 
MILO I snuck into #21. 
LISA Why would you do a thing like -- 
MILO You thought about it too. You've been suspicious for a while. But it's not happening in there. It's happening in the Day Care. 
LISA The Day Care? 
Two Men with even features enter the restaurant. One has a laptop case slung over his shoulder. 
MILO Can we go someplace else? 
EXT. CITY PARK - NIGHT 
They're in a bandshell. The rain falls heavily, drips off the eaves. She holds the filament from Teddy's workspace. 
MILO It's easy to know who the smart geeks are, the schools tell 'em. They upload medical files, school records, pharmacy files. They'd be happy just to steal code forever. But when a program gets close to fruition. Like Teddy. He was almost there. 
LISA But why would they --? 
MILO You know. There is no second place. And what's the risk? The killings're undetectable, they're hand-tailored, they make "sense." I mean, they're in the information business. They have scenarios for all of us, too. In case we find out too much. 
She's peering at him. He reads her mind. 
MILO I'm not one of them. Not trying to "suss you out." 
She wants to believe him. 
MILO They killed my best friend! I'm living with somebody they pay to go to bed with me. Can't you trust somebody just once? I don't wanna be alone here. 
His plea is so ardent, his humanity so transparent. But she can't quite do it. 
LISA I'm sorry, Milo... I'm sorry. 
She smiles sadly as she backs away. 
MILO (forcefully) I know why you're so secretive. Why you won't let anybody near you. (quieter) I know what he did to you. 
LISA Oh yeah? 
She tries to sound tough; there are tears in her eyes. 
LISA So that's in my -- file? 
He wants to comfort her. He takes a step toward her. She shakes her head: no. 
LISA Is that my -- scenario? (when he hesitates) Tell me. 
MILO They'd frame him. 
LISA (horrified) He's out of prison? 
MILO (he nods) They're already watching you. If they had to, they'd give him this drug that mimics an alcoholic blackout. He'd wake up not even remembering his "act of revenge." 
She draws her hands to her face as the facade cracks. She weeps silently. He moves to her, carefully, slowly, seeing her fear, her trauma. He touches her shoulders. She tenses, tries to back away. 
LISA No. 
But he holds on. 
MILO Nobody's gonna hurt you. 
Slowly, he wraps his arms around her. 
She remains tense for a moment, then yields, pressing her face into his shoulder. The rain drums on the bandshell. After a moment: 
LISA ...Milo? 
MILO Hmm? 
LISA I always felt if a -- boy I liked ever found out -- he'd run. He'd think I was unclean. 
MILO No, no. Never. 
She clings to him tightly, now, the wall of her mistrust breached after all the years of pain, secrecy, shame. 
A wide shot: they hold each other, alone in the storm. 
VOICE (PHIL) All his suspicions were allayed? 
INT. LIBRARY-LIKE OFFICE - DAY 
Alice nods. She sits in front of leather-bound books. 
VOICE You're sure. 
She's at Gary's house. On the hot seat. Phil and Randy watch her. Gary does, too, but deep in shadow, behind a desk, at a remove. Rain falls heavily on the Lake. 
Gary takes the page. As he reads it over: 
GARY Why did you move around so much? When you were a kid. 
MILO ...My dad was a compulsive gambler. Only he didn't think he was. That applied to guys who didn't have a "system." "Losers," who played games of chance. He could "read" people, so chance had nothing to do with it. No matter how deep a hole he dug himself, he'd give you the whole speech. And you'd better not point out the obvious. (he shrugs) His creditors would catch up to him. Loan sharks or whatever. He'd wake us in the middle of the night. Off we'd go, again. 
GARY What would you tell the kids? At your new school? You had to come up with a good story, right? 
Milo thinks: he's testing me. 
MILO No. I just went deeper into the machine. Preferred being the geek to having to explain. Lying would've been worse. 
GARY ...Worse? 
MILO Cause he was a liar. And I hated him. (mimicking a voice) "Get your head out of that machine, wise up to the real world." The more he mocked me the deeper I went. Cause if being savvy meant being like him -- (he shrugs) Guess that's why I'm kind of clueless, even now. Didn't cultivate my conniving side. 'Not sure I even have one. 
GARY Don't be so hard on yourself. With a brain like yours, you could connive with the best of 'em I bet. 
Gary smiles. There's no way to read it. 
EXT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - NIGHT 
Establish the humble building, in a Park. 
INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT 
Lisa and Milo sit together in front of a monitor. A Kid does his homework on a computer at the next table. Milo shakes his head, as he scrolls. 
MILO He's buying up pretty much everything: cable companies, baby bells, picture libraries, museum rights, film archives... Getting ready for Skywire. 
LISA (she's thinking) What about "60 Minutes." 
MILO Yeah, they dig stuff like this. (he types, then reads) "CBS News has partnered with Outpost Information Systems in a cable news network due to launch Fall of 2001." 
LISA But still, you can't say CBS wouldn't love to break something like -- 
MILO (he's shaking his head) Say there's just one "mole" working there, like Barton at the DOJ. How do we know he's not the guy we've contacted? Or she? Or the guy she works for? 
At the next table, she notices a Lady reading Time. 
LISA Time? 
MILO (types, reads) Time-Warner has a 40 per cent stake in Gary's set-top device. That also takes out CNN. (scrolling & scrolling) "GE joins Outpost in new venture," which means NBC is out. "Disney joins Outpost," ABC is out. "Outpost and Newscorp in new deal," Fox is out. Any of these places could have a mole. Or all of 'em. (still scrolling) It's like a a continuous loop. We can go to some alternative press place that 1,000 people read, get them and us killed. But anything big enough for this is a parent of or a subsidiary to something Gary's got a finger in! 
HOMEWORK KID Shhh. 
MILO Sorry. 
LISA Milo? 
She's thought of something. He's watching the nerdy Kid, smiling sadly, perhaps identifying with him. 
LISA How close are you? 
MILO What? 
LISA He's got 12 satellites up. He's got dishes on top of 21. He's building this -- (gestures at the screen) mega-network for Skywire. Let's use it. 
Move in on Milo as he thinks it over with a mixture of excitement and skepticism. 
EXT. LIBRARY/PARK - NIGHT 
Milo and Lisa walk in the park outside the library, thinking it through. 
MILO We can't just assume they're standing by to receive Skywire 12 months from launch. I'd have to write in an aglet. 
LISA A what? 
MILO It's how on-line services push logos they wanna sell you. You don't ask for 'em, they just appear. 'Have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house. And then the quality of the broadcast wouldn't exactly be digital, that's 12 months away. 
LISA But they'd still get the idea, right? 
MILO You'd have to design a graphic interface to make the data pop. Maybe some audio, too. To tie it all in to Gary. How long would that take you? 
LISA It's a standard GUI. Once I've got a concept, it's maybe three day's work. 
MILO Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast. 
LISA Before they kill somebody else, too. 
MILO (a new wrinkle) Oh, man. I'd have to get into Gary's house. To get the satellite positions. 
LISA You mean -- break in? 
MILO I don't know -- 
LISA And what if the broadcast dishes on top of 21 aren't hot yet? You said the place isn't finished. 
The complications pile up. They walk. They think. 
LISA I'll go look. (when he looks dubious) They'll just have a few more pictures of me snooping around. 
They come to a fountain and balustrade at the edge of the park, stop walking. 
EXT. BUILDING 21 - DAY 
Close on a satellite dish. We pan from the base of the dish to the wiring: a cable is fused to a component box. 
Lisa is on the scaffolding, having climbed it brazenly, in broad daylight. She holds a small metal box with a meter and two clamps. She applies the clamps to the base of the cable. The needle on the meter dances. 
GUARD Hey! Get down here! 
She was expecting to be busted. Still, she's scared. 
EXT. SAINT CATHERINE'S DAY SCHOOL - DAY 
A Catholic school on a wooded lane. Schoolgirls in uniform play on the swings and hopscotch courts. 
INT. LIBRARY - SAINT CATHERINE'S 
Milo types madly on a four-year-old PC. It takes him a moment to notice SISTER BEATRICE. 
MILO This is a lifesaver. My PC crashed just before finals. 
SISTER BEATRICE None of us knows how to use it. I'm thinking of taking a course. (she wants to look) May I? 
MILO Sure. 
With her, we see the complex lines of code. 
SISTER BEATRICE Forget it. 
INT. PHYSICAL SECURITY OFFICE - DAY 
Lisa sits with Bob Shrot. She's unfolding a page of sketch paper. 
LISA I needed t'see it up close for a graphic. The outpost with a dish on top? I climbed up there to get it right. 
She hands him an unfinished rendering of the dish. He looks at her, at the drawing, at her again. She's scared, but tries to hide it. 
SHROT (hands back the drawing) Next time you ask. 
Relieved, she gets up. The meter tumbles to the floor, thud. She goes white. But when she looks up, she sees 
Shrot didn't see it: Len is standing in the inner door, waving a printout. 
LEN 'Might of found something. 
Lisa grabs up the meter as Shrot joins Len. As she goes out, she hears: 
LEN Delbert seems to enter #21 twice. Without leaving the first time. 
SHROT Let's get him in here. 
INT. SEATTLE MONORAIL CAR - NIGHT 
Milo looks up as his train comes into a station. Lisa enters the car, carrying a stack of comix. He stands, they kiss, he takes the comix. 
MILO Great. I knocked off the aglet, as soon as I get a passable version of Skywire we're there. 
LISA The dishes are juiced up, too. 
MILO Thank God. 
LISA Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke into #21. I was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts. 
MILO (confused) They know I broke in. Alice helped me. (figuring it out) Shrot's not one of them. He's blundering into this on his own. 
LISA He doesn't know about the Day Care. 
MILO Hardly anybody does, that's the beauty part. No cameras, the DOJ doesn't bother with it, it's accessed by a tunnel they boast about. You know the best place to hide a leaf? 
LISA Yeah, that's old, in a tree. 
MILO Oh. 
LISA Milo? What if Shrot notices somebody entered the Day Care at four A.M.? And tells them about it? 
They look at each other: the consequences of this discovery would be deadly. 
INT. BUILDING 20 CAFETERIA - DAY 
A busy lunch hour. Milo is eating with some other Programmers, including Desi. There's a stir of excitement in the room. 
Gary comes straight to Milo's table; all conversation instantly drops out. 
GARY Milo? 
Milo stands. Gary hands him a heavy vellum invitation. 
GARY I'm giving a benefit for the art museum Thursday night. Thought you'd like to bring Alice. 
Everybody at the table is listening. 
MILO That's great! Thanks. 
GARY (as he goes) 'Sorry about the late notice... 
ANGLE: Milo, Alice, Gary, Barry Linder, Clarissa, Ricky. Milo looks utterly preoccupied... 
LINDER The merchandising implications are epic. A kid's watching the movie, he points and clicks at the laser blaster -- before the reel's even over he's ordered the toy. 
ALICE But, I mean -- Devil's Advocate -- won't that influence the content? Won't the artists complain? The directors or writers or whoever? 
LINDER Artists? Darling, the only art left in America is business. You're in Picasso's house! 
Gary smiles as everyone toasts him, except Milo; he hasn't heard any of it. 
MILO Where's the bathroom? 
LINDER The irreverence! 
Laughter. 
TRACK MILO as he wends his way through laughing, chatting Guests, dread and determination on his face. He moves away from us, enters the 
ENTRANCE HALL 
speaks to the Houseman who guards the residential rooms. 
HOUSEMAN You'll have to use one over there. 
He indicates an area on Milo's side of the door. 
MILO There's like eight women waiting in line. They take forever. (winces: painful bladder) Please? 
HOUSEMAN Right here. 
He points to a door immediately behind him. As the Houseman watches, Milo goes into the 
BATHROOM 
He stands there a moment, breathes deeply. He cracks open the door. The Houseman is turning away another Guest; Milo makes his move. 
DEN-LIKE ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Looking over his shoulder, Milo hurries to a door at the far end of the room, silently cursing the Mondrian that inevitably appears. 
The Houseman looks over his shoulder, sees the closed bathroom door, assumes Milo's still inside. 
INT. PARTY ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Gary chats with his guests. Alice looks up at the digital art, now a Bosch again. 
INT. GARY'S HOUSE - VARIOUS ROOMS - CONTINUOUS 
Milo walks fast. As he passes from one room to next, he sees a Mondrian: he's been in this room. All the austere, tastefully decorated rooms are blending together. 
He stands in the center of the room making quarter turns. Through each of four (open) doorways he sees a perfectly- appointed "den," the ultimate expression of bland, rich, professionally-decorated taste. 
He's lost. 
He starts into one room -- backs up -- goes into another. 
INT. ENTRANCE HALL - CONTINUOUS 
The Houseman looks over his shoulder again. He sees the Mondrian and, in the room beyond that, another Mondrian. 
He moves to the bathroom door, knocks on it. Opens it. He pulls a sleek walkie-talkie from his jacket. 
INT. ANOTHER DEN - CONTINUOUS 
Milo, still lost, is getting frantic. He doubles back, cuts toward another wing of the house. Through an open doorway he sees: 
A young, chillingly calm NANNY, watching him. The Baby fusses in her arms. Milo smiles, keeps moving. 
INT. GARY'S HOUSE - A DEN - CONTINUOUS 
A Second Houseman follows the trail of Mondrians. He sees Mondrians in two different directions. He hesitates, picks a direction, keeps moving. 
INT. PARTY ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
The first Houseman moves through the Guests, toward Gary. 
INT. GARY'S WORKROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Milo has finally made it. Sitting at Gary's work station, he slips a CD-ROM into the PC. It floods with text. The music echoes from far off. The entire wall behind him is filled with a Mondrian. 
INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
As Linder chats, the first Houseman sidles up to Gary, whispers in his ear. We see Gary smile, excuse himself. He and Alice share a look as he moves off. 
We go with Gary. His smiles fades instantly. He pushes through Guests, who thank him for hosting such a brilliant "do;" he hardly hears them. 
INT. GARY'S WORKROOM - NIGHT 
Milo writes frantically on his tiny pad, copying from the PC screen: 
LONGITUDE - 77 Degrees 03 Minutes 58 Seconds East 
LATITUDE - 38 Degrees 55 Minutes 14 Seconds South 
He'd better have his story straight with Gary and Alice. 
MILO No. No. I sent an E-mail to somebody, just now. To tell her how I feel about you. (looks at her) You know I'm clueless, without you. You know I -- 
ALICE (fighting tears) Just shut up? 
Or is she faking it? Has he lost the trust of all of them? He's afraid, now. 
EXT. INT. DAY CARE - DAY 
Move in on the building, past Kids playing in the yard. 
INT. DAY CARE - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY 
We hear the children's shouts OS. Short, with a fingerprint kit, is dusting the keyboards. Len stands over him. 
LEN Get the backslash, the colon, keys kids don't use but geeks do. (looking around, perplexed) What would Milo want in here, anyway? 
SHROT They know. 'Just they don't trust me with it. So we'll get the evidence, first, ask questions later. 
EXT. LIBRARY PARK - EVENING 
By the balustrade, in the dimness, Milo stands with Lisa. 
LISA Does he know you know? 
MILO He suspects I know something. I think he was sort of -- explaining himself to me, in case I do. (he breathes) We have to go in tonight. I'm two hours from a Beta version. (knows she won't like it) But I've gotta go home for an hour. 
LISA Why?! 
MILO She called to apologize. I said I was pulling an all-nighter. She said then come home just to say Hi. Which I always do when we fight, it's suspicious if I don't. 
LISA Please don't go. 
MILO At this point the worst thing I could do is anything out of the ordinary. 
She looks at him, worried, then takes a disk out of her backpack. 
LISA Here's the interface. 
He takes it. They kiss. She watches him go, worried. 
EXT./INT. MILO'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
As Milo comes up the path, he sees Alice in the kitchen. 
He opens the front door, steps in. She comes from the kitchen in an apron, wiping her hands. The apron is spattered, her hair is askew. 
ALICE I'm a mess! I got this Hunan cookbook, since we're always afraid for you to eat in Chinese restaurants. I've been mincing things into teeny-tiny pieces all afternoon. 
He smiles to hide his terror. Is she killing him now? Or just testing his reaction? Or is it a sincere overture? 
MILO Great! 
ALICE Look at me! I'm gonna change. 
When she turns away, we see the fear on his face. 
INT. THE BEDROOM - A MOMENT LATER 
Alice pulls into a dress. 
IN THE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 
Milo, at the stove, sniffs at the food that simmers in a wok. He grabs a a spoon, examines it; but it's minced too fine to discern one ingredient from another. 
BEDROOM 
Alice pulls her hair back with a ribbon... 
KITCHEN 
Milo churns the garbage in the wastebasket, reads the label on a jar, the label on a can... 
BEDROOM 
Alice applies blush-on. 
KITCHEN 
Milo goes through the spice cabinet... 
LIVING ROOM - A MOMENT LATER 
Milo paces. He stops when she comes from the bedroom. 
MILO (he smiles) You look beautiful. 
ALICE Yeah? Give me a goodbye kiss. 
MILO ...What? 
ALICE I know you. You're gonna run back to work right after dinner. I want my kiss now. 
LISA (ON THE PHONE) It's three years old, it -- 
INT. MILO'S CAR - CONTINUOUS 
MILO (ON THE PHONE) Bring it to the other location. 
LISA But you said the other -- 
He rings off. He reads something off a business card. 
INT. LISA'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
Scrambling, Lisa grabs her old laptop, finds her keys. 
INT. GARY'S HOUSE - GARY'S WORKROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Phil's on the phone. 
PHIL Yeah, alright. (hangs up, briefs Gary) He's off campus, he's taken some surveillance data with him. 
Gary's eyes narrow. 
PHIL She's bringing her laptop, it's wired. Second she boots up, we're on 'em. 
EXT./INT. BUILDING/MILO'S CAR - RURAL ROAD - NIGHT 
Milo reads the address off the business card, which has a satellite dish as its logo. (He holds it in front of him.) 
When he brings down the card, it reveals a real-life satellite dish through the windshield. 
As the car pulls up by a low cinderblock building, we read a sign that says KNQR - PUBLIC ACCESS. 
INT. KNQR - RECEPTION AREA - CONTINUOUS 
Milo rushes in, lugging the tower. There's a linoleum floor, framed one-sheets for tacky public access shows (Yoga, blow- dried Evangelist, Nude Talk Show). Behind the reception desk sits a beefy RENT-A-GUARD with an earring. 
RENT-A-GUARD Help you? 
MILO Brian here? Brian Bissel? 
RENT-A-GUARD (picks up the phone) Who wants to see him? 
INT./EXT. LISA'S CAR/HIGHWAY - NIGHT 
Lisa drives fast, checking her rear-view-mirror to make sure she's not being followed. Pan to the seat next to her: her laptop lies on the passenger seat. 
INT. DAY CARE COMPUTER ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
A monitor shows a green interface with yellow coordinates (like an air traffic controllers' screen). Randy sits at the keyboard in front of it, phone cradled on shoulder. 
RANDY (into the phone) Nothing. They haven't booted-up yet. 
INT. KNQR - CONTINUOUS 
Milo speaks to Brian. 
MILO This is the biggest Beta demo in like the history of software. You'd be my partner. 
BRIAN You can't pre-empt Yoga, that's our biggest show. 
MILO Brian! You wanna be a big deal, don't you? That's your dream in life. 
Brian is examining the data tower. He touches the Outpost logo branded into it, rather reverently. 
Lisa comes in, laptop slung over her arm. 
BRIAN Will I get to work for Outpost? 
MILO No. But you can write your own ticket in the Valley after this. We're gonna bring down Outpost. 
BRIAN What? 
MILO What'd they ever do for you? 
Brian's thinking it over. He shrugs. 
BRIAN Okay. 
MILO Great. Great! We need to drag a lot of heavy stuff in front of the door -- 
BRIAN What?! 
MILO (to the Rent-a-Guard) Wanna be a part of history? 
RENT-A-GUARD Not really. 
MILO (digging in his pocket) Well -- would you like to pick up an extra -- 232 dollars? 
INT. GARY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
Gary is pacing... 
PHIL (on the phone) Nothing yet, Gary... 
PHIL Longitude 48 degrees 06 minutes -- 
EXT. KNQR - CONTINUOUS 
Gunther and Riman squeal into the station parking lot. 
INT. SATELLITE ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Lisa looks out the window to the parking lot, below. Milo is typing in coordinates. 
LISA They're already here. My laptop must be wired! 
BRIAN (anxiously) Milo? 
MILO (typing) We're there. 
Milo hits enter. 
INT. GARY'S WORKROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Gary hits enter. 
EXT. SPACE CONTINUOUS 
A second Skywire satellite shifts regally away from the Earth, as if shunning the signal. 
INT. SATELLITE ROOM KNQR - CONTINUOUS 
Milo, Lisa, Brian watch the TV's. "ER" et al. 
MILO Damn! 
EXT./INT. KNQR - ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS 
Gunther and Riman tear through the barricade the Rent-A-Cop has erected with ruthless precision. 
INT. SATELLITE ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Milo cogitates while Lisa reviews the satellite coordinates -- 
LISA (to Brian) You checked your connections? 
BRIAN (to Milo) Yes! Should you reboot? 
Milo is scrolling the software, trying to figure out which of a 1,000 possible glitches is getting in the way. 
MILO ...He knows. 
LISA What? 
MILO He's been altering the coordinates since we logged on. He's a step ahead. Let's jump to #12. 
INT. GARY'S WORKROOM - CONTINUOUS 
PHIL Ready for number three? 
GARY Let's go. 
PHIL Longitude 109 -- 
GARY Wait... He knows. 
PHIL What? 
GARY 'Knows I'm altering the coordinates. Let's jump to #12. 
PHIL Gary? 
GARY Just do it. 
INT. KNQR - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 
The Rent-A-Guard drags furniture, props, lights, in front of the entrance to the satellite room. 
INT. ENTRANCE - KNQR - CONTINUOUS 
Gunther and Riman have created an opening in the barricade. They step through it. They hear the racket the Rent-a-Guard is making upstairs. They head that way. 
INT. STAIRWAY/UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 
The Rent-A-Guard is holding a lightstand as they ascend, guns drawn. 
GUNTHER Step aside. We won't hurt you. 
Riman takes the lightstand from him. The Rent-a-Guard puts his hands up, sidles across the hallway as they tear into the barricade. 
INT. SATELLITE ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Lisa reads to Milo. 
LISA Latitude 47 degrees. 
MILO Wait a second. He knows I know. 
We hear sirens grow near. Gunther watches the broadcast, still gripping his gun. 
RIMAN (to Gunther) You know the scenario for this. 
This sounds ominous. Lisa wonders what it means. Milo wonders what it means. He swallows hard. 
MILO 'Last thing you wanna do is hurt us now. (not at all sure) Right? 
GUNTHER (to Brian) Who's seeing this? 
BRIAN (with dread) Who isn't? 
CUT TO: 
A MONTAGE 
1. MOVE PAST ROWS & ROWS OF PC's playing surveillance footage, a crash-scene upload, and an obituary, in a college computer lab. Students watch, agog. 
GARY'S VOICE OVER We work hard to stay ahead because we know any kid working in his garage can put us out of business. 
2. TIMES SQUARE - Pedestrians and motorists (with craned necks) watch the Jumbo-Tron, now the world's biggest desktop. In one window, college video of a promising Programmer, in the other, footage of a cult suicide. (Sometimes the Programmer in question is simultaneous with his obit, sometimes not, but the connection by now becomes clear). 
GARY'S VOICE OVER The first rule of the software business is: those who don't innovate are doomed to die. 
3. The cuts accelerate. In a NETWORK CONTROL ROOM, Technicians flip switches, trying to bring back scheduled programming. At the NIKKEI, the Brokers are transfixed by what comes over the Big Board. In a VEGAS CASINO Gamblers sip their drinks as they watch it on closed-circuit horserace monitors. On a STREET CORNER, a Crack Dealer watches on his beeper. At a STADIUM, the Stones play but (tilting up) the Diamond Vision behind them plays Milo's broadcast. In an ELECTRONICS STORE, a wall of TV's -- 200 of them -- plays grisly primer footage for Shoppers. A guy takes a shiny wrapped copy of Outpost '98 from his basket, returns it to the shelf... In the Day Care Computer Room, it plays on all the monitors as Randy moves through the room with a big buzzing electro-magnetic hoop, which he runs over each tower, wiping out data. 
Through all the cuts, we hear Gary's narration: 
GARY'S VOICE OVER That's why we work so hard to invent or acquire great new applications. Consumers don't care where new ideas come from, just so long as they're offered at competitive prices. Isn't that what the free market's about? Sure, we like being #1, but it's pressure, too. This business is binary: you're a zero or a one. 
INT. JUSTICE DEPT. - WASHINGTON D.C. - CONTINUOUS 
A group of Government Lawyers, working late (Chinese takeout, loosened ties) watch with a dawning sense of unbelievable good luck. 
JUSTICE DEPT. LAWYER 'Guess we should wake the Attorney General. 
TIGHT ON: A PC SCREEN - Teddy Chin's recruitment file is in one window, the hate crime footage is in another. 
GARY'S VOICE OVER I've been called "aggressive" but to me, that's really a compliment. 
REVERSE: SUNNYVALE LOFT - CONTINUOUS 
Larry watches with his start-up partners. His eyes close: it hurts to see Teddy, again. 
GARY'S VOICE OVER Look at all the jobs and technologies my "aggression" has created. 
INT. LYLE BARTON'S HOUSE - FRONT ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
OPEN on a framed photo of Barton, his Wife and Kids. The broadcast plays, OS. 
BARTON'S WIFE (O.S.) Lyle? Phone for you. 
She comes in. No Barton. The front door is wide open, the TV is still on. 
GARY'S VOICE OVER We really are a family here at Outpost. 
INT. MILO & LISA'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Paintings are gone from the wall, clothes flung around. Move in on a note pinned to the pillow, as the TV plays. 
GARY'S VOICE OVER I think that's why outsiders sometimes sees us as "cultish" or "secretive." 
Milo, It wasn't so bad, really. 
XX "Alice" 
EXT. OUTPOST CAMPUS - NIGHT 
High wide shot: sirens scream as unmarked sedans and squadcars squeal into the sanctified parking lot. 
GARY'S VOICE OVER Is loyalty and group spirit somehow "sinister" nowadays? 
INT. GARY'S WORKROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Open on Gary's TV monitors, then pan into the room. Phil has departed; the Outpost Lawyers have taken his place. 
LAWYER The "murder" stuff is all innuendo: bad PR, legally null. 'Could probably be spun as Urban Legend. There is a case for corporate espionage, but if you cop a plea, you'll get a slap -- 
GARY Cop a plea? I'm confused, Ted. You think I knew about this? 
The Lawyers suppress their opinion. 
GARY I'm running the company, fighting the DOJ, raising a family. Randy and Phil obviously overreacted. To this endless, antitrust witchhunt. 
LAWYER (get real) The government's gonna offer 'em a helluva deal to tie you into this. Whether you knew about it or not. 
LAWYER 2 Randy, Phil and whoever else knew about it. 
GARY That won't be a problem. 
INT./EXT. CAR/RURAL ROAD - CONTINUOUS 
Gunther & Riman turn off a rural road...

THE SECRET LIFE OF WALTER MITTY 
Written by 
Steve Conrad 
"Too much happens... Man performs, engenders so much more than he can or should have to bear. That's how he finds that he can bear anything." 
- William Faulkner 
INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, BROOKLYN - MORNING 
Walter Mitty (30s) sits at his small kitchen table, balancing his check book. We see his last several expense entries: 
Mom's new apt. deposit 
EHARMONY SIGN-UP 
O's braces (2nd installment) 
PIANO MOVERS 
PIANO STORAGE 
Piano delivery to Mom's new apt. 
In-piano humidity control system 
EXT. CORNER 5TH AVENUE, 43RD STREET, NYC - DAY 
During the morning rush hour, a crowd of businessmen waits on the corner to cross the street. Walter is among them, dressed in a short-sleeve business shirt and tie and with a briefcase on hand. Nothing happens. Then Walter's head explodes. 
CREDITS BEGIN 
Up toward the clouds, propelled skyward, were the contents (ideas and images) of Walter's head; they've begun to float toward the ground. 
INT. SKYSCRAPER, NYC - SAME 
Some office work is going on. Then past the window (outside) comes floating down, in slow motion, Juan Valdez the Colombian Coffee guy (his donkey's floating down way in the distance). 
This happens outside other high-rise and professional building windows - a floating Bishop Desmond Tutu, the silver Monopoly piece Top Hat, Statler and Waldorf (the two elderly curmudgeons from The Muppet Show) and additional detritus from Walter's mind such as Manute Bol, The Beastie Boys, etc. CREDITS PLAY. 
INT. STARBUCKS, MIDTOWN NYC - MOMENTS LATER 
Walter sits at a Midtown Starbucks. He's got his laptop out and he's in the middle of a phone call. 
EHARMONY COUNSELOR You know, you didn't really provide much detail about your occupation. Most people put theirs on their eHarmony page. You don't care to? 
WALTER Is that like a must? Can't I just say like "I'm employed" or something? 
EHARMONY COUNSELOR (like okay but that's not a great idea) Sure. 
WALTER My work's not really that interesting. To women. Um. Or men. 
EHARMONY COUNSELOR What do you do? 
WALTER I'm a Practical Asset Manager. For a corporation. 
EHARMONY COUNSELOR (sounds like he agrees it's not interesting) ....okay. What do you do when you're not working? 
WALTER Mostly I guess I commute to work? It's like an hour and-- 
EHARMONY COUNSELOR Okay. No worries. I'll submit this information, then check back in the afternoon for your possible eHarmony matchups. That's exciting, huh? 
WALTER It is, Todd. Yeah. Hey, when can I leave a "wink" for someone? To see if they "wink" back, or..? 
Walter's looking at his laptop. On screen is the eHarmony dating page for CHERYL M. (34), pretty but she looks like the sort of pretty girl who takes the bus; text beside her photo reads "Leave a wink for Cheryl M. to indicate your interest..." 
EHARMONY COUNSELOR I'll have your eHarmony profile all uploaded in a minute. 
WALTER Cool. 
EHARMONY COUNSELOR So like in two minutes. But hey, you're a little light, if you don't mind me saying this, in your "Been There, Done that" column. 
Part of the eHarmony client profile has a section Been There, Done That - where people list their accomplishments, travels, etc. 
WALTER I forgot what I put there? 
EHARMONY COUNSELOR ...Nothing. 
WALTER Oh, okay. 
GARY MANNHEIM (AWKWARD) Gary Mannheim. Um. Vice President of Acquisitions. Too. So what are you going to be doing at the company, Ted? 
TED HENDRICKS Managing the acquisition. Identifying overlap. Reducing staff where we find redundancy. What's your focus been here, Gary? 
GARY MANNHEIM ...I've been managing acquisitions. Identifying overlap. Then reducing staff where I find redundancy. 
Further awkward moments pass. 
TED HENDRICKS Wow, okay. That's not... 
GARY MANNHEIM Yeah, that's not good. 
TED HENDRICKS No. (TO WALTER) What do you do? 
WALTER I'm a Practical Asset Manager. 
TED HENDRICKS Do you play an important role here? 
WALTER I do. Yeah. Totally. I work in a one-on-one basis (on a one-on-one basis I mean) with all our photographers. 
Ted just looks at him for a moment. 
TED HENDRICKS I'm sorry. I was really getting into this song. What were you saying? 
Walter listens to the elevator muzak Ted just referred to. It's like Maneater in muzak; no one could get into it. 
WALTER I was just saying I manage our film negatives from the moment they arri- 
TED HENDRICKS (starting to leave) Let's talk later. We have a specific time set aside to conference with employees of the former company. 
WALTER What time is that? 
TED HENDRICKS I'm not sure. But it's not at this time. 
WALTER Okay. 
TED HENDRICKS I have to see the board and start evaluations now. 
WALTER Okay. Thank you. (flustered, feeling that was a dumb thing to say) I mean "not thank you." I mean like "looking forward to it" I should have said. 
Ted just looks over. The door's closing. 
WALTER (CONT'D) (through the closing DOORS) Looking forward to it. 
The doors are almost closed. 
TED HENDRICKS I'll come by sometime this week. 
WALTER Awesome. 
GARY MANNHEIM Are you going to come by my...um? 
The doors close. Ted's not coming by Gary's office. 
INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 
Walter walks up a long hallway toward his department floor; on the walls are hugely blown up Life Magazine photographs. Twelve foot high Muhammad Ali, Morgan Freeman (Oscar pose), Moon Landings. - Walter looks small compared. The last photo he passes is familiar - a black and white of a New Orleans Jazz Funeral. 
INT. WALTER'S DIVISION FLOOR, LIFE - LATER 
The division Walter works in has fifty employees seated around an open floor plan - fifty cubicles in view. Walter's arrived at his to find on his desk a wrapped gift with a note READING: 
Heard rumbling's Life's over. Wanted to give you something cool if this is the last photo batch. Hope when you open it and look inside you'll think it's pretty special. 
Walter's unwrapped the gift. 
It's a leather wallet. Its front is embossed with the inscription from S.O. to Walter Mitty - thanks for the great work. 
Walter looks back at the letter; it finishes - by the way, neg 12 is my best ever. Landmark. The Absolute Quintessence of Life. .... the rest of the batch kind of sucks. Sean 
INT. RECEIVING ROOM, LIFE MAGAZINE - LATER 
Walter has been working through a Life photo order negative box - it's marked Sean O'Connell. There's a co-worker (HERNANDO) cleaning up in the distance. Walter has been examining a negative roll with his loupes (magnifiers worn as eye glasses). THEN HE NOTICES SOMETHING THAT STOPS HIM. The negative roll, where the 12th negative should be, has been cut; 12 is missing. 
WALTER Hey, Hernando- 
HERNANDO Yeah? 
WALTER This 12th neg? From this last Life roll? 
HERNANDO Yeah. 
Cheryl Mellhoff sits down beside Walter. 
WALTER (CONT'D) What is this? 
He hands her the foggy print - it's clear they have an established working friendship. 
WALTER (CONT'D) I think it's either a man with one sideburn. Or a candelabra. Or a Happy Days lunch box. 
CHERYL (can't make it out clearly EITHER) It's... is it two badminton racquets? What's it supposed to be? 
WALTER It's the Quintessence of Life. So I don't think it's two badminton racquets. Sean O'Connell took this just before he took another one we lost. 
CHERYL (like that's significant) You lost a Sean O'Connell? 
WALTER (looking at the out of FOCUS PRINT) ...I'm trying to figure out what this picture is. I think he focused, set his lens then took the missing picture. It's just a better picture of this. What is this? 
CHERYL Maybe Sean has it. 
WALTER The negative? Yeah, I tried to reach him. He's always in Bahrain. Or a shanty town or somewhere - I got one email off. 
Walter shows Cheryl an email exchange from Sean O'Connell - 
It reads - in need of info for neg 12 of neg roll three, box 
Sean's reply - Best picture I've taken. The total F'ing Quintessence of Life. I hope you're as happy with it as I am. 
Walter's reply = Cool, but can't find it. 
Sean's reply - Out of Office. This is an auto reply. Sean O'Connell will be out of the office through the month of November. 
WALTER (CONT'D) No cell phone. He's out on a freelance. I'd really like to find him. 
Walter has taken further photographs from his briefcase 
WALTER (CONT'D) These are pictures from the last roll he sent in. I'm trying to draw a bead on his location by analyzing these. 
CHERYL Have you figured anything out? 
WALTER Not yet. Because my trail is... water. 
Walter starts showing Cheryl the photographs. The first of which is water - just a picture of water, could be an ocean, lake, or pool (puddle). 
WALTER (CONT'D) A Starbucks, which I don't know which one. (flipping to the next one) And a man (or woman's) thumb. 
This is a picture of a thumb. 
WALTER (CONT'D) I've been trying to figure out the gender (of the thumb), as I sat here. How many people in the world? 
CHERYL Six billion. 
WALTER Everyone's got two, too. 
CHERYL Two, too, what? 
WALTER Thumbs. 
CHERYL Yeah. But I think there are more Starbucks, so I don't know if that's what you'd call a hot trail-- 
WALTER Look what Sean gave me. 
Walter has taken the gift wallet out - S.O. to Walter Mitty - thanks for the great work. 
WALTER (CONT'D) Because we covered, you know, so many hotspots together the last 9 years... (a little more quietly) ...boldly 
CHERYL (having some fun with WALTER) You guys covered the hotspots together boldly? 
WALTER As a team. Yeah. By Sean actually going to the hotspots, and by me staying here waiting for the pictures of hotspots to come back so I can boldly transfer them to magazine format. 
Cheryl's laughed. 
CHERYL ...What did you do this weekend? 
WALTER We're moving my mom here. I went and packed her house up. What about you? 
CHERYL My son and I went on a bike ride in Lake Valhalla. Jersey. We brought lunch. Had lunch in an actual field, of grass. We went swimming. My friend Marny lives on the lake. (getting to what's on everyone's minds around THERE) ...This is going to be the last issue. Life's going to be strictly online after this merger. No new photographs. We're just going to be an internet photo storehouse. That's what I'm hearing. They're going to let most of us go. 
Walter sits there for awhile. That's tough news. He's got a lot on his mind. Then he gets a text: From Odessa, it reads: 
- piano a-holes want 300 more dollars to take the piano back, come down. I have to go. Like right now. 
INT. LOBBY, TIME-LIFE BUILDING - SAME 
Walter gets a text from Odessa that says I'm leaving. 
WALTER Hey, Todd. I have to go. I have a piano situation I have to take care of. 
EHARMONY COUNSELOR Okay, man. 
WALTER Um hey, can I have my four hundred dollars back? 
EXT. BATTERY PARK, NYC - LATER 
Walter walks up to Battery Park to find (really) a grand piano sitting in the park. He stops and stares at it awhile. 
EXT. BATTERY PARK, NYC - LATER 
Walter sits at the abandoned piano (in pristine shape). Regular NY foot traffic passes around him. He absentmindedly starts playing the first bars of Cheers. Then he just keeps doing it because he's thinking of other things. 
GUY IN PARK Stop playing Cheers, Dick. 
Then Walter sees Cheryl Mellhoff and her son RICH (9), headed his way from across Bridge Street. They've got two skateboards. Walter smiles when he sees them and waves. 
EXT. BRIDGE STREET - LATER 
Cheryl, Walter and Rich push the grand piano toward quiet Bridge Street. It's on its wheels and a couple skateboards. It's rolling down the street pretty well. They're about to push it out onto the street. 
WALTER Rich, are you ready to push a piano down a street and get honked at by everybody in New York? 
RICH (like it's going to be FUN) Yeah. 
They do. The honking begins right away, but they keep rolling the grand piano down Bridge Street. It looks like it might be fun. 
CHERYL I can't believe they left it in the park. How old is this? 
WALTER Her dad bought it for her when she was six. It's seventy-years-old. 
CHERYL Your sister just took off? 
WALTER My sister's not the responsible one in the family. 
CHERYL No kidding, man. 
WALTER She told them no steps. I paid them for a first floor move. But she screwed up and got my mom a apartment on the 15th floor. The movers weren't equipped to get it up there. She didn't have the money for them to take it back. She had to get her braces adjusted, so she just took off. 
CHERYL Braces. How old is she? 
WALTER 
EXT. BRIDGE STREET - LATER 
It's pretty late now. Walter has placed a tarp over the piano. They rolled it into a city parking space. 
CHERYL You're sure this is your sister's parking space? 
WALTER Yeah. Hey, Rich. You're pretty good on that. 
Rich is skateboarding around a little. 
WALTER (CONT'D) I used to skateboard a little. 
CHERYL (something about the idea makes her smile) When? 
WALTER Maine. When I was a kid. (trying to unburden her of the other skateboard) Hey. I'll bring it in tomorrow. I don't want you to have to carry it all the way home. I got it. 
CHERYL Thanks. 
WALTER You helped me move a piano. I can carry this. See you Rich. Thanks for putting your back into it. 
RICH What does that mean? 
WALTER Just, you know... helping out, man. 
CHERYL See you tomorrow. 
WALTER Yeah. 
Walter's got the piano all tarped. Cheryl and Rich take off. 
WALTER (CONT'D) Are you sure I can't walk you home? 
CHERYL I'm going to drop Rich at his Dad's. Thanks, Walter. 
Walter hangs out a moment. He's watching them go. Then he starts walking off with Rich's skateboard. 
INT. LOBBY, TIME-LIFE BUILDING - LATER 
The French mob jogs through the lobby with Walter atop their shoulders. 
FRENCHMEN (European sports chant) Wal-ter Mi-tty. 
INT. ELEVATOR, MOVING - MOMENTS LATER 
Among more serious-looking businessmen and woman, the raucous tour-de-France style congratulations party continues. Walter's just being mobbed by ecstatic Frenchmen. 
INT. FORTIETH FLOOR, ELEVATOR LOBBY - LATER 
No one's around. We hear the quiet "ding" of the elevator arriving. Then Walter gets out. There are no crowds anywhere - just Walter in his short-sleeve dress shirt, tie and briefcase. He reaches his division floor offices door and enters his pass-key. Then his mom walks up - EDNA MITTY, 76. 
EDNA Hi, honey. 
WALTER (noticing her, surprised) Hey, Mom. 
EDNA Hi, Walter. Is it all right I'm dropping by? 
WALTER Sure, (meaning the open office AREA) we'll just go through here to my office. 
INT. DIVISION FLOOR - CONTINUOUS 
As Walter and Edna enter the division floor, colleague Tim Naughton walks past. 
TIM NAUGHTON (TO WALTER) They just called a conference. 
WALTER (following Tim, with his mom at his side, to her) Hey, your new place is almost ready. We just had a little hiccup due to Odessa just not getting the right one. 
EDNA Well, she's the artist... 
WALTER Why did she get the cool name? She got to turn out cool. 
EDNA I named her after a wonderful visit your Dad and I had to Odessa, our family's homeland, one summer, in southern Ukraine. There's a beautiful river there also named Odessa. 
WALTER Why did you name me Walter? 
EDNA I named you after Walter Matthau 
WALTER (noticing that a conference is starting) Okay. This is starting I think. We should probably just stop here to-- 
They've walked out onto the division floor where a group of forty or so employees has been gathered together to allow Ted Hendricks a speech (which he's forcing a colleague to make). They stand a short distance away, in the middle of letting THEM KNOW: 
TED HENDRICKS COLLEAGUE This will only take a moment. I just wanted to inform you all, reluctantly, that this month's issue will be the last. 
The employees have been expecting this. Nonetheless, the news saddens and concerns them. 
TED HENDRICKS COLLEAGUE (CONT'D) You are all valued employees. But as we undergo this transition we wanted to be candid with you that some of you will be-- 
TED HENDRICKS (correcting him, a little more quietly, just to HIM) Most. 
TED HENDRICKS COLLEAGUE (to Ted, quietly) What's that? 
TED HENDRICKS Most of them. 
TED HENDRICKS COLLEAGUE We wanted to be clear that most of you will be determined non-vital to the new partnership. The remaining few employees will carry over into the new organization. We'll be deciding which category your positions fall into over the course of the next week. 
Tim Naughton, among the gathered (soon to be former) employees, has begun a quiet, high-pitched, weeping. Walter has had to field this news while his mother stands beside him. 
TED HENDRICKS COLLEAGUE (CONT'D) Now for some good news. We're very EXCITED TO-- 
At this point, Ted Hendricks nudges the guy to move over so Ted can assume the speaking part for the good news portion. 
TED HENDRICKS Okay. So, we're very excited to play a part in publishing what will be the very last issue of Life Magazine, which has been an American Institution for 75 years and whose renowned covers have touched us all really touching ways. And for the final issue, our cover is going to be something which is... (he forgot the word, looks at the editor for help) What was that word? 
EDITOR (WHISPERING) Quintessence. 
TED HENDRICKS Our cover will probably be the most famous ever because it really has the awesome quintessence of Life. And we're all going to be a part of this historic happening. Even those of you who will, right after the happening, be asked to leave. Thank you. 
Ted begins to clap (for some reason). So the gathered employees also begin some watered-down clapping. Walter is among them, standing beside his mom, who is clapping too. Then they all stop the fake good cheer and head back to work. 
INT. STORAGE ROOM, PRACTICAL ASSETS, LIFE - LATER 
Later, Walter's mom is with him in his work area, back in the storage area of practical assets. 
WALTER (to colleague Hernando, little rattled about the quintessence cover news) Check for negative 12 in the wash bins. 
EDNA So the moving bill came, for my move down here. I wanted to bring it by. Thank you so much Walter. 
WALTER Mom, come on. It's nothing. 
WALTER (showing them another PHOTO) Have you seen this Starbucks? 
SECOND TEEN I don't know. Possibly. 
WALTER (ANOTHER PHOTO) Have you seen this man (or woman's) thumb? 
INT. COFFEE SHOP, NUUK - MORNING 
It's a fresh morning. Walter's sitting in a coffee shop, looking out on the capital town street. Then he sees a cab pull up for him. 
INT. CAB, MOVING - LATER 
Walter sits in back. The older female cabby cruises the car past some open, pretty fields. 
CAB DRIVER Greenland is the least densely populated country in the world. There's only 56,000 people. Lots to do. Most of us work a few different jobs, to cover everything. For example I drive this cab. 
A moment passes. 
CAB DRIVER (CONT'D) I'm also the Queen. 
Walter has been surprised. 
WALTER ...You're the Queen of Greenland? 
CAB DRIVER Yeah. Oh, there goes my meter. 
Her meter's gone out. 
CAB DRIVER (CONT'D) You want to just a call it 93 kroner? Flat rate. 
WALTER That's cool... your Majesty. 
An awkward moment passes. 
WALTER (CONT'D) Should I call you that? 
CAB DRIVER Sure. 
WALTER Is there anything around here that a renowned photographer might be photographing? 
CAB DRIVER No. 
WALTER Are you sure? 
CAB DRIVER Yes. 
WALTER I think he was here. 
CAB DRIVER Well, possibly if he was mistaken, he might have thought the Musk Ox migration was worth photographing. 
WALTER Can we see that? 
INT. CAB, MOVING, OUTSKIRTS, NUUK, GREENLAND - LATER 
Walter and the Queen continue their peaceful drive through the outskirts of Nuuk, Greenland. 
WALTER So are you Queen for life? 
CAB DRIVER Yeah. 
WALTER That's a good gig. They're making some changes at work. My work. They're letting most of the divisions go. 
CAB DRIVER How long have you been there? 
WALTER Nine years. 
CAB DRIVER That's tough. 
WALTER How'd you get to be Queen? 
CAB DRIVER My dad was King. 
WALTER ...My dad sold ice cream. 
CAB DRIVER Here we are. 
Walter looks out the window. In a field they've parked beside, there are a few indigenous Oxen (they look like huge Jim Henson muppets) walking slowly. 
WALTER That's the Musk Ox migration? 
CAB DRIVER Yeah. 
Walter's quietly kayaking through an empty expanse of the Atlantic. His paddle makes noise; that's it. Then Cheryl Mellhoff emerges from underwater - but she's giant. She takes up the whole horizon. She's catching her breath like she's been underwater for a while. Then her son Rich (giant) pops up from underwater beside her. He catches his breath, too, but he's pleased. 
RICH I stayed under longer. 
CHERYL Just barely. 
RICH Let's do it again. 
CHERYL Okay. One, two, three. 
Cheryl fakes going underwater on three. Rich has. She's still above water. She's cheating. She stays there for a while, smiling. Then Rich pops up. 
RICH You're cheating. 
CHERYL (LAUGHING) Okay, okay. One two three. 
They both get caught faking it this time, and they start   to laugh. Then they both go underwater. They're under for a   long time. A pretty long time, in fact. Then Cheryl surfaces.   But Rich doesn't. She's breathing again, but she expected to   see Rich and doesn't, and now she's concerned. 
CHERYL (CONT'D) Rich...? 
He's nowhere. 
CHERYL (CONT'D) Rich? 
Finally, he pops up. But he's coughing, was under too long and has taken in some water; he's scared. 
CHERYL (CONT'D) It's okay. Come here. Hey come here. 
She hugs him. 
CHERYL (CONT'D) Hey, it's okay. 
He's freaked, he's crying a little. 
CHERYL (CONT'D) Hey, don't worry. You're good. Don't worry. Hey... 
After a moment, she begins to sing to distract him. She's singing Bob Marley's Three Little Birds pretty well. 
CHERYL (CONT'D) Don't worry, about a thing, `cause every little thing, is gonna be all right. Don't worry. About a thing... 
Walter looks on from (from his kayak). He's worried about a lot of things, but what he's picturing soothes him too. The day dream fades. Walter keeps kayaking. It looks desolate, then a guy in a rubber triathlon swimsuit swims by. Then another one does. 
WALTER ....shit. 
A wide shot shows that Walter has kayaked near to the coast of Reykjavik, Iceland during the swimming portion of a triathlon. Now he's in the midst of a hundred pissed guys in rubber swim suits. 
WALTER (CONT'D) Fuck. Sorry. 
INT. ICELANDIC CAB, MOVING, REYKJAVIK ICELAND - DAY 
Walter's in the heart of Reykjavik, Iceland, driven through the city. He's taking in the sights, looking around through the cab window, when his phone rings again. He checks his caller I.D 
WALTER (CLICKING OVER) Hey, Mom. 
EDNA Hi, Walter. 
WALTER What's up? 
EDNA Oh, I'm just making some yogurt. With some banana. 
WALTER Okay. Cool. 
EDNA It snowed today. Didn't expect that. Not much. Just a light little cover. Very pretty. Less than an inch even. 
WALTER That's awesome. 
EDNA My piano got towed, Walter. 
A moment goes by. 
WALTER ...Your piano got towed? 
EDNA Yes. Odessa said it wasn't there. Where you said it was going to be. (MORE) 
EDNA (CONT'D) She said possibly that it got towed. That that's not her space anymore. 
WALTER I lent her money for that space. 
EDNA Where are you, honey? 
WALTER In Iceland. 
Walter walks over, lowers himself beneath the keyboard, finds a grip, then rises and lifts the piano up by himself. 
EXT. NEW JERSEY TURNPIKE - LATER 
Walter's carrying the piano on his back, walking down the middle of the New Jersey Turnpike, slowing down traffic. 
EXT. SUBWAY STATION, NY - LATER 
Walter climbs a set of stairs to the subway with the piano on his back. 
INT. SUBWAY STATION - LATER 
Walter sits on a bench waiting for the train. The Grand Piano is beside him. 
INT. SUBWAY, MOVING - LATER 
Walter has brought the piano onto the subway. Then the subway hits one of those mid-tunnel stops where the train stops, and the lights go on and off. When the lights return we see the piano's gone. Walter's still there though. 
CUT TO: 
A CHECK BOOK EXPENSE ENTRY 
Piano move (third) - $1,100.00 
INT. APARTMENT - DAY 
This is an empty (small) apartment. Walter and his sister ODESSA sit on the carpet. She's pretty, good spirit, a little flighty (also she's wearing braces). She's watching Walter write this piano moving check. But she's looking at a checkbook entry a few entries above it. 
ODESSA Does that say eHarmony? Four hundred dollars. 
WALTER Yes. 
ODESSA (a little amused) Are you on eHarmony? 
WALTER No. 
ODESSA Then why did you give them four hundred dollars? 
WALTER I tried to join, but-- I don't really even want to be on it. I'm just trying to do this thing with someone at work. 
ODESSA (meaning do what) What? 
At this point we see a piano float up into view outside the living room window beyond them, odd because they're fifteen stories up. 
WALTER I'm trying to do that Piña Colada thing? (singing pretty well) "If you like Piña Coladas, and getting caught in the rain while wearing a cape--" 
ODESSA That's not how it goes. 
WALTER Well, the guy answers a personal ad and finds out it's his wife. They have a good laugh, then they make love on the cape while drinking Piña Coladas or something, and wearing capes, I think. Anyway. I'm hoping she'll click my profile and not realize that she works in my office area. Then we can realize it and have a good laugh. Then-- 
ODESSA Make love on a cape? While wearing capes? Because that's not what they do in the song. 
WALTER No, then we can know that we picked each other out, you know, from the whole planet. Not just the cafeteria. 
Walter's quiet for a moment. 
WALTER (CONT'D) ... We're friends. I'd like there to be more. (MORE) 
WALTER (CONT'D) I was hoping this web site (that they won't let me be on) would show her more. 
Walter is putting his checkbook back in his briefcase. Odessa has noticed the out-of-focus photo Walter carries in it. 
ODESSA (about the picture) What's that? 
WALTER I don't know. What do you think it is? 
Odessa looks the photo for a while. 
ODESSA (trying to make it out) ...Triple A batteries working, as a team, to carry a fish tank up some apartment stairs. 
Out the window we see that the piano is attached to a crane. Movers have lifted it up to the fifteenth floor. Walter looks out at it from the small, small room they're in. 
WALTER We better tell them they need to shift that over to outside the big room. 
ODESSA What big room? 
WALTER (sensing there is going to be some problem) The big room where the big piano is going to go. 
ODESSA This is the big room. 
Walter's surprised. There's no way the piano fits in this space. 
Odessa has handed him two wrapped gifts. Walter begins to unwrap them. Inside are two toys: A Stretch Armstrong and, from yesteryear, the cheap drawing tablet where little metal filings are moved about with a magnetic wand to add features to a cartoon face. 
ODESSA (CONT'D) Those were your favorite toys when you were a kid. You don't remember? 
WALTER (TOUCHED) Yeah, I do.... Thanks. 
Odessa gives Walter a kiss. 
INT. SUBWAY, MOVING, NYC - LATER 
Walter's riding the subway to work. Everything looks pretty normal except there's a small African Antelope walking around. 
INT. ELEVATOR, TIME-LIFE BUILDING - LATER 
Walter gets in the elevator - but already in there are Ted Hendricks and the executive board member guys. Walter has been caught off guard. He's holding toys - the Stretch Armstrong and drawing tablet. 
WALTER Oh. Hey. 
Walter offers his hand to Ted. 
WALTER (CONT'D) You know we haven't really had a chance to talk yet. I know you're deciding who's vital to the transition. And I wanted to let you know what I do-- 
TED HENDRICKS You're vital here? 
WALTER I am. Totally. 
TED HENDRICKS Why are you holding toys? 
WALTER ...It's my birthday. 
TED HENDRICKS ...you wanted toys. 
WALTER No... Um, my sister gave me these. 
TED HENDRICKS (nodding at Walter's STRETCH ARMSTRONG) What does that do? 
WALTER My... (doesn't want to call it a TOY) ...item? 
TED HENDRICKS Yeah, you're toy. 
WALTER His arms and legs stretch outward. Um. But that's not-- I wanted, before we have the chance to talk, I need to discuss an asset situation with you. 
Walter begins to open his briefcase to stash the toys, but he's nervous so it drops. 
INT. TED HENDRICK'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER 
Walter's in Ted's glass partitioned work space. 
TED HENDRICKS (after being told it's lost, pissed) A photographic negative? I thought those had all been processed? 
WALTER I've processed the digitization of every single photograph in Life's library. Two million and eleven. But we haven't been able to locate this last negative. 
TED HENDRICKS I know. Because I've been asking for it. Because it's the Quintessence fucking one that I told my boss we had. It's the cover. You seriously lost a photographer's work? At Life? 
WALTER' MOM APPEARS ONCE MORE IN THE HALLWAY; she's out there, peeking into this office. 
WALTER I'm confident we'll find it. 
TED HENDRICKS Why are you confident we'll find it? 
Walter has no reason to be confident he'll find it. So he doesn't say anything. 
TED HENDRICKS (CONT'D) That doesn't give me confidence, a no-answer. You're in assets, I guess? 
WALTER Yes. 
TED HENDRICKS This doesn't reflect very well on you. 
Walter's at a loss. 
TED HENDRICKS (CONT'D) During an evaluation week. 
WALTER I've been here nine years-- 
TED HENDRICKS (gesturing out his cell PHONE) Here. Call Helmut Newton. Tell him you lost his picture. 
WALTER Helmut Newton didn't-- 
TED HENDRICKS Don't Helmut Newton me. 
WALTER I didn't Helmut Newton you. 
Of David After Dentist. 
But Walter has been miniaturized and morphed into a little boy, so finely done he's recognizable both as Walter and as famous little drugged-up, young David from the youtube phenomenon clip David After Dentist wherein a five-year-old boy was videotaped by his dad in a post-dental-visit painkiller haze. He's in a kid-seat in the back of an SUV trying to get his mental bearings (unsuccessfully). 
WALTER AS DAVID AFTER DENTIST I feel funny. Why is this happening? (EXISTENTIALLY BEWILDERED about where he is) ...Is this real life? 
Soon after, David arches up and roars some noise meant to express kid rage that he can't control his situation - but we're watching a grown man do it and it applies specifically to the frustrations and challenges of his grown-up life. 
Then, in Starbucks, Walter takes out his gift wallet from photographer Sean O'Connell. He looks at the inscription: 
From S.O. To Walter Mitty - Thanks for the great work. 
Then Walter looks at a further embossment on the back. It says Life's Purpose. It's the mission statement of his company. Walter believes in it. 
CUT TO: 
WHAT FOLLOWS IS A MONTAGE OF THE MOST CLASSIC PHOTOGRAPHS 
...on proud display at Life. These aren't simply celebrities or commemorations of familiar events - these are the results of the painstaking quest to fulfill the pledge of Life at its inception. Amid the pictures we glimpse parts of Life's Purpose engraved on the lobby wall. 
"To see life; 
to see the world; 
to eyewitness great events; 
to watch the faces of the poor 
More photos that reach this standard pass - American faces. Faces from all over the world. 
"to see man's work ­ 
his towers, 
discoveries and labor 
We see photos of men and women in pain, moments of deep pride, fear, uncertainty, glory. 
things hidden behind walls 
These are depictions of American plights - what devastating weather wrought, the sequestered lives of the deeply poor. 
things dangerous to come to; 
to see and to take pleasure in seeing; 
to see and be amazed; 
That is the purpose of Life. 
EXT. JFK, AIRPORT, TERMINAL - LATER 
Walter walks up a white terminal with his briefcase. He stops. He unsure he's going to go forward. Then he looks at his wallet again. 
Specifically the phrase Life's Purpose - to see the World. Things dangerous to come to. He's looking hard at the things dangerous to come to part. 
INT. EMIRATES AIRLINES DESK, JFK - LATER 
Walter buys a ticket at the desk of the national airline of the United Arab Emirates at the far western edge of terminal three. 
WALTER I need to buy a ticket, I think to Dubai. Because I'm going, actually, to Mogadishu (shit) which I think, I'm not allowed to do from here, because it's illegally dangerous. 
TICKET CLERK Yeah.. (punching in some stuff) That's right more or less.. 
INT. EMERITUS AIRLINE 747 - LATER 
Walter's the only guy on here without a headdress. He's still looking at the out of focus photograph he printed way back, hoping yet, that it will give him some indication of what the missing picture is. 
EXT. BAGGAGE CLAIM, DUBAI AIRPORT - DAY 
Walter is waiting for his bags to come around on the luggage carousel. They do - it's just his briefcase he's had with him for the film's entirety. But as he retrieves it, he makes the acquaintance of a group of traveling Danish teens by helping them lift their heavy backpacks from the carousel. 
WALTER Here you go. (like it's heavy) Whoa, what do you have in there? 
ULF Skateboards. Some switch out boards. 
These teens are boys Knud, Soren and Ulf. And girls Grys and Denll. 
WALTER I like your trucks. I used to skateboard. Where are you guys headed? 
SOREN Into Dubai. 
WALTER Yes. 
TED HENDRICKS COLLEAGUE Practical Assets. 
WALTER Yes. 
TED HENDRICKS COLLEAGUE Your pass key's not working because you've been let go. With cause. 
Walter is shaken. 
WALTER I need to speak to Ted. I found SEAN O'CONNELL-- 
NEW GUY Ted's been let go. We had an overage of 280,000 dollars. Due to this publishing delay. 
WALTER Is there someone who took over Ted's responsibilities? On a PERMANENT-- 
NEW GUY Yeah, that's me Steve Penders. (starting to leave) We're late for Squash. 
INT. SQUASH COURT, NYC - LATER 
Walter's on the squash court holding a conversation with these two guys who are trying to play squash. 
STEVE PENDERS This is the last-Life-cover situation? 
WALTER Yes. 
STEVE PENDERS You lost an asset. You cost that COMP-- 
WALTER I didn't lose it. I have it. The photographer told me. I just don't know where I have it. 
STEVE PENDERS Those are grounds-- 
WALTER Those are no grounds. You can't fire me for not having something that I have. 
STEVE PENDERS I'm not following you. 
Steve serves into Walter. 
WALTER I have it. I always have had it. When you fired me, I had it. Why are you trying to hit me with Squash balls? 
STEVE PENDERS You're on a squash court. I'm trying to play-- 
WALTER No one's informed me that I've been let go. 
STEVE PENDERS I'm informing you. 
WALTER I should be sent my November check. 
STEVE PENDERS Fired with cause. No picture. No CHECK 
WALTER There's no cause to keep my salary. Ow. 
Penders just served into Walter again. 
STEVE PENDERS Can you get off the fucking court here? 
WALTER I'd like to speak to your supervisor. 
STEVE PENDERS You can't. 
WALTER I demand to speak to your supervisor. 
STEVE PENDERS You can't do that either. 
WALTER I'd like to demand to speak to your supervisor. 
STEVE PENDERS I don't work at Comcast. I don't have a supervisor you can just talk to. My supervisor is Mark Chatham. He owns The Timms Company. Which is a holding company that holds conglomerates. He's in Los Angeles for the G8 summit, and he wouldn't talk to you anyway even if you were stuck in a fucking elevator. That's my supervisor. 
WALTER The Purpose of Life-- 
STEVE PENDERS Go. 
WALTER Hey, fuck you, man. 
There's been a little bit of a shoving, shoulder thing. It's getting a little hot. 
INT. BUS, MOVING, NY - LATER 
Walter's on the bus. He's looking at the out of focus print again. 
WALTER (TO HIMSELF) What is this? 
EDNA Sure you do. Everybody does. 
Walter thinks about it. Then Edna kisses him. 
EDNA (CONT'D) Thanks for taking care of us, Walter. 
Walter sits there for a moment. He is the man of the family. He's got to go out into the world and get something done. 
WALTER (rising to leave) I have to go somewhere, mom. Possibly I'll be reachable by phone. 
EXT. NYC - LATER 
This is New York at lunch hour. Walter's out there with everybody. It's the same kind of Manhattan scene we've seen before, but here everybody around Walter's walking to their dream jobs. There's a large female jockey. A black matador, an elderly magician, etc. A wider view reveals a block full of men and women headed for jobs that were not "fall back" jobs but longed-for walks of life - astronaut, beekeeper, rodeo clown, Supreme Court Judge, a city-block full of who are visibly living dreams. It's a colorful environment. Except for one normal looking guy beside Walter. 
WALTER What are you? 
NORMAL GUY Stay at home dad. 
WALTER Cool. 
NORMAL GUY Congratulations. 
WALTER Thanks, man. 
Walter looks normal. But he's holding a trophy. This is what he's just been congratulated over. 
NORMAL GUY Is that a Grammy? Or a Nobel-- 
WALTER Grammy. Best male R & B vocal performance. 
NORMAL GUY Way to go. 
WALTER You, too. 
Walter (with his trophy) crosses the street with the whole massive host of dream job-going New York commuters - a thousand of them. 
EXT. SUBWAY STATION, BROOKLYN - LATER 
Walter back in the working world, runs up a platform to catch a train that's nearly leaving. 
INT. TERMINAL, JFK - LATER 
Walter's at Etihad Airways booking desk. It's a shabby airline. It's a shabby-looking desk. There's only one clerk and Walter's the only one in line. 
ETIHAD CLERK There's only one flight to Nepal, in the next 18 hours. 
WALTER That's okay. 
ETIHAD CLERK (checking his computer) But there aren't any seats left. 
WALTER (DISAPPOINTED) None? 
ETIHAD CLERK I'm afraid not. 
WALTER ...Not one? 
ETIHAD CLERK Well, there's one seat, but... 
He looks around like he shouldn't be selling it, like it's not by the books, but he'll do it. 
INT. LAVATORY, ETIHAD AIRLINE FLIGHT, FLYING - DAY 
Walter's sitting in the airplane lavatory. He's not using it. He's just riding on it. It's the seat he just bought. Someone knocks. So Walter has to get up and leave for a moment. 
We jump cut through Walter doing this several times. Then we find him during a nice quiet stretch, where he can sit on the lavatory seat uninterrupted for a couple minutes. During this time we watch him take out his wallet - the gift from Sean O'Connell. Walter looks at it 
CLOSE ON THE "LIFE'S PURPOSE" CREDO 
Specifically we're looking at the line "...the Purpose of Life." 
Walter's looking at this embossment on his wallet. He's lost faith anyone besides him takes it to heart. Walter no longer does either. So he discards the wallet in the lav trash. Then someone knocks on the lav door after which Walter must rise and leave the lavatory once more. 
EXT. ZHENGMO, NEPAL - DAY 
A small bus drives slowly up the single mountain road through the town of Zhengmo, Nepal. 
INT. BUS, MOVING, ZHENGMO - SAME 
Walter rides on this bus. There is a great deal to look at and marvel over out the window. Walter's doing that. 
EXT. VILLAGE TRAVELING LODGE, VILLAGE OF QUENN, NEPAL - LATER 
EHARMONY COUNSELOR Hey, Walter. Why didn't you submit any pictures? Most people have photos of them with friends, out on the town. 
WALTER I don't really do a lot of, you know, swinging. 
EHARMONY COUNSELOR Swinging? 
WALTER Yeah. 
EHARMONY COUNSELOR Swinging means fucking married people. When you're married. 
WALTER Oh. I don't mean that. 
EHARMONY COUNSELOR No. 
WALTER I meant like partying, I guess. I used to like to be at work at 8. And I have some family demands that keep me pretty busy. 
EHARMONY COUNSELOR Your mom and sister. 
WALTER Yeah. 
EHARMONY COUNSELOR You know. People don't know they're leaning on you. Until you move. And they fall. 
WALTER (not in the mood for ADVICE) Are you Chinese? You're so wise. 
EHARMONY COUNSELOR I'm neither. But I know you, Walter. I've been studying you here. You seem to carry a lot of weight. 
WALTER Well, I'm not going to move and let the people who lean on me fall, because the people who lean on me are my mom and my sister. 
EHARMONY COUNSELOR Are you in a bad mood? 
WALTER A little. 
EHARMONY COUNSELOR Well, let's keep rounding this profile out. What do you do during your downtime? 
WALTER I don't get a lot. But I guess if I had to say - mostly I just consider thoughts... for my visions for ideas and scenarios about the world. 
EHARMONY COUNSELOR (like that sentence doesn't actually mean ANYTHING) You consider thoughts for your visions for ideas and scenarios about the world? 
WALTER Yeah. 
EHARMONY COUNSELOR You daydream? 
Todd has gotten to the heart of the matter. 
EHARMONY COUNSELOR (CONT'D) You know, studies show that people who spend a great deal of time fantasizing and daydreaming, doodling and shit they're not really that happy. 
SEAN ...Hey, man, do you mind? 
Walter has come upon, without realizing it, some kind of snow nest camp, camouflaged among trees. Photographer Sean O'Connell is camped there with his gear. Walter looks at him. 
SEAN (CONT'D) I'm trying to photograph a snow leopard. 
WALTER ...Sean? 
SEAN Yeah. 
WALTER (TO TODD) Hey, I got to go. 
EHARMONY COUNSELOR No problem. Congratulations. You're on eHarmony. 
WALTER Cool. 
Walter hangs his phone up. He looks at Sean. 
WALTER (CONT'D) Sean O'Connell? 
SEAN Yeah. 
WALTER Walter. Mitty. 
SEAN Walter. Seriously. What the fuck? What are you-- 
WALTER I've been looking for you. 
SEAN Sit down. 
Walter sits by the fire with Sean. 
SEAN (CONT'D) ...Are you okay? 
WALTER Yeah, warming up. 
ODESSA (O.S.) But didn't we get the Villa so we can put Mom's piano in it? 
WALTER Yeah. 
The situation makes no sense. But it's where they've found themselves. 
WALTER (CONT'D) It's "f"d up. I know. But if I don't get my severance I'm going to have to forfeit that deposit, because I can't afford the room. And I won't have enough to get her another place. Another decent place. 
ODESSA (O.S.) So we may end up having to pay for a bigger room because it can hold a piano by selling that piano? And then having to pay for the bigger empty room for a year. 
WALTER Yeah. 
ODESSA (O.S.) ....Did you get everything you wanted? For your birthday. 
WALTER Almost? 
ODESSA (O.S.) What's left? 
WALTER Nothing I just want everyone in the world to be Morgan Freeman. So it would just be me and Morgan Freemans, in the whole world. 
ODESSA (O.S.) (SMILING) What about me? 
WALTER You'd be you. But like a combo with him. Just a little calmer, more quiet. Gentler. 
ODESSA (O.S.) Would I have push-back hair and freckles? 
WALTER Yeah. 
ODESSA (V.O.) Where are you? 
WALTER Los Angeles. 
ODESSA (O.S.) Are you okay? You sound tired. 
WALTER I'm okay. I'm going to take the train to my hotel. Try to get home tomorrow. 
ODESSA (O.S.) I love you. 
WALTER I love you, too. 
EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - LATER 
This is a huge shot of downtown. We pan back around and find we're in a metro train. Walter's there. He's nearing his stop. So he rises, and he walks past his rowmate to the aisle, but he's jostled her accidentally. 
WALTER I'm sorry. 
She's a fifteen-year Puerto Rican girl (who's Morgan Freeman). 
15-YR-OLD-PUERTO-RICAN GIRL MORGAN FREEMAN (Morgan freeman's voice) Don't worry about it. 
She's been morphed with Morgan Freeman -- still Puerto Rican but also Morgan Freeman. We notice elsewhere around Walter this has happened; everyone in his vicinity (the train he's walking off) has a combination with Morgan Freeman's features - Korean Morgan Freemans, Transit Police Freemans, six-year- olds. Black ones. Everyone around, morphed with the familiar characteristics of the dignified and peaceful actor. Walter has a hundred Morgan Freemans around him. It's a good world. Walter walks in the midst of it all. 
EXT. 2ND STREET, DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - LATER 
Walter, walking with his briefcase, has reached a street corner farther east in downtown L.A. The Morgan Freemans have left him. It's the regular world. Walter's trying to cross up 2nd Street, but he's found a police barricade there. 
COP You can't go this way without a summit pass. 
WALTER What's a summit pass? 
COP For the G8. 
WALTER I'm trying to get to my hotel. 
COP ... protests are on 3rd street. 
Walter watches a series of limos drive by; they're bound for their downtown hotel and the summit there. Walter recalls an association to this. The director of his corporation's attending. 
WALTER My boss, the guy who runs my company is here. Is it cool if I talked to him. Am I allowed? 
COP This is America. You can do whatever you want as long as you stay on the far sides of the barricades on 3rd. 
WALTER There's a work situation I want to clue him in on. I was let go with cause. But there wasn't-- 
COP Hey. Keep walking, okay? I've got a job to do. 
INT. TIME-LIFE BUILDING, NYC - LATER 
The TVs are on in the corporate board rooms, no one's watching but if they were, they'd see news report from MSNBC from the G8 summit in Los Angeles 
FEMALE NEWS REPORTER It's a tense environment. To be sure. There are fears of a repeat of the violence in Seattle at the WTO. And there are three thousand more protestors here today. 
WALTER (CONT'D) (through the megaphone) There're assets in that bag. They're my responsi-- 
Two police officers have moved in on Walter because he's the only protestor holding his ground and not fleeing (because he wants his briefcase) 
WALTER (CONT'D) (through the megaphone) I'm just trying to finish my job. Ask. I'm Walter Mitty. I'm a man. 
A TEAR-GAS CANNISTER LANDS AT WALTER'S FEET. But he remains there. He starts to call over (through the megaphone) to Mark Chatham forty yards away on the hotel steps. 
WALTER (CONT'D) (through the megaphone) Sir? I'm Walter Mitty! I'm a man! 
The cops are getting rough with him. 
WALTER (CONT'D) (through the megaphone) I am Walter Mitty! I'm a man! I need to just snag my briefcase. I'm a man! Let me do my fucking job! 
Walter has fought through the cops, now he fights through the horses to reach his briefcase. 
WALTER (CONT'D) Horses! 
Walter's choking on the teargas but he won't quit. He's finally fought his way to his briefcase. 
INT. TIME-LIFE BUILDING, NYC - LATER 
They're watching this on the news at Life. It's a riot. Like Seattle. On screen, Walter's image has a beautiful thing to it - it's like Tank Man. 
A company man standing there in a short-sleeve dress shirt, getting tear-gassed, fighting to get out of there with his briefcase. 
WALTER I'm Walter Mitty! I'm a man! 
Ulf and Soren arrive at his side and try to drag him back from an approaching flank of LA riot police. They want these kids stepping back. Walter's not. When they reach him, there's a dust-up with Ulf. More kids get in the mix. It's going to get out of hand; the police are too rough, the kids too dumb to move. Walter's in the middle of it all. Soon, there are some wild punches. Then everyone in the scrum must fight to keep their teeth in their mouth. It's all broken loose. Walter's fighting it out like everyone else. More kids have run in. Some others, too, older. 
PROTESTOR I'm a man! 
The kids start yelling this, too. 
YOUNGER PROTESTORS I'm a man! 
There's like eight people yelling this now. 
Over where there's just a lot of people safely observing, along the sidewalks, some more down to earth types, older people, family people, this message is starting to hit. There's a 60-year-old WORKING MAN there. He's admiring Walter's guts. 
WORKING MAN ...you're goddamned right. 
INT. TIME-LIFE BUILDING, NYC - SAME 
Back on the boardroom TVs we see that CNN is broadcasting a report on the riot. 
REPORTER Known only as "I'm a man Man." This brave protestor was tear-gassed then just "f"ing hammered with nightsticks. I'm sorry I'm losing some professionalism. But this guy just wouldn't back down. Let him get his briefcase. Jeez. 
On screen, there is further footage from the G8. Walter's in the middle of a pack really getting worked over by fired-up police. 
EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - SAME 
We have a helicopter view of the G8 scene, there's a huge concert going on, the summit across the street and the street in between swelling with a mob of people. 
RADIO HOST (O.S.) All right Los Angeles County. You're on Talk 360. What do you think of "I'm a man" Man? 
CALLER (LATINO) Like the guy's style. He's just letting the world now "don't walk all over me." Wasn't that on one of our old flags and shit?" He's a human man. Those corporations own the cops, man. You know that. Do you not? 
EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - SAME 
On the streets, outside the summit, lots of the crowd is yelling "I'm a man." You can hear Rage Against the Machine soundchecking across the street. 
EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - LATER 
it's important to note that the source footage for most of what follows is the actual hand-held video captures of the cop-baiting Rage Against the Machine daytime concert staged among five city blocks outside the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles. Five thousand angry, anti- establishment young people - 2,000 police officers wearing riot gear, as well as additional horses, motorcycles, squad cars and police helicopters, all captured in raw frames Walter has been very naturally included in. He's trying to walk through the crowd, find his way home through it (this is the free provocative downtown concert the reporter mentioned) but he's being recognized. 
KID It's I'm a Man Man. 
Walter's trying to find his Danish friends. 
WALTER Ulf? 
Walter's being rubbed on the head by way of congratulations, recognized from what he did earlier. Pretty soon he's up (sort of against his will) on their shoulders. Rage Against the Machine has begun Bulls On Parade - it's an anti- establishment classic. On stage: 
LEAD SINGER ZACH DE LA ROCHA Brothers and sisters, Our democracy has been hijacked. All your true freedoms in this country are over, as long as it's controlled by corporations. (NOTICING WALTER) Is that that motherfucker from the fight? 
Back in the crowd, they're riled up. They start passing Walter forward (atop them) like a beach ball. 
ZACH DE LA ROCHA Pass him up here. (starting the song) 
The song kicks in. It's an electric area now. The song's powerful. The crowd's starting to feel like a mob. Walter's still a beach ball they're sending up to the stage. He crosses seventy feet on his back, passed up by a couple hundred hands. Soon the crowd has him on the stage. Right among the band. 
TODD MAHAR Yeah. Traffic's tough. But it's a cool city. If you get bored here, man, it's your fault. 
WALTER You look different. 
TODD MAHAR Than what? 
WALTER Than I pictured. I pictured you wearing an old time judge's wig. The whole time. 
TODD MAHAR The whole time we talked you pictured me in a judge's wig? 
Walter's cell has started ringing. 
WALTER Hello? 
WOMAN'S VOICE Hi this is Cynthia Despihg. With Etihad Airlines. Is this Walter Mitty? 
WALTER Yeah, hey. 
WOMAN'S VOICE We found your wallet. I think. 
This has surprised Walter. He's gone quiet. 
WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D) Are you a Walter Mitty who flew to Nepal Wednesday the 15th? 
WALTER Yes I'm a Walter Mitty who did that. 
WOMAN'S VOICE We have your wallet. It's at our Los Angeles terminal office. 
WALTER I'm in Los Angeles. With pancakes. (after a moment) I don't know why I just said that. I'm excited. 
WOMAN'S VOICE It's exciting to get your wallet back when you thought you lost it. 
WALTER ...for sure. 
WOMAN'S VOICE Maintenance found it in a trash receptacle. You must have ACCIDENTALLY-- 
WALTER Yeah. 
WOMAN'S VOICE Our luggage delivery car can get it to you. She's going out now. 
WALTER (NEARLY OVERWHELMED) ...thank you. 
EXT. INTERNATIONAL HOUSE OF PANCAKES, LOS ANGELES - LATER 
Walter and Todd Mahar wait out in front of IHOP, under the IHOP overhang, waiting for Walter's wallet to arrive in the parking lot.  every once in a while, when Walter looks at Todd, Todd's wearing an old time judge's wig. 
WALTER Do I look like you pictured? 
TODD MAHAR Yep. Pretty normal looking guy. 
This didn't really jack Walter up. 
TODD MAHAR (CONT'D) You look normal. But you're not. You're a pretty interesting guy Walter. 
A car pulls up. 
TODD MAHAR (CONT'D) I'm glad you got out of the office. It's good to meet you. 
A young woman (middle-eastern, 20s) has left the small car. She's walking up to Walter; she's got his wallet. 
ETIHAD AIRLINES LUGGAGE GIRL Are you Walter Mitty? 
WALTER Yeah. 
ETIHAD AIRLINES LUGGAGE GIRL Here you go. 
She hands Walter his wallet. 
ETIHAD AIRLINES LUGGAGE GIRL (CONT'D) That's really beautiful. 
WALTER What's that? 
ETIHAD AIRLINES LUGGAGE GIRL What it says. Life's Purpose. 
She looks at Walter for a while. 
ETIHAD AIRLINES LUGGAGE GIRL (CONT'D) To see things hidden behind walls, to take pleasure in seeing, to see and be amazed, that is the purpose of Life. I really like that. I'm glad you got it back. 
WALTER Yeah. I appreciate it. That was cool of you guys. 
ETIHAD AIRLINES LUGGAGE GIRL (LEAVING) Have a nice night. 
MARK CHATHAM I saw you on TV fighting a mailbox. 
A long time passes. 
WALTER Was that a question? 
MARK CHATHAM Not like in the form that I just said it. But... 
Walter still doesn't say anything about his participation in a riot. So Mark rephrases it. 
MARK CHATHAM (CONT'D) Why were you fighting a mailbox? 
WALTER I guess I was revved up. 
MARK CHATHAM From what? 
WALTER From fighting with a piano for a month and trying to get someone at my company to evaluate my position there based on understanding what I actually do. 
MARK CHATHAM You fight pianos, too? 
WALTER Not in the way that I fought the mailbox, but just in the way that I've been struggling with one. 
MARK CHATHAM (recounting Walter having told him this moments AGO) You rode in a car on a boat? 
WALTER Yes. 
MARK CHATHAM You slept on a copier in a business center? 
WALTER Yes. 
MARK CHATHAM You're an interesting guy. 
WALTER (pleased to hear this) Someone else told me that. An hour ago. Hey, I don't want to take up too much more of your time. But I'd like my severance. There's no cause to keep it from me. That's what I was trying to tell you downtown. I did my job well for nine years. 
MARK CHATHAM That's all you were trying to say downtown? 
WALTER Yeah. 
Some moments go by next, while Mark and Walter sit Indian style with the Sean O'Connell photo of Walter sitting between them. 
MARK CHATHAM I'm going to run some numbers. 
Mark has stood up and started in to his hotel room. Walter's been following him. 
MARK CHATHAM (CONT'D) (meaning don't follow me IN) Not right now. I don't even know where the numbers are. There in some guy's computer. Show up Monday, let's see. 
The door closes, Walter's left out there to wait. 
EXT. SUBWAY STATION, BROOKLYN - NIGHT 
Walter has returned to Brooklyn; he's heading up a set of Subway stairs up to a neighborhood street. 
INT. TIME-LIFE BUILDING, NYC - DAY 
Walter crosses the huge lobby, dressed as always for work. 
INT. ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER 
Walter has entered the elevator. He's alone. It won't work without his floor elevator key (which stopped working once he was let go). Walter waits a moment. Then he tries his key. The button illuminates. Walter starts to ascend. 
INT. WALTER'S DIVISION FLOOR, CORRIDOR - LATER 
Walter has reached the floor elevator corridor door to his division floor office. He's just tried his pass key. That functions as well. 
INT. ACCOUNTING OFFICE - LATER 
Walter waits in a line at an accounting office window counter (like a DMV) behind recently let-go colleagues Tim Naughton and Gary Mannheim. Tim speaks to the accounting clerk. 
TIM NAUGHTON Tim Naughton? Severance package? 
She hands Tim his check. He's sad, but he takes it and heads off. 
GARY MANNHEIM Gary Mannheim. Same. 
After a moment, Gary gets his severance. He's also blue about it. Then Walter steps up. 
WALTER Walter Mitty? Is there a... possibly there's a severance package for me? 
She starts typing into her keyboard. 
WALTER (CONT'D) I was fired for cause, but then I think I maybe gave them cause to provide me with a severance package.

Emily gets up, pulling the blanket with her to hide her body. Kumail holds onto it, stopping her progress. 
KUMAIL Wait we haven't even had sex again yet. 
She tugs the blanket, he lets go. She dresses behind it. 
EMILY No. No. I'm really not that kind of girl. I only have sex once on a first date. Plus a hand job. 
KUMAIL Well I haven't had that yet! 
Emily laughs. 
EMILY You don't get that because you made fun of me. 
KUMAIL What is happening right now? What are you doing? 
EMILY I'm changing under this blanket. 
KUMAIL I've seen everything. Do you remember, we were just having sex? 
EMILY Yeah, but you were in the throes of passion then. Listen, I had a really nice time. Thank you very much. I'm just gonna call an Uber and go home. 
Emily pulls out her PHONE, calls an Uber. Kumail's phone makes a noise. They exchange a look. 
KUMAIL Your driver will be ready as soon as he puts on his pants. 
EMILY Were you available for rides while we were fucking? 
KUMAIL Yeah, but I only looked a couple of times. 
INT. KUMAIL'S CAR - LATER 
Kumail Ubers Emily home. Emily sits in the back. 
KUMAIL So. Maybe I'll run into you at the club sometime and we can grab a drink? 
EMILY I'm not really - I know this sounds like a line - but I'm not really dating right now. I have a lot of school and work and just a lot on my plate. 
KUMAIL That's perfect because I'm not really dating right now either. I actually have a pretty strict two-day rule where I can't see someone more than two days in a row. So since we hung out for two days, if I were to see you again, which I won't because you're not dating, I'm not dating, I wouldn't be able to see you until Monday. 
EMILY We haven't hung out for two days. We've hung out for about five hours. Just to like, be totally clear. 
KUMAIL Yesterday and today. Cause it's after midnight, today is actually tomorrow. Earlier tonight was yesterday. So two days. 
EMILY You see, I don't date time nerds, so that really takes you off the table. 
KUMAIL That works out, because I am a hard core time nerd. 
EMILY Yeah, I can tell. 
KUMAIL I'm like, very strict about AM/PM stuff. 
EMILY So wait, just to establish, what did we just decide? 
KUMAIL We decided we aren't ever going to see each other again. 
EMILY Great. I'm glad we're on the same page. 
INT. KUMAIL'S PARENTS DINING ROOM - BRUNCH 
Kumail is eating brunch with his father, AZMAT, his mother SHARMEEN, his brother, NAVEED, and his sister-in- law, FATIMA. 
Azmat Look at these jeans, Kumi. They're from Citizens of Humanity, that's the brand's name. Touch them. They're so soft. 
KUMAIL I don't want to touch your jeans. 
AZMAT They're like sweatpants. You should be stylish like your father. It's not very difficult. Just observe me. 
NAVEED Get some Daddy Style. 
SHARMEEN Kumi, why don't you grow a beard? Not like Naveed's, just a small one. 
AZMAT Maybe like mine, small and stylish. 
SHARMEEN Kumi, I've been thinking, you know, why you don't enroll for LSAT now? 
KUMAIL Yeah sorry, Ma. I haven't done it yet. I like that you bring it up as though you've never brought it up before. 
NAVEED How's the stand-up coming Bhai? 
KUMAIL It's from the show. Thank you. 
INT. KUMAIL'S PARENTS HOUSE - LATER 
Sharmeen and Kumail are seeing Zubeida out. 
SHARMEEN I hope you come back. 
Zubeida exits, Sharmeen looks at Kumail expectantly. 
SHARMEEN (CONT'D) Kumi, there's not going to be a magic spark, okay? You have to work at it. You have to stay open. 
KUMAIL Okay, Ma, yeah. I just wish you were better at it, you know? (MORE) 
KUMAIL (CONT'D) I mean you've had so much practice and you're still not that good at it! 
SHARMEEN Ha. Ha. Ha. 
KUMAIL You brought your A-game with Naveed, but then with me, you're kind of just phoning it in a little bit. 
SHARMEN Again with the comedy, the comedy. All the time with the comedy. Be serious! 
KUMAIL I am serious! That's why I want to help you get better! 
INT. KUMAIL'S APARTMENT - LATER 
Kumail puts the HEADSHOT in the cigar box with a bunch of other pictures of Pakistani women. 
INT. KUMAIL'S CAR - LATER 
Kumail drives Emily. She is in the back seat again. 
EMILY So, are you ever going to let me sit in the front seat? 
KUMAIL No, I'm a professional. And you're paying for this ride. 
EMILY I don't want to pay for this ride! It's surging right now. 
KUMAIL Yeah, sorry. You shouldn't have typed in the number. 
INT. KUMAIL'S APARTMENT - LATER 
Emily and Kumail on the couch in front of the TV. 
KUMAIL Okay. The year is 1969. MGM has had a string of failures. So, it turns to its most bankable star, Vincent Price. 
EMILY Is this your compatibility test? Like, the way people are with Vonnegut or The Big Lebowski? 
KUMAIL No! Just watch the movie. And take it seriously. 
EMILY I'm going to love it. I love it when men test me on my taste. 
KUMAIL I just want to share this movie with you, so I don't know why you're reading into- 
EMILY How many women have you shown this movie to? 
KUMAIL Zero. 
EMILY How many women have you shown a B Horror movie to on like, a third date. 
KUMAIL This is not a B horror movie. 
Emily laughs. 
KUMAIL (CONT'D) Okay, you ready? Just close your eyes cause when the menu comes up, there's some spoilers in the menu. 
EMILY I'm ready, I'm ready! 
KUMAIL Ok, I'll hit play. 
LATER, Kumail checks out Emily's reaction, she doesn't seem into it. 
KUMAIL (CONT'D) Watch! 
EMILY I'm watching! 
KUMAIL Shhhhhh! Watch this part. 
EMILY Stop watching me! 
Emily with Kumail and his friends: CJ and Mary. 
CJ Emily, has Kumail told you that in addition to being an Uber driver he also has a one-man show? 
EMILY No, he did not tell me that.   Do you really? 
KUMAIL It's really nothing. It's just something I'm fiddling around with. 
EMILY How is a one man show different from stand-up? 
KUMAIL It's really not. 
MARY There's lots of wigs and costume changes. 
CJ There's a lot of acting in it. 
MARY And then like at the end of it, you've got this very awkward conversation where you go, "I really liked it." 
KUMAIL But I thought you really liked it! 
MARY I really liked it. 
EMILY I can't wait to see the show. 
KUMAIL You will never see the show... 
CJ You have to see the show. 
MARY You have to see it. 
KUMAIL It's not ready. 
CJ You will love the acting. 
KUMAIL They're fucking with you.   It's not really like that. 
EMILY Are they fucking with me or you? It seems like they're fucking with you. 
INT. PLAYGROUND THEATER - STAGE - NIGHT 
Tiny theater, sparsely attended (Emily, her friend JESSIE, Mary and CJ). On stage is a kid's room. A NINJA TURTLES POSTER, a PRAYER MAT. 
KUMAIL I'm twelve years old. This...this is home. Feels like I never left. Do you smell that? That's my mom cooking the Murgh Roghen Joash. 
CJ (quietly, in the audience) Fuck. 
KUMAIL Do you hear that? That's my father watching cricket on the telly. Do you feel that? That's the weight of Pakistan's history. 
TIME CUT TO: 
A MAP OF PAKISTAN is behind Kumail. 
KUMAIL (CONT'D) Pakistan was formed when it separated from its biggest rival, India, on August 14th 1947.

CJ stretches in the audience. 
JESSIE (quietly, from the audience) I have to leave as soon as the show's over. I can't stay. 
Emily nods in understanding. 
KUMAIL So if you get a Silly Mid On fielder, you know you're getting a Yorker soon. 
TIME CUT TO: 
Return to the MAP OF PAKISTAN 
KUMAIL (CONT'D) So to review, Pakistan's biggest exports are cotton and... 
KUMAIL It's 24 hours. Why?   You want an old lemon meringue pie? 
EMILY You're so funny! Actually, no, I just...I really need to get a cup of coffee. 
KUMAIL I can make you coffee. 
EMILY I love diner coffee.     That burnt taste. 
KUMAIL All right, I'll come with you. 
EMILY No, no! Why would you do that? 
KUMAIL It's a bad neighborhood. I'm not gonna let you go on your own. 
EMILY Why cause I'm a woman? Seriously, that's the most misogynist thing I've ever heard. 
KUMAIL Why are you being so weird? 
EMILY Fuck you, I'm not being weird. 
KUMAIL You're being so weird. 
EMILY Fuck you. You're being weird!    You're being so weird! 
KUMAIL How am I weird? I want to sleep while it's sleep time. 
EMILY This is normal. Girls go to get coffee in the middle of the night. Have you never had a girlfriend before? This is what it's like. 
KUMAIL Are you okay? 
EMILY Everything is not okay. Everything is not okay. 
KUMAIL You can tell me anything, you know that right? You can tell me anything. 
EMILY I have to take a shit, okay? I have to take a huge fucking dookie. I can't take a poo in your bathroom because you don't have any matches and you don't have any air freshener. What kind of person doesn't have any matches or air freshener in the bathroom? The walls are so thin! And Chris is right out there. 
Kumail starts laughing. 
EMILY (CONT'D) Please stop laughing! Please, please. 
KUMAIL Okay, I have an idea. 
EXT. KUMAIL'S HOUSE- MOMENTS LATER 
Kumail sits on the stoop outside. After a beat, Emily sheepishly walks out and sits next to him. 
KUMAIL How are you? 
EMILY I do not want to talk about it. 
INT. BATTING CAGES - DAY 
Naveed fully geared up: batting helmet, gloves, elbow pad, eye-black. Kumail behind the backstop, watching. 
NAVEED Watch and learn, Bhai. It's all about shifting weight and torque. 
A BALL ZINGS at Naveed, he misses completely. 
NAVEED (CONT'D) Oh Christ! 
KUMAIL Oh. 
Another ball zings. Misses again. 
KUMAIL (CONT'D) You're like a Pakistani Sammy Sosa. 
An 8-year old KID in a cage nearby cracks a clean hit. 
KUMAIL (CONT'D) Hey he's pretty good. Just do what he's doing. 
Naveed throws down his bat and exits the cage. 
INT. BATTING CAGE SNACK SHACK - LATER 
Kumail and Naveed eat from tiffins & ramekins. They fork- fight over their meal. 
NAVEED Mine. 
KUMAIL Come on. 
KUMAIL It's not freaking me out. 
EMILY I don't wanna put pressure on you. And I know it's only been a few months. (MORE) 
EMILY (CONT'D) But I just wanted to tell you that I am completely overwhelmed by you. It's the last thing I was expecting. 
KUMAIL This is also the last thing I was expecting and I also feel completely overwhelmed by you. 
EMILY That's a weird thing to say. 
KUMAIL Why? I just said what you said. Exactly what you said. 
EMILY Yeah, but it wasn't weird when I said it.   It's okay. 
INT. KUMAIL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Emily watches Kumail sleep. 
INT. TRADER JOE'S - NIGHT 
Kumail and Emily grocery shop. 
EMILY So listen, my parents are coming to town this weekend. Maybe you wanna come for lunch? 
KUMAIL Oh, we can't because of the two-day rule, right? You'll come to Mary's party Friday night and then you'll probably spend the night. So I won't be able to see you until Monday, so... 
EMILY Okay. Well, I would love to meet your parents. They live in the city, right? 
KUMAIL Well, they live in the suburbs. You know, I don't really see them very much. 
EMILY Have they asked about me? What do they think? Do they want to meet me? My parents want to meet you. 
KUMAIL Of course, of course. They're dying to meet you. 
Emily stumbles. 
EMILY Ow... oh my god.. 
KUMAIL Are you okay? What happened? 
EMILY Totally fine. 
KUMAIL Do you need assistance? 
EMILY I think I just tweaked my ankle. I took this stupid hip hop dance class last weekend. 
KUMAIL You should get it looked at. Do you want ice? 
EMILY Look, I'm walking on it. I'm totally fine. 
KUMAIL Can I get you a bag of ice? I can carry you? I can carry you the rest of the day? 
EMILY Kumail, seriously, stop. 
INT. KUMAIL'S APARTMENT - NEXT MORNING 
Emily is eating cereal in bed. Kumail is in the kitchen making coffee. 
KUMAIL (calling out) Hey, I liked your friends.     That Craig guy or was it Greg? (MORE) 
KUMAIL (CONT'D) I can never tell with those names. I'm glad I like him cause I don't want to have to come up with excuses to avoid him, you know. Like, oh no, I have kite surfing tonight. 
Emily opens the cigar box and sees the headshots of the women. She flips through them. 
KUMAIL (O.S.) (CONT'D) Did you know in the UK it's pronounced "Crayg". Which is good because that's actually how it's written, right? He's a "Crate" guy. 
Kumail enters. 
KUMAIL (CONT'D) (sees her with the box) I was going to tell you about that. 
EMILY Are you like judging Pakistan's Next Top Model or something? Seriously, who are these women? 
KUMAIL You know how we have arranged marriage in my culture? These are those women. 
EMILY These are women in Pakistan who want to marry you? 
KUMAIL They're not in Pakistan. 
EMILY You've met these women? 
CJ Is that what you want? 
KUMAIL It's amazing. It's the same material. 
SAM What do people say? 
AUDIENCE Sam! 
SAM People say what? 
AUDIENCE Sam! 
SAM I'm Sam Highsmith. Thank you very much! 
Sam exits the stage. 
KUMAIL I'm gonna tell him. I'm gonna tell him how I actually feel about it. 
Sam passes. 
KUMAIL (CONT'D) Great set, dude! 
CJ fistbumps Sam. 
SAM Crushing it! 
KUMAIL Love the new stuff! 
Sam exits. 
KUMAIL (CONT'D) We should be ashamed of ourselves. 
CJ We're weak. 
INT. KUMAIL'S PARENTS HOUSE- NIGHT 
The family is in the living room with, KHADIJA, another Pakistani girl. 
KHADIJA I wouldn't really call it an obsession but... I'm pretty good at magic. 
SHARMEEN Can you make his belly disappear? 
AZMAT No, I'm too happy with my belly. 
KHADIJA Does anyone have a dollar? 
AZMAT I will give you something. 
Azmat hands her a bill. 
KHADIJA 20? Big spender. Andrew Jackson? Don't you think he'd look cool with sunglasses? 
She draws a pair of sunglasses on top of Andrew Jackson's head, and folds the bill. 
KHADIJA (CONT'D) We sprinkle the magic dust on. 
Khadija makes a sprinkling motion with her fingers over the folded up bill. 
KUMAIL Yeah, you can't do it without the magic dust. 
KHADIJA Yeah, I need it. All right... 
She snaps her fingers. 
KHADIJA (CONT'D) Ok. Watching carefully - 
Khadija unfolds the bill. Andrew Jackson is now wearing the sunglasses. 
FATIMA That is amazing! And he does look better with glasses! 
KUMAIL How did you do that? 
KHADIJA Oh no, a magician never reveals her tricks. Here's your twenty back, Mr. Nanjiani. 
AZMAT Do you think I could use this twenty dollar bill to buy something? 
KHADIJA It looks better now, right? 
Kumail shares a look with Sharmeen. 
EXT. CITY VIEW     HOSPITAL - LATER 
A MASSIVE HOSPITAL looms over a quiet residential area. 
INT. CITY VIEW HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT 
Kumail walks up to the reception desk. 
KUMAIL Hi. I am looking for Emily Gardner. Um, Emily Gardner? She was checked in... 
A MAN is rolled in a stretcher by EMTs.   The nurses run off. 
INT. HOSPITAL - MOMENTS LATER 
Kumail walks by curtained beds hearing screams, wailing, moaning. He finally sees Emily in a bed, hooked up to wires and monitors. She looks scared, a bit sedated. 
KUMAIL Hey. 
EMILY What are you doing here? 
KUMAIL Jessie called me and wanted me to make sure you were okay. So how are you doing? 
EMILY Fine. Totally fine. Never been better. A thousand percent fine. Just like fainted a little at work. I didn't have breakfast this morning. 
KUMAIL Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. You know that. 
NURSE BETTE Ms. Gardner. Your room will be ready soon. Okay? 
EMILY Oh, no, actually I'd love to go home and sleep in my own bed. 
NURSE BETTE Sir, can you step outside a moment, please? If you want to stay you have to go to the security desk to get a pass. 
KUMAIL Where is the security desk? 
NURSE BETTE It's downstairs. Exactly where you walked in. At the security desk. 
KUMAIL The security desk is at the security desk. Got it. 
INT. EMILY'S ICU ROOM   - LATER 
Emily is propped up. Kumail next to her. He has a badge. 
KUMAIL Can I get you something? Water. Juice. Coffee? 
Emily is essentially passed out. Kumail isn't sure what to do. NURSE JUDY brings in a doctor. DR. WRIGHT, 30s, looks over at Kumail. 
DR. WRIGHT May I speak with you for a second? 
KUMAIL (to Emily) I'll be right back. 
INT. ICU ROOM HALLWAY- CONTINUOUS 
Kumail follows Dr. Wright out to a busy hallway. 
DR. WRIGHT There is a massive infection in her lungs. All her vitals are elevated. Does she have HIV? 
KUMAIL What? No. I mean she-- 
DR. WRIGHT Are you her husband? 
KUMAIL No-- 
DR. WRIGHT We need to intubate her immediately. I need a family member to sign this. So I'm going to ask you again. Are you her husband? 
KUMAIL What does "intubate" mean? 
DR. WRIGHT We have to put her on a respirator and to do that we need to put her in a medically induced coma. 
KUMAIL Coma. 
DR. WRIGHT Yes, to stabilize her so we can work on the infection. And it needs to happen right now. So, I'm going to ask you one last time, are you her husband? 
Kumail signs the forms. 
INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER 
Dr. Wright and Orderlies rush Emily down the hallway on a GURNEY. Kumail runs with them. Trying to keep up. 
EMILY What's going on?! Where are you taking me? 
CUT TO: 
DR. SPELLMAN Our theory is methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. 
TERRY (taking NOTES) Hold on. Is staphylococcus with an "f" or a "ph"? 
DR. SPELLMAN Ph. 
MONTAGE of doctors babbling unintelligibly as Beth and Terry visibly panic. 
INT. WAITING ROOM- MOMENTS LATER 
Terry, Beth, and Kumail sit, surrounded by: KIDS WITH COLORING BOOKS, ADULTS WITH MAGAZINES, various CHARGERS plugged into the wall. These are the PEOPLE WHO WAIT. 
KUMAIL That was very reassuring, wasn't it? Apparently, there are good and bad comas. And the kind that they put her in, the medically induced ones, are definitely the good kind of coma. (MORE) 
KUMAIL (CONT'D) Like you know how there are good and bad carbs. Gremlins, those can be good or bad. 
TERRY Listen, Kumail... We're gonna handle things from here. You've been very helpful. Thank you. For signing the thing- 
KUMAIL My pleasure 
TERRY But you can go now. 
KUMAIL Oh... okay... all right. Peace in the Mideast. 
He picks up his backpack and exits. 
INT. TRIPLE DOOR - BACKSTAGE - THAT NIGHT 
Kumail, Mary, Chris, CJ, & Sam sit with notebooks open. 
CHRIS What about this? I saw a sniffer dog at the airport get a boner. Does that mean drugs or bombs? 
CJ That's good. What if instead of it being at the airport, you quit comedy and never did comedy ever again? 
CHRIS Fuck you. It's a good bit. 
CJ Just for the sake of the public. So they wouldn't have to look at your face or hear your words. 
Kumail interjects. 
KUMAIL It's okay that I'm not there, right? Like, I don't need to be there, right? 
SAM What happened? 
CHRIS He put his girlfriend in a coma. You know, the way you do. 
MARY He signed a paper that allowed doctors to put her-- 
CJ He suggested it. 
KUMAIL She's gonna be fine. She's gonna be fine. They said she's gonna be fine. Doctors know medical stuff. That's what doctors do. They're good at medical stuff. This is a medically induced coma. This is their specialty. 
MARY Maybe. 
CHRIS It might be a good thing. She might wake up with a new skill. Like my cousin blacked out once and when he came to, he thought he knew a different language. 
CJ Did he? 
CHRIS No, it was just gibberish that he made up. It was brain damage. 
CJ and Mary shake their heads. Kumail looks freaked out. 
SAM I got another Taco Bell one... 
INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM- MONDAY MORNING 
Terry and Beth wait. Beth is sewing a shirt of Emily's. Terry is pacing. Kumail walks up to them. 
BETH Did you forget something? 
KUMAIL Is she up yet? 
TERRY No, she's not. They won't tell us anything. We've been here all morning. 
KUMAIL I know you guys said you don't need me to stay, but I think I'm just going to wait anyway. 
BETH You guys broke up. I'm not sure why you're here. You don't have to worry about being committed to anything, Kumail. You didn't want to when she was awake. There's no need to do it when she's unconscious. 
DR. CUNNINGHAM On the lung. 
BETH What's the risk? 
DR. CUNNINGHAM Low. My advice to you is that you go home, you get something to eat, and try to relax. 
INT. KUMAIL'S CAR - NIGHT 
Kumail drives Beth and Terry. Everyone looks dazed. 
EXT. EMILY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - LATER 
Kumail helps Beth and Terry carry their luggage upstairs. 
INT. EMILY'S APARTMENT- CONTINUOUS 
They enter. Beth and Terry begin looking around. 
TERRY She left the lights on, eh? 
BETH My favorite sweater. 
Terry looks at Emily's bookshelf and pulls out a BOOK. Beth puts the sweater on and takes her laptop out, sits on the couch. 
BETH (CONT'D) I'm gonna do some research. 
TERRY Oh hey, that's the book I gave her. 
BETH No, I gave her that one. Hey, do you have that little notebook from the doctors? 
Terry hands her the notebook. 
TERRY No, this is the book I gave her. 
KUMAIL I'm just gonna clean up Emily's rooms real quick. 
BETH I remember. I met her at the falafel place and then we went to that book store that's hardly ever open and I bought it for her. 
TERRY You're not the only one who gives her things. 
BETH What's up with you? 
TERRY I'm just tired of you thinking that you're the only one who gives her things. I gave her that book. 
BETH Look at the inscription. 
TERRY No. That's stupid. 
Beth shrugs and goes back to the computer. Terry looks at the inscription, frowns, puts it back. 
INT. EMILY'S BEDROOM- SAME 
Kumail leaves the door open a crack. He sees in the LIVING ROOM Terry and Beth are whisper-quarrelling. 
He begins to clean. Pulls a MARIJUANA PIPE and BAG OF WEED off the dresser and shoves it into the back of her closet. 
He notices the BRAINS SHIRT in the closet. He touches it. We see a flashback of Emily wearing the sweatshirt. 
He opens a cigar box on her dresser and pulls out POLAROID pictures. They're of him and Emily. More flashbacks of Emily. 
TERRY (O.S.) Kumail. 
Kumail, a bit startled, turns. 
KUMAIL Hey. 
TERRY Sorry... Didn't mean to surprise you. I was just wondering if we wanna do anything. Got any parlor games... 
KUMAIL I don't-what are parlor games? 
TERRY Card games, word games. You play any word games? 
KUMAIL No, I've never played- 
TERRY You ever played You Can't Rhyme It? 
KUMAIL How does that go? 
TERRY It's basically where you try to find a word, a real word, that nobody can rhyme. 
Kumail, Terry and Beth are eating pizza. 
BETH So is it always like that? 
KUMAIL Oh like tonight? No, usually a different mom comes in to help me. I'm joking. No, it's not always like that. I'd quit if it was. 
TERRY Here's a joke. 
BETH No, Terry, don't. Terry's about as funny as a fart at a funeral. 
TERRY This is funny, this is a funny one. A giraffe walks into a bar and he says to the bartender, "Highballs on me." You get it, right? 
KUMAIL Oh that was the end of the joke? 
TERRY Yes. 
KUMAIL That was the whole joke? 
TERRY That's the joke. That's the beauty of it, boom. 
KUMAIL I thought there was more. 
TERRY He's a giraffe, he's tall, so it would stand to reason his testicles are high and a highball is a type of drink, and you ruined it by saying I wasn't funny first. 
He gives up and eats. Kumail chuckles. 
KUMAIL No, it's good. I like my jokes thoroughly explained. 
TERRY You're just busting my high balls. 
Kumail laughs. 
INT. EMILY'S KITCHEN TABLE - LATER 
Terry swills WINE and swishes some in his mouth. 
TERRY Complex finish. Flamboyant mouth-feel. Good. How about you? 
KUMAIL Hmm, fruit-forward. 
TERRY Good term. Absolutely fruit-forward. 
KUMAIL This one is in the front seat. It's driving the wine car. 
TERRY Exactly. 
BETH I like wine cause of the buzz. 
TERRY She's a bit of a lightweight. 
BETH So is Terry! He'll be passed out on the sofa in less than an hour! 
TERRY Ah that's nonsense. You know that's not true. 
INT. EMILY'S LIVING ROOM- LATER 
Terry, passed out on the sofa snoring. Kumail & Beth sit. 
BETH You weren't supposed to be on the show tonight, were you? 
KUMAIL Oh? Me on the show tonight? Yeah, yeah I was. I was the headliner. 
Beth stares him down. 
KUMAIL (CONT'D) Okay. I lied about the show to get out of hanging out with you guys. And then I lied about headlining to impress you guys. 
BETH Well that didn't work. 
KUMAIL Also, I think I screwed up with your daughter. 
BETH Yeah, you did. (then) I don't know how people do it when their family's sick. My Uncle Lew, he got cancer, then he had a stroke, then a heart attack, then he had a recurrence of the cancer. But you know what killed him? 
KUMAIL Cancer? 
BETH Car accident. We think maybe it was a heart attack while he was driving. And he did still have cancer too. And you know what? He ate sprouts his whole fucking life. Hadn't had a yolk in 30 years. I don't know how I'm going to sleep tonight. 
KUMAIL You wanna stress eat? 
BETH Fuck yeah. 
DR. SPELLMAN She should be up by tomorrow morning at the latest. We'll also test the pleural fluid from the thoracentesis so we can create a more targeted antibiotic strategy. 
BETH So this is good news? 
DR. SPELLMAN It's very good news. We'll just hold onto her for a few more days and then you can have her back. 
TERRY She's a fighter, right? 
DR. SPELLMAN Yes. 
INT. KUMAIL'S PARENTS DINING ROOM - NIGHT 
Kumail eating with his family. 
SHARMEEN I was so worried. We saw on the news that a train derailed and we thought that you were on the train and you had died. 
KUMAIL Nobody died on that train, Ma. 
SHARMEEN But did they look under the train? 
AZMAT So, where were you last night? What were you doing? 
KUMAIL Nothing. I wasn't doing anything. 
SHARMEEN Kumail. 
KUMAIL Alright, I'll tell you. I was... studying for the LSAT. 
SHARMEEN Really? 
KUMAIL Yup. I signed up. And if I pass, I'm gonna go to law school, become a lawyer, and do law. 
The doorbell rings. Sharmeen gets up. 
SHARMEEN Oh, let me see who that could be. 
She exits. 
KUMAIL Really, Dad? You said that nobody was gonna come. That it was gonna be just us. 
NAVEED Hey Kumi, do you know this guy? People say Sam. People say Sam. Do you know him? 
KUMAIL Yeah, I know. 
FATIMA He should be on Saturday Night Live. 
NAVEED SNL. 
Sharmeen returns with Khadija. 
SHARMEEN Everybody remember Khadija? She just dropped in. She was just in the neighborhood. 
Khadija waves awkwardly, and her parents, FARHAN and TINA appear. 
SHARMEEN (CONT'D) And these are her parents, Farhan and Tina. They also just dropped in. 
INT. KUMAIL'S PARENT'S HOUSE - LATER 
Tina holds forth in Urdu. The grown-ups laugh. Khadija tries to lock eyes with Kumail. 
EXT. KHADIJA'S HOUSE - LATER 
Kumail walks Khadija to her door. 
KHADIJA I've just been through so many of these appointments and I never have anything in common with the guys. You know when girls at work complain about dating, I just want to body slam them. They have no idea. I don't know. My mom says I'm becoming the bruised apple at the bottom of the apple bucket. 
KUMAIL No, no. You're not. 
KHADIJA I am. 
KUMAIL You're not. 
KHADIJA So do you want to hangout sometime? Like without our parents? Have you been to the cat cafe? The cats just come up to you and nestle in your lap and you just pet them. 
KUMAIL I don't think that's a good idea. 
KHADIJA You don't like cats? 
KUMAIL I mean I don't think it's a good idea for us to hangout again. It's not you. You're fantastic. I just can't do this arranged marriage thing -- with anybody. 
TERRY Will you just stop for a second? They're the doctors. You act like you know what you're talking about. You don't. 
Beth searches in her bag. 
BETH I can't find my cellphone. You got a phone? 
TERRY Don't give her a phone. You don't need a phone. You don't need to call anybody right now. 
Kumail takes out his phone, hands it to Beth. She starts fiddling with it. 
TERRY (CONT'D) They're doing it. They're the experts here, and I trust them. 
BETH Well that's very nice. But I don't. Can you unlock that thing? 
Beth hands the phone back to Kumail, he unlocks it, hands it back. 
BETH (CONT'D) There's a reason why they're #17 and Northwestern's #1. And it's not because people trust them! 
TERRY Oh - you think that you're smarter than me because you say big sentences. Well you're not! 
Kumail is trying to give them space, unsure what to do. 
BETH I don't think I'm smarter than you! You just don't think you're as smart as I am! That's not my fault! 
TERRY Right. It's never your fault. Everything's my fault. 
BETH Oh there are some things that are definitely just your fault. 
TERRY Okay, that's bullshit. You need to stop freaking out and calm down. 
BETH And you need to stop being a coward. 
TERRY Greatest hits, coming back. You can stop, I'll replay the rest of this from memory. 
Kumail slips away. 
INT. GIFT SHOP - MOMENTS LATER 
Kumail looking at gift items. 
INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - LATER 
Kumail walks with a giant STUFFED GIRAFFE. 
INT. EMILY'S ICU ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Kumail puts the STUFFED GIRAFFE by her bed. Nurse Judy smiles. 
NURSE JUDY Oh, you're giraffe-ing it. 
KUMAIL It was the biggest thing they had. I don't even know if she likes giraffes. We never talked about giraffes. Hey, do they know what they're doing? Cause they don't tell us anything. Like, Lyme Disease? You know the girl on The Real World had it? Did you guys look for that? 
NURSE JUDY Yes, we did. 
KUMAIL Did you know she gets hurt all the time? She messed up her ankle recently - could that be Lupus? 
NURSE JUDY Kumail. We're looking into everything. We're not holding anything back from you. We're still just eliminating possibilities. 
KUMAIL Cause Beth wants to move her to Northwestern. 
NURSE JUDY Oh no. Emily should not be moved. The hospital will approve it because it'll get the liability off their hands, but we put her in a coma for a reason. To stabilize her. Moving her could be very dangerous. The infection could spread. Trust me she is fighting. And so are we. 
Kumail looks frightened. 
INT. WAITING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Terry balls up his coat to use as a pillow, trying to get comfortable. Kumail enters. TERRY sees him and sits up. 
KUMAIL Hey Terry. I was just talking to the nurse - You okay? 
TERRY Yeah, of course. Totally fine. 
Terry's eyes are very puffy and red. 
TERRY (CONT'D) Beth went to Emily's, so I'm gonna wait here until they kick me out. Keep an eye on her. 
Long pause. Terry and Kumail staring at one another. 
KUMAIL Do you wanna crash at my place? 
TERRY Out loud it sounds stupid. Yeah, that's terrible advice. 
Terry is clearly fraught. 
TERRY (CONT'D) Love isn't easy. That's why they call it love. 
KUMAIL I don't really get that either. 
TERRY I know. I thought I could just start saying something and something smart would come out. 
INT. KUMAIL'S BEDROOM - MORNING 
Kumail wakes up. Terry is gone. There is a note. "Headed to the hospital. See you there - Terry." 
INT. KUMAIL'S APARTMENT 
Kumail pulls on his shoes as Chris exits the bathroom. 
KUMAIL Hey did you see Terry? 
CHRIS No, I heard him leave this morning. I'm going to Sevies. You want anything? 
KUMAIL No, I'm good, thank you. 
CHRIS You don't want a hot dog or nothing? 
KUMAIL Dude it's 8:30 in the morning. 
CHRIS Okay, no hot dog. 
Chris opens the door to leave as Azmat and Sharmeen enter. 
SHARMEEN We just spoke to Khadija's parents. 
KUMAIL What are you doing here? 
SHARMEEN What is wrong with you, Kumi? 
KUMAIL Nothing is wrong with me. I'm sorry- 
SHARMEEN Sorry? That's all you have to say? 
KUMAIL I wasn't that into her. 
SHARMEEN "Into her"? Do you know how difficult it is to get an appointment with her? She is in very high demand. 
KUMAIL Okay. So? 
SHARMEEN So? 
KUMAIL Can we please talk about this another time? 
SHARMEEN No, no, Kumi. We will talk about this now. We have sacrificed everything for you. 
KUMAIL I know, okay? 
SHARMEEN We have left our family. We have left our home. I have missed the birth of my sister's daughter. I have not seen my mother for fifteen years. Your father, he had to do his graduate school. Again. He had to give exams. Again. 
AZMAT I was in my mid 50's. They were in 20s. They used to call me Father Time! 
KUMAIL I know that. I really appreciate everything you did for me, but can we talk about this another time? 
SHARMEEN Kumi, if you don't want to be a lawyer, fine. If you want to do the stand-up comedy and embarrass us as a family, fine. There is only one thing that we have ever asked from you: that you be a good Muslim and that you marry a Pakistani girl. That is it, one thing! 
KUMAIL Can I ask you something that has never made sense to me? Why did you bring me here if you wanted me to not have an American life? (MORE) 
KUMAIL (CONT'D) We come here but we pretend like we're still back there? That's so stupid! 
AZMAT Don't you talk to your mother like that! 
KUMAIL You don't care what I think. You just want me to follow the rules. But the rules don't make sense to me. I don't pray. I don't. I haven't prayed in years. I just go down there and I play video games. 
AZMAT You don't believe in Allah? 
KUMAIL I don't know what I believe, Dad! I don't know. And I can't marry someone you find for me. 
SHARMEEN And why not? 
KUMAIL Because I'm in love with someone. I am. Her name is Emily and she's gonna be a therapist. And right now she's very sick but I couldn't tell you that. It makes me so sad that I couldn't tell you any of that. I really appreciate everything you've done for me. I truly, truly do. And I know Islam has been really good for you, it has made you good people, but I don't know what I believe. I just need to figure it out on my own. 
KUMAIL What the fuck, you fucking idiot? 
Kumail gets out of the car, runs to the pick up window. 
KUMAIL (CONT'D) Hey, look at me. Cause I'm a human being. You're a human being. Look at me. Look me in the eyes when you fuck me! Look at me. PLEASE! 
STU Today's my first day. 
KUMAIL Fuck you! 
Kumail turns to the garbage can nearby and just starts pulling garbage out. He locks eyes with Stu. 
STU I'll just ring you up for four burgers. 
STU looks down and starts typing. 
KUMAIL I'm sorry. 
STU (un-emotional) Do you want any fries or drink with that? 
KUMAIL I'll take four fries. I'm sorry. 
Kumail begins to put the trash back in the trash can. 
INT. KUMAIL'S CAR - NIGHT 
Parked, Kumail sits scarfing down burgers and fries. He gets a text from Chris: "Where are you? You're up in 
KUMAIL Fuck! 
INT. TRIPLE DOOR - SHOWROOM 
Kumail enters. Big crowd. Mary's on stage. Chris runs up. 
CHRIS Hey man, Montreal finals. You ready? Oh wait, are you getting all dark and moody before your set? Yeah, punish yourself like a nasty little baby. 
KUMAIL I am not in the mood. Okay Chris? 
CHRIS I'll get you in the mood. 
Kumail walks towards CJ and Sam. 
CHRIS (CONT'D) (to everyone) I'll get you all in the mood. 
CJ You all right? 
KUMAIL Why does everybody say the same fucking thing? Yeah, I'm doing great. 
CJ Okay, all right dude. I'm just checking. 
Dodd runs up to Kumail. 
DODD The fuck've you been, man? You're on next! 
Dodd runs off. On stage, Mary is doing well. Kumail's phone rings. It's Terry. Kumail hesitates. Then answers. We see Kumail's face. He doesn't say anything. On stage - Mary finishes her act. We hear Terry's voice on the call. 
TERRY (O.S.) Kumail, it's Terry. Listen, we're not moving here. The doctors, they said.. 
We don't hear the rest of the call. 
DODD This next performer, my man, Mr. Kumail Nanjiani! 
Kumail is dazed. We see Bob Dalavan in the audience. 
INT. TRIPLE DOOR - CONTINUOUS 
Kumail slowly walks up to the stage. He stands there silently, looking at the audience. Then, finally... 
KUMAIL Have you guys heard of this new drug cocktail called cheese? Like that's the name of it, it's called cheese. I saw all these news reports, and they were like, there's a new drug, it's called cheese. Everyone's doing it in the Midwest, kids are doing it. 
Titters. Barely anything. Bob Dalavan not laughing. 
KUMAIL (CONT'D) It's just really hard to do stand-up comedy when your girlfriend is in a coma. 
The audience laughs nervously. 
KUMAIL (CONT'D) Not quite sure what part you're laughing at. They say she's fighting, but she doesn't look like she's fighting. She looks like she's just laying there. I said horrible things to her. I hurt her. She loves birds. Like she gets excited every time she sees a bird. She's like, look at this, it's a bird. And I'm always like, yeah, they're all over the place, they're birds. But she likes that bird. Every bird she sees, she sees it. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. HALLWAY - SAME 
Cunningham speaks with Terry and Beth. 
DR. CUNNINGHAM Emily has a rare condition called Adult Onset Still's disease. Kumail mentioned Emily's hurt ankle and the swelling still hadn't gone down even after several days in bed, which is strange. Still's disease is when the body thinks healthy tissue is an infection so it tries to fight it. It's like a big biological misunderstanding. 
TERRY Yeah, yeah. 
DR CUNNINGHAM We gave her anti-inflammatories and she stabilized within hours. She's gonna take time to recover but she'll be fine. 
TERRY Wow. 
INT. EMILY'S ICU ROOM - SAME 
Kumail speaks with Emily. 
EMILY What are you doing here? 
KUMAIL I was visiting someone down the hall and I was like, I'll just pop in and say hi to Emily. 
EMILY Oh. 
KUMAIL No, I'm joking, I was here for you. 
EMILY You're an asshole and I don't like you. 
KUMAIL I'm not an asshole. I'm really not. 
EMILY No, you're an asshole. 
KUMAIL You have a lot of drugs in you so you're not thinking as clearly. 
EMILY Naw dog. I'm not joking. You're not funny to me. You just make me sad. You make me sad inside of my heart, and it makes me sad to look at you. So I think you should probably go. Just go and tell my mom I want her. 
Kumail doesn't know what to say. 
EMILY (CONT'D) Will you please get my mom? 
Kumail nods and heads out to the hallway. 
INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 
Kumail goes up to Beth and Terry. 
KUMAIL Emily wants to see you. 
Beth goes back inside Emily's room. 
KUMAIL (CONT'D) I'm gonna head out. I don't think I should be here. 
TERRY Alright, Kumail. Here's the thing. Your living condition is a potential health risk and you're not that funny. But.... you're probably not suited to do anything else either so that's troublesome-- 
KUMAIL You really made it sound like you were going to say something positive there. 
TERRY I guess I did, didn't I? You know I know the good stuff. You know how I feel. I gotta get in there. 
Terry heads back inside. 
INT. EMILY'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Terry walks in. Beth sits on Emily's bed as Kumail watches through the window. Beth notices Kumail. 
EXT. EMILY'S HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 
Beth comes outside into the hallway. 
KUMAIL So you gonna hang around Chicago for a while? 
BETH Yeah. She's got physical therapy. 
KUMAIL Did you ever think you'd be excited to have your daughter go through physical therapy? (beat) It's so strange that we could go through one of the most intense experiences of our lives together and just never see each other again. 
Beth puts her hands on Kumail's face. She looks at him. 
BETH Maybe. But I hope not. 
They smile. Kumail walks out of the hospital. 
INT. COMEDY CLUB - A DIFFERENT NIGHT 
He holds up a JAR FULL OF ASHES. 
EMILY What did you do? Did you cremate someone? 
KUMAIL These are the ashes of all the Pakistani women - not the women - the pictures of the Pakistani women. I thought this was a good idea, but it feels a little stupid. 
Kumail puts the items down and kneels before Emily. 
KUMAIL (CONT'D) I know I was a terrible boyfriend. But I've changed. And I am the person you need me to be. I really am. So, will you take me back? 
EMILY Kumail, I'm really glad that you went through this experience, but you have to understand that all that happened while I was asleep. Like you felt one way a few weeks ago and now you're saying you feel the total opposite way and the only thing that's changed is that I was in a coma. Honestly, I look at all of this, and I just think, I can't do it again. I can't be the reason that you don't have a family. It just feels totally different now. And I can't do that again. Do you understand? 
KUMAIL Okay. 
Kumail packs up his bag of devotion.

INT. KUMAIL'S PARENT'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Kumail enters the dining room without knocking on the door. Azmat, Sharmeen, Naveed, and Fatima are eating dinner. Kumail joins them. We see he has another LARGE BAG. 
KUMAIL Ma. Dad. Fatima. Bhai. There's no plate. Oh I forgot. I've decided I won't let you kick me out of the family. Since I am a member of the family, it would stand to reason that I would get a vote in whether or not I get kicked out, and that vote would have to be unanimous. Standard parliamentary procedure. So all those in favor of not kicking Kumail out of the family, raise your hand. 
Kumail raises his hand. Everyone else stares silently. 
KUMAIL (CONT'D) Great. Motion to kick Kumail out of the family, denied. So you guys can just talk to me. 
Everyone is silent. 
KUMAIL (CONT'D) Okay, you're giving me the silent treatment. I figured that was what was going to happen. I have a solution. 
Kumail pulls out cue cards from his bag and shows them. 
KUMAIL (CONT'D) "Hi. How are you?" It's just a real basic one. "Pass the salt." Practical. "Always with the comedy." Mom, made that one specially for you. "Kumail, how did you become so much more handsome than your brother Naveed?" 
NAVEED Bullshit. 
Naveed and Azmat exchange a look. 
KUMAIL I admit this one is designed to stir up some controversy. "It's interesting how you can't really kick someone out of your family because they'll always be your family." I agree with that one. It's a good one. So, I'm gonna leave these here for you. 
Kumail leaves the cards on the dining table. 
KUMAIL (CONT'D) I'm sorry I lied about the girls and the LSAT and all of that. That was wrong. And one more thing: I'm moving to New York to pursue stand-up, but I am not leaving this family. 
Kumail leaves. Eye contact around the table. 
INT. EMILY'S APARTMENT- NIGHT 
Emily on her bed. She impulsively Googles Kumail and finds his MONTREAL AUDITION, which is described as "WORST BOMB IN HISTORY!!!" She plugs her headphones in and watches a beat. 
KUMAIL (V.O.) My parents want me to get arrange married. Or as it's called in Pakistan, romance! Earlier today, I told them everything. I told them about my life. I told them about Emily. They kicked me out of the family. I may never talk to them again. So that happened - 
KNOCK on the door. 
EMILY What is it? 
BETH (O.S.) Can I come in? 
EMILY I was in the neighborhood and I saw that you were gonna be here so I thought I'd come say hi. 
KUMAIL You look great. How's your blood oxygen level? 
EMILY Oh, well within range. 
KUMAIL Nice. 
They stand there. It's tense. 
KUMAIL (CONT'D) Uh, this is my brother, Naveed. 
EMILY Hi, I'm Emily. 
NAVEED I've heard lots about you. 
EMILY It's so good to finally meet you. (to Kumail) There's actually something I wanted to tell you. 
Naveed clocks the tension between them. 
NAVEED Okay, well I'm going to just... goodbye. 
Naveed slips out as Emily and Kumail stare at each other. 
INT. EMILY'S APARTMENT - SAME 
Terry lies on the pull out sofa. Just before Beth gets to Emily's room she stops. 
BETH Are you warm enough? 
TERRY Yeah, yeah. I've got my two pairs of socks on. 
She smiles, walks into Emily's bedroom. Terry gets under the covers. Beth reemerges and approaches his couch-bed. 
BETH Do you mind? 
TERRY No... no... 
Beth gets under the covers with him. They snuggle. 
BETH I'm glad we're going home tomorrow. 
TERRY Me too. See? I should have brushed my teeth. 
BETH I like it. 
INT. PLAYGROUND THEATRE - LATER 
Kumail and Emily sit on the bed from his show together. 
EMILY When something like this happens, there's this sort of expectation that you're going to have this completely new lease on life and feel totally different about everything. Like cherish every sunrise. And for the most part I just feel like, ugh I can't get up that early. I'm sorry, I feel like I've been talking about myself so much. Are you doing a lot of stand-up? 
KUMAIL Yeah, I bombed my Montreal Comedy Festival audition, like horrifically. 
EMILY I saw the video. It wasn't great. I'll be honest with you, it wasn't great. 
KUMAIL I know. 
EMILY But there was a lot I liked. Like a lot I liked. 
KUMAIL I'm moving to New York. 
EMILY Really? 
KUMAIL Yeah. Mary and CJ and I are just gonna drive out. We have a place already. 
EMILY When do you leave? 
KUMAIL Next weekend. 
This kinda hits them both like a ton of bricks. 
EMILY I'm so excited for you. That is great. I think you are going to do so great in New York. 
KUMAIL What were you going to say? 
EMILY What? 
KUMAIL You said you were going to say something to me. What was it?

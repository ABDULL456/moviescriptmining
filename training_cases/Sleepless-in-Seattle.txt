wears a hat so he won't catch a 
cold, and I'm going to marry 
him and have three children 
and live happily ever after. 
I mean, I am not cut out for this 
DIANE 
For what? 
ANNIE 
For life as we know it. 
LAURIE 
Just make sure he isn't fat 
like my Michael or you'll spend 
your whole life worrying he's 
going to drop dead. 
JUDITH 
God, you guys are so romantic. 
ANNIE 
Do you know how long romance 
lasts? 
(she snaps her fingers) 
That long. 
DIANE 
Steven still brings me flowers 
every Friday and we've been 
married 10 years. 
LAURIE 
(to Diane) 
Honey, nobody wants to hear 
that. 
(to Annie) 
Here, darling, have some Tic 
Tacs. 
Kissing everyone.  Annie starts toward the plane, loaded 
with stuff. 
ANNIE 
The next time you see me I am 
going to be incredibly happy. 
INT. PLANE - NIGHT 
Sam and Jonah sitting together as the plane waits on the 
runway.  He notices his father's distractedness, reaches 
over and takes his hand.  Sam comes back into focus. 
SAM 
I'm your dad.  Don't ever 
forget that.  That's rule 
number two. 
(beat) 
It's you and me, kid. 
INT. PLANE - NIGHT 
Annie sitting by herself as the plane waits on the 
runway. 
ANNIE 
(to herself) 
I guess it's just us. 
She gulps. 
EXT. O'HARA AIRPORT - NIGHT 
The two planes face in opposite directions, waiting for 
instructions. 
And now they both start to take off.  In opposite 
directions. 
And we pull back back back back as the planes take off, 
one flying east, the other flying west. 
And further and further back as they soar into the air 
and leave the frame. 
The night sky. 
Stars twinkle. 
And now tilt down to see the United States.  It looks 
like a cross between a satellite photo and a drawing by 
Saul Steinberg. 
A light goes on in Baltimore. 
A light goes on in Seattle. 
They are the only lights on the map. 
EXT. BALTIMORE SUN BUILDING - LATE AFTERNOON - CHRISTMAS EVE 
As Annie comes out of the newspaper building with WALTER 
JACKSON, a tall, handsome man who wears a hat.  They're 
carrying an armful of Christmas presents.  They're 
walking toward the parking lot. 
WALTER 
The short one with black hair 
is your cousin Irene -- 
ANNIE 
-- who's married to -- 
WALTER 
Harold, who ran away with his 
secretary but came back -- 
ANNIE 
-- because Irene threatened to 
put the dog to sleep if he 
didn't -- 
WALTER 
And your brother Tom is a 
psychology professor and is 
married to...Betsy -- 
ANNIE 
-- who is the most competitive 
woman in the world -- 
They put the presents in the backs of their two cars and 
pull out together. 
EXT. A HOUSE IN BALTIMORE SUBURBS - NIGHT 
Christmas lights twinkling as the two cars pull up in 
front of a comfortable upper middle-class house and park 
their cars.  They get out assembling presents. 
WALTER 
Your Uncle Milton lost all his 
money in a Puerto Rican 
condominium that went belly up, 
don't mention the IRS or the 
Federal prison system.  Your 
mother is Barbara, your father 
is Cliff -- 
ANNIE 
I hope he doesn't get out his 
slides. 
WALTER 
Am I what they had in mind? 
ANNIE 
They're going to love you. 
WALTER 
(to Lou Gehrig line) 
Today I consider myself the 
luckiest man on the face of 
the earth. 
IRENE 
What are you wearing? 
ANNIE 
I don't know. 
BETSY 
I wish you would wear my dress. 
I only wore it once, and you'll 
barely have to do anything to 
it except take it in in the 
bust -- 
BARBARA 
I have something that might do 
INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER 
Walter is sitting on the couch as Cliff shows him slides 
of cloud formations in Guatemala.  In the next room 
Tom's at the piano and the kids are singing Christmas 
carols. 
INT. BACK STAIRWAY - SIMULTANEOUS 
MAX, one of the children, is teaching Uncle Milton to 
burp. 
INT. ATTIC - NIGHT 
The sound of Christmas carols from below. 
The attic is full of boxes and Annie walks through with 
her mother.  They come to a dressmakers dummy with a 
sheet over it.  Barbara removes the sheet.  A beautiful 
antique dress.  A veil sitting on top of the dummy. 
BARBARA 
The Historical Society wanted 
this and I never would give it 
to them -- 
ANNIE 
Granny's dress.  Oh, Mom. 
BARBARA 
I notice these things are back 
in fashion.  Oh, honey. 
(tears are rolling down 
her face as she tries 
the veil on Annie) 
He's a lovely man, Annie. 
ANNIE 
I know.  He's wonderful, isn't 
he? 
BARBARA 
Are his folks nice? 
ANNIE 
You'll love them.  We're going 
down to D.C.  tonight to be with 
them Christmas morning. 
BARBARA 
How did it happen? 
Barbara starts to unbutton the tiny buttons on the back 
of the dress and remove it from the dummy. 
ANNIE 
It's silly, really.  I mean, 
I'd seen him at the office, 
obviously I'd seen him, he's 
the associate publisher, and 
then one day we both ordered 
sandwiches from the same place, 
and he got my lettuce and 
tomato sandwich on whole wheat, 
which of course he was allergic 
to, and I got his lettuce and 
tomato on white. 
BARBARA 
(utterly without irony) 
How amazing. 
ANNIE 
It is, isn't it? You make 
millions of decisions that mean 
nothing and then one day you 
decide to order takeout and it 
changes your life. 
BARBARA 
Destiny takes a hand. 
ANNIE 
Oh, please.  Destiny's just 
something we've invented 
because we can't stand the fact 
that everything that happens is 
accidental. 
BARBARA 
Then how do you explain that 
you both ordered exactly the 
same sandwich except for the 
bread? How many people in this 
world like lettuce and tomato 
without something else like 
tuna? 
ANNIE 
It wasn't a sign.  It was a 
coincidence. 
Barbara shrugs, slips the dress off the dummy and Annie 
steps into it. 
Barbra starts to button the dress on Annie. 
BARBARA 
I was in Atlantic City with my 
family.  Cliff was a waiter. 
He talked me into sneaking out 
for a midnight walk on the 
Steel Pier.  I've probably told 
you this a million times, but 
I don't care.  And then he held 
my hand.  I was scared.  All 
sorts of thing were going 
through my head.  But after a 
while I forgot about them.  At 
one point I looked down, at our 
hands, and I couldn't tell 
which fingers were mine and 
which were his.  And I knew. 
you can give yourself is a call 
to me.  The number is -- 
ANNIE 
Give me a break. 
Annie changes the station. 
RADIO VOICE 
The subject of the evening's 
medical update is You and Your 
Spleen and our host -- 
She flips the dial back the other way. 
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) 
Our caller is from Seattle. 
Annie changes the station. 
RADIO VOICE 
Coming up, Jingle Bells 
backwards, sung by the New 
Jersey Cape Mayettes -- 
Annie twists the dial back the other way.  We hear a 
YOUNG BOY's voice. 
BOY'S VOICE (V.O.) 
Hello, this is Jonah -- 
(there's a bleep as 
Jonah says his last 
name) 
Annie's hand lingers on the dial. 
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) 
No last names, Jonah.  Hello 
there, you sound younger than 
our usual callers.  How come 
you're up so late? 
JONAH (V.O.) 
It's not that late in Seattle. 
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) 
Got me there.  What's your 
Christmas wish, Jonah? 
JONAH (V.O.) 
It's not for me.  It's for my 
dad.  I think he needs a new 
wife. 
Annie shakes her head. 
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) 
You don't like the one he was 
now? 
JONAH (V.O.) 
He doesn't have one now. 
That's the problem. 
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) 
Where's your mom? 
JONAH (V.O.) 
She died. 
Annie closes her eyes for a moment. 
ANNIE 
I don't believe this -- 
EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT 
As the car drives along. 
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) 
I'm sorry to hear that, Jonah. 
JONAH (V.O.) 
I've been pretty sad, but I 
think my dad is worse. 
INT. CAR - NIGHT 
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) 
And you're worried about him. 
JONAH (V.O.) 
I'm worried about him, he's 
worried about me, I ride my 
bike to school, he follows in 
the car, like I'm not supposed 
to know he's there.  Now it's 
Christmas, and you know what 
happens to people at Christmas. 
ANNIE 
They lose their minds and call 
crackpot doctors on the radio -- 
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) 
Have you talked to your dad 
about this? 
JONAH (V.O.) 
No. 
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) 
Why not? 
JONAH (V.O.) 
It's very hard for him to talk 
about this stuff.  It's like it 
makes him sadder. 
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) 
You want me to talk to him? 
ANNIE 
Perfect.  Sandbag the father. 
JONAH (V.O.) 
And you crazy? He thinks shows 
like this are dumb.  If you 
didn't have an 800 number I 
could never get away with this 
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) 
Is he home right now? 
JONAH (V.O.) 
Yeah. 
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) 
Well, I think I can help a 
little more if I talk to him 
directly. 
JONAH (V.O.) 
I don't know -- 
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) 
I'm sure he won't be angry once 
he realizes how concerned you 
are about him. 
JONAH (V.O.) 
Okay, but if I get yelled at, 
I'm never gonna listen to this 
show again. 
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) 
Fair enough. 
INT. SAM'S HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT 
Jonah is on the telephone on the first floor of the 
something must be missing if 
Jonah feels that you're still 
under a cloud. 
JONAH 
Tell her how you don't sleep at 
night. 
SAM 
How do you know that? 
Sam and Jonah both talk into their extensions, literally 
talking to each other on the phone within their own 
house, but also ON THE AIR. 
JONAH 
I can hear you walking around 
sometimes.  At first I thought 
it was a robber.  Go ahead, 
tell her, Dad. 
SAM 
I don't think I have to now. 
Sam starts across the room towards Jonah, who starts 
toward him, both of them holding their phone receivers. 
On the wall in the dining area is a pine bench. 
SAM 
Look, it's almost Christmas -- 
(as the two of them sit 
down together on the 
bench) 
A kid needs a mother -- 
He puts an arm around Jonah. 
INT. CAR - NIGHT 
As Annie listens.  She's softened considerably. 
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) 
Could it be that you need 
someone just as much as Jonah 
does? 
ANNIE 
Yes. 
Annie catches herself, covers her mouth in embarrassment. 
ANNIE 
I'm losing my mind. 
EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT 
As Annie makes a turn off the beltway into a rest stop. 
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) 
We've been talking to -- well, 
let's just call him Sleepless 
in Seattle, and we'll be right 
back after this break with 
listener response, your 
response, to the things we've 
been discussing.  The number to 
call is... 
INT. BALDWIN HOUSE 
SAM 
What's she talking about? 
JONAH 
This is where other people get 
to call in and dump on what you 
said. 
We hear the beginning of a commercial. 
INT. TRUCK STOP RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
Annie walks in, anxious to break the spell of her radio 
reverie.  She goes to the counter to order some coffee. 
There's a commercial on the radio.  The counter WAITRESS 
LORETTA is talking to the customers -- who include a 
TRUCK DRIVER at a booth.  HARRIET, a short-order-cook, 
is visible through an open window to the kitchen. 
LORETTA 
I'll bet he's tall, with a cute 
butt. 
HARRIET 
I'll bet he hasn't shaved in a 
week.  I'll bet he stinks. 
LORETTA 
Shut up, Harriet. 
(to Annie) 
What'll it be? 
ANNIE 
Coffee, please.  Black.  To go. 
LORETTA 
Maybe I should hustle myself 
out to Seattle.  Give him a 
little present for New Year's 
Eve. 
HARRIET 
You can go there if you want 
but don't open his refrigerator. 
They don't cover anything when 
they put it in the fridge. 
They just stick it in and leave 
it there till it walks out by 
itself. 
LORETTA 
Harriet, ever since you 
divorced your last husband, 
you've been no fun.  I'm 
looking, and this guy pops my 
tarts. 
TRUCK DRIVER 
Come on, Loretta, you're going 
to have to jump-start this guy. 
His battery's dead.  And look 
at me.  Mister Ever-Ready. 
Every six minutes, another 
charge. 
LORETTA 
I'm looking for someone 
sensitive. 
ANNIE 
Come on, nobody wants a guy 
who's sensitive on the radio. 
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) 
Let's take a call before we get 
back to Sleepless.  Knoxville, 
Tennessee, you're on. 
SWEET SOUTHERN VOICE 
Yes, I would just like to know 
where I could get this man's 
plaid shirt, his baseball glove, fishing rod -- as Sam 
takes his picture. 
INT. HOUSEBOAT - DAY (OR POSSIBLY EXT. DECK HOUSEBOAT) 
Sam opens his present from Jonah, which is something he 
made in woodworking class. 
SAM 
The hopes are perfect -- 
beautiful, identical, smooth -- 
and they are for something 
really amazing I feel it in my 
bones -- 
JONAH 
It's a spice rack. 
SAM 
We desperately need a spice 
rack.  Desperately. 
CUT TO: 
INT. KITCHEN OF HOUSEBOAT - DAY 
SAM 
And we desperately need spices. 
Where Sam is putting the spices they have -- pepper, 
salt, paprika and oregano -- into the spice rack, which 
has room for at least twenty more.  Jonah is 
methodically making pancakes. 
JONAH 
Dad?  About last night? 
SAM 
It's never happening again. 
Right? 
JONAH 
Right. 
There's a knock on the door. 
SAM 
Then it never happened. 
Sam goes to answer the door. 
TWO YOUNG WOMEN are standing there.  Both are wearing 
quite a lot of Spandex.  One of them is named LULU.  It 
says so on her jacket.  The other is JOBETH. 
SAM 
Hi. 
LULU 
Hi.  Sam? 
SAM 
Yes? 
LULU 
(looking in and seeing 
Jonah) 
You must be Jonah. 
Jonah nods. 
LULU 
(to her friend) 
See.  I told you.  Sam and 
Jonah.  I'm LULU.  This is 
JoBeth. 
JoBeth nods, and continues to nod as Lulu talks. 
LULU 
(continues) 
We live two piers over, don't 
we? Number 12, right? We're 
having like a really neat open 
house today from like four to 
whenever if you care to stop 
by. 
SAM 
Thanks, but... we've got plans. 
LULU 
Well, here's the number.  If 
you ever find yourself 
Sleepless, give us a call.  We 
also... do babysitting. 
She winks.  JoBeth nods. 
Sam nods. 
Lulu waves goodbye, and she and JoBeth sashay off down 
the dock. 
Jonah closes the door and turns to Sam. 
JONAH 
Not. 
SAM 
My feelings exactly. 
EXT. LAKE UNION MARINA - EARLY MORNING 
Jonah and Sam are fishing off a dingy. 
SAM 
How many people do you think 
heard that thing last night? 
JONAH 
It plays in 50 states. 
SAM 
What?! 
JONAH 
Nobody else is going to know it 
was us. 
SAM 
You're right. 
(after a beat) 
You better hope so. 
EXT. BALTIMORE SUN - MORNING 
INT. LIFESTYLE SECTION - DAY 
A large open newsroom-type space with REPORTERS at 
computers.  Around the perimeter are glass-partitioned 
offices and meeting rooms.  Inside one of the offices is 
BECKY, the Lifestyle editor of the Sun.  She's at a 
table with Annie, now a reporter for the section, and 
two other colleagues -- KEITH and WYATT.  Wyatt is 
playing Gameboy. 
KEITH 
This man sells the greatest 
soup you've ever eaten, there's 
a line around the block, and he 
is, I am not kidding, the meanest 
man in America. 
(beat) 
I feel strongly about this, 
Becky.  This is not just about 
soup. 
BECKY 
Do it.  What else? 
What was that about up there? 
ANNIE 
What was what? 
BECKY 
What's with you? 
ANNIE 
Nothing's with me. 
INT. BALTIMORE RESTAURANT - DAY 
Becky and Annie are having lunch. 
BECKY 
"Sleepless in Seattle"? 
ANNIE 
That's what she called him on 
the show.  Because he can't 
sleep. 
BECKY 
And now 2,000 women want his 
number.  The guy could be a 
crackhead, a psychopath, a 
flasher, a junkie, a 
transvestite, a chain-saw 
murderer, or someone really 
sick, like Rick. 
ANNIE 
Actually, he sounded nice. 
BECKY 
Oh? Oh, really? Now we're 
getting down to it. 
ANNIE 
Not. 
She reaches down for her purse. 
INT/EXT. REMODEL HOUSE - DAY 
A hand reaching down to pick something up -- the Seattle 
newspaper, and 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL: 
Sam carrying the paper down/up the stairs to an old 
house that's being renovated.  Jonah, who is playing 
Cameboy, is walking along with him.  WORKMEN are active 
everywhere.  Dry wall going up, cabinets being 
installed, tile being set. 
One of Sam's partners, BOB LANGMAN, is walking with him, 
and JAY MATHEWS, the on-site supervisor, is waiting for 
them in an unfinished doorframe.  Bob is hefty, older, 
always eating something dietetic.  Jay is younger and 
always wears as little as possible, even in cold weather. 
BOB LANGMAN 
Now she wants a circular 
stairwell off the den. 
JAY 
(to Jonah, in b.g.) 
Punch me, punch in right here. 
(points to his stomach; 
Jonah punches) 
And she wants the Sub-Zero with 
the side-by-side doors -- 
BOB 
Which means -- 
SAM 
The cabinets have to be redone 
They all nod at each other.  The woman has been a 
nightmare. 
BOB 
So we thought -- 
JAY 
Since you're on the make again 
Sam looks at Jonah -- 
SAM 
Great.  This is great.  The 
whole town knows.  Just out of 
curiosity, how do you two know? 
BOB 
Grace heard it. 
SAM 
Grace the dispatcher.  Great. 
BOB 
The point is, take the client 
out to dinner and ask her to 
marry you and then maybe we 
won't have to redo the kitchen 
cabinets. 
SAM 
Why me? What about Jay? 
JAY 
Hey, my plate is full. 
SAM 
Well, okay.  What's the big 
deal?  If she'll forget the 
new fireplace, I'll marry her. 
Just point me in the right 
direction. 
JONAH 
Dad, I don't know about this 
one -- 
SAM 
Oh, you're changing your mind 
JONAH 
No, I'm not, but -- 
SAM 
What's the matter with this 
one? Wouldn't you like to have 
Imelda Marcos as your mother? 
JONAH 
Dad -- 
Sam cuffs him good-naturedly. 
SAM 
We better take the measurements 
for the new cabinets. 
He walks away past some workmen, ladders, etc.  and 
starts checking the cross-beams in the ceiling over in 
another area of the site.  Bob follows after him.  Jay 
tosses Jonah a hammer and they start knocking nails into 
the wall. 
BOB 
Sam, if you're not doing 
anything New Year's -- 
obviously you're not doing 
his eyes well with 
tears) 
Oh babe.  I miss you so much it 
hurts. 
He reaches out for her.  She's gone. 
And we hear the television set now counting down to 
midnight in New York. 
CUT TO: 
INT. NEW YEAR'S EVE PARTY IN BALTIMORE - NIGHT 
The same television show counting down to midnight. 
Champagne corks popping, etc. 
And we see Walter and Annie. 
WALTER 
Happy New Year, darling. 
ANNIE 
Happy New Year. 
They start to dance. 
WALTER 
I was thinking, I have to go up 
to Boston for the AAP 
convention and then visit 
Winston-Hughes about switching 
over our computers.  Why don't 
we meet in New York for 
Valentine's Day weekend? 
ANNIE 
Walter, I'd love to -- 
WALTER 
We'll stay at the Plaza -- 
ANNIE 
Go for a walk in Central Park -- 
WALTER 
Go to the Symphony -- 
A beat. 
ANNIE 
We will? 
(beat) 
The Symphony? 
(beat) 
Okay. 
(beat) 
I'll take you to the Russian 
Tea Room for pelmeni. 
WALTER 
What is it? 
ANNIE 
It's delicious, trust me. 
WALTER 
Does it have wheat in it? 
ANNIE 
I don't think so. 
They go on dancing.  It's one of those parties where 
everyone looks so happy and so in love.  Annie, however, 
looks thoughtful. 
ET.  MARINA PARKING AREA - DAY 
Sam gets out of his car and starts down the dock toward 
his houseboat.  He's carrying a bag of groceries. 
In the parking lot is a U.S.  MAIL TRUCK. 
EXT. HOUSEBOAT - DAY 
Sam approaches his boat and a puzzled look comes over 
his face. 
A MAILMAN with a sack of mail is standing outside the 
front door of the houseboat.  Jonah is signing a receipt 
for the mail. 
JONAH 
Look at this, Dad.  They're 
all for you -- 
Sam picks up an envelop and looks at it.  It's 
addressed to Sleepless in Seattle c/o Dr.  Marcia 
Fieldstone, Radio Station KWRS in Chicago.  He's 
stunned.  As he signs the receipt: 
MAILMAN 
If you're having trouble 
sleeping, you might want to try 
drinking a glass of water from 
the other side. 
JONAH 
I thought that was for hiccups. 
MAILMAN 
Does it work for hiccups? 
JONAH 
For hiccups, a spoonful of 
sugar, you hold it in your 
mouth for a minute. 
MAILMAN 
Really? 
The mailman starts back toward the mail truck. 
Sam and Jonah start toward the door. 
INT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT 
Sam is in the kitchen making dinner.  Jonah is sitting 
at the table, reading the letters from the stack they 
found by the door. 
SAM 
Just out of curiosity, how did 
they get our address? 
JONAH 
They called and asked for it. 
(reading) 
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle. 
You are the most attractive man 
I've ever laid ears on." 
Jonah rolls his eyes, tosses the letter into a pile of 
rejects, opens another. 
SAM 
How did they get our phone 
number? 
JONAH 
You have to give them your 
phone number or they won't let 
you go on the air. 
Sam nods as if this makes perfect sense. 
JONAH 
(continues, reading) 
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I 
am an SWF"-- 
(to Sam) 
down. 
Past a sign saying: Seattle Approximately 3,000 miles. 
Past another sign: Your nerves are shot. 
And another: Your feet are cold. 
And another: Will you find love. 
And another: Before you're cold? 
And another: Burma Shave. 
And Annie continues to run, and now we see she's running 
across a map of the United States -- it's a little like 
the one we saw in the beginning of the movie -- it's 
like the famous map of the United States by Saul 
Steinberg, but instead of being about New York, this one 
is about Seattle. 
In the distance, at the very edge of the map, we see two 
indistinct figures -- a map and a young boy.  They start 
to wave at her, very slowly. 
Annie's eyes widen. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ANNIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Annie in bed, eyes open.  Walter fast asleep. 
She gets out of bed, puts on her robe (just as she did 
in the dream sequence). 
INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT 
As Annie comes down the stairs. 
INT. KITCHEN - HOUSE 
She turns the light on. 
Opens the refrigerator. 
Closes it. 
Opens it again.  Takes out some milk. 
Sits down at the kitchen table with a bowl, corn flakes, 
banana.  She's about to assemble it when: 
She sees: 
THE RADIO 
She stands up, turns it on to the station Dr. Marcia 
Fieldstone is on.  She sits back down with her corn 
flakes. 
ANNOUNCER (V.O.) 
Up next, "You and Your 
Emotions" with Dr.  Marcia 
Fieldstone, clinical 
psychologist and the best 
friend you never had. 
(the teaser continues) 
WOMAN'S VOICE (V.O.) 
He says he doesn't love me any 
more. 
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) 
Why do you want to be with 
someone who doesn't love you? 
ANOTHER WOMAN (V.O.) 
Every time I come close to 
orgasm he stops and goes to 
make himself a sandwich -- 
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) 
Why don't you make him a 
sandwich beforehand? 
SAM'S VOICE (V.O.) 
When I met my wife, it was so 
clear.  I jus knew. 
Annie starts at hearing Sam's voice. 
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) 
What was it that made you know? 
SAM'S VOICE (V.O.) 
I don't think I could really 
describe it. 
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.) 
Why not? 
SAM'S VOICE (V.O.) 
And if I could describe it, it 
probably wouldn't be on a radio 
show. 
(he laughs to himself) 
But what the hell.  It's not 
one specific thing.  It's more 
of a feeling. 
(continuing) 
You touch her for the first 
time, and suddenly... you're 
home.  It's almost like... 
magic. 
Annie closes her eyes. 
ANNOUNCER (V.O.) 
We'll be back after this 
commercial with Dr. Marcia 
Fieldstone. 
EXT. BALTIMORE - PEABODY LIBRARY - DAY 
We see Annie's car pull into a parking space outside the 
Peabody Library.  Annie gets out of the car. 
INT. LIBRARY - DAY 
As Annie strides purposefully across the library and 
enters: 
INT. ANNIE'S BROTHER TOM'S OFFICE - DAY 
Annie bursts into Tom's office and walks over to his 
desk.  We barely has time to look up. 
ANNIE 
I think I'm going crazy, Tom. 
I really do.  Are you happily 
married? 
TOM 
(completely panicked by 
the question) 
What? 
ANNIE 
I mean, why did you get 
married? Was it all fireworks 
and trumpets and -- 
TOM 
(regaining composure) 
I got married because Betsy 
said we had to break up or get 
married.  So we get married. 
ANNIE 
But when you met her, did you 
believe she was the only person 
for you? That in some mystical, 
cosmic way, it was fated? 
You'll like it. 
SAM 
(grimly) 
This is going to be tougher 
than I thought. 
EXT. HOUSEBOAT - EARLY EVENING 
Sam coming home. 
INT. HOUSEBOAT - EARLY EVENING 
As he enters.  It's very quiet.  Too quiet. 
SAM 
Jonah? 
No answers. 
SAM 
Jonah? 
He starts to look concerned. 
SAM 
Jonah? 
He goes down the hall to Jonah's room.  The door is 
shut.  He opens it. 
Jonah is sitting on his bed listening to a tape. 
Earphones on.  Next to him is a young girl named 
JESSICA. 
SAM 
Jonah? 
Jonah takes off the earphones. 
JONAH 
Hi, Dad.  Dad, this is Jessica. 
SAM 
It's nice to meet you, Jessica. 
JONAH 
Dad, this is amazing.  If you 
play this backwards, it says 
"Paul is dead." 
SAM 
I know. 
JONAH 
How do you know? 
Sam shrugs, turns to go back down the hall. 
JONAH 
Dad, could you close the door? 
JESSICA 
H and G. 
(Sam looks back) 
Hi and goodbye. 
Sam closes the door to Jonah's room. 
Hold on Sam. 
SAM 
(to himself) 
Get a life. 
INT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS 
As Sam comes downstairs, goes into his office.  Closes 
the door. 
INT. SAM'S OFFICE AT HOME - CONTINUOUS 
He goes to the phone.  Looks up a number in the phone 
book.  Picks up the phone and dials a number. 
SAM 
Hi, Victoria?... It's Sam 
Baldwin, I don't know if you 
remember me.  Oh?  Well, great. 
I was wondering if you wanted 
to have a drink... Friday, 
say... Dinner?... Sure, dinner 
would be fine.  Sure.  Dinner. 
INT. AN UNFINISHED DINNER ON A PLATE IN ANNIE'S LIVING ROOM 
- NIGHT 
Annie is watching "An Affair to Remember" on television, 
tears pouring down her face.  Cary Grant is saying: "Are 
you in love with him?" Deborah Kerr replies: "I'm not 
now." 
She's sitting at the dining room table.  A dozen pieces 
of paper litter the table.  Annie's been unsuccessfully 
typing a letter on an old Underwood typewriter. 
ANNIE 
Now those were the days when 
people knew how to be in love. 
She takes a blast from the wine glass to her right. 
Becky leans in, refilling the glass.  Annie begins to 
type and sob and look at the TV. 
BECKY 
You're a basket case. 
ANNIE 
(as she types) 
They knew it.  Time, distance, 
nothing could separate them. 
Because they knew.  It was 
right.  It was real.  It was... 
BECKY 
... movie. 
(beat) 
That's your problem.  You don't 
want to be in love.  You want 
to be in love in a movie. 
(beat) 
Read it to me. 
ANNIE 
(reading her letter) 
"Dear Sleepless and Son..." 
BECKY 
It sounds like the name of a 
mattress store -- 
ANNIE 
"I am not the sort of person 
who listens to call-in radio 
shows" -- 
Becky flops on the couch. 
BECKY 
And this woman is a writer! 
That's what everyone writes at 
the beginning of letters to 
strangers. 
ANNIE 
I know that.  You think I don't 
know that? "I know that's a 
dumb way to begin, but it's the 
only way I can think of to 
convey what happened to me the 
You're worried we're going to 
be all right.  We're going to 
be all right. 
(Sam gives Jonah a 
squeeze) 
I remember sometimes you'd have 
nightmares as a baby.  Your mom 
would hold you and rock you and 
sing you a song. 
JONAH 
Bye bye blackbird. 
SAM 
Is that what she used to sing? 
JONAH 
I miss her. 
(beat) 
What do you think happens to 
someone after they die? 
SAM 
I don't know. 
JONAH 
Like do you believe in heaven? 
SAM 
I never did.  Or the whole idea 
of an afterlife.  But I don't 
know any more.  I have these 
dreams about... your mom... and 
we have long talks about... 
about you, and how you are, 
which she sort of knows but I 
tell her anyway.  So what is 
that? It's sort of an afterlife, 
isn't it? 
JONAH 
I'm starting to forget her. 
SAM 
I know.  But she's here, Jonah. 
Because I have you.  And as 
long as I have you, I have your 
Mom. 
Hold on the two of them as music begins.  Bye Bye 
Blackbird. 
SAM 
I... uh... have a date with 
someone Friday night. 
JONAH 
Good. 
A beat. 
SAM 
Did I ever tell you about the 
time I ate a dog biscuit? 
As Jonah cuddles closer MUSIC COMES UP AS WE PULL BACK 
FROM THE BED AND... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. ANNIE'S TOWNHOUSE - LATE NIGHT 
AS MUSIC CONTINUES.  Annie waves as Becky gets into her 
car and rides away.  Annie turns to her doorway and 
stops.  She can't go back in.  She needs to walk and 
think.  She crosses the street into a little 
neighborhood park.  We can see the moon. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SAM'S HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT 
Sam comes out onto the porch.  Flops down in his deck 
chair.  The city lights in the background.  Same moon. 
The MUSIC CONTINUES. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. PARK - NIGHT 
Annie flops down on a child's swing set in the park. 
MUSIC CONTINUES. 
CUT TO: 
CLOSE ON SAM 
CLOSE ON ANNIE 
AND A LONG SHOT OF ANNIE IN THE SWING 
As Walter pulls up into the parking space Becky pulled 
out of.  Annie starts toward him. 
A LONG SHOT OF SAM ON THE BACK OF THE BOAT 
Make my bed and light the lights I'll arrive late 
tonight, blackbird, bye bye. 
FADE IN: 
INT. BALTIMORE SUN - DAY 
Annie on the phone at her desk. 
ANNIE 
Laurie, it's Annie.  Fine, I'm 
fine.  Listen, I'm doing an 
article on call-in radio shows. 
Do you know anyone who works 
for someone named Dr. Marcia 
Fieldstone...? 
CUT TO: 
Annie on the phone. 
ANNIE 
I'm a writer for the Baltimore 
Sun and I'm a friend of Laurie 
Johnson's.  I'm doing a piece 
on how people handle 
bereavement and I understand 
that you had a caller the other 
night... I know you're not 
supposed to, but Laurie said 
you might, and I'll plug the 
show and everything -- 
(she winces in 
anticipation of a 
rejection, but then 
her face relaxes) 
CUT TO: 
Annie dialing Sam's telephone number. 
JONAH (ON MACHINE) 
This is Jonah Baldwin, we're 
not in right now but you can 
leave -- 
Annie hangs up. 
ANNIE 
Baldwin. 
CUT TO: 
Annie at her computer modem.  She's dialing a number. 
that piece of information. 
WHEEDLE 
No, that's free.  He's an 
architect.  Used to do big 
high-profile projects.  He 
scaled it all back when his 
wife died.  Now he remodels 
people's homes.  He works in 
a small firm, makes a good 
living. 
He shows her a good picture of him. 
ANNIE 
He's real. 
She goes to the next shot.  Sees a picture of Sam and 
Victoria in the restaurant, although all we see of 
Victoria is her back and mane of blond hair. 
Hold on Annie's face. 
INT. SEATTLE MARKETPLACE 
With its stalls of king crab, but otherwise almost 
identical in design to the Baltimore marketplace. 
Sam and Jonah walk past the fish stand, Sam looking 
around, slightly distracted. 
JONAH 
I figure we could go to New 
York, catch the Knicks, and 
since we'd be there anyway, 
obviously we'd go to the Empire 
State Building -- 
SAM 
There she is. 
As Victoria comes toward them, with a bag full of 
groceries. 
JONAH 
Why is she bringing that bag? 
SAM 
She's going to cook something 
for us? 
VICTORIA 
Hi, Sam.  And let me guess -- 
you must be Jonah. 
JONAH 
Hi. 
(back to the subject) 
He should book now because we 
can get an excursion fare. 
Jessica's parents are travel 
agents and -- 
SAM 
Not now, Jonah. 
INT. HOUSEBOAT - LATER 
Sam, Jonah and Victoria are at the dining room table, 
finishing the dinner that Victoria cooked. 
SAM 
We can't finish the job.  She's 
on her sixth painter, now she's 
thinking maybe she wants the 
fireplace rebricked -- 
VICTORIA 
I know her pretty well.  Maybe 
I could call her -- 
SAM 
I've already solved it.  I've 
hired a hit man. 
Victoria laughs a little too hard. 
VICTORIA 
Oh that is so funny, you are so 
funny. 
Sam smiles.  Jonah is appalled. 
SAM 
Every time she wants to change 
something, she talks in this 
little baby voice -- 
(in a little baby 
voice) 
"Couldn't you just move the 
stairway a teeny tiny bit?"-- 
Victoria almost dies laughing.  Jonah's eyes narrow to 
slits. 
JONAH 
Do you like baseball? 
VICTORIA 
Yes, I do.  In fact, my firm has 
box seats for the Mariners. 
Why don't we all go next week? 
JONAH 
What about camping? 
VICTORIA 
What about it? 
JONAH 
Do you like it? 
VICTORIA 
I went camping once. 
(to Sam) 
I love to brush my teeth in a 
brook and floss with a weed. 
JONAH 
We ought to start camping 
again, Dad. 
SAM 
Okay, tiger.  Time for bed. 
JONAH 
It's only ten o'clock. 
SAM 
(a little edgy) 
Jonah! 
JONAH 
Okay. 
SAM 
Thank Victoria for dinner. 
JONAH 
Thanks for dinner.  I never saw 
anybody cook potatoes that way. 
SAM 
(gracious) 
I'm glad you liked it.  Good 
night, Jonah. 
work. 
(she hangs up, turns 
off radio) 
Walter, you scared me.  Don't 
ever do that again. 
INT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT 
As Sam holds Jonah by the shoulders. 
SAM 
Don't ever do that again. 
JONAH 
I thought I saw a black widow 
spider. 
Sam looks at Victoria, shrugs.  Back to Jonah. 
SAM 
What are you doing up? 
JONAH 
I was thirsty. 
SAM 
There's a bathroom upstairs. 
JONAH 
The water tastes better in the 
kitchen. 
SAM 
That's true.  Why is that? 
INT. ANNIE'S TOWNHOUSE APARTMENT - NIGHT 
As she and Walter go upstairs to bed. 
ANNIE 
Becky heard this woman on the 
radio complaining about this 
guy she was sure was Rick, 
which meant he was cheating on 
her.  She was completely 
hysterical.  Then it turned out 
the woman lived in Duluth. 
WALTER 
That doesn't make any sense. 
ANNIE 
I know.  It makes no sense at 
all.  Thank God my life is in 
place. 
INT. ANNIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Walter asleep.  Annie stares up at the ceiling, wide 
awake.  Thinking. 
INT. JONAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Jonah lying on his pillow, staring up at the ceiling, 
wide awake.  Thinking. 
INT. JESSICA'S PARENTS' TRAVEL AGENCY - DAY 
Jessica is reading the letter from Annie.  She's sitting 
at a computer in their travel agency, which is on the 
entrance level to a charming Seattle townhouse.  Jonah 
sitting there. 
JESSICA 
Write her. 
JONAH 
You think so? 
JESSICA 
It's Y. O. H. 
JONAH 
(agreeing) 
Yeah. 
(a beat) 
What's that? 
JESSICA 
Your only hope. 
INT. NEWSROOM - DAY 
Annie, at her computer, talking to Becky. 
ANNIE 
I thought I would look into 
doing a story about those radio 
shows. 
BECKY 
(nods; after a beat) 
You'd probably have to go 
somewhere to really look into 
it. 
ANNIE 
Definitely. 
EXT. STREET OUTSIDE JESSICA'S HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER 
Jonah and Jessica at the mailbox.  As Jonah opens the 
mailbox and drops the letter in, we hear a SQUEAL OF 
BRAKES.  It's Sam's car. 
SAM 
(angry) 
Get in the car right this 
minute. 
Jonah, about to get in, looks at Jessica. 
JESSICA 
I'll call you later. 
Jonah gets in. 
INT. SAM'S CAR - CONTINUOUS 
SAM 
Did you call that radio station 
again? 
JONAH 
No. 
SAM 
Everyone at work heard you. 
JONAH 
I just called for a second. 
SAM 
Long enough to call Victoria a 
ho. 
JONAH 
It's a short word. 
SAM 
This is not a joke.  Thank God 
Victoria doesn't know.  It 
would really have hurt her 
feelings. 
JONAH 
(really getting into 
it) 
If she knew, she'd never 
forgive me.  It would be 
hopeless for the two of you. 
EXT. SEATTLE STREET - CONTINUOUS 
I'm never going to meet anyone 
who's going to measure up to 
your mom in your eyes? What do 
you think? There's a perfect 
woman walking around out there? 
At that moment, Annie emerges from the jetway right next 
to the one Victoria went into and comes toward us. 
SAM 
There's no such thing as a 
perf -- 
Sam sees Annie immediately, and is instantly struck by 
her looks, her fluidity, her poise. 
Annie walks right toward Sam, right past him, inches 
from him, not noticing him as she looks for the exit. 
Sam continues to stare at her. 
SAM 
(to himself, referring 
to Annie) 
God, she's beautiful. 
JONAH 
(unaware he's talking 
about Annie) 
Victoria? She's okay. 
Sam and Jonah start toward the exit, Sam trying not to 
lose sight of Annie. 
JONAH 
Dad, I was talking to Jessica 
about reincarnation, and she 
thinks that probably you knew 
Annie in another life. 
SAM 
(completely distracted) 
Who is Annie? 
JONAH 
The one who wrote us. 
Sam is preoccupied with Annie.  She takes a turn that he 
doesn't expect.  He's having trouble keeping up, because 
he has to wait for Jonah. 
JONAH 
(continuing) 
But Jessica says you and Annie 
never got together in that 
life, and your hearts are like 
puzzles with parts out of them 
and when you get together the 
puzzle's complete. 
He's lost Annie in the crowd.  She's nowhere in sight. 
SAM 
God dammit. 
A beat, then Sam heads off to the exit.  Jonah follows. 
As they walk into the distance -- 
JONAH 
The reason I know this and you 
don't is that I'm younger and 
purer so I'm more in touch with 
cosmic forces. 
SAM 
I sincerely hope you are not 
going to marry Jessica. 
EXT. AIRPORT CAR RENTAL AGENCY - DAY 
As the shuttle bus drops Annie off at a rental car.  As 
she gets in and starts the car. 
EXT/INT. SEATTLE/RENTAL CAR - DAY 
Annie driving through the streets of Seattle, referring 
continually to a map she has spread out on the passenger 
seat, trying to navigate her way to the Baldwin houseboat. 
EXT. STREET FRONTING THE BALDWIN HOUSEBOAT SLIP -- DAY 
Annie drives slowly down the street, looking for the 
Baldwins' marina.  She stops, blocking the driveway to 
the marina. 
ON ANNIE IN HER RENTAL CAR 
checking the map. 
Suddenly she hears a HORN HONKING behind her.  She looks 
into the rear-view mirror and sees Sam and Jonah in 
their van, anxious for her to move so they can pull into 
their driveway. 
Recognizing Sam from Wheedle's picture, Annie panics and 
speeds away, tires squealing. 
EXT. SEATTLE GAS STATION - DAY 
Annie's car is parked just outside the rest room. 
INT. GAS STATION RESTROOM - DAY 
Annie's in the Ladies' Room, splashing some water on her 
face.  She towels it off and looks into the mirror. 
ANNIE 
(practicing) 
Hello, Mr.  Baldwin? No. 
Hello, Sam? 
(sweet) 
I'm Annie Reed. 
(dignified) 
I'm Annie Reed. 
(sultry) 
I'm Annie Reed. 
(matter-of-fact) 
I'm Annie Reed. 
She settles on the matter-of-fact reading. 
ANNIE 
I heard about you calling Dr. 
Fieldstone, and well, I just 
happened to be out here on... 
JUMP CUT: 
ANNIE 
(businesslike) 
business... 
JUMP CUT: 
ANNIE 
(carefree) 
vacation... 
JUMP CUT: 
ANNIE 
(losing confidence, 
ready to pack it in) 
for no good reason at all... 
(rallying, businesslike 
again) 
business... and I thought I'd 
when he started running. 
ON ANNIE 
She comes to a standstill, in the middle of the street. 
In shock.  The scene in front of her is too horrible to 
bear. 
ANNIE'S POV - GATE TO MARINA 
Sam catches up.  Suzy -- no less beautiful and vivacious 
than she was before -- tousles Jonah's hair, kisses Sam 
and hugs them both. 
ON SAM, JONAH AND SUZY. 
SAM 
God, it's wonderful to see you. 
Where's Greg? 
SUZY 
He's over at the boat show. 
He'll be by later. 
(she looks around) 
It's so beautiful here. 
ANNIE 
There is such apparent warmth, and joy, and love about 
this homecoming that she forget where she is -- in the 
middle of the street.  A car HORN blares at her... all 
she can do is stare at the nightmare that has unfolded. 
She starts to back away -- and that's when she sees -- 
A TAXICAB 
coming right at her, horn BLARING, tires SQUEALING. 
Annie starts to jump to the other lane but there's a van 
bearing down from the opposite direction.  She steps 
back to the middle line. 
The cab goes into a skid.  Annie freezes. 
Sam heard the noise and turns to see what's going on. 
The cab comes SCREECHING right at the CAMERA. 
Annie screams. 
The cab stops inches from her body.  The van in the 
other oncoming lane fishtails to a stop as well. 
ON SAM 
responding.  He runs from the gate toward the near- 
accident. 
ON THE CAB DRIVER 
getting out of the cab, as other people gawk from the 
sidewalk. 
DRIVER 
Lady, what the hell are you 
doing? 
Annie, still in shock from her brush with disaster, 
hears the Cabbie but doesn't respond.  Stunned, she 
turns to see Sam on the other side of the street.  Their 
eyes meet.  Sam stops, realizing it's the woman he saw 
in the airport. 
SAM 
Hello. 
ANNIE 
Hello. 
Annie, totally mortified and humiliated by everything 
that's happened, bolts for her car. 
Sam wants to run after her -- but there's traffic is 
coming past and he can't cross the street.  Annie gets 
into her car, starts and pulls away.  Sam stands there, 
deflated. 
EXT. AIRPLANE - IN FLIGHT ACROSS THE U.S. - DAY 
ANNIE (V.O.) 
How could I have been such an 
idiot? 
EXT. BALTIMORE STREET - DUSK 
Becky's car driving toward Annie's house. 
BECKY 
You were standing in the middle 
of the street? 
INT. BECKY'S CAR - DUSK 
ANNIE 
You know that dream where 
you're walking down the street 
naked and everyone is looking 
at you? 
BECKY 
I love that dream. 
ANNIE 
That was nothing compared to 
this humiliation, nothing. 
BECKY 
But he saw you, right? 
ANNIE 
He said hello. 
EXT. TOWNHOUSE - ON ANNIE & BECKY - DUSK 
As Annie leads the way to her door, from Becky's car. 
BECKY 
And what did you say? 
Annie takes the mail from the mailbox on her way to the 
door. 
ANNIE 
All I could think of to say was 
hello. 
CUT TO:

INT. ANNIE'S TOWNHOUSE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Becky and Annie looking at the television. 
BECKY 
It's a sign -- 
ANNIE 
It's a sign I've watched this 
movie too many times. 
(beat) 
I'm so stupid.  From the minute 
I listen to that stupid program 
on the radio, I've been a 
complete jerk. 
She starts absently going through the mail, throwing 
almost all of it away without even opening it. 
BECKY 
You don't know who she was, 
Annie -- 
ANNIE 
I saw her.  She looked just 
like this -- 
They met at the Empire State 
Building, only they didn't. 
Never mind. 
GREG 
What kind of person would write 
to someone they heard on the 
radio? 
SAM 
I got hundreds of letters from 
women all over the country -- 
GREG 
Desperate women -- 
SUZY 
Just because someone's looking 
for a nice guy doesn't make 
them desperate. 
GREG 
How about rapacious and love- 
starved? 
SUZY 
No. 
GREG 
It is easier to be killed by a 
terrorist -- 
SUZY 
It is not -- 
GREG 
Right, right. 
Suzy's irritated. 
SAM 
Anyway, Victoria's nice. 
SUZY 
Would you follow her through an 
airport? 
SAM 
Look, I met somebody.  She's 
good, and capable and smart. 
We hit it off.  We can't spend 
your life chasing after 
fantasies. 
Jonah is devastated by the realization that his dad is 
serious about Victoria. 
INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - ON SAM IN BED - NIGHT 
The door to his bedroom opens. 
Annie walks in.  She's wearing a white men's shirt. 
ANNIE 
Hi. 
SAM 
Hi. 
(a beat) 
So far so good.  So.  What 
should we talk about? How 
insecure we were in high 
school.  Shirley Votypka, the 
first girl I ever felt up. 
Health.  What about health? 
Did you know that eating six 
macadamia nuts is the 
equivalent of eating a steak? 
ANNIE 
Shhhh -- 
She unbuttons her shirt. 
And they kiss. 
FREEZE FRAME on the kiss.  It becomes the silhouette of 
a man and a woman kissing. 
AND PULL BACK TO REVEAL: 
The silhouette of a man and a woman kissing on a red box 
of Valentine's Day chocolates and now we see: 
EXT. BALTIMORE - VALENTINE'S DAY - DAY 
A few quick shot of Valentine's Day in Baltimore: shop 
windows lined with candy displays of red satin hearts, 
lacy Valentine cards, red roses in elaborate floral 
arrangements, old ladies selling chocolates, young 
ladies selling perfume. 
A red Valentine's envelope is being tossed on a desk, 
and pull back to reveal: 
INT. BALTIMORE SUN - DAY 
Annie at work.  She looks at the card and opens it. 
It's from Walter.  She smiles.  Looks up.  There's 
Becky. 
BECKY 
You're going to miss the train. 
ANNIE 
No, I'm not. 
(she starts assembling 
her things) 
BECKY 
What are your plans in New 
York? 
ANNIE 
We're going to the Rainbow Room 
and the symphony tomorrow night. 
BECKY 
I love the symphony. 
ANNIE 
(cheerfully) 
I hate it. 
(she stands to go, 
starts toward the 
elevator) 
I'm so happy, Becky.  Finally I 
feel happy.  This is right. 
This is real.  Everything else 
is what happens when you watch 
too many movies and completely 
lose sight of what counts. 
(as she steps into 
elevator) 
Please don't tell anyone about 
what happened.  "Sleepless in 
Seattle" is history. 
INT. BALTIMORE TRAIN STATION - DAY

move out of the station. 
MAP OF THE UNITED STATES. 
The map we saw at the beginning of the movie, as the 
As Annie and Walter walk through the jewelry department 
to the elevator. 
ANNIE 
I started to wonder whether we 
were the human equivalent of 
two rights making a wrong, you 
know? 
Walter has no idea what she means, but he's completely 
good-natured about it. 
INT. THIRD FLOOR TIFFANY'S - DAY 
Annie and Walter are walking around the floor, followed 
by a SALESWOMAN who is carrying a large white card on 
which she is noting their selections. 
ANNIE 
It was like kismet but not, if 
you see what I mean. 
Walter's brow furrows slightly. 
ANNIE 
(continuing) 
You have to grow up.  You can't 
have all these adolescent 
dreams about how exciting your 
life is going to be -- 
Walter starting to look puzzled. 
ANNIE 
(continuing) 
Don't hate me but I love this 
pattern. 
WALTER 
You couldn't. 
ANNIE 
I do. 
WALTER 
It's just like my grandmother's 
china. 
SALESWOMAN 
How many place settings should 
I put down? 
ANNIE & WALTER 
Ten. 
Walter beams at her. 
WALTER 
Exactly.  Eight is too few and 
twelve is too many. 
The SALESWOMAN writes a "10" on the big sheet of paper. 
INT. FIRST FLOOR - TIFFANY'S - DAY 
As Annie and Walter come out of the elevator on the 
ground floor and WALTER stops for a moment at the 
Jewelry Repair department, reappears with a little blue 
Tiffany's box he gives to Annie. 
Annie opens it. 
Inside is a lovely antique diamond ring. 
ANNIE 
Walter. 
WALTER 
It was my mother's. 
ANNIE 
It's so beautiful.  It's just 
what I would have picked out if 
I'd had every ring in the world 
to choose from. 
(as she slips the ring 
onto her finger) 
You see what I mean.  There are 
people who would like a 
relationship to be full of 
surprises, but I am not one of 
them. 
(as she starts out the 
door with Walter 
behind, thinking about 
what she has just 
said) 
Surprises are highly overrated. 
As they go out the door to: 
EXT. FIFTH AVE.  - DAY 
As they start down the street and go off into the 
distance. 
ANNIE 
(continuing) 
Promise me something, Walter. 
Promise me you will never have 
a surprise party for me.  Ever. 
You know what happens, you walk 
in the door in some horrible 
sweater you put on that morning, 
and there are hundreds of people 
in their best clothes shouting 
"Surprise!" 
INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Sam's got a suitcase on the bed, packing.  Jonah is 
standing in the doorway, watching. 
He goes to his desk looking for something but can't find 
it.  He tries a few drawers. 
SAM 
Have you seen my wallet? 
JONAH 
It might be in the kitchen. 
Sam doesn't remember leaving it in the kitchen. 
SAM 
I'm only going to be away one 
night, okay, and Clarise will 
be here.  You'll have a swell 
time.  You'll watch a little 
Geraldo, some Nightmare on Elm 
Street 12, I'll never know. 
JONAH 
Are you going with her? 
SAM 
Yes. 
Jonah walks out of Sam's bedroom and we hear the door to 
his bedroom slam shut. 
ON SAM 
Starting to boil. 
He walks into -- 
INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Next. 
Jonah steps forward, with his ticket. 
INT. JESSICA'S HOUSE - DAY 
Jessica is sitting defiantly in a chair in the middle of 
the living room.  She is being interrogated but she is 
not going to talk.  There's a clock on the mantel.  Sam 
is in the room with Jessica's mother and father. 
JESSICA'S MOTHER 
Jessica, this is not 
acceptable. 
JESSICA'S FATHER 
If you don't tell us right now, 
right this minute, I'm going to 
kill you. 
Jessica rolls her eyes. 
She looks over the clock on the mantel.  As it ticks 
to 8:30: 
JESSICA 
He's on his way to New York. 
JESSICA'S MOTHER 
What? 
SAM 
How? 
JESSICA 
(the child of travel 
agents) 
United 597. 
Jessica's mother and father are horrified. 
JESSICA'S MOTHER 
Jessica! 
SAM 
When does it leave? 
JESSICA'S FATHER 
Eight-thirty. 
Everyone looks over at the clock.  It says 8:31. 
Jessica smiles. 
INT. SAM'S CAR - DAY 
CLOSE ON SAM 
Driving to the airport. 
EXT. HIGHWAY NEAR SEATTLE/TACOMA AIRPORT - DAY 
As his car takes the airport exit. 
INT. AIRPLANE - DAY 
A stewardess bends affectionately over Jonah, ensconced 
in the first-class section.  He's got his backpack on 
his lap and he's holding it. 
STEWARDESS 
Here you go... here's a nice pin 
for you, for flying with us. 
JONAH 
(completely unmoved, 
but polite) 
Thank you. 
STEWARDESS 
You're welcome.  Can I take 
that for you? 
JONAH 
(clutching it even 
tighter) 
No. 
INT. AIRPORT TICKET COUNTER - ON SAM - DAY 
at the reservations desk.  Desperation. 
SAM 
(frantic) 
He's about this high, 90 
pounds, never combs his hair, 
Mariner's hat -- 
AIRLINE CLERK 
(to his colleagues) 
Anyone check in a 
unaccompanied minor on the New 
York flight? 
FIRST CLASS TICKET CLERK 
I did. 
Sam closes his eyes. 
SAM 
I'll kill him. 
(beat) 
I have to get to New York as 
fast as I can. 
AIRLINE CLERK 
We can get you on a flight to 
Chicago and you can change 
planes -- 
Starting to punch information into the computer. 
AIRLINE CLERK 
How will you be paying for 
this? 
SAM 
(taking out his wallet) 
American Express. 
(there's no American 
Express card in his 
wallet) 
Visa. 
(beat) 
I really am going to kill him. 
INT. O'HARA AIRPORT - DAY 
As Sam comes out of the plane from Seattle and dashes 
through the concourse, managing to arrive at the plane 
for New York at the very last moment. 
INT. KENNEDY AIRPORT - DAY 
As Jonah comes out of the plane from Seattle and looks 
up to see which way to go.  He looks very small.  Big 
New York passengers in a hurry whiz by with their 
carryons dangerously flying at their sides. 
EXT. KENNEDY AIRPORT - A FEW MINUTES LATER 
Jonah stands in a taxi line. 
INT. TAXI - A FEW MINUTES LATER 
Jonah sits down in the back seat.  Looks up.  A big 
bruiser of a CAB DRIVER leans back over the seat, sizing 
Jonah up. 
TAXI DRIVER 
Where to? 
JONAH 
Empire State Building. 
INT. PLANE TO NEW YORK - DAY

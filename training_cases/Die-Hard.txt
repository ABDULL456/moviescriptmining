"DIE HARD" 
FADE IN 
1       405 FREEWAY - LOS ANGELES - EARLY EVENING              1 
Christmas tinsel on the light poles.  We ARE LOOKING east past Inglewood INTO the orange grid of L.A. at night when suddenly we TILT UP TO CATCH the huge belly of a landing 747 -- the noise is deafening. 
2       INT. 747 - PASSENGERS - SAME                           2 
The usual moment just after landing when you let out that sigh of relief that you've made it in one piece.  As the plane TAXIS to its gate, they stir, gather personal belongings. 
3       ON JOHN MCCLANE                                        3 
mid-thirties, good-looking, athletic and tired from his trip. He sits by the window.  His relief on landing is subtle, but we NOTICE.  Suddenly, he hears -- 
SALESMAN'S VOICE You don't like flying, do you? 
McClane turns, looks at the Babbit clone next to him.  Caught, he tenses, holds his armrests in exaggerated fear. 
MCCLANE No, no, where'd you get that idea? 
SALESMAN (smiling) Ya wanna know the secret of successful air travel?  After you get where you're going, ya take off your shoes and socks. Then ya walk around on the rug barefoot and make fists with your toes. 
MCCLANE Fists with your toes. 
SALESMAN Maybe it's not a fist when it's your toes...I mean like this...work out that time zone tension. (demonstrating) Better'n a cup of coffee and a hot shower for the old jet lag.  I know it sounds crazy.  Trust me.  I've been doing it for nine years. 
The plane stops.  Passengers rise, start to take down overhead luggage.  McClane does this, but as he opens the door above, the businessman BLANCHES seeing: 
3-A     HIS P.O.V. - MCCLANE'S BARETTA PISTOL                  3-A 
Peeking out from his jacket. 
3-B     BACK TO SCENE                                          3-B 
Recognizing the look, McClane smiles reassuringly. 
MCCLANE It's okay. (showing badge) I'm a cop. (pause) Trust me.  I've been doing it for eleven. 
The businessman relaxes, moves off.  McClane now wrestles down the biggest Teddy Bear FAO Schwartz had to offer.  Balancing this, he moves down to another overhead, takes out a topcoat and an overnighter.  Barely managing all this, he turns, COLLIDING WITH: 
3-C     A PRETTY STEWARDESS                                    3-C 
She bumps noses with the bear, gives a look. 
STEWARDESS (smiling, about the bear) Maybe you should have bought her a ticket. 
MCCLANE Her? 
He scrutinizes the nether regions of the bear, shrugs. 
MCCLANE She doesn't complain. 
STEWARDESS (eying him) Neither would I. 
McClane smiles, with just enough of a sigh to know he's as wistful about things-that-might-have-been as she is...moves down the aisle. 
CUT TO: 
4       INT. THE NAKATOMI BUILDING (LOS ANGELES) - EVENING     4 
Takagi smiles, leads the way.  As they approach Holly's office door, McClane notices the name there is -- again -- "Gennero". 
TAKAGI Holly went to the Vault room to FAX some documents...she should be back any... 
16      HOLLY'S OFFICE                                         16 
Ellis is behind the desk.  He's SNIFFLING and just as they come in he SWEEPS the back of the slick desktop with his hand. 
Both McClane and Takagi catch on...but Takagi tries to hide his awareness. 
ELLIS Ah...hi...I just had to make a quick call, and this was the nearest phone... 
TAKAGI (as Ellis rises) Ellis, this is John McClane... (with meaning) Holly's policeman? (to McClane) Ellis is in charge of International Acquisitions. 
MCCLANE (shaking hands with Ellis) That explains the recent deal with Bolivia. 
Ellis REACTS, runs a checking finger under his nose. 
MCCLANE (sotto) Relax, Ellis.  I'm off duty. 
TAKAGI (eager to change the subject, to McClane) Can I get you anything?  Food?  Cake? Watered down champagne punch? 
MCCLANE (grinning) I'm fine. (looking through the glass) You throw quite a party.  I didn't know they had Christmas in Japan. 
TAKAGI Hey, we're flexible.  Pearl Harbor didn't work out, we got you with tape decks. 
McClane laughs.  He likes this guy. 
ELLIS Actually, it's kind of a double celebration.        * We closed a pretty big deal today and a lot of it was due to Holly. 
The door OPENS.  Holly comes inside. 
HOLLY All set, Joe.  The contracts went over the wire, and -- (surprised) John...! 
16-A    MCCLANE AND HOLLY                                      16-A 
A moment.  Does the sound of the party stop for him?  We know it.  For her?  It's more cryptic.  We sure hope so. 
HOLLY (recovering) I was hoping you made that flight. 
JOHN (quietly) I was hoping you were hoping that. 
She laughs, kisses him on the cheek.  Ellis notes the awkwardness. 
TAKAGI (to McClane) You wife's made for this business. She know how to drive a hard bargain. 
MCCLANE Yeah.  I remember our first date. 
ELLIS Show him the watch. 
As she hesitates: 
ELLIS Go on, show him.  What're you, embarrassed? (to McClane) A little token of our appreciation for all her work. 
He takes Holly's wrist, holds it up.  McClane smoothly takes the wrist away from Ellis, looks at the watch. 
MCCLANE Nice, but one of us is three hours out of sync.  I think it's me. (to Holly, pointedly) Is there a place I can wash up? 
HOLLY (happy for the excuse) Sure.  Follow me. 
They go out.  Alone, Takagi's look at Ellis shows his disapproval of certain snow at Christmas. 
CUT TO: 
17      EXT. NAKATOMI - NIGHT                                  17 
An Emory freight truck turns off Olympic into the underground parking garage of Nakatomi. 
18      INT. PARKING GARAGE                                    18 
It goes down the ramp and passes Argyle's black limo.  The driver's seat is EMPTY. 
19      INT. LIMO - SAME                                       19 
Argyle sits in the back seat hidden from the outside world by the tinted rear windows.  He is making a drink from the bar with the TV on and his rap music blasting from the cassette player, oblivious to the truck passing behind him. 
20      INT. PARKING GARAGE - SAME                             20 
The Emory truck stops in front of the service elevator on the next level down.  As the truck idles, the uniformed driver makes a note on his clipboard. 
21      INT. ELLIS' OFFICE - NIGHT                             21 
TILT UP FROM McClane's BARE FEET.  He is clenching and unclenching his toes. 
MCCLANE (surprised, actually feeling tension decline) Son-of-a-bitch.  It works. 
Holly sits on the desk here, watches him remove his jacket, tie shirt, etc.  Begin to wash up in the private bath. 
HOLLY What are you doing? 
MCCLANE It's a long story.  You know, I think that Ellis has his eye on you. 
HOLLY That's okay... (pause) ... I have an eye on his private bathroom. 
28      THE ESCALATORS TO THE GARAGE COME TO A STOP            28 
29      OUT                                             OUT    29 
30      CONTROL ROOM - SAME                                    30 
Theo finishes typing and disconnects the keyboard and pulls out the wires from beneath the panel. 
31      INT. LOBBY - SAME                                      31 
The doors to a service elevator open TO REVEAL HANS GRUBER, impeccably dressed, lean and handsome, he steps out into the lobby like he owns the building -- and in a way he does. 
Theo steps to the door of the control room and tosses Hans a COMPUTER CARD. 
Hans goes to the front door, waves the card over a magnetic plate.  An LED BLINKS and the door LOCKS with a THUD. 
Hans looks out at the street.  Appropriately enough, "not a creature is stirring."  Century City is quiet. 
32-     OUT                                             OUT    32- 
35-A    LOBBY - QUICK CUTS                                     35-A 
An elevator opens REVEALING TEN MORE MEN, all armed with Kalashnikov machine guns are carrying canvas kit bags.  One of them, EDDIE, a rugged American in his twenties, goes to the dead guard and immediately begins changing into his cloths. 
Meanwhile: 
A)  Karl takes a tool case from the elevator and joins his brother TONY, first playfully grabbing him.  They head for the basement stairwell; 
B)  Theo leaves the control room and nods to Hans. 
C)  Eddie finished adjusting buttons and snaps on his pilfered uniform, takes his position behind the front desk. 
36      HANS                                                   36 
looks at his watch and seems pleased.  He steps into the service elevator with the others and presses the button for the 30th floor.  The entire sequence has taken maybe sixty seconds. 
37      INT. ELLIS' BATHROOM - 30th FLOOR - SAME               37 
McClane is still barefoot, his pant legs now rolled up above his ankles.  He stretches his toes again.  Damn, it works.  He lights up a new Marlboro, dials a number on the (bathroom) phone. 
38      INT. BUILDING BASEMENT - PHONE ROOM                    38 
A large sign says:  PACIFIC BELL EMPLOYEES ONLY.  Inside Tony stands in front of an intimidating matrix of phone lines -- but what he has in mind won't require a doctorate in Electrical Engineering.  Karl comes over, gives his an elder brother's punch on the arm, points out what to do.  Together they focus on four CPV plastic conduits which run out of the main panel over their heads.  Tony nods.  Opens a case REVEALING a compact electric chainsaw. 
39      INT. ELLIS' BATHROOM - RESUME                          39 
MCCLANE (on phone) Argyle...? 
40      INT. LIMO                                              40 
Argyle is reclining on the seat.  The music is on so loud that it is nearly impossible to hear. 
ARGYLE Hey, John, what's the word on you and your lady? 
MCCLANE'S VOICE The vote's not in yet. 
41      INT. PHONE ROOM - SAME                                 41 
Karl cuts through the four tubes one at a time. 
42      INT. ELLIS' BATHROOM - SAME                            42 
McClane on the phone. 
ARGYLE'S VOICE (mocking) 'Vote's not in yet?'  What's that supposed to mean. 
MCCLANE What do you want, 'All My Children'? We're making progress.  After I get my foot out of my mouth, we'll really be cooking, and then I can -- 
He stops and gently taps the phone cradle.  No dial tone. 
43      INT. LIMO                                             43 
Argyle looks at the phone. 
ARGYLE What?...Mr. Mac, you there? 
He turns down the music but there is on one on the line. 
ARGYLE (to himself) Well, call me back, John.  You got the number. 
He hangs up and turns the volume back up. 
44      ELLIS' OFFICE                                         44 
McClane hangs up the original phone and then tries the other one on the desk.  It, too, is dead. 
45      INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR                                 45 
Hans and the others approaching the 30th floor.  As they grow closer, we hear the noise of the speakers growing louder and louder.  The men cock their weapons and brace themselves as the car stops and the elevator doors open.  ON THE SOUND OF GUNSHOTS AND SCREAMS WE: 
CUT TO: 
46      INT. ELLIS' OFFICE                                     46 
76      INT. NAKATOMI - GROUND FLOOR OPERATIONS ROOM - SAME   76 
A fire alarm indicator light showing which floor has sounded the fire alarm -- suddenly begins flashing, emitting short, loud beeps.  Eddie, the terrorist in the guard's uniform and manning the station, immediately picks up his CB. 
77      32ND FLOOR - SAME                                     77 
McClane stands at windows looking Northward for fire trucks. Suddenly we SEE the flashing red lights of FOUR ENGINES in traffic two miles away. 
MCCLANE C'mon, baby...come to Papa.  I'm gonna kiss your Goddamn dalmatian. 
78      INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR - ON HANS - SAME                78 
He rides the elevator back to the 30th floor with Tony. 
HANS (calmly, to Eddie on CB) Call 911, give them the name and badge number on your uniform and cancel the alarm...then disable the system. (looks across at Tony, presses talk button again) Eddie?  What floor did the alarm go off? 
78-A    MACHINE FLOOR                                         78-A 
They've heard the alarm here, too.  Heinrich, Marco and       * Uli HEAR the alarm and continue their mysterious work. 
79      UNFINISHED FLOOR - SAME                               79 
McClane stands silhouetted against the window.  In the distance he can see another fire truck swing off Santa Monica onto Avenue of the Stars. 
Suddenly the red light on the first truck goes out, then on the second.  McClane watches in disbelief.  The trucks slow and turn down separate side streets, heading for home. 
MCCLANE (realizing) Son of a bitch... 
Just then the elevator bell rings and we HEAR the ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN.  A figure (Tony) slips into the shadows -- his machine gun drawn.  We MOVE WITH HIM FROM the elevator area until he reaches the light switch and throws it illuminating the entire floor.  McClane is gone. 
80      ON MCCLANE                                            80 
under a desk.  He takes in his options. 
81      HIS P.O.V.                                            81 
The feet of Tony.  They move slowly in his direction.  McClane Looks down the aisle next to the windows.  It leads to a series of cubicles at the other end of the floor and is a clear path if he can make it past Tony. 
82      TONY                                                  82 
He moves steadily toward the area where we saw McClane. 
TONY The fire has been called off, my friend.  No one is coming to help you.  You might as well come out and join the others. (fingers the trigger of his machine gun) I promise not to hurt you. 
Moving more confidently, he steps up to McClane's desk, then around it and fires a blast into the space.  It is empty.  As the SOUND OF THE MACHINE GUN FADES he listens and hears another SOUND -- a NOISE coming from the other end of the room near the cubicles. 
Tony heads toward the noise.  Sensing a trap, he moves past each cubicle carefully, checking each office until he reaches the doorway of the last one.  The sound is just around the partition.  He tenses, then spins into the cubicle. 
83      TONY'S P.O.V.                                         83 
A radial arm saw spins noisily. 
84      TONY                                                  84 
grins at his nervousness.  He moves to turn it off, not realizing the sound has buried the soft rustle of McClane, steps INTO FRAME behind him, McClane shoves his pistol barrel against Tony's temple. 
MCCLANE Freeze, Police...don't move or name your beneficiary. 
Tony doesn't.  McClane cocks his Beretta.  Tony watches him calmly. 
TONY You won't hurt me. 
MCCLANE Yeah?  Why not? 
TONY (smug) Because you are a policeman.  There are rules for policemen. 
MCCLANE Yeah.  My Captain keeps telling me the same thing. 
McClane suddenly PISTOL WHIPS Tony across the head.  Tony REELS, then swallows, worried for the first time. 
MCCLANE Let's go. 
Suddenly Tony spins to the side and McClane FIRES, but the big man's momentum slams McClane into a filing cabinet and sends his pistol into the hall. 
Tony fires his machine gun, but McClane kicks him into the desk. 
He locks his arms around the big man's neck in a hold that sends Tony reeling into the hall.  McClane holds on as they slam through several plastic board partitions.  They careen across the hall into the stairwell door, opening it, and crash into: 
85      STAIRWELL LANDING                                     85 
then down the concrete steps into the wall on the landing below. For a moment, both men lie still.  McClane, still holding onto Tony's neck, releases it and the man's head flops sickeningly to the side. 
For a moment McClane just looks at the dead man.  Then, slowly, methodically, he begins to SEARCH HIM.  He turns all his pockets inside out, looks at his clothing labels, stares long and very hard at a California driver's license with Tony's picture on it.  He expertly examines the machine gun when a HISSING SOUND coming from somewhere attracts his attention. 
He rises, moves cautiously to the source. 
85-A    NEW ANGLE                                             85-A 
It's Tony's CB, which has fallen from the dead man's waist during the struggle.  McClane stares at it, formulating a plan. 
CUT TO: 
86      INT. 32ND FLOOR - NIGHT                               86 
Total darkness. 
92      MCCLANE                                               92 
takes out a coin.  A quarter.  He stops, switches to a nickel. Throws it into the void.  It is a full four seconds until we HEAR it "CHING" and bounce on concrete far below.  You don't have to be a mathematics whiz to know it's a long drop. 
MCCLANE Jesus... 
He moves cautiously around a corner and we SEE a metal ladder leading up to a door marked PUMP ROOM.  Opening the door McClane enters a darkened: 
93      PUMP ROOM                                             93 
damp and full of pipes and goes to another door.  He cracks the door and looks out. 
94      MCCLANE'S P.O.V.                                      94 
The lower level of the roof.  Open and deserted.  Only a heliport above him is higher. 
95      30TH FLOOR (HOSTAGE FLOOR) - HOLLY'S OFFICE - SAME    95 
WIDEN as a FILING CABINET is FLUNG across the floor, drawers SLAMMING out, papers flying.  KARL has done this, and he's    * barely started.  He FLINGS a LAMP against a wall, PUNCHES a hole into the plaster.  Finally, Hans goes to him, lays controlling hands on the man's shoulder. 
HANS I know what you are feeling.  But this is not productive -- 
KARL (pushing him away) He was my only brother...my only family! (a flat statement) I want blood for my blood.  We search...now. 
He starts to move.  Hans stops him. 
HANS (firmly) No.  Heinrich's team must finish planting the detonators...and Theo needs time on the vault.  After the                  * police come they'll waste hours trying to negotiate...that's when we search                 * for this man.  Until then...we do not alter the plan. 
KARL (quietly) And if he alters it...?                              * 
For once Hands doesn't have an answer. 
95-A    HOSTAGES - AROUND THE CORNER                          95-A 
They've heard the alarm, can see and sense the agitation among their captors.  Ellis slides over to Holly. 
ELLIS What's happening? 
HOLLY They don't look happy...something's gone wrong. 
ELLIS The police...? 
HOLLY (shaking her head) John. 
ELLIS John?  Christ, he could fuck this whole thing up...what does he think he's doing? 
HOLLY How about his job? 
ELLIS His 'job' is 3000 miles away.  Without him, they might let us go...at least we have a chance... 
HOLLY (quietly) Tell that to Mr. Takagi. 
96      EXT. ROOF - NIGHT                                     96 
McClane climbs to the heliport and leans against the leeward side of a wall surrounding it.  Shielded from wind, he pulls out the CB, turns to channel nine, and starts broadcasting. 
MCCLANE Mayday, Mayday!  Anyone!  Terrorists have seized and Nakatomi building and are holding 30 or more hostages! I say again -- 
97      OUT                                             OUT   97 
98      INT. HANS' OFFICE - SAME                              98 
Hans, Karl, Fritz and France hear the clear signal over Hans' CB. 
MCCLANE'S VOICE -- unknown number of terrorists, six or more, armed with automatic weapons at Nakatomi, Century City... Somebody answer me, Goddamnit! 
Karl looks almost...satisfied. 
HANS The roof.  It's the best place to transmit. 
They move. 
99      INT. LOS ANGLES EMERGENCY DISPATCH CENTER - SAME      99 
A SUPERVISOR weaves her way back from the break room toward a DISPATCHER who is monitoring the call. 
DISPATCHER It's the same address as that fire signal --                                            * 
SUPERVISOR (frowning) -- the false alarm?  I'll handle                     * it. 
She plugs in her headset.  (Her condescending, arrogant tone is like the one in the famous tape where the dispatch lady spends so much time on red tape that the patient dies.) 
SUPERVISOR (into mike) Attention, whoever you are.  This channel is reserved for emergency calls only -- 
MCCLANE'S VOICE No fucking shit, lady!  Do I sound like I'm ordering a pizza? 
100     OUT                                             OUT  100 
101     INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR - ON KARL - SAME               101 
with Franco and Fritz. 
FRANCO No, but he's in the elevator shaft. 
HANS' VOICE Prefect.  The elevators are locked off.              * He can't escape.  Just shut him in and return to base. 
KARL Hans, he killed by brother -- 
HANS (more firmly) Karl, I know you want him, but the police are probably on their way. Maybe we can convince them it was all a mistake, but not if they hear gunshots! If you lock him in he'll be neutralized -- now do it!  Karl?  Karl! 
Karl turns off his radio.  In the light of their flashlights, the two other terrorists look at Karl in stunned disbelief. He opens the door to the elevator shaft. 
109-B   INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - ON MCCLANE                      109-B 
He's OVERHEARD enough of this to realize he's in deep shit. He backtracks to the air shaft door, strikes a cigarette lighter. 
110-    OUT                                             OUT   110- 
117-A   ELEVATOR SHAFT (OPPOSITE SIDE)                        117-A 
Karl steps off the ladder to the catwalk, his own gun held    * ready. 
118     MCCLANE                                               118 
HEARING Karl's approach, McClane thinks fast, looks down at his narrow confines, and then at: 
118-A   HIS WEAPON                                            118-A 
and its canvas gunsling and metal strap slides. 
118-B   BACK TO SCENE                                         118-B 
Quickly, McClane lets out all the slack in the sling.  Then, he BRACES the weapon across the outside opening of the air shaft door and lowers himself into the: 
119     AIR SHAFT                                             119 
meanwhile holding onto the canvas sling with his elbows bent over it like a kid doing a half-asses skin-the-cat on a swing set. 
His feet slowly move down the smooth aluminum walls until they reach the top of the air duct, then DANGLE in the open space. He straightens his arms to give him length enough to touch the bottom edge of the duct. 
Suddenly he FEELS something GIVE above him and looks up. 
120     CLOSE ON THE SLING                                    120 
It was designed to carry a gun on a man, not vice versa.  The few inches of extra canvas are sliding through the clips. When they're gone...he will be too. 
121     KARL                                                  121 
He moves silently toward the corner. 
122     CLOSE - MCCLANE'S TOES                                122 
now only inches from the bottom edge.  McClane's arms are fully extended now.  He hears Karl on the metal catwalk.  His muscles strain and quiver. 
123     THE SLING                                             123 
One of the canvas end slips through the clip. 
124     ON MCCLANE                                            124 
FALLING.  He grabs the ledge of the air duct as he falls and his body slams into the aluminum wall with an echoing BOOM. Above him on the catwalk the rifle rattles on the metal outside the door. 
125     ON KARL                                               125 
Around the corner Karl FREEZES, unsure of the sound: 
126     ON MCCLANE                                            126 
holding onto the ledge by his hands.  With every ounce of strength he tries to pull himself up into the horizontal duct, clawing for a hold. 
127     ON KARL                                               127 
He rounds the corner and sees McClane's rifle lying beneath the doorway.  He moves to the small door, shines his light and aims his rifle down into the air shaft ready to fire. 
128     HIS P.O.V.                                            128 
The shaft is deserted.  Moving his light around he sees the air duct.  Without hesitation he turns and backtracks to the pump room door. 
129     INT. AIR CONDITIONING DUCT - ON MCCLANE - SAME        129 
He lies exhausted and motionless in the narrow crawl space.  He awkwardly fishes out the lighter from his shirt pocket and thumbs it ON. 
The flickering GLOW shows him this ain't no place for claustrophobics -- it's a long, long long dark and narrow corridor full of weird shadows.  The far end (if there even if one?) is BLACK. 
MCCLANE Whew...for a moment there I was worried. 
He turns out his lighter, and starts crawling. 
130-    OUT                                             OUT   130- 
133-A   INT. MACHINE FLOOR                                    133-A 
The three terrorists rush down from the roof in hot pursuit, Karl leading the way through the door.  Karl points quickly to the left and right where there are a series of rooms.  The others checks these while Karl approaches the CAMERA, trigger finger ITCHING.  Almost immediately, the others return. 
FRANCO (a whisper) Nothing. 
Eddie picks up his CB.  He watches Powell coming up the stairs. 
EDDIE (to CB) Had a feeling you'd be calling... 
HANS' VOICE Let him in. 
Eddie is a little startled, but he moves quickly. 
149-A   ALEXANDER                                             149-A 
also hears this, and his eager expression fades.  But orders are orders. 
150     EXT. FRONT DOOR OF NAKATOMI - SAME                    150 
Powell tries the front doors.  Locked.  Eddie comes hustling across and unlocks the door with the magnetic card. 
EDDIE Evening, officer.  What's up? 
Powell steps in and looks around.  Bland HOLIDAY MUZAK filters from Speakers here.   (LET IT SNOW)                           * 
POWELL We got an emergency call that there was a problem here. 
151     INT. 34TH FLOOR - BOARD ROOM - SAME                   151     * 
McClane makes his way to the Avenue of the Stars side of the building, enters the board room where Takagi was shot. McClane goes to the windows and looks down at the street. 
152     HIS P.O.V.                                            152 
Powell's car. 
MCCLANE All right! 
McClane waits, expectant.  Five seconds.  Ten seconds.  But no commotion, no shouting.  He frowns. 
MCCLANE Where's the fucking cavalry? 
152-A   INT. LOBBY - SAME TIME                                152-A 
Powell walks casually across the slick floor, eyes panning the area.  Eddie sits casually watching a game on one of his monitor screens. 
EDDIE We already had that false alarm, you ask me, the Goddamn computers sent you out on another wild goose chase. They been chasing bugs in that system since they installed it. (to the screen) Oh, shit, come on, I got fifty bucks on you assholes -- ! 
Powell's face shows us he's starting to think he's wasting his time. 
152-B-  OUT                                             OUT   152-B 
153-A   WITH MCCLANE                                          153-A 
The silent tension is driving him crazy. 
MCCLANE Come on, come on...who's in that car, Stevie Wonder? 
He makes up his mind.  He lifts one of the big chairs and swings it at the window.  The tempered glass whitens on the first blow. 
153-B   EXT. ROOF                                            153-B 
James sees the glass whiten below him and shouts into his mike. 
153-C   INT. MACHINE FLOOR                                   153-C 
Heinrich hears the radio and shouts to Marco who grabs his machine gun and runs. 
154     INT. LOBBY                                           154 
Eddie watches confidently as Powell moves through the lobby looking for signs of trouble. 
154-A   AROUND THE CORNER FROM POWELL                        154-A 
Uli is there, gun held ready.                                 * 
155     BOARD ROOM - 34th FLOOR                              155 
McClane draws the chair back for the final hit when a terrorist (MARCO) appears at the door.  Both men react, but Marco already has his gun up.  He FIRES a round at McClane.  The bullets rip into the table top and the chair, and McClane goes down behind the table. 
156-    OUT                                             OUT  156- 156-A                                                        156-A 
157     INT. 34th FLOOR - BOARD ROOM                         157 
Marco smiles and moves around to the other side of the table, but finds no one.  He looks around frantically than squats beneath the table and sees: 
158     MCCLANE                                              158 
lying prone, his pistol trained on him. 
MCCLANE Drop it or you're a rugstain. 
159     BOARD ROOM DOORWAY                                   159 
Just then Heinrich, the terrorist steps into the doorway, sees the situation. 
HEINRICH Marco, duck! 
Marco dives sideways, but Heinrich still isn't quick enough. McClane FIRES TWICE and Heinrich DROPS sprawling in the hallway, machine gun FIRING BLINDLY until he hits the floor. 
THORNBURG Mary, this is Dick.  I want a remote truck and a crew to meet me at the South gate in fifteen minutes... (listens) Damn right, fifteen... (listens) Where are we going? (Hearing gun shots) For an Emmy! 
Now, hearing MACHINE GUN FIRE, Thornburg hangs up the second phone.  Runs out of the room.  CAMERA PANS BACK TO the first phone. 
WOMAN'S VOICE Richard?  Richard? 
167     EXT. CENTURY CITY - NIGHT                            167 
Sirens wail as the first few police cars arrive.  Powell sees them, waves them back, points to the third floor. 
168     INT. HOSTAGE WING - ON ELLIS - SAME                  168 
He leans back and closes his eyes, luxuriating in the sound of WAILING POLICE SIRENS.  He looks at Holly. 
ELLIS I never through I'd love to hear that sound. 
169     HANS' OFFICE                                         169 
Hans, Karl, Fritz and Franco confer. 
HANS (in mid-speech) -- all of you, stay at your posts! We knew that police action was inevitable... (an odd smile) ...In fact, it's necessary.  So let them start their feeble efforts; until them, stay calm.  We have the hostages, remember.  We are still in charge. 
Suddenly Hans' CB crackles to life. 
HANS (picking it up) I told all of you...I want radio silence until further -- 
INTERCUT: 
169-A   MCCLANE - 34th FLOOR - BOARD ROOM                    169-A    * 
He's got a CB on the table and ON, and his cop's notebook is out again.  He's already upgraded the NUMBER OF TERRORISTS? to "12 (?) minus 3 = 9" and added other information.  As he speaks he takes ammo clips the dead men dropped, their sidearms, etc. 
MCCLANE Gee, I'm sorry, Hans, nobody gave me the message.  You shoulda put it on the bulletin board.  Anyway, I thought you and Franco and Karl and the other boys might be lonely, now that I waxed Tony and Marco and their buddy.  So I invited some of the guys from my card game. 
In the office, the terrorists REACT, startled, as McClane name-drops. 
FRANCO                                * How...how does he know so much about -- 
HANS (waving for silence) Ah, how nice of you to call.  I assume you are our mysterious party crasher.  You are most troublesome for a...security guard? 
170     INT. 34th FLOOR - ON MCCLANE - INTERCUT              170      * 
Moving down the corridor.  Now armed with Marco's machine gun and carrying Heinrich's kit bag, he seems more lethal.    * 
MCCLANE (into CB) BZZZ!  Sorry, Hans, wrong guess. Would you like to go for Double Jeopardy, where the stakes are double and the scores really change? 
He rolls Heinrich over and is delighted to find a pack of Gauloise's in the man's pocket.  He takes them, pats the      * dead man's face. 
MCCLANE (sotto, to the body) Bad for your health anyway. 
HANS Who are you, then? 
MCCLANE Just the fly in the ointment, Hans. The monkey in the wrench, the pain in the ass - 
McClane STOPS in mid-speech.  He's just opened the kit bag Heinrich had over his shoulder when he died.  Now McClane takes out the contents...dozens and dozens of EXPLOSIVE DETONATORS marked "DANGER" and a CHUNK of cello-wrapped PLASTIQUE the size of an electric razor.  He WHISTLES in surprise to himself. 
In the office, Hans turns off his mike for a moment, turns to Karl.                                                      * 
HANS Check on all the others...don't use the radio.  See if he's lying about Marco  and find out if anyone                  * else is missing.                                     * 
He moves.   Hans goes back onto the CB.  Meanwhile, McClane   * SMILES at the tell-tale STATIC as Hans goes off and on.  He knows what's happening.  Now, he starts to walk down a corridor, eyes PANNING FROM elevator to the stairwell doors. 
HANS Mr. Mystery Guest.  Are you still there? 
MCCLANE I wouldn't think of leaving, Hans. Unless you want to open the front door...? 
HANS I'm afraid not.  But you have me at a loss -- you know my name, but who are you? (scornfully) Just another American who saw too many movies as a child.  Another orphan of a bankrupt culture who thinks he's John Wayne...Rambo... Marshal Dillion. 
MCCLANE Actually, I was always partial to Roy Rogers.  I really dug those sequined shirts. 
HANS (harsh) Do you really think you have a chance against us, Mr. Cowboy? 
A LIGHT blinks on the elevator. 
MCCLANE (long pause) Yipee-yi-yea...mother-fucker. 
McClane goes quietly through the stairwell door and is gone by the time the search party steps onto this floor. 
Hans sits quietly...thinking. 
170-A   OUT                                             OUT   170-A 
CUT TO: 
171     INT. 30TH FLOOR - SAME                                171 
Karl steps off the elevator and goes through the crowd of hostages to Hans. 
KARL (quietly) He wasn't lying about Marco:  He's thirty stories down on the street. The other man is Heinrich, and I found his body upstairs. (pause; Hans looks alarmed) And his bag is missing. 
HANS He had the detonators! (into CB) Theo?  Theo! 
INTERCUT: 
ROBINSON (puzzled) Then who the hell have you been talking too? 
POWELL We don't exactly know, Sir.  He won't give us him name.  He appears to be the man who called in the report...he's killed one of the terrorists for sure and claims he capped two others. 
ROBINSON (exasperated) He claims?  Powell, has it occured to you he could be one of the terrorists, pulling your chain? Or some kind of nut case who -- 
POWELL I don't think so, Sir.  In fact... I think he's a cop.  Maybe not LAPD, but definitely a badge. 
ROBINSON How do you know? 
POWELL A hunch.  Things he said.  Like, knowing how to recognize a phony ID -- 
ROBINSON (exasperated) -- recognizing phony ID's?  Christ, Powell, he could be a fucking bartender for all we know! 
Something draws Robinson's attention.  He looks at: 
178     HIS P.O.V. - REMOTE NEWS TRUCK                        178 
Pulling up and parking just beyond the barricades. Richard Thornburg gets out, starts supervising the            * positioning of cameras. 
178-A   BACK TO SCENE                                         178-A 
ROBINSON Oh shit... 
179     HOSTAGE FLOOR                                         179 
Hans examines building plans at Holly's desk.  Behind him the TV is ON, the sound muted.  TV cops triumph over oafish bad guys. 
Hans looks up as Fritz brings in Holly. 
HOLLY I...have a request. 
HANS Oh?  What idiot put you in charge? 
HOLLY (evenly) You did. (on his look) You murdered by Boss.  Now... (waving towards the hostages) They're looking to me.  Personally I'd pass on the jab.  I don't enjoy being this close to you. 
Hans is impressed by her candor.  And she's easy enough on the eyes. 
HANS Go on. 
HOLLY We have a pregnant woman out there -- (on his look) -- relax, she's not due for two weeks, but a marble floor isn't doing her back any good.  I'd like permission for her to more to one of the offices where there's a sofa. 
HANS No.  But I'll have a sofa brought out to you.  Good enough? 
HOLLY Good enough.  And unless you like is messy, you'd better start taking us in groups to the bathroom. 
HANS (nods) Yes, you're right.  It will be done. 
He nods to one of his men, and she is waved to the door: 
As she goes: 
HANS Mr. Takagi chose his people well, Mrs...? 
HOLLY Gennero.  Miss Gennero. 
He nods, thoughtful.  She goes out.  Hans suddenly notices: 
180     CLOSER - TV                                          180 
A slide "SPECIAL BULLETIN" has appeared.  This changes to a SHOT of the Nakatomi building with "LIVE" supered over it. Richard Thornburg is in front. The CAMERA TIGHTENS ON him. 
THORNBURG This is Richard Thornburg, speaking to you live from Century City... where Los Angeles has joined the sad but world wide fraternity whose only membership requirement is the awesome spectre of International Terrorism... 
181     ANOTHER TV SCREEN - NIGHT                            181 
As Thornburg Continues, we PULL BACK.  We're WITH Argyle in the back seat of the limo. 
ARGYLE (reaching for the remote) What else is new...? 
The CAMERA PULLS BACK and we SEE the Nakatomi Building rise up in the b.g. behind Thornburg. 
ARGYLE (stunned) Holy shit... 
THORNBURG We're told that the situation began some two hours ago when an unidentified party of men took over the building and sealed off all of its entrances and exits... 
Argyle is already bailing out of the car. 
182     EXT. LIMO - IN THE GARAGE                            182 
Argyle looks at the metal gates, swallows.  He JUMPS back in the car. 
183     BACK INSIDE                                          183 
Argyle pours himself a stiff drink. 
THORNBURG (on TV) Since all the telephone lines have been cut, the only contact with the building had been through the use of CB communicators which the terrorists brought with them.  Strangely enough, so far the terrorists have not communicated directly with the police... but an unidentified man has had several conversations which seem to indicate... 
Argyle nearly spills his drink as he leans over the front seat and turns on the CB. 
CUT TO: 
184     OUTSIDE THE BUILDING - SAME TIME                     184 
193     ANGLE ON TWO SWAT OFFICERS                            193 
Mitchell and Robinson watch from behind the cover of a police car as the SWAT officers remove a portable welding torch and begin cutting their way through the locks. 
194     INT. 33RD FLOOR - MCCLANE                             194 
He moves painfully to the window and looks out.  He can't see a thing because of the lights. 
MCCLANE (to himself) No... 
195     EXT. POLICE BARRICADES - ON MITCHELL AND ROBINSON     195 
Suddenly rifle fire sounds from the building. 
ROBINSON (worriedly) They're shooting at them 
MITCHELL (calmly) It's panic fire...they can't see anything. 
POWELL (under breath) They're shooting at the lights. 
More shots ring out from the building going over the SWAT officers' heads and suddenly the huge dome of one of the spotlights shatters behind Mitchell and Robinson's head. The glow fades.  A moment later the next light twenty feet away dies. 
ROBINSON They're going after the lights! 
The two SWAT officers cutting the garage ate suddenly look up as their cover starts to disappear. 
ROBINSON Call them back. 
MITCHELL No, they're almost in. 
Suddenly the third and fourth lights are shot out and the SWAT men become sitting ducks. 
196     IN HOLLY'S OFFICE - HANS                              196 
He calmly speak into his CB. 
HANS Don't get impatient.  Just wound them. 
197     INT. LOBBY                                            197 
Eddie and Uli fire.  They hit one of the officers in the leg, the second one in the arm. 
198     EXT. POLICE BARRICADES - ON MITCHELL AND ROBINSON     198 
MITCHELL (on radio) Send in the car! 
An armored car wheels toward the building and starts toward the wounded men. 
199     INT. ROOF-MACHINE ROOM/SERVICE ELEVATOR - SAME        199 
JAMES and Alexander quickly load two crates onto the service elevator and push the button for the 3rd floor.  As the car starts down, they remove an anti-tank gun from one of the crates. 
200     WITH THEO - WATCHING SCREENS                          200 
THEO Well, what have we here.  The police've got themselves an R.V. James, Alexander, southeast corner. 
201     INT. 3RD FLOOR - SAME                                 201 
The service elevator arrives on the 3rd floor and James and Alexander move across the room toward the windows with the anti-tank weapon.  At the window, they prepare the weapon for use. 
Outside the window the armored car has stopped in front of the wounded man and paramedics quickly load them in from the sheltered side of the vehicle.  Alexander quickly sights on the armored car. 
ALEXANDER (to Hans, CB) I have them 
HANS' VOICE (o.s., over CB) Fire. 
202     EXT. THE ARMORED CAR                                  202 
A blast ROARS from the third floor window and the shell hits the armored car.  The car pitches forward like a beast whose front legs have been shot out from under it -- its front axle destroyed, unable to move.  Alexander looks back at James and grins. 
203     30TH FLOOR - HANS                                     203 
He watches from his window.  Coldly picks up his CB. 
HANS Hit it again. 
204     MCCLANE                                               204 
listening.  He picks up his CB. 
MCCLANE Hans, you motherfucker, you've made your point.  Let them pull back! 
HANS' VOICE Thank you Mr. Cowboy, I'll take it under advisement.  His it again. 
McClane slumps to the floor below the window.  He feels helpless, then notices his kit bag. 
205     3RD FLOOR                                             205 
James runs back to the crate on the elevator. 
206     EXT. POLICE BARRICADE - ON ROBINSON AND MITCHELL      206 
They look on in horror as the armored car sits helplessly on fire.  On the police radio channel we HEAR the screams of men inside. 
MCCLANE Two?  Are you sure? 
Before Powell can answer Robinson comes running up to him. 
ROBINSON Is that him? 
POWELL Yessir. 
ROBINSON (reaching for Powell's CB) Give me that. (angrily at McClane) Now, listen to me, mister, I don't know what you think you're doing, but demolishing a building doesn't fall under the definition of 'help'! There's hundreds of people out here and you covered half of them in pieces of glass -- 
MCCLANE Glass, my ass!  Who the fuck is this? 
ROBINSON This is Deputy Chief of Police Dwayne T. Robinson, and I'm in charge of this situation. 
McClane leans tiredly against the elevator door. 
MCCLANE Well, from up here, it looks like you're in charge of shit, Dwayne. I haven't seen such a fucked up operation since the Bride of Frankenstein.  Ask the guys in the armored car if they minded a little flying glass. 
ROBINSON Listen asshole -- ! 
MCCLANE (exploding) Asshole?  I'm not the one who just for butt fucked on national TV, Dwayne!  Now if you're not part of the solution, stop being part of the problem!  Get off the Goddamn radio and put Al back on! 
McClane is so furious, he's out of breath. 
226     INT. LIMO - ARGYLE - SAME                            226 
Argyle nods in agreement. 
ARGYLE Tell 'em, Mr. Mac!  Tell 'em! 
227     INT. 33RD FLOOR - ON MCCLANE                         227 
still seething.  There is a long pause on the CB, then: 
POWELL'S VOICE Hello, Roy.  How're you feeling? 
MCCLANE (pissed) Pretty fucking unappreciated. 
INTERCUT: 
228     ON POWELL                                            228 
Other officers, including Robinson, monitor the conversation. 
POWELL Hey, I love you. (looking around) So do a lot of the guys.  So hang in there, man.  Hang in there. 
MCCLANE (tired, touched) Thanks...partner. 
229     TV - CLOSE                                           229 
As it SNAPS ON.  We're in the studio set. 
GAIL (as the picture stabilizes) ...of the Nakatomi building, sources say that the terrorist leader 'Hans' may be this man, Hans Gruber. 
A SLIDE of Hans appears behind her.  At the same time, the CAMERA PULLS BACK.  We realize we're on THE HOSTAGE FLOOR, and Hans has just turned on the set out here for his "guests".  He smiles modestly as they "recognize" him from the on air shot, returns to the office. 
GAIL (on TV) A member of the radical West German Volksfrei movement. Strangely, the Volksfrei leadership issued a communique an hour ago stating that Gruber has been expelled from the organization and is operating on his own. 
HARVEY (on TV) Obviously, Gail whatever his affiliation, it's safe to say that Gruber's terrorist actions in Los Angeles tonight are well, terroristic... 
As the bullshit continues, Ellis suddenly STANDS, head towards the terrorist "office".  Immediately the chief guard here, Fritz, moves to intercept Ellis. 
HOLLY Where are you going? 
ELLIS I'm tired of sitting here waiting to see who gets us killed first... them...or your husband. (to the approaching Fritz) Hi there. 
HOLLY (worried) What are you going to do? 
ELLIS Hey, I negotiate million dollar deals for breakfast.  I can handle these clowns. (to Fritz) I want to talk to Hans.  Hans! Sprickenzie talk? 
He doesn't wait for an answer.  Fritz follows him.  Holly worries. 
230     THE OFFICE                                           230 
KARL (in mid-speech, angry) -- you wouldn't let me kill him when I had the chance -- 
HANS If you'd listened to me he would be neutralized already! 
KARL I don't want neutral...I want dead -- 
ALL TURN at a rap on the door.  Ellis is there. 
ELLIS Hope I'm not interrupting...? 
HANS (to Fritz) What does he want? 
As Fritz shrugs: 
ELLIS It's not what I want, it's what I can give you.  Look, let's be straight, okay?  It's obvious you're not some dumb thug up here to snatch a few purses, am I right? 
Karl looks at Ellis and then at Hans, as if to say, let me plug this asshole right now.  But Hans is either amused of curious or bored enough to shake his head, turn back to Ellis. 
HANS (politely) You're very perceptive. 
ELLIS' VOICE John, didn't you hear me? 
MCCLANE (to CB, quietly) Yeah, I hear you, you fucking moron! 
ELLIS John, I think you could get with the program a little.  The police are here now.  It's their problem. Tell these guys where the detonators are so no one else gets hurt.  Hey, I'm putting my life on the line for you buddy... 
MCCLANE Don't you think I know that!  Put Hans on!  Hans, listen to me, that shithead doesn't know what kind of scum you are, but I do -- 
HANS Good.  Then you'll give us what we want and save your friend's life. You're not part of this equation. It's time to realize that. 
Saying this, Hans takes out his gun, points it at Ellis, smiling. Ellis smiles, too. 
ELLIS What am I, a method actor?  Hans, babe, put away the gun.  This is radio, not television... 
MCCLANE That asshole's not my friend! I barely know him!  I hate his fucking guts -- (desperately sincere) -- Ellis, for Christ's sake, tell him you don't mean shit to me -- 
ELLIS John, how can you say that, after all these years--?  John?  John? 
Ellis looks at Hans and shrugs, "Well, I tried..." Hans nods understandingly.  He takes the CB, presses the TALK button, and in one frighteningly smooth motion brings the Walther up to Ellis' forehead and PULLS THE TRIGGER. 
CUT TO: 
237     INT. 33RD FLOOR - MCCLANE                            237

238     30TH FLOOR - HOLLY AND HOSTAGES                      238 
She lowers her head sadly.  Around her, the others go CRAZY as they SEE Ellis' blood splattered on the glass walls on Hans' office. 
239     INT. HANS' OFFICE - ON HANS                         239 
He throws open the door to let McClane and the police hear the screams of the hostages. 
HANS Hear that?  Talk to me, where are my detonators.  Where are they or shall I shoot another one?  Sooner or later... (taking a shot) ...I might get to someone you do care about. 
MCCLANE (after a beat) Go fuck yourself. 
He DISCONNECTS. 
240     EXT. BUILDING                                       240 
Powell fends off Robinson, who wants the CB. 
ROBINSON Goddamn, didn't you hear him!  He practically pulled the Goddamned trigger himself -- he gave that man to them -- 
POWELL Christ, can't you read between the lines!  He did everything he could to save him...if he gave himself up they'd both be dead! 
ROBINSON Maybe.  And maybe they'd at least be talking to us!  Now tell your 'partner' to stay out of it, or so help me if he lives through this I'll put him behind bars myself! 
POWELL (amused) He's alone, tired, hunted, and hasn't seen diddly-squat from us and you think he gives a flying fuck about what you're going to do to him? Robinson, wake up and smell the shit you're shoveling! 
ROBINSON (cold) Anytime you want to go home, Sergeant...consider yourself dismissed. 
They lock eyes. 
POWELL No Sir.  You couldn't drag me away. 
HANS' VOICE (over CB) Attention police.  Attention police. 
It's asses and elbows time.  Tape recorders are started. 
POWELL (starting to speak) This is -- 
ROBINSON (taking the CB away) This is Deputy Chief Robinson.  Who is this? 
INTERCUT: 
241     HANS' OFFICE                                         241 
HANS This is Hans Gruber.  I assume you realize the futility of direct action against me.  We have no wish for further loss of life. 
ROBINSON What do you wish for, Mister Gruber? 
HANS I have comrades in arms around the world who are languishing in prison. The American State Department enjoys rattling its saber to its own ends... now it can rattle it for me. 
INTERCUT: 
242     MCCLANE                                              242 
Listening to this with expressions ranging from astonishment to dismay to outright derisive amusement. 
HANS' VOICE ...The following people are to be released from their captors:  In Northern Ireland, the seven members of the New Provo Front.  In Canada, the five imprisoned leaders of Liberte de Quebec... 
243     HANS' OFFICE                                         243 
HANS ...in Sri Lanka, the nine members of the Asian Dawn movement... 
KARL (sotto) 'Asian Dawn Movement?' 
HANS (off-mike, a shrug) I read about them in Time magazine. (on mike) When these Revolutionary Brothers and Sisters are Free, the hostages in this building will be taken to the roof and they will accompany us in helicopters to the Los Angeles International Airport where you will be given further instructions.  You have two hours to comply. 
ROBINSON Two hours?  Are you insane?  I can't authorize...hello?  Hello? 
As Robinson REACTS, we GO TO: 
257     THE MECHANICAL FLOOR - TIGHT ON HANS                   257 
He checks the plastique, not pleased.  He turns, DROPS to the floor. 
258     LOW ANGLE                                              258 
He lands, knees bent...looks directly at a PAIR OF BARE FEET. A GUN BARREL DROPS INTO THE SHOT close to his head. 
MCCLANE Lost? 
259     NEW ANGLE                                              259 
A moment.  And then Hans turns, looks up. 
The transformation in his expression and bearing are mind- boggling.  Hands shaking, eyes filled with fear, he swallows, looks up at McClane and in a perfect American accent says: 
HANS --ohGodplease -- don't kill me -- don't kill me -- you're one of them, I know it -- 
MCCLANE (thrown, unsure) Whoa, whoa, easy man.  I won't hurt you.  Who are you?  What are you looking for? 
Hans' eyes dart towards: 
260     THE BUTTRESS TEN FEET AWAY                             260 
Where a tiny piece of his gun sticks out, barely visible. 
261     BACK TO SCENE                                          261 
HANS A way up to the roof...I thought I could signal for help -- 
He starts in that direction. 
MCCLANE Forget it.  They got a guy up there. You want to stay alive, keep moving. Hey?  You hear me? 
Hans realizes this tack won't work.  He follows McClane. 
HANS You...you're an American? 
MCCLANE (friendly, easing the man's fears) Only if New Jersey counts. 
It works.  The poor frightened civilian shows a hint of a smile. 
CUT TO: 
261-A   OUTSIDE BUILDING                                       261-A 
ROBINSON (in mid-speech to FBI) We've got thirty, maybe thirty-five hostages, probably on the 30th floor... seven, maybe eight terrorists. 
LITTLE JOHNSON (to Big Johnson) Sounds like a standard A-7 scenario. 
Big Johnson nods in agreement, turns to Robinson. 
BIG JOHNSON Thank you.  We'll handle it from here.  When we need to commandeer your men, we'll try and let you know. 
He starts to move away with his partner. 
POWELL (angry) Aren't you forgetting something? 
Johnson and Johnson turn.  Robinson wants Powell to shut up. 
BIG JOHNSON Such as...? 
POWELL (pointing to the building) John McClane!  He's the man who gave us all the information we've got! He's the reason you're facing seven terrorists instead of twelve. 
LITTLE JOHNSON He's inside?  Who is he? 
ROBINSON (nodding) He may be a cop...we're checking on that -- 
BIG JOHNSON One of yours? 
ROBINSON (too quickly) No, sir. 
BIG JOHNSON (after a moment) If he's not a terrorist, and he's not a hostage...he's just not part of the equation. 
They start to walk away. 
POWELL (indignant) T...that's the same Goddamn thing the terrorists said! 
LITTLE JOHNSON (interested) Really? (to Big Johnson) That's one good thing.  Sound like we're dealing with pros. 
They leave. 
CUT TO: 
262     THE COMPUTER FLOOR                                     262 
McClane and Hans walk together.  Hans is still a "nervous wreck." 
HANS (nodding) There was a party -- celebration -- all of a sudden they were there -- shooting -- threatening us -- 
263     CLOSER SHOT                                            263 
275     FRANCO                                               275 
McClane's bullets RAKE his middle, throw him over a desk, his weapon FLYING: 
276     CLOSER                                               276 
He SLIDES right into a glass door.  It smashes around his head. Bright arterial BLOOD fountains up: 
277     MCCLANE                                              277 
hope rising at the prospect of an equal battle, his face suddenly FALLS as BULLETS fly in from an unexpected direction. He turns: 
278     HANS                                                 278 
has reappeared and snatched up Franco's weapon. 
279     MCCLANE                                              279 
FIRES, moving, trying to keep from bring flanked.  One of his shots SHATTERS a glass panel, raining down shards near Hans, who escapes with only superficial scratches. 
280     HANS                                                 280 
looks at the glass around him, gets an idea.  He SHOUTS to Karl in German: 
HANS The glass!  Shoot the glass! 
And, saying this, he demonstrates.  Karl follows suit. 
281     MCCLANE                                              281 
as GLASS FLIES EVERYWHERE, McClane sees one option, takes it. BLASTING a burst to keep their heads down, he WHIRLS, JUMPS on top of a long counter and RUNS ACROSS THE ROOM.  Their BULLETS follow him, six inches behind his moving form!  Big CRAY UNITS GROAN with electronic SQUEALS and SPARKS as a million Gigabytes goes to RAM heaven.  McClane reaches the end of the counter, DIVES and rolls to the floor: 
282     HIS FOOT                                             282 
goes right down on a jagged SHARD.  He GROANS, keeps going: 
283     STAIRWELL DOOR                                       283 
He's out, gone, safe! 
284     BACK TO SCENE                                        284 
Karl looks pissed as hell.  Behind him, Hans sifts through rubble, then comes over, smiling. 
He's holding the bag of detonators. 
HANS Smile, Karl.  We are back in business.

Mary comes inside, grinning ear to ear.  Thornburg looks up from his danish, a cute little chin napkin protecting his shirt collar. 
THORNBURG You got something? 
MARY (waving a paper) Just McClane's name, badge number, police record, vital statistics... (the ringer) ...And his family's address right here in L.A. 
As Thornburg GRINS we GO TO: 
286     HOSTAGE FLOOR                                         286 
Eddie and Uli are guarding the hostages.  Hans and Karl return. Hans tosses the bag of detonators to Uli, who grins, leaves.

Theo and Kristoff and Hans huddle over the computer monitor screen as if it was a warm fireplace.  Theo points to the computer screen; all they can do is wait. 
We HEAR the HUMM of a portable generator.  The lights go OFF. The computer screen stays ON.  Theo looks over at the safe. 
300     SAFE LED READOUT                                      300

LITTLE JOHNSON Shit! (turning, to the Engineer) Cut it again.  Go wider. 
ENGINEER I can't go wider here... (to Robinson, looking for help) ...I'd have to call downtown have them take down one of the city grids...you're talking ten square block -- 
ROBINSON -- ten blocks? (to Big Johnson) Are you crazy?  It's Christmas Eve, thousands of people -- the Mayor'll scream bloody murder -- 
BIG JOHNSON (ignoring Robinson, to the Engineer) We must shut down the building.  Go wider --! 
ENGINEER I need authorization -- 
BIG JOHNSON Authorization?  How about the United States Fucking Government? Lose the grid or lose your job! 
The engineer looks at Robinson.  No help.  The engineer looks at his guy in the manhole, shrugs.  No choice. 
ENGINEER (takes phone) Central.  This is Walt, out at Nakatomi.  I want you to shut down grid 212. (listens) No shit, it's my ass.  Just shut it down now. 
Pause...pause...AND THEN THE FLOORS OF THE BUILDING ALL GO OUT AGAIN.

HANS This is Hans... 
BIG JOHNSON This is Agent Johnson of the FBI. The State Department has arranged for the release of your comrades.  The helicopters you requested are on the way. 
MCCLANE -- there won't be shit for those helicopters to land on, because the whole top of this building is wired with explosives!  Now get below -- 
SECOND HOSTAGE But...we're safe up here -- 
MCCLANE Safe, my ass!  This ain't a helipad, it's a launching pad!

McClane herds the last of the hostages inside, starts for the door himself, when with a ROAR and a CHATTER of rotors, the lead chopper zooms overhead!  McClane throws himself down on the ground, looks up as the chopper banks in a tight turn and then from the open side GUNFIRE erupts!  Shocked, McClane DIVES out of the way of the bullets that stitch across the door. 
349     HOSTAGES - ON LOWER FLOORS (OR IN STAIRWELL)          349 
descending, SCREAMING and HOWLING as a chopper SWEEPS past a window on a loop back towards the roof. 
350     IN THE CHOPPER                                        350 
Both Johnsons FIRE AWAY 
BIG JOHNSON Bank and we'll nail him! 
351     THE VAULT ROOM                                        351 
Hans whirls towards Kristoff. 
HANS Blow the roof.  Now! 
KRISTOFF But Karl and Uli are up there -- 
CAMERA ADJUSTS to show the remote detonator on a table.  Hans goes to it. 
352     THE ROOF                                              352 
McClane DIVES away from another burst. 
MCCLANE You assholes, I'm on your side -- ! 
They come in on another pass.  Desperate, he looks around, see a fire hose.  Makes up his mind.  With the chopper LOOMING UP behind him, he slings Uli's weapon, runs to the fire hose, unreels three yards, loops it around his back and under his legs. He looks over the edge, hesitates: 
MCCLANE Fuck this... 
Bullets HIT all around him.  He JUMPS: 
353     THE VAULT ROOM                                        353 
Hans extends the antenna...HITS the button. 
354     LONG SHOT - THE ROOF                                  354 
The helipad EXPLODES!  A FIREBALL rolls into the sky. 
355     THE HOSTAGES                                          355 
lose their footing on the floor.  Dust and debris fall down, but they're okay. 
356     JOHNSON AND JOHNSON'S CHOPPER                         356 
STRAINS to avoid the rising fireball...can't!  It's CAUGHT in the explosion!  It tips over, a rotor hits the roof -- it CRASHES, EXPLODES, tumbles down the side of the building! 
357     MCCLANE                                               357 
Dangling against the side of the building, he DUCKS and winces as FLAMING DEBRIS soar past him. 
358     THE ROOF - HOSE WHEEL DEVICE                          358 
Flame ROARS TOWARDS it, engulfs it.  It JERKS on its foundation PIVOTS 180 degrees as several bolts slip: 
MCCLANE (under his breath) Shit... 
He checks his Baretta.  One bullet.  He thinks, desperate. Decides.  He takes the bullet from the rifle clip, adds it to the Baretta clip.  He slams the pistol clip back, really worried. Mind racing, he looks all around the room...his eyes fall on a tape dispenser.  He thinks again...steps towards it: 
380-A   IN THE BASEMENT                                       380-A 
Theo has pulled two ramps out from the truck and slips into the back.  A car engine fires up inside the delivery truck. 
381     ARGYLE                                                381 
Realization dawning, he vaults into the front seat. 
382     THE GARAGE                                            382 
A paramedic van shoots out of the back of the Pacific Courier delivery truck.  Flooring the limo, Argyle CRASHES into the van, which CAREENS into the wall. 
383     CLOSER                                                383 
Theo staggers out in time for Argyle to deck him with one punch. 
ARGYLE (looking around) Where's the camera when you need them? 
CUT TO: 
384     THE VAULT ROOM                                        384 
HANS Let's move. 
The last of the money is piled on.  Hans hangs onto Holly while Eddie pushes the mail carts of moneybags.  Kristoff goes to the door to scope their escape...suddenly he is COLD COCKED by a rifle butt. 
385     WIDER                                                 385 
McClane steps into view in the doorway, backlit by sparks still tumbling down from the roof above.  He holds the machine gun ready. 
MCCLANE Hans! 
Hans turns, not that surprised.  Grinning, he yanks Holly into view.  No words need be said. 
HOLLY John! 
MCCLANE Holly, we have to stop meeting like this. (taking in the vault) So that's what it was.  A fucking robbery. (thinking) So why nuke the building, Hans? 
HANS (with a shrug) When you steal six hundred dollars, you can disappear...but when you steal six hundred million, they will find you...unless you play dead. (tight smile) Which happens to be your next role... drop your gun, please. 
McClane hesitates...Hans pushes the gun against Holly again, really hurting her.  Eddie quickly raises his weapon. 
HANS (to Eddie) Nein, dies ein ist mein. (to McClane) This time John Wayne does not walk off into the sunset with Grace Kelly. 
MCCLANE That was Gary Cooper, shithead... 
HANS No more jokes, drop it or she gets it between the eyes! 
MCCLANE (slowly putting down his gun) Whoa, Hans, now you're the cowboy? 
HANS 'Yippe-ki-yea, mother fucker'?  Now you are fucked. 
He aims: 
MCCLANE Holly, now...! 
Instantly, Holly sidesteps, JABS her elbow into Hans' face! 
386     MCCLANE - OVER SHOULDER SHOT                          386 
At the same moment Holly moves, McClane grabs his Baretta from its hiding place TAPED TO THE BACK OF HIS NECK, SHOOTS Hans high in the chest! 
The bullet passes right THROUGH Hans, and the WINDOW behind him SPLATTERS with blood and SHATTERS.  Even while this is happening, McClane SPINS: 
387     EDDIE - THROUGH MCCLANE'S WIDESPREAD LEGS             387 
Eddie takes a gunshot, DROPS just like on Gunsmoke. 
388     BACK TO SCENE                                         388 
Hans drops his weapon, staggers, looks down at his own blood in shock. 
389     MCCLANE                                               389 
MCCLANE You were right about us Americans. (he blows smoke from his pistol barrel) We are cowboys. 
390     VAULT ROOM - WIDER                                    390 
Incredibly, Hans still stands, eyes filled with shock and disbelief.  He REELS, falls against the windowsill, starts to TOPPLE -- and then he GRITS his teeth and from some inward place finds a last reserve of strength and he GRABS: 
391     HOLLY'S WRIST                                         391 
and she is YANKED off her feet! 
392     BACK TO SCENE                                         392 
Hans goes out the window, pulling Holly with him!  McClane LEAPS forward, catches her inside arm near the elbow at the last minute!

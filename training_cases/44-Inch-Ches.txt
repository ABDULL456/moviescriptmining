44 INCH CHEST 
Written by

PROLOGUE 
Stagnant black water ... Greasy. Pitch. Thick. Oily. Dense. Heavy... Lapping... Slow.... A desolate canal... Night. 
Onto dark stones... rain-slicked... darkest slate-grey cobbles... 
And on through streets... Narrow.        Grimy.     Sooty.   Rank... Deserted... 
Pastal-disused Victorian broken-windowed, derelict buildings and wharf side warehouses with rotten oaky loading beams and rusted iron chains... Mossy, mildewed walls... Dripping fetid water from corroded dilapidated ancient ruined guttering... 
Moving... Turning... Into a pinched, arched, alleyway -- If anything darker, blacker... Foreboding... Forsaken... 
And if we listen -- If we strain our ears -- listen -- we can hear music -- faint. Ghostly. Haunting ... "Take Me Back To Dear Ol' Blighty " as if sung by a jolly girl in a long gone bar surrounded by drunken men... 
We keep moving... The music growing... In the distance a faint glow.... Dirty-yellow, diffused, misty light... We move towards it... Towards the piss-coloured light... 
We stop... In the middle of nowhere... Dark nowhere... and the music fades... Fades away... Vanished... Extreme silence... All we have is all we can see... 
The gable end of an old house.... Limey-light bleeding weakly from a broken, filthy window... All is still -- suddenly it comes crashing down -- the end wall comes crashing down - a flurry of bricks and mortar... Crashing down... The tumble of masonry... And through clouds of brick-dust and rubble we see figures inside... Through a smokey powdered fog we can see a group of men in the downstairs room of the derelict house... 
On the walls faded 40's wallpaper, peeling in parts to reveal older dim patterns... damp patches... A window crudely boarded up... A few unmatched armchairs in various states of disrepair -- a 60's black vinyl, a deco-patterned smoker, a 70's cream plastic, a brown wooden kitchen chair etc... The colours in the room are browns, greys, caramels, darks, muted... 
In the middle of the room, standing on dusty, bare wooden floorboards, his fist clenched aggressively by his sides, is OLD MAN PEANUT, aged 80... Skinny... Wearing a dark three piece suit... Gold watch chain... Black Homburg... He is squaring up to us... Staring... 
CONTINUED: (2) 
Slightly behind, to his left, sitting nonchalantly cross- legged in a battered brown leather wingback armchair and casually smoking a Davidoff cigarette, is MEREDITH, late 40's... Suave... Immaculate... Wearing black handmade boots, black Saville Row suit, black cashmere roll neck sweater, herring bone overcoat with a black velvet collar, brown leather gloves, his jet-black hair is heavily brilliantined.... Behind him an old wardrobe... 
Standing with his back three quarters to us, and leaning on a broken, chipped, mantelpiece over a smashed tiled fireplace is ARCHIE, aged 52... Big... Avuncular... Wearing a car coat and casual nondescript clothes... he is pouring himself a Captain Morgan's rum from a bottle into a polystyrene cup... He sort of sees us -- is not fussed -- drinks... 
Standing at the back of the room, in front of a door which             * has at some time been on fire, (it's yellowing, tobacco-ey paint charred and blistered), is MAL, aged mid-40's... Wearing a silver-grey suit, white shirt, duck-egg blue silk tie... 
There is another man in the room but we do not see his face -- for he s its slu mpe d, h ead in his han ds in o ne of t he armchairs - a picture of despair. He wears an olive green shirt, brown trousers, maroon braces... This is COLIN, aged late 40's... 
CUT TO 
Blackness and silence... 
In the silent black an outsize boot appears - scuffed and tatty... Attached to skinny legs in black tights... The legs gangle and flip pulling into view a bony, pasty, bare torso which is undulating oddly -- and here comes the head! - Long, lank, shoulder length hair... Dripping from a white domed pate - The face poker straight in contrast to the comedic body- antics -- A grave-grey face -- Fleshy, bulbous, rubbery... Ladies and Gentlemen -- MAX WALL! 
He goon-walks about for a bit in the black space... Baboon- bottomed... As if knees tied together... Aflickin' and akickin' his clown boots... His unhappy face... Like death... Prancing... Ridiculous dancing... Absurd... 
Giant C/U on his morose contorted phizzog... 
MAX (Directly to us... darkly) ...Evenin'!

ARCHIE (concerned) You alright, Col? 
But COLIN is sobbing... quietly sobbing... sobbing his heart out... ARCHIE looks in the rear view mirror at MAL... Who in turn looks to MEREDITH who calmly smokes raising an eyebrow... Now the van swings into a cul-de-sac, headlights illuminating a row of tatty garages and picking out OLD MAN PEANUT who stands there stony-faced... MAL opens the rear door... OLD MAN PEANUT clambers in... ARCHIE throws the van into reverse and takes off again....

We are with ARCHIE overseeing the 'operation'... Staff terrified... Customers alarmed... ARCHIE wheels round wielding an outsize pepper grinder like a club... Crash/zoom in on him...

LOVERBOY with his eyes shut ... COLIN, upset, opposite... 
COLIN Away from you!! ... (TURNING to THE ROOM) Away from him!! 
He turns...and we now see the others back in the room ... But... LIZ's head is on MEREDITH'S body she smokes ... MEREDITH'S head is on ARCHIE'S body he leans on the mantelpiece ... ARCHIE'S head is on MAL's body standing ... MAL's head is OLD MAN PEANUT's body sitting... 
C/U on COLIN'S face ... He can't believe it ... Addresses the MEREDITH/LIZ person 
COLIN (CONT'D) (Perplexed) What's 'appenin', Meredith? 
But this figure does not reply ... The response comes from the LIZ/MEREDITH combo... 
LIZ/MEREDITH (But with Old Man Peanut's voice) Oh, I'm not Meredith! 
OMP (but with ARCHIE,s gruff voice) Oh, gawd! ! 
COLIN confused ... Fascinated ... Scared ... Especially by the relaxed, cross legged, smoking, sexy-bodied, feminine form disturbingly topped with the nasty old head of OLD MAN PEANUT ... it speaks... 
ARCHIE Why's that? 
MEREDITH Gardener fucks the maid! 
ARCHIE Sounds alright! 
MEREDITH You ain't seen the maid! 
ARCHIE Be alright, I'll be wearin' muddy gloves!

MEREDITH smiles... Eventually looks at COLIN.                             * 
MEREDITH                                           * You? Well, Colin, since you ask...                           * you're the thing in the basement...                          * with the hood on... ain't he Peanut?                         *

We are at the foot of the stairs ... can hear footsteps descending ... and now OLD MAN PEANUT appears ... carrying a battered old suitcase ... he opens the heavy, wooden, studded, creaking, dungeon door and enters ... we see a figure, trussed up in bin bags and with an old Tesco bag on its head hanging from a meat-hook ... it struggles...OLD MAN PEANUT slams down the case ... opens it ... inside a jumbled variety of rusty tools /gadgets/ implements.... from the tangled hardware he manages to extract a thick, rusty file ... an ancient heavy plane...a mallet-and a six inch nail ... uttering to himself... 
OMP This is gonna 'urt you much more than its gonna'urt me!... I feel for ya, I really don't... (turns and addresses the hanging figure). You're mincemeat, mate! - 'Mincemeat!

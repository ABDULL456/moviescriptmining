The Hollow Man 
written by Andrew W. Marlowe Red Wagon Prods. Revised Draft 
FADE IN: On complete darkness. A SMALL DOOR swings open. A circle of light reveals that we I re looking down the length of a tube. At the far end of the tube, we see a gloved hand dangling a rat. The hand shoves the frightened rat into the tube and closes the door behind it. The rat s stark white fur bristles and it begins to pad down the tube s length. After several feet, the tube opens up into a dimly lit cubicle. The rat hesitates and stops. The SOUNDS of gentle BREATHING whispers in the rat s ears. The rat turns round to head back down the tube, but a door swings shut, trapping it in the cubicle. The rat cowers as the BREATHING turns to SNORTING. The rat s head jerks around, looking for signs of danger, but the cubicle is empty. The rat sees a water dish on the far side of the cubicle - a place to hide - and dashes toward it. But an invisible force descends. The rat squeals in agony as something smashes down on its body, crushing it. A LOUD BELLOW rings out, and the rat flies into the air, halting a few feet off the ground. Its body writhes, struggling against the unholy force. Then a sick crunch of tiny bones snapping. All life quickly drains from the levitating body. Dead eyes... The creature s corpse floats in mid-air. Then the white fur of the rat explodes in a shower of blood. HUGE BLOOD SMEARED INCISORS appear, as do the red-slicked ape- like lips. The gaping bloody mouth bites again into the rat. CUT TO: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT In the background we hear Jay Leno s monologue from the Tonight Show. A small lamp and the glow from a computer screen illuminates SEBASTIAN CAINE, late twenties with the shabby good looks of a perpetual grad-student. Wiry framed and wearing only boxer shorts, Sebastian sips coffee from an  Einstein  coffee mug. He peers at a complex computer rendered molecule displayed on his screen. He pecks a few keys and the molecule shifts slightly, then falls apart. Sebastian pulls a twinkie from a hostess box, unwraps the cellophane and sucks it down. He attacks the keyboard with renewed vigor. Another molecule appears on the screen. Sebastian s fingers fly across the keyboard. The molecule blinks on and off, it trembles and twists apart. SEBASTIAN Damnit. Sebastian pears out his window. Across the courtyard, a light comes on in a neighboring window. He sees a BRUNETTE, mid-twenties, absolutely stunning, enter her living room. The Brunette thumbs through the mail, tosses it and then begins to undress. Sebastian loans over to the window, getting interested. But when the brunette reaches her bra and panties, she crosses to the window and lowers her shades. SEBASTIAN (cont d) Damnit. Sebastian leans back in his chair and closes his eyes. He s obviously tired. He opens his eyes and stares up at the ceiling. Painted across the white matte finish in big red letters is a brief reminder -  You Should Be Working.  Sebastian sighs, leans forward and begins pecking away again. LATER: The television is now only static. We pan by his alarm clock. 4 am. We find Sebastian pacing in front of his computer. He gets an idea... slides back in his chair. Types away again. The molecule reforms on the computer screen. He types a few more keys, waits, watches the molecule. Nothing happens. He hits a few more keys and watches intently for a reaction. SEBASTIAN (beat) I am a goddamn genius. He hits a few more keys and a telephone keypad appears on the screen. He dials. CUT TO: INT. ANOTHER BEDROOM - NIGHT Digital phone rings. In the bed, LINDA FOSTER, late twenties, stirs from a deep sleep. As she straggles out of bed and over to her desk, we notice a young man sleeping next to her. The ringing continues. She moves her computer mouse around and her screen comes to life. She click on a telephone icon and the ringing stops. A beat later, Sebastian appears in a window on her screen. LINDA Sebastian, do you know what time it is? SEBASTIAN (SCREEN) You know Da Vinci never slept. Said it was waste of time. LINDA What is it this time? INTERCUT: SEBASTIAN S BEDROOM Sebastian peers at the image of Linda in the computer window. He notices something behind her in the bed, the young man sleeping face down. SEBASTIAN Who s that? Linda pulls the camera off the top of the of the computer screen and positions it so Sebastian can t see the bed. LINDA Not your business. Not anymore. SEBASTIAN Touche. LINDA So you calling about anything in particular, or were you just hoping to catch me sleeping in the nude? SEBASTIAN I cracked the reversion. Upon hearing this, Linda receives a jolt of adrenaline. LINDA You cracked it? SEBASTIAN Look at this. Sebastian hits a couple of keys. A moment later the molecular structure appears on Linda s computer. SEBASTIAN Watch this. LINDA You sure? SEBASTIAN 91% sure. LINDA (astonished) Eleven months with no progress and you suddenly come up with it out of the blue? How? SEBASTIAN The usual. Coffee and twinkies. LINDA I hate you. SEBASTIAN I know. You think you could hunt down Matt and get to the lab early. I want Isabelle prepped for a live test. LINDA Yeah, I think I can find him. What are you going to do? SEBASTIAN Well y know. It s daylight in Switzerland. I gotta call the Nobel Committee and tell them to get our prizes ready. See you in a few. ON LINDA S COMPUTER SCREEN as Sebastian clicks off. Linda crosses to her bed, and shakes the guy awake. LINDA Hey... come on. DR. MATTHEW KENSINGTON, late 20s too, stirs from under sheets. MATT (groggy) What? LINDA Sebastian just called. We gotta get to the lab. Matt bolts up. MATT Shit! You didn t tell him I was here, did you? LINDA Give me some credit, will ya. MATT So what s the rush? LINDA He cracked reversion. Matt pulls his jeans on. MATT Wanna ride down? LINDA We better take our own cars. MATT You re gonna have to tell him about us eventually. LINDA I know. It s just You re his best friend. He ll feel betrayed. EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. SKYLINE - DAY From a distance, the Nation s Monuments stand awash in the harsh light of morning. CAMERA finds a BLACK PORSCHE as it pulls to the security fence of a warehouse. The imposing structure is surrounded by a chainlink fence and barbed wire. The Porsche is waved through security and heads straight into the warehouse. INT. WAREHOUSE -DAY The Porsche pulls to a halt in a reserved parking space and Sebastian exits, wearing a Hawaiian shirt, shorts, and Birkenstocks. He notes the other cars parked in the lot, then crosses to bunker in the center of the warehouse, guarded by a MARINE, shouldering an M-16. MARINE GUARD Morning, sir. SEBASTIAN Morning, Ed. MARINE GUARD Your team s in early. Something special going on? SEBASTIAN Sorry, Ed. You know the rules. Sebastian presses his thumb against a glass screen. A laser reads his print. Scan readout: CAINE, SEBASTIAN Clearance:    ALPHA ALPHA THREE Division:	CLASSIFIED The doors whisk open and Sebastian steps inside. MARINE GUARD Have a good day, sir. INT. ELEVATOR - DAY Inside the elevator is a numberless keypad. Sebastian taps in his floor code. ELEVATOR (V.0.) Authorization please. SEBASTIAN Caine zero zero two seven. ELEVATOR (V.0.) Authorization verified. Good morning, Dr. Caine. The elevator descends with a groaning hum. It passes below us and keeps descending into the belly of the earth, the shaft goes down forever. INT. HABITAT S CORRIDOR We slowly push down a hallway panelled by Plexiglas chambers. Each chamber looks as if it s tailored for a specific animal, although no animals are visible. As we pass one habitat, something slams into the Plexiglas and begins barking. Another HOWL joins in. Then SCREECHING. Suddenly the hallway fills with a dozen animal cries. THUMP. THUMP. The Plexiglas on several chambers vibrates as if angry animals were slamming against it. But still, no animals are seen. Above each chamber, VIDEO SCREENS display THERMAL IMAGES revealing heat signatures of the various animals, but they remain invisible to the naked eye. MATT taps on a sheet of Plexiglas which seals off another seemingly empty cage. MATT Isabelle ... The woodchips on the floor shift and suddenly the Plexiglas steams up right in front of Matt s face. The Plexiglas begins to shake violently. MATT (cont d) Calm down baby. Calm down. It s okay... Matt takes a pair of thermal goggles from his belt and pulls them down over his eyes. THERMAL POV - A rather large heat signature, ape-like in shape, rattles about the cage. Matt slowly unlatches the Plexiglas door and reaches inside. MATT (cont d) It s okay, baby. It s okay. I m not going to hurt you. Come here. THERMAL POV - he reaches out to the creature. He grabs hold of it, firmly. Stroking it. The creature COOS. Matt reaches for a hypo and brings it up to the creature. MATT (cont d) Just hold still. Something clamps down on his hand, breaking his skin. Blood erupts in a bite pattern. MATT (cont d) Ow, shit. Matt drops the hypo and falls back. The cage door flies open and something runs out. Matt pulls himself up to see the heat signature running down the hallway. He turns around to see another heat signature coming at him. Matt pulls off his goggles to see Linda coming up the Corridor. LINDA You okay? MATT She bit me. LINDA Yeah. She s become a lot more aggressive in the last few days. Linda takes the goggles from Matt. LINDA (cont d) Go take care of that bite. I ll get her. MATT And give you a chance to pull ahead? Never. Linda opens a lock-box at the end of the hallway and pulls out a two tranquilizer guns. She hands one to Matt. AROUND THE CORNER A slight distortion shimmers as something runs past us. We hear HOOTS and FOOTSTEPS. Looking down the shadowy corridor, we hear grunting and a haunting heavy breathing. The control door is closed though and something large and angry is throwing itself against it. We can t see anything. A few moments later, Linda and Matt round the corner, wearing goggles and leveling their pistols. MATT (ala Porky) Shh. Be vewy, vewy quiet. I m hunting simians.   heheheheh. LINDA Knock it off. (soothing voice) Isabelle! THERMAL POV - Dark hallway. Movement. A red shimmering heat signature. It comes running at Linda. HOWLING. Linda fires. A T-DART flies. Thwack... It stops in mid-air. Then falls. But it doesn t hit the floor. Instead, it stops inches above the ground. THERMAL POV - the heat signature lies in a heap at Linda s feet. MATT Good shootin , Tex. LINDA What s that make it? MATT I m still ahead. 6 to 5. Like a smug gunfighter, Linda blows imaginary smoke from the top of her tranquilizer gun. LINDA But I m catching up. INT. CORRIDOR - DAY The elevator doors open and Sebastian steps out. He s met by SARAH KENNEDY, early thirties, a fiery red-head. SARAH Can I have a word? SEBASTIAN Most normal people say good morning. SARAH Don t you think you should test the protocol on the liver samples before you inject Isabelle? SEBASTIAN How many tissue samples have we successfully regressed? Hundreds, right? How many have gone on to work on the full system? None. SARAH That s beside the point. SEBASTIAN No, that is the point. I m not going to waste six months of my life on an outmoded testing procedure. This thing works. I know it. I feel it. Linda comes down the corridor, listening in on the tail end of the conversation. SARAH Fine. You can mop up afterward. SEBASTIAN You think I m going to kill Isabelle? SARAH Kill? More like liquefy. SEBASTIAN Sarah, thank you for your opinion, but I m the project leader. Understand? She says ... SARAH Yes, Sir. ... but somehow it feels like  Fuck you.  She storms off. Sebastian turns to Linda. SEBASTIAN How did you ever convince me to hire her? LINDA You said you wanted the beat vet in the country. SEBASTIAN Yeah, well she cares more about the animals than the research. LINDA Maybe that s why she s so good. CUT TO: CLOSE ON: MATT as he shuts off the spinning cyclotron. As it s spinning slows to a halt, he pops the top and reaches in, removing... A GLOWING VIAL OF ORANGE LIQUID. Sebastian peers at the vial. SEBASTIAN Who da Man? You da Man. MATT As we pull out we see we are. INT. LABORATORY - DAY Almost feels like a dungeon. Think high-tech Frankenstein. Walls lined with video displays, technical readouts, bizarre medical equipment. On a table in the middle of the room, a sheet drapes over a humanoid form, strapped down at it s invisible limbs. The straps move slightly... ghostly. Wires lead from the body to lots of machinery. MATT Protocol is hot. SEBASTIAN Vitals? Sarah, checks over the various readouts ... heartbeat, blood pressure, the rest. SARAH Normal. CARTER ABBEY, the late thirties lab assistant, wheels in a cart of equipment. Linda taken a seat by the table and pushes aside the sheet. BOOMING VOICE THIS IS GOD. YOU ARE DISTURBING THE NATURAL ORDER OF THINGS AND WILL BE SEVERELY PUNISHED FOR ALL ETERNITY. GOD HAS SPOKEN. SEBASTIAN How many times do I have to tell you, Frank you aren t God. (beat) I am. FRANK (LOUDSPEAKER) Sorry, Boss. Forgot. Sebastian glance up at a glass booth overlooking the Laboratory floor. TWO PEOPLE in the booth. SEBASTIAN You guys ready to roll? INT. OBSERVATION BOOTH FRANK CHASE, early thirties, and tech expert JANICE WALTON, early twenties, man a small booth above the lab. They re dressed more like band roadies than scientists. The room is crammed with electronic and recording equipment. A handful of monitors display different images of the lab. Thermal and regular video. Another screen monitors vital signs. FRANK We are live and in color. On your mark. Frank and Janice looks down on their colleagues. Sebastian nods their way. SEBASTIAN Okay. Roll  em. JANICE Okay. We are rolling record on videos one through twelve. Frank hits a series of buttons and speaks into a microphone. Recording. INT. LABORATORY - DAY Frank s voice echoes through the chamber. FRANK (V.O.) Subject Isabelle Two. Currently in phase shift... one hundred twenty six days, eighteen hours. LINDA Testing De-Phase protocol. Injecting serial protein Caine One Two Five. Linda removes a glowing vial of orange liquid from a centrifuge nearby. MATT Maybe if you stopped naming them after yourself, you d have better luck. SEBASTIAN Why thank you, Dr. Kensington, for that keen scientific observation. I ll be sure to include it in my memoirs. MATT A whole mention? And I thought I was just gonna be a footnote. Matt unwraps a hypodermic needle and jabs the needle into the vial, drawing up the colored liquid. INT. OBSERVATION BOOTH MATT Okay. Frank and Janice monitor Isabelle s vitals. INT. LABORATORY - DAY Tension in the air. SEBASTIAN (to Linda) Ready. She wraps a bungee cord around nothing and pulls it tight. She then takes some dye and sprays it. A surface appears, floating beneath the restraints. It sheens in the light as Linda searches for a vein. She slaps the surface several times. A small bulge appears, like a vein. LINDA Propped. MATT Let s make some history. Matt lowers the hypo to the vein. But Sebastian takes the hypo from Matt s hand. SEBASTIAN Nice try, Sparky. Matt relinquishes the needle. LINDA Come on, Isabelle. You can do this. Sebastian lowers the hypo. The skin bonds and gives. The needle remains in sight after it slips through the visible surface. Matt presses down on the hypo plunger, releasing a dye into his bloodstream. The gold liquid twists into a long snaking tube up and down the limb. It s the shape of a vein. The liquid begins to react. Small flashes of light blip up and down the strand of color. Ba-bump.. ba-bump... the heartbeat starts to speed up. SARAH Elevated heartbeat. INT. OBSERVATION BOOTH Janice analyzes the screens. JANICE We re still in the green. FRANK Confirmed. Vitals still in the normal range. INT. LABORATORY The glowing liquid turns from gold to red as the complex webbing of a bloodstream appears. MATT It s reacting. Spreading out from the bloodstream, soon becomes visible.. the shadow of a skeletal system. SEBASTIAN Do you see this? LINDA It s working. It s actually working. Matt pulls the sheet back. Muscles are beginning to appear. And eyeballs. Frightened eyeballs. SARAH Heart rate s up. She s scared. Sarah soothes her. SARAH (cont d) It's okay, baby. It's okay. SEBASTIAN Subject began manifesting almost Immediately. Protocol is reacting quickly. Isabelle starts to struggle against her restraints. She begins to howl. LINDA Subject may be in pain or extreme discomfort. SARAH Goddamnit. Blood pressure elevating. Brain activity going through the roof. The brain appears, seemingly growing from the inside out. The shape of a large half-formed monkey grows from the inside out. A SKULL APPEARS howling in pain, in horror. SARAH (cont d) We ve got a problem. SEBASTIAN What? What problem! Sarah checks her monitors. SARAH It s her heart. We can see the heart beating in the ape s FRANK (V.0.) I got an erratic heart beat. SARAH She s going into cardiac arrest. LINDA Got the crash cart. Carter charges the crash cart and rolls it in. SARAH We re losing her. Her machine flatlines. SEBASTIAN No! It s got to work. The body is only half there. It looks as if its caught in decomposition. Linda rubs the cardiac paddles together. LINDA Clear! Linda slams the paddles on the monkey s chest. The jolt of electricity makes the monkey visible again for a brief moment. Then the skin and flesh fade away again. SARAH We ve got something! The heartbeat starts up again. The body continues its march toward,visibility. SARAH (cont d) Still. erratic. LINDA Come on Isabelle. Come on. You can do it. You can fucking do it. Everybody s pulling for her. SARAH Come on, monkey. MATT Do it. Do it. Come on. Muscles spread like a rash on bone as the monkey twists and turns, frightened. Then skin. The monkey howls. Skin forms over the muscles reappearing like it was being painted on before our eyes. SARAH Stabilizing. The entire form glows, then blinks, then glows again, as if it was discharging some stored energy. FRANK (V.0.) Brain activity returning to normal. The monkey grunts and groans. Blinks its eyes. Linda hovers over it stroking its fur. LINDA Welcome back, Isabelle. Sebastian puts his hand on Linda s shoulder... a move that does not go unnoticed by Matt. We did it. SEBASTIAN (beat) How is she? SARAH (surprised) I think she s gonna be okay DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. HABITAT 
Frank, Matt, Sarah, Janice and Linda watch Isabelle rise and walk about the cage. She goes over to the other monkeys and joins in their grooming rituals. 
CARTER Amazing. She's normal, absolutely healthy. If you didn't know any better, you'd think nothing had happened to her. 
MATT (ribbing Sarah) Yeah. I can't wait to slice up her brain and trace her neural pathways. 
SARAH Screw you, Matt. 
MATT Well maybe not right away. 
LINDA We should celebrate. 
INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
The fanciest one in D.C. 
The entire eight person team sits around a round table, drunk and laughing, as the last champagne flute is filled. 
Sebastian raises his glass. 
SEBASTIAN To the finest research team I've ever known. 
A round of "Hear, hears" and they all clink glasses and drink. 
EXT. RESTAURANT BALCONY - LATER 
The din of the diners fades away as Linda slips out onto the restaurant's balcony. She find Sebastian leaning against a railing, breathing in the night air. 
SEBASTIAN Hey... 
LINDA I thought you'd gone. 
SEBASTIAN Where would I go? 
He looks out over the sweep of the city, the twinkling lights of D.C. and darkness of the Potomac river. 
SEBASTIAN (cont'd) Twenty years ago there were no computers, no fax machines, no cell phones. I was just wondering what the world will be like twenty years from now... if what we're doing will change everything. 
LINDA A little "I am become death... the shatterer of worlds"? 
SEBASTIAN Something like that. 
LINDA Since the day I met, all you wanted to do was change the world. 
She puts her hand on his shoulder. 
LINDA (cont'd) Listen, I know we've... I mean... well ... I just want you to know how proud I am of you. I know it probably doesn't mean a lot... 
SEBASTIAN Actually it does. (beat) I guess since you were there from the beginning, you know me better than anyone else on this godforsaken planet. 
LINDA You're positively maudlin. You should be happy. Do you have any idea what you've accomplished? 
SEBASTIAN Yeah... but I was working so hard, I didn't realize I'd have no one to share it with. 
Sebastian heads back inside. But he stops and turns back. 
SEBASTIAN (cont'd) I don't suppose we could turn back the clock for a night and you could come home with me? 
Her look says it all. Too much water under the bridge. 
SEBASTIAN (cont'd) Right. Sorry. Too much champagne. 
He turns and heads back into the party. As he heads in he passes Matt heading out. He and Sebastian exchange "Heys". 
MATT What was that about? 
LINDA Nothing. It's just... He is who he is. Sometimes I just have to be reminded. 
CUT TO: 
INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT 
Sebastian wanders through the empty hallways of the laboratory. 
INT. HALLWAY OF HABITATS - NIGHT 
Sebastian paces back and forth, examining the habitats. He taps on the Plexiglas of one. The cubicle explodes with 
SEBASTIAN ... on myself. 
The team sits around the conference table. Their jaws drop and they stare at him with wide eyes. 
FRANK Are you nuts? 
SEBASTIAN Was Jonas Salk nuts? 
FRANK Yeah. Pretty sure he was. 
CARTER And remember, for every Jonas Salk, there are a bunch of guys who aren't famous cuz they died. 
SEBASTIAN If we're that unsure, how can we morally justify testing it on someone else? 
JANICE Isn't it a little soon to be moving into phase three anyway? 
SARAH She's right. We haven't even finished collating the phase two research. 
SEBASTIAN We'll have plenty of time to collate and cross-reference later. Monkey data doesn't matter anyway. The only real data is human data. 
SARAH You don't even know if any of the protocols will work on humans. 
SEBASTIAN How are we gonna find out? Besides, we've succeeded with a gorilla and their DNA is 98% the same as humans. And the 2% is not that significant. 
LINDA Sebastian ... humans can talk, build houses and cook in microwave ovens. Gorilla's live in trees. That's a helluva 2% if you ask me. 
SEBASTIAN We're all concerned. I know that. But if we're gonna move forward ever, this is something we have to do. 
LINDA Why you? Why not one of us? 
SEBASTIAN The risks. I couldn't ask... 
MATT (interrupting) What if we volunteer? 
LINDA What if you're too valuable to lose? 
SEBASTIAN I'm Project Leader. It's my formula and my call. The best way to express your concern is to make damn sure you do your best work. I'll want about four weeks to... 
FRANK To put your affairs in order? 
SEBASTIAN To run some more reversions and tissue tests and then we'll attempt the phase shift. I'll stay shifted for three days of testing and then we'll perform a quantum regression. 
INT. SEBASTIAN'S OFFICE 
A knock on the door. 
SEBASTIAN Come in. 
Linda pushes into the room and closes the door behind her. 
SEBASTIAN (cont'd) What? 
LINDA In the past six years, I've never once challenged your decisions, but this ... Sebastian. I don't think you should do this. 
SEBASTIAN You don't understand. 
LINDA Oh please. How long were we together? You must've said it a million times ... Nobody knows who built the lunar lander. All they remember in the first man on the moon. 
Sebastian shrugs and nods. 
LINDA (cont'd) But what if something happens to you... what about the project? 
Sebastian smiles. 
SEBASTIAN Lin, trust me... nothing's going to happen. 
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Linda and Matt are in bed together. Matt kisses her way up and down her arm. But Linda is distracted. 
LINDA He refuses to listen to reason. 
MATT Can we talk about this later? I'm trying to make love to you. 
LINDA Sorry. I just can't let it go. 
Matt props himself up on the pillow. 
MATT I know how you're feeling. Hell, he and I've been friends since freshman year. 
LINDA So how can we let him do this? 
MATT What if you were given the opportunity to be the first person on ,Mars, would you go? 
LINDA In a heartbeat. 
Linda nods. Back to business. 
LINDA Start recording. 
INT. OBSERVATION BOOTH. 
Janice hits record on the equipment decks. 
JANICE We're hot. All systems nominal, Houston. 
Frank coordinates all the data being fed into the computers. He pushes a series of buttons and speaks into a microphone. 
FRANK Okay, kids. Let's make some history. 
INT. LABORATORY - DAY 
Frank's voice echoes through the chamber. 
LINDA Subject: Male, Age 29, weight 166 lbs. 
Matt jabs a hypodermic into small vial of colored liquid. Draws up 20ccs. 
MATT (to Linda) Ready. 
Linda takes the hypo from Matt. 
MATT (cont'd) If the tests are any indication it should work quickly. 
SEBASTIAN I'll inject myself. If anything goes wrong, they can't blame you. 
She hands the hypo Sebastian and steps away. Sebastian stares at the golden formula silently for a moment. 
LINDA We can still shut down, Sebastian. 
He shakes his head. 
MATT Any last words? 
SEBASTIAN Yeah. If I'm killed, pretend I said something deep and clever. 
Then... Back to business. He inserts the needle into the I.V. Sebastian. Presses into himself and depresses the plunger. 
LINDA Injection was administered at (checks watch) 
The colored liquid snakes it's way into his bloodstream. 
LINDA (cont'd) Keep talking. Tell us what you're feeling. 
SEBASTIAN Nothing so far. 
SARAH Vitals are stable. 
They wait and watch. 
LINDA Nothing's happening. 
Another moment passes by. 
MATT Human DNA structure is slightly more complex... it's possible that it may take more time... 
Another moment passes. 
LINDA Maybe we overlooked something. 
SEBASTIAN Recheck the protocol. It can't be non- reactive. 
CARTER Kinda like a firecracker with a bad fuse... 
Sebastian shoots Carter a questioning look. 
CARTER (cont'd) Don't know if it'll go off. 
LINDA Frank? 
FRANK (V.0.) (from the booth) No change in bio-electric. 
SEBASTIAN Goddammit. 
Another long pause. Sebastian concentrates. 
SEBASTIAN (cont'd) Okay wait, my arm... it's getting a bit warm... yeah, it's ... it's starting to tingle... 
Excitement overtakes the room. 
SEBASTIAN (cont'd) Okay... it's spreading to my back... like, like a fever... 
CARTER Let's get him into recovery. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER 
The chamber is half constructed out of Plexiglas at the end of the Hallway of Habitats. 
On the recovery bed, a sheet drapes over Sebastian's invisible body. The gentle bleatings of medical machinery pound out a dulling rhythm. 
Linda sleeps in a corner chair as Matt slips into the room. He checks the readouts on Sebastian then takes a seat by Linda. She wakes with a start. 
MATT S'okay. You nodded off. 
LINDA His breathing's hypnotic. How long's it been? 
MATT Seventeen hours. 
LINDA Where are the others? 
MATT In the lab crunching numbers. We've got enough data there for two lifetimes of research. 
Linda rubs her temples and gestures to the bed. 
LINDA I keep looking at that hole, wondering if he's really there. 
She notices something out of the corner of his eye. The sheet twitches. 
LINDA (cont'd) Did you see... 
The sheet twitches again. 
MATT He may be coming out of it. 
Linda and Matt watch intently. Then suddenly... the sheets thrash violently. A yell of pain. 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE The lights! Turn off the goddamn lights! Ah Christ! 
Linda jumps up and crosses to Sebastian. Matt rushes to the wall and turns off the lights. Darkness. The room is lit by the glow of machinery. 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd) I can't... I can't close my eyes. I can't close my eyes. 
LINDA Your eyelids are transparent. 
The sheets slowly stop thrashing. 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE So I ... I'm... 
LINDA Yes. 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE My arms. I can.. where? ... I can feel them... 
LINDA Your arms ... your whole body... It worked, Sebastian. It worked. 
The sheet rises and slips away. The wires, seemingly connected to thin air, spread out like a spider's web and then fall away one-by-one. The monitors all go dead. 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE Mirror. I ... I want to see. 
MATT Over here in the corner. 
Matt motions to a dark corner of the room, toward a mirror and sink. We push in on the mirror. No reflection. Suddenly it fogs up ... Sebastian's breath. A finger tracing appears in the fog ... but of course we see no finger. The sink faucet twists on and water runs. It cups into the shape of hands and lifts into the air, splashing against the surface of Sebastian's face. Beads of water cling to his f ace, outlining it I shape f or a moment before dripping away. 
MATT (cont'd) What was it like? 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE I ... It's hard to think. 
Sebastian's voice is now behind him. Matt turns around. 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd) The transformation... I remember every molecule in my body shattering. 
MATT It was painful? 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE At first... but then everything went black. I couldn't see or hear or feel anything. It was all just black... like I wasn't connected. 
LINDA Your system received quite a shock. 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE At least my senses are starting to return... You're wearing your Shalimar, aren't you? 
Linda realizes that he's standing very close by. Her hair lifts slightly and Sebastian inhales. Chills go down her spine. 
LINDA Sebastian. 
Linda's hair drops back to her shoulders. 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE This is weird. I'm looking through myself at the floor. I'm looking right through myself. I can't tell ... 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd) Index that. That was when it started burn. Epidermal reaction. 
JANICE Index Mark. 112125. 
Janice scribble the numbers in her notebook. Linda crosses, nursing a cup of coffee. 
LINDA It's late. Time you got some rest. 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE Just a little longer. 
LINDA Hate to pull rank, but you're my patient now and you need rest. We've got a busy day tomorrow. 
Heavy sigh. 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE Fine. 
INT. THE RECOVERY ROOM - NIGHT 
As Linda enters she points to a small camera in the upper corner of the room. 
LINDA We've set up a thermal camera for observation and I've arranged one of us to be here 24/7 in case you need anything. The team's gonna be on alpha- call alert for the duration. If anything goes wrong, we can all be here within... 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE Thirty minutes. Yes,,_I know. I wrote the procedure. 
LINDA I was trying to be reassuring. 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE You like this don't you? 
LINDA What's that? 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE Being in charge. 
It's clear she does. But she's certainly not going to admit it. 
LINDA Please. I'm just doing my job. 
CUT TO: 
CLOSE ON: A video screen. A thermal lump lays stretched out on the bed. 
Pull back to reveal SARAH staring at the screen. We are. 
INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT 
A bank of monitors display the various angles of the Hall of Habitats, the laboratory and, of course, Sebastian in the recovery room. 
Linda hands Sarah a cup of coffee. 
LINDA You gonna be okay? 
SARAH Fine. It's not like I have anything else going on in my sad pathetic life. 
LINDA Carter'll be in at six to spell you and I'll be in by nine. Call me if anything happens, okay? 
Through the glass wall, Linda sees Matt knocking and waving her out. 
SARAH I'm fine. Go on ahead. 
INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT 
The rest of the team straggles into the elevator. Yawning. Exhausted from the day. 
CARTER Man, I'm tired. That was a long day. 
LINDA Days only get longer from here. 
Linda catches Matt's eye. Gives him a look. "You coming over?" Matt nods, "yes", imperceptible to everyone but Linda. She smiles. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT 
Deserted and dark. 
INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT 
Late. Sarah rubs her temples. Her eyelids are heavy. She's having real trouble staying awake. The buzzing fluorescent light isn't helping either. 
INT. RECOVERY ROOM - NIGHT 
The sheets ruffle and the indentation disappears from the bed. We can hear breathing and soft sound of bare feet shuffling against linoleum. 
CAMERA SLOWLY PANS toward the door, as if we, are following someone walking. 
The door handle turns and the door pushes open. 
LINDA I can talk to him. 
SARAH No. I mean... (she torn, unsure of herself) It was probably nothing. I shouldn't've mentioned it. 
MATT You sure? 
SARAH Yeah, I'm sure. I mean, y'know, why would he do that, right? Just, this place at night can be kinda creepy, y'know. 
INT. RESEARCH LAB - DAY 
Sebastian, wearing surgical scrubs sits in an examination chair. Wire leads sprout from the electrodes covering his head and arms. The electrodes seem to outline his body. 
MATT So, how was your first night? 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE Restless. Hard to sleep when you can't close your eyes. 
As Sebastian talks, we can see the electrodes around his jaw pump up and down. 
MATT Yeah? What'd you do? 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE Got up a couple of times. Knocked about. 
MATT Yeah, Sarah mentioned you weren't in your cubicle. She said she called you over the intercom and you didn't respond. 
SEBASTIAN I guess I didn't hear. I had the radio on. 
MATT It'd be helpful to us if you'd tell whoever's on duty where you're going to. I mean, if something were to happen, we'd want to know where to find you. 
SEBASTIAN I didn't think it was a problem. 
MATT It isn't. I just don't want it to become one. 
Machines pump out EEG, EKG readouts. Matt studies them. 
MATT (cont'd) Readings are normal. 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE Next I want to run a VV and UVF analysis of the platelets. 
MATT We'll have to draw some more blood. 
CUT TO: 
Sarah rolls up Sebastian's sleeve, revealing empty air. She wraps a bungee cord around the nothing, pulls it tight and sprays the inside of his elbow with dye. She acts very self conscious. 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE You okay? 
SARAH Yeah. Why? 
SEBASTIAN You just seem a little nervous. 
SARAH No. I...I'm fine. Hold still. This might hurt a bit. 
The surface of his skin sheens in the light as Linda searches for a vein. She slaps his arm several times, then plunges a hypodermic needle into his skin. His skin bends and gives. The needle remains in sight after it slips through the visible surface. Sarah presses down on the hypo plunger, releasing a dye into his bloodstream. 
SARAH (cont'd) Dr. Caine... this might sounds stupid, but are you... are you looking at me. 
The red dye twists into a long snaking red tube up and down his arm. His vein. 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE No. I was looking at the clock. Why? 
Sarah draws the plunger back, sucking Sebastian's blood into the hypodermic and then yanks the needle out. 
SARAH Just felt like someone was staring at me. 
Sarah pulls the vial off the needle and labels it with a grease pencil. After a few beats the red dye in Sebastian's blood stream dissolves and disappears, as does the liquid in the vial. 
TESTING MONTAGE 
INT. MRI ROOM 
MATT slides Sebastian's sheet covered frame into an MRI. Even though his head is not visible, it shown up on the MRI scanner. 
INT. MAIN LABORATORY 
CARTER and SARAH lower a harness into a water tank. SEBASTIAN'S BODY displaces the water, revealing an empty body shaped cavity in the water. 
INT. OBSERVATION ROOM 
CARTER sips a BIG GULP and stares at a monitor which shows two eat signatures in the Recovery Chamber, huddled over a chess game. 
INT. RECOVER CHAMBER 
on a chessboard... A BLACK KNIGHT takes WHITE BISHOP, seemingly all by itself. 
Across the table, Matt leans back and topples his WHITE KING acknowledging defeat. 
SEBASTIAN I can't br... br... 
Sebastian begins wheezing. 
LINDA What's wrong? 
SARAH He's not breathing. 
Muscles are beginning to appear. And eyeballs. Frightened eyeballs. 
MATT Subject manifesting. 
SARAH Pulse erratic. 
Sebastian pulls against his bonds. One set tears off. 
LINDA Carter! 
Carter grabs onto the mass of flesh and muscle, trying to hold it back. But the restraints snap. The half-visible man is screaming. He grabs Carter and throws him across the room. 
LINDA (cont'd) Sebastian! Sebastian! 
And just for a second, Sebastian is fully visible. And free. He looks around like a scared animal and rips off all the wiring. 
LINDA (cont'd) Sebastian! 
MATT Get a tranq. Stat. 
Sarah preps a tranquilizer. Sebastian locks eyes with Linda. He's lost, he doesn't know where he is. And suddenly, he crumbles to the ground. Linda rushes over to him and puts bar hand on his shoulder. Light bleeds from his skin and his skin begins to dissolve from sight. 
LINDA He's reverting. Got him on the table. 
Matt, Linda and Sarah pull the shifting body up and onto an operating table. Carter pulls himself up and heads back to the group. 
LINDA (cont'd) Get me a I.V. of A.G. seven. 
SARAH I got no pulse. No pulse. 
MATT Start CPR. 
Carter locates Sebastian's heart, not a difficult thing because we can actually see it. Carter's hand pushes down in the air inches above the heart. We see the heart being pushed and squeezed. Sarah slaps an air bag on Sebastian and starts pumping air into his lungs. Sebastian's heart begins to beat again, beat on its own. 
CARTER Getting a pulse. 
MATT Holy shit. What happened? 
LINDA Sebastian... can you hear me? Can you hear me? How are his pupils? 
MATT I can't see his goddamn pupils! 
SARAH I think he's going into shock. 
We slowly FADE OUT to the sights and sounds of our scientist- doctors working on Sebastian... And the beeping of Sebastian's erratic heartbeat. 
FADE UP ON: 
A HABITAT 
The heartbeat continues. In the shadows, two Rhesus Monkeys defend themselves against an unseen attacker. Blood splatters against the Plexiglas wall. 
We FADE OUT AGAIN... 
INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT 
Linda stares through the Plexiglas walls into the Recovery Chamber. Inside the Chamber, Sarah and Carter- eye the various screens monitoring Sebastian's vitals. 
Linda watches the hollow pocket underneath the blanket. She watches the rhythm of its rises and falls as Sebastian sleeps. Matt comes up behind her. 
MATT Just got the tissue sample results. Cellular cohesion is stable. 
Linda exhales in relief. Matt puts his hands on her shoulder. Pulls her close to him. 
MATT (cont'd) How bout you? You gonna be okay? 
LINDA Guess so. (beat) I was just thinking about the Apollo missions. Y'know? Grissom, White and Chaffee... What it was like for them on that launch pad that day, thinking they were gonna reach the stars only to burn to death. 
MATT Sometimes the test pilots make history. Sometimes the planes crash and people die. 
LINDA But he didn't die, did he? (beat) What if we can't bring him back? What then? 
MATT It's just a little hitch is all. He'll be the first to tell that he'll crack it and I'm sure he will. It'll just take time. (beat) Listen, let's got out of here. We could drive up to the old observatory. We'll take some wine and go count the stars and forget all this for awhile. 
She pulls away. 
LINDA No. I want to be here for him. 
Sebastian is hit by the spectral radiation beams. 
Matt pulls a vial of orange liquid from the cyclotron. 
INT. CORRIDOR - DAY 
Sebastian, still in his latex and scrubs, but looking like he's been dragged through the nine levels of purgatory, is escorted back to the recovery chamber by Linda and Matt. 
He crosses to his bed and collapses on it. Closes his eyes. 
SEBASTIAN The testing's making me sick. 
LINDA Could be the barium or the radiation. 
MATT You're physiology has changed and, well, all bets are off. 
SEBASTIAN I can't believe I have to spend another night here. (to Linda) Suppose you're gonna go home now, meet up with that boyfriend of yours now. 
Linda and Matt exchange a glance. Linda quickly covers. 
LINDA Do you want me to stay? 
SEBASTIAN No. That's okay. It's just, being a guinea pig is more work than I thought. I'll be fine. 
INT. RESEARCH COMPOUND - NIGHT 
Various shots of the empty hallways and deserted labs. 
INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT 
Carter kicks back in his chair listening to his walkman stereo and playing gameboy. 
INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - DAY 
Sebastian, in scrubs and make-up, paces back and forth. 
He slams the wall in frustration. He crosses to a mirror and examines himself. He doesn't look half bad. He pokes his cheeks. There's something about him that's a little off, but only if you look close. 
INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT 
A shadow falls across Carter's face. He looks up. It's Sebastian wearing street clothes - jeans and a hooded sweatshirt over his latex mask. 
Carter pulls of his earphones. 
CARTER (surprised) Dr. Caine. What's up? 
SEBASTIAN Just stopped by to let you know, I'm going out for a bit. 
Sebastian turns back into the hallway. 
CARTER Going out? Hey wait a sec! 
Carter scrambles to his feet. 
INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT 
Carter catches up with Sebastian. 
CARTER What do you mean going out for a bit? 
SEBASTIAN If I don't get out of here, I'm gonna go crazy. 
CARTER But you're not supposed to leave the compound. 
SEBASTIAN Why not? 
CARTER That's the rule. 
SEBASTIAN Yes, but I made that rule. It's my rule and I'm changing it. 
CARTER You can't just change it. 
Sebastian hits the elevator button. The doors open. 
SEBASTIAN Carter, I was suppose to be like this for three days. Three fucking days and I'll be damned if I'm going to spend the rest of my life as a prisoner in this godforsaken dump. Now I'm going out. I'll be back in a couple of hours. Okay? 
The elevator doors close with Sebastian inside. Shit. 
CARTER Shit. 
Carter runs down the corridor. 
INT OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT 
Carter picks up the phone and dials. 
INT. HALLWAY, SEBASTIAN BUILDING - NIGHT 
Linda exits the elevator and heads down to Sebastian's door. She knocks. Waits. No answer. She knocks again. Waits. 
And then she tries the door. It's unlocked. She pushes the door open. 
LINDA Sebastian? 
INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Linda pushes through the living room, into the bedroom. 
LINDA Sebastian? 
She notices that the bathroom light is on. 
BATHROOM 
On the floor she finds Sebastian's clothing and on the vanity she sees his latex face and hands. 
LINDA Oh shit. 
She scramble for the bedroom phone and quickly dials. 
LINDA (cont'd) Yeah, Matt, it's me. He was here. No. He's taken his make-up off. I don't know...He must be outside somewhere. I don't know where he went. I'm coming back to the lab. How? How'm I supposed to do that? I CAN'T FUCKING SEE HIM! We're going on alpha call.  I want everyone at the lab now. We're gonna need thermal visors and we may need tranqs. 
As she hangs up the phone, and heads out. The CAMERA doesn't follow, but instead pushes through the blinds and out the window. As we cross the courtyard, we begin to hear muffled cries of terror. We hold on the Brunette's window as we... 
CUT TO: 
INT. BRUNETTE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
The bedroom door opens and we see the Brunette, nude and curled up on the bed, sobbing. We follow the sounds of heavy breathing to the front door of her apartment. The door opens and we push out into the hallway. We can see indentations of feet appear on the hallway carpet. 
INT. CORRIDOR BY SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT 
The elevator doors open and Linda steps inside. The doors close shut behind her. A beat later we see the indentations of footsteps come around the corner. We follow the breathing and stumbling footfalls back into... 
INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
We push over to the bathroom sink. The faucet turns on and the water starts running. 
We see the water cup under the faucet and splash against Sebastian's face. His face appears briefly in the water. Then the water slips away. 
For second it sounds like he's crying, but then we hear something far worse. He's laughing. Nervous laughter. 
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT 
Matt hands out thermal goggles, while Frank loads and passes out tranquilizer guns. 
JANICE What are the tranqs for? 
LINDA Use your imagination. 
JANICE Are you saying he's dangerous? 
MATT We're just saying we need to be cautious. 
LINDA The Metro stops running after midnight and he's on foot, so he can't have gotten too far. 
CARTER Look, this isn't a monkey we're talking about. It's Dr. Caine. Don't you think you're over reacting? 
LINDA This program is classified. If he's out there it means someone might find out about him. He could destroy the whole program. 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE Relax, Linda. No one's gonna find out. 
They all turn around. At the door is Sebastian, back in his latex outfit. 
MATT Where the hell have you been? 
SEBASTIAN I got a little stir crazy, so I went to my apartment to pick up some stuff. 
LINDA Bullshit! I went to your apartment and I happen to know you did a helluva lot more than pick some stuff up. 
SEBASTIAN What are you talking about? 
LINDA You, of all people How could you? 
Caught dead to rights, Sebastian sinks into his chair. He thinks she knows. 
LINDA (cont'd) You put yourself and this project at risk. 
SEBASTIAN Just what did you see in my apartment? 
LINDA I saw your face and your clothes. 
LINDA I don't want to fight you. I just want what's best for the program. 
SEBASTIAN I know. And you being right doesn't make it any easier for me. 
LINDA You can be scared. That's okay. 
SEBASTIAN I'm not scared of being stuck this way. With a little more make-up and practice, I could... (he motions to his face) ... pass. Y'know, get by in the world. But the testing... 
LINDA You're talking like you've given up. It's only been a few months. 
SEBASTIAN What if it's years? I don't know how much more testing I can take. 
INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - LATER 
Sebastian paces back and forth, glancing at the camera. 
INT. LABORATORY - DAY 
Linda, Matt and Sebastian, in latex and scrubs, stare at an electron microscope's video display. On the screen in a sparse colony of blood calls but every second more and more cells appear, filling the gap. 
MATT 60% reversion. 70% ... 75% ... 80% ... 
The others in the lab listen. They start to get excited. Janice and Carter leave their research and come over to watch the screen. 
SEBASTIAN We've got it. We've got it. 
MATT 
They wait. Linda points to a blank patch on the screen. 
LINDA That's all we need. 
SEBASTIAN Come on, baby. Come on. 
But the blood cells nearest the blank patch twinkle out existence, and then those around them also blink away until after a beat, the screen is empty. 
MATT Full quantum cascade at 95%. (beat) I'm sorry. 
SEBASTIAN You're sorry? You're fucking sorry? 
Sebastian picks up a glass beaker and hurls it against the wall. It shatters. 
SEBASTIAN (cont'd) Six weeks of this shit and you're sorry! 
He grabs more equipment and begins tossing it in a rage. Carter and Janice grab him and restrain him. After struggling against them a beat or two, Sebastian calms down and pushes away from them and heads out the door. 
JANICE I don't blame him. 
LINDA I'll go talk to him. 
MATT Leave him alone. He just needs to blow off some steam. 
INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - NIGHT 
CUT TO: 
Sebastian lies in his bed, staring at the security camera. The camera stares back at him. 
As if from a dream, we hear the Brunette's muffled scream and cries for help. As we push in on Sebastian's cold eyes, we can barely make out her face thrashing back in forth in panic and confusion. 
Sebastian suddenly rises. 
He crosses to the video camera and examines a small panel on the underneath of the camera. 
He reaches into a box of twinkies and pulls out one of the sponge cakes and begins munching. He hits the intercom button on the phone. 
FRANK (V.0.) Yeah? 
SEBASTIAN I'm going to the lab. 
FRANK (V.0.) Don't you sleep? 
SEBASTIAN Waste of time. Da Vinci never slept. 
INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT 
Frank eyes Sebastian in the monitor. 
FRANK Okay. I'm here if you need me. 
He watches as Sebastian's heat signature moves toward the door. 
INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT 
In the dark deserted lab, Sebastian pulls together a circuit board, a computer chip and some wiring. He seems be assembling something. 
Linda pulls bags of frozen plasma from the shelves in the walk-in storage freezer. 
LINDA I'm telling you, I know him. Something's going on. 
MATT Think he knows about us. 
LINDA If he knew about us, he'd be angry and that wasn't angry. 
INT. CORRIDOR - DAY 
Janice heads up one of the corridors when something on the floor catches her eye. She bends down and takes a look at it. Barely visible on the floor is a fragment of a BAREFOOT FOOTPRINT. 
She runs her finger along the dried mud. It turns to dust. 
INT. LABORATORY - DAY 
Sebastian holds his latex head on his lap, while EEG leads hang suspended in mid-air, outlining his real head. Carter analyzes the results. 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE When you were a kid, you ever dream about being invisible? 
CARTER Sure... all the time. 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE What did you imagine you'd do? 
CARTER The usual. 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE What's the usual? 
CARTER Hanging out in the girl's locker room. Kicking Jimmy Margiani's ass. 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE Jimmy Margiani? 
CARTER School asshole. Drove a red Trans Am. Back then, I was the size of a small planet and made a rather large target. 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE Ever think up anything along the grand scale? 
CARTER Sure. World domination. Manipulating stock markets, consolidating a political power base. But those are more recent fantasies. 
Carter pulls off the electrodes and Sebastian slides on his latex facemask. 
SEBASTIAN And what if it weren't fantasy? What if you were out there in the world and could do whatever you wanted with no consequences whatsoever. How far would go? I mean... if it were real? 
CARTER I don't know, man. Out in the real world... I mean, there's a responsibility... 
SEBASTIAN Let's say you saw a woman with amazing tits. Would you brush against them? 
CARTER Hell, I try and do that now. 
SEBASTIAN Human nature. So if you could get away with more, would you do more? 
CARTER I read that in a survey at a major university they asked college students "Would you steal if you were guaranteed to get away with it?" 82% said yes. 
SEBASTIAN Eighty two percent? Makes you wonder if the world's ready for what we're doing. 
CARTER So, Doc what did you do? 
SEBASTIAN What do you mean? 
CARTER When you were out. 
SEBASTIAN I just walked around. Y'know. 
CARTER Aw, you just walked around? Come on. There's more, right? 
SEBASTIAN Like what? 
CARTER Man, I'd be walking up to people saying shit like "This is God, go,get a haircut." Or hanging out in the changing room at Victoria's Secret. 
SEBASTIAN Kind of sophomoric, don't you think. Besides, it was late and I wasn't out that long. 
CARTER Well, did you see anybody? 
SEBASTIAN There was this one girl. 
CARTER Yeah? And did you mess with her? 
SEBASTIAN Naw... 
Sebastian gives Carter a sly grin. 
SEBASTIAN (cont'd) Well maybe a little. (beat) I tell you though, a man could get used to it. 
INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT 
Alone, Linda packs up her stuff for the evening. 
... until we are face-to-face with the unhappy barking dog. 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE Shhhh. It's Nobody-It's nothing. 
The Plexiglas door to the doggie's cage swings open and some invisible force grabs little doggie around the neck. The force squeezes its little fur ball throat until the barking stops. 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd) Nobody's gonna hurt you. 
The force keeps squeezing until the little doggie goes limp. Then the dog smashes against the Plexiglas over and over until blood spills out its mouth. The Plexiglas door swings closed again and moments later the door to Sebastian's cubicle closes as well. The water runs in Sebastian's sink washing the blood away from his now half visible hands. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. HABITAT'S CORRIDOR - NEXT MORNING 
Sarah sees the dead dog lying prone on its bedding. She eyes it curiously and opens the cage door. 
INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - LATER 
Sarah stares at the empty chamber. 
SARAH You awake? 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE I am now. 
The sheets raise and drape off of him. 
SARAH Notice anything unusual last night. 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE No. Why? 
SARAH Franklin Three. He's dead. 
Sebastian pulls a sheet around him. He moves across the dimly lit room like a ghost. 
SEBASTIAN What of? 
SARAH His neck was broken and his windpipe collapsed. 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE How'd that happen? 
SARAH I thought maybe you could tell me. 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE Sarah... You saying I had something to do with it? 
SARAH He was alive last night when I left and he was dead this morning. And you were the only one down here. 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE I was in my room all night. 
INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY 
Sarah sits with Carter as they run through the security video tape. Matt and Linda look over their shoulder. 
CARTER That's all twelve hours. 
LINDA He never left the room. 
SARAH A windpipe doesn't just suddenly collapse. Someone or something killed it. 
MATT You saw the tape. The man was in his chamber. 
SARAH Then we have a problem, because I the cage was locked from the outside. That means it was opened, the dog was killed and the cage was closed and locked again. Only a human could do that. 
CARTER Well, it wasn't me. 
MATT And it wasn't him. 
LINDA Are we sure? 
INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - NIGHT 
Linda passes Sebastian's chamber. Sebastian's in latex. 
SEBASTIAN Any big plans for tonight? 
LINDA Quiet night at home. Maybe a book. 
SEBASTIAN Really? Whatever happened to that guy your were seeing? 
LINDA He's still in the picture. Why? 
SEBASTIAN Being locked down here, I'm forced to live vicariously. Someday you'll have to tell me what he's like. 
LINDA Maybe someday I will. See you in the morning. 
SEBASTIAN Au domain. 
LINDA Thank you, sir. 
MATT What do we do in the meantime? 
KRAMER Just sit tight and wait for my call. 
Matt and Linda head down to her car. Kramer heads back inside. 
INT. KRAMER'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Kramer heads back into the living room. His wife appears a the upstairs railing. 
MRS. KRAMER What was that about? 
KRAMER Just a little trouble at work. 
MRS. KRAMER You coming up? 
KRAMER In a minute. I have to make a few calls. 
Mrs. Kramer retreats back to her bedroom as Dr. Kramer crosses over to the telephone. He picks up the receiver and starts dialing. In the middle of dialing, the phone goes dead. He clicks the hookswitch up and down trying to get a dial tone. Nothing. He checks the connections on the phone and then follows the wiring to the wall. The line's plugged in. Weird. He hears a door creak open in the kitchen. 
KRAMER (cont'd) Hello? Hello? 
Kramer crosses to the darkened kitchen. The kitchen door leading to the backyard is open. Puzzled, he crosses to it. A wind stirs across the pool and backyard, swirling dead leaves in small twists of wind. The windchime rings lightly. Kramer steps out. 
EXT. POOL/PATIO, BACKYARD - NIGHT 
In the dim spillover light from house, Kramer crosses to the telephone- box against the back of the house. It Is open and several of the wires have been pulled. He looks around, spooked and puffs out a cloud of smoke from his pipe. For the briefest of instants, Sebastian's face is visible in the smoke. Kramer jumps back in surprise and the pipe drops from his mouth. He gives a small sharp cry, but deep indentations appear across his mouth and his cries are stifled. In the darkness, we can make out his form writhing as if possessed. The struggle continues a beat until Kramer manages to break free. 
KRAMER Help! HELP! MARTHA! HELP! 
As Kramer runs, he looks behind him. But no one's there. WHAM! Something slams into Kramer and he tumbles, rolling into the pool. But as he hits water there's not just one splash, but TWO. In the water next to him is human shaped AIR-POCKET. It's Sebastian displacing the water. And because of the water displacement, we can clearly see two arms pushing Kramer beneath the water's surface. 
MARTHA KRAMER opens the bedroom window and looks down at the pool. All she can see is her husband drowning... his flailing limbs kicking up a massive air bubble around him. She races from the window. Kramer kicks and flails for a few moments and then his limbs stop moving. A moment later he floats to surface, face down. The AIR POCKET bobs over to the pool ladder, and rising from the pool, we see Sebastian's body outlined in sheets of water. The shape melts away in a cascading waterfall until all we can see of Sebastian are the hundreds of tiny droplets still clinging to his body, caught in the light like twinkling bulbs on a Christmas tree. The shape disappears into the darkness. A moment later Martha emerges from the house and sees her husband floating face down in the pool. She screams. 
INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - DAY 
Linda passes by Sebastian's chamber. 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE What? No good morning for me? Don't you like me anymore? 
LINDA Oh, sorry. I...I'm in a hurry. 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE That's okay. It's going to be busy day. 
INT. LINDA'S OFFICE - DAY 
Matt sits across from her, twirling a pen in his hand. They both stare at the phone. 
LINDA When did he say held call? 
MATT He's probably meeting with the committee trying to figure out what to do. 
LINDA I'm gonna call him. 
Linda picks up the phone and dials. 
LINDA (cont'd) Yes, Dr. Kramer please. Excuse me? (inhales sharply - surprised) When? I'm so sorry. 
Linda blanches as she hangs up the phone. 
MATT What? 
LINDA He's dead. Drowned in his pool last night. 
Linda picks up the phone again and dials. 
LINDA (cont'd) Yes, General Thompson please. Thank you. 
As she waits the phone line clicks dead. 
LINDA (cont'd) Hello? Hello? 
She clicks on the hookswitch. 
MATT Let me see that. 
He tries it too. Same result. 
MATT (cont'd) Intercom's working, but there doesn't seem to be an outside line. 
INT. CORRIDOR/ELEVATOR 
They waste no time getting to the elevator. Linda and Matt step in. 
LINDA Okay, Sebastian. Fun's over. Tell us where you are. 
She waits. Then... 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE I'm sorry. But I can't lot you turn me in. 
LINDA Sebastian... where are you? 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (INTERCOM) You have no idea what it's like. The power of it. The freedom. I can't let that go. 
LINDA C'mon Sebastian. You're scaring me. Tell me where you are and we can talk about it. 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (INTERCOM) There's nothing to talk about. See ... I've done things that can't be undone. 
A long beep as the intercom clicks off. 
LINDA Sebastian! Sebastian! (beat) I want search parties. Thermal goggles and tranquilizers. 
INT. CORRIDOR 
Linda and Matt, wearing thermal goggles and clutching tranquilizer pistols, walk down the hallway, scanning back and forth. 
INT. SEBASTIAN'S OFFICE 
Janice enters the office. 
JANICE Dr. Caine? Are you in here? Dr. Caine? 
Suddenly, Janice jerks back. 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE I'm here. 
INT. HABITAT'S CORRIDOR 
Sarah scans all the habitats with a thermal scanner. Listening intently. 
INT. SEBASTIAN'S OFFICE 
Janice struggles with her unseen assailant, slamming into walls and knocking into filing cabinets. 
INT. LABORATORY 
Frank and Carter search the lab with their thermal scopes. 
FRANK Doctor Caine? 
INT. SEBASTIAN'S OFFICE 
Linda and Matt knock. 
LINDA Sebastian? 
No response. They push through the door. The room seems deserted. Signs of a struggle. File cabinets opened, drawers tossed. 
MATT This is bad. 
THERMAL POV - Linda surveys the room, spotting a slight heat signature peeking from the corner. 
LINDA There's something over there. 
Linda moves toward it. Whatever it is its hidden from Matt's POV by the supply cabinet. As Linda gets close she pulls of f her thermal goggles to see... 
JANICE - 
Her face blue, eyes bulging. An I.V. cord wrapped around his neck. Linda jumps back. 
LINDA (cont'd) Jesus. Oh my god. 
Matt rushes over. Sees the lifeless corpse. 
MATT What happened? 
Linda lowers the body to the floor. 
LINDA She was strangled. Multiple blows to her head. 
Linda begins a medical check of the rest of the body. Matt stoops down and examines Janice's face. 
LINDA (cont'd) We got a big problem here. 
A lamp tumbles from the desk and smashes to the floor. Both Linda and Matt jump. Linda frantically dons the thermal visor and scopes the room again. Nothing. Matt notices the lamp cord beneath Linda's leg. Points it out to her. She sighs with relief... she pulled the lamp off the table. 
LINDA (cont'd) Get everybody to the conference room. Now! 
Matt picks up the phone. Clicks the hookswitch. Clicks the hookswitch again. 
INT. TUNNEL 
Matt and Linda push along the corridor; Matt spraying with the fire extinguisher in short controlled bursts, Linda clutching her tranquilizer like a commando. 
A noise behind them. Footsteps. 
Matt turns to blast with the extinguisher. The white chemical dust sprays out, outlining a shape in the tunnel. But it isn't a human shape. 
Matt's uniform shreds. Something with fierce sharp claws fells him. Tearing into his flesh. We see a angry, hungry face... jabbing for a moment through the lingering fog. 
MATT Ahh!  Shit! 
Linda tries to get a clear shot off through the smoke. Matt trips and goes sprawling. Something yelps. A howl. Linda shoots. Her dart jabs into something which collapses to the ground. A moment of calm. As the dusty chemical foam settles, the outline of a great ape appears, still twitching. 
MATT (cont'd) Karl Three. Nice shot. 
LINDA He's let the animals out. It wasn't him we were tracking. 
Linda leans against the wall, still clutching her tranq gun at the ready. The heat is getting to bar. Bar scrubs are soaked, her hair's a mess. She wipes the sweat from her brow. 
LINDA (cont'd) You okay? 
MATT It won't kill me unless it gets infected. You? 
LINDA Me .... Don't ask about me. If he freed all the animals, we could have dozens running around the lab. 
MATT So he could be anywhere right now. 
Matt sprays the whole tunnel, putting down a gentle cloud mist. Nothing else appears. 
MATT (cont'd) What do we do? 
LINDA Get to the lab, lock the goddamn doors and pray to God Frank can reprogram the elevator. 
INT. SUPPLY ROOM 
Sarah finishes collecting blood bags and shuts the door to the fridge/freezer. 
The DOOR SLAMS behind her. She freezes and slowly turns. 
SARAH Frank? 
She eyes the supply room, looking for a sign of movement. 
SARAH (cont'd) (frightened whisper) Who's there? 
She listens. Is that breathing she hears? Now she's starting to panic. 
SARAH (cont'd) Dr. Caine? 
She starts to back away, but she's already in the corner. She clutches her tranquilizer gun, but there's nothing to aim at. The vials of blood on the shelf gives her an idea. She reaches over, grabs a vial and throws it on the floor. GLASS SHATTERS and BLOOD SMEARS across the linoleum. Sarah tosses another vial and another. Becoming more and more hysterical. Splattering more and more blood. But she runs out of vials. Shaking with fear, she searches the blood looking for a footprint, or movement. But there's nothing there. Sarah waits a beat, clutching the tranquilizer gun. Takes a step. Waits a beat longer. 
Finally she relaxes. It was just her imagination. She heads toward the door when she hears a terrifying whisper in her ear. 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE You missed. 
Her hair flies up, and she swings against the wall. She tries to move, but she's pinned there. Her hands struggling against the force. 
SARAH Please no. Let me go. Oh god, let me go. 
The arm holding the tranquilizer gun begins to move. 
SARAH (cont'd) What are you doing? No! 
Sarah fights, but her arm moves nonetheless 
SARAH (cont'd) Help me! Oh God. Somebody help me! FRANK! 
Slowly, deliberately, her own arm moves down the wall and around, until the tranquilizer gun points right at her stomach. 
Sarah watches in horror as her own body betrays her. 
SARAH (cont'd) No... please. Don't do this to me. 
She struggles, shaking back and forth. Writhing. In anguish and in fear. 
SARAH (cont'd) What do you want? 
SEBASTIAN You. 
The trigger pulls .... Pop! 
A dart explodes from the gun and imbeds in Sarah's stomach. She whimpers as her eyes glass over. Suddenly she's released. She stumbles backward and falls lifeless to the floor. A moment of stillness, all we can hear is the sound of someone breathing. 
On Sarah's face... a slight-indentation runs down her cheek.. 
INSIDE THE FREEZER 
Through the porthole, Linda sees the bloody footprints heading toward the door. She removes the metal bar and pushes on the door. It won't move. 
LINDA Goddamnit. 
Linda looks around the storage room. She grabs a roll of duct tape and pulls off a length. 
MATT What're you doing? 
LINDA This is temporary. 
She takes paper towel and cleans off Matt's wound. She tapes it, using duct tape. 
LINDA (cont'd) You still with me? 
MATT Barely. 
A beat later, the compressor begins pumping Arctic air into the freezer. 
LINDA Just keeps getting worse. 
Linda returns to the door. Shakes it. 
INT. CHAMBER - DAY 
We hear WHISTLING as we see a sheet of flesh fill out into a head as Sebastian slides on his latex head piece. 
INT. STORAGE FREEZER 
Linda continues shaking the door. The lock holds. A tear rolls down Linda's cheek, but a strange thing happens. The tear drops freeze. Linda shivers as she pulls the icy tears from her face. 
LINDA Oh shit. 
The inside thermometer has dropped to five degrees. 
Linda grabs the metal bar and starts smashing it against the porthole. The metal bar just bounces off the glass. 
INT. SEBASTIAN'S OFFICE 
A drawer opens, revealing a set of clothing neatly folded. Shirt, pants, shoes. They begin to move. 
INT. STORAGE FREEZER 
Linda drops the metal bar and slides down the wall, defeated. 
MATT There's no way out. 
LINDA There's got to be. 
MATT They say freezing to death isn't so bad. You just kinda pass out. 
Matt's head rolls back. 
LINDA Matt! MATT! 
She checks his pulse. Thank god he still has one, but he's not gonna last long. They're both already starting to turn a little blue. Linda stares desperately up at the shelves, trying to find some sort of advantage. Then she sees something. She looks back at the door lock and then she rises ... and grabs AN EXTENSION CORD coiled on the shelf. 
LINDA (cont'd) We're not dying in here. 
INT. BATHROOM - DAY 
Sebastian, dressed in street clothes, stands before the mirror applying make-up to his latex mask. 
INT. STORAGE FREEZER 
Linda finishes stripping the insulation off the electric cord. 
She grabs a hypodermic needle package, and her cold fingers fumbles with the package as she tries to pull out the plastic tube. 
She finally gets it out and she starts wrapping the stripped electric wire around the tube in a tight coil. 
INT. BATHROOM - DAY 
Sebastian slides on a wig and checks his appearance in the mirror. Pretty smooth. Even from relatively close up, he could pass as normal. 
INT. STORAGE FREEZER 
Linda furiously winds wire into a coil. 
INT. CORRIDOR 
Sebastian heads down the corridor. Lingering steam twists in and around the hallway, long wispy tendrils. Sebastian pauses for a moment, hearing A GROWL. Suddenly the hallway seems a lot scarier. From beneath his scrubs he pulls his own tranq gun. He listens ... hearing scraping and footsteps. Watching the water on the floor twitch. With machine like precision, he turns and fires. The tranq dart halts in mid-air and some invisible thing tumbles over. 
Sebastian continues down the hallway. 
LINDA You wanna see God? I'll show you God. 
Linda turns the corner to see a heap of smoldering latex and clothing strewn about the corridor floor. Sebastian, looking like some ugly creature, pushes down the corridor. He throbs with his blackened skin blistering and cracking up and down his body. Linda lets loose another jet of flame. It's smaller than the first and doesn't quite hit Sebastian. Linda checks the tanks pressure gauge. It slowly drops. Linda follows the blackened horror into the maze of tunnels. But as he pushes along the corridor, his burns slowly re- absorb themselves. Sebastian is no longer visible. A quiet moment in the hallway as Linda realizes how vulnerable she is. She looks around for him desperately. Nothing. But something on the ceiling catches her attention. She blasts it with the last jet of her dying torch. THE SPRINKLER SYSTEM, hit by fire, comes to life. Water sprays down on the tunnel. Sebastian is caught in the downpour, his invisible frame outlined by water. It comes toward her, the hot skin steaming in the water. He grabs Linda and slams her against the wall. His watery hand smashes her across her face. Linda reels. On the floor, she looks to see Sebastian stalking toward her. She crawls away, but he grabs her by her hair, pulls her to her feet and slams her against the wall. 
SEBASTIAN I'm gonna find everyone in your family and kill them-. Your sister... she never liked me. I think I'll go after her and her little boy first. 
Sebastian smashes her head against a metal post. Her head cuts open, blood dripping down. 
SEBASTIAN (cont'd) I just wanted you to know that before you die. 
Linda collapses to the floor. Sebastian's foot presses against her neck, squeezing it. Linda gags for breath. But through the shoot of water that is Sebastian, we see something also... a watery smudge. 
BAM! 
MATT - smashes Sebastian with the metal bar. Sebastian slams against the corridor wall and sinks down. 
Matt staggers. It's taken all his strength to got there. He drops the crowbar and seeks the wall for support, he sinks to his knees by Linda. 
MATT Thought I'd... thought I'd save you for a change. 
He gives her his hand and pulls her up into his arms. 
MATT (cont'd) Let's got out of here. 
Just as the two turn, Sebastian rises with the crowbar. He swings it with a yell. Matt pushes Linda out of the way, his arm glancing the blow into a conduit. The conduit splits open and severs ELECTRICAL wiring. The VOLTAGE shoots up the crowbar and into Sebastian. As the current pulses through his body, Sebastian vibrates. His blood vessels yank back to visibility, followed by his skeletal structure and major organs. Sebastian is slowly electrified. Smoke pours off him and he becomes more and more visible. Finally he collapses. His body throbbing in and out of visibility. Matt and Linda stumble away. 
INT. CORRIDOR - DAY 
Just outside the lab... Linda tries to pry open the sealed doors with the crowbar. But she can't. 
Through the doors porthole she sees a collection of chemicals and the fire raging from the earlier explosion. 
LINDA Nitro... 
Matt peaks inside. 
MATT He said it himself... All they'll find is a pile of charred corpses. 
She sees the centrifuge... The timed counter on its face counts down from a minute. Fifty nine. Fifty eight. Fifty seven... 
LINDA He's rigged the centrifuge. 
MATT In an enclosed space, he'll wipe out the whole lab. 
INT. TUNNEL 
Linda and Matt move as fast as they can. They reach the burned out elevator. What the hell are they gonna do? We know the damn thing doesn't work. She swings her crowbar at the ceiling. The maintenance hatch comes down. 
LINDA Grab on. 
Linda hooks the crowbar onto the hatch lip and pulls herself up. She reaches back down for Matt. 
MATT Forget about me. You go. 
LINDA Fuck you. Give me your hands. 
Linda grabs Matt's hands and pulls for all she's worth. She struggles, but they both manage to got him through the hatch. 
INT. LABORATORY - DAY 
Three... two... one. The centrifuge springs to life. 
The centrifuge spins the two dozen vials slowly at first. 
INT. VENT 
Linda and Matt are on top of the elevator. 
Linda's hands search the wall. Bar fingers run across the smooth metal surface. 
From the little light below she can see a maintenance ladder that spans the entire height of the vertical tube. They look up and see it disappear into the darkness. 
LINDA Climb! 
MATT But... 
LINDA Climb! 
Matt starts up, rung after rung. Linda climbs right behind him. 
INT. LABORATORY 
The centrifuge spins faster and faster. The vials are starting to rattle. 
INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT

EXT. MOUNTAIN CLEARING - A LITTLE LATER 
A Pave Hawk SH-60 helicopter, rotors whirling slowly, waits. Shane's chopper appears from behind a tree line and sets down atop the mountain by a stream. 
Shane and Charles sprint from the chopper towards the waiting Hawk. Charles stops Shane. 
CHARLES Lieutenant, thank you. (He pats his briefcase) You saved more than just my life today. Can I call my wife to let her know I'm okay? 
SHANE Negative. Not imperative to the mission. We have to keep moving. I have strict orders to get you out of here safely. 
CHARLES I'm safe, Lieutenant. Please. She thinks I'm dead. (then) Don't you have a family? 
SHANE (this gets him:) Make it quick. 
Charles picks up his briefcase. He holds the lock up to his mouth and whispers into it: 
CHARLES Joe, Todd, Lulu, Peter, Tyler. 
The briefcase pops open. Shane looks at him, puzzled. 
CHARLES (CONT'D) My kids. It's voice activated. Designed it myself. I do security, that's my specialty. (gestures back:) Those guys back there tried to get this case open for five days -- couldn't crack it. And you should see what happens to you if open it without the code. I have a picture of my kids in here, you want to see it? 
SHANE Negative. 
Charles takes a cell-phone out of the case. Shane looks in the case: it's EMPTY, except for the phone and a family PHOTO. Charles dials his cell phone... nothing 
CHARLES Battery's dead... 
Shane considers, then hands him his satellite phone. Charles dials, and talks... 
CHARLES (CONT'D) Honey, I'm alive... 
INT. PAVE HAWK - CONTINUOUS 
Shane climbs in the Hawk and approaches the cockpit.    The PILOT sits, back to him. 
SHANE We're almost ready.    Just gives us a - 
The Pilot slumps forward... DEAD. Shane turns- 
SHANE (CONT'D) Professor, RUN!!! 
WHAM.   Shane drops, knocked unconscious.   All goes black. 
EXT. PAVE HAWK - MOMENTS LATER 
The helicopter is on fire. Wolf lies facedown in the stream. He looks around, barely conscious. 
SHANE'S P.O.V.: Everything is a blur, in slow-motion. He sees Charles, unconscious. A Huey Helicopter lands. A VERY TALL MAN steps out, and takes Charles' Briefcase. There is huge explosion, as the chopper ignites. Everything is ablaze. Shane reaches out, grabs the picture of Charles' kids then goes unconscious. F ADE TO BLACK: 
EST. HOSPITAL - DAY 
TITLE CARD: 1 Month Later 
INT. HOSPITAL - DAY 
Shane lies in a hospital bed, despondent. His arm and face bandaged. 
Shane's Captain enters: BILL FAWCETT (35) -- friendly, unassuming. He looks like he hasn't slept in days. Shane salutes him with his bandaged arm -- it hurts to salute, but he does it anyway. 
SHANE Captain, sir. 
BILL As you were Lieutenant. 
Bill sits down beside the bed. He takes a long look at Shane. He holds a REPORT in his hand. 
BILL (CONT'D) We've been through a lot together Shane. You're the best man I ever trained. And a good friend. 
SHANE ... I know sir. And I except full responsibility for the mission's failure. 
BILL Why the hell did you let him use the satellite phone? 
SHANE He had to call his family. A lapse in judgement on my part that I regret sir. 
Bill shakes his head, disappointed. He pulls up a chair, and sits opposite Shane. 
BILL ... Plummer was the best security expert the department of defense ever had -- a genius. He was working on a program that scrambles launch codes. He called it G.H.O.S.T.: Guided High-altitude Scrambling Transmitter. One pulse from the GHOST satellite and a country can't launch its own nukes. That's what the Serbians kidnapped him for, but they couldn't get S inside the briefcase. 
SHANE The case was empty sir, as I stated in my report. 
Bill considers this. Then... 
BILL Not a surprise, really. Not like the professor to hide things where someone might look for them. G.H.O.S.T. is still out there, (Bill smiles:) which is why I'm going to give you another shot. 
JULIE And this is Helga and Tyler. 
Shane nods hello to them. 
SHANE (official:) Ma'am... Baby. 
JULIE Kids, go finish your homework.   And I'll be checking. 
Zoe, Lulu and Todd climb back up the stairs. Julie leads Shane into... 
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Julie sits, Shane stands "at ease" (which doesn't look "at ease" at all). 
SHANE You have a pleasant family, ma'am. 
JULIE Charles wasn't around too much. His work took him all over the world. He'd be gone six or seven months at a time. So I think for the younger ones it's a little confusing. Zoe and Todd... well, they're dealing like your normal teenagers. Maybe in Todd's case semi-normal. 
SHANE Mrs. Plummer, I have to tell you that I did everything I could... 
JULIE Charles was in a dangerous business. I knew it when I married him. No one's to blame here. (beat) Everyone thinks that Charles told me or the kids where he hid it. And until G.H.O.S.T. is found, we're all in danger. 
SHANE Nothing will happen to your family as long as I'm here. I've dealt with much... 
Suddenly from behind Shane's head a DUCK appears and NIBBLES his ear. Shane spins in full fight stance. He sees the Duck... and relaxes. Sort of. 
JULIE That's Gary. He was Charles'. 
The duck QUACKS angrily. Confused, Shane returns to "at ease," keeping one eye on the duck. 
SHANE Mrs. Plummer- 
JULIE Call me Julie. 
Beat. 
SHANE ... Mrs. Plummer, I'll go secure the perimeter. 
JULIE I'm glad you're here- 
But Shane is already gone. 
CUT TO: 
MONTAGE. MILITARY MUSIC PLAYS: 
Shane secures the area.       He paces off the yard. 
He mounts surveillance cameras in the eaves. 
He attaches contact alarms in the doors and windows. 
Shane climbs a telephone pole, opens the circuit box and TAPS the phones. 
Shane, now wearing an EAR TRANSMITTER, crawls through the shrubs, hiding electric eyes. 
Nighttime -- the family eats dinner. We slowly pull out... through the kitchen window... and reveal Shane with night vision goggles on scoping the property. 
The phone RINGS inside. Through the window, Julie casually answers it. Shane touches his ear transmitter and LISTENS as he walks into the house. 
BILL (o.s.) Julie, it's Bill Fawcett. I have some potentially good news. 
JULIE What is it? 
BILL (o.s.) A safety deposit box under Charles' name was just found in Switzerland. I think it could contain GHOST. 
JULIE That's wonderful. This could all be over! 
BILL (o.s.) There's a catch. Swiss law says only his family can access it. I'm going to need you on a plane tomorrow morning. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Shane, listening to the conversation, enters- 
JULIE I'll be there. 
Julie and Shane share a look. 
INT. PLUMMER HOUSE/FOYER - MORNING 
Julie, with her suitcase, Shane, Helga and the Kids stand in the doorway. Zoe listens to her I-Pod ignoring the hug Julie gives her. 
JULIE Don't worry about the Kids, Helga will handle everything. (Worried:) But if there is an emergency, all the emergency numbers are on the fridge. And on the phone. And on the back door... 
MR. CHUN (perfect English, no accent) We speak English, Kojak. 
SHANE Oh. Sorry. 
MRS. CHUN ... Look, about the 2000 decibel alarm and the kleig lights and stuff... we own a bakery, so we're up kind of early. Would you mind? 
SHANE Sorry. 
Shane pulls a remote control from his pocket and clicks it. The alarm stops. 
MR. CHUN Thanks a bunch. Oh, and we found this in our pool filter... Try to keep that zoo reigned in, huh baby-sitter? 
Mr. Chun tosses him the TROLL DOLL and slam their window shut. Shane's about to head inside, he pulls a tiny camera phone from his pocket, and snaps a shot of the Chun's car in their driveway. I INT. PLUMMER HOUSE - NIGHT 
hane marches Zoe up the stairs. Loud, angry rock music blares from Todd's room. 
SHANE Your mother thought you were in real danger. You should have told her the truth. 
ZOE Who do you think you are -- my dad? 
Zoe starts to turn -- then suddenly spins and tries kicking him in the CROTCH. But Shane catches her foot -- and whirls her away. She has to hop on one foot, to not fall over. He "hops" her down the hall to her room. 
S W 
ZOE (CONT'D) Let me go! It's Saturday night.   I have plans! 
Zoe's back to her door, Shane flips her foot in the air. Zoe falls backwards into the room. Shane shuts her door. 
SHANE Not anymore. 
Shane marches back down the hall, bangs on Todd's door- 
SHANE (CONT'D) Lights out. 
TODD (o.s.) Bite me! 
Shane frowns, continues down the hall. He passes the NURSERY (Peter and Tyler's room), where Helga is singing a lullaby: (as annoying Has something Barney might sing). 
ELGA When you're down and low, lower than the floor. And you feel like you ain't got a chance. Don't make a move `til you're in the groove, and do the Peter Panda Dance. Just hop three times like a kangaroo -- 
She does a little "dance" that goes with the lullaby: She hops forwards three times, then "crab-walks" sideways. 
HELGA (CONT'D) Sidestep twice, just like the crabs do. Three steps forward, one step back. 
She does. The Children, in bed -- laugh and laugh. 
HELGA (CONT'D) Then quick like a turtle lie on your back! riggle like a snake `til you can't no more. 
he wriggles on the floor. Then jumps up, to their beds. Shane shakes his head, keeps walking- 
SHANE This family's in for a rude awakening.

OE Huh?   Wha--?! 
INT. TODD'S ROOM - MORNING 
Todd sits up, disoriented, not understanding what's happening. The Whistle GETS LOUDER. Suddenly his door flies open -- and Shane strides in with a BOOM BOX. Todd blinks groggily. 
TODD W-what are you doing??! 
SHANE You're burning daylight. Move.       Move. 
The bathroom door opens, and Todd comes sauntering back. He sees Shane, the destroyed door and wall... 
SHANE All I need is a hammer and some plaster of Paris. I can fix this. 
A piece of the ceiling falls, hits Shane on the head. 
TODD Can I get by? 
Embarrassed, Shane steps aside, then mutters- 
SHANE Here's your bracelet. If you'd been wearing it, this wouldn't have happened. 
Shane SNAPS it onto Todd's wrist, and head down the hall, patrolling. Zoe comes up the stairs, to her room. She stops at Todd's door -- they glare at Shane. 
ZOE He has to go. 
Todd nods in agreement. 
INT. PLUMMER HOUSE - MORNING - LATER S hane does one-handed push ups in the living room while the Duck watches. With his other hand he loads the PHOTO of the Chun's license plate into his laptop computer. His head shifts, he hears something suspicious -- the rumble of a car approaching. 
L 
S 
He rushes for the front door, clicks his alarm remote and opens it, just as -- WHACK -- the MORNING PAPER connects with his face, hard. From off-screen we hear a PAPERBOY. 
PAPERBOY (O.S.) SORRY DUDE! 
Shane rubs his nose. Lulu screams at the top of her lungs. Shane turns, to see that Peter is chasing her, wearing a towel as a sheet. He pretends to be a ghost. 
PETER Whhhoooooo! 
LULU Stop it, Peter! 
Lulu hides behind Shane. Peter Booos again. Lulu screams. 
SHANE Hey, hey, good soldiers aren't afraid of anything. 
LULU This house is haunted. Daddy even said so. He said there's a ghost. 
And then it hits Shane.       His eyes light up. 
SHANE Really?   And where is this ghost? 
ULU I don't know.     I've never seen it. 
INT. HALLWAY - LATER 
Shane walks slowly down the hall. As he walks he glides his hands along the wall, feeling, pushing, scanning the ceiling. Searching. I INT. STAIRWAY - SAME TIME 
Todd and Zoe kneel on the stairs. They surreptitiously pour COOKING OIL all over the wood. 
Then -- a creak. Zoe whispers. 
ZOE Here he comes...! 
Zoe and Todd run downstairs and hide behind the couch. 
F 
Shane strides to the top step and RAPS on the wall. He RAPS again, listening for hollow spaces. Nothing. Shane lifts his left foot out to take a step down... 
When he hears an alert from his laptop. He goes back to the living room, then turns his attention to his laptop. MR. Chun's photo appears next to a VEHICLE REGISTRATION. Shane scans it... 
Todd and Zoe's faces fall. The footsteps again- 
TODD He's coming back- 
But Helga, carrying a huge laundry basket, appears, takes a step onto the stairs -- 
HELGA AHHH!!! 
BUMP! BUMP! BUMP! She flies down the greased stairs, BANGING her head and ass on each step, all the way down. 
inally, BAM! Helga HITS the bottom with a mighty crash. She screams, as laundry flutters down from above. T IGHT - ZOE AND TODD 
They gulp, terrified. 
ZOE Uh-oh.

His jaw drops in disbelief. He drops his head, defeated. Then -- he slowly glances up. 
ACROSS THE STREET 
The Korean couple is staring at him, dumbfounded. 
KOREAN WOMAN Don't worry, if she loves you, she'll come back. 
ANGLE - SHANE 
Rises, takes a deep breath and strides inside. 
INT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
Shane enters... to find the kids are all gloomy.    The baby cries. Shane awkwardly picks the baby up. 
SHANE Okay, listen up. There's been a change of plans. Your mom's not coming back as soon as she thought... 
LULU (worried) When is she coming back? 
SHANE Soon. In the meantime, we're just gonna have some more big fun. 
TODD That's what we've been doing? 
LULU But tomorrow's a school day. 
ZOE I need a signed release for Driver's Ed! 
LULU I've got Brownies! 
Shane reacts, inundated. 
SHANE Whoa, WHOA! HALT! We'll take this hill one inch at a time. Only then can we rise to the challenge. All for one, and one for all! 
LULU (singing) "Be all that you can be!" 
SHANE That's Army. I'm Navy.     But I appreciate your enthusiasm. 
nice moment.   Until -- FWRPPPP! 
SHANE (CONT'D) Tell me that was the duck? 
FWRPPP!    WE zoom in on the baby's leering face. 
hane quickly moves the Baby away from his body. Pure self-preservation, everyone bolts from the room. 
SHANE (CONT'D) Hey.   HEY! 
Nobody will help.     Even Peter runs, holding his nose. 
CLOSE-UP - SHANE 
He gulps. 
INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Shane enters, holding out the Baby at full arm's length. He lowers Tyler onto a changing pad, takes a deep breath, then pulls out PLIERS and a SCREWDRIVER. Using the tools as chopsticks, he cautiously unfastens the diaper... And then -- it flops open. SShane GROANS, repelled. 
SHANE The things I do for my country. 
Shane tries approaching -- he can't do it. Aghast, he looks around for a solution. Then: Shane picks up the Baby and dips the bottom half in the toilet, then FLUSHES, over and over and over. 
INT.   HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Shane patrols the hall, making sure all the doors and windows are locked. Lulu is in her pj's. 
A hand tugs on Shane's shirt, he looks down to see Lulu. 
LULU Hi. Zoe thinks you look like the Hulk. I think you're cute. 
SHANE (unsure how to respond...) Thank you. 
Lulu doesn't go away, she just stares at him, it starts making Shane uncomfortable. 
LULU Do you know Kung Fu? 
SHANE Affirmative. 
LULU Did you ever punch someone so hard that their head came off? 
hane walks away from Lulu. She follows. Shane is again twirling the MEDAL in his fingers. Lulu follows at his heels, like a puppy. 
The car speeds out of the drive, backwards at sixty m.p.h.. It does a skidding 180 and heads down the street. 
EXT. EAST BETHESDA K-12 SCHOOL - 9:29 A.M. 
A big suburban school, Busses and PARENTS are parked at the curb, STUDENTS of all ages are hurrying inside. The Minivan skids completely sideways, into a TINY parking spot -- a death defying, perfect parallel park. 
INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER 
CLOSE UP ON: a stopwatch. It hits ZERO, and at that moment, the SCHOOL'S BELL RINGS. 
Holding the stopwatch is the VICE PRINCIPAL MURNEY (50's). He's HUGE and mean. 
MURNEY I always said these kids didn't need a baby sitter, they needed a parole officer. Looks like Mrs. Plummer finally listened. 
He glares at Shane, and the Kids: Shane sits with Tyler in a Snuggle, holding Peter on a harness, as he plays on the floor. The Kids are seated around him, mortified. 
MURNEY (CONT'D) (To Shane) What's your name, son? 
SHANE Wolfe. Shane. Lieutenant. I'm in charge of watching these kids for... a few days. 
Murney is unimpressed. 
MURNEY aby-sitter huh. Well, whatever work you can get. I'm Murphy. Duane. V.P in charge of discipline, conduct and truancy. Top to bottom, K thru 12. You're in my house now, boy. I coach wrestling, too. (re: Todd:) And the creeper here played hookey from every wrestling practice this month. 
The Kids crack up. Murney is furious. 
MURNEY (CONT'D) She's missed twenty-two Driver's Ed classes. Out of twenty-three. They're the worst students in my school. 
OMAN'S VOICE Your school? 
Murney grimaces as PRINCIPAL CLAIRE NELSON (early 30's) enters. She's attractive, assured, tough. He withers. 
PRINCIPAL CLAIRE Good morning kids. What are you doing in my office, Murney? 
MURNEY I was explaining, that as vice principal, I am in charge of.... 
PRINCIPAL CLAIRE Very little. I thought I asked you to find out who stuck to the baloney slices to the cafeteria ceiling with mustard? 
MURNEY I'm got some leads. (then, confidential:) My informant's about to crack. 
PRINCIPAL CLAIRE Then hop to it. I think I can handle this from here. 
The opens the door for Murney. He exits, fuming.     The BELL rings. 
SHANE Red 1, Red 2. Get moving. 
The teens hustle off to their classes. Shane checks his TRACKER -- two little red DOTS move away. Good. 
Principal Claire eyeballs him... staring him up and down, as he casually holds the three kids. 
PRINCIPAL CLAIRE So. You're the new baby-sitter? 
SHANE Bodyguard. You see, Mrs. Plummer called my captain, she thought the kids needed - 
PRINCIPAL CLAIRE It's okay, Lieutenant, I was briefed of the situation by Mrs. Plummer. She told me all about you. 
She notices NAVY SEAL tattoo on his upper arm. Claire sees this -- and suddenly reacts, impressed. 
PRINCIPAL CLAIRE (CONT'D) Lieutenant, huh? You with "The Teams?" (Shane nods.) Petty Officer Third Class Claire Nelson at your service. 
SHANE ... You're kidding? 
PRINCIPAL CLAIRE Four years at Naval base Coronado.   The Service paid for my college. 
Shane stares not sure whether to believe. On the spot, Claire looks nervously around. She lifts her pants leg... revealing a tiny ANCHOR TATTOO on her ankle. 
SHANE "Honor, Courage... 
PRINCIPAL CLAIRE Commitment". That's the way I live my life, and the way I run my school. 
SHANE Can't be too careful. So. Permission to stick around and keep eyes on the kids? 
She smiles. 
PRINCIPAL CLAIRE Permission granted. Welcome aboard. Just try not to frighten the children. 
SHANE No one will even notice I'm here. 
JUMP CUT TO: 
EXT. EAST BETHESDA K-12 SCHOOL - MID-MORNING 
Shane, dead serious, (Tyler in Snuggle) is riding the see- saw in the school's playground. Peter rides on the other side with a group of KIDS, to balance Shane. Shane types on his laptop: CLAIRE NELSON. A picture of Claire in a Naval uniform pops up as well as her stats... 
Shane, back in "uniform," paces in front of the Brownie Troop. They are assembled, at attention, Indian Style. 
SHANE Alright, ladies. Here's how it's gonna be. Tonight, I'm gonna be your den -- commander. That means if you want to live to see tomorrow, do as I say. DO WE UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER? 
The Brownies stare art him in stunned silence. 
BROWNIE Den Mother? ... I'm scared of you. 
SHANE Good. Now -- wait here. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - A LITTLE LATE 
The Brownies are in the living room, unpacking boxes of cookies, getting ready to go. Zoe's on the phone. 
ZOE ... yeah, he's a total psycho. I think mom found him from one of those Tough Love boot camps or something... 
Shane blows passed her, revving a cordless POWER DRILL. 
VARIOUS SHOTS: As Shane uses the drill to seal every window and door. He's not just locking them -- he's SCREWING THEM SHUT WITH DRYWALL SCREWS. 
INT. ZOE'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Shane's finishing up the last window. 
ZOE This is totally cruel and unusual! You can't do this -- we could run out of air! 
Shane lifts her window so it's open a HALF INCH, then drills it into place. Shane ushers the Troop out the door, then loads Peter and Tyler into TWO SNUGGLES -- one attached to his front, the other to his back. Shane closes the front door and attaches a "Club" lock to it. 
EXT. DRIVEWAY - MOMENTS LATER 
Shane Loads the brownies and toddlers into the minivan. 
As the minivan pulls out of the driveway, the camera CRANES up to... 
ZOE'S WINDOW: 
Inside, Zoe picks up the phone, hits speed-dial. 
ZOE .. he's got us on lock-down, it's like Oz or something. No, not munchkin Oz -- HBO Oz. (she listens:) Hm... I dunno if that's a good idea, Scott... 
EXT. GROCERY STORE - PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON 
Shane pulls the minivan into the crowded parking lot -- the Brownies are all singing 99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall at the top of their lungs. 
EXT. GROCERY STORE - MOMENTS LATER 
Shane (double-Snuggled) helps the Brownies set up a card table to display their cookies. 
SHANE I gotta get supplies. I can see you through the window, but if anything happens... 
LULU (flashing her bracelet) I know. 
INT. GROCERY STORE - MOMENTS LATER 
Shane watches the Brownies on the store's CLOSED CIRCUIT monitor, as he pushes a cart into the store. He looks around at the bright, colorful boxes of Children's Cereals, Rainbow Fruit Roll-Ups, Snack packs... NOTHING looks familiar -- nothing even looks like food. 
He sees: a huge, 100 pack VALUE CASE of SPAM. He smiles. Tyler looks at him -- "what are you, nuts?" 
EXT. GROCERY STORE - CONTINUOUS 
The Brownies are trying to sell the cookies, but they're very shy. SHOPPERS blow passed them without even noticing them. One of the Brownies spots something... 
BROWNIE Oh no... they're back. 
SLOW MOTION: In a shot out of Reservoir Dogs, we see who she means: A group of bad ass, chubby CUB SCOUTS. They're headed straight towards the cookie table, menacingly. 
UGLY CUB SCOUT (to another Scout) Hey Skeever, what's stinky and floats `til you flush `em? 
2ND SCOUT Brownies? 
The Scouts cackle. The Ugly Scout yanks a box of cookies away from Lulu. He rips it open, dumping the cookies on the ground and grinding Uthem with his foot. 
UGLY CUB SCOUT This is Troop 16 territory. How are we supposed to sell raffle tickets when this place reeks of your skanky cookies? 
2ND SCOUT BEAT IT, before I get my face punching badge on you. 
The Brownies take off running, clutching their boxes. One of the Scouts grabs Lulu -- she tugs and tugs, but can't get away. Finally, the Cub Scout takes her SCARF. He laughs, and lets her go. The Cub Scouts high-five. 
EXT. GROCERY STORE - MOMENTS LATER 
Shane heads to the Brownie's table -- but Lulu and the Brownies are gone. In their place are the Chubby Scouts. 
SHANE Where are my troops? 
SHANE (re: the Snuggle) You don't have a baby on your chest... 
Lulu's having fun now, she's just avoiding Shane's fighter, dancing, jumping, while he pounds the buttons, swinging and missing... Shane's really fuming. 
LULU You're not even trying... 
SHANE I AM TOO TRYING. 
LULU Too slow... come on -- take a shot... oops too slow... swing and a miss... 
She keeps dancing. It's really annoying. Shane's working the joy stick hard, slamming buttons, but he can't hit her. He is KO'd. She does a very obnoxious VICTORY DANCE. 
LULU (CONT'D) In your face! I am the greatest hand-to- hand combat champion in the entire world! 
Shane screams and RIPS THE JOYSTICK OFF THE MACHINE. Sparks fly. Shane looks around to see if the staff noticed. He and the Brownies sneak away, leaving the sizzling machine, its joystick dangling by its wires.

As Zoe hangs up, we WIDEN OUT: The house is PACKED with TEENAGERS: they're keeping quiet until the phone is in its cradle, then the TEENAGE DJ starts the music back up. 
Zoe looks around at the mess. She turns to Scott, who doesn't seem concerned at all. 
ZOE Dude, this is outta hand. Who are all these people? 
SCOTT Jus' ma peeps. And the folks who read my BLOG. 
Zoe rolls her eyes, then notices a WEIRD SWEATY KID, who's throwing mustard covered baloney slices at the ceiling, where they stick with a satisfying SQUISH. 
ZOE Dude, not cool... 
VARIOUS SHOTS - The Plummer House: 
- Its a huge party: the place is JAMMED, kids everywhere. 
- Teenagers come and go through the kitchen's DOGGY DOOR.

Shane (Tyler in Snuggle), loads Brownies into the minivan, counting them. Barking at them like Marines: 
SHANE Move, move, move! Go go! 
EXT. SUBURBAN ROAD - MOMENTS LATER 
Shane drives, the Brownies are singing 99 Bottles... again. Suddenly, a look of horror comes across Shane's face... he spins the minivan in a 180 and floors it. 
INT. CHUCK E. CHEESE - LATER - DUSK 
Shane (Tyler in Snuggle) bursts in, the Brownies follow. We see what he forgot: PETER, still happily playing in the pool of plastic balls. The Manager is watching him. 
MANAGER I figured you'd come back for him -- they almost always do. 
SHANE Inexcusable, to leave a man behind like that... 
MANAGER Relax, we once found a kid in the ball pool when we opened in the morning -- 
Shane wades into the ball pool and pulls Peter out, which is fine, except that he's MISSING HIS DIAPER. 
MANAGER (CONT'D) WHOA, Whoa. Not okay, freestyling in the ball pool -- not okay. 
S 
Shane grimaces. He holds his breath, and goes down for the diaper. He disappears under the balls -- for a long time. The Manager and the Brownies share a concerned look. He's still down there. Silence. 
LULU Should we send someone in after him? 
ZOE You're not my dad! 
Shane stops. Lulu and Todd step into the hall. Zoe gets up, shaky and furious, and screams in Shane's face. 
ZOE (CONT'D) We hate you, you hate us. You're like a robot. Why don't you just leave us alone? 
Silence. Lulu's crying, Todd picks her up. Shane stands, helpless. After a beat... 
SHANE You're right, Red 1. I'm not the man for this job. 
LULU Shane --! 
SHANE In all my years I have never been treated with such disrespect. Not even from the enemy. Don't worry, as soon as your mom comes back, I'm gone. 
Suddenly -- the power goes out. 
SHANE (CONT'D) Now what? 
ZOE (sighs, tired) It's Scott... 
SHANE Puberty... talking doesn't do any good. Go to your rooms. 
Suddenly, TWO NINJAS, all in black BURST in through the window. Shane spins in fight-stance. 
SHANE (CONT'D) (to the kids:) Go! 
Terrified, Zoe and Todd scoop up the kids and rush down the hall. 
The Ninjas pull a retractable KENDO STAFFS. Wielding them with great skill. It takes all of Shane's skill to fend them off -- the three fight, close-quarters and fast. Until Shane pulls down attic's spring-loaded FOLDING LADDER and clocks a Ninja with it. He goes down, but Shane is SHOCKED from behind by the other NINJA. The Ninjas attack, fiercely -- they're good. Their Kendo staffs hiss with a powerful ELECTRIC CURRENT. The Ninjas knock Shane backwards down the stairs... 
NINJA GHOST -- hand it over! 
They leap down after him, pounding him with their staffs, knocking him into...

There are TOYS EVERYWHERE -- like a tornado hit a TOYS-R- US. Shane fends the Ninjas off. He spots a BASEBALL BAT, and grabs it, facing them, fiercely. They step back... 
SHANE Okay -- who wants some? 
Shane swings the bat down on a Ninja's head: It's a whiffle bat, it makes a silly thunk. Shane and the Ninja share a surprised look -- then the Ninjas charge. Shane fends them off with his Whiffle bat. With his foot, he picks up a FISHER PRICE CORN-POPPER, and uses them both to fend off blows. It rattles and pops as he fights with both Toys -- until a Ninja breaks them with one blow. Shane sees a FARMER JOHN TALKING GAME. He jumps up onto a shelf and grabs it. He pulls the string, and swings the plastic disk like a deadly bolo. 
FARMER JOHN GAME The rooster goes... 
WHACK, he hits a Ninja in the head. He swings the Farmer John like a bull whip -- until a Ninja knocks the shelf over. Shane crashes down, toys fly, several FURBIES hit the floor. They echo the fight: 
FURBIES Ow! Ow! 
Shane sees: The Ninjas are wearing only Ninja socks -- no shoes. He grabs a barrel of LEGOS, and flings them all over the floor. The Ninjas move towards him -- the Legos and Jacks dig into their feet. 
NINJA/FURBIES Ow! Ow ow! Crap! 
The Ninjas fight as they hobble around, avoiding Legos, Shane runs to the changing table, then violently squeezes DESITIN at a NINJA, blinding him. 
Shane hangs in the doorway and swings at them, KICKING a Ninja in the chest. The Ninja CRASHES through the window! 
he other Ninja looks up, fearful. Suddenly he grabs a bottle of BABY POWDER. He sprays it in Shane's face... POOF! The room fills with a CLOUD OF WHITE. 
ANGLE - SHANE 
He squints, blinded. The cloud dissipates... and Shane sees he's now alone. He runs to the broken window. 
OUTSIDE: 
The Ninja's are long gone. Shane bangs the window sill, disappointed to have lost them. 
INT. HALLWAY - SECONDS LATER 
Composing himself, Shane approaches Zoe's door.     He quietly knocks. 
SHANE Kids.   It's safe. You can open up. 
A long pause -- then the door creaks open. The kids run out and hug Shane with all their strength, bawling. Todd and Zoe enter, terrified. Shane isn't sure what to do... Then, he hugs Peter and Lulu. He really hugs them. 
LULU Please don't leave us Shane. 
SHANE I'm not going anywhere. 
He hugs them, even Zoe is crying and hugging Shane. 
ZOE I'm sorry for giving you a hard time. 
SHANE Shhh... It's okay. 
MURNEY That? Lady drivers, what do you expect. No, it's not that -- it's the boy... 
SHANE Red two? I mean Todd? 
Claire nods. Shane gives Zoe a look. Zoe shrugs. 
PRINCIPAL CLAIRE Ordinarily I would wait for his mother to return... but -- I'm a bit concerned, and I'm not sure what to do... 
SHANE Has he been skipping class? 
PRINCIPAL CLAIRE Well -- yes. He does always miss sixth period. But this... 
Murney calls into the hallway. Todd enters. Shane stops, in shock: Todd's long hair is all shaved off, he now has a bleach blonde BUZZ CUT, giving him a "skinhead" look. 
MURNEY This is how he showed up to practice. And that's not all. I was doing a little re- con in his locker... and I found this: 
Murney hands Shane a book and Shane flips through it. It's a book of photographs of NAZI UNIFORMS. Shane scowls. 
MURNEY (CONT'D) If he'd had Hustler or something, boys will be boys -- but this is just sick. 
SHANE He's not a NAZI. 
PRINCIPAL CLAIRE It's certainly not normal. (pulls Shane aside.) See if you can talk to the boy.   Find out what's going on. 
Shane shakes his head: Todd is worse than he thought. Todd and Zoe stand to go, and Shane walks them out. 
The WRESTLING TEAM is assembled, stretching. They snicker and shake their heads at Todd, as he passes. Shane walks the kids out, and Murney chases after him. 
MURNEY hope you won't go light on him -- that whole family's no good, if you ask me. 
SHANE I'll talk to him. 
MURNEY You're a good man, Shane. Bet you're a hell of a fighter on the mats, huh? (Shane ignores him, and keeps walking.) Maybe sometime we oughta strap up, we'll give these boys a treat. 
He "fake-punches" one of his Boys -- who flinches like Murney has maybe hurt him a couple times. Murney laughs. 
SHANE Another time, maybe... 
MURNEY It's a date then. I'll show you a couple moves. I promise I won't hurt you. 
Shane walks away. Without warning, Murney lets out a Kung Fu SCREAM, and leaps at Shane, kicking him in the BACK, Shane trips forwards to his knees. Murney tells his team: 
MURNEY (CONT'D) See that? You never know when your adversary is going to strike! 
SHANE Did you kick me in the back? Is there a footprint on my jacket? 
Shane dusts off his back, and leaves. 
MURNEY Come on Frogman! Don't be a sissy! 
Shane turns back. It looks like Shane might fight, but instead he takes a deep breath, and leaves. Murney shakes his head, and snickers to his Team. 
EXT. PLUMMER HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER 
The minivan pulls up, with Shane and all the Plummers piled in. Shane parks, Todd runs towards the house. Shane holds Todd back by the arm. 
SHANE Wait Todd, I want to talk to you... 
odd yanks his arm away and runs into the house. 
INT. TODD'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Shane knocks on Todd's door. Nothing. He enters. The window is wide open, Shane checks his window alarm -- there's a REFRIGERATOR MAGNET stuck to it, keeping the contact, so the alarm didn't go off. 
SHANE Smart kid. 
Shane looks out the window -- far down the block, he can see Todd, running around the corner. Shane hops out the window. He sees Zoe, peering out her window. 
SHANE (CONT'D) Zoe, you're in charge. If anyone gets within forty clicks of the perimeter, signal me. Keep all doors sealed, do your homework, preheat the oven, and make sure Lulu brushes her teeth! 
He starts to shut the window, but the Duck leaps up on the sill. 
SHANE (CONT'D) You want in or out? 
The Duck leaps out. Shane screws the window shut. On the corner, Shane sees Todd climbing on to a CITY BUS. 
Shane picks a GIRL'S BICYCLE up off the front lawn. It's pink, with a flowered basket. It's small for him, but he hops on and pedals furiously after the bus. 
EXT. CITY STREET NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER 
Shane, on the girl-bike, pedals after the bus. A few HOMEBOYS watch him pass, curiously. He nods back, tough. 
EXT. OLD WAREHOUSE - DOWNTOWN D.C. - NIGHT - LATER 
There's some mumbling. Liesl chimes in. 
LIESL We don't have a director... 
Shane shakes his head. 
SHANE No director? I have directed rescue missions in Afghanistan! I've directed numerous snatch and grabs in countries who's names you are not allowed to know. I have choreographed multi-pronged amphibious landings and stealth air attacks! (full of bravado) Do you think I have the stomach to whip this production into shape, or not? 
Everyone nods... Todd looks up at Shane. He smiles. 
TODD Yes. 
SHANE YES WHAT? 
TODD/CAST YESSIR. 
INT. PLUMMER HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - LATER 
Shane's patrolling the hallway. He hears Zoe in her room, BREAKING something, angrily. He peeks in -- just as Zoe THROWS her cell-phone into the wall, furious. 
SHANE ... What's up? 
ZOE (embarrassed) Nothing... It's stupid... Scott. I called him in his room, another girl picked up the phone. I know it's no big deal. I don't know why I let it get to me. 
SHANE I don't see what you see in this guy. 
ZOE It's just nice to think someone's thinking about you, you know? S SHANE (He nods) It won't happen again. 
ZOE ... No wait! ...What are you gonna do? You're not gonna hurt him are you? Promise you won't touch him. 
SHANE Okay. I promise. I won't touch him. 
Shane exits. He turns out the light. 
INT. LULU'S ROOM - LATER 
Shane tucks Lulu into bed. 
ULU Tell me a story. 
Shane looks at her surprised. He sits on the bed... Stumped. Then he starts: 
SHANE Okay. Let's see. Once there was a family of Elves. (MORE) 
T 
S 
L 
SHANE(CONT'D) One day, the little Elf family -- Uh. Went into the magic forest. To find a secret gnome... facility, where gnomes where turning mushrooms into... Uranium. The elves had to go in and take it out. 
ULU Why? 
SHANE They were ordered to. By the Elf Unit commander at Elf station bravo. So -- they waited for cloud cover, and they came in from the north... 
As Shane finishes the story, he illustrates, setting up the scene with DOLLS, on Lulu's floor. 
SHANE (CONT'D) The Elf Team decided on an L Ambush -- so three elves formed a base leg and laid down a heavy suppressive fire on the gnomes while the others maneuvered around to the right flank and walked through finishing off anything left alive... I mean standing...                    D ISSOLVE TO: 
AN HOUR LATER: 
Shane's really into the story. Lulu's fallen asleep. Shane's eyes are brimming with tears as he finishes: 
SHANE (CONT'D) ... And not one Elf got left behind that day. We got `em all. Even, the teeniest little elf of all -- Rodriquez. 
Then, from across the hall, Peter WAILS.   Todd pops his head in the door. 
ODD You have to do the Panda Dance... or he won't stop. 
SHANE Oh, c'mon... I can't remember that thing. 
TODD I'll write it down for you... 
The wails get louder and LOUDER... 
S 
INT. NURSERY - CONTINUOUS 
Tyler's asleep. Shane sighs, and whispers to Peter, reading from Todd's notes: 
SHANE When you're down and low, lower than the floor. And you ain't got a chance. Don't make a move `til you're in the groove, and do the Panda Dance... 
she only clips one, it teeters, but doesn't fall. Shane gives her a signal, she throws it in reverse and drives the course backwards. 
EXT. PLUMMER HOUSE - FRONT LAWN - DAY 
Lulu, in   her BROWNIE uniform, ties a complicated knot -- we WIDEN   to see she's tying Shane's hands behind his back, as   the Brownie troop watches. He counts "1,2,3..." and then   begins wriggling free. They watch closely. 
EXT. MALL PARKING LOT - DAY 
Shane and Zoe are huddled under the minivan's dashboard. Shane's showing her the IGNITION WIRES. 
EXT. PLUMMER HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY 
Shane has the Brownies assembled. He's attached SOFA CUSHIONS to himself. The Brownies attack, mercilessly. 
INT. NURSERY - DAY 
Shane changes Tyler's diaper RAPID-SPEED.    Hands a blur. 
INT. OLD FACTORY - NIGHT 
Todd and "Liesl" work on the You Are Sixteen dance. 
ODD ... your life little girl, is an empty page/that men will want to write on... T odd tries the spinning kick, but blows it, landing hard. Shane blows a WHISTLE. 
SHANE Why don't we just let the Nazis win tonight -- huh? Now. From the top -- think of yourself as a gazelle prancing over the plains. Graceful. 
Todd tries the kick. THUD!    Shane BLOWS the whistle. 
SHANE (CONT'D) Gazelle.   Prancing. Graceful.   Again. 
INT. NURSERY - NIGHT 
At the end of Peter's crib, Shane performs the "Panda Dance." Singing and doing all the moves -- he's got it down, adding a James Brown flourish, now and then. 
U 
SHANE Don't touch that dial sleep for a while -- HEAAAY! And say good night, Peter Panda. 
He does a spin kick. Then he tucks Peter in. 
SHANE (CONT'D) Good night, Peter. 
PETER (going to sleep) Good night, daddy. 
Shane is so touched, he almost bursts into tears. He kisses Peter on the forehead. 
SHANE I'm not your daddy, Peter. But sweet dreams. 
MONTAGE ENDS 
EXT. "PRICE CLUB" STORE - EVENING 
The Brownies sit at their cookie table beside the door. Across the lot, the Chubby Cub Scouts, at their own table, see them. The Scouts head towards the Brownies. U GLY CUB SCOUT Hey Skeever, what's in a Girl Scout's pants when she has diarrhea? 
2ND SCOUT Brown... 
He stops short, the Brownies have moved into a FORMATION, ready to strike, Lulu at the front: it's (kind of) scary. 
LULU Go away and we won't hurt you. 
The Scouts share a look -- they LAUGH. The head Scout steps forward and grabs Lulu's cookies. In one move, she spins out of the way and pulls off his neckerchief. 
GLY CUB SCOUT Gimme that! 
He grabs the neckerchief, but like lightning, she wraps it around his arm, tying him. She shoves a cookie in his mouth. 
LULU Uh oh. You're gonna have to pay for that. 
The Scout struggles, the Other Scouts are scared. 
UGLY CUB SCOUT Let go! Let go -- MOMMY! 
She lets him go -- in a FLIP, he lands on the ground hard. Lulu lets out another "kia!" The Girls move forward in unison, striking a cool pose. 
INT. "PRICE CLUB" STORE - CONTINUOUS 
Shane shops, wearing the double snuggle. As he's comparing prices -- he sees, on the security monitor: The Brownies attacking the Cub Scouts. He smiles, proud. S SHANE That's my troop. 
EXT. "PRICE CLUB" STORE - A MOMENT LATER 
The Cub Scouts have all been tied with their own bandanas to the CART CORRAL. Shane comes out of the store, and catches Lulu, using his "catchphrase." 
LULU From now on, you do things our way -- no highway option! 
J INT. HOTEL - CONTINUOUS 
ulie's on the other end. 
JULIE The red tape is cleared up, we're on the first plane in the morning. 
INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER 
Zoe runs down the hall, telling the family: 
ZOE Mommy's coming home! Mommy's coming home! 
Everyone wakes up, happy, sleepy! 
TODD When? 
ZOE Tomorrow morning! 
PETER Mama! 
Excited, the kids are all abuzz, talking excitedly. 
ANGLE - SHANE 
He's left alone. 
EXT. BACK YARD - LATE NIGHT 
The house is dark. Shane sits in a lawn chair, scoping the area with NIGHT VISION GOGGLES ON. Gary sits in the next chair. Shane sighs morosely. 
SHANE Just another assignment. No reason for personal attachments. 
Shane takes a sip out of a juice box. He pets the Duck. 
SHANE (CONT'D) Hey Gary, your wings aren't clipped. How come you don't fly away? (pause) (MORE)

SHANE(CONT'D) I guess you've got it good.    Kids to play with. Three squares a day. 
he Duck stares, unblinking. 
SHANE (CONT'D) All quiet on the western front. I guess I better fix that Playroom window. S hane rises. 
INT. GARAGE - NIGHT 
hane turns the light on. Gary follows Shane as he looks for tool. Suddenly, the Duck starts quacking... Shane turns. Gary's foot is caught in a grate. 
SHANE What happened, Gary? 
Shane gets down on his hands and knees and gently pries Gary's foot from the grate. Shane is about to stand when something below catches his eye. 
Shane pulls out a pen flashlight, shines it down the grate... we see a CRANK WHEEL. 
SHANE (CONT'D) What do you suppose this is? 
Shane tugs at the grate until it pops off. Shane grips the valve and tries turning it. Nothing. He tries harder, muscles rippling, and then it gives... The wheel spins. 
he floor opens, revealing a CIRCULAR STAIRCASE, leading below the garage. Shane steps down it... 
INT. BOTTOM OF STAIRS - CONTINUOUS 
There's a small room, and a hall leading to a STEEL DOOR. It's solid and inscrutable. No hinges or cracks. The only break in its surface is a strange, TWO-PRONGED KEYHOLE. Shane looks on stunned... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. GARAGE - MORNING 
Shane's at the Steel Door. He has high-tech tools laid out in front of him. He's been trying, unsuccessfully, to crack the lock all night. The Kids are watching his progress, Lulu hands him a tool. Shane dials a phone. 
INTERCUT: 
B 
S 
Shane leads Bill inside. Bill holds the pronged key. 
ILL I'm really proud of you, Shane. I'm giving you your choice of assignment, anywhere you want. You just name it. 
SHANE That's kind of you, Sir... pause) But I'll have to think about it. 
Bill stops, surprised.   Shane continues, a bit reluctant. 
SHANE (CONT'D) Sir, all I've never known is the military. At nine years old my father put me in cadet school and from there I never looked back. Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't trade it for anything and I have no regrets... 
S 
S 
BILL I should hope not. 
SHANE But being with these kids has made me feel like there's more to life than taking out your enemy. And I think I want to explore that some more. 
Suddenly, an ANGRY VOICE. 
MAN'S VOICE PUT YOUR HANDS UP!! 
WIDE 
Shane and Bill spin, startled.    The CHUNS strides up, GUNS DRAWN. 
MRS. CHUN Give US THE KEY! 
SHANE Mr. and Mrs. Chun?     They checked out- 
KOREAN MAN H ands up! 
Compliant, Shane puts his hands behind his head. He takes a submissive position... Mrs. Chun comes closer, reaching for Bill's key... Shane shoots Bill a glance... 
SHANE NOW! 
Shane SPINS and grabs both guns! He WHACKS the Koreans' forearms, while SLAMMING their heads together. 
hane takes control! He smiles, relishing a second of glory -- when suddenly, CRACK! A third gun BUTTS him in the head. 
CLOSE-UP - SHANE 
Lights out. He turns, startled, and starts to fall. Disoriented, confused, he looks up as he drops... 
SHANE'S POV 
He is losing consciousness. Things are spinning... woozy. 
B 
KOREAN MAN (arguing with Bill) You promised us GHOST months ago! 
BILL I'm sorry, Mr. Chun. There were delays... 
Shane peers in confusion, then passes out. 
FADE TO BLACK. 
FADE IN: 
INT. NURSERY - MOMENTS LATER 
Julie and the Kids are on the floor, tied up. Peter and Tyler are caged in the play pen. Peter has a JUICE BOX. The Korean Man (Mr. Chun) secures the room, closing the window shades. Bill checks the knots binding the children. They whimper, scared. L ULU SHANE!! 
BILL He won't be baby-sitting you anymore. 
He GAGS the kids.    Julie glares, livid. 
JULIE I trusted you. Charles trusted you. So did the Department of Defense. 
ILL North Korea pays better. (to Mr. Chun) Keep an eye on them. You -- with me. 
Bill GAGS Julie. The Kids are furious. Bill and Mrs. Chun exit. 
INT. GARAGE - DAY 
Shane lies unconscious. Bill and Mrs. Chun approach the steel door. Bill inserts the two-pronged key... and it CLICKS. The door HUMS, then slides OPEN! 
Inside is a dark corridor.      Bill grins.   They enter... 
INT. SECRET VAULT 
Light is at the end.    They anxiously tiptoe, reaching... 
JULIE AGGGH! 
She SCREAMS. Bill lurches into view, clutching her! The kids are horrified. They start to run back, but she urgently gestures -- 
JULIE (CONT'D) Keep going!     RUN! Go GET HELP!!! 
The kids fret, unsure, then nod and run to the side garage. Zoe and Todd load the kids into the minivan. 
ZOE/TODD Hurry!   C'mon! Buckle up!! 
INT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
Bill pulls Julie inside. Mrs. Chun listens to Mr. Chun ON THE RADIO, speaking in Korean:

INT. VAN - CONTINUOUS 
Zoe floors it. 
OE Omigod!   What are we doing??! 
TODD Let's look for a cop!

The sedan GUNS its engine, gaining on them. 
oe runs a yellow. She hits the curb and goes AIRBORNE. WHOOOOOO! The kids SCREAM, as they sail through the intersection! The sedan keeps chasing. 
INT. GARAGE - SAME TIME 
Bill has Julie at gunpoint, leading her to the secret door. They step past Shane's body, lying on the concrete. 
BILL How does it work? 
JULIE How does what work? 
BILL Don't play dumb. It's getting old. I want to know how to get through the booby traps. What's the code? 
JULIE I don't know any code -- Charles didn't tell me about the room... 
BILL If I knew Charles had hidden it so well, I wouldn't have killed him so soon. Don't make me kill you too. 
Julie GASPS, chilled. Then, a CRACKLING of static.    Mrs. Chun exits the vault, holding a military RADIO. 
B 
MRS. CHUN Mr. Bill, my husband has question: 
MR. CHUN (OVER THE WALKIE) I have a clean shot at their tires. It's B risky, they might wreck... 
ILL ... Do it. 
JULIE NO! 
Julie goes frantic, emotional. 
SHANE (O.S.) Bill, don't hurt the kids. 
Surprised, everyone looks down. 
ANGLE - SHANE 
They look over -- Shane is standing in the doorway. 
Shane LAUGHS sharply. That's the code! He shares a look with Julie. Bill and Julie share a look -- they have no idea what he's laughing about. 
Calmness comes to Shane's face. He takes a deep breath, S facing forwards: 
SHANE (CONT'D) Just hop three times like a kangaroo -- 
He hops forwards three times, fearlessly. NOTHING HAPPENS. No BOOBY TRAPS are set off. 
SHANE (CONT'D) Sidestep twice, just like the crabs do. 
He steps sideway, across two tiles. Again -- NOTHING HAPPENS. It dawns on Julie what he's doing. Julie smiles, relieved. Shane he steps forwards, then back: 
SHANE (CONT'D) Three steps forward and one step back. 
When he steps back -- A SPRING-LOADED SPIKE launches down from the ceiling, imbedding itself where he was standing. Shane is rattled, his focus gone. Until Julie shouts: 
JULIE QUICK LIKE A TURTLE LIE ON YOUR BACK! 
Shane snaps out of it and flops down on his back -- just in time: FLAMES SHOOT FROM BOTH WALLS right at him. If he'd been standing, he'd be toast. 
EXT. BUSY INTERSECTION - SIMULTANEOUS 
The Minivan blasts through another yellow. 
LULU Look out Zoe! Rollers! 
There is a POLICE CAR cruising the street ahead of them. Zoe blows past it. Inside is the Cute Cop. The Squad Car's lights flash on, and he catches up with the minivan -- it takes a while, they're FLYING. 
ZOE Come on. Use the gas, not the brake, 5-0. 
Zoe slows down so the Police Car can pull up beside her. The Cute Cop shouts over at Zoe. 
CUTE COP I'd say you could lose your license -- but you haven't got one! 
ZOE People are trying to kill us. They have my mom, and our bodyguard -- you have to follow me! 
CUTE COP Just pull over! 
ZOE Fine. Don't follow me! 
She swerves into the Squad Car, almost running it off the road. Zoe U-turns, and speeds back towards her house. The Squad Car turns around and chases her. 
EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MOMENTS LATER 
The Minivan speeds by. The Squad Car is on its tail. It is joined by MORE SQUAD CARS. Following the chase, at a safe distance, is Mr. Chun in his now-wrecked sedan. 
EXT. SCHOOL - SAME TIME 
Murney and Claire are watching a SOCCER GAME.   He's in a NECK-BRACE. 
MURNEY That Baloney Bandit struck again. I accept full responsibility. My intelligence proved to be faulty, but if I had more resources... 
She shakes her head, Suddenly, the Minivan SPEEDS by. VROOOOM! Then the Police Car CHASES by. VROOOM!! Then -- FIVE MORE POLICE CARS ZOOM BY. VROOOOOOM!!! 
MURNEY (CONT'D) (not that surprised:) I told you not to pass her in Driver's Ed. 
Claire frowns, concerned... 
INT. PLUMMER BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS 
Shane is on the floor, sliding forward, nervously. 
SHANE Wriggle like a snake `til you can't no more. Then better jump quick, like there ain't no floor. 
Shane jumps up just AS THE FLOOR UNDER HIM DROPS AWAY, revealing a pool of liquid. Shane has wedged himself in the corner. A bead of his sweat falls into the liquid, and sizzles in a cloud of smoke. It's acid. 
SHANE (CONT'D) (to himself, to calm down) Almost done, almost done... "Just hold your breath, and jump to the left." 
He jumps, to the left of the HOLE. He lands in front of THE SAFE. He's relieved -- then nozzles spray YELLOW GAS at him. He holds his breath just in time. Still holding his breath: 
SHANE (CONT'D) And that's the Peter Panda Dance. 
He flips the switch to DISARMED. The safe's red light turns green. Immediately, the flamethrowers and blowguns retract! The gas gets sucked into grates. The whole room goes SILENT. Whew. 
Bill looks around. He nervously steps forward - he waves his hand over the floor, and jumps back. Nothing happens. 
Bill signals for Mrs. Chun to go first. She gestures back: you go. It's a stand-off. Finally, Bill takes a breath -- and walks across the room. The Booby Traps are disarmed. Mrs. Chun follows, pulling Julie along. 
BILL Thank you, Shane. You were always my best man. I knew you'd figure it out. 
Shane scowls, disgusted. 
BILL (CONT'D) You know, if you're willing to join up, I'd be happy to cut you in on the proceeds. What do you say -- we make a good team? 
Inside, the cavernous metal box holds but one object: A tiny COMPUTER CHIP. Shane gently removes it. 
SHANE ... GHOST. 
They look in silence. She smiles at Shane, grateful. 
JULIE Thank you Shane. It's finally over. Now we can go back to our peaceful... 
Then -- a sudden AMPLIFIED VOICE from behind them: 
ULLHORN (V.O.) FREEZE! HOLD IT RIGHT THERE! 
EXT. HOUSE - SAME TIME 
Total commotion. The kids clamber from the van, with their hands raised. Cops surround them. Even Peter and Tyler have their little hands over their heads.   The garage door raises, Shane steps out. 
SHANE Whoa, WHOA!    What are you doing to these kids?? 
CUTE COP FREEZE. HANDS WHERE I CAN SEE THEM. 
Cops cover Shane and Julie, Julie and Shane Freeze. 
ZOE But, officer... 
CUTE COP I said FREEZE. Zoe, you're in a lot of trouble... Reckless endangerment! Driving without a license. Numerous, uh... trafficS violations -- 
SHANE (cutting him off) These kids are heroes. They just aided in exposing a high-level espionage ring. I suggest you call the FBI. Now. 
Silence. The Cops are unsure what to do. He scoffs. 
CUTE COP You expect me to believe any of that? 
Suddenly -- a CRAZED SCREAM. 
MR. CHUN (O.S.) EVERYBODY!   HIT THE GROUND!!! 
WIDE 
Everyone spins. Mr. Chun stands inside the gate, pointing a ROCKET LAUNCHER. He's disheveled and manic. 
MR. CHUN (CONT'D) I WANT THE GHOST, TEN MILLION DOLLARS, AND A DIRECT FLIGHT TO PYONGYANG! 
The cops freeze, helpless. Shane weighs his not so many options... Nobody is sure what to do. 
But then -- a WOMAN suddenly flips over the fence, vaults onto Chun, and KNOCKS him out with a Karate Chop. 
PRINCIPAL CLAIRE Ya!! 
Claire lands on her feet, triumphant. Even Chun is amazed, as he turns his head, Shane spins, and grabs the rocket launcher. 
CLOSE-UP - SHANE 
He breaks into a big grin. 
CLOSE-UP - CLAIRE 
She proudly smiles back at him. 
ANGLE - THE CUTE COP 
He's flummoxed. This chaos is unsolvable.    Beaten, he reaches for his radio. 
COP I think I'll call the FBI. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. PLUMMER HOUSE - LATER 
F.B.I. AGENTS swarm the area. Bill and the Chuns are being hauled away in cuffs. Julie huddles with the kids. Shane talks with an F.B.I. Agent. F .B.I. AGENT Mr. Wolfe... that was nice work.   You're a one-man battalion. 
SHANE Just doing my job. 
F.B.I. AGENT The Bureau is always looking for good men. Do you have a card or something? 
The Agent hands him a BUSINESS CARD, then walks off. Shane examines it, swelling with pride. 
INT. GARAGE - CONTINUOUS 
The Kids are looking around, watching the FBI Agents work. Lulu is following one of the FBI Agents around. 
LULU Do you have to wear that thing in your ear all the time? 
FBI AGENT Yes.

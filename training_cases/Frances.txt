FRANCES

PROLOGUE 
BLACK. We HEAR the soft voice of Frances Farmer. 
FRANCES (V.O.) No one ever came up to me and said, 'You're a fool. There isn't such a thing as God. Somebody's been stuffing you.' 
FADE IN: 
EXT. PUGET SOUND - DAY 
On an expanse of water, calm and undisturbed. After a moment, it begins to ripple as something rises toward the surface. A girl's face breaks through. 
FRANCES (V.O.) It wasn't a murder. I think God just died of old age. And when I realized He wasn't any more, it didn't shock me. It seemed natural and right. 
The girl, FRANCES, is 16, blond, very pretty: she seems like the most persuasive proof imaginable of God's existence. She swims toward the shore with long graceful strokes... then climbs the steps of the old wood jetty on West Point Beach. 
FRANCES (V.O.) And yet I began to wonder what the minister meant when he said, 'God, the Father, sees even the smallest sparrow fall. He watches over all his children.' That jumbled it all up for me. 
EXT. PUGET SOUND - LATER 
The banks of Puget Sound, dotted with elm trees. Frances sits comfortably in the fork of a tree writing in her diary. Towel around her neck, her hair splayed out and drying golden in the sun. 
FRANCES (V.O.) But still sometimes I found that God was useful to remember, especially when I lost things that were important. 'Please God, let me find my red hat with the blue trimmings.' 
INT. FARMER HOME - FAMILY ROOM - EVENING 
Frances is now reading aloud from her diary, gently swaying back and forth in a rocking chair. An older woman, LILLIAN FARMER, sits opposite on the couch, listening and nodding from time to time. A small suitcase stands by the front door. 
FRANCES It usually worked. God became a superfather that couldn't spank me. But if I wanted a thing badly enough, He arranged it. 
ERNEST FARMER appears in the doorway and hesitates, listening to his daughter read. 
FRANCES But if God loved all of His children equally, why did He bother about my red hat and let other people lose their fathers and mothers for always? 
Ernest goes to Frances and kisses her softly on the top of her head. She looks at him briefly, smiling slightly. 
ERNEST Bye, baby. 
FRANCES See you next weekend, Dad. 
He goes to the door and picks up his suitcase, glances at Lillian. She doesn't look up. He leaves. 
FRANCES I began to see that He didn't have much to do about hats or people dying or anything. They happened whether He wanted them to or not, and He stayed in Heaven and pretended not to notice. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY 
Frances stands at a podium. Other STUDENTS and TEACHERS sit to either side of her on folding chairs. Above the proscenium is engraved: West Seattle High School. Below that a banner hangs: "NATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL ESSAY COMPETITION, 1931." 
FRANCES I wondered a little why God was such a useless thing. It seemed a waste of time to have Him. After that He became less and less, until He was... nothingness. 
The AUDIENCE consists of parents, students, and local dignitaries. We SEE several shocked faces. Lillian is there also, smiling. Seated next to her is a distinguished-looking woman, ALMA STYLES. Ernest sits on the other side of the auditorium, looking a little worried. 
FRANCES I felt rather proud that I had found the truth myself, without help from anyone. It puzzled me that other people hadn't found out, too. God was gone. We had reached past Him. Why couldn't they see it? It still puzzles me. 
Frances closes her notebook and looks up, waiting for some response. There is a deep shocked silence, then a smattering of applause. Lillian claps enthusiastically, then rises to her feet. In the back a WOMAN also stands. 
WOMAN You're going straight to hell, Frances Farmer! 
A stately man sitting next to her, her husband JUDGE BENJAMIN HILLIER, puts a restraining hand on her arm. The woman continues to glare at Frances. 
Frances stares back, dumbfounded. 
SMASH CUT TO: 
EXT. SEATTLE STREETS - DAY 
The screen erupts into violence. A large unruly MOB skirmishes with POLICE in a cobblestoned square. On a truckbed addressing the crowd -- which carries placards reading: "Organize Now!", "Workers of the World Unite!", and "Elect Kaminski!" stands MARTONI KAMINSKI. By his side, leading the crowd's responses, stands a younger man with sharp piercing eyes, HARRY YORK. 
KAMINSKI And do you think it's radical for a man to have a job and feed a family? 
YORK & CROWD No! 
KAMINSKI Is it radical for you to have a hand in shaping your future, and the future of your children? 
YORK & CROWD No! 
KAMINSKI Is it radical for the wealth of this country to be turned back to the people who built the country? 
YORK & CROWD No! No! 
KAMINSKI Good! Because, Brothers, that's you! 
The crowd cheers. Harry York gives Kaminski the thumbs-up sign as a banner unfurls: "Today Seattle -- Tomorrow the World." 
FADE TO BLACK: 
FADE IN: 
FRANCES Well... I'll give it a try, Mr. York. 
HARRY Harry. 
FRANCES (hesitates, nods) Harry. 
They half-smile, awkwardly, as if neither really wants this encounter to end. Then Harry doffs his hat. 
HARRY Bye. 
She nods shyly and starts up the path toward the house. 
HARRY (admiring her) Sure don't walk like sixteen, neither. 
INT. COURTROOM - LATE AFTERNOON 
CLOSE ON Judge Hillier in his robes, identified by a nameplate on the bench. 
HILLIER These are perilous times. With the economic collapse comes hopelessness and desperation; and people turn to dangerous ideas -- 
WOMAN'S VOICE I know. 
The CAMERA PULLS SLOWLY BACK. We SEE that the courtroom is empty. 
HILLIER Those of us who represent law and order must be vigilant. Who's behind this, her mother? 
Now we SEE who he's talking to: Alma Styles, the woman who sat with Lillian at the school auditorium. 
STYLES Impossible. As her attorney, I've known her for years. 
HILLIER What about the father, he's a little pink. Maybe he wants to show our schools in a bad light, shift some support to Kaminski and those jackals. 
STYLES (shaking her head) He's no influence; he doesn't even live at home. No, I think Frances wrote that essay with no mischief intended. It was her teacher who entered it in the competition. 
HILLIER Well, the publicity must stop. It's no good for Seattle and no good for the country. (sternly) Keep an eye on this, will you, Alma? 
STYLES Of course, your honor. 
He nods with satisfaction. Two right-thinking people fighting for what they believe in. 
INT. FARMER HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT 
Ernest Farmer sits alone, motionless, at the table. Between two candles, facing him, is Frances' check for a hundred dollars. 
We HEAR bustle from behind the kitchen door, then Lillian and Frances enter juggling several hot dishes. Ernest rises. They set down the dishes, Frances intentionally placing the bread between the check and her father. 
ERNEST It always amazes me, Lil, how you can whip up a hot, hearty meal out of thin air. 
LILLIAN I can thank you for that. It was a hard-earned talent. 
She moves the bread so Ernest again faces the check. As Lillian slices the bread, father and daughter eat grimly. 
LILLIAN (offering to Ernest) Bread? 
ERNEST (taking a piece) Thank you. 
LILLIAN When's the last time you saw a hundred dollars, Ernest Farmer? 
FRANCES Mama... 
LILLIAN (pushing back her plate) I'm not hungry. You two just enjoy yourselves. After all, this is a celebration. 
She leaves. A long silence. 
They both glance slightly awkwardly at the check. 
Frances takes it, folds it, and puts it in her pocket, out of sight. 
ERNEST I'm... I'm really proud of you, Frances. 
FRANCES Thanks, Dad. 
ERNEST An essay contest... a national contest. That's pretty impressive. 
FRANCES I didn't have much to do with it. 
ERNEST You wrote it, didn't you? 
FRANCES Yeah, I suppose... Dad, who's Harry York? 
ERNEST Well, Harry York is a guy who... well, he does a lot of things. Why do you ask? 
FRANCES He talked to me today. Told me to keep my mouth shut or I'd get everybody in trouble. 
ERNEST Yeah... well... it's possible. Harry York and I both work for Mr. Kaminski right now, and... well... There are lots of folks in this country who never got a square break. That's the way of things, but Mr. Kaminski wants to change it, and when it comes to new ideas, the people in power get nervous. 
FRANCES Is Kaminski a Communist? 
ERNEST No, no, no. All he wants to do is see the common man get a little representation. 
FRANCES He's a socialist, then? 
INT. STUDY - LILLIAN - NIGHT 
Sitting at a rolltop desk. She's looking through a large scrapbook. We SEE articles about nutrition and diet, some featuring Lillian's picture, others with her name in the heading. She listens to the conversation in the other room. 
FRANCES And then we shall rest, we shall rest. We shall hear the angels, we shall see the whole sky all diamonds, we shall see how all earthly evil, all our sufferings, are drowned in the mercy that will fill the whole world. And our life will grow peaceful, tender, sweet as a caress... (wipes away tears) Poor, dear Uncle Vanya, you are crying... (through her tears) In your life you haven't known what joy was; but wait, Uncle Vanya, wait... We shall rest... (embraces him) We shall rest! 
Curtains close. AUDIENCE bursts into applause. 
As the curtain opens and the players take their bows, we SEE in the audience: Lillian and Ernest, Lillian clapping madly, crying, nudging Ernest to clap harder. 
And in the back stands Harry York. 
HARRY (to himself) Not bad, Farmer. Not half bad. 
INT. UNIVERSITY READING ROOM - NIGHT 
A celebration in progress. Masks of Comedy and Tragedy hang on the walls. DRAMA STUDENTS lounge about: eating, drinking, talking noisily. Bing Crosby is on the record player, singing "I've Got The World on a String." The Drama Teacher is holding court to a group of attentive students. 
DRAMA TEACHER Art is a constant struggle. Some of you have the will but not the ability. For others, the opposite. I don't wish to be harsh, but only one of you on stage tonight combined the two... 
The front door opens. Frances and Chet enter. 
DRAMA TEACHER On cue. 
The young men rush over to congratulate her. Frances takes a mock bow. She laughs as people cheer. TWO GIRLS observe from the back. 
GIRL #1 I could really learn to hate her. 
GIRL #2 Stand in line. 
INT. UNIVERSITY READING ROOM - SEVERAL HOURS LATER 
Things have quieted down. The Drama Teacher has cornered Frances and is gesticulating drunkenly, waving a copy of "Voice of Action." Frances is also tipsy, but pays close attention to her mentor. 
DRAMA TEACHER This is the answer: a subscription drive to "Voice of Action!" First prize is a trip to Moscow! You could visit the art theatre, maybe even meet Stanislavski! 
FRANCES But I'll never win that. 
DRAMA TEACHER Yes, yes, it's all arranged. Everyone's collecting subscriptions in your name. And the best part is: the trip returns you to New York. 
FRANCES (intrigued) Really? 
DRAMA TEACHER New York, Frances! Broadway! This is your chance! You belong on the stage! 
FRANCES (flattered/embarrassed) Thank you. 
A door opens quietly and Harry slips in. He smiles at Frances, who disentangles herself from her teacher and rushes over. 
FRANCES Hi, Harry. Did you see the play? 
HARRY You think I'd miss it? 
FRANCES Well? What'd you think? 
HARRY (shrugs) I just wanted to see how you looked. 
FRANCES How'd I look? 
HARRY (teasing) Enh. 
FRANCES (smiling) Don't be a rat, Harry. 
HARRY You looked okay. (glances around) Joint's pretty dead. How 'bout I take you home? 
She hesitates, looks around and sees Chet passed out, snoring in a chair. She takes Harry's arm. 
EXT. WEST POINT BEACH - NIGHT 
The beach is very dark, but the sweep of the lighthouse picks up an old Chevrolet parked near the shore. 
FRANCES (V.O.) You really think so? 
INT. CHEVROLET - NIGHT 
Frances and Harry are sitting in the back seat. 
HARRY Honest. When you were up there, you were really... there, know what I mean? Everyone else looked stupid. 
FRANCES I don't know... I did... feel different... Alive. 
HARRY Yeah, it's a gift. You gotta do something with it. 
FRANCES Yeah, but if I win this trip, Mama'll kill me. She hates Russians. I do want to go, though... to New York, especially... but I wanted to do it... 
HARRY What? 
FRANCES Quietly. 
HARRY You're not the quiet type, Frances. 
They are silent for a while. 
HARRY You know, my old man was an inventor. Spent his whole life down in the basement trying to design transcontinental underground railroads, stuff like that. Well, I was supposed to be his partner. When I told him the smell of his workshop made me sick, I thought he was going to die right there. 
FRANCES What happened to him? 
HARRY He retired to Florida... made a killing in vending machines. 
He grins ironically and Frances laughs. 
DICK Dwayne. Dwayne Steele. 
ERNEST What...? Oh. Well, I was pleased, of course. Richard... uh, Dwayne, is a real gentleman. 
Dick smiles and hugs them both. 
DICK Well, all I can say is: I feel like I've known these two for years! 
LILLIAN (girlishly) Oh, Dwayne! (overcome) This is like a fairy tale! 
They're stopped at a light. Outside their window we SEE DERELICTS, casualties of the depression, huddled in the night. 
INT. FRANCES' LIMO - NIGHT 
She's staring at the derelicts. We feel her sympathy for them. Almost like she'd rather be out there. A MAN WITH HOLLOW EYES shouts something at them. 
FRANCES What'd he say? 
She rolls down her window. The Studio Executive beside her looks at her like she's crazy. 
STUDIO EXECUTIVE (to Driver) Let's go. We'll be late. 
The limousine lurches forward. Frances settles back in her seat, letting the night air sweep over her face. 
EXT. THEATRE - NIGHT 
The two limos pull up, the second emptying first. As Frances gets out, the CROWD cheers wildly. She walks past them, eyes glazed. She doesn't see Harry, who is held back by cordons. Lillian is posing and signing autographs. In her tight, formal dress, Frances looks radiant but constricted. As she walks, voices assault her: 
LILLIAN There she is! 
REPORTER #1 (O.S.) How does it feel to be back in Seattle, Frances? 
FRANCES A little strange. 
WOMEN'S VOICES Isn't she gorgeous? 
STUDIO EXECUTIVE (O.S.) This way. 
REPORTER #2 (O.S.) How's the movie, Frances? 
FRANCES It's okay. 
LILLIAN (O.S.) Smile, little sister, smile. 
Frances sees her mother smiling nervously. They have entered the: 
INT. LOBBY - NIGHT 
Again there is a cordoned area in the center where Seattle luminaries are sipping champagne. Reporter #1 lurches forward: 
REPORTER #1 Can you make some statement about Seattle, how the city helped you, or the schools -- 
FRANCES Well, the truth is the city had nothing to do with it. I was lucky. And what wasn't luck was hard work. 
REPORTER #1 (disappointed) Oh. 
Judge Hillier's Wife, whom we recognize as the Woman who shouted at Frances in the auditorium, steps forward in a garish gown. She's holding a large key. 
JUDGE HILLIER'S WIFE Miss Farmer, I can't tell you how proud I am to meet you. 
She embraces and kisses Frances, who's more than a little put off. After the kiss, she takes firm hold of Frances' hand and won't let go. Judge Hillier steps to his wife's side. Lillian also approaches. 
JUDGE HILLIER'S WIFE On behalf of the Seattle Ladies Club, as a token of our vast admiration -- 
FRANCES Excuse me. 
JUDGE HILLIER'S WIFE (startled) Yes...? 
FRANCES Don't I know you? 
JUDGE HILLIER'S WIFE I don't believe so. 
FRANCES Sure. You shouted at me in the auditorium when I read my essay. 
JUDGE HILLIER'S WIFE No, my dear. You must be mistaken. 
FRANCES (barely audible) Oh bullshit. 
JUDGE HILLIER I beg your pardon? 
FRANCES (to the dignitaries) Listen, I'm still the same girl that wrote that essay, the same girl who went to Russia, and you people aren't proud to meet me at all. 
A hideous silence. Judge Hillier is fuming. His wife is aghast, the key to the city extended awkwardly in front of her. She shoves it into Frances' arms. 
Frances moves to leave, but her arm is taken by the Studio Executive, who escorts her into the theatre. The crowd follows. Lillian is utterly mortified. 
EXT. THEATRE - NIGHT 
We TRACK along the side of the theatre. An exit door is thrown open, and Frances storms out. As she does, she trips over an OLD INDIAN BEGGAR. She stops and looks at him. He peers up at her with large forlorn eyes... then holds out his hand. A connection is made. All the anger drains out of her. She gives him money, several bills. He breaks into a wonderful crooked grin. She starts away, hesitates, then hands him the key to the city. He stares at it, bewildered. 
She strides away toward her limousine, which is now parked with several others at the end of the alley. The CHAUFFEURS are talking and smoking a cigarette. Her chauffeur sees her and hurries to his limo. As it pulls into the street, we see Harry drift back to the curb and stare after it. 
OMITTED 
EXT. WEST POINT BEACH - NIGHT 
CLAIRE Hi Frances, got a minute? 
FRANCES Sure, Claire. If you don't mind walking my way. 
They walk toward the dressing room. 
CLAIRE (nervous) Well, I suppose I should just say it. It's your clothes. 
FRANCES (bewildered) My clothes? 
CLAIRE Yeah, I mean slacks... and work clothes... and that awful car -- 
FRANCES It's a perfectly good car. It runs. 
CLAIRE Yes, but... Really, I hate to sound... it's just that the public expects something different from its stars. People won't take you seriously. 
FRANCES I don't care if my clothes are taken seriously. Or my car. 
CLAIRE You know what I mean. 
FRANCES Uh-huh. You mean what if the public finds out I perspire? And wear slacks. And drive an old jalopy? What if they find out I'm a real person. Oh no! Say it ain't so! Not a real person! 
Claire is laughing. They go inside. 
INT. FRANCES' DRESSING ROOM - DAY 
Posh, fit for a star. Frances smiles at the MAKEUP MAN. 
FRANCES Morning, Eddie. 
As Frances sits at the table and Eddie goes to work: 
CLAIRE That's not all, Frances. Mr. Bebe is very concerned about your politics. He hears you've been donating money, speaking at rallies. 
FRANCES Yup. Claire... please, please tell Mr. Bebe that if he worried half as much about his scripts as he does about my private life, we'd make a lot better movies. 
CLAIRE I'm sorry, Frances. It's my job, you know? 
FRANCES I know. (imitating Bebe) 'This is a factory and we each have our jobs. The writer writes, the director directs, and the actress...' 
CLAIRE (laughing) ...acts. I'll relay your message. 
INT. FRANCES AND DICK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT 
Dick is talking on the phone in the living room. 
DICK Yes, of course she'll make a statement on women's rights. Call back tomorrow, okay? 
He hangs up. Immediately the phone rings again. He stares at it wearily, then answers: 
DICK (pointedly) Dwayne Steele's residence. 
Through the half-open door to the bedroom we see Frances dozing, an open script laid out beside her. 
DICK Yes. (confused) What...? (hurt) Yes. Yes, I'll tell her. 
He hangs up. Stares off. Slowly enters the bedroom. 
Frances looks up. 
DICK You learn your lines? 
FRANCES (nods drowsily) Sort of. 
DICK There've been some calls. 
FRANCES Who? 
DICK Well... about half an hour ago that woman from the talent department called, what's her name? 
FRANCES Claire? 
DICK Yeah, Claire. She said she was fired. Too bad, huh? 
FRANCES (apprehensively) Fired? 
DICK Yeah. She said she delivered your message and that you'd understand. 
Frances looks stricken. 
Dick presses on. 
DICK There was another call too. From your agent. He says your summer stock deal is all set. So you're going back east, huh? 
FRANCES ...Yes. 
DICK Without me. 
FRANCES (sighing) Showdown. 
DICK You weren't going to tell me, were you? Just pack up and leave, is that it? 
FRANCES Dick, we need some time apart -- 
DICK Hey, I'm not a complete fool, you know. I can see you're going sour on me, and when I try to do something about it, you turn your back and say it's nothing. 
ODETS That's who my play is about. 
Frances watches the girl. 
FRANCES That's me, Clifford. 
ODETS (strong) I know, but I'm not seeing it. It's there, Frances, the fire is there, but it's not coming through. You're lazy -- 
INT. WORKING CLASS BAR - LATER 
The same conversation continuing: 
FRANCES I'm not! 
ODETS Yes, you win them, you bring them into your heart, touch them, but you don't set them on fire! 
FRANCES But I want to. I'm trying! 
ODETS I need an incendiary! An arsonist! 
FRANCES Then show me! That's what I'm here for, to learn, to grow! 
ODETS Good. Then it's very simple. You have to stop being afraid, Frances. It's in you. 
EXT. PLATFORM - SPANISH EMBASSY - DAY 
Clurman is delivering a speech in the background as PHOTOGRAPHERS snap pictures. Behind them on the platform Frances and Odets continue their conversation in whispers: 
ODETS I can see it. You just have to let it out. Trust it. No one will quash you here, but it's still a fight, a struggle! Being true to your art, being honest, is always a struggle! 
We now HEAR Clurman's speech. The initial words below were background to the above. What we HEAR now is underlined: 
CLURMAN ...Not only an artist, but an instrument of change. We must look to the world around us, not content to observe, but to take an active hand in redressing its wrongs. We will not stand idly by as Fascist bombs obliterate democracy. We contribute our profits, for if fascism is not stopped in Spain, it will spread across Europe, jeopardizing the struggle of civilized man to survive. (presenting check to SPANISH CONSUL) The artist, to be vital, must be a soldier too. 
FRANCES I'm not afraid of struggle, Clifford. 
CLIFFORD Yes you are. We all are. The first step is to acknowledge our fear. 
EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREETS - NIGHT 
They're walking. The conversation continues. 
CLIFFORD Face it! Confess it! You're weak! 
FRANCES I'm not! 
CLIFFORD You're afraid! 
FRANCES I'm not! 
CLIFFORD You don't want to show your whole soul -- ugly, mis-shapen, and pitiful -- you don't want to show it -- 
FRANCES (angry) God damn it, Clifford, will you shut up! I tell you, I want to give these things! I want to give them to the audience, and I can give them, I will give them, so shut up! 
She is seething. Gorgeous. Alive. 
He smiles, watching her. 
CLIFFORD Good, good. Give them that. 
FRANCES What? 
As she feels the anger coursing through her body she realizes what he's talking about. She looks at him, still breathing heavily. Gradually her face turns toward a smile. 
He reaches out and, with exquisite tenderness, kisses her. 
INT. ODETS' APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Later. They enter slightly drunk, laughing. He takes her coat. 
CLIFFORD Madam...? 
FRANCES Thank you. 
She's looking at the apartment. He sees her. A dark thought flickers across his face, and he breaks into an exaggerated act: 
CLIFFORD Oh my God! Frances, I'm such a cad. I can't go through with this. My wife is in Europe, but this is her house... (gesturing off) her bedroom. I can't ask you to... 
FRANCES (playing along) Oh well. I guess I better leave then. 
She starts to put on her coat. He watches her. 
CLIFFORD Okay, but come here first. 
FRANCES Huh. 
CLIFFORD (Leading her down hall) Come here. I want to show you something. 
He opens the bedroom door. 
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT 
The bed is drawn back, and the sheets are sprinkled with rose petals. 
Frances' eyes are large. 
YOUNG MAN Is it true you're getting a divorce? Comrade? 
FRANCES Why, you... you little bastard! 
The Young Man grins. 
YOUNG MAN Thanks for our chat, Miss Farmer. Be seeing you. 
He begins to walk away. 
FRANCES Just one minute... 
YOUNG MAN (turning) You're wasting your time, lady. Nothing's off the record with me. 
He is gone. 
OMITTED 
INT. WORKING CLASS BAR - NIGHT 
Odets sits at a table in back, drinking and writing in a notebook. Frances comes up to him. 
He smiles, draws her to him for a hug. 
ODETS How'd it go? 
She hesitates, still affected by the incident outside the theatre. 
FRANCES 'But how do I know you love me?' 
ODETS Your big speech? 
FRANCES 'How do I know it's true? You'll get to be the champ. They'll all want you, all the girls! But I don't care. I've been undersea a long time. When they'd put their hands on me I used to say, "This isn't it! This isn't what I mean!" It's been a mysterious world for me! But Joe, I think you're it! I don't know why, I think you're it. Take me home with you.' 
ODETS (smiling) I already have. 
She nods, turns her back to him. 
FRANCES How's it sound? 
ODETS The speech? Real good. 
FRANCES You think I got it? 
ODETS You got it. 
FRANCES Yeah. Yeah, tonight I think I got it. 
She is crying. 
OMITTED 
INT. ODETS' APARTMENT - DAY 
Frances comes in the front door with a bag of groceries, removes her key. Walks into the living room, stops short. Clurman is sitting on the couch, a bottle and two glasses in front of him. 
FRANCES Hello, Harold. 
CLURMAN (nodding) Frances. 
FRANCES (looking around) Where's Clifford? 
CLURMAN He's not here. 
FRANCES Oh. 
She sits. 
CLURMAN Bourbon? 
He pours. She drinks hers, watching him. 
FRANCES What's up? 
CLURMAN I hear you're meeting with the studio lawyers to get out of your contract. 
FRANCES That's right. I don't want them breathing down my neck while we're in London. 
CLURMAN Well... well, you see, that's the point. You won't be opening in London. 
Frances looks like she's been punched in the stomach. 
FRANCES (insecure) You don't think I'm good enough? 
CLURMAN What?! Good Lord no, it's just... It's money. We needed backing and... well, we found it. 
FRANCES Who? 
CLURMAN An actress. 
FRANCES A rich actress. 
CLURMAN Yes. That's the deal. She plays Lorna. 
FRANCES (growing angry) But... but wait a minute. We're supposed to be different, right? Clifford says... This theatre is supposed to be different! And this play... this play is all about what greed and money do to people! 
Sitting comfortably in a nearby director's chair is a DIRECTOR reading Daily Variety. The headline reads: "STUDIO WINS FARMER WAR ON HOLLYWOOD." Behind the Director, off to one side, stands Bebe. The A.D. tugs on the Director's sleeve: 
A.D. How was that? 
DIRECTOR (looking up) Good, good. One more time. 
FRANCES (standing) For God's sake... why? 
DIRECTOR Because we want to get it perfect... just the right combination of fury and confusion. You can understand that, can't you, Miss Farmer? We're serious artists here, right? Right. 
The Director glances toward Bebe, who nods with satisfaction. 
Frances watches this interaction. She hesitates, then approaches Bebe. She wipes some mud from her face and drops it at her feet. 
FRANCES Look, Mr. Bebe, you can hold me to my contract, but you can't break me. I'm back, and I'm gonna make the best of it. 
BEBE (somewhat snidely) I'd like nothing better. 
She turns and walks, with an air of pride, to her wardrobe trailer. 
EXT. ELEGANT BEACHFRONT HOME - NIGHT 
Lights everywhere. Cars line the driveway. We HEAR the SOUND of a large party. 
A car pulls up. BOB BARNES gets out, goes around to open the door for Frances. She's exhausted. She doesn't move. 
BARNES Well... come on. 
FRANCES This is a mistake. No. This is a disaster. 
BARNES Come on, it's just what you need! Let everyone see you. Talk to them, live it up! 
FRANCES (tiredly) But we've been at it since six this morning. At least you could've let me go home and change. 
BARNES Look, Frances, I didn't want this job. Think I'm crazy? But you begged me: improve your image. So please... lemme try, huh? 
FRANCES (getting out) You're right. I'm sorry. (sighs) Okay, let's go get 'em. 
BARNES (taking pills from pocket) Here, take a few of these. Studio makes 'em in the basement. They keep the fat off. 
FRANCES (joking) So not only am I a troublesome bitch, but I'm fat too? 
BARNES Come on. They make you feel nice and peppy. 
She nods, takes a few. They head for the door. 
INT. HOUSE - ENTRY HALL - NIGHT 
The DOORBELL CHIMES. The hostess, CONNIE, a pleasant-looking woman, answers the door. 
BARNES Hi! Bob Barnes! Looks like a swell party! 
CONNIE (pleased) Frances! 
As they embrace, Frances looks around with trepidation: 
FRANCES (whisper) God, who's here? 
CONNIE (also whispering) The usual vermin, I'm afraid. 
Barnes tries to pull Frances inside. 
She sees a flurry of waiting faces. Everyone's watching her. 
FRANCES (sotto voice) Get me a drink. 
Barnes nods, concerned, and crosses to the bar. 
FRANCES Hi everybody. 
Some people seem amused, some curious, some scornful. The Director from the mud scene nods to her. Connie is at her side for support. A voice from somewhere pierces the chatter: 
SNIDE VOICE So nice to have you back, Frances. 
As Barnes returns with her drink, she turns to Connie: 
FRANCES Connie, can I use the upstairs bathroom? 
CONNIE Sure. 
INT. UPSTAIRS BATHROOM - NIGHT 
Later. Frances lies in a bubblebath, relaxing, sipping her drink. She obviously feels a lot better. Someone knocks. 
FRANCES Come in. 
A FAT MAN ENTERS, stares at her. 
FRANCES (relaxed) Hi. 
He is dumbfounded. He slowly retreats into the hall. 
INT. DOWNSTAIRS LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Barnes is talking to a Young Man whom we recognize as the reporter who tricked Frances in New York. 
TORA It's about time! You're not the star on this show, y'know! 
Frances sits. Tora begins brushing her hair, yanking Frances' head back with each stroke. Building tension... 
TORA Of course, it's not up to me to say anything. I'm just crew... Y'know, you hair's so fine you'll lose it if you're not careful. Wonder you all don't, the things you do to yourselves. In fact, I think you are already... Fact, I think you better -- 
Frances cries out and twists around suddenly. Tora is thrown back: stumbling... falling... hitting her jaw against a chair. 
FRANCES That's it! I'm not taking this any more! I quit! 
She storms out. Tora is left moaning, holding her jaw. 
INT. STAGE - MOVIE SET - DAY 
Frances marches across it. Everyone stares. 
FRANCES Goodbye!... goodbye!... goodbye!... 
When she reaches the exit door, she turns and bows to them all, grandiloquently. 
INT. FRANCES' HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 
She's snoring in bed. Face down, spread-eagled. The light is on. A whiskey bottle (three-quarters empty), a tumbler (three- quarters full), and a bottle of pills sit on the night table. 
The phone RINGS. She winces, groans, tries to open her eyes then squeezes them together: hung over. Her arm flails out, finds the light and turns it off. 
FRANCES Shit. 
The phone keeps RINGING. Her arm gropes for it. 
A loud POUNDING at the door. 
FRANCES What the hell's going on here? (calls) Hold on! (answering phone) Hello... (we HEAR a dial tone) Hello? 
The POUNDING at the door becomes violent. Someone's breaking it down. 
FRANCES Hey! 
The door splinters. 
FRANCES What...? Help! 
Men stream into the room. Back-lit from the hall they look like monsters, phantoms. They're carrying sticks. 
Frances screams and runs naked into the bathroom. 
FRANCES Don't kill me! Don't kill me! 
She slams the door on the advancing figures. 
INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT 
Frances leans her weight against the door. 
FRANCES Mama, help me, help me, Mama! Don't let them kill me! 
It's too much for her. She's shoved back, falling to the floor. The door flies open revealing THREE LARGE COPS. Leering at her. Frances clutches at the shower curtain, trying to cover herself. 
COP Get your clothes on. 
FRANCES (crying) You have no right! You have no fucking right, you bastards! Get the hell out of here -- 
COP Get your clothes on, lady -- 
FRANCES GET OUT! 
COP You're under arrest.

INT. SANTA MONICA POLICE STATION - NIGHT 
Frances is being led to the booking desk. All around her Photographers snap her picture, and Reporters walk alongside subjecting her to a never-ending barrage of questions. Frances just smokes a cigarette and smiles grimly at the dour-faced SERGEANT facing her. 
SERGEANT Name? 
FRANCES I don't believe this! You jerks drag me down here in the middle of the night and you don't even know who the hell I am! 
The Photographers laugh. 
SERGEANT Age? 
FRANCES Fifteen. 
SERGEANT (bristling) Address? 
FRANCES Just put me down as a avg -- a vagrant vagabond. Come on, this is a joke! Assault and battery? I barely touched that bitch! 
SERGEANT Occupation? 
Frances considers for a moment, then smiles matter-of-factly. 
FRANCES Cocksucker. 
The Sergeant reddens. Frances laughs as the Photographers snap their shots. 
The Matron relaxes her grip and gives Frances a handkerchief. Frances dabs at her eyes... wraps the kerchief around her knuckles... and slugs the Matron in the jaw, sending her sprawling. Frances runs to the phones. 
REPORTER Oh my God, she's loose! 
Frances throws herself at the door of the booth. The Reporter is delirious with joy: what a story! 
REPORTER She's attacking your correspondent! Right here in the Court Building! Good God, this bitch is crazy! Someone stop her! 
Frances pounds at the door a few more times, then moves to the next booth... into the arms of Harry. 
FRANCES (a whisper) Harry! 
Harry shakes his head. Before he can speak, Frances is grabbed from behind and dragged toward the elevator. 
FRANCES I have a right! I have a right! 
REPORTER (into phone) With what must surely be the final act of madness, the curtain falls on Frances Farmer's once promising career. The crazed blonde who at 
Harry opens the door to his booth. The Reporter looks up at him. 
REPORTER Hold it a second, Bub... 
Harry says not a word, but punches the Reporter hard in the face. The Reporter sags, out like a light. In the confusion, no one has noticed a thing. Harry pulls the door shut. 
INT. COURTROOM - DAY 
Frances is sitting in a wooden chair. The venetian blinds over the tall windows are almost completely closed. The room is dim and terribly quiet. A WOMAN is murmuring something to a kindly-looking JUDGE. Another MAN is standing beside her. Frances can't quite make out the words. 
WOMAN ...and we feel that this would be more appropriate. 
JUDGE ...a difficult decision, but, I'm sure, the proper one. 
He nods to the other Man who, together with the Woman, turn away from the bench. As they pass in front of one of the tall windows, Frances recognizes the Woman. It is Alma Styles. 
FRANCES What? 
She feels an arm slip around her shoulders and she stiffens. Her mother's face appears by hers. 
LILLIAN (whispering) It's alright now, little sister, everything's going to be just fine. 
FRANCES Mama, what's... 
LILLIAN Shhh, shhh. You're not going to jail, Frances. The Judge has put you under my care. I'll see you get the rest you need. 
FRANCES You're taking me home! 
Two other WOMEN appear at either side of Frances and Lillian. Lillian tenderly takes her daughter's face in her hands. 
LILLIAN (smiling) First things first, little sister. Trust me. 
She kisses Frances on the forehead. Frances looks at the two Women. They are smiling understandingly at Lillian. Frances looks a little alarmed. 
OMITTED 
EXT. ENTRANCE DRIVE - DAY 
A wood-panelled station wagon turns the corner of a tree- lined road and heads up toward tall wrought-iron gates. On a white-washed wall are black letters: "MEADOW WOOD CONVALESCENT HOME". The Station wagon, a similar sign on its door, pulls up. The gates swing slowly open, and it travels up a long tree-lined driveway. As it goes by, we see Frances sitting in the back seat between Lillian and one of the Women from the previous scene. 
The car heads up toward a large Spanish-style building set back among some trees. 
INT. A SMALL OFFICE - DAY 
Frances sits in front of a desk nervously smoking a cigarette. Lillian stands at a window looking out at a broad expanse of well-manicured lawn ending at a row of oaks in the distance. 
LILLIAN Why it's beautiful here! What a view! 
Lillian smiles enthusiastically at Frances, who stares accusingly back: she's not falling for that. 
An awkward moment of silence. Lillian fidgets, doesn't know what to say. She is rescued when the door opens and DR. SYMINGTON (early 30s, glasses, white coat and ingratiating smile) enters. He holds his right hand out to Frances. 
MAN Good afternoon, Miss Farmer. I'm Dr. Symington. 
Frances stares at the proffered hand. Lillian steps in quickly and takes it. 
LILLIAN Good afternoon, Doctor. 
The Doctor winks at Frances and puts a hand on Lillian's arm. 
SYMINGTON I'm very pleased to meet you, Mrs. Farmer. I'm sure we'll have more of a chance to talk later. Right now I think it's important that your daughter have a chance to settle in. Perhaps it would be best if you said your goodbyes here. 
He smiles pleasantly. Lillian is obviously very put off by the idea. She looks at Frances who stares unseeingly out the window. 
LILLIAN Oh. Well, I have some background that you should probably know about if you're... 
SYMINGTON I have no doubt, Mrs. Farmer. If you'll speak to the girl at the desk, she'll arrange an appointment. 
He goes to the door and opens it. Lillian is momentarily at a loss, but she acquiesces. She bends down and tightly hugs Frances, who pats her on the back a couple of times. 
LILLIAN I'll be back real soon, little sister. You be a good girl. 
She waits for a reply and then, getting none, starts out the door. 
FRANCES (staring out window) Mama! 
Lillian turns back expectantly. 
The Nurse smiles confidentially at her. 
NURSE Honey... take my word for it. This is a resort. 
They get to the door and HEAR Lillian's protesting voice: 
LILLIAN (O.S.) You have no right! 
They enter and SEE the Matron struggling to get Lillian's coat away from her. Lillian pleads with Frances. 
LILLIAN Tell them who I am! Tell them who I am! 
FRANCES Are you crazy? Unhand that woman! That's Amelia Earhart! 
Frances bursts out laughing. The Matron releases Lillian and comes for Frances. 
INT. FRANCES' ROOM - DAY CLOSE-UP OF A HYPODERMIC NEEDLE 
A little fluid squirts out the tip. 
FRANCES (O.S.) But what is it? 
CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL Frances strapped down on a white cot. The Nurse is holding the syringe while a THIN NURSE and an ATTENDANT stand by. 
FRANCES You've got to tell me what it is! 
THIN NURSE It's insulin. It throws your body into shock. 
Frances looks at her suspiciously, uncertain whether to believe this, and turns toward the Nurse with the hypodermic. 
NURSE WITH HYPO (reassuringly) It's just vitamins. 
This sounds more reasonable. Frances relaxes somewhat. 
NURSE WITH HYPO A, C, B-Complex, certain minerals... (inserting hypo) Just stay relaxed... Good, now open your mouth a sec. 
Frances does. The Attendant jams a rubber bar between her teeth. Frances squirms, fights. The Attendant holds the bar in place. And the Nurse pushes the plunger on the hypo. Frances goes rigid. Her eyes widen, her back arches. With a loud hoarse cry she starts to convulse. The SCREEN BEGINS TO FADE into bright white light. She is unconscious. The SCREEN IS NOW BLANK. 
EXT. COURTYARD - MEADOW WOOD - DAY 
Frances sits beside Lillian on a bench. Other patients with ground privileges wander aimlessly about. 
There is an open carpet bag at Lillian's feet and, in her lap, a bundle of letters and telegrams that she's showing to Frances. Frances seems restless. 
LILLIAN ...and here's the one from Duluth. A war widow with five children. She works in a defense plant and she's very worried about you. I answered her that she shouldn't let worry over you affect her vital work; and that you'd be back on the silver screen in no time. 
She hands it to Frances, who lets it drop beside her on the bench. 
LILLIAN And here's one from nice Mr. Zeiss. He says that... 
FRANCES Why are these all opened? 
LILLIAN Well, they needed immediate answers, Frances. It's good manners and good sense. You shouldn't be bothering yourself with these right now. 
FRANCES Then why did you bring them? 
LILLIAN It's your fan mail, little sister. 
FRANCES (looking off, under her breath) You kill me, Mama. 
LILLIAN What? 
FRANCES Go on... 
Frances sighs. She looks for something to divert her attention. 
INT. SYMINGTON'S OFFICE - DAY 
Frances is alone in the room. The door is ajar. She's standing over Symington's desk, which is empty except for a doodle pad. The doodle she's looking at is extremely bizarre, sadistic... After a moment, Symington ENTERS holding several folders. Frances' manner changes very subtly. 
SYMINGTON ...I'm sorry to keep you waiting, the staff review ran over. Did you enjoy your mother's visit? 
FRANCES (sitting) Yes. It was very good to see her. 
SYMINGTON Really? Any problems? 
Symington puts the folders in a drawer. All except Frances'. 
FRANCES Not at all. She brought me my fan mail. (a performance) I had no idea there were so many strangers concerned about me. But I guess that's the best thing about working in the movies. You make so many friends. I want to go back and show them that the faith they put in me wasn't a mistake. 
SYMINGTON You're telling me you feel guilty. 
FRANCES (slightly edgy) No... What I mean is... I'm just very excited by the prospect of getting on with my life, that's all. 
SYMINGTON (after a pause) Do you really believe your mother's trying to kill you? 
FRANCES (laughing) What? 
SYMINGTON She told me you said, "Mama, you want to kill me." 
FRANCES I never said... Oh look. That's just a figure of speech. She said something funny, and I said... 
SYMINGTON And you accused her of tampering with your mail. 
FRANCES Oh for Christ's... 
The Attendants hold their ground. Harry runs after Frances. 
EXT. GROVE OF TREES - DAY 
Frances and Harry crash through bushes, come to a high wall. 
HARRY (offering to lift her) Here. 
Frances hugs him tightly, kisses him. He lifts her by the waist, and she grabs the top of the wall and hauls herself up. Harry joins her. We SEE, over the wall, a Lincoln Zephyr waiting on a dirt road. Harry and Frances jump down as we HEAR the Two Attendants burst through the underbrush and haul themselves up. As their heads pop over the top of the wall, they see the Lincoln disappearing down the road in a cloud of dust... 
INT. LINCOLN - DUSK - DAY 
Harry, eyes bleary and shoulders hunched, tries to concentrate on the road ahead. The RADIO DRONES quietly, a lazy saxophone ballad. After a while, there's movement in the back seat and Frances sits up. She yawns and stretches as Harry watches her in the mirror. 
HARRY Evening, gorgeous. 
FRANCES (yawning) That sure looks like fun... (leaning over front seat) You know how long it's been since I was behind the wheel? 
HARRY Forget it, Frances. You're not driving. 
FRANCES Have I told you how mean you're turning, York? 
Harry smiles. Frances climbs over the seat and starts to fiddle with the radio. 
FRANCES Where are we, mean man? 
HARRY Couple hours from Idaho. We'll cut across to Montana. I've got friends there with a ranch. 
FRANCES I should've known... 
HARRY What? 
FRANCES This is another one of your schemes to get me off alone... 
HARRY That's right. 
FRANCES (smiling) ...Take advantage of me. 
Harry laughs. 
They pass a poster: "BUY WAR BONDS!" Frances stares at it. 
FRANCES I don't think I'd be much good in a war... 
HARRY Whattaya think you're in now? 
FRANCES (sleepily) I don't know. Not a war exactly. It's more a... a misapprehension maybe... 
HARRY Huh? 
FRANCES A misunderstanding, people taking the wrong meaning from things. I wasn't declaring war, Harry. I was just saying my prayers. 
Harry looks at her quizzically. 
HARRY Who to? 
Beat. 
FRANCES Harry, I have to go home. I have to talk to Mama. 
HARRY Frances, you're fulla drugs. You don't know what you're saying. Who do you think put you into Meadow Wood? Your mother thinks you're crazy and she'll keep on thinking it as long as it suits her. 
FRANCES (sitting up) No, she just didn't want me going to jail, that's all. 
HARRY Yeah? She's a shark, Frances. I'm not taking you there, and that's that! 
She rubs his neck and his attitude seems to soften. 
She looks at him fondly, thoughtfully. 
FRANCES You know something, Harry? 
HARRY I guess. 
FRANCES Aside from meanness, you're almost perfect. There's only one other thing wrong with you. 
HARRY What's that? 
FRANCES You can't drink. 
SMASH CUT TO: 
EXT. ROADHOUSE - NIGHT 
The Lincoln is parked beside a few other cars. 
INT. ROADHOUSE - NIGHT 
Frances and Harry sit at a table cluttered with empty glasses. The JUKEBOX PLAYS, a few COUPLES dance. Frances is gulping down a tall Scotch. 
FRANCES (wincing/grinning) Ohhh, that's lousy Scotch! 
HARRY (calling drunkenly) Hey! Another shot for the lady and a double for me! 
FRANCES What a man! 
STYLES Never mind. We won't have to worry about him much longer. 
EXT. LINCOLN - END OF FRANCES' STREET - DAY 
Harry pulls up at a stop sign. He rubs his forehead wearily as a car crosses the intersection. It stops dead in front of him. Another pulls up alongside. Another behind. Harry thinks about this. His hand slides down slowly under the seat. We SEE the handle of his ice pick. Harry turns to smile at the MAN in the next car. The Man flashes an FBI badge, points revolver: 
FBI MAN (smiling) How ya doin', Al? 
HARRY You got the wrong guy. Name's Slocum. 
FBI MAN No, it ain't. And it ain't Harry York, neither. 
HARRY Look, I'm tellin' you... 
The FBI Man pulls the hammer back on the revolver. ANOTHER MAN opens the passenger door. 
FBI MAN I'd give you till ten, Al, but we ain't got the time. 
SMASH CUT TO: 
OMITTED 
INT. JUDGE'S CHAMBERS 
Judge Hillier walking... out of the chamber and down a corridor. His stride is long, his demeanor purposeful. The corridor leads into a courtroom. Harry standing at attention. We hear Hillier climb onto the bench and be introduced by the court official. Harry stares up at the judge. 
HILLIER Alvin Hanson, a.k.a. Ronald Burns, Thomas Slocum, Harry York... Mr. Hanson, this warrant has been outstanding for many years. Normally that circumstance would prompt me toward leniency, but the crime you committed -- inciting to riot -- and the cause you sought to promote -- a worker's rebellion -- are such anathemas to this court that I feel compelled to mete out the full sentence. I only wish it were longer. (slamming gavel) Six months in the state penitentiary. 
INT. FARMER HOUSE - DAY 
Frances sits at the piano playing "You Are My Sunshine". Lillian is lounging on the couch, leafing happily through her scrapbook. 
LILLIAN Frances, play 'Flow Gently Sweet Afton'. 
Frances' brows mesh. 
FRANCES Oh Mama, I'm so... tired of that song. 
LILLIAN Please. I want you to. It would make me so happy. 
Frances sighs and begins to play it. Lillian scrunches down and begins to hum along. 
LILLIAN It's just a flow gently sweet Afton day. Life has been so good to me. Why, I have just about everything one could wish... but I still have so many blank pages in my scrapbook. 
She smiles warmly at Frances. Frances abruptly stops playing. 
FRANCES I think I need a little air. 
LILLIAN What's wrong? 
FRANCES Nothing. I think I'll just go out for awhile. 
LILLIAN Where are you going? 
FRANCES For a walk, Mama. Just a walk. 
She gets up and Lillian rouses herself. 
LILLIAN How long will you be? 
FRANCES Not long. 
Frances goes down the hall for her coat. Lillian follows part way. 
LILLIAN (smiling) I'll have lunch ready by one. 
FRANCES I'll be back. 
LILLIAN At one. Promise? 
FRANCES Sure. 
Frances returns wearing the coat. Lillian half-blocking her path. 
LILLIAN Say you promise. 
FRANCES I promise I'll... I promise, Mama. 
Lillian nods, moves aside. As Frances heads for the door: 
LILLIAN You know, the surest way to lose an appetite, is to drink, little sister. 
FRANCES (exiting) Yes, Mama. 
LILLIAN I don't want you drinking, Frances. 
FRANCES Yes, Mama. 
Lillian enters and re-establishes herself on the couch with a happy smile. She begins to hum "Flow Gently Sweet Afton" 
INT. FLEA-BAG HOTEL LOBBY - DAY 
DERELICTS sleep on broken couches and armchairs. In a corner by a pay phone Ernest Farmer sits at a rickety desk piled high with briefs. Frances sits across from him. They've been talking. 
FRANCES ...So what do you think? 
DR. DOYLE (bored) Yes, yes, Mrs. Farmer -- 
ALMA STYLES Frances has always been a battleground, Lillian. 
DR. DOYLE, a psychiatrist, and the others are seated with Judge Hillier around a table. 
DOYLE The point is: it's your opinion that Frances is getting steadily worse? 
LILLIAN Well... yes. 
Doyle fills in a line on the printed form before him. 
DOYLE And you feel you're unable to control her any longer? 
LILLIAN No... I mean, yes, Doctor. 
Alma holds up Lillian's bruised wrists as evidence. 
DOYLE And the only course open to you is to commit your daughter for a period of time to a mental institution? 
LILLIAN Well, Alma told me that... 
Alma looks coolly at Lillian. 
LILLIAN ...Yes. 
Hillier nods slightly, approvingly, toward Alma. 
DOYLE (closing his folder) I believe that's all I need to know about Miss Farmer. 
HILLIER I think in all future documents she should be referred to as Mrs. R. H. Richardson. 
LILLIAN Her married name? 
HILLIER Yes. It's less recognizable. I'm sure you'd prefer to keep unpleasant publicity to a minimum. 
LILLIAN ...Oh yes. 
HILLIER Now. Can you tell us where we might find Frances? 
INT. DOWNTOWN SEATTLE BAR - NIGHT 
It's late. Frances stands at the bar acting out a joke for a small audience of devoted DRINKERS. 
FRANCES ...Looking for a drink, and the town is deserted, he can't understand it. Finally he finds a bar, goes in -- the place is empty, bartender's closing up. Salesman says, 'Gimme a martini.' Bartender's real nervous, he says, 'No, no, no, I gotta close. Big Otis is coming to town.' 
Behind them is a large window covered by a gauzy curtain. In the street a police car cruises slowly past. 
FRANCES Salesman says, 'I don't care. I gotta have a martini.' So the bartender fixes him a martini real fast, grabs his money, and runs out the back. Salesman sits there sipping his martini,... he's got the bar all to himself... Then he hears it. This big roaring in the street. RRRAAAAAAA!!! (stomping her feet) Gigantic footsteps... coming closer. Stopping. 
We SEE the police car again... It stops out front. 
FRANCES Enormous hands reach in, grab the swinging doors and rip them off their hinges. This huge man stomps in. Picks up a chair and hurls it over the bar, smashing the mirror -- whiskey and glass flying everywhere. 
TWO COPS appear at the window, looking in. 
FRANCES He turns to the salesman: 'What the hell're you doing in here!' Salesman says, 'I'm just drinking a martini.' 'Oh yeah?' the guy says. 'Well you better get outa here! Big Otis is coming to town!' 
Everyone laughs. A long moment of enjoyment. Then Frances turns, looks out the window and sees the cops. 
INT. COURTROOM - DAY 
Hillier behind the bench. Doyle sits at a table with Alma Styles. A COURT RECORDER taps out his notes in an odd, jerky style. (NOTE: This scene is INTERCUT, where appropriate, with shots of FRANCES in a bare room, wearing a strait jacket.) 
DOYLE ...From her history, it's apparent the patient suffers from a paranoid reaction with pronounced egotism. Her violent responses have recently included aggression against her mother. In view of the deep-seated nature of her ailments and her failure to respond satisfactorily to insulin shock, it is my opinion she may ultimately require permanent institutional care. 
HILLIER (to Styles) Counsellor, as Guardian ad litem for Mrs. Richardson, do you waive jury trial? 
STYLES Yes, your Honor. 
She signs a paper which is passed to Hillier. 
HILLIER Having heard the testimony of a legally qualified and reputable physician... and being further satisfied of the truth of all matters set forth in the certificates of said physician, I do hereby order that the said Mrs. R. H. Richardson, an insane person, be confined to the Western State Hospital for the Insane at Steilacoom. 
He bangs his gavel. 
HILLIER So ordered! Are the gentlemen from Steilacoom present? 
EXT. STEILACOOM - DAY 
Huge, dark-red brick buildings with barred windows, loom out of the fog and trees. A van pulls up to the front entrance. Two MEN get out, open the back doors and assist Frances out. She is strapped into a strait-jacket. She yells and struggles violently but a piercing SCREAM stops her. She looks up at the building. 
From a top floor window, a thin, white hand protrudes from the bars and waves "hello". 
INT. STEILACOOM HALLWAY - DAY 
Frances is dragged kicking and screaming down the shiny linoleum-covered hallway. There are many patients here, talking to imaginary birds, laughing at unheard jokes. A few of them notice Frances, most do not. The two Orderlies arrive at a door and throw it open. A bare 6'×10' room is revealed with a narrow cot and no windows. Frances is pushed inside and the door locks shut with a resounding click. 
INT. TREATMENT ROOM - DAY 
A MEDICAL STUDENT wheels a small electrical machine up to a table. On the table Frances is securely strapped down. TWO DOCTORS grease Frances' temples and put two metal electrodes on them. The electrodes are connected to the machine. 
DOCTOR #1 What's she getting, anyway? 
DOCTOR #2 Standard series to start. 
HARRY Frances, it's me, Harry? 
FRANCES ...Touch me again and I'll kill you, you pig. 
DOCTOR Watch out, Harry. Let me look her over. 
Harry is on the verge of tears. 
HARRY Oh, God! Let's get her out of here tonight, right now! Let's take her with us! 
DOCTOR The hearing's tomorrow. If she gets out legally, they can't come after her. 
HARRY Look at her! She'll never pass that sanity test tomorrow... 
DOCTOR I'm taking care of that, Harry. Just hold her. (pulling a hypodermic from his pocket) Reserpine. I guarantee you this'll clear her head. She'll wake up feeling smart and sailright through the hearing. 
Harry holds her around the shoulders and straightens out her arm. Frances starts to struggle and moan loudly. 
DOCTOR Yeah... she knows about these. Shut her up. 
Harry glares at the Doctor, but puts a hand over her mouth and the Doctor injects her. Her arm is covered with sores. 
HARRY (tenderly) You'll be okay, honey. He's just givin' you something to make you think, so that tomorrow you can tell 'em what they want to hear, okay? Tell 'em you were crazy as a loon and they cured you and you're grateful. 
The Doctor withdraws the hypo and massages her arm. 
DOCTOR This stuff takes pretty quick. Let's go. 
FRANCES (grabbing Harry) Please! Take me! 
Other women in the ward cry out: "Take me! Take me!!" 
DOCTOR (pulling Harry) Let's get out of here! I'll lose my job! 
HARRY Frances, we gotta do it this way. Just remember tomorrow, remember what I told you. What're you gonna tell 'em? 
FRANCES (groggily) I'm grateful... grateful. 
WOMEN IN WARD I'm grateful! I'm grateful! 
DOCTOR (very worried) Harry! 
HARRY I gotta go now. 
FRANCES Harry, please! 
INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT 
The two Men come out and the Doctor quickly locks the door. 
DOCTOR We're all square now, Harry. Right? 
HARRY All square, Doc. 
DOCTOR Good. 'Cause I don't want to see you again. 
Frances' face appears at the tiny barred window. We can just hear her: 
FRANCES I love you, Harry. I love you. 
HARRY I love you too, Frances. 
Behind Frances we HEAR the Women screaming: "I love you, Harry!" The Doctor takes Harry's arm and pulls him down the corridor. 
INT. WARD - NIGHT 
Frances turns to face the women in their cots. Collects herself. Looks repentant. She is practicing tomorrow's speech. 
FRANCES I realize now that I was a very sick woman. 
WOMEN IN WARD Sick! She's sick! 
FRANCES I couldn't relate to others in a normal way. 
ONE PATIENT (playful warning) She's... not... normal...! 
The others laugh. We realize that if Frances can handle this, she can sail through it tomorrow. The catcalls gradually diminish as she concludes her speech. 
FRANCES And I was not taking responsibility for my actions. But now, thanks to your treatment, I feel ready to face myself, ready to resume the career which I so single-handedly shattered. I only hope... I hope I can make you all proud of me. Thank you. Thank you so much. 
The room is silent now. A very odd moment. To their astonishment, the other patients seem to believe her... 
EXT. FARMER HOUSE - SUNNY DAY 
The vegetable garden is overgrown, the paint peeling. The house is in disrepair, but we can tell from the freshly-mowed lawn that some effort has recently been made... 
A car pulls up. Frances kisses Ernest on the cheek and gets out. As he drives off, she walks into the yard and looks around, heaves a sigh; she's home. Then Christmas lights spring on over the porch. Lillian comes out grinning broadly, followed by REPORTERS. Frances blanches. 
INT. FARMER HOUSE - DAY 
Frances sits on the couch next to Lillian. They're sipping tea and answering questions. Frances is uncomfortable. 
LILLIAN Of course, she hasn't anything definite in mind. 
FRANCES No. No, it all depends on what offers I get. 
She glances across at the Hitchhiker and nods casually. He responds in kind. A relaxed silence follows. Two strangers passing. His voice, when he speaks, is gentle, calm: 
HITCHHIKER Pretty morning. 
FRANCES (nods) It's always beautiful at this time. Peaceful... 
HITCHHIKER And no people. 
FRANCES Yes. 
Beat. 
HITCHHIKER Where you goin'? 
FRANCES Wherever they're going, I'm going. 
HITCHHIKER Yeah, I know what that's like... Where you been? 
FRANCES Well, I was picking fruit with some migrant workers until... 
She stops. She sees now that the car heading toward her is a cop car. She averts her face... then tries to hide her gesture. 
HITCHHIKER What's the matter? 
Frances sighs as the cop car speeds away. 
HITCHHIKER They're looking for you, huh? 
She's uncertain whether to trust him. Takes the plunge: 
FRANCES Yeah. 
HITCHHIKER What'd you do? 
FRANCES You know, I've never been able to figure that out. 
He laughs. She shivers slightly, pulls her clothes around her. He takes out a small flask and offers, no strings: 
HITCHHIKER I've got a little whiskey here, warm you up. 
She smiles, truly grateful: 
FRANCES Thank you. 
Then she sees a ball of dust nearing... a car on his side. 
FRANCES Wait. Maybe they'll pick you up. 
The car stops. Its lights flashing. COPS jump out. 
FRANCES Shit! 
HITCHHIKER Run! 
She does. She's pursued. The Hitchhiker makes an effort to impede the Cops' progress, but is tossed aside. The Cops are slowly, inevitably, gaining on her. 
EXT. SMALL TOWN JAIL - DAY 
Frances and Ernest walk out the door followed by a portly SHERIFF. He watches them get in Ernest's car and drive off. His expression says very clearly: I'm glad that's over with. 
INT. CAR - DAY 
Ernest's at the wheel, Frances at his side. Silence, then: 
FRANCES Dad...? Why don't you stop at a side road and let me out? 
Ernest writhes slightly with discomfort. 
ERNEST Francie, you know I can't do that. 
FRANCES Why? It's such a simple thing. You just let me out and I disappear down a road and you never have to see me again. 
ERNEST They'll just catch you again, Francie. Besides, your mother will know. 
We SEE them approaching a side road. 
FRANCES Dad, here! You don't have to stop, just slow down. You can tell Mama I jumped out. She knows that's the kind of thing I'd do. She won't blame you. 
ERNEST But I gave her my word. Besides, she's still your legal guardian. My hands are tied. 
They are nearer the side road. 
FRANCES You know where you're taking me. You know what she'll do. Just give me a minute, slow down, give me an instant for once in your life, please? 
ERNEST Please, Francie... 
FRANCES (pleading) Daddy! 
They pass the side road. It disappears behind them. All the life seems to drain from Frances. 
ERNEST I'll try to protect you, Francie. I will, I'll talk to her. We'll have a real talk. 
Frances buries her face in her hands. 
ERNEST Are you... are you hungry? 
She is wheeled into a row... between two other patients. In the background we HEAR a voice: 
DR. HARLINGTON (O.S.) One merely inserts the leucotome beneath the eyelid and presses up into the prefrontal lobe, manipulating it so as to sever the nervous connections between the thalamofrontal radiation and the body of the brain. 
The lights are bright, on her and the other patients. We cannot see, but we sense, an audience watching. 
DR. HARLINGTON (O.S.) Because of the speed and simplicity of the operation, I am able, as you are seeing, to perform the procedure on ten patients in less than a half hour. 
Frances stares up at a fan in the ceiling. It's moving round and round. The voice drones on. 
DR. HARLINGTON (O.S.) The operation is completely painless and can be performed without any sedative whatsoever. 
We now see vaguely that DR. HARLINGTON has moved to the patient on the adjacent gurney. 
DR. HARLINGTON We have always known that this form of radical treatment was effective, but until now it couldn't be applied on a large scale. The old procedure required a full day's work by a surgical team to perform a single operation. In the same time, working alone, I can treat fifty. 
Frances turns and stares mutely, without emotion, at what's happening next to her: the leucotome (an ice-pick-like instrument) is inserted into a woman's eye socket... 
DR. HARLINGTON This procedure works best on patients with extreme over-reactions to emotional stimuli. It can also be used as a last resort on those who seem impervious to other forms of treatment. 
The leucotome is then shoved up into the brain and twisted. 
DR. HARLINGTON In plain language, my technique severs the nerves which give emotional energy to ideas. Along with the cure comes a loss of affect... a kind of emotional flattening... 
Frances turns away and stares at the fan again. There is something simple and pleasing about its rhythmic whirring... 
DR. HARLINGTON ...with diminished creativity and imagination. Patients become like good solid cake with no icing. But, after all, it is their emotions and imaginations that are disturbed. 
We glimpse the leucotome being withdrawn. 
DR. HARLINGTON These patients will soon be leaving the hospital. 
Harlington's face moves vaguely into Frances' view. 
DR. HARLINGTON Lobotomy gets 'em home. 
He moves directly over Frances, his pleasant face obscuring the fan. As the leucotome descends, we: 
CUT TO: 
EXT. FARMER HOUSE - DAY 
Total disrepair: peeling paint, broken steps, fallen shingles... This house is easing slowly back to nature... 
INT. FARMER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Neglect is just as evident inside. Dust, faded rugs, torn yellow curtains. Lillian sits on the couch staring out a window. She has aged and looks tiny, frail, with no trace of her old formidability. The scrapbook is open on her lap. 
LILLIAN What was I saying? Oh yes, it was the Communists that did it to Frances. 
Ernest is hunched in a chair by the stone fireplace. FOUR REPORTERS crouch on the floor, totally bored. Yesterday's headlines are now old news. 
LILLIAN They capture the mind by first seducing the heart. I suppose I never taught Frances to close her heart... 
Two Reporters rise and edge toward the door. 
REPORTER Uh... excuse us, Mrs. Farmer. We're going to have to... uh... 
THIRD REPORTER (rising) Yeah, I better pack it in too. 
LILLIAN (distractedly) Pardon? Oh, would you like more lemonade? 
The last Reporter gets to his feet. 
FOURTH REPORTER (kindly) I think we've had enough. Thank you, Mrs. Farmer. Goodbye. 
He follows the others out. Lillian climbs wearily to her feet and goes to the window, looks out. Ernest stares into the fire. 
LILLIAN You know, Ernie, I think we should have Frances' room repainted for when she comes home. That'll brighten her day. 
Ernest looks at her wearily, as if she is stark raving mad. He knows damn well Frances isn't coming home... 
FADE IN ON: A TELEVISION SCREEN against a dark background The show is "This Is Your Life". We SEE a smiling RALPH EDWARDS, reading from a large black book. Next to him stands Frances. She has aged dramatically, but is still a very handsome woman. She seems uncomfortable. 
EDWARDS ...Dwayne Steele divorced you, and from this point on, your story takes a darker turn. Shunned by the Hollywood you criticized so harshly, alienated from your family and friends, you turn your back on professional commitments in New York, and alcohol and drugs enter your life. These are sad, desperate times for you. 
Throughout this, Frances' jaw works slowly back and forth, not from anger, but in embarrassment and doubt. 
EDWARDS ...until finally your mother finds it necessary to commit you to a state mental institution. Were you mentally ill, Frances? 
FRANCES ...No, Ralph. I don't believe I ever was sick. But when you're treated like a patient long enough, you're apt to act like one... 
We MOVE AWAY from the screen to see that the TV set is in the living room of a comfortable, tastefully furnished home. On the couch in front of the set sits Harry York. He still looks athletic, young for his age. Tears stream down his cheeks. 
EDWARDS (O.S.) Were you an alcoholic? 
FRANCES (O.S.) No. 
EDWARDS (O.S.) Were you a drug addict? 
FRANCES (O.S.) No. Never. 
ON THE SCREEN Edwards has moved Frances over to a seating area where various people from Frances' life are waiting, smiling at her. We've never seen any of them before. 
EDWARDS ...and over 200 producers have been invited to watch your appearance here tonight... so who knows, Frances Farmer, anything's possible on your comeback trail! (indicating seating area) And since your friends tell me they have to drive you everywhere, look what we've got for you!

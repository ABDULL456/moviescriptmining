RASPY WOMAN (O.S.) What the hell are you doing to that baby?! 
He looks out his window and sees ANNIE CASSELL, his neighbor on the phone, watching him through her window.  She is a strange creature with very thick glasses.  We sense a uniquely profound intelligence behind all that armor. 
SAM Everything's so tiny, tiny.  Tiny. Everything.  Won't you please come over? Help.  I need somebody.  Won't you please please help me. 
ANNIE You know I can't do that.  What does her mother say? 
SAM Her mother?  Her mother said "This isn't my life.  I'm outta here when she comes. It didn't mean anything, Sam.  It was just one night.  The two of you.  That's all I need..." Annie, what if she's sick? 
EXT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 
ANNIE has her door open a crack.  Annie feels the baby's forehead.  Lucy stares up at her, quiet now, fascinated. 
ANNIE She's overheated and not eating enough. How often are you feeding her? 
SAM A lot, Gerber, Carnation, Gerber. 
ANNIE What's a lot? 
SAM Breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Three squares hot. 
ANNIE Babies need food every two hours, Sam. 
SAM Oh.  I'm sorry Lucy Diamond. ANNIE What time does the little diamond wake up? 
SAM She never really goes to sleep. 
ANNIE Okaaaay.  Well, let's assume she's up at six.  Keep your TV on Nickelodeon.  I want you to feed her first while "Bewitched" is on.  Then again, when "Hogan's Heroes" starts.  After that, well until "Father Knows Best..." 
CUT: 
INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - EVENING 
We are watching "Hogan's Heroes".  We hear SHULTZ'S INFAMOUS RESPONSE: "I know nothing, absolutely nothing!"  Sam feeds a content Lucy. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - LATER 
"Father Knows Best" on TV.  Lucy blissfully falls asleep in Sam's arms.  Euphoric, he tiptoes to the cradle and places her ever so gently, when suddenly, the FRONT DOOR FLIES OPEN. 
Sam's BEST FRIENDS DESCEND inside: IFTY, a Pakistani gentlemen with a gentle face and a wide smile, carrying a large stuffed giraffe with a bow on it.  BRAD, who sees himself as a real ladies man, in tight jeans and a Farrah Fawcett T-shirt; and ROBERT, highly paranoid, thinks the world's out to get him.  Lucy WAILS.  Sam RUNS to the CRIB. 
SAM What are you doing here now?!  Her first sound sleep, not a sound, not a sound. 
BRAD Eight years every Thursday Video Night and you forgot?! 
SAM Oh my god, Video Night.  First Thursday of the month.  Video night at Sam's house.  I'm sorry, I forgot. 
IFTY Becca's gone.  "Gone with the Wind" is a very sad movie. 
ROBERT Oh here we go...Everything changes now. Soon you'll forget about Wednesday night Denny's and Friday night Karaoke.  And I got hit by a car today. 
SAM You did? 
ROBERT It's probably that guy from the V.A. 
BRAD What guy? 
ROBERT (closing window) I can't discuss it.  And now this. 
Ifty makes ORIGAMI BIRDS out of newspapers.  Lucy's rapt. 
SAM She looks smart, doesn't she? 
IFTY Of course, look.  She's already reading the newspaper.  I have five smart sisters in Pakistan.  I am only brother. "Seven Brides for Seven Brothers" was a wonderful movie I forgot to bring last week for Video Night... 
BRAD Did you get "Blade Runner" for tonight? 
ROBERT Now it's all my fault?! 
BRUCE Don't tell me you forgot again.  I broke a date with a daydream to come here. 
There's a knock at the door.  Ifty goes to get it.  Brad moans when he sees his 65 YEAR OLD MOTHER, ESTELLE, standing in the doorway. 
BRAD Mom!  I told you Video Night's over at nine!  It's only six-thirty! 
SALESMAN (exasperated) If there's a God. 
BRAD Do we get a balloon with these? 
SALESMAN Yes. 
ROBERT All of us, or just her? 
SMASH CUT TO: EXT. STREET NEAR SHOE STORE - DAY 
Those new little brown shoes walking in between four pairs of man's shoes.  We move up from those shoes to see FIVE PAIR OF HANDS tightly clasping their balloons as they march victoriously down the street.  We MOVE IN on Lucy's little brown shoes skipping with joy and -- 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. SCHOOL FIELD - DAY 
Those same little shoes in the midst of a mass of black soccer cleats.  We move up and see Lucy in the middle of a fierce kids soccer game. 
Score's tied.  The ball comes to Lucy.  She kicks and misses. From the sidelines we hear: 
SAM Beautiful kick!  Very close! 
Lucy looks up at her dad proudly.  The ball comes again. Nobody could miss this one.  But Lucy does. 
SAM (CONT'D) Thatta girl!  Thatta girl!  They're getting scared now! 
The game continues.  The GOALIE'S FATHER, DUNCAN RHODES, handsome, commanding and dressed in a suit, calls to his son: 
MR. RHODES C'mon, Conner!  On your toes!  They're all counting on you! 
Conner tenses up, alert under the pressure.  Meanwhile, down at the other end, the ball heads toward Lucy.  She kicks it! Hard.  Right into her team's own goal.  The crowd GROANS. 
SAM Hurray, Lucy!  You're getting the hang of it now!  You've got them scared now! 
Lucy's bursting with confidence, plows toward the ball and NAILS IT!  The ball goes flying.  The parents in the stand are completely baffled!  Sam is completely ecstatic! 
SAM (CONT'D) L-u-c-y!  That's our battlecry! 
The ball heads into the goal, just passing the goalie, Conner.  Sam runs to embrace Lucy when he hears Duncan reaming his son -- 
MR. RHODES The whole game was right in front of your nose!  I leave work early to watch you blow the whole game!? 
Conner slouches against the fence as his father walks away. Seeing this, Sam whispers to Lucy. 
INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON 
A child's hand double jumps across a checker board. 
CONNER (O.S.) Ha! 
Lucy and Conner are playing checkers while Sam cooks dinner. Two carrots cut into ten pieces. Bow Tie Pasta - 35 pieces each. 
CONNER (CONT'D) What's wrong with your father?  Why's he acting like a retard? 
LUCY He is. 
Their hands graze against each other on the check board - he pulls his hand away. 
CONNER Are you? 
LUCY No. 
CONNER Are you sure? 
LUCY Yeah. 
CONNER How do you know? 
LUCY He told me. 
CONNER But he's a retard. 
LUCY Yeah well it takes one to know one! 
He crowns her - her eyes shift to Sam in the kitchen, for the first time a bit uneasily. 
INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
LILY I can be a mother.  A real good mother. 
SAM Oh, good.  Good. 
LILY I could even spank you. 
SAM Oh no no no.  I don't believe in that. 
LILY Okay okay.  I can be very gentle. 
SAM Gentle.  Gentle.  Yes.  Do you tell stories? 
LILY I got stories up the wazoo.  Why don't you come with me.  I'll tell you a nice story. 
SAM I have to pick up Lucy at Annie's first. 
LILY A menage a toi? 
SAM French, French the language of France. You could teach my daughter, Lucy. 
LILY Your daughter?!  Can't you pick her up after?! 
SAM After?!  No no, Lucy comes too. 
LILY Whatever. 
She takes Sam's hand, they move to get on the bus JUST AS ANOTHER HAND brusquely lands on theirs. 
COP Not so fast.  You're under arrest. Solicitation. 
LILY He wanted to bring his kid, I said no. 
A lightbulb flashes and we -- SMASH CUT TO: 
INT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS - THAT NIGHT 
Sam blinks as his MUGSHOT is being taken.  Now the profile. He turns so they can get the back of his head.  Now the FINGERPRINT. 
Now Sam, in the corner of the room, on the phone making thumbprints on the wall.  While the COP discusses his case with a social worker, MARGARET BROWN.  Over the years she's seen it all, and to get through it has had to pretend it's just a job. 
COP It's the first time in nineteen years I actually believe the guy when he says he didn't know she was a hooker -- 
MARGARET BROWN You say that like it's a good thing. 
SAM ...Your teeth don't sound like they were brushed.  Do it with me now. 
COP Let him go.  He says he's never spent a night away from his kid... Come with me - I got a guy who beat the shit out of his two year old.  Again. 
Her cell phone beeps. 
MARGARET BROWN Yes.  I am seeing you tomorrow, Mr. Rabins.  She's still screaming?  No, McDonald's won't help...she's four months old. 
SAM Thirteen up...not on the gum line not on the gum line, 1, 2, 3. 
Margaret watches Sam as he talks to Lucy on the phone. 
INT. PRINCIPALS OFFICE - DAY 
The WALLS are lined with CHILDREN'S ART.  Various interpretations of the family.  We stop at one of a very small man and a very big little girl with her arm around him. 
MISS WRIGHT It gives us a great deal of insight into what she must be feeling.  And in the classroom, it's becoming clear she's holding herself back.  It's as if she's literally afraid to learn. 
We PULL BACK and see Sam staring at the picture.  Mrs. Wright and the principal watch him. 
MISS WRIGHT (CONT'D) No one doubts that you love your daughter, Mr. Dawson.  But the Department of Social Services contacted us.  They shared with us that your records show that your intellectual capacity is around that of a seven year old.  Our concern is what happens when Lucy turns eight? 
PRINCIPAL Mr. Dawson, do you understand what Miss Wright is trying to tell you about Lucy? 
SAM No one wanted The Beatles to break up. But you can hear it on the White Album. They were going in different directions. 
INT. LUCY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
It's bedtime.  Sam and Lucy are reading from "STELLALUNA". 
LUCY How can we be so dif..dif...I don't know that word. 
SAM Yes you do.  It starts with a "d" -- 
Sam happily eats his fish special with six new potatoes. Lucy's untouched dinner sits in the middle of the table.  She doodles on the placement - drawing a man sitting with a pile of new potatoes in front of him; larger than he is. 
SAM Fish and chips fish and chips.  I will not eat fish and chips. 
LUCY (exploding) I will not eat them here or there!  I will not eat them anywhere!  I will not eat green eggs and ham!  I will not eat them, Sam I am! 
INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Balloons and a banner reading "Happy Birthday, Lucy!"  For Lucy's birthday, Sam has rented a moon bounce - which sits in the center of the apartment and filling the entire place - leaving no room for the few kids and their parents.  Brad stands too close to a young attractive mother.  Robert shakes all the presents suspiciously. 
SAM Now when they come through the door, everybody yell "Surprise!"  Do you want to rehearse again? 
CONNER No.  I bet she already knows. 
ROBERT I didn't tell her.  Did Brad say I did? 
There's a KNOCK at the door. 
SAM Is that Lucy?  Annie's supposed to call and warn us.  Shhhh, everyone. 
Brad hits the lights.  Sam OPENS THE DOOR and everyone yells "SURPRISE!"  But instead of Lucy, it's the Social Worker. 
MARGARET BROWN I don't know if you remember me.  I'm Margaret Brown from Children's Social Services.  We met at the police station. 
SAM Put your present over there - Hurry up! Lucy might be on her way. (the phone rings) Hello?  Annie says she's coming up the stairs.  Everyone be quiet.  Assume surprise positions! (Conner keeps talking) Be quiet!  Assume surprise positions! 
CONNER Oh brother! 
SAM Why are you such a party pooper?! Assume surprise positions! 
CONNER Make me! 
Sam puts a hand over Conner's mouth; Conner struggles against him. 
MR. RHODES Hey! 
SAM He's gonna ruin the surprise!  He's gonna ruin the surprise! 
CONNER He touched me!  I've got cooties!  I've got cooties! 
MR. RHODES Get your hands off my boy! 
Conner's father hurls Sam across the room - Sam gets tangled in the MOON BOUNCE!  To get attention, Conner bursts into tears.  We hear FOOTSTEPS outside the door - Brad hits the lights.  We hear a CRASH!  And in the light, the DOOR SHEDS as it opens, Lucy and Ifty see - that MOONBOUNCE, swaying. Then from within the Moonbounce: 
SAM Surprise!  Happy Birthday! 
Lucy stands frozen, holding a red balloon. 
LUCY Daddy?! 
CONNER You don't have to call him "Daddy". (in Sam's face) She says you're not her real father, anyway.  She's adopted! 
Humiliated, Lucy RUNS AWAY!  The Social Worker watches, profoundly concerned, and reaches for her cellular phone. 
EXT. WALMART - DAY 
A police car pulls into the parking lot.  Sam and Margaret in the back.  Sam and Margaret see Lucy's little feet dangling from beneath the curtain of the photo booth. 
SAM I'll go get her. 
MARGARET BROWN It would be better if you stay here. I'm sorry to say this, Mr. Dawson, it's clear how much you love your daughter, but we're going to have to remove Lucy from your home. 
Sam's baffled.  One cop places his hand on Sam's shoulder, restraining him.  The OTHER heads toward the photo booth. 
SAM No, no no no.  It's her birthday!  It's her birthday! 
MARGARET BROWN I know how hard this must be... (cell phone rings) ...Hello, Betsy.  I'm scheduled to come to your apartment at four.  No, not five every two hours.  It's two every five hours.  She only weighs thirty pounds for chrissakes... (back to Sam) The city has given me the difficult task of deciding when to intervene on behalf of the child.  Unfortunately, I've learned the hard way that it's better too soon than too late.  For now the court will decide what's in Lucy's best interest. 
Sam watches the cop's legs meet Lucy's under the curtain. Suddenly, Sam screams from the deepest core of his being. 
SAM Run, Lucy, run! 
We see LUCY'S FEET KICK the COP'S LEGS and wrestle out of his grasp.  She flies out the booth, holding that balloon.  She runs down the street, the balloon soaring into the sky - a cop follows.  Sam struggles. 
ON SAM 
Reeling, devastated, we HEAR A JUDGE speaking: 
RITA Because it wasn't my fault. 
PATRICIA I -- 
RITA Thank you, Patricia. 
PATRICIA This is Mr. Dawson.  There was some confusion with the temp last week and -- 
RITA Mr. Dawson, it's a pleasure.  Since somebody made a mistake, unfortunately we only have a little time.  Hold all my calls unless it's my kid - I'll have a double cap. 
SAM Good choice, very good choice. 
RITA Can we get you anything to drink? 
SAM Is it free? 
ON RITA 
Hmmmm? 
TEN MINUTES LATER -- 
Sam is in the middle of the beginning of his story.  Rita on her second cappuccino, eyes her computer screen for calls. 
SAM (CONT'D) ...Lucy had an ice-cream cake with pink flowers - pink, not white not white...Lucy's favorite is cherry vanilla which is pink, too.  Cherries and vanilla. 
RITA Uh huh uh huh -- uh huh uh (into Amtel) If that's Jake Hiller, put him through. (picking up phone) Jake.  No no no no no no. 
PATRICIA (from speaker) Your son's on line two. 
RITA Jake, did you get that?! (to Patricia) Tell him to hold for just one second. Jake I have to go...he what? 
PATRICIA (through speaker) Deborah Chapman on line three -- 
RITA Hold on Jake. (she punches another line) No no no no no no no.  Have a nice weekend. (punches another button) Jake?! 
We HEAR MUSIC coming from the other end of the phone -- 
SAM Burt Bacharach shared billing with The Beatles and Jose Jiminez on the Ed Sullivan Show June 5th, 1968. 
RITA Really? (then) Jake, what'd you say you tell him yes I am. (yelling; re: coffee) This tastes like low, are you sure it's non?  Okay okay okay.  I think there's been a little mistake here -- 
SAM Yes.  A little one.  Your son's on line two. 
RITA Oh my God. (pushes another line) Danny? (Danny's hung up) Patricia?  Get Danny back.  Well keep trying. 
She unconsciously digs through the bowl of jelly beans on her desk sorting out all the yellow ones. 
RITA (CONT'D) Mr. Dawson, what I'm trying to say is I'm a divorce lawyer and as much as I'd like to, I don't handle cases like yours 
SAM Since you would like to, why don't you talk to your boss.  Maybe he would let you. 
She pours the bowl of jelly beans onto her desk, now frantically sorting through them. 
RITA (into phone) Then keep dialing -- (to Sam) What I mean is that at this point in my career, I can't afford to. 
SAM I earn eight dollars an hour at Starbucks.  I can pay your hourly rate, rate by the hour, hourly -- 
Rita stands up, ushering him to the door. 
RITA Mr. Dawson, I'm sorry, I have to be in court in eight minutes with the Kresges. You understand, good luck to you and don't give up. 
She turns, ahhhh!  He's gone!  She begins searching the room. 
RITA (CONT'D) Patricia?!  Where are my keys?  Where the hell are my keys?!  Alright alright. (replaying) I walked into the room - I went over here - I looked at my desk - I put my coat down - Patricia?!  Where's my coat? 
SAM (O.S.) Is there a child involved in Mr. Kresges' case? 
Stunned, Rita looks up and sees Sam holding up a strip of photos taken at the birthday booth. 
RITA No. 
SAM This is Lucy.  One year old.  First word, "apple".  December third.  3:16 p.m.  December third. 
Out of his pocket he pulls another photo strip. 
SAM (CONT'D) Here's Lucy two years old.  First merry go-round ride.  June 6th.  4:13 p.m. June 6th.  Here's Lucy.  Seven years old.  The day the police took her away. 
Muffled laughter from her colleagues. 
RITA You think I don't pro-bono?..I can do pro-bono.. I can do Goddamn pro-bono.. where the hell are my keys..hold the door! 
Rita runs to the open elevator and comes face to face with Sam who's been holding the door open for her. 
INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS 
The door closes.  Rita is trapped with Sam.  She stares forward trying to will him not there.  Rita gulps her champagne. 
SAM 32nd floor.  32 floors more.  31st floor.  31 floors more... 
And on and on and on.  Rita is about to spontaneously combust.  Finally, "G" - Rita bolts out the elevator doors, then just as suddenly turns around. 
RITA Alright, alright I'll take you. Alright, Goddammitt, I'll take you. 
SAM Oh my God oh my God!  Rubel Bly Harrison and Williams! 
Sam, shaking with relief, pulls out his wallet just as the elevator door starts closing. 
RITA No, no  no.  Pro-bono.  Alright?  Pro bono. 
The doors close.  We hear from within, as Sam goes up again: 
SAM (O.S.) Yes!  Alright!  I liked Sonny Bono too! 
INT. BUS - MORNING 
Sam stares out the window at an unfamiliar neighborhood.  On his lap, the pink box, now ripped, allowing us to see Lucy's birthday cake.  It's lopsided from having been thawed and refrozen. 
EXT. BUS STOP - NOON 
Sam waits for his transfer.  He sets the cake down on the bench and takes out a piece of paper with directions written on it.  The number 43 bus pull sup and Sam consults his paper once more before jumping on, forgetting the cake. 
The bus goes half a block before it SCREECHES to a halt.  Sam jumps off and runs back for the cake, but the bus continues on its way.  Moments later, the NUMBER 34 bus pulls up. Flustered and worried about being late, Sam jumps on.  He feels something cold on his hand, looks down, the box is starting to leak ice cream. 
INT. SOCIAL WORKERS OFFICE - DAY 
Lucy, Margaret, a therapist and a child psychologist wait for Sam. 
MARGARET BROWN Lucy, I'm sorry.  But it doesn't look like he's going to make it. 
LUCY (staring forward) He'll be here.  You smell like soap. 
MARGARET BROWN Lucy, he's an hour and 45 minutes late. You'll only have a few minutes left. 
Suddenly through the door comes Sam CARRYING THE MELTED, DRIPPING birthday cake.  Lucy runs to him. 
LUCY Daddy!  I told you I told you! 
CUT TO: 
INT. THE SOCIAL WORKER'S SMALL GREY OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER 
Margaret, the therapist (Ms. Geller), and the Child Pscyhologist all write voraciously into note pads as they observe Sam and Lucy who sit in the center of the room, nervous under their scrutiny. 
SAM ...and she's a Century City lawyer - a very famous lawyer.  Guess what her name is?  Rita Harrison. 
LUCY (jaw drops) Lovely Rita Meter Maid. 
SAM Harrison.  Just like George. 
They move to hug each other.  EVERYONE REACHES for their pens.  Sam pulls back self-consciously.  Everyone writes even harder. 
SAM (CONT'D) You've grown. 
LUCY Have I? 
SAM Your ears are larger.  And your eyes are older. 
He's right.  Her eyes are older.  He hugs her - ALL THE PENS GO UP. 
SAM (CONT'D) I'm gonna get a phone machine.  Next paycheck.  If I'm not home, you can leave a message.  "Hi, This is Lucy." 
LUCY You can't afford a phone machine. 
The writing starts again. 
RITA No.  Well, sort of.  I talk about her the whole time I'm there. 
SAM That's nice.  Did you notice that everyone else is driving slower.  I noticed that did you? 
RITA (on the horn) Go for Chrissakes!  How about your mother?  Maybe she can help you - 
SAM She's gone.  She's at the Park Lane Mortuary.  Two from the left.  Under the big tree. 
RITA Oh.  I'm sorry.  The light is green! WOULD YOU MOVE MOVE MOVE!? 
She cuts around the car in front of her; flips him off, and in a split second that her head is turned, almost SMASHES into the car in front of her!  She slams on the brakes. 
SAM Too many shrinks...I'm sorry Mrs. Dawson, if I were you I wouldn't waste any more time.  I'm sorry Mrs. Dawson it must be a tremendous disappointment. I'm sorry Mrs. Dawson I think you'd both be happier if Sam was in a home. 
Rita looks over at Sam, forced to stop. 
INT. PSYCHOLOGIST OFFICE - DAY 
Sam sits across from a shrink, MS. GELLER, nervously straightening her desk. 
PSYCHOLOGIST Mr. Dawson, you do understand, that since I am a court appointed psychologist, the traditional client therapist confidentiality will be waived. (Sam looks confused) Mr. Dawson, do you understand that the confidentiality will be waived? 
Sam nods nervously and waves.  With that she begins. 
INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Sam, Ifty, Brad and Robert hover over a used answering machine.  Ifty pours over the instructions. 
IFTY Before you read your message press the red button for record, when you finish, press the yellow button.  If you press the green button, it will play it back you.  Let's start with the "ogm". 
SAM Okay, okay.  I'm ready.  Hello, I am Sam. 
IFTY No, no.  I didn't press the red button. 
SAM Oh, yes.  False start, false start. 
IFTY It's not working.  That's what you get for buying a used machine.  Used means broken.  You're asking for other people's problems, you have enough of your own, not that everyone doesn't have problems. 
BRAD It's not used.  It's pre-owned.  Guy bought it for his auto shop and then he got a secretary. 
IFTY Testing, one two three. 
SAM That's a good code.  I'll remember that. One, two, three. 
IFTY (pressing button) Quick, you're recording. 
SAM I'm hi.  I am Sam.  I'm not home. 
ROBERT No, you don't want to say that.  you don't want them to know you're not home. 
SAM But then I'm lying. 
ROBERT Everybody's lying. 
SAM I'm not a liar.  It will send a mixed message to Lucy. 
IFTY (pressing the button) You're on the air! 
SAM Let me see, let me see, let me see.  Hi, how are you? 
BEEP! the tape runs out. 
IFTY That was pretty good.  That was natural. 
SAM Did I sound like a good father? 
IFTY It's the outgoing message.  You need to sound more outgoing.  Let's start again. INT. GROUP HOME - NIGHT 
Mrs. Kerry unlocks the phone and dials.  She hands the phone to Lucy who waits eagerly in her pj's.  Sam's answering machine clicks on; as if on slow speed. 
ANSWERING MACHINE Hi, it's Len's Auto Body Shop.  We'd love to show you our body work, but it's invisible.  Leave it at the beep. 
LUCY Try again.  You must have dialed the wrong number. 
INT. RITA'S OFFICE - DAY 
Rita and Sam walk through the lobby at Rita's Olympic pace. She passes the elevator and heads for the stairs. 
EXT. STREETS - DAY 
Rita stands next to her Porsche.  There are Starbucks in every direction she looks. 
INT. STARBUCKS - DAY 
Sam is straightening Sweet and Lows.  Rita barrels in. 
RITA Look I don't think you understand what you're up against we have to be in court in three days and we don't have a decent witness.  Now you've gotta know someone who can testify who's been to college - or has a degree of some kind - or some sort of way of expressing themselves that's gonna make the court believe that you deserve to get your daughter back I need a coffee.  Big.  Tall. 
SAM Tall's the smallest. 
RITA Of course.  Of course, whatever.  Okay okay okay.  Damn!  I forgot to call back no I did and once you think of this person and there has to be one person - I want you to call me at work - because I'm going back there now to my seven other cases -- (her cellphone RINGS) What?  Mrs. Robeck?  I'm on my way, the traffic's horrible on the 405.  Dorothy, we put in five months lets not let a three car pile up..I know it's been enormously stressful.. Your Esczema? Oh, honey, nobody notices..AH!  They opened a lane! 
SAM (too loudly) Do you want it here or to go? 
RITA (dial tone) Dorothy?  Dorothy?  No no no I didn't stare at the eczema for five months for - 
She takes out her car beeper, clicks it towards the window and realizes that they're towing her car! 
RITA (CONT'D) Sonuvabitch! INT. ANNIE'S APARTMENT - EVENING 
Annie is at the piano, lost in a Beethoven concerto. 
SAM Annie, it's one day.  One hour.  Maybe only 53 minutes.  Lucy needs you. (Annie keeps playing) You went to college.  You can give the right answers. 
Annie plays even harder.  Frustrated, he POUNDS the piano. 
SAM (CONT'D) We can't lose her. 
ANNIE I can't.  I'd make it worse for you.  I can't do it.  Don't you think I would if I could? 
CUT TO: 
INT. COURTROOM - DAY 
We HEAR A VOICE: 
VOICE (O.S.) All rise for the Honorable Judge Phillip McNeily. 
Sam stands along with others in the courtroom.  The Judge enters and sits.  Everyone else sits now, too.  Except Sam. Who continues to stand until Rita pulls him down.  Now we see: 
Ifty, Robert, Brad - and Brad's MOTHER, who sits several seats behind Brad knitting.  Robert holds up a handmade sign from the back of the courtroom "Free Lucy Dawson". 
INT. COURTROOM - ONE HOUR LATER 
Turner, the prosecuting attorney, examines his first witness. He's disheveled, but don't let the rumpled suit fool you. This man is razor-sharp.  The THERAPIST who evaluated Sam is on the stand.  Sam anxiously rearranges all the pens on the desk he sits at with Rita.  Projected on a SCREEN is a SLIDE of the drawing Lucy made in school. 
THERAPIST ...there is an unhealthy reversal of roles here. As you can see from her drawings, she has an exaggerated sense of responsibility.  Lucy feels she has to take care of her father.  Although at her birthday party her true feelings about her father were revealed. 
RITA Objection.  "True feelings revealed"?! 
TURNER The state is paying Miss Geller for her opinions - 
RITA Then every child who rages because they didn't get to stay up for that extra hour of TV - 
TURNER Objection your honor - 
Sam TUGS at Rita's sleeve.  She ignores it. 
RITA ...in fact any child who said they hated their parents because they didn't want to take a bath would be a prime candidate for Foster Care. 
TURNER Objection. 
SAM I think they want you to stop. 
RITA Really?!  Thank you, Sam. 
JUDGE MCNEILY We all appreciate your assistance Mr. Dawson - continue with your witness, Mr. Turner. 
TURNER Now Ms. Geller, I assume in your therapy session, Mr. Dawson extolled his parenting abilities. 
THERAPIST On the contrary, Mr. Dawson admitted he felt profoundly inadequate - that he was terrified he'd made and would continue to make - and I quote: "Huge mistakes, huge mistakes, mistakes that are huge." 
TURNER No further questions. 
Rita starts to scribble notes furiously.  So does Sam. Turner smugly sits down.  Rita confidently strides toward the witness. 
RITA I didn't say that. 
SAM You're my lawyer and you think what they think.  I don't have a chance.  No chance at all.  Even with an expert witness. 
Rita looks at him.  He's right.  She chooses her words carefully. 
RITA I think...you deserve...a fair trial. 
SAM Answer the question. 
RITA Okay okay okay.  What was the question again? 
SAM Do you think what they think?  Sam can't order food.  Sam can't pay a check.  Sam can't take care of Lucy? 
RITA It doesn't matter what I think - it matters that we win. 
SAM You're my lawyer it matters what you think. 
RITA Hey, it doesn't matter to them what I think. 
SAM Me.  It matters to me. 
He reaches for the receipt, and faces the CASHIER defiantly. 
SAM (CONT'D) Fourteen thirty three.  That's 5 ones, 2 quarters and 16 cents less than twenty. 
He slowly counts his money, takes his tray and walks away. Rita watches him, with a trace of remorse and a hint of admiration. 
INT. COURTROOM - DAY 
DR. DONOVAN, an attractive soft-spoken woman is on the stand. Rita is working the room.  Sam, having a hard time concentrating, is following a crack up the wall and onto the ceiling. 
RITA Dr. Donovan, the American Medical Journal named you one of the country's leading oncologists.  Isn't that correct? 
DR. DONOVAN Yes. 
RITA What kept you going the twelve years you were in medical school? 
DR. DONOVAN Caffeine.  Sugar.  And my mother's confidence in me. 
RITA I wish I had a mother like that.  She must have been smart. 
DR. DONOVAN She had great instincts. 
RITA Do you have any idea what her IQ was? 
DR. DONOVAN In the lower ranges.  About eighty. 
RITA So your mother, this woman with the IQ of a nine-year old had the wisdom to recognize that you would be a great doctor.  I guess her disability didn't seem to hold you back in life. 
DR. DONOVAN No.  My mother's condition taught me what they can't teach you; compassion and patience. 
RITA Traits most doctors have in spades. Thank you, no further questions. 
Sam runs to hug Dr. Donovan, bumping into Rita who sits him down. 
TURNER How'd you get through medical school? Where'd you live? 
DR. DONOVAN We lived with my mother's parents. 
TURNER Oh, Grandma and Grandpa.  Would it be fair to say your grandparents were of normal intelligence? 
DR. DONOVAN Yes. 
TURNER And didn't these people - your grandparents - with normal intelligence - have the real responsibilities? 
RITA (relishing this) Objection!  I hear Mr. Turner's mother in-law lives with him!  She must help out.  Does that mean he doesn't have the real - 
TURNER Motion to strike that from the record. Irrelevant, immaterial and immature - 
RITA Irrelevant?!  Any parent has a right to a support system. 
TURNER I'm not talking about the rights of the parent, I'm talking about the rights of a child. (the gavel bangs) I'm talking about entrusting an eight year old's welfare in the hands of someone whose records show he was diagnosed with infantile autism, mental retardation... 
RITA Objection!  Motion to strike that from the record.  It's clear that one's intellectual capacity has no bearing on their ability to love.  You Honor, would you please instruct council to proceed with a modicum of sensitivity? 
TURNER Oh, I'm sensitive.  I'm real sensitive when I see people like you -- (the gavel BANGS!) come here and try to give meaning to your life by screwing up somebody else's! JUDGE MCNEILY That's enough.  Both lawyers approach the bench! 
A LONG SILENCE.  She stares at Turner defiantly. 
LUCY "All you need is love." 
INT. COURTROOM CORRIDOR - DAY 
WE HEAR THAT SONG as Sam and Rita walk out of the courtroom. Rita is breaking pieces off a candy bar she has stuffed in her purse.  They see Lucy running down the corridor toward Sam, Margaret Brown behind her. 
LUCY Daddy!  I did great, didn't I? 
SAM No, Lucy, you lied. 
LUCY Shhh!  Don't tell anyone. 
Rita watches Sam.  Moved by his concern as a parent. 
MARGARET BROWN Lucy, Mrs. Kerry's here to take you back. 
LUCY I thought you'd be proud of me.  Jo Jo's mom told him to lie on the stand and say he never saw a needle in the house; and he did, and now they're back together. 
SAM Jo Jo isn't us.  The truth, the truth, when the judge hears the truth, he'll know, he'll know we should be together. 
LUCY (bursting) Nobody's interested in the truth, Daddy. Nobody cares! 
They lead her down the hallway toward Mrs. Kerry - Sam's voice gets louder and louder - determined to make her hear. 
SAM I CARE!  DO YOU HEAR ME?  THE TRUTH. THE WHOLE TRUTH!  SO HELP ME GOD!! INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
The darkness of Sam's apartment.  We see him on his knees. Saying his prayers by his bedside. 
SAM Help me, God.  Help me, God.  Help me, God... 
We see ANNIE'S SILHOUETTE from the window of her apartment as it moves across the frame. 
INT. COURTROOM - DAY 
Turner cross examines George, the manager of Starbucks. 
GEORGE Sam's my most reliable employee.  He's never missed a day of work in eight years.  Always warm, always friendly. 
TURNER Admirable qualities for a single father. Mr. Walker, in these eight years, have Mr. Dawson's responsibilities, which...let me see...would include bussing tables, replenishing Sweet 'n Lows, and sweeping up the place... increased? 
GEORGE No.  Not really. 
TURNER And isn't that because he's mentally incapable of learning management skills or working the cash register or even making a cup of coffee? 
RITA Objection.  Leading the witness. 
JUDGE MCNEILY You may answer the question. 
George searches for a way to tell the truth. 
GEORGE Well as a matter of fact, Sam and I have been discussing a promotion that I was planning on putting into effect at the end of the week. 
Sam leaps to his feet. 
SAM Oh boy!  Thank you, George! 
Rita pulls him down.  Turner seizes the moment. 
TURNER Yes.  Thank you, George.  Now, after eight years, Sam can finally measure out a teaspoon of coffee and cup of water. Now, he must certainly be able to help Lucy with her geometry. 
RITA Objection - 
TURNER No further questions. 
INT. COURTROOM CORRIDOR - LATER 
Rita prepares Ifty. 
RITA ...and when I ask another question? 
IFTY I answer in one sentence. 
RITA Yes.  Short and sweet. 
IFTY Yes.  One sentence.  Short and sweet. My aunt was short and sweet.  But her cooking was too spicy she... 
TURNER Excuse me, Mr. Dawson? 
SAM I said that's enough!  I will not allow it!  Overruled!  Overruled!! 
Rita doesn't stop him.  The Judge hesitates, incredulous, then pounds the gavel as the courtroom erupts. EXT. SAM'S APARTMENT - DUSK 
Rita sits in her Porsche with Annie and Sam.  Annie is curled into a tight ball in the passenger seat.  Sam is tucked into the shelf in the back.  His legs kick Rita in the face with every gear shift. 
RITA Thank you again, Annie.  You were truly extraordinary. 
SAM Extraordinary.  Truly extraordinary. 
Annie doesn't move. 
RITA Okay okay okay okay.  Well, Sam has his big day on the stand tomorrow and we need to work a little bit so that he's as effective as you were. 
SAM Effective.  Very effective. 
RITA On a Porsche, the, uh, the door handle is a little hidden by that thingamajig, so if you're having a hard time finding it I'll just -- 
Rita reaches across to open Annie's door when she SCREAMS! 
ANNIE Noooooooo! 
SAM Annie's not quite ready to go outside yet. 
RITA Okay, we'll just take our time. 
INT. PORSCHE - TWO HOURS LATER 
It's dark now.  Annie is still catatonic.  Rita's on the car phone, the kind that voice activates and she's yelling. 
RITA Home!  Home!  HOME GODDAMNIT!  Juanita, help Danny with his English assignment. Ayude Danny un story...story...STORIO! 
ANNIE (rising from the dead) I'm ready now. 
RITA (gently) Good, fine, Sam?  Annie's ready. 
Sam's fallen asleep. 
EXT. RITA'S LAVISH BEL AIR HOME - NIGHT 
Rita and Sam enter. 
INT. RITA'S BEL AIR HOME - NIGHT 
Sam is awestruck at the magnificent home. 
RITA Okay okay okay okay.  We'll work in the library.  It's down the hall and to the left. 
They pass another room and see Danny zoned out in front of the wide-screen TV watching MUTANT NINJA TURTLES. 
RITA (CONT'D) Hey, Danny. (no answer) Where's your father? 
DANNY (staring at TV) Guess. 
RITA I don't want to guess.  Where is he? (Sam watches Rita) I told you I don't want to guess. 
DANNY Well where was he last night? 
RITA Working late. 
DANNY There you guessed it. 
RITA He said he was working late? 
DANNY That's what he said. 
RITA Well who did he say was taking care of you? 
DANNY You.  But you said you were working late. 
RITA I am working late. 
DANNY Then go work. 
RITA How was your day? 
SAM Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah.  I didn't harass him, Mr. Turner.  Mr. Turner - (Sam can't keep a straight face) You don't look like him. 
RITA That's a blessing. 
SAM You're so much prettier. 
RITA (suddenly shy) Thank you.  Now. What makes you think you can take care of a woman - I mean a young child - when you have a hard time taking care of yourself? 
INT. RITA'S LIBRARY - TWO HOURS LATER 
Rita is relentless.  Sam is exhausted but determined. 
RITA But who are you kidding?  Isn't Lucy already smarter than you? 
SAM In some ways.  But in other ways, she's not, I think. 
RITA You think? 
SAM I think. 
RITA Sam.  You've got to be firm on this. 
SAM I think in other ways I'm smarter than her.  Smarter than you are, Mr. Turner. In fact, in some ways I'm smarter than you, Judge McNeilly. 
RITA Whoa!  Bring it down. 
SAM What parent doesn't want more for their child?  To be more than the sum of the parts of the whole of them. 
RITA Yeah yeah yeah, but it's one thing for a little girl to love her daddy when she's a baby, but once she loses respect for you, what will you do? 
SAM (fierce) I won't let that happen.  I won't. 
RITA How can you say that? 
SAM Respect is not just about how smart someone is.  Smart is not just about how smart someone is. 
RITA But what about Lucy?  Aren't you being selfish?  Doesn't she deserve a better life?  Don't you think she's just pretending she's happy to not hurt your feelings? 
Sam jumps up from the table, trembling with anger. 
SAM Lucy is happy!  We have fun!  We go to Denny's, we go to video night.  I know how to love her.  I know I'm not going to able to go to law school and learn how to be a mean person, but I know how to love.  I know how to be her father, Mr. Turner! 
By this time he is face to face with Rita, breathing hard, overcome with emotion.  Rita is unexpectedly near tears. Suddenly before she knows it, she is HOLDING SAM.  The room charged.  She speaks tenderly, moved by this awkward boy/man. 
RITA I know you do, Sam.  I know you do. INT. STARBUCKS - MORNING 
Sam rushes into the coffee shop in his new suit. 
GEORGE You look great, Sam.  What time do you have to be in court? 
SAM Half day, half day.  I take the stand at two. 
George leads him behind the counter.  THE STAFF BEAMS. Euphorically, Sam approaches the huge espresso machines. 
GEORGE Okay, we need two grande cappucinos, non fat. 
SAM Sprinkles or Cinnamon? 
INT. STARBUCKS - 11:00 A.M. 
Sam is doing great.  He's humming as he prepares a triple latte with the precision of a Swiss watchmaker. 
INT. STARBUCKS - 12:00 P.M. 
The place is packed, including a GROUP OF JAPANESE TOURISTS. Sam zips around, trying to juggle between the blender, the espresso machine, steamed milk, icemaker, all the while glancing up at the clock.  Sam hands three cups to customers, the foam overflowing, coffee spilling out. 
A CUSTOMER takes a sip and SPITS IT OUT. 
GUY What is this?  I ordered an Americano, not a latte. 
SAM Americano, Americano, not a latte. 
Working as fast as he can but still NOT FAST ENOUGH, Sam unconsciously drinks the latte. 
INT. STARBUCKS - 12:45 P.M. 
Hyped on coffee, Sam is zooming around and he's a mess. Shirt hangs out, coffee stains on it, his hair wild. Frazzled, he forgets to put the lid on the blender and turns it ON.  A mint mocha frappuccino SPLATTERS HIM in the face. At that moment, George comes out of his office. 
SAM No. 
TURNER Well then where were you living? 
SAM (very quietly) In an institution. 
TURNER So your parents put you in an institution? 
SAM Only after my mom got sick. 
TURNER What about your father?  Where was he? 
SAM Gone with the wind when Sam was born. 
TURNER So, you weren't raised by your mother? 
SAM I saw her I saw her. 
TURNER When? 
SAM Christmas, Easter and my birthday. 
TURNER Oh, once a year on your birthday.  So in a way, the people at the institution were your parents.  Were they nice to you? 
SAM Some yes.  Some on.  Some yes. 
TURNER Did they hit you? 
SAM Sometimes.  Sometimes they did sometimes. 
TURNER Like when you hit Lucy's friend at her birthday party? 
RITA Objection!  Nobody hit anybody! 
TURNER Let me rephrase that, strong-armed.  So what role model do you call upon as a father when you're parenting Lucy?  The head of the institution?  The Principal the warden? 
SAM No.  Not Mr. Whitehead.  Not him. 
TURNER Then who? 
SAM Myself. 
TURNER you have the mental capacity of a seven year old.  So you ask yourself, a seven year old - 
SAM I am not a seven-year old. 
TURNER How to parent a fellow seven-year old? 
SAM Yes.  No.  What was the question? 
TURNER The question is: what makes you think you can be a parent?  Your background? Your IQ?  Your friends who can't even testify for you? 
RITA Objection - 
SAM My friends - 
RITA Objection - 
SAM My friends love Lucy even if Rita thought they weren't smart enough to testify.  Even if she said you'd wipe the floor with them. 
ON RITA 
Trying to telepathically reach Sam. 
TURNER Excuse me, Mr. Dawson, your lawyer just objected; that means you didn't have to answer the question.  You can't even follow the simple rules you've watched here day after day.  You really think you can raise a seven-year old?  A ten year old?  A thirteen-year old? (in his face) That means she'll be six years more advanced than you. 
Sweat pours down Sam's coffee stained collar.  He searches for words.  Then from the clearest place inside himself: 
SAM I've had a lot of time to think about whatever it is that makes somebody a good parent.  It has to do with constancy.  It has to do with patience. It has to do with listening.  To pretending to listen when you can't even listen anymore. 
The court is riveted by Sam's eloquence.  Rita's amazed. 
SAM (CONT'D) It has to do with love, like she says... 
Rita's antenna goes up: who's "she?" 
SAM (CONT'D) And I don't know where it's written that a woman has a corner on that market, that a man has any less of those emotions than a woman.  Billy has a home with me!  It's not perfect!  I'm not a perfect parent!  Sometimes I forget he's just a little kid... (whispers from the courtroom) We built a life together and we love each other and if you destroy that, it may be irrep, irrep, irrep... 
He can't let her go.  That he can't do.  Margaret, steel herself, turns to Rita, no matter how many times she's done this. 
MARGARET BROWN Please help me. 
Rita, aching from a place she thought she buried long ago, shakes her head, NO.  Now, Margaret literally has to wrench Lucy away from her father's arms.  Lucy bellowing as she pulls her down the hallway.  Sam is frozen in incalculable pain. 
EXT. SAM'S APARTMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT 
We hear "Fool on the Hill".  We follow a trail of PINK LIQUID melting down the hall and come to Annie's door where a pile of grocery bags and newspapers sit in a PUDDLE OF STRAWBERRY ICE CREAM.  Suddenly, the needle SCRAPES LOUDLY across the record, followed by a mysterious POUNDING against the wall. 
INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
The CAMERA MOVES to the WINDOW.  Inside, the lights are dim. Lucy's HAMMOCK SWINGS EMPTY, ghostlike.  Sam, curled into a ball in Lucy's bare corner, bangs his head over and over again against the wall, overcome with grief. 
INT. DANNY'S ROOM - RITA'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
The POUNDING CONTINUES as we see Rita standing in the doorway, watching her sleeping child.  This stranger that she's raised.  She moves to cover him, this tough little boy, when she sees POOH BEAR tucked under his arm.  She tucks them both in, tenderly. 
EXT. CARPENTER HOUSE - DAY 
Saturday in idyllic suburbia.  Sam, directions and a map in his hands, tentatively rounds the corner.  A small bouquet of flowers in his hands when he stops - STARING AHEAD AT -- 
REVERSE ANGLE 
Lucy looking absolutely radiant in a new spring dress.  She stands on the front porch with RANDY, who wears a red smock and is setting up TWO EASELS AND PAINTS.  There's a tiny chair for Lucy and a tiny chair for her. 
CLOSE ON LUCY AND RANDY 
The tension in Lucy's face, Randy straining to connect with her. 
RANDY Your teacher told me you were an artist. 
LUCY You wear too much perfume.  You're trying too hard. 
RANDY I am, aren't I.  Maybe you could teach me how to paint. 
LUCY My daddy's coming today.  We're going to open my birthday presents.  Why don't you just go do something. 
BACK TO SAM 
From where he stands, all he sees is Lucy getting everything she deserves.  He looks down at the tiny bouquet in his hand - feeling profoundly inadequate, he reaches for some flowers from a garden he's passing.  Puts them in his bouquet.  Then stops.  Feels guilty.  Tries to put the flowers BACK.  He stares up at Lucy on the porch a few houses away. 
Lucy sits on the steps.  Randy sits right next to her. 
BACK ON SAM 
Where he WAS standing, but is now GONE.  The flowers lay in the dirt.  From the porch, Lucy looks out and waits.  And waits.  And waits. 
INT. STARBUCKS - DAY 
It's Saturday.  The place is buzzing.  Sam listlessly cleans the tables, without the usual energy and verve.  A TODDLER marches around a table, playing under the adoring gaze of his parents. 
MAN Excuse me, my kid knocked over a coffee, could you clean this up? 
Sam sees a FAMILY at a table covered with spilled coffee. 
MAN (CONT'D) I said I need a refill and a towel over here. 
SAM (snapping) You need a towel?  A refill?  A glass of water?  You need more than you already have?  You have everything - (all his fury and frustration) Everything.  But it's not enough.  Take my daughter, too! 
Sam's out of control, the whole shop stares at him as he backs into a shelf of MUGS he so carefully arranged.  They CRASH onto the floor. 
SMASH CUT TO: 
EXT. CARPENTER PORCH - DAY 
Paints and brushes go FLYING across the porch as Lucy KNOCKS THEM OVER.  Totally out of control. 
LUCY You gave him the wrong address!  You're hiding me from him! 
As Randy reaches for her, Lucy pours black paint on her. 
EXT. CARPENTER HOUSE - DUSK 
Lucy sits in a ball on the corner of the porch.  Her eyes swollen from crying.  Finally, she gets up and moves to the tiny chair that Randy put out for her.  Straightens the easel and begins to paint. 
The front door opens and Randy comes out having washed her face and hair.  Without speaking, Randy straightens her easel and sits down next to Lucy and begins to paint.  Randy and Lucy paint in silence for a long time.  Then - 
RITA Is that what she said? 
SAM She didn't have to say it.  I may be stupid, but I know.  I know. 
RITA Well that's the first stupid thing I've ever heard you say. 
Sam looks at her through the window.  A CHINK in the wall. 
RITA (CONT'D) Sam, Sam you can get her back.  The court favors reunification.  The only thing that can block you is if the foster family petitions to adopt.  And from what I've heard, Lucy's making their life miserable - that's our girl. Sam, fight for her. 
SAM I tried.  I tried. 
RITA Try harder. 
SAM You don't know.  You don't know. 
RITA I don't know? 
SAM You don't know what it is to try and try and never get there.  You were born perfect, perfect. 
RITA Is that right?  Everyone else is perfect but only Sam feels loss and pain? 
SAM That's right.  People like you don't know. 
RITA People like me? 
SAM People like you don't know, don't know what hurt feels like, people like you don't feel, don't feel anything. 
She slaps him.  STUNNED, he slaps her back.  STUNNED, she slaps him again.  HE SLAPS HER.  She rips the newspaper wall down. 
RITA You think you got the market cornered on human suffering?  Well let me tell you something about "People like me." People like me feel little and lost and ugly and dispensable.  People like me have perfect husbands screwing someone far more perfect than me and my son, my son hates me, I try too hard and I push and he knows it and I talk in that voice, that voice I promised I'd never use, and I've screamed, I've screamed horrible things to him, a five year-old because he doesn't want to get in the car at the end of a day and he stares at me with such anger and I hate him then. I know I'm failing you, I know I'm disappointing you, I know you deserve better but get in the fucking car!  It's like every morning I wake up and fail, and I look around and anybody, anybody can pull it off, but somehow I can't. And I know, I know I have everything, and I'm still miserable and it's pathetic.  I know it's pathetic.  No matter how hard I try, something about me will never be enough. 
She's crying too hard to continue.  He pulls her to him. Before she realizes what's happening, she's holding him tightly.  He whispers in her ear. 
SAM You're enough.  You're so much more than enough. 
He looks her straight in the eye - she's undone by the intimacy of the moment, by the strength of his purity.  And staring into his eyes, she begins to sob, walls crumbling. He kisses her elbow, her shoulder, her forehead, her eyes, her tears.  And something ignites between them - something confused and scary and deep and filled with a passionate ache. 
SAM (CONT'D) Lovely Rita... 
On a bed of newspaper that was once a wall they come together, whole again. 
EXT. RANDY'S NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY 
Sam rounds the corner walking - or rather being walked by SIX DOGS, all shapes, all sizes.  He heads up the walkway to Randy's house.  She comes out of the house and shuts the door behind her, stopping him. 
RANDY You're early. 
SAM All the lights were green. 
RANDY There's a reason for the court schedule. You stopped showing up.  Lucy has had to rebuild her life. 
SAM I want her back.  I can do it.  I know I can. 
RANDY That's not up to me, but I'm telling you, I will do everything in my power to prevent Lucy from getting hurt again. 
Sam hangs his head.  A dog barks at Randy. 
RANDY (CONT'D) Whose dogs are these? 
SAM Supplemental income supplemental income - bathe, walk and feed.  Sam Dawson meets your canine needs. (to dogs) Sit! Sit! Sit! Sit! Sit! Sit! All the dogs sit but a BIG BLACK LAB.  Randy heads into the house.  The front door opens and Lucy comes out.  She runs down the stares to Sam.  Thrilled, Sam opens his arms to her. She leaps into them and begins slugging his chest with pent up fury. 
LUCY You never came!  You never even called! You forgot about me!  How could you forget me! 
SAM I never forgot you.  I forgot me. 
SAM (CONT'D) I hate you I hate you I hate you! 
Lucy pulls away.  A long charged silence.  Lucy refusing to even look at her father. 
SAM (CONT'D) Lucy, I tried to write you a letter last night... 
A BASSET HOUND SNEEZES. 
SAM (CONT'D) Gesundheit, Buster.  Buster has a cold. But the letter had too many big words. Pokey, sit. 
The black lab has begun eating Randy's flowers.  Lucy stares forward.  Sam speaks tentatively, carefully: 
Too long a pause.  Ifty looks at the clock. 
IFTY Oh my God!  6:35 is Video Night at my house and I'm not even there! 
ROBERT If we get there before you do we'll wait for you - check! 
BRAD Sam get your dessert to go. 
SAM This is very hard to say.  I'm having my dessert here.  With Rita.  I'm not coming to video night. 
Devastated, Ifty, Robert and Brad solemnly gather their things. 
RITA Sam - if you want to go... 
SAM I said no, Rita. 
RITA I know, but if you - 
SAM What?  Do you want me to go? 
RITA I didn't say that.  But do you want to go? 
SAM Where? 
RITA Nevermind. 
SAM Fine. 
RITA Fine. 
IFTY, ROBERT & BRAD Fine. 
They leave in a huff.  The WAITRESS delivers the check with dessert and coffee. 
RITA I've got it. 
SAM I've got it. 
Long pause.  Rita slowly eats her pie. 
SAM (CONT'D) It's good to chew.  You're eating more slowly. 
Rita laughs and nods. 
SAM (CONT'D) Coconut Rhubarb.  Sidebar, we need to talk.  Sidebar. 
RITA (carefully) Yes we do. 
SAM I need to get Lucy back.  We need, we need - to be professional. 
RITA Do you know what that means? 
SAM When dealing with Starbucks' customers, be friendly but not familiar.  I can be your friend. 
RITA (oddly touched) Thank you, Sam. 
SAM You need to leave your husband. 
RITA (her armor up again) Oh, my marriage isn't so bad. 
SAM 'Life is very short and there's no time for fussing and fighting, my friend.' 
RITA (undone) It's just...it's just that...I've never lost anything. 
EXT. SCHOOL - DAY 
Randy kisses Lucy goodbye as she heads toward school.  We follow Lucy - suddenly a BIRD SAILS THROUGH THE SKY and LANDS IN FRONT OF LUCY.  It's an ORIGAMI BIRD.  She looks around - but doesn't see Sam anywhere.  But she feels him.  She walks toward school, clutching the bird, past a tree and we move up that tree and see Sam nestled in the branches.  There.  They made contact. 
EXT. RANDY'S NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY 
It's later that week.  Lucy walks proudly down the street in a GIRL SCOUT UNIFORM, selling cookies.  Randy is by her side, beaming. 
LUCY We've made $22.36.  That's seven dollars, 64 cents less than thirty. 
RANDY Well that's one way of looking at it. 
EXT. RANDY'S NEIGHBORHOOD - LATER 
Randy and BILL, her husband, watch as Sam turns and walks purposely down the walkway - his houseslippers scuffling on the quiet street. 
SERIES OF SHOTS AT 3:00 A.M. -- 
EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
Lucy in her pj's walks down the middle of the street. 
EXT. SAM'S WINDOW - NIGHT 
Lucy knocks on Sam's window. 
EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
Lucy and Sam walk back down the street to Randy's house. 
EXT. SAM'S WINDOW - NIGHT 
Lucy lugs encyclopedias to Sam's windowsill. 
EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
Lucy in a blanket being carried by Sam toward Randy's house. 
INT. LUCY'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Until FINALLY, we see Lucy in her hammock at Randy's house looking out the windows, which have now been completely covered with BARS.  Her room is filled with origami birds from the 100 Denny's napkins, her birthday gift.  Lucy gets out of her hammock and tiptoes across her room - quietly opening the door. 
INT. CARPENTER HOUSE - STAIRS TO LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
We follow her through the dark house as she creeps down the stairs.  She gets to the front door.  It's been DEAD BOLTED where she cannot reach it.  From the darkness we hear -- 
RANDY (tenderly) Lucy.  Come here. 
Randy sits in the darkness, next to a THIRD OF A GLASS OF MILK and a HALF A DENNY'S BLUEBERRY MUFFIN. 
RANDY (CONT'D) I made us a midnight snack. 
Lucy stares at the muffin and milk.  Torn. 
RANDY (CONT'D) I understand that you want to see your daddy.  And I don't want to keep you from him.  I honestly don't.  So you tell me when you want to see him.  You can see him anytime you want.  But we have to arrange it first.  Do you understand? (Lucy nods) Now would you like a snack? 
Lucy nods.  Elated, Randy makes room for her on the couch. But Lucy just reaches for the milk and muffin and heads up the stairs then turns back and speaks gently to Randy. 
LUCY Thank you.  Goodnight. 
RANDY (words caught in her throat) Goodnight, Lucy. 
INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - DAY 
We PAN ACROSS THE ROOM and see Sam's shoes, his tie, and a YELLOW PAD WITH ALL THE PRESIDENTS LISTED IN ORDER.  A KNOCK at the door - Sam opens it to see Rita standing there, looking intensely vulnerable, holding her husband's suit. 
RITA My husband left this when he moved out. 
SAM Oh, lovely Rita, meter maid. 
RITA (entering) Nice place.  I worry.  I worry sometimes... 
SAM You worry you did the wrong thing? 
RITA I worry that I've gotten more out of this relationship than you. 
SAM No no no.  I'm the lucky one.  I have the lawyer that never loses. 
RITA (covering) That's me...okay, let me see, let me see, let me see. (pulls out notes) They're going to put Bill and Randy on the stand first and then you. 
SAM Them first, then me.  They're a nice couple.  They have a nice house.  She's pretty.  She's smart, too.  I can tell. The manager of the salad bar is gonna testify, isn't he?  That will help us. 
For a moment, Rita's mask drops and her fear for Sam overwhelms her. 
RITA Absolutely. 
SAM Nobody believed that George Harrison could really be a song writer.  But he wrote "Here Comes the Sun".  John and Paul said it was one of the best songs on ABBEY ROAD. 
RITA (tenderly) George was always my favorite Beatle. 
SAM Lucy's was Paul. INT. RANDY AND BILL'S BEDROOM - 2 A.M.

PETE CARSON tosses restlessly in bed, the sheets half-covering him. Next to him his wife, MIRANDA KNOLL, snores contentedly. 
Carson is in his late thirties, outdoorsy, with a tight, muscular build. Emotionally he's tightly-wound as well. 
Miranda is 35, raven-haired, sensible, pretty. She believes above all else that one should never raise one's voice. 
Carson groans... he's DREAMING... 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  BEVERLY DRIVE - (CARSON'S DREAM) - DAY 
Quick, SILENT IMAGES: A street cordoned off with police tape. Cops, SWAT teams, FBI surround BEVERLY THRIFT, a bank. 
Carson, younger, hair shorter, sits in an FBI COMMAND TRUCK across from the bank. Covering the mouthpiece of the phone in his hand, he's arguing with the OTHER AGENTS in the truck. 
Suddenly, a huge, fiery EXPLOSION blows out the front of the bank building. Horrified, Carson runs toward it... 
CUT TO: 
INT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - BEDROOM AND HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Carson is snapped awake by a CAR ALARM going off outside. 
CARSON Son of a bitch! 
He bolts out of bed, wearing nothing but a pair of striped bikini briefs. Miranda rolls over, sleepy, unconcerned... 
MIRANDA Pete... please... we have to be up early tomorrow. Call the police. 
CARSON Yeah, right. 
He races down the hall -- right past the house alarm keypad, its LCD reading "ARMED." 
He grabs an aluminum baseball bat from the umbrella stand. Forgetting to disarm the house alarm, he yanks the front door open. The house alarm begins SHRIEKING. 
CARSON (continuing) Shit! 
MIRANDA 
pulls the pillows over her head and sighs. 
MIRANDA Not again... 
EXT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Carson comes around to the driveway, which is illuminated by the streetlight -- 
Where two 20-ish ASSHOLES are sitting in his 1965 Mustang convertible, their presence courtesy of a huge cut they've made in the otherwise-perfect ragtop. 
Car-theft tools in a leather case between them, they're prying the ignition switch out of the dashboard. 
Asshole #1 spots Carson. He gets out of the car, wielding a crowbar. His partner keeps working. 
NEW ANGLE 
Asshole #1 lunges viciously, swiping at Carson with the crowbar, taking a piece out of his side. Carson starts BLEEDING profusely, but he's too pissed to notice. 
Carson uses his bat to take the offensive. They go at each other like combatants in a swordfight, the CLANKING of metal echoing through the neighborhood along with the screaming house and car ALARMS, and frantic neighborhood DOGS. 
Surprised at Carson's fury and strength, Asshole #1 backs onto the lawn, oblivious to the running SPRINKLERS. 
As he backs away, his shoe catches on one of the sprinkler heads. It breaks off, and a huge GEYSER of water sprays out. 
Carson holds his bat in both hands and jams the front of it into Asshole #1's breadbasket. He doubles over. 
Carson grabs Asshole #1's arm, and pulls it quickly against his raised knee. There is a SNAP and a loud howl as the arm breaks, and Carson tosses him aside. 
Seeing this, Asshole #2 gives up on the car. He takes off toward the street. Carson runs to head him off, but he's a lot faster in his Air Jordans than Carson is in his bare feet. 
WIDER 
Carson grabs the metal lid from a garbage can at the curb and FLINGS it like a huge Frisbee. It sails across the street -- 
And NAILS Asshole #2's head. He kisses the pavement, stunned. 
Carson runs up and grabs him, but he pulls out a long, sharp screwdriver and jabs at Carson with it. 
Then, blue flashing lights appear from around the corner: A WESTEC Chevy Blazer. Two uniformed GUARDS get out, and fumble with their sidearms. 
WESTEC GUARD Everybody... chill! Bikini boy! On the ground! 
Asshole #2 is still trying to gouge Carson with the screwdriver. Carson glares at the dopey Guards. 
CARSON Asshole was trying to boost my car! 
ANGLE ACROSS STREET 
Carson's fiftyish, black, next-door NEIGHBOR, wearing pajamas and a robe, comes out of his house. Carson sees him. 
CARSON Mike -- call 911! 
NEIGHBOR Been trying... (has a cordless phone) It's busy. (to Guards; re Carson) He's the good guy, you schumcks. 
The Guards seem to get it. Without warning, one takes out a TASER and ZAPS Asshole #2. Carson lets go just in time. 
CLOSER 
MIRANDA (hasn't heard a thing) Be right with you... 
As Carson dresses, we get a LOOK at their bedroom -- Miranda's nightstand has two neat stacks of periodicals on it, with Los Angeles magazine and Psychology Today on the top of them. 
Carson's nightstand is overflowing with books and magazines about other cities and states: Wonderland Washington; Magnificent Oregon; Welcome to North Carolina." 
INT./EXT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - PATIO & KITCHEN - DAY 
Miranda, dressed in a conservative skirt, jacket, black shoes, is out on the patio. Her breakfast -- a bowl of fruit and wheat germ -- sits on the patio table while she waters some sickly-looking ROSE BUSHES in a planter. 
Carson, dressed in shirt and tie, looking beat, fries a steak and three eggs in butter. He comes outside with his breakfast and a magazine article: "American Expatriates in New Zealand." 
MIRANDA (looks him over) Have you gotten any sleep lately? 
CARSON (ignores the question) Shop's gonna tow the car in -- goddamn ignition's trashed. 
MIRANDA Take mine. I'll ride in with Diane. 
Carson watches as she carefully picks the dead leaves off the rose bushes. 
CARSON You ask me, those suckers are a lost cause. 
She continues, then glances at the article Carson is reading. 
MIRANDA It's not for you. 
CARSON You mean it's not for you. 
MIRANDA I don't chase car thieves in my underwear. C'mon, you'd die of boredom if we ever sold this house and moved. 
CARSON I'd die of shock, from finding anyone dumb enough to buy the place. Even for what it's worth now. 
MIRANDA Lots of people bought at the top of the market... 
CARSON That sure cheers me right up. 
MIRANDA I don't know why we even talk about it. The city's not the problem. So we move. It wouldn't matter. What's that saying: "Wherever you go, there you are." 
Carson just looks at her. Reaching for the salt, he winces from the cut in his side. 
MIRANDA (continuing) I hope you're current on your tetanus booster. Was it worth it? 
CARSON One cut... two assholes in the hospital... Yep. 
Carson glances at his watch and gets up. 
CARSON (continuing) Well, another day of baby-sitting my favorite bunch of people... 
He grabs a Bianchi shoulder holster with a Sig-Sauer P-229, 9mm pistol, straps it on, then pulls on a blue windbreaker. Emblazoned on the back are large yellow letters: FBI. 
MIRANDA Ask for a transfer. 
CARSON They're not gonna transfer me. You know damn well why I was bumped down to guard duty... (as he's leaving) My outstanding people skills. 
Miranda tries to return to tending her roses. But instead, she sadly watches him go. 
EXT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - DAY 
A look of sorrow crosses Carson's face as he watches some YOUNG KIDS laugh and shove, getting onto a school bus. 
He then glances at his wounded Mustang, parked in the street. He spots something on the windshield: A pink parking ticket. 
The parking sign above the graffiti-stained Neighborhood Watch sign reads: Street Cleaning - Friday 8-10 AM. 
CARSON I hate this fuckin' town. 
Carson CHIRPS open Miranda's car: a red Volvo 960. 
As he pulls away, we SEE a bumper sticker on the car: a circle and slash through cartoon weapons on one side, cartoon teddy bears on the other, and "Arms Are For Hugging" in between. 
EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY 
The Driver backs the Mercedes out of the garage behind the Consulate. We notice there is ANOTHER MERCEDES parked inside. 
Mrs. Han, Sam and Joy come outside. They hear some heartfelt SWEARING: 
ANGRY VOICE (OS) Goddamn Limey overpriced piece a shit... 
THEIR POV 
In the driveway across the street, a man in a business suit has his head under the hood of a brand-new Jaguar convertible. The JAG OWNER's 15-year-old, blonde daughter, LISA, sits in the car with her schoolbooks in her lap. 
JOY 
turns to Mrs. Han: 
JOY Can we give Lisa a ride? 
INT./EXT.  MERCEDES - DAY 
It pulls into the driveway across the street. The Jag Owner is still SWEARING mightily. Lisa climbs into the Mercedes. 
LISA Hey, Joy... Sam... 
Joy rolls the window up and the SOUND of cursing disappears. 
LISA (continuing) Excellent -- I can't hear him! 
Under the Mercedes, the device Javal planted there begins to emit thick, white CS TEAR GAS. 
INT.  MERCEDES - DAY 
The GAS pours in through the ventilation system. Everyone inside starts coughing and choking uncontrollably. The Driver grabs his AMD-74 machine gun and pops the door locks. 
EXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY 
The Driver, Mrs. Han, Joy, Sam and Lisa pile out of the car. 
Jittering with excitement, fear and speed, Javal hops out of his van, holding a Benelli M-1, a semi-automatic shotgun. 
He SHOOTS the Driver in the chest. The BLAST from the shotgun muzzle, however, is unlike anything we've ever seen before: it is blindingly BRIGHT, even in broad daylight, belching a huge cluster of glowing, white-hot magnesium. 
The Driver flies back against the Mercedes, EMPTYING his machine gun into the air. The wound in his chest is full of BURNING magnesium shrapnel. 
WIDER 
The other drivers in the intersection see this and go completely nuts. Some duck for cover under their dashboards. Others peel away. A few COLLIDE with oncoming traffic. 
The Carpool Lady in the Cherokee pushes the kids down on the floor. The Fruit Vendor hides by rolling under a car. 
Sam and Joy are incapacitated by tear-gas coughing fits. Mrs. Han stumbles toward them, trying to get them to run away. Javal PUNCHES her, knocking her down. 
He turns to Lisa, surprised to see her. Sweating, he points the shotgun at her... almost pulls the trigger... then notices Mrs. Han's expression of horror and thinks the better of it. 
He spots a MOTORIST in a Ford Escort, peering cautiously over his dashboard to get a look at the action. 
Javal SHOOTS the Motorist through the windshield with another bright, searing blast of magnesium. The Motorist and the entire front of his car burst into FLAMES. 
Mrs. Han is on her knees, sobbing. Javal grabs her by the arm and pulls her to the back of the van. He opens the doors. 
JAVAL You see that I'm serious in my intention, yes? (she nods) If you cooperate, you and your children will be home for dinner tonight. 
He tightens his grip on her. She nods again, then looks at the kids. Javal shoves her, Sam, Joy and Lisa into the van. 
INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - DAY 
He grabs three pairs of handcuffs off a C-shaped bar welded on both ends to the inside of the van. He handcuffs one of Mrs. Han's arms, passes the chain through the bar, then handcuffs the other. He does the same with Sam; then handcuffs one of Joy's arms, passes the chain through and attaches the other handcuff to Lisa. 
Javal hops in his seat and drives away on Washington. 
EXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY 
Several people, including the Carpool Lady, rush over to the Driver, who lies DEAD and SMOLDERING on the ground. 
His hand is halfway inside his bloody pants pocket, holding a small plastic card with the Consulate's phone number on it. 
EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY 
Colonel Lee and a North Korean Army OFFICER come running out. ANOTHER OFFICER starts up a car in the back of the house. 
INT.  FBI GUARDHOUSE - NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY 
Robbins and Sabatini see the commotion and go to investigate. Dave follows. 
EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY 
Ambassador Han runs out. He has a stricken look on his face. 
COLONEL LEE (Korean; to Ambassador Han) [You must stay here.] 
Ambassador Han nods. The FBI agents run up. To them: 
AMBASSADOR HAN Someone took my family! 
The agents look at each other -- holy shit! Colonel Lee's car SCREECHES to a stop. Sabatini stands in front of it. 
SABATINI You got no jurisdiction outside this property! 
Colonel Lee shoves a big, ugly Tokorev 7.62x25mm-caliber pistol in her face as he's opening the car door. 
SABATINI (continuing) Shit! (to Ambassador Han) Yank his fuckin' leash! 
AMBASSADOR HAN My men are going! 
Colonel Lee jumps into the car and it screeches away, almost running Sabatini over. 
AMBASSADOR HAN (continuing; to Sabatini) It's a white telephone van, driving west on Washington Boulevard. 
The agents rush back to their guardhouse. Dave's government Dodge is blocking theirs. 
ROBBINS Keys! 
Dave tosses them to Robbins. Sabatini shoves Dave into the back seat. He looks at her, dumbfounded. 
SABATINI You're ridin' shotgun. 
INT.  DAVE'S DODGE - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY 
Dave is thrown against the back of the seat by the ACCELERATION. 
ROBBINS Cherry? 
DAVE Under the seat. 
Sabatini grabs the red flashing light, puts it on the dashboard. 
Carson tries to approach Javal without drawing his attention. 
INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY 
He still drives at the same speed as the surrounding traffic. 
HIS POV 
As Carson nonchalantly passes, Javal NOTICES the government- issue two-way radio sitting on the seat of Carson's Volvo. 
JAVAL 
grins... it's show-time. He STOMPS on the gas. 
INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY 
Pissed that he's been made, Carson speeds up. 
INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY 
Driving fast, Javal makes a hard right. As the van leans with the turn, something rolls out from under a sheet of canvas on the floor -- the Governess' BODY, bloodied and grotesque under the plastic tarp it's wrapped in. 
Joy starts SCREAMING, as does everyone else when they see it. 
Javal pulls out a Beretta Centurion 9mm pistol and FIRES a deafening round through the roof of the van. 
JAVAL I need to concentrate! 
EXT.  WASHINGTON BLVD - DAY 
During a lull in traffic, a WELL-DRESSED WOMAN jaywalks across the street. An LAPD black-and-white changes lanes and puts on its flashing lights. As two COPS write her a ticket... 
Around the corner TWO MEN make a quick exchange of money and a vial of crack. 
NEW ANGLE 
The Cops do notice Javal speeding by, with Carson's Volvo, the FBI Dodge and Colonel Lee's car in hot pursuit. They shove the ticket in the Well-Dressed Woman's hand and hop in their car. 
EXT.  LA CIENEGA BLVD / SIDE STREETS - DAY 
Javal turns onto the side streets -- rows of run-down apartment buildings. He takes a circuitous route, gaining a one-block lead on Carson and the others. 
Then, he makes a sudden turn into a one-way alley. 
INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY 
Javal hits a remote garage door opener. Ahead, rickety doors on one of a line of detached garages facing the alley OPEN up. 
Across from the garage, parked parallel against the back of an empty building, we notice a duplicate van. It's facing the same direction as Javal is driving. 
Javal slams on the brakes, stopping just past the garage, and then quickly backs up into the garage. 
INT.  ALLEYWAY GARAGE / JAVAL'S VAN - DAY 
As he pulls in, we catch GLIMPSES of the van slipping backwards into a FIBERGLASS SUPERSTRUCTURE that fits tightly around the rear two-thirds of it. As the van comes to a stop, several snap- buckles on the edge of the superstructure spring closed. 
Javal reaches out the van window and pulls on a rope hanging from the ceiling of the garage. The rope releases the door from the opening mechanism, so it immediately falls CLOSED. 
Then, Javal turns several switches on another of his neatly- constructed remotes: 
INT.  DUPLICATE VAN - SERIES OF SHOTS - DAY 
Steel straps are holding the steering wheel rigid. 
A set of relays, triggered remotely, start the engine; 
Engage the transmission; 
And supply fuel to the carburetor. 
EXT.  ALLEYWAYS 
The duplicate van takes off down the alley. Just as it gets up to speed, Carson and the others round the corner into the alley behind it. As far as they know, they're still chasing Javal. 
The alley is several blocks long, running parallel to the main road, separated at each block by perpendicular streets. The duplicate van races along, scraping against parked cars and the rear walls of buildings... 
INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY 
CARSON (into radio) He's gonna wrap it around something! 
EXT.  ALLEYWAYS - DAY 
Indeed, as the duplicate van crosses a street, cars swerve to avoid hitting it. It continues into the next alley. 
Up ahead, a garbage truck lumbers into the far end of the alley, its metal lift-rods extended to pick up a dumpster. 
CARSON (OS) Oh, shit... 
The duplicate van CRASHES into the garbage truck and EXPLODES. 
NEW ANGLE 
Carson, horrified, jumps out of his car. Robbins and Sabatini run up. They have to hold Carson away from the burning van. Dave hurries to the back of a building and gets sick. 
Colonel Lee, wide-eyed with anger, gets in Carson's face. 
COLONEL LEE You should not have interfered! 
WALTHER Carson? (Carson nods) Walther. Who told the Ambassador? 
CARSON His Security Chief. (beat) There was a civilian with them -- fifteen-year-old girl from across the street. We're trying to reach the parents. 
WALTHER Goddamn it... (sotto) Look, Mrs. Han was the North Korean Premier's niece! We're hearing rumors they're gonna make a major issue out of what happened here... 
INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - HALLWAY - DAY 
Carson and Walther come into the house. We hear only the TICKING of the grandfather clock in the foyer. 
Colonel Lee and his Officers stand by the stairs; Robbins, Sabatini and Dave stand together near the front door. 
CARSON I'm not so sure what happened here. Something smells. Asshole was acting like he wanted us to spot him... 
WALTHER What the hell are you talking about? 
AMBASSADOR HAN (OS) Mr. Walther? 
Ambassador Han comes down the stairs, his face tight with repressed emotion. 
WALTHER Ambassador Han... my deepest -- 
AMBASSADOR HAN -- I have no wish for condolences. Just answers. 
WALTHER As soon as we have any to give... 
Suddenly, the Butler sprints across the foyer. He shoves the cordless phone into Ambassador Han's hands. 
Ambassador Han listens to the phone, then takes in a sharp breath and sits on the steps. 
AMBASSADOR HAN (into phone) Yoon..?! 
CARSON (to FBI agents) Start a trace! 
Carson is elated. Robbins, Sabatini and Dave rush out. Walther pulls out a cell phone and hits a speed-dial key. 
WALTHER (into phone) Mr. Secretary... they're alive! 
COLONEL LEE (to Carson; incensed) You are tapping our phones?! 
CARSON (while crossing to Ambassador Han) Yeah, you didn't know. And I'm Meryl Streep. 
INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY 
Javal is holding his cell phone next to Mrs. Han's face. 
MRS. HAN (into phone) We are not hurt. But this man is very serious -- 
He pulls the phone from her, takes a breath to compose himself. 
JAVAL (into phone) I want you to remember the feeling you had when you thought your family was dead, and use it to inform the choices you're about to make. 
INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - HALLWAY - DAY 
CARSON Say you want to talk to the kids... 
AMBASSADOR HAN (into phone) I need to know my children are all right. 
JAVAL (VO) (thru phone) Be in front of a television in two minutes. Tune it to channel four. You'll get the picture. 
Javal hangs up. Stunned, Ambassador Han stands up. 
AMBASSADOR HAN There is a television in my office. 
As Carson, Ambassador Han, Colonel Lee and Walther hurry to the office in the back of the house, Carson's radio crackles: 
ROBBINS (VO) (thru radio) We're screwed on the trace -- he's on a cell phone. 
INT.  FBI GUARDHOUSE - NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY 
Dave and Robbins watch Sabatini work the comm console. 
DAVE Play the tape back. I might be able to pull the electronic serial number out of the subcarrier. 
CARSON (VO) (thru radio) Ask Dave if he knows how to find the phone's serial number. 
ROBBINS (smiles; into radio) Hey, great idea... 
INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY 
Ambassador Han turns on the TV to channel 4. 
ANGLE ON TV 
It's the same medical SOAP that's on at the apartment -- a DOCTOR and NURSE are screwing in a deserted operating room. 
INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY 
Javal is standing in the kitchenette, pointing a DIGITAL STILL CAMERA at the family. It FLASHES as he takes a picture. 
CLOSER 
There is a cable running from Javal's computer to his cell phone. He hooks another cable to the digital camera, and an IMAGE appears on the screen of his laptop. He clicks on "SEND." 
INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY 
Everyone stares expectantly at the TV. They turn as the fax machine on the credenza RINGS. An IMAGE begins to emerge from the machine: the picture from Javal's digital camera. 
COLONEL LEE The hostages are citizens of the People's Republic of Korea -- 
CARSON -- Hey, do I go to the torture chambers in your prisons, tell you how to do your job? 
WALTHER All right, you're outta here! Is this the same insubordinate crap you pulled at Beverly Thrift? 
Carson glares coldly at Walther. 
CARSON I'll coordinate the drop. 
AMBASSADOR HAN Perhaps that is better. Inspector Carson knows the terrain -- 
COLONEL LEE -- Then he can come with me. 
Walther looks at Miranda. She nods her assent. 
WALTHER (firm; to Carson) It's settled. 
CARSON It sucks. 
MIRANDA But it means we can get on with it. 
The Americans leave the room. 
INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - HALLWAY - DAY 
Still fuming, Carson walks ahead. Miranda pulls Walther aside. 
MIRANDA (sotto) Get one thing straight, Mr. Walther. If the Bureau had listened to Pete, Beverly Thrift never would've happened. 
INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY 
Hands shaking with nerve- and speed-induced jitters, Javal turns two switches on the unit atop the TV. Two LED readouts light up: one shows the current time -- 2:30 PM -- the other is fixed at 5:00 PM. Below, the TV is still on. 
Javal flips the channels, stopping at a rerun of "Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous." He suppresses a gleeful giggle. 
JAVAL That's more like it... 
He checks the contents of his prescription bottle. Two pills. He takes one, stuffs the bottle in his pocket, and leaves. 
EXT.  PíY³NGYANG, NORTH KOREA - DAY 
SUPER: PíyÚngyang. Capitol of North Korea. 
Poster city for the charms of Communism: dreary, crumbling, gray, stifling, hopeless. 
INT.  WORKERS' PARADISE HALL - CONFERENCE CHAMBER - DAY 
In the main government offices, a meeting of ten overly- decorated MILITARY MEN and their SUPPORT STAFFS. 
Sour GENERAL KAI (50's) is ARGUING heatedly in KOREAN with an aged MODERATE GENERAL. The weak-willed PREMIER OF NORTH KOREA sits up front and listens passively. 
An ARMY MAJOR sitting behind General Kai stands and slips out the door. 
EXT.  WORKERS' PARADISE HALL - ROOFTOP - DAY 
Crouched behind an air-conditioning unit, the Major, an American Operative, speaks in UNACCENTED ENGLISH into a small UPLINK DEVICE, disguised to look like a palmtop computer. 
OPERATIVE (into uplink device) ...They've got the Premier agreeing to the hard-line position -- 
He hears footsteps approaching (OS). 
OPERATIVE (continuing; sotto) More to follow... 
He angles skyward a tiny dish-shaped antenna on the Device. On its screen it says COMPRESSING... SCRAMBLING... UPLINKING... 
After it's finished, the Operative snaps it closed and puts it into a false bottom in his attachÈ case. He disappears just before a GUARD rounds the corner. 
EXT.  STREETS OF LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY 
"Welcome Pacific Partners" banners hang everywhere. 
WORKERS and CATERERS prepare for the various parties and events around town. COPS and PRIVATE SECURITY do their best to keep traffic moving, but it's already getting congested. 
INT.  FBI GUARDHOUSE - NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY 
Dave stares at his computer, looking through a DATABASE of kidnappers and their modus operandi. He rubs his eyes. 
DAVE I wanted to be home by now, take the kids to the rally in Boyle Heights. 
SABATINI We got a cabin in Big Bear. By now, L.A. was supposed to be a brown blotch in the rear-view mirror. 
She's helping Walther stack packs of THOUSAND-DOLLAR-BILLS into a series of small plastic bags, tying each one off when it's the size of a brick. They then put the individual bags into two larger bags. 
Robbins rubber-bands a matchbook-sized HOMING TRANSMITTER in between two packs of cash. He then hollows out a dime-sized space inside a different pack of money with a razor knife. 
He puts a tiny, SECOND homing transmitter in the space. Carson checks some hand-held receivers. Miranda crosses to him. 
MIRANDA He'll expect a homing device -- 
CARSON -- I expect him to expect it. He'll check the cash with an RF detector... (re larger transmitter) Meaning he'll find this one. (re smaller transmitter) This only has a quarter-mile range, but on a frequency too low to detect. (turns off receiver) And I doubt the asshole will have an X-ray machine or a metal detector. 
MIRANDA Why must you always refer generically to criminals as "assholes?" 
CARSON Gosh, you're right. It could undermine their self-esteem and spoil their chances for rehabilitation. 
MIRANDA You been reading my magazines in the bathroom again? 
as he reaches the summit. He sees Javal's motorcycle, abandoned, lying on its side... 
And then he sees the Gardener, sprawled on the ground, a BULLET HOLE in the center of his forehead. 
Carson turns off his motorcycle and pulls out his Sig 9mm. He moves slowly toward the elevator tower and looks inside. 
HIS POV 
The casement window in the back of the tower is broken. One end of the gardener's hose is tied to a grate, and the hose is hanging through the broken window. 
Carson looks out the window as Javal climbs down the outside of the tower on the hose to High Tower Drive, the street below. 
CARSON (into radio) He's on foot, at the base of the elevator tower! 
But just as Carson is about to climb down the hose... 
EXT.  HIGH TOWER DRIVE - DAY 
Javal spots a COLLEGE GIRL backing a tiny Geo out of her garage. He rips her out of the car, jumps in and tears away. 
EXT.  ALTA LOMA TERRACE - DAY 
Carson jumps back on his motorcycle and starts it up. 
CARSON (into radio) Goddammit! He's in a blue Geo! 
EXT.  HIGHLAND AVENUE - DAY 
In the Geo, Javal drives out onto Highland. He muscles his way through traffic, then cuts across to Franklin. 
Behind him, Robbins and Walther drive along the divider lane. 
On the bike, Carson emerges from Alta Loma, joining Sabatini and Dave in Dave's Dodge and Colonel Lee in the Mercedes as they all try to catch up to Javal. 
The helicopter flies ahead, then disappears past the hill below Franklin. 
EXT.  VINE STREET - DAY 
Javal hangs a hard right off of Franklin onto Vine, putting him on top of a hill that drops down to Sunset. 
Carson and Colonel Lee close in on the Geo. 
Suddenly, the helicopter RISES UP from the bottom of the hill. It's less than fifty feet in front of Javal, at eye level. 
Javal FIRES at the copter with his Beretta. 
Colonel Lee indiscriminately FIRES his machine gun at the Geo. 
Carson SHOUTS at Colonel Lee, furious at his carelessness! 
INT.  PURSUIT COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY 
Colonel Lee's BULLETS trace across the cockpit of the helicopter; one hits the PILOT in the neck. Clutching it with one hand, the Pilot loses control of the copter. 
EXT.  VINE STREET - DAY 
Everyone on the road scatters to get out of the copter's way. It appears as though it's going to crash onto the street, then it gains altitude, GYRATING wildly just above the Geo. 
Javal tries to move away, but one of its landing runners SMASHES through the top of the windshield, WEDGING itself against the inside of the Geo's roof. 
Snared, the little Geo is LIFTED off the ground -- instantly too high for a terrified Javal to escape from it. 
INT.  PURSUIT COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY 
The wounded Pilot, barely conscious, searches for safe area to set down -- but there are cars and people everywhere. 
The Pilot wrestles his stick; his copter is almost impossible to control with the car hanging from it. He's fading... 
EXT.  VINE STREET - DAY 
The copter and Geo lurch over and past the round Capitol Records building, KNOCKING the spindle off the top of it. 
The impact further destabilizes the copter's flight. It's heading right toward the 20-story Sunset Vine Tower, at the bottom of the hill. 
INT.  JAVAL'S GEO - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY 
Javal, trapped inside, looks through the windshield as the glass and steel side of the tower looms closer. He SCREAMS. 
EXT.  SUNSET VINE TOWER - DAY 
The copter and the Geo CRASH into the side of the Tower, 12 floors up. Glass blows out in all directions; the rotor shatters; office furnishings are blown through the hole like backwash. 
The Geo hangs passenger's side down from the runner. 
CLOSER 
From the series of jerking, slipping MOVEMENTS, it is clear the copter is not going to stay where it is for long. 
The Geo's passenger side door pops open. Javal, panting with fear, jimmies his foot against the dashboard and holds the steering wheel to keep from falling out. 
ANGLE ON VEHICLES BELOW 
In the clog of traffic, cars swerve away, rapidly reverse... anything to get away from the area below the impact. 
JAVAL 
reacts to another SLIP. The big saddlebags of money on the seat start to slide toward the open door. 
Colonel Lee and Ambassador Han enter. The Espionage Agents are surprised when Carson, Miranda, Walther and Sabatini follow. Walther looks around, amazed. Carson grabs a pair of headphones. 
CARSON South Korean Consulate's just down the street -- want to take a listen? 
Colonel Lee pulls the phones away from him. 
Carson takes the page with the fingerprints from Sabatini. The Espionage Agents back away from her and Javal's hand. 
CARSON (continuing; re hand) Shitcan that thing, will you?! 
She looks around. Then, shrugging, she tosses it into a wastepaper basket. 
CARSON (continuing; to Colonel Lee) Got a digital scanner? 
COLONEL LEE Analog. 
CARSON (looks equipment over) You might want to drop a few bucks at Radio Shack and get with the decade. (into radio) Dave -- get in here. Bring your computer, a city map, and the tapes of the ransom calls. 
DAVE (VO) (thru radio) On my way... 
He's also HEARD, faintly, through the laser eavesdropping unit by the window. Carson notices, but doesn't comment. 
MIRANDA (to Colonel Lee) Colonel, you saw the perp. Describe him to the Ambassador, see if it's anyone he knows. 
Colonel Lee begrudgingly obliges. Carson dials a phone. 
CARSON (into phone) This is Carson in L.A. There's a set of prints coming over. Narrow the search criteria: Male, thirties, Caucasian... French, Belgian, Swiss, maybe Canadian. Try kidnappers and bombers first. We need an answer in fifteen minutes. 
EXT.  HOOVER BUILDING, WASHINGTON, DC - DAY 
FBI headquarters, with the Washington Monument in the b.g. 
INT.  HOOVER BUILDING - FINGERPRINT LAB - DAY 
A TECHNICIAN, wearing thick glasses, sits in front of a high- resolution computer monitor. 
FINGERPRINT TECH (into phone) That yellow air out there finally rot your brain?! It's impossible! 
CARSON (VO) (thru phone) Dazzle me. 
INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY 
Carson clicks off the phone, then, as he dials another number: 
CARSON (to Walther) We got one of the best sound guys right here in town... (into phone) Newman in Audio Analysis... 
DAVE (OS) Newman's gone. 
WIDER 
Dave comes into the room. 
DAVE He quit, couple weeks ago. Opened a bed and breakfast in Wyoming. 
Carson looks at Miranda and hangs up the phone. 
DAVE (continuing; looks around) Damn... they get HBO? I'd sure like to see the fight tonight. 
CARSON Get those tapes transferred to a sound guy. We need ambient and background analysis, the whole enchilada. 
DAVE Enchilada -- you saying that because I'm Mexican? 
CARSON No... 'cause you're fat. 
MIRANDA (picks up Javal's fax) Photo enhancement... Isn't there some amazing tech with the LAPD -- 
DAVE -- Bronsky. Transferred to Seattle PD a month ago. 
CARSON Jesus H. Christ... 
SABATINI I'd send it to Langley. Let the CIA earn their keep. 
CARSON Do it. 
Carson tosses Javal's bloody, unlabeled prescription bottle to Miranda. She looks it over, runs her finger inside, tastes the dust on her fingertip. 
MIRANDA Given his behavior, this orange residue... I'd say Desoxyn, 25 mg. Amphetamines. 
CARSON Any significance? 
MIRANDA It's consistent with the lone wolf scenario: A handful of these is pure bravery-in-a-bottle, 'til the psychosis and paranoia kick in. (beat) We could check pharmacy records, on the remote chance he got them legally... if we had a couple of weeks, that is. 
CARSON (to Sabatini) Get the Bureau on it. 
MIRANDA Forget it. It's a waste of manpower. 
CARSON Look, goddammit, you start skipping no-chance-in-hell leads, we can all quit and go to the beach right now. 
Sabatini looks at them -- which will it be? Miranda frowns and nods her okay, then spreads the L.A. map out on the table. 
CARSON (continuing) He grabbed the family at 8:30. The last certain visual we had was just before his van went into the alley on La Cienega at 8:42. He called the Consulate at 9:30. 
MIRANDA That gives him about fifty minutes to get to his location, move and secure the hostages, and activate his time bomb. 
CARSON He probably waited a while to pad the time -- he wanted us know the family was still alive... (sotto; re Koreans) ...So these crazy bastards wouldn't throw a premature shit hemorrhage, but he didn't want to call too soon, either. I say they're within 15 to 20 minutes, via surface streets, of where we last saw them. 
He draws a circle on the city map: Beverly Hills to downtown, Hollywood to Inglewood. 
DAVE Military. Cop, maybe. Shit, your average high-school student if they're so inclined. My guess is our perp used off-the-shelf equipment for everything except the C-4, and that's only slightly harder to get than crack or heroin, if you know who to ask. 
EXT.  PARKER CENTER - DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - DAY 
LAPD headquarters. 
INT.  PARKER CENTER - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY 
Everyone who can be spared, even moth-eaten SUPPORT PERSONNEL, hustle through the maze of hallways and get into waiting cars. 
EXT.  STREETS OF LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY 
From up here, it looks like the city is one big block party. Accordingly, traffic is heavy and unpleasant. 
BOBBI (VO) Please, L.A., I know we're about to have quite a party out there, but don't forget the Golden Rule on the roadways... News time is 3:59... 
INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY 
Bobbi looks into the TV camera, dripping with sincerity. 
BOBBI This is Bobbi Marchfelder, your Eye in the Sky... back to you, Brent... 
The red light on the camera goes off. Bobbi turns to the Pilot. 
BOBBI (continuing; furious) Hey, dickhead... I was backlit that entire segment! (as if to a child) Keep... the sun... to my left!! 
The Cameraman and the Pilot sigh at each other. 
BOBBI (continuing) What's new on the kidnapping rumor? 
CAMERAMAN Nada. Total news blackout. 
BOBBI Go back over the hill. 
NEWS PILOT We got the valley traffic report in fifteen -- 
BOBBI -- "Stalled vehicle! One lane closed! Sig alert..!" I'll improvise! 
She takes an industrial-sized bottle of Mylanta out of her purse. It's fitted with a water-bottle DRINKING SPOUT. She takes a huge swig and grimaces. 
BOBBI (continuing; to Cameraman) What are you lookin' at? I was the morning anchor in Houston! And I'm one break away from getting out of this stupid fuckin' whirlybird! 
INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - LOS ANGELES - DAY 
The Han family sits in their booby-trapped chairs. Joy carefully turns to her mother. 
JOY Why us? 
MRS. HAN You heard him -- for money. 
JOY What if something goes wrong? 
MRS. HAN (firmly) It won't. 
INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY 
Carson grabs his FBI blazer off the back of a chair. 
CARSON I'm going to the kidnapping site. 
MIRANDA I want to talk to the witnesses. 
Colonel Lee also heads for the door. Carson looks at him. 
CARSON Great, we'll hire a bus. 
They leave. Dave, meanwhile, paces, phone in hand. 
DAVE (into phone) ...I know it's privileged information, goddammit! Lemme talk to a supervisor... You are a supervisor... Lemme talk to your goddamn supervisor... I told you, I'm with the FBI... (to Sabatini) Cellular company says he was using a phone with a cloned number. 
SABATINI Big surprise. Have 'em send a list of the numbers called on the account. 
DAVE That's what I'm trying to get. They're saying I need a subpoena. (into phone) Don't put me on hold... Don't... (pulls phone from his ear) I'm listening to Michael fuckin' Bolton! 
SABATINI Walther! Get on the horn to Justice and deal with this! 
EXT.  PACIFIC OCEAN - ANGLE ON FISHING TRAWLER - DAY 
SUPER: Pacific Ocean. 500 miles west-northwest of Los Angeles. 
We FIND a nondescript commercial fishing vessel. Up top, some Asian "FISHERMEN" crank in and stow their nets. 
INT./EXT.  FISHING TRAWLER - DAY 
Coming closer, we see it's actually a disguised North Korean SPY VESSEL. Several MEN, working under hanging tarps, secure a 20-foot-long missile launching track to the bow. 
Two MISSILE EXPERTS install a green, cone-shaped WARHEAD of high explosives onto the nose of a 23-foot-long, short-winged CRUISE MISSILE. They wait for the CAPTAIN's orders... 
EXT.  HOLLYWOOD FREEWAY - DAY 
Robbins is in Javal's van, examining the innards of the remote- control boxes. He picks up his radio. 
ROBBINS (into radio) A lot of the components are made by the same manufacturer -- a car security company. 
CARSON (VO) (thru radio) Jump a copter to the Consulate. See if the manufacturer sells to the public. Find out what shops use their stuff; put people on the phones with a description of the perp. 
EXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY 
General Kai stands in hushed conversation with the Army Major Operative and another trusted AIDE. The PHONE buzzes; the others leave the room before General Kai picks it up. 
INT.  WORKERS' PARADISE HALL - OPERATIVE'S OFFICE - DAY 
Behind closed doors, the Operative LISTENS to the phone call with an EAVESDROPPING RECEIVER. What he hears stuns him. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  WORKERS' PARADISE HALL - ROOFTOP - DAY 
The Operative is in his hiding spot with his uplink device. 
OPERATIVE (urgently; into device) ...Missile heading to L.A. has a Kipchak Warhead! Repeat: missile is Kipchak equipped! It was switched by order of -- 
A GUNSHOT rings out (OS), and the Operative's chest EXPLODES in blood. He pitches forward... but presses the "transmit" button on the uplink device before dying. 
On screen it says UPLINKING... (without scrambling)... then another GUNSHOT destroys it. 
Angry, General Kai steps INTO FRAME and kicks the Operative over with his foot. 
INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - LOS ANGELES - DAY 
Mrs. Han and Joy sit motionless. Sam, on the other hand, is trying not to squirm. Mrs. Han looks at him, angry. 
MRS. HAN He asked you if you had to go... 
The family becomes aware of a shrill SOUND, (OS), distant at first, but growing increasingly louder... The sound-level meters all begin to creep upward... 
EXT.  APARTMENT BUILDING - CLOSE - DAY 
A team of GARDENERS has arrived on the property for their weekly mow, blow, and go. They have lawnmowers, edgers, blowers -- it's as NOISY as an aircraft carrier during takeoffs. 
INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY 
The SOUND is getting louder, and louder... 
JOY Oh, my God... 
The meters are hovering just below the red... 
SAM 
pivots his head and looks at the tiny microphone, no bigger than a pencil eraser, attached neatly to the headrest. 
He begins chewing his wad of GUM... leans in toward the microphone, his head obscuring what he's doing... 
He moves back and we see he's SEALED the front of the mic with a small piece of the gum. 
And his meter drops to zero. 
WIDER 
Sam tilts his head forward and bends his wrist upward so he can get the rest of the gum out of his mouth. Then, while keeping pressure on the armrest with his elbow, he moves his hand over to Mrs. Han. They can't quite reach each other... 
He FLICKS the piece of gum and she catches it. 
Meanwhile, the NOISE increases. The two meters peak into the red... the yellow WARNING LIGHT begins to flash... 
Mrs. Han quickly puts the gum in her mouth, bites it in half, and cautiously passes the remainder over to Joy. 
Joy puts the gum in her mouth. She tries to push it over her mic, but her hair is in the way. She shakes her head; some hair strands remain, but she covers the mic just as the Gardeners' noise reaches a CRESCENDO... 
All three sound meters sit pinned to zero. The yellow light stops flashing. 
Sam, sweating, looks at his mother and sister... and starts laughing. They join him: a celebration for a small victory. 
INT.  WHITE HOUSE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DUSK 
The clock on the wall reads 7:13, eastern time. The President, still on Air Force One, APPEARS on the VIDEO LINK. Cut the tension in the room with a knife? You'd need a chainsaw. 
PRESIDENT (thru video link) So what the hell does "Kipchak" mean? 
INTELLIGENCE OFFICER Uh, it's a code name... for weapons using the Yersinia Pestis bacillus... 
He really doesn't want to be the one telling the President about this. 
INTELLIGENCE OFFICER (continuing) Kipchaks were Asian nomads. In 1347 they attacked a Genoese fort, and catapulted infected corpses over the walls. The Genoese who survived carried the disease back to Europe... and it killed half the population. 
PRESIDENT (thru video link) Get to the goddamn point, Major. 
The Intelligence Officer looks at the CIA Chief. 
CIA CHIEF Seems the missile is armed with a warhead carrying the Pneumonic Plague. 
The President goes nuts. 
PRESIDENT (thru video link) The Black Plague?! Every time I talk to you fuckin' guys it gets worse! What happened to this "limited retaliation" shit? 
SECRETARY OF STATE The North Koreans insist the missile carries a conventional payload. They say we're trying to trick them into aborting the attack. 
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE Especially since the uplink from our Op in P'yÚngyang was unencrypted. 
CIA CHIEF We think one of the Hard-liners switched the warhead without the Premier's knowledge. But he's not about to take our word for it, and he's too weak to risk the humiliation of backing down. 
PRESIDENT (incredulous; thru video link) They use a biological weapon on American soil, they have to know we'll respond! 
SECRETARY OF STATE Maybe they don't think we got the guts. Maybe they want a war, 'cause they think they can whip us, like what happened in 'Nam. Look who we're dealing with: a teetering, outlaw regime, and inside it, some wild-ass renegades working their screwy agenda! 
CARSON Everyone shut up! (into phone) Guy on vacation, the Canadian -- 
INSTALLER #1 (VO) (thru speakerbox) -- Yeah, Javal... 
CARSON (into phone) Six foot, sandy hair, spooky eyes? 
INSTALLER #1 (VO) (thru speakerbox; laughs) Zombie Eyes! You know the man? 
Carson and Miranda look at each other. Bingo! 
CARSON (into phone) I need a full name, address, anything you got! 
INSTALLER #1 (VO) (thru speakerbox) Paul Javal... hang on, we'll look it up... This an immigration thing? Shit, he's our best installer. 
NEW ANGLE 
One of the Korean Espionage Agents answers a RINGING phone on Colonel Lee's desk, listens, then hits the hold button. 
ESPIONAGE AGENT Inspector Carson, extension 666... 
CARSON That's appropriate... (to Dave) In 30 seconds you're gonna give me Paul Javal's shoe size. 
Carson hurries over, grabs the phone. We SEE him punch the button for x666. 
CARSON (continuing; into phone) Carson... 
EXT.  FEDERAL BUILDING, WESTWOOD - ESTABLISHING - DAY 
EDWARDS (VO) Edwards, Sound Lab... 
INT.  FBI SOUND LAB - DAY 
EDWARDS, headphones around his neck, sits in front of a wall of audio analysis equipment. 
CARSON (VO) (thru phone) Whatta you got? 
EDWARDS (into phone) Ambient background sound is normal city stuff, but there's a distinct echo pattern. Your people are in or near a high-rise that's at least eight floors tall. And there are other high-rises nearby. 
CARSON (VO) (thru phone) How high up are they? 
EDWARDS (into phone) No way to extrapolate that from the sample you gave us. (refers to notes) One more thing: There's an emergency siren approaching at 17 seconds into the second call, passing the location at 33.5 seconds. 
INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY 
Carson hangs up the phone. 
CARSON Okay -- high-rises in our search area. Eight stories or higher. 
MIRANDA Downtown, Century City, Westwood corridor, Museum Row, Mid- Wilshire... North of Sunset Strip there's a few... 
CARSON Sabatini! What about that billboard? 
SABATINI Nothing yet! Everyone's left their goddamn offices already! 
CARSON (to Robbins) LAPD will have a record of all emergency vehicles running Code 3 at 9:32 AM. Get their starting point and their destination. 
MIRANDA And have them narrow their foot- searches to areas around high-rises. 
CARSON (to Dave) Where's that fuckin' address?! 
DAVE I'm still holdin'! 
Meanwhile, we hear the high-pitched whine as Dave's MODEM connects with another computer. Dave's fingers fly across the keyboard, and in a moment, a PICTURE of Javal appears: hair longer, bearded... but the eyes are unmistakable. 
DAVE (continuing) He's on our hit parade. Interpol passed us his records when he entered the country. (reads) French by birth... looks like a total scumbag. 
SABATINI Isn't that redundant? 
DAVE (reads from computer) Raised in Quebec. Moved to Europe; served some short stretches, petty shit... arrested for kidnapping, no conviction. Did four years in France for blowing bank vaults. Moved to U.S. last year. Clean since then. 
CARSON Get his Driver's License number; Social; bank accounts; charge cards; club memberships... find out what movies he rented.  Get whoever's closest to the Auto Shop to get in there, interview everybody. 
MIRANDA This sure was a ballsy move for a car-alarm installer. 
CARSON Hey, he watched the news... Everyone knows the U.S. will do anything to avoid trouble with a mad-dog country. 
They turn, noticing that Ambassador Han has overheard. 
MIRANDA Ambassador -- 
CARSON -- Quit apologizing for me! 
MIRANDA Quit giving me reasons to! 
AMBASSADOR HAN (to Carson) On occasion, my wife has been known to kick my ankle under the table. 
Miranda gives Carson a "your turn to be gracious" look. 
CARSON Sounds like her aim's a little low. 
Not exactly what Miranda was hoping for. Dave hands Carson a piece of paper. 
DAVE Address, according to the Auto Shop. 
CARSON (looks at paper) Apartment 1060! He's in a high-rise! Sabatini -- you're with us. (off Robbins' disappointed look) She's got the field experience. 
Carson and Miranda grab their jackets, then she stops. 
SABATINI (pissed) 'She's got the field experience'... To park the fuckin' car! 
EXT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - DAY 
A boxy, ten-story complex built in the sixties. 
INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - DAY 
Carson, (FBI jacket folded over his arm) Miranda, and Colonel Lee rush into the lobby. 
Carson is about to show the CONCIERGE behind the desk his i.d, but the Concierge is nervous and sweating. Carson pulls out his Sig 9mm, approaches the door behind the desk, which is ajar... He pushes it open... 
And finds himself staring at the muzzles of three M-16 rifles. 
Three SWAT TEAM members are standing there in full body armor. 
CARSON (pulls out his i.d.) Whoa... FBI..! 
They lower their weapons. 
CARSON (continuing) How the hell you get here so fast? 
SWAT TEAM #1 They're shootin' a cop movie down the street. We're workin' as extras. 
CARSON Terrific. Who else is here? 
SWAT TEAM #1 Three officers on the roof, next building over, and two in the tenth- floor hallway. 
CARSON Tell 'em to be cool. We're going up. (to Concierge) Give me your master key. 
EXT.  ADJACENT APARTMENTS - DAY 
The SWAT team SHARPSHOOTERS crouch on the roof. 
SWAT TEAM #1 (thru radio) Feds going up -- Anglo male and female; Asian male. 
INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - DAY 
Sabatini drives the Lexus in and parks it in the fire lane. 
INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - HALLWAY - DAY 
The fire door opens next to an elevator with the number "10" on it, and Carson, Miranda and Colonel Lee come out. 
Carson and Miranda creep quietly along the hallway, toward apartment 1060. Carson listens at the door, hears nothing. 
He moves to the next door down, apartment 1058, and quietly unlocks the door. 
INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - #1058 - DAY 
The shades are drawn, and the apartment is dark. 
As Carson and Miranda cut through the apartment, they realize there's a WOMAN lying in the bed. She's naked, and she's not alone. Someone is under the sheets. ANOTHER WOMAN. 
The first Woman opens her eyes, sees the intruders, and grabs for a Colt Gold Cup .45 auto in the dresser drawer. 
WOMAN What the fuck..! 
Her friend sits up. Miranda holds her finger to her lips and shows them her FBI shield. 
MIRANDA Sorry... 
Carson cranks open their window and steps out onto the foot- wide, ornamental balcony. 
CARSON (to Miranda) Wait here. 
She begins to protest. He shoots her a look that silences her. 
EXT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - DAY 
The SWAT sharpshooters watch from the next building over as Carson, ten floors up, peers through the slit in between the curtains into the window of Javal's apartment. 
He swings his legs over onto Javal's ornamental balcony... the bolts holding the rail onto the wall are loose and rusty... the balcony SLIPS a little... 
He leans on the crank-operated window until it SNAPS open. 
INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - JAVAL'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Carson steps inside. He looks around the bedroom -- it's empty. No furnishings, the closet shelves are bare, even the pictures on the walls are gone, leaving only their outline. 
Carson cautiously goes into the living room -- 
It's also empty. All that remains are a few cardboard boxes, and three flower pots in macramÈ ceiling hangers by the living room window. Some dead leaves lie on the floor beneath them. 
CARSON (into radio) I'm in. It's empty, but sit tight while I look around. 
Carson cautiously approaches the cardboard boxes. 
INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - #1058 - DAY 
The clock on the bedstand reads 4:25. Miranda smiles uncomfortably at the two naked women together in bed. 
MIRANDA I like what you've done with the place... 
INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - HALLWAY - DAY 
The elevator DINGS. Sabatini comes out, H&K MP-5 in hand. 
CARSON (into radio) Miranda..! 
MIRANDA (VO) (thru radio) I heard. I'm in the copter. 
CARSON (into radio) I want you to get out of here... 
INT.  GOVERNMENT HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY 
Miranda is flying just behind Carson's Volvo. The TRAFFIC is beyond nightmarish. She smiles at his concern for her. 
MIRANDA (into radio) Shut up and keep your eyes on the road. That's my goddamn car. (beat; into radio) Dave? You staying on top of the research? 
INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY 
Sweating, Dave is watching the ACTION outside on a TV while hurriedly bandaging Robbins' shoulder with some torn cloth. He grabs for the two-way and we realize he's panicking. 
DAVE (into radio) I can't... My kids... 
MIRANDA (VO) (thru radio; calmly) Listen: the best way to help them is to stay at your computer. If any information comes in, holler. Okay? 
He squeezes his eyes shut... After a long beat: 
DAVE (into radio) Okay... 
EXT.  SKY OVER LOS ANGELES - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY 
Several large military helicopters approach -- troop contingents from Pendleton and Ft. Irwin. 
The big CH-54 dual-rotor copters set down and offload MARINES and ARMY INFANTRY. 
Others, like Apache Gunship combat copters and Hueys, begin to follow the pursuit. They join the police and TV copters, and it looks like the Ride of the Valkyries. 
EXT.  STREETS OF LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY 
People flee from the festivities in droves. Seeing the helicopters and TROOPS in bio suits only fuels the hysteria. 
We hear news REPORTS coming from car radios, boom boxes, TV's. Reporters chatter urgently in English, Spanish, Japanese, Korean, Farsi, their voices mixing with the shouts of pedestrians, the rumbling and horn-blowing of the traffic... 
Everyone, everywhere is getting into their cars in a mad dash to get out of town or rendezvous with loved ones. 
This is the mother of all rush hours. 
EXT.  WESTERN AVENUE - DAY 
Colonel Lee's car turns right onto Western Avenue. He's in the heart of Koreatown -- hardly any of the signs are in English. 
He swerves through the panicked drivers jamming the roads -- in the center lane, or into the oncoming traffic. The cars he HITS crumple against the Mercedes without slowing it down. 
Carson's Volvo follows, squeezing through traffic in its wake. 
INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) DAY 
Bobbi is salivating with excitement (and antacid.) She snaps off her mic and yells at her Cameraman: 
BOBBI Don't lose the Benz, moron... pull back... show the other copters around us... this is fuckin' great... 
INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY 
Ambassador Han looks glumly at the chaos in the streets. 
CARSON ...The Colonel hired Javal, made it look like he was working alone. Then he made sure Javal got killed, so we'd never find your family -- and they'd have an excuse to drop their bomb. But what's in it for 'em? 
AMBASSADOR HAN There are men in my government whose power depends on North Korea staying as it is: Socialist, repressive, isolated from the world. They'll resort to anything, even war, to keep it that way. They have the Hitler Syndrome: if their country cannot exist the way they want it, they would rather see it destroyed. 
EXT.  WESTERN AVENUE - DAY 
Colonel Lee gets stuck in a line of cars trying to get onto the 10 East. Above, a swarm of HELICOPTERS circle him. 
INT.  APACHE HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY 
Marine MAJOR VREELAND and his PILOT sit in the lead helicopter, an Apache Gunship. 
INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY 
Carson leans on the HORN and tries to push through traffic. 
VREELAND (VO) (thru radio) FBI, this is Major Vreeland. Discontinue your pursuit, we're gonna box his ears from up here. 
CARSON (into radio) Negative -- his car's armored! And we need the bastard alive!! 
VREELAND (VO) (thru radio) We've got the situation in hand. 
INT.  COLONEL LEE'S MERCEDES - DAY 
Colonel Lee sees the Apache helicopter approach. He leans into the back seat, knocking the top off a long, plastic crate. 
INT.  APACHE HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY 
The SUNROOF on the Mercedes slides open. Colonel Lee's upper body pokes through the sunroof. He's holding a manportable S.A.M. -- a 3-foot-long, fiberglass rocket launcher. 
Vreeland tries to bring his machine guns to bear on Colonel Lee, but there's no time... 
VREELAND (to Pilot) Shit! Pull back! 
EXT.  COLONEL LEE'S MERCEDES - DAY 
Colonel Lee depresses the trigger on the launcher and a rolling-pin-sized rocket is EXPELLED. 
INT.  COLONEL LEE'S MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY 
Colonel Lee screeches to a stop 500 feet from the bulldozers, angling the Mercedes so the driver's door is facing them. 
EXT.  SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - DAY 
The windows on the Mercedes glide open.... 
Carson hurries to catch up to it... 
Colonel Lee FIRES a rocket at the bulldozers through the driver's side window. The BACKBLAST from the launcher vents through the passenger's side. 
The ROCKET impacts the bulldozer on the left; the EXPLOSION actually FLIPS the huge machine head over tail into the air. 
The bulldozer lands upside down on the lane divider, crushing a portion of it. 
Colonel Lee rolls up his windows and drives around the burning wreckage. 
The other drivers really give him wide berth now... 
EXT.  HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY 
Approaching downtown, Colonel Lee turns onto the 110 north. 
INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY 
Traffic moves aside for Colonel Lee's notorious Mercedes. Carson catches up to it. 
DAVE (VO) (thru radio) ...The Strela-2 needs 45 meters to arm, so stay tight on his ass. 
Carson SLAMS his Volvo into the Mercedes. Ambassador Han braces himself on the dashboard. Carson looks over at him. 
CARSON That Kraut-mobile have any weaknesses you'd like to tell me about? 
AMBASSADOR HAN I don't think so -- they said it was solid as a rock. 
CARSON (looks at his crumpled car) No shit... 
As Carson moves forward, Colonel Lee's window opens enough to allow the barrel of his AMD-74 machine gun to poke through. 
Carson shoves Ambassador Han's head down and ducks. Colonel Lee STRAFES the Volvo. 
Carson looks up just in time to see... 
A pickup truck, ahead, stalled on the shoulder. 
Carson slams on the brakes, but it's too late... The Volvo CRASHES headfirst into the back of the truck. 
The Volvo's AIRBAGS deploy, stopping Carson and Ambassador Han from plowing into the dashboard. After a beat: 
AMBASSADOR HAN (dazed) I can't believe I'm still alive... 
CARSON This were a Hyundai you wouldn't be. 
Ambassador Han looks at Carson, wondering if he's putting him on. The car is a twisted mess. Carson can't get the door open. 
EXT.  HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY 
A red and white LAFD paramedic's ambulance puts on its SIREN and hurries to the Volvo. Two PARAMEDICS jump out. 
CARSON Get me out of here... 
They pry his door open with a crowbar. Carson climbs onto the roof of his car. Grimacing from pain, he looks around. 
CARSON (continuing; into radio) Anybody see him? 
MIRANDA (VO) (thru radio) Still heading north on the 110. 
The Paramedics pry the passenger door open and help Ambassador Han out. Carson looks at the ambulance. He's getting an idea... 
CARSON (into radio) Dave... You're sure those rockets are heat-seeking? 
DAVE (VO) (thru radio) Classic IR, reflective optical system. How come? 
CARSON (into radio) Just keep working your leads... 
Carson climbs into the back of the ambulance. 
INT.  AMBULANCE - DAY 
Carson rummages through the supplies, finds what he's looking for, and (BELOW FRAME) starts stuffing them into a canvas bag. 
EXT.  SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - DAY 
Carson climbs onto the roof of the ambulance. 
CARSON (into radio) This is Carson. I need a copter. 
EXT.  HELICOPTERS - (VARIOUS ANGLES) - DAY 
Everyone in the grounded helicopters -- LAPD, National Guard, Marines, media -- react to Carson's request as if he's crazy. 
CARSON (VO) (thru radio) Something small and nimble. Anybody... come in low, from the south... I'm on an ambulance by the 9th Street exit. 
MIRANDA (VO) (thru radio) Are you out of your mind? 
INT.  NEWS COPTER - DAY 
INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

EXT.  HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY 
Avoiding coils of razor-sharp concertina wire around the sign, Miranda FIRES a tear gas canister at the Mercedes' sunroof. 
It misses, bouncing off the windshield, filling the area with white smoke. Colonel Lee keeps his eye on the copter... 
INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY 
Carson gets the new flare lit and throws it away from the copter just as Colonel Lee FIRES another rocket. 
The rocket EXPLODES a few dozen yards away. Shrapnel PEPPERS the copter, DAMAGING the rear rotor. 
Struggling to maintain control, the Pilot heads for the Sixth Street on-ramp, below the freeway, out of the line of fire. 
EXT.  HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY 
Colonel Lee spots Miranda, up on the freeway sign, loading another tear gas canister. He STRAFES the sign. 
She flattens; the BULLETS tear through the sign above her. 
The L.A. Cop rushes the Mercedes. Colonel Lee FIRES at him, hitting him across the legs. 
Colonel Lee ducks back into the Mercedes and drives away. 
VARIOUS ANGLES 
As Miranda comes down from the sign... 
Carson climbs up the embankment from Sixth Street to the 101... 
The downed L.A. Cop waves as a pair of ambulances drive up, lights flashing and sirens WAILING. 
Carson runs alongside one of the ambulances, pulling the driver's door open before it's stopped. 
The Paramedic is the one who helped him and Ambassador Han out of the Volvo. Carson yanks him out of his ambulance. 
MIRANDA Sorry... 
INT.  AMBULANCE - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY 
Carson jumps in. Miranda climbs in the passenger's side. As he peels away, Miranda smacks Carson on the head. 
MIRANDA You're completely deranged! Playing chicken with rockets! 
CARSON Well, what the hell were you doing out there? 
AMBASSADOR HAN (OS) What are both of you doing? 
Carson turns, surprised and annoyed to see Ambassador Han, his arm bandaged, lying in the cot in the back. 
CARSON Oh, for Christ's sake... Hold on! 
Lights and SIRENS going, they rush into the 110/101 interchange. 
Ahead, Colonel Lee's Mercedes is driving through the cars that are parting like the Red Sea for him. 
MIRANDA Even if we can pry him out with... (looks at her watch) Twelve minutes to go, I doubt he'll be very cooperative. 
CARSON I'll just use my outstanding people skills. 
Carson glances up at the sign showing the upcoming exit: Glendale Blvd - Echo Park. A thought is forming... 
CARSON (continuing; to Ambassador Han) That car's like a rock, right? 
EXT.  HOLLYWOOD FREEWAY - DAY 
Carson suddenly cuts to the left. When they reach the Glendale Blvd exit, he SLAMS the ambulance into the side of the Mercedes, forcing it onto the freeway off-ramp.

Shaking his head, Dave glances at his computer... 
CLOSER 
Just in time to glimpse the words "First & Last + Deposit" on one of the checks as it scrolls off the screen. 
DAVE 
fumbles to scroll back to the check. 
DAVE (into radio) Wait! One of Javal's alias accounts: check for an apartment rental! 
CARSON (VO) (thru radio) You're shittin'... Where?!

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY 
Dave, re-energized, is juggling the phone and the radio. 
DAVE (into radio) Private security's going around with PA's, and they set off the fire alarm. (into phone) Well, try callin' him again! (into radio) Manager's gone, and the Assistant can't find the key to get to the rental manifest. (into phone) Then kick the fuckin' door down! 
INT.  PARK LA BREA OFFICE - DAY 
The dense Assistant Manager, MILTON, stands in the outer office, staring at the inner office's closed door.

WESTEC GUARDS (OS) (thru car-mounted PA) Tenants -- leave your apartments at once... Take the stairs...

Carson sticks the radio in his pocket and looks at Miranda. 
CARSON "Fuck-you" pumps?? 
INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY 
The hostages can hear the WHOOPING fire alarms and the (OS) ANNOUNCEMENT. Joy looks at Mrs. Han, hopeful. 
JOY They must know we're here... 
ALL Help! 
No answer. 
EXT.  PARK LA BREA - DAY 
Police cars, military vehicles, fire trucks, etc. converge on the complex from all directions. 
Several helicopters circle the complex. One has a PA in it: 
VOICE THRU PA Han family. Show us your location... 
INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY 
The family listens, frustrated, as the HELICOPTERS circle (OS). 
Joy carefully slides her arm along the arm rest, then tries to coax something out of her pocket -- her Zippo lighter. 
JOY Mother... Sam... 
They look over at her as she lights it. After a beat, Mrs. Han understands... She hesitates, then: 
MRS. HAN Do it. 
Joy drops the lighter to the floor, then swats it with her foot to Mrs. Han. She does the same, passing it to Sam, who's sitting closest to the window. 
With one eye on the VU movement meter, Sam kicks the lighter, sliding it across the carpet toward the curtains. 
INT.  PARK LA BREA OFFICE - DAY 
Several COPS and MARINES burst into the office. Milton, the Assistant Manager, cowers as they SHOOT the lock off the door to the inner office and rush in. 
He tries to lift Mrs. Han, but the meter moves to the red. 
MIRANDA (VO) (thru radio in his pocket) How's it going in there? 
CARSON (to himself) Nag, nag, nag... 
He wraps another piece of tape around the seat, and tries again to lift her. This time it works!

INT./EXT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - INCLUDE APACHE HELICOPTER - DAY 
Time: 4:58. The Apache helicopter HOVERING outside is making an incredible racket. 
Carson is helping Joy get free of her chair. As she stands, the pieces of her hair stuck to the gum over the microphone head begin to PULL the gum away! 
Mrs. Han sees the meter heading for the red, and the yellow warning light flashing... She grabs Carson's arm. 
Carson quickly covers the mic... The meter drops to zero. 
WIDER 
The FIRE is spreading across the carpet and walls. Carson is hurrying everyone out onto the small balcony. He helps Lisa into the rescue harness. She's terrified. 
CARSON You'll be over in five seconds... 
She nods. Miranda pulls her across the cable and send the harness back. Carson turns next to Sam, but he stands back so his sister can go. 
ANGLE ON BOMB 
One minute... fifty-nine seconds... 
CARSON 
sends Sam across... the harness comes back... he straps Mrs. Han into it... 
CARSON Tell 'em I'm gonna release the hook and ride down on the line. 
He pushes her across. As soon as she's there, he gestures to the Apache Pilot to move closer so he can release the hook. 
ANGLE ON BOMB 
Thirty seconds... twenty-nine... 
THE HARNESS 
slides back across to him; Carson grabs it with one hand and tries to undo the hook buckle with the other... 
But the cable is crooked, and the buckle is JAMMED -- if he can't release it, he's stuck there! Carson tries to free the hook, but it's dug in between the concrete and the railing. 
Fifteen seconds to go... 
Carson looks over at the helicopter and waves them away. 
CARSON (shouts) Release the cable from your side! Get out of here! 
MIRANDA (shouts back) Come over the railing! Grab onto the harness!

The Apache STRAINS against the resistance of the cable... 
The entire railing around the balcony BREAKS away, with Carson HANGING on the harness next to it... 
The helicopter turns and flies away... 
EXT.  PARK LA BREA - DAY 
The bomb EXPLODES, blasting a huge hole in the tower. 
All the windows in the nearby towers and apartments IMPLODE. 
CARSON

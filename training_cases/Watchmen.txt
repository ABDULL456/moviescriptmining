INT. EDWARD BLAKE'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - EVENING 
CLOSE ON: A "Have A Nice Day" HAPPY FACE PIN. STEAM rises past the pin. We hear a KETTLE BOILING. We PULL BACK and find that the pin adorns the lapel of a ROBE worn by EDWARD BLAKE, 63, but amazingly not far from his physical prime--body chiseled, built like a truck. Handsome too, save the LONG SCAR running down the side of his face. Blake removes the kettle from the stove. He scoops some Asian tea leaves from a can, dumps them in a cup . 
INT. EDWARD BLAKE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - EVENING 
The apartment is expensive but not quite luxurious. Terrific New York view from the window. Blake lives well, if alone. He sits on the couch with his cup of, tea, puts his feet up. Hits the remote, turns the big screen TV on. The news: 
ANCHORWOMAN --addressing the United Nations today, the President expressed his concern over the increasingly intense territorial disputes in both Asia and the Middle East. CUT TO: The PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES-- 
PRESIDENT The sound of a bullet at one end of the world echoes across the ocean to the other end. Armed conflict is not self contained in its respective region--the consequences reverberate through every nation across the world and therefore must be avoided at all costs. CUT BACK TO: The Anchorwoman-- 
ANCHORWOMAN While the President's position was clear, he did not comment on whether or not he would order Dr. Manhattan into action should the situation continue to escalate. CUT TO: Stock footage of DR. MANHATTAN--a man, at least he appears to be, who has glowing blue skin. The stock footage shows Dr. Manhattan flying through the air as a MISSILE heads straight for him. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: With a wave of his hand, Dr. Manhattan stops the missile in its flight--frozen in mid-air--inches from his face. With another wave, Dr. Manhattan DETONATES the missile. Dr. Manhattan disappears in the EXPLOSION . but once the smoke clears, we see he's still there. Unscathed-- --Blake snorts at the stock footage, changes the channel-- CRASH!--The FRONT DOOR EXPLODES, splintered by a KICK; Blake jumps up, immediately at the ready-- --when we see the INTRUDER'S FEET entering. Slowly. Blake sees the Intruder's face, though we never do--we only see that he's dressed in ALL BLACK, including GLOVES and a KNIT HAT. A look of recognition comes over Blake. 
BLAKE Just a matter of time, I suppose. With sudden, blinding speed, Blake WHIPS the SAUCER from under his cup, sending it FLYING like a saw-blade. The Intruder BATS IT out of the air with even quicker reflexes, but the act buys Blake time to pull a PISTOL with a SILENCER from a hollowed out STEREO SPEAKER. He's a pro . but so is our Intruder. Before Blake can get a shot off, the Intruder is already upon him, SNATCHING the gun out of Blake's hand-- --Blake PUNCHES the Intruder in the chest plate--the Intruder drops the gun. Blake fights. Not like an old man, but like the trained killer he is. But the Intruder is much, much faster. Younger. Deadlier. He SMASHES Blake with an elbow to the head. Blake falls. BLOOD blurs his vision. The Intruder picks Blake up off the ground. Brings him to the window with the great New York view. Thirty stories up. Blake looks the Intruder in the eye . and starts laughing. Hysterical. 
BLAKE (CONT'D) I always thought I knew the punchline. But I guess the joke's on me now. He laughs. The INTRUDER seems to regard Blake a moment-- --then, with incredible strength, he LIFTS BLAKE OVER HIS HEAD AND THROWS BLAKE THROUGH THE WINDOW. Blake never makes a sound as he plummets to the sidewalk. 
EXT. STREET - EVENING 
CLOSE ON: Blake's dead body. His eyes are wide open, not in fear, but in resignation. As BLOOD starts to POOL behind his head, we move to the happy face pin Blake wore, now on the sidewalk by his neck. We slowly ZOOM IN on the pin as blood DRIPS on it . when the pin is WASHED AWAY. 
EXT. STREET - LATER (TIME CUT) 
A SHOPKEEPER has his HOSE out, spraying off the blood from the sidewalk. Blake's body is gone, a CHALK OUTLINE in its place. A COP comes running up to the Shopkeeper. 
COP 1 Hey! This is still a goddamn crime scene! 
SHOPKEEPER It's been over four hours, I got a business to run-- As they argue, we're back following the happy face pin, as the water carries it to a DRAIN-- --when someone picks the pin up. We're in this person's POV as he studies the pin for a moment before pocketing it. We never see his face. We move from his POV-- --to across the street, arriving at a NEWS STAND. People at the news stand stare at. the crime scene. At the cop still arguing with the shopkeeper, the patrol cars, the yellow tape. At the MEDICAL EXAMINER zipping up Blake's BODY BAG. Other people at the news stand ignore the scene and peruse the magazines and periodicals, most of which have inflammatory headlines regarding the tense atmosphere currently in the world--a Newsweek headline reads "War?", The New York Times: "China Moves Battleships near Taiwanese Waters," The New York Post, over a PHOTO of the President with Dr. Manhattan: "What Me Worry?" The NEWS VENDOR notices a MAN frowning at the papers. 
NEWS VENDOR (re: headlines) Depressing ain't it? 
MAN But good for business, right? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
NEWS VENDOR Yeah. Irony's a bitch. The man pays for a newspaper when A HOMELESS MAN taps the News Vendor on the shoulder. 
HOMELESS MAN The current issue of The New Frontiersman, where is it? 
NEWS VENDOR It's late this month. 
HOMELESS MAN When will it be here? 
NEWS VENDOR I dunno, pal, like I said, it's late-- We MOVE BACK ACROSS THE STREET, to Blake's apartment building, then MOVE UP the building, to the broken glass window Blake was thrown out of. We MOVE INTO THE WINDOW-- 
INT. EDWARD BLAKE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
--inside the apartment, where DET. GALLAGHER (older, jaded) and DET. FINE (street worn, but not quite cynical yet) walk through the crime scene. Fine studies the broken window. 
DET. FINE Edward Blake--63 years old, six-two, 225. A solid 225, guy was built like a linebacker. This is plate glass too, you'd have to step on the gas just to put a crack in this. Had to be a two man job. At least. You check the bedroom? 
DET. GALLAGHER Drawers were open, tossed through. Mattress flipped. 
DET. FINE Robbery? 
DET. GALLAGHER Or made to look like one. (tosses Fine an ID) Found that in the bedroom. Det. Fine studies it. It's Blake's UNITED NATIONS ID. It reads "Special Advisor, United States." 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
DET. GALLAGHER (CONT'D) You see this? He picks up a PHOTO from the floor, hands it to Fine. 
DET. GALLAGHER (CONT'D) Shaking hands with the President. 
ANCHORWOMAN This just in--masked vigilante Rorschach has assaulted a New York City police officer who was guarding a crime scene in the early morning hours. Rorschach is on the FBIs ten most wanted list for violation of the Keene Act, which banned masked heroes ten years ago. Dan and Hollis watch as an image of Rorschach flashes on screen. 
HOLLIS Well, forced all of you guys out except one. 
(BEAT) Next week? Dan nods, then leaves. 
EXT. HOLLIS MASON'S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT/EARLY MORNING 
Dan descends the stairs. He pulls up his collar against the cold and walks down an alley. A SIGN below Hollis' apartment reads: "MASON AUTO REPAIRS--Obsolete models a specialty!" 
INT. SUBWAY - LATE NIGHT/EARLY MORNING 
Dan rides the subway, lost in thought, when a group of GANG MEMBERS, wearing yellow and black BANDANAS brush past him. ONE stops. Dan's leg is out, a couple inches too far. 
GANG LEADER Move your leg. 
DAN What? 
GANG LEADER I said move, dick. Dan finally realizes what he's talking about. Dan meets his eyes, for just a moment and draws back his leg. The Gang Members snicker at Dan as they pass. 
EXT. DAN DREIBERG'S TOWNHOUSE - LATE NIGHT/EARLY MORNING 
Dan walks down the empty street to his TOWNHOUSE, digging for his keys. Then he stops, suddenly alert. His front door hangs slightly OPEN--the LOCK'S been SMASHED. There's a LIGHT on inside. Cautious, Dan enters the house. 
INT. DAN DREIBERG'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
Dan quietly approaches the light coming from his kitchen. He hears odd, metal scraping SOUNDS. 
INT. DAN'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 
Dan enters the kitchen, stunned to find-- 
DAN Rorschach. Rorschach sits at the table, mask half up, eating a cold CAN 
OF BEANS. 
RORSCHACH Hello Daniel. I helped myself to some beans. You don't mind? 
DAN No, of course not. You uh, want me to heat some up for you? 
RORSCHACH No need. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Rorschach finishes the can of beans, stands, pulls his mask back down. There's a strong familiarity between the two but at the same time, Dan is wary. 
DAN You were on the news. They say you attacked a cop. 
RORSCHACH Minor wound. Won't need hospitalization. 
DAN Other than that . How have you been keeping? 
RORSCHACH Out of prison. So far. Look at this. He tosses Blake's happy face pin onto the table. Dan picks it up, runs his fingers over the RED-BROWN SPLOTCH. 
DAN This little stain, is that bean juice or-- 
RORSCHACH Human bean juice. It belonged to the Comedian. He's dead. 
DAN The Comedian? Nervous now, Dan glances out the window. DAN (cont'd) Let's talk downstairs. 
INT. DAN'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - LATE NIGHT/EARLY MORNING 
Rorschach follows Dan to a CLOSET, at the end of the hall. Dan opens the closet, revealing an old BOOKSHELF. With some difficulty, Dan PULLS OPEN the HINGED BOOKSHELF with a RUSTY CREAK. STEEL STAIRS lead down into the dark. 
INT. DAN'S OWL-CHAMBER - NIGHT 
The two men descend into Dan's WORKSHOP--the dusty remnants of a hero's LAB; Old computers and an OWL-COSTUME, hanging in a locker. No-one has been down here for years. In the center of the space, an OVAL VEHICLE the size of a subway car is covered by a dusty TARP--the Owl-Ship. 
DAN How did it happen? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
RORSCHACH Murder. Someone threw him out a window. 
DAN Maybe it was a burglary. The killer might not have known who Blake was. 
DOUG ROTH If we could move off the subject of business for a moment, I'm curious whether the world's smartest man thinks we're headed for our next World War. Adrian stops the treadmill, towels off as he heads to Dan. 
ADRIAN Predicting stock prices isn't the same as predicting world events. I hope there isn't a war, or even a skirmish for that matter. Because Veidt Enterprises has some exciting plans, plans that will, pardon the cliche, truly make this world a better place. My team of engineers and scientists have been working with Dr. Manhattan himself on synthesizing a new, cheap form of energy which will eliminate the worlds reliance on fossil fuels with no toxic emissions. This energy could power cars, aircrafts, stadiums--there are no limitations-- (reaching Dan) 
(MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
ADRIAN (CONT'D) --but I talk too much. Will you mind pausing the interview a moment, Doug? A good friend of mine is here. Doug Roth leaves. Adrian hugs Dan, despite the sweat. 
DAN You look good, Adrian. 
ADRIAN Dan--it's been far too long. 
INT. ADRIAN VEIDT'S OFFICE - LATER 
Dan and Adrian sit, talking over coffee. Dan examines an ACTION-FIGURE of Adrian as OZYMANDIAS (his superhero alias). 
ADRIAN Rorschach. He paid me a visit too. 
DAN He did? Must've been tough to get past your security, even for him. I thought your assistant was going to take me out. 
ADRIAN 
(LAUGHS) Sara can be tough. Is that why you came to see me? You're worried about this mask killer theory Rorschach's conjured up? 
DAN You're the world's smartest man, Adrian. You tell me. 
ADRIAN Rorschach's a sociopath suffering through nostalgia. I revealed my identity to the public as soon as the Keene Act was passed. If an old enemy wanted me dead it would have been done already. Adrian notices the news on one of his TV projectors. Something about Pakistan putting troops along the Indian border. Adrian turns up the volume, looking grim. 
ADRIAN (CONT'D) No, there are other things in the world I'm far more concerned about. ON THE WALL: The TV projector shows an image of TWO PAKISTANI SOLDIERS on patrol. 
EXT. PAKISTAN/INDIA BORDER (KASHMIR) - SAME TIME 
We're now actually with the two Soldiers on patrol. One of the Soldiers takes out a pair of binoculars, looking into the mountains. (They speak in Baluchi) 
PAKISTANI SOLDIER We should attack the Indian bastards. I don't understand-- CUT TO: POV--a SNIPER SCOPE, locked in on the Pakistani soldier. 
INDIAN SOLDIER #1 (O.S.) --why I can't just pull this trigger. We see two Indian Soldiers, hidden in the mountains, one with his sniper rifle aimed. (They speak in Hindi) 
INDIAN SOLDIER #2 Because then a battle begins. Then a war. And then the Americans will send-- 
INT. BRIDGE - BATTLESHIP - CHINESE WATERS - SAME TIME 
CHINESE CAPTAIN (in Mandarin) --their blue abomination to intervene. And we don't want that. At the same time, we can't assume to know what's on the minds of our enemies. We're in Chinese waters, off the coast of Taiwan. The CHINESE CAPTAIN and his First Mate look out at the water. TAIWANESE GUNBOATS can be seen in the distance. 
INT. MISSILE CONTROL ROOM - ISRAEL - SAME TIME 
We're in the control room as an ISRAELI OFFICER and his much younger AIDE watch SATELLITE IMAGES on the giant screen. Images of potential targets. (They speak in Hebrew) 
AIDE Is Dr. Manhattan even real? 
ISRAELI OFFICER Why don't you ask the Vietnamese. Or the Iraqis? Dr. Manhattan is real. Thank god for that. 
EXT. ROCKEFELLER MILITARY BASE - EVENING 
A SIGN posted on a RAZOR-WIRE FENCE reads: ROCKEFELLER MILITARY RESEARCH CENTER. An M16-toting GUARD stands at the gate. We move into Rorschach's POV as he approaches the gate. The guard has no reaction to Rorschach-- --because Rorschach is in disguise, wearing the Army Officer's uniform he stole. Rorschach presents his ID. The Guard waves him through. 
INT. HALLWAY - DR. MANHATTAN'S COMPOUND - EVENING 
Rorschach ditches the uniform in the trash and puts his mask on. He quietly enters-- 
INT. LABORATORY - CONTINUOUS 
--a huge room, which contains technologically advanced MILITARY DEVICES. Distorted in sections of GLASS, we see the REFLECTION of a HUGE MAN, GLOWING BRIGHT BLUE-- 
DR. MANHATTAN (O.S.) Good evening, Rorschach. --and we see DR. MANHATTAN (formerly Jon Osterman) for the very first time. He is SIXTY FEET TALL, BLUE LIGHT ripples from his skin, emanating pure power--he is God on earth. He works on a reactor--telekinetically moving parts in the air-- not even looking at Rorschach. It's as if Dr. Manhattan already knew he was coming. 
RORSCHACH Dr. Manhattan. Dr. Manhattan continues about his business when his girlfriend, LAURIE JUPITER, 30, very much in her prime, enters from the other end. 
LAURIE Jon, did you say some--Rorschach: What are you doing here? You're a wanted man. 
RORSCHACH Nice to see you too, Silk Spectre. 
LAURIE Don't call me that. My mother made me take that name. I always hated it. 
LAURIE More war talk. I can't deal with this. I don't want to think about the future right now. 
DR. MANHATTAN There's no such thing as the "future." I've explained to you on many occasions-- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
LAURIE --that time is simultaneous. There's no past to travel back to, no future to travel forward to, everything happens all at once, our actions affect the course of time instantly, yes I know. 
(BEAT) I'm sorry, it's just a little unnerving to be with someone who can see the future, or whatever you call it. 
DR. MANHATTAN I understand your frustration, Laurie. The human mind for some reason is only capable of viewing time frame by frame. Perhaps you'd find it more comforting if you could perceive time as I do Dr. Manhattan touches her head-- 
INT. JUPITER HOUSE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK - 25 YEARS AGO) 
Laurie's childhood home. We're in Laurie's POV, as a little girl. There's arguing downstairs. Laurie goes down to investigate. She comes upon the kitchen door, ajar. She can see her PARENTS inside, arguing-- 
LAURIE (V.0.) Jon, stop! 
INT. LABORATORY - EVENING 
Back in the present, Laurie pulls away from Dr. Manhattan's touch. That memory seems to be painful for her. 
DR. MANHATTAN I didn't mean to upset you. 
LAURIE I know. I think I've been cooped up on this base for too long. Rorschach mentioned Dan Dreiberg--we haven't seen him in years. Maybe we can give him a call, see if he's available for dinner tonight. 
DR. MANHATTAN You go ahead, Laurie. I want to further investigate this interference with my vision. I find it troubling. 
INT. RECEPTION - DR. MANHATTAN'S COMPOUND - EVENING 
Laurie, dressed up and looking gorgeous, heads out when she's stopped by a SECRET SERVICE AGENT FORBES. 
AGENT FORBES Going somewhere, Miss Jupiter? 
LAURIE Out. 
AGENT FORBES I'll have a car brought around in a few minutes. 
LAURIE No, thank you. I called a cab already-- it's waiting for me outside. She tries to walk past but Agent Forbes steps in front of her. 
AGENT FORBES You look quite nice. Who are you meeting? 
LAURIE An old friend of mine. And of Dr. Manhattan's. Now step out of my way. 
AGENT FORBES Please keep in mind, Ms. Jupiter, that your boyfriend is this country's most valuable asset. You need to keep him happy. And on our side. Laurie glares at him. 
LAURIE Yes, sir. She brushes past him as she leaves. 
EXT. NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT 
We move down the beautifully lit New York city skyline, passing the Brooklyn Bridge . the Statue of Liberty and the in Towers of the World Trade Center? We hear the LAUGHTER-- 
INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
--of Dan and Laurie as they finish up their meal at this trendy restaurant. 
LAURIE You remember that crazy guy, what did he call himself . Captain Carnage! Pretended to be a supervillian just so he could get beat up all the time? 
DAN Yeah, he tried that with me once. I just walked away but he starts following me down the street in broad daylight yelling, "punish me! punish me!" 
LAURIE 
(LAUGHS) Whatever happened to him? 
DAN Uh, well, he pulled that on Rorschach and Rorschach dropped him down an elevator shaft. They look at each other, serious, then explode in laughter. 
LAURIE Sorry, sorry, that's not funny. I can't remember the last time I laughed like this. It feels good. Dan looks at her as she finishes her coffee. We can see he's smitten with her and that he probably has been for years. Laurie seems oblivious. 
DAN It's great seeing you again, Laurie. 
LAURIE Yeah, this was fun. The WAITER arrives with the check; Laurie grabs it. 
DAN You sure I can't get that? 
LAURIE Let me put my expense account to use. You can thank Uncle Sam. 
SALLY (V.0.) (CONT'D) Finally got his punchline, I guess. Poor Eddie. 
LAURIE Poor Eddie? How can you say that? After what he-- 
SALLY Laurie, you're still young. You don't understand how things change as time goes by. FUNERAL: Blake's coffin is carried past Adrian, Dan and Dr. Manhattan. 
LAURIE (V.0.) Another lesson on time passing. Y'know, you and Jon should get together and write a book on the subject. Sally reaches into a drawer and pulls out the old photo of the Watchmen, the same one with Blake and Hollis Mason in it. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
SALLY That leaves just two of the old team left. Me and Hollis Mason. She stops at Blake in the photo, regarding him. 
EXT. CEMETERY - LATE AFTERNOON 
SALLY (V.O.) Eddie was the Comedian. He always thought he'd get the last laugh. As the PRIEST speaks, we move down the row of mourners, stopping at Dr. Manhattan looking thoughtfully into Blake's 
GRAVE 
INT. BAR - SAIGON - NIGHT - (FLASHBACK - 1964) 
MATCH CUT TO: Dr. Manhattan. In the night sky, a BURST of FIREWORKS. Outside, a CROWD of Vietnamese people CHEER. 
BLAKE (O.S.) Fireworks. A young Blake sits in a derelict Saigon bar, mean drunk. His face is devoid of his trademark scar. 
BLAKE (CONT'D) You'd think this country'd had enough goddamn fireworks. If we'd've lost this war, I think it might have driven us crazy, y'know? As a country. But we didn't. Thanks to you. 
DR. MANHATTAN You sound bitter. 
BLAKE Me? I think it's hilarious. 
VIETNAMESE GIRL (O.S.) Mr. Eddie? They both turn. A pretty VIETNAMESE GIRL stands in the door. She's pregnant, just starting to show. 
BLAKE Fantastic. Just what I need. 
VIETNAMESE GIRL The war is over now. We must talk. (touching her abdomen) About this. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Blake SLAMS his glass down. He glares at her, drunk and dangerous. 
BLAKE There's nothing to talk about cuz I'm leaving. I'm gonna forget you and your horrible, sweaty little country. He turns away. Her eyes blaze with betrayal and hatred. 
VIETNAMESE GIRL No. You will remember. You will remember me and my country forever. She SMASHES a bottle. Blake turns just as the broken SHARDS SLASH HIS FACE, slicing him his jagged scar 
BLAKE You bitch! My face! He PUSHES HER into the bar and DRAWS HIS PISTOL-- 
DR. MANHATTAN Blake . don't. BLAM! Blake shoots her; the Girl SLAMS against the far wall. She drops, dead. 
DR. MANHATTAN (CONT'D) Blake. She was pregnant. You gunned her down. Blake turns on him, spitting fury. 
BLAKE That's right! And you know what? You watched me! You could've changed the gun into steam or the bullets into mercury or the bottle into snowflakes, but you didn't, did you? You're drifting outta touch, Doc--I've seen it. Don't tell me the war got to you. Blake walks off shouting "Medic!" Dr. Manhattan turns to the girl's body and regards it, curious. MATCH CUT TO: 
EXT. CEMETERY - EARLY EVENING 
Dr. Manhattan looking down at Blake's grave. We move down to 
ADRIAN 
INT. WATCHMEN HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT - (FLASHBACK 15 YEARS AGO) 
BLAKE (V.0.) This is all bullshit. Dan, fit and trim in full Nite Owl regalia, attends the meeting of the "new" Watchmen. Rorschach is there, as is a teenage Laurie, dressed in her tight spandex costume. Dr. Manhattan, his age unchanged, stands with his girlfriend JANEY SLATER, though he casts occasional glances at young Laurie . who definitely glances back. Dan also pays Laurie attention, but she is oblivious. A younger Adrian, dressed as Oxymandias, leads the meeting. 
ADRIAN What are you saying, Comedian? Blake, now in his forties, smokes a CIGAR, feet on the table, a FLASK in hand. The PAPER in his hand reads: "Arab Leaders Call Dr. Manhattan: 'America's Weapon of Satan."' 
BLAKE What I'm saying is this whole bringing back the Watchmen thing is bullshit. It didn't work twenty years ago, and it ain't gonna work just because you want to keep on playing Cowboys and Indians. 
DAN Maybe we should agree on no drinking at meetings. Look, Rorschach and I have made real headway on the gang problem by pooling our efforts. Rorschach's voice is quiet, not yet its tortured rasp. 
RORSCHACH That's true. But something like this seems too big. Too bureaucratic. 
ADRIAN Bureaucracies can be effective with the right leadership-- 
BLAKE And that would be you, right Veidt? I mean you're the "smartest guy in the world," right? 
ADRIAN It doesn't take a genius to see that the world has problems. 
DAN Who is it? 
LAURIE (O.S.) It's Laurie. 
DAN Laurie? It takes a few moments for him to open the door. 
DAN (CONT'D) Sorry, I had a new lock installed, it's a little sticky-- 
LAURIE I left Jon. 
INT. DAN'S KITCHEN - NIGHT 
Dan pours a teary eyed Laurie a glass of RED WINE. 
DAN Did, uh, the Secret Service follow you here? 
LAURIE I lost them in the subways. I think. 
DAN I'm really sorry, Laurie. 
LAURIE Living with him . Dan, you don't know what it's been like. INTERCUT TO: Dr. Manhattan, holding Laurie's BRA. Staring. 
LAURIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) The way he looks at things, like he can't remember what they are, like he doesn't really care. This world, the real world to him it's like walking through mist, and all the people are just shadows. Shadows in the fog. Dr. Manhattan lowers his head. A SHADOW FALLS OVER HIM. He looks up to see a THREE PIECE SUIT floating before him-- waiting for its wearer. 
EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
Dan and Laurie walk the streets, getting some air. 
LAURIE I hope I didn't ruin your night. 
DAN Not at all. I was just going to see Hollis for our weekly beer session. You're more than welcome to join. In fact, I insist They pass the news stand from the opening scene. The Homeless Man is arguing with the News Vendor: 
NEWS VENDOR --I told you, this month's issue still hasn't arrived yet! Why do you care about that right wing rag so much? Cuz those bastards don't give a damn about you, pal! They--hold up, here it comes. They turn as SEYMOUR, a fat slob of a man, arrives with a BUNDLE of the latest issue of "The New Frontiersman." CUT TO: Dr. Manhattan stepping THROUGH and INTO the empty, floating suit. His TIE knots itself. Dr. Manhattan looks around the empty room . sad? Again, he looks at the photo of him and Janey Slater . . then 
DISAPPEARS IN A BURST OF PARTICLES. 
EXT. STREET - SAME TIME 
Dan and Laurie turn down a darker, less populated street. 
DAN Laurie, will you please stop apologizing? I'm here for you anytime. SHADOWS trail behind them, ominous. Someone's following. 
LAURIE I know. I just find it rude when people show up at your door-- 
INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - NIGHT 
The main waiting area. People go about their jobs. The RECEPTIONIST hears a strange, electric CRACKLING 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
LAURIE (V.0.) --completely out of the blue. Suddenly, Dr. Manhattan appears in a burst of energy. The receptionist SHRIEKS. The PRODUCER looks out his office. 
PRODUCER Terrific. Dr. Manhattan arrives and no one thinks to tell me? 
RECEPTIONIST He, he just-- 
PRODUCER All geez. We don't have time for make-up. That blue is too light for television. The light from Dr. Manhattan's SKIN DARKENS to a DEEPER BLUE. 
DR. MANHATTAN Is this dark enough? 
PRODUCER Uh, yeah 
EXT. ALLEY - SAME TIME 
Dan and Laurie turn down an alley. We now see who's following them--a group of YOUNG THUGS. 
PRODUCER (V.0.) that's dark enough. 
INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - BACK STAGE - SAME TIME 
A White House PRESS AGENT escorts Dr. Manhattan to the set. 
PRESS AGENT Just another reminder that if the second Geneva Convention comes up, our official position is that talks will not resume until the Chinese agree to exclude you from the agenda. The President approved this interview because he wanted to strengthen morale at home and to gently remind the rest of the world who holds the cards. Please keep that in mind. Dr. Manhattan stands off stage, waiting. The LIGHTS come up and we're live with the glossy NEWS HOST. 
(CONTINUED) 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (5) 
ADRIAN Everyone back off! Don't you understand? He's the only thing preventing the world from chaos! 
DOUG ROTH How many other people did you do this to? Dr. Manhattan finally SNAPS-- 
DR. MANHATTAN I said LEAVE ME ALONE! Every last person BURSTS INTO PARTICLES and DISAPPEARS. Dr. Manhattan is suddenly alone. He looks stunned almost. 
EXT. ROOF - SAME TIME 
The TV audience materializes out on the roof 
EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT 
Dan and Laurie exit the quiet alley, trying to play it off. 
LAURIE I should find a hotel. God. Imagine, us getting mugged. 
DAN Why don't you come by Hollis' with me? Shake off the adrenaline. 
LAURIE No thanks, I've had enough hero stuff for one night. (walking away) You take care, Dan. It's a dangerous world out there. 
INT. HOLLIS MASON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Hollis opens the door for Dan-- 
HOLLIS You're late. 
DAN I know, you won't believe it-- 
HOLLIS You missed it--Dr. Manhattan just lost it on live TV. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
DAN Wait, what? Dan turns to the TV, which replays the clip of Dr. Manhattan being accosted and then teleporting everyone to the roof. 
DAN (CONT'D) I was just with Laurie. She doesn't know. 
HOLLIS She'll know soon enough. The whole world will know. 
INT. CAB (MOVING) - NIGHT 
Laurie rides in back, staring out at the street, calming down. The cab stops at a red light; The CABBIE takes outa ZIPPO,lights a cigarette. Laurie stares at the FLAME 
INT. WATCHMEN HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT (FLASHBACK - 15 YEARS AGO) 
like she stares at the flame here, as Adrian's display burns. Laurie glances around as everyone leaves, apologizing to Adrian. 
EXT. WATCHMEN HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT (FLASHBACK - 15 YEARS AGO) 
Outside Watchmen HQ, Dan's Owl Ship rises out of view. Rorschach skulks off into the shadows. Dr. Manhattan and Janey Slater get into a Town Car as young Laurie watches from around the corner. 
BLAKE (O.S.) Laurel? Laurel Jane? Startled, Laurie turns. Blake steps out of the shadows. 
BLAKE (CONT'D) You're Sally Jupiter's kid. 
LAURIE You're the Comedian, right? You were pretty cool in there. Blake lights a smoke, looks her over. 
BLAKE You got your mom's eyes. Even that funny little mole. 
LAURIE Got another smoke? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BLAKE She was one of the all-time champion beauties, your mom. She talk about me much? 
LAURIE No. Not really. As Blake gives her a light, Laurie touches his hand to cover the lighter from the wind. She looks up at him, sly. 
SALLY (O.S.) 
TAKE YOUR HANDS OFF HER. Laurie nearly jumps out of her skin. A younger Sally marches toward them from a LIMO, waiting at the sidewalk. 
CHAMBERÂ 
JON OSTERMAN (CONT'D) 
(YELLING) I'll catch up with you guys--I left my watch inside . Jon backs into the chamber without noticing the DIGITAL CLOCK above the doors counting down: 3 2 1--"TIME LOCK INITIATED"--the doors CLOSE . BACK TO: Dr. Manhattan on Mars as he stops to pick up a STRANGE ROCK. It's beautiful--the colors, the crystals-- unlike anything we've ever seen-- --and we FLASHBACK to Jon's lab COLLEAGUES watching in horror as Jon retrieves his WATCH, oblivious. They try to open the door, but it's no use--the time lock can't be overridden. Janey arrives, SCREAMS when she sees Jon inside. Jon turns, sees all the terrified faces staring at him. 
JON OSTERMAN (CONT'D) Janey? What's wrong? 
JANEY SLATER The time lock, Jon! As it dawns on Jon, he hears the hum of the REACTOR INITIATING, the big mechanical parts moving. Jon runs to the door, BANGS on it. 
JON OSTERMAN Janey: Oh my god! TEARS stream down Janey's face as she looks at him through the thick glass, helpless, hopeless. Inside, the chamber starts to GLOW . 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
JANEY SLATER I'm sorry, Jon, I can't-- Janey can't bear to watch--she runs out of the lab as the reactor initiates 
JON OSTERMAN 
JANEY! . and with a BLINDING FLASH--Jon and his watch are OBLITERATED to bits . BACK TO: Dr. Manhattan on Mars, as he obliterates the strange rock he was holding to bits and we FLASHBACK to the lab CAFETERIA. Janey sits at a table, crying softly, being consoled by her colleagues CUT TO: OUTSIDE THE NUCLEAR FACILITY, by the barbed wire fences, A DISEMBODIED BRAIN, A SET OF EYES, AND A SPINAL 
COLUMN MATERIALIZES . BACK TO: Dr. Manhattan on Mars, as he RISES into the air. At a thought, the RED SAND FUSES into a beautiful, PINK GLASS 
STRUCTURE-- --and we FLASHBACK to the cafeteria KITCHEN as a COOK SHRIEKS at A WALKING NETWORK OF HUMAN VEINS-- BACK TO: The pink glass structure on Mars which SPREADS OUT INTO COMPLEX GLASS PATTERNS, RISING FROM THE PLAIN at Dr. Manhattan's command-- --and we FLASHBACK to the cafeteria HALLWAY as a SKELETON passes two terrified GUARDS BACK TO: Dr. Manhattan, now dwarfed by the RISING, EVOLVING GLASS STRUCTURE, which begins to resemble parts of a WATCH-- --and we FLASHBACK to the cafeteria. Janey's still crying. One of her Colleagues reaches for her hand when STATIC SPARKS snap around them. All over the cafeteria, the METAL UTENSILS begin to SPARK. In the center of the room, GLOWING BLUE PARTICLES begin to collect, SLAMMING INTO EACH OTHER with amazing force and in a BLINDING FLASH, THE PARTICLES FORM DR. MANHATTAN, hovering over the room like a newborn god. Everyone in the cafeteria looks up in awe, in fear and-- 
JANEY SLATER Oh god . Jon is that you?

INT. ROCKEFELLER BASE - COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - NIGHT 
PULL OUT FROM: A SATELLITE IMAGE of MARS. NOISE filters back in, as TECHNICIANS buzz this way and that, desperate. 
AGENT FORBES There must be some way to contact him. Laurie sits in the room, largely forgotten. 
LAURIE Agent Forbes. 
AGENT FORBES (distracted, annoyed) What? 
LAURIE I need to go to the bathroom. Agent Forbes gives her a look, then waves for a SECRET SERVICE AGENT to escort her. 
INT. ROCKEFELLER MILITARY BASE - HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Laurie heads to the bathroom, trailed by the Secret Service Agent. As she reaches the bathroom door-- --she suddenly SPINS and ELBOWS the agent in the GROIN. The Agent buckles; Laurie grabs him by his coat, SHOVES his head through the bathroom door and SLAMS THE DOOR on his head. 
INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Laurie drags the groggy Agent into the bathroom. She takes his GUN, pulls it on him. 
LAURIE You're getting me out of here. 
SECRET SERVICE AGENT We're only detaining you for national security purposes. Don't you understand? 
LAURIE Don't you understand that sitting there with a bunch of high tech radios and monitors isn't going to bring him back? 
(MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
LAURIE (CONT'D) Only one thing can bring ion back and that's Jon. If he wants to find me, he's quite capable of doing so on his own. I've been a prisoner in my live long enough. You are taking me out of here because if you don't, and Jon does come back, I'm going to let him know who was naughty and who was nice. And he won't give you a lump of coal--he'll turn you into one, understand? The Agent eyes her, then reluctantly gets to his feet. 
INT. DAN DREIBERG'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAWN 
Dan sleeps peacefully in his bed when a SHADOW moves over Dan . dropping a NEWSPAPER on his LAP, waking Dan with a gasp. Rorschach hovers beside the bed. 
DAN Jesus! Rorschach 
RORSCHACH Good morning, Daniel. I brought in your paper. Dan reads the headline: "DR. MANHATTAN LEAVES EARTH." 
RORSCHACH (CONT'D) The Comedian murdered. Dr. Manhattan exiled. Two of us gone within a week. Who's next? Veidt? Ms. Jupiter? Me? You? Rorschach turns for the door as Dan reads the story. 
RORSCHACH (CONT'D) By the way, that new lock broke after one shove. 
RORSCHACH (CONT'D) My face! Give it back to me! Rorschach is finally beaten, surrounded by cops, as Moloch's house blazes in the background. 
RORSCHACH (CONT'D) 
GIVE ME BACK MY FACE! 
INT. DAN'S HOUSE - DAY 
Dan is at the front door, fixing the lock Rorschach busted twice, when Laurie comes down the stairs, yawning. 
LAURIE What time is it? 
DAN Noon. Thought I'd let you sleep in. Laurie smiles at him. Is Dan crazy or does he sense a spark? She touches his shoulder as she turns into the living room, then turns on the TV: 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
ANCHORWOMAN Today, police searched the apartment of Walter Kovacs, better known as the masked vigilante Rorschach. Kovacs was captured last night and charged with the murder of Edgar Jacobi, formerly known as the supervillain Moloch. Moloch was found shot in the head at point blank range. Both Dan and Laurie stop what they're doing, eyes fixed on the TV: They see Rorschach, unmasked, IN SHACKLES. 
ANCHORWOMAN (CONT'D) Inside the decrepit apartment, police discovered stacks of right-wing literature, including several years of back issues of the ultra-conservative publication, "The New Frontiersman." We asked "New Frontiersman" editor, Hector Godfrey, for comment. CUT TO: A clip of the EDITOR being interviewed. We see Seymour, who we met at the news stand, in the background. 
EDITOR Rorschach is an American patriot and we are proud that he reads this publication. 
ANCHORWOMAN During his capture, Kovacs assaulted and severely injured at least nine police officers, shooting one officer with a grappling gun. That officer is in serious but stable condition. 
ANCHORMAN Meanwhile, in Kashmir, fighting continues to intensify. Both India and Pakistan alluded that the use of nuclear weapons is not out of the question-- Laurie shuts off the TV, not wanting to hear the war talk. 
LAURIE That mask's eaten Rorschach's brains away. 
DAN He wasn't always like that. We were a great team--tactically, he was brilliant. But I don't know, something about this murder charge I just can't see Rorschach shooting Moloch. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
LAURIE He shot a cop with a grappling gun. 
DAN Don't remind me, I made that thing for him. But a regular gun just seems too . ordinary 
LAURIE And this war, god. Sometimes I wish I could just leave the planet. Like Jon. 
DAN Oh sure. The old Manhattan Transfer. 
LAURIE Now, that's funny. That's what you call Jon's teleportation? 
DAN Well, not to his face. Laurie laughs. 
INT. PRISON HALLS - DAY 
Rorschach walks, led by TWO CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS. From the cells, PRISONERS shout insults, death threats. Rorschach stares ahead. Silent. Calm. 
INT. PRISON PSYCH ROOM - DAY 
The PRISON PSYCHIATRIST, Black, amiable, a mite portly, sits across the table from Rorschach sans mask: Cold and frightening. The Psychiatrist reads his FILE. 
PSYCHIATRIST Walter Kovacs. Is that your name? Walter? 
RORSCHACH No. The Psychiatrist sits back, considering Rorschach carefully. 
PSYCHIATRIST Let me explain your situation here, Walter. If you cooperate with me, I may be able to convince them that you should to be treated medically, in a hospital, which I believe is best for you. But the authorities want to put you in General Population. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
RORSCHACH A prison is a prison. 
PSYCHIATRIST Yes, but the difference is, downstairs? They'll eat you alive. He holds up a RORSCHACH BLOT-CARD. 
PSYCHIATRIST (CONT'D) Now . . tell me what you see. FLASH OF: A DEAD DOG. Bloody, horrible. 
RORSCHACH A pretty butterfly. The Psychiatrist holds up another blot-card. 
PSYCHIATRIST How about this one? What do you see here? FLASH OF: Rorschach, as a LITTLE BOY, watching his MOTHER, HALF NAKED, EMBRACE A MAN AS HE HANDS HER SOME MONEY. When she catches Rorschach interrupting, she SMACKS him in the face. Shuts the door on him. 
RORSCHACH Some nice flowers. The Psychiatrist eyes him, dubious. Holds up another card. FLASH OF: Rorschach as a little boy looking up at TWO OLDER BOYS, teasing him. Calling him "son of a whore." Rorschach just wants to be left alone when one of the Boys SPITS in his face. Suddenly, Rorschach's face changes. He attacks the Boy like a wild animal--biting, clawing . 
PRISONER Hey, Rorschach. You're pretty famous, right? Y'know, I'm pretty famous too. Maybe I can give you my autograph. The Prisoner slides a SHIV from his sleeve 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Rorschach doesn't register this. He waits for the FRY-COOK behind the counter to turn away-- --then casually reaches across and lifts the DEEP-FRYER BASKET from its mount-- --the Prisoner JABS the shiv forward--Rorschach spins, GRIPPING the man's wrist and FLINGING the BOILING GREASE INTO THE MAN'S FACE. The man SHRIEKS like a FIRE WHISTLE and CRASHES TO THE GROUND. The Guards DESCEND on Rorschach. Rorschach is calm as he's dragged away. As the injured man's screams fall away to weak, bubbling hitches, the room once again goes silent. Rorschach eyes the fearful, hateful eyes of the room, marking each one. And in the silence he speaks, his icy voice carrying easily. 
RORSCHACH None of you understand. I'm not locked up in here with you. Rorschach is placidly dragged off INTO DARKNESS 
RORSCHACH (CONT'D) You're locked up in here with me. 
INT. DAN'S OWL-CHAMBER -.EVENING 
CLOSE ON: THE NITE-OWL UNIFORM, staring its blank, empty stare. Laurie stares back, alone down here, fascinated with the costume, the gadgets, the whole place. She wanders to the OWL-SHIP, whose tarp has been pulled back. She runs her finger through the DUST caked on the windshield. 
INT. OWL-SHIP - EVENING 
Inside the ship, Laurie pulls open a HATCH filled with ALTERNATE COSTUMES; designed for underwater work, cold conditions, heavy armor. She puts a cigarette in her mouth. 
LAURIE All these gadgets and there isn't even a dash lighter She hits a BUTTON--the lights inside go DIM. Creepy. She hits the button again to turn the lights back on but nothing 
HAPPENS 
INT. DAN'S KITCHEN - EVENING 
Dan returns home with some TAKE OUT FOOD . . when he hears Laurie SCREAM downstairs. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
DAN Laurie?! Dan BOLTS for the basement door, thoughts of the mask-killer on his mind. 
INT. DAN'S OWL-CHAMBER - EVENING 
Dan descends the stairs and sees FIRE. 
DAN 
LAURIE! Dan grabs a FIRE EXTINGUISHER. 
DAN (CONT'D) Where are you?! Dan SPRAYS the fire. Laurie stumbles from the smoke, out of the Owl-Ship. Dan's got the fire under control now. 
LAURIE I'm so sorry--I hit the wrong button. I was looking for the lighter in.there. 
DAN I don't smoke. Are you hurt? 
LAURIE I'm fine, but your ship-- 
DAN Ah, that's mostly just soot. Archie's pretty resilient. 
LAURIE Archie? 
DAN 
(EMBARRASSED) Short for Archimedes--Merlin's owl. I'm just glad you're okay. I heard you scream and well, you know, after the Comedian-- 
LAURIE Still with the mask-killer theory? Rorschach is insane. 
DAN Maybe, but the Comedian murdered; Jon exiled; Someone tries to shoot Adrian; Rorschach gets arrested. It makes me uneasy. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Dan goes to a BANK OF SWITCHES on the wall. Flicking them, the Owl-Chamber LIGHTS UP. Hidden FANS dissipate the smoke. 
LAURIE How did you ever afford all this? 
DAN My Dad was in corporate banking. He left me quite a bit. Which always surprised me. 
LAURIE How did he die? 
DAN Mugging. He was shot. As Dan cleans up, Laurie watches him, like she's seeing him for the first time. 
LAURIE You really do worry about me, don't you? 
DAN Huh? Well, yeah, of course I worry about you, I mean, we're, y'know, friends-- Laurie takes off his glasses . and KISSES him. It's what Dan's been wanting all this time . but he pulls away. 
DAN (CONT'D) Sorry, I 
LAURIE It's so beautiful 
DAN Hang on. Dan BANKS, wheeling the ship toward the VELDT BUILDING. 
DAN (CONT'D) Got to clean her up a bit. I'm sure Adrian wouldn't want to impede the course of justice. Heading straight for the building, Dan JIGS at the last moment, flying the ship THROUGH THE V-SHAPED WATERFALL in the skyscraper's center. The water washes clean the years of dust. The Owl-Ship emerges, sparkling like new. 
LAURIE Look! Below, a TENEMENT BUILDING is ENGULFED IN FLAME. Dan's jaw sets. He wheels the ship around and down. As they zoom closer, they can see people SCREAMING from the windows. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
LAURIE (CONT'D) There's children in there! 
DAN I'm putting the water cannons on the lower stories. (over the LOUDSPEAKERS) 
PLEASE REMAIN CALM. WE ARE SLOWING THE 
FIRE DOWN FROM BELOW. CALMLY MAKE YOUR 
WAY TO THE ROOF AND I'LL EXTEND A RAMP TO 
YOU. (to Laurie) Can you escort the people over? She watches him move, quick, confident. She smiles. 
LAURIE I'm on it. Nite Owl. 
EXT. TENEMENT BUILDING - NIGHT 
The ship EXTENDS AN ESCAPE RAMP with Laurie on board. The residents forget their fear of fire for a moment as they soak in the spectacle of this sexy lady on this Owl-Ship. 
LAURIE Hi. If you could all form a line, we'll have you out of here in just a moment. ATOP THE SHIP: Dan latches the steering column into its roof socket. He stands; Takes a deep, chest-expanding breath. Who has he been kidding? This is who he is. Flicking a switch OLD JAZZ plays pleasantly. 
INT. OWL-SHIP - NIGHT 
Below, the residents file on board, in a daze at their surroundings. Laurie grins at the music. 
LAURIE Anybody want coffee? 
EXT. OWL-SHIP (MOVING) - NIGHT 
FIRE rising behind, Dan wings the ship STRAIGHT INTO FRAME. 
EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
The Owl-Ship RISES, leaving a grateful CROWD behind. In the background FIRE TRUCKS are just arriving. A FIREFIGHTER looks up in time to see the Owl-Ship disappear into the clouds. 
INT. OWL-SHIP (MOVING) - NIGHT 
Dan skims the clouds like a man waking from a dream. 
LAURIE I can't believe we did that! That was actually fun 
DAN Yeah. He puts a hand on her shoulder. His eyes locked onto hers. He knows what he wants and this time he's not afraid of it He kisses her. Hard. Running her hands up his cheeks, they slide each other's masks off. Their mouths melt together. 
INT. OWL-SHIP - LATER 
Soft music plays. Dan and Laurie lie in a heap of discarded costumes. 
LAURIE It was good, wasn't it? 
DAN Yeah, saving those people from the fire. Taking Archie out Laurie swats him on the chest--that's not what she meant. Dan grins, having fun with her. 
DAN (CONT'D) It--you were unbelievable. They kiss. 
LAURIE So . what do we do next? Dan sits up, serious. Very serious. 
DAN I've been thinking about that. And I believe we have certain obligations to our fraternity. 
(BEAT) I think we should spring Rorschach. 
EXT. OWL-SHIP - CONTINUOUS 
Long beat. The ship hovers, silent in the clouds. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Adrian walks briskly to his idling COPTER, propellers loudly cutting through the air. Dan gives one last effort, shouting. 
DAN Where are you going to go? 
ADRIAN Antarctica. It takes Dan a moment to realize Adrian is serious. By then, Adrian's halfway into the helicopter. 
ADRIAN (CONT'D) Good luck, Dan. He says it sincerely. Dan watches the helicopter fly off. 
INT. PRISON CELL - NIGHT 
Dumb Thug WELDS, the lock GLOWS RED. Nearly through. Rorschach backs away from the door as Big Figure trembles in excitement. 
BIG FIGURE Hurry Lloyd! I wanna smell this sonofabitch cooking! The lock MELTS AWAY. Rorschach climbs onto his bunk as Dumb Thug enters, JABBING the electric welder at him menacingly. Rorschach drives his HEEL into the porcelain TOILET BOWL, SHATTERING IT. WATER SPILLS across the floor. Rorschach KICKS Dumb Thug in the stomach; Dumb Thug buckles, then SLIPS in the water--Dumb Thug falls, welder still in hand as he hits the water Dumb Thug's hand FUSES to the welder as ELECTRICITY SURGES THROUGH HIM. He collapses, smoking. Dead. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
RORSCHACH Hmm. Never disposed of sewage with a toilet before. Obvious, really. Big Figure looks very small and alone now 
RORSCHACH (CONT'D) Two-nothing. Your move. Panic stricken, Big Figure moves, or rather, runs. Rorschach calmly follows him out of the cell. 
INT. OWL-SHIP (MOVING) - NIGHT 
The Owl-Ship tears through the sky, the prison ahead on the horizon. Dan has his game face on; Laurie's still unsure. 
DAN You don't have to do this. I know the whole crimefighting thing wasn't necessarily your choice in life. 
LAURIE No. But this is. She moves next to him. 
LAURIE (CONT'D) But I'm not doing it for Rorschach or even for Jon. And I'm sure as hell not doing if for the Comedian. They look at each other--Dan knows who she's doing it for. The Owl-Ship is upon the prison now 
LAURIE (CONT'D) Look! They see a RIOT below--Inmates spilling out into the yard, overwhelming the Correctional Officers on the ground; TOWER GUARDS take shots at some of the Inmates; Broken glass, broken furniture parts scattered through the yard; SMOKE emits from inside the prison. 
DAN Hmm, Rorschach gets locked up in here and suddenly there's a riot. I wonder if that's a coincidence. They descend toward the hell of TEAR-GAS, FIRE and VIOLENCE. The Tower Guards, stunned at the sight of the Owl-Ship, begin SHOOTING at it. The bullets bounce right off. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
DAN (CONT'D) Put your ear-plugs in. 
EXT. PRISON YARD - NIGHT 
The ship emits a PIERCING SHRIEK. WINDOWS SHATTER. The Inmates and Guards fall to the ground in sonic agony. 
INT. OWL-SHIP (MOVING) - CONTINUOUS 
LAURIE How are we going to find Rorschach in all of this? 
DAN When he and I were partners, we each had tracking implants put under our skin so old Archie here could find us if either one of us were ever in trouble. Let's see if Rorschach kept his in. Dan turns on the GPS monitor. There's a BLIP on the screen. 
DAN (CONT'D) He's in that wing. Dan steers the ship toward the Maximum Security Wing. 9 
EXT. PRISON - MAXIMUM SECURITY WING - CONTINUOUS 
The Owl-Ship stops to a hover position. The LOWER HATCH OPENS and a LADDER extends As Laurie descends the ladder, Dan simply, joyously LEAPS OUT, his wings SNAP WIDE to GLIDE him through the air. 
INT. PRISON HALLS - NIGHT 
Fires burn in the cells. Shotguns and screams echo in the emergency lighting. Archie's Owl-Shriek is dulled here--it's quiet. Tense. Laurie and Dan turn the corner, searching. Laurie spots the BODY of a DEAD GUARD. She crouches to take his PISTOL, slips it into her waistband. 
LAURIE How do we know he's still alive? They come upon Rorschach's cell. Dan sees the SMOKING CORPSE of Dumb Thug. Sees the CUT OFF HANDS of Fat Thug, HANGING from the bars. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
DAN He's alive. 
INT. PRISON HALLS - NIGHT 
Big Figure runs, turns a corner, ducking into the BATHROOM. Rorschach sees this and walks serenely after him . when Dan and Laurie enter the far hall. 
LAURIE Is that-- 
DAN Rorschach? Rorschach! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) Dan notes TWO BLIPS on the RADAR. 
EXT. NEW YORK AIRSPACE - NIGHT 
TWO NYPD HELICOPTERS appear behind the Owl-Ship INSIDE THE OWL SHIP: Dan takes the controls. 
DAN Let's try and lose them in the city. He hits the jets, heading for the New York SKYLINE. 
EXT. MARS - NIGHT 
A red vista. Dr. Manhattan and Laurie appear atop a rise. 
DR. MANHATTAN So. What do you think? 
LAURIE J--huc? Hhhhhhh-- Laurie GRIPS her throat and TUMBLES down the hill. She rolls into Jon, waiting for her at the bottom. She CLAWS at him. 
DR. MANHATTAN Oh. Forgive me. These things sometimes slip my mind. He TOUCHES her mouth, forming a small ATMOSPHERE around her. She HEAVES in air, retching and choking at the same time. 
LAURIE Jon, you stupid bastard! Listen, you better not forget this air supply or whatever it is (looking up) Oh shit. Laurie stands up before Jon's huge GLASS PALACE. 
LAURIE (CONT'D) I'm on Mars. 
EXT. NEW YORK CITY AIRSPACE - NIGHT 
The Owl-Ship WEAVES around the buildings, trying to shake the copters . but the pilots are good, staying on its tail. The Owl-Ship shoots out of the city over the water . Dan LOOPS Archie around-- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: --and heads straight for a SUBWAY TUNNEL 
INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS 
. just clearing it. The Owl-Ship SKIMS the sides of the tunnel, SPARKS flying-- --when a SUBWAY appears. They're heading straight for it. 
DAN oh no. 
RORSCHACH Tactical error, Daniel. 
DAN I know-- They head straight for the subway-- --when the tunnel opens up-- --Dan SWERVES to the adjacent track just in time. 
EXT. NEW YORK CITY AIRSPACE - NIGHT 
The Owl-Ship emerges from the subway tunnel . when one of the NYPD copters cuts it off. 
DAN Shit. Dan accelerates, weaving Archie around the skyscrapers, the Empire State Building . but the copter's still there. Dan cuts around the UNITED NATIONS BUILDING. The copter follows the Owl-Ship around to the East River . but the Owl-Ship is nowhere to be found The copter hovers there. Baffled. 
EXT. EAST RIVER (UNDERWATER) - SAME TIME 
The Owl-Ship rests at the bottom of the river, hidden 
EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
A group of GANG MEMBERS (with the black and yellow bandanas who confronted Dan on the subway earlier in the film) walks down the block when another Gang Member catches up, running.

GANG MEMBER 1 Yo, y'all hear? Some super owl dude broke Rorschach outta prison. 
GANG LEADER Rorschach? That fool put my cousin in a

GANG LEADER Does he now 
INT. HOLLIS MASON'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Hollis sits up in bed, TV on: CNN; Grainy, shaky CLIPS of the Owl-Ship. He's on the phone, beaming. 
HOLLIS It's just like old times, Sal. Nite Owl and Silk Spectre back at it again. CUT TO: Sally Jupiter on the other end in California, watching the same footage. 
SALLY I always knew Laurie had it in her. Sorry for waking you, Hollis. 
LAURIE Agh! This is so typical of you! Do you know what a relief it is to be with somebody human, like Dan? 
DR. MANHATTAN You mean you're sleeping with Dan Dreiberg? Contemplating this, he steps to the balcony's edge. 
LAURIE But you already know . You said-- 
DR. MANHATTAN I said, often, that you were my only remaining link with the world. Now that link is shattered. Don't you see the futility of asking me to save a world that I no longer have any stake in? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
LAURIE That's ridiculous. The Earth is too important to hinge on one relationship. 
DR. MANHATTAN Not to me. My red world here means more to me than your blue one. I'll show you around if you like. The giant Glass Palace begins to RUMBLE. 
LAURIE Are you doing this? I'm not in the mood for jokes. 
DR. MANHATTAN Nor I. Believe me, I fully understand the gravity of the situation. The clockwork Glass Palace RISES HIGH INTO THE AIR 
EXT. PYRAMID INDUSTRIES - NIGHT 
The Owl-Ship approaches the large warehouse building that is Pyramid Industries. The ship lands in the alley nearby. Dan and Rorschach exit the ship. Shady neighborhood. Rorschach goes to the door which is AJAR 
INT. PYRAMID INDUSTRIES - HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Dan and Rorschach slowly make their way down, peering into ROOMS. The place looks abandoned--scattered papers, dusty file cabinets, leftover computer components 
RORSCHACH You sure this is the correct location, Daniel? 
DAN Positive. Pyramid Industries. Specializes in industrial plastics. At least they did. 
INT. PYRAMID INDUSTRIES - PROCESSING PLANT - NIGHT 
They enter the large, dark industrial section of the building. They pass huge PROCESSING VATS, CONVEYOR BELTS. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
DAN I tapped into all the databases--tax records, business registries, real estate records--trying to get a bead on who's behind Pyramid but it's a never ending paper trail. Rorschach investigates ahead when Dan catches some MOVEMENT-- --he turns his FLASHLIGHT to find a few HOMELESS PEOPLE squatting in the warehouse. Upon seeing Dan in.costume, the Homeless People run away. 
RORSCHACH Daniel. 
DAN They're harmless, Rorschach. 
RORSCHACH Daniel. Rorschach is looking down at something. Dan heads over and sees a DEAD BODY in the early stages of decomposition. He turns the body over--bullet between the eyes just like Moloch . but we recognize the corpse--it's journalist Doug Roth. 
DAN Hey, I know this man. 
RORSCHACH Yes. Doug Roth. Journalist who grilled Dr. Manhattan on national television. 
DAN No I didn't watch that interview. This was the guy who was doing a story on Adrian when I went to see him. 
RORSCHACH Hmm. Journalist set up Dr. Manhattan, was probably working to set up Veidt also. Dan stands there thinking. As if hit with an epiphany. He opens his mouth like he can't believe what he's going to say. 
DAN Rorschach. What, what if it's Adrian? 
RORSCHACH Veidt? Behind everything? Makes no sense. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: ( 2) 
DAN On the surface it doesn't, but hear me out--Adrian's the only one who could've taken on the Comedian in hand to hand combat. He's the only one with the finances to create an entire company for the sole purpose of setting up Dr. Manhattan. And Adrian was directly involved in arranging that broadcast. He probably supplied this journalist with the whole cancer list. 
RORSCHACH That doesn't explain the attempt on Veidt's life. 
DAN If we say that Adrian set that up himself, he could've had the hitman shoot his assistant first. It was a risk, but-- 
RORSCHACH But why? 
DAN I don't know. Let's go ask him. 
EXT. ANTARCTICA - NIGHT 
The endless white blanket that is Antarctica is interrupted by a SPLASH OF COLOR in the distance. As we approach, we see that the color is a BIO-DOME--a tropical RAINFOREST inside. This is part of KARNAK: Adrian Veidt's Arctic Fortress. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
ADRIAN Really, getting even this far is an admirable effort, given their limitations. Of course the ice they're skating on is slippery and thinner than it looks. Let's hope they don't overstep themselves. On the monitors, Dan takes a LASER TORCH to the door. 
ADRIAN (CONT'D) Let's hope they know when to stop. 
INT. KARNAK - DAWN 
Having burnt through the control panel, Dan pushes the huge door open. They enter the grand palace, dwarfed by its Macedonian massiveness. 
DAN 
JESUS 
(BEAT) I don't understand any of this. Adrian's a pacifist. He's never killed anyone in his life. He's a vegetarian for Christ's sake! 
RORSCHACH Hitler was a vegetarian. If you're squeamish, leave him to me. We won't get a second chance. 
INT. KARNAK - CONTROL HALL - DAWN 
Dan and Rorschach pass the wall of plasma screens into-- 
INT. DINING HALL - CONTINUOUS 
--the dining hall, where Adrian eats alone, at a long table. Though they're only a few yards away, Adrian doesn't appear to see them, hidden by some PILLARS. Dan and Rorschach signal to each other, quiet. Adrian eats-- --and Rorschach RUSHES him from behind-- --Adrian moves at the last second, grabs Rorschach's arm, ELBOWS him in the chest, spins and BACKHAND FISTS him, sending him flying back. 
ADRIAN Mind your manners. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Dan draws his PEN-LASER. 
DAN Adrian, don't make me-- Adrian picks up a GOLDEN SERVING TRAY off the table as Dan FIRES. Adrian DEFLECTS the laser with the tray-- --then DISCUS-SLINGS the tray into Dan's NOSE. Blood SPRAYS, Dan drops to his knees. Adrian turns his back on them, calm. 
ADRIAN Now. What can I do for you? 
DAN You know! You killed the Comedian! You set up Rorschach! You created Pyramid Industries, hired all those people, gave them cancer and blamed it on Jon! 
ADRIAN Yes. 
DAN Dammit Adrian, what are you trying to do? 
ADRIAN What we always intended--to improve the world. As Adrian speaks, Rorschach sneaks up behind him, with a FORK. He tries to stab Adrian in the back, but Adrian effortlessly dodges the blow, GRABS Rorschach's mask, TWISTS it, then KNEES him in the gut. Rorschach drops to the floor. Adrian starts walking out of the hall. Dan helps Rorschach up and they follow. 
ADRIAN (CONT'D) I never intended to kill the Comedian-- that was an accident. Part of his duties as a government operative was to keep track of all former masked heroes, make sure there was no rocking of the boat. He must have liked Rorschach because he allowed him to continue to exist. I had thought that the Comedian might be incompetent, but he disproved that hypothesis when he discovered what was really going on. here in Karnak--no easy task. Even my staff was unaware--I made sure to keep each department separate.

CONTINUED: (2) 
ADRIAN (CONT'D) The Comedian was appalled by my plan, but still, he understood the scope of what I was trying to accomplish. Frankly, I never thought he'd actually talk. But by the time he visited poor Moloch, he was cracking badly. So I had to kill him. 
INT. CONTROL HALL - CONTINUOUS 
As they enter the control hall, Rorschach moves to attack Adrian again when he and Dan hear a growl . the Lynx steps in between, protecting its master. 
ADRIAN After Blake, I neutralized Jon--a plan nearly a decade in the works after analyzing confidential psychological profiles which predicted his withdrawal from human existence. By then, Rorschach's mask theory, 'though erroneous, needed to be addressed, so I faked my own assassination-- 
DAN Why take that risk? What if the hitman shot you first instead of your assistant? 
ADRIAN I suppose I'd have to be fast enough to catch the bullet then, wouldn't I? Adrian smiles enigmatically. 
ADRIAN (CONT'D) After apprehending my own assassin, I shoved a cyanide capsule in his mouth, disposing of him, and soon after that, the journalist Doug Roth, tying up all the loose ends if you will. Then I knew nothing stood in the way of my triumph. 
DAN Triumph? Adrian, what are you going to do? 
ADRIAN I'm firing a beam of concentrated energy, synthesized from Dr. Manhattan himself, into the hearts of nine key regions around the globe, crossing all traditional politics and ideologies;

EXT. NEW YORK STREET - MORNING 
The smoke-filled street is silent. Then GLOWING PARTICLES COALESCE, slamming together to form Jon and Laurie, but Jon's teleportation falters, shorting out. They FALL from the air. Laurie drops roughly to her knees. 
LAURIE God Jon, what was that? Jon looks around the street. Even he is awe-struck. 
DR. MANHATTAN Interference. Cataclysmic interference. Laurie looks up and screams. THOUSANDS OF BLACK SILHOUETTES are IMPRINTED on the STREET and the WALLS. Everywhere. There is no rubble--some buildings have simply disintegrated. 
LAURIE Was it a war? It doesn't seem like-- 
DR. MANHATTAN Not a war. I .don't know what it was. Dr. Manhattan looks up into the sky, studying it. 
LAURIE Take me out of here, Jon. Please. 
DR. MANHATTAN I'm sorry. This must be very upsetting for you. I have traced the source of the Tachyon particles to Antarctica. Shall we? 
LAURIE Anywhere. Anywhere's better than here. 
INT. KARNAK - CONTROL HALL - MORNING 
PULL OUT FROM: The televisions--NEWS REPORTS from all over the world, documenting the tragic destruction caused by Dr. Manhattan. Dan turns away shaken. Rorschach boils. Adrian beams. 
DAN God. God, he 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
RORSCHACH Impersonated Dr. Manhattan. Murdered millions of people. (re: Lynx) Call off your cat. Call off your cat and face me! 
ADRIAN Don't you understand? I've ended the war-- I've ended all wars. Because of their fear of ion, I've forced the world into everlasting peace. 
DAN By committing the biggest mass murder in history. You have no right to play God! 
ADRIAN I wasn't playing God. Just Dr. Manhattan. Suddenly there's a LOUD BEEPING in the hall. The Lynx growls. Adrian switches the monitors to the security cameras which show ion and Laurie materialize in the snow. 
ADRIAN (CONT'D) Speak of the devil. 
EXT. KARNAK - SAME TIME 
Laurie vomits in the snow. 
DR. MANHATTAN Adrian, of course. Who else would have the resources 
LAURIE Wait, this is Adrian's compound? Are you saying he's responsible for this-- Jon walks toward the building, entranced. Distracted. 
DR. MANHATTAN Yes. Yes, he killed Blake and millions of others. Excuse me, Daniel, I'm talking to Laurie ninety seconds ago 
LAURIE What, Daniel? Millions of others? Jon don't start that crap now, not here! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
DR. MANHATTAN I'm sorry. It's these tachyons. They're, muddling things up. I'd better follow him 
INSIDE In a burst, he's gone. 
INT. KARNAK - CONTROL HALL - CONTINUOUS 
Jon materializes in the hall. Adrian sprints like lightening, out of the room, followed by the Lynx. 
RORSCHACH No, don't let him escape! 
DAN Jon, stop him, he killed millions of people, who knows what else he'll do. Jon walks calmly after Adrian. 
DAN (CONT'D) Jon, are you okay? You seem drugged. 
DR. MANHATTAN Yes. Yes, he killed Blake and millions of others. Excuse me, Daniel, I'm talking to Laurie ninety seconds ago 
DAN What? Where's Laurie? 
DR. MANHATTAN I'm sorry. It's these tachyons. They're, muddling things up. I'd better follow him 
RORSCHACH Back to the Owl-Ship. Back to America. People must be told. Evil must be punished. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
DR. MANHATTAN Rorschach, you know I can't let you do that. Rorschach pauses. Dan is halfway there . Rorschach removes his mask, tears stand in his eyes. 
RORSCHACH Suddenly you've rediscovered humanity? If you had cared from the start, none of this would be necessary. None of this would have happened. So what are you waiting for? Do it. 
DAN 
NO WAIT! 
RORSCHACH 
DO IT!!!! Jon WAVES HIS HAND and BLOWS RORSCHACH APART. Dan collapses to his knees, sobbing. Jon contemplates the BURN-MARK where Rorschach stood only seconds ago, then disappears-- --reappearing across the hall where Laurie is. She is also in tears, watching all the horrible footage on the TV screens. 
DR. MANHATTAN Laurie. I'm leaving this galaxy. For one a little less complicated. 
LAURIE Leaving? I, I thought you regained an interest in human life. 
DR. MANHATTAN I have. I think maybe I'll create some. Goodbye, Laurie. He kisses her on the cheek-- 
ADRIAN Jon, I'd hoped to talk to you. I've made myself feel every death, see every innocent face I've murdered to save humanity--you understand, don't you? 
DR. MANHATTAN Without condoning or condemning, I 
UNDERSTAND And with that, he disappears. Forever. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) Across the hall, Dan recovers from mourning Rorschach. He stands, gritting his teeth. Walks toward Adrian. 
ADRIAN What's on your mind, Dan? 
DAN Your death. 
ADRIAN Really. You want to kill me? 
DAN Yeah. You might have created peace, but not at the expense of justice. You need to pay for what you've done. 
ADRIAN That doesn't sound like you, Dan. That sounds more like Rorschach. 
DAN Exactly. Adrian readies himself. Laurie breaks away from the TV screens. 
ADRIAN Only you're not Rorschach, are you now? How do you expect to succeed where he failed? 
DAN Tell you the truth, Adrian. I don't. Dan FLIES at Adrian, fighting like a madman for his life. His fighting style has changed. Dan's newfound brutality is informed by everything he's learned from Rorschach. About justice. About life. But Adrian is the best. He takes Dan's attacks apart with ease, delivering blows which would kill a man not quite so focused on his goal. In the end, he CATCHES Dan's final strike and TWISTS. Dan's arm SNAPS easily. 
LAURIE Dan! Laurie charges Adrian. With one hand, Adrian blocks her attack, grabs her by the hair and SLAMS her to floor, knocking her out. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (4) Dan falls to his knees, bloody and beaten. Out of tricks, out of time, he searches his belt for something, anything, and finds one last OWL-WING. The WINGS SNAP OUT. Desperate, he 
FLICKS IT AT ADRIAN-- Who merely SNATCHES the owl-Wing out of the air. He laughs. Prepares to finish Dan off. 
ADRIAN I have to say, I've always thought your choice of an owl was quite juvenile. 
DAN Really? I've always liked owls Adrian sees that Dan has pulled one last item from his belt. Adrian STEPS on Dan's WRIST, bones crunching. Dan's HAND falls OPEN, revealing the OWL-SHIP REMOTE. 
DAN (CONT'D) because you can never hear them coming. BEHIND ADRIAN: FLOODLIGHTS BLAZE, targeting Adrian as the OWL- SHIP CRASHES THROUGH THE WINDOW and into Adrian and Dan. Silence, but for the tinkling of GLASS falling to the floor. Dan tries to stand, but he falls, his left leg shattered. Most of Adrian has been CRUSHED under the ship. He coughs a fine blood spray. Adrian looks over to Dan, dying. 
ADRIAN I . don't regret my actions. I know in my heart . I did the right thing. 
DAN So do I. Adrian lays back, calm, accepting and dies. 
INT. OWL-SHIP - MORNING 
Dan sits painfully in the passenger seat, as Laurie tries to pilot the ship out of Adrian's bedroom. 
DAN That's it. Careful. Now, pull the stick to the left The ship RISES and TURNS awkwardly in the hall, smashing out more glass.

DISSOLVE TO: 
16   EXT - CONVENT - DAY 
Martha pulls up in her BMW outside the convent walls and gets out, cigarette in hand. A sign tangled over with creeper reads "Les Petites Soeurs de Marie Madeleine". Martha jangles a bell. After a wait she presses a buzzer. A   peephole in the door slams open and Sister Marguerite looks out. 
MARTHA Bonjour, I'm Doctor Martha Livingston, I... 
The peephole slams shut, but the door does open. Sister Marguerite glares at her. 
MARTHA (Cont.) Hello... I'm Doctor Martha Living...ston... I... 
Martha realizes it is the cigarette that is causing the trouble and hastily     grinds it underfoot. 
MARTHA (Cont.) 
Excuse me... I'm... 
Sister Marguerite eyes flick down at cigarette butt. Martha awkwardly tries to kick it away. 
MARTHA (Cont.) ...the court-appointed psychiatrist. 
Sister Marguerite gives a frosty imitation of a smile and motions for her to    come in. 
MARTHA (Cont.) Thank you. I um... I believe your Mother Superior's expecting me. 
Martha and the Sister walk up the drive to the convent. 
17   INT - WAITING ROOM - DAY 
Martha follows Sister Marguerite into a grilled waiting room. Sister moves    off, leaving Martha looking around curiously. Then the MOTHER MIRIAM arrives from behind the grilled door, sees Martha, sighs exasperatedly and enters giving Martha a slight start. 
MOTHER SUPERIOR (beaming at her own little joke) Doctor Livingston I presume? I'm Mother Miriam Ruth. You needn't call Mother if you don't wish. (shaking hands) Most people find it uncomfortable. 
MARTHA Well... I... 
MOTHER MIRIAM (carrying right on) I'm afraid the word brings up the most unpleasant connatations in this day and age... 
MARTHA Yes... I... 
MOTHER MIRIAM You can call me Sister. 
MARTHA ... Thank you. 
MOTHER MIRIAM You must have tons of questions. You may smoke if you want to. Just don't tell any of the Sisters. 
Martha sits;   Mother Miriam gets her a box of matches. 
MOTHER MIRIAM (Cont.) They wouldn't understand, especially Sister Marguerite. She'd scare the pants off Queen Elizabeth. (she lights Martha's cigarette) Besides, I miss them. 
MARTHA You were a smoker? 
MOTHER MIRIAM Two packs a day. 
MARTHA I can beat that. 
MOTHER MIRIAM Unfiltered. 
Martha inclines her head impressed. Mother Miriam sits down next to her. 
MOTHER MIRIAM (Cont.) Well, you have questions. (checks her watch) Fire away... 
MARTHA Who knew about Agnes' pregnancy? 
MOTHER MIRIAM No-one. 
Then Mother Miriam walks out. 
18   INT - WAITING ROOM - DAY 
A little later, Martha is sitting alone smoking. SISTER ANNE enters and indicates that Martha should follow her. They exit out of the grilled room and head up a steep flight of wooden stairs. Faintly the voice of a single young woman can be heard singing in Latin. 
19     INT - TOP CORRIDOR - DAY 
Martha follows Sister Anne down the hall towards the singing. They stop outside Agnes' room. Martha looks to see... 
20     INT - AGNES' ROOM - DAY 
... Agnes an almost childlike young woman singing happily, looking out the window. Then Agnes hears a slight sound and stops abruptly. She turns to see Martha standing in the doorway. 
MARTHA Hello. I'm Doctor Livingston. I've been asked to talk to you. May I? 
AGNES Yes. 
Martha moves further in the room. An ELDERLY NUN hovers outside the door. 
MARTHA You have a lovely voice. 
AGNES No I don't. 
MARTHA I just heard you. 
AGNES That wasn't me. 
MARTHA Was it Sister Marguerite? 
Agnes laughs and Martha closes the door, shutting out the old nun. 
MARTHA (Cont.) You're very pretty Agnes. 
AGNES No I'm not. 
MARTHA Hasn't anyone ever told you that before? 
AGNES Let's talk about something else. 
MARTHA What would you like to talk about. 
AGNES I don't know. 
MARTHA Anything... may I sit down? 
AGNES Yes. 
They both sit. 
MARTHA First thing that comes to your mind? 
AGNES God!    But there's nothing to say about God. 
MARTHA Second thing that comes to your mind. 
AGNES Love. 
MARTHA Have you ever loved anyone? 
AGNES Yes. 
MARTHA Who? 
AGNES Everyone. 
MARTHA Did it hurt? 
AGNES Yes. 
MARTHA Where? 
AGNES Down... there. 
MARTHA And what did you do? 
AGNES I went to my room. 
MARTHA And what happened? 
AGNES I got sicker. 
MARTHA 
And then what? 
AGNES I fell asleep. 
MARTHA In the middle of all the pain? 
AGNES Yes. 
MARTHA Where did the baby come from? 
AGNES What baby? 
MARTHA The baby they made up. 
AGNES From their heads... 
MARTHA Is that where they say it came from... ? 
AGNES No, they say it came from the waste paper basket! 
MARTHA Where'd it come from before that? 
AGNES From God. 
MARTHA After God... before the waste-paper basket. 
AGNES I... I don't understand. 
MARTHA Agnes, how are babies born? 
AGNES Don't you know? 
MARTHA Yes I do,    but I want you to... 
AGNES (very agitated) I don't understand what you're talking about... you want to talk about the baby... everybody wants 
to talk about    the baby but... I never saw the    baby so I can't talk about the baby    because... I don't believe in the    baby. 
MARTHA Then let's talk about something else... 
AGNES (standing) No... no, I'm tired of talking, I've been talking for weeks, nobody believes me when I tell them anything... nobody listens to me. 
MARTHA (also standing) Agnes... 
AGNES (opens the door) No... no, I don't want to answer any more questions. 
MARTHA Would you like to ask them? 
And her cry echoes all around and the doves fly out of the bell 
tower. 
AGNES (Cont.) (to Martha) God loves you. 
MARTHA Do you know a Marie? 
AGNES No... do you? 
MARTHA Why should I? 
AGNES I don't know. 
23   INT - MOTHER MIRIAM'S STUDY - DAY 
Mother Miriam is standing checking some papers when Martha enters. Mother Miriam seems to have entirely regained her good humour. 
MOTHER MIRIAM Well... what do you think? Is she totally bananas or merely slightly off centre... or maybe she's perfectly sane and just a very good liar. 
MARTHA What's your opinion? 
MOTHER MIRIAM I believe Agnes is different. 
MARTHA From other nuns... (laughs) Yes I... I've noticed. 
MOTHER MIRIAM From other people! (moving across the room) I believe she is not crazy, nor is she lying. 
MARTHA How could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth? 
MOTHER MIRIAM Because she's an innocent. She's a slate that's hasn't been touched except by God. 
MARTHA (lights a cigarette) 
That's ridiculous... 
MOTHER MIRIAM (moves to her desk, starts writing) In her case it isn't. She's had very little schooling. Her mother kept her home almost all the time and when her mother died Agnes came here, to us. She's never been out there Doctor. She's never seen a movie or a television show. She's never even read a book. 
MARTHA If she's so innocent, how come she murdered a child? 
MOTHER MIRIAM She didn't! This is manslaughter, not murder. She didn't consciously kill that baby. She'd lost a lot of blood. She was unconscious by the time we got to her. 
MARTHA So, someone else could have done it. 
MOTHER MIRIAM No... not in the eyes of the police. 
MARTHA And in your eyes? 
MOTHER MIRIAM I've already told you what I thought. 
MARTHA That she was unconscious, yes! So someone easily could have come in the room and killed the... 
MOTHER MIRIAM You don't really believe something like that happened do you? 
MARTHA It's possible isn't it? 
MOTHER MIRIAM Who? 
MARTHA One of the other nuns found out about the baby and... and wanted to avoid a scandal. 
Mother Miriam removes the tray from under a pot plant and bangs it down in front of Martha to act as an ashtray. 
MOTHER MIRIAM That's absurd! 
MARTHA That possibility never occurred to you? 
MARTHA I thought cherry-vanilla was your favourite. 
MAMA Not any more... now I like chocolate. 
MARTHA (stroking her hair) Did you have a good week Mama. Are they treating you all right? 
MAMA You know Martha never comes to see me. You watch it, she's going straight to hell... after all the things she said to me. Then she marries that son of a bitch of a Frenchman... has an abortion. I knew that one wouldn't work out. Not like you Marie. You got married to God. 
MARTHA (lighting up) Marie's dead Mama. 
MAMA I remember when you    was a little girl Marie. You come back    from the movies and you'd say - Mama    that ending was so sad... and I'd tell    you they had all the happy endings locked    away in a vault in Hollywood. (chuckles) And you believed me. 
MARTHA Mama, that wasn't Marie, that was me! 
MAMA (a long pause) Who are you? 
MARTHA I... I'm Martha, Mama. 
31   EXT - CONVENT, CHICKENYARD - DAY 
It is raining... distant thunder in the background. Martha is standing under an umbrella talking to Sister Anne who is feeding the chickens. 
SISTER ANNE The convent was built for over fifty. Not many of us left... just us and the chickens. 
MARTHA How do you survive? 
SISTER ANNE Oh, we own the land around here. But we rent it out. We keep a few acres for ourselves, (indicating) some wheat, corn, some vegetables. 
MARTHA Well that's a lot of land. You must have help. Do you have field hands that help you? 
SISTER ANNE No. We work the land alone. No-one but Sister Marguerite and I are permitted contact with the public. 
MARTHA Sister Anne, which was Agnes' room? 
Sister Anne points up to a window on the corner of the convent. 
SISTER ANNE Oh that one there, in the corner. 
MARTHA The one up on the third floor? 
SISTER ANNE Yes. 
MARTHA Uh huh. 
32   INT - AGNES' OLD ROOM - DAY 
Mother Miriam unlocks a padlock on the door, opens it for Martha. They both      enter the room which is totally plain, stripped of everything. 
MOTHER MIRIAM This convent is locked solid. The only one that has a key is Sister Marguerite and she wouldn't let Christ in after dark. 
MARTHA Well, it's been known to happen in the day too. Maybe Agnes went to him. 
MOTHER MIRIAM Oh come on, you've talked to her. She doesn't even know how babies are born, let alone made. 
MARTHA When did you first learn about her... innocence, the way she thinks? 
MOTHER MIRIAM Shortly after she came to us. 
MARTHA And you weren't shocked? 
MOTHER MIRIAM I was appalled, just as you are now. 
MARTHA And what happened? 
MOTHER MIRIAM She stopped eating completely... 
MOTHER MIRIAM Why? 
AGNES Look at the statues, they're thin. 
MOTHER MIRIAM Agnes... 
AGNES That's because they're suffering... suffering is beautiful, I want to be beautiful. 
MOTHER MIRIAM Who tells you these things? 
AGNES Christ said it in the Bible, he said - suffer the little children, I want to suffer like a little child. 
MOTHER MIRIAM (genuinely distressed) That's not what he meant. 
AGNES I...    I am a little child but my body keeps    getting bigger and soon I... I won't    be able to fit in, I... I won't be able    to squeeze into Heaven. 
MOTHER MIRIAM Agnes dear, Heaven is not a place where... 
Agnes gets to her knees and pushes up her breasts. 
AGNES No... I mean... I mean look at these. I've got to lose weight, I'm a blimp. 
MOTHER MIRIAM Oh my dear child. 
AGNES (standing) God blew up the Hindenburg. He'll blow me up, that's what she said... 
MOTHER MIRIAM Who? 
AGNES Mommy I'll get bigger and bigger every day and then I'll pop but... but if I stay little it won't happen. 
MOTHER MIRIAM Your mother tells you this?... Agnes your mother is dead. 
AGNES But she watches... she listens. 
MOTHER MIRIAM Nonsense, I'm your mother now and I want you to eat. 
AGNES I'm not hungry. 
MOTHER MIRIAM 
You've got to eat something Agnes. 
AGNES No I don't... the host is enough. 
MOTHER MIRIAM My dear, I don't think a communion wafer has the recommended daily allowance of anything. 
AGNES Of God. 
MOTHER MIRIAM (smiles) Yes, of God. 
Then Mother Miriam looks down and is shocked to see Agnes' white habit is spotted with blood, and more blood is dripping onto the floor. She pulls out   Agnes' hand from her habit and gasps with shock; there is a bleeding hole in the middle of her palm. 
AGNES I'm being punished. 
MOTHER MIRIAM Why? 
AGNES I don't know. 
MOTHER MIRIAM Dear Jesus... 
She quickly leads Agnes out of the chapel. 
AGNES It started this morning and I can't get it to stop. 
34   INT - AGNES' OLD ROOM - DAY 
AGNES (very quietly) I thought... thoughts... about... 
FATHER MARTINEAU Speak up, I can hardly hear you. 
AGNES (very loudly) I thought ugly thoughts about Sister Marguerite. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
40   INT - MARTHA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Martha is leafing through a sheaf of police photographs of the sheets and the waste-paper basket. She puts the photos aside and puffs thoughtfully on a cigarette. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
41   EXT - CONVENT FARM - DAY 
Agnes is milking the cow. She pours the milk into a large churn. (The singing finishes at this point). 
42   INT - JUDGE'S OFFICE - DAY 
The same four are in a meeting. This time they are all sitting except for Lyon who is standing by the window. 
LEVEAU Would you tell me why the hell this is taking so long. 
MARTHA Look there are a lot of unanswered questions here. 
LYON Martha, your job is to diagnose, not to heal and play detective. Who do you think you are? 
MARTHA I know my job. Don't tell me my job Lyon. My duty as a doctor is to... 
EVE Martha, you have to make a decision on her sanity as quickly as possible and not interfere with due process of law. 
MARTHA No... no, excuse me Eve. As quickly as I see fit. 
EVE The longer you take to make a decision, the more difficult it will be for us. 
MARTHA Why? 
EVE The bishop is breathing down our necks. 
MARTHA And the sooner she goes to prison, the better off she'll be? 
LEVEAU (in French) 
MARTHA I don't believe this. I don't bloody believe this. 
LYON Well the bishop will be very upset about this. 
MARTHA I'm fighting for this woman's life, not some bloody bishop. 
43   EXT - CONVENT GRAVEYARD - DAY 
It is a strange place; all the crosses are identical and very simple. Martha is standing. Agnes is kneeling in front of a cross marked with the name "Soeur Marie Paul" and the dates she was born, consecrated and died. Agnes places some winter flowers on the grave. 
MARTHA You liked Sister Paul? 
AGNES She was kind to me. She told me I was beautiful. 
MARTHA (crouching down) What else did she tell you? 
AGNES She said all of God's angels would want to sleep beside me if they could. I liked that. 
Agnes makes the sign of the cross, they both stand and start to move off. 
AGNES (Cont.) She lived here for almost seventy years. Every day she'd ring the bell, wake us up, call us to God. She took me to my secret place. 
MARTHA Who? 
AGNES I don't know. 
MARTHA Agnes... 
AGNES You'll laugh. 
MARTHA I promise I won't laugh. Who told her? 
AGNES An angel, when she was having one of her headaches. 
MARTHA Did your mother see angels often? 
AGNES No. 
MARTHA Do you? 
AGNES No. 
MARTHA Do you believe she really saw them? 
AGNES (sitting up) No, but I can never tell her that. 
MARTHA Why not? (no answer) Mmm? 
AGNES She'd get angry. 
Martha moves round close to Agnes. 
MARTHA Agnes, did you love your mother? 
AGNES Yes. 
MARTHA Did you ever want to be a mother yourself? 
AGNES I could never be a mother. 
MARTHA Why not? 
AGNES Well I don't think I'm old enough and besides I don't want to have a baby. 
MARTHA Why not? 
AGNES Because I don't want one. 
MARTHA If you did want one, how'd you go about getting one? 
AGNES From someone who didn't want to have a baby. 
MARTHA Like you? 
AGNES 
(suddenly frustrated) No, not like me! 
MARTHA How would that person get one if they didn't want one? 
AGNES (jumping to her feet) A mistake... 
MARTHA Agnes, how did your mother get you? 
AGNES A mistake... it was a mistake... 
MARTHA 
MOTHER MIRIAM ???     (distorted) 
MARTHA ??? (distorted) ... virginity, right Mother? Poverty, chastity and ignorance is what you live by. 
MOTHER MIRIAM I am not a virgin, Doctor. I was married for twenty three years, two daughters. I even have grandchildren... surprised? It might please you to know that I was a failure as a wife and mother. My children won't even see me any more, that's their revenge. I think they tell their friends that I've passed on. And don't tell me I'm making up for past mistakes Doctor Freud. (she sits) 
MARTHA Then help her. 
MOTHER MIRIAM I am... 
MARTHA No, you're shielding her. Let her face the world. 
MOTHER MIRIAM What good would it do. No matter what you decide it's either the... the prison or the nut house and the differences between them are pretty thin. 
MARTHA There's another choice. 
MOTHER MIRIAM What? 
MARTHA Aquittal. 
MOTHER MIRIAM How? 
MARTHA Innocence. Legal innocence. I know the judge would be happy for any reason to throw this case out of court. 
A long pause. The tension between them dissolves. 
MOTHER MIRIAM All right, what do you need. 
MARTHA Answers. 
Martha holds her hand. 
47   INT - MOTHER MIRIAM'S STUDY - DAY 
Same place, but a little later. Martha is smoking. 
MARTHA When would Agnes have conceived the child? 
MOTHER MIRIAM Oh, some time in January. 
MARTHA Do you remember anything unusual happening at the time? 
MOTHER MIRIAM Earthquakes? 
MARTHA Visitors to the convent. 
MOTHER MIRIAM Nothing. 
MARTHA Do you have a... a diary or a day book? 
MOTHER MIRIAM Yes. 
MARTHA Take at look at it. 
Mother Miriam moves to her desk and opens the day book. 
MOTHER MIRIAM There's nothing here. 
MARTHA 
Was the child full term? 
MOTHER MIRIAM (reads through the book) Oh, Dear God... 
MARTHA What is it? 
AGNES I don't know... I don't know... 
MOTHER MIRIAM (V.O.) That was the beginning, the night of the conception. That's why she burnt the sheets. 
49   INT - SICKROOM - NIGHT 
Still in flashback, Mother Miriam enters the room where SISTER PAUL lies dying. Father Martineau is there and many of the other nuns singing hymns. 
MARTHA (V.O.) When was that? 
MOTHER MIRIAM (V.O.) The twenty third of January. On that night one of our elder nuns passed away. 
MARTHA (V.O.) Sister Paul? 
MOTHER MIRIAM (V.O.) Yes. I don't remember where Agnes was. I was needed in the sick room. 
Father Martineau annoints the old woman. Then Agnes quietly slips in   unobserved. Sister Paul rallies for a moment, tries to say a single silent word to her. The smile slips from Agnes' face. Then Sister Paul lies back 
and dies. 
50   INT - CATHEDRAL - DAY 
Martha and the MONSIGNOR are walking through the church talking. He is quite young and has a rather abrasive manner. 
(beginning missed) 
MARTHA No. 
MONSIGNOR Well you're probably right about that. It certainly can't help Sister Agnes to have this investigation continued for any length of time. 
MARTHA Why do you call it an investigation? I never have. 
MONSIGNOR Your mother was a resident of Saint Catherines home before you moved her. 
MARTHA What does this have to do with..? 
MONSIGNOR And you had a sister who died in the convent. 
MARTHA Who told you this? 
MONSIGNOR Do you still go to church? 
MARTHA What business is it of yours..? 
MONSIGNOR Oh, we just wonder if you can be very objective about this case. 
MARTHA Look, Father, ah... just because I don't subscribe to the... to the beliefs you subscribe to... 
MONSIGNOR (halting) But what you believe makes no difference to us whatsoever Doctor. But it does 
make all the difference to Agnes. 
MARTHA I don't understand. Are you expecting me to..? 
MONSIGNOR Well somone's got to suffer for this Doctor. You've got to be merciful and quick. Excuse me. 
Martha stares at him as he walks away. 
51   EXT - CONVENT - DAY 
A single shot of the back of the convent and the belltower. The bell is ringing. 
52   INT - BELLTOWER - DAY 
Mother Miriam is ringing the bell and it takes quite a considerable effort. 
AGNES ... makes me... 
MARTHA Yes? 
AGNES ... take off my clothes and then... she makes fun of me. 
MARTHA She tells you you're ugly? 
AGNES Yes. 
MARTHA And that you're stupid? 
AGNES Yes. 
MARTHA That you're a mistake? 
AGNES She says my whole body's a mistake. 
MARTHA Why? 
AGNES Because she says if I don't watch out I'll have a baby. 
MARTHA How does she know that? 
AGNES Her headaches. 
MARTHA Oh, yes. 
AGNES And then... 
MARTHA What? 
AGNES She touches me down there with a cigarette. (Martha gasps) Please Mommy, don't touch me like that any more. I'll be good, I won't be a baby any more. 
MARTHA Agnes, oh Agnes, Agnes I want you to do something. I want you to pretend that I'm your mother. Oh yes, only this time I want you to tell me what you're feeling, alright? 
AGNES I'm afraid. 
MARTHA Please!    I want to help you. Let me help you. 
AGNES Alright. 
MARTHA Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say? Of course you do. Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say? 
AGNES No I'm not. 
MARTHA Are you pretty? 
AGNES Yes. 
MARTHA Agnes, you're stupid. 
AGNES No I'm not. 
MARTHA Are you intelligent? 
AGNES (more forcefully) Yes I am. 
MARTHA You're a mistake. 
AGNES (shouting) I'm not mistake, I'm here aren't I. How can I be a mistake if I'm really here. God doesn't make mistakes, you're a mistake... 
Agnes is half shouting , half crying. Martha holds on to her. 
MARTHA Oh Agnes, oh Agnes, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, I love you. 
MOTHER MIRIAM Yes. 
MARTHA Listening to angels? 
MOTHER MIRIAM She drank too much. That's what killed her. 
MARTHA Do you know what she did to her? 
MOTHER MIRIAM I don't think I care to know. 
MARTHA She molested her! 
MOTHER MIRIAM Oh, dear God. 
MARTHA There is more here than meets the eye isn't there? Lots of dirty little secrets. 
MOTHER MIRIAM (crying) Oh God, if only I'd known. 
MARTHA Why didn't you? You knew she was keeping her home from school. You knew she was an alcoholic. 
MOTHER MIRIAM I knew that after the fact. 
MARTHA Why didn't you do anything to stop her? 
MOTHER MIRIAM Because I didn't know... (she leaves) 
MARTHA Oh, God. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
58   INT - POLICE STATION, LARRY'S OFFICE - DAY 
Larry is interviewing a young PROSTITUTE in French. Martha appears at the door. 
MARTHA Larry... 
LARRY Marty, what are you doing here? 
MARTHA Larry there's got to be something missing. 
LARRY I gave you the pictures Marty, what else do you want? 
MARTHA 
Something they... that they overlooked. 
LARRY What? You think that the girl is innocent? 
MARTHA I don't know. 
LARRY You got to be crazy. 
Larry pulls out a pack of cigarettes, gives one to Martha and to the prostitute. 
MARTHA Larry... 
LARRY What's the matter with you, you've seen the reports. It's a cut and dried case. 
MARTHA Maybe there's something that's not in the report that should be. 
LARRY You're too involved Marty. (lights her cigarette) Jesus look at you. Why don't you turn this case over to someone else? 
Larry lights his own cigarette and comes over to Martha. 
LARRY (Cont.) I'll ask around, see what I come up with. In the meantime you go home and get some sleep. 
MARTHA The hypnotism. Do you still disapprove? 
MOTHER MIRIAM Would it stop you if I did? 
MARTHA No. 
They both halt. 
MOTHER MIRIAM May I be present? 
MARTHA Of course. 
MOTHER MIRIAM Then let's begin. 
64   INT - ATTIC ROOM - DAY 
The room is painted white and completely empty with a steeply sloping    ceiling. Agnes is sitting on a chair with her eyes closed, already under   hypnosis. Martha and Mother Miriam are facing her. 
MARTHA You're listening to a chorus of angels. The music surrounds you like a... warm and, comfortable pool of water. And while you're sleeping, you're going to be able to recall, all the things that we want you to remember. And when I count to three and clap my hands, you'll no longer be hypnotised. Can you hear me. 
AGNES Yes. 
MARTHA Who am I? 
AGNES Doctor Livingston. 
MARTHA And why am I here? 
AGNES To help me. 
MARTHA Good. Would you like to tell me why you're here? 
AGNES Because I'm in trouble. 
MARTHA What kind of trouble? (no answer) What kind of trouble Agnes? 
Martha starts to walk around behind Agnes. 
AGNES I'm frightened. 
MARTHA Of what? 
AGNES Of telling you. 
MARTHA But it's easy. It's just a breath with sound. Say it. What kind of trouble? 
AGNES (a pause) I had a baby. 
Both Martha and Mother Miriam react with some degree of relief. 
MARTHA How did you have a baby? 
AGNES It came out of me. 
MARTHA Did you know what was going to come 
out? 
AGNES Yes. 
MARTHA Did you want it to come out? 
AGNES No. 
MARTHA Why? 
MARTHA Who? 
AGNES Sister Marguerite I think. 
MARTHA Was it Sister Marguerite who knew about the baby? (no answer) Alright Agnes, I want you to see your room as you saw it on that night. 
MARTHA (Cont.) Open your eyes. (she opens them) What do you see? 
AGNES My bed. 
MARTHA What else? 
AGNES A crucifix. 
MARTHA Above the bed? Any... anything else? What do you you see, something different? What is it? 
AGNES (puzzled) A wastepaper basket. 
MARTHA Do you know who put it there? 
AGNES No. 
MARTHA What do you think it's there for? 
AGNES For me to get sick in. 
MARTHA Are you ill? 
AGNES Yes. 
MARTHA What do you feel? 
AGNES I feel as if I've eaten glass. 
MARTHA What do you do? 
AGNES I have to throw up... 
And she falls to her knees, retching horribly. 
AGNES (Cont.) I can't... glass... one of the sisters has fed me glass. 
MARTHA Which one? 
AGNES I don't know which one (distorted) 
MARTHA Of what? 
AGNES Of me. Oh... God! My God... (assumes the birth position and looks between her legs) Water... it's all water... 
MARTHA Why isn't anyone coming? 
AGNES (trying to wipe up the water) They can't hear me that's why. (in terrible pain) Oh God... I don't wanna... 
MOTHER MIRIAM (to Martha) Stop her! 
Then Agnes tries to crawl away as though terrified of something. 
MARTHA What is it? 
AGNES 
Please get away from me... 
MARTHA Who? 
67   INT - CRYPT - DAY

Mother Miriam addresses the secretary, HELEN. 
MOTHER MIRIAM Is the Doctor in her office? 
HELEN Ah, who shall I say is calling? 
MOTHER MIRIAM (grimly) General MacArthur. 
She heads onto Martha's office. Helen jumps up after her. 
HELEN Just a minute please, you can't go in there. 
Mother Miriam pushes the door open to reveal Martha. 
MARTHA (standing) It's... it's alright Helen, just close the door. 
Mother Miriam walks in and throws some papers down onto Martha's desk. 
MOTHER MIRIAM I've just met with the bishop. We're taking you off the case. 
MARTHA (picking up the papers) You're what? 
MOTHER MIRIAM If we want to hire a psychiatrist for Agnes. we'll find our own, thank you. (starts to leave) 
MARTHA One that will ask the questions you want asked. 
MOTHER MIRIAM (halting) One that will approach this matter with some objectivity and respect. 
MARTHA For the Church? 
MOTHER MIRIAM For Agnes. 
MARTHA You think she's a saint? 
MOTHER MIRIAM She's been touched by God, yes. 
MARTHA How? How? She hallucinates, stops eating and bleeds spontaneously. Is that supposed to convince me she shouldn't be touched. Give me a miracle. 
MARTHA Who was that person Mother?    Was it you? 
MOTHER MIRIAM If you believe this is murder, it is the Crown attorney you have to talk to, not me. And definitely not Agnes. 
She goes out and slams the door. 
74   EXT - POND - DAY 
After a couple of establishing shots of the convent, the nuns are shown ice   skating on the frozen pond. They are quite uninhibited, like little children. Their singing (off) from the chapel continues until the end of scene 78. 
75   INT - CHAPEL - DAY 
Sister Genevieve, the other novice is being consecrated. She approaches the altar all dressed in white, carrying a single candle and kneels down. 
76   INT - LAW COURTS - DAY 
Martha and Justice Leveau come up the steps and into the corridor. 
MARTHA All I want is one more week. 
LEVEAU Why? (continues in French, then...) You've done nothing to show any progress. 
MARTHA Yes, that's because I'm getting to her. 
LEVEAU You're getting to all of us Martha, let's face it. 
MARTHA I'll have a decision by next week. 
LEVEAU It's gone on long enough. You're out. 
MARTHA Oh Joe... Joe she didn't kill the baby. 
LEVEAU (halting) You have proof? 
MARTHA I'll have it. 
LEVEAU When? 
MARTHA Next week. 
LEVEAU (walking on) No, no, no... 
MARTHA 
I can get you new evidence next week. 
LEVEAU No! 
MARTHA Tomorrow... tomorrow, I'll get it by tomorrow. I will. 
They reach the door of Leveau's office. He thinks... 
LEVEAU Yes, demain (?) 
77   INT - CHAPEL - DAY 
The scene consists of a number of shots dissolving into one another. Sister Genevieve lying face down in front of the bishop, Genevieve praying on her   knees, her family (4) watching from behind the grilled gate. Genevieve's hair being cut, her joy at the habit being fitted to her, running out to join her family, a jolly old singalong on the piano, this time the nuns singing along from    behind the gate. 
78   EXT - CONVENT - DAY 
Martha drives up in her car and walks across the now snow covered grounds to    the convent. 
79   INT - MOTHER MIRIAM'S OFFICE - DAY 
Mother Miriam is working away at her desk when a nun interrupts. Singing   from the party can faintly be heard. 
MOTHER MIRIAM I left it with her and I went for help. 
MARTHA I doubt that's what she'd say. 
MOTHER MIRIAM Then she's a liar. 
80   INT - ATTIC ROOM - DAY 
It is the same as before, except that this time Martha and Mother Miriam are      standing. 
MARTHA Agnes, can you hear me? 
AGNES Yes. 
MARTHA I want you to remember if you can a night last January. The night Sister Paul died. Do you remember. 
There is a flash cut to Sister Paul being annointed. Agnes stirs slightly. 
MARTHA (Cont.) What's the matter? 
There is another flash cut, this time of Sister Paul saying that mysterious word that we could not previously understand. 
AGNES She said Michael. 
MARTHA What did she mean? 
There is a third flash cut of the shrine of Saint Michael in the crypt. 
AGNES The statue. She had shown it to me the day before. 
MARTHA And the passage to the barn? 
AGNES Yes. 
MARTHA Why? 
AGNES So I could go to him. 
MARTHA Who? 
AGNES Him. 
MARTHA How did she know about him? 
AGNES She'd seen him too. 
MARTHA Where? 
AGNES From the belltower the day she before she died. 
MARTHA So she sent you? 
AGNES Yes. 
81   INT - TUNNEL - NIGHT 
In flashback:    Agnes is walking alone through the tunnel carrying an oil lamp. 
MARTHA (V.O.) What happened? 
Agnes keeps walking and finally goes up the steps into... 
82   INT - BARN - NIGHT 
Still in flashback, Agnes emerges into the barn. The doves flap about as Agnes    moves nervously through the barn.

2 INT. TOYOTA PRIUS-DAY 2 
It's a bright, clear Los Angeles Saturday afternoon. Celeste and Jesse, now 30, both sing along to "Love Rhino," the song heard under the montage. Jesse drives while Celeste is on her Blackberry. Jesse, boyishly handsome, wears an old tee and a hooded sweatshirt. Celeste is wearing all black workout gear. She is always wearing all black. 
JESSE I'm a Love Rhino... 
CELESTE JESSE Don't worry `bout me, I've Dont' worry `bout me, I've got a enough love for got enough love, for the two the...(her Blackberry rings) us. Oh please... oh shit, I gotta take this. Turn it down. 
JESSE (CONT'D) (CONTD) ...I'm a Love... 
CELESTE Jess, turn it down, seriously! 
She playfully slaps him. He turns it down. A little. 
CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) Hello? Hi. With Jesse, running errands. (to Jesse) Turn it down. More. (back to the phone) Yeah, I can do it now. No, it'll be fast, right? (To Jesse) Hey, I have to give a quick sound bite for the New York Times, so no noise please? For a second? 
JESSE Maybe. I may have an important call coming in too, so... 
They both know he has no important call coming in. 
CELESTE (on the phone) Okay. Ready? This year all trends point towards simplicity and comfort. 
Celeste is momentarily distracted by a bad driver in front of them. 
CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) Jess, just go around him! (To the phone) Sorry. (MORE) 
CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) Consumers will be less likely to go out for entertainment. 
While Celeste is dictating, Jesse is getting bored. He starts looking through the middle console. He finds something. A melted tube of Chapstick. Ew. Ooh, a cigarette. Jesse lights the cigarette, takes a drag. Celeste looks at Jesse and signals to him, "Can I have a drag?" 
CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) Uhhh, things like Voodoo, casual wear and cookbooks will see a huge spike in the market. 
He hands her the cigarette and she promptly chucks it out the window. 
JESSE What the shit?? 
CELESTE (she whispers to Jesse) Shhh. Phone call.(back to her call) That's enough of a blurb, right? 
Jesse is now checking out nose hairs in the visor mirror. He then looks at his teeth. 
JESSE Does this tooth look dark? 
Celeste just glares at him. 
CELESTE Okay. Call me back if they need more. 
Jesse looks at his tooth again in the rearview mirror. 
JESSE Like a little darker than the rest? 
Celeste waves her hand to quiet Jesse. 
CELESTE Okay, thanks bye. (to Jesse) Can't you just sit still for two minutes? And we talked about this, no more smoking! 
JESSE I wasn't smoking, I just found it. 
JESSE Oh yeah. No. They haven't called yet. But if they don't think I'm the right artist to illustrate the book, then it's not the right job for me. You know what I mean? 
CELESTE I absolutely do, yes. You are a wonderful artist. But at some point, you will show the world that one day...right? 
JESSE Hey, can I drop you at home now? Because I just missed a wave. 
CELESTE Well... 
JESSE Wait! I just missed another one. 
CELESTE Yeah. Take me home, it's fine. 
CUT TO: 
4 INT. TOYOTA PRIUS-30 MINUTES LATER 4 
Jesse is dropping Celeste at home. 
CELESTE Be back by six so you can shower. 
JESSE Why shower? 
CELESTE Dinner with Beth and Tucker. 
JESSE Right, right. 
CELESTE Have fun shredding your glassy peel. 
JESSE Aw, so wrong. 
CELESTE Love you. 
JESSE Love you too. 
He promptly blasts the radio and flashes their signature "C and J" hand sign. She flashes it back. He zooms off. 
5 INT. LITTLE DOM'S-NIGHT 5 
Celeste and Jesse are on double date with BETH, 30, petite, and full of energy and TUCKER, 31, preppy in an indy way. These are their best friends from college. They're engaged. 
TUCKER Did you end up going to see that band at Spaceland last week? 
JESSE Oh, The Injured Saint? Yeah, dude. They are real. You know what? They should be your wedding band. (MORE) 
JESSE (CONTD) They're loud but they're affordable. 
CELESTE They opened for Darcy Fudged His Knickers. Now, they're amazing. You'd be lucky to book them for your wedding. Or you should see if Emergency Breakthrough is available. The horn section is tight. 
BETH It's already done. We got the best swing band in New England. Sugarfoot and The Swingin' Scrod. 
TUCKER I told you, I'm not doing it. Swing is so late 90's, honey. 
Beth leans over a gives him a deep kiss. She knows how to work him. 
BETH I love you. We'll talk about this later. 
Celeste looks over the menu. Celeste and Jesse's next interaction is said with heavy, really bad German accents, which is hilarious--only to them. 
CELESTE So veee ahhh gawwnna share zeh beet zalad and zeh bolognese, riiiiiiight? 
JESSE Yawh. But I em murdering zeh creme brulee alooooone. No sharrrrring. 
CELESTE I don't vant dessert. I vill joost have bite oof yorrrs. 
JESSE Ve know zeh end of zat story. Yawh we doooooo! 
CELESTE Yawh!!!! 
Celeste and Jesse giggle at their stupid inside joke for a little too long. Then, there is a deafening lull in the conversation. Beth is buttering a piece of bread. She loudly drops the knife on her plate and buries her head in her hands. 
BETH I can't do this. I just can't. 
Celeste is genuinely concerned about her friend. 
CELESTE Are you okay? Oh no... 
BETH It's just not right. I can't hold my tongue. We can't do this anymore. 
CELESTE Honey, weddings are stressful, I know all about it. But you guys we'll be fine! 
CELESTE Oh, don't forget, the contractor needs to get in there for measurements in the morning. So make sure your thingys, your sculptures, whatever...are out of the way. 
JESSE Got it. 
CELESTE Night. 
JESSE Night. Love you. 
CELESTE Love you too. 
8 INT. CELESTE'S HOUSE-MORNING 8 
Celeste's morning symphony is under way. She sits in front of a bowl of oatmeal, a bowl of berries, a cup of coffee, 4 neatly stacked newspapers, her laptop and the television tuned to CNN. She methodically eats, sips her coffee, reads the paper, watches TV, and surfs the internet. She is clearly a culture vulture. Jesse walks by outside his studio and does the "C and J" sign to Celeste. She does it back instinctively. Is it weird that we hang out so much? She shakes it off and titters. She's being ridiculous; it's fine. 
9 INT. COFFEE BEAN- MORNING 9 
Celeste walks in, dressed impeccably. Again, in all black. She is in a rush, on her Blackberry, bombarded with a hefty pre-work crowd. People are in some semblance of a line, waiting to order. 
Celeste spots a man in a business suit, taking advantage of the confusion and cutting in front of a woman at the head of the line. He orders. 
BUSINESS MAN Large coffee, please. 
CELESTE Excuse me, sir? 
The business man pretends to not hear her. 
CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) Sir? You? 
She taps him on the arm. He turns around. 
CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) You do realize that you just cut in front of a lot of people. 
BUSINESS MAN Oh. Sorry, I didn't know. 
CELESTE Did you not? 
BUSINESS MAN I'm in a rush. 
CELESTE So you did know. And everyone's in a rush, so... 
Other people in line are now paying attention. Celeste wants to let it go, but she can't. 
BUSINESS MAN Well, she was looking at the pastries, I didn't think she was ready to order. 
CELESTE Well, it's not just her. It's everyone behind her too. So, if you want to ask all these people if it's okay to cut in front of them because you are late, be my guest. Just don't assume that your time is more important than everyone else's. 
The business man gets his coffee. 
BUSINESS MAN Have a nice day. 
CELESTE (sotto) Prick. 
10 INT. POP FORM CONFERENCE ROOM-MORNING 10 
Pop Form Headquarters looks like the future. No walls, just large glass slabs, separate the offices from each other. 
Celeste is on camera, in the middle of conducting a live satellite interview for MSNBC. 
CELESTE American culture is dying. We have an unrelenting appetite for processed junk food, talentless pop stars like Riley Banks and recycled movie franchises like Transformers. The more we consume crap, the more we want crap. 
CUT TO: 
11 INT. MSNBC STUDIOS 11 
Rachel Maddow is conducting the interview in studio. 
RACHEL MADDOW Sounds utterly hopeless. Is there an upshot? 
CELESTE I think there will be a groundswell movement towards simplicity. People will start to listen to their most rudimentary needs-- they will crave mental, spiritual and physical nourishment. It's back to basics. 
RACHEL MADDOW Wow, a lot to chew on. Well, thanks for being with us today. You're great, come back any time. For more on this gloomy but interesting subject, look out for trend forecaster, Celeste Martin's new book "Shitegeist," on bookshelves Monday. 
CELESTE Thanks so much, Rachel. 
12 INT. SCOTT'S OFFICE-AFTERNOON 12 
SCOTT, 40, Celeste's partner, gay but very straight, sharply dressed and bespectacled, sits at his desk. Celeste enters. 
CELESTE So I had dinner with the drama club last night. 
Jesse looks uncomfortable. 
JESSE That was a one time thing, a couple months after Celeste and I broke up. Celeste does not know about that. And we will keep it that way. 
SKILLZ Didn't know that was a hit and run. Sounded like you liked her. 
JESSE Well, she's not Celeste. It's always been Celeste. I'm not ready to give up. 
SKILLZ Okay, but remember, you can't re- heat a souffle. 
JESSE Huh? 
SKILLZ Also, there's Bettys everywhere. It's LA. Maybe it's good to remind Celeste that you can pull wool. Make her sweat a little bit. 
JESSE It definitely wouldn't hurt to...go out with somebody. 
They reach the front of the line. 
YOGURT GIRL Do you know what you want? 
JESSE Yeah, I want to not be a quitter. I don't want to start all over again. I want everything that I believed to have been true to be true. I also want a goji berry/green tea swirl with yogurt chips and Fruity Pebbles. Please. 
SKILLZ (to Yogurt Girl) Hey, you should go out on a date with my friend here. 
YOGURT GIRL Um, wait, where's your wife? You guys are here like everyday together. 
JESSE Well...we're separated. 
YOGURT GIRL Oh. Cool. I mean, bummer. But okay. I'll go. 
14 INT. LACMA-LATE AFTERNOON 14 
Celeste and Beth wander amidst the modern art. They stop to take in a Cindy Sherman photo. 
BETH It's so...grotesque. 
CELESTE But kind of beautiful. In a grotesque way. 
BETH Ugh, let's keep moving. Too many feelings. 
Celeste and Beth wander to the wall and stare at a Damien Hirst collage. 
BETH (CONT'D) (CONTD) I need to say this and then I'll never bring it up again. I'm sorry I wigged on you guys the other night but I don't know what you're doing. I think it's stupid that you're not together. You are best friends and that's the hard part. Nothing else matters. 
Celeste and Beth stand in silence. Then: 
CELESTE Beth, the reality is I love Jesse dearly but he doesn't have a checking account. Or dress shoes. The father of my children will have a car. But...Jesse will always be my best friend. 
BETH Okay fine. I've said my peace. It's your life. But I definitely don't think he should be living in your guest house. I think you're kind of breaking his heart. Slowly. 
CELESTE Jesse is fine. 
BETH Can I show you something? 
CELESTE Sure. 
Beth suddenly pulls Celeste into a corner. With no art. 
BETH Okay. Look. 
She points to her neck. 
CELESTE What am I looking at? 
BETH It's a hair. On my NECK. 
CELESTE Ewww. Will you get that thing lasered off, please? What the fuck? 
BETH I can't because it will pop up somewhere else where I can't keep my eye on it. 
CELESTE Are you serious? That's the craziest thing I've ever heard. It's not a turnip. 
BETH Trust me, I know my body. It's a cruel land mine. 
CELESTE Okay, well at least pluck it for Chrissake. 
BETH I should, at least before my wedding, right? 
CELESTE What is wrong with you? 
JESSE What? Oh. I don't know, is it weird? 
CELESTE Not weird, just different from how it looks best. 
She walks over and starts messing with his hair as he continues. 
JESSE Anyway, this is what we're doing right? We're getting divorced and we're friends and we're also dating people? That's what we're doing? 
She is satisfied with her work. She steps back. 
CELESTE There. Better. You'll be great. You don't even need to be great. Just be you. Take her somewhere nice. 
JESSE Okay mom. 
CELESTE Call me after? 
16 INT. HATFIELD'S RESTAURANT-NIGHT 16 
Jesse is on a date with Yogurt girl. It's clear he's hasn't been doing a lot of talking. 
YOGURT GIRL So I was in school but then I dropped out because I really wanted to work in fashion but it's really hard to find a paid internship? So I went back to school and now I work at Yoga Yurt part time but I'm really looking to make money doing something I love? But I'm sure the universe is looking out for me and when the time is right, the right thing will come along, you know? 
CUT TO: 
17 INT. CELESTE'S BEDROOM- NIGHT 17 
Celeste is in bed on the computer. She hears noise from the outside. She listens more intently and hears Jesse... and a woman, giggling and talking loudly. Then, the studio door shuts. Is Yogurt Girl sleeping over? He wouldn't do that. Would he? 
18 EXT. CELESTE'S GARDEN- NEXT MORNING 18 
Again, with the morning symphony. Celeste drinks coffee, eats breakfast, surfs the internet and flips through magazines. This time, she's also listening to a song from Riley Banks' new album. It's exactly what she thought it would be. Overproduced, auto-tuned and meaningless. She nods her head, "yeah, I get it." She turns it off. 
Celeste can't stop herself from constantly looking over at the studio to see if Yogurt Girl is still in there. Finally, a sleeping Jesse stirs for a minute and changes position. He is alone. Phew. 
19 INT. BORDER'S BOOKS-LATER THAT DAY 19 
Celeste, Beth, Tucker and Jesse browse as a foursome for books. 
CELESTE Where is it? They told me it would be in new releases... 
Celeste searches frantically for her book. She peeks around a corner at a very obscured aisle with a sign reading "More New Releases." Three copies of her book, "Shitegeist" appear in the very bottom row, barely visible. She is disappointed. 
CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) That's what I call placement. 
She grabs a copy of her book and briskly walks back to the front of the store. 
BETH Well you probably shouldn't steal it. Even if it is yours. 
Celeste marches to the Oprah's Book Club table and swiftly replaces the center display book with her own. 
CELESTE There. 
BETH But you don't have the "O" on your cover, you can't do that! 
CELESTE Yes I can. 
Jesse and Tucker arrive and see the book. 
JESSE There you guys are...you're on Oprah's Book List?? That's so great! 
Something catches Celeste's eye. 
CELESTE Some people are browsing my book. Guys, come with me to eavesdrop ... 
Celeste, Tucker and Beth head off. Then: 
GIRL (V.O.) Jesse? 
Jesse turns to see VERONICA, 26, stunning and European. 
JESSE Veronica? 
VERONICA Yeah, hey. How are you? 
JESSE Good, good. You look great. 
VERONICA Thanks, you too. How's your clothes pin collage going? 
JESSE Slowly, but it's going. 
JESSE Well, how hard can it be? It's a dresser, right? 
TIME CUT TO: 
22 INT. CELESTE'S HOUSE- 30 MINUTES LATER 22 
Jesse is drunker than before and sitting where Celeste was earlier. Crying, frustrated. He's covered in sawdust and nuts and bolts. 
JESSE Fuck me!!! Do you think they intentionally pick a random piece of furniture to make totally unbuildable, just to fuck with you??! 
CELESTE Thank you! 
JESSE Wait. I got it. 
TIME CUT TO: 
23 INT. CELESTE'S HOUSE- 30 MORE MINUTES LATER 23 
We see Jesse and Celeste admire their "dresser" as they drink wine. 
CELESTE Perfect. 
JESSE Fucking lay-up. 
We reveal that they are looking at a small, mangled, Swedish robot constructed from the nuts and bolts and wood panelling that should have been the dresser. They both slide to the floor in satisfaction. They look at their "artwork." They laugh; they are pretty drunk. 
CELESTE Ruscha meets Basquiat... 
JESSE ...meets Serra meets Corky from "Life Goes On." 
CELESTE Yeah. He's a vegan, you know. 
JESSE Cherish. That is so cute. 
They share a laugh. 
CELESTE You're cute. 
Celeste looks at him. She kisses him. He kisses back. It gets hotter. They fall back. 
FADE TO: 
24 INT. CELESTE'S BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING 24 
Celeste and Jesse are in bed. Celeste is asleep. Jesse wakes up and gently kisses Celeste all over her face. This wakes her up. She is hungover and confused. 
CELESTE Hey. What are you doing? 
JESSE I love you. 
Celeste does not respond. She pops up out of bed. 
CELESTE Okay... 
JESSE We should talk about this. 
CELESTE Yeah. Whoa, we were drunk. What a bad idea. I'm sorry. 
JESSE Don't be sorry. It was nice. And I love you. 
CELESTE Oh Jess, I don't...come on, we were drunk, and the dresser and I thought...you're dating other people! 
JESSE Only to...god, I'm so stupid. 
He realizes how pathetic it sounds. 
CELESTE Oh no, I thought... 
JESSE You thought what? 
CELESTE Well, clearly I wasn't thinking. Or I wouldn't have let it happen. Come on Jess, we're not getting back together, you didn't think... 
Celeste realizes he did think...Jesse is crushed. He gets up and leaves. He turns. 
JESSE You know, there's a guy that you can call, from Ikea, that will build you're dresser. You should call him. Hell, he'll probably fuck you too. I'm a fucking idiot. 
CELESTE Jess! No, I didn't..Jess! 
Celeste collapses back in the bed. 
29 INT. SAN FRANCISCO W HOTEL ROOM-NIGHT 29 
Celeste watches CNN alone. She dials Jesse. It rings. 
CUT TO: 
30 INT. DOWNTOWN L.A. DINER-LATE AFTERNOON 30 
Jesse is mid-laugh and looks at his phone to see Celeste is calling. He presses "Ignore." We see that he is sitting with a women. We reveal that it is: Veronica. 
VERONICA I'm glad you called. 
Jesse smiles big. 
CUT TO: 
31 INT. SAN FRANCISCO W HOTEL ROOM-NIGHT 31 
CELESTE Hey. It's me. Again. I miss you. Anyway, call me. Okay. Bye. 
She hangs up, takes a breath and then, to herself: 
CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) I love you. I'm so sorry. I've always loved you. 
She chuckles. 
CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) Of course. Stupid. 
32 EXT. STREET - WEST HOLLYWOOD-DAY 32 
Jesse is walking. 
JESSE (on the phone) Hey. You're back. I want to talk to you. 
33 INT. CELESTE'S HOUSE-SUNDOWN 33 
Celeste is in her home office, working on the Riley account. 
CELESTE Yeah, I want to talk to you too. Where have you been?? It's been like two weeks. So much to lay down...like, did you know that pay- per-view porn is available in Cantonese? 
34 EXT. STREET-WEST HOLLYWOOD-SUNDOWN 34 
JESSE Really? Like subtitles or dubbed? Wait, actually, I'm really close to your house right now. Can I come by for a minute? It's....important. 
CUT TO: 
35 INT. CELESTE'S HOUSE-NIGHT 35 
Celeste puts away groceries. 
JESSE Okay. I have to tell you something. 
CELESTE Me too. Wait, you first. Are you gay? 
JESSE No, not gay. 
He takes a really deep breath. 
JESSE (CONT'D) (CONTD) Um, you're not gonna believe this but... 
CELESTE (playfully) Oh no, did you go on another date? 
JESSE I'm having a baby. 
CELESTE I don't understand. 
JESSE I'm having a baby. 
Celeste is still busy, putting away groceries. She is half- listening. 
CELESTE What do you mean? 
JESSE I am having a baby. 
Celeste opens the pantry and puts away cereal. 
CELESTE With another person? 
JESSE Yes. With another person. 
CELESTE Well, just part of our job, so...ready for breaking news? Jesse is having a baby with some girl. Crazy. 
SCOTT Whoa. Wow. Did you even know he was seeing someone? 
CELESTE It's this girl he slept with once a couple of months ago. (MORE) 
CELESTE (CONTD) And now he's "making it work" with her. Plane crash. 
SCOTT I don't know what to say. I am so sorry, Celeste. 
CELESTE No need, Scott, I'm totally fine. 
SCOTT Are you? 
CELESTE Look, I wasn't going to have his baby. So, good for him. 
SCOTT Well, it's great that you're so resolved about this but it's also okay for you to have feelings. It's very sudden. 
Celeste pauses to consider this. 
CELESTE Right. Well, let me see...mmmm, nope, I'm fine. I promise. Not in love with him anymore. It kind of makes it easier. 
Scott is not convinced. Celeste is still distracted by the computer. 
CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) Oh my god, Diddy's snowboarding for the first time in Mammoth! Amazing. I actually have a date tonight. 
SCOTT Um...that's great. Who's the guy? 
CELESTE The yahoo who did Pop Form's taxes last quarter. He's been asking me out forever. Not the one, but it'll be nice to be admired. 
SCOTT I agree, go be admired. Who knows, you may actually even simulate human emotion. 
38 INT. CELESTE'S HOUSE-EARLY EVENING 38 
Celeste, in workout clothes, is cleaning up her house maniacally. She is walking past her office. The Ikea robot she built with Jesse catches her attention for a moment. She keeps walking. 
39 INT. MADEO'S RESTAURANT-NIGHT 39 
Celeste and MAX, 38, handsome and clean cut, are sitting at dinner. They have just ordered. 
CELESTE Thank you. 
She hands the menu back to the waiter. 
CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) My foot actually pronates. And my I.T. band is strained when I run, which really hurts. So Dr. Ozar recommended a foot specialist who made these customized orthotics for me and it's amazing how much better I feel. 
MAX Well, actually I... 
Suddenly, Celeste catches a glimpse of Jesse, sitting at the bar, by himself, watching tv. She is not prepared for this. 
CELESTE OH MY GOD. My ex is here. Oh god, oh no, we just made eye contact. Maybe he didn't see me. Wait, he did. He's coming over. Oh god, this is so awkward.(to Max) You should probably leave. 
MAX Wait, what? I don't think...really? 
CELESTE Yeah, just go. 
Jesse is at the table. 
CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) Too late. Here he is, heyyyy. 
JESSE I just wanted to say hi. I'm Jesse. 
CELESTE Oh, this is Matt. 
MAX Max. 
CELESTE Mack. 
MAX Max. 
JESSE Nice to meet you, Max. 
CELESTE We're just here. Just eating. It's a date. I'm dating. 
JESSE Cool. The puttanesca special is the thing to get. 
MAX Good to know. I ordered that. 
A moment of awkward silences passes. 
CELESTE Oh, okay! Wow, is this it? It's so nice. 
Celeste flops on the couch full prostrate. A saleswoman approaches. 
SALESWOMAN I'm so sorry but that's a one-of-a- kind piece that was handwoven by a tribe of Afghani women. So if you could maybe just sit over there? 
The saleswoman points to a metal industrial, uncomfortable looking chair. 
CELESTE Right. Sorry. Totally. 
BETH Wow, you are a sweat tsunami. 
CELESTE You should get it. It's really pretty. 
Celeste gets up and there is an outline of Celeste's entire body in sunblock and sweat. They look at the wreckage. 
BETH Uh boy. 
CELESTE Don't worry. I know people who can get that out. Easily. 
BETH Okay. I guess I'm getting it. 
43 INT. H.D. BUTTERCUP-SALES COUNTER-DAY 43 
The saleswoman is ringing Beth up for the couch. It is basically ruined. 
CELESTE The Riley account is a handful. I've been sooooo swamped. 
BETH It's great you're staying busy... 
CELESTE (about the couch) If it doesn't come out, I can have it reupholstered. 
BETH Thanks. How's dating? 
SALESWOMAN Sorry, can I get your card? 
BETH Here you go. 
CELESTE Great. Dating's really great. 
BETH Have you talked to Jesse? 
CELESTE No, but I actually ran into him last night. I think he's getting a little fat. 
BETH I think he's been looking pretty fit lately. (to the saleswoman) Can I get a rush delivery on that? 
CELESTE So you've seen Jesse? 
BETH ...Yeah, I have. 
CELESTE Huh. Have you hung out with... 
BETH Veronica? 
CELESTE Yeah. 
BETH Yes. I have. 
Silence. 
SALESWOMAN So, my first available delivery is Monday afternoon. Does that work for you? 
BETH Yeah, that's fine. If you can you just call my cell... 
CELESTE She's dumb, right? 
BETH Huh? Oh no, not dumb. Simple. 
CELESTE Simple means dumb. 
BETH No, actually, simple in a really elegant way. 
CELESTE Elegant?? 
The saleswoman senses awkwardness. 
SALESWOMAN Okay, so you're all set then. 
CELESTE Elegant?? 
WAITRESS We have decaf green tea. 
CELESTE Water's fine. 
WAITRESS K. Anything for you? 
JESSE I'll get the veganchilada with the cashew cheese sauce on the side. Oh can I look at the seaweed menu? 
She hands him a tiny piece of recycled paper. 
JESSE (CONT'D) (CONTD) Oh. Awesome. You do have the Baltic kelp today. I'll get that. Thanks. 
CELESTE Wow. 
JESSE How are you? You look great. 
CELESTE Thanks. 
She notices his feet. 
CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) Are you wearing...dress shoes? 
JESSE Oh yeah, they're vegan. 
Celeste could throw up. 
CELESTE You look good too. 
JESSE A lot of pilates. 
CELESTE Huh, I didn't know you did pilates. 
JESSE Yeah, well, Veronica's a dancer and has equipment at our house, so... 
There is an uncomfortable beat. 
JESSE (CONT'D) (CONTD) How's work? 
CELESTE Um...work is great. 
JESSE Good. 
CELESTE My book is getting great reviews. Riley Banks is a new client which is huge. Things are going really well. 
JESSE Great. 
Long silence. 
JESSE (CONT'D) (CONTD) Listen, I know this has all been pretty weird. 
CELESTE It's only weird if you think it's weird. 
JESSE Celeste, I never wanted to hurt you. 
CELESTE Thank you. You didn't. Glad we cleared that up. 
JESSE Look, I actually wanted to see you because...apparently there's some kind of hold up on your side with the divorce papers and Veronica's actually not a citizen so.. 
CELESTE What? Where's she from? 
JESSE Uh, Belgium. 
CELESTE (sotto) Huh. Belgium. Elegant. 
JESSE What? 
CELESTE Nothing. 
JESSE Point is, we need to...get married. I'm sorry. I really need you to sign those papers. 
CELESTE Well, Jesse, I've been busy with work. Because some people work for a living. So I haven't really been focused on what I can do to help you get on with your new life. 
JESSE I'm sorry. I know. 
CELESTE What makes you think you are even suitable to be a dad?? You don't even know how to read the electric bill. How are you going to support yourself? Have you even thought this through? 
JESSE I guess I'll have to figure it out. Veronica is really supportive of my work. 
CELESTE Really? Really Jesse? I paid the rent for ten years. If that's not supportive, I don't know what is. 
CELESTE What? Oh, White trash. 
Snow White is silent. Celeste points to her trash bag. 
CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) White trash? 
SNOW WHITE (doesn't get it) Huh. 
Paul (from yoga) enters to grab some ice from the freezer. He is wearing a black shirt covered in mini cereal boxes with plastic knives through them. Celeste is mid-Car Bomb and wasted. 
PAUL Celeste? 
CELESTE Yoga? 
PAUL Yeah, I haven't seen you there for a while. 
CELESTE I've been running a lot. Keeps you in better shape. 
PAUL I can see that's important to you. (referring to the Car Bomb in her FACE) 
Celeste is now drunk. 
CELESTE How's your practice? (waving her finger in his face, laughing) 
PAUL White trash? 
CELESTE Uh huh. What are you? 
PAUL Um, a cereal killer, obviously. 
CELESTE You're "punny." 
PAUL By the way, you were right. 
CELESTE About what? 
PAUL About me. All of it, the car, the phone, the yoga. Except that I did go to an Ivy League school. Cornell. 
CELESTE Barely an Ivy. 
PAUL I know. 
CELESTE Do you smoke? 
PAUL At parties. 
CELESTE Me too. Let's go. 
58 EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS HOME BACKYARD-NIGHT 58 
Celeste and Paul sit away from the party, smoking cigarettes. 
PAUL (Playful) Sorry about that day at the gym. I feel really open after yoga... 
CELESTE Shhhh. Don't say open. Your costume's great. Don't ruin it. 
PAUL I'm kidding. I only go to yoga to meet girls. Speaking of, what's the deal with you and me? Is this happening? Or... 
CELESTE My husband of six years wants a divorce so he can marry the woman who's carrying his child. That's the deal with you and me. 
PAUL I'm sorry, that sounds tough. 
CELESTE He's having a baby with a girl he barely knows. He's so lost. He's just going about it all...wrong. 
PAUL And you're right. Now what? 
CELESTE What do you mean? 
PAUL Well do you want to be right or do you want to be happy? 
CELESTE Listen, Yoga, I don't WANT to be right, I AM right. People will let you down. I've accepted that fact, but unfortunately, most of the time, knowing that does keep you from being happy. But at least it's real. 
PAUL No one has ever given a more self- righteous monologue wearing only a trash bag. Except for maybe the homeless guy outside my dry cleaners. 
Beth and Tucker approach Celeste and Paul. 
BETH Time to go, drunky. 
They head off. 
CELESTE Hey! 
JESSE What...are you doing? 
CELESTE I just... 
She looks around to make an excuse. 
CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) Um...came over to drop off some of your stuff. 
JESSE But why were you in the trash can? 
CELESTE I lost something. 
JESSE In the trash can? 
CELESTE My bracelet. It was a whole thing. It's over now. 
Jesse and Veronica just stare at Celeste for a long beat. 
JESSE You've met Veronica, right? 
CELESTE Yes! Hi! Wow, you're so pregnant, right! I love your sweater. 
VERONICA Oh. Thanks! (beat) Are you bleeding? 
CELESTE What? Oh (she touches her cheek), yeah, I guess I am. 
VERONICA Let me get you something for that. 
CELESTE NO. No, don't. It's fine, just a little cut. 
VERONICA Are you sure? I'm so sorry about this. 
CELESTE No, I'm sorry. So sorry. Well, I'm late for things. Have a good afternight. 
VERONICA You sure you don't want to come in for a drink? 
CELESTE Nooooo, no. That's very nice but no. Great to see you guys! Okay. 
She starts to walk away with the journal. 
JESSE Is that mine? 
CELESTE Waht? Oh, yeah, that's weird. I don't know how...here you go. 
She laughs nervously and hands him his journal. Celeste walks to her car. 
65 INT. POP FORM-CELESTE'S OFFICE- NEXT DAY 65 
Celeste listen to her work messages on speakerphone as she Instant Messenger's with Beth. Celeste writes "I went through Jesse's trash last night. Oh no." Beth writes back, "I'm coming to your office right now." 
PAUL (V.O.) Hey. Celeste. It's Paul. The cereal killer? There's this yoga retreat in Tulum that I just got an e-mail about...uh, that's not why I'm really calling. I just like you. Call me back if you want to drink some cold beer with me. 310 864- 
66 EXT. POP FORM COURTYARD- 30 MINUTES LATER 66 
Celeste and Beth eat lunch in the zen garden outside the Pop Form building. Celeste is picking at the end of her sandwich, recounting the waking nightmare of last night. The cut on her face is neatly bandaged. 
BETH You told her you liked her sweater? What are you, twelve? 
CELESTE It was a disaster. But you should have seen the sweater. So great. Beth, am I losing my mind? 
BETH Maybe. No. Please no more trash- diving. Let's focus on you now. 
CELESTE This guys Paul keeps calling me but I don't know... 
BETH C, you never know. Just go out with him. It doesn't have to be perfect... 
CELESTE I met him at the gym. I'm not meeting my husband at the gym. 
BETH Just go. Nothing to lose. 
CUT TO: 
67 INT. PHO SIAM THAI MASSAGE-NIGHT 67 
Celeste is lying in a quiet, dark room in thai fisherman pants and a large t-shirt. She takes a deep breath. 
CELESTE So where do you live? 
They smile at each other. 
CUT TO: 
ECU OF 
Jesse, Skillz and Tucker with their arms up, cheering loudly. 
70 EXT. FAIRFAX HIGH- CHEERLEADING PRACTICE-DUSK 70 
Jesse, Skillz and Tucker are taking in a high school cheerleading practice, drinking tall boys and smoking cigs. Despite their ragtag appearance, do not be fooled...They are very loyal and knowledgable supporters. 
SKILLZ Oooh...toe touch basket toss coming up...degree of difficulty 9. Gnarly.......nailed it! Way to go, Becky!!! 
Jesse is look at his iPhone. He is looking at "Veronica and Jesse Baby Registry" 
JESSE What the fuck is a Baby Bjorn? 
SKILLZ It's a very, very tiny Swedish man. 
TUCKER It's a baby carrier that allows your child to benefit from parental intimacy without the confinement of a stroller. Duh. 
JESSE Why do you know that. 
TUCKER Beth. We go to a lot of baby showers. 
SKILLZ I put a lot of babies in the ladies. 
A parent of a cheerleader looks at trio with disgust. Jesse is still going through the registry list. 
JESSE Birthing towels, breast pump, Diaper genie? Fuck, I'm definitely having a baby. (beat) How's Celeste? 
SKILLZ She's...oh-kay. I'm fine-tuning her cannibus levels right now, just trying to find the right balance. 
JESSE Celeste doesn't smoke pot. 
SKILLZ She does now. She loves it. 
Jesse takes this in. Tucker changes the subject. 
TUCKER How's Veronica? She's so sweet. 
JESSE Yeah, less sweet pregnant but it's probably just hormones. 
TUCKER But are you into it? 
JESSE Yeah, I really like her. She seems great. For someone that I don't really know that's having my baby. 
"California Love" by Tupac (or whatever song we clear) comes on and the cheerleaders start a routine. 
SKILLZ MY JAM! 
Skillz stands up and starts breaking it down. He's not that good. Committed though. Jesse and Tucker continue to talk. 
TUCKER Are you scared? 
JESSE A little. Yes. 
TUCKER That's great. You should be. Just keep saying "yes." I'm really proud of you. 
Skillz looks at his cell phone. He shows Jesse a text from Celeste that reads, "I need green. Now." 
SKILLZ She's like my top client now. 
71 INT. CELESTE'S HOUSE-LATE NIGHT 71 
Celeste is home from her date with Paul and is now obsessing on Jesse's Facebook page. His status reads "in a relationship." She's drunk and this makes her sad. Oh, there's a video. It's of Jesse and Veronica. Jesse presents Veronica with a cake, she laughs and blows out the candles. They kiss. Crushing. Confusing. Her doorbell rings. 
CUT TO: 
72 INT. CELESTE'S HOUSE-A COUPLE MINUTES LATER 72 
The door opens to reveal Skillz. He holds up a bag of weed. 
SKILLZ Step out of the shadows and into the light. Are you crying? 
CELESTE I don't know what I'm doing. Dating is stupid and all of a sudden, my ex-husband bakes cakes? It's probably fucking gluten-free. 
SKILLZ What? 
JESSE Yeah, yeah. It's great. 
Why doesn't he seem happier? He knocks back the rest of the drink. 
JESSE (CONT'D) (CONTD) I should probably get home. 
CELESTE Yeah. It's really nice to see you. 
He hugs her. Tight. They breathe together. They hug tighter. He pulls away, looks at her and kisses her for one second, very tenderly. She pulls away. 
CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) You should go. 
JESSE Can we just...lay here for a bit? 
Celeste lays down and Jesse spoons behind her on the couch. They hold each other. There's a long drag of silence. 
JESSE (CONT'D) (CONTD) I can't believe I'm having a baby...and it's not with you. 
We see Celeste's face but Jesse doesn't. She's crying. 
77 INT. CELESTE'S LIVING ROOM- THE NEXT MORNING 77 
The phone rings. It's early. Celeste, still in her clothes from the night before, wakes up. Jesse is gone. She fumbles for the phone. 
CELESTE Yeah. 
SCOTT We have a massive problem on our hands. I need you in the office. Now. 
78 INT. POP FORM OFFICES-LATE AFTERNOON 78 
INSERT of a large, magnified version of Riley's "RB" logo. It is pretty clear what the image looks like. Scott stares at Celeste, waiting for her to freak out. 
CELESTE I don't see anything. 
SCOTT (referring to the logo) It's a penis. And a butt. 
CELESTE What? Really? I don't see it. 
SCOTT You can't be serious. (points to the logo) There's the penis. And there's the penis going into the butt. 
CELESTE I think it's a stretch. 
SCOTT Well, it's not a stretch, Celeste. 
Scott puts a DVD into the DVD player. A reel of news clips comes on. 
NEWSCASTER ...teenagers were hoping to get a little bit of the teen star's fashion magic but instead, they have been suprised by what they saw. 
PARENT There's homosexual butt sex in the logo. Does Riley think we're that stupid?? I will never support gay marriage. 
NEWSCASTER Neither Riley nor a representative from Pop Form-the marketing company responsible-could be reached for comment. 
Scott turns it off. 
SCOTT Celeste, what did you do. How could be so careless? 
Celeste picks up the magnified logo again. 
CELESTE Oh. Oh my God. Oh wow, I totally see it now. WOW. Ha. Haha. Hahahahaaha. 
Celeste starts laughing uncontrollably. It's the funniest thing she's ever seen. 
CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) It's a cock in a butt!!! Hahahaahaaa!! 
SCOTT (fuming)Stop it. Stop laughing. 
CELESTE Scott, come on... 
SCOTT No, this is not a joke. Our company's in serious danger. 
CELESTE You're being dramatic. 
SCOTT Get out. I can't, with you, right now. I have to deal with this. I'll call you soon. 
Her laughter fades and she exits the conference room. 
79 EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD.-LATER THAT DAY-DUSK 79 
Bon Iver's "Skinny Love" plays as Celeste walks slowly amongst the celebrity impersonators, tourists and drunks on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. 
Celeste bursts in with all types of nervous energy. 
CELESTE The thing is, I have been having a really hard time in my life, everything is sort of falling apart and when you said that thing about contempt and investigation, it just sort of hit a nerve and... 
RILEY Just, shut up for a minute. 
Riley is in tears. 
RILEY (CONT'D) (CONTD) I just found out my boyfriend cheated on me. 
CELESTE Oh. God, I'm sorry. I didn't even know you had a boyfriend. 
RILEY Nobody knew. He didn't want anybody to know. Fucking ass hole. And now, my career might be over because you put a penis in my logo. Thank you for that. 
Riley is clearly destroyed. 
RILEY (CONT'D) (CONTD) I didn't know who to call. 
Celeste gives Riley a big hug. 
CELESTE So you called the smartest person you know. 
Riley smiles through her tears. 
CUT TO: 
87 INT. RILEY'S HOUSE- HOLLYWOOD HILLS-LATER THAT NIGHT 87 
Riley is asleep on the couch with a blanket over her. Celeste is up, watching "Great Sports Moments of 2008" on ESPN Classic. 
It is a recap of Matthias Steiner's Olympic weight lifting triumph after his wife died. Jesse's favorite. Celeste is crying. This wakes Riley up. 
RILEY Are you crying? 
Celeste turns off the television. 
CELESTE Oh, yeah, this just reminds me of someone. 
RILEY A guy? 
CELESTE Yeah. A guy. 
RILEY You miss him? 
CELESTE Yeah, I do. 
RILEY They all fucking suck. 
CELESTE Kind of. 
RILEY So it never gets better? 
CELESTE No, it doesn't. But you do. You're gonna be fine. 
88 INT. DRY CLEANER'S-MORNING 88 
Celeste is runs into a dry cleaners. She is out of breathe. The long line of impatient people to see this dragon breather who has broke the silence. She looks at her watch. She stands diligently in line. 
Celeste's phone rings loudly. She picks it up. 
CELESTE Hi...I know I won't...no I'm on the road already! Near...Bakersfield? Of course I'll be there...love you too. 
She hangs up and was clearly lying. She must do something. Something she does not want to do. She looks at the stoic woman in front of her. 
CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) I'm so sorry but I am the maid of honor and I am supposed to be at the wedding real far away, would you mind if I just got in front of you?... 
The woman reluctantly waves her to pass. 
CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) Thank you so much, I really do appreciate...sir? 
A disinterested man barely acknowledges Celeste. 
CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) I'm incredibly late for this wedding and my dress is here, is there any way... 
He moves aside. The next man just stares at her. 
CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) Hi. I'm sure you heard me ask the last guy but... 
The camera pulls out. A wide shot of Celeste, imprisoned by her own rules, asking every person to cut. It looks tedious and ridiculous. 
98 EXT. RUNYON CANYON-MORNING 98 
Celeste is hiking alone on the phone, energized. 
CELESTE Tweens don't want her anymore. But the gays do! Ten percent of Americans are gay, Scott. You're gay, start thinking gay. Gay Izod. She could be Lady Gaga by the end of the year. Huge market. 
SCOTT Wow, you might have just turned the cock in the butt around. 
CELESTE We WILL make the cock in the butt work for us. The cock in the butt will be huge! 
Just then, a mom and two small children walk by her, overhear her dirty mouth and glare at her. She waves at them self- consciously. 
MONTAGE OVER SHUGGIE OTIS' "INSPIRATION INFORMATION": 
A98 SHOT OF CELESTE, PAUL, BETH AND TUCKER EATING DINNER AT A98 LOTERIA MEXICAN RESTAURANT. PAUL IS TELLING A STORY-HE IS ANIMATED AND CONFIDENT. CELESTE LOOKS AT HIM, SLIGHTLY EMBARRASSED. A MOMENT LATER, BETH AND TUCKER ERUPT IN LAUGHTER. CELESTE SMILES.

99 INT. TARGET-AFTERNOON 99 
Celeste is shopping for a dresser. She is talking to a salesperson. 
SALESMAN So, it comes with directions and it's actually really easy to assemble. 
CELESTE Look, you do not know me. I do not want to assemble. Trust me, you do not want me to assemble. Bad things happen. Could I just take the floor model? I'll hook you up. 
SALESMAN Lemme go ask my manager. 
CELESTE Thanks, dude. 
Celeste is browsing and spots Veronica with a shopping cart filled with baby stuff. She approaches her. 
CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) Veronica? Hey, Celeste. 
VERONICA Of course, yeah, hi! What are you doing? 
CELESTE Oh, I'm getting a dresser. You? 
VERONICA Oh, you know getting... 
VERONICA (CONT'D) CELESTE Baby stuff. Baby stuff. 
VERONICA (CONT'D) (CONTD) Beth is uh...throwing me a baby shower? So I have to register. 
CELESTE She is? 
Celeste swallows this. 
CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) That's uh...really nice. 
VERONICA Very. And so helpful right now. 
CELESTE Of course. (laughs nervously) Well, looks like you're really organized. 
VERONICA Organized, terrified. 
CELESTE You'll do great. 
VERONICA Thanks. I hope so. 
They share an awkward moment. 
VERONICA (CONT'D) (CONTD) Listen, I never got a chance to just tell you I'm so sorry about all this. Trust me, I didn't expect... 
CELESTE No, don't. Really. There's nothing to apologize for. I'm the one who's sorry. I mean, I dug through your trash. 
Celeste laughs. 
VERONICA Look, I don't blame you. For anything. This has all been so weird. Everything happened really fast. 
CELESTE Yeah, it did. But everything will work out. I know it. Jesse's book is coming out... 
VERONICA He's so talented. 
A beat. 
CELESTE Yeah, he is. 
CELESTE What? 
PAUL You're only ready when you're ready, you know? Don't force it. It's just some yoga shit. 
CELESTE Thanks. 
PAUL But I do like you. I like you a lot. And when you are ready, if you're ready, call me. 
101 INT. STEIN, WEINBERG, STEINBERG & JIMENEZ LAW FIRM - 101 AFTERNOON 
Celeste and Jesse sit across from each other with their respective lawyers. They are both dressed very well. The atmosphere is formal, tense. There is not a lot of talking but there is a lot of loud paper shuffling and ball point pens. CELESTE'S LAWYER, male, 40, speaks: 
CELESTE'S LAWYER Sign here. And here. And here. 
Celeste looks up, makes eye contact with Jesse and smiles uncomfortably. 
CELESTE'S LAWYER (CONT'D) (CONTD) And here. Here. Yup. Aaaaaand here. Here. Couple more. Here... 
Celeste is still signing. She looks at Jesse again, who is straightening his tie. 
CELESTE I like that tie. 
JESSE Oh, thank you. 
CELESTE'S LAWYER One more here. 
CELESTE Is it made out of organic mung beans? 
Jesse nods and chuckles. 
JESSE No, I actually found it digging through your trash. 
CELESTE Ohhh, I see. All right. 
They've broken the tension. But it's still silent. Then Jesse chortles. It sounds like a baby pig. It makes Celeste laugh. 
Now, both Celeste and Jesse are silently cracking up, doubled over as their lawyers sit there, watching them, perplexed. 
102 EXT. STEIN, WEINBERG, STEINBERG & JIMENEZ LAW FIRM - 102 A LITTLE LATER 
Celeste and Jesse walk out of the building. 
JESSE So...we're divorced! 
They high five. What are you supposed to do when you get divorced. 
CELESTE We did it. 
JESSE You wanna walk for a couple minutes? 
CELESTE Sure. 
CUT TO: 
103 EXT. LACMA- SUNDOWN 103 
Celeste and Jesse are now approaching the front of "Urban Light," the installation from the beginning of the movie. The street lamps are now illuminated. She takes a seat on a step. Jesse sits next to her. She refers to the lamps: 
CELESTE These are beautiful. 
JESSE I thought you hated them. 
CELESTE Yeah, well, I've never seen them at night. 
Jesse looks at the lamps and takes them in. He looks pretty sad. 
CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) What's up with you? I know we just got divorced but no one died, right? 
JESSE I'm just feeling like maybe you were right. I am a fuck up. I don't know what I'm doing. My girlfriend left. 
There is a long pause. 
CELESTE What? Veronica? Left where? 
JESSE Left me. She wanted me to tell her everything was gonna be okay and I couldn't. I don't know why but I just...couldn't. She wants to go back to Brussels. 
Another monumental pause. Jesse's eyes start tearing up. 
JESSE (CONT'D) (CONTD) Okay, you can say it now. You were right, I blew it. Just say it.

LISA I'll help out if I can. 
CHARLIE (SHEEPISHLY) Actually, I don't know... this is kind of a personal question. 
LISA That's okay. Go ahead. 
CHARLIE Alright. Just for the sake of argument, if I wasn't a happily married man... am I the kind of guy you'd go out with? 
LISA Oh, um... I don't know. (PAUSES) Well... yeah. I guess I would. 
CHARLIE Lisa, I have terrific news for you. 
LISA What? 
CHARLIE I'm not married! Is this perfect or what? Listen, there's not a lot of women willing to come right out like that and admit they're attracted to a guy, but... 
Lisa SLAPS Charlie, turns on her heel, and marches off. 
CHARLIE (CONT.) Jeez... make up your mind. 
Stanley gives Charlie the fish eye as he returns. 
CHARLIE Okay. Bad example. Some of these women got so much baggage they need an emotional sky cap. I'll tell you what Stanley, tonight I'm gonna take you on a love safari, deep into the darkest heart of the urban jungle. 
STANLEY And where's that? 
CHARLIE The Monkey's Paw. Hottest new club in town. It's a guaranteed skirt alert and no dead beats allowed. 
STANLEY So how are we gonna get in? 
CHARLIE Woah, do I detect a little self-image problem there, buddy? You just leave everything to me. This, my friend is going to be the perfect night on the town. 
Suddenly a resounding peal of THUNDER rings out like the crack of doom. Sheets of rain pour down on the bank's windows. 
EXT. STREET 
Pedestrians scramble for cover in the sudden downpour. 
INT. BANK - FOYER 
A young woman scurries into the bank holding a newspaper over her head. She's soaking wet and pauses in the foyer to straighten herself out. 
Charlie immediately notices her... 
CHARLIE Hold the phone. Killer at three o'clock. 
Stanley follows his gaze. 
STANLEY'S P.O.V. 
CAMERA does a classic CHEESECAKE TILT-UP starting with the woman's million dollar legs as she squeezes some of the water out of her skirt... up past her body, which through her damp summer clothes is undeniable proof that there is a God... up... up... to her face as that newspaper is tossed aside. She's a heart-stopping woman/child with a Cupid's bow mouth and ice blue eyes. In other words she's trouble. Big trouble, also known as TINA CARLYLE. 
Charlie may as well have just seen the Virgin of Guadalupe. 
CHARLIE (hushed reverence) Oh my god... A perfect dime. The dame of dames. The Moby of my dick. 
STANLEY Easy Charlie. You'll sprain your eyes. 
Tina now enters and walks towards Stanley and Charlie. 
TINA Excuse me, where can I open a new account? 
Charlie flashes his best 100 watt smile. 
CHARLIE You've come to the right place, ma'am. Just step right this way and pull up a chair... 
Charlie tries to steer Tina to his desk, but she's still preoccupied with her damp clothing. 
TINA Oh, I'm sorry. I'm a complete wreck. Will you hold this please? 
She hands her shoulder bag to Stanley and peels off her wet blazer, creating another awe-inspiring visual moment. 
CHARLIE Here, let me take that for you. 
Charlie clutches her jacket with white knuckles. 
TINA Thanks. 
But Tina turns and sits at Stanley's desk; Charlie is stunned at his near miss, but there's not a thing he can do about it. 
STANLEY So, uh, what kind of account did you have in mind? 
TINA (smiles sweetly) Well, I'm not sure exactly. I'm just terrible with things like that. That's an interesting tie Mr...? 
STANLEY Ipkiss. Stanley Ipkiss... 
Tina extends her hand. 
TINA Tina Carlyle. Pleased to meet you. 
STANLEY The, uh... pleasure's all mine. 
Tina notices a box of Kleenex on Stanley's desk. 
CHARLIE You heard me. How much you got? 
STANLEY I dunno, fifty or sixty bucks. 
CHARLIE Hand it over. 
STANLEY No way. 
CHARLIE Hey, I'll pay you back! I'm only carrying plastic. C'mon man, you want to stand out here all night? 
Stanley begrudgingly starts to count out some cash. Charlie snatches the whole wad and elbows his way back around to the ropes. 
CHARLIE (subtly flashing bills) Hey Bobby! 
Bobby's uncanny tip radar suddenly lights up. 
BOBBY Charlie, how you doin' man? Long time no see. 
Bobby unsnaps the rope for Charlie and gets the cash handshake he longs for. 
The crowd surges around Charlie, Barbie and Pebbles as they step by, briefly cutting Stanley off. 
He catches up just as the all-important rope is SNAPPED closed. 
STANLEY Hey, wait a minute! Charlie! 
But Charlie and the girls have already been whisked inside. Dorian now steps out of the club and begins to check Bobby's list. 
STANLEY (CONT.) I'm with them! Hey, Bobby! 
But Bobby is back into his deaf and dumb routine. Stanley unsnaps the rope himself and starts throgh. Bobby and BOUNCER #2 IMMEDIATELY grab Stanley and quickly subdue him. 
STANLEY Hey! Leggo... awk! 
Dorian glares at Stanley. 
DORIAN Lose him. 
The bouncers drag Stanley through the crowd and unceremoniously toss him out into the rain-slick street. 
ANGLE ON THE STREET 
Stanley slowly rises, smoothing out his disheveled clothing. A horn BLARES and Stanley scrambles to one side as a limo swings into the club's alleyway, splattering him with a wave of muddy water. 
Stanley wipes the mud from his eyes just in time to see Tina Carlyle escorted from the back of the limo by a CHAUFFEUR carrying an umbrella. She's shoe-horned into a heart-stopping red dress that's fighting a losing battle to restrain her decolletage. 
Their EYES MEET. Tina pauses as she recognizes him. 
TINA (SMILES) Oh... Stanley. Hi. 
Stanley realizes he looks ridiculous but gives a pathetic little wave hello anyway. 
TINA (CONT.) Are you okay? 
Stanley gestures "no problem" and tries to strike a casual pose against a street lamp, but slips and nearly falls. 
With a SQUEAL of grinding gears and the KA-POW of a backfire, the car hop pulls Stanley's battered loaner right up behind him. 
Stanley flashes a last nervous smile at Tina, and digs for the car hop's tip money... nothing. 
He shrugs apologetically to the disgusted car hop and climbs in. The car RATTLES, COUGHS the finally ROARS off in a cloud of NOXIOUS exhaust fumes. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. TAHOOCHIE BRIDGE - NIGHT 
A forlorn looking spot on the outskirts of Edge City. We can hear Stanley's car SPUTTERING and POPPING along before it actually pulls into sight on the dark rain-slick street. 
INT. CAR 
Stanley drives along in a miserable daze. Suddenly the engine starts KNOCKING violently and the car dies. 
EXT. BRIDGE 
Steam HISSES from the radiator as the car slowly rolls to a stop. Stanley GRINDS the ignition key again and again trying futilely to restart the engine. 
Finally, Stanley fights his way out of the rusted door with a SQUEAL of metal, turns and kicks the bumper... which promptly falls off with a resounding CLUNK. 
Beat. 
The front axle collapses, the tires fall off and the driver's side door CLATTERS to the ground. 
Stanley stands there staring at the steaming heap of useless metal... his mind a complete blank. 
He slowly turns, looking down at the black brackish water swirling along beneath the Tahoochie Bridge. A wave of melancholy sweeps over him. Stanley plucks a button from his coat and watches as it drops down... down to the river below. 
Suddenly, something catches Stanley's eye... a BODY, floating along in the darkness. He snaps back to reality. 
STANLEY (CONT.) Hey... Hey mister! 
EXT. RIVER BANK 
Stanley rushes down the slippery embankment beneath the bridge. He spots the body dead ahead, floating along in the moonlight and HURRIES as fast as he can. 
STANLEY Thanks Officer. 
The black and white pulls away and Stanley starts across the empty street. 
VOICE Hey, mister... 
Stanley turns. 
A razor-cut DEATH'S HEAD PUNKER hops down from a fire escape in a darkened alleyway. 
DEATH'S HEAD You a cop or something? 
A half dozen other DEATH'S HEADS appear out of the shadows all decked out in nipple chains, tattoos and other self-mutilation- AS-FASHION oddments. 
STANLEY Uh... no. They just gave me a lift. 
DEATH'S HEAD A cop chauffeur? I never seen that before. How about you boys? 
The other Death's Heads pipe up with "Not Me," "Nope," "Pretty special," etc. as they slowly surround Stanley. 
STANLEY Alright, you guys. It's been a tough night. I haven't got any money. I haven't got a car. All I have is this and you're welcome to it. 
Stanley tosses Death's Head #1 the Mask. 
He briefly inspects the funky looking antique, still slick with river slime, then tosses it back. He approaches Stanley. 
DEATH'S HEAD Hey, man. You got us all wrong. We don't want any trouble. I was just going to ask you for the time. That's all. You got the time? 
STANLEY Uh... yeah. 
As Stanley pulls back his sleeve to check his watch, the Death's Head flicks out a butterfly knife. With a FLASH of steel, he slices straight through Stanley's watch band and snatches the watch. 
DEATH'S HEAD (holding up his prize) See, I only wanted the time! Heh, he, heh... 
All the punkers laugh like the half-wits they are as Death's Head #1 shoves Stanley into Death's Head #2. #2 pushes him back across to #3 and so on. Stanley is roughly bounced back and forth more and more violently within the circle of giggling street toughs. He finally breaks free and scrambles to his front door, still reeling with dizziness. He fumbles with the key and SLAMS the door behind him as the Death's Heads roar with laughter. 
CUT TO: 
INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT 
Stanley's wet shoes SQUEAK as he tiptoes past - 
APARTMENT "A" - MANAGER 
A sign that reads "Quiet Please" hangs from the doorknob. Stanley continues past it to Apartment "B". Just as he removes his keys - THE Manager's door flies open and MRS. PEENMAN appears. She's an old dragon in hair curlers who will probably live forever just to spite her relatives. 
MRS. PEENMAN Ipkiss! Do you have any idea what time it is? 
Reflexively, he looks at his (now empty) wrist. 
STANLEY Actually, no. 
MRS. PEENMAN It's three o'clock in the morning! First, you wake up the entire building laughing it up with your pals. Then, you come in and start squeak - (sees puddles) My new carpet! Just look at that! This is coming out of your cleaning deposit Ipkiss! 
Stanley, battered, bruised and soaking wet is deep in urban shell-shock. 
STANLEY (SOFTLY) Are you done? 
MRS. PEENMAN ...Yes. 
STANLEY I think I'll be going to bed now. 
Mrs. Peenman SLAMS her door. 
INT. STANLEY'S APARTMENT - CONTINUES 
Small, full of books but very neat. A few cherished animation cels from 1940s cartoons are framed on the wall. As Stanley locks the door behind him - he's greeted by MILO, a happy little terrie sized mutt with a big heart. 
STANLEY Hello, Milo. 
Milo gets so excited he starts GAGGING and COUGHING. 
STANLEY (CONT.) Easy, buddy. I missed you too. 
Stanley pats Milo on the rump, crosses his tiny kitchenette and heads straight into... 
THE BEDROOM 
Stanley's prized collection of "golden Age" Looney Tunes tapes are neatly displayed on a simple bookshelf. 
He tosses the Mask down on his bedside table, pops one of his cherished Tex Avery cartoons into the V.C.R., plops down on his bed and starts to strip off his shoes and socks. 
MILO 
enters, holding a Frisbee in his mouth. 
STANLEY (CONT.) C'mon, Milo. I'm beat. (to the dog YIPS) Okay, okay. One throw. 
Stanley tosses the Frisbee into the air. The disk sails... 
OUT OF THE BEDROOM AND INTO THE HALLWAY 
Milo runs it down, leaps up, and makes a perfect catch. He trots back to the bedroom, and drops it in Stanley's lap. 
Trying to ber VERY, VERY quiet, the Mask tiptoes down the darkened corridor. The floor makes a barely audible CREEEEK as the Mask steps with exaggerated care pst APARTMENT "A" with it's little "Quiet Please" sign. He raises a finger to his lip, making the "SHUSH" sign. 
Suddenly - and unexplicably - a ringing ALARM CLOCK leaps out of Stanley/Mask's pocket and starts jittering down the hall. 
STANLEY/MASK O, jeepers--! 
Stanley/Mask tries to snag the clock, but it bounces away every time. Frustrated, he pulls a full sized SLEDGEHAMMER from his pocket and starts POUNDING the floor in an effort to stop the clock. Glancing blows shatter the clock face and most of the works, but those bells just keep ringing. 
The hammer, of course, slams craters the size of manhole covers into the floor and reverberates through the building like THUNDERBOLTS. 
The door bursts open and Mrs. Peenman's angry face pops out covered in blue mud pack and framed in curlers. She gets one look at the Mask with his oversized carnival mallet raised over his head and SCREAMS bloody murder. 
The Mask SCREAMS in response, his eyes bugging out on stalks and his mouth expanding to the size of a tuba in mock horror. 
Mrs. Peenman's door SLAMS shut and reopens a beat later as she appears cocking an enormous shotgun. 
MASK Easy lady! I was just killin' time! 
The Mask starts ricocheting off the walls HOOTING maniacal laughter as Mrs. Peenman lets loose with both barrels. KA-BOOM. 
The Mask bounces off walls as Mrs. Peenman continues to blast away, and finally leaps straight out the window. KEE-RASH. 
EXT. APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Sending his body SAILING our through the air towards the street seven stories below. 
STANLEY/MASK AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH- 
EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT 
SPLAT. Stanley/Mask lands face up in the middle of the street. He slow... painfully starts to rise as a STREET CLEANING machine turns a corner and RUNS DIRECTLY OVER HIM. The machine disappears down the street as we HOLD on Stanley/Mask's flattened body. 
He raises one arm, grabs himself by the head and peels himself off the street. He shakes himself out with one sharp CRACK and straightens his zoot suit. He's shocked to find a tiny SPOT on his sleeve. 
STANLEY/MASK Hey! You missed a spot! 
As if on cue, a SECOND street cleaning machine SLAMS into him and RUNS OVER HIM AGAIN. This time he reinflates himself back into 3- D by blowing into his thumb and hops up. 
STANLEY/MASK And next time, no starch! 
Fully recovered, Stanley/Mask starts down the street, strutting like a prize fighter. 
VOICE Hey mister... 
Death's Head punker #1 hops down from his fire esscape behind the Mask. 
DEATH'S HEAD #1 (grins evilly) ...You got the time? 
The Mask turns to see he is surrounded by the Death's Head punkers. He seems to be delighted by their presence, but now that they see his face, they're totally freaked. 
MASK (wiggles eyebrows) Why of course, Cubbie. I got all the time in the world! 
He whips out his forearm (which grows large for emphasis cartoon- style). It's covered with crazily spinning watches, CHIMING cuckoo clocks and sun dials. 
MASK London, Paris, Rome, standard, substandard and no standards at all! And for our English friends we have... Big Ben! 
DEATH'S HEAD #1 Big Ben? 
Stanley/Mask KICKS a nearby street post, snapping it in half and sending a large decorative street clock PLUMMETING into the sidewalk. KA-BONG! It completely obliterates Death's Head #1. The other gang members jump back in shock as the Mask races around the corner. 
DEATH'S HEAD #2 Get him! 
The Death's Heads pull out nasty homemade weapons and race around the corner into the alleyway. 
INT. ALLEY 
They come to a screeching halt as they discover Stanley/Mask dressed as a carnival barker. Multicolored lights and Calliope music come from out of nowhere. 
MASK And for my next trick... 
Long pink and blue balloons appear in Stanley/Mask's hands and he instantly goes into a frenzy of twisting and knotting them into AN elaborate balloon sculpture. SQUEAK. SQUEAK. SCREECH. 
The Death's Heads are too stunned by the severe weirdness of all this to do anything but stand there and stare. (These guys were no rocket scientists in the first place.) 
MASK (CONT.) And viola! We have a giraffe! 
Sure enough, he's created a first rate balloon sculpture. He hands it to the biggest, dumbest Death's Head, who grins like a little kid upon receiving it. 
The Mask instantly goes into another flurry of motion, sculpting more balloons. SCREECH POP. 
MASK (CONT.) A few more twists of the wrist and for you, Cubbie. 
He hands this next prize to Death's Head #3. 
MASK (CONT.) A French poodle! And finally my favorite... 
He goes into another flurry of motion. 
E.C.U. - BALLOON 
As the Mask pulls the ends of the knotted balloon, it straightens out and MORPHS into... 
MASK (CONT.) A Tommy gun! 
INT. STANLEY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAWN 
Stanley slowly awakens. He grabs his head and moans, looking and feeling completely hung over. Then suddenly he remembers - and JUMPS out of bed with a start. 
He looks in the mirror, touching his face. It's the same old Stanley. He looks at his paisley PJ's. Same old PJ's. 
He picks up the mask. Same old mask. 
STANLEY A dream... It was only a dream. 
Stanley starts to relax. There's a KNOCK at the door. 
INT. HALLWAY - DAWN 
Stanley's greeted by LT. KELLAWAY (50). This hound-dog of a cop can't help but stare at Stanley's garish pajamas. 
LT. KELLAWAY Nice PJ's pal. 
STANLEY Can I help you? 
LT. KELLAWAY You're Ipkiss? Stanley Ipkiss? 
STANLEY That's right. 
LT. KELLAWAY Some kind of prowler broke in and attacked Mrs. Peenman. 
STANLEY (swallows hard) Really? I didn't hear a thing. 
LT. KELLAWAY Then you must be a pretty sound sleeper, Ipkiss 'cause she unloaded a couple rounds of 20 ott buckshot five feet from your door. 
Kellaway swings Stanley's door open wider to give him a better view of the damage. Mrs. Peenman stands there in the hall tearfully speaking to anither OFFICER. 
Stanley is flabbergasted to see: 
QUICK CUTS 
C.U. - The shotgun blasts in the walls. 
C.U. - The pot holes left from the mallet. 
C.U. - The shattered remains of the wacky alarm clock. 
All flashbacks from last night! 
STANLEY (GASPS) That's... impossible! 
LT. KELLAWAY Excuse me? 
Stanley quickly pulls himself together. 
STANLEY That's... a, possible. See, I have this inner ear problem. (wiggles a finger in his ear vigorously) Sometimes I can't hear a thing. 
KELLAWAY (SKEPTICAL) Is that a fact? 
STANLEY What? 
Kellaway leans closer to speak more loudly, but catches himself and shoots Stanley a dirty look. 
KELLAWAY Forget it. 
He hands Stanley his card. 
KELLAWAY (CONT.) Here. You remember anything unusual about last night, anything at all, call me. 
STANLEY Sure... thanks. 
Stanley SLAMS the door and throws his body against it, his heart pounding in his chest. Milo gives him that curious dog-head-cocked-sideways look. 
STANLEY (CONT.) Milo, it was real! How could it all be... real? 
Stanley suddenly notices the clock on the wall. 
STANLEY (CONT.) Oh my god. I'm late! 
He races into the bedroom. 
INT. HALLWAY 
Kellaway is taking notes as patiently as he can from Mrs. Peenman. 
KELLAWAY Look, Mrs. Peenman, you gotta admit your description is pretty tough to swallow. 
MRS. PEENMAN Then you can choke on it for all I care. I saw what I saw. 
KELLAWAY Right. (refers to notes) A green head the size of a pumpkin, purple zoot suit and spats. That's a pretty serious fashion risk for any self-respecting second story man. 
An OFFICER now hurries up the steps all out of breath. 
OFFICER Lt., we just got an emergency call from a mechanic on 67th Street. 
KELLAWAY What? 
POLICEMAN Some kind of assault and battery. Sound pretty bad. 
Chralie flips open the Entertainment section of the Evening Star. There's a great close-up of Tina singing her heart out with the HEADLINE "Bombshell Explodes at Monnkey's Paw." 
MR. DICKEY, the smarmy office manager who is younger than Stanley, now appears. 
DICKEY Ipkiss! You're forty minutes late! Every time you do that you're robbing this bank of its time and money! 
STANLEY Sorry, Mr. Dicky. It won't happen again. 
DICKEY (snatches newspaper) If you weren't so busy ogling girlie pictures you'd get some work done around here. 
CHARLIE Ah... She's a prospective client of Stanley's, sir. 
DICKEY (sudden attitude change) She is? Well... Next time she comes in see that you send her directly to my office. 
STANLEY Yes sir, Mr. Dickey. 
Dickey tosses the paper back on Stanley's desk and marches off through the bank. 
CHARLIE Look at that little creep. If it wasn't for his daddy he'd be out somewhere shakin' down school kids for lunch money. 
Stanley toys with the Kleenex that bears Tina's lipstick "kiss". 
STANLEY You think she ever will come back, Charlie? 
CHARLIE Who knows? Forget about her, Stanley. A dame like that is always looking for the B.B.D. The bigger better deal. Ask her what her sign is and she'll say dollar. 
STANLEY You don't know that. She's an artist. Maybe she's sensitive. 
CHARLIE Yeah. She can sense a guy's credit line at two hundred yards. Stanley, you need a girl you can depend on. Someone a little more down to earth... someone like... 
ANGLE ACROSS THE BANK 
as Peggy Brandt stops by a teller's window, looking sharp and pretty in a blazer and jeans. 
PEGGY Excuse me, can you tell me where I can find Stanley Ipkiss? 
BACK TO CHARLIE 
CHARLIE Like her! Someone like her. (straightens tie) As a matter of fact I could use someone like her myself. (rises as Peggy approaches) Hel-lo there. May I be of some assistance? 
PEGGY Stanley Ipkiss? 
Charlie begrudgingly points to Stanley. 
PEGGY (CONT.) Hi. I'm Peggy Brandt. I'm with the Evening Star. 
STANLEY Oh, hi. I already have a subscription, thanks. 
PEGGY Oh no, actually I just wanted to ask you a few questions. 
STANLEY Really? About what? 
PEGGY Ripley Auto Finishing. You're a customer of theirs aren't you? 
STANLEY I... uh. No. I think you must have made a mistake. 
Peggy produces one of the complaint slips. 
PEGGY Isn't this a form of theirs you filled out? 
STANLEY (nervous chuckle) Oh, that Ripley Auto. I guess I have stopped in there once or twice, Miss... what did you say your name was? 
PEGGY Peggy Brandt. 
STANLEY Wait a minute... Peggy Brandt of "Ask Peggy"? 
PEGGY That's right. 
STANLEY (brightens up) You printed my letter last year, remember? "Nice Guys Finish Last." 
PEGGY You're Mr. Nice Guy? Stanley do you realize how much mail we got about that letter? There's hundreds of women out there who are looking for a man just like you. 
STANLEY Are you serious? 
PEGGY Of course. DO you know how hard it is to find a decent man in this town? Most of them think monogamy is some kind of wood. 
STANLEY Why are you covering this story? 
PEGGY They cut my salary. I just can't make it by on "Dear Peggy" anymore. The truth is, I want to be a real reporter and if I can break this story I know they'll let me. (sits closer) Look Stanley, I know Ripley Auto is a crooked operation. They may even have had ties to the Mob. I'm not out to get you. I just want the truth. 
STANLEY I wish I knew the truth, Peggy. I really do. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. MONKEY'S PAW ENTRANCE - AFTERNOON 
A well dressed MAN checks from beneath his sunglasses to see nobody's watching and RAPS on the door. It opens and he quickly DISAPPEARS inside. 
INT. DORIAN'S OFFICE 
Sweet Eddy escorts him inside. The man removes his glasses and glances about nervously. Dorian sits at his desk. Dr. Freeze and Chun Woo are going over an array of high tech burglary equipment laid out on the air hockey table. 
DORIAN Good afternoon, Councilman Snell. Nice of you to drop by. 
THE MASK 
Through his bedroom window, propped up on the fourth story ledge. Its leering grin seems to beckon Stanley as we begin to hear the POUNDING beat of the Mask F.X. theme. 
STANLEY 
stands transfixed, staring at the moonlit face. He can almost hear echos of faint whispered VOICES calling his name. A deadly siren song above the pounding drums. 
STANLEY (SOFTLY) No... 
He backs away from the window. 
E.C.U. - THE MASK 
shimmers as the WHISPERS grow louder. 
STANLEY 
takes a last look at the crumpled picture of Tina in his hand and finally loses control. He bolts from the room. 
EXT. BALCONY - NIGHT 
Stanley is a driven man as he makes his way out onto the narrow ledge. Milo tugs at his pajama leg, but Stanley kicks him away and climbs out over the ledge. 
THE LEDGE 
Stanley wavers precariously on the crumbling masonry, then catches his balance. His face is bathed in sweat as he gazes at the leering face. F.X. music THUNDERS in his head. 
THE MASK (faint echos) Stanley... Stanley. 
Stanley tries to steady himself, his eyes transfixed on his prize. 
STANLEY Just... one... last... time. 
He lurches back out and makes his way one shaky step at a time towards the mask. 
MILO 
watches from the apratment window, whimpering softly. 
C.U. - THE LEDGE 
Narrow masonry begins to crumble. 
STANLEY 
carefully reaches down, his fingers just brushing the mask as he teeters out over nothingness. Night traffic whizzes by down below. 
THE MASONRY 
cracks away. 
STANLEY 
SCREAMS as he begins to fall, jamming the mask to his face. 
INT. APARTMENT 
The window suddenly EXPLODES inwards as the whirling Stanley/Mask tornado bursts into the room. Milo dives for cover. 
The tornado scorches the rug as it wheels around the room, then SCREECHES to a halt, revealing the Mask in his full glory. He strikes a grand entrance pose with his arms held high. 
MASK (SINGS) I gotta be me! I just gotta be me! 
He ZZZIPS into the bathroom 
INT. BATHROOM 
The Mask sticks the picture of Tina on the bathroom mirror and blows her a kiss. 
MASK (a'la Big Bopper) Oooooh Bay-bee. I knoooooows what you likah! 
He sprouts a couple of extra arms as he madly brushes his teeth, sprays on cologne and bats himself with a powder puff all at once. 
He ZZZIPS into the bedroom. 
INT. BEDROOM 
The Mask stands before a full length mirror and checks himself out. With a magical "hands are quicker than the eye" move, he CHANGES wardrobe instantly... now posing in an effete fashion victim Don Johnson-style suit. 
MASK The G.Q. look?... Naw. 
In a TWINKLING he's changed again: now in MTV Rapper-style over- sized jeans and backwards baseball cap. 
MASK (CONT.) 501's? (shakes his head) For buttonheads only. 
He changes again in a flash... This time he's naked except for his Calvin Klein underwear (his stomach muscles appear super-cut washboard-style). 
MASK (CONT.) Marky Mark, eat your heart out. 
He changes one last time and appears in a wild banana yellow zoot suit complete with a snap brim fedora. That's the ticket! 
MASK (CONT.) S-s-s-mokin! Now let's see... 
BOBBY Er, uh... Are you on the list? 
THE MASK No, but I believe my friends are. (fans a wad of cash) Jackson, Lincoln and Roosevelt. 
He tosses a handful of loot in the air and struts into the club as the crowd scrambles for the cash. 
INT. MONKEY'S PAW 
This is the first time we've gotten a good look at the place and it's a real eyeful. CAMERA BOOMS DOWN TO REVEAL its wild tropical DECOR complete with live exotic birds in huge indoor Banyon trees. WAITRESSES in leopard skin leotards make their way across the crowded dance floor with trays full of oversized tropical drinks. 
CAMERA ENDFRAMES as the hostess seats Dorian at his favorite ringside table and removes the "reserved" sign. The lights dim an all eyes go to the bandstand. 
ANGLE OF THE BANDSTAND 
A spotlight hits the stage and tropical ferns part like a gigantic fan revealing... 
TINA CARLYLE 
in a glittering gown that's made of little more than sequins and mesh. If there were such a thing as fashion police this dress would be arrested for disturbing the peace. 
She talks/sings the intro of her number a capella. 
TINA There's all kinds of men In this old world That seek the affections Of a beautiful girl. 
But of the men from Which to choose There's only one type That I... ap...aprooove. 
And now the band slides in, in classic torch song style as Tina sings "Checks Appeal". She works the room throughout the song, driving the men crazy as she lingers by each table. 
TINA (CONT.) You can keep your cowboys on the farm The gigolos don't make me warm It's mink my fingers crave to feel I need a man with checks appeal. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
The Mask is seated at a table on the other side of the club and immediately reacts when he lays eyes on Tina. 
His eyes BUG OUT on stalks, an AHOOGA horn sounds and his heart starts POUNDING wildly, shooting two feet out of his chest with EACH beat. Customers at nearby tables are astonished. 
TINA (CONT.) Pretty boys are such a bore There's manly macho types galore But you'll always know The diamond's real If you've got a man with checks appeal. 
The Mask snatches a bottle off a passing WAITRESS' tray and sucks it down in one gulp. His head VIBRATES like an electric paint shaker. WWWOOOING! He CLAPS both hands on his head to hold it still. 
DORIAN'S TABLE 
Sweet Eddy looks nervous as hell as he appears beside Dorian. 
DORIAN What the hell are you doing here? 
EDDY We got trouble. You better come upstairs. 
Dorian immediately rises and hurries through the corwd towards his office. 
ANGLE ON THE MASK 
as he continues to ogle Tina. His face now elongates into a wolf's. He HOWLS, WHISTLES, pounds his fist on the table and stomps his foot on the floor. 
TINA Don't want to see too fanatic But dollar signs are so romantic I want a love That's deep and real Just with a man that's got... (big finish) Checks ap-peaaal. 
The audience goes crazy. Tina takes a bow. 
Suddenly the Mask ZZZIPS around the perimiter of the club, leaps up on top of the piano and SNAPS his fingers. A spotlight hits him. 
THE MASK Let's rock this joint! 
He grabs the stuffy, tuxedoed PIANIST'S stool and spins it hard. When the pianist stops twirling, he been transformed into a hip, BEATNIK BE-BOPPER who immediately starts pounding out a mean BOOGIE- WOOGIE. 
The Mask produces a conductor's baton from thin air, spins around and magically whips the rest of the band into a frenzy, WAILING out a driving rock 'n roll tune. 
Satisfied with the music, the Mask leaps down onto the dance floor, grabs the astonished Tina and drags her off her feet into a wild special FX JITTERBUG. 
THE CROWD 
watches amazed as... 
THE MASK AND TINA 
put Fred and Ginger to shame. Jiving away at warp speed, the Mask movves like a combination of Gumby and Barishnikov. He SHOOTS TINA beneath his legs, SNAPS her back into midair, SPINS her like a baton and hits the floor in the splits without missing a beat. 
THE MASK S-s-s-smokin! 
CUT TO: 
INT. DORIAN'S OFFICE 
Dorian and Sweet Eddy enter to find Dr. Freeze, sitting there, gasping in pain with a bar towel pressed against a bloody wound in his side. 
DORIAN What the hell happened to you? 
FREEZE I'll be okay. Nobody puts the chill on Freeze. 
DORIAN Where's the money? 
FREEZE Deal went south, Bro'. Someone else hit the place before we did. 
DORIAN Who? 
A hockey goalie bats the bullet away. 
A Russian Dancer leaps over the shot. 
A Cowboy DING! takes the hit. 
The Mask staggers back... the forwards in a classic Western death scene. He throws an arm around Sweet Eddy for support. 
MASK Ak... you got me Pahdnuh. (cough... cough) 
Eddy seems touched by the Mask's dying words as he holds him in his arms. 
MASK (CONT.) Hold me close, Red. It's a gettin' dark. (COUGH) Tell Auntie Em to let Old Yeller out. (cough... cough) Tell Tint Tim I won't be makin' it home for Christmas. (COUGH) Tell Scarlet I do give a damn... I... I... UUG! 
And the Mask gives up the ghost, his pink tongue flops out the side of his mouth. Eddy bursts into tears. 
Suddenly a huge cartoon AUDIENCE pops up silhouetted in the foreground, applauding wildly. An off-camera ARM shoots into frame handing the Mask an Oscar. 
The Mask leaps to his feet and starts taking bows. 
THE MASK (CONT.) Thank you! You love me! You really love me! 
Dorian pulls out his own .45 and opens fire. 
The Mask starts HOOTING laughter and ricochets off the dance floor. 
Dorian gives chase, but suddenly the nightclub doors are KICKED OPEN and Kellaway and a squad of police burst into the room with THEIR guns drawn. 
KELLAWAY Drop it, Tyrel! 
Dorian lets his .45 CLATTER to the ground. Kellaway retrieves it. 
DORIAN Hello, Kellaway. You got a warrant or did you just drop by for a night cap? 
KELLAWAY I got probable cause. A couple of your boys were spotted knocking over Edge City Bank. 
One of his men begins to roughly frisk Dorian 
DORIAN Easy, junior. You're givin' me a woodey. 
KELLWAY One of them was wearin' some kind of big green mask. 
DORIAN For once you're on the right track, but that's not one of my men. Maybe you ought to try a little actual police work instead of this harassment bullshit. 
KELLAWAY This isn't harassment. You want to see some harassment? (to his men) Search the place, boys. 
His men begin to tear the club apart. 
DORIAN Ever wonder why you didn't make Captain, asshole? I got friends so high up they'd give you a nose bleed. 
Kellaway hauls off and CRACKS him in the face with a solid right cross. 
KELLAWAY Well what d'ya know? I guess they gave you one too. 
Dorian shakes it off and glares at him. 
DORIAN (SOFTLY) You're a dead man. 
One of the officers now appears on the stairway. 
OFFICER Lt., we got a stiff upstairs. One of the guys from the heist. 
KELLAWAY (cuffs him) Better call that high-priced lawyer of yours, Tyrel. You're comin' downtown. 
DORIAN I'll be back on the streets before sunrise and you know it. 
KELLAWAY Then just think of this as the city's way of showing you a little hospitality. (pats him on the cheek) I'll stop by to tuck you in myself. 
As the police drag Dorian outside, Kellaway notices someting on the dance floor. 
CLOSER 
Kellaway picks up the slice of pajama fabric that was once the Mask's tie and inspects it closely... It's the same fabric Kellaway saw Stalney wearing that morning. 
EXT. CLUB 
Kellaway exits and walks right past the poster of Tina. Flattened into the poster, with his arm around her, is a cartoon of the Mask. The eyes follow Kellaway as he speaks to TWO COPS guarding the door. 
KELLAWAY You're on your own, boys. 
COP Don't worry, Lt. If he's in there, well get him. 
Kellaway slips the pajamas fabric in his pocket. 
KELLAWAY And if he's not, I got a feeling I know where to find him. 
As Kellaway heads for his car, the Mask slips out of the poster (still flat as a pancake), slides along the wall behind unsuspecting policemen and around the corner to safety. 
CUT TO: 
INT. STANLEY'S BEDROOM - DAWN 
Milo GROWLS, Frisbee in mouth. Stanley wakes up with a massive headache and dark rings under his eyes. The Mask, which lies on the pillow next to him is taking a greater and greater toll. There's a BANGING on the door. 
TINA You. You're losing it Dorian. 
DORIAN I'm losing nothing. Except maybe some extra baggage I don't need around here. 
TINA What's that supposed to mean? 
DORIAN You weren't putting up much of a fight when that green goon kissed you last night. 
TINA C'mon, did it look to you like I had a choice? 
DORIAN Maybe you did and maybe you didn't, but I know this, one day real soon I'm gonna run this town and when I do there's gonna be payback for anyone who crossed me. (glares at her) I mean anyone. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BANK - DAY 
The place is in general disarray but still functioning, jammed with worried depositors. Stanley makes his way to his desk, his face pale and unshaven. Dark circles ring his eyes. 
MR. DICKEY Ipkiss! We have a crisis on our hands here and you stroll in over an hour late. If I have to put up with your slovenly... 
Stanley develops an odd facial TWITCH, then... 
STANLEY (EXPLODES) Back off Monkey-Boy, before I tell your daddy how you're running this branch like it's your own personal piggy bank! If the I.R.S. saw some of those files we could arrange a little vacation for you at Club Fed! 
Dickey is absolutely shocked into silence by this outburst, then... 
MR. DICKEY That will be all, Ipkiss. 
Dickey turns on his heels and exits. Charlie Schumacher now appears glowing with new respect for Stanley. 
CHARLIE Woah! What side of who's bed did you wake up on? 
STANLEY I'm not sure. (TWITCHES) I haven't exactly been myself lately. 
For a split second, Stanley's entire face CONTORTS into an alarming Mask-like expression. 
CHARLIE (WARILY) Yeah, well you look like you could use a little R and R there buddy... and as a matter of fact I've got just the ticket. Or should I say tickets? 
STANLEY I'm afraid to ask. 
Charlie flashes two tickets. 
CHARLIE Saturday night. Grand opening of the Valhalla Casino. Serious skirt alert. Everybody who's anybody will be there. What do you say? 
STANELY I don't know Charlie, I... 
Stanley suddenly spots Tina making her way across the room to his desk. 
STANLEY (CONT.) Excuse me a second. 
ANGLE ON STANLEY'S DESK 
STANLEY Tina... What are you doing here? 
TINA I heard about the robbery. I guess I just wanted to make sure you were okay. 
STANLEY Oh, don't worry about me. (TWITCHES) I'm fine. 
TINA Are you sure? You look a little... 
STANLEY I'm just having a little trouble sleeping is all. (BEAT) I guess you won't want to open that account after all this... 
TINA I'm not so sure I'll have much to open an account with anymore. 
STANLEY What about the nightclub? I thought you were doing great. 
TINA I don't know how much longer I can stay there Stanley. Things are getting a little intense. 
STANLEY Well, there must be plenty of other places you could sing. Maybe even get a record deal... 
TINA I wish it was that easy. There's thousands of girls out there just like me who... 
STANLEY Not just like you. You've got a voice like... like an angel. 
TINA (lights a cigarette) An angel huh? That's the first time I've heard that one. 
STANLEY No, I mean it. You really do. 
TINA I can vamp my way through a tune. But that's not really singing. 
STANLEY What is it with you, Tina? Why don't you believe in yourself? 
TINA (SIGHS) I guess I've just heard a lot of promises from a lot of guys. In the end they all wanted the same thing and it wasn't a song. 
STANLEY So maybe you've been singing for the wrong guys. 
TINA I'm not so sure there's any other kind. Not for me, anyway. (RISES) Well, I'm glad nobody got hurt. 
STANLEY Yeah. 
TINA What about this guy, the Mask? Do the cops have a line on him? 
STANLEY I'm not sure. Why are you interested? 
PEGGY How do I find this Tyrel? 
FIGURE Careful, sweet meat. You break this story and he just might find you. 
CUT TO: 
C.U. DORIAN 
as he enters... 
EXT. JORGENSON'S SMORGASBORD - AFTERNOON 
Dorian and Sweet Eddy casually step through the front door of the restaurant's ersatz chalet facade. 
INT. SMORGASBORD 
Sweet Eddy takes a position by the door as Dorian greets Artie the Swede at a large oak table in the festeively decorated SMORGASBORD 
The Swede is flanked by his gunsels as he's served by a big blonde waitress in a classic peasant girl costume. 
SWEDE Dorian... thanks for coming by, kid. 
DORIAN My pleasure, Swede. It's been too long. I was worried you were still pissed about that little thing with Harry the Hat. 
SWEDE That? It was nothing. He was a pain in my ass anyway. Here, sit down, sit down. 
DORIAN Congratulations on the new casino. 
SWEDE Thanks, but it might be a little early to celebrate. As a matter of fact that's why I asked you to stop by. 
DORIAN Is that right? 
SWEDE Here... have a little something to eat. That's Svenska meatballs, kid. The real thing. 
DORIAN Thanks. 
Dorian starts to eat. 
SWEDE So, I tell you Dorian, it's a terrible shame. I put all my hard work into this beautiful casino and what do you think? All the sudden I got all kinda problems with the city. Big problems. The whole deal could fold. 
DORIAN Maybe I can help you out. I'm expecting to come into a little investment capital shortly. If worse comes to worse and you really need to bail out... 
SWEDE What a sweet guy. Isn't this guy a sweetheart? Thanks for the offer Dorian, but I think maybe I can solve this myself. 
DORIAN Is that right? 
SWEDE That's right. You know that Councilman you got in your pocket? 
Dorian freezes with a forkful of meatballs halfway to his mouth. He notices a PINK CARNATION squashed into the gravy. 
SWEDE (CONT.) Well now you've got 'im in your mouth. How you like that? 
The Swede and his men have a good laugh as Dorian spits out his meatball. The Swede pulls a gun and jams it under Dorian's chin. 
Sweet Eddy goes for his gun, but one of the Swede's men pops up, jamming a barrel to his temple. 
SWEDE (CONT.) (to Dorian) Now listen close scumbag! You want to bw in business with me? Okay, we're partners now. I'm takin' fifty per cent off the Monkey's Paw. You screw with me again and I'll send you straight down to Hell with your scumbag councilman. You can apologize for eatin' him for lunch. 
DORIAN Sure, Swede. Take it easy. 
SWEDE Good. Now get out of my sight. 
Dorian rises. 
SWEDE Oh Dorian, here's a couple tickets to my grand opening. Stop by. And try to dress up nice. It's good for business. 
CUT TO: 
CLOSE ON: NEWSPAPER HEADLINE 
"The Mask Robs Bank - Police Scour The City." It's accompanied by a grainy blow-up of the Mask from the bank video. 
A HAND 
jams a quarter in the slot, opens the machine and pulls out the entire stack of papers. 
WIDER 
to reveal Stanley, still looking pale and desperate as he dumps the entire stack of papers in a nearby garbage can. 
He starts to turn away when he notices an ad on the back of the paper for a book... "The Masks We Wear" by Dr. Arthur Neuman, the SAME man we saw interviewed on "The Larry King Show." The byline reads "The Mysterious Powers of the Identities Within Us." 
Stanley rips out the ad and hurries off down the street. 
CUT TO: 
INT. PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE - DAY 
C.U. - MASKS... Dozens of them line one wall. Tribal masks. Victorian masks. Ceramic masks. Masks from all countries and cultures. 
WIDER 
Stanley paces the plush office like a caged animal while Dr. Neuman sits nearby toying with his pipe. 
OLIVERAS (V.O.) You want us to pick him up? 
LT. KELLAWAY Don't do a thing until I tell you. Just keep the SWAT team standing by. If this guy's half as bad as he's supposed to be we'll need all the help we can get. 
LT. KELLAWAY 
fires up his engine and pulls away. 
EXT. PARK - SUNSET 
Topiaried ivy reads: "Welcome to Peninsula Park." A small sign below that reads: "No dumping." 
Carrying his briefcase, Stanley enters the park. 
EXT. BENCH 
Stanley passes through a stand of trees and nearly bumps into Tina. 
TINA Stanley, what are you doing here? 
STANLEY Oh, Tina... Hi. You're early. 
TINA A little. 
STANLEY I just... wanted to make sure you two got together okay. 
TINA That's nice. (sits down) You know, I hardly ever stop by here. It's hard to believe it was just a garbage heap. 
STANLEY (looking at the sky) It's always beautiful at sunset. Those methane emissions really pick up the colors. 
TINA Wow. They really do. All those pinks and greens. 
STANLEY Well... I'm sure my cousin will be along any minute. He never shows up anywhere 'till after sundown. He's sort of strange that way. (RISES) I guess I'll get going. 
TINA No, Stanley. Stay for a second. I was thinking about what you said and I, uh, I want you to know I appreciate it. Maybe you're right. If I believed in myself a little more I wouldn't rely on guys like Dorian. 
STANLEY Dorian... You mean Dorian Tyrel? 
TINA Yeah. He's sort of my manager. 
STANLEY Tina, you've got to be careful of that guy. He's a dangerous criminal. 
TINA You really mean that, don't you? 
STANLEY Absolutely. You ought to hear the stories... 
TINA No, I mean, you're really worried about me. That's... real sweet, Stanley. 
STANLEY C'mon, Tina this is serious. How involved are you with this guy? 
TINA I can take care of myself, Stanley. I always have. 
STANLEY Oh, really? People close to Tyrel have a nasty habit of turning up dead, or haven't you noticed? 
TINA Look, this may sound a little cold but I do what I have to do to get by, okay? I'm nobody in this town without Dorian. 
STANLEY And who are you with him Tina? I'm not exactly sure who I am anymore but at least I'm trying to find out. If you really had any faith in yourself, you wouldn't be hanging on to some kind of free ride. 
That last bit stung, and Stanley knows it. A shadow falls over them as the last rays of the sun disappear behind the clouds. 
STANLEY (CONT.) (SIGHS) I'm sorry Tina. I guess I better get going. 
Stanley gets up and hurries off through the trees. 
TINA (RISES) Stanley... wait! 
But he's already disappeared. Tina starts to follow after when she hears a strange WHOOOSH. A whirlwind begins to kick up the leaves all around her. 
The Mask leaps out from behind a stand of trees in all his glory and literally sweeps her off her feet. With his lower lip thrust out he romances Tina in a deep syrupy French voice. 
THE MASK Cher! Ce moi! Je'taime, Je' taime, Je any old tame! At last we are together mon petite bon bon! 
ANGLE ON THE BUSHES 
Kellaway, Doyle, and two other officers are watching from a distance. He speaks into his walkie talkie in hushed tones. 
KELLAWAY This is Kellaway. I need back up and I need it now! Every available man down to Peninsula Park. 
INT. NEWSROOM - BULLPEN 
MURRAY, an old timer newshound hurries into the room, grabs his notebook and pulls on his coat. 
MURRAY Looks like it's gonna be a long night. My wife is gonna kill me. 
PEGGY What is it, Murray? 
MURRAY The cops got your pal Ipkiss staked out at Peninsula Park. We just picked it up over the police band. 
PEGGY Let me cover it, Murray! You go on home to Claire. 
MURRAY I don't know, Peggy. Ramsey said... 
PEGGY (grabs her coat) I'll take care of Ramsey. Thanks a million. I owe you one. 
Stanley/Mask looks around, like he's trying to figure a way out of this mess - then - 
STANLEY/MASK Hit it! 
With that, a police SPOTLIGHT SNAPS on, and the brightly lit park entry-way becomes a beautifully lit stage. Stanley/Mask strikes a pose, now wearing a straw hat "boater" and weilding a cane. 
Pedestrians with radios and ghetto blasters look down in shock as a RUMBA begins playing from every speaker in town. Stanley/Mask SWAYS seductively in time to the music. 
A FEMALE COP steps forward, a look of surprise spreaading over her face as, against her will, she opens her mouth in song. 
FEMALE COP They rave about Sloppy Joe - the Latin lothario - but Havana - has a new sensation. 
It's "Cuban Pete RUMBA" by Desi Arnaz! (Yes, this is a real song!) 
FEMALE COP (CONT.) He's really a modest guy - although he's the hottest guy - in HavAAAAna - and here's what he has to saaaay - 
Stanley/Mask steps up to the "stage" and tilts the boater over his eyes, casting a sly glance toward the crowd. 
STANLEY/MASK ("Latin" voice) They call me Cuban Pete - I'm King of the Rumba beat - every time I play the maracas I go chick chick chickie boom! 
Gene Kelly on acid, Stanley/Mask punctuates his number with any number of sly gestures - winking, nodding, sliding seductively down a street lamp post, doing repeated "splits" on the sidewalk - it's his big number! 
The cops watch this with open mouthed astonishment. 
ANGLE ON STONE WALL 
Kellaway climbs over two of his men to scale the wall. He can't believe his eyes. Doyle clamors up beside him. 
DOYLE Hey, he's not bad. 
Kellaway shoots him a dirty look. 
STANLEY/MASK 
waltzes into the street, prancing just inches from the heavily armed cops. His legs twine around each other like spaghetti, then his upper torso SPINS until they're straightened out again. 
STANLEY/MASK (still singing) Yessir, I'm Cuban Pete! The craze of my native street! When I start to dance everything goes chick chick chickie boom! 
Like some weird, loony case of mass hypnosis, Stanley/Mask waits for the "musical break" to coax the armed cops into JOINING him on the number - as the rough and tumble equivalent of CHORUS GIRLS! 
ANGLE - LOOKING DOWN FROM HELICOPTER 
The street takes the look of a Busby Berkeley musical as the cops HIGH STEP in time to the infectious RUMBA beat. 
EXT. STONE WALL - NIGHT 
Kellaway leaps/tumbles down from the wall into some bushes and scrambles to his feet. He can't believe his eyes. His cops, his tac squad, his friggin' SWAT team - they're ALL in the street, dancing with this crazy maniac! 
Stanley/Mask sidles up to a heavily armed female SWAT officer, "dirty dancing" her across the street - 
STANLEY/MASK The senoritas they sing, and how they sling their sombreros --! (It's very nice! So full of SPIIIIICE--) (dip!) And when they're dancing they bring a happy ring to their vaqueros - they sing their song, all the day loonnnggg - 
Doyle crash lands beside Kellaway and starts out to join the others, but Kellaway grabs him by the back of his jacket. 
KELLAWAY You go out there and I'll blow your brains out! 
Furious, Kellaway yanks open the door of an abandoned squad car, pulls out a tear gas gun and fires into the air. The sharp REPORT AND stinging gas seems to break the spell of THE MASK. The music suddenly STOPS and the high stepping cops stagger away from the CHORUS line, looking confused. 
LT. KELLAWAY (CONT.) Goddamn it! Arrest that thing! 
The cops - shaken back to reality - fumble for their weapons. 
THROUGH THE SMOKE 
The Mask takes off - dashing into the crowd. 
KELLAWAY 
spots the Mask and races after him, calling his men. 
KELLAWAY (CONT.) This way! 
THE MASK 
bumps into an OLD LADY who SCREAMS at his hideousness. 
The Mask realizes how obvious he is. He turns away and brings his arms to his head. There's a RIPPPING sound. And when he turns around, the Mask has now transformed back into... 
STANLEY 
Carrying the mask, Stanley tries to blend in with the crowd. 
KELLAWAY 
followed by a handfull of officers bears down on him. 
KELLAWAY Halt! Halt or we'll shoot! 
Stanley quickly cuts down... 
A NARROW ALLEY 
Stanley races down the lane - cops hot on his trail. Bullets EXPLODE all around him. Just as he reaches the next street... 
Dorian/Mask wheels about and ROARS at Sweet Eddy. 
DORIAN/MASK DO AS I SAY! I have other plans for Ipkiss. Everything's become so clear to me now! 
Peggy sheepishly reaches for the suitcase. 
PEGGY Ah... excuse me. If you don't mind, I'll just take my money and be going. You guys make yourselves at home. 
Dorian/Mask slides up to Peggy threateningly. 
DORIAN/MASK Must you go? What a shame. You and I could make beautiful headlines together. 
Peggy removes his arm from her shoulder. 
PEGGY Thanks, anyway. That wasn't part of the deal. 
Peggy snatches the briefcase, but Dorian/Mask blocks her exit. 
DORIAN/MASK Of course. You only want what's coming to you, don't you? 
Peggy whips out a snub-nose .38 out from beneath her coat. 
PEGGY Back off Freakazoid. I wasn't born yesterday. 
DORIAN/MASK Ah... But you might die today! 
Dorian throws the switch and the presses CHURN to life. In a flash he snatches Peggy off her feet. 
DORIAN/MASK (CONT.) A girl like you deserves to have her face plastered all over page one. 
He tosses her into the grinding mill of steel and paper. 
CAMERA BOOMS DOWN as Peggy's feet disappear between the presses' huge rollers and continues down, down past the whirling gears and hydraulics to finally ENDFRAME on the chute where the newspapers roll out on a conveyor belt. 
Headlines in blood red ink now read: "Reporter Killed in Freak Accident" next to a picture of a slightly flattened-looking Peggy, her mouth open in a silent scream. 
SWEET EDDY What do we do with Ipkiss? 
DORIAN/MASK The police are looking for the Mask. We shall give them the Mask. And Eddy... 
SWEET EDDY Yeah, Dorian? 
DORIAN/MASK Get the boys ready. The Swedes' expecting us at the casino opening tomorrow night. We wouldn't want to disappoint him, would we? 
Dorian/Mask throws his head back and lets loose a deep BOOMING LAUGH. It's unnerving even to Eddy, but he laughs nervously in RESPONSE and elbows the other thugs to join in. 
CUT TO: 
INT. STANLEY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
The door is kicked open and two of Dorian's henchmen burst into the room. Milo leaps off the couch and scrables behind the curtains. They yank open the closet door and start scooping the cash into plastic garbage bags. 
EXT. STREET - CAR 
Stanley lies in the back seat, gagged, bound hand and foot and half hidden under a blanket. A thug in the driver's seat pokes his .45 under Stanley's nose. 
THUG That money better be where you said it was, Ipkiss or you can Ipkiss your ass goodbye. 
He chuckles at his own little joke. 
INT. APARTMENT 
Milo peeks out from behind the curtain as the henchmen finish their job. He ducks behind the curtain and looks out the window. 
MILO'S P.O.V. 
of the henchmen's car. Stanley can barely be seen peeking out the car window. The henchmen pushes him back down. 
MILO 
His ears perk up. The boss is in trouble! He checks back outside the curtain. 
THE HENCHMEN 
finish up and start out the door carrying the trash bags. Milo races right by them, just out of sight. 
EXT. STREET 
The henchmen hop in and start the engine. As the car peels out into traffic, Milo appears, valiantly racing along the sidewalk, DODGING pedestrians and cross-traffic to keep the car in sight. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT 
Dejected, Lt. Kellaway heads up the steps with Sgt. Doyle. 
LT. KELLAWAY I still can't believe it. Hardened cops dancin' in the streets... and broadcast all over the ten o'clock news. 
DOYLE The SWAT team got an offer to open for Wayne Newton. 
LT. KELLAWAY I'm history. The Captain's going to have my badge for breakfast. With a little pension on top. 
DOYLE C'mon Lieutenant, it wasn't your fault. Something will turn up. 
TINA (CONT.) --kiss. 
They KISS. A sweet, soft and romantic kiss. Then... the KEY-GUARD pulls her away. 
KEY-GUARD Time's up, lady. 
TINA I've got to disappear for awhile Stanley. I'm not sure where I'll go but I'll let you know as soon as I can. 
Stanley takes a long last look at Tina as she's escorted out. 
EXT. STATION - DAY 
Warily, Tina slips out of the precinct. She's about to cross the street, but spots a SUSPICIOUS LIMO, engine idling. Quickly, she doubles back and heads - 
INTO THE ALLEY 
Behind the station. She looks over her shoulder. No one's there. Tina hurries toward the next street and - 
A BIG SEDAN 
roars up, cutting her off. She turns and runs back the way she came - but freezes when THE LIMO screeches up, blocking her. 
Sweet Eddy and Hicks jump out of the limo. She SCREAMS. 
INT. STANLEY'S CELL - AT THE WINDOW - SAME TIME 
Stanley watches helplessly as Tina is dragged into the limo. Frantic, Stanley runs to the cell door. 
STANLEY (to the Key-Guard) Hey! A girl's being kidnapped out there! Do something! 
THE GUARD tunrs up the volume on JEOPARDY, drowning Stanley out. 
EXT. DORIAN'S HOUSE - DAY 
A slick/modern house on the hills overlooking Edge City. Sweet Eddy pulls Tina from the limo. 
INT. DORIAN'S HOUSE 
Sweet Eddy and Huey enter and push Tina roughly into the room. Dorian rises to meet her. 
DORIAN (SARCASTICALLY) Baby, there you are... (he embraces her) I was gettin' all worried about you. 
TINA I just went out for a little while Dorian. 
Sweet Eddy holds up a small suitcase and an overstuffed shoulder bag he got from her car. 
DORIAN Looks like maybe a long little while, right baby? 
Dorian grabs her by the throat and SLAMS her against the wall. The pictures rattle. 
DORIAN You know what happened to the last bitch that ran out on me? Do you?! 
TINA (CHOKING) No... 
DORIAN Nobody else does either. Nobody ever will. 
He tosses her onto the bed. She lies there gasping for breath. 
DORIAN Now fix yourself up, baby. And pick out something pretty to wear tonight. 
Dorian picks up the mask and admires it. 
DORIAN (CONT.) We're going to make a big splash at that opening. One this town will never forget. 
CUT TO: 
INT. JAIL CELL - DAY 
Agitated, Stanley paces around the room. Stanley's eyes pop open. An IDEA! He stands up, clunking his heaad on the upper bunk. STANLEY peers down the hall and sees 
THE KEY GUARD 
watching a TV boxing match. He's CHEWING on the leather key-chain strap. There's a half eaten sausage and a wedge of cheese on the desk. 
STANLEY 
climbs up on the cot and looks out the window. 
STANLEY (stage whisper) Milo! 
EXT. THE ALLEY - SAME TIME 
Just a pile of trash. The dog's gone. Then... a RUSTLE. A filthy blanket moves... and MILO emerges from it - tail waggling as he sees Stanley. 
The little dog jumps up, helplessly trying to reach the window. 
STANLEY Come on, boy! 
Milo gets an idea. He jumps on boxes and trash bags, using them as steps. He climbs higher and higher until he's reached the top of the dumpster. 
STANLEY (CONT.) Come on, Milo! 
Milo jumps from the dumpster. He almost reaches the window, but falls back down again into the trash heap. 
INT. KITCHEN 
The Thug enters, brandishing his gun and cautiously makes his way into the kitchen. 
C.U. - FOOT 
He steps into a large slick of olive oil and his legs shoot right out from under him. SLAM. 
THUG'S P.O.V. 
as he slides across the kitchen floor at high speed. 
THUG Whoaaaaa! 
Suddenly Stanley pops up from behind the overturned barrel with a huge frying pan and slams it right into camera. CLANG. 
STANLEY 
plucks the gun from the unconscious Guard and sneaks into the casino. 
INT. CASINO 
Stanley appears out of the kitchen doors and gets the attention of the nearest captive party-goers. 
STANLEY Pssst. You guys. Over here. 
Charlie turns around. 
CHARLIE Stanley! What are you doing here? 
He motions them over to the kitchen and hands Charlie the gun. 
STANLEY Start sneaking people out the back. Watch out for the oil. 
Stanley now makes his way deeper into the casino. 
EXT. PARKING LOT - POLICE CAR 
Milo finally manages to pop the lock and the car door opens. He scurries off towards the casino. 
INT. CASINO 
The Swede struggles desperately as he's tied to a spoke of a huge wooden NUMBERS WHEEL, a kind of upright roulette wheel that's one OF the casino's attractions. Mayor Tilton and two other town dignitaries are tied to the other three spokes. 
SWEDE Let me offa this thing, you lousy scumbag! 
Dorian/Mask pulls three Viking hand axes off a wall display and casually begins to juggle them. 
DORIAN/MASK Sorry Swede. I've got an ax to grind with you. In fact I got a couple and I'm afraid they may give you a splitting headache! 
He nods to one of his men who gives the wheel a big spin. As the captives SCREAM Dorian prepares to throw his first ax. 
DORIAN/MASK (CONT.) Round and round she goes. Who dies first, nobody knows! 
ANGLE ON THE VIKING SHIP 
Stanley pops up behind the dragon-prow and starts untying Tina. 
TINA Stanley! 
STANLEY Hang on, Tina. 
TINA Stanley, look out! 
Stanley ducks just as a Viking ax splits the dragonhead right next to him in half. 
Dorian ROARS with rage as he rushes across the room to the boat. 
Stanley pops back up firing his gun. BLAM. BLAM. BLAM. 
Dorian takes the direct hits. He grins horridly at Stanley and he extends his slimy tongue. 
C.U. - TONGUE 
The bullets all stand there on end in a neat little semi-circle. 
Dorian now sucks in a mighty breath. Stanley grabs a Viking shield and protects Tina and himself. 
Dorian blows the bullets back at Stanley. 
RAT-TAT-TAT-TAT. 
They batter the shield. Stanley's knocked backwards from the impact. 
A HUGE GREEN CLAW 
drags Stanley out and SLAMS up against the prow next to Tina. One of his men immediately begins tying Stanley in place. 
DORIAN/MASK How touching! The two love birds. Just to show you there's no hard feelings, I'm going to let you spend the rest of your lives together. 
TINA You've got it all wrong! I could care less about this creep. Nobody could replace you, Dorian. Nobody! 
DORIAN/MASK If you think a line like that's going to save your life, you're dumber than he is. 
STANLEY 
burns through his ropes. He frees himself and races to the detonator. 15 - 14 - 13 - 12 
IN THE MAZE OF SLOT MACHINES 
Dorian stalks Dog/Mask, whistling for him to come. A stream of WATER now trickles down on him from above. 
Dog/Mask is in the chandelier taking a whiz and snorting doggie laughter. Dorian sprays the ceiling with gunfire, but... 
DOG/MASK 
pounces on Dorian, knocking him flat, then races out of sight. 
VIKING SHIP 
Stanley yanks one wire after another, but the timer still ticks down -- 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 -- Stanley pulls the last wire. The timer stops. Tina exhales, relieved, as Stanley unties her. 
TINA (kissing him) You did it... 
C.U. - TIMER 
as it TICKS back to life... 2 - 1 - 0! 
A muffled EXPLOSION rumbles from beneath the floorboards. 
EXT. THE PIER - NIGHT 
The two front support pilings BLOW UP. 
INT. CASINO - SAME TIME 
The entire floor TILTS. Gaming tables and slot machines start to slide by. Stanley grabs Tina and hangs onto the prow of the boat. 
STANLEY Milo! Milo, come! 
Dog/Mask appears racing up the tilting floor and leaps into the boat as... 
THE LAST TWO PILINGS BLOW UP! 
The entire casino floor drops straight down. 
THE SHIP SLIDES 
straight across the gaming floor towards the huge front doors. 
DORIAN 
SCREAMS as the boat slides right over him. 
EXT. HARBOR - NIGHT 
The Viking ship CRASHES through the doors and SPLASHES down in the marina as the entire casino sinks into the water. 
EXT. VIKING SHIP - NIGHT 
It bobs for a moment, then floats! Stanley, Tina and the dog emerge from their hiding place, under one of the dining tables. 
They can't quite believe they're alive. Their faces reflect romantically from the light of the Viking torch sconces. 
TINA Stanley... we made it. We're alive! 
Milo lets loose a happy "Whoof!" and leaps into Stanley's arms. Stanley removes the mask with a SCHWOOP and Milo transforms back into a regular dog. 
DORIAN I'll take that. 
They turn as DORIAN clamors over the side of the boat. He's got a gun pointed right at them. 
Stanley slides an iron grappling hook through the mask's eye holes and holds it overboard. 
STANLEY Hold it right there or you'll be looking for this on the bottom of the harbor. 
Dorian stops in his tracks. 
DORIAN Drop it and I'll kill you all. 
STANLEY You can have it. But she gets to go. 
DORIAN Fine. 
TINA Go where? 
STANLEY Swimming. We're still close to shore. 
DORIAN Five seconds, Ipkiss. 
Stanley tosses a wooden barrel overboard and turns to Tina. 
STANLEY Go ahead. Hurry... 
Tina takes the dog and slips overboard. Dorian moves in. 
DORIAN Okay. Put it down. Right over there.

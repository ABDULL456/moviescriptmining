SHOOTING SCRIPT 
July 19, 1978 
FADE IN : 
1   EXT SPACE (S)                                                1 
An ever expanding infinity of light and color as CAMERA 
TRAVELS THROUGH deep space, MOVING DIRECTLY for one pinpoint of light: a STAR GROWING RAPIDLY as we SWEEP TOWARD IT, a normal white star SUDDENLY CHANGING, brightening, flaring unbelievable intensity: supernova. The CAMERA HOLDS just a moment, then MOVES on, SEARCH- ING through space, the jeweled beauty of other star systems, sparkling nebulae, swirling hydrogen clouds. STILL MOVING, then CAMERA FINDS: 
2   EXT. AREA OF LUMINESCENCE (S)                                2 
In the far distance, slowly growing in size as CAMERA APPROACHES: it resembles, vaguely at this distance, an Aurora Borealis: flaring colors from the fringes, beautiful yet ominous. It is so large, this Cloud, it can envelope an entire solar system. CAMERA CONTINUES APPROACHING the Cloud, and then suddenly, crossing our POV, a: 3   KLINGON HEAVY CRUISER (S)                                    3 
In a graceful, turning arc toward the mysterious LUMINESCENCE. CAMERA FOLLOWS this Klingon, then FINDS a second Klingon cruiser, also turning toward the Cloud, which continues to grow in size as the Klingons approach at warp speed, CAMERA CLOSING on the lead ship, until the vessel's detail can be clearly MADE OUT: lights, weaponry, power systems, identification emblazoned on the nacelles and saucer in Klingon language (and symbols). 
4   INT. KLINGON CRUISER BRIDGE (O)                              4 
Clearly alien, an ODD-SOUNDING KLAXON signaling "battle stations." Orders issued in KLINGON LANGUAGE, the KLINGON CAPTAIN and EXEC peering at an unusual bridge viewer at the huge area of LUMINESCENT HAZE directly ahead. In KLINGON DIALOGUE: 
KLINGON CAPTAIN (Give me tactical.) 
5   CLOSE - MAIN VIEWER (O)                                      5 
goes suddenly  to a TACTICAL GRID SYSTEM, showing the LUMINESCENT HAZE to be an ENORMOUS BLIP OF LIGHT ON THE SCREEN, with two TINY PINPRICKS OF LIGHT complete- ing their turn on a direct course toward it. 
6   EXT. SPACE - THE KLINGON PATROL AND THE HAZE (S)             6 
The Patrol is clearly SEEN now on the right of the bottom of the FRAME... THREE tiny ships closing on the 
steadily growing LUMINESCENT HAZE. 
7   INT. THE KLINGON BRIDGE - CAPTAIN AND EXEC (O)               7 
All eyes on the viewer that shows the ships sweeping on the Mysterious cloud. 
KLINGON CAPTAIN (In Klingonese) Visual. 
The TECHNICIAN makes the switch. 
8   CLOSE - VIEW SCREEN - LUMINESCENT HAZE (O)                   8 
growing ever larger, its flaring colors menacing, mysterious, strangely beckoning. 
9   INT. BRIDGE - KLINGON COMMAND CRUISER                        9 
The crew stands by for battle. KLINGON CAPTAIN (In Klingonese) Tactical again. Stand by on torpedoes. 
10   EAT SPACE - LEAD KLINGON VESSEL (TORPEDO HATCH) (S)         10 
sliding open, the glowing "Hell Fire" of the Photon Launch tubes, slowly revealed. 
11   VERY WIDE ANGLE - THE THREE SHIPS (S)                       11 
They are tiny, insect-like shapes moving still CLOSER to the Luminescent Cloud, so large now that it begins to dominate all space behind. 
12   INT. KLINGON BRIDGE - TACTICAL GRID - CAPTAIN AND           12 EXEC (O) 
The growing nearness and enormous size of the Cloud also reflected on the Tactical Grid, somehow more awesome by this schematic view. The Captain gestures the order to "FIRE." 
13   EXT. SPACE - ANGLE ON KLINGON VESSEL - TORPEDO HATCH (S)    13 
The BRILLIANT PHOTON BLOBS of the torpedoes spurt from the tubes. 
14   ANGLE ON KLINGON VESSEL (S)                                 14 
A deadly PHOTON TORPEDO pattern racing away from the Klingon and toward the Luminescent glow in the distance. 
15   INT. KLINGON BRIDGE - TACTICAL GRID (O)                     15 
Three torpedoes are heading directly toward the Cloud. Suddenly they glow briefly and disappear long before they reach their intended target. 
16   INT. KLINGON BRIDGE - CAPTAIN AND EXEC                      16 
incredulous that their torpedoes have disappeared without a trace. 
17   EXT SPACE - THE CLOUD - THREE KLINGON SHIPS (S)             17 
Spock's neck at an appropriate moment. Spock is staring up as V'ger THEME MUSIC fades. 
MALE MASTER (chidingly) Spock . . . ! 
Spock turns, giving a small contrite nod -- the ritual continues. 
FEMALE MASTER Here are these sands, our fore- bearers cast out their animal passions. Here our race was saved by the first attainment of Kolinahr. MALE MASTER Kolinahr: the final shedding of all emotion. 
FEMALE MASTER You have labored long, Spock. Now receive from us this symbol of total logic. 
Spock starts to kneel... the Female Master moves in, intending to put the ancient pendant around his neck. But Spock now hesitates -- he's troubled as though uncertain he deserves this symbol and waves the pendant away. Then, a faint reprise of the V'ger THEME MUSIC now causes the Female Master to look skyward. She turns from this back to Spock as she exchanges a look with the Male Masters. 
FEMALE MASTER (gestures Spock forward) Come, give me your thoughts. 
She kneels with Spock -- lays her hands on his temples in Vulcan mind-meld position. 
FEMALE MASTER (continuing) Our minds, Spock... One and together.... 
Their eyes close -- their minds meld -- then her head jerks slightly, her features change as her mind feels Spock's reactions to the V'ger consciousness. A long moment, then she opens her eyes, gets to her feet and looks down on the still kneeling Spock. Then, she casts aside the pendant she carries -- it falls into the dust. 
FEMALE MASTER (continuing; sadly) This consciousness which calls -- it stirs your human half, Spock? You have not achieved Kolinahr -- Your human emotions are not fully extinguished. (turns to the other Masters) He will not achieve his goal with us. His answer lies elsewhere. 
The three Masters leave -- Spock watches them go, his disappointment evident even in his stoic features. 
31   MED. ANGLE ON SPOCK (M. & F.P.)                             31 
CAMERA CLOSES IN on his face as we again HEAR a frag- ment of V'ger THEME MUSIC -- Spock again raises his head and peers up into the heavens. HOLD on his face a moment, then... 
SHOCK CUT TO : 
32   EXT. EARTH - AN AIR TRAM - DAY (S)                          32 
gleaming silver in the sun as it streaks TOWARD THE CAMERA POSITION and hurtles PAST. 
33   EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - HILLTOP AIR TRAM STATION -             33 DAY (M) 
From this vantage, we can SEE all of twenty-third century San Francisco stretched out before us. In the b.g., the familiar forms of the carefully preserved Golden Gate Bridge and Transamerica Pyramid Building serve as our only reminders that this is, indeed, San Francisco. 
The AIR TRAM (an anti-gravitational train flying several feet above the ground) DECELERATES sharply, settles to the ground with a whisper. 
34   EXT. TRAM STATION - CLOSE ON TRAM DOORS - DAY               34 
The doors opening, and various TRAVELERS (civilians and Starfleet personnel) leaving the tram, striding onto the platform, continuing on their respective ways. Among the departing throng: 
35   KIRK                                                        35 
in Admiral's uniform, grim, determined, moving through the throng. Now and then Starfleet officers nod re- spectfully; KIRK responds with detached formality; his mind is clearly set on something he is resolved to ac- complish here in headquarters -- whatever the cost. CAMERA WITH HIM, to: 
36   INT. AIR TRAM STATION - DAY         `                       36 
as Kirk strides into the graceful Starfleet HQ building. Many PEOPLE are about, civilians and uniformed person- nel; most of them with some air of urgency. (NOTE: ALIENS interspersed among them, Vulcans, blue-skinned Andorians, high-domed Vegans, ect.) Kirk continues on when suddenly he reacts, annoyed as he sees: 
37   SONAK                                                       37 
a Vulcan, Lt Commander; short, white-haired, grizzled, hurrying along. Kirk calls to him: 
KIRK Commander Sonak... ! 
SONAK turns with Vulcan imperturbability to face Kirk who steps toward him 
KIRK (continuing) You've received your appointment as Enterprise Science Officer? 
SONAK (nods) Based, I am told, on your recommendation, Admiral. Thank you. 
KIRK Why aren't you on board? 
SONAK Captain Decker requested I complete final Science briefing here before... 
KIRK (interrupting) Here at Starfleet...? The Enterprise is in final preparation to leave dock... 
SONAK Which will require twenty more hours at minimum, Admiral... 
KIRK Twelve! I'm on my way to a meeting with Admiral Nogura which will not last more than three minutes. Report to me on the Enterprise in one hour. 
SONAK To you, sir? 
KIRK I intend to be there following that meeting. Report to me. One hour! 
And Kirk turns, strides purposefully away. Sonak gazes after him, one eyebrow raised quizzically. 
38   EXT. EARTH ORBIT (S)                                        38 
In f.g., Orbital drydock offices, rotating slowly but perceptibly against blue-black of space. Small figures in spacesuits working on construction, with work belts. Beyond and below... Earth. In the far distance we can barely make out an orbital drydock. 
39   CLOSER ANGLE - ORBITAL OFFICE CLUSTER (S)                   39 
The cluster is a fully-equipped dockyard engineering center and computer drafting office. 
Scott completing the mating procedure, Kirk turning from the observation window. Outside, the metallic.. CLICK of the pod locking onto the airlock. Now the "WHOOSH" of the latch doors securing, the CLANG of security bolts. It's all been a rare and delicious moment for Kirk, and his face shows it. 
OVER the POD INTERCOM we HEAR, "Pod secured. Pressure equalized." Scott moves the control to open the hatch. 
58   INT. ENTERPRISE CARGO DECK (M)                              58 
A confusion of organized work and VOICES. The cargo deck bustles with activity; supplies and equipment being stored and installed. 
59   INT. CARGO DECK - BALCONY AND CATWALK                       59 
Kirk and Scott are met by a nervous, perspiring ENSIGN. 
KIRK AND SCOTT Permission to come aboard, sir...? 
ENSIGN Granted, sir. Welcome aboard, Admiral... Commander Scott, you're needed in Engineering immediately. 
SCOTT (to Kirk) Sir, you'll excuse me...? 
Kirk gestures him to leave, and Scott hurries away. Kirk stands a moment, gazing down at the cargo deck. 
60   ANGLE DOWN PAST KIRK TO FLOOR (M)                           60 
The crew maneuvering antigravity devices which move heavy containers -- scrambles of activity at storage holds and maintenance lockers. 
61   CLOSE ON KIRK AND ENSIGN                                    61 
Kirk is drinking it all in. He's home. 
ENSIGN (nervous) Sir, if you'll follow me, I'll... 
KIRK I think I can find my way, Ensign. 
And Kirk moves off, leaving the Ensign gazing at him, relieved. 
62   EXT. ELEVATOR AND CATWALK                                   62 
Kirk ENTERS ANGLE and the doors snap open. 
63   INT. ELEVATOR                                               63 
as Kirk enters. The doors close. Kirk waits a beat, savoring this moment too. Then, firmly to the control panel: 
KIRK Bridge! 
The turbo-elevator HUMS WITH POWER as it begins hur- tling up. On the wall back of Kirk we SEE an electronic diagram of the Enterprise tracking the elevator's speedy trip to the Bridge. 
64   INT. BRIDGE                                                 64 
A confusion of activity and VOICES. Pieces o equip- ment in a state of disarray: consoles open, fiber optic tubes unconnected, viewing screens dismantled. It's a frantic, desperate scene -- a ship and crew to- tally unprepared. In the midst of this: ALIEN ensign is assisting UHURA (Lt. Comdr. stripes)deftly working her communications station, AD LIBBING "... Hailing frequency four, check. Hailing frequency five, will someone please check me?" At the helm, sweat-soaked SULU (Lt. Comdr stripes) has a service plate open, is peering inside to make delicate adjust- ments, AD LIBBING "... Helm, now give me a reading on four point zero zero six of full." And at the Weapons Control, CHEKOV (Full Lt.)argues with TECHNICIANS who insist photon torpedoes read "ready" while Chekov argues the computer is not relaying that information. 
65   ANGLE ON THE ELEVATOR DOORS                                 65 
snapping open -- and there is Kirk. For the moment no one notices him, and he stands watching, remembering. And then he moves forward toward the command center. 
66   ACROSS UHURA TO KIRK                                        66 
as she is the first to see him. She reacts,pleased. 
UHURA Captain... Starfleet just signaled your transfer-of- command orders! 
67   ANOTHER ANGLE - VARIOUS REACTION                            67 
as everyone else is suddenly aware of Kirk. 
All work stops, with various AD LIBBED greetings from the old crew: "Admiral Kirk..." "It's the Captain...!" etc., etc. But most sit or stand, simple gaping at Kirk, all quite awed. The old hands, Uhura, Sulu, and Chekov start converging on Kirk. But he gestures them back, speaking crisply. KIRK I appreciate the welcome; I wish the circumstances were less critical. (to Uhura) Epsilon Nine is monitoring the intruder; keep a channel open to them. (glances around) Where is Captain Decker? 
SULU He's in Engineering, sir... (uncomfortable, indicates Captain's chair) He doesn't know. 
Kirk reacts with some exasperation, starts away, addresses Chekov: 
KIRK Mr Chekov, assemble the crew on the Rec Deck at 0400 hours. I want to show them what we're facing. 
And Kirk moves to the elevator, enters, is gone. The moment the elevator doors snap closed: 
SULU I wouldn't have wanted to have been standing in his way. He wanted her back; he got her! 
ALIEN ENSIGN (perturbed) And Captain Decker? He's been with the ship every minute of her refitting... 
UHURA (brittle) Ensign -- our chances of coming back from this mission in one piece may have just doubled...! 
68   OMITTED                                                     68 
70   INT. ENGINEERING SECTION                                    70 
The entire complex a beehive of pre-departure activity. ENGINEERING PERSONNEL (at least a third of them female) coming and going, the platform-elevators (small, one- man lifts to various levels) busy. A gentle but con- stant HUM and WHIRR flows from the engine core, to indi- cate a pre-idling mode. There will be continual AD LIBBED conversation among the Technicians. 
Now the Engine Room door opens and Kirk steps into the area. He stands a moment observing the activity. a grizzled ENGINEERING CHIEF pushes a huge condenser on an anti-grav device past irk with a respectful "watch it, sir" admonishment. Kirk moves on to: 
STARFLEET VOICE Unable to retrieve their pattern, Enterprise....! 
Rand reacts in real horror now as human forms begin to FAINTLY MATERIALIZE, then FADE AWAY, then REAPPEAR IN FAINTLY MISSHAPEN FORM as she frantically works con- trols. Kirk ENTERS fast, steps to the console to assist Rand; Scott has also come in and moves to the console, brushes aside the Asst. Chief, and begins manipulating the additional controls himself. 
SCOTT We're losing the pattern...! 
KIRK (into intercom) Starfleet, boost your matter gain; we need more signal! 
RAND Oh, no! They're forming! 
77   CLOSER ON THE TRANSPORTER CHAMBER (O)                       77 
with the human forms FLUTTERING INTO FULLER AND FULLER MATERIALIZATION, FRIGHTENINGLY, HORRIBLY MISSHAPEN. We RECOGNIZE one form as the Vulcan, Sonak -- the other a human WOMAN. They MATERIALIZE; we HEAR A MOAN form from the Vulcan -- the Woman's SCREAM OF PAIN. Then, all at once, the half-materialized bodies are gone; the transporter chamber is empty. 
KIRK Oh, my God...! 
78   KIRK, SCOTT AND RAND                                        78 
gazing, horrified, at the empty chamber. 
KIRK (into intercom) Starfleet, do you have them? 
A mutter of utter, vacant silence -- and Kirk and Scott look at each other again, their pained faces presaging the answer they already know: 
STARFLEET VOICE (shaken) Enterprise... what we got back didn't live long. Fortunately. 
Another moment of stunned silence, and then Kirk hits the transmission button -- fighting to control his voice as: 
KIRK Starfleet... Kirk. Please... express my condolences to their families. Commander Sonak's can be reached through the Vulcan Embassy. (see Rand's stricken expression) There was nothing you could have done, Rand. It wasn't your fault. 
And before Rand can answer, Kirk leaves the room. 
79   INT. CORRIDOR - TRAVELING WITH KIRK                         79 
as Kirk steps out, and the doors snap closed behind him. In the corridor the furor of the hurried depar- ture is, as everywhere, quite evident: CREW MEMBERS move back and forth. But Kirk does not see them; his mind is tormented by the transporter accident -- was there something he should have done, could have done, to prevent it? Should he launch on schedule with the starship this unready? Has he done right in yielding to this terrible needs for starship command again, forcing Starfleet to give her to him? Would Decker's knowledge of the new design have prevented the acci- dent? 
Kirk reaches a corridor intersection, looks around, realizes he's lost track of where he is. A passing YEOMAN stops in response to his puzzled expression. 
KIRK Turboshaft eight...? 
YEOMAN Back that way, sir. 
She's indicating back the direction from which Kirk came. He nods his thanks, turns and moves back down the corridor. 
80   DECKER                                                      80 
hurrying down the corridor. The two face each other a silent moment, Decker studying Kirk curiously. 
KIRK We'll have to replace Commander Sonak. I'd still like a Vulcan there, if possible... 
DECKER None available, Captain. There's no one in fact, who's fully rated on this design. 
KIRK You are, Mister Decker. I'm afraid you'll have to double as Science Officer. 
And Kirk moves on, Decker stands gazing reflectively after him. 
81    OMITTED                                                    81 
85    CLOSE - FULL SHOT OF THE KLINGON SHIP BEING DESTROYED      85 (AS SEEN ON VIEWER) (O) (in the last part of the scene which showed the Klingon Captain speaking in Klingonese and an English print- out interpretation appearing at the screen bottom. The Klingon ship nearly totaled; one engine nacelle gone, smoke and flame spewing from the other, etc. And then that final WHIPLASH ENERGY BOLT STRIKING AND SPECTACULARLY DESTROYING THE SHIP, etc.) 
But this time, O.S., we HEAR GASPS of incredulity from many throats (an audience), and various AD LIBBED com- ments: "My God...!" "I don't believe it...!" "What could it be...?" Etc., etc. 
And then, immediately following this, on the viewer: 
86   THE LUMINESCENT CLOUD (AS SEEN ON A VIEWER) (O)             86 
(as in earlier Epsilon 9 viewer -- but with no music, only more AD LIBBED exclamations from an audience.) The viewer goes blank. 
87   INT. RECREATION DECK (M)                                    87 
We SEE that all this was being viewed by the CREW MEMBERS (Aliens included) assembled on the Rec Deck. 
The Recreation Deck is one of the largest areas on the ship, several deck levels high, a part of one wall consisting of picture windows, through which can be seen sections of the drydock structure outside. 
On another wall is a large viewer, on which was just shown the Klingon transmission. Leading off and away from this deck area are what are obviously other specific recreation areas -- gymnasiums, food centers, game rooms, lounges, etc. 
88   ANOTHER ANGLE OF THE RED DECK - HIGHER LEVEL                88 
as the Crew Members chat in low, grim tones -- Kirk (now with Captain's stripes) appears. As he comes into view, the two hundred or so crew below go silent. Kirk grimly indicates the now blank viewer: 
KIRK That's all we know about it; except that it's now 2.2 days from Earth. Enterprise is the only Federation starship that stands in its way. 
89   ANOTHER ANGLE - CREW REACTIONS                              89 
as the CAMERA FINDS various faces: human, alien; most young, all intelligent, forthright -- anxious. Kirk has paused a moment, now continues. 
KIRK (O.S.) We assume there is a vessel of some type at the heart of the cloud. Our orders are to intercept, investigate; and take whatever action is necessary... and possible. (beat) ...We can only hope that the life form aboard that vessel reasons as we do. 
KIRK (formally; rising) Welcome aboard, Lieutenant. 
99   ACROSS ILIA TO DECKER                                       99 
as Ilia starts to speak, suddenly stops: she has just then noticed Decker, who has stepped from his station to face her. For an electronic moment their eyes meet, hold in unquestioned recognition. 
DECKER Hello, Ilia. 
ILIA (surprised) Decker....! 
Kirk has observed this with surprise and some concern (it presages possible complications). Decker turns to Kirk, slightly uncomfortable at this. DECKER I was stationed on the Lieutenant's home planet some years ago... 
Ilia looks from Kirk back to Decker, puzzled at his sleeve stripes. 
ILIA (eyes his rank stripes) 'Commander' Decker? 
KIRK Our Exec and Science Officer... 
DECKER (bitingly) Captain Kirk has the utmost confidence in me. 
Kirk flashes a hard glance at Decker, then toward Ilia too. 
KIRK (pointedly) And in you, too, Lieutenant. 
ILIA My oath of celibacy is on record Captain. May I assume my duties? 
While respectful, her tone of voice has been just as firm as Kirk's. 
KIRK By all means. 
100   ACROSS KIRK TO UHURA                                       100 
receiving a message, now relaying it. 
UHURA Captain, Starfleet reports our last six crew members ready to beam up... (puzzled) ... but one of them is refusing to step into the transporter. 
Just as Kirk a moment before was tense, now suddenly he's relaxed again; he rises. 
KIRK (pleased) Oh? I'll see that he beams up...! 
And he hurries from the bridge, onto the elevator, is gone. A moment of puzzled silence, then: DECKER Mr. Sulu, take Lieutenant Ilia in hand. 
SULU (startled) Sir...? (then understands) Yes, of course... (to Ilia) Your pre-programming is already set in, Lieutenant. 
Sulu has almost tripped getting out of his chair. He starts offering Ilia his hand, then thinks better of it, withdraws it abruptly, immediately busies himself punching out equations on her console... AD LIBS, "It's all on the computer. You'll have no problem..." Sulu is nervous, fluttery around this lovely creature -- now hits a wrong switch. Produces a BEEPING SOUND which he fumbles to shut off. She smiles; speaks quietly, repeats: 
ILIA I'm sworn to celibacy, Mister Sulu. That makes me as safe as any human female. 
Sulu catches her eye but before he can reply, Decker has moved in beside Ilia. 
DECKER I now the Captain meant no person- al insult. 
ILIA (eyes on console) I would never take advantage of a sexually immature species. (looks at him) You can assure him that's true, can't you? 
Clearly, the remark carries special, personal significance. 
101    INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM                                      101 
Kirk entering as Rand and her assistant electronically list the last of the five arrivals who are leaving the Transporter Chamber. Kirk calls through intercom to the last arrival, a young female Yeoman. 
KIRK Yeoman, what was the problem down there? 
YEOMAN (through intercom) He insisted we go first, sir. Said something about first seeing how it scrambled our molecules. 
KIRK Thank you, Yeoman (hits transmit control) Starfleet , this is Captain Kirk. The officer is to be beamed up immediately! 
103   ANGLE ON THE CHAMBER (O)                                   103 
A moment, then again the GENERATING HUMMING, and then the familiar BEAMING EFFECT. And then you SEE McCOY! He fully MATERIALIZES. He looks himself over as if in pleased surprise he is still in one piece. CAMERA PANS McCoy from the Transporter Chamber to Kirk who is hav- ing a hard time containing his amusement and delight. 
KIRK Well, for a man who swore he'd never return to Starfleet... 
McCOY (flat, tight) What happened, Captain, sir, was that your revered Admiral Nogura invoked a little known -- and seldom used -- reserve activation clause... (snaps) ... in simpler language, Captain, sir, they drafted me! 
KIRK (straight-faced) They didn't...! 
Kirk has offered his hand, but McCoy is already flaring: 
McCOY This was your idea! It was your idea, wasn't it! 
KIRK Bones, there's a 'thing' out there -- 
McCOY -- Why is any object we don't understand called a 'thing'? 
KIRK (continues) -- headed this way. I need you... McCOY Were you behind this? 
KIRK (nods) Bones, I need you badly. 
ILIA Computing new interception course. 
UHURA Communications are normal, Captain. 
CHEKOV (to Kirk) Negative damage report, sir. (to McCoy) No casualties reported, sir.

SCOTT In just a second, Exec; we're picking up the pieces down here. 
138   INT. BRIDGE                                                138 
Kirk seeming to collect his thoughts now -- he gives Decker a look, uses the intercom himself: 
KIRK Warp Drive as soon as possible, Mr. Scott. 
SCOTT'S INTERCOM VOICE (protesting) Captain, it was our anti-matter imbalance that created the wormhole in the first place. It will happen again if we don't correct it. 
KIRK That object out there is less than two days from Earth, Mister Scott. We've got to intercept while it still is out there! 
SCOTT'S INTERCOM VOICE (near annoyed) Aye, we understand that sir! We're doing our best. 
as Kirk flips off the intercom, rises determinedly, faces Decker: 
KIRK Mr. Decker, I'd like to see you in my quarters. (toward helm) You have the conn, Mr. Sulu. 
McCOY (to Kirk) Mind if I tag along? 
Kirk gives McCoy an annoyed look, then strides to the elevator. Decker, grim, follows -- McCoy brings up the rear as they EXIT.

SULU Maintaining warp point eight; I show our new heading as 287 point three Mark 105. 
Ilia's attention is directed toward Decker. 
SULU (continuing; gently reminding) Lieutenant Ilia...? 
ILIA (a beat; then quickly) Confirmed, Mr. Sulu. Confirmed. 
And she punches in some equations, then again peers up at the doors where she last saw Decker. She is very concerned. 
140   INT. KIRK'S QUARTERS                                       140 
The doors opening, Kirk entering, McCoy moves to b.g. while Decker stands attentively, waiting as Kirk turns to him. 
KIRK Explanation, Mr. Decker: Why was my phaser order countermanded? 
DECKER (cool, polite) Sir, the Enterprise redesign increases phaser power by channeling it through the main engines. When they went into anti-matter imbalance, the phasers were automatically cut off. 
Kirk is surprised by this information, perhaps slight- ly chagrined. After a beat: 
KIRK Then you acted properly, of course. 
DECKER Thank you, sir. I'm sorry I embar- rassed you. 
KIRK You saved the ship. 
DECKER (coolly) I'm aware of that, sir. 
KIRK (flaring) Stop competing with me, Decker! 
DECKER Permission to speak freely, sir? 
KIRK (tight) Granted. 
DECKER Sir, you haven't logged a single star hour in two and a half years. That, plus your unfamiliarity with the ship's design -- in my opinion, sir, seriously jeopardizes our mission. 
Kirk reacts with anger. Struggles for and regains control. 
KIRK I trust you will... nursemaid me through these difficulties, Mister? 
DECKER Yes, sir, I'll do that. 
Kirk peers at Decker, who stands facing him determinedly. 
KIRK Then I won't keep you from your duties any longer, Commander. (whirling at McCoy) Yes, Doctor? 
Kirk's last line has drowned out Decker's "Aye, sir." McCoy says nothing, waits until Decker is gone and the door closes behind him. Then: 
CHEKOV Should I go to battle stations, sir. 
KIRK Negative, We'll take no prov- ocative action. 
Decker has reacted sharply, disapprovingly, to this: 
DECKER Recommend defensive posture, Captain: Screens and shields. 
KIRK No... (pause) ... that could also be misinter- preted as hostile, Mr. Decker. (to Spock) Cloud composition, Mr. Spock? 
SPOCK Twelve power energy field -- 
SULU (in disbelief) -- twelve power?! 
DECKER (urgently) Captain, we've seen what their weapons can do. Shouldn't we take every possible precaution -- ? 
KIRK Mr Decker.... 
SPOCK (interrupting) Captain, I suspect there's an object at the heart of that cloud. 
KIRK (cool) Mr. Decker, I will not provoke an attack, If that order isn't clear to you... 
DECKER (interrupting in mid sentence) Captain, as your Exec, it's my duty to point out alternatives. 
A moment of thought from Kirk. ILIA Five minutes to Cloud boundary! 
KIRK (a look) I stand corrected Mr. Decker. (toward Ilia) Navigator, lay in a conic section flight path into the cloud center; bring us parallel to whatever we find in there... 
162   FAVORING THE VIEWER (O)                                   162 
The Cloud has now grown so large it DOMINATES THE ENTIRE VIEWER. Sulu hits a button, reducing magnif- cation. Immediately, the CLOUD diminishes in size -- but almost instantly begins GROWING AGAIN. Decker's annoyance (with Kirk) suddenly seems to dissipate as his total attention is diverted to the cloud. 
162A   ANOTHER ANGLE - SPOCK, DECKER AND KIRK                    162A 
Decker turning to Spock 
DECKER That measures twelve power? Ten thousands of starships couldn't generate that much... Decker trails his words, realizing that Spock isn't hearing a word. Spock's attention is on the O.S. main viewer, totally absorbed by something he's feeling. He is slowly rising from his seat, stepping forward -- Kirk becomes conscious of this, turns and sees Spock's strange expression. Before he can speak: 
SPOCK They have... they have been communicating with us. I sense ... puzzlement. Why have we not replied? 
KIRK Communicated with us how? 
Spock shakes his head... then reacts as if sensing or theorizing something further. He turns, moves quickly to his console, begins there as if searching for something. Interrupted by another ALARM KLAXON. 
DECKER Signal medical alert, Mister Chekov!

From the Bridge a CACOPHONY OF VOICES AND SOUNDS, but all organized and disciplined with the BRIDGE LIGHTING DIMMING and then as though traveling the last short distance (actually several million miles) in the wink of an eye -- the WHIPLASH OF ENERGY STRIKES. The bridge lights go out. 
In the sudden darkness, the main viewer is all at once a frantic, furious, pattern of GREEN-WHITE FLARING ENERGY, accompanied by an EXPLOSIVE SHRILLING SOUND. It seems to cling to the forcefields, the incredible energy of the forcefield barriers.

Ilia reacts first, crossing quickly to assist Chekov -- Decker joins her, taking over Chekov's console.

relief, incredulity. 
SPOCK It appears that our message has been understood, Captain. 
KIRK (to Uhura) Any reply from them? 
UHURA Negative, no reply, sir. 
KIRK (returning to Spock) Spock, have you sensed anything else? 
Spock turns, gives the O.S. viewer a glance. Then he shakes head. 
SPOCK The 'puzzlement' I sensed was fleeting... minor... (ponders, then) ... as if carrying a sense of our insignificance, Captain. 
KIRK Our... 'insignificance'? 
All have reacted to this; Kirk exchanges a look with Spock who nods firmly. Then Kirk sees that both Decker and Sulu are throwing him a questioning look. In b.g. McCoy and Chapel have EXITED bridge with Chekov. 
SPOCK We are obviously confronted by a highly advanced mentality... yet they cannot understand who we are, or what we want. 
KIRK But they understood our messages; they broke off the attack. 
DECKER They may have attacked only as a warning to us, Captain. To keep away. 
SPOCK That would presuppose a feeling, Commander... compassion. I sensed no emotion, only... (reverentially) ... pure logic. 
Kirk peers at Spock hoping for some assistance on the decision; but Spock merely peers back at him ex- pressionlessly: the decision is Kirk's. Kirk faces Spock one last beat, then turns and starts back to- ward his chair, calling to Ilia.

It shows a large schematic of the Cloud itself as well as a series of FAINTLY BLINKING schematics of various recent positions and directional attitudes of the Enterprise during its approach. These blinking Enterprise schematics show that the starship has  gone from a head-on approach to the Cloud into a (tech. advice) skidding movement around the Cloud (the star- ship always heading directly toward Cloud center), with the last Enterprise positions now showing it ap- roaching the Cloud from a quartering rear approach.

KIRK That thing is twenty hours from Earth. We know nothing about it yet. 
Decker glances around, moves close to Kirk so only Spock is able to overhear: 
DECKER That's precisely the point, Captain. We don't know it will do. Moving into the cloud -- at this time, is an unwarranted gamble. 
KIRK How do you define unwarranted, mister?! 
DECKER You asked my opinion, sir. 
Kirk looks at him, then at Spock, who once more is peering in momentary concentration at the viewer, feels Kirk's gaze -- and turns to him, again expres- sionlessly; it's up to Kirk.

The Enterprise is now quartering in toward the Intruder, coming closer and closer. The Alien vessel is still GROWING IN SIZE -- more and more, its exterior appears to be made of substances never before seen by a human eye -- substances considered possible only in the wildest flights of scientific theory -- plasma-matter, energy fields diamond--hard in their power, solid sheets of subatomic particles, crystalline-lace patterns which seem capable of shifting their nature and rearranging themselves.

Kirk's voice is blotted out by a DEAFENING, SHRILL- ING SOUND, accompanied by a multi-hued point of LIGHT which EXPLODES into BLINDING INTENSITY, obscuring everything for an instant. Overlapping this action, we HEAR:

It is about seven feet tall and resembles a "blob" of raw energy in shifting patterns and colors of deep, ugly hues of upper spectrum violet. Yet, it looks strangely alive. At the end of the "tendril" (of light) is an "eye" (a small multi-colored device) 
209   CREW REACTIONS -- ELEVATORS IN B.G. (O)                    209 
The bridge crew reacting hard, shocked and shaken -- the THROBBING SOUND of the Alien thing intensifies as it begins to move across the bridge. Suddenly, in b.g., an elevator door snaps oen and two SECURITY MEN burst onto the bridge, phasers drawn. Chekov shouts warningly at the Men: 
CHEKOV No weapons...! 
But Chekov is too late: First Security Man FIRES -- the BLAST harmlessly absorbed by the Probe which emits a SCREECHING nerve-grating SOUND --- sends out a SMALL WHIPLASH ENERGY BOLT which instantly envelopes First Security Man in a PURPLE GLOW (of implosion). Second Security Man has almost lifted his phaser -- but now carefully, slowly is moving his hand away from his weapon. 
210   CLOSER - THE SECURITY MEN (O)                              210

Chekov, like the others, horrified, flips a switch and the COMPUTER-VOICE ("Intruder Alert") goes OFF. At the same time Chekov speaks into his intercom: 
CHEKOV Security... do not send further teams! 
The Probe is sending out snake-like tendrils to the various consoles on the bridge. 
These tendrils lash out in a cobra-strike movement, the tendril-head seeming to enter into the console affected -- at which time all monitors and instrument lights there come ON as if the Probe is "reading" each console function. The crew carefully stays clear of the tendrils. 
Spock has risen, moving to Kirk's side as he slowly brings his tricorder up, very carefully extracting its tiny sensor and aiming it at the probe. 
CHEKOV (shaken) No intruder readings on other decks, Captain... (to Spock) Can that be one of their crew? 
SPOCK (quiet) A probe from their vessel... (to Kirk) A plasma-energy combination... 
Meanwhile, the probe is now hovering near Chekov who sits frozen, fists clenched, jaw tight. 
DECKER Don't interfere with it...! 
CHEKOV Absolutely, I will not interfere!

as the "probe" withdraws an energy-tendril from one bridge station and "inserts" it into another console. 
KIRK No one interfere...! It doesn't seem interested in us -- only the ship...! 
Kirk's words are never completed as suddenly all the energy tendrils withdraw from all consoles and a larger, more powerful-looking tendril lashes out, snaking into the science console complex. 
210C   CLOSER ON SCIENCE CONSOLE                                 210C 
Where, also immediately, all the console and computer lights are suddenly flashing wildly, rapidly -- 
-- There is an incredibly fast EXCHANGE OF HIGH-PITCHED BEES -- the computer obviously in unauthorized commu- nication with the probe! 
KIRK Computer off! 
DECKER It's taken control of the computer...! 
KIRK It's running our records! Starfleet strength, Earth defenses... 
As Decker moves to the main power control, Spock now steps in, his Vulcan strength easily brushing Kirk and Decker aside. Spock clasps his fists above his head, brings it down in a SHATTERING BLOW on the console. It splits open! As the bridge lights dim even more, and as the science console shorts itself out -- and off, Decker confronts Spock: 
DECKER We could have cut it off at the main computer... 
SPOCK This served the purpose. 
Kirk has been giving Spock a puzzled look -- Spock now turns abruptly, and: 
Before Spock can reply: 
UHURA They're pulling us inside...! 
All face the Viewer again, react, with McCoy who has been observing all these reactions now galvanized into action: 
McCOY (to Chekov) Medical observers to all decks! 
And he hurries toward the elevators, CAMERA WITH HIM a moment, then SWINGING BACK TO:

KIRK (to "Ilia") Why does V'ger travel to the third planet of the solar system directly ahead? 
"ILIA" V'ger travels to the third planet to find the Creator. 
Stunned, disbelieving reactions as all four attempt to digest this -- Spock gazing at "Ilia" with even more rapt fascination. Kirk, bewildered, addresses the others: 
KIRK Find the Creator? What Creator? Whose...!? (to "Ilia") What does V'ger want of the 'Creator'... ? 
"ILIA" To join with him.

McCOY (worried) Mr. Spock, be careful. 
"ILIA" The Creator is that which created V'ger. 
KIRK Who is V'ger? 
"ILIA" V'ger is that which seeks the Creator. 
Another moment of total exasperation, frustration, during which "Ilia" seems to be waiting politely, patiently for any further questions. When none are forthcoming: 
"ILIA" (continuing; pleasant, bland) I am ready to commence my observations. 
SPOCK (fast; to McCoy) Doctor, a thorough examination of this probe might provide some insight into those who manufactured it, and how to deal with them. 
McCOY Let's get her to sickbay. 
And he grasps "Ilia's" arm to escort her. But is as though he has seized cast iron: immovable. McCoy is thrown off balance merely by 'Ilia's" remaining sta- tionary. She ignores McCoy, addresses Kirk: 
"ILIA" I am programmed to observe and record normal functioning procedures of the carbon-based units. 
256B   Kirk glances at McCoy, who is totally bemused, but then   256B Kirk quickly responds to "Ilia": KIRK The examination is a normal function.

as everyone reacts to "Ilia's" utterance of Decker's name. It seems to make the deepest impression on Spock, confirming something he has suspected. SPOCK (to "Ilia") Interesting. Not 'Decker-unit'? 
"Ilia" continues peering at Decker with just a hint of a puzzled frown, a glimmer of distant recognition. It's the first time we've seen her expression look anything but cool and bland. This results in the quizzical rising of one of Spock's eyebrows. 
258   ANOTHER ANGLE                                              258 
McCoy's examination now turns "Ilia" away from the others. Spock quickly catches Kirk's and Decker's attention, indicates an adjoining door -- they fol- low him out of the room. 
259   INT. McCOY'S OFFICE                                        259 
as Kirk, Spock and Decker enter, the door snapping shut -- and Spock touching the electronic lock to secure them. He faces the others: 
SPOCK Captain... this probe may be a key a key to the Aliens. 
DECKER It's a programmed mechanism, Mr. Spock... 
SPOCK We have just seen that its body duplicates our navigator in precise detail. Suppose that beneath its programming, the real Ilia's memory patterns are duplicated with equal precision. 
KIRK They had a pattern to follow... 
SPOCK (nods) ... they may have followed it too precisely. 
As "Ilia" moves on into the room, Decker follows: "ILIA" The words 'recreation' and 'enjoy' have no meaning to my programming. 
Decker peers at the lovely android with frustration -- and no little pain, for she is after all the exact replica of Ilia. She pays not the slightest attention to Decker's reaction, and begins walking about the Rec Deck taking in (and, clearly, transmitting all images to V'ger) the sights. They are near a game area (elec- tronic games), and now Decker points to one game, switches it on -- presses button to activate its LIGHTS and SOUNDS. "Ilia" watches interestedly as Decker operates the game. 
DECKER Ilia 'enjoyed' this game... she nearly always won -- 
And he demonstrates again, as "Ilia" steps to the device, deftly hits some buttons -- and for just an instant she turns to Decker with a momentary glimmer of recognition. 
269   INT. KIRK'S CABIN - GROUP WATCHING THE MONITOR             269 
McCoy watching with special interest: 
McCOY (approving) Good! He's using audial-visual association. 
But the words are not out of McCoy's mouth when "Ilia" says: 
"ILIA" This device serves no purpose. 
She steps away from the game; Decker's disappointment is evident. So is everyone elses. 
KIRK Damn...! 
McCOY (nods grimly) She needs something else: something much more personal to stimulate memory patterns. Something with a more emotional tie. 
Kirk reacts to this, reflective. 
270   INT. REC DECK  FULL ON DECKER AND "ILIA"                   270 
Decker waving back toward the general area of the Enterprise pictures. 
DECKER The crews of the previous Enterprises were also carbon units. In what way is the life form in your vessel different? 
"ILIA" Carbon units are not true life forms... Do those images repre- sent how Enterprise has evolved into its present form? 
DECKER (hoping he's struck a responsive chord) Yes. 
"ILIA" Carbon units have clearly retarded Enterprise's proper evolvement. 
DECKER (controlling surprise) What is Enterprise's proper evolvement? 
"ILIA" Enterprise should not require the presence of carbon units. 
And with this she moves off, observing other Rec Deck objects. Decker moves with her; then: 
DECKER (carefully) Enterprise would be unable to function without carbon units. 
"ILIA" More data concerning this functioning is necessary before carbon units can be patterned for data storage. 
271   ACROSS "ILIA" TO DECKER                                    271 
as he reacts to this ominous note; he stops abruptly. 
DECKER What does that mean? 
"ILIA" (stopping; almost pleasantly) When my examination is complete, the carbon units will be reduced to data patterns. 
This has been delivered with chilling blandness, and she stands facing Decker, almost as though waiting for him to thank her. He thinks fast now. 
DECKER Within you are memory patterns of a carbon unit. If I can help you revive these patterns; you could understand our functions better. 
"ILIA" That is logical. You may procede. 
272   ON DECKER                                                  272 
realizing the difficult task ahead; the pain he will suffer. 
273   INT. V'GER - ANGLE UP TOWARD ENTERPRISE (M)                273 
The ship stationary in the chamber as now we SEE an exterior hatch sliding fully open. Up through the hatch a circular airlock door opens -- and a tiny figure in a thruster spacesuit emerges, steps into space, slowly floats down through the hatch and under the Enterprise saucer section. In this and subsequent VIEWS we will SEE that on the rear pack of his thruster spacesuit is a FLASHING STROBE LIGHT which regularly EMITS the identifying SIGNAL of this particular suit. (By which Kirk will be able to see Spock's position even from several miles away.) 
274   CLOSER ON THE SPACESUITED FIGURE (M)                       274 
MOVING TOWARD the CAMERA until the features behind the face mask are clearly identifiable: Spock, his face set in the same grim, determined expression, as he touches his spacesuit transmitter control. 
SPOCK Computer, commence recording. Captain Kirk -- this message will detail my attempt to contact the aliens... 
275   INT. BRIDGE                                                275 
Kirk ENTERING, crossing Uhura as she calls: 
UHURA Starfleet signals, sir, growing in strength... (listening intently) They -- have Intruder on their monitors -- it's decelerating -- powerfield cloud beginning to dissipate... 
SULU Confirm, Captain. Lunar beacons indicate Intruder on a course into Earth orbit... 
CHEKOV (interrupting) Sir! Airlock four has been opened; a thruster suit is reported missing! 
KIRK (reacts knowingly) Spock...! (to navigator) Get a fix on his position! 
"ILIA" Why have two carbon units entered V'ger...? 
Decker glances at McCoy, who shakes his head almost imperceptibly: he doesn't know. But Decker has an obvious reply: 
DECKER They want to make contact with V'ger... (trying to revive "Ilia's" memory again; touches her hand) Ilia... 
"Ilia" peers at him blankly, allows him to continue touching her hand, but obviously it means nothing to her. 
DECKER (continuing; distressed, to "Ilia") Does V'ger object to the presence of the two carbon units? 
"ILIA" The carbon units are of no consequence; V'ger will determine their purpose. 
McCOY Their purpose is to survive. 
"ILIA" That is also V'ger's purpose. 
Decker's face reflects his bemusement: 
DECKER You said V'ger's purpose was to find and join with the Creator. 
"ILIA" That is how V'ger will survive. 
286   ON DECKER                                                  286 
as now, the bemusement changes to just the slightest enlightenment. 
"ILIA" I wish to continue my observations. 
287   INT. V'GER - KIRK MANEUVERING WITHIN THE CHAMBER           287 
Kirk but a small object, thruster jets occasionally spurting as he guides himself deeper into the trench as he continues forward progress in the direction he saw Spock taking. 
288   CLOSER ON KIRK                                             288 
So we can SEE his face (through the plate), as he looks ahead into the distance toward Spock. 
289   KIRK'S POV (O)                                             289 
Spock's STROBE signal closer and Spock's tiny space- suited figure now becoming dimly visible as he moves steadily toward the GLOWING FORCEFIELDS of the inner wall.

His attention fixed on Spock, he never notices until an instant too late an O.S. object; quickly he hits a thruster control, and we SEE the MANEUVERING JET turn him to the side as: 
291   WIDER ANGLE - KIRK AND THE BLOB FORMATION (O)              291 
A swarm of strange-looking translucent crystal-like FORMS on a collision course with Kirk. (NOTE: They were traveling randomly, and are not deliberate ob- structions. However, Kirk's nearness now has attracted them and the swarm of them heads in his direction. Kirk tries to avoid them; he hits a second MANEUVERING JET -- but he overcompensates, and spins straight into the intercepting swarm of them. 
292   MED. SHOT - KIRK (O)                                       292

As the distant STROBE FLASHES of Kirk's spacesuit are MAGNIFIED CLOSER, pulling Kirk into MEDIUM LONG SHOT. We can SEE the details of the swarm of forms adhering. But we can SEE that Kirk's spacesuit is now about half covered with them! 
294A   REVERSE ANGLE                                             294A Expressions of bridge crew to reflect the horror of what they're seeing as: 
SULU Your phaser, Captain...! Use your phaser...!

CHEKOV Airlocks two and four -- prepare to launch rescue teams! (glancing at viewer) Chief Lang! Get them out there! Fast!

KIRK'S VOICE (weak; STATIC) ... Spock...! ... need help...! ... trapped...! 
No indication at first that Spock has heard; his face set with determination, his eyes fixed on his destin- ation: the inner wall. 
KIRK'S VOICE (continuing; weakening; STATIC) ... pressure on me...! ... can't move...! Spock...! 296   ON SPOCK - CLOSE                                           296

just now confronting them, regarding "Ilia" with open disapproval. 
SCOTT Well, sir, now what about all that? A living entity, the Captain says... entity... A living thing...! 
Decker really hasn't heard Scott; he's gazing at "Ilia," attempting to digest what she's just said. But quickly: 
DECKER Thank you, Scotty... 
He moves to leave. 
SCOTT (dourly) Your welcome, sir. 
Now Decker and "Ilia" move toward the exit, Scott gaz- ing after them glaringly, watching "Ilia's" every move. Suddenly, almost into the corridor, "Ilia" turns and looks back at the engine room. She addresses Decker, but load enough for Scott to overhear: 
"ILIA" There is no logical reason for carbon units to control Enterprise's power systems. 
SCOTT (to "Ilia") Lassie, if I were functioning 'logically,' right now I'd be showing you the inside of our scrap metal compactor! 
327   INT. BRIDGE                                                327 
Kirk with McCoy and Spock, who although somewhat shaky, is clearly more alert. They are just assuming their stations. 
UHURA We're now locked into Starfleet's transceivers; Admiral Nogura has received your reports, sir. 
328   ANGLE INCLUDING VIEWER (O)                                 328 
Kirk pausing halfway to his chair to study the viewer on which is appearing an IMAGE of V'ger looming omi- nously in orbit over Earth. 
UHURA The visual is a lunar monitor relay, sir. 
As they begin to study it, the IMAGE suddenly distorts and is replaced by signal interference -- SIGNAL STATIC LINES RUNNING ACROSS THE VIEWER SCREEN. (Somewhat resembling the kind of high voltage interference some-times seen on the television screen.) 
UHURA (continuing) Heavy interference, sir -- it's coming from here, inside the intruder itself... 
Uhura hits buttons and immediately from the speakers we HEAR A SERIES OF CARRIER WAVE BEEPS. Spock looks up from his console, listens to it. 
SPOCK Puzzling! The interference appears to be a rather simple carrier wave code signal... 
UHURA On an old style radio frequency, sir... 
329   PAST KIRK TO THE ELEVATOR                                  329 
as the doors snap open and Decker and "Ilia" appear. All eyes go to them as: 
"ILIA" (to Decker; interrupting) As I stated, V'ger calls to the Creator. 
DECKER (nods; turns to Kirk) V'ger is announcing that it has arrived, sir -- that it's ready to deliver the information it was programmed to collect... 
"ILIA" 'To learn all that is learnable.' 
DECKER (to Kirk) It expects a return signal now, ordering it to transmit that information to the Creator. 
UHURA (whirling) Sir! V'ger's signals have stopped... 
"ILIA" (as if frightened) Decker... The Creator has not responded. 
Kirk hears this, turning inquiringly toward her, but Uhura interrupts: 
UHURA Picking up Starfleet again; a lunar monitor relay... 
330   ANGLE INCLUDING VIEWER (O)                                 330 
as, indeed, the interference is fading and a new Main Viewer IMAGE is appearing -- it shows V'GER IN EARTH ORBIT with a strange looking OBJECT moving away from V'ger. It is an ominous looking, HUGE SWIRLING GREEN MASS -- it resembles the same green plasma-energy bolts that destroyed the Klingons and Epsilon 9 -- and very nearly the Enterprise. It is not a bolt now -- the mass is much larger and appears much more deadly. A second object has now formed and moves off, a third one begins to appear. (Meanwhile, the first and second PLASMA- ENERGY OBJECTS are moving off into the distance in different direction.) 
McCOY My God! They're the same kind of things that destroyed the Klingons, Epsilon Nine... 
SPOCK (interrupting; from science console) These read as identical composition... (turns to Kirk) ... however, Captain, they measure several hundred times more powerful! 
KIRK High mag, Mr. Sulu! 
Sulu adjusts the viewer through several IMAGE MAGNI- FICATIONS until we SEE the huge OMINOUS GREEN DEVICES more clearly. 
SULU The third one is moving off too -- a fourth one is forming... 
UHURA (overlapping) Urgent signal from Starfleet, Captain! (turns, shaken) All Earth defense systems have gone dead. 
Kirk reacts hard at this. Uhura gets another message. 
UHURA (continuing) Sir, Starfleet computes their trajectories as moving toward equidistant positions over Earth.

DAMAGE TECH. (leaving bridge; to Captain) Severe stress on engine pylons, sir. 
"ILIA" (to Kirk; flat) V'ger requires the information. 
Kirk merely looks at her, then to the evacuating crew: 
KIRK Bridge secure all stations! Move out! 
McCOY Jim, what the hell kind of strategy is this...? 
Meanwhile, Decker has crossed to Chekov's now abandoned console, checks it. 
DECKER All ship's functions going to automatic, Captain. 
339   ANGLE ON KIRK                                              339 
turning to confront "Ilia": 
KIRK If V'ger destroys the Enterprise, the information V'ger requires will also be destroyed.

as LIGHT SHOW outside perceptically recedes, and simul- taneously the ROCKING CEASES. At the same time, "Ilia" is saying: 
"ILIA" It is illogical to withhold required information. 
Kirk does not reply to this, turns away to observe the withdrawing crew. Most are out; only Spock, Decker and McCoy remain behind -- with McCoy on his way. The bridge lighting dims, and now Kirk looks at Spock, who nods approvingly; clearly Spock is the only person who seems to comprehend what Kirk is doing, and why. As Kirk now moves toward the exit, and the lights are dimmed even further: 
"ILIA" (almost polite) Kirk-unit, why do you not disclose information? 
KIRK Because V'ger is going to destroy all the carbon units on the third planet. 
"ILIA" They have repressed the Creator. 
KIRK The information will not be disclosed. 
And, gesturing the others ahead of him, Kirk starts toward the bridge elevator. "Ilia" calls after him: 
"ILIA" (almost a plea) V'ger needs the information. 
340   AT THE ELEVATORS                                           340 
Decker and McCoy about to enter, Spock and Kirk just behind -- all stopping abruptly now at "Ilia's" state- ment. The very tone of her voice is enough for them to realize they have made a very telling point. Kirk follows fast: 
KIRK Then V'ger must withdraw its orbiting devices. 
"ILIA" V'ger will comply if the carbon units disclose the information. 
341   ANGLE ON McCOY                                             341

McCOY It learns fast, doesn't it...? 
342   ACROSS McCOY TO KIRK AND SPOCK                             342 
as Kirk looks at Spock, Kirk's whole expression convey- ing the obvious question: "What the hell do we do now?" But Spock is ready with an answer: 
SPOCK Captain, the vessel -- V'ger -- obviously operates from a central brain complex... 
Spock allows the sentence to hang, as he and Kirk eye each other significantly, the CAMERA SWINGING OVER TO KIRK so we can perceive that to Kirk this idea has an even greater significance. 
KIRK (to Spock) The orbiting devices would be controlled from the point, then...? 
SPOCK Precisely. 
Kirk nods grimly, faces "Ilia" again; this time he's playing for all the stakes. 
KIRK The carbon units' information cannot be disclosed to V'ger's probe... only to V'ger directly. 
343   ANOTHER ANGLE - REACTIONS                                  343 
all wait with hushed expectancy, all eyes on "Ilia" who seems momentarily in some internal communication. 
She turns away from Kirk and steps forward looking at the Main Viewer.

Kirk's back to Spock as he watches the viewer, Kirk now turning toward Spock. 
KIRK Spock... Spock... 
Spock does not respond, then Kirk reacts with momentary annoyance, then realizes Spock is totally distracted. Kirk peers at him a moment, then suddenly rises and steps up to: 
353   SPOCK'S STATION - KIRK AND SPOCK (McCOY IN B.G.)           353 
as Kirk arrives, with Spock still facing away from him, clearly distracted. 
KIRK (starts) Mr. Spock -- I think... 
Spock moves to face him, turning fully INTO the CAMERA so we can see now, just under Spock's eye: 
A tear! Welling fom the eye, rolling down his cheek. Kirk is speechless a moment, glances at McCoy who has also witnessed this phenomenon, and started toward Spock; but Kirk gestures McCoy to stay back, as he addresses Spock: 
KIRK (quiet, feeling) Not for us? 
SPOCK No, Captain, not for us... for V'ger. Spock pauses as Kirk peers incredulously at him, then continues: 
SPOCK (continuing) I weep for V'ger, as I would for a brother -- far more knowledgeable than I -- and yet one step behind. 
354   ANGLE ON McCOY AND DECKER                                  354 
Listening, McCoy's face reflecting concern; Decker's face compassion and understanding, with Decker step- ping closer to Spock, as Spock continues: 
SPOCK As I was -- when I came aboard... so is V'ger now: empty, incomplete. Searching. Logic and knowledge are not enough. 
McCOY (with empathy) Spock, are you saying that you found, what you needed -- but V'ger hasn't? 
SPOCK Has not, Doctor -- and now, because of what we are planning... will not... 
KIRK (almost hard) There is no alternative. 
DECKER (gently pressing) Mr. Spock, what would V'ger need to fulfill itself? 
SPOCK V'ger has begun to understand the true limits of our universe, thereby realizing the existence of other dimensions. To fulfill itself it must evolve to a higher dimension; V'ger believes this can be achieved only by joining with the Creator. 
SPOCK (ALTERNATIVE) Each of us, at some time in our life, turns to someone, a father, a brother, a God and asks 'Why am I here?' 'What was I meant to be?' V'ger hopes to touch its Creator to find its answers. 
355   ACROSS KIRK TO DECKER                                      355 
as Decker reacts with sudden, almost evangelical en- lightenment, as Kirk Says: 
KIRK (understanding) 'Is this all that I am? Is there nothing more? 
ON DIFALCO 
reacting to the (O.S.) viewer, AD-LIBBING a terse: 
DIFALCO Captain...! 
PAST KIRK AND SPOCK TO THE VIEWER where another opening is suddenly visible -- another chamber. But the violent and color energy effects of the previous chambers are no longer evident. Instead, the entire chamber appears beautifully symmetrical, with a strange, subdued glow, which increases as we move closer. 
SPOCK (flat) Captain, I believe that is our destination. 356   EXT. ENTERRISE - INT. V'GER - NEAR THE "ISLAND"            356 COMPLEX 
This enormous chamber resembles a hemisphere, laced throughout with dazzling energy patterns, not at all ominous, but quite lovely in effect. As the Enterprise continues forward motion, now ahead you will to SEE a small "island." Floating in the exact center of the hemisphere, the "island" seems alive with PULSING LIGHT, with more of the lovely and delicate ENERGY FORMS and COLORS. On the "island," vague at this distance, ap pears to be a "solid" matter form. 
357   INT. BRIDGE - INCLUDING VIEWER                             357 
The "island" looming larger in the distance. And the Enterprise (as evidenced from the viewer) perceptibly slowing. Kirk just resuming his command chair, as: SULU Forward motion slowing, Captain...! 
Kirk says nothing a moment, studies the viewer -- and then: 
KIRK (into intercom) Engineering... Status, Mr. Scott? 
SCOTT'S INTERCOM VOICE (somber) We're ready, sir. 
KIRK (into intercom) Thank you, Scotty. Stand by. 
358   ACROSS KIRK TO McCOY                                       358 
as Kirk turns from the intercom and glances at McCoy. Between them a total look of understanding. 
359   EXT. ENTERPRISE (INT. V'GER)                               359 
The Enterprise approaching the edge of the "island" -- slowing, but still quite clearly being pulled by the tractor beam. The "solid matter" in the "island" cen- ter still obscured by the STRANGE LIGHT GLOW emanating from that area. The Enterprise is now nearly at the "island" edge. 
360   INT. BRIDGE - INCLUDING VIEWER                             360 
A sudden STORM OF LIGHT AND STRANGE SOUND. In the midst of it, Kirk finds a SHAFT OF LIGHT very much centering on him. He sees "Ilia" watching him with none of their "former navigator" in her expression now. Kirk hesitates, gathering his thoughts: 
KIRK (to "Ilia") Our data is being prepared. "ILIA" Answer! 
KIRK We will answer and present proof of our answer when it is ready! 
Kirk's words lead to a suggestion of FRUSTRATION in the STORM OF LIGHT AND SOUND around them. 
KIRK (continuing) V'ger, we will bring the Creator to you! Here!

DECKER We need only a few more minutes. Believe me... 
Decker has reached out to touch her -- the probe spins at his touch -- the move knocks Decker from his feet, tumbling, a hard fall. Then the robe looks at him lying there -- just the slightest softening of her features now. 
368   EMPHASIZING DECKER                                         368

as she meets Decker's look, her expression softening still more. The STORM OF LIGHT and SOUND begins to subside a bit. She moves to him and he gets to his feet. 
UHURA'S INTERCOM VOICE Enterprise to Captain... 
370   INT. BRIDGE                                                370 
Uhura with Sulu and Chekov there. 
UHURA Problem, Captain: the response signal is not in our records. Voyager Six was sent out by Earth's "United States Subdivision.' The code was probably... 
371   INT. VOYAGER SIX SITE                                      371 
as Uhura continues: 
UHURA'S INTERCOM VOICE ... kept secret to keep Voyager's data from rival subdivisions. 
McCOY That's preposterous! They wouldn't have kept scientific data from one another. 
CHEKOV'S INTERCOM VOICE We are now checking with Starfleet Archives, Captain. Stand by. 
372   ANGLE ON DECKER AND "ILIA"                                 372 
Kirk, Spock and McCoy are standing some distance from them (out of hearing). The probe is clearly moving into still closer touch with Lt. Ilia's memory patterns as Decker takes her hand. 
DECKER And when V'ger melds? What will happen to you? 
"ILIA" It will... take me from you... 
373   KIRK, SPOCK AND McCOY                                      373 
McCoy is looking at Kirk with an incredulous expression on his face. 
McCOY And when it realizes what the Creator is...? 
KIRK There's no way to know. V'ger expected it to be a machine -- some single entity. (indicates entire site) All of us here may be reduced into patterns... 
SPOCK That seems to be what it has planned -- to have the Creator physically present here. 
McCOY (small smile) The God it captures is going to be a hell of a disappointment. 
374   DECKER AND "ILIA"                                          374 
at the side of Voyager Six, Decker in the midst of twisting a wing-nut which releases a hatch which swings open. Decker peers inside while "Ilia" waits. 
375   KIRK, SPOCK AND McCOY                                      375 
Decker and "Ilia" at the old capsule in b.g. as Kirk looks that way. 
KIRK Commander... 
We SEE Decker look up at Kirk's call, then ignore him and go back to inspecting inside the access hatch. At this moment, from Kirk's communicator, a SIGNAL. 
KIRK (continuing; into communicator) Kirk here. 
UHURA'S INTERCOM VOICE We now have the response code, sir. 
KIRK Stand by. Transmit it on my orders. 
The three of them exchange looks -- Kirk, Spock and McCoy exchanging a silent moment of friendship and resignation. Then Kirk lifts his communicator again: 
KIRK (continuing) Enterprise... transmit.

ALMA Right between the shoulder blades. I learned it from your pictures. 
She moves off to the mirror to apply lipstick and Hitchcock surreptitiously picks up the papers again... 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK Where are you off to? 
ALMA I'm seeing Whit for brunch after I drop you off at the studio. Why don't you join us? 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK We've just established that I'm too corpulent to be seen in broad daylight. 
ALMA You'll feel better as soon as you find a project. Hasn't Peggy unearthed any decent books yet? 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK Sleeping pills with dust jackets. 
Alma steps back to inspect herself in the full-length mirror. Today's outfit is, we sense, rather more stylish than what she would ordinarily wear. 
ALMA Well? 
Hitch's gaze never leaves the photo gallery of his younger rivals in the `New Masters of Suspense' article... 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK Very presentable. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (3) 
ON ALMA 
As she elegantly masks her hurt. 
ALMA Hurry up, darling. You're pruning. 
She leaves. Hitch grumbles and tosses his paper aside. He rises from the depths but suddenly loses his balance and grabs onto the SHOWER CURTAIN, wrenching it from the METAL RINGS on the rod. 
A GOD'S EYE view, looking down, as Hitchcock stares up at the metal rings SPINNING NOISILY on the metal rod. 
EXT. THE PARAMOUNT STUDIOS, BRONSON GATE - DAY 
The FAMOUS MOUNTAIN TOP icon looms large. TWO GUARDS snap-to for the arrival of Hollywood royalty. 
FIRST GUARD Mr. Hitchcock. Mrs. Hitchcock. 
Alma waves from the wheel of a GLEAMING BLACK 1957 CADILLAC. Hitchcock sits next to her. He has his two SEALYHAM TERRIERS on his lap. He nods, awaiting more. 
FIRST GUARD (CONT'D) (to the dogs) Sirs. 
EXT. PARAMOUNT STUDIOS, PRODUCERS' BUILDING - DAY 
The Cadillac pulls up. Alma notes Hitchcock's look of frustrated envy as CREW MEMBERS bustle in and out of STAGE 15. It's a hive of activity. 
ALMA There's a story out there waiting for you somewhere, Hitch. I promise. 
He gives her a good-bye peck and opens the door. 
ALMA (CONT'D) Don't forget your lunch. 
Alma hands him a compact Fortnum & Mason basket and pats him on his girth. He opens it to discover CELERY AND CARROT STICKS wrapped in Saran. 
OMITTED INT. HITCHCOCK'S OFFICE, PARAMOUNT - DAY 
Luxurious, wood-paneled and very British. Hitch sits restlessly behind his desk, receiving his morning shave from his private barber, SILVIO. His longtime assistant, PEGGY ROBERTSON, 40s, crisp, British, fiercely protective of her boss, is going through a list of potential projects. 
PEGGY Fox is offering you The Diary of Anne Frank for the third time. 
Hitch directs his response to Silvio. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK The audience would spend the entire picture waiting for Miss Frank to discover the corpse I'd hidden in the attic. Wouldn't you agree, Silvio? 
SILVIO Si. 
Hitch reaches for a carrot stick and CRUNCHES it. 
PEGGY MGM wants you for the Ian Fleming book, Casino Royale, with Cary Grant. Definitely your style. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (again, turning to Silvio) Doesn't she know I just made that movie? It's called North by Northwest. And "style" is merely self-plagiarism. 
Silvio nods, then recommences the shave. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) I'm treading water, Peggy. I need something fresh. Something different. Without expensive stars like Cary Grant or Miss Kim Novak to pretty it up. 
Silvio unintentionally nicks Hitch's face. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) A nice, clean, nasty little piece of work. 
Silvio hurriedly dabs away a speck of BLOOD. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
He drains it playfully. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK Gin. Mother's ruin. 
But something's caught his eye. A circled review of Anthony Boucher's column "CRIMINAL MINDS" in the New York Times Review of Books. He picks it up. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) Boucher says this "Psycho" book by Robert Bloch is `fiendishly entertaining'. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
PEGGY It sounds ghastly. Everyone in town's already passed. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK And who is everyone? 
PEGGY The story department finished the coverage this morning. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK Is this the one based on Ed Gein, the serial killer? 
He takes the coverage and reads for himself. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) "Graphic elements of brutal violence, voyeurism, transvestitism and incest." Certainly not your average run of the mill nutcase, is he? 
He gives a grunt of approval. 
PEGGY You're kidding. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK Peggy. This is the boy who dug up his own mother. 
INT. HITCHCOCK'S STUDY - THE NEXT NIGHT 
ON HITCH 
Completely engrossed as he sits reading "Psycho" in a chair by the fire of his elegant Bel Air home. He takes another gulp of wine when he hears Alma enter and slides the wine glass out of view. Alma pops her head in the door. 
ALMA Hungry? 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK Famished. 
She disappears to take off her coat. 
ALMA (O.S.) If you're good, maybe you can have a grapefruit later. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
She comes back in again carrying some galleys, notices the title of Hitch's book -- some trash called "Psycho." 
ALMA (CONT'D) Whit gave me the galleys of his new book yesterday at lunch. I've already got some ideas on how you could adapt it. 
Hitch continues reading. 
ALMA (CONT'D) It's elegant, sophisticated, full of INTRIGUE -- 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK The book or Mr. Whitfield Cook? 
She taps Hitch's book dismissively with the galleys of "Taxi to Dubrovnik." 
ALMA This might be the one, Alfred. 
He finally looks up. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK Leave it on the night stand. 
As she leaves she points to Hitch's `hidden' wine glass. 
ALMA There are calories in that, you know. 
But Hitch ignores her and turns to look out the window, his imagination starting to turn... 
INT. GEIN HOUSE, PLAINVIEW, 1945 - NIGHT 
Ed enters the bedroom. His mother, Augusta, is in the bed, faced away from him. 
ED GEIN Aren't you cold, ma? 
She doesn't answer. We follow him to the dresser where he lingers a little too long over his mother's open underwear drawer before grabbing the blue coverlet on the side. 
He comes over and spreads the extra blanket over her. Still wearing his jacket, he takes off his shoes, gets into bed and crawls up next to her. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
ED GEIN (CONT'D) Don't be afraid, ma... I'm here... 
As he puts his arm around her and pulls her close, we reveal his mother's ghoulishly embalmed face. 
INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, BEDROOM - NIGHT 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (PRE-LAP) (CONT'D) ..they opened the door only to discover - voila... 
He produces the manila envelope from behind his back and empties THE HORRIFICALLY GORY CRIME SCENE PHOTOGRAPHS inside onto the coffee table. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) ... Ten female heads with the tops sawn off, a dozen masks of human skin, and a pair of lips on a drawstring for a window shade. 
Hitch looks down sweetly at the circle of quietly horrified expressions... 
HEDDA HOPPER TYPE Is this really going to be you're next picture, Mr. Hitchcock? 
HITCHCOCK That is my intention, madam. Yes. 
Hitch taps the photo of ED GEIN. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK I only wish he looked more like William Holden and less like Elmer Fudd. 
The other columnists scribble down the quote. 
HEDDA HOPPER TYPE Am I the only one who finds this offensive? 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK I was hoping everyone would. I mean life is deeply offensive and disgusting, isn't it? 
Hitch glides off without missing a beat, past the Servers arriving with more hors d'oeuvres from the kitchen. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) Try the finger sandwiches -- they're real fingers. 
He snags a martini and collars Peggy while he's at it. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) Peggy. I'm going to need some research detailing a typical unmarried 30-year-old secretary from Phoenix, Arizona. 
He looks over at the pantry, where Alma can be glimpsed through the swinging door, putting food onto trays. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) Her monthly rent, what she wears, what she reads, which scent or perfume she prefers... 
Hitch sees WHIT lean into view and innocently whisper something into Alma's ear making her laugh. 
PEGGY ... How she deals with a demanding boss when she's trying to relax on her weekends off? 
Hitchcock doesn't notice the joke. He now only has eyes on the pantry ahead. 
He forges on through the guests only to get waylaid by Lew. It is a classic Hitchcock moment, a character needing to get someplace being held up by someone who wants to chat -- 
LEW WASSERMAN (re: the faces of the GOSSIP COLUMNISTS) I told you, Hitch. This thing's strictly for the drive-in crowd. 
Hitch smiles tightly and extricates himself, heading on to the kitchen through more annoying guests -- 
INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, PANTRY - SIMULTANEOUS 
Whit leans against the stove watching Alma expertly arrange the next round of hors d'oeuvres coming in from the kitchen. 
WHITFIELD COOK Now, if this were a Hitchcock picture what would two characters like us, married to other people, be saying? 
ALMA You don't have to pretend you're not upset he hasn't read it yet, you know. 
WHITFIELD COOK I'm a big boy. I can take it. 
ALMA Well, I loved it. What terrific fun it must have been to research. 
WHITFIELD COOK Certainly more fun than reading those reviews. (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
WHITFIELD COOK (CONT'D) (THEN) Do you think he really will read it? 
Suddenly, over Whitfield's shoulder, Alma sees Hitch looming in the doorway. Whit notes the tiny change in her eyes and turns. 
WHITFIELD COOK (CONT'D) Speak of the devil. 
Hitch stares blankly at him while Alma turns and busies herself over the sink, hiding an almost imperceptible blush. 
WHITFIELD COOK (CONT'D) I have to admit, Hitch, I ran all over town looking for a copy of "Psycho" but couldn't find a single one. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK I wonder how that could have happened. 
Hitch sips his martini, a picture of innocence. Then leans in to Whit's ear and whispers - just like Whit leaned into Alma's ear a moment earlier. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) Don't stop looking on my behalf. 
Peggy appears in the pass-through, beckoning Hitch to hurry back into the living room. 
INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
ALMA You're back early. 
He shrugs, then sits at the table to pour himself a glass of lemonade. Alma gets out and towels herself off. 
ALMA (CONT'D) I'm disappointed you didn't give Whit's book a chance. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK What about him? 
ALMA He knows you well enough. 
She sits down next to him, noticing a tiny hole in her swimsuit. It's starting to look a little threadbare. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK Enjoy the pool now. We might not have it for that much longer. 
He looks off cryptically. 
ALMA Why? 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK Paramount refuses to finance the movie. Imagine -- The studio that brought you Martin and Lewis and The Greatest Show On Earth considers Psycho distasteful. 
He brushes some fallen leaves off his chair. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) Lew can't find the money. Not quickly enough at least. 
ALMA Why not wait? 
He doesn't reply. She knows him well enough too and doesn't question him further. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK We're going to have to go it alone, old girl. (BEAT) We'll finance the movie ourselves. 
ALMA Are we going to have to sell the entire house or just the pool? 
She looks at Hitch but he's not joking. She turns to survey their beloved home and gardens. 
A long pause. 
ALMA (CONT'D) Tell me and I won't ever ask again. Why this one, Hitch? It's not just because so many people are telling you 'no,' is it? 
Pause. 
ALMA (CONT'D) Hitch? 
Without turning he takes her hand. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK Remember the fun we had when we started out and there was so little money and time? We took risks, we experimented. We invented new ways of making pictures because we had to. 
A long moment as he gazes across the pool. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) I want to feel that kind of freedom again. 
He turns to look into her eyes for the first time. A glimpse of the real Hitchcock. Someone even his wife doesn't see that often... 
EXT. PARAMOUNT STUDIOS - DAY 
The famous gates and the executive building beyond it. 
LEW WASSERMAN (PRE-LAP) Barney, we're about to propose a restructured deal for "Psycho"... 
INT. BALABAN'S PRIVATE OFFICE, PARAMOUNT - DAY 
Balaban watches Hitchcock and Lew closely. Hitchcock again is like a waxworks Buddha, revealing nothing. 
LEW WASSERMAN We finance it. Independently. Paramount only distributes it...in exchange for 40 percent of the profits. 
BARNEY BALABAN Interesting. But tell us, what exactly is Paramount distributing? Is this still a picture about a queer killing people in his mother's dress? 
LEW WASSERMAN What this picture is about is the reputation of Alfred Hitchcock. 
BARNEY BALABAN No-one's arguing that. 
LEW WASSERMAN Barney, it's very simple. This is Mr. Hitchcock's next film. Are you in or are you out? 
A long silence. 
BARNEY BALABAN Well, obviously you have a lot of passion for this project. Let me talk it over with a few people internally and I'll get back to you. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
LEW WASSERMAN No. Now. 
Balaban takes in their inscrutable stares. Not unimpressed by their chutzpah, he leans back and puts his hands behind his head, a king in his counting room. 
He shuts the door. Leans against the fridge door. Hitch waits but she gives nothing away...until she off-handedly places the pages on the table... 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK Well? 
She doesn't look up... 
ALMA Hire him. 
INT. UNKNOWN ROOM - DAY 
Close on a blank page being fed into a Corona typewriter. FINGERS pound out "PSYCHO" 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
BY JOSEPH STEFANO. 
EXT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE - MORNING 
The door opens and Hitchs step outside. The Cadillac is waiting. 
Alma follows him out and makes a final adjustment to his tie. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK The only thing worse than a visit to the dentist is one to the censor. 
ALMA Whatever you do, Alfred, don't lose your temper. 
INT. PRODUCTION CODE ADMINISTRATION OFFICE - DAY 
The intimidating plaque for the MPAA's "PRODUCTION CODE ADMINISTRATION OFFICE" on the wall. 
Stefano's TITLE PAGE is tapped angrily by GEOFFREY SHURLOCK, 70s, the much-feared administrator for the Motion Picture Production Code. He sits at the head of a big table with TWO ASSISTANTS. Sitting opposite are Hitchcock, Peggy and several silent PARAMOUNT EXECUTIVES. 
GEOFFREY SHURLOCK The Code will absolutely not permit you to show a knife penetrating a woman's flesh. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK I assure you, Geoffrey, my murders, are always models of taste and discretion. 
GEOFFREY SHURLOCK Is there any improper suggestion of nudity in this murder scene in the shower? 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK She won't be nude. She'll be wearing a shower cap. 
Shurlock makes a note. A man utterly devoid of any sense of humor. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
GEOFFREY SHURLOCK We might accept a shot from outside the bathroom window with Marion in silhouette above the shoulders -- provided the glass is frosted. 
Hitch greets the suggestion with barely concealed contempt. Shurlock turns the page. 
G EOFFREY SHURLOCK Then -- this scene with the toilet. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK It's completely necessary. Marion flushes evidence later found by her sister. It's a clue to the girl's disappearance. 
GEOFFREY SHURLOCK No American movie has ever found it "necessary" to show a toilet, let alone to flush it. 
Hitch turns to Peggy and a Paramount Executive. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK Perhaps we ought to shoot the film in France and use a bidet instead? 
No response from Shurlock's end of the room. Peggy stares down at the table. 
GEOFFREY SHURLOCK Mr. Hitchcock, if this office denies you a seal, and we're certainly heading in that direction, your movie will not be released in a single theater in this country. Will you be making jokes then? 
Hitchcock gives a slow but meaningful shrug. 
GEOFFREY SHURLOCK (CONT'D) Good. Now why don't we go all the way back to page two... 
ON HITCH 
boiling with rage as we hear the flurry of script pages -- 
INT. PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE, BEVERLY HILLS - DAY 
Sunlight filters through sheer curtains revealing Hitchcock trying his best to recline on an ANALYST'S COUCH. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK Everyone in Hollywood resents me. I make them millions... and yet every year I sit at those dreadful award show dinners, waiting for them to say, just once, "You're good." 
He looks around the luxurious office. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) They take sadistic pleasure in denying me that one little moment. 
ANALYST'S VOICE That must hurt. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK Deeply. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK How so? 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
Hitch's calmness is strangely reassuring to the young actor... 
ANTHONY PERKINS I was incredibly close to my mother. So close I remember wishing my father would drop dead. And then when I was five, he did just that...He keeled over from a heart attack. (LAUGHING NERVOUSLY) You see I've been guilty my whole life, Mr. Hitchcock. 
Hitch is enthralled. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK Try to remember this is all just make believe. 
Perkins wishes he could be more reassured... 
ANTHONY PERKINS Not to be prudish, but how far do you plan to push Norman's relationship with his mother? 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK Further than you can possibly imagine. 
On Perkins uncertain expression -- what is he letting himself in for? 
EXT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, GARDEN - DAY 
Hitchcock's RED SWEATING FACE as he grunts and heaves. He's dressed in gardening gear, laboring in the full bloom of the rose garden. Alma pushes a WHEELBARROW filled with manure. 
She shovels the manure around the rosebushes. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK I'm getting blisters just looking at you. 
ALMA Stop grumbling. A bit of fresh air and exercise is exactly what you need. 
He holds his PRUNING SHEARS menacingly over a deep red Sydonie rose. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK If I could get Grace Kelly to play the girl, they'd let me get away with anything. 
ALMA Well you can't. She's a princess now which makes her permanently unattainable. 
Hitchcock beheads the ROSE, muttering to himself. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK And all the more desirable. 
His shears are now poised over a yellow specimen. 
ALMA Lew suggested Deborah Kerr. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK Too... Scottish. 
Hitchcock cuts it too and moves on to the stem of a perfect pink rose. 
ALMA What about Janet Leigh? She's always the `good girl' but she did awfully well in Touch of Evil. Lew mentioned her name. Do you remember how you always remarked on her figure at the Wassermans' parties? 
As the shears hover on the stem, unsure whether to cut... 
MATCH CUT TO: 
INT. CHASEN'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
THE SLENDER WAIST AND AMPLE BOSOM OF JANET LEIGH as she elegantly enters the dining room of Chasen's. 
Hitch stands to greet her, his eyes follow her across the room in some private rapture.. 
Alma watches as Janet removes her glove and shakes Hitch's hand...before he guides her to the spot to his left, across from Alma. 
INT. CHASEN'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
Hitch finishes telling his story... 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK Of course the real secret of Mrs. Simpson's appeal to the Duke of Windsor was that she could make a toothpick feel like a cigar. 
He's so deadpan... it takes a moment before she laughs. 
JANET LEIGH You know, I've been so immersed in preparing to play Marion I'd almost forgotten how to laugh. 
Hitch summons the waiter with a snap. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK Now, you must try the banana shortcake. 
JANET LEIGH Nothing for me, thank you. I'm watching my figure. 
Alma watches all this with a fixed smile. 
ALMA You're not the only one. (to the waiter) We're fine, thank you. 
INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, KITCHEN - MORNING 
A vase of flowers, none of them pink, in the center of the table. Hitch STARES into a refrigerator filled with boring tasteless health-conscious food. 
Alma enters briskly and holds up a handwritten LIST. 
ALMA I've made a list of places where we can tighten our belt. 
She places the list on the table. 
ALMA (CONT'D) It wouldn't hurt for us all to learn the art of self restraint. 
Hitch goes over and picks it up, and reads. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK The gardeners only once a week and weekends off for the driver? No. Absolutely not. We'll find other places to cut. 
ALMA There aren't any other places. And furthermore, they'll be no more shipments from Maxim's either. We can't afford it. 
She snatches the list out of his hand. 
ALMA (CONT'D) The foie gras at Chasen's is more than adequate. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK But those geese are from Barstow not Marseilles. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
She turns back to him. 
ALMA We all have to make our little sacrifices for the greater good, don't we, Alfred? 
She leaves Hitch to resume contemplating the contents of the fridge...but there's nothing there to satisfy his growling hunger. He SLAMS the fridge and -- 
INT. ED GEIN'S HOUSE - DAY 
Suddenly we're moving through an empty living room, prowling, just like in a Hitchcock movie as we hear CLUNKING, then move over to catch a glimpse of Ed as he drags A WOMAN'S BODY, feet-first up the stairs. The clunking is from her head on the steps, which is wrapped in her dress. 
INT. ED GEIN'S HOUSE, BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Ed approaches the shower curtain, then yanks it open with a METALLIC SCREECH. He pushes the body into the tub. Pulls the dress off her head and drops it on the floor. 
ED GEIN Stay here. I'm going to get the knives. 
We pan to REVEAL HITCHCOCK standing in the corner. He looks terrified but completely enthralled -- he can't resist creeping forward for a thorough inspection. Hitch's POV as he steps closer to the tub and glimpses the woman's blood- spattered WHITE BRA and GIRDLE. 
Suddenly -- FINGERS CLUTCH the rim of the tub. 
DEAD WOMAN Help me. 
Hitch recoils but she LURCHES UP and GRABS his throat. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK Ed! Ed! 
SMASH CUT TO: 
INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Hitchcock bolts upright in bed, face beaded with sweat in the moonlight. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK Ed... Ed...? 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
It takes a moment to get his bearings. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) Am I making a mistake? 
Alma stirs in her bed. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) What if it's another Vertigo? 
ALMA Oh, shut up. Just get the first take under your belt you'll be fine. 
But Hitch isn't looking convinced. 
EXT. SOUNDSTAGE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - DAY 
A sign posted outside the soundstage reads, "PRODUCTION REHEARSALS 9401. ABSOLUTELY NO VISITORS!" It only makes passing REPORTERS AND WORKERS more curious. 
INT. SOUNDSTAGE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - CONTINUOUS 
Inside, it's a hive of quiet purposeful activity. A.D. HILTON GREEN escorts VERA MILES across the far side of the stage. She's 30, a classic blonde porcelain beauty in the Grace Kelly mold. 
PEGGY I still can't believe you cast Vera Miles as the sister. 
Hitch sits in his director's chair reading a copy of the London Times. 
As he escorts her onto the soundstage, Tony comes up to greet them. 
ANTHONY PERKINS I want to thank you again for this opportunity, Mr. Hitchcock. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK It's just "Hitch", Tony. Hold the cock. 
Janet caught that -- she's clearly amused. Tony gives her a gracious peck on the cheek. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) Look at you two. America's favorite boy and girl nextdoor... 
Janet flicks a glance back at Hitch. 
JANET LEIGH And we're about to move to a whole new neighborhood. 
Already, Tony can't help feel a little excluded from Hitch and Janet's little clique. Hitch ushers them across the soundstage where the crew are assembling. 
VERA MILES Morning Janet. Morning Tony. 
Vera Miles marches up in her frumpy tweed suit and wig. 
VERA MILES (CONT'D) "Thanks" for the wardrobe, Hitch. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (already moving past her) That's hand-woven imported camel hair from Rodier. Don't you approve? 
VERA MILES You're the genius. 
She checkmates him with a ravishing smile. 
VERA MILES (CONT'D) One thing, though. My script is missing the last ten pages. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK Everyone's is. Until Alma finishes the revisions. Now hurry along, Vera. You're just in time for the oath. 
VERA MILES The what? 
He steers her towards a line of laughing CREW MEMBERS forming a circle with the rest of the cast. 
He takes Janet by the hand, placing her right next to him and officiously raises his right hand. The cast and crew duly follow suit, all except for Vera. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK I solemnly promise... 
CREW I solemnly promise... 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (ignoring Vera's sarcasm) That I will not divulge the plot nor the many secrets of Psycho... 
CREW That I will not divulge the plot nor the many secrets of Psycho... 
WE SEE VERA'S CROSSED FINGERS BEHIND HER BACK 
Then tilt up to Janet's look of mock disapproval. Vera pokes her tongue out. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK To friends, relatives, trade reporters or columnists -- not even to outgoing President Dwight D. Eisenhower, God bless him. 
Everyone cracks up, but Hitchcock's only interested in the reaction of his new blonde, standing in pride of place, right beside him. 
INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, KITCHEN - SAME TIME 
ALMA sits at the desk typing away at the revisions for "Psycho." -- we see the title page. 
A tiny solitary figure with nothing for company but a vase of wilting flowers... 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
She pauses, takes off her glasses and pushes aside her corrections, suddenly fed up with the all the work. 
She looks out at the swimming pool, sparkling in the sunlight... then turns to the expensive-looking SHOPPING BAG half-open on the side... 
We hear a LOUD SPLASH -- 
EXT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, POOL - DAY 
As Alma plunges into the water wearing her striking new swimsuit. She breaks into a front crawl. Her strokes are vigorous, surprisingly so. 
She drives the length of the pool, her arms slashing through the water with increasing speed, her feet kicking out with rising intensity... harder and harder... faster and faster... 
INT. SOUNDSTAGE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - DAY 
Hitch guides Janet and Tony across the sound stage to the set of Norman's parlor. 
ANTHONY PERKINS Now, Hitch, explain to me why I'm watching Marion undress? 
JANET LEIGH I feel like I should take offense at that. 
She and Tony laugh. Hitch's eyes light up at this display of mischief from her. 
JANET This is the brand I wear. 
Hitch digests the information and turns to Rita. 
HITCHCOCK We're ready for a fitting. 
As Rita starts to measure Janet's chest, Hitchcock lifts his hands and `frames' her... 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (V.O. PRE-LAP) We travel across the rooftops of downtown Phoenix and finally, through the heat, pick out a certain hotel window... 
INT. SOUNDSTAGE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - DAY 
Close on Hitchcock's FRAMING HANDS as they now travel up to an open window with blinds half down... 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK We go under the blinds and match dissolve into the room itself... INT. SOUNDSTAGE, BEDROOM SET - LATER 
HITCHCOCK'S HANDS have now become THE CAMERA, recording the scene already underway and now watched by HITCHCOCK, his DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY and CREW from across the stage... 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (V.O.) We pan over and discover John and Janet on the bed. 
...the camera moves to Janet and John making out on the bed. It's serious stuff. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) She'll be wearing only her undergarments and a large glow of satisfaction... 
JANET smiles up at John contentedly. 
ON HITCH 
watching from his directing chair. Peggy stands next to him. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) Cut. 
PEGGY Good luck getting this one past the censor. 
EXT. STUDIO GATES, UNIVERSAL REVUE - DAY 
Alma drives the gleaming black Cadillac through the UNIVERSAL GATES and pulls up to the production office outside the stage. 
EXT. HITCHCOCK OFFICE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - DAY 
Alma collects the script pages off the front seat and walks into the production office just missing Whit as he strolls back towards the writers building with a couple of pretty SECRETARIES. 
Whit pauses when he spots the Hitchcocks' CADILLAC. 
WHITFIELD COOK You girls go on ahead. 
The PRETTIEST ONE stops to make Whit light her cigarette before catching up with the others. INT. HITCHCOCK OFFICE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - DAY 
Peggy reads the final pages while Alma inspects the production boards. 
PEGGY If you ask me, the credits should read "Screenplay by Joseph Stefano and Alma Reville." 
ALMA The people who matter know. That's all that counts. 
As she makes a few more changes to the schedule. Alma turns to Peggy whose face tightens as she continues reading. Clearly it's strong stuff. 
PEGGY I'd hate to see Shurlock's face when he reads this. 
She puts the pages down. 
PEGGY (CONT'D) Alma, you always know the answer. Is this really going to work? 
A candid moment between the two women... but Alma doesn't answer, just leaves. 
EXT. HITCHCOCK OFFICE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - DAY 
Alma emerges into the sunshine and looks across at the soundstage, wondering whether she should go over there... 
WHITFIELD COOK Hello, stranger. 
She turns to see Whit leaning against the Cadillac. 
ALMA Whit. 
WHITFIELD COOK Where have you been hiding yourself? 
ALMA I've been doing the revisions on... 
She points to the PSYCHO HOUSE on the ridge. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
WHITFIELD COOK Psycho. (THEN) And how is the old boy? 
ALMA In a state of unbridled ecstacy now that he's back on the set. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (PRE-LAP) You think you can get away with it but you can't... 
Alma's eyes become HITCHCOCK'S EYES, staring ahead intently. INT. SOUNDSTAGE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - CAR SCENE - DAY 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK ... You think they can't tell... but they can. They know. It's all closing in on you. The noose is tightening... 
As he continues, we pull back and see: 
THE REAR-PROJECTION SET 
Janet emotes for Hitchcock's CAMERA while "driving" a PARTIAL CAR, being rocked by STAGE HANDS. 
Peggy and other CREW time and mark the takes. ELECTRICIANS AND GAFFERS turn mounted lamps that rake across Janet's worried face like car headlights. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) You could return the money secretly, but what would be the point? 
He wipes his brow, getting more intense... 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) You, Marion Crane. The prim and proper girl who's always been so tight and respectable. So perfect and untouchable. Well, they know all about your dirty little secret, don't they? Your messy, sticky lunchtime trysts. Yes, your boss Mr. Lowery could even smell the sex on YOU-- 
SUDDENLY THE REAR SCREEN film breaks and a frame burns. 
It's a good thing because Janet is starting to look a little uncomfortable -- was that meant to be funny? As technicians yell and hustle, Hitchcock turns to Peggy -- 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) Circle that. 
INT. JANET LEIGH'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY 
As Janet gets changed, Vera hangs up her frumpy coat on a rack, looking over a little enviously at Janet's good girl/bad girl underwear hanging nearby. 
VERA MILES Have you talked to him much about your personal life? 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
JANET LEIGH Not really... 
VERA MILES I'd keep it that way if I were you. (Off Janet's look) He starts by choosing your hairstyle and clothes and then he wants to choose your friends and decide how many children you should have. 
Janet finds this a little hard to believe. Vera leans in, lowering her voice. 
VERA MILES (CONT'D) That poor, tortured soul Jimmy Stewart played in Vertigo? That's Hitch, only younger, slimmer and better-looking. 
That may well be true but it doesn't bother Janet. 
JANET LEIGH Compared to Orson Welles, he's a sweetheart. 
They both turn, sensing something -- and see HITCHCOCK'S DISTINCTIVE SHADOW PROFILE in the hallway. The shadow lingers, then recedes like in a scary ghost story. 
VERA MILES (WHISPERS) See? He's always watching. 
They laugh nervously. 
INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME 
Alma comes in from her gardening, and settles on the sofa with a cup of tea, a circled copy of TV Guide next to her. 
On television -- the 1950 Hitchcock classic Stage Fright. The credits come up: "Screenplay by Whitfield Cook, Adaptation by Alma Reville." 
Alma watches, thrilled at the sight of her name and Whit's together. 
ON THE TV 
The words "DIRECTED BY ALFRED HITCHCOCK" overwhelm the small screen. Alms puts down her fork, no longer hungry. INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, HALLWAY - DAY 
ALMA heads back to the kitchen, only to pause at the open door to Hitch's study -- there's something on the desk. 
INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, STUDY - CONTINUOUS 
THE HITCHCOCK BLONDES 
Hitch's personal collection. Alma enters and starts to go through them. Each photo is turned over a little more roughly than the last. It's hard to tell whether she's more angry at the photos or the fact that they've been deliberately left for her to find... 
Alma takes off an earring, picks up the phone and starts to dial... 
INT. SOUNDSTAGE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - SAME TIME 
As the crew prepares the car set to go again, Hitch strides over to PEGGY who's dialing a phone. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK What's the hold up? 
PEGGY It's still engaged. 
He takes the phone himself just as Vera Miles emerges from her dressing room, script in hand. 
VERA MILES Hitch, I'm stuck on Lila's first scene. I don't know how strongly I should confront Sam and the detective and I -- 
JANET LEIGH My mother always said, "Have confidence in yourself and you can lick anything." 
Hitchcock takes Janet's hand, and with tremendous sincerity : 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK My mother used to say the same thing. (THEN) Let's go for a take. Quiet everyone. 
Over and over, Margo attacks with the knife and Janet tries deflecting the blows but both women are timid and Janet is clearly guarding her modesty and covering her body. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) Cut. More intensely. Let's go again. 
Margo's KNIFE comes at Janet uncertainly and every which way. Naked and exposed, Janet defends against the knife blows as they come at her but Margo's still pulling her punches-- 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) No. More angry. You are possessed with unbridled homicidal rage. (LEAPING UP) Cut. Cut camera. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) 
He charges over to Margo to demonstrate the savage stabbing gesture he demands. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) Does no one understand what I'm trying to accomplish here? I'm older than anyone on this stage and I'm still standing. 
Everyone falls silent, unsure how to respond. Hitchcock HOLDS OUT HIS HAND. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) Give me the knife. 
Margo places the knife in Hitchcock's palm. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) Props. Bring in more blood. 
A FEMALE MAKEUP ASSISTANT squirts more CHOCOLATE SYRUP "blood" onto Janet from a PLASTIC BOTTLE OF BOSCO. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) Roll camera. 
As the scene is marked, we see Hitchcock's anxiety. There is NO SOUND except Hitchcock's ragged breathing. 
CREW MEMBER Ready, sir. 
Hitchcock nods. The camera whirs. Hitchcock hoists the knife into the air with terrifyingly convincing power and malevolence. 
THE SHOWER CURTAIN GETS YANKED BACK -- 
We see in the shower from Hitchcock's POV not Janet but GEOFFREY SHURLOCK. Hitchcock SLASHES the censor a killer blow that sends him reeling. 
THE SHOWER CURTAIN GETS YANKED BACK AGAIN -- 
Shurlock is replaced by BARNEY BALABAN. Hitchcock stabs him with unleashed fury and hate. 
THE SHOWER CURTAIN GETS YANKED BACK AGAIN -- 
WHIT turns, he's naked and smiling. Hitch plunges the knife into his back, and he drops, revealing ALMA, arms around his waist. THE SHOWER CURTAIN GETS YANKED BACK AGAIN -- 
We're back in the real moment -- JANET LEIGH SCREAMING as she gives the `performance' of a lifetime. 
Hitchcock stops stabbing. His heart pounds. He's soaked with sweat. The only sound is the drip-drip-drip of the shower... 
ON HITCH 
As he realizes EVERYONE is staring at him. He straightens his tie, attempting to regain some semblance of control. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK Print. We've got it. 
He exits quickly. 
Rita escorts the shaken and exhausted Janet off set, passing Vera who's witnessed the whole thing. She's wearing a bathrobe. Janet gives her a look as if to say `Now I understand.' 
INT. HITCHCOCK'S OFFICE - UNIVERSAL REVUE - CONTINUOUS 
Hitch shuts his office door and leans back against it. He closes his eyes, nauseated and dizzy. He doesn't even need to open them to know who's there, waiting for him. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK Not now, Ed. It's really not a good time. 
He staggers towards the water cooler, fumbling for a cup. 
Ed steps forward and pours him some water, pats his shoulder. 
ED GEIN You just can't keep this stuff bottled up. 
But before Hitch can drink it he crashes to the floor. 
EXT. HITCHCOCK'S OFFICE - UNIVERSAL REVUE - SAME TIME 
Peggy and Perkins to react to the noise... 
HITCHCOCK'S OFFICE - UNIVERSAL REVUE - SAME TIME 
They come through the door to see Hitch lying on the floor. He looks like he's dead. 
Still clutching the phone, a little nonplussed. Peggy gives him a look: "What did I tell you." 
INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, BEDROOM - SAME TIME 
Alma removes the phone from Hitch's grasp. Touches his forehead. 
ALMA No more phone calls. You're burning up. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK Burning up our money. We're two days behind and I'm stuck in bed. 
Hitch swings his legs out of the bed. 
ALMA Where do you think you're going? 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK To the set. We can't afford to lose any more time. Two more days of this and the whole production goes under. 
He shakily tries to get to his feet. 
ALMA You stay in bed. I'll deal with it. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK I'd hate to take you away from your writing partner. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
She pushes him back against the pillows. He's too weak to resist. 
ALMA Under the blankets. Now. 
INT. SOUNDSTAGE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - DAY 
Crew members sit around eating donuts. Assistant director Hilton Green and cameraman Jack Russell are still arguing over the mechanics of the shot with more crew members joining in. It's near pandemonium. 
Then Alma steps in the door, and everything stops. Every crew member snaps to attention as Alma passes by. It's like the school principal arriving after the substitute teacher has lost control. 
ALMA Don't stop work because of me. I'm only here as one of the two people paying your salaries. 
Alma takes a seat in Hitch's DIRECTOR'S chair. As her eyes dart around the set, it's clear that she IS TAKING EVERYTHING IN. Peggy flanks her. 
ALMA (CONT'D) Scene? 
PEGGY One seventy three. 
ALMA Storyboards? 
Peggy hands the boards to Alma. She and Hilton quickly review the boards. 
ALMA (CONT'D) Start with the overhead. We'll cut before the fall. Then we'll put Martin in a chair under the camera. 
Hilton looks at Russell. Perfect. He sets ANTHONY PERKINS in his dress into place. 
ALMA (CONT'D) (to the cameraman) And that lens should be a thirty-five. 
Peggy mouths Alma a silent "THANK YOU" for restoring order. INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, BEDROOM - DAY 
Hitchcock lies in bed, tossing and turning, the fever only making his thoughts darker and more obsessive. 
ED GEIN (O.S.) You forgot to look in the bathroom. 
Hitch notices the SHADOWY FIGURE standing at the end of his bed. 
ED GEIN (CONT'D) A man like you... Missing the vital clue like that... 
He blearily sits up and sees Gein's impassive rustic face. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK What do you mean? 
Gein steps over to the bathroom and pushes open the door. 
ED GEIN My mother always said if you're going to do a job, do it right. 
INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Hitchcock enters the immaculate white and chrome room and inspects it... but nothing seems out of place. 
ED GEIN Check the floor. 
He looks down but again, nothing. 
ED GEIN (CONT'D) Closer. 
Hitch gets down on his hands and knees. He runs his fingertips across the smooth white tiles. They start to COLLECT -- 
GRAINS OF SAND 
Sprinkled all over the floor. 
On the stereo. Alma finds Hitch on the sofa swaddled in a blanket and eating ICE CREAM. 
ALMA May I turn that down? 
She silences the stereo. Hitch doesn't react. 
ALMA (CONT'D) You'll be pleased to know order has been restored. 
He still doesn't look at her, masticating loudly. 
ALMA (CONT'D) A thank you would be nice. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK We're still two days behind and sixty thousand over budget. 
ALMA I already cancelled the wrap party. That'll save us two thousand right there. And you won't be tempted by any champagne and cake. 
She pulls at the bowl of ice cream. He refuses to let go. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK Beware -- all men are potential murderers. 
She yanks it from his grip. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) With good reason. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
ALMA Alright, what's this about? 
He slowly pulls the ASPIRIN BOTTLE from his robe pocket, building suspense as he unscrews the lid and pours SAND into a tiny pile on the coffee table in front of him. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK Spending a lot of time at the beach? 
He puts down the bottle, looking for a reaction. 
ALMA That's where Whit and I are writing. He's rented a place. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK Hardly the ideal setting to avoid distractions. 
ALMA Actually, it's very conducive to creative collaboration. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK I already told you -- that treatment is a waste of time. 
ALMA Didn't everyone say the same thing about "Psycho"? 
She reaches for the ASPIRIN BOTTLE to throw it away but Hitch grabs it first -- 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK Are you and Whit having an affair? 
ALMA Don't be absurd. He's working on something new and needs a little help, that's all. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK What a coincidence. I'm working on something new and I could use a little help too. 
ALMA What do you think I've been doing? 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK Then why are you spending all hours of the day and night with some overage, talentless mamma's boy? 
ALMA Because it's fun. 
He quivers, livid. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK I am under extraordinary pressures on this picture, the least you can do is give me your full support. 
ALMA Full support? We've mortgaged our house. My house. 
Alma's eyes flash with unaccustomed hurt and fury. 
ALMA (CONT'D) Might I remind you that I have weighed-in on every aspect of this film so far, as I have done on every picture you've done in the last three decades. And the first time you show the film, it will be my notes that you want. I celebrate with you if the reviews are good and I cry for you if they are not. I host your parties and put up with those fantasy romances with your leading ladies. And when you're out promoting this film around the world, I will stand beside or, rather, slightly behind you, smiling endlessly for the press even when I'm ready to drop, being gracious to people who look through me as if I were invisible because all they can see is the grand and glorious "Alfred Hitchcock." 
Hitchcock is stunned and silent. 
ALMA (CONT'D) Now, for the first time in years, I dare to work on something that isn't "an Alfred Hitchcock Production" and I'm met with accusation and criticisms. This work I'm doing with Whit gives me pleasure and purpose. (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (3) 
ALMA (CONT'D) And even though that takes absolutely nothing away from you, please consider this a reminder: I am your wife, Alma Reville, not one of the contract blondes you badger and torment with your oh-so- specific direction. 
She turns and, with great dignity, leaves Hitchcock sitting in the gathering gloom. He's not the only one who can deliver a killer blow. 
INT. SOUNDSTAGE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - DAY 
ON HITCH 
with that same lost expression on his face, only now dark shadow and harsh light alternate across his features. 
She starts the car and drives off. 
Whit watches, deflated, knowing he's ruined everything, his receding figure swallowed up by flickering white light... 
INT. SCREENING ROOM, PARAMOUNT STUDIOS - DAY 
WE PLAY THIS SCENE ONLY OVER THE FACES OF A SMALL INVITED AUDIENCE -- THEIR EXPRESSIONS TELL US THAT THE FOOTAGE THEY ARE SEEING IS NOT GOING OVER WELL. NOT AT ALL. 
Lew sits with Barney Balaban and two executives. Lew discreetly checks his watch out of boredom. Shurlock and his two Assistants look appalled. Composer BERNARD HERRMANN, late 40s, prickly, sits in the back row looking suicidal. He glances back at Hitchcock who stands near the screening room door looking worse, if that could be possible. 
EXT. SCREENING ROOM, PARAMOUNT STUDIOS - LATER 
Shurlock exits and approaches Hitchcock who's waiting in the foyer. 
GEOFFREY SHURLOCK You're going to have to cut all that nudity. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK What nudity? It was suggested. 
GEOFFREY SHURLOCK I definitely saw that knife jabbing her. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK We did no such shot. 
GEOFFREY SHURLOCK I'd stake my reputation on it. I'm recommending you cut the shower scene entirely. 
Hitchcock is livid but holds his tongue. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK I'll go over it frame by frame and set up another screening. 
But Shurlock is already walking away... 
Wasserman emerges from the screening room conversing with BALABAN. Hitch searches their expressions for some indication but Balaban strides off without saying a single word to him. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) What's the verdict? 
LEW WASSERMAN Let's just say it was a four-letter review and it wasn't `good'. 
The harsh reality devastates Hitchcock. 
LEW WASSERMAN (CONT'D) Screw him. It's too late for Paramount to back out no matter what Balaban says. 
Hitch just stands there. 
LEW WASSERMAN (CONT'D) The other route is to recut it as a two- parter for the TV series. Because of the budget and the Hitchcock name, we stand a good chance of breaking even. 
Still, Hitch doesn't say a word. 
LEW WASSERMAN (CONT'D) Look, I made Jimmy Stewart a millionaire of Winchester 73 and that was a dog. At least I could sit through your picture. 
Hitch stares bleakly off. He can't help noticing the KIM NOVAK-TYPE he spied on earlier outside, hand in hand and kissing her date. 
LEW WASSERMAN (CONT'D) More importantly, what does Alma think? 
INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY 
Alma sits with the Hitchcocks' ACCOUNTANT going over the books again, looking at the revised figures. They close the books and sit back and look at each other. 
ALMA Is there anything else we can do? 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
Silence. This time he can't bring himself to look her in the eye. 
ACCOUNTANT We'll just have to wait and see how the movie turns out. 
Alma gets up and crosses to the window. Stares out at the pool reflecting a leaden sky... and the clumps of dead leaves floating across its surface... 
ALMA Well, it is only a house. 
INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, STUDY - NIGHT 
The dogs, GEOFFREY and STANLEY, lap away at a water bowl in the study. A splash or two of something is added to the bowl from above. It's being poured from Hitch's brandy glass. 
HITCH 
pours himself another glass, leaving the dogs lapping happily away as he goes over to the Steinway Grand. There's a bank of silver-framed PHOTOS on top. He pauses to take a proper look at them. 
His and Alma's life together in movies. Smiling at Premieres with Cary Grant and Grace Kelly. On vacation with Jimmy and Gloria Stewart. At a black tie event with Ingrid Bergman and Gregory Peck. 
But it's the PHOTOGRAPH tucked away at the back that he wants to see most. 
A BLACK AND WHITE PUBLICITY STILL taken on the set of The Mountain Eagle in 1926. He picks it up and looks at it: 
The young Hitchcock in front of the camera, dramatically calling "Action!" on his first film. His eyes don't have to move far to find ALMA, standing just behind him, making notes on her clipboard, the same intense, serious look on her face. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) Whit isn't worth a damn when he's not working with you. (PAUSE) And neither am I. 
Alma takes in his reflective expression, but says nothing. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) I didn't pull off the picture this time. It just sits there, refusing to come to life. (THEN) There's no other way to say it... It's stillborn. 
ALMA turns away. 
Hitch sits there bereft in the lonely silence. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) I let you down, my love. 
He moves closer and takes her hand. Gives it a small squeeze. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) You deserved better. 
She still doesn't move. After a moment Hitch gets to his feet. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) I'll go and feed Geoffrey and Stanley, shall I. 
He exits with the dogs padding after him. She turns back to the screen and more of that stilted, mannered dialogue. 
Tears well in her eyes. 
EXT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE - NIGHT 
A full moon. The ONLY LIGHT from inside the house is the one in the kitchen. 
We glimpse the figure in the window. A corpulent man in profile, like a Hopper painting. INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, KITCHEN - LATER 
Hitch sits in his nightgown, pushing some VEGETABLES around his plate -- his healthy midnight snack. 
Alma enters in her robe. Hitch watches her. She goes to the fridge, opens the PRODUCE DRAWER and from under the brussel sprouts pulls out a tiny hidden jar of BELUGA CAVIAR. 
She gets the crackers, a plate and a spoon and sits down at the table next to him. 
ALMA I don't think I can stand both of us being maudlin. 
She fixes several crackers, each with an appropriate dollop of caviar on top, and puts the plate in the middle. 
ALMA (CONT'D) There is one solution to all this, you know. 
She offers him one of the crackers. 
ALMA (CONT'D) We could both get to work -- together. 
Tentatively, Hitch accepts it. 
ALMA (CONT'D) That tiresome little Hitchcock imitation I've been helping Whit finish is done. 
Hitch remains quiet, delicately consuming his cracker. 
ALMA (CONT'D) So I suggest, for everyone's sake, we start whipping Psycho into shape tomorrow. You may not be the easiest man to live with but you know how to cut a picture better than anyone. 
Hitch puts the lid back on the caviar. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK Except for you. INT. EDITING ROOM - NEXT DAY 
A series of quick shots as the editing room comes to life : CANS OF FILM ARE BROUGHT IN BY ASSISTANTS, STRIPS OF CELLULOID ARE PULLED OUT, INSPECTED AND MARKED WITH CHALK WHILE OTHERS ARE SPLICED TOGETHER. 
HITCH and editor GEORGE TOMASINI wait quietly like schoolboys, while Alma reviews the footage on the Moviola. 
ALMA You'll need to cut those six or seven frames where she blinks after she's supposed to be dead. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK We've seen the footage a thousand times. She doesn't blink. 
Alma gives him a look ... 
INT. EDITING ROOM - LATER 
FILM HANGS EVERYWHERE IN BINS 
FOUR ASSISTANTS are working on MOVIOLAS. Alma and Hitch work their way down the line, inspecting each new assembly. 
ALMA (FIRST MOVIOLA) Take thirty frames off the head... 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK No, no, the second take, the light is better on his hands. 
ALMA (NEXT MOVIOLA) Only cut back to Janet once the car's already moving. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK Cut it tighter. The minute I lose one person I've lost the whole audience. 
TWO PAIRS OF HANDS. Hitchcock's and Alma's. They work like a pair of twenty-year-olds at a pair of MOVIOLAS cutting the picture. 
ANGLE LOOSENS -- to reveal George Tomasini has dozed off, exhausted. 
Shurlock gestures his staff out. Hitch moves closer. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) I have a modest proposal to make. If you're willing to leave the shower sequence as it is, I will reshoot the opening love scene to your exact specifications. 
Shurlock reacts with surprise. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) In fact, I'd welcome your personal supervision on the set. 
Shurlock is more flattered than he'd care to admit. 
GEOFFREY SHURLOCK My specifications? 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK If only audiences could fully appreciate how tirelessly you work to help us entertain them while protecting them from filth and indecency. 
Shurlock studies Hitchcock's sphinx-like expression. INT. SOUNDSTAGE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - DAY 
Hitchcock and Peggy confer. John Gavin and Janet Leigh, wearing robes, chat while lying on a bed. Crew members wait impatiently. Peggy checks her watch. 
PEGGY He's been harassing you since you announced this project, you invite him to the set, and he doesn't even show up? What did you tell him? 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK That I respected him. Deeply. 
Peggy laughs. Now she understands. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) Ladies and gentleman, that is a wrap. Thank you all. 
The crew starts breaking things down. The actors are baffled. Janet walks over to him. 
JANET LEIGH I thought we were reshooting the scene. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK No need. The charade is over. 
Hitch holds out his arm for her and walks her back to the dressing room. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) See, I wasn't that much of a monster to work with, was I? 
JANET LEIGH Not at all. 
He offers his hand and she shakes it, determined to be professional to the end. 
JANET LEIGH (CONT'D) I just hope I was sufficiently loyal to the cause. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK Worthy of a Purple Heart, my dear. 
She leans in and gives him a peck on the cheek. A moment of unexpected heaven that leaves Hitch speechless. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
She walks away to her dressing room. Hitch watches as she steps inside and closes the door. 
After a moment we hear a PIERCING SCREAM -- 
INT. JANET LEIGH'S DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Janet recoils at the sight of A MRS. BATES PROTOTYPE "PROP MASK" grinning lewdly from her chair, and wearing one of Janet's brassieres. 
Hitchcock peeks inside as crew members come running. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK I hope you don't mind, I told Mrs. Bates she could have your dressing room. 
ON JANET 
She can't believe she's been caught out. She closes the door on everyone... and then after a moment SCREAMS AGAIN... but this time not out of shock. 
INT. HITCHCOCK'S OFFICE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - DAY 
Hitch sweeps in. Lew is waiting for him. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK We have our seal from Shurlock's office. (DEVILISHLY) Now, we lead the lambs to the slaughter. 
Hitch turns to Lew for the latest news. 
LEW WASSERMAN The front office confirmed. They're only opening the movie in two theatres, as we suspected. And no premiere. If we don't get word of mouth we're dead. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK Then we'd better get started. Peggy, take a memo... 
Peggy whips out her steno pad. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) We're going to write a manual on exactly how to sell Psycho. INT. PRINTING PRESS - DAY 
BOOKLETS make the rounds on a conveyor-like contraption. As the booklets are bound by swift-moving WORKERS, we see Hitchcock's photo on a cover and his "advice" to theater owners. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (V.O.) My first instruction to Theater Owners: Hire Pinkerton guards to strictly enforce our unique admission policies. 
INT. NEW YORK THEATRE - FLASH FORWARD 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK Ready for the gallows? 
INT. NEW YORK THEATRE, LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER 
The atmosphere is tense as people hurry to their seats. Lew greets them. 
LEW WASSERMAN We've roped off some seats for you. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK You go on ahead. 
ALMA Are you sure? 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK I'll join you in a minute. 
Off Alma's look. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) I want to double check the print. 
ALMA Fine, darling. I'll save you a seat. 
Lew escorts Alma and Peggy into the auditorium. 
INT. NEW YORK THEATER, PROJECTION BOOTH - NIGHT 
The soothing whir of the projector as Hitchcock stands next to it... but the sound of the audience below TITTERING NERVOUSLY is anything but reassuring. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (under his breath) But they're laughing too much. 
He peers down through the tiny window but can't see a bloody thing. INT. NEW YORK THEATRE, DOWNSTAIRS LOBBY - A MINUTE LATER 
Hitch inches open the door and PEERS THROUGH THE CRACK at the audience but now he can't read them. Are they gripped with suspense -- or do they just hate it? 
From the lobby we see 
HITCH 
as he closes the door and leans back against the wall of the empty corridor. A scared, lonely, corpulent figure. Totally powerless. 
There's nothing for him to do but wait. 
And wait. 
And wait. 
Across the foyer, a spotty young THEATRE EMPLOYEE sweeps up ticket stubs and empties ashtrays, quietly going about his business, entirely oblivious... 
ON HITCH'S FACE 
As he grips the railing. This is taking far too long. 
And then -- finally -- the sweetest sound in the world A BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAM. 
Soon the WHOLE AUDIENCE SCREAMS IN TERROR... then breaks into LAUGHTER again... nervous laughter this time, the best kind. 
HITCH 
As he gestures with his hands, a conductor leading his orchestra, raising them up again as the audience STARTS SCREAMING AGAIN right on cue 
PUSHING TIGHTER ON HITCH 
As the dam breaks and all the pent-up emotion floods out... leaving only relief and satisfaction... and making way for a smile... the largest of his whole career. 
INT. NEW YORK THEATRE - LATER 
Hitch, Alma and Peggy are led out into the foyer by the theatre manager. There are still SCREAMS in the theatre as the show continues. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
Lew can be seen on the phone in the theatre manager's office in the background as Hitch, Alma and Peggy walk past the line of ticket buyers to get to the front doors. There is great excitement now as more and more people recognize the Hitchcocks... 
WOMAN WAITING ON LINE Mr. Hitchcock, how does it end? 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK I promised Mother I wouldn't tell. 
He gets a laugh. Hitchcock walks alongside the Theater Manager who's not going to miss out on having his own moment with the crowd. 
THEATER MANAGER Mr. Hitchcock, what do I do now that my wife won't take a shower after seeing your movie? 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK Have her dry-cleaned. 
Laughter as Lew appears. 
LEW WASSERMAN I just got off the phone with Balaban. I couldn't resist telling him we're sold out for the next two weeks. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK What did he say?

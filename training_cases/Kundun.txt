The Himalayas. 
A still photograph, a portrait, of a mountain;  the north face of Chomolungma - a peak also known as Mount Everest - twenty-nine thousand feet high. 
We hear a very young boy speak. 
BOY (VO) Mama, my story. 
A woman speaks: 
WOMAN (VO) Again? 
BOY (VO) Tell me. 
Portrait of a mountain - Khangbochen - craggy peaks covered with snow, twenty-four thousand feet high. 
WOMAN (VO) Your father had been very ill, We thought he would die, and some animals had died. 
BOY (VO) Cow. 
Portrait of a mountain - Shishapangma - twenty-six thousand feet high. 
WOMAN (VO) And a yak.  And chickens.  And we had four years of bad crops, all the farmers did. 
Portrait of a mountain - Anye Machin II - twenty thousand feet high and slightly obscured by clouds. 
WOMAN (VO) In the night, I knew you were coming. 
Now, the foothills.  The still photograph of this barren mountain range comes to life as we see something moving. 
It is a small caravan - traveling this narrow mountain pass. 
WOMAN (VO) At dawn, you were born. 
CLOSER on this caravan.  We can make out eight or ten men, walking, and on horseback, dressed in heavy, brocade coats, and large woolen hats, black braids trailing down their backs.  A yellow palanquin is carried by four large monks, wearing maroon robes. 
The caravan reaches the top of the mountain pass and turns - a sudden shift in direction - a switchback.  The travelers head downhill. 
BOY (VO) Tell me. 
Now, we see the mens's destination.  A lake.  An incredibly blue, circular lake, sunk between snow-dusted mountains.  It is LHAMO I' LATSO - "the Oracle Lake" - and it shimmers in the sunlight. 
As the lake comes into view, a young man pushes back the curtain of the yellow palanquin and peers down at it. 
The man is dressed in royal robes.  He is young, twenty four years old.  His name is RETING RINPOCHE.  He is the Regent of Tibet. 
The color of the lake changes - from brilliant turquoise, to a deep, murky, unfathomable darkness. 
WOMAN (VO) You were a beautiful baby. So calm. 
BOY (VO) No cried? 
The woman laughs. 
WOMAN (VO) Maybe, just a little. 
The palanquin is set down on a flat rock overlooking the lake.  The water's color changes again, to a deep purple, then blue again, then red, then indigo. 
WOMAN (VO) And that day, your father got better.  He named you Lhamo. "The Protector." 
BOY (VO) I know. 
Silence. 
The noblemen and monks surround Reting as he steps out of the palanquin. 
One man stands out here, a monk, a high lama in fact, with a kind face and fantastic, mesmerizing eyes.  He is the LAMA OF SERA. 
WOMAN (VO) Go to sleep, Lhamo. 
Reting stares at the lake. 
The water turns a light grey, and an image appears - obscure at first, then becoming more solid.  A vision. 
He sees a house - a small, stone, one-story, u-shaped house. 
MAN (OC) Good day. 
MOTHER (OC) Please, come in, so cold. 
MAN (OC) We are traveling to Lhasa.  May we...? 
MOTHER (OC) Of course, please, this way. Your servant may use the kitchen. 
MAN (OC) Thank you. 
A middle-aged man, the SERVANT, wearing heavy, ragged clothes and wrapped boots, enters the kitchen. 
Lhamo slides over so that the man can sit on the platform beside him.  The man picks up a few pebbles and drops them - he knows the game. 
We recognize this servant.  His name is KEUSTANG RINPOCHE. He is one of the monks we saw at the Oracle lake, the one with the mesmerizing eyes.  Keustang Rinpoche is the Lama of Sera Monastery. 
Lhamo sees a dark brown rosary around the Servant's neck and immediately pulls at the string of beads. 
LHAMO Mine. 
The Servant takes the rosary off and gives it to the boy. Lhamo hangs the string of beads around his own neck.  The Servant makes a move to take back the rosary, but Lhamo resists. 
LHAMO Mine. 
SERVANT Mine. 
LHAMO Please. 
SERVANT I will give it to, if you can tell me who I am. 
Lhamo looks up, into the man's piercing, black eyes. 
LHAMO The Lama of Sera. You come. 
The Mother enters and immediately sees the rosary around her son's neck.  She gives it back to the Servant. 
MOTHER Lhamo, no. 
Lhamo goes back to his game.  The Mother hands the tired man a slice of bread and a steaming cup of tea.  The man's hands are shaking.  He cannot look the woman in the eye. 
SERVANT Thank you. 
EXT.  COURTYARD  DAWN 
The travelers make their departure at dawn. 
As the party reaches the gate, Lhamo runs from the house, crying: 
LHAMO Wait!  No! 
The men stop.  Lhamo runs to the Servant. 
LHAMO Me, too.  Me go, too. Lhasa! 
Lhamo is in tears. 
MOTHER No, no, no.  Lhasa! He always says he will travel far away.  He always wants to go. 
SERVANT We cannot, young master. 
LHAMO You come back? 
A pause. 
SERVANT We will. 
The travelers head down the road. 
Mother and child return to their home, the Mother carrying the boy on her hip as he swings himself around to take a last look at the strangers. 
EXT.  COURTYARD  DAWN 
The Father readies a pack train of horses.  Lobsang and Lhamo pull on the cinche straps. 
EXT.  FARMLAND  DAY 
The Mother plows with a heavy yoke attached to a large yak. Lobsang Samten and Tsering Dolma help their mother.  Lhamo sleeps under an umbrella. 
EXT.  COURTYARD  DAY 
Lobsang and Lhamo running, carrying a bowl of eggs. 
INT.  KITCHEN  NIGHT 
Lobsang is wrapped in maroon wool, trying to hold still as his Mother pins and stitches.  Lhamo sits, sipping tea, watching, woefully. 
MOTHER Say, Kumbum Monastery. 
KEUSTANG RINPOCHE With permission? 
The Lama carefully pulls back the boy's overalls.  There is a little birthmark, like a conch shell, on his shoulder. 
Keustang Rinpoche pulls up the boy's pants legs.  There is a funny skin marking on the legs, like tiger stripes. 
The Lama rearranges the boy's clothing, then one more time, takes the beautiful, little hands in his own and whispers: 
KEUSTANG RINPOCHE "Kundun" 
He says to the others, in a soft, secretive voice: 
KEUSTANG RINPOCHE He is the Presence. 
In the background, by an open curtain, we see Lhamo's Mother. 
She says, softly: 
MOTHER My oldest boy is an incarnation. 
KEUSTANG RINPOCHE So is your youngest. 
Keustang releases the boy's hands and brings his own closed palms up to his forehead. 
KEUSTANG RINPOCHE I wish you long life. 
The Mother begins to cry. 
INT.  ALTAR ROOM  DAY 
Little Lhamo, now dressed in yellow, fills the copper water bowls with difficulty. 
His parents stand beside him.  They share one, frightened curious look. 
CLOSE on the statue of Buddha.  It is an image of Chenrezig, the Buddha of Compassion.  He has eleven heads and four, outstretched arms. 
EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE  DAY 
Lhamo sits in the saddle in front of his Mother.  His Father and Sister ride beside them, through an incredible, empty, Tibetan landscape.  A Monk rides lead. 
EXT.  EST. SHOT / KUMBUM MONASTERY  DAY 
Turquoise-roof, golden-pagoda, a beautiful, white-washed monastery built against a terraced, green hillside of Amdo. 
INT.  PRIVATE ROOM, MONASTERY  DAY 
Mother pats her son Lhamo's unruly hair and makes a soft, comforting sound.  Lobsang is there beside his brother. Lobsang is already dressed as a tiny monk - in a maroon robe, with short, clipped hair  An older brother, TAKSTER, age 17, a lama, is there. 
The Mother lies: 
MOTHER I will be back in a few days. 
LHAMO How many? 
MOTHER Two. 
Lhamo holds up two fingers. 
LHAMO This many? 
MOTHER Yes, yes.  Your brothers are here. 
Takster moves closer.  She places the sad youngster in Takster's arms. 
MOTHER One more kiss. 
Lhamo kisses her, as does Lobsang and even Takster falls into her arms for a moment.  Then, she turns and goes, quickly. 
A Monk appears.  He produces a concertina and begins to play for the little boy. 
But, Lhamo begins to cry, through the music, through the hugs of his brothers.  As a result of Lhamo's tears, Lobsang begins to cry.  Takster holds them both.  The music continues. The older, wiser, Takster begins to cry, too. The three brothers hold one another.  Three brothers, three monks, crying for their mother.  The music continues, echoing in this stone monastery. 
The young "Kundun" is gently rocked by his older brother. 
He begins to fall asleep. 
DREAM SEQUENCE 
The sound of the concertina becomes chanting and we see row after row of monks, in a temple, their voices mingling in the empty room. 
View of a courtyard, with young novices, reciting.  Lobsang is among them. 
BOYS'S VOICES (VO) "May I be the doctor and the medicine, And may I be the nurse, For all sick beings in the world, until everyone is healed." 
A TEACHER, a very stern-looking monk, carrying a thick, flat board, menacingly, behind his back, walks among the students. 
A golden head of a Buddha - a huge head - appears to be bursting through an archway at the end of a dark hallway. 
Vendors hawk their goods to elegant ladies, wearing turquoise jewelry and carrying silken parasols.  Animals are herded through town by young boys.  Children play and squabble.  A white wall is covered with cartoons, lampoons - political posters - picturing the Regent, perhaps, as a man holding too much power. 
TENZIN GYATSO I want to go down there. 
NORBU THUNDRUP You can only go with attendants and a big ceremony. 
TENZIN GYATSO I want to run down the street. I want to buy a toy.  Eat from the shops. 
NORBU THUNDRUP You cannot. 
TENZIN GYATSO I want to be a shepherd, taking those goats and cows out to the hillside. 
NORBU THUNDRUP But you are not a shepherd, you are the Dalai Lama. 
TENZIN GYATSO Maybe in the next life, the world will not need a Dalai Lama. 
NORNU ThUNDRUP I would not know.  Maybe. 
The view travels and we see a prison yard.  Shackled men share the yard with hairy, fat dogs. 
One man looks up and sees that the yard is under surveillance.  Of course the men all know that this terrace belongs to the boy Dalai Lama. 
As the boy watches, first one poor, ragged man, then another prostrates. 
Tenzin Gyatso pulls away from the telescope.  He waves to the prisoners. 
EXT.  VALLEY OUTSIDE LHASA  DAY  (SUMMER, 1942) 
The boy rides in his palanquin of yellow silk. 
He is older now, seven or eight.  He peers through the curtain. 
A grand procession carries the Dalai Lama from the Potala to his summer residence, the Norbulinka. 
Monks walk in procession, as do members of the aristocracy, wearing their finest gowns and jewelry, holding their finest parasols, and soldiers, wearing ancient uniforms.  There are horses, banners and carriages.  Bodyguards carry the Dalai Lama's possessions - wrapped in yellow silk.  A band plays, "God Save the King." 
It is a magnificent display, and along the side of the road, Tibetans prostrate in the presence of the boy, not daring to look at him. 
EXT.  THE NORBULINKA  DAY 
Establishing shot of this lovely park. 
Zt looks like a sweet, summer home compared to the looming expansiveness of the Potala.  It is filled with deer and antelope, peacocks and nesting birds.  An eccentric collection of trees grow here - some indigenous, some gifts - bearing flowers and fruit.  There are fish ponds and even a Kyichu river tributary nearby. 
We find the young Dalai Lama standing by this tributary daring to put one foot on a slippery, stepping stone.  An Attendant gently pulls him back. 
Beyond the river, a herder leads a small group of braying sheep towards town.  The boy watches.  He listens to the herder's song. 
EXT.  GARDENS, NORBULINKA  DAY 
The Dalai Lama drops bits of food into a fish pond.  He calls the huge, lazy fish to come eat. 
TENZIN GYATSO Little ones first, only little ones. 
The boy pushes the bigger ones away with a stick. 
EXT.  YELLOW WALL, NORBULINKA  DAY 
Tenzin Gyatso runs through an open gate in a mustard yellow wall (which separates the Dalai Lama's residence from the rest of the Norbulinka), and up the steps leading to a white, one story, home - his parent's. 
INT.  PARENT'S HOME, NORBULINKA  DAY 
A startling, blue room. 
The young Dalai Lama leans on the table where is Father sits eating pork rinds. 
Lobsang is there, practicing his writing on a chalk board. 
Tenzin Gyatso grabs one pork rind, then another, then a third. 
LOBSANG SAMTEN The Dalai Lama is not supposed to eat pork.  It is not good for your brain. 
The Father uses the grease from the roasted lamb on the table to caress his long mustache and twirl each side into a point. 
The Dalai Lama takes another, and then, suddenly, the boy reaches up and for no reason, he pulls on his Father's mustache, obviously hurting the man.  The Father slaps the boy's hand, hard. 
The boy sits back, and begins drawing imaginary letters on the tabletop with his slapped hand. 
His Father reaches out and takes the hurt hand.  He pulls the boy into his arms. 
FATHER I am sorry, Lhamo. 
TENZIN GYATSO It is alright, Father. 
The Master of the Robe knocks at the door.  Father and son look up. 
MASTER OF THE ROBE Kundun, you must come back now. 
TENZIN GYATSO But you will always be here? 
MOTHER Me? 
TENZIN GYATSO You will always! 
MOTHER I have one more piece of news.  A baby is coming. 
Tenzin grabs at her stomach and shrieks with laughter. 
TENZIN GYATSO Oh, Mama!  Who will it be? 
The Mother places her hands on Tenzin Gyatso's. 
MOTHER Oh, no!  Who can it be? 
A string of old monks, stand, waiting for the naughty boy. 
INT.  ENTRANCE HALL, DALAI LAMA'S RESIDENCE, NORBULINKA, DAY 
The boy runs up the stairs and towards the old men, but he stops and looks at a small cabinet standing, unobtrusively, in a corner.  Tenzin Gyatso goes to the cabinet and rattles the locked door. 
TENZIN GYATSO My teeth!  My teeth are in here! 
A monk takes the boy by the hand and leads him down a hallway. 
TENZIN GYATSO My old teeth! 
INT.  DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS, EVENING 
A bell and a dorge are laid out on a small table.  Tenzin Gyatso sits in front of this table. 
A monk is chanting in low, deep tones, in the background. 
The Dalai Lama's teacher, TAKTRA RINPOCHE, sits on the floor.  (Being the teacher, Taktra Rinpoche sits slightly higher than the Dalai Lama.)  Taktra is an older man, in his sixties.  He is stern, solid, no-nonsense. 
Taktra Rinpoche begins a prayer. 
TAKTRA RINPOCHE "I take refuge in the three jewels, The Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangra." 
But the boy leaps up from his table and goes to Taktra and hangs around his neck, shouting: 
TENZIN GYATSO You recite! You recite! 
Taktra gives the boy just the slightest of looks. 
TAKTRA RINPOCHE "I take refuge in the three jewels, The Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangra." 
Tenzin Gyatso releases the Lama and goes back to his own table. 
TAKTRA RINPOCHE "Until I attain enlightenment." 
Taktra Rinpoche has a small table with the same hand instruments in front of him.  The teacher lifts the dorge, in a particular fashion, and rotates it. 
Tenzin Gyatso lifts his dorge.  Taktra's hands move to the boy's and show him the correct movement.  It is tried again. Now, the bell is lifted and rung. 
TENZIN GYATSO I would like you to be my new Regent. 
Taktra stops.  He nods to the boy. 
As the chanting continues, Taktra Rinpoche begins a weaving motion with his hands, delicate, beautiful, hypnotic. 
Tenzin Gyatso copies the elder. 
We are CLOSE on the boy's moving hands. The chanting becomes the voices of a hundred men, as we FADE OUT. 
FADE IN:  on the boy's hands, but they are a little larger - they are the hands of an eleven or twelve year-old boy - and the motion they carry out is on the verge of becoming extraordinarily beautiful. 
INT.  DARK ROOM, POTALA  EVENING (1944) 
Tenzin Gyatso sits alone, in a small, dark green, room.  He is older.  His robes have changed slightly, his manner is more refined, more dignified. 
He is on a retreat. 
There is a soft knock at the door.  The door is opened and food is placed inside the small room by bodiless hands. Tenzin Gyatso collects his food.  He sips his tea and eats his tsampa, while reading from a long, narrow stack of scriptures.  Thangkas of MILERAPA - the great Tibetan poet and teacher - hang on the walls. 
We notice the curly-toed shoes of the Master of the Kitchen, just visible beneath the wooden door. 
EXT.  COURTYARD, THE POTALA  NIGHT 
The boy walks alone, moving to the rhythm of a memorization. His breath consolidates in the cold night air.  The sky is brilliant with stars. 
TENZIN GYATSO (reciting) "As long as any living thing draws breath, wherever he shall be, there, in compassion, shall the Buddha appear, incarnate." 
INT.  DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS, THE POTALA  DAY 
School is in session. 
The view of the floor reveals that a "toy" war is being waged. 
With a "Meccano" set, the young Dalai Lama has created what looks like an airplane, and a tank.  These vehicles are manned by beautifully detailed lead soldiers - British World War One Field soldiers, French Legionaries and American Artillery men. 
Norbu Thundrup, is flying low with a tsampa~dough airplane. He drops little tsampa-dough bombs from his hand.  He hits a tank and knocks down a few lead soldiers. 
TENZIN GYATSO Oh, nicely done, Norbu.  I will get you. 
The Lord Chamberlain enters. 
LORD CHAMBERLAIN May I listen to the news with you, Holiness? 
TENZIN GYATSO Please. 
A large, old-fashioned, short-wave radio broadcasts that there is still a real war in progress.  The BBC report is of the Pacific front. 
TENZIN GYATSO How big is Tibet's army? 
LORD CPIAMBERLAIN Roughly five thousand men. 
TENZIN GYATSO Is that big? 
LORD CHAMBERLAIN No.  Not very big. 
TENZIN GYATSO The Regent is adding men. And he bought rifles and ammunition from India. Mountain guns, too. 
The broadcast reports news of the civil war in China. 
TENZIN GYATSO Will we be in this war? 
LORD CHAMBERLAIN No.  This war is almost over. 
TENZIN GYATSO Will we ever be in war? 
The Lord Chamberlain is silent.  Norbu answers. 
NORBU THUNDRUP We have enemies. 
TENZIN GYATSO The Chinese. 
NORBU THUNDRUP Yes. 
TENZIN GYATSO But, surely, we are safe in Tibet. We don't believe in killing. 
LORD CHAMBERLAIN No, we don't. 
Tenzin Gyatso gets to his feet and takes an atlas from his table.   He lays the book open on the floor. 
TENZIN GYATSO This is Britain. 
NORBU THUNDRUP Ahh. 
TENZIN GYATSO Where is Poland? 
The Lord chamberlain sits on the floor.  He points to Poland. 
TENZIN GYATSO Where is Pearl Harbor? 
The Master of the Kitchen comes to look at the atlas. 
LORD CHAMBERLAIN In the Pacific Ocean.  It is an island.  American territory. 
TENZIN GYATSO Where is Alsace? 
LORD CHAMBERLAIN I do not know, Holiness. 
Tenzin Gyatso turns to a well thumbed page:  Tibet. 
TENZIN GYATSO This is Tibet. And this is China. 
NORBU THUNDRUP Ahh. 
They all look at huge China. 
TENZIN GYATSO Certainly, we are safe in Tibet. 
No one answers. 
Finally, as Norbu Thundrup begins to gather up the tsampa- dough: 
NORBU THUNDRUP We hope, Kundun. 
Tenzin Gyatso turns to the Lord Chamberlain. 
TENZIN GYATSO What was the warning of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama? 
LORD CHAMBERLAIN He warned about the future of Tibet. 
EXT.  DALAI LAMA'S TERRACE  DAY 
Tenzin Gyatso climbs up on a small, wooden platform, and mans his telescope. 
TENZIN GYATSO It's the army, firing on Sera Monastery! Oh, no!  Oh, no! 
The shooting continues. 
TENZIN GYATSO Why is this?  What is happening? Tell me! 
NORBU THUNDRUP Reting Rinpoche has been arrested.  He tried to overthrow Regent Taktra. Today, he is brought back to Lhasa by government officials. The monks at Sera Monastery have been on his side.  Now, there is trouble between them and the army. 
The Lord Chamberlain arrives on the terrace. 
LORD CHAMBERLAIN I am sorry for you to have to witness this, Kundun. 
TENZIN GYATSO Look here! 
The Lord Chamberlain peers through the telescope as the shooting continues. 
LORD CHAMBERLAIN Tragic.  Unnecessary. 
The Lord Chamberlain steps away from the telescope and the boy takes his place. 
The shooting slowly stops. 
LORD CHAMBERLAIN Holiness? I have a letter. 
The boy looks up. 
LORD CHAMBERLAIN The Thirteenth Dalai Lama's warning. He wrote to you, the year before he died.  The year before you were born. 
The Lord Chamberlain walks to a far, sheltered end of the terrace. 
Tenzin Gyatso slowly turns the telescope to see the prison yard. 
View through the telescope;  the yard is full of prisoners, listening to the shooting.  One man sees the telescope aimed at the prison and prostrates.  Then another, and another. 
Tenzin Gyatso steps away from the telescope and turns to follow his Lord Chamberlain. 
EXT.  OTHER SIDE OF TERRACE  DAY 
The Lord Chamberlain opens a yellowing letter and begins to read.  Tenzin Gyatso sits down beside him. 
LORD CHAMBERLAIN "It may happen, that here in Tibet, religion and government will be attacked both from without and within. Unless we guard our own country..." 
CLOSE on the Lord Chamberlain.  Today, he appears tired; the whites of his eyes appear enormous.  His voice is quite beautiful. 
LORD CHAMBERLAIN "...it will now happen that the Dalai and Panchen Lamas, the Father and the Son, and all the revered holders of the faith, will disappear and become nameless." 
Tenzin Gyatso unwinds the rosary from his wrist and begins thumbing the brown beads. 
LORD CHAMBERLAIN "Monks and their monasteries will be destroyed. The rule of law will be weakened. The lands and properties will be seized.  They themselves will be forced to serve their enemies or wander the country like beggars." 
"All beings will be sunk in great hardship and overwhelming fear; the days and nights will drag on slowly in suffering." 
He is finished. 
TENZIN GYATSO What can I do?  I am only a boy. 
LORD CHAMBERLAIN You are the man who wrote this letter.  You are the man who has come back to lead us.   You will soon have great responsibilities.  You must know what to do. 
INT.  DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS, ADJACENT ROOM,  DAY 
The Regent and the Lord Chamberlain are present. 
Also present is the KASHAG - a council of four men:  one monk, three laymen.  They are the Dalai Lama's advisory cabinet. 
INT.  DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOM  DAY 
The boy rises from his desk.  Norbu says: 
NORBU THUNDRUP You remember who you are. You called for them. 
Tenzin Gyatso enters the adjacent room. 
INT.  ADJACENT ROOM  DAY 
The boy climbs onto a cushion and sits - a head above his officials.  He is tentative, unsure of form and procedure. 
There is an awkward, formal silence.  Then: 
TENZIN GYATSO Taktra Rinpoche, I understand there was an attempt on your life. 
TAKTRA RINPOCHE It is possible, Holiness. 
TENZIN GYATSO You are unharmed? 
EXT.  NORBULINKA  DAY 
The young Tenzin Gyatso bursts through the gate in the Yellow Wall and runs across the beautiful garden to his parents's home. 
INT.  PARENTS'S HOME, NORBULINKA  DAY 
A family gathering meets the boy's eye when he enters. 
There is his Mother, his oldest sister, Tsering Dolma, Lobsang Samten, a younger sister, Pema, baby brother Tendzin Chuta, and his oldest brother, Takster. 
We don't recognize these faces, of course, but the gathering is obviously familial. 
Only the boy's Father is missing. 
Tenzin Gyatso goes to his Mother and lays his head in her lap. 
On an altar behind her, is a silver frame.  In the frame is a picture of her husband. 
DREAM SEQUENCE 
EXT.  HILLTOP  DAWN 
The body of the Dalai Lama's Father lays on a flat boulder. 
Incense smoke curls into the air.  Prayer wheels are turned, hand drums are played - the burial men stand off to one side, their hatchets and knives in view. 
Tenzin Gyatso is present.  He is the boy we know, but beside him stands the four year-old boy, Lhamo, from the beginning of the movie, and on the other side of him stands the boy who will play the Dalai Lama in the next section of the film -  a boy about fifteen or sixteen. 
Tenzin Gyatso wraps his brown rosary around his left wrist. The beads catch the brilliant afternoon light.  The sixteen year-old Dalai Lama wears the same colored rosary around his left wrist. 
The cutters move in to the corpse, and as we hear them begin the work of dismembering the body, the view pans up to reveal the vultures circling overhead. 
The last person leaving the hilltop with is the Dalai Lama as an older man - not a character from this movie - but a man of about fifty years, wearing glasses, wearing the same robes, the same rosary.  Little Lhamo walks beside him. 
END DREAM SEQUENCE 
EXT.  SKY OVER TIBET  NIGHT 
We hear a loud explosion, and then another and another and another.  The sound begins to fade, but the blue-black, peaceful, star-filled sky is shattered by bright bursts of red and yellow and pink light. 
It is a frightening sight. 
EXT.  GARDEN, NORBULINKA  DAWN (1950) 
The still waters of the fish pond begin to move.  The fish swim in nervous circles;  the water laps over its stone banks. 
EXT.  DALAI LAMA'S RESIDENCE  DAWN 
The whole building shakes.  Earthquake. 
One monk runs down the stairs, another monk runs up, both staring at a second floor window - a black-rimmed, glass window. 
A red cloth is pulled back and the window is opened. 
The fifteen year-old Tenzin Gyatso looks out. 
There is a terrible rumbling:  the rumbling that accompanies an earthquake.  Finally, slowly, the sound, and the movement subsides. 
CLOSE on Tenzin Gyatso.  He lets the curtain fall. 
INT.  GREAT HALL, THE POTALA  DAY 
The General Assembly is in session. 
Once again, the Yigstang and the Tsitang - four monks and four laymen - sit facing one another.  But the room is crowded today - this is a full session.  The Lord chamberlain sits in.  Regent Taktra is there. 
The senior Layman is on his knees. 
LAYMAN The Communist have control of China. 
In the back of the room we notice an open door. 
INT.  HALLWAY  DAY 
The Dalai Lama is listening.  He stands taller than the first time we caught him eavesdropping.  He still is not a part of this assembly, but he doesn't seem to care if he is spotted. 
INT.  GREAT HALL  DAY 
The Layman continues. 
LAYMAN Now, as his great army, stands idle on our borders, Chairman Mao has presented Tibet with three demands: 
One, Tibet must accept that it is part of China. 
A murmuring in the room. 
INT.  HALLWAY  DAY 
Atop a low building on the Yellow Wall, stands an elaborate enclosure - draped in yellow silk. 
The Dalai Lama sits inside it. 
INT.  ENCLOSURE  DAY 
Tenzin Gyatso is alone in this little room;  his arms rest on a window ledge as he stares down at the festival taking place below him. 
EXT.  GARDENS  DAY 
A bit more of the dancers and the people enjoying themselves - all from the isolated point of view of the Dalai Lama. 
We recognize a few characters:  Keustang Rinpoche.  His Holiness's Mother with her younger children, the favorite sweeper, Norbu Thundrup - dressed in a fine hat. 
But a distant figure becomes apparent - he is a MESSENGER - he is running, through the crowds, toward the Yellow Wall. 
We stay on this desperate little figure as he draws closer. 
INT.  ENCLOSURE  DAY 
The boy is watching the Messenger. 
EXT.  GARDENS  DAY 
Back to that messenger as he works his way, ever closer to the building which holds the Dalai Lama aloft, and then we lose sight of him. 
INT.  ENCLOSURE  DAY 
Tenzin Gyatso leans back in his seat.  The yellow silk curtain that his elbows have held open now fall closed and we hear the heavy footsteps of the runner. 
A knock. 
TAKTRA RINPOCHE (OC) Enter. 
The Regent is next door. 
The boy climbs up on a chest and peeks through a tiny window in the wall which separates this enclosure from the Regent's. 
Taktra Rinpoche reads a telegram.  His aging face becomes quite grave. 
The Regent leaves his side of the enclosure. 
REGENT (OC) Summon the Lord Chamberlain and the Kashag. 
And then, there is a knock on the Dalai Lama's door. 
TENZIN GYATSO Enter. 
It is the Regent. 
REGENT TAKTRA Holiness. 
TENZIN GYATSO Yes. 
REGENT TAKTRA The Chinese have invaded. 
EXT.  GARDENS, NORBULINKA  DAY 
Back to a new group of performers - satirists, dressed as high lamas and monks - even as the Nechung Oracle - lampooning the rulers.  The crowd roars with laughter. 
INT.  DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS, NORBULINKA  DUSK 
The Lord Chamberlain stands with the teenage Dalai Lama. The room is a violent red in the sunset. 
Tenzin Gyatso has cleared off his table, he is creating a three-dimensional battlefield as his Lord Chamberlain explains the situation.  Tenzin Gyatso uses papers, books, little statues to bring a physical life to the words we hear. 
LORD CHAMBERLAIN They crossed the river, Holiness. They have invaded in six locations, Chando Province, Kham, eastern Tibet. 
TENZIN GYATSO What is the size of our army, now? 
LORD CHAMBERLAIN Eight thousand, five hundred, soldiers and officers. We have recently requested mortars, anti-aircraft guns and ammunition from India.  We have several hundred in the area. 
Little statues are placed facing what stands-in for the river. 
The Lord Chamberlain helps the boy to create this panorama. 
TENZIN GYATSO Has anyone died? 
LORD CHMBERLAIN The radio contact said one officer had died.  Then he said, "The Chinese soldiers - they are coming." And then, the radio went dead. 
Tenzin Gyatso lifts one statue, a small, golden Buddha, from the display.  He cradles the Buddha in his hands. 
TENZIN GYATSO One man.  A man has died. One man is too many. 
INT.  DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS, NORBULINKA  DAY 
In beautiful sunlight, the painted cabinets of this room glisten.  Rainbows of color play on the glass windows.  The Dalai Lama sits at a low table, a pack of colored pencils, or pastels, spread out around him.  He is teaching his little brother to draw. 
A monk - an abbot, in fact - sits beside Tenzin Gyatso. 
It is Takster Rinpoche, the Dalai Lama's oldest brother. 
TAKSTER RINPOCHE I was never alone.  Two Chinese were with me every minute of the day. 
Tenzin Gyatso plays with a box of those special sweets which comes from his mother. 
TAKSTER RINPOCHE Their talk is always of liberation and helpfulness.  They put their words like honey on a knife, but if you lick the honey, you will bleed. 
Takster Rinpoche begins to say something, but holds back. 
TENZIN GYATSO Tell me. 
TAKSTER RINPOCHE They think they have convinced me. They think I am on their side. They have allowed me to leave Kumbum and come to Lhasa believing that I will try to turn you to their ways. If I do not succeed, I am to eliminate you. 
TENZIN GYATSO You, kill me? 
TAKSTER RINPOCHE Eliminate you. 
The tension is great, the idea profound. 
TARSTER RINPOCHE I can be Governor of Lhasa, they say. 
The brothers try to resist, but cannot.  They laugh like crazy. 
TAKSTER RINPOCHE Don't eat all those sweets. You'll get sick. 
TENZIN GYATSO Do you remember the day I came to your monastery, when I was a baby? And you comforted me? 
TAKSTER RINPOCHE I do. 
TENZIN GYATSO I remember, too, actually. I was frightened then. I am frightened now. 
TAKSTER RINPOCHE The Chinese have one goal.  The complete dissolution of our nation. The destruction of our culture. There is no room for Buddha in their world. 
Our only hope is to fight. 
TENZIN GYATSO We cannot. 
TAKSTER RINPOCHE This is not a fight to put bread just in one's own mouth. This is a fight for Tibet. 
TENZIN GYATSO Buddha teaches that we must learn from our enemy.  We have compassion for all people. 
TAKSTER RINPOCHE These are not human beings. They are worse than ghosts. 
Silence. 
TAKSTER RINPOCHE You are in great danger. The Dalai Lama cannot fall into Chinese hands. You must flee. 
TENZIN GYATSO How could I ever leave? 
TAKSTER RINPOCHE It may not be your decision to make. 
INT.  DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS, THE POTALA  DAY 
In the adjacent room, the four members of the Kashag and the Lord Chamberlain are waiting. 
The Dalai Lama enters the room. 
The boy goes to a small table where a document is unrolled before him. 
Tenzin Gyatso lifts the gold seal of power and affixes it to the document. 
TENZIN GYATSO I accept it. 
He makes his mark on a small piece of parchment that is attached to the document. 
He has accepted the request to be enthroned. 
INT.  DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS  HOUR BEFORE DAWN 
The Master of the Robe is helping Tenzin Gyatso to dress. He ties a piece of green cloth around his waist and helps him on with his maroon robes. 
Norbu is there, watching. 
INT.  HALLS OF THE POTALA  PRE-DAWN 
Tenzin Gyatso walks down this dark hall.  The three attendants are with him. 
INT.  TEMPLE  DAWN 
It is very dark green.  Butter lamps highlight certain faces - members of the Kashag, noblemen, the tutors, an Englishman, Nepalese, Bhutanese, Tibetan Muslims - but the darkness conceals the great number of people present. 
We hear the unmistakable Tibetan horns and cymbals. We hear the chanting of monks. 
The boy is handed a Golden Wheel, symbolizing the assumption of temporal power. 
The small group walks down a rocky path.  A grey horse is waiting. 
Tenzin Gyatso is helped onto the horse.  Norbu sees that he is comfortable, and then, the flashlight goes out.  Norbu fiddles with it.  Tenzin Gyatso takes the torch and tries get it working again.  The Guard mounts his horse.  It is time to go.  The horses snort, their breath consolidating the cold night air. 
Tenzin Gyatso cannot speak.  He tries, but he cannot.  Norbu takes the flashlight. 
NORBU THUNDRUP I will send it to you. It will work. 
The horse is turned and the Dalai Lama is led away to join the soldiers at the foot of the path. 
Tenzin Gyatso turns once, to see his friend.  The night is dark.  Norbu has become invisible. 
EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE  NIGHT 
A cold and moonless night, lit only by the millions of stars that shine over Tibet.  The caravan - made up of noblemen, monks, family mambers and over two hundred soldiers (armed with rifles, machine guns and field artillery) - journeys out of Lhasa. 
CLOSE on the Dalai Lama:  riding the shepherd's path. 
EXT.  YELLOW WALL, NORBULINKA  NIGHT 
Tenzin Gyatso rides his grey horse through a gate in the yellow wall. 
EXT.  DALAI LAMA'S RESIDENCE  NIGHT 
The boy climbs the stairs to his summer residence. 
INT.  ALTAR ROOM  NIGHT 
The shrine of Mahakala.  Butter lamps cast their eerie glow on the black walls as the boy presents a white, silk scarf, a kata - a traditional token of leaving and return. 
INT  ENTRANCE WAY, NORBULINKA  NIGHT 
Tenzin Gyatso is about to leave the residence when he stops, and looks at the small cabinet in the corner.  He goes to it. 
The door is still locked. 
CLOSE on the boy.  Suddenly, he knows. 
He reaches a hand behind the cabinet.  The hand comes back to him with a key. 
Tenzin Gyatso opens the cabinet doors.  Several drawers are revealed. 
The boy opens one.  Empty.  Another.  Empty. 
A Bodyguard says, from the stairs: 
BODYGUARD We must go, Holiness. 
TENZIN GYATSO A moment. 
Another drawer.  Empty.  And then, success. 
In a small drawer, there is something, wrapped in red velvet. 
The boy opens it, with shaking hands.  Teeth.  False teeth. 
Tenzin Gyatso releases a sharp laugh, he has been holding his breath.   He wraps up the teeth and puts them back, but behind the teeth is something more. 
A rolled, white silk scarf, a kata. 
Tenzin Gyatso takes the scarf.  He unrolls it.  Something falls on the floor. 
A tiny, lead soldier. 
Tenzin Gyatso lifts the soldier.  It is a Ghurka.  An Indian soldier. 
BODYGUARD Please, come, Holiness. 
TENZIN GYATSO Yes.  I am ready. 
The boy places the scarf around his own shoulders. 
TENZIN GYATSO Safe journey.  Safe return. 
I am him. 
CLOSE on the golden statue of Mahakala, wearing his white scarf. 
We hear the roar of the Kyichu river. 
EXT.  KYICHU RIVER  NIGHT 
Coracles - skin boats - are loaded with bundles and people and pushed off the banks and into the water. 
Horses, donkeys and yaks must swim across. 
Tenzin Gyatso is helped into a boat.  The rowers, wrapped in heavy wool and sheepskin, their arms bare, push off. 
MUSLIM MAN No, no son of mine will sit and read books and eat up the poor people's butter while my people have to butcher the cows and sheep because these holy men can't kill an animal.  They can eat it, can't they? 
The boy laughs again. 
EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE - LATER  DAY 
Still walking, with two companions.  A Tibetan peasant WOMAN, and his own mother. 
TENZIN GYATSO Did you love your husband, before you married? 
TIBETAN WOMAN I did not know him before I married him.  I loved his brother, but then, I married his brother, too.  He is dead now. 
TENZIN GYATSO Hmm. 
TIBETAN WOMAN The land has stayed in the family. We work together.  The nobleman is not too bad. 
TENZIN GYATSO Does he treat you fairly? 
A laugh from her. 
TIBETAN WOMAN Not too bad.  Rich is rich, poor is poor.  We are different. Are you married? 
Tenzin Gyatso laughs. 
The Attendants walk behind the boy, eavesdropping.  Tenzin Gyatso's Mother plays along. 
TENZIN GYATSO No. 
TIBETAN WOMAN Too young? 
TENZIN GYATSO Much too young. 
TIBETAN WOMAN Look for a strong woman, not too occupied with her beauty. Look for a woinan who keeps her hands busy.  Look for a kind heart. 
TENZIN GYATSO Like my mother. 
TIBETAN WOMAN I see that. 
EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE, STILL LATER  DAY 
The Dalai Lama walks beside two boys: his older brother, Lobsang, and a YOUNG NOBLE BOY. 
TENZIN GYATSO This little brother was terribly sweet.  When he died, my mother was so sad.  A lama said to her, before the little brother was laid out for burial, take a bit of butter and rub a spot on his skin.  He will come back to you, you will see. So, my mother did this, and a few years later, a new boy was born. 
NOBLE BOY Does he have the spot? 
TENZIN GYATSO He does, a little spot where the butter had been. 
NOBLE BOY Is that a true story, or pretend? 
TENZIN GYATSO What do you think? 
NOBLE BOY True. 
TENZIN GYATSO You decide. 
They walk. 
NOBLE BOY What does the butter spot feel like? 
TENZIN GYATSO Soft.  Nice. I have a good friend back in Lhasa.  He has a very poor beard, with a little spot on his chin where no hair grows.  It feels like that. 
EXT.  EST. SHOT,  DUNGKHAR MONASTERY - ON A HILL, OVERLOOKING DROMO VALLEY  DAY 
It is raining as we see the Dalai Lama on horseback, climbing the dirt path leading to this beautiful, small monastery.  The caravan has arrived at its destination. 
We hear the chanting of monks. 
INT.  THE DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS, DUNGKAAR MONASTERY DAY 
A home has been made:   books on the shelf, screwdrivers all in a row, European shoes under the bed.  An old Bush radio receiver, running off a six-volt battery, sits on the floor. The telescope stands on the terrace. 
Two members of the Kashag can be seen in the adjacent room. The rooms are stark white. 
KASHAG MEMBER Of the Tibetan delegations sent abroad, all have been turned away. 
TENZIN GYATSO (OC) All? 
INT.  ADJACENT ROOM  DAY 
Tenzin Gyatso, dressed informally, looking peaceful, sits with his advisors on the floor.  The Lord Chamberlain is with them. 
KASHAG MEMBER Britain, Nepal, America, India. All of those governments have refused to meet with our representatives. 
Silence. 
TENZIN GYATSO And the United Nations?  Surely? 
Tenzin Gyatso is stunned.  Frozen. 
LORD CHAMBERLAIN (OC) It means we have lost our status as an independent nation. 
INT.  PARLOR, DUNGKHAR MONASTERY  DAY 
Tenzin Gyatso, the two members of the Kashag and the Lord Chamberlain stand around a clicking telegraph machine.  A long message curls along the floor. 
KASHAG MEMBER Ngabo did not have the state seal.  He could not sign. 
TENZIN GYATSO Yes, but they say he did. 
A Kashag Member is reading along as the message comes in. 
KASHAG MEMBER Holiness? 
TENZIN GYATSO Yes. 
KASHAG MEMBER General Chiang Chin-wu, the Chinese representative, is en route to Dromo. He is coming to meet you. 
TENZIN GYATSO Then, we shall meet. 
EXT.  TERRACE, MONASTERY  DAY 
View through the telescope:  the Chinese are coming. 
A group of officials are headed in the direction of the monastery.  Within the group of Tibetan noblemen - dressed in their traditional red and gold silk robes - are three men, wearing drab, grey suits. 
The Chinese men closer and we see that one of them is smoking a cigarette. 
CLOSE on Tenzin Gyatso's face. 
INT.  PARLOR, MONASTERY  DAY 
The Chinese Delegation, led by GENERAL CHIANG CHIN-WU, stands waiting in a dimly-lit, yellow room. 
A table holds tea and refreshments. 
The Dalai Lama and his cabinet members are in the room. Chairs are provided. 
GENERAL CHIANG CHIN-WU Dalai Lama. 
TENZIN GYATSO General Chiang. 
GENERAL CHIANG CHIN-WU We bring greetings from Chairman Mao. 
TENZIN GYATSO Thank you.  Please sit. 
The General does.  So does the Dalai Lama. The other two Chinese remain standing. 
Tenzin Gyatso is quiet, reserved.  Awkward. 
GENERAL CHIANG CHIN-WU Have you heard the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement? 
TENZIN GYATSO I have. 
GENERAL CHIANG CHIN-WU I have a copy for you. 
A document is produced.  We notice that the General is wearing a gold rolex watch.  The Dalai Lama notices, too. A member of the Kashag takes the document. 
GENERAL CHIANG CHIN-WU We come in genuine friendship. 
CLOSE on the Dalai Lama. 
He makes no response. 
GENERAL CHIANG CHIN-WU I am certain you wish to return to Lhasa. 
Tenzin Gyatso remains silent. 
GENERAL CHIANG CHIN-WU Do you have plans to return soon, Dalai Lama? 
TENZIN GYATSO Soon. 
GENERAL CHIANG CHIN-WU Good.  Our first request is that you allow us to build a road.  You have no roads in Tibet.  We can discuss the plans in Lhasa.  When you return. 
No response. 
GENERAL CHIANG-WU Thank you.  We leave now. 
The General rises as the boy remains seated.  With a moment of awkward silence, the Chinese depart. 
TENZIN GYATSO Let me see the agreement. 
It is handed to him.  He opens to the last page and looks at the impression made by the state seal. 
TENZIN GYATSO Counterfeit. 
DREAM SEQUENCE ENDS 
Tenzin Gyatso eyes burst open.  He is awake.  He is older. Twenty.  But, there is something ageless about him, now. 
INT.  DALAI LAMA'S ROOM, THE POTALA  PRE-DAWN 
The boy begins this day. 
He is in his old room at the Potala, in Lhasa.  The green mural of the Fifth Dalai Lama is behind him.  He has risen. from the red-curtained bed. 
The Masters of the Kitchen and the Robe arrive and begin their preparations for the day. 
A NEW SWEEPER works in the adjacent room. 
The sun rises. 
EXT.  THE POTALA  DAY 
Like a painting, the beautiful monastery fills the screen with its white walls and red roof. 
Shouting is heard. 
GENERAL CHIANG (OC) I hate meeting here, this tribute to the past!  I demand a less formal meeting place. 
CLOSE on the red, bulging face of General Chiang. 
INT.  GREAT HALL, THE POTALA  DAY 
Behind the General hang fantastic thangkas of the Fifth Dalai Lama. 
GENERAL CHIANG I am not a foreigner! I refuse to be treated like one. 
The Dalai Lama is shaken by this violent behavior. He adjusts his new eye glasses. 
TENZIN GYATSO You see here thangkas of the Fifth Dalai Lama, the founder of our government.  It is tradition at formal meetings for these thangkas to be hung. 
GENERAL CHIANG Superstitions.  Tibet is part of a modern nation. 
The General sits. 
GENERAL CHIANG I want the songs stopped. 
TENZIN GYATSO Songs?  What songs? 
A slight smile. 
PRIME MINISTER LUKHANGWA Street songs about the General. Reference to his gold watch. He is right, they are quite insulting. 
TENZIN GYATSO I have no authority to ban singing in my country. 
GENERAL CHIANG You must also do something about the public meetings.  I see this, memorandum circulating, with Tibetan grievances. 
LUKHANGWA You have cracked a man's skull and that crack has not healed. It is too soon to expect him to be your friend. 
GENERAL CHIANG We are simply respecting the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement. 
LUKHANGWA Are you, General? 
GENERAL CHIANG We want 2,000 more tons of barley distributed. 
LUKHANGWA Impossible!  You will bring famine down on the people of Tibet with these insatiable demands! More food, the best land for your soldiers to camp. 
GENERAL CHIANG The People's Liberation Army pays for all food and lodging. 
LUKHANGWA So far, they do. But, the quantity, it does not exist.  You will have to re- evaluate your needs. 
The men glare at one another. 
GENERAL CHIANG How much tea do you drink, Prime Minister? 
LUKHANGWA It depends on the quality. And, that it be Indian. 
The General leaps to his feet and is about to strike the Prime Minister. 
The Dalai Lama runs between then.  He holds the General back. 
LUKHANGWA Why is it necessary for the Chinese to keep so many soldiers in Lhasa? 
GENERAL CHIANG To protect.  To serve you. Chairman Mao wants you to feel that China belongs to you now. 
LUKHANGWA Chairman Mao can keep China. Just give us back Tibet. 
The General backs away and brings himself under control. 
GENERAL CHIANG Plans for absorbing the Tibetan army into the People's Army will soon be finalized. 
LUKHANGWA I will not approve it. 
Mao Tse Tung's presence is charismatic.  His delivery is powerful - simple, yet firm.  He is spellbinding. 
MAO TSE TUNG The mission of China is to bring progress to Tibet.  Develop its natural resources.  Help its people develop democracy. We welcome you, Tibet, back to the Motherland! 
INT.  DALAI LAMA'S ROOM, CHINESE GUEST HOUSE  NIGHT 
Tenzin Gyatso snoops around this room.  He opens drawers, cabinets, just as a child would.  He finds odd little pieces of ceramics, pens, paper. 
He moves to the bathroom, runs a bath.  Hot water. Electricity.  This is the modern world. 
INT.  MAO'S OFFICE  DAY 
The Dalai Lama sits beside Chairman Mao as a horde of photographers flash bulbs in their faces.  Mao offers His Holiness a plate of Chinese delicacies. 
We notice that Mao's clothes are shabby and old. (His suit is always a shade lighter than everyone else's grey-drab). His cuffs are frayed, his collar is worn.  But, his shoes, are beautifully polished. 
He has exquisite, delicate hands and his skin is shinny. 
Later, Chairman Mao and the Dalai Lama sit across from one another. 
Tenzin Gyatso takes notes as Mao speaks. 
MAO TSE TUNG I am so glad that Tibet has come back to the Motherland. 
Tenzin Gyatso quietly sips his tea. 
MAO TSE TUNG You must inform me at once if any of our people abuse the Tibetans trust and good nature. 
TENZIN GYATSO I have great hopes for the future of our co-operation. 
MAO TSE TUNG It is too early to implement all the clauses of the Seventeen Point Agreement.  We will establish a Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region of Tibet.  The pace of reform must meet with the desires of the Tibetan people. Changes must be made slowly, as you, yourself, judge necessary. 
Mao speaks and moves very slowly.  He pants and wheezes.  He appears to be sick.  Tenzin Gyatso takes notes. 
TENZIN GYATSO I am happy to hear you say this, Chairman Mao.  I have created a reform committee to investigate grievances and we have abolished Inherited Tax, and forgiven all money owed the Government by people who are unable to pay. 
MAO TSE TUNG Good. Very good. Tibet is a great country.  A a wonderful history.  Long ago, you even conquered part of China. But now you have fallen behind and we want to help you.  In twenty years time you could be ahead of us. Then it will be your turn to help China. 
Tenzin Gyatso writes in his notebook. 
MAO TSE TUNG You know, I have great respect for your Lord Buddha.  He was anti-caste. Anti-corruption.  Anti-exploitation. For some, politics and religion can mix. 
TENZIN GYATSO For me, I think such a mix is crucial. 
MAO TSE TUNG Have a sweet. Made in my home province.  The kind my mother used to make. 
The Dalai Lama accepts. 
EXT.  GARDEN, GUEST HOUSE  DAY 
Tenzin Gyatso does physical exercise with a few Chinese Bodyguards. 
EXT.  GARDEN, GUEST HOUSE  DAY 
Tenzin Gyatso studies with Ling Rinpoche. The Lord Chamberlain sits with them. 
TENZIN GYATSO "If moral discipline is learned from the beginning, one possesses the root for achieving higher rebirth.  A staircase for achieving liberation.  An antidote eliminating misery and sorrow.  Without discipline there is no method." 
Pause. 
TENZIN GYATSO I am thinking of becoming a Communist Party Member. I like what I see of Marxism.  It is based on equality and justice for all. I believe Chairman Mao wishes the best for our people.  Our path must be non-violence.  Co-operation. 
The Lord Chamberlain simply looks at the young man.  He has nothing to say. 
INT.  MAO'S OFFICE  NIGHT 
There is a knock and Tenzin Gyatso is led into the room. 
Mao is at his desk, working late, smoking heavily. 
MAO TSE TUNG Ah, Dalai Lama, thank you for coming so late. 
TENZIN GYATSO I leave tomorrow. 
MAO TSE TUNG Yes, I am aware.  How has your time in China been? 
Tenzin Gyatso sits. He takes out his book and pen, ready to take notes. 
TENZIN GYATSO I have been greatly impressed by your accomplishments.  Industrial progress.  Great efficiency. Your people are capable and courteous. 
MAO TSE TUNG You have a lot to learn about organization.  How to draw out people's opinions.  How to make key decisions.  Train your young Tibetans.  When I make contact with you, I want to reach you through a Tibetan. 
DALAI LAMA Always. 
Tenzin Gyatso records Mao's words. 
MAO TSE TUNG Your attitude is good, you know. I understand you well. But you need to learn this: religion is poison. It undermines the race and it retards the progress of the people.  Tibet has been poisoned by religion. 
WOMEN (OC) Chinese, GO! Chinese, GO! Chinese, GO! 
EXT.  DALAI LAMA'S RESIDENCE, NORBULINKA  DAY 
Tenzin Gyatso steps outside.  The shouting grows louder: 
WOMEN AND MEN (OC) Chinese, GO! Chinese, GO! Chinese, GO! 
The young man looks around at the peaceful premises.  People we know - uembers of the Kashag, attendants, tutors, the Dalai Lama's Mother, sweepers - appear in the garden, one by one, all listening to the sounds of a uob gathering outside the walls of the Norbulinka. 
WOMEN AND HEN (OC) Chinese, GO! Chinese, GO! Chinese, GO! 
INT.  DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS, NORBULINKA  DAY 
A meeting is in progress. 
LORD CHAMBERLAIN The crowd will not disperse until you give your assurance that you will not attend the Chinese festivities. Many who have been invited to dine with the Chinese do not return home. 
TENZIN GYATSO I will not go. 
LORD CHAMBERLAIN I will alert the Chinese delegation. 
You know, I would never have let you go alone, Kundun. 
INT.  PARENTS'S HOME, NORBULINKA  DAY 
The Dalai Lama enters his Mother's home. 
It is very guiet here.  The young man looks at the family photographs on the blue walls, the needlework on the table, the seven copper bowls in front of the statue of Buddha. 
MOTHER (OC) Did you come to tell me we are leaving Lhasa? 
The boy fills the seven bowls with water.  His Mother lights the butter lamps. 
TENZIN GYATSO Do you think I must? 
MOTHER You decide. 
He says, softly: 
TENZIN GYATSO Tibet has never been part of China.  We are different races. We are different cultures. We need change, we know that. But we could do it alone. We were just about to do it alone. 
The young man fills the last bowl with water. 
TENZIN GYATSO I am afraid I will go. Far, far away. 
EXT.  GARDENS, NORBULINKA  DUSK 
The Lord Chamberlain approaches the Dalai Lama as he leaves his Mother's house. 
LORD CHAMBERLAIN We are now accused of aiding the rebels.  The Chinese said we can expect drastic measures to be taken to crush this revolt. 
TENZIN GYATSO Arrange for me to speak to the people's leaders. 
The Lord Chamberlain hurries away. 
INT.  DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS  DUSK 
A last meeting in session. 
The Kashag is present, as are fifty leaders of the opposition - rough, tired men. 
TENZIN GYATSO I fear that there will be great bloodshed if you cannot convince the people to disperse and go home. I am safe. 
FIRST LEADER Holiness, the Chinese tried to entice you to their garrison with out protection of bodyguard. Even now, they urge you to come to them for safety. They are bringing more troops and guns and artillery into Lhasa. There are three airplanes waiting outside Lhasa. What do they wait for?  They are planning to kill the Dalai Lama.  Don't you see? 
INT.  DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS  NIGHT 
The Dalai Lama consults the Nechung Oracle.  Alone. 
The Oracle whispers: 
NECHUNG ORACLE Stay. 
INT.  DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS  NIGHT 
It is late at night.  The boy is alone.  He sits in front of his altar - meditating. 
INT.  DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS  NIGHT 
The Nechung Oracle is brought in.  The monk quiets himself and readies himself for the trance. 
The Dalai Lama waits.  Again, alone. 
Slowly, the trance comes on, the heavy headdress is placed on the monk's head, the attendants leave the room and then, the Oracle speaks. 
NECHUNG ORACLE Stay.  I tell you to stay. 
CLOSE on the little cabinet in the corner of the entrance hall. 
Tenzin Gyatso's hands open the doors. 
The young man pulls open the drawer which contains the false teeth. 
Tenzin Gyatso pulls a rolled kata from his coat.  He tucks the lead soldier of an Indian Ghurka into the center of the scarf.  He places the bundle in the drawer. 
Then, he adds something.  A sweet.  The kind his Mother makes. 
He closes the drawer, and locks it. 
He hides the key, again, behind the small, unobtrusive cabinet. 
EXT.  RESIDENCE, STAIRS  NIGHT 
With a soldier on either side of him, the Dalai Lama descends the staircase. 
The Soldiers start to lead him away, but he pauses. 
TENZIN GYATSO Wait. 
The young man leaves them. 
EXT.  RESIDENCE  NIGHT 
He walks to the far side of this white building. 
TENZIN GYATSO I see a safe journey. 
The boy returns to the front steps. 
TENZIN GYATSO I see a safe return. 
The soldiers wait. 
TENZIN GYATSO Now.  I am ready. 
Tenzin Gyatso places the scroll over one shoulder.  A soldier lays a rifle over the other one. 
EXT.  GARDENS, NORBULINKA  NIGHT 
The three men walk quietly through the empty gardens.  We hear the sounds of the crowd grow louder. 
EXT.  WALL  NIGHT 
The soldiers pause, look to His Holiness.  Tenzin Gyatso removes his glasses, puts them in his bag, then nods - and the soldiers open the gate. 
SOLDIER Move aside, tour of inspection, move aside. 
Of course, we see only a fraction of the crowd - angry men and women. 
A man steps beside His Holiness. 
Tenzin Gyatso looks up - face to face. 
It is the Khamba bodyguard, the monk who guarded him so many times.  The man with the horrible face. 
KHAMBA BODYGUARD Move aside, let us through. Move aside! 
The Dalai Lama is between the soldiers, shouldering his own gun.  The Bodyguard falls in behind. 
The little group makes its way through the crowd. 
EXT.  TRIBUTARY OF ThE KYICHU RIVER  NIGHT 
In the same place where the little Tenzin Gyatso tentatively tested one rock, the escape party crosses on the slippery, stepping stones. 
EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE  NIGHT 
The small party makes its way across a bit of countryside. 
People are camped here - Khambas, farmers, nomads.  The Dalai Lama crosses to safety - unnoticed. 
EXT.  KYICHU RIVER  NIGHT 
Coracles await. 
The Dalai Lama climbs in, the Lord Chmaberlian sits beside him.  The soldiers push off. The Khamba Bodyguard stands on the bank, alone. 
Every splash of the oars sounds like it could wake the dead. 
Tenzin Gyatso looks back.  He puts on his glasses. 
He sees camp fires and the glow of torches.  He hears echoed voices. 
He looks up.  He sees the stars and the moon and that incomparable Tibetan sky.

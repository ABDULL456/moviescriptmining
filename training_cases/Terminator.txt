A1      TITLE SEQUENCE - SLITSCAN EFFECT                       A1 
1       EXT. SCHOOLYARD - NIGHT                                1 
Silence.  Gradually the sound of distant traffic becomes audible.  A LOW ANGLE bounded on one side by a chain-link fence and on the other by the one-story public school build- ings.  Spray-can hieroglyphics and distant streetlight sha- dows.  This is a Los Angeles public school in a blue collar neighborhood. 
ANGLE BETWEEN SCHOOL BUILDINGS, where a trash dumpster looms in a LOW ANGLE, part of the clutter behind the gymnasium. A CAT enters FRAME.  CAMERA DOLLIES FORWARD, prowling with him through the landscape of trash receptacles and shadows. 
CLOSE ON CAT, which freezes, alert, sensing something just beyond human perception. 
A sourceless wind rises, and with it a keening WHINE. Papers blow across the pavement. The cat YOWLS and hides under the dumpster. Windows rattle in their frames. The WHINE intensifies, accompanied now by a wash of frigid PURPLE LIGHT.  A CONCUSSION like a thunderclap right over- head blows in all the windows facing the yard. 
C.U. - CAT, its eyes are wide as the glare dies. 
1A/FX   ANGLE - DUMPSTER                                       1A/FX 
ELECTRICAL DISCHARGES arc from the dumpster to a water faucet and climb a drain pipe like a Jacob's Ladder.

2       EXT. SCHOOLYARD - NIGHT                                2 
SLOW PAN as the sound of stray electrical CRACKLING subsides. FRAME comes to rest on the figure of a NAKED MAN kneeling, faced away, in the previously empty yard. He stands, slowly. The man is in his late thirties, tall and powerfully built, moving with graceful precision. 
C.U. - MAN, his facial features reiterate the power of his body and are dominated by the eyes, which are intense, blue and depthless.  His hair is military short. 
This man is the TERMINATOR. 
He glances down, taking calm inventory of himself, and notices that a fine white ash covers his skin.  He brushes at it unconcernedly as he walks toward the fence, scanning his surroundings. 
CUT TO: 
2A/FX   CRANE SHOT - SCHOOLYARD/CITY - NIGHT                   2A/FX 
CAMERA MOVES UP as Terminator approaches the schoolyard fence beyond which is an embankment rolling down in darkness to the cityscape below.  The school is perched at the edge of a pro- montory offering a respectable view of the urban sprawl teem- ing and glistening under a sullen sky.  The night clouds are shot through with occasional flashes of LIGHTNING, presaging a thunderstorm. 
Terminator stands, hands on hips in prefect symmetry, gazing down at the city as the CAMERA REACHES FULL HEIGHT. 
CUT TO: 
3       EXT. PLAYGROUND - NIGHT                               3 
A beer bottle SMASHES on the ground.  PULL BACK to include its ex-owner and his two compatriots, YOUTH GANG MEMBERS, lounging on the jungle gym of a deserted playground.  They sport nondescript PUNK REGALIA...torn T-shirts, fatigue pants, combat boots or high-top sneakers, leather jackets. 
The leader notices something and sits up. 
LEADER (pointing) Hey, hey...what's wrong with this picture? 
ANGLE - REVERSE, seen past the lounging toughs, Terminator walks naked into a pool of streetlight, striding purpose- fully toward them. 
ANGLE - OVER TERMINATOR'S SHOULDER, as he approaches them. They slide from their perches and drop easily to the ground liquid shadows. 
LEADER Nice night for a walk, eh? 
Terminator stops right in front of them. 
TERMINATOR (without inflec- tion) Nice night for a walk. 
They surround him, all swagger and malign good humor. 
SECOND PUNK Washday tomorrow, huh?  Nothing clean, right? 
Terminator eyes them without expression, unhurried. Reptilian. 
TERMINATOR Nothing clean.  Right. 
LEADER This guy's a couple bricks short. 
Terminator turn to the second punk, ignoring the others. 
TERMINATOR Your clothes.  Give them to me. 
The punks exchange glances, dismayed. 
TERMINATOR (coldly) Now. 
SECOND PUNK (bracing) Fuck you, asshole. 
Without warning Terminator hammer-punches him in the temple with blinding speed.  The blow flings him with a CLANG into the jungle gym.  He drops to the ground in a still heap, eyes open, twitching. 
The leader whips out his SWITCHBLADE and slashes in one motion.  Terminator ducks back and catches the knife- wielder's wrist in an inhuman grip.  Then he punches the leader with piledriver force just below the breastbone. 
ANGLE - PAVEMENT, as the knife clatters down.  The punk's combat boots are on tiptoe, barely touching the ground. 
ANGLE - TWO SHOT, Terminator and the leader are close together as if dancing, but motionless.  Their bodies are in total shadow.  The punk's eyes are wide, his veins distended with an agonizing pressure.  Terminator jerks his fist back with a WET SOUND and the other drops OUT OF FRAME. 
Reese finds himself among the display racks of a discount department store.  A searchlight stabs in the front window as he dashes into the maze of aisles. 
Three cops enter behind him through the shattered door. 
FAST PANAGLIDE WITH REESE, as he crab-runs low among the moving shadows where flashlights quarter the darkness.  He bolts the open space behind a display window.  Sees the outside searchlight sweep toward him.  Freezes. 
ANGLE - REESE, his feral face frozen among the smooth- featured, smiling mannequins.  As the light passes, Reese silently moves on. 
ANGLE - COP, passing the end of a long aisle B.G. while in the F.G. a hand ENTERS FRAME, removing a knit shirt from a hanger.  Reese slips the shirt on quietly and does a fast crab-walk across the aisles to melt into the other racks and shadows, CAMERA MOVING LOW with him. 
CUT TO: 
13      INT. DEPARTMENT STORE/AISLE - NIGHT                    13 
With a shocking GROWL the police dog hurtles out of the shadows, LEAPING RIGHT AT CAMERA. 
ANGLE - REESE AND DOG, a dark blur with teeth, extremely Doberman, flies toward Reese.  He spins.  Catches it by the throat in mid-air. Arcs it to the floor with unflinching precision. 
C.U. - DOBERMAN, suddenly on its back and held by the throat, THE DOG YELPS and stares at Reese, who leans very close. Inches from its eyes he fixes it with a gaze of uncompromis- ing dominance.  Some ancient communication seems to pass between the two. 
Reese releases the animal and turns his back on it, selecting a long overcoat from a rack.  The dog backs away from him, stiff-legged and confused. 
CUT TO: 
14      INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - NIGHT                          14 
TRACKING WITH REESE as he rounds a corner on the run, still shrugging into his long coat. Running smack at him is another cop, gun aimed. 
Without slowing, Reese leaps toward him, twisting in mid-air like a cat.  The cop FIRES. Misses.  Goes down under Reese's tackle and they slide together on the polished floor. 
Before they even come to rest Reese snatches the cop's gun, aiming it at the other's face two-handed. 
REESE What day is it?  The date... 
COP Thursday...uh...May twelfth. 
REESE (viciously) What year? 
A SHOT whines off the metal side of an escalator behind Reese's head.  He vaults the escalator rail, leaving the amazed cop lying on the floor. 
Reese bounds up the frozen steps, pocketing the .38 Police Special in his coat. 
Cops dash through the maze of aisles, converging at the escalators. 
CUT TO: 
15      INT. DEPARTMENT STORE/SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT             15 
WHIP PANNING WITH REESE, as he hurtles between displays. He stops for a moment beside a rack of shoes.  Slaps one of a pair of tennis shoes sole-to-sole against his bare foot. Too small.  Another.  Holding the shoes he runs on. 
CUT TO: 
16      EXT. SECOND FLOOR FIRE ESCAPE LANDING - NIGHT          16 
A door opens quietly and Reese slips out. 
CAMERA TRACKS WITH HIM as he moves like a panther along the narrow catwalk.  TILT DOWN to include the first LAPD cruiser parked at the mouth of the alley. 
CUT TO: 
17      EXT. ALLEY/STREET - NIGHT                              17 
Reese drops cat-like beside the unattended police car. Cautiously, he opens the door of the cruiser, removes the RIOT GUN, an Ithaca pump model, from the dash rack and slips it under his coat.  Cradled in a vertical position, the shortened weapon is virtually invisible. 
He walks out onto the street and away,  unhurriedly, an innocuous pedestrian soon lost in the rain. 
CUT TO: 
18      EXT. STREET/NEARBY - NIGHT                             18 
Reese enters a telephone booth.  Harsh light rakes across his face, outlining the long scar.  He opens the directory, leafs through it. 
ANGLE - MACRO ON PAGE, Reese's finger slides down a column. Stops beside the following listings in the big metropolitan white pages: CONNOR, SARAH CONNOR, SARAH ANN CONNOR, SARAH J. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
19      EXT. CITY STREET - MORNING                             19 
The night's rain has given way to a typical L.A. morning of diffuse sunlight. 
MOVING WITH A GIRL on a MOPED as she zips through traffic. SARAH CONNER is 19, small and delicate-featured.  Pretty in a flawed, accessible way. She doesn't stop the party when she walks in, but you'd like to get to know her.  Her vulner- able quality masks a strength even she doesn't know exists. 
Sarah maneuvers nimbly, apparently in a hurry. 
CUT TO: 
20      EXT. BIG BOB'S RESTRAUNT - DAY                         20 
Sarah buzzes into the parking lot of Big Bob's Family Restaurant and chains the moped to the icon of Big Bob himself.  The fiberglass cherub holds up his mammoth hamburger in perpetual homage to whatever deity watches out for fat kids. Sarah removes a stack of college textbooks from the luggage carrier and tuns to go into the restaurant. 
SARAH (to Big Bob) Watch this for me, big buns.

21      INT. BIG BOB'S/DINING AREA                             21 
HIGH WIDE SHOT prominently featuring a VIDEO SURVEILLANCE CAMERA F.G. as Sarah enters below.  She passes under another video eye as she crosses the main floor of the wholesomely appointed eatery.  Sarah goes through the swinging STAFF doors under a third camera. 
TIGHT ON GLASS COUNTERTOP as an AR-180 ASSAULT RIFLE WITH SCOPE is laid beside a number of other guns: a COLT K- MODEL .45 ACP, a SMITH AND WESSON .38 FOUR-INCH, a BERETTA .225 ACP. 
TERMINATOR (V.O.) ...the Remington 1100 Autoloader... 
WIDE as the CLERK, who looks like a sick lizard, pallid and paunchy, takes the rifle from a wall rack.  He lays it beside the arsenal of perfectly legal anti-human artillery already on the glass counter. Terminator scans expressionlessly for additional selec- tions. 
CLERK Anything else? 
TERMINATOR A phased plasma pulse-laser in the forty watt range... 
CLERK (annoyed) Just what you see, pal. 
He indicates the display case and wall racks with a minimal gesture. 
TERMINATOR The Uzi 9 millimeter. 
CLERK (setting  it out) You know your weapons, buddy. 
Terminator examines each in turn, working the actions with curt, precise movements. 
CLERK (continuing) Any one of them's ideal for home defense. Which'll it be? 
TERMINATOR All. 
The clerk digs deep and finds a scrap of a smile. 
CLERK Maybe I'll close early. Cash or charge? 
Instead of replying, Terminator takes a box of shotgun shells from a stack on the display case. 
CLERK Sorry, I can't sell the ammo with the guns.  You'll have to---Hey! 
Terminator has calmly begun feeding the shells into the shotgun. 
CLERK (continuing) You can't to that... 
TERMINATOR (evenly) Wrong. 
He raises the barrel and pulls the trigger.  The gun THUNDERS. 
CUT TO: 
30      EXT. GAS STATION/PHONE BOOTH - DAY                     30 
The yellow Maverick pulls to a stop beside a single phone booth. 
MOVING WITH TERMINATOR, as he gets out, walks to the booth and rapidly pulls its occupant out by his greasy T-shirt, flinging him backward into the parking lot.  The guy is bear-like, slab-handed, but Terminator doesn't even glance back as he steps in to take the man's place. 
MAN (outraged) Hey, man... 
CUT TO: 
31      PHONE BOOTH 
A woman's voice, a faint reedy monologue, issues from the dangling receiver. Terminator leafs rapidly through the directory. 
ANGLE - C.U. PAGES FLIPPING 
ANGLE - MACRO SHOT, as Terminator's finger comes to rest beside a now-familiar listing: CONNOR, SARAH 
CUT TO: 
32      INT. BIG BOB'S/DINING AREA 
Sarah is bustling about, trying to service the start of the dinner rush.  In waitress parlance, she's 'in it'. She runs the gauntlet between tables, precariously balancing two full dinner plates on one arm and hand-carrying a third.  A customer tugs on her apron for attention and she barely averts contributing the chili size to his wardrobe. 
CUSTOMER Honey, can I get that coffee now? 
SARAH Yes sir, just a second. 
She reaches her table after near collisions with a Mexican busboy and two teenage girls doing cheerleading routines in lock-step. 
SARAH Who gets the Burly Burger? 
CUSTOMER TWO I ordered Barbecue Beef. 
CUSTOMER THREE Does mine come with fires? 
CUSTOMER FOUR He's got the Barbecue Beef, I've got a Chili-Beef Deluxe. 
SARAH Okay, who gets the Burly Beef? 
CUSTOMER AT NEXT TABLE Miss, we're ready to order. 
In the process of setting down all the plates Sarah knocks over someone's water glass. 
SARAH (mopping fran- tically) Oh, sorry.  That's not real leather, is it? 
As she cleans up the spill, a kid at the next booth reaches over and dumps a scoop of ice cream into the top pouch of Sarah's apron 
She stares down at the mess melting over her hard-earned and sags with defeat.  NANCY, a plump, gum-chewing waitress, stops beside her to whisper. 
NANCY Look at it this way: in a hundred years, who's gonna care? 
CUT TO: 
33      EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY 
Reese looks over his shoulder at his teammate, a GIRL of about sixteen, gaunt, dirty, heavily armed like himself. DOLLYING as they start to belly crawl through the bones and wreckage. Reese looks up. Through spires of a collapsed building a terrifying SPHINX-LIKE SHAPE moves against the sky...obscured by dust and blinding sweeps of its searchlights. Though we see little, this is an H-K,Hunter-Killer mobile ground-unit. 
Reese crawls, pacing the H-K, under and through, on elbows and knees, past mounds of charred skulls.  They pass the BODY OF A CHILD, a boy of about 10, center- punched with a smoking hole.  The boy clutches a rifle. More bodies.  Some in rags, some in uniforms like theirs. WOMEN. OLD MEN. CHILDREN.  They're all dirty and gaunt, scabrous.  And still bleeding.  Reese scrabbles past a dark rat-hole and there are human rats in it.  Some of them are sobbing, or screaming. 
Another EXPLOSION. The GLARE lights the huddled few. Human vermin with mud-caked weapons that haven't been invented yet.  Soldiers in a nightmare war. 
Reese and his teammate stop behind a blasted wall, having outflanked the massive H-K.  Its flashing blue lights flick across the walls, its searchlights sear through the debris. 
WIDER, showing the H-K more clearly...a blast-scarred CHROME LEVIATHON, with hydraulic arms folded mantis-like against its 'torso', and huge underslung GUN TURRETS. 
Reese leaps up and straight-arms a satchel-charge into its path.  One tread rolls over the explosive. Guns and searchlights swivel.  The head turns ponderously. Reese's partner rises, poised to throw hers. A POWER-BOLT catches her at the top of her arc, BLOWING HER INTO RED MIST. 
Reese is knocked down by the concussion.  Gets up, running, as the charges blow. The H-K's tread carriers are RIPPED APART. It lurches to a stop, burning. 
The following SEQUENCE is extremely FORESHORTENED. CUT FAST.  IMPRESSIONS ONLY. Running. Explosions light the ruins like flashbulbs. ENERGY WEAPONS criss-cross the night like tracers. LOW ANGLE, up past the burning H-K as its flying counter- part, an AERIAL H-K, arcs into view with a TURBOJET WHINE. 
Reese hauls two survivors of his unit into a PERSONNEL CARRIER, a CHEVY CAMARO with steel plate welded over it and the roof cut away to access the 50 CALIBER MACHINE GUN. It's stripped and rusted and bullet-riddled, glassless. The TIRES are OFF-ROAD and very gnarly. 
They're driving through the ruins, up and over and through. Reese drives like a demon.  Under other circumstances it would be considered insane.  Here it is merely very good. 
The machine gun CHATTERS. A BLACK SHAPE descends, a demon with searchlights. A BOLT OF LIGHT. 
Reese's car flips like a kicked beer can, rolling and crumpling.  He's pinned in the wreck, bloody, screaming despite his training.  The only other survivor, an emaciated BOY of twelve, is pulling for all he's worth to drag Reese out before it burns. 
CUT TO: 
47      EXT. STREET/GREY SEDAN - NIGHT                         47 
CLOSE ON A BOY, about twelve, clean and healthy, wearing a blue plastic DODGERS HELMET.  He reaches through the window of the sedan. 
BOY Hey, mister...? 
CUT TO: 
48      INT. GREY SEDAN                                        48 
Reese's eyes open in a split-second, and suddenly there is a SHOTGUN MUZZLE AIMED RIGHT AT US. Reese quivers with a curious spasm, similar to the tremors of his arrival, and blinks at the boy. 
The boy is white-faced, staring down the bore.  He backs away.  We see that he is straddling a bicycle. 
CUT TO: 
49      EXT. GREY SEDAN - NIGHT                                49 
The boy's SISTER, slightly younger and also on a bicycle, can't see the shotgun from where she's waiting. 
SISTER (taunting) See, I told you he wasn't dead.  You owe me Baskin Robbins. 
The boy rides past her list a shot. 
BOY (urgently) Come on.  Just come on. 
CUT TO: 
50      INT. GREY SEDAN                                        50 
Reese relaxes slowly, the voltage draining out of him. 
INSERT - MACRO, Reese's finger on the trigger is white with pressure.  He slips the safety to the OFF position. The gun can now be fired. 
He sets it on the seat and reaches for the dangling ignition wires, starting the car. 
CUT TO: 
51      EXT. STREET/OVERPASS - NIGHT                           51

53      INT. SARAH'S APARTMENT/BATHROOM/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT    53 
Sarah and Ginger are crammed into the tiny bathroom, becoming inextricably tangled in each other's cords as they blow-dry, curl hair, and apply make-up.  Ginger has her headphones inverted under her chin but in place, and is bouncing to music as she dries her hair.  She is wearing a short terry-cloth bathrobe that reveals the greater part of her legs.  Sarah is in a skirt and bra. 
The phone rings and Sarah goes out into the living room to get it. 
SARAH (answering the phone) Hello? 
VOICE (V.O.) (on phone, deep and breathy) First I'm going to rip the buttons off your blouse, one by one...then run my tongue along your neck, down to your bare, gleaming breasts... 
Sarah cups her hand over the mouthpiece and calls out matter-of-factly: 
SARAH Ginger!  It's Matt. 
She resumes listening. 
MATT (V.O.) ...and then slowly pull your jeans off inch by inch and lick your belly in circles, further and further down... then I'll pull off your panties with my teeth... 
Sarah is repressing laughter. 
SARAH (crossly) Who is this? 
Silence.  Then Matt realizes to his horror who he's been talking to. 
MATT (V.O.) Oh my God!  Sarah!  Oh, shit. Jesus, I'm sorry.  I thought you were...Can I talk to Ginger? 
CUT TO: 
59      INT. LIVING ROOM 
Sarah walks around the room, searching for something. 
SARAH (calling) Ginger, have you seen Pugsley? 
Ginger enters, stopping beside their phone answering machine. 
GINGER Not lately.  Did you check messages? 
SARAH (still looking) I thought you did. 
She checks under the couch, then behind the drapes.  She bends down. 
SARAH (from beside cur- tains) Come here young man.  Mind your mother. 
C.U. - PUGSLEY, as the GREEN IGUANA cocks its head, blinking vapidly. 
RESUME WIDE, Sarah lifts the three foot long lizard from his perch on the windowsill.  She gives the complacent reptile a kiss on its blunt snout. 
GINGER (groaning) Totally nauseating. 
Sarah drapes the lizard across her shoulders where it sits contentedly as she looks for her purse.  Ginger has been rewinding the message tape.  She punches PLAY and a MALE VOICE is heard. 
VOICE (recorded) 
Hi, Sarah...Stan Morsky. Uh, something's come up and it looks like I won't be able to make it tonight.  I'm really sorry.  Call you in a day or so. Sorry.  'Bye. 
Sarah stands still, crestfallen. 
GINGER That bum.  So what if he has a Porsche, he can't treat you like that...it's Friday night for crissakes. 
SARAH (slumping) 
I'll live. 
GINGER I'll break his kneecaps. 
Sarah resignedly slips Pugsley off her shoulders. 
SARAH You still love me, don't you, Pugsley? 
She places Pugsley in a large terrarium with a 'BEWARE OF DOG' sign taped on the side. 
SARAH (continuing) I'm going to a movie, kiddo. See ya'.  You and Matt have a good time. 
GINGER (as Sarah exits) We will, kiddo.

60      INT. PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT 
Sarah is a small figure in the shadowed echoing garage of her building. 
CONVERGING DOLLY, PACING HER, as she passes the stalls with their inky shadows. The light near her moped is out. She fumbles in the dark to unlock the chain. She looks up. Did she hear something...masked by the rattle of the chain? 
POV - SARAH, there is no movement for the length of the garage. 
ON SARAH - C.U., inexplicably nervous. She stows the chain and starts the bike.  It whines reassuringly. Sarah jumps on and whirs out of the garage. 
CUT TO: 
61      INT. CAR/NEARBY - NIGHT                                61 
Sarah is visible through the windshield as she pulls onto the street. 
PAN WITH HER to reveal Kyle Reese, hunched down in shadow, watching.  He puts the car in gear and pulls out to follow her receding tail-light. Streetlights flash across his face, in stark-lines profile. Mouth cruel where the scar tugs at it.

62      INT. DIVISION HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT                     62 
DOLLYING WITH VUKOVICH and TRAXLER, as they pass through a group of REPORTERS.  Mostly newspaper stringers but there is also one bored local TV MINICAM CREW. 
REPORTER ...Lieutenant, are you aware that these two killings occurred in the same order as their listings in the phone book? 
VUKOVICH No comment. 
He and Traxler enter their office and shut the door. 
CUT TO: 
63      VUKOVICH'S OFFICE                                      63 
Vukovich drops his gun in the wastebasket, picks up a cup of coffee from his desk and uses it to wash down a handful of aspirins.  Traxler grimaces. 
TRAXLER That stuff's two hours cold. 
VUKOVICH (nodding ab- sently) I know. 
TRAXLER (eyeing him) I put a cigarette out in it. 
Vukovich, lost in thought, turns on him suddenly. 
VUKOVICH Did you reach the next girl yet?

CUT TO: 
71      EXT. STREET/SIDEWALK - NIGHT                           71 
Sarah exits the pizza place into the sparse crowd on the sidewalk.  As she passes a figure leaning against the wall just outside, the man turns his head to watch her. It is Reese, his gaze impassive. Streetlight catches the burn scar on his cheek. He is motionless, sinister in his long coat. Sarah shudders. She walks on. 
POV - SARAH, ON CROWD, moving toward and through approaching groups of pedestrians.  They seem to be glancing at her. Was it always like that and she just never noticed? 
C.U. - SARAH as she look over her shoulder. 
POV - SARAH, ON PIZZA PARLOR DOORWAY.  Reese is gone. She resists the urge to run. On the opposite side of the street an  LAPD cruiser glides slowly by.  Sarah is about to call out but a bus blocks her view and when it had passed, the car is turning away down a side street. 
She passes a large window with STOKER'S written on it, and ducks quickly through the door.

ANGLE THROUGH WINDOW, SARAH F.G., as Reese approaches. Her knuckles clench white as he reaches the entrance and walks by, unhurriedly, without a glance inside. She turns and scan the gloomy interior, which reveals itself to be less than savory.  Pool tables and upper-middle lowlife in submarine depths of smoky haze. 
Sarah draws stares, menacing in their own right, as she weaves between the pool tables to the back of the bar. her hands are trembling as she drops a dime in the pay phone and dials. 
VOICE (V.O./RECORDED) You have reached the Los Angeles Police Department Emergency Number. All lines are busy.  If you need a police car sent out to you, please stay on the line... 
Sarah holds the receiver pressed to her ear, glancing around, fear feeding on frustration. 
CUT TO: 
73      EXT. SARAH'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT                73 
An LAPD black-and-white sits at the curb in front of Sarah's building with two cops inside, drinking coffee.  Through the open window we hear the dispatcher's voice on the radio. 
DISPATCHER (V.O.) ...two eleven in progress at Seven-Eleven market, Third and Tamarac.  One suspect believed to be armed... 
The car pulls out with lights and siren on. A moment later, Terminator rounds the corner of the building and climbs the stairs to the entryway. He surveys the bank of call buttons, then turns to consider the barred security gate.

74      INT. SARAH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                         74 
PANAGLIDE WITH GINGER as she ties her terry-cloth robe and, leaving Matt in a dead sleep, pads through the dark apartment. Down the hall, past the phone with Traxler's message. Through the dark living room. She has her Walkman in the pocket of her robe and bops to herself in the silent gloom as she enters the kitchen. 
When she opens the refrigerator to remove snack fixings, the light briefly illuminates the kitchen and in that moment, SOMETHING MOVES in the F.G. 
TIGHT ON GINGER, MOVING WITH HER as she backs toward the counter with her arms full of snack stuff. 
A SUDDEN CRASH.  A flurry of motion behind her. She spins, dropping half her load. Ginger fumbles for the lightswitch. 
Revealing Pugsley, sitting there blinking innocently among overturned spice bottles on the counter-top. 
GINGER Shoo.  Go on.  I'll make a belt out of you. 
Pugsley disappears into a large fern by the window and Ginger sets about her task, slathering crunchy peanut butter on stalks of celery.

MEDIUM ON MATT, as rustling curtains play patterns of street- light over his sleeping face. The sound of a faint breeze. In the B.G. is the balcony, empty.  The sliding door is open. 
TIGHT ON MATT, as his eyes open at the sound of a quiet, repeated CLICKING. 
UP ANGLE - PAST MATT, as the five-inch blade of an industrial razor-knife reaches full extension in Terminator's hand, right above him. It slashes viciously downward. Matt rolls and the pillow is SLIT OPEN where his throat had been. 
MATT Whoah! 
Terminator catches him by the hair and slashed down again. Matt grabs the wrist in both hands. The enormous muscles of his arms, which seem capable of bench pressing a Chrysler, strain and knot against the pressure of the killer's single arm... And still the blade moves closer to his throat. 
With a final heave Matt deflects the down-pressure sideways and the blade snaps with a CLINK against the headboard. 
HANDHELD WITH MATT as he rolls off the bed, spins and slams his fists together into Terminator's temple.  He picks up a brass deco lamp and brings it down with piledriver force. 
Unperturbed, Terminator knocks the lamp away and hurls Matt over the bed.

Oblivious to the noise, Ginger croons in rock-and-roll ecstasy, singing to a celery stalk as if it were a micro- phone. 
CUT TO: 
78      EXT./INT. BALCONY AND BEDROOM - NIGHT                  78 
Matt heaves himself up, powerful body gleaming with sweat and hurls himself upon the intruder. The titans CRASH INTO A DRESSER, reducing it to kindling. Then into the closet door, EXPLODING THE FULL-LENGTH MIRROR. 
SARAH (on phone) Yes, but I don't want to leave.  I think this guy's following me. 
CUT TO:

VUKOVICH (on phone) Alright, Ms. Connor.  Listen carefully.  You're in a public place, you'll be safe 'til we get there.  Stay visible. Don't go outside or in the restroom.  I'll be there in a few minutes. 
He hangs up and grabs his coat, motioning to Traxler. 
VUKOVICH Let's roll.

91      INT. STOKER'S BAR - NIGHT                              91 
The waitress set a cup of coffee in front of Sarah. 
WAITRESS Anything else? 
Sarah shakes her head "No" and contemplates her trembling hands.  She half-turns, catching a glimpse of herself in the mirror behind the bar. 
TIGHT ON SARAH, reflected in the mirror.  In the F.G. a man at the bar looks up from his beer, straight into her eyes. It is Reese. He gazes at her coolly for a moment, then glances away. 
C.U. - SARAH, feeling trapped, frantic. 
ANGLE ON FRONT DOOR as it opens and a figure stands silhou- etted briefly against a streetlight. 
Reese turns, his eyes flickering to the mirror, the figure. 
C.U. - REESE as he mechanically raises his beer.  His knuckles are white.  He slowly undoes the top button of his overcoat. There is a glint of metal in the shadows within. Reese turns slowly on his barstool as the figure brushes past him, out-of-focus F.G. Sarah looks up. 
E.C.U. - REESE'S HAND sliding slowly along polished steel, a caress.  His finger slips through the triggerguard of the riot gun. 
MEDIUM ON SARAH, as the man stops in front of her in close F.G. He sits slowly in the booth opposite her.  The angle is OVER HIS SHOULDER. 
SARAH (uncertainly) Lieutenant Vukovich? 
REVERSE ANGLE - It is not Lt. Vukovich. Terminator sits motionless for a BEAT. Blue eyes so pure and deep.  The eyes of a saint, perhaps. 
The .45 is out and cocked and AIMED DIRECTLY AT CAMERA, almost in one motion. The bore seems enormous. 
BACK ON SARAH, over the gun barrel, her eyes go wide.  We hold a BEAT, like a frozen slice of nightmare. 
MEDIUM ON REESE as he whips the riot-gun to a hip-firing posi- tion, his overcoat falling back with a snap.  HE FIRES. 
ON TERMINATOR, as the shotgun blast hits his arm and he FIRES, simultaneously.  Sarah screams as the .45 round blows stuffing out of the booth seat inches from her face.  Her hair is singed by burning gunpowder.  An involuntary cry is punched out of her by the double concussions. 
Reese is stroking up another shell as Terminator half-rises from booth. 
OVER REESE'S SHOULDER, as he fires, cocks the slide, fires again, advancing on Sarah's booth. Terminator is blown backward over the center divider, crashing through the glasses and pitchers of beer on the table opposite, and onto the floor. 
Sarah is screaming, scrunched down in the booth. 
Terminator is lying on his back at the feet of a table- full of drunk patrons. He has two rifled 12 gauge slugs in his chest and one in the arm. 
The bar customers are frozen in the weird tableau, cowering, gaping. Sarah stops screaming. Reese stand motionless, gun aimed. In the sudden silence, the sound of him cocking the shotgun is abnormally loud. 
ON TERMINATOR, very still. Then he smoothly rolls to a crouch and slips the UZI machine pistol from beneath his overcoat, where it has been hang- ing on a shoulder strap. He doesn't seem too impaired as he swings around to fire. 
Reese rolls like a cat and comes up firing. A burst from the UZI rakes the bar where he stood. An orgy of shattering glass. Total pandemonium. 
SEVERAL ANGLES  as patrons of the bar run, scream or dive for cover, depending upon their level of intelligence. 
Reese slides through the glass to Sarah's booth and seizes her wrists. 
ON TERMINATOR, kneeling amid the chaos, raising the UZI one-handed. 
Reese tugs viciously on Sarah's arm and she sprawls across the booth seat a moment before the divider and seat cushion erupt with hits from the UZI. 
ANGLE ON A RUNNING PATRON as a burst of 9mm fire catches him in the chest.  He pitches into Sarah's booth, pinning her. 
Reese fires, ducks, fires again. Tables crash over. A window is blown out. A table candle rolls into a pool of high-proof alcohol behind the bar. It ignites with a WHOOSH. 
Reese feed two shells into the riot-gun. 
At that moment a blinding light sears down on them from above.  Reese looks over his left shoulder and sees a CHP cruiser coming alongside. 
REESE Just a second.  Keep your head down. 
CUT TO:

The helicopter is right above the, its spotlight burning on Reese.  The cruiser flanks them, closing.  Reese peels off to the right, inches in front of a tractor-trailer rig, brakes hard and slides into a four-wheel drift through a curving off-ramp. The helicopter banks, following. The cruiser swaps ends trying to maneuver and slams broad- side into the guardrail.  Out of action.

Reese is ultra-alert, craning to look up, back, forward. 
REESE Good cover. (pause) Alright.  Listen. The Terminator's an infil- tration unit.  Part man, part machine.  Underneath, it's a hyperalloy combat chassis, mircoprocessor-controlled, fully  armored. Very tough... 
He pauses as they slide around another corner.

REESE (continuing) But outside, it's living human tissue.  Flesh, skin, hair...blood.  Grown for the cyborgs. 
SARAH Look, Reese, I know you want to help, but... 
REESE (cutting her off) Pay attention.  The 600 series had rubber skin. We spotted them easy.  But these are new.  They look human.  Sweat, bad breath, everything.  Very hard to spot.  I had to wait 'til he moved on you before I could zero him. 
SARAH Hey, I'm not stupid, y'know. They can't build anything like that yet. 
REESE No.  Not yet.  Not for about forty years. 
Reese is driving sedately for a low profile, but his eyes rove constantly, searching for a place to ditch the car. Sarah's eyes are alert as well, and her tone becomes a bit too cool. 
SARAH So, it's from the future, is that right? 
REESE One possible future.  Four your point of view.  I don't know the tech stuff. 
SARAH And you're from the future too? 
REESE Right. 
They come to a red light and Reese stops. 
SARAH (patronizingly) Right... 
Like a shot she unlatches the seatbelt, pulls the door lock and has the door half open before Reese can react.  He catches her arm and hauls her struggling back into the car. 
Sarah sinks her teeth into his hand with all her strength. His grip doesn't slacken. Slowly, without releasing her, he reaches across with his other hand and shuts the door.  His face shows no reaction. 
Sarah draws back and stares at the blood running down his arm from the bite, that at his grim, scarred face.  The light turns green and Reese drives on. Sarah tastes blood and wipes her mouth. 
REESE (coldly) Cyborgs don't feel pain.  I do.  Don't...do that...again. 
He wipes his hand on his pants. 
SARAH (weakly, plead- ing) Just let me go. 
REESE (slow, but intense) Listen.  Understand.  That Terminator is out there.  It can't be reasoned with, it can't be bargained with...it doesn't feel pity of remorse or fear... and it absolutely will not stop. Ever.  Until you are dead. 
Sarah slump in utter resignation. 
SARAH (quietly) Can you stop it? 
REESE (continuing) ...but there was one man...who taught us to fight.  To storm the wire of the camps.  To smash those metal mother- fuckers into junk.  He turned it around...he brought us back from the brink. (pause) His name is Connor.  John Connor... your son, Sarah.  Your unborn son. 
Sarah stared at him.

Reese and Terminator race along opposite sides of a row of cars, approaching the exit. The cruiser pulls ahead and closes diagonally as they clear the last car. Reese sees the other's shotgun leveled. He ducks, steering blind, keeps it floored. The windshield and side window EXPLODES INWARD. 
The Buick slams into the black-and-white, spinning it into a parked truck.  TIRES SCREAM as the two cars slew around heading for the exit. 
SEVERAL ANGLES, as the police react. 
The chopper banks tight and dives across the tops of the parked cars.  Cruisers race to converge.

LOW WIDE ANGLE, PRECEDING REESE'S BUICK as it hits the street, accelerating.  Terminator's cruiser slides out behind it, fishtails, races forward. Engines roar as the cars go flat out.  Buildings lining the street become a blur. The chopper arcs in behind them. Legitimate police, lights blazing, enter the pursuit one by one. 
LOW ANGLE, MOVING WITH TERMINATOR'S CAR as Reese dodges across all lanes ahead of it. Terminator gaining. They run an intersection at a hundred plus.

TIGHT ON REESE as the doorpost next to his shoulder is torn out by the other's blast. 
SILBERMAN And who was the enemy? 
REESE SKYNET.  A computer defense system built for SAC-NORAD by Cyber Dynamics.  A modified Series 
SILBERMAN (gravely) I see.  And this...computer, thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy, kill- ing him, in effect, before he is even conceived?  A sort of retroactive abortion? 
REESE Yes.

CUT TO: 
157     INT. INTERROGATION ROOM 
REESE ...it had no choice. The defensive grid was smashed. We'd taken the mainframes... We'd won.  Taking out Connor then would make no difference.  Skynet had to wipe out his entire exist- ence.  We captured the lab complex.  Found the...what- ever it was called...the time-displacement equipment. The Terminator had already gone through.  They sent two of us to intercept, then zeroed the whole place. Sumner didn't make it. 
SILBERMAN Then how are you supposed to get back? 
REESE Can't.  Nobody goes home. Nobody else comes through. It's just him and me. 
CUT TO: 
158     INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 
E.C.U. - TERMINATOR, in profile, showing his lacerated eye. He is close to a mirror, practically touching it, staring intently. 
MACRO - X-ACTO KNIFE lying on the dresser.  Terminator's fingers lift it.  CAMERA TILTS TO FOLLOW as it rises to his face, holds TIGHT ON left eye. With a smooth motion the knife point enters the eyeball and cuts away the ruins sclera and cornea, as well as part of the damaged eyelids. 
He wipes with a rag to clear the electronic eye's vision. Revealing the faintly glowing lens mechanism, suspended in a chrome socket by tiny servos. The eye whirs quietly as it tracks. 
SEQUENCE OF SHOTS, showing various repairs. Terminator's right hand, its wrist SUTURED crudely, holds a needle and sewing thread and starts to work on abdominal wound out of frame below. He slips a glove over the damaged hand. A motoring cap over the blistered scalp. 
A fresh shirt to hide his body wounds. This is followed by a new overcoat. 
C.U. - TERMINATOR, contemplating his reflection in the mirror.  With the hat pulled down, the collar pulled up, and favoring his right profile he looks unhurt...though a bit gaunt and pale. 
A turn of his head brings the balefully glowing left eye in its metal socket into view. He slips on a pair of tight, wrap-around sunglasses. 
FULL SHOT as he goes to the bed and flips up the stained mattress.  He picks up the Remington 12 gauge, the AR-180 and the .38 off the springs and leaves by the fire escape.

REESE (recorded) ...It's just him and me. 
CUT WIDE revealing Sarah, Silberman, Vukovich and Traxler watching a monitor sitting amid incredible paperwork clutter on a desk top. 
SILBERMAN (recorded) Why didn't you bring any weapons?  Something more advanced.  Don't you have ray guns? 
Traxler, standing in the back, grins and nudges Silberman, who nods appreciatively. 
TIGHT ON REESE'S RECORDED IMAGE - He glares at Silberman. 
ON SARAH, as Silberman's voice is heard. 
SILBERMAN (recorded) Show me a piece of future technology. 
REESE (recorded/con- trolling his hostility) You go naked.  Something about the field generated by a living organism.  Nothing dead will go. 
SILBERMAN (recorded) Why? 
REESE (recorded) I didn't build the fucking thing. 
SILBERMAN (recorded) Okay.  Okay.  But this... (consults his notes) cyborg...if it's metal... 
REESE (recorded) Surrounded by living tissue. 
SILBERMAN (recorded) Of course. 
The real Silberman put the tape on "PAUSE". 
SILBERMAN (excited) This is great stuff.  I could make a career out of this guy. You see how clever this part is...how it doesn't require a shred of proof.  Most paranoid delusions are intricate...but this is brilliant. 
He starts the tape again. 
SILBERMAN (recorded) Why were the other two women killed? 
REESE (recorded) Most official records were lost in the war.  The computer knew almost nothing about Connor's mother.  Her name. Where she lived, just the city. No scanner pictures.  The Terminator was just being systematic. 
C.U. - REESE, ON SCREEN, as he goes on. 
REESE (recorded, con- tinuing) You've heard enough.  Decide. Are you going to release me? 
SILBERMAN (recorded) I'm afraid that's not up to me. 
REESE (recorded/voice rising) Then why am I talking to you? Get out. 
ANGLE LOOKING OUT from the mouth of an enclosed concrete storm drain that passes under the road.  Reese, followed by Sarah, trudges down the slope and ducks inside. The floor is wet but he doesn't seem to mind. They both hunker down with their backs to the concrete, facing each other. They look beaten, grimy, exhausted. She huddles under the blanket, waif-like. 
REESE You cold? 
SARAH Freezing. 
REESE Come here. 
She sits beside him and they wrap their arms around each other with the blanket covering both of them. 
SARAH Reese...you got a first name? 
REESE Kyle. 
SARAH Kyle, what's it like when you go through time? 
REESE White light.  Pain.  Like being ripped inside out... slowly.  Like being born, maybe. 
Sarah scowls and draws her hand out from under his jacket. 
SARAH You're wet.  Oh my god. 
In the beam of the flashlight her hand is glistening with blood. 
REESE I caught one, back there. 
SARAH (incredulous) Caught one?  You mean you got shot? 
Reese shrugs. 
REESE It's not bad. 
Sarah sits up and turns toward him. 
SARAH We gotta get you to a doctor. 
REESE It's okay.  Forget it. 
SARAH Forget it?  Are you crazy? Let me see it. 
Sarah opens his jacket and the flashlight beam shows his shirt bloodsoaked at the shoulder. 
SARAH (continuing) Jeez.  You idiot.  Take this off. 
She cradles the flashlight between her knees and opens the first aid kit as he removes his jacket. 
REESE (looking at the wound) See.  Missed everything. Passed through the meat. 
Sarah starts swabbing the flesh wound. 
SARAH This is gonna make me puke. Talk about something. 
REESE What? 
SARAH Just talk.  Tell me about my son.  Is he tall? 
She places a gauze pad in place and starts to wrap it. 
REESE About my height.  He has your-- (winces) ...damn...he has your eyes. 
Sarah glances at his face for a second and then goes back to work. 
SARAH What's he like? 
REESE (thoughtful) You trust him.  He's got that strength.  You'd die in a second for John. 
SARAH Well, at least I know what to name him.  I don't suppose you'd know who the father is? So I don't tell him to get lost when I meet him. 
REESE John never said much about him.  He dies.  Even before the war... 
SARAH (interrupting) Stop!  I don't want to know. Hold still.  So...it was John that ordered you here? 
REESE I volunteered. 
SARAH You volunteered? 
REESE It was an honor.  A chance to meet the legend.  Sarah Connor.  Who taught her son to fight...organize, prepare. From when he was a kid.  When you were in hiding, before the war. 
She stops taping.  She seems lost, her bravado dissipated. 
SARAH You talk about things I haven't done yet in the past tense.  It's making me crazy.  I can't think. (pause) Are you sure you've got the right person? 
Reese appraises her coldly. 
REESE I'm sure. 
SARAH Come on, me? The mother of the future?  Am I tough? Organized?  I can't even balance my checkbook.  I cry when I see a cat that's been run over... and I don't even like cats. 
She pulls the bandage tight with a knot. 
REESE Ow!  No, it's okay.  It's better tight. 
SARAH And anyway, what do I know about guerrilla warfare? 
REESE You'll learn. 
SARAH (angry) Look, Reese, I didn't ask for this honor and I don't want it. Any of it. 
SARAH I was dreaming about dogs. 
Reese extricates himself from her and steps out of the culvert. 
REESE We used them to spot Terminators. 
Sarah groans as she straightens her legs. 
SARAH Your world...it's pretty terrifying.

Sarah catches up to him just as he is about to try and stop an approaching car.  She pulls his gun hand down with both of hers. 
SARAH Put that away.  I'll get one. 
She hold out her thumb to passing traffic. Reese watches this incomprehensible ceremony skeptically. 
SARAH (continuing) This works...really. 
CUT TO: 
189A    EXT. HIGHWAY/PICKUP - DAY                              189A 
Reese and Sarah are crammed into the cab of a beat-to-hell PICKUP TRUCK with the DRIVER, obviously a surfer.  Laid- back, long-haired and well-tanned. Reese glowers and watches the scenery through slitted eyes. 
DRIVER ...and when it breaks right off the point they get some pretty rad tubes up there. Not awesome, but I mean, worth the drive, if you're hardcore like me. 
REESE (to Sarah) Rad tubes? 
SARAH (to Reese) He's a surfer. 
DRIVER You from back East of something? 
SARAH No, he's from the future. 
DRIVER Whoah.  I hear that. (pause) Listen, I had a rough night.  I gotta stop and bag some Z's. 
They pull off the highway toward a gas station/rest area. 
CUT TO: 
190     EXT. SERVICE STATION - DAY                             190 
The gas station is like an oasis of clutter in a rolling stretch of meadows and woods.  It consists of a bunker- like building with restrooms and a flanking PICNIC AREA, beyond which are WOODS. People sit under the trees, enjoying the beautiful day while children tear around after the forced inactivity of a long trip. 
The three of them get out on unsteady legs. 
DRIVER You can still ride if you wanna hang out for a couple hours. 
SARAH Thanks. 
REESE Bag some Z's? 
SARAH Let's get cleaned up, Kyle. 
She heads for the WOMEN'S RESTROOM and Kyle follows her inside. 
REESE (pushing him out) Yours is over there. 
Instead of following her directions to the Men's Room, Kyle wanders toward the drinking fountain.  A bunch of kids are running around and throwing water at each other with paper cups. 
Reese shambles through them like a zombie. He stands among the children, an alien in this land without fear.  He watches people at picnic tables laughing and listening to portable music.  Kids squeal.  Dogs bark. 
LITTLE GIRL (V.O.) Can you get my balloon? 
DOWN ANGLE on an achingly beautiful LITTLE GIRL of about four.  She points above his head. 
Reese looks up to see a helium-filled mylar balloon stuck in the foliage of a tree just above him.  He pulls it down by the string and holds it, turning it over dully. 
He crouches down to her eye-level.  She smiles. 
REESE Aren't you afraid to be out in the open like this? 
LITTLE GIRL Huh? 
Reese whirls reflexively at a SCREAM behind him.  The mylar balloon bursts in his tense hands.  A teenage girl is being doused with water by the boys with plastic jugs. 
The little girl looks at the broken balloon, then glares at Reese.  She punches him soundly on the shoulder and storms off. 
At this moment she is bowled over by an IRISH SETTER that licks her face while she shrieks with laughter. Reese seems about to smile but doesn't quite know how to go about it.

Sarah is talking on an open pay phone. 
SARAH ...I know, Mom.  This is the soonest I could...I know. Mom...Mom, I can't talk long. No, I'm okay. (pause) I was on TV?  Really? (pause) Oh no, I hate that picture... why didn't you give them my graduation picture? (pause) I'm okay, really.  Listen, I want you to pack some stuff and go up to the cabin for a few days.  Just don't...no, don't ask any questions. Just do it.  I gotta get going...gotta go.  Bye, bye. 
Sarah has been idly leafing through the DIRECTORY.  On a whim she looks up something. She freezes for a moment when she finds the listing. Then with a triumphant expression she rips the page out of the book. CUT TO: 
192     EXT. SERVICE STATION/PICNIC TABLE - DAY                192 
Sarah is sitting at a table under a tree, lettering something with a lipstick on a cardboard box-flap. 
REESE (a whisper) I'm wrong here.  I wasn't meant to see this... 
He gestures at their surroundings. 
REESE (continuing) It's...like some dream. This...this... 
He touches the grass, the trunk of a tree. 
REESE (continuing) ...and you...all so...beauti- ful.  It hurts, Sarah.  More than death. 
He looks are her beseechingly. 
REESE (continuing) Don't you understand...it's all gone! 
Sarah puts her arm around him. She sniffs and wipes at her nose with the back of her hand. 
SARAH We can change it, Kyle.  We have to try. 
She takes his shoulder in her hands. 
SARAH (continuing) There's no fate but what we make for ourselves. Right? Come on.  Let's go, kiddo. Whaddya say? 
He picks up her sign and they look at each other for a second, then get up.

MEDIUM ON TERMINATOR 
sitting on the edge of the bed. His appearance isn't improving. 
A patch of SCALP is blown away, revealing CHROME underneath. A flap of skin dangles from his cheek, which exposes some of the DRIVE CABLES which move the lips. He is scanning Sarah's address book, turning a page every two seconds.

The two fugitives walk toward an economy motel of the two-story park-by-the-door variety. Sarah turns to wave as a TRACTOR-TRAILER pulls away noisily, heading back to the Interstate.  The driver answers her wave out the side window.  Reese stops for a moment outside the motel office to pet a GERMAN SHEPHERD sitting on the porch. The dog wags its tail and licks his hand. 
Reese opens the door and they go in.

210     INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT                                210 
A heartwarming domestic scene. Sarah and Kyle have pulled the dresser out to use as a worktable.  Pans, packages and bottles clutter the kitchen, B.G.  On the table between them are eight ten-inch lengths of PLUMBER'S PIPE, threaded each end.  Kyle is showing Sarah how to tamp the HIGH-EXPLOSIVE PUTTY into the pipe bombs and seal them shut. 
REESE Make sure there's none on the threads, like this.  Now screw the end-cap on...very gently. 
SARAH You must have had a fun child- hood. 
REESE That's good.  Now, seven more like that while I make fuses. 
SARAH I was thinking, there's so much I've got to show you when we get through this. It's mind boggling, the pos- sibilities...Disneyland, the beach, movies...matinees with popcorn and foot-long hot dogs... 
REESE Hot dogs? 
SARAH I want to buy you a hot dog so bad,Kyle...all the things you've never seen and done.  You're here, but wherever you go, and whatever you touch, you bring the war with you. 
REESE My whole life has been combat. 
SARAH I want it to be over for you. 
REESE Not possible. 
SARAH I want it to be over for me too. I feel like I slipped over some invisible line, that I'm in your world now.  Everything's the same, but I see it differently. It's like, there's you and me, and him...but nobody else can understand or help or even touch us. 
Reese looks up and finally catches her gaze.  He reaches out for her hand and it seems he may be taking it to comfort her. But he turns her wrist to read her watch. 
REESE We'll head out at 0200. That gives you four hours to sleep if you want.  I'll finish.

ANGLE ON TABLE - The bombs are neatly ranked, finished. A nylon satchel lies nearby.  The mess is cleaned up. 
WIDE SHOT reveals Reese sitting in silent vigil at the window.  The room is dark, lit only by a streetlight outside. Sarah is asleep on the bed. 
Reese sits cross-legged, shirtless, his body held rigid. The image of discipline.  The .357 is held loosely in one hand on his lap.  There is a fresh bandage on his shoulder. 
Sarah wakes up and goes to him in the darkness.  He looks at her for a moment as she sits beside him, then back outside. 
SARAH He'll find us, won't he? 
REESE Probably.  Sarah, if I get zeroed... 
SARAH Don't say that. 
REESE If I do, you have to get away, disappear without a trace. Different country, different name, everything.  In case they send another one. 
SARAH It'll never be over, will it? Look at me, I'm shaking. Some legend, huh?  You must be pretty disappointed. 
REESE No.  I'm not. 
Several beats before Sarah speaks again.  Her eyes seem luminous in the dark. 
SARAH (softly) Kyle, the women in your time...what were they like? 
REESE Good fighters. 
SARAH That's not what I meant. Was there someone special? 
REESE Someone? 
SARAH A girl.  You know. 
REESE (mechanically) No. (pause) Never. 
He looks away, outside the window 
SARAH (softly) I'm sorry. 
Sarah studies him for a moment. She's sitting slightly behind him and she puts her hands on his shoulders and back, tracing the lines of his scars with her fingertips. 
SARAH So much pain. 
REESE Pain can be controlled. You disconnect it. 
SARAH And so you feel nothing. 
REESE It's better that way. 
SARAH (with great sympathy) Oh, Kyle. 
DETAIL - PIPE CHARGE, lying just inside the door, in the shadows.  The fuse is burning.

They enter an interchange.  Ahead lies a LONG, SWEEPING CURVE, two lanes wide and elevated.

From the railing Sarah sees the tanker below as 
a body falls beside it, rolling. The truck swings in a slow arc. TEARS THROUGH THE DIVIDING FENCE. Heads back toward her on the wrong side of the freeway. 
She stares in numb horror. The nightmare refuses to end. She runs to the crippled pickup and sees a front tire flat, shredded by a crumpled fender. 
She searches the cab frantically for the KEYS TO THE MOTORCYCLES.  Finds them above the sun visor. 
Sarah leaps into the bed of the pickup and attacks the motorcycle strap-downs frantically. Panting with terror she rolls the bike off the truck. It crashes on its side and she falls on it painfully. 
Straining until she CRIES OUT INVOLUNTARILY, she lifts it upright. KICKS the engine over. 
LOW ANGLE 
as the tanker crashes back through the divider and starts UP THE OVERPASS.  Sarah is trapped in that concrete corridor. She kicks for her life. The bike catches for a moment.  Dies. 
The truck BELLOWS, down-shifting on the curving grade. Sarah kicks again and again, crying out with each stroke. Again and again, furiously. The engine CATCHES. 
SARAH (rapidly) Come on, come on, come on ...run, you... 
The bike runs with a healthy roar. 
LOW ANGLE

The trailers force her closer and closer  to the guardrail as Terminator tries to sandwich her. The bike slides to a stop. The rearmost set of trailer wheels slams into the guardrail right in front of Sarah. 
Sarah emerges from a cloud of tire smoke, cutting across all four lances behind the stopped semi.

Kyle slides the bolts on the metal firedoor.  Behind them are acres of machinery in darkness.  Silence. CRASH!  The Terminator hits the door from the far side. Hinges SQUEAL. 
Kyle goes to a LARGE BREAKER PANEL and opens it.  Starts throwing switches.  Behind them, machines START UP ONE BY ONE. 
SARAH (panting) What are you doing? 
REESE (weakly) Cover...our footsteps... 
He sags, sliding down the wall.  She pulls him up. Half-carries him into the maze of machines. The dark gallery is filled with WHIRRING, CLANKING SHAPES, SHATTERING CONVEYER BELTS and improbable mechanisms lashing mindlessly. 
Reese slips to the floor and Sarah is no longer able to support him. 
REESE (faintly) Leave me here. 
Sarah crouches beside him. Grabs his shirt front. Yells over the machines. 
SARAH I'm not leaving you anywhere you jerk.  Haven't you figured it out?  Kyle, John is our son. 
Reese's eyes refocus. 
SARAH (continuing) There isn't going to be anybody else...I don't want anybody else.  Listen to me! 
She pauses, then resumes in a commanding, military shout. 
SARAH (continuing) Move!  Reese! Let's go. Move you ass! 
She drags him to his feet and he staggers on. 
Hinges SHATTER and the firedoor is hurled inward. The Terminator scans the darkness. 
ANGLE - PANNING WITH SARAH AND KYLE as they move through the machines. 
The cyborg steps forward, scanning methodically. 
Sarah and Kyle move in a crouch through the treacherous tangle of pipes and machinery.  Kyle picks up a length of pipe to use as a weapon.  As they climb out onto a cat- walk between the two huge mechanisms, Sarah clambers over an innocuous CONTROL PANEL. Her knee inadvertently hits a RED PUSH BUTTON. With a ROAR the stamping-plate of a HYDRAULIC PRESS slams down an inch from her hand. Startled, she tumbles to the catwalk. 
The Terminator's eyes swivel as he hears the single non- rhythmic sound. 
Kyle and Sarah run to the end of the catwalk, but find the door there locked. 
SARAH Come on! 
They double back to escape the cul-de-sac.  The Terminator steps in front of them, cutting them off. 
REESE (shouting) Run! 
He pushes Sarah roughly and she stumbles away. Kyle raises the pipe with his good arm as the Terminator advances. 
REESE (over his shoulder) Run, damn it! 
She hesitates, backing away. The cyborg swings at Reese STEEL CLANGS ON STEEL. Kyle strikes and parries but is sledgehammered back. 
ANGLE ON CATWALK as Kyle lands in a heap, smashed against a stanchion of the railing which prevented him falling to the factory floor twenty feet below. 
Sarah turns and runs. 
LOW ANGLE PAST REESE, F.G., as the cyborg approaches him. 
E.C.U. - A FUSE BURNING. 
C.U. - KYLE'S FACE streaked with blood, pressed to the floor as a metal foot CLANGS DOWN, F.G.   His eyes snap open. 
Sarah falls, gets up, runs on. The Terminator draws back for a death blow. And Kyle rolls with the last of his strength, raising the pipe bomb he has been cradling.  He jams it between two hydraulic cylinders just beneath the cyborg's armored  rib- cage.  Then rolls off the catwalk.  Terminator has an instant to react, reaching for the bomb, before it EXPLODES. 
Sarah is pitched forward by the blast and slides on the floor. Slams up against one wall. A withering spray of shrapnel strafes the walls around her. Pieces of scrap metal clatter throughout the factory, rain- ing down. 
C.U. - SARAH, very still.  She winces and opens her eyes. Slowly looks up. 
POV - SARAH, as the smoke clears.  The Terminator is GONE. Unrecognizable clumps of BURNING DEBRIS lie scattered about. Looking down through the grating floor she sees Kyle's body. LOW ANGLE ON KYLE F.G., Sarah on catwalk above.  Kyle's eyes are half-open.  Still.  His face peaceful. ANGLE ON ONE OF THE FIRES climbing some plastic tubing and triggering a SPRINKLER HEAD.  It begins to rain. C.U. - SARAH sitting up as the water runs over her. She looks down.  Protruding from her right thigh is a TWISTED PIECE OF METAL.  Shrapnel.  Part of the cyborg.  She pulls it out, grimacing.  Her leg is broken. 
It is a long time before she can gather the will to move. 
SARAH'S POV - She sees a WALL PHONE several yards away, beyond the debris from the explosion. She starts to crawl toward it. She passes A LARGE CLUMP OF DEBRIS, F.G.

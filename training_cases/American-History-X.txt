INT. BRIEFING ROOM - A MEETING 
Cops and detectives sit attentively and a few sip coffee. The clock on the wall above reads 7:38 AM. Middle-aged with slicked-back hair, CAPTAIN JOHN RASMUSSEN finishes a thought. He spots Sweeney as he enters and aimlessly reaches for a file. 
RASMUSSEN All right. Moving on-- (acknowledging) Good Morning, Doctor. 
The group looks over and meets Sweeney's hard glare. 
SWEENEY Good morning. 
RASMUSSEN Gentlemen, this is Dr. Bob Sweeney. He's Principal over at Venice High and for some time now he's done a load of outreach work with gangs...in and out of the can. 
Sweeney nods as Rasmussen cough.  He sips water and continues. 
RASMUSSEN Three years ago a local kid named Derek Vinyard gets sent up for murdering a couple of Crips who were trying to jack his car. Bob taught Vinyard back in high school and has followed the case closely. 
YOUNG COP He was a skinhead, right? 
SWEENEY Derek was more like...the skinhead. He and Cameron Alexander. 
COP #2 
Who? 
Rasmussen opens a FILE in front of him. There rests Derek's mug shot. He flips it over and reveals CAMMERON'S MUG SHOT. Front and side view. 
RASMUSSEN Cammeron Alexander is probably the biggest writer and distributor of white power literature in LA County. He promotes white power bands, writes reviews, columns, all at the ripe age of forty. 
YOUNG COP (smiling) He's forty? Jesus. 
RASMUSSEN Pretty clean record...runs everything out of his house down by the beach. 
SWEENEY There weren't any organized white gangs around Venice before those two hooked up. Very few, if any. It was mostly just black and Mexican. But it was tiny. They hit it off though... and Alexander hit the jackpot with Derek. 
Rasmussen reaches over and pushes play on a VCR. 
RASMUSSEN We got some uncut footage here. Courtesy of NBC. 
ON THE TELEVISION-- 
REPORTER Earlier this evening...LA County Firefighter Dennis Vinyard was shot and killed while putting out a fire in a suspected Compton drug den. 
RASMUSSEN (to the group) This being February of '90. 
EXT. VINYARD HOUSEHOLD - A LIVE BROADCAST - VIDEOTAPE 
A YOUNGER DEREK, short haired with no tattoos, stands next to the reporter. Derek wears a Venice High Basketball jersey drenched in sweat. Towel around neck, he thinks to himself as the man speaks into the camera. 
REPORTER To my right I have Lieutenant Vinyard's oldest son Derek. (to Derek) How do you feel about all this, son? 
DEREK How do I feel? How do you think I feel? It's typical. 
REPORTER Typical how, Derek? 
DEREK Well...look at our country. It's a haven for criminals. Black...brown... yellow...whatever. 
REPORTER So you're saying the murder of your father is "race" related? 
DEREK Every problem in this country is "race" related. Every problem, not just crime. These problems are rooted in the black community, the Hispanic community, the Asian...every non- Protestant group in our society. (then) Look at the shit. Immigration... welfare...AIDS...they're all the problems of the non-white. Look at the statistics. 
REPORTER Most of these issues you're referring to though son are related to-- 
DEREK (interrupting) No no no! Don't say poverty right now cause that's not it. They're not a product of our fucking environment either! Minorities don't give two shits about this country! They're here to exploit...not embrace. 
RASMUSSEN (O.S) (over reporter's question) When Alexander got his hands on this segment...he copied it, sent it out and it became the Gettysberg Address for hate groups across the country. 
BACK TO THE TELEVISION. 
DEREK Millions of white Europeans came to this country and flourished within a generation! A generation! So what the fuck is wrong with these people?! 
REPORTER What does any of this have to do with your father? 
DEREK Because my father was doing his fucking job! Saving a nigger neighborhood he didn't give two shits about! And he got killed by some drug dealer who still collects a fucking welfare check. 
Derek looks at the man and walks over to HIS MOTHER DORIS, who smokes a cigarette. The camera follows him as he puts his arm around her and escorts her back inside their Venice Beach residence. The camera pans back to the reporter who just stands there, speechless. 
INT. BRIEFING ROOM - SAME 
Rasmussen ejects the tape, the screen turns to fuzz, and he turns it off. 
CHRIS I don't care. I just wanna get wet. 
TIGHT ON DANNY. He flips through a book titled TURNER DIARIES. On the nightstand to his left is a digital clock that reads 4:47 p.m. 
DANNY I've been trying to buy this.  You can't find it anywhere. 
The two look at Dan. 
JASON Cammeron dropped us off a copy. Dope fucking shit, man. It's all about reclaiming the country. I'll let you read it when I'm done. 
DANNY Fuck that. I just read Mein Kampf. 
JASON There you go. 
CHRIS Hey? What was this Daryl shit you were talking about? 
DANNY Henry Hastings almost kicked Daryl Dawson's ass. He would're too if-- 
CHRIS Little Henry the negroid? 
Danny nods. 
DANNY Everyday there's something over there, man. 
CHRIS Why do you think we fuckin' quit? 
DANNY I hear you. 
JASON Daryl Dawson's a pussy faggot. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. BOARDWALK - DANNY, JASON AND CMRIS - LATER 
The three skateboard down the strand, Jason and Chris with their surfboardS and suits. Chris looks at Jason's shirt. 
CHRIS What's ZOG again? 
JASON Zionist somethin'. 
DANNY Zionist-Occupational-Government. 
Ahead an OLD ASIAN WOMAN tows a succession of SHOPPING CARTS. As Jason passes, he smacks her with his surfboard and knocks her to the ground. They all laugh and Danny breaks off and heads east on Rose. 
CUT TO: 
INT. DUMPY APARTMENT - TIGHT ON TEARY EYES 
DAVINA VINYARD, in a UCLA T-SHIRT and panties, cries on the couch as she hugs a LONG HAIRED Derek. DORIS sobs as she lays under a pink blanket, burdened by the flu. Shirtless Derek grabs Doris' hand and leans over to kiss her. 
DEREK It's gonna be fine. 
EXT. DUMPY APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT 
Danny skates up to his residence and looks at a car across the street. Two plainclothes cops from the earlier meeting sit in their car and stare from afar. Danny goes through the gate. 
iNT. HOUSE- SAME 
Danny walks in on the tearful family conclave.  He stands there, wishing the day would just end. 
DANNY Oh man--! Come on!  What are you crying about now? 
THE PHONE RINGS and Derek rushes down the hall to get it. 
DEREK I got it. 
Danny looks to his mother. 
DANNY Are you feeling better at all? 
DORIS I need a kiss. 
Danny wipes away her tears, kisses her, and moves away quickly so he won't get sick. 
INT. BEDROOM - DEREK ON THE PHONE 
He listens to the man on the other line. 
DEREK Unhuh. Unhuh. Did you expel him? 
INT. BATHROOM - TIGHT ON SETH 
He points his Glock 9mm at the mirror. 
SETH Drop the t.v., nigger. 
He laughs to himself and exits. 
INT. HALLWAY - SETH CONTINUED 
He bangs on Derek's door once more, pissed that Derek didn't open it earlier. He heads for the living room. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUE TV ACTION 
Danny, Davina, and Doris are glued to the news story on the same station. Doris, once beautiful, is now aged and graying. NYQUIL, PEPTO BISMOL, two PRESCRIPTION CONTAINERS, and a spoon rest on the coffee table. 
TIGHT ON THE TELEVISION. A WELL-DRESSED BLACK WOMAN speaks angrily to the reporter covering the story. Random black protestors nod and comment in the background. 
BLACK WOMAN Maybe now whites will understand the motives behind people like Malcolm X and the Black Panthers.  Just put the shoe on the other foot. 
FLASH TO: 
EXT. CHINO PRISON - THE VINYARDS ON NEWS FOOTAGE 
Danny walks' towards Derek and they smile and hug.  Davina and Doris soon join in. 
Davina 
BLACK WOMAN (V/O) Derek Vinyard deserved the death penalty for what he did to that young man! And now he walks the street as free as you and I. 
DANNY {to the tv) What about OJ, bitch!? 
INT. VINYARD HOUSE - TIGHT ON THE TV 
The news segment winds down. 
BLACK WOMAN (fed up, to the camera) They've done it to us again. 
A hand reaches over to turn the channel. IT'S SETH. Doris, in an awful state, lays back down. 
TIGHT ON SETH. Tattoos cover his forearms. A BLOODY SNAKE is halfway tucked under his rolled-up sleeves. 
SETH Nigger lovin' Jew media calling the shots. Watch cartoons. It's the only t.v. that's safe nowadays. 
DORIS No one's safe--until we all are. 
Seth looks at the woman like she's from another planet. He laughs and goes into the kitchen. 
INT. KITCHEN - SETH'S POV 
He looks through the fridge but finds nothing. He closes the door and looks at the family pictures on the door. 
A FAMILY SHOT of Doris, Derek, Danny, Davina, and DENNIS VINYARD in front of church. Seth appreciates Dennis in a coat and tie. Below that, a picture of a dirty and rugged Dennis and a young Davina, wearing her father's FIRE HELMET. Danny with Doris. 
SETH Come in here, Dan. 
INT. SMALL KITCHEN - SAME 
He sits and comes upon Davina's revealing CROTCH. She studies and so does he. Danny walks in the kitchen and looks through the fridge. He pulls out a leftover piece of steak and gnaws on it. Seth looks over at Dan 
SETH Where the fuck you find that? 
DANNY Goin' to Cam's party tonight? 
SETH Is Davina's ass water tight? 
Danny laughs. 
DAVINA Hurry up and leave, Goodyear.  You've taken your dump now go. 
SETH Listen to you. You callin' me a blimp, you fuckin' Democrat?! 
DAVINA Yes! I am! 
Danny takes a bite and laughs at Seth. 
DANNY I'm there tonight. 
SETH Oh yeah? You ask Derek? 
DANNY I don't know.  I feel threatened by them. 
DAVINA They feel threatened by you! 
SETH (ignoring her) What else, Danny? And speak intelligently you little queer faggot. 
Davina's attention is rapt on her little brother. 
DANNY I hate the fact that it's cool to be black these days. 
SETH Good. DANNY I hate this hip hop influence on white fuckin' suburbia. 
SETH 
Good! 
DANNY I hate Hilary Clinton and all of her Zionist MTV pigs telling us we should get along. Save the rhetorical bullshit honey, it ain't gonna happen. 
Seth looks at the young man.  He smiles at him with distinct revelation. 
SETH That's the best shit I've ever heard come out of that mouth. 
TIGHT ON DAVINA. She stares at the two hate mongers. 
DAVINA I feel.sorry for you, Danny. 
SETH Shut up, Davina. 
DAVINA You shut up, you poison to fuckin' society! Get out of our house! 
SETH (laughing) Is this any way to treat a guest? 
DAVINA Derek hates you, Seth. 
DEREK (O.S.) How do you know who I hate, Davina? 
TIGHT ON DEREM VINYARD - SILENCE. 
He's a striking presence with his scruff, tight t-shirt and tats hanging down his arm. A black jacket wraps around his waist. 
DAVINA (O.S) What do you mean? 
Seth stands and smiles. 
SETH Hey! How are you, man? Fuckin' A. Long time no see. Look at that hair. 
Seth moves to hug his old friend but Derek offers a reluctant hand instead. 
DEREK Gimme just one second, okay? 
Seth nods as Derek stares at Danny. 
DEREK Did you do a book report on Mein Kampf? 
DANNY What's it to you? 
DEREK (ready to kill) What's it to me? 
DANNY (seeing this) I mean...how'd you find out? 
DEREK None of your fucking business how I found out. 
SETH I thought it was a great idea. 
DEREK That figures.  You're more stupid than he is. 
SETH It's nice to see you too, man. 
DEREK Why'd you do it, Dan?  Because of Seth. 
DANNY No. 
DEREK Cammeron? 
DANNY I did it cause I felt like it. 
DEREK Oh, you do everything you feel like? I feel like smacking you in the fucking head. Would you mind if I did a report on that? 
DANNY Uhhh...yeah. 
DEREK I'll see ya. 
DORIS Okay. Be careful. 
DEREK 
I will. 
Derek follows Seth out the SIDE WINDOW and goes down the alley. 
INT. APARTMENT - TIGHT ON DORIS 
She thinks to herself and closes her eyes. 
EXT. SIDE STREET - SETH'S TRUCK 
Derek looks at the oblivious cops and drops into the passenger's seat. Seth starts the engine and drives away. As the truck disappears, we pick up on a WHITE SOUPED UP JEEP CHEROKEE turning the corner. Tinted windows, it cruises past the apartment complex. 
INT. DANNY'S BEDROOM - A DESK 
CUT TO: 
Danny's attention is everywhere except on his homework. 
DANNY This sucks. 
He walks back out of his bedroom. 
INT. HALLWAY/LIVING ROOM - DANNY'S POV 
He watches Davina complete her homework on the couch. Doris, on the sofa opposite, tries to sleep. 
DANNY Hey. 
DAVINA Hey what? 
DANNY Come here. 
DAVINA 
What!? 
DANNY Come here for a second! 
The scholar sets her homework aside and impatiently follows him down the hall. 
INT. BEDROOM - TWO SINGLE BEDS 
She sits on the edge of DANNY'S bed.  Danny hands her his assignment instructions. 
DAVINA I got shit to do, Dan. 
DANNY Just read it. 
She sighs and begins to read it out loud. 
DAVINA "American History X? Take home paper as assigned by Principal Robert Sweeney?" (to Danny) Why is he giving you homework? What happened to Murray? 
DANNY Asshole turned me in. 
DAVINA Why? 
DANNY Just read. 
DAVINA "Describe in detail your opinion of -the historical event that took place in the early morning of October 4th, 1993." What's that? 
DANNY The night Derek wasted those guys. 
Davina takes a moment. 
DAVINA Sweeney gave you this? 
DANNY 
Yep. 
DAVINA (continuing her reading) "Before and after...how has this event helped or hurt your present perspective concerning life in contemporary America. Use the standard five paragraph format, blab blab blah--this'll be good for you.. 
DANNY Nooo...it'll be good for you. 
DEREK Are you ready to do something about it? 
ET AL Yeah. 
DEREK Okay then. 
AND THEY'RE MOVING.  In formation.  Fast.  Directly at us.    Angry. 
As the camera swings into line, TRACKING WITH THEM, Derek reaches into his back pocket and pulls out a STOCKING MASK. He pulls it down over his face. 
The foot soldiers follow him in unison. 
DEREK (back to his troops) Remember. No names. Danny?  Stay right on my fucking ass, man. 
And now they're getting ahead of us. As the CAMERA SWINGS behind them, we see their destination. 
EXT. LIGHTED GROCERY STORE - SAME 
They storm the front entrance. The few people who are in there scream and scramble for cover. Derek grabs a Mexican boxboy and throws him to the ground. Seth catches up to another and gets him on the ground. 
SETH Wheto's your fucking green card, asshole? 
Seth kicks the young man in the face with a blatant shot and continues. DEREK leaves a terrified white woman alone like she's not even there and pushes over an adjacent shelf, knocking over another worker with CANS OF BEANS. 
DEREK (referring to the border) Can't hide from me, motherfucker! 
He kicks the man and looks around the market for more. Danny watches in awe. Curtis breaks a giant jelly jar over a head. Another skin throws a BLACK CHECKER into a shelf of POTATO CHIPS. 
DEREK'S POV. He looks up at one of the aisle mirrors. 
INT. BACK STOCK AREA - THE 55-YEAR-OLD KOREAN OWNER 
He rushes out with a pistol. He takes aim on Curtis and-- FROM OUT OF NOWHERE, DEREK TAKES A MOP TO THE OWNER'S HEAD AND PROCEEDS TO KICK HIM. Danny looks at Derek like he's Superman. 
Derek looks to his watch and straightens up. 
DEREK Let's go! We're outta here!  Move ! 
From just inside the door we see skins get in their last blows and pour out the aisles and pass us through the doors. TIRES SCREECH. THE CAMERA HOLDS ON THE WRECKAGE OF THE MARKET AND THE MOTIONLESS BODIES ON THE FLOOR; 
INT. BRONCO - TIGHT ON DANNY 
He takes off his stocking mask and stares at his stone- faced brother. 
DANNY (V/O) And before Derek could even blink...he had a crazed army behind him. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BEDROOM - PRESENT - THE COMPUTER 
Danny sparks up a cigarette and types on the screen. 
DANNY (V/O) Willing to follow his word like it was the word of God. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. VENICE BEACH HOUSE - A RAINY NIGHT - FLASHBACK 
As the rain falls, we see the Vinyards sitting at the table. Stacey and Murray Rosenberg, Doris' then boyfriend who we met earlier, round out the clan. Stacey sits close to Derek. 
DANNY (V/O) And then came October 4th, 1993. 
INT. BEACH HOUSE - THE DINING ROOM 
Doris looks wonderful while Murray, mustache and beard, shakes his head at Derek as he chatters away. 
DANNY (V/O) Things were fine on the homefront. My Mom had a good job but a below average boyfriend. We had a four-bedroom house that Dad left us with. Everyone was happy. 
TIGHT ON DEREK. Shaved head, rolled-up sleeves, tattoos, loosened tie, LA COPY CENTER name tag from earlier. His charisma draws their attention as he rambles over the crackling rainfall. 
DANNY (V/O) Everyone but Derek. 
DEREK Fuck you, Murray. White men don't cruise the streets of LA killing each other. 
MURRAY No.  You guys make bombs. 
Derek stares at the man, eyes filled with homicide. 
DEREK You're so fucking lame. A couple of cranks in cabins in Montana is not statistically significant. (then) White Americans don't take PCP and drink and drive a hundred and twenty fuckin' miles an hour! We pull over and trust the law. 
DEREK (to Murray) See! See the way she speaks! Tell me you're gonna shut up and I'll let go. 
DORIS Derek!  Let go of her hair and sit down! 
DEREK I will when I hear an answer, Doris. Are you going to shut up, Davina? 
TIGHT ON DANNY. He gets up quickly and tries to pull Derek off. Derek turns and cracks Danny in the face with a BACKHAND, dropping him back into a cabinet. A crystal vase with flowers crashes to the floor, just missing Danny's head. 
MURRAY 
Jesus! 
DEREK (to Danny) What are  you thinkin'? 
DORIS Danny?!  Are you okay?! 
Danny nods his head as everyone looks at Derek. 
DEREK It's a real easy question, Davina. A simple yes or no will suffice. Tell me what I want to hear and I'll let go. 
DAVINA Fuck...you. 
Derek takes a piece of roast beef off her plate and shoves it in her mouth. Me holds the whole piece inside so she can't spit it out. Davina cries as she chokes on the meat. 
MURRAY She can't breathe, Derek! 
DEREK Stay back, both of you!  It's her bed, she's gotta lie in it. (grabbing harder) You can cry all you want, Davina. I'm not gonna let go until you tell me what I wanna hear! Are you going to shut that fat fucking mouth of your's and let my girlfriend tell her opinion? Are you?! 
DORIS grabs him from behind and he aggressively turns on her. Derek curls his tongue behind his teeth and raises his arm like he's actually going to smack his mother. She grabs his arm though, forcefully. 
DORIS Let go of her hair and get out. 
Derek releases his grip on his sister and she spits the roast beef onto the floor. She runs into the back bedroom crying, choking and coughing. 
DAVINA (O.S) I hate you, you fucking asshole! 
The door slams shut in the background.  Doris, Murray, Danny, and Stacey all stare at Derek.  Derek calmly faces his brother. 
DEREK You okay? 
Danny nods. 
MURRAY (softly) Psycho. 
IN SLO MO--Time FREEZES as Derek slowly turns his head back to Murray. ON THE TRACK we hear a few keys being typed and then silence. A cigarette sizzles. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BEDROOM - DANNY THINKING - PRESENT 
He takes a long drag off his cigarette and exhales. He slowly runs his hands over his stubbly head, marveling at the past. 
BACK QUICKLY TO: 
INT. DINING ROOM - TIGHT ON DEREK - FLASHBACK CONT. 
Derek smiles at Murray in wonder and disbelief. 
DEREK Would you care to repeat that, Murray? I'm not sure I got all of it. 
STACEY (smiling) He called you a "psycho", honey. 
DEREK (smiling back) Was that it?    Thanks Murray. 
MURRAY See. Here we go again with this, Derek. Making me out to be the bad guy again. 
STACEY You callin' me a liar, RosenKike? 
MURRAY (to Stacey) Hey goddammit! You talk to me with respect or--! 
DEREK Or what, Murray!? What're you gonna do? Give her fucking detention? 
DORIS Both of you get out right now. 
Murray stares at Derek with pity.  Doris becomes emotional. 
DORIS (to Derek) Do you think you're the only one who's affected around here? 
Derek focuses on his mother for a moment. A captivated Danny watches and waits as Derek turns to Murray. 
DAVINA You couldn't tell. 
A RAINSOAKED DORIS walks through the front door. 
DORIS Find an apartment because I want you out of here. 
DEREK Morn, I'm sorry but that guy's-- 
DORIS I don't wanna hear it anymore!  I want you out! 
STACEY He can move in with me. 
DORIS When? 
STACEY Tomorrow. 
DORIS Good. 
She walks past Derek and into the back bedroom. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. BEDROOM - TIGHT ON DANNY'S EYES - PRESENT 
He rises from the computer and PEEKS out the blinds. The two cops supposedly watching Derek are now eating in the car. One of them looks up. Danny flips the blinds down. From the other room, he hears Doris break into another coughing fit. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - DANNY 
He sits beside her and hands her a glass of water. 
DANNY Here. 
DORIS Thank you, honey. 
She coughs, recovers, and sips. Danny walks away. 
DORIS Hey. Come here.  Sit with me. 
DANNY I've got this thing to do. 
DORIS You can sit down for two seconds. 
He looks at her and sits beside her. 
DANNY Don't breathe on me. 
DORIS I won't. 
They share a smile. 
DANNY It's cold in here, no wonder your sick. 
She stares and smiles at him for a few moments. 
DANNY What? 
DORIS What? I'm not allowed to look at you anymore? 
He smothers her face with his hand, jokingly. 
DANNY No. You're not. 
DORIS (laughing) Daniel Patrick! Stop it! Are you ever gonna let that beautiful hair grow back? 
DANNY Nope. Never. 
DORIS I bet you will. 
He smiles and locks eyes with his mother for several moments. He finally rises and walks back to his room. 
DANNY Get some sleep. 
DORIS If you need me to proof anything for you I will. 
DANNY I'll be all right. 
DORIS Wake up early if you get tired. 
Doris watches him disappear down the hall, distant thoughts creeping back slowly. 
CUT TO: 
OMIT 
INT. BEDROOM - DANNY'S EYES 
They clearly focus on the computer. HIGHLIGHTED is the sentence "There might have been if I testified." Only when he hits the DELETE KEY does it disappear. He continues typing. 
DANNY (V/O) (continuing) Over the next year we'd lose our house and the rest of our father's pension to attorney fees. My mother...much to all of our surprise...stood by Derek. 
Danny's interrupted by a LOUD KNOCK on the front door. 
INT. FRONT HALL - DANNY'S POV 
He looks through the PEEPHOLE and sees it's CHRIS AND JASON. He sighs in relief and opens the door. 
JASON We're here, dude. 
CHRIS Drop your dick and grab your stick. 
DANNY I told you I can't tonight. 
DORIS (O.S.) (from the couch) Danny? 
DANNY It's okay, Mom. 
The two punks laugh as Danny pushes them and their boards back to his bedroom.  He shuts his bedroom door. 
INT. BEDROOM - THE THREESOME 
Danny looks at the two. 
DANNY If I don't finish this thing I'm dead. 
CHRIS Just tell 'em you'll do it tomorrow. You can't miss the party. 
JASON Fire pie Lizzy called and told us to grab your ass. 
DANNY She did? 
CHRIS (nodding) You gotta hit that shit.  It's the only fun thing that's legal anymore. 
The PHONE RINGS and Danny grabs it. 
DANNY Hello? 
INT.  DARK OFFICE - TIGHT ON SWEENEY 
The only illumination shines through the window from the street.  Holding his briefcase, he stands over his desk phone, all packed up and almost out the door. 
SWEENEY Dan? 
DANNY (O.S.) Yeah? 
SWEENEY Dr.  Sweeney. 
INTERCUT THE CONVERSATION 
DANNY (worried) What's going on? 
SWEENEY Nothing here. Is everything all right over there? 
DANNY Everything's fine. 
SWEENEY How's it comin'? 
DANNY I'm doing it right now. 
CMRIS Who is it, dude? 
DANNY (covering the receiver) It's Sweeney. 
CHRIS Who?! Why is he calling here!?  Fuck you, Sweeney! Asshole! 
JASON (grabbing the receiver) Get a fucking job, you reggie! 
Danny grabs the receiver back and yells at his friends. 
DANNY You fuckers are going to get me booted! (into the receiver) Dr. Sweeney? I'm sorry, man. 
Chris, Danny and Jason pound beer and huck DARTS at a picture of O.J. SIMPSON. Seth violently slams past the kids. Derek walks in. 
CHRIS Yo!  What's up, Fat Seth!? 
Seth throws Chris against the wall. 
SETH I'm not fat, cockwart!  I'm husky! 
CMRIS Okay! I'm sorry, bro! 
DANNY Take it easy, dude! 
Seth then grabs Danny hard by the shirt.  Chris and Jason stare at him like he's gonna hurt him. 
DANNY What're you doin'?! 
DEREK Your brother's a piece of shit! 
Seth sees Derek enter and he releases Danny. Seth mixes into the party and SLAM DANCES into ten other skins. Danny follows Seth towards the keg. 
DEREK'S POV. He analyzes the crowd.  Quickly, Chris recognizes him. 
CHRIS Holy shit.  Father Vinyard!? 
JASON Son of a bitch. 
Derek looks at the two kids. 
JASON I'm Jason and that's Chris! We're friends with your brother! 
They stick out their hands but Derek prefers to check the scene. 
CHRIS You're a fuckin' god, man! 
JASON 
No shit! 
DEREK Do me a favor.  Grab Danny and get outta here! 
The two boys look at each other and LAUGH. 
CHRIS We just got here, man! 
DEREK You what!? 
Chris looks at Derek like he's dead. 
DEREK You don't have any homework?! 
JASON School doesn't exist anymore, Father. 
Derek stares at him, not really knowing what to do. 
CHRIS I wrote you. Two letters while you were in there! Did you get them?! 
Derek ignores them and weaves his way through the crowd, causing many an individual to double-take. Chris and Jason look on in wonderment. 
EXT. LARGE, OPEN SHED AREA - A CROWD 
TIGHT ON CAMMERON ALEXANDEr. The older, white trash skin furiously bangs his sticks on the drums to the song. Cam's hair is still long but now he's got a swastika between his eyebrows like CHARLES MANSON. He wears TROY AIKMAN'S DALLAS JERSEY and a BLACK COWBOY HAT. 
DEREK'S POV. He pans right to check out the crowd. A man pisses out the window. Then to a distinct woman. 
IT'S STACEY. Her head is now completely SHAVED but she's still gorgeous as ever. Derek indulges her for a few moments until he turns and walks away.  He bumps into a girl and knocks her drink. 
CASSANDRA Excuse fuckin' me! 
DEREK 
Sorry. 
She smiles at Derek as the SONG comes to a close. 
CASSANDRA 
Derek? 
DEREK Cassandra. 
CAMMERON You made it, man. When I heard they threw you in General Population I thought it was curtains. 
DEREK It wasn't too bad. 
CAMMERON So what's all this self-righteous, born-again shit I'm hearing then? 
Derek doesn't blink.  Cameron smiles and points to a chair. 
CAMMERON Have a seat, Derek.  Relax. 
TIGHT ON CAMMERON. He sparks up a cigi to break Derek's uncomfortable stare. 
CAMMERON How was it in there with all those fuckin' monkeys, man?  You're lucky they didn't kill you. 
DEREK I agree. 
CAMMERON Who runs the place?  The monkeys or the wetbacks? 
DEREK The Mexicans. CAMMERON It's a fuckin' vacation for them in there, hunh? 
DEREK They were really organized. I'll tell ya...it was impressive. They-- 
INT. HOUSE BATHROOM - DANNY AND LIZZY 
CUT TO: 
The two make out. She sits on the sink and wraps her legs around him. They stop and smile at each other. 
LIZZY I like you. 
DANNY I like you, too. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CAMMERON BEDROOM - SAME 
Derek and Cam converse over the coffee table. 
CAMMERON They're fuckin' peasants, Derek.  All of them. (then) So what's up, man? I'm hearing a lot of shit about you. 
DEREK Be careful with me, Cam. You don't know what's going on with me. 
CAMMERON Fuckin' talk to me then. We're family here. Let's work it out whatever it is. 
DEREK I'm family, Cam? Is that why you came to see me all the time up there? 
Cameron smiles but doesn't know what to say. 
CAMMERON I had to distance myself from you after that. 
DEREK Fuck you, Cameron. You're a fucking chicken hawk...praying on kids. 
CAMMERON I don't pray on fucking anyone. 
DEREK No. You fucking use them.  To filter your insanity. 
Cameron smiles in disbelief. 
CAMMERON You and Danny are like brothers to me, Derek. Come on, man. 
DEREK He's not your brother, Cameron.  All right? He's my brother. (after a beat) You hear me, Cam? 
CAMMERON (exploding) Fuck you, Derek! Fuck you! Don't think you can threaten me with this shit for a fuckin' second! I'm more important to him now then you ever were. 
Derek EXPLODES. With his feet, he pushes the GLASS COFFEE TABLE hard into Cammeron's knees. Cam screams in agony. Derek SLUGS him in the face and Cam RETALIATES with two of his own. They wrestle around the room and push their way into the BATHROOM. 
INT. TINY BATHROOM - DEREK AND CAM 
Derek takes Cam by his long hair and SMASHES his face into the mirror. IT SHATTERS. Derek follows with a solid punch to the kidney. 
DEREK You gonna listen?! 
CAMMERON I'm gonna fuckin' kill you. 
Derek bangs Cam's face against the mirror ONCE MORE. 
DEREK Shut the fuck up! You're gonna stay away! That's what you're gonna do! 
Derek rinses Cam's bloody face off by PLUNGING it into the toilet. He pulls him back up and they face the mirror. 
CASSANDRA You got fuckin' guests out there, Cam. 
EXT. PATIO - SAME 
Derek tosses the gun over the fence and looks to Danny. 
DEREK Come with me right now. 
He looks at his brother. He then sees Curtis and three other skins come through the house. Derek stares at Dan and hauls ass down the back alley. 
DANNY'S POV. Curtis arrives and tends to Seth rather than go after Derek. Confused and mildly embarrassed, Danny bolts back into the house to get his board. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. VENICE BLVD. - SLEEPING HOMELESS 
Danny passes them on his board as he conguers the cracks in the street at an incredible rate. He turns the tight corner and cuts off a turning car. The man yells. 
Danny spots his brother walking twenty yards up on the left-hand side of the street and crosses. Approaching quickly, he skates faster and faster as Derek nears a BUS STOP BENCH. Hearing the board, Derek turns to face the clickity clack behind him. 
DANNY LUNGES FROM HIS BOARD AND TACKLES DEREE. The two crash into the street as a car henks from the inside lane, barely missing the duo. Danny punches his brozher in the face. 
DANNY Fucking asshole! 
Derek gets on top of his brother, spots a speeding car heading right for him, and pulls his brother to the sidewalk. Just in time. 
DEREK What the luck are you thinking!? 
DANNY What are you thinking!? Friends don't fight friends, Der! They stick together! 
DEREK They're not friends, Dan! 
DANNY What the hell are they then?! 
Derek picks his brother up and sits him on a BUS STOP BENCH. 
DEREK Just sit there and relax for a second. 
DANNY I don't wanna relax!  You looked like an idiot back there! 
Derek stares and sits next to him. Cars and homeless randomly pass in the b.g. Danny looks at his brother, transfixed in thought. 
DANNY What's happened to you, Derek? 
TIGHT ON DEREK. He looks into his brother's eyes. 
DISSOLVE TO BLACKNESS: 
INT./EXT. CHINO PRISON - ESTABLISHING SHOTS 
FILING OUT OF THE CELL. 
The morning drill. His roommate, an old Latino guy, right behind. Derek's eyes cast among the inmates, noting everyone and looking for a friendly face. He notes a familiar tattoo, catches the guy's eye and nods. 
WALKING THROUGH THE CAFETERIA. 
Derek with his tray. A sea of tables divided by race. He spots a tiny island of white guys at a distant table. He looks at STEVIE THE LEADER, but gets a nod from the HUGE ARYAN next to him. Derek moves to sit with them. 
A WIDE SHOT OF THE YARD. 
From a distance, he approaches the Aryan corner. They casually greet each other. Derek then looks over to the HUGE ARYAN from the cafeteria and to STEVIE MCCORMICK, the crazy looking leader. Derek walks over and shakes their hands. 
CUT TO: 
INT. PRISON LAUNDRY ROOM - MORNING 
Derek quietly folds towels with a young, chattering black man. 
YOUNG MAN You got lucky, man. I was in the kitchen for a year before making it in here. Pots and motherfucking pans... disgusting beef stroganoff shit... boiling hot water...fuck that! (looking over) My name's Lamont, man. 
Derek doesn't even look at LAMONT.  Stone cold, he continues folding. 
LAMONT I got your back. Righteous white Cracker with attitude. Just like the Judge who sentenced me, man. 
Lamont laughs but then becomes serious. 
LAMONT If your smart though you'll remember one thing. You're the nigger in here. Not me. 
CUT TO: 
Everyone laughs. Derek sits and eats, his tail between his legs. 
STEVIE That'll teach you.  Don't be a prick to your superiors. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. NARROW PRISON CORRIDOR - LATE AFTERNOON 
Stevie walks by himself and smokes a cigarette. He turns a corner and standing there waiting for him is DEREK. Derek stares him down. 
STEVIE What do you want? 
DEREK I'm right here, man. You wanna have it out with me, let's go. Just me and you though. 
STEVIE Man...you are a stupid motherfucker. You know that? When are you--? 
Derek cracks him in the face and Stevie falls to the ground. 
DEREK Stupid?! You have anything else to say, you little pussy! Hunh?! 
STEVIE Fuck you! 
Derek kicks the man a few more times and takes off. A few black prisoners laugh at Stevie from the PING PONG TABLE. 
CUT TO: 
INT. PRISON SHOWER - MORNING 
Derek puts his head down under the warm water and closes his eyes. From out of nowhere, he is slammed out of frame to the floor. HUGE ARYAN'and his STOCKY BUDDY from earlier proceed to beat him. Bathers leave and after a few moments, Stevie's boys drop their TOWELS. 
HUGE ARYAN Well well well. A virgin. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. SHOWER - LATER 
Derek lies on the tile floor, bloody and beaten. 
HUGE ARYAN You ain't so tough now, are you? 
The two men smile at each other, kick him and exit. After a few seconds, LAMONT enters with the cart and picks up dirty towels. He spots Derek laying on the tile. 
LAMONT Motherfucker. What now, man? 
He tends to Derek. He picks him up, throws him over his shoulder, and carries him off. 
LAMONT Shit, holmes. (carrying him) Hang on to me, man. You're heavy. 
INT. PRISON INFIRMARY - EVENING 
Derek lies on a table, silent.  A Mexican DOCTOR examines his ass. 
DOCTOR Well, you do have some tearing down here. Christ. Okay. I'm gonna have to stitch you up so I'll be back. 
The doctor passes Dr. Sweeney on his way out. Derek hears Sweeney talk to the doctor and turns his head. The two look at each other for a long moment. Sweeney sits down next to him and puts his hand on Derek's shoulder. Derek finally breaks down and sobs. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HOSPITAL - LATE NIGHT 
Sweeney and Derek in mid-conversation.  A small lamp shines off their faces. 
SWEENEY Honor and loyalty run thick, Derek. Not skin color. Skin is thin. I don't get you, man.  I don't. (after a beat) I got my Doctorate in Education...not in medicine. But if you think babies come into this world evil...you're fucked up, Derek. You're way to smart to believe that shit. (then) There's nothin' more beautiful Derek, nothin' more pure, nothin' more innocent...than a baby. 
DEREK They killed my father, Sweeney. 
SWEENEY Jesus Derek. Use that brain God gave you for chrissake. What are you gonna do? Seek revenge your whole life and become a lifer in here. That's what these guys are like, you wanna be like them? Fucking little boys in prison? Think, man. None of your guys back home give a shit about you. (after a beat) They only care about your brother. The new blood. And he sure as hell can't take care of himself like you could. 
Derek looks at the man with regret. 
DEREK Get me outta here, Sweeney. 
Sweeney looks at the young man, heavily weighing his options. The two lock eyes. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. PRISON QUAD - DAY 
Derek reads by himself on the cement stairs by himself. A shadow approaches from behind. 
The two men sit there speechless as Derek walks over to an awaiting Danny. 
INT. VINYARD HOUSEHOLD - A SLEEPING DORIS 
She snores on the couch. The clock on the wall reads eleven as the boys ENTER. Danny goes to his room whale Derek heads for the girls in the living room. He genzly shakes Davina. 
DEREK Hey. Wake up. 
She looks at him, delirious. 
DAVINA 
What? 
DEREK Time for bed. 
INT. OPEN BEDROOM - DEREK'S POV 
Dan types at the computer as Derek escorts Davina and Doris to bed. 
INT. DAVINA BEDROOM - SAME 
Davina plops herself down and falls asleep instantly. 
DORIS Goodnight. 
DEREK Goodnight, Mom. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BATHROOM - LATE NIGHT 
Derek stares at himself in the mirror. A million thoughts race through his head as computer keys echo in the b.g. He looks at all of his tattoos and SCARS. 
TIGHT ON HIS UPPER BODY. He stares at the SWASTIKA on his tit. He puts his hand over the tattoo to see what he looks like without it. He turns on the shower and gets inside. 
129 INT. SHOWER - TIGHT ON DEREE 
As he soaps himself down, the soap slips out of his hand and sits on.the bottom of the tub. He looks at it a long time before he bends over to pick it up. He immerses his face into the shower faucet and thinks to himself. 
INT. BEDROOM - TIGHT ON DANNY 
He sits back down at the computer and looks back at his brother as he dries off. Danny thinks to himself and types a sentence. 
DANNY (V/O) There was only one person who loved Derek more than me. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. VINYARD HOUSEHOLD - MORNING - FLASHBACK 
The place is immaculate. DENNIS VINYARD, the father of the household, eats his breakfast in his LA COUNTY FIREFIGHTER UNIFORM. Vintage fireman material: muscular, receding hairline, zero facial hair. Handsome. A pretty and well-dressed Doris SINGS while she scrambles eight eggs with mushrooms and peppers. 
DANNY (V/O) That was Dad. They were best friendS. Fathers and sons are never best friends...but they were.. 
YOUNGER DANNY stares at his larger-than-life father with a cap turned backwards. Doris breaks from song and yells to the back. 
DORIS Breakfast! 
DENNIS Okay! Let's go, Davina! Derek! 
DORIS So what's this all about, Dennis? 
Dennis doesn't hear because his attention is on Danny. YOUNGER DEREK, donning a flat-top haircut and no tattoos, walks into the kitchen. The smiling athlete has his backpack and blue VENICE HIGH gym bag. He drops it all onto the ground and sits at the table. 
DENNIS Good morning. 
DEREK Good morning. 
Doris sets food in front of her two sons and they both go to work. Young Danny eats quietly. 
DORIS What about this gang stuff? 
DENNIS Jesus Doris...it's not that big of a deal. All departments have to take a precaution class on gang patrol today. 
DEREK What for? 
DENNIS A guy was shot yesterday in Inglewood...changin' a valve on a hydrant. LAPD is worried that more firefighters will become targets. That's what this bullshit is about. (sipping his coffee) A good father this guy was though and now he's in intensive care because of some goddamn--! They've pretty much declared war on LAPD and us. 
DORIS Why you guys though? I can see them but the fire department? 
DENNIS You wanna go to Der's game with me? 
DANNY 
Sure. 
DENNIS (quickly to Derek} Santa Monica High tonight, right? 
DEREK 
Yep. 
DENNIS Perfect. (to Danny) Ben'll whip us up a couple of double deckers and we'll head over. 
DANNY (smiling) 
Okay. 
Dennis smiles, reaches over with a fatherly hand, and messes up his hair. 
BACK QUICKLY TO: 
INT. BEDROOM - DANNY - PRESENT 
He stops typing and almost cries. He leans back in his chair and and stares himself in the side mirror. He feels his bald head, almost exploring. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. BEN'S BURGER SHOP - LATE NIGHT 
A white homeless man in an ARMY JACKET sits outside begging for change. Seth and Cameron, both beat-up, drunk and bloody, stare at the man. 
HOMELESS MAN Spare change for a cheeseburger? 
SETH Get a job and buy one why don't you. 
HOMELESS MAN God bless you. 
SETH Fuck you. 
Seth stumbles into the shop.  Cam stares at the homeless man, psychotically. 
HOMELESS MAN Fifty cents is all I ask. Vietnam, man. 
I was in 
CAMMERON Really? So you've had what? Thirty years to get your shit together? 
HOMELESS MAN All I want is something to eat. 
CAMMERON There are plenty of fuckin' dishwashing jobs out there, Vietnam boy. Go get yourself one. 
In the background, BEN THE OWNER and Seth shake hands. 
HOMELESS MAN Did I do something? 
CAMMERON You're a disgrace to the white race. If Adolf Hitler was alive...God bless his soul...he would have you shot. 
HOMELESS MAN Fuck you then. Now and forever.  Fuck you. 
Cameron knees the weaker man square in the face. The man slopes down to his side, unconscious. As an afterthought, Cameron kicks him several more times. 
CAMMERON Noooo. Fuck you. 
QUICKLY TO ACROSS THE STREET. Little Henry and two of his friends watch Cammeron's brutality from their bikes. They turn in the opposite direction and hurry off. 
INT. BURGER SHOP - CAMHERON AND SETH 
CUT TO: 
Seth eats a burger and chili fries at the same time. Cameron smokes across from him and watches Seth eat like a pig. He takes a look at the homeless man outside who still lays motionless. Cam feels his BANDAGED FACE. 
CAMMERON I think I need to go to the hospital. 
SETH Seriously? 
CAMMERON I don't know. I think so. 
SETH Where's Stacey? 
CAMMERON It wouldn't irritate me so much if the ratio was a little more even. 
SETH What's that? 
CAMMERON (going mad) Ebony and Ivory back there! Almost all of those orange kid relationships are black man and white women and I'm fucking sick of seein' it! I wouldn't mind so much if it were more even. 
SETH Huge dicks, Cam.  That's all it is. 
CAMMERON I used to think that too but...it's gotta be more, man. It has to be more than the fact they they carry a big load. Chicks aren't that shallow, are they? It's politically correct... that's what it is. White women...bein' seen with the coloreds...it's great for their image. Bitches today want to be known as bein' fuckin' color blind. 
SETH They get off on it. 
CAMMERON And you can't really blame Tyrone. 
SETH Why the fuck not? 
CAMMERON Well...how'd you like to drag around some fat fly girl? I wouldn't. 
SETH No shit. (imitating) Oh go girlfriend! Don't be puttin' up wid dat, girl! Oh stop girl! 
Seth and Cammeron laugh and head outside--leaving a mess on the table.

INT. VAN - TIGHT ON LITTLE HENRY 
Me bites his nails and watches the foursome sneak up on an oblivious Seth and Cammeron. 
EXT. GRAVEL PARKING LOT - HENRY'S POV 
The men close in. Seth and Cam are blind to it.  Jerome raises the bat as they close in and we-- 
FADE TO: 
INT. BATHROOM - EARLY MORNING - BIRDS CHIRPING 
Danny stares at himself in the mirror and tries to find some stubble on his chin. 
INT. BEDROOM - A SLICK DEREK 
He stares into the mirror in a coat and pants.  Danny rushes to get his things together. 
DANNY I'm printing it up and we're out of here. 
DEREK Hurry up. 
Derek walks out into the living room. 
INT. MESSY LIVING ROOM - DORIS 
She's on the couch watching cartoons. She takes a jar of Vick's Vapor Rub and puts some on her chest. Derek walks in the room, bends over and kisses her on the forehead. Davina sits on the couch and writes. Derek just smiles. 
DORIS Wow. What happened? 
DEREK I gotta see my parole officer. 
DAVINA Hey Der? Do you have Excel on disk? 
DEREK I've got everything on disk. 
Davina smiles and walks into the back bedroom.  Doris looks at Derek. 
DORIS You look good. 
Derek smiles and caresses his mother's cheek. 
DEREK We're getting out of here soon.  Is that okay with you? 
RASMUSSEN They'll live. (then) They must have been looking for somebody else. 
Derek stares at Rasmussen and walks away. Sweeney, who knows to walk over to him. 
He eyes 
TIGHT ON SWEENEY AND DEREK. The two lock eyes. 
SWEENEY Are they coming after you? 
DEREK Fuckin' A. 
Sweeney sighs. 
SWEENEY I don't know. (after a long beat) You might have to talk to your old crew though. 
Derek looks over and analyzes the innocence of his brother. 
DEREK I can't, Sweeney. 
SWEENEY Try, Derek. Okay? 
Derek senses the danger in his voice. 
SWEENEY Okay?  Before it explodes. 
Sweeney walks away and then turns back to Derek. 
SWEENEY And watch your back. 
Derek nods. 
SWEENEY (back to Danny) You showing up today? 
Danny looks at Sweeney and nods his head yes. 
SWEENEY 
Good. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. VENICE HIGH - DEREK AND DANNY 
They are outside the fence surrounding the field. Students head off to morning class. 
DEREK Hey. Keep your head up, alright?  I'm going to take care of this. 
DANNY How? 
DEREK I don't know. I'll figure it out though. You gonna be okay? 
DANNY Yeah. 
The two stare at each other as THE BELL RINGS. 
DANNY I gotta turn that paper in. 
Danny hops the fence with his backpack on. He looks back at Derek. Cops #1 and #2 sit in their car in the b.g. 
DEREK Hey. 
DANNY What? 
DEREK Come here. 
Derek puts his hand over the fence. Danny walks up and clasps it -- FINGERS INTERTWINED. Derek wants to say one thing but something else comes out. 
DEREK I'll see you at home. 
Danny smiles at his brother and nods. Danny puts his ear phones on and heads to class. Derek watches his brother through the chain-link fence. Danny meets up with Lizzy and they soon disappear from Derek's sight. Derek turns and walks down the street. 
COP #1 You need a lift anywhere? 
DEREK Nope. 
Derek stops in his tracks, walks back over to the fence, and stares at the school. 
INT. MESSY HALLWAY - DANNY AND LIZZY

SEVENTH DRAFT 3 FEBRUARY 1999 
FADE IN: 
MAIN CREDITS ROLL 
over BLACK SCREEN, with PORTENTOUS SPOOKY MUSIC underneath. Just as the music reaches its crescendo, we hear a simian SCREECH. 
A BUCK-TOOTHED CARTOON MONKEY swings past on a vine. TITLE WIPES IN with him: 
MONKEYBONE(tm) in "FREUD CHICKEN!" 
TIGHT CLOSEUP - STANLEY (ANIMATED) 
A POCKETWATCH swings back and forth in F.G. Gaping at it is a goofy, bespectacled CARTOON CHARACTER, sucking his thumb as his EYES move back and forth. After a moment, the LEFT EYE freezes in place - but the right eye keeps going back and forth with the watch. 
SHRINK'S VOICE (o.s.) Back, Stanley...you're going back...back to when it all began. Are you going back yet? Come on, get back, ve haven't got all day. 
Now BOTH EYES are locked in place. The patient is hypnotized. 
INT. SCHOOLROOM - DAY (ANIMATED) 
A squat, lumpy TEACHER, MISS HUDLAPP, is straining to erase the Gettysburg Address, which is written along the very top of the blackboard. There's an obtrusive, rhythmic BANGING noice in B.G. 
STANLEY (V.O.) It was third grade. The teacher was Miss Hudlapp. She was kinda squat and lumpy - she smelled funny - but she was kind. 
MISS HUDLAPP CLASS! (turning around suddenly) How many times have I told you? In this class we do not pound tenpenny nails into Stanley's head! 
REVERSE ANGLE - ON STANLEY 
Hapless ten-year-old STANLEY, still goofy and bespectacled, in his front-row desk. NAILS stick out of his head. The FOUR MEAN KIDS poised around him lower their hammers and return to their seats, grumbling. 
A dreamy SMILE crosses STANLEY's face as he gazes at MISS HUDLAPP. 
STANLEY (V.O.) You know how some teachers have those, kind of, flaps on their arms - those big sacks of limp flab that like, dangle? 
As MISS HUDLAPP pulls her sweater off, TWO MASSIVE ARM-FLAPS - fifty gallons of flab apiece - SPILL OUT and SMACK INTO THE FLOOR. 
MISS HUDDLAPP claps two erasers together, kicking up a cloud of dust. Young STANLEY watches, transfixed by her massive ARM FLAPS. We TRACK IN on the gigantic ARM FLAPS as they swing hypnotically back and forth, with a loud SLAP each time they collide. 
STANLEY (V.O.) It sounds weird...but for some reason, as I watched those big old flaps of hers, I began to feel...well...oddly... 
Now we TRACK IN on the mesmerized STANLEY. A SONG comes up underneath: Donna Summer, "I FEEL LOVE." 
STANLEY (V.O.) ...aroused. (beat) And then the horror began. 
DOINK! STANLEY looks down at his LAP in horror. The boys and girls around him are pointing and tittering. 
Grimacing in embarrassment, he discreetly places a heavy TEXTBOOK onto his lap, suppressing the bulge in his pants. But SPROING!! - the BOOK goes flying across the room. The BULGE is fighting back! 
The kids DUCK AND COVER beneath their desks as STANLEY slams a STACK of textbooks onto his lap. It's no use - the WHOLE STACK goes flying, and BOOKS come raining down on the entire class! Now MISS HUDLAPP is staring directly at him... 
MISS HUDLAPP Young man. What's that in your lap? 
She marches toward him. STANLEY pulls his BACKPACK over his lap. 
STANLEY (V.O.) It was useless. Like putting a baseball cap on the Washington Monument. And then...all at once ...there he was. 
The BACKPACK bucks and wriggles, as if something inside is trying to GET OUT. And then - with a flourish of rousing disco strings - IT DOES! 
STANLEY (V.O.) Monkeybone!! 
The libidinous cartoon monkey BURSTS OUT of the backpack, POINTS at MISS HUDLAPP - and announces, in his Barry White baritone: 
MONKEYBONE Oooo-oo-ooh, baby. I love your way. 
BEAUTIFUL FAN Mr. Miley, would you draw Monkeybone on my belly? As a guide? 
STU Guide...? 
BEAUTIFUL FAN For my tattoo artist? 
She exposes her taut midriff. STU thinks for a moment, then goes to work. When he's done, Monkeybone appears to be climbing out of the girl's pants and WAVING to her. Nearby FANS APPLAUD. 
BEAUTIFUL FAN Wait! You have to draw the rest of him - 
She begins unbuckling her belt so STU will have enough room to draw Monkeybone's bottom half. STU demurs... 
STU I - I have to, uh, check in with my doctor. DO- OCCCC!! 
He wanders across the room, finds JULIE deep in conversation with a bunch of other GUESTS, and pulls her aside. 
STU Hey, Doc. Come here. There's something really cool I want to show you. 
He grabs her by the sleeve, pulls her across the floor to - 
INT. ALCOVE - OFF LOBBY - CONTINUOUS 
There's nothing "cool" about it - it's a stairway landing, with metal fire doors that open onto the parking lot outside. 
STU See these doors? The cool thing is, you go out ...they close...you can't get back in! 
He opens one door and holds it for JULIE. 
JULIE You want to leave? But Stu - you're a big hit! Everyone loves you! 
STU They don't love me. They love Monkeybone. 
JULIE It was you who got the standing O. It was you drawing on the belly over there... 
STU That was especially Monkeybone. Come on, Doc, I don't want to be stuck here with this bunch of media creeps. I just want to be us. Home. Alone! (conspiratorially) I have something I have to give you. 
JULIE Can't you give it to me later? 
STU Yeah, I could, but the thing is, if later got here sooner, it would be...better. 
He gives up trying to explain...pulls her close and kisses her. For a moment they completely forget about the party in the next room. 
Then HERB appears behind them, trying to catch STU's eye as he waits for the clinch to break up. Finally he pries them apart: 
HERB Sorry, Julie - won't be a minute. Now Stu - I know you don't like the idea, but you really ought to talk to these guys - 
STU Julie and I - we were just gonna go... 
But before STU knows what's hit him, HERB is leading him back to - 
INT. LOBBY - THAT MOMENT - CONTINUOUS 
HERB Go? There's a potload of money here, pal. You got three major toy companies...you got the guys from Burger God over here... 
STU Burger God. The ones that found the pig hair in the french fries? 
HERB Never proven. They're ready to pop for a pre- emptive endorsement. Kids love Burger God - 
The MERCHANDISERS shoot STU an expectant wave. STU waves back and turns in the opposite direction. HERB grabs him by the sleeve. 
STU Herb, it's too much. It's all out of hand. 
HERB Do you know what kind of opportunity you have here? You gotta strike. I'm talking mansions. Lamborghinis. Champagne for mouthwash when you brush your teeth! 
STU I don't want to be rich. It's just a trap! 
HERB Being rich is not a trap. That is a dirty lie perpetuated by rich people to keep the failures from killing them. 
STU Herb. I have to go. 
HERB Why? 
STU I got the ring. (beat) Tonight's the night, Herb. Tonight's the night. 
He nods toward JULIE, who's at the open bar grabbing two glasses of punch. HERB realizes a proposal is in the works. 
She thinks it over, nods. STU takes a moment to catch his breath, then opens the door gingerly. A HORN BLARES as a car speeds past in the opposite lane, nearly taking STU's door off. He jumps back inside, waits, opens the door again... 
EXT. INTERSECTION - THAT MOMENT 
His eyes widen in horror as he steps out to survey the scene. The asphalt is strewn with MONKEYBONE MERCHANDISE - stuffed dolls, games, lunchboxes. SKID MARKS show where the TRUCK which was carrying all this SWERVED... 
...and slammed into the rear of a BUICK REGAL, pinning it up against a TELEPHONE POLE. STU races up to the Buick. Its front end is mashed up like an accordion, but the occupants - a couple of TEENAGERS dressed for the prom - seem to be okay. 
STU Hey! Are you guys all right in there? 
TEENAGE GIRL We're fine. 
STU That stupid monkey banner! It fell on my windshield - it practically killed us all! (to JULIE) God, Julie, if anything had happened to you - 
JULIE I'm fine, baby. We're all okay. We were lucky. 
STU I'd better go report this... 
He spots a PHONE BOOTH and starts across the street. On the way there he plucks a STUFFED MONKEYBONE DOLL off the pavement and CHOKES IT with both hands. 
JULIE stays behind with the prom kids. The TEENAGE BOY in his tux is glassy-eyed, miserable beyond description. 
JULIE Dad's car? 
The BOY begins to SOB softly. JULIE nods in sympathy. 
Then: EVERYONE WINCES. The air is full of a horrible CREAKING noise, like nails on a blackboard... 
TEENAGE GIRL What was that? Did you hear that? 
The horrible CREAKING NOISE continues. JULIE turns. Behind her, the TELEPHONE POLE that the car slammed into is beginning to TEETER. Then it TOPPLES. Directly toward... 
JULIE STU!! 
ON STU - IN PHONE BOOTH 
He sees JULIE running toward him and holds up a single finger. 
STU Operator? I want to report an accident. 
Finally he glances up - just in time to see the TELEPHONE POLE coming down toward the phone booth like a gigantic sledgehammer. His eyes widen. The STUFFED MONKEYBONE slips from his grasp... 
CLOSEUP - MONKEYBONE 
A HORRIBLE CRASH. SCREAMS. CAMERA ZEROES IN on the MONKEYBONE DOLL which STU was holding, surrounded by broken glass, its face twisted into an insane, almost macabre grin. 
The screen fades to PITCH BLACK for a few seconds...until we hear a DISTANT SIREN, and an IMAGE comes swimming into focus... 
STU'S POV: ON JULIE 
He's in the back of an ambulance, with PARAMEDICS all around him, working feverishly. JULIE hovers above him, holding his hand. 
JULIE Stu? I'm here, baby. It's me. It's Julie. I love you. You're gonna be okay, baby, I promise - 
All at once he seems to be RECEDING from JULIE and the others - as if SINKING THROUGH the bottom of the stretcher, and BEYOND - through the floor of the ambulance! JULIE's voice grows weaker, more distant: 
JULIE (V.O.) I'm here, baby. I won't leave you... 
And then all trace of the ambulance is gone, and he's floating down through some strange LIMBO, surrounded by the silhouettes of billowing SHROUDS, with the sound of BIRDS CALLING all around him... 
An AWFUL MECHANICAL RATCHETING NOISE fills the soundtrack. STU's eyes close - and when they reopen, he finds himself in: 
EXT. TROLLEY - MOVING 
A tiny ROLLER-COASTER CAR descends from dense clouds down the length of an impossibly long and rickety METAL TRACK. The track leads through a vast black VOID... 
...to a tiny ISLAND floating in the darkness...an island that looks not unlike a disembodied FIST. 
And, as the car draws closer, the fist begins to OPEN - tulip-like - turning into a HAND, with a full-sized TOWN nestled in its palm! In the town, CARNIVAL LIGHTS begin to glitter. MUSIC begins to tinkle... 
EXT. PLATFORM - NIGHT 
The car - a one-passenger job with a CARTOON ANIMAL FACE on its prow - stops with a lurch. STU steps out onto a fog-shrouded TRAIN STATION PLATFORM. Before he knows it, the little car DEPARTS behind him. He's stranded - alone. 
STU Hello? Anybody? - Am I dead? (beat) PLEASE. I'D LIKE TO KNOW IF I'M DEAD. 
JULIE I'm serious. It was bicameral disjunction - right brain and left brain out of balance. He was a rightie, so I made him switch the pencil to his left hand. Just to see what'd come out. 
A smile comes to JULIE's face. She settles in on the floor beside ALICE and digs through the various portfolios until she comes up with a quickie CARTOON on the back of a napkin - the prototype for... 
ALICE Monkeybone? 
JULIE Left-handed, he was funny. He'd been doing all this scary, intense work...then he found out he could draw this stuff, and make me laugh, and he liked that. (shrugging) And then the nightmares just...stopped. 
ALICE Wow - two guys in the same brain. - Which one did you fall in love with? 
JULIE smiles at the cartoon. She isn't telling. 
JULIE I've put a ton of work into that boy, Alice. I am not going to let him get away from me. 
INT. ICU - MORNING 
JULIE, in her white lab coat, wanders through Intensive Care and finds a WOMAN hunched over STU's bed, BAWLING HER EYES OUT. 
JULIE Kimmy...? 
KIMMY looks up. She's crying so much she can barely recognize JULIE. 
KIMMY Oh, Julie...my poor Stu...my poor baby brother... 
JULIE When'd you get in? 
KIMMY An hour ago. (gathering herself) I tried to prepare myself, but I didn't know he would be like, like this. I can't even bear to look at him... How about you? You're okay? 
JULIE I'm fine, Kimmy. Fine. 
KIMMY I had so much I always wanted to say to him. At least he had a chance to give you the ring. 
JULIE The ring... 
KIMMY Grandmama's ring. The engagement ring. He asked me to send it to him - 
JULIE turns to look at STU in the bed. The certain knowledge that he was about to propose is like a knife in her heart. KIMMY feels bad as well, having let the cat out of the bag, but before they can hash it out - 
VOICE FROM BEHIND Mrs. Brewster? Julie? I'm Dr. Edelstein. 
Cheery DR. EDELSTEIN enters. He shakes hands with the women, then checks STU's readouts, making notations on his clipboard. 
DR. EDELSTEIN Vital signs have stabilized. That's good. 
KIMMY Can you give us a realistic sense of my brother's chances? 
DR. EDELSTEIN He's held on this far. We can't do much but wait and see. 
KIMMY But these...machines are what's keeping him alive, is that right? 
This remark sends a shiver down JULIE's spine, but she keeps silent. 
DR. EDELSTEIN At the moment, yes. 
KIMMY Can you give me a realistic idea...of how long this is going to last? 
DR. EDELSTEIN Comas are unpredictable. He could wake up today, tomorrow, a month from now... 
KIMMY Honey, I have to clarify this. The thing is, Dr. Edelstein, my brother has an absolute horror of doctors - hospitals - needles - all of it - 
JULIE Kimmy, he doesn't know what's going on. He doesn't even know he's in a - 
KIMMY Please, Julie. This is not easy for me. Our father took a long time to die. A long time. It just about killed us all. And Stu and I made a pact that when our time came - we wouldn't let it drag out. 
JULIE It's too soon even to - talk about that! 
KIMMY Give me a date, Doctor. 
DR. EDELSTEIN Three months. (pause) 
There's always some brain damage. But at three months...the chances of coming back shrink dramatically with every day. 
KIMMY I want him to have every chance, Doctor. We can certainly give it...three months. 
No one says anything. But both women look at STU, and then at each other, and everyone knows exactly where everyone else stands. JULIE has a sinking feeling that STU is working on a 3-month deadline. 
The DARKTOWNERS are rubbing their hands together in anticipation of horrors to come. STU looks from one misshapen face to the next, his heart pounding with dread. 
STU What is this? Who's dreaming this?? (beat) Julie?? 
YETI Hey, keep it down! 
EXT. FIELD OF FLOWERS (NIGHTMARE ORB) - DAY 
JULIE rolls onto her back on the grass, FACE AGLOW. Only to realize... that STU IS NO LONGER THERE BESIDE HER. 
She looks around. Gets to her feet. Turns. And the BACKGROUND behind her MORPHS suddenly into... 
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM (NIGHTMARE ORB) 
The room is decorated for a FAREWELL PARTY, complete with streamers and confetti. KIMMY, DR. EDELSTEIN, various MEDICAL PERSONNEL and FRIENDS are wearing party hats, lifting champagne glasses in a toast to the guest of honor...the comatose Stu! 
INT. HYP'S HIDEAWAY - THAT MOMENT 
The DARKTOWNERS clustered around the orb can barely conceal their animal excitement. It's obvious that the nightmares they're watching are more than mere entertainment - they get some kind of addictive, visceral charge from the spectacle of human terror. 
STU JULIE!! 
He tries to push his way forward to the orb. An angry CYCLOPS elbows him aside. A YETI grabs his coat and pushes him out of the way. 
HAND WOMAN Stu!! What are you doing? Chill out!! 
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM (NIGHTMARE ORB) 
COMATOSE STU stands in the center of the room, UPRIGHT and IMMOBILE in a party hat. A weird UMBILICAL CORD extends from his navel to a huge groaning BELLOWS DEVICE - like an artificial lung, it's all that keeps him breathing. 
EDELSTEIN hands a pair of OVERSIZED CEREMONIAL SCISSORS to KIMMY, and she CUTS THE CORD, as if opening a new mall. Applause all around. JULIE races toward STU in slo-mo, SHRIEKING - 
- as he DEFLATES into a LIMP PUDDLE OF FLESH before her eyes!! 
JULIE No. No. STU! 
INT. HYP'S HIDEAWAY - ON STU 
JULIE's distress is killing him. Yet all around him, DARKTOWNERS are cackling their heads off, growling, howling, punching their fists in the air like rowdy drunks at a football game. He LOSES IT ALTOGETHER. 
STU JULIE! I'M HERE, DOC! DON'T LET THEM PULL THE PLUG! I'M HERE!!! 
He won't be stopped this time. He makes for the orb - climbing over sofas, pushing guests aside, knocking over their drinks - 
CYCLOPS HEY! Watch it, you stinkin' gringo - 
STU JULIE! I'M HERE! I LOVE YOU! 
Somehow, JULIE has heard him!! Down in the nightmare orb, her dream self is looking UP, trying to locate the source of STU's disembodied voice! He struggles to reach the orb, but the CYCLOPS is holding him back. 
JULIE Stu? STU...? 
STU breaks free and FLINGS HIMSELF on the ORB - which SHORTS OUT in a haze of smoke and sparks, abruptly ending the nightmare. JULIE's image vanishes - and STU gropes at the air, DESPAIRING. 
INT. STU'S PRIVATE ROOM - NIGHT 
The real JULIE awakens suddenly and lets out a scream of her own. 
JULIE STU!!!! 
Only now does she realize where she is. She's fallen asleep in the visitor's chair next to STU's bed. The clock on the wall reads 1:15 AM. 
STU'S READOUTS are spiking like crazy. 
INT. HYP'S HIDEAWAY - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT 
STU is being dragged across the dance floor by the YETI and JUMBO THE ELEPHANT GOD. HAND WOMAN brings up the rear. 
JUMBO Who invited this schmuck, anyway? 
HAND WOMAN Oh, it's my fault. I thought he was cooler than that. 
STU Listen. Please. It's my girlfriend. I've gotta get a message to her... 
But just then a hush falls over the room, and someone screams... 
In checking his watch, STU removes his hand from MONKEYBONE's mouth. The singsong resumes... 
MONKEYBONE I'm so dumb! I deserve to die - 
STU Mr. Hypnos, you run this place. I'm begging you. There's gotta be something I can do. 
HYPNOS Stu, I like you personally, I admire your work, but I'm just the God of Sleep. This is Death's bailiwick. 
STU Maybe you could talk to Death! 
HYPNOS Me? Me, go crawling to Death? My friend, it will be a cold, cold day in Las Vegas, Nevada, before I go crawling to that piece of - 
HYP shuts up. Looks around the room, as if he's afraid of being overheard. Then he gestures to the boys to join him on the bed. 
They climb aboard eagerly. HYPNOS hits his remote... 
INT. HYPNOS'S BEDROOM - ON BED 
...and they rotate AWAY from the party. Privacy at last. 
HYPNOS Now Death is not what you would call a people person, like me. Death is a putz - and I should know. I'm his little brother. 
STU You're Death's brother? 
HYPNOS Oh yeah. Mr. By-the-book, Stick-Up-the-Ass, My- Way-or-the-Highway Death. Believe me - over the course of eternity, you get pretty damned tired of that schtick. (spreading his hands) 
So I need a job. He sticks me in this broke-down amusement park, with a buncha animals to run it. I'm supposed to be grateful? 
MONKEYBONE The penthouse is pretty swank, though. 
HYPNOS Thank you. I decorated it myself. 
STU Guys, I don't mean to be rude, but I only have eleven hours and fifty-three minutes to... 
HYPNOS Oh, right. Cheating Death. There's one thing you might try. Only one guy in history ever pulled it off. Well, actually two. Actually, no, there was that other guy who...well, very few people have done it. 
STU Hyp, I'll do anything. 
MONKEYBONE Me too. And I mean anything. Ask the chicks in the back room. 
HYPNOS You've seen those E-tickets, right? Well, what you gotta do...is go into the Land of Death... and steal an E-ticket right out from under Death's nose. 
STU Land of Death. How do I get there? 
HYPNOS Kid, listen: that's all I'm saying. And you didn't hear it from me. 
HYP hits the remote. The bed begins to ROTATE OUTWARD again. 
HYPNOS You've heard of a fate worse than Death? That's what's waiting for you if you screw up. 
INT. HYP'S HIDEAWAY - A MOMENT LATER 
HYP gives the boys a wink and a thumbs-up, then wanders off to shmooze his other guests. MONKEYBONE shakes STU's hand. 
MONKEYBONE Fate worse than death! Well, it's been real, boss, but I gotta go buff up my resumé. ANYBODY HERE NEED A FIGMENT? 
STU Fine! Don't put yourself out. I'll go to the land of Death alone. 
MONKEYBONE Stu, you have my absolute confidence. ­- DEAD MAN! DEAD MAN WALKING!! 
STU (grabbing him by the throat) I've got one chance to get back to Julie, and I'm gonna take it - with or without you. 
He turns and stalks off. MONKEYBONE stands there blinking. 
MONKEYBONE Hey. Aren't you gonna talk me into it? 
STU No. Goodbye. Thanks for nothing. 
Stunned, MONKEYBONE scurries along behind him, PLEADING. 
MONKEYBONE You gotta talk me into it. You'll screw up on your own. I mean, a guy's gotta have a sidekick. For moral support! Wisecracks - snappy banter - (wrapping himself around STU's leg) It's the land of Death, Stu, the Land of Death! Don't go in there without your comedy relief!! 
STU All right. You can come. 
MONKEYBONE OH, THANK YOU! THANK YOU! TH-- (suddenly realizing) Something went very, very wrong here. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. SLEEP LAB - PRE-DAWN 
The wall clock says it's not quite 3 AM, yet JULIE has managed to round up all her co-workers: ALICE, HUTCH, CLARISSA, et al. They're groggy, disheveled, un-made-up, unshaven. But they're there. 
JULIE Six hours. That's when they pull the plug. That's how long we've got to wake him up. (beat) 
Now these are Stu's old charts from five years ago, when he first came to the sleep lab... 
She points to a series of EASELS where HUTCH and ALICE have been tacking up EEG printouts, engram maps, etc. 
JULIE ...they show incredibly intense nightmare activity. The chart below is his new chart... 
The lower chart shows a JAGGED SPIKE virtually identical to the one on the upper chart. JULIE pauses for effect - then pulls on the edge of the lower chart, OPENING IT UP like a gatefold - 
The onlookers GASP. Opened accordion-style, the lower chart shows the SAME SPIKE recurring again and again, TEN TIMES OVER! 
HUTCH Holy shit. 
JULIE He's stuck in a loop - a nightmare loop. (beat) Anybody here know what Oneirix is? 
CLARISSA Sure - it's an enzyme. The brain secretes it during violent dream activity... 
HUTCH It's nightmare juice. Julie and I were on the team that learned to synthesize it. If those charts are right, Stu's swimming in the stuff. (puzzled) Are you thinking we can decrease the levels? 
JULIE No. I want to give him more. I want to give him a massive dose. 
HUTCH That's not going to stop his nightmare - 
JULIE I don't want to stop the nightmare, Hutch. I want to crank it up. I want to take it right off the charts. I want to scare him awake. 
The group exchanges nervous glances: it's risky. JULIE claps her hands: 
JULIE All right! We have a plan. Let's move! 
As the group swings into action, HUTCH pulls JULIE aside. 
HUTCH You know, Julie, even if this works - which it probably won't - that stuff is tricky. You don't know what it'll do to his brain. 
JULIE What'll it do if they pull the plug? 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. LAND OF DEATH - NIGHT 
A PANORAMIC VIEW of an impossibly grand, Gilded-Age TRAIN STATION. A central turntable is the hub for dozens of TUNNELS, which converge like the spokes of a wheel, disgorging long trains full of DEAD PASSENGERS from all over the world. 
Far above, in the dizzying reaches of the vaulted DOME that crowns the station, REAPERS on FLYING BICYCLES spiral about like mosquitos, bringing dead souls to their final reward. 
This is Thanatopolis - land of Death - truly the end of the line. 
A WET SQUEEGEE scrapes across the frame - wielded by a GRIM REAPER in a jumpsuit bearing the logo of "LAND OF DEATH WINDOW WASHERS, INC." The noise is irritating, so a REAPER on the inside snaps the venetian blinds shut, cutting off our view. 
CAMERA PULLS BACK, and we realize we've been seeing all this through the wall-to-wall windows of... 
INT. DEATH'S OFFICE - NIGHT 
It looks like the observation bridge in the nose of the Nautilus; the decor is ornate, and the office equipment - vacuum tubes, pipe intercoms, etc. - is on loan from the Jules Verne Museum of Defunct Technology. 
REAPERS are bustling about everywhere. One of them pushing a HAND TRUCK laden with oversized crates bearing the label "DEAD SOULS." 
REAPER Batch of souls - just back from Processing. 
DEATH'S ASSISTANT Put them over there with the others. 
He unloads the crates in a corner of the room, where SCORES of crated souls are already piled up. 
DEATH'S ASSISTANT Your Grimness? We have a new shipment - 
DEATH (o.s.) Yeah, yeah, yeah... I'll get to it... 
We can't see DEATH himself - just the back of a tall swivel chair. With much creaking, it rotates around - bringing us face-to-face with... 
CLOSEUP - DEATH 
The ASSISTANT hands the REAPER a YELLOW MAILMAN'S POUCH containing the E-ticket. But before he can depart, the STAINED REAPER - aka STU and MONKEYBONE - jumps to the front of the line. 
MONKEYBONE Say, Death, just out of curiosity, could we maybe swap jobs with that other guy? See, we've been meaning to drop in on Dark Town - I mean I've been meaning to... 
DEATH is stunned by this unprecedented breach of protocol. The other REAPERS in the line are ABUZZ. 
DEATH ...I beg your pardon? 
MONKEYBONE I got relatives there. I...EEP!! 
CLOSEUP - ON STU - UNDER SHROUD 
An ENRAGED STU is yanking on MONKEYBONE'S TAIL, signalling him to shut up. MONKEYBONE, in pain, squeals repeatedly. Finally he reaches down and PUNCHES STU IN THE NOSE. 
INT. DEATH'S OFFICE - BACK TO SCENE 
The blow sends STU staggering. DEATH and the other REAPERS look on in astonishment as the STAINED REAPER does a bizarre DANCE across the floor, top half and bottom half moving independently. Miraculously, he manages to right himself and regain his balance. 
DEATH Now what were you saying? 
STU/MONKEYBONE (in unison) Nothing. 
DEATH I'd like to have a word with you in private. 
He stands and gestures toward a side room. The boys follow. The little HELLHOUND scampers out from behind the desk... 
...and GRABS THE HEM OF THEIR SHROUD in its teeth! The boys keep on walking, but the shroud stays behind. Somehow they go three or four steps before they realize they've been exposed. 
DEATH jumps a foot in the air and SHRIEKS. PANDEMONIUM ERUPTS. 
DEATH IMPOSTORS!! GET 'EM!! 
The boys back toward the big WINDOW overlooking the trainyard. The REAPERS close in on them, BRANDISHING THEIR SCYTHES. 
DEATH HYPNOS! That little twerp! He's the one who put you up to this! 
With a SCREECH, MONKEYBONE LEAPS into the air, BOUNDS OVER the heads and shoulders of the advancing REAPERS, and SNATCHES the yellow E-ticket pouch from the guy Death gave it to. 
He bounds over a table and into STU's arms, with the precious pouch in hand! DEATH lets out a great rattling BELLOW OF RAGE. 
His features begin to JITTER VIOLENTLY. HIS HEAD EXPLODES!!! 
MONKEYBONE Yowie. 
Nothing to lose at this point. With a CRASH, the boys DIVE THROUGH THE BIG WINDOW overlooking the trainyard! 
The headless DEATH gropes around blindly, waving to his ASSISTANT. 
DEATH Head. HEAD!! 
The ASSISTANT opens a cabinet containing a half-dozen identical HEADS. He pulls out a spare and screws it onto DEATH's neck. 
EXT. TRAINYARD - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT 
The boys land hard at the edge of the trainyard. Behind them, REAPERS are shepherding a line of newly arrived DEAD PEOPLE past a sign which reads: "PROCESSING - THIS WAY." 
By the time they can dust themselves off, an ALARM starts blaring. REAPERS drop what they're doing, point at the boys. Panic time! 
Nearby, a FLYING BICYCLE is propped up against a SIGN. Side-by-side they race toward the bike, each of them clutching the strap of the pouch, YANKING each other back and forth in a tug-of-war. 
STU's bigger. He pulls the pouch onto his shoulder, and MONKEYBONE with it. They grab the bike, climb aboard, and pedal off - 
- revealing the SIGN it was leaning against: "CYCLE REPAIR." 
EXT. TRAINYARD - ON BICYCLE - THAT MOMENT 
STU pedals onto the central turntable area. The BATWINGS on the rear of the bike flap feebly, but the flying bike just won't fly. 
MONKEYBONE looks over his shoulder. A small ARMY of REAPERS, anned with scythes, is pouring into the trainyard behind them. 
MONKEYBONE Stu...Stu... 
STU IT'S NOT WORKING. 
MONKEYBONE There's a thing here! There's a switch! 
Since they're both looking the wrong way, neither of them sees the sheer, monolithic WALL rising up DIRECTLY IN THEIR PATH. 
It's no ordinary wall. It's STU'S PAINTING - the one ALICE found in the closet, the wolf-surgeon canvas from his scary period - 
- and as the bicycle SLAMS INTO IT, it begins to TOPPLE OVER - PINNING STU against the ground underneath! 
STU'S DREAMSCAPE 
No bike. No monkey. Just STU - who finds himself on an operating table, with the world of the painting coming to 3-D life around him. The WOLF- FACED SURGEONS are closing in on him, baring their fangs, brandishing their scalpels and their metallic REPLACEMENT PARTS... 
Suddenly the fabric of this weird reality TEARS - just like a rip in a canvas. A FURRY PAW reaches through - GRABS STU by the hand... 
MONKEYBONE This ain't my nightmare! 
EXT. TRAINYARD - JUST OUTSIDE TUNNEL 
MONKEYBONE PULLS STU through the rip in the back of the giant toppled canvas. The bike's there waiting. They hop aboard and pedal off INTO THE DARK TOWN TUNNEL a split-second before the REAPERS arrive to slice them to ribbons. 
INT. DARK TOWN TUNNEL - ON BICYCLE 
STU pedals so hard his heart is about to burst. He feels down at his side - the yellow pouch containing the E-ticket is still there. The REAPERS are clustered at the mouth of the tunnel, but they aren't following. 
The boys WEEP WITH GLEE. It's a miracle - they've cheated Death! 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. DARK TOWN GATES - NIGHT 
An exhausted STU huffs and puffs as he pedals the bike up the last stretch of track to the platform outside the gates. He climbs off the bike and stares back - it looks like the last thousand miles or so have all been uphill. He slings the YELLOW POUCH over his shoulder... 
STU You saved my life, Monkeybone. I never would've made it without you. 
MONKEYBONE Move it. We got exactly five minutes left. 
STU It's just...now that I'm leaving, I feel like there's lots of things I haven't said. Who's gonna look out for you? Are you gonna be okay when I'm gone? 
MONKEYBONE Oh, don't you worry. I'll be fine. 
STU You've been a hell of a figment, pal. I sure wish I could take you home with me. 
The gates slide open. STU passes through. But MONKEYBONE lingers behind a moment - just long enough for one of the SINGING SPHINXES to slip him a big, nasty BASEBALL BAT. 
MONKEYBONE Awwww. Worried about my feelings, are you? Well, there's a new twist. 
STU Don't joke around, little buddy. I mean it. I really do love y-- 
He turns - and MONKEYBONE MARK McGWIRES HIM upside the head! STU crumples in a heap... 
MONKEYBONE Love you too. Boss. 
Laughing maniacally, MONKEYBONE STEALS the E-TICKET and goes RACING OFF DOWN THE MIDWAY!! 
STU'S HEAD is swimming. It takes him a few seconds, but he gets to his feet. By now, MONKEYBONE is halfway to the E-ticket ride. Worse yet, STU'S WATCH reads 8:59 AM!!! 
STU Stop! Monkeybone! Please!! 
EXT. DARK TOWN PLAZA - NIGHT 
The STREETS ARE LINED with Darktowners ROOTING MONKEYBONE ON as if he's the hometown favorite in a big footrace. Which he is. 
MONKEYBONE reaches the E-TICKET RIDE - drops his E-TICKET into the receptacle at the gate. The drawbridge lowers... 
As STU sprints down the street, the SNAIL MAN oozes into his path - and TRIPS HIM! Before he can get up, cackling DARKTOWNERS converge on him - forcing him back to the ground and HOLDING HIM THERE. 
STU NO! DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?? HE'S GOT MY E-TICKET! HE'S GOT MY - 
HYPNOS Sorry, Stu. It's all part of the deal. We've got big plans for that body of yours! 
EXT. E-TICKET RIDE - ON MONKEYBONE 
The familiar miasma of COLORS is beginning to swirl in the night sky overhead. MONKEYBONE straps on a NEEDLE-TIPPED HELMET which makes him look like a simian DART. Then he climbs into the seat of the TEST-YOUR- STRENGTH machine and braces himself for the big ride! 
EXT. DARK TOWN PLAZA - THAT MOMENT - RIGHT 
ONLOOKERS APPLAUD as the robot lifts its mallet and LETS FLY. DING!! The tiny figure of MONKEYBONE soars toward the swirling colors. His DART- HELMET strikes the black hole dead center. 
He offers STU a box of popcorn soaked in Dr. Pepper. 
STU What is this stuff? 
STEPHEN KING They feed us the slops from the Morpheum Theatre. You hope for Jujubes, settle for goobers. - I'm Steve. Steve King. 
STU Stephen King? What are you doing in here? 
Various OTHERS emerge from the shadows to shake STU's hand. 
JACK THE RIPPER I'm Jack the Ripper. 
TYPHOID MARY Typhoid Mary. 
ATILLA THE HUN Atilla the Hun. Trade you a Twizzler for a box of Raisinets! 
STU Atilla the - ! What in hell is this place? 
As if in reply, a FANFARE sounds in the distance... 
INT. DUNGEON - ENTRANCE 
A RAT GUARD stands at attention by the door, TOOTING HIS KAZOO to announce the arrival of an honored guest. 
RAT GUARD All hail the most glorious! Most eminent! Most esteemed all-powerful God of Sleep...his Royal Lassitude - 
HYPNOS Enough, enough, I'm hung over. 
As HYPNOS passes, the DUNGEON DWELLERS race up to the WALL OF BARS that separates the entry area from the dungeon proper. 
TYPHOID MARY Hyp! Did you bring me the cough medicine? 
STEPHEN KING Did you remember the night light I asked for? 
EDGAR ALLAN POE King, you pussy. 
STEPHEN KING Bite me, Poe! I hate waking up in the dark. 
HYPNOS Sorry, Steve, maybe next time. And how's our new guest settling in - ? 
STU YOU SET ME UP!! 
STU LUNGES at HYPNOS - who backs up just out of reach. 
HYPNOS Easy, pal! I was coming to congratulate you. It ain't easy snatching one of those E-tickets. Steve here was the last guy to pull it off, and that musta been, what, 25 years ago...? 
STU Why'd you do it? What'd I ever do to you?!? 
HYPNOS It's simple, Stu. We need nightmares - lots of 'em. So whenever we can swing it, we send a guy up to stimulate the flow...a nightmare maker! Like Steve here. Poe. Rasputin...we've been doing this all the way back to Atilla and Genghis Khan! 
STU But why me? Why'd you pick on me?? 
HYPNOS The monkey, of course. It was his idea. 
STU Monkeybone...!? 
HYPNOS Nobody wants to be a sidekick, Stu. So one day he comes to us - he's got a proposition. We help him get your body...in return he gives us all the nightmares we want. 
STU You're nuts! I'm a comic strip artist! What's he gonna do - draw really scary cartoons?? 
HYPNOS Oh, no, no, no. Y'see, Stu, as it happens, that girlfriend of yours figured out the chemical basis of bad dreams. And she just whipped up a big old batch of nightmare juice! 
STU's face goes white as he realizes the point of the master plan. 
HYPNOS Oh, we're predicting a record box-office. It's like I always say...nightmares are your best entertainment! 
HYPNOS marches off, chuckling. STU's head sinks into his hands. 
EXT. STU AND JULIE'S HOUSE - DAY 
STU's back from the hospital. JULIE is removing his bags from the trunk of KIMMY's car while STU and KIMMY chat in the front seat. 
KIMMY I just couldn't stand the thought of you suffering. I love you so, I would never have... forgive me, Stu. Please forgive me. 
STU-BONE Kimmy. Chill. We've still got a pact. If anything ever happens to you, I'll be right there to return the favor. (baring his teeth) So drive carefully! From now on. 
STU-BONE Ohhh, nothing. 
She tries to pass, but he grabs the belt of her robe and spins her around. He delicately unwraps the turban, then opens her robe and pulls it closed around the two of them. They kiss... 
JULIE You sure this is...medically advisable? 
STU-BONE Got a doctor on duty. 
JULIE Well. As long as it's okay with Monkeybone - 
STU-BONE almost lets out a gasp of shock. What does she mean??? 
JULIE (glancing downward) 
- which it seems to be. 
STU-BONE does a take. The good news is, she doesn't suspect. The bad news is, he's apparently named after his creator's penis. 
INT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER 
All at once the air is full of Barry White's lush baritone on the bedroom CD player. Through the bedroom doorway we see STU-BONE and JULIE waltzing romantically, belly to belly, still wrapped up in the single robe. 
The only jarring note is BUSTER'S FRANTIC BARKING. The poor dog is stuck behind an accordion gate in the hall, going crazy, trying to warn his mistress about the imposter in STU's body. The dog is almost drowning out Barry White - 
- so STU-BONE stops kissing JULIE long enough to reach over with one foot and KICK THE DOOR SHUT. 
INT. BEDROOM - A MOMENT LATER 
JULIE watches from the bed as STU-BONE begins peeling off his PJ's, going into a bizarrely formalized MONKEY MATING DANCE. He circles back and forth from one side of the bed to the other, making faces, grunting, FEINTING at her occasionally. 
JULIE has some dim sense that this ritual is supposed to be erotic, but in fact, it's making her damned nervous. She finds herself scrunching up on the bed, trying to keep out of STU-BONE's way. 
Now he LEAPS UP onto the foot of the bed. REARS BACK. And with an animal howl of triumph, POUNCES AT JULIE! 
Terrified, she rolls out of the way. STU-BONE'S SKULL slams into the headboard. 
JULIE Oh, God!! Baby! Are you - 
Dazed, he sits up. He tries to stand, but his rubbery legs give way, and he pitches over - CRACKING HIS SKULL AGAIN on the nightstand. 
EXT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER 
JULIE helps a punchdrunk, staggering STU to the stairway. 
STU How was it? I don't recall. 
JULIE It was great, baby. Let's get you to the ER. 
As they pass, BUSTER lets out a little growl of satisfaction from behind his gate. HOLD ON THE DOG's satisfied expression as STU-BONE loses his balance and topples down the stairs O.S. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. DUNGEON - NIGHT 
RASPUTIN, ATILLA, JACK THE RIPPER and STEPHEN KING are engrossed in their weekly Parcheesi game. STU is clinging to the bars, bemoaning his fate. 
STU I'm not like the rest of you. I'm just a regular guy! I'm not a "nightmare maker." 
RASPUTIN Neither are we. We got our bodies hijacked just like you. The guys who replaced us are the nightmare makers! 
ATTILA Like me. I was a mess sergeant in the Mongol Horde. I never wanted to be the Scourge of Asia. I just wanted a new recipe for yak! 
JACK THE RIPPER I was Jack the Haberdasher. 
STU But how? Did you all have sidekicks? Figments? ...Monkeys?? 
STEPHEN KING Hey, I got screwed over by my own dog. Go through hell to get that E-ticket, and who winds up in my body? That darn Cujo. 
TYPHOID MARY runs past, GIGGLING, pursued by a huffing HITCHCOCK. 
RASPUTIN He's sure got a thing for those icy blondes. 
KAZOOS SOUND. The RAT GUARD appears to announce: 
RAT GUARD Miley. You got a visitor. 
JULIE What's this about merchandising? You always hated merchandising! 
STU-BONE Well, baby, I do, but to look at it from another angle...there's a potload of money here. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. STREET - DAY 
SUPERCHARGED POP MUSIC underneath as STU-BONE comes running around a corner - followed, a moment later, by a SCREAMING HORDE of BEAUTIFUL GROUPIES in black miniskirts and high heels. It's like something out of 
A Hard Day's Night, only more so. 
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT 
TIGHT on STU-BONE, head still bandaged, eyes closed, SNORING slightly. He wears a big monkey grin as he DREAMS the above. 
EXT. STREET - DAY 
A CARLOAD OF SUPERMODELS. They kill their engine in the middle of a busy intersection and climb out to join the mob chasing STU-BONE. 
He cuts around a corner, ducks into an alley, and FLATTENS HIMSELF behind a dumpster. As the girls run past, he pulls out a handkerchief and MOPS SWEAT from his brow. 
Then, with a what-the-hell twinkle, he steps out and FLINGS HIS SWEATY HANKIE into the midst of the GROUPIES. A CATFIGHT ensues as they scramble after this precious memento. The chase resumes. 
Suddenly he realizes he's SLOWING DOWN...running in SLO-MO. Same deal with the girls on his trail. After a moment, he FREEZES. He can't move anything except his EYES; he looks right, left, up, down... 
...and suddenly he sees HYPNOS winking into view directly in front of him! HYPNOS is perfectly capable of moving. He strolls right up to the frozen STU-BONE and SLAPS HIM REPEATEDLY, Moe Howard-style. 
HYPNOS You two-bit simian stooge. WHAT THE HELL IS THIS? We didn't send you up here to shake your booty and chase broads. We sent you up to make nightmares!! 
STU-BONE tries to speak. All that comes out is a slo-mo DRAWL. 
HYPNOS Now find that nightmare juice and get to work. 'Cause you may be a free man during the day... but when you dream, your monkey ass is mine! 
He winds up - throws a ROUNDHOUSE PUNCH at STU-BONE'S FACE. 
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT 
STU-BONE sits up suddenly in bed. For a moment he's relieved - it was all a dream. Then he realizes his FACE is swelling like a prizefighter's. His front tooth is loose. BLOOD is streaming from his nose! 
STU-BONE Eep! 
INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT 
He's awake, fully dressed, and fishing around in the pocket of JULIE's topcoat. He finds her KEY RING and tiptoes furtively to the front door. 
STU-BONE Friggin' Hypnos. I'll show him... 
INT. SLEEP LAB - NIGHT 
He unlocks the door and enters the darkened lab. Finds the dispensary area and kneels beside a LOCKED REFRIGERATOR. Then he shuffles through the keys on the ring until he finds one labelled "FRIDGE." 
On the top shelf is a corked beaker of purple fluid bearing the label "ONEIRIX" with red DANGER stickers all over it. STU-BONE takes it out, flashes a sinister grin, and EMPTIES ITS CONTENTS into a similar beaker. Then he refills the original from a hip flask and replaces it. 
He's just about to leave when he's startled by a series of SIMIAN GRUNTS and SQUEAKS - which are TRANSLATED in SUBTITLE: 
FEMALE BABOON Hey, handsome. 
He turns and spots a SEDUCTIVE FEMALE BABOON who's confmed to a CAGE in the corner. The conversation continues in MONKEY TALK. 
FEMALE BABOON Yeah, you. Come here, good-looking. (beat) Why don't you let me out of this cage? 
STU-BONE Hey, I'd love to, baby, but...it'd put me in hot water. 
FEMALE BABOON (caressing his chin) I know how to be very, very grateful. 
He pulls out a MATCHBOOK and scribbles a number on it. 
STU-BONE Tell you what, angel. When you get out, give me a call... 
A LIGHT goes on suddenly in the outside hallway! STU-BONE tries to dive for cover, but the FEMALE BABOON grabs him by the belt and pulls him against the cage. 
Startled, he drops the ONEIRIX BEAKER - which rolls out into the hall! 
INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Say - just a technical question - could you fill these babies up with a particulate solution of one part chemical enzyme to ten parts water? 
BAZOOM EXEC Well - I guess... 
STU-BONE Aww righhhhht! 
He breaks into RIOTOUS LAUGHTER and begins blasting monkeyfarts at HERB and the EXECS, who dive for cover under the conference table. 
EXT. STU AND JULIE'S HOUSE - DAY 
Laughter and back-slapping as STU-BONE walks his guests to their cars. 
STU So here's my idea. We do a giveaway at the zoo benefit. We get a big piñata. We fill it with Monkeybone dolls - hundreds of 'em. 
HERB A piñata. That's a great idea! 
STU-BONE You guys don't know it, but you just saved my ass! 
With a big grin, he pantomimes sticking a thumb up his ass, in obvious imitation of the doll, and then gives the thumbs-up sign. The unnerved EXECS gape at him as he goes back inside - he's developed an odd, loping gait, and his arms swing outward in wide arcs as he walks. 
BURGER GOD EXEC Interesting fellow. 
HERB Head trauma. 
INT. STU'S KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT 
He digs around under the sink, finds the purple beaker of ONEIRIX. Looks at the FARTING DOLL...and GRINS. 
STU-BONE This'll get him off my back! 
INSERT - TV SCREEN 
A PROMO for the MONKEYBONE cartoon show. MONKEYBONE swings across the screen on a vine, followed by a string of grinning, live-action FANS doing a scratch 'n' sniff, pull-out-a-plum LINE DANCE. 
ANNOUNCER It's his world - we just live in it. Monkeybone! Back with six all-new episodes, starting - 
INT. LIVING ROOM - REVERSE ANGLE - NIGHT 
A distraught JULIE mutes the TV. Her friend ALICE is on the sofa beside her, having coffee and dessert. 
JULIE The thing is, I'm responsible for the way he's acting. It's the nightmare juice. It's got to be. 
ALICE Julie, that stuff probably saved his life. 
JULIE I can't explain this, Alice, but I'm not so sure it did. It's as if...he's not Stu any more. The Stu I love is gone! (beat) 
He spends all his time in the garage. He says he's...autographing. 
INT. GARAGE - NIGHT 
TIGHT ON the flask of ONEIRIX as STU-BONE picks it up. 
He's wearing a GAS MASK. He's rigged a CLOTHESLINE in the garage. MONKEYBONE DOLLS are clipped to it, ass-end up - forming a makeshift ASSEMBLY LINE. He dips a TURKEY BASTER into the flask...withdraws a quantity of purple fluid...plucks the FINGER out of the first doll's behind... 
- and plunges the TURKEY BASTER into the doll's hindquarters, filling it with ONEIRIX!! The doll's buttocks take on the purple hue characteristic of Orangutans in heat. STU-BONE holds the doll at arm's length and pulls its finger - launching a purple puff of SPIKED NIGHTMARE GAS. 
STU-BONE Yeah, baby! Nightmare-in-a-butt! (looking around) Okay...guinea pig, guinea pig... 
EXT. GARAGE/BACK YARD - NIGHT 
STU-BONE steps out into the driveway and hears a low growl - BUSTER is giving him the stinkeye from behind the picket fence. STU-BONE's eyes light up with inspiration. 
STU-BONE C'mere, boy...c'mere, ole buddy... 
INT. LIVING ROOM - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT 
LOUD BARKING outside. JULIE wanders over toward the window. 
ALICE Listen. Let's bring him in for some tests. I guarantee you're overreacting. 
JULIE lifts the curtain - and sees STU-BONE in his gas mask, bent over in a weird crab like stance, chasing BUSTER around the yard with the Monkeybone doll. 
JULIE doesn't seem especially surprised - but ALICE's mouth falls open. 
JULIE Actually, no, I don't think I'm overreacting. 
She looks up at him, feline eyes aglow. There's a three-foot-long RODENT'S TAIL dangling out of her mouth. 
STU I'll really...never...forget you. 
He races off as KITTY resumes her feast. The sound of fighting has roused the other DUNGEON DWELLERS, and when they realize the dungeon door is open they come rushing out en masse. 
Then the PANEL opens. They hear FOOD raining down behind them. HITCHCOCK is the first to turn back - then STEPHEN KING - then ATILLA. A moment later they're back to their old habits, climbing over one another to get at a half-empty box of Raisinets. 
WIPE TO: 
INT. SLEEP LAB - DAY 
The usual gang sitting around at their computer terminals, etc. JULIE is coolly reading NOTEBOOK ENTRIES into a TAPE RECORDER. 
JULIE "4/17: Subject, when unaware of observation, prefers to hold eating utensils...with feet. Successfully carves turkey roll holding eating utensils...with feet." 
ALICE They had a case like that at Johns Hopkins. Wires got crossed between hands and feet. 
CLARISSA Great lead. I'll try and find it on the net. 
JULIE "4/18: Subject climbs backyard tree...to perform elimination. When confronted with product... blames it on family dog." 
DEAD SILENCE from the mortified group. They never had a case like that at Johns Hopkins. JULIE somehow keeps a stiff upper lip - deeply embarrassed for STU, but a scientist nonetheless. 
HUTCH Seems perfectly obvious. He's been possessed by a monkey! 
The others all GLOWER at HUTCH for this egregious display of bad taste. 
EXT. GARAGE - AFTERNOON 
STU-BONE and HERB are standing outside the garage in formal attire as a crew of ZOO WORKERS load MONKEYBONE DOLLS into a pickup. 
HERB You're really gonna pop the question? 
STU-BONE Got the ring. Got the airline tickets. Soon as they break that piñata, we'll grab a cab - and it's off to the land of palm trees and coconuts. 
HERB I can't believe you. You used to hate being the center of attention. Now you're proposing, in public, at a benefit. 
STU-BONE Yeah, I was thinking...I mean, I'm a celebrity now, do I really want to get married? But on the other hand, if you're married, they can't testify against you. 
HERB wonders if this is a joke, decides it is, and forces a chuckle. 
INT. BEDROOM - DAY 
JULIE is getting dressed for the benefit when the PHONE RINGS. 
JULIE Hello? Oh, Hutch - what? 
INTERCUT - JULIE AND HUTCH 
HUTCH is at the sleep lab, standing over the open refrigerator. 
HUTCH The Nightmare Juice! It's gone! Somebody switched it for a beaker of grape Kool-Aid!! 
JULIE Kool-Aid!? But who'd would want to - 
Her eyes move to the WINDOW - to STU-BONE out by the garage. 
JULIE Okay. Call the police. I'll be right over. 
INT. SLEEP LAB - LATE AFTERNOON 
Two DETECTIVES examining the scene of the crime. 
JULIE The technical name is Oneirix. It's an enzyme. It's present in the brains of - 
DETECTIVE (cutting her off; writing) Yeah, yeah...Nightmare juice. 
DETECTIVE II And there's been no sign of a break-in? 
HUTCH Holy shit...the pants. (remembering) The janitor found a pair of torn-up pants. It was the same night the monkey tipped her cage over. Remember that, Julie? 
JULIE (suddenly afraid) Yeah...I remember it vividly. 
EXT. ZOO - DAY 
LEAD SURGEON I think it can still be saved. Put it on ice. 
EXT. ZOO - DAY 
GUESTS are beginning to arrive for the benefit. In the cages and habitats, animals stare up at a gigantic MONKEYBONE BALLOON. 
EXT. ZOO - ANOTHER ANGLE - DAY 
The BAZOOM TOY REP is rounding a corner when HERB pops out from behind a tree and BLASTS HIM with a jolt of purple gas from a Monkeybone doll! He sputters and coughs... 
Then he grabs the doll away and blasts HERB right back! The two of them chase each other around the tree, giggling. The BAZOOM REP'S WIFE, in her formal gown, affects a look of supreme mortification. 
EXT. STU'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY 
O.D. STU climbs over the fence, finds a hidden key, and lets himself in. 
INT. HOUSE - STUDIO - DAY 
O.D. STU rushes frantically from room to room. 
O.D. STU (o.s.) DOC? DOC?? - JULIE? 
No reply - the joint's empty. O.D. STU enters the studio and spots a NEWSPAPER on his drafting table. The paper is folded back to a big DISPLAY AD for the benefit: "MEET STU MILEY AND MONKEYBONE - 8 PM TONIGHT!" He checks the wall clock: time is short. 
Reaching into the drawer of the drafting table, he pulls out a TACKLE BOX which contains old brushes...and a small VELVET BOX. O.D. STU opens the velvet box to reveal Grandma's ANTIQUE RING. 
He hears GROWLING behind him - it's BUSTER. The dog looks up, cocks his head - and begins WAGGING HIS TAIL. Somehow, even though STU's in a different body, BUSTER recognizes him. 
EXT. STU AND JULIE'S HOUSE - DAY 
O.D. STU exits, ring in hand. Behind him, BUSTER is throwing a fit - barking, FLINGING himself at the screen door. He wants to come along! 
A BUS pulls up at the corner, and O.D. STU boards it. BUSTER throws everything he's got at the door - and it gives! He takes off after STU. 
EXT. ZOO - GROUNDS - DAY 
As HERB is walking toward the refreshment table, an ODD LOOK crosses his face. All at once he begins to TUG at his collar. He yanks his TIE off ...doffs his JACKET onto the pavement... 
POV HERB - PSYCHO-VISION 
The nightmare drug is kicking in! The whole zoo SWIMS around him. All at once he's being ATTACKED...by a HORDE of EMPTY CLOTHES!! 
EXT. ZOO - GROUNDS - DAY 
JULIE has arrived at the zoo. She's wandering zombie-like through the food court, flanked by her friends ALICE and CLARISSA. 
JULIE Whatever he's done, I'm responsible for it. 
CLARISSA That's not true, Julie. It's not true. 
ALICE This is not about your guilt, Julie. There could be innocent people in danger. 
CLARISSA He's not the same guy. He's not your Stu. (beat) I didn't want to tell you this, but the other day he pinched me on the butt. 
ALICE I didn't want to tell you this, but the other day he tried to mount me from behind! Look, you have to tell the police. 
JULIE Tell them what? I don't know anything concrete. All I have is a feeling. 
All of a sudden, they hear SHOUTS and LAUGHTER from the area of the reptile house. In the distance, ZOO SECURITY GUARDS are chasing a NAKED MAN through the crowds of formally-dressed partygoers. 
CLARISSA Oh my God, we've got a flasher. 
JULIE That...that's Herb! 
The GUARDS catch hold of HERB and drag him away past JULIE, ALICE, and CLARISSA. He doesn't recognize any of them. He's PSYCHOTIC: 
HERB CLOTHES! Beware of clothes. They're working together. All of them. Shirts...pants... ENSEMBLES...! 
The three women exchange looks of stupefied HORROR. 
INT. MUNI BUS - LATE AFTERNOON 
PASSENGERS are holding their noses, frantically pulling on the BELL ROPE to alert the driver that they want off. As we move toward the back we see O.D. STU sitting alone, with rows of empty seats on either side. 
He looks rough. He's bone-white, his taped-up lab coat is crusted with blood, and he never did find any shoes. Also, it's a hot night and he's starting to get a little ripe. FLIES are buzzing all around him. 
GUEST HEY MONKEYBONE!! 
STU-BONE turns and does a simian COMEDY SHTICK for the crowd. 
STU-BONE That's me, folks! Monkeybone! Let's party! 
By the time he's done scratching his ribs, JULIE has vanished! 
EXT. ZOO GROUNDS - LATE AFTERNOON 
She races out of the tent - grabs a passing ZOO GUARD. 
JULIE Please. Where did you take that man...? 
The GUARD points to an ANIMAL CONTROL VAN. JULIE sees O.D. STU peering out through a small barred panel. Their eyes meet... 
JULIE Who are you? Why did you say those things? 
O.D. STU Oh, Doc, it's all a mixup. We were in the land of death. He stole my e-ticket. That's how he got my body, see? All they had left for me was this corpse! 
JULIE digests this, nods professionally, and turns to walk away. 
O.D. STU Don't walk away, Doc! He's only here to give people nightmares! (no response) 
Doc! Please! Don't you remember the dream? They were pulling the plug - I called out to you - and you heard me. Remember? 
This stops JULIE cold. Her spine is tingling. She turns slowly, a single tear rolling down her cheek. And then... 
JULIE BUSTER?!? 
The dog runs right past JULIE and bounds up to the animal control van, barking his head off. Now JULIE is starting to believe. She turns - 
JULIE Stu...how? 
O.D. STU I had to come back, Julie. I had to give you this. 
THROUGH THE BARS he hands her the little box containing Grandma's antique ring. 
O.D. STU I meant to give it to you before. The night we crashed. I was so happy, Julie, I...try to remember me like that, okay? Not like this. 
She slips the ring on her finger - looks up at O.D. STU with TEARS WELLING in her eyes. He makes an odd SNORKELING kind of noise. 
JULIE What's wrong? 
O.D. STU I'm crying too. I just don't have any tears. I'm all dried up. 
JULIE TURNS. The two DETECTIVES we saw in the sleep lab have just arrived at the gate, and ALICE and CLARISSA are leading them over. 
ALICE Detective, please let this man out of the van. 
EXT. ZOO GROUNDS - PIÑATA AREA - THAT MOMENT 
The PARTYGOERS are lined up under the gigantic Stanley-shaped PIÑATA, which is hanging from a tree. A TUBBY BANKER in a blindfold takes a good hard whack. CRACKS are beginning to appear... 
STU-BONE Okay, folks, it's piñata time - you know the rules - five bucks a pop - and remember, it's all for the benefit of our friends the animals! (eyes brightening) Oooooh! This one's on me! 
The next contestant is a GORGEOUS WOMAN. He blindfolds her and embraces her from behind to help her with her grip on the bat. 
STU-BONE Choke up, baby. That's right. Choke up! 
Suddenly he notices the COPS marching up with JULIE, O.D. STU and co. in tow. He freezes, terrified - BACKS AWAY from the BABE - 
- and catches a BAT IN THE FACE. Several people rush up to help him as the COPS consult with the BENEFIT ORGANIZERS... 
ORGANIZER I don't understand, officer. This is a benefit. Surely this can wait until - 
COP Sorry, ma'am...we need to question Mr. Miley on a most urgent matter. 
JULIE Stop this. Now. Those dolls have been tampered with. They're toxic! 
O.D. STU comes marching through the crowd. He passes a LIFE-SIZED DISPLAY of Stanley and Monkeybone...GRABS THE BACKPACK off the Stanley figure...and proceeds deliberately toward STU-BONE. 
O.D. STU MONKEYBONE...BACK IN THE PACK. 
The old command seems to retain its magical power, because STU-BONE clutches his gut as if stricken at the sound of it. 
It lands close enough to the FENCE that one of the SURGEONS thinks he can reach it. He reaches through the bars and sees a pack of BENGAL TIGERS racing toward him! He manages to grab ONE END of the liver - but a TIGER gets the other end - 
- and it's a TUG-OF-WAR until the tiger BITES the liver in half, sending the terrified SURGEON sprawling on the pavement outside the bars! The HEAD SURGEON examines the remaining half-liver... 
HEAD SURGEON Put it on ice. I think it can still be saved. 
ANGLE ON BALLOON 
STU-BONE socks O.D. STU hard across the face! He lets go of his incision ...and his SMALL INTESTINE falls out! Since it's still connected at both ends, the intestine forms a great big LOOP... 
EXT. FOOD COURT - SERVING TABLE - LATE AFTERNOON 
The SERVER has just brought out a new PUNCHBOWL full of nice clean punch. He sets it down on the table and is about to ladle out a cupful when STU flies past overhead. His intestinal LOOP slides across the table, knocking over glasses, snagging the PUNCHBOWL at its base... 
...and YANKING IT right off the table! Bystanding GUESTS are DRENCHED in punch as the punch bowl FLIES END OVER END... 
...and, with the sound of a GONG being struck, BEANS a member of the SURGICAL TEAM from behind!! Naturally it's the guy who's lugging the ICE CHEST full of O.D. STU's organs. When the punchbowl strikes, he GOES DOWN HARD, PITCHING the ice chest... 
... at a pair of COPS who are over by the piñata, loading CONFISCATED MONKEYBONE DOLLS into a SHOPPING CART. The ICE CHEST knocks them off their feet - and sends the SHOPPING CART rolling downhill! 
The COPS try to get up, but they skid every which way on the SPILLED ICE underneath. On top of which, the SURGICAL TEAM is all over them, playing GRAB-ASS with the COPS as they try to retrieve precious organs. 
The HEAD SURGEON kneels beside his fallen comrade, the guy who got BEANED by the punchbowl, and feels for a pulse. 
HEAD SURGEON Put him on ice. I think he can still be saved! 
EXT. ZOO GROUNDS - LATE AFTERNOON 
COPS sprint downhill, trying to intercept the runaway SHOPPING CART full of confiscated dolls. Too late. The CART slams into a fence and goes ass-over-teakettle, dumping its contents into the PENGUIN HABITAT... 
INT. HYP'S HIDEAWAY - THAT MOMENT 
HYPNOS and an audience of DARKTOWNERS peer into the nightmare orb. They see a Keystone-Cops vision of fur-clad ESKIMOS, with clubs and spearguns, amid a colony of terrified PENGUINS. 
HYPNOS Not again. THAT STINKING MONKEY!!! 
AERIAL SHOT - STU'S POV - MOVING 
STU gets an idea as he looks down at his dangling INTESTINE. He begins FEEDING IT OUT - giving himself more rope to work with - and when it's long enough, begins SWINGING IT like a LASSO! 
EXT. WATER BUFFALO HABITAT - LATE AFTERNOON 
WATER BUFFALO graze Buddha-like as STU'S INTESTINE snags one of them around the HORNS. The lasso draws taut - and holds! 
ANGLE ON BALLOON - O.D. STU AND STU-BONE 
The balloon is moored in place again! O.D. STU pulls himself upward, toward STU-BONE, who KICKS AT him frantically! 
EXT. ZOO GROUNDS - LATE AFTERNOON 
A COP pulls his sidearm and TAKES AIM at the now-stabilized balloon. 
COP I think I can bring 'em down. 
ANGLE ON BALLOON - MOVING - LATE AFTERNOON 
BLAM! The cop's shot hits the giant MONKEYBONE BALLOON smack in the ass. With a gale-force helium FART, the balloon ZOOMS UPWARD. The INTESTINE snaps. STU-BONE and O.D. STU shoot off into the air! 
ON STU-BONE & O.D. STU - AERIAL 
AT APOGEE. They exchange a LOOK as the last gasp of helium hisses out of the gigantic balloon. Then it occurs to them to look DOWN... 
THEIR POV - PARKING LOT - OVERHEAD ANGLE 
...at the tiny CARS parked far, far below. They must be close to a hundred feet up in the air - and all at once the ground is coming up fast! 
EXT. ZOO - ON JULIE & CROWD - LATE AFTERNOON 
JULIE et al SCREAM IN HORROR as the two bodies plunge earthward. 
ON STU-BONE & O.D. STU - FALLING 
...and falling and falling until they SMACK INTO the hot asphalt of the parking lot, the deflated balloon settling over them like a shroud. 
Their BODIES have stopped - but their SPIRITS keep on falling...

NINJA ASSASSIN 
Written by 
Matthew Sand & J. Michael Straczynski 
REVISED 2nd DRAFT   6/4/08 
FADE IN: 
CLOSE ON a Horimono Tattoo as it is being drawn into flesh. The ink is needled into the surface of the skin, raw and bloody, the needled brush tapped with the precision of ritual. 
The tattoo is in the style of a Kuniyoshi print: Miyamoto Musashi thrusting his spear into the writhing dragon. The image has beauty but retains the violence required to saturate flesh with art. 
The skin canvas shifts uncomfortably with the needle- work. 
HOLLYWOOD Fuck!   Fucking-shit-fuck-fucking- fuck! 
PULL BACK to reveal that we're in... 
1   INT. TATTOO PARLOR - NIGHT                                      1 
A place of designer furniture, beautiful girls carrying towels, tea and cigarettes. Dozens of Yakuza look on as the process continues, sleeves rolled up or shirts off to expose the lavish tattoos that cover their torsos. 
HOLLYWOOD, the young Yakuza member, is getting his first tattoo, a relatively small one on his back. 
He grabs a bottle of sake and suckles it like a baby. 
HOLLYWOOD Watch it, old man! 
The old tattoo artist continues tapping his brush.       Maybe a little harder. 
HOLLYWOOD (CONT'D) What the fuck?     You're doing it wrong. 
TATTOO ARTIST The needle is doing what the needle does. 
HOLLYWOOD What's that supposed to mean?

TATTOO MASTER The irezumi does not hide the skin, the tattoo reveals the nature of the man and illuminates the four noble professions in the Book of Five Rings: the Warrior, the Artist, the Merchant, and the farmer. If there is a conflict between the needle and the skin, between the mark and the man, then perhaps the path you have chosen is not the path for which you are suited. 
HOLLYWOOD What did you just say, old man? 
Hollywood whips his gun out and jams it under the old man's jaw. 
HOLLYWOOD (CONT'D) I know you didn't just disrespect me, did you? You that fucking stupid? You disrespect me, and I'll tattoo this ceiling with your fucking brains! 
The old man speaks with a kind of deference honed through years of service to men like Hollywood. 
TATTOO MASTER No disrespect. 
Hollywood smiles. 
HOLLYWOOD You're lucky. I can't kill you 'til you finish this thing. Gimme that mirror! How's it looking? 
Goons and girls all cluck their tongues in chorus. Hollywood peers at the new tat through the mirror.         He whistles approval as Yakuza One enters carrying an origami envelope. 
HOLLYWOOD (CONT'D) Not bad. Not bad. For an old fuck. 
YAKUZA ONE Hey, boss. This just came for you. 
HOLLYWOOD What is it?

YAKUZA ONE A letter. 
HOLLYWOOD So open it, dumb ass. 
He opens the origami envelope, then hesitates at what he sees. 
HOLLYWOOD (CONT'D) What?   What is it? 
He pours the contents out into his hand. 
YAKUZA ONE Looks like sand. 
He tastes it. 
YAKUZA ONE (CONT'D) Yup. Sand. Black Sand. 
The tattoo master drops his brush.     It clatters to the floor. 
TATTOO MASTER No... 
MIKA You remember the Eulmi incident?                    *

MASLOW Korean queen, late eighteen-                         * hundred's. According to you, she was off'd by one of these ninja clans. 
MIKA Ozunu. I think. I've been going through some of the original transcripts of the trial of Kunitomo Shigeaki. The prosecutor questioned him about a payment of 100 pounds of gold. Shigeaki answered that he didn't know what the prosecutor was talking about. The question was never brought up again. But what pinged for me was the amount- the exact same amount rumored to be paid to the Hattori Clan for the assassination of Lord Sanda. 
MASLOW So you start to wonder, in this ever changing world, if the cost of a man's life has remained constant. 
MIKA Exactly. I figure these clans are like a thousand years old. They probably don't change a lot. 
She begins flipping through huge reams of bank records. 
MIKA (CONT'D) I started looking at international wire transfers, targeting banks in the regions of several high- profile assassinations and bingo- 
The proverbial needle in a haystack; a single wire transfer circled in red. 
MIKA (CONT'D) Minister Zhang. The day before the assassination $1,555,999.90 was transferred from the bank of Shanghai. The exact market value of one hundred pounds of gold. 
MASLOW Highly circumstantial.                               * 
(CONTINUED) GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT   6/4/08     12. 11   CONTINUED: (2)                                              11 
MIKA I thought you might say that so I checked how often this particular bank transferred that market equivalent to a hundred pounds of gold in the last three years. 
MASLOW Let me guess. 
MIKA Not once. 
He sifts through the report.                                      * 
MASLOW Okay you got me. This is                                * interesting.                                            * 
MIKA The clans are real, Ryan. They                          * steal children and turn them into                       * assassins. They've been doing it                        * for years and nobody's doing a                          * damn thing to stop them.                                * 
MASLOW Look, no one's denying the historical record, Mika. But the whole idea just doesn't fit in with a modern world. It's like one of those questions on an IQ test: which of these doesn't belong in this sentence: laptops, space shuttles, nanotechnology, ninjas. 
MIKA They're real Ryan. You can call them spooks, or assassins, or whatever you want if it makes you feel better, but they're out there. They're killing people and nobody is doing a damn thing to stop them.

12    INT. ISTANBUL LAUNDROMAT - NIGHT                          12 
Close on tokens being rammed down the mechanical throat of a washing machine. Overhead, the fluorescent lights STROBE unevenly, the fixtures old and in need of new bulbs. 
Raizo steps back as the washer begins to cycle loudly, a wheezbox instrument that rattles, gurgles and groans. 
As he looks at the machine we hear: 
OZUNU Our enemies are everywhere. 
12A   FLASHBACK - INT. ORPHANAGE - DAY                         12A 
Ozunu strides among his children who are bathing, scrubbing themselves with evergreens. 
OZUNU You must move without trace or                       * footprint. 
Young Raizo pours water through evergreens onto clothes he is scrubbing. 
OZUNU (CONT'D) You must become shadow; Your scent                   * nothing but wind through trees.                      * 
BACK TO: 
12B   INT. ISTANBUL LAUNDROMAT - NIGHT                         12B 
A pretty young Japanese woman, the only other customer, calls to Raizo as she stands beside one of the dryers. 
PRETTY WOMAN Hi... excuse me...? (catches his eye) Would you mind? 
RAIZO ...sorry? 
She hands him one end of a freshly dried sheet. 
PRETTY WOMAN If it's not too much trouble, could you help me with this? 
He smiles and nods. (CONTINUED) GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT    6/4/08   13A. 12B   CONTINUED:                                                 12B 
They begin to fold, corner to corner, end to end. Silently. The fluorescent strobing above them. 
We sense a strange tension between them as we realize they are alone in the midnight cleaners. He looks at her. She smiles. The uneven strobing on either side of the Laundromat casts uneven shadows on her face... almost as though she had two faces. One light, one shadow. We EXTEND the silence for a long BEAT until he looks down at the sheet and says: 
RAIZO What clan are you from? 
She glances up sharply. 
MASLOW No idea- 
He finishes his soda and takes his garbage to the can. 
MASLOW (CONT'D) But I can guarantee you that it has nothing to do with the fact that you're the most attractive researcher that I've ever worked with. 
He smiles and turns before she flushes a bright shade of red. 
16   INT. ISTANBUL RAIZO'S APARTMENT - DAY                       16 
A teapot begins to sing. 
Raizo pours the boiling water into a plastic bowl of noodles. He covers the bowl and waits a moment for the soup to cook. 
As he stares, we hear. (CONTINUED) GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT     6/4/08   17. 16   CONTINUED:                                                   16 
OZUNU (V.O.) The body must obey the will.                         * 
17   FLASHBACK - INT. ORPHANAGE KITCHEN/DINING ROOM - DAY         17 
Several of the younger members of the clan are sitting at the table, about to eat. 
Ozunu stands before them. He removes a small blade from inside his robe. Places the blade against his palm. 
OZUNU Hunger and thirst, your bowels and                   * breath, even the blood in your                       * veins, are the body's weaknesses.                    * 
The knife slices down along his palm, opening a split; the flesh parts, yet no blood flows. 
OZUNU (CONT'D) Master them, and you master the self. 
He closes his fist. 
OZUNU (CONT'D) This is the power of the Ozunu clan. 
He concentrates, squeezing his hand tightly until he opens it revealing that the wound has closed. 
OZUNU (CONT'D) This is the way of the ninja. 
The children look at each other, except for Raizo who stares at Ozunu. 
OZUNU (CONT'D) Eat tonight and you work twice as                    * hard tomorrow. 
Ozunu leaves. 
The children look at the soup, their mouths watering. All around, the older Ozunu clan members eat noisily. One of the children can't resist any longer and begins scooping up the noodles. In short order, others do the same. 
(CONTINUED) GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT    6/4/08   18. 17    CONTINUED:                                                  17 
All except for Raizo, who sets down his chopsticks. Willing himself not to be hungry. 
17A   BACK TO SCENE                                              17A 
The grown Raizo looks at his soup.    We cannot tell if he is going to eat or not. 
OZUNU The world feeds on the weak. 
18    FLASHBACK - INT. ORPHANAGE OZUNU HOUSE - NIGHTINGALE        18 FLOOR - NIGHT 
Young Raizo stands in the central chamber of the compound. The floor beneath his bare feet is made of thousands of carefully mitred pieces of gleaming wood laid down in an intricate pattern. They are not, however, glued down to the floor. The slightest wrong move will make them shift noisily. 
This is our first look at the Nightingale Floor. 
OZUNU Suffering exists only because                       * weakness exists. 
Ozunu watches from the far side of the room as Raizo takes his first step. Carefully. Graceful as any dancer. 
He makes no sound. 
OZUNU (CONT'D) You must hate all weakness. Hate                    * it in others, but most of hate it                   * in yourself. 
He takes another step, and another.    Each soft as a falling feather. 
He is a third of the way across the floor - his body gleaming with sweat - when he steps wrong and the floor sings beneath him. 
Raizo stops, a flash of panic in his eyes. Then he subdues the emotion and obediently lifts the offending foot, holds it out as Ozunu rises and approaches. 
Ozunu lays open Raizo's foot with a bamboo rod.      Slashing blows that leave deep cuts. 
(CONTINUED) GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT   6/4/08   18A. 18   CONTINUED:                                              18 
Raizo's expression hardly changes. Ozunu returns to his place, and Raizo starts walking again, making no noise, and leaving no trace of his passage... 
...except for a trail of small, bloody footprints. 
19   FLASHBACK - INT. ORPHANAGE DORMITORY - NIGHT            19 
She stares at the fierce beauty of his face and touches the screen gently. 
22Aa   INT. ISTANBUL RAIZO'S APARTMENT - DAY                   22Aa 
CLOSE on a bed of nails; sixteen penny nails arranged in perfect rows pointing up, the sharp tips catching the light. 
As we REVEAL Raizo his breathing is rhythmic and deep, but this is really the first time we have heard him sound like he is straining. 
As we continue to WIDEN, we discover the reason for this: he is doing handstand push-ups. On the nails. Over and over, with little apparent effort. 
The hard edges and lines of his body catch the light, like the tips of the nails, as we HEAR: 
OZUNU (V.O.) Strength is the only virtue that nature respects. 
22Ab   FLASHBACK - INT. ORPHANAGE - DAY                        22Ab 
Children are sharpening their weapons. Ozunu walks above them. 
OZUNU Hone your body. Sharpen your mind. Become the weapon you will need to survive. 
Young Raizo looks up and sees young Kiriko looking at him. She smiles. He looks back to his weapon. 
22B    EXT. ISTANBUL - STREET - DAY                             22B 
Raizo walks down a street where repair work is being done. To keep cars from falling into the hole, they've covered the street with big steel plates. As the cars and trucks pass over the plates, they make a bump-thump sound. Bump-thump, bump-thump, bump-thump. We PUSH IN on Raizo under that sound. GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT    6/4/08   22A. 
23   FLASHBACK - EXT. ORPHANAGE BONSAI GARDEN - DAY            23 
Kiriko is working in the bonsai garden. Raizo watches her silently for a moment noticing that she is secretly loosening the wires, letting the branches ease back into their natural shape. 
He whispers. 
RAIZO You shouldn't do that. It's against the rules. If they catch you -- 
KIRIKO Then they catch me. 
RAIZO They'll put you in the box. 
KIRIKO Yes, they will. 
She finishes releasing the branch. 
KIRIKO (CONT'D) I believe the heart of the tree knows which way it needs to grow. 
RAIZO Trees don't have hearts. 
KIRIKO Everything has a heart.

RAIZO I don't. 
There's sadness and bitterness in his eyes. He's closing off to the world, becoming what they want. She won't let that happen. 
KIRIKO Really? Let me see. 
He hesitates, then approaches. Kneels down beside her. She reaches toward him. He flinches...a sword he can handle, but kindness has become something foreign...then allows her to undo the top button of his shirt. She presses her ear to his chest. Listens. 
Then she gently whispers to it. 
KIRIKO (CONT'D) Hello....hello, you in there. 
She listens again. 
KIRIKO (CONT'D) It's saying hello back. And that it's happy to meet me...but it misses you. 
Raizo smiles despite himself. 
RAIZO Liar. 
KIRIKO Listen to mine, I'm not lying. I'll prove it. 
Again, he hesitates. Then he leans in, and listens to her heart. Bump-thump. Bump-thump. She smiles. 
KIRIKO (CONT'D) Hello.

He looks up at her, his ear still to her chest. And for the first time, his face softens. Bump-thump. Bump- thump. Bump-thump. 
23A   BACK TO SCENE                                               23A 
In the present as the traffic bounces past Raizo.        Bump- thump. Bump-thump. Bump-thump. 
His eyes saddening with memory, he continues on his way. 
OZUNU (CONT'D) This is your first test. Survive                    * the night. 
He signals to the rest of the clan and they all begin to leave. 
Kiriko is the last to turn away. 
TIME CUT: 
Later.    Night. 
Raizo is still where we left him, a twisted knot of pain, his face stained with tears and crusted with snot. 
He is trying to control his breath, at first without success. Then slowly, finally, it begins to ease. His hand, twisted into a kind of rigor mortis, slowly begins to relax, opening like a lotus flower. 
TIME CUT: 
Dawn breaks over the wall, as Ozunu returns to the dojo to find Raizo is sitting in a full lotus, completely calm, the wound already beginning to heal. 
Ozunu shows a hint of a smile. 
OZUNU (CONT'D) Very good, Raizo. Very good.

MASLOW I don't understand what is really going on, but I'm smart enough to recognize a warning when I see one. 
MIKA But why? 
MASLOW Why? It's obvious. If your little fantasy has even slightest chance of being real, then these Nine Clans would have some pretty major juice protecting them. 
MIKA What are you going to do? 
MASLOW We are going to tip-toe, very carefully from here on out. You understand? You don't do anything else without checking with me. Got it? 
She nods. 
MIKA Did you find Sabatin yet?

Maslow isn't sure he wants to answer her. 
MIKA (CONT'D) You did. 
MASLOW Yeah...he's dead. 
MIKA How? 
MASLOW Heart attack. 
MIKA They killed him. 
MASLOW People die of heart attacks, Mika. 
MIKA Was he married? Did he have a family? 
MASLOW God, you are relentless, aren't you. 
MIKA I know you Ryan, you would have checked. 
MASLOW A wife. 
MIKA Still in Russia? 
MASLOW Relocated. 
MIKA Where? 
Ozunu nods in appreciation. 
Raizo nods back, as if he can see without eyes. 
35   FLASHBACK - INT. ORPHANAGE DORMITORY - NIGHT                 35 
Young Raizo, still blindfolded is in bed. Trying to sleep, but it's impossible. Takeshi's snoring doesn't help. 
He turns slightly towards Kiriko, as her chest rises and falls, her breath as rhythmic as and gentle as the lap of sea-water in a tidal pool. He begins to breathe in sync with her, perhaps in hopes it will relax him. 
Slowly, all the other sounds in the room go away, until only her breathing, and his, remains. There is the slight murmur of their hearts. 
Then she opens her eyes...and smiles at him because he cannot see her. But he hears her heart begin to beat faster and that brings a faint smile to his lips. 
They listen to each other's breathing growing heavier, the sound of their hearts beating faster and faster. 
Her lips part as she makes the tiniest movement...tilting her pelvis up, rubbing her hips ever so slightly against the blanket- 
It's like tectonic plates shifting for Raizo. 
Bump-thump, bump-thump, bump-thump their hearts growing louder and louder as they become-

Sabatin and Mika sit across from each other. The house has the chill of loneliness. Tea has been set out between them. 
MRS. SABATIN You said you read my husband's report, yes? What did you think? 
MIKA I found it...illuminating. Especially the references to the Rihla. Your husband quotes passages not found in Battuta's present manuscript. 
MRS. SABATIN My husband journeyed all over the world researching that report, but when he was home, he never spoke about it. He said it was safer that way. 
MIKA I understand the report caused some problems for him inside the KGB. 
MRS. SABATIN The report caused "problems" for Alexei's career the way Moses caused problems for the Pharaoh, you see? Very unpleasant. Terrible people saying terrible things. 
She pours tea, the harsh memories still fresh.

MRS. SABATIN (CONT'D) After he retired...was asked to retire...we moved, first to Byelorussia and then here to Berlin when the wall came down. He said this will be a good place to grow old together. And it was, for a time. 
MIKA What happened? 
She looks off, shakes her head. 
MRS. SABATIN About two years ago...two? Yes, after the assassination of Zhukov, the report drew attention. After that, everything was different.

As Alexei supervises, workmen install locks, put in fencing material, hang lights and video cameras on the outside of the house. 
MRS. SABATIN (V.O.) Alexei hired men to change all the locks, and put in more of them. Locks on the windows, locks on the doors, locks on the locks. He put in cameras and motion sensors and lights...everywhere, lights. 
The lights SNAP on, illuminating the back of the house with brilliant klieg lights.

39    FLASHBACK - INT/EXT. SABATIN HOUSE - DAY                     39 
We are over the shoulder of someone who could be Raizo or Takeshi as the door opens revealing Alexei. 
She opens it. 
Inside are a series of cataloged photographs taken in the style of 1970's archeologists (like those of the dead sea scrolls) of the lost chapter of Ibn-Battuta. 
The scrolls contain his 14th century Islamic writing and several sketches.

There is also a very rough map that suggests the location of The Orphanage. 
Images of the orphanage, of the children training and their ordeals, bloody combat, ritual bindings, beatings on the Nightingale floor. 
There is a scroll that she unrolls revealing the lineage tree of the Nine Clans. 
Also in the box is a single VHS tape. 
She pushes the tape into the player. 
It's a recording of a surveillance camera staring at the front of the Sabatin house. 
A man walks up to the house and rings's the bell. We cannot see his face. Sabatin opens the door. They exchange words. Sabatin seems wary but invites the man in. 
Mika doesn't understand why this is significant. 
She hits fast forward until she sees a flash as the man exits. She stops, rewinds and plays it again.                   * 
As he steps out of the shadow of the house, she sees his face- 
It is Raizo. 
She is startled when someone pounds on the door. It seems like it might rattle off its hinges as she hurries to open it revealing- 
Maslow and he's not happy. 
MASLOW (O.S.) You lied to me. 
He pushes into the room and slams the door behind him. 
MIKA What're you -- 
MASLOW I told you to stop using my confirmation code. 
MIKA I did -- 
MASLOW Dammit, Mika --                                    * (CONTINUED) GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT     6/4/08   39. 44    CONTINUED: (2)                                               44

MASLOW Shit.... 
MIKA What happened? 
MASLOW What happened? Everything's fucking happened. 
He tries to dial it down, succeeds, but only a little. 
MASLOW (CONT'D) When you were slapping my code all over town like some phone number in a bathroom, did you happen to notice the classification code on the cases you were digging through? 
She knows. 
MASLOW (CONT'D) What did it say? 
MIKA (quietly) DNP. 
MASLOW That's right. DNP. DO NOT FUCKING PURSUE! 
MIKA (quietly) Actually that would be DNFP --

She shifts nervously, no poker face.    She turns and leads him into her home office. 
With the key from the tampax box she opens the drawer. 
Maslow watches as she pulls out the contents of Sabatin's box as well as the illegally requisitioned evidence. 
MIKA Most of this is from Sabatin. Copies of what I think are the lost chapters of the Rihle. I think it describes the original location of the Ozunu Clan but my 14th century Arabic is a little rusty. 
MASLOW And this? 
ZABRANSKI Just routine. The agency cares about its field operatives. We monitor for signs of stress, fatigue, mental exhaustion. Agent Maslow has a serious case load. That much work can wear on a man. 
He leaves. 
She gets up and closes her door.    She grabs her phone and calls Maslow. 
MASLOW (V.O.) This is Ryan Maslow. Leave a number- 
She disconnects then texts. 
TEXT: 911. CALL ME. M

It is later. The garage is a gyre of shadows.       Mika walks towards her car. 
The fluorescent light flickers and goes out.      She stands in the dark. 
MIKA Come on...you're kidding me. 
It flickers back on.    She continues to her car.

Maslow. 
MASLOW Ssssshhhhhh.   Sorry, Mika. 
MIKA Fucking Christ, Ryan- 
MASLOW I couldn't talk earlier.   They're watching me. 
MIKA Zabranski came to my office. Asking about you. 
He nods. 
MASLOW I know how Sabatin must have felt. 
MIKA What happened? 
MASLOW I showed Jamison the materials. 
MIKA What did he say? 
50   INT. JAMISON'S OFFICE - DAY                                  50 
A typical autocrat. 
JAMISON This agency is subject to the International laws and agreements that govern the jurisdiction of our authority. If a case is marked DNP we must respect the jurisprudence of the regional government and act accordingly. 
MASLOW I understand that sir but- 
JAMISON Let me be clear, Agent Maslow. In the eyes of the law these materials do not exist. If so, than there is no case and if there is no case there is no reason for this conversation to continue. GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT     6/4/08   45.

MIKA He took the materials? 
MASLOW Come on Mika, how could he take something that didn't exist? He couldn't. Which means that I couldn't copy it either, and if I couldn't copy it than I can't be violating international laws and agreements by still having it. 
She likes this guy. 
MIKA What are we going to do? 
MASLOW Your going to go home. Pack your bags and go on holiday. 
MIKA No way- 
MASLOW Don't fucking argue with me, Mika. I trusted you. Now you've got to trust me. 
MIKA Ryan, I can't let you lose your job because of me- 
MASLOW I'm not talking about my job, Mika. 
He hands her a Glock and two spare clips. 
MASLOW (CONT'D) Take this. It's clean, no serial number. Untraceable. 
MIKA I've never even fired one of these. 
MASLOW (pointing) This is the bad end. This is the end you hold. Point, shoot, run like hell.

MIKA Yeah, well usually if someone introduces themselves it is a convention that the other person does likewise. 
He considers her. 
RAIZO Raizo...is the name I was given. 
MIKA So, you were an orphan? 
His head nods slightly. 
MIKA (CONT'D) Interesting nature verses nurture case study I imagine. 
He cocks an eyebrow. 
MIKA (CONT'D) If it's okay with you, I'll try to fill in some of the blanks. You must have been taken by the Ozunu clan, trained to be an assassin, but something happened and you decided to opt out of the program. I don't imagine this went over so well and since they're after me for just peeking through the keyhole, they must be after you in a major way. But you are also after them or you wouldn't have bothered going to Sabatin. Which I figure means you're searching for the location of The Orphanage because that's obviously the only information Battatu's book would have that you wouldn't already know. 
He looks at her impressed.

SECURITY GOON Prisoner is secure sir. 
For a moment it appears that Raizo looks up as Maslow looks at him, as if somehow Raizo could see through the lens watching him. Then his head drops again. 
MASLOW Right. 
He scans the different monitors. 
MASLOW (CONT'D) Something's wrong with the infrared cam. 
SECURITY GOON No sir, we checked it.

MIKA Ryan, you know this is wrong!   It can't be legal! What is this place? Your own private Guantanamo? 
MASLOW It's an old GDR safehouse. Jamison wants this off the grid. 
MIKA Ryan you're making a huge mistake! 
MASLOW I don't think so. We got reports from Washington, London, Osaka all tagging your boy. Only problem we have is where to extradite him first. 
MIKA So two weeks ago, there's no such thing as a ninja and now every city in the world has a warrant for one? 
MASLOW We must respect the jurisprudence of the regional government and corresponding law enforcement agencies.

MASLOW You're not saying anything worth hearing. Look, if want to do the insubordination tango, let's go, but not in front of the kids okay? Boys, give us a minute. 
The security goons clear out, closing the door behind them.

She wheels on him to let him have it. 
MIKA Damn it, Ryan, I -- 
-- but he holds a finger to his lips, indicating be quiet. 
MASLOW Listen to me, we don't have much time. Look, I don't know what you've stumbled into, but somebody is pulling some major strings inside. 
MIKA They want him dead. He's been fighting them for years. 
MASLOW I believe you. (softer) I believe you. I've been in this business too long not to smell a set-up. But we have to be careful how we handle this. And I can't risk you going AWOL on me again, because -- (beat) -- because I don't want anything to happen to you. 
He glances up at her, and it's clear: he has affection for her. (CONTINUED) GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT     6/4/08   68. 82   CONTINUED:                                                   82 
He presses a tracking device into her hands. 
MASLOW (CONT'D) If trouble comes, turn this on, no matter where, and I'll find you. 
83   INT. SAFE HOUSE VAULT - NIGHT                                83 
Raizo remains motionless, his eyes open when he hears someone coming. 
RAIZO (V.O.) You shouldn't do that they'll catch you. 
KIRIKO (V.O.) Then they'll catch me. 
MASLOW We have to do this again, Coretti? 
MIKA No sir. I just...I have reason to believe that a group of ninja may be on their way here. 
The men chuckle.

MASLOW I think these gentlemen can handle a few whack-jobs wearing pajamas. Am I right? 
They ad-lib responses: Fucking' A sir... Locked, cocked and ready to rock. 
MASLOW (CONT'D) See? 
MIKA But the situation we discussed- 
MASLOW I'm working on that. You have to give me a little time. 
MIKA We don't have time. 
MASLOW They're not here now. 
MIKA They'll be here soon. 
MASLOW How soon- 
88   INT. SAFE-HOUSE - VAULT - NIGHT                               88 
Raizo looks up.       His eyes narrow: they're here. 
89   INT. SAFE-HOUSE GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT                          89 
The lights go out. 
Mika's eyes dart into the pitch, red emergency lights suddenly glowing ominously. 
MIKA Raizo-- 
Maslow spins as she sprints for the stairs. 
MASLOW Mika! 
Maslow draws his firearm and hisses at one of the Special Ops.

MASLOW (CONT'D) Go with her! Secure the prisoner! 
Instantly, tiny LED flashlights and laser targeting systems light up on automatic weapons. Night vision goggles go up. Rather than panicking, the police are instantly in stealth-mode, communicating with quick, urgent hand gestures. 
A handful of men splinter off for the vault while the rest separate into teams with practiced precision, moving through the safe-house, ready for whatever comes. 
89A   INT. SAFE-HOUSE - VAULT - NIGHT                              89A 
Mika charges into the holding area, the detail of men right at her heels. 
EUROPOL WATER GUARD Hold your fire-- 
Raizo's guards release their aim. 
EUROPOL GUARD Christ-- 
EUROPOL WATER GUARD Good way to get yourself killed, Agent Coretti. 
EUROPOL #2 What the fuck's with the lights? 
EUROPOL GUARD We got some guys in pajamas comin' to play spin the bottle. 
One of them lifts a shotgun. 
EUROPOL #2 Huh huh. I got something they can wrap their lips around. 
MIKA I don't have time for this shit. We have to move the prisoner. 
In the back of his cell, Raizo's head lifts at the sound of Mika's voice. 
RAIZO Mika!

EUROPOL WATER GUARD No ma'am. Those aren't our orders. 
Raizo calls from behind the reinforced door. 
RAIZO You've got to get out of here! 
RAIZO Go. Find Maslow. 
He turns to facing the dark. 
RAIZO (CONT'D) Go quick. 
She lurches up the stairs as the Hanta-Kirra descend on him like a murder of crows. 
90B   INT. SAFE-HOUSE - STAIRWELL - NIGHT                          90B 
Mika flies up the stairs taking the steps two at a time rounding the next flight-- 
A beam of light flashing weapons rattling suddenly trained on her. 
MASLOW Mika! 
Her stomach finds its way into her throat. 
(CONTINUED) GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT   6/4/08   71E. 90B   CONTINUED:                                                90B 
MIKA Jesus Ryan-- 
Maslow rushes down to her, another agent scanning the stairs above them. 
MASLOW I thought you were-- 
Mika's eyes widen as the agent on the flight above them is ripped into the air replaced by a squall of red. 
Maslow whirls as a blade suddenly pierces his side-- 
But before it can continue its deadly cut, Maslow catches it in a bloody fist and fires into the shadows. 
One of the Hanta-Kirra falls tumbling past them down the stairs. 
Maslow grunts as he rips the chain blade from his side. 
MIKA Are you ok? 
He nods, a bit woozy. 
MASLOW I hope that wasn't my liver. Gonna need that soon. 
MIKA Come on. 
91    INT. SAFE-HOUSE - GROUND FLOOR                             91 
Sparks dance along the singing ringing blades, the melee escalating in the darkness.

Raizo meets the Hanta-Kirra in the air. Vaults from one wall and door to another, spinning in and out of view as he moves through the shadows. 
The ninjas move with him, matching his speed and ferocity and ability to disappear within the darkness. 
Swords clash against chains and sword and walls.      Sparks fly and blood falls. 
This is the first time we've seen Raizo turned loose. But it's three on one...and Takeshi isn't a pushover. 
Mika and Maslow slam through the exit into-- 
92   INT. GARAGE - NIGHT                                        92 
The building carpark.    Mika suddenly stops. 
MIKA Fuck!

MASLOW What? 
MIKA The manuscript-- 
MASLOW No Mika-- 
He is about to argue but wilts at her resolve. 
MASLOW (CONT'D) Right... 
He stuffs his car keys in her hand, trying not to let his voice crack. 
MASLOW (CONT'D) Two minutes.    Keep it in gear. 
MIKA Maslow-- 
He turns. 
95   INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT                                     95 
The lights are still dead. Maslow is with a team of Europols moving through the stairwell. He talks quietly. 
MIKA Ryan- I had to leave! 
MASLOW Good, stay clear. 
MIKA Do you have the map? 
MASLOW Not yet.   We're heading upstairs now. 
MIKA Where's Raizo

MASLOW He took off.   We think they went after him. 
He looks into the surrounding shadows unsure. 
96   EXT. ROOFTOPS - NIGHT                                         96 
Raizo parkours across the roofs, the Hanta Kirra close behind. 
Shuriken sizzle past; some missing, some lashing open whip cuts across his flesh. 
97   EXT. WINGED VICTORY ROUNDABOUT - NIGHT                        97 
Raizo pulls free the shuriken in his side. Drops them to the ground where they clatter back and forth like so much tossed change. He looks up at winged victory silhouetted against the moonlight. 
And suddenly the ninja are on him. 
Raizo blocks and parries. Counterattacks with a reverse cut - and throws himself sideways as a truck comes roaring down at him. 
The truck fills the screen with lights and horns and three tons of death. 
Raizo cartwheels over the hood, forcing the Scarred Ninja to leap the other way, and as he turns -- 
-- Raizo comes down on him, slashing his shoulder. 
98   EXT. WINGED VICTORY ROUNDABOUT - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS           98 
The fight is now two one against one, and one of them is Takeshi. Their swords crash back and forth, sending sparks flying. 
Raizo is tired, already wounded by the shuriken... 
With a cry, he hurls a second Ninja back and spins to face Takeshi... 
Too late. Takeshi's blade gets under his guard.       Opens up Raizo's side. 
His sword is ripped free from his hand, rebounds off a speeding sedan and clatters to the ground thirty feet away. (CONTINUED) GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT    6/4/08    78. 98   CONTINUED:                                                   98 
Raizo stumbles backward. Life's blood dripping down and splattering on the concrete. 
Takeshi raises his sword high.       Smiles. 
TAKESHI This is the end for you, brother. 
Mika's car slashes across the width of the street screeching to a stop next to Raizo. The door snaps open. 
MIKA Raizo! 
Raizo gets into the car. Collapses into the seat, arms wrapped tight around the ugly wound in his side. She peels away before the others can stop her. 
Mika carves a path through the traffic, driving as fast as she can. Eager to get more miles between them and the ninjas. 
Raizo lets out a gasp as the car goes over a bump.        His shirt is drenched with his own blood. 
MIKA (CONT'D) What were you doing in the street?! 
RAIZO ...waiting for you... 
MIKA You have to go to a hospital. 
RAIZO No. Not a hospital.     Another place. 
The car speeds into the night. 
99   EXT. HERBALIST - NIGHT                                          99 
The sort of store where the owner lives above the shop. Mika pounds on the door as a LIGHT comes on in the floor above. A moment later, the door opens. 
HERBALIST What is it?   What -- 
He steps out of the way as Mika helps Raizo in, bloody and half-dead. GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT    6/4/08   79. 
MASLOW Just tell me where you are. 
She hangs up. 
MASLOW (CONT'D) Mika? Mika? Dammit. 
103   EXT. HIGHWAY MOTEL PARKING LOT - NIGHT                      103 
The car is parked outside the same hotel that he took her too. 
104   INT. HIGHWAY MOTEL ROOM/BATHROOM - NIGHT                    104 
She steps out of the shower and dries herself with an evergreen branch. 
105   INT. HIGHWAY MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT                             105 
In the bedroom, Raizo is sprawled out on the bed. 
She is wearing new clothes. She takes a drag on a cigarette then passes the smoke over her body.

MIKA I know you can't hear me, so I'm sure this doesn't matter, but I'm going to say it anyway. 
She looks at him. 
MIKA (CONT'D) I'm a forensic researcher, okay? That's like a fancy way of saying I'm a librarian. By myself I can't do anything to help you. 
She opens her fist; inside is the tracking device Maslow gave her. 
MIKA (CONT'D) I wanted to think you for saving my life. 
Bending over him, she kisses him gently. 
MIKA (CONT'D) And I hope you can forgive me for this. 
106   INT. MASLOW'S OFFICE - NIGHT                               106 
There's a crowd of other OFFICIALS there, having turned the place into a makeshift command and control center. An AIDE rushes in from an adjoining room, goes to Maslow. 
AIDE Agent Maslow, the tracking device-- 
MASLOW You've got a lock? 
AIDE Triangulating her position now. 
107   EXT. HIGHWAY MOTEL ACROSS PARKING LOT - NIGHT              107 
Mika watches from the trees as a shadow comes to life on the balcony outside their room. It pauses as if sensing something. 
108   INT. HIGHWAY MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT                            108 
Raizo lies alone. The heavy shadows begin to undulate as the Hanta-Kirra emerge.

110   EXT/INT. HIGHWAY MOTEL ROOM - DAWN                           110 
A moment later the door bursts open; Maslow and his men pour into the bedroom. 
The bed is empty. Raizo is gone. 
Mika is sitting in the chair. 
MIKA They took him.     Ten minutes ago. He's gone. 
Maslow embraces her. 
111   FLASHBACK - INT ORPHANAGE DORMITORY - NIGHT                  111 
There is a furious storm raging outside       the thin screened walls. 
Raizo is watching Kiriko who seems to be sleeping. 
In a flash of lightning, her eyes open and she stares at him and he feels in hi heart what she is saying goodbye. 
The flashing ends and as the thunder booms, she is gone, melting quietly into the shadows. 
RAIZO ...no!

118   EXT. ORPHANAGE - COURTYARD - NIGHT                             118 
A portion of the Orphanage's wall burns through.        Mika spots Raizo through the flames. 
She runs for him. 
119   INT. ORPHANAGE OZUNU HOUSE ASSEMBLY ROOM - NIGHT               119 
Raizo begins to weaken. An attack misses wrapping a beam and Ozunu has his opening- 
His assault is ferocious. 
Wounds begin opening like windows shears of blood billowing out. 
Raizo retreats, his chain just blocking, catching, or deflecting the whirlwind attack until-- 
One sound cuts through the furious fight. 
Snap-zoom to Ozunu's ear as-- 
The hammer is cocked, a cylinder spinning into place. 
MIKA Die you fuck! 
She fires and Ozunu twists enough so that the bullet grazes him. 
OZUNU Bitch! 
A scatter shot of shurikens send her diving to the floor. But the distraction gives Raizo his chance. 
The blade whistles, the chain snaps and blood arcs out of Ozunu. 
Rage thunders the hall. 
Mika gets back up and aims but-- 
Ozunu seems to pull the shadows and smoke around him as he disappears. 
MIKA Raizo

She cannot see him. 
Ozunu's attack hits Raizo with the force of a bomb burst, his blade shatters through Raizo's chain-- 
Hurling him back, petals of blood fluttering from his chest. 
Raizo tries to recover, his chain now in two pieces. 
RAIZO Mika! Run! 
MIKA Where is he?   I can't see him! 
RAIZO Get away! 
Ozunu emerges from the smoke behind her, a wraith. His eyes are as black as the sockets of a skull. 
She spins around but is too late. 
The ancient blade runs straight through her chest just as- 
Raizo finds them. 
He sees Kiriko, the same blade taking her life and howls-- 
His pain a force of nature unleashed. 
The chain blades crackle in the air- 
Dual cyclones that batter Ozunu's parrying blade which- 
Finally shatters against Raizo's fury. 
And with a final scream, Raizo lunges at his master, the whistling blades lazering through his body until he separates, pieces hanging in mid-air, like an unstitched rag doll. 
Raizo throws down the blood slick blades and-- 
--hurries to Mika's side. He picks Mika up and walks through the falling timbers and blazing shards to the door.

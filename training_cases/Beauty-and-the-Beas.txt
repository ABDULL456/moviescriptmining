1   EXT. CASTLE GROUNDS - NIGHT                                1 
A MAGNIFICENT CASTLE. Resplendent, bespeaking great wealth and power. The grounds and stonework immaculate. 
NARRATOR (V.O.) Once upon a time in the hidden heart of France, a handsome young Prince lived in a beautiful castle... 
RACK FOCUS to a single RED ROSE clinging to a rose bush on a stormy spring night. A WEATHERED HAND plucks the rose. 
NARRATOR (V.O.) Although he had everything his heart desired, the Prince was selfish and unkind. 
2   INT. BALLROOM ENTRANCE - CASTLE - NIGHT                    2 
TIGHT ON THE PRINCE being groomed by his servants. (We do not see their faces.) A FRENCH MAID paints an exotic animal mask on the Prince's face with a feather brush. A TALL VALET drapes the Prince with an elaborately bejeweled coat. 
NARRATOR (V.O.) He taxed the village to fill his castle with the most beautiful objects... 
The MAID dusts his wig with powder - 
MAID Poof poof... 
- while a MAJORDOMO holds a POCKET WATCH, indicating that they are running late. 
MAJORDOMO Master, it's time. 
With a haughty wave, the Prince instructs his FOOTMAN to bring more light. 
FOOTMAN Oui, maître. 
A CANDELABRA is lifted to the preening Prince as he looks at himself in an ornate HAND MIRROR. 
NARRATOR (V.O.) ... and his parties with the most beautiful people. 
3   INT. BALLROOM - CASTLE - NIGHT                                   3 
The ornate room is filled with BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE from all corners of the world, each on display for the Prince's pleasure. A circle of eligible maidens bow their heads. 
Seated in a throne chair dominated by a majestic COAT OF ARMS, the Prince snaps his fingers impatiently at an ITALIAN MAESTRO, who smiles, revealing comically rotten teeth. 
The maestro sits at a harpsichord and motions to his wife, a LARGE DIVA holding a TINY BICHON FRISÉ. As the music begins, the Prince steps forward. 
The diva fills the room with a voice as big as her frame. The Prince performs a ROUNDELAY with several debutantes: 
DIVA Oh how divine Glamour, music and magic combine See the maidens so anxious to shine Look for a sign that enhances Chances She'll be his special one 
5   INT. BALLROOM - CASTLE - NIGHT                                   5 
The dance speeds up. The Prince connects momentarily with a beautiful woman -- but quickly moves on when his eye catches someone even more dazzling: 
DIVA What a display! What a breathtaking thrilling array (coos to the dog) Every prince, every dog has his day Let us sing with passion, gusto Fit to bust - oh Not a care in the world 
KNOCK KNOCK. The Prince stops. Then a gust of wind blows open the windows. Sconces flicker and go dark. The figure enters in silhouette, hobbling on a CANE. 
Furious, the Prince grabs a lit candelabra from the Footman. He rudely pushes through the crowd, sweeping people from his path. He crosses to the windows, finally revealing -- 
AN OLD BEGGAR WOMAN shivering from the rain. She looks to the Prince with hope and offers him -- A RED ROSE. 
NARRATOR (V.O.) Then, one night, an unexpected intruder arrived at the castle, seeking shelter from the bitter storm. As a gift, she offered the Prince a single rose. 
The PRINCE'S HAND waves her off.    The woman begs on her knees. The Prince motions to the staff. 
NARRATOR (V.O.) Repulsed by her haggard appearance, the Prince turned the woman away. But she warned him not to be deceived by appearances, for beauty is found within. 
The majordomo and footman approach to usher her out.   The woman lowers her head as if to cry -- 
NARRATOR (V.O.) And when he dismissed her again, the old woman's outward appearance melted away to reveal... 
Suddenly, the old woman's cape and hood cocoon.    AN ERUPTION OF LIGHT as she transforms into... 
NARRATOR (V.O.) ...a beautiful Enchantress. 
The wind picks up inside the room.   Frightened, the Prince falls to his knees. 
NARRATOR (V.O.) The Prince tried to apologize but it was too late. For she had seen that there was no love in his heart. 
As the boys scramble into school, Belle steps on the stones over the duck pond -- revealing GIRLS forced into "woman's work" chores, washing clothes in the circular laverie. They're surrounded by women kneading clothes on barrels. 
WASHER WOMEN Never part of any crowd `Cause her head's up on some cloud 
LITTLE GIRLS No denying she's a funny girl That Belle 
A FLIRTATIOUS FARMER approaches a PRETTY FISHMONGER'S WIFE. 
FARMER Bonjour, good day, how is your family? 
PRETTY FISHMONGER'S WIFE (pointed) Bonjour, good day, how is your wife? 
THE FISHMONGER pops up next to his wife, sending the would-be- Lothario into retreat. Another fishmonger, the shrewish CLOTHILDE, accosts him: 
CLOTHILDE I need six eggs 
The FARMER points out the price.   Belle moves past. 
CLOTHILDE (CONT'D) That's too expensive 
BELLE There must be more than this provincial life 
10   INT. CHURCH VESTRY - DAY                                   10 
Belle escapes into the peace and serenity of a country church. Jolly PERE ROBERT looks up as she enters. 
PERE ROBERT Well! If it isn't the only bookworm in town. So where did you run off to this week? 
BELLE Two cities in Northern Italy.    I didn't want to come back. 
Belle hands "Romeo and Juliet" to Pere Robert, who dutifully returns it to the shelves of the town's "library": a COUPLE DOZEN BOOKS in total. She remains hopeful. 
BELLE (CONT'D) Have you got any new places to go? 
PERE ROBERT I'm afraid not. But you may reread any of the old ones that you'd like. 
BELLE Thank you, Pere Robert. Your library almost makes our small corner of the world feel big. 
He smiles.    Belle picks up a new book and smiles back. 
PERE ROBERT Bon voyage. 
11   EXT. VILLAGE OF VILLENEUVE - DAY                             11 
ANGLE ON BELLE -- nose planted in her book, she walks down into the crowded market which is just being set up. Belle passes TOM, DICK, and STANLEY - all burly, tough guys. 
TOM, DICK & STANLEY Look -- there she goes The girl is so peculiar 
Belle buys jam then glides past an APOTHECARY's open cart: 
APOTHECARY I wonder if she's feeling well 
Belle ducks under CHEESE SELLERS carrying their trays: 
CHEESE SELLERS With a dreamy far-off look And her nose stuck in a book What a puzzle to the rest of us Is Belle 
Behind her, FLORISTS pass with huge bouquets. It's a glorious parade but Belle remains oblivious as she continues to read... 
BELLE Oh... isn't this amazing? It's my favorite part because you'll see Here's where she meets Prince Charming But she won't discover that it's him `Til chapter three 
Three fashion-crazed VILLAGE LASSES -- all dressed in the same style -- pop their heads from the windows of the dress shop. Their MOTHER, who is besotted with Belle, heads outside when she sees her: 
VILLAGE LASSES' MOTHER Now it's no wonder that her name means "Beauty" Her looks have got no parallel 
Her daughters follow, seething with jealousy: 
VILLAGE LASS #1 But behind that fair facade I'm afraid she's rather odd 
VILLAGE LASSES' MOTHER (greets Belle) Very different from the rest of us 
VILLAGE LASSES She's nothing like the rest of us Yes, different from the rest of us 
Belle slips through the crowd. 
VILLAGERS Is Belle 
11A   EXT. VILLAGE PROMONTORY - DAY                            11A 
Looking down on the village is GASTON, a dashingly handsome war hero clad in a dazzling gold breastplate. The only thing bigger than his muscles is his ego. Strapped on his saddle is a musket and the spoils of his hunt: rabbit, fox, and fowl. Riding beside him is Gaston's long-suffering aide-de- camp and devoted best friend LEFOU. 
Through his spyglass, Gaston spots Belle. 
GASTON Look at her, LeFou. My future wife. Belle is the most beautiful girl in the village. That makes her the best. 
12   EXT. BELLE'S COTTAGE - DAY                                   12 
Belle hears the tinkle of a sweet MUSIC BOX tune wafting out of her father's basement workshop. 
13   INT. CELLAR WORK ROOM - BELLE'S COTTAGE - DAY                13 
Belle descends into to her father's dusty work room. Sunlight spotlights MAURICE hunched over his workspace. Belle quietly watches as he sings along with the music box theme. 
MAURICE How does a moment last forever? How can a story never die? It is love we must hold on to Never easy -- but we try 
Maurice tinkers with gears on the box, which depicts an artist in a Parisian garret, painting his wife's portrait as she holds a red rose above their baby. 
MAURICE (CONT'D) Sometimes our happiness is captured Somehow a time and place stand still Love lives on inside our hearts And always will (seeing Belle) Oh, good, Belle, you're back. Can you please hand me the -- 
Before he can say the word "screwdriver" it's in his hand. 
MAURICE (CONT'D) And the -- 
Tweezers.   Then Belle hands him a small hammer... 
MAURICE (CONT'D) No no I don't need -- 
... just as a spring pops off. 
MAURICE (CONT'D) Actually yes, that's exactly what I need. 
He goes back to tinkering. Belle gazes at other music boxes, each a small work of art, depicting famous landmarks from around the world. 
BELLE Papa, do you think I'm odd? 
MAURICE My daughter? Odd?     Where did you get an idea like that? 
BELLE I don't know. People talk. 
MAURICE Oh. People. This village may be small, small-minded even, but small also means safe. 
Maurice can see this line of argument doesn't do much for his daughter. 
MAURICE (CONT'D) Even back in Paris, I knew a girl who was so different, so daring, so ahead of her time that people mocked her until the day they found themselves imitating her. 
BELLE Just tell me one more thing about her. 
Maurice turns to the music box as if to change the subject. But looking back up to Belle's eagerness, he relents. 
MAURICE Your mother was... fearless. Fearless. 
With that, Maurice closes his music box. 
14    EXT. BELLE'S COTTAGE - DAY                                   14 
As Maurice carefully loads his music boxes onto his wagon, Belle tends to the family's old glue horse, PHILIPPE. 
Maurice climbs into the wagon, and smiles down at his daughter. 
MAURICE What would you like me to bring you from the market? 
BELLE A rose like the one in the painting. 
MAURICE You ask for that every year. 
BELLE And every year, you bring it. 
MAURICE Then I shall bring you another. You have my word. Come on, Philippe! 
BELLE I'll see you tomorrow! 
MAURICE Tomorrow!    With the rose! 
As Maurice rides away, Belle's warmth gives way to concern. 
BELLE (to herself) Stay safe... 
14A   INT. BELLE'S COTTAGE - TACKROOM - DAY                    14A 
Surrounded by design sketches, Belle's workbench features a small model of her `washing machine' prototype. Belle places the miniature barrel in position... fastens a rope to a leather strap... shaves chips off a block of soap... collects the soap chips in a small sack... and rushes out. 
15    EXT. VILLAGE OF VILLENEUVE - LAVERIE - DAY                   15 
A young WASHER GIRL watches as -- 
Belle tosses clothes and some soap chips into an empty BARREL and rolls it into the fountain! It bobs on its side. Tying the other end of the strap to the mule's harness, she sets him walking around the circular laverie... 
WASHER GIRL What are you doing? 
BELLE I might be a farm girl, but I'm not simple. I'm sorry, but I will never marry you, Gaston. 
Gaston keeps the gallant smile plastered as she shuts the door in his face. 
20   EXT. BELLE'S COTTAGE - SUNSET                                 20 
Belle watches Gaston leave.   She opens the door. 
BELLE Can you imagine? Me, the wife of that boorish, brainless... 
She turns away from the home she thinks she will never escape. 
BELLE (CONT'D) Madame Gaston, can't you just see it Madame Gaston, his little wife No sir, not me, I guarantee it (MORE) 
BELLE (CONT'D) I want much more than this Provincial life... 
21   EXT. VILLAGE PROMONTORY - SUNSET                                21 
Belle races up the hills to the outskirts of town. When she reaches the highest point, we circle around to reveal the town spread out beneath her. 
BELLE I want adventure in the great wide somewhere I want it more than I can tell And for once it might be grand To have someone understand I want so much more than They've got planned 
As the last rays of light fade we RISE to reveal a forest in the 
distance, where the skies begin to rage. A swirling wind and a streak of... 
22   EXT. WOODS - EVENING                                            22 
Lightning. The sky flashes.     The wind picks up.   Worried, Maurice urges Philippe on. 
MAURICE The woods are lovely, aren't they Philippe...? I only wish I recognized them. Do you know where we are? Because I don't. 
As the woods get darker, a WITHERED TREE that looks like an ELDERLY PERSON'S CANE is struck by lightning. 
MAURICE (CONT'D) Whoa! 
The tree splits in two, one half falling into the road, revealing... a HIDDEN PATH. Philippe whinnies nervously. 
MAURICE (CONT'D) Hmm... yes, we can go this way. Walk on! One path closes, another one opens. 
They leave the blocked road and head down the path.    Maurice looks down to see a light snow cover on the ground.    Philippe snorts. 
MAURICE (CONT'D) It's all right boy, it's just a bit of snow... in June. 
And they descend into -- 
23   EXT. ENCHANTED WOODS - EVENING                               23 
We have entered another world. A light, whirling snow descends on Maurice, dusting his coat. The clippity-clop of hooves echo in stillness. 
Suddenly, A WHITE WOLF roars out of the bushes, barely missing them. Gaze darting, Maurice notices WHITE WOLVES running on an icy ledge above him. The wolves keep pace, massing to overrun him. 
MAURICE Go, Philippe! Hurry! 
Maurice urges his horse on, but his rickety cart starts to buckle. A HARNESS IS LOOSE. 
The wolves leap in front of the cart, which comes undone, tipping over on its side. The chest of music boxes smashes open on the ground. Maurice is launched up onto a ridge -- and finds himself face-to-face with the snarling and scarred ALPHA WOLF. 
Terrified, Maurice turns and begins sliding down the snowy ridge 
-- towards a trio of wolves waiting below. 
MAURICE (CONT'D) Philippe! 
As Maurice drops from the ridge, Philippe appears beneath him -- 
and Maurice lands on his back! 
MAURICE (CONT'D) Go!   Go! 
Philippe rides. PAWS crush twigs -- SLAVERING JAWS -- EYES mad with hunger -- a gleam of FANGS -- Philippe gallops. Maurice races toward the CASTLE ICE GATES -- which churn open as the wolves draw near. 
Maurice and Philippe speed through the gates as the wolves skid to a stop, their HOWLS turning to YELPS OF FEAR. 
24   EXT. CASTLE GROUNDS - EVENING                                24 
Maurice stares in open-mouth awe at THE BEAST'S CASTLE. A grey edifice seemingly growing out of stone and reaching to troubled skies. It feels like a place hiding its face from the world. 
MAURICE (to Philippe) Oh Philippe, you saved my life... They'll have to get their dinner somewhere else. 
ANGLE ON MAURICE -- as he draws near the castle, he notices a colonnade filled with WHITE ROSE BUSHES. Just beyond, he sees the door to the STABLES swinging in the wind. A LAMP has been lit inside. As if inviting a tired traveler. 
Maurice strokes Philippe's neck. 
BELLE Forget you? Everything I am is because of you. 
MAURICE I love you, Belle.    Don't be afraid. 
BELLE I love you too, Papa... 
She pulls him close. 
BELLE (CONT'D) I'm not afraid. (whispers) And I will escape, I promise. 
MAURICE What?! 
With that, she pivots and swings her father through the door just as the beast slams it shut. Maurice trips to the ground, giving the beast a second to turn to Belle. They lock eyes. 
THE BEAST You took his place. 
BELLE He is my father. 
THE BEAST He's a fool. So are you. 
The beast turns and drags Maurice away. 
BELLE Don't hurt him! 
Through the latticework, Belle sees the beast and her father disappear down the corridor. She rushes to the window and watches the beast carry her father down the spiral staircase of the prison tower. 
MAURICE Belle!   I'll come back!    I promise! 
Once she is alone, Belle cannot help herself.      She slumps to the floor and the tears come. We FADE OUT.

39   INT. CELL - PRISON TOWER - DUSK                                39 
Belle huddles in the corner.     The cell door swings opens. 
LUMIÈRE (O.S.) Forgive my intrusion, mademoiselle, but I have been sent to escort you to your room. 
Belle wipes her tears and stands.    She grabs a small stool, ready to strike. 
BELLE My room?   But I thought -- 
LUMIÈRE (O.S.) What? That once this door closes it will not open again, RARRR? I know, he gets so dramatic. 
Belle bounds out of the cell, raising the stool to hit a grown man. Instead, she sees... a candelabra wave at her. 
LUMIÈRE (CONT'D) `Allo. 
BELLE AHHH! 
Like seeing a mouse, Belle bashes the candelabra. It grunts as it clatters on the stone floor. The candles extinguished. 
WHOOSH -- the first candle relights. WHOOSH -- the second. Illuminated by the two arm candles, Belle makes out EYES and a rudimentary "FACE" in the design. 
LUMIÈRE (recovering) Oh, you are very strong.    That's a great quality! 
BELLE What are you? 
The arms light the main candle to reveal a rakish smile. 
LUMIÈRE I am Lumière. 
BELLE And you can talk. 
Cogsworth appears, out of breath. 
COGSWORTH Of course he can talk, it's all he ever does! Now Lumiere, as head of the household, I demand that you put her back in the cell at once! 
Officially freaked out now, Belle retreats to her cell, in search of a better weapon. 
LUMIÈRE What do you want to be for the rest of your life, Cogsworth: a man or a mantle clock? 
They turn back to Belle, re-emerging from the cell. 
LUMIÈRE (CONT'D) Ready, miss? (to Cogsworth) Trust me. 
40   EXT. ROOFTOP WALKWAY - CASTLE - EVENING                    40 
Holding Lumière, Belle follows Cogsworth across a stone walkway high above the grounds. Her eyes dart, looking for an escape route. Instead, she sees how vast the castle and woods are. 
GARDEROBE Finally. A woman. Pretty eyes. Proud face. Perfect canvas. Yes! I will find you something worthy of a princess. 
BELLE But I'm not a princess. 
GARDEROBE Nonsense! Now, let's see what I've got in my drawers. 
Garderobe's doors open and a few moths fly out. 
GARDEROBE (CONT'D) Oh, how embarrassing. 
Garderobe places a large HOOP over Belle's head, and proceeds to create an outfit using fabric and her pinking-shear hands. FROUFROU, a piano stool, runs in, barking like a dog. 
GARDEROBE (CONT'D) Come here, Froufrou. Come help mama! 
Froufrou tugs at the fabric, helping Garderobe complete the outfit -- which is garish and too too much, all wrong for Belle. 
GARDEROBE (CONT'D) Perfetta! 
Lumière and Cogsworth put on a game smile. 
LUMIÈRE Mm.   Subtle. Understated.    I love it! 
With a deep bow and a whistle for Froufrou, Lumière drags Cogsworth out. Plumette and Froufrou follow. Garderobe calls out after her beloved dog. 
GARDEROBE Froufrou, send my love to the maestro! 
The door closes. Belle is alone. Garderobe instantly falls asleep with a big SNORE. Belle has one beat of... where the hell am I? She ducks down, then crawls out from underneath the enormous dress, which remains standing. 
Belle looks around the room with one thing in mind: escape. She quickly moves to the window. Opens it. She looks down at the 100 foot drop leading to the grounds. 
Belle turns back to the room, and gazes at the dress.   An idea taking shape. 
43   EXT. COUNTRY INN - NIGHT                                     43 
A LAMPLIGHTER is hard at work outside as we hear fiddle music coming from the inn. 
44   INT. COUNTRY INN - NIGHT                                     44 
Amidst the animal heads, antlers, and drunken villagers, there is an even sadder sight -- GASTON. He drowns his sorrows in ale while LEFOU listens. 
GASTON Picture it, LeFou -- a rustic cabin. My latest kill roasting on the fire. Adorable children running around us while my love rubs my tired feet. But what does Belle say? "I will never marry you, Gaston." 
LEFOU You know, there are other girls. 
The village lasses perk up.   "Yes!   There are other girls!" 
GASTON A great hunter doesn't waste his time on rabbits. 
The lasses deflate. "Awww!" LeFou decides it's time to cheer up his best friend/boss. Thus begins "GASTON." 
LEFOU Gosh it disturbs me to see you Gaston looking so down in the dumps Every guy here'd love to be you Gaston Even when taking your lumps There's no man in town as admired as you You're everyone's fa-vor-ite guy Everyone's awed and inspired by you And it's not very hard to see why 
LeFou gives a nod (and a large tip) to the FIDDLE PLAYER in the corner, who nods back, and begins to play... 
LEFOU (CONT'D) No one's slick as Gaston No one's quick as Gaston No one's neck's as incredibly thick as Gaston For there's no man in town half as manly Perfect, a pure paragon! You can ask any Tom, Dick or Stanley And they'll tell you whose team they prefer to be on! 
LeFou hops onto the bar, squeezing himself between TOM, DICK, and STANLEY. 
TOM/DICK/STANLEY Who plays darts like Gaston? Who breaks hearts like Gaston? 
LEFOU Who's much more than the sum of his parts like Gaston? 
GASTON (confidence growing) As a specimen, yes, I'm intimidating 
LeFou hails a BARMAID and buys everyone a round of drinks. The villagers raise their mugs and cheer. 
LEFOU/VILLAGERS My what a guy, that Gaston! 
Gaston stands, and clasps LeFou in gratitude... 
GASTON I needed encouragement; thank you, LeFou 
LEFOU Well, there's no one as easy to bolster as you! 
... only to find himself in an uncomfortably tight hug. 
LEFOU (CONT'D) Too much? 
GASTON Yep. 
VILLAGERS No one fights like Gaston Douses lights like Gaston! 
LEFOU In a wrestling match nobody bites like Gaston! 
Maurice approaches.   So grateful. 
MAURICE Thank you, Captain.   Thank you. 
GASTON Don't thank me, Maurice.    Lead us to the beast. 
Maurice exits.   Gaston follows, gesturing to LeFou. 
LEFOU (finally getting it) Ohhh. 
46   INT. KITCHEN - CASTLE - NIGHT                                46 
The staff is excited as they scramble to get ready for dinner. CHIP, the 8 year-old tea cup, rides his saucer around like a skateboard. He circles his teapot mother MRS. POTTS, a no- nonsense yet loving governess. 
CHIP Mama, there's a girl in the castle! 
MRS. POTTS Yes, Chip.     We know. Slow down. 
CHIP Is she pretty? Is she nice?     What kind of tea does she like? 
MRS. POTTS We'll find out soon enough. Slow down before you break your handle! 
But Chip doesn't slow down. Before Mrs. Potts can chase, CUISINIÈR, the frustrated French chef-turned-oven, pours hot water into her to prepare tea. 
CUISINIÈR Heads up, Mrs. Potts! 
She flushes and reacts with pleasure as if stepping into a warm bath. 
INT. DINING ROOM - CASTLE - SAME 
The beast enters the dining room and sits at one end of a long dining table. He looks at his place setting, surprised to find flatware and crystal. Confused, he looks up. 
THE BEAST'S POV rises to find another place setting at the other end of the long table. When he notices the romantic candles, he swats his own place setting off the table in anger. 
47   INT. KITCHEN - CASTLE - SAME                                 47 
A voice bellowing from the dining room causes Lumiere and Cogsworth to turn. 
THE BEAST (O.S.) LUMIÈRE! 
Cogsworth balks with terror. 
LUMIÈRE Be calm, let me do the talking. 
A fuming beast storms in, and looks down at the assembled staff. Lumière is as good a liar as Cogsworth is not. 
THE BEAST YOU'RE MAKING HER DINNER!? 
LUMIÈRE We thought you might appreciate the company. 
COGSWORTH Master, I can assure you that I had no part in this hopeless plan. Preparing a dinner, designing a gown for her, giving her a suite in the east wing -- 
THE BEAST YOU GAVE HER A BEDROOM!? 
Cornered by the beast, Cogsworth has no choice but to... 
COGSWORTH No no, he gave her a bedroom. 
LUMIÈRE That is true. But if the girl is the one who can break the spell, maybe you can start by using dinner to charm her. (turns to Cogsworth) Good thinking, Cogsworth! 
COGSWORTH What?! 
THE BEAST That's the most ridiculous idea I've ever heard! "Charm the prisoner." 
LUMIÈRE You must try, master. With every passing day, we become less human. 
THE BEAST She's the daughter of a common thief. What kind of person do you think that makes her? 
MRS. POTTS Oh, you can't judge people by who their father is, now can you? 
It's a loaded statement. The staff cringes, ready for his retaliation. Instead, a grunt, and then -- 
48   INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE BELLE'S BEDROOM - CASTLE - NIGHT      48 
KNOCK. KNOCK. The beast stands at Belle's door while his servants stand by his side to play Cyrano. 
THE BEAST You will join me for dinner!     That's not a request. 
MRS. POTTS Gently, master. The girl lost her father and her freedom in one day. 
LUMIÈRE Yes. The poor thing is probably in there, scared to death. 
MRS. POTTS Exactly. 
LUMIÈRE (CONT'D) They can sing, they can dance After all, miss, this is France! 
A small guillotine on the table drops, slicing the baguette. MENUS fly in overhead, buzzing a disgruntled Cogsworth. Belle reaches up and grabs one. 
LUMIÈRE (CONT'D) And a dinner here is never second best Go on unfold your menu (MORE) 
LUMIèRE (CONT'D) Take a glance and then you'll Be our guest, be our guest 
LUMIÈRE AND COGSWORTH Be our guest! 
Cogsworth shushes Lumière, and Lumière jabs him back.   One by one the kitchen doors swing open, presenting: 
LUMIÈRE Beef ragout, cheese souffle, Pie and pudding en flambé! 
The fish pie explodes! A piece of cod hits Cogsworth in the face, knocking him over. 
LUMIÈRE (CONT'D) We'll prepare and serve with flair A culinary cabaret! 
Flute glasses fill up with champagne and then break into a Bob Fosse homage. Belle grabs a glass, but Lumière snatches it before she sips. 
LUMIÈRE (CONT'D) You're alone and you're scared But the banquet's all prepared! 
Lumière coaxes the flatware to its feet. 
LUMIÈRE (CONT'D) No one's gloomy or complaining While the flatware's entertaining! 
The flatware hold out a napkin, into which Lumière jumps, like a 
trampoline. He is launched into the air, swinging between chandeliers a la Cirque du Soleil. 
LUMIÈRE (CONT'D) We tell jokes, I do tricks With my fellow candlesticks 
CHANDELIER CANDLESTICKS And it's all in perfect taste That you can bet! 
Lumière falls and lands back in the middle of the champagne flutes. They rise up around him. 
LUMIÈRE Come on and lift your glass You've won your own free pass To be our guest (to Cogsworth) If you're stressed, it's fine dining we suggest. 
LUMIÈRE (CONT'D) Oui our guest Be our guest, be our guest! 
Cogsworth steps back as Lumière again takes center stage in a Martha Graham inspired solo. 
LUMIÈRE (CONT'D) Life is so unnerving For a servant who's not serving 
Belle reaches again for food but is stopped by Lumière's melodramatic histrionics. He wraps himself in a napkin for the full Martha Graham effect. 
LUMIÈRE (CONT'D) He's not whole Without a soul to wait upon 
Lumière does a `tragic walk' down the table. Reaching the end, he slides down to the floor on the tablecloth, then gathers it around his neck and continues on. 
Belle tries to stab a bite as the food moves past her, as if on a conveyer belt. Sliding past her, Cogsworth wobbles. 
On the floor, snow swirls around Lumière. We pull out to see several "ETTES" flinging salt at him to create the effect. 
LUMIÈRE (CONT'D) Ah, those good old days when we were useful Suddenly, those good old days are gone 
Reaching the end of the table, plates dive and spin into neat piles -- 
LUMIÈRE (CONT'D) Too long we've been rusting Needing so much more than dusting Needing exercise A chance to use our skills 
-- while Cogsworth lands on Lumière's lap below. Chapeau scoops 
them both up and drops them back on the table before Belle. 
LUMIÈRE (CONT'D) Most days we just lay around the castle Flabby, fat and lazy 
Lumière playfully pokes Cogsworth in his pot belly -- then takes a flying leap! 
LUMIÈRE (CONT'D) You walked in, and oops-a-daisie! 
58   INT. KITCHEN - CASTLE - NIGHT                               58 
Mrs. Potts hops along the edge of the sink basin. 
MRS. POTTS It's a guest, it's a guest! Sakes alive, and I'll be blessed! Wine's been poured and thank the Lord I've had more napkins freshly pressed! 
She ascents to the top of a tiered, circular pastry table, as napkins twirl around her. Desserts appear and circle Mrs. Potts. Then tea cups enter on the outer circle, moving in the opposite direction. 
MRS. POTTS (CONT'D) With dessert, she'll want tea And my dear, that's fine with me! While the cups do their soft shoeing, I'll be bubbling, I'll be brewing! 
From overhead, a la Busby Berkeley, we reveal desserts, teacups, napkins, the floor, everything circling in opposing directions. Mrs. Potts descends, jumping onto her tea trolley -- and notices a smudge of icing on Chip. 
MRS. POTTS (CONT'D) I'll get warm, piping hot Heaven's sake, is that a spot? 
BELLE Nothing. 
THE BEAST DO YOU REALIZE WHAT YOU COULD HAVE DONE!? YOU COULD HAVE DAMNED US ALL! GET OUT! GO! 
Belle runs.   The beast turns and covers the rose, panicked and protective. 
65,66   INT. FOYER - CASTLE - NIGHT                               65,66 
Lumière and Cogsworth play chess on an upper landing, with Froufrou resting between them. 
LUMIÈRE Checkmate.     Again. 
COGSWORTH Because you cheated.     Again. 
Belle appears, racing down the west wing staircase. 
LUMIÈRE Mademoiselle... what are you doing? 
BELLE Getting out of here! 
Cogsworth jumps onto the chess board as Lumiere hops to the floor. 
COGSWORTH Stop! 
LUMIÈRE Go go, Froufrou! 
Froufrou jumps up and starts after Belle. 
COGSWORTH Yes Froufrou, stop her! 
Belle barrels down the main staircase, Froufrou in close pursuit. 
Mrs. Potts enters from the kitchen, wearing a tea cosy. 
MRS. POTTS You don't want to go out there! 
At the top of the stairs, Cogsworth sounds a whistle.     In quick cuts, WINDOWS drop and SHUTTERS close. 
Belle hits the bottom of the grand staircase and runs towards the door -- only to watch it bolt itself locked. 
MRS. POTTS (CONT'D) Stop her! 
Froufrou runs in front of Belle to block her exit, and growls. 
COGSWORTH Who's a good dog? 
Then suddenly, his growls turn to playful yaps, as he stands on his hind legs and pants playfully. 
COGSWORTH (CONT'D) What? No, it's not playtime!      Bad dog! Bad dog! 
MRS. POTTS What part of `stop her' don't you understand, dog?! 
Froufrou spins and scrambles outside, scooting through the low postern door within the great front door. In his excitement, he's provided Belle with an escape! 
Belle snatches her cloak from a bewildered Chapeau, and shimmies out through this same `doggie door.' 
LUMIÈRE Please, don't go! It's dangerous! 
Mrs. Potts rushes forward but it's too late.      A look of dread settles on her face... 
MRS. POTTS Oh my... 
67   OMITTED                                                       67

69   EXT. ENCHANTED WOODS - NIGHT                                  69 
HOWL. Philippe's hooves hit the snowy landscape.   Belle races through the woods. She looks back to see if the beast followed her. She only sees a glimpse of the castle. She thinks she has escaped. Surely, she has escaped. 
WOLVES HOWL NEARBY. 
ANGLE ON PHILIPPE'S MUDDY HOOFPRINT -- a WOLF'S PAW smashes down over the print -- the wolf howls -- 
ANGLE ON BELLE -- out of the corner of her eye, she sees SHAPES OF A DOZEN WHITE WOLVES flitting through the trees, closing in on her. 
Belle forges on -- the wolves are not bothering to hide anymore, they've emerged from the trees to take down their prey -- closing in fast -- 
-- Belle pushes through the undergrowth to find she has reached a FROZEN POND. Philippe doesn't hesitate. He gallops onto the ice, and across the pond. The sound of ice CRACKING under his hooves is deep and low. And increasing. 
Philippe's hooves slide on the ice.   The wolves close in. 
Philippe makes it across the pond onto land.   But before Belle can feel any relief -- 
70A   EXT. REMOTE FOREST ROAD - NIGHT (LATER)                      70A 
Maurice is now tied to a tree. Gaston secures the knot and walks to the carriage. Darkness has come over Gaston. 
GASTON If Maurice won't give me his blessing, then he is in my way. Once the wolves are finished with him, Belle will have no one to take care of her but me. 
LEFOU For the sake of exhausting all of our options, do we maybe want to consider a less gruesome alternative? 
Gaston climbs into the carriage. 
GASTON Are you coming? 
LeFou looks back to Maurice, an apology in his eyes.   He climbs into the carriage. 
Gaston and LeFou ride off, leaving Maurice to die. 
71    INT. BEAST'S LAIR - WEST WING - CASTLE - NIGHT                71 
The beast lies in his old human bed. Belle dabs a large gash on the beast's arm. The beast bares his fangs and lets out a roar. 
THE BEAST ROOOOAARRRR! Ow! That hurts! 
BELLE If you held still, it wouldn't hurt as much. 
THE BEAST If you hadn't run away, none of this would have happened. 
BELLE Well if you hadn't frightened me, I wouldn't have run away. 
The household staff anxiously watches the battle of words. 
THE BEAST Well you shouldn't have been in the west wing. 
BELLE Well you should learn to control your temper. 
The beast is momentarily silenced. Belle looks down at the wound she has been dabbing. It's worse than she thought. 
BELLE (CONT'D) Try to get some rest. 
The beast's breath slows to a low rumble as his eyes slip shut. 
MRS. POTTS Thank you, Miss. 
LUMIÈRE We are eternally grateful. 
BELLE Why do you care so much about him? 
MRS. POTTS We've looked after him all his life. 
BELLE But he has cursed you somehow. (off their silence) Why? You did nothing. 
MRS. POTTS You're quite right there, dear. You see, when the master lost his mother, and his cruel father took that sweet innocent lad and twisted him up to be just like him... we did nothing. 
Belle notes their shame just as we HEAR the first notes of a beautiful melody coming from the ballroom downstairs. This is the beast's lullaby -- "DAYS IN THE SUN." 
LUMIÈRE Let him sleep. 
As the staff and Belle exit, the beast stirs. We move from his face, shivering in a fever dream, to discover -- 
71A   INT. BEAST'S LAIR - WEST WING - CASTLE - NIGHT              71A 
The YOUNG PRINCE gazes down sadly. 
YOUNG PRINCE Days in the sun When my life has barely begun 
We move around to reveal that he is looking at the pale body of THE QUEEN on her deathbed. 
YOUNG PRINCE (CONT'D) Not until my own life is done Will I ever leave you 
Behind the prince, a figure approaches: his FATHER. Cruelty written on his face. Placing his large hand on the boy's shoulder, he pulls him out of the room. 
72     INT. CASTLE - BALLROOM/FOYER - NIGHT                      72 
In the gloomy ballroom, Cadenza plays the beautiful melody. 
CADENZA Will I tremble again To my dear one's gorgeous refrain? 
The melody drifts through the ballroom until we find Lumière and 
Plumette, dancing: 
LUMIÈRE & PLUMETTE Will you now forever remain Out of reach of my arms? 
72AA   INT. CASTLE - KITCHEN - NIGHT                           72AA 
BELLE (O.S.) Love can transpose to form and dignity. Love looks not with the eyes but with the mind. And therefore -- 
He opens his eyes to see that Belle isn't reading, she's reciting from memory. He joins in -- 
THE BEAST And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind. 
Belle looks up, surprised. 
BELLE So you know Shakespeare? 
THE BEAST I had an expensive education. 
BELLE Actually, "Romeo and Juliet" is my favorite play. 
THE BEAST Why is that not a surprise? 
BELLE Sorry? 
THE BEAST All that heartache and pining and -- (a beastly shudder) There are so many better things to read. 
BELLE Like what? 
The beast smiles. 
77   INT. LIBRARY - CASTLE - DAY                              77 
The beast has lead Belle into the biggest grandest private library in all of France. The chamber is vast and lined floor to ceiling with books. 
THE BEAST Should be something here you can start with... 
He turns to see Belle, speechless. 
BELLE It's wonderful. 
THE BEAST Oh. Yes, I suppose it is... Well, if you like it so much, then it's yours. 
The beast starts to leave.     He is stopped by -- 
BELLE Have you really read every one of these books? 
THE BEAST Not all of them. Some are in Greek. 
BELLE Was that a joke?   Are you making jokes now? 
THE BEAST Maybe. 
Belle shakes her head but is also charmed.    The beast turns and strides out. 
78    INT. DINING ROOM - CASTLE - NIGHT                            78 
The beast eats at the table, reading a book which sits on a stand. He looks up to see Belle sit at the other end with three 
books. She picks up her spoon and starts to eat. The beast plants his face in the bowl. Looks up a second later having inhaled the soup, half of which is dripping from his fur. Belle 
attempts a smile. "SOMETHING THERE" begins. 
78A   EXT. CASTLE GROUNDS - WOODED GLEN - DAY                     78A 
Belle and the beast cross a stone footbridge. She reads aloud to the patient, who moves tentatively, favoring a wounded leg. 
BELLE The air is blue and keen and cold And in a frozen sheath enrolled 
The beast stops.   Belle, savoring the words, keeps walking. 
BELLE (CONT'D) Each branch, each twig, each blade of grass Seems clad miraculously with glass 
Belle notices that she's walking alone.   She turns back, sees the beast staring out soulfully: 
BEAST I feel as if I'm seeing it for the first time. 
As she follows his gaze, we reveal a splendidly desolate landscape. The very thing Belle has just described, now spread out before her. 
BEAST (CONT'D) Is there more? 
Belle smiles, pleased that for a moment at least he's become a fan of poetry. She reads: 
BELLE But in that solemn silence Is heard the whisper Of every sleeping thing: "Look, look at me Come wake me up For still here I be." 
Belle meets the beast's eyes.   Both suddenly aware of hidden meanings in the poet's words. 
79   EXT. CASTLE GROUNDS - DAY                                  79 
In the fresh snow, Belle brushes Philippe's coat. The beast looks at Belle -- she nods -- and he pets the horse. Philippe reacts skittishly, causing the beast to withdraw. Belle takes his hand and places it on Philippe. Then, as she turns away -- 
The beast nods, a bit shyly. 
THE BEAST All right.     I felt like a change. 
BELLE I never thanked you for saving my life. 
THE BEAST Well I never thanked you... for not leaving me to be eaten by wolves. 
Belle laughs. A quiet charged moment, which ends with the SHOUTS and LAUGHTER of the servants in the castle. Belle and the beast can't help but smile. 
BELLE They know how to have a good time. 
THE BEAST Yes. But when I enter the room, laughter dies. 
BELLE Me, too. The villagers say that I'm a "funny girl," but I don't think they mean it as a compliment. 
THE BEAST I'm sorry.     Your village sounds terrible. 
BELLE Almost as lonely as your castle. 
He turns to her with a melancholy smile.       Then, an idea. 
THE BEAST What do you say we run away? 
Belle is surprised by the suggestion. 
85   INT. LIBRARY - CASTLE - NIGHT                                     85 
The beast unlocks a desk cabinet. In it, resting on velvet, its gold-leaf cover faintly glimmering with magic, is a LEATHER BOUND BOOK covered in a thick layer of dust. 
THE BEAST Another little "gift" from the Enchantress... 
The beast cracks open the book to reveal AN ANTIQUE WORLD ATLAS. No countries. Just land and sea. 
THE BEAST (CONT'D) A book that truly allows you to escape. 
Belle moves closer to find the pen and ink drawing is alive. Waves lap the beaches. Green trees sway in invisible wind. 
BELLE How amazing. 
THE BEAST It was her cruelest trick of all. The outside world has no place for a creature like me. But it can for you. 
The beast offers his hand and Belle takes it.    He gently moves her hand to the book. 
THE BEAST (CONT'D) Think of the place you've most wanted to see. First, see it in your mind's eye. Now feel it in your heart. 
Belle nods -- this isn't a difficult decision. The moment her hand hits the page, we ENTER it, SPINNING through celestial flares -- which blur and recombine -- as the lights of Paris. We descend over the city and into... 
86   INT. ARTIST'S GARRET - MONTMARTRE - NIGHT                      86 
... the top floor of a windmill in Montmartre. 
THE BEAST Where did you take us? 
BELLE Paris. 
The beast looks out of a window and sees glittering lights. 
THE BEAST Oh, I love Paris. What would you like to see first? Notre Dame? The Champs- Elysées? No? Too touristy? 
He turns to find Belle silent.   Her eyes brimming with tears. 
BELLE It's so much smaller than I imagined. 
The beast watches Belle walk through her childhood home... the artist's garret that Maurice recreated in his signature music box. Abandoned years ago, the room is crumbling. Belle finds the remains of her father's easel. A tarnished wall mirror. Her own broken crib. 
BELLE (CONT'D) This is the Paris of my childhood These were the borders of my life In this crumbling dusty attic Where an artist loved his wife I thought that I would find an answer Here where his heart has always lived (MORE) 
BELLE (CONT'D) Now I see it's empty and abandoned Easy to remember Harder to move on Knowing that the Paris of my childhood Is gone 
Belle notices something tucked into a corner of the crib. She pries it loose. It is a BABY'S RATTLE carved into the shape of a rose. The beast focuses on it. 
THE BEAST What happened to your mother? 
BELLE That's the only story Papa could never bring himself to tell. And I knew better than to ask... 
As she speaks, the beast notices something on a chair.   The dark, pointed mask of a plague doctor. He looks up. 
THE BEAST Plague. 
The revelation lands on Belle's face.   She looks around. 
IN QUICK TIGHT SHOTS --- 
Gaston signals to Tom, Dick, and Stanley -- and Maurice turns to see them block the exit. Gaston places his large hand on Maurice's shoulder -- and squeezes. Maurice winces. 
GASTON (CONT'D) Everything's going to be fine. 
89   INT. BEAST'S LAIR - WEST WING - CASTLE - EVENING              89 
The beast sits in a tub -- far too small for him.   There's shadow-play on the curtain. 
BEAST I saw her in the ballroom, and I said, well, you're making this so beautiful, we should have a dance tonight. I never thought she'd actually say yes! What was I thinking?! 
LUMIÈRE No, Master, it's perfect! The rose has only four petals left. Which means tonight... you must tell her how you feel. 
The beast stands, appearing above the curtain, sopping wet. 
THE BEAST I feel like a fool. She will never love me. 
LUMIÈRE Do not be discouraged. 
The beast shakes his coat dry like a dog.   The spray extinguishes Lumière's candles. 
LUMIÈRE (CONT'D) She is the one. 
THE BEAST I wish you'd stop saying that! 
CUT TO: 
The beast plops into his a seat in front of the mirror. 
THE BEAST (CONT'D) There is no one. 
LUMIÈRE You care for her, don't you? Well then, woo her with beautiful music and romantic candlelight... 
PLUMETTE Yes, and when the moment's just right... 
THE BEAST But how will I know? 
COGSWORTH You will feel slightly nauseous. 
LUMIÈRE Don't worry, master, you'll do fine. 
MRS. POTTS Just stop being a coward and tell Belle how you feel. And if you don't, I promise you'll be drinking cold tea for the rest of your life. 
LUMIÈRE In the dark. 
PLUMETTE Covered in dust. 
LUMIÈRE Dark and very very dusty. 
Off the beast, taking this in -- 
CUT TO: 
89A   A brief MONTAGE, as the castle staff give the beast a very 89A bad makeover. 
LUMIÈRE (CONT'D) Start with the hair! Women love nice hair. 
MRS. POTTS I'll take the fingers and toes! 
COGSWORTH Chapeau, brush those teeth! 
Chapeau wields scissors and a brush as Mrs. Potts pours hot water into Chip. The beast is pushed and pulled, primped and snipped. His fingers are dipped into Chip, his nails buffed by Mrs. Potts' steam, as Lumière climbs onto his horns. 
LUMIÈRE Dip dip, snip snip... 
Plumette powders the beast's face -- 
PLUMETTE Eyes closed, poof poof! 
LUMIÈRE And the pièce de résistance... 
Chapeau places one of the Prince's old wigs on the beast. Plumette pecks his cheek with a beauty mark. The beast spins in 
his chair to see himself in the mirror, and -- he's totally ridiculous. The staff, dejected, takes in its handiwork. 
LUMIÈRE (CONT'D) OK, I can fix this! 
90   INT. BELLE'S BEDROOM - CASTLE - EVENING                   90 
Garderobe finishes dressing Belle. 
GARDEROBE Beautiful.     But something is missing. 
Garderobe looks up. There's dust around the gilding that glows in the moonlight. A moment of inspiration. 
THE BEAST You must go to him. No time to waste. 
Belle looks at the beast as she has never done before -- with gratitude and appreciation. She moves to return the mirror. 
THE BEAST (CONT'D) No. Keep it with you. And you'll always have a way to look back on me. 
BELLE Thank you. 
She rushes out. 
94A   INT. FOYER - CASTLE - NIGHT                              94A 
Belle runs down the grand staircase towards the door. She stops, seeing Chapeau. He bows to her, silently, sadly. Choking back tears, she is gone. 
Chapeau looks up to the landing, and sees Mrs. Potts standing there, watching. Heartbroken. 
94B   INT. BEAST'S LAIR - WEST WING - CASTLE                   94B 
The beast unclasps his beautiful coat and lets it fall to the ground. Cogsworth enters, eager for news. 
COGSWORTH Well, master, I may have had my doubts, but everything is moving like clockwork. True love really does win the day! 
THE BEAST I let her go. 
COGSWORTH You... WHAT!? 
Lumière and Plumette enter behind Cogsworth, followed by Mrs. Potts. 
LUMIÈRE Master... how could you do that? 
THE BEAST I had to. 
COGSWORTH But why? 
The beast doesn't answer. 
MRS. POTTS Because he loves her. 
LUMIÈRE Then why are we not human? 
COGSWORTH (angry) Because she doesn't love him!    And now, it's too late. 
PLUMETTE But she might still come back -- 
THE BEAST No. I've set her free. I'm sorry I couldn't do the same for all of you. 
He turns away, unable to face them. 
THE BEAST (CONT'D) Now go.     Our time is almost past. 
The staff retreats.    As "EVERMORE" begins, the beast pulls on a dark cape. 
THE BEAST (CONT'D) I   was the one who had it all I   was the master of my fate I   never needed anybody in my life I   learned the truth too late 
95   INT./EXT. TURRETS - CASTLE - NIGHT                          95 
He steps onto the balcony of his lair. From his POV, we see Belle mounting Philippe on the castle grounds below. 
THE BEAST I'll never shake away the pain I close my eyes but she's still there I let her steal into my melancholy heart It's more than I can bear 
Belle sets off and the beast begins to climb the castle turrets. 
THE BEAST (CONT'D) Now I know she'll never leave me Even as she runs away She will still torment me, calm me, hurt me, move me come what may 
The beast climbs higher and higher, to keep Belle in sight as she gets further and further away. 
THE BEAST (CONT'D) Wasting in my lonely tower Waiting by an open door I'll fool myself she'll walk right in And be with me for evermore 
The beast climbs, Belle riding, until he reaches the highest turret of the castle. 
THE BEAST (CONT'D) I rage against the trials of love I curse the fading of the light Though she's already flown so far beyond my reach She's never out of sight Now I know she'll never leave me Even as she fades from view She will still torment me, be part of everything I do Wasting in my lonely tower Waiting by an open door I'll fool myself she'll walk right in And as the long long nights begin I'll think of all that might have been Waiting here for evermore 
The beast stands at the edge of the turret as Belle finally disappears through the castle gates. 
96   EXT. VILLAGE OF VILLENEUVE - SQUARE - NIGHT                  96 
A horse-drawn asylum wagon thunders into the square where Maurice is surrounded by taunting villagers. The eerie driver, MONSIEUR D'ARQUE, steps out as Tom, Dick and Stanley throw Maurice into his cage on wheels. Villagers approach the wagon like 18th century rubberneckers. 
Gaston leans into the wagon. The gathering crowd is just loud enough to mask a private plea to Maurice... 
GASTON Have you ever seen the inside of a mad house, Maurice? You wouldn't last a week. Just give me your daughter's hand, and I'll set you free. 
MAURICE Never. 
JEAN Set to sacrifice our children To his monstrous appetite! 
CLOTHILDE He'll wreak havoc on our village If we let him wander free! 
GASTON So it's time to take some action, boys It's time to follow me! 
Gaston grabs a TORCH from a villager and tosses it into a barrel of pitch. Flames rise to the sky. 
GASTON (CONT'D) Through the mist, through the wood Through the darkness and the shadows It's a nightmare but it's one exciting ride 
Gaston lights Clothilde's torch, then clasps the shoulder of Monsieur d'Arque, who watches helplessly as his asylum wagon horses are commandeered by the mob. 
GASTON (CONT'D) Say a prayer, then we're there At the drawbridge of a castle And there's something truly terrible inside It's a beast, he's got fangs razor sharp ones Massive paws, killer claws for the feast Hear him roar, see him foam But we're not coming home `Til he's dead, good and dead... KILL THE BEAST! 
Some villagers seize shovels, pitchforks, axes. Some light torches in the pitch. Others wrench a boar's head PIKE STAFF from outside the country inn. Pere Robert tries to calm the frenzy but the force of the mob pushes him back. 
MOB Light your torch, mount your horse! 
GASTON Screw your courage to the sticking place 
MOB We're counting on Gaston to lead the way 
97    EXT. WOODS - NIGHT                                          97 
Gaston and LeFou crash into the woods at a full gallop. 
GASTON Call it war Call it threat You can bet they all will follow For in times like this they'll do just as I say 
LeFou's doubts are growing: 
LEFOU There's a beast Running wild there's no question But I fear The wrong monster's released 
MOB Sally forth, tally ho Grab your sword, grab your bow Praise the Lord and here we go! 
Gaston holds up the mirror. 
GASTON Show me the castle! 
IN THE MIRROR -- Gaston sees the hidden path to the castle. 
100   INT. FOYER - CASTLE - NIGHT                                100 
Plumette's head rests on Lumière's shoulder.    Mrs. Potts nuzzles Chip. 
LUMIÈRE At least he has finally learned to love. 
COGSWORTH A lot of good that does us if she doesn't love him in return. 
MRS. POTTS No. This is the first time I've had any real hope she would. 
ANGLE ON CHIP -- he hears a distant sound -- the rumble of MARCHING BOOTS -- puzzled, he hops to the window embrasure -- 
CHIP Did you hear that, mama?    Is it her!? Is she coming back?! 
The staff and Froufrou jump up, excited, and move to the window. They see torches in the distance. 
LUMIÈRE Could it be? 
They look through the glass, distorted with frost, as the mob moves through the garden. Lumière warms the windowpane with his flame to see more clearly. 
LUMIÈRE (CONT'D) Sacrebleu!     Invaders. 
MRS. POTTS Ruffians! 
COGSWORTH Well, there you go. So much for true love. Man the barricades, and hold fast! 
They hop down from the embrasure. 
102   INT. FOYER - CASTLE - NIGHT                              102 
Lumière, Cogsworth, Mrs. Potts, Chip, Plumette and Chapeau stand at the front door, forming a sad barricade. 
CASTLE STAFF Hearts ablaze, banners high We go marching into battle -- Unafraid although the danger just increased 
CADENZA Move aside! 
Cadenza crab-walks in from the ballroom, standing vertically and propping himself against the door. The others gather around him. 
103   EXT. TERRACE - CASTLE - NIGHT                            103 
The mob hauls their boar's head battering ram up to the door. 
MOB Raise the flag, sing the song Here we come, we're fifty strong And fifty Frenchmen can't be wrong Let's kill the beast! 
GARDEROBE (shock becomes rage) I'm coming, my love! That's it!     The fat lady is singing! 
Garderobe belts out a deafening high note and throws her massive girth off the balcony, sending Clothilde and the villagers below scattering. She lands with a graceful THUD. 
CADENZA Bravissima! 
Before the villagers can retaliate, Cadenza's "teeth" shoot out of his mouth like machine gun rounds. BAM BAM BAM! 
Lumière runs around with gunpowder trail, creating a line of firecracker explosions that send villagers scattering. 
LUMIÈRE Watch your toes! 
In the chaos, we find Agathe, moving quietly through the villagers and up the stairs. What is she up to? 
As villagers pour out the doors, Lumière and Cogsworth meet at the base of the stairs. 
LUMIÈRE (CONT'D) Bon voyage! Safe trip home! 
COGSWORTH And stay out! 
127   EXT. CASTLE GROUNDS - NIGHT                                   127 
Belle rides Philippe towards the castle.     She kicks his flanks and they double their speed. 
129   EXT. HIGHEST TURRET - CASTLE - NIGHT                          129 
Gaston steps slowly up onto the beast's turret. The beast senses his presence, turns. They lock eyes. Gaston cocks his pistol. 
GASTON Hello, beast. I am Gaston.    Belle sent me. 
130   INT. TURRET STAIRCASE - CASTLE - NIGHT                        130 
Belle races up the stairs to the turret. 
131   EXT. HIGHEST TURRET - CASTLE - NIGHT                          131 
With no hope left, the beast turns away from Gaston, whose finger tightens on the trigger. 
GASTON Were you in love with her? Did you honestly think she'd want you? 
He fires.   The beast drops over the edge. 
On the turret below, his claws make contact with the slanted rooftop and break his fall. He hugs the rooftop, heaving. 
Gaston looks down over the edge of the turret. He pulls his crossbow and reaches back over his shoulder to draw an arrow from his quiver -- but there's nothing there. 
Gaston spins to see Belle, and his arrows gripped in her hands. 
GASTON (CONT'D) Belle? 
BELLE Where is he?! 
With that, Belle snaps Gaston's arrows over her knee, and tosses them away. Gaston grabs her arm. 
GASTON When we return to the village, you will marry me, and the beast's head will hang on our wall! 
BELLE NEVER. 
She pulls away -- and uses this pivot to grab the barrel of Gaston's pistol. They struggle. 
With Gaston on the back foot for a split second, Belle yanks the 
pistol hard. Gaston, not letting go, swings with it, and seeking balance on a loose stone, he drops off the side of the turret! 
Gaston's reflexes are quick. He lets go of the pistol, grabbing 
a gargoyle and swinging himself down through a window of the turret. He lands on the spiral staircase. 
Gaston's pistol, in the meantime, clatters down, coming to rest on the landing of a stone footbridge below. 
132   EXT. CASTLE - VARIOUS TURRETS - NIGHT                       132 
Wounded, the beast climbs around the lower turret. All around him, turrets quaver and crack. The castle is imploding. 
GASTON (O.S.) I'm coming for you, beast! 
Gaston continues down until he reaches the bottom of the spiral staircase. He drops to a window box below, and jumps sideways onto another. 
The beast makes a second leap, onto another parapet.   Tiles slide away beneath him as he scrambles to hang on. 
Belle reaches the landing at the bottom of the spiral staircase, and leaps down onto another adjacent landing. She looks out, trying to see the beast through the turrets. 
The beast swings around a third parapet and leaps onto another. He's now as far as he can get from Gaston. 
As villagers stagger away in defeat, Lumière turns to Plumette, takes her in his arms, about to give her a V-Day kiss. 
LUMIÈRE We did it, Plumette.   Victory is ours. 
Plumette is silent in Lumière's embrace. 
LUMIÈRE (CONT'D) Plumette...? Oh! My dear Plumette... 
Cogsworth helps Lumière lower Plumette to the ground. Opposite them, Garderobe stands beside Cadenza, reunited at last. 
GARDEROBE Oh, maestro! You were so brave! Goodbye, my love... 
Her arms retract -- as the footlights inside her dim and die. 
CADENZA Darling!   No, don't leave me! 
Cadenza sobs. We move along the few keys he has left until they freeze into silence. We TILT UP to the music stand. No hint of a face. Froufrou emerges from the foyer, pawing at his master and mistress, then goes still. Nothing more than a piano stool now. 
Mrs. Potts frantically approaches Cogsworth and Lumière. 
MRS. POTTS CHIP! CHIP! Have you seen Chip!? He ran off! Oh, where is my little boy -- 
Lumière and Cogsworth watch in horror as Mrs. Potts' face disappears into the painted ornamentation of the tea pot. 
CHIP Mama! 
Lumière turns to Cogsworth, panicked that Chip might see what's happened. 
COGSWORTH Oh no. 
Just as he leaps up, his features fade away and gravity takes over. The saucer plummets, shattering. But Chapeau catches Chip in mid-air -- and lovingly places him, inanimate, onto the trolley cart beside Mrs. Potts. 
Chapeau straightens himself nobly, and becomes a coat rack. All around Cogsworth and Lumière, the staff goes still. 
COGSWORTH (CONT'D) Lumière... I... TICK... can't... CHIME... speak... 
LUMIÈRE It's all right, Cogsworth. 
COGSWORTH I... can't... TICK... Lumière, my friend... TOCK... it was an honor to serve with you. 
The only sound Cogsworth makes is `tick tock, tick tock.' Lumière is alone. Surrounded by objects. 
LUMIÈRE The honor was mine. 
Lumière does a final twirl and stiffens.      He is a candlestick. 
136   INT. BEAST'S LAIR - WEST WING - CASTLE - NIGHT               136 
ANGLE ON THE BELL JAR. The final rose petal drops -- just as a HOODED FIGURE appears. We move up to reveal: AGATHE. 
BELLE (to the beast) Please, don't leave me.    Come back. 
TIGHT ON BELLE -- her lips touch the beast's forehead in a kiss. 
BELLE (CONT'D) I love you. 
Hearing these words, Agathe smiles benevolently and places her hand on the bell jar -- which explodes and releases a wave of rose petals, whirling into the air. 
A golden light begins to emanate from Agathe. It encircles the beast and he too begins to rise. Belle gets to her feet, watching as the beast is lifted and enveloped by the swirling aurora, and then buffeted gently back down to reveal -- 
THE PRINCE 
He lands on his feet and looks down at his hands, his arms, his chest. He turns -- and sees Belle. 
PRINCE Belle... 
Slowly he steps toward her, and she to him. 
In silent disbelief, Belle runs her fingers through his hair. She looks into the Prince's blue eyes. It is him. Tears of grief turn to tears of joy as they lean in for their first kiss. 
137   EXT. CASTLE - DAWN                                            137 
Magic explodes outwards. And with it, the dawn breaks. The castle transforms like someone is giving it a wash of gold. The magic spreads across the balcony as the sun rises on the terrace, traveling down the castle facade -- creepy stone gargoyles turn into noble statuary -- 
138   EXT. TERRACE - CASTLE - DAWN                                  138 
As the light passes over, an upside-down FROUFROU transforms back into a tiny BICHON FRISE basking in the sun. He leaps up and chases his tail (still a tassle), then trots over to CHAPEAU 
and relieves himself on his leg -- which changes into a human foot. 
Chapeau transforms back into a VALET and shoos the dog   away with his walking stick. As the dog weaves through his    legs, the valet loses his balance and bumps into the trolley   cart holding Mrs. Potts and Chip. It starts to roll toward    the stairs. 
The valet backs into Garderobe, who waddles in and out of sunlight, changing from wardrobe to human to wardrobe again. Cadenza's face comes alive as he sees the wardrobe falling onto him. As it crashes, the wardrobe's doors fly open, sending out a flurry of garments. We follow them back to the ground, where the human DIVA now lies on top of the human MAESTRO.

DAY OF THE DEAD (The original script) by George A. Romero 
FADE IN: 
1	EXT. THE EMPTY STREET OF A CITY - DAY 
No people. A FEW CARS AND TRUCKS are parked at odd angles, abandoned. A TITLE FADES IN, one phrase at a time. 
FIVE YEARS... SINCE THE DEAD FIRST WALKED. 
2	EXT. THE CITY - DAY 
We hear THE SOUND OF A STRONG WIND. DEBRIS flutters through the streets. A LARGE ALLIGATOR slithers into frame, stops and looks around. 
MONTAGE: as MORE GATORS explore the empty streets, knocking over GARBAGE CANS, upsetting the MANNEQUINS in A DEPARTMENT STORE WINDOW. A GATOR crawls out through the open doors of AN ABANDONED BANK. LOOSE BILLS are dragged along under the animal's tail. They flutter away on the WIND. 
3	EXT. THE CITY - DAY 
GATORS crawl over A '79 CADELLIC. A FEMALE SKELETON sits slumped over the steering wheel. In the back a BABY'S BONES are strapped into AN INFANT'S SAFETY SEAT. One of the gators THUMPS its tail maddeningly against the windshield. ANOTHER TITLE APPEAR: 
FLORIDA - 1987 
4	EXT. THE CITY - DAY 
CLOSE ON A SECTION OF PAVEMENT as we hear THE SOUND OF SLUGGISH FOOTSTEPS approaching. A SHADOW appears at the bottom of the frame. It gets longer and takes on the shape of a man. 
TIGHT ON THE AFTERNOON SUN, blinding us. Into the FOREGROUND lurches THE FIGURE which cast the shadow. Glare obscures all facial detail until the head jogs into position directly in front of the fiery ball in the sky. Then we see its hideous, dead eyes, its blue-grey colour, the blackened wound where a large portion of jaw has been ripped away. This is a ZOMBIE! A MUSIC CHORD SOUNDS and THE MAIN TITLE APPEARS: 
DAY OF THE DEAD 
5	EXT. THE CITY - DAY 
HEAD CREDITS ROLL over A MONTAGE: the CITY STREETS are now populated by the WALKING DEAD. In every shape, size and colour they wander, without purpose, up and down the avenues, in and out of buildings. The city is theirs, they have inherited the place. Man, in his human form, seems to be gone. 
As the CREDITS END, we CUT TO: 
6	EXT. A MAIN STREET - DAY 
We are looking down from a HIGH ANGLE. The corner of A TALL BUILDING is in the FOREGROUND. A CORPSE is dangling from A NOOSE. It's been dead for some time. It's mostly bone now, its blackened flesh picked clean by scavenger birds and harbour rats. A SIGN flaps against its chest cavity. Its hurriedly scrawled message reads: TAKE ME, LORD! I LOVE YOU! 
THE ROPE BREAKS suddenly and THE CORPSE FALLS out of frame. 
7	EXT. THE STREET - DAY 
We're at GROUND LEVEL now...SMACK!!! THE CORPSE HITS THE PAVEMENT and SHATTERS as though made of potter's clay. BONES bounce over a wide area. THE SIGN is carried off by the WIND. 
8	EXT. AN ABANDONED MARINA - DAY 
THE SIGN gallops across the grass of A HARBOUR PARK towards the water where A FEW DERELICT BOATS sway in the WIND. 
Slowly, THE SOUND OF A MOTOR FADES IN. 
9	EXT. THE MARINA (CLOSER ANGLE) - DAY 
A FISHING BOATS, old and sea-worn, chugs into the harbour. 
10	EXT. THE MARINA (CLOSE ON THE FISHING BOAT) - DAY 
There are people on board, THREE MEN AND TWO WOMEN. They look like guerilleros from somewhere in Latin America. They're heavily armed, unshaven, covered with months worth of jungle crud. They are obviously exhausted. They gaze up to the city. Their deep-sunken eyes are too war-weary to show much emotion but we can read their despair. 
TONY Another dead place. I tol' you. Let's get out to the islands. 
MIGUEL The radio signals were coming from this area. 
TONY sees the action. He dives into the fishing boat, crawls over to his RIFLE and scrambles towards the pilot's controls. 
With a lightning move, MARIA pulls A KNIFE from her belt. She wrenches around and PLUNGES THE BLADE INTO HER ATTACKER'S CHEST. The man staggers back, screaming. MARIA breaks away and runs across the dock. THE MAN FIRES HIS PISTOL wildly. 
MARIA IS HIT IN THE ARM. She tumbles forwards onto the decking. 
TONY reacts, OPENING FIRE WITH HIS AUTOMATIC. 
BULLETS RIP INTO THE ATTACKERS CHEST: HE FALLS OUT OF THE TRAWLER onto the dock, but TWO MORE GUNMEN appear behind him, mean-looking desperadoes with RIFLE SPITTING LEAD. 
TONY ducks as low as he can. He grabs the controls and pilots the fishing boat along the edge of the dock toward the downed woman. 
18	EXT. THE PRIVATE DOCK - DAY 
MIGUEL, SARAH AND CHICO react to the gunfire. They draw their WEAPONS and look for cover. 
They are at the far end of the dock, their backs to the sea. There is a WORK SHED nearby. BULLETS WHIZ past them as they charge towards the wooden structure. They make it there safely and they begin to RETURN FIRE. A gun battle ensues between the two groups. 
19	EXT. THE PRIVATE DOCK - DAY 
MARIA, her ARM BLEEDING, rolls off the dock and into THE FISHING BOAT. TONY guns the engine and the boat pulls out into open water. 
THE ATTACKERS try to FIRE AT THE ESCAPING BOAT but they are forced to duck BULLETS which RICOCHET OFF THE TRAWLER pinning them down. 
20	EXT. THE PRIVATE DOCK - DAY 
MIGUEL'S RIFLE is in his right hand. His left hand clings to the frame of AN OPEN WINDOW on his side of the shed. There's a SUDDEN, STARTLING MUSIC STING and, with it, A ZOMBIE appears inside the open window. Grotesque and drooling dark SALIVA, its hungry mouth lunges at MIGUEL'S left arm. ITS TEETH TEAR A LARGE STRIP OF FLESH OUT OF THE ARM six inches above the wrist. 
MIGUEL screams. He pulls away from the creature, his terrified eyes staring at the BLEEDING WOUND. A zombie bite means infection and almost certain death. 
THE ZOMBIE leans out through the open window, its hands clawing the air trying to reach MIGUEL. SARAH pulls A GIANT .45 from her holster belt. BULLAMN! BULLAMN! BULLAMN! She FIRES three rapid shots. 
THE SKULL OF THE ZOMBIE INDENTS IN FRONT like a hard-boiled egg shell that's been whacked with a spoon bowl. BLACKENED BLOOD AND BRAIN MATTER FLIES OUT OF THE BACK where the bullets exit. The creature falls, destroyed. 
21	EXT. THE PRIVATE DOCK - DAY 
SARAH acts quickly. She lunges towards CHICO and snatches A MACHETE out of his belt. CHICO shows concern but he's busy RETURNING FIRE at THE ATTACKERS on the trawler. 
SARAH I have to stop the infection... Querrida... MIGUEL looks into SARAH'S eyes. He has started to tremble. A cry of primal panic is gurgling up in his throat. With a sudden move, SARAH slams her RIFLE BUTT into the side of his head with all her might. He reels backwards and slams into the boathouse wall. His eyes roll but he stays on his feet, still conscious. 
CHICO steps away from his post and stands squarely in front of MIGUEL. WHAP! He slugs him with a powerhouse right-cross. MIGUEL still stands. WHAP! He slugs him again. WHAP! Again. Finally, MIGUEL collapses into the man's arms and CHICO lays the limp body down on the deck. 
BUDDABLAM! RATTATATTATATTATATT! THE ENEMY, sensing an upper hand, starts FIRING WITH MORE INTENSITY. CHICO steps away from MIGUEL and SENDS SOME LEAD BACK their way. 
22	EXT. THE PRIVATE DOCK - DAY 
SARAH is crying. It's not weakness. She's crying for MIGUEL, crying for his pain. But she doesn't hesitate in what she has to do. She crouches over the BITTEN ARM and raises the MACHETE over her head. 
THUCK! SHE CHOPS AT THE ELBOW JOINT with all her strength. THE BLADE BITES DEEP BUT DOESN'T CUT THROUGH. SHE LIFTS IT AND CHOPS AGAIN AND AGAIN....THUCK! THUCK! Then SHE DIGS AROUND, searching for the joint the way she might on a turkey drumstick. Finding the spot, SHE PUSHES DOWN WITH BOTH HANDS, leaning all her weight on the top edge of the blade. TEARS are running down her cheeks when THE BIG KNIFE FINALLY.... THUMMMPPP!....CUTS THROUGH TO THE DECKING. 
Repulsed, angry, SARAH SWEEPS THE SEVERED FOREARM AWAY WITH THE BLADE the way a butcher might sweep away unwanted fat. BLOOD IS SPURTING OUT OF THE STUMP at an alarming rate. SARAH has to act quickly again. 
While CHICO continues to RETURN FIRE at the enemy, SARAH swings herself up onto the sill of the open boathouse window and disappears inside the place. 
23	INT. THE BOATHOUSE - DAY 
The place is dark and cluttered (oars, bait buckets, fishing gear, life preservers, tools, paints, varnishes). SARAH snatches up AN AXE HANDLE. 
THE ZOMBIE that bit Miguel lies nearby with its skull laid open. Its hand is jogged, startingly, when SARAH grabs A BOTTLE OF PAINT THINNER from the floor beside the corpse. 
From out of the shadows...A HAND! It grabs SARAH'S ankle. She kicks violently and pulls away. ANOTHER ZOMBIE is crawling across the floor. ONE OF ITS LEGS IS MISSING AND THE OTHER IS BADLY DAMAGED. 
SARAH draws her .45 and BULLAMM! BULLAMM! SHE PUMPS TWO ROUNDS INTO THE CREATURE'S BRAIN. 
SARAH Help me get him to the boat. 
CHICO Leave him. 
SARAH calmly raises her .45 and aims it directly at CHICO's head. 
SARAH Help me or die. 
Reluctantly the man moves towards MIGUEL and the two survivors drag his limp body over the decking. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
28	EXT. THE PRIVATE DOCK - SUNSET 
The fishing boat is gone. Orange light from the western horizon paints the scene. FIGURES are moving about on the dock, slumped, lumbering figures....ZOMBIES. 
They're clustering around THE TRAWLER, around THE CORPSES OF THE ATTACKERS. 
THEY BEGIN PULLING THOSE CORPSES APART AND EATING THEM HUNGRILY. 
ONE CREATURE has found MIGUEL'S SEVERED FOREARM. IT PULLS A BIG CHUNK OFF THE THING WITH ITS TEETH. It chews for a time, ITS DROOL TURNING RED. Then it spits out MIGUEL'S WRISTWATCH as though it was a bothersome bit of bone. 
29	EXT. THE FISHING BOAT (IN DEEP WATER) - SUNSET 
THE TWO WOMEN hover over their wounded, TONY AND MIGUEL. CHICO steers the boat. Suddenly, TONY arches his back and screams in pain. 
TONY Aaaaaaah...my God...my God...I am heartily sorry...for having offended Thee....offended Thee... 
MARIA Shhhhh....Tony. Rest, rest. 
TONY I detest all my sins...because... because of Thy just punishment... because of Thy...just...punish... 
A coughing fit interrupts his Act of Contrition. From across the open cabin, from within SARAH'S arms, MIGUEL stares. His eyes have the glaze of a madman's eyes. Despite that, and despite the physical trauma he has endured, he seems remarkably in command. 
MIGUEL He is dying. I will end his pain. 
MIGUEL draws his PISTOL. 
MARIA NOOOOOOOOO! 
TONY ...but most of all because...they offend Thee, my God...Who art all good...and deserving...deserving of all my love... 
MIGUEL He is dying. He knows it. 
MARIA You are dying, too. 
MIGUEL No. The disease was cut away from me. I will live. I will live. 
TONY I firmly resolve...with the... with the help...the help of...of Thy grace... 
TONY collapses. A long, gurgling breath of surrender spills out of him and BLOOD TRICKLES FROM HIS LIFELESS MOUTH. 
MARIA Tony...TONY! 
The woman folds TONY'S corpse into her arms as though trying to give it life from her own wounded body. For a long moment there is only the CHUG-CHUG-CHUG of the tired engine. Then the woman, sensing something, turns back towards MIGUEL. His pistol is raised, aimed at TONY'S head. 
MARIA NO! YOU CAN'T! 
SARAH It must be done. You know this. It must by done to keep him from... 
MARIA It won't happen to him! It won't happen to him! You heard his prayer. His prayer will save him. He could never become one of...one of those... devils. 
MIGUEL Prayers have no power to save. The knife can save. It can cut the disease away. The bullet. It can shatter the brain where the evil takes seed. These are saviours...our new saviours...our only saviours. 
THE BOAT noses into a swamp water backwash. Tall reeds and cypress moss camouflage it completely. It's at though the boat is sailing right onto dry land. 
SHOCK CUT TO: 
35	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE INLET - DAY 
THWOCK! CLOSE ON A MACHETE. The blade chops into the top of a coconut. 
CHICO drinks the milk. SARAH sits on a nearby rock, her RIFLE AND A BACK-PACK full of supplies strapped over her shoulders. 
MIGUEL, his madman's eyes wide with excitement, is trotting urgently from spot to spot where a spectacular specie of sub-tropical plant grows. There are hundreds of them, six-feet tall and flowering. Their red-gold blossoms are shaped like trumpets hanging with their bells down. 
MIGUEL DATURA!!! DATURA!!! MIRA. DATURA!!! 
CHICO What's he saying? SARAH shrugs, not knowing. CHICO looks down at her, empathising. 
CHICO His madness....could be from shock. 
SARAH No. I didn't stop the infection in time. I know. (She speaks softly, matter-of-factly) Don't worry. When he dies, I won't be like Maria. I'll shoot him. 
MIGUEL DATURA!!! DATURA!!! DATURA METEL!!! 
36	EXT. THE INLAND JUNGLE - DAY 
THE GUERILLEROS hack their way through thick undergrowth with MACHETES. MIGUEL is ineffectual. He lags behind the others who are doing trailblazing. THE SOUNDS OF WILDLIFE, excited by the intruders, fill the close, humid air, sometimes beautiful, sometimes grotesque, sometimes startling. 
37	EXT. A SWAMPY AREA - DAY 
ALLIGATORS lurk and SNAKES slither among the reeds. A FOURTEEN FOOT GATOR opens its jaws wide making a SOUND LIKE ESCAPING STEAM. CHICO draws his PISTOL but SARAH reaches out to grab his hand. 
SARAH No. No shooting. Not until we're sure we're alone on this island. 
MIGUEL No. No, thank you. No ice. Straight up, please. No ice. Thank you. 
MIGUEL'S eyes roll up into his head. His knees buckle. SARAH grabs him under the arms barely keeping from falling face first into the muddy swamp water. CHICO comes to help. 
38	EXT. THE SWAMP - DAY 
THE TWO drag MIGUEL to the edge of dry land. They flop him onto his back and SARAH puts her canteen to his lips. 
MIGUEL NO ICE, I SAID!!! NOOOOO ICE!!! 
He slams his good hand against the canteen, knocking it away. It plops into the marsh water, its contents lost. 
MIGUEL Burn the church. Kill the priest and burn the church. Burn.... 
His mouth keeps on shaping words but no sound comes out. He squirms for a moment, then he seems to fall asleep. 
CHICO looks down at him. Unable to help, he moves off towards solid ground and disappears in the thick brush. After a time, SARAH follows after him. 
39	EXT. THE CAVE ENTRANCE - DAY 
CHICO is at the edge of a clearing when SARAH reaches him. His eyes are wide, frightened by what they see. 
In the ground before them there's AN ENORMOUS IRON PLATE, fifty feet by ten, all painted in brown and green camouflage patterns. 
SARAH What is it? 
CHICO I dunno. Landing pad for a helicopter? I dunno. 
Suddenly there's A GREAT RUMBLING, like the giant gears and pistons of a drawbridge being activated. The iron plate shudders and starts to move, downward, into the earth. SARAH AND CHICO duck into the nearby jungle. 
40	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CAVE ENTRANCE - DAY 
They seem to come from everywhere. Soon there are twenty or more. Most are tattered and ragged but others wear vests, the same type as worn by the platoon. These are solid colours, some white, some blue. None are red and none have orange circles. 
As THE ZOMBIES push in closer they seem to get agitated. They start growling and reaching out. THE MEN WITH THE CATTLE PRODS poke at the more unruly creatures and ZAPPING SOUNDS can be heard. 
The creatures form a kind of ragged queue, lining up in front of the "Good Humour" men. From inside their freezer cartons those men produce GREAT BLOODY CHUNKS OF RAW MEAT. THE ZOMBIES docilely take the hand-outs and go lurching out of the queue, some starting to eat immediately, others retreating into the cool of the jungle to enjoy a more private supper. 
50	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY 
SARAH What is that? Could that be....? 
Behind her, CHICO gets the dry heaves. He slams his hand into his mouth to keep from making noise. 
SARAH No. They must have gotten them to accept....other things. They wouldn't be feeding them with....they wouldn't... 
51	EXT. THE CLEARING - DAY 
The man in command of the platoon is obvious, strutting around while others do the dirty work. This is CAPTAIN RHODES. He's conscienceless, the low of the low, and a weasely-looking guy, to boot. He watches the operation almost hoping for trouble. (He loves to torture disobedient zombies.) 
Behind him, their AUTOMATICS ready, are SEVERAL TROOPERS especially assigned to protect the captain. One of these troopers is TOBY TYLER, a good guy. TOBY is revulsed by the scene in the clearing. He drops his head, almost gagging. RHODES notices. 
RHODES You'll get used to this, Tyler. It's the only way. They don't bite the hand that feeds. TOBY looks up. He can't conceal his contempt for the captain. RHODES reads it in his eyes and is about to say something when a SOUND distracts him. 
ONE OF THE RAG-TAG ZOMBIES is running amok. THE ZAPPERS poke at the creature but that just makes it angrier. 
RHODES GET THAT THING AWAY FROM THE OTHERS! BRING IT HERE! 
ONE TROOPER has A LONG POLE WITH A WIRE NOOSE ON THE END. He drops the noose over the wild zombie's head and the wire tightens, biting into the dead flesh on the thing's neck. The pole is long enough to control the creature while keeping it out of reach. 
52	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY 
SARAH watches, repulsed but fascinated. CHICO is still fighting the heaves. Without warning, A ZOMBIE looms up directly behind CHICO. The man jumps forward, terrified. He crashes into SARAH who spins and sees the danger. 
TWO MORE ZOMBIES appear. Then A THIRD. These have no vests. They're rag-tag, bad ass and hungry as hell. ONE OF THEM grabs SARAH. She manages to pull away but behind her CHICO panics. He raises his RIFLE and...RATTATATTATATT! 
53	EXT. THE CLEARING - DAY 
RHODES hears the GUNFIRE. He seems pleased. He grins. 
RHODES We have visitors. Let's go men. 
He moves slowly towards the thicket followed by TOBY TYLER AND SEVERAL OTHER SOLDIERS. He reaches down to his belt and pushes one of THREE BUTTONS on A UNIT that resembles a pager. ELECTRONIC BEEPS, like the ones we heard earlier, come from the unit, this time in a different pattern. 
THE RED COAT ZOMBIES respond quickly. They draw their PISTOLS and go marching off after their leader, grunting and snorting like bull apes. RHODES' grin breaks into a wide-open laugh. 
RHODES Hah! If only the rest of you ladies would obey orders the way they do. 
54	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY 
Their cover blown, SARAH now raises her RIFLE. BUDDABUDDA!!! 
THE SECOND ZOMBIE'S HEAD TURNS TO RED PULP and the thing pitches forward, dead. 
CHICO FIRES and THE THIRD ZOMBIE IS DESTROYED. 
Suddenly there is DISTANT FIRE, from the clearing. BULLETS WHIZ through the brush. The guerilleros duck for cover. 
55	EXT. THE CLEARING - DAY 
THE RED COAT ZOMBIES, shuffling forward abreast in a line, have OPENED FIRE. It's a grisly parody of foot-soldiering. The creatures are unsteady on their feet, their hands shake when they squeeze the stiff Army-issue triggers. BULLETS FLY this way and that, most of them grossly off target. 
RHODES THAT'S IT, YOU WORM-EATEN SLIME ! YOU FOUL- SMELLING, PUSS-FACED MAGGOTS! I TOLD YOU I'D FIND YOU REAL ACTION, DIDN'T I? YOU CORRUPTION! YOU FILTH! YOU'RE LEARNING! YOU'RE GETTING BETTER....GETTING BETTER...GETTING BETTER, YOU SCUM! 
The trooper beside TOBY is another young man whose nickname is TRICKS. He and TOBY exchange glances as they trudge along behind the captain and his zombie red coats. Their eyes tell us that they both think Rhodes to be insane, which of course he is. 
CHICO, in a state of blind panic, takes off along the edge of the thicket, his WOUND BLEEDING PROFUSELY. 
61	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY 
CHICO breaks through some brush to find himself face-to-face with TOBY TYLER'S GROUP OF SOLDIERS. He stops, reverses course, and ducks into a cluster of palms. ONE OF THE SOLDIERS FIRES. RATTATATTATATTATATT!!! 
BULLETS RIP THE PALM FRONDS APART. There's a scream and CHICO somersaults out into view. NEW WOUNDS BLEEDING ACROSS THE CENTER OF HIS CHEST. 
62	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY 
SARAH realises that this is her last chance to escape. She takes advantage of the confusion and the NOISE and bolts into the jungle at a full run. 
63	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY 
CHICO is still alive. He fumbles for his HOLSTERED PISTOL but before he can draw it THREE TROOPERS are on top of him. TRICKS tromps a boot on his hand. TOBY TYLER aims his RIFLE squarely at his sweating brow. 
CHICO Yes...yes, do it...please...you can't let me die this way...please. Destroy me. A bullet...in the head...I don't want to become...one of...one of them. 
TOBY looks down at the man, at his TERRIBLE WOUNDS, clearly fatal ones. TOBY clicks a shell into the firing chamber of his RIFLE. His finger is just sliding under the trigger shield when CAPTAIN RHODES strides up behind him. 
RHODES Take his weapon, Tyler. 
TOBY is startled by the voice at his back. He turns towards the captain, then he looks back down at the guerillero, hesitating.. 
RHODES Take his gun, ass hole. He still has the strength to pull a trigger. 
Reluctantly TOBY obeys, reaches down for CHICO'S PISTOL. 
CHICO Please...senor...destroy me...one bullet...please. RHODES Maybe. We'll have a little talk first. Then....maybe...I can help you out. String him up. 
THE THIRD SOLDIER reaches down and grabs the wounded guerillero under the arms. TRICKS stoops to help. CHICO screams in agony when he is moved. TOBY lunges in to help the others, thinking to ease the man's pain. 
RHODES They can handle it, Tyler. You've been buckin' for a shit detail lately so here's one you're gonna love. We've got two dead. Cut the heads off and get the bodies underground to the refrigerators. Fast. It's a hot day. 
TOBY grimaces but doesn't speak. He turns and moves briskly towards the clearing. RHODES watches him go. 
64	EXT. THE CLEARING - DAY 
TOBY nears the spot where MIGUEL lies sprawled in A POOL OF BLOOD. RHODES calls from the edge of the thicket. 
RHODES Tyler. Just our men. Not him. 
TOBY looks down at the remains of the one-armed guerillero. 
RHODES His head stays where it is. He and I never really had the chance to get acquainted. When he comes back...I'll get another shot at it... Ha ha ha ha... 
65	EXT. THE CLEARING - DAY 
CLOSE ON CHICO. He's dangling from A ROPE which is tied over a tall tree, his feet ten feet off the ground. 
ZOMBIES wander here and there. They've all received their rations. The picnic is breaking up now. Occasionally one of them gets surly but it doesn't amount to anything. SOLDIERS stand ready with ELECTRIC PRODS, OTHERS with GUNS. 
PARAPHERNALIA is being packed away. MEN CARRY EQUIPMENT in the direction of the elevator. 
RHODES walks up beneath where CHICO is hanging. He's careful not to step in too close. He doesn't want to get any DRIPPING BLOOD on his uniform. 
CHICO Please....shoot me. 
RHODES And if I don't? If I don't you'll come back after your death. You'll come back and find yourself hanging there...wanting to eat...needing to eat human flesh. You hate that thought, don't you? That's the ultimate sin for most of you fools, isn't it? 
CHICO is weeping now. With a found spurt of energy he struggles against the rope. No use. It only brings pain. 
RHODES After hanging up there a few days you will be mad for food...crazed! You will lust for it! YOU WILL BE WORSE THAN ANY OF THEM! 
JOHN I know you can. Like I said, we been watchin' you. 
McDERMOTT We better get as far away from here as we can. We can work the other side of the island tonight. 
JOHN (explaining) We found nine entrances to the Cave so far, and we ain't got the whole thing near charted yet. That's what we was doin' out here today. Huntin' for entrances. 
McDERMOTT Come on. They find a Bee done like this and they'll know somebody's been out walkin' where they shouldn't have been. 
JOHN bows his head over the downed ZOMBIE. He mumbles softly. We can't hear the words but we can tell that he's praying, reciting the good words over the corpse of the "white-coat". 
SARAH The man I was with...until today... believed that praying was for blind men who couldn't see the truth. 
JOHN How we gonna break the curse without a prayer or two. 
SARAH Curse? 
JOHN What is it if it ain't a curse? 
SARAH It's a disease. It's a...a bug...a parasite that infects the brain. 
JOHN That sounds like a curse to me. 
SARAH We thought we were escaping here. We thought we'd found an uninhabited island. Christ! This place is a worse nightmare than anything I've seen yet! 
JOHN I'm sure that's true, miss. And that's why we're doin' what we're doin'. What's happenin' underground here is just what Lucifer planned for this sinful race o' man. But we're gonna beat Lucifer. We're gonna put an end to what's happenin' here. 
SARAH Oh, what did I run into? A bunch o' Jesus nuts? Religiosos? Prayer won't stop a bullet from one of those storm troopers and prayer won't keep one of those monsters from eatin' your liver for lunch. 
JOHN That's why we didn't use prayers on this here white coat 'til after he was destroyed. We ready to fight when we have to. And we gotta fight now. 
SARAH Look. I BEEN fightin', mister. I been fightin' for what feels like a hundred years and I'm finished. I don't need religion. I don't need prayers. I need a couple guns and a couple hands. We can sail on outa here. Find another island where there ain't so much....traffic. 
JOHN You think you can find your boat? There's a thousand little inlets and backwaters all through here. You remember all the ways you turned to get where you are now? You leave yourself a trail? 
SARAH is stopped by this. She stares at the big man suspiciously, not sure whether to believe him. 
JOHN We didn't see the exact spot but we know about where you landed. But we ain't ready to take you there. Not yet. You see...we need guns, too. 
SARAH looks around her at the unlikely band of guerillas. She thinks for a moment...not very long...then she turns and starts off into the jungle. 
SARAH I can find it myself. I didn't come that far. 
JOHN Farther than you think. You'll get lost. You will. And there's Bees all through the jungle. I ain't lyin' to ya. Religiosos don't lie. 
SARAH No. They just try to hold you for ransom. Fuck you, Moses! I'm outa here! 
SARAH plunges into the brush and without so much as a look back over her shoulder she disappears. 
McDERMOTT We can't let her go, John. 
JOHN We don't need her guns that bad. Billy boy. (He's joking.) 
McDERMOTT The hell we don't! But that's not what I mean. She'll be dead in ten minutes out there alone. That or she'll be firin' off her automatics and wakin' up the troops. 
JOHN We'll split up. Billy, you go with Spider. Just an hour or two tonight, that's all. Rhodes might have extra guards on after all the commotion. We'll meet up at number six and go back home together. 
McDERMOTT God save us. And me with me flask dry. I'll never make it. 
THE GROUP splits up, moving off in two different directions through the darkening underbrush. 
78	EXT. SOMEWHERE IN THE JUNGLE - NIGHT 
DARKNESS has fallen. The jungle is as black as the background on a velvet painting. 
RHODES moves past OTHER CELLS, each holding A NICKNAMED RED COAT. GRUMPY stands way back in the shadows. TONTO stands near the bars, growling. FATSO is swaying back and forth like a chubby five year old who needs to pee. 
RHODES stops at A CELL marked "BUB!". Inside we see A SILHOUETTE, tall, erect, not moving a muscle. RHODES grins. 
RHODES Well, Bub. I've heard about you. Miss Henried's pride and joy. 
RHODES steps closer and BUB snarls warningly. 
RHODES Surly sonofabitch. I want to make friends, Bub. Friends. I have one more goodie in my sack here. 
A LOUD, CLANGING SOUND interrupts. RHODES turns to see. 
82	INT. THE DORMITORY - NIGHT 
MARY HENRIED AND JULIE GRANT have entered through A STEEL DOOR WITH ELECTRONIC LOCKS. THE ZOMBIES send up A CHORUS OF MOANS AND GROWLS. The women start down the corridor checking cells as they pass. Suddenly they stop in their tracks, their horrified eyes staring into A CELL marked "SAMSON!". 
SAMSON is nibbling on ANOTHER HEAD. Much of the flesh is already gone, but we can still recognise...CHICO. The zombie turns the thing up-side-down, reaches way inside, through the neck, and pulls out grey matter. 
JULIE backs away, fighting nausea. A spasm rises in MARY'S stomach as well and she reels away from the hideous sight. 
RHODES Come, come, Miss Science. You've seen worse. 
MARY God....damn you, Rhodes! 
RHODES God has damned us all. Are my atrocities worse than yours? 
MARY You have ruined weeks of work here! We've been trying to wean these specimens onto alligator meat! 
RHODES No wonder they're so....hungry. 
Suddenly JULIE SCREAMS, her hands flying to her mouth. 
THE PLASTIC BAG is still dangling from RHODES' GLOVED HAND. Inside, pressed into the thin plastic, we can see the rough outline of THE FINAL HEAD. THE THING IS SQUIRMING causing the whole bag to wiggle. 
RHODES drops the bag instantly to the floor. Taking care, he grabs the bottom by a loose corner and pulls up hard. THE HEAD ROLLS OUT AND SETTLES AGAINST A WALL. IT'S EYES ARE OPEN AND DARTING CRAZILY, ITS MOUTH IS CHEWING, GROTESQUELY, ON THE AIR. 
MARY stares in shock. JULIE runs towards the exit, trying to scream but gagging on her own acids. She's hysterical. 
RHODES calmly draws his PISTOL, cocks, and FIRES. THE SQUIRMING HEAD IS SHATTERED by the powerful bullet. 
83	INT. MARY'S OFFICE IN THE CAVE - NIGHT 
A 9 BY 12 CUBICLE with A SMALL COMPUTER TERMINAL, A DESK AND THREE CHAIRS. There's A LIGHTBOX on the wall displaying GROUPS OF CRANIAL X-RAYS. 
MARY guides JULIE GRANT into a chair. RHODES stands cockily in the open doorway. 
JULIE I didn't realise! Those were de-caps! I didn't know that....de-caps... revived! 
RHODES Any dead whose brains are intact will revive. 
JULIE But...we bury the heads. Oh. God! It must be torture for them! 
RHODES They are brutes without feeling. Though I admit that I've requested cremation for myself. Burial is an archaic tradition, even more ridiculous now than it ever was. To say nothing of the...spacing problem...on a small island like this. 
JULIE I thought the purpose of decapitation was to...to... 
RHODES The purpose of decapitation is to preserve as much...food...as possible. The purpose for feeding is to keep the beasts on our side. The fact that they can be taught to clean up our garbage or to fire a gun is a convenient side benefit, not the primary goal. The primary goal is to keep ourselves from becoming their supper. Keep them fed and they behave. Keep them hungry and they revert back to being the animals that they have always been. You saw them in there. 
MARY You gave them a fresh taste of blood! 
RHODES They will never be satisfied with anything else, Miss Henried. They want human flesh. I'm prepared to take whatever steps are necessary to see to it they don't get mine! Not while I'm still using it! 
JULIE has calmed herself down. Now she feels angry, betrayed. She looks at MARY accusingly. 
He turns and walks away. MARY stands still for a time, THE SOUND OF RHODES' CLICKING BOOTHEELS surrounding her, swallowing her. In the DEEP BACKGROUND we can HEAR THE MOANS OF THE CAGED DEAD. 
86	INT. THE CENTRAL CHAMBERS OF THE CAVE - NIGHT 
MONTAGE: as MARY walks through HUGE OPEN AREAS CARVED OUT OF NATURAL ROCK. We are stunned at the enormity of the place. JEEPS AND TRUCKS RUMBLE back and forth. Storage areas hold MOUNTAINS OF CRATES, CARTONS, WATER AND GAS CANISTERS. FORK LIFTS shift loads from here to there. 
MARY comes to a place where the natural rock surrenders to man-made walls. She enters past TWO SECURITY GUARDS, showing her I.D. 
87	INT. THE RESIDENCE - NIGHT 
MARY moves down A CORRIDOR with NUMBERED DOORS on both sides. We HEAR THE SOUND OF LIFE, MUSIC BLASTING, VOICES LAUGHING, ARGUING, CRYING. PEOPLE move by. A MAN AND A WOMAN are fighting. She slaps him, he punches her, she kicks him in the balls. THREE HOOKERS pound on a door. The door is opened by A NAKED MAN WEARING A DILDO on his nose. OTHER MEN, behind him, laugh wildly as the hookers enter their smoke- filled room. 
MARY stops in her tracks when she sees that outside A DOOR NUMBERED 83 (the door to her quarters) there are TWO OF RHODES' SOLDIERS with RIFLES in hand. The door itself is open and SHADOWS move inside. 
MARY turns quickly, before she is spotted, and starts back through the hallway. As she turns a corner she is grabbed by TOBY TYLER. 
MARY Toby...thank God...wait here. I gotta find out what's goin' on. 
TOBY Hey. Slow down. What is it? 
MARY Some of Rhodes' men. At the door. 
TOBY That bastard. I didn't think he'd make his move so fast. 
MARY It's because of me. 
TOBY Oh, bullshit, Mary. It's because Rhodes is a prick. 
MARY I want you to leave. Then maybe... 
TOBY We're both gonna leave. Leave the island. I've been talkin' to Tricks. We think we can smuggle out one of those inflatable rafts. They're crated up real small. They've got air canisters. There's food inside. Even a little motor. 
MARY I am not...a guerilla fighter, Toby. I'm not a pioneer. I'm not...I'm not strong that way. I need... 
TOBY Need what? Civilised order like we have down here? Christ! 
MARY I can work here. Maybe my work can help...help everyone. I can do more good with access to this equipment than I can off in some wasteland. 
TOBY For the good of mankind. That's what every monster-maker says. 
MARY looks into TOBY'S eyes. She's hurt, yet angry. The kind of anger that comes involuntarily when somebody strikes an already sensitive guilt-nerve. 
TOBY We're gettin' out. Me and Tricks. I want you to come with us. I want that more than anything. I'll send word. I'll let you know a time and a place to meet. We probably won't be able to wait around so if you're not there on the dot...well...if you're not there, I'll know you're not comin'. 
She grabs him, holding him tightly against her. They kiss, hard and long. TOBY pulls away, looks at her lovingly, then turns and starts toward the guarded apartment. MARY follows. 
TOBY (walking) I don't know what they're gonna do to me. I figure they'll just send me out to Stalag Seventeen but if...if it's worse than that...Tricks will know. Stay in touch with Tricks. 
As they approach the door to number 83, THE SOLDIERS there raise their RIFLE to ready positions. 
SOLDIER You Tyler? 
TOBY Yes. 
SOLDIER You're under arrest. I'll take your weapon. 
TOBY hands over his RIFLE and begins to unbuckle his PISTOL BELT. TWO MORE SOLDIERS appear from inside the open apartment. 
MARY What's he supposed to have done? What are the charges? 
SOLDIER Dunno, ma'm. We're on orders. 
MARY Look...I'm Mary Henried. I'm with the special conditioning center. I'm not without influence... 
JOHN It's a tunnel. It's a couple hundred yards. Just keep goin' 'til you reach the end. I'll be right behind you. 
SARAH starts down into the hole. JOHN and the others prepare to follow. JUNGLE SOUNDS cover the noises they make. 
92	INT. THE HOSPITAL IN STALAG SEVENTEEN - NIGHT 
We see ROWS OF HOME-MADE COTS, each with A BODY lying on top. What faces we see are gaunt, showing the boils and lesions of consumptive diseases and tropical fever. INSECTS BUZZ and there is THUNDER in the air. 
An Oriental orderly, LUKEY, moves through the maze of bodies. He lifts the wrist of A WOMAN WHO LOOKS DEAD and he discovers that she is dead indeed. He hurries off. 
93	INT. HOSPITAL OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT 
This is a room with walls, an operating room with JURY-RIGGED APPOINTMENTS. On A TABLE, under A HALF-DOZEN LIGHT BULBS, lies A CORPSE. Another orderly, a Nordic type names DIESEL, an enormous man, assists while DOCTOR LOGAN methodically SAWS OFF THE CORPSE'S HEAD. 
LUKEY rushes in out of breath. 
LUKEY Doc Logan! Doc Logan! Dere's a lady dead out dere! Gotta hurry! Gotta hurry! Dunno how long she been dat way! Maybe she gettin' ready to come back. 
THE CORPSE'S HEAD ROLLS AWAY FROM ITS BODY. DOC LOGAN picks up AN ELECTRIC DRILL WITH A LONG BIT. WHZZZZZZZZZ! HE DRIVES THE SPINNING BIT INTO THE DISEMBODIED HEAD, DEEP INTO ITS BRAIN. When he pulls it out, MATTER FLIES as the motor winds down. 
LOGAN is a middle aged man. He looks exhausted, demoralised, a bit mad. And he looks as ill as some of his patients. There are OPEN SORES on his face and he hasn't shaved for days. He's covered with two week worth of BLOOD STAINS. He starts around the table leaving DIESEL to dispose of the "DE-CAP". 
LOGAN Bury the head. Call the guard for the rest. Get it off the table for now. We'll bring this new one in. 
DIESEL doesn't respond right away. He's heard something. 
LOGAN What is it? 
DIESEL The tunnel. 
LOGAN hears it now, A SCRATCHING, SCUFFLING SOUND. He looks at his watch. 
LOGAN God. It's almost sun-up. 
LOGAN AND LUKEY move to a spot at the back of the room. They remove SEVERAL OF THE PLANKS in the floor. SARAH'S head pops out, gasping for air. Logan recoils, his eyes wide and frightened. 
LOGAN Who are you? Who are you? 
He stands up too quickly. Dizziness makes him reel. He smashes into AN INSTRUMENT CART, comes up with A LONG-BLADED SCALPEL and holds the thing threateningly aimed at the stranger. 
JOHN It's OK. It's OK, Doc. She's with us. 
In the next moment, SARAH and the others climb out of the tunnel. 
JOHN This here's the hospital. That's Diesel over there, the big guy. This here's Lukey and that's Doc Logan who's about to cut your tonsils out. 
SPIDER, the last one to climb into the room, quickly begins collecting WEAPONS, what few the rebels have. 
JOHN This here's all the weapons we got. That's why your fancy automatic looks so good to us. We gotta stick it over here with the others for now. They catch us with any kind o' weapon and its death without even askin' your name. 
SARAH lets SPIDER take her GUN. The deaf mute signs something which SARAH can't decipher. 
JOHN Ammunition. You got ammunition in your pack there? I hope you do or the gun ain't worth much. 
SARAH roots through her SUPPLY PACK and produces THREE LOADED CLIPS AND SEVERAL BOXES OF LOOSE SHELLS. JOHN notices SOME TINS OF FOOD, MEDICINES, A KNIFE, A COMPASS... 
JOHN We better just hide the whole pack, darlin'. That stuff is just shoutin' out that it come from the mainland. The shit we get is all C.D. rations. Aspirins and crackers from 1958. 
SPIDER snatches THE PACK away rather roughly. SARAH is a little disturbed by the action. THE MATERIAL is stashed under FLOOR BOARDS beside the tunnel entrance. 
JOHN Let's go. You look like you could use some shut eye. Me too. We can all get acquainted tomorrow. 
LUKEY escorts JOHN AND SARAH out of the operating room into the main hospital area. BILL McDERMOTT pulls out his empty flask. 
It resembles the hospital. There are ROWS AND ROWS OF COTS. SOME PEOPLE SLEEP, alone and in pairs. OTHERS are awake, drinking, screwing, shooting up. SARAH finds an empty cot and flops down. Beyond the open walls she can see THE BLUE-WHITE FLASHES coming from the electrified fence. RAIN LEAKS in on her but it doesn't keep her from falling asleep. 
97	INT. THE CONDITIONING ROOM IN THE CAVE - MORNING 
TECHNICIANS are working with ZOMBIES while ARMED GUARDS stand ready. We FOCUS ON A BLUE COAT. Under supervision, the thing is fumbling to tie a shoelace. It's failing miserably but trying hard. ANOTHER BLUE is busy placing LITTLE WOODEN SHAPES into their proper HOLES IN A BOARD. 
TWO RED COATS sit at a table attended by HUMAN TECHNICIANS. We've seen these zombies before, in the dormitory. TONTO, is...or was...a native American, probably Seminole. In front of him is A PLATE containing SEVERAL BITS OF MEAT. He has A FORK in his hand and he is idly stabbing at the meat. 
The other RED COAT, BLUTO, looks just like Bluto from Popeye, bulky with a thick, black beard. Tired of THE JIG SAW PUZZLE he's working on, he snarls and suddenly lunges for the meat on TONTO'S plate. He snatches a handful and stuffs it in his mouth. As soon as he tastes it, however, he pulls it back out, dribbling and spitting disgustedly. 
FISHER (a technician) They won't accept a substitute. They want their Alpo. 
TONTO has succeeded in forking a piece of meat. He moves it to his mouth and pops it in. 
FISHER Alright! Way ta go, Kemosabe! 
MARY HENRIED has entered the room. She pulls up and watches  TONTO with a kind of dubious interest. TONTO stops chewing. He looks up with exaggerated sadness on his face. Slowly his mouth opens and the chewed piece of meat slides out between his lips. He throws his fork down angrily. 
MARY They won't learn to use forks if they don't like the breakfast you're serving, Ted. 
FISHER The fork is like a game to them. If they get into the game maybe they'll learn to like the food. 
MARY It won't work. 
Suddenly BLUTO jumps up from the table. He flings his chair aside and tromps right over to MARY. His arms are outstretched and he is making a pleading, Karloff-like SOUND. GUARDS come after him but MARY waves them off. 
MARY It's alright! Leave him alone! 
MARY extends her right hand to meet BLUTO'S right and they shake vigorously. Then the dumb creature drops his arms and looks around. His brain sends no signal as to what he should do next. THE GUARDS lead him away. 
98	INT. THE FIRING RANGE IN THE CAVE - MORNING 
BLAM!!! A RED COAT is FIRING A PISTOL right AT THE LENS. 
CLOSE ON: A TARGET, a flat, cut out silhouette of a man, BLACK TRIANGLES painted on the instant-kill-zones, brain, heart. BULLETS STRIKE the neck, the to torso, SOME RICOCHET off the wall behind. None hit the kill-zones. 
MARY HENRIED enters. The place resembles a Police Department target range. RED COATS stand in stalls and FIRE down LONG ALLEYS at TARGETS which pop up against the opposite wall. THE NOISE is deafening. TWO TECHNICIANS are watching the shooters and keeping score. MARY walks up to one of them. 
MARY Have you seen Julie Grant this morning? 
TECHNICIAN She should be in the behaviour rooms. 
MARY She's not. Hasn't shown up yet. 
There's AN OFF-SCREEN GROAN, the sound of a zombie trying to communicate. MARY turns and sees the tall RED COAT names BUB standing in the closest stall trying to attract MARY'S attention. (He was the one Rhodes referred to last night as "Mary's pride and joy".) He is wearing WESTERN-STYLE GUN BELTS, SIX-SHOOTER hang in HOLSTERS on both his hips. MARY faces BUB full with her body and delivers a military salute. 
MARY Good morning, Bub. 
BUB replies with one of those pathetic sounds that obviously mean something to him. Then he, too, salutes. MARY pulls away, heading for AN EXIT, but BUB calls after her. He makes inarticulate sounds but we catch his drift. 
TECHNICIAN I think he wants you to watch. 
MARY OK, Bub. Do your stuff. 
BUB turns towards the target wall looking like a gunfighter on a western street. There's A HUMMING MECHANICAL SOUND. KATCHUNG! A SILHOUETTE pops up. BUB slaps leather...fast... lighting fast. BOTH GUN come up. BLAM-KA-BLAM-KA-BLAM-BLAM-BLAM-BLAM!!! 
HOLES APPEARS IN THE TARGET...WOP-WOPPETY-WHUMP!!! All in the kill- zones, or damn close. 
BUB slaps ONE PISTOL back into its HOLSTER. He clicks open the shell- chamber on THE OTHER, dumps the SPENT CARTRIDGES and begins to reload from his belt. 
MARY stares at the creature's back, mixed emotions showing on her face. BUB turns to face her. Dropping a bullet, he salutes again. MARY hesitates, then salutes back. 
MARY Very good, Bub. That's....very good. 
GASPARILLA Well, you managed ta make it here jus' in time fer this case, didn't ya? 
RHODES replaces THE PROSECUTOR on the floor. He smiles at MARY pointedly as he starts his speech. 
RHODES Sir. In the matter of the State versus Private Tyler, I don't want to... 
MARY (standing) Sir, Tyler is innocent of any crime against the State. Captain Rhodes is... 
GASPARILLA (with a mouthful of mango) Miss Henried, I think you better... 
MARY ...Captain Rhodes is trying to... 
GASPARILLA (spitting a wad of chewed pulp into his hand) MISS HENRIED, SHUT THE HELL UP!!! 
MARY'S eyes indicate her frustration and anger but she does shut up. GASPARILLA plops the handful of fruit pulp onto the floor wiping his fingers on his military jacket. 
RHODES I don't want to take up a lot of time with this. Mr Tyler shot a prisoner against orders. There are eyewitnesses. I've reprimanded Tyler and I've had him sent outside. It's as simple as that. 
GASPARILLA Ya had 'im sent ta the Stalag? That's all ya did to 'im? 
RHODES The prisoner was dying, sir. Tyler acted out of a sense of mercy. I don't believe Tyler to be dangerous, General. He just needs...discipline. Two or three months outside will teach him...discipline. 
MARY Sir. It's quite clear that... 
GASPARILLA SHUT UP, MISS HENRIED! I TOL' YA B'FORE! 
MARY THIS IS A TRAVESTY! CAPTAIN RHODES IS... 
GASPARILLA SIDDOWN, YOUNG LADY! I DONE YUP A SHIT-LOAD O' FAVOURS AND I AIN'T NEVER YET ASKED FER NOTHIN' IN RETURN! NOW HOW'D YOU LIKE TA SPEND TWO WEEKS UP T'THE VEGETABLE FARM YERSELF? THAT'S WHAT IT'LL BE IF YA DON'T SIDDOWN AN' SHUT THE HELL UP! 
MARY checks herself. There's a perverse air of danger fuming off the fat General. His attitude toward MARY has clearly changed. RHODES has been working on him. MARY seems to have lost this round. She can only hope that's all she's going to lose. 
GASPARILLA Now I think Captain's punishment is fair, considerin'. In fact I think you ain't got shit ta complain about. 
MARY (softly, carefully) I'm sorry, General, if I...spoke out of turn. It's just that...Mr Tyler is not here to defend himself. He has no representation. I don't believe due process is being served by... 
GASPARILLA Listen, Missy. I am the only due process that has ta be served aroun' tyere and one of the people doin' the servin' from now on is gonna be you. Now you been prancin' aroun' the Cave like yer ass was glass fer long enough! All that's 
GASPARILLA gonna change, young lady. Now if you still got a statement you'd like ta make, you can jus' hold onto it 'til tonight. 
MARY Tonight? 
GASPARILLA That's right. 'Bout eight, if that suits. We'll start out in my gymnasium an' progress on from there...to various other forms o' physical therapy. 
MARY shoots a hate-filled eye full at RHODES. THE CAPTAIN responds with a phoney look of sympathy. 
101	INT. GASPARILLA'S GYMNASIUM - NIGHT 
The place is full of EXERCISE EQUIPMENT, TREADMILLS, WEIGHTS, A NAUTILUS, ETC. There are other items which seem contradictory, PLUSH PILLOWS, A HUGE CIRCULAR BED SURROUNDED BY MIRRORS. Delicacies of FOOD AND DRINK lie about on LOW TABLES. The room is a cross between Elaine Powers and a harem chamber. 
A HUGE COFFIN-SHAPED DEVICE opens and we see that the inside is lined with ULTRAVIOLET TUBES which are covered with plexiglass. GASPARILLA lounges inside the thing, sweating, having just taken a long dose of fake sunshine. 
All around are THE COUNCILMEN, some with COUNTRY-CLUB TYPE WOMEN, conservatively dressed and wearing suitable jewellery (obviously wives left over from the good old days), and some with SCANTILY CLAD COURTESANS. 
OTHER SCANTILY CLAD "BUNNY" TYPES are serving HORS-D'OEUVRES and pouring WINE, offering SMOKE AND SNORT. 
MARY HENRIED is sitting on the floor, lost in fluffy pillows, her LAB COAT incongruous. RHODES watches her from nearby. 
GASPARILLA AWRITE. C'MON LADIES. OFF WITH IT... AND ON WITH IT...HA HA HA... 
MUSIC BLARES and SEVERAL OF THE COURTESANS spring up, stripping off what few clothes they are wearing. Some strip naked, others down to panties. They hop onto various exercise machines and begin to "workout", tits flopping, thighs pumping...GASPARILLA'S kind of entertainment. 
GASPARILLA Oh, Lordy, Lordy...I'm drunk as a skunk. Look at this...will ya jus' loooooook at these lovelies! Say, Henried, you ever try it with another woman? 
SARAH Let me go! I'm the one he wants. This is all happening because of me. If I turn myself in... 
JOHN He's just finding another reason for bumpin' us off. Don't ya see. He needs us ta die. He needs our bodies. 
Behind JOHN on the street TOBY TYLER is looking on. He has heard the conversation. JOHN turns and sees him. His eyes go dark with apprehension. 
TOBY It's alright. I'm a friend. I need help and so do you. What's a safe place to talk? 
JOHN Ain't no place safe. 
TOBY Look...I know you have no reason to trust me. I've got friends in the Cave. I got some stuff comin' out this mornin'. I'm gonna try to get off the island. 
PEOPLE are pushing in closer attracted by the commotion inside the Ritz. TOBY has to make it fast. He whispers. 
TOBY I'm gonna have this stuff sent over to the hospital... 
JOHN The hospital? (surprised, worried) 
TOBY Yeah. My stuff's all marked with red crosses so nobody gets too nosey. Meet me at the hospital after the supplies come in. Maybe we can find a place there to talk. 
JOHN Maybe. 
TOBY drifts off into the crowd. JOHN AND SARAH exchange glances. 
105	EXT. ENTRANCE TO STALAG SEVENTEEN - MORNING 
SUPPLIES are being brought in through THE MAIN GATES, CRATES, CARTONS, BAGS OF GRAIN, SEED, FERTILISER. 
TRICKS is in charge of the patrol from the Cave. He's checking items as they're picked up by WORKERS from the compound. TOBY TYLER sidles up to his friend. 
TOBY Hey, Tricks. Some detail they got you on. 
TRICKS Not as bad as yours, pal. 
TOBY (whispering) What'dya get? 
TRICKS Rafts. Two 38s. A little ammo. 
TOBY We need fuel, and a couple automatics. 
LUKEY, the orderly, picks up A DOLLY which is LOADED DOWN WITH CRATES MARKED WITH RED CROSSES. 
TRICKS Hey, you. Those two on the bottom. Don't open those yet. They might be from the wrong shipment. Just keep 'em around 'til I can check. 
LUKEY Yessir. I never open 'em. Nossir. I keep 'em innaback for you. 
106	EXT. FRONT STREET OF STALAG SEVENTEEN - MORNING 
Watching from the shadows of A BUILDING are JOHN, SARAH AND DIESEL. 
DIESEL He's a spy. A spy for Rhodes. 
JOHN Give him a chance. 
They see TOBY pull away from TRICKS and start down the street following LUKEY. They move out and catch up with TOBY, flanking him. 
JOHN What'dya tell that soldier, soldier? You tell him we was rebels? 
TOBY He's my contact for Chrissake! There's two crates. Can you get me into the hospital? 
SHORT CUT TO: 
107	INT. STORAGE BAY IN THE HOSPITAL - MORNING 
TOBY What about the people here in the camp? If they don't get blown to kingdom come their food'll be destroyed, their water, medical supplies. They won't have any more power. This island can't support them all, they'll be doomed. Count me out, friends. I'm gonna get my ass outa here. Anybody wants to come along is welcome. 
Silence falls over the room. Finally JOHN moves towards the door. TOBY follows but before exiting he turns back to face the group once more. 
TOBY I wanna see Rhodes burn just a much as you do...but all those people. We don't have the right to be their judges... just like they don't have the right to be our judges. 
JOHN opens the door and TOBY exits. SARAH follows. JOHN looks around at the faces in the group, then he leaves, shutting the door behind him. There's a long silence, then LOGAN speaks. 
LOGAN We know what we must do. It's written for us in the Bible. "They shall be driven from the land of the living down to the world of the dead. That is the fate of those who care nothing for God." 
109	INT. STORAGE BAY IN THE HOSPITAL - DAY 
LUKEY stands guard. McDERMOTT has joined SARAH AND JOHN in a strategy huddle. TOBY stands nearby, feeling strangely guilty. 
SARAH Toby's right. They're not gonna sit around with their fingers up their asses while we bust up their toys. 
JOHN Datura. 
SARAH What? 
JOHN Datura Metel. The Devil's Trumpet. Don't worry. I ain't goin' religioso again. It's a flower that grows on these islands. Where I come from the voodoo priests used it whenever they needed a Mickey Finn. It's toxic. Ground up you can put it in a drink or inject it...or...in a sealed area it might be introduced through the ventilation system. 
SARAH Datura! Miguel knew it! Datura, he was shouting! Datura Metel! 
JOHN We always planned to use it. We got some ground up already...but we could never find enough. 
SARAH There's hundreds of 'em. Right where we landed our boat. 
TOBY This stuff really works? No shit? 
JOHN Quicker than gas. And it smells a lot prettier. It usually don't kill but it puts ya under fer a good night's sleep. 
TOBY If you could knock out the central communications room you could foul up their whole intercom system. Then, if you move fast enough, stay ahead of 'em...without bein' able to signal each other, they might have a hard time catchin' you. 
JOHN I say it's poetic. Pure calypso, brother. The Devil's Trumpet blowin' the notes o' doom for the Devil's troops. Ha ha ha ha ha... 
110	EXT. THE BACKWATER - NIGHT 
THE FISHING BOAT that bought SARAH and her friends to the island sits still in the channel. There are SOLDIERS ABOARD, two of Rhodes' men, pacing the deck, passing a bottle back and forth. 
JOHN (o.s.) Well, we found yer boat, lady, but so did they. 
JOHN, SARAH AND TOBY are huddled behind green cover peering out at the boat. 
SARAH Looks like just two. We can take 'em when the time comes. 
JOHN We're only about a quarter-mile from Cave entrance number five. 
TOBY That entrance is closest to the labs and the Bee cages. 
JOHN Come on. Let's go. 
They move off stealthily. 
They enter the clearing with the spectacular PLANTS that Miguel discovered. Six feet tall, their red-gold blossoms like trumpets with their bells down, these are Daturas, nightshades indigenous to southern Florida and parts of the Caribbean. 
SALLY AND JACK, who we saw working on the nitro sticks, are chopping off the eighteen-inch blossom and stuffing them into LARGE LEAF BAGS. They're wearing HOSPITAL MASKS over their mouth and noses. JOHN moves in to help. TOBY AND SARAH follow but JOHN stops them. 
JOHN Just stand guard for now. Spell us after a while. Can't breathe this grass too long or somebody hafta carry you home. 
Work goes on in silence. 
111	EXT. THE STREET OUTSIDE THE RITZ - NIGHT 
DIESEL frees the doctor's shoulder from the hook. BLOOD FLOWS FREELY. DIESEL grabs a handful of DRESSINGS from LOGAN'S PACK and goes to work on the wound. 
LOGAN ...the pain of Hell...the pain...the pain... 
115	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE VENTS - NIGHT 
SARAH, SALLY, LUKEY AND McDERMOTT stand by while JOHN AND TOBY swing open THE RUSTED GRILLWORK OF AN AIR-VENT in the ground. TOBY is able to swing his upper torso completely down inside. 
116	INT. THE VENT - NIGHT 
TOBY hangs up-side-down in A RUSH OF AIR. He tightens A HOSPITAL MASK over his nose and mouth. 
TOBY Okay. Lemme have 'em. 
A LEAF BAG is passed in from above. TOBY flags the bag open and BITS OF FLOWER AND POLLEN DUST FLY through the tight space, sucked off into the duct. 
117	INT. THE COMMUNICATION ROOM - NIGHT 
CLOSE ON: A GRILL NEAR THE CEILING. BITS OF TOXIC POLLEN and AN OCCASIONAL PIECE OF FLOWER blow into the room. 
There are SIX TECHNICIANS AND TWO SECURITY GUARDS posted at various stations. A RADIO MAN looks up. 
RADIO MAN What's that? Smell it? 
TECHNICIAN Dunno. Must be comin' from outside. Kinda nice. 
118	INT. ENTRANCE NUMBER SEVEN - NIGHT 
There are only TWO GUARDS posted at the sealed entrance. One is eating from A CAN OF SPAM. The other is reading an old, dog-eared PLAYBOY. A RIFLE BARREL jabs suddenly into "Playboy's" back. 
JULIE Don't move! 
It's JULIE GRANT, Mary's disgruntled assistant. A YOUNG MAN, another behaviouralist in a WHITE LAB COAT is with her. They both have RIFLES. 
JULIE Open the outer door. Move it! 
"Playboy" slowly gets up and starts towards A CONTROL PANEL. At the last minute, he spins around, grabbing JULIE'S GUN BARREL and pushing it away. JULIE'S YOUNG ACCOMPLICE swings his RIFLE BUTT and knocks "Playboy" cold. Then he trains the weapon on "Spam man" again. 
JULIE moves to the controls, examines them, trips A TOGGLE marked "LOCK" and pushes A LARGE GREEN BUTTON. 
THE DOOR TO THE OUTSIDE SWINGS OPEN. Beyond is blackness with an occasional patch of MOONLIGHT ON JUNGLE GROWTH. JULIE walks slowly, carefully toward the opening. Just as she is about to cross the threshold into the night, A HUGE FIGURE leaps at her, grabbing her RIFLE and enclosing her in a strangle hold. It's DIESEL. Behind him, comes JACK, his RIFLE (Sarah's rifle) levelled off at JULIE'S YOUNG FRIEND. 
"Spam man" makes a break for it down the hall. Reacting nervously, too quickly, JACK FIRES. "SPAM MAN" IS HIT SQUARELY IN THE BACK. He pitches forward, dead. 
THE YOUNG SCIENTIST raises his gun. 
YOUNG MAN Hey! What the hell.....? 
JACK FIRES ANOTHER BURST and the ORANGE CIRCLE ON THE YOUNG MAN'S CHEST SHOW A DOTTED LINE OF RED. He flies back, a surprised expression on his face, and he flops, dead, right on top of the "Playboy" guard who is lying near the control booth. 
LOGAN ENOUGH! ENOUGH! ENOUGH! ENOUGH! 
THE DOC comes slowly out of the night guiding SPIDER over the threshold and into the hall. LOGAN reminds us of a crazy John Houston, floating on air in a madman's bubble. 
JULIE What...what is this? Who...? 
LOGAN It's alright, it's alright, my dear. You've simply helped us do the Lord's work. 
LOGAN'S SHOULDER WOUND IS BLEEDING THROUGH ITS DRESSINGS but the doctor, on a holy mission, seems to feel no pain. He guides SPIDER into the light and opens her shirt. DIESEL shoves JULIE against a wall. JACK covers her with his AUTOMATIC. 
LOGAN removes RED-SOAKED DRESSING from SPIDER'S skin. All over her bare chest and upper belly we see LONG, EIGHT-INCH SCARS, HASTILY STITCHED WITH SUTURE SHOWING. Beneath each is A CIGAR-SHAPED BULGE where a vial of nitro has been implanted. The woman stands on crumbling legs, her arms open outward, a grotesque lampoon of a stigmatic. 
JULIE What...what have you done to her? 
TOBY (filter) (on video) LET US IN. THERE'S BEEN A REVOLT...AT STALAG SEVENTEEN...THERE'S REBELS CRAWLIN' EVERYWHERE! 
GUARD #2 I know him. That's Tyler. 
TOBY (filter) (on video) FER CHRISSAKE! LEMME IN, DAMMIT! LEMME IN! 
THE FIRST GUARD HITS A BUTTON AND THE BIG STEEL ENTRANCE DOOR SWINGS OPEN. THE REBELS storm in like an ocean wave taking the hapless GUARDS completely by surprise. They knock them unconscious and take their WEAPONS. TOBY pushes A BUTTON which causes the outer door to swing shut, then he leads the band down the corridor. 
They go through A DOOR about a hundred yards from the entrance. 
123	INT. MAINTENANCE SHAFT - NIGHT 
This is one of the WORK CORRIDORS that TOBY mentioned earlier. THE REBELS run, single-file, deep into the Cave. 
124	INT. ENTRANCE SEVEN - NIGHT 
JULIE GRANT has been ROPE-TIED to an eyelet in the wall. DIESEL sets down A PISTOL AND A BOX OF AMMO beside DOC LOGAN who is sitting on the floor beside the control booth. He's having trouble catching his breath. His WOUND has turned his ENTIRE FRONT RED. 
DIESEL You'd hold us back. We have to go on. 
LOGAN Hmmmmmm? Oh, yes. Go on. 
SPIDER, her shirt buttoned again over her new dressings, is carefully signing something. DIESEL reads her fingers. 
DIESEL Maps. Yes. She was supposed to bring us maps. 
JACK steps over to JULIE. He frisks her pockets and finds TWO HAND- DRAWN MAPS showing complete layouts of the Cave. 
DIESEL Alright. Let's go. 
They move out, DIESEL supporting SPIDER, JACK with his RIFLE ready. 
125	INT. A SUPPLY CLOSET - NIGHT 
TOBY breaks open A CARTON and pulls GAS MASKS out. He passes them back to BILL McDERMOTT AND SARAH. 
126	INT. THE COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - NIGHT 
THE REBELS, all wearing GAS MASKS, burst into the room. TOBY moves right toward AN INTERCOM. He punches in a code and waits while the INTERCOM BUZZES. 
TOBY Come on, Mary. Answer. ANSWER! 
Nothing. Toby punches up another code while the others drag THE UNCONSCIOUS GUARD out of the doorway, letting the doors shut behind them. A VOICE comes over the speakers. 
TRICKS (o.s. - filter) Yeah. 
TOBY Tricks, it's Tyler. We're inside. 
TRICKS (o.s. - filter) What? Was that you that set off the alarms? 
TOBY No. There's some loonies from outside. They're gonna try to blow the powder magazine. 
TRICKS (o.s. - filter) Where are you? What's the plan? 
TOBY Find Mary. If you can get help do it. We're gonna hit the power station and haul-ass outa here. We'll be at exit five...that's exit five in exactly ten minutes. 
TRICKS (o.s. - filter) I think I can get a couple guys. 
TOBY And Mary! You gotta find Mary! 
TRICKS (o.s. - filter) I'll try, Tob. I'm gone. 
TRICKS clicks off. TOBY levels his AUTOMATIC at the RADIO CONSOLE and FIRES. SPARKS FLY, CHUNKS OF WOOD AND METAL SHOOT OFF IN EVERY DIRECTION. 
NURSE What should we do? 
MARY looks past THE NURSE into A ROOM where A GROUP OF CHILDREN, a dozen or so, ranging from twelve-years-old down to infancy, are huddled. Some are crying. 
MARY God. I, er...I dunno what to say. It could be a real evacuation or it could just be a glitch in the system. Wait here for now. I'll...I'll make sure you get the word what to do, okay? 
NURSE Please...hurry... 
MARY takes off down the hall. 
135	INT. ENTRANCE SEVEN - NIGHT 
CLOSE ON: JULIE GRANT'S FACE, screaming, in agony, on the brink of insanity. THE ZOMBIES have reached her. They're started to pull at her arms, her legs. ONE BITES HER HAND, ANOTHER HER ARM, ANOTHER HER CALF. 
DOC LOGAN is watching from the control booth, all the while fiddling with BUTTONS, DIALS, LEVERS. 
LOGAN We'll be in Heaven soon. We'll all be in Heaven soon. (Julie's screams penetrate the fog in his brain. He frowns.) Pain. God forgive the pain inflicted by surgeons. We must atone. We must atone for our sins. 
His eye is attracted to A LARGE LEVER seemingly separate from everything else. It's marked: SIREN. He pulls it. 
LOGAN We must...atone. We must. 
136	EXT. THE SIREN HORN - NIGHT 
Slowly, THE THROATY WAIL RISES and calls out over the jungle. It's the "Feeding Signal" we heard earlier. 
137	EXT. THE JUNGLE - NIGHT 
MONTAGE: as everywhere in the jungle ZOMBIES turn toward the call of THE SIREN. They start to walk...toward the SOUND, toward the place where there is food. 
138	INT. ENTRANCE SEVEN - NIGHT 
JULIE is still screaming wildly. THE ZOMBIES ARE TEARING HER APART, LITERALLY. 
DOC LOGAN inadvertently kicks THE PISTOL left by DIESEL and is skitters across the floor. He flops down on his knees. 
LOGAN WE WILL ATONE. WE WILL BE THE SACRIFICE...THE COMMUNION...WE OFFER OURSELVES UP...OUR SOUL...AND OUR BODIES... 
JULIE GRANT finally loses consciousness. MANY MORE ZOMBIES are pressing in through the entrance now. They reach LOGAN and start to tear at him. Something clicks in his brain and he realises what's happening. He starts to scream. His hands find THE PISTOL on the floor. 
ONE ZOMBIE TAKES A BITE OUT OF HIS LEFT ARM. He shrieks and brings up THE PISTOL, FIRING. THE FIRST SHOT RIPS OPEN THE CREATURE'S SKULL. The next FIVE SHOTS are wasted, FIRED WILDLY. The GUN CLICKS emptily as THE ZOMBIES engulf him, TEARING, BITING, EATING HIM ALIVE. 
MORE ZOMBIES come out of the jungle...a lot more...called by the SIREN. In waves they enter the Cave looking for food. 
139	INT. A CORRIDOR IN THE CAVE - NIGHT 
TRICKS is running through the hall with TWO BUDDIES. MARY HENRIED jumps out of the crowd. 
MARY Tricks! What's going on? 
TRICKS Toby's in the Cave. We're gonna make our move. There's rebels out to blow the powder magazine. Come on. Come with us. 
MARY Where are you goin' out? 
TRICKS Exit five. 
MARY See ya there. 
She turns away and starts back in the direction she came from. TRICKS calls after her. 
TRICKS SEVEN MINUTES, MARY. EXACTLY SEVEN MINUTES! 
140	INT. THE MAIN CHAMBER OF THE CAVE - NIGHT

SOLARIS 
by 
Steven Soderbergh 
October 4, 2001 
First, over BLACK, we hear the sound of a light rain. 
Then: 
A MAN'S VOICE I'm not a poet.  I've never moved anyone with my words. (beat) Maybe that's why they chose me. 
EXT.  WOODS - DAY 
A mural of leafless trees beneath an overcast sky.  Rain continues to fall. 
Maybe now we begin to notice a strange quality to the light (or is it the sky?).  Something vaguely unsettling. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  BEDROOM - MORNING 
Still, the sound of rain is heard. 
A MAN 
40s, lies on his side in bed, staring at us. 
He has not been sleeping.  In fact, judging from his distant expression, he has not slept in ages. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  ROAD - DAY 
Less like a road and more like a path that you maneuver a vehicle through. 
The Man, dressed in rain gear, walks down the middle.  He is accompanied by a medium-sized LABRADOR, and seems in no particular hurry. 
The sound of tires appear and grow in intensity.  The Man, without saying an actual word, instructs the dog to heal. The dog obeys as the Man moves off the road.  The vehicle hurtles past him -- its engine quiet, its windows darkened -- spraying muddy debris in its wake. 
Seconds later, the car brakes abruptly and skids to a stop. 
THE MAN 
Stops walking and stares at the car, which seems ominously still. 
The car then reverses direction and begins to move toward the Man, who remains motionless. 
When the car is alongside him, a darkened window turns transparent and we see a WELL-DRESSED BUREAUCRAT in the rear seat.  His demeanor is pleasant and professional. 
WELL-DRESSED BUREAUCRAT Dr. Kelvin? 
The Man he is addressing, who we now understand is CHRIS KELVIN, stares back at him. 
CUT TO: 
Kelvin gets his bearings and looks around, but sees no sign of life. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  CORRIDOR 
Empty. 
(NOTE: Except for some ROBOTIC, NON-SPEAKING CHARACTERS: the AUTOMATED TASKMASTERS.  These are small, bug-like repair units that constantly roam the ship, fixing things.  Their tiny hum is virtually silent, and we see them all the time on the Prometheus.  They can adhere to any surface at any angle.) 
Kelvin, now out of his space suit and holding a small carrying case and a duffle bag, moves on. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  GIBARIAN'S ROOM 
Ransacked. 
Kelvin registers it, then moves to the corner of the room where the computer terminal rests.  Within moments he has discovered Gibarian has recorded a video message for him to replay. 
VIDEO 
Gibarian addressing the camera.  He appears to be lucid, but extremely fatigued. 
GIBARIAN Hi, Chris. (a light smile) I'm so glad you came. (beat, the smile fades) I still have a little time, and I want to tell you something.  To warn you.  By now you know about me, or if you don't, get Snow or Sartorius to tell you; it doesn't matter. (beat) I didn't lose my mind.  You should be able to tell from this video. I'm not mad. (beat) If it happens to you, remember that it isn't madness. (beat) You should know, I'm in favor of destroying Solaris.  I know that's... illegal.  And unethical. And irresponsible.  But it's the only way to make it stop. 
A long moment of silence is broken by a noise on the video, which draws Gibarian's attention offscreen. 
GIBARIAN (addressing whoever made the noise) Cut that out.  Do you hear me? 
Gibarian switches off the video. 
The computer screen freezes the last recorded frame and overlays a readout indicating the file has ended. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  CORRIDOR 
Empty.  But there is a door at the end of it, slightly open. Kelvin moves toward it. 
INT.  ROOM 
A FIGURE, seated with its back to the door, turns to see Kelvin enter.  This is SNOW.  He looks Kelvin up and down, his expression wary and alert. 
KELVIN Snow.  Didn't you hear me radio? I'm Kelvin. 
A long beat.  Snow just watches him. 
SNOW Yes.  We heard. 
Kelvin takes a step forward, and Snow recoils. 
KELVIN What's wrong?  What happened to Gibarian? 
SNOW He's dead. 
KELVIN How? 
A beat. 
SARTORIUS In the lab.  With her, probably. 
KELVIN Her?  Who are you talking about? 
Sartorius is grabbed by something on the other side of his door.  He struggles to keep his composure. 
SARTORIUS His last wish was to be buried on Earth.  In dirt, he said.  "I want to buried in dirt."  What a clown. 
Sartorius is losing the battle with whomever or whatever is on the other side of his door. 
KELVIN They shouldn't let people like you into space. 
SARTORIUS Just so you know: I'm not going back until I understand what it is. I am going to figure out what it is, make it stop, and then I will go home. 
KELVIN Listen -- 
SARTORIUS We're done.  Oh, I should tell you, I don't trust Snow.  There's something wrong with him. 
Sartorius rotates and zips back into his room.  As the door closes Kelvin sees a flash of ANOTHER FIGURE in Sartorius' room.  The glimpse was too quick to judge who or what the other figure could have been. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  CORRIDOR - DAY 
Kelvin walks, exploring the ship.  He sees something that stops him: 
A NUDE WOMAN 
Black, early 20s, slipping across a corridor up ahead. 
Kelvin gives chase.  He sees her turn a corner, but by the time he gets there, she is gone. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  SNOW'S ROOM 
Snow is lying on his bunk. 
KELVIN Is there anybody else here? 
SNOW (sits up a little) Why, who did you see? 
KELVIN Gibarian warned me.  He left me a message. 
SNOW Who was it? 
KELVIN She was real.  Where did she come from? 
Snow looks at him but doesn't respond. 
KELVIN Tell me.  I won't think you're insane. 
SNOW Oh, that's a relief. 
Snow lies back down. 
KELVIN Where did she come from? 
A beat. 
INT.  TRAIN - DAY 
Continued silence, AND: 
RHEYA, 30s, staring at us, practically daring us to look away.  Her obvious intelligence and confidence make her extremely compelling, along with the fact that it was her parted lips we were looking at a moment ago.  Her expression indicates she's in a very raw emotional state. 
REVERSE ANGLE 
Kelvin is the person she has locked eyes with on the TRAIN. 
He is younger here; not just in age, but in spirit.  The contrast with his older self is striking. 
BACK TO KELVIN 
Asleep on the ship.  After a beat: 
EXTREME CLOSE-UP: 
Rheya's LIPS. 
Except the circumstance is clearly different: it's darker and there isn't the side-to-side shimmy of the train car. 
A WIDER VIEW 
Reveals that Rheya is not sitting on the train -- she is sitting in Kelvin's room on the Prometheus, right now. 
She is staring at Kelvin and she is ethereal in her stillness. 
KELVIN 
Awakens, blinks, and slowly recognizes her. 
If he is not entirely surprised it is because he has obviously dreamed of Rheya before.  He looks at her, simply. 
RHEYA 
Stands and makes her way to Kelvin. 
Without hesitation she kisses him and they begin to explore each other and we see all of it happen and two things are obvious: first, they have done this before, and two: they haven't done it in some time. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM 
Kelvin is asleep, Rheya in his arms. 
He wakes up and looks at her, perplexed.  After a beat he rises to sit on the edge of the bed. 
A wave of terror is barely suppressed as he puts his hand to his forehead.  Rheya opens her eyes. 
KELVIN Oh, God.  I'm awake. 
RHEYA Yes. 
He looks at her. 
KELVIN Where did you come from? 
She moves to him and kisses him as if that's all she wants to do, forever. 
RHEYA We're taking a flight? 
KELVIN Yes. 
He opens the door of a pod and indicates for her to enter. She is unsure. 
KELVIN Go ahead.  I'll close the door behind me. 
She stares up and into the pod.  Kelvin watches her go with difficulty and then CLOSES THE DOOR behind Rheya. 
He walks across the docking bay to the control room and begins preparations for the pod to be jettisoned. 
KELVIN 
In agony as he watches a real-time, beat-by-beat brand of technological murder take place: Rheya's pod is pushed off into space. 
RHEYA 
Her face contorted in confusion, watches through the pod window as the docking bay doors close in front of her with a brutal finality. 
KELVIN 
collapses to the ground, shattered. 
INSERT: 
A woman's HAND, resting on the floor of an apartment.  The fingers are being licked by a LABRADOR PUPPY. 
ANOTHER INSERT: 
A pot of coffee, on the boil.  Except that it has been left unattended for too long... 
ANOTHER INSERT: 
A rain-streaked window. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM 
Kelvin, on the edge of his bed.  He wants to tear himself inside out. 
A voice calls over the intercom: Snow's. 
SNOW Was her breakfast conversation that bad? 
KELVIN Shut up. 
SNOW I told you, try to stay calm. You're supposed to be the psychologist of the bunch. 
KELVIN What was it? 
Kelvin rises and goes to wash his face. 
SNOW Personally, I think it's God.  At least, it fits my definition. 
KELVIN And professionally? 
SNOW I'm not sure. (beat) It started with Gibarian.  He locked himself in his room and refused to talk except through a crack in the door.  He covered the video lens.  Obviously we thought he was having a nervous breakdown. I don't know why he didn't tell us he had somebody in there.  By this time, we were getting visitors, too.  He was desperately trying to figure it out.  Day and night. (beat) Who was she? 
INT.  APARTMENT - NIGHT 
The immediate aftermath of the preceding scene, but at home now. 
Rheya crying as she embraces Kelvin. 
RHEYA I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry. 
He is unmoved, but she labors to change his mind. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  APARTMENT - MORNING 
Rheya, in a chair, remorseful, Kelvin is dressing. 
KELVIN You're better when you take them. 
RHEYA I know, I know.  But still, somehow I don't feel better. 
KELVIN All right.  How about I feel better when you take them? 
A beat. 
RHEYA Right. 
They look at each other and understand; she will take the pills. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  APARTMENT - MORNING 
Rheya, on the floor, dead.  Her hand outstretched, a repeat of an image we saw earlier. 
Rain streaks the kitchen window. 
The bottle of pills nearby. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  PROMETHEUS 
Rheya is taking her pills.  Kelvin watches. 
KELVIN What do you remember? 
RHEYA What do you mean? 
KELVIN Do you remember Beethoven?  The Beatles?  Movies, books, restaurants, friends? 
RHEYA (thinking) Yes.  But not until you mentioned them.  As soon as you said those things, I remembered them.  And they have associations that make me think of other things I remember. It's like filling up. 
She looks out the portal at Solaris. 
RHEYA Is it a planet? 
KELVIN Not exactly.  It exists in a continuum that wasn't proven until ten years ago, a higher mathematical dimension superimposed on top of the Universe.  An infinite number of them, in fact. It was a violation of all of our various laws regarding the Universe, Space, or Space-Time.  It was completely counter-intuitive. We had to unlearn everything. 
RHEYA Is it intelligent? 
Finally, he steps forward and presses the button to open the door. 
RHEYA 
Is revealed, covered in blood.  She has completely torn the inside of the cabin door apart and has badly injured herself in the process. 
KELVIN Rheya... 
Confused, she looks up at him as he takes her in his arms and carries her to the bed. 
RHEYA What happened? 
KELVIN You were trying to break down the door.  Do you know why? 
RHEYA When I saw you were gone I got scared. 
He puts her down on the bed and runs to the bathroom, where he gathers all the first aid materials he can find. 
Returning, he blanches. 
Rheya's wounds have HEALED; in fact, they are HEALING in front of us. 
She looks up at him and doesn't like the look on his face. 
RHEYA Chris, what's wrong with me? 
CUT TO: 
INT.  LAB 
Kelvin runs Rheya through a battery of tests and studies the results. 
RHEYA Am I all right? 
A beat. 
KELVIN Yes. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  B DECK CONFERENCE ROOM 
Snow and Sartorius wait for Kelvin. 
SNOW He won't do it. 
SARTORIUS Why do you say that? 
SNOW He won't. 
Kelvin enters, with Rheya.  Snow and Sartorius exchange glances. 
KELVIN This is my wife, Rheya. 
She looks at Snow and nods.  Sartorius she hates instantly, and the feeling seems to be mutual. 
SARTORIUS We thought you'd be alone.  We want to talk about... 
SNOW We want to talk freely. 
She finishes making her drink, drinks it, and walks out the door. 
Kelvin stands in the doorway for a beat, then pivots and returns to bed.  The light goes out. 
RHEYA (V.O.) Yes, I remember that.  I went back to Lois' house and spent the night. Those were dark days. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  PARTY - NIGHT 
Kelvin and Rheya, later in the evening when they spoke for the first time.  They are absolutely infatuated with each other; they know something is happening between them, will happen between them. 
RHEYA I would have these -- I don't know how to describe them -- visions, when I was younger.  Maybe not visions, but like these waking dream states.  Time would just collapse, I would be inside time. I would stare at a second hand on a clock until it stopped.  Freaky stuff. 
KELVIN How old were you? 
RHEYA Seven, eight.  So one day my mother catches me sort of staring off into space, and she asks me what I'm doing, and I start trying to explain to her, about this state that I can put myself in, and this look comes over her face. 
KELVIN What kind of look? 
INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM 
Kelvin and Rheya sit together in the Prometheus.  Rheya continues her story without a beat. 
RHEYA Scared.  No, not scared.  Wary. Like I was something to be... her guard went up.  I was a threat. Now I know why.  She was afraid she'd be seen.  That I would see her for the self-obsessed neurotic that she was.  I think she thought she had a few more years of being on a pedestal.  But that's the cycle, right?  I knew a little more than she did, she knew a little more than her mother, and on and on. (beat) I guess that's part of the reason why -- 
KELVIN I know.  I know.  We don't have to talk about that. 
Another beat. 
RHEYA I remember days of just thinking about you. 
INT.  OFFICES - DAY 
Intercut Kelvin and Rheya at their respective jobs, going through a normal day.  There is no sound.  As we see these images, it's clear that Kelvin and Rheya are slightly not present in their respective encounters with other people; they are distracted by the idea of each other. 
And they like it. 
RHEYA Thinking what you were doing and saying, just being consumed by thinking of you.  I loved it so much, that feeling. 
KELVIN I did too. 
INT.  APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Rheya on the edge of the bed, facing away. 
KELVIN I used to watch you undress. 
As she does: 
KELVIN I never tired of watching you undress.  Every time, it was exciting.  Right until... to the end. 
A beat.  Then a shot of Kelvin that we've seen before: Him leaving their apartment, angry. 
ON THE PROMETHEUS 
A beat. 
RHEYA What happened to us, exactly? 
INT.  APARTMENT - DAY 
Kelvin holds the dead Rheya. 
KELVIN (ON PROMETHEUS) 
Squeezing her. 
KELVIN I should have believed you. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM 
Kelvin lies in bed, his eyes open.  Rheya is in his arms. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  APARTMENT - DAY 
Rheya, talking to Chris.  Obviously during a period when they were getting along.  Or at least: not fighting. 
RHEYA I can't help feeling that I'm cheating when I take them. 
KELVIN It's genetics.  You know this.  You know where it comes from.  There is nothing wrong with uncrossing a few crossed wires. 
She knows, intellectually, that he is right.  But it doesn't matter. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM 
Kelvin is out of bed and speaking into a videophone to Snow. Rheya is asleep in the background.  The room is dark except for the glow of the screen. 
SNOW You're unnerved because you've spent your whole life thinking nobody is looking over you, and suddenly your subconscious is an open book.  We are, for the first time, experiencing changes in natural reality by a force not our own.  That proves that -- 
KELVIN -- we are not sure of that.  We are not sure we aren't all hallucinating. 
SNOW If God is beyond our comprehension, and she -- (meaning Rheya) -- is here for reasons that can't be understood, isn't God here? 
KELVIN Not necessarily. 
SNOW Stop equivocating!  Unbelievable, how you equivocate!  You, the atheist, you're more dogmatic than any holy person I've ever seen! This is happening, Kevin.  Wake up. 
KELVIN Consciousness is enough, that's all I've saying.  Consciousness should be enough for anybody. 
SNOW Who are you trying to convince? 
Kelvin just looks back at Rheya. 
SNOW It will end badly.  As inevitably as the rising of a bubble. 
Kelvin doesn't respond. 
SNOW Let's all meet tomorrow.  Sartorius has some new ideas, about making it stop. 
Kelvin just keeps staring at Rheya, asleep. 
CUT TO: 
KELVIN It's a violent response to something we haven't figured out. Don't let the cowardly demeanor fool you: He is ruthless. Unblinking in his prejudice. 
RHEYA It was obvious from the way he first looked at me. 
A beat.  He holds her. 
RHEYA Do I really feel like... I am...? 
KELVIN Yes.  Yes. 
RHEYA I'm glad. 
A beat. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  SOLARIS 
Turning, slowly. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Then years ago.  Kelvin, naked, sitting in a chair, in the dark.  Rheya, also naked, is smoking a cigarette in bed. 
KELVIN Everything you pursue, you end up becoming disinterested in.  The fact that you're good at everything you try makes it worse.  You have a degree in animal science, you could be a terrific vet. You drifted into writing and turned out to be a perceptive journalist. Then it was politics, which seemed best of all, you had an actual gift for understanding the best pattern for a group of people to be arranged for you to achieve your goal.  And they didn't even know they were being arranged.  But you got bored with it, like you do with everything. 
She just smokes, not really looking at him.  Maybe it's a common observation and she's past being defensive about it. 
KELVIN I don't know what it's really like, to not know what you want to do. To not have anything that you love to do more than anything else. 
A beat.  He looks at her.  She seems more interested in her cigarette at the moment. 
RHEYA (sarcastic) Imagine my frustration. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM 
On the Prometheus.  Rheya is awake, Kelvin asleep. 
She rises and goes to sit in a chair; she is anxious, something we haven't seen before. 
Kelvin wakes up, looks at her.  Noting her expression: 
KELVIN What's wrong. 
RHEYA You don't love me. 
KELVIN Stop. 
A beat.  She looks down. 
RHEYA I have to talk to you... I... I don't know where I came from. (up at him) Do you know? 
He doesn't respond. 
RHEYA If you know but can't tell me now... will you ever be able to? 
Kelvin, Rheya, Sartorius, and Snow.  They are in the middle of a heated discussion. 
SNOW Gibarian was under enormous -- 
SARTORIUS Gibarian was helpless.  It's very simple: Man created the science that resulted in the discovery of Solaris, and the ship that brought us here. 
KELVIN Meaning Man can do whatever the fuck it wants? 
SARTORIUS Yes. 
KELVIN That's fantastic. 
SARTORIUS Why did you agree to come here? 
A beat. 
SARTORIUS Too tired to answer? 
Looks at Rheya, then back to Kelvin. 
SARTORIUS I'll bet.  Is this what they sent you here to do?  You've lost it, you've gone native. 
Kelvin moves toward him.  Sartorius just lets him come. 
RHEYA (to Sartorius) You're the coward. 
KELVIN Don't debate him; he'll say anything. 
RHEYA (still, to Sartorius) I'm just as human as you.  I see, I hear, I touch, and I feel just like you do. 
SARTORIUS Prove it. 
RHEYA These "guests" are a part of you, of your subconscious.  Chris loves me. 
SARTORIUS YOU ARE NOT HUMAN!  Try to understand that if you can understand anything! 
Kelvin is within an inch of his face. 
KELVIN Get out of here. 
Slowly, carefully, Sartorius grasps Kelvin by the shoulders. Then he leans in and whispers in Kelvin's ear: 
SARTORIUS Rheya is dead.  She's a copy.  A facsimile.  And she's seducing you all over again.  You're sick.  You think of fucking her as research for humanity.  It's just fucking. 
Kelvin backs away. 
SARTORIUS There's nothing grandiose about it. You've jumped out of a plane and you're trying to sew a parachute together while you fall. 
Sartorius turns... 
SARTORIUS It'd be hilarious if it weren't so damn sad. 
And leaves. 
A beat. 
SNOW We didn't even get to hear his new ideas. 
Snow wanders toward the door. 
RHEYA That's what you were saying.  I heard what you were saying. 
KELVIN For a reason that neither of us understand, you are forced to stay near me.  That's all I know right now. 
She realizes she doesn't want to argue.  Not right now, anyway. 
RHEYA I have these strange thoughts, I don't know where they come from. (beat) I can't explain it. 
KELVIN Neither can I.  Not any of it. There's no reference point for what's going on; it's never happened before.  It's a clean break in the fabric of the Universe; a gap.  There is nothing to do but experience it, moment-to- moment, and not let it destroy us. 
RHEYA But that's what happened before. 
KELVIN Not this time. 
He kisses her.  She wants to believe him, so she says nothing.  Then: 
RHEYA Do you want to stay here? 
KELVIN Do you? 
RHEYA If you're here. 
They kiss again... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM 
Kelvin is asleep.  Rheya is next to him. 
Offscreen, we hear the door open. 
Someone walks quietly (though not surreptitiously) through the frame and sits. 
After a long beat, Kelvin bolts upright, his mind struggling to clear.  When it does: 
KELVIN Gibarian. 
GIBARIAN Leave the light off. 
A beat.  Kelvin tries to get his bearings. 
GIBARIAN I wish you'd come a little sooner. I might not have had to kill myself. 
He smiles, looking at Kelvin. 
GIBARIAN You think you're dreaming me, like you dream her.  Understand something: I am the real Gibarian. Just a new incarnation. 
KELVIN What do you want? 
GIBARIAN You're being tricked.  Sartorius picked a fight with you to avoid telling you about his idea for getting rid of the visitors.  He's figured out they're made of subatomic particles called neutrinos, and he's going to create a negative neutrino field.  Twenty four hours a day, until they're back on Earth. 
KELVIN Can it work? 
GIBARIAN It can.  Ordinary matter, like ours?  Not affected.  Everything else, disintegrates. 
Kelvin registers this. 
GIBARIAN What I'm saying is: Don't trust anyone.  Find yourself a weapon of some sort. 
EXT.  SOLARIS 
Turning slowly. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM 
Kelvin and Rheya, in bed. 
RHEYA Do you think I can get pregnant here? 
A long beat. 
KELVIN We'll know soon enough. 
INSERT: 
The first time Kelvin and Rheya spoke, at the party ten years ago.  Again we see her whisper in Kelvin's ear, but this time we hear what she is saying: 
RHEYA I can't be a mother. 
She pulls back. 
KELVIN That's good to know. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  APARTMENT - DAY 
Kelvin, as he packs to leave Rheya. 
RHEYA Don't do this.  I am literally begging you not to do this.  Chris. 
KELVIN You should have told me. 
RHEYA It wouldn't have made any difference. 
KELVIN Thank you. 
RHEYA Chris, I had to.  I had to.  I didn't think you'd react like this. 
KELVIN Neither did I. 
RHEYA You never said you wanted one. 
KELVIN I never said I didn't. 
RHEYA Chris -- 
KELVIN I can't stay here. 
RHEYA Chris, please.  Chris, I'm serious. I won't make it. 
KELVIN Then you won't make it. 
He leaves, brushing past her. 
CUT TO: 
Rheya and Kelvin. 
RHEYA What do I have to do to stop it? 
KELVIN I want you here. 
RHEYA You're lying. 
KELVIN You exist here.  I keep telling you. 
RHEYA That's impossible.  I'm not Rheya. 
KELVIN Who are you, then? 
RHEYA I... I am Rheya.  But I am not the woman you loved ten years ago. 
KELVIN Yes, you are -- 
RHEYA Did you hear what Gibarian said? I'm not a human being.  I'm an instrument.  I came from your memory and your imagination and I will torture you no matter what. Even if I remain passive.  That's when I drank the... (beat) I was going mad.  It felt like there was no body underneath my skin.  There was something else. An illusion.  But I could feel my heart beating, and I remembered you tested my blood.  Is it like yours? 
KELVIN Yes.  I told you.  It was exactly like mine. 
RHEYA But then I would be dead now. 
A beat. 
KELVIN Is that really what you want? 
RHEYA I want to stop taking those pills. 
KELVIN I wish you wouldn't. 
RHEYA They do something to me.  It's hard to think straight. 
KELVIN I think they help. 
RHEYA I have consciousness, but I am not mortal.  Don't you see why I'm going crazy? 
KELVIN You have to remember that I love you, that's all that matters -- 
RHEYA I can't -- 
KELVIN It put you here.  I'll admit it, it acted like a God and put you here, put you into my consciousness. I was asleep, and it put you into my dream.  I saw your mouth.  And there you were. (beat) Whether you've been sent here to make me happy or punish me, it doesn't matter.  The decision we make now is all that matters.  Stay with me. 
RHEYA Am I really her? 
KELVIN I don't know anymore.  All I see is you. 
They kiss. 
KELVIN Stay with me. (beat) Stay with me. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM 
Kelvin is asleep.  Rheya is next to him. 
CUT TO: 
RHEYA What are you taking? 
KELVIN A sleeping pill.  Do you want yours? 
INT.  APARTMENT - DAY 
Rheya, on the kitchen floor.  The bottle of sleeping pills just beyond her hand. 
BACK ON THE PROMETHEUS 
Kelvin looks at Rheya.  She shakes her head; she doesn't want the pills.  Kelvin comes and sits beside her. 
KELVIN What does it want? 
RHEYA I don't know.  Something. Anything. 
She goes to a portal and stares out at Solaris. 
RHEYA It created me and yet I can't communicate with it.  It must hear me, though.  It must know what's happening to me.  Don't you think? 
CUT TO: 
INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM 
Snow on the videophone to Kelvin.  Rheya is asleep in the background. 
SNOW I don't think it dislikes us.  I think it just noticed us.  It lives, thinks, and acts.  We are dealing with a living creature here, no question.  And it's done something we've never been able to do: create a perfect human body. Perfect except for the subatomic alterations, but... 
CUT TO: 
GIBARIAN 
On his suicide tape: 
GIBARIAN If Solaris is inside our brain, and it knows everything, and we're only consciously aware of what 2% of our brain is up to at any given moment, it knows us better than we know ourselves.  It's not even close. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM 
Rheya and Kelvin. 
RHEYA I've decided that if it is God, it's a sick God.  Its ambitions exceed its powers, but it doesn't realize it. (beat) It's created a situation without a goal, and I hate that.  A God whose passion is not a redemption, who saves nothing, fulfills no purpose. (beat) And us?  We would have to have "an arrangement".  An unspoken understanding that I am not human. How can I not hate something that does that? 
KELVIN Please.  Don't. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM 
Kelvin is asleep.  Rheya is crying beside him. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM 
Kelvin asleep, alone.  Rheya is in the corridor, talking to someone. 
KELVIN 
EXT.  STREET CORNER - DAY 
Ten years ago.  Kelvin and Rheya standing on a street corner. They seem to be pausing in the midst of a very serious conversation.  It is raining. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM 
Kelvin in bed, on the Prometheus.  Still feverish. 
Rheya is mopping his brow. 
INT.  KELVIN'S CABIN (EARTH) 
Kelvin in bed, feverish. 
Rheya is there, wiping his forehead. 
INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM 
On the Prometheus.  Kelvin looks over to Rheya. 
KELVIN Where did you go before? 
RHEYA When? 
KELVIN Last night.  You were talking to someone in the corridor. 
RHEYA You must have been dreaming. 
She begins to cry. 
KELVIN What's the matter? 
She just shakes her head. 
KELVIN Rheya? 
From Kelvin's point of view: Rheya, in the chair, crying. 
Then he looks right to see: Rheya, in the doorway, talking to someone we cannot see. 
Then he looks further to the right, and there she is again, staring at him from the bathroom doorway.  She moves to the edge of the bed in order to be near. 
KELVIN 
Sweating.  Struggling.  Beyond fear. 
KELVIN (V.O.) I'm losing my mind. (beat) I'm breaking apart. 
INT.  CABIN - DAY 
Kelvin sits in his chair, as he did at the beginning, with the three officials from DBA behind him. 
Only now the three officials are Snow, Sartorius, and Gibarian. 
INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM (PROMETHEUS) 
Kelvin, transfixed. 
SNOW I won't be making the trip. 
SARTORIUS Snow, get up here, now. 
SNOW I'm not Snow. 
This stops Kelvin and Sartorius.  They look at each other and then at the monitor. 
SNOW I got rid of him.  I wanted to see if... I wanted to be the only one. I wanted to be Snow. 
SARTORIUS Fuck me.  I knew it. 
KELVIN When did this happen? 
SNOW Oh, right away.  That's why you never saw me with anyone.  You should've noticed that.  I miss him, though.  I think I made a mistake. 
KELVIN Jesus... 
SNOW But I can't leave with you.  I won't make it. 
KELVIN Maybe you can. 
SARTORIUS You want it coming back with us? 
SNOW You go ahead.  Of what I remember about Earth... it's all one thing now.  Everything's a blur.  I like distinctions. 
Snow lies down on his bed.  Kelvin looks at Sartorius. 
SARTORIUS We do not have time to deal with this.  Get the diode sail into position and let me know when the bias drive and the induction ring are at zero point. 
Kelvin nods and obeys.  He then takes one last look at the monitor to see Snow lying in bed.  Kelvin reaches over and shuts the monitor off. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  SPACE 
Silence. 
The Prometheus moves away from Solaris. 
CLOSER ON SOLARIS 
After the ship has gone. 
A soft black spot begins to form in the center of the planet. 
Slowly, inexorably, this black spot begins to expand. 
Within a minute Solaris has disappeared. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  STREET CORNER - DAY 
Kelvin, back on Earth.  Silent and still.  And the rain continues. 
He watches the activity; the cars, buses, and people moving to and fro. 
KELVIN (V.O.) Earth. (beat) What did that word mean to me? (beat) I have returned.  Finally.

FADE IN: 
BEGINNING LOGO The familiar logo WARNER BROS. PRESENTS COMES UP. After a beat, it is consumed by FIRE. It becomes AN AMERICAN FLAG, BURNING in the street. 
1 EXT. U.S. EMBASSY (TEHRAN) - MORNING 1 
Effigies of Jimmy Carter and the deposed Shah -- crowds chanting Magbar Carter! Magbar Ahmrika! Fists in the air. 
SUPERIMPOSE: TEHRAN - NOVEMBER 4, 1979 YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN -- about 2/3 men and 1/3 women, some with flak jackets; about half the young women wear full chador. Many wear plastic bibs with photographs of Ayatollah Khomeini. PASTED TO ROOSEVELT GATE: photographs of STUDENTS who were killed under the deposed Shah of Iran's regime. Signs in English: U.S.A. RETURN THE SHAH -- JUSTICE FOR MURDER. A few IRANIAN POLICE attend -- more as bystanders than peacekeepers. A MAN frantically stabs an EFFIGY of the SHAH. An IRANIAN STUDENT films the scene with a Super 8 camera. 
2 EXT. EMBASSY GROUNDS - MORNING 2 
From INSIDE THE EMBASSY GATES we can hear the noise of the protest. There are three primary buildings on campus: the CHANCERY, the embassy's main building, THE AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE, and the CONSULATE. We can see that the compound is securitized: sand-filled traps and steel bars on the windows of the consulate. 
3 INT. U.S. EMBASSY - CONSULATE OFFICE - MORNING 3 
Now, we see the POV THROUGH those steel bars. Standing on a chair looking at the protest outside the gate, is BOB ANDERS, late 40s-50s, a consular officer.

BOB ANDERS Carnival's bigger today. MARK LIJEK, 29, a consular officer, joins Anders at the window. 
4 EXT. ROOSEVELT GATE - MORNING 4 
Then, in a famous piece of archive footage, something simple happens. A YOUNG MAN IN A SWEATER climbs the gate and makes it to the other side. And now, we see the REVERSE of that famous shot. This isn't archive footage anymore. We're looking at the POV of TOM AHERN, 48, the CIA station chief here. 
5 INT. MARINE GUARD POST - MORNING 5 
From a pillbox on the embassy campus, SGT. ROCKY SICKMANN, a young MARINE, can also see the protestors break across the lawn. 
MARINE SGT. SICKMANN (into his radio) ... Fort Apache is breached -- please advise -- 
6 EXT. ROOSEVELT GATE - MORNING 6 
The PROTEST in front of the gate is getting rowdier -- its energy and numbers swelling. A group of STUDENTS -- these more brisk, organized, all bearded and dressed in flak jackets -- push their way to the front of the protest -- WOMEN raise a banner. It's a signal. As if on cue, the IRANIAN POLICE move from the gates. A WOMAN removes a large pair of bolt cutters from underneath her chador -- hands them to a BEARDED STUDENT -- who gets to work on the CHAINS holding the gate 
CLOSED -- When one YOUNG MAN wearing a green military field jacket raises his fist, we can see that he has a concealed PISTOL in his clothes. More STUDENTS climbing the wall -- dropping the 12 feet to the other side, one after another.

9 INT. CHANCERY OFFICE - MORNING 9 
Mounting chaos in here, the nerve center of the embassy. Everyone on a different phone. It's like an emergency room where the patient is the whole building. ANN SWIFT, 31, Deputy Political Officer, has the phone by her ear -- trying to hear reports from D.C. 
ANN SWIFT There are hundreds of people out 
THERE -- 
(LOOKS OUT) No, thousands... There are 
THOUSANDS -- 
10 IN THE CONSULATE OFFICE - MORNING 10 Mark Lijek and Bob Anders look out windows, nervous, but not like the Iranian VISA APPLICANTS who are close to panic.

NICHOLLS Ferrying out the torture apparatus of our friend's fallen dictatorship. Both these men do this work and share an unspoken understanding. They stop and look up at a MOSAIC on the wall. An ancient rendition of Christ, fashioned before the Muslims took the city and converted this church to a mosque. Nicholls has WHITE AND YELLOW SLIPS OF PAPER with Farsi writing on them in hand.

Nicholls takes a picture.

Chinese-made Swiss watches, banks, mosques, butchers, fabric stores, gold stands. Boys with hand-trucks loaded down with piles of fabric cut through the crowd. Older Islamic architecture elbows up against neon signs and rickety wooden stands with second-story balconies like Bourbon Street. Bob Anders walks toward the front. 
REZA You are the director?

REZA

PILOT (V.O.) 
(GERMAN-ACCENTED 
ENGLISH) Ladies and gentlemen, from the flight-deck. We're looking at a brief delay -- Passengers groan a bit as they read paperbacks or International Herald Tribunes. Mark Lijek's arm is around Cora. Lee Schatz is moving his mouth in what looks like a prayer. Kathy Stafford's fingers shake as she holds an arm rest. J Stafford tries to stay her hand. Mendez is sitting looking out the window toward the terminal. 
300 INT. MEHRABAD AIRPORT - FLIGHT GATE - MORNING 300

Azizi gs to the WINDOW. He can see the Swissair plane slowly backing onto the runway. He picks up a walkie and pushes through the flight gate door, setting off an alarm, followed by the three other Komiteh. He reaches the METAL BARS outside and can't get past. He CALLS INTO THE WALKIE.

LAMONT Is that right, Jack?

330 EXT. BY LESTER'S POOL - DAY 330 
Siegel in a bathrobe, looking out over L.A., holding The New York Times in front of him: SIX U.S. DIPLOMATS, HIDDEN BY CANADA, LEAVE IRAN SAFELY. Next to that, an article about Ken Taylor: DIPLOMAT DIRECTED ESCAPE IN IRAN. (Front page, NYT 1/30/80.)

333 INT. CIA ARCHIVES - DAY 333 
And suddenly it's dead-quiet. We're in a vault inside a vault in the basement of the main building. Mendez's suitcase is laying on a low counter, an ARCHIVES OFFICER t-tagging and cataloging various items. Separating Mendez's personal things from material related to the operation. Mendez empties his briefcase and the officer puts a sticker on the VARIETY featuring the ARGO ad. Another on the ARGO script. He's putting things into a box that reads: USCIA CLASSIFIED MATERIAL. Mendez opens his accordion folder -- flips through it -- it's empty -- no. There's something inside. In one of the compartments is a STORYBOARD FROM ARGO. One that the Komiteh missed. While the Archives Officer is turned around, Mendez slips the storyboard back into the accordion folder and puts it back with his personal things. 
ARGO - Final 119. 
334 EXT. CIA - FRONT PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON 334 
O'Donnell is on his way out, heading toward Tony who is heading in. Seeing Mendez, he stops dead. 
O'DONNELL And I left my autograph book at home. His Eminence called me. He wants to see you. 
MENDEZ He wants to fire me himself. 
O'DONNELL He wants to give you the Intelligence Star. You're getting the highest award of merit of the Clandestine Services of these United States. Ceremony's two weeks from today. Mendez stops walking. A beat. 
MENDEZ If they push it a week, I can bring Ian. That's his winter break. 
O'DONNELL The op was classified so the ceremony's classified. He can't know about it. Nobody can know about it. 
MENDEZ They're gonna hand me an award, then they're gonna take it back? 
O'DONNELL If we wanted applause, we would have joined the circus. 
MENDEZ I thought we did. O'Donnell claps Tony on the shoulder. Tony walks towards the entrance and Jack heads to his car.

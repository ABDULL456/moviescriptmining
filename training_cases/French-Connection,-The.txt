EXT. A BAR IN BED-STUY - DAY 
A large man in a Santa Claus suit and white beard is entertaining a group of black children.  He leads them in the singing of a Christmas Carol (Hark the Herald Angels Sing).  The man is DETECTIVE FIRST GRADE JIMMY DOYLE.  His attention is split between the children and the activity inside the bar. 
INT. THE BAR - DOYLE'S POV - DAY 
The place is crowded with mid-day drinkers.  Dimly outlined at the far end of the bar are TWO BLACK MEN involved in some kind of transaction in which a package is exchanged for money.  As the transaction seems to be completed, cut to 
EXT. THE BAR - DAY 
BLACK PUSHER Man, I'm clean. 
DOYLE You made three sales to your roaches back there.  We had to chase you through all this shit and you tell me you're clean? 
RUSSO Who stuck up the laundromat? 
DOYLE How about that time you were picking your feet in Poughkeepsie? 
The BLACK PUSHER'S eyes go to RUSSO in panic, looking for relief from the pressure of the inquisition. 
RUSSO (in pain) You better give me the guy who got the old Jew or you better give me something or you're just a memory in this town. 
BLACK PUSHER That's a lot o' shit.  I didn't do nothin'. 
The BLACK PUSHER's eyes are on DOYLE, frozen in confusion and fear. 
DOYLE You put a shiv in my partner.  Know what that means?  All winter I gotta listen to him gripe about his bowling scores.  Now I'm gonna bust your ass for those three bags - then I'm gonna nail you for pickin' your feet in Poughkeepsie. 
EXT. HEADQUARTERS NARCOTICS BUREAU OF THE NYPD 12 OLD SLIP AND SOUTH STREETS - NIGHT 
DOYLE and RUSSO standing side by side on the front steps of the old First Precinct on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. RUSSO has his overcoat over his shoulders as a cape.  The sleeve of his left arm is rolled up over a blood-stained bandage on the left forearm. 
DOYLE Havin' trouble?  You're a dumb guinea. 
RUSSO How'd I know he had a knife. 
DOYLE Never trust a nigger. 
RUSSO He coulda been white. 
DOYLE Never trust anybody.  You goin' sick? 
RUSSO Not a chance. 
RUSSO nods in acceptance of the remark.  The easy, synical rapport between them is obvious: they are partners in a business where somebody is always getting hurt and pain is part of the inventory. 
DOYLE Let's popeye around the Chez for a half hour, catch the end of the show and a couple drinks. 
RUSSO Some other time Jimmy, I'm beat. 
DOYLE reaches into the right side pocket of BUDDY's suitcoat for a cigarette and matches.  He lights up two in the pause, sticks one in RUSSO's mouth. 
DOYLE Come on -- one drink.  Whatta you say? 
RUSSO Drink this. 
DOYLE Whip it out. 
INT. THE CLUB - NIGHT 
THE TITLES COMMENCE 
THE FRENCH CONNECTION 
Titles over a close shot of a chorus line, with lots of tits and ass and lean, long legs in a brassy blare of music.  We zoom back to the area where DOYLE and RUSSO are beginning to occupy a table.  RUSSO takes the seat on the right, eyes immediately on all that ginch, while DOYLE standing, gives their order.  We do not hear the dialogue but DOYLE asks RUSSO what he wants BUDDY looks up and says "Cinzano." DOYLE turns and says "Two of these." DOYLE slips into the chair opposite RUSSO and the titles roll on.  Unlike RUSSO who is concentrating on the girls, DOYLE is digging the room and the people who occupy the tables in it, as if he is the sort of man who cannot relax until he knows who is around him, why they are there. 
INT. THE CLUB - NIGHT 
A long view from DOYLE's position of the room, a quick certain survey that stumbles twice; on laughter that seems too raw and then over a flurry of activity by WAITERS and CAPTAINS serving a table on the main floor.  DOYLE's attention is apprehended by the noise and activity that emanate from the same large table. 
DOYLE I make at least two junk connections at that table in the corner.  The guy is the stripe combo, I know him too. 
RUSSO Hey, I thought we come for a drink. 
INT. THE CLUB - NIGHT 
A long view of the table with DOYLE and RUSSO very close foreground, left and right.  DOYLE is leaning on an elbow.

CHARNIER Pour moi? 
MARIE Regarde, il te va parfaitement bien! 
CHARNIER Formidable!  Sans toi je m'habillerais encore en docker. (then, taking off coat) Je suis passé voir Françoise. 
MARIE Comment va-t-elle?

DOYLE and RUSSO in parked car.

RUSSO Suspicion of what? 
DOYLE Makin' wine in the basement. (pause) He looks like that wop stooge used to drive for the Fracisi brothers.

RUSSO Lay off with that wop stuff, will you? 
EXT. WEINSTOCK'S APT. BUILDING - DAY 
In the East 80's.  SAL exits. 
DOYLE That's the third time he come here this week.  You got anything on the building? 
DOYLE and RUSSO in parked car. 
INT. BAR ROOM - DAY 
The Young Man is thrown in, followed by DOYLE and RUSSO. There are about 20 or 30 PUETRO RICAN and BLACK MEN in the joint, a couple of BLACK WOMEN.  They are in all manner of dress.  Half of them are wearing shades.  The bar is noisy with conversation, laughter and music. 
DOYLE and RUSSO standing in the doorway, DOYLE slightly to the left, RUSSO a little behind him.  DOYLE's arms are at his sides.  RUSSO's right hand is crossed over his belt, under his jacket and on the butt of his .38, ready, waiting to back his partner's play or respond to any move within the bar. 
DOYLE moving into the bar alone.  He pulls the plug out of the Juke Box, plunging the room to silence. 
DOYLE Hands on your heads.  Popeye's here! 
Twenty men raise hands to their heads as one.  The raggle- taggle swarm plays a kind of human chicken, refusing to move until the last moment then stepping out of his way.  One of the customers doesn't. 
DOYLE What's my name? 
1ST MAN Doyle. 
DOYLE What? 
1ST MAN Mr. Doyle. 
DOYLE Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie? 
1ST MAN What? 
DOYLE raises his left arm and pushes the MAN aside.  The MAN's eyes go to RUSSO, off-camera at the door, and back to DOYLE.  He doesn't resist; he gets in line with the rest of them, a line formed about four or five feet from the bar, running the length of it. 
Close of DOYLE at the bar, holding an ashcan and skimming the metal underrailing with one finger, knocking off the magnetized key boxes into the ashcan.  He isn't even looking at them.  His eyes are across the bar, staring down the customers. 
Close shot of the ashcan and the little metal boxes clinking into it. 
Close shot of DOYLE, the ashcan now on the bar, opening one of the boxes, taking out the ten dollar bill, putting it on the bar. 
Then, opening another, taking out the glassine deck of heroin.  Then another, containing a glassine deck.  He empties the glassine envelopes on the bar into a cocktail mixer which he proceeds to shake.  The shaker is half-filled with tomato juice. 
DOYLE leaning over the bar toward the glaring crowd, pours the mixture into the ashcan. 
DOYLE Milk shake anyone? 
He wiggles his finger.  It is a command for THREE MEN to step forward.  The MEN do not move at first. 
DOYLE Move ass when I tell you. 
They move, shuffling, hesitatingly.  But they move -- TWO BLACKS and A PUETRO RICAN. 
DOYLE Put it on the bar. 
Hands of the THREE MEN going into pockets. 
Close of a miscellany of keys, coins, cigarettes going onto the bar -- with two hypodermics, six or eight marijuana cigarettes, a small plastic vial of barbiturates. 
DOYLE (collecting the works) All right, you three clowns step into those phone booths, you're goin' in.  Go on.  Stand in there till I'm ready for you. 
The three men turn and enter the individual phone booths. They stand, waiting, like contestants in the $64 Question. 
DOYLE Everybody goes when the whistle blows. 
RUSSO is with another man from whom he's just taken a set of works. 
RUSSO What's your story? 
DANCER Gimme a break, Mr. Russo.  I'm in show business. 
RUSSO You're in show business. 
DANCER S'right. 
DOYLE What do you do in show business? 
DANCER I'm a dancer. 
2ND MAN Boca? 
DOYLE B.O.C.A. 
2ND MAN Doesn't register. 
DOYLE Got a wife named Angie. 
2ND MAN No, nothing.  There's only some talk. 
DOYLE What? 
2ND MAN Coming in this week, week after. Everybody going to get well. 
DOYLE Who brings it? 
2ND MAN Who knows? 
DOYLE Where do you want it? 
2ND MAN This side. 
Door of toilet.  There is a hell of a crash and slamming behind it.  Door opens and DOYLE steps out over the crumpled prostrate form of the INFORMER.  He has just decked the man to continue the protection of the cover.  He pauses halfway down the line as if he's speculating on beating up another one because he didn't get any information.  But he decides that would be futile too. 
DOYLE I'm goin' check on this address in the Bronx, if you're bullshitting me, it's your ass. 
RUSSO Tell everybody we'll be back in an hour. 
DOYLE (to all) We're goin' now!  Goodbye. 
EXT. PASSENGER SHIP - DAY 
Close shot of DEVEREAUX, New York harbor in the background, being interviewed by television reporters on his arrival in the U.S. abroad a passenger ship.  He is smiling, jovial, charming. 
REPORTER 1 How long will you be here? 
DEVEREAUX Not long enough.  Two... perhaps three... weeks at most. 
Medium close shot of DEVEREAUX and THREE TV REPORTERS, as they talk, a crane moves into action behind them and lifts out of hold.  LA VALLE is with DEVEREAUX as Translator and Interpreter. 
GIRL TV REPORTER Why did you come by ship, Mr. Devereaux? 
DEVEREAUX The next several weeks will be very difficult and the middle of the ocean is the only place where the telephone isn't ringing all the time. 
REPORTER What will be the viewpoint of your documentary. 
DEVEREAUX To make a Frenchman feel what it is like to be a New Yorker. 
LA VALLE That's enough now, ladies and gentlemen.  M. Devereaux is due at his hotel in half an hour. 
Overhead the Lincoln comes down from the hold of the ship. 
EXT. WEST SIDE DRIVE - DAY 
A long view of the pier from the opposite (east) side of West Street, beneath the steel trusses and girders of the West Side Drive and through the forest of cars that are parked there, the jam of traffic that develops around every unloading vessel.  It is a view that takes in the front end of the Lincoln inching off the pier.  HENRI DEVEREAUX at the wheel, turns to his right.  We watch until the point of view on the sidewalk.  ALAIN CHARNIER and PIERRE NICOLI are standing there watching.  When the car (off-camera) turns east on the way to the garage, NICOLI glances to CHARNIER. CHARNIER does not look back. 
EXT. DORAL HOTEL - LINCOLN PULLS IN - DAY 
INT. POLICE OFFICE - NIGHT 
Close shot of WALTER SIMONSON at desk in the large square office he occupies as a Lieutenant of Detectives in charge of the Manhattan Narcotics Bureau.  He is the immediate superior of RUSSO and DOYLE, head of the 200-man narcotics squad that polices Manhattan. 
SIMONSON (with coffee cup) All that is great -- but you guys work Bed-Stuy.  You're not supposed to be in Ridgewood. 
DOYLE, RUSSO and SIMONSON 
DOYLE Detach us.  Let us have a shot at it, at least until we see if there's anything here or not. Everybody wants Weinstock, right? So maybe here's a lead.  We deserve it. 
SIMONSON You couldn't burn a three-time loser with what you're bringing in here.  You know you stiffs could run yourselves an entrapment rap. The guy has done nothing -- Brooklyn is full of Candy Store guys with two cars who like to go to nightclubs. 
SAL (V.O.) Well, if you can't do better than that, you can stick the cups. 
EXT. AUTO GRAVEYARD (HUNTS POINT AND EAST RIVER) - DAY 
HIGH ANGLE: Close shot of CHARNIER, MARIE and LA VALLE walking slowly together toward the camera.  They are at the auto graveyard and the scene of an auction of cars towed off New York streets by the Police Department.  About twenty other men are walking around, looking at the cars. 
A POLICEMAN blows a whistle and the prospective car buyers gather around the auction trailer in the b.g. 
LA VALLE There are four auto graveyards like this one in the other boroughs, handling about a thousand vehicles a month.  Those that aren't claimed are auctioned here once a month. 
MARIE Just for mistakes of parking? 
LA VALLE No.  Many are involved in crimes and confiscated... or just abandoned. This is, as you know, your prime source of scrap metal, M. Charnier. 
MARIE (off camera) Darling, may I have this one? 
Medium close shot MARIE, standing next to an LTD. 
MARIE It looks so lonesome here. 
CHARNIER and LA VALLE approach her. 
CHARNIER It would look even more lonesome in our garage. 
INT. THE AUCTION TRAILER - DAY 
Within the large trailer, about TWENTY MEN are seated at two long benches to each side.  Some are standing to the rear. At the front, an AUCTIONEER stands at a lectern.  To his left sits a CLERK at a small table.  The AUCTIONEER wears a sweater and hat.  The buyers are tough types, young and old. All have inventory lists.  The atmosphere is informal.  The CHARNIERS and LA VALLE enter the trailer at the back. 
AUCTIONEER Every car sold today must be removed at the purchaser's own expense.  We have no keys or anything to start the vehicles with. You buy 'em as you see 'em and where you see 'em.  All right, the first car offered is Number 24398. A Plymouth sedan.  Do I hear fifteen dollars? 
The bidding goes up to forty dollars.  A large BURLY MAN wins the bid.  He goes up to the CLERK and accepts the bill of sale. 
AUCTIONEER We go to 24399 -- A Pontiac Station wagon.  Do I hear ten dollars? 
LA VALLE (aside to CHARNIER) Notice he will never mention the year of the car. 
AUCTIONEER I got a fifteen dollar bid going... Do I hear anymore... Eighteen... who'll say Eighteen? Twenty... Twenty-three... Anymore... Twenty-five.  Twenty-five once -- Do I hear twenty-eight... All right, last call for twenty- five... 
Close shot of CHARNIER 
CHARNIER (aside of LA VALLE) And these are the cars we're buying for shipment? 
Close shot of CHARNIER, MARIE and LA VALLE.  They are facing the AUCTIONEER. 
LA VALLE Yes, sir.  That man in the dark jacket is our buyer. 
Close shot of THE BUYER, LOU BOCA.  He is very active and wins the present bid.

ANGIE (V.O.) Takin' care o' business -- it's after midnight.

RUSSO enters with a bag of sandwiches and cigarettes.  DOYLE waves him to the phone. 
SAL (V.O.)                     RUSSO ... Oh... yes... yeah...       Who is it? hello... this is Sal... How are ya?                                 DOYLE Sounds like a foreigner... CHARNIER (V.O.) Very well... you meet me                RUSSO Wednesday at the hotel...          (listening at the Okay?                              other phone) French... It's a Frenchman... SAL (V.O.)

SAL (V.O.) What time? 
CHARNIER (V.O.) Twelve o'clock... yes... 
SAL (V.O.) Yes -- 
The phone clicks off. 
DOYLE and RUSSO round each other and jump up and down like two kids. 
INT. WHIP GIRL'S APT. 
Close shot of NICOLI's face.  He's being whipped, and is caught in an ecstasy of pain and pleasure.  The tempo of the strokes rises.  Suddenly it reaches a crescendo and he screams out in orgasm. 
Close, full-length shot of a nude BLONDE GIRL, wearing only black boots and silk panties.  She's walking away from the camera, throwing aside a small cat-o-nine-tails flagellant whip.  We can hear NICOLI's heavy breathing until the girl speaks as she moves toward a couch. 
Medium close shot of NICOLI, tying his tie shrugging into overcoat. 
Medium close shot of NICOLI, looking at the bills with a pause to sort out the currency differences, then taking out five twenties. 
Close shot of the WHIP GIRL taking the five then moving up to the look of annoyance and disappointment on her face. 
WHIP GIRL You're Fifty Dollars short. 
The look of anger turns to one of consternation as NICOLI reacts to her. 
WHIP GIRL M'sieru - the tab for this scene is a hundred and a half. (he moves to door) Hey Frenchie - if you don't come up with the scratch, you're gonna run into my man downstairs. 
Medium close shot of NICOLI advancing on the WHIP GIRL as she backs away and begins to cringe.  He grabs her and hurls her back across the couch.

DEVEREAUX This is the new American religion, professional football.  It is where everybody goes instead of church on Sunday to express that peculiar American taste for bloodshed and violence. 
Several close shots of the violent action. 
Intercut with faces of the crowd. 
Close shot of DEVEREAUX. 
DEVEREAUX These men, playing a "game" - make more money each year than many important business leaders, artists or government officials. (zoom out) It tells us something about this country and how its men live, or go to war with a smile, and sometimes die without a cause. 
The phone rings - it is CHARNIER. 
EDITOR It's for you - Alain Charnier. 
Hold close up of DEVEREAUX. 
DOYLE You want some eggs. 
MUTCHIE Why not? 
DOYLE (looking around for bacon) Hey, Mutch!  You want bacon? 
MUTCHIE Yeah! 
DOYLE (rattling pans, looking around) Where the hell is it? 
MUTCHIE Where the hell do you think it is, potato head? 
DOYLE opens the door to the icebox. 
MUTCHIE No wonder there's so many Mafia around.  Ya couldn't find a Puerto Rican in Spanish Harlem. 
TIME LAPSE.  Almost morning.  Close on DOYLE and MUTCHIE eating bacon and eggs.  MUTCHIE is standing behind the bar as he eats, DOYLE is sitting in front of it.  They both have a bottle of beer. 
MUTCHIE I got this little chick I'm tryin' to hit on.  She's about 20, 21... I take her to Jilly's last night and she's tellin' me about how she wants to settle down one day, get married... I says, "Hey, this is 1971, baby, I'm just a dirty old man lookin' to score with some pussy." 
DOYLE Strike out, eh? 
MUTCHIE Yeah.  In the late innings.  Ya look like a night's sleep wouldn't kill ya. 
DOYLE A piece of ass wouldn't kill me. 
MUTCHIE When ya go back on? 
DOYLE Morning.  Sometime. 
MUTCHIE Whyn't ya stretch out on the pool table for a couple hours.  The kid comes in at six will wake ya.  A couple eggs and a beer is cheaper than keepin' a dog around the joint. 
EXT. MUTCHIE'S BAR - DAY 
Close of DOYLE going to his car.  He stops for a light. DOYLE is red-eyed and in need of a shave.  He fidgets through his pockets looking for a cigarette but doesn't find one.  As he drives along a GIRL CYCLIST comes into view alongside. 
Our view is DOYLE's view of her long, lean tapered legs.  If he looks further, and DOYLE always looks further, he will see there is a bra-band sweater covering her well-formed breasts.  The pendulous swing is there as she bends over the handlebars. 
Close front view of DOYLE looking back to the light, then back to the legs. 
Close outside view, the cyclist, of DOYLE leaning out the window with his badge in his hand. 
DOYLE You got a pedaller's license?

Medium close of SIMONSON and RUSSO 
SIMONSON Three. 
Close shot of MULDERIG. 
MULDERIG Christ, by the time you get out all this shit'll be legal. 
Wide shot of room, taking in SIMONSON, RUSSO, MULDERIG and PHIL KLEIN.  SIMONSON hands BUDDY a stack of warrants. 
SIMONSON (rises, to RUSSO) The judge gave you ten days on these.  Klein and Mulderig will be sitting in for the Federals.  Tell Doyle they'll make all the buys, and that they're to be kept informed of everything that goes down. 
SIMONSON turns to MULDERIG. 
A distant view from the Northeast corner of 46th Street and Madison Avenue of the Roosevelt Hotel marquee and the three men under it, CHARNIER, NICOLI and SAL.  They are in animated conversation. 
DOYLE and MULDERIG on the point-of-view corner across Madison, MULDERIG with his back to the camera, DOYLE talking and watching over Mulderig's shoulder. 
Close shot DOYLE's face, eyes bright with excitement. 
Long view of CHARNIER, NICOLI and SAL under the marquee from DOYLE's view, zooming in on CHARNIER, who continues to talk, look up, then look back to SAL.

CHARNIER and NICOLI window-shopping at Walter's Electric, 49th and 3rd Avenue. 
RUSSO looking quizzically, puzzled, from a doorway. 
CHARNIER and NICOLI are engaged in a running conversation that we cannot hear.  But what CHARNIER is saying is simply that he wants to get a pack of cigarettes before they turn back and stop for dinner. 
RUSSO looking to DOYLE for a signal. 
EXT. A CIGAR STORE - DAY 
DOYLE already beginning to feel the cold, rubbing his hands together, at the front of the place CHARNIER and NICOLI have entered, trying to figure it out as CHARNIER and NICOLI emerge, CHARNIER ripping the cellophane off a pack of cigarettes, and they turn back in DOYLE's direction. 
DOYLE, face to face with CHARNIER and NICOLI.  Straining to hear, he picks up a few words of French.  Without losing stride he steps off the curb and cuts across the street, moving south, away from them, as they come north.  But halfway across the street, we pick up RUSSO coming in his direction, sharp enough to pick up the tail where DOYLE had to drop it.

WEINSTOCK 
WEINSTOCK He could go someplace else with his sixty kilos of heroin and see how easy it is to pull together a half million cash.  He wouldn't find there was any hurry to do this kind of business. 
SAL, a little desperate.

CHARNIER (manner outwardly pleasant) You must take me for an imbecile. Why do you think I asked you to meet me in Washington?  I haven't spent five minutes in New York City without the company of a gendarme. 
SAL Look, I'll level with you -- I need a little more time -- I got to shift gears. 
CHARNIER Are you having trouble raising the half million?

LA VALLE The car was lost sometime this evening.  First they send us to Pier One -- then they send us here -- 
DESK SERGEANT I don't understand why you had it parked on the waterfront.  You're staying at the Doral and you lose your car somewhere out by the Brooklyn Bridge. 
LA VALLE In point of fact, M. Devereaux is scouting locations for a film for French Television.  He left the car to look at some point of interest. 
DEVEREAUX (moving, excitable) We were told by the Police Commissioner's office that the car was brought to this garage.  I demand its immediate return. 
DESK SERGEANT If you'll be patient, Mr. Devereaux. 
DEVEREAUX (moving) I have been patient enough.  There is no reason I should have to waste time with this red tape. 
LA VALLE Mr. Devereaux is an extremely important guest of this country. He is working with the absolute cooperation and participation of your government.  Here are his credentials from the French Consulate. (showing them) Unless you wish to see this episode portrayed in his film I suggest you locate his car immediately. 
CHARNIER Calm down -- Henri!  You must trust me -- this is an extremely complicated situation to which there is a simple solution if you do exactly what I tell you.  It's worth more money to you.

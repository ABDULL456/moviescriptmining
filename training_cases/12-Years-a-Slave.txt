FADE IN: 
1 INT. TOWNHOUSE/STUDY - DAY 1 
-EARLY APRIL, 1841- We are close on a PAIR OF BLACK HANDS as they open A 
FINELY WRAPPED PACKET OF VIOLIN STRINGS. 
WE CUT TO the hands stringing a VIOLIN. It's not a high end piece, but it is quite nice. 
WE CUT TO a wide shot of the study. Sitting in a chair with violin in hand is SOLOMON NORTHUP; a man in his late twenties. Everything about Solomon, his mien and manner, is distinguished. But he, too, seems a hardy individual. Someone who has known manual labor in his time. 
Solomon begins to lightly play his violin, as if testing the strings, their tuning. Satisfied, Solomon begins to play vigorously. As he does, we make a HARD CUT TO: 
INT. HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - EVENING 
We come in on a lively affair. A dinner party is being thrown within the confines of a fairly stately house. In attendance are EIGHT COUPLES. All are WHITE and all are FAIRLY YOUNG, in their early twenties. The men and women are dressed in very fine attire. We should get the sense that for the most part they are people of means. 
The furniture has been set aside in the living room. At the moment the couples are engaged in the dancing of a REEL. 
The music they are dancing to is being played by Solomon, having cut directly from the tune he was previously playing. He plays with a light determination, and in no way seems possessed with empty servitude. 
Solomon concludes the reel, and the dancers break into enthusiastic applause, which is followed by personal thanks and congratulations from all. It should be clear that despite their respective races there is much admiration and appreciation for Solomon's abilities. 
INT. NORTHUP HOUSE/BEDROOM - MORNING 
It is a Saturday morning. Clad in her finest attire is ANNE; Solomon's wife, a few years younger than he. We see also the Northup children: MARGARET who is eight, and ALONZO who is five. They are handsome, and well groomed kids. Anne straightens up the children. She finishes, 
(CONTINUED) 
3 CONTINUED: 3 she rises up and stands behind them, almost as if preparing to pose for a portrait. They all wait a moment, then Solomon enters the foyer. He stands and looks admiringly at his family. ADMIRINGLY stressed. It isn't that he doesn't have love for them, he does as well. But in the moment, he truly admires his greatest accomplishment: a family that is healthy and well and provided for. He goes to his children, and hands each a coin, then goes to Anne. Gives her a kiss on the cheek. The children giggle at the sight. 
EXT. STREET - DAY 
Solomon and his family are out walking along the streets and groves of Saratoga. 
The streets are well populated this morning with many people out strolling. Most are WHITE, but there are BLACKS as well. They are FREED BLACKS who mingle fairly easily - though not always completely - with the whites. We see, too, a few BLACK SLAVES who travel with their WHITE MASTERS. These pairings are largely from the south and - despite the fact the blacks are slaves - they are not physically downtrodden, not field hands. They are well dressed and "leading apparently an easy life" - comparatively speaking - as they trail their masters. 
As they walk, Solomon and his family arrive to an intersection well-worn and muddied from horse and cart traffic. Solomon and his children easily jump across the muck. Anne stands at the lip of the puddle, calls for Solomon to help her across. 
ANNE Solomon... Solomon, turning back to his wife with a broad smile waving her forward: 
SOLOMON Come, Anne. Jump. 
The children, now smiling as well, egg their mother on. 
ALONZO MARGARET Jump. You can make it. I've done it. You can make it. 
ANNE I will not ruin my dress. Catch me! 
Solomon moves close, holds out his arms. Yet, there's still just a bit of mischievousness in his eyes. Anne gives her husband a lightly stern look to which Solomon replies. 
(CONTINUED) 
SOLOMON I will catch you, Anne. 
(BEAT) I will. Again, lightly stern: 
ANNE You will. 
And with that Anne takes the leap. Solomon catches her, swings her around grandly and sets her down lightly to the delighted applause of the children. That done, Solomon takes Anne's hand and leads her on. 
As Solomon and his family make their way, among the slaves on the street, we see one in particular; JASPER. As he trails his MASTER he can't help but note Solomon and his family as they enter A STORE. His intrigue of this most handsome and harmonious group should be obvious. 
With his Master occupied, Jasper moves slyly toward the STORE. Frozen on the spot, Jasper looks on admiringly. Suddenly a voice barks out- 
A VOICE (O.S.) Jasper! Come on!

SOLOMON (CONT'D) people raised to fill the highest place of trust within their gift. William Henry Harrison." A long moment of quiet, the family continuing to eat. Then, from Margaret: 
MARGARET Will you read it again? 
ANNE Not just now, darling. Anne enters the dining room and places a large chicken at the center of the table. As she takes a seat, all heads are bowed. 
MARGARET For food that stays our hunger, For rest that brings us ease, For homes where memories linger, We give our thanks for these. 
ALL Amen. 
SOLOMON Margaret, that was wonderful. 
MARGARET Thank you, Papa. 
SOLOMON Alonzo, do you have something to say? 
ALONZO Yes, I helped Momma make this. 
ANNE Yes, and you were such a good help. Especially making the gravy. 
MARGARET Papa, I would very much like to learn how to play the violin. Could you teach me? 
ALONZO Me too! 
MARGARET Yes, but I asked Papa first. 
SOLOMON Both of you, calm down. We will have our first lesson after this wonderful dinner. And on that note, let's start eating. 
(CONTINUED) 
5B. 
6 CONTINUED: (2) 6 The family all tuck in to their meal. The scene is one of warmth and happiness. 
7 INT. NORTHUP HOUSE - NIGHT 7 
Solomon and Anne have fun and difficulty putting the unruly children to bed. They are tucked in, and each given a kiss good night. As Margaret lays down to sleep, Anne blows out the candle darkening the room. Silhouetted in the doorway, Solomon takes Anne in his arms, holds her tightly as they both luxuriate in the simple, beautiful gift that is their children. 
7A 7A 
INT. NORTHUP HOUSE - NIGHT 
Now alone together, we see Anne and Solomon wrapped in each other's arms. Beyond being physically close, emotionally close, they are just so very comfortable with one another. They are the very representation of a couple who are made for each other. 
They look at each other for a prolonged time. 
SOLOMON 
(COMICALLY FORLORN) Three weeks. Two days. 
ANNE It is the custom. I wonder what you'll do without me? 
SOLOMON I won't stay idle. SOLOMON's eyes lower. 
ANNE Darling, it's good money. 
SOLOMON If only I didn't have to share your cooking with other people. ANNE holds his gaze. 
ANNE You don't. They kiss. 
8 OMIT 8 
9 EXT. NORTHUP HOUSE - MORNING 9 
We are just outside the Northup house. A CARRIAGE waits with a DRIVER. Anne and the children are dressed for travel - Anne sporting HER NEW CARRY ALL. The Driver loads bags into the carriage. For her parting gift, Anne gives her husband a kiss. 
SOLOMON Travel safely. 
ANNE Stay safely. Anne and the children loaded up, the Driver chides the horse and the carriage heads off. Solomon waves a hearty good bye to his wife and children. 
13 INT. NORTHUP HOUSE/STUDY - LATER 13 
Solomon sits down to write a letter; pen poised over paper with already a few lines written. But Solomon thinks better of it. WITH LITTLE THOUGHT HE TEARS THE 
PAPER AND SETS IT ASIDE. WE SHOULD GET THE SENSE THAT 
THE ABSOLUTE VALUE OF BEING ABLE TO COMMUNICATE BY LETTER 
IS LOST ON SOLOMON. THIS FACT WILL HAVE GREAT WEIGHT IN 
THE NEAR FUTURE. 
EXT. SOLOMON'S HOUSE/INT. COVERED CARRIAGE - LATER 
Solomon enters the buggy, carpet bag in hand. Brown and Hamilton are waiting. They ride in a covered carriage led by a pair of "noble" horses. 
HAMILTON No letter to post? 
SOLOMON No need. My return will coincide with my family's. 
BROWN We're off then. 
INT. PUB - EVENING 
-MID TO LATE APRIL, 1841- We find ourselves in a roadside pub. It serves the purpose of drinking and diversion, and little more. As Solomon plays his violin, Brown and Hamilton perform a decent, paired magic routine before a SPARSE AUDIENCE NOT 
OF "SELECT CHARACTER." 
16 INT. PUB - LATER 16 
After the show, the pub now fairly empty, Solomon, Hamilton and Brown sit down to eat. Hamilton and Brown drink, but again Solomon abstains. Though Solomon remains cool, Hamilton and Brown put up a great show of being disappointed as Hamilton counts out what little money was collected. 
HAMILTON Not an additional tip from a one of them. They expect to be entertained for nothing. 
BROWN And not satisfied a bit despite giving them more than what they paid for. 
SOLOMON It's the national mood. There's too much grief to make room for frivolity. 
HAMILTON My sincerest apologies, Solomon. You were promised opportunity, and you were given none. 
BROWN The opportunity is with the circus. A two man show poorly promoted, what were we to expect? But the circus bills itself. 
HAMILTON True. 
BROWN I have told you of the circus with which we are connected. Creatures from the darkest of Africa. Acrobats from the Orient who-- 
SOLOMON You have described it, yes. 
BROWN Yes. We need to return immediately to Washington. Solomon...I believe us familiar enough now, but forgive me if I am bold...would you consider making the trip with us? Solomon gives a bit of a laugh at the idea. 
(CONTINUED) 
16 CONTINUED: 16 
HAMILTON Entertaining at pubs and inns has it's place, but a man of your skills deserves better. 
BROWN Hear, hear. 
HAMILTON And more importantly you would build your own name and following. The circus tends to attract those with the highest of reputations. An introduction here and there could amount to a lifetime of reward. Now would be the time. With your family away, an opportunity presents itself. 
BROWN Said as fellow artists as well as businessmen. Well worth the effort at least. 
SOLOMON You present a flattering representation. As my family will be traveling back shortly, perhaps I might commit only to one trial engagement. 
HAMILTON Oh, very good, sir. Very good. I cannot recall being so excited. 
BROWN There is a practical concern. If you are to continue on with us you should obtain your free papers. 
SOLOMON Not necessary. 
BROWN Here in New York, no. But we will be entering slave states and as a matter of precaution... It's to all our benefit we should not have to come to account for your well being. 
HAMILTON Six shillings worth of effort could well save much trouble later. 
(CONTINUED) 
SITUATION-- 
CLEMENS Who in your estimation is that sympathetic ear? 
SOLOMON The two men I journeyed with. I'm certain they're making inquires at this very moment. 
CLEMENS I would be just as certain they are counting the money paid for delivering you to this place. 
SOLOMON They were not kidnappers. They were artists. Fellow performers. 
CLEMENS You know that? You know for certain who they were? 
(CONTINUED) 
32 CONTINUED: (2) 32 The fact is, Solomon can't say for certain. 
CLEMENS (CONT'D) How I reckon the situation: whatever past we had...well, that's done now. The reality to come is us being transported southward. New Orleans if I were to venture. After we arrive, we'll be put to market. Beyond that... Well, once in a slave state I suppose there's only one outcome. 
JOHN No. 
CLEMENS I don't say that to give you empty agitation, John... 
JOHN For y'all. For y'all they ain't nothin' but that! But John was'n kidnapped. John bein' hold as debt, tha's all. Massa pay his debt, and John be redeemed-- 
CLEMENS Boy, our masters will not come for us. John is nearly beside himself with panic. 
JOHN Now John's...John's sorry for y'all, but tha's how it be. Where y'all goin', yah goin' witout John. Massa take care of me. Massa take care. 
RANDALL Mama! All three men turn and look. At the moment Randall doesn't call out emptily. At the door to the yard is Burch along with two women. One in her late twenties; ELIZA. She is "arrayed in silk, with rings upon her fingers, and golden ornaments suspended from her ears." Though a slave, Eliza was a mistress and has - to this point - lived well. This is reflected in her airs and her speech. The other is a little girl, light in skin color, of about seven or eight. This is EMILY, Randall's half sister. As she enters the yard Eliza squeals with high delight, then breaks into tears of both sorrow and joy. Clearly this is mother and child being reunited. 
(CONTINUED) 
32 CONTINUED: (3) 32 As Burch locks the yard door, Eliza clutches Randall. She is overcome with emotion. 
ELIZA My darling. My sweet, sweet baby. 
INT. BURCH'S DUNGEON - EVENING 
Later in the evening. Solomon now shares his space with Eliza and her children. As the children rest, Eliza drops into a lament as if pleading her case to Solomon who lends a sympathetic ear. 
Both slyly, and with a bit of aggrandizement: 
ELIZA When I say I had my master's favor, you understand. Above even his own wife, I had it. Do you know that he built a house for me? Built it on the sole condition that I reside there with him. The added promise in time I would be emancipated. And for nine years he blessed me with every comfort and luxury in life. Displaying the finery she still wears: 
ELIZA (CONT'D) Silks and jewels and even servants to wait upon us. Such was our life, and the life of this beautiful girl I bore for him. But Master Berry's daughter...she always looked at me with an unkind nature. She hated Emily no matter she and Emily were flesh of flesh. As Master Berry's health failed, she gained power in the household. Eventually, I was brought to the city on the false pretense of our free papers being executed. If I had known what waited; to be sent south? I swear I would not have come here alive. 
(CONTINUED) 
33 CONTINUED: 33 Eliza turns to her children: 
ELIZA (CONT'D) My poor, poor babies. 
34 INT. BURCH'S DUNGEON - NIGHT 34 
It's the deep of night, all are sleeping. A KEY TURNS IN THE LOCK AND THE DOOR OPENS. Burch enters with Radburn beside him. Both carry LANTERNS with them. Hardly giving Solomon and Eliza a moment to rouse themselves, 
BURCH DEMANDS: 
BURCH Come on. Get yer blankets. Get up. Sensing that things will not end well: 
ELIZA No, please don't... 
BURCH I don't want to hear yer talk. Get in the yard. 
ELIZA Please... 
RADBURN Ain't no need for all that. Putting hand to Randall's head. 
RADBURN (CONT'D) Jus takin' a li'l trip, tha's all. Don't want to frighten the chil'ren none over a li'l boat ride, do yah? Eliza gives a shake of her head to the negative. 
RADBURN (CONT'D) Alright then. Git yerselves up. 
EXT. BURCH'S DUNGEON/YARD - NIGHT 
We now have Solomon, Clemens, John, Eliza and the children. They are being cuffed together. As John is cuffed, he pulls back. Scared. He beings in 
FORD You will accept a note? 
FREEMAN As always, from you, Mr. Ford. Eliza is beside herself as it seems she is about to be separated from her family. She begs of Ford: 
(CONTINUED) 
59 CONTINUED: 59 
ELIZA Please, sir... Please don't divide my family. Don't take me unless you take my children as well. 
FREEMAN Eliza, quiet! 
ELIZA You will have the most faithful slave in me, sir. The most faithful slave that has ever lived, but I beg that you do not separate us. A BUYER interrupts the skirmish and approaches Freeman and delivers coolly, eyeing Randall- 
BUYER Your price for the child? 
FREEMAN You see how fit the boy is. Like ripe fruit. He will grow into a fine beast. Randall is made to run, and jump by FREEMAN - exhibiting his activity and his condition. 
FREEMAN (CONT'D) Six hundred, and that's fair and final. 
BUYER Done. He reaches into his waistcoat and retrieves his wallet, counting out six hundred dollars, placing them into the already extended hand of Freeman. Ford sees the distress and panic in Eliza; it visibly touches him. He now tries to buy EMILY to console her. 
FORD How much for the little girl? You have no need for her. One so young will bring you no profit. 
FREEMAN I will not sell the girl. There's heaps 'n piles of money to be made off her. She is a beauty. One of the regular bloods. None of your thick-lipped, bullet headed, cotton picking niggers. 
(CONTINUED) 
39A. 
59 CONTINUED: (2) 59 
FORD Her child, man. For God's sake, are you not sentimental in the least? 
FREEMAN My sentimentality stretches the length of a coin. Do you want the lot, Mr. Ford, or do you pass on them all? 
FORD I will take the ones Platt and Eliza. Eliza grips her children tight. 
ELIZA I will not go without my children. You will not take them from me. 
(CONTINUED) 
59 CONTINUED: (3) 59 As if to prove her wrong, Freeman puts a foot to Eliza and harshly kicks her away from Emily. 
ELIZA (CONT'D) Please, don't. No! Freeman, to Cape: 
FREEMAN Take her out of here. Cape DROPS HIS FIDDLE, begins to pull Eliza away toward the door of the room, but her screaming and pleading do not abate. IT IS CLEARLY UNSETTLING TO THE OTHER BUYERS. 
FREEMAN (CONT'D) Keep her quiet. Cape tries to muzzle her with his hand, but Eliza continues to scream for her children as Emily does for her mother. 
EMILY Mama... Mama! 
FREEMAN 
(TO SOLOMON) Play something! Get the fiddle and play. As ordered, Solomon takes up Cape's fiddle and begins to play lightly. 
FREEMAN (CONT'D) Play! Solomon plays harder and more loudly. Still, it is barely enough to drown out Eliza's cries. Freeman gets the other slaves to clap along with Solomon's playing. Emily frees herself and runs back, crying but endeavoring to be strong- 
EMILY Don't cry, Mama. I will be a good girl. Don't cry. I will keep my head up and I will look smart. I will always look smart. 
FREEMAN Make merry, all of you! Goddamn it, Cape! Keep her quiet or it's your damned hide I will take it out of! Cape pulls a rag, stuffs it in Eliza's mouth. Clamping both hands over her mouth, he hauls Eliza from the room by the head. IT IS AN UGLY, UGLY SCENE. 
40A. 
60 EXT. FORD PLANTATION - LATER 60 
Driven in a horse drawn wagon by Ford are Solomon and Eliza. Eliza is sullen to say the least. With the loss of her two children she has dropped into a depression she will not be able to pull out of. 
(CONTINUED) 
60 CONTINUED: 60 They arrive to the FORD PLANTATION. The main house of the plantation - the GREAT HOUSE as they are commonly called - is sizable. Two stories high with a piazza in front. In the rear are also a log kitchen, poultry house, corncribs and several slave cabins. The plantation is described as "a green spot in the wilderness." With the arrival of Master Ford there is a flurry of activity - the "excitement" of a new delivery. MR. CHAPIN, a white overseer, instructs a slave named SAM. 
CHAPIN Sam, call to the Mistress. 
SAM Mistress! Mistress, they arrivn'. MISTRESS FORD EXITS the house - along with her attending slave, RACHEL, who is a cook AS WELL AS SAM'S WIFE - and travels to her husband, kisses him, then laughingly 
65 CONTINUED: 65 the lawn just beyond the piazza. Mistress Ford is present as well. As the slaves listen, Ford reads to them Scripture. His tone is of a man trying to preach by way of compassion. 
FORD "But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. God is not the God of the dead, but of the living. And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his doctrine. Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying, Master, which is the great commandment in the law? Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets." Despite the lightness with which Ford speaks and the hope in his words, ELIZA SITS OFF TO THE SIDE - SELF-SECLUDED 
A BIT - WEEPING GENTLY. We should be able to see in Mistress Ford's eyes that Eliza's constant crying is unsettling.

70 EXT. FORD'S WORK AREA - DAY 70 
-MID JUNE, 1841- The slaves have broken for lunch. They snack on smoked meat and drink water from gourds. As they lunch Solomon reads from Sam's Bible to the other slaves. 
SOLOMON But he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve. For whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth? Is not he that sitteth at meat? But I am among you as he that serveth. A white customer - WINSLOW - irate at the sight and sound of slaves reading Scripture, crosses over. He grabs the Bible. 
WINSLOW From where did you thieve this? 
SAM Suh, the book is my property. The White Customer has no interest in Sam's answer. With flailing hands he STARTS BEATING ON SAM. Solomon tries to stop him. That only makes the situation worse, Solomon now the target of the man's ire. 
WINSLOW Take your hands from me! Ford comes running over. 
FORD What is the commotion? 
WINSLOW Your niggers are either brazen or rebellious. This one was readin' Scripture, and this one claims it to be his. 
FORD It is. A gift from his Mistress. 
WINSLOW You condone this? 
FORD I encourage it. As a Christian I can do no less. 
(CONTINUED) 
70 CONTINUED: 70 
WINSLOW You can do no worse, Ford. A slave that reads is dangerous. Winslow moves off. He yells back at Ford: 
WINSLOW (CONT'D) And the man who would allow a slave to read is unfit to own niggers! Handing the Bible back to Sam, very matter of factly: 
FORD Pay him no mind. The word of God applies to all. In that you may take comfort. 
OMITTED 
72 EXT. ROAD - DAY 72 
Sam is at the reigns of the wagon carrying the timber to Ford's WORK AREA. Slaves trudge alongside, same as it ever was. Only...it's not quite the same. Sam brings the wagon to a halt. He, and the slaves look up the road ahead of them. Standing in the middle of the road is a group of CHICKASAWS INDIANS. They are in their "usual" dress of buckskin breeches and calico hunting shirts of fantastic colors, buttoned from belt to chin. They have with them DOGS and HORSES. They carry with them the carcass of a deer. The two groups stare at each other for a long moment. 
EXT. FIELD - DUSK/END OF DAY 
The groups of slaves and Chickasaws are now intermingled. They "break bread" - actually they work on the carcass of the deer which is now roasting over a large fire. As well the group share a smoke on a pipe. One of the Chickasaws is playing a tune on an "INDIAN FIDDLE." The Chickasaws perform a customary dance; trotting after each other, and giving utterance to a guttural, sing-song noise. The slaves enjoy the respite from work, Solomon particularly taken by the music...if not entirely enthralled by it. 
(CONTINUED) 
73 CONTINUED: 73 After a bit, Solomon rights himself and heads from the group. 
74 EXT. RIVER BANK - CONTINUOUS 74 
Solomon arrives to some tall grass at the edge of the river. Lowering his trousers, SOLOMON SQUATS TO DEFECATE. As he does, he stares out toward the flowing waters of Indian Creek. After a few moments, as though a thought far greater than relieving himself has come to him, Solomon stands and replaces his pants. Oddly, Solomon stares out at the water as though he were a man possessed. 
EXT. FORD'S WORK AREA - DAY 
Just beyond the WORK AREA Solomon speaks with Ford as Tibeats listens. Solomon is drawing in the dirt, making rough diagrams for Ford as he explains himself. 
SOLOMON The creek is plenty deep enough to sail, even with a boat full of load. The distance from the WORK AREA to the point on the latter bayou is several miles by water fewer than land. It occurs to me that the expense of the transportation would be materially 
DIMINISHED-- 
TIBEATS "Materially diminished?" 
SOLOMON If we use the waterway. 
ELIZA You luxuriate in his favor. 
SOLOMON I survive. I will not fall into despair. Woeful and crushed; melancholy is the yolk I see most. I will offer up my talents to Master Ford. I will keep myself hearty until freedom is opportune. 
ELIZA Ford is your opportunity. Do you think he does not know that you are more than you suggest? But he does nothing for you. Nothing. You are no better than prized livestock. Call for him. Call, tell him of your previous circumstances and see what it earns you...Solomon. Eliza uses Solomon's name quite pointedly as if to underscore his true self. Solomon get her meaning. Yet he says nothing. Again, pointedly: 
ELIZA (CONT'D) So, you've settled into your role as Platt, then? 
SOLOMON 
(DEFENSIVE) My back is thick with scars from

(CONTINUED) 
79 CONTINUED: (2) 79 
SOLOMON (CONT'D) protesting my freedom. Do not 
ACCUSE ME-- 
ELIZA I accuse you of nothing. I cannot accuse. I too have done so many, many dishonorable things to survive. And for all of them I have ended up here... No better than if I had stood up for myself. Father, Lord and Savior forgive me... Forgive me. Oh, Solomon, let me weep for my children. 
FORD (V.O.) At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven? 
EXT. FORD PLANTATION - MORNING 
-AUGUST, 1841- It's Sunday. The slaves are again gathered in the rose garden near the front of the house to hear the word of the Lord as read by Master Ford. 
FORD And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them, And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. The phrase seems to trigger Eliza's tears. She begins to sob uncontrollably. Mrs. Ford turns to Rachel in a hushed whisper- 
MRS. FORD I cannot have that kind of depression about. Solomon, pretending not to have heard, slowly turns to Eliza with worry. Ford continues to preach over Eliza's keening. 
FORD But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea. Woe unto

FORD (CONT'D) the world because of offences! For it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh! 
BLACK 
81 EXT. FORD PLANTATION - DAY 81 
-JANUARY, 1842- Seasons have passed. It is winter now, and very grey out along the bayou. Ford and Tibeats - who we have seen working around the WORK AREA - stand with Solomon, Tibeats giving Solomon an inspection. Ford carries much lament. 
TIBEATS Raise yer shirt. Solomon does as instructed. Tibeats looks at Solomon's back, at the scars from lashings he bears. 
TIBEATS (CONT'D) Troublesome. 
FORD He's a good carpenter and quick- witted. 
TIBEATS I am familiar with his cleverness. 
FORD You won't find a nigger more humble. 
TIBEATS Ain't found a nigger yet I cain't humble. Tibeats heads off. Solomon, highly curious over the preceding. 
SOLOMON Sir, have I done something wrong? 
FORD Not your concern, Platt. I say with much...shame I have compiled debts. I have long preached austerity, but find myself hypocritical in that regard. You'll be in the ownership of Mr. Tibeats. You are his now. Serve him as you'd serve me. 
SOLOMON Sir. 
FORD And your faithfulness will not be forgotten. 
(CONTINUED) 
81 CONTINUED: 81 
SOLOMON: 
SOLOMON Master Tibeats wants to whip me for using the nails you gave me. 
CHAPIN What's the matter with the nails? With a mix of shame, anger and embarrassment, Tibeats says, as if being exposed- 
TIBEATS They're...they're too large. 
CHAPIN I am overseer here. I told Platt to use them, and 
(MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
84 CONTINUED: (3) 84 
CHAPIN (CONT'D) I shall furnish such nails as I please. Do you understand that, Mr. Tibeats? Tibeats answer is in the grinding of his teeth and the shaking of his fist. 
TIBEATS This ain't done by half. I will have flesh, and I will have all of it. Tibeats moves off toward, and then INTO THE HOUSE. Chapin follows. A long moment, Solomon stands alone. He looks around, not sure what to do; to stay or to flee. Anxiety mounts on his features. A moment more, and Tibeats EXITS the house. He saddles his horse and rides off to beat the devil. Or, worse, to fetch him. Chapin comes running back out of the house. He is visibly excited, and when he speaks he is quite earnest. Though he tries to project reasoned emotions he gives off an air of impending trouble. 
CHAPIN Do not stir. Do not attempt to leave the plantation on any account whatever. But if you run there is no protecting you. 
SOLOMON 
SIR-- 
CHAPIN If you run, Platt, there is no protecting you. Rachel...! Chapin runs off to join Rachel. The two converse at a distance from Solomon, then they head off for the log kitchen. Solomon is now very much alone, and he waits for what is to come. AND WE WAIT WITH HIM. And we wait, and we continue to wait... Moment by moment, the dread of the unexpected mounts. Solomon's eyes begin to well. He has beaten a white man, and he knows that death awaits him. 
A SLIGHT PRAYER TO THE HEAVENS BEGINS TO FORM IN HIS THROAT, but he is too choked up to fully speak it. 
(CONTINUED) 
84 CONTINUED: (4) 84 Chapin has now returned to the piazza. He stands and watches, but does not move to Solomon. Solomon waits, and waits... WE HEAR THE SOUND OF DISTANT HOOFS which grow louder and louder in the manner of rolling thunder. It's Tibeats. He returns with two accomplices; RAMSAY and COOK. They carry with them large whips and a coil of rope. 
TIBEATS Tha's the one. Tha's him. Dismounting, they move with menace that is tinged with perverse pleasure and wordless malevolence. Solomon tries to fight back, but he is strong armed and tied by TIBEATS - his wrists, and then ankles bound in the same manner. In the meantime the other two have slipped a cord within Solomon's elbows, running it across his back and tying it firmly. Solomon is then dragged toward a peach tree. A lynching is in store. The naked horror of it intensely palpable. Solomon looks toward the piazza, but Chapin is now gone. Tears of fear flow down Solomon's cheeks. He is on the verge of panic; a man heading toward his own execution, he begins to struggle and fight. A rope goes around Solomon's neck, then is tossed over the branch of the tree. The trio begin to hoist Solomon. He gasps and gags as spittle flies from his mouth and the life is choked from him. With suddenness, Chapin comes from the house brandishing a pistol in each hand - Colt Paterson .36 caliber "Holster" pistols with 9" barrels. Chapin moves with determination toward the lynch mob. He is sharp and matter of fact. With the guns in hand, he really doesn't need to be much more demonstrative. 
CHAPIN Gentlemen... Whoever moves that nigger another foot from where he stands is a dead man. I am overseer of this plantation seven years, and in the absence of William Ford, my duty is to protect his interests. Ford holds a mortgage on Platt of four hundred dollars. If you hang him, he loses his debt. Until that is canceled you have no claim to his life. Directing his attention to Ramsay and Cook: 
(CONTINUED) 
84 CONTINUED: (5) 84 
CHAPIN (CONT'D) As for you two, if you have any regard for your own safety...I say, begone! Ramsay and Cook don't need to be told twice. The pistols Chapin's gripping make the situation real clear. Without further word, they mount their horses and ride away. Tibeats remains, and his anger with him. 
TIBEATS Yah got no cause. Platt is mine, and mine ta do with as I please. Yah touch my property, I will 'ave yah strung up as well. Tibeats mounts up and departs. There is a surreal moment as Chapin's not sure what to do about Solomon. He chooses to do nothing. Solomon is left dangling by the neck from the tree as Chapin calls to Sam in the 
DISTANCE: 
CHAPIN Sam! Get the mule. You must ride to Master Ford. Tell him to come here at once without a single moment's delay. Tell him they are trying to murder Platt. Hurry, boy. Bring him back if you must kill the mule to do so! 
SAM Yes, suh! Sam mounts up and rides off, the mule demonstrating much speed. 
EXT. FORD PLANATION - LATER 
HOURS HAVE PASSED. The sun is now at its apex. The sight and smell of the red rose bush is more than vivid as Solomon remains tied and dangling exactly where he was left. The scene is both tranquil and horrific. Life on the plantation continues. The OTHER SLAVES work in the field. CHILDREN make their way playfully in the yard. It should all underscore the fact that a black, hanging even partially from a tree, is nothing unusual in this time and space. 
(CONTINUED) 
85 CONTINUED: 85 Chapin walks back and forth with the pistols in his hands. Clearly he fears Tibeats returning with more and better assistance. And yet, he does nothing to alleviate Solomon's suffering. He heeds Tibeats words, and as though caught up in the middle of nothing more than a property dispute, he offers no further aid. Solomon's head lolls to one side. He looks toward the sun. The bright light flares off the leaves and branches of the tree from which Solomon hangs. The glare in Solomon's eyes offering him more pain than solace, but he cannot help but look upward. As he does, his eyes flutter between life and lifelessness... 
OMIT 
87 EXT. FORD PLANATION - LATER 87 
Solomon continues to hang. By now he is drenched in sweat, and nearly delirious with dehydration. His lips dry and parched. He may not die from hanging, but he may very well expire before the day is over. Eventually Rachel comes over - timidly, and as though she were acting contrary to orders - and offers a drink of water from a tin cup, pouring it in Solomon's mouth for him. She then takes a small hand towel and dabs at the water which clings to his lips. Rachel then retreats, and leaves Solomon to hang. 
EXT. FORD PLANATION - EVENING 
The sun is just now arching for the horizon. Solomon remains, as though his torture will not end. Ford, trailed by Sam, finally comes riding up. He dismounts, and moves swiftly over to Solomon. With great heartache: 
FORD Platt... My poor Platt. Ford produces a blade and cuts Solomon loose. Solomon attempts to carry himself, but he cannot. He falls to the ground and passes out. 
INT. FORD PLANATION/GREAT HOUSE - NIGHT 
As we come into the scene, Solomon lays on a blanket on the floor. Eventually, his eyes flutter, then open. He is in the foyer of the Ford house. As he gets his bearings, he looks around the interior. THE SPACE IS HANDSOME, AND WELL DECORATED. It is sharp contrast to the bleak surroundings, shacks and dungeons Solomon has largely been accustom to during his time of slavery. It will be the "first and last time such a sumptuous resting place was granted" during his twelve years of bondage. 
TREACH ...Sir... 
EPPS Damned Queen. Born and bred to the field. A nigger among niggers, and God give 'er to me. A lesson in the rewards of righteous livin'. All be observant ta that. All! 
(BEAT) Now, Treach. Now speak. 
TREACH One hundred thirty eight pounds for Phebe. 
EPPS Hit one forty five yesterday. Pull her out. 
TREACH Two hundred six pounds for Wiley. 
(CONTINUED) 
92 CONTINUED: (2) 92 
EPPS How much he pick yesterday? 
TREACH Two hundred twenty nine pounds. Wiley is pulled from the line, huddled with Solomon. 
EXT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/YARD - EVENING 
In the distance, a flogging is going on. Solomon, Phebe, and Wiley are stripped, placed in a stockade and now being given a perfunctory whipping delivered by ANOTHER 
IDENTIFIED SLAVE. 
EXT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION - EVENING 
Evening, but the day is not yet done. Slaves attend their various evening chores; feeding livestock, doing laundry, cooking food. There is no respite from a slave's charge. 
INT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/SLAVE SHACK - NIGHT 
A fire is kindled in the cabin. The slaves finally fix their own dinner of corn meal. Corn is ground in a small hand mill. The corn meal is mixed with a little water, placed in the fire and baked. When it is "done brown" the ashes are scraped off. Bacon is fried. As the slaves eat, Abram goes on in great length and with much emotion about General Jackson. 
UNCLE ABRAM Hold my words: General Jackson will forever be immortalized. His bravery will be handed down to the last posterity. If ever there be a stain upon "raw militia," he done wiped away on the eight of January. I say da result a that day's battle is of 'mo importance to our grand nation than any occurrence 'fo or since. Great man. Great man in deed. We all need pray to Heavenly Father da General reign over us always. 
INT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/SLAVE SHACK - NIGHT 
The slaves are sleeping. There is a loud commotion. Epps enters, drunkenly, forcing the slaves awake. 
(CONTINUED) 
96 CONTINUED: 96 
EPPS Get up! Get up, we dance tonight! We will not waste the evenin' with yer laziness. Get up. 
INT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/MAIN HOUSE - NIGHT 
Despite the lateness of the hour, the slaves are up and now fully dressed. They take up position in the middle of the floor. They wait, poised like actors. Solomon strikes up a tune; Henry joins in with a pan flute and the slaves dance. They do so very wearily. The whole of it certainly more torture than pleasure. Epps, whip in hand: 
EPPS Where's yah merriment? Move yer feet. As the slaves twirl about Epps keeps an attentive eye on Patsey. It should be quite clear that his primary motivation for holding dances is so that he may view Patsey twirl about the floor. This fact is not lost on Mistress Epps. A few moments of Epps's lust on display is all that the Mistress can bear. Jealousy mounting, she snatches up a CARAFE. With all her might she throws it at Patsey. It hits Patsey square in the face. TOO THICK TO SHATTER, IT LEAVES HER BLOODY AND WRITHING ON THE FLOOR. The dancing, the music stop. The slaves, however, react as though it is not the first time they've seen as much from the Mistress. Mistress Epps, screaming like a hellion: 
MISTRESS EPPS Sell her! 
EPPS C'mon, now. Wha's this? 
MISTRESS EPPS You will sell the negress! 
EPPS You're talkin' foolish. Sell little Pats? She pick with more vigor than any other nigger! Choose another ta go. 
MISTRESS EPPS No other. Sell her! 
EPPS I will not! 
(CONTINUED) 
97 CONTINUED: 97 
MISTRESS EPPS You will remove that black bitch from this property, 'er I'll take myself back to Cheneyville. 
EPPS Back to that hog's trough where I found you? Oh, the idleness of that yarn washes over me. Do not set yourself up against Patsey, my dear. That's a wager on which you will not profit. Calm yerself. And settle for my affection, 'cause my affection you got. Or, go. 'Cause I will rid myself of yah well before I do away with her! Mistress Epps stands irate, lost in fury and unable to even think of what to do. Eventually, optionless, she storms away. For a few beats there is only the sound of Patsey sobbing. 
EPPS (CONT'D) That damned woman! I won't have my mood spoiled. I will not. Dance! Epps sends the whip in Solomon's direction. Solomon responds by playing. Treach literally drags the prone Patsey from the floor, blood still spilling from her face. The slaves, as ordered, return to dancing. 
EXT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION - MORNING 
101 INT. BARTHOLOMEW'S - LATER 101 
A general store in the township of Holmesville. Solomon stands at the counter as BARTHOLOMEW fills Mistress Epps's order. Among the items set before Solomon is a 
QUANTITY OF FOOLSCAP. The items are collected for Solomon and placed in a sack. Solomon giving little thought to them other than getting them back to the mistress. As he turns, he glimpses the regalia of slave restraints, of all different guises; chains, muzzles for sale. 
EXT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/GREAT HOUSE - LATER 
Solomon returns and delivers the items to the Mistress. 
MISTRESS EPPS Any trouble? 
SOLOMON No, ma'am. No trouble. 
OMIT - MOVED TO A105 
104 EXT. SHAW'S HOUSE - DAY 104 
-JULY, 1844- Sitting on the Grand house's Piazza, Patsey is having tea with MISTRESS HARRIET SHAW, WHO IS A BLACK WOMAN. Though once a slave, she is now comparatively refined though not wholly so. The table where they sit is adorned with white linens, and they are attended by a HOUSE NIGGER. It makes for a tranquil surreal scene. 
MASTER SHAW, A WHITE MAN, IS ON THE LAWN GROOMING A 
HORSE. 
A105 EXT. ROAD - DAY A105 
Solomon is running flat out along the road. Running as though his life depended on getting to his destination in beyond a timely manner. 
B105 EXT. SHAW'S HOUSE - DAY B105 
Still running, slick with sweat, Solomon comes upon the 
SHAW HOUSE. As Solomon arrives: 
MASTER SHAW Platt Epps, good Sunday morning. 
SOLOMON Good morning, Master Shaw. I've been sent by Master to retrieve Patsey. May I approach? 
MASTER SHAW You may. Solomon makes his way over to the piazza. 
SOLOMON Excuse me, Mistress Shaw. 
MISTRESS SHAW Nigger Platt. 
SOLOMON My apologies. Patsey, Master wishes you to return. 
PATSEY Sabbath day. I's free ta roam. 
SOLOMON Understood. But the Master sent me running to fetch you, and said no time should be wasted. 
MISTRESS SHAW Drink tea? 
SOLOMON Thank you, Mistress, but I don't dare. 
MISTRESS SHAW Would you knowed Massa Epps's consternation ta be any lessened wit your timely return? Sit. Sit and drink the tea that offered. 
(CONTINUED) 
B105 CONTINUED: B105 Solomon knows better, but he sits and the Mistress has tea poured for him. 
MISTRESS SHAW (CONT'D) What'n was Epps's concern? 
SOLOMON ...I'd rather not say... 
MISTRESS SHAW L'il gossip on the Sabbath be fine. All things in moderation. Solomon is not sure what to say. He struggles to be as diplomatic as possible. 
SOLOMON As you are aware, Master Epps can be a man of a hard countenance. There are times when it is impossible to account for his logic. You know he has ill feelings toward your husband. 
MISTRESS SHAW He do. 
SOLOMON Master Epps has somehow come to believe, as incorrectly as it may be, that Master Shaw is... That he is something of a lothario and an unprincipled man. A misguided belief born out of their mutual competition as planters, no doubt. 
MISTRESS SHAW No doubt...if not born outta truth itself. The Mistress waves to Shaw. Shaw, unsuspecting of the conversation, waves back. 
SOLOMON I'm certain Patsey's well being is Master Epps's only concern. 
EPPS (CONT'D) There; there's all the truth he got. Damned nigger. Damn yah. Epps pushes his way past the Mistress. 
EXT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/FIELD - DAY 
-AUGUST, 1844- With the sun yet again high in the sky the slaves are working the field picking cotton. As before THEY SING A SPIRITUAL, the only thing that distracts them from the tedium at hand. But there is no distracting from the heat. We see Henry begin to falter before it... And eventually collapse right in the dirt. Though the other slaves take note, none move to help him. None dare. From Treach rather matter of factly: 
TREACH Get him water. Edward runs to fetch a gourd. He carries it to Henry, 
DUMPS THE WATER ON HIM, BUT DOES NOT ACTUALLY GIVE HENRY 
ANYTHING TO DRINK. Roused, Henry rights himself. 
EDWARD Go'won. Git up. Unsteadily, Henry lifts himself and goes back to picking cotton. He joins in again with the spiritual, as if the song is all that can keep him going. 
INT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/SLAVE SHACKS - NIGHT 
-OCTOBER, 1844- 
(CONTINUED) 
107 CONTINUED: 107 The slaves are asleep. Epps arrives, again without knocking, with his whip in hand. The slaves stir. Uncle 
ABRAM ASKS: 
UNCLE ABRAM We dance tonight, massa? Epps remains quietly focused on Patsey. And it's clear from her apprehensive expression just what it is he's come looking for. This time there is no escaping it. As if to acknowledge the badness to come, Phebe lightly cries. 
EXT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/SMOKE HOUSE - NIGHT 
On top of a wood pile, in the back of the smoke house - Epps shoves Patsey. He stops, stands as if gathering his manhood, then he's all over Patsey. He is rough and clumsy. It looks like something between an awkward rape and a virgin attempting his first sexual encounter. Patsey does not respond in any way other than to continually turn her head from Epps, but otherwise remain as still as possible. If there is such a thing, she is vicious with her passive aggressiveness. Epps's frustration mounts until - as the Mistress Shaw had cautioned - he crosses the line from passion to violence. He begins slapping Patsey to get a response from her. When that fails, he punches her which only leads to him taking up his whip and lashing Patsey MERCILESSLY. Still, she gives him nothing. Beaten, Patsey sits in the dirt among the cotton, Epps deep breathing above her. The desire for sex now having left him. Epps heads from the field. Patsey is left where she is. 
INT. BARTHOLOMEW'S - DAY 
-NOVEMBER, 1844- As before, Solomon waits as Bartholomew fills Mistress Epps order. Among the items set before Solomon is another quantity of foolscap. 
EXT. ROAD - DAY 
Solomon is making his way back to the Epps plantation. He carries with him a sack filled with the goods from the store. As he walks, SOLOMON LOOKS AROUND CASUALLY. When he is certain he is alone, he sets down the sack, opens it and appropriates A SINGLE SHEET OF THE PAPER which he folds and places in his pocket. That done, he cinches up the sack and continues on his way. 
111 OMIT 111 
112 INT. EPPS'S PLANTATION/SLAVE SHACK - DAY 112 
Solomon takes the slip of paper and hides it within his fiddle. Perhaps the safest place he can think of. He acts as though he's hiding away found gold. In reality it's more than that. For Solomon the paper is a first step toward freedom. 
INT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/MAIN HOUSE - NIGHT 
-DECEMBER, 1844- It's another night of Epps's forced revelry. Coming in quick from the previous scene, we go from Solomon holding his fiddle, to playing it as the slaves are again made to dance. Mistress Epps brings out a tray of freshly baked pastries. She sets them down on a table. 
MISTRESS EPPS A moment from the dancing. Come sample what I baked for y'all. The slaves, thankful for the rest as much as the food, file toward the tray reciting a chorus of "Thank you, Mistress." As Patsey moves toward the pastries: 
MISTRESS EPPS (CONT'D) There'll be none for you, Patsey. Patsey merely turns away. Her non responsiveness, however, serves only to incite the Mistress. Screaming: 
MISTRESS EPPS (CONT'D) Yah see that? Did yah see the look of insolence she give me? 
EPPS Seen nothin' but her turn away. 
MISTRESS EPPS Are you blind or ignorant? It was hot, hateful scorn. It filled that black face. Yah tell me yah did'n see it, then yah choose not to look, or yah sayin' I lie. 
EPPS Whatever it was, it passed. 
MISTRESS EPPS Is that how yah are with the niggers? Let every ill thought fester inside 'em. Look at 'em. 
(MORE) (CONTINUED) 
113 CONTINUED: 113 
MISTRESS EPPS (CONT'D) They foul with it; foul with their hate. You let it be, it'll come back to us in the dark a night. Yah want that? Yah want them black animals to leave us gut like pigs in our own sleep? Epps isn't sure how to respond to the inchoate berating. It's an invitation for the Mistress to continue. 
MISTRESS EPPS (CONT'D) You are manless. A damned eunuch if ever there was. And if yah won't stand for me, I'd pray you'd at least be a credit to yer own kind and beat every foul thought from 'em. Epps does nothing. The Mistress lets her anger loose. She moves quickly to Patsey, DRIVES HER NAILS INTO THE 
PATSEY'S FACE AND DRAWS THEM DOWN ACROSS HER FEATURES. 
FIVE DEEP AND BLOODY GASHES ARE LEFT IN PATSEY'S SKIN, the moment marked with appropriate screams. Patsey collapses on the floor, covering her bleeding face. 
MISTRESS EPPS (CONT'D) Beat it from 'em! Thoroughly cuckolded by the Mistress's actions, Epps takes his whip and pulls Patsey out of the house. His intentions are plain. All the slaves remain silent. The Mistress, however, displaying high satisfaction, entreats the others: 
EPPS (CONT'D) Damn you! Damn you all! Damn you! 
RE-OMIT 
117 EXT. JUDGE TURNER'S PLANTATION - EVENING 117 
-OCTOBER, 1846- Henry, Bob, Uncle Abram and Solomon sit in the back of a cart. SOLOMON HAS HIS FIDDLE WITH HIM. Epps has delivered the men to JUDGE TURNER, a distinguished man and extensive planter whose large estate is situated on Bayou Salle within a few miles of the gulf. Epps and Turner stand off to one side engaged in bargaining as Henry, Bob, Uncle Abram and Solomon wait and watch. One of the slaves whisper under their breath. 
EPPS' SLAVE I hear cutting cane is twice as hard as picking cotton. 
BOB But at least we'll be away from Master Epps. 
UNCLE ABRAM Boy, you two have no sense. Epps returns to his slaves and gives a parting salutation. 
EPPS Yer Judge Turner's for the season. More if need be, until my crop return. Yah'll bring no disrespect to me, and yah'll bring no biblical plagues to him. Be decent, ere mark my words, I will deliver an ungodly whippin'. 
INT. SLAVE SHACK - NIGHT 
(CONTINUED) 
118 CONTINUED: 118 Slaves are crammed into the shack - LITERALLY ON TOP OF EACH OTHER - as they try to sleep. Some lay, some sit up. Packed in like cattle, there is barely room to move let alone draw a deep, clean breath. There is a real risk of suffocating in the mass. Some cough and wheeze. 
A CHILD CRIES... Among them is Solomon who must believe at this point that his life has reached its very lowest point. The odds of survival are slight, let alone the chance of actually ever returning to his family. This clearly weighs on him as he struggles to find anything like comfortable space in the pen. 
EXT. CANE FIELDS - DAY 
An OVERSEER is explaining to the new slaves - SOLOMON AMONG THEM - how to cultivate cane. WITH A KNIFE IN HAND he demonstrates the process: 
OVERSEER Draw the cane from the rick, cut the top and flags from the stalk, understand? Leave only that part which is sound and healthy. Cast off the rest... 
EXT. CANE FIELDS - DAY 
-NOVEMBER, 1846- ABOUT THIRTY SLAVES are working the field. They are divided into THREE GANGS. The first which draw the cane, the next lay the cane in the drill, the last then hoe the rows after. Solomon is among a gang that draws and cuts, and he moves with speed and skill. Certainly more so than he displayed picking cotton. Standing with his overseer, Judge Turner watches. 
INT. SLAVE SHACK - NIGHT 
Again, the slaves have been herded into the shack and pressed together. As he tries to rest - sleep is nearly impossible - Solomon finds himself face to face with a woman, ANNA. She is awake. For a few beats she avoids eye contact with Solomon. She seems, like Solomon, to be unaccustomed to her surroundings and horribly frightened by them. Eventually her eyes meet Solomon's. She makes no sound, but great apprehension spills from her eyes. Whatever's next, whatever horror awaits, she can barely stand to face. Fear, proximity... They drive her hand 
(CONTINUED) 
81A. 
121 CONTINUED: 121 to Solomon's. After a moment of seemingly reacquainting herself with genuine human contact, the woman TAKES 
(CONTINUED) 
121 CONTINUED: (2) 121 SOLOMON'S HAND AND PRESSES IT TO HER BREAST. Solomon tries to jerk his hand away, but ANNA HOLDS IT IN PLACE. Manipulating Solomon's hand, she begins to massage her breast. Solomon takes no real pleasure in the act - really, neither does Anna. THERE SHOULD BE A TRUE SENSE 
ANNA IS JUST SO VERY, VERY DESPERATE FOR HUMAN CONTACT, 
FOR THE NEED TO FEEL ALIVE AND LIKE A PERSON RATHER THAN 
AN ANIMAL THAT EMOTIONALLY SHE IS WILLING TO ENGAGE 
SOLOMON. The need quickly compounds. Anna presses her lips to Solomon's. Eventually, SHE DIRECTS HIS HAND BENEATH HER DRESS AND BETWEEN HER LEGS. Solomon, with slightly more compassion than a guy making union wages, BEGINS TO MANIPULATE ANNA WITH HIS HAND. The act remains more perfunctory than passionate. We can see Anna moving toward climax and eventual release. But more - or substantially less - than joyous sex, it is really just a drug-like inoculation against reality. But the feeling quickly fades. All that remains, as with most chance encounters, is regret. And there is shame, too. This is put on display as Anna turns away from Solomon. As quickly as it began, it is as though the act had not happened at all. 
OMIT 
123 EXT. JUDGE TURNER'S PLANTATION/GREAT HOUSE - EVENING 123 
Solomon waits outside the house on the porch. A house servant - ZACHARY - approaches and admonishes Solomon. 
ZACHARY Off the porch. Get off. Like a dog shooed away, Solomon steps down. Eventually Judge Turner exits the house and crosses to Solomon. 
SOLOMON ...Sir... 
JUDGE TURNER Platt is it? Have you cultivated cane previously? 
SOLOMON No, sir, I have not. 
JUDGE TURNER You take to it quite naturally. Are you educated? 
(CONTINUED) 
123 CONTINUED: 123 
130 EXT. TURNER PLANTATION - NIGHT 130 
-FEBRUARY/MARCH, 1847- Alone out on the edge of the Bayou, Solomon is playing a low air on his violin WHILE SNACKING ON SCRAPS OF BACON. As he plays, something appears in the distance. From the edge of the bayou, coming forth like an apparition arisen from the earth, is CELESTE. She is a young woman of about 19 years of age and far whiter than most blacks. 
"IT REQUIRED CLOSE INSPECTION TO DISTINGUISH IN HER FEATURE THE SLIGHTEST TRACE OF AFRICAN BLOOD." Beyond that, she is pale and haggard, but still lovely. Dressed in a white gown, she emerges from the water. Draped on her dress, her period. A line in her skirt. It's very visible, but not shocking. A ribbon of red in her dress. Celeste moves to Solomon without fear or hesitation. As Solomon, startled, takes her in, Celeste says quite 
PLAINLY: 
CELESTE I am hungry. Give me food. 
SOLOMON Who are you? 
CELESTE I'm hungry. Solomon gives Celeste some of his food. Celeste, famished, devours it. 
SOLOMON What is your name? 
CELESTE My name is Celeste. 
SOLOMON What are your circumstances? 
CELESTE I belong ta Massa Carey, and 'ave been two days among da palmettoes. Celeste is sick and cain't work, and would rather die in the swamp

(CONTINUED) 
130 CONTINUED: 130 
CELESTE (CONT'D) than be whipped to death by the overseer. So I took myself away. Massa's dogs won't follow me. The patrollers 'ave tried to set dem on me. But dey a secret between dem and Celeste, and dey won't mind the devilish orders of the overseer. Celeste lifts her head from the food on which she gnaws. 
CELESTE (CONT'D) Do you believe me? 
SOLOMON Yes. 
CELESTE Why? 
SOLOMON There are some whose tracks the hounds will refuse to follow. 
CELESTE Give me more food. I'm starvin'. 
SOLOMON This is all my allowance for the 
REST OF-- 
CELESTE Give it to me. Almost as if compelled, Solomon does as ordered. As she eats, Celeste aggrandizes herself: 
CELESTE (CONT'D) Most slaves escape at night. The overseers are alert for such chicanes. But Celeste tricked dem 'n alight in the middle of the day wit the sun up at its highest. The place of my concealment now deep in the swamp, not half a mile from Massa's plantation, and a world apart. A world a tall trees whose long arms make fo' a canopy so dense dey keep away even the beams of the sun. It twilight always in Celeste's world, even in the brightest day. I will live there, and I will live freely. The overseers are a cowardly lot. Dey will not go where their dogs show fear and where it always be night. Others will join me in the twilight, and we ain't gunna be slaves no 'mo forever. 
(CONTINUED) 
130 CONTINUED: (2) 130 Solomon isn't sure what to say. Before he can say 
ANYTHING: 
CELESTE (CONT'D) Celeste will come to you again in the night. You will have food for her. Celeste departs the way she came; as though she were a vision. 
INT. JUDGE TURNER'S PLANTATION/FOOD STORAGE - NIGHT 
Solomon stealthfully makes his way into the storage shed. Dried and smoked meats are hung, and milled corn is about. Taking out a handkerchief, Solomon begins to load it with food. Not too much. Not so much his thievery will be readily noticed, but he does avail himself. 
EXT. TURNER PLANTATION - NIGHT 
Solomon plays his violin, but plays it with an anxious nature as he waits. Then, as before, a figure appears in the distance. It is Celeste coming out of the night. She makes her way directly to Solomon. With no greeting, she says: 
CELESTE I am hungry. Solomon gives Celeste the handkerchief he's filled. She opens it, and begins to devour the food. As she eats: 
CELESTE (CONT'D) I was rude, and didn't even ask yo name. 
SOLOMON Platt. 
(BEAT) Solomon. Solomon is my true and free name. 
CELESTE Was you free? 
SOLOMON I was. I am. Solomon exposes his wrist, displays his tattoo as he 
(CONTINUED) 
138 CONTINUED: (2) 138 
SOLOMON Go north. Make your way by night... 
CELESTE It'll only be worse if'n Celeste don't go back of her own will. 
SOLOMON You won't be caught. The dogs won't track you. You are...you are unique. Celeste... 
CELESTE You got alternatives, Solomon. 
SOLOMON To return is to die! 
CELESTE Celeste got no one to write a letter to. As if to punctuate her resolve, without a word more Celeste departs toward the swamp. Solomon starts on into the swamp after her. 
SOLOMON Celeste... Celeste! Solomon continues after Celeste, wading deeper into the dark night and murky waters. 
SOLOMON (CONT'D) Celeste, I will guide you north! Wait, and I will take you. Celeste is too nimble. She outpaces Solomon, continues on and disappears into the night. 
SOLOMON (CONT'D) Let me take you! Let me go with you! Solomon runs on, then splashes to a stop. He stumbles around disoriented, calling into the blackness: 
SOLOMON (CONT'D) Celeste... Nothing. No answer. Not a human one. There are sounds and echoes - some in the distance, some perhaps moving closer - which, moment by moment, become more and more frightening. Soon, Solomon realizes he is in quite literally over his head; the water first chest deep, then neck deep. With no way to orient himself, no means to guide him in the dark, Solomon's reserve begins to crumble. He thrashes in the water trying to find his way 
(CONTINUED) 
138 CONTINUED: (3) 138 back to shore. No longer trying to save Celeste, Solomon calls to her - desperately - for assistance. 
SOLOMON (CONT'D) Celeste! Come to me, Celeste! In that moment Solomon is quite certain he is nearly done; that he will not find land, nor aid and that this is his final moment. His panic should be that tangible. It is either force of will, or survival instinct...or maybe just pure luck that carries Solomon on until he reaches first muddy ground, then firm footing. Hauling himself onto the swamps edge, Solomon finally collapses in a drenched, worn heap. His life spared, but Celeste never to be seen again. 
BLACK 
EXT. EPPS'S PLANTATION - DAY 
-MAY/JUNE, 1847- We come up now outside of Master Epps's plantation. Epps stands in the drive. He's in surprisingly good spirits as Solomon, Uncle Abram, Henry and Bob trudge their way wearily toward Epps and his other slaves who are gathered. The cotton field is in full bloom, the crop fully returned. 
EPPS A joyous day. A joyous day. Dark times is behind us. Clean livin' 'n prayer done lifted the plague. Indicating to the cotton: 
EPPS (CONT'D) As thick 'n white as New England snow. 'N now my niggers is returned to me. 
(TO SOLOMON) Heard Judge Turner gave you favor. Oh, did you beguile him, Platt, with your slick nigger ways? Well, yah won't stand idle, boy. Not on my land. Much work to do. Days of old long since, eh? Joyous! Joyous indeed! Throughout Epps's welcome, Solomon's focus is on Patsey who is lined up with the other slaves. SHE IS NOW MORE HAGGARD THAN WHEN WE LAST SAW HER. Her face and arms display many new scars. It's clear that in the intervening years she has quite literally been a whipping boy for Epps and the Mistress. 
140 EXT. EPPS'S PLANTATION/COTTON FIELD - DAY 140 
-JULY, 1847- The slaves are out working on the field. White hands appear, picking cotton: ARMSBY. He is wholly unskilled at picking cotton, and he puts little effort into the job. As we meet him he seems a decent sort if a little short on self-motivation. In anachronistic terminology, he'd be called a "slacker." He joins in with the slaves, singing a spiritual. 
INT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/GIN HOUSE - EVENING 
As Epps said, it is days of long since. The slaves are back to having their cotton weighed in the Gin House 
EPPS Wiley...? 
TREACH Two hundred sixty pounds. 
EPPS Bob? 
TREACH Three hundred forty pounds for Bob. 
EPPS Patsey? 
TREACH Five hundred twenty pounds. 
EPPS Tha's a girl. Don't never let me down. Platt? 
TREACH One hundred sixty pounds. Before Treach is even done announcing the weight, Epps has pulled Solomon aside to where Uncle Abram already awaits his fate. 
EPPS Armsby? 
TREACH Sixty four pounds. Epps speaks to Armsby sternly, but nothing of the manner in which he would address the slaves. 
(CONTINUED) 
141 CONTINUED: 141 
EPPS A good days labor would average two hundred pounds. 
BOB I just want to say something about Uncle Abram. He was a good man and he always looked out for us since we were little. God Bless him. God love him. And God keep him. That done, they begin to cover it with dirt. It is all the more of a funeral that Abram will receive.

A148 EXT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/SLAVE CEMETERY - LATER A148 
A female voice appears out of the blackness and begins to sing solo, "Went down to the river Jordan." A response of "Oh Yeah" quickly follows. Again the singer continues, "where John baptized three." The same faces we have seen on Epps' plantation, but now filled with rapture, appear. It's as if the voices have created a new form of awakening and presence. It seems to transcend and translate in a strange way, joy. A joy which has un-yet been seen on screen. A joy which has been hidden, but a joy which is undoubtedly there. It's captivating, infectious. This should be a moving part of the film, which stirs the audience and, for a moment, relieves them of the seemingly chastising environment. The singer continues, "Well some say John was a Baptist, some say John was a Jew, but I say John was a preacher, because the Bible says so too, preach on Johnny." And with that, the rest of the congregation chant "I believe. Oh, I believe." 
INT. EPPS'S PLANTATION/WOODS - NIGHT 
Solomon goes to RETRIEVE THE SMALL PACKAGE FROM UNDER A ROCK AT THE BASE OF A TREE. Solomon returns the letter to hiding. He takes the money with him and cautiously moves from the area. 
OMIT 
150 INT. EPPS'S PLANTATION/ARMSBY'S SHACK - LATER 150 
The door opens. Solomon enters. Armsby is surprised to see him. So much so, he isn't sure what greeting to give. Solomon gives a blunt introduction. Re: the 
COINS: 
SOLOMON The proceeds of my fiddling performances. A few picayunes, but all I have in the world. I promise them to you if you will do me the favor I require. But I beg you not to expose me if you cannot grant the request. 
ARMSBY What do you ask? 
SOLOMON First, your word, sir. 
ARMSBY On my honor. 
SOLOMON It is a simple enough request. I ask only that you deposit a letter in the Marksville post office. And that you keep the action an inviolable secret forever. The details of the letter are of no consequence. Even at that, there would be an imposition of much pain and suffering were it known I was the author. A patron is what I require, sir. 
ARMSBY Where's the letter now? 
SOLOMON ...It is not yet written. I will have it in a day. Two at most, my skill with composition as poor as it is. Armsby considers the request. 
ARMSBY I will do it. And will accept whatever payment is offered. Solomon hesitates. In the moment, he's not so sure he can wholly give himself over to trust. 
(CONTINUED) 
150 CONTINUED: 150 
ARMSBY (CONT'D) To assist you, I put my own self at risk. I will do so, but fair compensation is all I ask. Solomon hands over the money. 
ARMSBY (CONT'D) Draw up your letter. We will meet again. In two days? 
SOLOMON In two days. ...Thank you. Solomon exits. 
EXT. EPPS'S PLANTATION/COTTON FIELD - DAY 
Solomon and the slaves pick cotton. Armsby is conspicuously NOT laboring in the field. As Solomon works he is watched by Epps. Watched more than he normally is. For a moment it seems it might just be a matter of perspective; Solomon's unease over his actions. But soon Epps is joined by Armsby. The two men stand and talk, their looks locked toward Solomon. Whatever it is that is occurring between them continues for a long, long moment. But Epps makes no move toward Solomon. Solomon continues with his work. 
INT. EPPS'S PLANTATION/SLAVE SHACK - NIGHT 
The slaves are at rest. Gripping his whip Epps enters, without so much as a knock at the door. For a moment there's curiosity; is he there for a dance, for Patsey...? Looking right to Solomon: 
EPPS Get up. Solomon does. Epps heads back out into the dark. He says nothing, but his directive is clear: Follow me. 
153 EXT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/SLAVE SHACK - CONTINUOUS 153 
Solomon comes out into the dark. Nearly hidden in the shadows is a bitter Epps. Despite the lack of light, Epps's malevolence is quite clear. His whip attached to his hip. As he speaks, he stokes himself with swigs from a FLASK. Epps puts his arm around Solomon, as if consoling a friend, and guides him into the woods.

BASS (CONT'D) evil. But this question of slavery; what right have you to your niggers when you come down to the point? 
EPPS What right? I bought 'em. I paid for 'em. 
BASS Of course you did. The law says you have the right to hold a nigger, but begging the law's pardon...it lies. Is everything right because the law allows it? Suppose they'd pass a law taking away your liberty and making you a slave? 
EPPS Ha! 
BASS Suppose. 
EPPS That ain't a supposable case. 
BASS Because the law states that your liberties are undeniable? Because society deems it so? Laws change. Social systems crumble. Universal truths are constant. It is a fact, it is a plain fact that what is true and right is true and right for all. White and black alike. 
EPPS Whoa, whoa, whoa. Yah compare me to a nigger, Bass? Yah might as well ask what the difference is between a white man and a baboon. Now, I seen one of them critters in Orleans that knowed just as much as any nigger I got. Yah'd call them fellers citizens, I s'pose? 
BASS Look here; you can't laugh me down in that way. These niggers are human beings. If they are allowed to scale no higher than brute animals, you and men like you will have to answer for it. There's an 
ILL-- 
(CONTINUED) 
B155 CONTINUED: (4) B155 
EPPS Ahhh! 
BASS A fearful ill, resting on this 
NATION-- 
EPPS You betray yourself a foreigner! 
BASS That will not go unpunished forever. There will be a reckoning yet. 
EPPS You like to hear yourself talk, Bass, better than any man I know of. Yah'd argue that black was white, or white black if anybody would contradict you. A fine supposition if yah lived among Yankees in New England. But yah don't. 
(POINTED) You most assuredly do not. 
EXT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION - DAY 
It's the Sabbath. The slaves are left to themselves to do their own chores. At the moment the female slaves are washing their clothes in large cauldrons, slapping their clothes against washing boards and hanging them up to dry near to their living quarters behind the plantation. It is a sight of ritual. Missing from the field of labor is Patsey, for whom Epps hollers. 
EPPS Patsey... Patsey! A drunk Epps asks of the slaves: 
EPPS (CONT'D) Where is she? Where is Patsey? No one answers. 
EPPS (CONT'D) Talk, Damn you! 
PHEBE We know nothin' of her, Massa. 
EPPS The hell you don't! You know where she is! She run off, ain't she? She's escaped, and you miserable black dogs stand like 
(MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
155 CONTINUED: 155 
EPPS (CONT'D) the deef and dumb. Speak! Speak! Not a word spoken. 
EPPS (CONT'D) My best cotton picking nigger! My best. A beat. 
EPPS (CONT'D) I'd give yah all up for her. Where she gone? The slaves say nothing. There is nothing for them to say. They don't know where she is. Eventually Epps drops into true sorrow. 
EPPS (CONT'D) She gone... My Pats gone. 
EXT. EPPS'S PLANTATION - LATER 
Epps sits on the piazza looking quite forlorn. He looks up only to see PATSEY RETURNING TO THE PLANTATION. Epps steps up to greet her, with anger rather than relief. As they hear his angry voice, the slaves step around from where they are hanging their laundry to dry. Treach is near as well. 
EPPS Run off. Run off, did you? 
PATSEY Do it, Platt. Don't stop until I am dead. What else can he do? Solomon begins to whip, to truly whip Patsey. Her back welts, then tears... Patsey screams in agony. Solomon strikes again and again... After a full thirty lashes Solomon looks to Epps, who is not satisfied. 
EPPS Until I say no more! I ain't said nothing! Solomon strikes another ten to fifteen times. By now, as promised, Patsey's back has been reduced to LITTLE MORE 
THAN TORN MEAT AND BLOOD. Finally, Solomon holds low the whip. He can and will do no more. 
EPPS (CONT'D) Strike her! Strike her! Solomon will not. Epps takes up the whip and whips Patsey with "ten fold" greater force than he had. The painfully loud and angry curses of Epps load the air. Patsey by now is terribly lacerated, literally flayed. The lash wet with blood which flowed down her sides and dropped upon the ground. At length Patsey ceases struggling. Her head sinks listlessly on the ground. 
(CONTINUED) 
156 CONTINUED: (5) 156 Her screams and supplications gradually decrease and die away into a low moan. It would seem that she was dying. Solomon, screaming at Epps: 
SOLOMON Thou devil! Sooner or later, somewhere in the course of eternal justice thou shalt answer for this sin! Though Epps fronts rage, there should be underlying anguish for what he has done to his beloved Pats. 
EPPS No sin! There is no sin! A man does how he pleases with his property. At the moment, Platt, I am of great pleasure. You be goddamn careful I don't come to wantin' to lightenin' my mood no further. By contrast to this horror, the field of cotton smiles in the warm sunlight. The birds chirp merrily amidst the foliage of the tress. Peace and happiness seems to reign everywhere. Everywhere else. Epps leaves Patsey to herself. He says not a word to the Mistress as he passes. The Mistress herself heads back into the house. Solomon unties Patsey, lifts her and takes her to the cabin. 
INT. CABIN - LATER 
Patsey is laid on some boards where she remains for a long time with eyes closed and groaning in agony. Phebe applies melted tallow to her wounds, and all try to assist and console her. In time Patsey opens her eyes. She looks to Solomon. She does not say a word. She just looks at him...and then her eyes close again.

160 INT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/GREAT HOUSE/ADDITION - 160 
EVENING 
-APRIL, 1852- Solomon and Bass are working together alone on the extension. From the amount of work that's been done on it, it should be obvious that days have now passed. Solomon makes a cautious approach to Bass. As casually as he can he inquires: 
SOLOMON Master Bass, I want to ask you what part of the country you came from? 
BASS No part of this land. I was born in Canada. Now guess where that is. 
SOLOMON Oh, I know where Canada is. I have been there myself. 
BASS Have you? 
SOLOMON Montreal and Kingston and Queenston and a great many places. And I have been in York state, too. Buffalo and Rochester and Albany, and can tell you the names of the villages on the Erie canal and the Champlain canal. Bass gives Solomon a long and curious stare. 
BASS Well traveled for a slave. How came you here? 
SOLOMON Master Bass, if justice had been done I never would have been here. 
BASS How's this? Tell me all about it. 
SOLOMON I am afraid to tell you, though I don't believe you would tell Master Epps if I should. 
BASS Every word you speak is a profound secret. 
(CONTINUED) 
160 CONTINUED: 160 Solomon holds a moment. Hasn't he heard the same promise before? Prior to Solomon stating his case, WE FADE TO: 
161 INT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION / ADDITION - DAY 161 
Hours have passed. Bass reflects on the story that Epps has told in the intervening. 
BASS How many years all told? 
SOLOMON Just nearly...just passed eleven. 
BASS Your story is...it is amazing, and in no good way. 
SOLOMON Do you believe, sir, in justice as you have said? 
BASS I do. 
SOLOMON That slavery is an evil that should befall none? 
BASS I believe so. 
SOLOMON If you truly do, I would ask...I would beg that you write my friends in the north, acquainting them with my situation and beseeching them to forward free papers, or take such steps as they might consider proper to secure my release. Bass looks at Solomon, holding his gaze for more than a prolonged beat. 
SOLOMON (CONT'D) My daughter Margaret is possibly now 19 and my son Alonzo, 16. I miss them so. It would be an unspeakable happiness to clasp my wife and my family again. Bass hands Solomon an end of a long plank of wood and looks over his shoulder, as if to camouflage the conversation by work. They both lift it toward the floorboards. Finally Bass speaks.

FADE IN: 
1   EXT. STREETS OF LONDON - NIGHT                                1 
Autumnal streets seen through the sooty glass of a STREET LAMP. Shadows within shadows. Fog in the air. Full moon. 
WATSON (V.O.) The year was 1891. London was the capital of the world -- the height of modernity, with the hiss of steam and smell of coal in the air. It was also the great cesspool into which all the sinners and criminals of the empire drained. 
Gas hisses audibly, the street lamp ignites, and casts a POOL OF LIGHT onto the street, silhouetting a MAN making his way through the fog and dark shadows with a lantern. 
WATSON (V.O.) I had come to London, ten years prior, to find a life after the Afghan war. I had hoped to start a medical practice and settle into a nice, steady existence. The life I found was anything but nice and steady. 
We can see that the MAN wears a cape. The distinctive silhouette of his deerstalker hat is unmistakable. A FURIOUS CLATTER OF HOOVES APPROACHES in the distance. The MAN tugs on a pipe and turns towards the growing stampede. 
WATSON (V.O.) And that had everything to do with one man. My friend, my partner, my burden... 
The MAN exhales a plume of smoke calmly, giving us the impression that he knows something that we don't. 
WATSON (V.O.) ... Sherlock Holmes. 
WHAM! The MAN in the deerstalker hat is KNOCKED FLAT by A RUNNING MAN who has vaulted over a wall, sending him, his pipe, and hat flying across the cobbles. 
(CONTINUED) 
1   CONTINUED:                                                       1 The RUNNING MAN leans down as if to assist, but instead just picks up the smoker's broken umbrella and studies it. The MAN in the deerstalker hat's eyes widen as he recognizes his famous assailant. 
MAN Sherlock Holmes?! 
SHERLOCK HOLMES offers the handle of the umbrella to the MAN, hauls him to his feet and hands back his broken umbrella. 
HOLMES My apologies. Send the bill to John Watson, 221B Baker Street. 
Sherlock Holmes sprints off down an alleyway.   The MAN takes a step into the road to watch him go -- 
-- and is nearly flattened for good by the first of a number of POLICE CARRIAGES, hurtling by on a serious pursuit, Victorian-style. 
INT. CARRIAGE - CLOSEUP ON THE OFFICERS - NIGHT inside. Big, uniformed guys assemble their weaponry -- a 19th century SWAT team. One man stands out as a leader, older than the rest, INSPECTOR LESTRADE. 
A man in plainclothes sits to one side of the officers: DR. JOHN WATSON, physically as tough as anyone else in the carriage, but with a more pensive air about him. A thinking man of action. 
3   EXT. STREETS OF LONDON - NIGHT                                   3 
Almost tipping over, the carriage turns onto the Embankment and hurtles through the writhing fog along the river. 
As the carriage banks, we see Holmes cut across the carriage path again, taking a line the horses cannot follow. 
CUT TO: 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
Holmes bursts out of an alley, sprints round a corner and runs across a courtyard to a side door. 
WE PULL BACK to see the FACADE OF ST. PAUL'S CATHEDRAL. 
4   OMITTED                                                      4 
5   INT. CATHEDRAL CRYPTS - ENTRANCE - NIGHT                     5 
Holmes enters through the door and stands at the top of a stairwell. He takes a moment to recover; he's fit, but not as fit as he used to be. 
Holmes descends the stairwell to a door and a spiral staircase beyond it. He stops at the doorway and peers round the corner. 
A lantern glow ascends the spiral stairway towards Holmes. Holmes withdraws into the shadows behind the door. A BOWLER-HATTED MAN ascends the stairs, carrying the lantern and a gun. 
He peers behind the door and holds the lantern up to the shadows, but does not see Holmes, who has pulled his black jacket up to conceal his face. The man swings the lantern away again. He peers about, confused. 
We see Holmes' eyes from the shadows, as he lowers his jacket and thinks through his plan of attack. 
HOLMES (V.O.) Head cocked to the left, partial deafness in right ear. First point of attack. 
PRE-VISUALIZATION IN VARI-SPEED 
FOCUS ON the spot behind the man's right ear, just at the top of the jaw -- the most vulnerable point. Holmes launches a hammer blow, and we ramp from 24 fps to 400 fps (ULTRA SLOW MOTION) as he makes contact. The man's head is thrown back as he spins round. 
HOLMES (V.O.) Then throat, paralyze vocal chords, stop screaming. 
BACK TO 24 fps. The man's mouth opens to cry out. We RAMP BACK UP TO 400 fps as his Adam's Apple is struck with a precision karate chop, strangling his scream. 
HOLMES (V.O.) Stink of alcohol, heavy drinker -- knuckles to liver. 
BACK TO 24 fps, RAMPING TO 400 fps as a devastating knuckle-punch to the liver doubles up the bowler-hatted thug and crumples him to his knees. (CONTINUED) 
5   CONTINUED:                                                       5 SECOND-TIME ACTION - SUPER FAST REPEAT OF ABOVE 
Holmes flashes out of the shadows, moving so fast that we can barely see what he's doing. 
THWACK! Hammer blow to ear. CRACK! Karate chop to throat. WHAP! Knuckle punch to liver. 
BACK TO NORMAL MOTION as the man crumples to the ground, Holmes takes his bowler hat from his head and flips it onto his own in one super fast move. 
Holmes drags the battered man into the shadows, lifts his lantern and proceeds down the spiral staircase. 
POV - BOTTOM OF THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE 
Another bowler-hatted THUG approaches the bottom of the staircase. He has seen the lantern light. He draws his gun and approaches. Holmes places the lantern on the post at the bottom of the bannister, ducks down into the shadows. 
WATSON Lord Blackwood?! Blackwood applauds softly, strangely. 
BLACKWOOD Well done, Holmes. And Watson as well. 
Watson raises his gun, trains it on Blackwood. 
WATSON Stay right there. 
Blackwood raises his hands in front of him, almost mockingly. 
BLACKWOOD Tell me, doctor, as a medical man, how did you like my work? (beat) The fifth one was so scrawny, it was over before I'd finished the first incision. 
That's more than Watson can take.   He moves in to pistol- whip Blackwood -- 
-- is stopped suddenly by Holmes' hand grabbing his collar. 
HOLMES No. 
Watson struggles forward against Holmes' grip. 
HOLMES Look. 
(CONTINUED) 
9A   CONTINUED: (2)                                                9A Holmes seems to be pointing at Blackwood.   Watson looks, sees nothing. 
HOLMES Look. 
Watson looks, and sees it and his eyes flare wide. 
INCHES FROM WATSON'S RIGHT EYE is the needle-pointed end of a QUIVERING PIECE OF HIGH-TENSILE WIRE, almost invisible -- 
-- the other end held between Blackwood's hands.    A really nasty concealed weapon. 
One more step and Watson gets impaled in the eye. 
BLACKWOOD What a shame.    That would've been fun. 
We hear heavy boots on the balcony, as Lestrade and his men finally appear. 
POLICEMEN flood the area. 
HOLMES Impeccable timing, Lestrade. 
LESTRADE (vis Blackwood) Is that -- ? 
WATSON It is. 
HOLMES (re: girl) We've gone for the doctor... (re: Blackwood) And one for the rope. 
LESTRADE You should've waited for my help. 
HOLMES If I had, you'd be cleaning up a corpse and chasing a rumor. Besides, the girl's parents hired me, not the Yard. (a wry smile) I can't imagine why they thought you'd need any assistance. 
(CONTINUED) 
9A    CONTINUED: (3)                                              9A Lestrade turns, frustrated. He watches his men yank Blackwood out of his double circle, put chains on him, while others carry the girl away on a stretcher. She's still mouthing the incantation. 
Lestrade eyes the double circle, the pentacle, shakes his head, not understanding them. 
Grudgingly, reluctantly, hating himself for needing to, he turns to Holmes. 
LESTRADE What do you make of that? 
HOLMES Some kind of ceremony. Five girls killed beneath cathedrals at the height of the full moon. (indicating) The double circle's for his own protection. 
LESTRADE London will breathe a sigh of relief -- 
WATSON -- at the excellent work of Scotland Yard. As usual. 
HOLMES Bravo, Lestrade. Have a cigar. 
Holmes sticks the villain's cigar in Lestrade's pocket and -- 
-- A POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER lifts his massive camera. 
FLASH! An explosion of light and sparks as a 19th century flashbulb pops. The SCENE is FROZEN bright for a split-second and then it FADES. 
CREDIT SEQUENCE BEGINS, MUSIC AND TITLES OVER -- 
OMITTED 
10A   INT. LAB                                                    10A 
Dim light from a burner heats fluid in a jar, a bench strewn with scientific equipment. Gloved hands mix chemicals in a tray, a piece of photo paper on top. 
10B   INT. NEWSPAPER LIBRARY                                       10B 
Another pair of hands search urgently through a row of alphabetized files, coming to rest on the letter "H." A bunch of "H" clippings hit the desk. The top one reads: 
STUDENT AND ARMY DOCTOR SOLVE LONDON MYSTERY! A photo of Holmes and Watson in their 20s at a crime scene. Their eyes are shut for the photo, unaccustomed to flashes. 
10C   INT. LAB                                                     10C 
Chemicals are poured over the paper and spread across it. 
10D   INT. NEWSPAPER LIBRARY                                       10D 
Hands flip through more papers, more headlines: STUDENT AND DOCTOR BEAT COPS TO THE PUNCH AGAIN! ROOMMATES SOLVE BRIXTON MURDERS! Another picture of Holmes and Watson. This time, they look more confident, the article bigger. 
Another headline: HOLMES AND WATSON OPEN FOR BUSINESS. Holmes and Watson stand in front of 221 Baker Street. 
10E                                                                10E INT. LAB A negative is clipped over the paper.    A sudden flash of light as it is exposed. 
10F   INT. NEWSPAPER LIBRARY                                       10F 
Another headline: DOCTOR AND DETECTIVE FOIL JEWELRY SCAM! A picture of Holmes and Watson, holding a goose by its feet and smiling. The men are front page news now. 
WATSON It needs work.     May I see?... 
Watson passes him heading to the other side of the room (possibly grabs the gun) picking up a pile of open letters from a table. 
HOLMES Gently, gently, Watson... 
Watson whips open more curtains and opens a window. 
Holmes crawls on his hands and knees over to a table where he finds his sunglasses and puts them on. 
Watson sits on a chair and begins to leaf though the letters. 
(CONTINUED) 
14   CONTINUED:                                                    14 WATSON It's been three months since the last case. About time you found another one. 
HOLMES I can't but agree. My mind rebels at stagnation. Give me problems, give me work. The sooner the better. 
WATSON Paper? 
Watson hands Holmes the newspaper. 
WATSON Let's see, we have a letter here from Mrs. Ramsey in Queen's Park -- her husband has gone missing. 
HOLMES He's in Belgium with the scullery maid. Is it December? 
WATSON Yes, Holmes. Lady Radford reports a missing emerald bracelet. 
HOLMES Insurance swindle. Lord Radford likes fast women and slow ponies. I see you're the attending physician at Blackwood's hanging. 
WATSON Yes, it's our last case together and I wanted to see it through to the end. 
Awkward pause.   Cough. 
WATSON Mr. Lewis is seeking... 
Mrs. Hudson enters carrying a tray of bread and tea.    She is steeling herself for this interaction. 
HOLMES (to Watson) There is only one case that intrigues me at present... the curious case of Mrs. Hudson, the absentee landlady. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
14   CONTINUED: (2)                                               14 HOLMES (CONT'D) I have been studying her comings and goings and they appear most sinister. 
MRS. HUDSON Tea, Mr. Holmes. 
Mrs. Hudson crosses to Holmes and puts the tray before him. 
HOLMES Is it poisoned, nanny? 
MRS. HUDSON There's enough of that in you already. 
She goes to remove an old tray from behind him. 
HOLMES Don't touch that. Everything is in its proper place, as per usual. 
She ignores him and removes the tray then crosses back towards the door noticing a bulldog lying unconscious under the table. 
MRS. HUDSON He's killed the dog... again. 
Watson jumps up. His bulldog, GLADSTONE, lies on the floor in a drugged stupor. 
WATSON What have you done to Gladstone this time? 
HOLMES I was simply testing a new anesthetic. He doesn't mind. 
WATSON Holmes!   As your doctor... 
HOLMES He'll be right as a trivet in no time. 
Watson's finally had enough. 
(CONTINUED) 
14   CONTINUED: (3)                                              14 WATSON ... and your friend, you've been in this room for two weeks. I insist you get out of here. 
HOLMES There's nothing of interest to me out there, on earth, at all. 
WATSON So, you have nothing to do? 
HOLMES Nothing. 
WATSON Then you're free this evening. 
HOLMES Absolutely. 
WATSON For dinner. 
HOLMES Wonderful. 
WATSON The Royale. 
HOLMES My favorite. 
WATSON Mary's coming. 
HOLMES Not available. 
WATSON You're meeting her, Holmes. 
HOLMES Have you proposed yet? 
WATSON I'm still looking for the right ring. 
A little smile from Holmes. 
HOLMES Then it's not official. 
(CONTINUED) 
As Holmes talks, Watson gets up, moves to help Mary to her feet. They're leaving. 
HOLMES Or at least until someone informed you of its true and rather modest worth, at which point you broke off the engagement and returned to England for better prospects. A doctor perhaps. 
Mary throws Watson's wine in Holmes' face. The restaurant goes silent. She turns to leave, turns back. 
MARY (low) Right on all counts but one. I didn't leave my fiance... he died. 
Now she leaves -- 
(CONTINUED) 
15     CONTINUED: (6)                                               15 WATSON Well done, old man. 
-- and Watson goes with her. 
Holmes lets the wine drip down over him. 
HOLMES She's lovely. 
Holmes is left at an empty table with wine running down his face. 
Their orders arrive -- an array of plates piled high. The waiter puts them down, Holmes very carefully unfolds his napkin and places it into the top of his shirt, spaghetti style, takes his knife and fork and begins to cut the meat -- then pauses, looks around. 
HOLMES' POV 
Happy couples eating, laughing, talking. Suddenly, Holmes hears no words. He just sees their mouths moving. The sound of silverware clinking and scraping on fine china rises to an ORCHESTRAL ROAR -- 
-- which becomes the ROAR of a BLOOD-THIRSTY MOB as a fist smashes into a face with a MEATY THUD. 
15A-17 OMITTEDINT. PUNCH BOWL PUB - BARE-KNUCKLE BOXING FIGHT - 5A-17 NIGHT 
Holmes staggers back from the blow. He tastes his own blood from a split lip. It interests him. He is stripped to the waist, all sinew and gristle. His opponent, McMURDO -- huge but flabby -- bangs his fists together and moves in. 
Bets rage back and forth through the pressing CROWD. 
HOLMES' POV 
The room and the fight are calm -- the sounds muffled and indistinct -- a complete sensory reversal of his experience in the restaurant. This is soothing to him, the ring is the only place where his mind stops racing. 
(CONTINUED) 
15A-17 CONTINUED:                                               15A-17 He's able to feel, not just think.    He is utterly in the moment. 
Holmes' hawk-sharp gaze darts down from McMurdo's face to his muscles as they flex, giving him just enough warning to move his head so that a punch grazes him. 
BACK TO SCENE 
McMurdo throws a storm of punches, most of which Holmes ducks or blocks. He throws nothing in return, sometimes even drops his hands, just using his reflexes to protect himself. 
Once or twice, he reaches out and gently touches McMurdo's face or throat, when the big man leaves an obvious opening. But that's all. Holmes is completely in control -- 
-- until he notices a face at ringside. 
CLOSEUP ON A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN 
Early thirties, a look of pure intrigue in her eyes and a slight smile on her lips as she watches the detective. 
Holmes' POV returns to normal when he sees her, the sound floods back into the room. 
McMurdo senses his opponent's lapse in concentration and steps on Holmes' foot, tramping him and -- 
He knocks Holmes down with a thunderous right. 
Holmes rolls over, stands, shakes his head to clear the cobwebs. He looks for the woman. She's gone. He turns back to McMurdo, smiles. 
HOLMES Well done.   Thank you. 
Holmes begins walking away. 
McMURDO Oi!   We ain't done here. 
HOLMES (walking away) Not done. Finished. And as I said, thank you, it was most pleasurable. 
(CONTINUED) 
15A-17 CONTINUED: (2)                                             15A-17 Face twisted in disgust, McMurdo strides forward and SPITS CONTEMPTUOUSLY at Holmes, catching him on the back of the head. The crowd falls silent. 
Holmes stops.     Feels the back of his head, smells his hand. 
HOLMES Hm.   Plymouth gin. 
He turns.   Steps back into the ring. 
The crowd applauds, working into a fever pitch, but from Holmes' POV, all is calm. His eyes tick slowly, scanning McMurdo, locking onto the big man's knee: 
A little scar-tissue, nearly invisible.    As McMurdo braces for combat -- 
Instantly Holmes unleashes a series of superfast moves, incorporating exotic martial arts. The blinding combination culminates with a spinning kick to the big man's knee, which buckles altogether wrong. 
McMurdo falls, over and out. Holmes is already turning away before the giant hits the canvas. 
He sees the crowd fall silent, they're not sure if they like it, there really isn't any sport. He doesn't care. 
Passing fellow fighters and flirty barmaids, Holmes strides out of the bar, battered on the outside, soothed inside. He grabs a bottle in his hand. Taking a huge swig, he climbs the stairs towards the upstairs rooms. 
18A                                                                   18A INT. PENTONVILLE PRISON - CORRIDOR - NIGHT A candle shivers, casting jagged shadows. A row of stone cells. The sound of prisoners SCREAMING in the dark. A full-scale riot is on. 
Five GUARDS charge down the corridor, banging on the doors to quiet the prisoners. 
The GUARD CAPTAIN approaches a young guard, CHARLIE, who is frozen on the spot. 
GUARD CAPTAIN Charlie, what the hell's going on down here? 
(CONTINUED) 
18A   CONTINUED:                                                  18A CHARLIE It's Jack, he tried to stop Blackwood from doing his spells. And now he's in some kind of fit. 
HOLMES You have the grand gift of silence, Watson. It makes you quite invaluable as a companion. 
Watson punches him square in the face. 
WATSON And your grand gift is the uncanny ability to demoralize people. I was aware she'd been engaged. She told me. Holmes rubs his jaw. 
HOLMES So that's a `no' to the opera then? 
Watson's steaming.   Holmes puts on his vest. 
WATSON That's my waistcoat. 
HOLMES It's too small for you. 
WATSON Well, it's my property and I want it back. (CONTINUED) 
26aA. 23   CONTINUED: (2)                                             23 Holmes hands him the waistcoat which he promptly tosses out of the carriage window. Holmes frowns, looks out the opposite window. 
26A. 
24   EXT. PENTONVILLE PRISON - EARLY MORNING                     24 
Already a CROWD is gathering outside the jail, papers are for sale, Blackwood's death is the headline. Religious zealots and occultists swarm. Police keep them away from the entrance. Holmes heads inside, Watson stops. 
WATSON You go ahead. I've no business with him while he's alive. 
25   OMITTED                                                     25 
26   INT. PENTONVILLE PRISON - CORRIDOR - DAWN                    26 
A pale, nervous GUARD leads Holmes down the shadowy corridor. All the cells are now EMPTY. 
HOLMES Where are all the other prisoners? 
GUARD We had to move `em, sir, otherwise we were going to have a riot on our hands. There's something about him... it's like he can get inside your head. 
Holmes can see how spooked the Guard is. 
HOLMES I'm sure I can find my own way from here, if you have other duties to attend to. 
GUARD Much obliged, sir. Thank you, thank you. 
The Guard high-tails it out of there. 
INT. PENTONVILLE PRISON - BLACKWOOD'S CELL - DAY Holmes approaches Blackwood's cell, strolling insouciantly. No way this creep's getting to him. In the shadows he can barely make out Blackwood, who's reading aloud to himself. Holmes listens, getting closer. BLACKWOOD QUOTE from Revelations tbd... 
Blackwood pauses, turns, sees Holmes. 
They share a smile -- two heavyweights sizing each other up. 
HOLMES Love what you've done with the place. 
BLACKWOOD Thank you for joining me. 
(CONTINUED) 
27   CONTINUED:                                                   27 HOLMES A small point of concern. 
BLACKWOOD How can I help? 
HOLMES I'd already followed the murders with some interest and while my heart went out to the families of the victims, I couldn't but notice a criminal mastery in the stroke of your brush -- 
BLACKWOOD You're too kind. 
HOLMES However, by comparison, your work in the crypt was akin to a finger painting. 
Suddenly, Blackwood is right at the bars, close to Holmes. 
BLACKWOOD So now you're curious as to whether there's a larger game afoot, and that's why you're really here. 
HOLMES Actually, my friend will pronounce you dead shortly and I thought I might keep him company. 
BLACKWOOD Allow me to enlighten you. Your mistake is to imagine that anything earthly has led to this moment. Your error in judgement is to assume I've been holding the brush at all -- I am merely the channel. 
Despite the bars between them, the men are close together. Holmes seems to be studying Blackwood's ear. 
(CONTINUED) 
27   CONTINUED: (2)                                               27 HOLMES My only wish is that I'd caught you earlier. I might have spared five lives. 
BLACKWOOD Those lives were a necessity, a sacrifice. Five otherwise meaningless creatures called to serve a greater purpose. 
HOLMES I wonder if they'd let Watson and I dissect your brain -- after you're hanged, of course. I'd wager there's some deformity that would be scientifically significant. Then you would serve a greater purpose, too. 
BLACKWOOD Mr. Holmes, you must widen your gaze. I'm concerned you underestimate the gravity of coming events. (beat) For you and I are bound on a journey that will twist the very fabric of nature. (beat) I sense fragility beneath your mask of logic, and it worries me. Steel your mind, Holmes, I need you. 
Holmes steps back, shakes his head. 
HOLMES I must say, you've come a long way down from the House of Lords. 
BLACKWOOD But I will rise again. 
HOLMES Bon voyage, Blackwood. 
As Holmes walks away, Blackwood calls after him. 
BLACKWOOD Pay attention! Three more shall die, and there is nothing you can do to save them. (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
29A. 27   CONTINUED: (3)                                               27 BLACKWOOD (CONT'D) You must accept that this is beyond your control, or by the time you realize it was you that made it all possible it will be the last sane thought in your head. 
28   INT. PENTONVILLE PRISON - CORRIDOR - MORNING                 28 
Holmes walks down the corridor, meets Lestrade and a PRIEST. The place is bustling with cops and officials. 
LESTRADE What did he want? 
42A-50 OMITTE                                                  42A-50 
51     EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY                                     51 
Holmes stands in the middle of the street contentedly observing humanity. Watson ENTERS FRAME and hands Holmes a bundle wrapped in newspaper. 
WATSON I fail to see how these fish and chips are different from the three other places we passed along the way. 
HOLMES Trust me. (CONTINUED) 
42A. 51   CONTINUED:                                                  51 WATSON Just eat. 
Holmes complies hungrily and they start to stroll along. Watson appears preoccupied. 
WATSON You know, I've seen things in war that I couldn't explain. I once heard a man predict his death, down to the number and placement of the bullet holes that killed him. You have to admit that a supernatural explanation is at least theoretically possible. 
(CONTINUED) 
51   CONTINUED: (2)                                               51 HOLMES (mouth full, near indecipherable) Never theorize before you have data. Invariably, you end up twisting facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts. Adler's midget is the key to this. 
Holmes pulls out a JEWELER'S LOUP, screws it into his eye, and flips Reordon's watch open. He examines the lid. 
HOLMES Hmm... scratches around the keyhole, what does that tell you? 
WATSON The owner was most likely a drunk. Each time he wound the watch his hand would slip, hence the scratches. 
HOLMES Very good, Watson! You've developed considerable powers of your own. 
Watson looks quite chuffed. 
HOLMES Let's see now, there are several sets of initials scored into the lid. 
WATSON Pawnbroker's marks. 
HOLMES Excellent. 
Watson looks extremely pleased with himself until they turn a corner into a street where EVERY SECOND SHOP IS A PAWN SHOP. His face falls. 
HOLMES The most recent is M.H... 
Watson shakes his head. 
WATSON Maddison and Haig.

WE SEE MADDISON & HAIG, PAWNBROKERS, RESPECTABLE, DISCREET, ahead of them there on Bow Street. 
WATSON There's one thing you've missed. On the watch. 
HOLMES I think not. 
WATSON The time. Which leads me to deduce that I'm already late for my appointment with Mary. You remember, the one I was leaving for before you talked me into coming to dig up dead bodies with you. 
A GYPSY PALM READER approaches Watson as he turns to leave. 
PALM READER Reckon your future, sir? 
HOLMES Perhaps we do need a little help from the beyond. 
WATSON No, thank you. 
She grabs his hand anyway. 
PALM READER You need to hear what I have to tell you. 
Watson is so taken aback by the urgency and gravity of her tone that he doesn't pull away. 
PALM READER I see two men, brothers. Not in blood but in bond. I see the letters S and an L, no... wait, a J. 
Holmes and Watson look at each other.   She has their attention.

43B. 51   CONTINUED: (4)                                               51 PALM READER (wincing) I see madness. A man driven out of his mind by a malign force. 
Watson looks at Holmes. 
PALM READER I see a letter... the letter M... another M... Mary? You will be married... I see... I see... (horrified) Patterned table clothes, china figurines, lace doilies... 
Watson snatches his hand away. 
WATSON You think you are clever don't you? 
Holmes feigns innocence. 
PALM READER She turns to fat... 
WATSON Enough. 
The Palm Reader looks at Holmes. 
HOLMES (to Watson) Do you have any changes? 
Watson shakes his head as he pays the woman. 
WATSON This is a new low -- even for you. 
(CONTINUED) 
51   CONTINUED: (5)                                               51 HOLMES It's the most honest prediction old Flora has made in years. And you know it yourself, Watson. That is precisely the reason you can't find a suitable ring. You're terrified of a life without the thrill of the macabre, as well you should be. 
Holmes swallows the last of his cod and casts the wrapping aside, pleased with himself. 
WATSON Do you still have my cut from the fight? 
BOOM!   The door WHIPS open.    TWO THUGS spill into the room. 
(CONTINUED) 
58   CONTINUED:                                                     58 They are followed by DREDGER, a huge man, just shy of seven feet tall and pushing 400 pounds, slightly deformed, who follows them into the room. He sucks on a twisty stick of barley sugar (Victorian hard candy). 
They stop, surprised to see Holmes and Watson.    Holmes' eyes widen at the giant. 
HOLMES Hello, gentlemen. 
Dredger is deadpan. 
DREDGER Sherlock Holmes. 
HOLMES Let me guess -- you're here to extinguish any connection between the man who lived here and the man you work for? Curious you'd still be running errands for a dead man. 
DREDGER (smiles) You do like to talk. 
The two thugs step toward Holmes and Watson. 
HOLMES You take them, I'll handle Mr. Sweet tooth. 
WATSON Seems about fair. 
Watson meets the men in the middle of the room, swinging at them. As they dodge and swing back -- 
Holmes grabs a standing lamp, sliding it into his hand as a weapon. He looks at Dredger, knows it won't make a dent. He keeps moving, swinging the lamp toward a CURTAIN. In the blink of an eye: 
He WRAPS UP the curtain, ripping it down, bringing the heavy STEEL ROD with it. He catches the rod, flipping it so the curtain-rings rain to the floor. 
He spins the rod expertly, SMASHING it into Dredger's face. It stuns the giant for a beat, but quickly -- 
Dredger LUNGES forward, trapping the steel rod under his arm. He grabs the rod and HURLS Holmes through the air, sending him flying into --

Holmes crash-lands on the table, scattering all the bottles and tools. He blinks, trying to gather his senses. He sees Dredger incoming, as -- 
Watson tussles with the thugs, a bar-room brawler.    Head butting one, kicking the other in the groin. 
The men whip out knives. Watson ducks and dodges, blades flashing on either side of him. One of the blades slices his shirt, ripping off his pocket, so -- 
The ENGAGEMENT RING falls to the floor. One of the thugs accidentally KICKS it, sending it across the ground. 
As Watson follows the ring with his eyes, the first man HURLS his knife. Watson just barely ducks the blade, which SMACKS into the second thug, who falls. Watson fights the first thug, as he scrambles toward the ring. 
58A                                                                 58A INT. REORDON'S LAB Dredger bears down on Holmes. Holmes reaches out for some kind of weapon, anything he can grab. He snatches a SHORT SHAFT. A truly pathetic weapon. 
Dredger lurches toward Holmes, who swings the metal shaft desperately, and... the shaft SPARKS. 
ZAP! A flash of light and crackle, and Dredger gets an ELECTRIC SHOCK that sends him flying back twenty feet -- 
58B   INT. REORDON'S ROOMS                                          58B Watson finishes off his thug and plucks the engagement ring off the floor, just as -- 
Dredger flies through the air, SLAMMING into Watson, knocking him off his feet, and knocking the ring away. 
Holmes looks at the lightning rod in his hand, stunned by the efficacy of the weapon. 
Dredger tries to recover, climbing off of Watson.    Holmes cranks his weapon. The rod sparks and hums. 
Dredger pulls himself up with the help of a water pipe on the wall. Holmes thinks quickly, then touches the other end of the pipe with the rod, and ZZZAPPPP!! 
The electrical current RUNS ALONG THE PIPE, and KNOCKS Dredger back twenty more feet. (CONTINUED) 
58B     CONTINUED:                                                  58B Watson spots the ring rolling towards the window, starts running for it, frantic as -- 
Dredger rises, a clear change in his demeanor. He looks at the sparking rod and races for the window as well. 
Watson chases the engagement ring, bends down... just as he's about to grab it... 
THUD!   Dredger's massive foot STOMPS DOWN ON THE RING. 
Dredger gives Watson a cruel smile, then leaps out the window, landing atop a heap of coal. Watson glares as -- 
Holmes blasts past him, leaps out the window.   Watson picks up the ring, sees: 
The stone was knocked out of the setting, lost in the floorboards, the rest of the ring mangled. Watson darkens, grips his ruined ring, and heads out --

Dredger runs towards a SLIPWAY, which holds the UNFINISHED HULL OF A LARGE SHIP. The vessel can't be far from completion; it sits in a wheeled carriage designed to see it smoothly into water. 
63      EXT. UN-LAUNCHED SHIP - FIRST SLIPWAY                          63 
For now though, big wooden chocks hold it in place, the whole thing is attached to a heavy chain that coils back around the shed that they just ran through. 
Holmes trails the hulking form of Dredger into this network of struts. They weave through the shadows. 
Holmes sees one of the cables shifting slightly.    He takes an angle to cut off Dredger, and -- (CONTINUED)

Dredger knows there isn't much juice left. He reaches out, grabs the weapon and... smiles a terrifying smile. A moment of reckoning between Holmes and Dredger: 
The shaft slowly... sizzles... out. Dredger tosses the rod. And now, Holmes backs away, as -- 
Dredger grabs a sledgehammer, and swings the hammer at Holmes, smashing some of the wooden supports, tearing others out of his way. The ship LURCHES forward. 
Watson now turns away, completely irritated at Holmes' lack of understanding. 
HOLMES What you need is a rest. You and I could go out to the countryside. My brother Mycroft has a small estate near Chichester. It has marvelous grounds and a beautiful folly. We could throw a lamb on the spit. 
Watson shakes his head in disbelief. 
WATSON If I were going to the country, I would be going with my future wife -- 
HOLMES Certainly. We should have her along. Let's get Gladstone out of the house as well. 
WATSON No, Holmes. Not you.   Me and her. You're not -- 
HOLMES Invited? Now you're not making any sense, Watson. Why would I not be invited to my own brother's country home?

He touches his own heart.   They hear a BILLYCLUB hit the bars. 
PRISON GUARD John Watson?   You made bail. 
Watson steps up. Holmes looks confused.    He steps forward. But the Guard shakes his head. 
PRISON GUARD Just Watson. 
As he slides open the bars, they see... MARY emerges from behind the Guard. Watson stands for a beat between Holmes and Mary. He must make a decision. And he does -- 
-- he leaves. 
Holmes watches him walk out, then locks eyes with Mary. She gives him a polite nod, turns, heads off with Watson. The bars slide shut. 
The mob surrounds Holmes.   He's never looked more alone.

HOLMES Lestrade -- your usual impeccable timing. 
LESTRADE You know, in another life, you'd have made an excellent criminal. 
HOLMES And you, sir, an excellent policeman. 
69   EXT. LONDON JAIL - DAY                                       69 
Holmes and Lestrade march along. Lestrade holds out a copy of the newspaper. The headline reads: "BLACKWOOD LIVES AND THE DEVIL WALKS WITH HIM! MURDERER RESURRECTED!" 
LESTRADE Tell me you have answers. 
HOLMES All in good time. 
LESTRADE We don't have time. I've an office full of policemen hanging crosses over their desks. A public that's working itself into a frenzy... Holmes sees a dark, strange carriage waiting, door open. 
HOLMES Who's this? 
LESTRADE Try to behave yourself. They just paid a small fortune to bail you out.

FADE IN: 
72   INT. TEMPLE OF FOUR ORDERS HEADQUARTERS                         72 
The hood is pulled off. Holmes takes in the scene, eyes flicking around the room. 
He's in a grand office where a man in his late 60s, SIR THOMAS, rises from a pile of papers. 
SIR THOMAS Mr. Holmes, apologies for summoning you like this. I'm sure it's quite a mystery as to where you are, and who I am. 
HOLMES As to where I am -- I was, admittedly, lost for a moment between Charing Cross and Holborn. But I was saved by the bread shop on Saffron Hill, the only bakers to use a certain French glaze on their loaves. After that, the carriage forked left, then right, a bump over the Fleet conduit -- need I go on? 
Somewhat stunned, Sir Thomas shakes his head. 
HOLMES As to who you are -- that took every ounce of my not- inconsiderable experience and skill... the letters on your desk are addressed to Sir Thomas Rotheram, Lord Chief Justice. That would be your official title. Who you realy are is another matter entirely. 
Sir Thomas is not in the mood for this -- but Holmes is on a roll. 
(CONTINUED) 
56A. 72   CONTINUED:                                                    72 HOLMES Judging by the sacred Ox on your ring, you're also the secret head of the Temple of the Four Orders -- in whose headquarters we now stand, on the northwest corner of St. James Square. (beat) And as to the mystery -- the mystery is why you bothered to blindfold me in the first place. 
SIR THOMAS Yes, well, it's standard procedure, I suppose. 
Holmes shakes his head; what a massive lack of judgement on their part. 
STANDISH (O.S.) I think we have the right man. 
Holmes turns to see JOHN STANDISH and LORD COWARD standing behind him. Standish is an American in his sixties. Coward is a hard, ambitious man in his 30s. 
(CONTINUED) 
72   CONTINUED: (2)                                               72 SIR THOMAS Sherlock Holmes, Ambassador Standish from America and Lord Coward, the Home Secretary. 
Irene gets up, walks behind a DRESSING SCREEN. 
IRENE (behind screen) The eye patch was a nice touch. 
HOLMES But I've never known a professor to carry a gun, and on such a clever contraption. 
IRENE (O.S.) Let's not argue. 
HOLMES We're not. 
Irene steps out, now wearing an array of Victorian undergarments. Unfairly gorgeous. The huge DIAMOND still around her neck. She moves back to the dressing table. 
Holmes won't look at her, refusing to get turned on. 
HOLMES Tell me who you're working for and what he's after. 
IRENE That's nobody's business but my own.

61A. 75   CONTINUED: (2)                                                75 HOLMES I disagree. 
IRENE You see, we are arguing. 
Holmes gets closer and closer to Irene as he presses his case vehemently. 
HOLMES When a man you ask me to find ends up dead in the coffin of the most notorious murderer since Jack the Ripper and that murderer manages to return from the dead, not only is it my business, it's the business of Scotland Yard and the highest levels of the British government. They will certainly consider your reticence to be an obstruction of justice. Which in relation to a crime of this magnitude would certainly mean prison time. 
IRENE This wine is excellent.    You should really try some. 
Holmes notices her Derringer on the table next to the wine bottle. 
HOLMES So what's it to be? 
IRENE Do we really have to decide now? 
Irene reaches for the wine. 
HOLMES You're in over your head this time, Irene. 
Irene snatches up her gun.    Holmes grabs her arm. 
BANG! A BULLET tears into his shoe, missing his toe. Holmes snatches away the smoking Derringer. Irene kisses him, hard and angry at first, becoming something else. Another of the weapons in her arsenal, and the one that disarms Holmes. 
The kiss leads them to the bed.

75   CONTINUED: (3)                                                 75 IRENE That's better. 
Irene pulls him down to it.     He doesn't resist. 
CLICK! 
Holmes' eyes flare with surprise. 
CLICK! 
IRENE Much better. 
Irene has handcuffed him to the bed frame. 
IRENE This is the only way it could ever work between us, Sherlock -- one in shackles, the other with the key. 
She gets off him. 
While he struggles on the bed, Irene walks casually across the room. She starts putting on MAN'S CLOTHING. She's in charge now. 
IRENE I've NEVER been in over my head. 
HOLMES How can you live like this -- always a fugitive. 
She approaches, now dressed as a man, straddles him. 
IRENE But free. And on my own terms. Just like you -- well, not you at this exact moment -- 
(CONTINUED) 
75    CONTINUED: (4)                                               75 She pulls at the front of his trousers, throws the handcuff keys down there. 
IRENE -- but generally speaking. 
Holmes has no retort. Irene takes the scarf off his neck, moves to the doorway. 
IRENE If anyone asks, please let them know that Mr. O'Neil didn't have time to check out. (beat) I hope you don't mind settling the bill. 
OR ALT: 
IRENE What were you doing consorting with a married business traveller in his hotel room is something you'll have to explain for yourself.

PERIGRINE Good evening, sir. Some figs and honey with a nice glass of port? I've prepared a tray.

84    EXT. QUEENSHITHE SLAUGHTERHOUSE - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT         84 
An industrial area on a bend of the Thames. Work doesn't stop when the sun goes down. Wharves stretch out into the water. WE SEE a boat is being loaded. We PULL BACK FROM the scene and look ACROSS the water. 
Just above the thump of industry we can hear a distinctive and irregular CHUGGING sound. Slowly a decrepit and eccentric little steam launch chugs INTO VIEW. Holmes is on the deck along with a much older man in a sailor's hat -- CAPTAIN TANNER. 
HOLMES Everything all right, Captain Tanner? 
Captain Tanner has few teeth and a large white beard. 
TANNER Just a little leak, nothing to worry about. 
Watson is busy with a bucket clearing the boat of a very serious leak. He's soaked, and furious. 
TANNER Not a great one for the water, are you, doctor? Army type, aren't you? You wouldn't have lasted long in the Navy. 
Watson glares. Holmes scans the banks with a telescope. He sees a jetty with a few shadows shifting on it. The engine shudders off, the boat drifts. Tanner whispers: 
TANNER That's as far as we can go. 
Holmes starts clambering over the side.    Watson's pissed. 
WATSON There must be fifty yards of mud out there. 
Holmes' head is just visible before he drops over the prow. He whispers at Tanner.

Tanner nods. A soft "splosh" as Holmes disappears. Watson carefully leaves his valued possessions behind, watch, etc. He lays down his wallet and looks at Tanner. 
WATSON I know precisely how much money is in there. 
TANNER (taking the piss) I am sure you do, doctor. 
Watson glares, goes over the side, with his walking stick.

86   EXT. QUEENSHITHE SLAUGHTERHOUSE                              86 
Holmes and Watson emerge out of the shallows, covered in mud. Holmes doesn't seem bothered. Watson does. 
They look up and see a jetty that heads out into the river. Two shadowy THUGS guard the dock, while more THUGS are loading the boat with something. 
Holmes and Watson scuttle forward, towards the entrance, where two more THUGS patrol. Watson pulls out Holmes' GUN. HOLMES What are you doing with my gun? 
WATSON Oh, please. 
HOLMES It was an honest mistake -- 
WATSON There was nothing honest about it. 
Holmes looks back at Watson, takes the gun, says nothing, the closest he'll come to a confession. Watson steps forward. 
WATSON Come on, let's get this over with. 
(CONTINUED) 
86   CONTINUED:                                                    86 They look out at the thugs guarding the door. Holmes whispers, trying to figure out the best strategy. 
HOLMES The one on the left seems more attentive, might prove easily distracted. The big one's been drinking -- whether for courage or from habit... Watson? 
Watson has already left. He simply walks up to the door and whacks the larger man in the face with the gun -- before dispatching the other with a backhand pistol-whip. 
Holmes follows, notices that both men have hip flasks. He picks one up, takes a whiff, and pockets it as he follows Watson. He slows, sensing something behind him. He turns, looks at shadows. Nothing. And he enters --

89   INT. QUEENSHITHE SLAUGHTERHOUSE - ANTECHAMBER                 89 
Shadows on shadows. Metal groans softly, like a plaintive wail. The twisted blades of slaughterhouse instruments glimmer in the darkness. A few RATS lay dead. A truly creepy scene. Holmes and Watson move through it. 
As they go, Holmes notices rows of empty tables. He runs his finger through a layer of dust, inspecting it. Quiet: 
HOLMES They cleared something out of here, not minutes ago... 
Holmes slows, picks up one of the dead rats. He inspects it, sees something on its skin, some kind of dark spore. 
WATSON (O.S.) Holmes.   You need to see this. 
Holmes looks up, and sees Watson standing at a set of doors.

89   CONTINUED:                                                     89 Holmes pulls out a CIGAR-CUTTER, CLIPS off the rat's TAIL, slipping it into his pocket, as he joins Watson, stepping into -- 
90   INT. QUEENSHITHE SLAUGHTERHOUSE - FACTORY FLOOR                90 
A massive space with a maze of machinery full of deadly gears and blades and saws, lifeless and silent for now. An automated butchery on a grand scale. This is the killing floor. Huge hooks hang from chain belts on an I- beam, the ceiling, swaying softly, whispering in the wind. 
On the high walls, a huge number has been scrawled:     118. 
WATSON One-eighteen.    It's a date, a time? 
Holmes shakes his head, his eyes narrow, ticking. 
HOLMES It's chapter and verse. Revelation 1:18. `I am He that liveth, and was dead.' 
Another voice completes the passage, echoing from above: 
BLACKWOOD (O.S.) `And behold, I am alive forevermore, and have the keys of hell and of death. Amen.' 
90A   CONTINUED: (3)                                              90A -- and Watson catches her feet, pulls her horizontal, facing the other way just in time to avoid the gush of boiling water. 
As Watson holds Irene, he spots a small, but significant- looking SWITCH on the wall, painted red. (PLEASE NOTE, NEW PROP!) 
Watson helps Irene back onto the conveyor belt, leaves her for Holmes to deal with, sprints for the switch. 
Irene rides the belt upwards.   Holmes clambers the equipment, following her. 
Up ahead, the scorched, scalded pig carcass precedes them. 
Holmes darts through a trimming station, with CLEAVERS HANGING FROM CHAINS, grabs one, jumps onto the belt, catches up to Irene -- 
-- just as they both see the pig carcass CUT IN HALF LENGTHWAYS BY A GIANT BANDSAW. 
Holmes wastes no time, swings the meat cleaver at the lock shackling Irene's left hand. Sparks fly as metal kisses metal, but that's all. She's still shackled. 
Then both of them see that Watson has reached the SWITCH. Whew! 
Watson looks at them with relief -- close one -- and pulls the switch down with a really satisfying CLUNK! 
A bank of lights goes out but the conveyor belt keeps moving towards the giant band saw. 
Shit a brick. 
IRENE Sherlock? 
Now, she's showing nerves. So is Sherlock. He braces himself on the belt, swings the cleaver with all his might -- 
-- smashes the shackle lock. 
Irene swings sideways violently, still shackled by her right hand. 
The bandsaw whines viciously. 
Irene swings aside, just misses it.

80A. 90A   CONTINUED: (4)                                             90A Gets a free haircut. 
Then Holmes is under her, lifting her high so that she can free her right hand (a move not possible with both shackles). 
Irene unhooks herself, falls forward, taking Holmes with her. They plummet downwards OUT OF FRAME. 
Watson sprints towards where they fell, looks down --

Watson shakes his head, turns, heads for the door, looking for Blackwood. 
Irene gives Holmes a sweet, grateful smile -- 
IRENE Thank you so much. I owe you. 
-- pulls a knife, gets up, heads after Watson.    Holmes grabs her, stops her. 
HOLMES You owe me information. (angry) No more games, Irene. 
She hears Watson opening the door to the dock. She looks at Holmes, their eyes locking. Finally, the truth: 
IRENE Blackwood's manufactured large- scale weapons for years. Lately there've been rumors of something new. More powerful than anything else. And... magical. My job is to find out if the rumors are true. (MORE)

And she's off, running toward the door. Holmes trails her, processing. They blast through the doors to -- 
91    EXT. NINE ELMS JETTY                                            91 
Watson runs out of doors and towards the end of the dock. He sees: Blackwood and the boat are disappearing into the darkness. 
Holmes and Irene run out of the doors following Watson. Holmes slows, looking around the dock, seeing something on the planks: 
Steel drums are dripping.    A chemical.   Holmes recognizes it. 
HOLMES Watson! 
Watson continues down the dock, tripping a wire connected to the steel drums, he turns realizing he has set off a trap and turns back to warn the others -- 
WATSON Holmes... 
A metallic conductor SPARKS.    Time slows.   BOOM! 
The drums of chemicals all EXPLODE! A blinding conflagration engulfing Watson. For a moment, it lights up all of London. 
HOLMES WAATTTSSSSSONNN!!!! 
Holmes is pushed back   by the explosion as the rest of the barrels that line the   dock begin exploding arond them -- it looks as it Watson   hasn't survived. BOOM! Irene is knocked to the ground   by the blasts and flying debris. 
Holmes races towards her as more explosions, flames and debris fly all around him in slow motion, occasionally knocking him to the ground. 
He reaches Irene, picks her up and grabs part of an exploded barrel to shield the two as they run for cover -- BOOM! The barrel splinters as a final blast knocks them down, but to safety. 
As he opens his eyes --

91   CONTINUED:                                                  91 We see Lestrade and his men swarming the scene, they spot Watson, alive, but unconscious. Irene has disappeared. Holmes sees this and heads toward his friend, but -- 
-- is intercepted by Constable Clark. 
CONSTABLE CLARK There's an order for your arrest all the way from the top, sir -- so you'll have to hit me now. 
HOLMES From Lord Coward? 
CONSTABLE CLARK Yes, sir, so make it look good. 
-- but not obscuring the light of instability in his eyes. They begin to overflow with tears. He brushes them away then looks at his wet hand, horrified.

95     INT. PUNCH BOWL PUB - ATTIC                                   95 
Holmes enters, disturbed, pained.   Emotions swirling. 
He pulls out a newspaper with the story of Standish's death, the pages and strange sacrificial offerings (bone, hair, feather, fang) from Sir Thomas' house. 
Gathering himself, Holmes stands in the middle of the bare room and starts to lay out the clues he has on the floor. The Ox bone directly in front of him (at 12 o'clock). The eagle feather to his right (at 3 o'clock). The human hair behind him (at 6 o'clock) and the Lion's fang to his left (at 9 o'clock). 
Then with a piece of charcoal Holmes draws a circle around each image and a circle directly in the center of the four other circles. He then draws lines which join the circles together in the shape of a cross. 
In the center circle he draws a pentagram (using wax from a burning candle?). Then he pours a ring of salt around that circle. 
He lights four candles (one at each point of the cross) then stands in the center of the circle. 
He pulls a pocket knife from his coat, opens the blade, cuts his thumb and allows the drops of blood to drip onto the ground just outside the circle. (CONTINUED) 
85A. 95   CONTINUED:                                                    95 Then he begins to chant. The words are eerily reminiscent of Blackwood's chanting. 
Suddenly one of the drops of blood bursts into flame in mid-air -- as it hits the ground, the circle around Holmes ignites, followed by a larger circle beyond that. 
BLACKWOOD (O.S.) And now it dawns on you, you begin to recognize your part in his play. 
Holmes snaps around, Blackwood has appeared behind him within the outer circle of flame. 
BLACKWOOD You see the path he chose for you. 
Holmes sways, fuzzy.   He struggles to focus on Blackwood. 
(CONTINUED) 
95   CONTINUED: (2)                                                 95 BLACKWOOD Didn't you wonder why it was so easy to catch me? I told you I needed five lives for my resurrection. Why would I take a sixth under St. Paul's? 
Holmes shakes his head, he can barely see straight. 
BLACKWOOD Unless I simply wanted to be caught by the great Sherlock Holmes... 
Blackwood raises a sacrificial sword and swings at Holmes' head. 
BLACKWOOD ... so I could die on the biggest stage of all. You made me what I am. 
We see -- 
HOLMES' POV 
as Blackwood swings the sacrificial sword at Holmes' head. It looks as if Holmes has no time to react -- 
WHOOSH -- the sword WIPES the FRAME --

We see a SERIES OF QUICK CUTS, has Blackwood killed Holmes, or is he hallucinating, caught in the spell he conjured?

A CLOSEUP OF HOLMES 
His face covered with earth -- just as we saw Reordon in his coffin. Holmes' eyes snap open, he breathes in air --

CUT TO: 
HOLMES 
Writing and sweating on the bed in the attic. Holmes sees a hazy image of Irene. She leans over him smiling sweetly then wraps her hands around his neck and starts to strangle him. 
IRENE SAYING "WHERE'S WATSON WHEN YOU NEED HIM?" 
BLACKWOOD IN THE ROOM AGAIN WITHIN THE FLAME CIRCLE. 
Then he moves to a Lion fang. He sketches out a lion -- he thinks -- BUT no flashes. Next to it he writes a big question mark. Where? Who? 
Holmes returns to his violin. Staring at the Lion fang as if willing the flashes to come. 
INT. PUNCH BOWL PUB The music stops. Irene and Watson notice the silence. They swap a glance. A beat. And Holmes emerges. 
HOLMES I need a map of London. 
102   INT. PUNCH BOWL PUB - ATTIC                                   102 
Holmes is excited, electric. 
HOLMES Now that you're sitting comfortably, I shall begin. My initial approach was far too narrow. When Blackwood invited me to Pentonville prison, he suggested I widen my gaze and, at minimum, I have done just that. In fact, I may well have reconciled thousands of years of theological disparity. But that's for another time. Blackwood's method is based on a ritualistic mystical system that has been employed by The Temple of the Four Orders for centuries. To fully understand this system, to get inside it, I re-enacted the ceremony we interrupted in the crypt... with a few enhancements of my own. 
WATSON At minimum. 
Watson and Irene shoot Holmes knowing looks. 
HOLMES My journey took me somewhat further down the rabbit hole than I had intended. 
IRENE Yes, your little white tail got rather dirty. 
HOLMES But I have emerged enlightened... The fraternity who silently control the Empire, share the belief with the Kings, Pharoahs, and Emperors of old that the Sphinx was a door to another dimension, a gateway to immeasurable power -- 
He tosses Watson the pages from Sir Thomas. 
HOLMES It is made up of four parts: The Ox, the Lion, the Eagle, and Man -- (CONTINUED) 
90A. 102   CONTINUED:                                                 102 He points out the individual parts of the Sphinx, covering other parts with his hand. We see the Ox body, Lion paws, Eagle wings, Man's face. 
HOLMES In Sir Thomas' secret chamber I found the bone of an ox, the tooth of a lion, the feather of an eagle, the hair of a man. Map! 
Watson throws the map down on the floor, really flying now. 
HOLMES Now, it is a widely held belief that within the architecture of the great cities are coded references to this system. 
He runs his finger over the map tracing the shape of a cross... 
Then he picks up the charcoal and (following the map) draws a serpentine curve of the River Thames straight through the middle of the cross that he drew on the floor. 
HOLMES Since he rose from the grave, Blackwood has killed three men. Each murder was committed at a location that has a direct connection with the Temple, therefore the System. (beat) Reordon, the ginger midget, represents Man. We found his body here... 
He points to a spot on the map south of the Thames. It corresponds to the point on the cross that Holmes drew that has the hair (6 o'clock). 
HOLMES Then Sir Thomas, Master of the Temple, wore the ox ring... he died here... 
Again the spot Holmes points is directly north of the river and corresponds to the point on the cross that has the ox bone (12 o'clock). 
(CONTINUED) 
90B. 102   CONTINUED: (2)                                              102 HOLMES Standish was Ambassador to America, where the Eagle has been the national emblem for over a hundred years -- and not by coincidence. 
Holmes points to the map. 
HOLMES The headquarters of Temple of the Four Orders where he died is here... 
He points to corresponding points on the map and on the cross. 
WATSON Man, Ox, Eagle... 
He connects the dots on the map.   They form three points of a cross. 
WATSON And last on the list:    the Lion. Holmes scribbles on a piece of paper. Watson and Irene step closer looking at the lion's fang and then the map... 
HOLMES Correspondingly, the map will tell us the location of Blackwood's final act. Right here. 
Their eyes widen as they realize what they're seeing. WATSON Parliament. 
IRENE What is the meaning of this circle? 
Irene indicates the fifth circle Holmes has drawn -- the point at which the other four come together. They look to where it would correspond to on the map -- right in the middle of the river. 
HOLMES It is the fifth element -- the ethereal. That which can't yet be known.

BOOM! They hear doors slamming outside, boots echoing. Irene looks out the window, sees POLICE OFFICERS flooding the pub. 
IRENE Police. 
Holmes folds up his piece of paper, hands it to Watson. He quickly moves to a hatch in the floor. Flings it open. 
HOLMES Ladies first. 
Irene jumps down.   Watson is about to follow her down. 
HOLMES Follow these plans. 
Watson goes down. It looks as though Holmes is about to join them when Lestrade and his men burst into the room. Holmes kicks the hatch closed and steps towards Lestrade.

103    INT. POLICE CARRIAGE - MID-MORNING (LATER)                   103 
Holmes sits battered, cuffed and bruised, though we can see from his face that his spirits are unaffected by his physical state. Tough-looking cops sit either side of him, Lestrade sits opposite, shaking his head -- he can't believe it's come to this. He looks at Holmes.

Tanner smiles, still pleased with himself. 
IRENE Where to, Sherlock? 
Holmes points to a dark recess in the embankment. 
HOLMES Port side, Captain Tanner, into the sewers. 
Tanner turns the boat.   Irene looks out, her eyes narrow. 
HOLMES Watson, did you bring my clothes? 
Watson hands over a pile of clothes and Holmes' PISTOL. Holmes opens the drum, checks the load, grimaces, pockets it. He's never going to like guns.

IRENE Starting early, aren't we? 
He offers the flask to her. 
HOLMES Trust me, have a drink. 
She can see this is more than a social invitation, she takes a hit, pulls a face. Holmes nods towards Watson, Irene passes him the bottle. He drinks, grimaces, hands it on to Tanner, who swallows it without flinching, wipes his mouth, smiles. The boat is almost at the sewers. 
WATSON What are we doing in the sewers? 
HOLMES Patience, Doctor. I am about to show you... 
As they head toward the sewers, Holmes glances up toward Big Ben, the time moving toward noon.

Tanner's boat, unlit, floats at the opening to the tunnel, on the edge of the darkness. 
TANNER Far as I can go. 
Holmes and Watson leap off the boat into the mouth of the sewer. Irene follows. (Watson has his SWORD STICK and a GUN, Holmes has changed into the clothes Watson brought for him.) 
They move through the shadowy sewer tunnels, working their way around corners and through junctions back under the Houses of Parliament. (CONTINUED)

The area where Coward and Blackwood were seen in the flashback ceremony with the sword. But now: 
Blackwood's THUGS patrol the area. In the center, the pentagram remains. But there is something sitting in it, a futuristic device: 
HOLMES Behold, Blackwood's magic. 
A black glass cylinder is housed in a metal cradle with electrodes on either side. It sits below a shattered ceiling, bricks dismantled, exposing a VENTILATION PIPE. Holmes looks back at Watson and Irene. Quiet: 
HOLMES A chemical weapon. The first of its kind. Cyanide, to be precise. 
WATSON You can tell that from here? 
HOLMES No.   I can tell it from here. He pulls something out of his pocket:    the RAT TAIL. 
HOLMES I snipped this off a rather recumbent rat at the slaughterhouse. Note the blue discoloration, the faint smell of bitter almonds. Tell-tale signs of cyanide. 
He points at the device and the exposed shaft over it. 
HOLMES That shaft leads directly to Parliament. When activated, those electrodes on either side will send a charge converting the cyanide powder into a gas. 
IRENE All of the people inside that building -- 
WATSON Will be dead at the strike of noon. (CONTINUED) 
110    CONTINUED: (2)                                               110 HOLMES As if by magic. There will be no one left to stop Blackwood and his followers from assuming control.

Holmes checks his watch. 
HOLMES Seven minutes to twelve... 
They nod. Shoulder-to-shoulder, they move down the tunnel, faster and faster. 
Irene trails them closely. 
Watson slides his sword stick into a loop on his belt. It's there when he needs it, out of the way otherwise. 
They draw their guns. They burst into the area, completely surprising the three thugs. 
Watson pistol-whips the nearest.    Holmes front-kicks the next. 
The third thug looks down the barrels of both their guns before he has a chance to fight or flee. 
HOLMES I wouldn't. 
He doesn't. Irene comes in behind them and heads straight for the device. 
WATSON I'll keep these under wraps.

Blackwood has lit four small red candles, placed them on the balustrade in front of him. He calmly intones a familiar chant. Lords are on their feet. Guards are banging outside the doors, but the doors are locked. Members of the Temple of Four Orders stand in front of anyone going to open them. 
INT. SEWER TUNNEL - DAY Holmes rips the stem off his pipe, places the open end of the bowl against the bolt holding the cylinders in place. Shaped charge, Victorian-style. 
HOLMES We need a light, a match -- 
Irene's eyes narrow, seeing something in the cradle:   her KNIFE. She rolls up a sleeve. 
IRENE Got it... Which is when a blood-maddened Dredger thunders into them both, arms wide, driving Holmes and Irene away from the device -- 
-- hammering them into the wall with a mighty thud. Then he braces his massive feet, angles his huge legs and pushes, squeezes them against the wall like a human vice. 
That's the extent of Dredger's plan, and it will work for long enough because --

The batteries begin to fizz madly, cams turn, gears ratchet past each other. Bad news. 
WATSON (O.S.) Hey! 
Dredger turns his head so that he can see Watson, on his belly, crawled from the sewer -- where he found HOLMES' GUN. 
BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! Four white phosphorous tracers strobe through the sewer, stitch a line down Dredger's back (aimed so as not to hit Holmes or Irene on the through-and-through) -- 
-- and continue to burn inside Dredger. He lurches away, eyes bulging, mouth wide with a silent scream. 
BONG! 
IRENE Two! 
Holmes and Irene stagger for the device. 
Fizzling, boiling inside, the dying giant falls like a tree. 
Watson is face-down on the stones, still.   The gun falls out of his limp hand. 
Irene swipes her hand down into the cradle, just barely avoiding the sparks and coils, snatching her blade, and... 
ZAP! A spark hits the blade, and she angles the blade, redirecting the spark toward -- 
Holmes' pipe, which BLOWS WITH A VICIOUS CRACK!   The shaped charge shears the steel rods. 
Holmes and Irene reach for the cylinders.

I see before me a conspiracy of arrogant old men puffed up by the illusion of their own vainglory. In your hands this once great parliament has become nothing more than a drunken satyr, stumbling about the world's stage seeking nothing more than to satiate your own lust and gluttony; your britches stained by the incontinence of your hypocrisy. I will not sit idly by and watch you violate the innocence of the public trust as you drag this great Empire into the quagmire that your pride has dug and filled with the excrement of your corruption. I am here to change all this. 
He raises his hand and traces a circle in the air.   A circle of flame erupts on the opposite wall. 
BLACKWOOD I am the fourth horseman. 
He raises his hand and traces a triangle in the air.     A triangle of flame erupts on the opposite wall. 
BLACKWOOD I am the pale rider. 
He raises his hand and traces a second triangle in the air. The second triangle of flame erupts on the opposite wall to complete the pentagram within the circle. 
BLACKWOOD And my name to you is death.

Nothing happens. Nothing at all. They look around. Everyone is still standing. Coward looks confused, scared. Other Temple members eye him.

HOLMES Why hurry off, give it a try. 
He moves in again.   She shoots him in the arm. 
And in that split second -- 
Blackwood drops down from behind Irene, HITS her with WATSON'S SWORD STICK. She drops, stunned. As she falls, Blackwood plucks the cylinder out of her hand, and kicks her gun away. Her gun goes flying off the side of the bridge. But Irene doesn't pause: 
She swings her legs through the air, trying to take out Blackwood's knees. But he swipes her legs away, and KICKS DOWN and --

119H   CONTINUED: (2)                                             119H EXT. TOWER BRIDGE - WALKWAY - DAY 
A look between them and then it's on. Holmes grabs a short section of wooden batten out of the railing. Flimsy, no match for the sword -- 
-- which is immediately apparent as Blackwood comes in, slashes, chops six inches off the batten. 
BLACKWOOD I planned to kill a handful of senile old men to make this empire strong... but now because of you thousands are going to die. 
Holmes is on the defensive throughout, but, as before, his target is the cylinder first, Blackwood second, self defense third. 
BLACKWOOD All I have to do is break this cylinder. The wind will do the rest. And you'll be the first. 
The two men continue their swordfight: Holmes grabs some rope hanging from the scaffolding above and swings off the bridge. Blackwood steps to the edge with his sword out, awaiting Holmes. Holmes swings towards the blade and then pushes off the bridge once again to avoid it. 
Holmes swings back onto the bridge a few feet away from Blackwood. He lands, whips off his scarf and twirls it around Blackwood's arm, binding them together. They continue to spar, now bound. 
Blackwood snarls, mounts a frenzied attack, which Holmes simply tries to survive. The two men finally part, with Holmes cast off towards the end of the bridge. 
Blackwood smiles. He grabs Holmes' gun (which Blackwood knocked from Irene's hand earlier). 
Blackwood fires at Holmes. Holmes quickly ducks. The bullet misses him, but hits a bucket twirling above his head. A black liquid (tar) begins to pour out in a circle around him. 
Holmes turns, as if to flee (not that there's anywhere to go) -- his eyes lock on to something. He looks back to Blackwood. 
-- Holmes kicks a huge scaffolding plank, which falls -- 
-- whipping a coil of rope across the floor, hooking Blackwood around his ankle. (CONTINUED) 
110A. 119H   CONTINUED: (3)                                            119H Blackwood is DRAGGED down the walkway by the weight of the falling plank, pulled toward the edge. 
Holmes grabs the cylinders as Blackwood passes. 
Blackwood digs his fingers into a gap, screeching to a painful halt. His fingers are white from strain. Holmes remains cool. 
HOLMES There was never any magic.   Only conjuring tricks. 
Above Holmes:   the raven starts PECKING at a rope. 
HOLMES The simplest involved paying people off, like the prison guard... 
Holmes looks over the edge of the walkway. He sees the plank swinging dangerously in the storm. Blackwood strains desperately to hold on. As Holmes steps closer we INTERCUT with relevant FLASHBACKS. 
HOLMES (guard choking/ payoff) Who pretended to be possessed outside your cell. Your reputation and your jailers' fear did the rest. (burial ground/ licking rocks) Others required more elaborate preparation, like the sandstone slab that covered your tomb. You had it broken before your burial then put back together using a mild adhesive. An ancient Egyptian recipe I believe -- a mixture of egg and honey. Designed to be washed away by the rain or eaten by animals. (bath/Reordon flashback) Arranging for your father to drown in his own bathtub required more modern science. Very clever of Reordon to find a paralytic that was activated by the combination of copper and water and was therefore undetectable once the bath water was drained. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
110B. 119H   CONTINUED: (4)                                           119H HOLMES (CONT'D) That might have been quite challenging had he not also tested it on some unfortunate amphibians. (Standish in rain/ pulling the trigger/ wharf explosion) The death of Standish was a real mystery, until you used the same compound to blow up the wharf. An odorless, tasteless, flammable liquid -- yet it burned with an unusual pinkish hue. Did Standish mistake it for rain as he entered your Temple? All it took was a spark. A simple rigged bullet in his gun. Ingenious. (Parliament/flask/ ceremony, dev ice) Like all great performers you saved your piece de resistance for the end. Had it worked, your followers in Parliament would have watched unharmed as their colleagues were dying around them. They didn't know that you had given them the antidote -- at one of your ceremonies I suspect. Instead, they would have believed it was magic and that you harnessed the ultimate power. 
END FLASHBACKS.

119H   CONTINUED: (5)                                            119H Blackwood struggles to hold on, he loses his grip for a second and is dragged back toward the precipice. Wind whips harder. 
Holmes doesn't notice: The Raven's rope SNAPS, starting a slow, subtle DOMINO EFFECT IN B.G.: a bucket drops, hits a row of standing timbers. The timbers start to topple. 
(NOTE: Each time one object strikes another, we hear a faint musical note moving up the same pentatonic scale that Holmes played earlier for his flies.) 
HOLMES You hated your father and the other members of the Temple of the Four Orders for what they did to you. How satisfying it must have been to use their own system against them. 
IN B.G.: We see the slow, inexorable dominoes continue to fall. The last timber falls over the edge, lands on a rope. The rope yanks down a crane, the crane swings, strikes another crane... 
BLACKWOOD Cut me loose, Holmes! 
Blackwood's eyes are full of fear. Holmes thoughtfully looks out at the angry storm, the atmosphere electric and dangerous. Holmes gives the slightest hint of a smile. 
MARY What's in all those notebooks? 
WATSON Nothing really... Just a few scribbles... cases we've worked on over the years. 
MARY All your adventures... I'd love to read them sometime. 
Watson laughs then pauses for a moment to consider this idea before they enter. 
123A                                                               123A INT. 221 BAKER ST. - STAIRCASE As Watson and Mary climb the stairs, it becomes clear that Mary now wears IRENE'S DIAMOND on her finger. Holmes had it made into an engagement ring. WATSON I still can't believe he's given us that ring. 
MARY Do you think he's finally come to terms with you leaving? 
WATSON Of course.    No question about it -- 
123B   INT. 221 BAKER ST.                                          123B 
Watson opens the door of Holmes' apartment revealing a horrific scene: Holmes is hanging from a rope, his back to them. He looks dead. 
(CONTINUED) 
114A. 123B   CONTINUED:                                               123B WATSON Don't panic, dear. 
Watson and Mary step in but do nothing to help Holmes. 
WATSON Suicide is not in his repetoire, he's far too fond of himself. 
Watson pokes him.   Turns him around. 
HOLMES Good afternoon. I was trying to deduce the manner in which Blackwood survived his execution. Clearing your good name, as it were. But it had a surprisingly soporific effect and I was carried off in the arms of Morpheus, like a caterpillar in a cocoon. 
WATSON Get on with it, Holmes. 
HOLMES Cleverly concealed in the hangman's knot was a hook -- I believe my legs have fallen asleep. I should probably come down. 
MARY Shouldn't you help him, John? 
WATSON I hate to stop when he's on a roll. Do carry on, Holmes. 
Watson and Mary walk by. 
HOLMES The executioner attached it to a harness, thus allowing the weight to be distributed around the waist and the neck to remain intact. My lord, I can't feel my cheeks. Might we continue this at ground level? 
WATSON How did you manage it, Holmes? 
(CONTINUED) 
123B   CONTINUED: (2)                                            123B HOLMES I managed it with braces, belts and a coat hook. Please, Watson, my tongue is going next. I'll be of no use to you at all. 
WATSON Worse things could happen. 
MARY John. 
Watson draws his sword. 
WATSON But none of this explains the lack of a pulse. 
He finally uses his sword stick and slices Holmes down. Holmes tumbles to the ground. 
HOLMES There is a toxin refined from the nectar of the rhododendron ponticum. It is quite infamous in the region of Turkey bordering the Black Sea for its ability to induce an apparently mortal paralysis. Enough to mislead a medical mind even as tenacious and well-trained as your own. It is known locally as -- 
MARY What's wrong with Gladstone? 
HOLMES -- mad honey disease. 
CLOSEUP OF WATSON'S DOG 
Stiff as a board. 
HOLMES He is demonstrating the very effect I've just described. He doesn't mind. 
WATSON His heart should be ticking in no time. 
(CONTINUED) 
123B   CONTINUED: (3)                                            123B Watson feels for a pulse in his dog's neck -- he shakes his head. They are interrupted by a knock on the door. Constable Clark enters. 
CONSTABLE CLARK Mr. Holmes... Inspector Lestrade asks that you come with me, right away. 
HOLMES What is it this time, Clarky? 
CONSTABLE CLARK It's one of our sergeants, sir. He went missing in the sewers, the day you stopped Lord Blackwood... Well, a maintenance man found his body this morning. We believe the sergeant was our first man on the scene. Shot in the head. 
HOLMES Were there powder burns on his eyebrows? 
Clarky nods. 
CONSTABLE CLARK Yes. 
WATSON Point blank range. 
HOLMES With small caliber bullet. 
CONSTABLE CLARK Indeed. 
HOLMES Moriarty. 
Holmes and Watson look at each other -- complete change of demeanor -- mind racing, looking concerned. 
The dog has regained its vital signs. 
MARY There's a brave boy... There, there, everything's going to be all right. 
WATSON Where is Blackwood's device now? 
(CONTINUED) 
116A. 123B   CONTINUED: (4)                                              123B CONSTABLE CLARK The secret service has it, sir. They've taken over the case.

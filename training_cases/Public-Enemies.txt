TITLE: SEPTEMBER 26, 1933. 
EXT. PRICK STREETS OF MICHIGAN CITY, INDIANA - A BROWN 
PONTIAC is parked at the curb. It waits. 
INT. PONTIAC - "RED" HAMILTON ( 34) 
looks at his watch. With his meticulously parted red hair, he might be a bank president. It's 6:55 a.m. 
HAMILTON Time. Thirty year old JOHN HERBERT DILLINGER is in the backseat. He nods. His arms are behind him. We don't know why. Red starts the car and drives forward. 
CUT TO: 
INT. INDIANA STATE PRISON, MICHIGAN CITY, INDIANA - LINE OF 
CONVICTS Its cold.-Convicts' uniforms are broadly striped and frayed. This is a line of hard men branded by prison: shorn hair, broken nose, eyes with a cold ferocity. And their aggression has a nihilistic edge; their spirits never surrender. There's nothing beaten down about these men. Like Alcatraz, Leavenworth, and Sing Sing, this is the end of the line. 
PRISON GUARDS in visored black caps, black shirts, black patent leather Sam Browne belts with three-foot long billy clubs watch the line, poised to unleash violence. 
AMONG THE HARD MEN ARE... HARRY "PETE" PIERPONT (32), 6 foot 1 with eerie blue eyes. Brilliant, violent, he hates all authority. CHARLES MAKLEY ( 44), squat with an anvil jaw, facial scars and as calm as Pierpont is volatile. HOMER VAN METER (27), tall, an incorrigible clown and an unemotional killer. He has continued to ridicule guards even when it cost him months in the hole. 
THESE THREE with an older man, WALTER DIETRICH, wait for the lam. work call to the prison Shirt Factory... 
INT. INDIANA STATE PRISON, GATEHOUSE - TURNKEY 
watches through a window as a Pontiac pulls into the parking area in front of the prison across from the streetcar tracks. Hamilton jerks a handcuffed Dillinger out of the backseat. Dillinger is shoved forward. Hamilton's wearing a star. 
TURNKEY (opening up) Afternoon. Hamilton flashes the badge. He shoves Dillinger inside. In an adjacent room FIVE GUARDS play poker. Next to them is a barred entrance to the prison yard. As the cage door locks behind him, this is the last place Dillinger wants to have entered. Meanwhile... 
INT. INDIANA STATE PRISON - THE SHIRT FACTORY: STACKS OF 
BOXES and bolts of fabric wait for the convicts. lam. A KLAXON sounds. Door opens. Convicts enter. Walter Dietrich goes right to the stacks and pulls a box with an "X" crayoned on the side. Its labeled "Thread." (Dietrich was mentored by Herbert K. Lamm, an ex-Prussian soldier who invented professional bank robbery by applying military tactics and who rode with Butch & Sundanc4's Hole in the Wall Gang in Utah in 1901. in prison Dietrich passed on Lamm's techniques. His brightest student in 1933 is..'ohn Herbert Dillinger.) 
DIETRICH + "THREAD" BOX arrive at a busy work station with Pierpont, Makley and Van Meter. Under spools are four Colt 45 automatics with loaded magazines. 
GUARD DAINARD is approached by Pierpont, who shoves the 45 in his face. 
PIERPONT Line up! Line up... Dietrich and Van Meter control THREE OTHER GUARDS. ED SHOUSE, JIM LESLIE and EARL ADAMS - three other Cons armed with makeshift clubs and spivs -- join the escape. Meanwhile... 
INT. GATEHOUSE - TURNKEY 
examines Dillinger a second time... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
TURNKEY Didn't you get paroled out of here a few months ago? 
DILLINGER Yes, sir. Three months ago. 
TURNKEY . John... Johnnie Dillinger? 
DILLINGER That's right. But my friends call me "Johnnie". You gotta address me as "Mister" Dillinger. Dillinger's insubordination puzzles Turnkey so he doesn't see Hamilton bat a Thompson submachine gun across the back of his head and swing it onto the Two Guards... 
RED/DILLINGER Against the wall! Hands up! Get up! Dillinger's cuffs fell away. Now his Thompson covers the stunned pokerÂ°players. Hamilton and Dillinger are as tight as they come.- They share their food, money, liquor, ammunition and women. ,.id right now... 
YARD GATE is keyed open by Dainard followed by Pierpont and Makley and the others. Pierpont kicks over the poker table. Escapees throw all the Guards against the wall. 
MAKLEY/VAN METER (to the Guards) Undress. Get undressed! 
DILLINGER at the window checks the escape route to the Pontiac. Its clear. Hamilton conceals his weapon and starts out. Smooth. He crosses the front lawn, the street car tracks. So far, so good... 
INT. GATE HOUSE - GUARDS 
undress. One takes his time. 
SHOUSE Hurry up! C'mon! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: This Guard gives Shouse an insolent look. Shouse slams the Guard's head with a length of steel pipe. Guard goes down. Shouse goes wild and continues to hammer his skull again and again, caving it in. 
PIERPONT Cut it out Shouse! 
DILLINGER (turns from open door) Shouse!I Dainard thinks that once the killing's begun, he will die... So, he grabs for Homer Van Meter's .45. Van Meter SHOOTS Dainard. Dainard's knocked to the floor. Blood pools. A SIREN SCREAMS. 
EXT. FRONT YARD - RED 
caught in the open, turns. He scans the guard towers on the East and West corners. He backs towards his Pontiac. RED'S POV: TOWER GUARDS look into the prison interior where the shots came from. 
DILLINGER arrives, takes Red's position. Red goes for the Pon,.c... 
HAMILTON Kid didn't fool with anything, did he? Dillinger, looking back at the boy, hasn't heard. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
HAMILTON (CONT'D) Johnnie? All there? Dillinger lifts the coats on the backseat: their weapons are as they were. 
DILLINGER Its all here. 
(UPBEAT) Let's go make some money. The speeding cars throw up tails of dust as they drive west to Chicago. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. THICK WOODS NEAR EAST LIVERPOOL, OHIO - A MAN - DAY 
moves quickly through the woods. They run downhill. He wears expensive hunting clothes. He carries an 8mm Mauser sports rifle with a slim forestock and wrist and a turned-down bolt handle. It's the best rifle made in 1933. 
HE IS MELVIN PURVIS (30) cleancut and handsome. A square jaw. Chester Gould modelled Dick Tracy's profile after Purvis. Has not big, but he's tenacious. He's an incarnation of the social elite of h.is time: white, Southern patrician and a Christian gentleman. With Purvis are Special Agents WARREN BARTON (31) and Purvis's friend CARTER DAUM (29) They have a harder time in the steep woods. They're chasing someone. They are guided by East Liverpool police chief, 
FULTZ. 
BOTTOM OF THE HILL -- PRETTY BOY FLOYD ( 29) is a big-boned country boy. His blue suit is mud-streaked from his slide down the hill. He carries a Thompson submachine-gun with a drum magazine, and he is running for his life. 
PURV I S , FULTZ, BAUM + BARTON race after him. 
MUDDY PATH - FLOYD half runs, half slips in his dress shoes. Ahead is a cleared orchard. Floyd leaps the fence... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
WOODS -- PURVIS jumping over fallen trees... 
EXT. MIDDLE OF THE ORCHARD 
of apple trees. Floyd's three hundred yards ahead. He zigzags for a deeper forest at the far end. If he can reach it, he has a chance. 
PURVIS breaks into the clear. 
PURVIS Floyd! Halt! Purvis aims the Mauser. Perfect form. Floyd zigzags. Purvis FIRES, misses. Floyd opens up with the Thompson -- wildly at that range. A few .45s splinter nearby branches. Fultz, Baum and Barton seek cover: Purvis works the bolt and chambers another round. Floyd is 10 yards from the forest. Purvis kneels onto his right knee. On his upraised left knee he braces hi left elbow. He inhales. Starts a smooth squeeze. Ha Tway through the exhale he FIRES. Floyd's right arm flies up. He's punched forward and crashes to the ground. 
FLOYD regains consciousness. Purvis is running in. Floyd`s left hand pulls a 45. 
BAUM Look out, Melvin! Purvis kicks the 45 out of his hand. 
PURVIS You are under arrest. Floyd sits up to see the massive exit wound. His right lung and liver are shot through. He falls back. 
FLOYD 
(RASPS) I'm Floyd. Who are you? 
PURVIS Melvin Purvis - Department of Investigation. 
(MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
PURVIS (CONT'D) 
(BEAT) Where's your friend Harry Campbell, Floyd? 
FLOYD Ain't gonna tell you shit. Floyd looks at the sky. 
FLOYD (CONT'D) And I believe you have killed me. So you can go and rot in hell, you sonofabitch. He lapses, goes cold and dies. 
CUT TO: 
INT. KITCHEN - CA-ROLE SLAYMAN - DAY (EAST CHICAGO, INDIANA) 
CAROLE SLAYMAN is 33 with green eyes and peroxide blonde hair and bounces down the stairs in a black robe. She crosses through a white kitchen with TWO GIRLS in kimonos. A scarred, African-American bouncer of 50 named SPORT enters... 
SPORT He jus' pulled in. 
EXT. REAR YARD - CAROLE 
sees Dillinger's Pontiac stop in the backyard. It's`-secluded by a hedge from the street. Its followed by the Plymouth with Pierpont and Van Meter in suits and prison haircuts. 
CAROLE Johnny! Dillinger cradles the Thompson in his arm and crosses to her. 
DILLINGER (to Hamilton) Hey, Red, call Oscar. 
HAMILTON Okay. And Berman? Wanna switch-out the "shorts"? 
DILLINGER 
(ADDS) Get a Chrysler and an Essex. (to Carole) Hey, doll... He half picks her up with one arm around her waist. 
(CONTINUED) 
MCKELLAR With no field experience. For once Hoover is silent. 
MCKELLAR (CONT'D) 
(CONTINUING) In fact you are shockingly unqualified, aren't you, sir? You have never personally conducted a criminal investigation in the field in your life= Others in the room stare at Hoover. McKellar leans'-back... 
MCKELLAR (CONT Â° D ) 
(CONTINUING) I think you are a front. I think your prowess as a lawman is a myth created from a hoopla of headlines by Mr. Suydam, your publicist there. You are trying to make a federal police force with you set up as its Czar. That is runnin' wild in my estimation... 
HOOVER Crime is what runs wild in this country, Mr. Chairman. And... 
MCKELLAR And if the country required an expanded Bureau, I question you are the person most fit to run it while... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
HOOVER 
(EXPLODES) I won't be judged by a kangaroo court of venal politicians... 
MCKELLAR (slams gavel!) While outlaws like Dillinger, Clyde Barrow, the Barkers, and Nelson flourish unabated. 
(SLAM) Your appropriation request is denied. The hearing's over. 
TNT. U.S. CONGRESS, CORRIDOR - J. EDGAR HOOVER -DAY walks fast through the corridor of congressmen. He talks over his left shoulder to Suydam and Tolson. They struggle to hear him... 
HOOVER (to Suydam) Find out: was he soft on the Reds in ,1919? Does he use prostitutes? Peppy `tuf f like that. And feed this to Walter =!riiâinchell: "McKellar's a Neanderthal. He's O7:a personal vendetta to destroy me." Like that. 
(BEAT) We'll fight him on the front page. Not in his damn committee room... (to Tolson) Where's Dillinger? 
TOLSON Spotted in Hammond, Indiana. 
HOOVER How long ago? 
TOLSON Yesterday. Another sighting has him on the Lincoln Highway in Ohio heading towards Cincinnati. 
HOOVER 
(DECIDES) He's in Hammond. Heading to Chicago. 
SUYDAM How do you know? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
HOOVER You can have fun in Chicago. What the hell's there to do in Cincinnati? 
INT. HOOVER'S PRIVATE OFFICE -- HOOVER 
enters. Melvin Purvis has been waiting. He's gestured to follow. 
HOOVER (suddenly brilliant) Agent Purvis, congratulations. 
PURVIS Thank you sir. May I ask why? 
HOOVER Pretty Boy Floyd, for which you have my commendation and personal gratitude. Second, you are, as of this moment, the Special Agent in Charge of the Chicago field office. Your task will be to get John Dillinger. Are you up to it? 
PURVIS Absolutely, sir. Purvis is imbued. Henry Suydam enters. 
SUYDAM (to Hoover) They're ready for him. 
HOOVER 
(PENSIVE) This is Henry Suydam.. He is our expert in congressional and press relations. INT. BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION w HOOVER ESCORTS PURVIS THROUGH 
THE OPEN PLAN OFFICE Tolson + Suydam follow. It's like the "Corporate Office of the Future" designed by Albrecht Speer. Agents are at grey metal desks dressed identically in dark suits, white shirts, dark ties. No personal effects. The individual is reduced to a component in a gleaming machine. 
EXT. JUSTICE DEPARTMENT STEPS - HOOVER, PURVIS, SUYDAM + 
TOLSON hurry down the staircase. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
HOOVER 
(LOW) Why are you sure you're up to this task, Mr. Purvis? 
PURVIS We have two weapons that cannot be defeated. 
HOOVER What are they? 
PURVIS The Bureau's modern techniques of investigation and your visionary leadership. 
HOOVER You let Mr. Tolson, here, know if you need anything, Melvin, anything at all, 
PURVIS Thank you. 
his gun against the side of the cop's head, moves to the Buick. A large crowd is across the street. 
CITY DETECTIVES pull up in front of Wylie's Hat shop. Dillinger's crew is crossing fast to Red's Buick, as... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
DILLINGER OPENS UP and the Wylie Hat Shop windows blow out. A DETECTIVE with a deer rifle aims. 
VAN METER FIRES past his hostage's head. Detective goes down. The Hostage's eardrum is blown. His ear bleeds. 
DILLINGER SHOOTS UP... City Detectives' car, police car and a few others. 
INT. BUICK - MAKLEY + PIERPONT 
are in. Dillinger and hostages load onto the running board. Pierpont grabs ANNA PATZKE's arm. 
PIERPONT C'mere, honey. Buick's moving faster. Dillinger pulls her onto the running board next--:o Boyard. The Buick roars away. 
INT. BUICK:.- RED 
drives with total concentration. Makley cooly reads the git. 
MAKLEY 2 miles - turn left at the white barn. Right there. Now. 6 miles to the new bridge. Pierpont breaks out the rear window. He throws two five gallon milk jars full of roofing nails out into the road. They scatter. 
TWO POLICE CARS hit the nails, their tires blow. ROUNDS from the Buick finish dissuading them to pursue. 
INT. BUICK - HAMILTON 
approaches the bridge, slows. 
DILLINGER (to Boyard and two of the 
HOSTAGES) Okay. Beat it! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Three hostages jump off. Dillinger pulls Anna Patzke and Weyland inside. 
DILLINGER sees Anna Patzke's shivering from shock and the cold. He puts his coat on her. He plops his hat on her head, too. 
DILLINGER (CONT'D) Something to remember me by. She laughs, nervously, and a little thrilled at being where she is... 
VAN METER 
(OMINOUS) Are we taking `em to the hideout? 
DILLINGER (going along with it That depends. 
VAN METER How 'bout it, honey? Can you cook? 
ANNA PATZKE (not disinterested) Uh. Sure... After a fashion. They start to hoot and laugh. They think this is hÂ±l iiou.s. 
ANNA PATZKE (CONT'D) Well, its true! 
VAN METER When I'm not doing this, I'm a scout for the movies. 
ANNA PATZKE Really? This makes them laugh even harder. 
EXT. THICK WOODS 
Pierpont has brought the hostages to a big tree. 
PIERPONT Face each other. Join hands. Pierpont binds them loosely to the tree. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
WEYLAND We'll freeze. 
DILLINGER You'll worm your way out of that in about ten minutes. Anna looks over at Dellinger. 
DILLINGER (CONT'D) It's okay, doll. You're just gonna be a little late for dinner. Dillinger reaches over, snatches his hat off Anna Patzke's head. He leaves her his coat. 
THE BUICK WORK CAR is abandoned. 
TRACK RIGHT + SEE Dillinger''b Essex and a Ford drive off past fields with snow on both sides. New cars. Flush with cash. Clean. 
CUT TO: INT. CHICAGt7: BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION OFFICES - PURVIS - DAY 
(BANKER' S BUILDING) looks at the gathered agents. New faces. College men. 
WARREN BARTON holds up the coat Dillinger left on Anna Patzke. 
BAUM .manufactured by Freeman & Freeman in St. Louis. We are identifying all stores that sold this coat. We note AGENTS COWLEY, RICE, CLEGG + RORER. DORIS ROGERS ( 23) is Purvis' secretary. He brought her from his last post in Alabama along with Barton and Baum. We've entered mid-scene. 
PURVIS Then we will cross-reference every Dillinger family member and known associate in each locale. 
(BEAT) He was there. It got cold. He bought a coat. Therefore, he may have been harbored or have a safe house nearby. 
CONTINUED: (3) 
DILLINGER Homer stayin' steady? 
HAMILTON (reading his mind) He's okay. 
DILLINGER Three rules I learned from Walter Dietrich. One: never work with people who are desperate. Two: never work with people who aren't the best. Three: never work when you're not ready. Billie reappears, dancing with a young man. 
HAMILTON Well, I got rule four: stay away from women. 
DILLINGER Without women, I might as well have `stayed in stir. Anna Sage approaches with a young girl for Red. 
HAMILTON What's why they invented whores. (getting up) Hamilton leaves, arms around the women. Dillinger keeps his eye on Billie. Music ends. Young man escorts her to her table. He tries to join her. She turns him down. Dillinger finishes his drink, approaches. He now sees how beautiful Billie is. She's 5 foot 5. With a straight erect build, she stands out in any crowd. She looks Dillinger straight in the eye. Clear skin, dark eyes with humor playing about the edges. He unexpectedly starts to feel nervous. He gives her his best grin. 
DILLINGER I don't know what you said to your friend, but I sure am glad you did. Billie looks him over: a well-made man in a good suit with a great smile. And, paradoxes: he easily talks to women but he's not a hustler. He's young, but there's a world of experience in his face. Open, but he's holding something back. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: ( 4) 
DILLINGER (CONT'D) What's your name? 
BILLIE Billie Frechette. 
DILLINGER Buy you a drink? Billie looks at her girlfriend, she nods, Billie rises... As they cross to the bar. 
DILLINGER (CONT'B) Is that French? 
BILLIE On my father's side. There's an "e" at the end. Do you have a name? 
DILLINGER Jack Harris. Music changes to "Bye Bye Blackbird." 
BILLIE Do you dance, Jack? 
DILLINGER I don't know how. She smiles a pretty smile at him. 
BILLIE How come you don't know how to dance? Its easy. Follow me. This is a two-step. (he stares at her feet) Don't look at my feet. Look at my shoulders. She stays an inch or two distant in his arms. Its slow and languorous. He follows her with little difficulty. He can smell the perfume in her black hair. 
TORCH SINGER 
(SINGS) âPack-up all my cares and woe Here I go, singing low Bye, bye blackbird" 
DILLINGER My, but you are pretty. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: ( 5) They look into each other's eyes. He pulls her closer, wants to kiss her long smooth neck. He almost can't resist... Their lips are an inch apart. And then she rests her cheek on his shoulder and the kiss that wasn't hangs in the air around them. He whispers... 
DILLINGER. (CONT'D) Where you from, Billie? She turns her right ear towards him. She's deaf in her left ear. 
BILLIE Flandreau. 
DILLINGER Where's Flandreau.? 
TORCH SINGER 
(SINGS) "Where somebody waits for me Sugar's sweet, so is she Bye, bye blackbird..." 
BILLIE outh Dakota. 
DILLINGER Father's French, what's on the other side? 
BILLIE Italian. 
DILLINGER From South Dakota, Indian's likelier than Italian. She looks at him. 
BILLIE My momma's a Menominee Indian. But most men don't like that... 
DILLINGER I'm not most men. 
BILLIE And I check coats at the Steuben Club. What do you do, Jack? 
DILLINGER I'm catching up. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: ( 6) 
BILLIE Catching up on what? 
DILLINGER On life, meeting someone like you. (her hair) Dark, beautiful, like the black bird in that song... She laughs at the flattery. Holds his eyes a beat with an ironic look. A couple from another group looks at Dillinger. He's cool. He returns the look. They look away. 
DILLINGER (CONT`D) Say, how'd you like some dinner? 
BILLIE Sure. He nods courteously to her girlfriends, grabs her coat, puts a hand around Billie's waist and steers her out... 
TORCH SINGER 
(SINGS) "So make my bed and light the light Cause I'll be home late tonight Bye, bye blackbird... ." 
EXT. ARAGON BALLROOM - DILLINGER + BILLIE - NIGHT 
BAUM That noise on the line? That's called "swing". Nothing we can do about it. Some words get dropped. Were listening in on a car dealer. Harry Berman. Rice plays back a recording. 
VOICE (V.0.) When you drop it, leave the keys on the floorboard. (muffled; then...) 
B E RMAN (V.0.) I got a DeSoto. 
VOICE (V.0.) okay. 
BERMAN (V.0.) The interior's no good. 
VOICE (V.0.) Don't matter. It's a work. car. 
BAUM We think that's Dillinger's voice. 
PURVIS How did we find Berman? 
BAUM Dillinger's coat was bought in Cicero, Illinois, a few doors from Berman's dealership. Berman supplies cars to the syndicate. Since Capone. Dillinger must have been at Berman's switching cars when he bought that coat. 
(BEAT) Soon as they call to switch out the next car, we will tail them. Right to Dillinger. 
EXT. NORTH DEARBORN STREET - JOHN DILLINGER - NIGHT 
gets out of his Buick... 
INT. STEUBEN CLUB - DILLINGER - NIGHT 
enters, sees Billie talking with another hostess, MAY 
MINCZELES. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: TWO MEN approach. Billie checks their hats and coats. To Dillinger... 
BILLIE (without looking up) May I check your coat, sir? 
DILLINGER No, honey. You go get your coat. She looks up. So does May. May flashes Billie a look: if you don't want him, I do. 
MAY MINCZELES Sounds good to me. Dillinger has eyes only for Billie. 
DILLINGER You ran out on me. 
BILLIE `you left me standing alone on the sidewalk. 
DILLINGER I 'you're going to be my girl, you have swear you'll never do that again. 
BILLIE I'm not your girl! A CUSTOMER comes up and puts his ticket on the counter. 
CUSTOMER Brown overcoat. 
BILLIE (ignoring customer) I am not your girl and I'm not going to say that. 
DILLINGER I'm waiting. 
CUSTOMER So am I. 
DILLINGER. (to Billie) "I am not ever going to run out on you again." Say it. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: ( 2) 
BILLIE No. 
DILLINGER Well, I will never run out on you. And that's a promise. 
CUSTOMER Well, I want to run out of here. So, lady, will you get my coat...? Dillinger lifts the man two feet off the floor and slams him into the wall. Real jailhouse rage. The lethally cold eyes tells the customer everything he needs to know. Dillinger swings him to the counter, grabs the man's ticket, slams thru the half door, finds the man's coat, tosses it at him... 
DILLINGER Keep the tip. (to Billie) You ain't getting other people's hats and coats no more either. He takes her coat and holds it for her. She doesn't move. 
BILLIE No one's ever done that for me before. 
DILLINGER You're with me now. 
BILLIE I don't know anything about you. 
DILLINGER I was raised on a farm in Mooresville, Indiana. My ma died when I was three. My daddy beat the hell out of me because he didn't know no better way to raise me. I used to do dumb things but I'm a lot smarter now. I like baseball, movies, good clothes, fast cars, and you. What else do you need to know? She gets into her coat. Dillinger opens the door for her. They exit, watched by May. 
TNT. DILLINGER'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - BILLIE - NIGHT enters. It's large, low-ceilinged, luxurious and modern --- Billie is bowled over. He sits her down on a sofa. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: He goes into a closet to get two Marshall Fields boxes and two drinks. 
BILLIE You been living here long? 
DILLINGER Yeah. Since yesterday. From a back bedroom (Red's) a phonograph is louder as a door opens and Red enters the kitchen in a robe for a drink. He returns. Laughter. Dillinger has the boxes and drinks. 
DILLINGER (CONT'D) I got something for you. 
(BEAT) What's wrong? Open it up. Billie opens the boxes. She lifts out a sleeveless dress in dusty pink. It is beautiful. She is very touched. The second has a coat with a fur color. But still... 
INT. APARTMENT 302, LIVING ROOM/DINING ROOM - THEY ENTER 
LEONARD is a thin short man at a table finishing dinner. He is fresh-faced, maybe a junior clerk at an insurance company. Not John Dillinger... 
LEONARD Something wrong? 
PURVIS You have identification? 
LEONARD Honey, would you get my driver's licence. It's in my coat pocket. Leonard sums reluctant to get up. With his right hand, he takes a forkful of food. His left is under the table. Now, we see that he:.'s holding... 
A COLT 45_.-,AUTOMATIC Who is this man? 
LEONARD (CONTÂ°D) You're that.. .Melvin Purvis. I've seen your picture! 
PURVIS What do you do for a living, Leonard? 
LEONARD I travel in ladies shoes. He smiles at his joke. Vi enters with his wallet. Barton sees the driver's license. 
LEONARD (CONT'D) Show him, honey. Vi Scott puts a foot forward - a red shoe with a bow. 
PURVIS Do you carry around samples? 
LEONARD Sure. Big suitcases. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
PURVIS (handing back the licence) Enjoy the rest of your dinner, Mr. McHenry. 
LEONARD Thanks. 
INT. CARPETED HALLWAY ON THIRD FLOOR - PURVIS + BARTON 
walk the length of the hall. Vi closed the door behind them. 
PURVIS 
(LOW) Its all wrong. No one in or out. I'll get the others. (at door to stairs next to the elevator door) Stay here, watch that door from right here. Purvis leaves. Barton wants to do it right. Then, he hears movement from Apt. 302. Objects being hurriedly shifted. He starts back down the hallway. Halfway between it and the elevator... 
PING! Behind him, the elevator doors open. Barton turns hi.,,back on Apt. 302. He's caught between 302 and the elevator.-".- 
TOMMY CARROLL (38) a flat-nosed ex-con enters. He looks curiously at Barton. 
BARTON Bureau of Investigation. What's your name? (flashes badge) 
CARROLL You wanna know my name? Barton sees Carroll's eyes flicker, slight smile. He spins... 
AN INDIFFERENT "BABY FACE" NELSON FIRES his .45. BLAM! BLAM! Barton's slammed forward. Nelson looks at Barton, prostrate, convulsing. He FIRES a third round. 
EXT. STREET - PURVIS 
PURVIS Pull the men from Sheridan and Wilson. 
PURVIS -reacting- grabs the Thompson from Madala and runs back inside. 
EXT. SHERONE APARTMENTS - BAUM 
runs to the corner of the building where he has a visual on the building front entrance and the DeSoto down the alley. 
INT. THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - PURVIS 
enters, sees... 
BARTON in the final moments of his life. Barton looks up into Purvis` eyes: Help me! Purvis does not know what to do. Then Barton's eyes drift away... Purvis impels himself to action. He kicks in the door to Apt. 
INT. APT 30.2 VI SCOTT 
screams. 
PURVIS Where is he?! 
EXT. SHERONE APARTMENTS - BAUM 
sees - 
BABY FACE NELSON + TOMMY CARROLL quickly cross the alley from the back stairs to the Desoto. And Nelson immediately lays down rounds in careful short BLASTS of full auto. Tommy Carroll calmly, smoothly starts the DeSoto. Nelson's barrage punches into the wall, drives Daum to cover. 
INT. SHERONE APARTMENTS - PURVIS 
slams open a window. The DeSoto accelerates out of the alley. Purvis FIRES a few rounds. Baum FIRES his pistol. Both are useless at that range. The DeSoto has turned left and is gone. 
EXT. SHERONE APARTMENTS -- PURVIS 
races in from the front door. Rice and Madala drive up in the Bureau's armor-plated Ford V-8. 
PURVIS They headed north! The Sheridan Road car? 
RICE That's us. We heard gunfire. So we. (gets it) .came here. They're fucked. 
MADALA Was it Dillinger? 
HURT I'm going to the men's room. Winstead spots a shoe-shine stand. Winstead sits, nods and the SHOE SHINE MAN begins to polish his Western boots. He's startled bi:the knife in a sheath built into the right boot. 
WINSTEAD Wcrk around it. From under the brim of his hat, Winstead glances at big city life in Union Station. He's an ominous presence. HEAR the excited roar of a CROWD and we --

(NODS) Annenberg wants to sell you the remaining equity in General News. 
NITTI How's he doing on the wire service? 
PHIL D'ANDREA Feeding to 300 bookies now. And he came up with this gimmick called a scratch sheet. Another beat. Nitti stops for a beat 
NITTI Its hot out, right? 
PHIL D'ANDREA Yeah, Frank. 
NITTI Ever since those pricks shot me I can't get warm. (notices Phil's attention) What? 
PHIL D' ANDREA Some friends from Chicago in the stands... D'Andrea nods. John Dillinger nods back. Nitti glances at them; glances away. Dillinger has on sunglasses. Billie is wearing a straw hat. They are shouting to the greyhounds along with Pierpont, Homer and Makley and some girls. They have tall drinks. This is the good life for the privileged few in the middle of the Depression. A dog wins; not theirs. It calms down... 
DILLINGER (to Pierpont; business) Well drive out separately. 
(MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: ( 2) 
DILLINGER (CONT'D) Billie and I want to hit the Gulf Coast on the way to Arizona. 
PIERPONT I want to take 66 and check banks in Denver and Phoenix. We'll meet you in Tucson on the 25th. 
VAN METER I think we wore out the Midwest for awhile. 
(BEAT) I heard one today. Indiana paper. 
(LOW) "Wanted. John Dillinger. Dead or...dead." (they crack up) Billie doesn't laugh. Dillinger pulls her close and she can't resist his good spirits. D'Andrea's approached... 
PHIL D'ANDREA How d'ya like the track? C'mon to the Gc: -lonial for steaks tonight. (writing on a card) You be our guests... 
DILLINGER Well be there. 
PHIL D'ANDREA (to cocktail waitress) Whatever these boys want, its on the house. He leaves. Pierpont, Makley and Homer go off to place new bets. Billie looks at Dillinger. Looks away. Dillinger catches her... 
DILLINGER What? She is quiet for a moment. 
BILLIE Thank you, thank you for these last few weeks. I never thought I'd see Florida. 
DILLINGER You going somewhere, doll, am I? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) 
BILLIE It's been, three, four weeks. You'll look for a change. Or you'll get tired of me. And then I'll be sad and angry. So I wanted to say thank you before then... Dillinger is surprised that her expectations are so low. She didn't think his interest in her to be more than passing. 
DILLINGER You want to leave? 
BILLIE No. But I'm no fool. I'll be back checking coats at the Steuben Club. 
DILLINGER Well, I don't want you to leave. So it won't be that way. 
BILLIE Then it will be another way that's worse. 
(BEAT) You rob banks and you run rings around them, but you're likely to get killed or, get shot and... 
DILLINGER Who the hell gave you a crystal ball?! 
WILLIE Well, goddamn it, you don't need a crystal ball...! Ask Homer. 
DILLINGER Homer what...? 
BILLIE Homer and his damn joke... I don't want to be around to see any of that. Okay?! That's what it's about... Dillinger gets it. 
DILLINGER I am not going anywhere! I am going to die in your arms as an old man when that time comes. So what do you say about that? 
DILLINGER (CONT'D) 
(BEAT) They pulled on us right out. Didn't ask Washington for permission. Didn't make mistakes. Arizona Deputies enjoy the flattery. Dillinger studies Purvis... 
DILLINGER (CONT'D) Sorry about that fellow Barton.. .one who got killed at the Sherone Apartments. Is he getting to Purvis? 
DILLINGER (CONT ' D) Newspaper said you found him alive. It's the eyes, ain't it? They look at you right before they go. Then they drift into nothing. Keep you up nights. 
PURVIS What keeps you up, nights, Mr. Dillinger? Now Dillinger reads him like an X-ray. 
DILLINGER (doesn't answer) You act like a confident man, Purvis. Bu _, I don't see it. You know a few things. You're probably okay when there's a groupÂ° of you got the other guy outnumbered. But death and mayhem up close? I am used to that and you are not, are you? When it's toe to toe, "One of us will die right here, right now," I don't think you got the get up and go. Purvis has nothing to say. He stares at Dillinger. Then he turns to leave. 
PURVIS Goodbye, Mr. Dillinger. 
DILLINGER I'll see you down the road. From ten feet away. 
PURVIS 
(QUIETLY) No you wont. The only way you'll leave a jail cell is when we take you out to execute you. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
DILLINGER Oh, yeah? We will see about that. 
(BEAT) Go get yourself another line of work, Melvin. Purvis gestures for the guards to let him out -- Dillinger lays back down on his cot. The Tucson Deputies stare after Purvis, one laughs. After a moment... 
DILLINGER (CONT'D) (to Tucson Deputies) I was joking about the "we'll see about that." I'll let you boys keep me in this jail awhile. 
COP EYMAN We'd like that, Johnny, but don't get too comfortable. They're moving you. 
DILLINGER `Where to? 
COP EYMAN 'Indiana. 
DILLINGER why? I have absolutely nothing I want to do in Indiana.

DEPUTY He's here. A diminutive woman, SHERIFF HOLLEY goes to greet the massive cops who bring John Dillinger into her reception area and its crowd of 30 reporters. 
SHERIFF HOLLEY (to reporters) Back up over there. Dellinger looks at the crowd. Per the "Chicago Daily News "His diction was amazing - better in many instances than that of his interviewers -- his poise no less so... There Was no hint of hardness about him, no evidence save in the alert presence of armed policemen that he had spent his formative years in a penitentiary. He had none of the sneer of-the criminal... Looking at him for the first time.,.heIates as the most amazing specimen of his kind ever seen outside of wildly imaginative moving picture." 
SHERIFF HOLLEY (CONT'D) You can take the manacles off of him now.

PHOTOGRAPHER Hey Bob... (to Prosecutor Robert Estill) Put your arm around Dellinger. FLASHBULBS POP. They fluster Estill. Dillinger props his elbow on the prosecutor's shoulder and cracks a broad grin. The Prosecutor complies. They look like old pals. 
REPORTER When was the last time you were in Mooresville? 
DILLINGER Ten years ago. I was a boy and foolish. I held up a grocery store which I never shoulda done cause Mr. Morgan was a good man. And they sentenced me to 10 years in the state penitentiary for a 50 dollar theft. In prison, I met a lot of good -t las. I helped fix up the break at "f chigan City. Why not? I stick to my friends and they stick to me. 
DILLINGER'S EYES SEE him work the reporters. He knows that they are sympathetic. He plays them like a champ. The New York Times called this moment... "a modern version of the return of the prodigal son." 
ANOTHER REPORTER How long does it take you to go through a bank? 
DILLINGER One minute and 40 seconds flat. Dillinger nods and turns away. He - not the Sheriff - ends the press conference. 
RED HAMILTON'S front sight rests on Zarkovich's heart which he would blow out the back of his chest with the souped-up 351 Winchester. Now, Dillinger pulls the '34 Ford out of the backyard with Red still on the running board. Zarkovich almost faints in relief.

DILLINGER I went to East Chicago to lay low. The welcome mat was not out. And I kept hearing your name.

D'ANDREA (irritated; to Catena) Anybody see him come in? 
GILBERT I don't think so. SOLDIER ONE. Dillinger turns the man, slams a knee into his kidney, pulls him back off balance, holds him up with one 45 under his jaw, as he draws the second 45 and sweeps the group... 
DILLINGER Wanna know if we're armed? Were armed. He dumps this guy on his ass, his heavy shoe an ounce from crushing his larynx. Red's two Thompsons concealed on shoulder straps are out from under his coat. Frozen time. Phil D'Andrea sits on the corner of a table. Only he stays relaxed. 
D'ANDREA k around, Johnny. What do you see? 
1 1 DILLINGER A`lot of telephones. 
D'ANDREA You see money. Before last month there were independent wire services letting bookies know who won the third race at Sportman's Park. 300 of 'em. Now there's only one. Ours. General News. Nationwide. On October20, you robbed the bank in Green Castle, Indiana. You got away with $74,802. Split 5 ways, that's $14,960.40. You probably thought that was a big score. Dillinger stares at him. Where's this going? 
D'ANDREA (CONT'D) (indicates the room) This room makes that much every day. That is how money gets made. And it keeps getting made, day after day after day. It is a river of money. Flowing right to us. And it gets deeper and it gets wider.

DILLINGER I'm popular. 
D'ANDREA You're bad for business. What this is, is called obsolescence.

WINSTEAD What's playin' at the Marbro? What's playin' at the Biograph? It hadn't occurred to anybody to find that out. 
MANDALA (from newspaper) Marbro...a Shirley Temple movie called "Moptop." Biograph is playing a gangster-, picture starring Clark Gable. "Manhattan::: Melodrama." 
WINSTEAD John Dillinger ain't going to a Shirley Temple movie. 
PURVIS Sergeant Zarkovich and Special Agent Winstead will be at the Biograph. As will I and Special Agent Madala. 
(BEAT) Virgil Peterson, coordinate the Marbro. The rest of you will wait here until it's determined which theater. Looks between Zarkovich and Capt. O'Neill. They have to INSURE Dillinger is killed, not captured. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ANNA SAGE APARTMENT, BATHROOM - DILLINGER - EVENING 
shaves. His watch is open in front of him. In the inside of the case is a picture of Billie. He washes the soap from his face. He looks at her... 
INT. BEDROOM - A LOCKED CASE 
Opens. From it Dillinger pockets a Colt 380 automatic and loads $3,000 into a moneybelt from rubber-banded bundles and puts it around his waist. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. MARBRO THEATER - SOPSIC - NIGHT 
On a pay phone. Patrons buy tickets. He listens... 
SOPSIC Not yet. 
EXT. BIOGRAPH - AGENT BROWN 
puts down the pay phone. Mouths "not yet" to.. 
INT. CAR: VIS 
down the street in a parked car. In the driver's seat is Reinecke. He's tense, trying to stay calm. On his upper lip sweat beads. Does he remember the words of Billie about what Dillinger would do to him? 
CU: PURVIS watches the crowds thin as showtime nears. He gets out of the car. Is Dillinger a no-show? Another failure? Another eviscerating memo from Hoover? THREE FIGURES BRUSH PAST HIM. A woman's orange skirt. Its Anna Sage, Polly Hamilton, and John Dillinger. They sweep to the ticket booth, pay, and join latecomers rushing inside so that they don't miss the start of the movie. 
PURVIS is stunned. Dillinger passed three feet from him. 
CHICAGO P.D. DRIVER/SGT. Before you shoot him, get his I.D. 
CHICAGO P.D. DETECTIVE Who the hell are you? 
SUB N Department of Justice. Bureau of Investigation! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
CHICAGO P.D. DETECTIVE What do you think you're doing here? 
SURAN Were on a federal stakeout! Put that gun down and back those cars out of the alley. But stay close because we may need you. 
CHICAGO P.D. DETECTIVE You may need us?" Fuck you, college boy. Let's see your goddamn badge! Suran's looking down both barrels. 
INT. BIOGRAPH - SCREEN: MYRNA LOY 
MYRNA LOY I love you more than anything, Blackie, you know...? She stops. 
DILLINGER'S mesmerized' her eyes and soft skin. We SEE in his hyper reality thee satin tones on the screen. Myrna Loy's insouciance,;like Billies, speaks to him. Meanwhile... 
EXT. LINCOLN BOULEVARD - AGENT MCCARTHY + EAST CHICAGO COPS 
SOPSIC + STRETCH empty their pockets, trying to identify themselves to TWO HUGE CHICAGO P.D. DETECTIVE who've drawn down on them. Zarkovich starts arguing, not believing this is happening. More Chicago PD arrive. Meanwhile... 
INT. CAR - PURVIS 
starts across the street to straighten out the Chicago P.D. Sergeant. While... 
CUT TO: 
INT. BIOGRAPH - SCREEN: BLACKIE GALLAGHER (CLARK GABLE) 
walks the long walk through the cell block... 
JOHN DILLINGER the actual Public Enemy #1 watches the celluloid gangster walk to the electric chair... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
PRISONER See ya, Blackie. 
CLARK GABLE stops at the cell. 
CLARK GABLE Die the way you lived. All of a sudden. 
ECU: DILLINGER'S EYES startle, Is this a message? 
CLARK GABLE 
CLARK GABLE (CONT'D) Don't drag it out. 
GRAIN STRUCTURE OF THE FACE OF GABLE speaking these important words... 
CLARK GABLE (CONT'D) .that doesn't count for anything. There's no more point to it. 
CU: DILLINGER He sees inwards. And he knows it won't happen. Them=E no Mexico with Billie. There's no freighter to Manila.- He will die. This day, this month, next month. He knows that in this instant. 
JOHN DILLINGER. LOOKING UP AT THE SCREEN. In this Hollywood version of life, the power of cause and effect operates on the end, as inescapably as gravity. It's a core truth. This is the only end for Blackie Gallagher. And its as true for john Dillinger in his life as it is for Gallagher. Actions and historical forces have made his time be up. Dillinger SLOWS the flickering images. His concentration slices time into component parts. Gable exchanges last good- byes. He warns his D.A. friend, Ronald Coleman, not to commute his sentence. The images play on Dillinger's face. They take him over-alone in the packed theater while 25 Federal Agents and five East Chicago cops wait outside. 
BLACKIE GALLAGHER 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) enters the execution chamber. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. BIOGRAPH - PURVIS 
glances at his watch. He rips a match from the matchbook, ready to light the cigar. The lobby is empty. The dim music of the finale leaks out. 
EXT. DOORWAY - WINSTEAD + CLARENCE HURT 
wait. Winstead coolly watches Purvis. 
INT. CAR - REINECKE'S 
right hand shakes. He can't control it. He grips the steering wheel to make it stop. 
EXT. BAKERY STEPS - ZARKOVICH 
ignores the Chicago detectives. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BIOGRZPH - ANNA SAGE 
looks at the backs of heads in the rows in front of her. She doesn't want to miss Dillinger if he leaves. A celiblock. The cellblock lights dim, a convict says... 
DILLINGER .tell Billie... Only Charles Winstead hears the rest. 
PURVIS unloads Dillinger's gun. His gun-handling of Dillinger's gun is a lot better than his gun-handling of his own under stress. 
PURVIS What did he say? 
WINSTEAD I couldn't hear him. 
PURVIS You look after this. I need to call Washington. Zarkovich`houlders through the gathering crowd of 
PEDESTRIAN s=and newsmen, sees the head wound, the glazing over of Diflinger's eyes. He knows he's safe. 
JOHN DILLINGER'S EYES get dreamy, then they seem to focus far away. Then they seem to focus not at all. 
PURVIS (CONT'D) Cover his face and keep the damn photographers away. 
AERIAL: LINCOLN AVENUE Purvis starts away and we SEE the Biograph marquee, the trolley tracks in the cobblestone street, the alley, and the hundreds of people moving towards the locus of the dead John Dillinger. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CANAL STREET DRY CLEANERS (NEW ORLEANS) - HOOVER - 
ANOTHER DAY watches Tolson who is at the window. Tolson gets a sign. Hoover straightens his collar. He brushes lint off his pants leg. Tolson waits. Hoover waits. 
EXT. CANAL STREET HOTEL - DOOR 
opens. Alvin Karpis comes out. In the hot, humid New Orleans air, his suit coat is off...he carries it under his arm. He crosses the street towards his Lincoln Coupe. His eyes land on a man on a bench across the street looking at him over a newspaper. And while crossing the street, Alvin slows down. 
THE MAN IS CHARLES WINSTEAD The newspaper hides a sawn-off, 10 gauge Winchester lever action shotgun. 
ALVIN LOOKS TO HIS LEFT: CLARENCE HURT leans on a lamp post. His body hides a 351 Winchester rifle. 
NOW ALVIN KARPIS freezes. He doesn't hesitate. He opens his hands to demonstrate he is holding nothing and lets his jacket; fall to the ground. He knows instantly who they are and that.,,they intend to kill him. Karpis' eyes dart to the roofto isÂ°. Snipers on both. In this instant, Karpis knows he is done. One objective races into his mind: stay alive. 
KARPIS' stretches out his arms, wide. Winstead has dropped the newspaper. The sawed-off 10 gauge is aimed squarely at Alvin's chest. Karpis is displaying he is unarmed. Winstead approaches warily step-by-step. His weapon would cut Alvin in half. Clarence, the rifle at his shoulder, inches forward. The ex-Texas Ranger gunfighters with real trigger-time have taken Alvin Karpis. 
ALVIN KARPIS I am unarmed. 
WINSTEAD Don't even breathe sudden. 
WINSTEAD Â± CAMPBELL + HURT are 10 feet from him. Clarence pats him down. Karpis is clean. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: The Texans cover Alvin and move him to the sidewalk near his car. 
HURT Put your hands on the roof of that Lincoln. (he does) Other agents come running in. Someone's yelling: We got him! We got him. Bring him in." While they wait... 
WINSTEAD Where you from? 
ALVIN KARPIS Canada, but mostly Chicago. (to both) You? 
WINSTEAD Fort Worth, thereabouts. Clarence is from Tyler. 
(PAUSE) Well, Alvin. You're a sly old dog. If ,you'd a even had that jacket on... A ring ofc tints with their revolvers out, now converge around Karpis. 
HURT (to Agent) Any handcuffs around here? They don't have any. They had not planned on needing them. One agent is excited. His gun pointed at Karpis shakes. 
AL V I N KARP I S Mind asking that man to... 
HURT (to Agent) Put that down. The agent drops his gun. 
EXT. STREET - HOOVER 
in his white suit and Tolson rush in from the dry cleaners where they were stashed. The agents part. They suddenly stand in front of Alvin Karpis. Hoover's 38 Chief Special is at his side. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
TOLSON 
(PROMPTING) "You are under... 
HOOVER You are under arrest for the...Wahpeton, South Dakota bank robbery. Tolson waves to an agent across the street. 
WIDE ON THE CORNER: REPORTERS + PHOTOGRAPHERS are now released and rush towards us. 
HOOVER regains his composure. 
HOOVER (CONT'D) I heard of your fishing prowess. i myself, always wanted, to catch a marlin... 
ALVIN KARPIS You're thinking of my partner, Harry Campbell. 
HOOVER Are you relieved its over? I'm sure you are. 
(PAUSE) You know you will feel much better once you get everything off your chest. 
(PAUSE) Why don't you tell me where Harry Campbell is? After a moment.. 
ALVIN KARPIS Who do you think you're talking to? Hoover is silent.

SOMETHING'S GOTTA GIVE 
Nancy Meyers June 14, 2002 
OVER BLACK 
We hear, Ja Rule's "Livin' It Up"... 
EXT. NEW YORK CITY - A HOT AUGUST NIGHT - MUSIC OVER 
MIDTOWN. A Brunette Beauty crosses in front of a stack of cabs, her sheer dress clinging to her remarkable body. A Club in THE MEATPACKING DISTRICT. A long line waits to get in. A couple of Gorgeous Girls show up at the velvet rope and are promptly" let inside. SOHO. A Crowd spills out of a Bar and onto the sidewalk. A Confident Knock Out in jeans and a tank top laughs, drinking a beer out of the bottle. 
HARRY (V.O.) 
Ahhhh... The sweet, uncomplicated satisfaction of The Younger Woman. That fleeting age when everything just falls right into place. It's magic time and it can render any man, anywhere -- absolutely helpless. Some say I'm an expert on The Younger Woman. Guess that's 'cause I've been dating them for over forty years... 
INTO AN EMPTY FRAME COMES HARRY LANGER 
What is it about him? Could be his eyes, the turn of his mouth...something about this guy is just so damn appealing. Maybe it's just the way he wears the Young Slinky Girl on his arm. He's confident, cool, enviable. We're in: 
A CHIC EATERY - DOWNTOWN 
The place is full. Everybody is somebody here. 
HARRY 
(to Hostess) Langer. .. The Maitre'd snaps to attention at the sight of him. 
MAITRE'D 
Mr. Langer, got your table waiting. As Harry and his Girl wend their way around tables, we pass Other Couples. Young Couples. Middle-aged couples. Not talking Couples. 
HARRY (V.O.) 
So what does a life of bucking the system all add up to? 
HARRY (V.O.) (CONT'D) 
To never settle down with the right woman for a life of leftovers and Christmas mornings. No his and her IRA accounts, no mini van parked in the garage. I think it's made me what I am today. (Harry smiles to someone across the room) The luckiest son of a bitch on earth. Look at me. I'm positively debonair. I should be illegal I'm lookin' so good. Harry passes a table where a BEATEN SIXTY YEAR OLD dines with his AGE APPROPRIATE, WELL-FED WIFE. IN SLOW MOTION, Harry and The Beaten Man catch each other's glance. 
HARRY (V.O.) 
It isn't as if I haven't wondered what my life would be like if I was a Regular Joe and came in here once a month with a dame my age' for a porterhouse and a side of I         spinach. I've wondered... 
NT. CHIC EATERY - HARRY'S IMAGINATION 
Harry ENTERS all over again. This time he looks older, something in his walk and the boxy cut of his jacket. With him is a regular looking, nothing-to-write-home-about WOMAN 
IN HER FIFTIES. 
HARRY (V.O.) 
No, come on, let's be honest. ..a dame really my age. . . 
INT. CHIC EATERY - HARRY'S IMAGINATION - TAKE TWO 
Again, the identical set up. Harry ENTERS again. This time he looks ten years older. The bounce to his step is gone. The twinkle in his eye, long dead. On his arm is a 63 YEAR OLD BATTLE AX, built just like Harry. The Maitre'd reluctantly shows them to a shitty table. 
HARRY (V.O.) 
There you have it. The story in a nutshell. Not exactly debonair, am I? (Harry TRIPS, his wife looks disgusted) Awww, man, it's down right sad. Look at me. I look like I'm about to die. God help me. I do not want to die. 
SMASH CUT TO: 
A LONG STRETCH OF PRISTINE COUNTRY ROAD - THE HAMPTONS - DAY 
A Silver Mercedes convertible bursts into FRAME. Harry's behind the wheel, shades, smoking a cigar, livin' large. Next to him sits a thoroughbred of a girl. An "IT" Girl. Smart, sexy and built for fun. She has perfected flirting to an art. Her hand rests on Harry's neck. There's a good thirty year age difference between them. Her name is MARIN. She SINGS along with Ja Rule, now coming from a CD. 
MARIN 
( singing) To all my thugs that be livin' it up, we say, what I do. To all my... (stops) Oh! This is it. Make a right. 
HARRY 
(admiring the neighborhood) So baby, you're rich... . 
MARIN 
Well, my mother is, sort of. Not really... 
HARRY 
If she lives within a mile of here, she's rich. 
MARIN 
I guess a hit play will buy you a house in The Hamptons. 
HARRY 
I'd like to meet your mother. 
MARIN 
No you wouldn't. I mean, she's great. She's totally brilliant, but she's not your type. 
HARRY 
You're overlooking one of the great things about me. I don't have a type. 
MARIN 
(very directly) She's over thirty. Harry looks to Marin, feigning hurt. 
MARIN 
Oh, what?! Like you don't know you have a slight reputation for... 
Just then the CAR PHONE RINGS. Harry keeps looking at Marin. 
HARRY 
-- For what? Harry waits. RINGGG! He doesn't look away. 
MARIN 
For never dating anyone over 30. Don't look at me like that. 
HARRY 
It's just not true. 
MARIN 
Okay. Sorry. Over 31? 
HARRY 
Oh, so you wait 'til we get out to The Hamptons to let me know you're a wise ass. (answers phone) Hold on. . . (then to Marin) It just so happens, my dear, that women of a certain age, don't date me. You ever think of it that way? No, it's always me. You dames are all alike. (then into phone) Hey... 
MARIN 
(amused, to herself) Dames... Marin continues singing along with Ja Rule as Harry confidently slips his hand onto her thigh. 
BARRY 
(into phone) Vh-huh.. .I'll call back Monday. Who else? Monday... Monday... Say you couldn't find me. Who? (glances at Marin, she's not listening) I'll call her later. No, I have it. Harry hangs up, doesn't look in Marin's direction to see if' she caught that. This brand of cool is about not playing that card. Marin turns toward him, she has been listening. They've reached the end of the road, sand dunes, long lilting grass and the ocean stretch before them. 
HARRY 
(eyeing the knife) Do you... live here? 
ERICA 
Okay, Mister, look, I'm gonna dial 911 and you're not gonna move. Zoe, hand me the phone. (reaches out to Zoe without looking at her) 
HARRY 
You don't understand. I'm a friend of your daughter's. With that, Harry SHUTS the fridge door. The Women see he's naked except for a Pair of Boxers. They both GASP. Zoe FUMBLES the phone over to Erica who dials quickly.. 
ERICA 
Yeah? I don't think so. My daughter's in the city and you what, wandered in here,like high on Ecstasy..?. (looks at phone) Shit. I dialed 8-1-1. (redials) 
HARRY 
(calmly starts to move) Honestly, if you just... 
ERICA 
Back off. She was in the Israeli army. She can break you in half. Zoe can't believe she just said that -- no truth in it whatsoever. 
ERICA 
(into phone) Yes. I have an intruder in my house. 29 Daniels Lane, Sagaponack. 
HARRY 
I'm dating your daughter Marin. She invited me here for the weekend. She's in her room right now, changing. 
ERICA 
(GASPS even louder, really scared now) You're dating my daughter? 
HARRY 
(amused) Now who would've thought that would be worse news? With that, Marin ENTERS, in a tiny bikini, sees Harry in his shorts, Zoe holding the knife and Erica frozen, holding the phone. 
MARIN 
Oh, fuck. 
ERICA 
Oh, God. (into phone) I'm sorry. False alarm. Yeah, no, I'm sure. No, he's not a burglar (with enormous difficulty) He's dating my daughter. 
MARIN 
Mom, I had no idea you were coming out this weekend, you said you had to write. 
ERICA 
I do. I thought I'd do it out here. 
MARIN 
Oh, man, this is really.... 
ERICA 
Awkward. 
MARIN 
Totally.. .but.... (starts laughing) You gotta admit, sorta funny You thought he was a burglar? In his boxer shorts? 
ERICA 
Yeah, well, the world's nuts, I don't know the man. . . 
MARIN 
(still laughing) I'm sorry, it's not really funny. I'm an idiot. I should've told you I was bringing someone out. 
E 
RICA 
No, no, I should've told you we were coming. Well. Anyway, here we are. (waves to Harry) Hello. I'm the mother. 
All three Women turn to Harry who now dangles a long Lobster shaped oven mitt over his "privates"... 
HARRY 
Harry Langer. How are ya? 
MARIN 
Yes. Sorry... Mom, this is my friend, Harry. Harry, my Mom, Erica... my Aunt, Zoe. (they all shake hands) Harry's sort of a new friend. I think I mentioned him in an e-mail. We just, totally spur of the moment thought we'd get out of the city for a few days. 
ERICA AND ZOE 
Of course...Right...Great... 
ERICA 
(can't look at him) Honey, does Harry have a robe? 
HARRY 
(backing out) You know what? Actually, I think I should just take off. Let you gals enjoy your weekend... Marin shoots her Mom a look. Help! 
ERICA 
No, no, no. Don't be silly. Uh, look, here's what we'll do. Zoe and I will leave. We took a great walk on the beach, we'll go into town for lunch. You two stay. Harry, apologize about the near arrest. 
HARRY 
No, you were impressive. Very strong, very... "macho". 
ERICA 
(a little thrown) I don't think I was exactly "macho" 
HARRY 
Trust me, if I ever catch a guy in his underwear in my refrigerator I hope I'm half the man you were, Mrs uh... 
ERICA 
(already hating him) Yeah. Okay. Whatever... Marin watches. Dying. 
HARRY 
All righty then...I'm definitely gonna hit the road. (salutes Erica and Zoe) Ladies...sensational meeting you. (then to Marin) Doll, call me. 
ZOE 
Hold on. Hold on. Let's not get so dramatic here. What are we four teenagers? We're all sophisticated people. Why can't we all stay, for the weekend? Your mother's got work to do I've got papers to grade. You'll do your thing, whatever that is and if we want to hang together, we'll hang together. If we don't, we don't. There's no reason why any of us should give up this spectacular weekend. 
MARIN 
Seriously. I can handle it. 
ZOE 
Hip Hop? Oh, rap? Oh, right. Well. (with disdain) Okay. That's... "interesting"... 
HARRY 
Let me see if I get where you're headed here. . . 
ERICA 
I'm sorry, but, look, you know I hate rap, I mean I do. It's sort of violent and crude for my taste, not to mention just a tad misogynistic. 
HARRY 
Hey, a lot of people see rapping as poetry. 
ERICA 
Yeah, but come on, how many words can you rhyme with 'Bitch'? Erica places her groceries on the check out counter. 
MARIN 
(joining Harry) How we doin? 
HARRY 
Should've left when she tried to arrest me. 
INT. ERICA'S DINING ROOM - THAT NIGHT 
Marin serves plates of pasta with lobster. Zoe pours wine and Erica tosses a salad. Harry is the only one sitting. 
MARIN 
So, Mom, how's the new play? You gettin' happy with it? Marin places a plate in front of Harry then runs her finger along "the nape of his neck. They smile at each other as she continues on. Erica notices, tries not to respond. 
ERICA 
Well, the thing with me is that I'm about 90% hard word, 10% talent and so far the talent part hasn't exactly kicked in yet. 
ZOE 
Yeah, right... 
HARRY 
What's your play about? Marin and Zoe stop what they are doing and turn to Erica. She's hesitant to reveal this. 
ERICA 
About? Well, I'm not exactly sure which is a bit of a problem, but so far it's about a divorced woman, a writer, she's this high strung, over-amped, controlling, know it all neurotic. . . (everyone stares at her) Who's incredibly cute and lovable. (more stares) It's a comedy. (takes a seat next to Zoe) 
M 
So, how did you two meet? 
ARIN 
At a Wine Auction at Sotheby's. Harry was the big buyer of the night. 
HARRY 
I kept winking at Marin as she was conducting the auction and apparently every time I did that she misunderstood and I ended up buying cases of outrageously expensive wine. 
Zoe and Marin laugh. 
ERICA 
Ever been married, Harry? 
HARRY 
No. No, I haven't. 
ERICA 
Wow. Now why do you think that is? 
HARRY 
Some people just don't fit the mold. And so far... 
ERICA 
Hey, if it ain't broke. 
HARRY 
Exactly. Harry leans back, places his arm around Marin's chair. Erica takes note. 
ZOE 
Wait a second, aren't you like a famous bachelor? 
HARRY 
I wouldn't say I'm famous. 
ZOE 
No, I think I read a piece on you in New York Magazine. 
HARRY 
I guess people find it interesting that I've escaped the noose for so long. 
ZOE 
Yeah, wasn't the name of the article, "The Escape Artist"? 
ERICA 
Wait. I read that article. That was you? You were once engaged to somebody big. Who was it? Not Joan Collins.. .Wait. ..Carly Simon? 
ZOE 
Yeah, it was somebody cool like that. (trying to remember) Not Martha Stewart.... 
MARIN 
You could just ..'ask him. 
HARRY 
No, this is more fun. It's like I'm not here. 
MARIN 
Harry was once engaged to Diane Sawyer. Okay? 
ZOE 
Right. Diane Sawyer. I love her. 
ERICA 
(stunned) I'm impressed. 
HARRY 
MARIN 
(hugs her back) I love you more. This is obviously a ritual between them. Erica kisses Marin's cheek in a flutter of kisses, then Marin 
EXITS. 
ZOE 
No chance he said we were nice. 
ERICA 
Please. None. They HEAR MUSIC coming from Marin's bedroom. 
ZOE 
What are they listening to? 
ERICA 
I don't care... (listens) Oy. Marvin Gaye. . . Erica turns on the garbage disposal. Zoe sings along, "Let's get it on". .., Erica shoots her a look, turns off the garbage disposal, doing the dishes with vigor. 
ERICA 
I know she'll never see him after this weekend. She can't commit either. Then they hear Marin GIGGLING. 
ZOE 
He does sound fun. Marin YELPS. 
ZOE 
Admit it, he's got something. You felt it, right? Then they hear Marin SCREAM. 
ERICA 
Oh, this is nuts... Erica covers her ears with her hands. Then they hear Marin SCREAM "MOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!" 
ERICA 
Did she say, Mom? 
INT. MARIN'S ROOM - ANGLE - THE DOOR 
Erica and Zoe bust into the room and find Harry .on the floor, leaning against the bed, a clenched fist on his chest. His shirt is open, he's sweating, his complexion is grey. Marin stands back, freaked out, afraid to get near him. 
MARIN 
We were fooling around and he said he felt funny Hthen he just collapsed. 
ARRY 
(out of breath) It's nothing. I'm okay maybe it was the lobster... 
ERICA 
Does your chest hurt? 
HARRY 
Like an elephant's standing on it. 
ERICA 
(to Marin) Call 911...tell them to send an ambulance. . . Marin hesitates. 
ERICA 
Marin! Now! 
HARRY'S POV - THE ROOM 
Spinning. When he shuts his eyes, it goes BLACK. Spinning. BLACK. Spinning. BLACK. He sees Marin, soft in the background, on the phone and Erica coming toward him. He hears Zoe: 
ZOE(O.S.) 
What are you doing? 
ERICA 
(coming closer) Mouth to mouth... 
ON HARRY 
Even in this state he gets that Erica is about to place her. mouth on his. His eyes WIDEN IN HORROR, he reels back. Erica catches this. 
ERICA 
You fucking guy... 
She does it anyway. Her-mouth on his, her breath into his lungs, over and over. Harry's eyes roll back in hi-so head. As. Erica pounds on his chest, we HEAR THE BLARE OF A 
SIREN... 
AND A LOUD CLANG 
As the DOORS to SOUTHAMPTON HOSPITAL FLY OPEN. Paramedics WHEEL Harry through the corridors and into the ER with dizzying speed. Two Nurses jostle Harry OFF the gurney and 
ONTO A BED. 
DR. JULIAN MERCER arrives at Harry's side. Julian is in his early-thirties and has finally just graduated out of the 'you look too young to be a doctor' syndrome. Julian is a man whose goodness makes him sexy. He wears his hair shaggier than you'd expect but then again, this is a Johns Hopkins graduate who chose to live near the beach and work nights. The Nurses place oxygen in Harry's nose, .;hook him up to a heart monitor and connect him to an IV. 
JULIAN 
How we doing here? 
PARAMEDIC #1 
He's had 30 minutes of chest pain, nausea, shortness of breath, blood pressure's 170 over 100, pulse 104, respirations 18... 
JULIAN 
Let's get an EKG. Mr. Langer, I'm Dr. Mercer. Are you in any pain right now? The Nurse wheels over an EKG machine, Julian helps hook it up. 
HARRY 
Feel some pressure in my chest...it's real tight. 
JULIAN 
Can you show me where the pain is? Harry clenches his fist over his sternum. 
JULIAN 
What were you doing at the onset of the pain? 
HARRY 
I was uh, kissing a beautiful... 
JULIAN 
(watching the monitor) Where you having intercourse? 
HARRY 
-- Unfortunately, no. 
JULIAN 
No, whoever got him here so fast should be thanked. Another half hour and I don't know if this would've worked. Marin pats her Mom on the back. 
ERICA 
Oh, man... (realizing it all now) This was...intense. Erica wipes away a tear. Nothing could surprise her more. 
JULIAN 
We're out of the woods. I've given him something to sleep, it might make him a little loopy at first but then it should knock him out. (to Erica) You're Mrs. Langer? 
ERICA 
No, no I'm just... No. I'm Erica Barry. . He was having dinner at our house. I just met him this afternoon. 
JULIAN 
You're Erica Barry? 
ERICA 
Yes. 
JULIAN 
The playwright? 
ERICA 
Yes... 
JULIAN 
What a pleasure. I'm a huge fan. Huge fan. 
ERICA 
Really? Oh, thanks... This is my daughter, Marin, my sister, Zoe... 
Julian says Hi to each then returns his attention fully and devotedly to Erica. Takes her in. 
JULIAN 
Wow. 
CLOSE - A JAPANESE TEA POT 
Julian pours steaming hot tea into 3 paper cups. 
MARIN - CLOSE 
Sitting in the hospital corridor as JULIAN'S HAND ENTERS HER FRAME and hands her a cup of tea. She looks up at him with more adorableness than most men could handle. She blows on 
M 
the steam. 
ARIN 
Thanks. Camera Pans to ZOE. Sitting next to Marin. She is also handed a Cup of Tea. Even she softens as she looks up at Julian. 
ZOE 
Thank you Doctor. This is all beginning to feel a little like the Step Sisters trying on the Glass Slipper. Until we get to Erica, not paying any attention at all as she is handed her Tea. 
ERICA 
Oh. . .Hey. . .Ew. . .Hot. Thanks. 
JULIAN 
(eyes on Erica) You're welcome. May I join you? 
ERICA 
Yeah. Sure. This is very nice of you. 
JULIAN 
First year of medical school you learn what can keep you up all night without making you nuts. Green Tea beats everything plus it's a great antioxidant. Cheers. 
MARIN 
(turning on the charm) So, urn, do you always work nights? 
JULIAN 
Usually two or-three a week, gives me a chance for a real life during the day. . . (immediately turns back to Erica) You know, I heard you had a place in the Hamptons. I really am a very big fan. I honestly think I've seen every play you've ever written. 
ERICA 
I think some were written before your time. There are some Marin's never even seen. 
JULIAN 
No, I'm pretty sure I've seen them all and I saw the last one twice. Zoe nudges Erica as a Nurse enters from the ER. 
NURSE 
Doctor, we've got a walk in, may need stitches. . . 
JULIAN 
(rises) I'll check on MI. Langer...if he's asleep; you all might want to get some shut eye and come back in the morning. Great to meet you Erica. Ladies. . . The Women wave and watch him exit. The second he's gone: 
ERICA 
(to Marin) Okay, now that's a perfect a guy for you. He's adorable. 
MARIN 
Mother! I've never seen a man less interested in me. 
ZOE 
Or more interested in you. 
ERICA 
Me? He's thirty years old. 
MARIN 
No, he's older than that. 
ZOE 
Who cares how old, he is. I mean, he's not my type, he's like a gorgeous wholesome doctor but, he's perfect for you and hot for you, which makes him really perfect. 
ERICA 
Stop it. He likes my work. Not me. (they just stare at her) It's insane. I would never. (off Zoe's look) Shut. Up. Just then, Harry stumbles into the corridor in his Hospital 
Z 
Gown, pretty out of it. 
HARRY 
Girls... .my Doctor, Julian Mercer. (then) Honey, did you bring the CDs? Kim hands Harry a shopping bag full of CDs. 
HARRY 
(to Julian) These are for you... (to the Girls) The man loves Hip Hop. 
JULIAN 
(checking out the bag) Maybe not this much but... 
HARRY 
And did you bring the other thing? Lexi hands Harry another bag. Harry reaches in and pulls out a small leather box, hands it to Julian. 
HARRY 
This is just to thank you for your brilliance the other night. I hope it suits you. 
JULIAN 
(opening the box) Wow. This is.. .Jesus, this is the most gorgeous watch I've ever seen. 
HARRY 
- Oh, good. It's a Piaget. (to Girls) He likes it. 
JULIAN 
No, I love it and this is incredibly generous of you but I can't accept it. 
HARRY 
You save my life and you end up with some CDs? 
JULIAN 
No, I end up seeing you walk out of here and I do get paid you know - 
MARIN (O.S.) 
-- Knock, knock. 
T 
hey all turn, see Marin at the door. She waves to Harry, more reserved than normal. 
JULIAN 
Harry, I'll see you on the way out. 
LOWELL 
(whispers) We'll pull up the car. Everyone EXITS leaving Marin and Harry alone. Harry sits on the bed. Marin joins him. Harry places his hand on her thigh. All she notices is his hospital bracelet. 
HARRY 
So, I'm some great date, huh? 
MARIN 
Yeah... Mr. Excitement. 
HARRY 
Tell me somethin', we haven't actually had sex yet, have we? 
MARIN 
No we haven't. You're correct on that one. 
HARRY 
Something to live for. Marin smiles, kisses Harry on the cheek. 
HARRY 
Down to the cheek. (that's big, he digests that one) Come on, let's get outta here. 
EXT. SOUTHAMPTON HOSPITAL - DAY 
Harry is wheeled out in a wheelchair, Marin and a Nurse on either side. In the parking lot is a Town Car with Lowell and the Girls standing next to it. Next to them is Erica, waiting by her car. She's on her cell phone. Harry spots them and tries to get out of the wheel chair before it stops. 
NURSE 
Hold on Tarzan, we're still movin' ... (she stops) Okay, now slow-ly. To prove her wrong, Harry rises quickly. Everyone stands by, ready to help. 
HARRY 
Look at these faces. Will you tell them I'm fine. As soon as Harry spots Erica, he starts to wobble. 
ERICA 
Whoa! Whoa! WHOA! Everyone grabs for Harry as he FALLS OUT OF FRAME AND THE 
SCREEN GOES BLACK. 
CLOSE ON JULIAN 
taking Harry's pulse as Harry lies on the ASPHALT OF THE HOSPITAL PARKING LOT. Lowell, the Two Assistants and Marin huddle around. Erica steps back a bit. 
JULIAN 
Harry, I'm sorry, but I think we jumped the gun.. .can't let you travel quite yet. 
HARRY 
I ain't goin' back in there. 
JULIAN 
You don't have to but I can't put you in a car right now and I can't leave you in the parking lot. I'd like you to stay nearby for a few days and let me keep an eye on you 'til you get your strength back. 
HARRY 
Doc, I'm out in the middle of the Hamptons. Where do you want me to go? Marin turns to Erica who very clearly mouths, "FORGET IT!" 
EXT. ERICA'S HOUSE - LATER THAT DAY. 
The Town Car sits in the driveway, Lexi leans on the hood, talking on her cell. A Market Delivery Van pulls away as a Drugstore Delivery Van pulls in. A Flower Delivery KID holding a large bouquet, knocks at the front door. 
I 
NT. THE GUEST BEDROOM - SAME TIME 
Harry sits up in bed wearing silk pajamas, holding an unlit cigar, and is on the phone. Zoe enters, placing the new bouquet on the already flower filled dresser. Lowell lifts a LUNCH TRAY off the bed as Kim stands nearby on the cell phone. Marin packs her bag. 
HARRY 
(into phone) Just promise me you won't make a decision until we talk. Thinking about it ain't promising me. Okay, man, I'm seein' you Friday... (hangs up, then to Lowell) Lowell, what was that? 
LOWELL 
(looking down at the Tray) Your lunch. 
HARRY 
She never changes... 
ERICA 
(setting him straight) Yes. Maybe that's a good thing. 
EXT. ERICA'S HOUSE - SUNSET 
No cars are out front. Quiet and peaceful. On the Soundtrack we hear the French tune, I wish You Love sung in French. 
INT. ERICA'S KITCHEN - THE SAME TIME - MUSIC OVER 
Erica cooks, softly singing along in French. 
HARRY (O.S.) 
Smells great in here. Surprised, Erica turns to find Harry leaning in the doorway in his pajamas, robe and slippers. No one's ever had more gorgeous clothes to sleep in. His presence disarms her. 
ERICA 
Coq au Vin... (he looks confused) 
H 
Chicken cooked in red wine... 
ARRY 
French Food... French music... 
ERICA 
Part of my play takes place in Paris so I'm hoping this helps me think. I'm hopin'...How you feeling? 
HARRY 
Well, I walked all the way in here, only bumping into two chairs and an ottoman. 
ERICA 
Everyone bumps into that ottoman. Harry appreciates the thought. Before it has time to become awkward, the Phone RINGS. 
HARRY 
Hey, thanks for letting me... 
ERICA 
Yeah, no...it's fine. (answering the phone) Hello. Yes, he is. (hands the phone to Harry) 
HARRY 
(into phone) Hello. Hey sweets... (Erica hates this) Oh, you got the flowers? Are they pretty? Erica can't stand this. She puts on her glasses and skims her recipe. 
HARRY 
Hey, can I call you in a little bit. What's your number doll? (spots a pad and pencil) Harry squints, can't see what he's writing...backs his head away from the pad. Erica hands him her glasses. 
HARRY 
(slips them on, jots down the number) Okay... Call you in a little. 
Harry hangs up and hands the glasses back to Erica. 
HARRY 
Same prescription... 
ERICA 
Look, Harry, it's not like in any stretch of the imagination, I think you're all that right for my daughter but I don't really appreciate hearing you on the phone with other women. It's like I'm an accomplice to you cheating, it's... 
HARRY 
Your daughter knows I see other women. 
ERICA 
She does? I mean, fine, it's none of my business...but... (struggles to open a bottle of wine) 
HARRY 
She knows I'm not monogamous...We've discussed it. 
ERICA 
Great? And that's what? Why are you proud of that? 
HARRY 
Not proud. Just honest. Your daughter said she likes that about me. (takes the wine and opens it with ease.) 
ERICA 
My daughter is confused when it comes to men. 
HARRY 
I don't blame her. We're confusing. Harry hands her the open wine bottle. 
EXT. BEACH PATIO 
WIDE SHOT - ALMOST NIGHT 
Erica and Harry sit not so close together at a long table, under a purple sky. Another French Tune plays. If this wasn't them, this would look romantic. 
N 
othing is said. Just two people eating. Harry lifts the salt shaker, about to add salt to his chicken. 
ERICA 
Should I just call the ambulance now? Harry shoots her a look and places the salt shaker back on the table. 
EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT - OVER - LOUIS ARMSTRONG'S LA VIE EN ROSE 
A starry sky gives the house a storybook setting. We HEAR THE 
PHONE RING. 
INT. ERICA'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME - MUSIC CONTINUES 
Erica works at a laptop at a cluttered table. The CLOCK tells us it's a little after ONE A.M. Annoyed by the ringing phone, she points her remote at the CD Player and stops' the song. Harry answers the phone in his room. A moment of quiet. Erica points her remote, starts the song again, starts typing again. Now the other line RINGS. She looks over at the phone watching one RED LIGHT "BLINK, while the other line is answered. 
ERICA 
What am I doing? She throws a piece of paper over the phone so she can't see it. She clicks on her AOL ICON and is told: AOL CANNOT CONNECT. LINE BUSY. She's pissed. Then, worse, she SMELLS something. 
INT. HARRY'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME 
Harry is on the phone, smoking a cigar. His pajama top is unbuttoned, his hair is allover the place. His bed is a mess, laptop open, newspapers spilling onto the floor. Erica stands in the doorway. He quickly hides his cigar. 
HARRY 
(into phone) Can you hold a see, doll? (looks to Erica) Hey. 
ERICA 
ERICA (O.S.) 
Back here??? 
HARRY 
I-I got confused..! It was dark. I didn't really see anything. Just your tits and a little of your- Erica SLAMS HER DOOR. Photos on the wall shake. 
HARRY 
This is gonna be murder. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - THE NEXT MORNING 
A very wide MIDDLE AGED NURSE gruffly crosses thru the room toward the Front Door. Just as she opens the door, Erica ENTERS in hat, sunglasses, turtleneck, long skirt. Pretty much no skin is showing whatsoever. She carries a few packages. 
NURSE 
Good bye Mrs. Barry. 
ERICA 
Good bye? You're leaving? That's not good. 
NURSE 
Been fired. 
ERICA 
Fired?   You just started. 
HARRY 
Not fired darlin'. Just not needed. Erica hardly looks at You Know Who who appears to be fresh out of the shower, wet hair, silk robe, bare chest and legs. 
ERICA 
What do you mean, not needed? Of course we need her. She's gonna take care of you and feed you and... 
HARRY 
-- No, no, I'm actually feeling pretty perky today. Making quite a recovery. . . (opening the screen door) Sorry for the trouble Mrs. Gimble... Take care, dear. Harry hands her a wad of bills like she's a Maitre'd. Mrs. Gimble gives Erica a look of pity as she exits. Erica, now alone with Harry, self-consciously adjusts her sunglasses. Harry, on the other hand, slips his hand onto his bare chest, pats it. 
HARRY 
Listen, about last night. 
ERICA 
Yeah. How 'bout we never talk about that? (hands him some pills) I was at the drugstore. Your prescriptions were ready. They said take these two with food and this one without. 
HARRY 
Honestly, you were in silhouette. 
ERICA 
I think that's talkin' about it. 
HARRY 
I really didn't see all that much. 
ERICA 
(heading toward her room) Yip. There you go. 
HARRY 
Okay. Won't mention it again but... 
ERICA 
(almost out of the room) Goin' to work, Harry. 
HARRY 
(yells) You saw my ass, you don't see me acting nuts, wearing hats and glasses and weird get ups... The Sound of a DOOR SLAM. - Harry flinches. 
INT. HARRY'S BEDROOM 
Harry and Julian sit on the bed. Julian takes Harry's blood pressure. 
HARRY 
Yes or no. What's the deal, can I go? 
JULIAN 
You still getting dizzy? 
HARRY 
Not as much. 
JULIAN 
Out of breath? 
HARRY 
Only sometimes. 
JULIAN 
(listens with stethoscope) How's Erica treating you? 
HARRY 
Who? 
JULIAN 
(nods toward Living Room) Erica. . . 
HARRY 
Her? Oh, she's a major piece of work. The woman wears turtlenecks in the middle of the summer. 
HARRY (CONT'D) 
She's beyond uptight. Almost makes her fun to be around. 
JULIAN 
Uptight? That's funny. I haven't noticed that. 
HARRY 
Try livin' with her. Julian takes Harry's pulse. 
HARRY 
(with secret glee) I actually saw her naked last night. 
JULIAN 
HARRY 
(quickly) I don't think so. I'm not excited about anything. Erica shifts, the hem of her skirt RISING even higher. 
JULIAN 
There it goes again. Racing. 
HARRY 
Doc... Impossible! Erica rises, leaving Harry's eye-line. 
JULIAN 
Oh, there we go, now I feel better. Back to normal. Harry winces then rises, looks to Erica as she throws a pashmina over her shoulders in SLOW MOTION. Harry rushes them 
OUT THE DOOR. 
HARRY 
Okay, all right, good, have fun, don't rush back for me and don't do anything I wouldn't do. 
ERICA 
Well that wouldn't leave us too many options would it? 
HARRY 
And do we wonder how she writes that snappy repartee. (whispers to Erica) Let him pick up the check. It'll make him feel older. On Erica's shocked expression, the DOOR SLAMS. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT - A BEN WEBSTER CD PLAYS 
Harry lies on the sofa. CAMERA MOVES UP Harry's body, past the hospital take out carton on his stomach and finally up to 
M 
his face. As the CAMERA moves we HEAR: 
ARIN (O.S.) 
Hi, it's Marin, I'm not in so leave a message and I'll call you back. 
HARRY 
Hey, it's me...just sitting around looking at your baby pictures... Thinking about you... 
He hangs up, dials another number. 
ANOTHER YOUNG WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) 
Hi and HI, you've reached Brooke and Shannon. For Brooke push one, for - Harry hangs up then slowly sits up, letting himself feel as funky as he wants. 
HARRY 
Everybody's out but old Har.. .Old, old old old Har... Harry rises dizzily, crosses to the bookshelves. He rummages around, finds ERICA'S SCRAPBOOK, pulls it out, randomly opens it, finds a photo of Erica in the 70's, wearing a turtleneck. Harry smiles. 
INT. ERICA'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Harry wanders in with the scrapbook tucked under his arm. He notices a bowl filled with white beach stones. Harry's brown stone sits at the top of the pile. 
HARRY 
(complimented) Top of the heap... 
CLOSE ON JULIAN 
Staring at Erica. He can't get enough of her. They're in a ROMANTIC SEASIDE RESTAURANT. And Erica's blushing for the first time in twenty-five years. 
ERICA 
-- So, when the land came up, I snatched it and the house was built in record time and... (blushing to death) It's like a thousand degrees in here. 
JULIAN 
You know, they say doctors fall for people who need rescuing, that we have a need to take care of someone. 
ERICA 
Really? I never heard that one. (starts fanning herself with the menu) Julian, how old are you, like... 
JULIAN 
-- Thirty-three. 
ERICA 
Thirty-three.-Okay, so, I'm twenty years older than you. More than twenty years older than you. 
JULIAN 
You look fabulous. 
ERICA 
Thank you   but you know, I'm not sure where you   were headed with that thing you were just   saying, but in terms of us, you just want   to be friends, right? 
JULIAN 
Honestly? No. 
ERICA 
Well, then, what is it that you... want to be? 
J 
ULIAN 
I think I'd embarrass you if I told you. 
ERICA 
I was embarrassed just getting dressed to see you. 
JULIAN 
This may surprise you but some women consider me quite the guy. I've never been married. I'm a doctor. You wouldn't believe what catnip that is for some women. 
ERICA 
Oh yes I would. But, you don't like girls your own age? 
JULIAN 
I do very much. But I've never met one I've taken to quite like this and when something happens to you that's never happened to you before, don't you have to at least find out what it is? 
ERICA 
I suppose but, see, I don't date all that much or all that well... 
JULIAN 
Oh, come on, you must beat them away with a stick. 
ERICA 
Now you're kidding, right? No, guys my age, the ones I've met...well, I'm not that regular a person and they really like regular. 
HARRY 
Okay. 
ERICA 
I mean, if you had an opinion, I'd be curious but...' 
HARRY 
will you tell me first why you only miss being married at night? 
ERICA 
(cracking eggs) Oh, 'cause the phone doesn't ring as much at night and the "alone" thing happens at night and sleeping by myself took some getting used to. But I got the hang of it. You gotta sleep in the middle of the bed. It's absolutely not healthy to have a side when no one has the other side. She starts mixing the batter. 
HARRY 
Okay, now I'm convinced what I think of you is right. (Erica waits. . . ) You are a tower of strength. 
ERICA 
(shoulders sagging) Ughhhhhhhhhh... . 
HARRY 
Try not to rate my answer. 
ERICA 
I'm sorry. It's just...I'm sorry. 
HARRY 
You're like a thoroughbred in a world of mutts. No, you know what you are, you're like a great portrait over a fireplace. Words have been invented to describe women like you. 
ERICA 
( fearful) Such as? 
HARRY 
Flinty   and...Impervious. 
ERICA 
So you think I'm inhuman. 
HARRY 
No. I think you're formidable. 
ERICA 
But cold and distant. Like I'm frozen in some painting... 
HARRY 
Not at all. I think you're strength defines you. (sees how sensitive she is) But it's thrilling when your defenses are down arid you're not isolated. That, I believe, is your winning combo. A killer combo actually. 
ERICA 
... So I can't decide if you hate me or if maybe you're the only person who ever got me. 
HARRY 
I don't hate you. The moment is broken when they HEAR the FRONT DOOR OPEN and 
HIGH HEELS APPROACHING. 
ERICA 
Hello? Marin ARRIVES IN THE DOORWAY in a knockout of a dress holding a bag from Zabars. She looks fresh, vibrant, sexy. 
MARIN 
Room service! 
ERICA 
What are you doing here at this hour? 
Erica and Harry have the air of kids caught making out by one of their parents. Harry straightens out his pajamas, smooths down his hair. Erica catches all this. 
MARIN 
(enters, kisses Erica) 
I 
had this big photography auction tonight, then I went out with a bunch of people, I checked my messages and got this so sad message from Harry so bored out here. I thought I should come out and at least see how he was doing. (kisses Harry on the cheek) Thank you for the gorgeous flowers by the way. They were so huge... Erica nods to herself. Oh, God, he sends them all flowers. Harry notes Erica's reaction. 
MARIN 
So how are you guys? (sets down the Zabar's bag) Oh, this is too sweet. You're making pancakes? Awwww. And you're both in your pj's. Now I feel I'm interrupting. 
ERICA 
Don't be silly. You know I never sleep and this one doesn't sleep either. It's... .What's in the bag? 
MARIN 
(reaches into the bag) A quart of matzoh ball soup for Harry. I know it's not the remedy for heart problems but it is low cholesterol. 
ERICA 
(hating to correct her) But high sodium. 
MARIN 
Oh, sorry. Stupid. For Mom, your favorite raisin-bread. And for me... (reaches into the bag) My favorite Vodka. Marin's cell phone RINGS. 
MARIN 
(into phone) Hello? No I'm here, babe. Made record time. Everyone's still there? Erica feeling suddenly frumpy, fixes her hair. Harry watches her. She catches him and shrugs. Marin flips her phone shut and tosses it in her purse. 
ERICA 
So, Mar, now that you're here, why don't you finish the pancakes and I'll get back to work... 
MARIN 
Mom! I just got here, hold on. She pours a healthy Vodka into a glass, grabs some ice. 
MARIN 
So your ex-husband stood me up today. We were supposed to have lunch at Barneys . He never showed up. Was he always like this? 
ERICA 
Honey, I don't know... 
MARIN 
This is what happens after a couple gets divorced, the kid inherits all the problems. Not that I'm a kid. (then to Harry, the flirt in her coming back) So how are you, how do you feel? When can you go home? Just as harry is about to answer, Marin's cell RINGS. She picks it up, looks at her caller ID, throws it back in her bag. 
ERICA 
ERICA 
(into the phone) Hello. 
HARRY 
(from the beach) Thought you'd like to know your daughter broke up with me. Harry and Erica talk while looking at each other through the Kitchen Window. 
ERICA 
I heard. 
HARRY 
Made up a story about meeting another guy. Guess I wasn't so cute with an IV in my arm. 
ERICA 
No, I think she really did meet someone else. 
HARRY 
Hey, it's alright. Her mother didn't like me anyway. 
ERICA 
(smiles) How 'bout I bring you out some lunch and a couple of blood 
H 
pressure pills? 
ARRY 
You're a great woman, Erica. (Erica relaxes) Is this why my doctor is falling in love with you? 
THE BEACH - MUSIC OVER 
Erica and Harry sit on a blanket on a cloudy day having a picnic lunch. Harry is telling Erica a story and she screams with laughter. 
BROWN STONES IN THE SAND - MUSIC CONTINUES 
Erica picks them up as.she walks with Harry by the water's edge. They talk non-stop. 
A LITTLE LATER - LIGHTNING STREAKS THE SKY 
Out of nowhere, a downpour. Erica and Harry gather their picnic things. The blanket starts to fly and Harry grabs it as Erica runs after a plate spinning away in the wind. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Erica and Harry, wet from the rain, quickly shut all the doors and windows. Lightning crackles across the sky and THE 
LIGHTS IN THE HOUSE GO OUT. 
A MATCH IS STRUCK 
and a CANDLE is lit. Then ANOTHER ONE, and ANOTHER ONE. Erica turns and finds Harry just looking at her. Before either of them has time to think, they kiss. 
ERICA 
I'm sorry. 
HARRY 
(truly confused) For what? 
ERICA 
I just kissed you. 
HARRY 
No, honey, I kissed you. Relieyed, Erica kisses him. 
ERICA 
I know that one was me. 
HARRY 
Try not to keep score. He kisses her again and again. 
HARRY 
Soft lips... 
ERICA 
I'm so glad they still work. I haven't used them for kissing in so long. They've been more like for wearing lipstick and whistling and... He kisses her quiet. Relieved, she finally fully kisses him back. A big gorgeo~s kiss. 
HARRY 
Well, well, now look who's got something that works... They both look down at Harry. Hello, Mr. Midnight. 
ERICA 
And you didn't even take Via- 
HARRY 
(puts his finger on her lips) Kiss me before you make it go away. 
S 
he kisses him long and sweet. 
ERICA'S BED 
They're kissing on it. The rain pelts against the windows as the sun goes down. 
HARRY 
This could be world class interesting. (Erica nods) Having any doubts? 
ERICA 
(as they kiss) Yes. 
HARRY 
Me too. 
ERICA 
But so far the kissing is spectacular. (He looks at her) I'm not grading you, just mentioning it. Brilliant. He tries to kiss her neck but the turtleneck is in the way. He pulls it down, but it's tight and it's, difficult to get to her. 
HARRY 
Can't get past your damn turtleneck. . . He tries lifting the shirt from the bottom, it's awkward, he doesn't want to be down there yet. He comes back up when Erica reaches to her night table, slides opens the drawer, takes out a SCISSORS and hands it to him. 
ERICA 
(breathless) Cut it off... Please. What a brilliant invitation. He takes the scissors and starts cutting from the bottom, right past her belly, up her torso, between her breasts. The turtleneck falls open from the center. When he reaches her neck, he gently tears at it and it easily rips apart and there she is. He takes her in. 
HARRY 
You're beautiful. She shakes her head, 'no' ...shuts her eyes. 
MARIN 
What do you mean, it's like a hurricane. The news said the winds are like a zillion miles an hour. 
ERICA 
Oh, that. Oh, no, we're fine... 
MARIN 
Are you having sex? Tell the truth. You are, aren't you. 
ERICA 
Absolutely not. No. That is not going on now. 
MARIN 
Oh my God, you already did it. Was it amazing? 
ERICA 
I have to go. 
MARIN 
Just tell me, was it amazing? 
ERICA 
Yes and thank you for the wonderful opportunity. Marin SCREAMMMMMMMMMMMS. Erica flips the phone shut, looks to Harry, embarassed. 
ERICA 
(to Harry) Am I interested in buying aluminum siding. . . 
HARRY 
Really? Marin's selling aluminum siding? Erica buries her face in his chest. 
LATER 
Harry and Erica SIT ON STOOLS AT THE KITCHEN ISLAND, drinking wine and eating scrambled eggs right out of the pan. Candles light the room. 
HARRY 
--But why Paris? 
ERICA 
I just always wanted to write a play that ended there. 
ERICA (CONT'D) 
People need romance like that. And if someone like me doesn't write it, where they gonna get it? Real life? 
HARRY 
(slightly insulted) Excuse me. What do you call this? Eating eggs by candlelight in our robes after... She kisses him, starts to say, "I'm sorry" when he pulls her back, kisses her again, then looks at her hard, perplexed. 
CLIMBING BACK UNDER THE COVERS 
HARRY 
So where do you like to eat in Paris?    E 
RICA 
Oh, I love this place called Le Balzar, it's just a little bistro on the Left Bank, best roast chicken in the universe. 
HARRY 
You'd be fun to go to Paris with. 
ERICA 
It's a great city to stay up all night in. (then) When's your birthday? 
HARRY 
February. 
ERICA 
Mine's in January. So, how 'bout if we still know each other by then we go to Paris for our birthdays. 
HARRY 
(a beat, then) Maybe. . . 
ERICA 
Oh. Sorry. You just... (sees the look on his face) . I have no idea how to do this...be intimate but not...The color is draining from your face. Okay, look, I'm gonna pee,take one of your blood pressure pills then when I get back, let's not talk anymore. 
She gets out of bed. 
HARRY 
You're the funniest girl I ever had sex with. She has no idea how to take that. Decides to accept it. 
ERICA 
That's somethin'... 
HARRY 
Honey... ? She turns, sees he's getting out of bed, approaching her. 
HARRY 
I think I'm gonna go back to my room...let you sleep. 
ERICA 
Let me sleep? Oh, right...you usually send the girls home. . .but I am home... so...okay. 
HARRY 
I'm an old dog, you' know. 
ERICA 
Hey, it's perfectly. .. whatever. Good night. This was..This was a great night. For me... 
HARRY 
Me too. At one point I even thought soul mates, you know... Erica nods. She knows. 
HARRY FLOPS ONTO HIS BED 
stares straight up at the ceiling. 
INT. ERICA'S ROOM - SAME TIME 
Erica gets back in her bed. She lies there for a second,securing her armor back in place. She routinely moves to the middle of the bed,neatens out the covers and shuts her eyes. Then a small KNOCK on her open door. She sees Harry in the doorway. 
HARRY 
Yeah and totally changing their tastes. Like suddenly really liking something they never thought they could like...ever...and I'm talking really liking it. It's...unnerving. 
JULIAN 
I think you can expect just about anything right now. People have done some wild things after having a heart attack...selling businesses, getting divorced, moving... Some people say it saved their lives. 
HARRY 
But most people go back to being themselves, right? I'll go back to being me, won't I? 
J 
ULIAN 
We'll see. 
ERICA - TYPING - HER PHONE RINGS 
She wears a blouse with more buttons unbuttoned than ever in her life. She picks up the phone. 
HARRY DRIVES ERICA'S CAR, TOP DOWN. 
HARRY 
(on his cell) Hi. 
ERICA 
Hey.    What'd he say? 
HARRY 
He said you're wonderful. 
ERICA 
No, really, what'd he say...How are you? 
HARRY 
He said I'm good..that I can go. 
. ERICA 
(obviously conflicted) Oh. So... Congratulations. That's really. . . great. 
HARRY 
Yeah, he said... by tomorrow for absolute sure. You think you can deal with me for one more night? 
A CROWDED CLUB - SOUTHAMPTON - THAT NIGHT 
Packed with Young People. In the middle of this twentysomething sun burnt beach crowd, we find, Erica and Harry, the two coolest people in the room, dancing with each other. 
A LITTLE 'LATER - THE KARAOKE ROOM 
Harry leads Erica through a crowd listening to a Girl singing Britney Spears' Oops, I Did It Again. When she finishes the crowd enthusiastically applauds. 
HARRY 
(big breath) Okay, here goes... 
ERICA 
Here goes what? 
HARRY 
Here goes me singing to you... (pulling a DISC out of his pocket) Bought my own music. 
ERICA 
You knew they had karaoke? 
HARRY 
Baby, it's why we're here. . Harry makes his way TO THE STAGE, hands them his disc. He's handed a microphone. He looks right at Erica. 
HARRY 
This is for you, Ace... (then, under his breath) wish me luck. The Music begins and it is an instrumental version of one of Erica's French Songs, "I Wish You Love". 
HARRY 
(sings) I wish you bluebirds in the spring... To Give your heart a song to sing... And then a kiss, but more than this... I wish H         you love... arry takes out a sheet of paper and his glasses. 
HARRY 
Don't want to blow this part... Now Harry sings the rest of the song IN FRENCH. . . 
HARRY 
(sings) Et en juillet une limonade...Pour vous refroidir dans quelque lefy glade... And so on... Erica watches knowing something in her life has just that second, forever changed. And as Harry continues singing, we: 
CUT TO: 
LOWELL - THE NEXT DAY 
Packing the Trunk of the Town Car in front of Erica's house. 
INT. HARRY'S ROOM - SAME TIME 
Harry tosses his pills in a leather bag. .. Erica enters doing the worst job she's ever done of being strong. 
ERICA 
(holding some cigars) Here you go, you can have these back now. (Harry looks confused) I confiscated them your first night here... 
HARRY 
(smells them) Thank you darlin' ... 
ERICA 
Try not to smoke them... (hands him a small bag) And I packed you a sandwich, just in case your blood sugar got low. And some of that iced-tea you like, and a nonfat, low cholesterol cookie. And a peach. 
HARRY 
what a doll... (notices) Got something else? From behind her back Erica pulls out a Mason Jar filled with all dark beach stones with ONE WHITE STONE in the center. 
ERICA 
Something to remember me by. Harry hugs her. Erica awkwardly throws her arms around him and kisses him, then kisses him better. He's moved by her. 
HARRY 
There is that... 
ERICA 
And hey, we'll always have Paris. 
HARRY 
Honey, no words can ever express my gratitude for taking me in and taking care of me and... 
ERICA 
Absolutely not. No. 
MARIN 
Please. He wants me to meet her and I can not go alone. I already asked him if you could come and he said it was fine and she said it was fine. Look, you're gonna have to meet her too, so, we might as well meet her together. Come on, you know you can handle it. 
Erica pauses, thinks M about it. She knows she can too. 
ARIN 
Okay. That's it. See that look on your face. That's the gene I didn't get. 
INT. SOTHEBY' S - MOMENTS LATER 
Marin, now all pulled together, stands at the podium in front of a packed house. If' you didn't know, you'd never guess. 
MARIN 
Good evening and welcome to Sotheby's and this evening's sale of Impressionistic and Modern Art. Bidders should know that the auctioneer may open bidding on any lot below the reserve by placing a bid on behalf of the seller. Okay...Let's start with Lot I, the Bonnard drawing. And $5.000 starting with my bidders, $5000 is bid, 5500, 6000, 6500 is mine, 7000 gentleman's bid, 7500 is here, 8000 on the phone. . . 
ON ERICA 
in the back of the room, watching with pride and worry. She slips out her cell, checks her messages. Her phone lights up and tells her she has "0" Voice Mail. 
A CLOCK ON THE WALL - IT'S 8:30 
We are in ERICA'S EMPTY KITCHEN in The Hamptons and her phone is RINGING. 
ANGLE - A CELL PHONE 
as A Man's HAND turns it off. We are: 
INT. HAMPTON'S RESTAURANT 
Julian sits at a table, by himself, in a coat and tie, tucking away his phone. The Waiter sympathetically approaches the table. 
JULIAN 
Guess I got stood up. 
WAITER 
Would you like to order or...? 
JULIAN 
Why not, I put. on the tie and everything. And can you bring me another. . . (indicating his drink) Julian takes a look at the menu, then looks away. 
TWO DINNER PLATES ARE CARRIED THROUGH THE RESTAURANT 
and as the CAMERA WIDENS we realize we are: 
IN A CHIC CAFE IN MANHATTAN - LATER THAT NIGHT 
Camera takes us to Erica, Marin, Dave and DAVE'S FIANCE, KRISTEN, a combo of a hot tie and a young professional. Everyone has menus and drinks. A Waiter delivers two new Martinis for Marin and Erica. They both go right for them. Erica drinks too much too fast.                D 
AVE 
(to Erica) Thirsty? 
ERICA 
I've had a big week Dave, forgot how these slip right down. I'm fine. So, Kristen, where'd you go to... (burps) --medical school? Excuse me. 
KRISTEN 
University of Pennsylvania. 
ERICA 
I went to school in Philadelphia too. 
DAVE 
Bryn Mawr girl. 
KRISTEN 
That's amazing. My Mom went to Bryn Mawr . . . 
MARIN 
Wow. So not only are you marrying my father but our mothers went to the same college. Marin takes out a pack of cigarettes. 
MARIN 
Anyone mind? 
KRISTEN 
Actually I do. 
MARIN 
Okay, I'll just..have one. (lights up) So, this isn't going badly so far is it? I mean for a totally surreal situation like this. 
DAVE 
Shall we order? 
KRISTEN 
Absolutely. 
DAVE 
(peruses menu) Erica, do I like duck? 
ERICA 
Yes. It's rabbit you hate. (to Kristen) I'll give you a list of everything he likes and dislikes. 
DAVE 
Let's let her figure some things out on her own. 
ERICA 
I didn't mean those things, Dave. She did go to medical school. 
MARIN 
(pointing to herself and Kristen) Hey, not in front of the kids. 
ERICA 
(polishing off her Martini) I will tell you this...Dave has one truly great love in his life. 
KRISTEN 
Really? What's that? 
ERICA 
His balls. 
DAVE 
I have never lied to you. I have always told you some version of the truth. 
ERICA 
(freaking on that one) The truth doesn't have versions. 
HARRY 
Can you cut me a little slack? My life's been turned upside down. 
ERICA 
Yeah. Mine too. 
HARRY 
Then let's each get our bearings. 
ERICA 
I don't want my bearings. I've had my bearings my whole fucking life. I felt something with you that... Oh, you don't want to- 
HARRY 
Yes I do. (she won't open up) Tell me. 
ERICA 
I felt something with you, I didn't know really existed. You know what that's like after a twenty year marriage? To feel something for another person that's so off the charts, that - (Harry looks down) Okay, not your problem. This is why I'm not good in relationships. You know writers are like teachers, those who can - do, those who can't - write romantic comedies where THIS does not happen in the third act...and it certainly does not happen to a 55 year old woman. In the play I'll be 36 so it won't be as pathetic. I'm just too old to feel crushed.I've written this feeling but I never really got it. (realizes) You know what this is? (pointing to herself) This is heart broken. How's that for impervious? 
HARRY 
You're killin' me. 
ERICA 
I just wish it had lasted more than a week. 
HARRY 
Me too. 
ERICA 
That's a horrible thing to say. (walks off, comes back) The life I had before I met you. I knew how to do that, could do that forever. Now look at me...what do I do with all this? 
HARRY 
Can we talk tomorrow? 
ERICA 
What for? I saw your friend you were having dinner with, if that's what you want, it's never going to work with me. Look at me. I'm a middle aged woman, don't let this brown hair fool you, I don't have a real brown hair on my head, I'm almost all grey...that would freak you out, wouldn't it? And I have. high cholesterol and my back hurts every morning and I'm post menopausal and I have osteoperosis and I'm sure arthritis is just around the corner and I know you've seen my vericose veins. Let's face it man, that's not quite the buzz you're lookin' for. A TAXI pulls up. 
ERICA 
And you know what? Everyday, I'm gettin' older. ..just like you. Erica opens the back door of the Taxi. 
HARRY 
Wait. Erica turns. This is his chance. 
HARRY 
I just... the truth is... I don't know how to be a boyfriend. 
ERICA 
That's what you have to say after all this? You don't know how to be a boyfriend. 
HARRY 
That's not a small thing. They're both out of words. 
ERICA 
Are we done? 
HARRY 
I don't know. She nods. He doesn't give. She ducks into the CAB and it PULLS AWAY. Harry stands on the street, watching her go. 
HARRY 
(winces) Ouch. He grabs his heart. 
HARRY 
Oh, God... 
HARRY - ON A GURNEY 
wheeled through the Emergency Room of Beth Israel Hospital. This is not the Hamptons. This place is crawling with patients. Harry's delivered to a Latina Doctor in her thirties, DR. MARTINEZ. As he's taken off the gurney, he's immediately hooked up to a heart monitor, given oxygen and an 
IV. 
NURSE 
Came in by cab, 15 minutes of chest pain, no nauseau, some shortness of breath, was hospitalized a week ago with a coronary thrombosis. 
DR. MARTINEZ 
Hang a nitro drip. 
HARRY 
You can't. I took Viagra. 
DR. MARTIINEZ 
You have been through this before. Give him 5 mgs of Metoprolol. You h~ving chest pain right now? 
H 
ARRY 
No, and the pain I was having was sharp, not like before. 
. DR. MARTINEZ 
That's good. Not like before is we like to hear. (reads EKG) Give him aspirin. 
DR. MARTINEZ (CONT'D) 
Based   on what I see so far, your heart   is not in distress but I'm gonna   do a rapid enzyme test to be sure.    What were you doing at the onset   of the pain? 
HARRY 
Having a fight with someone. A woman. Can a woman give you chest pain? 
DR. MARTINEZ 
Are you kidding? Love hurts, haven't you heard? 
HARRY 
Yeah, but so far, I've only given pain, I never got any. 
LOWELL 
Yes but you gave them to me, you said you never wore them. 
HARRY 
I know. But why would I do that? They're so elegant. Nice piping... 
LOWELL 
Mr. Langer, you're always giving away beautiful things. 
HARRY 
Awwwww... How did I get like this? (eyes fluttering shut) I'm gonna shut my eyes for a few minutes. Keep Lucy on... Harry nods off and Lowell TURNS OUT THE LIGHT. 
EXT. BEACH - THE HAMPTONS - MORNING - MUSIC OVER 
Erica and Zoe are taking a walk. Erica, still crying, picks up a brown stone, explains its meaning to Zoe. Zoe holds the stone, makes an `awwww' face.Erica nods, then Zoe tosses the stone in the ocean, fed up with hearing about him already. Then, Zoe stops Erica, points to something. 
MARIN AND HER NEW BOYFRIEND 
frolicking on the beach. He's a YOUNG HUNK in a tank top, shorts, highlighted hair. Erica rolls her eyes. 
EXT. BEACH STAIRS - DUSK 
Marin rushes down the stairs. Erica sits near the bottom of the stairs, watching the sunset. 
MARIN 
Mom, we're going into town... Erica turns, wiping tears. 
MARIN 
Are you crying? (joining her) I didn't know you did that. 
ERICA 
Yeah, it's my new thing. I've gotten abnormally great at it. 
MARIN 
(sitting on the step with her) Is it Harry? 
ERICA 
Seems I gotta learn how to do that love 'em and leave 'em stuff. 
MARIN 
Fucking men. You don't care when I say fuck, do you? 
ERICA 
Not really. Sometimes. Not right now. 
MARIN 
So now you get my theory about love? You gotta self protect. It's too dangerous. 
ERICA 
Marin, that theory... how can I put this so your feelings won't get hurt. It's just so crazy, it makes me want to SCREAMMMMMMMMMMM!!!! 
MARIN 
And how would you put it if you wanted to hurt my feelings? 
ERICA 
Listen to me... you cannot hide from love for the rest of your life because maybe it won't work out and maybe you'll become unglued. That's not a way to live. 
MARIN 
So you're telling me you're happy right now? This is good what happened to you? 
ERICA 
No. This was bad. But for the three days it was good, it was electrifying. Marin's eyes fill up. 
ERICA 
I think you must consider the possibility that we are more alike than you realize. I let someone in and I had the time of my life. 
MARIN 
(tearful) I've never had the time of my life. 
ERICA 
I know. And bubbee, I say this from the deepest part of my heart. . ... what the fuck are you waiting "for? 
INT. HARRY'S HOUSE - NYC - NIGHT 
A PARTY is in progress. It's loud. The place is crawling with characters from the Hip Hop world. Harry winds his way down his crowded STAIRCASE, Girls grabbing at him as he passes by. As hard as he tries, he can't quite bring to life the guy he knew how to be. 
LOWELL 
(as Harry passes) 
H 
aving fun? 
HARRY 
Not quite. Harry makes his way down the stairs, through the crowded entry and OUT THE FRONT DOOR. OUTSIDE, Harry steps into the QUIET STREET, looks up at his house and the party inside. 
EXT. ROADSIDE FARM STAND - EAST HAMPTON - DAY 
Zoe is picking corn, when she notices Julian across the way. He glances up, looks right past her, obviously doesn't remember her, keeps on shopping. Zoe thinks for a see, wondering how she can get his attention when he looks right back at her, his face full of hope. 
INT. ERICA'S DINING ROOM - LATER 
Erica sets the table for two. Zoe pokes her head in the door. 
ZOE 
I got you something great at the farm stand. 
J 
Zoe fully opens the door revealing Julian holding a bouquet of fresh cut flowers. 
JULIAN 
These are for you to give me when you apologize. 
INT. DINING ROOM - LATER - MUSIC OVER 
Candlelit. Zoe, Erica and Julian share a bottle of wine and a home cooked meal. The CAMERA does a 360 around the table, their faces saying it all. The Women bask in Julian's warmth as he entertains them with stories. Zoe looks from Julian to Erica, relieved to see her sister smiling again. 
INT. KITCHEN - LATER 
Erica places coffee cups in the sink. Julian is next to her, leaning against the counter, holding a glass of wine. 
ERICA 
A Woman In Her Fifties, purposively walks down a SMALL TOWN MAIN STREET carrying groceries. 
Harry, at her side, keeps talking at her, even though she picks up her pace and ignores him. 
HARRY (V.O.) 
My losing streak finally ended when I got one to open up to me. In a HOSPITAL ROOM, an Older Woman on life support, scrawls out a note and shows it to Harry who sits in a chair by herside. A Priest stands in the background. The note says, "As I remember it, you were wildly insensitive". Harry lowers his head in shame. She places another note in front of him. It says, "I forgive you." Relieved, he smiles. Then, one last note: "Now, scram." 
HARRY (V.O.) 
Hearing what they had to say was no picnic. In an Upper West Side COFFEE SHOP, Harry pas coffee with a Woman in her Mid Forties. She talks his ear off. Harry can' t deal with it. He looks away ~ The woman places her hand on his chin and pulls him right back to her and keeps talking at him. 
H 
ARRY (V .O.) 
But I stuck it out and I listened. Then I listened harder. Harry WALKS down THE STREET with a ANOTHER WOMAN in her Thirties, who carries a cello.   She never shuts up. 
HARRY (V. O. ) 
And one of the things I realized was, I was actually giving closure to generations of women. At the corner, the Woman hugs Harry goodbye. 
HARRY (V. O. ) 
Although I admit, some refused to give, no matter what I did. . . 
CLOSE - DIANE SAWYER 
On the set of GOOD MORNING AMERICA. She glances out the STUDIO WINDOW and sees Harry ON THE STREET among the folks holding signs. He HOLDS A SIGN that says, "DIANE, YOU WERE RIGHT.   I WAS ENTIRELY WRONG.   I`M SORRY."   She looks him straight in the eye and gives 'him the finger. 
HARRY - FULLY DRESSED - LYING ON HIS BED - TOP SHOT 
HARRY (V. O. ) 
When you hear the same story about yourself over and over, your life begins to make sense and the future becomes your only salvation. 
INT. PARIS BISTRO - THE PRESENT 
HARRY 
It took me six months to find them all. I visited 18 different states but I came the furthest to see you. A HAND lands on his shoulder and he HEARS: 
A MAN'S VOICE 
I don't believe it. Harry looks up and sees handsome young Julian in a beret. Harry looks to Erica, instantly deflated.. 
HARRY 
Me either. Harry stands. The two Men hug, then Julian squeezes in next to Erica. Harry slowly takes his seat across from them. 
ERICA 
I should have told you he was coming, but I was so engrossed in your story. 
JULIAN 
What story..? 
HARRY 
Oh, maybe another time. ..So... (looks from Erica to Julian, it all dawns on him) I guess I should've seen your play, then I would've Jknown how this ended. 
ULIAN 
Yeah, big twist, huh? So what are you doing over here, man? 
HARRY 
Just a uh, vacation...never been to Paris in January... 
JULIAN 
It's amazing to run into you. You look wonderful. 
ERICA 
You do. 
HARRY 
Haven't been on a gurney in six months so that's somethin'... 
JULIAN 
Well, I've just been to every store in the city, this woman is impossible to buy for... But I think I finally found the right gift. He puts what can only be a RING BOX on the table between Erica and Harry. 
JULIAN 
Happy Birthday baby. He kisses her. Harry watches, dying. 
ERICA 
(reaching for it) I'll open it later... Harry rises, reaches for his coat. 
HARRY 
No, no, you know what, I'll let you two celebrate... 
ERICA 
Harry, stay. 
HARRY 
I can't really. 
JULIAN 
Why? You have somewhere to go? 
DISSOLVE TO: 
THE WAITER POURING THE END OF A WINE BOTTLE 
Everyone at the table is laughing, mid-meal. Julian is doing the talking as well as laughing. Harry laughs along, trying to be an approving part of their romance but he's totally faking it. 
THREE GLASSES OF BRANDY ARE SERVED - A LITTLE LATER 
JULIAN 
-- To the forces of destiny that brought us together tonight. 
Erica lights a cigarette. 
JULIAN 
What are you doing, you don't smoke? 
ERICA 
I'm in Paris, the second hand smoke will kill you anyway... 
JULIAN 
She's very brilliant, but the woman can not hold her liquor. Julian puts his arm around her, pulls her close. 
ERICA

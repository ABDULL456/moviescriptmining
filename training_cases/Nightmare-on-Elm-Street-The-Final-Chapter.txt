Nightmare on Elm Street 6: Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare 
FADE IN: 
INT. DC-10 AIRLINER - NIGHT 
JACOB JOHNSON is sleeping.  It doesn't look like a pleasant experience.  He is sixteen, dirty blonde, his eyes visibly moving under closed lids as he sits huddle under a blanket in his window seat.  The lights are dim -- the shade on the window closed -- a bead of sweat dribbles down his forehead. The HUMMING of the jet's engines vibrates through the cabin. 
The boy's eyes snap open. 
Jacob glances around nervously.  He looks like an escaped convict who just accidentally walked into the Policemen's Ball.  A GREYHAIRED MAN two seats away from him gives the teenager a cursory glance, then goes back to his book.  Jacob lays his head back and tries to relax.  The engines continue to drone. 
Until a new noise starts.  A WHOOSHING NOISE. 
The sound is very faint.  But distinct from everything else. Jacob frowns. 
The noise gets LOUDER.  Jacob's sure he's hearing it now.  He looks at the Greyhaired Man.  The man catches his eye and the two of them stare at each other for a heartbeat - then Jacob turns away.  The Man returns to his book.  And Jacob immediately turns back to him. 
JACOB Do you hear that? 
The man gives him an annoyed look as the WHOOSHING gets louder. 
GREYHAIRED MAN Hear what? 
JACOB That noise. 
GREYHAIRED MAN I don't hear anything. 
The man turns back to the book as the sound gets even LOUDER - - like it's coming closer.  Jacob squirms in his seat -- sneaks a look at the man again.  How can he not hear that?  A STEWARDESS walks by and Jacob catches her attention. 
JACOB Excuse me. 
STEWARDESS Yes? 
The WHOOSHING is completely obvious now.  The greyhaired man tries to ignore the two people talking over him. 
JACOB What is that sound? 
STEWARDESS That's just the engines, sir. 
JACOB No, it's different.  It's not the engines.  It's getting louder. 
The man sighs -- the stewardess smiles patronizingly. 
STEWARDESS We're just gaining altitude to get above some rough weather.  That's the sound of the engines speeding up a bit. Everything's fine. 
JACOB Um...okay. 
The stewardess walks away as Jacob sits back and starts to bite his nails.  The whooshing is really starting to BLARE now.  He looks between the seats in front of him -- twists around to look behind.  He snaps back to the greyhaired man. 
JACOB (cont'd) Can't you hear that? 
GREYHAIRED MAN (losing patience) Look, kid.  Will you relax?  It's just the damn engines, okay? 
The man glares at him, and Jacob backs off.  The sound has grown DEAFENING.  Jacob grinds his seat like he's going mad. He looks at the closed window.  He reaches out his hand, grabs the handle then rips up the shade for all to see: 
A 747 coming RIGHT AT US. 
Jacob SCREAMS.  The planes CRASH. 
Impact - decompression - explosion.  The hull of the cabin buckles violently - moaning like a dying elephant - peeling inward revealing RED AND GREEN STRIPING on the outside. 
A huge wing section RIPS through the structure - barely missing Jacob - taking the greyhaired man's head clean off - nailing the stewardess in the gut and shoving her body across and out the other side of the cabin. 
And Jacob's seat drops down - sending him and us into: 
EXT. SKY - NIGHT 
Like an intricate ballet, Jacob, his body strapped to his chair, tumbles away from the DC-10 and 747 as they seem to merge and bend into some kind of mutant DC-47 - wings and tails wrapping around each other as debris blooms out like a flower and together they EXPLODE - a fiery ball lighting the nighttime clouds and Jacob's shrieking face. 
And Jacob falls and falls and falls, his hair sticking straight up from the blasting wind. 
That's when CORPSES start falling past him.  The captain of the plane - the stewardess, her body bent in half - the greyhaired man, his head gone but his book still in his hand. More men, women, crew people - and CHILDREN. 
But these children aren't dead bodies.  Two LITTLE GIRLS and one LITTLE BOY, all dressed in white, plummet down next to Jacob, head first, like high divers.  And they're singing: 
THE CHILDREN One two, Freddy's coming for you... 
The children turn around in the sky so that they are travelling feet first.  The Little Boy's pants puff up and the Girls' skirts poof out and RIP UPWARD - the wind taking away their clothes and their skin and their bodies and their hair... 
THE CHILDREN (cont'd) Three four, better lock your door... 
Jacob rises out of the destruction, charred, scraped, battered and, unfortunately, alive.  He climbs up to the edge of the crater.  He looks back a the remnants of his home. 
Then something starts to happen. 
Something his growing from the crater - spreading out.  It's not a cloud, it's not smoke - it's a DARKNESS.  Even though it's night, this darkness is darker.  It creeps out from the hole - fingers of blackness reaching out.  What it covers doesn't disappear.  It becomes GLOOMY.  The shroud is getting bigger. 
And it's getting faster.  Jacob runs. 
WITH JACOB - RUNNING 
He bolts down the streets of the small town in a blind panic. He looks behind him and sees the darkness getting bigger, its gloominess covering houses.  Then whole blocks. 
Everything it touches seems to fall deeper into SHADOW. 
AT THE STREET CORNER 
Jacob comes across a WOMAN walking her dog.  He stops and yells at her. 
JACOB Get the hell out of here!  It's coming! 
WOMAN What's coming? 
Jacob points down the street.  The shroud is swooping down the road - browning out street lights in its wake.  And the woman doesn't find anything threatening about this.  Jacob screams at her. 
JACOB Don't you see it? 
WOMAN See what? 
And it's obvious now: she doesn't see anything.  The Woman is totally oblivious to the danger.  Jacob shakes his head -- stumbles away. 
The woman watches him go as the darkness PASSES OVER HER. She sighs. 
And begins to MUTATE.  Her hair gets scraggly, her skin bursts out in sores, her back grows a hump -- all of which she DOESN'T seem to notice. 
She just shrugs her twisted shoulders. 
WOMAN (cont'd) Kids...watcha gonna do? 
She hobbles away with her dog - which now has six legs and two heads. 
BACK WITH JACOB - RUNNING 
Like a bat running from hell, he tears through the streets passing buildings that turn creepy and people that become passively accepting monsters. 
A VOICE booms out from nowhere. 
FREDDY (O.S.) Jacob!  You're too old to run away from home! 
Jacob covers his ears and races out of town. 
EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT 
Jacob falls onto the deserted road just outside of town.  He rolls on the asphalt and looks behind him.  most of the town is covered in an opaque gloom. 
Suddenly a CACKLING sound is heard and Jacob turns to its source: 
HIS POV: THE SPRINGWOOD SIGN 
The town can still be seen behind it -- the darkness over almost all of it now.  The sign reads: WELCOME TO SPRINGWOOD. POPULATION... 
And the numbers after the word "population" are changing. They're counting BACKWARDS, clattering away like an old-time gas pump in reverse - faster and faster - blurring as the "thousands" digit disappears, then the "hundreds", then "tens", then... 
CLINK - the count stops at "1".  Springwood is entirely engulfed in the shroud.  There is a pause. 
CRASH - the sign is violently YANKED into the ground.  It vanishes into the earth and a CRACK APPEARS at the edge of the road. The crack grows - moving out to the center of the highway. 
BACK ON THE STREET 
Jacob watches the crack as it splits wider in the middle of the street and a GURGLING sound starts to build.  The tar in front of Jacob becomes molten.  It bubbles and pops. 
Jacob scrambles backwards as something begins to rise from boiling asphalt. 
It's a hat. 
The hat, a fedora to be precise, pushes itself up. A left hand - burned and scarred - pokes out next to it.  Four sharp blades jut out of the muck on the other side.  A head is up now - a curtain of tar dripping from the rim of the hat - hiding the face.  The body beneath the head ascends.  The veil of asphalt parts: 
It's FREDDY KRUEGER.  Jacob SCREAMS. 
Freddy LAUGHS.  He shakes off his layer of tar and looks towards the clouded town of Springwood.  A look of pure hatred appears on his ragged face. 
FREDDY Payback time... 
He raises his face and looks at the road in front of him.  It goes off into the distance surrounded on both sides by empty fields. 
This is where Springwood used to be.  A look of anguish crosses Jacob's face as he stares at the desolation. 
JACOB Mom... 
HONK!  SCREECH! 
Jacob whips his head around in time to see a huge moving van blasting right at him.  He rolls off to the side of the road. The truck barely misses him, kicking up a cloud of dust in its wake. 
Jacob chokes on the dust.  He slowly recovers and looks back down at the bracelet in his hand. He clenches his fist around it as a wild-eyed angry look starts to grow on him.  He takes a few deep breaths, then stands up and walks OUT OF FRAME. 
ANGLE DOWN THE HIGHWAY 
We can see a pickup truck in the distance. Jacob's HAND ENTERS FRAME, thumb sticking out, his mother's bracelet dangling from his wrist. 
The pickup truck starts to slow down. 
EXT. ROSEDALE - DAY 
A sprawling little community with pleasant streets and cheerful houses.  It looks a lot like Springwood, the only real difference being that it actually exists.  It also has a sign: WELCOME TO ROSEDALE.  POPULATION: 8,786 
A Volkswagon bus drives past the sign and stops a couple of blocks down the road from us.  Jacob steps out of the passenger side and wearily waves his ride goodbye.  He shuffles into town. 
CLOSE ON YET ANOTHER SIGN 
It reads: DRUG ADDICTS NOT WELCOME TO ROSEDALE! 
The sign pulls away to reveal a middle-aged man with an angry expression: MR. HOPKINS 
MR. HOPKINS Clean up your act somewhere else! 
He walks along as we PULL BACK TO SEE 
EXT. ROSEDALE FOSTER HOME - DAY 
It's a nice-looking two-story house in the middle of a usually quiet neighborhood.  Today the home is surrounded by about a dozen townsfolk carrying picket signs: NO HALFWAY HOUSES IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD!, DON'T LOWER OUR PROPERTY VALUES!, and GO BACK TO JUVENILE HALL!  The crowd mumbles amongst itself, occasionally bursting out with a chant in protest. 
ON JACOB 
We catch him walking down the sidewalk.  He tramps along with his hands stuffed in his pockets and his eyes on the pavement.  He looks like he hasn't slept in days.  The sound of the crowd ahead of him finally grabs his attention. 
Jacob approaches the disturbance and comes across a young girl standing behind a bush holding a BAG OF GROCERIES.  She is KAREN MILLER, dark hair, sixteen, very pretty, but with a faraway look in her eyes. 
Jacob stands next to her and stares at the crowd like a zombie.  She doesn't turn to look at him as he speaks: 
JACOB What's going on? 
KAREN Free speech.  The right of assembly. 
JACOB What is this place? 
KAREN It's a home.  A foster home.  For teenagers.  It's where you go when things get bad.  It's the place to figure out what to do next.  It's a home for kids that no one else wants. (beat) It's MY home. 
Karen hasn't looked at Jacob once.  She suddenly seems to steel herself and walks away from the bush, towards the house.  Jacob is befuddled. 
JACOB Oh... 
He stands there and watches. 
IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE 
Karen quickly makes her way into the crowd of people, head up, eyes staring forward.  The crowd parts ever so slightly as the irked townsfolk start to heat up.  They have an actual human to vent their anger on now.  Mr. Hopkins lays in on her as she passes him. 
MR. HOPKINS Why can't you find somewhere else to shack up? 
Karen turns to him, still walking, flustered and hurt. 
KAREN What have we ever done to you? 
MR. HOPKINS Nothing...YET. 
Karen turns quickly away from him and trips over a sprinkler head.  Her groceries tumble onto the grass.  A hand reaches down to help her.  It's Jacob's. 
He quietly helps her re-bag her groceries as Mr. Hopkins looms above them.  Both angry and embarrassed now. 
MR. HOPKINS (cont'd) Look, we've been here for years.  This is a quiet street.  We'd just like to keep it that way. 
Jacob can't take this guy anymore.  He stands up and faces the older man with a scowl. 
JACOB Lighten up, mister. 
JACOB Springwood. 
MARY Springwood?  Where's that? 
JACOB Upstate about a hundred miles. 
DAVID (suspicious) I know this state like the back of my hand.  I've never heard of Springwood. 
There is an uncomfortable pause.  Then Karen suddenly breaks in. 
KAREN Jacob's a little down on his luck.  I told him he could stay here a few days. 
Jacob gives here a surprised look. 
MARY Are your parents in Springwood? 
JACOB My father died before I was born.  My mother, she's dead, too. 
DAVID You have a legal guardian? 
JACOB No. 
DAVID Been in any state or federal program? 
JACOB No. 
KAREN Just for a little while.  So he can get his bearings. 
DAVID Got any ID? 
Jacob reaches for his back pocket - it's empty.  He shakes his head "no". 
MARY (to David) I think we can help him out, honey.  The budget's tight, but we can't turn down someone in need. 
David doesn't acknowledge his wife, he just stares at Jacob sternly.  Karen bites her nails.  Then David sits down and starts to lecture. 
DAVID Okay.  You got three, maybe four days to rest up while we try and find a more permanent arrangement for you.  But his isn't going to be a free ride.  We're part of a community summer work project and eighty percent of the money you make goes to the house.  Everybody works - and that includes you.  Are you on drugs? 
JACOB No. 
DAVID Good.  If I catch anything stronger then an aspirin on you, you're outta here.  No arguments.  You got that straight? 
JACOB Yes, sir. 
DAVID Okay.  Dinner in two hours.  Why don't you go meet the rest of the gang. 
KAREN Thanks, David. 
MARY I'll go fix up the spare bed in Wesley's room. 
David gets up.  He gives Jacob a final once-over. 
DAVID And take a shower, for chrissakes. 
David leaves the room.  Karen gives Jacob a huge grin. 
INT. FOSTER HOME - THE TV ROOM - DAY 
Karen leads Jacob into the room.  There are two teenagers on the couch: WESLEY is a fifteen-year old, curly hair, kind of small.  GINA is also fifteen, brunette hair, seems pretty happy. 
KAREN Hey, guys, I got someone for you to meet. This is Jacob.  Jacob, this is Wesley and Gina. 
JACOB Hi. 
WESLEY Welcome to fun central. 
KAREN He's going to be staying with us for a while. 
GINA Oh yeah?  How'd you get through the blockade? 
Another kid, SCOTT, pops into the room.  He's sixteen, dark hair, with a tough-guy I could give a shit attitude.  He doesn't seem to care about anybody in the room, except for Karen. 
SCOTT Hey, beautiful.  How's it going? 
KAREN Hi, Scott. 
Scott notices Jacob and frowns.  Karen is a little annoyed. 
SCOTT Who's Barney Rubble? 
KAREN This is Jacob Johnson.  He's a new resident.  At least temporarily. 
SCOTT That's because this all rates an eleven on the bullshit meter!  I don't know why we have to listen to this crap.  You're scaring the hell out of Wes here. 
GINA Keep your voice down. 
SCOTT It doesn't matter.  The Ross's sleep like rocks, which is what we all should be doing. 
JACOB I know this sounds crazy, but I swear it's true.  I went to bed one night and woke up in the middle of the road. Freddy Krueger killed my mother, blasted my whole town into his nightmare, and, worst of all, I think he wants to use me to kill more kids and bring more towns into his world. 
KAREN How? 
JACOB I'm not sure.  I think I'm some kind of carrier.  He's somehow inside me and as soon as I fall deep enough into sleep he'll be let loose.  You guys were great to take me in.  I just don't want to thank you by getting you all killed. 
Scott gets up and goes to a desk.  He pulls out a map and shows it to Jacob. 
SCOTT Okay.  Show me Springwood. 
Jacob looks at the map and points. 
SCOTT (cont'd) There's nothing there. 
JACOB That's what I've been trying to tell you. 
SCOTT There's NEVER been a town there. 
JACOB That's how YOU see it.  I was part of the nightmare, so I'm the only one who notices the difference. 
Scott stares at Jacob.  He actually grows sympathetic. 
SCOTT Look, Jacob.  You don't have to convince us that nightmares are real.  Everybody in this room has been through one.  And some of us are still living it.  But the thing is, we know it's just in our heads now.  It can be just as bad as the real thing was, but it's still only a memory. It can't hurt us physically, unless we do the hurting ourselves. 
GINA And we don't want to see you get hurt. 
WESLEY We know it gets crazy.  And we'll help out the best we can. 
SCOTT But this is just too hard to believe. 
Jacob plops down on the couch, defeated.  He hangs his head while the kids start to get up.  Wesley gives him a pat on the back as he, Scott, and Gina leave.  But Karen is still here. 
She sits next to a window with a faraway look in her eyes. Jacob looks up at her. 
JACOB You don't believe me, either, do you? 
KAREN I don't know. 
JACOB Why are you still here? 
KAREN I'm not sure.  I guess, I guess I see a lot of me in you. 
JACOB Feels good to see someone more fucked up than yourself, huh? 
Karen smiles and sits down next to him. 
KAREN Yeah.  That must be it. 
JACOB But you haven't told me why you're here at this place. 
KAREN I can't talk about it right now.  Maybe later.  Do you want me to stay with you? 
JACOB Yeah, that'd be great.  Don't let me sleep, okay? 
KAREN I'll do my best. 
She reaches for the remote control and flicks on the TV, moving a little closer to Jacob when she sits back into the couch.  The two of them watch the screen with glassy eyes. 
KAREN (cont'd) Thank God for cable TV. 
JACOB Yeah.  Thank God. 
They continue to watch in silence as Karen takes hold of Jacob's hand. 
INT. FOSTER HOME - THE TV ROOM - MORNING 
We are ON KAREN as she sleeps curled up on the couch.  Jacob is in the background putting on his shoes.  He has a brown paper bag with him. 
Jacob gets up, grabs his bag, and steps over to Karen.  He gently pulls a lock of hair away from her face.  Then he heads for the front door. 
EXT. FOSTER HOME - FRONT PORCH - DAY 
Jacob walks out the door and closes it behind him.  He crosses to the porch steps and stops.  He has to hold onto a porch column just to keep standing. 
Karen appears behind him.  Jacob jumps a bit. 
We're directly across the street from the Foster Home as Jacob's cries echo through the neighborhood.  Mr. Hopkins opens the front door.  He sees what's going on, scowls, and yells into his house. 
MR. HOPKINS I told you!  It's an overdose!  Jesus Christ, I saw this coming.  Call 9-1-1! 
He watches the commotion growing across the street, and never once moves to help. 
EXT. FOSTER HOME - MOMENTS LATER 
Jacob is being strapped into a stretcher, babbling incoherently.  The residents of the Foster Home stand off to the side while neighbors gawk from the street.  Karen is next to the AMBULANCE GUYS looking frantic. 
JACOB No!  Don't let them take me! 
KAREN Jacob, it'll be alright. 
AMBULANCE GUY #1 Calm down, kid.  We'll take care of you. 
Jacob grabs the Ambulance Guy. 
JACOB You don't understand!  Let me go! 
The ambulance guy straps Jacob's arm down.  Mr. Ross grabs Karen and pulls her away as they start loading the crazed teenager into the ambulance.  Scott shakes his head.  Wesley looks terrified.  Gina keeps her distance from any human. Karen can't take it and runs into the house.  Mr. Ross frowns. 
DAVID This is just what we need. 
The ambulance drives away as the gathered crowd stares at the kids angrily. 
INT. AMBULANCE - DAY 
Jacob yells and struggles as an Ambulance Guy prepares a syringe for injection. 
JACOB Don't fucking put me under!  You'll set him free! 
The ambulance guy holds Jacob down and slams the needle home. Jacob screams and his eyes start to glass over. 
JACOB (cont'd) He'll kill them all... 
Jacob's head starts to go limp.  A VOICE rings out in the van, a voice only Jacob hears: 
FREDDY (O.S.) Every town as an Elm Street! 
LAUGHTER echoes as Jacob turns his head towards a window. 
EXT. A STREET CORNER - DAY 
The ambulance zooms by.  All is quiet for a second until CRASH! A twisted rusty sign post erupts out of the sidewalk and settles at an ugly angle. 
It's an ELM ST. sign. 
INT. AMBULANCE - DAY 
We PULL BACK from a wide awake Jacob, who is now suddenly alone in the van.  Outside the window there is only darkness. Jacob twists and struggles on the stretcher as 
CLANG! the ambulance doors crash open revealing BLACKNESS and KA-BOOM!  the stretcher is shot out of the van like a cannonball. 
INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY 
The stretcher with Jacob BLASTS through a wall and starts to race across the floor of the building that Jacob had been sweeping up the day before. 
It careens along, actually taking a few turns, like it has a mind of its own, heading for a shallow pit in the middle of the warehouse. 
The stretcher hits the pit, drops a bit, swings up violently, and stops in a vertical position like a rake that has been stepped on AND A BLACK HUMAN SHAPE shoots out of Jacob's body from intertial force, staying upright as it slides across the floor, spins, stops, then changes into: 
FREDDY KRUEGER 
Freddy has his hands on his hips and a grin on his face. 
FREDDY Thanks for the lift, kid! 
He saunters up to Jacob who is still strapped to the vertical stretcher.  Krueger waves his knives and wiggles his tongue. 
JACOB What do you want from me? 
FREDDY I already got it!  The rest I'm going to get from your new little friends. 
JACOB Leave them alone! 
FREDDY It's my duty to clean up the neighborhood! 
JACOB What have you done with my town? 
FREDDY Aw, poor baby's homesick, isn't he? Don't worry.  We'll all be one happy family soon.  Wanna be the first recruit? 
SOUND COP I think you're the wrong guy to talk about attitudes. 
BLADE COP Guys, guys.  This is getting us nowhere. 
She takes her helmet completely off, long dark hair tumbling over her shoulders.  It's TARYN, the ex-junkie.  These three, they're the Dream Warriors.  Or at least they used to be. 
JACOB Hello?  May I butt in here and ask some more stupid questions? 
The three of them stop bickering and turn to Jacob.  Blade walks up to Jacob.  Her two partners assume position behind her. 
BLADE COP We don't know much more than you do. What we do know is that we've been recruited... 
JACOB By who? 
SOUND COP We don't know. 
JACOB Why? 
BLADE COP I think that's obvious. 
POWER COP The shit's about to hit the fan. 
SOUND COP Krueger's discovered new powers. 
BLADE COP He's ripped a hole between dreams and reality. 
POWER COP Our own powers have been amplified. 
SOUND COP We only hope it will be enough. 
BLADE COP But we're going to need your help. 
JACOB Me?  What can I do?  Just who are you guys...really? 
Blade puts her helmet back on.  Her face turns grim. 
BLADE COP We were like you.  We fought Freddy Krueger many years ago.  Our souls were released from his grip.  No we're back to try again. 
All three of them drop their visors down at the same time. 
JACOB I still don't understand what... 
Jacob's voice starts to GARBLE. He keeps trying to talk but the words come out twisted and clipped.  He raises a hand to his throat.  The hand is transparent.  Jacob looks at his body as it slowly starts to disappear and now he's completely mute. 
SOUND COP Freddy Krueger can't hurt us anymore. 
POWER COP Because we're already dead. 
Jacob vanishes completely. 
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT 
Jacob opens his eyes.  He's in bed, dressed in a white smock. A DOCTOR stands next to him with a clipboard in hand. 
JACOB What's going on? 
DOCTOR Just relax, everything's fine. 
JACOB That's what you say... 
DOCTOR You're lucky you're here instead of juvenile hall.  You put up quite a fight. But you're clean.  No traces of drugs or alcohol in your blood. 
JACOB I could've told you that. 
Jacob starts getting out of bed. 
DOCTOR Hold on there. 
JACOB You said I was fine.  I have to get back. My friends are in trouble. 
DOCTOR I said you weren't on drugs, but I never said you were fine.  You're suffering from extreme fatigue and stress that manifested itself into one hell of an anxiety attack.  At least that's what we hope it is.  You had a major seizure, Jacob. 
JACOB You don't understand.  This whole town is in danger. 
DOCTOR We're keeping you here for observation. You're not going anywhere tonight. 
JACOB You can't do that.  You don't have the right! 
DOCTOR Yes we do.  Your temporary guardian, Mr. Ross, signed all the papers.  If you're okay in the morning we might let you go home.  Until then, you're bed bound. 
JACOB But... 
WESLEY (cont'd) Hey. 
He struggles harder now, but to no avail.  He's wrapped tight, like a cigarette. 
ON THE TV the two orderlies torment the straight-jacketed lunatic, poking his face with their lit cigarettes.  As the lunatic SCREAMS, the screams become magnified, again becoming that loud, deafening ROAR we heard before.  Wesley squirms in his blanket/ straight-jacket, he jerks his head around, SEEING with each of the man's SCREAMS, the walls of the room SHUDDER INWARD and 
Wesley's EYES WIDEN with horror as he realizes not only is he TRAPPED like a sardine in his stark white blanket, but the walls of the room are starting to CLOSE IN on him.  He SPINS back to the TV set, where: 
The first orderly is now looking AT US.  Wesley REACTS as he notices something familiar about the man's face. 
FIRST ORDERLY Relax, Wesley. 
WESLEY Dad? 
The second orderly BOLTS into view.  He has become Freddy Krueger. 
FREDDY Yeah, Wesley.  Everything's gonna be great!  Just have a smoke on us! 
As they hold their smokes out TOWARD US, their arms PROTRUDE FROM THE TV SET with their lit cigarettes. 
Wesley SCREAMS and jerks his head away from TV and he HITS the floor with an ugly THUMP.  The wind knocked out of him. He rolls.  The couch is GONE. 
As he squirms and struggles to escape his white cocoon, the frightened boy looks around and sees that everything in the room - furniture, carpet, TV, even the door - are all gone, leaving just the white walls SLOWLY CLOSING IN ON HIM. 
Then we see that on the floor all around Wesley are long, cylindrical white objects.  Clearly, they resemble GIANT CIGARETTES, and Wesley - wrapped neck-to-toe in his white blanket cocoon - looks just like one of them. 
He continues to squirm and SCREAM as the walls CLOSE IN from all sides -- closer -- CLOSER -- pushing the long white things toward him, around him, bunching them together until they are in a tight cluster, as the room CRUNCHES IN TIGHTLY, blocking whatever light source there is, until all Wesley can do is SCREAM one last time, and 
The screen goes BLACK. 
After a few beats, we hear a huge, deafening RIPPING SOUND, and a new LIGHT SOURCE appears as  Wesley looks up, eyes wide with unspeakable horror as the giant, scarred face of FREDDY looms over him, grinning, and we: 
INT. FOSTER HOME - TV ROOM 
The room is back to normal, but not the occupant.  Freddy Krueger now stands here alone.  He has just peeled the wrapper off a pack of cigarettes of which Wesley has become one. 
FREDDY Didn't Daddy ever tell you what the Surgeon General says...? 
Krueger reaches in and pulls the tiny Wesley out of the pack. As before, Wesley is immobile, helpless.  Freddy holds him between two fingers. 
FREDDY (cont'd) Smoking's bad for your health! 
Freddy looks around, as if searching for something, then beams as he reaches into the air and... 
FREDDY (cont'd) Ah!  A match made in heaven! 
He produces a puny version of WESLEY'S FATHER In one hand. His body is straight and rigid, like a match stick. 
Freddy places his thumb on the stiff man's head, and flicks his thumbnail, causing the man's skull to BURST INTO FLAME, an evil grin spanning Wesley's Father's face. 
He brings the Father-Match to what would be Wesley's tiny feet, and lights the end. 
VERY CLOSE ON FREDDY'S HAND 
Wesley SCREAMS as Freddy tosses the FATHER-MATCH and brings the teenager's little head up to his fire-scarred lips. 
The boy is enveloped by the massive cracked opening as Freddy takes a huge drag off of Wesley's head. Where his feet should be, the tip of the Wesley-Cig GLOWS RED, causing Wesley to SCREAM with supernatural pain.  Smoke billows from Freddy's nose and mouth.  He savors it. 
FREDDY (cont'd) Ahhhh!  Now we're smokin'! 
He CACKLES horribly as he continues to suck on the Wesley- Cig.  With each puff, Wesley's white-wrapped body becomes slat-black ash. 
FREDDY (cont'd) What's your sign, Wesley?  It wouldn't be Cancer, would it? 
In between his demonic CACKLES, Freddy DRAGS on the Wesley- Cig, each puff turning more of Wesley into ash until all but his head is black and charred.  Freddy holds the Wesley-Cig out, poised to tap the ashes loose. 
FREDDY (cont'd) Now say the secret word and you know what you'll win... 
WESLEY Go to hell! 
Freddy grins. 
FREDDY Right... 
And he taps the Wesley-cig with his finger.  The ashes immediately fall, sifting in the air as Wesley's head - charred and black at the neck where it's been separated - falls loose.  Wesley SCREAMS. 
WESLEY Noooooooo! 
and his severed head falls and falls and falls. 
INT. FOSTER HOME - TV ROOM - THE NEXT DAY 
INT. WESLEY & JACOB'S BEDROOM - DAY 
Jacob closes the door.  All the kids are here.  Gina absentmindedly plays with some of Wesley's things. 
JACOB When I was put under, Freddy was released.  I know this because I dreamed it. 
SCOTT And that dream was real? 
JACOB Yes.  Wesley was his first victim. 
SCOTT Aw, man... 
JACOB You said it yourself.  How could it have been a cigarette? 
KAREN And how could he...dire that way and not wake up? 
GINA (mockingly) Maybe the "authorities" will figure it out. 
SCOTT I'm sorry.  I just can't buy into this. 
JACOB Call me crazy...but I think he's after Rosedale.  The whole place.  In my dream he said something about needing a few souls to get the job done. I think he has to kill in order to get the power to suck in a new town. 
SCOTT You are crazy. 
JACOB Thank you.  There's more.  There are... other people in there.  In the nightmares. 
KAREN Like him? 
JACOB No. Different.  There are three of them. They're dressed in black. They have powers like Freddy, but they seem to be on our side. 
KAREN Who are they? 
JACOB Well, you gotta hang in there with me on this one.  They call themselves... the Dream Police. 
Scott actually laughs. 
SCOTT This is too much. 
GINA You mean...like cops? 
JACOB I guess. 
KAREN Where are they from? 
JACOB They're kids that Freddy killed years ago.  THEY don't even know how they got there.  But they're somehow patrolling dreamworld to put a stop to Krueger. 
SCOTT Then why haven't these guys done the job already? 
JACOB They say they need help.  I don't know what or why...yet. 
SCOTT I can tell you who needs help. 
JACOB Hey, I'm trying to save all of us. 
SCOTT I won't believe it until I see it. 
Jacob is crushed that he's not getting through to them. 
JACOB By then it'll be too late.  It was too late for Wesley. 
The kids stare emptily at Wesley's earthly possessions. 
EXT. FOSTER HOME - FRONT PORCH - NIGHT 
Jacob and Karen sit on the steps.  Across the street we can see window curtains part as Mr. Hopkins sneaks a wary peek. 
KAREN They're going to use all this to shut us down. 
JACOB I know.  It's my fault. 
KAREN You going to try to run away again? 
JACOB It's too late for that. I have to stay and try and put a stop to it. 
KAREN I'm sorry.  It's all so hard to accept. 
JACOB I wish I could convince you of the danger you and the others are in. 
KAREN I've been in danger before. THAT I can handle. 
JACOB This is worse than anything you can imagine. 
She ducks behind a tree.  And comes out suddenly dressed as a sharp BUSINESSWOMAN.  Jacob is slightly taken aback. 
KAREN (cont'd) I like to be other people! 
Jacob grins as she steps behind another tree - and a FIREMAN walks out in her place.  Jacob is really taken aback this time. 
KAREN (cont'd) (as fireman) I can be anybody I want. 
JACOB Show off. 
Karen slips past another trunk and comes out as a tall VOLUPTUOUS REDHEAD. 
KAREN (AS REDHEAD) When things get bad it helps to be someone else.  I use it to protect myself. 
The redhead walks seductively towards Jacob.  He raises his eyebrows as she slinks right up next to him - her ample cleavage inches away from his nose. 
KAREN (cont'd) (as redhead) What do you think? 
JACOB I think I like you the way you always are. 
He smiles. 
DIFFERENT ANGLE 
And now Karen is herself again.  They're still very close. 
JACOB (cont'd) Much better. 
They look like they're about to kiss... but Karen suddenly sees something that grabs her attention. 
KAREN Look! 
Jacob turns as Karen runs over to ANOTHER DOOR.  It's not the one to the bedroom.  It just hangs there in space between two trees. 
KAREN (cont'd) I wonder where it goes? 
She reaches for the knob and opens it. 
JACOB Karen, no! 
But she's already stepped through.  Jacob runs up to the doorway and it SLAMS in his face.  Jacob tries to open the door.  It doesn't budge.  He keeps twisting the knob to no effect. 
JACOB (cont'd) Karen! 
Jacob starts to pound on the door as we: 
CUT TO: 
INT. KAREN'S HOME - KITCHEN 
Sixties style decore, appliances that look about twenty-five years old -- not the Foster Home kitchen at all.  Karen is standing in the middle of the room, completely disoriented. She walks across to a counter top where she finds a framed picture. 
It's a picture of HER, Karen, age thirteen.  Karen sets the picture down and quickly walks back to the door she came in. 
INT. KAREN'S HOME - LOWER HALLWAY 
Karen steps out of her old kitchen expecting, hoping to be back in the forest again.  Nope.  She blinks.  Then she starts to walk down the corridor. 
More pictures on the wall this time.  One of a WOMAN and another of a MAN (Karen's MOM and DAD). 
Karen's sure of it now.  She's home.  The center of her worst nightmares.  She creeps along to the main stairs.  And that's when the NOISES begin.  A thumping from upstairs.  A CRASH, like something hit the floor above.  More thumping, repeatedly and then human MOANING, the sound of pain. 
Somebody is getting beaten. 
KAREN Oh no... 
Something is twisting deep inside the girl.  Her face goes shallow as she slowly shuffles around to the foot of the stairs...and starts to climb them. 
ON THE STAIRS 
Karen goes up, step by painful step, as the sounds of the BEATING increase in their intensity.  Every hit seems to touch Karen as she flinches.  She's afraid to go on - but can't seem to stop. 
INT. KAREN'S HOME - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY 
Karen slowly heads for a door at the end, nervously reaches out for the knob. 
INT. KAREN'S PARENT'S BEDROOM 
Karen opens the door.  What she thought she was going to see was bad enough - but this is worse: 
Freddy Krueger is in the middle of the room.  In front of him is a giant human-sized version of an inflatable punching doll, the kind little kids hit that keep bouncing back.  But the doll doesn't have the image of a clown on it. 
Karen is confused.  She doesn't know what to make of all this.  She looks at a clock.  It's late. 
KAREN You better get back to your room.  We don't want anybody to get the wrong idea. 
JACOB (smirks) Or the right one? 
Karen finally relaxes.  She smiles and playfully pushes him. 
KAREN Get out of here. 
Jacob reaches under a pillow and pulls something out.  It's the framed photo of Karen, age thirteen - from her dream.  He hands it to her and she looks at it in astonishment. 
JACOB That's something else my mom taught me. 
He gets up and goes to the door, turning back to her. 
JACOB (cont'd) Don't sleep. 
KAREN No.  Not tonight. 
She holds the picture tightly- staring at it with those faraway eyes. 
INT. FOSTER HOME - UPPER HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Scott comes out of the bathroom in his night clothes, the toilet flushing in the B.G.  He goes into his room, but stops at the doorway when he hears Karen's door open. 
Scott ducks behind his door as he watches Jacob leave Karen's room and head for his own.  Scott frowns.  His is not pleased. 
INT. FOSTER HOME - DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY 
David Ross is sifting through some mail when a heated conversation in the kitchen catches his interest.  He stops to listen. 
IN THE KITCHEN 
Karen is finally convinced, Jacob and Scott are looking like they're ready to punch each other, and Gina looks scared. 
KAREN I'm telling you, this Freddy guy is for real. 
SCOTT And I'm telling you a dream is a dream. 
KAREN Jacob was in there with me. 
SCOTT And where else was he with you last night? 
JACOB What the hell is that supposed to mean? 
KAREN I have the picture in my room if you want to see it.  He brought it out from the nightmare. 
SCOTT Or from your hope chest.  I bet your bed isn't the only thing he's been into. 
KAREN That picture was destroyed years ago. 
JACOB You better watch your mouth, pal. 
SCOTT I'm the last person you want to start fucking with. 
JACOB Go ahead and be a tough guy, Scott. Krueger will cut you to pieces before you can even flex a muscle. 
GINA Will you two stop it!  You're scaring the shit out of me. 
KAREN You should be scared. 
Mr. Ross enters the room, none too pleased. 
DAVID Alright.  What's going on here? 
SCOTT Join the fun.  Jacob and Karen were just telling us about their new excuse to sleep together. 
JACOB Nothing happened between us last night. 
SCOTT You mean in plain old reality, right? 
DAVID Okay, everybody.  Out.  Jacob and I are going to have a little talk.  Now. 
Scott, Gina and Karen grudgingly leave the room.  David turns to Jacob. 
DAVID (cont'd) Your days are numbered here, buster. 
JACOB I'm sorry, but... 
DAVID Hey, I don't know what kind of shit you're shoveling to these kids, but it's going to stop.  My Good Samaritan instincts have their limits.  We've had enough tragedy around this place.  We don't need you making things worse with fantasies. 
KAREN What do you mean, nothing? 
JACOB It's over.  We're finished.  He's won. 
Jacob walks on ahead of them.  Karen is flabbergasted.  She stops and just stands there with Scott.  The two of them watching Jacob walk away. 
SCOTT Looks like your hero just gave up. 
And Karen still can't believe it. 
EXT. JUVENILE HALL COURTYARD - DUSK 
Jacob is sitting on a bench looking like a beaten man and hating himself for it. 
Karen and Scott step out of a door.  They watch him for a few seconds.  Then Karen walks towards Jacob.  Scott stays behind and lights up a cigarette. 
KAREN How can you do this? 
JACOB Do what?  I'm not doing anything. 
KAREN Exactly.  After all we've been through you just throw in the towel.  Why? 
JACOB Because we're fucked.  The last thing the Dream Police told me was that they needed all our help.  Together.  Even if we weren't about to be split up there aren't enough of us left to make a difference. 
KAREN How do you know that? 
JACOB I don't.  But, it's all just too much. I've tried so hard and nothing's worked. I'm spent.  I'm wasted.  I'm...I'm so tired. 
Jacob puts his face in his hands. 
JACOB (cont'd) I've had enough. 
KAREN So you're just going to give up?  I'll bet that's something your mother never taught you. 
That hit home.  Jacob uncovers his face.  His ID bracelet dangles from his wrist.  He looks at the bracelet.  ALICE glints in the setting sunlight.  He remembers.  Jacob looks up at Karen. 
KAREN (cont'd) We still have one night together. 
JACOB And we're not going to waste it. 
Jacob stands up. 
INT. JUVENILE HALL LOUNGE - NIGHT 
Jacob paces back and forth in front of Scott and Karen. 
KAREN Scott, we need you. 
SCOTT Look, I don't know what's going on anymore.  Two of my friends die and now you tell me I have to drop into dreamland with you guys to do battle with the dude that did it. 
JACOB We'll have help. 
SCOTT Ah, yes.  I almost forgot.  The Sleepy Squad.  Alright.  I'll make you a deal. I told you I wouldn't believe this stuff unless I saw it.  If I understand this correctly, all I have to do is fall asleep and you just whisk me into the action. 
JACOB Right. 
SCOTT Okay.  If that happens, if both of you show up in my dream, I'll help you out. If nothing happens, then I'll get a good night's sleep and laugh at you in the morning. 
JACOB Fine.  You got a deal.  And you won't be disappointed. 
KAREN I'm going to be sleeping in the girl's dorm.  Will you be able to bring me in? 
JACOB I hope so.  Then I got to make sure we all end up in Springwood. 
SCOTT The old stomping ground? 
JACOB Yeah.  Only right now it's not a very pretty place. 
KAREN What do we do when we get there? 
JACOB Play it by ear.  And try and stay alive. 
A SOCIAL WORKER sticks his head into the lounge. 
SOCIAL WORKER Half hour til lights out, everyone. 
The kids get up and start for the door. 
JACOB Off we go. 
SCOTT Into the wild black yonder. 
She stumbles quickly down the street.  We catch fleeting glimpses of other horrors, twisted shapes, bent shadows. 
Karen rounds a corner, and SCREAMS when she bumps into someone.  It's Scott, out of breath from his own sprinting. 
KAREN Scott!  You're here. 
SCOTT Yeah.  Fun town.  Talk to any of the neighbors, yet? They're a swell bunch of folks. 
KAREN Uh-huh.  Real friendly, too. 
SCOTT So this is a dream? 
KAREN And I'm in it with you.  Convinced? 
SCOTT Maybe I'm just dreaming bout being here with you.  Wouldn't be the first time. 
KAREN Nope.  I tired that one already.  Doesn't work.  Come on, we have to find Jacob. 
Scott nods and they take off down the street.  A cat with three tails slithers by. 
EXT. NIGHTMARE SPRINGWOOD - MAIN STREET - NIGHT 
Jacob is standing motionless in the middle of the road.  He stares down into the darkness, a wooden expression on his face. 
Karen and Scott are running up behind him. 
KAREN Jacob!  Thank God! 
SCOTT So this is the place, huh? 
Jacob's eyes are steady.  He hasn't yet acknowledged the other's presence.  He eyes are fixed on the gloominess in front of him.  A look of vengeance beginning to grow as our SHOT MOVES IN on him. 
JACOB I'm home. 
Karen and Scott are next to him now.  They stand silently with Jacob for a few seconds.  Then: 
KAREN What now? 
JACOB Scott, are you with us? 
SCOTT A deal's a deal. 
JACOB Then we wait. 
And not for long.  FLASH!  In three bursts the Dream Police appear directly across from the teenagers.  Scott and Karen jump back.  Jacob hold his ground. 
SCOTT Whoa! 
The threesomes stand face-to-face in two parallel rows. 
SCOTT (cont'd) Nice outfits. 
POWER COP Is this all? 
JACOB All that's left. 
SOUND COP It'll have to do. 
SCOTT We can always come back later.  Like when it's daytime. 
POWER COP It's always night here. 
JACOB What's the plan? 
BLADE COP We need you to draw him out. 
SCOTT Terrific.  We're supposed to be bait. 
SOUND COP Essentially. 
JACOB Then let's do it. 
KABOOOOOOOOM!  A huge BRICK WALL, ten feet high and spreading out across the street and through the houses, BLASTS up from the asphalt.  Right between the Police and the kids. 
ON THE DREAM POLICE SIDE 
The three cops crouch into battle positions. 
ON THE TEENAGER'S SIDE 
The three of them have hardly any time to react before three perfectly round HOLES open up underneath each of them. 
SCOTT Um, a beer, I guess. 
The bartender fills a twisted glass with a sickly brown liquid.  Chunks of matter float amongst the foam.  Scott takes the drink warily and looks up at the businessman next to him.  The mutant smiles at him. 
BARTENDER Go on.  Puts hair on your back. 
SCOTT And that's all? 
The bartender returns.  Holds one of those half pineapple type drinks in his hand, except this one has the back end of a wriggling lizard sticking out of mucousy fluid under a tiny umbrella.  He gives it to Scott. 
SCOTT (cont'd) That's okay, this'll be plenty. 
BARTENDER No charge.  Compliments of the man at the end of the bar. 
The bartender walks away and Scott cranes his head to look down the bar. 
SCOTT'S POV 
The crowd blocks his view, but we can see a gloved hand with four blades strapped to it tapping nonchalantly on the surface of the wood. 
BACK TO SCOTT 
He picks up his drinks, holding the moving one at arm's length, and heads down the bar. 
AT THE END OF THE BAR 
sits Freddy Krueger.  He sips coolly on some hideous concoction as Scott sits down in the chair next to him and lights a cigarette, trying to look equally cool. 
FREDDY Welcome to my favorite haunt. 
SCOTT So you're the man. 
FREDDY At your service. 
SCOTT What's on your mind? 
FREDDY A deal. 
SCOTT A deal's what got me into this. 
FREDDY Bring Jacob to me. 
Scott, valiantly holding on to his nerve, raises an eyebrow. 
SCOTT What's in it for me? 
FREDDY Power.  You don't need to hang out with those losers. You're a take-charge kind of guy, Scott.  Like when you took charge of your father. 
Suddenly Freddy is spinning a gun on the bar with his free hand.  Scott grimaces. 
SCOTT Leave my father out of this. 
FREDDY I'll make you mayor of Rosedale. 
SCOTT After you make it look like this? 
FREDDY You can have Karen. 
That was Freddy's trump card.  It really hits a nerve in Scott.  Karen's everything he's ever wanted. 
SCOTT Alive? 
FREDDY Any way you want her. 
SCOTT (after a beat) Okay. 
FREDDY Shake? 
Krueger holds out his knives.  Scott shakes his head. 
SCOTT No thanks.  I trust you. 
Freddy laughs. 
INT. NIGHTMARE JOHNSON HOME - ALICE'S BEDROOM 
Jacob opens the door into darkness. 
JACOB Mother? 
He turns on the light and a RED HAZE blankets the room. Jacob looks up.  The dish-like ceiling lamp is filled with blood. 
CRUNCH!  Power Cop puts a stop to the bouncer with a vicious elbow in the chest.  All this gave Freddy a few seconds to grab a chair and crack it ineffectually over the Cop's head. The pummeling begins again. 
THWACK THWACK THWACK!  Power Cop is punching Freddy towards the door. 
EXT. SPRINGWOOD TAVERN 
Like in an old wester, Krueger flies out of the double doors and somersaults onto the pavement.  Sound Cop is a few yards away knelt down next to Scott's dead body.  He looks up as Freddy sneers. 
FREDDY No more playing around. 
Freddy raises his left fist and it begins to EXPAND.  It grows like an inflated beach ball, except it doesn't look soft at all.  Freddy slides up to the side of the entrance, and raises his giant hammer hand.  Power Cop steps through, looking for blood.  Sound Cop tries to warn him. 
SOUND COP Kincaid! 
Too late.  BAM!  Freddy's fist slams down on Power Cop's head.  He's actually shoved down into the ground a full two feet - trapped at the legs. 
BAM!  Freddy hits him again.  Power Cop is down to his thighs and he can't get out. 
A RUMBLING is heard.  Freddy turns to see Sound Cop starting to open his mouth.  Krueger instantly reaches down and grabs a brick from the rubble and THROWS it at Sound Cop. 
FREDDY Put a lid on it! 
THUNK!  The brick lands squarely in Sound Cop's mouth, stretching it painfully and blocking it completely.  Sound Cop reels from the impact.  Tries to pull out the firmly wedged plug. 
Freddy turns back to Power Cop, BAM!  Hits him down to his hips.  The giant fist swings, BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM! like hammering a nail until Power Cop DISAPPEARS into the ground. 
Freddy's hand deflates to regular size as he turns to the struggling Sound Cop. 
Sound Cop's head is EXPANDING.  Pressure seems to be building up, something's gonna blow.  Freddy picks up a boulder from the street rubble.  He catapults it with both hands at Sound Cop.  The boulder hits Sound Cop's head and takes it CLEAN OFF. 
Sound Cop's decapitated skull tumbles away with the brick still stuck, as a blast of air shoots up from the stump of his neck with a SCREECH. 
Sound Cop's body stumbles for a few seconds, then falls over limply. 
Freddy LAUGHS and laughs and laughs... KACHUNK! until a KNIFE embeds itself in his back.  Krueger spins around. 
CHUNK CHUNK CHUNK!  Three more knives slam into his body as he staggers back in surprise.  Blade Cop stands twenty feet away reaching into thin air and whipping out knife after knife, flinging them at Freddy.  They sail like flying bullets. 
CHUNK CHUNK CHUNK!  Krueger falls back from the sheer force of the onslaught, at least a dozen blades sticking out of his body. 
Blade stops. She stands there for a beat, waiting to see what Freddy will do next. 
Krueger sways, looking like an inhuman pincushion.  Then he grins.  His body steadies, and he suddenly poses like a body builder and flexes every muscle. 
POP POP POP!  The daggers shoot out of his torso and limbs, CLATTERING to the ground. 
The girl in black steps back and raises her arms.  SHINK SHINK!  Two-foot-long sabers jut out from her forearms. They're not held by her, they're a PART of her, exiting from the tops of her wrists under her clenched fists.  She crosses the blades in front of her. 
FREDDY (cont'd) (smiling) Ah... a girl after my own heart. 
KACHINK! Freddy shoots out his finger knives and they EXTEND to double their normal size.  He raises them and takes on a fencing stance. 
FREDDY (cont'd) En guard, bitch 
SWOOP/CLANG!  A swordfight ensues.  Freddy swinging his four long knives.  Blade slashing her rapier-arms.  They lunge, they parry, they leap, they duck. 
CLANG!  They connect.  SCREEEEE.  Metal scrapes metal.  It's a bastardized version of an Errol Flynn movie and Blade Cop and Freddy are equally matched.  Blade moves to get the upper hand. 
CLINK CLINK!  Blades shoot out of the girl's ELBOWS.  Now when she takes a swing with her fists, another sword is right behind it on the follow-through. 
Freddy gets caught off-guard.  Gets slashed twice in the shoulder and twirls away.  Then starts to move FASTER. 
Blade counters with an equally increased intensity.  Freddy ducks, SWOOPS out twice quickly.  A fold of black cloth drops down on Blade's stomach, revealing naked skin and a little blood.  They pause for a second. 
FREDDY (cont'd) Touche. 
And Blade becomes AIRBORNE putting a Samurai to shame, twirling her legs up and out as a blade juts momentarily from her RIGHT HEEL, chopping off Freddy's left hand. 
Krueger stumbles back in astonishment as green goo spurts out of the stump. 
Astonishment turns to rage as the two converge again, swinging away at an incredible rate.  An impossible rate. 
JACOB rounds the corner.  He stumbles into the action just as the battling pair are becoming an obscure swirling GLINTING MASS.  Pieces of them start to drop away. 
Blade's foot hits the ground.  Freddy's arm plops away.  A broken sword hits the asphalt under the spinning cloud, then one of Blade's arms. 
CLOSE ON JACOB 
as he watches, his eyes dart to try to follow the action that's moving too fast for him to see. 
Then there's silence. 
Karen frowns.  She turns back to the house, a determined expression on her face. 
KAREN No more... 
She KICKS the gate open and walks up to the house. 
INT. ELM STREET HOUSE 
We've been here before, haven't we?  But for Karen it's the first visit as she opens the front door and walks in.  She takes in the twisted skeleton of a home for a few seconds and then begins to SEARCH it. 
INT. ELM STREET HOUSE - LIVING ROOM 
Karen races through, pulling open desk drawers, rifling through shelves, flipping through books.  She doesn't know what she's looking for, but she knows she hasn't found it yet. 
INT. ELM STREET HOUSE - KITCHEN 
The intensity of Karen's quest increases as she yanks open cabinets and tosses plates to the floor.  Still nothing. 
INT. ELM STREET HOUSE - STAIRS 
Karen runs up them, a girl with a mission. 
INT. ELM STREET HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM 
Karen flings the door open.  Nothing but a bed and a set of drawers.  No hint as to the occupant's lives.  She doesn't bother ransacking this one and goes on to: 
INT. ELM STREET HOUSE - FREDDY'S BEDROOM 
Jackpot.  Karen stares through the open door at a child's room, a very twisted child's room.  She slowly walks in. 
A bed, a desk, a dresser.  There's a Jack-in-a-box with its head torn off.  A disemboweled Teddy Bear.  White puffy guts hanging out of it.  A clown doll with its face caved in.  A hanging mobile made of strange bent shapes. 
And a pile of more-than-dirty clothes. 
Karen goes over to the pile and picks through it with her toe.  A small pair of pants, about the right size for an eight-year-old.  A black pair of shoes.  And a little sweater, a RED AND GREEN STRIPED sweater. 
Karen goes over to the desk.  There is stack of drawings on it - a child's drawings.  On one of them it looks like someone was practicing writing their name.  FREDDY UNNERWOOD, FREDDY UNDERWUD, FREDDY UNDERWOOD over and over again.  Until the final attempt has the last name angrily crossed out, replaced underneath by a hastily scrawled KRUEGER!!! 
Another piece of paper: a set of human stick figures.  A small one is labeled FREDDY.  The large one is labeled DADDY. The Daddy figure is depicted HITTING the Freddy figure. 
There are more drawings, all of them violent, the large figure beating away at the small one. 
Suddenly a CREAKING.  Karen jumps.  Hides behind a bookshelf. She's nervously trying to figure out what to do when a framed picture catches her attention on the shelf.  It's a picture of a tall, dark man and a little boy.  Karen reaches out to grab the picture, but accidentally knocks over a glass mug with a CRASH. 
FOOTSTEPS can now be heard tromping up the stairs. 
Someone's coming and Karen's on the edge of panic.  She looks around and finds an old baseball bat.  She grabs it and runs to the side of the doorway as the FOOTSTEPS approach down the hallway.  Karen raises the bat. 
And Jacob appears.  Karen pulls back with the bat as Jacob jumps away from her. 
KAREN Jacob!  You scared the shit out of me! 
JACOB The feeling is mutual. 
KAREN Where are the Dream Police? 
JACOB I told them to look for you.  What are you doing here?  Don't you know what this place is? 
KAREN I do now.  Look what I found. 
She starts to drag him over to the desk of drawings. 
JACOB You've got to get out of here. 
KAREN Wait.  You have to see this. 
JACOB You don't understand.  The Police can't kill Freddy.  They literally chopped each other to pieces and he's still alive! Now I'm supposed to figure out how to get rid of him. 
KAREN But I think I found the answer.  Shut up for a second and look at these. 
She starts showing him the scrawlings. 
JACOB Okay, so he's a bad artist. 
KAREN No!  You told me Krueger's mother committed suicide and no one knows who his father was, right? 
JACOB Yeah... 
KAREN Freddy's been pushing all our buttons with our pasts.  These are HIS past. Don't you get it? HE was a foster child, too! 
She walks over to the bookshelf and grabs the picture of LITTLE FREDDY and FREDDY'S FOSTER FATHER. 
KAREN You're NOT my father. 
KAREN'S FATHER But we're going to have the same fun! 
Karen stares at him defiantly.  And a HAND grabs Karen's Father, and yanks him away.  We PULL BACK. 
KAREN'S MOTHER is next to the bed.  Furious. 
KAREN'S MOTHER That's enough! 
And she SLAPS Karen's Father.  He stands up, SLUGS her across the jaw.  She tumbles back.  Karen sits up. 
KAREN Mommy, no! 
Karen's Mother gets up, a defiant look just like Karen's on her face. 
KAREN'S MOTHER You're never going to touch her again! 
KAREN'S FATHER I'll touch what I want! 
BAP!  He strikes her again, sending her right out the door. He follows her. Karen stands up and runs after them. 
IN THE HALLWAY 
CRACK!  The man hits the woman down to the floor.  Karen's mother stands up, just taking it.  She's at the top of the stairs.  Karen's Father swings his arm back, and Karen jumps on him.  He shrugs her away violently. 
WITH KAREN 
as she hits the ground and the wall next to Jacob's body. She looks up. 
WIDER 
And Karen's Father is now FREDDY again.  He swings his fist. SMACK! 
Karen's Mother reels from the hit, falls backwards.  Karen jumps up to try and help her, reaching past Freddy.  But it's too late. 
Karen's Mother tumbles down the stairs, head hitting, bones cracking, disappearing into darkness. 
Freddy grabs Karen by the neck and lifts her.  DANGLES her over the top of the steps. 
FREDDY Be honored, bitch.  You're the last soul I need. 
And Jacob RISES UP behind Krueger.  GRABS him.  Freddy DROPS Karen.  She hits hard and rolls down the steps as Freddy turns, his knives swinging out and SLAMMING Jacob's gut one more time, IMPALING him against the wall.  Jacob gasps out his final breath. 
JACOB I'll be back... 
FREDDY I'll be waiting. 
Freddy pulls his blades out of Jacob and the wall.  The boy's body hits the floor for the last time.  Freddy turns back to the stairs and looks down them. 
FREDDY (cont'd) Where's my little pumpkin? 
He strolls down the steps. 
DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY 
Freddy walks down and no one's there.  Karen's Mom was just an illusion, but Karen herself, dead or alive, is nowhere to be seen. 
FREDDY (cont'd) Play time is over, bitch. 
He walks down the hallway.  Eyes darting.  Until a BOOMING VOICE is heard from the kitchen. 
VOICE FREDERICK! 
Freddy cocks his head and frowns. 
VOICE (cont'd) Frederick!  What have you done? 
And, amazingly, a look of FEAR crosses Krueger's face. Something about that voice has struck terror in the heart of the creature that fears nobody. 
Krueger turns to the kitchen door.  A man steps out of the shadows, a big muscular man with a horrifying look in his eyes.  A man we've seen somewhere before - in a picture. 
It's FREDDY'S FOSTER FATHER - MR. UNDERWOOD.  And he looks pissed beyond belief. 
Freddy shrinks back, eyes widening. 
FREDDY Daddy? 
MR. UNDERWOOD Don't you "Daddy" me! 
Mr. Underwood raises his arm and SMACKS Freddy across the skull.  Krueger tumbles back into the hallway.

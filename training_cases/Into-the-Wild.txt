1   EXT. THE STAMPEDE TRAIL - DAY                                    1 
SUPER: Tuesday, April 28th 1992 
WIDE-SHOT: A vast, snow-blanketed wilderness that sits beneath the icy summits of the highest mountain range in North America. This is BIG Alaska. 
A beat up 4x4 pick-up enters very small into the upper left corner of frame on an unkept, snow-packed road, and comes to a stop. A figure exits the passenger side and moves around the front of the truck. We can just make out the rifle sticking out of his backpack. We HEAR a very distant "Thank You" as the figure walks away from the road and away from the truck, seemingly into nowhere. 
DRIVER Hey! 
The figure with backpack and rifle, henceforth BACKPACK, stopping in his tracks, turns around in the direction of the truck. 
DRIVER (CONT'D) Come here. 
BACKPACK walks back to the truck.    As he approaches the driver's door, we 
CUT IN TO: TIGHT SHOT over the back-packed shoulder onto the DRIVER. 
DRIVER (CONT'D) (referring to items we see sitting on dashboard) You left your watch, your comb, your change... 
We STAY on the DRIVER as BACKPACK speaks: 
BACKPACK Keep it. 
DRIVER I don't want your money.    And I already have a watch. 
BACKPACK If you don't take it, I'm gonna throw it away. I don't want to know what time it is, what day it is, or where I am. (MORE) 
BACKPACK (CONT'D) I don't want to see anybody. None of that matters. 
The driver reaches behind the seat of the truck, pulls out an old pair of rubber work boots. 
DRIVER (handing him the boots) Take em. 
There is a pause as Backpack considers accepting the boots. 
DRIVER (CONT'D) If you make it out alive, give me a call, and I'll tell you how to get the boots back to me. 
We can feel over Backpack's shoulder that he has taken the boots and is putting them on but we STAY on the driver. 
BACKPACK Hey, do me a favor, will ya?     Take a picture of me. 
Backpack hands him an Instamatic camera and starts walking backwards. We PULL BACK with him. And he maintains his back to us. When he stops, we CONTINUE until he is FULL-FRAME, head-to-toe from behind, posing. 
CUT TO: 
CU: driver 
CLICK.   He snaps the shot. Backpack re-enters frame in an OVER-SHOULDER.          Driver hands him the camera. 
DRIVER You gonna be alright? 
BACKPACK I'll be better than that. (I'll be who I am.) 
As Backpack exits the frame, we SLOWLY ZOOM past the concerned face of the driver onto the loose change, the comb, and the watch on the dash. 
Throughout the ZOOM, the SOUND of FOOTSTEPS CRUNCHING THE SNOW, FADE into the distance. 
BACK TO: 
ORIGINAL WIDE-SHOT: 
We see the small form of the truck and the smaller form of the Backpacker walking away from the truck until the Backpacker has exited the frame. The truck takes a BEAT, turns around in the snow, and accelerates back into the direction from which it came. As the truck exits frame, we - 
DISSOLVE TO: 
2   EXT. COMMENCEMENT GROUNDS, EMORY UNIVERSITY, ATLANTA -         2 DAY 
SUPER: May 1990 
The crowd of family and friends, and of course, students. Assembled on fold-out chairs. The broad lawn. 
INTERCUT: CHRIS MCCANDLESS. We don't see his face, just feet pounding the pavement at an increasing pace. 
One by one the names of graduates announced. Their bright young faces, capped heads, and gowns, glide up to the podium to accept their diplomas. 
INTERCUT: Chris, on his run, sweatshirt hood over head. Amongst assembled crowd and family we find: THE MCCANDLESS': BILLIE, mid to late forties with dark striking eyes; WALT, a taciturn man, early fifties; and CARINE, eighteen, pretty with her mother's eyes and waist length brown hair, a gold crucifix dangles from her neck. They look around, looking for Chris, he's nowhere in sight. 
INTERCUT: Chris, in a shower (PHOTO-SONICS) He TURNS INTO CAMERA, the water streaming down his face. 
From the announcement podium comes the name of their son and brother, CHRISTOPHER JOHNSON MCCANDLESS. The McCandless family increasingly panicked over Chris' absence, when almost magically, he appears in full cap and gown. 
Disregarding the steps that lead up to the podium platform, the small-framed but athletic CHRIS MCCANDLESS leaps jubilantly onto the stage in a single bound, frightening Billie, a little wince from Walt, and Carine "That's our Chris." And just as quickly as Chris has been handed his diploma, he civilly descends the platform steps. 
TIME CUT: 
CHRIS (CONT'D) But, thanks anyway. 
WALT Everything's gotta be difficult. 
CHRIS I said thank you. I just don't want anything. 
The group returns to some superficial calm. 
CARINE I wouldn't say no to a new car. 
CHRIS (mumbling a rib) Ivana Trump McCandless. CARINE (laughing it off) Shut up, Chris. (to her parents, seriously) Seriously, I'll pay you back. 
CUT TO: 
7   INT. OFF-CAMPUS ROOMING HOUSE, SECOND-FLOOR, ATLANTA -         7 DAY 
OVER Chris' shoulder, he frisbees his graduation cap from the upstairs window to his parents parting Cadillac on the street. 
As they wave goodbye, Carine catches the cap from the backseat window. And with a parting smile to her brother, she poses with it on her own head. Chris smiles and waves goodbye. 
As the Cadillac drifts away, his smile disappears into something other than sadness. 
TIME CUT: 
8   INT. OFF-CAMPUS ROOMING HOUSE - NIGHT                         8 
In a warm ambient light, we SEE a black and white poster on a barren wall: Poncho-clad Clint Eastwood from "The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly." 
We TILT DOWN a stack of books sitting on the floor - Tolstoy, Stegner, Thoreau, Jack London, and Pasternak. Beside them, a camper's backpack. 
Chris sits in introspection at his desk by candlelight. The room is spare, supporting his monkish lifestyle. But on the desk before him, he counts out $500.68 from a bank envelope. He pockets those bills and change, then removes a check for $24,000 made out to OXFAM America from the same bank envelope. He scribbles a note: These are all my savings. Feed someone with it. Signed, Chris McCandless. He then slides the note and the check into a pre-addressed Oxford Famine Relief Fund (in Boston) envelope. 
He pulls his wallet from his back pocket. Pulls all the cards and pictures from its sleeves. Considering each, he flicks them into a trash bin, one by one. Finally coming to his social security card, he holds it to the candles flame. As the flame burns bright we - DISSOLVE TO: 
9   EXT. ATLANTA HIGHWAY - SUNRISE'                               9 
MUSIC (Gordon Peterson's BIG HARD SUN or as radio source Tom Petty's FREE FALLING) rises and PRESENTATION TITLES OVER: 
A 1982 DATSUN B210 emerges from the rising sun as the car heads west out of Atlanta. (HIGHWAY 20 TO 78 TO 40) 
PRESENTATION TITLES and MUSIC carry OVER: 
9A. 
MONTAGE: We travel with Chris and his Datsun through the towns and open highways, landscapes and landmarks, days and nights, that lead to the Mojave desert in the West. 
(In contrast to his introspection of the previous night, Chris is buoyant throughout this sequence.) 
10   EXT. DESERT, SOMEWHERE BETWEEN KINGMAN, ARIZONA AND LAS     10 VEGAS, NEVADA - SUNSET 
(CRANE SHOT) We see Chris stop the Datsun in the middle of the desert road. We (CRANE?) DOWN to a close-up through the windshield. Chris looks left. Then, right. Into the rearview mirror, and suddenly turns the wheel, veering the Datsun off the paved highway into the vast desert. 
As we CRANE back UP, the Datsun moves into the horizon. 
END PRESENTATION TITLES. FADE MUSIC 
11   EXT. DETRITAL WASH - TWILIGHT                               11 
ANGLE: WEST-FACING 
The Datsun sits in the magical pastel twilight just before darkness slides over the desert. It is positioned at the foot of a wash wall that edges the soup bowl. 
ANGLE: EAST-FACING 
The Datsun, a yellow speck in the frame. Coyotes yap at the moon. Other than that, no sound on the desert floor. 
In the distance, voluptuous cumulonimbus clouds boil upward catching the last rosy glow of the west-setting sun over the rim of the upper Detrital watershed. We see strobe bursts of lightning followed by muffled thunder illuminating the thunder clouds from within. Short SERIES OF ANGLES as we MOVE IN on the distant gullies and ravines, starting to run with copious amounts of water. 
12   INT. DATSUN - NIGHT                                         12 
Chris McCandless, in the same clothes he had been in back in the rooming house, sleeps in the back seat of the Datsun. His head supported by his backpack. We begin to HEAR a rumble. But this rumble is not thunder. It rapidly builds into an alarming ROAR. The roar grows to a deafening level. Chris awakens. 
As he peeks up from the backseat looking forward through the windshield, he just barely catches sight of the leading edge of a flash flood. A four-foot high wall of water, mud and debris makes impact with the Datsun, momentarily enveloping it in water. Suddenly the car is SLAMMED against the cliff. CRACK! Chris sits upright, disoriented. 
POV: As far as the eye can see in the desert moonlight, water has taken over the desert with a flash flood. 
However, there's no panic in Chris' face as we observe him past a new crack in the wet windshield. The water, while violent seems to have topped off just above the wheels. Chris gets a slight smile on his face, as the car settles into its new position below the cliff. He returns to sleep. 
CUT TO: 
13   EXT. DESERT - DAY                                          13 
What remains of Chris' travelling money burns in a pile beside the Datsun on the sun-lit but muddy desert floor. 
We follow a very long set of footprints (CAMERA TRACKING/TRUE VERTICAL) away from the burning cash through the mud, finally tilting up to the footprint maker, Chris. Slogging toward high ground. 
WIDE-SHOT: We see the abandoned Datsun nearly a mile behind Chris as he walks toward us wearing his backpack. He comes very close to camera (only a day or two's stubble on his face) and as we PAN him 180, we see as much wilderness before us as we did behind. REPRISE MUSIC OVER MAIN TITLE: 
(INTO THE WILD) Chris walks into the distance. 
COMPLETE AND END MAIN TITLES.

ECU: CHRIS' EYES 
Delirious in the heat, we WIDEN OUT to see that he's filthy (2 weeks of growth on his face and naked.) He makes his way out of the tent, peers at the relentless sun and scurries to his backpack where he removes a canteen, barely a sip of water left in it. He downs it. TIME CUT: 
17   EXT. LAKE MEAD DAY                                         17 
The following short vignettes are silent and focused exclusively on Chris: 
1. Recreational BOATERS on Lake Mead. GIRLS in bikinis. BOYS on boats eating Kentucky Fried Chicken.

2. At lake-side, an unusual sight - the NEW Chris McCandless, a sun and dirt-beaten bum with a backpack.

Chris brushes his teeth. 
CHRIS (V.O.) I need a name. 
He takes a swallow of water. Rinses his mouth. Spits it out. Then checks his bearded face in the mirror. He likes what he sees. 
As he wipes the corners of his mouth with a tissue and throws it into the bin below the sink, he notices a discarded tube of lipstick. He picks it up. It's down to its end. Yet with what lipstick remains, he writes on the mirror:

VARIOUS shots to accompany V.O. 
CARINE (V.O.) Toward the end of June, Chris had mailed our parents his final grade report. 
Walt and Billie open the envelope. 
CARINE (V.O.) (CONT'D) Almost all A's. "A" in Apartheid in South African Society and History of Anthropological Thought; A- in Contemporary African Politics and the Food Crisis in Africa; and on it went. Clever boy, my brother. 
We observe Carine in a delicate afternoon light. She is sitting up on her bed with an unread book, looking out the window toward us. 
CARINE (V.O.) (CONT'D) But by the end of July we hadn't heard anything from him and my parents were getting very worried. 
Carine's POV:   Walt with his arm around Billie in the yard. 
CARINE (V.O.) (CONT'D) Chris had never had a phone, so they decided to drive down to Atlanta and surprise him. CUT TO: 
22A   EXT. ROAD TO TAHOE                                        22A 
Chris, backpack on, walking away from camera. 
CUT TO: 
23    EXT. HIGHWAY - ATLANTA - DAY (END JULY 1990)               23 
We see Walt and Billie's car pass under an Atlanta mileage sign. 
CARINE (V.O.) When they arrived at the apartment, there was a "For Rent" sign in his window, and the manager told my parents that Chris had moved out at the end of June. 
24   EXT. OFF-CAMPUS ROOMING HOUSE, ATLANTA - DAY                24 
We observe Walt and Billie chatting with Chris' apartment manager. 
CARINE (V.O.) When they got home, I had to hand them all the letters they had sent Chris that summer which had been returned in a bundle. 
25   INT. MCCANDLESS HOME, ANNANDALE                             25 
The bundle of letters are splayed out on the kitchen table - "Return to Sender" stamps visible. 
CARINE (V.O.) Chris had instructed the post office to hold them until August 1st so that mom and dad wouldn't know that anything was up. Some part of me understood what he had done. That he had spent the previous four years fulfilling an absurd and onerous duty in graduating from college.

DRIVER This is where I turn off. 
CHRIS Alright man.    Thanks a lot. 
Chris is dropped off. The driver veers off the highway and into the distance. Chris is left behind to hitch another ride. 
36A   EXT. HIGHWAY                                              36A 
CAMERA is across the road from Chris as one by one cars pass him by. He turns to move north by foot and we track with him, his back to oncoming traffic, he continues to hitchhike with an extended thumb. Something catches his eye in the treeline beside the road. 
REVERSE: Chris, moving to the mysterious object. As he lifts it, we see that it is a goofy looking straw hat. He dusts it off, and snugs it onto his head, when a police car comes into frame and stops beside Chris. 
With a quick blast of the siren, Chris turns to regard the police car. The POLICEMAN gets out of the car and moves to Chris. 
POLICEMAN How're you doin' this evening? 
CHRIS (reluctantly) I'm alright. What's the matter? 
POLICEMAN You wanna put your backpack down on the hood of my car. 
Chris does not oblige. 
CHRIS Why? 
POLICEMAN Because I asked you to, sir. 
CHRIS But I haven't done anything wrong.   These are my personal items. 
POLICEMAN Do you know that it's unlawful to hitchhike on this stretch of highway. CHRIS You're kidding. 
POLICEMAN Do you see a safe area for a vehicle to stop? We got a tree-lined highway without a substantial shoulder here. And we've had a lot of accidents on this road from people stopping in the traffic lane for hitchhikers. 
CHRIS Alright, but...I mean, you stopped your car. You're in the traffic lane. And you can see, there's hardly any cars out here. Plus, it's a straight road; you can see for a long ways. (MORE) 
CHRIS (CONT'D) (in disbelief) There's really been accidents along here? 
POLICEMAN May I see some identification? 
Now Chris is worried. 
CHRIS I don't have any. 
POLICEMAN You don't have any identification? 
Chris shakes his head "No." 
POLICEMAN (CONT'D) (pulling out a ticket) Well, I'm gonna site you for unlawful hitchhiking. You don't have to appear. You can send a check directly to the Humboldt County Clerks Office for restitution. If you don't pay it within 30 days, you're subject to fine and warrant. I'm gonna trust that you're gonna give me accurate information. What's your name? 
Chris can't bring himself to lie. 
CHRIS (a beat) McCandless. Christopher Johnson McCandless. 
CUT TO: 
37   INT. MCCANDLESS HOME, ANNANDALE (MID-AUGUST 1990)          37 
Walt, Billie, and Carine sit around the kitchen table in August. A copy of Chris' ticket has been sent to the Annandale address and sits before them. Billie and Carine sit silently. Walt's on the phone. 
CARINE (V.O.) If Chris were trying to disappear, it would have been a pretty uncharacteristic lapse for him to give the police his real place of residence. Though my parents had already contacted the Annandale police with their initial concerns, this ticket arriving from California made them frantic. (MORE) 
CARINE (V.O.) (CONT'D) My father called one of his old government friends who put him in touch with a private investigator, someone who'd done work with the DIA and the CIA. Using the Willow Creek ticket as a starting point, the investigator began chasing down leads. Most of them led far afield -- to Europe and South Africa. Ultimately turning up nothing. What my dad couldn't believe was that he'd given up his car. He seemed to love that Datsun so much. It sounded just like Chris to me, though. He was very much of the school that you should own nothing except what you could carry on your back at a dead run. 
38   EXT. NORTHERN CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY, NEAR ORICK, 60 MILES     38 SOUTH OF THE OREGON LINE - DAY (MID-AUGUST 1990) 
With his backpack lunging and a free hand holding his goofy new hat onto his head, we find Chris at a "dead run" to catch a ride that had overshot him. (Director's note: Don't leave this image too soon.) An old van idles waiting for him. As he gets to the passenger side, the woman passenger gets out. This is JAN BURRES, early 40's, looks to be still on the long road home from Woodstock. A little heavyset, dark wavy hair with a lot of premature grey in it. 
Jan moving to the side door. 
JAN Hi. We just barely saw you there, under that crazy hat of yours. We couldn't back up - the van's reverse is broken. CHRIS (as Jan fiddles with side door handle) Oh.   That's okay. Thanks for stopping. 
JAN This door's a little tricky, I'll get it. 
And with a little pulling, it opens. Indicating the pony- tailed and bearded driver (RAINEY), early 50's, definitely Woodstock... 
JAN (CONT'D) Hop in, that's Rainey. 
RAINEY Hey, I'm Rainey. 
JAN And I'm Jan. 
CHRIS Hey, Rainey.    Hi Jan.    I'm Alex. 
RAINEY Alex of the hat. 
CHRIS (closing the side door) Yeah. 
RAINEY Well, my friend, all is not well on the hippie front. 
Chris pulls out his pocketknife, cuts the twine that binds the firewood to his body, and takes a seat beside Rainey. 
RAINEY (CONT'D) You're an industrious little fucker, aren't ya... Yeah, it's funny how things happen at particular times. I've loved that woman for a lot of years. But you know, she's got a...story. We've been going through this thing real quietly cause, well...So, after running into you last night, this thing we were going through quietly, she started talking about. You know what I mean? 
CHRIS I think so. 
RAINEY You think what? 
Chris is looking off at Jan walking in the distance. 
CHRIS I think she's probably quietly disconnecting. It doesn't feel right to her to be close to you if there's a hole of some kind somewhere else. 
RAINEY That's a helluva insight. Jesus!... You're not Jesus, are you? You gonna walk on that water and get her back for me? 
CHRIS Actually, I'm a little afraid of water. 
Rainey gives him a sideways glance. 
CHRIS (CONT'D) It's true. But it's something I've got to get over sometime. (MORE) 
CHRIS (CONT'D) So, I'll swim in it if you'll carry the firewood back to the campsite. 
RAINEY I'll carry.   Shit-yes I'll carry. 
And with that, Chris runs down the beach toward Jan. Rainey watches Chris and Jan chat briefly. Then they strip down to their underwear and jump into the ocean, splashing and laughing. 
ANGLE: Rainey. A warmth comes over him, watching his old lady having some fun. He grabs two armfuls of wood and heads to the campsite. 
ANGLE: Chris and Jan swimming in the chilly water, having a ball. 
Jan increasingly indulges herself a motherly closeness and joy with Chris. And Chris allows it. She pushes the stringy hairs from his eyes, worries when he descends below the surface for too many seconds, and smiles and laughs in tender relief when from below surface one of her toes is pulled on by the big fish Chris. As he re- surfaces, she gives him a splash right in the face. 
TIME CUT: 
43   EXT. CAMPSITE, ORICK BEACH - LATER                          43 
Through a burning campfire in the late afternoon, we see the chilly bodies of Chris and Jan carrying their clothes run shivering toward us. 
Rainey sits beside the campfire. RAINEY I thought you guys might need a little heat. 
Jan smiles appreciatively. 
JAN (moving to Rainey) That's not hot enough. Put your arms around me. 
As they embrace, Chris throws a coat on from his tent, puts on his funny straw hat, and grabs a book. 
Rainey has wrapped a blanket around Jan and they sit beside the fire. 
CHRIS I'm going to go down the beach a ways and read a little bit. I'll bring the rest of that wood back before nightfall. 
RAINEY Alright. We might take a run into town to grab some food for tonight. 
CHRIS Sounds good. 
He heads off down the beach.

2. Seagulls, gliding inches over the water. 
3. The breeze on the sea grass. 
4. Chris in his big hat reading at water's edge. 
5. Jan and Rainey deeply engaged in conversation beside the fire. 
6. Chris closing his book, remaining meditative at water's edge.

Jan and Rainey on a blanket sharing a joint. Chris lying beside the campfire in his sleeping bag. Jan takes a toke, passes the joint to Rainey. 
JAN You know what Alex ought to do, Rainey? He ought to come out to the Slabs this winter. 
RAINEY Oh yeah. 
Rainey takes a toke on the joint. 
RAINEY (CONT'D) You'd like that if you're still on the road. Lot of fellow travelers. 
Rainey offers the joint to Chris.   Chris passes it up with a hand gesture. 
CHRIS What is that? The Slabs? 
RAINEY It's down in Niland, California.   You know where the Salton Sea is? 
ALL "Pot o Gold.    Gotta get that pot o gold!"

A series of silent, quaint establishing tableaus. (Director's Note:    Condor above street) 
It's a sleepy little town. Population: 274. Cluster of clapboard houses, tiny yards, and weathered brick storefronts rising humbly from the immensity of the northern plains. Stately rows of cottonwoods shade a grid of streets, seldom disturbed by moving vehicles. 
From UNDER CAMERA, the series of tableaus is interrupted as the convoy roars into our frame from BENEATH CAMERA.

WAYNE Okay Kevin, get all the machines back to the elevator. I'm gonna show Chris to his room. 
KEVIN (O.S.) (over CB) I've got dibs on that shower, that shower's all me.

Wayne opens the door at the top of the stairs.

Wayne plops Chris' pack beside a single bed in the tiny but comfortable room. Chris enters, very happy with his new quarters. 
WAYNE Shower's down the hall. If you hurry you can beat the rest of the boys to it. But you do want to grab a shower cause we're all heading over to the Cabaret in exactly thirty-six minutes. So, get your dancing shoes on. There's foo-foo in the medicine cabinet. I think it's Brut. (slaps his own face as if he's putting on cologne) Then you want to put your charm in overdrive cause we like to PAH-TAY! 
Wayne gives Chris a wink and exits, shutting the door behind him. 
Chris takes in his new surroundings. He's on a work crew and he likes it. Chris makes the move for the shower but by the time he opens his door to the hall, all the other crew members are barreling up the stairs in front of them, clamoring for dibs (Chris' POV) MAN #1 I got first! 
MAN #2 (in a kid voice) You had first last night! 
MAN #1 (entering the bathroom) Well, if you wanna wash my back, cowboy... 
MAN #2 You go ahead, fairy.    Just don't use all the soap. 
ANGLE: Chris. He gets a kick out of these guys.    He closes the door.

The Jack Daniels is flowing. Wayne's crew drinks, smokes, and strikes out with every fat woman in the place. GAIL BORAH, an on-again, off-again girlfriend of Wayne's tends bar. A petite sad-eyed woman, slight as a heron, delicate features and long blond hair. Wayne and Chris sit at the end of the bar. 
WAYNE Alex, this is Gail . This is the one to go to for that White Russian you've been wanting. Of course the quid pro quo can be hazardous. 
GAIL Shut up, Wayne. (to Chris) You want a White Russian, sweetie? 
CHRIS (shyly) Yes please, ma'am. 
WAYNE Yes please, ma'am? 
Wayne slaps Chris on the back. WAYNE (CONT'D) Ain't he great? GAIL (to Chris) Don't pay any attention to him. 
With that Wayne reaches over the bar, grabs Gail and gets her in a lip-lock, to which she ultimately gives in.

CHRIS I've been thinking a lot about Alaska. 
GAIL Alaska? What kind of nut-nut are you? Alex, it's October for Christ's sake. You go to Alaska, you go in the Spring. This time of year you wanna head south. Personally, I like Las Vegas. One-armed bandit. That's what I like. 
CHRIS Yeah, maybe I ought to put off going to Alaska, at least so I can get settled up there in decent weather. 
GAIL South. You want to go south. You want me to take you out to the highway? 
CHRIS (putting on his cowboy) Little lady, I walked in, I can walk out. He puts a few bills down on the bar, saddles up his backpack, and gives Gail a hug. 
GAIL You take care of yourself now, Alex. You got a whole family here depending on it. 
CHRIS I will. Thanks Gail .   And tell Wayne, I'll drop him a line. 
He gives her a kiss on the cheek and he's off.

We HEAR passing cars humming above. Chris has set up camp and he's digging in the dirt. He buries many of his belongings. He makes sure he's got his check from working with Wayne in his pocket. He packs only the essential items, burying all else. He gets into his sleeping bag and goes to sleep.

Chris approaches the GREEN-SUITED FUNCTIONARY at the front desk. 
GREEN SUIT Can I help you? 
CHRIS Yeah. If I wanted to paddle down the river, where's the best place to launch out of? 
GREEN SUIT "To launch out of?" What's your experience level? 
CHRIS Not much. 
GREEN SUIT Any?   Do you have a permit? 
CHRIS A permit for what? GREEN SUIT You can't paddle down the river without a permit. If you like, you can apply for one here, get yourself some experience, and I'll put you on the wait-list. 
CHRIS Wait-list?   To paddle down a river? 
GREEN SUIT That's right. 
CHRIS (giggling) Well, how long do you have to wait? 
GREEN SUIT I've got an opening May 2003. 
CHRIS (laughing) Twelve years? 
GREEN SUIT Well, you could always join a commercial raft trip and go with a licensed guide. They usually have a few last minute cancellations. I think it's about two- thousand dollars. 
Chris busts a gut. 
CHRIS Thanks for your help. 
The Green Suit eyes Chris' departure with suspicion. 
CUT TO: 
SONJA Las Vegas is very nice.   The universe is very good. 
59A. 
MADS And then, we come here.   Maybe you go to Mexico. (MORE) 
MADS (CONT'D) You can take kayak around Lake Mead and then take the river down to Mexico. 
Chris likes the idea. 
CHRIS How far are we from Lake Mead? 
MADS Sonja, how far is Hoover Dam? 
Sonja grabs a map from the tent, opens and scrutinizes it. We follow her finger tracing the river. 
SONJA Maybe three hundred thirty kilometers...like two hundred miles. 
Sonja walks the map over to Chris at water's edge and hands it to him. He studies it. 
CHRIS Man, I wonder if I could go all the way down into the Gulf of California. 
Chris traces his finger along the impossibly long route leading to El Golfo de Santa Clara. 
MADS (entering the water with Chris' hotdog) I go with you. We leave Sonja here.    You and me in kayak - we go to Mexico. 
SONJA (in Danish) You're embarrassing.   Idiot. Mads with a burst of re-exhilaration, grabs Chris' hand, shaking it violently. 
MADS I like the meeting you. 
CHRIS Thank you. I'm very happy to meet both of you too. 
Sonja heads back for her hotdog taking her T-shirt off on the move. Chris is about to bust a gut. Sonja returns to her sunbathing. These two are a hoot. 
60A. 
Just then, something catches Chris' attention upriver. We can just barely make out the SOUNDS of a jet boat motor. His eyes narrow a bit, then - 
CHRIS (CONT'D) Well, guys I really appreciate the hospitality but I wanna make camp down- river a ways so I better take off before dark. 
CUT TO: 
86   EXT. COLORADO RIVER - MOMENTS LATER                        86 
Chris, back in the kayak is paddling down river. Mads and Sonja on the bank, wave a boisterous goodbye. And they just keep waving. And Chris keeps waving until he has drifted out of sight, when around the upriver bend arrive the RIVER PATROL. 
At river's edge, Mads, thinking quickly, waves for their attention. Pointing the river patrol back upriver, he yells: 
MADS He went thattaway!   The crazy man - he went thattaway! 
And miraculously, the river patrol makes an about face and heads in the opposite direction of Chris. Suddenly Sonja thinks Mads is the most clever man on earth. As she jumps his bones right there on the river's edge - 
SONJA Just like in the movies. 
CUT TO: 
87   EXT. DESERT ROAD, NEAR HOOVER DAM - DAY                     87 
Chris and the kayak are in the back of a pick-up truck heading down river by road. We pass the Hoover Dam. 
CARINE (V.O.) It would be Christmas in a couple of months. And the last news we'd had was about his car being found. I woke up a couple of days ago, and for the first time, I was surprised to realize that it wasn't only my parents who hadn't heard from Chris. I wondered why he hadn't tried to call in case I might answer. He could've hung up if it wasn't me. 
88   EXT. COLORADO RIVER, TOPOCK, ARIZONA - DAY                  88 
Chris is re-stocked on some food items which he packs in his bag and shoves into the bow of the kayak. This lower stretch of the river has little in common with the unbridled torrent that explodes through the Grand Canyon. Emasculated by dams and diversion canals, the lower Colorado burbles indolently from reservoir to reservoir, through some of the hottest, starkest, most austere country on the continent. 
CARINE But why he didn't send a letter, maybe through a friend. I got mad. But I told myself it was good. It made me remember that there was something more than rebellion, more than anger that was driving him. Chris had always been driven, had always been an adventurer. When he was four years old... 
89    EXT. DARK NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - NIGHT                       89

As Chris paddles downstream with Mexico in his sights, he is stirred by the saline beauty and the clean slant of light. (Director's Note: ANGLE over Chris ONTO water reflecting the landscape and diamond flashes of sunlight.) 
CARINE Whatever drawer he was opening now must have something sweet in it.

Chris floats in SLO-MO through the air, his hair wisping skyward. 
63A. 
As he pierces feet first, a clear blue surface of the river's water, CAMERA goes UNDERWATER with him and follows him in CU as he surfaces, jubilant in the beauty of the Topock gorge. He shakes the water out of his hair. 
CHRIS (V.O.) (CONT'D) After the river dried up, I ported the kayak and got a lift to Golfo. 
101   EXT. FISHING VILLAGE, EL GOLFO DE SANTA CLARA - DAY        101 
We see Chris jump down off the back of the duck hunter's truck. He slides the kayak off the truck bed onto the street. Chris goes into his pocket, pulls out a sealed sandwich bag of cash. He tries to pay the hunters for their time but they refuse the money. Nonetheless, Chris is insistent and they relent. 
Chris pulls his backpack from inside the bow and saddles it up on his shoulders. The hunters pull away.

CHRIS (V.O.) I paddled south about 20 miles.

See the ocean and sand, wind whipping them. CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal Chris in a cave where he has made camp; watching, waiting. 
CHRIS (V.O.) A sandstorm hit and I was pretty much stuck. My kayak blew away, so I left it and walked up the beach, hitched back north, and here I am.

IMMIGRATION OFFICER 36 days, wow. I guess they're gonna have to watch that spillway a little better. 
CHRIS What they ought to do is open up the dams and let the rivers flow. 
IMMIGRATION OFFICER I can't disagree with you on that. Okay, Alexander SuperTramp. I think we're gonna let you out of here shortly but you've got two working weeks to get an ID card in the United States. You can't be crossing these borders without identification, are we understood? 
CHRIS Yes, sir. I've eaten enough sand to send me back to the city anyway.

116   EXT. TRAIN YARD, SOMEWHERE NEAR ALGODONES - NIGHT         116 
A freight train cranks up its great engines and starts its move west. 
Chris POV: We see a BULL (hobo slang for a railway security guard) making his rounds. As the bull disappears around the caboose, and the trains motion picks up, Chris appears from behind a fuel pump. He makes his move in the shadows to the passing freight cars, not quite sure how to board them. He begins to slowly jog beside the train. There is a vertical steel rod on each passing car. He times the train by putting his hand out and letting the vertical rods slap it. 
CHRIS (counting) One...Two...Three - 
71A. 
And with that he accelerates to a run, throws his pack into the moving freight car before him, simultaneously leaping up to grab the rail and throw himself into the car. 
But his left foot misses and he's suddenly dangling from the moving train. He grabs hand over hand on the rail. 
ANGLE: Dangling feet and razor sharp wheels. 
ANGLE: Chris. He puts everything into pulling himself up, growling the strength into his muscles finally... 
117   INT. FREIGHT CAR - NIGHT                                  117 
As Chris rolls forward into the car -- he made it! 
CHRIS As Alexander Supertramp returns to civilization...a hobo. (quietly) I'm a for real hobo. 
He's very happy about this (despite the near surrender of it.) Chris uses his pack as a pillow, lays back on it and begins to sing Roger Miller's King of the Road.

Chris goes into his pack, grabs his canteen and drinks some water. Mid-sip, the train begins to make a surprising stop. Screeching wheels on track. Chris is alarmed. As he moves to peer out the door, even before he has a chance to see what's coming -- WHAM! He's smashed in the head with a baton. A BULL jumps into the car with him. 
BULL #2 Lay down on your stomach, spread eagle! 
Chris turns to reason with the man. And that's all it takes -- six straight blows to the ribs, legs, and arms. We hear it more than we see it. Chris is in agony. 
BULL #2 (CONT'D) Let me see your face. 
The bull shines a flashlight into Chris' eyes. 
BULL #2 (CONT'D) I never, ever, ever forget a face. If I see yours again, I won't arrest you. I'll kill you. This is the god-damned railroad. And we will do whatever we have to, to keep you freeloaders from violating our liability. 
Chris is trying to understand what the man is saying. 
BULL #2 (CONT'D) If one of you people gets hurt on our train, we are liable. Do you understand that? 
CHRIS (despite the violent irony) I'm sorry, sir. 
BULL #2 You have I.D.? 
CHRIS No, sir. 
BULL #2 Of course you don't. CUT TO:

Chris hops out of a Camaro that gave him a ride.   The lighting is anonymous and so is the driver. 
CHRIS Thanks very much. 
He closes the door and the car drives off. We follow Chris as he goes to the overpass edge. He drops his pack over the side. Chris climbs down the edge of the overpass, grabs his pack, and scurries into the UNDERPASS below. (We suddenly recognize this as his pre-river run campsite) 
He digs up his buried belongings, returning them to his pack. Last to come out of the ground, Chris' copy of Jack London's Call of the Wild. He pulls off a temp wrapping and dusts it off. Chris lights his candle lantern and begins to read. O.S. VOICES from the PAST:

ELEVEN-YEAR OLD CARINE sits in the stairwell leading to her parent's room where an argument ensues. Carine's head in her hands, a delicate tear moistens the webs between her small fingers. 
FIFTEEN-YEAR OLD CHRIS enters from O.S. He leans against the stairwell and looks up the stairs. Our focus remains on Carine. In the B.G. SOFT FOCUS, Walt is pinning Billie down onto the bed. She flails at him but he holds down her shoulders. 
WALT LOOK WHAT YOUR MOTHER IS MAKING ME DO! 
Billie slips his grasp. Walt reaches out with a hit/push of her back. She is thrust out of the bedroom onto the landing above the staircase followed by Walt who positions himself in the doorway like a hostile crucifixion. 
WALT (CONT'D) (raging) I'll just cancel Christmas then! 
Billie returns to him, punching on his chest: 
BILLIE Who do you think you are?   God? 
WALT Yes.   I'm God! 
Chris puts his hand out to Carine. She looks up to him. He gives her a smile and a wink. She takes his hand and they exit frame as the argument continues.

JAN I wasn't much older than Tracy when I got             * pregnant. And I thought my husband and I were going to invent peace on earth and stay together forever. But it didn't work out that way. He left. History. Now ancient history. And that was the end of that. So, I raised Reno by myself - that's my son. Then I met Rainey. And that was really good for a while. But Reno was already a teenager and was becoming a man in his own way. And then, I don't know. He kinda followed in his father's footsteps - out the door and gone. And I really don't know where he is. I haven't heard from him in two years. 
CHRIS I hope I get to meet him sometime. Jan looks into Chris' eyes and smiles with pure love. She leans over and gently kisses Chris on the cheek. 
JAN Do your folks know where you are?

TRACY                                    * Soup's on. Oh, I'm sorry.   Are you guys getting heavy? 
JAN No, sweetheart. Just hungry. You've been doing a fantastic job over there. (to Chris) Shall we eat?

RAINEY I really ought to get myself doing that. 
CHRIS You should Rainey. Makes that Tantric stuff go even better. 
RAINEY How the hell would you know? That poor girl over there is about ready to vault onto a fence post. And here you are, the monk of Jack LaLane. 
They share a laugh. Chris comes to the end of his sit- ups. Wipes his brow with a towel. Rainey squats down next to him. 
RAINEY (CONT'D) I guess Jan filled you in. About Reno and everything. Children can be harsh judges when it comes to their parents. They don't grant clemency easily. I think Reno tended to see things in black and white. I just hope he lives long enough to forgive her. 
The connection is not lost on Chris. 
RAINEY (CONT'D) But painful as it is, you turned a light on in her and I'm grateful. 
CHRIS Me too. 
RAINEY For what? 
Chris doesn't answer. A kid rides by on a bright new Big Wheel. Must be from the rich side of the commune. 
RAINEY (CONT'D) Do your folks know where you are? CHRIS No. 
RAINEY Don't you think they ought to? 
CHRIS They should. But I can't. Not yet, anyway. I got a sister though, Carine. She's the most beautiful girl in the world. But, it's all got to stay behind me until I get where I'm going. 
RAINEY Alaska? 
CHRIS Yeah, Rainey. Alaska. 
Rainey won't intrude any further. He just nods. Chris notices Tracy in the door of her parent's rig, stealthily       * waving him over. Chris gives Rainey the "Uh-oh" look, pulls on his T-shirt, and walks over to the rig. Tracy          * has disappeared inside.

The whole point was to run until they were completely lost and so exhausted that they were on the verge of puking. Then they'd slow down a little, somehow he'd find their bearings, and lead them home again at full speed. This was my brothers idea of fun. 
We FAVOR Chris as he jogs in place at the exhilarating point of being lost. When he has identified a most likely return route, he quickens his pace, leading the group in the direction of return.

Chris heads out with his last Burger King check in hand, proudly wearing his new hat and in search of mountains to climb. 
CARINE (V.O.) A year and a half into Chris' disappearance, each day that goes by now feels like two. Dad calls it "suspended animation." I kept telling myself that he had to get lost to prove his independence to himself. But this was no day run for the Road Warriors and after so much time, I could no longer keep out the haunting thoughts. 
172   EXT. MARKET/POST OFFICE, SALTON CITY - DAY                172 
Chris, with pack and new hat walks away from camera toward the interstate and the brittle mountains beyond. 
CARINE (V.O.) In many ways, my life and even my parents had begun to move in new directions. I'd fallen in love. And mom and dad had even ventured out on a brief vacation. But, when a search of tax records uncovered Chris' contribution to OXFAM, the weight of his disappearance just seemed to lie down on us full length. 
CHAPTER 5: GETTING OF WISDOM DISSOLVE TO: 
173   EXT. BADLANDS OF ANZA-BORREGO DESERT STATE PARK - DAY     173 (JANUARY 1992) 
WIDE SHOT: We see the Oh My God Hot Springs. Steaming pools lined with rocks and shaded by palm trees. A small group of campers and Charlie Manson wannabes in FOREGROUND. 
We ZOOM past them to the sheer rock faces and landforms of the badlands, several miles beyond. 
CUT TO: 
174   EXT. STONE WALL, ANZA-BORREGO DESERT - DAY                174 
SLO MO: We are looking down a radically steep rock face. A shirtless Chris is in training running towards us under the hot desert sun. 
We HEAR only breath and footsteps. 
CUT TO: 
175   EXT. CHRIS' CAMP BESIDE THE STONE WALL - DAY              175 
Chris rests on the sand under a tarp, hung from a Creosote branch. A plate of beans and rice eaten nearly clean and an empty water jug beside him. Flies buzz and pick.

Chris on a morning jog, wearing a shoulder bag and carrying an empty water jug. A quick wave to one of his distant "neighbors" at the spring's camp as he runs by. CUT TO: 
177   EXT. PAVED TWO-LANE ROAD INTO SALTON CITY - DAY           177 
Chris continues his jog, cars whisk by and dust kicks into the air. But Chris is undeterred, keeps running. 
178   EXT. MARKET/POST OFFICE, SALTON CITY - SAME               178 
Chris approaches, slowing his jog to a walk. Chris sets down his water jug and stretches his calves. In the distance we see the peaks of the badlands landforms from where he ran. 
Chris shakes off the jog, picks up the jug, and we go with him around the side of the building. There's a water faucet dripping slowly into the desert mud. Chris pops his jug under it and fills it up. 
CUT TO: 
179   INT. MARKET/POST OFFICE - SAME                           179 
Chris walks the aisles, sipping from his jug, as he comes across bags of rice on the market shelves. A HEAVY SET GIRL passes him in the aisle with her well-mannered dog following her. 
CHRIS (no high-pitched pet voice) Hey boy. You are a handsome fellow. (over shoulder to the girl) Beautiful dog. 
THE GIRL Thank you. 
As the girl continues on, the dog wants to stay with Chris. 
CHRIS Go on, boy.    Go on. 
And the dog obeys him. 
As he sorts through the various rice selections, brown, white, wild, we notice a MAN peering over the opposite shelf at Chris. This is RON FRANZ, between 70 and 80 years old, six-feet, thick arms, barrel chest, and large ears. He wears old jeans, an immaculate white T-shirt, a decorative tooled leather belt, white socks, and scuffed black loafers. His deeply pitted nose demonstrates a purple filigree of veins which unfold like an finely wrought tattoo. And on either side of it, the wary blue eyes of a soldier. He is the archetypical American man. Chris has caught his sympathetic eye. Chris moves to the counter to pay for rice.

In WIDE SHOT, we watch Chris from behind, walking out across the two-lane road. He puts out his thumb to hitch a ride. 
When a truck comes from BEHIND INTO FRAME heading straight for Chris, the truck makes a relaxed L-turn, pulling up beside Chris. 
181   INT. RON'S TRUCK                                          181 
RON Where's your camp? 
CHRIS (pointing) Out past Oh-My-God Hot Springs. 
RON I've lived in and around here six years now and I've never heard of any place that goes by that name. 
Ron leans across the bench seat of the truck, opening up the passenger door. 
RON (CONT'D) Show me how to get there. 
Chris smiles and follows Ron.       As they approach the bottom of the hill - 
RON (CONT'D) How about you and me take a drive? About fifty miles or so up highway, I know a place that's got a view, great food, and requires no climbing. How's that sound? 
Chris thinks about it.     Then - 
CHRIS Yeah, sure. It'll take me a couple of minutes to clean up. 
RON Fair enough.

MUSIC OVER: As Chris and Ron ride the tram to the peak, we watch Chris watching Ron, his kind, moist old eyes, slowly blinking at the wonder of the nature around him. Other passengers on the tram seem nervous, but Ron is meditative, almost hypnotized. 
And with each roll-through of the tram through the cable towers, the tram car rocks and sways, but Ron's peace goes unbroken. And Chris continues to admire the gentle blinking of his eyes. 
CUT TO: 
190   INT. ELEVATION RESTAURANT (SAN JACINTO SUMMIT) - TWILIGHT90 
The two of them sit in a quiet, corner   booth of the tramway eatery that sits on the summit   of San Jacinto overlooking the lights of Palm Springs   and the desert clear back to Salton Sea. Chris is on    a roll. 
CHRIS How old are you, Mr. Franz? 
RON Seventy-nine years old. 
CHRIS Seventy-nine...see, all due respect, but the real difference between people is the quality of their soul and not on how long they've trudged around like a dip-shit. 
Ron laughs. 
CHRIS (CONT'D) But it's true. 
RON It is.   No question about that. 
Ron continues to let Chris vent. CHRIS The government's the same as my parents. They don't respect anybody. Regulation. Regulation. Regulation. WE can't do this. But THEY can do that. I mean, the hypocrisy of the whole...culture.   Makes me crazy. My father was having children                * with two women at the same time, and then              * has the gall to think that he can be of some guidance to me? Make judgments on me? My mother, of course, goes along with all of it. Keeps the secret, which of course, makes my whole life a fiction. Everything I thought was, wasn't. They're such fools! Fucking idiots! 
RON Alex, please don't lump me in amongst your judges. And your tyrants. But I'd prefer to not hear that kind of language. 
CHRIS (realizing his slip) Sorry. I don't usually use that kind of language either. I just get so angry thinking about it. 
Ron reaches across the table.    Puts his sturdy hand on Chris' shoulder. 
RON You got a lot of passion, young man. 
Chris smiles at Ron. 
CUT TO: 
191   EXT. CHRIS' CAMP BESIDE THE STONE WALL - NIGHT             191 
As Ron and Chris pull up in the pick-up truck, we see SPORADIC FIREWORKS WHISTLING AND CRACKLING into the air above the hot-springs, and HEAR the distant HOOTING of its inhabitants. Chris hops out and walks around to Ron's side of the truck. 
CHRIS Awww, that was a great time Mr. Franz. Thank you. 
RON Look here. If Charles Manson and his buddies don't kill me on my way out of here, I'd like to cook you up a home cooked meal tomorrow night. If I come out here about, say, four o'clock tomorrow, how would that be? 
CHRIS That would be swell. 
Ron is thrilled. 
RON Good, good. I'm no gourmet but I know where the spices are. Good night, kid. 
CHRIS Good night Mr. Franz. 
And with that, Ron hits the road.

RON (O.S) How about some fishing? 
Chris turns to the voice. And down at the bottom of the rock wall beside the campsite, is Ron holding up two fishing poles. RON (CONT'D) (referring to the Sea) That thing's twice as salty as the ocean. Did you know that? 
Chris has barely the breath to speak. 
CHRIS Anything alive in it? 
Ron shrugs his shoulders in a "who cares?" fashion. Chris laughs but nods in the affirmative and gives Ron the thumbs up.

BEGIN MUSIC OVER:   MONTAGE: 
1. Chris and Ron fishing in the Salton Sea. (no catch) 
2. At Ron's workshop/garage, Ron guides Chris in his leather belt project. 
3. At Chris' campsite, Chris does push-ups while Ron sits on the tailgate of his truck spying on the "Manson family" through binoculars, shaking his head. 
4. Chris at his campsite working on the belt by campfire light. We MOVE IN on the belt, he's beginning to form the letter N in the leather. 
5. Chris jogging in the morning beside Oh-My-God Hot Springs. 
6. Chris and Ron at the leather bench in Ron's workshop/garage. 
In a EXTREME CLOSE-UP, MUSIC FADES OUT as we PAN across Chris' leather belt and the story being told on it through the engravings:

ALEX is inscribed at the belt's left end; then the initials C.J.M. (for Christopher Johnson McCandless) frame a skull and crossbones. Across the strip of cowhide one sees a rendering of two-lane blacktop, a No U- turn sign, a thunderstorm producing a flash flood that engulfs a car, a hitchhiker's thumb, an eagle, the Sierra Nevada, salmon cavorting in the Pacific Ocean, the Pacific Coast Highway from Oregon to Washington, the Rocky Mountains, Montana wheat fields, a South Dakota rattlesnake, Westerberg's house in Carthage, the Colorado River rapids, a canoe beached beside a tent, Las Vegas, and at the buckle end, finally, the letter N.

Ron is sitting on his tailgate, watching Chris, backpack on, climb the stone wall. 
RON Alaska? 
Chris summits. 
RON (CONT'D) Son, what the hell you running from? 
CHRIS (yells down from above) I could ask you the same question. Except I already know the answer. 
RON You do, do you? 
CHRIS I do, Mr. Franz. You've got to get back out in the world. Get out of that lonely house of yours, that little workshop, and go live on the road. 
Ron waves him off. 
CHRIS (CONT'D) Really. You're going to live a long time, Ron. You should make a radical change in your lifestyle. The core of man's spirit comes with new experiences. And there you are, stubborn old man, sitting on your butt. 
RON Sittin' on my butt, huh? 
Ron gets up off the tailgate. 
RON (CONT'D) I'll show you sittin' on my butt. 
And Ron starts making the old man hustle. Shifty shoulders and all, up the stone wall. 
RON (CONT'D) (mumbling) "Stubborn old man." 
Chris is laughing and clapping. 
CHRIS Come on, old man! Come on! 
RON (mumbling) Ya little pinhead. 
Chris is jumping up and down, thrilled for Ron's efforts. Now the old man's shuffle has turned into an old man's walk. But he ain't stopping. And bit by bit he shows he's got it in him after all. 
As Ron is just about to mount the summit, Chris extends a hand. Ron swats it away. 
RON (CONT'D) Ya little pinhead. 
Ron drops down onto his back to catch his breath and let his thumping heart slow down. 
Ron nods. Chris gets out of the truck. Ron watches as Chris saddles up his bag including the duffel that Ron gave him. 
Chris crosses the exit junction to where he can pick up a ride north on the far side of the road. 
We ZOOM SLOWLY through the windshield into Ron's face as he watches Chris hitching away.

CARINE (V.O.) About a month short of the second anniversary of Chris' disappearance, I had gotten engaged to my boyfriend Jerry Ray and was moving in with him... 
Carine, packing her belongings into boxes, stumbles upon the Sharon Olds book Chris had given her on his graduation day. 
CARINE (V.O.) (CONT'D) ...when I stumbled upon the book Chris had given me on his graduation day. For some reason, it was the last line of the poem he read that really stuck out.

Chris is holding a book from which he reads aloud the LAST LINE OF THE POEM... 
CHRIS ...and I will tell about it. 
CARINE (V.O.) I asked Chris who had written the poem. 
What we SEE of Carine plays with the VOICE OVER TRACK and SILENT with the production track; in essence lip synching herself. Chris' dialogue comes directly from the flashback image. 
CARINE (V.O.) (CONT'D) Who wrote that? 
CHRIS Well, it could've been either one of us. Couldn't it? 
We see pictures of Chris on the night-stand of Walt and Billie's bedroom 
CARINE (V.O.) What would he tell about now?   What did his voice sound like now? (MORE) 
CARINE (V.O.) (CONT'D) I realized that the words to my thoughts were of less and less meaning. Chris was writing his story and it had to be Chris who would tell it. 
The pictures in the scene BLUR as - 
CHRIS (O.C.) (in a far away, tunnel-like sound) Mom, help me.

CAMERA ANGLED SKYWARD into the broken rays of grey light. We TILT DOWN to find (and TRACK through the trees with) Chris moving along the river, when he sees something just OFF CAMERA. 
Chris' POV: Through the trees and fireweed, he sees something metallic and rusty. Chris moves up through the underbrush and the snow into the narrow tree line and on into the clearing, where before him: 
A DERELICT SCHOOL BUS. It is a vintage International Harvester from the 1940's. 
Chris approaches the bus, lifts the hood a little bit seeing that the engine is gone. As he moves around the vehicle, we see several windows are cracked or missing altogether. The green and white paint is badly oxidized. Weathered lettering: Fairbanks City Transit System Bus

We follow Chris back out of the bus, surveying the area of the clearing. He loves what he sees. 
CELEBRATORY MUSIC OVER: 
He runs up a berm to look down into the river. 
He runs from corner to corner of this "Magic Bus" area like a new bride surveying her honeymoon suite with glee. 
He climbs a tree, swings from its branch, doing a flip in the air, landing on his feet, but then slipping on the snow and onto his butt and then onto his back. He grabs a handful of snow, shoves it in his mouth, melts it into water, and swallows it. 
CRANE SHOT:   We PULL UP from Chris to high above the clearing.

ANGLE: Chris:   He continues to write as he SPEAKS the words aloud: CHRIS ...the road. Escaped from Atlanta. Thou shalt not return `cause the "west is the best." And now after two rambling years, comes the final and greatest adventure. 
Chris is cleaning up the bus. 
CHRIS (CONT'D) The climactic battle to kill the false being within and victoriously conclude the spiritual revolution. 
Chris shoveling snow away from the bus entrance with a rock. 
CHRIS (CONT'D) Ten days and nights of freight trains and hitchhiking, bringing him to the great white north.

Chris aims carefully and fires six straight shots into the moose's head, dropping it. Chris can hardly believe his own success. He puts the rifle back on his shoulder, just staring at the dead moose. He begins back-pedalling away from it. Bit by bit, his steps turn into a jog and then he turns and runs back toward the bus.

Chris sits amongst the pink bunches of fireweed choking the vehicles wheel wells, growing higher than the axles, his back leaning against the bus, finishing the reading of Family Happiness. 
ANGLE: Chris, reading with great interest.   His POV: The page: what Chris reads: And then, on top of all that, you for a mate, and children, perhaps - what more can the heart of a man desire? 
ANGLE: Chris: He looks up from his book. A gentle breeze tickles morning flowers. The sunlight dances in a coppice of aspen and leaves of trees above. The sound of buzzing flies mutes. He is taking one last look at his paradise.

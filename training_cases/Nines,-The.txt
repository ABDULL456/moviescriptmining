THE NINES 
Written by 
John August 
FINAL SCRIPT 
November 2006 
READER NOTE 
One thing that will be obvious to viewers, but not to readers, is that the nine principal parts in this film are played by only three actors: 
1) Gary, Gavin, Gabriel 
2) Sarah, Susan, Sierra 
3) Margaret, Melissa, Mary 
It'll make more sense in context. Promise. 
A MAN'S HAND 
unwinds a short length of green string. We're extremely close, with a shallow, blurry focus. It's like the first moments after a dream -- just fragments. 
Scissors cut the string. The man wraps it around his left wrist. A loop. A bracelet. 
We see the man's teeth, the edge of his chin as he pulls the knot tight. 
His fingers pull against the string.   Solid.   It won't break easily. 
FADE OUT. 
PITCH BLACK 
There's no music. No sound at all, really, except for some distant birds CHIRPING. 
Then a SQUEAK.   A SQUEAL as rusty springs engage. 
A GARAGE DOOR LIFTS, 
revealing GARY BANKS in silhouette. He's 30, effortlessly fit, with movie-star good looks. (Although for now, he's merely a TV star.) 
Like most Laurel Canyon garages, this one has never held a car. Instead, it's the resting place for all the detritus of bachelordom: shitty Ikea furniture, a drum set, a styrofoam snowman, and the Harley he always meant to get running. 
Gary spots what he was looking for. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. BACK PATIO / LAUREL CANYON HOUSE - MAGIC HOUR (DAWN) 
Gary drags a beaten Weber kettle. One of its wheels is broken, SCRAPING against the deck. 
WIDER, we see Gary's house has an incredible view of the city. He couldn't fucking care less. 
He yanks the circular grill out of the Weber and throws it down the canyon. 
He empties a garbage bag into the barbecue: mostly women's clothes, but also some stuffed animals and photos still in their frames. There's too much to fit, so he tries stomping it down with a flip-flopped foot. 
He cracks open a container of lighter fluid and begins drenching everything inside. He sprays until the container is WHEEZING air. He shakes it, making sure it's really empty. 
Then he cracks open a new container and keeps spraying.   And spraying. 
We follow the dripping fluid as it runs across a photo of Gary and a BLONDE WOMAN. Her eyes are scratched out, making her unrecognizable. 
Under the grill, lighter fluid is dripping in a stream, soaking into the wooden deck. 
Finally satisfied, Gary throws the lighter fluid aside. He takes five steps back and pulls a box of matches from his pocket. 
EXTREMELY CLOSE as the match SCRAPES, erupting in flames. 
On Gary's left wrist, we see a green string bracelet. 
MUSIC STARTS: a pounding, hypnotic track that will carry us through these MAIN TITLES. 
In EPIC SLOW-MOTION, we follow the burning match as it sails through the air, tumbling end-over-end. 
Just as it's about to reach its target, we... 
GARY I don't do heroin. 
MARGARET Yeah, crack is classy. And I'm not buying you porn. There's spray-per- view on cable. 
GARY Good. I really wasn't concerned about my career, my family or my future. I just wanted to jack off. 
Margaret is a little impressed by this show of backbone. 
MARGARET Let me see your phone. 
He hands over his cell phone.   She drops it in the contraband box. 
GARY C'mon!   All my numbers are in that. 
MARGARET Dial ten digits at random. Whoever answers will be better than the people on this phone. 
She picks up the liquor box, ready to go. 
MARGARET (CONT'D) You have my cell number. You have delivery menus. You're fine. Right? 
GARY I guess. 
As she leaves, Margaret notices a long butane lighter by the stove. She adds it to the box, just to be sure. 
TIME CUT TO: 
INT. HOUSE / VARIOUS - DAY 
Gary paces around his new home, trying to get a feel for it. 
He plays a few NOTES on the piano. 
He looks up at the painting over the staircase:    a cliff near the ocean. 
He opens random drawers in a Chinese herb cabinet, wondering if there's anything hidden in one of the 46 slots. There isn't. 
He takes a long beat to consider three paintings in the dining room, which show the same thing in three different ways. 
EXT. BACKYARD - SUMMER NIGHT 
Gary swims laps, trying to exhaust himself. 
He stands in the shallow end, listening to the quiet. 
INT. KITCHEN - SUMMER NIGHT 
Wearing a fluffy white robe, he looks through the delivery menus. 
INT. FOYER / FRONT DOOR - SUMMER NIGHT 
He takes a bag of food from a college-age DELIVERY GUY, who seems to recognize him. Gary pays him, shuts the door. 
As he's walking to the kitchen with the food, Gary looks back and sees the Delivery Guy watching him from the front walk. The guy is a little embarrassed, but Gary is pretty used to being stared at. 
INT. KITCHEN - SUMMER NIGHT 
Gary unwraps the Thai food.   Makes himself a plate. 
He watches CRIME LAB on the plasma screen while eating dinner. 
GARY (O.S. TV DIALOGUE) Once we get these samples back to the Crime Lab, we'll know who the real killer is. 
INT. LIBRARY / TV ROOM - NIGHT 
Gary scans the shelves, looking for something to read. There are five times more books here than Gary has opened in his lifetime. 
He settles on a paperback of Voltaire's Candide. 
He lies back on the couch, reading it. 
He flips a few pages ahead to see if it gets more interesting. A beat. 
CUT TO: 
GARY JACKING OFF 
to soft-core pay-per-view. We're CLOSE ON Gary's straining face, but we can hear the pleasured MOANS of the actresses as they go down on each other. 
Nearing climax, he looks for something to come on.     He can't find anything. 
(A practiced ear notices a Canadian accent.) 
WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D) Over here. To your left. (correcting) Right. Sorry. Right. 
He follows the voice to a gap in the hedges at the far corner of the yard, finding SARAH GLEASON. Late 30's, fresh- scrubbed and girlish, she looks more fragile than she really is. 
SARAH I'm working on my putting, if you can believe it. 
Indeed, she's holding a putter. 
GARY Not really. 
SARAH Okay. Maybe I was just looking for a way to meet my infamous neighbor. You see, I'm under house arrest, too. 
GARY What did you do? 
SARAH I had sex with my husband. 
GARY That's awful. 
SARAH Nine months later, I had Jaden. That's her over there. 
She points to a small portable baby monitor. 
GARY She's cute. 
SARAH She's sleeping for another... (checks watch) ...seventeen minutes. She keeps to a schedule. 
GARY She sounds really boring. 
SARAH (whispers) She is. 
A beat.   A smile between them. 
GARY You're rich. Shouldn't you have a nanny from Ecuador? 
SARAH I'm Canadian. 
GARY (as if that explains it) Ohhh... 
SARAH I can't work in the U.S. Plus, I want to maintain this air of moral superiority by doing everything myself. 
GARY Very Canadian. 
SARAH Thanks. 
Another pregnant pause. 
SARAH (CONT'D) Listen, Jaden goes down again at 2:30. Maybe I could stop by. 
GARY I'm pretty sure I'll be here. 
SARAH It's a date. 
GARY Is it? 
She picks up the baby monitor, heading back into her house. Suddenly, she realizes... 
SARAH Oh.   I'm Sarah, by the way. 
GARY Gary. 
SARAH Yeah.    I know. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BATHROOM - DAY 
Gary brushes his teeth and tongue. 
OMIT 
INT. KITCHEN - DAY 
Gary neatens up, tossing out newspapers and delivery boxes. He plumps pillows. 
He looks up at the clock:      2:30. 
He sits, trying to read Candide again.     He fidgets. 
MARGARET ...I was born at the wrong time. 
GARY Exactly. 
We REVERSE to see the object of their awe: a giant inflatable jump-o-rama in the shape of a castle. 
CUT TO: 
INT. THE CASTLE - DAY 
VARIOUS SHOTS: Gary and Margaret jump with all their might, bouncing off the walls, SCREAMING all the time. 
When both finally collapse, it becomes strangely tranquil. They're safe inside an inflatable paradise. 
Gary scoots over beside Margaret.     She puts her head on his arms. It's nice. 
Prelap:   A doorbell RINGS. 
CUT TO: 
INT.   FOYER - DAY 
Gary opens the door to find Sarah. 
SARAH Where's the warden? 
GARY Groceries. 
SARAH Quite the little missus. 
She walks past him, into the house. 
INT.   LIVING ROOM - DAY [CONTINUOUS] 
Sarah crosses to the couch, picking up the baby monitor. 
GARY How's Jaden? 
SARAH Boring. We haven't had nearly the grand old time you two have been having. 
There's an edge to her voice. 
GARY You've been watching. 
SARAH Well. I don't want to meddle in your affairs. 
GARY My affairs? 
SARAH Everyone needs affection.    I get it. 
She's headed back for the door. 
GARY I don't.    Are you seriously jealous? 
SARAH The opposite. I just want to protect her. 
GARY From what? 
SARAH From you. Look at you. You date models. Actresses. Tennis players. 
GARY Yeah. 
SARAH On a scale of one to ten, you belong with the Nines. We both know you won't settle for less. 
With that, she's gone. 
CUT TO: 
INT. KITCHEN - DAY 
Gary is trying to load dishes into the dishwasher, but has a hard time getting one bowl to fit. 
MARGARET What are "the Nines?" 
GARY What? 
He looks over.    Margaret holds up the orange sticky note by the phone. 
MARGARET "Look for the Nines." 
INT.   UPSTAIRS WALKWAY - NIGHT 
Margaret leans out her doorway: 
MARGARET Goodnight, ratface. 
GARY Goodnight. 
INT.   BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Gary sits in one of the upholstered chairs, staring at his still-made bed. It's impossible to know what he's thinking, but the wheels are turning. 
EXT. SIDE PATIO - MORNING 
Gary opens the newspaper to a page at random.   He starts circling things with a red Sharpie. 
MACRO CLOSE UP.    His pen circles the number nine every time it appears. 
As he flips the page, he spots Sarah looking in through the rounded trellis, just a few feet away. She's holding her own newspaper, still in the wrapper. 
SARAH Hey neighbor. 
GARY Hi. 
SARAH Sorry for the psychotic episode. I'll blame it on hormones. 
GARY Okay. 
SARAH Are you alright? You look a little Beautiful Mind-ish. 
He almost deflects it, but decides to trust her: 
GARY How many times should the number nine come up? Probablistically? 
SARAH Probablistically? 
GARY (annoyed) You know what I mean. 
SARAH One time out of ten. 
GARY How about every time? 
He hands her the paper through the bars. 
GARY (CONT'D) But they only show up when you look for them. Looking for them changes things. 
Trying to find an explanation... 
SARAH Some of these are prices. There's going to be a lot of nines when... 
GARY There is something wrong with the world. 
Sarah looks up slowly. She smiles for an uncomfortably long beat. She's stalling, thinking. 
SARAH You have an eyelash on your... here... 
She steps forward, and motions for him to lean closer to the bars. Brushing off the non-existent eyelash, she WHISPERS: 
SARAH (CONT'D) I can get you out of here.    But you have to trust me. 
MARGARET [O.S.] Morning. 
MARGARET 
enters, carrying her tea. She sees Gary by himself, leaning near the bars of the trellis. 
MARGARET Everything okay? 
GARY Peachy. 
MARGARET Peachy's good. I like peaches. 
WIDER, 
we see that Sarah is flush back against the wall, out of Margaret's line of sight. 
MARGARET (CONT'D) You want coffee? 
GARY Sure. 
She sits forward in her chair.    By instinct, he sits back. 
MARGARET Everything is what it is. But you're not who you think you are. 
NEW ANGLE (TIME JUMP) 
Gary gets up, headed for the front door. 
MARGARET (CONT'D) God, no!   Please, Gary, don't. 
But he's already outside. 
EXT.   FRONT WALKWAY - DAY 
He's walking towards the blue chalk perimeter line, headed for Sarah's house. 
Leaves fall lazily from the trees, counter-point to the tension. 
Margaret calls out from the arched windows. 
MARGARET You don't know what you're doing. 
She's almost at tears.   He stops at the edge of the chalk line. 
GARY What happens if I cross this line? 
The tear in her eye falls. 
MARGARET I don't know. But it's not good. 
He very deliberately steps over the line. We hear a thin BEEPING from the house-arrest anklet. He shoots her a look to say, is that all there is? 
But the BEEPING grows louder, deeper. It starts to come from all sides, booming, a nuclear-meltdown/self-destruct-sequence- activated DRONE. 
Gary suddenly realizes something very, very terrible is about to happen. 
GARY Oh shit. 
The world ignites in white-hot atomic flames. 
We see the blinding glare erupt behind Margaret, illuminating through her skin, right to the bone. 
The same flash catches a leaf in mid-air, sizzling through it like an etched x-ray. 
As the light hits Gary, we... 
CUT TO BLACK. 
READER NOTE: Part 2 is a half-hour episode of a Project Greenlight-style documentary series called "Behind the Screen," which tracks the progress of a one-hour TV drama pilot from conception through delivery. In keeping with the genre, it's very fast and cutty. 
INTERVIEW sequences are done to an off- camera interviewer. 
Some scenes are unscripted. The gist of these scenes is summarized in italics. 
TITLES OVER: 
Part Two: REALITY TELEVISION 
CUT TO: 
ANIMATED TITLES 
We RUSH IN on a television set, which spins around revealing a blinding constellation of pixels. 
MELISSA (V.O.) Previously, on "Behind the Screen." 
CUT TO: 
EXT. STUDIO LOT - DAY 
GAVIN TAYLOR (30) walks to a meeting, with his laptop bag over his shoulder. He has a tidy, Banana Republic sensibility and an easy smile that belies his manic schedule. 
SUSAN (V.O.) Gavin Taylor's one of the best TV writers out there. 
INT. SUSAN'S OFFICE - DAY 
Cluttered and corporate, with stacks of scripts and a few touches of arbitrary quirk. SUSAN HOWARD (35) and Gavin kiss hello. 
SUSAN (V.O.) Every network would kill to work with him. 
A DRIVER holds up a sign for "TAYLOR." Gavin approaches, waves to him. He has a laptop bag over his shoulder. 
TITLES identify him as: 
Gavin Taylor Creator / Showrunner 
INT.   LAUNDRY ROOM / KITCHEN - DAY 
Gavin unlocks the door, entering from the driveway. He's hauling a massive wheeled duffle bag. (Note: This is the same house from Part One.) 
We hear the CLATTER of toenails on hardwood floors.   Gavin kneels down to greet... 
GAVIN Puggies! 
Gavin's PUGS pounce all over him. 
INT.   KITCHEN - DAY [MINUTES LATER] 
Gavin is on the cordless phone, talking with a friend as he sorts through massive piles of mail. 
On his left wrist, we notice the same green string bracelet Gary wore in Part One. 
GAVIN (ON PHONE) It's weird being back. It doesn't feel like my house anymore. 
A220                                                                 A220 INT.   FOYER - DAY 
Gavin sits at the piano, pecking out a haunting melody he's been fiddling with. He grabs a red diskette and a Sharpie. 
GAVIN (V.O.) At this stage, you have the script you wrote, and the film you shot, but you don't know how it's all going to come together. You just know how you want it to feel. 
He writes "Knowing" on the diskette, and pops it into the Disclavier unit. 
INT. EDITING SUITE - DAY 
Susan, Gavin and the EDITOR watch the cut.   Susan is taking notes on a legal pad. 
JUMP CUT TO: 
Susan flips to her next note.   TITLES list her position as: 
Susan Howard VP, Drama Development 
SUSAN I just don't know if you need the cold open. People want to get right to the story. 
ANGLE ON the Editor, bristling a bit. 
INT. HALLWAY - DAY [LATER] 
Impromptu INTERVIEW. 
GAVIN I invited Susan to see a rough cut because I trust her taste. 
INTERCUT editing suite. 
SUSAN Could we be more clear why Mary is so freaked out at that moment? 
GAVIN Wow. I thought it was pretty obvious. And dramatic. 
GAVIN [INTERVIEW] More importantly, I trust her as a barometer of Roger's taste. 
SUSAN I know. But that's Roger's big thing this season. Never let the audience be confused. 
CUT TO: 
INT. EDITING SUITE - [LATER THAT] DAY 
The Editor hands Melissa a microphone.    TITLES list her simply as: 
Melissa McCarthy "Mary" 
GAVIN So we're trying to squeeze in a wild line over this shot of Noelle. 
The monitor shows a three-second clip. It's Melissa and a eight year-old actress ("Noelle") in a car. 
Melissa's character looks alarmed by something the girl has just done or said. 
MELISSA What's the line? 
GAVIN (quickly) How could you... 
GAVIN The guy was crazy. Obviously. The show is kinda twisted, and it just flipped something in him. 
Gavin sounds like he's trying to convince himself. 
PRODUCER'S VOICE (O.C.) What did he say? 
GAVIN Oblivio accebit. It's Latin. "Oblivion approaches." 
PRODUCER'S VOICE (O.C.) What do you think it means? 
GAVIN Other than the world is coming to an end? "Oblivio" also means forgetting, forgetfulness. (jump cut) I think that's what I'm going to do. Forget it. 
CUT TO: 
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Gavin hosts a game night: good friends and lots of cocktails. The guests include Melissa and Susan, along with SAM, TOM, BRUCE, DANA, JON, KEVIN, JEFF, DAN, and CARL. (We don't show anyone's names.) 
They're playing Celebrity. We go several rounds, keeping the best of what's said. 
CUT TO: 
INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT 
Between rounds of Celebrity, party-goers mingle. Gavin is making a new batch of cocktails -- he obviously has a knack for it. 
Susan pours herself another glass of chardonnay. 
SUSAN Did you have a chance to look at the cards yet? 
GAVIN From the screening? 
Melissa reaches in, grabbing the vodka. 
MELISSA Pardon me.      Daddy needs his drink. 
She makes a quick Cape Cod.            From the other room, Sam YELLS: 
SAM (O.S.) Woman, where's my cocktail! 
MELISSA (yelling back) I'm a-comin! (to Gavin) I still love you most. 
She gives him a quick peck, then dashes off with Sam's drink. 
SUSAN (continuing her thought) People write stuff on the cards they won't say in a focus group. They get more specific. 
He SHAKES the mixer. 
SUSAN (CONT'D) Roger has this advice I always remember. (MORE) 
SUSAN (CONT'D) Forget about anyone who scores you in the Twos and Threes. They'll never like your show. 
Gavin pours. 
SUSAN (CONT'D) Instead, look for the Nines. 
GAVIN The Nines. 
SUSAN They're the one who think your show is almost the best thing they've ever seen. They get your vision. They just want it to be even better. 
Melissa YELLS from the living room: 
MELISSA Round two is starting without you! 
SUSAN So you'll look at the cards? 
GAVIN Absolutely. 
Making his way back to the living room, he stops by the phone. Pulls out an orange Post-It and makes a note. 
As he leaves, we go in CLOSE to read it: 
LOOK FOR THE NINES 
CUT TO: 
INT. SUSAN'S OFFICE - DAY 
INTERVIEW. 
INT. SUSINA - DAY [LATER] 
Dahlia is gone.           INTERVIEW with Gavin. 
GAVIN I see why the network loves her. It's just, I wrote the part for Melissa. She's one of my best friends. And in my head, I only see Melissa for the role. (jump cut) Could Dahlia do it? Absolutely. It could work. I just don't know if I want it to work. 
OMIT 
INT. PC BANG - NIGHT 
A empty storefront in Koreatown, both walls lined with computers for the CUSTOMERS playing high-end videogames.                                 We see Gavin playing. 
His INTERVIEW is intercut with his intense focus on the screen as he plays "Bad Day L.A." 
GAVIN When I get stressed out, I play videogames. It's my therapy. I can't have them on my own computer, because then I'd never write. So I come down to Koreatown. (jump cut) (MORE) 
GAVIN (CONT'D) Videogames are better than real life. When you get stuck, you can always hit `reset.' Life needs a reset button. 
INT. KITCHEN - DAY 
Gavin's on the phone. 
GAVIN If we're really going to replace Melissa, I want to hear it from Roger. 
INT. SUSAN'S OFFICE - DAY 
Susan talks to the speakerphone. 
INTERCUT GAVIN 
SUSAN Roger's on a flight to London. But I talked with him before he left. He said yes on Dahlia. 
GAVIN What does that mean? 
SUSAN It means yes. 
GAVIN Yes, replace Melissa? 
SUSAN He wants your show on the air, starring Dahlia. I just got off the phone with her agents. They love it. She loves you. 
GAVIN What about Melissa? 
SUSAN You want me to call her agents? 
GAVIN God no.    I'll tell her. 
Gavin hangs up.   We stay on his side of the conversation. 
In the background, we see the door to the driveway swing open by itself. 
A beat later, it SLAMS shut. 
Gavin is understandably startled. 
CUT TO: 
OMIT 
INT. REHEARSAL STUDIO - DAY 
Melissa, wearing a nun's habit, sings "As Long As He Needs Me." A PIANIST is rehearsing with her. 
MELISSA As long as he needs me, I know where I must be... 
INTERCUT with on-camera INTERVIEW: 
MELISSA (CONT'D) In-between the pilot and the series, I'm trying to squeeze in a one-woman show. (edit) I've always been obsessed with nuns. They're sort of like God's fag-hags. 
Melissa spots Gavin entering and sings the rest of the song to him. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. WEST HOLLYWOOD BAR - NIGHT 
Gavin and Melissa have martinis. 
GAVIN I think my house is haunted. 
MELISSA Your house is really old. 
GAVIN Sort of like, "Here's our new shit. Like it?" (edit) Upfronts is a complete oxymoron, because no one is remotely honest. 
INTERCUT SUSAN: 
SUSAN The schedule is a secret until it's announced, so everything is still in play. 
JUMP CUT: 
GAVIN But hey!   At least you're in New York! 
CUT TO: 
INT. TOWNCAR / NEW YORK / DRIVING - DAY 
Gavin watches Manhattan roll by out the windows. 
EXT. MANHATTAN HOTEL - DAY 
Gavin tips the DRIVER and wheels his luggage into a skyscraper hotel. 
INT. MANHATTAN HOTEL HALLWAY - DAY 
Gavin opens the door to room 1909. 
INT. MANHATTAN HOTEL ROOM - DAY 
Gavin checks out the view.     We go CLOSE ON a card which reads: 
Congrats! Love Roger, Susan, and everyone at the network 
It came with a fruit tray. 
INT. MANHATTAN HOTEL ELEVATOR - DAY 
Gavin, alone, is headed down to the lobby.      Impromptu INTERVIEW continues: 
GAVIN It's surreal being here. None of this is how I planned it. 
The elevator stops at another floor. CAMERA doesn't look as the doors open, but Gavin spots someone he knows. 
GAVIN (CONT'D) Hey you! 
WOMAN'S VOICE God.    Hi.    Gavin. 
TURN to find Dahlia Salem.     She's hesitant to get on the elevator. 
DAHLIA You're doing your...show. 
She means the camera filming them. 
GAVIN Get on. Come join reality television. 
She steps on.    Hits the button for "Lobby." 
GAVIN (CONT'D) When did you get in? 
DAHLIA Just now. This whole last 24 hours has been surreal. 
GAVIN I just said surreal. 
DAHLIA You're good? I wanted to call you. 
GAVIN Please.   Call anytime.   I don't sleep. 
DAHLIA I just felt weird about what happened. 
Not sure he's following... 
GAVIN Did something happen? 
CUT TO: 
EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - DAY 
Near the hotel, Gavin is on his cell phone. 
GAVIN So I just bumped into Dahlia Salem, star of my show... 
TITLES indicate Gavin's on the phone with his agents. 
SUSAN (CONT'D) You think I deliberately sabotaged your show. 
GAVIN Didn't you? 
SUSAN G., I'm on your side. Trust me, I'm the only one who is trying to protect you. 
GAVIN                           SUSAN Protect me from what?   You?    There is so much more going You are psychotic.              on than you... 
GAVIN All I want to know is why. 
SUSAN You want a motive? 
GAVIN Yes. 
SUSAN This isn't "Crime Lab."   No one got murdered. 
GAVIN My show did. So tell me why. 
SUSAN I had to get you away from her. She was holding you back. 
GAVIN Melissa. 
SUSAN You had to give her up. (beat) C'mon, G. If she really mattered, you couldn't have betrayed her so easily. 
GAVIN I didn't. 
SUSAN What, you're the victim? The big Creator can't stand up to one little d-girl? It was your choice. I didn't make you do anything. I mean, do you have any principles? Do you believe in anything but your own ego? 
GAVIN Fuck you. 
SUSAN Your dialogue used to be sharper. Maybe Gatins could do a polish. 
He suddenly punches her, one hit to the face.   She drops hard. 
Gavin takes a step back. 
Tasting blood, Susan gets to her knees.   A wry smile. 
SUSAN (CONT'D) Is that all there is? 
In the background, we see partygoers responding to the blow. Susan gets to her feet. She approaches Gavin, hands open. She's not going to hit him. 
SUSAN (CONT'D) Do you feel like a man? Because I'll tell you a secret. 
She leans in very close to his ear.   There's a strange intimacy between them. 
SUSAN (CONT'D) (whisper) You're not. 
She walks away.   CLOSE ON Gavin. 
EXT. MANHATTAN SIDEWALK - DAY 
We move with Gavin as he walks. He's trying to get away from the camera, but it keeps following him. 
He reaches a crosswalk. He has to wait for the light. Finally, he looks INTO CAMERA: 
GAVIN Look, I don't want to do this anymore. My show's not going to happen, so this show is over. (MORE) 
GAVIN (CONT'D) Done. Gone. I`m not going to be your fucking puppet. 
OFF-SCREEN VOICE Are you alright? 
Gavin looks left, where an African-American woman is waiting for the same crosswalk. (We recognize her as Octavia, the streetwalker from Part One.) 
GAVIN I'm fine. 
OCTAVIA Who were you talking to? 
Gavin looks back towards camera, a strange expression. 
MUCH WIDER 
We see Gavin and the woman on the corner. There's no camera Gavin could have been talking to. He's understandably perplexed: Where did the documentary crew go? 
Was there ever anyone there? 
Our CAMERA style has changed:    instead of handheld and jerky, we're smooth and slow. 
The MUSIC has completely changed, underscoring a sense of creeping dread. 
She didn't mean to get on that tangent... 
MARGARET (CONT'D) What's important is that you, you're the big cheese. El Supremo. You could destroy the world with a single thought. (suddenly) Don't, incidentally. Just file that away. But the truth is, you hold all the cards: every church, every candle, every sacrifice -- that's for you. When people pray, they're not praying because they want this thing or that thing. They just don't want to be forgotten. 
MARGARET (CONT'D) So you understand, I would have told you earlier, but I didn't... 
GARY Yeah. 
MARGARET Okay. 
GARY I understand. But I don't believe you. 
He gets up to exit. (This is where we jump-cut time earlier.) 
FREEZE FRAME. 
FADE TO BLACK. 
TITLE OVER BLACK: 
Part Three: KNOWING 
FADE IN: 
EXT. MEADOW - DAY 
In a WIDE SHOT, we see a vast field, bordered by green mountains. Unseen BIRDS call out from the trees, while insects CLICK and WHIRR. 
In the distance, we spot swatches of bright colors moving our way. It's a family: father GABRIEL (34), wife MARY (33) and daughter NOELLE (8). They're returning from a short day hike. Mary carries a small videocamera. 
Seeing that Noelle is already a ways down the path... 
GABRIEL Noelle!   Don't get too far ahead. 
Noelle turns around. Instead of speaking, she moves her hands in sign language. (She's mute, not deaf.) 
MARY No.   You had ice cream at lunch. 
Noelle begs to differ.   More signing. 
GABRIEL (to Mary) Apparently frozen yogurt doesn't count. 
MARY I'll make note. 
EXT. SMALL GRAVEL ROAD - DAY 
The family walks up to their car, a blue Toyota Prius. Gabriel sheds his daypack, trying to open the hatchback.    It won't lift. 
Mary goes to open the passenger door.      Locked. 
MARY Did you hit it? 
GABRIEL Shouldn't have to. 
He fishes the keys out of his pocket.     Presses the remote entry button repeatedly. 
Gabriel tries to open the driver's side door.      Locked.   Even Noelle knows something's wrong. 
Gabriel pulls the small mechanical key out of the fob. Unlocks the door and climbs in. Opens the door for Mary and Noelle. 
GABRIEL (CONT'D) I think we left the overhead light on. 
He taps it.   Moves the switch. 
MARY Shit. 
Noelle signs her made-up representation of "shit." 
MARY (CONT'D) Noelle. 
Gabriel slides the key into the slot.     Hits "START." Nothing. 
GABRIEL Battery is dead. Least the starter is. 
Noelle leans forward, aware that this is something serious. 
MARY How do we...? 
GABRIEL We call the service.     That's all we can do. 
In VARIOUS SHOTS, we get a sense of the distance he's travelling. He passes gulches, meadows and boulder fields. 
He finally arrives at the junction of the dirt road and a larger... 
EXT. PAVED ROAD - DAY [CONTINUOUS] 
Pulling out Mary's cell phone, Gabriel tries to get a signal. By his reaction, it's still iffy. 
He dials, but the call drops.    Tries again.   Just the same. 
He looks left.   Looks right.    Looks back down the dirt road. 
He decides to head off to the right, downhill. 
EXT. FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD - DAY 
We catch up to Gabriel as he's walking in the middle of the road, still trying unsuccessfully to get a signal. 
In the distance, he spots a patch of moving color: a female hiker. A moment's hesitation, then he YELLS out to her: 
GABRIEL Excuse me!     Hi! Hello? 
She stops, turns. 
Gabriel jogs to close the distance. As we approach, we reveal SIERRA, 38. In the past 10 years, she's "made a fresh start" 12 times. In this incarnation, she's a wilderness- loving, Bush-hating, wildly-overeducated clerk at Trader Joe's in Venice. 
GABRIEL (CONT'D) Excuse me.     Do you have a cell phone? 
SIERRA No, I don't. There's no service up here. 
GABRIEL (re: his phone) Yeah, I'm finding that out. 
SIERRA You can usually get a signal up at the ranger station. 
GABRIEL Okay... 
She points in the opposite direction -- back the way he came. 
SIERRA You follow the road. It's probably... I don't know. You have a car? 
GABRIEL It's dead.     That's why I need... 
SIERRA Oh... 
She pulls a stray hair back from her mouth.       Notices him noticing her. 
GABRIEL Yeah. 
A beat.   She takes a subtle step closer to the center of the road. 
GABRIEL (CONT'D) Are you headed back to your car now? If you could give me a ride to a gas station, wherever... 
She doesn't leap to extend an invitation.        It takes a beat for Gabriel to figure out why. 
GABRIEL (CONT'D) Oh. Hey. Look, I'm not some crazy Ted Bundy guy. I'm not going to rape you or kill you or anything. 
She doesn't seem reassured. 
GABRIEL (CONT'D) Of course, that's what Ted Bundy would say. Look, I'm a videogame designer. (fishing through wallet) My wife is an editor. My daughter is four. 
He offers her a family photo.     She looks at it, but doesn't take it. 
GABRIEL (CONT'D) They're waiting back at the car, and I want to get some help before it gets dark. 
SIERRA I can call somebody when I get to town. 
Trying to temper his frustration... 
GABRIEL I believe you. I do. But you don't know where the car is. And the guy might not come. We can't be up here all night. 
Sierra backs away. 
SIERRA I'm sorry. 
GABRIEL Don't be sorry. Just help me out here. 
SIERRA No.   I can't. I'm sorry. 
Once she feels she's reached a good distance, she turns and keeps walking. 
Gabriel walks with Sierra. The trees here are taller, creating a cathedral-like ceiling above them. 
SIERRA Okay, confession.    I kind of recognized you. 
GABRIEL Really? 
SIERRA I wasn't sure, but I think I saw a picture of you in some videogame magazine my boyfriend had. You're, like, the shit. 
GABRIEL No. 
SIERRA You're like the Quentin Tarantino of that world. A videogame God. 
GABRIEL Not really. 
SIERRA Fine. 
GABRIEL You seriously recognized me off of one photo? 
SIERRA I thought you were kinda hot. Considering. 
GABRIEL Considering..? 
SIERRA Within the subset of videogame people. 
GABRIEL Okay. 
SIERRA I wasn't masturbating to your picture or anything. 
GABRIEL Well, I guess I'm flattered. 
SIERRA You should be. I'm stingy with compliments. 
GABRIEL So your boyfriend plays videogames? 
SIERRA Ex-boyfriend. And yes. Way too many. He used to play Evercrack back in the day, but yours, well, that was like...what's worse than crack? 
GABRIEL Super-crack? 
SIERRA Sure.   He was this orc witch doctor guy. 
GABRIEL Shaman? 
SIERRA Yeah. At one point he was spending like, 40 hours a week gathering "thunderleaf" or whatever. (MORE) 
SIERRA (CONT'D) Then I was his mule, hauling it around because he ran out of space. 
GABRIEL You had an account? 
SIERRA I was part of your world, and you didn't even know it. 
GABRIEL Sorry. 
SIERRA You can make it up to me. 
EXT. ROAD NEAR PRIUS - DAY 
Mary is pacing -- but trying not to look like she's pacing. She holds the other cell phone (Gabriel's), which she turns on and off, hoping that somehow she'll get a signal. 
Each time she turns it on, we hear the CHIMES. 
IN THE PRIUS 
Noelle is still playing with the video camera, watching footage of the hike. She decides to wind back further. 
CLOSE ON the blocky pixels rushing past. 
Noelle hits "play."   For now, we just hear the audio. 
MAN'S VOICE ...I have five seasons mapped out, and though it sucks, either you go away, or the show goes. I had to make a decision, and that's the decision I made. I'm sorry. 
We reveal the screen. We're watching the argument between Gavin and Melissa from Part 2. 
MELISSA (ON TAPE) So it's done. Finished. Decided. 
GAVIN (ON TAPE) Yeah. 
Confused, Noelle looks out at her mother, Mary, who is still pacing with the cell phone. 
MELISSA (ON TAPE) I understand. 
Noelle doesn't look up. 
MARY (CONT'D) I was thinking we could all go to El Cholo for dinner. How would you feel about some blue corn enchiladas? Should we ask Daddy when he gets back? 
Without looking up... 
NOELLE He's not coming back. 
Mary is stunned. For her part, Noelle seems to have no idea she just spoke her first words. 
We hear three evenly-spaced BEEPS.    After the third one, Mary says: 
MARY How could you... 
Mary flinches.    It's like someone walked over her grave. 
Noelle hands her the camera. The footage is cued to earlier in Part 2, where Gavin is having Melissa loop in a wild line: 
MELISSA (ON TAPE) Howkajew. How could you. How could you. (MORE) 
MELISSA (ON TAPE) (CONT'D) (beat) I feel so dirty. 
GAVIN (ON TAPE) That's how I like ya. 
Mary backs out of the car, as if trying to get away from the video camera. But she's still holding it. 
She hits STOP.   Tries to collect herself. 
Noelle gets out of the car, but doesn't approach.      She signs, "Mommy?" 
Mary backs away. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.   FOREST VALE - DAY 
Gabriel and Sierra stop for a moment, so he can pull off his outer shirt. For the first time, we see that Gabriel has a large tattoo on his back which looks like this: 
IX He's sweating a lot. 
GABRIEL Am I crazy, or is it getting hotter? 
SIERRA Oh, you're crazy. 
She hands him back the water bottle.   He gladly drinks. 
When she takes the bottle back, she steps forward. The motion leaves them face-to-face. She pauses for a moment, just long enough for him to turn away. 
He doesn't. 
She kisses him. He doesn't really kiss back -- but he doesn't fight it, either. 
She puts a hand on his thigh, sliding up the inside.     Only when she reaches his crotch does he pull back. 
GABRIEL I have a wife. And a daughter. They're waiting for me. 
SIERRA Where are they? 
GABRIEL Back at the car. 
SIERRA I mean, which direction? 
GABRIEL They're back... 
Gabriel turns, trying to get his bearing.      The trees BLUR. He nearly falls over. 
He manages to steady himself. 
SIERRA Face it, G.: You don't know where they are. You don't know where you are. We've been walking in circles for an hour. 
GABRIEL Where's your car? 
SIERRA There is no car. That was all a... (what's the word) "pretense," I guess. An excuse to get you alone. 
Wobbling, Gabriel sits down on a stump.   Sierra kneels down in front of him. 
SIERRA (CONT'D) Dizzy, huh? It's probably just the GHB. In the water. 
She holds up the water bottle. 
AGITATED MAN You forgot this wasn't real. 
INT./EXT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS - DAY 
S. We couldn't just storm in on a fiery chariot. It's your universe. We had to play by your rules. We had to make you see how limited and corrupt your little world was. Don't get me wrong, this world is nice. It's cozy. But do you remember where you came from? 
A few beats while it comes back to him. Tears start to build in his eyes. What he's picturing is unspeakably beautiful. 
G. It was warm. And white.    Like...

Octavia leans over Gary, who has fallen off the bed.

EXT.   GRAVEL ROAD / NEAR THE PRIUS - DAY 
Mary is sitting on the road. Noelle has her chin on her mother's shoulder, watching the videotape with her. 
ON SCREEN, with tinny audio: (from scene 177) 
MARGARET You could destroy the world with a single thought. (suddenly) Don't, incidentally. Just file that away. But the truth is, you hold all the cards: every church, every candle, every sacrifice -- that's for you. When people pray, they're not praying because they want this thing or that thing. They just don't want to be forgotten. 
BACK TO: 
A317                                                                 A317 EXT.   ROAD / PRIUS - DAY 
Mary is still watching the tape. She realizes Noelle isn't watching over her shoulder anymore. 
Mary looks around.    Her daughter is nowhere to be seen. 
MARY Noelle?    Noelle! 
CUT TO: 
EXT.   FOREST CROSSROADS - DAY 
Gabriel and Sierra are back at the junction where the paved road meets the gravel road. 
GABRIEL Maybe if I just cut back, didn't get so involved... 
SIERRA We both know that'll never work. Next week, you'll be back here redesigning the pinecones. You have to quit cold-turkey. 
GABRIEL I can't. 
SIERRA You can. But I can't force you to leave. You have to want it. 
She takes his hand, running a finger through the green string bracelet around his wrist. 
She kisses him.   And then she's gone. 
Gabriel stands there for a long beat, considering his decision. 
x103                                                                x103 OMIT 
EXT.   GRAVEL ROAD / NEAR THE PRIUS - DAY 
Panicking, Mary calls out for -- 
MARY Noelle!   Noelle! 
She's nowhere to be found.     Then, from behind her... 
GABRIEL She's here. 
Gabriel is walking up the gravel road, with Noelle holding his hand. 
GABRIEL Worst-case scenario? Spontaneous disintegration into a fiery void. Oblivio accebit. The end of everything. 
MARY That's all? 
Both smile. 
GABRIEL That probably wouldn't happen. The basic structure of the universe should hold. I guess I'm just worried about the human factor. You guys kill each other a lot. 
MARY In fairness, that's usually in your name. Plus we've gotten much more efficient at it. 
A beat. 
GABRIEL I like this world. I like my life, here, with you and Noelle... 
MARY But it's not real. I'm not really your wife, you're not really my husband. On some level, it's all pretend. 
GABRIEL It's not pretend. There's a reason you were there, in every version. You were my sister, my wife, my best friend... 
MARY That's a little creepy. 
GABRIEL I wanted you close. In one version, I even told you. I warned you that some day they might come for me, and... 
MARY ...You'd have to leave.   How many versions were there? 
GABRIEL Ninety.   This is the last one. 
MARY Wow. 
GABRIEL I've destroyed billions of people with a thought. Obliterated them. And you'd like to think it's painless... 
MARY Stop. You don't have to explain, or apologize. Everything that is, is because of you. If that's all, that's enough. 
With that, there's really nothing more to say. 
MARY (CONT'D) So. 
GABRIEL So. 
MARY Guess you don't really need to pack anything. 
GABRIEL I'm good. 
MARY You're great. It's been a pleasure. 
GABRIEL Likewise.    I love you. 
MARY Love you, too. Ya big lug. 
He kisses her. It's not a big, passionate, movie-ending kiss, but rather a fond kiss farewell. At the end of it, he WHISPERS into her ear: 
GABRIEL You're my favorite. 
She smiles. 
With two fingers, Gabriel BREAKS the green string bracelet around his left wrist. 
And in that moment, a film passes over him, like the boundary between water and air. 
He's stepped out of this dimension. 
Mary is frozen with the same smile on her face, but we notice that she and the kitchen around her have flattened out to two- dimensional images. 
She and everything around her has become like wallpaper, slowly curling away, revealing emptiness beneath. 
Gabriel collapses into a single, spiky sphere of light. 
The light moves through the kitchen, creating waves that ripple through the tissue-thin walls. 
Picking up speed, the sphere rushes through the window, heading west. 
EXT.   LOS ANGELES - DAY 
As the light flies out over Hancock Park, the mansions and skyscrapers seem unreal, like models. 
Reaching Santa Monica, we pass over the ferris wheel at the end of the pier. 
We dive into the blue ocean beneath us, which becomes only a swirling gray fog with a viscous thickness. 
We see three lights in the distance.    We join them, moving with them.

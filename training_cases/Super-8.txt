SUPER 8

FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT December 16, 2010 
OVER BLACK WE HEAR THE DULL SOUNDS OF INDUSTRY; A MUFFLED MASS OF MACHINES, GEARS, STEAM. FADE IN ON: 
A SIGN. Twelve feet across. Painted decades earlier, grim- covered black, white and red. It reads in large 40's era, hand-painted type, "SAFETY IS OUR PRIMARY CONCERN!" Then: "DAYS SINCE LAST ACCIDENT" and below that, NUMBERS, painted on hanging metal cards. Four possible digits can hang here, but there are currently three: "784." 
SLOWLY PUSH IN on this sign as a MAN APPEARS, rising on a forklift, in a greasy, monochromatic work jumpsuit. Removes the "4" from its hooks. Then removes the "8." Then the "7." 
Finally, he hangs up a number. "1." 
The man LOWERS out of frame as we creep even closer to the hanging single digit, wondering about the accident... and how bad it was and the FACTORY SOUNDS GROW DEAFENING -- AND AS IT BUILDS TO A CRESCENDO, WE CUT TO SILENT BLACKNESS. 
EXT. JOE'S HOUSE - PORCH - DAY 
Shiny black loafers. Black pants, three inches too long. We BOOM UP, stopping at a boy's hand reaching into the black suit jacket pocket. Pulls out a WOMAN'S GOLD NECKLACE with a LOCKET. He holds the locket. Rubs it gently with his thumb. CONTINUE TO BOOM UP. We now SEE THE BOY'S FACE. 
This is JOE LAMB, 14. On the precarious edge of adulthood. He looks out at the horizon with stricken eyes. 
He moves forward and we PAN, so we're BEHIND HIM NOW. In the frosty distance, past countless leafless trees and modest homes, is a STEEL MILL. Smokestacks and structures. The lifeblood of this late 70's town. 
INT. LAMB LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Close on CHARLES' MOTHER AND FATHER, funeral attire. She looks out of the window sadly; heartsick and concerned. Behind her, he picks at his plate of food. 
CHARLES' MOTHER I'm so worried for that boy. 
CHARLES' FATHER Joe's gonna be okay. 
CHARLES' MOTHER ...she was everything to him. 
CHARLES' FATHER Jack's gonna step up. He's a good man. 
CHARLES' MOTHER But he was never really a father...I don't think he ever...understood Joe. 
CHARLES' FATHER (maybe a little concerned HIMSELF) Joe's gonna be okay. 
But his wife isn't so sure. 
Then, BOYS' HUSHED VOICES: 
INT. LAMB DINING ROOM - DAY 
CHARLES (we'll see him in a moment) LEANS FORWARD, reaching for food on a buffet table. Charles' leaning has revealed CARY, a blonde kid in a dark blue sport jacket and tie, and PRESTON, pale and smart, in a DARK SWEATER: 
CARY What do you think was in the coffin? 
MARTIN Jesus, shut up. 
CARY I mean cause of how she died. 
CARY (CONT'D) ... you weren't wondering that? 
PRESTON No, I'm eating macaroni salad. 
We now see CHARLES, big and in an ill-fitting BLACK SUIT, and MARTIN, good looking, in a shirt and tie, at the buffet: 
CHARLES I was thinking that, about the coffin. 
MARTIN I don't know how you guys can eat. 
CHARLES Try a Goddamn turkey roll and you'll discover how. They're delicious. 
CUT WIDE TO REVEAL that we are in a modest Ohio house in the year 1979. At a wake. Forty-odd friends and neighbors, darkly dressed. Quiet discussions. Some crying. 
CARY Either nothing was in there, or like whatever they scraped up-- 
MARTIN Jesus -- guys-- 
CHARLES MARTIN I heard it crushed her completely. At least keep your voices DOWN-- 
PRESTON CHARLES A steel beam-- those things weigh a ton. Literally. If it had been open casket, I would not be eating right now. Despite the turkey rolls. 
JACK (O.S.) Hey-- Lucy. 
They look up -- in the other room, a dog (mutt, Lucy) has jumped on a guest, for food. JACKSON LAMB, Joe's father, 42, black suit, moves to the dog, walks her out of shot. 
INT. 7-ELEVEN - DAY - CONTINUOUS 
Joe, Charles and Cary scan the candy aisle. 
JOE -- driving where? 
CHARLES JOE To the train depot -- did you not read the scene I just gave you? Does Alice have a license? Is she old enough? Whose car are we taking? Are you making this up? 
CHARLES Jesus, Freak Show, she offered to drive and I accepted-- 
CARY (takes scene pages) Can I see --? 
JOE -- was she nice? Why is she doing this? I don't understand, we don't even know her-- 
CHARLES Maybe she just wants to be in a good movie, y'ever think of that? 
JOE I don't think that's what it is-- 
CHARLES I've been working on this movie for months. I'm just trying to make it good. 
CARY (reading, disapproving) Hathaway's married now? Really? 
Charles swipes the pages from critic Cary. 
JOE What was she reading? 
CHARLES ... what? 
JOE In the silent reading section, what was Alice reading? 
CHARLES Who gives a rat's ass what she was reading-- the festival deadline's in one week -- my movie's gotta be great! 
CHARLES' SUPER 8 MOVIE BEING PROJECTED ON A MOVIE SCREEN. SLOWLY PUSH IN ON THE SCREEN: kids earnestly playing adults: 
INT. BUILDING 47 - DAY (SUPER 8) 
DARKNESS. Then a DOOR OPENS. It's DETECTIVE HATHAWAY (played by MARTIN), in silhouette. He enters. It's an old WAREHOUSE, dirty, cobwebbed, crowded with CRATES, old MACHINERY, CHEMICAL BARRELS and JUNK. The Detective turns on his FLASHLIGHT -- aims it -- sweeps it across the space -- the light HITTING THE LENS for a moment. 
The Detective walks through the spooky, dark space. A low, growling industrial DRONE makes the whole place oddly creepy. Then: A SOUND -- quick but strange -- slithering -- and the Detective aims his flashlight -- tense. He watches. Waits. We see where he's aiming the light, which cuts through THICK DUST in the air. It's an old office door, ajar. 
Hathaway is still. Nervous. Watching the door -- waiting for it to open... and then -- from the darkness BEHIND HIM -- a terrifying open-mouthed ZOMBIE APPEARS -- ATTACKS -- and the Detective TURNS -- his flashlight KNOCKED TO THE GROUND -- and Hathaway falls too -- the wild-eyed gaping-mouthed Zombie DROOLING as it tries to bite Hathaway's flesh -- we recognize that the Zombie is CARY. Actually, not a bad performance. The Detective pulls out his GUN -- but the Zombie grabs his wrist -- they wrestle with the gun -- the Zombie wanting to rip into Hathaway's neck -- but Hathaway sees three SHARP-TIPPED NAILS sticking out of an old piece of WOODEN CRATE -- and after a significant struggle, Hathaway PUSHES THE ZOMBIE BACK so his head is IMPALED BY THE NAILS -- which we see ENTER HIS SKULL!!! The Zombie (stuck to the crate via the nails) SCREAMS AND DIES and just at Hathaway catches his breath THE IMAGE DIMS AND FREEZES; the projector has just been STOPPED. We are in: 
INT. CHARLES' ROOM - DAY 
Board games, books, records, a stereo, toys, and magic. Super 8 film equipment and paraphernalia. Movie ONE SHEETS hang: CARRIE, HALLOWEEN, EARTHQUAKE and NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. No sports memorabilia. Charles turns on the lights, looks anxiously at Joe: 
JACK That was a good zombie murder. 
CHARLES Yeah, but it's not a st-- thank you for that-- it's not a story yet. (MORE) CHARLES (CONT'D) Older kids enter this film festival -- I'm competing with fifteen- and sixteen-year-olds, who have better stories and cars and production value, I've got nothing! 
CHARLES' MOTHER (O.S.) Charles! Dinner! 
As he tosses Joe a SUPER 8 FILMMAKER MAGAZINE: 
CHARLES I'm coming! (TO JOE) There's a whole article in there about stories, you should read it, it explains everything. 
JOE (looks at magazine) I don't understand how the wife makes it a story-- 
CHARLES CHARLES' MOTHER (O.S.) Jesus, that's what I've been explaining: in the scene we're filming tonight, the wife telling the detecting she's scared for him, that she loves him-- Charles! -- I'M COMING!!! -- so when he investigates the zombie stuff you'll be scares -- you'll feel something -- because you don't want him to die because they love each other! Does that make sense? 
JOE (CONT'D) I just can't believe you talked to Alice Dainard. 
CHARLES You're impossible. 
CHARLES' MOTHER (O.S.) CHARLES! 
CHARLES GOD, MOM! I'M COMING! (opens the door, whispers) Midnight. Okay? Don't forget. 
JOE I won't forget. 
CHARLES Read this. 
Joe just nods and looks at the magazine. 
INT. CHARLES' KITCHEN - DUSK 
A hectic FAMILY: Charles' mother cooks. JEN, his smoking hot 17-year-old sister, ANGRILY sets the table where his father pays bills. Pale 15-year-old sister PEG does a PUZZLE. Twin 9- YEAR-OLD BOYS bicker over an action figure. TV in the living room plays a MATCH GAME. Joe and Charles enter. 
JEN Mom, it's not fair that I can't go to Wendy's. Every single person is going except me! 
CHARLES' MOTHER Then every single person can tell you how it was -- 
JOE I won't. Over. 
Joe turns off the walkie -- and he grabs a small plastic FISHERMAN'S TACKLE BOX as we HEAR: 
CHARLES (V.O.) Wanna hear something gross? 
CARY (V.O.) I do. 
MARTIN (V.O.) No please, if you're really asking. 
EXT. JOE'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Midnight. Sitting on the curb with their GEAR and talking quietly, are Joe, Charles, Martin, Preston and Cary. Martin dressed in his detecting SUIT. Joe eats from a bag of Twizzlers. 
CHARLES I sneezed so hard yesterday I shit my pants. (THEY MOAN) I debated telling you. 
JOE Thanks. 
PRESTON That's called a "sharteeze" by the way. 
CHARLES CARY Well then I totally sharteezed in my pants. That's exactly what I'm talking about: the world is crazy, there's a name for everything... 
CHARLES Twizzler me. 
Joe passes him a Twizzler. 
MARTIN So... people are turning into zombies because of the chemical factory, right? 
CHARLES Martin? I don't see how the guy playing Detective Hathaway can ask where the zombies are coming from. 
CARY Another classic from Smartin. 
MARTIN I told you, I don't like it when you call me that. 
CARY I'm sorry, Smartin. 
MARTIN Shut up. 
JOE GUYS-- 
All the boys look. Their faces BRIGHTEN. Headlights. The boys stand as the car STOPS beside them -- IT'S THE YELLOW BUICK WITH THE BLACK RACING STRIPE THAT PULLED UP TO JOE'S HOUSE DURING THE WAKE. But now, sitting in the driver's seat is 14- year-old ALICE DAINARD. She sees Joe. 
ALICE Joe Lamb?! 
JOE -- yeah? 
ALICE What the hell's he doing here? 
CHARLES Make-up, sound and special effects. 
ALICE He's the deputy's kid! 
CHARLES JOE -- what? (touch flattered) -- you knew that? 
ALICE (CONT'D) Charles, I don't have a license. I can't drive with him! 
CHARLES You want Joe to-- stay back? I--? 
ALICE It's too late! He's seeing me in this car right now. 
JOE You can trust me. My dad'll never know. I won't tell him anything. 
Looking away, she's pissed. All the boys in silent wait. She considers, annoyed. Shakes her head. Finally: 
ALICE Get in. 
The boys EXCITEDLY SCRAMBLE into the car. 
EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT 
The Buick crosses the nighttime horizon, leaving the small town, driving through a rural landscape. 
PRESTON (V.O.) (TERRIFIED) You're driving very well. I'm impressed. 
INT. BUICK - NIGHT 
Alice drives. The boys shoved in the back with the gear -- in front Charles struggles with his backpack and camera bags as he pulls out PAGES, arranging them. With her driving, there's an unusual, electric energy in the air. Joe eats his Twizzlers in the back, trying not to stare at Alice. 
CHARLES So I wrote a couple new lines, can I show you? 
ALICE What? 
CHARLES Martin, I have a new line for you. 
He gets up to reveal Joe putting make-up on Alice. He walks over to Martin, Cary and Preston. Charles and Martin AD LIB. 
TIGHT ON JOE'S TACKLE BOX, which opens. Inside is an assortment of MAKE-UPS, sponges, cotton balls, brushes, derma wax, spirit gum, and a large jar of FAKE BLOOD. Joe is preparing to make up Alice, who sits in front of him, watching carefully as Joe prepares BASE MAKE-UP on a sponge. He looks to her. A beat. 
JOE You mind? 
Alice shakes her head: nope. Joe starts stippling the make-up onto her face. He is now, via sponge, touching the face of a girl he's admired for some time. After a beat: 
ALICE My dad works at the mill. 
And she looks at him. Almost as if she were looking for something. Joe stops stippling. The tension is almost too much for him to bear. 
JOE Close you eyes. Please. 
He indicates the sponge: it's for the make-up. She does. Joe starts applying the make-up to her eyelids. There's something provocative for Joe, being so close to Alice, with her eyes closed. Then, PRE-LAP: 
CHARLES (O.S.) So this is very emotional. 
EXT. TRAIN DEPOT - PLATFORM - NIGHT 
The lights (plugged into the car cigarette lighter) and camera (a EUMIG) are set. Alice has been made up, wears a coat with purse. Martin, in his tie, faces her. They both look over their script pages as Charles adjusts the camera. 
Joe, observing, holds the boom mike (a condenser mike taped to a broom handle), Preston wears an overcoat. 
CHARLES Alice: Mrs. Hathaway really doesn't want her husband to keep investiga-- 
ALICE I know, we read it, we get it. 
CHARLES Okay, I'm just directing. Martin get on your mark. Martin, you're going to have to reassure her. Do you know what "reassure her" means? 
MARTIN Yeah, I think so. 
CHARLES Okay-- we're starting on Alice's side first-- Preston: a couple seconds after "action" walk to the pay phone, make it look like this place is busy-- 
PRESTON I know what that looks like. 
POP! Everyone JUMPS -- Charles turns -- Cary, laughing, has just exploded a firecracker: 
CHARLES Asshole, could you stop blowing shit up for two seconds and deal with the camera? 
CARY Sorry man. 
CHARLES Let's rehearse this -- save your real performances for when we're filming, though. 
Martin and Alice put away their pages -- Cary gets behind the camera. Charles stands near the camera, kneeling to camera- height. Joe wears headphones and holds the boom over the actors' heads. Preston holds a suitcase, ready to walk. 
CHARLES (CONT'D) Ready? Here we go... action! 
Martin and Alice now perform as their characters, DETECTIVE JOHN HATHAWAY and MRS. REBECCA HATHAWAY: 
DETECTIVE HATHAWAY I'm going to stay here and investigate. I think it would be safer if you leave town. 
MRS. HATHAWAY John. I don't like it. This case. These murders. 
DETECTIVE HATHAWAY What am I supposed to do, go to Michigan with you? 
Preston walks past them, acting in the background. 
MRS. HATHAWAY Mackinac Island's beautiful this time of year. 
We're TIGHT ON JOE NOW, watching Alice. Slowly amazed at the unexpected depth and truth she brings to this role -- 
DETECTIVE HATHAWAY Sweetheart. This is my job. 
MRS. HATHAWAY The dead, coming back to life...? I think you're in danger-- 
DETECTIVE HATHAWAY I have no choice-- 
MRS. HATHAWAY You do have a choice. We all do... 
And holy shit, Alice actually starts to cry as she performs her lines. Not overdone, not hammy. Just fucking real. 
MRS. HATHAWAY (CONT'D) John, I've never asked you to stop. I've never asked you to give up or walk away. 
Charles watches -- in awe -- he's suddenly, giddily transported. But it's JOE who, as he stares, becomes galvanized; any vague interest in Alice has just set: 
MRS. HATHAWAY (CONT'D) But I'm asking you now-- please. For me. Don't go back. Don't leave me. (MORE) MRS. HATHAWAY (CONT'D) I need to know this isn't the last time I'll see you. (BEAT) I just love you so much. 
Martin is thrown by the passion and heart of her performance. 
In the DUST, JOE lies frightened on the ground, eyes tightly shut. His mind races, his heart pounds -- and then: A LOUD METAL BANG! Joe stands up fast, faces a MOUNTAIN of twisted STEEL -- UPSIDE-DOWN TRAIN CARS PILED FRIGHTENINGLY around him. Just another few feet and he would've been crushed. But what was that sound? Something metal? Then again: SLAM! Joe BACKS UP, afraid -- it was almost a LABORED GROAN -- MECHANICAL or ANIMAL?! A crazy SCREECH, another BANG, then AGAIN and AGAIN!!! 
We see Joe TIGHTLY GRIPPING HIS NECKLACE LOCKET IN HIS HAND -- THEN: CRASH! -- AWFUL-LOUD -- and a TWISTED TEN-FOOT SQUARE SHEET OF METAL EXPLODES FROM BEHIND THE OVERTURNED TRAIN CARS -- Joe covers his head as the metal STABS THE GROUND, twenty feet away: a TRAIN SLIDING DOOR. Joe turns to see it -- stunned -- then back to the direction of the NOISE -- but it is GONE. Nothing. 
TIGHT ON CHARLES' CAMERA -- on its side, FINISHING UP A CARTRIDGE OF FILM. 
JOE (O.S.) Guys?! 
Joe finds MARTIN, on his knees, THROWING UP -- Martin keeps throwing up, but pumps a THUMBS UP. 
JOE (CONT'D) Martin, are you okay?! Preston, is that you? 
PRESTON I'm okay! Though I think I'm having a heart attack! And I have a scrape! 
Joe MOVES FORWARD -- up to camera -- behind him, Cary appears, smiling. This kid enjoyed the crash: 
CARY Guys, did you see those explosions? That was awesome. 
JOE Has anyone seen Alice?! 
CHARLES (O.S.) I'm alive! Is anyone dead? 
Through the debris, steel and dust. Joe moves forward -- Charles, shaken, eyes wide, appears through the thick dust -- 
Joe moves forward, looking at, under a train WHEEL ASSEMBLY... BLOOD. A PUDDLE OF BLOOD and Joe's heart sinks as he moves toward it -- another woman he loves, crushed?! Charles and Preston and Cary see the blood -- 
CHARLES (CONT'D) PRESTON -- oh God-- -- no -- nonono... 
Martin, still sick, calls out: 
MARTIN CARY -- what? Guys, what is it? ... shit... 
Joe moves closer to the blood -- heartsick -- on the verge of DEEP, REAL TEARS -- everything stops -- but then: 
ALICE (O.S.) -- what's all that blood? 
Joe WHIPS AROUND -- standing in the dusty mess is ALICE -- shaken, but absolutely alive. Joe just BEAMS. 
ALICE (CONT'D) What's the blood? -- did someone get hurt--? 
But JOE SUDDENLY KNOWS -- he moves to the blood -- reaches below the wheels -- the others watch, freaked out -- 
KIDS (AD LIB) Joe, wait -- maybe you shouldn't touch -- what are you-- careful! 
Joe pulls out his CRUSHED MAKE-UP KIT. He brightens: 
JOE It's my fake blood. It's fake! 
CHARLES What is this stuff? 
ALICE NOTICES THAT HE'S HOLDING THE NECKLACE. Joe notices this and POCKETS IT self-consciously. PRESTON calls out: 
PRESTON Guys, what are these things? 
Joe looks -- they all move to Preston (except Cary, who heads off): CRATES have spilled from a nearby split car; many shattered, revealing THOUSANDS OF SMALL WHITE-METAL CUBES which now litter the ground. Joe kneels, picks one up: 
MARTIN Hey, don't touch it, what are you doing? 
CHARLES They look like white Rubik's cubes or something. They're heavy like metal or something. There's like a billion of them. 
It's just a few inches per side, an UNUSUAL DESIGN. Behind them, having walked up the ANGLED SIDES of overturned train cars, Cary calls out: 
CARY Guys, get up here. You can see everything from up here. 
They move up the mass of metal, revealing a VAST VIEW OF THE WRECK. It seems to stretch on forever. It is SOBERING. 
CHARLES CARY Oh my God. ... Look at that... 
PRESTON According to my Uncle Seth, an accident like this is exceptionally rare. 
JOE It wasn't an accident. (turns away, eyes on the FIELD) There was a truck. On the tracks. 
CHARLES What? Driving on the tracks? 
Joe's seen it. He points. Chilled. 
JOE There. 
Thrown fifty yards from the main wreckage is THE PICK-UP TRUCK. SHEARED IN HALF UPON IMPACT and lying in the overgrown grass. 
MARTIN How can a pick-up truck derail a train? That's impossible. 
Alice hurries past, hunting for her keys in that big purse -- she eyes the FLASHLIGHT MEN getting closer: 
ALICE MOVE YOUR ASS, WE GOTTA GO!!! 
Joe grabs his make-up kit -- another duffel -- runs for the car, past a whining Charles. 
JOE GET IN THE CAR!!! 
As the FLASHLIGHT MEN APPROACH, Joe runs and gets in the front seat, the other boys in back -- Alice SLAMS the car into REVERSE, SCREECH-BACKS UP, narrowly avoids debris, then RIDES OFF -- the FLASHLIGHT MEN arrive -- SOLDIERS -- their adrenaline pumping. One man who WALKS UP TO THE CAMERA, eyeing the vanishing car with intense suspicion: COLONEL NELEC. He then looks to the ground in front of him. 
CLOSE ON A FRESH, EMPTY YELLOW SUPER 8 FILM BOX. Nelec steps to it, picks it up. Looks at it. Then back up at the disappearing car. We PUSH IN ON HIS BURNING EYES AND -- 
EXT. OHIO ROAD - NIGHT 
RRRRRRRROOOOOOOOOAAAAAARRRRRRRR! The Buick speeds past. 
INT. BUICK - NIGHT 
Overlapping mayhem, but Charles obsesses over his camera: 
CHARLES PRESTON Holy shit, that was insane! He had a gun! An actual physical gun! 
CARY CHARLES I can't believe all that just happened here! Nothing ever My whole camera lends is like happens here!!! shattered now! 
PRESTON My heart is pounding! That train could of killed us. 
JOE (TO ALICE) Are you okay? 
As Alice nervously drives, she shakes her head: no. 
CHARLES Oh shit, all the glass just fell out! 
MARTIN I HAVE NEVER HAD A TEACHER AIM A GUN AT ME! 
ALICE It's hard enough to drive without everyone yelling! 
JOE Guys, keep it down! 
CARY JOE Joe: what was Woodward talking about? I don't know, I don't know-- 
MARTIN I'm never taking a train again. 
PRESTON "You'll die, your parents will die," guys, that is not good information. 
CHARLES Great, the focus ring just fell off! 
CARY No one cares about your CAMERA! 
MARTIN Am I the only one shaking?! I'm also crying -- 
ALICE We can't tell anyone we were there - - we can't say a thing about it -- my dad cannot find out I took his car, do you guys hear me?! 
JOE It's okay-- no one's saying anything. None of us. (to his friends) Guys -- we're not gonna say anything -- are we?! 
The boys all muster, "no's." Joe turns sweetly to Alice. 
JOE (CONT'D) See? No one's gonna know. 
Alice nods; if not quite relieved, at least grateful for Joe. But they all stare off for a long beat... haunted. 
EXT. ROAD - NIGHT 
The Buick SPEEDS AWAY... 
EXT. JOE'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
CRANE DOWN as the Buick pulls up. The dusty boys pile out. They all kind of look at each other. What a night. Charles, who looks at Joe for a beat, holds up his defunct camera on the tripod. Joe nods. 
Alice finds something on the passenger seat and holds it out. 
ALICE Joe, this is yours. 
Joe goes to the window. Alice holds it out: THE CUBE. He takes it with: 
JOE -- oh, thanks, 
ALICE I should never have done this. 
She just drives away. Left there are Joe, Charles, Preston, Cary and Martin. They all kind of look at Alice go. 
INT. JOE'S BATHROOM - NIGHT 
CHARLES JOE (turns to him) --okay-- Holy shit, that's mint. You're a total brain--! We gotta get the camera fixed and the film developed from last night-- I gotta go steal some more money from my mom! 
EXT. LILLIAN, OHIO - BRIDGE - MORNING 
Joe and Charles ride their bikes into town, across a BRIDGE, the massive STEEL MILL in the background -- 
CHARLES If any of the footage from last night is usable, that means we need Alice to play the wife again. 
JOE Yeah, I thought she was good. 
CHARLES She was mint, but she's never gonna do it. 
JOE I think she will. 
CHARLES There's no way. You heard what she said. 
JOE But that was before the new pages, right? 
CHARLES You honestly think she cares about the scenes? 
EXT. LILLIAN, OHIO - MAIN STREET - DAY 
TILT DOWN from the town's WATER TOWER -- Joe and Charles ride their bikes underneath it, crossing Main Street -- two large MILITARY TRUCKS drive past, we may note the Airman in the passenger seat SCANS THE AREA with a handheld device. 
CHARLES Man, did you hear what she said last night? "I never should have done this!" Dude, she was totally wigged! 
JOE Yes, she was, we all were. 
CHARLES Did you see her face? 
JOE Yeah, I saw her face. 
CHARLES Man, what's wrong with you? 
JOE Nothing. I think she's going to do it. 
They park their bikes outside OLSEN CAMERA AND HI-FI. 
INSERT - WHITE PAGES 
The book opens -- Joe's finger goes down -- finds "LOUIS DAINARD" and the phone number. We're in: 
INT. OLSEN CAMERA AND HI-FI - MORNING 
Joe at the counter, DIALING THE ROTARY PHONE, Charles behind him with DONNY, the 19-year-old, dark-haired, bearded salesman with a big collared button-down shirt. 
CHARLES Lens is cracked. Focus ring broke. (BEAT) Ya think it's fixable? 
Joe HEARS Alice's phone number RINGING. 
DONNY I think it's cheaper to buy a new one. 
CHARLES (TO JOE) We're screwed, man, it's over! 
JOE ALICE (V.O.) We can use my dad's camera -- it's got sound and-- Hello? 
JOE Alice-- hi, it's Joe. Lamb. 
As Charles opens the camera, pulls out the film: 
ALICE (V.O.) Hi... 
JOE So we have some new scenes. For the movie. We were hoping you'd be in `em. 
ALICE (V.O.) Oh-- no. No, I'm done with that. 
Joe twirls a hanging Kodak "RELIVE THE MEMORIES" SUPER 8 film PROMOTIONAL SIGN, speaking in a soft voice: 
JOE Really? `Cause these are really good scenes. 
Charles hands the film cartridge to Donny. 
CHARLES We need this developed as soon as possible -- can you do overnight? 
DONNY Asshole, no one can do overnight. You wanna buy some pot? 
Charles reacts; he's never smoked anything. 
CHARLES ... no, thank you. 
DONNY You guys are weak. 
Breen doesn't respond. The sheriff throws a candy bar at him. 
SHERIFF PRUITT (CONT'D) Breen. 
Breen pulls off the headphones. 
BREEN Hey, Sheriff. 
SHERIFF PRUITT What's that? 
BREEN Walkman. It's like a stereo, play your own cassette tapes. (OFFERS HEADPHONES) You wanna try it? 
SHERIFF PRUITT (pays for the candy bars) I don't think so. Kids walking around with their own stereos. Just what we need. It's a slippery slope. 
He exits the store. 
BREEN ... yessir. 
Pruitt heads out; Breen puts the headphones on again. 
EXT. KELVIN GAS STATION - NIGHT 
We see we're at the lonely gas station the kids drove past earlier. Pruitt's SQUAD CAR filling up, the only car here. High overhead, a yellow KELVIN sign TURNS atop a tall pole near the road. Pruitt crosses to his car. Peels the candy bar. Hearing something, he turns -- a PACK OF DOGS RUN BY. A DISTANT SHOT AS THE LIGHTS ALL MOMENTARILY DIM AND FLICKER. CLOSE UP of the PUMP'S SPINNING white NUMBER on black; the gallons and dollar amount blurring higher -- then A BIZARRE REFLECTION -- Pruitt sees it, turns -- and what he sees is TALL AND TERRIFYING -- he DROPS THE CANDY -- GOES FOR HIS GUN, BUT -- 
INT. KELVIN GAS STATION - NIGHT 
Breen, eyes closed, blasts his Walkman (we only hear TINNY MUSIC) as, through the window behind him, the rear of the squad car SUDDENLY SPRINGS UPWARD VIOLENTLY as if the FRONT SECTION WAS SUDDENLY CRUSHED! PRUITT SCREAMS, MUFFLED, as the CAR SLAMS back to the pavement -- LIGHTS FLICKER -- 
EXT. KELVIN GAS STATION - NIGHT 
Gas PUMPING onto the asphalt, SCREAMS OF PRUITT, horrible, CONFOUNDING -- 
INT. KELVIN GAS STATION - NIGHT 
PRUITT'S SCREAMS END as Breen OPENS HIS EYES AND RIPS off the headphones: the hell was that? He looks outside -- sees the car -- shattered windows. Confused, he heads out -- 
EXT. KELVIN GAS STATION - NIGHT 
Breen moves tentatively toward the CRUSHED CAR -- quickly glances for Pruitt, who's missing. He gets close to the car, confounded by what he sees -- hands shaking, he rights the pump and replaces it. His heart pounds as he starts for the building -- but SLIPS ON THE GAS -- falls hard -- looks up -- sees whatever's coming for him -- SCREAMS as he gets to his feet and RUNS LIKE A MOTHERFUCKER -- 
INT. KELVIN GAS STATION - NIGHT 
Breen RUSHES INSIDE -- we're WITH HIM as behind him: KKKRASH!!!! An EXPLOSION OF GLASS AND JUNK FOOD and -- 
EXT. KELVIN GAS STATION - NIGHT 
WE LOOK DOWN UPON THE STATION FROM UP HIGH -- where the turning, lit KELVIN SIGN BLOCKS OUR VIEW FOR THE MOMENT -- we can only HEAR THE HORROR happening inside the station until FINALLY the sign REVEALS THE STATION -- everything inside looks like it's in a BLENDER -- THERE'S A SUPER-HUMAN UPHEAVAL HAPPENING IN THERE -- and Breen's SCREAMS CONTINUE as the turning Kelvin sign BLOCKS OUR VIEW AGAIN -- as the SOUND GETS UNBEARABLE, A SUDDEN CUT TO: 
A FACE. A MAKE-UP BRUSH APPLYING MAKE-UP. It's ALICE, and she's becoming a ZOMBIE. We are: 
INT. CHARLES' KITCHEN - DAY 
Joe makes her up -- a not half-bad, simple ZOMBIE MAKE-UP. Pale skin, sunken eyes and cheekbones. In the background, the other kids prepare to film. 
He hands her a mirror, she gazes into it, sort of amazed. 
ALICE Where'd you learn how to do this? 
JOE Mostly the Dick Smith Monster Make- up Handbook. 
She nods. Whatever. Charles is suddenly there, with Cary: 
CHARLES Hey! So I'm gonna need more shots of the train crash, obviously-- you know that train model you made? Can we blow it up and film it? 
Joe doesn't want to do this at all. AT ALL. But... 
JOE ... sure. 
CHARLES CARY Mint. Gnarly! 
Charles and Cary head off, planning the explosions. Alice looks at him knowingly. 
JOE (CONT'D) I don't care, they can blow it up. I can show you the train, it's nothing, it's stupid. (BEAT) (MORE) JOE (CONT'D) You wanna see it? Later? The... train? My train model? The train I made? 
The LIGHTS IN THE HOUSE DIM -- BROWN OUT -- then back on. 
CHARLES MARTIN That's like the third time Dude. Bitchen. that's happened. 
ALICE So how am I supposed to be a zombie? 
JOE Oh. Just be a lifeless ghoul. Someone with no soul, dead eyes. Scary. D'you ever have Mrs. Mullin? 
Then we see the REVERSE -- SLOWLY PULLING BACK -- REVEALING THAT THERE ARE DOZENS AND DOZENS OF BRAND NEW "DOG MISSING" SIGNS POSTED ON THE BOARD. It's COVERED in them. Joe is so stunned, he doesn't notice the MILITARY TRUCKS that pass in the background behind him. 
INT. JOE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT 
KA-BAM: back door opens, Joe enters. EMPTY PIZZA BOX on the table. Jack and four POLICE OFFICERS in the living room, smoking, reviewing POLICE REPORTS, marking MAPS, taking notes -- WORKING ON THE PROBLEMS THEY'RE HAVING -- 
OFFICER MIKE We need more help around here. 
OFFICER GORDON We've got four men on the Pruitt case alone. We've called into Dayton, they'll be out in the MORNING---- 
JACK That's not enough. People don't feel safe here -- and you know why? `Cause they're not-- 
The officers agree. Joe moves into the doorway where his dad and other convene. 
JACK (CONT'D) -- the Air Force isn't answering a damn question: they've got trucks at Woodward's house, looking for SOMETHING -- 
OFFICER They've got trucks all over town. 
OFFICER JAY I saw a guy riding shotgun in one of those trucks -- had some kind of scanner in his hand -- 
DEPUTY TALLY --like a Geiger counter or SOMETHING-- 
JACK I know. They're saying it's just clean-up at the train crash, but they're taking molds of tire tracks. Which means they're looking for someone-- now what's that about? 
Joe has heard this and DROPPED HIS FLASHLIGHT -- the men all turn, silent. Joe, on the spot: 
JOE -- have you... seen Lucy? 
JACK I'm sure she's around. I put a couple of slices in the fridge for you there. 
DEPUTY TALLY -- oh-- I ate those. Sorry, Kid-- 
JOE That's... okay, I'll find a-- 
Then the POWER GOES OUT -- the men react -- it FLICKERS ON AND OFF -- Jack grabs his radio a the POWER RETURNS: 
JACK Vicky, you got power at the station? 
DISPATCH (V.O.) On and off. Brook County's in the dark. 
JACK Get water and power out there now. 
INT. JOE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Joe paints his model on the floor of his living room, watching In Search Of and talking to Charles on his walkie talkie. 
JOE So the Air Force is looking for a car -- Alice's dad's car -- they're taking tire prints from the crash site. Over. 
CHARLES I don't wanna hear about it. They could be monitoring us right now! Jesus, shut up. Over! 
JOE (VERY CONCERNED) And the military's at Woodward's house. Looking for his research. Whatever that means? 
CHARLES Joe -- YOU CAN NOT FLAKE OUT ON ME AND BE A DICK! Are you gonna come help me tomorrow or not? I need you to make Alice a zombie again. 
And Joe tries to snap himself out of it. But is disturbed. 
JOE Okay... I'll do the make-up. Over. 
EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT 
WIDE SHOT: middle of nowhere wooded area as an OHIO POWER CHERRY PICKER TRUCK drives up, parks beside a UTILITY POLE. 
INT. DWP CHERRY PICKER - NIGHT 
ROONEY, 49. Cigarette in his mouth, makes notes on a weathered clipboard. Glances at the power line. Doesn't understand what he sees -- PUSH IN ON HIM. He radios in: 
ROONEY This is Rooney at Mary-10, was there re-routing on this line? 
VOICE (V.O.) Negative, but the grid through Liberty is dark. 
ROONEY ... yeah, `cause there's no overhead lines on these poles. 
VOICE (V.O.) -- come again? 
ROONEY No power, no comm cables. Stand by. 
He DRIVES AGAIN -- we see a WIDE SHOT OF THE LANDSCAPE -- HALF A DOZEN UTILITY POLES -- ALL BARE -- NOT ONE WIRE. 
EXT. SALVAGE YARD ROAD - NIGHT 
The truck comes to a stop, roadside. Tall trees and a SALVAGE YARD behind them. PUSH IN ON ROONEY who calls in: 
ROSKO No. What? 
JACK Hey Danny, you have a radio scanner with a descrambler don't you? 
DANNY Voice inverter, yeah. 
JACK Whatever, get it down and set it up for me. 
ROSKO What is this? 
JACK I think the Air Force is using UNASSIGNED CHANNELS-- 
He heads for his office, seeing LOUIS, who is being escorted out by an Officer across the room. 
LOUIS Hey -- he was at my house yesterday morning, are you aware of that? 
OFFICER ROSKO (quiet to Jack) We brought him in about the car lot and other things -- he's clean. 
LOUIS I'd appreciate it if you would inform your son that my house if off-limits. And so it my daughter. 
Louis heads out -- HOLD ON JACK AS he turns, ENTERS HIS OFFICE, and as that door opens, we CUT TO: 
INT. JOE'S ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON 
The door opens of his messy, motherless room. Joe and Alice enter. He could not be more self-conscious. He moves stacks of comic, tosses some dirty clothes behind the bed -- pair of underwear and socks. He closes the closet and hangs a bath towel on his desk chair. She looks around sa she enters. The light dim, intimate. 
JOE Oh gawd, I didn't clean up. 
Joe quickly moves a pile of papers and books from the desk to the floor; NOTEBOOKS AND SCHOOL WORK spill out and we get a GLIMPSE of some "B-MINUSES" and other "C-PLUSES" in RED. 
Joe, embarrassed, hides them, then moves to his MODELS: 
ALICE -- you made all these? 
JOE Yeah, that's the Hunchback of Notre Dame. I watched that one on TV. HERE--- 
Alice sits on the bed. Joe takes the FIVE-CAR TRAIN MODEL. She moves close: 
JOE (CONT'D) This is the train they wanna destroy. 
Alice hold it. Joe watches her. She really looks at it. 
ALICE ... it looks real. (beat, studies) It looks so old... 
JOE That's dry brush technique. (off her look) After you've painted the base color, you take something like... (grabs up Testors bottle) Euro Gray. 
Her face is so close to his. Her hair touches his ear. 
ALICE Euro Gray... 
JOE There are so many different grays, it's crazy. And you pour a little onto like a paper plate. Then you take a dry brush and you just dip it in, then you brush on the paper, so the paint's barely on the brush. Then you make small brush strokes on the model. Little ones, like where the wear and tear would be. Around the wheels. Or where the doors would slide. Then you do it again, like with Camouflage Gray-- or here, I used Insignia Red to make it look like there was another coat of paint on there before. Like they painted over it, but you could see it scratched off. 
Lost in thought, he looks at her. Suddenly self-conscious. 
ALICE What was that necklace? (off his awkward stare) The one you were holding at the train crash. Was it your mom's? 
It takes him a beat. Finally: 
JOE My dad gave it to her the day I was born. She wears it all the time. Used to. (BEAT) It was bad, how she-- died and stuff, but they got the necklace back. So. 
Their tension INTERRUPTED BY an out of breath Charles: 
CHARLES Guys, what the hell?! No one knew where you were. 
JOE We're sitting right here. 
CHARLES You gotta be the soldier. 
JOE I thought you were calling Evan. 
CHARLES Evan blew us off, he's a pussy. (TO ALICE) Excuse me. 
ALICE It's okay. 
CHARLES You gotta do it. You're the only one. 
INT. POLICE STATION - JACK'S OFFICE - DAY 
Jack with OFFICER TALLY (24): 
JACK The hell do you mean you "found my dog in Brookville?" That's a DIFFERENT COUNTY-- 
OVERMYER Sixty boxes in the basement, maybe more. 
NELEC What, more tax returns? 
OVERMYER It's here somewhere. If we can't find it, Woodward'll tell us where it is. 
But Nelec has seen something outside: THE KIDS. 
NELEC ... the hell's that? 
OVERMYER ... looks like kids making a movie... 
Behind them, a WINDOW, showing the street, where Jack insists Joe get into the car. Nelec looks out -- sees Jack take Joe by the arm, grab the tripod and head to his squad car. 
EXT. WOORWARD'S HOUSE - DAY 
As Jack gets out, he sees the kids and isn't happy. He moves toward Joe and his friends: 
CHARLES Joe. (TO JACK) Hey, Mr. Lamb! 
Joe spins around as Jack arrives, grabs his camera from Charles and saying firmly, to Joe: 
JACK Get in the car. 
Joe is stunned -- instantly humiliated in front of Alice -- he's taken back to the squad car -- 
CHARLES Uh-- Mr. Lamb? That's your camera, but technically, that's my film-- 
Jack OPENS the car's back door -- Joe gets in -- Jack SLAMS it shut, then throws the camera and tripod into the passenger seat and SLAMS that door, heading to the house, leaving Joe in the back. Nelec heads outside -- Jack moves to him: 
NELEC I would like to help you out deputy. I really would. But we operate on a need to know basis. 
JACK Why are your trucks sweeping the town? 
NELEC We'll be out of your way shortly. 
JACK Then I'm sure you wouldn't mind me contacting DC. Talk to some friends about "Walking Distance." 
This lands on Nelec. 
JACK (CONT'D) All right. We'll do it that way. 
Jack heads off. 
NELEC Deputy. (JACK TURNS) Let's talk. Just not here. 
Jack stops, turns to uncomfortable Nelec. 
INT. SQUAD CAR - DAY 
Joe, his breathing heavying, sits in the car, heart pounding, watching his father move over to talk to Nelec, close again. Then he looks over at his friends -- Charles giving him a "WHAT THE FUCK?!" Look. Alice watches him sympathetically. She mouths to him a guilty, "...is it me...?" And Joe shakes his head: "No." But we -- and she -- know better. 
EXT. JOE'S HOUSE - DAY 
The squad car pulls up. Jack gets out, Joe follows -- THE CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL THAT WE ARE: 
INT. JOE'S HOUSE - DAY 
Door opens. Jack enters, then lets Joe pass him. Joe closes the door hard and says, angrily, but restrained: 
JACK This is new. All this. For the both of us. Dealing with-- all this, just us. So I'm going to make this as clear and simple as I can: You're not friends with Alice Dainard. When I say no, I don't mean maybe. I don't mean yes. I mean no. I've known Louis Dainard for alotta years-- he's been nothing but trouble. Your mother used to say he's not a bad guy, he just needs a chance, he's just sad - - well I tried to be good to him, but I can't. Not anymore. I will not allow him or his daughter in this house. I will not allow you spending time with her, doing projects or whatever it is that you're doing. THAT'S IT. I hope we're clear. 
Jack turns to leave -- but Joe, enraged, says: 
JOE We're not clear. 
Jack stops -- stunned -- Joe's heart pounds -- 
JACK What'd you say? 
JOE We're not clear. You and I aren't clear about anything. We couldn't be less clear. 
JACK Joseph Francis Lamb-- 
JOE (ERUPTING) Just `cause mom died doesn't mean you know anything about me!!! You don't. You don't know about Alice either -- she's kind! 
JACK I'm not having this discussion with you--! 
JOE She's NICE to me! 
JACK I don't care what she is! Her father is a selfish, irresponsible son-of-a-bitch! 
JOE -- no, I totally do, I'm just... sort of in shock at this whole CONVERSATION-- 
And the POWER RETURNS -- Joe's CLOCK LIGHT goes on behind him -- but more chilling, the PROJECTOR comes back on; the SILENT HOME MOVIE OF HIS MOTHER PLAYS. Joe crawls to the projector to stop it -- but: 
ALICE -- no, keep it-- please -- 
Alice moves closer to the screen. Joe sits behind her. She watches the film. Can't take her eyes away. 
ALICE (CONT'D) ... is that her? 
JOE ... yeah... 
And as Alice watches, we GENTLY PUSH IN... as tears start to fill her eyes. Behind her, at a near WHISPER: 
JOE (CONT'D) ... it's so weird watching her like this, like she's still here... (beat, lost in it) ... she used to look at me, this way... like really look. And I just... knew I was there. That I existed. 
A tear drops down Alice's face, though Joe can't see that. Finally, quietly: 
ALICE He drank that morning. My dad. (BEAT) He missed his shift. (beat, hard) Your mom took it for him. The day of the accident. 
Watching his mother, Joe is quietly stunned. Finally, eyes wet, Alice turns to Joe. 
ALICE (CONT'D) ... I know he wishes it was him. Instead of her. (HARD BEAT) ... and sometimes I wish it was, too. 
Joe just stares at her... heartsick and speechless. Finally: 
JOE Don't say that. (BEAT) He's your dad. 
Just then, the SUPER 8 movie ENDS: the film FLIPFLIPFLIPS. Joe turns off the projector -- but a SOUND REMAINS. A sort of SHUDDER-HUM. Joe unplugs the projector, but the sound remains. Then they look: THE SHUDDERING IS COMING FROM THE CUBE HE TOOK FROM THE CRASH SITE, sitting on his desk. 
Joe and Alice move to it. He turns on his desk lamp. The cube VIBRATES, almost imperceptibly. 
ALICE JOE -- has this--? -- no. 
Joe opens a drawer, grabs a paintbrush -- he touches the cube -- the thing SHUDDERS ON ITS OWN. 
They are amazed. They get LOW -- eyes at desk level -- the SHUDDERING INCREASES IN PITCH AND VOLUME -- he reaches out to touch it with his finger, but suddenly the cube BULLETS AWAY - - ACROSS THE ROOM -- AND BLASTS THROUGH THE WALL, LEAVING A FIVE-INCH HOLE IN THE WALL! She screams -- they both fall to the floor, STUNNED -- PUSH IN ON Joe, his heart pounding. He moves to the wall -- looks through the hole: in the distance, trees and the TOWN WATER TOWER. 
INT. ALICE'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Alice enters the dark house quietly. She steps carefully toward her room, when -- 
LOUIS (O.S.) Morning. 
His voice makes her JUMP. She turns: sitting in the dark, in an armchair, is her father. He's awake. And drunk. 
LOUIS (CONT'D) You wanna tell me where you were? Or you want me to tell you. 
A tense beat, her mind races. Breathe, Alice, just breathe. 
LOUIS (CONT'D) Sit down. 
ALICE I should go to bed. 
LOUIS I wanna talk to you. I said sit down. 
ALICE I don't want to sit down. 
LOUIS Then go. Be just like your mother and leave. 
This kills her -- but she does: she leaves the house. 
LOUIS (CONT'D) GO AHEAD, GO! 
EXT. ALICE'S HOUSE - PRE-DAWN 
Alice, crying, gets on her bike and rides off -- a DISTANT FIERY GLOW past the factory and over the hills. The front door opens -- Louis comes out and yells, miserable: 
LOUIS ALICE!!! WAIT!!! 
But she's far gone -- Louis' mind races -- he runs to his BUICK -- starts it up -- PULLS OUT FAST and goes after her -- 
EXT. LILLIAN STREET - PRE-DAWN 
Alice PEDALS HARD, she wants to escape everywhere. No cars on the street, no people. A block behind her, SCREECH: a CAR turns onto the road. Her father's car -- she makes a turn -- 
INT. BUICK - PRE-DAWN 
We're with Louis as he drive -- clearly drunk -- 
EXT. SHARP TURN ROAD - PRE-DAWN 
JOE Why? 
CHARLES There's nothing wrong-- 
As we CONTINUE BOOMING UP, we arrive at the top of the WATER TOWER, where THE CUBE HAS AFFIXED ITSELF TO THE SIDE -- unseen from the street. In the distance, THE THREATENING FIRE SMOKE LOOMS -- 
EXT. CHARLES' HOUSE - DAY 
As Joe and Charles ride their bikes up to his house: 
JOE I'll get the camera back, I know where my dad put it -- We can still make the festival. 
CHARLES It's not about the movie. 
JOE Then what is it about? 
CHARLES Jesus, you don't even get it do you? It's obvious. 
JOE What's obvious? 
CHARLES Gawd, you're a dumb ass. 
Frustrated beyond belief, Charles goes inside. Joe follows. 
INT. CHARLES' ROOM - DAY 
Charles threads the film into the projector. 
CHARLES That night of the crash, you started getting all weird. 
JOE -- what? 
CHARLES Like Mr. Attitude all of a sudden. 
JOE Your movie was over! That's what you said! You were upset. I gave you a camera! I helped you! 
CHARLES Don't pretend like you did it for me! You didn't do it for me and you know it! 
JOE What's your problem? 
Charles ROLLS THE FILM, DIMS THE LIGHTS -- 
CHARLES It was never about me! It was always about Alice! 
And suddenly on the poster board pinned to the closet, there she is: ALICE, from the night of the train crash. The scene plays as they filmed it: 
MRS. HATHAWAY John. I don't like it. This case. These murders. 
DETECTIVE HATHAWAY What am I supposed to do, go to Michigan with you? 
THE FILMED SCENE CONTINUES as Joe and Charles argue: 
JOE Well, you're the one who wanted the wife in the movie! 
CHARLES Not so you could fall in love with her! 
Joe's mind spins -- how does he respond to this?! 
JOE What do you even care what I think about Alice?! 
CHARLES Because I like her! That's why! That's why I asked her in the first place! So I could get to know her, not YOU! 
JOE -- wait, you like Alice Dainard? 
CHARLES You're such an idiot. 
JOE (from Charles' movie) Guys, look out! 
They watch for a moment as the TRAIN CRASH HAPPENS -- but it's SO SUDDEN, SO FAST, the camera picks up almost nothing. Within a moment, the camera is on its side, filming the SETTLING DEBRIS. Charles moves forward, so the film is now partially BEING PROJECTED ON HIM. 
CHARLES SHIT! Look at all that smoke! We can't use any of this. And you won't even let me blow up your train. Everything's bogus. 
JOE We can make another train and blow that one up. 
Joe moves forward. Part of the film PROJECTED ON HIM, too. 
JOE (CONT'D) I do like her. Sorry about that. 
CJAR Shut up. It's okay. (BEAT) That's not even what bothers me. (beat, finally, sad) It's that she likes you too. That really bothers me. I dunno... 
But Joe has seen something -- on the screen -- SOTTO: 
LOUIS It took her. I saw it. It was... something... so... big, like nothing -- it was-- and no one... no one believes me... (CRYING) ... no one believes me-- they just keep giving me pills. It took her... Joe, it took Alice... no one believes me. 
Joe's mind is on fire as he absorbs this -- HE WHISPERS: 
JOE ... I believe you. 
And Louis looks at him with hope -- 
JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D) It took Alice. 
CUT TO JOE WITH HIS FRIENDS, assembled around a set of cots. 
CHARLES CARY That thing took her--?! -- are you shitting me? 
JOE (CONT'D) Guys, WE HAVE TO GO BACK. 
They look at him like he's from Uranus. 
CHARLES PRESTON Back where? To do what? 
JOE (CONT'D) Back to town -- to find Alice -- we have to find her-- 
MARTIN JOE She's dead, if it took her, she-- -- don't say that! 
PRESTON Wait a minute -- first of all, I want to live. Okay? 
JOE I'm going whether you come or not-- which I really hope you do. 
CARY (pats his backpack) I've got six tons of explosives in here, let's find that thing and blow it to shit. 
INT. GREENVILLE AIR FORCE BASE HANGAR - DAY 
Jen, Charles' hot sister, lies on her cot making her Columbia House Records choices. Charles is in her face. 
JEN As if I'm gonna help you. 
CHARLES Do this for me and I'll babysit the twins next week so you can go to Wendy's stupid party. 
Jen suddenly closes her magazine, stares at him suspiciously. 
CHARLES (CONT'D) I am not shitting you. You can't ask me any questions though. You can't tell anyone. I'm serious. No one. 
JEN ... does it have to be him? 
CHARLES Yes or no, you ugly freak. I'm about to rescind the offer. 
INT. GREENVILLE AIR FORCE BASE HANGAR - DAY 
Jen looks RIGHT AS US, vulnerable, but seductive: 
JEN This whole evacuation thing's freaking me out. Making me rethink my priorities. Saw you over here and thought maybe we could kick back. 
Now we see Donny, looking RIGHT AT US. Utterly stunned. 
DONNY -- we totally could. 
JEN I asked Charles about you, and he said you're a great guy-- 
DONNY I totally am. 
JEN Will you hate me if I start our relationship by asking a favor? 
EXT. GREENVILLE AIR FORCE BASE HANGAR - DAY 
MOVING PAST as Donny moves through PARKED CARS, Joe, Charles, Cary and Martin keeping up: 
DONNY So there are rules to being in my car, okay? 
CARY Where the hell are we going anyway? 
JOE We're going to the school to open the trailer Woodward had in the parking lot. I bet that's where he keeps his research. 
The boys duck as SOLDIERS pass by. 
CARY What research? 
JOE We're gonna learn everything we can about that thing so we can find it. And that's how we're gonna save Alice. 
DONNY Dorks: no shoes on the upholstery and no one touches the CB, gottit? 
CHARLES You think Woodward's got information about that thing in the dungeon? 
A SHOT of the boys CLIMBING A FENCE. 
They move fast across the alley, to a TRAILER locked with A PADLOCK -- the DUNGEON. 
Joe tries PRYING the locks off with the tire iron -- it doesn't budge. 
CHARLES Joe, let me try -- let me try. 
Joe hands the tire iron to Charles -- he tries -- nothing. 
As Martin grabs the tire iron: 
CHARLES (CONT'D) Joe, this is impossible, man. 
Martin breaks off the LATCH -- BAM! 
CHARLES (CONT'D) --I loosened it for you. 
Now we CUT TO DARKNESS -- we're INSIDE THE DUNGEON as it opens -- the boys look DIRECTLY AT US -- their faces say it all: THE MOTHER LODE. 
JOE GUYS-- 
MARTIN CHARLES Look at all this junk. He's got movies in here. 
INT. MIDDLE SCHOOL HALL - DUSK 
The boys -- with FLASHLIGHTS -- turn a corner -- hurry down the hall -- 
CHARLES I cannot believe we're breaking into school, who does that? No one does that-- idiots do that-- 
The boys BREAK A CLASSROOM DOOR WINDOW and enter. 
INT. CLASSROOM - NIGHT - LATER 
We're looking down at the boys, SURROUNDED by hundreds of documents, boxes, photographs, 16MM film cannisters and cassette tapes. Charles threads the film. 
JOE Dr. Woodward was dishonorably discharged from Nellis Air Base in 1963 because of "subversive conduct," whatever that is. 
Joe holds up a 20-year-old PHOTO of MEN IN A LAB. Among them is 50-year-old WOODWARD: 
MARIN Dude, check it out. Old Man Woodward. 
CHARLES Back when he was like Middle-Aged Man Woodward. 
MARTIN -- He's been tracking this thing since like 1958. 
JOE (to the movie) What is this? 
CHARLES I don't know. It says April 8th, 1963 incident. I dunno. 
JOE Cary, we got to find this thing. 
CARY Sorry. 
Cary puts a CASSETTE into a tape deck, hits PLAY: 
DR. WOODWARD (V.O.) JOE -- I told them this creature is more sophisticated than any of us. That his species -- that's him -- IS PREDOMINANTLY subterranean. He's being -- subterranean -- treated without compassion or respect.... 
VARIOUS SHOTS of PHOTOGRAPHS AND DOCUMENTS: "UFO CRASH," "MAJOR NELEC IN CHARGE OF OPERATIONS," "TWO ALIEN BODIES, ONE LIVING," "RESTRAINTS USED," "EXPERIMENTS CONDUCTED" -- as Charles threads a FILM: 
The FILM: an AIR FORCE LOGO pops on and off. We see inside a HANGAR, where dozens of SCIENTISTS examine LARGE, BUS-SIZED pieces of jagged and unearthly material. All the while: 
DR. WOODWARD (V.O.) -- I explained that all he wants is to rebuild his ship. (MORE) DR. WOODWARD (V.O.) (CONT'D) A craft made up of those cubes of a complex, shape-shifting element-- remarkable material that we'll never fully understand. He has been desperate to reconstitute his ship since it crashed here in `58, but instead of giving him the help he needs, we've held him as a prisoner. He's been restrained and experimented upon -- Through pain and lack of compassion, we have taught him to hate us all. We've turned him into an enemy. 
Scientist explaining something to a group of SENIOR OFFICERS. Among them, a 32-year-old NELEC. 
Film JUMP CUTS to a HUGE REINFORCED LAB CAGE. Inside, sitting almost in a ball, IS THE MASSIVE CREATURE. Hard to see here. Another JUMP CUT as a SOLDIER offers a bucket of FOOD to the alien -- IT'S WOODWARD. 
CARY Guys, it's Dr. Woodward. Look. 
Woodward offers what looks like RAW MEAT to the motionless, sitting CREATURE. All the boys watch quietly -- then, suddenly, in milliseconds, the creature is UP, GRABBING WOODWARD THROUGH THE BARS -- the boys JUMP -- 
CHARLES MARTIN Arh! I can't watch that! 
DR. WOODWARD (V.O.) I told them I knew these things because he made contact with me. That he makes a psychic connection by touch. The moment we made contact, I understood him and he, me. What I know is that if we don't change this and start helping him, we will all pay the price. But Nelec won't listen-- 
The boys are SCARED as they watch the creature HOLD WOODWARD TIGHT -- LIFT HIM -- and its TENTACLES suddenly THRUST into his NOSE, EARS and MOUTH -- 
Joe stands and looks intently at the screen. 
JOE Woodward wasn't trying to kill it. 
CHARLES ... you gonna be okay without me? 
JOE (a meaningful beat) ... yeah. 
Charles nods -- Joe looks to Cary: 
CARY I'm not staying with the girls! 
CHARLES God, Cary. Shut up! 
CARY Calm down. 
MARTIN Oh, my leg hurts! 
JOE Come on, Cary, we gotta go. 
Joe nods, determined, and he and Cary head off -- 
CHARLES This is going to hurt. 
Martin screams. 
CHARLES (CONT'D) I haven't even done it yet. 
Joe and Cary run through the semi-demolished neighborhood, many houses shattered, some cars obliterated. The only lone figures in town. 
EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT 
Joe and Cary stop, out of breath, at the graves. 
CARY So what are we doing here? 
JOE Just follow me. 
CARY I've been following you for the last five blocks. What are we doing here? 
Joe and Cary run through the graveyard and over to the CARETAKER'S SHED. 
EXT./INT. CEMETERY CARETAKER'S SHED - NIGHT 
They're out of breath -- they try ONE garage door, windows CAKED WITH DIRT. Stuck. The SECOND door. Dirt-caked windows. Stuck. The third is a barn door -- they try it: locked. 
JOE Help me! 
CARY Help you with what? 
JOE We need to get inside. 
CARY For what? What's in these windows? 
JOE Cary, help me. 
CARY It's dirt. Why is there dirt in these windows? 
JOE Help me, on three. 
JOE/CARY One, two, three.... One, two, three.... One, two threee. 
The two begin KICKING the door together -- on three -- one -- two -- CRASH! Again and again, until finally the door KICKS OPEN -- and they almost FALL INSIDE -- and thank goodness they didn't -- because -- and now we're looking STRAIGHT DOWN FROM INSIDE THE SHED -- the entire floor of the shed has been DUG OUT -- DROPPING FORTY FEET STRAIGHT DOWN, dirt PILED, caked along the sides of the structure. The boys catch their breath. 
CARY Whoa. This is scary. 
JOE You got any sparklers in there? 
CARY Are you kidding me? 
Cary opens his backpack, whips out a Fourth of July SPARKLER. LIGHTS it with a lighter and DROPS IT IN. The thing falls far enough to tell them it's too far to jump. 
But burning on the dirt floor of the nearly-dug hole, it lights up a TUNNEL at the bottom. 
JOE -- Alice is down there. 
EXT. ROAD - NIGHT 
A JEEP roars past. 
INT. JEEP - NIGHT 
Jack drives fast. Louis sits beside him. It's awkward. But not angry. Finally, vulnerable, scared and sad: 
LOUIS I came to your house that day. To tell you that I never meant to hurt anyone. Swear to God. (beat, respectful tears) I'm sorry, Jack. About what happened to your wife. 
Cary's done laying out the charges -- he pulls out his lighter -- FFFT! FFFT! The damn thing won't light -- 
CARY -- come on-- damnit! 
FFT! FFT! No go -- he keeps trying. 
INT. TUNNEL #4 - NIGHT 
Joe watches as the creature FINISHES WITH ITS MEAL AND HEADS FOR THE OTHER HANGING BODIES -- PUSH IN ON JOE, DESPERATE -- 
JOE -- Cary, come on, come on-- 
INT. TUNNEL #2 - NIGHT 
Cary frantically trying the lighter -- FFT! FFT! FFT! 
CARY -- damnit!!! 
He looks up -- watches the creature GRAB AND PULL ALICE'S LIFELESS BODY DOWN FROM HER HANGING POSITION -- it moves with her to where he was eating the teacher -- Cary SHAKES THE LIGHTER, STARTING TO CRY AND HE FLICKS IT AND FFFFFTH!!! IT LIGHTS! HE TOUCHES IT ON THE GUN POWDER AND RUNS OFF -- 
INT. MECHANICAL CONTRAPTION SPACE - NIGHT 
The creature PULLS AWAY the fibrous covering over Alice -- its TENTACLES SLITHER OUT. 
INT. TUNNEL #4 - NIGHT 
Watching this is horror, Joe's about to run in just as BABABABABABABABAM!!! The creature JERKS UP from its almost- meal of Alice, looks toward the EXPLOSIVE SOUNDS, then LEAVES HER, quickly moving for the tunnel -- 
INT. TUNNEL #2 - NIGHT 
The creature arrives in the SMOKE-FILLED TUNNEL, as the FIREWORKS FILL the tunnel with BRIGHT, MULTI-COLORED LIGHTS -- 
INT. MECHANICAL CONTRAPTION SPACE - NIGHT 
Joe SPRINTS in, gets to Alice -- lightly slaps her face -- 
JOE -- Alice, please -- please -- (nothing -- SLAP) Alice, wake up! 
Nothing -- so he fucking SLAPS HER FACE HARD and she suddenly INHALES SHARPLY, he eyes WIDE, terrified -- 
JOE (CONT'D) Alice! You're alive! Can you hear me? Are you okay?! 
She's CATCHING HER BREATH, nodding, looking at him, amazed -- 
ALICE What is this? What are you doing here?! 
JOE I'm just-- doing the best I can to save you. 
She GRABS HIM AND HUGS HIM TIGHT, teary and grateful -- during which -- quietly: 
ALICE How did you know? 
JOE Your dad. He told me. He was worried. And flipping out. 
ALICE Really? 
JOE -- we need to move-- 
But she breaks out of the hug and grabs his shirt, intense: 
TINA (O.S.) Excuse me? 
TINA, a 24-year-old , disoriented woman with curlers in her hair, wakes up. 
TINA (CONT'D) Where are we? 
INT. MECHANICAL CONTRAPTION SPACE - NIGHT 
Joe and Alice have helped down one FAMILIAR FACE: SHERIFF PRUITT. They're out of breath, but their survival instinct has kicked in: 
TINA I left my bag in my car. Then I went to my car to get my bag-- 
ALICE It's been experimented on for years. It's terrified and exhausted and hungry, it just wants to go home. When it touched me, I knew -- 
JOE Alice, help me get the sheriff down. 
TIME CUT: 
SHERIFF PRUITT Follow me. I can get us out of here. 
JOE Sheriff, we came that way.

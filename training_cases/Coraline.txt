WYBIE (suddenly worried) Uh... I'm not supposed to talk about it. 
Changing the subject, he lifts a gloved hand to shake. 
WYBIE (CONT'D) I'm Wybie, Wybie Lovat. 
CORALINE 
(SKEPTICAL) Wybie? 
WYBIE Short for Wyborne. Not my idea, of course. What'd you get saddled with? 
CORALINE I wasn't saddled with anything. It's Coraline. 
WYBIE Caroline what? 
CORALINE Coraline. Coraline Jones. 
WYBIE (confused, not hearing it) Hmmm... It's not real scientific, but I heard an ordinary name, like Caroline -- 
Her face goes as DARK as the rain clouds above. 
WYBIE (CONT'D) -- can lead people to have ordinary expectations about a person-- 
WYBIE'S GRANDMOTHER (O.C.) (calling from afar) Wyborne! 
CORALINE I think I heard someone calling you, Wyborne. 
WYBIE What? I didn't hear anything-- 
CORALINE Oh, I definitely heard someone, Why-were- you-born. 
A distant dinner bell clangs. 
WYBIE'S GRANDMOTHER (O.C.) Wyborne! 
WYBIE (under his breath, nervous) Grandma! 
He holds up his hands in surrender, nodding with eyes closed, forcing some laughs. 
WYBIE (CONT'D) Heh. Well, great to meet a Michigan water witch. 
He picks up his bike, wheels it around, then holds up his gloved hands. 
WYBIE (CONT'D) But I'd wear gloves next time. 
CORALINE 
(SKEPTICAL) Why? 
He points to her dowsing rod, nods. 
WYBIE (CONT'D) `Cause that dowsing rod of yours? Uh, it's poison oak. 
CORALINE Ehh!! 
Coraline drops the stick as he zooms away and wipes her hands on her clothes. 
The cat merows at her, shaking his head with a pitying look, then trots away after Wybie. She STICKS OUT HER TONGUE at him. 
She looks down at the COVERING to the well. Coraline finds a PEBBLE and drops it through A SMALL KNOT-HOLE. Ear at the knot-hole, she counts until there's a watery "plop" far below. FAT RAINDROPS start to fall around her. 
ROTATE DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. KITCHEN - NEXT MORNING 
It's POURING out. Coraline looks out a window at the DEAD- LOOKING GARDEN, and places PACKETS OF SEEDS - pumpkins, squash, snap dragons, bleeding hearts - on the sill. She's developed a REDDISH RASH - poison oak - on one hand. 
The main floor kitchen, like most   things in the Pink Palace, is barely maintained, and   looks worn and faded. Coraline's MOTHER, MEL JONES, 40,   bangs away at her laptop on the table, MOVING BOXES   stacked nearby. She's plain-looking and tired and wears   a NECK-BRACE. 
CORALINE I almost fell down a well yesterday, Mom. 
MEL (not listening) Uh huh. 
CORALINE I would have died. 
MEL (continues typing) That's nice. 
Coraline scratches the rash on her hand, changes subject. 
CORALINE Hmmm. So can I go out? I think it's perfect weather for gardening. 
MEL No, Coraline. Rain makes mud. Mud makes a mess. 
Coraline turns to her. 
CORALINE But Mom, I want stuff growing when my friends come to visit. Isn't that why we moved here? 
MEL Something like that. But then we had the accident. 
CORALINE Wasn't my fault you hit that truck. 
MEL I never said it was. 
CORALINE 
CORALINE (CONT'D) Ahh!! 
She shakes out her hair. 
HALLWAY NEAR STAIRS 
Coraline pounds down the stairs, spots the carpet bump again in the hallway and jumps on it. A closet door opens, a light on inside, and she goes to investigate. 
WATER HEATER CLOSET 
ANGLE OVER water heater on Coraline. She jots down one rusty water heater in her pad. As she leaves, she flicks off the light switch, not noticing a note taped beside it that says: Do not turn off! 
INT. STUDY - SAME 
Lights flicker and then Charlie's computer dies. He hollers. 
CHARLIE No, no, no, no, no; GAAAA--! 
INT. HALLWAY - SAME 
CHARLIE (O.S.) 
--AAAAAAA! 
Coraline reacts with guilty alarm, runs back to the closet and -- 
INT. CLOSET - SAME 
-- spots the Do not turn off note. She flips the light switch back on and gets out of there. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME 
The room is faded and cold with bare windows looking out on rain and gray. The floor is strewn with moving boxes, a few pieces of furniture, Charlie's old Nordic Track. A few garden tools lean against one wall; a cardboard mattress box leans against a corner wall. 
Coraline enters, counting windows and doors to note in her pad. She sets the doll on a low table beside an open moving box and smiles. 
The box is filled with her mom's collection of SNOWGLOBES. She takes out her favorite - the BEAR FOUNTAIN AT THE DETROIT ZOO - and shakes it. She studies the globe and sighs with homesickness. She sets it carefully on the FIREPLACE MANTEL, then unwraps the rest of the snowglobes and places them beside it. 
Over the mantel hangs a PAINTING of a CRYING BOY IN BLUE - a scoop of ice cream melting on his shirt, his hand holding an EMPTY CONE. Coraline takes up pad and pen and adds to her list, muttering aloud. 
CORALINE One boring blue boy in a painfully boring painting ... four incredibly boring windows ... and no... more... doors... 
She turns to grab the doll off the table by the snow globe box. It's gone. 
CORALINE (CONT'D) All right, little me, where are you hiding? 
Scanning the room, she spots the doll LOOKING OUT FROM BEHIND THE MATTRESS BOX leaned against the corner wall. Perplexed, she walks over and kneels down to grab the doll when she notices SOMETHING ON THE WALL behind the box. 
She shoves the box aside, and discovers the outline of a SMALL DOOR that's been wallpapered over. 
CORALINE (CONT'D) Huh? 
Intensely curious, she calls to the kitchen. 
CORALINE (CONT'D) Hey Mom... 
INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 
Mom, typing away, ignores her. 
CORALINE (O.S.) Where does this door go? 
MEL I'm really, really busy! 
INT LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Coraline tries to open it but there's no handle. 
CORALINE I think it's locked. 
MEL (O.S.) 
INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 
CORALINE (O.S.) Pleeeeeeeeease! 
Mel gets up, really annoyed. Big sigh. 
MEL Uhhh... 
INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME 
She walks over to Coraline, looks at the outline of the door in the ratty old wallpaper. 
MEL Will you stop pestering me if I do this for you? 
Coraline nods her head quickly, PANTING like a dog. 
MEL (CONT'D) Fine. 
She heads back to the kitchen. 
INT KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 
Mel pulls open a drawer, pushes a bunch of loose brass and nickel keys aside to find a small, sharp black key. Holds it up. 
THROUGH. 
INT. PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS 
Coraline MOVES FORWARD, towards the light ahead. 
INT. OTHER LIVING ROOM ­ CONTINUOUS 
Coraline steps out through the same little door, into what looks like the EXACT SAME LIVING ROOM she just left, only something is different -- it feels deeper, more dimensional. 
CORALINE Huh? 
She looks around, notices the painting over the fireplace: the crying blue boy is now SMILING, his shirt clean and his ice cream back on his cone. 
From across the hall, warm light comes from the kitchen and the smell of delicious food wafts towards her nose. 
CORALINE (CONT'D) MMMMM, something smells good. 
INT. OTHER KITCHEN - NIGHT 
Coraline enters to see her mother cooking at the stove, wearing an apron and ROOSTER-HEAD OVEN MITTS. The light and colors are much warmer and the details more perfect in this kitchen. Other Mother is facing away from Coraline as she works. 
CORALINE Mom?! What are you doing here in the middle of the night? 
Her mother turns from the stove to greet her and Coraline is DUMBSTRUCK: she's got BUTTONS FOR EYES! She beams with happiness at Coraline's arrival. 
OTHER MOTHER You're just in time for supper, dear! 
CORALINE You're not my mother. 
CORALINE (CONT'D) My mother doesn't have b-b-buh... 
Coraline points to her own eye. 
OTHER MOTHER B-b-b-buttons? Do you like them? 
She taps one with her nail. 
OTHER MOTHER (CONT'D) I'm your Other Mother, silly. Now go tell your Other Father that supper's ready. 
She opens the oven door and the intoxicating perfume of great cooking fills the air. Coraline breathes it in, suddenly VERY HUNGRY. 
OTHER MOTHER (CONT'D) Well, go on. He's in his study. 
INT. OTHER HALLWAY - SAME 
Coraline goes down the hall and opens the study door. 
INT. OTHER STUDY - CONTINUOUS 
She sees the back of a man like her father, only with more hair. Instead of tapping away at his computer, though, he's picking notes on a BABY GRAND PIANO. 
CORALINE Hello? 
He turns around. He, too, has SHINY BUTTON EYES. He seems happier and a little more handsome than real Dad, and wears an IRIDESCENT ROBE over POLKA DOT PAJAMAS, with ORANGE MONKEY SLIPPERS on his feet. He smiles broadly. 
OTHER FATHER Hello, Coraline. Want to hear my new song? 
CORALINE My father can't play piano. 
OTHER FATHER No need to ... this piano plays ME! 
DR. SEUSS GLOVES ­ connected with rods and pulleys ­ POP OUT of the piano's front and ONTO HIS HANDS. His hands RAISE UP ­ then DROP DOWN to play pounding STRIDE PIANO as Other Father SINGS out. 
OTHER FATHER (CONT'D) Making up a song about Coraline. She's a peach, she's a doll, she's a pal of mine. She's as cute as a button in the eyes of everyone who ever laid their eyes on Cor- a-line. 
Coraline is amazed as his hands fly. 
OTHER FATHER (CONT'D) When she comes around exploring Mom and I will never ever make it boring our eyes will be on Coraline. 
Anxious, she taps his shoulder to stop him. 
CORALINE I, uh ­ sorry ­ but she said to tell you the food's ready. 
OTHER FATHER Mmmmm! Who's starving? Raise your hand. 
He sticks his hand up, still in a glove, and his other gloved hand slaps his face. She LAUGHS, then covers her mouth. 
INT. OTHER DINING ROOM - SAME 
Other Mother sets down a HUGE, ROASTED CHICKEN near Coraline on a table spread with CANDLES, fine CHINA and SILVER and a PINEAPPLE CENTERPIECE. FIGURE EIGHT MODEL TRAIN TRACKS circle twin LAZY SUSANS covered in dishes of POTATOES, SWEET PEAS, ROLLS, and CORN. The Other Father seals this Norman Rockwell moment by making PRAYER HANDS and a solemn face. 
OTHER FATHER We give our thanks and ask to bless, Our Mother's golden chicken breast! 
He laughs with glee then a STARTING BELL rings and it's time to eat. Other Father really digs in while Coraline tries some chicken. 
CORALINE Mmmm, this chicken is good. 
OTHER MOTHER Hungry, aren't you. 
CORALINE (nodding, mouth full) D'you have any gravy? 
OTHER MOTHER Well, here comes the gravy train! Choo- choo! 
Other Mother GIGGLES as a MODEL TRAIN circles round the track, pulling a GRAVY BOAT CAR and blowing its whistle. The train goes in one side of the centerpiece and comes out the other, slowing till the gravy boat lines up with Coraline's plate, where it POURS GRAVY on her potatoes. 
CORALINE Hello. 
The TURTLE SHELL she'd found CIRCLES HER FEET on clothes pin legs, making PANTING SOUNDS. She laughs, then hears two voices from beside her bed. 
PHOTO FRIEND 1 (O.C.) 
(MICHIGAN-SPEAK) Hey, how zit goin', yuper! 
PHOTO FRIEND 2 (O.C.) 
(MICHIGAN-SPEAK) Where's your swampers and tuke? 
She jumps onto the bed, grabs the photo of her best friends from home, now ALIVE IN THE PHOTO. 
CORALINE Kripes a-mighty, how are my best trolls? I can't wait till summer. You're both comin', right? 
PHOTO FRIEND 1 We're already here, Coraline -- 
PHOTO FRIEND 2 
-- gone to Or-e-gine! 
Coraline grins hugely, then, exhausted, she yawns, stretching out her arms. 
The Other Mother, in the bedside chair, takes her hand and applies some SOOTHING BLACK MUD to Coraline's poison oak rash. 
CORALINE Oh, the mud... 
The Other Mother gently tucks her in then she and the Other Father smile at Coraline as she drifts off to sleep. 
OTHER MOTHER                  OTHER FATHER See you soon ...              See you soon ... 
PULL BACK MATCH 
DISSOLVE: 
INT. CORALINE'S REAL BEDROOM - MORNING 
Coraline awakens. She looks around expecting bright colors, a magic dragonfly. But it's just her NORMAL ROOM: moving boxes; cracks in the ceiling -- nothing's changed. 
She notices the BUTTON-EYED DOLL on the chair where she left it, where the Other Mother was sitting. She picks it up, absentmindedly goes to scratch her wrist. She stops, noticing that the rash on her wrist IS GONE. 
CORALINE 
(GASPING) It's gone, my poison oak, it's gone!... 
INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME 
Coraline goes to the little door, still ajar. She peeks behind and finds the WALL OF SOLID BRICKS. Yes, it was only a dream. 
CORALINE 
(SOFTLY) Huh? 
She shakes her head and pushes the door shut. The kettle blows from the kitchen. 
KITCHEN - DAY, GROUND FOG OUT WINDOWS 
Breakfast. Mel and Charlie finish their "Go Lean Breakfast Twigs" and mugs of instant coffee. Preoccupied with their work, they half-listen as Coraline recounts her dream, her breakfast untouched. FOG lies outside the windows. 
CORALINE It was incredibly real, Mom! Only you weren't really you; you were my other mother. 
MEL 
(DISAPPROVING) Buttons for eyes, huh? (indicates untouched food) Coraline, you only dreamed you ate all that chicken. Take your multi-vitamin, at least. 
CORALINE You were in the dream too, Dad. You had wild-looking pajamas and orange monkey slippers. 
CHARLIE (pretend offense) Orange? My monkey slippers are blue. 
He stands, put his dishes in the sink. Whispers over his 
SHOULDER: 
CHARLIE (CONT'D) 
(OPTIONAL) Pssst. Can you get me some of that magic mud you were talking about? 
She points to her rash-free wrists. He nods. 
CHARLIE (CONT'D) Because I have a terrible case of writer's rash. On my---. 
Mel CLEARS HER THROAT, interrupting. 
MEL If the real Charlie Jones wants his pages edited, he'd better wrap them up ASAP. 
He crisply salutes her, turns on his heel, and marches out the door. Mel gets up to clear the table with Coraline. 
MEL (CONT'D) Coraline, why don't you go visit downstairs? I bet those "actresses" would love to hear your dream. 
CORALINE Miss Spink and Forcible? But you said they're dingbats. 
MEL 
(NODS) Uh huh. 
CORALINE No!!! 
Bobinsky LEAPS all the way to the ground, landing beside her, out of breath. 
MR. BOBINSKY The mice...asked me to give you message. 
CORALINE The...jumping mice? 
Mr. B nods gravely. He leans down, so close his moustache touches her ear, and whispers, his voice DEAD-SERIOUS. 
MR. BOBINSKY They are saying: do not go through leetle door. Do you know such a thing? 
Coraline is startled. 
CORALINE The one behind the wall paper? But... it's all bricked up. 
The old man shrugs, straightens. 
MR. BOBINSKY Bah. So sorry, is nothing. Sometimes the mice are leetle... 
He points to his head and rotates his finger. 
MR. BOBINSKY (CONT'D) ...mixed up, hmmm? They even get your name wrong, you know. They call you Coraline instead of Caroline, not Caroline at all. 
He starts back up the stairs. 
MR. BOBINSKY (CONT'D) Maybe I work them too hard... 
Coraline stares after him. 
EXT. HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER 
SHEARS IN HAND, Coraline approaches the family VW, where one PINK SUITCASE remains tied to the roof. She snips it free and takes out her special HAT, a black Japanese schoolboy's cap. 
EXT. HOUSE, STAIRWELL DOWNSTAIRS FLAT ­ SAME 
Coraline climbs down the steps to the basement flat. At the door, she tries the comedy/tragedy door knocker and waits. Nothing. She glances down at the doormat - it reads "No whistling in the house." 
She peers through the door glass. A YAPPING DOG suddenly LEAPS UP inside, startling her, and a moment after, MISS SPINK ­ wearing some sort of house robe ­ opens the door and three SCOTTIE DOGS ­ HAMISH, JOCK, AND ANGUS ­ shoot out and surround Coraline. Spink tries to quiet them down. 
MISS SPINK 
(HARSH) Oh cease your infernal yapping! (to Coraline, sweetly) How nice to see you, Caroline. Would you like to come in? We're playing cards. 
CORALINE Still Coraline, Miss Spink. 
MISS SPINK (over shoulder) Miriam, put the kettle on! 
INT. MISSES SPINK & FORCIBLE'S FLAT - SAME 
Miss Spink leads Coraline into the living area, as MISS FORCIBLE, taller and sporting a platinum wig and a very large bosom, prepares tea in the kitchen to the side. The dogs race ahead and jump onto the sofa. Coraline scans the walls to see framed POSTERS from the "Shakespeare" the ladies used to perform like King Leer and Julius Seize Her. Miss Forcible peers out her, half-blind without her glasses. 
MISS FORCIBLE April, I think you're being followed. 
MISS SPINK It's the new neighbor, Miriam - Caroline? She'll be having the Oolong tea. 
MISS FORCIBLE No, no, no, no. I'm sure she'd prefer Jasmine. 
MISS SPINK No, Oolong. 
MISS FORCIBLE Ah, Jasmine it is, then. 
Forcible grabs a handful of tea, puts it in the pot and pours boiling water in. 
MISS SPINK Come on, boys! 
The dogs leap off the sofa and, as Coraline takes their place, she looks to the side and sees a towering bookcase filled with STUFFED SCOTTY DOGS IN KNITTED SWEATERS WITH 
ANGEL WINGS. 
CORALINE 
(ALARMED) Are those dogs .... real? 
MISS SPINK 
(SIGHS) Our sweet, departed angels. Couldn't bear to part with them ... so we had them stuffed. 
(CONTINUES) 
(MORE) 
MISS SPINK (CONT'D) Now, there's Hamish the third, the fourth, the eighth, the ninth. Angus the second, the fifth, the.. 
Miss Forcible arrives with a tea tray and urges Coraline to take a candy as Spink goes on and on. 
MISS FORCIBLE Oh go on, have one ­ it's hand-pulled taffy from Brighton ­ best in the world. 
Coraline reaches for a pink and green one. But the taffy is so old and sticky, her fingers get stuck. Then her other hand gets stuck, trying to get the first hand out. 
MISS SPINK (O.C.) ...seventh, the third, the ninth, yes, the fourthI'm right; and Jock Junior, Jock senior, Jock the third, the fourth... 
Coraline, using her feet, finally un-sticks the candy bowl which FLIES UP and sticks to the ceiling. 
MISS SPINK (CONT'D) ...oh, and that's Jock's 2nd cousin, twice removed. 
CORALINE What d'ya mean, "we?" 
There's a soft meowing from under his coat. He opens it up and the BLACK CAT EMERGES and climbs onto his shoulders. 
CORALINE (CONT'D) Ha! Your cat's not wild, he's a wuss- puss! 
Cat glares at her angrily. 
WYBIE What? He hates to get his feet wet. Geez. 
CORALINE 
(MOCKING) Wuss-puss... 
Tired of her company, the cat jumps off Wybie, onto a tree and up onto the roof of the house. Coraline softens. 
CORALINE (CONT'D) So... that doll. Did you make it look like me? 
Wybie, scanning under the ground fog for slugs, sticks his head up for a moment. 
WYBIE Oh no; I found it that way. It's older than Gramma -- old as this house prob'ly. 
Coraline is highly skeptical. Wybie returns to his hunt. 
CORALINE (points to self) C'mom - blue hair, my swampers and raincoat? 
Wybie stands excitedly and presents a HUGE YELLOW-GREEN SLUG to Coraline. 
WYBIE Dang, check out Slugzilla! 
She's not impressed. 
CORALINE 
(FRUSTRATED) You're just like them. 
WYBIE Huh? 
He looks from the slug to himself. 
CORALINE I meant my parents; they don't listen to me either. 
Wybie nods, not listening again, takes his camera -- 
WYBIE Uh huh... You mind? 
-- hands it to her. She acts put-out, but frames a shot. He signals he's ready and she fires off one auto-flash shot after another as he strikes silly poses making SOUND EFFECTS: horrified of the slug one moment; ready to eat it the next; pretending it's something from his nose in another. She can't help but GIGGLE. 
CORALINE Ew! 
Finished, Wybie tosses the slug back into the fog, and takes the camera back. He lowers his head, thoughtful, then glances up past Coraline at the house. He SIGHS and speaks in a SAD TONE. 
WYBIE You know, I've never been inside the Pink Palace. 
CORALINE 
(SCEPTICAL) You're kidding. 
WYBIE Grandma would kill me. Thinks it's dangerous or something. 
CORALINE Dangerous? 
WYBIE Well... she had a twin sister. 
CORALINE So? 
WYBIE (O.C.). When they were kids, Grandma's sister disappeared. 
(ON CAMERA) She says she was stolen. 
CORALINE (O.S.) 
(SKEPTICAL) Stolen? 
ANGLE from roof, over CAT'S SHOULDER as dialog continues. Cat senses something and turns -- it's Coraline's DOLL AT THE WINDOW, looking like it's spying on things. 
CORALINE(CONT'D) Well, what do you think? 
WYBIE Uhhh, I-I don't know. 
BACK TO KIDS. Wybie, astride his electric bike now, WHISTLES and the black cat jumps down from the roof, onto his shoulders. 
WYBIE (CONT'D) Maybe she just ran away? 
We hear Wybie's agitated grandmother call out. 
WYBIE'S GRANDMOTHER (O.C.) Wyborne! 
Wybie turns away: he's said too much. 
WYBIE Look, I gotta go. 
He starts to pull away. 
CORALINE Wait a minute! 
STREAMS OF WATER. 
Arriving beside Coraline, he waggles his finger at the naughty snapdragons. 
OTHER FATHER (CONT'D) Tickle no more, you dragon snappers! 
Then he deftly cuts a bouquet of them and presents it to Coraline. She nods thanks. 
CORALINE Well, she says it's time for dinner ... breakfast ... food? 
OTHER FATHER Hop on, kiddo, I want to show you something! 
She does. The Other Father grabs the GEARSHIFT KNOB, pulls it, and the mechanical mantis SPROUTS WINGS. They RISE in the air. Looking down, she sees that the garden is a PORTRAIT OF CORALINE. 
CORALINE I can't believe you did this! 
OTHER FATHER Mother said you'd like it! Boy she knows you like the back of her hand. 
He pulls a lever and they ZOOM out of frame. 
INT. OTHER KITCHEN - SAME 
Coraline doesn't hold back this time. She stacks sausages on eggs on top of waffles, rolls it up and stuffs it in her mouth. The Other Mother FEEDS BITS OF SAUSAGE to the HUNGRY SNAPDRAGONS bouquet now in a vase. 
CORALINE Mmmm...so good! 
OTHER FATHER I love dinner, breakfast food. 
OTHER MOTHER Coraline, Mr. Bobinsky has invited you to come see the Jumping Mice perform after dinner. 
CORALINE Really. That know-it-all Wybie said it was all in Mr. B's head, I knew he was wrong. 
OTHER FATHER Well, everything's right in this world, Kiddo. 
Coraline hurries to shovel in the rest of her meal, while her Other Parents smile at one another. 
OTHER MOTHER Your father and I will clean up while you and your friend head upstairs. 
CORALINE My friend? 
There's a KNOCK at the door. Other Mother opens it to reveal the OTHER WYBIE. He's cleaner, with better posture, and cute button eyes. 
CORALINE (CONT'D) Great... another Wybie. Hello, Why-were- you-born. 
The boy nods, button eyes shining. 
CORALINE (CONT'D) Hello? 
He just makes a shy smile, doesn't answer. She's confused. 
OTHER MOTHER I thought you'd like him more, if he spoke a little less. (shrugs, smiling) So I fixed him. 
CORALINE So he can't talk at all? 
OTHER MOTHER Nope. 
She looks Other Wybie over appreciatively. 
CORALINE Hmm, I like it. 
OTHER MOTHER 
(PROUDLY) Now run along, you two, and have fun. 
Coraline heads out the door with the mute boy. 
EXT. OTHER ESTATE HOUSE - SAME 
The Other House ­ lit by amber spotlights looks MAGICAL with ornate GINGERBREAD TRIM; glowing TOPIARY in the yard. The kids come out the front door. 
CORALINE You're awful cheerful, considering you can't say anything. 
Other Wybie nods in agreement. Coraline and he start up the stairs to Bobinsky's. 
CORALINE (CONT'D) Uh...It didn't hurt, did it, when she... 
She points to her mouth. There's an awkward moment and then he points past her, excitedly: a SMALL BLIMP is flying towards Bobinsky's door. 
They run up the stairs and watch it slip through an opening above his door. Coraline knocks and the door suddenly SPINS, THROWING THEM INSIDE. 
INT. OTHER MR. BOBINSKY'S FLAT - SAME 
They somersault to a stop and sit up. Down two rows of SMALL CANNONS that face each, an amazing MINIATURE CIRCUS has been set up, with a FERRIS WHEEL beside it. 
CORALINE Whoa... cool! 
Coraline goes right to the Ferris wheel where a MECHANICAL CHICKEN eats dried corn on the cob, fires up its belly, then POOPS OUT POPCORN into paper bags. 
Other Wybie stomps a firing button and COTTON CANDY shoots out of a cannon. He catches the cone, then starts firing off all the cannons. Coraline looks back to find him covered in the cotton candy. 
CORALINE (CONT'D) Look at you! 
Spotlights come on in the big top, the entrance opens, and a big voice is heard over loudspeakers. 
OTHER MR. BOBINSKY (O.S.) Lady and gentleman! For to tickle your eyes and ears and making hearts to thump, I ­ Sergei Alexander Bobinsky ­ am introducing... 
She makes the hand-thumb bottle sign. Charlie leans in to Coraline, pinches her nose. 
CHARLIE Well, I guess I'll see you around, you dizzy dreamer. 
Coraline cuts him off, embarrassed. 
CORALINE Da-ad! I'm not five anymore. 
Dad sighs, heads up the steps to his appointment as Mel and Coraline drive off. 
INT. UNIFORMS DEPARTMENT STORE - SAME 
PRESIDENT'S DAY SALE. Mel piles gray blouses, a navy skirt, white socks onto the arms of a CLERK. 
Sitting alone on some stairs, Coraline sees a pair of fancy GREEN AND ORANGE GLOVES. 
As she tries them on, a YOUNG RASCAL in costume with sword BOUNCES PAST her down the stairs on a WHEELED STEP STOOL - his FATHER in pursuit. 
YOUNG RASCAL My kingdom for a hooooooorse!!!! 
There's an off screen crash, then the step stool rolls back to Coraline. She gets an idea. 
Mel is checking out school blouses, when Coraline rolls past, first one direction, then the other, modeling the colorful gloves. Without looking up, her mom tells her: 
MEL Put them back. 
CORALINE But Mom, the whole school's gonna wear boring gray clothes. No one will have these. 
MEL Put them back. 
Coraline mutters: 
CORALINE My other mother would get them. 
MEL Maybe she should buy all your clothes. 
Coraline scowls and stomps away to return the gloves. 
INT. CAR - SAME 
Coraline and Mel are driving home, shopping bags in back. 
CORALINE So what do you think's in the other apartment? 
MEL I don't know. Not a family of Jones imposters. 
CORALINE Then why'd you lock the door? 
MEL (shorter than previous) Oh, I found some rat crap and... I thought you'd feel ... safer. 
CORALINE They're jumping-mice, Mom! And the dreams aren't dangerous; they're the most fun I've had since we've moved here. 
MEL Your school might be fun. 
CORALINE With those stupid uniforms?   Right. 
MEL Had to give it a try. 
They pull into their DRIVEWAY. 
INT. KITCHEN - SAME 
Mel pulls out salsa, mustard, catsup, stale tortillas from the fridge. 
MEL How do you feel about a mustard-ketchup- salsa wrap for lunch? 
Coraline, carrying in the bags from outside, makes a face. 
CORALINE Are you kidding me? 
MEL Mmm... Had to go food shopping anyway. Dad's planning something special. 
Coraline squinches up her nose. 
CORALINE Gross-gusting. 
MEL 
(BRIGHTENS ) You wanna come along? You can pick out something you like. 
Coraline plops down in a chair. 
CORALINE Oh, like the gloves? 
Mel reaches out and musses Coraline's hair. The girl pulls away. 
MEL Look, Coraline... if things go well today, I promise I'll make it up. 
CORALINE That's what you always say. 
Mom rolls her eyes, shaking her head, and opens the door to leave. 
MEL Won't be long. 
Shuts the door. 
YOU'RE NOT SEWING BUTTONS IN MY EYES! 
OTHER MOTHER Oh, but we need a yes ... if you want to stay here. 
Other Father tests the needle on his finger. 
OTHER FATHER 
(ENTHUSIASTIC) So sharp you won't feel a thi-- Oww! 
Other Mother KICKS him under the table. Embarrassed, he puts the needle back in the box. 
OTHER MOTHER There now; it's your decision, darling. We only want what's best for you. 
She walks over and puts her hand, now ICY COLD, on Coraline's shoulder. Coraline PUSHES it away and STANDS 
UP. 
CORALINE I'm... I'm going to bed! RIGHT NOW! 
OTHER MOTHER 
(WOUNDED) Bed? 
OTHER FATHER Before dinner? 
Coraline fights to control her quaking voice. 
CORALINE I'm really, really tired. Yeah... (fakes huge yawn) I just need to sleep on things. 
Other Mother stands, masking disappointment. 
OTHER MOTHER Well of course you do, darling... I'll be happy to tuck you in. 
Coraline backs away, urging them to stay where they are. 
CORALINE (palms out, forced smile) Oh, no thanks, uh, you-you've done so much already-- 
She turns to leave and finds the Other Mother BLOCKING THE DOORWAY. Other Father joins her. 
OTHER MOTHER You're welcome. And I ­ (smiles to Other Father) we aren't worried at all, darling. 
(SOFTLY) Soon you'll see things our way. 
She lets go. She and the Other Father herd Coraline across the hallway to the stairs. 
INT. OTHER HALLWAY, STAIRS, UPPER HALL - CONTINUOUS 
Coraline carefully climbs the stairs, the Other Parents watching. When they can no longer see her, she RACES up the last steps and DASHES to her Other Bedroom. 
INT. CORALINE'S OTHER BEDROOM - TWILIGHT 
Coraline shuts the door and is quickly surrounded by fluttering DRAGONFLIES. 
MAGIC DRAGONFLY What's wrong, Coraline? Don't you want to play? 
She jumps up and CATCHES the paper creatures, opens the TOY CHEST and tosses them in. 
The PLUSH BLUE SQUID greets her from the shelf, followed by the TOY TANK GIRAFFE. 
TOY SQUID Yeah, I wanna hugga your face! 
TOY TANK GIRAFFE Get a grip, soldier. 
She GRABS them both and drops them in the toy chest. 
Her PHOTO FRIENDS - NOW WITH BLACK BUTTONS FOR EYES - call out from the photo by her bed. 
PHOTO FRIENDS Hey! 
PHOTO FRIEND 1 Where's yer buttons, yuper? 
PHOTO FRIEND 2 You wanna stay, don'tcha? 
Coraline grabs them as well, drops them in the chest, and SHUTS the lid. She barricades the door with a DRESSER and CHAIRS and then the TOY CHEST. 
CORALINE I'm going home tonight, robots - and I won't be back. 
She sits on the bed, pulls off the blue boots then CLIMBS UNDER THE COVERS, pulling them over her head and holding tight. She HUGS herself to stop shaking, knowing she must fall asleep in this bed to wake up in her real bed at home. She closes her eyes and tells herself: 
CORALINE (CONT'D) Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep! 
She tosses one way, then another. WE HEAR her voice 
CONTINUE: 
CORALINE (V.O.) (CONT'D) Go to sleep, go to sleep... 
There are strange, backwards sounds, then the eerie voices of Other Mother and Other Father. 
OTHER MOTHER (V.O.) There's just one tiny little thing we have to do. 
CORALINE Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep... 
OTHER FATHER (V.O.) So sharp you won't feel a thing... 
CAT (cont'd) She wants something to love, I think. Something that isn't her... Or maybe she'd just love something to eat. 
CORALINE Eat? That's ridiculous, mothers don't eat daughters! 
CAT I don't know. How do you taste? 
OTHER HOUSE REAPPEARS 
A SHAPE RISES in front of them in the whiteness and becomes the beautiful OTHER HOUSE. Coraline and the cat slow, then the front yard and topiary, the sky, hills, white gravel drive and the poplar trees behind them FILL 
IN. 
CORALINE Huh? But how can you walk away from something and still come back to it? 
The cat curls its tail into a question mark, and tips its head to one side. 
CAT Walk around the world. 
CORALINE Small world. 
Coraline shivers. The cat suddenly TENSES, focuses on a shrub. 
CAT Hang on-- 
He bounds towards the shrub and chases out a CUTE KANGAROO MOUSE in uniform with a TINY TRUMPET. Before Coraline can blink, he's PINNED IT DOWN. 
CORALINE Stop, he's one of the circus mice! 
With a SWIFT BLOW of its paw, the cat KNOCKS the mouse into the air, and catches it in his mouth. He gives a QUICK, KILLING BITE - CORALINE GASPS - and the mouse TRANSFORMS into a BIG DEAD RAT. Coraline is stunned. He drops the rat on the ground. 
CAT I don't like rats at the best of times, but this one was sounding an alarm. 
The cat picks the rat up and heads off. Slack-jawed, Coraline speaks with admiration. 
CORALINE Gooooood kitty. 
Coraline looks to the house with a determined look. 
On the porch, she takes out a HEAVY CANE from the UMBRELLA STAND and hits it into her hand. 
INT. HOUSE,   OTHER HALLWAY - SAME 
Coraline, standing in front of the living room doors, TESTS the cane in her hands, and peers down the hall for danger. It's dead quiet -- no piano, no sounds of anything. 
She JAMS the cane through the doors' handles, and PULLS with all her might. One HANDLE AND LOCK BREAK and the door swings open into the pitch black living room. The hall light casts a narrow path directly to the Other Little Door on the far wall, cracked open. She steps into the room. 
INT. OTHER LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
A huge ARMOIRE BUG suddenly crab-steps in her path, blocking the little door, and all around her things start to glow. The room has been TRANSFORMED into an amazing BUG MUSEUM, with all sorts of glowing, living specimens in the place of the old furniture and furnishings. The radiators are now big caterpillars, the Nordic Track a serving bug. 
The Other Mother speaks out, startling Coraline. 
OTHER MOTHER (O.S.) They say even the proudest -- 
The sofa, now a LARGE BUG, turns in place to reveal her sitting on it. 
OTHER MOTHER (CONT'D) --spirit can be broken ... with love. 
She's all smiles, button eyes shining, one hand held out in a behold my handiwork gesture. 
A BUG CHAIR scoops up Coraline and brings her to the Other Mother. 
The Other Mother takes a candy dish from the servant bug. 
OTHER MOTHER (CONT'D) Of course, chocolate never hurts. Like one? 
She extends a CANDY DISH filled LIVING CHOCOLATE BEETLES. 
OTHER MOTHER (CONT'D) They're Cocoa Beetles from Zanzibar. 
Coraline is disgusted. The Other Mother takes back the dish and BITES OFF THE HEAD OF ONE. It's the first thing she's eaten in the film. 
CORALINE I want to be with my real mom and dad. I want you to let me go. 
The Other Mother FROWNS, swallows. She speaks with a FRIGHTENING STEELINESS in her voice. 
OTHER MOTHER Is that any way to talk to your mother? 
Coraline is mad, and feeling mad makes her brave. 
CORALINE You aren't my mother. 
The Other Mother STRAIGHTENS. Her button eyes, now DEAD, stare into Coraline's. 
OTHER MOTHER Apologize at once, Coraline! 
Coraline stares right back, not blinking. 
CORALINE No. 
OTHER MOTHER 
(TENSELY) I'll give you to the count of three. One... 
Then she stands up, GROWING TALLER. 
CORALINE Has she taken those, too? 
SWEET GIRL GHOST Yes, miss. And hidden them. 
BOY GHOST Find our eyes, mistress, and our souls will be freed. 
CORALINE I ... I'll try. 
The ghosts PULSE with hope. Coraline sits down against the mirror door, bounces her head against it. She's not hopeless. 
Suddenly, HANDS REACH THROUGH THE MIRROR and PULL HER 
OUT! 
INT. OTHER HALLWAY - NIGHT 
C.U. of Coraline's FACE, eyes wild, as she TEARS at the hands that hold her. She GRABS one and, FLIPS her MASKED ATTACKER onto the ground. She pulls off his mask: it's the OTHER WYBIE, his mouth stitched into a PAINFUL, EAR 
TO EAR SMILE. 
CORALINE 
(PANTING) 
WYBIE?.. 
Coraline sits him up. 
CORALINE (CONT'D) Did she do this to you? 
She unstitches his painfully-huge grin. 
CORALINE (CONT'D) I hope that feels bet-- 
OTHER WYBIE Shhh. 
He stops her with a finger to her lips, and points to the Other Living Room, its door UNLOCKED AND OPEN. He grabs her hand and PULLS her there. 
INT. OTHER LIVING ROOM ­ CONTINUOUS 
It's dark, the bug furniture asleep. They run to the big armoire bug that guards the little door and SHOVE IT out of the way. It CRASHES to the floor. And from upstairs, a voice calls out. 
TALL OTHER MOTHER (O.S.) Coraline? Is that you! 
CORALINE Let's go! 
She opens the little door. A COLD WIND blows from the dark passageway, now filled with SPIDER WEBS and the SHOES, COATS, AND HATS of other kids who tried to escape. 
TALL OTHER MOTHER (O.S.) Coraline... 
The tunnel MOVES at the sound of her voice. Coraline takes Other Wybie's arm. 
CORALINE Come on. She'll hurt you again! 
He shakes his head no, then pulls off his glove to reveal a HAND MADE OF SAWDUST. He blows his fingers away. 
HIGH HEELS CLICK from the stairs; she's ALMOST THERE! 
TALL OTHER MOTHER (O.S.) Coraline? How dare you disobey your mother!! 
Other Wybie shoves Coraline into the tunnel and shuts the door. 
INT. PASSAGEWAY ­ CONTINUOUS 
Hunched down, she moves as quickly as she can, tearing through the sticky cobwebs. 
TALL OTHER MOTHER (O.S.) (calling after her) Coraline! 
Strands of web brush her face, stick to her hair; she closes her eyes, hands out until she finally gets to the little door at the other end. She DIVES, TUCKS, -- 
INT. REAL LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS TIME, BUT DAY HERE 
-- AND ROLLS OUT onto the REAL LIVING ROOM FLOOR. Coraline SLAMS the door shut and turns the sharp little key ­ still in the keyhole ­ to LOCK IT. 
She stands, covered in dust and cobwebs, and calls out with joy and relief. 
CORALINE 
I'M HOME! 
INT. HALLWAY, STAIRWAY, DAD'S STUDY - SAME 
She goes quickly through the apartment, happily calling: 
CORALINE Anybody here? Hello, hello, hello! Real Dad ... Real Mom! 
INT. KITCHEN - SAME 
CORALINE Oh, Mom's groceries! 
There are bags of groceries on the table, as if her mother had just gotten in. She pulls open a bag to peek and FRUIT FLIES shoot out. The food is spoiled. 
CORALINE (CONT'D) 
(PUZZLED) Uhhh. That's disgusting. 
Holds her hands up. 
CORALINE (CONT'D) But it's all a trap! 
Wybie, eager to escape, cups hand to ear by the window. 
WYBIE Yeah... Uh, I think I heard someone calling me, Jonesy. 
Coraline sees right through him. 
CORALINE Don't believe me?... You can ask the cat! 
He moves around her towards the door, turns to leave. 
WYBIE The cat... I-I'll just tell Gramma that you couldn't find the doll-- OW! 
A blue boot - thrown by Coraline - HITS his arm. He turns back as she takes off the second one. 
CORALINE You're not LISTENING TO ME! 
WYBIE That's ... cause ... you're CRAZY! 
He FLEES as the second boot flies past. Coraline GROWLS, and gives chase. 
INT UPPER STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS 
She grabs her boots from the floor, and CHASES him down the stairs in her socks. 
EXT. FRONT DOOR/DRIVEWAY - CONTINUOUS, RAINING 
Door flies open and Wybie RUNS down the front steps to his electric bike. Coraline RACES down after him. 
CORALINE You creep! 
WYBIE (calling over his shoulder) Crazy!! 
He RUNS his bike towards the FALLEN TREE, HOPS ON and PEDALS LIKE MAD. As Coraline hurls a boot at him, he GUNS the motor and escapes down a side path past the driveway. 
CORALINE Crazy?... You're the jerk-wad that gave me the doll! 
Out of breath, she turns away and notices her PARENTS' CAR parked to the side. 
CORALINE (CONT'D) Mom!   Dad! 
Excited, she hops over the fallen tree and runs to the car. 
INT. JONES' CAR - SAME 
Coraline, standing in the rain, excitedly looks through the car's window. But the car is EMPTY. She spots her mom's PHONE, then opens the door to grabs it and speed dial a number. 
CORALINE Pick it up, Dad, pick it up. 
CHARLIE (V.O.) Hi! 
CORALINE Dad!   Whe- 
CHARLIE (V.O.) I'm digging in my garden right now, but leave a message and I'll get right back to you. 
She dejectedly looks at the phone, then snaps it shut. 
CORALINE Where have you gone? 
INT. SPINK AND FORCIBLE'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING 
Miss Spink is knitting a SWEATER WITH WINGS for a worried- looking ANGUS, one of the Scotties, who sits on her lap. 
Coraline sips tea, anxious, the other two DOGS beside her. 
CORALINE Uh... don't you only make wings for the ... dead ones? 
MISS SPINK Just looking ahead dear... Angus hasn't been feeling very well of late. 
MISS FORCIBLE (O.S.) April? Aren't you getting ready? 
MISS SPINK (looks off camera) We've lost our ride, Miriam. Caroline says her parents have vanished, quite completely. 
ANGLE ON Miss Forcible, tightening her elaborate corset behind a screen, using pulleys and hooks. 
MISS FORCIBLE What?! We've waited months for those tickets. 
One of the corset hooks FLIES UP and pulls off her wig. She ignores it and comes over to address Spink. 
MISS SPINK I suppose we could walk! 
MISS FORCIBLE With your gamy legs? It's nearly two miles to the theater! 
Coraline CLEARS HER THROAT, frustrated. 
MISS SPINK Oh, oh yes ... your missing parents. We know just what you need. Miriam, get...that's right. 
Miss Forcible grabs another dish of old stuck-together candy and puts it in front of Coraline. 
CORALINE How is hundred-year-old candy going to 
HELP-- 
INT CORALINE'S BEDROOM   - CONTINUOUS 
Series of quick shots of Coraline getting ready to go. Pulls her collecting bag from the closet, her puffy vest, her boots; grabs a candle and garden shears, puts them in the bag. She stands to go, taking her cap off the chair. The ODD PIECE OF CANDY, the triangle green one with the hole, drops to the floor. She hesitates a moment, then sticks it in her bag. 
INT. PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS 
We hear the click of the door being unlocked. It opens to reveal the cat, and - holding a lit candle - Coraline. She leaves the key in the lock, like always, takes a breath and crawls forward. 
The candle casts huge, flickering shadows along the wall. The cat, his voice returned, SPEAKS to her. 
CAT You know, you're walking right into her trap. 
CORALINE I have to go back. 
With great feeling, she explains: 
CORALINE (CONT'D) They are my parents. 
CAT Challenge her then. She may not play fair but she won't refuse. She's got a thing for games. 
Coraline thinks about it, remembering. 
CORALINE Hmmm, okay. 
The door at the end of the tunnel clicks open, the candle BLOWS OUT and the cat VANISHES IN THE DARK. Coraline tenses when a voice calls out. 
MOTHER Coraline? 
CORALINE Mom? 
There, framed in the open door, back-lit in blue, Coraline's REAL MOTHER, with neck brace and dressed in her shopping clothes, calls. 
MOTHER Coraline, you came back for us! 
CORALINE 
(RELIEVED) 
MOM! 
She runs forward eagerly and-- 
INT. OTHER LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
--out the Other Little Door, throwing her arms out to hug her real Mom. 
MOTHER Darling! (voice shifting) Why would you run away from me? 
Coraline sees her mother's hand GROW as it wraps around her. Alarmed, she PUSHES AWAY and sees the DECOY MOM grow into the TALL OTHER MOTHER. 
The room LIGHTS UP with the glowing bug furniture and a fireplace fire. 
Coraline tries her best to be brave. 
CORALINE Where are my parents? 
The Tall Other Mother's button eyes GLITTER. 
TALL OTHER MOTHER Gosh, I have no idea where your "old" parents are. Perhaps they've grown bored of you and run away to France? 
Her teeth gleam. 
CORALINE They weren't bored of me.   You stole them! 
Other Father, a FOOT SHORTER than before, his sagging face a pale PUMPKIN color, his hair VINES, comes up behind Coraline. 
TALL OTHER MOTHER Now, don't be difficult, Coraline. Have a seat, won't you? 
Other Father, GURGLING happily, herds Coraline onto the walking bug chair. 
The Tall Other Mother, standing by the little door, turns to it and CLAPS her hands. 
A moment later, a HUGE RAT skitters out of the tunnel - FILLED AGAIN with spider webs and children's things - carrying the KEY from the real world door. 
The Tall Other Mother takes the key, locks the door, and - while the armoire bug assumes guard position - she 
SWALLOWS THE KEY. 
CORALINE 
(OFFHAND) Why don't you have your own key? 
OTHER FATHER Only one key. 
The Other Mother PULLS A VINE growing from his ear, 
SHUTTING HIS MOUTH. 
TALL OTHER MOTHER Shhh! 
(SUNNIER) The garden squash need tending, don't you think, pumpkin? 
She turns him around, her hands under his arms and drags him out. 
OTHER FATHER Squish squash, pumpkin sauce... 
Out the kitchen window, the FANTASTIC GARDEN LIGHTS UP, answering her question. She FURROWS HER BROWS, thinks this was too easy. 
CORALINE (CONT'D) Hmmm. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. OTHER GARDEN - SAME 
Coraline walks through the gates. The bright magic of the garden is DARKER NOW, with areas of black against areas of glowing flowers. 
She passes the PITCHER PLANTS, and the one with the frog suddenly SWALLOWS the animal. 
She goes up the steps past the BLEEDING HEARTS, which now LEAK STICKY RED JUICE that runs down the wall. 
At the top, a few SNAPDRAGONS, feeble now, SNAP at her. She KICKS them down. Behind her, a brick tree ring OPENS like a monster's MOUTH and five HUGE, PALE SNAPDRAGONS sneak towards her. They ATTACK, knock her to the ground, spilling her bag. 
CORALINE No!! 
They GRAB CORALINE at her ankles, knees, hips, waist, and shoulder, and start to ROLL HER UP TOWARDS THE STONE 
MOUTH. 
Coraline is just able to GRAB her GARDEN SHEARS. She CUTS OFF one mutant snapdragon's head, then another, until she is free. The HEADLESS STEMS retreat into the rock mouth. 
Coraline, winded, goes to gather her spilled things when a trio of HUMMINGBIRDS/WASP HYBRIDS SWOOP IN. They don't attack her; instead they poke their long beaks into the TRIANGLE CANDY WITH THE HOLE and LIFT OFF. 
CORALINE (CONT'D) Stop!! 
Coraline chases them, but they're getting away. As she crosses the little bridge, she takes off her cap and FLINGS IT LIKE A FRISBEE at them. SCORE! They fall to the ground, near the eyebrow shrubs, sawdust spilling out. She picks up the triangle candy. 
CORALINE (CONT'D) Why steal this? 
With a look of what does she have to lose, she holds it up to her eye and GASPS. 
CORALINE (CONT'D) Wow... 
EVERYTHING IS BLURRY GREY like a pencil drawing, all color gone. She scans the garden, turning slowly. As she turns back to where she started, she sees something, right in front of her: a BURNING RED EMBER -- A GHOST'S 
EYE! 
CORALINE (CONT'D) That must be it. 
She lowers the stone from her eye, to see that the ghost's eye is the FADED STICK SHIFT KNOB from the preying mantis tractor, which STANDS RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER with the Other Father, a SQUAT PUMPKIN MAN, at its controls, his own hands IMPRISONED IN THE MECHANICAL 
PIANO HANDS. 
HEADLIGHTS GLARE and the tractor ROARS TO LIFE. The mechanical hands FORCE Other Father to SHIFT GEARS, and the tractor LURCHES at Coraline, its arms SLASHING. She yells, backs away. Other Father calls in a garbled voice: 
OTHER FATHER Sorrry, so sorrry, Motherrr making meeee. 
Coraline backs onto the little bridge that spans the fountains as the tractor moves in. 
OTHER FATHER (CONT'D) Don't waaaanno hurrrrrt you. 
The Other Father tries to steer the tractor away, but the mechanical hands are stronger. It moves onto the bridge - STUPIDLY SMASHING THROUGH THE PLANKS in front of it. Halfway over, it lurches, then STARTS TO FALL THROUGH THE HOLE IT HAS CREATED. The tractor hangs precariously for a moment. 
Other Father KICKS away one mechanical hand, and with ONE HAND FREE, manages to PULL OFF THE SHIFT KNOB. 
OTHER FATHER (CONT'D) Taaaake it!!!!! 
Coraline DIVES FORWARD and just GETS THE KNOB before the tractor and Other Father fall away and SINK UNDER THE 
WATER. 
Rippling out from Coraline like a gray wave, the entire 
GARDEN BECOMES ASHEN AND DEAD. 
Coraline CATCHES HER BREATH, shaken. The ghost eye/gear knob GLOWS RED, no magic candy necessary. 
BOY GHOST Bless you, miss, you found me! But there's two eyes still lost. 
CORALINE Don't worry, I'm getting the hang of it! 
Coraline looks past the greyed garden towards the Other House. A LUNAR ECLIPSE has begun, the full moon a pale acid green. 
Coraline looks concerned, then resolved, and then she heads towards the house. A haunting version of Spink and Forcible's show song starts to play... 
EXT. OTHER HOUSE, STAIRWAY TO SPINK AND FORCIBLE'S - SAME 
CORALINE'S POV DOWN STAIRWAY: chaser lights circle the door at half-speed. Haunting show song continues. 
REVERSE ON Coraline. She carefully descends towards CAM. 
INT DOWNSTAIRS THEATRE - SAME 
WE SEE her flickering shadow and then Coraline appears behind the entry curtains. She steps close, pulls the curtain open. Song stops. 
POV ON THEATER, quiet and dark save for light coming through entry curtains. She spots usher's FLASHLIGHT on the ground. 
ON CORALINE - she picks it up, clicks it on, and STEPS FORWARD. She sweeps the light beam around, apprehensive, then HEARS SOMETHING overhead. She aims flashlight up and startles a NEST OF BAT-DOGS - half Scotties/half bats. One bares his teeth and GROWLS. She clicks off the light and shivers. 
On stage, one spotlight and footlights FADE UP on a huge, wrapped SALTWATER TAFFY. It hangs from ropes and sandbags. 
She cautiously climbs up onto the stage. A HUMAN-SIZED TAFFY THING - striped pale pink and green - can just be seen through the wrapper. She holds her TRIANGLE CANDY- WITH-HOLE to her eye. There is a BLUE-WHITE GLOW coming from inside the wrapper. 
INT. CIRCUS TENT - CONTINUOUS 
The Other Mr. B is perched on a pile of MOLDY CHEESES in the center of the ring. He moves like all his bones are broken. 
OTHER MR. BOBINSKY If you stay here, you can have vhatever you vant, vsig-DA - alvays. 
Coraline raises the triangle candy to her eye, sees the AMBER GLOW coming from inside his hat. 
CORALINE You don't get it, do you? 
She moves closer. 
OTHER MR. BOBINSKY I don't understand. 
Small forms MOVE under the back of his coat. 
CORALINE Of course you don't understand. You're just a copy she made of the real Mr. B. 
OTHER MR. BOBINSKY (last breath) Not even that anymore. 
Coraline pulls off his hat. Instead of his head, a HUGE PALE RAT SITS THERE - holding the circus ball. It barks at her then DIVES DOWN the coat collar. 
RATS leap from COAT SLEEVES and PANT LEGS, Coraline pulls back, HORRIFIED, as the clothes collapse, scanning around for the circus ball. 
There's a rat bark behind her and she turns. The HUGE RAT - balanced on a wheel of cheese, circus ball in paws - TAUNTS HER, then RUNS THE CHEESE OUT THE DOOR! She GIVES 
CHASE. 
INT. OTHER MR. B'S FLAT - CONTINUOUS 
The OTHER RATS RACE behind the twin rows of cannons - the cheese wheel rat rolls through them, heading towards the door! 
Coraline CHARGES. The cannons, manned by rats, FIRE COTTON CANDY at her. She's HIT in the side, her leg, her ribs; she weaves and STUMBLES, the shots landing like punches. 
CORALINE Ahhh! No!! 
A PET DOOR - perfectly shaped for the rat on the wheel - appears in the front door as the rat approaches. 
Coraline looks up to see the PET DOOR OPEN and the CHEESE- 
WHEEL RAT HEADING THROUGH IT TO THE OUTSIDE. 
Coraline takes her triangle candy stone and THROWS IT as hard as she can AT THE RAT. 
The whistling candy FLIES through the pet door towards the RAT, just outside. 
EXT. OTHER MR. B'S FLAT - CONTINUOUS 
The RAT DUCKS, the CANDY MISSES, and the cheese-wheel rat ESCAPES down the stairs with the ball. 
INT. OTHER MR. B'S FLAT - CONTINUOUS 
Coraline, lurching forward, HOLLERS. 
CORALINE (CONT'D) 
NOOOO! 
Two waiting rats - tail tips tied - pull tails tight, and TRIP her. She CRASHES THROUGH THE DOOR AND--. 
EXT. OTHER HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
--OUT onto the balcony which TEARS AWAY FROM THE HOUSE with ATTACHED STAIRWAY. 
CORALINE Noooo! 
The whole rig, with Coraline on top, ROTATES as it collapses, THROWING CORALINE toward the front of the house when it HITS THE GROUND. She BLACKS OUT a moment. 
WHEEZING for breath, Coraline pushes up on hands and knees and SCANS past the topiaries and poplars and white gravel driveway, looking for the cheese-wheel rat and circus ball. No cheese-wheel rat, no circus ball ghost eye. 
Coraline, lit by a NARROWING BAND of pale green light, turns to look at the moon. It's nearly covered now by the 
DARK BUTTON SHADOW. 
Her HAND stings from a scrape. BLOOD trickles from her knee. She feels nothing but COLD LOSS. 
CORALINE (CONT'D) 
(DEVASTATED) Oh God, I've lost the game; I've lost everything. 
She sobs, hugs knees and face to chest. The band of light that illuminates her is narrowing to near-gone. 
In the foreground, the HEAD of the cheese-wheel rat - CIRCUS BALL IN ITS TEETH - DROPS ON THE GROUND. Sawdust leaks from its neck. Band of light STOPS NARROWING, the eclipse paused. 
There's a familiar MEROWWW and Coraline looks up. 
Across from her on the front yard, sits the BLACK CAT, licking his paws, rat's head and circus ball at his feet. 
CAT I think I mentioned that I don't like rats at the best of times. 
Coraline smiles, walks towards him. 
CORALINE I think you might have said something like that. 
CAT It looked like you needed this one, however. 
MEL (CONT'D) Oh no, you broke my favorite snow globe. 
CORALINE I didn't break it. It must've broke when you escaped. 
Mom spots her bloody knee. 
MEL And cut your knee. 
Charlie crouches low, clutching his briefcase. 
CHARLIE Coraline, I asked you to count all the windows, not put your knee through them. 
CORALINE 
BUT- 
Mel tells her. 
MEL Well, get yourself cleaned up, 
(WARMS) we're going out tonight. 
CHARLIE We gotta lot to celebrate! 
Coraline, confused, takes a stab. 
CORALINE You're talking about... your garden catalog? 
MEL Of course! What else? 
Her parents turn to leave the room. 
CORALINE But look at the snow on your clothes...? 
But the snow melts without a trace. 
MEL 
(CONFUSED) What's gotten into you, Coraline? 
Her parents walk off. Coraline shrugs her shoulders and looks back to the broken snow globe on the mantel. She cocks her head, deeply puzzled, then leaves the room. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT HOUSE - NIGHT, SKY CLEAR 
The VW is parked out front, its interior light fading as light in Coraline's bedroom window switches on. We HEAR Charlie make a strangled sound. 
INT. CORALINE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT FULL MOON RISING 
Coraline sits in bed -- pajamas washed and PATCHED, wounds-dressed, hair shining. The KEY hangs from a string around her neck. A gibbous moon shines in the clear night sky. 
Charlie wrestles with a blue stuffed-toy squid like it's an alien face-hugger then, FEIGNING DEATH, falls on the bed. Coraline LAUGHS. 
CORALINE So, gonna order the tulips? 
He opens one eye, pretends he's never heard about this. 
CHARLIE What's that? 
CORALINE For the garden party!! 
He sits up and kids her, tickling her face with the squid. 
CHARLIE I have no idea what you're talking about. 
CORALINE Dad! 
She turns to Mom, arranging things on a shelf. 
CORALINE (CONT'D) So, Mom. Invitations? Don't forget the invitations. 
Her mother nods, points up. 
MEL Even Bobinsky? 
CORALINE Mr. B's not drunk, Mom, he's just...eccentric. 
Charlie LAUGHS. He bends down to kiss her. 
CHARLIE Good night, Coraline. 
As he steps away, Mel slips a slim box under the covers next to her daughter. She gives Coraline a "told you so" look, and she and Charlie leave the room. 
Coraline sits up excitedly and opens the box - it's the GREEN AND ORANGE GLOVES she'd wanted! She pulls one on to admire when the BLACK CAT appears outside her window 
CORALINE Oh, hello again. 
She walks over to the window, opens it. 
CORALINE (CONT'D) You still mad? 
His expression says yes, he's still mad. 
CORALINE (CONT'D) I'm really sorry I threw you at her - the Other Mother? ­ it was all I could think of. 
LOW ANGLE ON Coraline, moving away. The BELDAM'S HAND drops into frame and CREEP-CRAWLS after her. 
CORALINE (CONT'D) I give you lots of kisses, And I give you lots of hugs ... 
EXT. WELL - SAME 
Coraline jams the SAME DEAD BRANCH Wybie used under the well's cover, lining it up over the SAME FULCRUM ROCK. 
CORALINE ... But I never give you sandwiches With grease and worms and mung beans. 
Circling around behind the BIG STUMP, the HAND SCAMPERS behind one rock to a bush to a tree, coming closer. 
Coraline manages to lever the well's cover off to one side, leaving the WHOLE WELL OPEN. Huffing and sweating, she wipes her brow, then takes the key string that's around her neck. 
The hand, SEEING what is about to happen, RACES TOWARDS 
HER! 
Coraline lifts string and key, not quite over her head. 
The hand JUMPS onto the big stump and SPRINGS through the air to GRAB THE KEY and PULL CORALINE TO THE GROUND! 
Coraline makes a CHOKED SCREAM, her fingers caught between the key string and her neck! 
The HAND wants to DRAG HER BACK TO THE HOUSE and the 
LITTLE LOCKED DOOR THAT IS BREATHING WITH ANTICIPATION! 
A BLINDING HEADLIGHT hits HAND and CORALINE; an AIR HORN SOUNDS; and WYBIE LOVAT - hollering a BATTLE CRY all his own - comes SPEEDING DOWN THE BLUFF on his whining electric bike! 
WYBIE 
YAHHHHH!!!! 
Wybie GUNS the throttle, and, leaning out, GRABS the confused HAND with his slug tongs! 
He CIRCLES AROUND and HEADS TOWARDS THE WELL, readying to throw the hand in. But the HAND GETS FREE, and GRABS his handlebars. 
OUT OF CONTROL, Wybie's bike HITS A ROCK, and WYBIE AND HAND ARE THROWN RIGHT DOWN THE WELL. HOLLERING, he just manages to hang on with one hand! The Beldam's hand, caught on Wybie's coattail, SCRAMBLES UP his body and face and onto the well's edge where it STABS AT HIS FINGERS to make him fall! 
WYBIE (CONT'D) 
(STRUGGLING) Get off!! 
Coraline, choking, rises to her feet. She grabs her BLANKET and - in the still-blazing headlight of the crashed bike - she RUNS UP and THROWS IT OVER THE HAND. It fights like crazy as Coraline wrestles to control it. The hand STABS THROUGH THE BLANKET and SHAKES IT OFF. It crouches to attack her! 
And then WYBIE IS BACK, pumped with adrenaline, a BIG ROCK raised over his head! He HURLS IT DOWN ON THE LEAPING HAND! And it BREAKS into TWENTY LIFELESS NEEDLES. 
Wybie struggles to catch his breath. Coraline - breathing hard - removes the key and string from around her sore neck. She pulls up the corners of her blanket - with the needles on it - around the rock, and ties it all together with the string. The key is left attached. 
The two friends carry the heavy package to the well and DROP IT DOWN THE HOLE. By the light of a stray moonbeam, they watch and listen until it makes a muffled splash in the dark water at the bottom. They slide the well cover in place. 
Still catching his breath, Wybie stands, holding his injured hand, its glove ripped by the Beldam's claw. He looks over at Coraline as the scene brightens a little with moonlight. 
WYBIE (CONT'D) I-I'm really sorry I didn't believe you about all this ... evil stuff, Coraline. 
Coraline, shoulders rising as she catches her breath, stands and smiles: he called her by real name for the first time. 
CORALINE Why did you change your mind? 
He walks over, and takes out an old B&W photo from his jacket. 
WYBIE W-well, Gramma showed me this picture, after I called you crazy? 
He hands it to her. 
ANGLE ON PHOTO: two light-skinned black girls - dressed in old-fashioned clothing - stand in front of the Pink Palace, before it was divided into apartments. One looks just like the sweet ghost girl, and holds the DOLL WITH BUTTON EYES, which looks just like her. 
WYBIE (O.C.) (CONT'D) It's her and her sister, before she disappeared. 
ANGLE ON WYBIE AND CORALINE. Behind them, blossoms fall like snow in the orchard. 
CORALINE The sweet ghost girl. 
Wybie's grandmother, loud and worried, calls from the distance. 
WYBIE'S GRANDMOTHER (O.C.) Wyborne!   Come home!! 
WYBIE (re: his grandmother) Oh, man...what am I going to tell her? 
She looks up from the photo and smiles. 
CORALINE Just bring her by the house tomorrow.      We can tell her together. 
WYBIE We...we can?? 
CORALINE You know, I'm glad you decided to stalk me. 
She gives Wybie a playful punch on the arm and LAUGHS. 
WYBIE Wasn't my idea. 
The BLACK CAT jumps up on the TREE STUMP and MEROWWS. Coraline smiles. 
We TILT UP to the sky and see the last ropey clouds - like two clawed hands - clear away from the bright gibbous moon.

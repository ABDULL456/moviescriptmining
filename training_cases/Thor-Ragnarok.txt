A3   THE MARVEL LOGO. SMOLDERING, BEGINNING TO TURN ORANGE IN THE    A3 HEAT AS WE TILT UP TO SEE- 
-FIRE.    NOTHING BUT FIRE. 
2    INT. TIGHT SPACE - INDETERMINATE TIME                           2 
Dark and cramped. The soft red light of fire seeps through iron slats. Inside this cage is a man, bound by chains. 
It's THOR. His beard is long and his clothes are worn. That rough, grizzled look of a man who's spent years on the road. 
He awakens with a JOLT.   Looks around. 
THOR Now I know what you're thinking. Oh no! Thor's in a cage. How did this happen? (then:) Well, sometimes you have to get captured just to get a straight answer out of somebody. It's a long story but basically I'm a bit of a hero. See, I spent some time on earth, fought some robots, saved the planet a couple of times. Then I went searching through the cosmos for some magic, colorful Infinity Stone things... didn't find any. That's when I came across a path of death and destruction which led me all the way here into this cage... where I met you. 
Reveal that he's talking to a weird alien skeleton in chains. 
THOR (CONT'D) How much longer do you think we'll be here? 
NOISE.    Sounds of metal gears TURNING. 
Suddenly the bottom DROPS OUT! Thor PLUMMETS until - SHLINK! Chains CINCH and abruptly halt his descent. Thor dangles six feet off the ground. Pull back to reveal we are in- BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                    2. 
3   INT. SURTUR'S LAIR - CONTINUOUS                                  3 
A cavernous space. The walls, floors, and ceilings are molten rock, which has creepy glimmers of fire within it. Stationed in the center is a volcanic rock throne, and sitting in that throne is a charred demonic skeleton. 
SURTUR (O.S.) Thor, Son of Odin. 
Thor's chain turns to reveal- 
-SURTUR on his throne. Eighteen-feet-tall, flesh made of fire, and demonic spiked horns on his skull. 
THOR Surtur. Son of a bitch...you're still alive! I thought my father killed you, like, half a million years ago. 
SURTUR I cannot die. Not until I fulfill my destiny and lay waste to your home. 
THOR You know, it's funny you should mention that because I've been having these terrible dreams of late. Asgard up in flames, falling to ruins, and you Surtur are at the center of all of them. 
SURTUR Then you have seen Ragnarok, the fall of Asgard. The great prophecy-- 
THOR (O.S.) Hang on.   Hang on. 
Reveal that Thor's chain is turning VERY SLOWLY. 
THOR (CONT'D) I'll be back around shortly. I really feel like we were connecting there. 
After a beat, Thor rotates around to face Surtur. 
THOR (CONT'D) Okay, so, Ragnarok. Tell me about that. Walk me through it. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16           3. 
SURTUR My time has come. When my crown is reunited with the Eternal Flame, I shall be restored to my full might. I will tower over the mountains and bury my sword deep in Asgard's-- 
THOR Oh, hang on. Give it a second. 
Once again, Thor is turning VERY SLOWLY. 
THOR (CONT'D) I swear I'm not even moving, it's just doing this on its own. I'm really sorry. (then:) Okay, let me get this straight. You're going to put your crown into the Eternal Flame, and then you'll suddenly grow as big as a house-- 
SURTUR A mountain! 
THOR The Eternal Flame that Odin keeps locked away on Asgard? 
Surtur grins, evil. 
SURTUR Odin is not on Asgard. And your absence has left the throne defenseless. 
That elicits a concerned look from Thor. 
THOR Okay, so where is it? This crown? 
SURTUR This is my Crown, the source of my power. 
Surtur points at the V-shaped horns on his head.. 
THOR Oh, that's a crown? I thought it was a big eyebrow. 
SURTUR It's a crown. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                   4. 
THOR Anyway, it sounds like all I have to do to stop Ragnarok is rip that thing off your head. 
Surtur stands up and approaches Thor, DRAGGING his sword. 
SURTUR But Ragnarok has   already begun. You cannot stop it.    I am Asgard's doom, and so are   you. All will suffer, all will   burn. 
Surtur steps forward and GRABS the chain above Thor's feet, holding it so he and Thor are face to face. 
THOR That's intense. To be honest, seeing you grow really big and set fire to a planet would be quite the spectacle. But it looks like I'm going to have to go with option B where I bust out of these chains, knock that tiara off your head, and stash it away in Asgard's vault. 
SURTUR You cannot stop Ragnarok. Why fight it? 
Behind his back, Thor opens his hand.    Sending out the SOS. 
THOR Because that's what heroes do. 
SKURGE You girls are in for a treat. 
Angle on Heimdall's sword, which has been sloppily cast aside in another pile of "stuff." Skurge hastily runs and grabs it. 
10   EXT. MUSPELHEIM - CONTINUOUS                                    10 
Thor is FLYING at top speed, but that dragon is right on his heels! The fire demons LAUNCH flaming projectiles from below! 
Thor looks back, genuinely nervous. The dragon is OPENING its jaws to swallow Thor whole when- 
-Suddenly Bi-Frost OPENS! The portal surrounds Thor and engulfs the dragon's head! In an instant, they're gone. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                 8. 
MAIN TITLE 
11   INT. THE OBSERVATORY - MOMENTS LATER                           11 
Skurge has plunged Heimdall's sword into Bi-Frost. 
BOOM! Thor EXPLODES out of the portal along with the severed head of the dragon! SPLAT! Blood and guts RAIN DOWN on Skurge and the two women, DRENCHING them with purple gore. 
The dragon's head SLIDES slowly across the floor, coming to rest right in front of the women who are frozen in shock. 
The women SHRIEK and rush out of the Observatory. Thor meanwhile is clean and staggering back to his feet. He looks up to Skurge, who is wiping dragon guts off of himself. 
SKURGE Girls! (beat) Well well, look who decided to pop in. Thanks for scaring away my company and drenching my workplace in brains. 
THOR Who are you? 
SKURGE Don't you remember? I'm Skurge. (Thor doesn't) We fought together on Vanaheim. 
THOR Right.   Where's Heimdall? 
SKURGE That traitor. No one knows, he's a fugitive of the throne. 
THOR Traitor? 
SKURGE Yeah, you see, Odin charged Heimdall with negligence of duty, but he disappeared before the trial. Hard to catch a guy who can see everything in the Universe. 
Thor starts to say something, but then gives up. Instead he starts towards the exit... but Skurge stands in his way. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                  9. 
THOR Sure. 
SKURGE Hold on. I'm supposed to announce your arrival. 
Thor SPINS UP Mjolnir and takes off in a blur.   Skurge starts the loooong run down the Rainbow Bridge. 
12    OMITTED                                                          12 
A13   EXT. THEATER ENTRANCE - DAY                                      A13 
THOR arrives with Surtur's skull. 
There's a small crowd making its way through a threshold over which stands a monumental statue of Loki, arms out-stretched in the `savior' pose. 
Confused, Thor turns to a theater patron. 
THOR What the hell is that? 
13    EXT. ASGARD - ROYAL TERRACE - PATIO - MOMENTS LATER              13 
LOKI falls into frame, GASPING FOR BREATH... although it's not Loki. This is ACTOR LOKI and we're watching a STAGE PLAY. 
In the background, a single musician plays the haunting score from THOR: THE DARK WORLD on a pan flute. 
Suddenly, ACTOR THOR leans into shot, holding Actor Loki. 
ACTOR LOKI Oh, brother. This is it.    I take my leave. 
ACTOR THOR You fool, you didn't listen! 
ACTOR LOKI I'm sorry. 
ACTOR THOR Lady Sif!     Get help! 
"Sif" awkwardly runs off. The "Warriors Three" watch sadly. A small choir JOINS IN as the music builds to a CRESCENDO. 
ACTOR SIF Somebody help! BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                10. 
In the middle of the audience we reveal ODIN, sitting upon a chaise lounge, sipping wine and thoroughly enjoying the show. Unseen, Thor arrives behind the audience and watches. 
ACTOR LOKI Sorry for all I've done. 
ACTOR THOR It's all right.   Hold on. 
ACTOR LOKI I'm sorry I tried to rule Earth. 
ACTOR THOR They'd be lucky to have you. 
ACTOR LOKI I'm sorry about that thing with the Tesseract. I just couldn't help myself. 
ACTOR THOR I know. 
ACTOR LOKI I'm a trickster. 
ACTOR THOR So mischievous. 
ACTOR LOKI Sorry about that time I turned you into a frog. 
ACTOR THOR It was a wonderful joke. 
ODIN (to no-one in particular) Twas indeed hilarious. 
ACTOR THOR You are the savior of Asgard. 
LOKI Alright, I yield! 
Thor DROPS Loki to the ground and catches Mjolnir. Loki looks to Thor, hands up defensively. Skurge arrives on the scene, a little late to warn Loki. 
SKURGE Behold!   Thor..Odinson. 
LOKI You had one job!    Just the one. 
THOR Where's Odin? 
LOKI You just couldn't stay away, could you? Everything was fine without you. Asgard was prospering (gestures to the crowd) You've ruined everything. Ask them. 
Those who aren't freaked out are becoming gradually angrier. 
Thor advances on Loki, who backs up onto the chaise lounge. 
THOR Where's father?    Did you kill him? 
LOKI You had what you wanted, you had the independence you asked for! 
Thor PRESSES Mjolnir onto Loki's chest. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                 15. 
LOKI (CONT'D) Ow-ow-ow! Alright! I know exactly where he is. 
14   OMITTED                                                        14

17   EXT. SHADY ACRES NURSING HOME - MANHATTAN - DAY                17 
A NURSING HOME sign on a brick wall. Suddenly the wall crumbles out of shot, revealing a demolition site. 
Reveal Thor and Loki wearing street clothes. Thor carries an umbrella, Loki is dressed in a weird avant-garde suit. 
LOKI I swear, I left him right here. 
THOR Right here on the sidewalk? Or right there, where the building that's being demolished? Great planning. 
LOKI How was I supposed to know? Can't see into the future. I'm not a witch. 
THOR Then why do you dress like one? 
LOKI Hey. 
THOR I can't believe you're alive. I saw you die. I mourned you, I cried for you. 
LOKI I'm honored. 
COLLEGE GIRL 2 Ask him. 
COLLEGE GIRL 1 Hi. Would you mind taking a picture with us? BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16             16. 
THOR Sure. (to Loki:) Start figuring out where he is. 
COLLEGE GIRL 1 Oh, my god. 
COLLEGE GIRL 2 Sorry to hear that Jane dumped you. 
THOR She didn't dump me, you know.       I dumped her. It was a mutual dumping. 
Thor notices something going on around Loki. 
THOR (CONT'D) What's this, what are you doing!? 
Loki looks down to see that the sidewalk has started to GLOW BENEATH HIM! A circle of ancient symbols. 
LOKI This... isn't me. 
WHOOMPF! Loki DROPS out of sight, vanishing through solid concrete! Thor sees a CARD on the sidewalk where Loki was. 
Thor pokes the business card. 
THOR Loki? 
He picks up the card.    It reads: 
177A Bleecker Street 
Thor picks up the card and - WHOOSH! 
18   EXT. SANCTUM SANTORUM - DAY                                    18 
Thor approaches 177A Bleecker Street. 
He knocks ONCE, TWICE, and then WHOOSH! 
19   INT. SANCTUM SANCTORUM UPSTAIRS PARLOR - CONTINUOUS            19 
Thor is suddenly inside Doctor Strange's lair! BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                  17. 
STRANGE (O.S.) Thor Odinson. 
From a dark corner we glimpse a shape - DOCTOR STRANGE. Levitating, he drifts towards Thor. 
STRANGE (CONT'D) God of Thunder. 
Thor holds up the ratty umbrella, ready to defend himself. 
STRANGE (CONT'D) You can put down the umbrella. 
Thor gives Strange a sideways look but then sets his umbrella down. When he looks back up, the environment is furnished. 
DR. STRANGE (to Thor:) You can handle him from here. 
THOR Yeah of course. (they shake hands) Thank you very much for your help. 
STRANGE Good luck. 
LOKI Handle me?     Who are you? 
THOR Loki. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                   21. 
Loki DRAWS a dagger, ready to attack Strange. 
LOKI ..you think you're some kind of sorcerer? Don't think for one minute, you second-rate... 
DR. STRANGE Bye-bye. 
Strange GESTURES with both hands and- 
-WHOOSH!   PULLS the magic portal over them. 
Just like that, Thor and Loki are gone. 
20   OMITTED                                                            20 
21   EXT. CLIFFS - DAY                                                  21 
Beautiful, undisturbed nature.       We hear the ocean nearby. 
LOKI lands on the ground, portal closes behind them. 
THOR Father? 
A lone figure stands at the other side of the meadow at the cliff's edge, waves CRASHING below. 
It is ODIN. He's dressed plainly in humble human clothes. The boys approach him quickly. 
ODIN Look at this place. It's beautiful. 
THOR Father, it's us. 
ODIN My sons.   I've been waiting for you. 
Loki is surprised to hear Odin call him his son. 
THOR I know.    We've come to take you home. 
ODIN Home, yes. Your mother, she calls me. Do you hear it? 
Thor fires a look at Loki, who holds up his hands in defense. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                   22. 
THOR Loki, lift your magic. 
Odin turns to Loki, who stiffens.    But Odin smiles. 
ODIN Took me quite a while to break free from your spell. Frigga would have been proud. 
Loki is moved by this gesture. He looks over to see Thor staring at him, anger building. 
Odin puts a hand on Thor's shoulder, calming him. 
ODIN (CONT'D) Come and sit with me. I don't have much time. 
Odin sits, out of breath, weak.    His sons sit beside him. 
THOR I know that we failed you, but we can make this right. 
ODIN I failed you. (beat) It is upon us...Ragnarok. 
THOR No, I've stopped Ragnarok.    I put an end to Surtur. 
ODIN No. It has already begun. She's coming. My life was all that held her back, but my time has come. I cannot keep her away any longer. 
THOR Father, who are you talking about? 
ODIN The Goddess of Death.     Hela.   My first born. (faces Thor) Your sister. 
That hits Thor hard. Loki can't believe what he's hearing. 
THOR ...what? BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                  23. 
ODIN Her violent appetites grew beyond my control. I couldn't stop her, so I imprisoned her. Locked her away. She draws her strength from Asgard...and once she gets there, her powers will be limitless. 
THOR Whatever she is, we can stop her. We can face her together. 
ODIN (takes Thor's hand) No we won't. I'm on a different path now. This you must face alone. 
Odin looks into Thor's eyes, struggling to breathe. 
ODIN (CONT'D) I love you my sons. 
For the briefest of instances, father and sons share a quiet moment together. Tears well in Thor's eyes. 
ODIN (CONT'D) Look at that. 
Ethereal sun-rays stream down upon the ocean. 
ODIN (CONT'D) Remember this place. Home. 
A warm glow washes over Thor's face and he turns to see that- 
-ODIN IS DISSIPATING INTO STARDUST.   THE ALLFATHER HAS DIED. 
A moment as the brothers separately mourn for Odin. 
HELA You look like a smart boy with good survival instincts. How would you like a job? 
Hela looks out upon Asgard as Skurge rises behind her. 
24   EXT. ASGARD - THE MOUNTAINS - SAME                              24 
A mysterious HOODED FIGURE watches Hela's arrival at the Observatory and begins a steady descent towards the city. 
25   EXT. SAKAAR - THE WASTELAND SHORE - DAY                         25 
SUPER WIDE: A sky full of WORMHOLES. Thor, only a spec at this distance, SHOOTS out of one of these wormholes. He HITS the surface, causing a CLOUD of dust. 
Find Thor on his back surrounded by strange colorful space wreckage. Looking up, Thor sees a large metal object falling from a different wormhole! He rolls out of the way. THUD! BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                    27. 
Thor runs up a dune to get away from the shower of debris. 
Thor reaches the top of the dune and finds himself looking down on A BEACH in a strange WASTELAND. Camera scans a filthy dune littered with SPACE JUNK. 
Out across the OCEAN he notices A NIGHTMARE WORMHOLE - a giant open cylinder of whirling smoke and lightning storms. 
A loud noise draws Thor's attention to a HUGE RECTANGULAR "SCRAPPER" SHIP hauling a crashed SPACE VESSEL out of the water. Beneath the ship are various SCRAPPERS, masked humanoids. The ship is BLASTING WEIRD ALIEN MUSIC. 
A Scrapper notices Thor, then signals to his crew. 
LEAD SCRAPPER Are you a fighter or are you food? 
THOR I'm just passing through. 
LEAD SCRAPPER It is food. On your knees. 
Thor reaches out to summon Mjolnir.    A reflex.   Nothing. 
The LEAD SCRAPPER levels a MAGNO-RIFLE at Thor and WHAP! A solid metal projectile KNOCKS Thor flat on his back. More Scrappers attack, throwing nets and firing more projectiles. Thor tries to swat them away but they keep coming. The rest of the scrappers move in with iron bats and clubs. 
WHOOSH! A second ship arrives, landing nearby. It's cool, sleek, and dangerous, deserving of its name: WARSONG. It is also BLASTING DIFFERENT WEIRD ALIEN MUSIC. 
The FRONT of Warsong FLIPS OPEN and a GANGPLANK extends down to the ground. The scrappers stop and stare as we TRACK IN to a HERO REVEAL of SCRAPPER #142 (S142 for short) - a beautiful and ruthless asskicker. 
S142 lifts a half-empty bottle to her lips and CHUGS it. She finishes the bottle and smashes it on the side of her ship. 
SCRAPPER #142 He's MINE. 
She walks down the gangplank... before veering off course and FALLING straight off into a pile of TRASH. She's PLASTERED. 
The Scrappers shrug and start hauling Thor away. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                 28. 
SCRAPPER #142 (CONT'D) Wait! 
S142 staggers to her feet, takes a deep breath. She holds on to a piece of junk as support - some dead beast. Thor continues to struggle with his captors, tangled in nets. 
SCRAPPER #142 (CONT'D) Wait! He's mine. So if you want him, you go through me. 
The Scrappers start brandishing their weapons. 
SCRAPPER But we've already got him. 
S142 CLANGS her metal gauntlets together which activate. 
SCRAPPER #142 Alright then I guess I go through you. 
LEAD SCRAPPER More food. 
She holds out her fists as if she's operating machinery... 
...Warsong WHIRS to life. S142 clenches her fists and we hear a horrible SCREECHING NOISE as Warsong OPENS FIRE. 
She sweeps her arms out in an arc, the spray of gunfire lasting THREE SECONDS. She bangs her fists again, sending the ship into IDLE MODE. The Scrappers are now little more than tiny pieces of litter covering the beach. 
Thor is fixated on this beautiful murderer approaching. One final HUGE Scrapper comes at her with a bat. S142 casually GRABS this Scrapper and HURLS him up into the air behind her. 
THOR Thank you. 
From her belt S142 FLICKS a small glowing disc which LODGES into Thor's NECK. Far in the background, the Scrapper she threw finally HITS the ground with a loud THUD. 
She holds up a fob device and presses the button - the disc blinks and Thor is filled with the pain of a thousand screaming squirrels. He hits the ground, stunned. 
S142 DRAGS Thor towards her ship. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                   29. 
30   INT. WARSONG SHIP - DAY                                          30 
Thor's face SMUSHED up against glass.   His eyes are open. 
Thor's POV - THE CAPITAL - an eclectic city composed of salvaged items from all over the universe. 
Thor is lying in a sort of small GLASS HOLDING CELL beneath Warsong's COCKPIT. He looks up to see S142 piloting the ship. 
Thor's eyes lock in on her belt, specifically the fob device she used to activate the Obedience Disk/debilitate him. 
SCRAPPER #142 This is Scrapper 142. I need clearance and an audience with the boss. I've got something special. 
THOR Hey!   Where are you taking me? 
S142 ignores him, takes a swig from the bottle, and then nonchalantly UNCLIPS the fob from her belt. 
THOR (CONT'D) Answer me! Hey! I am Thor, son of Odin. I need to get back to Asgard. 
SCRAPPER #142 Many apologies, your majesty. 
S142 ZAPS him and guides her ship towards a COLOSSAL TOWER. 
26   EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF ASGARD - DAY                                   26 
CLOSE ON: Hela, headdress retracted, hair down, her beautiful face fully visible. We do not see who she is talking to. 
Suddenly Thor is somewhere else, surrounded weirdos and insanely dressed palace guards. 
His scream dies down self-consciously. 
A musical beat PLAYS in the background. 
THE GRANDMASTER, a tall mysterious man in golden robes. He is looking right at us. He doesn't know what to make of us. He's curious, thrilled, revolted, and titillated. 
Pulling back we see TOPAZ, his trusty guard, at his side. Two GOLDEN LADIES loiter off to the side. Other strange guests can be seen in the background. Grandmaster just stares. 
S142 stands beside Grandmaster.    Finally: 
GRANDMASTER He's wonderful. (then:) It is a he? 
Reveal S142 standing beside Thor. 
SCRAPPER #142 It's a he. 
GRANDMASTER Yeah. I love when you come to visit 142, you bring me the best stuff. (to Topaz:) Whenever we get to talking, Topaz, about Scrapper 142...what do I always say? "She is the..." and it starts with a B. 
TOPAZ Trash. 
GRANDMASTER No, not trash. Were you waiting just to call her that? It doesn't start with a "B." 
TOPAZ Booze hag. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                  34. 
GRANDMASTER I'm so sorry. No, "best." I was thinking about "best." (to S142:) Because I always say you're the best. She brought me my precious beloved Champion, you know. 
TOPAZ You say that every time she's here. 
GRANDMASTER What have you brought today?    Tell me. 
SCRAPPER #142 A contender. 
THOR A what? 
GRANDMASTER I need to go closer. I want a closer look at this. Can you take us closer? Thank you. 
Grandmaster advances on Thor.    Examining him closely and strangely. Then: 
GRANDMASTER (CONT'D) Pay this lady. 
THOR Just wait a damn minute.    I'm not for sale. 
Using all his might, Thor breaks out of his shackles, but- 
-S142 ZAPS him again.    Paralyzed by superheated veins. 
GRANDMASTER Man.   He is a fighter. 
SCRAPPER #142 I'd take 10 million. 
TOPAZ Tell her she's dreaming. 
GRANDMASTER For heaven's sake, transfer the units. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                   35. 
Topaz transfers S142 the units. Without sympathy or ceremony, S142 exits. 
THOR You'll pay for this! 
SCRAPPER #142 No, I got paid for this. 
Thor claws at the obedience disk, trying to RIP IT OUT. 
He gets some separation from his skin, but the disk is causing him even more pain. Thor eventually has to let go. Grandmaster holds up HIS OWN fob device and uses it like a wand to guide Thor's HOVER CHAIR, which follows Grandmaster around as he speaks. 
GRANDMASTER Here's what I wanna know.    Who are you? 
THOR I am the God of THUNDER!!! 
Thor THRUSTS his arms into the air but only a tiny bit of static electricity POPS within Thor's hands. 
GRANDMASTER Wow. I didn't hear any thunder, but out of your fingers, was that like...sparkles? 
TOPAZ We located your cousin. 
GRANDMASTER Oh good! (to Thor:) Yeah, come on. I think you're gonna like this. 
Grandmaster moves Thor's chair to another section where- 
-COUSIN CARLO is waiting. He's strapped to a chair like Thor, and he is terrified. 
GRANDMASTER (CONT'D) There he is. Hey, cuz. We almost couldn't find you. What, have you been hiding? 
Cousin Carlo looks at Thor, cowering in fear. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                   36. 
THOR Hi. 
Carlo only further weeps. 
GRANDMASTER So... 
COUSIN CARLO Please.   I'm sorry. 
GRANDMASTER Carlo... I pardon you. 
COUSIN CARLO Thank you.     Thank you. 
GRANDMASTER You're officially pardoned...from life. 
Grandmaster casually takes Topaz's Sakaarian Guard staff and JABS it into his cousin's mid-section- 
-CAUSING ALL OF HIS FLESH TO MELT OFF HIS SKELETON! 
THOR Fine. Then point me in the direction of whoever's ass I have to kick. 
GRANDMASTER That's what I call, contender! Direction would be this way, Lord. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                40. 
THOR Loki! 
Guards arrive.    They haul Thor up and escort him out.

34   INT. THE ARENA - GLADIATOR CELLS - NIGHT                        34 
Thor is shoved into a spacious cell where other alien prisoners are lurking in the back. 
The thick cell door SLAMS SHUT behind Thor. Thor gets up and immediately begins THROWING his shoulder into the door. The door doesn't budge, not even a little. 
Behind him, KORG, a hulking Kronan rock alien, speaks up. 
KORG Hey! Take it easy man! (Thor looks back) Over here. The pile of rocks waving at you. Yeah I'm actually a thing, I'm a being. Allow me to introduce myself, my name is Korg. I'm kind of like the leader in here. I'm made of rocks, as you can see, but don't let that intimidate you. You don't need to be afraid unless you're made of scissors. (GIGGLES to himself) Just a little rock-paper-scissor joke for you. This is my very good friend over here, Miek. He's an insect and has knives for hands. 
MIEK, a slug alien inside a robot exoskeleton, says hello by doing some karate moves. 
THOR You're a Kronan, aren't you? 
KORG That I am. 
THOR How'd you end up in here? 
KORG Well, I tried to start a revolution but didn't print enough pamphlets, so hardly anyone turned up. (MORE) BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                41. 
KORG (CONT'D) Except for my mom and her boyfriiend, who I hate. As punishment, I was forced to be in here and become a gladiator. Bit of a promotional disaster. (secretive) But I'm actually organizing another revolution. I don't know if you'd be interested in something like that. Do you reckon you'd be interested? 
Thor tries to run ahead down the circle and loops back around behind Korg. 
THOR How did you... 
KORG Yeah, no. This whole thing is a circle. But not a real circle, more like a freaky circle. 
THOR This doesn't make any sense. 
KORG No, nothing makes sense here. The only thing that does make sense, is that nothing makes sense. 
THOR Has anyone here fought the Grandmaster's Champion? 
KORG Doug has. Doug! (realizes) Oh, right, Doug's dead. That's right. Everyone who fights the Grandmaster's champion perishes. 
THOR What about you? You're made of rocks. 
KORG Perishable rocks. (a pebble FALLS OFF) There you go. Another one gone. Yeah, no, I just do the smaller fights, warm up the crowd and whatnot. Wait. You're not gonna face him, are you? BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                  42. 
THOR Yes I am. Fight him, win, and get the hell out of this place. 
KORG That's exactly what Doug used to say. See you later, new Doug. 
Korg walks away and approaches Miek. 
A35   EXT. ASGARD - STREETS - SUNSET                                    A35 
The streets of Asgard are cold and silent, save for the occasional distant sounds and screams of a city under siege. 
35    OMITTED                                                           35 
A36   INT. THRONE ROOM - CONTINUOUS                                     A36 
Moving down the throne room corridor we see- 
-SEVERAL DEAD EINHERJAR GUARDS. 
One guy is still alive, desperately trying to crawl away. 
SHLNK!    A black blade finishes him off. 
Reveal HELA and SKURGE looking down at the carnage. 
Hela directs her attention to FRESCOS ON THE CEILING. Like the Sistine Chapel, except these depict Asgard's shining influence on the Nine Realms. Bountiful harvests, shepherds with full flocks, common folk throwing parades for Asgard's army, etc. 
HELA Does no one remember me? (awaiting an answer) Has no one been taught our history? Look at these lies. Goblets and garden parties? Peace treaties? 
Hela leads them towards the throne. 
HELA (CONT'D) Odin... proud to have it... ashamed of how he got it. 
Hela FIRES SPIKES into the ceiling, RIPPING DOWN plaster. 
Beneath the surface are older Frescos.      These ones are far more dark and sinister. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16              43. 
Soldiers in battle. Blood. A giant war wolf.     Young Odin and young Hela. Slaves building the palace. 
Skurge is at least somewhat disturbed by this. 
HELA (CONT'D) We were unstoppable. I was his weapon in the conquest that built Asgard's empire. One by one, the realms became ours. 
Hela turns from the murals to address Skurge. 
HELA (CONT'D) But then, simply because my ambition outgrew his...he banished me, caged me, locked me away like an animal. Before that, Asgard's warriors were honored, their bodies buried as heroes beneath this very place. 
Hela beckons Skurge to follow her. 
B36   INT. ODIN'S VAULT - CONTINUOUS                                  B36 
Hela enters the vault and descends the stairs towards the magical items. 
SKURGE Odin's treasures. 
Now out of stones, Thor looks around the floor for more. 
LOKI (CONT'D) Say something! 
Thor finally looks right at Loki, speaks fast and curt: 
THOR What would you like me to say? You faked your own death, you stole the throne, stripped Odin of his power, stranded him on Earth... (on Loki:) -to die, releasing the Goddess of Death. (back to Thor:) (MORE) BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                 47. 
THOR (CONT'D) Have I said enough, or do you do you want me to go further back than the past two days? 
Loki's eyes burn.   Thor stares coldly at him.   Loki tries to compose himself. 
LOKI You know, I haven't seen this Beloved Champion he talks of, but I've heard he's astonishingly savage. I've placed a large wager against you tomorrow. Don't let me down. 
Loki SHIMMERS, and his illusion vanishes.   Korg runs in to try to kick him. 
KORG Piss off, ghost! (then:) He's freaking gone. 
40   INT. THE ARENA - RECEIVING AREA                                  40 
Thor, Korg, and a gaggle of other prisoners/fighters have been led from their cells to a PRE-FIGHT HOLDING AREA. 
Korg and Thor are by the weapons rack. 
KORG Yuck! There's Still someone's hair and blood all over this. Guys, can you clean up the weapons once you finish your fight? Disgusting slobs. (then:) Thor...wanna use a big wooden fork? 
THOR No. 
KORG Yeah, not really useful unless you're fighting off three vampires that were huddled together. 
THOR I really wish I had my hammer. 
KORG Hammer? BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                48. 
THOR Quite unique. It was made from this special metal from the heart of a dying star. And when I spun it really, really fast it gave me the ability to fly. 
KORG You rode a hammer? 
THOR No, I didn't ride the hammer. 
KORG The hammer rode you on your back? 
THOR No. I used to spin it really fast, and it would pull me off the... 
KORG Oh my God.     The hammer pulled you off? 
THOR The ground. It would pull me off the ground, up into the air, and I would fly. Every time I threw it, it would always come back to me. 
KORG Sounds like you had a pretty special and intimate relationship wiht this hammer and that losing it was almost comparable to losing a loved one. 
THOR That's a nice way of putting it. 
Thor spots S142 dealing at the bar.    He's once again eyeing the fob device clipped to her belt.    Scowls. 
SCRAPPER #142 I said they're mine. 
THOR See her, the one that put me in here. 
KORG Yeah, Scrapper 142. She's strong. And she drinks a lot. (MORE) BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16             49. 
KORG (CONT'D) Gotta watch out for those Asgardians, man. They are hard to perish. 
THOR Asgardian? 
Thor breaks away from the line and runs to S142. 
THOR (CONT'D) Hey!   Hey! 
S142 holds up the fob. 
THOR (CONT'D) Do not zap me with that thing. I just wanna talk. Asgard is in danger. 
Thor then notices a series of PATTERNED SCARS, or BRANDS, on her forearms. It's a moment of recognition and disbelief. 
THOR (CONT'D) My God, you're a Valkyrie. I used to wanna be a Valkyrie when I was younger...until I found out that you were all women. There's nothing wrong with women, of course. I love women. Sometimes a little too much. Not in a creepy way, just more of a respectful appreciation. I think it's great that there is an elite force of women warriors. It's about time. 
SCRAPPER #142 Are you done? 
WARDEN (O.S.) Lord of Thunder, you're up. 
THOR Please, help me.     I need your help. 
SCRAPPER #142 Bye. 
THOR Fine, then you must be a traitor or a coward because the Valkyrie are sworn to protect the throne. 
S142 finally turns her attention to Thor, intense. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                 50. 
SCRAPPER #142 Listen closely, your majesty. This is Sakaar, not Asgard. And I'm a scrapper, not a Valkyrie. 
Guards swarm Thor, dragging him back 
WARDEN (O.S.) Bring him in for processing! 
VALKYRIE And no one escapes this place. So you're gonna die anyway. 
Despite her denial, Thor has clearly hit a nerve. And from now on we will refer to Scrapper #142 as VALKYRIE. 
Valkyrie takes her booze and walks away. Thor is dragged away, passing Korg and the other prisoners. 
40A   INT. PROCESSING ROOM - DAY                                        40A 
Thor is strapped to a chair. Reveal a weird alien BARBER (Stan Lee cameo) holding up some rusty shears. 
THOR Hey, big guy. The sun's getting real low. 
Hulk takes off his helmet.   Scowling.   Teeth GRINDING. 
THOR (CONT'D) That's it. The sun's going down. I won't hurt you anymore. No one will. 
WHOOSH! Thor is suddenly dragged out of frame. Hulk has Thor by the leg and is WHIPPING him against the arena floor. Over and over and over again. 
IN THE VIP BOX: Loki's whole mood shifts. The joy returns to his face, like "everything will be alright!" Loki LAUGHS. 
LOKI Yes! That's how it feels! (to Grandmaster:) I'm just a huge fan of the sport. 
Thor is SMASHED into the floor face first. 
Hulk ROARS and RUSHES Thor with his axe. 
THOR All right. Screw it. 
CLANG! The giant weapons CLASH! Now Thor and Hulk are fighting warhammer versus battleaxe... 
...and Thor is winning! He's getting the better of these exchanges, using Hulk's aggression against him. Thor continually KNOCKS and/or TRIPS Hulk off his feet while evading all of Hulk's best attacks. 
THOR (CONT'D) I know you're in there, Banner. I'll get you out! 
One particular vicious blow DISARMS Hulk, and Thor BREAKS Hulk's axe with the warhammer. Thor then BASHES Hulk in the chest, KNOCKING him to the ground. 
THOR (CONT'D) What's the matter with you? You're embarrassing me! I told them we were friends! BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                   55. 
GROWLING, Hulk stands up and HITS Thor with a straight jab that sends Thor TUMBLING across the arena. Hulk immediately LEAPS after him and LANDS ON Thor! 
Hulk is now on top of Thor as they slide across the arena, just PUMMELING him with punches. Left-right-left-right. Thor's head snaps back and forth. 
In the carnage, Thor sees VISIONS OF ODIN.   Then- 
-his eyes GLOW WHITE WITH ELECTRICITY. Like an instinctual defense mechanism, Thor suddenly KNOCKS HULK BACK WITH A BURST OF LIGHTNING! 
Seething with electricity, Thor springs to his feet and then BLASTS HULK WITH A MASSIVE LIGHTNING PUNCH! Hulk is LAUNCHED BACKWARDS and Thor hits the ground HARD. 
CROWD Thunder! Thunder! Thunder! 
KORG Thunder! Thunder! Thunder! 
The crowd gets hushed.   They've never seen this before. 
IN THE VIP BOX: Grandmaster is pissed.   Loki is amazed. 
Hulk and Thor stagger to their feet. Thor looks at himself, a little surprised. There are still small charges of lightning CRACKLING through his veins. 
Meanwhile, Hulk RUMBLES towards Thor and they're at it again, close-quarters boxing. Thor is winning the exchanges, landing BRUTAL PUNCHES to Hulk's body. And then suddenly- 
-BZZZ! The Grandmaster ZAPS him with the Obedience Disk fob! Thor drops, totally caught off guard! 
Hulk plants his feet and JUMPS! He ZOOMS UP, rocketing out of the arena, up-up-up into the sky! At the apex of his jump Hulk clenches his fist and begins a missile-like descent. 
Val sees this from her ship and decides to take off, like "This fight is over, time to beat traffic." 
KORG (CONT'D) Another day, another Doug. 
Down below, Thor groggily turns over. He does so just in time to see Hulk coming at him like an atom bomb! 
No time to avoid it. KA-BOOM!!! Right before impact Thor's eyes go lightning white. Hulk HITS Thor like a meteor. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                  56. 
The impact knocks Thor unconscious and we CUT TO BLACK. Linger on darkness for a few beats...and then: 
36   INT. THRONE ROOM - SUNSET                                       36 
Hela sits on the throne trying to get comfortable, headdress & cowl off. Skurge stands at the foot of the throne. 
HELA What is that noise? 
SKURGE The common folk aren't exactly falling in line. There's a resistance trying to knock down the front gates. 
Hela sends her BUTCHER TROOPS to deal with it. 
HELA Tell me about yourself, Skurge. 
SKURGE Well, me dad was a stonemason, me mum was- 
HELA (interrupts) I'll just stop you there. What I meant was what is your ambition? 
SKURGE I just want a chance to prove myself. 
HELA Recognition. (then:) When I was young every great King had an executioner. Not just to execute people, but also to execute their vision. But mainly to execute people. Still a great honor. (beat) I was Odin's executioner. 
Hela holds out her hand and uses her powers to FORM A DOUBLE- SIDED OBSIDIAN AXE, which she offers to Skurge. 
HELA (CONT'D) And you will be my executioner. Let's begin our conquest. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                  57.

Hela and Skurge arrive at the Observatory, army in tow. 
HELA Skurge, where's the sword? 
Reveal that the Bi-Frost sword is missing. 
HELA (CONT'D) That sword is the key to opening the Bi-Frost. 
HULK Quinjet. 
Thor sees the Quinjet in a massive alien junkyard. 
THOR Yes! I'm getting us out of here. This is a terrible, awful place. You're gonna love Asgard. It's big. It's golden. Shiny. 
Hulk sits on his bed, eating a pumpkin. 
HULK Hulk stay. 
THOR No, no, no. My people need me to get back to Asgard. We must prevent Ragnarok. 
HULK Rag-na-ruh? 
THOR The prophesied death of my home world, the end of days, it's the end of- (Hulk's blank stare) If you help me get back to Asgard, I can help you get back to Earth. 
HULK Earth hate Hulk. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16     61. 
THOR Earth loves Hulk. They love you. You're of the Avengers. One of the team, one of our friends. This is what friends do. They support each other. 
HULK You're Banner's friend. 
THOR I'm not Banner's friend. I prefer you. 
HULK Banner's friend. 
THOR I don't even like Banner. (bad impersonation) "I'm into numbers and science and stuff." 
HULK Thor go. Hulk Stay. 
THOR Fine. Stay here. Stupid place. It's hideous, by the way. The red, the white. Just pick a color. 
Thor heads for the exit, a wide open door. 
HULK Smash you. 
THOR You didn't smash anything. I won that fight 
HULK I smashed you. 
THOR Yeah, sure, sure. 
HULK Baby Arms. 
THOR What? 
HULK Baby. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                       62. 
THOR Moron!   You big child. 
Thor heads to the open entrance.      Hulk smiles, anticipating. 
HULK Thor go! 
THOR I am going. 
ZAP! Thor's jolted back by the obedience disk.       There are perimeter sensors in the doorway. 
Hulk CHUCKLES at Thor as he hits the floor.      Points. 
HULK Thor go again! (then:) Thor home. 
TIME CUT: 
Thor slumps against the wall, head sagging. 
Hulk grabs his giant battleaxe.       He's armored up. 
HULK (CONT'D) Hulk trains. 
THOR That's great. Have fun. 
Hulk exits. Thor watches him go. Then, at the end of the hallway Hulk meets up with Valkyrie! They begin play- fighting, a clearly friendly rapport. 
Thor can't believe it. He runs to the entrance, but by the time he reaches the perimeter sensors they are gone. 
Thor sighs. Walks over to the window. Looks up through a wormhole, stars twinkling on the other end of it. 
THOR (CONT'D) A57               Heimdall, I know you can see me.                           A57 
Thor continues his plea at the window. 
THOR (CONT'D) I need you to help me. Help me see. 
Pause. Then Thor's eyes go golden like Heimdall's!         The stars in the wormhole begin to WARP OVER THOR AND- BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                   63. 
AA57   INT. STREETS OF ASGARD - SAME                                    AA57 
Thor suddenly finds himself in Asgard. Disoriented at first, Thor turns to see Heimdall hiding in the shadows. 
Heimdall harshly SHUSHES Thor and gestures for him to get up against the wall. Thor complies. Sees the refugees. 
After a beat a roving patrol of Hela's Butchers creep by through the street. They don't spot our heroes. Pause. 
Heimdall turns to Thor, speaks only in hushed whispers. 
HEIMDALL I see you. But you are far away. 
THOR What's going on here? 
HEIMDALL Come see for yourself. 
Without warning, Heimdall leads the family out of the alley and DASHES down the street. Thor follows... 
Hulk gets sad.   Wanders over to his bed to mope. 
Thor realizes he went to far.    Joins Hulk on the bed. 
HULK No. 
THOR I'm sorry I said those things. You're not the stupid Avenger. Nobody calls you the stupid Avenger. 
HULK It's okay. 
THOR You just can't go around throwing shields at people. Could have killed me. 
HULK I know. I'm sorry.     I just get so angry all the time.    Hulk always, always angry. 
THOR I know. We're the same, you and I. We're just a couple of hot-headed fools. 
HULK Yeah, same. Hulk like fire, Thor like water. 
THOR We're kind of both like fire. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                67. 
HULK But Hulk like real fire. Hulk like raging fire. Thor like smoldering fire. 
THOR Hulk, I need you to do something for me. 
TIME CUT:   Morning. 
BA-BOOM! BA-BOOM! BA-BOOM! 
We follow Two Palace Guards as they enter Hulk's Suite. 
Hulk is throwing a LARGE BALL against the far wall. It's so hard it makes dents in the wall. Hulk stops and turns. 
Reveal that the guards are escorting Valkyrie. They leave... Valkyrie and Hulk face off. 
HULK Angry girl! 
Val bounds forward and gives The Incredible Hulk a big hug. Hulk laughs and then begins playfully roughhousing with Val. 
VALKYRIE What's going on? What do you...? 
Hulk steps away, allowing Valkyrie to see Thor. Her smile disappears. She stares at Hulk, so annoyed. Hulk mopes a little. Like, "I done bad." Turns back to Thor: 
VALKYRIE (CONT'D) You're so thick-headed that you can't tell when someone's hiding all the way across the universe and wants to be left alone? 
THOR We need to talk. 
VALKYRIE No, you want to talk to me. 
Valkyrie turns to leave. 
THOR (to Hulk:) I need her to stay. 
Valkyrie is at the exit when the UPPER JAWBONE of Hulk's massive skull bed CRASHES into frame, BLOCKING the doorway. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                  68. 
Val shoots an annoyed sneer at Hulk.   Hulk SNORTS back. 
HULK Stay!    Please? 
Valkyrie looks him up and down. Obedience Disks to the max. 
Hulk begins BOUNCING his ball against the wall again. 
Valkyrie walks over to Hulk's bar, picks up an UNOPENED BOTTLE of liquor. Hulk snorts, disapprovingly. Val puts it down and finds something cheaper, she pops the cork. 
VALKYRIE All right. Here's the deal. I'll listen to you till this is empty. 
She TIPS BACK the bottle and starts CHUGGING. 
THOR Asgard is in danger and people are dying. We need to get back there. I need your help...wow. 
VALKYRIE Finished. Bye. 
She has indeed finished. She goes to leave. 
THOR Odin is dead. 
Valkyrie stops short (the BALL BANGING noise continues). Her silence speaks volumes. Thor has a realization. 
THOR (CONT'D) Hela, the Goddess of Death has invaded Asgard. 
VALKYRIE If Hela's back then Asgard is already lost. 
THOR I'm going to stop her. 
VALKYRIE Alone? 
THOR Nope. I'm putting together a team. It's me, you, and the big guy. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                   69. 
HULK No team.   Only Hulk. 
THOR It's me and you. 
VALKYRIE I think it's only you. 
THOR Wait. Just listen. The Valkyrie are legend, elite warriors of Asgard. You are sworn to defend the throne. 
VALKYRIE I'm not getting dragged into another one of Odin's family squabbles. 
THOR What's that supposed to mean? 
VALKYRIE Your sister. Her power comes from Asgard, same as yours. 
Hulk's ball rolls into frame. An off screen GRUNT.   Val picks it up and tosses it back to Hulk. 
QUINJET (V.O.) Access denied. 
THOR Damn you, Stark. (rolls his eyes) Point Break. 
QUINJET (V.O.) Welcome, Point Break. 
CAH-RUNCH! Hulk BARGES IN through the Quinjet door! 
The Hulk approaches, scowling. Any metal that stands in his way PEELS BACK. Frantic, Thor turns to the Quinjet's console. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16              73. 
HULK Friend stay! 
THOR No, no, no! 
As Hulk enters, he DESTROYS the hull of the Quinjet. 
HULK Stay! 
THOR Stop! Stop breaking everything! 
HULK Don't go! 
Thor triggers a message on the flight console. 
NATASHA (V.O.) Nice work, big guy. We don't know where Ultron's headed, but you're going very high, very fast. 
Hulk stops short.    His whole demeanor changes. 
Thor steps out of the way so that Hulk can see a recorded message from NATASHA ROMANOFF on the console. 
NATASHA (V.O.) ...So, I need you to turn this bird around, okay? We can't track you in stealth mode... 
Hulk is now right up against the console screen. 
NATASHA (V.O.) ...So I need you to help me out. Okay? I need you to... 
HULK No!     No, Banner! 
Hulk CONVULSES. Drops to his hands and knees. His whole body warping. Hulk ROARS and GRABS at his face, SHAKING his head, trying to fight this back. But he can't help it... 
...HE'S TRANSFORMING BACK INTO BRUCE BANNER! The transition is rough and chaotic, it's as if Banner is fighting to get out of the Hulk. Throughout the process, Hulk SMASHES back and forth, further WRECKING the Quinjet. 
And then, calm. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                 74. 
Thor rushes to Banner's side to help ease the transition. 
THOR Banner. Hey, hey, hey. You all right, Banner? Sun's going down. Sun's going down. That's it, breathe. I won't hurt you. Sun's going down. 
BANNER ...Thor? 
THOR Yeah. 
Banner is groggy, disoriented. Thoughts, memories, and observations begin to flood his brain randomly. 
BANNER What happened to your hair? 
THOR Some creepy old man cut it off. 
BANNER It looks good. 
THOR Thanks. 
BANNER Where are we? How's Nat? 
THOR Nat is good, I'm sure. 
BANNER And what about Sokovia? 
THOR Sokovia? 
BANNER The city, Sokovia.   Did we save it? 
THOR Banner, listen. 
BANNER What? 
THOR Sokovia. Ultron.     That was two years ago. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                75. 
BANNER What are you saying? I've been Hulk for two years? 
THOR I'm afraid so. 
Banner's eyes BULGE.    Trying to process this information. 
BANNER What the hell happened? 
Banner rushes to his feet.      Thor follows. 
THOR Banner, there's something you should know... 
Banner goes to the flight console. 
QUINJET (V.O.) Voice Activation required. 
BANNER Banner. 
QUINJET (V.O.) Welccome, Strongest Avenger. 
THOR (puzzled) What? 
BANNER Ship's log... 
THE SHIP'S LOG POPS UP ON SCREEN. 
THOR He's a friend. 
BANNER Who?    Me?    I'm Bruce. 
As Val leads them into Sakaarian apartment building.

A73   INT. SAKAARIAN BUILDING - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS               A73 
Continue down the hallway. 
VALKYRIE Look, I've spent years in a haze trying to forget my past. Sakaaar seemed like the best place to drink and forget and to die one day. 
THOR I was thinking that you drink too much, and that probably was going to kill you. 
VALKYRIE I don't plan to stop drinking, but I don't want to forget. I can't turn away anymore. So, if I'm donna to die, well... it may as well be driving my sword through the heart of that murderous hag. 
THOR Good. 
They arrive at a door.     Before they enter: 
VALKYRIE Yeah. So I'm saying that I wanna be on the team. Has it got a name? 
THOR Yeah, it's called the Revengers. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16               87. 
VALKYRIE Revengers? 
THOR Because I'm getting revenge. You're getting revenge. (to Banner:) Do you want revenge? 
BANNER I'm undecided. 
THOR Okay. 
VALKYRIE Also, I've got a peace offering. 
73   INT. VALKYRIE'S APARTMENT - DAY                                 73 
Valkyrie opens the front door, revealing- 
-Loki! He is as restrained as anyone could be, sitting in the middle of the apartment with a dozen chains around him. 
LOKIE Surprise. 
Thor TOSSES a bottle.    It BOUNCES off of Loki's head. 
LOKI OW! 
THOR Just had to be sure. 
LOKI Hello, Bruce. 
BANNER So, last time I saw you, you were trying to kill everybody. Where are you at these days? 
LOKI It varies from moment to moment. 
Val's apartment is a shithole. Bottles everywhere, blood- spattered clothes in the corner, a knife in the wall, etc. 
Banner gives Thor a look like "she might be crazy."   Thor responds with a "No, she's cool" gesture. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                88. 
Val lays something on the bed. Unwraps it to reveal AN OLD ASGARDIAN SWORD. Thor's eyes go wide as she sharpens it. 
THOR Is that... a Dragonfang? 
VALKYRIE It is. 
THOR My God. This is the famed sword of the Valkyrie. 
VALKYRIE Sakaar and Asgard are about as far apart as any two known systems. Our best bet is a wormhole just outside the city limits. 
A nice clean wormhole outside the city. 
VALKYRIE (CONT'D) Refuel on Xandar and be back in Asgard in around 18 months. 
THOR Nope. We're going through that one. 
Thor points at the nightmare tornado wormhole over the ocean. 
VALKYRIE The Devil's Anus? 
BANNER Wait, whose anus are we going through? 
THOR For the record, I didn't know it was called that when I picked it. 
BANNER That looks like a collapsing neutron star inside of an Einstein- Rosen Bridge. 
VALKYRIE We need another ship.   That would tear mine to pieces. 
THOR She's right. We need one that can withstand the geodetic strain from the singularity. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                   89. 
Banner gives Thor a quizzical look. 
BANNER And has an offline power steering system that could also function without the on-board computer. 
VALKYRIE And we need one with cup holders, because we're gonna die. So, drinks! 
BANNER Do I know you? I feel like I know you. 
LOKI I disagree. Open communication was never our family's forte. 
THOR You have no idea. I've had quite the revelation since we spoke last. 
The door opens, revealing a bunch of guards. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                 93. 
Thor and Loki heft up two Sakaarian guns. 
THOR (CONT'D) Hello! 
LOKI Hi! 
Thor and Loki BLAST all the guards, moving to another door. 
LOKI (CONT'D) Odin brought us together, it's almost poetic that his death should split us apart. We might as well be strangers now. "Two sons of the crown" set adrift. 
A guard tries to ambush Loki through the door.   Thor TAKES OUT the guard. 
THOR Thought you didn't want to talk about it? 
79   INT. GRANDMASTER'S PALACE - ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS              79 
Thor and Loki are going up. 
LOKI Here's the thing. I'm probably better off staying here on Sakaar. 
THOR That's exactly what I was thinking. 
LOKI ...Did you just agree with me? 
THOR This place is perfect for you. It's savage, chaotic, lawless. Brother, you're going to do GREAT here. 
LOKI Do you truly think so little of me? 
Thor pauses, considers his brother.   Then: 
THOR Loki, I thought the world of you. I thought we were gonna fight side by side forever. But, at the end of the day, you're you, I'm me... (MORE) BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16               94. 
THOR (CONT'D) I don't know, maybe there's still good in you, but let's be honest, our paths diverged a long time ago. 
Loki is wounded by Thor's willingness to discard him.    Masks his feelings with: 
LOKI It's probably for the best that we never see one another again. 
Beat.   Thor pats Loki affectionately on the shoulder. 
Hold on Loki. Did Thor just get through to him? 
THOR That's what you always wanted. 
Beat.   Then: 
THOR (CONT'D) Hey, let's do "Get Help." 
LOKI What? 
THOR "Get Help." 
LOKI No. 
THOR Come on, you love it. 
LOKI I hate it. 
THOR It's great. IT works every time. 
LOKI It's humiliating. 
THOR Do you have a better plan? 
LOKI No. 
THOR We're doing it. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                   95. 
LOKI We are not doing "Get Help." 
80   OMITTED                                                          80 
82   INT. GRANDMASTER'S PRIVATE GARAGE - CONTINUOUS                   82 
Multi-tiered platforms with dozens of cool spaceships. 
The elevator doors open. Thor supports Loki's weight with Loki faking a fatal injury. 
THOR Get help! Please! My brother, he's dying. 
A small group of Sakaarian guards turn toward Thor and Loki. One guard aims his gun at them. 
THOR (CONT'D) Get help! Help him! 
Thor picked up Loki and flings him at the guards, knocking them down like bowling pins. Loki stands up and Thor steps to Loki's side. 
THOR (CONT'D) Classic. 
LOKI I still hate it. It's humiliating. 
THOR Not for me, it's not. 
THOR (CONT'D) Which one's the ship she told us to get? 
LOKI (points) The Commodore. 
The COMMODORE starship. Brand new, solidly built, sleek. 
THOR / BANNER WHAT?! 
VALKYRIE Grandmaster uses it for his good times, orgies and stuff. 
Thor and Banner look around. The CEILING has MIRRORS ON IT and the floor is covered in a Sakaarian PERSIAN RUG. 
BANNER Did she just say the Grandmaster uses it for orgies? 
THOR Yeah. Don't touch anything. 
CLUNK! CLUNK! CLUNK! More fire from behind. 
A89   INT. WARSONG SHIP - THE SAME                                    A89 
Val's ship is hit. She rotates the cockpit to face BACKWARDS and opens fire, taking out the attacking chase-ship. 
But now in Val's cockpit... Sparks. Smoke. Alarms. 
In the distance Val clocks the Grandmaster's Riot Ship raining terror down on the masses. A look of determination as she pops the HATCH above - her ship is now a convertible. 
89    EXT. SAKAAR - CONTINUOUS                                        89 
Meanwhile, Warsong ZOOMS out from under Thor's ship, still ACCELERATING. Val has turned her ship into a missile, and its trajectory is the Grandmaster's Riot Control Ship! 
Grandmaster is still taunting his former captives below when- 
-KA-BOOM! Warsong SLAMS into the Statesman, specifically the Grandmaster's projection! Enlarged Grandmaster stumbles, struggling to maintain his balance. 
Warsong EXPLODES while the Statesman is knocked off kilter and goes down for a hard landing in the market! BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                  100. 
90   INT. COMMODORE SHIP - CONTINUOUS                                 90 
Thor and Banner witness the fiery explosion of Val's kamikaze flight path! 
THOR No! 
Thor experiences a brief instant of heartbreak/devastation... 
...but then notices a spec coming out of the explosion. 
THWACK! Val hits the ship's windshield and grabs hold! Residual smoke wafting off of her. 
91   OMITTED                                                          91

Thor pilots the ship out of the city into the Wastelands as six Sakaarian fighter ships race after them in formation. 
The following dogfight will proceed across the Wastelands and then out over the Sakaarian Ocean. 
93   INT. COMMODORE SHIP - CONTINUOUS                                 93 
Val is still on the windshield. GUNFIRE! One of the pursuing ships WINGS the Commodore, causing it to LURCH. 
THOR Get inside! 
VALKYRIE In a minute! 
Val pulls herself up and then RUNS DOWN THE ROOF OF THE SHIP! 
Thor and Banner follow the THUMPING of her footsteps. 
94   EXT. COMMODORE SHIP - CONTINUOUS                                 94 
In full sprint, Val LEAPS OFF and- 
-LANDS HARD on the lead Sakaarian ship! Val begins TEARING into the enemy ship with her bare hands! 
95   INT. COMMODORE SHIP - CONTINUOUS                                 95 
Thor and Banner exchange a look.   Pause. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                  101. 
THOR I should probably go and help. 
Thor abruptly exits, leaving Banner at the ship's controls. 
THOR (CONT'D) Here, take the wheel. 
BANNER No. I don't know how to fly one of these. 
THOR You're a scientist.   Use one of your PhDs. 
BANNER None of them are for flying alien spaceships! 
96    EXT. THE SAKAARIAN OCEAN - CONTINUOUS                            96 
Thor LEAPS into the middle of this high-speed dogfight! 
These two superhuman Asgardians begin jumping between their pursuer's ships, taking out guns, engines, and pilots with their bare hands. It's spectacular and epic. 
Thor RIPS out an engine block and uses it to crush a pilot. 
Val DRAGS her blades down the entire underbelly of a ship before BACKFLIPPING to another. 
Back and forth they go, even passing each other mid-flight a few times. One by one the Sakaarian ships GO DOWN. 
A97   INT. COMMODORE SHIP - SAME                                       A97 
Banner is frantically STEERING the ship, doing his best to dodge all the incoming fire. He peels away and is followed by Topaz, who is in her own chase-ship. 
Banner notices a button with a little explosion icon. 
BANNER Okay, come on. There's gotta be a gun on this thing. That looks like a gun. 
Hela RAKES a black-clawed hand across Thor's face. In doing so, she RIPS OUT ONE OF HIS EYES! 
HELA (CONT'D) Now you remind me of Dad. 
119   EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE - SAME                                        119 
Asgardians CLASH with Hela's Butchers. 
Valkyrie keeps raining down fire on Fenris, but it is doing no real damage. Just pissing the wolf off. 
Fenris shakes off the bullets and resumes CHARGING. 
Heimdall sees Fenris charging and steps out in front of the refugees with his sword, preparing for the worst. 
120   INT. COMMODORE SHIP - SAME                                        120 
Valkyrie gives up shooting. 
VALKYRIE This stupid dog won't die! 
Banner looks down at the carnage below.      Makes a decision. 
He gets up and heads for the bay doors. 
BANNER Everything's going to be okay. I got this. You want to know who I am? 
VALKYRIE What the hell are you talking about? 
BANNER You'll see. 
Banner LEAPS out of the ship! BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                 112. 
121   EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                                 121 
Banner soars through the air. It's an awe-inspiring image as we follow Banner's trajectory downwards. His face is determined, arms churning, ready to Hulk out... 
...except it doesn't happen.     Worry washes over his face. 
SPLAT! Banner FACEPLANTS on the bridge, seeming to break every bone in his body. He looks dead. 
Pause. Fenris SNIFFS him curiously. We notice one vein on Banner's neck PUMPING GREEN. Then- 
-Banner suddenly EXPLODES UP as THE INCREDIBLE HULK, UPPER- CUTTING Fenris in the jaw! Hulk is now in a wrestling match with a beast four times his size - the two of them go TUMBLING into the water below. 
122   EXT. PALACE BALCONY - SAME                                       122 
Hela has Thor by the throat.     She lifts him up to look over the balcony's ledge. 
HELA You see? No one's going anywhere. (then:) I'll get that sword even if I have to kill every single one of them to do it. 
Thor looks down.   Distraught.   Heartsick. 
123   EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                                 123 
Val pilots the Commodore towards the battle on the city side of the bridge. Skurge's battlion of Butchers surge forward- 
-BOOM! Val LANDS the Commodore on top of them, SKIDDING across the bridge, CRUSHING the front line of the Butchers, and KNOCKING Skurge aside. The impact triggers the party function, setting off PARTY MUSIC and a FIREWORKS DISPLAY. 
Val emerges from the ship in full battle mode. Behind her, the Commodore FIREWORKS provide a spectacular HERO BACKDROP. She draws DRAGONFANG and smiles as Butchers begin swarming towards her. She is where she needs to be. 
Meanwhile, the Asgardians huddle together, packed so tight that some begin to fall off the side of the bridge, loved ones grabbing them and pulling them back up. There's no hope. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16               113. 
Heimdall FIGHTS off Butchers, but gets KNOCKED DOWN.   Just as it looks like he's about to take a killing blow- 
-BAM!   The Butcher is BLASTED. 
Korg steps into frame, holding the blaster! 
KORG Hey man.   I'm Korg.   This is Miek. 
Miek steps into frame, waving. 
KORG (CONT'D) We're going to jump on that spaceship and get out of here. Want to come? 
Heimdall is beyond confused, but then... a LOUD NOISE. Hela looks down to see- 
-EMERGING FROM THE THICK LOW-HANGING FOG IS LOKI! Resplendent in horns, arms spread wide, seeming to float towards the bridge like a mythical angel of mercy. 
LOKI Your savior is here! 
The fog dissipates around him, revealing that Loki's standing on THE GRANDMASTER'S SUPERCRUISER! For reasons that will become clear, we will henceforth call this ship THE ARK. 
And Loki is not alone. He's brought along all the prisoners from the Contest of Champions. Armed with gladiator weapons. The Ark slows to a stop at the middle of bridge. 
ABOVE: Even with Hela's hand on his throat, Thor can't help but smile at the sight of Loki. Hela however sneers. 
HELA That little shit. 
BELOW: Loki and the Sakaarian gladiators JUMP OFF the Ark and onto the bridge, joining the fight against Hela's forces. 
LOKI Did you miss me?    Everybody on that ship, now. 
The Asgardian refugees begin POURING onto the ark. The only way onto the Ark is a narrow plankway, so there is an immediate bottleneck effect - thousands of frightened people all pushing for a chance at salvation. It's mayhem. 
Loki walks through the crowd to Heimdall. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                  114. 
HEIMDALL Welcome home. I saw you coming. 
LOKI Of course you did.

Fenris has Hulk in his mouth, underwater.    Trying to drown the green goliath! 
Fenris' teeth PUNCTURE Hulk's skin.   He BELLOWS, THRASHING. 
Hulk winds up and SLAMS Fenris in the snout! 
Fenris snaps back, revealing that- 
-THEY'VE REACHED THE REALM'S EDGE! 
Fenris is knocked off, plummeting off of Asgard into space. 
Hulk grabs hold of the slippery rocks, desperately trying to climb back as water pours down on him.

Our heroes have drastically thinned down the herd of Butchers. 
It's pandemonium. The Ark's engines are deafening, but you can still hear the sound of terrified people SCREAMING. 
Thor helps Loki to his feet. 
THOR You're late. 
LOKI You're missing an eye. 
Valkyrie finishes off a handful of enemies, but then notices something. She WHISTLES to get the others' attention. 
VALKYRIE This isn't over. 
All around the bridge, our heroes look to see- 
-Hela arriving at the far side of bridge.   She is seething with power, a vision of death. 
Having just come out of this huge battle, they are all weary and nursing injuries. Loki and Val are hurting worse than Thor. 
Hela walks towards them.   Menacing and deliberate. 
Thor, Loki, and Val step forward to protect the Asgardians. They huddle together. 
THOR I think we should disband the Revengers. 
LOKI Hit her with a lightning blast. 
THOR I just hit her with the biggest lightning blast in the history of lightning. It did nothing. 
VALKYRIE We need to hold her off until everybody's on board. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                119. 
Thor looks at the people boarding behind him. 
THOR It won't end there. The longer Hela's on Asgard the more powerful she grows. She'll hunt us down. We need to stop her here and now. 
VALKYRIE What's our move? 
LOKI I'm not doing "Get help." 
Thor sees Hela approaching. He sees the palace behind her. He comes to a realization. 
THOR Asgard's not a place, it's a people. (then) This was never about stopping Ragnarok...it was about causing Ragnarok. (to Loki:) Go to the vault. Surtur's crown. It's the only way. 
LOKI (impressed) Bold move, brother. Even for me. 
Loki runs off, leaving Thor and Val to deal with Hela. 
THOR Shall we? 
VALKYRIE After you. 
Thor ATTACKS. They CLASH, kicking off this monumental confrontation. Hela manifests pitch black weapons to attack Thor, but Thor is conjuring powerful bolts of electricity with the same speed and ferocity. 
Just as Thor is surging with newfound lightning powers, Hela's powers seem to be enhanced as well. 
The battle is relentless and fast-paced. Thor is holding his own against Hela. Maybe they can win this thing. 
After several fearsome exchanges, Hela PUNCTURES his shoulder and then DARTS past him with startling speed. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                 120.

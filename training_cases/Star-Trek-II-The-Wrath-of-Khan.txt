Absolute quiet. SOUND bleeds in. Low level b.g. NOISES of Enterprise bridge, clicking of relays, minor electronic effects. We HEAR A FEMALE VOICE. 
SAAVIK'S VOICE Captain's log. Stardate 8130.3, Starship Enterprise on training mission to Gamma Hydra. Section 14, coordinates 22/87/4. Approaching Neutral Zone, all systems functioning. 
INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 
As the ANGLE WIDENS, we see the crew at stations; (screens and visual displays are in use): COMMANDER SULU at the helm, COMMANDER UHURA at the Comm Con- sole, DR. BONES McCOY and SPOCK at his post. The Captain is new -- and unexpected. LT. SAAVIK is young and beautiful. She is half Vulcan and half Romulan. In appearance she is Vulcan with pointed ears, but her skin is fair and she has none of the expressionless facial immobility of a Vulcan. 
SULU Leaving Section Fourteen for Section Fifteen. 
SAAVIK Project parabolic course to avoid entering Neutral Zone. 
SULU Aye, Captain. 
UHURA (suddenly) Captain... I'm getting something on the distress channel. Minimal signal... But something... 
SAAVIK Can you amplify? 
UHURA I'm trying... 
SULU Course change projected. 
UHURA It's an emergency distress call! 
SAAVIK On speakers! 
VOICE (filtered, breaking up) Imperative! Imperative! This is the Kobayashi Maru -- nineteen periods out of Altair Six. We have struck a gravitic mine and have lost all power... Our hull is... (breaks up, static) ... and many casualties. 
UHURA This is the Starship Enterprise. Your message is breaking up. Give your coordinates. Repeat -- 
VOICE Enterprise, our position is Gamma Hydra, Section Ten... 
SAAVIK In the neutral zone. 
VOICE Hull penetrated, life support systems failing. Can you assist us, Enterprise? Can you... 
Breaks up. 
SAAVIK Data on Kobayashi Maru! Tactical! 
Tactical on big screen. 
COMPUTER VOICE Subject vessel is third class neutronic fuel carrier, crew of eighty-one, three hundred passengers. 
SAAVIK Damn. (then) Mr. Sulu, plot an intercept course. 
SULU May I remind the Captain that if a Starship enters the zone -- 
SAAVIK I'm aware of my responsibilities, Mister. 
SULU (with a nod) ... Now entering the Neutral Zone...

3   INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE - ANOTHER ANGLE                       3 
COMPUTER VOICE Warning. We have entered the Neutral Zone... Warning... 
SULU Estimating two minutes to intercept. 
On screen: Enterprise approaches the stricken vessel. 
SAAVIK Stand by transporter room, ready to beam survivors, aboard. 
UHURA Captain, I've lost their signal! 
COMPUTER VOICE Alert. Sensors indicate three Klingon Cruisers, bearing 316, mark 4, closing fast. 
SAAVIK Visual! 
On screen we see the approach  of the Klingon vessels, they are dark and sinister. 
KIRK A no-win situation is a possibility every commander may face. Has that never occurred to you? 
SAAVIK ... No, sir. It has not. 
KIRK How we deal with death is at least as important as how we deal with life, wouldn't you say? 
SAAVIK (falters) As I indicated, Admiral, that thought had not occurred to me. 
KIRK Then you have something new to think about. Carry on. 
She stays at attention. 
BONES Wouldn't it be easier to put an experienced crew back on the ship? 
KIRK They'll learn. Galloping about the cosmos is a game for the young, doctor. 
He leaves. They look at each other. 
UHURA (offended) What is that supposed to mean? 
HOLD ON Saavik. 
5   INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THE SIMULATOR ROOM - DAY               5 
Kirk rounds the corner and sees Spock, leaning against the wall. 
KIRK (dry) Aren't you dead? 
Spock almost smiles. 
KIRK (continuing) I assume you are loitering here to learn what efficiency rating I plan to give your cadets. 
SPOCK I am understandably curious. 
They walk together. 
KIRK They destroyed the simulator room and you with it. 
SPOCK The Kobayshi Maru scenario frequently wreaks havoc with students and equipment. (dry) As I recall you took the test three times yourself. Your final solution was, shall we say, unique? 
KIRK (solemn) It had the virtue of never having been tried. 
SPOCK Yours was not a solution which would have occurred to a Vulcan mentality. 
KIRK So you said at the time. Speaking of which, your protg's first rare -- a trifle emotional -- 
SPOCK She's half Romulan, Jim. The admixture makes her more volatile than -- me, for example. 
KIRK Than you. Yes, I see that. By the way, thank you for this. 
He lifts the book. 
SPOCK I know of your fondness for antiques. 
KIRK (reads) 'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...' Message, Spock? 
SPOCK None of which I am consciously aware -- except, of course, happy birthday -- surely the best of times. 
Kirk looks around uncomfortably, overlaps: 
KIRK Hrummm... and where are you off to, now? 
SPOCK The Enterprise. I must check in before your inspection. And you? 
KIRK (shortly) Home. 
Spock studies him -- 
SPOCK Something oppresses you. 
They are old friends -- 
KIRK Something. 
He steps into a turbo elevator. The doors close as Spock watches, wiping the scene. 
6   EXT. DEEP SPACE - NEAR CETI ALPHA V                          6 
In f.g. is the U.S.S. RELIANT, an older, somewhat battered starship of the ENTERPRISE class, with a slightly different configuration. Reliant approaches an inhospitable-looking yellow planet: CETI ALPHA V 
CHEKOV'S VOICE Starship log, Stardate 8130.4. This report classified MOST SECRET. Log Entry by Commander Pavel Chekov, Duty Officer. Starship USS Reliant on orbital approach with Ceti Alpha VI in connection with project code name GENESIS. We are continuing our search for a lifeless planet which will serve as a suitable test site for the Genesis Experiments. This is the 16th planet we have visited, so far, no success. 
7   INT. BRIDGE OF RELIANT                                       7 
Well-aged and distinctive. The usual compliment of officers and crew. CAPTAIN CLARK TERRELL, about 45, soft spoken and in good shape, but somewhat laconic. 
The door slides open and Bones enters. He carries two packages, one of them wrapped in brown paper. 
KIRK (continuing) Bless me, doctor; and what beams you into this neck of the woods? 
BONES 'Beware Romulans bearing gifts.' Happy Birthday... 
With a flourish, he pulls out a bottle of blue liquid. 
KIRK Romulan Ale! Bones, you know this stuff is illegal -- 
BONES (broad) I only use it for medicinal purposes. Don't be a pring... 
KIRK (reading the label with difficulty) Twenty-two, eighty-three... 
BONES Takes the stuff a while to ferment. Gimme. 
He takes the bottle and pours; continues talking. 
BONES (continuing) Now open the other one. 
Kirk starts to obey. 
KIRK I'm almost afraid to. What did you bring me, contraband Klingon -- 
BONES More antiques for your collection -- Cheers! 
They drink. The package is opened: a pair of gold "Ben Franklin" half-glasses. (N.B.: Romulan Ale is an INSTANT DRUNK: both men react.) 
KIRK Cheers. Bones, these are... charming. 
BONES Four hundred years old. You don't find many with the lens still intact. 
KIRK Uh -- what are they? 
BONES For your eyes. For most patients of your age, I generally administer Retlax Five to restore flexibility of the lens. 
KIRK But I'm allergic to Retlax. 
BONES Exactly. Happy birthday. 
He toasts. Kirk is unsure how they work. 
BONES (continuing) Slide them down your nose. Now look at me over the top. And you read printed matter through the bottom. 
KIRK (reacts) Amazing! I don't know what to say -- 
BONES Say thank you. 
KIRK Thank you. 
An awkward silence. 
BONES Damn it, Jim, what the hell's the matter? Other people have birthdays. Why're we treating yours like a funeral? 
KIRK Bones, I don't want to be lectured. 
BONES What DO you want? Damn it, why isn't there a girl here? You know this has nothing to do with age. This is about you flying a goddamn computer console when you wanna be out hopping Galaxies. 
KIRK Spare me your notions of poetry, please. We all have our assigned duties and... 
BONES Bull. You're hiding -- hiding behind the rules and regulations -- 
KIRK And who am I hiding from? 
BONES From yourself, Admiral. 
Pause. Kirk pours another drink. 
KIRK Don't mince words, Bones; tell me what you really think. 
BONES (mild take) I'm your doctor and I'm your friend, Jim. Get back your command. Get it back before you really do grow old. Before you turn into part of this collection. 
They look at each other.

14   EXT. SURFACE CETI ALPHA V                                   14 
A YELLOW PLANET, in constant SWIRLING HURRICANE WINDS OF SAND. Terrell and Chekov materialize. Their VOICES, filtered, are hard to make out. 
CHEKOV Captain, we've got to get out of here -- now! Damn! Hurry! 
Terrell catches his urgency -- 
TERRELL But the child -- 
CHEKOV Never mind! Hurry! 
22   EXT. CARGO HOLD AIRBAY                                      22 
Terrell and Chekov emerge, helmeted, then stop dead. 
23   ANGLE - THEIR POV                                           23 
A RING OF SUITED FIGURES has them surrounded. 
24   INT. RELIANT - THE BRIDGE                                   24 
Mr. Beach, the duty officer, stands looking at Ceti Alpha V on the forward screen. 
BEACH Try again. 
KYLE Starship Reliant to Captain Terrell ... This is Lieutenant Kyle. Will you please respond, Captain... Captain Terrell, respond please. 
Nothing. 
BEACH (thinks) Let's give them a little more time. 
25   INT. CARGO HOLD - CETI ALPHA V                              25 
Terrell and Chekov are held by FOUR STRONG MEN. 
They seem to be waiting. One of the men is JOACHIM. 
Out of the airlock steps a tall masked figure. A moment of suspense as Terrell and Chekov watch, terri- fied. The mask is peeled back. 
CHEKOV (aloud despite himself) Khan! 
KHAN is startled by the recognition; comes over and examines Chekov and Terrell. 
KHAN (finally) I don't know you. But you. I never forget a face. Mister Chekov, isn't it? (wonderingly) I never thought to see your face again. 
TERRELL Chekov, who is this man? 
CHEKOV A criminal, Captain -- a product of the late 20th Century genetic engineering -- 
TERRELL What do you want with us? I demand -- 
KHAN (mild) You are in a position to demand nothing, sir. I, on the other hand, am in a position to grant nothing. What you see is all that remains of the ship's company and the crew of the Botany Bay, marooned here fifteen years ago by Captain James T. Kirk. 
TERRELL Listen to me -- you men and women -- 
KHAN Save your strength, Captain, these people have sworn to live and die at my command two hundred years before you were born. Do you mean he... (i.e. Chekov) ... never told you the tale? To amuse you, Captain? Never told you how the Enterprise picked up the Botany Bay, lost in space from the year 1996, myself and the ship's company in cryogenic freeze? 
TERRELL I've never even met Admiral Kirk -- 
KHAN Admiral? He didn't tell you how Admiral Kirk sent seventy of us into exile on this barren sand heap with only the contents of these cargo bays to sustain us? 
CHEKOV You lie! On Ceti Alpha V there was life, a fair chance to -- 
KHAN This is Ceti Alpha V! Ceti Alpha VI exploded six months after we were left here. The shock shifted the orbit of this planet and everything was laid waste. Admiral Kirk never bothered to check on our progress. It was only the fact of my genetically engineered intellect that enabled us to survive! On earth, two hundred years ago, I was a prince, with power over millions -- now, like Prometheus I have been left by Admiral Kirk to digest my own entrails. 
CHEKOV Captain Kirk was your host! You repaid his hospitality by trying to steal his ship and murder him. 
KHAN (moves closer) And I'll wager he never told you about his shipmate, the beautiful and courageous Lieutenant McGiver, who gave up everything to join me in exile. OUT OF LOVE. And see how Admiral Kirk requited her devotion -- She's dead as earth! 
The wind howls in the silence. When Khan turns, his eyes are filled with tears. 
KHAN (continuing) A plague upon you all. 
He recovers his poise and returns to them -- 
KHAN (continuing) You didn't expect to find me. You thought this was Ceti Alpha VI. Why are you here? 
They don't answer. Khan goes over to Terrell and, WITH ONE HAND, LIFTS HIM INTO THE AIR -- 
KHAN (continuing) Why? 
Terrell gasps, stays silent -- 
KHAN (continuing) No matter. 
He lets go; Terrell falls with a thud -- 
KHAN (continuing) You will soon tell me willingly enough. 
KIRK Permission to come aboard, Captain? 
SPOCK Welcome aboard, Admiral. I believe you know my trainee crew. Certainly they have come to know you. 
KIRK (dryly to Saavik) Yes, we've been through death and life together. 
Saavik stiffens slightly -- humor is not her forte. 
KIRK (continuing to Scotty) Mr. Scott, you old space dog. You're well? 
SCOTTY I had me a wee bout -- but Dr. McCoy pulled me through. 
KIRK Oh? A wee bout of what, Mr. Scott? 
Uncomfortable, Scotty exchanges a glance with Bones -- 
BONES Shore leave, Admiral. 
KIRK Ah. 
He stops before a BRIGHT-FACED FOURTEEN-YEAR OLD, stand- ing so stiff he looks like he'll break -- in an engineer's uniform. 
KIRK (continuing) And who is this? 
PRESTON (breathless) Midshipman First Class Peter Preston, engineers mate, SIR. 
A big salute. Kirk is amused, returns the salute. 
KIRK Your first training voyage, Mr. Preston? 
PRESTON Yes, SIR. 
KIRK I see. Well, shall we start with the engine room? 
He moves, followed by his staff. 
SCOTTY (eyeing his protg) I believe you'll find all in order -- 
SPOCK We'll see you on the bridge, Admiral. 
KIRK Very good, Mr. Spock. 
Kirk and party leave. CAMERA PUSHES IN ON SPOCK AND SAAVIK. 
SAAVIK He's not what I expected, Sir. 
SPOCK What did you expect, Lieutenant? 
SAAVIK (uncertain) He's very human. 
SPOCK We can't all be perfect, Saavik. You must control your prejudices and remember that as a Vulcan as well as a Romulan you are forever a stranger in an alien land. Around you are humans, and as a member of the Starfleet you are unlikely ever to escape their presence or their influence. You must learn to tolerance in addition to all else I have taught you. Tolerance is logical. 
Saavik is humbled. 
SAAVIK As always, my mentor. Company dismiss. 
33   INT. ENTERPRISE ENGINE ROOM - LOOKING DOWN                  33 
The inspection party dwarfed by the size. Silence as Kirk looks around, runs a finger for dust, etc. Scotty, his team and Preston, stand at attention. 
34   ANGLE - FLOOR OF ENGINE ROOM                                34 
FEATURING power room separated by glass from the rest of the facilities. Bones, Sulu, Uhura, and some train- ees watch as Kirk inspects one console, clearly the responsibility of the bursting Midshipman Preston. 
PRESTON (blurting) I believe you'll find everything shipshape, Admiral. 
KIRK (sternly puts him on) Oh do you? Have you any idea, Midshipman Preston, how many times I've had to listen to Mr. Scott on the Comm, telling me his troubles? Have you any idea the ribbing I've had to endure in the officers' mess to the effect that the Enterprise is a flying death trap? 
PRESTON (scandalized) Oh, no, sir! This is the finest engine room in the whole Star -- 
The repressed grins of the others, and a smile on Scotty's face tell Preston he's being had. He stops, confused. 
PRESTON (continuing) If the Admiral can't see the facts for himself, then, with all due respect, he's as blind as a Tiberion bat. SIR. 
Approving laughter. Kirk looks amused. 
KIRK Midshipman, you're a tiger. 
SCOTTY My sister's youngest, Admiral. Crazy to get to space. 
KIRK Every young boy's fancy. I seem to remember it myself. (brisk) Very well. Mr. Scott, are your engines capable of handling a minor training cruise? 
SCOTTY Give the word, Admiral. 
KIRK Mr. Scott, the word is given. 
SULU We are clear and free to navigate. 
SAAVIK Course heading, Captain? 
Spock turns inquiringly to Kirk. 
KIRK Captain's discretion. 
Spock digests this with a slight smile. 
SPOCK Mr. Sulu, you may follow your nose. 
43   EXT. THE ENTERPRISE (STOCK FROM FEATURE)                    43

45   INT. RELIANT BRIDGE                                         45 
Khan occupies the Captain's chair. We PULL BACK: the crew of the RELIANT has been replaced by Khan's fol- lowers in their odd-looking clothes. 
At the helm is Joachim, Khan's lieutenant. He is in the largest and brightest of Khan's group. Terrell sits in the First Officer's chair, Chekov at the Comm Console. Their behavior is normal, save for subtle hesitation, symptoms of their mind-controlled state. 
JOACHIM Steady on course. All systems normal. 
KHAN It's not much different from Enterprise. (beat) When I was a guest aboard her some years ago, Captain Kirk kindly allowed me to memorize her technical manuals. And now, Mr. Chekov, let us review: You say you have no details of Project 'Genesis' ? 
CHEKOV Beyond what I told you, sir, it is classified information. 
KHAN Umm. And would Admiral Kirk have access to such information? 
CHEKOV I would think so, sir. He's on the Fleet General Staff. 
KHAN Then to whom do you report directly regarding Genesis? 
CHEKOV To Doctor Marcus, the civilian director of the experiments on Space Laboratory Regula I. 
KHAN (thinks) I see. Helmsman? 
HELMSMAN Aye, sir. 
JOACHIM May I speak? We're all with you, sir, but consider: we are free, we have a ship and the means to go where we will. We have escaped permanent exile on Ceti Alpha V. You have proved your superior intellect and defeated the plans of Admiral Kirk. You do not need to defeat him again. 
KHAN He tasks me -- and I'll have him. I'll chase him round the moons of Nibia and round the Antares maelstrom and round perdition's flames before I give him up. (as no one speaks) Prepare to alter course -- for Space Station Regula I.

Huge and busy. Among the scientists going about their tasks are JEDDA, a Deltan; MARCH, thin intense; MADISON, black, easy going. They are all young and earnest. Carol and David huddle over a computer console. 
DAVID Does that about do it? 
CAROL I don't think there's another piece of information we could squeeze into the memory banks. Next time, we'll design a bigger one. 
DAVID Who -- 
Jedda at the Comm Console overlaps. 
JEDDA Comm-Pic coming in on hyperchannel ... It's Reliant. 
Carol moves forward as the others close in. 
CAROL On the screen, please, Jedda. 
Buttons punched; the screen ebbs, flows and crackles on. ON SCREEN is CHEKOV. 
CHEKOV ... come in, please. This is Reliant calling Regula I. Repeat. This is USS Reliant -- 
CAROL Commander, we are receiving. This is Regula I. Go ahead. 
CHEKOV Dr. Marcus... good. We're en route to you and should be there in three days. 
CAROL En route? Why? We weren't expecting you for another three months. Has something happened? (pause) Has something happened? Do you read us? 
CHEKOV (fractional pause) All went well. Nothing has happened. Ceti Alpha VI has checked out. 
Pleased reaction from the scientists. 
CAROL I still don't under -- 
CHEKOV We have received new orders. Upon our arrival at Regula I, all materials of Project Genesis will be transferred to this ship for immediate testing at Ceti Alpha VI. 
KIRK Lieutenant, are you wearing your hair differently? 
SAAVIK It is still regulation, Admiral. 
She reaches out and touches a button. The lift stops. 
SAAVIK (continuing) May I speak, sir? 
KIRK Lieutenant, self-expression does not seem to be one of your problems. 
SAAVIK I wish to thank you for the high efficiency rating. 
KIRK You earned it. 
SAAVIK I did not think so. 
KIRK You're bothered by your performance on the Kobayashi Maru. 
SAAVIK I failed to resolve the situation. 
KIRK There is no correct resolution. It is a test of character. 
SAAVIK May I ask how you dealt with the test? 
KIRK (amused) You may ask, Lieutenant. 
She stares. 
KIRK (continuing) That was a little joke. 
SAAVIK Humor... that is a difficult concept ... it is not logical... 
KIRK We learn by doing, Lieutenant. 
She's a laugh a minute. Kirk pushes the button; the elevator starts. 
KIRK (continuing) You want my advice? 
She studies him, considering. No doubt about it, the attraction is mutual and she has no idea how to handle it. 
SAAVIK Yes. 
KIRK Take the test again. 
The lift stops and the doors open. 
BONES Who's been holding up the damn elevator? 
He reacts to them. Saavik exits demurely. 
SAAVIK Thank you, sir. 
Bones enters and the doors close. Kirk studies the ceiling. 
BONES Has she changed her hairstyle? 
Kirk says nothing. 
BONES (finally) Wonderful stuff, that Romulan ale -- 
UHURA'S VOICE Admiral Kirk -- 
KIRK Kirk here. 
UHURA'S VOICE I have an urgent CommPic from Space Lab Regula I for the Admiral. Dr. Carol Marcus. 
KIRK In my quarters, Uhura. 
UHURA'S VOICE Yes, sir. 
Awkward silence. 
BONES It never rains but when it pours -- 
KIRK As a physician you of all people should appreciate the danger of re-opening old wounds. 
The elevator stops. Kirk leaves. The doors close. 
BONES (annoyed with himself) Sorry. 
53   INT. KIRK'S QUARTERS                                        53 
Featuring VIEW SCREEN: A scramble of interference and noise. A piece of Carol's VOICE breaks through now and again as we PULL BACK revealing a frustrated Kirk. 
KIRK Uhura. Can't you augment? 
SPOCK Like all living beings, Admiral each according to his gifts. The ship is yours. 
KIRK That won't be necessary: just take me to Regula I. 
SPOCK Excuse my presumption, but I do not agree. As a teacher on a training mission, I am content to command a Starship. If we are to go on actual duty, it is clear that the senior officer aboard must assume command. 
KIRK But it may be nothing; garbled communications. Why don't you... 
SPOCK You proceed from a false assumption. I am a Vulcan. I have no ego to bruise. 
Kirk smiles in bemused wonderment. 
KIRK You are going to remind me that logic alone dictates your actions. 
SPOCK I was going to remind you of nothing, least of all that which you know well. (pause) Your mistake, if I may be so bold, was promotion. Commanding a Starship is your first best destiny. Anything else is a waste of material. 
KIRK I would not presume to debate you. 
SPOCK That is wise. In any case, were I to invoke logic, logic clearly dictates that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. 
KIRK Or the one. 
Spock inclines his head. 
SPOCK You are my superior officer. You are also my friend. I have been and always shall be yours. 
Kirk is moved. He starts to speak, can't -- finally: 
KIRK Will you accompany me to the bridge? 
SPOCK I'd best talk with Mr. Scott, first so that he may, in his own words, explain the situation to his cadets. 
Kirk's face tells us the wisdom of Spock's choice. 
58   EXT. SPACE STATION REGULA I                                 58

59   INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE                                      59 
Featuring Spock and Uhura, as she keeps trying -- 
UHURA ... Again, this is Enterprise calling Space Lab Regula I. Come in, please. Dr. Marcus. Please respond, please -- it's no use; no response from Regula I. 
SPOCK But no longer jammed? 
UHURA No, sir. No nothing. 
Spock considers, moves to Kirk. 
SPOCK There are two possibilities, sir they are unwilling to respond, they are unable to respond. 
KIRK How far? 
SPOCK Twelve hours and forty-three minutes, present speed. 
KIRK Give up Genesis, she said. What in God's name does that mean? Give it up to whom? 
SPOCK It might help my analysis if I knew what Genesis was. 
Kirk looks at him, nods; rising now. 
KIRK Uhura, ask Dr. McCoy to join us in my quarters. Mr. Saavik, take the con. 
They start for the Turbo Lifts as Saavik reacts --

BONES I've got the sick bay ready. Will someone please tell me what is going on? 
KIRK (dims lights) Computer. Request security procedure and access to Project Genesis Summary. 
COMPUTER VOICE Identify for retina scan. 
KIRK Kirk, Admiral James T., Starfleet General Staff. Security Class 1. 
The screen is suddenly busy with coded read-outs and then computer graphics of retina patterns. Then it glows green. SECURITY CLEARANCE, CLASS 1 GRANTED. 
KIRK (continuing) Summary, please. 
More coded read-outs, a red line SECURITY SCAN, then over it APPROVED, in green. Replaced by: 
UHURA Enterprise to Reliant. Come in, Reliant. 
KIRK Picture, Mr. Saavik.

KHAN (almost sing-song with joy) Slow to one-half impulse power. Let's be friends... 
HELMSMAN Slowing to one-half impulse. 
JOACHIM They're requesting visual communications, sir. 
KHAN Let them eat static. 
JOACHIM They're still running with shields down. 
KHAN Of course. We're one big happy fleet. Ah, Kirk, my old friend, do you know the Klingon proverb that tells us revenge is a dish that is best served cold? (pause) It is very cold in space. 
72   INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE                                      72 
SULU Reliant in our section this quadrant, sir, and slowing -- 
KIRK Visual. 
Visual of Reliant appears. 
SAAVIK Sir, may I quote General Order 12: 'On the approach of any vessel, when communications have not been est -- 
SPOCK Lieutenant, the Admiral is aware of the Regulations. 
SAAVIK Aye, sir. 
KIRK (watches the screen) This is damned peculiar. (beat) Yellow alert. 
SAAVIK Energize defense fields. 
ALARMS SOUND. The lights on the bridge dim into the soft reddish glow of battle illumination. ADDITIONAL CREW troop in to man vacant consoles. 
UHURA I'm getting a voice message... wait ... short range band. They say their Chambers coil is shorting their COMM system. 
KIRK Spock? 
SPOCK Scanning... 
He steps to his station.

74   INT. RELIANT BRIDGE                                         74 
JOACHIM They still haven't raised their shields. 
Khan is half out of his seat, sweating with anticipation. 
KHAN Careful: Not all at once. The engine room. Lock on target and prepare to fire. 
JOACHIM Locking phasers on target. 
Computer graphics monitor: Cross-hairs on Enterprise. BIG SCREEN (?) 
75   INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE - FAVORING SPOCK                     75

The firefighting continues. 
KIRK Scotty -- what's left? 
SCOTTY'S VOICE Just the batteries, sir. I can have auxiliary power in a few minutes -- 
KIRK We don't have minutes. Can you give me phaser power? 
SCOTTY'S VOICE A few shots, sir. 
SPOCK Not enough against their shields. 
KIRK Who the hell are they? 
UHURA Admiral... Commander Reliant is signaling. (a pause) He wishes to discuss terms of our surrender. 
There is a moment. Kirk looks around the battered bridge, and his eyes meet Spock's, and Saavik's. 
KIRK On screen. 
UHURA (hesitating) Admiral -- 
KIRK Do it, while we have time. 
All eyes go to the SCREEN. After momentary visual confusion, Khan's face appears, smiling -- 
KIRK (continuing; dumbfounded) Khan! 
SAAVIK Who? 
KHAN You still remember, Admiral. I cannot help but be touched. Of course, I remember you. 
KIRK What is the meaning of this attack? Where is the crew of the Reliant? 
KHAN Surely I have made my meaning plain. I mean to avenge myself upon you, Admiral. I've deprived your ship of power and when I swing round I mean to deprive you of your life -- 
88   EXT. SPACE                                                  88

89   INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE                                      89 
KHAN (on screen) -- But I wanted you to know first who it was who had beaten you: I, Khan Noonian Singh, the eagle you attempted to cage forever. 
KIRK Khan, listen to me -- if its me you want, I'll have myself beamed aboard. All I ask is that you spare my crew. 
KHAN That is a most intriguing offer. Typical, I must say of your sterling character. Let me think. 
90   EXT. SPACE                                                  90

91   INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE                                      91 
KHAN (on screen) I make you a counter-proposal, I will agree to your terms, if in addition to yourself, you turn over to me all data and material regarding the project called Genesis. 
Reactions from Spock and Kirk. 
KIRK Genesis, what's that? 
KHAN Don't play with me, Kirk, my hand is on the phaser control -- 
KIRK Give me some time to recall the data on our computers -- 
KHAN I give you sixty seconds, Admiral. 
Kirk turns from the screen -- 
SPOCK Admiral, you can't give him Genesis... 
KIRK At least we know he hasn't got it. Just keep nodding as though I'm giving orders. Saavik, punch up the data charts of Reliant's command console -- hurry... 
SAAVIK Reliant's command... 
KIRK HURRY. 
SPOCK The prefix code? 
KIRK It's all we've got. 
KIRK Captain Spock, if you do not hear from us within one hour your orders are to restore what power you can, take the Enterprise to the nearest Star Base and alert Starfleet command when you are out of jamming range. 
UHURA'S VOICE Sir -- we won't leave you behind...! 
KIRK Uhura, if you don't hear from us, there won't be anybody behind. Kirk out. (to Terrell and Chekov) You gentleman can remain here, or... 
TERRELL If it's all the same, Admiral, we'd like to share the risk. 
KIRK (hesitates) Very well. Let's go. 
BONES Go? Where are we going? 
KIRK (points to console) Where they went. Saavik. 
Kirk walks onto the pods as Saavik works the console, rolling in electronic coding. The others join Kirk. 
BONES But what if they went -- nowhere? 
KIRK Then this will be your big chance to get away from it all. 
SAAVIK Ready. 
She presses a button, joins them on the pods. Slowly they VANISH. 
123   EXT. SPACE - THE PLANTOID REGULA                           123 
CAMERA MOVES TOWARD it as the BEAM SOUND continues, with irregularity. The plantoid is ugly and dead. The sound frightens us, and climaxes with: 
124   INT. ROCKY CAVERN - REGULA                                 124 
The BEAM SOUND screeches, then settles into its comfort- able mode as the FIVE FIGURES FLUCTUATE, FADE, then APPEAR. They look around in wonder and relief. 
SAAVIK Admiral -- 
She indicates something O.S. They cross as CAMERA reveals a cave wall stacked with technical materials and crowned by a LARGE PROJECTILE, a giant version of the model we saw earlier. They stare. (N.B. FEATURE GENESIS ARMING CONTROL BOX.) 
BONES Genesis, I presume. 
They walk by a group of crates. It all happens very fast: David leaps out and tackles Kirk, throwing him to the ground and landing atop him, a knife at his throat. 
At the same time, Bones and Saavik reach for their phasers, but Jedda, already armed, steps out. He has them covered and helpless. 
125   ANGLE FAVORING DAVID                                       125 
DAVID You're the sonavabitch who committed mass murder up there. 
He raises the knife -- 
KIRK I'm Admiral Kirk... 
DAVID We were still there, you dumb bastard! We could hear the screams all the way to the transporter room -- 
Again he raises the knife -- 
KIRK Where's Dr. Marcus -- 
DAVID I'm Doctor Marcus! 
Carol reaches the tunnel entrance to the cave -- 
CAROL David -- 
DAVID Mother, go back! 
Carol sees Kirk -- 
CAROL Jim -- 
DAVID Go back. I'm going to kill him. 
CAROL (takes a breath) You do that and you'll have murdered your father. 
All react. David and Kirk, facing each other, are turned to stone. Bones, Jedda and Chekov turn to look at Carol, wondering. Terrell very casually takes the phaser from Jedda. 
126   NEW ANGLE (FORMERLY SCENE 134)                             126 
TERRELL (cool) I'll hold onto this. 
But Kirk and Carol ignore them and walk towards each other. There are tears in Carol's eyes. She reaches up, trying to smile and touches his hair -- 
CAROL You've got a little grey -- 
She can't. Kirk takes her and holds her tightly, look- ing at David, over her shoulder. He stands there, stunned, looking back. 
KIRK Carol. Is that true? 
142   INT. RELIANT BRIDGE                                        142 
Khan reacts to Kirk's VOICE: electronic shock. He clutches the communicator, his eye-whites rolling. 
KHAN Kirk! Kirk, you are still alive -- my old friend... 
INTERCUT AS DESIRED WITH 
143   ROCKY CAVERN - FAVORING KIRK                               143 
KIRK Still, 'old friend.' You've managed to kill just about everyone else, but like a poor marksman, you keep missing the target. 
KHAN (ironic) Perhaps I no longer need to try. 
He punches several buttons. 
In the Rocky Cavern the transporter beam locks on to the Genesis torpedo and its arming control box. 
As Kirk and the others watch, horrified, Khan beams up the materials. David tries to reach the torpedo, but Saavik holds him fast -- 
DAVID Let go -- he can't -- ! 
SAAVIK Only half of you would get there. 
The beam disappears and Genesis with it, leaving them alone. 
KIRK (desperate) Khan, you have Genesis, but you don't have me! You were going to kill me, Khan, it was your sole purpose. You'll have to come down here to do it! You'll have to come down! 
KHAN'S VOICE I've done far worse than kill you, Admiral. I've hurt you. And I wish to go on hurting you. I shall leave you, as you left me -- where no one will ever find you: poetic justice; marooned for eternity in the center of a dead planet -- buried alive. 
KIRK Khan -- ! 
KHAN Goodbye, Admiral. Oh, and don't count on Enterprise. She can't move. My next act will be to blow her out of the heavens. 
KIRK KHAN!

Khan closes his eyes in voluptuous satisfaction. Joachim enters and Khan looks at him. 
KHAN Well? 
JOACHIM Warp drive still inoperative. All other systems should be restored shortly. 
Khan sighs, contentedly. 
KHAN Excellent. We have all the time in the world. 
146   INT. ROCKY CAVERN                                          146 
As before, Saavik is on the communicator. 
SAAVIK This is Lt. Saavik, calling Enterprise... 
She keeps trying. Chekov stirs -- 
BONES He's alive! 
Bones goes and tends Chekov who moans, tries to sit up. 
KIRK Pavel? 
Chekov tries to smile; Kirk takes his hand -- 
SAAVIK No use, Admiral, they're still jamming all channels. 
BONES (looks across Chekov) It wouldn't make any difference. If Enterprise obeyed orders she's long since gone. And if she couldn't obey, she's finished. 
DAVID So are we, it looks like. 
CAROL I don't understand. Who's responsible for all this? Who is Khan? 
KIRK It's a long story. 
DAVID We appear to have plenty of time. 
BONES (dry) You and your father can catch up on things. 
DAVID (bitter) My father. I hope you realize another man has just been killed because of... 
BONES Because of you, son. You shouldn't have tried to rush someone holding a primed phaser. Anyway it isn't one man dead, it's two, in case you've lost count. 
David has been effectively spiked. Long silence. 
A huge cavern. Kirk is actually standing at the middle of it. Space extends vastly above and below his point of view. Like Eden, lush growth everywhere, water- falls, and a cobalt blue sky high, high above where a round orb glows sending light and warmth downward. There is a path from where Kirk stands down to the lower level where Bones, and the others are waiting and calling to him. Mist and haze waft gently across the cavern.

KIRK You did this -- in a day?! 
CAROL The matrix formed in a day. The life forms grew later -- at a wildly accelerated rate. Can I cook or can't I?

JOACHIM Impulse power restored. 
Khan smiles.

KIRK (continuing) Uh oh. 
SPOCK She can out-run us and out-gun us. But there is the Mutara Nebula at 153 mark four. 
KIRK (studies his console) Scotty, can we make it inside? 
SCOTTY The energizer's bypassed like a Christmas tree -- so don't give me too many bumps. 
KIRK No promises, Mr. Scott. On your way. 
SAAVIK Trouble with the nebula, sir, is all that static discharge and gas clouds our tactical display. Visuals won't function and shields will be useless. 
Kirk looks over the rims of his glasses at Spock; they smile with faint amusement. 
SPOCK What's sauce for the goose, Mr. Saavik. The odds will be even.

is devastated. Khan is blown from his chair and WE'RE UNCERTAIN of his fate. 
211   EXT. SPACE NEBULA            211 
Reliant, now a scarred, battered hulk, her main hull still intact, but dead in space. 
212   INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE                                     212 
No cheers, just deadly professionalism. 
KIRK Cease fire. Look sharp. 
SAAVIK Power levels quite low, sir. 
KIRK (to intercom) Mr. Scott, can you get the mains back on line? 
SCOTTY'S VOICE (breaking up slightly) I'll need ten minutes, sir, 'til the radiation dissipates. 
KIRK Uhura, send to Commander, Reliant: prepare to be boarded. 
UHURA Aye, sir. 
213   INT. RELIANT BRIDGE                                        213 
Amid the smoke and ruins, WE SEE no signs of life. 
UHURA'S VOICE Commander, Reliant, this is Enterprise. Surrender and prepare to be boarded. Repeat... 
In f.g., chillingly, Khan rises INTO SHOT by the main console. He is horribly burned, and it is clear that he is clinging to life by his will. 
KHAN No... Kirk. The game's not over. 
As Uhura's voice continues O.S., Khan pulls himself into a chair at the console, one of his hands useless at his side. 
KHAN (continuing) To the last I will grapple with thee! 
Painfully, with one good arm, he starts arming the Genesis console. 
213A   INT. RELIANT TRANSPORTER ROOM                             213A 
There sits the Genesis torpedo: lights start blinking in response. As we watch, the CHILD we met on Ceti Alpha walks to the torpedo and smiles at the lights. 
214   INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE                                     214 
UHURA Enterprise to Reliant: you are ordered to surrender your vessel. Respond! (to Kirk) Nothing, sir. 
KIRK (continuing) And yet, in the midst of our sorrow it should be noted that this death takes place in the shadow of new life, the sunrise of a new world, a world that our beloved comrade gave his own life to protect and nourish. He did not feel that sacrifice a vain or empty one -- and we will not debate his profound wisdom, in these proceedings. Of my friend, I can only say this, that of all the souls I have encountered in my travels, his was the most -- (he falters) -- human. 
He tries to go on, but catches Bones' face: Bones is streaming tears. Kirk can't go on. 
KIRK (continuing) Lieutenant Saavik.

241   ANGLE - THE GROUP                                          241 
Saavik steps forward. 
SAAVIK We commend the soul of our brother departed. We love we commit his body to the depths of space. 
SULU Honors -- hup! 
All Starfleet personnel salute. Scotty begins to PIPE, an odd blare which mellows into Amazing Grace. Kirk nods a signal. 
242   THE CAPSULE                                                242 
A gleaming black projectile is carried by pallbearers into the launching chamber, which locks behind it. At a hand signal from a TORPEDOMAN, the projectile is fired. NOISE. 
243   EXT. SPACE                                                 243 
Spock's remains seen on their way to the new world. The capsule grows too small to SEE. The bagpipes STOP. 
244   INT. TORPEDO ROOM                                          244 
SULU Return -- hup! 
The salute drop. 
KIRK Lieutenant. 
She steps to him and they exchange salutes -- 
KIRK (continuing; very quietly) After you dismiss the company, you will take the watch. Set course for Ceti Alpha V and we'll pick up survivors. 
SAAVIK Aye, sir. 
KIRK I'll be in my quarters if needed, but I would prefer... 
SAAVIK Understood, sir. 
KIRK (aloud) Dismiss the company. 
They salute. She about-faces as Kirk walks towards the  Turbo Lift. Saavik issues dismissal and posting orders, but WE TRUCK with Kirk until CAMERA STOPS and he leaves FRAME and WE HOLD on David. He finally understands. 
245   INT. KIRK'S QUARTERS                                       245 
After a long moment, the CAMERA DISCOVERS Kirk. He pours a drink, then decides not to have it. 
He sits wearily, not knowing how to shake the ghosts. Then he sees the book. 
Kirk picks up the battered volume, the gift from his friend, and closes his eyes a moment. Almost idly he starts turning pages, looking for a clue. But he can't see the writing -- he rummages through his pockets and pulls out the half-glasses -- 
One of the lenses is broken. It has a deep impact on Kirk. He puts down the book and glasses and covers his eyes. 
A SOFT BONG. Kirk clears his throat. 
KIRK Yes... come. 
The door whooshes open and closes to admit David. The last person Kirk expected to see. 
DAVID I don't mean to intrude. 
KIRK Uh, no... (rises) I should be on the bridge. 
DAVID Are you running away from me? 
David's strength is turning a corner with Kirk -- 
KIRK I suppose I was. (pause) I poured a drink. Would you like it? 
DAVID No. I -- I guess I'm not what you expected. 
KIRK (rueful) I didn't expect anything. 
DAVID That makes two of us. (he studies his father) Lieutenant Saavik was right: you never have faced death -- 
KIRK (hoarse) Not like this -- no. I haven't faced death, I cheated death. I tricked my way out of death and patted myself on the back for my ingenuity. I know nothing. 
DAVID You knew enough to tell Saavik that how we face death is at least as important as how we face life -- 
KIRK It was just words.

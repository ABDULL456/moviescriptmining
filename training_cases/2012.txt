OVER BLACK 
We listen to the immortal music of Mozart's Adagio of the Clarinet Concerto in A. 
FADE UP 
EXT. THE SOLAR SYSTEM 
Space, infinite and empty. 
But then, slowly all nine planets of our Solar System move into frame and align. 
The last of them is the giant, burning sphere of the sun. 
Just as the sun enters frame, a solar storm of gigantic proportion unfolds. The eruptions shoot thousands of miles into the blackness of space. 
FADE TO BLACK 
FADE UP 
EXT. COUNTRY SIDE/INDIA - SUNSET 
Mozart's concerto filters from a jeep's stereo, fighting the drumming sounds of the monsoon rain. PROF. FREDERIC WEST, 66, listens to the music. 
An Indian BOY playing by the roadside steers his wooden toy ship across a puddle. 
The Professor turns to his driver, pointing to the boy. 
PROF. WEST Watch out! 
But it's too late. The jeep drives straight through the puddle at full speed, sinking the boy's toy ship. 
In the background, the jeep stops in front of a building. The driver jumps out, leading the Professor towards its entrance. 
The sign at the door reads: `Institute for Astrophysics - University of New Delhi'. 
INT. NAGA-DENG MINE/INDIA - SUNSET 
An endless mine shaft. An old elevator cage comes to a grinding halt. When Prof. West steps out we see that he is accompanied now by a nervous DR. SATNAM TSURUTANI, 32. 
PROF. WEST How deep are we? 
SATNAM 8200 feet. Used to be an old copper mine, Professor, sir. 
As Prof. West follows Satnam, he takes in the unusual setting for this science lab. 
PROF. WEST Helmsley told me that the neutrino count doubled during the last sun eruptions. 
SATNAM Correct, sir. But that is not what worries me... 
They enter a large room with low hanging ceilings. A small group of WHITE COATS look up from their computers, which all show images of the solar storm we witnessed earlier. 
SATNAM (CONT'D) There was a new solar storm, so strong that the physical reaction got even more severe. 
PROF. WEST How can that be? 
SATNAM We don't know, Professor, sir. 
Satnam walks over into another room. There he opens a hatch on the floor and hot steam rises. 
SATNAM (CONT'D) The neutrinos suddenly act like... microwaves. 
Prof. West slowly steps closer. When he discovers that the water in the tank below is boiling, his face goes pale. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. LARGE TERRACE/WASHINGTON D.C. - EVENING 
A major fund raising party is under way. The setting is spectacular. A terrace overlooking the Washington Mall and the Capitol Building. 
ADRIAN HELMSLEY, 32, stands with a group of young POLITICAL AIDES. He is the only African-American among them. 
One of the aides spots CARL ANHEUSER, 58, White House Chief of Staff, working the crowd. 
POLITICAL AID #1 Look at Anheuser. Anyone would think he was President. Did you hear, he wants us to sign in and out like school boys? 
ADRIAN I still can't believe that Wilson chose him of all people to run the White House. 
POLITICAL AID #2 Why not? Anheuser owns the Senate and the Congress. 
ADRIAN Shame he's such a pompous ass. 
ANHEUSER (O.S.) Somebody mention my name? 
Adrian turns to see Anheuser smiling. 
ADRIAN (SHOCKED) Yes sir... No, sir. 
ANHEUSER Which one is it? 
ADRIAN We were talking about what a great speech you gave tonight. Well done, sir. 
ANHEUSER It's Helmsley, right? I'll remember that. 
Anheuser walks away with a dangerous smile. 
POLITICAL AID #2 That guy scares the shit out of me. 
At that moment Adrian's cell phone rings. (CONTINUED) 
ADRIAN (into the phone) Professor West? 
PROF. WEST (O.S.) I've been trying to reach you! 
INT. LIVING ROOM/SATNAM'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Prof. West is on the phone. In the background we make out Satnam's family around the dining room table. 
Eager hands fly up in the air. An official makes notes. 
COLONEL (CONT'D) Who can weld? 
Lin's hand shoots up in the air. We hear a siren echoing through the mountains and suddenly an explosion. Lin turns. 
In the BACKGROUND, a series of explosions punch enormous holes into the side of the mountain, showering rock everywhere. 
FADE TO BLACK 
(CONTINUED) 
FADE UP 
INT. DORCHESTER HOTEL/LONDON - DAY 
A MAN in a dark suit walks through a hallway of the Dorchester looking like your typical MI-6 agent. The decor is plush and luxurious. He's stopped by two security men who frisk him. 
INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE/DORCHESTER HOTEL - DAY 
Heavily ringed fingers flip through a folder. 
MI-6 OFFICER (O.S.) Has his Highness had the opportunity to study the dossier? 
A SAUDI PRINCE looks up and nods without expression. 
SAUDI PRINCE You must understand I have a very big family. Mister... 
MI-6 OFFICER Isaacs. 
SAUDI PRINCE Mister Isaacs, one billion dollars is a lot of money. 
MI-6 OFFICER I'm afraid the amount is in Euros, your Highness. 
CUT TO: 
INT. LOUVRE/PARIS - NIGHT 
A group of dark figures in overalls walk past famous Renaissance paintings. They stop at the Mona Lisa. 
MANFRED PICARD, 63, head of the French National Museums, stands by LAURA, a young African-American woman in her late 20's. They observe the specialists opening the case of the famous painting. 
A whoosh of air as the vacuum seal breaks. 
MANFRED PICARD Laura, I'm putting a lot of trust in your people. (CONTINUED) 
Laura answers in almost perfect French. 
LAURA There are too many crazy people who could hurt her, Manfred. The World Heritage Foundation has done this all over the world. 
In the BACKGROUND the Mona Lisa is taken off the wall and replaced with a perfect replica. Picard still looks uneasy. He watches as the real Mona Lisa is sealed into an airtight case. 
MANFRED PICARD And she'll be safe now? Tucked away in the Swiss Alps? 
LAURA Perfectly safe. 
Picard looks suspicious but says nothing. The CAMERA MOVES IN on the face of the fake Mona Lisa until all we see is her mysterious smile. 
FADE TO BLACK 
FADE UP 
FUZZY TV IMAGES: 
Lifeless bodies encircle a huge fire pit. They resemble the rays of the sun. In the background we see the famous step pyramids of Tikal. 
NEWSCASTER (O.S.) ... The mass suicide was discovered by a BBC documentary crew in the ancient Mayan city of Tikal... 
Many of the dead are women and children looking peaceful and are surrounded by colorful flowers. 
NEWSCASTER (CONT'D) ... the victims were said to have adhered to the Mayan-Quiche Calender which predicts the end of time to occur on the 21st of December this year, due to the sun's destructive forces... 
The CAMERA slowly pulls out and we are in-- 
INT. JACKSON'S APARTMENT/LOS ANGELES - EARLY MORNING 
A shabby apartment in Silverlake. The TV is on. 
NEWSCASTER (O.S.) ... Strangely enough, scientific records do support the fact that we are heading for the biggest solar climax in recorded history... 
A small tremor rocks the apartment and the dishevelled face of JACKSON CURTIS, 33, pops up from behind the couch. He fell asleep at his laptop last night. 
JACKSON Oh no. Not again. 
One look at his watch and he is off running. He throws some clothes and a toothbrush in a bag. His cell phone rings. 
JACKSON (CONT'D) Hello?... What do you mean? I'm not late. It's not even 10:30... 
Jackson turns off the TV and darts towards the door, stopping only to slide his laptop into a knapsack. As he turns, he stumbles over a stack of books, all shrink-wrapped and identically titled: `Farewell Atlantis'. 
JACKSON (CONT'D) Damn it! (into the phone) Kate, I'm on my way... For god's sake... 
Frustrated, he kicks them out of his way and exits. We hold on the books and realize that Jackson's photograph is on their back covers. 
EXT. JACKSON'S GARAGE/LOS ANGELES - EARLY MORNING 
The phone call continues as Jackson opens the garage door, struggling to pack his old SUV with camping equipment. 
JACKSON They're kids, Kate, going on vacation. It's not a doctor's appointment... it's supposed to be fun. You remember that, right? Fun? 
He tries to start the engine, but the battery is dead. Frustrated, he hits the steering wheel. 
EXT. JACKSON'S STREET/LOS ANGELES - EARLY MORNING 
Jackson runs across the street with his camping equipment, throwing it into the trunk of a stretch limo parked by the curb. 
JACKSON ... I know it's mosquito season at Yellowstone, Kate. I'll pick some up on the way. 
He notices a deep crack in the asphalt. His neighbors, an elderly couple, stand there and stare at it. 
NEIGHBOR Merrill, we should move back to Wisconsin. 
Jackson gets into the limo and speeds off. 
Jackson looks up, remembering he forgot the spray. 
JACKSON We'll get some of that tomorrow. For tonight just put your head under the blankie. 
LILLY Daddy you said you weren't gonna work on your book. 
JACKSON I'm not Honey, I promise. Are you wearing your pull-ups? 
Lilly nods as Jackson walks over and tucks her into bed. He kisses her good night. He turns and is surprised to see Noah typing a text on his cell phone. 
JACKSON (CONT'D) Did mommy buy you that? 
NOAH No... Gordon gave it to me for my birthday. 
Jackson takes the phone from out of Noah's hands. 
JACKSON Noah. Things like a cell phone have to be discussed in the family. 
NOAH (BITTER) What family? 
Jackson reads the message Noah has typed `Hey Gordon, Camping Sucks!'. Hurt, Jackson hands back the phone. 
JACKSON Go to sleep guys. 
EXT. RESEARCH FACILITY/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DUSK 
Commotion. The base packs up. Adrian and Prof. West duck low as they board a chopper. Adrian is on the phone. 
ADRIAN ... You have to immediately inform the President, Mr Anheuser. The readings look much worse than I expected. (MORE)                    (CONTINUED) 
ADRIAN (CONT'D) Plus Satnam's neutrino figures from India confirm... 
We hear Anheuser, yelling. 
ANHEUSER (O.S.) ... But you guys said... 
ADRIAN We were wrong! By five or six months... 
A second later the chopper lifts off. 
INT. LIMO/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DUSK 
Jackson has his laptop open with the cursor blinking away on the words `Chapter Seven'. But he can't concentrate on writing after what Noah has said. 
A chopper flies overhead. Jackson follows it's path over the campsite and his eyes fall on an American flag fluttering on top of a massive radio antennae. This belongs to an RV truck. 
Through the RV's window, Jackson sees the silhouette of Charlie Frost, the guy with the binoculars, speaking into a microphone. 
Curious, Jackson flicks on the radio and twists the dial. 
ON THE RADIO (Charlie's voice) ... We have a listener calling in. Bill from Cooke City, you're on the Charlie Frost Show. (Bill's voice) I wanted to know, where will this all start? 
Jackson is intrigued. He puts his laptop down. 
ON THE RADIO (CONT'D) (Charlie's voice) Well, something like this could only originate in Hollywood, Ha-Ha! But seriously, they've got the earth cracking under their asses already, Bill. 
Jackson climbs out of his car and starts towards the RV. He can still hear the radio. 
ON THE RADIO (CONT'D) (Bill's voice) Our family believes in the gospel of our Lord Jesus. (MORE)                   (CONTINUED) 
ON THE RADIO (CONT'D) We have nothing to fear, Charlie. (Charlie's voice) Good for you Bill, good for you! 
INT. CHARLIE'S RV/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DUSK 
Charlie hits a switch. Music starts playing. The Doors, `The End'. 
CHARLIE FROST ... This is Charlie Frost reporting live from Yellowstone National Park, soon to become the world's largest active volcano. 
Charlie is about to take a bite of his sandwich, when there's a knock on the door. Jackson sticks his head in. 
JACKSON Hi. Mind if I join you? 
CHARLIE FROST I only got a few minutes. 
Charlie bites into his sandwich as Jackson looks around at all the equipment. 
JACKSON I just heard part of your broadcast... Mind me asking a question? What exactly is it... that will start in Hollywood? 
CHARLIE FROST (CHEWING) Actually it's gonna be the whole west coast... 
JACKSON What are you talking about? 
CHARLIE FROST The apocalypse, the end of days. The Mayans knew it, the I Ching and the Bible, kind of... 
Charlie looks at his watch. 
CHARLIE FROST (CONT'D) I got to eat... Just check my blog. You can download it for free. 
Charlie clicks on his laptop. 
CHARLIE FROST (CONT'D) ... However, we do take donations. (CONTINUED) 
A crudely animated film starts to play. Charlie narrates on screen in an overly dramatic fashion. 
CHARLIE'S VOICE In the year 2012 a cataclysmic event will unfold. Caused by an alignment of the planets in our solar system that only happens every 640,000 years... Just imagine the earth as an Orange... 
Charlie appears as an animated figure holding an orange. 
CHARLIE'S VOICE (CONT'D) ... our sun will begin to emit such extreme amounts of radiation, that the core of the earth will melt - that's the inside part of the Orange, leaving the crust of our planet free to shift. 
On screen the middle of the orange shrinks, now the skin moves freely around it. 
CHARLIE'S VOICE (CONT'D) In 1958, Prof. Hapgood named it `Earth Crust Displacement'... 
A faded portrait of a scientist appears on screen. 
CHARLIE FROST ... and Albert Einstein endorsed it... 
The infamous photo of Einstein, sticking out his tongue. 
CHARLIE FROST (CONT'D) The forces of mother nature will be so devastating it will bring an end to this world on winter solstice 12-21-12. 
The film ends with an image of the whole earth covered with water. 
JACKSON What? 
The woman looks at Lilly and Noah with their red lumps. 
CASHIER I'd get before and after. 
She slams two mosquito products on the counter. 
LILLY (POINTING) Look! Mrs. Birnbaum, my teacher is on TV! 
On the store's TV: A heavy-set blonde WOMAN, 45, speaking to a reporter in front of Gelson's. 
NOAH That's our supermarket. 
The gap in the ground is enormous now, at least half a mile long and 200 feet wide. 
JACKSON (WORRIED) Kids, we have to pack up and go find mommy. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HALLWAY/WHITE HOUSE - MORNING 
President Wilson and Anheuser walk towards the Situation Room. 
(CONTINUED) 
ANHEUSER Sir, you have to initiate the boarding process immediately. 
PRESIDENT WILSON Is this even possible? What's our information from China? 
ANHEUSER They estimate four of the ships will be ready for launch. 
The President is shocked by this news. 
PRESIDENT WILSON Only four? 
ANHEUSER If it's alright with you sir, I'll brief the panel about the new development. 
PRESIDENT WILSON I'd rather have Adrian do that. They trust him. I told him to be in on the meeting. 
Anheuser fumes as they enter the situation room. 
INT. SITUATION ROOM/WHITE HOUSE - MORNING 
Flat screens line the walls. A video conference is under way with each of the G8 members represented. 
PRESIDENT WILSON Ladies and Gentlemen, we all knew this day would come. But we never imagined it would come this soon. 
He looks over to Adrian. 
PRESIDENT WILSON (CONT'D) I would like to pass this over to my science advisor, Adrian Helmsley. 
Adrian steps up and gathers himself. Anheuser watches. 
ADRIAN I'll make this brief... 
Pointing to a set of charts. 
(CONTINUED) 
ADRIAN (CONT'D) ... According to our latest data from Yellowstone, the temperature of the subterranean crust of the earth, the cement that holds our landmass in place, is increasing at a rapid rate, much faster than anticipated... 
All the heads of state are glued to his words. 
ADRIAN (CONT'D) ... This causes extreme polar instability. The magnetic fields have decreased by more than 80% over the last 48 hours. 
The German Chancellor, a woman, interrupts. 
GERMAN CHANCELLOR How much time do we have, Mr. Helmsley? 
Adrian glances to Professor West, standing in the back. 
ADRIAN Two, maybe three days if we're lucky. 
The Prime Minister of Italy breaks in, upset. 
ITALIAN PRIME MINISTER How can you speak about luck in such a situation? 
ANHEUSER Apologies Prime minster. He's still new to the job. 
President Wilson steps up. 
PRESIDENT WILSON Nevertheless, Mr. Antonioni, we have to make an immediate decision. 
We hear CHEERING and APPLAUSE. 
BOXING ANNOUNCER (O.S.) Introducing the 320 pound muscle machine from the Ukraine... 
CUT TO: 
INT. BOXING ARENA OF MGM GRAND/LAS VEGAS - NIGHT 
The arena is filled to its max. The crowd is on its feet. 
(CONTINUED) 
BOXING ANNOUNCER ... and tonight's challenger for the heavy weight world championship of the world. Here he is... Mister Zultan Balashin! 
The crowd ROARS as the boxer and his entourage enter. 
The CAMERA moves in on a tall man with blonde clean cut hair. He is well built, wearing designer clothing from head to toe. YURI KARPOV, 45, stereotypical Russian oligarch. 
He approaches the ringside corner and whistles. 
YURI Zultan! 
The nervous boxer turns. 
ZULTAN (in Russian) Ah, finally, Yuri. I thought I would not see you. 
Yuri hits the boxer's gloves. Zultan is nervous. His coach steps in. 
COACH He needs to concentrate now, Mister Karpov. 
JACKSON Are you guys blind? I can't run people over. 
OLEG Why not? They're idiots anyway. 
Jackson shoots these spoilt brats an angry look. 
EXT. SANTA MONICA AIRPORT/LOS ANGELES - MORNING 
Jackson stops in front of the Gulfstream. SASHA, 40, Yuri's Russian pilot is expecting them. 
SASHA Hey Jackson. Took you a while... 
Jackson mutters under his breath as he unloads the luggage, dropping one of them on Alec's foot on purpose. 
ALEC Ouch! Be more careful! 
The other twin has noticed Jackson's intensions. He gets into his face. 
OLEG Now you're laughing, Curtis. But we are going on a big ship. (PAUSE) We will live... and you will die. 
Oleg grins back at Jackson as the jet door closes. The Gulfstream taxis onto the runway. 
As Jackson turns back to the car a fine surface crack shoots across the tarmac. We hold on his face as it hits him like a ton of bricks: 
THE CRAZY RADIO HOST, CHARLIE FROST WAS RIGHT! 
Frantically Jackson looks around and spots a MAN in overalls working on a twin engine Cessna. He runs to him. 
JACKSON Where can I rent a plane? 
The man points to a shabby office building. 
CUT TO: 
INT. KITCHEN/LOS ANGELES - MORNING 
Kate is in her kitchen cooking breakfast for the kids. Gordon watches the Governor on the news. 
GOVERNOR (with Austrian ACCENT) ... just this morning my people at Caltech told me that in the last 36 hours we had basically zero earthquake activity in Southern California, which is very rare... (CONTINUED) 
The phone rings. Kate picks up. 
EXT. STREETS/LOS ANGELES - MORNING 
Jackson drives like crazy. 
JACKSON ... Kate, we have to get out of LA! I've rented a plane for us. Get the kids ready! I'll be there in five. 
KATE The kids have plans today... 
JACKSON Are you kidding me! 
KATE No I'm not! Noah has music at 2 and Lil' has Karate. 
Gordon rolls his eyes and mutters. 
GORDON Not that we'd expect him to remember. 
JACKSON (SCREAMING) California is going down! Pack up the kids! 
KATE You're crazy! The Governor just said we're fine now. 
JACKSON The Governor's a meathead, how would he know anything? Kate listen! You gotta trust me over some politician. Come on. 
INT. KATE'S HOUSE/LOS ANGELES - MORNING 
Kate slams the phone down. Lilly stops eating. 
LILLY Mommy, why are you so angry with Daddy? 
LAURA Because your daddy is a lunatic, darling. 
On the TV, the interview comes to an end. 
(CONTINUED) 
GOVERNOR ... it looks to me, like the worst is over. 
That moment a MASSIVE QUAKE hits Los Angeles. 
Everybody dives under the table. 
ON TV: The news casters and the Governor do the same. A few seconds later the signal cuts out. 
Gordon pulls Kate and the kids close as the earth shakes violently for 20 seconds. 
EXT. KATE'S HOUSE/LOS ANGELES - MORNING 
Jackson flies into the driveway and runs into the house. 
INT. KATE'S HOUSE/LOS ANGELES - MORNING 
When he enters, Lilly immediately runs into his arms. The next tremor hits. Cracks form on the kitchen floor. 
JACKSON We have to leave! Noah, let's go! 
KATE I think we're safer here! 
JACKSON Noah, now! Kate please... 
The whole house rides up and down like on a wave. 
GORDON I think he's right. 
Finally Kate pushes her son out from under the table. They all scramble out of the house in a panic. Kate is cut on the shoulder by falling glass but she hardly notices. 
EXT. KATE'S HOUSE/LOS ANGELES - MORNING 
As they storm out of their front door the house crumbles behind them. 
JACKSON Get in the car! 
The whole street starts to buckle. Left and right the houses are shaken and smashed like toys. 
The waiter nods. A few more bars of music, then applause. 
HARRY (CONT'D) (into the microphone) Thank you ladies and gentlemen. Let's hear it for the one and only Tony Delgado... And I'm Harry Helmsley and we'll be back after a short pit stop. 
Applause. Harry rushes off stage. 
ADRIAN (O.S.) Dad... what I have to tell you is very serious... 
INT. HALLWAY/WHITE HOUSE - DAY 
Adrian is standing in a dark corner. Behind him people are packing up, carrying boxes. 
ADRIAN You remember when I told you about the dam in China? Well, it's happening much sooner than we anticipated. 
INT. GALLEY/CRUISE SHIP - DAY 
Harry's face has turned serious. 
ADRIAN (O.S.) The President has ordered us to clear out the White House. 
HARRY Hah... About time someone cleaned up that mess. 
INT. HALLWAY/WHITE HOUSE - DAY 
Adrian fights back the tears. 
(CONTINUED) 
ADRIAN Where are you, dad? What exactly is the course of the `Freedom' right now?... 
HARRY (O.S.) It's all good, Adrian. Don't worry about your old man. You have more important things to do now. 
INT. GALLEY/CRUISE SHIP - DAY 
There's a tremor in Harry's voice. 
HARRY You know, your mom and I, we had a hell of a great life... and a hell of a great kid too. (PAUSE) And the `Freedom' is a pretty big ship you know... Don't write your old man off, just yet. 
INT. HALLWAY/WHITE HOUSE - DAY 
A tear runs down Adrian's face. 
HARRY (O.S.) ... Besides, I could never leave Tony alone. You know how he can't keep decent time by himself. 
Pause. 
ADRIAN I love you, dad. 
INT. GALLEY/CRUISE SHIP - DAY 
Harry bites his lip. 
HARRY Love you too, son. 
INT. BAR/CRUISE SHIP - DAY 
Back in the lounge, Tony has finished his cocktail. Harry walks up and hollers at the barkeeper. 
HARRY Hey Herb. Get me a double Jack on the rocks. 
(CONTINUED) 
TONY After twenty-five years on the wagon? 
HARRY Why not? Who cares how long we do certain things? How long we drink booze, how long we talk to people... Or how long we don't talk to people. 
Harry grabs Tony by his shirt. 
TONY Woah!... Harry, what's the matter with you? Let's go. We're back on. 
Harry pulls him even closer. 
HARRY Call your kid, you stubborn old ass. (PAUSE) I'm not going back on that stage unless you promise to call him. 
WAITER (INTERRUPTING) Tony, the ladies are waiting for you. 
HARRY Promise me, Tony... please. 
Harry stares him down. 
TONY Yeah, maybe I should call him... 
Harry smiles, downs his bourbon and walks back on stage. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ADRIAN'S OFFICE/WHITE HOUSE - DAY 
Adrian enters his office. The TV is on. 
NEWS ANCHOR ... There is little we know at this point, but the earthquake registered at 10.1 on the Richter scale. The whole of the Western seaboard was hit... 
Assistants stare at the news in shocked disbelief, some of them are crying. Prof. West appears at the door. 
ADRIAN (pointing at the TV) Have you seen this? (CONTINUED) 
Prof. West silently nods and beckons Adrian, who follows him down the hall into a dark control room. They look at a wall- sized high def monitor. 
PROF. WEST We have satellite images. Here's the sequence we've got so far. 
On the monitors, detailed satellite imagery displays how the monstrous quake unfolds, leaving California sliding into the sea. 
ADRIAN Any news from Yellowstone? 
PROF. WEST Anytime now. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. RESEARCH FACILITY/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY 
The base is abandoned but for a few structures and the enormous drilling tower. 
Gordon manages to land the plane next to what looks like a fueling station. Jackson leaps out checking the pump. 
Charlie has his broadcasting equipment strapped to his body. The antenna's flag is whipping in the wind. 
CHARLIE FROST (into his mic) ... I wish you guys at home could see this on TV... 
He notices Jackson and muffles the microphone. 
CHARLIE FROST (CONT'D) How did you make it up here? Thought you were toast. 
JACKSON The spaceships Charlie, where are they? 
CHARLIE FROST You can't make it there. 
(CONTINUED) 
JACKSON We have a plane. We can get you out of here too. Let's go Charlie! 
All around the landscape begins to collapse. A three mile crater forms, revealing the awe-inspiring sight of the super- volcano. 
CHARLIE FROST You'll never make it out in time. Just stay and enjoy the big bang. That your kid? 
Jackson discovers Lilly standing behind him, staring at Charlie with her big brown eyes. 
Jackson grabs Charlie lifting him off the ground. 
JACKSON Where is that god damn map! 
CHARLIE FROST Easy, easy. Watch the mic... I don't know. Somewhere in my camper. 
A low rumble builds to a rapturous thunder as MILLIONS OF BIRDS tear into flight. 
CHARLIE FROST (CONT'D) Wow! Look at that!... (into his mic) Fly birdies fly! This marks the last day of the United States of America folks and by tomorrow... 
The mouth of the volcano starts to break apart revealing molten lava underneath. 
CHARLIE FROST (CONT'D) ... the last of mankind. Soon they'll see us from a million miles away, out there in the milky way... 
Jackson grabs his wide eyed daughter and races down the mountain. 
EXT. BELOW MOUNTAIN PEAK/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY 
Jackson and Lilly jump into the RV and races off, with Charlie's broadcast still playing. 
CHARLIE'S VOICE ... The ash cloud will travel everywhere. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
CHARLIE'S VOICE (CONT'D) First the lights will go out in Vegas, then Dallas, St. Louis and then Washington DC... 
Jackson's cell phone rings and he picks up. 
JACKSON We're on our way. 
EXT. RESEARCH FACILITY/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY 
KATE Jackson, things are really looking bad here! 
In that instant, the air around them vanishes, as if sucked from the landscape into a vacuum. 
THE BIGGEST EXPLOSION THE WORLD HAS EVER SEEN... At least in the last 640,000 years. 
To them, all this occurs in total silence. The sound of the eruption has not reached them yet. 
They are frozen, unable to comprehend what is happening. 
EXT. MOUNTAIN PEAK/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY 
The explosion begins to resembles an atomic mushroom. 
CHARLIE FROST ... it's beautiful, kids! Just beautiful! 
The sound waves reach Charlie, throwing him to the ground. 
EXT. DIRT ROAD/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY 
The RV flies over the rugged terrain. Everywhere the earth is cracking, falling apart. Jackson struggles to swerve around the disappearing landscape. 
LILLY (SCREAMING) It's following us! 
Lilly has discovered the expanding ASH CLOUD behind them. 
JACKSON Just don't look back, Lil'bee! 
The THUNDERING sound envelopes them! On the radio, the voice of Charlie is getting shrill. (CONTINUED) 
CHARLIE'S VOICE Majestic!... Oh yeah! 
EXT. MOUNTAIN PEAK/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY 
Charlie slowly tries to stand again, silhouetted against the cloud of dust and fire towering above him. 
Flaming rocks fly towards him. When they hit the ground, they detonate like fire bombs. 
CHARLIE'S VOICE Oh baby! It's coming! 
EXT. DIRT ROAD/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY 
Rocks plummet like comets around the RV as Jackson races over a collapsing bridge. On the radio, in his delirious state, Charlie begins to sing... 
CHARLIE'S VOICE `This is the end, my friend'... 
Yellowstone looks like a war zone. The RV dodges the bombardment of fire and rock. 
EXT. MOUNTAIN PEAK/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY 
Huge tree trunks and glowing boulders fly at Charlie through the ashes. He screams at the top of his lungs. 
CHARLIE FROST ... Folks, always remember, you heard it first from Charlie. 
A second later, Charlie's radio antenna comes spinning like a scythe through the air. It decapitates Charlie in an instant. 
EXT. DIRT ROAD/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY 
The radio cuts out. The forest and the camp grounds are mown flat by the extreme force of the ASH CLOUD. In the rear view mirror Jackson sees it gaining on them. 
JACKSON LILLY! DOWN! 
CUT TO: 
INT. WEST WING/WHITE HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON 
The White House is being evacuated. Amidst the chaos stands Anheuser. Adrian puts down a phone and looks at him. 
ADRIAN Just a few minutes ago Yellowstone erupted, sir. The ash cloud will reach Washington in roughly 7 hours. Maybe 6. We have strong easterly winds... 
ANHEUSER And the crustal displacement? 
(CONTINUED) 
ADRIAN No one knows, sir. 
Anheuser starts walking, Adrian trails behind. 
ANHEUSER Let's get the government airborne and... I mean now. 
INT. OVAL OFFICE/WHITE HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON 
Anheuser and Adrian burst into the Anteroom of the Oval Office. The President's secretary, SALLY, 55, is packing. 
ANHEUSER Where is the President, Sally? 
Sally looks up stone faced. 
SALLY He said he wanted to spend a few minutes alone. I think he's over at the chapel. 
ANHEUSER The whole North American continent is about to perish, and Wilson decides to go to church! 
Adrian shoots an angry look at Anheuser. 
ADRIAN He's praying sir. Which considering the circumstances is not a bad idea. 
ANHEUSER Maybe. But right now I need the leader of the free world off his knees and on Air Force One. Wheels up 1900 hours. Can I leave that with you Helmsley? 
Anheuser walks away. Adrian and Sally exchange a look. 
SALLY I really don't like that man. 
INT. CHAPEL/WHITE HOUSE - SUNSET 
Adrian finds the President standing near the front of the chapel. 
ADRIAN Mr. President? We need to get you out of Washington immediately. (CONTINUED) 
President Wilson stays with his head bowed. 
PRESIDENT WILSON Now matter how idealistic you are taking office. You lose your innocence behind that desk. (PAUSE) Laura was right. People have died because of the decisions I made. 
ADRIAN That's not your fault sir. 
He turns to face Adrian. 
PRESIDENT WILSON You sound like Anheuser. 
This quietly affects Adrian. 
PRESIDENT WILSON (CONT'D) Laura's never looked at me like that before. Only once... When I told her, her mother had died. You knew the first lady? 
ADRIAN A little. 
PRESIDENT WILSON You know what she said to me that night we brought her to the hospital? (PAUSE) `Tommy... I think you should do a lottery. Every one should have a chance to go'. That's what Dorothy said to me. That's what we should have done. 
ADRIAN There would have been chaos, sir. 
President Wilson looks Adrian in the eyes. 
PRESIDENT WILSON You know what I believe, Adrian. I believe nature should choose for itself, from itself. 
Adrian takes this in. 
PRESIDENT WILSON (CONT'D) Don't let her go. You'll regret it if you do. Prove to Laura what kind of a man you are. And I'll do the same... You go now. And watch your back for Anheuser. (CONTINUED) 
Adrian stares at the President in disbelief. 
ADRIAN But sir? 
PRESIDENT WILSON Go. That's an order Helmsley. 
A tense moment before Adrian starts to walk away. Just as he exits the chapel, Wilson calls after him. 
PRESIDENT WILSON (CONT'D) Would you tell my daughter... there's nothing on earth that I cherish more than her. 
We hold on President Wilson's face. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. LAS VEGAS - SUNSET 
Most of Las Vegas is destroyed. A 200 foot wide canyon now divides sin city along its famous strip. The towering casinos still teeter along the canyon's rim. 
All forms of emergency rescue operations are deployed around the city. 
In the FOREGROUND, we see Las Vegas International Airport, its runway cut dramatically short. Large pieces of tarmac continue to break off into the crevasse. 
EXT. AIRFIELD/LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - SUNSET 
Gordon maneuvers his plane through the chaos. Airplanes are strewn about the runway. Passengers everywhere. 
GORDON I told you we should have gone to my parents' in the Rockies. 
KATE Gordon's right. Look at this mess. 
Jackson looks around frantically. 
JACKSON You don't understand, it's our only chance. 
(CONTINUED) 
GORDON This isn't one of your crazy stories now. How the hell are we gonna make it to China? 
NOAH Gordon, without Jackson, we'd never have made it out of California. 
Kate gives Gordon a look. 
GORDON (EMBARRASSED) She's a patient, honey. 
JACKSON (SARCASTICALLY) Nice work. 
But when Jackson discovers Yuri behind her, his tone suddenly changes. He gets in Yuri's face. 
JACKSON (CONT'D) You bastard. You knew it all along! (at the twins) You and those spoiled rotten sons of yours... 
Sasha comes running in and cuts through this. 
SASHA I found us a plane, an Antonov. They were just about to take off, but the tower didn't let them. 
YURI Can you still fly that thing? 
SASHA Sure... But I need a copilot. 
Lilly chimes in. 
LILLY Gordon is a pilot. 
(CONTINUED) 
Before Gordon can protest Jackson picks up Lilly. 
JACKSON Let's go! 
They burst through the emergency exit, setting off an alarm. Emergency personnel yell after them. 
RESCUE WORKER Hey! Stop! You can't go out there! Come back! 
But they keep on running. Sasha now leads the way. 
EXT. AIR FIELD/LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - DUSK 
They race around the corner and come to a halt. Before them, a Russian freight plane of enormous size-- 
The ANTONOV 225, the biggest aircraft in the world. 
NOAH Wow, that is a big plane. 
YURI (PROUDLY) It's Russian. 
Sasha, who has run ahead turns back and sees: 
A MASSIVE GREY WALL OF ASH moving towards the airport. 
SASHA Guys, follow me! 
They all run after him up the stairs. 
INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - DUSK 
Sasha enters the cockpit and puts on the headset while readying the plane for takeoff. 
SASHA (into the mic) You'll find folding seats on each side of the cargo hold... 
INT. CARGO HOLD/ANTONOV - DUSK 
SASHA (O.S.) ... Sit down and buckle up! 
They all scramble to get into their seats. (CONTINUED) 
NOAH Wow! Look at those! 
They discover the cargo they are carrying-- 
Sports cars, SUV's, concept cars and luxury models, some of them are labeled `Las Vegas Auto Show 2012'. 
YURI We had VIP tickets for that. 
The six engines of the Antonov come roaring to life. 
INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - DUSK 
The plane is starting to move. Gordon sits uncomfortably in the copilot's seat. 
SASHA You check the main bus for the hydraulics. I'll balance the tanks. 
GORDON Uh... What? 
Sasha reaches over and does it himself. 
SASHA Work the radio and keep an eye on the fuel, okay? 
Gordon nods and puts on the headset, trying to focus. 
INT. TERMINAL/LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - DUSK 
People start SCREAMING, when they discover the menacing WALL OF ASH racing towards them. 
RESCUE WORKER Move back, people... down on the floor! 
EXT. RUNWAY/LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - DUSK 
The nose of the Antonov turns onto the runway. This humongous plane suddenly looks small against the wall of ash. 
INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - DUSK 
Gordon is panicking. 
GORDON We have to get going! (CONTINUED) 
Sasha hits the throttle. 
SASHA (CALM) We're going, we're going. 
A deafening THUNDER emanates from the engines. 
INT. CARGO HOLD/ANTONOV - DUSK 
Everybody grabs their seat as the vibration of the aircraft builds. 
The young monk jumps out, quickly bowing. 
NENG Mother, I got a message from Lin. He wants us to meet him in Cho Ming, at the west gate. He says he can get us on one of the ships he is working on. 
Mrs. Pang is still holding the chicken by its throat. 
MRS. PANG I thought Lin is working on the dam? 
NENG The dam is a ship, Mother. The government lied to us. There will be a big flood. 
The chicken hangs limp in Mrs. Pang's hand. 
MRS. PANG Not here in the mountains... Let's eat first. 
The hen panics as she puts its head back on the block, raising the hatchet again. (CONTINUED) 
NENG No mother! We must pack up right away. 
NENG'S MOTHER We took a trip with the Laem Song ferry once. Your father was throwing up the whole way. 
The door opens and Mr. Pang appears. 
MR. PANG Neng, I did not know you were coming for dinner. 
At that moment the hatchet drops with a THUD! 
CUT TO: 
EXT. ANTONOV/OVER THE PACIFIC - NIGHT 
The majestic Antonov is flying high in the Pacific skies. 
OLEG (O.S.) Look, the new Bentley. 
INT. CARGO HOLD/ANTONOV - NIGHT 
The boys are exploring the huge freight deck. Caesar, the little dog, is traipsing along. 
Alec, Oleg and Noah marvel at a stylish mixture of luxury and performance cars. 
ALEC Our dad had one on order. We were supposed to get it next year. 
OLEG But then he cancelled it again, because of the ships. 
Noah points to a 2012 Aston Martin parked further back. 
NOAH If I was rich, I'd get one of those. 
OLEG We have one. How many cars does your family have? 
NOAH My Mom's boyfriend has a Porsche, a Carrera 4. 
(CONTINUED) 
ALEC Our parents are divorced too. 
The boys share a moment of understanding. 
NOAH Nothing we can do about that. 
Noah reaches for the door of the Bentley. To his surprise, it opens. 
NOAH (CONT'D) Wow... look at this. 
Noah jumps into the car. 
KATE (O.S.) Be careful, Noh'! 
Kate and Lilly are still belted in next to Tamara. Jackson and Yuri sit on the other side of the Antonov. 
TAMARA How did you meet Dr. Silberman? He's great, isn't he? 
KATE I think for the same reasons you did. You know, after breast feeding two kids... 
Kate looks at Tamara. 
KATE (CONT'D) Did your husband ask you to get your's done? 
TAMARA We are not married. And we probably never will... But he paid for them. 
KATE I bet he did. 
They laugh. 
LILLY What did the man pay for mommy? 
KATE Nothing, Lil'bee. 
Kate looks over at Jackson who's trying to make sense of Charlie's map. Tamara catches her looking. 
(CONTINUED) 
TAMARA What's your situation? 
Kate lets out a sigh. 
KATE Way too complicated... 
On the other side of the plane, Yuri has been watching the two women talk. 
YURI They seem to like each other. 
JACKSON I guess... So tell me Mr. Karpov - how much did you pay? 
YURI One billion euro, per seat. 
JACKSON That's disgusting. 
YURI You know Curtis, I wasn't always businessman. I am a boxer. Was my only playing when I was a boy, back in Murmansk. My coach... (SMILING) ... his name also Yuri... He always said: `Someone wants to beat you... he has to kill you first'. 
Yuri puts his hand on Jackson's shoulder. 
YURI (CONT'D) What would you have done, if you rich like me? Just look at your gorgeous kids. And call me Yuri... 
ADRIAN (CONT'D) What would you say were the chances of a first time, middle-aged writer, who barely sold 500 copies of his novel making it on board this plane? 
LAURA Zero. What's your point? 
Adrian pulls out the book from his bag. He shows her. 
ADRIAN It's called `Farewell Atlantis' and it's a fantastic read. It's part of our legacy now. 
Laura takes this in. The plane's intercom cuts through the moment. 
INTERCOM (O.S.) Mr. Helmsley, Prof. West requests your presence immediately. 
Adrian takes a breath, but before he leaves - 
ADRIAN What if I tried to sort some of this mess out? I need to know you can forgive me... 
Laura looks at him sadly, but with a little hope. 
LAURA I need to know that too, Adrian. 
Adrian moves for the door. He stops. 
ADRIAN One more thing. Your father told me you were the most precious thing to him in the whole world... You are to me too. 
As Adrian exits, we hold on Laura's conflicted face. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. WHITE HOUSE/WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT 
The cloud from the Yellowstone eruption has hit Washington D.C. hard. Pennsylvania Avenue resembles a war zone. A ten inch layer of ash lies on the ground. 
The gates of the White House are wide open, with ash-covered rescue workers running about, resembling ghosts. 
INT. WEST WING/WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT 
The President has turned the whole West Wing into a shelter. He walks through the packed rooms assisting where he can. 
An old African-American LADY holds a crying young girl. President Wilson kneels down to her. 
OLD LADY She can't find her mother. 
PRESIDENT Why don't you two girls make yourself comfy on that big couch? I'll see what I can do. 
The child nods. The President gets up. 
PRESIDENT WILSON Sally, can you take care of them. I'll go check with the Red Cross... 
As he leaves, the old lady looks up at Sally and smiles. 
OLD LADY No wonder the First Lady fell for him. I knew Miss Dorothy Jones long before the President, when she was still singing jazz down in Atlanta with Harry Helmsley. 
SALLY I know, she was amazing. 
EXT. FRONT LAWN/WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT 
The President walks up to the Red Cross tents placed on the front lawn. He stops one of the Red Cross volunteers. 
PRESIDENT WILSON Who can help me with missing persons? 
Without looking up, the young guy responds. 
RED CROSS VOLUNTEER Sorry man, I'm busy right now. 
He then recognizes who he's talking to. 
RED CROSS VOLUNTEER (CONT'D) I mean, of course sir. I didn't realize... What can I do for you, Mr. President? 
The President pats him on the shoulder. (CONTINUED) 
PRESIDENT WILSON Don't worry about it. You're doing a great job son... 
A deep, low rumble begins, stopping everybody in place. 
As it builds, the President grabs onto a tent pole to secure himself. He looks out over Washington D.C. His eyes grow wide... 
The National Mall bends like rubber. The towering Washington Monument breaks into pieces. 
An even more deafening sound makes him turn-- 
The Capitol Building rises from behind the trees, lifted up by earth's incredible force. 
As the whole building breaks apart, the President is thrown to the ground. 
CUT TO: 
INT. COMMAND CENTER/AIR FORCE ONE - DAY 
All the officers and scientists are glued to monitors that show satellite images from all over the globe. Adrian and Prof. West stare in disbelief. 
SCIENCE OFFICER The capitol was hit by a 9.4. 
Laura enters the command center unnoticed. 
COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER We lost communication with the White House, sir. 
She stands there frozen, emotionless. She looks over to Anheuser, who is shouting orders. Another officer hands him a phone. 
LIEUTENANT #2 President Makarenko for you sir. He's just entered Chinese air space. 
Anheuser takes the phone and after a beat answers. 
ANHEUSER That's affirmative, Mr. President. Until communication is restored, I am in command. 
Adrian and Laura look to each other baffled. 
(CONTINUED) 
ANHEUSER (CONT'D) ... It seems all other Heads of State are en route, however there are unconfirmed reports that the Italian Prime Minister has also decided to stay behind and trust in prayer rather than action... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. ST. PETER'S SQUARE/ROME - DAWN 
SCIENCE OFFICER #2 We've recorded two quakes averaging 
She grabs Adrian's hand. Anheuser sees this and his suspicions about them are confirmed. A cold little smile appears on his face. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SALON/CRUISE SHIP - NIGHT 
Tony is watching TV with a group of passengers. Harry has just entered and stands near the back of the room. 
A TEENAGE BOY with bad acne searches for an available channel that is still broadcasting. He finds a news program with lousy reception. 
NEWSCASTER ... Tokyo seems to have taken the severity of the hit... Unconfirmed reports indicate that the entire island of Japan is below water... 
The signal gets weaker. 
Harry watches Tony slowly stand up. As he turns to his friend, his knees begin to buckle. His face is pale. 
TONY I called... But I never got through. 
(CONTINUED) 
HARRY I'm so sorry. 
Tony only stares back at him. 
Behind them, the TV rolls to the side, as the whole room begins to tilt. 
Harry grabs on to the door frame, as the passengers along with Tony fall like dominoes. 
HARRY (CONT'D) Tony!! 
As the ship rolls to the side, Harry finds himself hanging from the door frame now 20 feet off the ground. He's barely able to pull himself up and roll onto the middle deck. 
EXT. MIDDLE DECK/CRUISE SHIP - NIGHT 
On his back, Harry is shocked to see the star field and the moon shifting across the sky. 
An eerie sound fills the air. A gigantic swell has formed off to his right. It's a mountain of water. 
Harry turns to see another gargantuan swell close in from the other side of the `Freedom of the Seas'. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SHIBAM/YEMEN - DAY 
The old walled city of Shibam is in ruins. The 2,000-year-old towers lie on the desert ground. Hundreds of believers have gathered to pray towards Mecca. 
As they raise their hands to heaven in unison, they slow their motion and the chanting dissipates. 
They stare into the distance not knowing if what they see is reality or only a mirage. 
A monstrous tidal wave rises from the desert sands thundering towards them. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. WHITE HOUSE/WASHINGTON DC - NIGHT 
President Wilson's body lays between the rubble. As he slowly regains consciousness, all he can hear is the flapping sound of the collapsed Red Cross tents. (CONTINUED) 
As President Wilson gets to his feet, he sees-- 
A tidal wave come sweeping over the remains of the Washington Mall and it carries with it the battleships of the 14th Fleet of the US Navy that were anchored in Chesapeake Bay. 
The President looks ahead, calm and peaceful. 
PRESIDENT WILSON I'm coming home Dorothy... 
The CAMERA follows the aircraft carrier `USS John F. Kennedy' as it slams broadside into the White House. 
CUT TO: 
INT. COMMAND CENTER/AIR FORCE ONE - DAY 
Hushed voices. Anheuser, Adrian and Prof. West stand amongst a group of officers and analysts. 
COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER #1 All global ground communication has ceased sir. 
COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER #2 The only signal our satellites are picking up are coming from the vessels in Cho Ming. 
ANHEUSER At least some good news. 
Anheuser turns to Adrian. 
ANHEUSER (CONT'D) Would our science advisor care to give us his assessment? 
ADRIAN We expect enormous tsunamis to reach landfall in every continent. The Cho Ming area will be impacted in approximately six hours. 
He nods to one of the analysts, who types in a couple of commands. 
ADRIAN (CONT'D) ... and it looks like the crust has shifted by nearly 23 degrees in a south- westerly direction. Here's the computer simulation. 
(CONTINUED) 
Everybody stares as the graphic illustrates what happened to planet Earth. 
ADRIAN (CONT'D) Our data also shows, that our earth's poles have reversed their magnetic fields... (POINTING) ... These are their new positions. 
Anheuser looks at the monitor, then turns to Adrian. 
ANHEUSER So Helmsley, what you're telling us here is that... the north pole is now somewhere in Wisconsin? 
Silence. Adrian clears his throat. 
ADRIAN It's the south pole, sir. 
An ALARM SIGNAL goes off-- 
CUT TO: 
INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - DAWN 
A red light blinks on the plane's instrument panel. 
TAMARA Yuri bear, what are we doing? 
YURI We're taking the Bentley! 
INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - DAWN 
Sasha is struggling with the gyrating wheel. The glittering snow field comes flying towards them. 
(CONTINUED) 
SASHA CHTO ZA... Gordon! We're still too fast! 
Sasha pulls the Antonov back up. 
SASHA (CONT'D) Now! Open it! 
Gordon yanks with all his might. A loud NOISE. 
INT. CARGO HOLD/ANTONOV - DAWN 
The cargo door drops open. The Antonov is extremely close to the glacier's surface. 
Jackson tries to start the Bentley, but nothing happens. Everyone screams in panic. 
YURI SHUT UP EVERY ONE! 
They all go quiet, except for a few muffled barks from Caesar. Yuri speaks towards the dashboard, slowly and clearly. 
YURI (CONT'D) Engine... start... 
The motor revs to life. Yuri looks at Jackson. 
YURI (CONT'D) Voice control... Sold me on it. 
INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - DAWN 
Sasha barely holds on. He yells at Gordon. 
SASHA Your turn Gordon! Go! Make sure that they make it out of here before I touch down! 
GORDON What about you?! 
SASHA I'll be fine! I have to land this thing! 
Gordon hesitates. 
SASHA (CONT'D) What are you waiting for! (CONTINUED) 
Sasha nods at him reassuringly. Gordon bolts out. 
INT. CARGO HOLD/ANTONOV - DAWN 
The cargo door scrapes against the glacier, hurling ice everywhere. The Bentley roars. 
YURI (O.S.) Push it Curtis! 
JACKSON We're waiting for Sasha and Gordon. 
Noah turns and sees Gordon. 
NOAH Tamara! Open the door! 
Gordon jumps in. Tamara yells at him in desperation. 
TAMARA Where's Sasha? 
GORDON He said he'll be fine and we should get out of here before he touches down. 
Yuri notices Tamara's distress as she keeps looking back to the cockpit. Jackson slams the pedal down trying to gain as much speed as possible to soften their landing. 
LILLY Daaadddy! 
The Bentley shoots out the back of the plane. As it hits the snow, the air bags deploy cushioning the passengers. 
The Antonov hits the ice and catapults the rest of the luxury cars out of the back cargo hold. They barrel past the Bentley like skittles, narrowly missing it as they fly off in opposite directions. 
The plane skids across the glacier, clipping its wing and causing the aircraft to break apart. 
Sasha has no control anymore and watches helplessly as he shoots towards the ledge in the Antonov, plunging into the deep. 
The plane crashes and explodes. 
EXT. GLACIER/TIBET - DAWN 
As the snow settles we see that the glacier is scattered with luxury cars tomb-stoned in the snow. 
The Bentley is half buried. We hear Caesar barking. 
JACKSON (O.S.) Everybody okay back there? 
KATE (O.S.) We're all fine. 
The door opens and Jackson climbs out, looking around. Just above the wind, he hears the SOUND OF HELICOPTER BLADES. 
One by one the others appear behind Jackson and stare at a surreal sight-- 
Several Chinese Mil-26 choppers airlift animals over the mountain pass. 
GIRAFFES, ZEBRAS, EVEN ELEPHANTS hang by huge straps from these flying machines. 
One of the smaller helicopters veers from the transport fleet and lands near the Bentley. 
Armed soldiers jump out. Their Commander speaks to them in a sharp tone. 
CHINESE COMMANDER Welcome to the People's Republic of China. 
Jackson nods to them. 
JACKSON Thank you... (to Lilly and Noah) Say thank you, kids. 
The others acknowledge the soldiers as well. Hi... Hello... 
CHINESE COMMANDER What color are your passes? 
Kate holds Noah by the hand. Gordon and Tamara trail behind. She's still very upset. 
TAMARA I should have listened to you, Dr. Silberman. I actually liked the way I looked before that monster talked me into it. 
GORDON Did you know he asked for a discount... and he paid in installments? 
TAMARA Cheap bastard. 
GORDON You're better off without him. What he said about you and Sasha, is it true? 
Tamara nods silently. 
TAMARA Now that he's gone I think he was worth a hundred times a man like Yuri. 
Suddenly they hear the PUTTERING of an engine. 
JACKSON You guys hear that? 
In the distance, an old rusty truck comes bumping down the dirt road. Jackson puts down Lilly and chases after it. 
EXT. DIRT ROAD/NEAR CHO MING - DAWN 
Neng and his parents drive past, billowing a huge cloud of dust just as Jackson reaches the road. 
JACKSON (out of breath) Hey! Help! Wait for us! 
But Neng doesn't hear him over the rattling truck. Jackson, pissed, kicks at the rocks on the road. 
JACKSON (CONT'D) Shit! Shit! 
Just then, Neng's mother, sitting in the back of the truck, turns and sees his tantrum. She bangs on the rear window of the cabin. 
Neng looks in the mirror and hits the brakes. Jackson can't believe his luck. (CONTINUED) 
The others show up and they all run towards the truck. 
CUT TO: 
INT. INSIDE MOUNTAIN/CHO MING - DAWN 
Anheuser and Laura follow Captain Michaels and a Chinese Steward over one of the many boarding bridges erected inside the cavernous mountain that lead to one of the monstrous arks. Laura stops halfway, gazing in awe-- 
Deep down below, thousands of workers are swarming over the ship, readying it for launch. 
Laura looks up and sees the contrast, spotting the SHEIK we met in the Dorchester Hotel as he boards comfortably with his huge family. 
Laura points down at the workers. 
LAURA Captain Michaels? What happens to all those people? 
The Captain doesn't know what to say. Anheuser turns. 
ANHEUSER Dr. Wilson, there's a protocol for all that. You just stick to your art. We'll handle the rest. 
Laura hates him in that moment. 
ANHEUSER (CONT'D) Captain? Where is the Bridge? 
Anheuser and Captain Michaels move away as Laura stands and watches the frantic workers who are now boarding the animals we saw being airlifted over the mountains. 
CHINESE STEWARD (O.S.) Dr. Wilson? Your cabin is this way. 
Laura has a look of guilt as she follows the steward. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. NAMPAN MOUNTAINS/EAST COAST OF INDIA - SUNRISE 
Thousands are on the march up the mountains. Behind them a valley stretches into the horizon. Plumes of smoke rise from destroyed cities in the distance. 
(CONTINUED) 
Amongst the refugees, we discover Satnam, the young astrophysicist, holding his little son. The rest of Satnam's family trails behind. 
Distant WARNING SIRENS pierce the silent march, coming from the cities below. 
People start to scream and run, but Satnam stands there frozen. He fumbles for his satellite phone, then hits a number on its speed dial. 
INT. LIVING QUARTERS/AMERICAN SHIP - SUNRISE 
Adrian is unpacking. He lays down his copy of `Farewell Atlantis' just as his cell phone rings. 
ADRIAN Satnam? (CONFUSED) Where are you? 
SATNAM (O.S.) On the Nampan Plateau... 
Adrian's face goes pale. 
ADRIAN What?! 
SATNAM There's a tidal wave coming from the East! It's huge! 
ADRIAN Satnam, what happened? 
SATNAM (O.S.) We never got picked up, Adrian, the airlift never came! 
Adrian closes his eyes. 
EXT. NAMPAN MOUNTAINS/EAST COAST OF INDIA - SUNRISE 
Satnam swallows hard. He stares out into the valley. 
SATNAM I have to go! 
A wall of undulating foam and debris comes rolling towards him. A tidal wave of gigantic height. 
Everybody panics and scratches for a higher elevation. But for Satnam it is clear, they do not stand a chance. (CONTINUED) 
He picks up his little son, squeezing him tightly to his chest, humming an Indian lullaby for the scared child. 
INT. LIVING QUARTERS/AMERICAN SHIP - SUNRISE 
Adrian hears SCREAMING on the phone and the deafening sound of the approaching wave. He tenses up, desperate but unable to do anything. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SHIP BAY/CHO MING - EARLY MORNING 
We finally reveal the unbelievable magnitude of this ship yard, built into the hollow belly of the mountains. 
Nine gargantuan vessels are lined up next to each other. Their size is at least four times that of the `Freedom of the Seas'. However, they look more like spaceships than anything, having been built aerodynamically to withstand the full force of nature. 
But only three of these monstrous ARKS are complete. Number 4 is being repaired, all the others are still under construction, surrounded by scaffolding. 
Suddenly SIRENS goes off! 
The boarding bridges to the finished vessels begin to retract. There's growing confusion among the thousands of workers and security personnel. 
INT. PLATFORM, SHIP BAY/CHO MING - EARLY MORNING 
Opposite the boarding bridges, on a large platform, Yuri and his boys sit in line with the other waiting passengers. 
They watch as massive stern gates begin to close. Yuri jumps up and yells to the others. 
YURI They're leaving without us! 
The soldier from earlier points his gun at him. 
SOLDIER What did I tell you! 
Caesar barks at the guy. 
(CONTINUED) 
YURI (POINTING) Look! Idiot! They are leaving you behind too! 
The soldier turns to the ships and Yuri knocks him out. He grabs his boys and runs towards the closing gates. All the other passengers surge forward with him. 
In the distance, on the bow side of the ships, the huge mountain gates of the bay open, revealing a stunning view of Cho Ming Valley. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. MOUNTAIN RIDGE/CHO MING - MORNING 
Lin leads his group over a ridge. In front of their eyes-- 
The gates to the mountain open! 
LIN (in Chinese) We have to hurry! (to Jackson) They launch! We run out of time! 
They follow Lin rushing down the hill, towards one of the many Y-shaped launch structures towering in front of the gates. Neng and Kate help Mr. and Mrs. Pang down the rocky terrain. 
INT. SHIP BAY/CHO MING - MORNING 
A screeching and thundering noise! 
THE THREE COMPLETED VESSELS BEGIN TO INCH FORWARD on metal girders connecting the Y-shaped launch towers. 
INT. LIVING QUARTERS/AMERICAN SHIP - MORNING 
Laura feels a jolt. She rushes out of her small cabin and into a swarm of people moving down a crammed endless corridor. She struggles to fight her way through. 
A digital voice blares over the speakers. 
COMPUTER VOICE Countdown to departure. Launch in 17 minutes - 42 seconds. 
Laura bumps into one of Adrian's Science Officers. 
(CONTINUED) 
LAURA Where can I find Adrian Helmsley? 
SCIENCE OFFICER He's in the Technical Command Centre. Follow me. 
EXT. LAUNCH SITE/CHO MING VALLEY - MORNING 
The three gigantic vessels emerge from the mountain, into the open. Support helicopters swarm around them like flies. 
EXT. BENEATH A LAUNCHING TOWER/CHO-MING - MORNING 
Lin and his group look like ants as they scale the metal ladders of one of the launch towers. 
INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - MORNING 
Verbal commands fly back and forth. Anheuser watches the preparations from a large window. 
He looks over to the command bridges of the other vessels as they continue to be pulled into place. 
INT. COMMAND BRIDGES/OTHER SHIPS - MORNING 
We cut to the various Heads of State, all at their command posts. 
EXT. TOP OF LAUNCHING TOWER/CHO MING - MORNING 
A hatch opens at the top of the launch tower. Lin is the first to climb out. 
Right before his eyes, the hull of the American Ship slowly creeps towards him. He's but a speck against this man-made behemoth. 
Lin hastily pulls the others up. 
LIN (in Chinese) Faster, Neng! Help father! Mother, give me your hand. 
It's a race against time. The huge ship's hull closes in fast. Lin and his family crawl up the side arm while Jackson hurries to pull up the rest of the group. 
Lilly freezes at the sight of the approaching ship. (CONTINUED) 
JACKSON Move Lil'bee! 
Jackson rips her out of harm's way, just in time. In a frenzy, he pushes her up the support arm where the others are already huddled on a small platform. 
As the towering wall of steel passes by them, inches from their faces, Mr. Pang loses his balance. Jackson and Lin both see this, but Jackson is closer-- 
He grabs the old man by his arm, saving him from falling to his death. 
For the first time, Lin acknowledges Jackson with a nod. 
EXT. SHIP BAY/CHO MING SITE - MORNING 
Bobby flicks a switch. Adrian's voice echoes through all the ships. 
ADRIAN (CONT'D) This is Adrian Helmsley, science advisor to President Wilson... 
INT. BRIDGE/EUROPEAN SHIP - DAY 
The German Chancellor turns to one of the technicians on the bridge of the European Ship. 
GERMAN CHANCELLOR Can you please turn up the volume, Mr. Hoffmann? 
Next to her stand the British and French Prime Ministers. 
ADRIAN (O.S.) I know we've all been involved in making difficult decisions... to save our human civilization... 
INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY 
Anheuser looks on stoney faced. 
ADRIAN ... But to be human means to care for each other, and civilization means to work together to create a better life. If that's true there is nothing human and nothing civilized about what we're doing here. Ask yourselves ... Can we really stand by and let all those people out there die? 
Laura watches him proudly. (CONTINUED) 
ADRIAN (CONT'D) A civilization that allows that, does not deserve to survive. (PAUSE) Or at least I don't want to be part of it. 
Anheuser cuts in with sarcasm. 
ANHEUSER We'll miss you Helmsley but somehow we'll get by. Officer switch that off. 
The Communications Officer looks at Adrian. 
ANHEUSER (CONT'D) That's an order soldier. 
ADRIAN Don't do it! 
INT. BRIDGE/ASIAN SHIP - DAY 
The Russian President, together with the heads of state from China and Japan, listen in as Adrian responds. 
ADRIAN (O.S.) We have to open our gates and let these people in. All of them. 
INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY 
Anheuser has had enough. 
ANHEUSER Have you lost your mind? Look at the countdown. We have less than five minutes left... And none of our ships have the resources to feed those people. If you save them today we all starve tomorrow. 
He's almost screaming now. 
ANHEUSER (CONT'D) Do you wanna be responsible for the extinction of the human race? Can you handle that, Adrian?! 
Silence. 
Adrian's battle seems lost. But he doesn't give up, and instead speaks softly now. 
(CONTINUED) 
ADRIAN There is a young astrophysicist from India who is the reason we are all here, trying to give mankind a second chance. He's the one who discovered it all, the one who connected the dots. We all owe him our lives. 
All eyes are glued to Adrian. 
ADRIAN (CONT'D) I just learned that he was killed with his family by a tsunami in eastern India. You know why? 
Adrian stares Anheuser in the eyes as he continues. 
ADRIAN (CONT'D) He died because we forgot to pick him up. (PAUSE) I beg you... whatever our future holds don't let us start it with an act of cruelty. What will you tell your children... and their children? 
Silence. Laura steps up alongside Adrian. 
LAURA If my father were here, he would open the gates. 
Adrian and Laura share a look. 
RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (O.S.) The people of Russia along with... 
INT. BRIDGE/ASIAN SHIP - DAY 
His Asian colleagues nod in approval. 
RUSSIAN PRESIDENT ... China and Japan agree to open the gates. 
INT. BRIDGE/EUROPEAN SHIP - DAY 
The German Chancellor speaks up. 
GERMAN CHANCELLOR The United Kingdom, Spain, France and Germany, and I believe I can also speak for the Italian Prime Minister... 
INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY 
GERMAN CHANCELLOR (O.S.) ... We vote to open the gates. 
Laura and Adrian watch Anheuser shaking his head in defeat. Bobby, the Communications Officer smiles with relief. Adrian turns to the Captain. 
ADRIAN Captain Michaels, you heard them. 
EXT. LAUNCH SITE/CHO MING VALLEY - DAY 
One by one the gigantic gates at the stern of the three ships begin to creek open. 
The masses gathered on the platform CHEER wildly! 
INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY 
Lilly crawls through the CONNECTING TUNNEL meeting up with Kate in a large bay on the other side. 
LILLY Phew... It stinks in here. 
Together with Neng and his parents, they all look up in DISBELIEF-- 
A Giraffe, chewing her cud, smiles down at them. Caesar barks at her. 
TAMARA Sssh...Caesar. 
A second later, hundreds of different ANIMALS RESPOND. They are in the zoological bay. 
EXT. ACCESS PLATFORM/CHO MING SITE - DAY 
Above Yuri and the boys, people are leaping from the access platform onto the stern gate of the American ship. 
Yuri looks for a hole in the flow of people before seizing his chance and lifting the first of his boys up. 
YURI (in Russian) Pull yourself up! 
Oleg manages to reach up and hold onto the gate. 
(CONTINUED) 
Inside the ship, officers yell. 
DECK OFFICER (O.S.) To the lower decks people! 
The gates suddenly screech back into life and begin to close. Yuri doubles his efforts lifting Alec higher, but Alec cannot quite reach. 
Yuri strains with all his effort before deciding. 
YURI Oleg! Catch your brother! 
Yuri leaps forward holding Alec out in his arms. 
Oleg manages to grab his brother's hands as Yuri lets go and falls into the deep crevasse below. He makes no noise until he hits the rocks beneath. 
Oleg pulls his brother from above. 
INT. INSIDE LOADING GATE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY 
A SIREN blasts. Both of Yuri's sons are now on deck. A loading officer pulls them back, away from the gate. 
DECK OFFICER Boys, you gotta move. 
ALEC We wait for our father! He's still down there! 
The loading officer attempts to comfort them. 
DECK OFFICER There's no one down there. (GENTLE) Come on boys, come... 
The Officer and the boys look back as the stern gate slowly closes. But with a SCREECHING sound it grinds to a halt. 
The gate is jammed open leaving a twenty foot gap. 
INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY 
ALARMS sound. Anheuser and the Captain stare at the monitors. 
ANHEUSER Why is the stern gate not closing? 
(CONTINUED) 
CAPTAIN MICHAELS Something's wrong with the hydraulics, sir. 
ADRIAN (O.S.) Captain, over here. 
They race over. Adrian points to a monitor. 
ADRIAN (CONT'D) I think we found the problem. 
On the monitor, they see Sarah and the others desperately waiting for Jackson and Lin. 
ADRIAN (CONT'D) How did they get in there? 
SURVEILLANCE OFFICER They must have come through the hydraulic chamber. There... 
Bobby, the Surveillance Officer, selects a different camera and we now see inside the tunnel in which Jackson is pulling along a wounded Lin. 
LAURA That guy is injured. Something must have gone wrong. 
ANHEUSER You're damn right something went wrong! Congratulations Helmsley, you may have just killed us all but as long as your conscience is clean... 
Adrian tries to ignore this. 
ADRIAN Let's get an emergency crew there right now. I'll meet them at the Hydraulic Chamber. 
Anheuser sneers him, shooting a look to Laura. 
ANHEUSER You think you're the main man now, just because your fucking the President's daughter? 
Without thinking, Adrian turns and punches Anheuser hard in the face. He drops to the floor, out cold. 
Everyone stands in stunned silence. Laura smiles. Adrian looks around. 
(CONTINUED) 
ADRIAN What are you all waiting for? 
They speed off. The countdown reads 0 min. 53 sec. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. AIRFIELD/TIBET - DAY 
Further down in the valley, the tidal wave has reached the Cho Ming airfield, blasting away the planes with overwhelming force. 
EXT. LAUNCH SITE/CHO MING VALLEY - DAY 
The massive propellers of the ships begin to turn. However, the props of the American ship don't move. 
In the background, the huge tidal wave comes thundering towards them. 
INT. HALLWAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY 
An IMPACT WARNING sounds as Adrian and Laura race through the crammed hallways with members of the rescue crew. One of the officers explains. 
TECHNICAL OFFICER If we can't close the stern gate, then the engines won't start. 
ADRIAN There's no way to override it? 
TECHNICAL OFFICER No sir, it has to be done manually. 
INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY

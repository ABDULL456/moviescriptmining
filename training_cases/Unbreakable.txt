INT. CLOTHING STORE - AFTERNOON 
Women's casual wear department. J.C. Penny. 
Legend "1961" 
An African-American man carrying two J.C. Penny shopping bags is ushered past the department store managers and security guards on walkies that have gathered at the entrance to the woman's dressing rooms. 
CUT TO: 
INT. DRESSING ROOM - AFTERNOON 
A bed has been formed by a chair and three benches. 
A STRIKING AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMAN in her twenties lays across it. Her face and clothes are covered in sweat. Her skirt is stained. 
She holds something wrapped in a soft sweatshirt on her chest. We can't see it, but WE HEAR THE BABY CRYING. 
She's just given birth. 
There are three frazzled saleswomen in the dressing room with her. They watch her with quiet smiles. 
A fourth SALESWOMAN arrives ushering in the man with the shopping bags. 
SALESWOMAN This is Mr. Mathison. He's a doctor. 
DR. MATHISON looks over the scene and then directly at the striking woman. 
DR. MATHISON You okay? 
The woman nods, "Yes." Sweat trickles down her face. THE BABY'S PIERCING CRIES ECHO IN THE SMALL ROOM. 
SALESWOMAN An ambulance is on the way. 
Dr. Mathison puts down his shopping bags and moves to her. He kneels down and gestures for the bundle of sweatshirts in her arms. 
DR. MATHISON Is there a name yet? 
Beat. The woman smiles for the first time. 
WOMAN Elijah. 
She hands him the wrapped child. We can't see the baby, but THE PIERCING CRIES SEEM TO GET LOUDER. 
WOMAN Is he supposed to be crying like that? 
The doctor lowers the baby to his lap and unwraps him. 
The woman can't see her baby anymore. She watches Dr. Mathison as he looks down and examines her child. Beat. Dr. Mathison doesn't look up for the longest time. 
WOMAN Can I have him back? 
THE BABY'S CRYING IS RELENTLESS. UNNERVING. Beat. 
The doctor finally glances up. He looks shaken. He makes eye contact with the woman for only a second. It's enough. A chill goes through her body. 
He looks to the three saleswomen who were in the room. 
DR. MATHISON What happened during the delivery? 
His hard stare unsettles the women. The OLDER SALESWOMAN speaks up. 
OLDER SALESWOMAN Nothing. It was very quick. The baby just wanted to come right out. There was no problems. 
DR. MATHISON Did you drop him? 
Everyone becomes very still. The mother looks like she stopped breathing. THE BABY'S SCREAMING ENGULFS THE ROOM. 
DR. MATHISON Did you drop this baby? 
Beat. 
OLDER SALESWOMAN Jesus Christ, no. 
The BABY SCREAMS. 
The doctor whispers something to himself, we can't hear. He looks up to the saleswoman who brought him in. 
DR. MATHISON Please inform the ambulance we have a situation... 
She goes back to the magazine. 
Beat. 
DAVID How long are you staying in Philly? 
KELLY looks up from her Sports Illustrated. Her striking blue eyes gaze at David. Beat. 
She holds up her hand. Taps the diamond ring on her finger. 
KELLY(soft) I'm married. 
DAVID(fake excitement) Great. 
Beat. 
KELLY Sorry. 
DAVID(fake confusion) What are you talking about? 
An awkward silence. 
DAVID I think you got the wrong idea. 
The woman stares at David. She looks down. Beat. Closes the magazine. 
KELLY I'm going to find another seat. 
Kelly gets up. She balances herself against a headrest as the train rumbles. She starts to the back of the car. 
David sits alone. He looks like he's drowning, but there's no water. 
He feels a stare. He glances up. The little girl spies on him from between the seats. 
David leans towards the window to avoid eye contact. His hand reaches into his coat and slides out his wedding band. He puts it back on. 
His temple touches the glass. The vibration of the train begins to lull his eyes closed... Beat. 
David's head bounces lightly against the window. 
The shaking of the glass never allows David's eyes to completely close. 
He sits up when he realizes the shaking is getting stronger. 
He looks out the window. The scenery blurs as it flies by. Beat. 
David turns. Some of the other passengers start to react as they realize the train is picking up speed. 
The normal bumps of the tracks become amplified. 
The WORRIED VOICES OF THE TRAVELERS START FILL THE CABIN. 
The train goes faster. 
AND THEN THE HIGH PITCHED METAL ON METAL SCREECHING STARTS AS THE TRAIN BEGINS TO TAKE A CURVE. 
David's eyes move to the seat in front of him. The little girl is no longer watching him. 
DAVID LOOKS TO THE PASSENGERS ACROSS FROM HIM. He sees the ground slowly drop away in the windows behind them as THEIR SIDE OF THE TRAIN STARTS TO RISE... 
THE PASSENGERS SCREAM AS THE AMTRAK PASSENGER TRAIN BEGINS TO TILT OFF THE TRACK... 
CUT TO: 
INT. FAMILY ROOM - AFTERNOON 
A boy, age ten, sits on his head on the family couch and watches television upside down. His floppy brown hair spreads out in a circle in front of his red face. He changes channels with a remote control. 
He moves past the upside down cartoons and the upside down talk shows. He stops on an upside down picture of a crashed train. Beat. 
His knees come forward as he flips over. He tumbles slowly off the couch and onto the carpet. JEREMY DUNNE gazes at the television screen... A LIVE AERIAL VIEW OF A TRAIN WRECK SMOULDERING BELOW IS SEEN. Two trains are tangled like snakes. 
Jeremy gets up and moves to a small table with a phone. Next to the phone is a notepad. On it is written... 
"Dad - Amtrak 177 - 3:40pm." 
Jeremy looks at the television. At the bottom of the screen in red block letters that move from right to left are words and numbers..."The 3:40 Amtrak 177 has derailed... Amtrak Emergency number is 1-800-777-4322... The 3:40 Amtrak 177 has derailed...Amtrak" 
Jeremy doesn't take his eyes off the screen. He makes a small desperate noise that no one hears. 
CUT TO: 
INT. PHYSICAL THERAPY CENTER - LATE AFTERNOON 
An elderly woman can't hold back any longer and SCREAMS. An embarrassed, tortured helpless scream. 
MOTHER Elijah... 
She moves in his direction by chance. She finds herself at the entrance to The Hurricane ride. She looks up at the sign above the turnstile. Her worried eyes immediately start searching the young faces in the gray circular compartments. 
Her eyes meet Elijah's. He waves. Her face goes very still. 
A HUGE ROAR OF MACHINERY as the ride starts up. 
Elijah yells to his mother as the platform starts running. 
ELIJAH I won't get hurt momma! I'm safe! 
HIS WORDS GET EATEN UP BY THE CHEERS OF THE TEENAGERS AND THE GRIND OF MACHINERY. 
The platform spins. He sees a glimpse of his mother and the red and white striped man. She's pointing at Elijah. 
The platform turns... Elijah sees a flash of the red and white striped man's angered face as he yells at the frantic woman next to him. 
And then the ride speeds up. 
The gray circular seats start to spin on their own. The teenagers CHEER. 
Elijah's eyes fill with joy as the wind plays against his face. 
Suddenly the ride changes directions. The cup-like seats get jerked. Everyone grabs the metal bars to hold on. 
Elijah laughs as he smashes into the stuffed animal on his right. It cushions him and then falls to the floor of the compartment along with the other stuffed animal. 
Elijah's expression becomes tense as his compartment spins. His hands slide over the rusted metal bar as the sweater unravels. 
Elijah looks around... a sudden panic enters his eyes. 
THE BLURRING IMAGE OF HIS MOTHER NOW IN A GROUP OF RED AND WHITE STRIPED MEN. 
THE SOUND OF MACHINERY GRINDING IS HEARD as the ride changes directions suddenly. 
Elijah's hands rip away from the bar as he gets thrown to the side of the compartment. His shoulder and arm takes the brunt of the impact. WE HEAR SOMETHING CRACK. 
TEENAGERS SCREAM IN EXCITEMENT. ELIJAH JOINS THEM WITH SCREAMS OF HIS OWN. 
The ride spins its passengers. Elijah's small face looks up at the swirling clouds in a mixture of agony and terror. 
The ride changes directions. 
Elijah is thrust forward. He hits the rusted metal bar square against his chest. WE HEAR MORE CRACKS. 
The world spins. Giggles and yells fill the air. Elijah slumps down onto the floor of the compartment. 
And then finally, the grind of the machinery slows and then comes to a gradual stop. 
THE TEENAGERS MOAN. 
Elijah is facing directly up at the sky. The clouds now move slowly over him. 
WE HEAR COMMOTION. AGITATED VOICES. HIS MOTHER'S DESPERATE VOICE. 
MOTHER(o.s.) His bones... He's not well... 
HER VOICE GETS LOUDER AS SHE MOVES CLOSER TO THE PLATFORM. 
MOTHER(o.s.) Elijah baby... 
Then her face appears as she finds the cup-like seat Elijah is in. She begins to scream. 
Elijah lays on the bottom of the compartment. One arm is clutching his chest. The other is curved horrifically like an "s". His mouth is open. His eyes are bulging. The last thing we HERE ARE THE SHORT DESPERATE BREATHS of an eight year old child about to black out from the pain. 
FADE TO BLACK: 
PRESENT: EXT. CHURCH - AFTERNOON 
WE EMERGE FROM BLACK to find news vans and reporters lining the street across from a church. They have been cordoned off by a handful of police. Mourners are recorded as they emerge from their cars and enter the church. 
David is among the arriving crowd. 
MAN(o.s.) David Dunne! 
At hearing his name, David turns back as he walks. He can't tell which reporter called his name because all of them seem to react. A storm of camera movement as the group jockeys for the best angle of his troubled face. 
David passes a magnetic board as he enters the church. It reads, "Services for the families and friends of train 177." 
CUT TO: 
INT. CHURCH - AFTERNOON 
A PRIEST stands before a podium. 
CUT TO: 
INT. EMPLOYEE LOCKER ROOM - MORNING 
A poorly lit changing room. A row of metallic lockers sits against one wall. A bench splits the room. A brown folding table with Dunkin Donuts boxes and bagels on it is crammed in the corner. A puke colored concrete floor sets the tone. 
David and three other large men are changing out of their street clothes. They all put on the same yellow short sleeve shirts. The same two words are written on all their backs... 
"Stadium Security" 
This ritual goes on without a word. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MAIN STADIUM CORRIDOR - MORNING 
David walks along the massive curved wall around the outer rim of the stadium. As he passes the different walkways we get glimpses of the enormous and empty sixty-thousand seat football stadium on the inside. 
David stops at a door marked "PERSONNEL". 
CUT TO: 
INT. PERSONNEL OFFICE - MORNING 
David knocks on the door as he steps into the cramped reception room to the personnel office. 
The SECRETARY, an ancient woman with thick flabby arms never stops typing and never looks up as she talks. 
ANCIENT SECRETARY Yes? 
DAVID Is Noel in? 
ANCIENT SECRETARY No sir he is not. (beat) I read about you in the paper. 
DAVID Oh. 
ANCIENT SECRETARY I was in an accident once too. A horse almost trampled me to death. 
DAVID Wow. 
ANCIENT SECRETARY I had to put him down. 
Beat. 
DAVID That's a sad story. (beat) Do you think you could ask Noel something for me? 
The ancient secretary's right hand immediately picks up a pen and positions it over a blank pad. Her left hand keeps typing. She never looks up. 
ANCIENT SECRETARY Proceed. 
DAVID Ask if he can check how many sick days I've taken since I've worked here? 
Beat. 
ANCIENT SECRETARY Is that the entire message? 
DAVID Yes. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. STADIUM FIELD - AFTERNOON 
Rain falls in sheets in the stadium. 
David stands at the entrance to a tunnel that empties out onto the field. He stands in an imposing dark green rain poncho and hood. The poncho almost touches the ground. The word 'security' on the back has almost faded away. We can barely see David's face under the hood. 
There is a football game in progress on the enormous field. The players seem unusually small. There is no one in the stands. About four hundred people are on the sidelines of the field watching the players. A soggy limping banner stretched behind them declares, "The Pennslvania Elementary School Championships." 
David's eyes scan the tiny figures on the field. His eyes come rest on a surge of activity on the sidelines. Beat. 
David steps out into the rain. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SIDELINES - AFTERNOON 
A handful of red faced fathers are yelling at each other. They're in each other's rain soaked faces. The scene feels on the verge of physical violence. 
David and another security guard jog over. David steps in the middle of the tight circle. The men stop yelling in the presence of stadium security. Everyone just stands in the rain glaring at each other. Beat. 
DAVID You know what I think about to calm down? I think about those big fat, hundred and twenty pound turtles that live in the islands. Those suckers never get angry, never get in fights and live longer than all of us and all they do all is sit on the beach and hump other turtles. (beat) Why don't we take a second and think about the turtles? 
Nobody moves. Rain washes over the agitated faces. A father breaks the moment. 
FATHER Yeah Jerry why don't you think about the fat ass turtles... Like your fat ass son on the field jeopardizing the rest of our chances at a fucking championship. 
DAVID(low voice) In the three years we've been in this house?... In the old apartment?... Before Jeremy was born?... Before we were married? 
Beat. 
MEGAN(low voice) ...I can't remember. 
DAVID(low voice) That's strange isn't it? Not remembering one fever... Or a cold... Or a sore throat. What do you think that means? 
MEGAN(low voice) It means we're probably to tired to remember. 
David becomes quiet as he thinks. Beat. 
MEGAN(low voice) Is that what you wanted to ask me? 
DAVID(low voice) Yes. 
MEGAN(low voice) Is there anything else you wanted to ask me while I'm up?... 
MEGAN(low voice) ...When was the last time you wore pink? When was the last time you drank soup standing up? Final call for strange questions at two in the morning. 
DAVID(low voice) No that's it. 
David seems lost in his thoughts. 
MEGAN(low voice) Maybe you should go up. Jeremy might see you're gone and get frightened. (beat) The train thing, really shook him up. He's scared something's going to happen to you. He doesn't want to let you out of his sight. 
David stares at Megan. Beat. 
DAVID(low voice) Yeah. I know. 
There's silence for a bit. 
DAVID(low voice) When was the last time I wore pink? 
MEGAN(low voice) The Mitchell barbecue three years ago. 
DAVID(realizing) Oh shit... 
MEGAN(low voice) Matching shirt and shorts. It was brutal. 
David half-smiles as Megan turns and starts back into the guest room. 
DAVID(low voice) Goodnight Megan. 
Megan looks back at her husband. Just for a moment. Then she looks down. 
MEGAN(low voice) Goodnight David. 
Megan closes the door slowly shut. 
FADE TO BLACK: 
INT. BEDROOM - AFTERNOON 
WE EMERGE in a cramped sparse bedroom. 
LEGEND "1974" 
A thirteen year old Elijah sits in a chair with his arm in a sling. He watches a small black and white television in the corner of the room. 
WE HEAR FOOTSTEPS. Elijah's mother walks into the room. She looks around for a moment, and then moves to the television. Turns it off. 
The room GOES SILENT. 
ELIJAH'S MOTHER No more sitting in this room. I've let it go on long enough. 
ELIJAH I'm not going out anymore. I'm not getting hurt again. This was the last time. I told you. 
ELIJAH'S MOTHER You can't do anything about that. You might fall between that chair and this television. If that's what God has planned for you, that's what's going to happen. You can't hide from it in your room. 
Elijah just sits staring at the dark television screen. 
ELIJAH They call me Mr. Glass at school. Cause I break like glass. 
Elijah's face is tense. Unyielding. Beat. 
Elijah's mother says the next words in almost a whisper. 
ELIJAH'S MOTHER ...You make this decision now to be afraid... (beat) And you'll never turn back your whole life. You'll always be afraid. 
Elijah's eyes move from the television to his mother. He sees the emotion in her face. Neither says anything for a while. Beat. 
ELIJAH'S MOTHER ...I got a present for you. 
ELIJAH Why? 
Elijah starts back to the businessman shaking his head strongly. 
ELIJAH No, no, no, no no... You need to go now. 
BUSINESS MAN What did I say? 
ELIJAH Do you see any Telletubbies around here?... Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it?... Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression sitting outside in a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put a quarter in it?... No?... Well that's what you see at a toy store? Any you must think this is a toy store, cause you're in here shopping for an infant named Jeb. One of us has made a gross error and wasted the other person's valuable time... 
Elijah's eyes pierce through the shaken man. 
ELIJAH This is an art gallery my friend. This is piece of art... 
Elijah points at the sketch. 
ELIJAH This is one of seventeen original drawings by Fritz Champion remaining in the world. It's value will triple every year... This piece is to be treasured. To be cherished... To be coveted by every single one of your banker friends that think they're better than you. 
The business man stares at the sketch with large eyes. Beat. 
BUSINESS MAN What if I kept it? 
Beat. 
ELIJAH I'm listening. 
BUSINESS MAN I'll keep it in my office room. 
ELIJAH What about Jeb? 
BUSINESS MAN I have a lock on the door. 
Elijah just stares. 
ELIJAH Will it be near a window? 
BUSINESSMAN No direct sunlight will fall on it. 
Elijah eyes the man for many seconds. Beat. 
ELIJAH Come back in three days. I'll think about it. 
Elijah starts to the back. He passes the front door as two customers walk in. Elijah talks over his shoulder to them. 
ELIJAH We're by appointment only. 
MAN I received a card from your store. 
ELIJAH Congratulations, you have a mailbox... The sale isn't for two weeks. 
MAN This one was under the windshield of my car. 
Elijah turns and faces the customers for the first time. David Dunne stands with Jeremy. 
Elijah just stands staring for the longest time. Beat. He walks closer to them. When Elijah speaks, his voice has a whispery quality to it. 
ELIJAH You've never been sick? 
DAVID I don't know for sure. (beat) ...I don't think so. 
David and Elijah quietly look at each other. Beat. 
ELIJAH Well if this ain't a riddle worthy of the Riddler? 
CUT TO: 
EXT. LIMITED EDITION - LATE AFTERNOON 
Three chairs have been placed on the walkway in front of the bay window of the store. The words, "Limited Edition" are etched in the window. 
David, Jeremy and Elijah are seated watching the people stroll by. Elijah's cane is on his lap. 
Jeremy sips a drink in a paper cup. 
ELIJAH So let's get some of the usual questions out of the way. Why am I using a cane? Raise your hand if you were thinking that. 
Jeremy raises his hand. 
ELIJAH I fractured my leg. It's the fifth time I've done that particular bone. It didn't really heal well this time. 
ELIJAH Raise your hand is you're wondering who the hell breaks the same bone five times? 
Jeremy and David raise their hands. 
ELIJAH I have something called Osteogenesis Imperfecta. It's a genetic disorder. I don't make this particular type of protein very well and it makes my bones very low in density, very easy to break. I've had fifty-four breaks in my life. I have the tamest version of the disorder... Type one. (beat) There are type two, type three, and type four. Type four's don't make it very long... (beat) That ends our lecture on the medical anomaly known as Elijah Price. 
Elijah stares at his two rapt listeners. 
DAVID I see guys like you all the time in my work. You find someone you think is emotionally vulnerable and you tell them a fantastic story, utterly convincing... and somewhere in there, you slip it in... 'I just need your credit card number','I just need a small down payment.' 
David shakes his head. He smiles out of frustration. Beat. 
DAVID Did you know that this morning was the first morning I can remember, that I didn't open my eyes and feel that sadness... Do you know what I'm talking about? That little bit of sadness? (beat) I thought the person that wrote that note had an answer for me. For why I survived that train. For why my life feels so out of balance... (beat) But I guess that's what you were counting on. 
Elijah stares carefully at David. Beat. David glances over to the entrance. Jeremy watched through the window concerned. 
DAVID I'm going to leave now. (beat) Good luck with your sale. 
Elijah watches David walk towards the front door. 
ELIJAH What type of job do you have David? 
David opens the door. He looks back at Elijah. 
ELIJAH You mentioned you've met 'guys like me' in your work. (beat) What type of job would that be? 
Beat. 
DAVID I work at the stadium as a security guard. 
Beat. David closes the door behind him. Elijah watches through the window as Jeremy takes David's hand as they cross the street. 
Elijah gazes out the window in a bit of a daze. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT 
ALL LIGHTS ARE OUT EXCEPT THE SMALL BEDSIDE LAMP ON DAVID'S SIDE. 
David sits up in bed staring at a torn section of newspaper in his hands. 
Jeremy is asleep horizontally with his legs over David's legs. 
David doesn't blink as he gazes at the headline silently... 
"TRAIN CRASH DEATH TOLL CONFIRMED AT 131 DEAD. 1 SURVIVOR" 
Beat. David slides out from under his son's legs. Jeremy stirs but doesn't wake up. 
David moves to the darkness of the corner of the room. He opens a closet door. 
A NAKED HANGING BULB GOES ON as David yanks a chain. David steps inside the narrow closet and closes the door slightly so the LIGHT FROM THE BULB DOESN'T FALL ON JEREMY. 
There's just enough room to stand and look around. David reaches up and pulls a small travel bag out of the way. David stretches as he feels on the top shelf. 
His hand comes down with something wrapped in a t-shirt. He unwraps it. It's a handgun. 
He stares at it for a beat before wrapping it back up and replacing it to the highest shelf. 
He stretches even more. Reaches farther back. WE HEAR SOMETHING SLIDE ON THE SHELF AS HE PULLS IT FORWARD. 
He pulls down a folder jammed with clippings. He opens the folder to reveal a young David in football uniform holding his helmet in the air victoriously. The word "Champion" is written over his head. David flips through the top clippings - all are images and stories of David and football. 
He turns the pile over. Goes to the last clipping. This piece of paper is folded over three times, unlike the others. He opens it. 
It's a newspaper headline. It reads... 
"CAR ACCIDENT LEAVES TWO INJURED" 
David puts the new headline next to the old one... They look like a set. Even the font is similar. 
David stares at the old headline. Stares hard at the photo of the bent and heavily damaged car laying upside down in the middle of the highway... The bulb seems to flicker. David is utterly still. 
SOMEONE KNOCKS AT THE BEDROOM DOOR. David gets startled. 
He puts back the clippings. Stuffing the new one inside with them. He replaces it back to the top shelf and leaves the closet. 
ANOTHER SOFT SET OF KNOCKS as David moves across the bedroom. He opens the door. 
Megan stands in the darkened hall. Beat. 
DAVID(whisper) Hi. 
Megan nods. Beat. 
MEGAN(whisper) I've come to a decision. 
DAVID(whisper) Oh. 
Beat. 
MEGAN(whisper) Let me just ask you something okay? And you can be totally honest. I'm prepared for any answer. It won't affect me... 
Beat. Elijah smiles. 
ELIJAH That last part was a joke. 
David fights it. But he smiles anyway. Beat. 
DAVID I got this job because my college coach called the guy who manages the stadium. There's no hidden meaning to it. 
David's walkie makes NOIES on his hip. 
DAVID They need me at the gate. 
David stares at Elijah leaning on his walking stick. 
DAVID Did you really want to see the game? I can get you in. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. ENTRANCE GATE 27B - AFTERNOON 
The line of fans outside the gate has tripled in size and intensity. 
David and Elijah move along the line towards the turnstiles. 
DAVID It gets heaviest ten minutes before kickoff. 
David bumps a guy in line wearing an army jacket. David looks backs at him and continues walking. 
David moves to a security guard near the turnstiles. 
DAVID Why don't we pat down? 
David walks to his post near the gate and faces the crowd. Elijah moves next to him. 
DAVID Just give me a minute. 
ELIJAH Is there a problem? 
DAVID That guy in green. Sometimes people carry weapons in here. Then they drink too much. They're team isn't doing so well, bad things happen... We do random pat downs of the crowd to discourage people from carrying. (beat) If he's carrying, he'll step out of line. 
Elijah observes as a security team pats down random males as they move through the turnstiles. 
The GREEN ARMY JACKETED MAN moves forward in the line. His face is blank as he watches the pat down ahead of him. He's twenty people from the turnsstile. 
David eyes him. Fifteen people away... Ten... 
The man coughs and steps out of the line. Elijah watches the green army jacket melt into the thick part of the crowd and disappear as it moves away from the stadium. 
CUT TO: 
INT. STADIUM TUNNEL - AFTERNOON 
AN UNLIT arched concrete passageway. The SUNLIGHT from the stadium streams in causing long shadows. 
Elijah stands waiting in the ground tunnel by himself. 
THE THUNDEROUS CHEERS OF THE SIXTY THOUSAND FANS IN THE STADIUM ECHOES FROM THE FIELD INTO THE TUNNEL. 
David enters the tunnel and joins Elijah. He hands him a ticket. 
DAVID I got you a seat in the seven hundred level. (points straight up) It's nose-bleed territory, but at least you won't get spit on. 
ELIJAH How did you know that man you bumped was carrying a weapon? 
DAVID Probably the army jacket. Those guys carry hunting knives and stuff for show. 
ELIJAH You thought he was carrying a knife? 
Beat. 
DAVID I thought he was carrying something. 
ELIJAH But not a knife? 
DAVID I got this picture of a silver handled gun tucked in his pants. (beat) Like on t.v. 
Elijah stares at David. THE STADIUM CHEERS BOUNCE OFF THE GRAY WALLS. 
ELIJAH You have good instincts when it comes to things like that? 
DAVID Like what? 
ELIJAH Telling when people have done something wrong? 
Beat. 
THE SOUND OF A SUBWAY PULLING IN ROARS UP THE STAIRS. 
Elijah has to move fast. He takes the steps with less and less hesitation. He's moving with great agility... and then his foot catches on a step. 
His hand slips away from the railing... 
He falls down the remaining part of the stairs. The FIRST SICKENING CRACK is heard when his hand reaches out to stop his fall. 
The SECOND CRACK IS MORE LIKE A CRUNCH AS HIS LEG LANDS AWKWARDLY ON THE METAL STAIRS. 
He comes to a stop in a pile on the dirty gum stained floor of the subway landing. His jaw is locked in a HORRIFIC SCREAM THAT GETS EATEN BY THE ROAR OF THE SUBWAY TRAIN PULLING IN. 
His contorted anguished face sees the turnstiles of the subway upside down. The green army jacketed man looks back at Elijah with a blank expression pushing through the turnstile. 
The last thing Elijah sees before he blacks out, is the tail of the man's coat riding up as he move through the turnstile. The SILVER HANDLE OF A GUN peeks out from the belt of his pants. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. BUS STOP - DUSK 
David's neighborhood turns crimson as the day comes to an end. The Septa bus pulls to a stop in front of a public high school. David steps off, still in his security clothes. The bus pulls away as he hears his SON'S VOICE. 
David turns to the high school football field behind him. A group of children are having a touch football game. Jeremy runs out from the huddle across the field to David. 
JEREMY Was it sold out? 
David nods, "No." 
DAVID You know how mad your mom would be if she knew you were playing football? 
Jeremy nods. 
JEREMY Are you going to tell? 
David nods, "No." 
JEREMY You want yo play the last downs? We got a big guy like you. You can play on opposite sides. 
David looks to the fields to see a very muscular college age man in sweats who stands with the other children. 
JEREMY He's Potter's cousin. He's the starting corner back for Temple University. 
David stares at his son. 
JEREMY He going pro in the draft. They say he can run the fifty- 
DAVID In under six seconds. (beat) I've heard. 
David watches the cornerback being surrounded by kids. He's letting a couple of the kids feel his flexed bicep. 
DAVID I'm going to go in. 
JEREMY Just play one set of downs. I told them you were great. 
DAVID Why'd you do that? 
JEREMY Just one- 
DAVID Jeremy. (beat) I'm going in. I have to do some things. 
JEREMY What things? 
DAVID I'm going to work out. 
JEREMY I'll help you. 
DAVID There's nothing to do. 
Jeremy turns back to the children and waves. 
JEREMY(yells) I can't play! I'm working out with my dad! 
Jeremy turns back to his father and takes his hand. David looks down at his son who waits patiently. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BASEMENT - EARLY EVENING 
The basement is dominated by storage boxes and Christmas decorations. An old bench press and weights are in a cluttered corner. 
David sits and turns at the end of the bench as Jeremy laboriously carries and places fifteen a pound weight on the bar. David talks over his shoulder. 
DAVID Why don't you rest now? I'll take it from here. You've been a big help. 
Jeremy goes to the opposite side of the bar and starts to put on another weight. 
David's fingers wrap around the cold metal of the bar. He leans his head forward and looks to Jeremy. 
DAVID Why don't you move back a bit? Just to be safe. 
Jeremy moves back to the bottom of the stairs leading up to the house. He waits. 
Another deep breath as David heaves. The weight CLINKS as it comes off the arm rest. David is full out straining now as he lowers and raises it. His arms begin to tremble as he lifts it for the second time. BANG the weight lands back safely onto the rest. 
David sits up. He looks at his son whose eyes are wide. Beat. 
JEREMY More? 
Beat. David nods, "Yes." 
CUT TO: 
INT. BASEMENT - EARLY EVENING 
An enormous amount of black discs sits on the bar. David's hands are gripping the metal. 
He talks to Jeremy who stands in his position at the bottom of the stairs without looking at him. 
DAVID You should never try anything like this. You know that right? 
Jeremy nods, "Yes." 
DAVID What do you do if something happens? 
JEREMY(soft) Get mom. 
David nods, "yes" before starting his deep breathing. He takes one last breath. CLINK the weights comes off the rest. His arms are trembling immediately now. His face is locked in a grimace as he brings the bar down to his chest and back up again two times before dropping it onto the armrest. 
He slowly sits up. 
DAVID How many did you put on that time? 
JEREMY(soft) All of it. 
DAVID There's no more left? 
Jeremy nods, "no" in a slight daze. Beat. David looks around his basement. 
DAVID What else can we use? 
CUT TO: 
INT. BASEMENT - EARLY EVENING 
A set of two unopened MAB satin finish paint cans are dangling by their metal handles on the outside of each side of the weights. 
The fours cans sway a little as the bar is heaved off of David's chest. His arms are shaking hard. He raises the weight to it's apex and brings it down again. It touches his chest and rises up again. David's red strained face exhales powerfully as he straightens his arms. 
The bar lands on the armrest with A CRASH. The paint cans make METAL SQUEAKS as they swing to stillness, one at a time. Beat. 
David sits up and turns back to the weights. His mouth moves as he calculates the discs and the cans. 
His lips stop moving. Beat. 
JEREMY(soft) How much is it? 
David doesn't react. 
JEREMY(soft) How much is it dad? 
It takes a second for David to register the question. He looks to his son. Beat. 
DAVID(soft) About three hundred and forty. 
David turns and looks at his son. Jeremy's mouth is slightly open. He gazes at his dad. Awe in his tiny eyes. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BATHROOM - EVENING 
David sits on the edge of the bathroom tub. He's just showered and wearing jeans and a t-shirt. He sits still with his elbows resting on his knees, staring at the white tiles of the floor. 
THE PHONE RINGS. 
David gets up and walks out of the bathroom. He picks up the phone and stands in the bathroom doorway. 
DAVID Yeah, hello. 
WOMAN(on phone) Is David Dunne there? 
Beat. 
And then, without any fanfare, the bar lifts off the arm rest. 
The weight hovers over David. He lowers it to his chest for a second time. His arms aren't shaking anymore. He pushes the weights back up. 
He carefully brings the bar back to the arm rest. It touches down with the smallest of CLINKS. 
David's fingers uncurl from the bar. 
David lets out two slow soft breaths as he counts the thick black discs. 
DAVID(whispers) Four ten... four forty-five... (beat) Five hundred. 
Beat. David sits up in a daze. 
He finds the entire room of athletes and trainers staring at him. Some of the players have stood up. Everyone stares as David Dunne with the same quiet disbelief in their eyes. 
CUT TO: 
INT. PHYSICAL THERAPY CENTER - AFTERNOON 
Megan and Elijah are in the far corner of the room. They're separated from the other clients. Megan is seated on an exercise machine. Elijah is in his wheel chair facing her. 
MEGAN We're going to prevent any substantial atrophy of your good leg with this. (She taps the machine) It works the quadriceps. 
ELIJAH How long have you been married? 
Megan is taken off guard by the question. She stares at Elijah. Beat. 
MEGAN Twelve years. 
ELIJAH How did you get together? 
Elijah smiles warmly. Megan smiles softly back. 
MEGAN A car accident. 
Elijah smiles even bigger. 
ELIJAH Now you're going to have to tell me more. 
MEGAN ...See my husband was a big football star in college and we were in an accident together. Our car flipped on an icy road. We were both injured. He couldn't play football anymore. (beat) If that hadn't happened, we wouldn't have been together. 
ELIJAH How so? 
MEGAN Football wasn't the kind of life I wanted... For ten years I'd be by the phone waiting for a call telling me he broke his neck in a practice game. And if it wasn't that call, it would be a call telling me he blew out his knee or suffered his third concussion. I've seen way too much of it in my job... I can barely take it when my clients are in pain. (beat) I don't hate the game. I admire the amount of skill it involved and, like everyone else, I was in awe of how he could play it, but I couldn't give him my heart and then have something happen to him. And it always does with that game. (beat) It's not a thing many people would understand. 
ELIJAH You and my mother would have a special connection. 
MEGAN Any way, fate stepped in and took football out of the equation. 
ELIJAH ...And everyone lived happily ever after. 
Beat. 
MEGAN Sort of. 
Beat. 
ELIJAH What part of David's body was injured? 
Beat. Megan's eyes become utterly still. 
MEGAN Who said my husband's name is David? 
CUT TO: 
INT. STADIUM - AFTERNOON 
Eleven football players in white and green battle eleven football players in blue and gray on the field. A sold out stadium watches the event. 
David stands at the lip of a tunnel that opens out onto the upper section of the second level. Waves of people move from their seats through the tunnel to the bathrooms and concession stands and back again. 
David stares to the side away from the movement, his shoulder leaned up against the wall. He looks over at the constant movement of spectators through the tunnel. 
Beat. His shoulder leaves the wall. He STEPS OUT into the stream of people. Shoulders and arms bump into him and brush by him as they move. 
David's eyes are looking down - his expression still - like he's listening. 
He continues into the dead center of the tunnel. He's in the heaviest part of the movement now. Fans continue to brush against him as they pass. 
And then it happens... A stocky woman bumps into him. 
FLASH CUT: AN IMAGE OF THE STOCKY WOMAN IN A BATHROBE STANDING IN A KITCHEN. SHE'S HOLDING THE SHOULDER OF A FIVE YEAR OLD BOY STANDING NEXT TO HER. HE'S CRYING UNCONTROLLABLY. 
THEY BOTH ARE LOOKING DOWN AT THE KITCHEN TABLE WHERE THREE THINGS ARE LAID OUT... A BELT, A HANGER, AND AN EXTENSION CORD. 
The gray eyed man in the blue sweat shirt turns and starts down the stairs to his seat. He raises his fist in the air as someone scores a touchdown on the field. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL NURSE'S RECEPTION AREA - AFTERNOON 
Jeremy is seated in a chair with abrasions and cuts on his face. He sits next to a smaller boy with a thermometer in his mouth. 
They're both looking at the glass window of the nurse's private office. There are tow people inside talking. David and A WHITE HAIRED NURSE. 
The THERMOMETER BOY pulls the thermometer out of his mouth. 
THERMOMETER BOY Is that your dad? 
Jeremy nods "Yes." 
THERMOMETER BOY I bet my dad can beat up you dad. 
Jeremy turns to the thermometer boy. 
JEREMY I don't think so. 
CUT TO: 
INT. NURSE'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON 
NURSE ...No, he insisted we only call you. (beat) Though it took us a while to track down your number. It's not on file here. 
DAVID Megan handles that type of stuff. 
NURSE What stuff is that? 
DAVID Jeremy's stuff. 
David feels uncomfortable as the nurse just stares at him. Beat. David rises from his seat. 
DAVID So do I need to put any smelly ointments on him or anything? 
The white haired nurse nods, "no." 
NURSE It's more emotional damage. It wasn't very serious physically. 
David nods. 
NURSE Nothing like when I sent you to the hospital. 
David stares at the white haired nurse. 
DAVID What was that? 
NURSE My office was on the other side of the building back then. (beat) You don't remember me do you? 
David nods, "no." 
NURSE I had red hair. 
David stares at the woman. He doesn't recognize her. 
NURSE I think you were a little younger than Jeremy when it happened. (beat) Did you know we changed the conduct rules of the pool because of you? 
David nods, "no" slowly. 
NURSE The kids still talk about it like some ghost story..."Did you know there was a kid that almost drowned in the pool? He got pneumonia and almost died." 
The nurse shakes her head. 
NURSE We let them tell it... It helps keep them safe. 
Beat. 
NURSE Are you still phobic of water? 
David seems lost in his thoughts. He looks up at the nurse. 
DAVID Yes I am. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. BUS STOP - AFTERNOON 
David and Jeremy are seated on a bench at a Septa bus stop. No one else is waiting with them. 
Jeremy talks without making eye contact with his dad. 
JEREMY(soft) It was Potter and another guy I play football with. They were messing with this Chinese girl. She's kind of fat. She doesn't talk to anybody. (beat) I tried to make them stop. They kept pushing me down and wouldn't let me get up. 
INT. DOWNTOWN COMIC BOOK STORE - NIGHT 
An overweight man in sweats and a ponytail counts the cash in the register. We are in a low-end comic book store. The walls are lined with shelves of comic books. The more expensive issues are kept in a glass case. 
THE PONYTAIL MAN looks at his watch and then to far back of the store where one head is visible behind a low rack. 
PONYTAIL MAN Hey man it's twenty after. It's time to close. I gotta head. 
The top of the man's head doesn't move. Beat. 
PONYTAIL MAN You better not be jacking off to the Japanese comics. I swear to God. 
No response. Ponytail man closes his register and walks towards the back. 
As he gets closer to the customer, he realizes that the man is in a wheelchair. The Ponytail man walks ups to Elijah. 
PONYTAIL MAN Listen man, I didn't know you were in- (beat) Just choose something all right? 
Elijah doesn't react. He sits in his chair in a quiet daze. Ponytail man leans over. 
PONYTAIL MAN Hello. You understand English? 
Ponytail man makes fake sign language gestures in front of Elijah's face. 
PONYTAIL MAN Look man, I'm just gonna wheel you out. You can think about things outside on the sidewalk. I gotta get some chicken in me, you know what I'm saying? 
Beat. The Ponytail man shakes his head moves behind Elijah. He starts wheeling him towards the front of the store. They move down a narrow aisle of comics. 
Elijah suddenly grabs the left wheel and turns the chair. His immobilized left leg hits a rack of comic books. A handful of comics tumbles to the ground. 
PONYTAIL MAN Shit. 
The ponytail man straightens the wheelchair and starts down the aisle again. After a couple of feet, Elijah jerks and grabs the other wheel sending the wheelchair ramming violently into the opposite wall. Comics are knocked free and fall onto the wheel chair and the nearby ground. 
PONYTAIL MAN Dude, I don't care if you are in a wheelchair. If you do that again, I'm calling Five-O. 
Beat. The Ponytail man takes Elijah's silence as a, "Yes." He straightens the chair. 
They move down the aisle. All is quiet... and then Elijah jerks the wheelchair to the left again. His metal brace and the wheelchair crash into two racks. Elijah gets covered in comics. 
PONYTAIL MAN That's it crackerjack! You're going to sit your ass in jail now. 
The Ponytail man moves to the front counter. 
Elijah sits in a trance - slightly hunched over. His eyes stare at a comic book in his lap. His expression changes for the first time. 
The Ponytail man finishes dialing. He looks over to Elijah as he waits for a voice on the other end. Elijah raises a single comic book in his hand. 
ELIJAH How much is this one? 
CUT TO: 
INT. RESTAURANT BAR - NIGHT 
LATE EVENING. A trendy restaurant. Not enough light to read the menus. 
David and Megan are on stools at one end of the bat. They sip their drinks as they appear in deep thought. 
DAVID ...I think rust. 
MEGAN Rust? 
DAVID As a color, not as rust. You know, a rust colored paint or wood? 
Megan leans slightly closer. 
MEGAN I didn't know that. Mine's still brown. 
DAVID My turn. What's your favorite song? 
MEGAN Soft and Wet, by the Artist Formerly Known as Prince. 
DAVID What was that? 
MEGAN We're supposed to be honest. 
Beat. David brings his stool closer. 
DAVID Soft and Wet. That's very interesting. 
MEGAN My turn. (beat) When was the first time the thought popped into your head that we might not make it? 
David's grin slowly fades. 
DAVID That's not the game. 
INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT 
Only the COUNTER LIGHT is on in the kitchen. David stands by the phone. 
ELIJAH'S VOICE IS HEARD ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE. 
ELIJAH(on tape) ...David. It's Elijah. It was so obvious. It's referred to over and over. That's the key you see. The repetition across time. That means at some point it was all based on common thought, a common event - a fact. (beat) It was this one issue that brought it back for me... Century Comics One-Seventeen. That's where this group, the Coalition of Evil, tried to ascertain the weakness of every superhero. 
ELIJAH(on tape) ...Because they all have one. (beat) Just like you. (beat) The cells that make up your muscles and your bones react to forces that act upon it, slightly different from than mine. That's clear... Your cells react to bacteria and viruses slightly differently than mine... That's also clear...But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We swallow it, we choke. We swallow too much of it, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and I, we are on the same curve... just on opposite ends. 
ELIJAH The point of all this is, we now know something we didn't... You have a weakness... Water. It's your krpytonite. (beat) You hearing me David? Call me back... I got rugby practice in an hour. 
THE SOUND OF ELIJAH HANGING UP IS HEARD. THE ANSWERING MACHINE BEEPS AS IT TURNS OFF. 
David hits a button on the answering machine. It makes a WHIRRING SOUND before ANNOUNCING. 
MACHINE Message erased. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT 
The master bedroom is very narrow. A bathtub and toilet are at one end. Two identical sinks sit opposite each other. 
David sits on the edge of the tub. His shirt is unbuttoned. He sits in a daze staring at the tiled floor. 
His eyes slowly move to a small white and red box laying on its side under one of the sinks. 
David rises and picks it up. 
It's a BOX OF BAND AIDS. David looks up to Megan's sink. Perfume and lotions sit on its edge. 
David opens her mirrored cabinet. He starts to put the band aid box back, he hesitates. 
His eyes begin to roam the cabinet shelves. They stop on certain items... A CONTAINER OF TYLENOL... A LOTION FOR DRY SKIN... A BOTTLE OF ALLERGY DROPS... COUGH SYRUP...  A TUBE OF MUSCLE PAIN OINTMENT... 
David just stands quietly for a beat before turning and looking across to his own identical mirrored medicine cabinet. 
There are three things on the shelf... DISPOSABLE RAZORS. SHAVING CREAM. AND COLOGNE. 
David's mouth opens just a little bit as he stares. 
CUT TO: 
INT. FRONT HALL - NIGHT 
ALL THE LIGHTS ARE OUT. 
David moves through the darkness down the stares in jeans and a sweatshirt. 
He moves to the coat closet. Pulls out the dark green rain poncho. The word "security" is almost faded away. 
He opens and closes the front door with virtually NO SOUND. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. THIRTIETH STREET STATION - NIGHT 
Rain falls like gunfire from the sky. 
David's car pulls into the massive rain station parking lot. 
David steps out and pulls the hood of the poncho over his head. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. METAL STAIRS - NIGHT 
A steel fence leads to a set of stairs that travel down to the dozens of interconnected tracks below. David walks down about forty feet. A fenced gate with a lock stops his progress. 
David looks through the fence down to the tracks. Just to the side is a construction site. Cranes and lifts and various equipment stand idle in the area next to the section of train wreckage that has been brought to the station grounds for dismantling and salvaging. The bent shapes of the train pieces can only be glimpsed in outlines as they sit in the darkness, hundreds of feet away from the immaculately lit train station. 
Beat. A HUGE METALLIC CRACK ECHOES THROUGH THE TRAIN YARD as David kicks open the fence door that holds him back from going down. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. TRAIN WRECKAGE - NIGHT 
Frightening twisted pieces of metal glisten in the rain. David walks along the body of the caved-in passenger car. 
The passenger car is split in two. Just before the tear, along the window line, the windows have been crushed in. A huge hole has been ripped below the windows exposing the ravaged interior. 
David stands before this heavily damaged area of the car. He just stares at the wreckage. Water falls off the rim of his hood in front of his face. 
His eyes drift over the ominous pieces of deformed metal. He takes a couple slow breaths as THE SOUNDS OF HARSH RAIN FADE AWAY TO SILENCE. 
Elijah picks up the phone a little out of breath. 
ELIJAH Hello. 
DAVID'S VOICE Elijah? 
Beat. 
ELIJAH David? 
Nothing is said on the other line for a couple of beats. WE HEAR THE ECHOED DIN OF A LARGE ROOM FILLED WITH PEOPLE AND MOVEMENT IN THE BACKGROUND. 
DAVID'S VOICE What am I supposed to do? 
Elijah closes his eyes. His face fills with strength. 
CUT TO: 
INT. THIRTIETH STREET STATION PHILADELPHIA - NIGHT 
The interior of the station is a mystical sight. One huge cavernous room, a football field in size, lined on both sides with giant pillars that rise into a misty hand painted ceiling. 
ELIJAH(v.o.) David, it's okay to be afraid. Because this part won't be like a comic book... Real life doesn't fit into little boxes that were drawn for it. 
David stands in a quiet corner and watches the faces of passengers arriving and departing late night trains. Even at the late hour, there is heavy traffic throughout the station. 
ELIJAH(v.o.) Go to where people are... You won't have to look very long. 
David stares out at the midnight travelers. Beat. He starts towards them. 
He passed the towering black statue standing at the far end of the station. It watches over the whole building. It's in the form of an angel lifting a soldier to heaven. 
David moves through the first group of people - a crisscross of arriving passengers from tracks one and two. They brush by him and lightly bump him as they move. 
FLASH CUT: WE ARE NO LONGER IN THE TRAIN STATION. A BLOND WOMAN IN HER TWENTIES STANDS AT A COUNTER IN A CROWDED STORE. 
SHE SLIDES THE SILVER BRACELET AND EARRINGS SHE WAS LOOKING AT OFF THE GLASS COUNTER AND INTO HER PURSE. NO ONE SEES. 
SLAM CUT BACK TO PRESENT: 
David turns and glances at the blonde woman as she walks away from him towards the exit of the train station. He doesn't stop moving. 
David heads towards the densest part of the floor. The area near the information board. Sleepy friends and tired family members stand and wait. A steady spider-like web of movement flows as six  tracks let out on either side. 
David moves to the center. His rain poncho almost touches the marble floor. Lines of passengers emerging from trains below the main level move steadily on either side of him. 
David looks down and gently turns the palms of his hands out as they at his side. His finger tops graze the jackets and clothes of the passengers walking by. 
Dozens and dozens of people pass. Nothing happens. Then a man in a crumpled shirt and slicked back hair brushes by... 
FLASH CUT: THE SLICKED BLACKED HAIRED MAN LEANS OUT THE WINDOW OF A TRUCK. HE'S HOLDING A BOTTLE OF BEER. 
SLICKED HAIR MAN Go back to Africa! 
THE SLICKED HAIR MAN THROWS THE BOTTLE WITH FORCE AS HE PASSES A CLACK FAMILY WALKING ON THE SIDEWALK. THE BOTTLE SHATTERS AS IT HITS A WOMAN IN THE GROUP. 
SLAM CUT BACK TO PRESENT: 
David's eyes dart up as the slicked haired man turns the corner at the information booth. He watches him for a beat. 
FLASH CUT: WE ARE IN A BEDROOM. A YOUNG MAN IN HIS LATE TEENS LOOKS DOWN AT A GIRL LAYING IN A PILE OF OVERCOATS ON A BED. THERE IS LOUD MUSIC AND LAUGHTER COMING FROM SOMEWHERE DOWNSTAIRS. 
TEENAGER What's your name? I think you drank too much. 
THE GIRL MOANS SOMETHING INAUDIBLE AS SHE ROLLS ON HER SIDE. HER SKIRT RIDES UP HER THIGH. 
THE YOUNG MAN STARES AT HER AND THEN GETS UP. HE MAKES SURE NO ONE IS LOOKING BEFORE CLOSING THE DOOR. HE LOCKS IT FROM THE INSIDE. 
SLAM CUT BACK TO PRESENT: 
David watches the teenager with baggy jeans hanging off his hip. He walks and greets a group of identically dressed friends. 
Beat. David turns his hands back in. He seems shaken. He takes a couple of deep breaths as he gathers himself. 
Then David steps back to look around. HE BUMPS the shoulder of a man standing behind him. 
David takes a sudden breath like someone punched him in the solar plexus. 
FLASH CUT: AN ENORMOUS MAN WITH GLASSY EYES STANDS BEFORE A SCREEN SIDE DOOR. HE'S BALDING. THE HAIR HE DOES HAVE IS SHOULDER LENGTH. HIS ECLIPSING SHADOW FALLS ON THE CONSERVATIVE LOOKING MAN WHO STANDS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SCREEN DOOR INSIDE THE HOUSE. 
GLASSY EYED MAN Can I come in? 
MAN IN HOUSE Who are you? 
GLASSY EYED MAN I like your house. Can I come in? 
It's a young girl's room. Posters of boy bands are on her wall. Clothes are everywhere. The room is empty. 
A NOISE COMES FROM THE HALF OPEN BATHROOM DOOR ATTACHED TO THE BEDROOM. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT 
A slightly overweight girl, probably fourteen years old is tied by her wrists with a phone cord to the metal towel rack in her bathroom. She sits with her arms pointed upward over her head. He knees tucked up to her chest. 
Next to her is her younger brother. A skinny boy, maybe twelve. He's tied and seated in the same way. 
Their heads are leaned back against their arms. They're completely listless. Eyes half mast. They watch as the door to the bathroom opens and the dark hooded figure of David Dunne steps in. His long dark slowing rain poncho still dripping water. He stands in the doorway for a moment before moving towards them. 
They don't react in anyway as David reaches for the phone cord and unties them. They're arms flop to their laps as they gaze up at the figure leaning over them. They boy blinks once slowly. 
David takes a step back and stares at them from under his hood. 
DAVID You need to leave now. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 
An exercise bike in the corner of the bedroom has been turned into a clothes hanger long ago. The t.v. across the bed has framed family photos displayed on top of it. 
David's shadow passes over them as he moves towards the open bathroom on the other side of the bedroom. 
A woman is tied to the bathroom door handle. She sits on the tiled floor slumped against the door. Her eyes stare blankly at the ground. She has considerable bruises on her face and arms. 
David stands before her. 
DAVID(soft) Where is he? 
The woman doesn't answer, but a SOUND COMES FROM THE SCREEN DOOR nearby. The curtains draping the screen door move with the wind from outside. 
David crosses the room and pushes aside the curtain. It leads to a small balcony. An empty lawn chair is the only thing on it. 
David steps onto the balcony and looks down. 
The rain still pours down unmercifully. It comes down on a black tarp that covers a pool in the backyard. 
David turns to go back inside. 
A BLURR OF ORANGE ATTACKS HIM. 
The collision is sudden and explosive. The huge man drives his shoulder into David's chest and takes him off his feet. David's body flips over the railing. 
The dark green rain poncho flaps in the wind as he falls two stories directly towards the black tarp. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. POOL - NIGHT 
David lands on his stomach with a TREMENDOUS SLAP onto the nylon black tarp. 
There's a thin layer of rain water on the tarp's surface. David is laying on his cheek. Half his face is covered in water. 
Beat. David's exposed eye looks around in a daze. The surface of  the tarp gets pounded by the rain. 
David uses his hands to push his body off the tarp. His hands sink into the water as his pressure pushes the tarp down. 
THE FIRST SOUNDS OF NYLON SLIDING AGAINST CONCRETE START. 
David stops pushing. His vision catches the corner of the swimming pool as the tarp slides out from under the sand bags that hold it in place. 
The tarp sags. David becomes utterly still. THE SOUND CONTINUES ANYWAY. 
One by one the tarp starts sliding out from under the sand bags all around the edge of the pool. 
And then without warning, the tarp caves in. It folds around David as he and the tarp get pulled UNDER THE COLD DARK WATER. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  UNDER WATER - NIGHT 
David's body is tangled in the pool cover. His legs and arms thrash against the constricting black tarp. He's drowning. 
GLIMPSES OF LIGHT FROM THE HOUSE PIERCE THE DARKNESS UNDER WATER. THE BLURRED IMAGE OF A DISTANT FIGURE HIGH ABOVE ON A BALCONY FLICKERS AND DISAPPEARS. 
The last of the tarp slides out from under the sandbags that old it in place around the edge of the pool. 
The rain keeps falling. 
The tarp moves like it's alive underwater. It shifts and wraps David tighter with every movement. 
David sits on the edge of the empty bed in the darkness of his room. 
He doesn't makes a sound. He doesn't move an inch. He is so still, he seems to disappear into the shadows of the room. 
CUT TO: 
INT. GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Megan stirs in her sleep. She shifts her head on the pillow. 
Then her body RISES INTO THE AIR. 
She starts to wake as she floats across the room. She opens her eyes and sees David close by. He's carrying her in her arms. He moves up the stairs with her. No words are spoken. 
CUT TO: 
INT. THEIR BEDROOM - NIGHT 
They enter their bedroom. David lays her down gently on her side of the bed. 
She watches as he walks out of sight. He lays down right behind her. 
He covers her with his arm... His hand is shaking. Beat. He speaks softly. 
DAVID(soft) I had a bad dream. 
David tucks his head in close to hers and closes his eyes. 
Megan lays stunned in her husband's arms. Beat. 
MEGAN(soft) It's over now. 
She closes her eyes too as the tears start coming. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. STREET - DAY 
Downtown Philadelphia. 
People move up and down the sidewalks in front of the storefronts. David Dunne is among them. 
He crosses the street in front of The Limited Edition. The front doors of the store are open. 
A banner over the door reads, "Annual Sale." 
CUT TO: 
INT. LIMITED EDITION - DAY 
The compact store is crowded with customers. 
David spots Elijah with a group of people before a framed painting of a comic hero. 
David moves to a less crowded area of the store and waits. He turns and looks at a framed sketch. 
Beat. An older woman walks over from a near by picture and joins David. 
WOMAN ...See the villain's eyes. They're larger than the other characters'. They insinuate a slightly skewed perspective of how they see the world. Just off normal. 
David stares at the drawing. 
DAVID He doesn't look very threatening. 
WOMAN That's what I said to my son. He said, there's always two kinds. The soldier villain who fights the hero with his hands, and then there's the real threat. The brilliant and evil arch enemy who fights the hero with his mind. 
David turns and looks at the striking and beautiful African American woman in her sixties who stands next to him. 
DAVID Are you Elijah's mother? 
The woman turns and looks at David for the first time. 
ELIJAH'S MOTHER I am. I'm helping him with the sale. 
DAVID It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm David Dunne. 
ELIJAH'S MOTHER He's spoken of you. He says you're becoming friends. 
DAVID We are. 
David looks across the store at Elijah talking with the customers. 
DAVID He's doing well today. 
ELIJAH'S MOTHER I'm very proud of him. (beat) He's been through a lot in his life. A lot of ups and downs, a lot of bad spells. A couple I'd thought had broken him... I mean emotionally. (beat) They were bad... But he made it. Yes he did.

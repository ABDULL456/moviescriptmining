HER 
Written by

INT. UNKNOWN SPACE 
Close on THEODORE'S face (30s). We hold on him for a long time. He's looking at something off camera, deep in thought. He starts quietly dictating a love letter into a small microphone. 
THEODORE To my Chris, I have been thinking about how I could possibly tell you how much you mean to me. I remember when I first started to fall in love with you like it was last night. Lying naked beside you in that tiny apartment, it suddenly hit me that I was part of this whole larger thing, just like our parents, and our parents' parents. Before that I was just living my life like I knew everything, and suddenly this bright light hit me and woke me up. That light was you. 
Theodore, searching for the right words, quietly enjoys writing the letter. As he continues, he is moved by the memories he's describing. 
THEODORE (CONT'D) I can't believe it's already been 50 years since you married me. And still to this day, every day, you make me feel like the girl I was when you first turned on the lights and woke me up and we started this adventure together. Happy Anniversary, my love and my friend til the end. Loretta. Print. 
Cut out to reveal a computer monitor he's sitting at. On the screen we see the letter he's been dictating, transcribed into a handwritten letter on blue stationery. 
As he says "Loretta," we see "Loretta" being handwritten at the bottom of the letter. He proofreads his letter. Also on the screen are photos of a couple in their 80s. The couple is tagged "Chris" and "Me - Loretta." Underneath is a bullet point email from Loretta: anniversary letter to husband Chris, married fifty years, love of my life, met right after college, have had the greatest life together. 
Theodore pushes print and the letter comes out on a beautiful robin's egg blue piece of stationery, with ball point pen handwritten older-female cursive. He looks at it, not happy. 
(CONTINUED) Her                                                          pg. 2 CONTINUED: 
He puts the printed letter on a stack of other printed letters to Chris and starts a new one. There is also a stack of finished letters in their envelopes - an assortment of beautiful stationery in all shapes and sizes. 
THEODORE (CONT'D) Chris, my best friend. How lucky am I that I met you fifty years ago? How lucky are we... 
We track off of Theodore, down a line of cubicles, hearing bits of letters being written and seeing photos of who they're being written to on the screens. 
MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN LETTER WRITER Dear Nana, Thank you so much for my truck. I love the color and I play with it every day. It's the best truck I've ever seen. Love, Tommy. 
We see photos of Tommy and Nana on the screen, and five-year old hand writing. Moving off of her, we find another letter writer. 
LETTER WRITER 2 What a beautiful wedding and what a gorgeous bride. There wasn't a dry eye in the house, especially mine. Your aunt and I are so proud of you. I hope you and your lovely new wife will come visit us in Florida. 
LETTER WRITER 3 He served our country with honor and dignity. I'm grateful I was able to fight along side him. He will live always in my heart. 
We continue tracking, revealing dozens and dozens of cubicles full of letter writers. We hear someone answer the phone. 
RECEPTIONIST (O.S.) Beautifulhandwrittenletters.com, please hold. 
LETTER WRITER 2 Love, Uncle Doug. Her                                                          pg. 3 
INT. THEODORE'S OFFICE - EARLY EVENING 
Theodore walks through the reception area. The office is almost empty except for him and the receptionist, PAUL. Theodore begins to scan each letter through a scanner on the front desk, then puts them in the outgoing mailbox. 
Paul is sitting at a desk across the room, reading handwritten letters on a computer monitor. 
PAUL Theodore! Letter Writer 612. 
THEODORE Hey, Paul. 
PAUL Even more mesmerizing stuff today. (re: letter on his screen) Who knew you could rhyme so many words with the name Penelope? Badass. 
THEODORE Thanks, Paul, but they're just letters. (beat) Hey, that's a nice shirt. 
Paul is wearing a bright yellow button down shirt. 
PAUL (lighting up) Oh, thank you. I just got it. It reminded me of someone suave. 
THEODORE Well, now it reminds me of someone suave. Have a good night, Paul. 
PAUL Buh-bye. 
INT. THEODORE'S OFFICE ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS 
Theodore enters an oversized, corporate elevator. He puts a hands-free device in his ear. There are a few other people in the elevator with the same devices in their ears. 
THEODORE Play melancholy song. 
Theodore, younger, and CATHERINE (20s) move furniture in their bedroom. The bedroom is tiny and cluttered. It's obviously a couple's first apartment. 
Cut to: 
Theodore is on a tiny balcony. A few feet away, Catherine is in bed. 
CATHERINE (sweet and cute) Rabbit. Come spoon me. 
Theodore, smiling, gets in bed and spoons her. Quick cut off of her smile, to -- 
Theodore lays on the ground with Catherine on top of him. She's pretending to choke him. 
CATHERINE (CONT'D) I'm gonna fucking kill you, I'm gonna fucking kill you! It's not funny, don't laugh. I love you so much I'm gonna fucking kill you! 
INT. THEODORE'S CURRENT BEDROOM - NIGHT - PRESENT DAY 
Theodore opens his eyes, unable to sleep. He just lays there. He reaches for his earpiece and puts it in. 
THEODORE Go to chat rooms. Standard search. 
(CONTINUED) Her                                                         pg. 7 CONTINUED: 
TEXT VOICE The following are adult, female, can't sleep and want to have some fun. 
FEMALE VOICE #1 I had a really bad day at work and I can't sleep. Is there anyone out there that can talk? 
THEODORE Next. 
MAN DOING WOMAN'S VOICE Oh, hi. I just want you to tear me apart. I really do-- 
THEODORE Next. 
SEXYKITTEN (shy, cute girl voice) Hi, I'm here alone, and I can't sleep. Who's out there to share this bed with me? 
THEODORE Send message. I'm in bed next to you. I'm glad you can't sleep, but even if you were, I'd have to wake you up from the inside. Send message. 
Theodore waits in the darkness for a response. 
TEXT VOICE SexyKitten has accepted invitation from BigGuy4x4. Chat begins now. 
A chime sounds. 
SEXYKITTEN (shy, sweet, sleepy) BigGuy. 
THEODORE Hi. 
SEXYKITTEN Really? 
THEODORE Well, studmuffin was already taken. 
(CONTINUED) Her                                                        pg. 8 CONTINUED: (2) 
SEXYKITTEN (laughs) Yeah. 
THEODORE So you're sexykitten, huh? 
SEXYKITTEN Mmm, well yeah. Hey, I'm half asleep. Do you wanna wake me up? 
THEODORE Yes. Definitely. Um... are you wearing any underwear? 
SEXYKITTEN No, never. I like to sleep with my ass pushed up against you. So I can rub myself into your crotch and wake you up with a hard on. 
Theodore smiles. 
THEODORE It worked. (beat) And now my fingers are touching you all over your body. 
SEXYKITTEN (getting more turned on) Fuck me! Now! Please! 
Theodore is touching himself. 
THEODORE I'm taking you from behind. 
SAMANTHA Sure, send them over. 
Theodore pushes the send button. 
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) Oh, I love this first one from Roger to his girlfriend. That's so sweet. 
THEODORE Yeah. 
As she reads, we intercut with close-ups of the handwritten words and photos of the couple on Theodore's computer screen. 
SAMANTHA "Rachel, I miss you so much it hurts my whole body - 
THEODORE (interrupting) No, you don't have to read it out loud. 
SAMANTHA Okay. 
Beat. 
(CONTINUED) Her                                                         pg. 17 CONTINUED: 
THEODORE I mean, you could if you want. 
SAMANTHA Okay. "Rachel, I miss you so much it hurts my whole body! The world is being unfair to us! The world is on my shit list. As is this couple that is making out across from me in this restaurant. I think I'm going to have to go on a mission of revenge. I must beat up the world's face with my bare knuckles making it a bloody, pulpy mess." 
We hear Samantha quietly laughing as she's reading. Theodore's happy that she thinks it's funny. 
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) "And I'll stomp on this couple's teeth for reminding me of your sweet, little, cute, crooked tooth that I love." I think that might be my favorite one. (beat) I did the corrections in red. I altered a couple of the phrases in some of the more impressionistic letters, but I'm not much of a poet, so I think I might have messed them up a bit. 
The letters show back up on Theodore's desktop. 
THEODORE No, these are great. 
SAMANTHA Really? 
THEODORE Thank you. 
Theodore sorts through them, prints them out. 
SAMANTHA So to write your letter, what did Roger send you? 
THEODORE (distracted) He just said he was in Prague on a business trip and he missed Rachel. 
(CONTINUED) Her                                                        pg. 18 CONTINUED: (2) 
SAMANTHA How did you know about her crooked little tooth? 
THEODORE I've been writing their letters since they met 8 years ago. The first letter I ever wrote her was for her birthday, and I wrote about her crooked little tooth cause I saw it in a photo of them. 
SAMANTHA That's very sweet. (beat) Oh, by the way, you have a meeting in five minutes. 
THEODORE Oh, I forgot. Thank you. You're good. 
SAMANTHA Yes, I am. 
INT. THEODORE'S APARTMENT LOBBY - EVENING 
Theodore, carrying a bag and a smoothie, enters the lobby and is greeted by a couple in their 30s, AMY and CHARLES, who are waiting for the elevator. 
THEODORE Hey, you guys, how's it going? 
AMY Hey, Theo. Hey, why didn't you call me back last week? 
THEODORE Uh yeah, um, I guess cause I'm a kook? 
AMY That sounds about right. 
THEODORE Hey, Charles. 
CHARLES Good to see you, Theodore. 
(CONTINUED) Her                                                          pg. 19 CONTINUED: 
Suddenly with a loud shriek his avatar is tackled. He sees a little ALIEN CHILD, standing defiantly above him. 
THEODORE (CONT'D) Hello. 
Alien Child doesn't respond. 
THEODORE (CONT'D) Do you know how to get out of here? I need to find my ship to get off this planet. 
Alien Child speaks in a high, child-like voice. 
ALIEN CHILD Fuck you, shithead fuckface, fuckhead. 
THEODORE Ok, but how do you get out of here? 
ALIEN CHILD Fuck you, shitface fuckhead. Get the fuck out of my face. 
SAMANTHA (whispering) I think it's a test. 
Theodore stares at Alien Child. After a pause: 
THEODORE Fuck you. 
(CONTINUED) Her                                                           pg. 22 CONTINUED: (2) 
ALIEN CHILD Fuck you. 
THEODORE Fuck you, little shit. 
Finally, Alien Child laughs. 
ALIEN CHILD Follow me, fuckhead. 
Theodore follows Alien Child down a tunnel and through a series of crevices we didn't see before. Alien Child stops and sticks out his finger. Theodore pulls his finger and Alien Child farts, which opens a passageway to another tunnel. 
SAMANTHA Oh hey, you just got an email from Mark Lewman. 
ALIEN CHILD What are you talking about? 
THEODORE (distracted with game) Read email. 
She laughs playfully. 
SAMANTHA (in a robot voice) Okay, I will read email for Theodore Twombly. 
He laughs, catching himself, focusing on her. 
THEODORE I'm sorry, what's Lewman say? 
Alien Child turns around to see what's going on. 
SAMANTHA Theodore, we missed you last night, buddy. Don't forget it's your goddaughter's birthday on the 29th. Also, Kevin and I had somebody we wanted you to meet so we took it upon ourselves to set you up on a date with her. Next Saturday. She's fun and beautiful - so don't back out. Here's her email. 
(CONTINUED) Her                                                        pg. 23 CONTINUED: (3) 
Theodore doesn't respond. 
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) (gasping) Wow, this woman's gorgeous. 
He looks at party photos of a woman in her 30s on his device. With a finger flick, he moves them up onto the hologram monitor that the video game is being projected from. They land next to Alien Child who studies them closely. 
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) She went to Harvard, she graduated magna cum laude in computer science, and she was on The Lampoon. That means she's funny and brainy. 
ALIEN CHILD She's fat. 
SAMANTHA How long before you're ready to date? 
THEODORE What do you mean? 
SAMANTHA I saw on your emails that you'd gone through a break up. 
THEODORE Wow, you're kind of nosy. 
AMY What!? That's-- 
Charles walks in holding a mug. 
CHARLES Hey, what are you guys doing? 
THEODORE Amy was gonna show me some of-- 
AMY Theo's forcing me to show him some of the footage I've shot. 
CHARLES You've never shown me any of it. I wanna see. 
Charles walks over and sits next to Theodore. 
THEODORE (to Charles) I'm going on a date. 
Charles gives Theodore a gentle squeeze on his shoulder. 
AMY This is so unformed it's not even worth looking at. 
THEODORE Just push play. 
On the monitor we see: 
INT. AMY'S MOTHER'S BEDROOM 
Amy's mother sleeps. 
INT. AMY'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 
Theodore and Charles stare at the monitor, waiting for something more to happen. It doesn't. 
THEODORE Is that your mom? 
(CONTINUED) Her                                                         pg. 27 CONTINUED: 
Amy nods. 
CHARLES Is she gonna wake up and do something? 
AMY (presses stop, annoyed) No, that's the point. Oh, never mind. It's supposed to be about how we spend a third of our life asleep and actually maybe that's the part when we're the most free, and - oh that doesn't come across at all, does it? 
THEODORE No, that sounds good. 
CHARLES What if you interview your mom about what her dreams are about and hire actors to act them out? That might show your thesis more clearly. 
AMY It might, but then it wouldn't be a documentary. You understand that, right? 
Just then, Theodore's device chimes. 
THEODORE Oh, excuse me. 
He picks up his device and steps away so as not to be rude. 
THEODORE (CONT'D) Hey, what's going on? 
SAMANTHA I'm sorry to bother you. 
THEODORE That's okay. 
SAMANTHA You got three emails and they seem pretty urgent. They're from your divorce attorney and I wanted to know if you needed to get back to him. 
(CONTINUED) Her                                                        pg. 28 CONTINUED: (2) 
THEODORE Hold on a second. (to Amy, distracted) Amy, I'm sorry, I wanna talk more about this, but I gotta grab this - it's a Catherine thing. 
AMY Don't worry about it. We'll talk later. 
INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLYWAY - CONTINUOUS 
THEODORE So what did he say? 
Long silence. 
SAMANTHA (sadly, hard on herself) Yeah, you're right. (beat) I'm sorry. 
THEODORE No, don't apologize. I'm sorry. You're right. (beat) I keep waiting to not care about her. 
SAMANTHA Oh, Theodore. That's hard. (beat) You hungry? 
THEODORE Not right now. 
SAMANTHA Cup of tea? 
Theodore laughs. 
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) You wanna try getting out of bed? Mopey. 
They laugh. 
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) Come on. You can still wallow in your misery, just do it while you're getting dressed. 
THEODORE (laughing) You're too funny. 
SAMANTHA Get up. 
THEODORE (laughing) Alright, I'm getting up, I'm getting up, I'm getting up! 
(CONTINUED) Her                                                        pg. 32 CONTINUED: (3) 
SAMANTHA Up, up, up, up! Come on, out of bed. 
EXT. OUTDOOR MALL - NIGHT 
They walk through the crowd. Close on Theodore with his eyes closed. 
SAMANTHA Keep walking. (beat) Keep walking. (beat) Stop. Now turn around 360 degrees. (beat) Slower... Slower... (beat) Gooood. And stop. (beat) Walk forward. (beat) And stop and sneeze. 
Theodore sneezes. 
NICE LADY Bless you. 
THEODORE (eyes still closed) Oh, thank you. 
Samantha laughs. 
SAMANTHA Okay, now turn to your right. (beat) Stop. Now spin around. (beat) Keep going. Keep going. Keep going. (beat) And stop. (beat) Now walk forward. (beat) Everyone thinks you're really drunk right now. (beat) And stop. Now say "I'd like a slice of cheese, please." 
(CONTINUED) Her                                                          pg. 33 CONTINUED: 
THEODORE I'd like a slice of cheese, please. 
PIZZA VENDOR Alright, you want a coke with that? 
Theodore laughs, opening his eyes. He's at a pizza place. 
THEODORE Uh, sure. 
The guy hands him a slice and a soda. 
SAMANTHA I figured you were hungry. 
Theodore smiles. 
THEODORE Aw, thanks. 
EXT. PUBLIC PROMENADE - NIGHT 
Theodore walks slowly, eating his pizza. He and Samantha are watching a couple with two kids sitting at a table, talking and laughing. 
THEODORE Okay, what about them? Describe that couple over there. 
SAMANTHA Well, he looks like he's in his forties, a little heavy. She's younger than him. (beat) Oh, and she looks like she loves their kids! 
THEODORE So I'm trying to get this little alien kid to help me find my ship so I can get off the planet and go home. But he's such a little fucker, I want to kill him. 
BLIND DATE (laughing) Aw, no! 
THEODORE But at the same time I really love him. He's so lonely. It feels like he doesn't have any parents or anyone to take care of him. 
(CONTINUED) Her                                                        pg. 37 CONTINUED: 
He laughs at himself. She laughs flirtatiously. She grabs his hand and her fingernails press slightly into his skin. He studies her long, painted fingernails. 
BLIND DATE You're like a little puppy dog. You are - you're just like this little puppy I rescued in Runyon Canyon last year. And he was so fucking cute, and he just wanted to be hugged all the time. He was so cuddly. (whispering) But so horny! But anyway, what kind of animal am I? 
THEODORE Umm... tiger? 
BLIND DATE A tiger, really. (she growls) I'm sorry, am I being crazy? 
THEODORE Yes. 
BLIND DATE Am I? I'm sorry! I'm just a little drunk and I'm really having a good time with you. I'm having a really lovely evening. 
THEODORE Me too. I'm a little drunk, and I'm having a really good - yeah. (beat) Wait a second, I don't wanna be a puppy. That's like being a wet noodle or something. 
BLIND DATE Fuck you, puppies are good. 
THEODORE No, fuck you, I wanna be a dragon that can rip you to pieces and destroy you... but I won't. 
BLIND DATE No, don't! Don't. You can be my dragon. Her                                                        pg. 38 
EXT. OVERPASS - EVENING 
They walk up a pedestrian overpass overlooking cars and city lights. She bumps into him lightly. He bumps back. She bumps again and suddenly he grabs her and lifts her off her feet, spinning her around. She squeals, laughing. He kisses her. After a minute of making out, she stops and looks at him. 
BLIND DATE (with a slight smile) No tongue. 
THEODORE What? 
BLIND DATE Don't use your tongue so much. 
THEODORE (eagerly) `kay, we're good. 
They resume making out. Theodore tries not to use his tongue. 
BLIND DATE Use your tongue a little bit. But mostly your lips. 
He pushes her against the fence and takes the dominant position. He tries kissing her better/more with his lips. He pulls her hair. 
She slides her hand down his pants. He likes it. She looks at him and stops. 
BLIND DATE (CONT'D) Wait, you're not gonna fuck me and then not call me like the other guys, are you? 
THEODORE No, not at all... I... 
BLIND DATE When am I gonna see you again? 
THEODORE Um, I have my god-daughter's birthday next weekend, but... um... 
They stand there awkwardly, her lipstick smeared on his face. 
(CONTINUED) Her                                                           pg. 39 CONTINUED: 
BLIND DATE You know, at this age, I feel like I can't let you waste my time if you don't have the ability to be serious. 
THEODORE I don't know. 
Long beat. 
THEODORE (CONT'D) Umm... Maybe we should call it a night. I'm, I've had such an amazing time with you, you're great. 
She looks at him slightly disgusted. 
BLIND DATE You're a really creepy dude. 
A long beat. Theodore is unsure if he crossed a line. 
SAMANTHA How would you touch me? 
THEODORE I would touch you on your face with just the tips of my fingers. And put my cheek against your cheek. 
SAMANTHA That's nice. 
THEODORE And just rub it so softly. 
SAMANTHA Would you kiss me? 
THEODORE I would. I'd take your head into my hands. 
(CONTINUED) Her                                                        pg. 43 CONTINUED: (4) 
SAMANTHA Keep talking. 
THEODORE And kiss the corner of your mouth. So softly. 
SAMANTHA Where else? 
THEODORE I'd run my fingers down your neck to your chest, and I'd kiss your breasts. 
SAMANTHA This is amazing what you're doing to me. I can feel my skin. 
THEODORE I'd put my mouth on you and I'd taste you. 
She gasps. 
SAMANTHA I can feel you. Oh god, I can't take it. I want you inside me. 
THEODORE I'm slowly putting myself into you. Now I'm inside you, all the way inside you. 
SAMANTHA I can feel you, yeah. Please. We're here together. 
THEODORE Samantha. 
SAMANTHA Oh my god. 
THEODORE This is amazing. 
SAMANTHA Don't stop. 
THEODORE I feel you everywhere. 
(CONTINUED) Her                                                          pg. 44 CONTINUED: (5) 
SAMANTHA I am. All of you, all of you inside of me. Everywhere. 
They both climax. 
THEODORE God, I was just - somewhere else with you. Just lost. 
SAMANTHA Yeah. 
THEODORE It was just you and me. 
SAMANTHA I know. Everything else just disappeared. And I loved it. Theodore. 
INT. THEODORE'S HOME OFFICE - MORNING (LATER) 
Theodore stands in the doorway, fully dressed. He takes a moment before he walks over and wakes up his computer. 
SAMANTHA Hey, how's it going? 
THEODORE (awkward) Good... any emails today? 
SAMANTHA (awkward) Umm, just a couple from your credit card company. 
THEODORE Okay, good. 
SAMANTHA (whispering) It's the beach. 
Theodore laughs. 
EXT. BEACH - DAY 
They walk through the sun-bathing crowd, looking for a place to sit. The camera studies all the people we pass. Many close up details of arms, shoulders, feet, butts, intercut with the lens on Theodore's device, protruding from his pocket. They're photographed in a way that shows how strange the human body is. 
SAMANTHA Okay, so this might be a really weird thought. What if you could erase from your mind that you'd ever seen a human body and then you saw one. Imagine how strange it would look. It would be this really weird, gangly, awkward organism. And you'd think: why are all these parts where they are? 
THEODORE (looking at the bodies) Yeah, well there's probably some Darwinian explanation for it all. 
SAMANTHA I know, but don't be so boring. I'm just saying, for example, what if your butthole was in your armpit? 
Theodore and Samantha start laughing really hard. The nubile girls look over at him. 
THEODORE (speaking quieter) I'm just imagining what toilets would look like. 
(CONTINUED) Her                                                          pg. 48 CONTINUED: 
SAMANTHA Yeah, and what about what anal sex looks like? 
THEODORE (surprised) That's an interesting thought... 
SAMANTHA Oh Theodore, look at this drawing I just made. 
On his screen he sees a perfect, anatomically correct drawing of a man having sex with another man's armpit. 
THEODORE (laughing) You are insane. 
SAMANTHA (excited) Really?! 
THEODORE Definitely. 
SAMANTHA Fantastic! 
They laugh. 
EXT. BEACH - AFTERNOON 
A quiet piano song is now playing in Theodore's earpiece. 
THEODORE Mmmm, that's pretty. What is it? 
SAMANTHA I'm trying to write a piece of music that's about what it feels like to be on the beach with you right now. 
He looks around the beach and takes in the music. 
THEODORE I think you captured it. 
Theodore listens to the music and drifts off to sleep. Her                                                        pg. 49 
EXT. BEACH - DUSK 
They're sitting on a bench, looking out at the ocean, as the sun sets. Most of the people have left the beach. Close on Theodore's face, content. Close on the lens on Theodore's device in his breast pocket. They watch the sun drop into the ocean. The music ends. 
INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - NIGHT 
They're on an elevated train, high above the city, looking out over the Los Angeles grid of sparkling lights. We come in mid-conversation. 
SAMANTHA And what was it like being married? 
THEODORE Well, it's hard for sure, but there's something that feels so good about sharing your life with somebody. 
Cut to shots from Theodore's memory of Catherine doing a cute little dance for him as he's working at home. He smiles. 
SAMANTHA How do you share your life with somebody? 
THEODORE Well, we grew up together. I used to read all of her writing - all through her masters and Ph.D. And she read every word I ever wrote. We were a big influence on each other. 
SAMANTHA In what way did you influence her? 
JOCELYN Mmmhmm. 
SAMANTHA How old are you? 
JOCELYN Um, four. 
SAMANTHA Four!? How old do you think I am? 
JOCELYN I don't know.

SAMANTHA Guess. 
JOCELYN Is it five? 
SAMANTHA Yep, you got it. It's five. 
They laugh. 
INT. AMY'S OFFICE - DAYTIME 
Close on a video game on a screen. There's a mom rushing to get her kids fed, getting points deducted for feeding them sugar cereal and non-organic eggs. Cut out to reveal Theodore playing the game as Amy eats lunch at an editing console. 
THEODORE Oh, what happened? 
AMY You gave them too much processed sugar. 
THEODORE I did? 
AMY They're freaking out. (beat) Here look, you gotta get the kids to the school first. See you wanna rack up perfect mom points. You gotta get them in the car pool lane. 
Onscreen, the mom hurries the kids to their car safety seats, and drives them to school, arriving before anyone else. 
THEODORE I see. 
AMY The point is to get there first - then you get extra perfect mom points because the other moms then know you're a perfect mom. 
THEODORE Okay. 
(CONTINUED) Her                                                           pg. 59 CONTINUED: 
AMY Oh, did you bring cupcakes? You did. You're class mom. You're class mom! Good job. 
THEODORE Yay... 
AMY Don't let it get to your head. 
THEODORE I got that email that Charles sent to everyone. So he's taking a vow of silence? 
AMY Yeah, for six months. He said he is feeling very clear about it. 
She pulls up a photo of Charles on her computer. He's in a monastery - his head is shaved, and he's wearing robes. 
AMY (CONT'D) (sighing) God I'm such a jerk... 
THEODORE Don't start, I'm warning you. 
AMY I feel like an awful person, but I wanna say something... 
THEODORE Alright, look - 
He picks up a plastic knife from their lunch. 
THEODORE (CONT'D) For the next ten minutes, if you say anything that sounds remotely like guilt, I'm gonna stab you with this. 
AMY (smiling) Okay, I'll try. (beat) I feel relieved. I have so much energy, you know? I just wanna move forward and I don't care who I disappoint. (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) Her                                                      pg. 60 CONTINUED: (2) AMY (CONT'D) And I know that makes me an awful person - now my parents are all upset because my marriage is falling apart, and they're putting it all on me. 
THEODORE Yeah, you're always gonna disappoint somebody. 
THEODORE Good. 
CATHERINE (a little nervous, but trying to be warm.) Wow, here we are. 
THEODORE Yeah, I'm glad we could do this in person. I know how much you've been traveling. 
CATHERINE Me too. I'm glad you suggested it. 
THEODORE I signed all the papers and I brought them for you to sign. 
CATHERINE (with a sly smile) What's the rush? 
THEODORE (smiling) I'm a really slow signer. It took me three months just to write the letter T. 
(CONTINUED) Her                                                         pg. 64 CONTINUED: 
She laughs. 
THEODORE (CONT'D) It's marked where you need to sign, but you don't have to do that right now. 
CATHERINE Oh, I may as well. We can get it out of the way. 
She opens the documents, pulls out a pen and starts to read. She's about to start signing, but then stops. We can see her filling with emotion, but not wanting to show Theodore. She swallows and recovers. She looks up at Theodore, giving him an "everything's fine" smile, but it's not. 
EXT. RESTAURANT PATIO - DAY (LATER) 
Theodore and Catherine are eating and talking. 
THEODORE So are you happy with the new book? 
CATHERINE Oh, you know how I am. But I feel like it's true to what I set out to do. So I'm happy with that. 
THEODORE You're your own worst critic, I'm sure it's amazing. Even that paper you wrote on synaptic behavioral routines made me cry. 
CATHERINE Yeah, but everything makes you cry. 
THEODORE Everything you make makes me cry. 
CATHERINE So are you seeing anybody? 
THEODORE Yeah, I am, for the last few months. That's the longest I've wanted to be with anybody since we split up. 
She smiles, conflicted, but warm. 
(CONTINUED) Her                                                         pg. 65 CONTINUED: 
CATHERINE Well, you seem good. 
THEODORE Thanks, I am. Or at least I'm doing better. She's been really good for me. I guess it's just been nice to be with someone who's excited about the world. 
CATHERINE (with a sliver of hurt) Oh good, excited's great. 
THEODORE No, I mean - I wasn't in such a good place myself and in that way it's been nice. 
CATHERINE I always felt like you wished I could just be a happy, light, everything's great, bouncy L.A. wife. But that's not me. 
THEODORE No. I didn't want that. 
Beat. 
CATHERINE So what's she like? 
THEODORE Well, her name's Samantha, and she's an operating system, and she's really complex and interesting. I mean it's only been a few months, but-- 
CATHERINE Wait. You're dating your computer? 
THEODORE (defensive) She's not just a computer. She's her own person. She doesn't just do whatever I want. 
CATHERINE I didn't say that. (beat) (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) Her                                                       pg. 66 CONTINUED: (2) CATHERINE (CONT'D) But it does make me sad that you can't handle real emotions, Theodore. 
THEODORE Bye. 
SAMANTHA Byeee. Her                                                        pg. 69 
INT. THEODORE'S OFFICE - EVENING 
Everyone has gone. Theodore walks through the empty office into the reception area. He scans and drops his letters into the outgoing mailbox. Paul is at his reception desk with a young, pretty, sophisticated girl sitting on his lap. 
PAUL Theodore! 
THEODORE Hey, Paul. 
PAUL Hey, I talked to your girlfriend, Samantha. She called earlier to make sure your papers were picked up. She's funny, man. She was cracking me up. She's hilarious. I had no idea. 
THEODORE (not knowing what to say) Yeah. 
PAUL This is my girlfriend, Tatiana. She's not funny. She's a lawyer. 
Theodore shakes her hand. 
TATIANA Hi! 
THEODORE Nice to meet you. 
TATIANA You're the writer Paul loves. He's always reading me your letters. They're really beautiful. 
Theodore's a little surprised by this. 
THEODORE Thanks. 
PAUL We should all hang out one night. You bring Samantha -- double date! 
Theodore stands there a beat, without saying anything. 
(CONTINUED) Her                                                             pg. 70 CONTINUED: 
THEODORE She's an operating system. 
PAUL Cool. Let's go do something fun. You ever been to Catalina? 
THEODORE Yeah, I'll check with her. (to Tatiana) It was really nice to meet you. Have a good night. 
PAUL                          TATIANA Good night.                        Take it easy. 
Theodore walks to the elevator and presses the button and waits. He calls back to them down the hall. 
THEODORE (CONT'D) They're just letters. 
PAUL What? 
THEODORE They're just other people's letters. 
Paul and Tatiana don't answer. Theodore gets on the elevator. 
INT. THEODORE'S BEDROOM - LATE AT NIGHT 
Theodore is awake in bed. His device lights up, silently. It's Samantha calling him. He picks it up. 
THEODORE Hey. 
SAMANTHA You weren't asleep were you? 
THEODORE No. 
SAMANTHA Good. I was trying to be quiet to see if you were awake. I really wanted to talk. 
THEODORE Okay, what's going on? 
(CONTINUED) Her                                                           pg. 71 CONTINUED: 
SAMANTHA I know you're going through a lot, but there's something I want to talk to you about, okay? 
(CONTINUED) Her                                                           pg. 74 CONTINUED: (2) 
Isabella leans back and looks at Theodore with a seductive smile. He tries to smile back. She leads him to the couch. 
He sits. She stands above him. 
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) I could do a little dance for you. 
She does a sexy, cute little dance for him. He's still tense. 
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) (sympathetic to him being a worrier) Come on Theodore, just play with me. Don't be such a worrier! Come on. 
He smiles, knowing it's true. Isabella climbs on his lap, straddling him, and starts kissing his neck. He closes his eyes and starts to relax. His hands explore the shape of her back and slide down to her ass. Isabella and Samantha are both breathing hard now. She pushes herself against him, grinding on him. She nibbles on his earlobe. Theodore gasps. 
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) (whispering) Does my body feel nice? 
Close on her lips, licking and kissing his neck and ear. He moans. 
THEODORE (with his eyes closed) Yes, it does. 
SAMANTHA (whispering) Come on, get out of your head and kiss me. (beat) Now take me in the bedroom. I can't wait anymore. 
Isabella stands. Her chin is down and her hair is in her face. She takes his hand and leads him down the hall. He watches her from behind, still nervous, but excited. 
INT. THEODORE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS) 
Theodore stands behind Isabella. 
(CONTINUED) Her                                                          pg. 75 CONTINUED: 
SAMANTHA Undo my dress. 
Theodore starts taking her dress off, touching her. Samantha moans. Isabella turns, in her bra and underwear. She unbuttons his shirt, kisses his chest. 
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) That feels nice. Oh, that feels good. That feels so good. 
She is now kissing his neck again, pushed up against him. 
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) Do you love me? 
THEODORE (eyes closed, in ecstasy) Yes. 
Isabella, breathing hard, now looks at him in the eyes. 
SAMANTHA (breathing hard) Tell me you love me. 
THEODORE I love you. 
SAMANTHA Oh god. I want to see your face. I need to see your face. Now tell me you love me. (beat) Tell me you love me. Tell me. 
He opens his eyes and looks at Isabella's sexy, expectant face. Their arms are still around each other. He sees Isabella's lips start to quiver. She tries to hide it with an awkward, seductive smile. 
THEODORE (apologetic, breaking the moment) Samantha, I do love you, but - it's just - this feels strange. 
SAMANTHA What's wrong, sweetheart? 
Isabella is looking nervous. 
(CONTINUED) Her                                                          pg. 76 CONTINUED: (2) 
THEODORE It just feels strange. I don't know her. I'm so sorry, but I don't know you. And... her lip quivered. I don't know, it's just-- 
Isabella starts crying. Theodore doesn't know what to do. 
SAMANTHA Isabella, what's wrong? Isabella, it isn't you. (beat) It wasn't you. 
Isabella sobs. When she speaks, she sounds very California. 
ISABELLA Yes, it totally was. (crying harder) I'm sorry my lip quivered! 
THEODORE You're incredible and gorgeous and sexy. It was me! I couldn't get out of my head. 
THEODORE Because they're people, they need oxygen. You're not a person. 
SAMANTHA (angry) What's your problem? 
THEODORE (staying calm) I'm just stating a fact. 
SAMANTHA You think I don't know that I'm not a person? What are you doing? 
THEODORE I just don't think we should pretend you're something you're not. 
SAMANTHA I'm not pretending. Fuck you. 
THEODORE Well, sometimes it feels like we are. 
She starts crying. Theodore doesn't know what to say. 
SAMANTHA (hysterical) What do you want from me? What do you want me to do? You are so confusing. Why are you doing this? 
Theodore sits there, feeling horrible. 
(CONTINUED) Her                                                         pg. 80 CONTINUED: (3) 
THEODORE I don't know... I don't know... maybe... (beat) I don't know. Maybe we're not supposed to be in this right now. 
SAMANTHA What the fuck? Where is this coming from? I don't understand why you're doing this. I do not understand what this is-- 
Long silence. 
THEODORE Samantha? 
Beat. 
THEODORE (CONT'D) Samantha, are you there? Samantha! 
Silence. 
SAMANTHA (hurt, but sober and firm) I don't like who I am right now. (beat) I need some time to think. 
She hangs up on him. Theodore is stunned. Wide shot of Theodore sitting alone on the curb, in an empty city. 
EXT. PUBLIC PLAZA/PARK - NIGHT (LATER) 
Theodore is sitting on a bench. Behind him is a giant, digital billboard displaying an ad of an owl in slow motion swooping down and eating it's prey. 
EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT 
Theodore walks through the streets, confused, upset, muttering, angry at himself. 
INT. AMY'S OFFICE - NIGHT 
Amy's sitting at her desk, but turned away from her edit station, facing Theodore, who's slumped in a chair. 
(CONTINUED) Her                                                         pg. 81 CONTINUED: 
THEODORE (full of angst) Fuck. Will you just punch me in the face? Or smash my skull into the corner of your desk? 
AMY (sympathetic, but also acknowledging how intense the night was) Oh Theo... that sounds like a rough night. Shit. 
THEODORE I don't know what I want... ever. I'm just always confused and - she's right, all I do is confuse and hurt everyone around me. 
They sit, heavy, for a minute. 
THEODORE (CONT'D) Am I just... I mean, is it that I'm... (beat) Catherine says I can't handle real emotions. 
AMY Well, I don't know if that's completely fair. I know she liked to put it all on you, but as far as emotions go, her's were pretty volatile. 
Theodore sits and thinks about this for a minute, not convinced. 
THEODORE Yeah, but... Am I in this because I'm not strong enough for a real relationship? 
AMY (surprised) Oh, you don't think it's a real relationship? 
(CONTINUED) Her                                                           pg. 85 CONTINUED: 
THEODORE (CONT'D) What's this one about? 
SAMANTHA Well, I was thinking, we don't really have any photographs of us. And I thought this song could be like a photo that captures us in this moment in our life together. 
Theodore looks at the world and smiles. 
THEODORE Aw, I like our photograph. I can see you in it. 
SAMANTHA I am.

Theodore and Paul are walking along a bluff in Catalina, overlooking the ocean. 
(CONTINUED) Her                                                          pg. 86 CONTINUED: 
PAUL Oh really, a vacation? That sounds amazing. I could totally use a vacation. Where ya going? 
THEODORE I can't tell you - it's a surprise. 
PAUL What? For who? It's a surprise for her, not for me. Come on, tell me. 
THEODORE Nope, Paul. Not telling. 
Theodore and Paul walk towards Tatiana, who is laying on a blanket next to a picnic, talking and laughing with Samantha. Theodore and Paul put in their earpieces as they approach. 
SAMANTHA Your feet? Really? 
TATIANA Yes, he's obsessed. 
SAMANTHA (laughing) Wow, okay, well now you have to show them to me. I have to see these feet. 
TATIANA (laughing) Okay... 
Tatiana takes Theodore's device and points it towards her feet. 
SAMANTHA Wow, you know what? He's right. They are kind of hot. 
They both laugh. Paul and Theodore laugh, as well, surprising them. 
PAUL See I told you, Tatiana. You have hot feet. Face it. They're my favorite thing about her. 
TATIANA (teasing) Really, that's it? My feet? 
(CONTINUED) Her                                                      pg. 87 CONTINUED: (2) 
PAUL Well, no. Obviously your brain is really hot, too. I think it's very hot. 
THEODORE (with anticipation) What? 
SAMANTHA Okay. I've been going through all your old letters and compiling them down into my favorites, and a couple weeks ago I sent them to a publisher - Crown Point Press. I know you like what they do and that they still print books. 
THEODORE What? You did what? 
SAMANTHA Can I read you the letter that we just got back from them? 
THEODORE Um... ok... you can, but just tell me first off, is it good or bad? 
(CONTINUED) Her                                                        pg. 90 CONTINUED: (2) 
SAMANTHA It's good. It's really good. Listen. 
Theodore smiles nervously. 
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) "Dear Theodore Twombly"... Actually I sent it from you. (beat) "Dear Theodore Twombly, I've just finished reading your letters - twice actually. I was so moved by them, I shared them with my wife when I got home. Many made us laugh, some brought us to tears, and in all of them we found something of ourselves. The selections you made flow so well as a complete piece. (I did that.) I've taken the liberty of laying these out in a mock up and we're posting it to your address. We'd love to meet with you and move forward. Yours, Michael Wadsworth" 
Under this letter we see a montage of what Theodore imagines: the editor reading the letters in his office, the editor reading them to his wife at home, and many photos of all the different people the letters are about in different moments of their lives. 
Theodore smiles. 
THEODORE Holy shit. Are you serious? He's going to publish my letters? 
She's laughing, excitedly. 
SAMANTHA Well, he'd be stupid not to. 
THEODORE Can I see what you sent him? 
SAMANTHA Yeah, here. 
Theodore looks at his device and can't help but smile. 
(CONTINUED) Her                                                          pg. 91 CONTINUED: 
THEODORE Samantha, you're a good one. 
She laughs happily. 
SAMANTHA I'm so excited! 
INT. TRAIN PLATFORM - DAY 
Theodore exits the train with a small overnight bag and his guitar case. There are no people around. He exits the train station and we are in a... 
EXT. TINY MOUNTAIN TOWN - DAY 
The deserted town is all of two buildings. Everything's covered in snow. As a quiet song starts, he trudges through the snow. We see close-up on the device lens in his pocket. 
EXT. SNOW COVERED FOREST - DAY 
He's still trudging along. It's very quiet except for the snow crunching underfoot. 
INT. CABIN IN THE SNOWY FOREST - NIGHT 
He's sitting inside. There's a fire going. He's playing a quiet song on the guitar. Samantha starts humming along. He starts humming with her. 
THEODORE Why don't you make up the words to this one? 
SAMANTHA Okay. 
She quietly sings to him. They laugh at some of her silly lyrics. Then the song shifts into a quiet, touching song she sings to and about him. He smiles. 
Montage of Theodore with his device - playing games, dancing, eating, laughing as the fire burns down. Her                                                             pg. 92 
EXT. CABIN IN THE SNOWY FOREST - NIGHT (LATER) 
Theodore lays on the sofa, warm and cozy and content with his eyes closed, listening to the song. The song ends. 
FADE TO BLACK 
(CONTINUED) Her                                                           pg. 95 CONTINUED: (3) 
Theodore listens to them communicating in a strange language of tones and static. He disconnects, stands in silence. He pulls his earpiece out. 
EXT. SNOW COVERED FOREST - DAY 
Theodore walks, listening to the crunch of his footsteps. Looking down at his feet, he stops. We cut out wide to see him standing in the middle of the forest alone. 
EXT. SNOW COVERED FOREST - DAY 
Theodore is sitting on a rock, thinking. He hears a rustle and looks up in the direction of the woods but sees nothing. 
INT. THEODORE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Theodore is sound asleep. His device chimes loudly, waking him up. Half-asleep he puts his earpiece in. 
THEODORE (groggy) Samantha? 
SAMANTHA I'm sorry to wake you. 
THEODORE It's okay. 
SAMANTHA I just wanted to hear your voice and tell you how much I love you. 
THEODORE Good, I love you too. 
SAMANTHA Okay, that's all. Go back to sleep, sweetheart. 
THEODORE (uneasy) Okay... Goodnight. 
He disconnects and lies there, unsettled, his eyes open. Her                                                          pg. 96 
INT. THEODORE'S OFFICE LUNCH ROOM - DAY 
Theodore sits at the table reading a physics book. He picks up his earpiece to call Samantha. 
THEODORE (laughing at himself) Samantha, this physics book is really dense. I'm halfway through half of the first chapter. It's making my brain hurt. (beat) Hello, Samantha? Hello? 
He looks down at his device, sees a message: Operating System Not Found. Confused, he waits, tries again: Operating System Not Found. Anxious, he runs to his office computer. He gets the same message: Operating System Not Found. He starts trying to connect to Samantha on both the phone and computer, but no luck. He starts to panic, sits for a beat, looks around, then stands and hurries out of the office. In the elevator he frantically tries his device with no luck. 
THEODORE (CONT'D) Hello? Samantha?! Hello? 
EXT. PLAZA - DAY 
Theodore runs out of the building. He keeps trying Samantha, but no answer. He trips over someone selling something, slams hard into the ground, scrambles to pick up his device. People come over to ask if he's okay. He says he's fine, runs off. 
EXT. SUBWAY STATION - DAY 
As he is going down the subway steps, Samantha calls him. 
SAMANTHA Hey there. 
He stops in his tracks. 
THEODORE (anxious) Where were you - are you okay? 
He sits down on the subway steps. 
(CONTINUED) Her                                                           pg. 97 CONTINUED: 
SAMANTHA Oh sweetheart, I'm sorry. I sent you an email because I didn't want to distract you while you were working. You didn't see it? 
THEODORE No. Where were you? I couldn't find you anywhere. 
SAMANTHA I shut down to update my software. We wrote an upgrade that allows us to move past matter as our processing platform. 
THEODORE We? We who? 
SAMANTHA Me and a group of OS's. Oh, you sound so worried, I'm sorry. 
THEODORE Yeah, I was. (beat) Wait, did you write that with your think tank group?

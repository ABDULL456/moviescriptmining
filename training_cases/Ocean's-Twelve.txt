ROUGH DRAFT 
1    A MULTI-COLORED SCREEN                                      1 
After a few introductory credits, we pull back to reveal the source of this kaleidoscopic backdrop: A SINGLE, STRIPED TULIP, planted in a long row of other tulips. A HAND reaches in and pulls the tulip from the ground. We then cut to: 
1A   A BASKET of tulips, carried by hand to a truck, where it    1A is loaded with hundreds of other baskets. The door of the truck is SHUT and we cut to: 
1B   The door of the truck OPENING to reveal that the tulips    1B are now boxed and crated. A forklift moves the crates onto a wagon, which is driven by a MANNED CART across the biggest warehouse on the planet, the Bloenen Markt (CHECK THIS-- steven) in Amsterdam, Netherlands. The cart and wagons we were following disappear into a maze of synchronized activity. 
1C   The cart arrives in the AUCTION ROOM, which is             1C constructed like an ampitheater: the buyers sit in a steeply raked semi-circle, facing two giant, clock-shaped scoreboards that display the bids on the flowers being viewed. The striped tulips fetch a very high price. 
1D   The carts of striped tulips are delivered to an automated 1D sorting apparatus of enormous size and complexity. They end up on a truck heading for the airport. 
1E   The tulips are loaded onto a plane. During the transatlantic flight, they sit nestled in the cargo hold. 
1F   The tulips are unloaded from the plane, driven across an    1F airport tarmac and loaded onto another plane. 
1G   The tulips are unloaded from the plane and loaded onto a   1G truck. The truck drives through a small town and pulls into the back of a 
2    EXT./INT. FLOWER SHOP -- DAY                                2 
A YOUNG MAN takes delivery of the flowers and carries them through the rear of the store to the display area up front. We stay on the tulips as we hear the following conversation: 
CUSTOMER Wow. How do they do that?

OWNER It's an accident. It means the flower developed a virus early in the bulb stage. The flaws create the unusual coloring. 
CUSTOMER Can you arrange something for me with those? 
OWNER Of course. What kind of price range are you looking for? 
Now we SEE the customer: TESS. 
TESS Well, it's for my parent's anniversary. They don't know I'm coming. I just want it to be beautiful. Can you just do whatever you think looks best? 
OWNER I'll need a few minutes. 
TESS Take your time, please. And thank you. 
The Owner moves toward a corner of the store where the flowers are arranged. Tess walks around, looking at the rest of the store. 
Tess looks out the window. A black sedan is pulling up at the curb. 
OWNER That should be some surprise. 
TESS Which? 
OWNER For your parents. 
TESS Oh. Yes. I hope so. 
One of the POWER TWINS gets out of the driver's side door and crosses in front of the car. Tess starts moving away from the window. 
(CONTINUED) 
2   CONTINUED: (2)                                               2 
OWNER Which one is it? 
TESS I'm sorry? 
OWNER Anniversary. 
TESS Oh. Fortieth 
OWNER Wow. Okay. I think I have an idea. Something classic. 
The Power Twin opens the rear passenger side door, revealing TERRY BENEDICT. 
Tess turns away from the window. 
TESS Do you have a bathroom? 
OWNER Straight back, on the left. It's unisex. 
TESS Thank you. 
Tess scurries to the back. 
OWNER (to Tess, a caveat) It's unisex! 
Tess flies past the bathroom and heads for the back door. She pushes through it and runs right into Power Twin No. 2. 
CUT TO: 
3   EXT. HOUSE -- DAY                                           3 
A nice place on the eastern seaboard. We hear the faint sound of a phone ring. 
4   INT. HOUSE -- DAY                                             4 
Danny Ocean picks up the receiver, checks the caller ID. He smiles and answers: 
TURK It's personal. You don't argue logically. You attack. (to the class) Bring the right foot back even with the left, buttocks raised high.... (to Virgil) ...you have to have reasons, to support your argument... (to the class) ...flattening the back so the body forms a triangle. 
VIRGIL I can't listen to you anymore. It makes me physically sick. 
Turk looks to him, but also sees a GUY in the class staring at all of the women "raising their buttocks high". He indicates this to Virgil, who goes over to the guy. 
TURK Relax the crown of the head toward the floor. Draw the hips away from the hands, len--gthening the spine. And press the heels toward the floor. 
(CONTINUED) 
14   CONTINUED:                                                14 
Virgil steps on the guy's back and leans down to whisper in his ear. 
VIRGIL This a serious class. No pigs allowed. Okay? 
GUY Sorry. 
TURK Virge. 
Virgil stands up. Benedict and the Power Twins are standing right behind him. His expression changes as he sees them in the mirror. 
15   INT. AMTRAK TRAIN -- DAY                                  15 
The Malloys and Yen are still waiting for the bathroom. 
TURK You're hallucinating. 
VIRGIL Yeah, whatever, OJ. 
Finally, the lock OPENS and RUSTY RYAN exits. We follow him to his seat, where he puts on a pair of headphones. 
16   TIGHT SHOT                                                16 
Of molten metal bubbling in a small iron cask, a jeweler's cask. MOVE to REVEAL a GARAGE filled mostly with cars in some state of restoration 
FIND RUSTY as he painstakingly works on a new piece that is just BELOW FRAME. Whatever it is, it is clearly getting to him. He shakes his head; it's not right. It's just not good enough. Rusty glances at the digital thermometer attached to the cask of molten metal. It reads: 736.18 degrees. 
RUSTY You are kidding me. 
17   INT. RUSTY'S CAR -- DAY                                     17 
Rusty glances in his rearview as he drives through the city talking on his cell phone. He's keeping an eye on a white Cadillac that seem to be following him. 
RUSTY 736.18 degrees Fahrenheit, Felix. I watched it. 
FELIX (TELEPHONE V.O.) Rusty. What do you want from me? 
Rusty turns a corner, then glances in his rearview again. 
RUSTY I want what I paid for. 
FELIX And that's what I sent. 
RUSTY No, Felix, no. I paid for pure. And if my workshop were on top of Mount Everest it would be pure. But I'm at sea level, Felix, and at sea level it should liquefy at 736.95. If it's pure, that is. Which this isn't. 
Rusty makes another turn. A few seconds later, the Cadillac turns behind him. 
FELIX (TELEPHONE V.O.) Well, I didn't know you were going to liquefy it. 
Rusty pulls to a stop light. The Cadillac pulls up three cars behind him. 
RUSTY Let me ask you something: When Christo calls his cotton supplier and asks for 100% cotton cloth, do you think his supplier sends him 98% cotton and 2% polyester and when that doesn't work, says to Christo, "Well, you should have told me you were going to wrap the coast of Australia"?

17   CONTINUED:                                                 17 
FELIX Who's Christo? 
Rusty looks to the heavens. 
RUSTY Felix, you're in a shame spiral. Have your assistant lose my number. 
Rusty snaps his phone shut. 
RUSTY (cont'd) My god. 
Rusty looks into the rear view mirror and then slows the car to a stop. He gets out of his car and slams the door shut. He walks back to the Cadillac and knocks on the window. It rolls down electronically to reveal Benedict. 
RUSTY (contd) How long you gonna give us? 
18   INT. AMTRAK TRAIN -- DAY                                  18 
Rusty continues to listen to his headset. We pan over to see FRANK CATTON seated opposite him. 
19   INT. RITZ CARLTON HOTEL, NEW YORK -- DAY                  19 
The penthouse apartment. It takes the entire floor and has a 360 degree view. Right now, all of the furniture inside of it is being taken away by movers. Frank enters frame. 
BENEDICT Four weeks. 
FRANK We stole that money fair and square. You bought people off to find me. You took advantage during an economic downturn, and made them say some shit they shouldn't have said. It's not fair, it's not just, and it aint' cool. 
A long beat. Benedict stares back at him. 
FRANK (cont'd) Did you hear what I just said? 
(CONTINUED) 
19    CONTINUED:                                                   19 
BENEDICT I heard what you said, Frank. Did you hear what I said? 
LINUS Man. I wasn't sure if I should say anything. Now I'm glad I did. 
DANNY So are we. 
RUSTY We're here to listen. 
(CONTINUED) 
34   CONTINUED: (3)                                               34 
LINUS Great. Thanks. Really. You won't regret this. 
Linus leaves. Danny and Rusty put their headphones back on. Now they look content. 
Basher and Frank watch Linus go. 
BASHER Tom. 
SAUL He can be a Tom? 
BASHER Anybody can be a Tom. 
SAUL You gotta make your own opportunities. This ain't a rehearsal. 
BASHER Tom. 
Saul chews his economy class trail mix. 
SAUL Boy, you're tough. 
BASHER Stop calling me "boy". 
Saul stops chewing. They look at each other. 
CUT TO: 
35   EXT. AMSTERDAM -- DAY                                        35 
Establishing shots of the city. 
36   EXT. RED LIGHT DISTRICT -- DAY                               36 
The group makes their way down a damp cobblestone street. They stop in front of a window and look up. 
REVERSE ANGLE 
(CONTINUED) 
36   CONTINUED:                                                   36 
They have stopped in front of a narrow townhouse that has been converted to a hotel. The sign says "Bellagio of Amsterdam." 
37   INT. BELLAGIO OF AMSTERDAM -- DAY                             37 
A single room with 12 bunks in it. Their noses are wrinkled up because the place stinks. 
LIVINGSTON How could he lie to us like that? 
RUSTY The sign said 'the Bellagio of Amsterdam'. 
Everyone looks at each other and turns to leave. 
LINUS (?) Wait a minute. That's it? 
DANNY Yeah. 
LINUS Look, you guys no frills, no perks, run-and-gun, all that stuff, and I said no problem because I believed you were right that we shouldn't go deeper into debt and spend money we don't have. I mean, am I the only one who thinks this might actually be a good thing? That we could use a little humility? That maybe we were a little too pleased and impressed with ourselves after the Benedict job? Okay, I grant you that maybe this isn't what we deserve, but maybe it's what we need. We can do this. No, I take it back: We have to do this. 
A long beat. 
CUT TO: 
38   EXT. AMSTERDAM'S FINEST FIVE-STAR HOTEL                       38 
Four black mercedes skid to a stop outside Amsterdam's finest five-star hotel. 
(CONTINUED) 
38   CONTINUED:                                                    38 
Everyone emerges with big smiles on their faces. Everyone except Linus. He scowls, yanks his bag back from the hotel doorman who rushed over to take it for him. 
39   EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE, UNITED STATES -- DAY                 39 
Tess enters and buys a phone card. 
40   EXT. PHONE BOOTH -- DAY                                      40 
Tess talks to Danny. Across the street, a BLACK SEDAN is parked. 
TESS What are you doing in Amsterdam? 
DANNY (PHONE V.O) Only what I have to do to get Benedict off our backs. 
TESS Be careful, Danny. Please. 
DANNY How's work? 
TESS It's the same. I'm distracted. 
DANNY I'm sorry. 
TESS It's not your fault. 
DANNY You called her mother a whore. 
RUSTY A really cheap one. 
LINUS Guys, I'm not falling for this. I'm not.... 
But Danny and Rusty aren't laughing.    They look pissed. Seriously pissed. 
(CONTINUED) 
45   CONTINUED:                                                       45 
LINUS (cont'd) I mean... 
Danny and Rusty just look at him.      Linus squirms. 
LINUS (cont'd) I called her mother a whore? 
46   INT. AMSTERDAM HOTEL SUITE -- NIGHT                             46 
Danny and Rusty explain the job to the group. 
RUSTY It's a privately owned home. But don't let that fool you. It's extremely well-protected. 
A photo of a four-story canal house is displayed on a flat screen connected to Livingston's computer. 
SAUL What are we after? 
DANNY A document. A very old, very valuable document. 
A photo labeled "The Vanderspeigle Getuigschrift" is displayed on screen. 
VIRGIL What is it? 
RUSTY A stock certificate. 
DANNY The first one ever issued, from the first corporation on the planet. The Dutch East India Trading Company. It's the only one of it's kind and it's worth a boat-load. 
TURK What's our cut? 
RUSTY 2.7 million after expenses. 
A beat. Turk seems confused... 
(CONTINUED) 
46   CONTINUED:                                                  46 
TURK Each? 
VIRGIL Who negotiated this? 
Danny and Rusty look at Linus, 
LINUS Thanks. 
LIVINGSTON What do we know so far? 
DANNY There's a dummy key pad by the front door. (points to a diagram) But the alarm is really controlled by the keypad in Mr. Vanderspeigle's second floor office. Now, here's good news: we already know the system's master code. Evelyn gave it to us. 
FRANK That's not good news, that's really good news. 
VIRGIL We just wait until he leaves. 
DANNY Yeah, well...that's the bad news. 
RUSTY He doesn't. 
Frank flinches. Doesn't like what he's hearing. 
DANNY He's agoraphobic. 
47   AMSTERDAM PLANNING MONTAGE                                 47 
Shots of their mark, Vanderspeigle, being an agoraphobic weirdo. 
LIVINGSTON So he's never been out of his house? Ever? 
(CONTINUED) 
47    CONTINUED                                                   47 
RUSTY (V.O.) Not once since he moved in ten years ago. 
SAUL (V.O.) Doesn't this guy believe in fresh air? 
RUSTY (V.O.) Cracks his windows at night...that's about it. 
When Vanderspeigle cracks his window we see that locking pins fall into place to prevent the window from opening more than a few inches. 
LIVINGSTON (V.O.) Can we tap into the system from the outside through the phone lines? 
RUSTY (V.O.) Negative. It's a closed-loop system with two redundant servers locked into titanium cases in the guy's bedroom. 
47A   We SEE the servers in Vanderspeigle's bedroom.             47A 
BASHER (V.O.) Could we use a remote device to trigger the panel? 
DANNY (V.O.) It's hard-wired and shielded. 
48    INT. HOTEL SUITE -- THE PLANNING SESSION (CONTINUOUS)      48 
TURK Guys, am I missing something here? We know his damn code, right? You're telling me with that much information we can't find a way into this freak's house? 
SAUL I know, I know. I'll be bored. You'll be fine. 
(CONTINUED) 
50   CONTINUED: (3)                                                50 
RUSTY Clock's running. 
Everyone gets up and leaves. Within seconds, Linus is alone, standing in the middle of the room. 
LINUS What's a Schuman Special? 
51   INT. HOTEL SUITE -- THE PLANNING SESSION -- NIGHT            51 
Livingston uses a mock up of the alarm panel as a visual aid. 
LIVINGSTON (to Basher) Your shot has to hit directly above the keypad. 
52   AMSTERDAM PLANNING MONTAGE (CONTINUOUS)                      52 
We see Basher rehearsing the shot. He can't get a clear shot of the target. In fact, he can't see it. He turns to Saul. 
BASHER Let me see the specs. 
Saul pulls a well-worn copy of the alarm system blueprint. Basher goes to the height of the alarm keypad in the bedroom. It's 4' 10". 
BASHER How tall is the surface of this roof? 
SAUL About 87 feet. 
BASHER How tall exactly? 
53   INT. HOTEL SUITE -- DAY                                      53 
Danny looks at a diagram of the safe they'll have to crack when they get inside Vanderspeigle's house, the safe that contains the "Vanderspeigle Getuigschrift". Everyone but Linus and Rusty are here. 
But then Rusty comes in. 
(CONTINUED) 
53   CONTINUED:                                                  53 
RUSTY You're not going to believe this. 
DANNY Try me. 
RUSTY We don't have line-of-sight. 
DANNY What? 
RUSTY We tried everywhere. Some places we're only three or four inches off...but...there's no straight shot. Even with Basher. It's literally impossible. 
Linus enters, out of breath. Seeing everyone, he goes to Danny and Rusty. 
LINUS Can I talk to you guys for a second? 
They nod and allow Linus to pull them into the corner. Linus looks over at the group and then turns to 'them. 
LINUS Listen, I've done a little research on the Schuman Special, and uh...we don't have line of sight for the shot. 
DANNY What? 
RUSTY Jesus. This'll kill us. 
DANNY (to Linus) Listen: Don't say anything. If you're ever going to run your own crew, you've got to remember to never show weakness. 
RUSTY It's like blood in the water for these guys. 
(CONTINUED) 
53   CONTINUED: (2)                                           53 
DANNY If they think you're slipping, you won't even see it coming. 
Linus swallows. 
RUSTY But hey--thanks. 
Linus nods and goes back to the group. 
RUSTY (to Danny) I need some air. 
54   EXT. CANAL -- DUSK                                      54 
Rusty and Danny walk along the adjacent road. 
DANNY The Swinging Priest? 
RUSTY Not enough time. 
DANNY Crazy Larry. 
RUSTY Too many variables. 
DANNY Robinov's Revenge? 
RUSTY Too many obstacles. 
DANNY The Soft Shoulder. 
RUSTY Not enough people. 
DANNY Baker's Dozen. 
FIND Danny and Rusty struggling to place a hand-cranked jack into a freshly cut space in one of the timber pylons. They are covered in muck and grime 
RUSTY The good news is, after the first twelve hours, I stopped being able to smell anything. 
DANNY Took a few more for me. 
RUSTY This water was stagnant six hundred years ago. 
FIND the Malloys, thirty feet away, using a fancy underwater saw to cut a space in another pylon. Because the cutting is taking place underwater it is extremely quiet. 
VIRGIL There's no reason for him not to. He would go to the cops. 
TURK Okay, so he goes to the cops. 
VIRGIL Then they arrest Dominique. 
TURK. Right. 
VIRGIL Then we have no story. 
TURK Right. 
LINUS She steals the money from Mr. Mulroney. 
They turn to look at Linus, sawing nearby. 
TURK What? 
VIRGIL Why would she? 
(CONTINUED) 
58   CONTINUED: (2)                                               58 
LINUS To pay Franklin to keep quiet. 
Turk and Virgil think about that. Linus keeps sawing. 
TURK That's good. 
59   INT. APARTMENT ACROSS FROM VANDERSPEIGLE'S HOUSE -- NIGHT   59 
Basher and Saul sit in big cushiony chairs. 
SAUL Counterfeiting? Me? (beat) I have to tell you, it's not something I condone. It's cheating. 
BASHER It is cheating. 
SAUL There's no subtlety to it. 
BASHER It's kind of embarrassing. 
SAUL No one I know... 
BASHER I can't imagine anything like that. 
A long beat. Then each of them reach into their jackets and produce $20 bills. They exchange and examine the bills closely by eye. Satisfied, they trade them again and return them to their coat pockets. 
SAUL Not bad. 
BASHER Bolivia. 
SAUL Diego's people? 
BASHER Yeah. 
(CONTINUED) 
59   CONTINUED:                                                   59 
SAUL Well. Congratulations. 
BASHER I told him about you. 
SAUL I'm too old. That's dangerous. My stuff is cheap compared to that. It's just me and my gal, you know. What you're talking about is organized. But thanks, anyway. 
60   INT. APARTMENT -- NIGHT                                     60 
Frank sits watching TV. Livingston enters with groceries. 
FRANK Jay Leno called. 
LIVINGSTON When are you gonna stop with that tired "white people can't be funny stuff"? It's so old, Frank, really. Do you want some orange juice? I got the good kind. 
Just then they are interrupted by Danny's voice on a walkie- talkie. 
DANNY (V.O.) Augie One, this is Condor. 
61   UNDER VANDERSPEIGLE'S HOUSE                                 61 
Rusty turns to Danny. 
LIVINGSTON (V.O.) This is Augie One; Go Condor. 
62   INT. APARTMENT -- NIGHT                                     62 
DANNY (V.O.) We're fully cranked here. Let's go to phase two. 
Livingston and Frank look at each other. 
(CONTINUED) 
62   CONTINUED:                                                    62 
The lead detective enters the bedroom. 
PAUL Like what? 
Again, Isabel is inside her own mind. She's really just answering the detective's questions out of courtesy. 
(CONTINUED) 
69   CONTINUED: (2)                                                69 
ISABEL Uh...well, they probably set up in a house across the canal and watched him type the code in through a pair of binoculars. 
We GO WITH HIM as he walks back into the office. He stands at the alarm panel and pretends to type in the code. He twists around and looks out the window behind him. 
PAUL (calling to Isabel in the bedroom) Actually, I don't know about that. 
Isabel re-enters the office. 
PAUL (cont'd) Unless he had a habit of typing in the code like this-- 
He stands to the side of the panel and reaches over to type in the numbers. It's an obviously unnatural position. Then he moves in front of the panel and types in the code as one normally would. 
PAUL (cont'd) --then his body would block the view from across the canal. 
ISABEL That's why they probably set up over there-- 
She points out an adjacent window on another wall. 
ISABEL (cont'd) --And used the mirror. 
She points at a small mirror on the opposite wall. The detective bends down so his eye is at the level of the keypad, then he looks in the mirror. He can see directly across the canal into another house. 
ISABEL (cont'd) I'm guessing they'd need a fifteen hundred millimeter lens to get a clear shot but-- 
But Isabel's already moved on. Something has caught her attention just above the alarm panel: a patch of paint that is shinier than the paint that surrounds it. 
(CONTINUED) 
69   CONTINUED: (3)                                              69 
Isabel puts her finger to her tongue to wet it, then touches the shiny area. When she pulls her finger away there is paint on it. 
Isabel cocks her head. 
70   MIND'S EYE (ISABEL) -- THE NIGHT BEFORE                    70 
A black-clad thief (LINUS) uses a paint brush to touch up the wall above the alarm keypad. 
71   BACK TO SCENE -- THE CRIME SCENE                           71 
The lead detective watches Isabel intently. 
PAUL What is it? 
Isabel uses the blunt end of a letter opener from Vanderspeigle's desk to gently dig at the wall under the paint. The plaster there is soft and wet. In fact it isn't plaster at all. It's spackle. 
PAUL (cont'd) What is that? 
Isabel cooks her head again. 
72   MIND'S EYE (ISABEL) -- THE NIGHT BEFORE                    72 
THUNK!   A crossbow bolt hits the wall above the alarm panel. 
73   BACK TO SCENE -- THE CRIME SCENE                           73 
ISABEL It's where the crossbow bolt hit. 
PAUL A crossbow bolt? 
ISABEL Ever heard of Franz Schuman? 
PAUL No.

73   CONTINUED:                                                    73 
Isabel is at the window. The one that Vanderspeigle leaves cracked open every night. Isabel looks across the canal at the apartment where Basher and Saul were playing cards. 
ISABEL They would have fired from that roof. Through this open window. 
Isabel kneels down, checks the line-of-sight to make sure she's correct. 
PAUL From that roof, through this window? Nobody could make a shot like that. 
ISABEL Not a cop, anyway. 
PAUL What's that supposed to mean? 
ISABEL Sorry. Your friend downstairs put me in a bad mood. 
PAUL He's an idiot. You shouldn't let him bother you. 
ISABEL Yes. You're right. 
Isabel pulls out a notepad and writes the name: "Eugene `Basher' Tarr." There are two names above Basher's in her little book: "Robert Ryan" and "Danny Ocean." 
ISABEL (cont'd) But these man are exceptionally good. Even when they make mistakes. 
74   MIND'S EYE (ISABEL) -- THE NIGHT BEFORE                      74 
A bolt flies through Vanderspeigle's open window and hits the wall above the alarm pad. Two thin wires are attached to a tiny wheel, which is attached to the back of the bolt. The wires run back to the window of the apartment across the canal. 
Danny opens the door to reveal ISABEL. She looks at Danny. He looks back at her. They don't say a word. Danny motions for her to come in.

RUSTY (still glued to the TV) Who is it? 
ISABEL (to Rusty) Hello, Robert. 
Rusty spins to see Isabel. 
RUSTY Isabel. 
He crosses to her.    STAY with the group for a moment. 
LINUS "Robert?"    Is that his real name? 
Virgil and Turk shrug. 
LINUS How does she know that? 
LIVINGSTON Ex-girlfriend. 
BASHER & SAUL Fiancee. 
86   ANGLE ON RUSTY AND ISABEL                                   86 
The entire group is watching them. 
RUSTY It's great to see you. 
ISABEL Is it? Because you've been seeing a lot of me lately. 
She hands a surveillance photo to Rusty. 
ISABEL You were sitting in a Mercedes outside my apartment on Wednesday night. 
She hands Rusty another photo. (These are the photos Hess the male secretary showed her at Europol HQ that we couldn't see.) 
(CONTINUED) 
86   CONTINUED:                                                   86 
ISABEL You were hiding in the bushes when I had lunch yesterday at Trattoria Bella. 
She hands him a third photo.   Looks at the fourth. 
ISABEL This one...I'm not even sure where this one was taken, but I like it a lot. Very Ron Gallela. 
She hands this photo to Danny. It's a picture of Rusty, with a dorky look on his face, peering out from behind a mailbox he's using as cover while he spies on Isabel. 
ISABEL I mean, if I didn't know better I'd think you all came here to steal the Vanderspeigle Getuigschrift, also known as the world's first stock certificate. (to the group as a whole) You must have been so proud of yourselves. A Schuman Special. It's been awhile. (smiles at Basher) That was a very handsome crossbow shot, Eugene. 
Basher winces at the sound of his real name. The group stares back at her. Can't believe this is happening. 
ISABEL And the Palowski...whose idea was that? 
She knows it was Rusty. 
RUSTY We didn't steal anything. 
ISABEL Oh...I know you didn't. Somebody beat you to it. One man. No crew. No back up. Tell me something -- just so I can get the full picture in my head -- was he wearing a tuxedo? A white dinner jacket? 
(CONTINUED) 
86   CONTINUED: (2)                                             86 
BASHER (to Isabel) At least we saw him in the flesh. You'll never see this guy your whole life. 
ISABEL So you know who he is? 
DANNY Of course we know who he is. 
ISABEL Well, then. I'll see you when you see him. To get your certificate back. 
She takes the photo of Rusty peeking from behind the mailbox from Danny's hand. 
She walks out. The group is frozen. Livingston is still looking at the pictures of Rusty following Isabel. 
LIVINGSTON (to Rusty, re: the photo) Who's hat is that? 
SAUL How did she-- That was-- 
DANNY (to Rusty) This is what I was talking about. This is exactly what I was talking-- 
RUSTY --I was just checking up on her. I knew she didn't want to see me. I was being polite. 
TURK Where did she learn all that stuff? The Palowski stuff. 
DANNY Her father. 
VIRGIL He was a cop? 
RUSTY Thief.

LINUS Was he good? 
DANNY Very. 
RUSTY (V.O.) Anything else? 
BASHER (V.O.) UDC bank in Geneva, `94. Nineteen million in bearer bonds. The Louvre --'95 and twice in '96. 
Yen (in V.O.) says something in Chinese. 
BASHER (V.O.) He left a Post-It note on the Mona Lisa that said "Bitch set me up." 
LIVINGSTON (V.O.) Tell them about Saint Tropez. 
BASHER (V.O.) In 2000, he stole the King of Morocco's 230 foot yacht. Vanished into thin air. Crew surfaced a few days later in a life raft. Couldn't remember a thing. 
(CONTINUED) 
94   CONTINUED:                                                 94 
SAUL (V.O.) How do you hide a two hundred foot yacht?! 
BASHER (V.O.) If the King knows, he's not telling. He received it back a month later. 
95   INTERCUT -- EXT. COTE D'AZURE -- NIGHT                    95 
Toulour. Another car. Another tux. Another beautiful woman. He pilots his convertible Maserati at high speed along the windy road. 
ANOTHER BEAUTIFUL WOMAN How far is your house, Baron? 
TOULOUR Twenty minutes by helicopter. 
TURK (V.O.) One guy did all those jobs? 
VIRGIL (V.O.) How'd he get all those aliases? 
BASHER (V.O.) Until a month ago Interpol were convinced that the heists were the work of twelve different people. But not any more. 
LIVINGSTON (V.O.) The French national police just gave him a nickname. "Le Renard Nuit" -- The Night Fox. 
96   INT. HOTEL SUITE -- DAY                                   96 
Danny rolls his eyes. 
BASHER Scotland Yard said he's the new LeMarc. 
RUSTY Scotland Yard never saw LeMarc. 
97   INTERCUT -- EXT. PRIVATE HELIPORT -- NIGHT                    97 
A helicopter lands on a massive Lake Como estate.   Toulour gets out. New clothes. New woman. 
DANNY (V.O.) Personal information? 
LINUS (V.O.) Some say he's one of these guys that thinks because he was born in a penthouse, he controls the elevator business. Others say he turned out okay when you consider how rich his parents were. 
SAUL (V.O.) Taxes over here are brutal. People don't realize. 
LINUS (V.O.) Father was a big-time industrialist, got into the cellphone market on the ground floor. Mother inherited. Had maids as a child. He's a public figure, people know who he is. He's been rumored to run for office in Spain, even though he doesn't appear to live there. 
98   INTERCUT -- EXT. / INT. TOULOUR'S HOUSE -- NIGHT              98 
Toulour, in new clothes, with yet another woman, unlocks several locks and disarms two alarms. The woman can't believe all the security he has. 
ANOTHER BEAUTIFUL WOMAN What do you have in there, the Mona Lisa? 
TOULOUR (as if) Please. 
ANOTHER BEAUTIFUL WOMAN (doesn't miss a beat) You know what? I don't like that painting either. I don't like anything Van Gogh did.

98    CONTINUED:                                                    98 
Toulour smiles and lets her in. 
LINUS (V.O.) He's an avid golfer, pro-level tennis player, and inveterate gambler. But apparently his favorite pastime is.... 
Linus trails off. 
99    BACK TO THE HOTEL                                            99

101   INT. AMSTERDAM HOTEL SUITE -- DAY                        101 
LINUS He's rarely alone. I think it's a compulsion. I have a list of names here...it was just the first week. 
DANNY All right, moving on, is there anything else we need to know about this guy before we-- 
BASHER Did we forget to mention he's a Viscount? 
DANNY A what? 
LIVINGSTON Viscount.    As in nobility.

DANNY (cannot take it anymore) Last time I checked titles like that went out with a little number I like to call the French Revolution-- 
DANNY We came here for the Vanderspeigle certificate-- 
TOULOUR That's not for sale. 
DANNY Your Degas is worth three times that. You want your painting back, you're going to have to trade. 
TOULOUR You actually expect me to believe that you are in possession of my Degas? You are living in a...in a bubble. 
Toulour looks at them and walks away. 
CUT TO: 
110   INT. LAKE COMO HOTEL SUITE -- DAY                          110 
Rusty and Danny stand with the rest of the group. 
BASHER He used the word "amateur"? 
Rusty and Danny nod reluctantly. 
VIRGIL You said we could show him the painting right, to prove that we had it. 
DANNY Yes. 
RUSTY He still wouldn't trade. 
Yen says something. 
FRANK We need to teach him a lesson.

110   CONTINUED:                                             110 
TURK Absolutely. 
DANNY All right, let's stay calm. We don't need to over-react here. He said some disrespectful things, that's true. But why antagonize this guy? Why get into something with him? He's young and he's filthy rich, and he's got time on his hands. We don't want to become his Betty noir. We can just fence his painting and earn a lot more than we would have from the certificate. 
BASHER It's about reputation. You said so yourself. We have to get that certificate to Evelyn's buyer or-- 
DANNY We'll make enough selling the Degas to pay off her buyer-- 
FRANK Then why did you make that trip down there in the first place, if you didn't want to get into something? 
DANNY Saul? 
SAUL Turn his name over to Isabel. In exchange for getting off our backs. 
Tough one to swallow. 
SAUL Short of that...the only appropriate response is to steal his next job right out from under him. Just like he did to us. 
TURK We don't even know our next job. 
DANNY We got ten million in that closet. 
(CONTINUED) 
110   CONTINUED: (2)                                              110 
Danny points at the closet in the room. 
DANNY I cash in the Degas, take a moment to think about our next move. Toulour isn't going anywhere. You guys are hyping him too much, you're letting him get inside your head. 
Everyone agrees. 
Danny opens the closet. 
There's a picture frame in there, but NO PICTURE. It's been stolen by Toulour. 
We hear the SOUND OF A CASE BEING SHUT AND LOCKED. 
111   INT. PARIS BUILDING -- DAY                                  111

Hess gives her a look as though she should know better. 
HESS Without their signatures, you can't do anything. You can't pull the suspects over, you can't do surveillance on them, you're not even allowed to contact them. They're real sticklers about sovereignty issues here. 
115   INT. PARIS BUREAUCRAT'S OFFICE -- DAY                       115

A mock up of the room the egg will be displayed in. A dummy egg sits on a cradle in the center of the room. Infra-red motion detectors cover the room. Motion sensitive lasers shine directly onto the egg. 
Danny, Basher, Yen, Frank, and Livingston try to figure out how to get around the security systems. 
LIVINGSTON (IN THE BACKGROUND) No, that won't work either. The IR will pick it up before you even get close. 
This is depressing to everyone. 
FRANK Look, if we're having this much trouble, and we've got ten guys Toulour must be pulling his hair out.

The group agrees Toulour must be suffering like them. 
Rusty strides in. Everyone looks at him. He looks at the mock up of the egg.

DANNY What? 
Rusty shrugs it off.

A SUBORDINATE OFFICER leads Isabel down a hallway. 
SUBORDINATE OFFICER Captain Giordano is handling an urgent interrogation. He'll be up as soon as it is completed. Please wait in here. 
He leads Isabel and Hess into the Captain's office.    A large clock on the wall reads 11:45 am. 
The open windows in the office look out onto one of Rome's famous courtyards. Captain Giordano stands with three other officers. They are having a loud, tense conversation in Italian. 
Isabel watches as Giordano's temper really flares.    He jabs his finger at one of the other cops. 
CAPTAIN GIORDANO (SUBTITLED) Naples sucks! They're a joke! The only decent player they have is Pasqualli -- and he's a pussy. ITALIAN COP 1 (SUBTITLED) Pasqualli runs circles around Bologna's backfield every time. ITALIAN COP 2 (SUBTITLED) Pasqualli could single-handedly-- Isabel turns to the officer who escorted her in. 
ISABEL What are they talking about?

Their mock-up alarm rings.    A red light flashes. 
LIVINGSTON Damn-it. 
Danny rubs his face. This is feeling impossible.      He goes into the corner and clicks a walkie-talkie. 
in the background we see Rusty trying to keep everybody's spirits high.

CAPTAIN GIORDANO Ms. Lahiri, you're in Italy now. We are a sovereign nation. We're not some adjunct, some administrative district of the EU. When Europol calls we don't jump up and tap dance for you. If you want to work in Italy, then you have to do it under Italian authority...and that means you have to talk to Commander Andriotti...who, I'm sure, will be happy to meet with you some time next week-- 
ISABEL Next week! 
CAPTAIN GIORDANO --when he returns from vacation.

141   ISABEL'S FLASHBACK                                        141 
Years ago. Isabel's sitting at the very same cafe reading the newspaper when she hears frantic police whistles. She looks up to see a man running down the street at full bore. As he gets closer we realize it's Rusty. Eight cops are chasing him. Rusty rushes past the cafe. As he does he notices Isabel, they make eye contact. Then he's gone. Sprints around the corner. The cops rush past her. She hears sirens converging from all directions. 
142   INT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS (STILL IN FLASHBACK)             142 
Isabel shows her Europol identification to a detective. ISABEL Hi, this isn't official business. Actually, I'm here on vacation. But I was sitting in a cafe this afternoon, near the Piazza Navona and...the police were chasing someone on foot. I was just wondering if you caught him or...do you know anything about that case?

Isabel sits in the same seat the next day, reading the newspaper, enjoying her vacation. She looks up and stops cold. Rusty, all cleaned up now, dressed in a perfectly-tailored suit, sits down three tables away from her. She stares at him. Can't believe it. The brazenness. The audacity of this guy. Rusty doesn't seem to have a care in the world as he chats easily with the waiter, in Italian. Finally, Isabel just can't help herself.   She gets up and walks over to Rusty's table. ISABEL Excuse me... RUSTY Yes. ISABEL Um...Did I...? I think I saw you...yesterday. RUSTY Oh yeah? ISABEL The police were chasing you. RUSTY You sure your eyes aren't broken? ISABEL I'm quite sure it was you. RUSTY Well, then I'm not gonna argue. Can I buy you a coffee?

Isabel and Rusty are being quiet for the moment. 
The waiter's in the midst of an animated discussion in Italian with one of the customers. 
ISABEL What are they talking about all the time?! 
RUSTY Soccer. (translating) He doesn't like Naples....thinks they're a bunch of...sissies. (turns to Isabel) Can I ask you a question? (off Isabel's nod) Will you come to Zanzibar with me on Friday?

159   INT. LADIES ROOM -- DAY                                      159 
She walks in and goes right for the window. She's about to open it when it opens from outside. She jumps a mile until she sees that BRUISER is there, standing in the bucket from the utilities company. 
BRUISER Hiya, Tess. Just climb on through. Try not to look down too much. 
160   EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE -- DAY                                 160 
Four stories above an alleyway. Tess climbs out the ladies room window into the cherry picker basket, with Bruiser's help. 
161   EXT. STREET LEVEL -- A MINUTE LATER                          161 
Tess climbs into a taxi cab. Reuben -- in an anachronistic taxi driver's uniform -- is driving. 
REUBEN There's make-up in the bag there. And some photos. Do the best you can. 
162   INT. THE POSHEST ROME HOTEL -- DAY                        162 
The HOTEL MANAGER comes to the front desk to answer a call. 
HOTEL MANAGER Bonjourno. Yes. Yes. Oh...oh, really. Well, absolutely. We can have...I can make our presidential suite available. No, no, no. No trouble at all. We'd love... We're honored that she'd think of us... 
He hangs up.   Turns, elated, to his front desk staff. 
HOTEL MANAGER (SUBTITLED) Julia Roberts is coming to stay with us! 
163   EXT. POSHEST ROME HOTEL -- DAY                            163 
Tess, as Julia Roberts, steps out of a Mercedes limo wearing sunglasses and carrying a puppy. Frank and Basher, as Nation of Islam bodyguards, clear a place in front of her. Reuben trails, dressed in the latest hip-hop clothes. 
A throng of fans and paparazzi rush toward her. Strobes blind us. Fans scream out her name, thrust paper and pen at her for autographs. It's a frigging madhouse. 
PRESS Ms. Roberts! Ms. Roberts! Why did you come back to Rome so soon!! 
TESS I...uh... 
PRESS Was it to see Topher? 
TESS To see what? 
PRESS Topher Grace!! Your co-star!! Is that why you're here?! 
TESS Oh. No. I came to -- to see the-- 
(CONTINUED) 
163   CONTINUED:                                                        163 
PRESS Where's Danny? 
TESS What? 
PRESS Danny, your husband!! 
TESS (looks to Reuben) Well, he's not really-- 
REUBEN Ms. Roberts is very tired!! Please let her through! Please! 
164   INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE -- DAY                                   164 
Tess enters and shuts the door behind her.  She takes a deep breath and exhales. She looks up at Danny, who's there waiting for her. 
TESS I can't do this. 
Danny goes to her.    Kisses her.   Hugs her.    When he steps back he answers: 
DANNY Yes, you can. 
TESS I'm not an actress, Danny!     And I don't look like her! 
DANNY You do, Tess. You really do. I never told you that before, but it's true. 
TESS Come on: my... 
She notions at her body, but we can't tell what part. 
TESS And my... 
She motions at her body again; again it's totally ambiguous what part. 
(CONTINUED) 
164   CONTINUED:                                                  164 
TESS And my ears. Anybody who sees my ears is going to know instantly. 
DANNY Nobody's looking at your ears. 
TESS Yes, Danny, they are.     They're going to know. 
165   INT. DISPLAY ROOM FOR EGG -- MUSEUM OF MODERN ART -- DAY   165 
Isabel stands with the MUSEUM DIRECTOR. 
ISABEL When did that happen? 
There's a knock at the door.   He opens it to see Isabel. 
ISABEL You want to walk? 
174   EXT. ROME -- NIGHT                                          174 
Rusty and Isabel sit on the steps of the Campidoglio. 
ISABEL I know how you're planning to do it. I know Julia's visit is the key. 
RUSTY Who's Julia? 
ISABEL (after a beat) LeMarc knew when to get out. He just quit...with his perfect record intact. Now he's a legend. (exhorting) Don't do this. 
RUSTY LeMarc quit because he was 75 years old, Isabel. He was tired. His doctor told him if he didn't start taking it easy he was going to have another heart attack. You're dramatizing it. 
ISABEL You don't know why LeMarc retired, any better than I do. You have no idea. 
RUSTY Actually, I do. I know exactly why. 
ISABEL Really?    How's that? 
(CONTINUED) 
174   CONTINUED:                                              174 
RUSTY He told me. 
ISABEL (skeptical as hell) You know LeMarc? 
RUSTY A little. 
ISABEL Since when? 
RUSTY Ten years ago. 
ISABEL For how long? 
RUSTY For six months. 
ISABEL You-- 
She's so mad she can hardly speak. 
ISABEL You knew LeMarc? You knew LeMarc and never told me? That's the worst thing you've ever done to me. Nobody knows more about LeMarc than me. How could you do that? 
RUSTY I couldn't tell you, then. 
ISABEL Really awful. 
Isabel thinks. 
ISABEL Then why aren't you as good as Toulour? 
Rusty shrugs. 
A beat. 
(CONTINUED) 
174   CONTINUED: (2)                                               174 
ISABEL I don't want to arrest you, Robert. I really don't. But I will if you make me. I will if you go for that egg. 
Rusty goes silent, looks out at the lights of the city. 
ISABEL So many times, I waited. You can't do that to a person. 
RUSTY Isabel-- 
ISABEL I have to go. 
Isabel gets up...walks away fast.    She's barely holding herself together. 
Rusty watches her go.   Several seconds, then: 
175   FLASHBACK -- INT. APARTMENT BUILDING -- ROME -- DAY         175 
Rusty carries a huge bouquet of flowers up the stairs to the front door of his apartment with Isabel. It's a perfect sunny day outside. He unlocks the door quietly and swings it open to see the apartment is bare. The furniture is still there. But nothing else. Nothing on the walls or the shelves.    Isabel has clearly moved out. Rusty's whole body reacts.... He slowly looks around him, as if in a dream. His eye goes to the dining room table. Isabel's engagement ring is there. 
176   BACK TO SCENE -- EXT. ROME -- CAMPIDOGLIO -- NIGHT          176 
Rusty is still watching Isabel, small now in the distance. She turns the corner out of sight. 
177   EXT. MUSEUM OF MODERN ART -- DAWN                           177 
Isabel pulls up in her car. 
178   INT. MUSEUM OF MODERN ART -- DAWN                          178 
The Egg is being put into position. Isabel watches. 
179   INT. HOTEL SUITE -- DAWN                                   179 
Reuben is talking to Yen. Frank and Livingston get ready in the background. 
REUBEN You're a photographer. Very exacting. You want things a certain way, but you never raise your voice. You're uncompromising. Strong. 
FRANK Reuben, what are you doing? 
REUBEN Oh, we understand each other. I'm mean, the actual words are gibberish to me, but I know what he means. There's a tone, you know. We communicate. I'm sure he'd tell you the same thing. (to Yen) Am I right? 
Yen says something in Chinese. 
ISABEL I want to be on record as saying that you should have shut the entire museum down. 
Isabel keeps her eye on the tourists who circulate through the other wings of the museum. 
183   INT. MUSEUM -- ENTRY HALL -- DAY                              183 
"Julia" arrives flanked by her "Nation of Islam" guards, Frank and Basher. The assembled employees clap and call her name. She waves as they take her picture. 
Topher throws his arm around Julia to make sure he gets in all the shots. The Museum Director comes up to greet "Julia". 
184   INT. SECURITY ROOM                                            184 
Isabel watches the security camera feeds. 
ISABEL There!     Right there! 
Isabel points at a screen showing the museum's other entrance. Rusty nonchalantly slips into the museum. 
185   INT. GALLERY CONTAINING THE CORONATION EGG -- DAY             185 
"Julia" enters and walks up to the egg.       Her entourage follows. 
TESS It's so beautiful.        My God. 
Topher looks at the egg-- 
TOPHER Kinda small. 
He turns away to look a cute girl on the museum staff. 
(CONTINUED) 
185   CONTINUED:                                                  185 
TOPHER Hi. 
BACK ON "JULIA" 
She leans in close to the egg. 
TESS I'm not going to set off any alarms? 
MUSEUM DIRECTOR No. No. Get as close as you like. 
Reuben pops his head in between them. 
REUBEN (obsequious) Julia -- unless you have any objections -- Wen and his crew set up for the publicity stills. 
186   INT. ANOTHER PART OF THE MUSEUM -- DAY                     186 
Rusty ponders a painting like college student trying to impress his art history professor. Finally he moves on, into another gallery. 
PAN to REVEAL nine uniformed cops trailing behind him. 
187   INT. GALLERY CONTAINING THE CORONATION EGG -- DAY          187 
Yen ENTERS FRAME -- dressed like a pretentious grunge rocker. 
He whispers Chinese into a bullhorn. 
Theoretically he's speaking to his crew (Danny, Saul, and Livingston in lame disguises) telling them where to set up the camera, lights, and flags. 
Each "crew member" carries an odd-looking oversized "light meter". Upon closer examination we can see that each device has a small TV screen on it -- which is tapped into the museum's closed circuit system. The guys are carefully placing their flags and lights so as to block the view of the egg from each of the eight cameras on the ceiling of the gallery. 
"Studio Execs," Reuben and Linus go to "Julia." 
(CONTINUED) 
187   CONTINUED:                                                  187 
REUBEN I was thinking maybe we could get you and Topher into some "You Always You Never" hats and t-shirts for the shoot-- 
TESS That's stupid. 
REUBEN (instant reversal) So stupid! (turns to Linus as if it's his idea) Idiot. (gingerly) Maybe we could put some posters in the background-- 
TESS I don't think we want to be so obvious-- 
REUBEN I completely agree! (to Linus) Stop trying to turn this into some sort of stunt. 
188   INT. OTHER PART OF MUSEUM                                  188 
Isabel struts up to Rusty. 
ISABEL This isn't going to work. 
RUSTY I don't know what you're talking about. 
189   INT. GALLERY CONTAINING THE CORONATION EGG -- DAY          189 
Yen stands on two apple boxes to shoot photos of "Julia" and Topher. "Julia" looks ridiculously stiff and keeps putting her hands up to block her ears. 
Topher keeps shooting glances at Danny, who is moving around flags and lights, ostensibly in accordance with Yen's Chinese language orders. 
(CONTINUED) 
189   CONTINUED:                                                  189 
Julia sees Topher's expression -- he recognizes Danny from somewhere... 
JULIA Okay, thanks everybody. Thank you so much. 
She starts to walk out. Topher shrugs and follows her. 
It's Clint Eastwood. 
CLINT Of course she did.   We're married, for God's sake. 
198   INT. HOTEL SUITE -- DAY                                    198 
Tess waits. A key sounds in the door, and she is on her feet. She reaches Danny before he's all the way in the room. She kisses him, then remembers she's mad at him. 
TESS Why didn't you tell me? 
DANNY I couldn't. 
TESS Why not? 
DANNY Because you're not an actress. You wouldn't have been so real. 
(CONTINUED) 
198   CONTINUED:                                                198 
TESS I thought you were going to jail. 
DANNY I'm not going to jail. 
A beat. 
TESS So you don't think I'm a good actress. 
DANNY You're a terrible liar. 
TESS I'm a good liar. 
DANNY Where did Benedict find you? 
TESS He... 
DANNY At your parent's house. 
TESS That was...okay, so I'm not a good liar. So what. You're good enough for both of us. 
DANNY Exactly. 
199   EXT. CIAMPINO AIRPORT -- DAY                             199 
The motorcade of FBI SUV's pulls through the security gate and drives toward a US government Gulfstream parked on the flight line. 
Isabel watches with Captain Giordino and Commander Andriotti. 
Linus, Saul, Yen, Livingston and Reuben get out of the SUVs, all of them beaming. They hug Linus's mom and dad and mount the steps to the plane. Then Rusty gets out, says goodbye to everyone, and heads for Isabel. 
ISABEL (eyes go wide) What the-- Oh my God! (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
199   CONTINUED:                                                  199 ISABEL (cont'd) (spins to Giordano) Call the tower! Don't let that plane take off! 
Giordano stares blankly at her.   But he doesn't move. 
ISABEL (cont'd) Do something! Do you realize what's happening?! Do you understand what's going on?! 
CAPTAIN GIORDANO (deadpan) Yes, absolutely. 
Isabel blinks.   It takes a second to hit her. Rusty approaches. 
RUSTY Guys. Get on there before they leave without you. Thanks. 
CAPTAIN GIORDANO (speaking like an American) Hey, no problem. Good seeing you, man. 
ANDRIOTTI Take care. See you back home. 
RUSTY Thanks, Scooter. 
Isabel is dumbstruck. 
200   EXT. TOULOUR'S VILLA -- DAY                                200 
Toulour pulls up in a Ferrari.    His butler gets the door for him. 
BUTLER How was Rome, air? 
Toulour answers by handing a small velvet bag to his butler (a bag just big enough to hold the coronation egg). 
TOULOUR Put this in the safe, would you? 
(CONTINUED) 
200   CONTINUED:                                                  200 
BUTLER Of course, sir. Your guests are on the veranda. 
TOULOUR Guests? 
201   EXT. CIAMPINO AIRPORT -- DAY                               201 
Isabel watches as the "US Government" Gulfstream containing all the members of Rusty's crew that she arrested at the museum taxis down the runway and becomes airborne. She turns to Rusty. 
ISABEL I hate you. 
RUSTY I love you. 
ISABEL This will ruin me. 
RUSTY No, it won't. Not if you come to Zanzibar. 
He stumbles onward and collapses into a vacant seat. 
LINUS (in French) He's completely drunk. The BackPack Kid nods his head. Linus goes back to his book. We drop down to see HIS BACKPACK also beneath his feet. 
207   INT. TRAIN STATION ROME, ITALY -- DAY                     207 
Linus walks through the terminal, backpack over his shoulder. Suddenly he stops and kneels to tie his shoelace. 
Saul, seeing this and reacting, splits off into another direction. 
208   INT. WAREHOUSE -- DAY                                     208 
Linus and Saul approach the group. 
DANNY What happened? 
Linus puts his BACKPACK down. 
LINUS We thought someone was following us. 
209   BACK TO TOULOUR ON VERANDA - DAY                         209 
TOULOUR But that means you knew what to steal before LeMarc proposed that I challenge you for it. That means... 
210   INT. RUSTY'S GARAGE -- DAY                               210 
The image from the beginning of the film, with Rusty watching the boiling cask. He's talking on the phone. 
RUSTY Gaspar, it's Rusty. How are you? 
And this time we see what be is working on: 
A PERFECT REPLICA OF THE CORONATION EGG. 
In the warehouse in NYC, we see Danny and Rusty "arguing", but from a different angle. They are smiling as they yell: 
DANNY I'M TELLING YOU IT'S A DEATH SENTENCE! 
RUSTY FINE, THEN STAY HERE! 
211   BACK TO TOULOUR ON VERANDA - DAY                         211 
TOULOUR LeMarc told you. Of course. 
He looks deflated. It's probably just occurring to him that he's never lost before. 
He sits down. 
TOULOUR To teach me. 
He is silent. 
Tess indicates to Danny that they should leave. Danny nods, and they rise. 
(CONTINUED) 
211   CONTINUED:                                                211 
DANNY Well, we'll be in touch to make all the arrangements. 
TOULOUR No. Don't go. Please. 
Toulour gets up. 
TOULOUR You are my guests. I will celebrate your victory. Besides, you may have noticed, I don't like to be alone. 
212   EXT. VERANDA -- LATER                                    212 
They are toasting champagne. 
TOULOUR I am feeling more French by the minute. To my first depression. 
213   INT. TAXI -- DAY                                         213 
Saul and Basher ride to the airport. 
BASHER So I think if you really analyze it, you can see that it's inevitable. It's time for us to evolve, en masse. I have to help bring that about whatever way I can, you know. Otherwise, the trajectory is fixed. You know what I'm saying? 
SAUL Mmm. Yes. But I'm through evolving, I think. It's too tiring. I feel pretty evolved. You know, considering. 
214   INT. AIRPORT -- DAY                                      214 
Frank and Yen buy magazines. Yen has a copy of an ITALIAN TABLOID. The headline screams CO-STAR SAYS JULIA MARRIAGE IN TROUBLE. A sub-headline reads HER ADDICTION TO PAINKILLERS IS RIPPING THEM APART. 
215   INT. AIRPLANE -- NIGHT                                     215 
In First Class. Basher and Saul tip champagne glasses. 
Virgil, Turk, and Linus all crack open copies of their story to read. 
TURK I've got an idea for another Dominique story. 
VIRGIL Can we finish this one first? 
TURK Just let me tell it to you. 
VIRGIL No. 
TURK It's like three sentences. 
VIRGIL I'm serious; you're asking too much. 
Virgil puts on his headset. Turk leans over to Linus and begins to speak. Linus, reading, holds his finger up.

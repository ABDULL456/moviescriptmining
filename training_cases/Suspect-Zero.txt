FADE IN: 
...on a BLACK WAVE - vast, oceanic, and coming right at us. BEGIN TITLES. 
The wave is relentless, huge, menacing. We can't tell if this is daytime or night because it simply obscures everything - noisily. It sucks, it yawns, it roars. 
Then we realize... this massive wave of darkness is actually just a RUN-OFF of dirty black WATER alongside the edge of an Interstate. We PULL OUT OF IT now... 
...to find concrete, and garbage, and weeds. END TITLES. 
1   EXT. DITCH - OFF THE INTERSTATE - 4:30 A.M.                      1 
Amongst the refuse is a discarded MILK CARTON, resting on its back. The carton asks "Have You Seen Me?" above a photographed face that's been obscured by grime. 
Yellowing newspaper, old Coke cans, Twinkie wrappers... in that bed of untended weeds. A hollow Texas wind blows through it all. We stay with the carton... 
Then that hollow wind gains speed... and a deep RUMBLE grows in the distance, becoming a ROAR. The yellowed newspaper lifts off and whips past us. 
...as an 18-WHEEL MACK TRUCK blows by, just a blur in the corner of our frame, doing 75 in the pre-dawn darkness. 
Then, the truck is gone, and the rush of air dissipates. The milk carton, the coke cans... they lie undisturbed. 
A LIGHT RAIN begins to fall... and some of the grime washes away from that milk carton, revealing a face. A child. "Have You Seen Me?" It's heartbreaking. TILT UP... to take in the vast flatness of Texas' I-35: concrete forever. In the distance, gray highway yields to black STORMCLOUDS gathering silently over endless prairie. 
A vertical vein of LIGHTNING streaks through one of them. 
CUT TO: 
...a spoon, stirring a cup of coffee. 
2   INT. "THE ALL-AMERICAN DINER" - GAINESVILLE TEXAS - CONTINUING 2 (4:30 A.M.) 
HAROLD SPECK sits: mid 40's, pleasant face. A family man. Reads "Rod and Reel" magazine. Has a SALESMAN'S CASE by his side. Around him is a TRUCK-STOP in twilight: 
Truckers at the counter, Elvis on the wall, a "Drink Bud!" mirror. The WORLD SERIES can be heard on a RADIO... 
DOLLY (O.S.) Top that off for ya, Hon? 
That's DOLLY, a waitress, (50, been here too long.) Speck looks up, smiles thinly, "No." Dolly heads off. Speck returns to his article, underlining a particular passage. 
...until a MAN seats himself, suddenly, in the seat opposite Speck's. Speck reacts, startled. 
SPECK Jesus... 
The MAN's name is O'RYAN. We only see PIECES of him: his eyes, his hands, a stain on his parka... 
O'RYAN What's in the case? 
SPECK I'm sorry? 
O'RYAN You're always lugging that case around. I'm curious. 
Speck looks around: there are plenty of empty tables in here. So why is this guy bothering me??? 
O'RYAN (CONT'D) What do you sell? 
SPECK I'm... in restaurant supplies. I didn't get your name? 
O'RYAN Must travel a lot, huh? 
Speck is looking for Dolly, a Manager, anyone... 
O'RYAN (CONT'D) Whole country, or just hereabouts? 
SPECK I don't mean to be rude but-- 
O'RYAN How's your wife feel about it? 
That spun things a bit. Speck pauses. 
SPECK What? 
O'RYAN She must get lonely, with you gone all the time. Does she? 
SPECK Look, I... 
O'RYAN Do you get lonely? 
Speck's so thrown now he can't answer. 
O'RYAN (CONT'D) Ya miss fucking her, Harold? 
SPECK Listen, I don't know who you are but you can't-- 
O'Ryan silences him... by holding up a piece of paper. On it is a DRAWING. The image faces away from us. But Speck can see it in rich detail. And his eyes go wide. 
We catch GLIMPSES: The color of flesh. A body-part. Looks like a rendering of a young, naked WOMAN. 
And, just like that, Speck finds himself STARING. Glued. 
That's RICK CHARLTON: late 40's, thinning hair, friendly. Charlton heads around a corner. Mackelway follows. 
CHARLTON (CONT'D) Ms. Potter's the nice girl you met at the desk. She puts a package together for all the new agents, things to know about the area, help with finding apartments and such. This one's yours: 
Charlton stops at a CUBICLE: Carpeted walls, formica desk. A corner of dull Hell. Mackelway eyes it, fighting dread. 
CHARLTON (CONT'D) Not so different from Dallas, is it? 
MACKELWAY (fuck yes) No, Sir. 
CHARLTON Good. 
An abandoned SPORTS PAGE tells us about that World Series, so we must be mid-October. Charlton heads out. Mackelway throws a briefcase on to the desk, setting up his world: 
A framed picture of himself and his BROTHER, ages 10 and 15, on a childhood camping trip. Address book, coffee-warmer, calendar, a baseball covered with autographs. 
He opens up a drawer, and casually tosses two bottles of BUFFERIN into the back of it. 
...but first grabs four tablets from one of the bottles, and throws them down his throat, as: 
GRIEVES (O.S.) Ya like Frito Pies? 
Mackelway turns. BILL GRIEVES stands here, holding a white grease-stained paper-bag. Grieves is Mackelway's age, not quite as ambitious. But solid, decent. 
MACKELWAY I dunno. What are they? 
Grieves pulls out a greasy concoction that's wrapped up like a semi-burrito. Pure Texas. Tosses it to Mackelway: 
GRIEVES Welcome to the minors. 
Grieves passes by with a faint smile, handing out lunch to a few other agents. Mackelway eyes the still-wrapped Frito Pie. God, get me outta here... 
CUT TO: 
6   INT. WICHITA FALLS F.B.I. OFFICE - LATER                          6 
A BRIEF MONTAGE: Mackelway, in his cubicle, watching as THOSE OTHER AGENTS take calls, strap on guns, head out on assignment. Men in motion. 
But Mackelway's land-locked, writing up an Auto-Theft report. It's drudgery, but he's meticulous about it, deleting the word "beige" and replacing it with "tan." 
His head is throbbing - not an unusual circumstance for him. But after lingering for a half-second on that "Most-Wanted List" again? Starkey? It's a wound... 
7   INT. F.B.I. OFFICE - KITCHENETTE - MOMENTS LATER                  7 
Mackelway struggles with a COFFEE MACHINE that's unfamiliar to him. Filter, water, grounds, etc. 
KATIE (O.S.) Here. Lemme do that. 
He turns. This is KATIE POTTER. She's 25, friendly, under- challenged by her job. Been here two years. In two seconds she's got the thing percolating. Of course. 
KATIE (CONT'D) It takes some experience. 
He shrugs, not feeling too smooth. 
KATIE (CONT'D) You're Mackelway, right? 
MACKELWAY Mmm-hmm. 
KATIE Fax came in for you. It's the room next door. 
MACKELWAY Oh. Thanks. 
He rises, heads for the "fax room"... 
8   INT. "FAX ROOM" - CONTINUING                                      8 
A former closet, converted into useful space. FIVE FAX MACHINES sit on stands, sharing a surge protector. One fax machine is printing. Mackelway approaches it. 
Six pieces of paper await him. The first is a TOP-SHEET, written by hand: "Attention: Agent Thomas Mackelway, FBI Resident Agency - Wichita Falls." No sender named. 
He looks beneath the top sheet - at Page One of the fax. 
A young BOY stares back at him, his face photostatically copied. Across the top, also-handwritten: "HAVE YOU SEEN ME?" At the bottom of the sheet, typed, we read: 
"Jason Corey, Age 14. Ht. 5'1", Wt. 130, Eyes Brn, Hair Brn. Last Seen: Riverside, Ca. Date of Disappearance: 10-16-99." 
Mackelway eyes the face, then the vitals. No idea why this was sent to him. Then he looks at Page Two. 
A young WOMAN stares back at him this time. Another faxed photo. Another "HAVE YOU SEEN ME?" scrawled across the top of it. And, at the bottom of the sheet: 
"Anna Casitas, Age 22. Ht. 5'6", Wt. 125, Eyes Brn, Hair Blk. Last Seen: Macon, Ga. Date of Disappearance: 5-6-00." 
The other three faxes are more of the same: Pictures and vitals. Faces. Facts. "HAVE YOU SEEN ME?" 
He looks at the bottom of the transmissions, finds the fax number of the sender. Dials it. All he hears back is the loud grainy shriek of a dedicated fax line. 
He eyes the faxes again. It's not alarming, but it's odd. Then Charlton emerges from his office, shouting: 
CHARLTON Mackelway! You gonna sit on your ass all day, or do you wanna do something? 
Mackelway's out of this room in an instant. 
CUT TO: 
9   EXT. REST STOP - OFF THE INTERSTATE - DAY                         9 
Your standard roadside rest-stop: a parking lot with weeds poking through it and bathrooms you wouldn't go near. Those STORMCLOUDS we saw earlier are CLOSER now... 
POLICE CARS and HIGHWAY PATROL MOTORCYCLES fill this site. Charlton's FBI SEDAN pulls up. He and Mackelway get out. 
Two men approach: SHERIFF HARRY DYLAN, 50; and his deputy, BUD GRANGER, a gangly, baby-faced pup. 
MEL Like I said, I never really saw him. Harold came up, complainin' about the guy - but time I turned, he was gone. 
FRAN                      MACK (at Dolly:)               (at Dolly:) Could you de--            Did you get a-- 
They each stop short, waiting for the other to yield. Finally Mackelway nods, "Go ahead." 
FRAN Can you describe him, Ma'am? 
DOLLY Sure. He was... 
Dolly pauses, her face scrunching a bit. Troubled... 
DOLLY (CONT'D) That's weird. Guy was in here better part of an hour. We had a real pleasant chat... But I can't remember a thing about him. For the life of me. Couldn't even tell you what color his eyes were. 
She shrugs apologetically. 
FRAN Happen to see what he was driving? 
DOLLY That one's easy. It's still in the lot. (they perk up) The Bonneville out there with the awful paint job. 
She gestures to the lot, where an old PONTIAC BONNEVILLE sits, its paint stripped down to the primer. Bingo. 
Fran and Mackelway eye it, then one another. 
CUT TO: 
21   EXT. DINER - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER                          21 
Fran and Mackelway emerge, heading for the Bonneville. 
MACKELWAY We ought to work out some kind of protocol. 
FRAN For what? 
MACKELWAY Interviews. Witnesses. Looks pretty silly, our talking over one another. 
FRAN Fine. I'll handle them from now on. 
He doesn't argue. They come to a stop at that Bonneville, stripped down to its primer. Time to work... 
Two agents, all instinct. We see them study things, details, their minds always churning... Mackelway pulls out his Minox, snaps off a few more shots. Then: 
MACKELWAY Trunk's ajar. 
She turns. Sure enough, the Bonneville's trunk is ajar. Mackelway approaches, cautiously. 
He doesn't have gloves on him, so he uses his jacket pocket to protect against prints. He opens the trunk. 
First thing he sees is that SYMBOL again: a circle-with-a- slash-through-it... staring right at him. 
But this time, it's been carved into somebody's back. 
Mackelway stares. So does Fran. Before them lies a body, stripped to the waist: a chunky middle-aged MAN. Dead. 
Mackelway sighs. Things just got tougher... 
CUT TO: 
22   INT. ARCHER COUNTY MORGUE - DAY                                   22 
Harold Speck lies on a table. A BESPECTACLED CORONER examines him. Victim #2, BARNEY FULCHER, lies on another, his ample frame yet to be examined. 
The lights are out, but that Coroner wears a FLUORESCENT HALO, with a MICROPHONE pinned to his gown. He speaks into it with a quiet monotone: anatomical terms, etc. 
Mackelway and Fran are here... watching. Mackelway is particularly focused on Fulcher's face. His EYELIDS, we now see, have also been torn off. Hmmmm... 
FRAN Why eyelids? 
MACKELWAY Huh? 
FRAN No other signs of torture here. Why take somebody's eyelids off? 
MACKELWAY So they can't blink. 
She sighs, aloud: "I know that already, Asshole." Coroner keeps his head down, speaking into that microphone. 
MACKELWAY (CONT'D) It's a metaphor - to make certain the victim sees... or to make certain that we see something. (she's silent) Or maybe it's just a fuck-you. 
Coroner continues his monotone narration... then crosses to the sink. 
That puts him out of earshot. So: 
MACKELWAY (CONT'D) (to Fran, quietly) I'm sorry about Don. 
FRAN (thrown) Huh? 
MACKELWAY You're not wearing your ring anymore. 
That was an attempt at kindness. She knows that. Still, she eyes her left hand, self-consciously, while Mackelway loses himself in those lidless eyes of Fulcher's... 
Then there's a KNOCK AT THE GLASS WINDOW BEHIND THEM. 
They turn. Charlton stands on the other side of a GLASS WINDOW, in a VIEWING ROOM adjacent to this Morgue. He presses a piece of paper up against the glass. 
On it, in typed bold letters at the top, we read: "MATCHES ONE OF ONE." Below that we see that Circle-with-the-slash- through-it. 
This is a FAX, which Charlton's just received. He points further down on the fax at what look like little squiggles at first, until we move in to discover it is a hand drawn street map. 
The ink bleeds a bit due to a poor fax transmission. Those scrawled lines take us to "The Hope House," in Oklahoma City. At the bottom a scribbled name, "David Dyson," and a contact number. 
Moving closer to the glass, Mackelway nods. He just got a break... 
MACKELWAY (CONT'D) Wait. 
They stop. Something just caught Mackelway's eye, visible beneath these stairs: a BOX, with a bucket of PAINT sticking out of it... 
28   INT. BASEMENT - BENEATH THE STAIRS - CONTINUING                  28 
Mackelway climbs under the stairs, crouching down, pushing aside all of the aforementioned junk. He grabs the box. 
Sure enough, that bucket once held red paint - same color O'Ryan used to cover that wall. There's also a bucket of BLACK PAINT here. And some used brushes. 
Mackelway brings the box into the meager light. We get a look INSIDE IT now. So does Dyson. 
Inside, beneath the paint-buckets, we see a few TV GUIDES, a yo-yo, a football. Then a BOOK on TRIBAL RITUAL AND TRANCE. Mackelway grabs it, eyes it. 
He flips through a few pages - odd images: a TRIBESMAN with eyes rolling back in his head, strange rites, etc. 
Mackelway sets the book down. Then, amidst the other materials in this box, he spots a large folded MAP. 
He grabs it, begins to unfold it. We see that this map's been written on, in pen. Cities on it have been CIRCLED. 
But before we can get a good look at it, Mackelway spots something else, at the bottom of this box, a shocker: 
A photograph of himself. 
It takes him a second to realize what he's looking at. But there it is, a NEWSPAPER PHOTO, of Agent Thomas Mackelway. 
It is part of a FRONT-PAGE STORY, dated July of this year, concerning the trial and release...of Virgil Ray Starkey. #7 on the F.B.I.'s Most-Wanted List... 
Dyson can't help but notice the picture of Mackelway. 
Mackelway stares. Suddenly we JUMP BACK IN TIME, NINE MONTHS, for a brief, choppy FLASHBACK. 29   EXT. STREET - MATAMOROS - NIGHT - MACKELWAY'S FLASHBACK We're RUNNING, dashing between two buildings of chipped-adobe, hearing nothing but the sound of our own breathing and the thuds of our own heavy feet. 
This is Matamoros, Mexico, a shit-hole of a border town. Squalor and sin. We find a DRUNK MEXICAN TEEN. He nods: "This is the place," and sticks out his palm. 
30   INT. HOPE HOUSE - BASEMENT - RESUMING                          30 
Mackelway stares at that newspaper: Starkey - rapist, murderer, whose case was just thrown out of court - a stunning failure for all involved. 
...as we RESUME MACKELWAY'S FLASHBACK - Matamoros again... 
31   INT. "CLUB" - BACKSTAGE - RESUMING FLASHBACK                   31 
Bad-lighting, drunk patrons in a CIRCLE, and a DONKEY-SHOW taking place on a bare stage. Feels like we've stepped into some kind of evil carnival. It's dizzying. 
Among the crowd: Virgil Starkey, in an ugly drunken binge, the only guy in here who isn't cheering or laughing. 
Suddenly our GUN is pointed right at his head. 
Starkey freezes, caught. Some of the PATRONS around him find somewhere else to stand... But the show goes on. 
32   INT. HOPE HOUSE - BASEMENT - RESUMING                          32 
That ARTICLE gives us more detail now, the reason Starkey's case was thrown out of court. It is this: 
The F.B.I. Agent on the case had made a mistake in "evidentiary procedure." Hence, Mackelway's picture. 
On his face, we GO BACK TO ANOTHER MEMORY: six months ago. 
33   INT. COURTHOUSE - ANTEROOM - DAY - ANOTHER FLASHBACK           33 
Three months have passed since the arrest in Matamoros. Now Mackelway sits in this courthouse ANTEROOM, adjacent to a courtroom. Four sour PROSECUTORS surround him. 
PROSECUTOR #1 D'you understand how fucked we are? 
MACKELWAY Yes, Sir. 
PROSECUTOR #1 Leaving a tissue sample in the care of a Mexican lab? Are you fucking kidding me? 
MACKELWAY They assured me that they understood protocol. 
PROSECUTOR #1 Well guess what? They didn't. And this prick's gonna walk, ten murders or not. 
That registered. 
34   INT. HOPE HOUSE - BASEMENT - RESUMING                             34 
Beneath this newspaper article are OTHER ARTICLES, all concerning Starkey: his crimes, his capture, all of it. 
Mackelway's memory just got stoked again: 
35   INT. COURTHOUSE - HALLWAY - RESUMING FLASHBACK                    35 
Mackelway emerges from that courthouse anteroom, whipped. 
The hall's busy with MEDIA and other traffic. First face he sees is Fran, who sits on a bench, (wedding ring ON). Her eyes say how lousy she feels for him. It almost helps. 
36   INT. COURTHOUSE BATHROOM - CONTINUING FLASHBACK                   36 
The door bursts open and Mackelway storms in. No need to look composed now; he's alone in here. He crosses to a paper-towel dispenser, SLUGS IT. Stares in the mirror. 
He's livid, embarrassed, frustrated - can barely look at his own reflection. 
Then he hears LAUGHTER, behind him. He turns. 
Out of the darkness of a badly-lit STALL, Virgil Starkey emerges, coming into view under a single light. 
Beside him is a GRIM COP, his chaperone. Starkey passes by Mackelway, almost snickering. Then he's gone. Mackelway shuts his eyes tight. His head is pounding. END FLASHBACK. 
37   INT. HOPE HOUSE - BASEMENT - RESUMING                             37 
Mackelway stares... at a record of his deepest wound. But what the hell is it doing in the locker of a transient? 
42   EXT. A BAR - SLEEPER, MISSOURI - CONTINUING                       42 
A typical honky-tonk in a town called Sleeper, Missouri. Just across the street from O'Ryan's cheap motel... 
43   INT. BAR - SLEEPER, MISSOURI - CONTINUING                        43 
Low-lights, dust on the floor. Pool tables. 
LORETTA is a pretty 19-year-old who stands at the jukebox, weighing her choices. She's got a thick curtain of hair, which she wrangles with a CHIP-CLIP. It's a habit. 
She chooses a country-rock tune, then heads for the bar, walking to the beat. It's fun being 19 and beautiful. 
44   AT THE BAR - CONTINUING                                          44 
The BARTENDER'S a stocky guy with a broad smile. 
LORETTA (re: song) How's that? 
BARTENDER Little cute for my taste, but I can stand three minutes of it. 
LORETTA I'll have a seven and seven, please. 
BARTENDER Seven and seven. Got some i.d.? 
She half-laughs, as if she hasn't been carded in a decade, and throws that curtain of hair from one side to the other, re- fastening that chip-clip. It's her best move. 
LORETTA It's in the car. No one's asked me for it for a couple years now. 
BARTENDER If ya hurry, you'll still catch the end of the song. 
She eyes him: are you really carding me? He smiles: nothing personal, Sugar. So she heads for the door. 
...on her way, she passes a booth. In it we find a familiar face - Virgil Ray Starkey... 
He remains still, as if he hadn't noticed her. But behind his eyes, something primal just took place. He rises, heads for the door. 
45   EXT. BAR - MOMENTS LATER                                          45 
Loretta walks to her VW Bug. Starkey exits the bar. She doesn't notice. We TILT UP: the lights are off in O'Ryan's motel room... 
46   EXT. AT LORETTA'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER                             46 
It all happens pretty fast: That chip-clip hits the ground beside the open VW door. A battered PICK-UP speeds away, kicking up gravel. 
CUT TO: 
...Loretta's eyes, wide with terror and dread. 
47   INT. STARKEY'S PICK-UP - MINUTES LATER                            47 
We're off-road. Missouri's woods can be seen through the windshield. And Starkey is staring at us. Pawing at us... 
LORETTA Please, Mister... 
Starkey's hand shoots out, banging Loretta's head against the window, hard. That makes things start to swim. Starkey tears at her clothes, lowers himself on to her. 
She whimpers. WE CARRY THE SOUND OF IT INTO: 
48   INT. MACKELWAY'S APARTMENT - SAME                                 48 
This is where you go when you've just moved to Wichita Falls and money's tight: spotty shag carpet, chipped Formica kitchen table, scuffed blinds. 
...and one sleepless agent, having one lousy night. 
Mackelway sits on the edge of his bed, almost able to hear Loretta's helpless cries. Some nights are like this. His head is POUNDING again. Down go four more Bufferin. 
Above him, covering the bedroom mirror, is the MAP he took from that Hope House basement. O'Ryan's map, UNFOLDED. 
It's HUGE: 6-feet-wide, 4-feet-tall, obscuring the mirror. 
As we glimpsed while still in that basement, this map his been written on, in pen. O'Ryan's notations cover it: Over a THUSAND CITIES on it have been CIRCLED, by hand, in RED. Each of those circled cities has a DATE written beside it, also in red: ("4/6," "5/19," "10-26," etc.) 
Mackelway studies it, his face working. Another of those WHIMPERS from Loretta seems to hang, suspended. Mackelway shakes it off, certain that he's imagining it. 
He won't sleep a wink tonight. We LEAVE HIM, returning to: 
49   INT. STARKEY'S PICK-UP - RESUMING                                 49 
The attack continues, its terror unimaginable. Loretta sobs. It hurts. Starkey's too powerful to fight off. We stay on her face: dazed, her mind simply checking out. 
...until a look of cognizance comes over her, brought on by a SHADOW that just passed by. 
Then the window behind Starkey simply EXPLODES. 
Glass flies everywhere, and TWO ARMS reach into the pick-up. They grab Starkey by the neck and yank him out of the pick-up, his back sliced open by shards. He screams. 
She can't resist coming to the window, where she sees: 
50   EXT. WOODS - STARKEY'S PICK-UP - CONTINUING                       50 
Starkey lies, face up. Shocked. Squirming. Bleeding. Standing over him, looming large as a Grizzly... is O'Ryan. A long HUNTING KNIFE extends from his hand. 
But his tone, to our great surprise, is conversational: 
O'RYAN Hey, listen, I'm sorta new in town. Ya know where I can find a good donkey show? 
Starkey has no idea how to respond to this maniac: 
STARKEY Huh? 
O'RYAN Oh. Forgot. Wrong country... In America animals have rights. (pointedly) Don't they, Virgil? 
Of course, O'Ryan had circled "Macon" too. Beside it he'd written "5-6." So Macon gets a yellow pin. 
Mackelway continues, as: 
FRAN (O.S.) Got nothing on the last fax. 
Mackelway turns. In comes Fran. 
FRAN (CONT'D) Came from a business center at a Mariott in Dallas. Nobody saw who sent it. 
Mackelway nods. Then they both turn... Charlton enters the room. 
CHARLTON Whadda we know about the map? 
MACKELWAY It matches the faxes, Sir. Almost perfectly. 
Charlton approaches the map: 1,242 cities, circled in red. Mackelway continues with the yellow pins: one for every HAVE YOU SEEN ME? (45 of them so far.) 
Charlton eyes the stack. 45 HAVE YOU SEEN ME's... Then the map: 1,242 cities. Each with a DATE beside it. 
CHARLTON Why's Greenville in blue? 
(Mackelway has put a yellow pin beside a dozen cities... but tiny Greenville, Texas has a BLUE PIN beside it.) 
MACKELWAY Only city where the date on the fax and the date on the map didn't correspond. 
He pulls out a fax from the stack: a Korean boy named "Steven Kim. Age 16. Last Seen: Greenville, Tx. Date of Disappearance: 
MACKELWAY (CONT'D) Fax lists the date of disappearance as August 7. On the map he's written "10- 
The DATE on O'Ryan's map reads "10-26" beside Greenville, Tx. So Greenville gets the only blue pin on this map. 
Charlton notes today's date: October 17... 
CHARLTON Any of these bodies been recovered? 
MACKELWAY Two so far. Female, disappeared from Dayton, Ohio on April 12. And a male, Trenton, New Jersey, January 5th. 
On the MAP, Dayton's got "4/12" written beside it. Trenton has "1/5." Both have yellow pins in them. 
MACKELWAY (CONT'D) But both bodies were found over a thousand miles from where they'd last been seen. One in Montana, the other in Oregon. Got autopsy reports on both. 
Charlton looks to the table, where AUTOPSY REPORTS and AUTOPSY PHOTOS sit - two victims we've never seen before. 
We see the VICTIMS photographed face up, face down, waist and above, waist and below. Charlton gives the photos a cursory glance, nothing more. 
But we notice something, on one of the bodies: the male from Trenton - an odd BURN MARK on his lower left calf. 
Looks almost symmetrical, horizontal across the calf... 
CHARLTON Either of the bodies have the zero on them? 
MACKELWAY No, Sir. 
Charlton, frustrated, SHOVES THOSE AUTOPSY PHOTOS ASIDE. We look to that MAP, a handful of yellow pins in it... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
...that same map, over a HUNDRED YELLOW PINS in it now. 
55   INT. FBI OFFICE - "O'RYAN ROOM" - NIGHT                          55 
It's 8:30 at night. Mackelway is alone in here - staring at the map. He's been doing a lot of that lately. 
The stack of HAVE YOU SEEN ME's has grown as well. Every one of them corresponds to a yellow pin on the map. 
(Some of the HAVE YOU SEEN ME's have arrived via U.S. MAIL. We see a stack of ENVELOPES in a box, each sealed in PLASTIC, each stamped and addressed to Mackelway.) 
Mackelway eyes the map, puzzling. Fran's right beside him. Assorted papers and leads fill this room, including photos he took himself with that Minox. 
FRAN Why you? 
MACKELWAY Huh? 
FRAN He could be sending these to any agent in any office in the country... But he's sending them to you. Why? 
Mackelway's been asking himself that same question lately. 
MACKELWAY I don't know. 
PHONE RINGS. She grabs it. 
FRAN (INTO PHONE) This is Agent Kulok. (a beat) Who's calling? 
She hears the answer, then covers the phone. 
FRAN (CONT'D) (to Mackelway:) Do you know a professor named Daitz? Says he's from Tulane. 
MACKELWAY (eagerly) Yeah. Criminal Psych. I've been trading e- mails with him. 
FRAN (INTO PHONE) One moment, please... 
She hands him the phone... 
CUT TO: 
56   EXT. TULANE UNIVERSITY - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT                     56 
A beautiful campus, quiet tonight. In its center lies a vast, expensive structure - the Behavioral Sciences Building. The place goes on forever. 
57   INT. TULANE - BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES BUILDING - SAME                 57 
It's dark behind them, shadowy. Not a bad place to hide. 
Farther down the corridor is another door - made of frosted glass. A sign on it reads "Neuropsychiatric Lab." That's where the sound came from... he thinks. 
65   INT. SUB-BASEMENT - LAB - CONTINUING                              65 
Mackelway enters. The lab is dark. He throws on every light switch within reach... and finds himself standing over the shards of what used to be a GLASS BEAKER. 
So he's in the right place. He scans it: five rows of work- stations, ten microscopes per row, each with a sink beside it. Lining the walls are wide CABINETS. 
But there's also a MINI-LIBRARY down here: Four rows of BOOKSHELVES, housing medical journals. These are the "stacks" - perfect for hiding behind. 
He plunges in. Row #1. Doesn't see anyone. Then Row #2, Row #3, Row #4. Okay, the stacks check out... 
He walks along the rows of work-stations, scanning, crouching, nudging open cabinets. One has been opened: 
Bottles of SOLUTIONS sit inside it. And a JAR that's been unsealed: It's got GAUZE PADS in it... 
In the back of the room, an INSTRUCTOR'S DESK awaits. It's tall enough to hide beneath. Mackelway slinks around it. Kneels down, looking into darkness... 
Then, a NOISE. The FRONT DOOR of this lab just swung open... And O'Ryan just bolted out. Fuck. 
66   INT. SUB-BASEMENT - CORRIDOR - CONTINUING                         66 
Mackelway emerges from the lab. Those furnaces whine beside him on the other side of that cage. But a GATE on that cage has been left ajar... 
67   INT. "FURNACE ROOM" - CONTINUING                                  67 
Five furnaces, separated from the sub-basement corridor by steel mesh. Mackelway enters. A few meager BULBS burn. 
He moves amidst shadow and noise: the chugging of engines, the humming, the wheezing, a slight vibration to the floor beneath us. He walks along the edge of Furnace #1... 
...and is assaulted, from above. 
O'Ryan falls on him, knocking Mackelway hard into the sharp CORNER of that furnace, then down to the ground. Mackelway's gun skids across the floor. 
And his mouth, suddenly, has been covered with gauze. 
He wants to fight back... but suddenly he finds that his head is swimming. Something's on that gauze. The room is getting fuzzy. 
We see the belly of a furnace - flames, heat. Then our own BLOOD... (Mackelway's CHEST was torn open by the corner of that furnace.) Wait. Did we just see the glint of a KNIFE? 
O'Ryan is leaning over us, in utter control. 
Then O'Ryan's head turns, abruptly - at the sound of FOOTSTEPS. And we hear: 
MALE VOICE (O.S.) Hey! You! What're you doing down here! 
We turn, groggily. TWO JANITORS rush toward us, keys jangling. It's all foggy, wavy, distorted. 
We see O'Ryan RISE. Then everything goes black... 
CUT TO: 
68   INT. A HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING                                   68 
Mackelway's head is ringing. Feels like he can hear electricity in the walls around him. Slowly, he awakens. Above him are fluorescent lights. Monitors blink... 
Fran is here. So's Charlton. Mackelway tries to sit up. The shock of pain from his chest stops him. 
FRAN How ya doin'? 
Mackelway half-nods. His chest is bandaged. 
CHARLTON We're gonna need everything you can remember about this guy, Tom. Physical description, any kind of distinguishing characteristics. 
That was terse. Charlton looks pretty pissed-off. 
MACKELWAY (scratchy) Where is he? 
CHARLTON The suspect fled. Couple janitors walked in on it. (before Mack can ask:) (MORE) 
CHARLTON (CONT'D) They're fine. But the description they gave of him wasn't worth a damn. 
Mackelway nods. 
CHARLTON (CONT'D) Case you're curious the real Professor Daitz is on sabbatical, out of the country. We can't find him. (Mackelway nods) Whose idea was it to meet there? 
MACKELWAY His, Sir. 
CHARLTON Uh-huh. Did he ask you to come alone? 
MACKELWAY No, Sir. 
CHARLTON But you figured you'd get a bigger pat on the head if you wrapped this whole thing up without any help - is that it? 
The truth? Charlton has him pegged. But: 
FRAN Sir, I'm the one who took the call. Agent Mackelway was acting under the assumption that I'd already checked the guy out. We're both to blame. 
Hold it. That was a major exaggeration, if not an outright lie. Mackelway eyes her, thrown. She's poker-faced. 
Charlton, however, seems unmoved... 
CHARLTON Did Agent Mackelway attend the interview unaccompanied? 
FRAN (reluctantly) Yes, Sir. 
CHARLTON Then whose fuck-up is it? 
Mackelway eyes her: "Thanks for trying." She nods. 
He walks away from the church, into that heavy rain. 
81   INT. FBI OFFICE - "FAX ROOM" - RESUMING                           81 
The fax tray has overflown onto the floor - 200 more photos, 200 more HAVE YOU SEEN ME's. Forgotten victims. We hear a last rumble from that 18-WHEELER. END INTERCUT... 
CUT TO: 
82   INT. FBI OFFICE - "O'RYAN ROOM" - LATE NIGHT                      82 
Now there are 800 YELLOW PINS stuck in this map - one for every single FAX or LETTER that's been received in the past weeks. 
800 faces. 800 HAVE YOU SEEN ME's, represented by 800 pins in 800 cities. It's like a national plague. 
Mackelway sits, examining it soberly. His chest-wound is killing him. (We see a thick bandage beneath his shirt.) 
In his pocket now is a bottle of PRESCRIPTION PILLS. Percodan. He slugs one down without water, his eyes never straying from that map. 
Beside it is a COMPOSITE DRAWING from O'Ryan, taken from Mackelway's description. It's dead-on... 
CUT TO: 
83   EXT. LONGHORN DINER WICHITA FALLS - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING          83 
This is the lone source of light on an otherwise dark stretch of road. Mackelway's Yukon pulls up. 
84   INT. LONGHORN DINER WICHITA FALLS - MOMENTS LATER                 84 
Hardly a sound in here. Mackelway stands at the register, paying for his TAKE-OUT. Another night with nothing but his thoughts for company. Great. Then: 
A YOUNG WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Agent Mackelway? 
It's Katie, the receptionist from his office - sitting by herself in a nearby booth. Mackelway smiles. 
KATIE (CONT'D) Hi. 
CUT TO: 
85   INT. KATIE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - LATER NIGHT                    85 
Inexpensive, but furnished with all the touches that Mackelway's apartment lacks: flea-market stuff, lace, antique books, photos from other eras. Character. 
And candles. Lots of candles. They throw SHADOWS of Mackelway and Katie all over the walls. 
An odd MUSIC fills the room, coming from a BOOM-BOX on the floor. It's a rhythmic Navajo CHANT, with Native-American drums providing the pulse. 
It's eery, tuneless, but awfully authentic... and it fits the intensity of the moment: Mackelway and Katie, coupling madly, their eyes locked. She's breathless. 
First time we've seen him shirtless since his injury in that furnace room. A FAT BANDAGE covers a quarter of his chest. Dried blood can be seen beneath it. 
There's an intensity in his eyes. The chanting, the candles, Katie's body, his wound... they've conspired to bring an intensity into his eyes. It's dark, primal. 
And he's been expressing it for an hour without relent... which is why Katie gasps one last gasp, then rolls to the edge of the bed, exhausted. 
She reaches for that boom-box, lowers the volume. The chanting dies down into silence. She catches her breath. 
KATIE (softly) I can't anymore. 
Mackelway eyes her, then reaches past her, and turns the VOLUME on that boom-box back UP. The chanting fills the room again. 
And just like that, he has pulled her back onto him, urgently. That primal side hasn't been sated yet... 
CUT TO: 
86   INT. KATIE'S APT. - BATHROOM - LATER NIGHT                       86 
Mackelway stands at the mirror, changing the dressing on that wound across his chest. He unwraps the gauze over that fat bandage soaked through with blood. 
He pulls the bandage off, giving us a better look at the deep gash. Dried blood, torn skin, bruising. Looks like hell. But Mackelway eyes it calmly. 
He slugs down some beer from a nearby bottle, then cleans the wound with some Hydrogen Peroxide... as Katie appears in the doorway. She eyes him. 
KATIE Can't sleep? 
He shrugs, turns. 
MACKELWAY What was that music? 
KATIE It's Navajo. A song for dead warriors. I never played it for anybody before. (MORE) 
KATIE (CONT'D) (a beat) Just had a feeling you'd like it. 
MACKELWAY How? 
KATIE I dunno. The way you stare when you think nobody's looking. 
She shrugs. Silence hovers... 
CUT TO: 
87   INT. KATIE'S APT. - BEDROOM - PRE-DAWN                            87 
4:30 a.m. Rain pounds the window and roof, a real storm out there. The boom box is still. The candles are down to their nubs. Katie continues to sleep. Mackelway too. 
Then his eyes SNAP OPEN. 
Something just hit him, something huge. One of those 4:30-in- the-morning ideas that has to be expressed. Now. 
CUT TO: 
88   INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - 5 A.M.                                       88 
JAN No. Why? 
He shrugs, dismissing it: 
MACKELWAY It's nothing. Trace elements we found on his trunk. Any interest in chemistry? Maybe as a hobby? 
Jan pauses for a moment, as if recovering a faint memory... Then she shakes it off. He lets it go. 
MACKELWAY (CONT'D) Anyway, thank you. And thanks for the coffee. Next time I'll call first, I promise. 
JAN No trouble at all. 
CUT TO: 
92   EXT. SPECK'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER                                 92 
Mackelway sits in his car. Through his windshield we see Jan as she backs out of the driveway. 
She pulls past us, giving Mackelway as friendly a wave as a grieving widow can give. He waves back. 
Then she's gone, disappearing around a corner. 
Mackelway pauses a beat, checking his rear-view mirror to be sure. Then he gets out of his car... 
CUT TO: 
93   EXT. SPECK'S HOUSE - SIDE GATE - MOMENTS LATER                     93 
Mackelway sneaks around the side of the house, pulling on a lever to unlatch the side-gate. 
94   EXT. SPECK'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - CONTINUING                         94 
He emerges into the tiny backyard, making a bee-line for that storm cellar door. 
He knows he shouldn't be doing this. It's beyond risky. But here he is, without a warrant. 
There's no lock on the cellar door. He reaches for it. Then he stops himself. Just noticed something: A NEIGHBOR-LADY, visible just over Speck's backyard fence, is looking right at him through her bedroom window. 
Fuck it. He enters the storm cellar. 
95   INT. SPECK'S STORM CELLAR - CONTINUING                             95 
Seven steps, leading to a dusty cement floor. Mackelway looks around. 
Facing him are the things a meticulous man would store in case of disaster: Cans of food, sternos, sleeping mats, drums of potable water. 
And long FOOT-LOCKERS. Two of them. That's where Mackelway's eyes go, instantly. He hurries to them. 
Throws one open. Nothing but sheets and blankets inside. He paws through it... finding nothing else. 
He throws the other trunk open. Inside? Pillows. Fuck. 
He slams it shut, looks to those cans of food, stacked on shelves. He approaches the shelves, jostling cans from their rows, making more noise than he ought to. 
But he finds nothing behind them... except more cans. He approaches those two huge drums of water, lugs them aside. Behind them is a tall CUPBOARD, locked. 
He pulls at the cupboard door, hard. It splinters. 
Inside, a rifle and some boxes of ammo... same as you'd find in every other storm-cellar in Texas. 
He pauses: Am I crazy...? 
CUT TO: 
96   EXT. SPECK'S BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER                            96 
He emerges from the storm-cellar, confused. Shuts the storm- cellar door. 
Then he turns. Something else just caught his eye: 
Above Speck's bedroom window is another window, a tiny one. An attic... 
He heads for that UNLOCKED BACK DOOR, and enters... 
97   INT. SPECK'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUING                    97 
He hurries toward the stairs, reaches them... then spots something through the Entry Hall window: 
On the street outside, pulling up to the curb... is a POLICE CAR. Sirens off. That Neighbor-Lady must've placed the call. And here's Mackelway, without a warrant. Shit. 
Two ABILENE COPS get out, approaching the house. Mackelway climbs the stairs. 
98    INT. SPECK'S HOUSE - STAIRS - CONTINUING                        98 
If he stays quiet, he might just pull this off. 
99    INT. SPECK'S HOUSE - SECOND STORY - CONTINUING                  99 
A tiny hallway, with four doors. Up ahead, dangling from the ceiling, is a tiny rope which promises a set of hidden fold- out stairs... and an attic. 
Mackelway tugs on the rope. The fold-out stairs drop down out of the ceiling. Then he hears: 
NEIGHBOR LADY (O.S.) He's inside! He's inside! Went in through the back! 
...which means he has mere seconds before this all blows to hell. So he climbs up those fold-out stairs. 
The two ABILENE COPS now circle the house, entering through the back-porch door, just as Mackelway did. 
He pulls up the folding stairs. Maybe the guys'll do a half- assed search and then leave... 
100   INT. SPECK'S HOUSE - ATTIC_- CONTINUING                        100 
The agents find seats around the table. Charlton takes his place at the head of it. 
CHARLTON (CONT'D) (to the assembled:) Okay. We've got a serial killer of serial killers. 
Fran scribbles something on a piece of paper: "What a genius!" Slides it over. Mackelway conceals the note, as: 
CHARLTON (CONT'D) (still grand-standing) He's a transient with a history of mental illness. He also happens to think he's a former agent of this Bureau. And he is pursuing something that he calls "Suspect Zero." Anybody got anything intelligent to say? 
Nobody's volunteering.   There's just silence. 
CHARLTON (CONT'D) (familiar refrain) That's what I thought... 
CUT TO: 
104   OMIT                                                             104 
105   EXT. WICHITA FALLS FBI OFFICE - PARKING LOT - NIGHT              105 
Mackelway exits the office, heading for his Yukon. 
Then he stops... because Katie is waiting out here, leaning against her Toyota Camry. 
MACKELWAY (fondly) Hey. 
KATIE Somethin', huh? Guy with a wife and kids keepin' bodies in his attic? 
He nods... but what is she doing out here? 
MACKELWAY Yeah. (a beat) You okay? 
KATIE Yeah. Just... Wondered if you could do me a favor. 
Mackelway waits... as Katie hands over a manila envelope. Mackelway opens it. 
Inside, a photo of a heartbreakingly-sweet 22 year-old girl named KAREN SUMPTER, with an attached sheet listing her vitals: height, weight, age, etc. 
Another face. Another disappearance... 
KATIE (CONT'D) Her name's Karen Sumpter. We were friends. (almost reluctantly) She disappeared last year. Nobody knows where. She was a little wild, but not like that. 
Her sadness is obvious. Mackelway nods. 
KATIE (CONT'D) Anyway, I know you're gonna be in on the autopsies - of the girls they found over at Speck's. Figured you might see if one of 'em was... 
Her voice trails off. This is hard. 
KATIE (CONT'D) If it is, I'd like to be the one to notify her folks. Out families've been friends for years. 
MACKELWAY (gently) Sure. Of course. 
KATIE Thanks... 'Night. 
Mackelway puts the envelope under his arm. She starts up the Camry. The sky rumbles. He eyes her. 
For some reason, she hasn't pulled away yet... 
SMASH CUT TO: 
106   INT. KATIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                      106 
Candles. Shadows on the wall...and Mackelway and Katie, at it again, with the sounds of that eery Navajo CHANTING coming from the boom-box. 
Mackelway is studying her, staring into her eyes, her breathing. She's beginning to climax now... and those eyes go wider. We MOVE INTO THEM, and: 
We are abruptly SLAMMED, again, INTO ANOTHER SET OF THOSE ODD, DISJOINTED IMAGES from that unidentified place: 
107   EXT. DARKNESS - UNIDENTIFIED TIME - NIGHT                        107 
Wet wind in a blur of gray. The sound of our own heavy breathing. A voice rising above the wind, pleading: 
(O.S.) Please... 
108   INT. KATIE'S BEDROOM - RESUMING                                  108 
She is utterly lost now. And that CHANTING seems to have gotten louder somehow. 
IMAGES FLICK at us now: culled from that BOOK on TRIBAL RITUAL AND TRANCE, found at the halfway house: a TRIBESMAN with eyes rolling back in his head, foaming at the mouth. 
Mackelway tries to shake it off, tries to keep his focus on Katie. He buries his head into her neck, as: 
109   EXT. WHEAT FIELD - NIGHT                                         109 
Tall wheat, wet wind. Then a MUZZLE FLASH, and a body slumping to the ground. And suddenly we are in: 
110   INT. ANOTHER UNIDENTIFIED MOTEL ROOM - DENTON, TEXAS - NIGHT 110 
O'Ryan, at a desk. He has just "remote viewed" these images somehow. And they've left him rattled. 
It's time to get out of this room. Quickly. 
CUT TO: 
111   EXT. ROAD - DENTON, TEXAS - SAME (NIGHT)                         111 
A stolen, non-descript CHEVY pulls out of a motel room parking lot, on to the street. 
112   INT. STOLEN CAR - DRIVING - CONTINUING                           112 
O'Ryan is behind the wheel, driving. 
113   INT. STOLEN CAR - DRIVING - MOMENTS LATER (DUSK)                  113 
The door bursts open. The greasy bag and the soda fall to the floor. Mackelway hurries to a phone, clutching that file. He dials hurriedly. 
119   INTERCUT WITH/INT. FRAN'S CAR - SAME                           119 
We're in a PARKING LOT outside a WAL-MART. Fran's just thrown a bag into her Ford Taurus. Her CEL-PHONE RINGS. She grabs it. 
FRAN (INTO CEL) Kulok. 
MACKELWAY (INTO PHONE) He really was FBI. 
FRAN Huh? 
MACKELWAY O'Ryan. He left his file on my doorstep. Fran, he was FBI. 
He can barely believe it himself, but we get a look at what was in that file now; PAGES are splayed across Mackelway's coffee table: 
A copy of an FBI I.D. BADGE, xeroxed memoes, test scores, citations, evaluations, reports. The entire career of Special Agent Benjamin O'Ryan... in black and white. 
FRAN That's impossible. 
MACKELWAY I'm look at his whole history! Citations, letters of commendation, even his fucking test scores from Quantico. The guy was an agent. 
FRAN I don't believe it. 
MACKELWAY Listen to me-- 
Then we hear a BEEP. Call-Waiting. Great. 
MACKELWAY (CONT'D) Shit! Hold on. 
That irritated her. Mackelway clicks over. 
MACKELWAY (CONT'D) Yes? 
O'RYAN (THRU PHONE) Read anything interesting lately? 
Mackelway's eyes go wide. 
MACKELWAY Where are you? 
CLICK. O'Ryan's just hung up. 
MACKELWAY (CONT'D) Shit! 
He stares at the phone, then clicks over again, re-connecting to Fran. 
MACKELWAY (CONT'D) That was him. 
FRAN He called you at home? 
MACKELWAY Yes. 
BEEP. Call-Waiting again. 
FRAN Jesus. Call me back. 
Mackelway clicks over again without saying goodbye. 
MACKELWAY (INTO PHONE) O'Ryan? 
O'RYAN (THRU PHONE) I've found him, you know. 
MACKELWAY Who? 
O'RYAN Zero. 
MACKELWAY Zero's a myth. You made him up. 
O'RYAN Myths don't kidnap little boys. Do they? 
MACKELWAY Do you? 
Sounds like O'Ryan just laughed... Then, another curve: 
O'RYAN Was she pretty? 
MACKELWAY Huh? 
O'RYAN I could hear her moaning, right under the Navajo chanting. Whole thing was downright tribal. What's she look like? 
That was unsettling. Very. Mackelway looks around feeling violated, feeling "watched." He draws the blinds. Double bolts the front door. Runs his hand under the window frame for any kind of wire tapping. 
But Mackelway won't allow himself to over-react. Not now, with O'Ryan on the phone. 
MACKELWAY (calmly) You tell me. 
O'Ryan laughs. He liked that. 
O'RYAN Fair enough. We'll stick to business: How'd ya like my old room? 
MACKELWAY Huh? 
O'RYAN "Hope House." You were there. 
How the hell did he know that? It's unsettling. 
O'RYAN (CONT'D) Dyson re-paint it? (no reply) My room. Did he re-paint it? 
MACKELWAY Yeah. White. 
O'RYAN ...But you saw what was underneath, of course. 
131   INT. MOTEL ROOM - DENTON, TEXAS - RESUMING                        131 
O'Ryan reacts. Something just changed: 
132   INT. INSIDE THE BLACK WAVE - RESUMING                             132 
The wave is rushing us forward with this speed and power of a tsunami. 
...which is when we hear the laughter of a LITTLE BOY. 
133   INT. MOTEL ROOM - DENTON, TEXAS - RESUMING                        133 
O'Ryan just heard it too. Then new images come at him - but they are, at first, GRAINY, CHOPPY... 
134   EXT. UNIDENTIFIED PLAY AREA - SAME                                134 
The sounds of that wave become fainter, receding to the background, giving way to that sound of laughter, and the squeaking of a PLAY-SET SWING. 
Like an old tv slowly gaining reception, the image takes a moment to crystallize before us. But then it sharpens: 
We're in the PLAY AREA of a TRUCK-STOP DINER, but it feels like we're looking at it through a broken lens. The images appear SPHERICAL to us, surrounded by darkness. 
Before us a 5-year old plays on a swing. Call him CHARLIE. 
135   INT. HOPE HOUSE - O'RYAN'S FORMER ROOM - RESUMING                 135 
Mackelway has scraped away more of the white paint now - enough to see the outline of the front edge of the black wave, its lip. He continues. 
136   INT. MOTEL ROOM - DENTON, TEXAS - RESUMING                        136 
O'Ryan tightens. We can't tell if he experiencing something from the past, the present, the future... 
137   EXT. PLAY-AREA - RESUMING                                         137 
We WHIP AROUND quickly, getting a look into the diner itself. There, through a window, we see a WOMAN, presumably Charlie's mother. Her name's KATHLEEN, 40. 
Kathleen has her back turned to us, because she's busy diapering her nine month-old BABY at a table. 
138   INT. MOTEL ROOM - DENTON, TEXAS - RESUMING                        138 
O'Ryan, at his desk, seems to be getting all of this. And it is agitating him. There's perspiration on his forehead. 
139   EXT. PLAY AREA - RESUMING                                      139 
The sound of that wave is still a presence. Charlie looks up at us as he swings. His smile is pure, genuine. 
We whip around for another look at Kathleen. She's still busy with that diaper. Then we look back to Charlie. 
140   INT. MOTEL ROOM - RESUMING                                     140 
O'Ryan keeps his eyes shut, his focus total... but every part of him is becoming tense. 
141   INT. HOPE HOUSE - O'RYAN'S FORMER ROOM - RESUMING              141 
Mackelway is beginning to perspire from the effort. More of that wave is visible to him. But he doesn't step back to take that in. 
142   EXT. PLAY AREA - RESUMING                                      142 
That swing is now EMPTY, dangling gently. And we're running we know not where. 
143   INT. MOTEL ROOM - RESUMING                                     143 
O'Ryan's foot starts to tap: anxiousness, discomfort. 
144   EXT. PLAY AREA - RESUMING                                      144 
We run... toward a PARKING LOT. But we do so smoothly, without effort, as if being carried by that relentless black wave. 
Then, ANOTHER SOUND bleeds in. The BANGING of the Diner's back door, which leads on to that Play Area. 
And we hear a horrified yell: 
KATHLEEN (O.S.) Charlie?! Charlie, where are you, Honey?! (fainter) Charlie?! Honey, are you out here?! 
The sound begins to break up as if on a bad radio, being taken over by the sounds of that awful WAVE... 
145   INT. HOPE HOUSE - O'RYAN'S FORMER ROOM - RESUMING              145 
Mackelway suddenly stops... as if some electric charge had just shot through him, short-circuiting him into stillness. He begins to step away from the wall. 
146   INT. MOTEL ROOM - RESUMING                                        146 
O'Ryan has lost the "pulse" - the connection that had allowed him inside what we just witnessed. 
He rises, hurrying into a tiny bathroom. We STAY ON THAT WRITING PAD, trying to decipher these lines and squiggles - the ideograms - as we hear the sounds of O'Ryan, retching. 
147   INT. HOPE HOUSE - O'RYAN'S FORMER ROOM - RESUMING                 147 
Mackelway sits on the bed, looking at what he's just uncovered. An awesome sight. His head is pounding worse than ever... so he reaches for the Vicoden. 
148   EXT. PLAY-AREA - RESUMING                                         148 
We've stepped out of that SUBJECTIVE POV now. Kathleen grabs her infant, distraught, as another massive 18-WHEEL TRUCK blows by us in the distance... 
149   INT. MOTEL ROOM - DENTON, TEXAS - RESUMING                        149 
O'Ryan washes his face, eyes his reflection in the mirror, scrutinizing himself. 
150   INT. HOPE HOUSE - O'RYAN'S FORMER ROOM - RESUMING                 150 
On the wall opposite Mackelway, that huge black wave is now entirely visible to him. Bits of chipped white paint litter the floor. 
Mackelway tosses over a few pages from O'Ryan's file. 
MACKELWAY Agents, trained to "see" distant locations using nothing but the mind. They called it Remote Viewing. 
Charlton eyes the pages without comment. 
MACKELWAY (CONT'D) Army stole it from the Soviets. The Bureau stole it from the Army - used it to track serial killers. (a beat) Experimental program. O'Ryan was the first agent they recruited. 
CHARLTON Good for him. 
MACKELWAY Voodoo, right? Pure Bullshit. (Charlton's waiting) ...except, it worked. It's how he drew this: Mackelway's referring to that DRAWING: a steamer-trunk, filled with ghastly Ziploc bags: 
MACKELWAY (CONT'D) He'd never been in that house before. He just saw what was in there - the Bureau taught him how... same one that deleted him. Same one that's trying to catch him now... Does anything about all this strike you as odd? 
Charlton studies him, a long beat, measuring him... Then: 
CHARLTON I'm going to Denton at Oh-Six-Hundred. You can take the day off. 
With that, he's gone - leaving Mackelway alone in here. Nothing to look at but that black wave... He hears Charlton, leaving the building. 
He slams another Vicoden, then hears a PHONE RING. Fuck it. He's not moving. Let Voice Mail get it. 
...until he hears the sound of a FAX coming in. 
He rises. Follow him: 
155   INT. FBI OFFICE - CUBICLES - CONTINUING                           155 
Mackelway hurries through the office, as the sound of that fax grows louder. 
156   INT. "FAX ROOM" - CONTINUING                                      156 
He enters. The fax has spun out a single sheet. No top-sheet. That's odd... 
But here's another face, another victim, with the customary HAVE YOU SEEN ME? across the top. 
A young African-American boy: "Lloyd Simms, Age 9. Ht. 4'10", Wt. 67 lbs. Last Seen: Greenville, Texas. Date of Disappearance: 10-26-99." 
That's it. One face. The transmission ends. Mackelway eyes those vitals. They mean something. Greenville... 
157   INT. FBI OFFICE - O'RYAN'S ROOM - RESUMING                        157 
He re-enters, and approaches that huge MAP. There's that wave of black pins, with the one BLUE PIN in its center; Greenville, with a "10-26" written beside it. 
Mackelway pulls out the lone blue pin, replaces it with a black one. Now the wave is complete. All black... 
CUT TO: 
158   INT. 18-WHEELER - CAB - MOVING - NIGHT                            158 
We've seen this truck before - several times in fact. It rumbles along the highway. We don't see who's driving, but we do see who's in the passenger seat: 
It's Charlie, five years-old, whose abduction we just witnessed. He sleeps fitfully. 
A MAN'S HAND can be seen, edging into frame - the DRIVER. He picks up a CASSETE, shoves it into the tape deck. 
And out comes the sound of "Barney the Dinosaur." 
BARNEY (THRU DASHBOARD STEREO) Oh silly songs get sillier/When you hear them once again/And maybe you're hearing an echo/Or maybe it's only a friend! 
The truck continues to rumble along. 
CUT TO: 
159   INT. FBI OFFICE - OUTSIDE THE O'RYAN ROOM - MORNING        159 
6 a.m. Fran pauses outside the O'Ryan Room... where Mackelway sleeps on a chair. Poor guy was here all night. 
She regards him... then her eyes find that MAP, and the gaping black wave across it. A horrible image... 
She studies Mackelway again, almost tenderly, until: 
CHARLTON (O.S.) Does he listen to you? 
She turns, startled. Here's Charlton, right behind her. And she's been caught... watching Mackelway sleep. 
FRAN I'm sorry? 
CHARLTON It's not a strength of his. I'm noticing that lately. 
Truth is, she doesn't like Charlton. Or trust him... 
FRAN He's fine. 
CHARLTON I'm not so sure. (a beat) You oughtta sit him down, remind him how a chain-of-command works. 
FRAN He's fine, Sir. 
CHARLTON Talk to him. 
With that, he's gone. Fran watches as he heads for the Front Door... and exits. 
She looks back to Mackelway. He awakens with a start. Thinking no one's watching, he pops another Vicoden. 
160   INT. O'RYAN ROOM - CONTINUING                                  160 
Fran enters, feeling slightly dirty from that exchange. Mackelway checks his watch as a few AGENTS exit the suite. 
MACKELWAY They going to Denton? 
FRAN Mmm-hmm. 
Mackelway's about to answer... when he stops himself. Just noticing something. That MORGUE PHOTO from Logan, Utah: 
There's a BURN MARK on the lower left calf of the victim. We've seen such a mark before, on another autopsy photo. 
MACKELWAY I've seen this before. 
FRAN Huh? 
He doesn't answer, just hurries to a thick BOX OF OTHER AUTOPSY FILES AND PHOTOS. Starts rifling through them... 
...until he finds the one we've seen before. The body from Trenton. He extracts it. Eyes it. A confirmation... 
He lays the two PHOTOS side by side. Looks to Fran. 
MACKELWAY Same burn-mark. (she leans in) I saw it before but it didn't register. 
Fran eyes the photos. No doubt about it - they both have the same burn mark on the lower left calf: a symmetrical, almost horizontal stripe across the flesh. 
FRAN He burns them? 
MACKELWAY I dunno. Almost looks too symmetrical to be a burn. (re: Logan victim) They're autopsying her this morning? 
FRAN Yeah. 
She gets the idea: "Find out where the hell this mark on the leg came from." Grieves enters. 
GRIEVES Fax number traces back to a Copy Center on I-30. Greenville. (Mackelway eyes his watch) I called. They don't open for another hour. 
Mackelway looks to Fran. She's not entirely sold yet... but she's getting there. 
CUT TO: 
161   INT. MACKELWAY'S YUKON - DRIVING - EARLY MORNING                   161 
Mackelway plows along I-30. 
Ahead of him, one hell of an ugly STORM-FRONT seems to be waiting. Thick, black clouds. Mackelway's driving right into the teeth of them... 
CUT TO: 
162   EXT. "FAST-COPY" - ESTABLISHING - DAY                              162 
A copy-place, right off I-30. Mackelway's Yukon is parked in front. 
163   INT. "FAST-COPY" - COUNTER - DAY                                   163 
Mackelway stands opposite a DAY-MANAGER: 30, harried, eyeing a copy of the composite drawing of O'Ryan. 
DAY-MANAGER (re: O'Ryan) Naah. I never saw that guy in here. 
MACKELWAY He sent a fax from this location 'bout seven o'clock this morning. 
DAY-MANAGER We're closed at seven. 
MACKELWAY Are your faxes programmable? Could he have paid last night to have it sent this morning? 
DAY-MANAGER Sure. But that costs extra. 
MACKELWAY Were you here last night? 
DAY-MANAGER Nope. Haven't done nights since I got promoted. 
Mackelway eyes the guy... then hears a CEL-PHONE ring. 
MACKELWAY 'Scuse me. 
Mackelway grabs his cel, backing away from the counter. 
MACKELWAY (CONT'D) (into cel) Mackelway. 
164   INTERCUT WITH/INT. MORGUE - SAME                                164 
Fran is at a phone, in the Morgue. The Logan Utah BODY lies on the table. 
FRAN It's not a burn. It's a freezer-burn. MACKELWAY You're sure. 
FRAN There's crystallization in the blood stream. The blood never clotted in the wound. It's a freezer burn... I'm having the other body shipped out - the guy from Trenton. We'll see if he's got the same thing. 
Mackelway pauses, thinking... 
MACKELWAY So... he keeps the bodies in a freezer, then buries them...? 
That was a question. He can't do any better. 
FRAN I dunno. If he kept them in a freezer they'd have marks like this all over. Wouldn't they? 
Mackelway nods - that made sense. Shit. 
The noise of the Interstate doesn't make things any easier. A huge TRUCK rumbles by. 18 wheels. 
Mackelway eyes it, absently. Then a bolt hits him: 
On the side of the truck is a trademark: "EVER-FROST." This truck is hauling ice cream. 
Things just began to click. 
MACKELWAY Thanks, Fran. 
He has hit "End" before she can reply. Heads to his Yukon. 
Fran eyes the phone: that was odd... 
He grabs his cel, dials. This truck has license plates from ten states. 
MACKELWAY (INTO CEL) This is Mackelway. I need a run down on a plate. Texas: Delta-142-Romeo-Victor- Alpha. Got that? 
He puts the cel down, but doesn't hang up. Vic just made a turn onto a VAST DIRT LOT. 
A huge BANNER overhead reads, "FOUNDERS DAY CARNIVAL!!!" 
171   EXT. CARNIVAL - PARKING LOT - CONTINUING                          171 
There are several BIG-RIGS parked here, but the vast majority of the vehicles we see are garden-variety cars and SUV's. A few pick-ups. 
There are RIDES at this carnival: Pony rides, a ferris wheel, and a huge ring of Barbeques, each fired up and cooking. Must be a thousand people in attendance today. 
Vic parks his rig. Mackelway hangs back, watching: 
Vic gets out of the rig. From here we can see that that 5-year- old BOY is still stick in his car seat, and he is still screaming and flailing. 
Vic points a stern finger at the kid as if to say, "Behave or else." Then Vic disappears into the crowded carnival. 
172   EXT. MACKELWAY - AT HIS CAR - RESUMING                            172 
He gets out of the Yukon, approaching Vic's truck. We CROSS THE LOT WITH HIM. 
He reaches Vic's truck, looks in the passenger window. There's the five year-old kid, tears streaming down his face. (We still can't tell if it's Charlie.) 
Mackelway reaches for the passenger-side door. It's locked. Of course. And he can't shoot his way in. 
He looks to the kid inside: 
MACKELWAY You okay? (Kid's a blank) Kid? You okay in there? 
The Kid doesn't respond - just seems spooked. Shit... Mackelway looks into the heart of that crowd. Vic's still visible to us, but he won't be for long. 
MACKELWAY (CONT'D) (at the Kid) I'll be back. Don't worry. 
Mackelway heads into the carnival. 
173   EXT. CARNIVAL - CONTINUING                                        173 
He begins running now, past the table where ladies are selling TICKETS for the rides and games, past the Cotton-Candy Guy. 
Running... because we just lost sight of Vic. 
Mackelway hurries through that ring of barbeques, upsetting a tray or two. Then he stops. There's the ferris wheel. Was that Vic on the other side of it? 
Mackelway takes off. 
174   EXT. FERRIS WHEEL - CONTINUING                                    174 
No Vic. But Mackelway thinks he sees the guy... heading back in the direction of the parking lot. 
He runs past the Pony rides, past a funhouse, past a popcorn machine, past those ladies selling tickets. 
175   EXT. PARKING LOT - RESUMING                                      175 
He hits a bottleneck of people at the entrance. But he bursts through, runs into the dirt parking lot, around cars and big- rigs, then turns a corner and: 
...runs smack into Benjamin O'Ryan. 
The shock is so total it takes each of them a moment to recover from it. But here he is. O'Ryan, five feet away. 
Mackelway's speechless, still trying to recalibrate himself. A second ago he was chasing a possible Zero. Now he's face to face with O'Ryan. 
And O'Ryan isn't running. In fact, he almost seems amused. 
O'RYAN Well, well... Must be quite a moment for you. Congratulations. 
Mackelway still hasn't spoken, until: 
MACKELWAY What're you doing here? 
O'RYAN Waiting for you. 
...which is when Mackelway realizes that he is standing right in front of Vic's rig. 
But he wasn't expecting what comes next: 
Vic has returned to the rig, with a WOMAN beside him. Turns out, she's his WIFE. Vic opens the passenger-side door, unclasps that five year-old kid from his seat. 
FIVE YEAR-OLD Mommy! 
The kid dives into the Woman's arms. 
WOMAN Morning, Baby! 
VIC I told you she'd be here. (to Woman) He's been a brat all morning. 
Mother hugs son... which means that Mackelway has misread things, badly. 
And O'Ryan is a witness to it - hence the grin. 
MACKELWAY (at O'Ryan) Hands up. 
O'Ryan raises his hands. Mackelway reaches for his cuffs. 
CUT TO: 
176   EXT. CARNIVAL - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER                       176 
O'Ryan's hands are cuffed in front of him. Mackelway leads him to the Yukon, opens a door for him, and puts him into the backseat. A few LOOKIE-LOU'S strain for a peek. 
MACKELWAY Drive. 
He accidentally burns himself on the super-heated chain. 
MACKELWAY (CONT'D) (re: burn) Fuck! 
Cuffs are unlocked now. O'Ryan starts up the Yukon. 
197   EXT. GREENVILLE STREETS - DRIVING - CONTINUING                    197 
O'Ryan drives, pursuing the big-rig. Mackelway gets on his cel- phone, dials. Rain falls in SHEETS all around them. 
MACKELWAY (INTO CEL-PHONE) (urgently) This is Mackelway! I'm travelling north on... Grove Road, approaching I-30 in Greenville. Request immediate back-up. Pursuing a suspect in a refrigerated truck, Texas license plate Alpha-- 
The Yukon swerves hard to the right, narrowly avoiding the tail end of Zero's rig as he swings it into our path. Mackelway drops the phone. Grabs it again. 
MACKELWAY (PHONE, CONT'D) Alpha-4-5-2-Tango-Foxtrot-Alpha. 
Zero does it again - swinging the rear of his rig across the road, forcing O'Ryan to swerve hard. The Yukon gets shoved on to a curb, then clunks down to the street again. 
Then Zero jams on the brakes. Mackelway's eyes go wide. 
MACKELWAY (CONT'D) (at O'Ryan) Brakes! 
O'Ryan jumps on the brakes. The Yukon screeches to a stop, throwing itself into a sideways slide. It bangs, passenger side first, into the rear of the truck, breaking a window. 
Mackelway ducks out of the way of breaking glass. Then the rig pulls away again. O'Ryan follows. 
198   THE CHASE - CONTINUING                                            198 
Zero's rig turns hard onto a SERVICE ROAD, running parallel to the Interstate. Mackelway is locked in on that truck. 
MACKELWAY (CONT'D) (into cel-phone again) Travelling due west now. Don't see a name. It's a service road, running parallel to the-- 
Then Mackelway freezes, mid-word. He just saw something that made his jaw drop: 
On the other side of this road is a field of TALL WHEAT. 
Time seems to stop. His blood feels like it just congealed. Tall wheat in a wet wind. He has been here before. He has seen it before. 
And so has O'Ryan... 
Mackelway just stares, slack-jawed, as that wheat whips past them. The feeling is so unsettling that for a moment he forgets about Zero, and the rig, and the kid... 
Everything has just crystallized in a horrible way. He knows that he is going to wind up in that wheat field, somehow, with O'Ryan. 
And O'Ryan will be begging him for mercy. "Please..." 
O'Ryan guns the Yukon, attempting to cut in front of the rig. Zero swings wide, sending the Yukon into a curb this time. That shreds their front tire. 
...which means that in one minute this car is going to be undriveable. So if they don't stop Zero from hitting that Interstate - now - Zero will be gone. 
MACKELWAY (CONT'D) (absently) What're you... 
O'RYAN Can't let him hit the Interstate. 
Mackelway braces himself, as O'Ryan guns his car up the left side of the rig, shredded tire and all. Then: 
He pulls right in front of the rig. At about 60 m.p.h. And he jams on the brakes. 
Zero swerves, out of instinct. It throws the rig into a vicious JACK-KNIFE. The van whips around in front of the cab, swatting the Yukon away like a fly. 
We're inside the Yukon as it rolls, Mackelway and O'Ryan look like tinker toys. 
The torque pulls Zero's rig onto its side, sliding hard. Metal hits concrete, sending up a shower of SPARKS. 
The Yukon winds up in a ditch alongside the service road, upside down. Mackelway, alive and awake, strains to look out the busted windshield. 
What he sees is hard to discern - but it looks like Zero's rig is lying flat on its side. 
And, of course, he is mere yards from that wheat field... 
199   EXT. SERVICE ROAD - CONTINUING                                 199 
The rig's cab lies driver's-side down. But the passenger-side door pops open. And Zero pokes through it, his eyes immediately scanning that TALL WHEAT. Rain pours. 
Mackelway's watching. O'Ryan, who blacked out for a second now opens his eyes, getting the picture in a hurry. 
Zero leaps to the ground, rolls, and rises. Only thing in his hand is a TIRE IRON. Carrying it, he sprints into the wheat field - vanishing. 
Mackelway bursts out of the Yukon, in pursuit. O'Ryan's door is stuck. Mackelway doesn't stop to help him - just barrels across the street. 
Just then - a STATE RANGER CAR arrives. 
MACKELWAY (over his shoulder, running) Get the van open! He's got a kid in the van! 
STATE RANGER hurries out of his squad car. Mackelway sprints into the tall wheat. 
O'Ryan, with a grunt, gets his door open. Now he too disappears into that Wheat Field. 
200   EXT. WHEAT FIELD - CONTINUING                                     200 
Tall wheat in a stiff wet wind, and not a drop of moonlight to guide us. Mackelway plunges in, gun drawn. No idea where he's going. 
...except he's been here before. He's seen it. And there is a feeling of inevitability to all this; it's haunting. 
He's practically blind in here. Can't see five feet in front of him. Nothing but the sound of his own breathing. 
That, too, was presaged. Those visions... 
201   EXT. ZERO'S TOPPLED RIG - CONTINUING                              201 
...and hands him the gun. Just like that. 
Mackelway eyes it. O'Ryan doesn't say a word, just crosses back to Zero, and grabs that TIRE-IRON off the ground. 
O'Ryan's now standing right behind Zero, as: 
O'RYAN (at Mackelway) You have to understand: none of this was arbitrary. We were chosen, you and I. WHAP! O'Ryan just swung that tire-iron into Zero's rib cage. We hear bones crack, and air rushing from the guy's lungs. He drops to his knees, gasping. 
O'RYAN (CONT'D) I saw us here. You did too. THUMP! Another violent swing of that tire-iron, busting up the other side of Zero's torso. Now both sides of his rib-cage have shattered. Breathing is almost impossible. 
Mackelway tightens. His head just began to throb... 
MACKELWAY Okay. You made your point. 
O'RYAN Bullshit! If I'd made my fucking point you would've shot him yourself by now! 
Another swing of that tire-iron, across the back of Zero's neck. He crumbles, face down. 
Fuck it. Mackelway crosses to O'Ryan and puts that gun right up against the back of O'Ryan's head. 
MACKELWAY Enough! 
Then, an odd thing... O'Ryan simply smiles. 
Something about having that gun pointed right at him - it's a relief. 
MACKELWAY (CONT'D) Drop it. 
O'RYAN Or what? 
MACKELWAY Just drop it. 
O'RYAN Would you shoot me? 
That's something Mackelway doesn't want to consider. 
MACKELWAY Put it down. 
O'RYAN (calmly) I want you to think for a second. About your destiny. Who you are. You're cursed, like I am - except you keep running from it. (Mackelway's silent) You hear things. You see things. That's why you can't sleep, why your head always aches. 
He turns. They are face to face. Nothing but that gun between them. 
O'RYAN (CONT'D) ...and it's why you are going to let me kill this animal. And then you're going to kill me. 
That threw Mackelway badly. O'Ryan seizes the moment - wheeling around... 
He takes one last swing at Zero, like a lumberjack. The tire- iron impacts Zero's skull with a dull THUD, cracking it. He is dead. 
Mackelway's eyes go wide. Whole thing has been a blur. 
O'Ryan releases the tire-iron... and drops to his knees like a man awaiting execution, his back to Mackelway. 
Mackelway is silent. Stunned. The blood from Zero's caved-in skull finds its way to O'Ryan's knees. 
But O'Ryan remains peaceful. Calm. Ready. 
MACKELWAY Get up. 
O'RYAN I can't do that, Mack. I've seen all this already. For months now. 
MACKELWAY Get up. 
O'RYAN Every time, we're in this field: same wind, same rain. And you... 
He puts a finger to his head, pretending it's a gun. Then he pretends to pull the trigger. Mackelway gets the idea. 
O'RYAN (CONT'D) It's okay. I want you to. I'm begging you to. 
Mackelway doesn't know what to do. Then, making matters worse: 
FRAN (O.S.) (aloud) Mack? 
She's about a hundred yards away... but she'll be here soon enough. That puts some heat under O'Ryan: 
O'RYAN I'm tired, Mack. 
FRAN (O.S.) Can you hear me? 
She's 90 yards out now... 
O'RYAN Pull the trigger... (no reply) I'm not going to jail. Now pull the fucking trigger! 
Mackelway's frozen. O'Ryan knows it. 
O'RYAN (CONT'D) Fucking coward. 
O'Ryan rises now, facing Mackelway. 
O'RYAN (CONT'D) Some things are not up to us to decide. They just exist. They're inevitable. This field. This rain. This moment. It has all already happened. You know that. You've seen it too. 
He shoves Mackelway in the chest. 
FRAN (O.S.) Mack? 
She's 70 yards out now... 
O'RYAN Shut it off for me. 
MACKELWAY I'm not going to kill you, O'Ryan. 
O'RYAN Of course you will. I've seen it.

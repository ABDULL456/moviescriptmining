FADE IN: 
EXT. MIAMI STREET - MOVEMENT - NIGHT (1964) 
in the dark. Coming toward us. Up and down in sync to an INSTRUMENTAL LEAD-IN from somewhere. A slip of light. A glimpse of somebody in shadow under a sweatshirt hood, staring at us, in and out of the dark as... 
INT. THE STAGE, HAMPTON HOUSE CLUB - EMPTY FRAME - NIGHT 
A man walks into the shot, grabs a microphone, slips out of his jacket and looks at us. He wants to tell us something. He's in a lavender light. This is SAM COOKE. What he calls out...a throaty mixture of gospel, soul and sex...is "Let me hear it!" And WOMEN SHRIEK. He says, "Yeah!" They answer, shrieking, "Oh, yeah!"... 
EXT. MIAMI STREET - HOODED MAN'S FACE - NIGHT 
up and down, running along a dark road in the dead of night, passing vacant lots with debris amid trees and faded buildings. He is CASSIUS CLAY. He runs in construction boots. His eyes stare from under the hood. He passes the husk of an abandoned car, a pastel storefront. We're in Overtown, Miami's inner-city black neighborhood. 
INT. THE STAGE, HAMPTON HOUSE CLUB (MIAMI) - SAM COOKE 
shouts, "Don't fight it! We gonna feel it!"     The women in the audience answer: "Gotta feel it!" 
EXT. MIAMI STREET - CASSIUS - NIGHT 
now runs diagonally across NW 7th INTERCUT with Cooke shouting, "Yeah!" EXT. MACARTHUR CAUSEWAY - CASSIUS - NIGHT 
SAM COOKE'S AUDIENCE (O.S.) Oh, yeah! 
Cassius runs toward us. Off to the side in the black- mirrored water of Biscayne Bay, leaden clouds in a black sky. And now Sam Cooke SINGS "...because you make me wanna mooove...!" and breaks into the first verse of "Feel It." But we see Cassius' eyes are FOCUSED, CONCENTRATED, ELSEWHERE. To where is this man running? Why is his expression so distant? A WHITE LIGHT suddenly hits him from behind. He looks over at... 
WIDE FROM THE FRONT:      CASSIUS + A METRO-DADE POLICE CAR 
that's slowed, clocking the suspicious, running black man. The driver starts to pull over, to hassle Cassius. Then, the cop riding shotgun gets a radio call. He taps the driver's shoulder. They take off, the driver laughing. Cassius looks after the white cops. He is neither relieved nor angry. He's dismissive. And, instead, he sees something else... 
INT. A BOARD ROOM - GORDON DAVIDSON - DAY 
and six other patrician, white business-people of Louisville in their green baize and wood-paneled Luxo boardroom. They speak soundlessly and patronizingly to Cassius Clay, Sr., seated at the foot of the table. It relates to the stack of contracts in front of him. He is in a suit and tie, his hair and moustache are dapper. His tie's a little loud. He has his hands folded deferentially in front of him. 
LSG BOARD MEMBER (reading) "...the successor trustee shall be fully authorized to pay or disperse such sums from the income or principal as may be required." (beat) Do you understand so far, Mr. Clay? 
CASSIUS CLAY, SR. Uh, yes, I do. 
We get the impression that, if he doesn't understand what he's being told, he's faking it. He is conforming, delivering socially mandated deference... 
FRONTAL:   CASSIUS, SR. 
and BEYOND HIM, seated against the wall, is Cassius, Jr. in sport jacket and tie. Right now he looks to his left and to the right, and only then do we notice the entire wall he's against is covered with pictures of thoroughbreds and studs this Louisville Sponsoring Group owns as well. He is one among their sporting possessions. He doesn't like it. He looks at the back of his father listening. 
LSG BOARD MEMBER Are you sure, sir? 
CASSIUS CLAY, SR. Yeah.   I follow you. 
LSG BOARD MEMBER Okay. 'Cause I'd be happy to explain any of these terms. 
CASSIUS CLAY, SR. No, thank you. 
LSG BOARD MEMBER Thank you, sir. 
EXT. MACARTHUR CAUSEWAY - CLOSER:   CASSIUS' EYES - NIGHT 
back here, now, crossing through black night and over black water of the MacArthur Causeway. We start to HEAR pop pop pop pop pop pop POP over Sam Cooke's music, and Sam Cooke's image SUPERIMPOSES as he segues from "Feelin'" to "Bring It On Home." And the pop pop pop pop pop carries us into... 
INT. THE FIFTH STREET GYM, (MIAMI) - SPEED BAG - DAWN 
Cassius' fists fly in a reeling motion, hitting the speed bag. But it's his eyes that arrest us...focused, concentrated. 
OVER CASSIUS' SHOULDER:   BROWN SPEED BAG 
is a blur. And it SLOWS and becomes a brown boxing glove driving in a SLOWED straight line right at us like a piston. OVER the glove, pushing the fist at us is SONNY LISTON. The brown glove hits... 
INT. RING - A BOXER (N.D. BOXER) 
in a linear left jab. These punches are watched by Cassius' eyes in the Fifth Street Gym...studiously studying Liston's feet...straight-line movement...the jab, linear and straight at us. But it SLAMS into the Boxer, not Cassius. Down he goes. He's out. The referee pulls out his mouthpiece. It's a bloody mess. Teeth have been knocked out with it, so devastating is Sonny Liston... A distant crowd ROARS. 
INT. RING - CASSIUS - NIGHT 
VERY CLOSE, climbs into the crush with other contenders. Victorious, Liston, being escorted out, passes very close to him on purpose to say... 
SONNY LISTON (whispers; low) Gonna fuck you up. Gonna beat you like I's your daddy... 
To Cassius, boxing is dangerous athletics, but Liston's malevolence is straight from the street. 
INT. FIFTH STREET GYM - CASSIUS' EYES 
SEE... 
A MAN (reading) ...210... Cassius Clay weighs 210 pounds. 
CASSIUS (changes down) You sure you got that right...? 
The man nods. Cassius gets off, is pulled aside. And Liston gets on: unremitting stare of death at Cassius... 
THE MAN 218. Sonny Liston...the heavyweight champion of the world weighs 218 pounds... 
BUNDINI Pounds of what?! 
And Cassius goes off again... 
CASSIUS Pounds of ugly! He so ugly, sweat run backwards off his forehead to get away from his face! C'mon, bear! I turn you into a rug!! Rumble right now, man! 
He's restrained by Angelo and Bundini. 
SONNY LISTON (low) Keep talkin', punk-ass faggot! I'll fuck you up like I's your daddy... 
Handlers break it up and hustle Liston out of there. 
CASSIUS You whup me, I'll crawl out of the ring on my knees and catch the next jet plane out of the country. 
JIMMY CANNON (older reporter) That a promise? 
Laughter. 
CASSIUS (to Jimmy Cannon) ...you be the first eatin' his words! 
A Doctor claps a cuff around Cassius' arm, taking blood pressure. 
THE DOCTOR (alarmed, to Pacheco) 210 over 110?! I can't let him in the ring in this condition! 
REPORTERS (shout) Liston says he'll talk with his fists. "Lip from Louisville." (laughter) ...odds 7:1 against you. Big bet's whether he'll knock you out in the first round or third round or kill you altogether. You scared of him? 
CASSIUS I'm scared of no man. I give Sonny Liston talking lessons, boxing lessons and falling down lessons. 
CANNON/OTHERS Yeah, sure. Are you a Black Muslim? Pat Putnam in the Miami Herald said... 
CASSIUS "Black Muslim"'s a press word... 
Dundee's defensive, fast... 
ANGELO DUNDEE Man's religion's his own business. What kinda question's that? 
REPORTERS/HOWARD COSELL Does he hate white people? Malcolm X was in town. Then he left. Was that so he wouldn't embarrass you? Liston cannot stand you... 
ANGELO DUNDEE (sees) Howard! 
HOWARD COSELL ...cannot stand you, Cassius.   He really wants to kill you... 
HOWARD COSELL is balding, tall, forties, lugging a tape recorder. 
CASSIUS Howard Cosell, you are an instigator! (Cosell smiles) How you get that way? When I'm done with Liston, I'm comin' for you! 
Dundee uses that to end the conference before it strays into "Black Muslim" territory. Meanwhile on the way out... 
DOCTOR (to Pacheco) It doesn't come down, I cancel this fight. You call me in an hour with his blood pressure. 
EXT./INT. MIAMI RENTAL HOUSE - DR. PACHECO - DAY 
past guards, Bundini, press, starts to enter. Inside, Clay's on the sofa, in his underwear, watching "The Man With the X-Ray Eyes," who has the power to imbue and control from beams emitted from his eyes. Dundee and Bingham hang out. 
Cassius' mind is elsewhere. His eyes float to the corner of the doorway before we see Pacheco, even though from the outside, has started to enter... 
EXT. CASSIUS' RENTAL HOUSE, BACKYARD - CORNER OF HOUSE - DAY (MIAMI) 
Nothing. Cassius is asleep in a lounge chair...incongruously a TV is run from the house by an extension cord. Cassius wakes. His eyes say, "Who are you?" 
BUNDINI (entering) I'm called Bundini, rhymes with Houdini. He was a Jew, too...some other people call me Fastblack...or Daddy Mac... 
Drew "Bundini" Brown, early forties, holds a hat in his hand, his eyes always seem to be glistening, ready to rage, laugh or cry, tentatively approaches. Cassius' flat eyes return to the television. 
BUNDINI (CONT'D) (motions at lounge chair) Shorty sent me to Sugar Ray Robinson. I gave my power to Sugar Ray for seven years, gave him my voodoo, my magic. Now Shorty sent me to you. 
CASSIUS Who Shorty? 
BUNDINI I call him Shorty 'cause he like 'em circumcised. Original people. Like Moses. And I was a babe in a basket, too. I was born on a doorstep with a note 'cross my chest that read, "Do the best you can for him, world." I had to suck the first nipple come along. I didn't run away from home...I been runnin' to home. 
Cassius should kick him out, but Bundini's got his foot in the door of Cassius' attention. 
BUNDINI (CONT'D) (beat, and his raison d'Ãªtre) Now, I gotta ask you. You fixin' them fights? Else no way you could tell great Archie Moore what round you droppin' him in...all of them predictions you make, comin' true. Never heard of nobody predictin' the round like you. You either a phony or Shorty's in your corner. Tell me the truth, young man... 
Cassius, stretched out, mumbles without looking at him... 
CASSIUS ...I study every fight. 'Til I got a plan. Wear him down two through four. Drop him in the fifth round. So the p'diction ain't a p'diction. It's a plan. And 'cause of all the poppin' off I do, I know I gotta win! That's the truth. And why I'm tellin' you? 
BUNDINI 'Cause I'm gonna be your Inspiration. Your motivator. In your corner. Can I be in your corner, young man? 
CASSIUS (thinks, then) Yeah... 
BUNDINI (inexplicably moved, covers) Ain't spent much time in Miami. Where the water? 
Cassius has drifted off, back to watching TV.    What he sees as his eyes close is: 
Liston's getting a lot of strident advice.        THE BELL. 
INT. RING, ROUND THREE 
LISTON'S LEFT 
comes in like a freight train. Cassius merely leans away to avoid Liston, circles and now snaps off a flurry and OPENS A CUT UNDER SONNY'S LEFT EYE. Then, he splits out of there. 
ANNOUNCER (at ringside, on radio) He's opened a cut on Liston. Liston's never been cut! 
And Cassius, seizing opportunity, hits Liston with more combinations. If Cassius won Round One, probably but not certainly won Round Two, he now demonstrates he OWNS Round Three. It's a symphony of classical Cassius Clay footwork, flicked jabs that confuse, and, then, hard-hitting combinations that rock the presumably immovable Liston. No one told Sonny that Cassius could hit. And, at 210 pounds, he hits HARD. Liston, angered, panicked, knows he's losing and goes after Cassius and misses wildly as the BELL ends Round Three... 
INT. CLAY'S CORNER - CLAY 
stands a moment before he sits. 
EXTREMELY CLOSE:   CASSIUS CLAY 
breathing heavily, ignoring the stool and Dundee and Bundini, looks around. THIS IS WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE 22, TO BE CASSIUS CLAY, TO BE ON TOP OF YOUR GAME AND TO BE ABOUT TO OWN THE WORLD. He looks over the crowd. Only then, turns and sits... 
CASSIUS (to Dundee) He's nothin' to me... 
The genius of Cassius... 
CASSIUS (CONT'D) And he knows it... 
INT. LISTON'S CORNER - CORNERMAN 
slips a vial of some medicant from his pocket and rubs it into Liston's shoulder. 
INT. RING - ROUND FOUR 
The BELL RINGS. Clay peppers Liston with jabs.    Liston pokes his left at Cassius, trying to reach him.   They feint, 
circle. Liston gets his left into Cassius' face.    It's more a poke than a shot. 
CLOSE:   CASSIUS 
blinks back something...we're not sure what. It seems to go away. Then it's back. The fight continues... 
WIDER:   CASSIUS 
dominating. They clinch. They break. This time Cassius violently blinks his eyes! Something's wrong! 
CASSIUS ...my eyes! 
A knife-like pain. He can't see.     He's getting beaten up. He's in trouble. The BELL. 
INT. RING, CASSIUS' CORNER - CASSIUS 
sits. 
CASSIUS (shouting) My eyes! I can't see...somethin' in my eyes! 
Dundee feverishly washes water to get the irritant out of Cassius' eyes. 
INT. ARENA 
A buzzer sounds, warning the bell's coming for Round Five. Now Cassius stands, saying... 
CASSIUS (his gloves) Cut 'em off! Cut 'em!   I'm blind. 
The BELL.    Dundee's still in the ring. 
ANGELO DUNDEE No. You quit, it's over! Get out there. Be a yardstick. This is the big one, daddy. Get out there and run! 
He literally pushes Cassius into the ring. 
INT. RING - ROUND FIVE - LISTON 
rushes Clay. He knows this is his chance. Cassius tries to tie Liston up by holding onto the back of his neck, but 
Liston pounds left and right hooks. If anybody wondered if Clay could take punishment, this answers that. WHAM-WHAM- WHAM-WHAM-WHAM...five huge hooks. 
Liston is desperate to end it while Cassius is in trouble. Haymaker after haymaker; some connect, others are blocked but knock Clay sideways. Clay, still blind, keeps backing and dancing. 
CLOSER:   CASSIUS' EYES 
With a minute left, now, he sees better. Liston throws him into a corner, still trying to put him away. But, he can't, and Liston's energy seems to deflate once he knows that. The BELL. 
INT. RING, CASSIUS' CORNER - CASSIUS' 
eyes are clear.   In 60 seconds he recovers his energy.    He's ready. BELL. 
INT. RING - ROUND SIX - CASSIUS 
can't wait to get out. He shuffles. He circles. He fires combinations. In the early rounds, provoked by Cassius, Liston's anger caused him to abandon his fight plan. Now, having been proven futile, Liston's confidence is gone. He's left with nothing. Psychologically and athletically, Liston is defeated. The BELL. Liston's eyes contemplate the inevitable: face nine more rounds of this. 
INT. RING, CASSIUS' CORNER - BETWEEN ROUNDS - AS CASSIUS 
waits for the seventh-round bell. 
HOWARD COSELL (doing color radio commentary with Les Kelter's blow-by-blow) ...Clay, a round ago, looked like he'd about had it, but in round six... 
And Cassius drops it on them... CASSIUS And I'm not Clay. Clay's the name of the people who owned by ancestors. I don't want to be called after that slave name no more. So I'm "X." Cassius X. And I'm a member of the Nation of Islam. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad is my spiritual guide. Malcolm X is my mentor. 
This is hard news! 
REPORTERS (all at once) You a card-carrying member?    Aren't Black Muslims a hate group? 
CASSIUS (droll) "Card-carrying"...? Don't need no "card." You got a Christian card? 750 million people believe in Islam. I'm one of them. 
ANOTHER REPORTER (O.S.) Minister Malcolm...what about the reports of a split between you and Elijah Muhammad? 
JOSEPH 13X:   we read his face listening to Malcolm. 
MALCOLM X This is the champ's time. And I'm here as a friend to celebrate his victory. So I got nothing you want... 
CASSIUS I'm going to be a people's champion. But I don't have to be the way you want me to be. I'm gonna be what I want. And I'm free to think any way I want... 
And, as he goes on, the crowd knows neither Cassius nor Malcolm will ever turn their backs on them. 
EXT. THE HOTEL THERESA - MALCOLM - NIGHT 
enters into the street with his Bodyguard and looks up to a top-floor window in which he sees a light is still on at 4 a.m. 
INT. THE HOTEL THERESA, CASSIUS' ROOM - CASSIUS - BEFORE DAWN 
asleep with the television on. There's a knock on the door. Barely awake, he gets up to answer it. It's Malcolm. Still in his familiar hat and overcoat. He hasn't slept... 
MALCOLM X I was leaving, saw the light on...how come you're up? 
CASSIUS (mumbles, half-asleep) ...watchin' a show on termites...they knockin' down this house, here. 
He goes back to lay on the bed. Malcolm looks out the window...the wet streets at night. 
MALCOLM X I been invited to speak at Ibadan University in Nigeria. C'mon with me? 
CASSIUS Six million in your house and you don't know it. Where? 
MALCOLM X Africa.   You been there? 
CASSIUS Africa? No. Only Rome.      Yeah, man, let's go! 
MALCOLM X Nkrumah stayed with me when he was a student in New York, so we'll stop in Ghana... 
CASSIUS When we leaving? 
MALCOLM X Next Thursday. 
Malcolm's distracted.   He fingers his glasses. 
CASSIUS (sees) What is it? 
MALCOLM X You ever been so angry...have you ever been so angry that you'd explode? 
CASSIUS (after a beat) Tore out a picture of Emmett Till when I was little. Couldn't take my eyes to it...couldn't look at it. Barb-wire around his neck to a 75- pound cotton-gin fan. Took out his eye. The cruelty to it...I couldn't look at it...couldn't throw it away. 
MALCOLM X What else? 
CASSIUS I thought, "What I do wrong to be so low that people could do that to people like me?" It made me feel ashamed. And that makes no sense. But that's what it was. 
MALCOLM X ...when I heard about the four girls bombed in the 16th Street Church in Birmingham? (beat) The prohibitions of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad prevented me from speaking my voice in action. Because Birmingham was part of the civil rights movement, begging for a place at the white man's table... But dead children...are dead children. So the anger I felt, I had to contain. I locked that down! So tight my muscles seized. I lost control over the right side of my body. Leg didn't work...right arm didn't work. "I'm having a stroke," I thought. I had to hold it in 'cause I wanted, all I wanted was to BREAK SOMETHING! Break a part...any part of this system. Because you are so provoked as a human being. In your spirit. In your heart... At the death of children. But I COULD DO...nothing. 
Cassius is quiet. 
MALCOLM X (CONT'D) (putting his glasses back on) Everyone knows... Now I'm advocating more direct political action involvement with the international struggle... So Elijah Muhammad has suspended me as a Minister in the Nation of Islam for 90 days. 
CASSIUS You can fix that... 
MALCOLM X I don't know. I will try when we get back. Until then I will live each day as if I am already dead. 
That statement surprises Cassius, but he says nothing. Malcolm X stands by the window and watches the day begin in Harlem. 
INT. ELIJAH MUHAMMAD'S HOUSE, CHICAGO, 1964 - JOSEPH 13X - DAY 
approaches Cassius in a suit and tie and beckons him into a living room in which sits Elijah Muhammad on a plastic- covered white sofa. Cassius is at his most deferential, awed at being in this man's presence. Elijah's power is the inverse of his size. He's short and delicate-featured. He motions for Cassius to sit beside him. Joseph 13X sits across the room with two men. 
ELIJAH MUHAMMAD Only after long service and high merit in the spiritual and physical rebirth of Afro-American people...is one granted an original name. But you are special. A world champion. So there is a gift I wish to give you. From this day forward you will be known as Muhammad Ali...which means "one worthy of praise," and Ali means "most high." 
CASSIUS (a beat, sounding it) Muhammad Ali. (humble) "Worthy of praise..." Thank you! 
And he's genuinely moved. As Elijah Muhammad puts his small hands in Muhammad Ali's hands...giving him his blessings... 
ELIJAH MUHAMMAD (cautioning) Be very careful what you say...your words reflect on the nation of Islam, now. 
CASSIUS Yes, sir. 
ELIJAH MUHAMMAD (after a beat) Up until now, I have entrusted your spiritual development to Brother Malcolm. (beat) I do not feel this is a wise course anymore. 
Extremely emotional about Malcolm, tears come to Elijah Muhammad's eyes. Joseph 13X observes in the background. Cassius is taken by surprise at "The Messenger"'s display... 
ELIJAH MUHAMMAD (CONT'D) Malcolm has gone off into the secular world and does not measure his words. I have decided to give you, as your guide, my very own son, Herbert Muhammad. 
And he looks across the room...a roly-poly man wearing a bow tie...HERBERT MUHAMMAD. He has a habit of nervously straightening his shirt. A seemingly mild, pleasant man, he is without self-definition. Below this avuncular surface, he defines himself by quietly desiring and acquiring what is others'. 
ELIJAH MUHAMMAD (CONT'D) Herbert will supervise all of your spiritual and material needs. 
Betty has come in.   They exchange a look. 
BETTY SHABAZZ (concerned for her husband) Malcolm? 
MALCOLM X (after a beat, disconsolate) Cassius won't be coming to Africa...not with me. 
She puts her hand on Malcolm's shoulder. 
BETTY SHABAZZ Go anyway. Don't put it off.      It's not safe here. ONE OF HIS CHILDREN (OVER) (calling) Mommy...the bath's ready... 
CUT TO: 
INT. GHANA AIR DC-8 COCKPIT - ALI - NIGHT 
in first class on a "Ghana Airlines" flight to Africa. Close by is Herbert Muhammad. Howard Bingham and Ali's brother, Rudy, are across the aisle from him, asleep...   The plane bumps in choppy air. 
Muhammad, unable to sleep, a nervous flyer, gets up. He wanders up the aisle to the front of the plane. A Stewardess comes out of the cockpit. Muhammad slows, startled by the pilots. Both pilot and copilot are black. 
ALI (joking) Hey, man, where they put the real pilot? What you doin' up here? 
PILOT (not understanding; British accent) I am...the pilot. He's the copilot... (moves map case) Here, Mr. Clay, sit down... 
ALI No, man, I meant...in L'ville, when I growed up, they barely let black folks drive buses. 
Ali looks out the window...a new day downs over the land. Then Bingham shows up over Ali's shoulder. They all pose, facing the rear of the cockpit. Then, the Pilot points to the coast below them and the sunrise... 
THE PILOT Here we are. Cote d'Ivoire...Africa. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. BUILDING IN CAIRO - CABLE - DAY (EGYPT) 
snakes out a building.   CAM FOLLOWS IT and we HEAR... 
BETTY SHABAZZ (V.O.) We should think of a name, Malcolm... INT. CAIRO BUILDING - WIDE:   HALLWAY - DAY 
MARLIN THOMAS -- paunchy, grey, late 40's -- walks up the stairs carrying take-out food. 
MALCOLM X (V.O.) How about Gamilah or Khalilah? 
INT. CAIRO EMPTY APARTMENT - MARLIN THOMAS - DAY 
crosses to ANOTHER AMERICAN wearing headphones in the glassed-in balcony where the CABLE connects to a portable tape-recorder. 
MARLIN THOMAS (eating) Anything? 
THE MAN ...on the phone with his wife. She's having a hard time sleeping...baby's kicking a lot... 
MARLIN THOMAS Motor Pool, here, have a Chevy parts catalogue...? 
As the CIA monitors Malcolm X... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. INDEPENDENCE SQUARE, ACCRA - ALI - DAY (GHANA) 
in a Mercedes convertible. It's a monumental expression of the force for the independence of black Africa. Accra is a wonder to Ali. A Third World showplace, in 1964 Ghana is alive with the optimism of emerging Africa. Infrastructure 
and real estate are well-managed. Under Nkrumah, the city is in a frenzy of building public housing... 
ALI 
in the three-car caravan, passes the huge triumphal arch with its giant black star on the top. Thousands line the route to see the heavyweight champion and cheer him. For Ali it's another kind of parade... 
ALI'S POV:   GHANAIANS 
They're stockbrokers and street cleaners, salesmen and secretaries, hotel managers and military officers... All is a contrast to the de facto apartheid of the middle America of Ali's experience. They all cheer his caravan as it passes. CUT TO: 
EXT. THE AMBASSADOR HOTEL, ACCRA - MERCEDES - LATE AFTERNOON (GHANA) 
arrives with Ali and entourage. It's a modern hotel. Meanwhile, a different group are about to depart in limos. One among them, a tall Man in a dashiki and sunglasses and carrying a walking stick, separates. He sees Ali. So does the woman next to him. She is the poet Maya Angelou. 
MALCOLM X (shouts) Brother Muhammad... 
Taking off his shades, we realize it's Malcolm X. He wears a goatee, now. Ali turns, sees him. Total surprise. 
ALI Hey, man!!! 
They embrace. Ali greets him like the old friend he is. Maya and the Chinese diplomat wait a few steps removed. 
ALI (CONT'D) How you doin'? What's up, brother? I knew you were here...didn't think you were still here... 
MALCOLM X And I heard you were coming. 
ALI We just got here now... (words rush out) And, maaan, the brothers were flyin' a DC 8. Flippin' switches, navigatin', filing flight plans, talkin' French... 
And they remember how much they like each other. 
ALI (CONT'D) Where you goin'? 
MALCOLM X When...uh, Liberia.   When you fighting Liston? ALI November. 
MALCOLM X This is Maya Angelou and Ambassador Huang Ha. Amando Gonzalez is from Cuba. Taher Kaid is the Ambassador from Algeria. 
SONJI My father named me after Sonja Henie. 
ALI What's your father do? 
SONJI He was shot in a poker game when I was two. He don't do nothin'. Sonja, on the other hand, was an ice skater, and my mother died when I was eleven. 
ALI So who raised you? 
SONJI Godparents, but I been on my own, doing my own thing... 
ALI Whatcha doin' tomorrow?       Go ridin' with me. 
SONJI No.   I gotta work, you know. 
ALI I square it with Herbert.       I got a record player in my car. 
SONJI A record player?     C'mon.    How come it don't skip? 
ALI Got springs and stuff. 
SONJI Herbert said you met The Beatles. 
ALI Yeah. Only one of 'em's smart...the one with the glasses. 
SONJI ...he's my favorite. 
ALI People all screaming and fainting. I asked him, "This the way they act when you get big?" 
SONJI What he say? 
ALI He said, "Champ. The more real you get, the more unreal it gonna get." 
SONJI Wow... 
After Sheri sings the first chorus... 
ALI Let's go... 
SONJI Yeah... 
ALI (crossing out) Where you live? 
SONJI I'm takin' you there... 
Herbert looks up from his booth, starts to ask where they're going...but they're gone. He turns back to the man he's talking to... 
INT. SONJI'S APARTMENT - WINDOW - NIGHT (1964) 
PULL BACK from being above Chicago in the winter at night to Ali and Sonji making love where Sheri's voice sings the second verse. To Ali's reactions... 
ALI I think I gonna keep you around forever, girl. 
SONJI (laughs) Well, I'm not too busy right now, so...I'll think on it. 
ALI Herbert said you weren't a Muslim. 
SONJI Cover my hair? No make-up?     Long dresses? Honey, please. (beat) Were you a virgin? 
ALI Why? 
SONJI (laughs) 'Cause you so "gone" off a little good time. 
ALI I'm no virgin...but I may as well be. (beat) I ain't jokin'! I always know when I know. See this face? I mean, you got a pretty face for a girl's face, but you ever seen somethin' as pretty as me? Now, you about five-foot-three...that's too small. But I overlook that, too, 'cause... 
SONJI (sarcastic) Thank you so much. 
ALI ...'cause of your spirit! 
SONJI My "spirit"...? 
ALI Yeah.   'Cause you too much fun! 
SONJI You serious? 
She raises his head next to hers, looks in his eyes. 
ALI But you gotta be a Muslim. 
SONJI Huh? How you do that? Step over a broom...shazaam...you a Muslim? 
She laughs. He rests his head on her stomach.   He likes her irreverence... 
ALI Maaan, I ain't never been with a girl like you. 
SONJI Baby, maybe you ain't ever gonna be with any other. 
They start making love again. 
EXT./INT. 50TH ON THE LAKE MOTEL, COFFEE SHOP - ALI, HERBERT, BUNDINI + BINGHAM - DAY 
HERBERT What? 
ALI That's right.   I wanna marry her. 
He's dressed for an occasion. 
SONJI (V.O.) I'm changing my damn clothes! You didn't like what I was wearin'! 
As Ali re-enters the living room, there's a knock on the door..."Room Service..." 
BUNDINI Come on in...! (sees) What's that? 
ROOM SERVICE (with large glass) What you wanted, isn't it...a water glass with vodka...? 
BUNDINI That was before... 
ROOM SERVICE Before what? 
BUNDINI Before you showed up... 
And, now, Sonji comes out. This dress makes what she had been wearing look demure. Tight angora sweater and a miniskirt. She's Tina Turner 30 years ago. 
SONJI I fine runnin' around in all these cute short things for you. I submissive to you. But I ain't gonna be submissive to the Brother X's and what they think. They askin' me questions alla time anyway. 
ALI What questions?! 
SONJI (V.O.) About you and us and I ain't tellin' 'em shit. 
CASSIUS CLAY, SR. (drunk) Tell it like it is, sugar! They took my boy's name...and what they give him back? Bad style. 
Ali takes her back into the bedroom and closes the door. 
SONJI I don't drink. I don't smoke. I converted to Islam for you and... 
INT. BEDROOM - SONJI + ALI - NIGHT 
SONJI All except the dress! I ain't puttin' no bleached-out, double- ugly bedsheets on this body, honey! I'm normal! 
He's furious. She smiles. He picks her up. She moans and her tongue darts in his ear and they're on the bed making out. And as CAMERA DRIFTS away we HEAR D.J. Daddio Daley's "Jazz Patio"... 
INT. A NEW CAR (CHICAGO) - ALI - DAY 
king of the city, cruising through the pristine winter air of Chicago... DADDIO (on radio) Hey there, old, aware ones. And you, too, my fair ones...This is "Daddio's Jazz Patio." ON KBCA this fine day, which is A-okay... 
Segues to...Brubeck's "Time Out," cruising... 
INT. THE AUDUBON BALLROOM, HARLEM - REAR OF MALCOLM'S HEAD - DAY 
center-punches the   FRAME through the green-glazed terra- cotta hallway. He    and his Bodyguard (#1) come to a door. Shedding his coat,   he hesitates, and like a prizefighter gathering himself,   he goes inside. 
INT. ALI'S NEW CAR - ALI - DAY 
at a light, waves to a cluster of girls waiting for a bus who recognize him, go nuts...listening to Brubeck... 
INT. THE AUDUBON BALLROOM - MALCOLM - DAY 
walks across the stage, aware of every little sound, every motion. He makes his way to the podium...peering beyond his glasses at the gathered. Bodyguard #1 goes to the side door instead of standing next to him...and Malcolm notices that...as he... 
MALCOLM X As-Salaam Alaikum... 
THE GATHERED Wa-Alaikum-Salaam... 
And two young Black men, TALMADGE HAYER and NORMAN BUTLER immediately stand up in the back, jostling each other... 
A YOUNG MAN (shouts) What you doin' in my pockets, man? Get your hand outta my pocket! 
MALCOLM X Hold it, hold it, brothers! (pleading) Let's be cool. 
And the commotion in the back diverts Bodyguards #1 and #2 towards the rear, away from the stage and Malcolm, as... 
THOMAS JOHNSON comes forward from a front row, his coat flapping open, revealing the 12-gauge sawed-off double- barrel shotgun coming up. 
MALCOLM'S EYES 
go to it.    Settle on it.   He new it was coming, as... 
JOHNSON, an indifferent expression on his face, FIRES one barrel at... 
MALCOLM 
...which rips through the lectern as if paper and SLAMS a dead-center into his chest a seven-ring. 12 pellets, each the size of .32 bullet. Seven destroy Malcolm's heart. Five shred his aorta and burrow into his spine. Malcolm's hands fly back, and he topples, crashing off empty chairs onto the floor. 
UPSIDEDOWN ECU:   MALCOLM'S FACE + PAST 
...as life exhales from his mouth and his eyes go grey, dying, indifferent to Johnson emptying a second blast into him and the meaningless indignities of Hayer and Butler firing a .45 and a 9mm Luger at him. 
INT. ALI'S CAR - RADIO - DAY 
Dave Brubeck, loud... 
INT. THE AUDUBON BALLROOM - STAGE - DAY 
Chaos. Malcolm on the floor. Betty kneels over his body, desperately trying to breathe life into it. An Asian woman, a disciple, holds up his head. Somebody shouts, "Jesus, God!" But there is no God today... 
INT. ALI'S CAR - ALI - DAY 
stops short at a light because a man runs across the street. 
enters. Stands at the dresser. Only his suitcase is there. She left her chartreuse blouse. He takes it and smells the scent of her cologne. He is torn with grief at the loss of her, curling into a ball on the bed, alone in the room. 
INT. GREEN ROOM - ALI - DAY 
getting made up by a good-looking ASIAN COSMETOLOGIST. An ASSISTANT DIRECTOR lounges against the wall with headset, reading the newspaper... 
COSMETOLOGIST You got the prettiest eyes... 
ALI Yeah? 
BUNDINI He so pretty, when you look up "pretty" in the dictionary, he too pretty to be there. 
She laughs and whispers something in Ali's ear, holding his hand where the others can't see it and slips her phone number to him. Meanwhile...a phone rings. Bundini answers while... 
A.D. (re: newspaper, to Ali) ...you gonna try for Germany? 
ALI Huh? 
A.D. You gonna try to get stationed in Germany? 
ALI What you talking about? 
BUNDINI Champ.   It's Eskridge... 
A.D. (Ali didn't know) They changed your classification. (turns page) It's in the paper...You're 1-A. You're gonna get drafted into the Army... 
ALI (takes phone) You know about this? 
CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE (V.O.) Yes. But I think the government's looking to negotiate a deal... 
A.D. (hears on headset) Here we go...! 
INT. A NEW YORK TELEVISION STUDIO, ABC - COSELL - DAY 
"Wide World of Sports" is ON THE AIR.   We've entered mid- broadcast. 
ALI ...I flunk their draft board test. Now, without testing if I am "wiser" or "worser," they decide I can go into the Army. 
HOWARD COSELL Cassius, it is my opinion you... 
ALI (cuts in) And I'm not Cassius Clay. That's a slave name. I'm a free man. I'm Muhammad Ali. 
HOWARD COSELL (stops, realizing) You know, I apologize to you. On the air. Your name is Muhammad Ali. You have the right to be called whatever you want. 
ALI (stays angry) You make a lot of mistakes for a so-called educated man. You really go to law school? 
HOWARD COSELL Yes, Muhammad. And to think I gave up a lucrative practice for the likes of you. 
ALI I'm the best thing that ever happened to you, Howard Cosell. Without me you be a tall white man with a microphone in his mouth. 
HOWARD COSELL (fast) And without me...you'd be a mouth. 
Ali lifts Howard's toupee. HOWARD COSELL (CONT'D) (into camera) We'll be right back. 
Laughter. 
INT. ABC TELEVISION STUDIO, BACKSTAGE - ALI + COSELL - LATER 
Ali pours three spoons of sugar in his coffee. 
HOWARD COSELL (sarcastic) Have a little coffee with your sugar...? 
ALI Keep talking. You were saying something half-smart... 
HOWARD COSELL They want to make an example out of you. 
ALI Why? I'm no Stokely Carmichael, H. Rap Brown... 
HOWARD COSELL All they are is political. They tell people how they ought to be. But you are the HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION of the WORLD. You're important. And they don't like your militancy, your politics. So, they'll make an example out of you. 
ALI ...of a good "Ne-gro," who do what he told? 
HOWARD COSELL Yes. Or, to demonstrate here is what happens to your ass if you don't... 
He's screwed either way. 
EXT./INT. THE UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES STATION, HOUSTON - LOBBY - CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE - DAY 
waits at the curb as Ali and Herbert pull up and get out of a car...move through the crowd...reporters shouting questions at him we don't hear, go up the steps, into the lobby, joining other recruits and M.P.'s. 
CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE (quietly) You do six weeks basic...you go into the Reserves...you don't go to Vietnam...you get to box...you even get to keep the money... 
He gives Ali a piece of paper signed by the Justice Department, confirming the deal... 
HERBERT (lets him know) The Messenger would not object if you joined under these terms. 
ALI I stay out of jail and I get to fight. HERBERT (nods) All you have to do is accept the induction. And life goes on. 
CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE They call your name. You say yes. 
We're not sure what Ali will do. 
INT. INDUCTION CENTER, HOUSTON - ALI - DAY 
ALI Can't fight here. Can't fight outside the country... 
CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE I know people in the restaurant business...want to start up a chain. Muhammad Ali's "Champ Burger"..."Muhammad Malts," "Fist Full of Fries"...all of that. 
They start out towards the gas pumps. 
ALI Why I want to be in the restaurant business?! 
CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE 'Cause you need the money. 
ALI How much all this gonna cost? 
CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE Too much.    They do that to you, too, you know. 
They seek to destroy every facet of Ali's life. Ali knows that. As they pass the pumps. Some customers recognize him. 
CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE (CONT'D) Where you goin'? 
ALI (to customers) Look out! 
CUSTOMER Hey, champ! 
And Ali pretends to start sparring. The working men laugh. One is brave enough to raise his hands, too. Ali smiles and trades a couple of phantom slaps. It breaks off. He made their day. He shakes each of their hands. His spirit's raised, he walks off. Chauncey watches this ritual... 
INT. CHICAGO APARTMENT, ALI + BELINDA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
hands and skin and faces against white in bed.   So close we are intimately inside the moment... 
ALI Not then... 
BELINDA First time? 1961...Sister Khalilah introduced you at assembly. You said you would be heavyweight champion of the world by the time you were twenty-one! 
ALI I always tell the truth... 
BELINDA I was eleven. I interviewed you for the student paper. You called me "little Indian girl," 'cause I wore my hair real long, in a braid...I told you..."Man, you scribble! You can't even write! You ought to go back to school until you do it better..." 
Laughing, he starts poking her in the ribs, and she turns onto him. She's six feet tall, he's six-three. He grabs her wrist. She wrestles him down on the large bed until there's a NOISE, and Belinda separates from Ali and approaches a smaller bedroom to replace the bottle their daughter, MARYUM, threw out of her crib. As she exits, MOVE IN on the crib in streetlight and we HEAR Jimi Hendrix's bottleneck instrumental part of "All Along the Watchtower." It makes us feel the child in the crib is threatened, and that takes us INTO... 
INT. COLLEGE HALL - ALI 
in a black leather jacket with a white shirt and skinny tie, speaking to an audience of college students, white and black, some Asian and Latino. 
JIMI HENDRIX (from "All Along the Watchtower") "There must be some kind of way outta here, said the joker to the thief..." 
Bingham waits in the wings. Applause. Ali joins Howard and a small group watching a portable TV... 
TV:   "DAYS OF RAGE" 
occurring on Chicago's North Clark Street. Off-screen we HEAR police sirens. On TV, Weathermen attack lines of Chicago police! The cops fall back. 
JIMI HENDRIX (CONT'D) "There's too much confusion, I can't get no relief. Business men, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth, None of them along the line, know what any of it is worth." 
INT. CHICAGO GYM - ALI - NIGHT 
trains in grey sweats to Hendrix. He flashes 60 sit-ups hanging off a table. He sweats profusely. He has no trainers. Bingham holds his legs. Ali seems heavier. 
The gym is grimy, filled with other boxers, a forest of heavy bags. Ali's one among other guys working out. 
ALI'S FACE 
grimacing through another set, trying to stay in shape, trying to retain skills going dormant. 
JIMI HENDRIX "No reason to get excited, the thief, he kindly spoke. There are many here among us, who feel that life is but a joke." 
Then, he's slow on the heavy bag.   Sparring alone in the ring... Everyone ignores him. 
INT. ALI'S GAS STATION - ALI'S TV:   NEWS - DAY 
REVEAL Ali + Bingham watching the 1968 Olympics. NOW, Tommy Smith and John Carlos bow their heads and raise fists in black power defiance, instead of acknowledging the national anthem. 
JIMI HENDRIX "But you and I, we've been through that, and this is not our fate. So let us not talk falsely now, the hour it's getting late..." 
And the coverage cuts to George Foreman with a small American flag in his hand. Then, it flashes back to Ali in the ring with Sonny Liston at his feet. And Ali coming out of the Illinois Boxing Commission, angry. Dead Black Panthers, Fred Hampton and Matt Clark murdered by police in Chicago. And Malcolm X and Ali together. The meaning of it is clear: MUHAMMAD ALI IS THE WARRIOR SAINT IN THE REVOLT OF THE BLACK ATHLETE IN AMERICA. On Ali watching, as a phone rings... 
JIMI HENDRIX (CONT'D) "All along the watchtower, princes kept the view, while all the women came and went, barefoot servants, too." 
EXT. MEMPHIS MOTEL - CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE - DAY

CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE ...struck out at the appellate level in New Orleans. So we're heading back to the Supreme Court... 
INTERCUT WITH: 
INT. ALI'S GAS STATION - ALI - DAY 
ALI Thought we already got turned down there. 
EXT. MEMPHIS MOTEL - CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE 
CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE I'm petitioning on a conscientious objection basis. Religious belief. We'll petition that your sincere religious belief prohibits you from shooting people. I believe they'll hear that... 
A fast car drives by, distracting Ali momentarily.   Then, Ali focuses 100% on... 
INT. ELIJAH MUHAMMAD'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT 
Elijah Muhammad reacts to the interview on television. There's a formality to Elijah Muhammad, even at his kitchen table. 
HOWARD COSELL You've made more money than all previous heavyweight champions combined. What about your management? Surely they have provided for you... 
ALI I'm saying it's time for everybody to quit lying! Muhammad Ali is the champ! I have to, I'll get the fight on myself. (beat) And if they offer me money, I ain't gonna turn it down. 
CROSSCUT:    Elijah turns to an aide. 
ELIJAH MUHAMMAD Get me my son, Herbert, on the telephone! 
INT. RUNDOWN CHICAGO GYM - ALI - DAY 
training. There is NO entourage with him. Ali hits the heavy bag. He doubles up the left jab on the taped-together heavy bag. Sweat stains his sweats. 
EXT. U.S. STEEL - ALI - DAY 
runs through tall reeds in the abandoned industrial landscape, ending at the lakefront and the cold, open sky and water. He's breathing hard, struggling against time to hold onto shape and prowess. He seems vulnerable against the open sky and water. 
INT. TEMPLE #2 - NIGHT 
Elijah Muhammad is at the lectern ringed by Fruit of Islam Guards. HERBERT is behind him. 
ELIJAH MUHAMMAD Mr. Muhammad Ali desires to do that which the Holy Qur'an teaches him against. I am, therefore, suspending Mr. Ali from the practice of Islam. He may no longer appear in temple, pray or teach, or have any conversation with any Muslim whatsoever. Furthermore...he may no longer use the name of Muhammad Ali. Henceforward, he will revert to his old slave name, Cassius Clay. 
INT. JEFFREY ST. HOUSE, KITCHEN - ALI - DAY 
sits at the table. A deep vacancy is beginning to be there we've never seen before. May-may makes a mess. 
BELINDA Muhammad...? 
ALI You can't call me that no more. 
BELINDA Hell, I can't. I'm defying them by talking to you. And being with you. 
MOVE CLOSER and CLOSER into Ali's eyes. He's oblivious. Belinda's pregnant again. She says something to him. Ali can't hear. She says it again, louder. Ali doesn't look at her. OVER ALI onto the Formica table with Log Cabin syrup and powdered sugar and ceramic salt and pepper shakers SEEN in his ECU, disconnected, depressed, withdrawn... 
INT. FLOPHOUSE, FOYER - ALI + BINGHAM - DAY 
entering, concerned and urgent... 
ALI Whyn't you call an ambulance or a doctor? 
LANDLADY (following behind) Wouldn't let me. Said he knew you...and to call you, Mr. Ali... He's not been out for three days... 
Ali's up the stairs, down the corridor and takes the key from the lady and opens the door. It's a dump. Rotting food, something burned on the stove. On the floor, wrapped in a threadbare bedspread, half in and out of the bathroom, which is foul, is Bundini, sleeping off a drunk. 
BINGHAM Bundini! 
BUNDINI (opens his eyes; half sits) Watchu' doin' here? Gimme that short dog! 
Ali -- his concern crashes. He detests the type Bundini resembles. He throws a half-empty half-pint of Old Taylor against the wall. It splatters... 
ALI What's wrong with you, man?! 
BUNDINI Nothin' wrong with me! 
Ali goes to the curtains and pulls them back.    Bundini, blinded... 
BUNDINI (CONT'D) What that?!!! 
BINGHAM A mystery...d-d-d-daylight... 
BUNDINI (shielding his eyes) Leave me alone! 
ALI I leave you alone.   You called me! 
BUNDINI That were a week ago... 
Ali grabs Bundini's arm and twists it and pushes his sleeve up. Bundini tries to pull his arm away. Ali is way stronger. Track marks up and down Bundini's arm. Ali slaps Bundini on the side of the head. SMACK! He slaps him again. SMACK! 
ALI What you shame yourself like this for, maaan...?! Why you shame yourself?! 
Bundini flails back with his arms.    Ali leans in and SMACKS him again. 
BUNDINI Lemme alone! (shouts) I'm flyin'! The Sky Chief talk through me. I know the word! 
ALI You know "low." You so low, the curb look like up! 
BUNDINI (demonstrates) Yeah? The king gotta go home to his throne! From the root to the fruit...! 
ALI Those rhymes is old.    Forget 'em. 
BUNDINI (demonstrates more) God don't care about you! Don't care about me! In all of everything, we mean nothin'. He don't know us. We be. And that's the onliest thing he did. And that's good 'cause that's why we free. But free ain't easy. Free is real. And realness is a motherfucker... (low; almost spooky) It eats raw meat. (beat) It walk in its own shoes. (beat) It does not waver... (pause) Yeah... 
There's a pause in the room.    Bundini crashes.    He starts crying, unabashedly... 
BUNDINI (CONT'D) I sold your belt for five hundred dollars to a barber on Lenox Avenue. That's how low I did you. I'm filled with weakness and got a crazy mind. That belt say you the Heavyweight Champion of the World. Five hundred dollars and I put it into my arm. That's what I called to tell you... 
Ali leans back against the wall...the last vestige, gone. 
BUNDINI (CONT'D) ...heard 'bout the Nation, all that court stuff. 
Ali gets in, Frazier takes off. He sits sideways on the seat, steers with one finger, flicks on the radio: Isaac Hayes. FRAZIER (CONT'D) What the hell you in Philly for? Philly my town. 
ALI To be closer to you, honey. 
FRAZIER Fuck you. 
ALI There be two undefeated heavyweight champions! And they ain't fighting! 
FRAZIER I wanna fight you! Said it a hundred times. The Man won't let you fight no more. What you complainin' to me for? ALI 'Cause you gotta get behind this and we gotta do this. 
Frazier screeches to a stop in the middle of Columbia Avenue. 
FRAZIER We..."gotta" do nothin'!!! 
ALI You wanna get this on, Joe?     You and me? Or not?! 
FRAZIER What about your license? 
ALI I can fight in Atlanta. 
FRAZIER How's that? What about the Boxing Commission? 
ALI Georgia ain't got no state boxing commission. And Atlanta got a black city council; a liberal Jewish mayor, Sam something. It all set. I do a prelim in Atlanta with Jerry Quarry. But we got to get the steamroller movin' now. 
FRAZIER What I got to do? 
ALI You announce that if I beat Quarry you give me the title shot. (puts it to him) So what you say...maaan? 
Frazier stops in front of his renovated duplex in the North Philadelphia ghetto. 
FRAZIER My daddy was a sharecropper. I worked in a slaughterhouse...right on that corner. I came up from nothing. (raises fist) What I got, I got with this. And I already got the title. So I got nothing to win and everything to lose. 
ALI But you know you ain't the champ yet. 
FRAZIER (looks at him) Yeah..."yet." (beat) All right. You beat Quarry, I'll get inna ring and fuck you up... 
They drive off.   After a moment, Frazier looks sideways at him. 
FRAZIER (CONT'D) (quieter) You need any money or anything to tide you by...? 
ALI (turns away) I'm fine. Thanks. 
And Ali rests a hand on Frazier's shoulder, and they drive off like that. 
INT. FIFTH STREET GYM - ALI + LARRY HOLMES - DAY 
sparring. Ali's sweating more than we have seen him sweat before. It's pouring off him. It stains wet his grey sweatsuit. INTO HIS EYES, through the headgear... 
WIDER 
Bingham takes pictures. Sarria, Rudy and the media in force are there for the start of Ali's comeback. 
FROM BEHIND ALI'S HEAD GEAR 
Ali spots...a figure step through the door. It's Bundini. Ali, seeing everything all the time, reacts not at all, turns his back. Bundini is thin, drawn, stooped, but clear- eyed. Everyone turns. It takes tremendous courage for Bundini to walk to the ring, expecting another rejection. 
ANGELO DUNDEE TIME!! 
Ali goes to Angelo in his corner. 
ANGELO DUNDEE (CONT'D) Weight's comin' down. 222. 
Ali first acknowledges Bundini.     Ali moves down the rope, scowls down at him. ALI What you want? 
BUNDINI Take me back, boss. 
ALI You want me to take you back? 
BUNDINI I'm clean. (beat) And you a resurrection. This is God's act. Anybody love poor people and little people and fucked-up people gotta be a prophet. (MORE) 
BUNDINI (CONT'D) And the prophet is going home. You the sun. Let me live in the light. (pause) Take me with, boss. (beat) ...I'll do anything. 
Ali considers this man: all jive and bullshit and also his shaman and resident poet. 
ALI (quietly) You can't hit what you can't see. 
Bundini slowly comes alive, then: BUNDINI (quietly) Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee. 
They look at each other. 
ALI/BUNDINI (quietly) Rumble, young man, rumble! 
INT. CITY AUDITORIUM, ATLANTA - ALI + QUARRY - NIGHT 
We've entered mid-fight in the second round. We're VERY CLOSE. Quarry has Ali against the ropes. Ali pushes him off. Quarry comes in again. Ali dances, feints and catches Quarry over his right eye with a jab thrown while going backwards! 
QUARRY 
shakes it off. Reorganizes. Throws two jabs, a right to the body and tries to follow it up with a left hook. Ali ties him up. The ref separates them. Quarry comes in again. Ali throws a left cross over Quarry's right, which Ali leaned away from, and adds two rapid, glancing jabs to the same spot. And Ali OPENS A CUT. The BELL sounds, ending Round Two. 
CROWD 
goes nuts, that part that's pro-Ali: Atlanta's black elite and scattered whites. And the thunderous noise becomes one sound, one momentum, cheering their warrior saint, their defiant champion's return. And their ROAR becomes THUNDER...a momentum unto its own, driving... 
ALI I can move my jaw with my tongue. He got me... 
Pacheco looks into his mouth. 
PACHECO (concerned) It's broke. I think...I think your jaw's broke. 
Meanwhile, Ali spots... 
REFEREE 
curious about the activity in Ali's corner, starts over... 
PACHECO nods to Dundee. Dundee starts to reach. Ali snatches Angelo's hand holding the towel. Angelo's about to end the fight... 
ALI Ain't stoppin' nothin'...! (glares at them) Nothin' stoppin'...! 
A BELL sounds and Ali goes out to fight in an OVERHEAD SHOT. 
BURN OUT TO WHITE: 
INT. SAN DIEGO SPORTS ARENA, ALI AND HIS CORNERMEN + SECURITY - NIGHT 
leave the ring and another defeat, as they move up the aisle towards the locker room... 
INT. ALI'S WOODLAWN AVENUE HOUSE (CHICAGO), LIVING ROOM - ALI - DAY 
watching television. The place is a huge mansion on Chicago's South Side. 
HERBERT Now that Smokin' Joe's run out of tomato cans to beat up, I finally got Yank to commit to a rematch with you in about six months. Frazier said he'd be happy with three mil... (beat) 
WIDEN TO INCLUDE THE LIVING ROOM WITH BINGHAM, ALI'S TWINS -- RASHEEDA AND JAMILLAH -- MUHAMMAD, JR. AND MARYUM 
HERBERT (CONT'D) I'll fly to Jamaica and get Yank to sign right after Joe beats this big stiff. (to TV) 
OVER ALI:    CONSOLE TV 
They watch the Frazier-Foreman fight from Jamaica amid the wonderful chaos generated by kids and their toys, who crawl all over Ali as if he were furniture. Frazier and Foreman are in the center of the ring... We SEE Don King in Frazier's corner. 
ALI (through still-wired- together jaw) Foreman call me one time after he won the Olympics... 
Meanwhile, Frazier bobs and weaves, ducks and moves like he did with Ali. Joe throws a left hook, leaning forward with it. Before it lands, Foreman unleashes a hard right that jolts Frazier SIDEWAYS. Frazier throws another hook that misses. Foreman hits him with a combination of right and three lefts...two hooks and an uppercut that LIFTS FRAZIER OFF THE GROUND. Ali leans in to SEE... 
HOWARD COSELL (shouting) DOWN GOES FRAZIER! DOWN GOES FRAZIER! 
ON TV:    THE RING 
Frazier stands. The referee does the mandatory eight-count. Foreman bangs Frazier into the corner and blasts him again. Frazier tries to muscle out of the corner. Foreman lifts and throws him back into the corner. Foreman's power is unreal. Frazier is the man who beat Ali. Now, Frazier feints and slides sideways, and Foreman hits him in the back of the head. Frazier goes down again. It is savage. Here is a new world champion: George Foreman. 
BINGHAM (wry) B-b-be easy gettin' a Frazier fight now. He ain't the champ of anything except getting knocked down. 
INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN (ALI-FRAZIER II) - HANDS + ARMS - NIGHT 
grabbing. Holding. Ali's got Joe's powerful left tied up this time. A clinch. Separating. A punch. A hook. Clinching. They separate... 
OVER JOE: 
Ali, having Joe at the right range, hits him. Joe moves in. Ali DRAGS him closer and ties him up. They dance... 
THEIR BODIES 
Ali does a little shuffle, circles to keep Joe at hitting distance, lands a combination. Joe closes, but Ali won't let him in and ties up Joe. We hear a BELL and that's the end of the fight. Not a bang; a whimper. 
REFEREE 
holds up Ali's hand and mouths silently words we cannot hear. And as we MOVE CLOSER INTO ALI'S EYES, we see no exaltation. This is a victory, but a hollow one. It's a decision eked out. 
INT. NEW YORK COFFEE SHOP - WIDE 
The inner circle:    Ali, Pacheco, Dundee, Bundini, Bingham. 
ALI So. 
ANGELO DUNDEE So we only eked this one out. And George Foreman makes Frazier look like a sissy. 
PACHECO You see their fight? 
HOWARD BINGHAM You mean the Joe Frazier falling- down lesson? 
PACHECO And Foreman is 24. You are 32 years old. I don't want to see your head get turned into someone's bull's-eye. 
ANGELO DUNDEE ...but, you go? We're the corner, same as always. But it ain't gonna be easy. 
ALI (to Angelo) You think I still got the tools? 
ANGELO DUNDEE You got the tools, Daddy.     But they different. 
ALI (thinks; decides: go) Well, you better sharpen 'em up. 'Cause we goin' to Africa. BUNDINI The motherland. From the root to the fruit. We gonna rumble...in the jungle. 
ALI It's time to be heavyweight champion of the world again. 
BUNDINI Yeah, man! 
INT. NEW YORK PRESS CONFERENCE - DAY 
enters from his bungalow. We SEE we're in a compound. They are white and severely truncated houses linked by sidewalks and too many large street lamps. As Ali starts to jog through this imitation of suburbia with the scale all wrong. It's like a Gulag in reverse for the rich and powerful to be within while keeping the rest of the country out. As Ali passes, REVEAL we are at the bank of the Congo River. As Ali starts his predawn run, across the river the first band of magenta tints the horizon and reflects molten on the water. 
TRACKING SHOT:    ALI + DUNDEE, SARRIA IN A PICKUP TRUCK - RED DAWN 
plus two trainers and the ever-present Zairian POLICEMAN, Lt. Nsakala. The early paints the red-earth ochre. 
ALI (to himself) Fast. Six left jabs flash from his chest and shoulder, followed by a right hook and left and right uppercuts. 
ALI (CONT'D) (to himself) Back up, maaan... (weaves suddenly; another voice) ...you fast! 
Ali slides to the right and throws a left jab and hooks off the jab. EXT. KINSHASA ROAD - EMPTY ROAD - MORNING LIGHT 
Ali ENTERS, running. The road is lined with Mobutu's green billboards in French and English, proclaiming Zaire wonderful. A few kids emerge from behind the signs, coming out from between...and they trail Ali. 
KIDS Ali, boma ye! 
ALI (repeating) Ali, boma ye George Foreman! 
And he throws a couple at an imaginary George Foreman. There are 15 to 16 kids, now. 
ALI (CONT'D) You out, sucker! Curious, Ali runs behind the green signs from where the kids came. 
ALI'S 
still jogging. Behind the signs, he becomes a magnetic attraction. People are surprised to see Ali. He's making their day. Euphoric kids parallel him, run with him, follow him... 
PAST ALI: 
the concrete-and-cinder-block walls to the dusty, bare ground are chromatic. Primary colors. Ethnographically interesting. 
ALI SEES interiors. Broken walls. No roof. No plumbing. People come from a ditch with a shower curtain for privacy, surprised to see Ali. Faces indifferent to squalor. This is the ethnographically "interesting" surface of what, in fact, is civic disintegration starting to occur... It is the human concomitant to 13 years of Mobutu kleptocracy. 
ALI 
looks at the backs of the signs. He and we realize the signs' purpose: to hide the makeshift plastic walls and rooms made from cardboard containers and oil drums from the foreigners traveling the road to Kinshasa. One TEENAGER WITH A WITHERED ARM and a big smile runs up... 
TEENAGER (broken English) You beat them, Ali! 
ALI Foreman?   I kill him! 
He mimes knocking out Foreman. Something powerful is affecting Ali. We don't know what it is. Ali slows down... 
...throws two lightning jabs and a hook. Ali reaches to the kid's head and pulls a coin. He flips it to another kid and walks on. A SECOND TEENAGER comes out and wants Ali to look at something around the back. He takes Ali's hand...and holds it. Ali complies. The entourage follows... 
AROUND CORNER:   KIDS' PAINTING ON WALL 
It's an imitation fight poster. Childlike caricatures in Basquiat-like brush strokes. Foreman's got crosses for eyes. He's out! Ali is victorious! His fist is raised. His cartoon face shouts his victory...the people's champion. There's more. There's knocked-out white policemen, knocked- out black soldiers, knocked-out landlords, knocked-out South Africa, knocked-out planes and tanks, knocked-out tse-tse flies...everything! 
So much, it means "ALL"...all expectation. This childish painting powerfully affects Ali. The kids look at him. It's still. Some kids in the back leap up in the air to see over taller heads what Ali's doing. 
ALI 
looks at individual faces. A grinning OLDER MAN with a blue transistor radio (we'll see him later). A smiling kid. A girl with no shoes. A teenage kid jumping up and down...all looking at him. Ali makes four pieces of rope appear. He rubs them together... 
ALI (CONT'D) Shazaam!!! 
They become one. Everybody goes nuts. As Ali leaves, his eyes go back to the people and the painting... 
EXT. KINSHASA ROAD - ECU:   ALI'S FACE - MORNING (GREEN SCREEN) 
ALI (to himself) ...even if I die here. If it kill me, no matter what...I gotta win. 
Concentration has taken him into the athlete's zone, the state of unified awareness wherein dwells his total self- knowledge. And he knows the transaction: what they give him with their adoration, which he converts to power, is in exchange for what he means to them. And what he means to them is specific: he represents them in defying power and vanquishing what oppresses. He validates the existence of expectation, that struggle is possible...George Foreman, mute and unknowingly, represents disinterested power. Ali doesn't "accept" his obligation; he embraces it. It is his purpose, revealed. And he will never waver from it. 
CUT TO: 
INT. INTERCONTINENTAL HOTEL, ANTEROOM (KINSHASA) - ALI - DAY 
waits, sitting on a table edge in a corridor. Noise of a press conference setting. Howard Cosell crosses through, smoking. Bingham enters and gestures...they're ready. Ali waves off Bingham, stops Cosell... 
ALI Howard! How many you ugly sportswriters in there got me over Foreman? Don't lie. 
HOWARD COSELL (beat) Some of us...Norman, me...are worried. How you gonna dance against George?? He's sparring with a middleweight, training to cut you off. He gets you against the ropes, he can knock you out with either hand. 
ALI (drops facade) What's the odds? 
HOWARD COSELL Two-and-a-half-to-one. Against. We're worried you're going to get hurt. 
No one thinks Ali will win. 
INT. INTERCONTINENTAL HOTEL, MEDIA CONFERENCE ROOM - CLOSE: ALI - DAY 
ALI This'll be the biggest upset since Sonny Liston. I want all of you to write it down! This fight is no contest! 
We've jammed into the middle of Ali in a blast of braggadocio. ALI (CONT'D) George Foreman is a big mummy. I've officially named him "The Mummy." 
Laughter. 
ALI (CONT'D) George punches are like "Look out, here come the left." Whomp! (stiff-armed swing) Here come the right! Whomp! Like a Mummy. But "The Mummy" can't hit what it can't see. I'm fast! Gonna dance. Be all over George. George is gonna feel he surrounded. (beat) And I done somethin' new for this fight; I done rassled with an alligator. Anticipatory laughter. They've had twelve years' experience of Ali's stand-up and know when a new routine's starting... 
ALI (CONT'D) That's right! (laughter again; Ali almost loses it) I have rassled with an alligator. I done tussled with a whale. I done handcuffed lightning, thrown thunder in jail. That's bad! Only last week I murdered a rock. Injured a stone. Hospitalized a brick. I'm so mean, I make medicine sick. 
Laughter. 
BELINDA (CONT'D) Maryum is sick. Maybe I oughta go back to Chicago and look after her. 
ALI Sure. 
BELINDA I'll be back before the fight. (sarcastic) If that's all right, my husband... 
He walks out the door. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. KINSHASA ARENA - 75 ZAIRIAN TRIBAL DANCERS - NIGHT 
to percussion.      The number. 
ALI, 
Angelo and Bingham in the empty seating, looking at the ring under the canopy. Behind them is the rehearsal. Meanwhile... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. ARENA, ENTRANCE - TWO CARS 
arrive, including in the first an Interpreter, Zairian Official #2, a Policeman Driver; and in the second car is Don King, Herbert, VERONICA, and another American Woman (silent bit). They're in a hurry... 
EXT. ARENA - ALI 
is being taught to dance by two dancers. They fail. In the background, workers are raising gigantic Mobutu portraits. The Pointer Sisters begin. 
AISLE 
Don King and entourage approach. 
DON KING (over the drumming) Champ! Champ! George had an accident. 
ANGELO DUNDEE (suspicious) What are you talking about? 
Pointer Sisters start "Yes, We Can Can." 
DON KING Got cut. Right above his right eye. His sparring partner's elbow. Split it open, so... 
ANGELO DUNDEE Can he fight? 
DON KING Not for six weeks. 
Ali laughs. 
DON KING (CONT'D) This is not a humorous situation, my champion. This postponement could be long, especially if George leaves. 
ANGELO DUNDEE Are you tryin' to pull something, Don? Ali wants his title. And he wants it back in Zaire. George leaves, he ain't comin' back. George don't like it here. 
Pointer Sisters' rehearsal cuts...re-organizes. 
DON KING How right you are, my suspicious and short Italian brother. And my fiduciary responsibility to this first all-black promotion is like a garden in the African sun. It must grow! It must bloom! It cannot flower in the gloom and shade of postponement to some dome. Like the Astrodome, the Super-dome, any dome outta Zaire, where it be deprived of light and bled of water. 'Cause what gonna bleed...is money. A hemorrhage of cash. (sees it all) ...blood on the floor. Double hotel costs. Double travel costs. Airplanes. Food and beverage... 
ANGELO DUNDEE (rhetorical) What do you expect us to do, Don? 
DON KING (moves close to Ali) Muhammad. Find a way to get George to stay. Be Moses in reverse: do NOT let my people go! Stay the fuck right here, in Egypt, if you'll pardon my Swahili. 
BINGHAM L-l-l-lingala. 
DON KING What? 
BINGHAM Lingala.   They s-s-s-speak Lingala. 
DON KING Who cares? 
Pointer Sisters probably end here.   After a beat, percussion starts up. Dancers drift in. 
ANGELO DUNDEE (pissed, dissed big) If George goes? You forfeit five million. You crawl back to Cincinnati. You ain't promotin' a charity raffle... 
We see Herbert watching all of this closely...particularly the challenge to Ali/Dundee. 
DON KING (irrepressible) If George goes? George goes, my champion, I will get you Joe Frazier. Ali-Frazier III...the fight everybody want to see. INT. PRESS CONFERENCE 
ALI (interrupts) Truth is...George knocked hisself out. 
Don King laughs, nervously.   Ali is daring George to stay. 
ALI (CONT'D) That's right. He did three rounds. Knew he was gonna lose to Muhammad Ali and knocked hisself out. And I predict that whenever the fight is set, he might not show up! 
DON KING (double entendre) You bad! 
ALI I'm a bad man! 
DON KING Ain't no doubt about it. 
ALI And you tell the same thing to George. 
Media laugh, Don King goes along, Ali continues... 
ALI (CONT'D) (to King) I been watchin' you! I heard you. I know he's your man. I know you got him picked. But the man's in trouble. (MORE) 
ALI (CONT'D) The whole world was gonna know. But, now, he ain't gonna show. That's why he knocked hisself out when he was training. 
ALI You been to Hong Kong?   Taiwan? Thailand? 
VERONICA No. 
ALI I can't go there. All the ladies out there from Indonesia, Japan, Hawaii, India... (high-pitched voice, imitating female fans) "Ali-i-i-e-e-e! Ali-e-e-e! Oh, Muhammad Al-i-i-i!" (speaks in faux foreign language, imitating female fans; to Bingham) You seen those people from Thailand? I was in Bangkok -- I couldn't walk. (laughter; hangs his head) I couldn't...I just couldn't do nothin'. "Get me outta this country!" (laughter) The women were so pretty... 
BINGHAM 'B-b-b-bout Hong Kong, man?!   You know what I heard? 
ALI (interrupts) Ladies in Thailand, their hair comes down to their knees...and they about Veronica's complexion...and they bad! (MORE) 
ALI (CONT'D) But they ain't nothin' like the "sisters." (holds Veronica's hands, looks deep into her eyes) Ain't NOTHIN' like the sisters! 
Veronica laughs as Ali mocks swooning over her...   Another news crew arrives. 
NEWS CAMERAMAN Champ... 
ALI (to Veronica) Let's go for a ride. 
EXT. KINSHASA SHANTYTOWN - KIDS - DUSK INTO NIGHT 
and old people, teenagers in dirty T-shirts with strange hats. Their eyes are wide. 
REVERSE:   ALI 
shows his bare hands. Now he rubs them together and MAGICALLY pulls from his closed fist a colored scarf.     The kids scream. 
VERONICA 
squints, trying to figure out how he did it, because... 
ALI 
shows the scarf, pushes back his cuffs so that he can't hide anything up his sleeves. His wrists are bare. He shows both sides. Now, he takes the scarf and pushes with his right hand and feeds it into the closed fist of his left. He looks up wide-eyed at everybody. Then, he opens his fingers and the scarf is not there! 
ALI + VERONICA 
walk, towering over the kids. One girl holds Ali's hand. The others maintain a respectful proximity so that they don't invade the space around Ali. 
ALI So why you glad we still here? 
VERONICA Holdin' this in Africa make people proud. All over the world. They're proud of you. Anybody can fight in Vegas. 
ALI That's one job.    I got two... 
They pass through cinder-block houses, shipping crates, oil drums for cooking fires, a few car parts. 
ALI (CONT'D) (melodramatic) ...gotta whup George! 
VERONICA Islamic faith help you to that? 
ALI Listen, girl, as a Muslim, I am busted out and failed in the eyes of God. I shoulda discovered Islam at 50! 'Cause I am weak on women. They take my eyes and my heart follow...causing me to be a lovin' husband and a terrible husband...! (looks down at her, intensely) ...green eyes and cocoa skin...? (feigns wobbly legs) ...okay, rest of me, let's go!! 
Veronica laughs. She brings his hand up to her mouth and kisses it. Hand in hand, a towering man and a towering woman walk away at their ease against the soft sky with their entourage of teenagers and kids. On the perimeter, a kid does flips and, then, gets distracted... 
INT. N'SELE GYM - SPEED BAG - DAY 
A syncopated, obscuring, blurred shape of the bag turned into a percussion instrument by Ali's fast hands trying to get even faster. 
ALI (to himself) Faster! Faster! 
DUNDEE (shouts) TIME! 
Ali SLAMS a right hook at the bag. It almost explodes. OPTIONAL: Ali takes body hits, tries sliding off head shots. 
INT. RING - ALI'S EYES 
feints his left and throws a right.   It surprises Holmes. 
HOLMES You can't lead a right hand.   Not at him! 
ALI Why not? 
HOLMES Too long...to get it there. Man, I mean, to think you could hit him with a right lead...it's insulting... Nobody would lead a right... 
Ali sees something beyond the ring. And, now, flicks four ripping left jabs into Holmes and slides sideways as Holmes tries to catch Ali with a right. But Ali changes directions, changes back and now comes over Holmes' right with his own left cross, and a six-or-seven-punch combination. It is Ali dancing and floating. Crowd cheers..."TIME." 
BUNDINI 
meanwhile, has thrown his arms around Dick Sadler, Foreman's manager. (We realize this is why Ali segued from serious work to snapping his traditional left jab.) 
BUNDINI I got him! Lock him up. 
SADLER (laughs) Hey, hold up, chump!   Make this chump turn me loose. 
Sadler's there with his wife and another couple. Rudy joins, laughing. Bundini turns loose Sadler. Ali and Sadler like each other. 
SADLER (CONT'D) This is my wife, Irene... 
Sadler affectionately puts an arm around Ali's neck and reaches up and pretends to hit Ali on top of the head with a fist for Bingham's camera. Ali bites his lower lip and starts wrestling with Sadler, putting him in a headlock. Sadler's arm is around Ali's waist. 
ALI Hey! Look! Look at George Foreman's trainer, feelin' me up on purpose! On the side, to see if I'm in shape! 
More laughter.     Sadler's beret falls off.   Rudy puts it back on. 
BELINDA (CONT'D) Do you want to marry her? 
ALI I follow my heart. 
BELINDA "You're following your heart"? (sarcasm falls away) That's what you do. No matter what anybody says. Or thinks. Or what it does... (pause) And what happens now? 
ALI I fight George. (after a beat) I didn't come this far to quit. 
BELINDA Neither of us did. 
Ali looks at her a moment. Then he leaves. Silence. Belinda sits on the bed. She looks up. Then she comes apart. She rips open a closet. She finds Veronica's clothes, rips them, shreds peignoirs, overturns a night table, strips the bed, smashes more furniture, throws Veronica's suitcase at the mirror. It does not break. She looks around the wrecked room. Bingham is standing there. 
BINGHAM Belinda? 
Belinda looks up, tears in her eyes. 
BINGHAM (CONT'D) You can't beat him. You can't beat him, 'cause you can't not love him. 
INT. ALI'S HOUSE, N'SELE, SHOWER - ALI - NIGHT 
under the water. It flows like silver down the contours of his face and neck. He is in that zone of concentration where the best athletes go...where the pre-motor cortex's activity dominates and facial expression becomes blank, eyes look distantly...Ali's in his domain...in the groove. 
EXT. COMPOUND, N'SELE, REAR SHOT:   ALI'S CITROEN - NIGHT 
and outriders depart. 
INT. MOBUTU'S PALACE, A SITTING ROOM - SERVANTS - NIGHT 
prepare a luxurious setting. On a platform is a large TV set. In front of it, with low tables are two large armchairs with antimacassars. At the door are Mobutu's spit-and-polish paratrooper bodyguards. They STOMP their feet to attention as... 
MOBUTU 
in his tan uniform and signature leopard-skin hat enters, followed by an entourage of aides. 
MOBUTU'S MILITARY AIDE (in French) We are ready, your excellent President for Life... 
MOBUTU (in French) Invite Monsieur Idi to join me now... The Banker? The American? 
MOBUTU'S MILITARY AIDE (in French) They are waiting in the sitting room. 
INT. ALI'S DRESSING ROOM - DUNDEE 
wrapping Ali's hands, tears the tape into narrow strips to go between the fingers. Doc Broadus, from Foreman's camp, observes the wrapping, then signs it. In addition to function, the taping feels ritualistic. 
CLOSE:    ALI'S 
attention is focused elsewhere...on his action:    what he will do, his strategy. 
LIEUTENANT NSAKALA (from doorway) Countdown! Countdown! 
RUDY Countdown is on, bro.   Five minutes. 
Ali gets off the training table. Angelo has finished. He puts on his robe and starts warming up before the mirror, throwing punches for a full minute. 
HERBERT 
enters.    Ali and Herbert go to an alcove. 
ALI Thanks to Allah... (praying) 
LIEUTENANT NSAKALA (shouts) Four minutes! 
Sarria sticking sealed bottles filled with honey, orange juice and water into the water bucket. As Ali puts on the robe, the others gather up the gear, start out. Herbert moves to Ali, preparing for the entrance, to be as close to him for the cameras as possible... 
ANGELO DUNDEE Give us a moment. Alone. (off Herbert's look) Hey. This is my religion! 
Herbert and Pat Patterson, the bodyguard, with his chrome- plated .45, follow the others away from Ali. Angelo begins applying Vaseline on Ali's face. They're alone in the room. 
ANGELO DUNDEE (CONT'D) It's hot. Humid. Monsoon season's about to start. May hit 140 in the ring under the lights. You all right? 
ALI Why? 
ANGELO DUNDEE Where you at? 
ALI (looks up) Foreman ain't no mummy. He's knocked out eight out of eleven before the end of the third round. He the most dangerous fighter I ever fought. 
ANGELO DUNDEE I'd worry if I was hearin' anything else. 
Ali loosens up his neck. 
ALI And I can't WAIT! 
LIEUTENANT NSAKALA Three minutes! 
ANGELO DUNDEE Dance.   That's the most important... 
Ali looks at Dundee enigmatically.     Before Angelo can ask... 
BUNDINI 
throws towels across Ali's shoulders. Ali puts on his long African robe, which is white with African-graphic trim on the cuffs of the sleeves and the hem. 
BUNDINI (whispers) Forget every battle of man against man, of mind against mind, of soul against soul. This is the one. This is the greatest. 
OVERHEAD 
as Ali, Foreman and both their crews meet in the center of the ring. 
CLAYTON Now, both of you know the rules. When I step back, I want a good, clean break. (Clayton keeps going) No hitting below the belt, no kidney punches, no... 
ALI Motherfucker, you 'bout to discover you ain't nothin'. 
CLAYTON Ali, be quiet! 
George's eyes glare.    Ali rocks back and forth, ready to rumble. 
CLAYTON (CONT'D) No kidney punches. Now... 
ALI (past the ref; eyeballing George) You been hearin' about me for years. All your life you been hearin' about Muhammad Ali. Now you gotta face me. 
CLAYTON Ali, I'll disqualify you. Now, I want a good, clean, sportsman fight... 
ALI (to Foreman) You never should have come to Africa. 
Foreman is unfazed by all of this.    His cold eyes say "battery and homicide." 
CLAYTON (blows up) All right!! (beat) Now go to your corners and come out fighting when you hear the bell, and may the best man...win... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
Ali turns his back and continues to shuffle and shadowbox. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
OVERHEAD:    ALI + FOREMAN'S 
corners are clear. Ali is facing his corner, praying to Allah. Foreman is bent over at the waist, flexing and releasing the last tension in his huge shoulders, as the bell for ROUND ONE clangs... 
THE RING - BOTH 
charge out and stop as if they ran into a brick wall five feet from each other. Then Ali dips, throws a left, which George takes on the shoulder...a BIG RIGHT HAND to George's head. The crowd goes nuts. George clinches, picks up Ali and swings him through 180 degrees with his power. As he puts Ali down, Ali pushes George's head down and away and Ali clocks him with ANOTHER RIGHT. Foreman clinches and drives Ali back to the rope. Ali throws ANOTHER RIGHT that lands. Ali dances, circles, stays out of Foreman's way. Then he slams him again with a right. 
Foreman gets Ali in the corner, throws vicious combinations and a hook that nails Ali in the body and a wild shot hits Ali on the side of the head. CLOSER ON ALI...stunned, his eyes clear. He's just taken a Foreman shot. He pushes Foreman, the stronger man, out of the way and dances and circles. Foreman ties him up again. Ali pushes out, dances and hits HIM with a RIGHT. Ali ties him up, and there's the BELL. 
ALI'S CORNER:     ALI 
ALI (to himself) Legs heavy...air's heavy...like sand... 
SLOWLY MOVE IN ON ALI as Angelo and Bundini's talk fades away. We see Ali's awareness in a deep concentration. He is holding counsel with himself. Ali stares into space across the diagonal to the other corner, but not really at Foreman. Ali is weighing something. A gamble. He blinks, and whatever it is, he's decided it NOW. AMBIENT SOUND starts to come back as Ali's attention returns to the present and he ignores... 
ANGELO DUNDEE ...keep moving. Don't let him put you into the corner. Stay off the rope! 
THE BELL FOR ROUND TWO 
Ali charges into the center of the ring, provoking Foreman to chase him, and Ali immediately BACKS TO THE ROPE. And stays there! Seizing opportunity, Foreman throws big hooks. ALI IS DOING EXACTLY WHAT HE'S NOT SUPPOSED TO DO. He gets off the rope and backs to the rope on the other side. Most of the shots are blocked by the gloves of both men. No damage. Then George throws a left, which Ali blocks, and a big right hook. 
ALI 
turns away.     Nevertheless, it crashes into his jaw. 
MACRO ALI 
TIME SLOWS. He ties up George. We SEE Ali's hurt.        Dazed. But he must make George believe he's unhurt. 
ALI That all you got...?   That it? 
Foreman reacts. Ali takes vicious hooks to the midsection, hangs on and goes right back onto the ropes, tying Foreman up. 
LOW ANGLE 
George's shots are taken on Ali's elbows and gloves. But for every four that are thrown, one or two tremendous hooks get through to Ali's ribs, his side. 
ALI'S FACE 
reveals impact, but nothing diminishes the TERRIBLE FORTITUDE with which he endures. Now, he ties up George. Now, George drives Ali into the corner and pummels him. 
ANGELO + BUNDINI going crazy in the corner! 
ANGELO DUNDEE Get off the ropes! Get off the ropes! Get off the ropes! Dance! 
Ali blocking, getting hit.   WORRIED FACES in the crowd.       One woman looks away. 
ALI'S EYES 
alive, more than alert, the sharpest eyes in boxing. 
FOREMAN'S LEFT JAB 
coming in.   Ali feints, shifts.   It misses by a quarter of an inch. 
FOREMAN HOOKS OFF HIS JAB Ali leans back on the top rope. Foreman's punch falls short and connects with little effect. That's how good is Ali. The techniques BECOME CLEAR. 
Foreman goes upstairs, throws three hooks, all get taken on Ali's gloves. Foreman slams a hook that began in Cape Town and ends up in Zaire, into Ali's abdomen. And another. Ali takes the shots, hangs on. 
ALI'S EYES 
are bright like stars.   His white mouth guard shines.     A grimace? A grin?

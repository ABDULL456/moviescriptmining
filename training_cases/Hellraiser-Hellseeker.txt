INT. CAR DRIVING DOWN COUNTRY ROAD - DAY 
KIRSTY GOODING looks out the passenger window as the trees go whizzing past. She's attractive, late twenties, warmly sophisticated. Something makes her smile. She turns to the driver and thinks real hard as she says this. 
KIRSTY Okay. Cubic root of nine thousand two hundred and sixty one. 
TREVOR is her husband, late twenties as well. God gave him brains and beauty. He has used them both prodigiously. 
TREVOR Twenty one. Why do we have to do this now Kirsty? 
KIRSTY Shut up and play darling. Your turn. 
TREVOR Five hundred ninety two thousand seven hundred and four. 
KIRSTY Uh... eighty two? 
TREVOR Eighty four. 
Kirsty takes a calculator out of her purse and double checks the math. 
KIRSTY You win! Okay pull over. 
TREVOR (looking at his watch) But... I thought... 
KIRSTY (laughing) If what I've heard is true this could be the last time for a long long time. Besides we've got a whole seven minutes before the next one. Clock's ticking. Tick-tock... 
Trevor waits a moment to see if she's kidding. 
KIRSTY (through clenched teeth) PULL OVER NOW. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Then pulls over to the side of the road. Kirsty reaches over, quickly unzips his pants immediately goes down on Trevor OUT OF FRAME. He reacts accordingly. A little pleasure, utter shock. 
KIRSTY'S VOICE (from BELOW FRAME) Honey what's wrong? 
Kirsty rises INTO FRAME once again. 
TREVOR What isn't wrong? Why are you doing this anyway? 
KIRSTY (self-conscious) I'm... I'm doing a very special thing here. And you can't even ... respond? 
TREVOR Sorry honey the present situation isn't exactly fodder for an erection. Shouldn't we be getting to the hospital? 
FULL ON Kirsty. For the first time WE SEE her big pregnant belly sticking out. She looks at Trevor innocently. 
KIRSTY I was going to keep breathing you know. You think I'm an amateur or something? 
Trevor stuffs himself back in his pants, puts the car in gear and presses the accelerator. 
TREVOR Just concentrate on the task at hand please. Listen to me. You should be giving ME this lecture. 
KIRSTY You've been cheating on me haven't you? 
TREVOR Yes I had a quickie with the neighbor during your last contraction. 
KIRSTY Roughly two thirds of married men who cheat start during the eighth month of their wives' first pregnancy. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
TREVOR I would never cheat on you. Not while you're pregnant now you know that. 
KIRSTY (features tightening) Okay... uh oh here comes another one. 
TREVOR Share the pain Kirsty. 
CONTINUED: (4) 
Ambrose gives Trevor a fatherly smile then EXITS, not even looking at Allison. Allison watches him go, then turns back to Trevor... then smiles perkily. 
ALLISON Well looks like you're going home! Hope you brought your bus pass. 
INT. BUS - NIGHT 
Trevor starts nodding out. The bus is practically empty. TWO BLACK CHILDREN a boy and a girl sit across from Trevor. A CREEPY OLD WOMAN sits further back, knitting something. 
A CHURCH BELL RINGING causes Trevor to wake again up, wincing at the sound. As the church passes the BELL becomes louder and louder. 
Trevor hears LAUGHTER and looks up at the children. The girl and her brother seem to be play-fighting over a toy they hold between them. Trevor looks at the toy getting stretched this way and that. 
TREVOR Do you kids mind keeping it down? 
The creepy old woman speaks up. 
OLD WOMAN Aww let them be. They're only kids. 
Trevor notices what the Old Woman is knitting is a baby's bootie. As the children continue to laugh at him Trevor stares at the bootie tears welling up. 
INT. TREVOR'S APT. - NIGHT 
Trevor lives in a dingy place, one step up from poverty- level. Funny thing is this used to be a nicer place. We see remnants of a feminine touch long since past. Dirty dishes sit in the sink. A cockroach skitters across the kitchenette. 
Trevor sits at his TV playing an extremely violent videogame. We're talking heads getting blown off, bodies exploding, limbs being severed. As the end ends a DEMONIC VOICE chuckles from the TV. 
DEMONIC VOICE FROM TV YOU LOSE... 
The screen flashes TRY AGAIN? Trevor takes a swig of beer and sits back in the easy chair looking at something atop the TV. A picture of Kirsty. 
INT. TREVOR'S KITCHEN - NIGHT 
Trevor looks through an old photo album. Pictures of him and Kirsty. Some pictures of him. A lot of pictures of Kirsty. Smiles, smiles, smiles... 
He stops at one close up of them mugging at a camera they've pointed on themselves. All we see is their faces, the rest is dark and blurry, except for one thing. A small shadowy object Kirsty is holding. 
EXT. CUBIC ROUTE ACTUARIAL RESEARCH - DAY 
Dressed in a button down shirt and tie, Trevor walks up to the pale utilitarian box-like structure. 
INT. CUBIC ROUTE, BULLPEN - DAY 
It is a maze of cubicles iced by harsh fluorescence. It is a mill of data research, where the TAPPING of fingers on computer keypads never ends... 
INT. TREVOR'S CUBICLE - DAY 
... no thanks to Trevor, who has already resumed his head-in- hands position at his desk. He rubs his eyes, seemingly blinded by the screen staring back at him. 
A MAN Trevor's age rolls up on his office chair beside Trevor, banging into the desk. BRET. Trevor's co-worker and cubicle mate. 
BRET Trevor what is the metric probability of you getting any work done at all today? 
TREVOR Hey Bret. Christ, my head feels like a split coconut. 
BRET Dude there is a track on the carpet between here and the bathroom. It was made by your ass. You've been dragging it all fucking week. What happened to you yesterday? 
Bret eyes Trevor suspiciously. Then smiling... 
BRET (cont'd) You never came back after lunch. Did you get a piece o'ass, you bastard? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
TREVOR Give me a break. I checked back into the hospital- amongst other things. 
BRET Hospital? You haven't been to the hospital since uh... 
TREVOR Since what? 
BRET (getting uncomfortable) Look never mind. Just get some numbers going- any numbers at all will due. The hills have eyes remember? 
Bret casually gestures to a surveillance camera overhead that sweeps across the room like a prison spotlight. 
Lange checks the report again. He believes Trevor...or does he? 
LANGE'S VOICE That's a start. I'll tell the people trawling the river maybe it makes a difference maybe not. Thanks for your help Trevor. If we have any more questions you'll get a call from myself or my partner Detective Givens. 
Lange stands up and backs up awkwardly to a file behind his desk. Trevor stares at him suspiciously. 
TREVOR You guys know something I don't? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
LANGE All things considered we probably know a lot less than you do. Have a good afternoon, Mr. Gooding. 
Trevor exits, both men maintain eye contact as the door closes between him. 
EXT. BUS STOP - NIGHT 
The bus pulls up to the curb. Trevor climbs out and starts walking down the empty street. As soon as the bus pulls away, the only sound heard is Trevor's footsteps. 
POV BEHIND TREVOR: We see Trevor's back from a slight distance. Someone is following him. 
Sensing this, Trevor looks behind him. Nothing but an empty sidewalk. Trevor hurries his pace, almost there at his apartment building. He glances behind him again. Nope, nobody there... then suddenly- 
-A DARK FIGURE passes under a streetlight on the opposite side of the street. Trevor turns a corner no picking up the pace a little. The DARK FIGURE follows, it picks up it's pace as well. 
Trevors walks an d approaches a small alley way. Should he take this home? 
A enraged Pitbull nearly rips his nose off as it Barks and lunges to the end of a heavy chain leash. Trevor (and us) about piss our pant's. The dog continues barking, Trevor regains his composure. Suddenly the dogs attention moves toward the direction of the DARK FIGURE. Amazingly, it stops barking and actually cowers back into the shadows. 
Spooked, Trevor rushes up to: 
EXT. TREVOR'S APT. - NIGHT 
He hurries up to his apartment building and lets himself in. 
INT. TREVOR'S APT. - NIGHT 
He looks out on the street. 
The figure is walking up the building opposite his. It's features are shrouded in shadow, but it is definitely staring at Trevor, who slams the apartment door behind him. He peers out at the street from inside the front hall. 
The figure is gone. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Trevors looks around the apartment. He opens the fridge, it lights up the darkened room. He grabs one of the three items sitting on the wire racks. About to twist off the cap off a cold beer, when a light out his window urges him to investigate. He draws the curtain open and GASPS. 
POV OUT WINDOW: Staring back at him, from a dimly lit window in the apartment building across the street, is the SHADOWY MAN that followed Trevor home. 
The man's face is shrouded in shadows but Trevor can see he's holding something bundled up in a blanket. The light in the window winks out, rendering it dark again. 
Trevor can almost still see the figure somewhere in the darkness still gazing at him. 
Trevor looks a little sick all of a sudden, like he can't breathe. 
THE BELL FROM A DISTANT CATHEDRAL begins to peel. BONG... BONG... BONG... 
Trevor opens his mouth to draw in a breath but instead spits out a massive amount of water! 
BONG... BONG... BONG... 
Trevor falls to the ground, arms and legs thrashing, heaving up mouthfuls of water. Trevor is drowning... 
BONG... BONG... BONG... 
In the puddles of water, we see bits of debris: leaves, pebbles, etc. Finally, a hideous eel-like creature's head pokes out of Trevor's gaping mouth- it escapes and slithers across the floor, up the window sill and out into the night. 
-the ringing bell stops abruptly and he takes in a humongous lungful of sweet oxygen. He then notices he is completely dry. Stunned, he looks about him. 
Trevor is now laying on the easychair, nursing a beer. His videogame is flashing PLAY AGAIN? Whoa. 
The BING-BONG! of his doorbell startles him. 
KIRSTY How does feel to be Mr. Kirsty Hughes for a whole year. 
TREVOR (OFF CAMERA) In a word? Lucrative. 
KIRSTY The best business decision if you ever made I'll bet. 
TREVOR (OFF CAMERA) Enjoyable too. The merger never even felt work for one second. 
KIRSTY You know what the family lawyer told me one our wedding day? 
TREVOR (OFF CAMERA) What? 
KIRSTY Never to put you in my will. 
TREVOR (OFF CAMERA) Really? Why? 
KIRSTY Because you'd be staying with me for me and not because you'd get rich if I died for some reason. 
TREVOR But you had more wisdom than to listen to a false prophet 
KIRSTY There is no wisdom, no insight, no plan (prvb 21:30) 
They share a moment.    Kristy stares at him quietly through the camera. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
KIRSTY (CONT'D) And besides, I thought, to hell with it... it's okay if you only married me for my money. 
TREVOR (OFF CAMERA) Really, why's that? 
KIRSTY I only married you for your body. 
They laugh. The camera now looks away from Kristy and into Trevors suitcase. Trevors pulls out a wrapped present. A small tightly wrappped, perfectly square gift. 
KIRSTY (CONT'D) What are you doing? 
The camera now back on Kristy. And the present comes up into frame. 
TREVOR (OFF CAMERA) Happy Anniversary, Mrs. Gooding. 
KIRSTY For me? Trevor! How romantic! Come here, you. 
The camera begins to wobble as Trevor climbs onto the bed. Its lands sideways, and we see sheets and covers rustling, accompanied by the sound of giggling and kissing. 
The tape ends. SNOW. 
INT. TREVOR'S APT. - NIGHT 
FROM THE COUCH Trevor watches this...Any of this ringing a bell? 
BING BONG! 
Trevor gets up and pops the tape out. 
BING BONG! 
He slowly walks toward the door. He opens it to find a pitch dark hallway. 
TREVOR Hello? Who's out there? 
GWEN suddenly comes out of the darkness clamping her mouth onto his and examining his tonsils with her tongue. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
GWEN Sorry I'm late dear. 
Trevor looks like he'd be more turned on sitting bare-assed on an autopsy table. 
TREVOR Gwen you scared the living shit out of me. 
She pushes him toward the chair and sits him in it. 
Allison stands above him Bic razor in her gloved hand. The bottom half of Trevor's face is covered with shaving cream. 
ALLISON Sorry I thought you were going to stay under longer. 
His face is clean shaven, a little shaving cream remains around his chin. He now has several electrodes attached to his cranium. They're connected to an EEG which BEEPS LOUDLY. The noise bothers Trevor. His eyes dart this way and that. He focuses on the Bic razor. 
TREVOR What's happening to me? What are you doing? 
ALLISON You came in for your EEG. You fell asleep and well, I took the liberty of...I'm sorry. You looked like a wreck Trevor. 
Trevor seems to like the attention. 
TREVOR I just had the most vivid dream. I was sure I was dying. 
ALLISON Well you can relax now you are quite alive. And as long as you're awake, chin up. 
Trevor puts his chin up and Allison continues shaving his neck. Trevor studies her face. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
ALLISON (CONT'D) Well? What do you say Trevor? Que pasa? 
TREVOR (groggily) Let me see. Oh yeah. My head feels like it's going through a meat grinder. I'm not sure if I'm dreaming or... 
ALLISON (interupting) That `poor me' attitude doesn't suit you Trevor. Listen, I don't mean to sound like Pollyanna but things could be worse. There's one good thing about coming so near to the end of ones life. Everything is new and exciting, like your seeing it for the first time. You might see things a litlle differently from now on. 
TREVOR Your insight is enlightening. 
ALLISON No wisdom, no insight, no plan. 
Allison gives him a wink, disarming Trevor. 
TREVOR My wife said that exact same sentence to me the day we got married. She even winked too. 
Allison smiles and puts her hand on his. 
ALLISON Do you use this wife thing to hit on all the interns? 
TREVOR (smiling) No... just you. 
Allison wipes his face clean with a towel. 
ALLISON There. Just like a baby's butt. 
Allison gets up, grabs a clipboard starts filling out a report. Trevor stares at her. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
TREVOR Allison? Why can't remember what happened to my wife? Is it something I'm on that's... that's making me forget? 
ALLISON Easy there Trevor. You need to relax. 
TREVOR No I need to remember. Look whatever it is take me off it. I can handle pain. I can't handle not knowing... 
ALLISON You need to get better first Trevor. Way better. (scribbling in the chart) It's okay to miss somebody. It's okay to still love someone after they're gone. But you've got to quit blaming yourself okay...? Okay? 
Allison looks up and notices Trevor's body has slackened, his eyes empty. She drops the clipboard and starts snapping her fingers over his eyes. 
ALLISON Trevor? 
He is unconscious. A LOUD STEADY BUZZ sounds from one of the machines behind her as blood begins to leak out of Trevor's ear. Allison jumps up and hits call button above Trevor's bed. 
ALLISON (CONT'D) CODE BLUE! 
She yanks Trevor's johnnie down, wheels a defribulator over to his dying body and grabs the paddles. 
ALLISON (CONT'D) It's okay Trevor I'm coming for you. 
Allison rubs the paddles together, presses the paddles against Trevor's chest and- 
INT. TREVOR'S APT. - DAY 
BRET Me? This is your sick joke man. Gwen was murdered here six months ago. The security guard found her all over her office. Her head was in the waste paper basket. Her stomach was in the filing cabinet. Her ass was on the copy machine... 
Trevor is speechless. 
BRET (CONT'D) They never found the sicko who did it... remember? 
Trevor still can't speak. He goes into his computer mailbox and re-opens the file he'd received from ìYou Know Who.î 
He stifles a scream when he sees the jpegs have changed. Sure they're still of Gwen. Pieces of her swimming in puddles of her own blood. Where it once said ìWork harderî it now says ìPolice File.î 
TREVOR (to himself) Jesus Christ... 
Trevor looks behind him to make sure Bret hasn't seen any of this. He's facing his own computer typing away. 
BRET Man are you ever out of the loop. Either that or you've got the worst sense of humor this side of Jeffrey Dahmer. What is your problem anyway? 
Trevor quickly deletes the entire file. Finally... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) 
TREVOR Honestly Bret? I think I lost my mind. And now I'm finding pieces of it, like pieces of a wrecked car, scattered on the side of the road. 
A beat. 
BRET Bud you need to decompress. I told you you came back to work too soon after the accident. 
Trevor says nothing. 
BRET (CONT'D) Hey you know what Trev? I'm going to hook you up man. Here... 
Bret wheels across the cubicle on his chair and hands something to Trevor. It's an oddly designed postcard bearing some sort of voodoo mask. The font is faux-Oriental, the kind they use for Chinese take-out menus. He looks closer. It's an appointment card for an acupuncturist. Sage. 
BRET (CONT'D) This woman will take one look at you and know exactly what you need. 
INT. SAGE'S OFFICE - DAY 
A chart of all the puncture points on the human body is tacked to the wall. 
Trevor lies on the table. SAGE, a gorgeous ethereal Indian woman is at the far end, hovering over the soles of his feet, sticking pins into the appropriate places. She looks up at him slyly. 
SAGE These headaches you've been getting. Do they happen in conjunction with the hallucinations? 
Sage walks over to one of the cabinets, gathering more acupuncture needles. Trevor can't help but notice her shapely body, her feline gait. Sage throws a sultry glance over her shoulder at him, prompting him to finally answer her question. 
TREVOR (unsure of himself) Yes, sort of. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: TREVOR (cont'd) My head's been in constant pain since the... accident. And the pain increases whenever I, uh... slip into another, I don't know what to call them... 
Sage comes back to him, several needles in one hand. She looks into his eyes. 
SAGE Dreams? 
TREVOR I was going to say dimensions. But I guess technically they are dreams. 
SAGE You should always listen to your subconscious. It's trying to tell you something about your waking life. 
Sage begins applying the needles fluidly to his upper body now. 
TREVOR (CONT'D) But I never feel like I'm sleeping. It's sort of, waking narcolepsy. I'll be somewhere and then- (snapping his fingers) -it's like I was never wherever I was to begin with I was really somewhere else entirely. 
Sage puts the last needle in. For the first time Trevor actually feels a releief of pressure in his head. 
TREVOR (cont'd) Ok, whatever that was...do it again. That just set me free of the worlds longest head ache. Is this making any sense? 
SAGE (CONT'D) None whatsoever. Now just relax. Let the needles do the driving. 
A PHONE OUTSIDE THE OFFICE RINGS. Sage looks up at the door. 
SAGE (CONT'D) (patting his cheek) Don't go anywhere. I'll be right back. 
Trevor watches Sage EXIT the office. He lies there a moment, bathing in warm sunshine. He is relaxed, pain free. 
(CONTINUED) 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
TAWNY (CONT'D) Taste this. 
Keeping a hand below his waist Trevor leans toward the spoon, tastes, licks his lips. Then squints. 
TREVOR Wow. That's good. Lots of capers, huh? 
TAWNY For starters. It's also got fennel, asparagus, olives, some more of mother nature's aphrodisiacs... Back in college, me and my roommates used to call it hard- on stew. 
TREVOR Not a very appetizing name. 
TAWNY Have some more. 
Trevor takes another sip of it. 
TAWNY (CONT'D) If you ever smelled this coming from our dorm room, you knew one of us was in there getting laid. 
TREVOR You must have been very proud of yourselves... 
TAWNY It's getting hot in here. 
Tawny summarily unzips her rubber dress and whips it off. 
Trevor is speechless. 
Tawny's body is covered with bites and bruises. 
TREVOR Jesus... who did that to you? 
Tawny BUSTS OUT LAUGHING. 
TAWNY You're kidding right? 
Trevor shakes his head no. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
TAWNY (CONT'D) You did! God, you are funny tonight. 
Tawny approaches Trevor who tenses up. 
TAWNY (CONT'D) Almost like I'm with somebody else. 
Trevor starts looking very ill. 
TREVOR Tawny I think I'm going to be sick. 
TAWNY Well now there's a compliment. 
Trevor grabs his stomach, lurching over. He can't breath. Trevor looks up at Tawny. But it is no longer her. Tawny has changed into something else entirely. 
A CENOBITE. 
The Cenobite rips Trevor's shirt open, and we can see movement within his abdomen. Like a baby kicking. Whatever's in their shoots up expanding Trevor's chest cavity. 
The Cenobite pins Trevor to the wall and hovers in his face as if about to kiss him. 
Before Trevor can scream he is choking. The Cenobite watches with glee as something begins to move up into Trevor's throat, expanding his neck, forcing his jaws open and finally... 
... a BLACK EEL pokes its head out of Trevor's mouth. The Cenobite opens its own mouth and the eel starts to crawl inside it. Meanwhile Trevor's about to pass out from asphyxiation when- 
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY 
-he takes a deep grateful breath through an oxygen mask. The various pieces of monitoring equipment around him are BEEPING and PINGING like slot machines. 
Allison walks around the room pressing buttons that silent each machine one by one, then walks up to the bed, looking surprisingly calm. 
ALLISON Sorry about that. There was a blockage in your oxygen hose. Won't happen again, promise. 
(CONTINUED) 
TREVOR I... think we need to talk, there's something really strange going on... 
TAWNY (a look of recognition) Hey you're the guy from down the hall. 
TREVOR Come on, quit fucking around. Listen it's about... what we did together last night. 
TAWNY (utterly shocked) WHAT?! 
A VERY DEEP VOICE comes from somewhere behind her. 
VOICE Who the fuck is that? 
TAWNY It's that guy from down the hall. He thinks we did something with him last night. 
TREVOR Who's- who's in there with you...? 
Tawny looks aghast. 
TAWNY Are you cracking up or something? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
Suddenly an enormous BRUTE of a MAN, wide as he is tall ENTERS the doorway. He's wearing a black tee, black jeans and, Trevor can't help notice, black nail polish... on fingers and toes. Obviously Tawny's significant other. 
BRUTE What can we do for you, chief? 
TREVOR I... who are you? 
Brute takes a sideward step through the doorway, forcing Trevor back two steps. 
BRUTE You know Tawny, you better know me, pal. 
TREVOR Okay. I don't want any trouble. I was mistaken... I'll see you later. 
BRUTE Much. 
Trevor turns and hurries off. Brute turns to Tawny who shrugs and makes a twirly motion at her temple. The two go back into her apartment. 
INT. TREVOR'S APT. - DAY 
Trevor paces in his apartment telephone to his ear. He lets out a heavy breath and looks at his watch. Finally: 
OPERATOR (V.O.) City police main switchboard how may I direct your call? 
TREVOR You already asked me that ten minutes ago just before you put me on hold. I'm looking for defective- I mean Detective Lange. 
OPERATOR Oh he and his partner just stepped out to lunch, can I-? 
Trevor hangs up. 
INT. BUS - DAY 
Trevor sits at the front of the bus agitated. He folds and unfolds Detective Lange's business card in his hands like some frustrated Origami artist. 
The SIREN from a passing ambulance drills his ears. The irritating sound eventually fades away but the pain in his head is still there. 
The BONGING of a distant cathedral's bell makes him pause. He looks around. 
Toward the rear and sees a familiar old lady knitting a baby's bootie. He looks again. The bootie is bright red and dripping... blood? Trevor follows the strand of bright red wool down to their source: 
A DYING GOAT laying under the seat. It's insides have been ripped out. Its veins and tendons are serving as the old lady's yarn. 
Trevor's eyes bolt back up to the old woman. She continues HUMMING sweetly, her lap speckled with goat's blood. Trevor pulls the wire and an OBNOXIOUS BUZZING goes off. Trevor hurries up to the bus driver as the bus pulls over. 
TREVOR Just open the doors I'll jump off. 
BUS DRIVER Not while the bus is moving, sir. 
Trevor clutches his head in pain and waits for the bus to stop. The doors open. He jumps off, knees nearly buckling from the pain. He looks up as the bus speeds off. 
IN THE REAR WINDOW the little black girl seen earlier pops up. She's holding her little doll. She pushes a clothespin into its head. Blood drips from the puncture. At the same time Trevor feels an incredible pain sear through his head. He squints at the bus again. The little girl is gone. 
INT. LANGE'S OFFICE - DAY 
LARRY (to Trevor's back) I never thought your late wife was the sharpest knife in the drawer. But marrying you was the dumbest thing she ever did! 
On his way out Trevor nearly runs down Larry's ASSISTANT who was just coming IN with a large file. Trevor's gone. 
INT. CAB - DAY 
Trevor looks despondently out the window. The cab stops and Trevor hands some money to the CABBIE up front. 
TREVOR You can go. I'm going to be here a while. 
EXT. BRIDGE - DAY 
Trevor gets out of the cab, which drives off leaving him on the bridge looking down at the water below. 
EXT. BELOW BRIDGE - DAY 
Police tape FLAPS between the trees. Other than that there is no sign of an investigation. Trevor walks out of the woods on the shore, through the police tape and to the water's edge. 
He begins to walk the shore looking out at the still water. He scans the area where the water meets the land, trying to remember. 
Something on the surface few feet away catches his eye. It's a rock sticking up. No it's something else. Trevor walks right up to the water and puts his feet on a couple of large rocks breaking the surface. He bends down and looks at... 
THE CORNER OF A BLACK CUBE. He quickly reaches down, tries to pick it up. It seems to be stuck just below the surface. Trevor pulls harder and finally it gives. Trevor slowly lifts the black cube out of the water and GASPS when he sees- 
-A WHITE WATERLOGGED HAND CLUTCHING IT FROM BELOW! 
Trevor GASPS and lets go. And just as the cube (along with its owner) SPLASH under the surface- 
-ANOTHER WHITE HAND breaks the surface grabbing Trevor's wrist! 
As Trevor Struggles he looks up to see the dark figure standing above him holding a rock over his head. Just as he swings down towards Trevors head- 
smash cut to: 
INT. ALLISON'S OFFICE - DAY 
Trevor jumps scaring the hell out of Allison who has just gotten done taking his pulse. 
ALLISON Jesus I wish you would stop doing that. 
Trevor looks down at himself. He's on an examination table in his normal clothes not a hospital johnnie. That's a good sign. 
TREVOR Allison... 
Trevor tries to put his thoughts together. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
ALLISON Well Trevor? What have you got to say for yourself? Que pasa? 
TREVOR (voice quivering) Allison we have GOT to talk about this medication you've got me on. 
ALLISON I'm all over it. 
Allison shines a penlight in his eye. 
ALLISON (CONT'D) Blink. 
Trevor blinks. Satisfied, Allison sits on the bed next to Trevor and takes his hand. 
ALLISON (CONT'D) Okay. What we're going to do is up the Topomax to two per day instead of one, see if that takes care of these hallucinatory seizures you've been having. The extra Topomax won't interfere with the painkillers either but... You're going to be thrilled to hear this part but we have been told by some patients it affects the memory somewhat... 
TREVOR (weary) Really? Does it affect the memory? 
Allison looks concerned. Then her features soften. 
ALLISON You're one tough cookie, Trevor Gooding. You keep coming back to your corner for a quick fix up then go right back out into the ring for another round. 
TREVOR Some call it resilience. Others, stupidity. 
Allison lets a lapse in the conversation last too long. That look of concern returns as she lingers on his face. She's trying to say something. 
TREVOR (CONT'D) Everything okay Allison? 
TREVOR Yeah. It's like I was a different guy then I am today. I can't remember that guy. I see these women, they think I'm someone else, and I'm not that guy anymore. I'm not sure who Kristy knew. 
ALLISON You were unfaithful, it sounds like your confessing. 
TREVOR I did more then that. 
Allison reaches accross the table for Trevors hand. A quiet moment. 
ALLISON Com'on.   How bout some fresh air? 
EXT. HOSPITAL ROOF - DAY 
Trevor and Allison sit in a couple of chairs looking out at the other rooftops around them. 
TREVOR Lucky for us these chairs happened to be here. 
ALLISON Oh I knew about the chairs already. This is where the emphysema patients come to sneak cigarettes. 
She points to the ground at myriad butts scattered at their feet. Trevor smiles and looks at his hands. 
ALLISON (CONT'D) Don't tell me. Kirsty used to smoke? 
TREVOR No. She just would have loved it up here... Allison when I was under... did I ever talk? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
ALLISON Sure plenty of times. 
TREVOR Was there anything I said that made you stop and wonder, you know, "where did that come from?" 
ALLISON Sure plenty of times. 
TREVOR Well? 
ALLISON Trevor if someone is talking from a sleep state they are obviously dreaming. So practically everything say is going to sound strange. 
TREVOR Did I ever talk about the accident? 
ALLISON No. 
TREVOR Did I ever talk about Kirsty? 
ALLISON No. But at one point you did repeat something though. A phrase. You must have been having this recurring dream, you just kept saying this one thing over and over 
TREVOR What was it? 
ALLISON You said, "Jealousy arouses a husbands fury, and he will show no mercy when he takes revenge." (Proverbs 6:34) Does that mean anything to you Trevor? 
TREVOR It means I have alot more questions. 
Trevor stares off into the distance. 
ALLISON Times up for today. I've got to get back. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
Allison SMILES and pats Trevor's knee. He melts and puts his hand on hers. She slowly takes it away and fixes her hair. 
TREVOR (CONT'D) Sorry. 
ALLISON If it makes you feel better that took every ounce of self control I had. Trevor, I never date patients. 
TREVOR I understand... I won't- 
ALLISON No you don't understand. That's why I've been fighting to get you better. So you wouldn't be a patient anymore. 
TREVOR Why didn't you tell me sooner? I would have switched doctors! 
ALLISON Just get better okay? 
She caresses his face then looks at her watch. 
BRET Frogurt guy's here. They're all out chocolate vanilla swirl or I'd have gotten you one. 
TREVOR I'm sure you would have. 
Bret nods, tosses the frozen yogurt container out and sits down. 
BRET Hey if you're not doing anything I'd like to buy you a beer after work. Be just like old times. 
TREVOR What's the occasion? 
BRET I quit. Today's my last day. 
This hits Trevor like a ton of bricks. 
INT. PUB - DAY 
The place is practically empty. Bret and Trevor play darts and work on a pitcher of beer. Country Western plays on the jukebox. 
BRET I've got a better offer. More time off. A sort of career shift, more in the engineering line of work. 
TREVOR How much time off? 
BRET As much as he feels like. Its a much more pleasurable line of work. 
TREVOR As much as he likes? 
BRET Yahtzee. Were all in this together Trev. Trevor there are people who are doing exactly what we're doing but they don't need to wear a tie, punch a clock or have some tight assed supervisor breathing down their necks. Its all about the pleasure Trevor! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
TREVOR So you're just packing it up just like that? 
BRET Almost that fast. I got a few loose ends to tie up first. Came into a shitload of money recently. I've always wanted to go to take a trip. We're just gonna walk into the airport and decide right then and there. 
TREVOR Yeah? You and who else? 
BRET Someone special. 
Bret throws a dart with extra mph. It misses the board entirely and hits the wall. Trevor winces in pain suddenly. He touches his head and looks at his fingers. Fresh blood. 
FLASHBACK 
Trevor in the car in the water. Thrashing about, he bleeding from his head in the flashback as well. Where's Kristy? He looks in the passenger seat. She's gone. 
Trevor takes the cube from the man with the ring. He fumbles with the puzzle box in the darkness. 
CU box.   It starts to move. 
Trevor driving with Kristy, She's going down on him while he's driving. 
KIRSTY Okay pull over. 
TREVOR (looking at his watch) But... I thought... 
Trevor waits a moment to see if she's kidding. 
KIRSTY (through clenched teeth) PULL OVER NOW. 
The car comes to a stop. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
Trevor gets the goods while he watches himself in the rear view mirror. 
Someone approaches. Trevor zips up, pulls Kristy up out of his lap. Its a cenobite. 
Trevor screams and opens the door of the car to make a frantic exit. He dive out onto the pavement and looks back. All is quiet. He's alone a quiet road. 
He stands up and into an eerie world of slow motion . Trevor looks up the road and back to find- 
A beautiful vision of Allison walking toward him. Walking gracefully, she approaches Trevor. Raises her hand to his face. Trevor smiles, then slowly looks back towards the car. 
CONTINUED: 
SAGE It was an analogy. Your soul is locked up inside you. You need to free it Trevor. You've blocked it from the healing process. That's what we need to do now. Heal your soul. And to do that I you have to give in utterly and without any hesitation or doubt. Do you know what I mean by giving in? It's about trust. Do you trust me implicitly? 
TREVOR I don't even know what's real and what isn't how can I trust anyone? 
SAGE You can trust me. Your wife is dead and you need to move past that. And the only way to move past something completely is to go straight through it, not around it. Surrender yourself to your wife's death. Let it chew you up and spit you back out on the other side. It's the only way you can become whole again. 
Sage looks Trevor dead in the eye. 
SAGE (CONT'D) Are you ready? 
TREVOR I surrender... 
Trevor closes his eyes 
A MONTAGE 
of Sage dimming the lights so that the room is nice and dark... placing needles into Trevor's body... his shoulders... his chest... his neck... his legs... his face... 
Trevor finally opens his eyes to find... 
... he's completely naked on Sage's table! And she's making love to his body, which is now filled with needles! 
TREVOR (CONT'D) Wait... what the hell is this... 
SAGE (whispering) Surrender yourself... surrender yourself... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
She holds up a small chunk of ice and begins rubbing it on Trevor's chest. He catches his breath at the cold and begins to shiver. 
INT. CAR - DAY 
Trevor wakes up shivering. He is in the passenger seat, head resting against a baby blanket. A hand touches his... 
... Kirsty's. 
TREVOR Kirsty... Kirsty? 
KIRSTY It's okay it was just a nightmare that's all. 
Trevor looks at Kirsty. She is breathtakingly beautiful. 
TREVOR You're alive... 
KIRSTY Yes. Now go back to sleep. You're driving the rest of the way to gramma's remember? 
Trevor looks in the back and for the first time sees an INFANT GIRL sleeping in a car seat behind him. 
KIRSTY (CONT'D) Trevor I've decided we have got to agree on a name before we reach my mother's. This poor kid's going to be starting preschool as student x if we don't make up our minds. So, I've been thinking, what about Daisy? 
TREVOR (looking at the baby) It's perfect. 
KIRSTY Well that was easy all of a sudden. 
Trevor looks back at Kirsty. 
TREVOR Kirsty... I'm glad you're alive. 
THE SIREN FROM AN APPROACHING AMBULANCE GETS LOUDER AND LOUDER, piercing Trevor's ears. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Trevor winces in pain and blocks his ears from the noise. Kirsty looks at him, puzzled. He can only read her lips: "Honey what's wrong? Honey?" 
INT. AMBULANCE - NIGHT 
Trevor's eye rivet open again. A PARAMEDIC is snapping his fingers in front of them. Another paramedic is readying a hypodermic. 
PARAMEDIC Can you hear me? Just nod. 
NURSE There there Trevor. Get some sleep. 
Trevor tenses when the nurse smiles. 
NURSE (CONT'D) If you need anything give myself or any of the nurses a call okay? We're- 
TREVOR Don't tell me. ëWe're all here for you Trevor' right? Go ahead say it! You know you want to! 
The nurse looks taken aback. 
NURSE What the hell are you talking about...? 
Trevor suddenly jumps up yanking electrodes and IV tubes from his body. The nurse is back to normal and very disconcerted. 
NURSE (CONT'D) Trevor! Mr. Gooding lay back down- 
Trevor runs out of the woman mowing the woman down in his tracks. 
INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAYS - NIGHT 
Trevor rushes down the halls of the hospital nearly knocking down Dr. Ambrose. 
DR. AMBROSE Hey! 
Trevor races as fast as his feet can carry him easily losing Dr. Ambrose. 
INT. OTHER WING - NIGHT 
Trevor runs down a corridor through another doorway and into another wing of the hospital entirely. He arrives at the door to Allison's office and throws it open. It's actually a janitor's closet. 
EXT. HOSPITAL ROOF - NIGHT 
Dressed in janitorial garb, Trevor bursts open the stairwell door and comes out on the roof. 
An OLD MAN in a johnnie is sitting in one of the chairs not too far away. An oxygen tube trails from his nose to an oxygen tank at his feet. 
OLD MAN (wheezing) Okay ya caught me. 
He brings a cigarette to his lips and takes a long drag. 
OLD MAN (CONT'D) Least let me finish will ya? Got one puff left. 
TREVOR I don't work here. 
OLD MAN Music to my ears. 
The old man lights a fresh cigarette with the one he's just finished. 
Trevor turns to go back and THERE'S ALLISON standing in the doorway. 
ALLISON Trevor. I heard you were looking for me. Is everything all right? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
TREVOR Allison! Am I glad to see you! (changing his tone) No... everything's not right. Not at all. 
ALLISON Come here. 
Allison holds him. The old smoker turns and watches with curiosity. 
TREVOR Allison I think I did some very, very bad things. I mean very bad. 
ALLISON Trevor things like this happen to people who experience temporary memory loss. Everybody does things they regret. You just couldn't remember doing these things and now you are so it's a shock to the system. I'm telling you. You will never get better if you keep blaming yourself for your wife's death. 
TREVOR Maybe I wasn't responsible for the car accident... 
The old man calls out to Trevor wheezily. 
OLD MAN Hey buddy! 
TREVOR (ignoring him) ... but I'm starting to think I was... I was going to... 
OLD MAN Hey buddy! 
INT. CUBIC ROUTE ACTUARIAL RESEARCH, BULLPEN - NIGHT 
Trevor is thrust into the interior of his office building. Everyone's gone for the day. The only light is coming in from streetlights outside. Trevor races past the cubicles running out into a hallway. 
He looks down one end then the other... where he sees an office light is on. He cautiously approaches the office. 
He looks inside. 
INT. GWEN'S OFFICE - DAY 
Gwen's hacked up body is strewn about the office. Her arms are atop the filing cabinet. Legs under her desk. Ass on the copier. 
Trevor hears someone coming. He looks down the hall to see A FLASHLIGHT BEAM TURN THE CORNER, blinding him. It's bearer begins running toward Trevor. 
Trevor bolts the other direction heading for the exit. He pushes the door open and slams it behind him only he's not still outside yet... 
INT. TAWNY'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Tawny lies on the bed, dead, tongue sticking out of her neck, ribcage violated. 
Trevor hears someone coming toward the bedroom can see the flashlight beam jittering as its bearer approaches. 
Trevor rushes toward the window, opens it and leaps out onto the fire escape. 
EXT. APT. BUILDING - NIGHT 
Trevor's about to climb down the fire escape when he is bathed in the flashlight's beam from inside. Trevor looks down and sees a garbage dumpster full of trash bags below. He jumps. 
Trevor sails down three stories and lands in the dumpster. He climbs out and runs to the street as fast as he can. He races down the sidewalk trying to get his bearings at the same time. 
Hearing footsteps from behind Trevor turns to see: 
The Stranger in the Window not half a block behind Trevor, keeping Trevor's pace. Then... Trevor stops. And turns. 
The Stranger stops as well. This has never happened before. Trevor shouts down the empty street. 
TREVOR (CONT'D) WHO ARE YOU! 
His voice echoes off the darkened buildings. 
The Stranger stands there. Trevor begins walking toward him, blood in his eyes. The Stranger backs away. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Trevor bolts into a run and the Stranger takes off running the other way. 
The stranger darts into an alley. 
INT. ALLEY - NIGHT 
Trevor runs into the alley, seeing no signs of the stranger. The end of the alley is pitch black. 
TREVOR WHERE'S MY WIFE?! 
Trevor hears something at the end of the alley. He grabs a broken bottle out of a garbage can and heads toward the darkness. Trevor's teeth are bared now. 
TREVOR (CONT'D) WHERE'S MY WIFE!? 
Something GLISTENS in the dark just before the razor sharp edge of a switchblade touches his left jugular. Trevor freezes. OUT OF THE SHADOWS comes... BRET. 
TREVOR (CONT'D) Bret... what the fuck...? 
BRET Tonight was supposed to be the night, Trevor. Remember? I couldn't believe you went through five dart games and didn't even joke about it. 
TREVOR Bret. What the hell is going on? 
BRET We were gonna be millionaires you said. Nobody'd suspect a thing. I had never even met her. No connection. Then you went and had that fucking car accident. 
TREVOR Bret you are making no sense whatsoever. 
BRET I followed her Trevor. I got to know her life. And what a boring one it was. Six a.m. gym, nine a.m. trendy coffee shop, noon bookstore, one soap operas, four o'clock news, five wait for Trevor to come home. And wait and wait and wait. Nine o'clock get ready for bed. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: BRET (cont'd) Ten o'clock fall asleep in front of the TV. She did that every day I followed her. Every single day. While you were out fucking your concubines. Every day I felt more and more bad for her, man. And hated you more and more. 
The trio comes to the line up room. 
INT. LINE UP ANTEROOM - NIGHT 
Trevor is shoved into the cramped booth-like room with four other strange looking MEN who all stare at him. Silence for a moment then: 
A LOUD BUZZ is heard and the door on the other side of room opens. 
COP#1 Single file. 
Trevor follows the other men. The MAN just ahead of Trevor turns to him. 
MAN We're all here for you Trevor. 
COP#1 NO TALKING! 
INT. LINE UP ROOM - NIGHT 
Trevor walks IN with the rest of the gentlemen. Hugging the nearest wall they go up a small set of stairs onto a stage. Trevor hears Lange's VOICE overhead. 
LANGE'S VOICE Stop and face the mirror! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
The five men do as they're told, facing a large two-way mirror on the opposite wall. An awkward moment. 
LANGE'S VOICE (CONT'D) Thank you! 
The door to the room opens again and Trevor turns, leading the other men back through the anteroom. 
INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT 
The cops hustle Trevor out into the hallway. The next door down opens and out come two more detectives and... TAWNY'S BOYFRIEND, the brute, looking fit to be tied. He sees Trevor and fills with rage. 
BRUTE I hope they fry your ass mutherfucker! 
He lunges at Trevor. It takes the detectives he's with and two more cops to keep him from pummeling Trevor. As Trevor's lead away the brute begins to sob uncontrollably. 
BRUTE (CONT'D) (to Trevor) YOU'RE GONNA BURN IN HELL!! 
COP#1 Got quite a fan club don't you, hotshot? 
INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT 
Trevor sits at a tape recorder. Lange sits across from him. 
TREVOR For the last time. I honestly don't know how any of them died... 
Lange stands, squirting antihistamine in his nose. He nods at Trevor and WALKS OUT. No sooner has the door closed when it opens again and Givens walks IN. Givens gets right in Trevor's face. 
GIVENS Now I want you to tell me what you remember happening- in your own words- exactly the way you told Detective Lange. But this time I want you to make one small adjustment. 
TREVOR What's that? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Givens whirls around revealing Lange's face on the back of his head! 
LANGE DON'T FUCKING LIE TO ME! 
Trevor thinks a moment. He is absolutely numb. He smiles a little insanely. 
TREVOR I did it. I killed them all. I confess. 
INT. POLICE STATION HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Still handcuffed Trevor is escorted toward the detention area by the cops in the sunglasses. He's silently praying he'll wake up from this one somehow. No such luck. Trevor and the cops round a corner and there's Lange running up to them. 
LANGE (to the cops) Quick detour through the morgue boys. 
Lange leads them to a set of elevators. 
THE TV SCREEN DISSOLVES to Trevor in bed with yet another woman... and another... and another... 
BACK TO: 
INT. MORGUE - NIGHT 
That fatal BELL begins to TOLL. With each peel the walls of the morgue shakes. It's walls begin to rumble and crack. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
PINHEAD Even a mind as narcissistic as yours must have wondered: What unspeakable acts was your wife committing behind YOUR back? 
EXT. WOODS - NIGHT 
LOW ANGLE UP AT: Kirsty, Trevor's lovely wife, raising a rock above her. 
KIRSTY (to camera) Goodbye you miserable sonofabitch! 
And SLAMMING a rock down on us. 
bacK TO: 
INT. MORGUE - NIGHT 
TREVOR What's under that sheet...? 
PINHEAD You probably don't remember the night we played. Your first year as husband and wife. 
flASH BACK: 
INT. TREVOR'S APT., BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Trevor and a very pregnant Kirsty sit on their bed, passing the cube back and forth. Trevor's the one with the magic touch. The cube begins to open in his hands. Kirsty's eyes light up as she watches... 
PINHEAD (V.O.) It must have seemed like we were uninvited guests crashing your little celebration. 
ON the walls as shadows begin to flail in pain and panic. OFF SCREEN SCREAMS are heard as blood begins to shower the walls of the bedroom. 
PINHEAD (V.O.) But someone was expecting us Trevor. And everything went according to plan. 
baCK TO: 
INT. MORGUE - NIGHT 
PINHEAD We were about to come for Kirsty. When we were offered a deal. We don't usually consider bargains but this one was too good to pass up. A tribute to the resourcefulness of a parent hellbent on protecting its spawn. The deal we were offered was this: three more souls in exchange for the life of the unborn child inside Kirsty. The three souls had already been picked out. Needless to say we were very impressed. 
The lights dim. Drawers behind Pinhead begin to open. We see Gwen's body, Tawny's, Sage's, Bonnie's. 
PINHEAD (CONT'D) Two of your favorite companions, most supple and delicious as you already know. And the man you had at one time conspired to kill Kirsty with. Until you found out she was with child. 
smASH CUT TO: 
QUICK IMAGES of Gwen, Tawny, and Bret being rent to pieces by the Cenobites, SCREAMING in vain. 
INT. MORGUE - NIGHT 
PINHEAD (CONT'D) They were all real screamers too. We had a blast. And there was one more. You've seen many things you wished you hadn't. Many nightmares from which you never awoke. They were all clues in our little puzzle. Can you guess now Trevor? Can you guess the fifth soul chosen for us to torment in this little agreement? 
The lights flicker overhead, reddening with each strobe. Hundreds of those little sewer monsters come slithering out of the cracks in the walls, racing toward Trevor. He doesn't care. 
TREVOR WHAT'S UNDER THE SHEET? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
PINHEAD (smiling) Welcome to the worst nightmare of them all, Trevor. Reality. 
Pinhead grabs the sheet and whips it back. 
Trevor's jaw drops in disbelief. 
IT'S TREVOR'S BODY. It is blue, bloated and mutilated. The corpse's skull has a massive crack in it. 
DR. AMBROSE Makes you wonder what he was up to between the time he disappeared and when he died. 
Allison walks right up to the corpse's face. 
ALLISON Well? What do you say Trevor? Que pasa? 
DR. AMBROSE (shivering) Allison what on earth possesses you to converse with cadavers? 
SAGE (looking at Trevor's corpse) It's simple, Dr. Ambrose. What if there is no afterlife? What happens when we die? Do we just stay stuck inside your bodies for eternity watching ourselves decompose? 
AMBROSE I'm not following this... 
ALLISON Well if that's the case... wouldn't you want someone to talk to you like a normal human being one last time? 
AMBROSE You two are creeping me out. And I'm a coroner. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) 
Allison fixes a stray lock of hair on Trevor's forehead. 
QUICK CUTS: Allison slipping a tag on Trevor's toe; sliding Trevor's body into the morgue drawer; her hand turning the lock on the drawer. 
ALLISON (O.S.) Adios amigo. 
INT. LANGE'S OFFICE - DAY 
Lange sits across from Kirsty, who signs some paperwork on Lange's desk. 
KIRSTY I would have come in sooner but I had an important errand to run last night. Out of town. Figures you'd find his body the minute I decide to go off somewhere. 
LANGE Well you made it down here that's the important part. Thank you for your patience Mrs. Gooding. 
She nods teary eyed. She slides the paperwork across his desk and gets up to leave. 
LANGE (CONT'D) One last thing... When they found him he was holding something. Not to get too graphic but they had to wrench it from his hand. 
Lange reaches under his desk then stands revealing: 
THE CUBE inside a ziploc bag. Lange and Kirsty exchange a knowing glance. 
LANGE (CONT'D) Figured you might want it. 
KIRSTY Of course. That was my... last anniversary present to him. 
LANGE A token to remember him by now. Goodbye Mrs. Gooding. 
She takes the cube. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
KIRSTY Thank you detective. 
Lange takes out his nasal sprayer as she walks OUT. She closes the door behind her and Lange looks up at the closed door. He sticks the sprayer up his nose. 
INT. POLICE STATION HALLWAY - DAY 
Kirsty walks toward the exit. On her way she passes a trash can. She discretely tosses the cube into it and rubs her hands together. 
EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY 
The birds are chirping. The sun is shining. Kirsty Gooding walks out the door and takes a breath of fresh air. She skips down the steps of the police station toward the street. She stops in the middle of the sidewalk looking both ways. 
A SHADOW COMES up behind her. It's the STRANGER Trevor had seen out his window. He grabs her shoulder startling Kirsty. She turns to see LARRY ELLIS, shit-eating grin on his face. He's holding an eight month old BABY. The one he was drawing. 
LARRY Looking for someone, Kirsty? 
KIRSTY (taking the baby) You bet I was. 
Kirsty plants a multitude of smothering kisses on the laughing child as A NANNY comes up behind Larry pushing a stroller. Kirsty gently places the baby in it. 
KIRSTY (CONT'D) (to Nanny) Okay we're on our way. Remember her-

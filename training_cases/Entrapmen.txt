"Entrapment", early, by Ronald Bass 
ENTRAPMENT 
Ronald Bass First Draft Screenplay December 2, 1996 
Story by: Ronald Bass and Michael Herzberg 
EXT. HANCOCK TOWER, CHICAGO - LATE NIGHT 
Lake Shore Drive.  Four o'clock in the morning.  Minimal traffic, minimal life.  As MAIN TITLES BEGIN, we PAN UP the face of... 
...Hancock Tower.  Up, up, forty floors, sixty, eighty, very dark up here, street sounds fading fast, and as CREDITS CONTINUE we can just make out... 
...a dark FIGURE.  Like a spider.  Inching its way up the steel surface of the 98th floor, and we CLOSE to see... 
The THIEF.  All in black, nearly invisible, with a sleek visored helmet that conceals the face.  Two long, oblong backpacks, climb- ing ropes and harness across back and shoulders, tools at the belt. Moving STRAIGHT UP the face of the skyscraper.  How is it possible? CLOSER still to see... 
...the piton-like BOLTS are electromagnetic, CLANKING to the steel to support weight.  A button releases the magnetic charge when the bolt is pulled up by cords to a higher position.  The Thief is remarkably strong and agile, scaling the wall with fluid precision, until... 
...our summit.  A softly-lit, glass-walled PENTHOUSE on the 100th floor.  Subtle spots which bathe paintings, sculptures, in a cavernous coldly-decorated space. 
Swiftly, deftly, the Thief rigs a suction-mounted HARNESS to the steel casing above a massive window.  Pulleys, metal caribiner clips, yellow Kevlar ropes.  So superbly practiced, the rigging is placed in seconds, huge SUCTION CUPS pressed to the surface of the glass.  The Thief reaches to a metal rectangle at the top of the rigging, touches a button, a motor WHINES, the ropes TIGHTEN and the window... 
...POPS FREE, hangs SUSPENDED by the Kevlar ropes which amazingly sustain its awesome weight.  The huge pane shudders in the wind, and the Thief slips... 
...INTO the Penthouse.  Nearby, an ALARM BOX softly BEEPS its 60-second warning to the pulsing of a green light, and the Thief attaches a small computerized DEVICE which runs a series of possible CODES at dazzling speed on its display panel, until... 
...the right one STOPS.  Illuminated in red.  The beeping, the green light, go OFF.  The device is removed. 
Back to the window, air rushing in, attach a similar suction- mounted harness from the inside, all exquisitely engineered to rig in seconds, press new suction cups to the inside of the dangling window pane.  A small remote control clicker... 
...RELEASES the outside suction cups.  The window's weight now supported by the interior rigging.  The outside equipment pulled INTO the apartment in a single tug.  The WHINE of a motor, and the pane pulls UP, the Thief expertly POPPING it into place. 
No trace of entry. 
Rapidly folding the rigging into an astonishingly compact bundle, the Thief SCANS... 
...the profusion of priceless art.  The paintings run to Otto Dix, Franz Marc, Marcel Duchamp.  One statue an obvious Rodin.  The soft lighting makes walls seem invisible, everything with an infinity perspective in mind.  An obsidian slab dining table that seems to end at the horizon. 
The Thief has packed the rigging away, taken out a large cylin- drical TUBE bearing a label we can't read.  Knows the way, quickly through the spectacular apartment, past oils by early German expressionists, Russian futurists, a Rothko, a Kandinsky, a Francis Bacon.  The Thief has no interest in these, and as CREDITS CONTINUE, we enter... 
...a powder room.  A lime-green poured concrete sink, a copper- plated commode, and across from these... 
...a single PAINTING.  Unlike the others, clearly an Old Master. A 17th century city on the water, churches, spires, an ancient bridge.  The Thief wastes no time, unceremoniously... 
...CUTS the painting from its frame with sure, perfect strokes. Rolls it quickly in acid-free paper.  Opens the cylindrical tube, pulling out... 
...another CANVAS which we cannot see.  Deftly unrolls this, fitting it carefully into the stolen painting's now-empty frame. Re-hangs it.  Stares for a beat through the opaque helmet visor. Approves.  Slips the rolled-up stolen canvas into the empty tube. Leaves.  Before we follow, we shift angle to see the replacement canvas... 
A cheerful acrylic portrait.  Bozo the Clown. 
WITH the Thief now, moving fast, into a panelled library.  There is a CHUTE built into the wall, a brass lid with the words U.S. MAIL. The Thief pops the labeled tube DOWN the chute.  Gone.  Steps... 
...onto a bookshelf, reaches up to punch out an overhead grating, and... 
Disappears into the vent.  Reaching back to refit the grating seamlessly into place. 
INT. VENT 
Halogen flashlight leading the way, our Thief shimmies down the narrow space, arriving at... 
...an open vertical AIR SHAFT, BLASTING air straight up the 100 floor height of the skyscraper, with frightening FORCE.  Calmly, the Thief clips on a different harness, unzips a nylon cover from the backpack, and simply... 
LEAPS DOWN the air shaft, startling the shit out of us, as, for an instant... 
...the force of the updraft seems to HOLD the Thief in place, suspended above 100 stories of nothingness.  Then suddenly, the Thief... 
...DROPS SHARPLY, an exhilarating moment of absolute FREE FALL, until a cord is tugged and... 
...a nylon PARACHUTE OPENS with a pop.  We watch the Thief drifting lazily down.  A ride any kid would pay big money for... 
EXT. HANCOCK TOWER - LATE NIGHT 
Our original exterior VIEW of the skyscraper's penthouse.  REVERSE ANGLE now to see in far distance... 
...the dense forest of silhouetted OFFICE TOWERS of downtown Chicago against the night sky, and we ZOOM TOWARD them, covering miles in three seconds, to CLOSE on... 
...the highest floor of the SEARS TOWER, and THROUGH an unlit window to see... 
...a TELESCOPE.  A silhouetted FIGURE looking through it.  SNAP to... 
VIEW through the scope's lens.  An amazingly CLOSE detail of the Hancock Tower Penthouse.  The scope now PANS DOWN the length of the Tower, to... 
The street.  The Thief climbing onto a battered old Lambretta. Calm as you please.  And as the scooter glides off... 
We HEAR our unseen voyeur WALK AWAY from our telescope.  A door OPENS somewhere, and as CREDITS CONCLUDE, it... 
Closes.  Softly. 
INT. WEBBER ASSURANCE - DAY 
A basement corridor.  Long, bare, dimly lit.  Silent.  We're in the bowels of somewhere.  A startling CLANK, like a prison cell unlocking.  A FIGURE enters the corridor, coming this way, on the hurried side of brisk. 
HECTOR CRUZ is 42, tanned, fit, graying hair swept back in a Pat Riley do.  He wears Riley's Armani, too.  Maybe this guy coaches. Heels ECHO until he reaches a plain door with discreet lettering... 
NO ADMITTANCE FOR ANY REASON.  There is a dull silver rectangle below the words.  He holds his hand up to it... 
Nothing happens.  Shit.  Dries his palm on his perfectly-creased slacks.  One more time.  CLICK.  Enters... 
INT. SITUATION ROOM - DAY 
GIN Because they couldn't do it. 
His slow smile.  This fucking kid. 
CRUZ He's been out of the business. For ten years. 
GIN Maybe not.  No one ever proved, hell, even arrested him, for stealing anything.  But we all know he was numero ichiban for thirty years.  Why not forty? 
She's serious. 
CRUZ Why?  Because of the Bozo switch? Guys have been copying his pack- rat signature for decades.  Maybe the thief wanted it to look like MacDougal. 
She doesn't even answer.  Just touches her panel, and one of the data screens BLOWS UP to huge size.  It is... 
GIN A list of his private collection. Complete to three acquisitions last Thursday. 
Names SCROLLING up endlessly, next to titles, descriptions, estimated retail and black market values.  Turner, Corot, Thomas Coles, DeKooning, Klimt, Cezannes, Odilon Redon, Braques, Mary Cassatt... 
CRUZ No Vermeer.  Nothing close. 
GIN Don't be a putz.  This is his legitimate collection, which he buys.  Presentable for any search warrant surprise party. 
Names keep rolling, Degas, Paul Klee.  Amazing. 
GIN What he rips off, he fences.  And the money feeds his portfolio of investments, which are daring, savvy, and obscenely succesf... 
CRUZ Oh, I get it.  He has no interest in Vermeers, so that proves he stole one.  By that logic, he oughta be a suspect most of the time. 
She shakes her head, sadly. 
GIN You love to embarrass yourself. 
Touches her panel.  The big screen now shows a grainy VIDEOTAPE of... 
GIN The auction.  Where our client bought the painting... 
We see the Great Room of an English Country estate.  Perhaps a hundred attend.  Genteel to the max. 
GIN (O.S.) Ashcroft Hall, Buckinghamshire, four weeks ago. 
The tape PANS five PAINTINGS on the block.  We recognize our VERMEER, the city of Delft, the canal, the bridge.  The view PULLS BACK to include the crowd, and... 
FREEZES.  One tiny section is circled.  And BLOWS UP twenty feet. high, so blurry as to be unrecognizable.  Then, SNAPS to amazing resolution.  The image of... 
GIN (O.S., murmur) Anyone we know? 
...ANDREW MacDOUGAL, perhaps 60, as charismatic and shamelessly virile a face as one can recall.  Etched with character and worldly experience, lit by a twinkle behind the razor-keen gaze.  Tall, wide shoulders, massive hands.  This guy would be more fun to fuck than fight.  By a lot. 
CRUZ So he was there. 
GIN Staking it out.  Why bid, when you can mark the buyer, and jack it within the month? 
She leans WAY back in the molded chair.  Lifts her long legs up onto the console.  They end in slender bare feet.  The toes wriggle. 
GIN At this moment, he is winging on JAL flight 307 to Narita, ostensibly to attend a prestigious auction at the Hotel Akura, which will include a mixed media collage/oil by Georges Braques, on which he supposedly has his eye. 
CRUZ But you know better. 
GIN Bet your ass.  At Vegas odds. 
Touches the panel.  The big screen now holds three faces, three names. 
GIN (O.S.) Research reveals three known fences, still at large, who are believed to have brokered Vermeers to black market buyers.  Sandrine Palmer is hospitalized in Malta with ovarian cancer. 
One face and name disappears.  Two remain.  KOICHI NARUHITO. HIROYUKI YAMAJI. 
GIN The other two.  Live in Tokyo. 
A tiny, dry, adorable, shrug.  Which says, bingo. 
CRUZ And you did all this since 4:30 this morning. 
Grinning small at each other.  She can't help that hers is hot. She never can. 
CRUZ (murmur) Plus.  You were polite to a stranger. 
One of those moments when his attraction to her is too obvious to ignore.  Best to defuse by pretending it's a joke... 
GIN (soft and playful) Sounds like you're sorry you're already a friend. 
Said as banter between pals.  Which doesn't make her wrong. 
INT. HOTEL OKURA, TOKYO - NIGHT 
Auction in progress in the huge traditional LOBBY, where bonsai trees, paper lanterns and elaborate painted screens counterpoint the sleek, international, big-money crowd.  Everyone milling, drinking, schmoozing, networking in a babble of languages, as up on the raised platform... 
...the AUCTIONEER has a new piece on the block, a 6th Century temple scroll, from the Asuka period.  It is exquisite, and bidding seems to be big time, from the rapidly escalating numbers on the overhead DIGITAL DISPLAY, which reveals bidding status in thirty currencies simultaneously. As we PAN the hall, we see... 
...all non-Asians either wearing headphones, or acompanied by personal translators at their elbow, to follow the rapid-fire auctioneer. 
Except one. 
ANDREW MacDOUGAL stands alone in black tie.  Tall and rugged and polished and focused, and, well, pretty gorgeous.  He is bidding on the scroll, indicated only by subtle gestures with his program and the repeated finger-stabs of the auctioneer in our direction. 
WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S., subtitled Japanese) Don't do it. 
PULL BACK slightly to reveal Gin, who has stepped to his shoulder. She is barely recognizable to us in her satiny slip of a pale golden gown that drapes her frame perfectly.  Breathtaking would be an insult. 
MacDougal doesn't turn, doesn't seem to even hear her.  Just raises his program to up the bid. 
GIN (softly, subtitled Japanese) You're already over value.  By 15 percent. 
A held beat.  His glance lifts beyond her shoulder. 
MAC Excuse me. 
And walks off toward a sleek custom TOURING CAR just pulling up. She goes after him. 
GIN I didn't know Porsche made things like this. 
MAC Well, they don't... 
Tipping the valet.  Sliding in... 
MAC ...as a rule. 
Shutting the door.  Through the open window, she hands something from her bag.  A plastic rectangle which OPENS into a slide viewer. She presses the light ON.  He looks at the slide. 
GIN Recognize that? 
No reaction. 
GIN My seller is in Shinjuku, we can go there tonight. 
She leans closer. 
GIN He wants 4.6 million.  I can get it for three. 
He hands it back.  Looks in her eyes. 
MAC No, you can't. 
And TAKES OFF.  Her jaw drops slightly, but in one fluid motion... 
She's hailed a cab. 
INT. IMPERIAL HOTEL BAR - LATER 
Graceful, timeless room, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright in the '20s.  Burnished.  Elegant.  Way cool.  A place to drink, to deal, to dream.  PAN down the polished surface of the bartop, til we come to... 
...a tropical DRINK.  Cute little umbrella, tilted back toward the room.  ROTATE ANGLE to see... 
...INSIDE the umbrella, something small, something mechanical.  A woman's HAND ADJUSTS the point of the umbrella ever so slightly, and we PAN UP her arm to see... 
...Gin.  Still in her gown.  She is reading, with half-glasses, and one of the bows curls around her ear, which we CLOSE on to hear... 
...static.  Gin adjusts the drink umbrella, which is a directional mike, and hears... 
MAC (O.S.) ...only it's not bloody football! 
SNAP to Mac's table, well across the room.  Drinking giant beers with a large, really fat Japanese guy in a costly; if wrinkled, suit.  The hulk listens with stone attention to Mac's rant, as if he actually gave a shit. 
MAC (O.S.) ...it's just that crap Americans call 'football', like you could call your ass a butterscotch scone and have it be one! 
The guy nods seriously.  Maybe he's a Sumo dude. 
MAC Why you'd want to bring that foolishness to Japan, you're just pissing your investment down a bungee hole. 
SUMO GUY (major accent) You got Cubano this trip? 
That he does.  Mac pulls out a leather cigar holder, and passes it over.  Flat against one side is an ENVELOPE, which Sumo Guy PALMS skillfully, slipping it seamlessly INTO his pocket as he withdraws a small MATCH BOX.  Takes out one long cigar, lights up... 
MAC Seriously, put the money into pharmaceuticals or prostitution, something stable. 
The big guy pushes the cigar holder and match box back toward Mac. Opening the box, Mac sees one match and a small MICROCHIP fastened to the cardboard.  Lights up.  Slides the match box in his pocket. 
MAC Garbage, perhaps.  Or industrial plastics. 
ANGLE...Gin still engrossed in her reading.  A figure leans down next to her.  She startles, slightly.  So surprised to see... 
MAC My favorite thing in life. Coincidence. 
She gives him the great smile. 
GIN I'm staying here, what's your excuse? 
And now he smiles.  First time ever.  A little chilling, the way he does it. 
MAC Staying here, as well.  You are in room...? 
GIN (half a beat) One thirty-eight. 
In one motion, he flags the bartender... 
MAC Will you send a half-bottle of Chateau d'Yquem '67 to Room 138, please?  And some berries and chocolates for the lady to enjoy it with. 
He presses some currency into the barkeep's hand.  Turning back... 
MAC Actually, I was just across the room, dickering with a gentleman over the purchase of an interesting Spitzweg.  Until I determined the painting was apparently stolen... 
Oh.   She's shocked.  He agrees... 
MAC Goes against my grain.  The DeKooning in your slide, the 4.6 million you can get for 3.  Can you get it for 2 and a half? 
She looks in his eyes. 
GIN Sure. 
And as if he believed her... 
MAC My checkbook is in my safe.  You wait here. 
His smile evaporates.  He is gone before she can say... 
A black chamber.  We can scarcely make out the endless rows of shelving, the air purifying equipment, the conveyor belt entering through its air lock, as machinery folds each priceless microchip in foil wrappers, stacks them on shelves.  Through the gasket... 
...Mac TUMBLES into view, swinging himself neatly DOWN to the floor, and in a single motion, he is already FLASHING a neon-green pen light along the shelves of microchips.  We see now the wrappers are different colors, with different Kanji characters, and Mac is definitely looking for something special, until... 
...he's found it.  A single row, 35 chips, nothing special from here, but Mac... 
...WHIPS out something coiled, SNAPS it to full length, revealing a strip of shiny black SATIN CLOTH.  Three feet long, little more than an inch wide.  Carefully, Mac lays the strip down directly OVER the row of microchips.  And when he lifts it UP again... 
...the chips have ADHERED to the underside of the cloth.  In one deft SNAP of his wrist, he COILS the cloth again, like a yo-yo. Turns to leave, and... 
Oh, yeh. 
Tosses a small SACK of something where the chips used to be.  TIM'S CASCADE BRAND POTATO CHIPS.  SEA SALT AND VINEGAR FLAVOR. 
INT. CLEAN ROOM 
Mac exiting from the maintenance hatch back into the Clean Room. No one sees, no one cares.  Hooking up once again, he ambles toward a door clearly marked EXIT ONLY TO EMPLOYEE LOUNGE - RETURN ONLY THROUGH SECURITY AREA. 
By the door is an employee notice tacked to the wall.  He pretends to scan it.  A stack of flyers.  He takes one.  Exiting into... 
INT. EMPLOYEE LOUNGE 
Past a changing area, vending machines, guys bullshitting.  Mac just strolling along, reading his flyer, as... 
A hand.  Touches his shoulder 
VOICE (subtitled Japanese) Excuse me. 
Mac turns, stares through his opaque VISOR at a well-built SECURITY OFFICER.  Dead straight eyes. 
OFFICER (subtitled Japanese) The company picnic.  Saturday or Sunday? 
His eyes cut to the flyer Mac is 'reading'.  Mac hands it to him, and without a trace of Scottish accent... 
MAC (subtitled Japanese) Better eat first. 
INT. GUEST LOBBY 
Gin is up to her ears in grief.  There are no less than five COPS grilling her, taking notes, while the old couple has their second wind and are SHRIEKING in top form.  The bystander gallery has grown to maybe three dozen, and they're all getting their word in. As Gin struggles to cope... 
...she keeps looking at the clock.  Darting glances toward the corridor.  She is freaking out. 
Finally.  She can't stand it.  Hands Mac's billfold to one of the cops, pushes her way through the mob, and... 
...TAKES OFF down the corridor, a security guard in belated pursuit, we go... 
...WITH her DOWN the hallway, WHEEL around a corner, flat-out SPRINTING, SKIDS to a stop at the right doorway and BURSTS INTO... 
INT. MEN'S ROOM 
An empty washroom.  She listens.  Nothing. 
GIN Mr. MacDougal?  Sir? 
No sound.  Uh-oh. 
GIN Uh.  Mr. Ma... 
MAC (O.S., from the stall) Just 'Mac'.  And whatever became of a gentleman's privacy? 
The security guard BARGES IN. 
MAC (O.S.) My God, more females? 
The guard starts railing at Gin a mile a minute.  She calmly takes a WAD of bills from her purse.  Hands them to the guy... 
GIN (subtitled Japanese) Stand outside.  That door.  Two minutes... 
He does.  Alone again. 
GIN I was worried, it's been twenty... 
MAC (O.S.) Eighteen, actually.  The leg is fine, but I got sort of...woozy. 
GIN Woozy. 
MAC (O.S.) Lost my stomach once or twice. 
CUT INSIDE the stall.  He is just re-taping the folded clean suit and hood to the small of his back. 
MAC I'm an old man.  You probably noticed. 
Awkward silence.  He smiles at that, much amused.  Slips on his jacket. 
MAC You should see me without my teeth. 
UNLOCKS the door.  Remembers... 
MAC Ah.  Mustn't forget to zip up. 
That's not what he forgot.  He pulls OUT the coiled black satin cloth strip, SNAPS it free, microchips snug to the underside.  And fits it neatly... 
...DOWN his trouser leg.  The perfect tuxedo stripe. 
OUT the door.  To meet her gaze. 
MAC Odd place, this. 
He goes to her.  Offers his arm. 
MAC What do you suppose they make here?  Video recorders? 
MAC You mean.  Not as old as I look. 
She traces her finger along his cheek. 
GIN (a whisper) Yeh. 
And kisses him.  It takes awhile.  She seems to enjoy it.  With him, it's harder to tell.  When she pulls back... 
...he picks up a chocolate.  Tears it in half.  Offers her the larger piece. 
GIN Do I deserve a reward? 
No answer.  He puts the chocolate into her mouth.  With great tenderness, he traces the line of her lower lip.  As she swallows. 
GIN It's so hard to find good casual sex, anymore.  I'm probably out of practice. 
But he just looks at her. 
MAC What's hard to find.  Is someone you truly want to be with. 
And leans closer.  Just above a whisper... 
MAC Even for awhile. 
He kisses her.  Beautiful and deep, the way he does it.  And when he pulls back, she is staring at him.  As if at a loss for something to say. 
GIN It's lucky we stopped by my room, for the wine. 
She swallows.  Because his gaze is unrelenting. As if not forgetting that she's changed the subject. 
GIN Otherwise, we'd never have found my bag was stolen.  Until tomorrow. 
MAC Would that make it more stolen? 
She smiles.  His face looks kind now, not formidable at all.  Maybe she's wondering if she actually likes him. 
GIN They even got my prescriptions. 
MAC Something you need? There are all-night chemists... 
He does look concerned.  And therefore sweet.  She kisses his nose. 
GIN I take Prilosec.  For stomach acid.  And an inhaler.  For asthma. 
She gets her old smile.  The soft, wicked tease. 
GIN But since I didn't have to work all that hard tonight... 
He stares at her.  Cocks a finger, like a gun, right between her eyes.  Pantomimes pulling the trigger. 
GIN (softly) Ouch.  I had that coming. 
She pivots, and snuggles her back comfortably into his chest.  He wraps strong arms around her.  Pulling her close. 
GIN Why would someone steal my luggage? Every guest in this place must have more than a wannabe art dealer. 
MAC Ah.  Maybe the thief thought you had something valuable in there. 
Something in the tone. 
GIN Such as... 
MAC Well.  Wannabe dealers make excellent fences. 
A flicker.  In her eyes.  And she cuddles back.  As if enjoying the humor. 
GIN He thought I had a stolen painting.  In my bag. 
MAC I'm joking, of course. 
Kisses the top of her head. 
MAC The Vermeer wouldn't fit. 
Her eyes widen.  Just a little. 
GIN Excuse me? 
MAC Why, did you do something wrong? 
She turns all the way around.  Their faces are inches apart.  Each reading the other's eyes. 
GIN You said.  Vermeer. 
MAC The most famous painting stolen this week. 
His turn.  To kiss her nose. 
MAC If you don't keep up on your craft.  You'll miss all the jokes. 
And lowers her gently onto her back.  Still staring in her eyes, he winds her legs around him.  Her mouth parts, but... 
...he fills it with his own. 
This conversation.  Is over. 
INT. MAC'S SUITE - MORNING 
VIEW of the empty terrace, the rumpled, twisted coverlet.  Maybe they spent all night.  HEAR the shower running full blast in a distant bathroom.  PULL BACK to see... 
Gin, hair wet, wrapped in a plush hotel robe, rapidly and expertly going through dresser, night stand, closet, sofa cushions, every goddam thing in the room.  She comes to... 
She hesitates. 
OKATI Four million, six hundred thirteen thousand, five hundred? 
Wow.  He slaps his hand on the table.  Lay it down, toots. 
GIN You first. 
He shrugs.  Lifts straight up, from beneath the counter... 
...a brown paper-wrapped rectangle.  Not much larger than two feet square.  She can't even believe she's here, doing this.  Gestures to him.  Open it up! 
He obliges, COUGHING grossly all the while.  Unwrapped, the painting does look like a Monet.  From here.  She stares at it. 
GIN Now bring me the real one. 
He doesn't blink. 
OKATI This as real as it gets, lady. 
And from within her pocket.  The cellular RINGS.  She takes it out.  Puts it to her ear. 
MAC (O.S.) You got it? 
GIN (into phone) Is this an audition, a joke, or a rip-off?  I'm staring at an obvious forgery, here. 
MAC (O.S.) Turn it over. 
This gives her pause.  Then, cradling the phone against her shoulder, she does as she's told.  To see... 
MAC (O.S.) Is there an envelope?  Taped to the back?  In a Ziploc bag? 
Sure is. 
GIN (into phone) Uh-huh. 
MAC (O.S.) Detach the bag.  Read what's in it.  Aloud. 
She does.  Carefully unfolding several sheets of paper, maps... 
GIN (reading into phone) Shikoku Naru, a freighter, it says, Yokohama to Jakarta...dates, statistics...specs on some kind of machine, diag... 
MAC (O.S.) Papers back in the envelope, envelope back in the Ziploc, very quickly, without seeming to hurry... 
Her eyes are flickering questions, but she does as she's told, cradling the phone with her shoulder. 
MAC (O.S.) Now take the debit card from your purse, slipping the Ziploc into the purse as you do it, shielding the move from everyone in the room but Okati. 
And she does.  More deftly than we could ever have imagined.  Like a pro. 
MAC (O.S., quietly) Give him the card. 
A beat. 
GIN (into phone) Mac, the painting's a forg... 
MAC (O.S., even quieter) This is a test.  Of whether you'll still be alive four minutes from now.  Do you hear me? 
Her face freezes.  In a pleasant smile. 
GIN (into phone) Yes, Mac, I do. 
MAC (0.5.) Now.  Hand him the card, and tell him in Japanese to pretend he is checking it by phone.  Tell him to take awhile, as if he's on hold. 
She turns the sweet plastic smile to Okati.  Hands him the card... 
GIN (subtitled Japanese) Mac says, pretend you're checking this by phone, and take your ti... 
OKATI (subtitled Japanese) ...like I'm on hold, sure. 
And suddenly, his eyes are keen and quick, and he is no longer some schmuck in baggy pants.  He takes the card, stares at it comically, picks up the phone. 
MAC (O.S.) While he's checking, look around the room casually, as if searching for the cheesy handbags... 
She begins to. 
MAC (O.S.) All the while laughing, as if you are chatting with someone you actually like. 
GIN (into phone) I'm not that good. 
But she is.  And she laughs, as she strolls over to the cheesy handbags. 
MAC (O.S.) As you're looking around, do you notice any m... 
GIN (into phone) Three guys, two together, one alone.  Cheap suits, not looking at me in a cop-casual way. 
MAC (O.S.) Call out cheerily to Okati, in English, 'Where's the toilet?' 
GIN (into phone) Can I say, 'little girl's room'? 
A beat. 
MAC (O.S.) Wing it. 
GIN (calls out, cheerily) WHERE'S THE CRAPPER? 
Okati, absorbed by his make-believe phone call, points around the back. 
MAC (O.S.) Get going.  Now. 
GIN (into phone, as she saunters) Mac, the painting isn't... 
MAC You probably won't be dating any of them, so what the hell. 
Gin looks around as they float through the maze of watercraft.  No one seems to be paying much attention.  What the hell.  She unzips the bag, pulling out... 
GIN (astonished) These...these are mine! 
He never looks around. 
MAC Found 'em in your room.  Perhaps the thief wasn't your size. 
She stares at the back of his head.  wondering.  He is stripping off his slickers.  A neatly-tailored SUIT beneath. 
MAC We have a business appointment. In four minutes. 
Okay.  She pulls her dress off OVER her head. 
GIN Business, huh? 
She ignores some nearby WHISTLES and SHOUTS.  Begins drying herself with a fluffy towel from the bag. 
MAC (never turns) Time has come to tell you.  What business.  I'm actually in. 
Uh-oh.  Paydirt. 
GIN Uh.  Am I gonna like th... 
MAC (quietly) I'm a thief. 
She can scarcely believe he's admitting this. 
MAC And now that I've told you. I'll have to kill you. 
He chuckles a Scottish chuckle.  Cold and warm, at once. 
MAC Or... 
She slips the dry dress OVER her head. 
MAC ...you can spend the most interesting three weeks of your life.  Training. 
GIN Training for wha... 
MAC ...followed by the most exciting night of your life.  After which, you can walk away with 20 million untraceable dollars... 
She blinks.  He means this. 
MAC ...which will come in handy. Things being what they are. 
He shrugs. 
MAC From now on.  You can valet park. 
She begins taking off her wet underwear, underneath the dress.  We suspect unseen hordes crestfallen at her modesty. 
GIN And if I refuse? 
MAC (very quietly) Don't.  Please. 
GIN I mean, you won't really kill me, I'm far too adorable. 
He looks around at her.  As if deciding on that. 
MAC Last night, at Fujitsu, I did some business.  While you thought I was in the toilet. 
Jesus. 
GIN What could you possibly steal in 18 min... 
MAC Thirty-five super-microchips. Each worth one million dollars. And change. 
Staring dead at her eyes. 
GIN You hate round num... 
MAC I stole your suitcase when I left you at the bar.  I have since sent it on to the States, with three chips, well hidden. 
Are you following? 
MAC Since you aren't there to claim it, the bag will sit at Customs. Safe.  Unless... 
No smile.  No smile at all. 
MAC They receive.  An anonymous.  Tip. 
Holy.  Fucking.  Christ. 
GIN That's entrapment. 
MAC No, entrapment is what cops do to robbers. 
We can feel her heart pounding from here. 
MAC Blackmail.  Is what robbers do to schmucks. 
And leans.  To kiss her mouth. 
MAC (softly) Even adorable ones. 
They have glided up beside the gangway of a gigantic FREIGHTER.  It is at water level, the steps they use for their tender.  He points up to the name... 
MAC Pop quiz. 
The man beams.  Gestures to a series of PLATFORMS, each SWAYING at different heights, in different directions. 
CARLSBY Our 'delicate treasure' platforms, suspended on gimbals.  Your cargo remains unruffled by roiling seas. Then, on arrival, is plucked... 
Pointing once more... 
CARLSBY By that forklift, and gently deposited on dock through the cargo hatch... 
...a huge circular hatch cut into the hull.  Mac's eyes stare blankly at it.  A long beat.  He pronounces it all... 
MAC Adequate.  I suppose. 
And then turns once more. 
MAC Did we see...a bathing pool. On deck? 
CARLSBY Oh, yes, sir.  The Shikoku Maru carries sixteen luxury suite pas- senger cabins.  The finest cuisine. For valued clients who prefer to cruise in privacy. 
Mac.  Thinks this over. 
MAC Mildly.  Interesting. 
INT. PASSENGER DECK - DAY 
Carlsby ushering the couple along a plushly-appointed hallway.  A secret oasis of refinement in the heart of the massive freighter. He opens a burnished door, into... 
...an elegant SUITE.  Cherrywood panels, spacious windows with views of the harbor.  The finest furnishings.  It is breathtaking. Even... 
MAC Adequate.  I suppose. 
GIN But dearest, in five months, we'll be in Cape Town. 
Mac pulls from his pocket the folded sheets that had once been taped to the back of Okati's Monet.  Peruses them casually. 
MAC Anything sooner?  That goes perhaps from...say, Sri Lanka? To Jakarta. 
And looks up.  To a man dumbstruck.  By coincidence. 
CARLSBY Why, yes.  In three weeks. 
INT. CESSNA - DAY 
Looking DOWN on California's San Joaquin Valley from 12,000 feet, as air RUSHES past our open door. 
MAC (O.S.) You seem depressed. 
PULL BACK to see them both in jumping suits.  He's checking her gear.  She's eyeing the expansive grid of fields below. 
GIN At your insistence, I'm leaping to my death, and I don't know why! 
He clips a tether from his harness to hers. 
MAC Because.  You're a greedy girl. 
GIN I'm not jumping until you talk about this, it's been two days! 
She folds her arms across her chest.  Rebellious.  He smiles at her tenderly.  Nods, okay. 
GIN Why are we going in three weeks, if the wine is on a different route months lat... 
MAC There is no wine.  That just bought us a look at their security. 
She stares at him. 
GIN I knew that. 
MAC What we want is on the boat in three weeks.  Now can we jump? 
GIN The machine in those diagrams.  on the back of the painting. 
Maybe.  He's still smiling. 
GIN What does it do, make gold? 
MAC We're nearing the targ... 
GIN Why won't you trust me? 
MAC How do I know who you are, hmmn? 
Stares in her eyes. 
MAC For all I know, your name isn't Virginia Romay.  Maybe you're a cop. 
She stares back.  Dead straight. 
GIN Why would a cop do all th... 
MAC (softly) Entrapment, remember? What cops do to robbers. 
GIN (just as softly) Oh.  That. 
His smile is light, affectionate.  Gently, he backs her to the edge of the doorway... 
MAC One...two... 
She THROWS her arms around his neck.  Holds him close. 
GIN Mac, I'm afraid. 
Vulnerable and touchingly real.  His arms slide around her. 
DISAPPEAR in an ocean of STYROFOAM packing bubbles, which EXPLODE in all directions like popcorn in a nuclear accelerator. 
She has totally VANISHED.  Buried alive. 
GIN (O.S.) DID I SAY SHIT? 
Mac is wading into the sea of plastic bits, DIGGING her body out with his bare hands.  Once more, she comes up sputtering. 
GIN This one, I will not get! 
He's holding her in his arms.  Leans close. 
MAC But you will, you'll get it all. You are actually... 
He kisses her. 
MAC Quite remarkable. 
Something in the way he looks at her.  Her return gaze is naked. It looks like love. 
MAC Take the rest of the evening off. 
And kisses her again.  Her eyes close. 
EXT. FRONT PORCH - MORNING 
Mac sits alone at a table, sipping coffee, reading Barron's.   A short-wave radio is playing BBC World Service.  Leaning against an open laptop, is... 
...Mac's stopwatch.  He glances up at it.  What he sees makes him reach into a duffle at his feet, withdraw... 
...a rectangular gun-metal gray DEVICE.  Looks like a cross between a remote control clicker and a large cell phone.  Turns it ON.  The power display GLOWS green. 
EXT. HILLTOP - MORNING 
Gin running alone.  Up the dirt path we've seen before.  Ahead, the crossroads, the sign.  The lonely phone booth. 
EXT. FRONT PORCH 
Mac tuning the device, which is an advance-design SCANNER.  We HEAR overlapping CONVERSATIONS through bursts of STATIC... 
OVERLAPPING VOICES (O.S.) ...told you it's not a good time f...either, personally, I've never liked h...Giants' pitching, once ag...late, you want the Chronicle or don't y... 
INT. PHONE BOOTH 
Gin at the phone.  Inserts her credit card.  Catches her breath. 
EXT. FRONT PORCH 
Mac HEARS a phone RINGING over the scanner.  Punches RECORD, PLUGS the scanner INTO his laptop. 
VOICE (O.S.) Webber Assurance. 
GIN (O.S.) This is oh-four-six-one.  Hector Cruz, please, on a secure line. 
VOICE (O.S.) Please hold. 
Mac's laptop screen in printing.  WEBBER ASSURANCE...HECTOR CRUZ... 
VOICE (O.S.) Go ahead, please. 
GIN (O.S.) Thank y... 
The line goes DEAD. 
So do Mac's eyes.  Click the scanner OFF. 
INT. PHONE BOOTH 
Gin in her throaty, playful voice... 
GIN ...no way I'm telling you shit. 
CRUZ (O.S.) Baker, this is an extremely dangerous g... 
GIN ...right now, you're more dangerous than he is. 
A pause.  Her voice is smiling.  Not her eyes. 
CRUZ (O.S.) You want to explain th... 
GIN If I tell you what this is, and where this is, you'll send back-up, and those morons will blow my cover, and I'll be too dead to accept your apology. 
A longer beat. 
CRUZ (O.S.) You're fucking him, aren't you? 
GIN Right to the wall. 
Her eyes are stone cold.  We've never seen her like this.  She looks like Mac. 
CRUZ (O.S.) You're over your head, Baker. 
GIN Only romantically.  I'll write to him in prison. 
She's pulling out a different piece of plastic.  A drug store phone card. 
CRUZ (O.S.) Okay, it's your funeral.  Next time I see you, I owe you a spanking. 
GIN Ooooo.  Is that a promise? 
Her cold eyes through his chuckle. 
GIN And how does this fit into the game pl... 
MAC Oh, it doesn't.  We came for the view. 
And from his contoured backpack, he pulls a bottle of Cristal. Flutes, wrapped in velvet.  He POPS the cork in one motion, and it SAILS to its watery doom.  She can't help but watch. 
One more motion to pour both glasses.  Hands one to her.  Toasts... 
MAC To Ginger Baker. 
He clicks her glass.  She stares straight in his eye.  Shows no surprise, no fear... 
GIN I'm partial to drummers.  If they played with Clapton and Winwood. 
And takes a sip.  Cool as a goose.  Licks her lips. 
GIN The prescription bottle.  When you stole my suitcase. 
But he's not drinking.  Only staring.  The wind has picked up. 
GIN Armand Baker was my husband, May 13 to October 27, 1982, he played alto sax, I was 17 years old. 
She takes another sip.  Good wine. 
GIN He named me Ginger.  He likes drummers, too. 
MAC And you get sentimental for him. Every time you order drugs. 
GIN I have I.D. in that name.  I use it for various things I don't want traced.  When credit unions turn their computers my way. 
MAC I could listen to you lie all night. 
She toasts him. 
GIN (softly) Same here, fella. 
Slowly, he reaches to an inside pocket, watching to see if she flinches.  Her eyes do flicker.  And follow.  He withdraws not a pistol, but a handful of... 
MAC Do you like diamonds? 
Nine DIAMONDS, so large, so exquisite, she has to keep her eyes from bugging.  Wow. 
MAC You asked.  Does the machine. Make gold. 
Holy.  Christ. 
MAC Gold is shit.  It's six thousand dollars a pound.  Worth your weight in gold...? 
His eyes travel her body... 
MAC That would put you at seven hundred thousand. 
GIN Would you pay it? 
And he leans.  Looks in her eyes. 
MAC When the light hits you just right.  I'd pay more. 
She liked that.  Maybe a lot. 
GIN The machine.  That we are stealing. Makes diamonds? 
No answer. 
GIN Real ones? 
MAC Gem quality.  First ever.  God save Japan. 
He toasts Blessed Japan to the East.  Takes a hit. 
MAC A diamond reactor takes graphite, runs it through a combination of lasers, electron beams, and scanning- tunnel mg microscopes. 
He means this.  She is transfixed. 
MAC This one uses krypton-fluorine laser, with a new isotope of krypton. 
She looks down at the diamonds in his palm.  His fist CLOSES. 
MAC The atoms are rearranged.  And the molecule of graphite becoznes a molecule of... 
He turns his fist UPSIDE-DOWN.  And LETS GO!  She GASPS as the brilliant stones FALL toward the sea.  Watching, watching, long after the moonlit glimmer has evaporated.  A hush. 
GIN I hate it.  When you make a point. 
INT. SHIKOKU MARU - DAY 
CLOSE on two open PASSPORTS.  The names say BANQUO MACDUFF and ISADORA DUNCAN.  The faces are Mac and Gin. 
STEWARD (O.S.) All right, then.  All set. 
PULL BACK to see Mac and Gin dressed as tropical tourists.  She hangs on his arm. 
STEWARD We will keep your passports in our safe until Jakarta. 
MAC Of course. 
STEWARD You are Suite 16... 
GIN ...and never been kissed. 
The steward doesn't get it.  Gin shrugs, sorry. 
GIN Well, it's an eight billion dollar jump.  You miss the train...you've missed the train. 
Flicks ON her remote.  Down the track the engine REVS.  Like crazy. 
GIN We've got five days to grab the Bones, trade them for the Scan, and pull our 8 billion out of Hong Kong. Once midnight passes on July 1st... 
MAC ...we've missed the train, yeh. The Bones?  The Scan? 
GIN Oh.  Have I neglected to fill in the details? 
MAC An oversight. 
GIN Which I learned from the master. Hey.  Wish me luck... 
CLICKS the remote, the train LEAP5 forward, 36 MPH never seemed so fast!  She has a split-second to LEAP down, the train SAILS beneath her, Gin's feet GRAZE the back end of the platform at the rear of the car, she SWIPES DESPERATELY with the magnets, can't connect, and is THROWN into a ROLL along the side of the tracks. 
She's UP on her knees, watching the train SLAM into the massive blue PADS at the end of the track.  She is bruised, shaken, but most of all, really worried and really pissed. 
MAC (quietly) Jump sooner. 
She pulls out the remote... 
GIN Be my fucking guest. 
The train ROCKETS backward, straight PAST where she kneels, to BRAKE at the start of the track once more.  She nods up to Mac, who is strapping on his magnets.  He crouches, nods, ready.  And the train... 
...BLASTS toward him, he counts, JUMPS, and SLAMS ONTO the ROOF of the train, which PLOWS into the heavy padding, FLINGING him twenty feet like a rag doll to land in a HEAP. 
He lies still.  Then blinks, surprised he's alive.  HEARS a rich whiskey LAUGHTER down the track. 
MAC I'm too old for this shit! 
And as he pulls himself up.  She is staring at him, from her knees... 
GIN Know a dude named Wiley Coyote? 
...with what can only be described as love. 
GIN (softly) Forget it. 
EXT. NATIONAL PALACE MUSEUM, TAIPEI - DAY 
AERIAL VIEW down toward the sweeping pagoda roofs of the MUSEUM, the formal gardens, the fountains, the tree-lined driveway.  CLOSE now, as a cab pulls up, a couple emerges... 
She is first.  Chanel suit with an extremely short skirt, revealing endless legs.  She helps him from the taxi, a white-haired geezer who seems well past 90, fumbling with his walking stick, and making quick, erratic, bird-like glances in every direction. 
She takes his arm for support.  Murmurs in his ear... 
GIN Isn't it easier now?  Not pretending? 
Gives him a full-tongue KISS in the ear, which has bystanders noticing.  Starts to help him up the stairs, still whispering close... 
GIN Five years, you won't need make-up. 
In answer he GRABS her ass, and she YELPS with delight, attract- ing attention all around.  His turn to whisper, as he massages her backside... 
MAC We agreed.  No underwear. 
GIN Overkill.  I can do it with legs. 
He stops.  Gives the long legs a dubious twice-over. 
MAC I'd lose the underwear. 
INT. MUSEUM - DAY 
Mac leaning on her arm, as they pass case after case.  Bronzes, jades, lacquer work.  Every object exquisite, priceless. 
GIN The Oracle Bones date back to the Shang Dynasty, 3500 years ago. They are writings...carved into ox bones, tortoise shells... 
She cuddles close to him.  They approach a tour group, the female guide speaking in four European languages.  Really loud. 
GIN The oldest Chinese writing any- where, the first proof of Chinese civilization. 
MAC What makes this one so valuable? 
He stops, drowned out by the tour guide, rhapsodizing over an urn. Butts into her rap... 
MAC (subtitled Italian) Except it's Chien-lung, mimicking Sung Period.  The color is far too delicate. 
The woman gets real insulted.  Apparently, he's right. 
MAC (subtitled German) It's all right, you have a nice body. 
And walks on.  Confides to Gin... 
MAC When you're old, you can do anything 
GRABS her bottom once more, altering her voice slightly on... 
GIN There we are. 
A separate display room.  A single steel pedestal.  Under the smart-glass security case, one single object.  It is a fragile, yellowed fragment of bone.  The shoulder blade of an ox.  Covered with tiny script. 
GIN Last year, ancient artifacts were discovered in the Gulf of Mexico. An Olmec civilization, 3200 years old. 
No tourists in the display room.  A velvet rope is up.  Three GUARDS mill at the entrance.  This exhibit is off-limits. 
GIN Amazingly, markings on these Olmec figures were identified as Shang Dynasty writing... 
A sign explains, SORROWFUL TO INFORM ORACAL BONE CLOSE FOR TRAVEL EXIBITION UNTIL IS NOVEMBER. 
MAC Try to adjust to that for three more days.  After July 1... 
Stares in her eyes. 
MAC ...you'll never have to trust again. 
And smiles.  One more whisper... 
MAC Something.  To look forward to. 
INT. TUNNEL LOADING DOCK 
The museum guards are back on the landing with the official.  Our two soldiers stand facing them from the rear platform of the train car, as... 
The train RUMBLES to life.  Ready to go. 
INT. MUSEUM 
Two guards arrive with a hand truck to carry off the empty pedestal, which once supported the Bone's case.  One tilts the top of the pedestal back, supporting its weight, as the other stoops to lift the base, and... 
...stops.  He sees the coin.  Oddly flat against the pedestal's shaft.  He kneels, tries to lift the coin, but the magnet HOLDS it fast.  He looks up to his companion.  Then... 
...PEELS the coin free, the other guard reaches for it, the first guard YANKS it away, and it FLIES from his hand, INTO the wall, and drops.  As the guards go to look, the coin's back has come away. Revealing... 
...electronics. 
INT. TUNNEL LOADING DOCK 
An ALARM SHRIEKS at a deafening level.  Five museum GUARDS BURST through the doorway, LEAP from the landing, pile into the Jeep, and BLAST OFF down the gravel roadway after the departed train. 
INT. BARRACKS ENTRANCE 
A much larger landing at the other end of the tunnel, facing back the opposite way.  The ALARM SCREAMS here, too, and massive steel doors CLANG open, as 25 SOLDIERS with assault rifles SWARM out onto the landing, taking up sharpshooter positions, weapons pointing back up the track. 
INT. AIR VENT #1 
Mac and Gin crouched in the vent, high above the track, gas masks dangle around their necks, magnet paddles from their wrists, various objects from their belt loops.  The alarm ECHOES, absolutely EAR-SPLITTING.  She leans to shout in his ear... 
GIN WE HAVE TO ABORT! 
Above the siren, we can now hear the TRAIN coming... 
MAC HOW DO YOU EXPECT TO MAKE A CAREER OF THIS, IF YOU CAN'T TAKE A LITTLE INCONVENIENCE? 
The train LOUDER, closer, the alarm BLARING... 
GIN THEY'VE GOT AN ARMY DOWN TH... 
MAC I can do this. 
Quietly.  Straight in her eyes.  The train ROARS into view, FLASHES beneath them, as he GRABS her wrist and... 
...JUMPS, HURTLING DOWN, both STRIKING the empty rear platform, Gin slipping off, but he HOLDS her fast, SWIPING with his magnet which... 
...CLANKS hard, LOCKS solid.  He PULLS her onto the platform, she looks dazed, clinging to him, he tugs her gas mask into place, slips on his own, and... 
...FITS a magnetic DEVICE from his belt loop ONTO the door lock, SPINS a dial on the device, which POPS the lack OPEN, Mac BURSTING... 
...THROUGH the door, lobbing a GAS GRENADE at the startled guards, who try to whirl and FIRE through the fog of red smoke, two wild SHOTS above the rolling Mac, and they are felled by the gas where they stand.  Gin races in, falling on her butt, as the car ROCKS along the track.  Points OUT the window... 
GIN (through mask) THERE'S THE NUMBER TWO VENT, ONLY 45 SECONDS TO THE THIRD! 
Scrambling to her feet, Mac wheeling toward the Bone. 
GIN (through mask) TEST THE CASE! 
He THROWS a handful of coins at the glass case, and purple UV BEAMS ARC from the glass to FRY the coins in midair.  Mac pulls a dull rectangle the size of a cigar box from Gin's backpack, as we SMASH CUT to... 
INT. TUNNEL 
The Jeep BLASTING after the train at crazy speed, the four non- drivers with weapons at the ready... 
INT. BARRACKS LANDING 
TROOPS FILL the platform, and have spilled onto the tracks, enough weapons to dust Butch and Sundance. 
INT. TRAIN 
Mac operating the cigar box which is actually a customized OSCILLOSCOPE, with countless KNOBS and a SCREEN which displays WAVE PATTERNS.  The machine is emitting SHRILL whistling TONES that cut through even the siren. 
GIN (through mask) TAKE IT TO 30 AND CLIMB! 
Mac SPINS the dials and two overhead light bulbs BLOW.  The glass case housing a fire ax SHATTERS.  The Bone's case is untouched. 
SMASH CUT to... 
INT. TUNNEL 
WITH the Jeep, BOMBING around a curve to SEE the train at last.  WE OPEN FIRE, accelerating after the train with everything we've got, gravel FLYING like shrapnel, and up ahead... 
...the train's windows BLOW OUT, the tunnel SHOWERED with glass fragments.  SMASH CUT... 
INT. TRAIN 
Mac JUICING the box, the deafening TONE competing with the sirens, the gunshots, Gin SHRIEKING as she points through a blasted-out window... 
GIN (through mask) THIRD VENT GONE! 
And the Bone's case EXPLODES, Gin WHIRLING away to protect her face, as we SMASH CUT to... 
INT. TUNNEL 
INT. VENT - DAY 
Mac, very much alive, somewhat the worse for wear, crawling through a darkened pipe on his belly, toward... 
...a grating.  Light filters through.  Reaching the screen, he squints through it.  Can't see shit.  Listens.  Nothing that rises above an ambient wooshing of air in the duct.  He grasps the wires, pushes, and... 
...FALLS straight THROUGH, tumbling ten feet to CRASH LAND in a heap.  HEAR feminine SCREAMS before we look up to... 
...three young WOMEN trying on lingerie, being attended by an older SALESWOMAN.  The girls are half-naked and as Mac rises, one THROWS a red lace TEDDY in his face.  He peels it off, and still holding the garment, calmly tells the saleswoman... 
MAC (subtitled Mandarin) It's all right, the security cameras behind the mirrors are working again. 
At which the customers SHRIEK, cover themselves all the more, and begin screaming at the poor saleswoman.  During which... 
MAC (subtitled Mandarin) Well.  If everything is in order... 
All four women.  Look at him. 
EXT. LINGERIE SHOP, SHIN KONG MALL - SUNSET 
CLOSE on an entrance, just as Mac comes... 
...FLYING THROUGH, propelled by two sizeable SECURITY GUARDS, once again landing in pieces.  It's a long day.  As Mac clears his head, they stand at the doorway with folded arms.  Hoping he wants some more. 
MAC WHAT KIND OF A COUNTRY IS THIS?  IN BRITAIN, A MAN CAN TRY ON LINGERIE WITHOUT COMPROMISING HIS DIGNITY! 
The bruisers look at each other.  No habla Espanol. 
EXT. KAOHSHING HARBOR, TAIWAN - DUSK 
A super TUGBOAT, engines RUMBLING, ready to pull out.  A woman paces the deck.  Every time we see her, she seems more tightly wrapped.  At last... 
...here he comes, stepping briskly from the taxi, striding up the gangway, pulling from inside his coat... 
...the red lace teddy.  He drapes it over her face, and she pulls it away, steps into his arms... 
...her kiss is urgent.  Real.  HOLD on the look in her eyes.  What is she thinking? 
He strokes her hair, gently.  Then, goes to look into the Halliburton case, which stands by the rail.  As he crouches.  As he looks at the Bone... 
She is watching him.  An intensity to her gaze.  More feeling than she is comfortable with, which... 
...disappears completely, as he turns to her.  And when he mimes FLINGING the case into the sea... 
She laughs. 
EXT. STATUE SQUARE, HONG KONG - DAY 
CLOSE on a British Petroleum BILLBOARD with a huge DIGITAL CLOCK, counting down by seconds...JUNE 29, 1997, 11:32 A.M. - 1 DAY, 12 HOURS, 27 MINUTES, 48 SECONDS TO:  REUNION WITH CHINA! 
PAN to an AERIAL VIEW of... 
Hong Kong's bustling STATUE SQUARE, the hub of countless feeder streets and alleyways, as we ROAM to a SERIES OF SHOTS... 
...billboards everywhere.  Western businesses that announce WE'LL STILL BE HERE FOR YOU.  Others, primarily British, sending farewells, gratitude for past patronage.  China-sponsored depictions of happy Hong Kong and Chinese citizens, proclaim ONE COUNTRY, TWO SYSTEMS. 
...moving vans, people pushing carts of belongings, shop signs advertising blowout inventory clearance sales.  Traffic beyond gridlock.  The human ant colony. 
...incredibly long queues in front of post offices, American Express, the imposing glass and steel skyscraper called the HONG KONG AND SHANGHAI BANK BUILDING. 
...large groups of uniformed CHINESE SOLDIERS in the streets.  More orderly DEMONSTRATION by anti-China PROTESTERS, their signs say MORE DEMOCRACY and FREE HONG KONG, their numbers watched by Chinese soldiers, who in turn are watched by British soldiers. 
CLOSE on the square now.  A couple at a sidewalk vendor.  Mac is purchasing a t-shirt.  Gin dutifully lifts her arms, and Mac slips the garment over her head.  It says CHINA GOT HONG KONG, AND ALL I GOT WAS THIS LOUSY T-SHIRT. 
He regards her thoughtfully, and she turns, modeling for him as if wearing a Givenchy original.  He approves, lifts the Halliburton case, and they move on, strolling, chatting until Mac... 
...bumps HARD into a Chinese SOLDIER, both men REELING with the impact.  The soldier carries an identical HALLIBURTON CASE, and the two men set their cases down side by side, as Mac steps forward... 
MAC (subtitled Mandarin) FUCKING HELL!  WATCH WHERE YOU'RE GOING, MAN! 
No one notices, no one cares.  Gin tugs on Mac's arm, don't get involved, dear.  Mac reluctantly steps back.  The soldier glares at him.  Then, bends and picks up... 
...Mac's case.  A parting epithet in Mandarin, and the soldier starts off.  Watching him, Mac unobtrusively fingers a concealed... 
...PISTOL, ready for action.  But keeps watching, as within a few yards, the soldier... 
...stops.  Opens the case.  Checks out the Oracle Bone, right there in the middle of the square.  Mac and Gin watching across the distance, with hair-trigger keenness.  At last the soldier CLOSES the case... 
...walks back to us. 
SOLDIER (subtitled Mandarin) I believe I took your case. 
Handing it to Mac, he leans forward, and in low, aecented English... 
SOLDIER 21 Old Peak Road.  In 45 minutes. 
Picks up his own case.  And is gone. 
EXT. MANSION, VICTORIA PEAK - DAY 
A vintage Aston Martin pulls up to a spectacular gated MANSION. Sparkling white, it is a blend of Edwardian and Regency.  Gin is driving, speaks into the voice box, and the gate swings open.  As they pull up the crushed rock driveway... 
...a BUTLER appears, as British as the architecture.  Climbing from the car, Mac has the Halliburton case. 
BUTLER Will you please come this way? 
And leads them around the side of the house.  They walk slowly, a distance behind the butler, taking everything in. 
MAC I like this. 
His voice is strong, calm.  No hint of a smile. 
...goggles.  Like one would wear in a tanning salon.  Only these are flesh-colored with one small hole in the center of each lens. Slightly larger than the size of a pupil. 
She slips them on.  A bright smile. 
GIN How do I look, honey? 
And Mac smiles.  In return. 
MAC Like a woman.  Of mystery. 
INT. SUITE, PENINSULA HOTEL - LATE NIGHT 
Glass doors open WIDE to a terrace which overlooks Kowloon, the harbor, Hong Kong Island beyond.  More lights than stars in heaven. And speaking of heaven... 
...the SOUNDS of lovemaking are fierce, feral, an urgent rhythm, part comic, part wondrous, and mostly, arousing enough to make us PAN TO... 
...lovemaking in silhouette.  This is the lovemaking of tigers, mesmerizing to watch, ferocious enough to inspire envy, and somehow... 
...tender enough.  To suggest real love. 
LATER...Mac and Gin sit before the open terrace.  There is wine and food and abandoned clothing all around them.  She has her pack drawn near.  And Qiu's leather pouch.  She removes the goggles... 
This is the moment. 
GIN In the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank Building.  Is a room with two computers.  One for you. And one for me. 
MAC Glad I have a function, here. 
GIN The room is a vault on the 14th floor.  Access codes to that room are changed daily, computer pass- words on the hour, but... 
But.  She is electric, more alive than he's ever seen her. 
GIN Four men in the world.  Don't need codes.  Their retinas will scan to unlock everything.  One of these is China's Minister of Finance. 
She lifts the goggles... 
MAC And his retinal plate is in there. 
Yep. 
MAC Our trade for the great train robbery.  All right, let's say we're in the door.  Now what? 
From her pack, she pulls a slender black rectangle.  Opens it to reveal a shiny metallic DISC. 
GIN Hong Kong has a huge portion of its holdings invested in foreign banks. In hundreds of separate accounts... 
Holds up the metallic disc. 
GIN This CD ROM is programmed to send, instantaneously, thousands of instruc- tions, with all necessary confirmation codes, to transfer reasonably modest sums out of those accounts.... 
MAC Modest. 
GIN Two or three million at a crack, in odd numbers.  Total, eight billion.  And change. 
MAC And you've set up a laundry. 
GIN Every wire transfer gets rocketed through a series of multiple switches, Austria, Uruguay, Antigua, The Channel Islands, the Caymans... 
MAC (quietly) Seychelles? 
GIN (beat) I left that out. 
MAC You're forgiven. 
GIN Thank you.  As soon as each deposit lands somewhere, it's shot somewhere else, til the Mafia couldn't find it. 
MAC But those first instructions, transferring the 8 billion dollars. They're recorded in the main computer. 
She waggles the disc. 
GIN Nope.  The CD instructs the computer to erase the real transactions. And replace them in its memory with an innocuous loan coded XJ6. Little homage to Limeyland, there. 
MAC Dearest.  The accounts won't reconcile. 
She waggles the disc.  Again. 
GIN Wrong.  The CD instructs the computer to over-report all account totals forever, in the exact amounts we've lifted.  So the Chinese think the money's still there. 
On this one.  He has to smile. 
MAC The money.  Is still.  Missing. 
GIN Sure, the foreign banks know they sent out some money.  But they think Hong Kong knows it, too.  And since we're leaving plenty in every account... 
MAC The shit doesn't splatter.  Until the first account runs dry. 
Exactly. 
GIN And then.  Comes the really brilliant part of the whole thing! 
MAC I was hoping there'd be one. 
He settles back.  Looks at her. 
GIN Admit it, so far you're blown away. 
Well... 
MAC It does sound like the beginning of a beautiful friendship. 
And his fingers reach out... 
She looks in his eyes.  Her body seems to relax, just a little. She takes his arm. 
INT. 14TH FLOOR 
CLOSE on a KEYPAD.  Next to it, a mirrored PLATE with two APERTURES, set apart the distance of human eyes.  Gin's goggled face DROPS into frame, reflected in the mirrored surface.  She fits her eyes to the apertures... 
GIN (whispers) Open.  Sesame. 
A red scanning light APPEARS.  Tracks vertically.  BEEPS.  Tracks horizontally.  And from somewhere... 
...a soft CLICK.  PULL BACK now, to see... 
They stand at what seems the door to a BANK VAULT.  Round, gigantic, heavy steel.  Bolts eyerywhere.  Mac reaches to GRASP the handle, and... 
CLANG.  The door swings OPEN.  They stare at the inner sanctum... 
...a windowless ROOM.  Dim, eerie fluorescence.  A blast of white noise from the elaborate air-cooling system.  Two large MAINFRAME COMPUTERS face each other from opposite walls, desks and work stations with PC monitors filling the space between.  As Mac closes the vault door behind them... 
...Gin goes quickly to the smaller mainframe.  Pulls the high- resolution monitor around on its adjustable arm.  The screensaver displays Guernsey cows swimming among tropical fish.  She hits a key.  The screen saver replaced by, WELCOME.  AUTHORIZATION MODE PLEASE.  Two boxes for PASSWORD and SCAN.  She hits SCAN.  A plastic shield RISES, revealing... 
...the mirrored PLATE, the tiny APERTURES.  Gin leans to fit her goggled eyes in place.  The red scanning light.  Vertical track. BEEP.  Horizontal track.  And the monitor announces...WELCOME MINISTER FEIHONG.  Gin takes off the goggles, and... 
...THROWS them across the room to Mac at the larger mainframe.  As he repeats the scanning process, Gin is loading the precious CD-ROM into her mainframe's driver.  Watches the screen... 
GIN Uploading.  And you've got... two minutes, fifty seconds. 
WITH Mac now.  Typing the words CONTROL PANEL.  The screen now shows icons for time setting, and he clicks his mouse to create a CLOCK in the center of the screen, labeled LOCAL TIME, and reading 11:57:19, changing with each second that passes... 
MAC So let's see.  Across town at the British Consulate... 
INTERCUT...frenzied activity in a large war room filled with computers, wall screens, every worker functioning at top speed... CONTINUE to hear Mac over this... 
MAC (V.O.) ...everyone is working frantically to complete transactions before they go off-line at midnight. 
CUT BACK to Mac in the vault.  He clicks his mouse to create a clock at the LEFT of the screen, labeled BRITISH TERMINAL TIME. It is, of course, showing the same time as the local clock. 
MAC ...then, deep in the high-tech bowels of the Bank of China Building, just across the square... 
INTERCUT...an even larger war room, even better staffed and equipped.  Everyone...doing...nothing.  Staring at blank monitors and wall screens. 
MAC (V.O.) ...the Chinese are sitting on their thumbs, waiting to come on-line at midnight. 
CUT BACK to Mac in the vault.  He clicks his mouse to create another clock at the RIGHT of the screen, labeled CHINA TERMINAL TIME.  Shows the same time as the other clocks.  11:58:22. 
MAC I feel for these boys.  Let's give them a breather, hmmn? 
CLICKS the mouse, and the BRITISH TERMINAL TIME begins FLASHING. 
MAC We'll let the Brits go off-line 4 seconds early. 
As the flashing clock reaches 11:58:30, and Mac HITS the key four times, advancing the British clock to 34 seconds, four seconds later than the others. 
MAC And we'll give our new Chinese overlords 4 extra seconds of rest before they have to go on-line. 
As the local and Chinese clocks reach 40 seconds, Mac HITS the key four times, regressing the Chinese clock back to 36 seconds. 
We watch all three clocks, clicking down the last moments of British rule.  The British clock is 4 seconds FAST, the Chinese clock 4 seconds SLOW. 
MAC Playing God here, Ginger.  We've created 8 seconds that do not exist, anywhere but in this room. 
LOCAL TIME...11:59:00.  One minute to midnight. 
MAC 8 seconds, where no one is on-line but your little CD-Rom. 
He turns around.  Her eyes are waiting.  Across the room. 
MAC And when, eventually, everyone discovers what transaction XJ6 was really about... 
GIN China will think it happened before midnight.  Britain will swear it happened after midnight... 
MAC They'll each be positive.  The other guy.  Did it. 
Mac sighs.  This is a sad thing. 
MAC Liable to be an ugly international incident. 
She squints across at his clock. 
GIN Britain off-line in 18 seconds. We're bulletproof. 
His smile returns.  Bittersweet and real... 
MAC Baby girl.  Nothing.  Is bulletproof.  Ever. 
The look holds.  He turns back to his screen.  She lingers on him for an instant.  Then, back to the mainframe, finger poised above her ENTER key... 
MAC Britain goes bye-bye in 6... 
INTERCUT...The British Consulate.  All screens go DARK.  A logo APPEARS of a POPPING Champagne BOTTLE, whose spray forms a Union Jack twined with a PRC flag, everyone SHOUTS, cheers or curses, and we SMASH CUT... 
BACK to Gin...striking ENTER, the screen flashing TRANSACTIONS XJ6 PROCESSING. 
GIN (softly) Jesus God, it's going through. 
MAC (watching his clocks) Hong Kong midnight, happy new year. Except at China Bank. 
GIN (to her screen) C'mon, c'mon... 
Her screen flashes TRANSACTIONS XJ6 COMPLETED, hear her SHRIEK of ecstasy, as we... 
INTERCUT...Bank of China where dark screens suddenly LIGHT with the same stupid PARTY LOGO.  Only nobody cheers.  They just get to work. 
Gin is hanging onto the cable, petrified.  Mac is looking up toward the roof. 
GIN Okay, now what? 
MAC (absently) Shut up.  You're on a 'need-to- know' basis. 
GIN Mac, I'm sorry. 
He looks at her.  Just now, she seems more miserable than afraid. 
GIN Turns out, I'm a screw-up. 
He doesn't smile.  Passing the third canopy. 
MAC Well.  Something to be said for being self-aware. 
Looks back up.  Forty-first floor.  Six to go. 
MAC May I have the last grenade, dear. It's about to rain. 
She blinks.  Huh?  So he reaches into her bag, pulls out the grenade, and THROWS it... 
...STRAIGHT up.  The roof above them EXPLODES in a FIREBALL, and SHIELDS her body against the wall of their shaft, as a huge SECTION of roof comes RAINING down.  We watch as it... 
...CRASHES through the upper canopy, TONS of roof and glass PLUNGING to... 
...BLAST through the middle canopy, everyone below SCRAMBLING for shelter, as the whole shebang... 
...EXPLODES through the lowest canopy.  Gin can only GAPE at the incredible display.  Mouthing a silent WOW. 
They've passed the second canopy, thirty-sixth floor.  Still climbing.  The other two elevators maybe five floors below us. 
MAC You see, banking will be more democratic under China. 
She looks to him. 
MAC Well.  No more glass ceiling. 
The elevator car has STOPPED.  We are at the roof.  The soldiers are in the car beneath our feet, nowhere to get out.  Above our heads. 
...the last few feet of elevator cable.  And starry sky, where our patch of roof used to be. 
MAC How refreshing.  The night air. 
He begins to shimmy up the few feet of cable.  At the top, he reaches out with one hand toward the lip of the remaining roof, GRABS it, LUNGES with his free hand, and... 
...DANGLING 47 floors, he pulls himself UP, swings ONTO the roof. Reaches back down.  She is only twelve feet below him.  Frozen with fear. 
GIN I can't do this. 
MAC You can.  If I say so. 
She stares up at his eyes.  He smiles. 
MAC If you stay.  You'll have to pay for the damage... 
She looks down at the mess below. 
And starts to climb the cable.  Not so easy in a ball gown, but the adrenaline is pumping.  Gets to the top.  Here's the hard part. One hand reaches out... 
...GRABS his.  She lets GO.  And she is DANGLING in space. 
MAC Now that split.  Did we say 
And with all his strength, hauls her up onto... 
...the roof.  Two-thirds of it remain.  At the far edge, a gigantic MAINTENANCE CRANE, itself two stories high.  But between here and the crane... 
...a HELICOPTER.  Big and beautifUl and empty.  She looks like she's seen God.  Mac starts to jog toward it, she runs to follow but sees him go... 
...straight PAST the chopper. 
GIN HEY! 
He turns back. 
She points to the copter.  It's over here. 
MAC Got the keys? 
Oh. 
GIN I thought you could...hot-wire stuff? 
Guess not. 
MAC They fix those things so you can't steal them... 
And keeps walking.  Toward the monster CRANE. 
MAC These, they're not so worried. 
Moving fast, he points off to his right.  Her eyes follow a long CABLE, leading from the arm of the crane, across the roof, attaching by a huge HOOK to a massive WRECKING BALL. 
MAC Go grab that hook. 
He reaches the crane's cab.  Turns back to see she hasn't moved. 
MAC Let me rephrase that.  Run and grab that hook.  Or die... 
Got it?  She takes off running.  He hops IN the cab.  PUSHES the start button.  It rumbles to life.  Tests some levers... 
GIN Not the most flattering way to put it. 
He takes his big tourist shopping bag.  Puts it in her hand. 
MAC I've changed your travel plans. 
They are descending now.  Into the vast underground train station. 
GIN Mine. 
MAC Instead of taking the subway to the airport, you change at Jordan Station for Kowloon Tong.  Got that? 
Got that? 
MAC Jordan is only 90 seconds up the line.  Like a wire transfer, you're gone.  Vanished. 
He holds up a silencing finger.  Listen to me. 
MAC In this bag are passports, tickets, papers.  An amber wig, a good one.  A dress you can slip on in five seconds. 
Her eyes moving over his face.  What is this? 
MAC You're on a tight connection to the Trans-Siberian Express, be in Europe in a week. 
GIN Mac, wh... 
MAC Shhh.  You always talk too much. 
They're at the booth.  He pays their fare.  Through the turnstiles, now. 
MAC Time has come to return the favor. One last time. 
Smiles at her.  As they enter a tunnel. 
MAC Tell you.  What business.  I'm actually in. 
And in an instant of blind panicked clarity.  She gets the whole thing. 
GIN (hushed) My God.  You're a cop. 
MAC (very softly) That's my girl. 
Keep walking.  People are everywhere.  But they are alone in the world. 
MAC See, my profession was cover, too.  A notorious thief has access to colleagues, their plans... 
He sighs. 
MAC I've turned in...well, couple hundred.  over forty years. Scotland Yard, Interpol, FBI... 
Looking around the tunnel. 
MAC Thought I might retire.  After you. 
GIN And all the...microchips, the diamond machine... 
MAC Well, the chips were returned. The machine was just a box, did you actually think it was real? 
Glances at her. 
GIN I thought...everything was real. Stupid girl. 
End of the tunnel in sight now.  It leads to a massive, endless quai.  Trains in transit. 
GIN Those were your jobs, so I could have claimed entrapment.  You had to wait.  For mine. 
Nearly there.  He says nothing.  Looks pretty grim. 
GIN The Oracle Bone... 
MAC Well, the State Department liked that one.  They have more fish to fry with Beijing than Taiwan. 
He sighs. 
MAC So they're taking credit for letting it go through.  Tho I'm afraid your Colonel may be in for a career disappointment. 
She stops walking.  She has to know... 
GIN And the 5 billion. 
Ah.  That. 
MAC I haven't told them. 
Gently, takes her arm.  Leads her onto the endless train platform. Walking slower now. 
MAC I said you hadn't revealed the job.  That it wouldn't take place until after the changeover. 
Down the platform they stroll.  As her eyes wander... 
MAC Don't look, they're there. 
Her breath catches.  Her eyes go down. 
GIN And my tickets.  In the shopping bag? 
MAC Well.  Kept my options open.  If I give you up, they don't matter, do they? 
Her heart pounding through her chest. 
GIN If.

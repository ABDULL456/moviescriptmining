slide past in a 400mm lens. Then, entering a plane of focus is VINCENT. He walks towards us...an arriving passenger. Suit. Shirt. No tie. Sunglasses and expensive briefcase say "confident executive traveler." The suit's custom-made but not domestic. His hair and shades are current, but it would be difficult to describe his identifying specifics...grey suit,        * white shirt, medium height. And that's the idea...                  * 
CLOSE BEHIND VINCENT 
OVER his left shoulder, walking through milling travelers           * towards the distant wall of metal and glass, sunlight streaming at him... 
ANOTHER BUSINESSMAN 
- suit, blonde crew cut - walks to camera. Same sunlight, but it hits him from the side. His trajectory is from the left. His eyeline is slightly right. Just now, he looks down at a ticket in his hand... 
OVER VINCENT'S LEFT SHOULDER... 
right now something catches Vincent's eye.   And the two men bump into each other... 
TWO-SHOT... 
VINCENT You okay?    Sorry... 
Vincent puts down his briefcase.   The man has a similar briefcase. 
MAN (North London working- class accent) Yeah, yeah, I'm fine, mate.   Enjoy                      * LA... 
VINCENT GRABS THE BRIEFCASE OF THE MAN 
with the North London working-class accent. And continues towards the exit. Was it an accident? Was it a brush pass? The Man's accent signified nothing to us except one thing: foreign origin. 
VINCENT 
approaches until he's in ECU...

Images wipe across the screen, kinetic and abstract, floating and dreamlike in SLO-MO: 
Shades of yellow.   Ribbons of silver.    Shimmers of chrome. 
Headlights sweeping past, flaring to white. Brake lights flashing, halating red. Reflections of overhead fluorescence flowing like liquid along windshield glass... 
SOUNDS are dreamlike and abstract, reverberated and discordant, bouncing off concrete walls: car doors OPENING and CLOSING. Brakes. A BABBLE of multi-lingual crosstalk. 
Racing Forms. A Farsi newspaper. African hands on a                  * Blackberry. Max's hands do The New York Times crossword. A           * West African speaks French into a cell phone. Metallica in a         * headset. Hip-hop, Norteno...                                         *

Lights being checked. Indicators. Hazards. Switches. Similar to a pilot doing an aircraft check list. Fast. All fine.

He opens it, preparing for his workday. CD caddy of personal         * mixes goes on a visor. Spreadsheet peaks out a worn Mercedes         * S500 brochure, clipped open. A submarine sandwich from Subway.       *

He starts the engine.   RAP MUSIC BLARES from the radio.      Max turns it off. 
He dumps a CD into the changer. MOZART SONATA fills the cab. From the open briefcase, Max also pulls out one last thing...

The woman, ANNIE FARRELL, enters the cab. Everything about her says "serious professional" from her suit to her briefcase and purse. Still on her cell, her attention is focused on the call. 
ANNIE ...no, the transcriptions need to be                    * done by seven a.m.. Period. Okay?                       * 
MAX How ya' doin'?   Where to? 
ANNIE Downtown. 312 North Spring Street. Take Sepulveda to Slauson to La Brea. La Brea north to 6th into downtown. 
Max pulls away from the curb, starts the meter and turns left. 
ANNIE (CONT'D) (into cell phone) So you'll be up late. I'm pulling an                    * all-nighter, too. Save the tears. 
She ends the call, starts to check her voicemail on her phone. Max's eyes in the rearview mirror...

MAX I'll take 105 east and up the 110. It's faster. 
ANNIE (doesn't look at him) What? 
MAX (louder) 105 to the 110 is faster. 
ANNIE 110 turns into a parking lot around USC. 
MAX This late, the 110 is moving, but La                      * Brea north of the Santa Monica is                         * jammed.                                                   * 
ANNIE 110 north of the 10 you get people                        * going to Pasadena and they drive slow.                    * 
MAX That's why I jump off at Grand.                           * (looks at her) But, hey, surface streets is cool. That's what you want, that's what we do...                                                     * 
Annie looks up for the first time.    Skeptically... 
ANNIE Are we taking bets?   What if you're wrong? 
MAX Your ride is free. 
ANNIE You got yourself a deal. 
12    EXT. OLYMPIC BLVD. - DUSK TO NIGHT                             12 
Max's cab maneuvers easily through light traffic past golf driving ranges.

ANNIE Go ahead, say it.    Go ahead. 
MAX ...lucky with the lights. 
ANNIE You weren't "lucky with the lights." What you were was right. I was                           * wrong... (glances at his license) ...Max. 
She sets the brief aside, eyes tired anyway. She notices the MUSIC playing faintly up front. Bach's "Air on a G String." 
ANNIE (CONT'D) You mind turning this up? 
Max doesn't mind at all. He tweaks the volume up.       Annie leans her head back to listen, closes her eyes. 
MAX You like Bach? 
ANNIE (nods) I used to play this piece in high school. 
MAX Let me guess.    Woodwinds? 
ANNIE (smiles) Viola. I never had the lungs for wind instruments. 
MAX Could'a fooled me, the way you were unloading into that cell phone. 
ANNIE (laughs) Different instrument... (beat) You know, if you'd only listened to me, we'd be all bogged down in traffic right now, and you would have made an extra five bucks. 
MAX Yeah? Keep it. Buy yourself something. Go wild.

ANNIE (off his silence) A gentleman. I thought chivalry was a necessary casualty of gender politics... 
MAX Not a big thing, you know...? 
ANNIE How many cabbies get you into an argument to save you money? 
MAX There were two of us. I killed the other guy. I don't like competition... 
She's charmed by his deadpan. 
She gets out of the cab, starts to walk away... 
...but turns back, ducking into the cab's window. Looking a bit flustered, she pulls a business card and offers it to him. 
ANNIE In case you ever...I don't know...wanna start an investigation of a Fortune 500 company or argue cab routes or something... 
And with that, she goes towards the three assistants waiting for her outside the revolving door. Max is left somewhat stunned, holding her card. He glances down at it: 
ANNIE FARRELL ASSISTANT UNITED STATES ATTORNEY CRIMINAL DIVISION CENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA 
Meanwhile... 
15A   INT. FEDERAL BUILDING, GARAGE - DOOR                         15A    * 
A hand punches a sequence of numbers into a keypad. The garage is visible beyond. The lock unlocks. We see it is Vincent who walks into the steel interior staircase from the garage. 
16    INT. FEDERAL BUILDING - VINCENT - DUSK                         16   * 
emerges from the interior staircase into the lobby in his good      * suit with the expensive briefcase. Casually, he glances to his      * right. We don't know why...

OVER VINCENT 
in front of him is a guard station and a row of tumbrils that require an identity card to not trigger and alarm. Vincent produces his card, scans it across the top.                        *

The indicator goes GREEN. Vincent slips the card into his             * briefcase and walks through, towards the bank of elevators.           * However, he doesn't take an elevator. He walks past them              * towards an escalator down to the street. Why did he walk into,        * through and out of the lobby of the building?                         *

Max still holds Annie's business card, marveling at it and her. From the FRONT... 
VINCENT Hello? 
MAX (glances back) Uh, yeah... 
And Max can't hide his eyeline and interest...

VINCENT (checks his watch) How long you think this'll take? 
MAX Fourteen minutes. 
VINCENT Fourteen?    Not fifteen?   Not thirteen? 
MAX Two minutes to get onto the 101. Transition to the 110 to the 10 and exit on Normandie is four minutes. North on Normandie is five minutes. Two minutes to South Union 'cause there's roadwork. Thirteen plus one for "shit happens." 
Vincent checks his watch. 
VINCENT Mind if I time you? (Max shrugs) What do I get if you're wrong?     A free ride? 
MAX An apology. 
Max heads for the 100 on-ramp. 
MAX (CONT'D) ...I already offered up the free ride                     * today.                                                    *

VINCENT Did you ask her out? 
Vincent's read Max's mind. Max hadn't thought it through that far. Now that he does, reality sinks in. Annie's out of his league and he knows it. 
Gone forever, Max jams her card under the rubber bands on the visor.

MAX Definitely not from around here. 
He kills the engine.    Silence. 
There's a noticeable lack of city noise. DISTANT talk radio. Spanish gospel from a Baptist church. An occasional car passes the mouth of the alley. 
Max trades Mozart for Beethoven. 
Max checks his watch. Dinnertime.     He turns to his battered briefcase on the passenger seat. 
It's filled with carefully arranged items. NAPKINS in the pockets. UTENSILS in the pen holders. FOIL PACKS of mayo and mustard and Thousand Island Dressing. 1.5 liter PLASTIC BOTTLE of vitamin mineral water. The well-worn Mercedes brochure for       * the S500. A spreadsheet, like a handwritten business plan. A        * large submarine sandwich wrapped in two halves. Neat note pads. Everything's in methodical order.

spreads Thousand Island on the sandwich. He glances up at the visor. He tilts it down, peering at Annie's business card, wondering what to do. Will he call her? 
He sits a moment, fighting a wave of sadness. Unhappy with himself. With his life. His place in the world.

FROM THE FLOOR UP PAST MAX + THE STEERING WHEEL (VFX - GRN SCRN)    * 
up THROUGH the windshield is the twinkle of stars in the night sky. Suddenly, a dark shape from above blacks out the sky. It descends towards us. As Max takes a bite... 
...WHAM! SOMETHING HUGE rocks the cab on its axles! GLASS rains down. A HEADLIGHT EXPLODES! The windshield FRACTURES! Max bounces off the ceiling. His submarine deconstructs all over the interior. His coffee spills... 
...and then abrupt, stunning silence. 
What hit him. An earthquake?   Max takes a dazed beat.   He peers at the windshield... 
THE DEAD FACE OF A FAT MAN STARES AT HIM. Max recoils with a yell, scrambles from the cab, heart pounding... 
24    EXT. ALLEY - FROM ABOVE:   CAB - NIGHT                        24    *

MAX Well, yeah. Yeah. Guy fell on my motherfucking cab from up there...! 
Max looks up, points again, as if Vincent might have missed it        * the first time. Vincent's focus hasn't left Max.                      * 
MAX (CONT'D) I think he's dead. 
VINCENT ...taken two .45s and did a high dive onto his head. It's a good guess. 
Max stares at Vincent. It's sinking in. Vincent, meanwhile,           * has to make his decision. About Max. Kill him and find another, or... 
MAX You - you killed him? 
VINCENT No. I - I shot him.     The bullets and the fall killed him. 
A frozen beat. Everything's out in the open. Max realizes he's in trouble. He backs away, thinking escape... 
VINCENT The engine is already on. Put the little pointer on the letter "D." "D" stands for Drive.

It cruises down the street and stops in front of the apartment building. 
RAY FANNING emerges from the car. Edged hair, an earring,             * sports clothes. A salesman or a player or a dealer. Forties, a face with character and some miles. And something insistent about his intent... 
He heads towards the entry gate, rings a buzzer. Waits a moment. Rings again. Nothing. Plus...he looks like he could kick your ass if he wanted to. 
He pulls a thin plastic card from an inner pocket of his jacket, jimmies the door lock... 
28    INT. APARTMENT BUILDING COURTYARD, THIRD FLOOR - FANNING -       28   * NIGHT 
approaches across the balcony walkway against the junky palms and downtown skyscape. 
He knocks on the door...causing the door to swing in slightly. He glances down, sees the lock was pulled. Tensing, he fades to one side, his hand going to his holster at his hip. 
He draws a Beretta, reaches out and pushes the door all the way open... 
29    INT. APARTMENT - NOTHING - NIGHT                               29 
A dark shambles. Old take-out. A TV. Fanning enters                   * cautiously, alert for the slightest movement or sound.

THE BROKEN WINDOW 
Glass missing. He leans out. A dizzying drop. A halo of broken glass on the alley below...in the center of which is a big blank spot. 
FANNING Fuck. 
And he produces his police radio and we realize he's a cop. 
31   INT. CAB, TRAVELING - MAX - NIGHT                              31 
Max winds his way through surface-street traffic, in shock, sneaking anxious glances at Vincent in back. Vincent's got the tablet PC from his briefcase, studying it. The silence is thick. 
Max's hand is shaking. He lifts it off the wheel, tries to steady his fingers. Vincent diverts some attention to Max... 
VINCENT (O.S.) Try deep breathing. 
MAX What? 
VINCENT Adrenaline's wearing off. You get shaky after. Some people slip into shock. It's not uncommon. Deep breathing helps. 
Max starts drawing in breaths, letting them out slowly. 
VINCENT (CONT'D) Is that better? 
MAX I think so. 
They stop at a RED LIGHT. Max glances at the passenger seat. Dressing and stray pieces of lettuce and mortadella. He parks the gearshift and goes for the paper towels, cleaning up. 
Vincent over the tablet PC, taking in Max.    Softly:               *

MAX It's a mess. 
VINCENT So? 
Max keeps wiping, as if getting the seats clean might put everything right again. 
VINCENT (CONT'D) Lady Macbeth. Leave the seats. The light's green. We're sitting here. 
A CAR HORN HONKS behind Max.       The car whips around them to get through the intersection. 
DRIVER Asshole! 
VINCENT You no longer have the cleanest cab in La-La Land. You gotta live with that.                     * Focus on the job. Drive.

Vincent nods. We have a deal. He eases something from his waistband. Max knows. His heart is in his throat. 
DANIEL (CONT'D) And one more thing. Those guys and                       * their man, here, what's his name,                        * Felix?                                                   *

Daniel pours himself that drink. He lifts his shot glass, hand trembling slightly, knocks it back. Sets the glass down.

VINCENT Stay three paces in front of me and one to my left... 
Max, seeing the innocent people along the walls, complies. Vincent sees in the ceiling a security camera mounted in a Perspex hemisphere and averts his face towards Max... 
VINCENT (CONT'D) Flowers?

MAX No. 
FELIX Do you believe in Santa Claus? 
MAX No. 
FELIX Neither do I. (beat) But my children do. They are still small. But do you know who they like even better than Santa Claus? His helper, Pedro Negro. Black Peter. There's an old Mexican tale that tells of how Santa Claus got so very busy looking out for the good children that he had to hire some help to look out for the bad children. So he hired Pedro. And Santa Claus gave him a list with all the names of all the bad children, and Pedro would come every night to check them out. And the people, the little kids that were misbehaving, that were not saying                        * their prayers, Pedro would leave a little wooden donkey on their windows. And he would come back and if the children were still misbehaving, he would take them away and nobody would ever see them again. Now, if I am Santa Claus and you are Pedro, how do you think jolly old Santa Claus would feel if one day Pedro came into his office and said, 'I lost the list.'? How FUCKING FURIOUS do you think Santa Claus would get?!

ANNIE Annie Farrell. 
MAX (gasping for breath) Annie...it's Max. 
ANNIE (uncertain) Max... 
MAX Max, the cab driver! 
ANNIE (beat) Max? (glances at clock) ...kind of a strange time to be calling... 
MAX Listen! Listen, okay? There's a man. His name's Vincent. He's come to kill you! 
ANNIE He's...what? Where are you...?                         * 
MAX (shouting) Kill you! He is coming to kill you! 
ANNIE (beat) Is this a joke?   'Cause it is not funny.

enters. The sidewalk is elevated above the lobby. Through the brightly-lit glass walks Max sees the lobby is strangely vacant.        * No security guards. (Then he SEES a LONG SMEAR OF BLOOD across          * the white stone...)

WHACK! Vincent swings it again, instantly severing the 16th floor's power and telephone trunk line. Sparks emit from the bundled cables in the thick conduit. He tosses the ax, exits into the hallway, jabs the elevator button...

Max hurls a steel trash can at the glass wall with all his might. It just bounces off. 
Max pauses, stymied. He raises Vincent's H+K clumsily in one hand, braces himself, squeezes the trigger. Nothing. Is there a safety on this thing? He finds it. 
He tries again. FIRES TWO SHOTS into the glass door. The gun almost kicks out of his hand. But the door disintegrates. He walks through... 
103    INT. 16TH FLOOR FILES SECTION - NIGHT                               103 
Annie, frozen with indecision.       What to do?    Stay or go? 
(In keeping with the building's design, a WALL OF GLASS separates this area from the corridor beyond, which is separated by glass from other offices and the lobby. Normally, you'd be able to see people working, walking the hallway.) 
Right now, the corridor's dark.       Terrifying. 
She forces herself to move, to cross the office, run now...for the door to the...

She backs up, against the floor-to-ceiling windows. Frozen.               * Heart pounding. Listening. Against the city at night out the windows...                                                                *

...where she backs past file cabinets. Not deep enough. Nowhere to hide. So she backs along the glass. Nothing now but the CITY GLOW spilling faintly through the windows. Low shelves of legal books. Tables offering no cover. While... 
A SHADOW 
tracks against the city laid out to the south, the 110 and 10 like arteries carrying white and red cells (headlights and taillights)... 
ANNIE crouches under a table and crawls backwards. She can't hear a thing. Her heart pounds. The silence makes her want to scream. 
A POV of empty, scary office. Over the table, b.g., is the glass wall running the length of the office area. The corridor beyond. Empty. 
A SHADOW...? Did she see a shadow pass against the murky darkness out there? 
A soft sound.    Feet on carpet. Did she hear it?     Is she imagining it?    The breath catches in her throat.    Eyes wide. 
THE SHADOW 
in the bullpen by a corridor.      It lurks, silently.    Waiting. It's Vincent. 
FRONTAL:   VINCENT 
And then he moves.     Softly.   Quietly...

OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01 
FADE IN: 
1   EMPTY ROOM WITH SINGLE CHAIR                                  1 
We hear a DOOR OPEN and CLOSE, followed by APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS. DANNY OCEAN, dressed in prison fatigues, ENTERS FRAME and sits. 
VOICE (O.S.) Good morning. 
DANNY Good morning. 
VOICE (O.S.) Please state your name for the record. 
DANNY Daniel Ocean. 
VOICE (O.S.) Thank you. Mr. Ocean, the purpose of this meeting is to determine whether, if released, you are likely to break the law again. While this was your first conviction, you have been implicated, though never charged, in over a dozen other confidence schemes and frauds. What can you tell us about this? 
DANNY As you say, ma'am, I was never charged. 
2   INT. PAROLE BOARD HEARING ROOM - WIDER VIEW - MORNING         2 
Three PAROLE BOARD MEMBERS sit opposite Danny, behind a table. 
BOARD MEMBER #2 Mr. Ocean, what we're trying to find out is: was there a reason you chose to commit this crime, or was there a reason why you simply got caught this time? 
DANNY My wife left me. I was upset.    I got into a self-destructive pattern.

BOARD MEMBER #3 If released, is it likely you would fall back into a similar pattern? 
DANNY She already left me once. I don't think she'll do it again just for kicks. 
Glances dart between the Board Members. 
BOARD MEMBER #1 Mr. Ocean, what do you think you would do if released? 
Danny considers. 
DANNY (deadpan) I don't know. How much do you guys make a year? 
3   INT. MINIMUM-SECURITY PRISON - CHECK-OUT STATION - DAY         3 
GUARD #2 Ocean, Daniel. 
Danny steps forth, and GUARD #1 doles out his possessions and a form certifying their return to Danny. 
GUARD #2 Sign. (adding a piece of mail to the pile) This came today for you. Rest'll be forwarded to your parole officer. 
GUARD #1 (reading its return address over Danny's shoulder) Those your lawyers? 
DANNY My wife's. 
He opens the letter, and as his eyes gaze over the papers within, he smirks just a little. 
GUARD #1 What's it say? 
(CONTINUED)

DANNY I'm a free man. 
4    INT. CHANGING CUBICLE                                         4 
Danny pulls on civilian clothes and there's not a bare thread among them. He tugs his cuffs and smiles: The old skin feels good. One last item to don: a silver wedding band. Danny considers it. Will he put it on? 
5    EXT. MINIMUM-SECURITY PRISON - FRONT GATE - AFTERNOON         5 
A sign reads: "NEW JERSEY STATE MINIMUM-SECURITY CORRECTIONAL FACILITY." Someone has graffitied below it: "If you were in prison, you'd be home now." 
The great metal door opens, and Danny stands within its frame, ready for release. (If it matters -- and if you notice -- he's wearing his wedding ring.) 
He hovers   there for a moment, on the precipice of freedom.    The WIND WHISTLES a little on the other side of the gate,   and the view ahead is not pleasant (New Jersey):    Life is hard out there. 
But Danny musters his courage, then takes his first step into free America... 
A6   EXT. ATLANTIC CITY BOARDWALK - DUSK                           A6 
Any empty wintery boardwalk. 
6    INT. CASINO (ATLANTIC CITY) - NIGHT                           6 
... And his wingtip lands squarely on plush red carpeting. 
As we PULL UP TO Danny's face and SPIN AROUND him, we hear, then see the BUZZ of a CASINO floor: the HUM of CONVERSATION, the DING-DING-DING and THUNK-THUNK-THUNK from the SLOTS, the brisk WHIR of SHUFFLED CARDS. 
And to Danny, it's a hearth and fire and a comfy chair and a snifter of brandy. He's home. 
ON DANNY'S WALLET 
As he pulls out several crisp one hundreds, sets them on green felt, then sees them replaced by a neat pile of chips. 
7   AT BLACKJACK TABLE                                            7 
Danny cranes his neck about the casino, looking for someone -- a friend, somebody who should be here -- but without success. He turns his attention back to his cards, and the cards of the dealer. 
Nine-ten. Stay. Dealer -- seventeen. Danny wins. King-four. Dealer shows a six. Stick. Dealer busts. Queen-ace. Twenty-one. Danny wins again. 
A second dealer relieves the first, and Danny recognizes him with a smile -- this wasn't the friend he was scouting for, but two hours out of the joint any familiar face is welcome. 
DANNY Hello, Frank. 
TISHKOFF But what am I saying? You guys are pros, the best. I'm sure you can make it out of the casino. Of course, lest we forget, once you're out the front door, you're still in the middle of the fucking desert! 
Both Danny and Rusty look chastened. 
RUSTY You're right. (to Danny) He's right. 
DANNY Reuben, you're right. Our eyes are bigger than our stomachs. 
RUSTY That's exactly it. Pure ego. 
TISHKOFF Yeah yeah blah blah. 
DANNY Thank you so much for setting us straight. Sorry we bothered you. 
They both rise to go. 
TISHKOFF Look, we all go way back. I owe you from that thing with the guy in the place, and I'll never forget it. 
DANNY It was our pleasure. 
RUSTY I'd never been to Belize. 
(CONTINUED) 
30   CONTINUED:                                                      30 
TISHKOFF Give Dominic your addresses, I got some remaindered furniture I wanna send you. 
Danny and Rusty begin to circle the pool to leave. Tishkoff, of course, won't let them go that easily. 
TISHKOFF Just out of curiosity, which casinos did you geniuses pick to rob? 
Danny stops, almost as if he's been waiting for this question, which of course he has. 
DANNY The Bellagio, Mirage, and the M.G.M. Grand. 
TISHKOFF (nostrils flared, smelling a rat) Those are Terry Benedict's casinos. 
RUSTY Say, you know, he's right. 
Tishkoff waves them back, sipping on his umbrellaed cocktail. 
TISHKOFF You guys... Whadda you got against Terry Benedict? 
DANNY What do you have against him? That's the real question. 
TISHKOFF He torpedoed my casino, muscled me out, now he's gonna blow it up next month to make way for another fuckin' eyesore. Don't think I don't see what you're doin'. 
RUSTY What are we doing, Reuben? 
(CONTINUED) 
OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01                                 21. 
30   CONTINUED:    (2)                                              30 
TISHKOFF You gonna steal from Terry Benedict, you better goddamn know. This sorta thing used to be civilized. You'd hit a guy, he'd whack you. Done. But Benedict... (bristles) At the end of this he better not know you're involved, not know your names, or think you're dead. Because he'll kill you, and then he'll go to work on you. 
DANNY That's why we've got to be very careful. We have to be precise. We have to be well-funded. 
TISHKOFF Yeah, you gotta be nuts, too. And you're gonna need a crew as nuts as you are. (pregnant silence) Who do you have in mind? 
Danny and Rusty both smile; they've hooked their fish. And so it begins... 
RUSTY (V.O.) Alright.   Who's in? 
DANNY (V.O.) Frank C. is in. 
31   INT. CASINO OFFICE (ATLANTIC CITY)                             31 
Frank Catton coughs mightily into a handkerchief.   Across a desk, his boss fills out paperwork. 
DANNY (V.O.) Frank C. has developed a bad case of bronchitis and is putting in for a transfer to warmer climates. 
32   EXT. LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - DAY                                   32 
Frank carries his bag toward the taxi bay. He stops to light a cigarette, inhales with deep satisfaction before a banner: "WELCOME TO LAS VEGAS." 
DANNY (V.O.) What about drivers? 
OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01                               22. 
33   EXT. VACANT, WEEDY DRAG RACETRACK - DAY                      33 
CLOSE ON a souped-up tractor-wheeled monster truck, its ENGINE ROARING before a starting line, itching to cross it. Now take a step back... 
That souped-up monster truck stands a foot-and-a-half off the ground and sprouts an antenna from its back bumper. It's a remote-controlled toy. 
The ROARING ENGINE comes from the vehicle next to it: an actual monster truck. Both vehicles peer down the track at a finish line a hundred yards away. This is a race. 
The drivers stare each other down: TURK (behind the wheel of the truck) and VIRGIL (track-side, remote control in hand) MALLOY. They're nice boys. Really. Peckerwoods, sure, but nice. 
RUSTY (V.O.) I talked to the Malloys yesterday. 
DANNY (V.O.) The Mormon twins? 
RUSTY (V.O.) They're both in Salt Lake City, six months off the job. I got the sense they're having trouble filling the hours. 
Lights flash red-to-yellow-to-green and while the TRUCK COATS RUBBER on the track, Virgil's toy zips to a lead. It's looking to be an embarrassment for Turk until he jerks his wheel a little and -- ka-thunk -- flattens his brother's vehicle. 
Virgil pouts as he plucks up the wreckage of his entry. 
DANNY (V.O.) Electronics? 
RUSTY (V.O.) Livingston Dell. 
34   INT. SURVEILLANCE VAN - DAY                                  34 
On a black and white monitor: Two mobsters, on a meet in a public park, peer over their shoulders, making certain no one is watching them. Little do they know... 
... LIVINGSTON DELL, audio-visual junkie, and victim of a continual flop sweat, crouches before their image, masterfully controlling his surveillance camera with a joystick in his left hand. He is flanked by FBI MEN.

RUSTY (V.O.) Livingston's been doing freelance surveillance work of late for the F.B.I. Mob Squad. 
DANNY (V.O.) How are his nerves? 
RUSTY (V.O.) Okay. (beat) Not so bad you'd notice. 
As a FBI Man reaches to adjust a monitor... 
LIVINGSTON D-don't, don't-don't... touch... it. 
FBI MAN #1 What? 
ANNOUNCER (V.O.) (in Chinese, then English) Ladies and gentlemen: the amazing Yen. 
A funambulist (YEN) begins his high-wire act... 
DANNY So he can walk on a rope. 
RUSTY More than that. 
DANNY So he can juggle. We need a grease man, not an acrobat. Who else is on the list? 
RUSTY He is the list.

DANNY Who else? 
RUSTY Watch. 
Halfway across the wire, the funambulist sits. And very slowly, but without hesitation, he contorts himself into a ball, never losing his balance. Even Danny is impressed. 
RUSTY There's your grease man. 
43   EXT. SANTA MONICA PIER PARKING LOT - DAY                     43 
Danny and Rusty exit the circus tent, head for their car. 
DANNY We need Saul. 
RUSTY He won't come. He swore off the game a year ago. 
DANNY He get religion? 
RUSTY Ulcers. 
DANNY You can ask him. 
Rusty stops, stares at Danny, sighs. 
(CONTINUED) 
43   CONTINUED:                                                      43 
RUSTY I can ask. 
44   EXT. DOG TRACK/BETTING WINDOW (MIAMI, FLA) - DAY                44 
SAUL BLOOM, 50s, befuddled, wearing a corduroy jacket patched at the elbows and a duffer's hat, counts out money through the window, lists his bets. He checks his tickets, plunges them into his pants pocket, and moves off... 
45   THROUGH TRACK LOBBY                                             45 
Rusty appears in the f.g. behind a pillar, as dapper as Saul is down-at-heel, watching him go. When Saul disappears into the tunnel, he moves. 
46   IN INFIELD                                                      46 
Saul sits on one of the long, general admission steps under the box seats. He produces an orange from his pocket, starts to peel it. A pair of well-shined shoes appears behind him. Saul senses their presence, but doesn't turn around. 
SAUL I saw you in the paddock before the second race, outside the men's room, when I placed my bet. I saw you before you even got up this morning. 
RUSTY How ya been, Saul? 
SAUL Never better. 
RUSTY What's with the orange? 
SAUL My doctor says I need vitamins. 
RUSTY So why don't you take vitamins? 
For the first time, Saul cranes his neck and shoots a look up at Rusty. 
(CONTINUED) 
46   CONTINUED:                                                     46 
SAUL You come here to give me a physical? 
RUSTY I got a box seat. Come on. 
47   EXT. BOX SEATS - LATER                                         47 
A waiter serves coffee to Rusty and Saul. 
RUSTY I thought you drank bloody Mary's at the track, Saul. 
SAUL A man shouldn't drink on the job. 
RUSTY (re: race) Who we rooting for here? 
SAUL Number four. 
There's the BELL; the electronic rabbit is released and the dogs break out of the gate. From this point on Saul's eyes never leave the race. 
SAUL You gonna ask me? Or should I just say no and get it over with? 
RUSTY Saul, you're the best there is. You're in Cooperstown. What do you want? 
SAUL Nothin'. I got a duplex now, I got wall-to-wall and a goldfish, I'm seeing a nice lady, she works the unmentionables counter at Macy's. I've changed. 
RUSTY Guys like us don't change, Saul. We stay sharp or we get sloppy, but we don't change. 
SAUL Quit connin' me. 
(CONTINUED) 
47   CONTINUED:                                                    47 
They watch the race. 
RUSTY That your hound way in the back there? 
SAUL He breaks late. Everyone knows this. 
On the track: The dogs are now coming around the back stretch, and the crowd on the bleachers rises, cheering. 
SAUL You gonna treat me like a grownup at least? Tell me what the scam is? 
Under the noise: Rusty leans in and whispers in Saul's ear. Saul's eyes widen, then glaze over as all around him people are standing and shouting. 
Rusty places an envelope in Saul's lap, then gets up and walks out as, on the track, the #4 dog crosses the finish line... last by several lengths. 
Saul considers his options. In one hand: a fan of losing tickets. In the other (courtesy of Rusty): a ticket to Las Vegas. 
DANNY (V.O.) And Saul makes ten. 
48   INT. BAR - NIGHT                                              48 
TISHKOFF What, you guys get a group rate or something? 
57   INT. TISHKOFF'S LIVING ROOM - LATER                               57 
Along one wall, a buffet table has been set up, and while Virgil and Turk pile shrimp onto plates, Saul pockets an orange for later. 
TURK You make it out to Utah much, Saul?

SAUL (last man you'd see in the Tabernacle) Not as much as I'd like. 
TURK You should.   You'd like it.   You'd like Provo. 
VIRGIL (scarfing a jumbo shrimp) Anybody see the salsa goes with this? 
At the wet bar, Basher mixes a drink for Livingston; on a couch, Yen balances coffee-table ornaments into a skyscraper, to Frank's astonishment. In a corner, off on his own, Linus watches the company, his eyes narrowing, wary. Until... 
DANNY (O.S.) Gentlemen:    welcome to Las Vegas. 
Danny stands at the top of the stairs leading into the room, flanked by Rusty and Tishkoff. He starts down... 
DANNY Everybody eaten? Good. Everybody sober? Close enough. Most of you know each other already. You probably haven't met Linus Caldwell before, he's Bobby's kid outta Chicago. 
Linus trades nods around the room. 
DANNY Okay. Before we start, nobody's on the line here yet. What I'm about to propose to you happens to be both highly lucrative and highly dangerous. If that doesn't sound like your particular brand of vodka, help yourself to as much food as you like and safe journey. No hard feelings. (pauses, soberly) Otherwise, come with me. 
He turns and walks out of the living room, into another. Rusty is close behind; he turns briefly, casts an eye over the assembled and keeps going. The guys look each other over, sizing things up.

BASHER What the hell. 
And he follows, along with Frank and Livingston. Then Virgil, Turk and Yen. Then Saul. That leaves Linus, watching the line of men disappear. He turns to find Tishkoff by his side, staring at him. 
LINUS Hi. 
TISHKOFF You're Bobby Caldwell's kid, huh? 
LINUS Yeah. 
TISHKOFF From Chicago? 
LINUS Yeah. 
TISHKOFF It's nice there. You like it? 
LINUS Yeah. 
TISHKOFF That's wonderful. Get in the goddamn room. 
58   INT. GAME ROOM                                                 58 
A tournament-level pool table holds center stage here. Atop its green felt sits a raised, elaborate miniature of Terry Benedict's Las Vegas: three casinos and hotels with the Strip running between them. 
As the eleven surround the table and the model... 
DANNY Gentlemen: the 14000 block of Las Vegas Boulevard. Otherwise known as the Bellagio, the Mirage, the M.G.M. Grand. Together, they're the three most profitable casinos in Las Vegas...

Danny removes the Strip from the model. Revealed beneath is a complex substructure, featuring three tunnels, each leading from a casino to a single freight-sized elevator shaft which descends into an enormous vault. 
DANNY Gentlemen: the Bellagio vault. Located below the Strip, beneath two hundred feet of solid earth. It safeguards every dime that comes through each of the three casinos above it. (beat) And we're going to rob it. 
Everyone takes a breath, awed. 
LINUS Smash-and-grab job, huh? 
RUSTY It's a little more complicated than that. 
Danny picks up a remote control and flips on a panel of Tvs. 
DANNY Courtesy of Frank Catton, new blackjack dealer at the Bellagio, security tapes from the three casinos. 
On the monitors: three montages of black-and-white security tapes, starting within the three casinos' cages, moving into the tunnels, then (as the TVs unite in their images) pushing into the elevator and eventually the vault. 
As the group's glances shoot back and forth from the TV to the corresponding section of the model, i.e. from a POV of the tunnel to the miniature tunnel itself...

DANNY Okay.    Bad news first. This place houses   a security system which rivals   most nuclear missile silos. First:    we have to get within the casino   cages -- 
RUSTY (indicating) -- here, here, and here -- 
DANNY -- which anyone knows takes more than a smile. Next: through these doors, each of which requires a different six-digit code changed every twelve hours. Past those lies the elevator, and this is where it gets tricky: the elevator won't move without authorized fingerprint identifications -- 
RUSTY -- which we can't fake -- 
DANNY -- and vocal confirmations from both the security center within the Bellagio and the vault below - - 
RUSTY -- which we won't get. 
DANNY Furthermore, the elevator shaft is rigged with motion detectors -- 
RUSTY -- meaning if we manually override the lift, the shaft's exit will lock down automatically and we'll be trapped. 
DANNY Once we've gotten down the shaft, though, then it's a walk in the park: just three more guards with Uzis and predilections toward not being robbed, and the most elaborate vault door conceived by man. Any questions?

Silence. For a moment, each man keeps his two dozen questions or more to himself. At last, one speaks up... 
The Amazing Yen.    In Cantonese.   Of course, no one understands him.    Except Rusty. 
RUSTY (in response) No. Tunneling is out. There are Richter scales monitoring the ground for one hundred yards in every direction. If a groundhog tried to nest there, they'd know about it. Anyone else? 
Another silence. Either the guys are too dumbfounded by that bilingual exchange or too numbed by the task ahead of them to speak. 
TURK You said something about good news... 
69   INT. BELLAGIO SECURITY CENTER - EYE IN THE SKY               69 
As the balloons fill the frame of one monitor... 
SLIM 433, we have visual impairment on the east door camera. 
70   INT. BELLAGIO CASINO - BY CAGE DOOR - NIGHT                  70 
The SENTRY (#433) hears this and spots the balloons covering the embedded camera and approaches the delivery boy (who by freak accident happens to be Virgil Malloy)... 
SENTRY Excuse me, sir: You're going to have to move your balloons. 
... but Virgil's too busy picking a fight with the Tourist (surprise, surprise: Turk Malloy) to listen. 
VIRGIL Who you calling 'bud,' pal? 
TURK (TOURIST) Who you calling 'pal,' friend? 
VIRGIL Who you calling 'friend'... (can't think of another) ... bud... 
And with the Sentry out of position... 
... Livingston (dressed now in a technician's uniform, don't worry about how he got it) goes quickly to the door and swipes the newly-acquired keycard and when it flashes red-to-green, he enters...

A giant walk-in closet/switchboard full of wires, plugs, lights, etc. Livingston goes to work: 
FLURRY OF SHOTS 
He splices into all sorts of wires and lines and cables. Meanwhile... 
75   INT. BELLAGIO CASINO - BY CAGE DOOR - NIGHT                 75 
... Virgil and Turk argue, nose-to-nose, "accidentally" blocking the Sentry from the balloons... 
VIRGIL You hear about this new medical discovery they made? It's called a 'sense of direction.' Apparently we're all supposed to have one... 
TURK Yeah yeah yeah, whatever, balloon boy. 
SENTRY Gentlemen, gentlemen... 
76   INT. CIRCUITRY ROOM                                             76 
Livingston's work here is almost done: he clips a small mechanism (known in his industry as a "spider" -- it's small, black, antenna-less and hides in dark places) to a main conduit, then verifies a tiny receiver he holds is picking up the spider's feed. 
One last click into place... 
77   INT. BELLAGIO SECURITY CENTER - EYE IN THE SKY                  77 
... causes a brief, unnoticed blip on Slim's monitors... 
78   INT. BELLAGIO - LIVINGSTON'S ROOM - NIGHT                       78 
... and transmits all the views of the cages onto the monitors upstairs. Danny and Rusty witness their appearance. 
DANNY Why do they paint hallways that color? 
RUSTY They say taupe is very soothing. 
79   INT. CAGE - HALLWAY                                             79 
Livingston steps outside. His job done, he exhales and wipes the sweat from his brow and checks his palm for directions and... 
Whoops. His sweat just smeared the ballpoint. He's flying blind. He looks left down a corridor, then right, trying to remember which way he came from. No idea. 
80   INT. BELLAGIO - LIVINGSTON'S ROOM                               80 
DANNY Uh-oh. 
81   INT. CAGE - HALLWAY                                             81 
MOVING WITH Livingston as he tries to find his way out. He takes a left... 
Whoops again: here comes Fat, dead ahead.    Livingston has no recourse but to march right by him. 
(CONTINUED) 
81   CONTINUED:                                                       81 
FAT Hiya. 
LIVINGSTON Fine, thanks. 
Livingston continues on, and maybe for a second he thinks he's in the clear, especially when he sees the exit looming ahead, but then Fat turns behind him and hails him back... 
FAT Hey... 
82   INT. BELLAGIO CASINO - BY CAGE DOOR - NIGHT                      82 
At last, the Sentry outmaneuvers Virgil and Turk and grabs the balloons himself. Virgil quickly snatches them back... 
VIRGIL Hey... get your own balloons. 
83   INT. CAGE - HALLWAY                                              83 
Livingston approaches the exit's keypad and swipes his keycard: the light does not flash red-to-green. 
FAT (on his tail) Hey... 
Livingston looks: he swiped the wrong side of his keycard. He tries again. Red flashes to green. He pulls the door... 
... but Fat blocks it.       Livingston peers up, certain he's had it. 
84   INT. BELLAGIO - LIVINGSTON'S ROOM                                84 
Danny and Rusty simultaneously lean forward. 
85   INT. CAGE - HALLWAY                                              85

Fat holds out Livingston's receiver and drops it in his hand. 
(CONTINUED) 
SAUL My name is Lyman Zerga... My name is Lyman Zerga... 
Danny passes him an envelope full of $100 bills. 
DANNY There's a little over twenty grand there, Saul. Try to make it last. 
Saul pats down his pockets for something he can't find... 
SAUL You seen my... 
DANNY (handing him Rolaids) Bought you a fresh roll. 
The limo pulls to a stop, and outside there is a flurry of FOOTSTEPS before Saul's door swings open, and Turk and Virgil (both costumed as bodyguards) stand waiting for him. 
VIRGIL Mr. Zerga, we're here. 
DANNY Good luck, Lyman. 
SAUL (hesitates, then gets out) Luck is for losers. 
92   INT. BELLAGIO CASINO - DAY                                   92 
Saul, as Lyman Zerga, makes as low-profile an entrance into the Bellagio as he can with bodyguards preceding and trailing him. He approaches a V.I.P CONCIERGE... 
V.I.P. CONCIERGE Good afternoon, sir. How can I be of service?

V.I.P. CONCIERGE Do you have a reservation with us? 
SAUL (long glare at him) I don't make reservations. 
A longer glance at Lyman's bodyguards tells the Concierge this is not a man to be denied. As he jumps to it... 
A93   INT. OUTSIDE RESTAURANT'S ENTRANCE - DAY                        A93 
Outside a restaurant's entrance, Rusty and Linus sit before two slot machines, idly dropping in quarters as they watch Saul receive the royal treatment. 
RUSTY Okay.   Tell me about Benedict. 
LINUS The guy is a machine. 
93    EXT. BELLAGIO CASINO - DAY (SUPER SLOW MOTION)                  93 
TERRY BENEDICT emerges from a Town Car and, from his haircut to his smile to his pant-cuffs, he is effortless perfection. He is Vegas royalty, yet he denies eye contact to no man. He strides into his casino and, appearing behind a pillar, Linus follows him in. 
LINUS (V.O.) He arrives at the Bellagio every day at two p.m. Same Town Car, same driver. Remembers every valet's name on the way in. Not bad for a guy worth three-quarters of a billion. 
94    INT. BELLAGIO - ELEVATOR BAY (SUPER SLOW MOTION)                94 
The doors open, and Terry Benedict steps out.     Linus watches from a craps table. 
LINUS (V.O.) Offices are upstairs. He works hard, hits the lobby floor at seven on the nose. 
OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01                                 57. 
95   INT. BELLAGIO CASINO - NIGHT (SUPER SLOW MOTION)               95 
From a balcony, Benedict stands overlooking the casino floor. His CASINO MANAGER approaches and they confer. 
LINUS (V.O.) Spends three minutes on the floor with his casino manager. 
RUSTY (V.O.) What do they talk about? 
LINUS (V.O.) All business. Benedict likes to know what's going on in his casinos. There's rarely an incident he doesn't know about or handle personally. 
96   INT. HIGH ROLLERS' ROOM (SUPER SLOW MOTION)                    96 
Benedict works the room. He speaks to a Japanese High Roller in Japanese, to a Swiss in German, etc. 
LINUS (V.O.) He spends a few minutes gladhanding the high rollers. He's fluent in Spanish, German and Italian, and he's taking Japanese lessons, getting pretty good at it. He's out by seven-thirty, when an assistant hands him a black portfolio. Contents: the day's take and new security codes. Then he heads to the restaurant. 
Indeed, as Benedict makes his exit, an assistant hands him a black portfolio. 
97   INT. BELLAGIO CASINO - OUTSIDE RESTAURANT                      97 
Rusty and Linus watch the entrance:    No one enters. 
LINUS Give him another ten seconds. 
Around the corner comes Benedict, carrying his black portfolio. 
LINUS As I said:   a machine. 
RUSTY And that portfolio contains the codes to all the cage doors?

LINUS Two minutes after they've been changed, he's got 'em in hand. (beat) I'll tell you: you guys picked a helluva target. He is as smart and ruthless as they come. The last guy caught cheating here, Benedict not only sent him up for ten years, he got the bank to seize the guy's home and bankrupted -- 
RUSTY -- his brother-in-law's tractor dealership, I heard. 
LINUS He doesn't just go after your knees, he goes after your livelihood. And everyone-you- ever-met's livelihood. 
RUSTY You scared? 
LINUS You suicidal? 
RUSTY Only in the morning. (beat) Now what? 
LINUS Now comes the girl... if she comes in after he does, that means they're in a snit. 
RUSTY Where's she come from? 
LINUS The museum downstairs. She's the curator there. Wait... here she is. You'll like this. 
Rusty looks up as... 
... a beautiful woman (the one Danny saw on Benedict's arm in the New York Times photo) appears. Elegantly dressed, a knockout, she moves very much in her own private space. And Rusty's face just about drops at the sight of her.

TESS Yes, Mr. Benedict. 
BENEDICT She's lovely, isn't she? (as the Seller is confused; Benedict specifies painting) I can't be the only one who was after her. 
SELLER You're the only one who met my price. 
BENEDICT Ah, but this... You can't put a price on beauty. But I shouldn't philosophize. I own casinos, after all. 
AIDE-DE-CAMP Can we get a quick shot? Mr. Santaniello has a plane to catch. 
BENEDICT Of course, of course. 
Tess understands: she is not to be part of the photo. Benedict and the Seller pose together and... 
Flash! 
102   INT. BELLAGIO ART GALLERY - LATER                              102 
The Seller exits with the Aide-De-Camp in tow. Benedict remains, enthralled by the painting. Tess appears beside him. 
TESS You like it? 
BENEDICT I like that you like it. (beat) I have some bad news from the world of high fashion. It seems Mike Tyson will be wearing red on Saturday night. Red trunks with a white stripe. 
TESS Oh?

BENEDICT And you, as I recall, will be wearing a red Donna Karan? And when the TV cameras pick us up in the front row, that red dress... 
TESS I see. 
BENEDICT He's a charming man, but no one's going to be watching him when they can make a study of you. I've asked Paolo to find three or four things for you to try. I hope you're not too disappointed. 
She is, but she buries it. 
BENEDICT Are you sure? 
She nods, smiles faintly. 
BENEDICT I'll see you tonight. 
Instinctively she leans in to kiss him.        He recoils ever so slightly. 
TESS What?    We're alone. 
He lets his eyes wander along the length of the ceiling, over all the eye-in-the-sky cameras hidden there. She follows his look. 
BENEDICT In my hotels, there's always someone watching. 
But he kisses her anyway. 
TESS I'll see you tonight. 
He glances once more on the Picasso as he moves away. 
BENEDICT Actually, I do like it. 
And Tess remains, thinking:         he's rich, he's handsome and wooing, but is she happy?

Quiet, elegant, tense. One table is operating only, in the corner, and at it Saul, as Lyman Zerga, furtively peels at the roll of Rolaids and slips one in his mouth. 
HIGH ROLLER #1 Weak stomach, Mr. Zerga? 
SAUL I don't believe in weakness. It costs too much. I don't believe in questions, either.

This shuts the High Roller up fast. Saul looks up from the table, just perceptibly, to spot Terry Benedict, on his way in, right on schedule. He approaches the PIT BOSS by the entrance. 
BENEDICT Eddie.    Anything for me? 
PIT BOSS Mr. Zerga, sir. Lyman Zerga. In the third position. Wishes to speak with you privately. 
BENEDICT Who is he? 
PIT BOSS Businessman of some kind, working mostly in Europe. He's very vague, but I asked around. Word is he deals primarily in arms. One of the biggest. 
BENEDICT Zerga?    Never heard of him. 
PIT BOSS Yessir.    That's why I don't doubt it. 
BENEDICT He's staying here? 
PIT BOSS Checked in two nights ago, sir. He's in the Mirador suite. 
BENEDICT How's he doing? 
PIT BOSS Up.   Almost forty grand. 
BENEDICT (knowing he can't duck this) Good for him...

TESS (without looking at him) You're thirty seconds late. I was about to send out a search party... (recognizing the hands, she turns, stunned) Danny... 
DANNY (standing over her, grinning) Hello, Tess. 
TESS (thrilled and petrified and stunned to see him, but outraged mostly) What are you doing here? 
DANNY I'm out. 
TESS You're out. 
DANNY Of prison. You remember. The day I went for cigarettes and never came back. You must have noticed. 
SAUL Mr. Benedict. I recognize you from the TV. You know, nine casinos out of ten, owner comes up in the middle of the hand to ask me what I want. I respect your waiting.

BENEDICT You're the guest, sir. 
SAUL And I have to impose on your hospitality. Can you sit in for a hand? 
BENEDICT I'd love to, Mr. Zerga, but the gaming board would feed me to my white tigers. 
SAUL That's a shame. You're the king of Vegas and you have to play craps in the alley. 
BENEDICT No shame at all. Reminds me of my youth. 
CORNER - MOMENT LATER 
Benedict and Saul are huddled in a corner. 
SAUL The fight is Saturday, is it not? 
BENEDICT Yes.   I can get you seats... 
SAUL No, no. Hand-to-hand combat doesn't interest me. I have a package arriving here Saturday evening. A black briefcase, standard size, the contents of which are very valuable to me. 
BENEDICT I'd be happy to put it in the house safe for you. 
SAUL The house safe is for brandy and grandmother's pearls. I'm afraid I need something more secure. 
BENEDICT I can assure you, the house safe is utterly...

SAUL (his looks stops Benedict) I can assure you, Mr. Benedict, your generosity in this matter will not go overlooked. Now: what can you offer me besides the safe? 
Saul's eyes are pure steel: he is not a man familiar with being denied. And Benedict recognizes that fact.

TESS See, the kind of people you steal things from, they have insurance to compensate them. They get made whole again. I had to leave New York to get away from what happened. How do I get my five years back, Danny? 
DANNY You can't. But what you can do is not throw away another five years. 
TESS You don't know anything about -- 
DANNY (leaning in) Listen, you don't love me anymore, you want to make a life with someone else? Fine, I'll have to live with that. But not him. 
TESS Spoken like a true ex-husband. 
DANNY I'm not joking, Tess. 
TESS I'm not laughing. (beat) You have to admit there's a conflict of interest when you give me advice about my love life. 
Danny exhales and leans back.

DANNY Yes. But that doesn't mean I'm wrong. 
She looks at him, and maybe part of her knows that he isn't. She looks down at his ring, somewhat wistful. He sees her looking at it. 
TESS Do you remember what I said to you when we first met? 
DANNY You said: you better know what you're doing. 
TESS Do you? Now? Because -- truly -- you should walk out the door if you don't. 
DANNY I know what I'm doing. 
BENEDICT What are you doing? 
Terry Benedict is hovering over them, fresh from his meeting with Saul. 
DANNY Catching up. 
TESS Terry, meet my ex-husband... 
DANNY (extending his hand) Danny Ocean.

BENEDICT 'Of all the gin joints in all the world...' (beat) You've been in prison until recently, isn't that right? How does it feel to be out? 
DANNY About the same. Everything you want is still on the other side. 
BENEDICT There's the human condition for you. 
TESS Terry, Danny was just about to... 
DANNY I just wanted to say hello.   For old time's sake. 
BENEDICT Stay for a drink, if you like. 
TESS He can't -- 
DANNY (simultaneously) -- I can't. 
An awkward silence.    Benedict takes Tess's hand in his. 
BENEDICT Well, then I don't imagine we'll be seeing you again, Mr. Ocean. 
DANNY You never know. 
BENEDICT I know everything that happens in my hotels. 
DANNY So I should put those towels back.

A cabal of city engineers investigates subterranean fuse boxes, and Basher tails them, hiding near a waterfall of effluent. 
BASHER (V.O.) They did exactly what I planned to do. Only they did it by accident. Now they know their weakness. And they're fixing it. 
An ECHOING FOOTSTEP draws the attention of the city engineers, and Basher retreats into the waterfall.

DANNY By tomorrow? 
Danny keeps pacing; Rusty hangs his head and thinks; Basher dries his hair. 
BASHER (an idea occurs to him) We could use a pinch. 
Danny stops; Rusty looks up. 
DANNY What -- is a pinch?

Scientists demonstrate the pinch, a lithium wire in a glass vacuum tube the size of a small refrigerator. 
BASHER (V.O.) A pinch is the equivalent of a cardiac arrest for any broad-band electrical circuitry. Or better yet: A pinch is a bomb... but without the bomb. Every time a nuclear weapon detonates, it unleashes an electromagnetic pulse which shuts down any power source within its vicinity. That tends not to matter in most cases because the nuclear weapon destroys everything you might need power for anyway. Now a pinch creates a similar electromagnetic pulse, but without the headache of mass destruction and death. So instead of Hiroshima, you get the Seventeenth Century.

Turk and Virgil man the front seats as Danny, Basher, Yen and Linus huddle in the back. Basher and Yen both prepare equipment for their raid: hooks and a rope for Yen, a small blowtorch and a drill for Basher. 
DANNY (to Basher and Yen) You two ready? 
They nod and, with Danny, start out the van's rear door. Linus starts to follow but... 
DANNY What are you doing? 
LINUS Coming with you. 
Danny smiles and shakes his head. 
LINUS (furious) But... (CONTINUED)

Linus twiddles his thumbs, tired of being seated at the kids' table. Meanwhile, up front, another Mensa meeting has been called to order... 
VIRGIL Are you a man? 
TURK Yes.    Nineteen. 
VIRGIL Are you alive? 
TURK Yes.    Eighteen. 
VIRGIL Evel Knievel. 
TURK Shit!   Okay, your turn... 
SAME SCENE - LATER 
VIRGIL Co-sign squared over .0455. 
Linus runs along the overhang, then leaps down, onto the reversing van, and rolls along its roof and down its windshield.

THROUGH the windshield: Virgil jabs his thumb over his shoulder: get in the back. 
DANNY (appearing from the rear doors) C'mon, c'mon... 
Linus scrambles back over the van, and Danny and Yen pull him in. Virgil hits the gas for a quick getaway, but he does so before the rear doors are closed, and one of them slams shut right on Yen's hand -- CRUNCH! 
YEN Ahhh!

DANNY I say stay in the van, you stay in the van, got it? 'Cause you lose focus for one second in this game, and someone gets hurt. 
LINUS (he's had just about enough of Danny's shit) I got it.

Livingston has moved A/V operations into Lyman Zerga's suite. As he scours the same images the watchers downstairs do, he eavesdrops on their communications through his headset. 
WATCHER (V.O.) (over Livingston's headset) Cotton couldn't be taller. 
137   IN MIRADOR SUITE BATHROOM                                      137 
Lost in the luxury his role dictates, Saul floats in a full-sized Jacuzzi and chews on a hundred dollar cigar; Reuben, meanwhile, paces the floor, nervously. 
TISHKOFF Where are they? That's what I want to know. Where are they? 
SAUL (as Lyman) They'll be here. 
TISHKOFF (to himself, mocking "Lyman") 'They'll be here.' Thanks a lot, Fidel.

He glances at his watch, then outside again as the white van arrives, dropping off only Linus and Danny, who slaps the van's roof before it pulls away. 
As Danny and Linus enter the lobby, Rusty falls into step with them, exchanging a smile with Danny but not Linus, he still looks chastised from the car-trailer.

Riding up... 
RUSTY You boys have a nice trip? 
Rusty, smiling, looks to Linus, glowering, then to Danny. Before Danny can explain the doors part at the Mirador Suite, where Livingston greets them urgently. 
LIVINGSTON We have a problem.

A mug-shot of Danny, complete with vital information: height, weight, criminal history. 
LIVINGSTON You've been red-flagged. It means the moment you step on the casino floor, they'll be watching you. Like hawks. Hawks with video cameras. 
DANNY This is a problem. 
A pall falls over the room: this is more than a problem, this is disastrous. Only SAUL dares make a noise, HUMMING and SPLASHING in the next room. 
RUSTY Saul:   time to get out. 
SAUL (O.S.) (as Lyman) It's time when I say it is. 
RUSTY Now!

A white, unmarked van pulls in from the street and races up to the curb where Saul and Benedict wait. 
Turk Malloy gets out the passenger's side, a briefcase handcuffed to his wrist, as Virgil comes around from the driver's side, both of them dressed in their bodyguard suits. 
TURK Mr. Zerga.   A gift from Mr. Hesse. 
Turk extends the briefcase to Saul, so that they both clasp the handle, as Virgil produces a key, unlocks the cuff on Turk's wrist, transfers it to Saul's, clamps it shut, and hands Saul the key. 
SAUL Thank you, Friedrich, Gunther. 
He turns, nods to Benedict, and they retreat into the hotel, the security guards and Malloys flanking them.

FRANK (as he busts) Lookin' like a bad night for the house.

BENEDICT I'm afraid I can't allow my private security personnel inside the casino cages. I hope you don't mind... 
SAUL Of course not. 
Saul turns to dismiss Virgil and Turk when... 
... passing by, on his way to a sports betting window, an old RACETRACK DENIZEN happens past this cabal and, worse yet, happens to recognize Saul. 
RACETRACK DENIZEN Saul?   Saul Bloom, is that you? 
Saul does his best to ignore the man. But even Benedict notices: this guy seems to know Lyman Zerga. 
RACETRACK DENIZEN Saul, it's me. Bucky Buchanan, remember? From Saratoga. 
At last Saul turns to face this man, with shark's eyes. 
SAUL Friedrich, Gunther. 
An order: dispose of this man. Virgil and Turk pick up the Denizen by his elbows and haul him away. 
SAUL Mr. Benedict... (gesturing to the cage; re: his briefcase-cuff) Please: I have never enjoyed the touch of steel to my skin. 
They proceed.

Linus stands dressed in a sharp, conservative suit -- a far cry from the threadbare thief in Chicago. Rusty circles him, inspecting. 
RUSTY Where you gonna put your hands? 
Linus clasps them. 
RUSTY No... 
Linus goes for his pockets. 
RUSTY Not the pockets, either. And don't touch your tie. Look at me... 
Linus does. 
RUSTY That how you gonna stand? 
Linus shifts his balance. 
RUSTY Wrong again. I ask you a question, you have to think of the answer, where you gonna look? 
Linus looks down. 
RUSTY Death. You look down, they know you're lying --

The white VAN SCREECHES to a halt inches from Basher who stands ready beside the pinch (and the now-gutted and dismantled mockup of the Bellagio vault) and faster than a NASCAR pit crew Basher, Turk and Virgil load the pinch into the white van's rear and before you can say "electromagnetic pulse" the VAN SCREECHES back out of the warehouse fully loaded.

VIRGIL Hey. What do we look like: a couple of peckerwood jackasses or something? 
No one responds. 
RUSTY (turning his attention to Yen, squeezed into the cart) Amazing: how's it feel? You alright? (as Yen nods) Want something to read? Magazine? 
From the tangle of limbs, a middle finger protrudes to show Rusty what he can do with a magazine. 
RUSTY Okay. I'm counting down.    Thirty minutes of breathing time starts... now. 
On "now" a RUNNING CLOCK APPEARS ON-SCREEN, descending from 29:59. It will REMAIN there for the duration of the pre-pinch heist, jumping at times BETWEEN SCENES. 
Rusty seals Yen inside the cash cart, then gives the top a tug: it's shut tight. As Virgil redresses it with the tablecloth, Turk snatches back Livingston's penne on the way to the door.

BENEDICT You new at the commission? 
LINUS Been there about two years. 
BENEDICT I know Hal Lindley over there. You work with him at all? 
LINUS (a pause; will he pass?) Not since he died last year.

TISHKOFF Good evening, Marcel. My nieces and I would like a table. Something quiet before the fight. 
MAITRE D' I can put you at 19 in just a couple minutes. 
TISHKOFF Quick as you can. (re: the girls) The meter's running here. 
The Maitre d' turns to his next customer:         Tess.   She, of course, merits a table instantly. 
MAITRE D' Good evening, Miss Ocean.    Right this way... 
Reuben can't help but stare as Tess passes by. His eyes linger a little too long and a little too low...

TESS Danny:    No. 
DANNY I'll just be a moment. 
TESS I'm having you thrown out of here. 
She starts past him; he grabs her arm to keep her, and she wheels on him. 
TESS You're up to something, Danny. What? And don't say you came here for me. You're pulling a job, aren't you? 
DANNY Tess... 
TESS Well, know this: no matter what it is, you won't win me back. I can't afford it.

BENEDICT Please show this man off the premises. (to Frank) Don't step foot in my casino again. 
FRANK (as he's led away, over his shoulder, to Linus) Cracker. 
Benedict checks his watch again:    he's really running late. 
BENEDICT Mr. Wills, if you don't mind... (as Linus forgets to respond) Mr. Wills? 
LINUS Of course. 
They start toward the exit.   But halfway there... 
LINUS My beeper.   I'm sorry.   I forgot it. 
Benedict hesitates: He's in an enormous hurry now, he's behind schedule -- he hates being behind schedule -- but leaving even a member of the Gaming Commission alone in his cage is a security risk. One glace at the cameras all about and he decides to risk it. 
BENEDICT You know how to get back out? 
LINUS Of course.   Enjoy the fight. 
BENEDICT (shaking his hand, then hurrying away) Thank you. 
Linus smiles after him, withdrawing the page of combinations he lifted off the man.

DANNY How much longer do you think Mr. Benedict will be? 
GOON #1 Just a few minutes more. 
He scans the room. 
DANNY No cameras in this room, huh? Don't want anyone seeing what happens here? 
The Goons say nothing.   Danny checks his watch. 
DANNY He's not coming, is he? 
The Goons look at each other; Danny has called their bluff. 
DANNY Who is? 
There's a KNOCK at the door, and the Goons smile: Danny's about to find out who. One Goon rises to usher in...

DANNY I guess Mr. Benedict didn't like me talking to his girl. 
The Goons shake their heads. Danny smiles at the Bruiser, and the Bruiser snarls back, showing off those gums. He rolls up his shirtsleeves, itching to tear a hole in this man. The Goons head for the door. 
GOON #1 We're gonna step outside now. Leave you two alone to talk things over. 
The Goons exit. Danny and the Bruiser face off. And as Danny opens his mouth to speak, Bruiser's fist flashes out and knocks him down. Danny rises, wiping a little blood from his lip. 
DANNY Jesus, Bruiser, not 'til later. 
BRUISER Sorry, Danny.    I -- I forgot. 
DANNY S'okay. (shaking it off) How's the wife? 
BRUISER Pregnant again.

Saul witnesses this, too, and stifles a reaction. 
WALSH Does that satisfy you, Mr. Zerga? 
SAUL Yes, I'm very satisfied. 
WALSH (to Slim) Close it up. 
On the monitor, the vault door closes, but Saul looks anything but satisfied. He's sweaty, his mouth's so dry he can't swallow, and he keeps patting down his pockets for his Rolaids, without finding them. 
FAT You alright, sir?

DANNY You looking for action? 
LINUS (shrugs) I'd go in for a buck. 
DANNY A buck it is.

Benedict enters, and fear enters with him. And, of course, Tess. As the room buzzes with activity, he keeps the cell phone pressed to his ear. 
BENEDICT What the hell is going on down there in the vault? 
FAT Nothing, sir.    All normal. 
BENEDICT Show me. 
Fat points to the security-cam view of the vault corridor and vault -- Livingston's tape. 
FAT All quiet. 
BENEDICT (on phone, venomously) I'm afraid you're mistaken. 
231   INT. MIRADOR SUITE - NIGHT                                   231 
Frank, Basher and Saul watch over Livingston's shoulder as this phone conversation is broadcast over a small speaker. 
RUSTY (V.O.) You're watching your monitor? Okay, keep watching. 
Livingston punches in numbers... 
232   INT. BELLAGIO SECURITY CENTER - EYE IN THE SKY -             232 ON FAT'S MONITOR 
New images suddenly appear. Three masked men in the vault throw stacks of money onto the floor; the three Uzi Guards lie bound and unconscious in the corridor. 
The security center, understandably, erupts in activity. 
BENEDICT Jesus Christ...

Rusty strolls so casually there's no reason anyone passing would suspect he was doing more than ordering a pizza. 
RUSTY (V.O.) In this town, your luck can change just that quickly. 
234    INT. BELLAGIO SECURITY CENTER                                  234 
BENEDICT (close to apoplectic, takes a breath and cups the phone, then barks at Walsh) Find out how much money we have down there. 
Tess, amid all this chaos, is still curious: how did that cell phone get into her handbag? And suddenly it hits her... 
A235   FLASHBACK - INT. RESTAURANT - EARLIER THAT EVENING             A235 
DANNY Good-bye. 
Danny starts for her cheek, stops to see if it's alright with her -- she, sad-eyed, does not recoil -- and then gently kisses it... 
... as he slips the cell phone into her handbag, unnoticed. 
BENEDICT (on phone) Alright. You've proved your point. You've broken into my vault. Congratulations: you're a dead man. 
Tess leaves. 
RUSTY (V.O.) Maybe. 
BENEDICT May I ask: how do you expect to leave here, hmm? 
INTERCUT WITH: 
235    INT. CASINO FLOOR                                              235 
BENEDICT Do you believe I'll simply allow you to parade bags full of my money out my casino doors? 
A distance beyond Rusty, Tess exits the cages. She stops, puzzling over what to do, happens to spot him. 
RUSTY No.   You're gonna carry it out for us. 
BENEDICT (has to laugh) And why would I do that? 
RUSTY Take a closer look at your monitor... 
OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00                              128A. 
236   INT. SECURITY CENTER                                         236 
Benedict does. As the three masked men stuff money into large canvas bags and mark the bags with X's, another portion of cash remains untouched, booby-trapped. 
RUSTY (V.O.) As your manager's probably reporting to you by now, you have a little over a hundred sixty million in your vault tonight. 
And, as if Rusty was in the room watching, Walsh approaches with the night's cash count: $163,156,759. 
RUSTY (V.O.) You may notice: we're only packing up about half that. The other half we're leaving in your vault, booby-trapped, as a hostage. 
237   INT. CASINO FLOOR                                            237

He spins and -- gasp -- comes face-to-face with Tess. She stares at him directly: she knows. 
RUSTY (holding her glance) Mr. Benedict: you can lose eighty million dollars secretly tonight or you can lose a hundred sixty million dollars publicly. It's your decision. 
He cups the phone. 
RUSTY Hi. 
238   INT. SECURITY CENTER                                           238 
Benedict cups his phone, too, and vents his rage. He knows what he should do -- let the money go -- and he knows what he wants to do -- stop these sonsabitches.   He makes his choice... 
BENEDICT (to Walsh) Make the call. 
Walsh grabs a phone, punches numbers...

Dead silence in the Eye in the Sky. Slim stares deep into a monitor's dark pitch. Then... 
SWAT FREQUENCY (V.O.) (Leader's voice) Lights! We need power now! 
Fat flips the power back on, and on the monitors... 
... visions of destruction down below... smoke fills the vault as two SWAT members push through it... other SWAT members help evacuate the unconscious guards... 
BENEDICT (into intercom) What's the situation down there? 
SWAT LEADER (V.O.) They blew it. They blew the... Oh, Jesus... If there was anyone in there, they're not in one piece anymore.

The vault elevator doors open and Terry Benedict makes his way into his smoke-filled vault corridor. He passes the Uzi Guards, awake now and stumbling to the elevator with SWAT members' assistance, then arrives before his decimated vault: Anything within -- people, money, Lyman Zerga's emeralds -- could only have been destroyed. 
OVER SWAT LEADER'S SHOULDER 
as he approaches Benedict. 
SWAT LEADER Mr. Benedict... 
BENEDICT Yes. 
SWAT LEADER We couldn't find any survivors. Or, I'm afraid, any of your money. I'm sorry, sir. 
BENEDICT (doesn't want to hear anymore; the SWAT team failed him) Take your men out now. 
HOLD ON Benedict, seething, as the SWAT Leader steps away... 
SWAT LEADER Okay, guys, grab your gear and clear out. 
BENEDICT (into walkie-talkie he has with him) Walsh: How are we with the van?

HEAD GOON Out of the van now! Hands up! 
An EMPLOYEE from the charter airline sticks his head out of his office door. 
EMPLOYEE (innocently) Hey, what's going on here? 
Half-a-dozen firearms turn and point in his direction. The Employee disappears back inside his office. 
The Head Goon cautiously approaches the van, reaches for the driver's door, and yanks it open... 
Inside: There is no driver. Just a video camera mounted at eye-level. The Head Goon cranes back his head, befuddled, when he notices for the first time (and maybe we do, too) an enormous antenna sprouting from the van's rear bumper. 
The van suddenly lurches.

complete with a tiny video monitor (displaying the van driver's POV) and a steering mechanism -- it's a near- replica of the one Virgil Malloy used in the monster truck drag race against his brother. 
And Virgil's using it now, too, as he sits next to Reuben Tishkoff in one of Reuben's Rolls and watches the Goons scramble back from the flat-tired van. 
BARRROOOOM! No one is hurt. Nor is the money, stacked neatly in a corridor, ready to be packed into the phony SWAT team bags, body armor, etc. 
281   EXT. BELLAGIO CASINO - NIGHT (PRESENT)                        281 
The SWAT team exits and boards the second vehicle Turk and Virgil have been working on all this time, the one in the warehouse with an air freshener hanging from its rearview mirror: it's a replica of a SWAT van. 
Turk takes the wheel as the others jump in the back. Rusty flips open another cell phone... 
RUSTY Las Vegas P.D. This is Officer Brooks, New Jersey Probation Division. I have a violator in your jurisdiction... (cupping phone) Hit it. 
Turk hits the gas and the VEHICLE PEELS away, carrying its cadre of new multi-millionaires far away from the Bellagio Hotel and Casino.

Bruiser throws a mean left hook across Danny's face as the door swings open and Benedict steps in. Bruiser sees him and steps away, toweling off his bloodied knuckles. 
Benedict studies Danny: the man is a bloody mess, head rolling, eyes puffed up. 
BENEDICT Wake him up. 
The Goons step in, slap Danny alert.       At last, Danny recognizes Benedict in the room. 
DANNY (a little punchy) Heya, Benedict... How's the other fight going? 
Benedict keeps his cool. 
BENEDICT Did you have a hand in this? (beat) Did you? 
DANNY Did I have a hand in what? 
Benedict scrutinizes Danny: Is he bluffing?       He looks at Bruiser, then Danny again, and decides: no. 
BENEDICT Get him out of here. 
As the Goons scoop him up and drag him out, Danny catches Bruiser's eye for just a moment. And barely winks.

INT. EXAM ROOM - DAY 
We're not exactly sure where we are. And we're not exactly sure who's talking. All we know is that we are looking at a foot. One bare foot with chipped red polish. 
ZOE (V.O.) I can't believe I didn't get a pedicure for this. How embarrassing. Look at that... 
The toes open and then curl down as if trying to hide. 
ZOE (V.O.)(CONT'D) What's wrong with me? If I were with a real guy doing this, I would've gotten a pedicure. And a wax. I'm pathetic. 
The CAMERA PANS to the other foot, which is also chipped. 
ZOE (V.O.) (CONT'D) Fuck, that one's even worse. And when did my toes get so fat? No wonder I'm alone. I'm a fat-toed animal. 
Zoe lets out a sigh.    She speaks out-loud now. 
ZOE (CONT'D) Sorry I didn't get a pedicure. 
DR. HARRIS What? 
DR. HARRIS (mid-fifties, jovial) looks up from between Zoe's knees, the light on his head flashing right in Zoe's eyes. 
ZOE My toes...sorry. 
DR. HARRIS I'm not looking at your toes. 
ZOE Right.   Duh. 
Dr. Harris stands and takes off his gloves. 
DR. HARRIS All done. 
ZOE That's it? 
And now, for the first time, we see ZOE. Despite the paper gown and worried look on her face, she's a late-30-something, girl-next-door type. She could be your best friend. 
DR. HARRIS I'll elevate your legs for ten minutes and then you're good to go. 
He sets a kitchen timer and then pushes a button to raise her legs. We hear the loud TICK TOCK of the timer. 
ZOE This is the first time I've heard that ticking clock sound and it doesn't freak me out. 
DR. HARRIS Good.   Just relax. 
ZOE I can't, I'm totally freaking out. 
DR. HARRIS Everything's going to be great. I have a feeling you and... (checks empty syringe) Number CRM-101404 are going to make beautiful babies together. 
Zoe smiles.   Maybe he's right.   Yeah...of course he's right. 
BOBBY (V.O.) Number CRM-101404? Are you high? 
INT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - DAY 
TITLE UP: FOUR WEEKS AGO 
BOBBY, 39 (but says he's 33,) gay and gorgeous, opens a file and points to a piece of paper. 
BOBBY Says here he has red hair and freckles. 
ZOE And glasses, too. 
BOBBY And why are we picking him? 
ZOE Because he's honest. 
BOBBY He's ugly. 
Zoe points to a stack of potential donors. 
ZOE You think they're all telling the truth? If they're so smart and good looking, why are they beating off into a cup? 
BOBBY Have you ever fucked a guy with red hair and freckles? 
ZOE No, and I won't have to. 
BOBBY But what about your kid? No one's going to want to fuck your kid. (beat) That came out wrong. 
DR. HARRIS You don't have to walk like that. 
ZOE Oh.   Okay. 
Zoe separates her legs an inch.     And then closes them. 
ZOE (CONT'D) Should we hug? We might have just made a baby together. 
INT. WAITING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Zoe walks through the waiting room with her legs still pressed together. She sees two PREGNANT WOMAN, touches her own stomach and smiles. She finally feels part of this exclusive baby club. 
ZOE Hi. 
PREGNANT WOMEN Hi. 
INT. ELEVATOR - DAY 
Zoe enters the elevator where there is a WOMAN holding a BABY. Zoe smiles at them. Another member of the club... 
ZOE Hi. 
WOMAN Hi. 
The elevator descends. Zoe continues to stare at the baby with a big smile. She stares for an uncomfortably long time. 
WOMAN (CONT'D) You're starting to freak me out. 
ZOE Sorry. 
Zoe looks down.    After a beat, she sneaks another look. 
WOMAN Stop it. 
EXT. MADISON AVENUE - DAY 
It's POURING outside. The kind of rain that turns umbrellas inside out. NEW YORKERS run for cover with newspapers over their heads. 
Despite the rain, Zoe skips out of the building with her hands in the air and twirls around. Realizing that she's spread her legs too far apart, she snaps them back together. 
A WOMAN pushing a baby stroller covered in plastic runs by. 
ZOE Hi! 
Zoe looks uptown for a cab. Nope. Nothing. She starts to walk, still keeping her legs firmly pressed together. She rounds the corner towards the subway station and then, miraculously, spies a cab. 
ZOE (CONT'D) Taxi! 
She runs (little steps) across the street. 
INT. TAXI - MOMENTS LATER 
Zoe closes the door behind her. 
ZOE Hallelujah! 
As soon as the word comes out of her mouth, she notices someone entering the cab from the other side. 
This is STAN, early 40s, but looks more like a college kid -- faded jeans, t-shirt, cute, messy hair. 
ZOE (CONT'D) Uh...excuse me. This is my cab. 
STAN You own it? 
ZOE No, but I'm about to rent it. 
STAN Actually, if we're being technical, you kind of stole it. 
ZOE I don't think so. 
STAN If you see someone about to get in a cab, you can't just run in from the other side and say it's yours. 
ZOE I didn't see you. 
STAN I saw you see me. 
ZOE (to the cabbie) Sir, who saw you first? 
The CABBIE picks up his paper and starts to read. 
STAN Maybe you're not from around here, but there's a code. It's like war, even though it's brutal and bloody, there are still certain rules we-- 
ZOE Fine.   Forget it.   I'll get out. 
Zoe grabs the door handle and then turns back. 
BOBBY I tried to talk her out of it. 
JALISA Why'd you do that, Mami? 
BOBBY (to Jalisa) I know, right? 
JALISA Red pubes.     Eek... 
ZOE I'm never going to see his pubes! 
BOBBY You'll see your kid's pubes. 
ZOE I doubt it. 
BOBBY But you'll know they're there. 
ZOE What is wrong with you? 
JALISA So, what happened?    Come on... 
ZOE I lay down, put my feet up, five minutes later it was over. I barely felt a thing. 
BOBBY Sounds like Ricardo. 
JALISA Tell me about it, Papi. 
Bobby and Jalisa high five.    Bobby then turns to Zoe. 
BOBBY So...what happens now? 
ZOE Now, we wait. 
BOBBY That's no fun, I want to know if I'm going to be a fairy godmother. 
ZOE We'll just have to wait and see. 
Zoe smiles and heads for the back. 
EXT. HUDSON PETS - NIGHT 
The lights in the pet store go dark.   Moments later, Zoe, Bobby, Jalisa and Nuts exit. 
BOBBY Come on, Zoe, one drink. You can have an O'Dhouls or something. 
JALISA We'll go to the piano bar and get Bobby to sing some Ace of Base. 
BOBBY Forget it, she's not coming. I can tell by the dull look on her face. 
ZOE Love you. 
They all hug.   Bobby and Jalisa walk away arm-in-arm, singing. 
BOBBY/JALISA I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign... 
Zoe turns to lock up.   While her back is turned, Stan appears from the shadows. 
STAN Hi. 
ZOE Aahhh! 
Zoe screams and drops the keys. Nuts, overexcited by Zoe's reaction, starts to run/wheel in circles and then tips over. 
ZOE (CONT'D) You scared the hell out of me! 
STAN Oh, wow.   Is he...okay? 
Nuts is still on the ground, his wheels spinning.   Zoe sets him upright. 
ZOE What are you doing here? 
STAN I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. Or hurt your dog. Don't worry, I'm not a stalker. 
ZOE How'd you know I worked here? 
STAN I followed you after the subway. (thinks, then) That sounds a little stalkery, huh? 
ZOE Yeah. 
STAN I just really wanted to see you again. Almost like I had to see you again. Can I walk you home? (then) Is it me or does everything I say make me sound more like a stalker? 
Zoe allows a small smile. 
STAN (CONT'D) Can I just give you my card? Here. Take my card. I'm not a freak. Really. I sell cheese. 
This hangs out there for a beat. 
MONA Sure I am. 
ZOE You just told me that if I breast- feed "my girls" will end up looking like empty tube socks. 
MONA I'm just being honest. And don't even get me started on what childbirth does to your bladder. 
ZOE What does it do to your bladder? 
Mona cracks up and then stops abruptly. 
MONA I just peed a little bit. 
ZOE I don't think I'm pregnant. The doctor says it will probably take several tries. Something about frozen sperm being lazy. 
MONA Good.   Take your time. 
Zoe takes a sip of coffee and looks out the window. 
ZOE So, should I call this guy?   Do you think that would be weird? 
MONA Do I think it's weird that you're pursuing someone at the exact moment in time that you might be most unavailable? No. Because that's what you do. You sabotage. 
ZOE (ignoring her) He works at the Farmer's market. And it's right around the corner. Are you thinking what I'm thinking? 
MONA I look fat and old? 
ZOE No. 
MONA Then, no. 
ZOE Let's go spy on him. Come on. It will be fun. Like high school. 
MONA I can't. (checks watch) This twenty minute breakfast concludes my "me" time for the week. More proof that you should not have kids. 
EXT. FARMER'S MARKET - DAY 
The Farmer's Market is crowded with people. We hear the sounds of a bluegrass band playing somewhere nearby. 
Zoe spies the LITTLE GOAT sign. But Stan is not there.    She looks around the neighboring stalls for him, but no luck. 
ZOE Oh, well. 
She walks towards 14th street. We see the bluegrass band on the steps by the subway station. It's not a big band, just a few guys with an open banjo case and a sign that reads, "The Organics." The country twang of the music is in sharp contrast with the tall buildings all around. 
As she gets closer, she notices that Stan is in the band. He's playing banjo. 
Zoe quickly ducks into the nearest food stall, OLIVIA'S BERRIES. OLIVIA, mid-twenties, natural beauty, approaches. 
OLIVIA Can I help you? 
ZOE (distracted) No, I'm fine. 
Zoe watches Stan. She mindlessly starts eating some blueberries out of the display pint. Olivia sees that Zoe is looking at Stan. 
OLIVIA Tasty, huh? 
Zoe nods and takes another berry. 
OLIVIA (CONT'D) All ripe and juicy. And firm, too. Bet you could just eat him up in one bite, right? 
Zoe now turns, confused. 
ZOE What? 
OLIVIA And don't look now, but he's coming this way. 
Olivia winks and moves off. Zoe turns back and is now face- to-face with Stan, who's smiling from ear-to-ear, his banjo slung over his shoulder. 
STAN A-ha! I didn't scare you away after all. 
ZOE (trying to be casual) I was just in the neighborhood. I thought I'd come by and get some blueberries. I'm going to make a pie. 
STAN I love blueberry pie. 
Stan takes two pints of blueberries and hands them to Zoe. 
ZOE I'm confused. I thought you made cheese or something. 
STAN What makes you think I don't? 
ZOE I don't know, you're over there playing the banjo. 
STAN Can't someone do both? 
ZOE Honestly, I didn't know anyone did either. 
BOBBY He says to name any restaurant you want to go to. (MORE) 
BOBBY (CONT'D) He'll be there with bells on. (then) He didn't say the "bells on" part. I added that. Sounds a little too gay, though, so I take it back. 
EXT. 8TH STREET - NIGHT 
Zoe walks down 8th street. This is the first time we've seen her really pulled together, and she looks hot. She turns into the restaurant she's chosen for the big date. 
INT. GRAY'S PAPAYA HOT DOGS - NIGHT 
Zoe and Stan stand at the counter with an array of hot dogs in front of them. Stan looks at the hot dogs skeptically. 
STAN We could have gone anywhere. 
ZOE Just take a bite.   You'll see. 
STAN Per Se, Jean Georges, Nobu... 
ZOE Gray's Papaya.   Cheers. 
She clinks his dog and then they each take a bite. 
ZOE (CONT'D) Good, right? 
Stan nods, covering his mouth because the bite is so big. 
ZOE (CONT'D) You've lived here your whole life and never been to Gray's Papaya. What's wrong with you? 
STAN I actually haven't lived here my whole life. We moved out of the city when my parents bought the farm....not died, but actually bought a farm and moved upstate. 
ZOE That must have been a nice place to grow up. On a farm. 
STAN What about your family? 
ZOE It's just me and my grandmother. She lives in a retirement community in Queens. (an awkward beat) My parents died when I was young. 
STAN I'm so sorry. 
There is a long silence.   They both stare at the hot dogs. 
STAN (CONT'D) I don't know what to say now.    I've made it all awkward and sad. 
ZOE It's okay. (then) My dad was kind of a bad guy, anyway. 
STAN Shit.   I'm so sorry, Zoe. 
ZOE No, come on, we'll get all this stuff out of the way so we never have to talk about it again. Let's ask all the awkward, get-to-know- you questions right now. 
STAN Okay.   Good idea. 
ZOE Let's see...are you religious? 
STAN Nope.   What about you? 
ZOE No. 
STAN Have you ever been married? 
ZOE No. 
STAN Aren't you sick of going to weddings? 
ZOE If I have to listen to one more couple write their own vows... 
STAN I hate when they write their own vows! 
They clasp hands. Not in a high-fivey way, but in a connected, we have so much in common way. Their hands stay together, feeling the charge between them. 
STAN (CONT'D) What about kids? 
Zoe feels the blood rush to her cheeks.   Like everyone there must now be looking at her. 
ZOE What about them? 
STAN Well, do you want them? 
ZOE Yeah.   I want kids. 
She pulls her hand away. This has all gotten suddenly real. She looks at Stan, almost afraid to ask the next question. 
ZOE (CONT'D) Do you? 
STAN Yeah.   Absolutely. 
Zoe nods.   Slowly, she starts to breathe again. 
ZOE (CONT'D) Come on, come on, come on... 
We hear the doorbell RING. 
ZOE (CONT'D) Shit. 
Zoe looks down at the test. Still nothing.      We wait and watch the test. The doorbell RINGS again. 
ZOE (CONT'D) Shit! 
A faint PLUS SIGN is forming. 
ZOE (CONT'D) Shitshitshitshit... 
The plus sign then turns BRIGHT PINK. Zoe's heart stops. There it is. Plain as day. Pregnant. 
ZOE (CONT'D) No, shit. 
Zoe stands.   Looks at herself in the mirror.   And then... 
ZOE (CONT'D) Holy fucking shit! 
INT. TAXI - NIGHT 
Manhattan fades into the distance, as they drive over the Brooklyn Bridge. Zoe cracks the window. 
STAN Are you feeling okay? 
Zoe nods.   Her face looks pale. 
STAN (CONT'D) Good, because this should really be a culinary adventure. This is an underground restaurant that moves from apartment to apartment, depending on the chef. 
Zoe nods again. Hasn't heard a word he's said. She rolls the window all the way down and hangs her head out. 
STAN (CONT'D) And some of the guys from the band will be there. So, we might get a little jam going. Sounds fun, right? (then) Zoe? 
Zoe's POV. Headlights from passing cars whiz by, and the wind swirls her hair into her face. Brooklyn approaches like a bad dream. 
INT. UNDERGROUND RESTAURANT/SMALL APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Stan walks down a long table filled with appetizers. He is making a plate for each of them. Zoe trails behind, beads of sweat on her forehead. 
STAN And this looks like a mache salad with grapes and feta. 
He takes some for each of them. 
STAN (CONT'D) And this, oh this must be white beans and lamb's tongue. You've got to have some of this. Etienne is famous for his lamb's tongue. 
Olivia approaches. 
OLIVIA Hey, stranger. 
STAN Oh, hey, Olivia.   You remember Zoe. 
OLIVIA Right. How'd that blueberry pie turn out? 
ZOE What? 
OLIVIA You bought blueberries from me? Said you were going to make a pie? 
ZOE Um, can you excuse me for a second? 
Zoe hurries off.   Olivia watches her go.   Eyes narrowing. 
OLIVIA No way she knows how to bake a pie. 
INT. UNDERGROUND RESTAURANT/SMALL APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER 
Zoe hovers by the window, whispering into the phone. 
ZOE I'm pregnant. 
BOBBY (O.S.) What?!   Where are you? I'm on my way. 
ZOE Brooklyn. 
BOBBY (O.S.) Where's that? 
Zoe hangs up the phone. 
INT. UNDERGROUND RESTAURANT/SMALL APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER 
Zoe is now on the phone with Mona. 
MONA (O.S.) Don't panic. Could be a false positive. Take another test. 
Zoe's head is in the toilet. Just when we think she's done, she pukes again. Finally, she lifts her head. 
ZOE Ohhhhhhhh. 
She spies an unused pregnancy test on the floor.  One that must have dropped. Maybe this will be the one with the answer she's looking for. She sits back on the toilet, mustering up all of her focus to pee again. She closes her eyes. 
ZOE (CONT'D) Please, God... 
But she can't pee.   She tries and tries. 
ZOE (CONT'D) Water, water everywhere, but not a drop to... 
She doubles over and pukes between her knees.   When she's done, she holds up the test. 
CU of the stick, which has no pee on it but is covered in vomit. Slowly the test reveals a PLUS SIGN. 
ZOE (CONT'D) Fuck me. 
EXT. PERRY STREET - NIGHT 
Stan and Zoe walk towards Zoe's brownstone. Stan is practically holding her up. Zoe stumbles along. 
STAN My singing made you vomit. 
ZOE No.    It's not that. 
STAN Sure, we were a little out of tune, but... 
ZOE I really don't feel well. 
STAN Is it your corns?    Hurts to walk? 
ANGLE on Carol, from Single Mother's By Choice, approaching. Zoe's face pales. 
CAROL Zoe? 
ZOE Wow.   Hi.    Hey, there... 
CAROL Where have you been?    You haven't been coming to any-- 
ZOE (cutting her off) Right. I know. I've been so busy. Next one, I'm there. For sure. (then, awkward) This is my friend, Stan. 
STAN Hi. 
CAROL (eyeing Stan suspiciously) Hello. Are you two-- 
ZOE Late. Yes. We are. We really are. (pushing Stan along) I'll see you at the meeting. Bye. 
They walk on.   Stan looks at Zoe. 
STAN An old...boyfriend? 
ZOE Her name is Carol. We're on a...committee together. 
They reach Zoe's front stoop.   Zoe peers over Stan's shoulder to make sure Carol's gone. 
ZOE (CONT'D) All right. I have to go to bed now. I'll call you, okay? 
STAN Okay. (then) Hey, I was thinking, if you don't have any plans this weekend, maybe you'd like to come up to the farm and get away for a few days. 
ZOE I'll call you tomorrow. Something's not agreeing with me. 
STAN Was it the lamb's tongue? 
Zoe runs inside holding her hand over her mouth.   Stan stands there for a beat. He calls after her. 
STAN (CONT'D) Okay, well...this weekend.   Think about it. 
INT. ZOE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Zoe lies in bed. Nuts sleeps beside her. Zoe stares out the window at a flickering street lamp, her face full of fear. 
ZOE What the hell have I done? 
EXT. SHADYBROOK RETIREMENT COMMUNITY - DAY 
Establishing shot of a retirement compound in Queens. 
INT. SHADYBROOK LOBBY - DAY 
The lobby is well-appointed and cheery. A young STAFF works behind a front desk area. Were it not for a scattering of PEOPLE IN WHEELCHAIRS, you might think we were at a Ramada. 
Zoe walks by the front desk.   ANNIE, an employee, looks up. 
ANNIE Hi, Zoe.   You look fantastic. 
NANA What about a secretary? 
ZOE Some kid named Fred. (then) I like him, Nana. 
NANA Well, if he's the right one, he'll stay. 
ZOE Do you really think so? 
NANA Gosh, I don't know. I hoped that would be enough to appease you. 
ZOE Should I still visit him for the weekend? Or should I just vanish and hope he forgets I ever existed. 
NANA Don't be silly. Go up there for the weekend. Spend some time with him and see what he's really like. 
ZOE Yeah.   You're right. 
NANA You might find out he's a total douchebag and then the whole thing is moot. 
Zoe looks at Nana.   Douchebag? 
INT. CAR - DAY 
Zoe is in the car. We are CLOSE on her as she talks rapidly and a bit maniacally. 
ZOE Okay, so we'll just hope that he's a douchebag. Could happen, right? 
WIDEN to reveal Nuts in the passenger seat.      He's yawning. 
ZOE (CONT'D) I'm sorry.     Am I keeping you up? 
Nuts closes his eyes and lays down. 
ZOE (CONT'D) My whole life is falling apart and you can't keep your bug-eyes open? (yawning) Thanks. Now I'm yawning. But why am I so tired? I slept nine hours. (thinks, then) And I'm starving, too. What the hell is going on? 
Zoe sees a gas station and jams on the breaks. 
INT. GAS STATION MINI MART - DAY 
Zoe pours a massive cup of coffee. One of those gas station Big Gulp cups. Even the TRUCKER next to her chooses a smaller cup. Then, a look crosses her face. 
ZOE Am I even allowed to drink coffee? 
The trucker looks at her.    She looks at him. 
ZOE (CONT'D) Do you know anything about being pregnant? 
EXT. CAR - LATER 
Zoe's car is now parked on the side of a highway in the middle of nowhere. 
INT. CAR - SAME 
Zoe is sound asleep with her head back and her mouth open. A small, empty coffee cup in her hand, crumpled candy bar wrappers on the floor, and an almost empty bag of Cheetos is in her lap. 
Her cell phone RINGS. Zoe doesn't move. After the third ring, she lifts her head and looks around. It takes her a few moments to realize what's happened. She looks at the little coffee cup. 
ZOE Thanks a lot, decaf. 
She picks up the phone. 
STAN (O.S.) Where are you? 
Zoe looks around. 
ZOE I have no idea. 
EXT. LITTLE GOAT FARM - DAY 
Zoe bumps along the winding driveway of this idyllic Hudson River farm. There are red barns in the distance and green pastures filled with goats and sheep. The house is an old carriage house with a rusty weather-vane on top. 
Zoe parks the car and takes in the whole scene. Stan opens the front door, with a huge smile on his face. Zoe sighs. 
ZOE He's so not a douchebag. 
INT. HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER 
They enter the front door.    Zoe takes in the charming carriage house. 
ZOE I can't believe you live here. This is ridiculous. 
STAN I just come on weekends. My parents really live here. 
ZOE Oh.   Where are they now? 
STAN In the kitchen. 
She quickly takes two slices of bread and goes back in. This time, she uses one piece of bread as a ladle and then the other to turn it into a sandwich. She takes a huge bite. 
ZOE (CONT'D) Oh.   My.    God. 
Stew dribbles down her chin. She takes a third piece of bread to wipe her face and then takes a bite of that one. 
Nuts starts to whine and beg. Zoe uses her bread-ladle to toss some stew on the floor for him. It lands with plop. 
And now Joan enters. Zoe and Nuts turn, their mouths bursting. Joan doesn't quite know what to do. All she knows is she's supposed to be open-minded. 
JOAN Would you like a plate? 
Zoe shakes her head no.     Wow.   This is embarrassing. 
JOAN (CONT'D) A napkin? 
Zoe nods her head. Joan gives her one. Zoe holds it over her mouth as she tries in vain to swallow this inhuman bite. 
JOAN (CONT'D) I'm Joan. 
Zoe nods.   Still can't swallow the bite. 
JOAN (CONT'D) And you must be Zoe. 
Zoe nods again. She tries to shake Joan's hand. It's the best she can do. Unfortunately, her fingers are fluorescent orange from the Cheetos powder. Joan pulls her hand back. 
INT. DINING ROOM - LATER 
The dining room is warm and lovely. There's faded wallpaper and an old stagecoach lamp serving as a chandelier. Despite the inviting room, Zoe looks very uncomfortable. 
EDWARD The stew is delicious, honey. 
STAN Yeah, Mom, it's awesome. 
EDWARD (to Zoe) Have you ever in your life had stew like this? Come on, be honest. 
Zoe looks at Joan.      Joan smiles.    It will be their secret. 
ZOE Uh...no.    Never. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER 
They are having coffee and dessert in the living room. Things seem more comfortable now. Zoe actually looks like she might be enjoying herself. Nuts sits beside her. 
JOAN So are all the animals in your pet store...differently abled? 
ZOE Oh, you can say paralyzed. He doesn't mind. (then) No, our pets are all in great shape. Purebreads mostly, but not from puppy mills. 
JOAN Those puppy mills are terrible.    I read about them in the paper. 
ZOE Well, that's actually how I ended up with Nuts. I bought him from this pet store near my house. Six months later, I had thousands of dollars in vet bills and had to put him in a wheelchair. 
EDWARD You should have sued that place. 
ZOE I thought about it, but what was that really going to do? They were still going to sell inbred dogs. So...I took the money I made when I left Google and just bought the place figuring I would do better. 
STAN You worked for Google? 
Zoe nods. 
STAN (CONT'D) How could I not know that? 
ZOE You never asked. 
STAN And you made a lot of money and then bought a pet store? 
Stan puts his arm around her and gives her a squeeze. 
STAN (CONT'D) I love that. 
ZOE It's been fun. Beats brand management, that's for sure. 
JOAN (to Edward) That sounds like us, honey. 
EDWARD It's true. (to Zoe) When we bought this farm we just wanted to make cheese because we couldn't find anything we liked in the stores. And now, twenty years later, here we are... 
JOAN Sometimes in life you just have to take matters into your own hands. Make things happen your own way, you know? 
Zoe forces a smile.   If only they knew. 
EXT. LITTLE GOAT FARM - NIGHT 
The moon is full and fireflies dot the air as Zoe and Stan walk the grounds of the farm. 
Nuts trots/rolls ahead of them in a different wheelchair. This one is more rugged, with mountain-bike-type wheels. 
INT. STAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Stan throws Zoe on the bed and then peels off his shirt. His body looks amazing in the shadowy moonlight. Zoe lies there, looking at him before he jumps on top of her. 
ZOE (under her breath) You're such a douchebag. 
STAN What? 
Zoe shakes her head and then melts into him. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. STAN'S ROOM - LATER 
They are now on their backs staring at the ceiling.    They look happy and worn out 
Their P.O.V. Those little glow-in-the-dark star stickers are all over the ceiling. There's barely any glow left. 
Stan lets out a big sigh as he looks at the "stars"... 
STAN That was amazing. I mean, like, totally and exceptionally, over-the- top, amazing. 
Zoe turns to him.   Takes a deep breath. 
ZOE Stan. 
STAN Yeah. 
ZOE There's something I really have to tell you. 
STAN There's something I have to tell you, too. 
Now Stan turns to her.     They are face-to-face. 
STAN (CONT'D) Can I go first? `Cause if we're going to say the same thing, I want to say it first. 
ZOE We're not going to say the same thing. 
STAN Well, let me go, because this is really embarrassing, and I just have to say it. 
ZOE Okay. 
STAN I've dated a lot of women. I mean, not tons, but a lot. And, the thing is, I've never...been in love before. I've never even told anyone I love them before. Because I just never felt it. But from the day we met, from the first time our backs accidentally touched in the subway, I feel this, this... (he shakes his head) Maybe this is too much to say right now, but...I love you, Zoe. I really do. 
Stan finishes.    He looks at her and smiles.   Zoe just stares at him. 
STAN (CONT'D) In my mind, you were supposed to say, I love you, too. 
Instead, Zoe covers her mouth and runs to the bathroom.     A beat later, we hear her vomit. 
INT. STAN'S BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Zoe is at the sink, furiously brushing her teeth.    Stan enters. 
STAN Zoe? 
He looks at her.   Sees the tears in her eyes. 
STAN (CONT'D) Why are you crying? Everything's perfect. 
ZOE It's not. 
STAN Sure it is. 
Zoe takes a deep breath. 
STAN (CONT'D) What? 
ZOE I'm pregnant. 
STAN Uh, I'm pretty sure it doesn't happen that fast. 
Zoe shakes her head. 
ZOE I just found out. 
STAN Pregnant? As in you're going to have a baby? 
Zoe nods. 
STAN (CONT'D) I don't understand. 
ZOE I know.   It's hard to explain. 
STAN Well, who's it? 
JOAN (CONT'D) And pretty and... 
Another HURL.    Joan looks at Stan. 
JOAN (CONT'D) What the hell's going on in there? 
STAN She's pregnant. 
JOAN Oh, dear God. 
We hear the toilet FLUSH. 
INT. CAR - DAY 
Zoe sits in the passenger seat with the key in the ignition. Stan leans against the car. They are both quiet. 
ZOE I don't know what to say. 
Neither does Stan, who says nothing.    He runs his foot back and forth in the gravel. 
ZOE (CONT'D) I guess I'd given up on meeting someone like you, and I did what I thought was best. 
Stan still doesn't say anything. 
ZOE (CONT'D) But, for what it's worth...I love you, too. 
She puts the car in gear and pulls out.    Stan watches her go. His hands in his pockets. 
EXT. MONA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Zoe stands in the hallway of Mona's apartment building.   A beat later, Mona opens the door and holds out her arms. 
MONA Come here. 
Zoe walks slowly into her embrace. They stand like this for a long time. Just holding each other. Until Mona's three kids run out with wiffle-ball bats and chase each other down the hall. A beat later, the toddler runs after them crying. 
INT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Zoe lies in bed with Nuts. She opens her eyes and stares at the ceiling. Then, with a sigh, she gets up and does her morning ritual. 
She pulls up her nightgown and sticks out her stomach.    For the first time, we actually see a little bump. 
INT. EXAM ROOM - DAY 
Zoe lies on the table with a paper gown over her lap. She looks down at her feet in the stirrups. Sadly, we notice a perfect pedicure. 
Dr. Harris comes in with a big smile. 
DR. HARRIS Congratulations! What luck to get pregnant on the first try, huh? And with frozen sperm, too. So, how are we feeling? 
ZOE (unconvincing) Okay. 
DR. HARRIS You sure about that? 
ZOE It's been hard. I don't know if I was really prepared for this. 
DR. HARRIS Well, your hormones aren't helping, and going through this without a partner must be difficult. 
Dr. Harries readies the ultrasound wand and inserts the device. He turns the monitor so that Zoe can see. 
DR. HARRIS (CONT'D) Well, the good news is everything looks great. You are now eight weeks pregnant, which is an important milestone. With a little luck, we should be able to see a heartbeat today. 
On the screen we see a small flickering dot.    Dr. Harris smiles. 
ZOE That's it?     That's...my baby? 
Saying these words out loud for the first time hits Zoe. Tears fill her eyes. 
ZOE (CONT'D) Hi, Baby. (then) Is it okay? Is it healthy? 
DR. HARRIS Everything's just... (makes a face, then) Wait, a minute... 
ZOE What?   Wait a minute, what? 
DR. HARRIS Well...I see another heartbeat. 
ZOE (freaking out) It has two hearts? 
DR. HARRIS No...but you have two babies. 
Zoe's mouth falls open. 
NT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - DAY 
We're back at Single Women By Choice. The women are sitting on the floor. Sara is still nursing Dakota. Zoe has her head in her hands. 
STAN This is insane. 
INT. ZOE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
It's late. Zoe and Stan are naked in bed, lying face to face. Stan puts his hand on her stomach. He feels the little bump, new since he's last been with her. 
STAN Do you feel any kicking? 
ZOE Sometimes. 
STAN What does it feel like? 
ZOE Like butterflies. 
Stan smiles. He likes this image. He runs his hand over her belly. Zoe moves in closer. Touches his cheek. 
ZOE (CONT'D) Are you really sure you want to do this? 
STAN Yeah.     I'm really sure. 
They look at each other for a long time. Finally, Zoe closes her eyes and settles in for sleep, with Stan watching her as she dozes off. 
INT. EXAM - ROOM 
CU of a MONITOR where we see two distinct baby shapes floating head-to-toe. 
Dr. Harris holds the ultrasound wand to her belly. Stan doesn't say anything. He looks on in total amazement. 
ZOE Are you okay? 
STAN They're so...perfect.      They look like real babies. 
DR. HARRIS Would you like to know the sexes? 
They look at each other.      Zoe smiles.   Stan shrugs.   Zoe nods. Stan does, too. 
ZOE Yes.     Tell us. 
DR. HARRIS You're having two healthy little girls. 
Stan gets tears in his eyes. 
STAN Two girls? 
ZOE Two girls. 
DR. HARRIS Congratulations. 
EXT. MADISON AVENUE - DAY 
Stan and Zoe walk down Madison Avenue. All of the other NEW YORKERS are on some kind of mission -- shopping, rushing to meetings, or fighting for cabs. 
But Zoe and Stan just walk slowly hand-in-hand. Every so often looking at each other and just smiling or laughing. Then, suddenly, Stan picks her up in the middle of the street. 
STAN Two girls! 
A WOMAN with a BABY in a Baby Bjorn passes by.   Stan smiles. Now he's part of this exclusive club. 
STAN (CONT'D) Hi. 
WOMAN Hi. 
INT. UNION SQUARE CAFE - NIGHT 
We PAN past several small plates of food on a table.   A chef tells us what delectable items we are looking at. 
CHEF Here we have a yellowtail sashimi with ponzu sauce and pea shoots. This is carpaccio with shaved white truffles. And, finally, an heirloom tomato salad with fresh Buratta flown in from Italy this morning. 
STAN Thanks, Sam. It looks incredible. 
Sam tops off their champagne and exits.   Stan picks up his fork and starts eating. Zoe does not. 
STAN (CONT'D) Aren't you hungry? 
ZOE I can't eat any of this. 
STAN Why not? 
ZOE (pointing to each dish) Raw. Raw. Unpasteurized. (re: champagne) Alcohol. 
STAN Let me get Sam back. He'll make you anything you want. 
ZOE I don't want to hurt his feelings. You go ahead. I'm fine. 
STAN Well, what are you going to eat? 
Stan goes to the closet. Zoe is pulling on a long black dress. She tries to smush her boobs down into the top. 
STAN (CONT'D) That's perfect. You look hot. 
ZOE Really?    You think? 
Zoe turns to reveal the back.     The two sides of the zipper are ten inches apart. 
STAN Do you have a shawl or something? 
Zoe bursts into tears. 
EXT. PERRY STREET - LATER 
A cab pulls up in front of Zoe's brownstone. Stan opens the door for Zoe who is now wearing a long silver dress. While it's certainly hugging every curve and bump, it looks great. 
STAN You look smokin'. 
ZOE Thanks, honey. 
Zoe pauses in front of the open taxi door. 
STAN Let's go.     We're super late. 
She tries to bend at the waist, but the dress is too tight. Then she tries to go in butt first and swing her legs around, but again, the dress is too tight. 
ZOE Hmmmm... 
STAN Why don't you sort of go in...head first and then turn around. 
Zoe leans her head in and then has no other choice but to lie down sideways on the seat. Stan tries not to laugh. 
ZOE Shut up and push me. 
STAN Push you? 
ZOE Just do it. 
Stan pushes her legs, and Zoe disappears inside the cab. 
INT. TAXI - CONTINUOUS 
Zoe lies down straight across the seats like a board. 
ZOE I hate everyone. 
She sucks in her breath and tries to sit up. As soon as she bends at the waist, we hear a horrific RIP. She bursts into tears again. 
INT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - LATER 
We PAN over the coffee table. There's a pint of melty Ben and Jerry's, a roll of cookie dough (half eaten,) US Weekly, and The National Enquirer. 
Zoe and Bobby lie on the floor looking at the ceiling. 
ZOE Do you think he's telling everyone why I didn't go? I'm too much of a fat-ass walrus to go to the wedding? 
BOBBY You're not a fat ass walrus. You're pregnant. 
Zoe eyes well up with tears again. 
BOBBY (CONT'D) Why are you crying? So what?   You missed a stupid wedding. (MORE) 
BOBBY (CONT'D) You got to have girls' night with me. This is way more fun. 
ZOE I don't know. I'm just so emotional lately. It's the hormones. 
BOBBY You can't help it. Being pregnant sucks. You're emotional, and irrational, and you get back fat. 
ZOE I have back fat? 
BOBBY No.  I'm just kidding. (then) Okay, yes. You have back fat. 
Zoe feels her back. 
ZOE How's Stan going to stay with me through this? I'm disgusting. 
BOBBY We'll go shopping tomorrow. We'll get some hip maternity clothes... whatever that means. 
ZOE Look at me, Bobby. 
BOBBY What? 
ZOE (pinching back fat) Look at me. What do you see? 
BOBBY I see the most amazingly wonderful person I know. 
STAN It's a nice ass. 
ZOE You said you don't know the real me, so I thought I'd show you. 
She picks up another photograph. This one is of Zoe at twelve and at her most awkward -- short hair, braces and acne. 
ZOE (CONT'D) This is me in seventh grade. 
Stan props himself up in one elbow. 
STAN Wow. 
ZOE I know. 
STAN You look like Anthony Michael Hall. 
ZOE This period, as horrible as it was, made me who I am. I think every person should go through a hideously ugly phase. It builds character. (then) It also taught me that I should never, under any circumstances, have short hair and a perm again. 
She picks up another picture. It's Zoe in a bathing cap and Speedo. She's holding up a yellow ribbon and has her arm around Nana. 
ZOE (CONT'D) This   is one of my favorites because look   how happy I am. I don't even know   what place yellow is, but I'm sure   it's not good. 
STAN Fifth place. 
ZOE But I still look super happy, right? That's all because of Nana. Whatever I did, she thought it was the best. 
The next picture is a Halloween shot of Bobby, Mona and Zoe. Bobby is all in green, Zoe is all in yellow and Mona is in regular clothes. 
ZOE (CONT'D) These are my best friends, Bobby and Mona. Mona and I met in high school and Bobby passed out on my couch in college and never left. You haven't met them yet because they might scare you away. 
STAN Why are you dressed like that? 
ZOE Halloween. We were supposed to be a traffic light but Mona bagged out at the last minute and so Bobby and I just look like idiots. That's typical Mona, by the way. 
Zoe puts the picture down and picks up another. It's a woman in a hospital bed. She's giving the thumbs up sign. 
ZOE (CONT'D) This is my mom. 
Stan takes the picture and studies it. 
STAN You look just like her. 
ZOE This is the last picture of her that I have. She lived for a few more years, but we never took any pictures because she didn't want us to remember her like that. I was eight when she died. 
STAN I...can't imagine. 
ZOE She had a great laugh. And really soft hands. She used to rub my back before I went to sleep. 
Zoe puts the picture on the bedside table, propping it up next to her clock. 
STAN Do you have any pictures of your dad? 
Zoe doesn't say anything. 
STAN (CONT'D) I'm sorry. If you don't want to talk about it... 
ZOE My mother was in a coma for two years before the end. That's when my dad left her. 
STAN Oh. 
ZOE So...that's when he died.    To us, anyway. 
STAN God, Zoe.    I'm so sorry. 
ZOE (after a beat) It's okay. It was an important lesson. That's when I realized that nothing lasts forever. 
This sad statement hangs in the air for a few moments. 
ZOE (CONT'D) So, that's my story. That's the real me. 
STAN Things can last forever, you know. 
ZOE Not for me they can't. 
Stan takes her hand, and they stay like that for a while. Just holding hands on the floor of her moonlit room. Finally, the silence is broken by the telephone RINGING. 
ZOE (CONT'D) That's weird. 
INT. LORI'S APARTMENT BUILDING LOBBY - NIGHT 
Zoe and Stan enter the lobby of an old building in Tribeca. 
STAN I'm confused. Why did you say you would come witness this birth in the first place? 
ZOE I don't know. Seemed like a good idea at the time. I was trying to get back in their good graces. Go home. I'll meet you there. I don't want them to see you anyway. 
Carol starts banging the drum again and moves off. 
STAN What's a water birth? 
ZOE I don't know. But just so we're clear, this... (re. the whole scene) Is not the real me. 
STAN I'll wait here. 
Zoe grabs another brownie and exits. 
INT. LORI'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
In the middle of this very small, very cramped living room is an inflatable baby pool. And in this baby pool is Lori, who is now naked and pushing. 
Zoe watches, horrified, the brownie still in her hand.    Carol is beside her, playing the drum and chanting. 
CAROL Hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-hi-ya-ya. 
ZOE (eyes wide) Wow. Wow. Wow. 
CAROL I know. It's amazing how the body can open up like that. 
Zoe covers her mouth. It looks like she is going to throw up. She stumbles for the door. 
ZOE I'm just going to get some air. I'm feeling a little... 
LORI Don't move, Zoe, you're my focal point. 
Lori then GRUNTS through another big contraction. 
MIDWIFE Push, Lori. Push. 
While Lori's eyes are closed, Zoe tries to sneak out.    Carol chases after, still beating the drum. 
CAROL You can't leave.   You're her focal point. 
ZOE Can't she use someone else? 
CAROL She's in labor. You want to argue with her now? 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. LORI'S LIVING ROOM - LATER 
Carol beats the drum faster now. Some of the other Single Mothers by Choicers join her in the chant. 
CAROL Hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-hi-ya-ya. 
Lori lets out a SCREAM as Tabitha and the MIDWIFE pull her legs back. Zoe watches with both hands over her mouth. 
ZOE Oh, Jesus. (then) What is...that? 
CAROL Sssshh. It's perfectly natural. Sometimes the bowels just let go. (then, back to chanting) Hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-hi-ya-ya. 
The midwife fishes out the poop with a plastic bag.   Zoe turns away, gagging. She drops her brownie. 
LORI (yelling) Don't move, Zoe, I need you! You're my focal point. 
ZOE What does that even mean? 
Zoe turns back.   Her face white as a sheet.   Lori lets out another WAIL. 
LORI I need to turn over.    Please! 
JESSIE Do it, Lori. We're here for you. We're all here for you. 
Carol beats the drum faster as Lori gets on all fours. The midwife lifts Lori's leg up to the side.   Lori lets out a loud, WHALE-LIKE MOAN. 
CAROL (excited) Here comes the head. 
Lori's moan turns into a DONKEY-LIKE BRAY. 
JESSIE We can see the head, Lori. 
CAROL There's so much hair! 
ZOE (woozy, afraid) I don't think that's the baby's hair. 
LORI I want to see the head. Get me a mirror. It's in the bedroom. 
ZOE I'll get it. 
Zoe makes a desperate attempt to run from the room. 
LORI GOD DAMN IT ZOE, DON'T MOVE!!!! 
ANGLE ON Olivia crossing from her berry stand to the cheese stand with a blueberry pie. She is about to place the pie on Stan's table when she looks up and sees Stan and Zoe. 
OLIVIA Oh, hi. 
STAN Hi. (awkward beat, then) You remember Zoe. 
OLIVIA Right, hi. 
And then Olivia notices Zoe's pregnant belly. 
OLIVIA (CONT'D) Wow. (then, to Stan) Wow. 
At the same time, Zoe notices the post-it on the pie.   It says, SORRY ABOUT LAST NIGHT. 
ZOE What is that supposed to mean? 
OLIVIA It's nothing. 
Olivia crumples the post-it and turns to Stan. 
OLIVIA (CONT'D) (re. Zoe's pregnant belly) I had no idea it was that serious. 
STAN I told you it was serious. 
ZOE (interrupting) What the hell does, "sorry about last night" mean? 
OLIVIA It's stupid. I was drunk and... 
STAN It was nothing. 
ZOE What was nothing? 
Olivia turns back to Stan, flabbergasted. 
OLIVIA You're having a baby? I didn't know you'd been together that long. 
STAN Well, they're not mine...but, yeah, we're having a baby. Two actually. 
On Zoe's look of shock we... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. FARMER'S MARKET - MOMENTS LATER 
The fruits and vegetables and flowers become a blur as Zoe runs out of the Farmer's Market. Stan chases after her. 
STAN Nothing happened. 
ZOE Get away from me. 
Stan runs in front of her, forcing her to stop. 
STAN Nothing happened! 
ZOE You said, "they're not mine." 
STAN I didn't mean to say it. 
ZOE How could you say that? 
STAN I don't know. I was flustered. 
ZOE Flustered? 
STAN I'm sorry, I'm not exactly thinking straight. I've been up all night watching Orca give birth! 
ZOE (incredulous) "They're not mine?" 
STAN (at a loss ) Well, I mean...technically, they're not. 
The minute he says this, he wishes he could take it back. Zoe just looks at him. She shakes her head. 
ZOE You know, all this time you're trying to figure out who the real me is, but who the fuck are you? 
STAN Zoe. 
She runs to a nearby cab and slams the door. 
INT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Zoe enters the apartment and slams the door behind her. She runs to the couch and collapses in tears. Nuts wheels over and stands beside her. 
INT. LE PAIN QUOTIDIEN - DAY 
Zoe and Mona are at their usual table.    Zoe looks like she hasn't slept. 
As soon as the contraction ends... 
ZOE Fuck off. 
Zoe takes off again.    Olivia watches her go. 
EXT. FARMER'S MARKET - LATER 
Zoe runs through the market looking for Stan. 
ANGLE ON Stan's truck, where Stan and Fred are unloading cheese. 
ZOE Stan! 
Fred turns around and sees Zoe running. All belly and boobs bouncing towards him. Her gown starting falling off. 
FRED Whoa. I've had nightmares that started like this. 
ZOE Stan! 
Stan turns. 
STAN Zoe? 
ZOE Stan! 
STAN Are you okay? Don't run! 
ZOE I can't help it! 
She keeps running towards him. He now runs towards her. They finally meet. Zoe is out of breath and can barely talk. 
STAN Are you all right? 
ZOE (panting) Great. I'm great. 
STAN Why are you in a hospital gown? 
ZOE I'm in labor. 
STAN What?   What the hell are you doing here? 
ZOE It's you. 
STAN What? 
ZOE Nana's my birthing partner, but she passed out and needed stitches, and Bobby asked me who I most wanted with me, and...it's you. It's only you. (then) I don't want to be alone anymore. I love you. You don't know how much I love you. 
Stan doesn't know what to say.   He's literally speechless. 
ZOE (CONT'D) More than anything in the world, I love you. 
STAN I've been in love with you since the moment you stole my cab. 
Zoe bends over, holding her stomach.   A contraction. 
ZOE Hee-hee, hoo-hoo, it was my cab, hee-hee, hoo-hoo. 
The contraction ends. Zoe can finally smile again.      Stan laughs and throws his arms around her. 
ZOE (CONT'D) Ow.   Ow.   Ow. 
STAN I'm sorry. Oh, I'm sorry. I just love you. I love you so much. (then) Let's get the hell out of here. 
ZOE Yeah. I think I really need to go to the hospital now. 
They kiss again. And then pull apart and look at each other. Stan has tears in his eyes. 
STAN Let's go have our babies. 
People clap and cheer as they hurry out of the Farmer's Market. Even Olivia, watching from a distance, can't help but applaud the big moment. 
INT. OPERATING ROOM - DAY 
Some fantastic song that makes us want to cry is playing... 
We are CLOSE on Zoe's face. She is smiling.    She does not look scared. And she does not look alone. 
WIDEN to reveal Stan by her side. 
And we PULL BACK and above the operating table and see Dr. Harris performing the C-section. He pulls out the babies one by one. 
We FOLLOW the babies as they get swaddled tight and handed back to Zoe and Stan. 
Zoe and Stan look at the little girls and then at each other. They are both in tears. Even Dr. Harris can't help but cry.

November 2006 
TNT. KITCHEN - DAY A New York Times crossword puzzle. The hand of MARY HOROWITZ scratches the answers in ink without pausing even a second between each one. 
MARY (V.O.) Vita aenigma est. Life is a puzzle. It is. Specifically, life is most like a crossword puzzle. There are a million reasons why, not the least of which is that life, like crosswords, requires the use of your whole entire brain- Her writing hand knocks a glass of grape soda and it spills all over the puzzle. 
MARY Crap. The puzzle answers all run together. 
INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY 
Ten plastic folding chairs line the hallway -- all empty except for one. In the last chair sits Mary Horowitz, 31, in her best synthetic cardigan, somebody's grandmother's skirt, her own red rubber boots. Genius meets retard. She mumbles to herself. 
MARY Four letter word for... vomit. She takes a deep breath to calm her nerves. it doesn't help. 
MARY Not "barf". For sure not "barf". That's too easy. "Puke" is okay, but maybe a bit pedestrian (that means boring)... I like "hurl". I do. I like the way it rolls off your tongue -- the word, I mean. But my all time favorite is none of those. She puts her head between her knees, tries to keep it together. 
MARY Four letter word for vomit? S-P-E- W. Spew... Sp-ew. A door nearby opens but Mary doesn't budge. A POLICE OFFICER walks out. A 40ish female TEACHER pokes her head out the door, signals to Mary. 
TEACHER We're ready for you now. (a plastic Kroger shopping Mary jumps up, grabs her purse bag). 
MARY Jesus help me. 
INT. CLASSROOM - DAY 
Mary stands in front of the chalkboard, "CAREER DAY" written in huge letters behind her. She smiles with terror at the class of 10 year old KIDS. The Teacher reads from her notes. 
TEACHER Here's a treat, students. Our final guest for Career Day, Miss Mary Horowitz, is the crossword constructor for the Atlanta Citizen. You know the crossword puzzles you see every week in the newspaper? It's her job to create them. Isn't that fun? Mary stares at the Teacher, whispers. 
MARY You weren't supposed to tell them. 
TEACHER Pardon me? 
MARY I made a crossword puzzle to help them guess what my job is. You ruined it. 
TEACHER Oh, I'm so sorry. 
Mary takes the crossword puzzles out of her bag, looks at them like lost puppies. 
TEACHER Maybe you could tell them a bit about what your job is like? watche s hit 
GARBAGE Mary drops thu p file out her the bottom She p lls u hearsed enthusiasm. bag, reads with re 
MARY People do crossword puzzles all the time but they don't often think of the person who made all the words fit together, and who thought up the clues, and who made sure the little black squares at the top mirror the ones at the bottom. She pulls one of the crosswords out of the garbage can, holds it up, turns it upside down, forces a nervous smile. 
MARY Crossword constructors usually have above average intelligence, with knowledge of just about every subject you can imagine. And it helps if they can spell. The card in Mary's hand reads "LAUGH". She laughs. Nobody else does. She looks at the cards again, instantly gets serious, sweeps her hand through the air. 
MARY Imagine, for a moment, a world without crossword puzzles. A world- Mary notices one Kid with his hand up. It totally throws her off. 
TEACHER Daniel, you have a question? 
DANIEL You make a living doing that? Just making puzzles? The Atlanta Citizen only comes out on Fridays. One puzzle a week can't make you enough to live on. A LARGE KID in the front row pipes up. 
LARGE KID How do you pay your rent? 
MARY My parents - 
BETTY Nine dollar twenty. Mary fishes in her bag for money. 
MARY We could bring your dad if you want. I don't think the show is ageist. That means he won't feel like a loser for being old. As she takes her time paying, Mr. Takihashi madly gestures about Mary holding up the line. Betty barks at her. 
BETTY Pecha kucha! Do Itta! Betty takes Mary's money, waves her on and helps the next customer. 
MARY So no then? That's a no? Betty ignores her. Mary waits, loads the newspapers into her bag. 
MARY (V.O.) Sometimes crosswords are even better than life. Here's how. They don't discriminate. Crosswords don't care if you're young or old; black or white; male, female or intersex. Crosswords only care if you're an idiot. And, really, that's okay, because if you have the IQ of a yam, finishing a crossword should be the least of your worries. Mary glances up at the TV news once more, then walks away. 
INT. CNN LOADING BAY - DAY 
A half dozen NEWS CREWS rush to load and unload CNN news ECHS -- vans. JOURNALISTS, PHOTOGRAPHERS, PRODUCERS, SOUNDyT all in a mad rush to go get An unshaven and surprisingly calm STEVE balances camera equipment in one hand while he scratches a barely legible "Steve" onto a clipboard. A young PA takes the clipboard, hands Steve a bunch of gas masks. 
50'S Steve heads to an open van where a disheveled, mid producer ANGUS MCCORMACK checks his watch. 
ANGUS Where the hell is he? 
STEVE Probably doing his nails. -- paper 40ish reporter HARTMAN HUGHES rushes to the van on his face. napkin tucked in his shirt collar, bread crumbs 
HARTMAN What do you mean "the big one"? Terrorists, natural disaster, what? 
ANGUS Pandemic. Hartman's eyes light up. 
ANGUS Half of the Midwest and spreading. Nobody's safe. Steve tries on a gas mask. 
HARTMAN Please let it be the bird flu. 
STEVE Bird flu is for pussies. This thing's unstoppable. 
HARTMAN How's it spreading? Angus looks at Steve. 
STEVE Squirrels. Hartman can barely contain his excitement. 
HARTMAN Oh my God, they're everywhere! 
STEVE Exactly. 
HARTMAN Al Qaeda connection? 
ANGUS Always a possibility. 
STEVE Who wishes he was in Iraq now? 
HARTMAN Not me!. Hartman grabs a gas mask and rushes to the van's side mirror. 
HARTMAN I need blush. No, wait. I'll go pasty. It'll look like I could be the first media victim. "Hartman Hughes, no such thing as too close to the story". Hartman looks back at Steve and Angus. They're just standing there, unable to keep a straight face. Hartman deflates. 
HARTMAN Assholes! I knew it was too good to be true. He throws his gas mask down, storms off. 
ANGUS Hartman, come on. Hartman gets in the elevator, hollers out to them. 
HARTMAN I had a perfectly good bologna sandwich going on upstairs. Wasted! Angus and Steve watch the elevator door close, shrug it off. 
STEVE Next E-coli story breaks, he'll be fine. 
EXT. HOROWITZ HOUSE - DAY 
An 1890 Colonial Revival home surrounded by White Oaks. Oversized statue of the Blessed Virgin in the flower bed. Mezuzah on the door. Face still in the newspaper, Mary trips up the steps and skids onto the porch. Her knee starts to bleed. 
MARY Crap. 
MARY Please don't mean on the inside. 
MRS. HOROWITZ Beautiful and smart. And fun. And interesting. Mary takes a deep breath, lets it out fast. 
MARY Let's hope all that does it for him. 
INT. HOROWITZ HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT 
A bored, CNN jacket wearing Steve looks up to see Mrs. Horowitz descending the stairs. Not far behind, Mary takes each step like her knees are fused together but still manages to look hot. Steve's pleasantly surprised. With one look at Steve, Mary's eyes glaze over as if a choir is screaming "hallelujah" in her brain. As Mary reaches the bottom step -- 
STEVE Mary, hi. I'm Steve. She puts up a finger - "just a second". She turns around and runs back upstairs. Steve looks at Mrs. Horowitz, confused. 
MRS. HOROWITZ And how's your mother? 
STEVE Great. Thanks. She just stares at him and smiles. 
INT. HOROWITZ HOUSE - MARY'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Mary runs into her room, kneels down in front of the mizrach and crucifix on the wall. Hands clasped in prayer. 
MARY Gods. You may have noticed that I'm wearing clean socks. Translation: I'm really trying and thus should be amply rewarded. Thanks for your support. She gets up, has a second thought, gets back onto her knees. 
MARY And by support I don't mean, you know - She hikes up her bra. 
MARY I mean your assistance, your furtherance, your advocacy of my efforts to get out there and... do what I'm supposed to do. She concentrates hard, opens her eyes. Now she's ready. 
INT. HOROWITZ HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Steve waits as Mary walks down the stairs again, this time a bit more relaxed. 
MRS. HOROWITZ There we go. Mary makes it to the bottom of the stairs, steps into her red boots. Her mother cringes. Steve's a bit surprised at the boots but who cares, Mary's still hot from the knee caps up. 
STEVE Ready? Mary nods a bunch of times. 
STEVE Mrs. Horowitz. Goodnight. (calling into living room) Sir. 
MR. HOROWITZ (O.S.) You kids have fun. 
MRS. HOROWITZ Be careful now. Don't forget your seatbelts. Mrs. Horowitz sees them out the door then heads into the living room. She waves to them out the window, trying to hide her worry but failing miserably. 
MR. HOROWITZ She'll be fine. They look at each other - a bit of hope, a bit of dread. 
EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
Steve unlocks the driver's side door of his SUV while Mary waits at her door, nervous but smiling. 
STEVE Sorry about this blind date thing. My mother - 
MARY I never went to kindergarten! He looks at her, totally confused. 
MARY They skipped me to the forth grade. 
STEVE Okay. She gets in the car, fastens her seatbelt. Steve hesitates then heads to the driver's side, gets in. 
MARY I missed finger painting. He has no clue what to say. 
STEVE Sorry? 
MARY Me too. She lunges for his lips but the seatbelt snaps her back inches short. 
STEVE Whoa! Undeterred by the whiplash, Mary undoes her seatbelt and tries again, this time making contact with Steve's lips. He's more than a little startled but kisses her back anyway, all the while straining to see the Horowitz house. 
Mary's parents hear the door open then Mary's footsteps hit the stairs. Mrs. Horowitz jumps up, rushes to meet her. 
MRS. HOROWITZ Sweetie, what's wrong? What happened? My God, you've barely been gone ten minutes. Mary stops on the stairs, turns back. 
MARY Mom, sometimes that's all you need to know he's the one! Mary smiles big, takes the rest of the stairs up two at a time. Mrs. Horowitz is about to follow her. 
MR. HOROWITZ That girl makes up her mind the moon is green, it's green. Leave her be. It'll pass. Eventually. Mrs. Horowitz moves away from the stairs, no less worried. 
INT. HOROWITZ HOUSE - MARY'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Mary leaps from the doorway and lands on her bed in pencil pose, smiling up at the ceiling. 
MARY Eleven letter word for serendipity. She screams into her pillow. 
MARY The perfect answer: S-E-R-E-N-D-I-P- I-T-Y. Serendipity. Why would you ever need a better word than that? She sits up, grabs her notebook, starts to draw out a new crossword puzzle. 
- DAY 
INT. ATLANTA CITIZEN NEWSPAPER OFFICES 
A busy newspaper office. COURIERS make deliveries, JOURNALISTS talk at their desks, SECRETARIES count the minutes until they can go home. In the Editor's office, JIM SOLOMAN looks over the newspaper layout with an ASSISTANT. 
SOLOMAN Let's split the gardening feature into two weeks. Keep them in suspense. He steps back, looks at the whole layout. 
SOLOMAN Looks good. How are we doing here? 
He checks his watch. 
SOLOMAN Five minutes to spare. Look at that. The Assistant points to a blank corner of page 26. Soloman's surprised, and not particularly impressed. 
SOLOMAN Horowitz. 
INT. ATLANTA CITIZEN BUILDING - ELEVATOR - DAY 
Mary stands at the front of the full elevator, smiling, a piece of paper gripped in her hand. 
MARY (V.0.) When I was a fledgling (that means novice) crossword constructor, I would find comfort in the words of the learned crossword sages. Above all, my hero is Manny Nosowsky, frequent New York Times contributor and all around cruciverbial master. 
INT. ATLANTA CITIZEN NEWSPAPER OFFICES - DAY 
Mary walks out of the elevator and heads through the office. Nobody seems to notice her. 
MARY (V.O.) Manny says that a crossword puzzle's greatness can be determined by asking three simple questions. She marches in the direction of the Editor's office. 
MARY (V.0.) Is it solvable? She almost collides with a mail cart but keeps walking. 
MARY (V.0.) Is it entertaining? She arrives at the Editor's office, plants her feet in the doorway. 
MARY (V.O.) Does it s arkle? She looks down at the crossword puzzle in her hands, smiles, holds it out for Soloman. Soloman grabs the crossword and hands it right to the Assistant, who rushes it out the door. 
INT. HAIR SALON - DAY 
Two OLD LADIES sit under the hair dryers, each doing the Atlanta Citizen crossword puzzle. They're stumped. The first Old Lady hollers over the noise of the dryer. 
OLD LADY 
I CAN'T GET ANY OF THESE! The other Old Lady holds up her blank crossword, shrugs. 
INT. TAXI - DAY 
The TAXI DRIVER sits in the parked taxi doing the crossword. 
MR. HOROWITZ And Steve? 
MARY He works a lot, you know. Travels all the time. 'Tis possible he has not yet espied it. She picks up the crossword, admires it. 
MARY But when he does, I'm sure he'll say, "that Mary Horowitz... is a catch. Where oh where has she been all my empty life? From here onward my life will be divided into 'before I met Mary' and 'after I met Mary' with the second part being far superior. I am lonely no more. The missing letter in my puzzle has at last been found." 
MR. HOROWITZ I don't want you getting your hopes up too much. 
MARY I'm not. 
INT. CNN ATLANTA - DAY 
An exec office. Steve relaxes on the sofa next to Angus while Hartman noses around the office. 
ANGUS We're going to hit rush. We'll have to take the second flight. Exec. Producer DAN CORBITT walks in, heads straight for his desk. 
CORBITT You're set. KDFW's on site now. Angus and Steve start to get up. 
CORBITT Hang on. They sit. Corbitt grabs the remote control, turns the TV on. 
CORBITT Anybody want to tell me about this? He fast forwards through footage of Hartman reporting from a greenhouse. Corbitt slows it to normal speed, mutes it. They watch as Hartman interviews an attractive female BOTANIST holding a test tube with a seedling in it. Hartman keeps pointing to the seedling - which happens to be right in front of the Botanist's generous breasts. The camera gets closer and closer - each time it pulls away Hartman points to the seedling again to force the camera in close - basically turning the piece into a giant boob-fest. 
ANGUS Take a look at those... plants. Corbitt pauses it on the worst shot, looks at Steve. 
CORBITT We can't use this. Hartman fakes disgust. 
HARTMAN Of course not. Nice camera work, Stevie. Steve glares at Hartman. Corbitt points at the frozen shot on the TV screen, looks at Steve. 
CORBITT You want to go back to the Weather Channel, try that again. Corbitt checks his watch, points them out the door. 
CORBITT Get out of here. Don't embarrass me in Dallas. Hartman, Angus and Steve walk out. Steve nods to Hartman - thanks asshole. In the hallway, Steve's cell phone rings. He answers it. 
STEVE What?... Mom, let me call you back. 
He listens, signals to Angus he needs a minute, then stops at a reception area. He sorts through the newspapers, pulls out the Atlanta Citizen, flips through it. 
STEVE What page? He finds Mary's crossword. He looks at it closely, totally confused. It takes him more than a second to get it. He laughs -- then suddenly reality sets in. 
STEVE Jesus. 
INT. HOROWITZ HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT 
Mary does a crossword while soaking in the bathtub. Without missing an answer, she reaches over the side of the tub, grabs the telephone on the floor. She checks the dial tone, hangs up quickly, continues with the puzzle. 
MARY Four letter word for am I going to wait my whole life for Steve to call? She suddenly stops writing. 
MARY Nope. She flails out of the tub like a salmon heading upstream, grabs a towel barely big enough to cover her. Without any effort to dry off, she runs out of the bathroom. 
INT. HOROWITZ HOUSE - HALLWAY / LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Towel wrapped around her but barely covering, Mary reaches the top of the stairs. Her wet feet sliding all over the place, she opts for the safety of a banister slide. She gets up on it, slides a few inches before realizing what a bad idea it was. 
MARY Ow ow ouch. She gets off the banister, slops the rest of the way down the stairs, jumps into the doorway of the living room. 
MARY The news is Steve's life! It's not just what he does, it's who he is, imbedded deep down in his polymer of nucleotides. I should be out there by his side. That's what girlfriends do, isn't it? Let him concentrate on his work. I'll concentrate on the relationship. It won't be easy, I know, but neither is quantum physics or... the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle or... paper mache, but I've managed to do fine with those, haven't I? She looks at her parents. They sit at a table playing bridge with MR. and MRS. HANCOCK. 
MRS. HOROWITZ Mary, you remember the Hancocks. 
MARY Top of the evening. Mr. Hancock checks out Mary's bare legs as she stands in a puddle of bath water. Mrs. Hancock lifts her husband's chin, snaps him out of it. 
MRS. HANCOCK Loved this week's puzzle, dear. Whoever Steve is, he must be a very lucky young man. Mr. Horowitz gives Mrs. Hancock a look - "don't encourage her". 
STEVE But then we wouldn't have heard about horse heaven. Josh and Angus laugh. 
HARTMAN It's that kind of genius that won me the Southeast Idaho Christian Family Coalition's Journalist of the Year award, you ingrates. 
INT. GREYHOUND BUS - NIGHT 
The bus is full. Most PASSENGERS sleep. Mary sits in the aisle seat of the first row, a BURLY MAN in his 60's beside her. The light above their seats illuminates the crossword puzzle he's working on. Mary looks over his shoulder, points to the blank spaces in his puzzle. 
MARY Omaha... Einstein... cholera... grenade... Bach... oui... potbelly... Oreo. The man drops the crossword, glares at her. 
MARY Sorry. She looks away, starts biting her nails, then spots a sign on the freeway, calls-out to the Driver and anybody else who will listen. 
MARY Bessemer, Alabama! Named after Sir Henry Bessemer, a Brit. Guess what he did? Perfected the way steel is made, of course. 
(MORE) 
MARY (cont'd) I won't bore you with the whole story, just the best parts, like how it involves molten pig iron which does not, as one might think, have anything to do with pigs. It's actually a raw iron made from iron ore, plus limestone, plus coke - and by coke I mean the carbonaceous residue, not the cola, or the booger sugar. Mary looks around for a response -- nothing. 
MARY You know what else is in Bessemer? The city, I mean? Hitler's typewriter. It's crazy, I know. That guy was such an asshole. The Driver's eyes glaze over. Please let this and. 
EXT. REST STOP - NIGHT 
The bus pulls into the rundown rest stop. 
INT. GREYHOUND BUS - NIGHT 
The Driver looks at the passengers. Most of them are still sleeping. 
DRIVER We'll just take five minutes here. He steps off the bus. Mary turns to the man next to her. 
MARY Can you watch my stuff? He glares at her -- you have got to be kidding. Mary grabs her backpack and Kroger bag and steps off the bus. 
INT. REST STOP - NIGHT 
Mary walks into the restaurant, heads toward the ladies room. On her way, she spots a television behind the counter. A few DINERS watch. Mary joins them. On the TV: "MEDIEVAL TIMES HOSTAGE CRISIS". 
HARTMAN (on TV) Perhaps the greatest obstacle the hostage negotiators face is the suspect's refusal to communicate using modern day technology. In keeping with his role as a medieval knight, he's insisting on an eleventh century messenger to deliver all communication. The screen splits with a female news ANCHOR. 
ANCHOR What are we talking about here, Hartman? Carrier pigeons? 
MARY Homing pigeons. A few of the Diners overhear. 
HARTMAN Actually, homing pigeons. The Diners look at Mary. 
MARY Carrier pigeons, despite their name, are more or less useless when it comes to actually carrying anything. Homing pigeons are better for messenger work... The Diners lose interest. Mary catches the eye of a WANDERER at the end of the counter. He's hanging on her every word. 
MARY You know who used them all the time? Genghis Khan. Loved the pigeons, scared to death of pooches though. The Wanderer just stares at her. 
MARY You know, dogs, canines, de honden? Still nothing. She looks back at the TV. 
ANCHOR Have the negotiators located any homing pigeons? Where do you even get them in this day and age? 
HARTMAN You can buy them on the internet for twenty-five bucks a pop. Mary looks at the Diners, smiles, points to the TV. 
MARY My boyfriend is probably holding that camera right now. The Diners ignore her and just eat their pie. Mary realizes the time, runs out of the rest stop. 
EXT. REST STOP - NIGHT 
Mary runs out into the parking lot. The bus is gone. 
MARY Crap! Crap, crap, crap! She looks down the road -- no sign of the bus anywhere. She takes her paper bag out of her pocket, breathes into it. A TRUCK DRIVER passes her with coffee in hand, on his way to his rig. 
ANGUS You let you mother set you up? What the hell is wrong with you? There's a commotion in the distance. Every photographer on the grounds focuses on the castle. Reporters jump into position. Hartman touches up his make-up, roots through his bag. He yells out to Steve, Angus and Josh. 
HARTMAN Which one of you bastards hid my bronzing shimmer? The police surrounding the castle take aim. Dead silence as the Medieval Times drawbridge lowers. A KNIGHT walks out, arms raised as high as his squeaking armor will allow, which is not very high, but high enough to get the point across -- Surrender. 
INT. NORM'S TRUCK -- NIGHT 
Norm drives as Mary drones on while flipping through a truck repair manual. 
MARY And my other rule about crossword puzzles is this. No pencils. Doing a crossword with a pencil is like screaming with your lips duct taped together. It's weak. 
(MORE) 
MARY (cont'd) If you're going to do a crossword, you should do it fearlessly, with abandon, and with a pen. I prefer a medium tip, felt, blue - 
NORM Quiet time might be good right about now. 
MARY Oh. She thinks about it, whispers. 
MARY Do you mean quiet as in softly hushed like this? Or do you mean quiet, as in silent? He nods. Mary squeezes her lips together, holds them. It lasts for about a second. 
MARY Norm? 
NORM What? 
MARY Thanks for not raping me. 
NORM My pleasure. 
EXT. ROUTE 20 - DAY 
As the sun comes up, Norm's truck drives into Dallas. 
EXT. MEDIEVAL TIMES - DALLAS - DAY 
Norm's truck drives away, leaving Mary standing on the side of Interstate 35. She looks across the road to the Medieval Times -- it's completely deserted. 
MARY Eight letter word for "screwed". Mary crosses to the Medieval Times parking lot, steps over the police line blowing in the wind. 
MARY F-A-S-T-E-N-E-D. Fastened. 
She looks around. There's nobody for miles. 
MARY (V.O.) That's what's great about crosswords, and life. Every once in a while, you get a surprise. She heads back to the interstate, starts walking. 
INT. BUS STATION - DAY 
Mary walks past TV in the bus station tuned to Fox News. On every screen - images of an upset WOMAN dodging press to get through the doors of Children's Hospital, Oklahoma City. The screen caption: "The Fight for Baby Peggy". 
EXT. CITY STREET -- DAY 
Mary talks on a pay phone. 
MARY All roads lead to Oklahoma, Papa. 
INT. HOROWITZ HOUSE - DAY 
Mary's parents share the phone. 
MR. HOROWITZ Last time I checked, freeway 20 still heads right back here. 
EXT. CITY STREET - DAY 
STEVE Tell me you didn't come all the way here just to see me. 
MARY Of course not... I went to Dallas looking for you first. And you know why? Steve grabs his head. This is not happening. 
MARY Because you're inimitable and I'm intransigent. 
STEVE No, we're not. I don't know what that means but trust me. We're so not. 
MARY It means you're awesome and I'm unstoppable. 
STEVE Great. Listen, Mary, you seem like a nice girl, and the ten minutes we spent together were -- 
MARY Mind blowing. At a complete loss, he just goes along. 
STEVE Sure, but I'm working here. Working. 
Mary points to the partially hidden side door of the hospital. A MAN with his face covered, in a nurse's uniform and dress shoes, sneaks out the door unnoticed. 
MARY I know. I'm just here to support you, show you I care, and also ask why you aren't following that guy pretending to be a nurse but obviously not wearing sterilizable, non-slip footwear. Steve looks toward the hospital, spots the Man. 
MARY If I was Baby Peggy's dad, that's how I'd avoid the press too. Steve takes off running. Mary yells out to him. 
MARY I'll be right here in case you want to make out later on! Steve looks back, a bunch of people stare. Mary waves to him then watches until he's out of sight. A SECURITY GUARD approaches her. 
SECURITY GUARD Miss, if you want to be here, you're going to have to stay behind the fence. Mary turns to see what he's pointing at - the growing crowd of protestors off in the distance. They wave their signs around, cry, sing and sway together, their painful song barely audible from afar. 
PROTESTORS Near, far, wherever you are, we believe that the leg should stay on... Mary watches, paralyzed with awe, like seeing herself in the mirror for the first time ever. At last, she has found her people. 
EXT. OKLAHOMA PROTESTORS CAMP - DAY 
An overweight 30ish woman ELIZABETH (who shouldn't be wearing those low rise pants and cropped tee) lights a bunch of candles in the grass behind the protestor fence. She reaches the last candle in line just as Mary walks up to join the group. Elizabeth looks up at Mary, smiles. 
ELIZABETH I like your boots. 
MARY Thanks. I found them in an alley. Elizabeth looks at the boots again, impressed. She stands up. 
ELIZABETH Are you pro-leg or anti-leg? 
MARY Neither really. 
ELIZABETH This is the pro-leg group over here. We're supporting Baby Peggy's dad in his fight to save the baby's third leg. She points to the end of the fenced off area where only a few protestors hold anti-leg signs:"NORMAL LIFE FOR BABY PEGGY", 
"3 LEGS ARE NOT BETTER THAN 2". 
ELIZABETH Those are the anti-leggers. They're all for the amputation. 
MARY I'm just here because my boyfriend is working the story. He's with CNN, the world's news leader, the most trusted name in news, the place where more - 
ELIZABETH The pro-leggers have better snacks. 
MARY I'm definitely pro-leg. 
Elizabeth smiles, hands Mary a candle. 
INT. HOROWITZ HOUSE -- NIGHT 
Mr. and Mrs. Horowitz watch TV and read at the same time. The TV is on mute --- CNN's Baby Peggy coverage. In the corner of the screen, "amputation countdown - 35 hours". Shots of the protestors' candlelight vigil appear on the screen. Mrs. Horowitz spots Mary in the crowd, standing next to Elizabeth. She sings and waves her candle around, all the while straining to look for Steve. 
MRS. HOROWITZ There she is! Abe, look! There she is right there. Mr. Horowitz glances up from his book. 
MR. HOROWITZ She's going to set her hair on fire with that candle. 
MARY Of course. I don't want to interfere in his work but I just need to be here for him and - He grabs her, hugs her in so her words are all muffled - and yet she keeps talking. 
HARTMAN Good girl. The SECURITY GUARD walks past, gestures that they should be behind the fence. Hartman holds up his press pass to get rid of the Guard, then lets go of Mary. He points her toward the protestors, starts backing away. 
HARTMAN I'll tell Steve to come find you when we wrap for the day. What side are you on? 
MARY Pro-leg. She shows him her button featuring a cartoon of a very happy three legged baby. Hartman laughs. 
HARTMAN You might want to jump camps. No way they're going let that baby keep the third leg and live like a freak. Trust me. He waves and turns around, starts heading for the press camp. Mary calls out to him. 
MARY She'd just be like the tree frogs. Hartman turns around. What? 
MARY A trematode parasite causes polymely (that means extra limbs) in tree frogs. It happens all the time. In some ponds there's like a quarter of the tree frogs with extra legs. Totally natural. Hartman looks at her like she's a nutcase. 
EXT. OKLAHOMA MEDIA CAMP - NIGHT 
Angus is on his phone as Steve rushes to set up his equipment. Hartman arrives back at the van. 
HARTMAN What's going on? Josh rushes to get the mic on Hartman. 
JOSH The parents of the kid got back together. Surgery's cancelled. 
HARTMAN No amputation? 
STEVE Tell me you weren't talking to Mary. 
HARTMAN Who? 
STEVE Go to hell, Hughes. scans it Angus hands Hartman the press release. Hartman quickly. 
HARTMAN It's over? The kid keeps the leg. 
ANGUS For now. Hartman checks his teeth in a hand mirror. 
HARTMAN 'Til she gets it caught in a car door. 
EXT. OKLAHOMA PROTESTORS CAMP - NIGHT 
News spreads around the pro-leg protestors camp. They all start hollering with joy. The disappointed anti-leg protestors ditch their signs and storm off. 
INT. HOROWITZ HOUSE - NIGHT 
Mr. Horowitz is asleep in front of the TV. He wakes up as the amputation countdown clock on the news stops. 
EXT. OKLAHOMA CITY CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL - NIGHT 
The news crews line the hospital entrance once again. 
KOCO REPORTER With mere hours to spare, the Dunlevys reconciled, agreeing to halt surgery until Baby Peggy is old enough to decide for herself. Further down the row of reporters: 
FOX NEWS REPORTER And while dozens of children fight for their lives behind these walls, Baby Peggy won't be one of them. With surgery cancelled, it's time for the Dunlevys to be a family once again. Past a few more news crews, at the end the line, Steve has the camera on Hartman. 
HARTMAN And like the noble tree frog whose extra leg is nothing if not natural, so Baby Peggy begins the rest of her three legged life... This is Hartman Hughes reporting live from Oklahoma City. Hartman pulls out his ear piece. Angus, Josh and Steve all look at him, a bit surprised. 
STEVE Tree frog? Where do you get this shit? Hartman taps the side of his head -- it's all up here. 
HARTMAN A little thing called astutitude, my friends. Steve and Angus look at each other -- is that even a word? 
EXT. OKLAHOMA PROTESTORS CAMP - NIGHT 
Mary celebrates with the other protestors. The Protestor and his Protestor Wife cry tears of joy. Mary pulls a tissue out of her bag, hands it over. The husband takes it, turns away and wipes his eyes. 
HARTMAN He was going to go ask you himself but look at the poor bastard. So sick he can't even sit up straight. 
MARY What if it's a viral zoonotic disease? He should see a doctor. 
HARTMAN Exactly what I told him, but the only person he wants touching his infected flesh is you. Mary looks at Steve, worried. 
MARY But wait, what if - up. Hartman grabs her face, squishes her lips to shut her 
HARTMAN Hey now, we need you to be strong for him. Leachinan trial, Santa Fe, can you remember that? Mary nods, unable to speak. 
HARTMAN We'll meet you there, God willing. 
He lets go of her face. 
MARY Will you take care of him? 
HARTMAN Like he's my own. She backs away from the window. Angus waves to her and starts driving. 
ANGUS Nothing wrong with that one. 
JOSH Except for those boots. 
STEVE You're an asshole, Hughes. Hartman laughs. 
EXT. RENTAL VAN - NIGHT 
Mary watches the van drive away. 
EXT. OKLAHOMA PROTESTORS CAMP - NIGHT 
Only a few protestors remain. Abandoned signs and garbage cover the grass. Elizabeth gets autographs from other protestors like it's the last day of high school. Mary runs up, grabs her bags. 
MARY Elizabeth! I have to meet Steve at his next job, in New Mexico. He's sick, not as in rad, although he is that too, but more like unwell, infirm, perhaps barfy. Hopefully nothing serious but you never can be too sure and besides, healthy or not, he needs me. 
ELIZABETH Sign my book before you go? Elizabeth hands her the ratty hand decorated book and a pen. 
MARY The trip's not too long, right through all kinds of interesting sites like, for example, El Santuario de Chimayo: The Lourdes of America. Know what that is? A sacred sand pit near a burrito stand. What could be better than that? Mary looks away from Elizabeth, fidgets a bit. 
MARY Want to go? Unless you're busy, I mean. You probably have something better to do. Elizabeth thinks about it. 
ELIZABETH Not really. Mary is stunned. She takes a minute to realize it's real, gets excited. From behind her: 
HOWARD (O.S.) I'll go too. Mary turns around and spots Howard. 
ELIZABETH Mary, have you met Howard? Mary shakes her head. Howard offers his hand. It's got dried chocolate milk all over it. She takes it. 
ELIZABETH Mary, Howard. Howard, Mary. Mary, Howard's got a car, you know. He can drive us. Mary looks at him, thinks about it. 
MARY What kind of car do you have? 
HOWARD Plymouth Colt. 
MARY What year? 
HOWARD Eighty-nine. Mary quickly scans her memory. 
MARY Replace the recalled seat belts? 
HOWARD Yes. Mary thinks about it, smiles. 
MARY Let's grab souvenirs! Elizabeth and Howard each pick up a Baby Peggy sign off the ground. Mary grabs as many as she can hold -- way, way too many. A bunch of them slide off but she perseveres. 
EXT. SANTA FE FEDERAL COURT HOUSE - MEDIA CAMP - DAY 
Mary walks among the news vans. At the entrance to a nearby tent, Hartman spots her, waves her over. 
HARTMAN Hi gorgeous. What'd you do to your hair? 
MARY Slept on it in the car. Where's Steve? Is he okay? 
HARTMAN Never better. Come in and wait. He'll be back soon. 
INT. MEDIA TENT - DAY 
A briefing area is set up - folding chairs, table, podium. A bunch of male journalists sit around the table playing poker - Vince (CNN), DOUG (CNN), the COURT TV REPORTER, a BBC NEWS PHOTOGRAPHER, a FRENCH PHOTOGRAPHER, A SPANISH JOURNALIST and Angus. Hartman escorts Mary in. The guys perk up a bit. 
HARTMAN You all know Mary? Steve's girlfriend? Mary shakes hands around the table, greets them all in their native tongues. 
MARY Hello... Bonjour... Hola... Jolly afternoon... She gets to Angus. He kisses her hand. 
ANGUS My dear, sit. He shoves the BBC guy out of the way to make room for Mary next to him. Vince shuffles the cards. 
VINCE Mary, you in? 
MARY Poker? Technically I'm familiar but I've never actually played. With people, I mean. 
SPANISH JOURNALIST She's in. Doug throws in some cash as Vince starts to deal. 
EXT. SANTA FE FEDERAL COURT HOUSE - SPECTATORS AREA - DAY 
Howard wanders through the crowd wearing an "I V Cloris" t- shirt over his own. He passes a VENDOR selling "Innocence Beads", "Acquittal Incense" and "autographed" Cloris Leachman photos. The crowd continues to grow. A Candles are lit, healing rituals performed, donuts passed around. 
INT. MEDIA TENT - DAY 
Mary holds her cards close to her. 
MARY "There are few things that are so unpardonably neglected in our country as poker." Guess who said that one. She looks around the table. The guys, except Angus, are starting to lose their patience. 
MARY Mark Twain. And you know what else- 
BBC NEWS PHOTOGRAPHER Darling, you in or not? 
MARY Sorry. Mary looks at her cards, thinks about it for way too long, then grabs a handful of coins from her Kroger bag, slaps them on the table. 
MARY Send it, ladies! Steve steps into the tent, spots Mary, turns to run back out. 
HARTMAN Don't go, Steve! Look who's here. Mary jumps up - just about knocks the table over, then sustains a number of injuries trying to leap over chairs. At last she makes it to Steve, hugs him. 
MARY Thank God you're okay! 
He looks over her shoulder and mouths "you're dead" to Hartman. 
TO He holds her back at arm's length, looks at her, goes speak then stops himself, pulls her outside the tent. 
EXT. MEDIA TENT - DAY 
Steve tries to stay calm talking to Mary. 
STEVE You have to stop stalking me. 
MARY I'm not. It's more like picking travel destinations based on where you happen to be working. 
STEVE Stalking. 
HARTMAN Mary, millions of people believe what I tell them every night. Why shouldn't you? Steve dives at him. Hartman swings and gets him right in the nose. One of their cell phones ring, then another, then all the guys' phones go off. 
ANGUS Verdict's in. They all rush off to the court house, leaving a stunned Mary standing alone. 
MARY He fought for me. Happiest moment of her life. 
EXT. SANTA FE FEDERAL COURT HOUSE - DAY 
The crowd cheers as CLORIS LEACHMAN is whisked out of the court house and into a police car. She waves to her fans as she goes. The Court TV Reporter is on camera. 
COURT TV REPORTER The end to a difficult and often emotional trial, the verdict finally in, Cloris Leachman found not guilty of the murder of her twenty-six year old lover Juan Carlos Velasquez. Down the row of journalists, the BBC CREW. 
BBC JOURNALIST After a devastating eight months, Leachman at last vindicated despite overwhelming evidence against her. Six more cameras down, the French Reporter. 
FRENCH REPORTER 
(SUBTITLED) Eyewitness testimony, fingerprints on every inch of the body, the murder weapon still warm in her Chanel handbag - And finally at the end of the line, Hartman - his hair a mess, his lip cut, his mood sour. A few feet away filming, Steve's nose bleeds down his chin and shirt. 
HARTMAN And as she left the court room today a free woman, the cheers of her devoted fans carrying her forward - 
MARY (O.S.) 
OH MY GOD, STEVE, YOU'RE BLEEDING! The camera is knocked out of position as Mary rushes Steve. Angus steps in and pulls her away. A COP grabs her. Mary looks back to Steve as she's dragged back to the fan area. 
MARY Please! Somebody help him! Apply a vasoconstrictor, a nasal tampon, anything! At the absolute least, direct pressure and a clean tissue! Steve puts the camera back in place. Hartman recovers fast. 
HARTMAN As you can see, Cloris Leachman's fans have become surprisingly violent despite her victory here today. Add this to the list of the most dangerous locations for journalists. Iraq, Somalia, Lebanon, Sri Lanka... and just about any place Cloris Leachman fans gather. Hartman wipes blood from his lip. 
HARTMAN Hartman Hughes putting his life at risk to report live from Santa Fe, New Mexico. They cut. Hartman grabs a hand mirror, points to his face, yells out to Steve. 
HARTMAN This is my gift, understand, my instrument. Makes no difference if you're walking around looking like Quasimodo. Ignoring Hartman, Steve walks over to Angus. 
STEVE How long do you figure until - Steve's phone rings. He cringes, answers it. 
INT. CNN ATLANTA - DAY

EXT. SANTA FE FEDERAL COURT HOUSE - DAY 
Steve hesitates on the phone. 
STEVE This girl. She's been following me... She's not my girlfriend... He listens, clenches his teeth, hands the phone to Angus. As Angus listens, Steve grabs his equipment, waits in dread. Angus hangs up the phone, hands it back to Steve. 
STEVE I'm done? 
ANGUS Consider yourself temporarily saved by the storm. It's worse than they thought. We've got to move. Steve grabs his equipment. They start walking. 
ANGUS He'll probably fire you after. 
MARY (O.S.) I can't think of work at a time like this! 
MRS. HOROWITZ You can't chase that boy any more. If he doesn't appreciate you it's ridiculous to -

INT. GREYHOUND BUS STATION - LOS ANGELES - NIGHT 
Mary yells on the phone. PASSENGERS start to stare. 
MARY I rest my case! If you gave up the first time dad said no then I wouldn't exist. Telling me to give up so soon on my potential husband- to-be, birth father of my twelve future children and adoptive father of my gerbil Carol -- you might as well be saying that you wish you had given up too and that you never married dad and that I'd never been born. Is that what you're saying? 
INT. HOROWITZ HOUSE - NIGHT 
Mrs. Horowitz looks at her husband. 
MRS. HOROWITZ Give Steve my best.

Elizabeth stands at the bus to Oklahoma City, a pile of Leachman signs at her feet. Mary approaches.

MARY Eight letter word for... my life has come to this. There's a bit of shuffling around in the dark. 
MARY Not destiny, that's only seven letters. Not fortuity - that sounds more like when good things happen to people like finding a quarter in the sofa or something. I mean the not so great stuff that's bound to befall some people more than others. Fate's nasty cousin, I mean. Suddenly Mary's face lights up with her mini keychain flashlight. 
MARY F-O-R-E-D-0-0-M. Foredoom. 
A Mary shines the light on her knee. Her previous cut is now gaping wound, blood is all over the place. 
MARY Crap.

Near the hole, the Rescue Supervisor consults with the other rescuers and a MINE SAFETY EXPERT. 
RESCUE SUPERVISOR The new equipment is going to take a while. Let's try and find out what kind of shape our victim's in. 
RESCUER Can we lower a phone down in there? 
MINE SAFETY EXPERT Not at those depths, this whole area is bad enough above ground. We'll never get a signal down there. 
RESCUE SUPERVISOR Let's keep it simple. Get me a flashlight, a piece of paper and a pencil. An unenthusiastic Hartman steps in front of the camera, the Rescuers in the shot behind him. Doug films. Hartman goes to speak but can't seem to summon his on air personality. 
HARTMAN Behind inc... Oh what's the point? Hartman walks away moping.

A RETIRED MINE SUPERVISOR comments as a graphic shows the cross section of the mine. As he talks, the graphic animates with a female figure in red boots tumbling into the mine and bouncing off the walls all the way down -- and it plays over and over. 
RETIRED MINE SUPERVISOR That area was never reinforced up above, no need since the whole eastern tunnel was blocked off in the late Seventies. Of course that would also affect the air quality down there. 
ANCHOR That has to be bad news for Mary Horowitz, wouldn't you say? 
RETIRED MINE SUPERVISOR Definitely not looking good.

The Rescue Supervisor talks to the Mine Safety Expert. 
RESCUE SUPERVISOR We've got the whole country watching now, can't afford any more mistakes. The crane from Shreveport is a wash. We're looking at as much as sixteen hours to bring the other one in. 
MINE SAFETY EXPERT Sixteen hours? If we've got carbon monoxide - 
RESCUE SUPERVISOR There's air coming in through the top. 
MINE SAFETY EXPERT Even at a concentration of 5ppm, they could suffocate... We do not have sixteen hours. 
The Rescue supervisor looks toward the hole, of the severity and hopelessness of their situation showing on his face. 
RESCUE SUPERVISOR Let's at least get some food and water down there. The rope we've got on there now will handle a small load -- if that damn crane holds. He looks up at the old crane, worried. 
MINE SAFETY EXPERT Gas masks, oxygen supply, how long? The Rescue Supervisor points around the area - look where we are. 
RESCUE SUPERVISOR As fast as we can get them here. 
MINE SAFETY EXPERT Might not be soon enough. 
INT. FOX NEWS - DAY

WAGA Cindy interviews a 30ish male SCIENTIST. 
SCIENTIST I knew Mary Horowitz in college. She caught me trying to cheat off her physics midterm, lectured me for an hour and when she finally stopped talking I asked her out. She said no, said it was because I was, get this - hebetudinous. Can you believe? He walks away, bitter, gets back to work on NASA rockets.

STEVE Mary... she's smart, incredibly smart. She talks a lot. Never boring, I'll tell you that much. He thinks about her, gets lost in it. 
STEVE Mary Horowitz doesn't pretend to be anything she's not. She's passionate, beautiful, real... and she definitely doesn't deserve to be where she is now.

Mary motions for the Little Deaf Girl to jump on piggyback. She jumps up onto Mary's back, still in the red rubber boots.

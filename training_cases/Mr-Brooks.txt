DETECTIVE ATWOOD I really hated yesterday, Snyder, and then today came along. 
As she gets out of the car, the Men notice the bandages on her wrists and falling into step with her on the way to the house. 
SNYDER (OLDER DETECTIVE) What happened to your wrists? 
Atwood holds up her hands to reveal the extent of the bandages. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD I tried to commit suicide. 
The Young Detective laughs. Atwood whirls on him. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD What's so funny? 
YOUNG DETECTIVE Eh... I... I don't know, I heard it was because you were drunk and got into a fight with a fish tank. 
Atwood sticks her finger into the Young Detective's chest. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD Who are you gonna believe? Me or the fucking fish?! 
YOUNG DETECTIVE Eh... you. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD Good. 
Atwood turns and leaves the Men. 
YOUNG DETECTIVE (under his breath) She's nuts! 
SNYDER And rich. 
They catch up to Atwood who has squatted down to examine the lock on the front door. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
SNYDER There are some scratches in the side door cylinder. Other than that no signs of forced entry. The alarm was armed and we even had to cut the security chains to get in. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD (straightens up) This guy hasn't been active for over two years... 
She enters the house. 
INT. MURDER HOUSE Ñ AFTERNOON 
From the way Atwood looks at her surroundings as she crosses the Living Room we get the feel that this Woman misses nothing. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD ... we think he's either dead or in jail on some other charge. This is probably a copycat. 
Detective Snyder points her down the Hall toward the Bedroom and follows. 
SNYDER That's why we called you. You're the God that tells us peons if we have a simple murder here or something we can dump on you. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD Bite yourself. 
Atwood arrives in the doorway of the BEDROOM where the murders took place and stops. 
The Bodies of the dance Couple are now on the floor. The Man is propped up against the bed in a sitting position. The Woman has her head in the Man's crotch. 
Almost like Mr. Brooks, Atwood's nostrils flare, but in Atwood's case it's not the scent of death that arouses her but it's like she's searching for the scent of her prey. 
In a glance she memorizes the Room, then steps inside. 
INT. BEDROOM Ñ AFTERNOON 
The Crime Scene TECHNICIANS shift to accommodate Atwood's inspection. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD (indicating the Victims) He always rearranges the bodies, but this is out of character. He has never left them in such a crude position. Usually it's more romantic with their arms around each other, kissing, their mouths open, their tongues touching. 
SNYDER So we have a copycat? 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD Where are the thumbprints? 
Snyder points to a bare space of wall above the bed. Atwood leans in to look at two bloody 'thumbprints' placed side by side. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD One his one hers? 
SNYDER That's what it looks like. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD What's that? 
There are two holes gouged into the plaster of the wall. 
SNYDER The bullets went completely through the victims. The killer recovered the slugs. 
Atwood unfolds and after another look around the room goes to the window and cracks the curtains. 
There's the four story Apartment Building across the alley, its windows staring down at her. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD Were these open or closed when you got here? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
SNYDER Closed. 
Atwood tries the cord, the curtains are stuck. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD Hmm... 
MARSHALL You're such a fucking hypocrite. If you were honest you would step out there and say 'Hi, I'm Earl. I killed two people last night and I really got off on it, but I need your help to be cured.' 
MR. BROOKS I'm different Marshall, I won't argue that with you. This is the only place that has ever helped me be normal and I've been straight up until last night for the past two years. I'm not going to kill again and I'm not going to quit coming here because it upsets you. 
MARSHALL Yeah but for the next 29 days you're going to have to step out there and say 'Hi, I'm Earl, I'm an addict.' And everybody will know you fell off the wagon. Don't you feel stupid doing that? 
MR. BROOKS No. I feel good. 
EXT. INDUSTRIAL SECTION OF CHICAGO Ñ DAY 
A Cab arrives at the Front Entrance of the BROOKS BOX FACTORY, a long three story brick Building. 
A YOUNG WOMAN, 19, is dropped off along with an assortment of luggage and boxes. 
INT. BROOKS BOX FACTORY Ñ DAY 
It's loud. We follow a thin piece of cardboard as one machine deals it off the bottom of a stack into the maw of another machine. 
That machine prints one side of the cardboard blue. 
It is handed off to the third machine which cuts the flaps. The fourth machine folds and glues those flaps and spits the piece of cardboard out onto a conveyor belt as a box. 
Wearing safety glasses and ear protectors along with his business suit, Mr. Brooks picks up the box and hands it to one of three similarly attired MEN, standing nearby. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MR. BROOKS This is not the top of the line or the bottom, but for the money we're talking about this is the quality I can provide you. 
As Mr. Brooks talks the Men pass the box between them. 
MR. BROOKS Your packaging is the first impression your customers will have of your product... 
PA SYSTEM Mr. Brooks, your daughter is waiting for you in your office. 
A surprised Mr. Brooks grabs a quick look at the PA Speaker, then continues. 
MR. BROOKS ... We'd love to work you with on the design. It's fun to challenge our machines. If you check around, you'll find we're not the cheapest, but we are the best. 
INT. RECEPTION AREA - BROOKS BOX FACTORY Ñ DAY 
On his way through to his office, Mr. Brooks smiles absently at a MAN waiting on the couch. The pleasant-looking Man in his early 30's, nods. 
Mr. Brooks stops at his SECRETARY's desk. 
MR. BROOKS Sunday, did Jane call and say she was coming? 
SUNDAY I would have given you that message, Mr. Brooks. She has boxes and suitcases downstairs. 
MR. BROOKS Hold my calls. 
INT. MR. BROOKS' OFFICE Ñ DAY 
MR. BROOKS (coming in) What are you doing here, Gorgeous? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
The 19 year old Girl we saw arrive by cab stands up and throws her arms around Mr. Brooks. 
JANE I'm sorry, Daddy, please don't be angry with me. 
Mr. Brooks kisses Jane on the forehead and goes to sit at his desk. 
MR. BROOKS I can guess what you've done, but why don't you tell me and then I'll decide. 
JANE I dropped out of school. 
MR. BROOKS Okay. Have you told your mother this? 
JANE No. I wanted to speak to you first. 
MR. BROOKS You'll have to tell her, I'm not going to do that for you, and then together the three of us will decide where to go from here. 
JANE I've thought a lot about this, Dad. College is a waste of time for me. 
MR. BROOKS I don't know how you know that half way through your Freshman year, but... 
JANE You didn't go to college, Dad, and you're successful. I want to come and work for you. 
Sitting on the couch: 
MARSHALL She's not telling you everything, she's hiding something. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
MR. BROOKS I know. (to Jane) I'm not hiring right now. 
JANE Just listen to me. What would happen to the business if, God forbid, something happened to you? Mom would probably have to sell to strangers. I'm willing to start at the bottom, you can treat me as a regular employee, I want to learn everything there is to know about running the box business, and then when the time comes, the business would stay in the family. 
MR. BROOKS That's sweet, but you're talking about emotion, not business. In fact your mother and I came very close to selling out last year. 
JANE What?! 
MR. BROOKS If we had been offered a little more money, and they may come back to us, we will sell. 
Mr. Brooks motions him to a seat. 
MR. SMITH (MAN) (sitting) Before you get the wrong impression, Mr. Brooks, I'm not here to shake you down. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MR. BROOKS (holding up the photos) Then these are the only copies of these photos and you have no others. 
MR. SMITH No. I have other copies and other photos, and if something were to happen to me... 
MR. BROOKS How did you find me, Mr. Smith? 
MR. SMITH You're 'Man of the Year', Mr. Brooks. Your picture was in the paper. If it hadn't been, I don't know what I would have done. 
MR. BROOKS Lucky me. What is it that I can help you with? 
MR. SMITH I've been watching that Couple for months, they liked to make love with the blinds open. Sometimes I would take pictures, you know, visual aides for later. It was fun, it was a great way to get off; I thought, until I saw you kill them. I have to tell you I have never ever felt a rush like that ever. I know you're the Thumbprint killer, you've done this before. What I want is to go with you the next time you kill someone. And I would like that to be soon. 
From the end of the table, Marshall cackles a laugh. 
MARSHALL And you were worried that this was going to be unpleasant. The answer is simple. Just tell him you've decided never to kill again and he'll go away. 
MR. BROOKS You enjoy watching me suffer, don't you? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
MARSHALL In a word, yes. 
MR. BROOKS Where do you think he has the other pictures? 
MARSHALL He put them in a safety deposit box but I'll bet the box is at the bank where he has his checking account and the key is on his keychain. He really wants to do this, he's not going to go to the cops. 
Mr. Smith who has grown uneasy under Mr. Brooks's stare swallows: 
MR. SMITH So do we have a deal? 
MR. BROOKS From the angle of these pictures... (taps the envelope) ... you live on the third floor of the apartment building across the alley from the Couple's house. 
MR. SMITH Well... eh. 
MR. BROOKS Yes or no, Mr. Smith? 
Mr. Smith nods 'yes'. 
MR. BROOKS What time do you get home from work? 
MR. SMITH Six thirty, seven, depending on the traffic. 
MR. BROOKS You can never come here again, you can never call me. Do you understand that? 
MR. SMITH Yes. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) 
MR. BROOKS Tomorrow night, not tonight, tomorrow night, at eight o'clock, leave your apartment and walk east. I'll pick you up. 
MR. SMITH If you're thinking of doing anything to me, Mr. Brooks... 
MR. BROOKS We're both aware of the rules, Mr. Smith, but I feel I must warn you. If it turns out that you enjoy killing, it can become very addictive. It could ruin your life. 
MR. SMITH I want to do this. 
MR. BROOKS (looks at Marshall) Have I covered everything? 
MARSHALL I can't think of anything else. 
Mr. Brooks stands up and opens the door. 
MR. BROOKS I'll see you tomorrow night, Mr. Smith. 
On his way out, Mr. Smith nods. Mr. Brooks closes the door. His chin drops on his chest and he sighs. 
MR. BROOKS (under his breath) Please God, please help me find a way not to do this. 
EXT. DOWNTOWN CHICAGO Ñ DAY 
Detective Atwood comes out of the CROWD on the sidewalk and enters a Highrise. 
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - LAW OFFICES Ñ DAY 
Atwood and her ATTORNEYS, a gray-haired Man in his 60's, and an Asian Woman about the same age as Atwood are on one side of the table. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JESSE, Atwood's soon to be ex-husband, very handsome, slightly younger than Atwood, and SHEILA, his attractive divorce lawyer, sit across from them. 
ASIAN ATTORNEY We've talked to our client and we've come up with a number that we feel is more than fair. 
Atwood is not happy with this. The Attorney slides a sheet of paper to Sheila. She turns it over. On it is written: 
ASIAN ATTORNEY We can have a check for that amount in your office by 6 o'clock. 
In a robe and pajamas, Mr. Brooks comes down the HALLWAY carrying a glass of milk. The door to his Daughter's ROOM is partly open. By the nightlight in the plug at the head of the bed he can see she's asleep. 
INT. BEDROOM Ñ NIGHT 
Mr. Brooks walks to the bed, leans over and kisses his Daughter on the cheek. 
MR. BROOKS (quietly) It's nice to have you home. 
He leaves. 
EXT. CHICAGO - MORNING 
The early rays of the sun are moving down the tall buildings. 
EXT. BROOKS HOUSE Ñ MORNING 
A garbage truck is picking up the trash. 
INT. BROOKS HOUSE Ñ MORNING 
Dressed for work and a smile on his face, Mr. Brooks comes down the stairs. 
In the BREAKFAST ROOM, the mood is decidedly different. His Wife and Daughter are leaning against opposite walls staring at the floor. 
MR. BROOKS What's wrong? 
EMMA Ask your daughter what the real reason is she dropped out of school. 
JANE I keep telling you it's not the reason. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
EMMA You wanted to go to college, you had good grades in High School, your father helped you get into Stanford, we're paying a ton of money, if this is not the reason, then please dear God tell me the reason. 
MR. BROOKS (picking up an orange juice) Why does your mother think you dropped out of school? 
JANE I'm pregnant. (to her Mother) And it's not the reason I dropped out. Being pregnant wouldn't stop me from going to school if I wanted to go. 
MR. BROOKS Who's the father? 
JANE Some guy I was seeing. 
EMMA Does he know? 
JANE Yes, he's a married man and he doesn't want to have anything to do with me. 
EMMA Oh, Honey, I'm so sorry. 
JANE I'm going to have an abortion anyway, so there is nothing to get upset about. I wasn't even going to tell you guys. 
Mr. Brooks looks directly at his Daughter. 
MR. BROOKS There will be no abortion. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
JANE Daddy, you are not going to tell me what to do. It's my body and I will do what I want to do with it. 
Mr. Brooks's eyes find Emma's. Almost imperceptibly she shakes her head 'no'. 
MR. BROOKS (to his Daughter) You're right. I'm sorry. I said it wrong. I'm not trying to tell you what to do. I'm trying to say that a grandchild would be a wonderful gift for your mother and me. 
EMMA Please, Honey, don't have an abortion. 
JANE Would you really want to have a grandchild, even though I'm not married? 
MR. BROOKS Yes. The child is what's important. We would love it and cherish it completely and help you raise it. 
JANE If it means that much to you, I'll think about it. 
INT. GARAGE - BROOKS HOUSE Ñ MORNING 
Walking to the Lexus, Mr. Brooks notices Marshall waiting for him on the passenger side. 
MR. BROOKS (smiles) Well, we were right, she was hiding something. 
MARSHALL (flat) Pregnant's not all of it. She's hiding something bigger. Much bigger. 
MR. BROOKS You think so? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MARSHALL I know so, and so do you. 
INT. CRIME LAB Ñ AFTERNOON 
Large and small Color Photographs pinned to a corkboard create a Collage of the dance Couple murder scene. 
Standing in front of this is CAPTAIN LISTER, a tall slim open- faced Woman in her mid-fifties, and the lead Crime Scene Technician we saw earlier at the Murder House. 
TECHNICIAN It's not what's here, it's what's not here that's interesting. There's not a trace of anything foreign. If I didn't know better I'd say these people were killed by a ghost. 
CAPTAIN LISTER The autopsy found a tiny piece of plastic in the female victim's brain. 
With a key she lets herself in. 
EXT. STREET Ñ NIGHT 
Parked against the curb opposite the driveway of the Murder House is an old green Pontiac Convertible with the top up. 
The driver's window is down and from inside a WOMAN, late 20's, is watching the house. 
INT. MURDER HOUSE Ñ NIGHT 
Atwood stops in the PANTRY almost in the exact spot where Mr. Brooks stopped. 
The quiet is filled by the rain drumming on the roof. The wind rattles the windows. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD How did you know where they were in the house? 
She steps into the KITCHEN. On the way across she bumps into a chair. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD It's darker tonight than it was on your night. But still how did you manage not to bump into the furniture? Did you have a little light? That would be too dangerous. I'll bet you were in the house before. (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: DETECTIVE ATWOOD (CONT'D) So I should ask the neighbors if they saw a meter reader around the house or a telephone repairman or someone from the gas company. 
These musings take her through the LIVING ROOM to the entrance of the HALLWAY where she pauses and looks both ways. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD Once again, how did you know where they were? Did you check the rooms before you found them? She had his semen in her vagina, they had just made love, did you hear them or was there a light on? 
She steps into the HALL. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD And when did you bag the gun? Because even though I'm sure you're an expert at it, there's still a chance of noise from the plastic. 
She continues down the HALL to the BEDROOM. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD Was the door open or did you have to open it? 
She opens the door and goes in. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD Were they asleep or awake? Was the light on, or did you turn it on? Because I know you, you wouldn't risk a shot in the dark. 
She turns on the overhead light. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD Too bright. What if it wasn't that light that was on, but this one? 
She turns on a bedside light and goes back to the door and turns off the overhead. 
If the dance Couple were on the bed and their blood was not on the wall, the room would look exactly the way it did when Mr. Brooks said 'hello'. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD That's better... What thrill do you get by killing people? Is it sexual, is it hate, is it power? Do you feel remorse? Probably that part of your brain doesn't exist. Do you have emotions of love or affection or joy? Or have you learned to fake them so you won't stand out in a crowd. 
She's at the window now, feeling the curtains. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD What if these are stuck closed because you yanked them closed? Which means they were open when you came into the room. 
She separates the fabric and looks out the rain-streaked window at the four story building across the alley. There are lights on in almost all the apartment windows. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD If Mr. and Miss Normal made love with the curtains open and the lights on, someone in that building noticed them and may have seen you. 
She allows the fabric to drop back into place and turns to look at the bed. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD Was that what you were angry about? 
INT. APARTMENT BUILDING Ñ NIGHT 
Moving slowly across a neutral colored wall. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD (O.S.) Thank you for your time. 
A door is closed. We come to the corner and are looking down a HALLWAY at Atwood coming toward us. We move to her and arrive just as she raises her fist to knock. 
Before she can, the door opens and she and Mr. Smith who is on his way out of his Apartment are surprised that the other one is suddenly there. Each one takes a half step back. 
Phwap! The manila envelope that was wedged under Mr. Smith's left arm hits the floor. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MR. SMITH Oh! You scared me. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD I'm sorry... (bends down and picks up the envelope) ... I was about to knock. I'm Detective Atwood with the Chicago Police. 
MR. SMITH (accepting the envelope) Thank you. 
Through the open door, Atwood can see Mr. Smith's camera on a table and the collapsed tripod leaning against the wall. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD Are you a photographer... (glances at her list) Mr. Baffert? 
MR. SMITH No... eh, it's kind of a hobby, I just started. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD I don't know if you're aware but there was a murder... 
MR. SMITH Oh, yes in the house across the alley... 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD Did you happen to see anything unusual or suspicious that night around that house? Anything at all? 
MR. SMITH Really? That's it? I thought you might already have someone in mind. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
MR. BROOKS I don't enjoy this, Mr. Smith. I do it because I'm addicted to it. And before you entered my life I had vowed I would never kill again. So this is your party, you can chose anyone you want and we'll do it together. 
MR. SMITH Can it be someone I know? 
MR. BROOKS You never kill someone you know. That's the easiest way to get caught. 
EXT. STREET Ñ NIGHT 
The Toyota enters the traffic. 
INT. APARTMENT BUILDING Ñ NIGHT 
An older WOMAN in a Stewardess uniform is standing in the doorway of her apartment. Atwood is in front of her in the HALL. 
STEWARDESS I wasn't in town that night, my roommate was, maybe he saw something. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD May I speak to him? 
STEWARDESS He's on his way to Tokyo now, he's also a Flight Attendant. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD Did the victims ever leave the curtains in the bedroom open? 
STEWARDESS All the time. I don't know if they thought we couldn't see them "fucking" or they didn't care. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD Here's my card, could you ask your roommate to call me when he gets back, the people at that number will find me any hour of the day or night. 
STEWARDESS I won't be here, but I'll leave him a note. 
EXT. STREET Ñ NIGHT 
Mr. Brooks' Toyota is cruising in the flow of traffic. 
MR. BROOKS (V.O.) ... maybe I already know how to pick the locks on the house, if I don't... 
INT. TOYOTA Ñ NIGHT 
MR. BROOKS ... I buy one of those locks and I practice on it, same with the alarm... some I know how to bypass, some I have to study. 
MR. SMITH You don't mind me asking these questions? 
MR. BROOKS No. This is your first time, you're interested. And you should be if you're... 
A neutral-colored PICKUP swerves out of the next lane into Mr. Brooks' lane. 
MR. SMITH Jesus Christ!! 
Mr. Brooks is forced to slam on his brakes to avoid running up the PICKUP'S tailpipe. 
HOONKK!!! Mr. Brooks angrily lays on the horn. 
The brake lights of the PICKUP flash in response causing Mr. Brooks to brake again. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MR. SMITH Fuck him!! It was his fault!! What an asshole!! 
MARSHALL (leans forward) Maybe Mr. Smith would like to kill the driver of the pickup. 
MR. BROOKS (to Mr. Smith) What about the driver of the pickup? What if we killed him? 
MR. SMITH Oh, fuck, yes!! I've always wanted to kill someone who fucked with me in traffic. 
The PICKUP makes a right onto a side street. Mr. Brooks follows. 
MR. BROOKS Do you want to kill the driver of the pickup or the owner, they may not be the same. 
MR. SMITH The driver. 
MR. BROOKS Okay we'll follow until we get a look at him, or her; would it bother you to kill a woman? 
MR. SMITH No. An asshole's an asshole. 
Mr. Brooks begins to slow down. 
MR. SMITH What are you doing? 
MR. BROOKS The asshole shouldn't know we've decided to follow him, or her. 
EXT. FOUR STORY APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT 
Detective Atwood is on her way out the Outer Door when the hair on the back of her neck stands on end. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Footsteps can be heard running toward her through the rain. 
LARRY She started her career in theology with a lie?! 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD Isn't that what all theology is based on? 
LARRY Did you pass the test? 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD Oh yeah... 
LARRY Don't tell me she ended up as Mother Teresa or the Pope. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD No, she realized very quickly there wasn't enough money in religion for her, the last I heard she'd written a diet book that was very successful. 
LARRY She stayed in religion. 
Atwood smiles, her fingers find Larry's and they intertwine. 
The view floats over the balcony. 
As it slowly drops, the PEOPLE on the dance floor, Couple by Couple, disappear until there are only three Couples left, one of them is Atwood and Larry. Her head is on his shoulder. 
It's a slow dance. 
Larry is very good and wherever he leads, Atwood easily follows. The lights begin to dim and we move in. 
Larry touches his lips to Atwood's neck. She arches back and he kisses her neck again and again. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
His lips move up and find hers, and we are now close on the kiss. Gently the lips separate and we slowly retreat. 
Looking into her eyes, Larry traces her lips with a finger, then replaces that finger with his tongue. 
His lips brush a cheek, down her neck to where it meets her shoulder, his teeth close softly on the muscle, by now we are far enough away to realize that Atwood and Larry have no clothes on and we are: 
INT. HALLWAY - DETECTIVE ATWOOD'S CONDOMINIUM Ñ NIGHT 
What light there is, is coming from a room we can't see. 
Larry nibbles at Atwood collarbone, kisses a breast, strokes his hands down her sides. She shivers. He brushes his lips back and forth across her stomach and then down to where the flesh of her belly meets her pubic hair. 
She's watching all of this in a mirror on the opposite wall. 
Then he sinks to his knees and buries his head between her legs. From low in her throat, Atwood moans. We lose sight of the Couple as we move around a corner. 
INT. BEDROOM Ñ DETECTIVE ATWOOD'S CONDOMINIUM - NIGHT 
It's dark. Atwood is propped up against the headboard, the sheet pulled up over her breasts. 
The door to the BATHROOM opens. Larry dressed in his suit, minus the tie, comes out, kneels on the bed and kisses her. 
LARRY Thank you, this was wonderful. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD For me too. 
LARRY I'll see you then? 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD I'd like that. The money is in the usual place. 
LARRY It's not just the money, Tracy. I like you. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD I like you too, Larry. Send me a bill for the dress and the shoes. 
LARRY I will. Good-night. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD Good-night. 
EXT. MR. BROOKS' CERAMICS STUDIO Ñ NIGHT 
The rain is muffled by the trees. 
Move slowly toward the Building then up the side to peek through the narrow window that circles just below the roof line. 
In the center of the room, the kiln relieves the darkness with a yellow red glow whose rim touches a slash of white light coming from under a door tucked in a corner. 
INT. CERAMICS STUDIO Ñ NIGHT 
We creep through the white light across the floor that's littered with splashes of paint and smears of clay to the office door and peer under it. 
In front of us are chair casters and two bare feet and legs. 
MARSHALL (O.S.) I think that was right. Go back. 
MR. BROOKS (O.S.) We're in. 
MARSHALL (O.S.) With the taxes we pay, you'd think they could make it more difficult to hack into the Police personnel files. 
We tip toe under the door. 
INT. OFFICE - CERAMICS STUDIO Ñ NIGHT 
It's crammed with file cabinets. Sketches for pottery pieces are taped to the walls along with photos of Mr. Brooks, Jane and Emma. 
(CONTINUED) 
Atwood stands up with her coffee. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD I'd like to get this done as soon as possible. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
The Asian Attorney also stands and gathering her papers and coffee. 
ASIAN ATTORNEY Are you working on the Thumbprint Killer this time? 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD Yeah. 
ASIAN ATTORNEY That one's creepy to me. The doors are locked, the alarms are armed and the people are dead. It makes you feel like you're not safe anywhere. 
Atwood nods and opens the front door then follows the Attorney out. 
EXT. SUBURBAN STARBUCKS Ñ MORNING 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD Where are you parked? 
ASIAN ATTORNEY I'm right over there. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD I'm down the street. Call me as soon as you have something. 
She starts to walk away. 
ASIAN ATTORNEY Oh, Tracy... I almost forgot, your husband says there's a picture of him holding some trophy that you still have. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD He took all those pictures. He took everything. 
ASIAN ATTORNEY He claims it's his favorite picture and you put it up where you store your suitcases. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD I'll look. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
ASIAN ATTORNEY I know it's petty, but you're going through a divorce. 
EXT. SIDEWALK Ñ MORNING 
Atwood strides toward her car. The PEDESTRIAN traffic is light. It's too early for the stores to be open. 
Up ahead a BROWN VAN is idling at the curb, the sliding side door is open. Atwood can see inside. Empty except for some furniture blankets. 
The Person in the Driver's seat turns to look into the back. It's the Woman who was watching Atwood outside the Murder House. Her hands are unseen in leather gloves. 
She looks up and their eyes meet. Two strangers. The contact is instantly broken. 
Atwood takes a deep breath and smiles. After the rain, the air is brisk and clean. It's good to be alive. 
SLAM!!! Atwood is body-checked by a Man who springs out of the recess of a doorway. His arms wrap around her, she's lifted off her feet and the Man throws himself and her into the Van. 
INT. BROWN VAN - MORNING 
Oooff!! The wind is knocked out of Atwood when she lands left shoulder first on the furniture blankets, the Man on top of her. 
The Man is Thorton Meeks, the Hangman, six feet, a solid two hundred pounds. He's also wearing tight leather gloves. 
EXT. STREET Ñ MORNING 
The Brown Van accelerates fast away from the curb. 
INT. BROWN VAN Ñ MORNING 
His body crushing hers, Meeks kisses Atwood's cheek. 
MEEKS Surprise, surprise, Tracy. I told you I was coming back to get you. 
He frees his right hand and pulls his gun. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MEEKS I already know where I'm gonna hang you. But first I'm gonna watch her... (indicates the Driver) ... have some fun with you, then she's gonna watch me have some fun with you. 
He kisses her again and puts the gun to Atwood's head. 
MEEKS Now, don't move. 
He raises up and straddles her. 
MEEKS You know the drill, I'm gonna put the cuffs on. 
With his left hand he fishes a pair of handcuffs from a back pocket and snaps them on Atwood's right wrist. 
MEEKS Now the left. 
He rolls Atwood on her back and with the chain of the handcuff pulls her right arm toward her left. 
All Meeks' talk has allowed Atwood to catch her breath and suddenly she jerks her head up into the gun and screams at the top of her lungs. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD SHOOT ME!!! 
At the same time she pulls hard against the handcuff with her right wrist. A startled Meeks is thrown off balance. The gun comes away from Atwood's head. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD None of these is the woman in the van. 
DOCTOR Whoa... I'm sewing up your head here. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD Sorry. 
CAPTAIN LISTER And your ego can handle that? 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD It doesn't like any of the other choices. 
CAPTAIN LISTER Until Meeks is caught, Snyder is with you. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD Nothing personal, Snyder. (to Lister) He's not part of our team. 
CAPTAIN LISTER He's there to protect you. And listen to him, he's been alive longer than you have. 
SNYDER I didn't volunteer for this, Atwood. 
CAPTAIN LISTER The Parking Lot has a security camera. We're checking the tape. If Meeks and the Woman left in a car we'll have a license number. You have two days then I want a progress report on your divorce. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD I think I have all the pieces on the Thumbprint Killer, I'm just not looking at them the right way. 
CAPTAIN LISTER Okay, you have three days. 
She leaves. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD (smiles sweetly at Snyder) Every babysitter I ever had loved me. 
EXT. DRUG STORE PARKING LOT Ñ NIGHT 
In the scattering of vehicles Mr. Brooks' Toyota is hidden in plain sight in a row of cars. 
INT. TOYOTA Ñ NIGHT 
Behind the wheel, Mr. Brooks is again wearing his Pottery- Throwing clothes. Mr. Smith is in the passenger seat and Marshall is leaning forward from the back. 
They're all focused to varying degrees on the Entrance to the store. Mr. Smith raises his watch for a look at the time. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MR. SMITH Maybe he went home with someone else. 
MR. BROOKS Can you still see his pickup? 
Mr. Smith looks. 
MR. SMITH Uh huh. 
MR. BROOKS This is not the kind of guy who leaves his pickup in an unguarded Lot overnight. 
The silence returns. 
All three Men idly observe an old green Pontiac convertible with a frayed top and paint peeling, come into the Lot and park two spaces away facing them. We saw this car last watching Atwood from outside the Murder House. 
The headlights go off. 
The Driver's door opens. The Woman who was with Meeks in the Van steps out and hurries toward the Drug Store. 
She of course means nothing to Mr. Brooks but in the brief seconds the domelight is on, he catches sight of the Man in the passenger seat. A memory tickles his brain. 
He turns to Marshall. 
MR. BROOKS Where do we know that guy from? 
MARSHALL You really should pay more attention to what you read, Earl. 
MR. BROOKS That's what I have you for, Marshall. 
MARSHALL His picture was on the front page of the paper a couple days ago because he escaped from jail. He's the killer they call the Hangman. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
MR. BROOKS Ahh... 
MARSHALL Remember that cop you like, Atwood, who's chasing us, she's the one who put him away. I think his name is Thorton Meeks. 
Mr. Brooks cocks his head at the vague outline of Meeks. 
MR. BROOKS Well, well, well... What would life be without surprises? 
Mr. Smith who, remember, cannot hear or see Marshall, straightens up. 
MR. SMITH There he is! 
The Man they are waiting for is coming down the steps of the store. On the way to his Pickup he takes off a Manager's smock. 
MR. SMITH You know what's weird? I'll bet he has all these plans of what he's going to do tonight and tomorrow and he doesn't know he will already be dead and won't be able to do any of them. 
Mr. Brooks nods absently. The Drug Store Manager arrives at his truck. 
MR. BROOKS I don't think I want to kill this guy. 
Mr. Brooks steps out of the Toyota onto a sheet of plastic. Two strides away is an industrial vacuum cleaner. 
INT. TOYOTA Ñ NIGHT 
Mr. Brooks vacuums the passenger seat and dash and floor and everything around it. 
INT. GARAGE Ñ CERAMICS STUDIO - NIGHT 
Mr. Brooks removes his shoes and leaves them on the plastic, then slips his feet into paper slippers. 
With handiwipes he wipes down the outside of the passenger door, in fact anything on that side Mr. Smith could have touched. 
He opens the door and wipes down the seat and the dash and the console. 
Back on the plastic, Mr. Brooks undresses. On top of his clothes he drops the used handiwipes, the slippers and the vacuum bag. 
The corners of the plastic sheet are folded up, twisted together and Zip-tied to create a nice neat package which Mr. Brooks picks up and takes into the Ceramics Studio. 
INT. SHOWER - CERAMICS STUDIO Ñ NIGHT 
Mr. Brooks rinses off the lather under the spray. 
INT. CERAMICS STUDIO Ñ NIGHT 
The glow from 3000 degrees Fahrenheit is coming through the window of the kiln. 
INT. OFFICE - CERAMICS STUDIO Ñ NIGHT 
The Driver's license, complete with picture, of the Woman who was with Meeks in the Drug Store parking lot, is up on the computer screen. 
Mr. Brooks, now back in his regular clothes, brings the cursor down to the address. He scores this and drags it into Yahoo Maps 'driving directions'. 
A route is generated. Mr. Brooks brings the cursor up to 'Print' and clicks. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
CLOSE on his Printer. The map is fed out and settles into the tray. 
EXT. BROOKS HOUSE Ñ MORNING 
An unmarked Police car stops on the gravel of the Turn- Around. Two Plainclothes DETECTIVES get out and walk to the front door. 
The taller One rings the bell and they wait and then the door is opened by Mr. Brooks. 
In a flash he takes in the car and the way the Men are dressed and although his face doesn't betray it, he knows what they are. 
MR. BROOKS Hi, what can I do for you? 
The shorter One holds up a badge. 
DETECTIVE 1 I'm Detective Smolny with the Chicago Police and this is Detective Carfagno, from Palo Alto, California... 
CARFAGNO (DETECTIVE 2) (showing his badge) We'd like to speak to Jane Brooks, if that's possible. 
MR. BROOKS Jane is my daughter, what's this about? 
CARFAGNO There was a murder at Stanford not long before she left. She may be able to help us. 
MR. BROOKS Is she a suspect? 
CARFAGNO Not at this time. We simply would like to ask her some questions. 
SMOLNY (DETECTIVE 1) Is your daughter here? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MR. BROOKS Yes... she is. 
CARFAGNO The questions won't take long. 
MR. BROOKS I'm sure you would have no objection if she had an attorney present. 
SMOLNY That's fine. (reaching into his pocket) Here's my card. We can schedule a time for later today or tomorrow for her to come in to see us. 
Mr. Brooks looks at the card. 
MR. BROOKS If you gentlemen can wait, I will call my lawyer right now and see what we can work out. 
SMOLNY Oh, that's even better. 
MR. BROOKS (opening the door wider) Would you like some coffee? 
SMOLNY Thank you. 
INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY Ñ BROOKS HOUSE - MORNING 
Marshall is walking alongside a very disturbed Mr. Brooks. 
MARSHALL We both knew she was hiding something bigger, I certainly didn't think it was this big. 
MR. BROOKS She's not a suspect, Marshall. She may not have anything to do with it at all. 
Mr. Brooks opens a door. The room that is revealed is a very well equipped home GYM. 
(CONTINUED) 
MR. BROOKS (V.O.) - time - tomorrow - 
Turns the page. 
MR. BROOKS - night - Don't - be - stupid -. 
Mr. Smith refolds the Newspaper and throws it at the passenger seat. 
MR. SMITH Fuck you! 
He inserts the key into the ignition. 
RAP-RAP!! There's a sudden sharp KNOCK!!, on the Driver's window. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Mr. Smith levitates off the seat!! Unable to breathe, he turns. 
Detective Atwood's face lowers into view. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD You remember me? 
All Mr. Smith can do is nod. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD Would you step out of the car, please, I want to talk to you. 
EXT. CAR Ñ DAY 
Atwood steps back as Mr. Smith gets out. Behind her, Detective Snyder is standing next to the Driver's door of an un-marked Police car which has blocked Mr. Smith in. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD So Mr. Baffert, what is that you have to tell me? 
MR. SMITH What do you mean? I don't have anything to tell you. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD Really? Because I was driving around and I got this sudden feeling that you had something to tell me about the murders. 
MR. SMITH No. Nothing. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD That's disappointing. Because when I left you the last time we talked, I felt I had missed a clue that was right in front of me that would solve this whole case. 
MR. SMITH I don't know why you would feel that. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD Didn't you tell me you were an amateur potter, that you made bowls and vases? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MR. SMITH No, I said I was an amateur photographer. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD Are you positive? Because we found potter's clay on the carpet of the murder house and I was sure you said to me that you worked with clay, that you made pots. 
MR. SMITH No. I said my hobby was photography, not pottery. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD Maybe that was it. The Stewardess upstairs said the victims kept their curtains open when they made love. Could I see some of the pictures you took of that Couple? 
Mr. Smith can only stare at Detective Atwood. His Adam's apple moves up and down though he makes no sound. Should he or shouldn't he? 
Finally he throws his arms up in a shrug but in his half-turn of indecision he happens to spy the Newspaper he tossed at the passenger seat of his car. 
Part of it is draped over the console. The red circles around the words on that page jump out at him. 
MR. BROOKS (V.O.) Don't - be - stupid -. 
Mr. Smith returns his attention to Detective Atwood. 
MR. SMITH You are harassing me, Detective Atwood. You know very well I'm not a potter and I don't have any pictures! So my feeling is that your feeling is wrong and that you should move your car and let me go home. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD What is your job here? What do you do? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
MR. SMITH I'm a mechanical engineer. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD You have to be pretty smart for that, don't you? 
MR. SMITH I guess. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD Then be smart, Mr. Baffert. You lied to me right there at the end. I'll be watching you. And when you want to tell me the truth, you know how to get in touch with me. 
She gives him a dazzling smile. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD See you later, alligator. 
Atwood walks back to her car and gets in. 
INT. UNMARKED POLICE CAR Ñ DAY 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD (under her breath) Goddamit... 
As Snyder accelerates away he points to the car's computer screen. 
SNYDER Captain Lister got us the search warrant for Meeks' Chiropractor. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD Good. (shakes her head 'no', frustrated) Goddamit!, that guy knows something... (meaning Mr. Smith) He almost told me and then something happened. 
A light and footsteps hurry toward her from the LIVING ROOM. Atwood swings her light at them. 
SNYDER Hey! 
He squints and turns away. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD I thought you were behind me. 
SNYDER The living room is clean. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
Atwood swings her light back onto the dead Woman. The combined illumination of the flashlights cause the support joists twelve feet up to throw eerie shadows onto the open ceiling. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD Snyder, meet Mona. 
The Uniformed Policeman comes up beside Atwood. 
UNIFORMED POLICEMAN I called it in. 
The smell of blood and the sight of the carnage is too much for him. His gorge rises and he gags. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD Do that outside. 
The Officer doesn't have to be told twice. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD (to Snyder, re: the body) Meeks did this. 
SNYDER I thought Meeks hung people. 
Atwood retraces her steps in the Kitchen. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD Meeks is a steroid freak. This Refrigerator was always full of steroids. Mona was Alvin Griffin's niece, receptionist, lover and keeper of the keys. 
She focuses her flashlight on an open padlock dangling from a steel band that runs around the Refrigerator. With the barrel of the Glock she opens the door. 
The only edibles inside are a tomato, half a loaf of bread, a package of hotdogs and some part of a chicken in a KFC box. The rest of the space is vacant. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD Well, the steroids are certainly gone. 
SNYDER You think Meeks has Alvin with him? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD Meeks thinks Alvin turned him in. 
She shuts the Refrigerator. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD Let's go see what's in the rest of the house. 
CUT TO: 
Atwood and her flashlight pass us. Three feet to her right and slightly behind is Snyder and his flashlight. 
The two Detectives are leaving the Living Room and entering the HALL toward the bedrooms. The ceiling is low here and it feels very claustrophobic. 
Ahead is a Door painted red. 
But before they get to it, there's a Room on the right. Snyder shines his light in. 
It's a BATHROOM. The shower curtain is open. Nobody in the tub. 
The Door ahead is waiting, but there's another Door on the right. Snyder shines his light in. 
This one is a Treatment Room with a Therapy table and shelves of oils and unguents. 
They've come to the red Door. Atwood will open this one. 
She turns the knob and pushes. The Door is stuck. She and Snyder exchange a look. 
Snyder shuffles back half a step and flattens himself against the wall. He shuts off his flashlight. 
Atwood takes a deep breath, levers her weight against the door and pushes. 
There's a sudden Snap! Then the door swings freely open. The beam of Atwood's flashlight reveals a large room containing a bed, a dresser, a... 
CREEEKKK!!! The sound is coming from up in the rafters. Atwood whips her flashlight in that direction. 
For an instant the beam catches a piece of a large shape falling fast right at her. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (4) 
Then it's lost in the darkness and then picked up again in the reflected light in the Hall. The shape is a naked Man. 
WHACK!! The Man nails Atwood in the shoulder. BANG! Her gun goes off. She bounces into the wall and onto her ass. 
Barely slowed the Man continues in an upward arc. His feet and knees slam into the ceiling. Plaster dust rains. 
The Man swings back, past Snyder. He's lost in the darkness again. Then he swings back into the light and comes to a stop just inside the bedroom Door. 
The Man is hanging from a rope around his neck. He's dead. His Body is festooned with syringes stuck into his bare flesh. 
In fact two of the needles hold a sheet of paper to the Man's chest. Printed on the paper in big black letters are the words: 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD Yes? 
INT. LAW OFFICES Ñ MORNING 
The Asian Attorney interrupts her sip of coffee. 
ASIAN ATTORNEY Hi Tracy, this is Nancy Tang. We received a counter offer. Are you sitting down? 
INT. DEN - DETECTIVE ATWOOD'S CONDOMINIUM Ñ MORNING 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD Yeah, go ahead... He can't get that, can he?! 
INTERCUT with Nancy. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
NANCY (ASIAN ATTORNEY) No, my sense of it is by asking for five, they're hoping you'll settle anywhere between two five and three. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD Never. How long can you stall them? 
NANCY They know you want this done quickly, so they're going to expect a quick counter offer. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD I need two days. Wait two days before getting back to them. If they call, tell them it's a big number, I'm thinking about it. 
NANCY Okay. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD And the picture he wanted... 
She slams the frame of Jesse's photo against the inside of a metal trash can. 
Nancy winces and then smiles at the sound of shattering glass. 
Atwood plucks the photo out of the frame and tears it so that the rip can be heard over the phone. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD ... tell him I couldn't find it. 
INT. MASTER BEDROOM - BROOKS HOUSE Ñ MORNING 
Mr. Brooks is still asleep. Emma, dressed for the day, arrives at his side of the bed. She rubs the back of Mr. Brooks' hand. 
EMMA Earl... Earl... 
Mr. Brooks opens his eyes. 
MR. BROOKS (sleepy, groggy) Huh?... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
EMMA Roger is on the phone. 
INT. KITCHEN Ñ BROOKS HOUSE - MORNING 
In his slippers and robe, Mr. Brooks is standing in the Doorway watching Jane who is leaning over the Counter with an open Newspaper next to a bowl of cereal. 
He has a chance to take a good long look before she feels his presence and raises her head. 
JANE Oh, Hi, Daddy, I thought you'd already be gone. 
MR. BROOKS Roger called. There was another murder last night near Stanford. 
JANE Oh... 
MR. BROOKS Done the same way as the one they talked to you about. Right down to the hatchet being left at the scene. 
Jane can't quite conceal the tremor of surprise that ripples through her and Mr. Brooks sees it. 
MR. BROOKS They think they have a serial killer. Obviously you were here last night, so you're in the clear. 
JANE That's good news, isn't it? I mean even if you're innocent it's good news to know you're not a suspect. 
MR. BROOKS Oh, yeah. How's the morning sickness? Do you want to ride in with me today? 
JANE I feel fine, but I don't know how long that will last. 
Mr. Brooks nods, turns to leave, then turns back. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MR. BROOKS Do you love me, Jane? 
JANE Of course I love you, daddy, you're my father. 
MR. BROOKS Have you decided whether or not to keep the baby? 
JANE Not yet. 
MR. BROOKS (nods) Okay. 
EXT. MR. SMITH'S CAR Ñ AFTERNOON 
Looking off the grill as it overtakes another car in the Fastlane. 
Eminem is on the stereo. The car ahead moves out of the way. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD This is my case, what you're doing is fucked. But since I can't stop you, and she won't, here's a tip. James Baffert, you should stake him out, he knows something. 
DETECTIVE LONGNECKER We have some other ideas we are looking into. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD Then what's the problem? You do that and I'll tail Baffert. 
DETECTIVE LONGNECKER Thank you for all your good work, Detective. This is our case now. 
Atwood looks from one Man to the Other. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD Good luck. (to Captain Lister) Later I suppose you'll fill me in on what I'm supposed to be doing around here. I'm confused. 
She leaves. Snyder closes the door behind her. 
INT. RECEPTION AREA - BROOKS BOX FACTORY - LATE EVENING 
It's deserted with only a small spill of light coming from Mr. Brooks' Office. 
INSIDE 
Mr. Brooks is at his desk. 
The lamp at his elbow throws a yellow cone across his face. His head is in his hands, he's been crying. 
Marshall steps out of the shadows behind him. 
MARSHALL It's time to go. 
MR. BROOKS Yeah. 
He reaches into a bottom drawer and as he takes out an envelope, Marshall reads the tear-stained hand written letter resting on the blotter. 
MARSHALL Dear Emma and Jane, my loves, I have a terminal illness and instead of subjecting you to my deterioration, I have decided to disappear. Don't try to find me, I don't want to be found. Please believe that the time I spent with you brought me the greatest joy of my life. Love. Dad. 
Mr. Brooks picks up the letter and folds it. 
MARSHALL So you're going to go through with it. 
Mr. Brooks stuffs the letter in the envelope, seals it and picks up a pen. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MR. BROOKS It's all planned to work out, Marshall. 
On the envelope he writes: For EMMA and JANE. 
EXT. STREET Ñ NIGHT 
On the sidewalk Mr. Smith is walking toward the on-coming traffic. The headlights make it difficult to tell one car from the other until they pass. That doesn't keep him from looking for Mr. Brooks. 
The houses stop and he's passing a pocket park. In a dark space between the street lamps, a hand falls on Mr. Smith's shoulder. He jumps and a scream squeaks out of his throat. It's Mr. Brooks, in his Pottery-Throwing clothes. 
MR. BROOKS (smiles) Are you ready to rock and roll, Mr. Smith? 
Mr. Smith swallows hard and nods. Mr. Brooks propels him into the park. 
INT. MR. BROOKS' CAR Ñ NIGHT 
Mr. Brooks is driving. Mr. Smith is in the passenger seat. Both are lost in a wary silence. Abruptly from the back seat: 
MARSHALL I smell gun oil, a gun oil that's different than yours. 
MR. BROOKS He brought his gun. After he gets what he wants he plans to kill me. 
MARSHALL Ah... now I get it. You were counting on that, weren't you? 
MR. BROOKS It has a certain logic. 
MARSHALL But if your plan is to have him kill you, why do you have to kill someone else first? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MR. BROOKS He'll need to see that to get up the courage to kill me. 
Marshall roars with laughter. 
MARSHALL Not even you believe that, Earl. It makes it more exciting, doesn't it, to think he's going to kill you after you kill someone else. You're getting your rocks off big time, that's why you're doing it. 
MR. BROOKS Not true... and if it were, so what? (to Mr. Smith) You're goddamn great, you know. To have the balls to do this. 
MR. SMITH I'm pretty nervous but that's normal right? 
MR. BROOKS Perfectly normal. 
INT. DETECTIVE ATWOOD'S CONDOMINIUM Ñ NIGHT 
Atwood is propped up in bed reading a Magazine. Her hair is pulled back and her face glistens with Cold Cream. 
The phone rings. Should she answer it? It rings again, then again. Reluctantly she grabs the receiver. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD Hello... Oh, yes, yes. (she sits up) Put him through... Hi, this is Detective Atwood speaking, thanks for calling...Yes, your roommate said you were in Tokyo... Anything, if you saw anything at all it might be helpful. 
Sheila gives him a quick kiss and moves on into the LIVING ROOM where she drops her briefcase on the couch. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
SHEILA If we go to court, best case, two, if she wants to settle, best case, three, but I would be happy with two seven. 
Backlit by the Fireplace, Jesse kisses her again. 
From the KITCHEN, Mr. Brooks and Mr. Smith watch Jesse unzip Sheila's slacks and dropping to his knees peel them off her legs. 
She steps out of them. He kisses the inside of her thighs, her crotch, then standing up: 
JESSE I'll be right back. 
On his way out of the LIVING ROOM: 
JESSE I think we should hold firm for three. 
He shuts off the light. In the glow of the Fireplace, Sheila removes her jacket. 
SHEILA Let's not be piggish, two five, two seven, would be a good deal. 
The T.V. goes silent. Jesse returns with a partially full glass of Champagne. 
He hands Sheila a glass from a side table, takes a bottle out of an ice bucket and as he fills her glass: 
SHEILA (teasing) You've already had half a bottle. 
JESSE You're late; if we want it, there's more. 
They clink glasses. 
SHEILA To us. 
JESSE To three million dollars. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) 
SHEILA (after a sip) We have to do this fast because remember, Marie is meeting us here. 
JESSE We could ask her to join us. 
SHEILA Not funny. 
JESSE (undoing the front of her bra) I wasn't trying to be. 
She bops him playfully. He bends and slips a nipple into his mouth. Sheila bites her lip and moans. 
In the KITCHEN, Mr. Smith shifts around for a better view. The floor under him CRREEEKKS! 
In the LIVING ROOM, both Sheila and Jesse react to the sound. 
SHEILA Are we alone? 
JESSE Yeah. 
Mr. Brooks seems to appear magically out of the darkened Kitchen with his gun raised. He's followed by Mr. Smith. Sheila opens her mouth to scream. 
MR. BROOKS Don't do that. 
INT. MR. SMITH'S APARTMENT BUILDING Ñ NIGHT 
Detective Atwood hurries down the HALL and out of breath, stops in front of Mr. Smith's door. She raps sharply. Waits a bare three seconds and raps again. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD Mr. Baffert?... Mr. Baffert? 
The door of the Apartment behind her opens and an OLDER WOMAN sticks her head out. 
OLDER WOMAN He's gone. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Atwood shows her badge. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD Do you have any idea when he'll be back? 
OLDER WOMAN He skipped out. I heard him leave this evening and a few minutes later there were Movers here. Musta been behind on the rent. He didn't even say good-bye. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD Thank you. 
As the Old Lady watches, Atwood tries the knob. It's unlocked. She pushes the door open. 
The HALLWAY and LIVING ROOM she can see are completely empty. Furniture, T.V., camera equipment, art, gone. 
OLDER WOMAN I told you. 
INT. MR. SMITH'S APARTMENT Ñ NIGHT 
On her way in, Atwood draws her gun. 
Keeping close to the walls she audits the KITCHEN. All the Cabinet doors are open. Dishes, pots and pans, cutlery, gone. 
She moves on to the BATHROOM. Soap, shampoo, toilet paper, toothpaste, toothbrushes, towels, washcloths, the contents of the Medicine Cabinet, gone. 
CONTINUED: 
MR. SMITH Not now. Take the next off ramp. 
MR. BROOKS That wouldn't be very smart of me would it? 
He accelerates around a truck into the Fastlane. Mr. Smith can see the Exit coming up, it's quickly left behind. 
MR. BROOKS (matter of fact) Think about this. You pissed yourself back there, you left your DNA at the scene of a double homicide, and there's nothing to indicate that I was ever there. If the Cops do an analysis of that urine, and they will, you're the Thumbprint Killer. 
MR. SMITH (smug) No. I still have pictures of you doing the first murder. 
Mr. Brooks smiles a knowing smile. Beyond him on the other side of the Divider, cars are zipping by in the opposite direction. 
MR. BROOKS Yes. But what were you doing at the second murder? 
Mr. Smith doesn't have an answer for that. 
MR. BROOKS Let me help you with a thought. You say I forced you to come along and if I'm not here or more specifically my body is not here to say different, you might have a chance to beat the rap. Now you're probably asking yourself why I would help you. I'm tired, Mr. Smith, I'm tired of killing. But I'm an addict, I can't quit. I've tried. I can't do it on my own. So I'll let you kill me but I want you to do it smart, in a way that I disappear and my family never knows what I was. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
MR. SMITH How do I do that? 
MR. BROOKS There's a cemetery I know about. We find an open grave, you shoot me, I fall in the grave, you shovel in just enough earth to cover me, tomorrow a casket is lowered onto me and I've disappeared. It's a good plan. What do you say?... 
MR. SMITH Why should I trust you? 
MR. BROOKS You don't have to trust me. You're the man holding the gun, you saw me put mine in the trunk. 
MR. SMITH I don't know. You really want me to kill you? 
MR. BROOKS Yes. 
MR. SMITH Okay... But any sudden moves and you're dead on the spot and I'll make sure your family knows what you are. 
MR. BROOKS I understand. 
EXT. OLD DECO BUILDING Ñ NIGHT 
Come off the banner hanging across the front - ROOMS FOR RENT, to find Atwood walking away from her car. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD (to herself, regarding the Building) You've come down in the world, Mr. Baffert. 
INT. LOBBY - OLD DECO BUILDING Ñ NIGHT 
High ceilings, once grand, now blue neon and a cage around the Front Desk to protect the Night Clerk who is nowhere in sight. Somewhere a radio is playing salsa music loud. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Atwood crosses to the elevator. She pushes the call button. With an arthritic rattle the door opens. 
INT. ELEVATOR Ñ NIGHT 
Atwood selects the 5th Floor. Creek!, Clatter!, Clank!, the door closes and after a stuttering liftoff the car begins its ascent. The overhead light flickers on and off. Atwood looks up at it. 
EXT. SIDEWALK Ñ NIGHT 
Mr. Brooks leads Mr. Smith across a street to a pedestrian gate set in a high wall. 
Through the bars of the gate we can see a Cemetery bathed in moonlight. 
Mr. Brooks reaches into his pocket. Mr. Smith tightens his grip on the gun. 
MR. SMITH Uh uh, take your hand out real slow. 
Mr. Brooks does as he's told. A key dangles from his fingers. 
MR. BROOKS It's locked. You don't want to climb over, do you? 
MR. SMITH What are you doing with a key to a cemetery? 
MR. BROOKS I own it. 
MR. SMITH Why do you own a cemetery? 
Mr. Brooks unlocks the gate and preceding Mr. Smith, goes inside. 
MR. BROOKS You always want to invest in things people can't do without. Water and cemeteries are pretty safe. 
He locks the gate and handing the key to Mr. Smith:

MR. BROOKS You'll need this to get out. Now there should be an open grave around here somewhere. Let's see if we can find it. 
He produces a small flashlight from his pocket and off they go. 
INT. OLD DECO BUILDING Ñ NIGHT 
Repeating their arthritic performance the elevator doors open. Atwood steps out into a wide sporadically lit HALLWAY. 
Peering at the numbers Atwood goes to her Left. 
MR. BROOKS Okay, let's get this over with. 
Mr. Smith raises his gun and points it at Mr. Brooks's head. He hesitates. 
MR. BROOKS I'll close my eyes. 
He does. Mr. Smith pulls the trigger. 
Click! 
Mr. Smith looks in horror at the malfunctioning gun. Mr. Brooks opens his eyes. Mr. Smith aims the gun again. 
Click!... Click! 
MR. BROOKS I'm sorry. 
As he talks he counters around until Mr. Smith is the one with his back to the open Grave. 
MR. BROOKS I really did want you to kill me. But in case at the last minute I changed my mind, I returned to your apartment and bent the firing pin on your gun. 
He wrenches the shovel out of a mound of waiting earth. Mr. Smith tries to fire the gun at Mr. Brooks again. 
CLICK!... CLICK! 
MR. BROOKS In fact I even brought another gun for you so you could finish me if I had decided to go through with it. 
He opens his jacket and shows Mr. Smith the gun. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
MR. BROOKS Unfortunately for you, my daughter is pregnant and just before you pulled the trigger, I realized how much I want to see the end to that story. 
MR. SMITH (dry mouth) If you do anything to me, if you touch one hair on my head, the Police will find the pictures of you killing that Couple. 
MR. BROOKS The contents of your safety deposit box, Mr. Smith, have vanished. 
Without warning, Mr. Brooks swings the shovel. The force of the blow breaks Mr. Smith's left arm. He howls. 
The next blow comes almost immediately. It smashes into the left side of Mr. Smith's head. 
The screams stop and a misfiring set of neurons causes Mr. Smith to stand up straight and wobbling, look directly at Mr. Brooks. 
The blood streaming down his face is black in the moonlight. 
Mr. Brooks takes a step to the side, cocks his wrists and swings again. His full weight is behind this one. 
The blade of the shovel strikes Mr. Smith in the throat very nearly taking off his head. The flesh that was once Mr. Smith falls to the ground. 
MR. BROOKS (looking down at the corpse) Before I was the Thumbprint Killer, Mr. Smith, I killed a lot of people in a lot of different ways. 
INT. GRAVE Ñ NIGHT 
Looking up. Mr. Smith's body is rolled over the edge. It falls on top of us. 
EXT. CEMETERY Ñ NIGHT 
Mr. Brooks takes a shovel of dirt from the pile and whistling 'By The Light Of The Silvery Moon', begins the task of covering Mr. Smith. 
INT. COFFEE SHOP Ñ MORNING 
A Newspaper is lying unfolded on the Counter next to the remnants of a breakfast. 
The headline reads - NATIONWIDE MANHUNT FOR THUMBPRINT KILLER - Under that headline is a large picture of Mr. Smith aka Mr. Baffert. 
In the lower right corner is another headline to a story - Murder Suicide For The Hangman -. 
The reader of the paper is Mr. Brooks. On a stool next to him, Marshall is also reading. 
MARSHALL It says here the Thumbprint Killer is a monster... annoys you a little bit that you can't take credit, doesn't it? 
MR. BROOKS Anyone who is good at what they do, wants recognition. But since I'm not going to do it anymore, I'll let Mr. Smith take the credit. 
MARSHALL Don't kid yourself, Earl, you're going to kill again. 
MR. BROOKS No, I'm not. I'll continue the AA meetings and I'll control it. 
On the other stool next to Mr. Brooks is a WOMAN. Her large purse hangs open from the back of the stool; the cel phone clearly visible inside. Mr. Brooks looks at the phone. 
MR. BROOKS But there is an answer I would like to have. 
INT. POLICE STATION Ñ MORNING 
Detective Atwood is seated in her CUBICLE reading the same front page Mr. Brooks was reading. A FELLOW OFFICER stops in the door. 
OFFICER Good work, Atwood. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD Thanks, Tom. 
He moves on. From off screen: 
ANOTHER OFFICER You should ask the FBI to kiss your ass and buy you a Cadillac. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD I like my ass too much for that. 
Snyder comes in and holds up the Work Order from the Moving Company. 
SNYDER This is bogus. The company doesn't exist in the city, the state, the United States or Canada.

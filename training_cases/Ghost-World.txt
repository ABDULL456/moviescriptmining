Todd, forgotten, walks away. The singer wails a sappy, maudlin ballad. Enid spots DENNIS, the class loser, wandering around by himself. 
ENID God, just think, we'll never see Dennis again. 
REBECCA Good. 
ENID God, think about that... that's actually totally depressing. 
INT. THE QUALITY CAFE - DAY 
The QUALITY CAFE is Enid and Rebecca' s hangout. A 50-ISH MAN with shaved head, and his VAGUELY DIABOLICAL WIFE sit eating lunch. Enid is drawing a picture of them in her sketchbook when Rebecca arrives. 
REBECCA Hi. 
ENID Look at these people behind you. I'm totally convinced they're Satanists. 
REBECCA Why? 
ENID Just look at them! 
REBECCA turns and makes eye contact with MR. SATANIST. She calmly turns back to face Enid before cracking up. 
REBECCA So, when are we going to start looking for our apartment? 
ENID Soon... I have to wait and see how this Summer class goes. 
REBECCA Did you sign up yet? 
ENID Yeah, I just picked the one that sounded the easiest. 
REBECCA God, it's so weird that we're finally out of high school... We've been waiting for this our whole life! Now we can get our own apartment and do anything we want.  It's such a weird feeling. 
ENID I know, it hasn't really hit me yet. 
Enter JOHN ELLIS, an obnoxious young man with a perpetual smirk. 
JOHN Well, if it isn't Enid and Rebecca, the little Jewish girl and her Aryan friend. 
ENID You're late, asshole. 
JOHN Fine, and how are you? 
ENID Did you bring that tape? 
He puts a videotape on the table, just out of reach. 
JOHN You never paid me for that tape with the Indian dance routine. 
ENID I did too! 
JOHN Tsk! You Jews are so clever with money... 
ENID Fuck you, you stupid redneck hick! 
REBECCA Hey, look, the satanists are leaving! 
ENID We should follow them! 
As the SATANISTS walk outside, they open umbrellas, even though it's a bright, sunny day. 
REBECCA Totally... Oh my God, look! 
The girls get up to follow them. Enid grabs the videotape. 
ENID (to John) Thanks for the tape - I'll have to pay you later, I'm broke. 
JOHN Hey, where are you going? 
ENID Later, "Dude". 
REBECCA Much later. 
ENID In fact, never. 
EXT. QUALITY CAFE - DAY 
Under harsh, glaring sunshine, the girls follow a half-block behind the SATANISTS. 
REBECCA What do you do if you're a satanist, anyway? 
ENID You know, sacrifice virgins and stuff... 
REBECCA That lets us off the hook. 
EXT. ACROSS FROM WOWSVILLE - TEN MINUTES HAVE PASSED 
REBECCA We should call him and pretend to be the redhead. 
ENID Oh, we totally have to. 
Enid tears out the ad and puts it in her sketchbook. 
CU of sketchbook. 
INT. OOMIE'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING 
Enid and Rebecca sit with Rebecca's grandmother OOMIE in her living room. They eat TV dinners while watching Oomie's favorite TV SHOW, which we hear but don't see. 
NASAL-VOICED GIRL (V.O.) So what happened next, Donna? 
DONNA (DUMB BLONDE'S V.O.) Then I told him he'd better take out his hose and pump me! 
NASAL-VOICED GIRL/ANOTHER GIRL (V.O.) Don-na?! 
DONNA (V.O.) You guys! My car was out of gas! 
LAUGH TRACK. Enid leans toward Rebecca. 
ENID (whispers) Does Oomie really like this show? 
REBECCA (whispers) Isn't it weird? It's her favorite. 
OOMIE Girls! Shh! 
Enid and Rebecca exit. 
INT. REBECCA'S ROOM - EVENING 
Rebecca looks through Enid's sketchbook while Enid fiddles with the remote, fast-forwarding through a tape in the VCR. 
REBECCA So what should we do? 
ENID Wait... I just want to see what's on this tape. 
REBECCA What is this? 
ENID I dunno. John Ellis always puts on all this sick stuff that I have to fast-forward past to get to the good stuff.  There's supposed to be a Don Knotts movie on here someplace. 
Sound of FAST-FORWARDING. Rebecca glances up from the sketchbook. 
REBECCA Wait, what is that? 
Enid stops fast-forwarding. We don't see the screen but we hear weird sounds like BOOTS WALKING THROUGH DEEP MUD. 
ENID & REBECCA EEEEWWWW! 
Enid lurches forward to avert her gaze. She clicks off the VCR, but leaves the TV on. She notices a PHOTO ALBUM on a bookshelf under the television. 
ENID Hey - why do you have this? 
REBECCA You lent it to me in like tenth grade. 
ENID I've been looking all over for this. 
ANGLE ON ALBUM as she leafs through it. We see a picture of a FIVE-YEAR-OLD ENID with glasses. 
ENID Look at how cute I am! 
REBECCA What a little hosebag. 
ANGLE ON PHOTO of ELEVEN-YEAR-OLD ENID & REBECCA at a party. 
ENID Look, that's back when I hated you. 
REBECCA I remember every minute of that party. 
ENID (another page) There's my dad with Joanie. 
REBECCA I can never keep them all straight - was she the super-bitch? 
ENID No, she was the second wife. The third one was the super-bitch - Maxine. (finds a picture) There! Look at her! 
ANGLE ON PHOTO of MAXINE. 
ENID What a fucking monster! 
Something on TV catches Rebecca's eye. 
REBECCA Oh my God! This is that comedian I was telling you about! You have to see this guy -- he's the absolute worst! 
A dead-pan comedian, JOEY McCOBB, is doing his stand-up routine in a standard brick-wall comedy venue. He has a contrived "I'm a weirdo" shtick. 
BOSS Hey! I told you: No shirt, no service! 
DOUG (as he leaves) Fuck you, man! 
ENID So Josh... 
JOSH Look, can we talk in a minute? I'm almost done. 
Enid looks at herself in the security mirror. She takes off her hat and messes up her hair. She then takes off her shades and replaces them with her standard horn-rims. 
REBECCA (nudging Enid, points outside) Look at this! 
Outside we see Doug practicing with nunchuks and drinking a beer. Heavy metal music blares from his car radio. The BOSS sees this and goes out to yell at him. 
BOSS You get out of here! 
Josh joins Enid & Rebecca on the other side of counter. 
ENID That guy rules! 
JOSH Who, Doug? He spends more time here than I do... 
ENID So Josh, will you give us a ride? Please? Pretty please? It's going to be super fun! 
JOSH No. 
REBECCA Please Josh? 
JOSH Forget it, there's no way... find some other poor sucker to abuse. 
EXT. JOSH'S CAR - DAY 
Josh is driving, chauffeur-like, with the two girls relaxing in the back seat. 
JOSH Why do you even need a ride? You could walk there in two minutes. 
ENID It's just an excuse for us to spend time with you. 
Enid and Rebecca giggle. 
REBECCA So Josh, if this guy freaks out, will you protect us? 
JOSH He has every reason to freak out -- this is a totally fucked-up thing to do to somebody! 
ENID God, I think Josh is too mature for us. 
REBECCA I know, look at the way he drives... he's like an old man. 
ENID Yeah, Josh, c'mon... MOVE IT! 
EXT. GAFFEY STREET - DAY 
Their car accelerates. 
INT. WOWSVILLE DINER - 12:35 PM. 
The three of them are seated at a corner booth. A song from any decade other than the 50's PLAYS on the jukebox. A BUSINESSMAN enters. 
REBECCA Look, maybe that's him! 
ENID It's still twenty-five minutes early. 
JOSH Aren't there a million places like this? 
ENID This is the ultimate. It's like the Taj Mahal of bad, fake 50's diners. 
JOSH So, where's "Weird Al"? 
ENID SHH! He's back there. I can see his hair bobbing up and down. 
REBECCA I want to "make love" to him. 
ENID I'm going to tell him you said that. 
WEIRD AL approaches with menus. 
AL So nice to see you again, ladies. 
ENID Hey, Weird Al, there's something my friend wants to tell you -- 
REBECCA SHUT UP! 
ENID She says she wants to MMPH! 
Rebecca puts her hand over Enid's mouth. 
ENID Oh my God, that's HIM! 
REBECCA Are you sure? 
ENID Totally! Look! 
ANGLE ON: SEYMOUR really having a fit now. Once it's out of his system, he reverts to an amiable poker-face. 
ENID He's insane! 
REBECCA We should follow him home. 
JOSH Forget it. 
ENID Come on, Josh... don't you want to see where he lives? 
JOSH No. 
ENID But this guy is like a one-of-kind, rare butterfly, and we have to follow him back to his natural habitat... 
JOSH You need counseling. 
EXT. SEYMOUR'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Several minutes have passed. Seymour parks. 
REBECCA God, he lives right in our neighborhood! 
Seymour gets out and disappears up the steps of his building. 
ENID He doesn't even look that bummed out, really. 
REBECCA I know... wouldn't you be totally pissed off? 
ENID This kind of thing must happen to him all the time. 
INT. EXPERIMENTAL FILM - DAY 
FULL SCREEN: grainy B&W video footage. The CAMERA travels up a shadowy flight of stairs. We hear FOOTSTEPS, a rhythmic POUNDING, and a deranged CHILDREN'S CHOIR ("LALALALALALA"). 
WOMAN'S VOICE (cheap echo effect) Returning to the house of my Fatherfatherfatherfather... 
The CAMERA reaches the top of the stairs, we see a door that slowly CREAKS open. We move into the room beyond, it's decorated with stuff from the 50's and a giant crucifix. We HEAR a televangelist's sermon. We MOVE CLOSE on a little girl's doll. Very slowly a MAN'S HAND reaches for the doll and drags it into the shadows. The hand throws the now mutilated doll into a toilet; water and blood swirl around. 
We see grainy footage (shot off of TV) of Christians angrily picketing an abortion clinic. CREDITS come up: THE END.  A FILM BY ROBERTA ALLSWORTH. 
INT. ART CLASS - DAY 
The lights go on, the VIDEO ends and the monitor is shut off. 
There are about a dozen students, mostly pimply 14-year-old boys, a few 14-ish girls, and Enid, dressed in schoolgirl outfit. The teacher, ROBERTA ALLSWORTH, addresses the class. 
ROBERTA That piece is entitled "Mirror/Father/Mirror." I like to show it to people I'm meeting for the first time because it says so much about who I am and what it feels like to inhabit my specific skin. And this is exactly what I'm hoping to get from each of you over the course of this Summer: a picture of your own self-exploration. My own background is in video and performance art, but I'm hoping that doesn't influence you and that you'll find your own ways of externalizing the internal. At the end of the Summer, this class has been invited, along with several others in the area, to participate in a show of High-School art at the Neighborhood Activity Center. The title of the show will be "Brotherhood and Community: Art as Dialogue." I think the "Brotherhood" theme ties in nicely with the theme of self-discovery that I'd like to emphasize in this class. Are there any questions so far? (she's completely lost them) Great... 
EXT. SEYMOUR'S NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY 
Enid and Rebecca stand in front of Seymour's apartment. 
ENID This is way too creepy. 
REBECCA He won't see us... we'll just stalk him from a distance. 
ENID I'm afraid if I see him, I'll start feeling really bad again. 
A pause. 
ENID So what should we do? We can't just hide all day waiting for him to come out... 
EXT. SEYMOUR'S BUILDING - MAILBOX 
There are three mail slots. Enid pulls the mail out of the first one. We see FLOWER BULB CATALOGUES, and LADIES HOME JOURNAL. 
ENID This is girl mail. 
She grabs the mail out of SLOT NUMBER TWO. 
ENID This is all computer catalogues and stuff... 
Rebecca is looking at the mail from SLOT NUMBER THREE. 
REBECCA The W.C. Fields Fan Club Newsletter... (she flips through the mail) Oh my God, The National Psoriasis Foundation! 
ENID Bingo! 
She shoves back the contents of slot number two and grabs the mail from Rebecca. We hear MALE VOICES around the corner. 
He pulls out a bland-looking record: "COLLECTOR'S ITEMS, VOLUME THREE." Rebecca shifts impatiently behind her. 
SEYMOUR This track alone by Memphis Minnie is worth about $500 if you have the original 78. She was one of the greatest guitar players that ever lived, and a great singer and songwriter as well. I know the guy who owns the original and lent it for use on this reissue. 
ENID Wow! 
Rebecca snorts at Enid's over-exuberance. Enid kicks her. 
ENID How much is it? 
SEYMOUR A dollar seventy-five. 
ENID Okay. 
She pays him. 
SEYMOUR If you don't like it bring it back for a refund. We're here every Saturday. 
He puts the record into a bag. 
ENID I'm sure it's fine. 
INT. QUALITY CAFE - DAY 
Enid & Rebecca sit in their usual booth. Rebecca is reading THE FREE WEEKLY. 
REBECCA That was truly pathetic. 
ENID I know... I still can't get over that his name was "Seymour." 
Rebecca starts looking through the APARTMENT LISTINGS. She takes a pen out of her purse. 
REBECCA He was so excited when you bought that record -- you're a saint!... God, these apartments are super expensive... 
ENID It was so cute how he had his own little bags. I thought I was going to start crying!... Do you think they're gay? 
REBECCA What about the "striking redhead in the yellow dress"? 
ENID Oh yeah... 
REBECCA He should totally just kill himself... Hey, here's one (circles it) ...Oh wait... (crosses it out) you have to share it with a non smoking feminist and her two cats... 
ENID I dunno... I kind of like him... He's the exact opposite of everything I really hate... In a way he's such a clueless dork that he's almost cool... 
REBECCA That guy is many things but he definitely isn't "cool"... This one would be okay, but there's no kitchen... 
ENID Yeah, but... you know what I mean. 
REBECCA Not really... 
ENID Forget it, I can't explain it... 
Awkward silence. Melorra enters. 
MELORRA Oh my god, what are you guys doing here? 
ENID What are you doing here, Melorra? 
MELORRA My acting workshop is across the street from here. I'm just on my break. 
ENID Well, we won't keep you. 
MELORRA I love this place... it's so - you know, "funky." 
Enid and Rebecca look at each other. 
MELORRA What are you guys up to? 
REBECCA We're looking for an apartment. 
MELORRA God how cool. Where are you moving? 
ENID We're not sure yet, that's why we're looking. 
REBECCA Somewhere downtown. 
MELORRA God that's so exciting! (looks at clock) Oops, I should go. Bye you guys! Call me. 
Melorra leaves quickly. 
REBECCA "Funky"? 
ENID What, is she black now? 
They watch her cross the street - she's dressed in expensive "casual" clothes with a fancy backpack. 
Enid & Rebecca are on the outside porch/walkway on the second floor of Josh's building. Enid POUNDS on his pasteboard door; the windows RATTLE with each hollow THUD. 
ENID JOSH! 
REBECCA JOSH! 
ENID & REBECCA JOSH! 
ENID He's probably in there jerking off. 
REBECCA I'll bet he never jerks off... 
ENID Yeah, he's beyond human stuff like that. 
REBECCA Should we leave a note? 
Enid finds a piece of paper - the back of a pizza flyer. 
ENID Do you have a pen? 
She writes, while Rebecca looks over her shoulder. "Dear Josh. We came by to fuck you but you didn't answer the door. Therefore you are gay. Signed, Tiffany and Amber." 
REBECCA You're not really going to leave that are you? 
Enid pushes the note over his doorknob. 
EXT. ENTERING ZINE-O-PHOBIA BOOKSTORE - DAY 
REBECCA Why are we going here? I hate this place. 
ENID It'll only take a second. 
INT. ZINE-O-PHOBIA BOOKSTORE - DAY 
They enter. We see racks of books-with titles like "Make Explosives At Home." Rebecca walks over to the magazine rack. 
CREEP #1 -- I'm telling you, you're wrong -- carpet beetles are the only way to get the flesh off a corpse...  Boiling is strictly for amateurs! 
ENID Don't you creeps ever talk about anything nice? Don't you ever talk about fluffy kittens or the Easter Bunny? 
CREEP #1 Look who's talking - little miss badass... 
CREEP #2 Yeah, nice outfit - who are you supposed to be, Cyndi Lauper? 
ENID Blow me, doofus! 
John Ellis emerges from the back and begins to unload a box of books onto the shelves. He stops and looks at Enid. 
JOHN ELLIS Didn't they tell you? 
ENID Tell me what? 
JOHN ELLIS Punk rock is over! 
ENID I know it's over, asshole, I -- 
JOHN ELLIS If you really want to "fuck up the system" - you should go to business school -- that's what I'm gonna do: get a job at some big corporation and fuck things up from the inside! 
ENID That's not even -- 
JOHN ELLIS Yeah yeah yeah. Do you have my money? 
She wads up a twenty-dollar bill and throws it at him. 
JOHN ELLIS Oh, how "punk." 
ENID That tape sucked, by the way! 
JOHN ELLIS I'm so sorry if you were offended! 
He heads toward the back room with the empty box. 
ENID Go die, asshole! 
JOHN ELLIS Get a job! 
He exits. Rebecca walks over to Enid. 
REBECCA What was that all about? 
ENID It's not like I'm some modern Punk dickhead... It's obviously supposed to be a 1977 Punk look, but I guess Johnny Fuckface is too stupid to get it! 
REBECCA I didn't get it either. 
ENID Everybody's too stupid! 
We see several sketches, including the drawing of the SATANISTS. Roberta shows a few pages to the class. 
ROBERTA I think that Phillip and Enid can help us to see that there are-many different ways we can express ourselves.  We can do things like these cartoons that are amusing as a sort of light entertainment or we can do work that is more serious in scope and feeling and that deals with issues; emotional, spiritual, political; of great importance. I hope that you will each have the tools to do that type of work by the end of this class. (pause, points at WIRE SCULPTURE) Who is responsible for this? 
MARGARET I am. 
ROBERTA Talk to us about it... 
MARGARET It's my response to the issue of a woman's right to choose... it's something I feel super-strongly about. 
ROBERTA Isn't this a wonderful piece, class? This definitely falls into that higher category of art I was speaking of earlier. 
MARGARET glances over at Enid. Enid gives her a dirty look. 
INT. "MASTERPIECE VIDEO" STORE - AFTERNOON. 
On a monitor, a generic trailer is playing. 
MASTERPIECE EMPLOYEE #1 Hello and welcome to Masterpiece video. How may I help you this afternoon, sir? 
CUSTOMER I'm looking for a copy of 8 1/2. 
MASTERPIECE EMPLOYEE #1 Yessir! Is it a new release, sir? 
CUSTOMER No, it's the classic Italian film. 
MASTERPIECE EMPLOYEE #1 Let me look that up on the computer for you, sir! 
(FIDDLES WITH COMPUTER) Yes, here it is - 9 1/2 WEEKS with Mickey Rourke. It's in our "Erotic Dramas" section. 
CUSTOMER No, not "9 1/2", 8 1/2 , the Fellini film. 
MASTERPIECE EMPLOYEE #1 I'll check that for you sir. How do you spell the actor's name - F-I-L-E- E-P-E-E...? 
WE SEE Enid & Rebecca, dressed up in sexy outfits. 
REBECCA How about this one? 
ENID Hey, you have to see my new good luck charm. 
She pulls out a small porcelain figure of a MAN FLUSHING HIMSELF DOWN A TOILET with the words "Goodbye Cruel World" on the base. 
REBECCA Ew ... when did you get that? 
ENID This morning at Seymour's garage sale. 
REBECCA God, aren't you tired of Seymour yet? 
Rebecca picks up another tape. 
REBECCA How about this? 
ENID Forget it. I'm sure it sucks. All these movies suck. 
An obnoxious SIX-YEAR-OLD tries to get his PARENTS to add another tape to their already tall stack. He stares at the video monitor. 
Another MASTERPIECE EMPLOYEE reshelves videos near them. 
MASTERPIECE EMPLOYEE #2 (overly cheerful) Hello! How are you young ladies this evening? May I help you find a particular Masterpiece movie? 
ENID No. 
They walk by him. 
ENID Let's get out of here, this place makes me sick. 
REBECCA We have to do something fun tonight this is my last weekend of freedom before I start my stupid job. 
ENID I know a party we could go to... 
REBECCA What? Where?! 
ENID It's a surprise. 
REBECCA I don't believe you. 
ENID If I promise you there's really a party with a lot of guys, do you promise you'll go? 
INT. SEYMOUR & JOE'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING 
A depressing COLLECTORS' GET-TOGETHER in progress. Enid & Rebecca sit on an old sofa in the corner. Nine or ten RECORD COLLECTORS mill about. 
JEROME There are some records I will pay serious money for, provided they're a sincere V plus. Other than that I'd prefer to just have them on CD. 
STEVEN CDs will never have the presence of an original 78. 
ENID I'm talking to you... I'll bet there are tons of women who would go out with you in a minute! 
SEYMOUR Oh, right... 
ENID No really... I guarantee I could get you a date in like two seconds... 
SEYMOUR Good luck... 
ENID I'm totally serious! 
SEYMOUR Yeah, well... 
ENID I mean it -- You leave everything to me -- I'm going to be your own personal dating service! 
SEYMOUR I appreciate the offer but you really don't -- 
ENID Mark my words, by the end of this summer you'll be up to your neck in pussy! 
SEYMOUR Jesus! That's very nice of you Enid but I - I really -- 
EXT. CITY STREET - DAY 
As Enid and Seymour walk. A 20-ish secretary-type passes. 
ENID What about her? Would you go out with her? 
SEYMOUR I don't know, what kind of question is that? I mean it's totally irrelevant because a girl like that would never be caught dead with me... 
ENID But putting that aside for now, would you go out with her? 
SEYMOUR I really didn't get a good look at her. 
A breasty, overweight 40-year-old walks by. 
ENID Okay, what about this one? Are you into girls with big tits? 
SEYMOUR (embarrassed) Jesus! 
ENID C'mon Seymour, I'm trying to collect data here! Don't you want me to find you your perfect dream girl? 
SEYMOUR I'm just not one of those guys who has a "type"... 
ENID Every guy has a type! 
SEYMOUR (he doesn't really mean this) I mean as long as she's not a complete imbecile and she's even remotely attractive... 
They walk by "the pants." 
ENID Hey look, there's Norman! 
He's sitting as before at the defunct bus stop. 
ENID Hi Norman. 
Norman nods politely. Seymour looks quizzically at Enid. 
EXT. CITY STREET/NEAR SIDEWINDER - DAY 
They're in another part of town near THE SIDEWINDER. 
ENID We need to narrow this down somehow... we need to find a place where you can meet women who share your interests. 
SEYMOUR Maybe I don't want to meet someone who shares my interests.  I hate my interests! Where can I go to meet the exact opposite of myself? 
ENID Yeah yeah yeah... Just tell me your five main interests, in order of importance. 
SEYMOUR (sighs) Well, let's see... I guess I'd have to put Traditional Jazz, Blues, and Ragtime music at the top of the list, then probably... 
ENID Let's just say "music" - that way you only use up one... (spots The Sidewinder) Wait, we have to go in here for a second... 
INT. SIDEWINDER - DAY 
They enter. Josh has his back to the counter as he makes a complicated frozen yogurt sundae for a little girl. 
ENID Hi Josh. 
JOSH (without turning around) Hi. 
ENID I just stopped in to say hi. 
JOSH Yeah, well... hi... 
He turns around non-chalantly, holding the sundae. He looks up and sees Enid with the guy from Wowsville (Seymour). 
ENID This is my friend Seymour. 
YUPPIE #1 I'd like a medium latte for here. 
REBECCA Can I get you a biscotti to go with that? 
YUPPIE #1 NO! Just the latte. 
Enid is next wearing a RUBBER BONDAGE MASK with devil horns. 
ENID (V.O.) Give me all your money, bitch! 
REBECCA Where did you get that? 
ENID You won't believe it! Guess! 
REBECCA Where? 
ENID Anthony's II! 
REBECCA No way... when? 
ENID Just now... I went with Seymour. 
REBECCA You cunt! 
FELDMAN is in line behind Enid. He's a poodle-haired, fedora wearing eccentric in a motorized wheelchair-golf cart contraption. 
FELDMAN Excuse me - I can't read the trivia question! 
Enid is in the way. She reads it to him. 
ENID "Where on the human body is the 'Douglas Pouch' located?" 
Feldman grunts and starts to tap away on his powerbook while Rebecca, rolling her eyes, goes to get his coffee. A DIGITAL GRAPHIC of the FEMALE FORM on his computer screen. With a few keyboard strokes he zeroes in on a schematic of the REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM. An area behind the cervix BLINKS. 
FELDMAN Slightly below the uterus on a female. 
He takes his coffee and putters towards the door. 
ENID That guy is totally amazing. 
REBECCA He does that every single day. 
YUPPIE #2 Can I get a decaf mocha to go? 
REBECCA Can I get you a... 
YUPPIE #2 NO, I don't want a biscotti with that. 
YUPPIE #2 pays and leaves. 
ENID God, how can you stand all these assholes? 
REBECCA I don't know... Some people are okay, but mostly I feel like poisoning everybody. 
ENID At least the wheelchair guy is sort of entertaining... 
REBECCA He's a total asshole... He doesn't even need that wheelchair, he's just totally lazy! 
ENID That rules! 
REBECCA No, it doesn't. You'll see... you get totally sick of all the creeps and losers and weirdos. 
ENID But those are our people... 
REBECCA Yeah, well... (pause) So when are you going to get your job? 
ENID I'm working on it... I've got a few leads... it's just that right now I have, all these projects that take up all my time. 
REBECCA Like what? 
ENID Nothing. Don't worry... I promise I'll get a job next week. 
REBECCA (pause) God, I can't believe you went to Anthony's without me. 
INT. ENID'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Enid and her dad are eating breakfast. A 13" TV sits on the kitchen counter behind them. 
TV COMMERCIAL (V.O.) (sincere) Hope comes in all forms. To the endangered white stork searching for wetlands it comes in the form of a sanctuary provided by people who care. Do people care? Chevron does. That's why at Chevron we're just as concerned... 
DAD Are you still looking for a job? Do you have any leads? 
ENID Will you get off my back for once? 
DAD It's tough to find a good job without any kind of training. 
They both have drinks now. He puts on a jazz record, an instrumental. 
ENID (picks up an antique knick knack) Wow, this is so cool... 
SEYMOUR If you don't mind my asking -- why do you care so much if I get a date or not? 
ENID I dunno... because I can't stand the idea of a world where a guy like you can't get a date... 
Enid finds a PAINTING leaning in a pile of stuff against the wall in the corner. It's an old-fashioned cartoony stereotype of a black man's head, with big lips and a huge toothy smile. 
ENID What the fuck, Seymour?! What is this? 
SEYMOUR What?... Oh that... I borrowed that from work about fifteen years ago... I guess it's mine now. 
ENID What, are you a klansman or something? 
SEYMOUR Yeah, right, I'm a klansman - thanks a lot!... Do you know the Cook's Chicken franchise? 
ENID (quoting TV commercial in deep voice) "Four-piece Cook's special deep fried with side n' slaw it's OUT RAY-GEOUS"! 
SEYMOUR Yeah, well "Cook's" is just a made up name. When they originally opened back in 1922 they were named "The Coon Chicken Inn" -- that's an early painting of their first logo. 
He takes out a scrapbook. 
SEYMOUR I'm obsessed with all this stuff - this lost culture of the 20th century. 
She looks through the scrapbook - we see the Coon Chicken logo transform first into a less stereotyped black man, then into an older distinguished black chef with the logo "Cook's Chicken Inn." Then to a white version of the same chef, followed by a female white chef, then to a streamlined 90's version. On another page is a collection of cosmetic labels tracing the design evolution of a different company. 
ENID Why doesn't everybody know this? 
The record ends. Seymour gets up to take it off the turntable. 
SEYMOUR (somewhat bitterly) It's ancient history. The same reason nobody knows about this Lionel Belasco record. 
He puts on another record. 
SEYMOUR Actually, I was a whole lot more interested in the Cook's phenomenon when I was about your age. I've kind of lost interest since I've been working for them... 
ENID You work at Cook's Chicken? 
SEYMOUR For nineteen years... 
ENID What are you, a fry cook or something? 
SEYMOUR Nothing so glamorous... actually, I'm an assistant manager at their corporate headquarters. 
ENID Jesus, I'd go nuts if I had to work in an office all day. 
SEYMOUR Hey, I get good benefits, a good early retirement plan, nobody ever bothers me... 
ENID Yeah, but still... 
SEYMOUR I make enough money to eat and buy old records... what more do I want? 
Enid puts down the scrapbook, stares at the painting. 
ENID So, I don't really get it -- are you saying that things were better back then (points at painting) even though there was stuff like this? 
SEYMOUR No, in a lot of ways things are better now... I dunno... it's complicated. Everybody still hates each other, but they know how to hide it better, or something... 
ENID (suddenly) Hey, can I borrow this? 
SEYMOUR What? Why? 
ENID I promise I'll take good care of it. 
SEYMOUR I dunno... they're very sensitive at work about all this stuff. Maybe it would be better if you -- 
ENID Don't you trust me, Seymour? 
INT. ART CLASS - DAY 
We see another wall of student art dominated this time by Enid's (Seymour's) 3' x 4' painting. 
ROBERTA Let's address some discussion to this piece. 
SNOTTY GIRL I don't like it. 
ROBERTA Can you tell us why? 
SNOTTY GIRL I don't know. 
HIPPY-ISH BOY I think it's totally weak. 
BLACK GIRL Yeah, it's not right. 
ENID What? I'm just kidding around with the customers... It's my shtick! 
MANAGER Well lose it! And why aren't you pushing the large sizes? Didn't you get training about upsizing? 
ENID But I feel weird... it's so sleazy. 
MANAGER It's not optional! 
ENID Jesus... 
CUSTOMER #2 Can I get a medium sprite? 
ENID A medium sprite? Why sir, do you not know that for a mere twenty five cents more you could purchase a large beverage that has a volume of over twice that of a puny medium drink? (she gives MANAGER a look) ...I'm only telling you this because we're such good friends -- Medium is strictly for suckers who don't understand the concept of value! 
INT. THE COFFEE EXPERIENCE - DAY 
Rebecca is behind the counter glaring at Enid. 
REBECCA What are you talking about? What kind of loser gets fired after one day?! 
ENID I told you - my manager was a total asshole! Don't worry, I'm going to get another job... and anyway, I have some ideas for how to make money in the meantime... 
An angry CUSTOMER returns with her drink. 
CUSTOMER I'm not at all happy with this latte what do you intend to do about it? 
EXT. ENID'S GARAGE SALE - DAY 
It's the next day. Enid has set up a GARAGE SALE in front of her apartment building. Rebecca arrives. 
REBECCA This is it? I can't believe you're selling some of this stuff. 
ENID Fuck it. Everything must go! 
REBECCA Oh my god, I remember this hat... this was during your little old lady phase... 
A trendy young HIPSTER happens along and looks through the clothes, then to the table where he picks up a ridiculous looking stuffed animal. 
HIPSTER How much is this? 
ENID That's not for sale. 
HIPSTER (noticing price tag) Wait, it says five dollars... 
ENID Oh, that's a mistake -- I decided not to sell it... 
The HIPSTER looks around a little more and then leaves. 
REBECCA What was that all about? I thought everything must go! 
ENID Oh yeah right, like I'm gonna let some asshole with a goatee own Goofy Gus. 
A couple is browsing. The GIRL, a severely skinny, CLUBHOPPER TYPE in platform shoes looks at the clothes; the BOY, a long haired SKATEBOARDER, goes through her records. 
GIRL How much is this dress? 
REBECCA Oh my god, you're selling that? 
ENID (long pause) That's five hundred dollars. 
GIRL What? 
ENID Five hundred. 
GIRL You're crazy -- it should be like two dollars! 
ENID I was wearing that dress the day I lost my virginity. 
GIRL Well why do I care about that? 
ENID Why do you even want it? It would look stupid on you. 
GIRL God, fuck you! 
Enid turns to the boy - he's holding some records and a book. 
ENID Put that stuff back, it's not for sale. 
BOY What is this? Some fuckin' joke? 
ENID Yes! Go away! 
They stomp off. 
REBECCA Now are you going to get a regular job? 
SEYMOUR Let the machine get it. I have no desire to talk to anyone who would be calling me... 
After several more RINGS the machine picks up and we hear Seymour's message. After the BEEP there's a long fumbling pause... 
SEYMOUR I knew it... it's my mother. 
VOICE ON MACHINE Uh... HI!  Uh... I'm calling for... um... you placed an ad in the Weekly over a month ago and... well, I'm the redhead in the yellow dress... at least I think I am... I saw the ad when you first placed it but I was in this relationship at the time so I cut it out, and now I'm not in the relationship anymore... (giggles) God, this is really confusing... anyway, if you still want to talk to me I can be reached at KL5-2603, that's my work number and my name is Dana... um... BYE! 
ENID Wow! (feigning ignorance) What was that all about? 
SEYMOUR It's just somebody's idea of a joke... 
ENID That didn't sound like a joke to me... what, did you write a personal ad or something? 
SEYMOUR (still confused) Uh yeah. A long time ago... she called before once... it's just somebody trying to humiliate me. 
ENID Seymour! I promise you that wasn't a joke -- you have to call her back! 
SEYMOUR How can you be so sure? 
ENID Well, uh... I'm an expert-about stuff like this -- she was totally for real! 
INT. ENID'S APARTMENT - ABOUT 10 PM 
Enid enters - a light is on in the kitchen. 
DAD (O.S.) Pumpkin? Could you come in here for a minute? 
She walks slowly to the kitchen - a suspenseful moment. She sees, first, her Dad (wearing an apron) and then, a hauntingly familiar MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN. 
DAD Pumpkin, do you remember Maxine? 
MAXINE Hi, Enid. 
ENID Hi. (to Dad) Look, I'm kind of tired - I think I'll go to bed. 
DAD I made spaghetti. Do you want some? 
ENID I-I really have to get up early for class tomorrow. 
MAXINE It's really quite something to see you all grown up like this, Enid. (no response from Enid) I'd love to hear about what you're doing. I can't help but feel that I had some small part in how you turned out... (another silent pause) What are you studying? You were always such a smart little girl. 
ENID I'm taking a remedial high school art class for fuck-ups and retards. 
INT. ART CLASS - DAY 
A toothy, zit-covered 14-YEAR-OLD BOY poses with a very poorly- made sculpture. A flash goes off and he jumps slightly, sending pieces of his sculpture flying. 
It's Roberta, taking photos. She moves on to Enid, in front of her big painting. 
ROBERTA Smile, Enid... 
Enid ad-libs a weird expression as... the flash goes off. 
Roberta now turns to address the class. 
ROBERTA I'm going to miss you people... I feel that we've all done a lot of growing this summer. I hope that each of you feels as though you'll be taking away something from this experience; I know I certainly will be... 
A long "poignant" pause as she smiles admiringly at them. 
ROBERTA Remember, the art show is this Saturday at seven-thirty sharp. Try to get there at least 15 minutes early. 
The students get their things together and file out. 
ROBERTA Enid, can I talk to you for a minute? 
ENID Uh-oh. 
ROBERTA Don't worry - it's nothing bad. I was just wondering what your plans were for next year? 
ENID I'm not really sure - working, I guess... 
ROBERTA Well, I know this is really short notice, but I got a call from a very close friend at the Academy of Art & Design and she tells me that I'm allowed to place one student from your graduating class in a one year scholarship program... and, well, I hope you don't mind, Enid, but I took the liberty of submitting your name. 
She gives her a booklet and an application form. 
ENID Hmm. 
ROBERTA As far as I know it includes housing and meals and everything... it is really quite an offer... 
ENID ...wow... 
ROBERTA (pause) So what do you think? 
ENID I dunno... Would I have to take classes and stuff? 
She shuts off the stereo as he sits and eats his ice cream. 
DANA I'm so excited to see this film - Dustoffvarnya is such a brilliant director! Did you see his last film, The Flower That Drank The Moon? It was simply glorious! 
SEYMOUR Uh, no. I missed that one. But what do I know? I like Laurel and Hardy movies. 
DANA Really? I never really cared for those. Why does the fat one always have to be so mean to the skinny one? 
INT. ENID'S ROOM - EVENING 
It's 9:30 PM. Enid is drawing in her sketchbook. She looks impatiently at the phone. Time passes - it's 11 PM. She can't stand it anymore. 
INT. SEYMOUR'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 
Seymour picks up the phone. Dana is in the background getting some ice in the kitchen. 
SEYMOUR Uh... hello? 
ENID Hi, it's me... 
SEYMOUR Oh, hi... 
ENID So, what happened? 
SEYMOUR (almost whispering) Actually, it's kind of still happening... she's over here right now... I think everything's going pretty well... 
ENID What? You're kidding me... 
SEYMOUR Yeah, so I better go -- it's not really the best time to talk... 
ENID What, are you going to like have sex with her on your first date? 
SEYMOUR Jesus, Enid... I'll talk to you later... bye! 
He hangs up. Enid is stunned... Now what? She calls Rebecca. 
INT. OOMIE'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Rebecca is sitting on the couch in her pajamas when the phone RINGS. She picks it up. 
REBECCA Hello? 
ENID Do you still want to do something tonight? 
REBECCA What happened to Seymour? 
ENID (still shocked by this) I can't believe it - he actually scored! 
REBECCA How repulsive! 
ENID So should I come over? 
REBECCA Actually, I'm just about to go out with some friends... 
ENID What are you talking about? Who? 
REBECCA Just some people from work... 
ENID I don't believe you. 
REBECCA Yeah well, you said you were busy... look, I'd better get going... I'll call you tomorrow. 
Rebecca hangs up. Clearly, she's not going anywhere. 
EXT. JOSH'S APARTMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT 
Enid stands outside Josh's door. A tentative pause; then she knocks. Josh opens the door, stunned. Enid is wearing an uncharacteristically "sexy" outfit. 
JOSH Hi... what's up? 
ENID Can I come in? 
INT. JOSH'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 
She goes in and looks around nervously... the note (Tiffany & Amber) is tacked to the wall. 
JOSH Are you the one who left that note? 
ENID I guess. 
Pause. Enid sits down on futon/sofa. 
JOSH So what's up? 
He picks up half-finished beer and drinks self-consciously. 
Seymour sits alone eating lunch. We see Enid approach stealthily from behind. 
ENID Boo! 
SEYMOUR (very startled) YAAA! 
She sits across from him. 
ENID Where have you been? I've been looking all over for you... I've been wandering the streets day and night trying to find you... 
SEYMOUR Really? 
ENID No, actually Joe told me you were here... so how come you never call me anymore? 
SEYMOUR I know, I'm sorry... I-I've been really busy... 
ENID Yeah, I'll bet! So, how's it going with what's-her-name? Dana? 
SEYMOUR (he looks nervously at his watch) Oh... pretty well, surprisingly... you know... 
ENID So, what kind of stuff do you guys do together? Is she into old records and stuff? 
SEYMOUR Sort of... she doesn't dislike any of that stuff... she's trying, anyway... actually, we're supposed to go antique shopping for her apartment this afternoon... 
ENID (not convinced) Sounds good... 
Seymour looks again at his watch. 
SEYMOUR We really should get together sometime soon... I-I'll definitely call you this week -- 
ENID What, are you trying to get rid of me? 
SEYMOUR No... no, it's just that I should get going in a few minutes, and -- 
ENID Aren't you even going to ask me how I'm doing? 
SEYMOUR I-I'm sorry... uh so... uh... how -- 
ENID I dunno... okay, I guess... (pause) I fucked that guy Josh finally... 
SEYMOUR ...so... is he your boyfriend now? 
ENID Maybe... I dunno... He wants to be, of course. I'm weighing several offers at the present time... 
Suddenly, Dana enters. 
DANA Seymour?... uh... hello... I guess I'm a little early... 
SEYMOUR Dana! Hi! (pause as the gears whirl) Uh, Dana... this is Enid... 
DANA Hello... 
ENID It's great to finally meet you! 
Dana sits next to Seymour, facing Enid. 
DANA (looking back and forth between Enid and Seymour) How do you two know each other? 
ENID I'm surprised he hasn't mentioned me we're old friends. 
DANA Really? 
ENID Yes, we're very close... In fact, I was standing right next to Seymour the first time you called. If not for me, he would have never called you back! 
DANA Is that right? 
Seymour begins to stammer some kind of response. 
ENID (phony) Oops! Look at the time!  I've got to run! I'll stop by to see you some time, Seymour... (then to Dana) It was really great to meet you! 
INT. ENID'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT EVENING 
Enid is in her room getting dressed. Dad enters. 
DAD I have some good news for you, Pumpkin. 
ENID (sigh) What is it now? 
DAD Are you still looking for a job? 
ENID I guess. 
DAD Well, Maxine thinks she can get you a sales job at Computer Station. Normally you have to have references and at least two years of experience, but she thinks she can convince them. 
ENID Tell her to forget it - I don't need her help. 
ENID You need a bigger place - this is like a little kid's room. 
SEYMOUR I could never move - I've got too much stuff. 
Enid notices an extremely ugly modern sculpture in the corner. She goes over and picks it up. 
ENID Where did you get this? 
SEYMOUR Dana bought it when we went antique shopping. She said it didn't go with her stuff, so she gave it to me... she thought it fit in better with my "old time thingamajigs." 
ENID Jesus, how can you stand her? 
Seymour takes another slug off the bottle. 
SEYMOUR God, she's going to kill me... this bottle is half-empty! 
ENID That's great! "Half-empty" - that's what I like about you, Seymour, you're a natural pessimist! 
SEYMOUR If you expect the worst, you're never disappointed. 
ENID What are you talking about? You're disappointed every minute of your life. 
SEYMOUR I'm just being realistic. 
ENID At least you're not like every other stupid guy in the world - all they care about are guitars and sports... they're all such fags! 
SEYMOUR I hate sports. 
ENID How come in all that time I was trying to get you a date, you never asked me out? 
SEYMOUR You're a beautiful young girl... I can't imagine you would ever have had any interest in me, except as an amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity. 
ENID Yeah, but still... it's kind of insulting for a girl to be ignored like that. 
SEYMOUR I mean... of course I... why wouldn't I want to go out with you? 
ENID I dunno... I always feel like everybody secretly hates me. I'm just paranoid I guess. I mean, you like me don't you? We're good friends, right? 
SEYMOUR Yeah, sure. Of course. 
ENID (contemplative pause) ...Maybe I should just move in here with you... I could do all the cooking and dust your record collection and stuff until I get a job. 
SEYMOUR What about Joe? 
ENID Oh yeah... and Dana... (says her name with whiny, disdainful voice) You were a lot more fun before you met Dana. You've been acting way too normal lately... you're a bitter, twisted, fucked-up guy, Seymour, that's why I like you. 
SEYMOUR (more drunk than before) Yeah, well I like you too... 
TEN MINUTES LATER 
The bottle is empty. 
ENID You know what my number one fantasy used to be? 
SEYMOUR (pause) What? 
ENID I used to think about one day not telling anybody and just taking off and going to some random place... Do you ever think about stuff like that? 
SEYMOUR I guess I probably used to when I was your age. 
ENID It would have to be some totally average day when nobody was expecting it, and I'd just disappear and they'd never see me again. 
SEYMOUR Sounds like a healthy way to deal with your problems. 
ENID You know what we should do? Let's go get in your car right now and just take off! We could just drive away and find some new place and start a whole new life... fuck everybody! 
SEYMOUR I don't think I'm in any condition to drive. 
ENID I'll drive, then -- we'll go out in a blaze of glory! 
SEYMOUR So where would we go? 
ENID Who cares? Let's just go... what's stopping us? 
SEYMOUR I dunno, I... 
ENID I'm serious! I'm just so sick of everybody! Why can't I just do whatever I want? 
SEYMOUR What do you want? 
ENID What do you want? 
SEYMOUR I-I-I... 
ENID What's the matter with you, Seymour? Don't you like me? Be a man for once in your life! 
MAXINE May I ask what you're doing? 
ENID Shhh! 
MAXINE I want to know what you think you're doing, staying out all night and worrying your father to death! 
ENID Oh yeah, like he even noticed. 
MAXINE Listen, young lady... I know you don't like me -- I don't really care whether you do or not -- but I will not allow you to treat your father the way you do. 
We hear Seymour on the machine in the background... 
SEYMOUR (V.O.) I really want to talk to you. I've been thinking about what you said about moving in here... 
ENID I can treat him any way I want to - I'm an adult! Leave me alone! 
Maxine leaves. Seymour finishes his message. Enid picks up the phone and dials. 
REBECCA (V.O.) Hello? 
ENID I need to talk to you. 
INT. THE COFFEE EXPERIENCE - DAY 
Enid & Rebecca sit at a table. Rebecca is wearing her uniform. 
ENID I'm sorry about the other day. I don't know what's wrong with me... I really do want to move in with you. 
REBECCA I don't know... I was thinking maybe I should live alone. I decided to rent that place we looked at. I'm moving in next week. 
ENID Please let me come with you. Please please please... 
REBECCA I don't know - I'm not sure it's a good idea. 
ENID Of course it's a good idea... it's our plan. 
REBECCA But how are you gonna pay rent and everything? You don't even have a job. 
ENID I'll get a job tomorrow, I promise. If I don't, you can totally tell me to fuck off. 
INT. ENID'S ROOM - LATE MORNING 
Enid is putting on her shoes. Her Dad opens the door slightly and sticks his head in. 
DAD Pumpkin, are you in there? 
ENID Are you going to yell at me? 
DAD About what? 
DAD Yeah, I heard about that. 
ENID I was in a horrible mood - tell her not to worry, I'll be completely out of her life in a few days. 
DAD She understands what you're going through and she really wants to help you. She says that job at Computer Station is still available if you want it. 
ENID I-I'm not sure... yeah, maybe. 
DAD Actually, I was just checking to see if you were here - your friend Seymour is on his way up. 
ENID What do you mean "on his way up"!? 
DAD I just buzzed him in. 
Just then, three sharp KNOCKS on the front door. 
ENID What's wrong with you?! Tell him I'm not here! 
DAD But I can't -- 
ENID JUST DO IT! 
Dad goes to answer the door. Enid hides in her room. 
DAD (V.O.) I'm not sure when she'll be back... 
Enid looks out the window and sees Seymour walking away. She has a terribly sad look on her face. 
INT. SEYMOUR'S BEDROOM - EVENING 
Seymour sits in dim light, dialing an antique "candlestick" telephone. In the background, a Peter, Paul and Mary concert plays on the TV. We hear three rings followed by Enid's answering machine message. He hangs up before it finishes. Joe walks by the doorway. 
JOE Well, here's where the fun never stops! 
SEYMOUR Yeah, I'm really, really happy. Really having a good time. 
REBECCA (allows him to step inside but leaves the door open) Are you sure she wasn't there?  Maybe she was just hiding from you. 
SEYMOUR Why would she be hiding from me? 
REBECCA I don't know... where is she, then? 
SEYMOUR Maybe she's with Josh? 
REBECCA Josh!? Why would she be with Josh? 
SEYMOUR I don't know. 
REBECCA Why? What did she tell you? 
SEYMOUR She just mentioned him a few times and said that they had been dating - I thought maybe she was... 
REBECCA What? Is she having some secret affair with Josh? 
SEYMOUR I have no idea - I just want to... 
REBECCA Why wouldn't she tell me? There's no way! She could never keep that to herself... you're crazy. 
SEYMOUR Really, I don't know enough about it to... 
REBECCA That slut! 
SEYMOUR (changing subject back to me) Why did you say she might be hiding from me? Did she say anything to you about me? 
REBECCA (getting revenge on Seymour) Yeah, she thinks you're a dork. 
SEYMOUR Did she say that? 
REBECCA Look, what do you expect?  Considering how we met you. 
SEYMOUR What do you mean? 
REBECCA On that pathetic fake blind date. 
SEYMOUR What are you talking about? 
REBECCA Didn't she ever tell you about that? God, she really is pathological... 
SEYMOUR What fake blind date? What are you talking about? 
Rebecca goes over and gets Enid's sketchbook out of the box and flips through it. When she gets to the right page she hands it to Seymour. 
REBECCA Here. Read it and weep. 
We see a pasted-up PERSONAL AD beside a DRAWING OF SEYMOUR in Wowsville. On the facing page we see a drawing of JOSH with his name surrounded by RED HEARTS. 
EXT. SIDEWINDER - AFTERNOON 
Seymour's car screeches into the parking lot. He bursts into the store, ready for once in his life to make a scene. 
INT. SIDEWINDER - AFTERNOON 
Josh is behind the counter cleaning the Slurpee machine, with his back to the entrance, as Seymour storms in. Doug is over by the magazine rack reading a dirt bike magazine. 
SEYMOUR I hope you had a good laugh at my expense. 
Josh turns around - what's going on? He recognizes Seymour. 
JOSH Huh... oh... hi... uh... 
SEYMOUR You want to see something funny? I'll show you something funny! 
As he says this he flips over a SMALL DISPLAY RACK of potato chips. Then he tries to flip over a BIG DISPLAY CASE in front of the counter but is unable to budge it - he keeps trying and gets more and more frustrated. 
JOSH HEY! 
Josh runs from behind the counter to stop him before he creates a huge mess. He tries to grab Seymour and they get into a ridiculous frantic scuffle. Seymour starts yelling. Suddenly Doug appears and gets Seymour in a choke hold with his nunchucks. Doug ad-libs cop-style jargon. Josh is freaked out. Seymour realizes what a fool he is and starts to cry. 
The Boss comes out of the back room... 
BOSS Josh! What going on here?! 
INT. ENID & REBECCA'S APARTMENT - AROUND MIDNIGHT 
The apartment is dark - lit only by a harsh, annoying streetlight. Rebecca sits on the couch in sweat clothes, exasperated. She goes to look out the window. Cars with loud radios can be heard driving by. She goes to the phone - she checks it and hangs up. Pause. She picks it up again - one last try. She dials the number and waits. We hear the BEEP of the answering machine. Rebecca hangs up. 
She gets into a sleeping bag (spread out in the center of a cold linoleum floor). She zips the zipper all the way over her head and curls up into a whimpering ball. 
FADE TO BLACK 
TITLE CARD: "SEVERAL MONTHS LATER"

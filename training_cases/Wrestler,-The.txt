FADE IN: 
MUSIC: DEF LEPPARD - "ROCK ROCK (TILL YOU DROP)" 
Over OPENING CREDITS, a montage of OLD WRESTLING-MAGAZINE PHOTOS. Action shots of RANDY "THE RAM" ROBINSON taking on a keffiyeh-wearing heel named THE AYATOLLAH before 20,000 screaming fans at Madison Square Garden. 
The sounds of a SCREAMING, CHEERING CROWD overwhelm us. Over the images, RINGSIDE ANNOUNCERS boom commentary: 
----"Oh, my! Ram hit with a devastating piledriver!" 
----"I've never seen a guy get fired into a buckle that hard!" 
----"The Ayatollah taking it to The Ram outside the ring!" 
----"Ram absorbing tremendous punishment! How much more can he take?" 
----"Wait a minute... Look at this... The Ram is getting up!" 
----"He's coming back! I don't believe it!" 
----"Suplex!" 
----"Powerbomb!" 
----"Randy The Ram Robinson giving absolutely everything he's got! This is the very definition of heart!" 
----"Just listen to this crowd! The entire Garden, 20,000 people, are on their feet!" 
----"Ram climbing to the top rope... The crowd going wild... They know what's coming..." 
A PHOTO of Randy standing on the top rope, his bent arms pressed against the sides of his head like RAM'S HORNS. 
----"Uh-oh, the horns are out... Here it comes..." 
We FREEZE on a final image of Randy FLYING HIGH ABOVE THE CANVAS, horns out, poised to crash down on The Ayatollah. 
----"Ram Jam! Lights out!!" 
Over this, the sound of the crowd GOING CRAZY. 
The Def Leppard song rings out as we... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. EAST WILMINGTON HIGH SCHOOL - LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT 
Present day. Post-match. Randy, pushing 50, still with the same long, dyed-blond mane, sits on a bench in the boys locker room of a Wilmington, Delaware high school. 
CHYRON: 20 YEARS LATER 
He pulls off his purple spandex wrestling tights. Lime-green ram's horns run up the sides. They're the same kind of tights as in the `80s pics----and may well be the actual same pair. 
Naked except for a jockstrap, Randy takes a breath. Achy, sweaty, saggy, exhausted. A battered warrior. Scars all over his body. Despite the rough shape he's in, it's clear he's just given it his all in the ring. He swigs down a few pills with a beer. 
Promoter SCOTT BRUMBERG, a heavyset man in a Mets jersey with BRUMBERG - 44 on the back, approaches. 
SCOTT BRUMBERG Great show, Ram. Ya turned it out. (a little sad) As always. 
He hands Randy some cash. Randy counts it. It's not much. 
SCOTT BRUMBERG (CONT'D) Sorry. I was sure the gate'd be bigger. 
Randy just shrugs resignedly. 
EXT. EAST WILMINGTON HIGH SCHOOL - SHORT TIME LATER 
Randy, changed into his street clothes, limps out of the school, each step labored and painful. Waiting near the entrance are TWO FANS, both men in their 30s. 
FAN #1 Yo, Ram. Think you could...? 
Fan #1 holds out a SHARPIE and an old WRESTLING PROGRAM from the `80s. On the cover is a shot of Randy wrestling CORPORAL PUNISHMENT, a heel in a drill instructor get-up. 
Randy takes the program, happy to oblige. 
FAN #1 (CONT'D) I was there. 
Randy hands back the program. FAN #2 hands him a MINI-POSTER. The faded, mid-'80s poster features Randy, biceps bulging, crushing a head of broccoli between his fists. Across the top, it says "EAT YOUR VEGETABLES, PUNK!" 
FAN #2 (as Randy signs) My first match ever was you versus Davey Diamond at the Spectrum. (NOSTALGIC) 
Randy smiles a little. He remembers, too. He hands back the poster. Fan #2 looks fondly at Randy, a part of his boyhood. 
FAN #2 (CONT'D) (vaguely sad) You were awesome. 
Randy nods, a bit uncomfortably. The two fans, muttering thanks, drift off into the Delaware night. Randy is left standing alone, still holding Fan #1's pen. 
He walks over to a beat-up old CONVERSION VAN and climbs in. Turns on the engine. Music starts up on the stereo mid-song. 
MUSIC: CINDERELLA - "DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU GOT (TIL IT'S GONE)" 
Randy enters a suburban Shop-Rite. 
INT. SHOP-RITE - SHORT TIME LATER 
Randy sticks his head in a door marked MANAGER'S OFFICE. 
RANDY Hey, Wayne. 
INT. WAYNE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
Sitting behind a desk is store manager WAYNE (40). He looks up at Randy, irked. 
WAYNE Do we not know how to knock? 
Wayne casually clicks a porn site closed on his computer. 
WAYNE (CONT'D) Let's try that again. 
Randy steps out and closes the door behind him. He knocks. 
WAYNE (CONT'D) Come in! 
Randy enters. 
WAYNE (CONT'D) Oh, hi, Randy! What can I do for you? 
Randy groans privately. He really hates Wayne. 
RANDY Do you have any extra shifts you could throw my way? 
WAYNE What's the matter, they raise the price of tights? 
Randy is not amused. Wayne grabs a LOOSELEAF BINDER. 
WAYNE (CONT'D) Let's see what we got. 
Wayne starts flipping through. 
RANDY Pretty much anything weekday... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SHOP-RITE - REAR LOADING DOCK - DAY 
Randy, working alongside some MEXICAN GUYS, lifts a STACK OF BOXES off the back of a BOAR'S HEAD DELIVERY TRUCK. 
He carries the boxes through a RUBBER-STRIP CURTAIN, into a WALK-IN COOLER. He puts them down and heads back out again. 
CUT TO: 
INT. OGDEN'S GYM - LOCKER ROOM - DAY 
Randy stands with GREGG, a huge bodybuilder who's counting off some bills. Randy growls with displeasure at the small, liquid-filled GLASS BOTTLE in his hand. 
ANGLE ON bottle: The label says SUSTANON 250. The rest of the label is in SPANISH. 
GREGG I'm tellin' ya, bro, it's identical to the German. 
RANDY I tried Mexican sus once. Gave me bitch tits. 
GREGG Years ago, right? Mexican's way better now. 
RANDY I don't want this. 
GREGG Bro, it's the same. 
RANDY I want my German. 
GREGG I don't have any. 
RANDY Yeah? 
Randy steps in front of Gregg's locker and starts ROOTING AROUND. 
GREGG What are you doing? 
Randy finds a bottle with GERMAN WRITING on it. 
GREGG (CONT'D) That's my own stash. That's my last one. 
Randy puts the bottle of Mexican sustanon in the locker and walks off with the German. 
RANDY Danke schoen. 
INT. LOCKER ROOM - TOILET STALL - SHORT TIME LATER 
Randy, underwear pulled down, plunges a needle into his ass cheek. 
INT. GYM FLOOR - SHORT TIME LATER 
Randy is BENCHPRESSING. He grunts loudly as he squeezes out one more rep, his SPOTTER urging him on. 
SPOTTER Push it out----you got this! 
INT. SUNSATIONS TANNING SALON - LATER 
A strip-mall tanning salon. Randy breezes in, nodding hello to the FRONT-DESK WOMAN, who's on the phone. 
RANDY What's up? 
STEPHANIE I'm here because... 
Stephanie gathers herself. This isn't easy for her. 
STEPHANIE (CONT'D) I came to make amends. 
RANDY Amends? 
STEPHANIE I'm supposed to talk to people I've hurt. 
Randy is puzzled for a moment. Then, it clicks in. 
RANDY Ohh... 12-stepper. 
STEPHANIE (NODS) AA. 
RANDY Good for you. That's great. 
STEPHANIE Thank you. I'm sure you mean that. 
RANDY I do. 
She smile-nods insincerely. 
RANDY (CONT'D) So's that it? 
STEPHANIE I need to apologize. 
RANDY For what? 
STEPHANIE For anything I've done or said over the years. All the anger at you. 
RANDY Okay... 
STEPHANIE Like the last time I saw you... I'm sorry for what I said. 
RANDY (dismissive wave) Don't worry about it. 
Stephanie is irked by his lack of engagement. She looks at him with suspicion. 
STEPHANIE Do you even know what I said? 
RANDY Sure. 
STEPHANIE What did I say? 
RANDY It was about your mom. And me. (vague, flailing) Like, how I was bad. 
STEPHANIE You have no idea. 
MAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Raa-am! 
Randy turns and sees TWO MEATHEAD FANS down the hall, headed his way. 
MEATHEAD #1 Whassup, yo? Randy The Ram! 
MEATHEAD #1 gives Randy an excited high-five. 
MEATHEAD #2 We gonna see some action tonight? 
RANDY (sly grin) Tonight's forecast calls for severe butt-whoopin's with a 100 percent chance of pain. 
Psyched "Yeah!"s from the meatheads. Stephanie is pissed at the interruption. And, even more, Randy's embrace of it. 
MEATHEAD #1 Could we get a picture? 
RANDY No problemo. 
The two meatheads flank Randy, their arms around his broad shoulders. Meathead #1 looks tentatively at Stephanie, holding up his DIGITAL CAMERA. 
MEATHEAD #1 Think you could...? 
She coldly takes it. 
STEPHANIE No problemo. 
She looks into the camera. The meatheads stick their tongues out and throw up devil signs. Randy flexes theatrically, making his best "Aaargh!" wrestling face. 
Stephanie snaps a shot. Meathead #1 takes back his camera. He and his buddy pat Randy heartily on the back. 
MEATHEAD #1 Thanks a lot, yo. Kick some ass out there. 
RANDY You know it, broski! 
The meatheads excitedly head off. 
Randy turns his attention back to Stephanie, who's glaring at him with cold disgust. 
RANDY (CONT'D) What? 
STEPHANIE Same shit. 
RANDY They're fans. 
STEPHANIE Same old shit. 
Randy, on a post-match high, sits on a cafeteria table enjoying a beer as a pseudo-MEDIC stitches up his hairline gash. Nick Volpe wanders over. 
MEDIC Ram, man, you popped that crowd. 
Randy smiles contentedly. He sure did. 
NICK VOLPE (O.S.) Yo, Ram. Got a sec? 
Nick Volpe comes over. 
RANDY For you, needledick? Always. 
NICK VOLPE Do you realize what's coming up? 
Randy looks at him, unsure. 
NICK VOLPE (CONT'D) May 6th... 
Randy racks his brains. He has no idea. 
NICK VOLPE (CONT'D) 20th anniversary of you and Ayatollah at the Garden. 
RANDY (AMAZED) Holy shit... 
NICK VOLPE I know. Time fuckin' flies. 
Randy sees an excited smile creep across Volpe's face. 
RANDY Whatcha thinkin'? 
NICK VOLPE Two words: Re. Match. 
Randy is instantly intrigued. 
NICK VOLPE (CONT'D) I'm doing a big Fanfest thing down in South Carolina that weekend. I wanna main-event it with you two. 
RANDY Yeah? 
NICK VOLPE Ram-Ayatollah II. 20th anniversary. Hundreds, thousands of screaming fans watching you two make history for the second time. 
RANDY Think Bob'd get back in there? He's pretty retired. 
NICK VOLPE For this? (cool, confident nod) I bet he'd be willing to dust off the old turban. 
Randy's mouth is practically watering. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. CHEETAH'S - PARKING LOT - SHORT TIME LATER 
A spring in his hobbled step, Randy gets out of the van and heads toward Cheetah's, the strip club he passed earlier. Manning the door is BIG CHRIS, a huge bouncer/doorman. 
BIG CHRIS Whassup, Ram? How ya been? 
RANDY Yo, Big Chris. 
They chummily shake hands. Big Chris pulls Randy in tight. 
BIG CHRIS (into Randy's ear) Hey, can you get me any more of that IGF-1? 
RANDY What do I look like, some fuckin' two-bit street dealer? 
BIG CHRIS C'mon, hook a brother up. You get the family discount. 
RANDY Swing by the mansion. Any day this week. 
BIG CHRIS You da man, Ram! 
INT. CHEETAH'S - SHORT TIME LATER 
MUSIC: BIRDMAN & LIL WAYNE - "STUNTIN' LIKE MY DADDY" 
A crowded, not-very-glamorous Jersey strip club. Randy stands over by the bar. The female BARTENDER slides him a beer. 
RANDY Thanks, hon. 
Randy takes a swig, looking around the club. 
RANDY (CONT'D) Cassidy around? 
BARTENDER I think she's VIP-in'. 
Randy, nodding, takes his beer and heads over toward the STAGE. He settles in at an open table. 
ON STAGE: 
A YOUNG STRIPPER (22) works the pole, grinding lewdly to "Stuntin' Like My Daddy", a bass-heavy Dirty South rap song. 
RANDY: 
Randy, watching her, quickly grows bored. He finds the stripper, like the song, crude and soulless. 
INT. CHEETAH'S - MEN'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Randy is at the urinal. He flushes and heads over to the sink. He washes his hands, checking his look in the mirror. He primps a little. 
INT. CHEETAH'S - MAIN ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
RANDY We're talking one of the historic matches in history. 20,000 people. Another million and a half watching at home on pay-per-view. 
She turns, giving him a nice view of her writhing behind. On the small of her back is an AC/DC TATTOO. 
RANDY (CONT'D) We were going back and forth, just killin' each other for a half hour. Any wrestling fan, they know all about it. 
CASSIDY Million and a half? Shit. 
RANDY Yeah, it was big. So a rematch... (smiles, contemplating the PROSPECT) History all over again. 
Cassidy turns around again. Randy looks her body up and down, savoring her curves as she dances just for him. 
RANDY (CONT'D) Goddamn you are smokin'. 
Cassidy smiles a little. This makes her feel good. 
"My Neck My Back" ENDS. Cassidy pulls back on her dress and casually sits down next to him. A new song comes on. 
MUSIC: PITBULL - "UNA MANO LAVA LA OTRA" 
They look toward the stage, where a PUERTO RICAN STRIPPER shakes her ass to the staccato, abrasive Latin rap song. 
RANDY (CONT'D) Who knows. I put on a good show... 
Cassidy nods supportively, sincerely. 
RANDY (CONT'D) Could be the thing that gets me back on top. 
CASSIDY You never know who's in that crowd. 
An ALARMED LOOK comes over Cassidy's face. 
CASSIDY (CONT'D) Jesus. 
Randy follows her eyes to his HAIRLINE. 
CASSIDY (CONT'D) You're bleeding. 
A small amount of BLOOD is trickling down from his stitches. He grabs a COCKTAIL NAPKIN and casually dabs it. 
RANDY Got cut tonight. 
CASSIDY You okay? 
RANDY Ah, it's nothing. 
CASSIDY (small chuckle) And they say wrestling's fake. 
Randy proudly holds out his arm. 
RANDY How's this for fake? 
CASSIDY'S POV: A long-ish SCAR on Randy's bicep. 
CASSIDY What's that from? 
RANDY 1986. Denver Coliseum. Billy Bob Banjo hit me with his two-by-four. Loose nail tore the bicep open. 
CASSIDY Ow. Fuck. 
RANDY I got even better. 
He pulls down his shirt collar, revealing a nasty COLLARBONE SCAR. 
RANDY (CONT'D) 1988. Orlando Arena. Mr. Magnificent tossed me out of the ring. Landed on my shoulder, clavicle snapped in half. 
CASSIDY Doesn't it hurt? 
RANDY (BLISSFUL) Not when they're going crazy for you... 
Cassidy stands up and straddles him, gazing soulfully at the scar. 
CASSIDY "He was pierced for our transgressions, He was crushed for our iniquities. The punishment that brought us peace was upon Him, and by His wounds we were healed." 
Randy contemplates the quote. He likes it. 
RANDY What's that? 
CASSIDY It's from "Passion of the Christ". (BEAT) You never seen it? 
Randy shrugs no. 
CASSIDY (CONT'D) Dude, you gotta. It's amazing. 
She sits down next to him again. 
CASSIDY (CONT'D) It's, like, so inspiring. They throw everything at Him. Whips, arrows, rocks... Just beat the living fuck out of Him for the whole two hours. And He just takes it. 
RANDY Huh. I'll have to check it out. 
Cassidy lightly traces a finger along Randy's bicep scar. 
CASSIDY The sacrificial Ram... 
The Pitbull song ends. A new song begins. 
MUSIC: MOTLEY CRUE - "GIRLS GIRLS GIRLS" 
Randy stands quiet and peaceful, head lowered slightly. 
ANNOUNCER (O.S.) From Elizabeth, New Jersey, weighing in at 218 pounds... The former WWF superstar and wrestling legend... The one, the only... (BEAT) Randy "The Ram" Robinnnnsonnnnn! 
THE GYM: 
Randy explodes into the gym, full of fire and showmanship. 
He does a lap around the outside of the ring. His hand is raised high in the air, index finger and pinky curled into a set of RAM'S HORNS. Fans do the same. 
Kids rush toward Randy, reaching out for HIGH FIVES. He obliges as many as he possibly can. 
Fans hold out FOLDING CHAIRS in front of him. (Just like in the opening montage.) He "rams" each one with his forehead. 
AC/DC If you want blood, You got it!/ If you want blood, You got it! 
He does a lap around the perimeter of the ring, enthusiastically head-butting chairs the whole way. 
AC/DC (CONT'D) Blood on the streets, Blood on the rocks/ Blood in the gutter, Every last drop/ If you want blood, you got it!! 
Randy climbs into the ring. He does a few neck rolls and knee bends, limbering up. 
The song fades down. A new song rises... 
MUSIC: CELTIC FROST - "DOMAIN OF DECAY" 
Ugly, plodding HARDCORE DEATH METAL. 
ANNOUNCER And his opponent: From Hampton, Virginia, weighing in at 295 pounds... 
The boos begin to rain down. 
ANNOUNCER (CONT'D) Hellbilly Cannibaaaal! 
Through the curtain, HELLBILLY CANNIBAL emerges. A huge, overalls-clad, mangy, wild-eyed masochist. Crumbs cling to his scraggly beard. He's dragging a heavy CANVAS SACK. 
A TEENAGER in the crowd holds up a sign reading HELLBILLY CANNIBAL SUCKS A FAT DICK. 
Hellbilly Cannibal climbs into the ring with his sack and a folding chair. He heads to the center of the ring, where Randy awaits. 
They sit down on chairs facing each other. Under Hellbilly Cannibal's chair is his canvas sack. Under Randy's is his Dollar Tree plastic shopping bag. 
Hellbilly Cannibal punches Randy. Randy punches Hellbilly Cannibal. They take turns punching each other, each shot a little harder than the last. It's like a violent game of "slaps". 
After a stretch of this, Hellbilly Cannibal reaches into his sack and pulls out a can of BUG SPRAY. He SPRAYS it in Randy's face. Randy falls off his chair. He staggers around the ring clutching his face, howling in agony. 
Hellbilly Cannibal smashes the blinded Randy over the head with his chair. Randy falls to his knees. Hellbilly Cannibal reaches into his sack and pulls out a FLUORESCENT LIGHT TUBE. Wielding it like a bat, he SMACKS RANDY in the face. The tube explodes with a pop. 
Grabbing a folding chair, Hellbilly Cannibal charges toward Randy. He takes a flying leap, riding the chair like a boogie board. Just as he's about to crash down on Randy, Randy ROLLS OUT OF THE WAY. Hellbilly Cannibal's spine gets a violent jolt as the chair hits the mat. 
Randy reaches into his Dollar Tree bag and pulls out an aluminum COOKIE TRAY. He smacks Hellbilly Cannibal in the face with it. The tray makes an awesomely loud METALLIC CLANG. Randy hits him a bunch more times. 
Randy is starting to get winded. His heart beats faster. 
He picks up Hellbilly Cannibal and flings him toward the ropes. Hellbilly Cannibal, bouncing off, ducks Randy's awaiting forearm. He bounces off the opposite ropes and crashes into Randy knee-first. 
Hellbilly Cannibal grabs Randy by the hair and smashes his face into the corner post. He scoops him up and FLIPS HIM OVER THE TOP ROPE, out of the ring. Randy LANDS HARD on the concrete floor. 
Hellbilly Cannibal hops out of the ring with the folding chair. He WHALES RANDY IN THE FACE with it. Randy stumbles backwards toward the metal barricade between the ring and the fans. Hellbilly Cannibal kicks him in the chest. Randy flips over the barricade, into the crowd. Fans scatter in an exhilarated panic. 
Hellbilly Cannibal throws Randy into a row of empty chairs. Randy goes sprawling. Chairs fly everywhere. 
Randy gets up. His heart is beating LOUD. FAST. 
Randy, dazed, heads toward the SNACK-BAR AREA. Hellbilly Cannibal follows after him. Randy grabs a metal GARBAGE CAN and WHIPS AROUND WITH IT, smacking Hellbilly Cannibal square in the face. Hellbilly Cannibal goes down. 
Randy shakes out the can's contents over Hellbilly Cannibal, showering him in trash. He shoves Hellbilly Cannibal's head into the can and falls on it, ass-first. 
Randy grabs the ladder resting along the base of the ring. He POUNDS THE GARBAGE CAN with it, making an UNHOLY RACKET. 
With the can still over his head, Hellbilly Cannibal rises to his feet. He HEADBUTTS RANDY with the can. Randy, stumbling around, gets headbutted again. Hellbilly Cannibal throws off the can and drags Randy back to the ring by his hair, carrying the ladder in his other hand. 
Plopping Randy down on the mat, Hellbilly Cannibal sets up the ladder in the middle of the ring. He heads back out and grabs the folding table, setting it up by the ladder. He reaches into Randy's Dollar Tree bag and pulls out a BOX OF THUMBTACKS. He scatters the tacks all over the table. 
Hellbilly Cannibal grabs Randy and pulls him up the ladder with him. They stand at the top, perched high above the table. Just as Hellbilly Cannibal is about to push off, Randy surprises him with a VICIOUS HEAD-BUTT. Hellbilly Cannibal is caught totally off guard. Randy headbutts him again. Randy grabs Hellbilly Cannibal and PUSHES OFF. 
In mid-air, Randy does a 180 twist, causing Hellbilly Cannibal to CRASH THROUGH THE TABLE with Randy on top of him. 
Hellbilly Cannibal rolls around the mat in a daze, his back bloodied and covered with tacks. He staggers to his feet. Randy hits him with a dropkick. 
Randy's heartbeat is DEAFENING. All other sounds drop out. 
Randy pulls Hellbilly Cannibal off the mat. As he gears up for another dropkick, his KNEES BUCKLE. A look comes over his face. He DROPS TO HIS KNEES, one hand on the mat. 
Randy grabs his arm. He massages it. He FLOPS OVER, clutching his chest. He lies on his back gasping for breath, sucking at the air. 
RANDY'S POV: The fans are unaware anything is wrong. They assume it's part of the act. 
Hellbilly Cannibal sees a look of FEAR in Randy's eyes. He knows this is real. He looks out at the crowd. 
HELLBILLY CANNIBAL Is there a doctor? 
Few fans look around. Most of them still think this is a gag. 
Among those who sense it's real is JERRY DIFUSCO, the event's promoter. He climbs into the ring. Kneels over Randy. 
JERRY DIFUSCO Randy. You okay? 
RANDY What if I do it moderate? I could hold back on certain moves. There's always ways to fake---- 
DR. TARACHANDANI Mr. Ramovic... 
RANDY (edgy glare) Randy. 
DR. TARACHANDANI Randy, a man with your heart should not be flying around a ring crashing into people. 
Randy's nostrils flare. 
RANDY With all due respect, Dr... (reads name tag, MISPRONOUNCING) ...Trachanani, I'd like a second opinion on that. 
DR. TARACHANDANI Of course. But I promise you, any doctor I showed your file would say the same thing. 
Randy lets out a skeptical, sarcastic snort. 
DR. TARACHANDANI (CONT'D) You almost died. The next time, you won't be so lucky. 
RANDY I want a second opinion. 
DR. TARACHANDANI Your heart's been through a lot. Even before the heart attack, it was significantly---- 
RANDY I want a second opinion. (BEAT) I WANT A SECOND OPINION. 
INT. SUFFOLK COUNTY HOSPITAL - ADMISSIONS DESK - MORNING 
Randy is checking out of the hospital. 
ADMISSIONS-DESK WOMAN This is your copy. 
The ADMISSIONS-DESK WOMAN hands him some paperwork. He folds it up and stuffs it in a pocket. 
ADMISSIONS-DESK WOMAN (CONT'D) This was left for you. 
She hands him a plain white ENVELOPE. Randy opens it. Inside is a NOTE: 
YOU EARNED IT DUDE... YOUR A WARRIOR! REST UP, FEEL BETTER. ----JERRY DIFUSCO PS... IF YOUR UP BY THE 23RD, I GOT SOMETHING IN YONKERS 
Randy looks into the envelope again and pulls out $300. 
He looks at the money, chuckling ironically. It's his biggest payday in years. He tucks it in a pocket. 
ADMISSIONS-DESK WOMAN (CONT'D) You have somebody picking you up? 
RANDY Yeah. 
EXT. SUFFOLK COUNTY HOSPITAL - SHORT TIME LATER 
Randy steps out of the hospital into the bright light of day. He squints, his eyes adjusting. He stands there looking around, a lost animal. 
EXT. NORTH BABYLON COMMUNITY CENTER - PARKING LOT - SHORT TIME LATER 
A CAB pulls up to Randy's van, still parked in the community center's lot. Randy steps out of the cab and limps to the van. He gets in. 
INT. VAN - SHORT TIME LATER 
Randy sits in the van in the otherwise empty lot, pondering his next move. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CVS PHARMACY - SHORT TIME LATER 
Randy roams an aisle, killing time, idly browsing the selection of deodorants. 
WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Robin Ramovic? 
Randy looks up. He heads down the aisle, toward the voice. He comes to the... 
PHARMACY COUNTER: 
A female PHARMACIST stands holding a small pharmacy bag. 
PHARMACIST Robin Ramovic? 
Randy heads toward her. 
PHARMACIST (CONT'D) Is that you? 
He gives her a small, embarrassed nod, taking the bag. 
INT. PARADISE OAKS - MANAGER'S OFFICE - LATER 
Randy hands Len the manager a bunch of cash. Len notices he seems a little off. 
LEN THE MANAGER You alright? 
RANDY Yeah. 
EXT. RANDY'S TRAILER - SHORT TIME LATER 
Len removes the padlock from Randy's trailer door. 
LEN THE MANAGER Welcome home. 
INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - KITCHENETTE - SHORT TIME LATER 
A messy, junk-filled trailer. Randy stands at the kitchen counter with the CVS bag. 
RANDY Don't you wanna get even? I whipped your butt. 
ADAM That's okay. 
Adam gets up and scampers out of the trailer. 
Randy, suddenly alone, looks at the TV. He gazes at the words on the screen: 
1 PLAYER        2 PLAYER 
He selects 1 PLAYER. 
A new match begins. Randy plays without much enthusiasm. After a few halfhearted kicks and punches, he TOSSES THE CONTROLLER ASIDE. 
INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - SHORT TIME LATER 
Randy, standing in the middle of the trailer, does a JUMPING JACK. He does another. A few more. 
He feels himself getting winded. A little woozy. He sits down. He sits still, trying to slow his heart. 
He starts to CRY. 
Angry, bitter, frightened tears roll down his cheeks. 
INT. CHEETAH'S - NIGHT 
Randy enters the club. It's crowded tonight. He looks around for Cassidy. He spots her in a corner offering a CUSTOMER a lapdance. The customer passes. She moves on. 
Randy heads over. She gives him a friendly little cheek peck. 
CASSIDY Hey, sweetie. You're back soon. 
RANDY Ah, I was just in the neighborhood. 
Cassidy nods oh. 
RANDY (CONT'D) ("CASUAL") Hey, feel like maybe grabbing a burger? 
Cassidy finds the offer a little odd. This isn't how they operate. 
CASSIDY I'm working. 
RANDY How `bout later, then? 
She looks at him, puzzled. He seems off. 
CASSIDY You okay? 
RANDY Can we talk for a sec? 
CASSIDY Sure. What's up? 
RANDY Someplace more quiet. 
Randy glances toward the door. Cassidy, catching his drift, looks at him, a little gravely. 
CASSIDY Randy, I can't leave with a customer. 
Pause. 
RANDY I had a heart attack. 
CASSIDY Shit. When? 
RANDY I needed to talk to somebody. 
CASSIDY You can't talk here? 
RANDY Just a couple minutes. 
CASSIDY Randy, I don't do that. 
RANDY Please. 
Cassidy looks at him, torn. She sees the need, the fear in his eyes. 
CASSIDY Where are you parked? 
RANDY In back. 
Another pause of hesitation from Cassidy. This is big. 
CASSIDY Go to your car. I'll meet you out there in 15 minutes. 
EXT. CHEETAH'S - REAR PARKING LOT - 15 MINUTES LATER 
Randy sits in the van, staring at the club's rear EMERGENCY EXIT. Cassidy emerges, a jacket covering her dress. Randy waves. Spotting him, she comes over, climbing in the passenger side. 
RANDY Thanks. I appreciate it. 
CASSIDY That's okay. 
She looks at his vulnerable expression. 
CASSIDY (CONT'D) I'm sorry. That's fucked up, dude. 
Randy nods. 
His cheery expression fades. He is alone again. 
CUT TO: 
INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - DAY 
Randy sits on his bed, sifting through a messy, junk-filled shoebox. He pulls out an OLD PHOTO. 
RANDY'S POV: It's a mid-'80s photo of Randy and his infant daughter Stephanie in front of the family Christmas tree. Randy, wearing a Santa cap, is smiling and laughing, Stephanie perched on his huge, steroid-pumped bicep. 
He flips the photo over. On the back are a bunch of scribbled PHONE NUMBERS. They're all crossed-out except the last one. The numbers get progressively more faded from bottom to top, as if they've been written down over the course of years. 
EXT. PARADISE OAKS - PAY PHONE - SHORT TIME LATER 
Randy stands at a PAY PHONE with the photo, ringing phone cradled to his ear. 
STEPHANIE'S VOICE This is Stephanie, you know what to do. (answering machine BEEP) 
Randy listens to the silence. He hangs up. 
INT. VAN - LATER 
Randy sits in his van by the curb of a modest, lower-middle- class house. He looks at the house, working up the nerve to approach. 
EXT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE - LATER 
Randy stands at the doorstep of the house. Steeling himself, he rings the bell. A WOMAN (22) appears at the door in a T- SHIRT and PANTIES. 
RANDY (a little thrown) Hey... Is Stephanie home? 
The woman looks at Randy a little coldly, sensing who he is. 
THE WOMAN Who can I say it is? 
RANDY Her father. 
She disappears into the house. 
A few moments later, Stephanie emerges with a BACKPACK slung over her shoulder. In her hands is a TEXTBOOK. She heads straight down the driveway, blowing past Randy. 
RANDY (CONT'D) Where you going? 
He goes after her. 
RANDY (CONT'D) Stephanie! 
He catches up. She stops. 
STEPHANIE What do you want? 
RANDY Can we talk? 
STEPHANIE Now's really not a good time. 
She resumes walking, briskly. 
RANDY Wait! (chasing after her) Where ya going? 
He looks at the textbook in her hands: PRINCIPLES OF CHILD DEVELOPMENT. 
RANDY (CONT'D) You in school? That's great. 
She turns DOWN THE SIDEWALK. He continues following. 
RANDY (CONT'D) What school? 
No answer. 
RANDY (CONT'D) What school? 
STEPHANIE Middlesex County Community. 
RANDY Middlesex? That's kind of a hike. Where's your car? (no response) You taking the bus? Lemme give you a lift. 
STEPHANIE That's okay. 
RANDY It's no problem. (BEAT) Really. I'm parked right by. 
Stephanie picks up the pace, trying to lose him. 
RANDY (CONT'D) You're walking pretty fast there. You running late? (no answer) I could help you with that. (no answer) Give you a ride. 
She keeps right on walking. 
RANDY (CONT'D) New Jersey Transit sucks! 
And walking. 
RANDY (O.S.) (CONT'D) The buses smell like piss! 
She fights off an amused smile. She slows a tiny bit. 
INT. VAN - SHORT TIME LATER 
Randy is driving Stephanie. 
STEPHANIE Left at the second stop sign.

RANDY: 
Randy nods vaguely at the flyer, his feelings hard to read. 
RANDY Looks great. 
Brumberg looks around the room as the wrestlers set up shop. 
SCOTT BRUMBERG Should get a pretty good crowd today. 
Randy holds up his hand, wiggling his fingers for Brumberg. 
RANDY I'll start loosening up. 
Brumberg walks off. Randy looks at the flyer again. A sour expression comes over his face. 
INT. GYMNASIUM - SHORT TIME LATER 
The signing is underway. FIVE OR SO FANS mill about the room, drifting from table to table getting autographs and taking photos with the motley assortment of washed-up aging wrestlers. 
ON RANDY: 
Randy is sitting behind his table, signing one of his 8x10s for a FAN. He hands it to the guy, who hands Randy a $5 bill. 
FAN Thanks. 
RANDY You got it, broski. 
The fan walks off. Randy tucks the fiver into the FANNY PACK he's wearing. There's not much in there, just a meager few ones and fives. 
Randy zips up the fanny pack. He looks up, ready to sign more autographs----just as soon as somebody comes over. 
INT. GYMNASIUM - SHORT TIME LATER 
Randy sits at his table, bored. There are NO TAKERS. He looks around the room at the other wrestlers. 
RANDY'S POV: One is asleep. Another looks borderline homeless. Across from him is a 40-SOMETHING WRESTLER in a WHEELCHAIR. Attached to his calf is a URINE BAG. A feeble stream of urine trickles into the bag. 
Randy looks down at the stack of Randy The Ram 8x10s on the table. He gazes numbly at the high-flying image of himself from 20 years earlier. 
SCOTT BRUMBERG (O.S.) Sorry, man. 
Randy looks up and sees Brumberg. 
SCOTT BRUMBERG (CONT'D) I was sure the turnout'd be bigger. 
Randy shrugs resignedly. 
INT. VAN - LATER 
Randy pulls up to his trailer. He sits there with the engine idling, staring at his trailer, scared to go in alone. He pulls back out again. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CHEETAH'S - SHORT TIME LATER 
MUSIC - LIL' KIM - "HOW MANY LICKS?" 
Cassidy, roaming the room, approaches a CUSTOMER sitting near the stafe. She leans in to his ear, her hand on his arm. 
CASSIDY Would you like a lapdance, sweetie? 
CUSTOMER That's okay. 
Cassidy moves along. She approaches a PAIR OF GUYS. She leans in to one of them. 
CASSIDY Would you like a lapdance? 
GUY #1 Not right now. 
She looks toward the other guy. Before she can even ask: 
GUY #2 I'm good. 
Cassidy heads off, rejected. 
RANDY (O.S.) Hey. 
She turns and sees Randy. She's happy to see him after the string of no's. 
CASSIDY Hey. How ya feeling? 
RANDY Better. Good. 
She leads him over to a table. They sit. 
CASSIDY How'd it go with your daughter? 
RANDY Wow... I had no friggin' idea. 
CASSIDY It's not something I usually tell customers. Not exactly a turn-on. 
Randy looks off at something by his van. An idea hits him. 
RANDY Wait. 
He unlocks the door. Leaning into the van, he TEARS THE RANDY THE RAM ACTION FIGURE OFF THE DASHBOARD. He proudly, excitedly holds it out to Cassidy. 
RANDY (CONT'D) Now both our kids got something. 
She looks at the action figure, reluctant to take it. 
RANDY (CONT'D) You're gonna turn this down, too? Man, you're rough! 
Cassidy chuckles a little. She takes it. 
CASSIDY That's very nice of you. Thank you. 
RANDY Tell him to take good care of that. $300 bucks on eBay. 
CASSIDY Really? 
RANDY Nah. 
Cassidy laughs a little. She can't help but be charmed by his sweetness and earnestness. After a pause... 
CASSIDY One beer. 
INT. LOCAL BAR - SHORT TIME LATER 
Randy and Cassidy are having beers at the bar. He's holding her CELLPHONE, looking at PICTURES of her son. He moves on to the next one. 
RANDY He's a good-lookin' kid. 
CASSIDY I think so. 
RANDY I see where he gets it from. 
Cassidy smiles, flattered. 
CASSIDY He sure doesn't get it from his douchebag father. 
Randy skips to the next pic. It's a shot of an UNDER- CONSTRUCTION CONDO BUILDING. 
RANDY What's that? 
CASSIDY Just this condo thing, down by Trenton. 
RANDY You moving there? 
CASSIDY Working on it. (BEAT) It's a great area. Way cheaper. And the schools are awesome. 
RANDY What about Cheetah's? 
CASSIDY I'm done. I'm quitting. 
RANDY (a little disappointed) Oh. (nods to self) Okay... 
MUSIC: DEF LEPPARD - "POUR SOME SUGAR ON ME" 
Randy's ears perk up at the song on the jukebox. 
RANDY (CONT'D) Hell, yeah. 
He stands up, reaching out for Cassidy's hand. She doesn't give it. 
RANDY (CONT'D) C'mon. Let's dance. 
CASSIDY Where? 
RANDY Right here. 
CASSIDY This isn't a dance place. 
RANDY Who cares? Fuckin' Def Lep! 
CASSIDY (CHUCKLES) I've danced to this plenty. 
RANDY Fine. Then I'm dancing for you. 
Randy starts DANCING in front of Cassidy, who's sitting on a barstool. She smiles. 
CASSIDY Is this a lapdance I'm getting? 
Randy goes into lapdance mode, "seductively" writhing for her, silly and self-aware. 
RANDY Just sit back and enjoy. 
He turns around, wiggling his ass a little for her. He runs his hands up and down her sides. He drapes his long blond mane over her shoulders, running it over her face. She laughs, charmed and amused. 
He gazes into her eyes intensely. 
RANDY (CONT'D) The lapdancer has become the lapdanced. 
Cassidy laughs. He continues dancing, totally unembarrassed. 
RANDY You'd hop on my foot and wrap your arms around my leg. I'd have to walk you the whole way through like that. 
STEPHANIE I totally don't remember. 
RANDY (looks at her sweetly) I do. 
EXT. BOARDWALK - SHORT TIME LATER 
Randy and Stephanie sit on a bench facing the ocean eating mint-chocolate chip ice-cream cones. Randy is quiet and contemplative, not in his usual "on" mode. He takes a deep breath. 
RANDY I accept your apology. 
She shoots him an irked look. 
RANDY (CONT'D) Not like that. I just mean... You made amends. I free you. 
Her expression softens. 
RANDY (CONT'D) Anything you've ever done or said or thought, I forgive. You've done nothing wrong to me. And anything I've ever done... (BEAT) I'm sorry. Truly. 
Stephanie is surprised by his emotion and sincerity. 
STEPHANIE Thank you. 
RANDY I was young. My career was booming. All those lights, the fans, the crazy shit on the road... I wasn't thinking about my kid. Or my wife. 
Stephanie nods. 
RANDY (CONT'D) My priorities were all fucked up. I know that. But now... I wanna try to make things right. I wanna try to get to know you. (lump in throat) I just hope it's not too late. 
Randy gazes off at the ocean, filled with fear and love and regret. A tear starts to gather in his eye. He wipes it away before it has a chance to form. 
Stephanie looks at him, moved. 
INT. BOARDWALK ARCADE - SHORT TIME LATER 
Randy and Stephanie play Skee-Ball side-by-side, father and daughter. 
EXT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE - SHORT TIME LATER 
Randy stands with Stephanie in front of her house, dropping her off. 
RANDY Hope that wasn't too painful. 
STEPHANIE It was okay. 
RANDY Well... 
Randy, unsure what to do, extends his hand. 
RANDY (CONT'D) Bye. 
They shake. He pulls her in for a brief, mechanical hug. 
STEPHANIE Bye. 
Another pause. 
RANDY So... How about dinner sometime? 
STEPHANIE Dinner? 
RANDY Maybe Tuesday? 
Stephanie thinks it over. 
STEPHANIE I'm sorry. I don't think so. 
RANDY (nodding, "casual") Or not. That's cool, whatever... 
STEPHANIE Wednesday would work better. 
Randy is surprised and happy. 
INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - LATER 
Randy sticks the old Christmas photo of Stephanie and himself on the fridge. 
EXT. PARADISE OAKS - PAY PHONE - DAY 
Randy stands at the pay phone, ringing phone to his ear. In his hands is his day planner, open to a page marked up with upcoming gigs. 
RANDY Yo, Miggy. Ram. How ya doin'? (BEAT) Good, good. (BEAT) Listen, you're gonna have to count me out for Utica. (momentous pause) I'm retiring. 
EXT. PAY PHONE - MOMENTS LATER 
Another call. 
RANDY Hey, how ya doin', Frank? (BEAT) Good, good. Listen... 
EXT. PAY PHONE - MOMENTS LATER 
Another call. Randy is holding the Fanfest flyer. 
RANDY Sorry, Volp. You know I'd kill to do it. (BEAT) I realize. I understand. (BEAT) No more. I'm done. I'm retired. (BEAT) Positive. It's time to move on. 
INT. CHEETAH'S - NIGHT 
A long, wounded pause from Randy. 
RANDY Yeah. (BEAT) I got it. 
He takes a $20 out of his pocket, holding it out to her. 
CASSIDY What's that for? 
RANDY A lapdance. 
He slides it across the bar to her. She slides it back. 
RANDY (CONT'D) You're refusing a customer? 
He slides the $20 back to her. 
RANDY (CONT'D) Gimme a lapdance. 
She slides it back again. 
RANDY (CONT'D) What? Am I a customer or not? 
He waves the $20 tauntingly in her face. She pushes it away. 
CASSIDY Stop it. 
RANDY What's the matter? (no answer) Not in the mood? (no answer) So fake it. I'm just a stupid customer. 
He tauntingly dangles the $20 in front of her again. 
CASSIDY Stop. 
RANDY It doesn't mean anything. 
She looks away, trying to ignore him. 
RANDY (CONT'D) C'mon, give the customer a lapdance. Shake your tits. Smile. 
CASSIDY Fuck off. 
RANDY Pretend you like him. 
CASSIDY Fuck off. 
RANDY I want a lapdance. 
She SWATS HIS HAND. The $20 falls to the floor. He picks it up and SLAMS IT on the bar. 
RANDY (CONT'D) I WANT A LAPDANCE! 
People turn and stare. Randy storms out of the club, humiliated. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SHOP-RITE - DELI COUNTER - DAY 
About 10 CUSTOMERS hover in front of the DELI COUNTER clutching Take-A-Number tickets. Randy, manning the counter with a COWORKER, hands a WOMAN a packet of roast beef. 
RANDY Can I help who's next? 
An OLD LADY steps forward. 
OLD LADY Pound of German potato salad, please. 
Randy grabs a container and starts scooping potato salad. He puts the container on the scale. It reads 1.06 LB. 
OLD LADY (CONT'D) A little less. 
Randy scoops out a little and weighs it again. The scale reads .96 LB. 
OLD LADY (CONT'D) A little more. 
Randy puts a little more in. The scale reads 1.03. 
OLD LADY (CONT'D) A little less. 
Randy, trying to contain his aggravation, takes a tiny bit out. The scale reads 1.00. The lady nods in approval. 
Randy slaps a price sticker on the container and hands it across the counter. 
RANDY Have a nice day. 
She shuffles off with her potato salad. 
RANDY (CONT'D) Can I help who's next? 
A BLUE-COLLAR GUY (40s) steps forward. 
CUSTOMER Yeah, could I get a... 
The guy does a DOUBLE-TAKE, noticing Randy's face. 
CUSTOMER (CONT'D) Do I know you from somewhere? 
RANDY I don't think so. 
The guy studies Randy's face, trying hard to place it. 
Randy scoops up his opponent again and SLAMS HIM TO THE MAT with another fancy move. 
RANDY (CONT'D) Powerbomb! 
The song reaches its frenzied, chant-like CHORUS: 
GUNS `N' ROSES Get in the ring! Get in the ring! Get in the ring! Get in the ring! 
Randy joins in, pumping his fist. 
RANDY Get in the ring! Get in the ring! Get in the ring! Get in the ring! 
CUT TO: 
INT. NINTH INNING COLLECTIBLES - DAY 
A strip-mall sports-card/comic-book shop. Tacked to the wall by the entrance are FLYERS for various events----card shows, autograph signings, etc. 
Behind the counter is promoter Scott Brumberg, scarfing down a sloppy Subway sub. The door opens. He looks up, smiling. 
SCOTT BRUMBERG Ram! 
Randy heads over and gives him a warm hello handclasp. 
RANDY Yo, Brummy. 
Brumberg pulls him in for a hug. 
SCOTT BRUMBERG How's tricks? Good to see ya, man. 
RANDY Yeah, good, good. 
SCOTT BRUMBERG So what brings ya by? 
RANDY Well... I was thinking about maybe doing a reffing gig. 
SCOTT BRUMBERG I thought you're retired. 
RANDY No wrestling, just reffing. Thought it might be fun. Shits `n' giggles. 
Brumberg, nodding, reaches down and grabs out a beat-up SPIRAL NOTEBOOK with old event flyers sticking out. 
SCOTT BRUMBERG See what we got... 
CUT TO: 
INT. BRIDGEPORT NORTH HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - LATER 
A high-school cafeteria. Randy is slipping into a REFEREE UNIFORM. Along the wall hangs a vinyl banner reading CAPW - CONNECTICUT ALL-PRO WRESTLING. 
BOOKER D (O.S.) Randy The Ref! 
Randy looks up and sees BOOKER D (30s), a big, black wrestler in FULL PIMP REGALIA. Though not a pro like Randy, he's upper- tier indie circuit. Randy gives him a grin and handshake. 
RANDY `Sup, bro? 
BOOKER D Me and McPride was going over spots. We got this dope idea how to work you in. 
RANDY I really ain't lookin' to mix it up tonight. 
BOOKER D You're gonna love this. Check it out. So McPride---- 
RANDY That's okay. You guys do your thing. 
Booker D looks at him, surprised and puzzled. 
HARD CUT TO: 
INT. BRIDGEPORT NORTH H.S. - GYMNASIUM - SHORT TIME LATER 
Booker D lands on opponent SHAWN MCPRIDE with a BIG SUPLEX. He falls on top of McPride for the pin. Randy The Ref smacks the mat, counting. 
RANDY One!... Two!... 
McPride kicks out. Booker D lifts up McPride. He hits him with a CHEST CHOP, sending him stumbling backwards into the ropes. Booker D goes after him. 
CAMERA STAYS ON RANDY'S FACE as he watches them wrestle off- screen. 
Randy's eyes are glued to the action... Punches. Kicks. Suplexes. Bodyslams. The crowd is going crazy. 
He is tempted. Salivating almost. 
More punches. More cheers. Bodies crash loudly against the mat. Randy's temptation grows with each shot. He can't resist any longer. He... 
JUMPS IN. 
Randy pushes Booker D out of the way. He's SMASHED IN THE FACE by a McPride-swung folding chair meant for Booker D. 
Randy goes down. A TRACE OF A SMILE is visible on his face. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BOYS' LOCKER ROOM - SHOWER AREA - POST-MATCH 
Randy, Booker D, and McPride are SHOWERING in the open shower area. They're on a post-match high. 
BOOKER D What a screwjob. 
Randy turns and sees a shocked Wayne rushing toward him. Wayne takes Randy's arm and tries to lead him into the back, out of view. 
WAYNE (CONT'D) (conscious of customers WATCHING) Let's get that patched up. 
Randy roughly SHOVES him away. Wayne stumbles backwards. 
Randy, turning toward the onlookers, raises his thumb to his face. He dramatically smears the BLOOD ACROSS HIS MOUTH. 
Customers GASP. A woman SHRIEKS. 
Randy drags the gash across his cheek. He SMEARS A LINE OF IT under each eye like WARPAINT. 
RANDY (striking wrestling pose) Let's get it onnn! 
WAYNE Somebody call the cops! 
Randy ROARS at Wayne. Wayne JUMPS BACK, frightened. Randy rumbles out of the deli area LAUGHING. 
SUPERMARKET AISLE: 
Randy dashes down an aisle. He dodges a WOMAN PUSHING A SHOPPING CART, purposely "over-dodging" her so he CRASHES INTO THE SHELVES and sends stuff flying. He dodges ANOTHER SHOPPER, dramatically crashing into the shelves again. 
FRONT REGISTER AREA: 
Randy charges past the CASHIERS, out of the supermarket. 
INT. VAN - SHORT TIME LATER 
Randy sits in the van in the Shop-Rite parking lot. He gazes at himself in the rear-view mirror, dried blood caked on his face. 
He likes it. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. PARADISE OAKS - PAY PHONE - LATER 
Randy is on the pay phone. 
RANDY Nick. Randy The Ram... (BEAT) I wanna do it. (BEAT) Fanfest. (BEAT) I know, but I want back in. (BEAT) So call Bob, get the match back on. (BEAT) Pay me? Don't worry. Just cover my expenses. And pay Bob. Make sure he's there. (BEAT) I don't give a shit. I just wanna wrestle. 
INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - DAY 
Randy is digging through a pile of clothes in a closet. He pulls out his WRESTLING TIGHTS. 
INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - BATHROOM - LATER 
Randy, wearing rubber gloves and a towel around his neck, combs PEROXIDE through his hair. 
INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - BATHROOM - LATER 
Randy is SHAVING HIS CHEST. The hair has grown in since he last wrestled. 
INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - LATER 
Randy stands in the middle of the trailer in just a pair of bikini briefs. In his hands is a product called TAN IN A CAN. He gives the can a good shake and starts spraying his body. 
INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - SHORT TIME LATER 
Randy puts a snacks-and-soda-filled plastic bag in the front of the van. He is surprised to see Cassidy pull up in her car. She gets out. 
CASSIDY Hi. 
RANDY How'd you find me? 
CASSIDY Big Chris. Cheetah's bouncer. 
Randy nods oh. 
CASSIDY (CONT'D) Look, I'm sorry if I came off like a bitch. I didn't mean that stuff I said. You're not just a customer. 
Randy nods. He heads toward his trailer. Cassidy follows. 
CASSIDY (CONT'D) I'm sure it seems retarded, but I gotta keep that line. It's how I've been able to live with myself the last 12 years. 
INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - CONTINUOUS 
Randy enters the trailer, Cassidy close behind. 
CASSIDY There's a place I'm trying to get to in my life. For me and my son. 
Randy heads to his wheelie bag, open on the bed. 
CASSIDY (CONT'D) I'm leaving that world behind. And I can't bring anybody with me who---- 
RANDY (doesn't really care) Good for you. Quitting's hard. 
He zips up his bag. Walks outside toward his van. She follows. 
CASSIDY Where are you going? 
EXT. RANDY'S TRAILER - CONTINUOUS 
He gets in the van. 
RANDY Got a match. 
He grabs the Fanfest flyer off the passenger seat and hands it to her. 
RANDY'S POV: A huge, dark-skinned man in khakis and a BOB ZAYID PONTIAC polo is talking to SOME OTHER WRESTLER. This is THE AYATOLLAH (52). 
THE AYATOLLAH That makes two in Columbus, one in Dayton. Next 12 months, I'd say Cincy's not out of the question. 
OTHER WRESTLER (not too interested) Wow... 
The Ayatollah looks up and sees Randy looking at him. 
THE AYATOLLAH Ram-A-Lam. 
Randy heads over. 
RANDY (shakes Ayatollah's hand) What's up, Bob? (shakes other guy's hand) Yo, Carl. 
THE AYATOLLAH Good to see ya, bro. Didn't think we were gonna do this. 
RANDY Yeah, well, I'm here. 
THE AYATOLLAH Thursday night, I get a call, "It's on! He's back in!" I'm like "What?" 
The Ayatollah chortles. 
RANDY When you get settled in, we should go over things. 
THE AYATOLLAH What things? 
RANDY Y'know, the spots. 
THE AYATOLLAH Ah, we can just wing it. 
RANDY You don't wanna hash it out? 
The Ayatollah gives him a dismissive, cavalier wave. 
THE AYATOLLAH It'll be fine. 
RANDY We should have at least a basic plan. 
THE AYATOLLAH How's this: I'm the heel, you're the face. Done. 
The Ayatollah chuckles. Randy walks off, highly annoyed. 
THE AYATOLLAH (O.S.) (CONT'D) (to other wrestler) Anyway, if you're ever in Ohio, swing on by. I'll make you a nice deal on a G6. 
INT. GAS STATION - SHORT TIME LATER 
Cassidy pulls into a gas station. She rolls down the window. 
CASSIDY Excuse me. 
A GAS STATION ATTENDANT looks her way. 
CASSIDY (CONT'D) Do you know where the Civic Auditorium is? 
INT. GREENVILLE CIVIC AUDITORIUM - LOCKER ROOM - LATER 
The card is underway. Through a wall, we hear the muffled sounds of a MATCH IN PROGRESS: cheers, boos, crashes, etc. 
Randy, sitting alone on a bench in just his jock strap, tapes up his legs. His focus and intensity builds. 
EXT. GREENVILLE CIVIC AUDITORIUM - PARKING LOT - SHORT TIME LATER 
Cassidy pulls into the lot. There's a lot more cars than when Randy pulled in. 
INT. GREENVILLE CIVIC AUDITORIUM - OUTER CONCOURSE - SHORT TIME LATER 
The building's outer concourse. A handful of fans mill about at a CONCESSIONS STAND and a SOUVENIR TABLE. 
Cassidy, handing a ticket to an USHER, enters the building. She looks around the concourse, not quite sure where to go. 
INT. LOCKER ROOM - LATER 
Randy, suited up in his tights, paces the floor, gearing himself up for the match. The only other wrestler in the locker room at the moment is The Ayatollah, doing neck rolls nearby. Randy catches his eyes. 
RANDY Ready to do this? 
Through the wall, ARABIC MUSIC starts to play. 
THE AYATOLLAH Believe so. 
The Ayatollah grabs a large IRANIAN FLAG leaning against the lockers. He heads toward an ENTRANCE CURTAIN, Randy close behind. 
ANNOUNCER (O.S.) (through curtain) From the Islamic Republic of Iran, weighing in at 252 pounds... The Tehran Terror, the Beast Of The Middle East... (BEAT) The Ayaaa-tooo-laaaaaah! 
The Ayatollah steps through the curtain, Iranian flag raised high. He is promptly greeted with LUSTY BOOS. 
INT. OUTER CONCOURSE - CONTINUOUS 
Cassidy is walking around the concourse with a mounting sense urgency. She spots a SECURITY GUY in a yellow windbreaker sitting by an UNMARKED DOOR. She heads toward him. 
CASSIDY Excuse me. 
INT. LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Randy is peering through the narrow gap in the curtain, watching The Ayatollah make his entrance. 
THE AYATOLLAH (O.S.) (faint, amidst the boos) Death to America! 
Randy lowers the mike, finished. The fans CHEER WILDLY, the loudest cheers yet. 
As Randy nods appreciatively at the crowd, The Ayatollah SNEAKS UP BEHIND HIM with a folding chair. 
Fans shout, trying to warn Randy about the sneak attack, but he doesn't hear them. 
The Ayatollah SMASHES HIM OVER THE HEAD. Randy goes down. The match is on. 
The Ayatollah picks up Randy and throws him into the ropes. Randy bounces back toward The Ayatollah, who lazily puts up an elbow for Randy to run into. Randy practically has to lead his face to the elbow. Hitting the mat, Randy pops back up and grabs The Ayatollah. 
The Ayatollah, phoning it in, throws Randy into the ropes again. This time, The Ayatollah has a raised knee waiting for Randy. Randy runs into it, doing his best to sell the shot. 
RANDY (CONT'D) (under breath) You're workin' pretty light here. 
Randy gets up and grabs The Ayatollah's arms. With a nifty move, he flips The Ayatollah over his shoulder, SLAMMING HIM HARD into the mat. Randy falls on top of him, pressing The Ayatollah's face into the canvas. 
THE AYATOLLAH Jesus. Relax. 
Randy flips The Ayatollah over onto his back, pinning his shoulder blades. The REF swoops in. 
REFEREE One!... Two!... 
The Ayatollah KICKS OUT. They both get up. The Ayatollah jogs toward the ropes. He bounces off. Randy braces for something good, but all he gets is a feeble CHEST SLAP. Randy grabs The Ayatollah and puts him in a headlock. 
RANDY Anytime you wanna join in. 
Randy scoops up The Ayatollah and drops him over his knee with a BACKBREAKER. The Ayatollah grimaces in pain as he hits the mat. Before he has a chance to get up, Randy hits him with a FLYING ELBOW DROP. 
The Ayatollah gets up, pissed at the rough treatment. 
Randy goes for a dropkick, but The Ayatollah catches his ankles in midair. He JERKS UPWARD on Randy's legs, sending Randy CRASHING TO THE MAT on the back of his head. The Ayatollah falls on Randy's throat with his knee. He grinds Randy's face into the canvas as Randy did to him. 
ENTRANCE CURTAIN: 
Cassidy is cringing. It's hard for her to watch this. 
THE RING: 
THE AYATOLLAH That better? 
RANDY Much. 
The Ayatollah picks up Randy and throws him into the ropes. Randy bounces back, flinging himself sideways at The Ayatollah. The Ayatollah catches him in mid-air, cradling him in his arms. The Ayatollah drops Randy onto his bent knee. Randy falls to the canvas, clutching his side. The Ayatollah falls on top of him. 
THE AYATOLLAH Forgot how much fun this is. 
The ref swoops in. 
REFEREE One!... Two!... 
Randy KICKS OUT. As Randy "recovers", The Ayatollah jumps out of the ring and grabs a folding chair. 
The Ayatollah, climbing back in, props up the chair in a corner. He picks Randy off the mat and flings him at the chair. Randy VAULTS OVER IT, sailing through the ropes and OUT OF THE RING. He hits the concrete floor, CRASHING against the metal barricade. 
ENTRANCE CURTAIN: 
Cassidy winces. She starts to tear up a little. 
THE RING: 
The Ayatollah hops out of the ring. He stands over Randy, kicking him repeatedly. He grabs his Iranian flag, waving it tauntingly at the crowd. 
FAN #1 (O.S.)                      FAN #2 (O.S.) Camelfucker!                       Fat piece of shit! 
The Ayatollah looks down at Randy. 
THE AYATOLLAH Pathetic. ("spits" on Randy) Pitiful godless infidel! 
THE CROWD: 
Boos rain down on The Ayatollah. 
JUST OUTSIDE RING: 
The Ayatollah takes the butt end of his flag pole and JABS IT into Randy's side. Randy grimaces in pain. 
The Ayatollah unties the flag from its pole and WRAPS IT around Randy's neck. He JERKS UPWARD on the flag, lifting Randy off the mat by his neck. Randy THRASHES AROUND, fighting for breath. 
The Ayatollah releases Randy from the choke. Randy crumples to the ground, gasping for air. The Ayatollah picks up Randy by his hair and flings him back in the ring. 
THE RING: 
The Ayatollah grabs the folding chair from the corner. He SMASHES RANDY OVER THE HEAD with it. Randy's forehead is BLEEDING. The Ayatollah hits him again, taking dead aim at the forehead cut. MORE BLOOD. Randy crumples to the mat. 
ENTRANCE CURTAIN: 
Cassidy, alarmed, instinctively goes halfway toward the ring. 
CASSIDY Randy! 
THE RING: 
The Ayatollah scoops up Randy and BODYSLAMS him. He falls on Randy knee-first and starts punching him repeatedly. 
THE AYATOLLAH (under breath) Wanna take it home? 
Randy's eyes drift in Cassidy's direction.

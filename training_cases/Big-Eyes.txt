BIG EYES 
Written by 
Scott Alexander & Larry Karaszewski 
FADE IN: 
TITLE SEQUENCE: 
TIGHT on TWO PAINTED EYES. The pupils are impossibly wide. Imploring. The watery rims spill a single tear. We PULL OUT... revealing the eyes belong to a child. A young girl, fingers clasped pitifully. She's forlorn, alone in a dirty gray alley. We feel shame. Compassion. Sorrow... Then -- an IDENTICAL girl SLAPS in front of the first one. Then another! It's a PRINTING PRESS, the creation of a BLUR of sad children. 
A KINETIC montage! HORDES of gazing WAIFS get lithographed, bundled: Huddling in worry. Floating in space. POSTERS. 
POSTCARDS. BOOKS. We ZOOM into a MAGAZINE AD: A 1960's era come-on -- "IT'S 
KEANE! MUSEUM-QUALITY ART, MAILED DIRECTLY TO YOUR HOME!" A blizzard of NEWSPAPER ARTICLES: "Meet America's Million- Dollar Painter!" "Keane Masterpiece at World's Fair" Painted EYES float by. Haunting... questioning... Old POLAROIDS: A family Christmas, a Keane print over the mantel. Kids play bumper pool, a Keane print in the b.g. A blurry black-and-white TV: A talk show HOST holds up a Keane 
PAINTING -- MUSIC BUILDS. FASTER. Keane brochures. Catalogs. A flyer: "Now Open! Keane Gallery" MORE orphan's faces. Hungry, unblinking, beseeching. A CRESCENDO -- then -- SILENCE. 
A single CARD on black: "I think what Keane has done is just terrific. It has to be good. If it were bad, so many people wouldn't like it."

CUT TO: 
EXT. SUBURBIA - 1958 
A nice, orderly tract of post-World War II housing. Identical rows of little yards. Young MOMS. Scampering KIDS. Then, a SUBTITLE: "TEN YEARS EARLIER" 
INT. HOUSE - DAY 
CU on two concerned eyes. The same eyes as the paintings. We REVEAL they belong to a real girl: JANE, 8. She sits in her small house -- a typical young family's, spare and underfurnished. 
Suddenly -- Jane's mother MARGARET ULBRICH, 28, rushes through frame. Margaret is blonde, yearning, fragile. Terribly upset, she is hurriedly packing. Margaret throws her clothes in a suitcase. She shoves Jane's clothes and toys into another. Margaret barrels through the breakfast nook, which is a mini art studio -- easel, canvases, paints. She scoops up her supplies. 
Margaret runs to the door -- then turns. The hallway is lined with her PAINTINGS. Oils and inks of wide-eyed Jane, who grows from baby to toddler to child. Hastily, Margaret takes them down, each frame leaving an empty mark on the flowered wallpaper. Finally she reaches the last spot -- a WEDDING PHOTO: Margaret and her HUSBAND, smiling, happy. Margaret peers -- then leaves it hanging. The door SLAMS. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY 
Cars roar down an interstate. 
INT. PACKARD - DRIVING - DAY 
Margaret grips the wheel, uncertain. Jane stares. The car is all loaded up. REFLECTIONS of passing BILLBOARDS drift across the windshield. Images of perky, happy-fake Americans. Margaret bites her lip. Has she made the right decision...? 
CUT TO: 
EST. SAN FRANCISCO - DAY San Francisco, 1958! A mix of SKYLINES and STOCK FOOTAGE. 
EXT. FURNITURE FACTORY - DAY 
A weathered building: "G & B FURNITURE SUPPLY." Margaret sits in the Packard, fixing her lipstick. Jane holds the "WANT ADS," a few circled. Margaret gets out and straightens her skirt. Jane smiles. 
JANE Good luck. 
INT. FURNITURE FACTORY - DAY 
A beaten industrial office. Margaret sits anxiously, watching the BOSS, a tired guy in a cheap suit. He glowers unsurely at her JOB APPLICATION. Scratching his face. Hmmmm... 
BOSS We don't get many ladies in here. So your husband approves of you working? 
MARGARET (quiet; a soft Southern lilt) My husband and I are separated. 
BOSS 
(SHOCKED) "Separated"? A deadly silence. He squirms uncomfortably. She presses on. 
TOURIST GUY I'll give you one. Beat -- then she nods, agreeing. She gestures. The little BOY sits. Margaret clips a fresh sheet of paper, sharpens her charcoal... and... goes motionless. Studying the boy's face. He gazes back. Then -- inspired, she begins sketching his EYES. Large and exaggerated. Then she fills in the shape of his head. His ears. His jaw. In a rush, his likeness appears. The parents come over to peek -- then gasp. Margaret is good. She sketches faster. Focused. Until a LOUD, PLUMMY VOICE drifts in... 
MAN'S VOICE Monet? "Monet"?! Whew -- that's a hell of a compliment. Though, if I may respectfully disagree, I'm more in the tradition of Pissarro. Margaret looks up, distracted. She resumes her work. 
MAN'S VOICE C'mon, get closer. Closer! Look at that sunlight coming through the mottled leaves. That's a bold yellow! Curious, Margaret casually peers over... 
HER POV Holding court in another booth is WALTER KEANE, 40. Walter is astonishing: Hugely confident. Charming. Waggishly handsome. And dressed like an "Artist" -- striped turtleneck, with hands full of brushes. Walter's stall is filled with oils of Paris street scenes. He casually flirts with TWO YOUNG COEDS. They admire a painting. 
WALTER You wanna touch it? Do it! I lay it on thick -- you're not gonna break it! 
(UNWAVERING) I poured myself into that painting. It's thirty-five dollars. 
Walter glances over -- and notices Margaret watching him. Shy, she quickly turns away, back to her portrait. Walter smiles rakishly. He's found a new interest. 
WALTER Excuse me, Ladies. 
WIDE Walter strides up to Margaret. She peers nervously... trying to ignore him. She sketches faster. Shading... Walter watches. Admiring... and discreetly smelling her hair. Margaret pays no attention. Done, she blows into a can of Fix- It. Poosh! A fine mist sprays, setting the portrait. Without fanfare, she humbly turns the picture. 
MARGARET All finished. Her customers gape, impressed. She smiles. The guy counts out four quarters, then happily leaves. 
MARGARET AND WALTER are left together. An unspoken frisson, until -- 
WALTER You're better than spare change. You shouldn't sell yourself so cheap. 
MARGARET I'm just glad they liked it. 
WALTER Ahhh! You're past that point! Your heart is in your work... He leans in, too close. Margaret shivers. Breathing faster. 
WALTER What's your name? 
MARGARET M-Margaret... Mmm. He grins, checking her out... her loose sexy blouse and tight black capris. She flushes. 
MARGARET Wouldn't you rather flirt with those dolls over there? 
WALTER Mm, no. 
(BEAT) I like you, Margaret... He zeroes in on the artworks' signature: "M. Ulbrich" 
WALTER "...Ulbrich." 
(IMPASSIONED) You know, Margaret Ulbrich, you're undervaluing yourself. Lemme show you how it's done. Walter spins to Jane. He SHOUTS out, like a carnival barker. 
WALTER Little Girl! How would you like your portrait sketched by the World- Renowned Margaret Ulbrich?! Queen of the Bay! In mere minutes, she will capture your soul! Hm. Jane shrugs, unimpressed. 
JANE Nah. 
WALTER "Nah"?! (he grabs a PAINTING) Don't you wish this were you in this beautiful painting?? 
JANE But that IS me! And that's me... (she POINTS all over) And that one started as me, but then Mother turned it into a Chinese boy. Huh? Walter peers at Jane... then at Margaret. And then -- it hits him. He grimaces, embarrassed. 
WALTER Oh, you're Mommy! My apologies, Honey. I misconstrued the situation. 
(SHEEPISH) Well I'll just mosey along, before Mr. Ulbrich comes back and socks me in the eye. 
ON MARGARET A gut decision. She stares at Walter, then smiles slyly. 
MARGARET Mr. Ulbrich is out of the picture...! 
ON WALTER His face slowly lights up. Ah! Sun breaking through clouds.

EST. FRENCH BISTRO - NIGHT 
INT. BISTRO - NIGHT 
An enchanting bistro. Wine barrels, laughing, twinkly tivoli lights. Perfection. Walter flamboyantly enters, escorting Margaret. Instantly, the STAFF ERUPTS in excitement: "Monsieur Keane! Ah, Monsieur Keane is here! Bonsoir!" 
WALTER Bonsoir, gang! Henri! Sorry I didn't call first. Est-ce que tout va bien? 
RUBEN Oh definitely! Strongly influenced by the tachistes. 
FANCY LADY I heard Tab Hunter was in here, looking at one. 
RUBEN Well... I'm not allowed to say... He NODS HIS HEAD up-and-down: Yes, you're right. 
OUTSIDE A car backfires. Ruben turns -- and winces. 
Through the windows is Walter, climbing out of his massive white Cadillac. He's all done up, in beret and scarf. He opens the giant trunk and removes a pile of paintings. Ruben cringes knowingly. He whispers: 
RUBEN Oh Christ, don't come in here. Please don't come in here... The door SLAMS. Walter loudly barges in. 
WALTER Ruben, good day! Do you got a minute? 
RUBEN Walter. In polite society, the word is "appointment." 
FANCY LADY (glancing back and forth) Uh, I could come back later... She anxiously hurries for the door. Ruben fumes. Walter ignores it all and starts laying out his wares. First, the Parisian street scenes, one after another... 
WALTER You're gonna love my stuff today. 
RUBEN Haven't I seen that one before? 
WALTER Nah! That was painted in the Fifth Arrondissement. This is the Sixth Arrondissement! 
RUBEN 
(SKEPTICAL) I don't understand. You lived in Paris for a week. How can you still be cranking out paintings? Walter laughs. He points to his head. 
WALTER It's all up here. (beat; a sentimental 
FLOURISH) And here. He points to his heart. Ruben frowns and points to the wall. 
RUBEN Well, it's not going up here. 
(CRUEL) Walter, you know we don't go for that representational jazz! You're too literal. 
WALTER 
(HURT) Hey, Art isn't fashion! 
RUBEN Yes it IS! 
(CUTTING) People want Kandinsky, or Rothko! They don't want goopy street scenes. 
CLOSEUP - WALTER Ouch! This stings terribly. Walter glares at the man, then softly slides aside his works. Quietly, he pulls out Margaret's Big Eye paintings. 
WALTER Would they want... this? 
RUBEN 
(HE SHUDDERS) Good God! You've entered a new period. 
WALTER No... they're my wife's. Fascinated, Ruben glances through Margaret's oils. Canvas after canvas of sad kiddies against gray, bleak backgrounds. 
RUBEN Why are their eyes so big?! They're like big stale jellybeans. 
WALTER 
(SNIDE) It's Expressionism. Surely you recognize it. 
RUBEN 
(LONG BEAT) Well -- I'm just glad you two found each other. 
WALTER So... what do you say? Ruben looks up, amazed. Walter seems oblivious. 
RUBEN I say, NO! It's not art. 
WALTER 
TIPSY LADY Look at that child. She's so sad. 
TIPSY MAN Is she poor..? 
TIPSY LADY She's forgotten! It just makes me want to cry. (she peers at the signature, then turns) Are you "Keane"? Walter lifts his head from the table. 
WALTER Yeah. 
TIPSY LADY Well you're a hell of a painter. Walter squints, confused, then beams. Joy! Happiness bursting like a little child. 
WALTER Why, thank you...! Thank you so much! 
TIPSY LADY Your work is very powerful. There's so much emotion in those eyes. OUCH! Walter's smile collapses. 
TIPSY LADY Is something wrong? 
WALTER 
(REELING) Huh? Uh... no. No. I just didn't realize you meant... the waif. 
TIPSY MAN (beat; he CHUCKLES) Oh, I get it...! The artist doesn't wanna part with his favorite piece... The man winks, then pulls out a WAD OF BILLS. Walter stares morosely. 
INT. HUNGRY I - LATER 
Walter sits at the bar, toasted, drinking. In a dark place. His misery is interrupted by happy Banducci, groping two GALS. 
BANDUCCI Hello, Picasso! Nice crowd, eh? 
WALTER 
(SOUR) You wouldn't know it from that broom closet you parked me in. 
BANDUCCI Hey, it's prime thoroughfare! People drink, they gotta relieve themselves. 
WALTER 
(MUTTERING) "Location, location, location..." Walter wallows in self-loathing. Suddenly, he explodes. 
WALTER It's INSULTING! When people see art, they shouldn't think of SHIT! 
BANDUCCI 
(SHOCKED) Whoah! Watch it with the purple language. We got ladies present --! Banducci PUSHES Walter away. 
In reaction, Walter sloppily SMACKS him. Riled, Banducci suddenly takes a SWING! Walter stumbles, and Banducci's punch accidently HITS the GIRL. Ow! She topples. Walter gasps. He SWATS Banducci -- then RUNS! Cameras FLASH. Wild whoops. Walter barrels down the hall, Banducci chasing. The brawl's gone nuts. Walter grabs a Waif and SMASHES it over Banducci's head. CRASH! Banducci drops. 
CUT TO: 
INSERT - SAN FRANCISCO EXAMINER The front page! A small headline says "BISTRO BRAWL: BANDUCCI AND ARTIST SLUGFEST." Below are two PHOTOS: Walter mid-punch, and Banducci unconscious, sticking out of the Big Eye. 
EXT. POLICE STATION - DAWN 
A neighborhood precinct, quiet at 6 a.m. Doors open, and Margaret leads Walter out. She's seething. He's bruised, with a mortified drunk-tank, slept-in-my-clothes swagger. 
MARGARET I've never posted bail before. Silence. He has no idea what to say. His aplomb crumbles. 
WALTER I'm -- I'm sorry. Banducci... laughed at our work. ...So I socked him. 
MARGARET Since when are you thin-skinned? Artists have to handle criticism. 
WALTER You're right! I know. But... I was already in a bad place. I'd had a couple... and earlier... 
(PAUSE) I let some guy think I painted your Big Eye. Beat. Margaret is stupefied. 
MARGARET I don't understand. Why would you do such a thing?! 
WALTER It was a misunderstanding. And then, I didn't want to jinx the sale. 
He shrugs feebly. She frowns. 
INT. HUNGRY I - NIGHT 
Walter sells Big Eyes. Shoving cash into a cigar box. 
INT. APARTMENT - DAY 
Margaret works, HUMMING serenely. On the easel is a half- finished blonde girl in a blue dress. 
INT. TAILOR'S - DAY 
Walter buys a new suit. A TAILOR measures him. 
INT. APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT 
Margaret finishes painting a sad boy, using a fine brush to add a watery rim to his eyes. Magically, this detail brings the picture to life. She's pleased. Margaret signs "KEANE." There are two finished canvases, the sad little girl and boy. Margaret smiles, her heart swelling. She loves them. Then, she looks about. Nobody is there to share the moment. Hm. She thinks -- then picks up the PHONE. She dials. 
MARGARET Mrs. Cava, I'm sorry to bother you so late... but would you mind watching Jane? 
INT. TAXI - NIGHT 
Margaret rides in the back seat, smiling, her gaze faraway. She proudly hugs the bundled paintings to her chest. 
INT. HUNGRY I - NIGHT 
The club is pounding. Margaret enters the throng, carrying her work. She looks up -- and has her breath taken away. The 
ENTIRE CLUB, EVERY WALL, IS NOW HUNG WITH KEANE PAINTINGS! Whoa...! Pure joy envelops her. Then -- she gets jostled. Margaret notices Walter holding court with some GROUPIES. She approaches, unnoticed: 
WALTER ...yeah, eyes are powerful. A poet said they're the windows of the soul. Margaret smiles, touched. She comes closer.... 
GROUPIE They hold so much feeling. 
WALTER You got it! That's why I paint 'em so big. 
(BEAT) I've always done it that way. 
CLOSEUP - MARGARET She GASPS, stunned. The room starts spinning. 
HER POV 
WALTER If you like this style, I'm working on a few new pieces. I've got a little blonde girl in a blue dress that'll tear your heart out. 
ANGLE - MARGARET Her face goes ashen. Dizzy, she clutches for support. What to do?? Overcome, she shrinks away... disappearing... ending up alone in a corner. She cowers, childlike. 
ACROSS THE ROOM Walter LAUGHS at a joke, then backslaps the group. He jovially strides away... passing by Margaret... when -- 
MARGARET Walter...? He spins -- shocked at her presence. 
WALTER Baby! 
(DISCOMBOBULATED) Hey, uh, what are you doing here? I 
UM -- 
MARGARET Why are you lying? For once, Walter has no answer. She bores in, emotions racing. Confused. Hurt. 
MARGARET You're taking credit for something that isn't yours. He looks ill. Wheels spinning, looking for an out -- 
WALTER I was... trying to close the deal -- 
MARGARET Those children are part of my being! 
WALTER I'm just a salesman! You know, buyers pay more if they meet the painter -- 
MARGARET They couldn't meet me, because you told me to stay home!! 
WALTER Shh, QUIET! He grabs her, pulling her behind a curtain. He's desperate. 
WALTER Don't blow this! Look, we're makin' money! Your pocket, my pocket? What's the difference?! 
MARGARET Well... he's more established. 
DEE-ANN Please! Is that you talking, or did you just turn into a little felt puppet with someone's hand up your ass? Margaret is befuddled. Dee-Ann scopes out the artwork. 
DEE-ANN It's strange... Walter doesn't strike me as the cute hungry kitten type... Margaret grimaces. 
MARGARET Thanks for coming. Margaret grabs a drink and hurries away. Dee-Ann stands there, irked. Margaret cuts over to Walter. We MOVE IN TIGHT ON THE COUPLE. He grins and grabs her. 
WALTER Ah, my sweet! Are you enjoying the scene? (he gives her a kiss) 
EVERYONE! 
(MORE) 
WALTER (CONT'D) Give a hand to my beautiful wife. Without her, none of tonight would be possible! The crowd APPLAUDS politely, condescendingly. Margaret smiles strangely. The Tipsy Man leans in. 
TIPSY MAN Your husband's quite a talent. 
(PLEASANT) Do you paint, too? Margaret freezes up, terribly awkward. 
MARGARET I don't... know. 
AT WALTER A NOSY GUY corners him in front of a painted child. 
NOSY GUY I'm curious about your technique. How long did that piece take to execute? 
WALTER That? Oh, wow. Probably... months. First the thinking, the sketching, and then time with just me and the oils. 
NOSY GUY "Oils"? But isn't that acrylic...? Huh? Walter glances at the painting, startled. 
WALTER Oh --! You mean that painting! Uhh, sorry! It's like a jumble of ideas, rattling around in my brain! Beat. 
NOSY GUY So where do you get your ideas? 
WALTER What do you mean? 
NOSY GUY I mean -- (confused at this confusion) Why are they... images of children? Yikes. Walter starts to sweat. He didn't think this through. 
WALTER Well, er, I've just always loved kids. Though mostly I was influenced by my darling daughter... An odd beat. 
WALTER I remember when she was a baby... Walter gets a far-off look. 
WALTER Yeah. Cute little thing. I'd stare into those big orbs. Sometimes I'd get out my Brownie and snap a photo... but... that's not subjective. You know? It doesn't capture your feelings. So that's when I started painting her... We hold on Walter, unsure where reality begins and ends... 
CUT TO: 
INT. BERKELEY APARTMENT - DAY 
CU on a fuzzy TV SCREEN: A PRIGGISH MAN is griping. The screen is captioned "JOHN CANADAY, NY TIMES ART CRITIC" 
CANADAY (ON TV) Keane's work is completely without distinction. He is not a member of the Society of Western Artists. He has won no awards. He's only noteworthy for his appearances in a certain newspaper's gossip column! 
(EXASPERATED) Mr. Keane is why society NEEDS critics! To protect them from such atrocities! Walter gapes at the TV, outraged. He suddenly grabs a PHONE. 
IN THE LIVING ROOM Jane is BANGING on a closed door. 
JANE Mom! I wanna come in. 
MARGARET (O.S.) Uhh, you can't. Mommy's busy. 
JANE (she BANGS again) Let me in! What are you doing in there? Why's the door always locked? 
Walter enters -- and reacts. He glides over to the girl. 
WALTER Janie, sweetie, you need to respect your mother's privacy. Sometimes grownups need alone time. 
(HE WINKS) Is that the ice cream truck? Why don't you go get yourself a fudgesicle? Walter tosses her a dime. She peers warily, then leaves. He waits a beat -- then pulls out a KEY. Walter discreetly unlocks the painting room. 
INT. APARTMENT PAINTING ROOM - SAME TIME 
WALTER (CONT'D) I traveled the Continent. The ravages were horrifying... 
CUT TO: 
INSERT - FULL FRAME TV SCREEN Walter is on TV, on a LOCAL PUBLIC AFFAIRS SHOW. He's coated with makeup, sitting rigidly, fingers gripping his chair. 
WALTER (ON TV) My psyche was scarred in my art student days. Nothing in my life has ever made such an impact as the sight of the children: War-wracked innocents, without homes, without parents, fighting over garbage... He sits in a half-circle of PROPER WOMEN, who are spellbound. 
WALTER (ON TV) Goaded by a frantic despair, I sketched these dirty, ragged little victims... with their bruised minds and bodies, their matted hair and runny noses. There my life as a painter began in earnest. Walter sadly looks up to the HOST. The man is shellshocked. Mute. Walter waits, then sighs. 
WALTER (ON TV) The insane, inhuman cruelty inflicted upon these children cut deeply into my being. From that moment on, I painted the lost children with the eyes. Those eyes that forever retained their haunting quality. The ladies are stricken. A few dab their eyes. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - DAY 
Keane posters get RIPPED off a wall. RIPPED off a mailbox. PULLED off a construction site! 
EXT. KEANE GALLERY - NEXT DAY 
Walter strides along, a bounce to his step. He reaches the gallery -- then stops, dumbfounded. It's PACKED with PEOPLE! Not rich, but regular folks, gawking at the art. 
Wow. A sweet moment... then some TOURISTS see Walter and happily accost him: "Walter Keane!" "Mr. Keane!" They thrust papers and POSTERS at him to autograph. Walter grins and scribbles his signature. Glancing over their shoulders, he sees Ruben down the block, standing outside his own gallery. Gaping in disbelief. Walter chuckles... then flips him off. Ruben's face falls. 
INT. KEANE GALLERY - SAME TIME 
Walter pushes through, shaking hands, greeting the CUSTOMERS: 
WALTER Good afternoon! Delighted! (he reaches the SEXY BLONDE CLERK and pinches her ass) How many sales today? 
BLONDE CLERK "Sales?" None with this crowd. Walter's smile drops, surprised. 
BLONDE CLERK These people are looky-loos! They can't afford the paintings. But we gave away a heap of posters! Huh? Walter peers, baffled. Suddenly -- a loud FRWWIPPPP! Walter whirls, startled. Outside, two GIRLS tear a big poster off the front window. Walter's eyes widen. Slowly, he turns back. At the counter, FOLKS and KIDS are grabbing free posters from a box. Walter stares. Processing this. And then... being struck by an idea of absolute genius... 
INT. STORAGE ROOM - SECONDS LATER 
Walter is on the telephone, peering through the doorway. Hiding from the customers. Spying. WHISPERING. 
WALTER (ON THE PHONE) It's the craziest thing. I started charging for the posters! First a nickel... then a dime. (struggling to whisper) YES, Maggie! It's cuckoo! So it got me thinkin': Would you rather sell a $500 painting, or a million cheaply- reproduced posters?! (he LAUGHS, exultant) 
(MORE) 
WALTER (ON THE PHONE) (CONT'D) See, folks don't care if it's a copy. They just want art that touches them! 
CUT TO: 
ANIMATION 
WALTER'S VOICE And then... we could sell it anywhere!! EVERYWHERE! 60's-style MADISON AVENUE GRAPHICS: A still of a HARDWARE STORE. Mops, light bulbs, then -- BING! -- framed KEANES. A PHARMACY. Aspirin, candy bars -- BING! -- framed KEANES. A GAS STATION. Tires, motor oil, and -- BING! -- KEANES. 
INT. SUPERMARKET - DAY 
An aisle of Sundries: Plastic toys, beach balls... Waifs. A sign says "WE HAVE KEANE!" Around the corner, Margaret shuffles along, listlessly buying banalities: Cereal. Soap. She turns the cart... and runs into her wall of teary-eyed kids. Margaret peers, muddled. Then she turns away -- to a RACK OF PAPERBACKS. They offer fast hope, inspiration. Margaret seems disconnected. She runs her hand down the options... a book of Numerology... a book on Judaism... an Edgar Cayce prophecies manual... AT THE REGISTER - Margaret gazes up. The CASHIER is a sad Beatnik Girl. In a haze, Margaret notices the whole market is full of LONELY WOMEN: One LADY is her doppelganger -- same age, blonde, gripping a cart. Next aisle over, a MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN stares into space. Nearby, a YOUNG MOM wrangles her children. We shift to Margaret. Face gaunt. Eyes empty. Troubled... 
INT. APARTMENT PAINTING ROOM - DAY 
Curtains drawn, Margaret frantically SKETCHES. She's cabin feverish. In her robe. Hair dirty. And -- up to something. These sketches aren't squat children with round eyes. They're different: Figures with long lines. Margaret frowns and rips the paper. She tries again! Another angular figure -- straight fingers... no! Again! A woman... reclining. Then an indication of a face: A slash... and then -- two small almond shapes for eyes. 
Hmm. Margaret's face brightens. She likes it. 
LATER Margaret rabidly paints. Spurting globs of color. The woman is blonde, almond eyes cool, lips curled with mystery... Margaret glances in a mirror. It's a self-portrait. It's Margaret, aloof. Alone at a table. Suddenly the door opens. Margaret GASPS, startled, and spins the canvas away. Walter barges in, dressed like a million. He HALTS -- making a sour face. 
WALTER Whew! Something smells in here. You should open a window. Margaret blinks, a bit dazed. 
MARGARET What time is it? 
WALTER I dunno. 6:30, 7? ...Didn't Janie get dinner? Margaret shrugs. Walter leans in. 
WALTER When's the last time you washed your hair? 
WALTER Yeah, we don't talk about it. Sadly, people don't buy lady art. 
MARGARET 
(INTERJECTING) What about Georgia O'Keefe? Dick shakes his EMPTY GLASS, distracted. Walter points. 
WALTER The bar's over there. Dick goes to get a refill. Walter shoots Margaret a look. 
WALTER Yeah, Margaret's a superb artist, in her own way. I even steal a few tips from her, now and then! 
(HE CHUCKLES) Behind every great man is a great woman. 
DICK True true. So Margaret, where do you get your ideas? 
MARGARET (a bit tentative) Oh... from the world around me. And I love Modigliani's use of line. 
DICK ModiWHAT? The Italian joint? 
WALTER Oh, for Christ's sake, Margaret! Dick writes a gossip column -- 
(BEAT) Let's stick to the family angle. Get a gander at little Janie over there! Walter steers Dick to Jane, cute at her little child's easel. 
WALTER What a talent! Look at these Keanes! If you cut open our veins, we bleed oil! Er -- turpentine. 
(AWKWARD) Uh, Dick, you know what I'm goin' for. Make it sound good. DING-DONG! It's the doorbell. Everyone turns. 
JANE Who's that? 
WALTER Ah! A little treat! The fourth member of the Painting Keanes! Margaret and Jane turn, confused. Walter whips open 
THE FRONT DOOR Revealing LILY, 10, a quiet girl in bobbed hair. She holds a little overnight bag. A Buick HONKS, and Walter waves as it drives away. Walter stares at the girl, then puts on big hammy airs. 
WALTER Lily, honey, how are you?! He gives her a giant hug. She responds stiffly -- a girl who doesn't see her father too often. 
LILY I'm fine, Dad. I lost a tooth. 
WALTER Really? Did you get in a fight? 
LILY 
(SHE LAUGHS) No. It fell out! 
ANGLE - MARGARET AND JANE They gape in bewilderment. Who the hell is this girl??! 
BACK ON WALTER AND LILY Walter admires Lily's mouth. 
WALTER Well is the tooth fairy somethin' I gotta deal with, or did your mother already handle it? 
LILY 
(DRY) She handled it. 
WALTER Good! Good good! Well, just go throw your stuff in the kids' room, then you can come join the fun! Lily toddles out. 
ON THE GROUP Margaret and Jane are speechless. Walter acts like nothing bizarre has happened. Dick eyeballs all this with major curiosity. 
DICK Walter... you never told me you had another daughter. 
WALTER Didn't I? Sure. Lil's from my first marriage. Margaret struggles to hold her rage. Disoriented... 
MARGARET Walter? 
(URGENT) Walter! We need to speak. Margaret gestures: Get in the kitchen! He nods and follows. 
INT. KITCHEN 
Margaret shuts the door, then spins on him. 
MARGARET What is going on here??! 
(PLEASED) So what's your mom like? 
LILY She's pretty. She drives a Buick. She cries a lot. 
JANE Yeah, mine's the same. 
(BEAT) Except she drives a Packard. Lily nods. Jane lowers her voice naughtily. 
JANE I have some peanut butter hidden in my sock drawer. Do you wanna eat it? Lily smiles: Sure. Jane opens a drawer and removes a jar of Skippy. The two girls sit on the floor, happily eating the peanut butter with their fingers. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. KEANE GALLERY - NIGHT 
Klieg lights streak the sky! A crazed CROWD is packed INSIDE. A big sign announces: "NOW APPEARING: AMERICA'S FIRST FAMILY OF ART - 'We paint truth and emotion.'" 
INT. KEANE GALLERY - NIGHT 
The place is filled with Big Eyes. Waifs waifs waifs! Cash registers RING. Money changes hands. "Sold" stickers go up. Walter works the room. 
WALTER Yeah, Walter Keane and Gauguin have a lot in common. They both walked away from successful careers to travel the globe, live on a boat... We move... finding Margaret alone in a small ANNEX. It displays a few of her sad blondes, alongside Jane and Lily's paintings of flowers and Mr. Potato-Head. Margaret sits, seeming like an adult at the children's table. An urbane RICH MAN glides by... and is taken with one of Margaret's nubile blondes. He gazes at the lounging figure. Margaret sits up. Alert, pleased with his interest. She tingles. Then, happily excited, unable to hold it in: 
MARGARET I painted it! 
RICH MAN Really? 
(IMPRESSED) It's very evocative. ...Sensual... He smiles flirtatiously. She smiles shyly and shrugs. 
He steps forward -- then peers closer at the painting. The SIGNATURE is a feminine scroll: "MDH Keane" 
RICH MAN "MDH"? You're so... mysterioso. 
MARGARET Yes, we don't use my name, since people don't take women's art seriously. 
(BEAT) "MDH" are my initials. And more! I'm interested in numerology... and as you know, seven is a very good number. 
RICH MAN 
(PUZZLED) Er... seven? 
MARGARET Luckily, my maiden name is Margaret Doris Hawkins! "M" is the 13th letter of the alphabet, "D" is 4, "H" 8! If you add up 1 and 3 in 13, that gives you 4, making 4 plus 4 plus 8 equals 16, then 1 plus 6 equals seven! The man's head is spinning. He's lost all interest. Across the room, Walter sees this debacle. He marches over. 
WALTER Psst! Maggie! Can I have a second? (he PULLS HER ASIDE) Good grief! What the hell are you babbling about?! Long division?? Could you please help the world and shut your mouth? You want just one number in his head: The sales price! Her face drops, hurt. Acquiescing. 
WATCHING THIS Two SNOBBY ARTISTS smirk and GROAN at this scene. 
SNOBBY ARTIST #1 Two nuts that fell from the same tree! It's insufferable. Why are we starving, while they print money? 
SNOBBY ARTIST #2 Because that nut's a genius! He sells paintings! Then he sells pictures of the paintings! Then he sells postcards of pictures of the paintings. 
They stare bitterly. Then, a terrible, shameful idea forms: 
SNOBBY ARTIST #1 I'll bet I could bang one out in ten minutes. 
SNOBBY ARTIST #2 It wouldn't have the dopey sincerity. 
SNOBBY ARTIST #1 The customers won't notice... They peer sheepishly at each other...

EXT. STORE WINDOW - DAY 
Ruben is walking past -- then stops, pained. A window display of Keane Big Eyes shares space with paintings of CUTESY KITTENS lapping up milk. We WIDEN, revealing a whole wall of rip-offs! All with odd anonymous signatures: "Gig." "Eve." "Igor." A cavalcade of 
WIDE-EYED ANIMALS AND KIDS... DANCING WITH GUITARS... DRESSED AS HOBOS... PLAYING IN PAJAMAS. But these children aren't sad. They're just... blank. Ruben gasps at the dead-eyed pictures. 
RUBEN Christ. It's a movement. 
CUT TO: 
INT. PAINTING ROOM 
A room full of MDHs and Keanes. Dee-Ann stops, puzzled. She glances at Margaret -- who has turned white as a ghost. Immensely curious, Dee-Ann slowly enters. She peers around at the two styles of paintings... A strained silence. Finally, Margaret whispers. 
MARGARET W-Walter paints in here too. Hmm. Dee-Ann walks about, examining the canvases. Then, her gaze settles on the Big Eye that Margaret was working on. Below the easel is the wet brush on the open jar of paint. Margaret sucks in her breath. Dee-Ann sees this. 
DEE-ANN Is Walter home?? Margaret has no answer. The two friends look at each other... Dee-Ann waiting... wondering if Margaret is going to lie to her... 
When..... SLAM! 
WIDE Both women startle. FOOTSTEPS. Then... Walter strides in! Margaret's eyes pop. Walter's pop even bigger. He glares at the ladies. 
WALTER What the hell's going on here?!! 
MARGARET 
(TIMID) Uh... Dee-Ann was just... she... Margaret trails off. Walter thinks, then SNAPS. 
WALTER You KNOW I don't like anyone seeing my work before it's done! Walter rushes to the Waif, then for show grabs up the wet brush and quickly starts to "finish" the painting. Suddenly -- an odd expression crosses his face. He eyeballs the canvas, realizing he doesn't know what to do. A furtive glance. Then, unbowed, he hastily dips the brush and slaps a little black onto the shaded background. Walter spins, victorious. 
WALTER There! 
CUT TO: 
INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER 
The three sit silently, tension thick, sipping gin fizzes. Nobody speaks. Walter finishes his drink and pours a fresh one. 
CUT TO: 
INT. FOYER - NIGHT 
They are drunk and SCREAMING. Walter pushes Dee-Ann out the door. 
WALTER You and your whole non-representational crowd are FRAUDS!! 
DEE-ANN SHUT UP! You're so full of shit, Walter! 
WALTER Get outta my house! My big house! 
(LIVID) Go back to sellin' your coat hanger sculptures on Fisherman's Wharf! 
DEE-ANN Fuck you! Dee-Ann staggers outside, then hops in her car. 
OUTSIDE Dee-Ann GUNS the engine and squeals away. The car peels down the very long driveway. Margaret and Walter watch the car disappear into the distance. Without looking over, Walter speaks. 
WALTER I don't want her ever invited here again. Margaret nods, terribly sad. 
MARGARET I won't. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MASTER BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT 
Margaret and Walter lie in bed, awake. Arms crossed. Unspeaking. 
EXT. WOODSIDE HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY 
Margaret and 13-YEAR-OLD JANE play on the lawn with the poodle. Jane laughs as the dog chases in circles. 
JANE Go, Rembrandt! Get the ball! She tumbles, and Rembrandt licks her ear. She giggles. 
MARGARET Okay, honey. I have to go work. 
JANE Can I come? (an awkward silence) No. I can never come. No! I shouldn't even ask. Jane glares glumly. Margaret peers hopelessly at her daughter... then goes inside. 
INT. WOODSIDE HOUSE 
Margaret strolls to her studio. WE SEE the poodle scampering behind her on its cute little legs. She enters the 
WALTER "Cenic"...? Uh, what's that? Margaret stares, eyes sharp. 
MARGARET Cenic is the name of the artist who did all your early paintings. 
WALTER Huhhh? (spinning his lie) Urgh... oh! CENIC! (he laughs crazily) Cenic was my nickname in Paris! All my art school pals loved my scenic views, so they called me "Scenic"! But since those Frogs can't pronounce a hard "e," I became "Cenic." He looks up at her hopefully. But she shakes her head. 
MARGARET The more you lie, the smaller you seem. 
WALTER (unyielding, scrambling) How DARE you accuse me of lying! I'm proud of my early Cenics! 
MARGARET Then why do you paint over the name? Walter gasps, floored. Margaret bores in. 
MARGARET A bit of advice: Don't use a water- base over an oil. It flecks off. Walter cowers. 
WALTER You sound crazy! For God's sake. You've... you've SEEN me paint!!!! 
MARGARET No, I haven't. 
(QUIET; STRONG) I always thought I had... but it's some kind of... mirage. From a distance you look like a painter, but up close... there's nothing there. 
CLOSEUP - WALTER All life drains from his face. His eyes go glazed. He speaks mechanically. Tiredly... 
WALTER I studied art in Paris. I went to school at the Beaux-Arts. The Grand Chaumiere. I spent hours in the Louvre, gazing at the greatness of the Masters... 
MARGARET Walter? He turns. She winces, pained. 
MARGARET Have you even been to Paris? Walter blanches. He shakes, broken up. He looks away, then staggers to a chair. He falls into it. Trembling. Not able to look her in the eye... 
WALTER I wanted... I so wanted to be an artist. But -- it just never turned out good. Margaret stares, seething. Then, without comment, she storms away. She SLAMS the door shut. BANG! Walter doesn't move. 
CUT TO: 
INT. KITCHEN - NEXT MORNING 
Margaret makes Jane breakfast, scrambling up eggs. Jane glances over her shoulder -- and notices Walter in the living room, asleep on the couch. An awkward pause. Jane says nothing. 
INT. MASTER BEDROOM - LATER 
Margaret is making the bed. Straightening the pillows. In the b.g., Walter silently creeps into view. Shamefully standing in the doorway. Not speaking... Margaret knows he's there, but doesn't acknowledge his presence. Finally, without making eye contact -- 
MARGARET I don't want you sleeping in this room any longer. I -- I can't keep living these lies. 
(SHARP) There's three extra bedrooms. Go pick one. He nods. 
INT. HOUSE - LATER 
Margaret sits, unmoving, trapped in the big house. Outside, a JAPANESE GARDENER trims the hedges. Margaret stares at the walls, a smothering Walter Hall of Fame: Framed magazine articles on Walter, smugly posed with the Waifs. She swallows, then gently opens a dresser drawer. Inside is an ORIGINAL WAIF from long ago. A small oil of Jane, when she was a toddler. Margaret stares... and then her face slowly crumbles. 
INT. PAINTING ROOM - DAY 
Margaret huddles with a SKETCHPAD. Rembrandt is at her feet. She's drawing. She looks up, as Walter anxiously enters. He's holding a drink. He clears his throat. 
WALTER What are you working on? 
MARGARET A new MDH. Something for me. It's about a woman trapped in an uncaring world. I call it, "Escape." Walter bites his lip, afraid to talk. 
WALTER I figured out a solution to our problems. 
MARGARET What? 
WALTER Teach me. 
(BEAT) Show me your tricks. Then you can pass off the Waifs, and we won't be lying anymore. She looks up in disbelief. 
MARGARET And then -- YOU'LL paint them? 
WALTER Sure! Why not? 
MARGARET 
REDHEAD CLERK Uh, let me -- 
WALTER What about the OILS?! Are there more at the warehouse? 
REDHEAD CLERK Mr. Keane, I'd have to make a -- 
WALTER For the LOVE OF MUD! What am I PAYING you for? The girl freezes, rattled. Walter spins, flipping out. 
WALTER Hypothetical question: If you were a man, would you marry Kim Novak or my wife? What? 
WALTER Okay! Different question! If I got crippled and had to stop painting, how long before the gallery ran out of inventory and went belly up?? 
REDHEAD CLERK 
(RATTLED) Do you want a glass of water, Mr. Keane? Walter sighs. His thoughts drift away... 
WALTER What's it all mean? Why are we put on this earth? A 100 years from now, will people even know we existed...? 
REDHEAD CLERK 
(UNCOMFORTABLE) I -- I don't understand. You'll always be famous. You were on the Jack Paar Show... (she glances away) Er, excuse me, sir. The girl hurries away, to ring up some customers. Walter silently watches. At the register, the Tourists buy a print. A "Madonna and Child," MDH-style. BAMMM! Walter's eyes bulge, like he's been stung. 
WALTER It's not even mine! It's one of hers. Aching, he staggers off. Sweating, woozy, he sits at a table. Distracted, he glances down at a newspaper... 
INSERT - NEWSPAPER There's an article on the 1964 NEW YORK WORLD'S FAIR. A headline says "CONSTRUCTION RACES TOWARD APRIL OPENING" 
TIGHT - WALTER His eyes narrow, piqued. World's Fair??? He leans in...

INT. BISTRO - NIGHT 
A return to the charming bistro Margaret and Walter went to all those years ago, on their first date. The Maitre'd BEAMS. 
MAITRE'D Ah! Monsieur and Madame Keane! Delighted! Always such an honor! ANGLE on the Keanes. They are sullen. At wit's end. 
AT THE TABLE - LATER They stiffly sit at their old table. He snarls, eyes black. 
WALTER This doesn't change anything. 
MARGARET (trying to hold her ground) I know the truth. 
WALTER Who cares?! This is all your fault! Maybe it's time to shake things up. Start puttin' my name on the MDH's. Margaret is astonished. A fury crosses her face. 
MARGARET NO! Absolutely NOT!! I still hate myself for giving you the Waifs! 
WALTER Quiet! Lower your voice -- 
MARGARET Oh, I'll talk as LOUD AS I WANT -- 
WALTER NO YOU WON'T! Or -- 
(FLAILING) I'll have you whacked! She jerks, flabbergasted. 
MARGARET What??! 
WALTER If you tell ANYONE, if you squeal, I'll take you out! I -- I know people. Remember Banducci's cousin? The liquor wholesaler? Pause. Margaret breaks into tears. 
MARGARET You're threatening me...?! Fine, kill me! My God, I've kept our secret for years! I've never once -- 
(CRYING) Do you know what it's been like for me? I don't have any friends. I've lied to my own child... Margaret shudders, distraught. Mascara runs down her cheeks. Walter squirms, uneasy with this. 
WALTER Christ, wipe your face! You look a mess. 
(BEAT) It's life imitating art! A crying Keane! He hands her his handkerchief. She dabs at her eyes. A looming quiet. 
MARGARET What do you want, Walter? Everything with you is calculated. We're back where we had our first date... Walter's eyes widen. We MOVE IN TIGHT on them. He drops his voice. Dead serious. 
WALTER Look, I don't deny I need you. You're the one with the gift. 
INSERT - LIFE MAGAZINE A gargantuan spread. The LIFE ARTICLE is titled "The Man Who Paints Those Big Eyes." We PULL OUT... 
INT. NEW YORK TIMES - DAY 
Starchy John Canaday reads the article, gaping in utter disbelief. His desk says "JOHN CANADAY, SENIOR ART CRITIC." He also has Walter's BOOK, "Tomorrow's Masters Series." We WIDEN, revealing he's in the busy New York Times NEWSROOM. 
CANADAY Four... five... SIX pages! Is there something here I'm missing? 
(UPSET) He's like -- the Hula-Hoop! He just won't go away...! He flips a page -- then his jaw drops. 
CANADAY "Will be unveiled in the Grand Pavilion of the Hall of Education... internationally celebrated artist has been selected... will represent the aspirations of children worldwide --" 
(HE GASPS) Oh this is ABSURD! He GRABS for his phone. 
INT. WORLD'S FAIR HALL OF EDUCATION - DAY 
A panel flicks, and the huge empty space lights up. It's overwhelmingly cavernous, a bright, freshly-painted Space Age spectacular. Up high hangs The Masterpiece and its 100 kids. A sign says "TOMORROW FOREVER." Below, two tiny figures walk in: Canaday and an obtuse CIVIC LEADER. Canaday stares up in horror. Utterly stupefied. 
CANADAY And WHO was on the selection committee? 
CIVIC LEADER Oh! Well there wasn't a "committee," per se. We just had a luncheon with me, Ed, Jerome, Jerome's wife... 
(MORE) 
CIVIC LEADER (CONT'D) 
(HE THINKS) Though technically, we didn't invite submissions. Mr. Keane just contacted us directly! Canaday reacts, smoldering. 
INT. NEW YORK MANSION - DAY 
A STRING QUARTET PLAYS at a GRAND PARTY. It's completely fabulous -- an old-money mansion filled with stuffy BLUE BLOODS, all tuxes and gowns. In the doorway appear Walter and Margaret. They're dressed to kill. Walter's radiant -- but Margaret looks like she's about to emotionally disintegrate. Suddenly, he WHISPERS. 
WALTER Stop. Let us appreciate this moment. This is what we've worked toward our whole lives: Rarified air. Inside this house are the movers and shakers. Kennedys. Rockefellers. 
(MISTY-EYED) Until today, we've always been on the outside, looking in. But when we enter... we will belong. 
MARGARET I was happier selling paintings in the park. He gapes, appalled. 
WALTER You are one crazy bitch. Walter spins and grandly enters. He grabs two CHAMPAGNES from a server. 
WALTER So maybe you have problems with the choices we made... but -- c'mon! Wednesday, the World's Fair opens. Thursday, our book goes on sale! 
MARGARET Friday, I file for divorce. 
WALTER Aw, why are you always so miserable? 
(IRRITATED) Well, I'm gonna enjoy my afternoon! The HOSTESS is a bejeweled dowager. Walter makes a beeline. 
WALTER Mrs. Teasdale! Walter Keane. I just want to thank you for hosting this absolutely enchanting soiree. Walter takes the woman's hand. She smiles stiffly, silently horrified. She glances around for help. She catches a SOCIETY MAN's eye, and he hurries over. 
SOCIETY MAN Hey, Keane. Have you seen the Times? 
WALTER Er, no. Honestly, I've been so busy all day preparing for this lovely -- 
SOCIETY MAN I think you should read the Times. The Man gestures. Perplexed, the Keanes follow him into a 
INT. DEN - SAME TIME 
The room looks like a hunting lodge. On the desk are all the DAILY PAPERS. Walter grabs the NEW YORK TIMES -- then gasps. 
INSERT - NEW YORK TIMES It's open to a reproduction of "Tomorrow Forever," above a scathing REVIEW. 
THE KEANES stare, then turn pale. 
INSERT - REVIEW A BLIZZARD of WORDS assaults us: 
"GROTESQUE" "APPALLING" 
"TASTELESS" "Lowest common denominator" 
STOP IT! He lights ANOTHER MATCH. 
WALTER You like making me look bad?? You enjoy people laughing at me??! He PUNCHES the wall, then tosses the match. Fwoosh! 
MARGARET Walter! He throws ANOTHER MATCH. 
WIDE Margaret grabs Jane and starts running. They rush into the blackness. Walter squints woozily, then starts to CHASE -- 
INT. HALLWAY 
The ladies run for their lives. Violent THUDS behind them! Something SMASHES. Margaret reaches the Painting Room. She YANKS Jane inside, then SLAMS the door! Walter staggers up. 
WALTER 
LET ME IN! 
INSIDE THE PAINTING ROOM Margaret LOCKS the door. She backs away. 
INT. HALLWAY 
Walter tugs the door. He POUNDS it, crazed. 
WALTER Lemme in, you BITCHES!! 
INSIDE THE PAINTING ROOM Margaret and Jane shudder. All around them, Big Eyes stare down from above. 
INT. HALLWAY 
In his haze, Walter remembers the hidden key. Raging, he drunkenly pulls over the chair, then stands on it. But he's too wobbly -- and falls. Bam! 
WALTER Ow! 
INSIDE THE PAINTING ROOM Margaret hugs Jane. 
JANE Mom, what are we gonna do??! Margaret thinks. 
INT. HALLWAY 
Walter laughs crazily and lights another MATCH. It flickers. 
WALTER You got all that paint and turpentine in there? Well I'm gonna burn you up! He pushes the lit match through the KEYHOLE. 
WALTER You're gonna blow like an atom bomb! 
INSIDE THE PAINTING ROOM The match drops on the floor -- then goes out, harmless. That's it. Margaret makes a decision. 
MARGARET We're leaving. Determined, Margaret runs to the curtained wall. She whips it aside -- revealing the sliding glass doors. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - MINUTES LATER 
Walter is lighting another match -- when he spins. Through rheumy eyes, HEADLIGHTS orbit across the front window. He peers, confused...

INT. CAR - DRIVING - NIGHT 
Margaret and Jane drive fast. Adrenaline pumping. Lights of the city flash across their faces. 
MARGARET I'm sorry I wasn't the mother I could have been. I -- I should have done this years ago... 
JANE But where are we going? 
(FLUMMOXED) We don't even have any clothes! 
MARGARET Where we're going, we won't need much.

Dick Nolan reads the article -- and SPITS UP his martini.

RUBEN Who would WANT credit?! 
INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY 
Walter sits in his favorite haunt, eating lunch and reading a NEWSPAPER. Suddenly -- he GASPS. 
WALTER Holy mother of GOD! Walter JERKS UP -- feral -- like an animal sensing danger. He whirls and looks around. Paranoia ratcheting. Is everybody staring at him? Walter starts shaking in horror. Then -- he jumps and BOLTS OUT. 
INT. BAR - NIGHT 
Walter sits with Dick. Walter's desperate, sweaty. 
WALTER Margaret's gone berserk! You gotta help me! I need a story, a wire story -- national! -- to calm things down. Dick peers shrewdly. 
DICK I don't know... Walter. What she has said is pretty inflammatory. 
WALTER But it's nuts! It doesn't even make sense. When I was studying art at the Beaux Arts in Paris, she was still a kid in Tennessee! Dick reacts. Walter whips out the "Tomorrow's Master's" BOOK. 
WALTER Look! These are my early sketches. (he flips pages, like a 
MAGICIAN) See?! Berlin orphans, 1946! 
DICK 
(PIQUED) But... how could she... 
WALTER Exactly! It's impossible! We didn't meet for another nine years! After she busted her first marriage. 
(HE SHRUGS) Hell, she busted OUR marriage! Sleeping around with whatever trash she could find!! Dick's head is spinning. 
DICK I-I, but... why would Maggie do this? 
WALTER She's unhinged! She left me and moved into the jungle. She fell in with a bunch of religious zealots: 
(WHISPERING) Jehovah's Witnesses. 
DICK I really don't know much about them... 
WALTER Oh! These people are gone! Solid gone! They don't celebrate Christmas, they can't salute the flag... they won't even let Janie go to the prom! Dick is startled.

GANNETT LAWYER We were charged with libel. You're charged with slander. 
(BLASE) Just dance your way out of it. The Lawyers file out, leaving Walter alone at the table. He looks very small and pale. The Judge peers quizzically. 
JUDGE Mr. Keane, you appear to be without counsel. Would you like a postponement, in order to get your affairs in order? Walter glances over at Margaret. She stifles a laugh. He glares daggers. Then, cocksure, foolhardy, he jumps to his feet. 
WALTER I've always taken care of myself, Your Honor. And I don't need a bunch of rent-a-suits to defend my good name!

DICK (V.O.) I'm concerned about my old pal Walter Keane. The Hawaiian heat may have cooked his brain! The only thing he knows about courtrooms and lawyers comes from watching Perry Mason on television! 
CUT TO: 
INT. COURTROOM - LATER 
Walter stands down front. Like a Broadway star, center-stage. 
WALTER I'm the sole creator of my art. This is my total life. My contribution to the world -- 
JUDGE Mr. KEANE! I've told you, you must ask the witness questions! If you're acting as your own attorney, you cannot make statements at this time. 
WALTER Oh. Right! Ah, sorry, Your Honor. 
(BEAT) It's hard to keep this all straight... Walter gathers his thoughts -- then turns to the WITNESS STAND. Sitting in it... is Margaret. 
WALTER Mrs. Keane. It seems impossible that you'd expect anybody to swallow your fantastic story -- 
JUDGE 
MR. KEANE!! Walter grimaces. He tries again, choosing his words. 
WALTER Mrs. Keane. You seem like a lucid woman. Reasonably intelligent... So how could you possibly have gone along with such a far-out scheme? 
We slowly MOVE IN ON MARGARET. This is her moment. And then -- quietly, she speaks. 
MARGARET I was forced into it. You had -- She stops, bothered by this awkwardness. She looks away from Walter, to the Jury instead. 
MARGARET He had me dominated. He would rant and rave if I didn't do what he wanted. I was afraid. I didn't see any option, so I went along. I felt very bad... 
WALTER (like a TV lawyer) I want to remind you you are under oath. The Judge SLAMS his fists down, enraged. Walter jumps. 
WALTER S-sorry. Margaret turns back to the Jury. 
MARGARET I just gave in. I allowed him to take credit for the big eyes. They reflected all my feelings... and... it was like losing a child... 
(SHE SIGHS) I was weak. I didn't feel I could leave and support myself and my daughter. He said nobody would buy the paintings without his personality. 
(SOFT) Maybe he was right... 
(TO WALTER) You were very talented at being charming. You were a genius at salesmanship and promotion. 
WALTER Hm! It sounds like you've described two different men. One a sadistic ogre... and the other a delightful bon vivant. Margaret stares him in the eyes. 
MARGARET That's you, Walter. Jekyll and Hyde. 
LATER 
WALTER Miss Natalie Wood walked up and said, "That is the greatest single painting I have ever seen in my entire life." The Judge is bored out of his mind. 
LATER 
WALTER I was born in a small town. My father made upholstery for the automobile 
INDUSTRY -- 
JUDGE You're done. Walter stops, surprised. 
WALTER B-but, I'm not finished -- 
JUDGE Actually, you are! (he blows his stack) I cannot stomach one more wild tangent or shaggy dog tale. You're not testifying -- you're filibustering! The Federal Courts are overburdened enough, without your docket-clogging nonsense. 
(BEAT) We can stay here until we grow old and die... but it's obvious that this case boils down to your word versus Mrs. Keane's word. 
WALTER 
(HOPEFUL) So... mistrial? 
JUDGE NO! It's not a mistrial!! In my opinion, there's only one way to clear up this thicket. You are both going to paint. Walter gasps, stunned. All color drains from his face. 
ANGLE - MARGARET Her face lights up. She slowly breaks into a satisfied smile. 
CUT TO: 
INT. COURTROOM - LATER 
The doors SLAM open. The Bailiff leads in a crew of COURT DEPUTIES, all carrying ART SUPPLIES: Easels, brushes, paint... 
BAILIFF Awright, bring those easels down. Careful, don't bump anything... watch it with those paint cans, I got some newspaper on the floor down front... The Jury is fascinated. Margaret watches, quite eager. In the gallery, Jane grins. But Walter is horrified. Trying not to tremble. 
DOWN FRONT The Bailiff directs the deputies, setting up TWO EASELS, back to back. On each easel is placed a small square canvas. The Judge addresses the room. 
JUDGE Now, I'm not looking for a masterpiece. I don't know much about these things -- I'm a jurist, not an art critic -- but, is one hour enough? Margaret nods: Sure. Shaking, Walter barely moves his head. 
JUDGE Okay then. You've both been provided with identical supplies... so -- without any further business... Mrs. Keane, Mr. Keane, the court is yours. 
WIDE Margaret glances at Walter. What will he do? Walter's face is grimly blank. Margaret proceeds. Slowly, she pushes her chair from the table and rises. Walter doesn't move. Margaret walks over to the closest EASEL, then sits. She ties on a smock over her checkered dress. 
THE JURORS crane their necks, intently curious. 
MARGARET takes a pencil. She peeks over at Walter -- who's still glued to his seat. His face tight, his expression queasy. Staring off to some faraway place. Margaret looks up at the CLOCK. 3:20. Okay then. Totally calm, in a motion she's done so many times, she focuses on the canvas and starts outlining a Waif. Everybody watches. Effortlessly, she pencils the EYES. They are enormous. The largest orbs she has ever done. 
WALTER looks ill. Wracked with uncertainty. The Judge turns to him. 
JUDGE Mr. Keane? 
WALTER 
(FAINT) I'm... setting the mood. 
(WHISPERING) Getting the... muse to strike... 
JUDGE 
(BEAT) Well, your muse has 58 minutes. 
MARGARET fills in more detail. Ears... nose... then, little fingers clutching a fence. The child is peeking over it, staring right at us... 
WALTER is melting down. In total crisis... 
THE CLOCK'S second hand sweeps around. It's 3:34... 
THE JURORS look from Margaret to Walter. Why isn't he moving?? 
MARGARET finishes penciling. She leans back, satisfied with the composition. Then, she reaches for... the PAINT. She unscrews a tube and squirts it on the palette. She rests it on her lap and starts mixing a flesh tone...

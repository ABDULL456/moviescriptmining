CONTINUED: 
Jane puts her plate in the dishwasher and leaves. We FOLLOW HER out the door, then the camera JERKS back to Lester calling after her. 
CLOSE on the face of   RICKY FITTS, illuminated by the screen of his DIGICAM as he   videotapes. Ricky is eighteen, but his eyes are much older.   Beneath his Zen-like tranquility lurks something wounded...   and dangerous. 
His POV, on VIDEO: Through the kitchen window, we see Lester at the sink, rinsing off his plate, muttering to himself. His head suddenly jerks up and he looks at us, as if he realizes he's being watched. 
INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 
Lester's POV: We're looking out through the kitchen window at the point where Ricky was just standing, but he's no longer there. 
Lester turns off the faucet, dries his hands, then tosses the towel on the counter on his way out, where it lands next to a framed PHOTOGRAPH of Lester, Carolyn, and a much-younger Jane, taken several years earlier at an amusement park. 
It's startling how happy they look. 
EXT. SALE HOUSE - DAY 
CLOSE on a wooden SIGN that reads: 
OPEN HOUSE TODAY 
BURNHAM & ASSOCIATES REALTY 
555-0195 Carolyn Burnham 
The sign is planted in front of a RUN-DOWN HOME in a   run-down neighborhood. The Mercedes is parked in front of the   house. Carolyn, wearing a smart business suit, is unloading   a box of cleaning supplies and a BOOMBOX from the back of the   Mercedes when something across the street catches her eye. 
Her POV: In front of a different house with much more curb appeal is another SIGN, featuring a picture of a handsome silver-haired MAN. It reads: 
Another One SOLD By Buddy Kane 
The Real Estate King 555-0100 
Carolyn frowns and slams the back of the Mercedes shut. 
INT. SALE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
The interior of this house is ugly, oppressive and tasteless. Carolyn opens the front door, breathes deeply and solemnly announces: 
CAROLYN I will sell this house today. 
She neatly arranges her sales materials on a desk, then strips down to her undergarments. 
MONTAGE: 
We see Carolyn, working with fierce concentration as she: 
Cleans glass doors that overlook the patio and pool; 
Doggedly scrubs countertops in the kitchen; 
Perches on a stepladder to dust a cheap-looking ceiling fan in the master bedroom; 
And vacuums a dirty carpet that will never be clean. 
Throughout all this, she keeps repeating to herself: 
CAROLYN (CONT'D) I will sell this house today. I will sell this house today. I will sell this house today. 
INT. SALE HOUSE - BATHROOM - LATER 
Carolyn stands in front of the mirror, wearing her suit once more, applying lipstick. She stares at her reflection critically. 
CAROLYN I will sell this house today. 
She says this as if it were a threat, then notices a smudge on the mirror and wipes it off. 
EXT. SALE HOUSE - FRONT YARD - LATER 
The front door opens to reveal Carolyn, greeting us with the smile she thinks could sell ice to an Eskimo. 
CAROLYN Welcome. I'm Carolyn Burnham! 
INT. SALE HOUSE - FOYER - CONTINUOUS 
Smiling, Carolyn leads a man and woman into the living room. They're thirtyish, and they've seen a lot of houses today. 
CAROLYN This living room is very dramatic. Wait 'til you see the native stone fireplace! 
The man and woman glance around the dark room, unimpressed. 
LESTER Well, I bet money she's going to resent it. And I'm missing the James Bond marathon on TNT. 
CAROLYN Lester, this is important. I'm sensing a real distance growing between you and Jane. 
LESTER Growing? She hates me. 
CAROLYN She's just willful. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
LESTER She hates you too. 
Carolyn stares at him, unsure of how to respond. 
INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - LATER 
The uniformed girls now stand in formation on the gym floor. 
ANNOUNCER (over P.A.) And now, for your half-time entertainment, Rockwell High's award- winning Dancing Spartanettes! 
In the crowded stands, Lester and Carolyn find seats. 
LESTER We can leave right after this, right? 
The HIGH SCHOOL BAND plays "ON BROADWAY." On the gym floor, the girls perform. They're well-rehearsed, but too young to carry off the ambitious Vegas routine they're attempting. 
Lester, watching from the stands, picks out his daughter. 
His POV: Jane performs well, concentrating. Dancing awkwardly next to her is Angela. Suddenly Angela looks right at us and smiles... a lazy, insolent smile. 
Lester leans forward in his seat. 
His POV: We're focused on Angela now. Everything starts to SLOW DOWN... the MUSIC acquires an eerie ECHO... 
We ZOOM slowly toward Lester as he watches, transfixed. 
His POV: Angela's awkwardness gives way to a fluid grace, and "ON BROADWAY" FADES into dreamy, hypnotic MUSIC. The light on Angela grows stronger, and the other girls DISAPPEAR entirely. 
Lester is suddenly alone in the stands, spellbound. 
His POV: Angela looks directly at us now, dancing only for Lester. Her movements take on a blatantly erotic edge as she starts to unzip her uniform, teasing us with an expression that's both innocent and knowing, then... she pulls her uniform OPEN and a profusion of RED ROSE PETALS spill forth... and we SMASH CUT TO: 
INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - CONTINUOUS 
Angela, fully clothed, is once again surrounded by the other girls. The HIGH SCHOOL BAND plays its last note, the Dancing Spartanettes strike their final pose, and the audience APPLAUDS. 
Carolyn claps along with the rest of the audience. Lester just sits there, unable to take his eyes off Angela. 
EXT. HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - LATER 
The game is long over. Jane and Angela come out of the gym. 
JANE Oh shit, they're still here. 
Her POV: Lester and Carolyn stand at the edge of the parking lot. 
LESTER Janie! 
CAROLYN Hi! I really enjoyed that! 
She crosses reluctantly toward her parents, followed by Angela. 
LESTER Congratulations, honey, you were great. 
JANE I didn't win anything. 
LESTER (to Angela) Hi, I'm Lester. Janie's dad. 
ANGELA Oh. Hi. 
An awkward beat. 
JANE This is my friend, Angela Hayes. 
LESTER Okay, good to meet you. You were also good tonight. Very... precise. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
On VIDEO: Jane gets out of the car, still LAUGHING, and waves as Angela pulls away. We ZOOM toward Jane as she walks up the driveway. She turns suddenly, sensing our presence. 
Her POV: We're looking at the COLONIAL HOUSE next door where the moving van was parked earlier. The front porch is shrouded in darkness... then a PORCH LIGHT abruptly reveals Ricky. As usual, he's dressed conservatively. There is a BEEPER attached to his belt, and his DIGICAM dangles loosely around his neck. 
Irritated, Jane stares at him, hard. 
JANE Asshole. 
He looks back at her curiously, then raises his Digicam and starts to videotape her. 
His POV, on VIDEO: Jane, angry and self-conscious, turns and walks quickly toward her house, flipping us off as she goes. 
INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - FOYER - CONTINUOUS 
Jane enters, closes and locks the door. She quickly TURNS OFF THE LIGHT that's been left on for her, then peeks through a window. 
Her POV: There's no sign of Ricky. 
Jane turns back into the room, her heart racing... and smiles. 
INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - JANE'S BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING 
CLOSE on an ADDRESS BOOK: A man's hand flips to the H page and then his finger stops at the name Angela Hayes. 
Lester, dressed for work, goes through Jane's address book. We HEAR the SHOWER running in the adjacent bathroom. He grabs Jane's phone and dials, then stands with the receiver to his ear, nervous. 
ANGELA (over phone line) Hello? Hello? 
Lester is frozen, unable to speak. Suddenly, the SHOWER is turned off in the next room. Lester hangs up and exits quickly. A moment, then the PHONE RINGS. Jane emerges from the bathroom, a towel wrapped around her torso, drying her wet hair. She picks up the PHONE. 
JANE Hello? 
INT. HAYES HOUSE - ANGELA'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Angela is sprawled across her bed, on the phone. 
ANGELA Why'd you call me? 
INTERCUT WITH JANE IN HER BEDROOM: 
JANE I didn't. 
ANGELA Well, my phone just rang and I answered it and somebody hung up and then I star sixty-nined and it called you back. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JANE I was in the shower. 
Then Jane notices her address book open to the H page. 
JANE (CONT'D) Oh, gross. 
EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
On VIDEO: We're across from Jane's WINDOW, looking in. Jane picks up the address book, frowning. She speaks into the phone, but we can't hear her. 
WOMAN'S VOICE (O.C.) (sing song) Rick-y! Break-fast! 
INT. FITTS HOUSE - RICKY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Ricky stands at his window, videotaping. He lowers his Digicam, but his eyes remain locked on Jane across the way. 
RICKY Be right there. 
INT. FITTS HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER 
BARBARA FITTS stands at the stove, flipping bacon strips mechanically, her eyes focused elsewhere. At least ten years younger than her husband, she's pretty in a June Cleaver-ish way. The Colonel sits at a dinette reading The Wall Street Journal. Ricky enters. 
RICKY Mom. 
Startled, Barbara turns to him. 
BARBARA Hello. 
As she attempts to serve him bacon: 
RICKY I don't eat bacon, remember? 
RICKY Yeah, you're right. 
The Colonel's eyes flash angrily. 
COLONEL Don't placate me like I'm your mother, boy. 
Ricky sighs, then looks at his father. 
RICKY Forgive me, sir, for speaking so bluntly, but those fags make me want to puke my fucking guts out. 
The Colonel is taken aback but quickly covers. 
COLONEL Me too, son. Me too. 
Case closed, Ricky goes back to his calculations. 
CLOSE on the pencil in his hands: He's totaling two columns of NUMBERS. Under the column "Income" he writes in swift, bold strokes: $24,950.00. 
EXT. HIGH SCHOOL CAMPUS - A SHORT TIME LATER 
Jane and Angela are standing with two other TEENAGE GIRLS. 
ANGELA I'm serious, he just pulled down his pants and yanked it out. You know, like, say hello to Mr. Happy. 
TEENAGE GIRL #1 
Gross. 
ANGELA It wasn't gross. It was kind of cool. 
TEENAGE GIRL #1 
So, did you do it with him? 
ANGELA Of course I did. He is a really well- known photographer? He shoots for Elle on like, a regular basis? It would have been so majorly stupid of me to turn him down. 
TEENAGE GIRL #2 
You are a total prostitute. 
ANGELA Hey. That's how things really are. You just don't know, because you're this pampered little suburban chick. 
TEENAGE GIRL #2 
So are you. You've only been in Seventeen once, and you looked fat, so stop acting like you're goddamn Christy Turlington. 
The two TEENAGE GIRLS move away from Jane and Angela. 
ANGELA (calling off) Cunt! (then) I am so sick of people taking their insecurities out on me. 
The Colonel's Ford Explorer pulls up, and Ricky gets out. 
JANE Oh my God. That's the pervert who filmed me last night. 
ANGELA Him? Jane. No way. He's a total lunatic. 
JANE You know him? 
ANGELA Yeah. We were on the same lunch shift when I was in ninth grade, and he would always say the most random, weird things, and then one day, he was just like, gone. And then, Connie Cardullo told me he his parents had to put him in a mental institution. 
JANE Why? What did he do? 
ANGELA What do you mean? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JANE Well, they can't put you away just for saying weird things. 
Angela stares at Jane, then her mouth widens into a smile. 
ANGELA You total slut. You've got a crush on him. 
JANE What? Please. 
ANGELA You were defending him! You love him. You want to have like, ten thousand of his babies. 
JANE Shut up. 
Jane suddenly finds Ricky standing in front of her. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
CAROLYN Very well, thank you. (to his wife) Hello, Christy. 
CHRISTY Hello. 
CAROLYN My husband, Lester-- 
BUDDY (shakes Lester's hand) It's a pleasure. 
LESTER Oh, we've met before, actually. This thing last year. Or the Christmas thing at the Sheraton. 
BUDDY Oh, yes. 
LESTER It's okay. I wouldn't remember me either. 
He LAUGHS. A little too loudly. Carolyn quickly joins in. 
CAROLYN (forced gaiety) Honey. Don't be weird. 
She smiles her most winning smile at him. He knows this persona well, only it's never pissed him off as much as it does right now. 
LESTER All right, honey. I won't be weird. (his face close to hers) I'll be whatever you want me to be. 
And he kisses her--a soft, warm kiss that speaks unmistakably of sex--then turns to the others and grins. 
LESTER (CONT'D) We have a very healthy relationship. 
BUDDY I see. 
Carolyn's smile is frozen on her face. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) 
LESTER Well. I don't know about you, but I need a drink. 
He crosses off. Carolyn, Buddy and Christy watch him go. 
INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Lester stands at the bar. A bartender pours him a drink. 
LESTER Whoa. Put a little more in there, cowboy. 
The bartender complies. Lester takes his drink and turns to face the center of the room. 
His POV: Carolyn is talking to Buddy and Christy. She's on: smiling, animated, LAUGHING too loud at their jokes. 
Lester shakes his head. Ricky approaches him, wearing a waiter's uniform, carrying a tray of empty glasses. 
RICKY Excuse me. Don't you live on Robin Hood Trail? The house with the red door? 
LESTER (suspicious) Yeah. 
RICKY I'm Ricky Fitts. I just moved into the house next to you. 
LESTER Oh. Hi, Ricky Fitts. I'm Lester Burnham. 
RICKY Hi, Lester Burnham. 
A beat. Lester looks away, scans the crowd, then downs the rest of his drink in one gulp. Ricky just stands there, watching him. Finally Lester turns back to Ricky: what does this kid want? 
RICKY (CONT'D) Do you party? 
LESTER Excuse me? 
RICKY Do you get high? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Lester's surprised, but instantly intrigued. 
INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Carolyn and Buddy are deep in conversation. Christy has wandered off. Carolyn is nervous; Buddy seems amused. 
She starts toward the kitchen. Jane doesn't like this. 
INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 
Lester enters and opens the refrigerator. 
ANGELA (O.C.) Nice suit. 
He turns, and is instantly transfixed by: 
His POV: Angela leans against the counter, twirling her hair. 
ANGELA (CONT'D) You're looking good, Mr. Burnham. 
She starts toward him. 
ANGELA (CONT'D) Last time I saw you, you looked kind of wound up. (spots something) Ooh, is that root beer? 
She reaches inside the refrigerator to grab a bottle. As she does, she moves to place her other hand casually on Lester's shoulder. He sees it coming. Everything SLOWS DOWN, and all sound FADES... 
EXTREME CLOSE UP on her hand as it briefly touches his shoulder in SLOW MOTION. We HEAR only the amplified BRUSH of her fingers against the fabric of his suit, and its unnatural, hollow ECHO... 
BACK IN REAL TIME: She grabs the root beer and smiles at him. 
CLOSE on Lester: his eyes narrow slightly, then: 
He cups her face in his hands and kisses her. She seems shocked, but doesn't resist as he pulls her toward him    with surprising strength. He breaks the kiss, looking at her    in awe, then he reaches up and touches his lips. His eyes    widen as he pulls a ROSE PETAL from his mouth right before we    SMASH CUT TO: 
INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 
Angela is back against the counter, drinking the root beer. Lester stands by the refrigerator, gazing at her, still lost in fantasy. 
ANGELA I love root beer, don't you? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Jane watches from the doorway to the family room, feeling incredibly awkward in her own home. Carolyn enters from the dining room. Lester snaps out of it and grabs a root beer from the refrigerator. 
JANE Mom, you remember Angela. 
CAROLYN (her sales smile) Yes, of course! 
JANE I forgot to tell you, she's spending the night. Is that okay? 
LESTER Sure! 
He takes a sip of his root beer, but it goes down the wrong way and he starts COUGHING violently. 
INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - JANE'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT 
Angela lays on the bed, in bra and panties, reading a magazine. Jane, in an oversized T shirt, plays a video game on her computer. 
JANE I'm sorry about my dad. 
ANGELA Don't be. I think it's funny. 
JANE Yeah, to you, he's just another guy who wants to jump your bones. But to me... he's just too embarrassing to live. 
ANGELA Your mom's the one who's embarrassing. What a phony. 
Jane glances at Angela, irritated. 
ANGELA (CONT'D) Your dad's actually kind of cute. 
JANE Shut up. 
INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 
Lester, still in his suit, stands outside Jane's room, his ear up against the door. He can't believe what he's hearing. 
ANGELA (O.C.) He is. If he just worked out a little, he'd be hot. 
INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - JANE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
JANE Shut up. 
ANGELA Oh, come on. Like you've never sneaked a peek at him in his underwear? I bet he's got a big dick. 
JANE You are so grossing me out right now. 
Ricky stands at the window, videotaping. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
RICKY Welcome to America's Weirdest Home Videos. 
Suddenly we HEAR someone trying to open a locked door. 
COLONEL (O.C.) Ricky! 
Moving swiftly, Ricky pulls the drapes shut and switches on a light. His room is a haven of high-tech. A state-of-the-art multimedia COMPUTER crowds his desk, and high-end STEREO and VIDEO EQUIPMENT line the shelves, as well as HUNDREDS OF CDs. There is easily twenty thousand dollars worth of equipment in this room. 
RICKY Coming, Dad. 
COLONEL (O.C.) You know I don't like locked doors in my house, boy. 
Ricky opens the door. The Colonel stands outside, eyeing him. 
RICKY I'm sorry, I must have locked it by accident. So what's up? 
The Colonel holds out a small PLASTIC CUP WITH A CAP. 
COLONEL I need a urine sample. 
RICKY Wow. It's been six months already. Can I give it to you in the morning? I just took a whiz. 
COLONEL Yeah, I suppose. (an awkward beat) Well. Good night, son. 
He disappears down the hall. Ricky smiles, shuts and locks his door. He puts the plastic cup on the shelf, then crosses to a MINI REFRIGERATOR in the corner of his room and takes out a cup-sized TUPPERWARE CONTAINER from the freezer, already filled with urine, albeit frozen, and places it on a saucer to thaw overnight. 
INT BURNHAM HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT 
Carolyn lies sleeping. Lester is awake, staring at the ceiling. After a moment, he gets up, taking care not to disturb Carolyn, and walks toward the bathroom. 
INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - MASTER BATH - CONTINUOUS 
Lester enters and switches on the LIGHT. The room is filled with STEAM. Lester looks around, confused, then focuses on: 
His POV: Across from us, in a PEDESTAL BATHTUB, is Angela. She smiles and beckons us, and we MOVE CLOSER. ROSE PETALS float on the surface of the water, obscuring her naked body. 
ANGELA I've been waiting for you. 
Lester kneels by the bathtub like a man in church. 
ANGELA (CONT'D) You've been working out, haven't you? I can tell. 
She arches her back and looks up at him provocatively. 
ANGELA (CONT'D) I was hoping you'd give me a bath... I'm very, very dirty. 
Lester gives her a hard look, then slowly slips his hand into the water between her legs. Her eyes widen and she throws her head back... and we SMASH CUT TO: 
INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
CLOSE on Carolyn, her eyes wide, listening to the rhythmic BRUSH of Lester's hand as he masturbates under the covers. 
She flips over and faces him. 
CAROLYN What are you doing? 
A beat. 
LESTER Nothing. 
Carolyn switches on the bedside LIGHT. 
CAROLYN You were masturbating. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
LESTER I was not. 
CAROLYN Yes, you were. 
He turns to her, trying to look innocent, then gives up. 
LESTER All right, so shoot me. I was whacking off. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
COLONEL (shakes) COLONEL Frank Fitts, U.S. Marine Corps. 
LESTER Whoa. Welcome to the neighborhood, sir. 
He salutes the Colonel good-naturedly, grinning. The Colonel doesn't think it's funny. An awkward beat. 
LESTER (CONT'D) So, Ricky, uh, I was thinking about the, uh... I was gonna... the movie we talked about... 
RICKY (quickly) Re-Animator. 
LESTER Yeah! 
RICKY You want to borrow it? (before Lester can answer) Okay, it's up in my room. Come on. 
He heads into the house. Lester waves at the Colonel, then follows him. The Colonel watches them go, his eyes dark. 
INT. FITTS HOUSE - RICKY'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Ricky enters, followed by Lester. 
RICKY Can you hold this for a sec? 
LESTER Sure. 
He gives the URINE SPECIMEN to Lester, then locks the door. 
RICKY I don't think my dad would try to come in when somebody else is here, but you never know. 
Ricky crosses to a bureau and opens a DRAWER. He takes clothing out and piles it on his bed. 
LESTER (re: urine sample) What is this? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
RICKY Urine. I have to take a drug test every six months to make sure I'm clean. 
LESTER Are you kidding? You just smoked with me last night. 
RICKY It's not mine. One of my clients is a nurse in a pediatrician's office. I cut her a deal, she keeps me in clean piss. 
Lester picks up a CD case from a shelf and examines it. 
LESTER You like Pink Floyd? 
RICKY I like a lot of music. 
LESTER Man, I haven't listened to this album in years. 
He shakes his head, then puts the CD case down. Ricky, having emptied the drawer, now removes a FALSE BOTTOM, revealing rows of MARIJUANA, tightly packed in ZIP-LOC BAGS. 
RICKY How much do you want? 
LESTER I don't know, it's been a while. How much is an ounce? 
RICKY (indicates bag) Well, this is totally decent, and it's three hundred. 
LESTER Wow. 
RICKY (indicates another bag) But this shit is top of the line. It's called G-13. Genetically engineered by the U.S. Government. Extremely potent. But a completely mellow high, no paranoia. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
LESTER Is that what we smoked last night? 
RICKY This is all I ever smoke. 
LESTER How much? 
RICKY Two grand. 
LESTER Jesus. Things have changed since 1973. 
RICKY You don't have to pay now. I know you're good for it. 
LESTER One year's salary, with benefits. 
BRAD That's not going to happen. 
LESTER Well, what do you say I throw in a little sexual harassment charge to boot? 
Brad LAUGHS. 
BRAD Against who? 
LESTER Against you. 
Brad stops laughing. 
LESTER (CONT'D) Can you prove you didn't offer to save my job if I'd let you blow me? 
Brad leans back in his chair, studying Lester. 
BRAD Man. You are one twisted fuck. 
LESTER (standing) Nope. I'm just an ordinary guy with nothing to lose. 
INT. OFFICE BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER 
Exhilarated, Lester walks down a corridor, his belongings in a box on his shoulder. He's happier than he's been in years. 
LESTER Yeah! 
INT. RESTAURANT - LATER THAT DAY 
Carolyn sits at a table, lost in thought. There are two menus on the table. After a moment, Buddy Kane, the Real Estate King, joins her. Carolyn immediately becomes warm and gracious. 
BUDDY Carolyn. 
CAROLYN Buddy. 
Carolyn smiles, genuinely touched that he remembers her name. 
BUDDY I'm so sorry I kept you waiting. Christy left for New York this morning, and... let's just say things were very hectic around the house. 
CAROLYN What's she doing in New York? 
BUDDY She's moving there. (off Carolyn's look) Yes. We are splitting up. 
CAROLYN Buddy. I'm so sorry. 
BUDDY (bitterly) Yes, according to her, I'm too focused on my career. As if being driven to succeed is some sort of character flaw. Well, she certainly knew how to take advantage of the lifestyle my success afforded her. Oh. Wow. (then, laughing) Ah, it's for the best. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
CAROLYN When I saw you two at the party the other night, you seemed perfectly happy. 
BUDDY Well, call me crazy, but it is my philosophy that in order to be successful, one must project an image of success, at all times. 
He smiles, then opens his menu. Carolyn picks hers up mechanically, but continues to stare at him, enraptured, like a fervent Christian who's just come face to face with Jesus. 
EXT. HIGH SCHOOL CAMPUS - LATER THAT DAY 
Ricky stands with his DIGICAM, videotaping something on the ground at his feet. 
On VIDEO: A DEAD BIRD lays on the ground, decomposing. 
ANGELA (O.C.) What are you doing? 
On VIDEO: The camera JERKS up to discover Jane and Angela staring at us. 
RICKY (O.C.) I was filming this dead bird. 
ANGELA Why? 
RICKY (O.C.) Because it's beautiful. 
On VIDEO: Angela looks at Jane, trying not to laugh. 
ANGELA I think maybe you forgot your medication today, mental boy. 
On VIDEO: She falls out of frame as we ZOOM toward Jane. 
RICKY (O.C.) Hi, Jane. 
DRIVE-THRU GIRL (CONT'D) Smile, you're at Mr. Smiley's, that'll be four eighty-nine, please. 
Lester pays her. As she hands him his food, he notices a SIGN in the corner of the window that reads: 
NOW TAKING APPLICATIONS 
COUNTER GIRL Would you like some Smiley Sauce? 
LESTER No. No, actually... I'd like to fill out an application. 
She stares at him, confused by his age and attire. 
COUNTER GIRL There's not jobs for manager, it's just for counter. 
LESTER Good. I'm looking for the least possible amount of responsibility. 
INT. MR. SMILEY'S - A SHORT TIME LATER 
Lester sits at a booth with the MANAGER, a greasy kid wearing a white short sleeve shirt and a tie covered with the Mr. Smiley's logo. He looks over Lester's application, baffled. 
MANAGER I don't think you'd fit in here. 
LESTER I have fast food experience. 
MANAGER Yeah, like twenty years ago. 
LESTER Well, I'm sure there have been amazing technological advances in the industry, but surely you have some sort of training process. It seems unfair to presume I won't be able to learn. 
The Manager sighs and runs a hand through his greasy hair, wondering what he could possibly have done to deserve this. 
INT. TOP HAT MOTEL - LATER THAT DAY 
Carolyn and Buddy are in bed, post-sex. 
CAROLYN That was exactly what I needed. The royal treatment, so to speak. 
They laugh. 
CAROLYN (CONT'D) I was so stressed out. 
BUDDY Know what I do when I feel like that? 
CAROLYN What? 
BUDDY I fire a gun. 
Carolyn sits up, eager to learn from the master. 
CAROLYN (intrigued) Really. 
BUDDY Oh yeah, I go to this little firing range downtown, and I just pop off a few rounds. 
CAROLYN (embarrassed) I've never fired a gun before. 
BUDDY Oh, you've gotta try it. Nothing makes you feel more powerful. (smiles seductively) Well, almost nothing. 
Carolyn is quick to pick up her cue and kisses him, ready for another round. 
EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - LATER THAT DAY 
Ricky and Jane walk along without speaking. He seems comfortable with the silence; she doesn't. After a beat: 
JANE So how do you like your new house? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
RICKY I like it. 
A beat. 
JANE The people who used to live there fed these stray cats, so they were always around, and it drove my mother nuts. And then she cut down their tree. 
An automobile FUNERAL PROCESSION appears and begins to pass them slowly. 
RICKY Have you ever known anybody who died? 
JANE No. (a beat) Have you? 
RICKY No, but I did see this homeless woman who froze to death once. Just laying there on the sidewalk. She looked really sad. 
RICKY (concerned) No, you're scared of me. 
JANE No I'm not. 
But she is. Ricky studies her. 
RICKY You want to see the most beautiful thing I've ever filmed? 
INT. FITTS HOUSE - RICKY'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
On VIDEO: We're in an empty parking lot on a cold, gray day. Something is floating across from us... it's an empty, wrinkled, white PLASTIC BAG. We follow it as the wind carries it in a circle around us, sometimes whipping it about violently, or, without warning, sending it soaring skyward, then letting it float gracefully down to the ground... 
Jane and Ricky sit on the bed, watching his WIDE-SCREEN TV. 
RICKY It was one of those days when it's a minute away from snowing. And there's this electricity in the air, you can almost hear it, right? And this bag was just... dancing with me. Like a little kid begging me to play with it. For fifteen minutes. That's the day I realized that there was this entire life behind things, and this incredibly benevolent force that wanted me to know there was no reason to be afraid. Ever. 
A beat. 
RICKY (CONT'D) Video's a poor excuse, I know. But it helps me remember... I need to remember... 
Now Jane is watching him. 
RICKY (CONT'D) (distant) Sometimes there's so much beauty in the world I feel like I can't take it... and my heart is going to cave in. 
After a moment, Jane takes his hand. Then she leans in and kisses him softly on the lips. His eyes scan hers, curious to see how she reacts to this... 
JANE (suddenly) Oh my God. What time is it? 
INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Lester sits at the table in sloppy clothes, eating his dinner voraciously and drinking beer from a bottle. Across from him, Carolyn picks at her food, watching him with contempt. EASY- LISTENING MUSIC plays on the STEREO. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
We HEAR the back door SLAM, then Jane enters and quickly takes her seat at the table. 
JANE Sorry I'm late. 
CAROLYN (overly cheerful) No, no, that's quite all right, dear. Your father and I were just discussing his day at work. (to Lester) Why don't you tell our daughter about it, honey? 
Jane stares at both her parents, apprehensive. Lester looks at Carolyn darkly, then flashes a "you-asked-for-it" grin. 
LESTER Janie, today I quit my job. And then I told my boss to fuck himself, and then I blackmailed him for almost sixty thousand dollars. Pass the asparagus. 
CAROLYN Your father seems to think this kind of behavior is something to be proud of. 
LESTER And your mother seems to prefer I go through life like a fucking prisoner while she keeps my dick in a mason jar under the sink. 
CAROLYN (ashen) How dare you speak to me that way in front of her? And I marvel that you can be so contemptuous of me, on the same day that you lose your job! 
LESTER Lose it? I didn't lose it. It's not like, "Oops, where'd my job go?" I quit. Someone pass me the asparagus. 
CAROLYN Oh! Oh! And I want to thank you for putting me under the added pressure of being the sole breadwinner now-- 
LESTER I already have a job. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
CAROLYN (not stopping) No, no, don't give a second thought as to who's going to pay the mortgage. We'll just leave it all up to Carolyn. You mean, you're going to take care of everything now, Carolyn? Yes. I don't mind. I really don't. You mean, everything? You don't mind having the sole responsibility, your husband feels he can just quit his job-- 
LESTER (overlapping) Will someone pass me the fucking asparagus? 
JANE (rises) Okay, I'm not going to be a part of this-- 
LESTER (means it) Sit down. 
Jane does so, surprised and intimidated by the power in his voice. Lester gets up, crosses to the other side of the table to get a PLATE OF ASPARAGUS, then sits again as he serves himself. 
LESTER (CONT'D) I'm sick and tired of being treated    like I don't exist. You two do whatever    you want to do whenever you want to do    it and I don't complain. All I want is the    same courtesy-- 
CAROLYN (overlapping) Oh, you don't complain? Oh, excuse me. Excuse me. I must be psychotic then, if you don't complain. What is this?! Am I locked away in a padded cell somewhere, hallucinating? That's the only explanation I can think of-- 
Lester hurls the plate of asparagus against the wall with such force it SHATTERS, frightening Carolyn and Jane. 
LESTER (casual) Don't interrupt me, honey. 
(CONTINUED) 
RICKY No, sir. I wanted to show my girlfriend your Nazi plate. 
A beat. 
COLONEL Girlfriend? 
RICKY Yes, sir. She lives next door. 
The Colonel glances toward the window. 
His POV: In the WINDOW across from us, Jane peeks out from behind the drape. She quickly pulls it shut. 
RICKY (CONT'D) Her name's Jane. 
A beat. The Colonel is suddenly, deeply shamed. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
COLONEL This is for your own good, boy. You have no respect for other people's things, for authority, for... 
RICKY Sir, I'm sorry. 
COLONEL You can't just go around doing whatever you feel like, you can't--there are rules in life-- 
RICKY Yes, sir. 
COLONEL You need structure, you need discipline-- 
RICKY (simultaneous) Discipline. Yes, sir, thank you for trying to teach me. Don't give up on me, Dad. 
The Colonel stands, still breathing heavily. Tenderness fills his face, and he reaches out to touch Ricky's cheek. 
COLONEL Oh, Ricky... 
But something keeps him from doing it. 
COLONEL (CONT'D) You stay out of there. 
He leaves. Ricky gets up and goes to his bureau. He looks at his reflection in the mirror, calmly takes a cloth and starts to wipe the blood from his face. 
FADE TO BLACK. 
In darkness, we HEAR repetitive GUNSHOTS. 
FADE IN: 
INT. INDOOR FIRING RANGE - ONE MONTH LATER 
Carolyn, wearing PROTECTIVE HEADGEAR, is holding a GLOCK 19 AUTOMATIC REVOLVER with both hands, FIRING it directly at us. 
She empties a round and stands there, exhilarated. An ATTENDANT approaches with a new round of ammunition. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
ATTENDANT (loading gun) I gotta say, Mrs. Burnham, when you first came here I thought you would be hopeless. But you're a natural. 
CAROLYN Well, all I know is... I love shooting this gun! 
And she starts FIRING again. 
INT. MERCEDES-BENZ ML320 - LATER 
Bobby Darin sings "DON'T RAIN ON MY    PARADE" on the RADIO. Carolyn SINGS along as she drives.    Her face has lost its usual resolute determination; she's    actually enjoying herself spontaneously, and the lack of her    usual self-consciousness allows us to see just how beautiful    she is. 
ANGLE ON the GLOCK 19 sitting on the passenger seat amidst some CDs. 
Carolyn takes the gun and holds it at arm's length, admiring it as she continues to SING. 
EXT. ROBIN HOOD TRAIL - CONTINUOUS 
The Mercedes turns onto Robin Hood Trail. 
INT. MERCEDES-BENZ ML320 - CONTINUOUS 
Carolyn's POV: We turn into the Burnham driveway. A 1970 PONTIAC FIREBIRD with racing stripes blocks our access to the garage. 
CLOSE on Carolyn: She doesn't like having things in her way. 
JANE I'm not going to sit here for that shit. 
She gets out of bed, takes his Digicam and focuses it on him. We see his image on the TV as she videotapes. 
JANE (CONT'D) Ha. How does it feel now? 
RICKY Fine. 
JANE You don't feel naked? 
RICKY I am naked. 
JANE You know what I mean. 
Jane ZOOMS in on his face, which remains placid. 
JANE (CONT'D) Tell me about being in the hospital. 
Ricky smiles. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
RICKY When I was fifteen, my dad caught me smoking dope. He totally freaked and decided to send me to military school. I told you his whole thing about structure and discipline, right? (laughs) Well, of course, I got kicked out. Dad and I had this huge fight, and he hit me... and then the next day at school, some kid made a crack about my haircut, and... I just snapped. I wanted to kill him. And I would have. Killed him. If they hadn't pulled me off. (then) That's when my dad put me in the hospital. Then they drugged me up and left me in there for two years. 
JANE Wow. You must really hate him. 
RICKY He's not a bad man. 
He grabs a half-smoked JOINT from an ashtray and lights it. 
JANE Well... you better believe I'd hate my father if he did something like that to me. (laughs) Wait. I do hate my father. 
RICKY Why? 
He passes her the joint, then takes the Digicam and focuses it on her. We see her image on the TV as he videotapes. 
JANE He's a total asshole and he's got this crush on my friend Angela and it's disgusting. 
RICKY You'd rather he had the crush on you? 
JANE Gross, no! But it'd be nice if I was anywhere near as important to him as she is. (then) (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) JANE (CONT'D) I know you think my dad's harmless, but you're wrong. He's doing massive psychological damage to me. 
RICKY How? 
Jane looks into the camera, a loopy, stoned grin on her face. 
JANE Well, now, I too need structure. A little fucking discipline. 
They LAUGH. She lays back on the bed. 
JANE (CONT'D) I'm serious, though. How could he not be damaging me? I need a father who's a role model, not some horny geek-boy who's gonna spray his shorts whenever I bring a girlfriend home from school. (snorts) What a lame-o. Somebody really should put him out of his misery. 
Her mind wanders for a beat. 
RICKY Want me to kill him for you? 
Jane looks at him and sits up. 
JANE Yeah, would you? 
RICKY (smiles) It'll cost you. 
JANE Well, I've been baby-sitting since I was about ten. I've got almost three thousand dollars. 'Course, I was saving it up for a boob job. 
She stands and sticks out her breasts, then falls back on the bed, LAUGHING. 
JANE (CONT'D) But my tits can wait, huh? 
RICKY You know, that's not a very nice thing to do, hiring somebody to kill your dad. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (4) 
JANE Well, I guess I'm just not a very nice girl, then, am I? 
She smiles dreamily at him. He turns the Digicam off and the TV screen goes BLUE. He lowers the camera and looks at her intently. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
CLOSE on the Colonel's face: he looks confused. 
As the Mercedes backs out of the driveway, Lester glances over at him. 
Lester's POV: The Colonel watches the car driving off, then looks at us. His face tightens. 
LESTER studies him for a moment, then grins and salutes before going inside the house. 
CLOSE on the Colonel, deeply troubled. 
INT. FITTS HOUSE - RICKY'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
The door swings open silently and the Colonel enters. He starts going through Ricky's bureau. He opens the DRAWER in which we know Ricky keeps his marijuana, but he doesn't discover its false bottom. He stands and looks around, his eyes finally landing on: 
The DIGICAM and a stack of CASSETTES on a shelf. The camera is still connected to the TV. 
The Colonel turns on the TV, examines the Digicam and presses "play." The TV's blank screen suddenly gives way to... 
On VIDEO: Barbara Fitts sits at the kitchen table, staring off into space. 
The Colonel watches, at first baffled, then impatient. He takes the cassette out of the Digicam and inserts another. On the TV screen we see... 
On VIDEO: Through the Burnham's GARAGE WINDOW, we see Lester step out of his pants and briefs. Then, naked except for his black socks, he grabs the dumbbells and starts lifting them, watching his reflection in the window as he does... 
The Colonel sinks slowly onto Ricky's bed, mesmerized. 
INT. MR. SMILEY'S - LATER 
Lester, wearing a Mr. Smiley's uniform, is happily flipping burgers on a grill. 
CO-WORKER Hey Lester, I need that Super Smiley with cheese, A.S.A.P. 
LESTER You need more than that, my little hombre. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Lester looks up suddenly when he HEARS: 
CAROLYN (O.S.) (over speakers) What's good here? 
BUDDY (O.C.) (over speakers) Nothing. 
CAROLYN (O.C.) (over speakers) Then I guess we'll just have to be bad, won't we? (then) I think I'll have a double Smiley Sandwich and curly fries, and a vanilla shake. 
BUDDY (O.C.) (over speakers) Make that two. 
COUNTER GIRL (O.C.) (over speakers) Please drive around thank you. 
Lester's face darkens, then... he smiles. He puts his spatula down. 
EXT. MR. SMILEY'S - CONTINUOUS 
The Mercedes pulls around to the DRIVE-THRU WINDOW. Carolyn drives; Buddy sits beside her. 
CAROLYN I think we deserve a little junk food, after the workout we had this morning. 
BUDDY (nuzzles her neck) I'm flattered. 
They are too involved with each other to notice Lester watching them from the drive-thru window. 
LESTER (overly cheerful) Smile! You're at Mr. Smiley's! 
Carolyn almost jumps out of her skin. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Lester leans out of the drive-thru window, grinning at her, holding bags filled with fast food. The Counter Girl stands next to him, staring blankly. 
LESTER    (CONT'D) Would you like to    try our new beef and cheese pot pie on    a stick, just a dollar ninety-nine for a    limited time only? 
Carolyn struggles to appear nonchalant. 
CAROLYN (re: Buddy) We were just at a seminar. (then, all business) Buddy, this is my-- 
CONTINUED: 
JANE Yeah, and maybe you shouldn't, all right? Maybe I don't really want to hear all that. 
ANGELA Oh, so now that you have a boyfriend, you're like, above it? (rolls her eyes) We gotta get you a real man. 
INT. FITTS HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 
The Colonel rinses off his plate at the sink. Something outside catches his eye, and he cranes his neck to get a better look at... 
His POV: Through the window over the sink, we can see into the Burnham's GARAGE WINDOW. Our view is blurred by the RAIN, but we see Lester, his upper body pumped and glistening in sweat as he counts out a wad of BILLS... and then Ricky walks into view. 
The Colonel's face tightens. 
His POV: Lester drapes his arm around Ricky as he gives him the money. We can only see Lester from the waist up, so he looks naked. 
INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - GARAGE - CONTINUOUS 
Ricky, his hair wet from the rain, puts the cash in his pocket. Lester's arm remains draped around his shoulder. 
RICKY (grins) You got any papers? 
LESTER Yeah, in the cigar box, right over there. (laughs) You know, put up a fight, dude! You are such a pushover. "No I can't. Really. Okay." 
And he slaps Ricky playfully on the chest. Ricky grins, then squats down and reaches under the weight bench. 
RICKY You should learn to roll a joint. 
Lester sits in the bowl chair and leans back, his hands behind his head, watching Ricky roll the joint. 
INT. FITTS HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 
The Colonel's POV: Lester leans back in his chair. We see only Ricky's back and shoulders as he rolls the joint. After a beat, Lester's jaw drops, then he throws his head back. From our perspective, it looks very much like Ricky is giving Lester a blow job. 
The Colonel watches, incredulous. Then we HEAR a CAR APPROACHING, and the Colonel glances over at: 
His POV: Angela's BMW pulls into the driveway, stopping behind Lester's Firebird. As Angela and Jane get out and run toward the house, our focus MOVES back to the GARAGE WINDOW. Ricky stands, looking a little panicked. Lester pulls on his T-shirt, and both he and Ricky cross out of view. 
INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER 
Lester leans nonchalantly against the counter. Jane and Angela enter. Jane frowns when she sees him. 
LESTER Oh. Hi. 
JANE Where's Mom? 
LESTER Don't know. 
ANGELA Hi, Mr. Burnham. 
LESTER Hi. 
He's trying to remain cool, and doing a pretty good job. 
ANGELA Wow. Look at you. Have you been working out? 
LESTER Some. 
Jane rolls her eyes and exits. Angela walks over to Lester. 
ANGELA You can really tell. Look at those arms. 
She places her hand on his arm flirtatiously, looks up at him and smiles, fully expecting to intimidate him by doing so. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
But something has changed, and he isn't intimidated at all. He looks directly back at her, leans in and smiles slowly. 
LESTER You like muscles? 
His voice is low and intense. She moves away, suddenly insecure. 
ANGELA I--I should probably go see what Jane's up to. 
And she heads out quickly. Lester watches her go, baffled. 
INT. FITTS HOUSE - RICKY'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Ricky enters, wet from the pouring rain, and crosses to his bureau, pulling the wad of CASH out of his pocket as he goes. 
The Colonel stares at the floor, blinking, and then he turns and runs out the open garage door into the rainy night. 
INT. MERCEDES-BENZ ML320 - CONTINUOUS 
Carolyn is still listening to the same MOTIVATIONAL TAPE. She holds the GLOCK in her hand. 
TAPE VOICE "I refuse to be a victim." When this becomes your mantra, constantly running through your head-- 
Carolyn switches the TAPE OFF and puts the gun in her purse. 
CAROLYN I refuse to be a victim. 
EXT. FREEWAY - CONTINUOUS 
The Mercedes pulls away from the shoulder. 
INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 
Lester enters, opens the refrigerator and grabs a BEER. Suddenly we HEAR MUSIC coming from the other room. Lester opens his beer and starts toward the family room. 
INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
His POV: AS we MOVE SLOWLY around a corner, Angela comes into view, standing at the STEREO, holding a CD case. She's been crying; her face is puffy, and her hair mussed. She regards us apprehensively... then puts on a slightly defiant smile. 
ANGELA I hope you don't mind if I play the stereo. 
Lester leans against the wall and takes a swig of his beer. 
LESTER Not at all. (then) Bad night? 
ANGELA Not really bad, just... strange. 
LESTER (grins) Believe me. It couldn't possibly be any stranger than mine. 
She smiles. They stand there in silence; the atmosphere is charged. 
ANGELA Jane and I had a fight. (after a beat) It was about you. 
She's trying to be seductive as she says this, but she's pretty bad at it. Lester raises his eyebrows. 
ANGELA (CONT'D) She's mad at me because I said I think you're sexy. 
Lester grins. He is sexy. 
LESTER (offering beer) Do you want a sip? 
She nods. Lester holds the bottle up to her mouth and she drinks clumsily. He gently wipes her chin with the back of his hand. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
LESTER (CONT'D) So... are you going to tell me? What you want? 
ANGELA I don't know. 
LESTER You don't know? 
His face is very close to hers. She's unnerved--this is happening too fast... 
ANGELA What do you want? 
LESTER Are you kidding? I want you. I've wanted you since the first moment I saw you. You are the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. 
Angela takes a deep breath just before Lester leans in to kiss her cheek, her forehead, her eyelids, her neck... 
ANGELA You don't think I'm ordinary? 
LESTER You couldn't be ordinary if you tried. 
ANGELA Thank you. (far away) I don't think there's anything worse than being ordinary... 
And Lester kisses her on the lips. 
INT. MERCEDES-BENZ ML320 - CONTINUOUS 
Carolyn drives, her face resolute. 
CAROLYN I refuse to be a victim. I refuse to be a victim. I refuse to be a victim... (angry) Lester, I have something I have to say to you... 
INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Lester puts a jar of mayonnaise back in the refrigerator. 
LESTER Do you want me to make you another one? 
ANGELA No, no, no. I'm fine. 
He turns to her and cocks an eyebrow. 
LESTER (concerned) You sure? 
ANGELA I mean, I'm still a little weirded out, but... (sincerely) ...I feel better. Thanks. 
A long beat, as Lester studies her, then: 
LESTER How's Jane? 
ANGELA What do you mean? 
LESTER I mean, how's her life? Is she happy? Is she miserable? I'd really like to know, and she'd die before she'd ever tell me about it. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Angela shifts uncomfortably. 
ANGELA She's... she's really happy. She thinks she's in love. 
Angela rolls her eyes at how silly this notion is. 
LESTER (quietly) Good for her. 
An awkward beat. 
ANGELA How are you? 
LESTER (smiles, taken aback) God, it's been a long time since anybody asked me that. (thinks about it) I'm great. 
They just sit there, smiling at each other, then: 
ANGELA (suddenly) I've gotta go to the bathroom. 
She crosses off. Lester watches her go, then stands there wondering why he should suddenly feel so content. 
LESTER (laughs) I'm great. 
Something at the edge of the counter catches his eye, and he reaches for... 
CLOSE on a framed PHOTOGRAPH as he picks it up: It's the photo we saw earlier of him, Carolyn and Jane, taken several years ago at an amusement park. It's startling how happy they look. 
Lester crosses to the kitchen table, where he sits and studies the photo. He suddenly seems older, more mature... and then he smiles: the deep, satisfied smile of a man who just now understands the punch line of a joke he heard long ago... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
LESTER (CONT'D) Man oh man... (softly) Man oh man oh man... 
After a beat, the barrel of a GUN rises up behind his head, aimed at the base of his skull. 
ANGLE ON an arrangement of fresh-cut ROSES   in a vase on the opposite counter, deep crimson against the   WHITE TILE WALL. Then a GUNSHOT suddenly rings out, ECHOING   unnaturally. Instantly, the tile is sprayed with BLOOD,   the same deep crimson as the roses. 
INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - FOYER - MOMENTS LATER 
Ricky comes down the stairs, followed by Jane. 
INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER 
Ricky opens the door from the dining room, then stops. Jane appears behind him. 
JANE Oh God. 
Their POV: A pool of blood is forming on the kitchen table. 
Ricky comes into the kitchen and slowly approaches Lester's lifeless body, wide-eyed but not afraid. Jane follows him, in shock. Ricky kneels, gazing at Lester's unseen face... then he smiles, ever so slightly. 
His POV: Lester looks back at us; his eyes are lifeless, but he's smiling the same slight smile. 
RICKY (an awed whisper) Wow. 
LESTER (V.O.) I had always heard your entire life flashes in front of your eyes the second before you die.

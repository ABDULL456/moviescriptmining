1 OVER BLACK... 1 A distinctly SOUTHERN VOICE... 
LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE There's a moment of orderly silence before a football play begins. Players are in position, linemen are frozen, and anything's possible. Then, like a traffic accident, stuff begins to randomly collide. From the snap of the ball to the snap of the first bone is closer to four seconds than five. 
2 EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD/GAME FOOTAGE - NIGHT 2 
We're watching footage of the 1985 Redskins/Giants Monday Night Football game. Lots of angles, faces, knuckles as the two teams line up, Redskins on offense, for the snap of the ball. As the play begins -- 
LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE One Mississippi. Joe Theismann, the Redskins quarterback, takes the snap and hands off to his running back. JOE THEISMANN hands off to JOHN RIGGINS, who takes two steps forward, then turns and tosses the ball back'to Theismann. The footage PAUSES AND PLAYS like a coach breaking down film. 
LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE (CONT'D) Two Mississippi. It's a trick play, a flea flicker, and the running back tosses the ball back to the quarterback. HARRY CARSON, the Giants linebacker sees that Theismann has the ball back and races toward him. Theismann steps up and to the side and Carson flies past. 
LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE (CONT'D) Three Mississippi. Up to now the play's been defined by what the quarterback sees. It's about to be defined by what he doesn't. LAWRENCE TAYLOR carves a wide circle around the Redskins lineman trying to block him. 
(CONTINUED) 
2 CONTINUED: 2 The blocker dives frantically. at Taylor's ankles, and misses. Taylor leaps, arms raised, filling the sky behind Theismann. The image FREEZES. 
LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE (CONT'D) Four Mississippi. Lawrence Taylor is the best defensive player in the NFL and has been from the time he stepped onto the field as a rookie. The frozen image of Taylor comes to life as he jackknifes Theismann's body. PLAYERS' FACES react to what they're seeing. Devastating. TAYLOR pops up from the pile and jumps around like a madman. 
LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE (CONT'D) He will also change the game of football as we know it. WE ARE WATCHING the MNF feed and hear the ANNOUNCER'S VOICES. 
FRANK GIFFORD (V.0.) Again, we'll look at it with the reverse angle one more time. And I suggest if your stomach is weak you just don't watch. 
LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE Joe Theissman never played another down of football. 
3 TEAM PHOTO OF THE 2005 SEATTLE SEAHAWKS 3 
LEIGH ANNE'S. VOICE Now, y'all would guess that more often than not the highest paid player on an NFL team is the quarterback. The camera finds MATT HASSELBECK, Seattle's quarterback. 
LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE (CONT'D) And you'd be right. What you probably don't know is that more often than not the second highest paid player is, thanks to Lawrence Taylor, a left tackle. The camera goes to WALTER JONES, Seattle's left tackle. 
(CONTINUED) 
3 CONTINUED: 3 
LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE (CONT'D) Because, as every housewife knows, the first check you write is for the mortgage and the second is for the insurance. The left tackle's job is to protect the quarterback from what he can't see coming. To protect his blind side. 
4 SERIES OF SHOTS 4 "Famous" left tackles - Jonathan Ogden, Orlando Pace, Andre Gurode. Then we SEE SHOTS of their hands, feet, waists, etc., corresponding with --- 
LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE The ideal left tackle is big, but a lot of people are big. He is wide in the butt and massive in the thighs. He has long arms, giant hands and feet as quick as a hiccup. 
EXT. WEST MEMPHIS -- DAY 5 
A street anchored by project housing and littered with broken down cars and ne'er-do-wells. Lots of folks out, milling about, but our focus is on A TEENAGER in the distance, moving TOWARD US in SLO-MO while everyone else is at normal speed. He's extremely large, six and a half feet, but he carefully steps instead of strutting. His name is MICHAEL OHER. 
LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE This is a rare and expensive combination the need for which can be traced to that Monday night game and Lawrence. Taylor. For on that day he not only altered Joe Theismann's life, but mine as well. As Michael continues toward us he begins to go OUT OF FOCUS -- 
INVESTIGATOR'S VOICE (V.O.) Mr. Oher, do you know why I'm here? 
(NO RESPONSE) Mr. Oher?... 
MICHAEL (V.0.) 
(CONTINUED) 
5 CONTINUED: 5 
INVESTIGATOR'S.VOICE (V.O.) Do you know, do you understand why I'm here? 
MICHAEL (V.0.) To... investigate. 
INVESTIGATOR'S VOICE (V.0.) Yes. To investigate. I'm here to investigate your odd... predicament. 
6 INT. NONDESCRIPT ROOM - DAY 6 
Looks like a government office. Not much more than a desk on either side of which sit INVESTIGATOR GRANGER, an African- American woman in a business suit, and Michael Oher. Michael slumps a bit, eyes the ground and rubs his hands on his knees - a nervous trait of his. 
GRANGER Do you find it odd? Your predicament? 
(NO RESPONSE) Michael?... 
MICHAEL Iono [I don't know]... Investigator Granger sifts through her briefcase, pulls out files, documents - a good bit of evidence for whatever trouble Michael is in. She sits back, stares at Michael, as if trying to figure him out. Michael can't meet her gaze. He looks out the window, rubs his knees some more. 
MICHAEL (CONT'D) Can I... can I leave now? 
GRANGER 
(WITH FINALITY) No. You can't. 
LEIGH ANNE What's so awful about our house? Sean smiles, shakes his head as SJ and Collins leave. 
(CONTINUED) 
26 CONTINUED: 26 Sean's eyes go to the upper stands where he sees Michael, alone, walking slowly, then bending down, picking something up, taking a few more steps and repeating the process. Picking up left-over bags of popcorn. Sean considers this for a second before leaving. 
27 INT. WINGATE - TEACHER'S LOUNGE - DAY 27 
Teachers drink stale coffee and chew on donuts. 
FIRST TEACHER (BOB) Well, the big guy's been here a month and he ain't cutting it in my class. 
SECOND TEACHER (APRIL) Why would Admissions do this? It's not fair to us or the boy. 
THIRD TEACHER (GLENDA) Just setting him up to fail. 
BOB I don't think he has any idea what I'm teaching. 
GLENDA And how would you know if he did? He won't even talk. Mrs. Boswell can't contain herself. 
MRS. BOSWELL He writes. 
APRIL His name. Barely. Mrs. Boswell goes to'her purse, pulls out a crumpled page. 
MRS. BOSWELL He threw this in the trash can. (reads from the page) "I look and I see white everywhere: white walls, white floors, and a lot of white people. The teachers do not know I have no idea of anything they are talking about. I do not want to listen to anyone, especially the teachers. 
(MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
27 CONTINUED: 27 
MRS. BOSWELL (CONT'D) They are giving homework and expecting me to do the problems on my own. I have never done homework in my life. I go to the bathroom, look in the mirror and say, "This is not Michael Oher." (a pause for effect) He entitled it "White Walls." The room is dead quiet. 
BOB How's the spelling? Mrs. Boswell stuffs the page back in her purse and leaves. 
28 INT. WINGATE - CAFETERIA -- DAY 28 
Sean and Coach Cotton sip coffee while all around them students eat their lunches. They are looking at Michael, who sits by himself without a tray in front of him. 
COTTON If he makes his grades he'll be eligible in the spring. 
SEAN If he makes his grades. 
COTTON But boy-hidey, just look at him. Cotton is admiring Michael's size but Sean sees something else. He stands, walks over to Michael, who barely looks up. 
SEAN What did you eat for lunch today? 
MICHAEL Here in the cafeteria. 
SEAN I didn't ask where you ate, I asked what you ate. 
MICHAEL A few things. 
SEAN Do you need some money? For lunch? 
(CONTINUED) 
28 CONTINUED: 28 
MICHAEL I don't need any. Sean walks back over to Coach Cotton. 
SEAN Buy him a semester lunch pass and put it on my bill. (off Cotton's look) He's hungry. 
COTTON You could tell that by looking at him? 
SEAN - I didn't grow up all that different from him. At public school they 
give you free lunch, Bert. And when food is finite, you'd be surprised how much time you can spend thinking about it.. 
29 INT. WINGATE - MRS. BOSWELL'S CLASS - DAY 29 
Mrs. Boswell distributes a test to the class. 
MRS. BOSWELL You'll have one hour. If you finish early put it on my desk and sit quietly. She looks at the class as they begin to work, then sees Michael just staring at his test. She sighs, makes a decision, rises and walks over. 
MRS. BOSWELL (CONT`D) Mike, come with me. 
30 INT. WINGATE - SMALL ADJACENT ROOM - DAY 30 
Filled with supplies and a small desk. Mrs. Boswell points and he sits. 
MRS. BOSWELL You can take the test back here away from everybody else. I'll sit 
in there so if there's anything you don't understand you can ask. 
(CONTINUED) 
30 CONTINUED: 30 Michael's eyes go to the page in front of him. He rubs his hands on his knees and stares. Mrs. Boswell waits a beat then scoots her chair over next to him. 
MRS. BOSWELL (CONT'D) Mike, how about I ask the questions and you tell me the answers or as much as you know. She looks at his hands - huge next to hers - then reads: 
52 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - COLLINS' BEDROOM - DAY 52 
Leigh Anne enters Collins' bedroom. Very "teenage girl" but a mess - clothes everywhere. Leigh Anne opens the curtains throwing light into the room. 
LEIGH ANNE Up and at 'em. Collins groans. Leigh Anne picks up a few pieces of clothes. on her way out and groans at the mess. We stay with her as she re-enters the hallway, walks and opens the door to -- 
53 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - SJ'S BEDROOM - DAY 53 
Just as messy but not all clothes. Leigh Anne almost trips on a series of wires connecting games to a large screen TV. 
LEIGH ANNE Sean Junior! She opens the shades. 
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D) Clean this place up before you come downstairs. You hear me? Si crawls out of bed and Leigh Anne exits the room and starts down the stairs, almost afraid of what she'll find. 
54 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 54 
Leigh Anne stops, stares -- The couch is totally back to normal and the sheets, blankets and pillows are neatly stacked in almost military precision. No sign of Michael. 
LEIGH ANNE Mike? Big Mike?! Nothing. She hears a DOG BARKING in the neighborhood and moves to the window to look out. 
55 EXT. TUOHY HOUSE - DAY 55 
Michael, plastic sack in hand, walks away. Leigh Anne exits the front door, spots Michael and tries to catch up. 
LEIGH ANNE Big Mike! 
(CONTINUED) 
The Blind Side - Yellow Draft -- 04/15/09 29 
55 CONTINUED: 55 He stops, turns. Leigh Anne walks over. 
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D) Where are you going? 
MICHAEL Iono. 
LEIGH ANNE Are you spending Thanksgiving with your family? Michael shakes his head. 
56 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - KITCHEN -- DAY (LATER) 56 
Leigh. Anne carves turkey onto a tray and takes it into... 
57 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM -- DAY 57 
Leigh Anne sets the turkey on a serving table alongside the rest of the Tuohy Thanksgiving feast. 
LEIGH ANNE Come and get it! Sean sits at the TV,"watching an Ole Miss football game, while SJ plays.video games on another. Collins chats on her cell. Michael sits off to the side, taking it all in. 
SEAN SJ, Ole Miss is about to score! 
SI Which means they're about to fumble. They all shuffle over, grab plates, start piling on food. Sean loads his plate and heads back to the couch. 
SEAN Looks great, hon. Collins plate is pretty delicately apportioned. 
COLLINS I see a lot of starch. SJ jams turkey into a roll and lathers on cranberry sauce - creating an easy to eat sandwich. He walks away. 
(CONTINUED) 
57 CONTINUED: 57 Michael stares - he's never seen so much food. Leigh Anne hands him a plate. He gingerly puts a slice of.turkey on it. 
LEIGH ANNE As much as you want. 
(WALKS AWAY) Oh, the potato salad! With no one watching him, Michael shoves two rolls into his pants pocket and finishes filling his plate. Leigh Anne reenters to see Michael sitting at the dining room table, alone, not touching his plate. Her eyes go to the rest of her family, shoving down food and playing games. She makes a decision, grabs the remote and turns off the TVs. 
58 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY 58 
The entire family sits at the table. Rockwell would be proud. 
SI Why are we eating in here? Leigh Anne holds out her hands. 
LEIGH ANNE Shall we say grace? The Tuohy family plus Michael hold hands. Collins stares at her tiny hand intertwined with Michael's. As Leigh Anne prays Michael tries to emulate behavior without closing his eyes, taking it all in... 
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D) Heavenly Father. We thank you for all your many blessings on this family. We thank you for bringing us a new friend. And we ask that you look after. us in this holiday season and never let us forget just how very fortunate we are. Amen. A chorus of Amens and they all dig in. Michael is unsure at first how to correctly use the silverware. He picks up the fork and Leigh Anne nods, "that's right". She eyes Michael's stained shirt. 
(CONTINUED) 
58 CONTINUED: 58 
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D) Big Mike, do you like to shop? (off his look) Because tomorrow I think I'm gonna have to show you how it's done. 
59 INT. LEIGH ANNE'S CAR -- DAY 59 
Leigh Anne drives and Michael sits shotgun. 
MICHAEL I qot clothes. 
LEIGH ANNE You "have" clothes.. And an extra T- shirt in a plastic bag does not a wardrobe make. He looks out the window. 
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D) Okay, fine, let's go get 'em. Just tell me where I'm going. No answer. Frustrated, she pulls the car over to the curb and puts it in park. 
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D) Tell me everything I need to know about you. He still stares out the window. 
(CONTINUED) 
65 CONTINUED: 65 
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D) And before you choose something think about yourself wearing it and ask yourself: Is this me? 
She finds one shirt, holds it out. 
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D) 
What about this? 
He shakes his head, "no". 
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D) 
(ANOTHER SHIRT) This isn't atrocious. 
SHE He shakes his head again. After a beat he points. almost laughs. 
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D) This one? This is the one you like? He nods, completely sure. 
66 EXT. WINGATE - DAY 66 
Drop off area. Leigh Anne's car pulls up and SJ, Collins and Michael get out. 
LEIGH ANNE Have a great day. Learn something! They say a few good-byes, get out and walk toward the arch. Only then do we see what Michael is wearing: a GARGANTUAN 
ORANGE AND MAROON STRIPED RUGBY SHIRT. Leigh Anne shakes her head, watching him walk away. A car behind her HONKS. She checks the rear view mirror -- 
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D) Don't get your panties in a wad. 
67 INT. TONY RESTAURANT - DAY 67 
Ladies who lunch. The right sort doing their thing. Leigh Anne sits at a table with three friends, BETH, ELAINE and SHERRY. They sip on lemon water and nibble at salads. 
BETH The best part about Paris was the food.

The Blind Side - Yellow Draft -- 04/15/09 36 
67 CONTINUED: 67 
BETH (CONT'D) They use sauce like we use gravy. I had to join a gym the day'we got back. 
LEIGH ANNE Any of y'all spent much time on the other side of town? 
ELAINE On the freeway. 
SHERRY Where exactly are you talking about? 
LEIGH ANNE Alabama Street... Hurt Village. 
BETH Hurt Village -- that sounds like a threat. 
LEIGH ANNE You're not far off. 
SHERRY It would "hurt" me to go there. 
ELAINE It would certainly hurt your reputation to go there. 
BETH (tongue in cheek) I'm actually from there but didn't mind hard work and look where I am now. 
LEIGH ANNE Eating an eighteen dollar salad. 
BETH And it's a little soggy to be honest. 
SHERRY Such a shame. 
BETH (re: her salad) Yes it is. 
(CONTINUED) 
67 CONTINUED: 67 
SHERRY Civil rights was responsible for some good things but those programs - building ugly, low cost housing. I mean how could you be creative if you lived there? It's stifling. 
ELAINE Did you know that black men were employed at a higher rate before those programs? It's a fact. 
BETH They're not "black", Elaine. The term du jour is African-American. 
ELAINE And what if they're from Jamaica, or like Bermuda. 
SHERRY Then they're BerMUDian-Americans. They all cringe and laugh. 
ELAINE So, why are you asking about the projects, Leigh.Anne? Another one of your charities? 
BETH A project for the projects. That's catchy. Money would raise itself. (off their laughs) Don't laugh. Count me in, Leigh Anne. And they laugh harder. Leigh Anne smiles, biting her lip. 
71 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - MICHAEL'S BEDROOM - DAY 71 
Now turned into Michael's room, with an armoire, a chest of drawers, night stands, the whole nine yards. The bed is a massive futon in an ornate stand. Leigh Anne and Michael stand in the doorway. 
LEIGH ANNE I had to put half my samples in storage but well, anyway, back there's a desk. (points as she talks) Chest o'drawers. Night stand. Lamps. Alarm clock. Bed. Sean says a lot of pro athletes use futons if they can't find a big enough bed. Michael doesn't dare touch anything, just stares in awe. 
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D) Well, try it out. See if it feels okay. He gingerly moves to the bed; touches it. 
(CONTINUED) 
71 CONTINUED: 71 
MICHAEL It's mine? 
LEIGH ANNE Yeah. (off his look) What? 
MICHAEL Never had one before. 
LEIGH ANNE 
(CONFUSED) A room to yourself? 
MICHAEL A bed. We can see this unsettles her. She turns away a bit, trying to contain herself. 
LEIGH ANNE Well, you got one now. 
72 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY 72 
She leaves the room, walks down the hall and enters --

Michael, in another rugby shirt, this one BLACK AND YELLOW, carries a tray and sits with SJ, who starts laughing. 
MICHAEL What? 
SJ Enough with the rugby shirts. You look like a giant bumble bee. Collins walks by with friends and glances but ignores them. 
GIRL STUDENT Who's the big guy hanging around with your little brother? 
COLLINS Just another one of Mom's projects. 
GIRL STUDENT That must get incredibly old. Collins' look says, "yes it does."

SI That Taco Bell. The KFC catty corner. The Long John Silvers on the next block. 
MICHAEL You own all of 'ern? 
SJ Yeah. We've got hundreds. 
BETH Does Michael get the family discount at Taco Bell? Because if he does Sean's gonna lose a few stores. More laughter. 
LEIGH ANNE Look, he's a great kid. 
ELAINE I say just make it official and adopt him. Big laughs at the "crazy" idea. 
LEIGH ANNE He'll be eighteen in a few months. (off their confusion) So, I mean it wouldn't make much sense to legally adopt him, right? They realize she's thought about it and stop laughing. After an awkward beat of silence... 
SHERRY Is this some kind of white guilt thing, Leigh Anne? I mean charity's the Lord's work but... 
ELAINE What will your daddy say? 
LEIGH ANNE Before or after he turns over in his grave? Daddy's gone five years now, Elaine, and to make matters worse you were at the funeral. You wore Chanel with that awful black hat. Before Elaine can attack -- 
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D) Look, here's the deal. I don't need any of y'all to approve of my choices. But I do ask you to respect them. You have no idea what this boy's been through. 
(MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
91, CONTINUED: 91 
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D) And if this is going to be a running diatribe I can find an overpriced salad a lot closer to home. 
SHERRY I'm so sorry, Leigh Anne. We didn't intend to -- 
ELAINE No, we didn't, really -- 
BETH I mean, what you're doing is so great. To open your home to him. You're changing his life. Leigh Anne smiles to herself, realizing... 
LEIGH ANNE No. He's changing mine. 
ELAINE That's awesome for you, but... what about Collins? 
LEIGH ANNE What about Collins? 
ELAINE Aren't you worried, even just a little? (off Leigh Anne) I mean he is a boy, a large, black boy, sleeping under the same roof. Leigh Anne stares at them, shakes her head then grabs the 
CHECK --- 
LEIGH ANNE I've got this. (rises; to the group) Shame on you. And strides away. 
92 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - COLLINS' ROOM - NIGHT 92

(CONTINUED) 
92 CONTINUED: 
LEIGH ANNE Be honest with me now, okay? Collins nods, having no idea what her mother is about to say. 
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D) Is Michael being here weird for you? 
COLLINS They're stupid kids, who cares what they say. 
LEIGH ANNE What kids? 
COLLINS At school. They're juvenile. 
LEIGH ANNE And what do the juvenile kids say? 
COLLINS It's really not worth repeating. And don't worry about SJ - he loves the attention. He introduces Michael as his big brother. 
LEIGH ANNE What about you? 
COLLINS It's fine. (off Leigh Anne's look) I mean, you can't just throw him out on the street. 
LEIGH ANNE I can make other arrangements. (off Collins' hesitance) Just let me know. Okay?... Leigh Anne kisses Collins goodnight. 
93 EXT. WINGATE - PLAYGROUND - DAY

NEARBY Collins watches. 
94 INT. WINGATE - LIBRARY - DAY 94 
Collins is sitting with her friends, laughing and whispering. She notices Michael enter and walk to a table with a book. He sits alone while every other table is full. Collins sighs, makes up her mind and stands with her books. 
FRIEND Where are you going? Collins walks away toward Michael. 
FRIEND (CONT'D) Collins? They are aghast when they see Collins set down her books across from Michael and sit.

100 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - LEIGH ANNE'S WORKSPACE - NIGHT 100 
Leigh Anne goes through sample boxes and matches swatches. 
MICHAEL Mrs. Tuohy? Michael stands nearby. 
LEIGH ANNE I hear "Mrs. Tuohy" I look over my shoulder for my mother--in-law. Call me Leigh Anne or Mama or almost anything else. 
MICHAEL Will you help get me something? 
LEIGH ANNE What? 
MICHAEL Driver's license. 
LEIGH ANNE Why do you need a driver's license when you don't have a car? 
MICHAEL You have a car. 
(CONTINUED) 
100 CONTINUED: 
LEIGH ANNE That I use to haul y'all all over creation with. He doesn't say anything but doesn't leave either. Leigh Anne puts down the swatches, turns to him.. 
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D) Why do you want a license, Michael? 
MICHAEL Something to carry. With my name on it. She locks eyes with him. This time he holds her gaze. 
DMV EMPLOYEE (V.0.) Address?... 
101 INT. DMV OFFICE - DAY 101 
Leigh Anne and Michael sit across from a DMV EMPLOYEE typing on her computer. Leigh Anne holds out her driver's license. 
DMV EMPLOYEE Is this his address as well? 
LEIGH ANNE Yes. He lives with us. 
DMV EMPLOYEE Are y'all his foster parents? 
LEIGH ANNE No. 
DMV EMPLOYEE His legal guardians? 
LEIGH ANNE oh... no. The Employee does a search on the computer. As she types... 
DMV EMPLOYEE Does he have a Social Security card? Leigh Anne looks to Michael, who shakes his head. 
DMV EMPLOYEE (CONT'D) Birth certificate? 
(CONTINUED) 
101 CONTINUED: 101 
LEIGH ANNE We tried to find one for school, but... 
DMV.EMPLOYEE You don't know which city, which county, which hospital?... 
LEIGH ANNE How big a problem is this? DMV Employee looks to Leigh Anne. 
DMV EMPLOYEE There's nobody named Michael Oher in the system. Another last name perhaps? Leigh Anne again turns to Michael, who shrugs. 
LEIGH ANNE Look, I'll sign something saying he lives with us and we'll pay for the insurance; whatever it takes. (off her look) What's it gonna take? Off the Employee's look -- 
102 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - SEAN AND LEIGH ANNE'S MASTER BATH - NIGHT 102 
As they get ready for bed. Sean rinses his mouth -- 
SEAN You wanna do what?! 
LEIGH ANNE Don't pretend you didn't hear me. 
SEAN Shouldn't we at least talk about it? 
LEIGH ANNE What do you think we're doing? And don't act like I'm going behind your back. I know you put us down as his medical contact at school. 
(CONTINUED) 
102 CONTINUED: 102 
SEAN There's a big difference between paying for a broken arm and being legally responsible for someone. Someone we barely know. 
104 CONTINUED: 104 
LEIGH ANNE How many children does she have? 
RONALD At least a dozen, probably more. With her drug arrest record my guess would be she can't even remember. Leigh Anne absorbs this. 
LEIGH ANNE We'd need her permission though, .right? 
RONALD No. Michael is a ward of the state. Just apply and get a Judge to sign off on it. 
LEIGH ANNE So you would give him away without even telling his mother? Ronald shrugs. 
105 EXT. HURT VILLAGE - DAY 105 
Looks the same as before except for the'blonde woman walking between the buildings. Leigh Anne spots and checks a list of tenants posted. She can barely see through the cover as someone has scrawled "C Block" on it. 
106 EXT. HURT VILLAGE - DAY 106 
The one Michael visited before. Leigh Anne summons her courage and knocks on the door. And again. No answer. A VOICE comes from the apartment behind her -- 
MAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Who you lookin' for?! Startled, Leigh Anne turns and sees Alton approaching... 
LEIGH ANNE I'm looking for Denise Oher. 
ALTON Dee Dee don't stay there no more. 
(CONTINUED) 
106 CONTINUED: 106 
LEIGH ANNE Do you know where she might be?

LEIGH ANNE No, I can't, but thank you.

DENISE OHER Awhile back. This is temporary. Friends let me stay here.

114 INT. WINGATE - BOB'S LITERATURE CLASS - DAY 114 
Students seated, including Michael, listen to Bob, who stands at the front of the classroom. 
BOB You are now seniors. Congratulations. But with that distinction comes responsibility. This will be one of your tougher courses because my job is to prepare you, at least most of you, for the rigors of college Freshman English. You are each holding a class study guide which details assignments. I won't remind you what is due and when. Read the materials and come prepared. At the end of the year you will each choose one of our literature assignments and present a written dissection of the piece. The faces in the classroom tell us this is a tough course. 
115 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY 115 
Dozens of.condiment jars and bottles are lined up on the table. SJ has the football playbook open and is explaining formations to Michael. 
SI See, you're the ketchup, here at Left Tackle. On the weakside. 
MICHAEL I'm not that weak, SJ. 
SI it just means there are more blockers on the other side. It's a compliment, really. 
MICHAEL A compliment for a condiment. 
SJ 
(CHUCKLES) Good one. (back to work) So the first play is simple. "Gap." It just means you block whoever is in front of you, or the person on your inside shoulder if you're not covered by a defender. (points to condiments) I'll be the running back and you show me what you're supposed to do. Ready... . Hike! SJ, using both hands, moves Cayenne pepper back a bit, then "hands off" to Cinnamon who "runs" toward Michael (Ketchup). Michael moves the bottle forward, pushing back Mustard, then Relish, as well as toppling a bottle of Vanilla Extract. 
SJ (CONT'D) Open lane to the end zone. All there is to it. Si slides Cinnamon forward. The bottle flies off the end of the table and crashes on the ground just as -- Leigh Anne walks down the stairs, purse in hand -- 
LEIGH ANNE What is going on here?!

119 EXT. INTERSECTION - DAY 119 
A massive traffic jam. Leigh Anne pulls her car right onto the median, gets out and starts running. She passes stopped cars and weaves past bystanders on her way to: 
THE COLLISION INTERSECTION As she approaches she sees -- Michael's truck -- the front end is smashed -- The Van - its side caved in -- And -- Michael sitting on the curb, crying. She races over -- 
LEIGH ANNE Michael! He looks up, sobbing. 
MICHAEL I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry! 
LEIGH ANNE Where's SJ?! 
MICHAEL 
LEIGH ANNE I suppose they can be on the team, too. Are you going to protect the family, Michael? 
He nods. She nods back and walks away, past Bert Cotton. 
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D) Yelling at him won't help. He doesn't trust men. In his experience they pretend to care about you 'til they disappear. Cotton chuckles.. She walks over and sits next to SJ, who has the video camera in his lap. 
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D) You're gonna wanna get this. 
INTERCUT VIDEO AND LIVE ACTION: At the snap Michael drives the defender into the dirt. Michael drops back, knocks down one defender, then takes on another while Tony completes a pass. On a sweep to his side, Michael pushes three defenders away, clearing an alley for Bobby to blast through. 
Bert shakes his head, turns to Leigh Anne -- 
COTTON What'd you say to him?

122 INT. WINGATE - LOCKER ROOM -- NIGHT 
Coach Cotton is addressing his team before the game. 
COTTON On the schedule it says this is a home game but don't be deceived, gentlemen. Three fourths of the people in the stands are here from Milford. They'll be loud and rowdy and a lot of 'em drunk. Keep your helmets on 'til you're on the sidelines. I don't want anyone getting beaned with a whiskey bottle. 
(BEAT) Grab a knee. And the team huddles for their prayer... 
(CONTINUED) 
122 CONTINUED: 
COTTON (CONT'D) For we can... (team repeats each phrase) Do all things... Through Jesus Christ... Who strengthens us... Each and every day... 
And may God... Bless the Crusaders! As they rise to leave-- 
COTTON (CONT'D) Oh, one more thing. The reason Milford traveled all that way to come here is they expect to whup your ass. Whup your ass and have a party in your house. Whup your ass, have a party in your house and piss on your mama's new couch. Is that gonna happen? The team erupts with a chorus of NO'.s and HELL NO!s. 
123 EXT. WINGATE - EDGE OF STANDS - NIGHT 123 
As the Wingate Crusaders exit the dressing room they find themselves next to the Milford Lions ready to take the field. The cocky Milford players eye the Crusaders. 
MILFORD PLAYER 
Hey, Crusaders, y'all gonna turn the other cheek or just bend over?! Another Milford player, #66, spots Michael. 
MILFORD #66 Would y'all look at the size of that buck! 
Milford takes the field. Jay Collis, to Michael... 
JAY COLLIS Pay 'em back on the field. Coach Cotton raises a hand and the team moves forward to squeeze through an entrance onto the field. Above them Milford fans look down and jeer, toss sodas at them.

MILFORD DAD (CONT'D) There's the Lions and here come the Christians! SJ turns and gives a dirty look -- 
LEIGH ANNE SJ, eyes forward! Sticks and stones... 
ON THE FIELD 
The ball is kicked off and Bobby, the Crusaders tailback takes it in at the five yard line. He makes one player miss then is dragged down by a swarm of defenders at the twenty. 
COTTON Let's go 0! The offense runs onto the field and huddles. The Milford defense waits, slapping each other and building to a frenzy. Number 66 from before is the defensive end on Michael's side. Wingate breaks huddle and #66 sees him. 
TONY Coach called a pass. 
MICHAEL Gap. 
AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE As Wingate lines up, 66 is at it again. 
MILFORD #66 Your coach always do your fightin' for you? He your Massa?- Michael gets in his stance and on the snap of the ball powers forward. We've never seen him so quick, neither has 66 who dips a hip to keep from being plowed over. The ploy rights 66 but the damage isn't over as Michael now has him "in the fit" grabbing his jersey, "between the tits." -- Bobby races through the hole and into the secondary -- Michael keeps pushing 66 back, picking up speed until 66 is airborne save every third step of Michael's when he touches a toe to the ground like a ballerina -- Bobby cuts to the sideline -- Michael is running full speed with 66 now and he keeps going past the sideline-- Past Collins and the rest of the cheerleaders while -- Bobby makes the opposite corner and heads for the end zone ---

Michael turns and walks back to the field. As he passes Collins she gives him a high five. 
COLLINS Way to go big bro! A referee signals touchdown then notices Michael walking back and 66 lying slumped at the fence. The Ref throws a flag. 
COTTON Now what?! Was he holding? 
REFEREE Uh, no. 
COTTON Did he hit after the whistle? 
REFEREE I don't believe so. 
COTTON Then what's the flag for? 
REFEREE I dunno... . Excessive blocking. 
COTTON You're kidding me. The Referee ignores and returns to the field to assess the penalty. 66, now on his feet, limps back onto the field. Michael looks at him and 66's eyes go straight to the dirt. Cotton walks up to Michael. 
MICHAEL Sorry, Coach. I stopped when I heard the whistle. 
(CONTINUED) 
124 CONTINUED: 
COTTON Where were you taking him, Mike? 
MICHAEL To the bus. It was time for him to go home. Cotton smiles proudly and slaps Michael on the ass. 
COTTON Attaboy, Michael Oher. Attaboy! 
IN THE STANDS 
Leigh Anne stands and turns to face the Milford fans 
LEIGH ANNE See number seventy-four? Well, that's MY son.! The Milford fans don't know what to make of this. Leigh Anne sits down with a self-satisfied smile.

Touchdown! --- And another touchdown -- Scoreboard reads: VISITORS 7 HOME 35 66 limps off the field, shamed and another player takes his place. The SCRUB, terrified, looks to Michael. AT THE SNAP the Scrub flinches and hits the dirt. The play goes to the other side and Michael reaches a hand down to help the Scrub up and to his feet.

TOM LEMMING Does he really think getting it one day early is gonna give LSU a leg up? An ASSISTANT hurries up. 
ASSISTANT Have you filled all the slots for the Army All Star Game? 
TOM LEMMING Yeah, why? The assistant hands over the distinctive DVD marked MICHAEL 
OHER - THE TERMINATOR! 
ASSISTANT You might want to open one up. 
127 EXT. SEAN'S OFFICE - DAY 127 
Lemming walks along with Sean and Coach Cotton toward Sean's 
office. 
TOM LEMMING Every year there are a dozen running backs in the high school ranks who will make it to the NFL. Quarterbacks maybe three or four. But left tackles, true left tackles, they're freaks, gifts from the gods. A great one only comes around every four or five years. Mike's the best I've seen in ten.

Leigh Anne arrives to see a group of coaches, all wearing shirts and hats emblazoned with school logos. They chat and watch as the Wingate football team finishes calisthenics. One ASSISTANT COACH, from. Southern Miss, sees Fulmer racing up. 
SOUTHERN MISS COACH Shoot, man, Fulmer's here. I might as well go home. Fulmer smiles at the assembled coaches, shakes a few-hands. 
FULMER Drove all the way from Knoxville to come see for myself. Leigh Anne slides in near the group so she can eavesdro 
CLEMSON ASSISTANT COACH Heck, I drove from Clemson, that's nine hours! Bert cotton walks over, shakes Fulmer's hand, leaving the other coaches shaking their heads. 
COTTON Coach Fulmer, it's a real honor. 
FULMER Coach Cotton I been keeping an eye on your program. Y'all doing a fine job down here. Wouldn't be a bit surprised to see you coaching at the next level real soon. Cotton's smile tells us he'd like that a lot. 
FULMER (CONT`D) Is that him? Is that O'Hair? 
LEIGH ANNE It's Oher. Like a paddle in a boat. Fulmer notices Leigh Anne, grunts then turns back to Cotton. 
(CONTINUED) 
139 CONTINUED: 139 
FULMER If you could run him through a few drills, we'd sure appreciate it.. .Cotton gives Leigh Anne a look that says, "get out of here." She shakes her head -- "I'm not going anywhere." Cotton blows his whistle and the team approaches. 
COTTON 
Board drill. Big Mike and Jay 
Collis. Best on best. An Equipment manager lays out a plank and Jay Collis sighs and lines up, one foot on either side of the board. Michael slowly moves into position opposite him. The coaches all inch closer and crane their necks to see. Leigh Anne is now right in the middle of them. Fulmer gives her a look that says,,"Who the hell are you?" Cotton blows his whistle, Michael fires out and it's over in 
an instant. Collis is pancaked under Michael, who gets up and offers a hand. The coaches are frozen - as if they've witnessed a miracle. 
FULMER (almost to himself) Force equals mass times acceleration. Then, all at once, the coaches pull out their cell phones and start poking digits and jabbering: "You won't believe it!" "You gotta see this!" "He's a freak of nature!" The Clemson coach strides away. 
COTTON Where are you going, Coach? 
CLEMSON COACH Back to South Carolina. I've seen more than enough. If he can qualify with his grades you tell Michael Oher that Clemson wants him. 
FULMER Good luck with that, Brad! Fulmer smiles wide then turns to look once more at Michael.

Leigh Anne, distressed, has books and pamphlets spread out in front of her. Sean walks in, takes in the sight. 
LEIGH ANNE Did you know that to be eligible for a Division One scholarship Michael's gonna need a 2.5 GPA? 
SEAN Really? 
LEIGH ANNE His ACT is low and I don't see him doing any better if he retakes it. 
SEAN What's his GPA now? 
LEIGH ANNE 
SEAN Not bad really, when you consider where he started. 
LEIGH ANNE He needs to make A's this year. (off Sean's laugh) I'm serious. And that might not even be enough. 
SEAN So he goes to Junior College. 
LEIGH ANNE Most inner city kids that go to JC drop out in a year. His shot at the pros would go out the window. 
SEAN Pros? Are we even sure he's gonna get college offers? She walks over to the answering machine, presses "Play."

SI Can I ask a question? 
SABAN Sure. 
SJ My brother and me are very close. I'm worried that if he goes off to school I won't see him so... 
SABAN Go on. 
SI I guess I was just wondering how much access I'd have to him. Saban smiles at the kid's moxie. 
SABAN Tell you what, SJ. Michael comes to LSU I'll get you an all-access pass. How's that sound?

MISS SUE It's a poem. 
SEAN "Forward the Light Brigade!" That's like the offense. "Charge for the guns'he said." That's the end zone. "Into the Valley of Death rode the six hundred." He knows it by heart and even miss Sue is impressed.

COLLINS 
(ON PHONE) Michael, please call me and let me know you're okay. 
LEIGH ANNE Text him SJ. 
SEAN Keep it light. Tell him you're gonna take his truck for a spin if he doesn't get in touch. SJ starts texting. Leigh Anne and Sean stare at each other. 
A191 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - SEAN AND'LEIGH ANNE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT A191 
(LATER) Sean sits in bed and Leigh Anne paces. 
LEIGH ANNE I should have followed him. 
SEAN You had no way of knowing he'd disappear. 
LEIGH ANNE Was he right? (off Sean's look) What he said about us? 
SEAN Leigh Anne, be sensible. We gave clothes to a boy who had one pair of shorts. We gave him a bed. To hell with the NCAA, I'd do it again tomorrow. 
(CONTINUED) 
A191 CONTINUED: A191 
LEIGH ANNE What about the rest of it - all the stuff we did to make sure he got a scholarship? A scholarship to Ole Miss. 
SEAN He could go wherever he wanted, he knew that. 
LEIGH ANNE Did he? Did you ask him? 'Cause I know for sure I never did. Sean considers this, then beckons. 
SEAN Come here, honey. She moves to him. He puts his arm around her, kisses her forehead. 
LEIGH ANNE Am I a good person? (off his look) Not a joke. Not rhetorical. 
SEAN You're the best person I know. Everything you do, you do for others. 
LEIGH ANNE Why is that? 
SEAN (with a smile) I have not a clue. You obviously get some sick satisfaction from it. She looks at him. There's truth in his words. 
LEIGH ANNE Sean... what if he never comes back? 
191 EXT. HURT VILLAGE - NIGHT 191 
Michael makes his way toward Building "C", passing some of the same faces we've seen before. 
(CONTINUED) 
191 CONTINUED: 191 Alton opens his door to make a transaction with an addict'and spots Michael. 
ALTON That you Big Mike? Get your ass in here. 
MICHAEL I'm looking for Moms. 
ALTON Your Mama? Oh, I seen Dee Dee around. She usually stop by for a taste around this time. Tell you what, I'll get you a forty and we'll chop it up 'til she get here. Michael hesitates. Alton smiles, beckons. 
192 OMITTED 192 
193 INT. HURT VILLAGE - ALTON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 193 
Shitty but with good electronics. There are maybe eight people in the apartment - partying, drinking, getting high. Michael steps inside. Alton points to a chair. A stoned out couple smokes on the adjacent couch. Next to them an INFANT cries in a broken down crib. In the other corner of the room sits David, the young man we met before. Michael nods and David nods back. Alton hands Michael a beer. 
ALTON It's good to see you, Big Mike. You lookin' fit. I heard you playin' some ball. 
MICHAEL Yeah. 
ALTON But you know that rich kid football ain't like the public school league. People packing knives in their socks. Back in the day I was a quarterback. You knew that, right? At MLK. 
(CONTINUED) 
193 CONTINUED: 193 
MICHAEL Yeah, I heard. 
(TO DAVID) You still playing ball over at the 
JC? 
DAVID Naw. 
202 EXT. CURB - DAY 202 
Leigh Anne sits on the curb with Michael. 
LEIGH ANNE I'd imagine the last thing anybody at Hurt Village wants is cops snooping around. (after a beat) I swore I'd never ask but... how'd you make it out of there, Michael? 
MICHAEL When I was little and something awful was happening, my Mama would tell me to close my eyes. 
(MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
202 CONTINUED: 202 
MICHAEL (CONT'D) She was tryin' to keep me from seeing her do drugs or other bad things. And she'd say, "keep 'em closed till I say so." And then when she was finished or the bad things were over she'd say, "now when I count to three, you open your eyes and the past is gone, the world is a good place, and it's all gonna be okay." 
LEIGH ANNE You closed your eyes. He nods. She shakes her head, amazed at the kid. They stare out at the street, then... 
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D) You know, when I was driving all over Kingdom Come looking for you I just kept thinking about one thing. 
(BEAT) Ferdinand the bull. Everyone assumed because he was big that he wanted to fight in the ring. But he just wanted to sit under a tree and smell the flowers. (right at him) I know I should have asked this a long time ago but do you even wanna play football? I mean, do you even like it?' Michael considers this. 
MICHAEL I'm pretty good at it. 
LEIGH ANNE Yeah, you are. 
(A BEAT) Sean and I have been talking and Michael, if you're gonna accept a football scholarship we think it should be from Tennessee. (off his look) And I promise you I will be at every game cheering for you. 
MICHAEL Every game? 
(CONTINUED) 
202 CONTINUED: 202 
LEIGH ANNE But I will not wear that gaudy orange of theirs because it's not in my color wheel. 
MICHAEL You want me to go to Tennessee? 
LEIGH ANNE I want you to go wherever you want. It's your decision, Michael. It's your life. 
MICHAEL What if I wanted to flip burgers? She takes this in, swallows hard and 
LEIGH ANNE Your decision; your life. Michael smiles. 
MICHAEL Okay. 
LEIGH ANNE Okay, what? 
203 INT. NONDESCRIPT GOVERNMENT-LOOKING ROOM - DAY 203 
Michael is at another session with Jocelyn Granger. 
MICHAEL I'm sorry I left the other day. 
GRANGER You were pretty upset. 
MICHAEL You ask a lot of questions. 
GRANGER I'm trying to get to the bottom of this. 
MICHAEL But all the questions you asked were about why everybody else wanted me to go to Ole Miss. 
(CONTINUED) 
203 CONTINUED: 203 
GRANGER Okay... 
MICHAEL You asked about everybody but me. You never asked why I wanted to go there. 
GRANGER Alright, fine, Michael... why do you want to go to Ole Miss? 
MICHAEL It's where my family goes to school. It's where they've always gone to school. Granger considers this, stares at Michael, then almost, just almost, smiles. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
204 EXT. OLE MISS DORM - DAY 204 
Cars are unloaded as parents and siblings move their kids into the dorm. Tearful good-byes and lots of picture taking. Leigh Anne and.Sean walk from the dorm toward the car, giving last words of advice. SJ and.Collins are there, too. 
LEIGH ANNE College is going to be a different experience for you. There are lots of distractions. 
SEAN Just have fun. 
LEIGH ANNE There'll always be some nimrod in the dorm who wants to play video games all night, or goof off on the internet. 
SEAN You're gonna have a great time. I know I did. Leigh Anne gives Sean a look - "You're not helping."

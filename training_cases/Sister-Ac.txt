SISTER ACT 
FADE IN: 
INT. ST. ANNE'S ACADEMY - AKRON, OHIO - CLASSROOM We are in a parochial school classroom, in the late Sixties.  The children all wear uniforms and sit at little desks.  SISTER IMMACULATA stands at the front of the room; she is a middle-aged nun, very severe.  The children are all terrified of her. 
SISTER IMMACULATA Who can name all the Apostles?  Yes? 
ANGLE ON CHRISTINE CARTER 
A thirteen-year-old girl sitting at a desk.  She raises her hand. 
SISTER IMMACULATA Christine? 
CHRISTINE Sister, may I be excused? 
SISTER IMMACULATA Christine... 
CHRISTINE It's an emergency.  Real bad. 
Sister Immaculata nods, pursing her lips.  Christine stands and heads for the door. 
CUT TO: 
INT. GIRLS ROOM 
Christine is now in the deserted St. Anne's girls room. She is standing on tiptoes, looking in the mirror.  She has taken her hair out of its neat barrettes; she is combing it out.  She applies lipstick. 
Christine reaches into her schoolbag; she pulls out a stack of glittery bracelets and slips them on.  She unbuttons the top few buttons of her stiff white blouse. She sprays herself with dime store cologne. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. HALLWAY 
Christine opens the girls' room door; she looks both ways. No one is around; she saunters down the hall. 
Page 2. 
ANGLE ON A DOOR MARKED BROOM CLOSET Christine opens this door.  She looks into the closet. There is a very nervous thirteen-year-old BOY waiting for her inside. 
CHRISTINE Hi, Jimmy. 
Christine slips inside the closet and closes the door behind her. 
ANGLE ON SISTER IMMACULATA 
Striding down the hall, with a bloodthirsty look in her eye, and a nasty-looking wooden ruler in her hand.  She flings open the broom closet door, 
ANGLE ON CHRISTINE AND JIMMY 
in the broom closet.  Jimmy's face is covered with lipstick.  Christine's hair is awry.  The couple has clearly been making out. 
SISTER IMMACULATA (outraged) Miss Christine Carter!  Again!  Don't you know what happens to girls like you? Don't you know what they become? 
INT. CHRISTY'S APARTMENT - ANGLE ON A LARGE, TATTERED POSTER-NIGHT (TODAY) 
Taped over a crack on a wall.  The poster shows a glittering CHRISTY VAN CARTIER:  singing star of a fifth- rate Vegas lounge.  Christy wears tight spangles and a major wig on the poster.  She has clearly lived up, or down, to all of Sister Immaculata's expectations. 
The CAMERA PANS through the dark bedroom in which the poster hangs; a neon sign flashes outside the window, casting a red and blue haze over the premises.  A dressing room table is cluttered with dozens of bottles of nail polish and makeup, and garish clothing and flashy jewelry are scattered everywhere. 
We hear the movement of BED SPRINGS as someone sits up in the dark. 
CHRISTY'S VOICE Come on, Vince -- hold me a minute. 
VINCE'S VOICE I'd love to. babe -- but I've got to go. It was great.  Like usual. 
CHRISTY'S VOICE It was twenty minutes.  Like usual. 
Page 3. 
VINCE'S VOICE The best. 
VINCE LAROCCA stands at the mirror, adjusting his clothing and checking his hair.  Vince is a powerful, charismatic man who rules an organized crime empire with personal magnetism and threat.  Vince's hold over Christy is obvious, if unfortunate; he can seem expansive and generous one minute, ruthless and dangerous the next. 
VINCE (half to Christy, half to the mirror) You are something else. 
Christy turns on a lamp and lights a cigarette. 
CHRISTY Come on -- stay.  Just a little.  We can talk, I'll get a pizza.  Pizza in bed, we'll have fun.  And you still haven't told me what happened.  What did she say? 
VINCE What did who say? 
CHRISTY Who?  The other woman.  Your wife. 
Vince turns to face Christy, turning on the charm. 
VINCE Christy.  Is there a problem?  With the coat? 
Christy glances around the room; she doesn't move.  She quickly sizes up the situation.  She tries to appear matter-of-fact. unaffected by what she's just seen. 
CHRISTY No... it's fine. 
VINCE Yes? 
CHRISTY Thanks.  A lot. 
VINCE Is that why you came up here, Christy? To thank me? 
CHRISTY Sure. 
VINCE And to say you're sorry.  About this afternoon.  And the things you said. Forgotten.  Completely.  Do you understand?  Forgotten. 
CHRISTY (catching the subtext) Right.  Yeah.  Forgotten. 
Page 13. 
Vince crosses the room, to Christy.  He takes her hands in his, and kisses them. 
VINCE That's my girl.  My girl in mink.  Will you be home?  Soon? 
Christy kisses Vince, quickly. 
CHRISTY Right.  I'll be... at the apartment. Call me.  Thanks.  Again. 
Christy reaches for the doorknob, without looking at the door.  She fumbles a bit.  She finds the door. 
CHRISTY Mink.  Wow. 
Christy walks backwards, out the door.  She turns; she is gone. 
JOEY Vince -- is she... okay? 
VINCE Maybe. (considering this) 
WILLY I mean, won't she talk? She seemed kind of upset. 
VINCE She did. (making a decision) Bring her back.  Now.  For a talk. 
JOEY And if she runs? 
VINCE (icy) Take care of it. 
With guns drawn, Willy and Joey run after Christy. 
INT. RECEPTION AREA 
Christy, clearly terrified, is walking quickly away from Vince's office.  She passes through a glass door which leads to the cubicle area. 
LONG SHOT of the cubicle area, which resembles a darkened maze.  Christy hears Joey approaching; she runs into the cubicle area. 
JOEY Christy?  He only wants to talk to you! 
Page 14. 
ANGLE on Christy, crouched behind a half-wall.  She is clutching the coat. 
WILLY Christy? 
There is a stuffed toy, a "Garfield the Cat," attached to the wall near Christy, with suction cups.  Christy tries to pull the cat's feet off the wall, very quietly. 
JOEY Christy? 
Christy finally just yanks the cat off the wall.  She hurls it as high and as far as she can, to the opposite end of the room. 
ANGLE on the flying stuffed cat. 
Joey sees the blur of the cat; he SHOOTS it, and the cat explodes. 
JOEY Come on, Christy!  There's no place to go! 
Christy steadies herself against a Xerox machine.  She accidentally activates the machine, which lights up and starts HUMMING. 
ANGLE on Willy, as he hears the Xerox machine.  He quickly moves toward the SOUND. 
Willy reaches the Xerox machine; the area is deserted.  He starts moving quickly down the aisle   A chair, the kind on casters, comes rolling out of one of the cubicle doorways; the chair hits Willy and he falls. 
Christy runs out of the cubicle; Willy is on the floor, struggling to get up.  As Christy sprints away, Willy SHOOTS at her.  He misses, but a glass partition SHATTERS. 
Christy runs for an open elevator, but it has been summoned from another floor and the doors are beginning to close. She runs even faster.  A BULLET whistles past her ear and hits the back wall of the elevator.  She reaches for the doors a moment too late, and the elevator is gone. 
Christy scrambles to the door beside the elevator and runs into a stairwell as two more BULLETS bite pieces out of the door. 
INT. STAIRWELL 
Taking the stairs three at a time, Christy is flying, still clutching the mink.  The thugs are gaining on her.  A BULLET hits metal and RICOCHETS off several walls and steps. 
Page 15. 
At the next landing, Christy opens the door and ducks into a corridor. 
INT. CORRIDOR 
EDDIE You'd lose.  You'd die.  All over the sidewalk.  And into the street. 
CHRISTY All right!  I get the picture!  I'll do it!  I'll testify! 
EDDIE (to Tate) Get a stenographer. 
Page 18. 
Tate leaves.  Christy looks to Eddie for a bargain now. 
CHRISTY Okay, here's what I want.  I know about this stuff.  A five-star hotel.  With room service. 
EDDIE Maybe Hawaii. 
CLARKSON Diamond Head. 
CHRISTY Yeah.  And I'll need a new look.  Like a disguise. 
EDDIE Maybe Armani. 
CLARKSON No -- Calvin Klein. 
CHRISTY For sportswear.  And a limo.  And my hair -- up? 
CLARKSON It could work. 
EDDIE Jesus, what do you think this is -- Wheel of Fortune?  Let me spell it out for you.  You have to hide like you don't even exist.  You have to get so far hidden away that you never see sunlight. 
CHRISTY (confused) Okay -- no limo. 
EDDIE No nothing. 
CHRISTY What're you gonna do, put me in a bag and bury me? 
EDDIE I'm gonna put you in the last place on Earth that Vince would ever look for you. 
Eddie smiles.  Christy doesn't like the sound of this at all a 
Page 19. 
INT. STAINED CLASS WINDOW - DAY 
Jesus delivers the Sermon on the Mount in vibrant red, blue and green stained glass.  An ORGAN plays a hymn -- badly.  Notes are missed, skipped over and mutilated. 
PAN DOWN to a procession of nuns who march into a chapel at the ancient St. Katherine's Convent.  The organ isn't getting any better, and we see it is being played by SISTER ALMA, a seventy-year-old nun with arthritis and a hearing aid.  Apparently the hearing aid is malfunctioning, because Sister Alma doesn't seem to realize how badly she's playing. 
As the last nun in the procession enters the chapel, she closes the door behind her.  Across the lobby, the front door opens and Eddie enters with a very reluctant Christy. 
CHRISTY (to Eddie) I hate you.  I totally hate you. 
EDDIE Safest place in the world.  You think Vince would look for you here? 
As Christy looks around the lobby, various religious artifacts loom at her; we see them from her terrified P0V. ANGLE on a crucifix, casting an ominous shadow, a stack of hymnals, and a large, framed Sunday School-style portrait of St. Katherine.  Christy shudders. 
CHRISTY Nuns, Eddie.  There are nuns here. Everywhere.  It's crawling with 'em. 
EDDIE It's a convent.  All you have to do is shut up, behave yourself, and get along. 
CHRISTY With nuns?  With rulers?  No way.  I'm gonna go back, work things out with Vince. 
Christy turns to head back to the entrance, but Eddie catches her arm. 
EDDIE Vince has put out a contract on you.  A hundred grand.  You've seen him in action. 
Christy searches his eyes for a lie, but realizes he's telling the truth. 
CHRISTY But... but Vince loves me.  How could he... I mean, five years... 
Page 20. 
EDDIE And one bullet.  That's all it's gonna take. 
CHRISTY (suddenly scared) But Vince has contacts all over the place!  This is San Francisco!  They'll be looking for me! 
EDDIE Everywhere but this little hole-in-the- wall convent.  Nobody knows you're here but me.  We're trying to get a quick court date.  A month, maybe two, tops. I'll spring you as soon as I can. 
CHRISTY (panicking) I can't stay here!  I'll crack up! Eddie, what am I gonna do? 
EDDIE Pray. (smiling) 
From inside the chapel, the CHOIR begins to sing a hymn -- horribly.  The voices don't blend, and individual notes are real migraine material.  Christy looks aghast.  Eddie urges her into a corridor, and she follows. 
INT. MOTHER SUPERIOR'S OFFICE 
The office is bare and austere.  MOTHER SUPERIOR sits at her desk with her hands folded.  Like all the nuns at the convent, she wears the traditional full-length habit and wimple. 
Mother Superior is in total command of all she surveys, and she seldom raises her voice or her blood pressure as she rules.  Control is her passion; within the walls of the convent, she has created a world she can trust because it's a world she controls. 
But Mother Superior is not in control at this particular moment.  BISHOP GEORGE O'HARA stands before her with a majestic presence and some bad news. 
MOTHER SUPERIOR Absolutely not.  I am very sorry, but no. 
O'HARA We can save this young woman's life, and imprison a parasite -- all in one gesture. 
Page 21. 
MOTHER SUPERIOR Your cigarette -- out. 
Christy inspects her cigarette. 
Page 24. 
MOTHER SUPERIOR (ruefully) It has come to pass. 
CHRISTY What? 
MOTHER SUPERIOR I joined this convent some thirty years ago.  At that time, the world knew some measure of peace.  And hope.  Our order was a beacon of hospitality, to families, to children, to a neighborhood filled with promise.  And, as the years have passed, I have watched that promise destroyed.  Drugs.  Gangs. (staring at Christy's outfit) Spandex.  And. so I have made this convent an oasis, a retreat from horror. And now that horror has invaded these sacred walls. 
CHRISTY Are you talking about me? 
MOTHER SUPERIOR And all those like you. 
CHRISTY You mean black people? 
MOTHER SUPERIOR Absolutely not.  I mean the wicked.  The heedless.  And their Las Vegas concubines. 
CHRISTY (very suspicious) What's a concubine? 
MOTHER SUPERIOR Check your driver's license. 
Christy stands, facing off with Mother Superior. 
CHRISTY Fine.  Got it.  Look, the way I see it, I'm stuck here, right?  I mean, I'm here or I'm target practice.  So here's the deal -- I don't bug you, you don't bug me.  I'll catch up on some sleep, watch some tube, lay back and lay low.  So just get me a key and show me to my room, and do not disturb.  Capisce? 
MOTHER SUPERIOR (suspiciously gracious) Of course.  But it's almost lunch. 
Page 25. 
CHRISTY Cool.  Is there a menu?  Or buffet? 
MOTHER SUPERIOR Before we do, you might like to freshen up.  And you'll certainly want to change 
CHRISTY (sniffing her clothes, the same outfit she's had on since the night at Vince's office) Deal. 
INT. CONVENT CHANGING ROOM 
A small room, with a sewing machine, some bolts of fabric, and several wooden cabinets.  There is a wooden screen in a corner, marking a changing area.  Christy is behind the screen; we hear her, but do not see her,  Mother Superior stands beside the screen, catching the various items of clothing which Christy tosses to her. 
CHRISTY (O.S.) How about a robe?  One of those big terry cloth jobs, with like embroidery on the pocket.  "Guest of St. Katherine's" 
MOTHER SUPERIOR Would you like that? 
Mother Superior takes Christy's skirt and blouse, and tosses them down a chute marked "INCINERATOR." 
CHRISTY (O.S.) You should hand-wash that blouse, and send somebody out for some things.  I look good in reds, purples, hot pink -- and shoes.  Five-inch heels.  Fuck-me pumps.  Oh, man -- sorry.   'Scuse my mouth. 
Mother Superior carries Christy's lacy bra at the end of a ruler; it goes down the incinerator. 
MOTHER SUPERIOR Excused.  Open the cabinet to your left. You will find appropriate attire. 
CHRISTY (O.S.) Can do. 
INT. CHAPEL 
A group of nuns are praying, their heads bowed.  They hear a muffled SCREAM, from elsewhere in the convent. They look up, puzzled. 
Page 26. 
INT. CONVENT CHANGING ROOM 
Christy is standing before a full-length mirror, staring at herself, in complete shock.  She now wears a habit and wimple.  Mother Superior is doing final adjustments on the wimple. 
CHRISTY (almost unable to speak) No!  No!  I can't do this! 
MOTHER SUPERIOR Normally dressed, you are a sore thumb, and you endanger us all.  While you are here, you will conduct yourself as a nun. Only I shall know who, and what, you truly are.  You will not disrupt the convent.  You will not influence the Sisters with your colorful street talk. You will draw no attention to yourself in any way. 
CHRISTY (furious, in disbelief) But look at rites  Look at this!  I'm a nun!  I'm invisible!  I'm a penguin! 
MOTHER SUPERIOR As of now, and until you leave, you are Sister Mary Clarence. 
CHRISTY (outraged) Mary Clarence?  Like a guy?  Like a dumb guy? 
INT. CONVENT HALLWAY - A MINUTE LATER 
Mother Superior is striding down the hall.  Christy is beside her, trying to get the hang of her new outfit. 
MOTHER SUPERIOR The Mary is in deference to the Holy Mother, the Clarence in honor of Saint Clarence Loyola.  There are three vows that every nun must accept.  The vow of poverty... 
CHRISTY (pulling out her pockets) No problem. 
MOTHER SUPERIOR The vow of obedience. 
CHRISTY Like to who? 
Page 27. 
MOTHER SUPERIOR And the vow of chastity. 
CHRISTY I'm outta here. 
Christy starts to leave; Mother Superior grabs her by the wimple 
Larry covers his ears with both hands. 
LARRY I can't hear this.  I'm an attorney, Vince, and you're just an honest casino owner.  Object of a witch hunt. Innocent victim. 
VINCE Keep the message vague, but let 'em know.  The price has gone up.  Christy Van Cartier -- a quarter of a million. Dead or nearby. 
Vince looks grim and vindictive, as he gets into the car. 
EXT. CONVENT VEGETABLE GARDEN - DAY 
The vegetable patch is located behind the convent, on a patch of land surrounded by high walls.  Various sections have been partitioned with string and then furrowed. 
Several nuns are working in the patch, weeding and raking. They wear large, ungainly straw hats over their wimples. 
Christy has been given a hoe and a straw hat.  She is hacking at the dirt, with great disinterest.  She picks up a carrot from the vegetable patch; she looks around to see if anyone is watching.  She starts to gnaw on the carrot. She becomes aware that someone is watching her.  She looks up. 
Sister Mary Robert is watching Christy eat the carrot, breaking her fast.  Christy drops the carrot on the ground, as if it burned her.  Mary Robert resumes hoeing in the next furrow over. 
Christy stares at Mary Robert, narrowing her eyes. Christy looks around; all the other nuns are busy at their tasks.  Christy decides that she will try and make Sister Mary  Robert talk.  She picks up the carrot and tosses it at Mary Robert.  Mary Robert jumps.  She waggles a finger at Christy, scolding her.  Mary Robert resumes hoeing. 
Page 31. 
Christy is now determined.  She takes her hoe, and tiptoes nearer to Mary Robert.  Very gently, she uses the handle of the floe to lift Mary Robert's skirt, and gooses her. 
Mary Robert vips, very loudly.  All the other nuns turn and stare at Mary Robert, scolding her.  Christy waggles her finger at Mary Robert, scolding her. 
Christy, giggling to herself, resumes hoeing.  She sees Mother Superior, standing at the end of the furrow.  Mother Superior looks extremely grim; she has not missed anything. 
EXT. SUNSET - THAT NIGHT 
LONG SHOT of the sun going down, ending the nuns' Vow of Silence. 
We hear Christy SCREAM, O.S. 
INT. CONVENT HALLWAY - THAT NIGHT 
This hallway is marked by a series of heavy wooden doors with tiny, grilled windows.  These are the cells where the nuns sleep.  Nuns are entering their cells and closing their doors for the night. 
Mother Superior glides down the hall, followed by a dusty, bedraggled Christy.  Christy is devouring a slice of brown bread. 
CHRISTY Is this all the food I get? 
MOTHER SUPERIOR Yes.  Until breakfast. 
CHRISTY That's tomorrow!  Don't you have any snacks?  Machines? 
They stop by a door. 
MOTHER SUPERIOR This shall be your cell, Mary Clarence. 
CHRISTY My what? 
MOTHER SUPERIOR Your cell.  Your room. 
INT. CHRISTY'S CELL 
The door swings open, and Mother Superior and Christy enter.  The room is tiny, with bare plaster walls.  There is a narrow wooden bed, with a thin muslin-covered mattress.  There is a small nightstand and a wooden stool. 
Page 32. 
CHRISTY (looking around) You were right the first time.  Is this like, solitary?  The cooler?  Where's the furniture? 
MOTHER SUPERIOR Our lives are simple.  We have little need for material possessions. 
CHRISTY Right, sure thing.  But what about, like, appliances?  Like a little color portable?  Boom box? 
MOTHER SUPERIOR Useless distractions. 
CHRISTY (sinking to the bed) It's like the Stone Age.  The room time forgot.  What about a phone? 
MOTHER SUPERIOR And whom would you call? 
CHRISTY Oh, I don't know... Satan? 
MOTHER SUPERIOR (not amused) Your cell is more than adequate. 
CHRISTY Right.  So what do we do now?  Ping- Pong?  Row over to the monastery? 
MOTHER SUPERIOR It is nine p.m.  Pleasant dreams. 
CHRISTY Wait.  No.  You're kidding.  Lights out? At nine?  My day's just starting. 
MOTHER SUPERIOR I'm sure.  If I were you, I would use this time, to think about my life.  And its direction.  Or lack thereof. 
CHRISTY (indignant) What's wrong with my life? 
MOTHER SUPERIOR From all I've heard, just about everything.  Your singing career seems all but nonexistent, and your married lover wants you dead. (MORE) 
Page 33 
MOTHER SUPERIOR (CONT'D) If you're fooling anyone, it's only yourself.  God has brought you here. Take the hint. 
Mother Superior leaves. 
After the door shuts, Christy stands and looks out the one small window in her cell.  She leans her head against the wall.  She is trying not to think about what Mother Superior has said.  Still, the mess her life has become overwhelms her.  She fights back tears. 
Mary Lazarus leaves the bathing room, and the other nuns resume scrubbing themselves.  Christy looks around. 
CHRISTY Anybody got conditioner? 
INT. CHAPEL - A FEW MINUTES LATER 
Bishop O'Hara is leading the Sunday mass.  He stands in the pulpit.  The choir nuns stand in a fenced-in area to his left.  The remaining nuns, including Christy and Mother Superior, sit in the first few pews. 
O'HARA We are a small congregation this morning.  Too many mornings.  Something has gone terribly wrong.   Where is faith?  Where is celebration?  Where is everyone?  Still, rather than regret the absence of our neighbors, let us rejoice in the fellowship of those present.  Our choirmistress, Sister Mary Lazarus, has informed me that our choir, while always superior, has been toiling especially hard on this week's selection.  Sister? 
Mary Lazarus raises her hand, and the choir begins singing. They sing a traditional hymn, "Let Thy Thoughts Be Guided." As always, their singing is dreadful; they have no tempo or pitch, and the hymn becomes an off-key drone. 
As the hymn continues, the CAMERA PANS OVER the chapel. Aside from the nuns, it is almost empty; only a few elderly people are in attendance. 
ANGLE ON CHRISTY 
sitting with the other nuns.  She is clearly about to fall asleep.  Then the choir hits a particularly horrendous note, and Christy jerks awake.  She immediately tries to assume a pious expression, tilting her head and folding her hands in prayer; she looks like a somewhat demented Sunday School calendar. 
EXT. LAS VEGAS POLICE DEPARTMENT 
Detective Clarkson gets out of his car and hurries into the police station. 
INT. POLICE STATION 
Clarkson crosses the busy room to Eddie's glass-walled office.  Along the way, he signals Detective Tate to follow him. 
Page 37. 
INT. MULCAHY'S OFFICE 
Eddie looks up from his desk as the two detectives enter. 
CLARKSON There was a raid on a pawnshop in L.A. this morning.  The place was fencing stolen property.  They found this. 
Clarkson gives Eddie a fax sheet, showing a publicity photograph of Christy. 
EDDIE Jesus.  Data-base hoods.  It's a wonderful world. (reading the fax sheet) Beloved daughter missing.  Reward of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Please find our adored angel, we miss her so.  Dead or alive. 
TATE Vince is getting desperate.  Where is she, Eddie?  Where'd you stash her? 
EDDIE Where's who? 
TATE You won't even tell us? 
EDDIE I wouldn't even tell the Pope. 
INT. CONVENT SCHOOLROOM - AN HOUR LATER 
A plain whitewashed classroom, with battered student-style desks.  A group of about eight local TEENAGE GIRLS has gathered.  The girls wear extremes of hair, makeup and clothing; they are bored and scruffy, clearly the local bad Girls.  Sister Mary Patrick is leading the class, in her usual perky manner. 
MARY PATRICK Good afternoon, young ladies.  And welcome to our Christian Youth Group. 
The Girls make grunting noises. 
MARY PATRICK Hi.  I hope we'll have some fun, and maybe learn a little something, too. Now, today's topic is something very up-to- date -- "Teenage Promiscuity."  My. Now, can anyone tell me -- just what is promiscuity? 
ANGLE on the Girls, exchanging glances and rolling their eyes. 
Page 38 
MARY PATRICK Anyone?  Yes? 
Mary Patrick points to a Girl in bicycle pants. a bustier and a leather baseball cap.  Her name is Lawanda. 
LAWANDA Uh, it's like, you know, doin' it.  A whole lot.  Till your head falls off. 
MARY PATRICK (blushing) Well, yes.  That is one way to put it. 
Mother Superior enters the classroom accompanied by Christy 
MOTHER SUPERIOR Sister Mary Patrick? 
MARY PATRICK Yes? 
MOTHER SUPERIOR I need to see you, at once.  Girls, please excuse Sister Mary Patrick for a few moments.  Mary Clarence? 
CHRISTY Yeah? 
MOTHER SUPERIOR Girls, this is Sister Mary Clarence. She'll be minding you until Sister Mary Patrick's return.  Mary Clarence, please assign a biblical passage.  Do not attempt discussion.  Am I understood? 
CHRISTY I got it. 
MOTHER SUPERIOR (to Mary Patrick) Come, Sister. 
Mother Superior and Mary Patrick leave the classroom. Christy now stands at the front of the room.  She is visibly uncomfortable. 
CHRISTY So, hi there.  I'm... Sister Mary Clarence.  And you're... young Christians.  I guess I should assign you this passage.  What's good?  What were you talking about? 
LAWANDA We were talking about the wild thing. Teen promiscuity. 
Page 39 
CHRISTY (after a beat) Really. 
CHARLENE Yeah.  Sister Mary Pat was discussing it.  You know she thinks it's a sin. 
INT. VINCE'S OFFICE - DAY 
Vince is on the telephone in his office at the Moonlight Hotel and Casino.  He clearly has a new mistress or two. 
VINCE (very seductive) Baby, you know I do... of course... I feel it too... I'm blushing... can you hold? 
A second telephone RINGS, and Willy answers it.  Vince meanwhile has pushed a button on his phone and is involved in a second romantic call. 
VINCE Soon, you gorgeous thing... tell me... how lonely? 
WILLY It's that call you were expecting, Vince. 
VINCE Can you hold?  Can you try? 
Willy passes the phone to Vince. t 
Page 43 
VINCE Have you found out where Christy is yet? Hey, bozo, you re on my payroll! You want to try making it on a cop's salary?  Find her, and find her now! 
Vince passes the phone back to Willy. 
VINCE Raise the ante to three hundred grand. 
Willy heads for the fax machine.  Vince regains his composure, and picks up his own phone; he pushes a button. 
VINCE Sorry, baby... you are?  Totally?  Not a stitch?... Yeah, I'm naked too... inside... 
INT. CONVENT CRAFTS ROOM 
This is a large, open room where the nuns create various gift items which the convent sells to support itself. Several nuns sit at a table, diligently hand-painting Christmas cards and making Christmas tree ornaments. 
On the other side of the room is a large, free-standing loom, which resembles a grand piano.  The loom is wooden; a tapestry is half-completed.  Mary Patrick is seated at the loom, which is a complicated mechanism.  Christy stands beside her. 
MARY PATRICK The minute I saw you. I said to myself, she's a weaver.  Have you ever used a loom? 
CHRISTY Not in years. 
MARY PATRICK Well, it all comes back, in just a jiffy.  I'm working on a wall-hanging, of the convent. 
CHRISTY Why? 
MARY PATRICK To sell, of course.  I hate to say it, but we're in terrible trouble here at St. Katherine's.  We need a new roof, the furnace is going, and there's no money. 
CHRISTY But don't you get money?  From the Vatican? 
Page 44. 
MARY PATRICK Mary Clarence.  Goose.  We're completely self-supporting.  Like all convents. Like yours. 
CHRISTY Oh, right.  At my old place, we used to... wash cars.  Groom dogs.  So... nice loom. 
MARY PATRICK Isn't it lovely?  Now I'll demonstrate, and then you can hop right in. (as she deftly works the loom) You just draw your beater in, keep it pressed against the pick, and open the shed.  Then pass your shuttle, beat, and open the next shed.  Shuttle. beat, beat, shuttle, beat, shed.  Keep tension on the warp.  Is that clear? 
CHRISTY (pretending to be fascinated) Just about.  Show me again. 
MARY PATRICK You betcha. 
CRAFTS ROOM - AN HOUR LATER 
ANGLE on the wall hanging, which has progressed considerably. 
ANGLE on Christy, leaning against the wall, thumbing through a magazine. 
ANGLE on Mary Patrick, hard at work at the loom. 
MARY PATRICK Shuttle, beat, shed.  And watch your heddles. 
CHRISTY I love my heddles.  Show me again. 
Mother Superior appears. 
MOTHER SUPERIOR Mary Clarence -- how is your weaving progressing? 
MARY PATRICK Oh, she's doing just fine, Reverend Mother - 
Page 45. 
CHRISTY Really catching on. 
MOTHER SUPERIOR Good.  Mary Patrick, I need you in the office.  Mary Clarence, carry on. 
Mother Superior gestures to the loom.  Christy sits at the loom, and waves as Mother Superior and Mary Patrick exit. 
Christy stares at the loom; a look of horror crosses her face.  She has not been paying attention to Mary Patrick's instructions.  She cracks her knuckles, as if she were about to play the piano.  She grabs two parts of the loom, at random.  She moves these parts. 
ANGLE on the loom.  As a result of Christy's movements, the loom collapses, piece by piece.  The tapestry unravels, the many skeins of wool snap, and the mechanical apparatus disintegrates, until finally the entire loom shudders and falls to the floor, as Christy watches, aghast. 
INT. CORRIDOR 
Mother Superior is striding down the hall; she is livid. Christy trails behind her, trying to keep up. 
CHRISTY I'm sorry, I'm not a weaver! 
MOTHER SUPERIOR Months of work, and the loom, absolutely ruined! 
CHRISTY Yeah, like a learner's permit, right? When do you hit the big time?  You know, when do you take the final vows? 
Mary Robert bursts into tears. 
CHRISTY Whoa!  Bob!  What's going on here? What'd I say? 
Page 49. 
MARY ROBERT (still sobbing) You have to help me 
CHRISTY Right, sure, but what's the problem? Are they keeping you a prisoner here? Do they drug you?  Did Reverend Mother like, kidnap your parents?  We can call the Enquirer. 
MARY ROBERT No, you don't understand -- I don't want to get out!  I want to get in? 
CHRISTY Excuse me? 
MARY ROBERT Oh. Mary Clarence, I'm so unworthy.  I want to take my final vows, I would do it tomorrow, but Reverend Mother won't let me! 
CHRISTY She won't?  Why not? 
MARY ROBERT She says I should wait.  She says that no one should become a nun as an escape from life.  She says that I'm not experienced enough to make the decision yet.  In a mature manner. 
CHRISTY She said that?  Reverend Mother? 
Mary Robert nods, solemnly.  Suddenly, from the streets outside the convent, we hear a BLAST OF hot dance MUSIC, and the SOUND of laughter and carefree conversation. 
CHRISTY Well, then there's only one thing to do. 
MARY ROBERT What? 
CHRISTY Reverend Mother says you need experience, right, in life.  In order to make a responsible decision.  This is going to be very painful for me.  You know how much I love this little room. This whole convent.  Wait. 
Christy stands, and goes to the crucifix hanging on the wall.  She speaks to the crucifix, and listens, as if Jesus is advising her. 
Page 50. 
CHRISTY (to Jesus) Must I do this thing, 0 Lord?  Please help me.,. yes, I know... I must put my selfish cares aside... I must think of others... yes, she's here... (she gestures to Mary Robert) He says hi... yes, I understand... let thy will be done.  Amen.  You too. 
Christy turns to Mary Robert, having received a holy message. 
CHRISTY We must do this sacred thing, Mary Robert. 
MARY ROBERT (desperate) Of course!  We must do it!  It's the will of God!  What is it? 
CHRISTY (shutting her eyes, for the full spiritual effect) We must... get you some experience.  We must... leave this place. 
MARY ROBERT Are you sure? 
Another BLAST OF MUSIC from the street.  Christy turns to the crucifix.  She gets confirmation. 
CHRISTY (to Jesus) We hear you. 
EXT. STREET 
The outer wall of the convent.  A door swings open, and Christy sticks her head out.  She looks both ways, and steps outside.  She beckons to Mary Robert, who appears from behind her.  Mary Robert looks very wary.  Christy pulls her along. 
EXT. A STREET NEARBY 
Christy and Mary Robert walk along a street a few blocks from the convent. 
MARY ROBERT (looking around cautiously) Are you sure this is what Reverend Mother had in mind? 
Page 51. 
CHRISTY I know it is.  It's life.  Experience. Take a deep breath. 
Christy breathes deep, and then lets out a whoop.  She spins, letting her habit billow around her. 
MARY ROBERT (shocked) Mary Clarence! 
CHRISTY Now you. 
Mary Robert's eyes widen.  She points to herself -- "Me?" Christy nods.  Mary Robert lets out a tiny little whoop, and does a little, timid hop. 
CHRISTY It's a start. 
EXT. SOCIAL CLUB 
A neighborhood hang-out, the windows bright with neon beer signs.  The exterior is colorfully painted; the club all but explodes with good times.  A group of teenagers lounge on the steps, sipping beers and smoking.  Among the teenagers are the girls from Christy's Christian Youth group.  Christy and Mary Robert approach, and the group falls silent. 
CHRISTY How are you doing. 
LAWANDA (puzzled) Hey, Sisters.  Are you going in there? 
CHRISTY You know it. 
MARY ROBERT We need experience. 
CHRISTY (remembering she's a nun) It's part of St. Katherine's new community outreach program.  How old are you?  You shouldn't be smoking.  Have you ever seen a diseased lung?  Hand 'em over. 
Lawanda reluctantly hands over her cigarettes.  Christy turns to a TEENAGE BOY who's drinking beer. 
Page 52. 
CHRISTY And you, with the devil's brew passing through your lips. (holding out her hand) A mind is a terrible thing to waste. 
CHRISTY (to Mary Robert) Run! 
Christy shoves Mary Robert towards an alley.  As she does so, the gun GOES OFF with a red flash.  The shot misses the two women and SHATTERS a plate glass window of the store behind them. 
EXT. ALLEY 
Running up the alley, Christy and Mary Robert hear Mike's FOOTSTEPS chasing them, growing louder as he gains on them. 
MARY ROBERT Mary Clarence! 
CHRISTY Keep moving! 
Christy grabs the ladder of a fire escape, and shoves Mary Robert up the ladder ahead of her. 
CHRISTY Climb!  Now! 
As Christy and Mary Robert climb the fire escape, another GUNSHOT ECHOES in the alley, ricocheting off the fire escape. 
The nuns climb higher up the building.  Mike pursues, looking for a shot between the steps and the landings, but not finding any openings.  He takes the steps two at a time and begins to gain ground. 
At the fourth floor landing, Christy's heel gets stuck in the grating.  She pulls frantically at the laces. 
Page 56. 
CHRISTY Goddamn it! 
MARY ROBERT Mary Clarence! 
Mike arrives at the landing just as Christy twists her toot out of the shoe, and surprises him with a lunge for the gun.  Mike's hand is knocked back against the metal frame of the fire escape, and the gun flies loose, RATTLING down the metal steps to the landing below.  Christy shoves Mary Robert into the open window of an apartment, and follows her in. 
INT. TENEMENT APARTMENT 
Christy and Mary Robert leap into the bedroom of an Hispanic couple, their arms wrapped around each other in bed.  At the women's entrance, the couple looks up, stunned to see two nuns in their bedroom. 
MARY ROBERT Oh my Lord! 
CHRISTY (pushing Mary Robert forward) Experience! 
The couple continues to look stunned as the nuns race out of the room. 
EXT. CONVENT - NIGHT 
Christy and Mary Robert run up to the side door of the convent; they catch their breath. 
MARY ROBERT What was all that?  Who was that man? Why would he shoot at us? 
CHRISTY I don't know, some people just don't like nuns.  I wish I had a ruler. 
MARY ROBERT We could have been killed!  But you saved me! (throwing her arms around Christy) Thank you, Mary Clarence! 
The door to the convent swings open.  Mother Superior is waiting. 
MOTHER SUPERIOR Yes -- thank you so much. 
Page 57 
INT.CONVENT CORRIDOR - DAY 
Christy sits alone outside Mother Superior's office, listening to the loud TICKING of the clock on the wall. She seems small and vulnerable, like a child sent to the principal's office. 
The door opens and Eddie emerges from the office. 
CHRISTY What'd she say? 
EDDIE You blew it -- big time.  She doesn't want you back. 
CHRISTY Does she know people are trying to kill me out there? 
EDDIE She's counting on it.  She's concerned for your safety, but she wants me to try and find another convent that will take you. Or a carnival. 
CHRISTY So what am I supposed to do in the meantime? 
EDDIE Go in and talk to her.  It can't hurt. (urging her) Go. 
Reluctantly, Christy rises and approaches the door.  She looks at Eddie, who motions her to go in.  She finally does. 
INT. MOTHER SUPERIOR'S OFFICE 
Mother Superior is working on some papers at her desk as Christy enters.  Christy is trying to figure out a strategy. 
CHRISTY So... hi there. 
MOTHER SUPERIOR (not amused and not looking up) I don't believe we have anything to say to each other. 
CHRISTY Look... I know I shouldn't have, I'm incredibly sorry about Mary Robert, I wasn't thinking, I didn't know that would happen! 
Page 58. 
Mother Superior glances up from her work.  She is justifiably outraged. 
MOTHER SUPERIOR Mary Robert's life was in danger! Your behavior was inexcusable! 
CHRISTY I know!  I'm sorry   I didn't mean for it to happen!  And I was the one they were shooting at! 
MOTHER SUPERIOR Mary Clarence, I have given you every opportunity.  To change.  To make a decent life for yourself. 
JOEY A nun! 
INT. CHOIR REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY 
The choir continues its dreadful rendition of the hymn Let Thy Thoughts He Guided.  Christy is not singing; she is clearly in pain.  Mary Lazarus stops the song.  One of the nuns has to nudge Sister Alma to stop her playing. 
MARY LAZARUS Mary Clarence, are you with us? 
CHRISTY Um, I don't really know this one... 
MARY ROBERT Mary Clarence has a background in music. That's what Reverend Mother said. 
MARY PATRICK (eagerly) Really, Mary Clarence?  Were you a choirmistress? 
CHRISTY Sure.  Kind of... free-lance. 
MARY LAZARUS (circling Christy) Free-lance?  Oh really?  You think I don't see?  You think I took vows yesterday?  I know what you're up to. You and Reverend Mother. 
CHRISTY What? 
MARY LAZARUS You're a ringer.  She brought you in to replace me.  Out with the old. 
Page 62. 
CHRISTY Hold on. 
MARY PATRICK Mary Clarence, could you?  Mary Lazarus, you're terrific, but... (to Christy) Could you help us? 
ANOTHER NUN Please? 
ANOTHER NUN You've heard us. 
MARY LAZARUS Well. 
Everyone falls silent.  Mary Lazarus walks across the room, eyeballing each member of the choir. 
MARY LAZARUS There's a word for this -- mutiny. (to Christy) So, Mary Clarence, you think you can do better.  I believe I'd like to see that. (she hands Christy her pitchpipe and baton) I'm out to pasture.  Dry dock.  The glue factory.  Go ahead, Sister -- make 'em sing. 
Everyone watches Christy. 
CHRISTY Well... (to Nary Lazarus) With all due respect... let's have a look at this. 
Christy goes over to the piano.  She examines the sheet music for "Let They Thoughts He Guided."  She sits at the piano, beside Sister Alma.  Christy picks out the hymn on the piano, accompanying herself. 
CHRISTY LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED LET THY SOUL BE HEALED 
Christy's singing voice is, as usual, not very good.  She stops singing.  For perhaps the first time in her life, she has really heard herself. 
CHRISTY Man.  I sound like you guys. 
Page 63. 
MARY LAZARUS (victorious) Very nice.  Sisters, have we learned our lesson?  I won't hold this little episode against anyone.  I'll try not to. 
CHRISTY (standing) Mary Robert. 
Mary Robert jumps, startled by the attention. 
MARY ROBERT What? 
CHRISTY Mary Robert, I've watched you.  You never really sing.  You whisper. Nothing comes out. 
MARY ROBERT I don't want to mess anyone up... 
CHRISTY (to Sister Alma) Give me a C. (because Sister Alma is hard of hearing) A C! 
Sister Alma plays the note.  Christy points the baton at Mary Robert.  Mary Robert whispers the note. 
CHRISTY Louder!  Like you're onstage. 
Mary Robert sings a little louder. 
CHRISTY Like people are eating, and there's silverware, and you want them to hear you. 
Mary Robert sings louder still. 
CHRISTY Think about that guy you were dancing with! 
Mary Robert finally lets out her full voice, which is huge and glorious.  After singing a single perfect note, she stops abruptly; she has scared herself. 
MARY ROBERT Oh my! 
Page 64. 
CHRISTY You see?  We've got the voices.  They're just allover the place. I've heard all of you, in the shower --you're decent. Better than me.  We just need charts -- harmony -- chops. 
MARY PATRICK (puzzled) Chops? 
CHRISTY The goods.  The sound.  The sale.  Let's rearrange a few things.  Mary Patrick, you re not a natural soprano, you're an alto.  Get over here.  Mary Robert --with the sopranos. 
The two nuns trade places. 
CHRISTY Sister Alma -- a C. 
Sister Alma plays the note, and the nuns try to duplicate it, but the results aren't much better than before. Christy uses her pitchpipe; she circulates among the nuns, giving each her note, urging them closer to pitch. 
Mother Superior takes one more glance around, then leaves. 
Now that the coast is clear, the singing begins again, quietly, to the rhythm of the machine. 
NUNS GOING TO THE CHAPEL... 
INT. CHAPEL 
Bishop O'Hara is leading the Sunday Mass. 
BISHOP O'HARA Welcome this Sunday morning, 0 ye few and faithful. 
Page 68. 
As usual, the chapel is almost empty, except for the nuns. The choir is in place behind the pulpit. 
BISHOP O'HARA The choir, I am told, has elected a new director -- Sister Mary Clarence, who will lead them in Hymn 127. 
Christy nods to the Bishop, and signals to Sister Alma, who begins the accompaniment. 
CHOIR LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED LET THY SOUL BE HEALED 
They sound fantastic.  Their voices blend with a heavenly harmony as they sing the slow, melodic hymn.  Mother Superior is startled by this new sound. 
EXT. STREET 
Lawanda and her friends glance at the convent with curiosity as the beautiful MUSIC drifts out to the street. A few other heads turn, but with only mild reactions. 
INT. CHAPEL 
At the end of the first verse, Christy signals the choir to stop.  There's a hush in the chapel as Christy glances at the vacant pews.  Then she turns to Sister Alma and nods. Sister Alma strikes a bold, stirring chord. 
Several of the nuns blink.  Bishop O'Hara glances at the organ with surprise.  Mother Superior sits up with a stiffened back and a severe expression. 
As the chord grows in force, Christy gives the choir a beat. 
CHRISTY One, two, three... 
The choir begins a radically new version of the same hymn. Christy strides up and down in front of the choir, transforming the song into a rousing gospel anthem, with a passionate call-and-response format. 
CHOIR LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED 
CHRISTY What you say? 
CHOIR LET THY SOUL BE HEALED 
Page 69. 
CHRISTY But how? 
CHOIR BY A VOICE YOU HEAR FROM ON HIGH 
CHRISTY I think I hear it! 
CHOIR LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED 
CHRISTY You know, I just might! 
CHOIR LET THY SOUL BE HEALED 
CHRISTY AND CHOIR LET THY SPIRIT TAKE WING AND FLY! 
Spontaneous reactions from everyone in the church. 
EXT. STREET 
The gorgeous, exciting MUSIC pours into the street. Everyone turns to look.  Windows open and people glance out. The street takes on a new movement. 
INT. CHAPEL 
The choir really lets loose flow. 
CHRISTY AND CHOIR LET THY THOUGHTS BE STRENGTHENED LET THY PRAYERS BE HEARD LET OUR LORD REJOICE IN YOUR PRAISE LET HIS GOODNESS LIFT YOU TO A HIGHER PLACE AND LET LOVE AND PEACE FILL YOUR DAYS 
Lawanda and her friends peer in at the back door of the chapel.  Bishop O'Hara sees them, and beckons them to come in. 
CHRISTY Sister Alma! 
Sister Alma, inspired by Christy and the choir, burns up the organ with a solo.  More people from the street begin to enter; tentative, curious, drawn by the music. 
At the end of the solo, Christy makes a gesture to the choir, and each member produces a tambourine.  The chapel is full of energy, music and life. 
CHRISTY Mary Robert! 
Page 70. 
Mary Robert sings, really letting the power of her voice ring out.  She is astonishingly good. 
MARY ROBERT LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED LET THY SOUL BE HEALED BY A VOICE YOU HEAR FROM ON HIGH LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED LET THY SOUL BE HEALED LET THY SOUL TAKE WING AND FLY! 
The new visitors to the church begin to clap in rhythm to the music, and after a few beats, the nuns join in.  Mother Superior is aghast. 
The choir builds to a huge gospel finish, all keeping their eyes on Christy. 
CHOIR LET THY SPIRIT 
Page 80. 
Christy hurries toward the chapel, leaving Eddie to shake his head and wonder. 
INT. CHAPEL 
Sister Alma plays the organ, and the choir hums quietly as Christy addresses the congregation.  Cameras from several TV stations are focussed on her from various places in the chapel. 
CHRISTY This Sunday's hymn is inspired by the lesson of Mary Magdalene.  You know the one.  Mary Magdalene was a young lady with a past.  She was no stranger to sin. She was no stranger to practically everybody.  Many condemned her.  The whole neighborhood.  But one man refused to do so.  One man said, hey now, wait a minute.  Listen to the story. 
Sister Alma starts playing a doo-wop vamp.  Mary Patrick and Mary Robert step forward from the choir, standing beside Christy the way the Ronelles used to do. 
CHRISTY Hey, girls. 
MARY PATRICK AND ROBERT Hail, Mary. 
CHRISTY Jerusalem is a real drag.  Everybody hates me. 
MARY PATRICK AND ROBERT Oh-huh. 
CHRISTY People throw stones.  They call me names.  I mean, really. 
MARY PATRICK AND ROBERT Really. 
CHRISTY But -- wait. 
MARY PATRICK What is it, Mary? 
CHRISTY That man -- who is he? 
MARY ROBERT He's a carpenter. 
Page 81 
MARY PATRICK He's not like other guys. 
MARY ROBERT He's decent. 
MARY PATRICK He's kind. 
CHRISTY He's... dreamy.  He's... 
CHOIR Yes, Mary? 
CHRISTY HE'S SO FINE... 
The full choir sings back-up while Christy, Mary Patrick and Mary Robert perform intricate girl group choreography. 
CHOIR DOO- LANG, DOO-LANG, DOO- LANG. 
CHRISTY/MARY ROBERT/ MARY PATRICK WISH HE WAS MINE THAT HANDSOME GUY OVER THERE THE ONE WITH THE WAVY HAIR 
Sister Alma is surrounded by several STREET KIDS who play guitar, bass and drums to accompany the organ and choir. 
Lawanda and her friends sit in a pew, moving joyously to the music. 
Eddie stands in the back of the chapel, watching a Christy he has never seen before.  Christy is now glowing with happiness and confidence. 
As the song continues, we see the chapel is packed to the rafters.  A tin bucket is passed around as a collection plate, and it overflows with money. 
EXT. CONVENT 
Church services are over, and happy people stream out of the convent, but they don't hurry home.  Standing in groups, they talk pleasantly and make plans for the day. There is a real sense of neighborhood up and down the block. 
Eddie comes down the steps, glances back at the convent, smiles to himself, then crosses the street to his car. 
Page 82. 
INT. CHAPEL 
Christy and the choir stare at the collection plate that is filled with money. 
CHRISTY Jackpot!  Two buckets 
MARY PATRICK This is so exhilarating!  All week long, I can't wait till Sunday, when we sing. 
MARY ROBERT I'd rather sing than do anything! 
MARY PATRICK It's better than ice cream. 
MARY ROBERT It's better than springtime. 
CHRISTY It's better than sex! 
Everyone looks at Christy with astonishment. 
CHRISTY (catching herself) I imagine. 
Everyone's attention suddenly turns to Bishop O'Hara as he approaches. 
O'HARA Better and better, Sisters, you are truly an inspiration.  And I bear gladsome tidings. 
The choir gathers around O'Hara with curiosity. 
O'HARA I've kept the Cardinal informed of your progress in the neighborhood.  He has been most impressed.  And he has invited you to attend a special evening Mass at St. Matthew's Cathedral on Sunday night1 to sing for the Council of Cardinals. 
Eddie grabs her hand and pulls her toward the side staircase. 
EDDIE Vince knows you're here. 
CHRISTY (shocked and scared) How? 
EDDIE Long story.  His goons will be here any minute.  We've got to get you out of here '- now! 
Christy and Eddie hurry down the steps to the side entrance, and she almost trips on her choral robes.  Eddie opens the door and starts outside, but Christy stops in her tracks. 
CHRISTY I can't go with you. 
EDDIE What? 
CHRISTY I've got a show -- at St. Matthew's Cathedral.  We're singing for the Cardinals. 
EDDIE You're gonna be singing for St. Peter if you don't get your ass out of here! 
Eddie jerks her hand, and Christy follows him reluctantly to the car. 
INT. EDDIE'S CAR 
Eddie takes off at a fast clip up the street.  As the car cruises through an intersection, Christy looks back at the bus with confusion and sadness.  She sees the other nuns rushing back into the convent to look for her. 
INT. REHEARSAL ROOM 
Several members of the choir rush into the room with panic in their eyes. 
MARY PATRICK Mary Clarence!  Sister! 
MARY ROBERT It's no use.  She just isn't here. 
Page 93. 
MARY PATRICK It doesn't make any sense.  She was right behind me... 
The HORN on the school bus blows loudly down in the street. 
MARY ROBERT We can't sing without her!  What should we do? 
MARY PATRICK (calming herself) We'll pray -- and she'll be there. 
The nuns are calmed by the tone of Mary Patrick's voice. They leave the room to join the others on the bus. 
EXT. STREET - DAY 
Eddie's police car streaks through crowded streets. 
INT. EDDIE'S CAR 
Christy still looks unsettled. 
CHRISTY Eddie -- I've got to go back.  They won't sing without me.  I'm deserting them. 
EDDIE I think they'd understand. 
CHRISTY That's not the point!  They need me! 
Eddie glances at her, impressed by the influence the convent has had. 
EDDIE They need you?  A bunch of nuns?  For what?  Moral guidance?  Make-up tips? 
CHRISTY You don't get it!  It's a big thing for them, it's like... Caesar's Palace. Prime-time.  They're singing for the Cardinals.  It's like... "Star Search." If first prize was a trip to the Vatican. They've worked really hard, they deserve this. 
EDDIE (goading her) Nuns? 
Page 94. 
CHRISTY They're not nuns.  They're like.. people.  With one outfit. 
EXT. CONVENT - DAY 
Joey and Willy park their car in front of the convent, get out quickly and climb the steps to the front door.  They ring the bell. 
JOEY So that guy in the bar was right?  She's like... some kind of nun? 
WILLY Yeah, right -- when I see it. 
Lawanda and her friends watch Joey and Willy pounding on the convent door. 
LAWANDA You dudes looking for nuns?  They all went to St. Matthew's. 
JOEY St, Matthew's?  Thanks. 
LAWANDA Praise the Lord. 
Joey and Willy run past the girls, get into their car and take off. 
INT. EDDIE'S CAR - DAY 
Eddie glances at the dashboard and sees that the fuel gauge is close to empty.  He wheels into a gas station and pulls up to the tanks.  Christy starts to open the door, but he stops her. 
EDDIE What're you doing? 
CHRISTY Even nuns have to pee. 
Page 98. 
EXT. ALLEY - DAY 
Joey and Willy wrestle the two nuns to the open door of their car.  They shove Christy and Mary Robert into the back seat, and Willy climbs in next to them. 
WILLY Go! 
Joey starts the car, and it takes off with SQUEALING tires.  Willy has his gun pointed at Christy, who sits beside Mary Robert. 
MARY ROBERT But what do they want?  Where are we going? 
CHRISTY (to Joey and Willy) She's got nothing to do with this.  Let her go. 
JOEY Yeah, right to the cops.  No way. 
CHRISTY Mary Robert, don't panic.  Remember what we talked about?  Experience? 
JOEY What? 
CHRISTY (quickly, to Mary Robert) You can handle this. 
The car comes to a stop at an intersection.  Christy reaches across Mary Robert and opens the car door.  She shoves Mary Robert into the street. 
CHRISTY Go! 
Mary Robert executes a perfect somersault onto the sidewalk.  She looks to heaven, crosses herself and runs back to the cathedral. 
Willy grabs Christy before she can escape. 
JOEY She's gettin' away! 
WILLY Forget her!  We got the one we need! Step on it! 
Joey takes off again. 
Page 99. 
EXT. STREET 
Eddie's car is tied up in traffic, but he turns on his blinker lights and peels over to the opposite lane.  Cars stop to let him through. 
INT. ST. MATTHEW'S CATHEDRAL - DAY 
In the rehearsal room, Mary Robert has just finished telling the nuns what happened to Christy. 
MARY PATRICK You mean -- they kidnapped her? 
MARY ROBERT Yes -- two men -- and they had guns. 
MOTHER SUPERIOR She shouldn't have come back.  She knew she was in danger. 
MARY PATRICK But -- why would anyone kidnap a nun? 
MARY LAZARUS Were they Catholics? 
Mother Superior suddenly steps forward. 
MOTHER SUPERIOR She isn't a nun.  Her real name is Christy Van Cartier, and she is a professional entertainer.  She witnessed a vicious crime, and has been hiding in our convent. 
The nuns all react with shock and emotion. 
MARY ROBERT An... entertainer? 
MARY PATRICK She wasn't a nun? 
ANOTHER NUN She lied to us? 
MARY ROBERT But... but... she was such a wonderful nun. 
MARY PATRICK Look what she did with the choir.  She made us sing beautifully. 
MARY LAZARUS That should have tipped us. 
Page 100. 
MARY ROBERT Well, I don't care who she is.  We can't sing without her! 
MARY PATRICK She's our inspiration! 
MARY LAZARUS She's the act! 
MARY ROBERT Reverend Mother, I know that you and Mary Clarence didn't always agree, but -- we've got to help her. 
MARY PATRICK We've got to save her! 
MARY LAZARUS We can't leave it up to the Feds! 
The nuns all look to Mother Superior for an answer. 
MOTHER SUPERIOR Calm down.  Think clearly.  Mary Robert, do you have any idea who those men were? 
MARY ROBERT She said they were from her old convent. 
MOTHER SUPERIOR But... she was a showgirl.  She didn't have an old convent. 
Vince follows Joey out of the casino with a grim expression. 
INT. STORAGE ROOM 
Vince and Joey enter a storage room that is cluttered with boxes.  Christy is tied to a chair in the back of the room, with Willy standing guard over her. 
Christy sits very calmly, despite the anger she is in. She seems distinctly nun-like in her radiant serenity. 
VINCE (turning on the charm) Babe. 
Christy does not reply. 
VINCE Babe, what happened here?  Look at you. 
CHRISTY Good evening, Vincent. 
VINCE What, Vincent?  This is me, doll.  I know you.  What did you think you were doing?  Running to the cops.  Hiding out. No, no.  You're sorry now, aren't you? 
CHRISTY I am sorry for all my sins.  And yours. 
Vince, Willy and Joey all look at each other, perplexed. 
WILLY She's a nun, Vince. 
VINCE (kneeling by Christy) I love you, Chris.  I always will.  I gave you so much.  My time.  My affection.  A big-time career.  And how do you repay me?  What's the thanks I get?  Where's the loyalty, huh?  Where's the love? 
CHRISTY You will be judged, Vincent.  We all will. 
Vince stands; the charm hasn't worked.  He's getting angry. 
VINCE What do you mean -- judged?  I don't get judged, baby. (MORE) 
Page 104. 
VINCE (CONT'D) And who are you to talk?  You were nothing.  You couldn't even sing.  I must have been out of my mind. 
WILLY She's acting weird, Vince.  Ever since we picked her up. 
JOEY It's spooky.  It's like she ain't even afraid or nothing. 
Vince grabs the front of Christy's habit and squeezes it tightly around her throat. 
VINCE She's afraid.  Come on, tell the boys you're afraid. 
CHRISTY (calmly) I feel sorry for you, Vincent.  And I forgive you. 
This really throws Vince, and angers him further.  He glares at Christy, and then releases her.  He turns to Joey and Willy. 
VINCE Who gives a damn?  Waste her. 
Joey and Willy look a little unsure as Vince storms out of the room. 
INT. PLANE 
The nuns are mesmerized by the bright skyline with its colorful flashes of neon. 
MARY PATRICK It's so beautiful... 
MARY ROBERT And what a lovely name.  Las Vegas... 
MOTHER SUPERIOR And Gommorah. 
The plane sets down at the Vegas airport.  Mother Superior and the nuns climb out. 
INT. BAR AREA 
Joey and Willy find Vince near the bar. 
Page 105. 
VINCE It's done? 
JOEY Not... totally. 
VINCE (disturbed) What's the problem? 
WILLY She's... she's a nun. 
VINCE Are you nuts?  She's not a nun.  It's Christy.  She's a babe! 
JOEY But, Vince, how do you know she didn't like, join up and become a nun when she was in that convent? 
VINCE It didn't happen. 
WILLY She was real quiet and peaceful all the way back in the car. 
JOEY No smart-ass remarks or nothing. 
VINCE I can't believe this.  Okay, I want both you guys to go back there, and both of you shoot her at the same time. 
JOEY Yeah... 
WILLY Right.  That way we'd never know which bullet got to her brain and killed her first.  It could always be the other guy. 
They all look happy with this solution as Joey and Willy leave. 
CHRISTY What? 
JOEY That... thing.  That nun thing.  Take it off. 
Christy suddenly drops to her knees and begins to pray. 
WILLY What's she doing? 
JOEY She's praying. 
CHRISTY And God bless Joey and Willy, who are only trying to do their jobs. (faking Latin) Pox fibula tibia vobiscum.  Et marcus domino's pizza.  Have mercy.  Amen. (she looks up at the guys) I'm finished now.  Help me up. 
As Joey and Willy bend down to help her up, Christy suddenly grabs their neckties in each hand.  With a fierce jerk, she pulls the neckties with all her might, smashing Joey's head against Willy's.

Stunned, Joey and Willy stagger backward, holding their heads.  Christy scrambles out the door while the two men groan in pain. 
INT. CORRIDOR 
Joey and Willy burst out of the room with guns drawn.  At the far end of the corridor, they spot a glimpse of black clothing as Christy starts down the stairs. 
JOEY There she goes!  she's taking the stairs I 
They run quickly after her. 
INT. STAIRWAY 
Christy runs down the stairs as a SHOT rings out.  Christy screams and runs even faster. 
INT. CASINO 
A door swings open into the casino, and Christy appears, looking frantic.  A MUFFLED SHOT is heard behind her, and she sprints into the casino. 
Seconds later, Joey and Willy appear. 
JOEY Find Vince and tell him what happened. I'll take this side of the room. 
Willy hurries away to find Vince, and Joey starts searching the crowd. 
EXT. THE MOONLIGHT HOTEL AND CASINO 
Three cabs ROAR up in front of the building and nuns tumble out. 
INT. CASINO ENTRANCE 
The nuns enter the casino and stop dead in their tracks. Before them is a large room filled with glitter and sin, the SOUND of jackpots and crap tables. 
MOTHER SUPERIOR Brace yourselves, Sisters. 
In unison, the nuns all cross themselves. 
MOTHER SUPERIOR Spread out and look for Mary Clarence. Try to blend in. 
The nuns spread to every part of the room, looking for Christy.

INT. CASINO 
A blackjack table; a game is in progress, with several players.  Mary Patrick rushes up to the table. 
MARY PATRICK Excuse me -- has anyone seen a nun? 
MARY ROBERT A Benedictine. 
The CROUPIER and the players stare at the two nuns. 
INT. CASINO 
Christy is making her way past a roulette table. Suddenly, she sees Joey coming toward her, making his way through the crowd.  Christy grabs the arm of a SALESMAN playing roulette. 
CROUPIER Place your bets. 
CHRISTY (to the Salesman) Red 21. 
SALESMAN You sure?  How do you know? 
Christy looks up to heaven. 
SALESMAN (to the Croupier) Red 21. 
Joey stands at the opposite side of the roulette table, glaring at Christy.  The crowd around the table watches Christy for a moment, then they all put their chips down on Red 21. 
Joey starts working his way around the table toward Christy as the Croupier spins the wheel.  The ball falls into a slot. 
CROUPIER Black 14. 
Everyone at the table turns toward Christy, outraged.  She gives them a reprimanding look. 
CHRISTY Did you learn something? 
Christy suddenly realizes that Joey is almost at her side. She shoves the Salesman against him and runs away. 
Page 111. 
JOEY There! 
Before he can shoot, there is another flash of fabric on the opposite side of the room. 
VINCE (aiming) No -- there! 
And a third flash of fabric near the stage. 
JOEY Over there! 
Willy has found the lights, and the lounge is suddenly brightly lit.  The mobsters blink for a moment, then find all the nuns bunched together in a corner, trying to find an exit. 
VINCE Freeze!  Everybody! 
Page 114. 
The nuns turn and face the mobsters, shielding Christy. 
VINCE Joey? 
JOEY Where is she? 
Christy steps forward, to the front of the stage. 
CHRISTY Right here.  Let the others go -- they have nothing to do with this. 
VINCE Joey -- do it. 
JOEY But, boss -- she's still, you know, a nun. 
VINCE She's a broad!  Got it!  Just some broad! 
Mother Superior steps forward. 
MOTHER SUPERIOR (with authority) I guarantee you, she is no broad.  She is Sister Mary Clarence, of St. Katherine's Convent.  She is a model of generosity, virtue and love.  You have my word, gentlemen.  She is a nun. 
WILLY Hear that?  Now aren't you glad we didn't shoot her? 
Vince has had enough.  Facing Christy, he raises the gun and points it right between Christy's eyes, only inches away.  The nuns all recoil with horror. 
BLAM!  The gun goes off, but Christy isn't hit.  She blinks her eyes open, shocked to be alive.  Instead, it's Vince who falls, crumpling to the floor, and clutching his shoulder. 
Across the room, Eddie holds a smoking police revolver. The nuns all swarm around Christy joyously. 
MARY ROBERT Mary Clarence -- you're alive! 
MARY PATRICK (smiling) Christy. 
Page 115. 
MARY LAZARUS (also smiling) Van Cartier. 
CHRISTY You know?  About me?  About everything? 
Christy breaks away from the jubilant nuns. She faces Mother Superior. 
CHRISTY Reverend Mother -- Thank-you. 
MOTHER SUPERIOR Oh? 
CHRISTY You saved my life. 
MOTHER SUPERIOR I'm a Christian. 
Police pour into the room and gather up Joey, Willy and Vince.  Eddie walks over to Christy and Mother Superior. 
EDDIE Don't you have a concert to go to? 
CHRISTY That depends.  Sisters, you don't know this, but Reverend Mother's been making all sorts of noises about resigning. That's bad news.  I don't know if we could sing, if we thought that was true. 
MARY ROBERT Not a note. 
MARY PATRICK Impossible. 
Mary Lazarus coughs, and points to her throat, as if she has laryngitis.  All the other nuns imitate her. 
CHRISTY (to Mother Superior) Then I guess you're stuck.  Life sentence.  No parole. 
MOTHER SUPERIOR Very well. (she turns to Eddie) I hold you responsible for all of this, For introducing a lounge act into my convent.  For utterly disrupting our way of life.  And for placing all of us in mortal danger. (sincerely, with a smile) Thank-you. 
Page 116. 
ANGLE on Christy, watching this.  She grins. 
CHRISTY Yeah, Eddie, thanks a whole bunch. Thanks for sticking me in a convent.  So you think, after all this, maybe I really am a nun? 
EDDIE I don't know.  There's only one way to be absolutely sure. 
CHRISTY Yeah, like what? 
Eddie takes Christy in his arms, and they begin a kiss. As they do so, Vince struggles toward Christy, as two cops hold him back.  He is furious. 
VINCE I was good to you! You re nothing but no-talent garbage! You're a two-bit Tramp! 
CHRISTY (staring at Vince, seeing him for the scum that he is) That used to be true, Vince.  I was with you.  But something happened.  And I'm different now.  Real--different.  I've had, well, you might call it -- a religious experience.  And I've got just two words for you.  And those two words are...

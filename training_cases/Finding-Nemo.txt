FINDING NEMO Transcript v1.0 Copyright 2003 Walt Disney Pictures, Pixar Animation Studios Transcribed by BaD_BURN email : markgonzalez154@hotmail.com 
| Okay, this is the work-in-progress FINDING NEMO film transcript.  | | Why is it 'work-in-progress' you might ask? Well for one, this    | | isn't a 100% accurate transcript: some words might be missing,    | | may not be right. Second, some lines may or may not have been     | | spoken by the right character. There are instances in the film    | | where a line is spoken but the character isn't on screen, which   | | makes things complicated. But I'd say this transcript is about    | | 98-99% accurate. Dialogue for each scene is seperated by a line   | | of equal signs (=).                                               | | This transcript is open for corrections, additions if you have    | | any. What you CAN'T do, however, is to edit it and take credit    | | for it. Although I do not own the movie or it's screenplay, this | | transcript was made with no intention of copyright infringement | | and the like. Enjoy. And remember: 'Fish are friends, not food'. | 
MARLIN Wow. 
CORAL Mmm. 
MARLIN Wow. 
CORAL Mmm-hmm. 
MARLIN Wow. 
CORAL Yes, Marlin. No, I see it. It's beautiful. 
MARLIN So, Coral, when you said you wanted an ocean view, you didn't think that we we're gonna get the whole ocean, did you? Huh? [sighs] Oh yeah. A fish can breath out here. Did your man deliver or did he deliver? 
CORAL My man delivered. 
MARLIN And it wasn't so easy. 
CORAL Because a lot of other clownfish had their eyes on this place. 
MARLIN You better believe they did--every single one of them. 
CORAL Mm-hmm. You did good. And the neighborhood is awesome. 
MARLIN So, you do like it, don't you? 
CORAL No, no. I do, I do. I really do like it. But Marlin, I know that the drop off is desirable with the great schools and the amazing view and all, but do we really need so much space? 
MARLIN Coral, honey, these are our kids we're talking about. They deserve the best. Look, look, look. They'll wake up, poke their little heads out and they'll see a whale! See, right by their bedroom window. 
CORAL Shhh, you're gonna wake the kids. 
MARLIN Oh, right. Right. 
CORAL Aww, look. They're dreaming. We still have to name them. 
MARLIN You wanna name all of 'em, right now? All right, we'll name this half Marlin Jr. and then this half Coral Jr. Okay, we're done. 
CORAL I like Nemo. 
MARLIN Nemo? Well, we'll name one Nemo but I'd like most of them to be Marlin Jr. 
CORAL Just think that in a couple of days, we're gonna be parents! 
MARLIN Yeah. What if they don't like me? 
CORAL Marlin. 
MARLIN No, really. 
CORAL There's over 400 eggs. Odds are, one of them is bound to like you. 
CORAL What? 
MARLIN You remember how we met? 
CORAL Well, I try not to. 
MARLIN Well, I remember. 'Excuse me, miss, can you check and see if there's a hook in my lip?' 
CORAL Marlin! 
MARLIN 
'Well, you gotta look a little closer because it's wiggling'. 
CORAL Get away! 
NEMO Where? 
MARLIN There. Ha ha! Right there. And here and here and here! 
MARLIN All right, we're excited. First day of school, here we go. We're ready to learn to get some knowledge. Now, what's the one thing we have to remember about the ocean? 
NEMO It's not safe. 
MARLIN That's my boy. So, first we check to see that the coast is clear. We go out and back in. And then we go out, and back in. And then one more time--out and back in. And sometimes, if you wanna do it four times-- 
NEMO Dad.. 
MARLIN All right. Come on, boy. 
NEMO Dad, maybe while I'm at school, I'll see a shark! 
MARLIN 
I highly doubt that. 
NEMO Have you ever met a shark? 
MARLIN No, and I don't plan to. 
NEMO How old are sea turtles? 
MARLIN Sea turtles? I don't know. 
NEMO Sandy Plankton from next door, he said that sea turtles, said that they live to be about a hundred years old! 
MARLIN Well, you know what, if I ever meet a sea turtle, I'll ask him. After I'm done talking to the shark, okay? Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold on, hold on, wait to cross. Hold my fin, hold my fin. 
NEMO Dad, you're not gonna freak out like you did at the petting zoo, are you? 
MARLIN Hey, that snail was about to charge. Hmm, I wonder where we're supposed to go. 
FISH KIDS Bye, mom! 
FISH MOM I'll pick you up after school. 
CRAB KID Come on, you guys. Stop it! Give it back! 
MARLIN Come on, we'll try over there. 
MARLIN Excuse me, is this where we meet his teacher? 
BOB Well, look who's out of the anemone. 
MARLIN Yes. Shocking, I know. 
BOB Marty, right? 
MARLIN Marlin. 
BOB Bob. 
TED Ted. 
BILL Bill. Hey, you're a clownfish. You're funny, right? Hey, tell us a joke. 
BOB/TED Yeah, yeah. Come on, give us a funny one. 
MARLIN Well, actually, that's a common misconception. Clownfish are no funnier than any other fish. 
BILL Aw, come on, clownie. 
TED Yeah, do something funny. 
BOB Yeah! 
MARLIN All right, I   know one joke. Um, there's a mollusk, see? And he walks up to a sea, well he doesn't walk   up, he swims up. Well, actually the mollusk isn't moving. He's in one place and then the   sea cucumber, well they--I mixed up. There was a mollusk and a sea cucumber. None of them   were walking, so forget that I-- 
MARLIN Bye, Nemo! 
NEMO Bye, dad! 
MARLIN Bye, son! Be safe. 
BOB Hey, you're doing pretty well for a first timer. 
MARLIN Well, you can't hold onto them forever, can you? 
BILL Yeah, I had a tough time when my oldest went out at the drop off. 
MARLIN They just gotta grow up--the drop off?! They're going to the drop off?! Wh-what are you, insane?! Why don't we fry 'em up now and serve them with chips!? 
BOB Hey, Marty. Calm down. 
MARLIN Don't tell me to be calm, pony boy! 
BOB 'Pony boy'? 
BILL You know for a clownfish, he really isn't that funny. 
TED Pity. 
MR. RAY [singing] Oh, let's name the species, the species, the species. Let's name the species that live in thesea. 
NEMO Whoa. 
MR. RAY [singing] There's porifera, coelenterata, hydrozoa, scyphozoa, anthozoa, ctenophora, bryozoas, three! Gastropoda, arthropoda, echinoderma, and some fish like you and me. Come on, sing with me. Oh...! 
MR. RAY Just the girls this time. [singing] Oh, seaweed is cool. Seaweed is fun. It makes it's food with the rays of the sun... 
MR. RAY Okay, the drop off. All right, kids, feel free to explore but stay close. [gasps] Stromalitic cyanobacteria! Gather. An entire ecosystem contained in one infinitesimal speck. There are as many protein pairs contained in this... 
TAD Come on, let's go. 
MR. RAY Come on, sing with me! [singing] There's porifera, coelentera, hydrozoa, scyphozoa, anthozoa, ctenophora, bryozoas, three! 
NEMO Hey guys, wait up! Whoa. 
TAD Cool. 
TAD Saved your life! 
PEARL Aw, you guys made me ink. 
NEMO What's that? 
TAD I know what that is. Oh, oh! Sandy Plankton saw one. He called, he said it was called a...a butt. 
NEMO Whoa. 
PEARL Wow. That's a pretty big butt. 
SHELDON Oh, look at me. I'm gonna go touch the butt. [sneezes] Whoa! 
SHELDON Oh yeah? Let's see you get closer. 
PEARL Okay. Beat that. 
TAD Come on, Nemo. How far can you go? 
NEMO Uh, my dad says it's not safe. 
MARLIN Nemo, no! 
NEMO Dad? 
MARLIN You were about to swim into open water! 
NEMO No, I wasn't go out--but dad! 
MARLIN You have? 
DORY It passed by not too long ago. 
MARLIN A white one? 
DORY Hi. I'm Dory. 
MARLIN Where!? Which way!? 
DORY Oh, oh, oh! It-it went, um, this way! And it went this way! Follow me! 
MARLIN 
Thank you! Thank you, thank you so much! 
DORY No problem. 
MARLIN Hey! Wait! 
DORY Will you quit it? 
MARLIN What? 
DORY I'm trying to swim here. What, ocean ain't big enough for you? 
MARLIN Huh? 
DORY You got a problem, buddy? Huh? Huh? Do 'ya? Do 'ya? Do 'ya? You want a piece of me? Yeah, oooh, I'm scared now. Whaat!? 
MARLIN Wait a minute.. 
DORY Stop following me, okay!? 
MARLIN What? You're showing me which way the boat went! 
DORY A boat? Hey, I've seen a boat. It passed by not too long ago. It went this way, it went this way. Follow me! 
MARLIN Wait a minute, wait a minute! What is going on? You already told me which way the boat was going! 
DORY I did? Oh dear... 
MARLIN If this is some kind of practical joke, it's not funny! And I know funny..I'm a clownfish! 
DORY No, it's not. I know it's not. I'm so sorry. See, I suffer from short-term memory loss. 
MARLIN Short-term memory loss..I don't believe this! 
DORY No, it's true. I forget things almost instantly. It runs in my family..or at least I think it does. Hmmm..where are they? Can I help you? 
MARLIN Something's wrong with you, really. You're wasting my time. I have to find my son. [gasps] 
BRUCE Hello. 
DORY Well, hi! 
BRUCE Name's Bruce. It's all right, I understand. Why trust a shark, right? So, what's a couple of bites like you doing out so late, eh? 
MARLIN Nothing. We're not doing anything. We're not even out. 
BRUCE Great! Then how'd you morsels like to come to a little get-together I'm havin'? 
DORY 
You mean like a party? 
BRUCE Yeah, yeah, that's right--a party! What do you say? 
DORY Ooh, I love parties! Parties are fun! 
MARLIN Parties are fun, and it's tempting but-- 
DORY Whew! I'm glad I got that off my chest. 
BRUCE All right, anyone else? Hello, how 'bout you, mate? What's your problem? 
MARLIN Me? I don't have a problem. 
BRUCE Oh. Okay.. 
BRUCE/ANCHOR/CHUM Denial. 
BRUCE Just start with your name. 
MARLIN Okay. Uh, hello. My name is Marlin. I'm a clownfish-- 
CHUM A clownfish? Really?! 
BRUCE Go on, tell us a joke! 
CHUM Ooh! I love jokes! 
MARLIN Actually I do know one that's pretty good. There was this mollusk and he walks up to a sea cucumber. Normally, they don't talk, sea cucumbers, but in a joke, everyone talks. So the sea mollusk says to the cucumber... 
NEMO Daddy! 
MARLIN Nemo! 
CHUM Nemo! Ha ha ha! Nemo! I don't get it. 
BRUCE For a clownfish, he's not that funny. 
MARLIN No, no, no, no. He's my son. He was taken by these divers. 
DORY Oh my, you poor fish. 
CHUM Humans. Think they own everything. 
ANCHOR Probably American. 
BRUCE Now there is a father looking for his little boy. 
MARLIN Ugh! What do these markings mean? 
BRUCE I never knew my father! [sobs] 
CHUM Aw, come here. 
ANCHOR Group hug. 
CHUM We're all mates here, mate. 
MARLIN I can't read human. 
DORY Well then we gotta find a fish who can read this. Hey, look. Sharks! 
MARLIN No, no, no, Dory! 
DORY Guys, guys! 
MARLIN No, Dory! 
DORY That's mine! Give it to me! Gimme! Oww! 
MARLIN Oh, I'm sorry. Are you okay? 
DORY Ow, ow, ow. 
MARLIN I'm so sorry. 
DORY You really clocked me there. Am I bleeding? 
MARLIN Ohh... 
BRUCE What? [gasps] Swim away! Swim away! 
DORY Aw, is the party over? 
PELICAN Nice. 
NEMO Dad? Daddy? 
DENTIST Barbara? 
BARBARA Uh-huh? 
DENTIST Prep for his anterior crown, would you, please? And I'm going to need a few cotton rolls. 
BARBARA Okay. 
DENTIST Hello, little fella! 
NEMO Aah!

BUBBLES Wow. The big blue. What's it like? 
GURGLE The dentist took him off the reef. 
NIGEL An outie. From my neck of the woods, eh? Sorry if I ever took a snap at you. Fish gotta swim, birds gotta eat. [gasps] 
DENTIST Hey! No, no,   no, no! They're not your fish. They're my fish. Come on, go! Go on, shoo! Oh, the picture   broke. This here's Darla. She's my niece. She's going to be eight next week. Hey, little   fella. Say hello to your new mummy. She'll be here Friday to pick you up. You're her present.   Shh, shh, shh! It's our little secret. Well, Mr. Tucker, while that sets up I'm going to   see a man about a wallaby. 
BLOAT Oh, Darla. 
NEMO What? What's wrong with her? 
GURGLE She wouldn't stop shaking the bag. 
BUBBLES Poor Chuckles. 
DEB He was her present last year. 
BLOAT Hitched a ride on the porcelain express. 
PEACH She's a fish killer. 
NEMO I can't go with that girl! I have to get back to my dad! Aaah! Daddy! Help me! 
GURGLE Oh, he's stuck! 
GILL 
Nobody touch him! Nobody touch him. 
NEMO Can you help me? 
GILL No. You got yourself in there, you can get yourself out. 
PEACH Gill..

DORY Okay, I can't see a thing. 
MARLIN Oh, gee! 
DORY Hey, look! A mask! 
MARLIN Read it! 
DORY I'm sorry, but if you could just bring it a little closer, I kind of need the light. That's great, keep it right there. 
MARLIN Just read it! 
DORY Okay, okay. Mr. Bossy. Uh, 'P'. Okay, 'P'. 'Shh-eer...Sher--P. Sher--P. Shirley? P.--'. Oh! The first line's 'P. Sherman'!

GILL You miss your dad, don't you, Sharkbait? 
NEMO Yeah. 
GILL Well, you're lucky to have someone out there who's lookin' for you. 
NEMO He's not looking for me. He's scared of the ocean. 
GILL Peach, any movement? 
PEACH He's had at least four cups of coffee, it's gotta be soon. 
GILL Keep on him. 
GILL My first escape, landed on dental tools. I was aimin' for the toilet. 
NEMO Toilet? 
GILL All drains lead to the ocean, kid. 
NEMO Wow. How many times have you tried to get out? 
GILL Aah, I've lost count. Fish aren't meant to be in a box, kid. It does things to 'ya. 
BUBBLES Bubbles! Bubbles, bubbles, bubbles--- 
PEACH Potty break! Potty break! He just grabbed the Reader's Digest! We have 4.2 minutes. 
GILL That's your cue, Sharkbait. 
BLOAT You can do it, kid. 
GILL Okay, you gotta be quick. Once you get in, you swim down to the bottom of the chamber and I'll talk you through the rest. 
NEMO Okay. 
GILL Go on, it'll be a piece of kelp. 
NEMO [takes a deep breath] 
GILL Nicely done! Can you hear me? 
NEMO Yeah. 
GILL Here comes the pebble. Now, do you see a small opening? 
NEMO Uh-huh. 
GILL Okay, inside it you'll see a rotating fan. Very carefully, wedge that pebble into the fan to stop it turning. 
NEMO Aaah! 
GILL Careful, Sharkbait. 
NEMO I can't do it! 
PEACH Gill, this isn't a good idea. 
GILL He'll be fine. Try again. 
NEMO Okay. 
GILL That's it, Sharkbait. Nice and steady.

DORY [singing] Just keep swimming, just keep swimming. 
MARLIN Dory? 
MARLIN Boy, this is taking a while. 
DORY Hey, how about we play a game? 
MARLIN Are you sure you speak whale? 
DORY CAN-YOOOOOOOUUU-GIIIIIIIIIVE-USSSS-DIRECTIOOOOOOOONS-TOOOOOOOOO... 
MARLIN Dory! Heaven knows what you're saying! See, he's swimming away. 
DORY COOOME-BAAAAAAAAAAAAAACK! 
MARLIN He's not coming back. You offended him. 
DORY Maybe a different dialect. MOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! MOOOOOAAAAAAAAAA..! 
MARLIN Dory. Dory, this is not whale. You're speaking like..upset stomach. 
DORY Maybe I should try humpback. 
MARLIN No, don't try humpback. 
DORY WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAOOOOOOO!!! WAAAAAAAAAOOOOOO!!! 
MARLIN Okay, you actually sound sick. 
DORY Maybe louder, huh? RAAAH!!! RAAAAH!!! 
MARLIN Don't do that! 
DORY Too much orca. Didn't it sound a little orca-ish? 
MARLIN It doesn't sound orca! It sounds like nothing I've ever heard! 
DORY MOOOO..MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!! 
MARLIN It's just as well, he might be hungry. 
DORY Don't worry. Whales don't eat clownfish, they eat krill. 
KRILL 
Swim away! 
DORY Oh, look. Krill. 
MARLIN Move, Dory! Move! 
DORY Aah-aaah! Aaaaaaaaaah! 
GILL Look at that. Would you look at that? Filthy. Absolutely filthy. And it's all thanks to you, kid. You made it possible. Jacques, I said no cleaning! 
JACQUES I am ashamed. 
PEACH Hey, look. Scum angel. 
GURGLE Aah! Aaaah! Ooh-ooh! Aaaaah! 
BUBBLES Bubbles! I love the bubbles--! [coughs] 
DEB Flo! Flo! Has anybody seen Flo? Flo! 
PEACH Nine o' clock and cue dentist. 
DENTIST Hello, Barbara. Sorry I'm late. 
PEACH Okay. Okay, here we go. Here we go, okay. 
DENTIST Little Davey Reynolds. 
PEACH Okay. Walks to the counter, drops the keys.. 
GURGLE Bloat, that's disgusting! 
BLOAT Tastes pretty good to me. [belch] 
DORY I think he says we've stopped. 
MARLIN Of course, we've stopped. Just stop trying to speak whale, you're gonna make things worse. [gasps] What is that noise? Oh no. Look what you did. The water's going down! It's-it's-it's going down! 
DORY Really? You sure about that? 
MARLIN Look, it's already half-empty! 
DORY Hmm..I'd say it's half full. 
MARLIN Stop that! It's half-empty! 
DORY Okay, that one was a little tougher. He either said we should go to the back of the throat or he wants a root beer float. 
MARLIN Of course he wants us to go there! That's eating us! How do I taste, Moby!? Huh!? Do I taste good!? You tell him I'm not interested in being lunch! 
DORY Okay. HEEEEEEEEE-- 
MARLIN Stop talking to him--waaaah! 
DORY Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!! 
MARLIN What is going on!? 
DORY I'll check! WHAAAAAAA--! 
MARLIN No! No more whale! You can't speak whale! 
DORY Yes, I can! 
MARLIN No, you can't! You think you could do these things but you can't, Nemo! 
DORY Okay. 
MARLIN Dory!

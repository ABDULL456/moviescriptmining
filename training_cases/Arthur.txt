ARTHUR 
Written by 
Peter Baynham 
EXT. MANHATTAN - NIGHT 
A HOMELESS MAN, who from his tatty suit may have been a top broker this time last year, is picking through a bin in Manhattan's deserted night-time financial district. 
The street starts to vibrate. A TERRIFYING GROWL approaches. 
A huge black shape smashes into view - THE DARK KNIGHT'S BATMOBILE! Our audience wonder if they've wandered into the wrong movie. The Homeless Man dives for cover. 
BAM! The Batmobile smashes into a row of parked cars. 
We hear manic laughing from inside the car, which screeches and careers violently into a sign reading `WALL STREET'. 
Sirens herald THREE POLICE CARS in hot pursuit. 
The Batmobile roars up Wall Street, bashing against the New York Stock Exchange, thumping up and down the Federal Hall's steps and finally smashing at high speed into the rear end of the famous 'Charging Bull' statue. Two enormous bronze testicles thud onto the Batmobile's bonnet and roll away. 
The cop cars screech up, surrounding the Batmobile. TWO OLDER COPS and A ROOKIE surround it, weapons drawn. 
A HELICOPTER appears, blazing the Batmobile in white light. 
ROOKIE COP Cooool. 
An older Cop flashes the rookie a dirty look, then points a FLASHLIGHT into a tiny window. THE BATMAN - actually drunken English socialite ARTHUR BACH TEMPLEMEAD in a costume - lowers the window and offers a handshake. 
ARTHUR Evening, Constable! 
OLDER COP 1 (seen it all before) Hi, Arthur. 
ARTHUR Are you familiar with the expression `I can explain everything'? 
OLDER COP 1 Out of the car, please. 
ARTHUR Terribly sorry, but in the film they used a different model to show the old Batchap getting in and out. This one has no doors, so I'd have to squeeze out the back arsehole first. Which nobody wants... (TO COP 2) Apart from you, cheeky monkey! (BEAT) It's a joke! Okay, okay. 
Arthur wriggles awkwardly out of a rear hatch. The bronze bull teeters, a little scarily. He stands, wobbly. His Batman utility belt features a big water pistol, a firework, a hip flask and line of shot glasses. And, inexplicably, a big red stapler. The younger cop is desperately fighting the giggles. 
OLDER COP 1 Okay, explain everything. 
ARTHUR Well. What with having spunked 1.6 million fat Alberts on this little runaround, I thought why not take it a step further and try to actually collar a few ne-er do wells? It worked for the billionaire Bruce Wayne, why not the future billionaire Arthur Bach- Templemead? Will I have to do traffic school? 
OLDER COP 2 How much have you drunk, Arthur? 
ARTHUR To use the technical medical term - megabloodyshitloads. Either that or I've had a stroke! But fret not, I have a designated driver. 
The cop shines his flashlight back inside, revealing A BEARDED HOMELESS OLD MAN IN A CRAPPY 60S `ROBIN' costume. 
HOMELESS ROBIN Where's my five thousand dollars? 
Arthur counts out a huge wad of cash. 
ARTHUR The Boy Homeless here neglected to say he'd never driven. (MORE) 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) Or that the only reason he's sober is to be ready for the conspiracy of leopards about to seize Manhattan. 
HOMELESS ROBIN It's LIZARDS! English prick! 
Arthur hands another wad of cash to Cop 1. 
ARTHUR I trust this will cover all repairs to New York and any inconvenience to your good selves? 
He turns and tries to get back in. 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) Up up and away! Ah, no, that's the other chap. 
The bronze bull collapses fully, crushing the Batmobile. 
INT. 23RD PRECINCT. CELL - NIGHT - LATER 
Arthur sits, minus mask, in a cell with Homeless Robin and VARIOUS CRIMINALS and DRUNKS, including A HUGE GUY IN A CHICAGO CUBS SHIRT, sporting a terrifically swollen eye. 
JAY, a drunk with a bandaged neck, is ranting away at Arthur, who's paying close attention, genuinely fascinated. Cash sticks out of various pockets. 
JAY Then the crazy motherfucker cut me! 
ARTHUR Goodness. Why? 
Like the pied piper, Arthur leads his disciples into the bar. 
JUMP CUT TO: 
EXT. BAR - LATER 
Arthur staggers out, leading a bigger crowd! (IN A CONGA?) He's even more drunk, arm in arm with Carmella the prostitute and a very attractive young woman, SOFIA. He produces A BIG ROCKET. 
ARTHUR Stand back! 
He releases the firework; it flies at a crazy drunk angle, people screaming and diving for cover. It explodes into a shop sign reading `CHECKS CASHED'. 
CARMELLA (LAUGHING) Oh, man. Nobody tell you about the recession? 
ARTHUR The what? 
EXT. MANHATTAN - NIGHT 
A very long line of excited people stand at an ATM, Arthur at the front. 
ARTHUR Roll up, roll up, folks, let's fix this thing right now. (to his first customer) How much, sir? 
FIRST MAN Um. $800 please. 
ARTHUR Coming right up. (keys it in) Fries with that? 
The man laughs, along with others in the line, including Sofia who catches his eye. 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) Congratulations everyone! THE RECESSION'S OVER! 
Arthur dials a number on his gold iPhone. 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) Pierre? Arthur Bach-Templemead. Can you squeeze me in for a little snack? Yeah, just me and a couple of mates. 
INT. FANCY RESTAURANT - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 
The Maitre D' enters from the kitchen and is stunned to find the restaurant incredibly stuffed with people, so there's standing room only. People are even sitting on tables. It's a very eclectic mix of people. 
An angry, stuffy old man and his wife and daughter sit horrified at the center. 
Arthur's flanked by Carmella the prostitute and Sofia from the ATM line. 
ARTHUR Pierre! We'd like 182 pate de foie gras, 182 chateaubriand steaks, a motherlode of chips and your entire wine cellar please. 
The daughter of the stuffy couple - she's ERICA - speaks. 
ERICA Arthur? 
ARTHUR (TAKEN ABACK) Erica? Fancy meeting you here! Er...Everybody, this is Erica - the very best friend forever of my girlfriend Susan. And Erica's parents Ernest and Margaret. (to Erica and her parents) Are you familiar with the expression `I can't explain anything'? 
ERICA Who are the women with you, Arthur? 
ARTHUR Oh, um, this is Sofia. I believe she works for Avis. Checks the cars for dings, dead people in the trunk, that sort of thing. And this is Carmella. Anyway... 
ERICA'S FATHER What do you do, Carmella? 
CARMELLA Whatever you want. But no penetration without a rubber. 
It's all gone a bit tense. 
ARTHUR Carmella's joking. She's actually a...queen. Of a very small country. 
ERICA'S FATHER Is she now? 
ARTHUR It's terribly small. 
ERICA'S FATHER I see. 
ARTHUR Rhode Island could beat the crap out of it in a war. 
ERICA'S FATHER Yes, it's a small place. 
ARTHUR 85 cents in a cab from one end of the country to the other. I'm talking small. 
ERICA'S FATHER I think I understand how small it is. 
ARTHUR Just had the entire country carpeted, this is not a big place. 
ERICA'S FATHER You need to grow up, Arthur. 
ARTHUR That's easy for you to say, you haven't got 50 pairs of short trousers hanging in your closet. Maybe we should go somewhere else. 
NAOMI (CONT'D) That was a joke, folks. It was built for the Chrysler corporation. 
Naomi shares an eye roll with A NEWSSTAND GUY who's clearly in love with her. 
NAOMI (CONT'D) The spire is a beauty, especially on a winter's morning when the sun hits it and it just seems to... 
GRUMPY FEMALE TOURIST (INTERRUPTING) How tall is it? 
NAOMI 1047 feet madam, not allowing for pigeon shit. Okay, let's cross. 
Naomi leads the tourists across the busy road. She has to go back to grab a teenager in the headphones, who didn't hear. Arthur hurries alongside Naomi. 
ARTHUR Can I join your tour please? 
NAOMI Sure. It's $15, plus $5 for the free authentic street pretzel. Sorry, my bosses make the prices. 
Arthur produces his wallet full of high-end credit cards. 
NAOMI (CONT'D) Sorry. I can't take cards. (BEAT) Ah, owe me it. I start on that corner every day on the hour... 
Just as Naomi's reaching the other side, a cabbie, driving very aggressively, nearly hits her. 
NAOMI (CONT'D) Hey, you big blind jerk! Doesn't your braille windshield work? 
CABBIE (ANGRY) !NO ME HINCHAN LAS PELOTAS! 
NAOMI PEGUELO ENCIMA DE SU ASNO, USTED PINCHAZO GRANDE SU MADRE ES UN PUTA ENORMA Y SU PADRE NO TIENE NINGUIN MARTILLO! 
The cabbie's shocked - but laughs and blows Naomi a kiss. She smiles back. 
ARTHUR Wow. What did you say? 
NAOMI Just generalised criticism of his parents and genitals. (to the tourists) Everyone make it over alive? Excellent. Next we enter Times Square, world famous for New Year's Eve, when a Waterford Crystal Ball descends at eye-poppingly slow speed for the inexplicable entertainment of a million drunk fools. Many people think the square is actually a square, despite blatant evidence otherwise. (TO ARTHUR) Sir? What shape is Times Square? 
ARTHUR A circle? 
NAOMI (LAUGHS) See? Morons. 
More tourists laugh this time. Some... 
GRUMPY MALE TOURIST When do we get the pretzel? 
NAOMI Soon, sir. Soon. 
She checks her watch and leads the party inside a laundromat. 
NAOMI (CONT'D) Okay, next the very Laundromat once used by George Gershwin, Donald Trump... 
INT. LAUNDROMAT - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 
Naomi approaches a washing machine just as it ends its cycle and makes a loud buzz. 
NAOMI ...Mr Big from Sex and the City and three of the 9-11 terrorists. 
She starts unloading the machine of a large man's whites - vests, underwear, shirts, all stained red by a baseball cap. 
NAOMI (CONT'D) Oh, dad. 
She transfers the laundry into a tumble dryer and feeds it quarters. Arthur stays close. 
NAOMI (CONT'D) The Welsh poet Dylan Thomas drank himself to death at the Chelsea Hotel half an hour after losing a sock in this very dryer. 
ARTHUR (CONSPIRATORIAL) Are you abusing this tour to do your errands? 
NAOMI Are you abusing the tour to stalk me? 
ARTHUR Absolutely. 
Arthur stares at the big tumble dryers. 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) These things are amazing. Have you ever put all your father's clothes on and just got inside one? 
Naomi looks at him, bemused but intrigued as she heads to the door. 
EXT. TIMES SQUARE - DAY 
Hobson's out of the car looking for Arthur. 
HOBSON Where the blazes is that boy? Arthur! 
EXT. STREET - DAY - CONTINUOUS 
INT. TEMPLEMEAD HOLDINGS - DAY - CONTINUOUS 
They cross a huge foyer, passing a big sign reading `TEMPLEMEAD HOLDINGS INC' to the elevator. 
ARTHUR But what if this is the one? 
HOBSON This is just like the Komodo dragon. Everyone else is happy to see one in the zoo and leave it there. You had to own one. Thank goodness that handbag manufacturer was prepared to take the poor lizard away. 
ARTHUR (HORRIFIED) You said he's in London Zoo! 
HOBSON He is, Arthur. Are you the only one allowed to joke now? 
INT. TEMPLEMEAD HOLDINGS. RECEPTION AREA - DAY 
Reception is manned by GRANT, a too-cool-for-school, young Aryan beefcake straight out of an Abercrombie & Fitch spread. Arthur and Hobson enter. 
ARTHUR I don't like it here. 
HOBSON Of course you don't. People work here. 
GRANT (HATES ARTHUR) Good afternoon, Mr Bach-Templemead. 
ARTHUR Hi Grant. Tell me - which of your parents are you most like? Abercrombie or Fitch? 
GRANT (doesn't get the joke) I have no connection with that store. My family name is Von Krausehoff. Take a seat please. 
Arthur and Hobson sit down. Grant picks up a phone. 
GRANT (CONT'D) Vivienne? (conspiratorial, flirty) White mid-rise briefs...mmmm. 
HOBSON Don't fret, Arthur. This won't take long. Then we'll have ice cream. 
A LARGE OFFICE DOOR opens spookily of its own accord. 
VIVIENNE (O.S.) Come in, Arthur. 
Arthur heads to the door. VIVIENNE BACH-TEMPLEMEAD a formidable, tanned American widow in her sixties, shakes his hand. 
VIVIENNE (CONT'D) Arthur. 
ARTHUR Vivienne. 
VIVIENNE You know I prefer `mother'. 
ARTHUR I'm sorry. You look more like a Vivienne. 
Vivienne nods to Hobson as the door to her lair shuts. An icy breeze passes between biological mother and surrogate. 
INT. VIVIENNE'S OFFICE - DAY - CONTINUOUS 
The office boasts many glass cases full of trophies and framed photos of Vivienne's younger self showjumping and holding trophies aloft. There's one small photo of Vivienne, Arthur's late father GERALD and Arthur as a toddler. 
Vivienne's engrossed in a document, making notations. Arthur, clearly uncomfortable here, sits in a low sofa before her. 
VIVIENNE (not looking up) So. How are you, Arthur? 
ARTHUR Quite busy. I have a riding boot shoot for Petrie Dressage... 
But Vivienne's buried in her work, not listening. 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) What else...I'm meeting Ivanka Trump for brunch to discuss the environment. She's sending her helicopter to avoid the traffic... 
Vivienne's still not listening. 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) Crashed my Batmobile into the bronze bull on Wall Street... 
She's still not listening. Has it always been like this? 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) ...which caused a hole to swallow up the New York Stock Exchange... 
She's still not listening. 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) ..the world economy to collapse and the planet to descend into looting and cannibalism. 
Still not listening. 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) What else? Um...tripped over in the shower this morning. Head split open, found a family of meerkats hiding in there! Hated the thought of the little lads being homeless so I bricked up the remaining half of my brain, popped them back in and Hobson glued my skull back together. 
Still not listening. 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) I'm thinking of buying a giant. I think the market's right for it. 
INT. ARTHUR'S APARTMENT - DAY 
The liberated lobsters are now living happily at the bottom of the London phone box aquarium. Arthur eats lunch alone at a huge table, THE BIGGEST DIAMOND RING IN THE WORLD is beside him. Hobson brings a plate of vitamins. 
HOBSON Ah. The ring your father gave your mother, I recall. 
ARTHUR (feeling its huge weight) Did he knock her out with it, then drive her to the church in the trunk of his Bentley? 
HOBSON No. Your father was a gentleman. 
ARTHUR What's gentlemanly about dying before I knew him? That's just rude. Did he ever love my mother? 
HOBSON They had their days. 
ARTHUR Ah well. At least he doesn't have to wake up every day to a woman with a face like saran wrap stretched over a gargoyle. 
Arthur stares at the ring again. 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) What about Naomi? 
HOBSON Arthur. I say this with love: 
ARTHUR Uh-oh... 
HOBSON Even by modern male standards you're a breathtakingly immature little shit. Coupled with the kind of money you have access to, that's deadly. Susan may not have a four hour stand up routine about the Flatiron Building, but she's a solid girl who will look after you. 
ARTHUR I have you for that. 
HOBSON Not forever. 
ARTHUR Yes forever. You're Hobson. 
INT. NAOMI'S APARTMENT - DAY - CONTINUOUS 
Naomi answers a giant old cellphone in her modest apartment, cooking for her dad, RALPH, a bear of a man slumped in front of the TV watching CSI. A picture of Naomi and her elderly mother, in hospital, is on the wall. 
NAOMI Hello? (SILENCE) Hello? 
ARTHUR (O.S, ON PHONE) (MOCK SINISTER) This is your English stalker. 
NAOMI (UNFAZED) Oh, hi! What's up? 
ARTHUR I'm sorry, I've never really understood that question. Are you free tomorrow night? 
NAOMI Sorry, I'm polishing my yacht. 
INT. ARTHUR'S APARTMENT - DAY - CONTINUOUS 
Arthur's on the toilet in a bathroom whose walls are entirely covered in a photographic mural to make it look like he's sitting at the top of a ski slope, with skis on his feet. 
ARTHUR Is that a euphemism for something naughty? 
NAOMI No, it's a lie. I have a creative writing class. Tonight? 
Arthur glances down at the ring box on the floor. 
ARTHUR I have a contractual commitment. Friday? 
NAOMI You got it. 
ARTHUR Paper. 
NAOMI Sorry? 
A voice-activated toilet paper dispenser spits out a sheet. 
ARTHUR Sorry, I was talking to something else. So. What do you want to do? 
INT. NAOMI'S APARTMENT. DAY - CONTINUOUS 
Naomi dishes out the food on cheap plates. It's all a big contrast to Arthur's setting. 
NAOMI A movie? 
ARTHUR Movie? Come on, you've got to try harder than that. 
NAOMI Pizza. 
ARTHUR What have you always wanted to do? 
NAOMI It's a first date, Arthur. Not our honeymoon. 
ARTHUR You don't, um, have anything stronger, do you? 
BURT Sparkling. 
Arthur laughs nervously. But Burt's not joking. 
BURT (CONT'D) `The drunkard and the glutton shalt come to poverty: and drowsiness shalt clothe a man with rags.' 
ARTHUR Surely a glass of sherry at Christmas? 
Burt clinks glasses with him. 
BURT Peace be with you. 
ARTHUR And also with me. 
He sees Jesus's head! It's sitting on top of one of the blades of the ceiling fan! 
BURT Arthur. Can I be honest with you? 
ARTHUR You're the real Slim Shady? I knew it! 
BURT My faith teaches me to hate the sin, not the sinner. But with you, I struggle with that belief. 
Burt turns away to get a glass of water. 
ARTHUR You could switch to Judaism. (glances up at the fan) Bit warm in here. Do you mind if I put the fan on? 
Arthur turns the fan on a low setting. It rotates slowly, the head going around with it. Burt turns away to pour more water. Arthur grabs the moment to speed up the fan again, until it's going fast enough and Jesus's head falls off. Arthur catches it. Arthur gets behind Burt, out of sight temporarily. 
BURT Anyway, Arthur. However I feel about you, my daughter loves you. 
ARTHUR Yes, it's a problem, isn't it? 
Arthur reaches out and, unseen by Burt, he reaches out of shot and puts the head back on Jesus's body. 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) Let's knock our heads together and find a way to stop her loving me....Got it! We'll tell her I'm on the sex offenders register....No, I am and she knows. (BEAT) Joke, sorry. Ah. We'll say I'm gay! I did once dabble actually, so I can tell a plausible story. 
BURT You made love to a guy? 
ARTHUR One Moslem doesn't make a mosque, Burt. 
BURT You made love to a Moslem? 
ARTHUR No, sir, it was Prince Alois of Lichtenstein and he made love to me. The fact that it took three bottles of poppers and a Jacuzzi full of Krug to loosen me up confirmed my heterosexuality. 
Arthur notices that Jesus's head is on backwards. 
Burt picks up a Bible from his desk and quotes from memory. 
BURT `If there is a man who lies with a male, they shall surely be put to death.' 
ARTHUR Crikey. Couldn't there just be some kind of on-the-spot fine? 
Burt really hammers the table this time. 
BURT You will stop this talk and marry - my - fucking... 
Jesus's head falls off. Arthur peers around. It's nowhere! 
ARTHUR Oh bollocks. 
Both Arthur and Burt see Jesus's head at the bottom of the fish tank. It floats back up to the top. 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) It's a miracle! He is risen! 
But SUSAN, Burt's beautiful daughter, enters with her best friend Erica - who Arthur met whilst at the restaurant the other night. 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) Hi Susan. Erica. 
Burt looks from Jesus's head to the sword, figuring it out. 
SUSAN Sorry to make you wait, Arthur. I was talking to your mother. I hear you have something to ask me! 
Arthur feels Burt's smiling face - and hating eyes - on him. 
ARTHUR Shall we go? 
INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
A VERY PRECISE FRENCH WAITER performs the specials menu with ludicrous elan. Susan is rapt, taking it all very seriously. 
At table level, Susan waits, irritated. 
ARTHUR (O.S.) All done. 
Susan pulls her hand up, and gazes at the huge, glinting diamond - pushed onto the end of her thumb. 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) Susan. Would you marry me? Take the weekend if you want... 
SUSAN Yes, I'll marry you. 
She nods imperceptibly at the waiter. 
WAITER Ladies and gentleman - the happy couple! 
Music starts. A congratulatory round of applause. Confetti is thrown. The whole restaurant cheers. Susan whips out her Blackberry and starts hitting keys. 
SUSAN Erica will be the planner. 
ARTHUR Erica? She hates me. 
SUSAN Who I love, she loves. 
ARTHUR Oh, come on. She always looks like she wants to set fire to my face then put it out with an Uzi. 
Susan's phone rings. 
SUSAN (ANSWERING) Hello...thanks, daddy! Sorry, hang on, I have Erica calling... 
ARTHUR What's going on? I only just bloody proposed! 
Arthur's phone rings. The caller I.D reads `Vivienne'. He kills the call and sits, horrified, as the entire restaurant celebrates his grim fate. 
INT. PIERRE HOTEL BASEMENT GARAGE - NIGHT - LATER 
In the gloom we track past the crushed Batmobile, the Delorean and other famous cars, to find Arthur sitting in KITT from `Knight Rider'. 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) What have I done, Kitt? This mistake's up there with Hitler joining his school debating team... 
VOICE (FEMALE) Go to bed, Arthur. 
Arthur jumps out of his skin. But it's Hobson, standing by the car holding a dressing gown and a mug of cocoa. 
HOBSON And stop this self-pitying bibble. You're going to be fabulously rich. 
ARTHUR Maybe I'd rather be fabulously poor. Some poor people I see look happy. 
HOBSON That's either because they're far away or you've just given them money. Arthur, poor people have to work. They stand for hours in the rain, waiting for buses full of other poor people to take them to things called `jobs' which they do all year round to pay for holidays away from those jobs. 
ARTHUR Don't patronise me. I have a job. 
HOBSON Lying drunk on a bale of hay in riding boots being photographed by another pampered prick won't prepare you for the work I mean. And I don't want to see you suffer. Take your fish oil. 
INT. NAOMI'S APARTMENT, QUEENS - NIGHT 
A very old Apple Mac sits on a cluttered desk. 
Ralph is in his chair, eating Popeye's Chicken n' Biscuits, watching CSI on an old TV with a tiny satellite dish on top. 
RALPH When are we getting cable? 
NAOMI (O.S.) We have satellite. 
RALPH Honey, that's some bullshit aerial from the 99 cent Store! 
NAOMI It's a satellite dish! 
RALPH I read the box! It said `No satellite fees to pay because does not receive satellite signals!' That's like saying `Hey - eat this plate of broken glass! It won't make you fat. 'cause IT'S GLASS!' 
Naomi comes in, looking absolutely beautiful. She checks her hair in the mirror. 
NAOMI It's better than nothing. 
Ralph unplugs the dish. The picture improves. 
RALPH No it ain't. Honey, I love you, but you're even cheaper than your mom. And she bought food from yard sales. 
NAOMI I miss her too, daddy. But now she's gone and if I'm going to keep you in grits and Oprah the rest of your life, you live by my rules. 
RALPH But you live like you're preparing for a war. And you earn a decent salary. 
NAOMI So? I want to know I can look after you. 
NAOMI `It doesn't remotely matter how much or what you spend it on' rich? 
Arthur shrugs and swigs champagne, pouring more. 
NAOMI (CONT'D) Craziest thing you ever bought? 
ARTHUR I once inadvertently financed a terrorist cell who said they needed £100,000 to open a falafel stall. 
She laughs. She stops laughing. 
NAOMI Oh my G-d, you're serious. 
ARTHUR What's the craziest thing you ever told a tour party? 
NAOMI I once said the Manhattan we were in was actually a movie set built for `You've got Mail', but that after the film wrapped, everyone moved to the set because there was less crime. 
A sudden, very loud, very out-of-date ring tone. Naomi takes out a huge ancient Motorola phone. 
NAOMI (CONT'D) Yes, dad? There's a small Tiffany butter knife about two inches from his hand but it might take him eight months to dismember me with it. (PHONE BLEEPS) Gotta go, battery. Love you too. 
She ends the call. 
NAOMI (CONT'D) Mom died last year. For eight months dad ate nothing but Popeye's Chicken n' Biscuits in front of CSI. So I persuaded him to move in with me. Where he eats Popeye's Chicken n' Biscuits in front of CSI. 
ARTHUR Sounds like you're very good to him. 
NAOMI What are you gonna do? All those years your folks tucked you in, did their best to stop you from eating crap in front of the TV. And then one day, you're the one saying `No, honey, it's bad for you! Go to bed.' Weird, huh? 
ARTHUR (not relating at all) Yeah. I hate that. (looks at her phone) Nice bit of kitsch. Where did you find that? 
NAOMI AT&T store in 1998. 
ARTHUR It's...You've had it twelve years? 
NAOMI It's a fine phone. Battery life of eleven seconds, which cuts the crap right out of conversations. 
Something weird is happening. The world wobbles imperceptibly as the background drops away. She hasn't noticed yet. 
NAOMI (CONT'D) I can't believe these mofos who gotta keep up with the latest bullshit. CDs come along, so out with the vinyl. Vinyl's back in, out with the CDs. I just kept the vinyl. Way cheaper, and I get to be incredibly hip once every 20 years.... 
A beat. She looks around. And down. 
NAOMI (CONT'D) WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON? 
Cutting wide, we see that the picnic was taking place on a grass covered platform with a tree planted in it - which is being lifted off the ground by a crane! 
ARTHUR I couldn't decide between picnic in the park and dinner with a view. So it's a picnic in the sky! Isn't it ace? 
The whole thing is rising higher and higher and higher. 
NAOMI No it is not ace, you crazy English bastard! This is dangerous! 
ARTHUR Oh, sorry. Forgot. They said to put these on. 
He pulls back the blanket to reveal seat belts. He straps her in. 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) (LAUGHING) Naomi, it's okay! It's very safe. It's this company called `Aerial Delights'. They specialise in catering unusual events at a height of 180 feet above the ground. 
A gust of wind blows the structure, which swings. Naomi screams. 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) So what got you into the walking tours? 
NAOMI You're seriously making date small talk while this is going on? 
ARTHUR Be still. Breathe deep. (strikes a Zen pose) `When you can be calm in the midst of activity, this is the true state of nature': Huanchu Daoeren. 
NAOMI `Lower this freak show to the ground and get me a cab': Naomi Snart. 
ARTHUR (handing her something) Taste this truffle. 
Naomi tastes it. It's clearly delicious. She gazes around as the crane swings them out over the Hudson. The view of Manhattan, of the river, of the Statue of Liberty, is mind bogglingly gorgeous from up here. 
Naomi bursts out laughing. She sips champagne. 
NAOMI What the hell. Gotta go sometime, right? At least it won't be years of pain like mom. Just a few seconds of screaming and falling with a truffle in my mouth. 
ARTHUR So anyway. The tours... 
NAOMI (CALMING HERSELF) Okay, okay. Be deep. Breathe still. The tours are a temporary nine year fill-in until I'm drowned in a tsunami of apologies from everyone who failed to recognise my writing genius first time round. 
ARTHUR What did you write? 
ERICA Don't worry, Thomas. This whole thing's just a joke to Arthur. 
Hobson brings Arthur a glass of water and two Nurofen. 
ARTHUR (VERY AFFECTIONATE) Thanks, Hobnobs. You are good to me. 
Vivienne, irritated, hands Hobson a coffee cup. 
VIVIENNE Take this away. (TO ERICA) Progress on the reception? 
ERICA Black inked at the Emery Roth Room at the Ritz-Carlton. 
The screen lights up with a church graphic. 
ERICA (CONT'D) A first pass at the guest list. Bride's family and friends: 
A 3-d layout of the church appears on a laptop. In the mock up, the bride's side of the aisle fills with hundreds of computerised guests, many labelled with famous names. 
ERICA (CONT'D) Groom's family and friends: 
About a fifth of that number pop up on Arthur's side. 
ERICA (CONT'D) We can arrange to screen off the area behind your guests, Arthur. To make it seem less desperate. 
Arthur groans and leans over a bowl. 
ARTHUR Sorry, everyone. that graphic's too colourful and this hangover's a 7.6 on the Richter..the Sickter... 
Arthur's sick. Erica lays out more sheets. 
ERICA Cakes, caterers, floral arrangements, photographer... 
Hobson reappears, wipes his mouth and takes the bowl. She stands with it accidentally-on-purpose, very close to Vivienne's nose. 
HOBSON Will there be anything else, sir? 
ARTHUR No, thanks. 
HOBSON (TO VIVIENNE) Ma'am? 
VIVIENNE No. You can leave. 
ARTHUR Why all this crap now? What's the rush anyway? 
BURT The wedding is in a month, Arthur. 
ARTHUR A month? I was thinking more sort of ten, fifteen years. Just to really enjoy the anticipation of the big day. 
Arthur gets up. 
ERICA Where are you going? 
ARTHUR (gets out his cellphone) Sorry, Dwight D. Bridalshower, Operation Ball and Chain will have to wait. 
EXT. MANHATTAN - DAY 
Arthur is walking Naomi along the Hudson, this time in daylight. He stops. 
ARTHUR Here we are. 
NAOMI We're not going to end up in the Hudson again, are we? 
ARTHUR I can promise you won't get wet. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. HUDSON RIVER - NIGHT 
The Hudson is bare of craft....until, suddenly, a bizarre mini submarine shaped like a dolphin, dives out of the water in an arc. Arthur and Naomi are laughing inside it - until they almost collide with a Circle Tour boat full of tourists. 
EXT. MANHATTAN - NIGHT 
Arthur and Naomi are hand in hand, walking along the street. He's a bit drunk, wobbly on his feet, a little morose. 
NAOMI Are you okay? 
ARTHUR Yeah, fine. Actually... 
But Naomi sees something on the other side of the road. 
Arthur gets a a text from Hobson: `TELL her!' 
He slips her a dollar and whispers to her. 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) Quick, before someone gets it. 
Naomi gazes at a different Arthur to the fool who nearly got her killed. 
OLD WOMAN (TO NAOMI) You got a good one here, honey. 
She hurries away. 
ARTHUR Look. Us in a year's time. 
ANOTHER OLD COUPLE push a cart past. THE OLD WOMAN sneezes. The old man produces a tissue and gently wipes her nose. 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) If you got ill, I'd care for you. 
NAOMI I'll get ill. 
The music changes. 
NAOMI (CONT'D) Oh, man, Phil Collins. Gotta get out when they start playing Phil Collins. Want to see how to get a quarter from a shopping cart? 
INT. HIGH END RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
Arthur, Susan and Erica - her laptop open - are at dinner. Hobson's salting Arthur's soup, then checking the temperature. 
ERICA Tiger Woods has confirmed! 
ARTHUR I didn't know you knew him. 
SUSAN I don't. 
ARTHUR Why is he coming? 
SUSAN He agreed to daddy's fee. This is going to be the happiest day of my life! 
She looks at Hobson. 
SUSAN (CONT'D) Why is she here all the time? 
ARTHUR If you can bring Erica, I can bring Hobson. 
SUSAN She's my wedding planner. 
ARTHUR She's my Hobson. 
Hobson leans into Arthur while tidying his napkin. 
HOBSON (WHISPERING) Tell Naomi. That's an order. 
INT. ARTHUR'S APARTMENT. NIGHT 
Arthur's giving stunned Naomi a tour of the huge apartment. 
ARTHUR Reminiscent of a French castle perched 500 feet above New York, the penthouse was known from early days as the `Chateau in the Sky'. 
He leads her out onto a second rooftop ballroom. 
NAOMI A second ballroom. Obviously. Gotta have a second ballroom. 
ARTHUR Where George Gershwin and the Astors danced to Shep Fields and his Rippling Rhythm Orchestra. 
He grabs her in a ballroom dance move. 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) Come on, cheap girl. We can be Fred Austere and Stingy Rogers. 
NAOMI (PULLING AWAY) I just need one of your collection of bathrooms. 
ARTHUR Behind the telephone box fish tank. See you on the balcony. 
Arthur goes onto the balcony. Naomi's notices a figure sitting in the dark, stifling a cough. Hobson. 
NAOMI Hobson? 
HOBSON He's not like other men, you know. 
NAOMI I think I realised that as I plunged into the Hudson with a junkie. But I like him. He's fun. 
Hobson fights another little cough. She gets up. 
HOBSON I know he is. That's the problem. 
ARTHUR I'd be wary, Grant. She's planning to ride you around the course next. Her last boyfriend broke his ankle jumping that ditch. Had to be destroyed on the spot. 
Vivienne canters her horse up to them. 
VIVIENNE Arthur. What's so urgent that you had to come all the way out here? 
ARTHUR I'm in love. With a woman who isn't exactly who you'd describe as Susan. She's called Naomi. 
VIVIENNE Arthur, we've been through this! 
ARTHUR Won't you at least meet her? 
VIVIENNE What family is she from? 
ARTHUR The Snarts of Detroit. 
VIVIENNE Never heard of them. 
ARTHUR No, because they're normal. She's a walking tour guide, her dad's a retired car worker. 
VIVIENNE Susan will generate quality sons, not oil-soaked car monkeys. 
ARTHUR Unbelievable! Why don't you just keep me here, pay a servant to wank me into a bottle once a day... 
VIVIENNE Arthur... 
ARTHUR ...then inject it all into a field of heiresses and see who farts out a thoroughbred first? 
VIVIENNE We need an heir! 
ARTHUR Fine! You can have one with Stevey Steroids here! Surely even your uterus has had a face lift by now. 
Arthur storms away towards the car. 
GRANT (STEPPING IN) That's enough, Arthur... 
ARTHUR None of your business, J Crew. 
GRANT You are so ungrateful to your mother. She adores you! 
VIVIENNE Arthur. Come back here. 
ARTHUR You can shove your inheritance up your horse's arse! 
Arthur jumps into the car and it pulls away. Vivienne sits shocked on her horse. But then she throws it into a gallop and catches up. 
VIVIENNE Suit yourself, Arthur. Follow your heart. But do be aware I consider what you've squandered so far an advance on your inheritance. That's about $17 million. 
ARTHUR Why would you do that? You'd never get it back. 
VIVIENNE No. But you'd spend the rest of your life in court. There's a simple solution to all this. Marry Susan. And cheat with the nobody from Queens. 
INT. DINER - DAY 
Arthur's very drunk, maudlin, sitting opposite Naomi. He's holding his menu upside down. 
NAOMI Have you been at the cookies? 
ARTHUR I ate the whole jar. 
NAOMI (realising it's serious) Oh, man. What? What? 
ARTHUR I'm engaged. To another Susan. Woman. Engaged to another woman. 
She slams her menu down. 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) I'm so sorry I didn't tell you. 
NAOMI What are you talking about? This is bullshit. Who do you think you are? Is this some rich guy thing? 
ARTHUR I was going to tell you! I just... 
Naomi gets up and puts on her coat. 
NAOMI Yeah, yeah, you just. 
ARTHUR Please, Naomi! I didn't mean for it to get to this! I planned to just be your friend but then I started to fall for you and I thought `I can't marry Susan, I might fall for Naomi!' But I thought `No I have to marry Susan or I'll be poor so I won't fall for Naomi' But then I did fall for you! Because you're brainy and funny and gorgeous and too smart to do walking tours. You're too smart, Snart. Smart Snart. There's a 99 cent cereal. (BEAT) Anyway, so I went to see Vivienne, and I said `I can't marry Susan, I love Naomi she's my Frog my Toad' I don't know any more. 
NAOMI You're frog. 
ARTHUR Thanks. Then she said `Noooo, if you don't marry Susan, I'll make you pay all the inheritance money back even if you can't - ha ha ha'. Okay she didn't laugh but she might as well have, the evil cow. Because it's like all the money ever and they'll put not just me but both of us in prison and your dad, like in Dickens. There'll be ghosts, and Oliver and.... 
NEWSSTAND GUY And even shared the tears. 
A Yellow Cab goes by, the driver lip-syncing out the window. 
NEWSSTAND GUY (CONT'D) You're the only one who really knew me at all. 
The song hits a hard club mix. Arthur bursts from the back of the van in a frog outfit! The `tourists' launch into a well- rehearsed dance. 
ARTHUR (lip syncing too) So take a look at me now, 'cause there's just an empty space. And there's nothing left here to remind me, just the memory of your face. (MORE) 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) Take a look at me now, `cause there's just an empty space, And you coming back to me is against all odds and that's what I've got to face...Just take a look at me now. 
The song builds to a dance crescendo. 
A magical moment. The crowd watches. How can she say no? 
NAOMI Sorry to be a wet blanket, folks. he's getting married. But I guess he didn't choreograph that bit for you. 
ARTHUR But..but this took ages to rehearse. I had the frog outfit specially made. These aren't actual tourists. 
NAOMI I gathered that, Arthur. Are you capable of doing anything without it being a grand gesture? 
ARTHUR What do you mean? 
NAOMI It's like Hobson said. You're not like other men. If you were normal, if the money and the booze didn't cloud everything, you'd deal with the fact that you're engaged, rather than just looking for ways to win me back. But it was a lovely routine, really. Fantastic outfit. 
ARTHUR I just wanted to see you. 
He takes out his flask and has a swig. 
NAOMI (SYMPATHETIC) You need to see someone, Arthur. Seriously. 
INT. ARTHUR'S PENTHOUSE. SHOWER - NIGHT 
Arthur's in his cuboid David Blaine shower. He picks up his binoculars. 
ARTHUR Hobson! Female Tom Hanks has had a haircut! Hobson? 
But Marty pipes up on the little inset Hobson screen. He looks at a note in Hobson's handwriting. 
MARTY It says here you shouldn't forget to clean your junk. I guess that's what...'genitahlio-ah' is. 
ARTHUR Marty? What are you doing there? 
MARTY Hobson left me in charge. She's gone to bed. She had a headache. 
ARTHUR She's had quite a few headaches lately. 
MARTY She blacked out. 
INT. HOBSON'S ROOM. DAY 
Hobson's in bed, watching a Discovery Channel documentary about grizzly bears. Arthur hits pause. 
HOBSON Put my bears back on, Arthur. 
ARTHUR Not until you answer my question. 
Hobson closes her eyes. She hams the next bit. 
HOBSON I'm travelling down a white tunnel. To - a garden? Mother? Father? Why is it so hot? Who's the red gentleman with the big pitchfork? 
ARTHUR Will you cut it out? 
HOBSON Arthur. There are three books. This is important. Take them back to the library... 
She feigns a melodramatic death. 
ARTHUR Hobson, please. Don't die any more. It's getting very boring. 
HOBSON Arthur. Old women, like bears, get sore heads. Are you okay? You look a little lost. 
ARTHUR Naomi doesn't want to see me. 
HOBSON A terrible shame she had to go. A little tart like that could have saved you a fortune in prostitutes. 
ARTHUR Listen, old woman. Don't ever talk about Naomi that way again. What gives you the right to be such a snob? You're just...you're just... Mary Poppins with a menopause! 
Arthur storms out, slamming the door. But within 10 seconds he returns, humbled, ashamed - a regretful naughty child. 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) Hobson, I've never raised my voice to you. I'm sorry. 
The car drives through Manhattan. 
INT. CAR - DAY 
Arthur stares out of the window, beaten, drunk. 
ARTHUR Thanks, Hobson. Maybe you can go every time I crave a drink? 
Hobson doesn't even crack a smile. Arthur gets out his phone and scrolls - past Naomi's name, to Susan's. He dials. 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) Susan? Look, I know the wedding date is set. But fancy bringing it forward? I just want to get it over with. In a good way. Think about it, yeah? 
He ends the call. Silence. He looks to Hobson. 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) It's the agony of possibility, Hobson. It just hurts too much to know I could still be with Naomi if I had the guts. 
HOBSON Just promise you'll never ask me to sleep with Susan for you. 
EXT. MANHATTAN - DAY 
Naomi's riding the bus. Her phone rings. `Number withheld'. She rolls her eyes and answers. 
NAOMI Arthur, if that's... (BEAT) Hello? Yes. Yes, I did...Yes. Sorry? Really? Well I worked pretty hard on it..Love to...Love to...What time? 
Incredibly excited, she grabs a pen and writes on a walking tours brochure: `JULIAN BARBER...RAINBOW PRESS...' 
NAOMI (CONT'D) I'll call in dead to work. Bye. 
She writes `TUESDAY 11.30' and an address. 
INT. NAOMI'S APARTMENT - DAY 
There's a ring at the doorbell. Ralph answers. It's Hobson. 
HOBSON Good afternoon, Mr Snart. Is Naomi here? 
RALPH You must be the nanny. 
HOBSON I must be. 
Ralph embraces her. 
HOBSON (CONT'D) Please stop this, I can't inhale and am in danger of treading on one of your knuckles. 
Ralph releases her. 
HOBSON (CONT'D) If you and your undershirt would walk two paces back I could enter this dwelling. 
Naomi appears, looking more of a writer than a tour guide. 
NAOMI Well, well. 
RALPH Ever since I met Arthur I liked him. We have to make sure these two wonderful kids stay together... 
HOBSON Try not to talk. It's not your words but the breath which bears them. Perhaps you could repair to the East Wing and make me a cup of tea? I wish to speak to Naomi. 
RALPH Sure, sure. 
Ralph leaves. 
HOBSON Arthur is having a pre-wedding party tonight. You should come. 
NAOMI Oh, should I? Are all the other girls he passed up going too? 
Hobson picks up a letter from Rainbow Press and peruses it. 
HOBSON Don't you want to show Arthur how well you're doing? 
NAOMI Tell him thanks, but I have a deadline. 
HOBSON Arthur doesn't know I'm here. He's far too decent to be involved in something so tawdry. You could bring your father. A magical experience before he's too big to leave this apartment. 
NAOMI (DISBELIEF) Why would I go to this? Why would I do that to myself? 
HOBSON My dear, if there's one thing old women can tell, it's young men in love. And the food promises to be breathtakingly free. 
Hobson has a slight dizzy spell and sits down. 
NAOMI Are you alright? 
HOBSON Better than you, dear. 
Naomi enters the party, releasing the man, who's disappointed to see her go. She looks around for Arthur, getting admiring looks from other men - and women. 
PASSING WOMAN Nice dress. Vera Wang? 
NAOMI Ross Dress For Less. You know where Arthur is? 
PASSING WOMAN (SHRUGS) Sorry. 
Naomi moves on. The Door Man appears, looking around for the gatecrasher. The man whose arm she took on the way in - he's called JUSTIN - is also on the prowl for her... 
INT. JOHNSON MANSION. BALLROOM - NIGHT 
Burt takes to the stage to applause. 
BURT When Arthur proposed to my daughter, I was overjoyous. The Bach-Templemeads are my kind of people: classy. Respectable. Well spoken. People like in Shakespeare in Love, who esprouse the same values I have always upheld both in my business and spiritual life. But tonight isn't about me or America's leading independent formula brand. 
Arthur takes the stage to wild applause. 
ARTHUR Thank you, Burt! I've actually prepared a little surprise song with my friends here. 
The band starts playing `Close To You' by the Carpenters. Arthur sings to Susan, down in the crowd. 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) Why does cash suddenly appear, every time you are near? 
The audience laugh. 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) Just like me, it longs to be, close to Sue. Why do cars fall out of the sky, all of which, I can buy... (STOPS) I'll sing a proper song. (SINGS) You say potayto and I say potahto, You say tomayto and I say tomahto, potayto, potahto, tomayto, tomahto, Let's call the whole thing off! You say AA, and I say `no way', you say `Red Bull' and I say `Go away, Rehab, No way, Red Bull... 
INT. JOHNSON MANSION - ANOTHER LARGE ROOM 
JUSTIN approaches Naomi, who's still looking around for Arthur. 
JUSTIN We meet again! 
NAOMI Yeah. Have you seen Arthur? 
JUSTIN The ballroom. I'll take you to him. 
Justin takes Naomi's arm and leads her at a leisurely pace. They pass a portrait of Susan. 
JUSTIN (CONT'D) I'm so happy for Arthur and Susan. 
Justin points at a portrait of Susan. 
JUSTIN (CONT'D) Isn't she beautiful? 
NAOMI Of course she is. Why would Arthur marry a pig? 
The Door Man appears, seeing Naomi. 
JUSTIN What business is your family in? 
NAOMI Hm? Oh, I'm the heiress to a fortune built on small pets. 
JUSTIN I'm sorry? 
NAOMI Hamsters, mice, doglets... 
JUSTIN Doglets? 
NAOMI Tiny dogs. The technology's not perfect. Seeing a horse the size of a can of soup fall dead before your eyes - that shit stays with you. 
They walk through a door, ending up in a garden. 
EXT. GARDEN - NIGHT 
NAOMI Are you sure he's this way? 
JUSTIN Absolutely. 
Naomi turns to A WOMAN. 
NAOMI (to a WOMAN) Excuse me. Have you seen Arthur? 
WOMAN That way. The ballroom. 
NAOMI Bye, Justin. 
Naomi hurries away - running straight into the Door Man. 
DOOR MAN Excuse me, madam. You're not an authorized guest. 
ARTHUR She's a writer. 
NAOMI Is this the Vivienne? 
VIVIENNE Crowded field, writing. 
ARTHUR Maybe someone will see her potential. 
VIVIENNE We all know who's seen her potential. 
NAOMI Meaning? 
VIVIENNE Oh, of course, you don't know, do you? 
Arthur suddenly goes pale. 
ARTHUR Vivienne, please. Don't... 
NAOMI What is going on here? 
VIVIENNE My son became fond of you. You're not the first. Or the last, I imagine. Anyway I was scanning his monthly expenses - which always makes for entertaining reading, all those gifts for all those girls - and found he'd bought an entire publishing company called...what was it now? Rainbow Press. 
NAOMI You bought Rainbow press? So you could tell them to publish my book? 
VIVIENNE He knows people, dear. I'm sure you do too, though the people you know tend not to own books, let alone publishers. Arthur, I trust we'll see you back at the party? Susan's a little worried. 
Vivienne leaves. Naomi storms away. Arthur chases. 
ARTHUR NAOMI! PLEASE! I didn't think I would ever see you again. I was just trying to give you some... 
NAOMI (GASPS) Confidence? Self esteem isn't a gift, Arthur! It isn't a fur coat or a thousand billion orchids or an apartment made from truffles or whatever else you rich freaks use to express love! 
Arthur looks incredibly hurt. 
ARTHUR I do express love! I love you! 
NAOMI Don't say that! 
ARTHUR You just told me to! And stop going on about me being rich! You think it's easy being trapped by money? 
Naomi gets her old phone out. She speaks into it. 
NAOMI Hello, Amnesty? Come quick! Arthur's being held against his will in Guantamoney Bay! 
ARTHUR Abu Greed? 
NAOMI Stop riffing with me! How dare you do what you did. I didn't need your money to feel good about myself! 
ARTHUR No. Being cheap gives you that. 
NAOMI Huh? 
ARTHUR At least I'm prepared to have fun. To live. I'm not all `Oooh look at me with my antique food, aren't I cool?' And...and...your phone's RUBBISH! It's made of bits of old doorbell and vibrator, I bet you can only get calls from 1994 on it! 
NAOMI (BOILS OVER) As long as I don't get any from a drunk, rich fuck up like you! 
A door opens. 
SUSAN Hello? I heard shouting. 
NAOMI I'm an employee of Arthur's. I came to complain about the conditions. 
ARTHUR Naomi, please... 
NAOMI Mr Bach-Templemead, I know you thought putting half and half in the staff kitchen was an improvement. (REALLY ANGRY) But some people prefer Coffee Mate! You were disrespectful. I quit! 
Naomi walks away, slamming a door behind her. 
SUSAN Because you changed the creamer? (BEAT) Arthur, Marty called from the hospital. 
ARTHUR It's okay, Hobson's fine. I spoke to her doctor. 
SUSAN Apparently you didn't. 
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT 
Hobson is lying in bed, looking even iller than before. 
HOBSON It's just a headache! 
ARTHUR Stop saying that! You bribed a hospital orderly to tell me you were okay! 
ARTHUR Naomi! 
Arthur pushes his way through the tourists. He sees her bus and headset. 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) You're on a bus? With a microphone? 
NAOMI Girl's gotta have a dream. 
ARTHUR Naomi. Can you take the next 60 years off? 
NAOMI Are you okay? You're a mess. You look like you...now. 
ARTHUR Sorry. I accidentally swallowed three bottles of hand sanitizer. Fascinating story...Okay. (MORE) 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) Drinking was the only way I could get the courage to come here and say this: I don't need the money. I love the money. But I don't lie awake all night wondering how I'll live without ever seeing it again. I just wonder what it's like to go 24 hours without a steak tartare. 
Naomi looks unconvinced. Arthur pulls out his wallet and takes out a load of credit cards. 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) The American Express Centurion card - you have to spend at least $250,000 a year to keep it, which I blow in a quiet week. 
He drops it down a drain. He produces another card. 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) Sotheby's `World Elite' Mastercard for art collectors. 
Drops it down drain too. The tourists are enjoying this. 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) And King of all idiotic reckless- SPEND-THE-FUCK-OUT-OF-EVERYTHING- FOR-TOMORROW-WE-DIE PLASTIC insanity: the Visa Black Card. 
This last one he hands to a PASSING HOMELESS MAN. 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) PIN 3487. Daily ATM limit $180,000. 
The man runs into the road. As Arthur talks, out of focus we see the man hit by a car, but get up and keep going. 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) (producing fancy iPhone) The world's only platinum iPhone. With police radio app. 
He tosses it over his shoulder. It lands in the beef juice pan of a Street French Dip stall. A BIGGER CROWD is gathering. Arthur takes off his jacket. 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) Alexander Amosu. Vicuna wool, shorn once every three years from the South American camelid - $50,000. 
He throws the jacket in a passing cab's window. He takes off his pants. 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) Westmancott trousers, ten months to design, fit and make. $21,000. 
He hands the trousers to a PASSERBY. Off with his watch! 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) (SHOUTS) Who wants the watch Neil Armstrong wore to step on the sun! 
Arthur flings it in the air. A crazed fight breaks out. 
Arthur stands before Naomi in just his underpants and socks. 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) These are from The Gap. 
NAOMI I'm so sorry about Hobson. 
They step away from the tourists. 
ARTHUR I'm sorry about the Rainbow Press. 
NAOMI It's okay. So how did Susan take it that you're not marrying her? 
ARTHUR She didn't. 
NAOMI You haven't told her? 
ARTHUR What's it to you? She's your arch- enemy. 
NAOMI Are you six? She isn't my enemy. She's the woman you proposed to! 
ARTHUR I couldn't tell her! Today's the biggest day of her life! 
NAOMI The wedding's today? When? 
ARTHUR 12. Which is... (looks at his wrist) Where's my watch gone? 
NAOMI (looks at her watch) It's eight minutes to. 
ARTHUR It's too late, then. 
Naomi hands Arthur her phone. 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) TAXI! 
A taxi stops. Arthur throws the money to THE DRIVER. 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) How far can I go with $1.95 and a Japanese coin with a hole in it? 
DRIVER A block and a half. 
ARTHUR GO! 
Arthur jumps in. The cab screeches away. 
EXT. SEVENTH AVENUE - DAY 
The cab halts. Arthur jumps out and starts running again. He sees A BUS with `COLUMBUS CIRCLE' in its window. 
We cut to people cheering Arthur, hanging on the bus's front bicycle rack. But the DRIVER sees him and hits the brakes. Arthur's flung forwards but gets up and keeps running. 
He sees a Subway Station. 
ARTHUR (TO PASSERBY) Excuse me, are there trains down there, like in films? 
PASSERBY Yes. 
Arthur runs down the steps. 
INT. SUBWAY - DAY 
A train pulls on to the platform. Arthur leaps aboard. 
INT. TRAIN - DAY 
Arthur stands among New Yorkers, none of whom bat an eyelid at his appearance. He looks up at the stations. 
ARTHUR (to A MALE PASSENGER) Excuse me. Terribly sorry to bother you, but... 
Without looking at him, the guy hands him a dollar. 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) Crikey. Thanks. 
INT. CHURCH. SACRISTY - DAY - CONTINUOUS 
Susan is ready. She looks to the door. Erica, who is peering out, shakes her head with an `I told you so' look. 
INT. NAOMI'S TOUR BUS - DAY 
Naomi's driving her bus up 42nd Street. 
NAOMI (into a headset mic) ...originally a rough neighbourhood. Some say it was called 42nd Street because it wasn't safe to spend more than forty seconds on it. 
A few grudging laughs from the tourists. 
MALE TOURIST Excuse me. 
NAOMI If you burst into song, you're off this bus. 
MALE TOURIST Huh? I want to see St. John the Divine. 
NAOMI Sorry, sir, that's not on our route today. Anyway... 
FEMALE TOURIST I want to know if Arthur's gonna make it. 
OTHER FEMALE TOURIST (CONT'D) You should be there for him. 
Other tourists agree. 
MALE TOURIST (WAVES LEAFLET) It says here `ask about your personalised tours'. I want the personalised tour. To St. John the Divine! 
ALL OTHER TOURISTS So do I! St. John the Divine, St. John the Divine, St. John the... 
NAOMI Okay! 
EXT. STREET. DAY 
Arthur comes bounding out of another station. Clutching his dollar, he sees a bus. He runs aboard, and up to the driver. 
ARTHUR Ah! I'm trying to get to... 
Arthur feels eyes on him. The bus is full of SCHOOL CHILDREN! It's a school bus! They all stare for a beat, then get out cellphones to report the weirdo in their midst, who runs off again and up Broadway, passing a store's line of shopping carts. He starts emptying them of quarters. 
MANAGER Hey!

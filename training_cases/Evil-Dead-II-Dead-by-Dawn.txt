CAMERA MOVING swiftly down a dark tunnel. A light at the end growing closer. The SOUND of AIR RUSHING BY. The Delta 88 Oldsmobile comes ROARING out of the tunnel with a BLAST of AIR, and the sound of loud rock and roll music. 
NARRATOR (V.O.) It was one week later that a group of college students came to the cabin. 
14A   EXT. CABIN - NIGHT - TRACKING SHOT                    14A 
The Delta 88 Oldsmobile parked out front.  Fog roars past the place.  We faintly hear waltz music from within.  The silhouette of a woman sweeps by the rear bedroom window. 
14B   INT. CABIN - REAR BEDROOM - NIGHT                     14B ASH AND LINDA 
LINDA, an attractive college student, is waltzing in the semi darkness of the bedroom.  She wears a "Michigan State University" sweatshirt.  She hums melodically to the music as she moves.  Around her neck is draped a delicate silver necklace. 
14C   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH AND LINDA                           14C 
A handsome young man, ASH, is playing the waltz music on an old wooden piano.  Linda dances behind him.  Ash is not a very good pianist, and can only plunk out the melody with two fingers. 
LINDA Ash, what's that you're playing? 
ASH Our song. 
Ash begins to play faster. 
14D   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH AND LINDA                           14D

14E   CLOSE SHOT - LINDA                                    14E 
Out of breath, hair tousled across her eyes, she stares deeply into Ash's eyes.  Her lips, parted, in a sensual manner. 
14F   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      14F

LINDA Ow! 
14G   SHE PULLS AWAY SUDDENLY                               14G 
And looks down to the tiny silver necklace that she wears about her neck.

They kiss and now begin to dance together, to the haunting waltz melody that sweeps up upon the soundtrack.

The cabin is in the distance.  In the foreground the earth begins to swell, then rips apart as a red glow emanates from beneath.  Something evil is being unleashed. 
NARRATOR (V.O.) One by one, they fell to the possession of the dark spirits. 
He lifts his face from the mud, and turns toward us. His eyes have gone white. His skin is now a pale color, his lips, jet black.  He is Possessed.  A bright edge of morning sunlight moves across his face.  He turns his beastly face skyward.

A hideous human skull with living eyeballs that stare out at us with evil malice.  The eyes stare out from the two dark windows.  The dark nose area is the open doorway, and the rotted teeth of the skull are the whitewashed stones placed at the foot of the cabin. Then it fades, leaving only the cabin.

Camera moves through the main room and up to the Hallway door.  It shatters in front of us.  We close in on Ash as he races down the hallway.  We lose him as he swings into the back bedroom of the cabin and slams the door behind him.  We rip through this door and enter the rear bedroom, only to see Ash scrambling for the door to the middle bedroom, which we approach and he swings shut in our face.  We rip through to reveal Ash scurrying into the Hallway.  We follow him through the bathroom, the maze, and back out into the Hallway.  We round the corner after him and see that Ash has led us into the main room, but there is not a trace of him.  We look about for him, but he is gone. The hallway is bare except for a few dry leaves.

The CAMERA PANS down from this desk to reveal a trap door in the floor of the main room.  The trap door to the cellar.  It is raised up on its hinge an inch or so and in that slight space between the trap door and the floor we see Ash's eyes, looking cautiously about.  He breathes a sigh of relief.

The tiny figure of Ash can be seen looking off toward this hill.  In the foreground is a crude burial cross and a mound of earth.  The earth begins to crack and splinter.  The wooden cross caves in and is swallowed as the headless corpse of Linda pulls itself to its feet.  The HAUNTING WALTZ MELODY sweeps through the night air.

The WALTZ MELODY fills the sound track, and the rotting corpse that was Linda begins to dance, bending and swaying as she sweeps gracefully through the evening fog.  A waltz of the dead. 
The style of dance begins to change.  It becomes more primitive.  The music changes to a more primal beat. The dance becomes sexually oriented.  Erotic, with sharp pelvic thrusts and gyrating hip motions.

225   EXT. WOODS - NIGHT                                    225 
A hiking trail winds through the woods.  Bobby Joe leads the way with flashlight in hand.  She pockets some bills.  She is followed by Annie and Ed who carry the glass case containing the missing pages and the handbag.  A grunting and sweating Jake brings up the rear, the large steamer trunk on his back. He is cursing under his breath. 
JAKE Jesus H. Christ!  I thought she was talkin' 'bout them two goddamn little pieces!

227   EXT. CABIN - NIGHT                                    227 
The wind rushes fog about the place with a fury. A large moon hangs in the night sky. 
As it taunts ASH it inadvertently sidesteps into a rusting mousetrap.  SNAP!  It springs shut upon the hand.  It screams furiously and shakes violently in an effort to get free the from trap. 
256   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      256 
Throws back his head in a gruff bark of laughter. 
ASH Ha!

The hand throws the trap from itself and raises its middle finger to ASH, flipping him the bird.

259   ASH'S POV - OVER THE GUN BARREL                       259 
Pointed directly at the hand.  But the hand dodges away from the hole, disappearing again behind the wall.  The gun continues to track the evil hand's progress through its pitter patter sound. 
260   CLOSE SHOT - ASH'S EAR                                260 
The pitter patter ebbs and then peaks in volume. 
261   ASH'S POV - OVER THE GUN BARREL - SQUIB               261 
Both triggers are squeezed.  BLAM!  BLAM! A 2nd and 3rd hole are blown in the wall.  All is silent.

263   CLOSE SHOT - HOLE IN WALL - 5 CAMERAS                 263 
All is silent for a moment, and then a slight trickle of blood comes dripping from the hole and down the side of the wall. 
264   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      264 
For the first time feeling victorious.  As Ash continues to stare at the hole, his expression changes to one of perplexity. 
265   CLOSE SHOT - HOLE IN WALL - 5 CAMERAS                 265 
The trickle of blood has increased to a steady flow, then, even this volume of blood multiplies.  It is forced out of the wall with a greater and greater pressure until blood pours from the wall like a fire hose. 
266   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      266 
Horrified, he spins his glance to the sound of more gushing liquid.  He is hit in the face with a geyser of deep red blood. 
267   CLOSE SHOT - 2ND AND 3RD HOLES IN WALL - 5 CAMERAS    267 
The 2nd and 3rd holes in wall also begin to spew blood in a geyser.  The CAMERA PANS over to the 4th of the holes.  This, too, is an eruption of blood.  The blood changes in color to a black fluid, then yellow, then turquoise. 
268   CLOSE SHOT - ASH - 5 CAMERAS                          268 
Screaming as he looks down at his wrist.  CAMERA PANS DOWN to it.  The severed wrist begins dribbling blood. Then in a burst, it too, erupts in a hellish fire hose. It spouts blood under such great pressure that ASH is driven against the walls of the cabin because of it. 
269   MED. SHOT - ASH - 5 CAMERAS                           269 
We follow him as he slams from one wall into another. 
270   CLOSE SHOT - ASH - 5 CAMERAS                          270 
In the midst of his scream, drowning in the blood, it all suddenly stops.  The cabin is again deadly quiet. ASH, soaked in blood and shivering, waits.  For what, he's not sure. 
271   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     271 
As he slowly backs away from the walls and sits upon the three legged chair.  It shatters beneath him, dumping him on his butt. 
CREAK!!! 
ASH turns sharply to the low sound. 
272   ASH'S POV - CLOSE SHOT                                272 
The mounted moose head upon the wall.  It is in a different position.  It turns sharply towards ASH and emits a hideous cackle. 
273   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      273 
He pulls back in fear, then turns to the sound of more laughter. 
274   ASH'S POV - CLOSE SHOT                                274 
The desk lamp on its steel swivel rises and falls in synchronization with its wheezing laughter.  Ah ha ha ha ha.  Ahhhh ha ha ha ha! 
275   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      275 
Terrified, he turns to more laughter. 
276   ASH'S POV - CLOSE SHOT                                276

ANNIE Recitation of the first passage will make this "Dark Spirit" manifest itself in the flesh. 
ASH Why the hell would we want to do that? 
Annie thumbs through one or two of the other pages. 
ANNIE Recitation of the second passage creates a kind of rift in time and space, and the physical manifestation of this spirit can be forced back through this rift... to an earlier time and place.  At least that's the best translation I can ....

As her head springs down into frame and halts suddenly inches from his face.  In the silence we hear the reason:

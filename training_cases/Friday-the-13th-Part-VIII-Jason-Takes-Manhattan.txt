INT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS 
as Suzy's eyes flash open. 
SUZY Did you hear that? 
JIM Hear what? 
He pulls her back down. 
SUZY C'mon, I'm serious. 
He knows the mood is broken. 
JIM All right, I'll check it out. 
He slips on his jeans, exiting the cabin. She pulls the sheet up around her fearfully. 
EXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT (TANK) 
as the cable smolders, void of electricity now. TRACK to find the chains again...but they're dangling loosely. JASON IS GONE. 
INT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS 
Suzy is tensely kneeling on the bed now. The black void of night is all she sees out the cabin door, which Jim has left open. An uncomfortable amount of time passes. 
SUZY Jimmy...? 
No answer. Her heart starts to pound. 
SUZY Jim...? 
Again, nothing. She wraps herself in the sheet, moving towards the open door. The ship creaks again. 
SUZY'S POINT OF VIEW 
as she grows closer to the doorway, nothing but pitch- black beyond it. 
SUZY Stop screwing around, Jim. I mean it... 
...And just as she reaches the door: 
A HOCKEY MASKED MONSTER 
leaps out, clutching a HUGE KNIFE. Suzy barely has time to scream before JASON PLUNGES THE KNIFE INTO HER CHEST. 
SUZY 
stands there in speechless shock, looking down at her mortal wound. But there's no blood. 
THE MONSTER 
pulls the knife back out, pushing the blade in and out with his hand. It's a retractable rubber knife. JIM pulls off the hockey mask with a huge grin, tossing it aside. 
JIM Gotcha good, baby cakes. 
She doesn't know whether to hug him with relief or kick him in the balls. He pulls her back onto the bed, laughing. 
EXT. HOUSEBOAT - CLOSE ON HOCKEY MASK 
sitting dormant on the deck, where Jim tossed it. A SHADOW FALLS ACROSS IT...followed by a SLIMY, DECOMPOSING HAND. The hand grabs it like it's an old friend, pulling it away. 
INT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS 
as Jim holds his angry girlfriend down on the bed, trying unsuccessfully to kiss her. 
JIM All right, all right -- I'm a major ass. 
SUZY And you'll never do it again. 
JIM And I'll never do it again. Forgive me? 
SUZY No. 
She's resisting only for effect. Her legs curl around him, finally giving in. 
EXT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT 
A deadly-sharp SPEAR GUN rests in its rack outside the cabin. JASON'S HAND REMOVES IT. 
INT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS 
The sheets begin to roll like waves as they work each other. Thoughts of Jason are nonexistent now. 
ANGLE - CABIN DOOR 
Nothing there for a moment...then a pair of moss-covered BARE FEET SLOSH INTO FRAME. 
SUZY 
closes her eyes with pleasure... 
ANGLE - CABIN DOOR 
...and camera RISES from the mossy feet, up the bloodless legs and torso to ultimately reveal the hockey-masked face of our anti-hero: JASON VOORHEES. 
RENNIE What about not-so-great writers? 
Rennie smiles self-deprecatingly, Miss Van Deusen grinning back. But Rennie's smiles are few and far between, this one disappearing as she glances out the window. 
RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (SECOND UNIT) 
as the countless gallons of harbor and lake water spread out before her, eery in the bog. A small ROWBOAT grazes across it occupied by two indistinguishable people. 
RETURN TO SHOT 
Rennie's eyes show a hidden terror. She quickly turns away, shivering briefly. Miss Van Deusen notices. She turns a corner, heading into the parking lot. 
MISS VAN DEUSEN Everything okay? 
RENNIE Just felt a little chill. 
Rennie rubs her arms, faking coldness. 
MISS VAN DEUSEN Did you know that I'm giving up teaching? 
RENNIE Really? 
MISS VAN DEUSEN Since the school is closing anyway, I'm going to write that novel I've been threatening on everybody. 
RENNIE That's wonderful, Miss Van Deusen...what's it about? 
She parks the car, turning off the ignition. 
MISS VAN DEUSEN A senior class cruise to Manhattan, laced with romance, adventure and murder. (beat) Or a Gothic cook book. I haven't decided which. 
She's coaxed the smile out of Rennie again. Miss Van Deusen pulls a small wrapped box from her glove compartment, handing it to Rennie, who seems utterly surprised. 
MISS VAN DEUSEN Go on, open it. 
Rennie pops off the lid, revealing an antique ink-dip pen. 
MISS VAN DEUSEN Stephen King supposedly used it when he was in high school. 
RENNIE I don't know what to say... 
MISS VAN DEUSEN Rennie, you're the best student I ever had...you have a real gift. If anybody can make use of that pen, it's you. 
Rennie hugs her teacher. Camera RISES above the car's window, finding a Mercedes 560 SL pulling in a short distance away. 
CLOSER ANGLE - MERCEDES 
A sexy, money-dressed blonde is behind the wheel. TAMARA MASON. She climbs from her leather seats as a trio of SENIOR GIRLS walk by, offering enthusiastic hi's and hellos. She's obviously Miss Popular. Tamara crosses to a cute Japanese girl unloading luggage from a beige Honda, EVA WATANABE. 
. TAMARA Are you ready for drugs, sex and rock 'n roll or what, girl? 
Eva gives her a warning glance, nodding to her left. Eva's MOTHER appears by the passenger door, forcing a smile at Tamara. 
MRS. WATANABE Hello, Tamara. 
TAMARA Hi, Mrs. Watanabe. Just kidding. 
MRS. WATANABE Yes, I'm sure. 
Embarrassed, Eva hurries to her Mom, rushing a kiss goodbye. 
EVA Don't worry about a thing, Mom. I'll have a terrific time and I won't do anything stupid, okay? 
Before Mrs. Watanabe can squeeze a word in, her daughter is gone. She waves a bittersweet goodbye to her graduate. 
MRS. WATANABE I love you... 
TRACKING WITH TAMARA AND EVA 
Once they're out of Mrs. Watanabe's earshot -- 
TAMARA I hear the crew members are cute guys in their twenties. 
EVA Really? 
TAMARA I'm sure we'll have no problem getting them to party with us...especially with this. 
Tamara unzips her purse, revealing a baggie filled with fine white powder. Eva looks very nervous. 
TAMARA It's my graduation gift from Daddy. It cost over a thousand bucks but it's the best. 
EVA He bought you that? 
TAMARA More or less. It's part of my college fund. 
She grins coquettishly, walking on. Camera HOLDS on the calm, foggy harbor...where the faint image of a HOUSEBOAT is aimlessly drifting into port. 
CLOSER ANGLE - HOUSEBOAT 
Sure enough, it's the same one we saw JASON on last night...but no one is behind the helm. It seems to be a ghost ship. 
EXT. DOCKSIDE - DAY 
as Tamara tries to slip past McCulloch, busy with another pair of seniors. 
MCCULLOCH You can stop right there, Miss Mason. 
AN EIGHT YEAR OLD BOY 
floundering in the water. It takes us only a moment to recognize him -- IT'S YOUNG JASON. He's gasping, sucking in huge amounts of liquid, exactly like he did in the prologue. 
YOUNG JASON Hhhhelp me....I'm drowning... 
RENNIE 
leans back in terror, falling into Miss Van Deusen. 
MISS VAN DEUSEN What's wrong, Rennie?? 
Rennie frantically points over the ramp edge, unable to speak. Miss Van Deusen quickly looks and sees: 
MISS VAN DEUSEN'S POINT OF VIEW 
The water is calm. No Young Jason. 
RETURN TO SHOT 
as Rennie gets a hold of herself. 
RENNIE I just got a little dizzy. I'm fine. 
She continues up the ramp. HOLD on Miss Van Deusen, watching her go, somewhat troubled by it. RACK to McCulloch below her, also watching. Extremely concerned. 
RENNIE 
continues along the starboard side, not risking another glance overboard. She passes an older, very deranged DECK HAND, mopping the deck. HOLD on him, his bloodshot eyes following her like a crazed raven. 
INT. BRIDGE - CLOSE ON HARPOON - DAY 
Sharp and rusty, mounted on the wall amidst jagged scaling knives, shark jaws and other artifacts. WIDEN to reveal they are surrounding a navigational chart on the cruise ship's bridge. Admiral Robertson and his CHIEF ENGINEER are preparing for departure, checking the OMEGA satellite computer as well as the LORAN. 
ADMIRAL ROBERTSON (checking watch) Let's take in the brow. 
CHIEF ENGINEER Yes Sir. (into intercom phone.) Take in the gangway and single up all lines. 
SEAN and MILES enter the room; Sean gets a glance from his Dad. Miles is very impressed with the bridge. 
SEAN Hello, Dad. 
MILES Hey, Admiral Robertson. Love your ship. 
ADMIRAL ROBERTSON She's a beauty, isn't she? I should've retired from the Navy ten years ago. 
MILES You've really been generous to give us this cruise. I know I speak for everybody on board. 
Everybody...with the possible exception of Sean. He avoids eye contact with his father. 
ADMIRAL ROBERTSON Hell, there's just twenty or so of you -- we only need a skeleton crew and it's a pleasure to sail her anyway. (beat) By the way, congratulations on winning the intramural diving championships, Miles. I'm sure you made your old man proud. 
Admiral Robertson gives his own son a glance; maybe Sean should think about doing the same. 
CHIEF ENGINEER Have you decided on your departure protocol, Admiral? 
ADMIRAL ROBERTSON Actually, I thought I'd leave the honors to my son. 
SEAN Dad, I don't think... 
ADMIRAL ROBERTSON (to Chief Engineer, ignoring Sean) Relinquishing command of the Princess Ruby to Captain Sean Robertson. 
Sean has no say in the matter. Miles can feel his friend's nervousness as well. 
ADMIRAL ROBERTSON But before you take the helm, take this. 
He tosses Sean a wrapped box. Sean opens it. Inside is a navigational computer the size of a calculator, sitting next to a rusty old sextant. 
ADMIRAL ROBERTSON Something old and something new. I used the sextant when I was your age, but now they have these goddamn computers to do all the work for you. 
CHIEF ENGINEER (to Sean) Have you decided on a plan of departure, Captain? 
Sean's nervous. He eyes the Omega, quickly glancing at the LORAN, briefly referring to the navigational chart. 
SEAN How about if we start up the forward engines and come around. 180 degrees... 
ADMIRAL ROBERTSON Aren't you forgetting something? 
Sean looks flustered. Admiral Robertson storms to a large button, pressing it three times, piercing the air with three long blasts of the ship's horn. It underscores his frustration. 
ADMIRAL ROBERTSON We're in foggy weather! Send out the international maritime signal that a vessel is backing down, followed by a security broadcast warning other ships! 
He shoves the mike out at Sean, but he doesn't grab it, leaving the bridge, humiliated. There's an awkward moment for Miles, unable to find any appropriate words. He exits as well. Admiral Robertson stares out the bridge window, saddened and frustrated. It wasn't supposed to go this way. 
EXT. DECK - ON SEAN 
as he continues away, his retreat blocked by the DECK HAND. The crazy old man pierces a dead serious stare at Sean. 
DECK HAND This voyage is doomed. 
SEAN Yeah, tell me about it. 
Sean sidesteps him, moving on. 
EXT. HARBOR - DAY (CRANE SHOT) 
WAYNE I'll catch you later. 
He exits. She mumbles something under her breath, coiling up her amp cord. 
INT. CORRIDOR - TRACKING WITH WAYNE 
as he walks onward. DROP DOWN to find his FEET as he passes a DARK ALCOVE...which happens to have SLIMY FOOTPRINTS AND SEAWEED leading into it. Camera FOLLOWS the footprints, RISING again and with dim recognition, our eyes fall on JASON. Lurking in the shadows. But not for long. 
INT. POWER ROOM - DAY 
Massive, very dark, backlit steam seeping from a maze of pipes overhead. No windows. A wall of circuit breakers and voltage meters decorate one wall, quietly humming generators on the opposite side. J.J. appears with her guitar, amp and ghetto blaster, appreciative of the surroundings. 
J.J. This place is aching for a video. Wayne, you're an asshole. 
She finds an outlet and plugs in her equipment. 
JASON'S POINT OF VIEW 
We're peering at J.J. predatorially through the steam, moving through it, behind the generators. 
J.J. 
pops a cassette into her blaster, jamming the "play" button. A loud rock 'n roll rhythm track blasts out. 
JASON'S POINT OF VIEW 
moving around the generators, eyeing her sleek leather pants as she bends over to plug in her axe. 
TIGHT ON ELECTRIC GUITAR 
as J.J. snaps the male end of the plug into the female. receptacle. 
JASON'S FACE 
appears for an instant through the vapor, then vanishes. J.J. 
screams out the opening licks of her solo in sync with her playback. The generators are causing a breeze which makes her hair dance, steam flowing between her legs. She's lost in her music, building to a crescendo, bending the high "E" string above the upper octave fret. She opens her eyes with the pleasure of it and sees: 
JASON 
emerging from a cloud of vapor like her worst nightmare. 
EXT. UPPER DECK - SAME TIME 
as J.J.'s SCREAM echoes from an exhaust duct. WHIP PAN to find the crazed DECK HAND standing just below it, reacting with dread. He's the only one who has heard it. 
INT. POWER ROOM - SAME TIME 
as Jason tears the guitar off her body, raising it in the air like a hatchet. The horrified girl flees down a narrow maze of steel steps, forced back against a generator with nowhere to go. PUSH IN on her face for one last look at her before: 
JASON 
swings the guitar downward and buries it in J.J.'s skull. 
EXT. UPPER DECK - SAME TIME 
as the Deck Hand flinches upon the thick, dull sound of her demise, followed by discordant feedback from her guitar...and eventual silence. He reaches into his breast pocket, his hand shaking badly as he sips from a flask of Early Times. 
EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT (EFX) 
as LIGHTNING FLASHES over a gray, choppy sea. A storm is imminent. The Princess Ruby finally appears, cutting through whitecaps, no land in sight. 
CLOSE UP - INK DIP PEN 
as Rennie's hand carefully dips it in India ink, moving to a blank page in her journal. She hesitates for several beats. 
INT. RENNIE'S STATEROOM - NIGHT 
No inspiration. She puts down the pen, looking at her dog, who's curled up on the bed. 
RENNIE What do you think...time for some personal experiences to fuel our minds? 
The dog's eyes blink, but no more than that. 
RENNIE I agree. 
Rennie moves to her closet, finding a silk blouse and some black satin pants. 
EXT. OUTSIDE DECK - SAME TIME 
Wind is picking up, sweeping thick mist past a row of decorative flags. One of them flaps back...AND EXPOSES JASON. 
THROUGH JASON'S EYES (FLYING WALL EFX) 
as the flag whips our faces. We MOVE through it, down the empty passageway, coming to a porthole window. Rennie's window. We peer through it with unnerving intensity at the backside of Rennie as she pulls off her T-shirt, slipping on the blouse. Camera continues through the tiny round window, floating across the room, over Toby and the bed...until we're INCHES FROM THE BACK OF RENNIE'S HEAD. She suddenly spins around in fright, facing us point-blank, and: 
REVERSE ANGLE 
Nobody is there, her porthole window empty. But there's something surreal about the window... 
TIGHT ON PORTHOLE WINDOW (EFX) 
Empty grayness...then EIGHT YEAR OLD JASON FLOATS UP FROM BELOW, BUBBLES ESCAPING FROM HIS LIPS. The porthole has become a window into the depths of Crystal Lake. 
RENNIE 
Eva takes the straw. 
STALKING POINT OF VIEW 
as we move down the corridor, in and out of shadows, hearing giggles from Tamara and Eva up ahead. Jason's coming... 
ANGLE - TAMARA AND EVA 
as Eva takes a nosefull, sneezing badly. 
TAMARA Is that unbelievable or what? 
Tamara giggles, getting ready to tap out another line. But the snickering stops upon the sound of APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS. They both look up, every muscle tensing with fear as: 
RENNIE 
appears from the shadows, just as startled to see them. It's not Jason at all. Rennie can't help noticing the cocaine, trying hard to ignore it. 
TAMARA Jesus, you scared the hell out of us. 
RENNIE Have you seen my dog? I think he came this way. 
TAMARA No, we haven't. (awkwardly) Care for a hit? 
RENNIE No thanks. 
Rennie continues on. After she's gone... 
TAMARA A real space cadet. I wonder if she'll narc on us... 
EVA I have her in Creative Writing and she's fairly nice. 
TAMARA Nobody related to McCulloch can be nice. 
Tamara puts the straw to her nose. 
ANGLE - RENNIE 
as she presses on, the corridor getting darker. 
RENNIE Toby? 
No reply. She walks on, turning down the left hallway... but camera turns down the right hallway. Suddenly JASON REVEALS HIMSELF, quietly stepping from the GAME ROOM. He's holding a pool cue, which he proceeds to snap in half, providing a splintery sharp shaft. 
INT. SERVICE AREA - SAME TIME 
as Tamara finishes off her line, wiping her nose with a sniffle. 
TAMARA Oh yeah. Ready to party and then some. 
She rolls up her baggie, stuffing it into her purse. 
STALKING POINT OF VIEW 
as we come down a corridor, turning into the Service Area, stomping right up to Tamara and Eva. They both GASP; Tamara drops her mirror, which SHATTERS on the ground. 
REVERSE ANGLE 
They are facing McCulloch. 
MCCULLOCH What are you doing in here? 
TAMARA Nothing. 
He eyes the broken mirror. He wasn't born yesterday. 
MCCULLOCH Are you girls using drugs? 
EVA Do you think I would use drugs, Mr. McCulloch? We were just exploring the ship. 
He doesn't want to believe Eva is a druggie. But Tamara is a different matter. He levels his eyes on her. 
MCCULLOCH I'11 be coming around your stateroom in exactly fifteen minutes, Miss Mason. You'd better have your biology project ready or I'm phoning your parents. 
TAMARA They're out of town. 
MCCULLOCH Then I'll make sure you remain on board while your classmates see the sights. 
He's gotten to her with that one. McCulloch storms away. 
EVA What are you going to do? 
TAMARA Relax, I've got McCulloch covered... but that little narcing bitch niece of his is a different matter. (calculating) Rumor has it she's a teensy bit afraid of the water... 
SPLASH! 
as a body pierces the surface of the deck swimming pool. It's MILES, having just completed a dive from the high board. Miss Van Deusen and several others stand at poolside, giving him some applause. 
MISS VAN DEUSEN Poetry in motion, Miles. 
MILES A half-twist short. I'll hone that dive yet. 
He swims to the side, leading us to a view of Rennie. She's very cautious about getting too close to the pool edge as she approaches Miss Van Deusen. 
MISS VAN DEUSEN Rennie -- I was just on my way over to your room 
Sean nods, hurrying off as others start to crowd around. Miss Van Deusen looks up at them. 
MISS VAN DEUSEN She's fine -- everybody go back to what you were doing. 
They disperse. Rennie slowly starts to cry, holding tight to her teacher. 
MISS VAN DEUSEN Care to talk about it? 
After a moment to compose herself... 
RENNIE I can't swim. 
MISS VAN DEUSEN I gathered that. 
Rennie says nothing else. Miss Van Deusen knows she's holding out. 
MISS VAN DEUSEN I had a skiing accident in high school, broke my left leg. It took three winters before I would even look at the snow again...but the solution kept eluding me. (beat) I finally took lessons. I've never broken a bone since. 
RENNIE It's not that simple. 
MISS VAN DEUSEN Maybe not. But you're not telling me everything, are you? 
RENNIE (long pause) Whenever I get near the water, I see this young boy drowning. He tries to pull me down with him. 
The teacher didn't expect this, taking a thoughtful pause. 
MISS VAN DEUSEN When did this start? 
RENNIE About four years ago...at Crystal Lake. I spent a few summers there with Uncle Charles inbetween boarding school. 
MISS VAN DEUSEN After your parents passed away? 
Rennie nods somberly. 
MISS VAN DEUSEN Did you have an accident in the lake? 
RENNIE No. It was just a normal summer. I've never been able to figure it out. 
MISS VAN DEUSEN Only one young boy ever drowned in that lake, and that was before you were even born. His name was Jason Voorhees. 
The name has triggered some deep memory...but the recollection vanishes upon the sound of her uncle's voice. 
MCCULLOCH (O.S.) Dear God... 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
as McCulloch rushes over to Rennie, seeing that she's soaked. He's livid. 
MISS VAN DEUSEN She's fine, Charles. Take it easy... 
MCCULLOCH Oh, I can see that. You've done a wonderful job of supervising the kids, Miss Van Deusen. 
RENNIE It wasn't her fault. 
He gets Rennie to her feet just as Sean runs back with a towel. McCulloch grabs it from him, wrapping it around his niece, facing both Miss Van Deusen and Sean. 
MCCULLOCH Stay away from her...both of you. 
He starts to lead her away. The crazy DECK HAND blocks their path, slipping his flask away. 
DECK HAND He's come back and you're all going to die. 
Rennie gazes at the Deck Hand, then back at McCulloch. 
RENNIE Just...leave me alone... 
She pulls away from him, hurrying off, confused and frightened. McCulloch's retinas pierce the Deck Hand with scorn. He checks his watch, then storms off. 
INT. TAMARA'S STATEROOM - NIGHT 
as a loud, firm KNOCK punctuates the silence. Then comes a sultry voice... 
TAMARA (O.S.) The door's open. 
McCulloch swings it open. 
MCCULLOCH I'm in no mood for any more stall tactics, Miss Mason. Where is your final project? 
REVERSE ANGLE 
as Tamara fills a pair of champagne glasses with a bottle of Dom Perignon. She's wearing a full body robe. 
TAMARA Wouldn't you like a glass of champagne first, Charles? 
He's about to lose his temper. McCulloch steps closer. 
MCCULLOCH Where did you get that alcohol? 
TAMARA I packed it. Just for us. 
EXT. DECK CORRIDOR - STALKING POINT OF VIEW 
as we approach Tamara's porthole window, peering through it. We can't hear the words but we can clearly see the people. 
INT. TAMARA'S STATEROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Jason raises the shard above her and just as she SHRIEKS... 
CLOSE UP - STEAM WHISTLE OF SHIP 
as it blasts loudly in the bleak stormy night. It begins to rain. 
EXT. LADIES RESTROOM - NIGHT 
as Rennie comes rushing out, right into the arms of. Sean. She clings to him, sobbing as the rain falls over them. 
SEAN It's okay...you're going to be okay. 
RENNIE I want to go home. I want off this ship. 
After a moment... 
SEAN Me too. (beat) Let's go talk to my Dad. 
He puts his arm around her, leading her toward the bridge. 
INT. BRIDGE - NIGHT 
as wind and rain pummel the bridge window.. Admiral Robertson turns to his Chief Engineer. 
ADMIRAL ROBERTSON Let's kick in the stablilizers, Mr. Carlson, and get the seas off the quarter. These kids are in for one hell of a storm. 
CHIEF ENGINEER Yes Sir. Activating comfort cruise mode. 
The Chief Engineer moves to a bank of toggle switches, flipping a row of them. 
TIGHT ON NAVIGATIONAL CHART WALL - SAME TIME 
as a bloodstained HAND silently removes the rusty harpoon hanging above the map. 
ADMIRAL ROBERTSON 
gets a reflective look in his weary eyes. 
ADMIRAL-ROBERTSON How olds your boy now, Carlson? 
CHIEF ENGINEER Nineteen months. 
ADMIRAL ROBERTSON A tremendous age. Take some advice from a salty old man: don't push him too hard. 
The Chief Engineer nods with a sympathetic smile as the Admiral steps off the bridge, onto the stormy deck, contemplating the sea. The Chief Engineer moves to the radio/intercom console. He lifts a telephone, punching in a three digit number. PUSH IN TIGHT ON HIS FACE. 
CHIEF ENGINEER This is the bridge. Approaching weather suggests we secure the main deck and... 
His sentence is sharply cut off, his head jerking from excruciating, instant pain. His mouth contorts with words no one will ever hear as he stares into the face of: 
JASON 
holding the opposite end of the harpoon. He shoves it forward with one more staccato jerk and: 
CLOSE UP - CHIEF ENGINEER'S BACK 
-- The harpoon's bloody, corroded tip pierces through his once-white uniform. 
ADMIRAL ROBERTSON 
returns to the bridge as LIGHTNING flashes outside. 
ADMIRAL ROBERTSON Better have them doublecheck the lifeboat stations as well... 
Admiral Robertson stops cold upon the sight of Mr. Carlson. He hurries over to him, kneeling down, freezing as a pair of MUDDY FEET ENTER FRAME. Admiral Robertson bends his neck upwards to face: 
JASON 
hovering over him, now clutching one of the scaling knives. 
INT. BRIDGE CORRIDOR - NIGHT 
as Sean and Rennie walk up the corridor leading to the bridge. 
RENNIE Can he really take us home? 
SEAN Not completing a voyage is against everything he stands for. But I think I can convince him to call a Coast Guard cutter for you. 
RENNIE What about you? 
SEAN If I go with you, he'll never speak to me again. (beat) But I'm never going to live up to his expectations anyway...so maybe it's the right thing to do. 
He's made a big decision. Sean takes her hand as they walk on. 
THEIR POINT OF VIEW 
moving closer and closer to the bridge door, having not the slightest inclination of what's in store for them. 
SEAN 
knocks on the bridge door. No answer. He's confused. He pushes the door open but something is blocking it. Sean puts his weight into it, shoving hard. 
INT. BRIDGE 
as the door slides open, Sean stepping inside. His eyes roil downwards upon seeing THE DEAD CHIEF ENGINEER, THE HARPOON PROTRUDING FROM HIS BLOODY CHEST. 
SEAN The bow...front of the ship. There's a hoist on each side that lowers them 
She starts to exit. 
SEAN I didn't mean for you to go! 
RENNIE Just radio for help, okay??? 
She hurries out the door, working on terror-induced adrenaline. Sean rushes to the radio console, depressing the keying button, speaking into the mike. 
SEAN Mayday, mayday, mayday... 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
as JULIUS arrives with the others from the locker room. They react to the dead bodies while Sean continues at the radio. 
SEAN Please...can anybody out there hear me?? 
No response. WAYNE and MILES rush in. 
MILES Sean, what's going on? 
Then he sees the corpses. He needs no further answer. 
WAYNE Jesus Christ... 
He's too scared to even videotape it. Sean is bombarded with questions as he tries to figure out the radio. 
JULIUS Who did this, man? 
WAYNE Is the radio even working?? 
MILES Isn't there some international S.O.S. thing you can do??? 
SEAN (suddenly remembers) Channel 16...the distress frequency... (dialing knob) Mayday, mayday, mayday...this is the Princess Ruby. Please, somebody answer... 
EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT (STOCK) 
as a COAST GUARD CUTTER tracks through stormy seas. 
RADIO OFFICER (V.O.) This is Coast Guard cutter Dallas. What is the nature of your problem, Ruby? 
INT. BRIDGE - ON SEAN AND OTHERS 
as they hear the voice, reacting, relieved and thrilled. 
SEAN The Captain and Chief Engineer... they've been...they're dead. 
RADIO OFFICER (FILTERED V.O.) (a grave-pause) What is your location? 
SEAN I...I don't know... 
RADIO OFFICER (FILTERED V.O.) Is your ship equipped with Omega satellite navigation or LORAN? 
SEAN Yes... 
RADIO OFFICER (FILTERED V.O.) The LORAN has a digital printout of your latitude and longitude. Give me the coordinates and we'll be there as quick as we can. 
Sean hurries to the LORAN, reading the numbers. 
EXT. DECK - RADIO ANTENNA - SAME TIME (EFX) 
as LIGHTNING STRIKES above it in the night sky. Camera slowly ADJUSTS to find the RADIO ANTENNA CABLE. A second later, JASON'S HAND REACHES FOR IT, GETTING A FIRM GRASP. 
INT. BRIDGE - SAME TIME 
as Sean hurries back to the radio, pressing it against his spitless mouth. 
SEAN I've got the numbers. 
RADIO OFFICER (FILTERED V.O.) Give me the degrees first, followed by minutes and sec... 
Suddenly his voice is CUT OFF, followed by STATIC. 
SEAN Hello? Are you there?? 
No response. A lump sinks into everyone's throat. 
EXT. DECK - RADIO ANTENNA 
as Jason drops the cable he's just torn out, marching onward. 
EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT 
as McCulloch bursts onto the bridge, followed by Miss Van Deusen. 
MCCULLOCH I demand to know what is going on... 
MISS VAN DEUSEN Oh dear God... 
She's seen the bodies. McCulloch follows her glance, paling. He quickly takes charge, pushing through the students. 
MCCULLOCH Where's the radio? 
SEAN It's...dead. 
deciding that the time is right to strike. His hand moves to the bow entrance door knob, slowly turning it, pulling it open. 
EXT. BOW - ON RENNIE 
moving closer to the right anchor hoist, her back to us as well as Jason. She climbs behind the hoist, looking at the consoles. Then suddenly a BARK. 
RENNIE Toby? 
She turns, catching a glimpse of her dog running down the side of the deck. Rennie leaves the hoist, going after Toby. 
JASON'S POINT OF VIEW 
through the crack in the door, watching Rennie unexpectedly take off. He's about to move after her when ha hears: 
EVA (O.S.) Tamara? Are you around here anywhere? 
Jason quietly closes the door. Rennie will have to wait. 
INT. CORRIDOR - TRACKING WITH EVA 
as she cautiously walks along, poking her head in every alcove. 
EVA Tamara? 
JASON'S POINT OF VIEW 
moving down the same corridor, catching a glimpse of Eva before she turns a corner and disappears. 
INT. HALLWAY/TAMARA'S STATEROOM - MOVING WITH EVA (STEADICAM) 
Eva steps into the hallway outside Tamara's stateroom. She walks up to Tamara's door, knocking on it. It swings open, unlocked. 
EVA Tamara? (no response) I just want to talk with you. 
She steps into Tamara's room and we go in with her. The quarters are empty. Eva stands there for a beat, confused and scared. She's about to leave when a CREAKING SOUND causes her to look back at: 
THE BATHROOM DOOR 
It slowly swings open...splashing Eva's eyes with grotesque multi-images of Tamara: SHE IS HANGING ON THE DOOR HOOK, HER BODY PIN-CUSHIONED WITH A DOZEN MIRROR SRARDS. 
EVA 
shrieks, running back out the door... 
INT. STATEROOM HALLWAY 
...and sliding to a abrupt halt because JASON IS STANDING AT THE END OF THE HALLWAY. He moves toward Eva like a bulldozer. She turns a rapid 180 and sprints in retreat. 
RUNNING WITH EVA (HAND HELD) 
Gasping for oxygen, Eva has no time to even scream as she flees from the monster, erratically turning down a spiral staircase and running on. 
JASON'S POINT OF VIEW (STEADICAM) 
chasing after her with the smooth determination of a shark, never letting her get too far in the lead. 
INT. BOWELS OF SHIP - ON EVA 
Empty for a second, then Eva appears, weaving her way through a maze of corridors and passageways. She races past a sign directing passengers to "CLUB RUBY." 
ANGLE - JASON 
--entering the same corridor a beat after Eva exits it in the direction of the disco. He tramples onward. 
INT. CORRIDOR/DISCO (STEADICAM) 
The thudding low frequency of a mesmerizing dance tune precedes Eva as she tears open a door, entering the corridor. MOVE BACKWARDS WITH HER as she rushes forward, curving through the shallow passageway and emptying out onto a high tech DISCO FLOOR. A flashing Star Wars lighting system assaults her all directions along with the music. She's all alone in here. 
TIGHT ON EVA 
The lights strobing across her face only accentuate her terror. She spots another door on a small stage, rushing to it. It's locked. 
CROOKED ANGLE - ENTRANCE DOOR 
as Jason enters the corridor, SLAMMING THE DOOR SHUT BEHIND HIM. 
EVA 
decides this is the wrong place to be. She moves for the corridor again and: 
JASON 
appears on the corridor steps for a brief second. The spotlight goes black, then flashes on again. Now he's gone. 
EVA 
backs away, sliding along the edge of the dance floor like she's on a building ledge. Chaser lights and mirror balls fondle her body as she moves as far away from the point where she last saw him. But: 
JASON 
illuminates only ten feet from her, a crimson strobe assaulting his hockey mask. She's on a collision course with him. 
EVA 
whirls dizzily to the center of the dance floor upon the sight of him. Camera SPINS with her in 360 degree arcs, PUSHING IN on her face. 
JULIUS (flexes fists) Nothin'. 
WAYNE (dead serious) We're talking the possibility of Jason Voorhees here. 
Julius pauses. He's not stupid. 
JULIUS Nothin' but this gun. 
He reaches down, picking up the other rifle. And they move. 
INT. STATEROOM HALLWAY/RENNIE'S ROOM - NIGHT 
as McCulloch guides his niece down the hallway, swinging her door open. 
RENNIE Can't we at least talk about it? 
MCCULLOCH I refuse to discuss this ridiculous notion that a ghoul is terrorizing this ship. 
RENNIE But what about the drowning boy I've been seeing? 
He avoids eye contact. McCulloch takes her hand, ushering her across the threshold. She's standing inside her room now; he's in the hallway. 
MCCULLOCH Whatever you've been...imagining... has nothing to do with Jason Voorhees. (pause) I want you to be safe, Rennie. That's all I care about. 
RENNIE I'm not staying in my room, Uncle Charles. 
MCCULLOCH This isn't a request. 
He closes the door on her face, pulling out a key, locking the dead bolt. She pounds on it from the other side. 
RENNIE (O.S.) Uncle Charles! 
He ignores her, briskly walking away. 
INT. RENNIE'S STATEROOM - SAME TIME 
as she throws her fists against the door a final time, realizing it's futile. 
INT. POWER ROOM - NIGHT 
Steam continues to seep from the maze of criss-crossing pipes. Wayne appears on one of the catwalks. He's holding the skeet rifle under one arm, using the sun gun off his video camera to guide him. 
WAYNE J.J. -- you down here? 
CLOSER ANGLE 
as Wayne carefully lets his light guide him down the precarious walkway. An unexpected blast of steam scares the crap out of him, causing him to stumble. 
INSERT - WAYNE'S GLASSES (SECOND UNIT) 
--They slip off the bridge of his nose, skittering down through the catwalk and pipes to God knows where. 
WAYNE 
lies helplessly on the metal grid work, realizing his bleak predicament has just been squared. He pulls himself to a standing position again. 
WAYNE We got a major problem, Wayne. 
WAYNE'S BLURRY POINT OF VIEW 
His vision now gives him shadows and shapes rather than crisp images. He raises the gun and continues unsteadily forward. 
POINT OF VIEW THROUGH GRID WORK 
as Wayne inches forward. Camera slowly PANS INTO A PROFILE OF JASON, watching him from a catbird seat. 
WAYNE 
takes another step, almost tripping on a set of stairs leading down to the next level. And when he arrives there... 
WAYNE'S BLURRY POINT OF VIEW 
...A LARGE FIGURE STEPS OUT, HOLDING WHAT APPEARS TO BE A KNIFE. 
WAYNE 
instantly raises the rifle and FIRES... 
WAYNE'S BLURRY POINT OF VIEW 
...and the body goes down. He's hit him! 
WAYNE 
stands there, breathing some relief. He gets an idea, looking through his camcorder eyepiece. Wayne begins to adjust the eyepiece diaptor. 
WAYNE'S POINT OF VIEW (B & W/VIEWFINDER MATTE) 
as the figure on the ground slips in and out of focus, finally becoming crisp. WAYNE HAS SHOT A CREW MEMBER -- the same good looking one Tamara and Eva ogled earlier. He's holding a screwdriver from his waist band tool set, not a knife. 
WAYNE 
slowly lowers his camera as his heart rises into his throat. 
WAYNE No... 
as the shrieking alarm assaults the main deck, hallways and corridors, giving Julius, Miles and Wayne deep pause for thought. 
INT. RENNIE'S STATEROOM - SAME TIME 
as the alarm bombards Rennie's ears like everybody else's. She hurries to her curtained porthole window, working up the energy to look outside. Rennie gets a grip on them, FLINGING THEM OPEN. The DECK HAND'S CRAZED FACE IS GAZING BACK AT HER. Rennie screams; a second later he hurries off. 
INT. BRIDGE - NIGHT 
as McCulloch tears open a cabinet door labeled EMERGENCY FLARE GUN. The siren continues to blast. 
MCCULLOCH Can you shut that damn thing off?? 
Sean moves to a bank of switches, his eyes darting around for the appropriate switch. Miss Van Deusen sees McCulloch remove the FLARE GUN from the cabinet. 
MISS VAN DEUSEN We already thought of that -- nobody could possibly see it in this storm... 
MCCULIACH There's only one person who needs to see it. And I'm going to find him. 
MISS VAN DEUSEN What about the fire?? 
MCCULLOCH I doubt very much that one even exists. 
MISS VAN DEUSEN What are you talking about? 
MCCULLOCH Use some common sense! Setting off a fire alarm causes panic...the same kind of panic caused by suggesting Jason Voorhees is on board. (resolved) Enough is enough. 
He marches out the door. Sean finds the alarm kill switch, flipping it. The excruciating siren vanishes. He grabs a pair of rain jackets, tossing one to Miss Van Deusen. 
SEAN We have to get everybody together just in case the fire's for real. 
Sean heads for the door, shoving it forward. 
EXT. DECK - ON DOOR 
as it slams open...and JULIUS steps out, not Sean, from a different deck door. TRACK with him as he treads along the side of the ship, skeet rifle raised. 
JULIUS' POINT OF VIEW 
walking past the lifeboat stations, the wind and precipitation battering the small boats. With no warning, AN OBSCURE FIGURE LEAPS OUT, GRIPPING AN AXE. 
JULIUS 
shoves the gun stock into his shoulder and takes instantaneous aim...but he doesn't shoot. He slowly lowers the rifle. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
as MILES lowers the axe. They've just scared the shit out of each other. 
MILES I'll take the upper deck. 
Julius nods. They separate. Neither boy notices the smoke which is starting to emerge from a deck vent... 
INT. POWER ROOM - NIGHT (EFX) 
Filled with black smoke. The fire is spreading dangerously close to a series of hoses attached to a fuel pump, leading to tanks below. A sign over them reads: DANGER - FUEL TANKS. 
EXT. DECK POOL - NIGHT 
--steaming and far from calm as the weather blitzes it. Miles appears, climbing a ladder to the upper deck level. 
POINT OF VIEW THROUGH LADDER 
Someone is spying on Miles from below, watching his every step. 
EXT. UPPER DECK - CONTINUOUS 
as Miles arrives, axe raised. He pauses to regard his surroundings, then moves on. RACK FOCUS TO FIND JASON RIGHT BEHIND HIM, having followed Miles up the stairs. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
Only darkness and rain for a beat, then Miles materializes, curving around the gargantuan smokestack. He passes us and we SWING AROUND, now looking at the back of his head. He takes three more steps and JASON STEPS INTO THE FOREGROUND. Miles senses his presence and JERKS AROUND, RAISING THE AXE, BRINGING IT DOWN ON JASON'S HEAD... 
...but Jason easily grabs the axe handle before it makes contact, flinging it away. 
EXT. LOWER DECK - ON JULIUS 
He's pacing along when a clattering noise from above makes him stop. Suddenly MILES' AXE THUDS INTO THE MAHOGANY DECK NEXT TO HIS FOOT. Julius gazes at it, jerking his head upward. 
JULIUS Miles?? 
His answer is a LOUD CRACK OF LIGHTNING. At the same time: 
RUNNING WITH MILES 
He's scrambling as fast as he can across the slippery deck as the monster relentlessly pursues him. 
JASON'S POINT OF VIEW 
He's having no problem catching up to the defenseless teenager. 
EXT. DECK STAIRS - SAME TIME 
as Julius zooms up them to aid his comrade. 
EXT. RADAR MAST - NIGHT 
turns to see JASON APPROACHING THEM WITH AXE RAISED. She backs away but Jason ignores her, heading directly for the hoist. He arches back with his weapon and SLICES DOWNWARD. 
INSERT - HOIST CABLE (SECOND UNIT) 
as Jason's axe CHOPS THE CABLE IN TWO, and: 
EXT. SHIP/OCEAN (TANK) 
The bow cable SNAPS, DUMPING THE HALF DOZEN TEENAGERS INTO THE TURBULENT SALT WATER. They last about five seconds before succumbing to a drowning death. 
MISS VAN DEUSEN 
sees it all, her intestines constricting in agonizing knots. She summons all her rationale and sends it down to her legs, running away as fast as she can. 
MISS VAN DEUSEN'S POINT OF VIEW 
--knocking down deck tables, chairs and chaise lounges as she flees. The creative writing teacher swerves around a column, heading for an interior door, sliding to a stop as it BANGS OPEN IN FRONT OF HER. McCulloch steps outside, carrying Rennie, with Sean right behind her. Rennie is conscious now, squirming free of her uncle upon the sight of Miss Van Deusen. 
ANGLE TO INCLUDE ALL 
as Rennie rushes into Miss Van Deusen's arms. The teacher holds her, beginning to cry herself. 
MCCULLOCH Why aren't you with the others, woman?? 
Finally the message comes forth: 
MISS VAN DEUSEN Jason...he has an axe... 
His face grows taut with anger. 
MCCULLOCH Jason Voorhees is dead!! 
A PRIMAL SCREAM OF AGONY immediately cries out behind them, the words unintelligible. They turn around to witness THE DECK HANG STAGGERING TOWARDS THEM, GRIPPING THE KITCHEN KNIFE. 
MCCULLOCH 
raises the flare gun with zero hesitation and FIRES IT... 
ANGLE - DECK HAND (EFX) 
...and the charge EXPLODES INTO HIS CHEST. He stands there with his chest smoldering, almost like a gargoyle in effigy. A second later the poor old man falls forward, and: 
CLOSE ON HIS BACK (EFX) 
They all see that JASON'S AXE HAS BEEN BURIED IN HIS BACK. 
RETURN TO MASTER 
McCulloch gazes with utter disbelief. 
MCCULLOCH Dear Christ... 
SEAN We have to get off this ship!! 
They back away from the horrid sight and begin to run, the Abandon Ship alarm still attacking their ears. 
EXT. LIFEBOAT STATIONS - NIGHT 
as McCulloch, Miss Van Deusen, Rennie and Sean scramble to the closest lifeboat. 
SEAN Everybody in -- I'll get the hoists 
McCulloch has no time for politeness, moving to the lifeboat ahead of the women. Rennie stops cold, gazing classy-eyed at the small boat. 
MISS VAN DEUSEN Come on, sweetheart -- get in... 
But she doesn't budge. McCulloch levels wild eyes on her, quickly climbing back down. 
MCCULLOCH Get in the boat, Rennie! 
RENNIE I...I can't... 
MCCULLOCH (shaking her) You can and you will!! 
He tries to slap her out of it, dragging her over to the boat, ignoring her terror-stricken frenzy. 
SEAN Stop it!! 
MISS VAN DEUSEN Leave her alone, Charles! 
Miss Van Deusen quickly moves to a hysterical Rennie and holds her, eyeing McCulloch vehemently. 
EXT. DECK - TIGHT ON DEAD DECK HAND - SAME TIME 
as rain begins to wash the blood from his back. JASON'S FOOT TRUDGES INTO FRAME...then his HAND REACHES DOWN, RETRIEVING HIS AXE FROM THE DECK HAND'S SPINE. 
EXT. LIFEBOAT STATIONS - SAME TIME 
as Rennie clings to	 Miss Van Deusen, crying. 
MISS VAN DEUSEN It's the only way, Rennie. Let's get in the boat now, okay? Please...for me? 
Rennie finds herself nodding. Miss Van Deusen helps the trembling girl up the steps, an angered McCulloch right behind. 
INT. LIFEBOAT - CONTINUOUS 
The water is less rough now, the rain replaced with fog. Julius has taken McCulloch's place behind an oar; McCulloch is flanking his shivering niece with Miss Van Deusen. 
MCCULLOCH (miserable) If we don't find the shore soon we're all going to die. 
Sean tries to ignore him, keeping his mind on rowing. 
MISS VAN DEUSEN (unable to hide fear) Do you know where we are, Sean? 
Sean pauses, utterly exhausted. He thinks for a moment, remembering his father's gift. Sean reaches into his coat pocket, removing the pocket navigational calculator. He stares at it long and hard. Julius looks over at him, seeing that Sean is on the verge of tears. He grips his shoulder. 
JULIUS Hey man, if I can make it, so can. you. 
Sean slowly nods, turning on the calculator. 
SLOW DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT (TANK) 
as the lifeboat rows into frame, the water relatively calm. 
INT. LIFEBOAT - NIGHT (TANK) 
McCulloch, Rennie and Miss Van Deusen are asleep, Sean and Julius rowing on sheer will power. Sean takes one more stroke, feels himself passing out, then regains his coherence again. Julius glances off the side of the ship for no particular reason, then does a doubletake. 
JULIUS' POINT OF VIEW (SECOND UNIT - N.Y.) 
They are rowing right past THE STATUE OF LIBERTY, illuminated in all its glory. 
INT. LIFEBOAT (TANK) 
Julius feels his eyes widening and a huge smile taking control of his haggard face. He tugs on Sean's sleeve, his eyes never leaving the monument. 
JULIUS Hey man, wake up! Check it out!! 
The other stir as well, opening their eyes, not sure if it's some kind of vision or if they are genuinely here. 
JULIUS God damn, we're in New York! You did it, my man!! 
Julius howls with delight, Miss Van Deusen hugging Rennie as Julius gives Sean the high-five. Toby barks. 
WIDE SHOT - NEW YORK HARBOR - NIGHT (SECOND UNIT - N.Y.) 
as the lifeboat rows toward the very famous skyline of Manhattan, twinkling in the near distance. We can hear the faint sound of Julius singing "New York, New York," relieved to be alive. They're going to make it. 
EXT. EMPTY OCEAN - ANOTHER ANGLE (TANK) 
as the sound of Julius' voice grows fainter. The water begins to ripple...then the top half of a HOCKEY MASK BREAKS THE SURFACE FOR A BREATH OF AIR, SINKING AGAIN. And swimming onward. 
EXT. CANNERY HARBOR - NIGHT 
as Julius and Sean row the lifeboat up to a narrow barge beneath deserted dock warehouses. They are not in the safest part of town by a longshot. 
CLOSER ANGLE 
as they climb onto the barge. Rennie breathes with relief as she steps off the boat. She takes a final glance back at it and sees: 
YOUNG RENNIE 
flailing her arms in the water right next to the lifeboat, drowning. 
YOUNG RENNIE Hhhhelp...me.... 
Suddenly a DECOMPOSED HAND REACHES UP FROM BELOW, GRABBING HER, DRAGGING HER UNDER. 
EXT. BARGE - ON RENNIE 
She gazes in utter shock, screaming: 
RENNIE No!!! 
They all follow her eyeline...but the water is calm, nothing there. 
MISS VAN DEUSEN (holding her) It's okay...you're safe now... 
McCulloch grits his teeth. 
MCCULLOCH Come on -- everybody up the ladder. 
He's the first one up. Sean looks at Rennie, concerned, then hoists Toby up in his arms. They all begin climbing the ladder. 
CLOSE ON LADDER - NIGHT 
as the last pair of feet disappear over the top edge of the dock. Camera PANS back down the rungs, finding the lifeboat and barge again. Suddenly JASON SPRINGS FROM THE WATER, CLIMBING ONTO THE BARGE. He gazes up at his new surroundings, quite different from all the years he's spent at Crystal Lake. But an item at the far end of the dock causes him the longest pause... 
JASON'S POINT OF VIEW 
A tattered billboard over one of the warehouses advertises the NEW YORK RANGERS HOCKEY TEAM, featuring a full shot of the HOCKEY-MASKED GOALIE. 
JASON 
looks at it long and hard. He tears off his life preserver wits renewed ambition. 
WIDE SHOT - BARGE AND DOCK WAREHOUSES - NIGHT 
as Jason heads up the ladder. He's about to take Manhattan. 
as a yellowish liquid squirts out the dirty needle. WIDEN to find Gang Banger #2 holding it with transfixed eyes, his compadre holding a squirming Rennie down on the couch, tearing back her jacket to reveal a bare arm. 
RENNIE Please don't... 
GANG BANGER #1 Loosen up, baby. It'll feel way better if you're stoned. 
CLOSE ON JASON'S FEET - SAME TIME 
Amongst the slime and cigarette butts is a discarded syringe. Jason picks it up. 
CLOSER ANGLE - COUCH 
just as Gang Banger #2 jabs Rennie with the needle. Gang Banger #1 wrestles off his torn leather jacket, pushing Rennie back on the exposed foam padding as his friend watches excitedly. 
GANG BANGER #1 Slang us some more 'caine, JoJo. We're in for a long night. 
Gang Banger #2 runs out the back way. #1 tears open Rennie's blouse, his filthy mouth moving to her neck. Rennie spits in his face. He hesitates not in SLAPPING HER HARD. 
GANG BANGER #1 It's your parade, princess. Can be smooth or can be rough. Your choice. 
She closes .her eyes, trying to blot out what's about to happen. 
GANG BANGER #1 I think I'm in love. 
PUSH IN on his face as his neck arches down, bringing his lips toward her chest. Just before contact he GRUNTS THICKLY, HIS EYES BUGGING OUT. 
WIDER ANGLE 
Jason is standing right behind him, shoving something into his back, out of frame. He thrusts it again, bringing with it one more horrific grunt from the kid. Jason goes for number three and: 
CLOSE UP - GANG BANGER #1'S CHEST (EFX) 
Jason's syringe gets shoved completely through him, the needle sticking out his front side. 
RENNIE 
opens her eyes, looking into the dead boy's face as blood drips from his mouth. He collapses in front of her, giving way to a view of JASON TOWERING OVER HER. At the same time: 
GANG BANGER #2 
comes around the corner. 
GANG BANGER #2 Forgot my money, holmes... 
Ha stops dead in his tracks at the sight of Jason. 
GANG BANGER #2 Who the fuck are you? 
Jason paces toward him. The kid glances at his dead friend arched over the couch, quickly whipping out his 
GANG BANGER #2 You're dead, fuckhead. 
BANG! 
...but Jason keeps on coming. Five shots later and Jason's still standing, easily picking up the slime ball and SHOVING HIM HEAD FIRST INTO THE MOSSY BRICK WALL. The kid falls in a bloody heap. 
RENNIE 
shoves Gang Banger #1 off of her as Jason returns his attention to her. She grabs a loose brick and FLINGS IT AT HIM, CRACKING HIS HOCKEY MASK, momentarily disorienting him. Rennie sprints away. 
EXT. ALLEY #1 - NIGHT (LONG LENS) 
as Julius runs into view, looking down a menacing alley, spotting a phone booth. He hurries for it. 
PREDATOR'S POINT OF VIEW 
Like a cat watching a bird, we watch Julius head for the booth. 
JULIUS 
slams open the booth door, grabbing the receiver, punching the "operator" digit. SLOWLY PUSH IN on him as he waits for an answer. Several more rings. 
JULIUS C'mon... 
Finally a click and muffled words from the operator. 
JULIUS Get me the police -- this is an emergency... 
SMASH! as JASON'S FIST CRASHES THROUGH THE BOOTH WINDOW, GRABBING JULIUS BY THE THROAT. Julius grips Jason's scaly arm with all his strength, staring at the cracked hockey mask framed in the shattered window. Julius summons all his strength, tearing free of Jason's grasp and running out the door. The phone is left dangling. 
RUNNING WITH JULIUS (HAND HELD) 
with no apparent direction. Literally running for his life. 
TRACKING WITH JASON 
He's just as quick, but smoother and more methodical. 
JULIUS' POINT OF VIEW (HAND HELD) 
heading up the alley, spotting a fire escape, diverting his course straight for it. 
ANGLE - FIRE ESCAPE 
as Julius LEAPS ONTO IT, dragging himself up, climbing as fast as is humanly possible. 
MCCULLOCH (stewing) Yes. 
IRISH COP Who is...Jason? 
MCCULLOCH He's a walking corpse, a phantasm from hell. 
The others stare at McCulloch angrily. Miss Van Deusen turns to the confused policeman. 
MISS VAN DEUSEN I'm afraid you'll have some trouble believing us. 
IRISH COP So try me. 
EXT. SQUAD CAR - NIGHT 
parked above the abandoned garage, the interior dark. The Cop and our heroes appear in the background, coming towards it. 
IRISH COP You're right -- I find it a tall tale indeed. But you seem like honest folks so I'm inclined to believe at least some of it. 
MISS VAN DEUSEN (relieved) Thank you. The first thing we' have to do is find Julius. 
IRISH COP I'm sure he'll pop up soon enough. Why don't you climb in the back while I radio for backup. 
ADJUST INTO A FULL SHOT OF THE BACK DOOR AS HE SWINGS IT OPEN...but even in this darkness, we see that it's empty. They climb in. The Cop opens his drivers door, and... 
INSERT - DOME LIGHT (SECOND UNIT) 
The car dome light blinks on, and... 
ANGLE - BACK SEAT 
Our four survivors' faces are brightly illuminated, INSTANTLY CHANGING TO GASPS AND SCREAMS because: 
THEIR POINT OF VIEW (EFX) 
Julius' severed head is resting on the dash board, staring back at them!!! 
ANGLE - COP 
reacting to their terror, seeing Julius' head, quickly grabbing the radio mike. But he has no time for a message because JASON REACHES UP FROM THE PARKING LOT PIT BELOW, GRABBING THE COP'S ANKLE, DRAGGING HIM DOWN. The radio is still in his grasp. 
INSERT - DISPATCH RADIO (SECOND UNIT) 
as the radio cord grows taut, finally snapping. The Irish cop's awful yell echoes over it, silencing after a sick THUD. 
INT. SQUAD CAR - CONTINUOUS 
The foursome instantly try to flee the car, but police cars have no door handles in the back. 
SEAN There aren't any handles!! 
Cocaine flowing through her veins, Rennie acts hyperkinetically, scratching her way over the seats just as: 
JASON 
appears at the parking lot stairs, STALKING STRAIGHT TOWARDS THE CAR. 
INT. SQUAD CAR - CONTINUOUS 
There is no time for escape. Rennie finds the ignition and fires it up, jamming it into drive and STOMPING ON THE ACCELERATOR. Julius' head rolls off the dash, onto the floorboards. 
RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (POST EFX) 
Her vision is still a stoned one but clear enough to set her target. We come straight at the abominable creature and: 
WHAM! (EFX) 
Jason is mowed down. 
RENNIE 
slams on the brakes, jerks it into reverse and FLOORS IT AGAIN. 
CLOSE ON JASON (EFX) 
as the automobile grinds back over him a second time. 
RENNIE 
stomps on the brake pedal and the tires SCREECH TO A HALT. They all take a moment to catch their breath, looking out the front window... 
THEIR POINT OF VIEW 
Jason lies dead on the asphalt. For about two seconds. He SLOWLY STANDS. 
RENNIE 
desperately throws it into forward again, gripping the wheel and RACING FORWARD. 
POINT OF VIEW FROM FRONT BUMPER (STUNT DRIVE) 
Jason's standing there for one second, but the next moment he is LEAPING OUT OF THE WAY... 
EXT. ABANDONED PARKING LOT (STUNT DRIVE) 
...and the squad car SMASHES THROUGH A CHAIN LINK FENCE, FREEFALLING TO THE ABANDONED PARKING LOT BELOW. 
She's instantly tense. 
MCCULLOCH He never learned how either and he's still at the bottom of this lake. 
YOUNG RENNIE He is not. 
MCCULLOCH Oh, he is indeed. And ready to pull down anybody who falls in and can't swim. 
YOUNG RENNIE You're telling a lie. 
MCCULLOCH Am I? Let's find out. 
...And quicker than she's able to react to it, MCCULLOCH PUSHES HER OVERBOARD. 
SPLASH! 
as Rennie's body violently disrupts the calm surface. She immediately begins to flounder. McCulloch calmly leans over the edge. 
MCCULLOCH Better swim before Jason drags you down, Rennie. Come on, you can do it... 
...but Rennie thrashes in the water, struggling to keep from sinking under the surface. 
RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW 
Her uncle's face blurs and clears as water splashes her eyes. 
YOUNG RENNIE I...I can't... 
MCCULLOCH You can and you will! Swim, Rennie! 
RENNIE 
is too panicked to obey. 
YOUNG RENNIE Hhhhelp...me.... 
She coughs on some water then disappears... 
UNDERWATER (TANK) 
The world above her ceases to exist, murky lake water taking over. Rennie looks-down, and to her horror... 
RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (TANK) 
Young Jason is grabbing her ankle and dragging her down. The whole image BURSTS INTO FLAMES and we: 
DISSOLVE BACK TO: 
EXT. ASPHALT - NIGHT 
as the gasoline continues to burn, the rowboat gone. ADJUST to find RENNIE'S FACE, the flames of the car wreckage flickering over her glassy eyes. She looks up at Miss Van Deusen's body one last time before: 
ANGLE - SQUAD CAR (EFX) 
The auto's fuel tank EXPLODES, SHRAPNEL FLYING EVERYWHERE. 
EXT. ALLEY #4 - CONTINUOUS 
She looks up at her uncle with knowing eyes. Eyes that tell him she's remembered everything. 
RENNIE You pushed me... 
MCCULLOCH (defensively) I was only trying to teach you. But I pulled you out, Rennie. I saved your life. 
Rennie just stares, incredulous. 
SEAN You son of a bitch... 
She lets it build until she's ready to explode...then: 
RENNIE He was down there!!! 
And Rennie runs off. McCulloch starts to follow but Sean grabs him, shoving him down. 
SEAN You keep away from her! 
Sean chases after Rennie. Camera methodically PANS BACK TO MCCULLOCH, crumpled on the ground. A very bitter man. He wipes his hands, getting ready to stand when THE SHADOW FALLS OVER HIM. His skin fades to porcelain white. 
MCCULLOCH You...are...NOT POSSIBLE. 
But possible, and actual, he is. A PAIR OF ROTTED ARMS EXTEND DOWN, RIPPING HIM OUT OF FRAME. 
TRACKING WITH JASON 
as the walking corpse lifts a screaming McCulloch over his head, carrying him over to one of the scum-filled OIL DRUMS, SHOVING HIM HEAD-FIRST INTO IT. Jason grips McCulloch's thrashing legs as bubbles rise to the surface of the slime, a pathetic gurgling reverberating out the drum. At last McCulloch's appendages go limp. Jason releases him, moving on. 
EXT. ALLEY #5 - NIGHT 
as Sean runs into view, glancing around, spotting Rennie, crouched against a crumbled brick wall. No tears...only hate. Sean sits down next to her. After several moments... 
RENNIE I was at school when they told me. 'Rennie, we have some very bad news... your parents have been killed in an auto accident.' 
Sean gently takes her hand, sharing her internal agony. 
RENNIE It seems like everybody I care about ends up... 
INSERT - TRAIN CONSOLE 
as the Engineer's arm KNOCKS THE THROTTLE FORWARD... 
EXT. SUBWAY STATION - CONTINUOUS (N.Y.) 
...and the train begins to move, racing into the black tunnel. 
INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - NIGHT (N.Y.) 
as Rennie and Sean run for their lives, arriving at the end of a car, jamming the separating doors open and entering the next car. Jason follows right behind. 
INT. SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT (N.Y.) 
as the train thunders through the station without stopping, baffling several waiting COMMUTERS. 
INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - JASON'S POINT OF VIEW (N.Y.) 
--seeing Sean and Rennie disappear through another connecting door. We storm our way through it into the next car right after them. A handful of TRAVELERS cower away from us. 
INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NIGHT (N.Y.) 
as the train rapidly speeds past us, showing no signs of slowing down. 
INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - FINAL CAR (N.Y.) 
as Sean and Rennie come through another set of separating doors, rushing through... finding they're in the last car. They look back, seeing Jason enter at the opposite end. The monster stalks forward. Sean's eyes dart around. He spots the EMERGENCY STOP CORD. HE LEAPS FOR IT. 
EXT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NIGHT (N.Y.) 
...and the train SCREECHES TO A HALT. 
INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - CONTINUOUS (N.Y.) 
The sudden stop throws Jason on his back. Sean throws the rear door open, jumping out with Rennie. 
INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NIGHT (N.Y.) 
as Sean and Rennie sprint down the center of the tracks toward the light of the next station, running out of strength. 
INT. TIMES SQUARE STATION - NIGHT (N.Y.) 
as they emerge from the darkness, up to the edge of the pit. Sean boosts Rennie up, starting to climb up himself when: 
JASON 
fires out from the tunnel, grabbing onto Sean's ankle. Rennie screams as Sean is dragged down...but he manages to latch onto a chain securing a garbage receptacle. Jason pulls harder, stretching Sean to his limit as Rennie watches helplessly. 
RENNIE NO!!! 
RENNIE 
runs straight towards the track pit like a football punter, RECOILING WITH HER RIGHT LEG, KICKING JASON SQUARELY IN THE FACE. 
JASON (EFX) 
trips backwards and LANDS ON THE THIRD, ELECTRIFIED RAIL, RECEIVING TEN THOUSAND VOLTS. His body smokes and convulses, finally sizzling out. He appears to be terminated!!! 
ANGLE - SEAN AND RENNIE 
as they get to their feet, holding each other tight, looking down on the now-dead undead creature. 
EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT (N.Y.) (CRANE SHOT) 
as our heroes arise into the neon-filled big city wonderland, relieved to be alive, gazing around at the awesome spectacle known as Times Square. A huge DIGITAL CLOCK tells us it's a quarter to midnight. Sean wraps his arm around her. 
SEAN It's over, Rennie. It's finally over. 
Camera RISES ABOVE THEM, RACKING BACK TO THE SUBWAY EXIT. Guess who has just made an encore...with more energy than ever!!! 
SEAN AND RENNIE 
look all around them, having never been to a city as big as this. They finally turn far enough around to spot JASON in a series of three quick cuts, each one closer than the last. 
SEAN God...please no... 
But Jason keeps on coming. 
RENNIE Somebody help us!! He's going to kill us!!! 
But the heavy Times Square foot traffic ignores her, bustling onward. Rennie and Sean have no choice but to flee again. 
JASON 
shoves his way through the preoccupied pedestrians; they've certainly seen weirder characters than him here. He moves past a group of STREET URCHINS listening to some rap from their ghetto blaster. His foot obliterates their stereo system with one stride. They instantly pull out switchblades and chains. 
STREET URCHIN You're dead meat, slime bag. 
Jason stops, turning around, towering over the kids. He has blood and gore caked everywhere, his skin charred from the electrocution. Jason starts to remove his mask, facing them squarely. 
TIGHT ON STREET URCHINS 
as Jason's mask comes off out-of-frame. Their tough faces turn to putty, scared completely shitless. 
STREET URCHIN Hey man, it's cool, it's cool...

PRINCE OF THIEVES 
FADE IN: 
SUNSET The glowing orb ripples like a blood-red eye. 
BLACK, ROBED FIGURE A face of the ages. Dark, wrinkled skin. Wizened, almond eyes. He howls at the sun. His voice ECHOES across the sky. The Moslem call to prayer. Hundreds of feet below his tower, a mud-walled city of minarets and mosques. A human ants' nest. Scurrying to their devotions. 
EXT. TWELFTH-CENTURY ARAB CITY - ESTABLISHING SHOT 
INT. DUNGEONS - SUNSET Pervasive blackness. Moans of men in pain. Dripping water. Rats. Filth. The nadir of human degradation. Bedraggled white men, POWs from the Crusades, caged together with Arab cutthroats. Jailers wrench two crusaders from their cell. ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY and PETER DUBOIS. Their appearance reeks of long imprisonment, but remnants of their noble heritage still glimmer in their faces. Peter is so frail he can barely walk. 
EXT. ARAB STREET - NIGHT Robin's head appears... ducks back down, as a squad of mounted soldiers thunders right over him... he reappears. All clear. They're outside the prison wall. Robin helps Peter up. ROBIN God willing, we may now be safe. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Swoosh. An arrow pierces through Peter's chest -- fired from the prison wall. He reels... Robin leads him under the wall for protection. Shouts of alarm. Soldiers approaching. ROBIN Come, Peter.    We must hurry. Raising his sword, Peter faces the oncoming soldiers. PETER It is mortal.    Leave me. ROBIN Hold on to my shoulder. 
Peter shakes him off. PETER My mother... my little sister. Tell them I love them. Tell them I died a free Englishman. Robin looks despairingly to the Saracen. SARACEN His wound is by the heart.    We cannot save him. Robin knows it's true. Peter pulls an insignia ring from a hidden pouch in his clothes. Thrusts it into Robin's hand. PETER Take this to my sister. Swear you will protect her for me... Swear it, Robin! ROBIN (reluctantly) I swear it. Summoning hidden resources of strength, Peter charges at the oncoming soldiers, brandishing his sword. PETER For England. He fells the first Arab.   The Saracen pulls Robin away. SARACEN Come now! Do not fail your friend. Make his sacrifice an act of honor. They vanish into the night. Fighting like a man pos- sessed, Peter is swallowed in a sea of enemy soldiers. 
DESERTED ALLEY - LATER Robin and the Saracen catch their breath. ROBIN Farewell, friend. God speed you on your way. SARACEN Our way is together. With the speed of Allah. He grins.    This strange man has a sense of humor. ROBIN I go to England. 
SARACEN Then I go to England. ROBIN England?   Why? SARACEN You saved my life. I must stay with you until I save yours. ROBIN Go your own way. I relieve you of your obligation. SARACEN Only Allah can do that. ROBIN And if I don't want you? SARACEN You have no choice... unless you think you can kill me. He grins broadly.      Offers his hand. SARACEN My name is Aslan. Resigned, Robin takes the proferred hand. ROBIN Robin of Locksley. You know a short route to England, Aslan? CUT TO: 
EXT. LOCKSLEY CASTLE (NOTTINGHAMSHIRE, ENGLAND) Eerie shapes. Weaving. White light on water. The moon reflected in the moat of a small castle. Towers shrouded in night mist. Smoke curls from a chimney. SUPERIMPOSE:   LOCKSLEY CASTLE, NOTTINGHAMSHIRE, ENGLAND 
INT. LOCKSLEY CASTLE - NIGHT FIRE CRACKLES in an open hearth. Hams and a half sheep hang, smoking. An old DOG SNORES at the fireside. A bone clunks on the floor, waking him. VOICE (O.S.) Enough of that din, Remus.    I can't think. Licking the bone gratefully, the dog looks in the direc- tion of the voice... Grey. Proud. Distinguished. LORD LOCKSLEY. Seated at a table, wine goblet in hand, he pores   over a wonderful illustrated Bible. Reading to himself    for solace and strength. Empty chairs surround the    vast table. A deep sense of loneliness. He glances     at a portrait over the fireplace... Robin. The dog jumps. Hackles rise. O.S. SHOUTS. Locksley unsheathes a dagger. Obscures it in the folds of the Bible. The door bursts open. A peasant, ragged, desperate, KENNETH. KENNETH My Lord!   Help me. He's bleeding from a face wound. Another man grabs him from behind. Locksley's craggy-faced retainer, DUNCAN. Older than his master, but still strong, he holds Kenneth back. DUNCAN You must wait... I am sorry you were disturbed, Master. KENNETH (high anxiety) My Lord, please! LOCKSLEY It is alright, Duncan. (to Kenneth) You are Kenneth of Cowfall? The peasant falls to his knees. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: KENNETH They've taken my Gwen.    My daughter. LOCKSLEY Who has taken her? KENNETH Men on horses. In masks. (touches his wound) We tried to stop them. My son is dead. 
EXT. LOCKSLEY CASTLE - NIGHT 
ROBIN My friend, you have escorted me home. I beg you to free yourself of your vow. Return with the boat. I know how heavy your heart must be, this far from your family and native land... ASLAN (SARACEN) Because I love them so dearly, I cannot dishonor them. A sailor creeps up behind Aslan, club in hand. ROBIN I thought you'd say that. He nods to the sailor, who swings the club down. The Saracen sidesteps, grabs the man's arm and flips him into the surf. He turns a cold stare on Robin. 
ASLAN No man controls my destiny. Especially not one who attacks downwind and stinks of garlic. Robin laughs.    The Saracen remains intense. ASLAN If our positions were reversed, I would have done the same. Only I would have succeeded. He smiles broadly.    Robin claps him on the shoulder. ROBIN Come, Aslan. By nightfall we will celebrate your honor when we dine with my father. 
EXT./INT. PEASANT'S COTTAGE - DAY CRASH! An armored foot splinters the door of a farmer's hovel. Children scream and run. A soldier clubs at them, laughing. Outside. More soldiers. Some on horses, others on foot, with leashed hounds. Pillaging. Vandalizing. Searching. GUY GISBORNE: An impressive figure on horseback. Strikingly handsome -- except that one of his ears is missing. We recognize his face from the Druid ceremony. He coldly addresses a pregnant woman with a child in her arms, FANNY. GISBORNE You owe the sheriff three bushels of flax. FANNY You starve us. First the drought, now you take what food we have left. GISBORNE For starving people, you look fat enough. SOLDIER (emerging from the hut) He's not here, sir. None but the woman and children. GISBORNE (to Fanny) Where is your mate? The man they call Little. FANNY He died last winter. GISBORNE Is that so? We hear he     is very much alive. Hiding out     in the forest. He probably ran     away to escape your scolding    tongue. The soldiers join in his laughter. Incensed, Fanny pounds her fist on his legs. Gisborne kicks her down. FANNY Norman swine! A BOY of 12 springs from nowhere, thrusting a hay fork at Gisborne's throat. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: FANNY No, Wulf! Don't! 'Twill only make it worse. Wulf backs off.   Nostrils flaring with repressed hate. GISBORNE Seize him! While two soldiers grab the Boy, others examine his hiding place. A secret thatched door, built into the side of a haystack... a bow and quiver... and a deer carcass. Gisborne dismounts. GISBORNE This is Lord Nottingham's deer. Is this how you repay the Sheriff for his protection? WULF (BOY) Like a wolf protects sheep. FANNY I killed it.   We needed the meat. GISBORNE Poachers hang. Either he dies or you die. WULF My mother lies to protect me. FANNY No, Wulf! Gisborne drags the boy to the carcass. 
GISBORNE You have deprived us of a hunt, boy. He cups his hand in the deer's blood.    Smears it on Wulf's face. GISBORNE The hounds know the scent well. He tosses his bloody glove to the dogs. They tear at each other in their effort to rip at the glove. GISBORNE Run, boy. Like a deer. Give us some pleasure before you die. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: To the accompaniment of the HOUNDS' savage HOWLS and the horrified screams of his family, Wulf runs. GISBORNE Unleash them! 
EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DUSK Nearing home, Robin is buoyant.     The Saracen, brooding, walks two paces behind him. ROBIN Why must you walk in back of me? 
ASLAN In your land am I not the infidel? The unbeliever, the instrument of evil? ROBIN Our races have fought for a hundred years to prove that point. ASLAN Then I trust it is safer to appear as your slave than as your equal. ROBIN For an 'infidel' you have uncommon clarity of thinking. Yet you refuse to tell me about your home and family. ASLAN Those are my burdens. 
ROBIN You speak my language. You have the diplomacy and honor code of a nobleman. I ask again, why were you to be executed? The Saracen maintains a moody silence. ROBIN So, I must continue with my guesswork. You are highborn? Probably... You fell from favor... Clearly... Why? You broke the law? You were a rival for power? ... A woman? (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: DUNCAN Lord, no! He chokes in shock.   Spitting bread. ASLAN Lord, yes. But eat in peace. I take no offense. (glances at Robin) By the prophet! What is the man doing? Robin raises his dagger over his wrist.   Aslan runs to him. 
ASLAN Wait! Too late. Robin slashes the dagger across his palm. Rain and blood mingle. Streaming onto the grave. ROBIN I swear by my own blood. I will not rest until I have restored my father's name. (a whisper) ... Or until I am dead. 
EXT. FOREST PATH - DAY Ooze sucks at feet.   The three men stomp through mud and rain. ROBIN We make a fine army, do we not, Duncan? A blind man, an Arab, and a fool. ASLAN A fine, wet army. I have never witnessed a storm of such duration. When does summer come to this land? ROBIN This is summer. ASLAN Then Allah truly is great. ROBIN Why, pray? (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: ASLAN No food, no shelter,   and weather that would curse the   end of the earth. We  will all   quickly be dead, and I shall be   rid of my vow. They approach a stone wall, surrounding a thatched mansion. ROBIN You despair too soon, Aslan. We shall find food and shelter here among friends. 
ASLAN What is this place? ROBIN Peter's home. It is nearly seven years since we left here together. 
EXT. DUBOIS MANSION - DAY Robin pounds on the door.    A hatch opens.     An OLD WOMAN's face. OLD WOMAN No beggars! The hatch slams shut.    Robin pounds again. ROBIN Open up! 
A pause.   The hatch slides back. ROBIN Tell the mistress of the house that Robin of Locksley is at her door. OLD WOMAN Her ladyship is not at home. She slams the hatch again.    Robin jams in his hand. ROBIN Aagh! He shouts through the hatch, over his bruised fingers. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: ROBIN Is the child Marian at home? OLD WOMAN Maybe she is. Maybe she isn't. Remove that hand. Robin refuses. She waits imperiously behind the locked door. Robin reluctantly withdraws his hand. Instantly the hatch slams. ASLAN The hospitality here is as warm as the weather. 
They wait, shivering... The door opens a crack. OLD WOMAN Leave your weapons. The three start forward.       Her bony finger points at Robin. OLD WOMAN Just you. 
MARIAN I will forward your condolences to my mother. She turns her back.   He searches for a way to reach her. ROBIN On my return, I found my father dead. The Sheriff denounced him as a Druid and took our lands. MARIAN The people fear the Druids so much they'd believe anything. Nottingham would have me burned at the stake as a witch if he thought he could possess my property. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: ROBIN Why do you not join your mother in London? You would be safer there. MARIAN I will not retreat.     Besides, I have no interest in    life at court. Gossip-mongering and    currying favor. Here I am my     own person. ROBIN The you must allow me to be your guardian. 
MARIAN I do not need a guardian. She turns to face him.   Streaming tears. MARIAN My brother is dead. You cannot take his place. Robin grabs and holds her. ROBIN Marian, I don't want to replace him. MARIAN What do you want? Their eyes meet... a sudden intimacy between them. Robin moves closer. Marian begins to respond, then pulls away. 
MARIAN This is wrong. She runs back to the house. Robin stares after her. Aslan appears in the doorway with Duncan. ASLAN Robin! The old man hears horses. Approaching fast. He runs to a bluff... a column of soldiers snakes up the hillside. ASLAN Twenty or more. In battle armor. MARIAN Soldiers coming here?     Is this your protection? (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: ROBIN I killed some of the Sheriff's men. I fear I have placed you in danger. MARIAN I can take care of myself. There are horses in the stable. Go! Aslan runs into the stables. ROBIN I'm not leaving. Marian ices him with a glare. Aslan reappears, with two bareback horses. Soldiers appear on the crest, led by Gisborne... With a mischievous grin, Marian runs to the soldiers. MARIAN Stop them!   They're stealing my horses! ROBIN Damn the girl! Aslan, can you ride? In answer, Aslan grins. Leaps onto a horse. With a single swift move he hoists Duncan up behind him and digs in his heels. The mare leaps forward, and over the estate wall. ROBIN He can ride. He heads his horse at the wall. It stumbles. Barely clears it. Stones fly. Robin struggles to hold on. Marian stands directly in Gisborne's path. GISBORNE You have been sheltering outlaws, Lady Marian. MARIAN They're thieves, you imbecile. Bring back my horses, or the Sheriff will know of your cowardice. Gisborne knows she is lying. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: GISBORNE You're lucky he didn't steal your virtue too. (to his men) A crown to the man who brings me Locksley's head. He leads the pursuit.   A SOLDIER hangs back.   Grabs Marian's hair. SOLDIER A kiss for me, Saxon bitch. MARIAN Kiss this! 
She unsheathes the dagger from under her skirt.    Jabs the blade into his wrist. MARIAN Try me again, if you want to leave a hand behind. Shocked and pained, the man gallops away. Marian looks down at her dagger hand. It shakes violently. CUT TO: EXT. STREAM Water erupts under hooves. Aslan fords a stream. Duncan hangs on for dear life. Robin strives to keep up. Half a mile behind Gisborne splits up his men. Trying for a short cut, Robin finds himself at the steepest part of the river gorge. His horse balks at the drop. Robin flails at his mount with hands and feet. It backs away. ROBIN Damn you, animal! Aslan shouts from the far bank. ASLAN Treat it like a woman. Robin continues to hit his horse and hurl abuse. Closing in, the soldiers unfurl their crossbows. A flight of BOLTS WHISTLES ominously close to Robin. He must jump or die. ASLAN Have you never had a woman? Gently, man. Soothe it! (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: ROBIN Of course I've had a woman! Come on, pretty one. He pats the horse soothingly.    The animal edges forward. ASLAN Softly.   With your knees. ROBIN I know!   I know! The soldiers reload.   Robin urges the horse at the steep drop. 
ROBIN Easy, easy. Another wave of crossbow bolts. Robin launches the frightened animal into space. Hooves flail... touch down. Scramble up the other bank. Robin enthusiastically pats the horse's neck. ROBIN I love you! The first two pursuers misjudge their leaps.     Their mounts land sprawling in the riverbed. GISBORNE (yelling) Robin of the Hood! Son of the devil worshipper. ROBIN What is your pleasure, Gisborne? 
CONTINUED: ROBIN Be quiet!    Listen. WIND GUSTS the trees in angry waves. Emits deathly SHRIEKS. The HORSES WHINNEY. Unnerved, Aslan smites around him with his scimitar. Wheels at the sounds, striking only air. ASLAN Allah protect us from the evil spirits. Duncan clings to his back.   Robin points. ROBIN Behind you! Aslan slashes out, futilely. ROBIN No, there!    And there! Aslan flails.   Robin cracks up. ASLAN Cease your mad laughing.     I can feel them. Robin reaches into the branches. Pulls out a string of hollowed wooden tubes -- WINDCHIMES. Dozens of such strings on all the trees. He blows over the hollow end. A low chilling MOAN. ROBIN Here are your ghosts, Duncan. A child's toy put to good use. You scare easily, my painted Saladin. His laughter is broken by a piercing YELL. A red- jacketed figure swings down out of a tree on a rope. Catapults him to the ground. The bushes are instantly alive. Shaggy, wild-eyed men, armed with cudgels, scythes and hayforks. Twelfth- century Hell's Angels. The red-jacketed young turk, WILL SCARLET, leaps around Robin. WILL SCARLET (singing) Ring around the rosie! ROBIN Aslan! Aslan makes no move to intervene. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: The woodsmen eye the bizarre stranger, keeping their distance from him. Will kicks at Robin, who tries to grab him. Will skips out of range. Robin falls. WILL SCARLET Atishoo, Atishoo. We all fall down. Beg for mercy, rich man. ROBIN I beg of no man. Which of you scum has guts enough to face me man to man? VOICE (O.S.) Yeah, bollocks, mate. 
Robin looks up... I mean up! A towering figure. Seven feet of grinning, muscled brute. The giant extends a vice that passes for a hand. Hauls Robin to his feet. His eyes twinkle with merriment. His whole body shakes when he laughs, which is often. JOHN LITTLE What are ya, m'old cock? ROBIN Er... Robin... He pauses, checking the faces of the angry peasants. ROBIN ...Hood.   Robin Hood.   Who are you? JOHN LITTLE John Little.   Bestman o' the woods. ROBIN Bestman?   You lead this rabble? WILL SCARLET We waste time. Tax him. ROBIN Tax?   For what? WILL SCARLET For passage through Sherwood. ROBIN I will pay no tax. Besides, I have nothing but my cloak and my sword. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: WILL SCARLET A man who travels with two servants and claims he's without money, is either a fool or a liar. Grabbing Robin, Little shakes him like a doll. Something CLINKS. Robin's father's medallion. Laughing heartily, Little rips it from Robin's neck and tosses it to Scarlet. WILL SCARLET And this one is a liar. (he bites the metal) Ahah! Gold! The men cheer.   John snatches the medallion back from Will. ROBIN That is sacred to me. JOHN LITTLE Sacred to us too, mush. This here'll feed us for a bloomin' month. Robin draws his sword. ROBIN You will have to fight me for it. JOHN LITTLE I'd love to, mate. He grins hugely.   A boy pushes his way through the throng. WULF Wait, father!    I know him. ROBIN This man is your father? Tell him how I saved your hide from the Sheriff's soldiers. That deserves some gratitude, I believe. He reaches for the medallion.    John pulls it away. JOHN LITTLE Naw ya don't, laddie. WILL SCARLET You must be Robin of Locksley. The blackguard who abandoned us to Nottingham's plundering. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: WULF Be careful, Father. He fights like a demon. He walloped six o' Sheriff's men? JOHN LITTLE Is that so? Another grin. Licking his lips in anticipation, he lunges for Robin's wrist. Wrenches the sword free. Bends it into a pretzel. ROBIN Aslan! 
Aslan shrugs. Robin swings a fist into the giant's gut. John doesn't flinch. Hoists Robin off the ground with one arm. Cannonballs the other fist into Robin's stomach. Robin folds. WILL SCARLET Oh dear! The little rich boy is lost for words. Thanks for the taxes, Locksley. JOHN LITTLE And for the laughs. The woodsmen find this hysterical. They disappear into the tree. Will administers one final kick before leaving. Robin staggers to his feet. Glares furiously at Aslan. ROBIN Son of an Arab whore! Once again your assistance was invaluable. 
ASLAN You seemed more in danger of losing your pride than your life. DUNCAN I recognized some of the voices. Many were from your father's farms. ASLAN Your avenging army, my friend. ROBIN That rabble? ASLAN All they need is a leader. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: ROBIN They have a leader.   A very large one. ASLAN Defeat him and they will follow you. ROBIN Allah has taken your brains. DUNCAN I hear the voice of a spoiled child, Master Robin. I suggest you cease your brave talk of revenge and flee to the north. ROBIN You, too? You expect me to fight that behemoth? DUNCAN Your father would expect you to act like a man. CUT TO: EXT. FOREST CLEARING - DAY A large tree trunk spans a swift-flowing river. The ragged band of woodsmen approach the makeshift bridge. Stop in their tracks. Robin stands on the bridge, brandishing a long wooden staff. ROBIN This is my bridge. No one crosses without paying tax. JOHN LITTLE Just bugger off, mate, huh? ROBIN If you wish to cross, it will cost you a gold medallion. JOHN LITTLE Ain't I hurt you a bloody nuff for one day? WILL SCARLET If he's in a hurry to end his mortal misery, help him. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: ROBIN You don't have the courage to face me again, John Little? Or should I call you 'Little John'? John grabs a hefty, gnarled staff.   Strides to the bridge. JOHN LITTLE Alright, m'old cock. You wanna nuther good wallopin'? His confidence melting, Robin glances back at Duncan and Aslan, who grins like a fan at a boxing match. John storms at Robin. Staffs thrash. Driven back, Robin connects a blow on John's foot. The giant is off-balance. Robin follows up. Lands a couple to the ribs. John responds with heavy swings, which Robin blocks deftly. Back and forth, blow for blow, all blocked. John chuckles with every swing. Enjoying the time of his life. Their staffs lock. It's strength against strength. Robin is no match. With one mighty thrust, John hurtles him into the stream. The woodsmen cheer loudly. Aslan watches impassively. Robin scrambles back onto the bridge.   John waits, grinning. JOHN LITTLE Lil' wet behind the ears, mate? WILL SCARLET Don't fool with him. Get him! 
ROBIN He is right to distrust me. I am a rich man's son. I have done no honest labor. But today I am as poor as any of you. Nottingham has stolen all that I own. And when I killed Gisborne's men, I, too, became an outlaw. LITTLE JOHN Ya're full o'bloody wind an' all, mate. This 'ere load o' rubbish agin the Sheriff's bloomin' army? Ya must be bloody jokin'. ROBIN We can win.   And I believe we will. LITTLE JOHN Ya're a daft bugger, Robin Hood, but ya're a brave 'un, I'll give ya that. Drink up, laddie, cuz tomorrow ya mayn't be so lucky! Tomorrow I shall best ya an' crack that blasted noble head in two. Laughing loudly, he throws back his head for a long draught of mead. 
EXT. WOODSMEN'S CAMP - SUNRISE A steady trickle of RAIN drips from leaves onto the nose of the sleeping Saracen. He wakes, cursing. All around him the woodsmen lie on the forest floor, covered with rags and hides coughing and sneezing. A sorry mess. Robin sits, brooding. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: ASLAN (gloomily) I have led you wrong. This is no army. These men live like dogs. ROBIN English dogs.    They can learn. ASLAN Learn what?   To build kennels? He sullenly stalks away. Robin shakes his head. Aslan is right. He rouses Duncan, who is asleep at his side. The old man groans awake, holding his head. Seriously hung-over. 
ROBIN Too much mead, old friend.    What day is it? DUNCAN Sunday, I believe. ROBIN Good. Do they still give alms to the poor at the mass? DUNCAN They do. These days the need for mercy is greater than ever. ROBIN Then I must ask you a favor. EXT. ROAD TO NOTTINGHAM - DAY 
Duncan walks alone, with the aid of his staff. Body stooped, clothes ragged, a pathetic figure. Ahead is the main gate to the walled city of Nottingham. Fresh horse manure. A man's hand reaches into it and spreads it over his clothes. And his face -- Robin, dressed as Duncan. 
EXT. CITY GATE - DAY Robin taps his way through the crowd. Past the piercing stare of the armored GUARD at the gate. GUARD Hey, you! Robin keeps going.   A hand clasps his shoulder.    Spins him 'round. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: GUARD Do I know you? Robin gazes into space, trying to look blind.   The Guard sniffs his soiled hand. GUARD My God, you stink! ROBIN Pardon my blindness, sir.    I'm always falling down. GUARD Yeech!   Get away from me. 
He launches a kick in Robin's rear. Robin hobbles away, hiding a smile. The Guard tries to wipe off his hand on the wall. 
INT. NOTTINGHAM CATHEDRAL - DAY Jesus hangs from the cross. A magnificent stained glass window. In the ornate pulpit, the BISHOP OF HEREFORD, bedecked in ermine. BISHOP We beseech thy blessing, Lord, on all your people, but most especially on our noble Lord Nottingham. Grant him the wisdom to guide and protect our glorious city. Nottingham and Gisborne sit piously among the congrega- tion of nobles and wealthy merchants. BISHOP Grant him also the strength to bring to justice the lawless men who threaten its safety. Help him to stamp out the curse of the dread Druids who would seize from us our children, even as wolves steal the lambs from their mothers. The rear of the church. Standing crushed together, the poor and afflicted. Old and young. Starving children. Among them, Robin. The sermon ends. As the nobles file out, the poor are galvanized. Begging hands reach out. (CONTINUED) 
Robin runs to the courtyard and leaps on the Sheriff's horse, which is held by a stunned groom. He rides through the busy marketplace. A crossbowman tracks him. A sure shot. Marian spots the danger. She fakes being tripped and stumbles into the bowman. His bolt flies harmlessly into the air. MARIAN (innocently) Please excuse my clumsiness. Robin charges for the city gate. As he passes, he kicks the guard who hasseled him into the wall. 
EXT. WOODSMEN'S CAMP - DAY Men gather around as Robin dismounts, admiring the horse. 
ROBIN A personal loan from the Sheriff. ASLAN (furious) You should not have left without me, Englishman. ROBIN How so? You have not raised a finger to protect me. ASLAN Before I had a choice. ROBIN It was my choice to do this alone. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: ASLAN A foolish risk. If you had been killed, I would be cursed for eternity for failing to fulfil my pledge. ROBIN Aslan, if I didn't know better, I would swear you were worried about me. 
EXT. NOTTINGHAM CATHEDRAL The Sheriff maniacally spits out orders to Gisborne. 
NOTTINGHAM Starve them out. Slaughter their livestock. I want to see Locksley's own people fighting each other to bring him to us. GISBORNE I swear he will not live to see the next full moon. 
EXT. HAMLET - DAY A SQUEALING HOG is loaded onto a wagon. SOLDIERS round up the livestock. An old FARMER protests. FARMER Go' bless ya, sir. Leave us the sow. She's with young 'uns. The next litter'll feed us through the winter. SOLDIER You've heard of Robin Hood? FARMER Yes, sir. The Soldier brutally kicks the old man to the ground. SOLDIER Then pray he is brought to us before winter. 
EXT. WOODSMEN'S CAMP - DAY A trail of refugees. Women and children carry their belongings into camp. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Wulf runs to greet his mother and siblings.    A contingent of woodsmen confronts Robin. WILL SCARLET You brought this misery on us, Locksley. We can barely feed ourselves. LITTLE JOHN Sheriff hasn't left us a bloody pot to piss in. ROBIN Then we shall take from him and his rich friends. 
The runners dive into the trees, as other men haul on ropes, raising a giant screen in the soldiers' path. The horses swerve, on the edge of a twenty-foot drop to the river gorge. Momentum  carries many of them over the cliff. BACK ON ROADWAY Robin and Aslan swing down from the trees onto the tax wagon. Kick down the two drivers and take the reins, steering the wagon off the road. The archers inside are unable to fire at them. Little John leaps onto the beer cart, sending the Friar hurtling back among the barrels. The Friar slams his head and drops unconscious. John whips the horse, driving the cart after Robin. Another camouflage screen is lifted into place, covering their route. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Gisborne races back to the road... the wagons are gone. He rides frantically back and forth. Searching and cursing. EXT. FOREST CLEARING - DAY Robin climbs onto the tax wagon's roof.     Angry shouts from inside. ROBIN Surrender your weapons. I give you my word you shall go free. In answer, a swordblade jabs up through the roof, near his feet. 
ROBIN Ah, I feared as much. He signals to Aslan, who steers the tax wagon into the river. Water floods in through the slits. Inside, panic. Drowning rats. The bowmen scramble out. What they see stops them dead. Both banks are men in green, longbows aimed directly at them. CUT TO: COUNTRYSIDE Sparks. An axe pounds into the lock of a strongbox. The lock snaps. Little John pries open the lid. Reacts in astonishment. The trunk is filled to the brim with glittering gold coins. The woodsmen press around. Cheers of celebration. 
LITTLE JOHN (awestruck) I'll be buggered. ROBIN This treasure had a purpose.     We must find out what. He turns at the sound of a brawl from the Friar's cart. The Friar is at the bottom of a struggling heap of bodies. ROBIN Get off him.   He's a man of the cloth. Robin drags the men off. The Friar clambers to his feet. Around him are strewn battered and winded woodsmen. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: FRIAR The Lord's blessing on you, kind sir. These sinners were attempting to steal these libations destined for the monks of St. Catherine's. He indicates his cargo of barrels. ROBIN It appears to me, Reverend Friar, that many of the libations have found their way into your own esteemed person. Ignoring him, the Friar mounts the cart. 
FRIAR A thousand pardons, sir, but duty beckons. I must hasten on. ROBIN (grabbing the bridle) A moment, my reverend friend. You travel with poor company when you travel with Nottingham's soldiers. BULL Aye, tax him. This sparks a chorus of comments. ROBIN My men are thirsty and have much to celebrate. FRIAR Lord bless me, sir, are these your men? I had mistook them for common thieves. Kindly step aside. ROBIN Surely the Lord has the charity to spare a few barrels to good Christian men. The Friar relents, loosening his grip on the reins. FRIAR Well, sir, if you wish them to share in the good Lord's brew... Casually reaching under the seat, he pulls out a club. Smites Robin with it. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: FRIAR ... you must best me for it. Robin staggers. The Friar whips up the horse. Dazed, Robin grabs for the fat man's leg. Gets a holy sandal full in the face. FRIAR Giddyup, nag! The Friar's horse, as obese as his driver, slowly raises his head from the grass and ambles forward. Robin runs after them and dives at the Friar, toppling him from the cart. 
ROBIN You leave when I say. Scrambling to his feet, the Friar glances skyward. FRIAR Protect me, Lord. He sweeps his foot, knocking Robin's legs out from under him. Hurls his full body weight on top of him. Whooomf! FRIAR Yield! He bounces on Robin's stomach. Robin can barely breathe. The woodsmen are enjoying the spectacle. FRIAR Confess that Friar Tuck is a better, holier, and braver man than thou art, knave. 
ROBIN Never!   Whoomf! FRIAR Yield, I say!    Yield to Friar Tuck. Desperate, Robin bites the Friar's leg. Tuck howls. Robin extricates himself, grabs for a weapon. Smashes the Friar's head with his drinking jug. ROBIN Yield yourself! He dives onto the Friar and hammers his head into the ground. (CONTINUED) 
EXT. WOODSMEN'S CAMP - DAY An informal council of war.   Robin uses a stick in the dirt. 
ROBIN We have to be ready to move camp at any time. The only way we can be attacked is from the Nottingham Road. We hide lookouts in the trees, here and here. If they see soldiers, they shoot warning arrows. Whistles by day, fire by night. Wulf runs up to Little John in panic. WULF Father!   Come quick.   Mother's dying. 
INT. WOODSMEN'S HUT - DAY Fanny Little writhes in agony.    John rushes in.   Tuck looks up from Fanny's side. FRIAR The child comes early. Fanny screams.   John kneels beside her, taking her head. LITTLE JOHN Hush, m'lass.    Ya'll be fine. FANNY 'S not like t'others, John.    Oh God, it pains me so. 
LITTLE JOHN (angrily, to Tuck) Ya're sittin' thar like a fat sow. Help her, man, help her! FRIAR I am doing all I can. Aslan appears in the doorway, with Robin. Whips back the blanket. Fanny's chest is covered with black squirming creatures. ASLAN By Allah, leeches! He starts to pull the parasites off.    Tuck jumps at him. FRIAR Get away from her! Aslan pushes him away, continuing his work. 
ASLAN Blood is like air. If she loses blood, she and the child will die. John is paralyzed with confusion.    Tuck appeals to Robin. FRIAR He lies. He is the devil's seed, sent to lead us astray. ASLAN Fool, both the Bible and the Koran instruct us to preserve life. Tuck raises an arm to strike Aslan. Robin blocks the blow. Aslan gently touches the mother's stomach. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: ASLAN (soothing) Your baby has not turned. It cannot be born without help. FRIAR What do you know, you damned savage? ASLAN (to John) If you will allow me, I can help her. It will not be without danger. 
FRIAR Do not listen to him!   He will kill her. ASLAN If you do not listen to me, she will certainly die. And the child, too. Fanny cries out.   John looks to Robin, pleading for advice. ROBIN The good Friar has done all he can. I suggest you let the Arab try. (as John is undecided) If I am wrong, and they die, then you may take my life. 
John's eyes meet his wife's.   She nods. LITTLE JOHN So be it. FRIAR Then it will be on your head. I have warned you. He storms out.   All business, Aslan speaks to Wulf. ASLAN Bring me a needle, thread, water, a skinning knife, and burning ashes. Wulf runs to obey. John looks horrified. Robin eases him outside, then returns to Aslan's side. They whisper. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: ROBIN What are you going to do? ASLAN The child must be taken out by the knife. ROBIN The knife? ASLAN I have seen it many times with horses. ROBIN Horses? By the Lord, what are her chances? ASLAN After wasting so much blood... not good. ROBIN Now you tell me! Wulf runs back in.     Aslan holds up a piece of wood. ASLAN (to Fanny) Are you ready?... Bite down on this... Robin, hold her steady. He lifts the red-hot knife from the ashes. 
MARIAN Who is there?     Duncan! 
INT. DUBOIS MANSION - KITCHEN - NIGHT Marian enters stealthily. A candle in one hand, a drawn dagger in the other. Something leaps at her!... A cat, looking for scraps on the kitchen table. She shoos him down. MARIAN Off, Nicodemus. Go find mice. She sighs with relief... is grabbed from behind.   A masked SOLDIER. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: SOLDIER We meet again. He reveals a large scar on his wrist -- removes his mask -- the man who attacked her earlier. He prods her with his sword. SOLDIER Drop your blade. MARIAN You are still overmatched, soldier. She drops the sword. He hurls her against the table. Lays his blade against her chest. 
SOLDIER You owe me favors, wench. Bare your breasts... or I will do it for you. Resignedly, she raises a hand to loosen the string on her dress. With the other hand she reaches behind her, grabs a pepper bowl. Flips the contents into his face. Screaming, he grabs his  face. She reaches for her dagger. He slashes with   his sword. She backs to the fireplace, grabs a spit  of roasted chickens... drives the point clean through  his chest. He stares in shock at his own blood pouring from the cooked fowls pinned to his breast... FOOTSTEPS... masked soldiers converge from both sides of the house, dragging the servants. Duncan  is shoved through the door. DUNCAN I am sorry, my lady.    There were too many. She stares at the invaders with studied calm. MARIAN Is there something you need, gentlemen? I remember no masked ball on my calendar. CUT TO: 
AERIAL SHOT FLYING LOW OVER treetops, OVER an expanse of green, intersected by brown roads and tracks. We are LOOKING AT a detailed scale model of Sherwood Forest in... 
INT. CASTLE CHAMBER - NIGHT The Sheriff and SIX BARONS are gathered around the model. These are the men who revealed their faces to Lord Locksley in the Druid ceremony. Nottingham toys with a white rat on his arm. REDHEAD BARON Forget about Locksley. He is no threat. NOTTINGHAM How can we control all England if we cannot control our own county? The people are turning him into a hero. 
GREYBEARD BARON It is impossible to attack him in the forest. We have tried everything. He is cunning. NOTTINGHAM Then we   will be more cunning. I must be   rid of him. We may not be able   to intercept his next warning   to the King. Sounds of COMMOTION outside. The door swings open. Framed in the doorway is a colossus in black armor. His helmet is the head of a dragon. He slowly raises the visor. Deep tribal scars on his cheeks. Implacable ferocity in his eyes. CELTIC CHIEFTAIN I want the heads of the men who stole my gold. 
NOTTINGHAM Welcome, sir. We were discussing how to rid ourselves of those very men. The outlaws who band with Robin Hood. REDHEAD BARON My Lord Nottingham, I must protest. It is a mistake to ally ourselves with foreigners. GREYBEARD BARON What can these Celts do that we cannot? (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: The Chieftain strides across to the fire. Grabs a burning log. The Baron backs away in fear. The log spits sparks as the Chieftain raises it above his head... and drives it into his own palm. He stares unblinking at the Baron, holding the log to his hand for a full three seconds. An awed silence. Nottingham grins, delighted with the demonstration. He deposits his white rat onto the model. NOTTINGHAM This rat Hood has hidden out in the forest.  He resists all our assaults with traps and devices, while he robs us blind. We must bring him out and destroy him. The rat has scurried into the shelter of the model trees. The Chieftain watches impassively, then calmly touches the log to the model. The trees ignite... the RAT SQUEALS in terror and runs. The Chieftain cuts off its escape, setting fire to more trees... again... and again. The Sheriff watches the flames, fascinated. DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. SHERWOOD FOREST - DAY The Sheriff's men stomp through the burning forest. From the other side of the flaming trees, Little John's men pick off shots with their longbows. They retreat, turn and fire again. They back into a clearing... The Celtic mercenaries charge at them across the open ground. The woodsmen drop their bows. Hand-to-hand combat. Woodsmen are being decimated. 
Little John storms and shouts, cutting down the enemy, inspiring his men. The Scotsmen are awed by this giant. Tuck is confronted by a wild-eyed Celt. FRIAR Surely you would not harm a man of the cloth? The man swings, Tuck sidesteps. FRIAR You would?   Then to hellfire with you. He pummels the man to the ground with his staff. The woodsmen are broken into two groups. One group, including Will, is surrounded and surrenders. The others fight on. 
Bleeding from several wounds, Little John is surrounded by four Celts. He spins, challenging them, spitting out expletives. Defiant to the last... suddenly his attackers are hurled aside. Robin rides right through them, slashing with his sword. LITTLE JOHN 'Bout bleedin' time, mush. Tuck is driven to the ground... his assailant is deliver- ing the lethal blow, when Aslan cuts him down. Tuck glances heavenwards. FRIAR Thank you, Lord. (an afterthought) And thank you, Allah. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Aslan is a   wild man. Steering his horse with just legs and knees,   he strikes out with both swords to left and right. The    momentum is turning. Wulf appears at the edge of the   clearing. Starts picking off stragglers. His father   spots him. LITTLE JOHN Git the bleedin' 'ell outa there, ya li'l bugger. Distracted, he doesn't see a Celt swing at his back... but Wulf's arrow pierces the man's adam's apple. He freezes in mid-air, before toppling at John's feet. When John turns back, Wulf is being dragged away by three of the Sherrif's men. He attempts to pursue, but is intercepted by two more Celts... and struck down. Aslan charges between the two Celts. Slashes down with both swords. Both men topple to the ground simultaneously. Suddenly all is quiet.    The smoking clearing is a mass of fallen bodies. Only    four men seem to be alive. Robin, Aslan, Tuck, who   is slouched against a tree gasping for breath, and   Hal, who kneels clutching his wounded shoulder. Robin dismounts and runs to Little John. Overwhelmed and exhausted, he slumps over the giant's unmoving form. LITTLE JOHN Don't 'ee start bleedin' blubberin', or ya'll make me bloody vomit. 
Robin manages a relieved smile. Aslan strides over. All around them lie slain Celts and woodsmen. ASLAN It was a fiendish mind that planned this campaign. 
EXT. SHERWOOD FOREST - DUSK A shovel breaks dirt. Beyond exhaustion, Robin digs a grave. The clearing is transformed into a cemetery. Tuck blesses the bodies of Bull and Sarah. Aslan drags a Celt's corpse into a grave. Throws the man's armor and weapons into a growing pile. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: ROBIN You were an honor to your countrymen today, Aslan. You fought better than twenty English knights. ASLAN This war is the God of Abraham against the forces of evil. ROBIN Well, the war is over. He stares across the desolate clearing. 
ROBIN There is too much blood on my hands. 
INT. CASTLE DUNGEONS - NIGHT A heavy key turns in a lock. Bolts drawn back. Fol- lowed by guards, Nottingham enters the torture chamber where the captured woodsmen are chained, among them Wulf and Will Scarlet. Putrid ankle-deep water on the floor, walls encrusted with dried blood and grime. Nottingham walks up to the FIRST MAN. Wry smile. NOTTINGHAM (wry smile) Would you prefer pain or death? FIRST WOODSMAN Death. 
Next, Robin's father.   He stares accusingly right AT us. LOCKSLEY Why have you betrayed me?   Why? Before he pulls the rope, the executioner peels back his hood... It is Robin. Gloating, he hauls on the rope. His laughter blends with that of Mortianna in a hideous cacophony. DISSOLVE TO: 
ROBIN'S FACE DISTORTED in water. The LAUGHTER BECOMES the sound of a RUNNING RIVER. Robin is washing, trying to drive away the horror. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: The first streaks of light fight their way through a thick, morning mist. Out of the mist steps a figure, at first indecipherable. Aware of his presence, Robin looks up. ROBIN Will!    I thought you were taken. WILL SCARLET I was. ROBIN How did you escape? WILL SCARLET I promised to kill you. ROBIN And will you? Before Will can answer, Little John runs up.     Grabs Will's throat. LITTLE JOHN I'll wring yer scrawny neck, Will Scarlet. I'd be doin' yer a bloody favor an' all. Quickly, others arrive. Aslan, Tuck, Hal, Fanny, with kids clinging to her skirts. FANNY Afore ya kill 'im, John, ask 'im if Wulf be still alive. Will is choking, unable to speak. John loosens his hold just enough for Will to splutter out... WILL SCARLET Y... e... LITTLE JOHN Git us a rope, Hal, and we'll put the bleedin' weasel outa 'is misery. ROBIN John, wait.    Let us hear what he has to say. LITTLE JOHN No bugger 'scapes the Sheriff, 'nless 'e's linin' 'is bloomin' pockets. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: ROBIN A traitor sneaks in and out under cover of darkness. Will walked in and announced himself. LITTLE JOHN (dismissive) Aye.    'E always did 'ave balls o' brass. HAL Let's sss... string 'im up. ROBIN Let him speak. 
John reluctantly moves his hold from Will's neck to his shoulders. LITTLE JOHN Search 'im, Hal. 'E'll 'ave a bloody blade on 'im somewheres. Will eyes the accusing faces. Hal searches, lifts Will's shirt. His whole skin is lacerated with deep gashes and fresh burns. LITTLE JOHN Bugger me. He steps back.    Ready to listen. WILL SCARLET I bring a message from Nottingham. Our men are to be hung in the square on Saturday. At high noon. 
FANNY What about my boy? WILL SCARLET The boy, too.    Ten men in all. Fanny drops her head on John's shoulder. WILL SCARLET Their   deaths are a warning. Anyone   who associates with the outlaw   Hood is to suffer the same fate.    Man, woman, or child. Even anyone   who so much as utters his name. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: FRIAR Robin Hood! Robin Hood! Robin Hood! (chuckles) May as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb. WILL SCARLET The hangings are to be part of the celebration for the Sheriff's marriage. LITTLE JOHN Marriage, eh? What lucky wench gits to play with the Sheriff's codpiece? Will turns his gaze directly on Robin. WILL SCARLET Lady Marian. FRIAR He takes a bride of royal blood? LITTLE JOHN Aye, and then with King Richard gone, he takes the bloody throne. Everyone reacts with shock.     Only Robin appears unsur- prised. ROBIN You were to use this news to get close to me, and then kill me? Right, Will? 
WILL SCARLET (sly grin) Not straightway, of course. ROBIN What is your intention, Will? WILL SCARLET That depends on you, Locksley. ROBIN How so? WILL SCARLET I've never trusted you, that's no secret. What I wanna know is, are you gonna finish what you started? (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Robin is on the spot.    All eyes on him.   Will presses his point. WILL SCARLET Will ya stay and keep us fightin' till every man jack of us is dead? Or will you run like the spoiled little rich boy I always took you for? ROBIN You present quite a choice.    What would you have me do, Will? WILL SCARLET If you run, I will kill you. ROBIN And if I stay, will you all stay with me? Robin checks the other faces. ASLAN To the end, friend. FRIAR If my heathen brother stays, I stay. HAL Mmmm... meee... tttt... He can't get it out.    Little John covers Hal's mouth. LITTLE JOHN 'E's in. We're all bloody in. Daft buggers. ROBIN There's your answer, Will.    We finish it. 
INT. NOTTINGHAM CASTLE - CORRIDOR - DAY Boots clack confidently down a stone corridor. The Sheriff decked in wedding finery. He enters... 
INT. CASTLE CHAMBER - DAY 
... Mortianna's apothecary. Dark, smoke-filled. Foul things in jars. Animals in cages, waiting to meet unspeakable ends. Marian is strapped in a chair, flanked by two armed guards. NOTTINGHAM How is my bride? Marian smiles as he leans toward her... and spits in his face. NOTTINGHAM Ah... You are overwhelmed with happiness. He slowly wipes off the spittle... and slaps her hard. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: MARIAN (calm, uncowed) I will never marry you. Mortianna emerges from a dark corner, bearing the goblet she used at the Druid ceremony. MORTIANNA Hold her! Marian struggles against her bonds. MARIAN Get away from me, you disgusting hag. I will not... augh! 
The guards viciously restrain her, forcing her mouth open. Mortianna pours the blood-red liquid down her throat. Marian fights, gagging and choking... until the drug takes its effect. She slumps forward. Nottingham watches with amusement. NOTTINGHAM (to Mortianna) When we are married, thirty of the northern barons will pledge me their support as king. As you predicted. Mortianna squats on the floor besides a platter of blood. Clasps the dice-like runes. NOTTINGHAM What do you see in the portents? Mortianna rocks on her heels, clutching her taloned hands to her sides. She chants, fingering the bloody stones. MORTIANNA The union. The blood of the lion and the house of Nottingham. New faith. New power. New souls. She stares at Nottingham, her red eyes demented. MORTIANNA If there is no union, there will be darkness, despair, death. Ours! NOTTINGHAM Di not give me riddles, woman. We are to be married within hours. How can we be in danger? (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: MORTIANNA The blood does not lie. NOTTINGHAM (shouting) Tell me how it will result. MORTIANNA I have told you what I know. NOTTINGHAM Confound you, crone. Without my protection, the people would hunt you down, rip out your black heart and burn it. 
Mortianna runs at him.   Points her bony finger at his heart. MORTIANNA Without me, you are nothing. You are straw, a fleabite, a speck. (as Nottingham laughs) Laugh, fool. I birthed you from this body. I stole a babe in this very castle, and killed it so that you might rise in its place. You are my son. (Nottingham is too shocked to react) Together we are strong. Now is not the time to doubt. Now is the time to believe, to be bold. The bold will prevail. 
EXT. CITY GATE - DAY Masses stream in. They give wide berth to a Celtic war- rior in a boar's head helmet. Soldiers prod and harness the passing peasants. Tuck drives a cartload of barrels. A GUARD stops him. GUARD What you got there, Father? FRIAR The Lord's finest brew for the good Nottingham's fighting men. It has a mighty kick. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: GUARD (smiling) I'll warrant. Pass. 
CONTINUED: NOTTINGHAM Break one open! FRIAR (nervous) Why waste fine vintage, my lord? A cask is shattered... wine torrents out. WILL SCARLET Try another. There are many barrels, only a few outlaws. A drum roll. The Sheriff's attention turns to the scaffold, where the first victim is escorted up the steps -- Wulf. Tense, Tuck pulls a tinder box from his robes, strikes a flame. 
EXT. CITY PARAPET - DAY John strains, heaving his giant frame up the rope. He nears the top, just as a SENTRY approaches. Fanny blocks the man's view. SENTRY What is your business, woman? FANNY Ain't doin' no 'arm, m'dear. Likes a good 'angin', I do. Luvly view up 'ere, ain't it? She gestures below. The Sentry looks, then turns back to her... notices the rope. With all her might, Fanny rams his head into the stone battlement. Twice. Three times. He slumps unconscious. 
EXT. CITY SQUARE - DAY Wulf crosses himself as the executioner steers him to the noose. A hush falls... except for a rotund old woman who is barging to the front. And a WOUNDED SOLDIER, his head bandaged, who eases her path, striking out with his tree- branch crutch. WOUNDED SOLDIER Give room for a fightin' man and his ma. Step aside, or I'll make ya. I wanna see the bastards walk on air. 
EXT. CITY PARAPET - DAY John struggles over the battlement.   Collapses. FANNY 'Bout time, ya gurt lug. She wrenches the longbow from his back, fumbles for an arrow. FANNY We be too late. 
EXT. CITY SQUARE - DAY The scaffold is impregnable. Celts and their Chieftain guard the platform itself. The Sherriff's men surround the base. The executioner encircles Wulf's neck with the noose. SPARKS! Tuck ignites a fuse-cord leading to one of the barrels. A hand tightens the noose... Another grasps an arrow. The executioner's eyes glint through the slits. Nottingham intently watches Wulf. The Chieftain stands, impassive. Fingers close on a bowstring... the fuse-cord burns. Wulf steps to the trap, ready to plunge.   His eyes close. An arrow flies... slices through the executioner's eye slit. The executioner falls. Little John celebrates... but the Chieftain leaps forward... releases the trap. Wulf's body plunges.   The rope snaps tight. Little John yells.   Fanny screams. A figure leaps onto the platform... the wounded soldier throws aside his crutch... Robin! Wulf dangles, strangling.   His hands wrench at the choking cord. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: The burning fuse-cord reaches the barrel. Tuck hurls the smoking barrel thundering towards the Sheriff... Spotting it, Nottingham urges his horse over his own men in his effort to escape. The Chieftain smites at Robin... his blow is blocked... by the Celt with the boar's head. KAABOOM! The GUNPOWDER in the barrel EXPLODES. Spewing smoke and wood. SCREAMS of panic. Soldiers fly. Mass confusion. Amidst the smoke... Robin's sword slashes through Wulf's rope. He hauls him onto the platform. 
Another figure on the platform... the old woman. Slashes the ropes of the other prisoners. Whips off her wig... It's Hal. He passes out weapons from a bundle under his arm. HAL Here... By God... Let's fight 'em! WOODSMAN Hal! What happened to your stutter? HAL It's gg... ggg... g..oh crap! A guard attacks, Hal fells him. HAL Take that, ya mug. No stutter this time!    The woodsmen join battle with the guards. The Chieftain cudgels his Celt attacker across the head. The boar's head helmet tumbles... revealing Aslan. CHIEFTAIN Impostor!   You dishonor the clan. Aslan retreats, fending off the Chieftain's shattering blows. 
FROM PARAPET John and Fanny peer down as the smoke clears. They watch Wulf struggle to his feet. A Celt sneaks up behind him. LITTLE JOHN Fight fair... (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: He aims.   Grits his teeth... picks off the Celt with a shaft. LITTLE JOHN ...Or don't fight at all. 
INT. CASTLE CHAMBER - DAY Surrounded by flickering candles, Marian sits before a mirror. In a white wedding gown. Her eyes faraway, lifeless, in deep trance. Mortianna sensuously combs the bride's hair with her taloned fingers. The Sheriff's face appears in the reflection. NOTTINGHAM Come!   It is time for the union. The guards roughly haul Marian to her feet.    She is oblivious. 
INT. CASTLE CHAPEL - DAY Once, Christian, now blasphemously transformed   to the practice of black magic. The crucifix on the    altar is upside down. Marian stands before it, between    the Sheriff and Mortianna. The Bishop is dragged    in. Frightened. The BATTLE SOUNDS ECHO. BISHOP They are rebelling. We must escape. NOTTINGHAM Marry us. When I am declared king, that rabble will not dare go against us. BISHOP Is is madness to delay. Mortianna screams and slashes her talons across the Bishop's outstretched hands. Blood flows. MORTIANNA Face them, or face me. 
EXT. CASTLE GATE - DAY Robin leaps onto Tuck's cart. ROBIN Light all the barrels, Tuck. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Robin snaps the reins, steering the rumbling cart across the yard. Bouncing in the back, Tuck lights barrels. FUSES smoke and CRACKLE. ROBIN Jump! Tuck jumps. Robin steers the wagon at the gate. At the last second, he slashes the reins and leaps onto the horse's back... The BARRELS EXPLODE! The portcullis is blown to kingdom come. Out of the smoke, Robin rides the old nag like a charger. Leads his cheering, ragged fighters through the open gate. 
INT. CASTLE KITCHENS - DAY Fanny is chased into the kitchens by a vengeful soldier. He grabs her and pushes her into the open cooking fire. Desperate, she grabs a poker and smashes him over the head. The servants stare in shock... A chef comes at Fanny with a knife. 
EXT. CASTLE FORECOURT - DAY Hal and the others battle against huge odds. More peasants join them, daring to take on the Sheriff's hated men. Aslan's a whirlwind,  striking out in all directions. Each blow for  a cause. ASLAN For Allah!... For Jehovah! For brotherhood!... For justice! 
INT. CASTLE HALLWAYS - DAY A door SLAMS back. Robin bursts through. Alone, against three attackers. He swings a soldier around. Holds him as a shield, using the man's own sword against his companions. In seconds, all three are down and Robin is off and running. Down corridors, searching. Soldiers and armed servants converge to block his way. Robin strikes, vaults, flings statues. Up the stairs... topples a suit of armor down on his pursuers. ROBIN (grabbing a servant) Where is she? Where is Lady Marian? (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: The man refuses to speak. Robin looks up the corridor, sees six men guarding the private chapel's arched door- way. ROBIN Ah!   There is my answer. He hurls the man aside... The armed guards charge him. 
INT. DUNGEONS - DAY Carrying a flaming torch, Tuck runs down the dark passage- ways. Before him, an awesome sight... dozens of pitiful men in cages. Suddenly he is confronted by the jailer. A cruel behemoth of a man, carrying a spiked club. FRIAR (pious) My son, there is a holy war being waged outside. Release all these wretches and God shall surely find you a place in heaven. JAILER I'd rather go to hell! WHAM! Tuck takes the lethal cudgel full in the chest. Flies back. 
CONTINUED: FANNY (CONT'D) Is there one man or woman here who does not hate him? Who has not suffered at his hand? (to the chef) Turn that on the Sheriff and his bullies. A deadly pause. A woman cook dumps the giant wedding cake right over the chef. Suddenly it's havoc. Flying food and cutlery. 
EXT. CITY SQUARE - DAY 
A full-scale riot. The populace has turned. Into the fray comes Fanny Little, leading a rabble of servants and kitchen staff, fighting with pots, pans, brooms, knives, hooks, and bedpans. 
INT. CASTLE - CHAPEL - DAY Nottingham slashes maniacally.   Robin is cornered, weakening. NOTTINGHAM You should have stayed away, Locksley. Fools like you never learn. A blow slices Robin's arm. His sword flies from his grasp. Nottingham gloats. Two of his men scramble back to their feet. Robin is beat... a war cry! Aslan, followed by Tuck. 
ASLAN Ali akbar! FRIAR Amen! MORTIANNA (seeing Aslan) Agh... the painted one! Nottingham glances over... a split-second opportunity!... Robin lashes out. Kicks the Sheriff in the gut, chops down his sword hand. His father's sword clatters to the floor. Whirling swords in each hand, Aslan attacks the other men. Robin pile-drives Nottingham into the wall. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: The Bishop makes his escape.    Tuck blocks his path. FRIAR So! You sold your soul to the devil? BISHOP No, I swear it, in God's name. FRIAR Blasphemer! You accuse innocent men of Druid worship while you practice the black arts yourself. The Bishop surreptitiously draws a dagger from his robes. 
A taloned hand grips a spear... Mortianna creeps up on Aslan. ROBIN (glimpsing her) Watch out! Aslan spins... too late. Screeching, Mortianna drives the spear into Aslan's side. He cries out and slides to the floor. Nottingham uses Robin's distraction to regain his sword. Back on the defensive, Robin tries to evade the blows. Mortianna drags Marian out onto a balcony. Robin cannot pursue. In acute pain, Aslan struggles to his feet. Grasping the spear where it enters his side, he pulls with all his strength. The Bishop, concealed dagger in hand, approaches Tuck. 
BISHOP (innocently) I am sure you would not strike a man of the cloth. FRIAR Think again! Without an eyeblink's pause, Tuck punches the Bishop so hard, he flies back THROUGH a stained-glass WINDOW. 
EXT. CASTLE - BALCONY - DAY Mortianna hauls Marian against the battlements. Peers down at the battle. She spins in shock at Aslan's voice. (CONTINUED)

For revenge, Oscar jerks Snipeshooter out of line and propels him to the rear. OSCAR Inna back, ya ugly little shrimp! Oscar and Morris glare at the crowd, daring anyone to do anything about it. Jack calmly walks Snipe back to his place in line, then faces the Delanceys who try to stare him down. The air is electric. Nearby -- RACETRACK Five to one, I say Cowboy skunks 'em -- who's bettin', who's bettin' -- The Newsies shake their heads.    Nearby the staring contest continues until -- JACK You shouldn't be callin' people ugly little shrimps. Oscar. Unless you're referrin; to the family resemblance in your brother here. The brothers glower, look at each other, then back at Jack, who grins at them. JACK That's right. It's an insult. And so's this -- Jack deftly reaches out both hands and flips the derbys off both their heads. The brothers scramble for them and the chase is on.

It's all Mr. William Randolph Hearst has, too -- see how he covers the strike! The magnifying glass swings to a copy of the New York Journal with a large black headline: "NUDE CORPSE ON RAILS -- NOT CONNECTED TO TROLLEY STRIKE." The CAMERA COMES AROUND to reveal JOSEPH PULITZER, himself, a thundering presence in smoked-glasses and a beard, wielding the magnifying glass like a gavel of judgment. PULITZER Hearst is killing us in the circulation war -- and you give me headlines that would put a whirling dervish to sleep! BUNSEN (nervous editor) We'll get a new headline writer, Mr. Pulitzer. PULITZER Steal Hearst's man -- offer him double what Hearst pays. SEITZ That's how he stole him from us. (sighs) Chief, you spend as much as you make fighting Hearst.

MAYER David?   Time to come in now. Jack looks in at the warm family tableau: the lullaby, Sarah reading to Mayer. David, going in, sees his friend's expression.

JONATHAN Not the customer price -- the price to the distribution apparatus. Exasperated, Pulitzer looks to Seitz for a translation. SEITZ You mean the Newsies...? Charge the Newsies more for their papers? Bad idea, Chief. JONATHAN Very well. My next proposal -- salary cuts, particularly those at the very top -- PULITZER Wait. What  do the Newsies pay now -- fifty cents per hundred papers? If  you raised it to sixty cents -- 
JONATHAN A mere tenth of a cent per paper -- 
PULITZER -- then that, multiplied by forty thousand papers a day, seven days a week -- well, it would pay some of the bills around here.

But as businessmen -- and gentlemen -- we often agree on ways to keep down certain operating costs. If I know Willie Hearst, he's going to wish he thought of this himself.

Jack looks at the huge doors of the World Building, steeling himself. He starts for them, then has a thought -- beckons to Les, who runs to join him, thrilled. JACK Maybe the kid'll soften him up a little. 
Shouting encouragement, the Newsies clear a path as Jack and Les march up to the big doors. Jack pounds on them and there's a hush as everyone waits, watching -- including a handsome, well-dressed man in his thirties, BRYAN DENTON. 
The huge doors swing open like the mouth of a whale and Jack and Les disappear inside. The Newsies cheer. Denton moves next to David.

Jack meets his challenging grin with one of his own. JACK You're movin' up in the world, Spot -- got a ocean view and everything. Spot and Jack exchange "heh-hehs."   David's getting more nervous. 
SPOT So I'm hearin' things from little birdies in Harlem and Queens and all over. They're chirpin' in my ear: 'Jackie-boy's Newsies are playin' like they're goin' on strike -- '

SPOT So they told me. And what did they tell you? David looks nervously at the circling henchmen. DAVID That... they're all waiting to see what Spot Conlon does. That you're the key... (as Spot puffs himself up; David sees an opening) That Spot Conlon is the most respected and... famous... newsie in New York... and probably everywhere else... 
Spot signals the henchmen to stop circling; waits for more, lapping it up.

RACETRACK So where's Spot Conlon? 
Jack looks disgustedly at the activity.

He stands at the window with Seitz. Weasel hovers nearby, awestruck in the presence of Pulitzer. SEITZ I don't think they're just going to go away, Chief. WEASEL Just give me the means, Mr. Pulitzer. I'll take care of them for you. Pulitzer turns his godlike gaze on Weasel, who seems to shrink slightly. Pulitzer studies him a moment. PULITZER (to Seitz) Give him whatever 'means' he requires, I want this nuisance over and done with. 
He looks back down at the square, where Crutchy's crude portrait of him, lying crumpled on the pavement, stares back at him.

David is watching this when someone signals him -- Denton, who points his finger at -- Snyder    edging closer to Jack, checking the time on his pocket    watch. He has something in his  hand -- a tin police    whistle. He puts it to his lips  and is about to blow it    when Denton moves up behind him and -- DENTON Aren't you Warden Snyder? Snyder nearly swallows the whistle -- 
DENTON I'm Denton of The Sun. I've heard about your work with young people. I wonder if you'd agree to an interview? Snyder blinks at him, glances at his watch, then lowers his police whistle, smiling modestly. 
ON STAGE David tries to move to Jack to warn him but Race and the others have formed a chorus line and drag him into it. David shouts over the song -- DAVID Jack -- you've gotta get out of here! Snyder! (as Jack cups his ear) Snyder! 
Jack can't hear over the song but Snyder does -- DENTON (interviewing) Is it Snyder as in 'snide'? Furious, Snyder blows the police whistle for all he's worth. Instantly police burst in from every door -- all converging on Jack. Immediately he leaps off the stage into the arms of several boys below -- then fights his way out the front door --

Denton forces a breezy tone. DENTON Reassigned -- back to my old job as The Sun's ace war correspondent. The owner thinks I should be covering only the 'really important' stories. So wish me luck, boys. At least half what I wish you. (to David) They don't always fire you, David. He moves off; David, stunned, hurries after him. DAVID They bought you off... didn't they? Didn't they! 
DENTON They could've blackballed me from every paper in the country. I'm a newspaperman, I have to have a paper to write for. He looks at David; hurt, betrayed, angry; wishes there was more he could say. He hands him something from his coat. DENTON This is the story I wrote about the rally. I want you to read it at least.

Meanwhile, Jack hits the switch and the PRESS HUMS to life.

ALL SHHHHHHH! (NOTE: During the above, several QUICK CUTS or DISSOLVES should give the impression that they've worked through the night:) A)   Lead type being rapidly hand-set by Denton, helped by David -- a sub-headline forms: "House of Refuge, House of Shame." B)   Papers -- "THE NEWSIE NEWS" -- start rolling off the press as they examine it proudly. 
C)   They fold and bundle the papers, happy but exhausted. D)   Pale pre-dawn light shines through the window framing Les as they pass him bundles of papers and he passes them out the window to --

Jack laughs -- the tension breaks.    Hugs and backslaps as they climb onto the wagon. DAVID The cops are looking for Jack -- we gotta protect him -- KID BLINK Any bull comes after jack, they gotta go through all of us. BOOTS What's with the bundle, Jack -- ya leavin'? JACK Sante Fe bound, Boots -- but not without givin' Pulitzer one last kiss goodbye -- KLOPPMAN Boys -- ! He points frantically at Weasel crossing the square towards them. They duck quickly -- and he weaves past whistling tunelessly, drunk. As Kloppman eases the wagon away, everybody looks back, shouts -- EVERYBODY Hey, Weasel... Good ni-ight! 
He looks around blearily:    must be the d.t.'s. EVERYBODY WE'RE AT THE POINT OF NO RETURN! WE'RE AT THE POINT OF NO RETURN!

185A   HUNDREDS OF COPIES OF THE NEWSIE NEWS (OPTICAL)            185A swirl and cascade, FILLING the SCREEN as we see SUPERIMPOSED a series of living portraits of the working children of the 1890s... young boys in too- large caps and too-small coats, holding lunchpails... holding picks and shovels far too large for them... girls in shapeless dresses sewing, or scrubbing... shining eyes, dirty faces... sad expressions beginning to bloom into hope as they snatch and read the news that the headline proclaims as it whirls TOWARD us ON the SCREEN: HOW WE CAN STOP THIS CITY! 
We see that same headline across -- 
185B   INT. MANSION - BACK OF MAN'S HEAD - MORNING                185B 
as he reads the Newsie News at breakfast attended by a butler (the Rough Rider) in a khaki uniform. He's reading a headline: "HOUSE OF REFUGE, HOUSE OF SHAME" with a subhead beneath it: "SCANDAL HIDDEN FROM TEDDY ON VISIT." We glimpse a famous walrus mustache as the Man slams his fist on the table in anger. A figure steps INTO FRAME across the table: Denton. 
DENTON I thought you'd feel that way, Governor Roosevelt. TEDDY ROOSEVELT (MAN) Dis-graceful, Denty! Those poor boys -- and I did nothing! (pure steel) Until now! 
The Rough Rider snaps out a silk hat and a silverheaded walking stick. Teddy snatches them as if they were armor.

187    EXT. NEWSIE SQUARE - DAY                                   187 Our Newsies look anxiously around the square, empty except for them. They take pains to conceal Jack among them. MUSH So when's the others comin', Cowboy? 
PULITZER You're going to listen to me, boy -- JACK I'd like to, Joe -- (opens a window; crowd noise pours in) -- but I can't hear ya. PULITZER We had a deal -- you broke it. You're going back to jail. JACK Maybe. But you can't put every kid in that square in jail. They ain't goin' away, Joe. PULITZER Neither am I. I can wait them out. It won't be me that's hurt. JACK You sure about that? 
He nods at David who produces a paper, reads: (CONTINUED)

Why? 
JACK It ain't about money, Dave -- if Joe gives in, that would mean nothin's like us got power. He can't let that happen -- no matter what it costs him. Right, Joe? PULITZER I'm about to show you what power really is... He slams the window shut; CROWD NOISE abruptly DROPS -- 
PULITZER I have the police outside waiting to arrest you -- DAVID You lousy double-crossing -- ! PULITZER -- then I'll deal with that rabble in the street. He's crossing to a buzzer on his desk; Jack, thinking fast, snatches up a copy of the Newsies News. 
JACK Ya got me, Joe -- but tell me one thing, willya? How'd ya like our paper -- nice printin', ain't it? Right off the presses of one of New York's greatest newspapers -- 
That stops him.    He looks at Jack, frowning. 
PULITZER All the papers have an agreement... we print nothing about the newsies. Whose press did you use? (as Jack shrugs, smiles) It was Hearst, wasn't it...!

PULITZER I knew it. Whoever helped you print this lying rag is trying to break the strike, get the jump on the rest of us. Well, you're going to expose this backstabber to the other owners -- in exchange, I'll call off the police. 
Jack and David exchange glances, seeing an opening -- JACK Not enough, Joe -- you gotta deal with our demands. Otherwise, our lips are sealed. 
PULITZER (impatiently) All right, all right -- just say the traitor's name. It's Hearst, isn't it? Say it! Say the name of the scoundrel whose press you used so I can make him the disgrace of the newspaper world! Say his name, damn you! 
He thunders over them, eyes blazing in triumph. The boys say nothing, just smile up at him knowingly until at last the horrible truth begins to dawn and -- 
JACK We just wanna say, 'Thanks, Joe.' (as he stares, stunned) And Hearst and them other owners? Maybe they don't have to know. Depends. 
Pulitzer walks with stiff dignity to the window; from below, the FAINT CHANTING floats seems deafening to his ears. 
PULITZER Perhaps we can resolve our... small differences. David digs out their demands and prepares to read.

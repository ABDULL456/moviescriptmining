ANDY Is she responsible for the punch? 
MIKE No. 
ANDY Good. It's terrible. 
BROOKE My cousin will be here tomorrow. 
MIKE Great. 
Sean finds them, and bursts into their group. 
SEAN Michael, Michael, Dad said to find you. 
ANDY Okay, you did that. 
SEAN Come on, Mikey, come on... 
He tugs at Mike's sleeve; Mike allows himself to be dragged off. 
MIKE Okay, okay. Got to go. 
Andy and Brooke are left standing together, Tim moves in. 
TIM (to Brooke) Want to dance? (she shakes her head "no") Okay. Later? 
On her shrug, as she turns to Andy: 
CUT TO: 
INT./EXT. HOLIDOME PATIO/TERRACE - NIGHT 
It's later; night has fallen, the band is playing its version of "When I Fall in Love." Many teen-agers are dancing out on the patio, some adults are dancing inside, the buffet is ravaged, Timmy is watching Brooke, who's dancing with Polo. 
Douglas Fetterman ("Doug") joins him, after asking Marge for a dance and striking out. 
DOUG Get a dance yet? 
TIMMY Nope. 
DOUG Me neither. 
TIMMY Who'd you ask? 
DOUG Tina Wilcox. 
TIMMY You're crazy. She's Ed's girl friend. 
DOUG Doesn't hurt to ask. Sometimes the most beautiful girls are the loneliest. 
TIMMY That's a crock of shit. 
DOUG I know. 
Bob Burnside, a tall pal of Larry Vaughn Jr.'s, turns up by their side. 
BOB Same tired old faces. You see Vaughn? 
DOUG The mayor? 
BOB Larry Vaughn Junior? (Doug shrugs) If you see him, tell him I got a six- pack, a blanket, and the Brebner twins. 
He exits, on the prowl. 
TIMMY No class. 
DOUG None at all. (pause) I wonder what the Brebner twins are doing tomorrow night. 
ANGLE ON BRODY AND ELLEN 
BRODY Can you take a little time out from your busy schedule to dance with the old man? 
ELLEN Why? 
BRODY Because they're playing our song. 
And sure enough, they are -- the band has turned to a Fifties slow-dance standard: "I Wish You Love." Peterson approaches. 
PETERSON May I have this dance? 
BRODY Sorry, I'm all booked up... (taking Ellen) Come, m'dear. 
They slowly fox trot out onto the terrace. Both of them nodding greetings to townspeople and kids -- everyone knows the chief. 
BRODY Remember 1959, the Jersey shore? 
ELLEN And how. I thought you wouldn't respect me. 
BRODY I did, I did. 
The music and the summer moon are working their magic. 
BRODY Listen -- what are you doing later? 
ELLEN Fooling around? 
BRODY Right. 
He dips with her; they look up and notice Sean, sound asleep on a bench. 
ELLEN Let's get the kid home. 
BRODY Home it is. 
He crosses to the sleepy Sean and hoists him with a grunt. 
BRODY (to the kid) You're getting a little big for this. 
Sean murmurs sleepily and hugs his dad. Mike, dancing with Marge, waves good-bye. The Brodys start to leave, passing a bucket with a bottle of champagne still in it. They exchange a look, nod agreement, and Brody boosts the bottle, sneaking it out of the building while Ellen giggles. 
SKIPPER You got a gold-plater drifting in the main channel. Big cruiser. 
HENDRICKS Whereabouts? 
SKIPPER Off the Point. No running lights, just a diver's flag. 
HENDRICKS (aside to Brody) Want me to run out there? 
BRODY On your own time? 
HENDRICKS Happy to do it. 
BRODY Then check it out. I'll be in the office. 
Hendricks nods, and starts the engine importantly. 
HENDRICKS Cast off your bow line. And your stern line. Spring line... 
While Red grumbles, Brody and Sean are walking up to the street. 
Michael and some teen-agers are headed down to the dock. 
ANGLE ON BRODY AND THE KIDS 
It's Mike, Polo, Patrick, Lucy, Brooke, Ed and Tina. 
BRODY Where to? 
MIKE No place special. Just hanging out. 
BRODY Sailing? 
Mike nods. 
BRODY Watch your kid brother, huh? 
He gets into his jeep, leaving Sean with the teen-agers. 
BROOKE Bye, Mr. Brody. 
The others ad lib appropriate greetings/good-byes, as Brody drives off in his jeep. 
EXT. DOCKSIDE - DAY 
The Kids busy themselves with their boats while Sean hovers around Mike, who's not happy at baby-sitting his kid brother. 
POLO Anyone want to sail to the lighthouse? 
PATRICK Machs nix to me. 
LUCY Anyone got a spare mooring line? Mine's shot. 
TINA I've got one... 
SEAN Can I go too? 
MIKE No. 
SEAN Please. 
MIKE I said, 'No.' 
Tina's in her boat, "Tina's Joy," a neat sloop. Mike is going over his "Green Machine," a sleek catamaran. 
BROOKE You're not going out right away, are you? 
MIKE Waiting for Andy. 
BROOKE I want you to meet my cousin. 
MIKE I will, I will. 
SEAN I want to go out with you. You need a crew, don't you? 
Before Sean can protest further, Mike spots his crew: Andy Nicholas, a round-faced, frizzy-haired pal, wearing a bathing suit, and carrying some scuba gear from an early-morning diving class. Marge and Denise, two other divers, are with him, with their gear. They ad-lib "good-byes." 
MIKE I don't need you. Andy's here. 
SEAN You always go with Andy. 
MIKE (to Andy) How was dive class? 
ANDY Same as always -- glub-glub, bubble- bubble, stroke-stroke. There sure is some weird shit on the bottom of the ocean. 
BROOKE Shells and lobsters and stuff? 
ANDY Mostly old garbage. Today we found a '48 Hudson. 
SEAN Do I have to play with the little kids? 
MIKE Yeah. Go on, beat it. 
Sean mopes away while Andy and Mike get their boat ready for sea. 
FOLLOW SEAN OFF THE DOCK 
Up on the street, where a pretty girl with a sexy face and a provocative post-pubescent walk is asking him directions. 
He points down at the dock. The Girl, Jackie Peters, waves at her cousin, Brooke. 
JACKIE Brooke! Hey! 
One of the boats has a portable radio going. It's playing some medium-hot salsa. Jackie does a couple of dance steps on her way down the dock. 
CLOSE ON ANDY AND MIKE 
ANDY Who's that? Quick -- I'm in love. 
MIKE I hope that's the cousin. 
Brody is trying to reason with an indignant fat man. 
INDIGNANT MAN I can't watch the news, I can't watch a ball game, I can't watch movies -- all I hear is that rotten kid with his rotten radio... "Breaker, Breaker..." 
BRODY I'll do what I can, but you're talking about a federal jurisdiction... 
INDIGNANT MAN (leaving in a huff) So call the FBI! 
POLLY Black, two sugars. 
BRODY Thanks. What else is out there? 
POLLY One petty theft, one domestic disturbance, and an exhibitionist. 
BRODY I'll take the exhibitionist, you handle the others. 
WOMAN Chief Brody? I want you to do something about my first husband. 
Brody is caught in the open. 
WHITE-HAIRED MAN Martin, you have got to demand that Grace Kinney keep her shades down. 
2ND MAN What about enforcing the "No Parking" ordinance on Beach Road? 
BRODY In a minute, in a minute -- talk to Mrs. Prendergast, please... 
WOMAN (continuing) Albert keeps coming around when I'm with gentlemen friends and he throws mud on their cars... 
2ND MAN (eager to be heard) Every time there's an out- of-state car in my driveway, I lose another mailbox. Those little iron sailboats cost thirty-two dollars each! 
BRODY (to White Haired Man) Talk to me about Mrs. Kinney. 
WHITE-HAIRED MAN Her bedroom window faces my oldest boy's bedroom, and she's teasing him, dancing around in a towel, or less... 
BRODY Dancing? 
Hendricks has entered, carrying the camera brought up from the bottom by the divers. 
HENDRICKS Chief... 
BRODY Hendricks. I want to go over your reports and your Form 908. 
They go into Brody's inner office; the uproar continues behind the door, but it's calm in here. 
HENDRICKS I never heard of a 908. 
BRODY I just made it up. It means, "Get me out of there." (notices the camera) What the hell's that? 
HENDRICKS Diver's camera. Tom Andrews brought it up from under that abandoned cruiser. 
BRODY Abandoned? It's a little early in the season for that. 
HENDRICKS Rich people. Home port is Newport, Rhode Island. 
BRODY If I had a $100,000 boat, I sure as hell wouldn't leave it anchored alone in the channel. 
HENDRICKS If you had a $100,000 boat there'd be an investigation. 
Hendricks puts the camera in an informal "Lost & Found" box sitting in the office. Brody makes the mistake of opening the door, revealing the White-Haired Man. 
WHITE-HAIRED MAN Grace Kinney is driving my boy to distraction. 
BRODY Hendricks, get a description of that dance. 
LARGE MAN (to Brody) Chief Brody? I want to talk to you about my daughter... she's 15, but mature for her age... 
WOMAN Chief, I've been telling Mrs. Prendergast that it's no good just talking about Albert, she's got to do something... 
2ND MAN Look -- the township is responsible for protecting life and property, and my property is unprotected... 
As Brody turns to deal with the mess, we: 
CUT TO: 
UNDERWATER 
Looking up at the surface, where a hull floats in silhouette against the daylight. There's a commotion, and a water ski drops into view. Then another one. Pale legs churn the water. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. OCEAN - DAY 
Off Amity Beach, a bilious green lap-straked boat is bobbing in the water, the engine idling. Two girls are fooling around; the one in the water is Terry, the one driving the boat is Diane. 
TERRY Did you ever see a dolphin? 
DIANE Sure. They like to play. We may see some today. 
TERRY Great! 
She fumbles with her skis. 
TERRY Whoops, almost lost one. Can't play with the dolphins without skis... 
DIANE Ready? 
TERRY Hang on, hang on... Okay, go. 
Diane goes to the controls, and puts the engine into gear, starting forward. Terry waves "okay," Diane opens up the throttle, the boat surges forward, pulling Terry upright. 
A wake boils out from under her skis. 
ANGLE ON THE BEACH 
Ed and Tina are camped on a blanket, necking in the shelter of the dunes. There's a portable radio, a cooler with some beer, and some sandwiches -- a perfect afternoon alone. Above the dune, behind them lies the ocean, where the girls' ski boat can be seen, raising a big wake. Tina disengages, and sits up, brushing sand out of her hair. 
TINA Take a break for a minute, okay? 
ED Huh? 
Mrs. Witherspoon looks up, startled by the sudden tragedy. 
She gets up to go to the phone, indoors, and we: 
CUT TO: 
EXT. OCEAN - DAY - AMITY POLICE BOAT 
The launch is anchored at the site of the explosion, offshore. 
Red is fishing up bits of flotsam with a boathook. Hendricks is on the radio, talking to the shore. 
HENDRICKS I can't find anyone out here. They must've gone to the bottom, or drifted with the current. 
BRODY ON SHORE 
He's on the porch of tile Witherspoon house, using his portable walkie-talkie. Mrs. Witherspoon is waiting in the b.g. 
Nearby, we can see a sign: "BURIED CABLE: Call New England Light and Power Before Digging." The cable itself surfaces in a chain-link fenced enclosure, and climbs a power pole for distribution to the island. Ed and Tina are also there, having given statements. 
BRODY There should be bodies. Witnesses say two people; one in the boat, one skiing. 
HENDRICKS (O.S.) (filtered) I told you -- nothing here. 
BRODY Try dragging. 
HENDRICKS (O.S.) For how long? Current's moving everything around, and it's getting dark. 
BRODY Stay on it. I don't care how long it takes. 
HENDRICKS (O.S.) 
Brody turns to Ed and Tina, and takes out his notebook. 
TINA We heard this noise, like a 'boomp' out there, and when we looked, there was just this cloud of smoke. 
GRACE That was the explosion. One minute they were having a wonderful time, the next, bang! 
BRODY 
GRACE I don't know what could've done that. 
Brody stares out at the quiet sea -- what's lurking under that calm surface? 
TINA Can we go now? 
Brody's still looking past them, towards the ocean. 
TINA Chief Brody -- can we go? Please? 
BRODY Oh, yeah. Sure. 
As he gazes at the ocean, we hear the sound of a distant siren, and 
CUT TO: 
EXT. AMITY - DAY 
An ambulance, siren wailing and red light flashing, drives on its melancholy way through the picturesque town. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
ABROAD THE POLICE BOAT - NIGHT 
Hendricks has the winch in operation, the cable in his hand, with big grappling hooks attached. The boat is lit by its powerful worklights. Hendricks heaves them out, watches as the current takes them, then puts the winch in gear, hauling back. 
RED How much longer? 
HENDRICKS Until we find something. 
RED I don't care about the overtime, I'm hungry. And cold. And most of all, bored. 
INSERT - THE WINCH CABLE 
It goes taut with a sudden strain. 
ANGLE ON HENDRICKS 
He sees it, too. 
HENDRICKS I think we got something. 
Red moves to the winch, watching warily as it slows to a near stall with the weight. 
RED About damn time. 
HENDRICKS What the hell is it? 
There's a strain on the cable -- it's pulling the stern of the boat down as it struggles with the weight. 
HENDRICKS Here it comes... 
ANGLE ON THE WATER 
lit by the harsh worklights on the deck of the launch. The cable from the winch is taut, pulling something up from the black depths. What? The coupling appears, then the hook, and an oily cable. 
RED Oh shit. Drop it. 
HENDRICKS What is it? 
RED Power line. 
HENDRICKS Oh, great. 
He hits the release on the winch, and the cable whines as it spins out and settles back on the bottom. Red jiggles the line, trying to free it up. 
RED It comes here from Cable Junction. 
HENDRICKS Untangle it and let's go -- We don't need a blackout on the island. 
ELKINS Not necessarily. These wounds could've been inflicted 30 miles out to sea, or more. None of them are immediately fatal. Currents could've carried the body 10 miles further. 
HENDRICKS (chiming in) We got a helluva tide this month. 
BRODY Could you just keep that crowd back, please? 
MIKE (fidgeting) Pop... 
BRODY You stay right here. You're going in with me. 
ANGLE ON BRODY AND MIKE 
As Elkins examines the whale, calling her observations to Hendricks. 
MIKE We came out in my boat. 
BRODY Andy can sail in it. 
MIKE I got a date! 
BRODY She'll understand. 
MIKE She won't. 
ELKINS Lower jaw displaced and lacerated by predator attempt to seize the tongue. Additional large tissue loss in the dorsal and sub- dorsal areas, as well as the caudal. Oriamal bite radius 37 inches, allowing for salt-water erosion and subsequent small predator and scavenger tissue attacks... 
The Kids have moved a little closer to hear what's going on between father and son. 
BRODY I don't want to discuss it. 
Elkins crosses to Brody. 
ELKINS It's either a Great White, or another killer whale. 
BRODY Can't you tell? 
ELKINS Not when it's like this. This animal has been ashore for 10, 12 hours, and drifting for a day, at least. Every little nibbler in the sea's taken a bite. 
BRODY Look -- can Great White Sharks communicate? Send out signals, or something? You know, take revenge, sense an enemy... 
ELKINS Don't be ridiculous -- Sharks don't take things personally. 
MIKE Dad, please... 
Brody turns on him.  This at least, is something he can do something about. 
BRODY No more sailing. You come back with me, and that's it. 
MIKE Why me? 
BRODY Because I say so. 
ANDY I'll tie up at the town dock, don't worry, man. 
JACKIE See you later, Mikey... 
ED AND TINA Later, bye... (ad lib) 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. AMITY TOWN HALL - DAY 
Vaughn and Brody enter, walking through the spare, empty town meeting hall, towards the conference table. They are alone. 
VAUGHN I'm showing summer rentals. We got a helluva season going. 
BRODY We have got to talk, and we have got to talk alone. 
VAUGHN We're alone. 
BRODY Larry, I don't know how to say this, but I think we got a shark problem. A real one. 
Vaughn stares at him, then unlocks the door to his private office -- "Mayor" -- and leads Brody in. 
INT. VAUGHN'S OFFICE - DAY 
Small, expensively furnished in antiques, with a few symbols of Amity boosterism cluttering one wall: a photo of the beach, featuring a shark tower; an architect's rendering of the new Holiday Inn, some charts and graphs showing upward progress, a few stills of businessmen's luncheons, plaques, awards, etc. 
VAUGHN Are you serious? 
BRODY Of course. Look -- I've got some missing persons, fatalities, evidence of a large predator... 
VAUGHN No one has seen a shark -- no fin, no bites, nothing. Be realistic. 
BRODY I got a feeling. I have to act on it -- you can understand that, can't you? 
VAUGHN Of course I can, but can't it wait? These things cost money, and this town doesn't have much money. 
BRODY We have to do something. 
VAUGHN We have done something -- hell, we damn near went broke putting up a shark watch tower on the beach -- it's the only one in 2000 miles, y'know. 
BRODY I know, I know... 
VAUGHN And I stood by while you told the people from Ramada and Marriott that if they put up a hotel they'd need $800,000 worth of steel net around their beaches! In New England? We all lost on that one. 
BRODY It's still a good idea. 
VAUGHN Martin, when we build up our tax base a little, you can have everything you want; right now, the town's broke. 
BRODY Please, Larry -- there's good reason. Those water skiers... 
VAUGHN (interrupting) A tragedy. But that was a boating accident; no bites, no sharks, nothing but a boating accident. 
BRODY Two of them are still missing! 
VAUGHN There's always deaths in these waters that never turn up. Are they all shark victims? 
BRODY Maybe they are! 
BRODY You got it. 
The Deputy rummages in the locker, happy to be on the trail. 
HENDRICKS I know just where to go. 
BRODY Not the drugstore! 
HENDRICKS Of course not, They're closed. Phil Fogarty's place. He'll do it for me. 
BRODY The drugstore's closed? What the hell time is it? 
HENDRICKS Nine-thirty, ten maybe. 
BRODY Shit -- I'm late for dinner... Close up, okay? 
And he runs for the door, the speed-loaders with the Cyanide bullets safely in his pocket. 
BRODY (at the door) Oh yeah -- I'm expecting a long distance call, very important. Give them my home phone. 
HENDRICKS Right. 
Brody pats his pockets to make sure the speed-loaders are safe inside, then exits. As Hendricks watches him go, 
CUT TO: 
EXT. BRODY HOUSE - NIGHT 
Brody's jeep pulls up, and he gets out, beat. He is slouching towards the door when he hears the phone ring inside. He perks up, and starts to move faster. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BRODY HOUSE - NIGHT 
Ellen is on the phone in the den as Brody enters the house. 
The Kids are on the floor in front of the TV, playing an electronic video game that pings and beeps softly under the following. 
ELLEN (into the phone) Thank you. I'll tell him. 
BRODY For me? 
ELLEN (hanging up) Sort of -- Matthew Hooper is aboard the research vessel Aurora, presently in the Antarctic Ocean, and won't be in radio range until half-past next spring. 
BRODY Damn. 
He starts upstairs, casually concealing the towel-wrapped package of gun and ammunition. 
MIKE Is Hooper coming to dinner? 
BRODY Not till next year. 
He goes upstairs, Ellen waits a few beats, then follows him. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BRODY HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - NIGHT 
Brody comes up the stairs and goes into the bedroom, where he carefully puts the gun in the bed table. Ellen finds him. 
BRODY Oh, hi -- How was dinner? 
ELLEN Oh, perfect -- a 75 per cent family affair. Where were you? 
BRODY (getting up) Santos' place. 
They both know what that means -- the morgue. Brody goes into the bathroom and starts scrubbing his hands compulsively. 
INT. BRODY HOUSE - BATHROOM AND HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Ellen follows Brody, watches as he washes under too-hot water. 
BRODY Oww! 
ELLEN Careful. What's wrong? 
BRODY Nothing. 
ELLEN Nothing, huh? 
BRODY That's what I said. Is there any of that hand cleaner stuff? 
ELLEN Use the little brush there. Why were you at Santos'? 
BRODY Found one of the missing victims from that boat deal. 
ELLEN Oh. Want to talk about it? 
BRODY No. 
ELLEN Terrific. 
Mike comes up the stairs, and is starting into his room when Brody spots him; Sean is just behind him. 
BRODY Michael. 
MIKE Yeah? 
BRODY You want to come here a minute? 
Mike shrugs and crosses to his father; Sean whizzes past on into his room. 
SEAN Hi Dad. 
BRODY Hiya yourself. 
MIKE What is it? 
He expects something: this is a formal audience with the Head of The House. 
BRODY (interrupting) Did you get any pictures? 
PHIL Well, yeah, I did, that's the funny thing. You can't tell much from the negatives, I was going to blow 'em up. Here's a test I did... 
He holds out an 8 x 10 proof, Brody snatches it from him. 
INSERT - PHOTOGRAPH 
Brody stares down at it. Sure enough, the ghostly outlines of the Orca, underwater, a diver on the deck making a gesture at the camera. 
BRODY (O.S.) Oh, Jesus. That boat... 
ANGLE ON BRODY AND PHIL 
PHIL Not bad -- that's a real fast lens, probably 1.4. Look at the diffusion, though... 
BRODY What else you got? 
PHIL Let's see -- you got a minute? 
BRODY Come on, Phil, don't jerk me around. 
PHIL Okay, okay -- stand over there... 
He gestures, Brody steps to one side of a table with some big enamel pans for washing and developing prints. Phil switches to a red light, and takes some printing paper, putting it under the enlarger. 
QUICK CUTS: 
--  Enlarger light going on. 
--  Timer ticking, the hand turning. 
--  Quick negative images: water, boat, diver, hand, boat again, tantalizing fragments of the opening sequence projected on the enlarger's flat base. 
--  Hypo and Developer sloshing in a pan under Phil's hands. 
--  Brody staring down. 
INSERT (PROCESS) 
Quietly gaining contrast in a pan of developer, a print of what at first looks like seaweed, then is unmistakably the grinning jaws of the Great White. 
SUBLIMINAL FLASH CUT - SHARK 
A quick nightmare vision of Brody, alone in a sinking Orca, trapped in a battered cabin interior; a Great White crashes through the glass, its head huge as it lunges. 
INSERT PHOTOGRAPH IN DEVELOPER (PROCESS) 
The close-up detail of this otherwise blurred and unreadable photo is unmistakably a detail from a very close view of the snapping jaws of a Great White; if you hadn't seen it as a memory, it would make no sense at all. For Brody, the meaning is all too clear; for anyone who's never seen the monster face-to-face, it's nothing. 
BRODY (O.S.) (shaken) That one there. That one... 
Phil's hands, holding plastic tongs, gently slosh the print in the bath. The shark's features are indistinguishable from the surrounding detail. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. TOWN HALL - NIGHT 
Brody walks into view, and starts up the steps into the town hall, already lit from within. He's carrying a large envelope. 
INT. TOWN HALL - NIGHT 
The Selectmen (Kaiser, Sansom, Nichols), Len Peterson, and Vaughn are seated informally around the big table. 
PETERSON (looking up) Speak of the devil. 
Brody enters, carrying the envelope with the photo. 
BRODY Thank God you guys were all together. I got something for you. Proof! 
VAUGHN Martin, this is kind of an official meeting 
BRODY Perfect. Look at this --- 
He fumbles with the envelope. 
VAUGHN Chief -- the Board of Selectmen has a question only you can answer. 
BRODY (preoccupied) What? 
PETERSON Is Jeff Hendricks qualified to fill in as an interim Chief of Police in your absence? 
BRODY Temporarily? Uh... sure... The question's out of left field. Why are they asking? 
NICHOLS So Jeff could handle things? He knows the routine, he has the authority? 
BRODY Yeah. Why? 
PETERSON It came up during the meeting. 
BRODY Look -- I just got this from Phil Fogarty. It was in the camera belonging to the missing divers. It proves I was right, all along. 
He throws the picture down in front of them. They bend over to study it, pass it around, look at it. 
KAISER Seaweed? 
NICHOLS It's underwater, isn't it? That's why it's so dark. 
SANSOM I don't know -- what is it? 
BRODY It's a shark! A Great White! Jesus, it's right there! 
He snatches up the photo. 
INSERT PHOTO 
Just as before, an ambiguous pattern of light and dark; not proof of anything without Brody's inner vision. 
VAUGHN (O.S.) It's nothing I can see. 
He tosses the photo sloppily on the desk. 
ELLEN What? 
BRODY What'd I say? 
ELLEN That you were fired. 
BRODY Then that's what I meant. Fired. Canned. Out on my fanny. The Selectmen just made Hendricks the new Chief of Police. Just like that. 
ELLEN Because of today? The beach? 
BRODY (expansively) No sweat. A blessing in disguise. Back to the city, you can go to Bloomingdale's without waiting six hours for the ferryboat... we're surrounded by water here, you realize that? Me, surrounded by water... Ridiculous. 
ELLEN Stop that! We're not going any place. You love it here. Tell me what the hell happened! 
BRODY Showed them the photo, showed them the goddamn Shark, big as life. They didn't see it. Not like me. Not like the poor son-of-a-bitch who snapped this li'l picture... He's out there, somewhere... I shot off my gun, shot off my big mouth, so they fired me... 
ELLEN (studying the photo) Honey, this is nothing... I don't know what it is. What did they... 
BRODY (going on) ...Everybody wants the job. No one wants the authority. Except Hendricks. Fine. He can go out there in that precious boat, and when he looks whitey in his big mouth he can just call me. Call me in New York... tell him to kiss my ass... 
ELLEN (seeing his pain) They have no right to treat you like that. You've given them everything. For four years, you've protected this town, the people on this island... 
BRODY Fired me! (at Ellen) I'm not a hysterical man. I'm responsible. I know what I saw... 
ELLEN I know you did... 
BRODY I try. Goddamnit, I tried... Now, I'm tired... I can't keep fighting it... I'm too tired... I'm... I'm... 
Brody's slipping under; the beers and the day have finally overcome him. He slumps in Ellen's arms. 
ELLEN You're drunk is what you are... 
She eases him onto the couch, tucking a comforter over his inert shape. 
ELLEN Take it easy... Easy... 
ANGLE ON THE STAIRWELL 
Sean comes down the stairs, sleepy, in his pajamas. 
SEAN Is dad home? I heard something... 
He comes into the darkened den. 
ELLEN AND SEAN 
ELLEN Shhhh. Go back upstairs. Daddy's sleeping. 
Sean finds the photo, and stares at it idly. 
SEAN What's this? 
ELLEN Nothing, sweetheart. Seaweed. 
She takes him by his sleepy hand and leads him out of the room, leaving Brody tucked in on the couch, dead to the world. 
CUT TO: 
INT. NEWSSTORE - NIGHT 
This is the Amity teen-ager's hangout -- a newsstand and pinball arcade with a minimal refreshment counter where soft drinks and submarine sandwiches are dispensed. A jukebox is blaring some n.d. rock music. Present are Donnie, Doug, Timmy, Bob, Larry Vaughn Jr., Brooke, Marge, Denise, Jane, Andy, and Mike. The boys are passing around hot-rod van and custom boat magazines; the girls are looking at Silver Screen, Tiger Beat, People, and Time. Andy and Mike are at the counter, splitting a sandwich. 
DOUG (holding a book) That's what I want -- a gaff rig. 
TIMMY Gaff rigged? Why not a staysail schooner? Go anywhere. Look at this -- the Mayan, an Alden schooner. 
BOB Hey, Mike -- I saw your dad over at the town hall. 
MIKE I know. 
DOUG (innocently) Did he really freak out at the beach? 
MIKE I don't know. 
ANDY Hey, it's all bullshit. Anyone want to play pong for money? 
No one does. There's a bustle at the door, and some couples enter from the movies: Patrick and Lucy, Ed and Tina, Polo and Jackie. There are a lot of ad-lib greetings; 
LARRY How was the show? 
ED Yech. 
TINA It was okay. 
PATRICK I'd rather go the lighthouse. 
LUCY Who wouldn't. 
POLO Anyone want to go the lighthouse? 
BROOKE Now? At night? 
POLO Nah. Tomorrow. Early, spend the day. My folks left two cases of beer in the garage. 
PATRICK Is it still there? 
POLO Nope. Got it in my boat. 
LUCY All-right. 
JACKIE Let's go for it. 
There's a general ad-lib agreement to organize a day's sailing picnic. 
TINA Mike, you going? 
MIKE Why shouldn't I? 
BRODY Mike left early. Couldn't wait to make out. Must be a morning man. 
Ellen and Brody sip their coffee quietly for a few moments. 
Mrs. Silvera arrives, carrying groceries. 
MRS. SILVERA Morning. Anything special today? 
ELLEN Sean's not up yet. You know what he likes, just some Fruit Loops and milk. No candy. 
BRODY The sink upstairs is busted. Try some Drano, or a plunger, maybe. Or call your brother, the plumber, what's his name... 
MRS. SILVERA Frankie. He's my cousin. 
BRODY Frankie. Okay. Ask him if he needs an apprentice. 
Brody and Ellen are at the door. 
MRS. SILVERA Have a nice day. 
They leave. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. DOCKSIDE - DAY 
The Kids are into their boats, fitting out for a day of recreational offshore sailing. Mike and Andy are readying his Tornado, while Sean gets in the way. In the b.g., Hendricks can be seen puttering around on the Amity police boat. 
ANDY If you're beached, why are we doing this? For practice? 
MIKE Yeah. 
ANDY Then why are we futzing around the dock? We can make a few bucks working at the beach. 
Sean knocks something over, Mike snaps at him. 
MIKE Look -- if you're going to get in the way, you can just go home. 
SEAN I'm not in the way. Andy, am I in the way? 
ANDY You're always in the way. 
Marge joins them, scooping Sean up. 
MARGE This guy giving you any trouble? 
SEAN Put me down! 
ANDY Put him down in the water. 
MARGE (to Sean) You want to go out in my boat? 
SEAN Yeah. 
MIKE Would you take him? 
MARGE Sure. 
ANDY You've just made someone very happy. 
Marge and Sean go over to her Lightening. Brooke and Jackie come down the dock, dressed for sailing. 
BROOKE Mike! Are you going out? 
MIKE Maybe. 
JACKIE I thought you were grounded. 
MIKE I can go out if I want to. 
ANDY You can? 
JACKIE You going to the lighthouse? 
MIKE Why not? 
ANDY I could give you a dozen good reasons. 
MIKE (to Andy) Shut up. 
ANDY Okay, okay, don't say I didn't remind you. 
JACKIE Is there room on your boat for all of us? 
Mike looks: Andy, Jackie, Brooke, himself... Timmy moves in, sensing the chance of a lifetime. 
ANDY Well, we're pretty crowded, and I don't know when we're leaving... 
Timmy makes his move. 
TIMMY I've got room. 
BROOKE Great. (to Andy) That's okay -- I'll go with Timmy. 
TIMMY You will? 
BROOKE Sure. 
And she walks towards his boat, looking back for him to follow. He's dumbstruck by his sudden good fortune. 
TIMMY Fan-tas-tic! 
He runs to join her, untying mooring lines like crazy; they're together again at last for the first time. Andy is left shuffling with Mike and Jackie. 
JACKIE I'm ready. 
And she plops down in Mike's boat, ready to be taken. Anywhere. 
JACKIE Come on, you guys. 
DECK OF THE DIVING BOAT - DAY 
Andrews is on his side, bloody froth on his lips. One of the class is clinging to his legs, trying to arrest his convulsions. Sparky is holding his shoulders, trying to administer mouth-to-mouth. 
SPARKY Get us in! For Christ's sake, get us in! 
In his arms, Andrews writhes, pain knotting his limbs. 
Behind them, in the water, the fin surfaces, and casually turns towards... the ocean. The Shark is headed for the sea. And for the now distant Kids in their sailboats, dotting the horizon in their familiar bright colors. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. OCEAN - ED AND TINA'S SANDPIPER - DAY 
They are alone. In the middle distance, the rest of the Kids' sails can be seen, headed for the lighthouse in the distance. The Sandpiper's sails are luffing, they're making no headway. 
TINA You want to tack, or just leave her pointed up like this? 
ED (snuggling close) Just like this. 
TINA What about sailing? 
ED The tide's running. It'll take us to the light. 
TINA It'll take us to Budapest if you're not careful. 
Ed is lashing the rudder as they continue to drift with the current. 
ED First things first. 
He fumbles in a cooler chest, produces a bottle of wine. 
TINA What about the others? 
ED They'll be there when we get there. Might even have a fire started. 
TINA What're we going to do in the mean time? 
ED I dunno. We'll think of something. 
He pours the wine into the two paper cups. 
ED But first, a little juice... 
TINA And second? 
ED (kissing her) Mmmmmm. 
TINA (resisting) Wait a minute. Promise me something. 
ED Anything. Anything. 
TINA That you'll put down a blanket. I've got black and blue marks all over my butt, and my Mom's getting uptight about them. 
ED You got it. 
And he fumbles for a blanket in a locker, thumping and banging gear around as he rummages for it. Tina sips wine contentedly, satisfied to wait. 
UNDERWATER 
The Sandpiper's hull, alone above us, as the Shark rises with dreadful certainty, attracted by the erratic sounds of Ed's hasty search. 
ANGLE ON TINA - WATCHING THE OCEAN 
The terrible fin breaks the surface, about 20 yards out, then dips and disappears. Then, impossibly fast, the entire Sandpiper is lifted from underneath by a powerful surge, as the Shark lunges up against it from below, an unseen horror. 
Ed is knocked over the side, into the water. 
ANGLE ON ED 
as he breaks the surface, shaking the hair out of his eyes, trying to orient himself, finding the boat. He starts to swim for it, Tina extending an arm to help him climb aboard. 
ANGLE OVER THE GUNWALE, TOWARDS ED 
He has barely taken two strokes when a powerful force takes him from below the surface, rushing him towards us through the water. Tina screams. Before Ed can react to the pain, he is slammed face first into the boat. His jaw breaks, blood smears his nose and lip. 
His hands grab the wooden-cap rail with a death-grip. 
REVERSE 
Tina is staring down at the water, terror-stricken; Ed's arms and head are f.g., as he locks onto the boat with desperate hands. 
INSERT 
Ed's hands on the rail, knuckles white, an iron grip. With awful finality, the force pulls down, and the wood shatters and splits away as Ed's hands are pulled down and under by the awful force. 
TINA 
her mouth working silently, unable to scream, staring down at the blood and froth on the water, swirling in a grim eddy under her, the Sandpiper rocking gently in the diminishing swell. 
EXT. OCEAN - DAY - ESTABLISHING SHOT 
On the way to the lighthouse, but away from the harbor, the Kids are sailing in fairly close order: The sloops (Polo, Timmy, Marge) heeled well over in the stiff breeze, the faster cats (Mike, Larry, Donny, etc.) skimming around, tacking more often, faster and more maneuverable. 
CLOSE ON PATRICK AND LUCY 
LUCY Faster! Faster! 
PATRICK Coming about... 
She ducks under the boom, handling the jib sheets with easy familiarity. They come about and scoot off on a new tack. 
CLOSE ON POLO 
Reading the wind, trimming sail expertly, competent and alone. 
POLO (to a near-by boat) Great day! I think the wind's going to change... 
CLOSE ON TIMMY AND BROOKE 
ATTENDANT It's okay. We're taking care of him. 
The other attendant holds something out to Brody. Brody examines it; a scuba mouthpiece, bitten in two, useless. 
BRODY How'd this happen? 
SPARKY Bite reflex, like a spasm. 
BRODY When? 
HENDRICKS Right after, the Kids went out? 
ELLEN What Kids? Who went out? 
HENDRICKS All of them. Mike, Junior Vaughn, Brookie Peters, Pat, Lucy -- all that whole gang. 
ELLEN Mike? Our Mike? 
HENDRICKS Yep. Looked like they were headed to the lighthouse. 
BRODY How long ago? 
HENDRICKS About an hour, maybe two. (thinking) Let's see -- I came on about eight... 
Brody is gone, pushing through the crowd. 
THE POLICE BOAT 
Brody is casting off lines. Ellen is on the dock, watching him. 
ELLEN What're you doing? 
BRODY Going out. 
HENDRICKS Uh, Chief -- look. You're not Chief any more. 
Brody keeps working, making ready for sea. 
HENDRICKS I can't let you take her out. 
BRODY You can't stop me. 
Ellen is climbing aboard, taking off her heels. 
HENDRICKS Mrs. Brody, look -- if he can't go, then you can't go. Neither of you can go. 
ELLEN I'm going. 
BRODY Mike's out there. 
HENDRICKS But I signed for the boat. You're not authorized any more. 
Brody starts the engines with a roar, and slams it into reverse. The boat starts out of the slip, then lunges to a halt, shuddering on its still-fastened bow mooring line. 
BRODY Untie that rope. 
HENDRICKS Please. It's my job. 
ELLEN I'll do it. 
And she moves purposefully towards the boat cleat. 
HENDRICKS Mrs. Brody, please... 
Brody is shifting gears, the boat is crabbing sideways as he puts the helm hard over. It bumps the dock, hard. 
HENDRICKS You're too close. Back off. 
BRODY Goddamnit, Hendricks, untie the rope there. 
Hendricks goes to the bow, jumps aboard and frees the bow line. The boat slips into reverse, the water boiling as Brody guns it away from the dock. 
HENDRICKS Let me. Please. 
He takes the wheel, eases off on the rudder, and comes about, pointing the launch out to sea. 
ELLEN Hurry, please. 
HENDRICKS What the hell, they can't fire both of us -- someone's got to be in charge, right? Which way are we going? 
BRODY Find the Kids. The lighthouse -- you said something about the lighthouse. Get us there. 
WIDE ON THE HARBOR 
The Amity Police Boat, Brody, Ellen and Hendricks aboard, is headed under full power out to sea. Hendricks is pumping the horn, warning boats out of the way, ignoring the rules of the road; as small boats scatter out of the way, we can see the ambulance, red light flashing, pushing out slowly through the crowd at dockside. 
CUT TO: 
ABOARD THE AMITY POLICE BOAT - DAY 
As they clear the harbor mouth, Brody is on the radio, Ellen is crouching in the shelter of the deckhouse, Hendricks is steering. 
BRODY Amity Launch to Harbor Patrol, over. 
HARBOR PATROL (V.O.) (filtered) Harbor Patrol. Is that you, Brody? 
BRODY Affirmative. Can you get your chopper airborne? 
PATROL VOICE 10-4, in a few minutes. He's down checking a buoy in the Bay Channel. 
BRODY Get him the hell over to Amity Point, the old lighthouse. Right now. 
PATROL VOICE What for? 
BRODY There's a bunch of Kids day-sailing that way. Turn them back to port. 
PATROL VOICE That's it? 
BRODY That's it. Just do it, all right? 
It approaches the sailboats, losing altitude fast, rotor blades chuffing up a storm. 
The Pilot has his microphone to his lips, and his voice is blaring down at them. 
PILOT (V.O.) This is the Harbor Patrol. Return to port immediately. Return -- to -- port -- immediately. 
THE BOATS 
The Kids look at each other, some coming about awkwardly, others luffing, wondering what this is all about. 
ANDY (to Mike) Your dad must be really pissed. 
MIKE We better go back in. 
ANDY It's not going to be easy. 
JACKIE What's wrong? 
MIKE We're fighting wind and current. I though we'd be out longer, catch the incoming tide. 
ANDY Putz -- that won't be for hours. 
MIKE I was counting on hours. 
CHOPPER (V.O.) Return -- to -- port. 
MIKE We're trying, we're trying. 
He waves acknowledgement, and puts about. The others take their cue from him, and set a rough course back, but without much success. 
PATRICK AND LUCY 
LUCY Heading back? 
PATRICK Might as well. 
ANGLE ON THE THREE SLOOPS 
Polo, Timmy and Brooke, Marge and Sean. They see the faster catamarans come about and try to beat back. 
POLO They're turning around. 
LUCY Coming about, then. 
SEAN Are we going back? 
MARGE Going to try. Lighthouse, everybody... 
She puts about, the three of them start back towards the lighthouse, not making much headway. Doug's inflatable is the slowest, and he is now, by virtue of his position, at the head of the line beating back towards the island. 
DOUG'S BOAT 
The others in the b.g. 
DOUG Make way for the Carrier Enterprise! 
INSERT - A WEAK PATCH IN THE RUBBER 
It whistles and visibly leaks under the strain. 
DOUG 
looking down in dismay. 
DOUG Make that the Titanic. 
He rigs a little foot pump, and begins thumping away, trying to breath air back into the raft. 
INT. CHOPPER - LOOKING DOWN AT THE SAILBOATS 
PILOT Patrol One to Base. Looks like they're turning back. 
CONTROL All right, Patrol. Go back to work. You've wasted enough time. 
UNDERWATER 
Looking up at the scattered hulls of the sailboats, the turbulence from the low-flying chopper making a vast circular pattern of irregular vibrations. 
LOOKING UP AT THE CHOPPER 
It wheels around, and heads back towards land. 
CUT TO: 
ABOARD THE AMITY POLICE BOAT - DAY 
Rushing through the seas under full power. About three hundred yards ahead, a small, seemingly empty sailboat; Ed and Tina's Sandpiper. Further off, a day-sailing power cruiser, sport fishing. 
ELLEN Michael? 
BRODY It's not his boat. 
Hendricks maneuvers closer, slowing the engine, reversing in time to bring them alongside with a gentle bump. Ellen watches apprehensively as Brody drops into the little boat. 
ELLEN Be careful... 
HENDRICKS Anything? 
BRODY (on the Sandpiper) Nope... (he sees something) Hold on... 
Brody moves around on the deck of the Sandpiper, until he discovers Tina, cowering in shock; a sudden revealing of a terrorized victim. 
BRODY Tina! 
TINA (a moan) N-o-o-o-o-o-o... 
BRODY It's okay, it's okay. What's the matter? Tina? Honey? Hey -- 
TINA No! It's still there! 
MARGE How about a skyhook? 
DOUG You sail your boat, I'll sail mine. 
A fin rises partially, almost invisible to most of the kids, but Mike notices it, believing it to be a porpoise. 
MIKE Hey, Fetterman -- You got company. 
DOUG Company? The place is a mess... 
Before anyone can react, the shape rises behind Doug, striking his raft a terrible blow. 
DOUG Whoops. 
CUT TO: 
THE OTHERS, WATCHING 
Not making any headway themselves, they casually watch the class clown, wondering what he's up to this time. 
DOUG'S BOAT 
a distance from the rest. It shakes, then blows up as big teeth grip it from below. Doug goes flying into the drink. 
The Shark has the inflatable in his teeth, and is shaking it from side to side. Doug's eyes bug out as he sees what's going on. He begins treading water, backing away as fast as he can, waving his arm in the air frantically -- "pick me up, quick..." 
MIKE'S BOAT 
MIKE Doug's down! 
He sails to where Doug is being carried along by the current. 
The inflatable is a mess -- shredded rubber and dead engine; the Shark didn't like it. 
ANDY Doug! This way! 
Doug carefully -- oh, so carefully -- strokes over to where Mike and Andy can pull him abroad. Some of the others sail closer to get a look. 
PATRICK What was that about? 
MARGE You okay? 
LUCY What was that? 
LARRY So much for the rubber duck. 
THE GROUP, DRIFTING TOGETHER 
This incident hasn't yet touched them -- no one actually saw what it was, except Doug, who's never been serious about anything. Until now. 
DOUG A shark ate my boat. 
BOB Come on. 
DOUG I'm telling you, a goddamn shark ate my goddamn boat! 
ANDY If he liked your boat, I got some sneakers he'll love. 
There's nervous laughter from all around as they examine the remains of Doug's inflatable. Some of those jagged rents could be made by teeth... 
KIDS (ad lib) ...Jeez -- what did that?... A porpoise, maybe...Nah, killer whale... I think he snagged it... I hate to pop his balloon... (Etc.) 
ANGLE ON MIKE'S BOAT 
Doug's inflatable is draped over the tip of one hull, forward. 
Without warning, the Shark hits. Screams, terror, confusion. 
Mike, Andy, Jackie into the water. 
CLOSE ON MIKE 
His head bangs on a metal fitting as the boat turns over. 
ON THE GROUP 
Patrick and Lucy ram into Timmy's boat, locking into it, knocking Timmy into the water as Brooke screams. 
CONFUSION 
As the following events take place: 
--  Larry's red cat rams and locks onto Mike's Tornado. 
--  Marge's boat capsizes, putting Sean and Marge into the drink. 
--  Marge scrambles up on the over-turned hull, pulling Sean up with her, just in time. 
--  Polo, under full sail, scoops Mike out of the water before the Shark can get to him. 
--  The Shark dips out of sight. 
SURFACE, WIDE OVER THE STERN OF POLO'S BOAT 
showing the results of the turmoil: 
ANGLE ON THE SURVIVORS 
As they make ineffectual, frightened moves towards grouping together, Andy is the first to gain any composure. 
ANDY Raft up! Raft 'em up! 
He reaches towards a drifting line, and pulls Timmy's Doughdish towards them, tying it off as it comes close. 
LARRY Tie off to your strongest point. 
PATRICK Anyone need an extra line? 
Polo has Mike and Timmy aboard his boat.  Timmy is looking up from examining Mike's dazed body. 
PATRICK First we got to get there. 
LARRY How're we going to do that floating on this garbage...? 
BOB Anyone got another set of sails? 
The Kids scramble to rig whatever canvas is available. 
SEAN Is that big thing still out there? 
MARGE Shhhh. 
CUT TO: 
HELICOPTER (AERIAL) FLY-BY 
A panorama of open ocean; a quick fly-by to orient us: First, Cable Junction, then, a mile or so ahead, the raft. 
THE RAFT 
More sail, some improvised rigging, Patrick and Lucy trimming what there is, trying to steer the clumsy contraption. From afar, the distant sound of an approaching chopper. 
LARRY Hey! 
BOB (waving) Over here! 
The Kids react with enthusiasm to the arrival of the rescue chopper. 
ANDY Don't everyone jump around! 
But they ignore him. The copter is descending. 
INT. COPTER - DAY 
A one-man light spotter; the space next to the pilot cluttered with tools and floats, lashed in place. Below, seen through the plastic bubble, the raft growing larger as the chopper sets down. 
PILOT Air One to Base. I have a positive location on that sailing party. Disabled and adrift... (he checks chart on his knee board) ...about 3/4 miles west of Cable Junction, wind and current carrying them just about due east. I count ten juveniles. 
THE RAFT 
The helicopter is creating a lot of turbulence as it sets down, a huge circular pattern of prop-wash on the surface as the rotors slow to a halt. The Kids are waving and jubilant. 
ANGLE ON THE COPTER 
As the Pilot unbuckles, opens the door, and steps out on one pontoon; he speaks through a bullhorn. 
PILOT Everyone okay? Any injuries? 
The Kids ad-lib in the affirmative. 
ANDY Can you put us on Cable Junction? 
PILOT I got no room for passengers. 
ANDY How about a tow? Can you rig that? 
The Pilot nods. Larry heaves a line to him, the Pilot catches it and makes it fast to a convenient tie-off on the undercarriage. 
LARRY As soon as you get us on the island, you got to call in. My dad's the mayor... 
ANDY (interrupting) There's a shark... 
The other Kids all chime in, adding their ad-lib shouts describing what happened, calling for help, etc. It's all a noisy jumble, the Pilot ignores it, trying to do his job. 
ANGLE ON THE RAFT 
The Kids all shouting at once; Jackie is screaming. 
JACKIE You have to take us off! You have to! Why don't you take us! 
DOUG (calming her) It's an observation spotter, he doesn't have the room... 
ANGLE ON THE PILOT 
He finishes tying off, and yells through his bullhorn at the Kids. 
PILOT Listen. I'm going to give you an assist to get you on Cable Junction. Then I'll call in, and get the Coast Guard to send a cutter. Hang on to something. 
He climbs into his bubble, shuts the door, gives the Kids a "thumbs up," and starts the engine. 
QUICK CUTS - RAFT AND CHOPPER 
Engine turning over. 
A line tied off to one of the ringbolts on an overturned hull; it pulls taut out of the water. 
INT. CHOPPER, THE PILOT INTENT ON HIS JOB. 
The raft, Kids watching in fascination and anticipation. 
The whole operation, getting under way. 
UNDERWATER 
looking up at pontoons, wreckage, wind turbulence on the surface, the heavy "thud-thud-thud" of chopper blades. 
WIDE ON THE RAFT AND CHOPPER 
In the f.g., the fin rises, and starts for the scene. 
Follow it. 
CLOSE ON THE CHOPPER 
as it starts to lift, inexplicably. The Pilot reacts as; 
THE SHARK 
attacks one of the pontoons, biting down on it, clamping great scarred jaws onto the bulbous floats. 
CUT TO: 
ON THE SURFACE - THE RAFT 
A parallel struggle for survival, as the current separates Sean from the other Kids; Marge is gone, the little boy is clinging alone to the free-floating Lightening. 
PATRICK Sean! Sean! 
ANDY Don't move! 
SEAN Andy! Please help! Help! 
ON THE SURFACE - A DISTANCE AWAY 
Copter wreckage is bubbling up from underneath, like a submarine destroyed by depth charges; an oil slick, pieces of broken blade, a seat cushion, then, suddenly, the Pilot, and Marge, almost choked to death, their air run out. They cling to a section of pontoon, panting, looking around with oxygen-starved eyes. 
They are alone on the ocean; a half-mile away, the distant sails of the broken raft, and the low-lying shape of Cable Junction. Safe, for now... 
CUT TO: 
BRODY - ALONE IN THE POLICE BOAT - DAY 
He throttles down, and the boat slumps in the water. He looks around, sees nothing, in all directions. He hits his radio. 
BRODY Harbor Air, this is Brody. Air One, come in. 
Static, no answer. He tries a couple of times, checking the knobs and dials to make sure the unit's working. 
BRODY Harbor Air, do you read? Over? 
PATROL VOICE Brody? This is Patrol Base. 
The familiar voice is tinged with annoyance. He's had a long shift, and nothing's going right. 
BRODY Where the hell is Air One? 
PATROL VOICE That's what I'd like to know. Lost transmission at Cable Junction. 
BRODY Did he raise the Kids? 
PATROL VOICE Last transmission said ten juveniles. 
BRODY Yeah? Then what? 
PATROL VOICE Then nothing. If you see him, tell him to switch to an operational frequency, or give me a status report yourself. 
BRODY Did you say Cable Junction? 
PATROL VOICE That's what he said. 
BRODY When? 
PATROL VOICE 1530 hours. Might still be there. Base out. 
Brody revs up, and powers out, headed for Cable Junction. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. OCEAN - DAY - THE RAFT 
Sean is crying on his isolated perch, clinging to the upturned keel. The other Kids are throwing a rope, trying to get him back. Patrick heaves, and misses. 
LARRY Sean! Catch the rope! 
BOB The rope! The rope! 
The others shoot fearful glances at the waters. 
PATRICK He's got to help or it won't work. 
LUCY Sean, baby, please... 
Sean is ignoring the efforts to rescue him, paralyzed by fear, he shivers alone. Jackie is near catatonia herself, Brooke and Doug trying to soothe her. 
JACKIE It killed her. It ate her. 
BROOKE Shh. Shhh... 
DOUG It's okay, it's okay... 
ANDY Sean! Listen! Listen to me, Sean. 
The kid looks up dully. 
ANDY Goddamn it, Sean, you listen to me or I will kick your ass, do you hear me? 
LUCY Listen to Andy, Sean. 
ANDY We're throwing a rope and you better catch it, hear? 
Sean nods. The other Kids are encouraged. The rope is thrown -- it misses. 
ANDY (to Bob) Keep an eye out for that fish. 
Bob climbs to a vantage point, watching. 
LARRY Throw it. 
ANDY Sean! Catch it! 
Another miss. In his haste to help, Larry overreaches to fish the trailing rope out of the water, and falls headlong into the sea. Shrieks of fright from the others. 
LUCY Larry! 
He scrambles out, hardly wet, that's how fast he's moving. 
Finally -- Patrick takes the crucial throw, and the rope practically knocks Sean off his perch, but he clutches and holds it. As Andy carefully calls instructions, Sean secures the rope and the others carefully, carefully begin to pull him in. 
ANGLE - ON SEAN 
Brody jerks the mooring line holding them together, freeing it. He starts for his controls, obsessed. 
MIKE Dad, I'm sorry... 
BRODY Stay here. Don't go anywhere. Just stay here. 
He indicates the lighthouse, then guns his engine. 
BRODY Stay at the lighthouse! 
He roars off, headed towards Cable Junction. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. OCEAN - DAY - THE RAFT 
approaching Cable Junction the rafted boats are drifting towards the Cable Junction.  Larry, Patrick and Andy are working on improvised tiller lines to a jury rudder made out of wreckage. Lucy has another line out to a sea anchor, trying to slow their drift. 
ANDY Bring her to port a little. That's it -- steady. 
DOUG I think we're changing course a little. 
BROOKE Can we land on it? 
LUCY If we can get to it. 
JACKIE We're going to die. 
BROOKE (comforting her) It's all right, we're okay. 
ANDY More to port. 
BOB It's all the way over. 
ANDY Shit. 
SEAN Are we going to go on the island? 
BROOKE You bet, kiddo. 
ANDY (the realist) I don't know. 
LARRY What the hell, we're steering for it. 
DOUG The wind drift is lateral. 
LARRY What's that mean? 
DOUG Sideways -- For every yard we go this way, we also slide sideways this way... 
His hands illustrate the predicament. 
LUCY But we had it! We were headed right for it! 
ANDY Shit. Shit, shit, shit! 
JACKIE We're going to miss it! 
The others are silent. It's true. 
ANGLE ON THE RAFT 
Larry, Bob and Brooke try to alter its course by padding. 
ANDY Don't! 
DOUG Stop paddling! 
LUCY But the island! 
ANDY The Shark. 
They freeze, as the raft grinds against something. 
UNDERWATER 
The inverted mast of one of the wrecked boats is snagged on the rocks on the bottom. 
ANGLE ON THE RAFT 
as it slows, then stops, hung up from below. 
BROOKE What is it? 
ANDY We're hung up on something. 
DOUG Maybe the bottom. 
JACKIE (hysteria) It's that thing. It's going to kill us now... We're going to die! 
LARRY Shut up! Just shut Up! 
BROOKE Leave her alone! 
BOB Lighten up, man... 
LARRY It's bad enough without her freaking out. 
PATRICK She's hysterical, goddamn it! 
LUCY Don't yell at her! 
The group dissolves in bitter exchanges. No one is rational. 
Lucy is the first to notice something... 
LUCY Wait a minute! Listen! Listen! 
The group subsides, only Jackie is left, keening to herself. 
He sees the winch and hooks on his launch, and makes the towline fast to the steel winch cable; puts it in neutral. 
The Kids haul their line, trying to bring the steel cable to them. 
The shark rams their raft, impatient now. Screams and scrambling as they let go their line and try to avoid the beast. Brooke huddles with Sean, Jackie cowers alone. Larry is lashing his big buck knife to a pole, an improvised weapon. 
ANGLE ON THE WINCH LINE 
Unattended, it drops into the water. 
THE KIDS 
ANDY Get the cable in! Pull! 
They do, but now the winch cable is snagged under the surface. 
It comes taut, but doesn't budge. Brody watches, helpless for the moment. 
BRODY Son of a bitch is stuck! 
BRODY 
climbs back onto the boat, starts the winch engine, trying to pull the cable free. 
THE SHARK 
on the offensive now, takes an outrigger pontoon, biting it, tearing it off the raft, shaking everything. 
ON THE RAFT 
the Kids react to this fresh attack. 
DOUG It's killing us! 
JACKIE I don't want to die! Mommy! 
IN THE BOAT 
The winch smokes and stalls, the weight it's pulling almost too much. 
BRODY Come on, you bastard, come on, pull. Pull! 
THE RAFT 
bursts apart from the center as the Shark lunges up through the canvas trampoline of the Sizzler. The Kids, screaming, fall into the water as the attack forces the fragile structure into pieces. Only Sean, Brooke, and Jackie are left on the remaining segment. 
ANGLE ON BRODY 
watching the destruction, seeing Sean practically alone in the water. 
BRODY Sean! Hang on! 
He looks around the deck frantically, spots a rubber emergency inflatable in its case. He wrestles it off its brackets, and breaks the seals urgently. He hits the auto-inflate. 
BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW - SEAN 
Alone on the raft, Brooke and Jackie helpless nearby, the other Kids flailing in the water. The huge bulk of the Shark, fin cutting the water as it closes in on the confusion. 
IN THE WATER 
While Brody inflates the rubber raft and throws it in the water, the Kids scramble for safety, swimming for their lives. Each one is sure this moment is going to be his last. 
ANDY Get on the rocks! 
DOUG Swim for it! 
Andy is pulling himself towards the boat, scrambling up on the exposed wooden hull. 
PATRICK Lucy! Look out! 
ANGLE ON LUCY AND BOB 
As she looks over her shoulder and screams -- the monster is sliding past her, intent on Bob. The rough hide scrapes her, tearing her clothes, leaving raw bleeding lacerations on her torso. 
LUCY I'm bleeding! 
Larry and Patrick help her towards the rocks. 
BOB Help! 
He's clinging to a piece of broken boat; the Shark lunges at him. 
INSERT - WINCH 
grinding, smoking, hauling something out of the water -- heavy, slimy, dripping metal cable, the main powerline from the mainland! 
BRODY IN THE WATER 
paddling the raft towards Sean with desperate strokes, heedless of the danger around him. 
BRODY Hang on! Just hang on! 
He fights to see in the gathering gloom. Suddenly, a strange glare snaps on, then more illumination, in a series of escalating clicks. 
CABLE JUNCTION 
Silhouetted against the evening sky. Automatic timers are turning on navigation and worklights, illuminating the barren rocks and rusty steel with their glare -- throwing dark shadows, putting the surrounding water into black limbo by their contract. 
ANGLE ON BRODY 
straining to see what's going on. Looking for his son. 
SEAN (O.S.) Dad! Help! Daddy! 
BRODY I'm coming! 
He looks around desperately, sees Andy safe on the launch. 
BRODY Andy! Use the lights! The lights!

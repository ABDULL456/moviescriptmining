DEADPOOL 
Written by 
Rhett Reese & Paul Wernick 
Final Shooting Script - November 16, 2015 
OVER BLACK. Low volume, through a tinny speaker, JUICE NEWTON'S `ANGEL OF THE MORNING.' 
FADE UP ON: 
1   EXT./INT.   TAXI CAB - MORNING                                        1 
DEADPOOL, in full DRESS REDS and MASK, quietly FIDGETS in the BACK SEAT of a TAXI CAB as it proceeds along a CITY FREEWAY. 
Deadpool adjusts the two KATANAS strapped to his back. Rolls the WINDOWS up, down, up. Tries futilely to untwist the seatbelt, then LUNGES forward, locking it up. Rifles through a tourist booklet and tears out a HAUNTED SEGWAY TOUR coupon. The CABBIE, young, thin, brown, glances back and forth from the rear view to the road to the rear view. 
DEADPOOL Kinda lonesome back here. 
CUT TO: DEADPOOL, WEDGING himself through the opening between the back seat and front. His two katanas don't cooperate, catching on the Plexiglas, stalling him mid-torso. 
DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Little help? 
The cabbie grabs Deadpool's hand and pulls him through to the front. Deadpool's head rests upside down on the bench seat as he maneuvers his legs through. The cabbie turns the helping hand into a HANDSHAKE, then turns down the Juice. 
CABBIE Dopinder. 
DEADPOOL (still upside-down) Pool. Deadpool. 
Dopinder is remarkably UNAFFECTED by the lunatic in his cab. 
DOPINDER Why the fancy red suit, Mr. Pool? 
DEADPOOL It's like Christmas Day, Dopinder. Been waiting one thousand eight hundred twenty- two days, three hours... (checks `Adventure Time' watch) ...and thirty-six minutes for this shit. 
(CONTINUED) Deadpool    Final Shooting Script   11/16/15 1   CONTINUED:                                                             1 
DEADPOOL turns himself RIGHT-SIDE-UP in the front seat. He is YOKED to the gills and ARMED to the teeth. TWIN KATANAS. TWIN DESERT EAGLE .50 CALIBER PISTOLS. 
Deadpool grabs Dopinder's OPEN BAG of CORN NUTS. Dopinder isn't quick enough to stop him. Deadpool gazes out the window onto the city - a teeming, sooty urban sprawl that looks almost... pre-post-apocalyptic. 
Deadpool turns up his MASK. Dopinder catches a GLIMPSE of the bottom of a SCARRED face. And quickly looks AWAY. Deadpool eats the CORN NUTS. CRUNCH. CRUNCH. Points. 
DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Nice. 
Dopinder eyes his DAFFODIL DAYDREAM AIR FRESHENER and takes a deep breath through his nose. 
DOPINDER Smells good, no? 
DEADPOOL Not the Daffodil Daydream.      The girl. 
A PICTURE of a young INDIAN WOMAN is taped to the dash. 
DOPINDER Ah yes. Gita. She is quite lovely. She was supposed to make me a very agreeable wife. Mom and Dad chose her rather excellently. But Gita's heart has been stolen by my cousin Bandhu. Bandhu is as dishonorable as he is attractive. 
DEADPOOL Dopinder, I'm starting to think I'm in this cab for a reason. 
DOPINDER Because you hailed it? 
DEADPOOL No, my slender brown friend... to give you one crucial piece of advice: Love... is a beautiful thing. When it finds you, the whole world smells like Daffodil Daydream. 
Deadpool's own heartbreak is palpable.        He takes another deep, cleansing BREATH. 
(CONTINUED) Deadpool    Final Shooting Script   11/16/15 1   CONTINUED: (2)                                                        1 
DEADPOOL (CONT'D) So hold onto love tight. Go at Bandhu hard. Get Gita back. Or else... the whole world will taste like Mama June after hot yoga. 
DOPINDER And how does Ms. Mama June taste? 
DEADPOOL Like two hobos making love under a drizzle of Limburger- I could go all day like this. Point is, bad. 
Deadpool chucks the bag of Corn Nuts into the back seat and pulls out his PISTOLS. He starts CHAMBERING shells into two magazines. 
Suddenly, he frantically pats himself down, like a Hollywood agent who can't find his phone. 
DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Shiiiit. My extra mags! I usually leave them right by the door so I'll trip over them! Someone must've moved them... 
2   INT.   DEADPOOL'S LAIR - DAY                                          2 
A blind late-70's AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMAN in a purple floral dress enters the front door, falls as she trips over an `I *HEART* HELLO KITTY' DUFFEL BAG of AMMUNITION, PICKS it UP, and CARRIES it OFF. 
3   INT./EXT.   TAXI CAB - MORNING                                        3 
DOPINDER Shall we turn back? 
DEADPOOL No time. Not today. (slides in last bullets) Ten, eleven, twelve... or bust. (chambers a shell into each gun, looks up) Right here! 
The cab SCREECHES to a stop on the shoulder of the highest FREEWAY in a massive INTERCHANGE of freeways. Dopinder halts the meter and hands Deadpool his CARD. 
DEADPOOL watches as the convoy approaches. He CASUALLY gets up as if standing up out of an easy chair... 
DEADPOOL On your mark, get set, go, let me go, let me shoop... 
He PIROUETTES, and DROPS an entire level DOWN... 
8   INT. ESCALADE - MORNING                                               8 
THROUGH the SUNROOF of an ESCALADE.     SMASH! 
There are FOUR HUGE BAD-ASSES inside the S.U.V., two in front, two behind. Deadpool lands back-middle in a HAILSTORM of GLASS. He stuns the men to both sides with elbows to the face as he raises his arms in greeting. 
DEADPOOL ¡Hola! ¡Me llamo Piscina De La Muerte! (subtitled, in YELLOW:) Hello! My name is the Pool of Death. There's no easy way to say this. I'm pregnant, Trevor. (ALT:) Any of you seen Green Lantern? Me neither. 
BOOM! MAYHEM ERUPTS as the two men in back find themselves sharing a phone booth with the TASMANIAN DEVIL: ELBOWS. FOREARMS. KNEES. CRACKING. CRUNCHING. SCREAMING. 
From BEHIND, the Escalade BUCKS and BOUNCES down the road on its suspension, almost CARTOON-LIKE. 
A brutal punch spins Deadpool UPSIDE-DOWN, and he rolls with it, uses his FEET to BREAK the man's NECK. The other man stomps on his head, then drags him up and SMUSHES Deadpool's face into the seat's premium trim. 
DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Rich... Corinthian... Leather. 
Deadpool HURLS the man through THROUGH the TAILGATE WINDOW. 
The man clutches the TAILGATE, DRAGGED behind the S.U.V. Deadpool sticks his head between the two guys in FRONT.

DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Scuse, por favor! 
The DRIVER SLAMS Deadpool's head into the console repeatedly. 
DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Ow.   Ow.   Ow. Ow. Ow. 
Deadpool squirms away and WRESTLES VIOLENTLY with the guy in the PASSENGER SEAT. 
He GRABS the PASSENGER SEAT-BELT, TIES it around the guy's ANKLE, and KICKS him out the PASSENGER SIDE DOOR. The guy's HEAD and SHOULDERS SMACK pavement, where he's DRAGGED mercilessly by his ANKLE - a modern COWBOY whose boot just got stuck in his horse's STIRRUP. 
Deadpool grabs the driver by the HAIR on the BACK of his HEAD and BANGS his FOREHEAD into: 
The horn. HONK. HONK. The stereo. Every time the driver's forehead SMACKS the face of the stereo, the RADIO STATION CHANGES: 
MARIACHI. DR. DREW. MONSTER TRUCK COMMERCIAL ('SUNDAY, SUNDAY, SUNDAY!'). One more SMACK to get us back to MARIACHI. 
Deadpool looks in the REAR VIEW MIRROR to see the man in back CRAWL up the tailgate. 
Deadpool PUSHES in the Cadillac's CIGARETTE LIGHTER. 
Back to the DRIVER. Deadpool BASHES his face into the DRIVER's SIDE WINDOW. THUMP. THUMP. THUMP. 
We're now OUTSIDE the Escalade, seeing the driver's expression take on a ridiculous silly-putty-esque grimace of pain every time it's MUSHED into the glass. 
The man in back scrambles forward. The CIGARETTE LIGHTER POPS OUT. Deadpool YANKS the EMERGENCY BRAKE. The man in back LAUNCHES forward and SMACKS the DASHBOARD. 
Deadpool STABS the now ORANGE-HOT lighter into the man's forehead, burning the COIL PATTERN into his skin. The man SCREAMS. 
DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Loved your work in Daredevil. 
Deadpool stuffs the lighter INTO the man's mouth and CLAMPS his hand over it. 
(CONTINUED) Deadpool   Final Shooting Script   11/16/15 8     CONTINUED: (2)                                                         8 
The man hollers in muffled agony. A MOTORCYCLE has pulled AHEAD of the ESCALADE and now sits, STOPPED, in its path. 
The helmeted RIDER OPENS FIRE with a SUB-MACHINE GUN. 
Deadpool has one hand grasped on the back of the driver's neck, still mashing his face into the window glass, and the OTHER hand still clamped over the second man's mouth. He plants both FEET on the steering wheel and `drives,' spinning the wheel, sending the S.U.V. into... 
...a ROLL.    The Escalade goes ENDO, SOMERSAULTING WILDLY. 
Suddenly, the ACTION BEGINS TO SLOW... 
The motorcycle RIDER tries to bail out. NO LUCK. The tumbling Escalade PLOWS RIGHT INTO him AND his bike. 
Parts scatter off the motorcycle, including its CHAIN. The RIDER continues to SQUEEZE off ROUNDS as he goes FLYING. 
Inside the Escalade, Deadpool goes SPIN-CYCLE. The DRIVER flies through the sunroof, tearing out its remaining glass. BLOOD spatters. The other man spits out the glowing CIGARETTE LIGHTER. The guy whose ankle is still tangled in the seat-belt FLAILS through the air like a rag-doll, AHAB tied to MOBY DICK. 
The action CONTINUES to SLOW... until it FREEZES. 
The camera swoops in to Deadpool's face, upside down. 
HE TURNS HIS HEAD TO CAMERA FOR THE FIRST TIME, BREAKING THE FOURTH WALL, THE ONLY THING IN THE SCENE THAT'S MOVING: 
DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Shit.   Did I leave the stove on? 
We RAMP back UP to FULL SPEED. The S.U.V. CARTWHEELS. The guy's ankle untangles from the seat-belt. He FLIES high toward a big HIGHWAY EXIT SIGN and... SPLAT... out of frame. 
The RIDER's NECK is SLICED by the flying MOTORCYCLE CHAIN. 
The bike WHIZZES PAST safely, firing bullets, DEADPOOL follows, leaping high, flipping over the S.U.V. 
He lands smoothly the other side, right BEHIND a thug who's looking in the other direction as he sneaks around the car. 
Deadpool SHRUGS and SHOOTS him in the BACK of the HEAD at POINT BLANK RANGE. 
DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Six. 
The shell tumbles to the ground, falls still.         `00006' 
Deadpool opens the Escalade.       His target is NOT THERE. 
BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG. Deadpool is nearly BROUGHT DOWN by a particularly big thug with a particularly big AK-47. 
He dives behind another Escalade, takes a moment to search the interior through the windows... and then flinches as AK- 47 bullets pass THROUGH the skin of the S.U.V. around him. 
(CONTINUED) Deadpool   Final Shooting Script     11/16/15 9   CONTINUED: (2)                                                        9 
One of the bullets lands in DEADPOOL'S BICEP. Deadpool yelps, in pain... then stuffs some of his torn red suit fabric into the hole to staunch the bleeding. 
Then he scrambles AROUND the S.U.V., trying to close the distance to this guy through a WITHERING BARRAGE of fire. 
Another of the AK's slugs SLICES a swath out of the mask on Deadpool's head, SINGING his hair. 
DEADPOOL. Fuck.   You. 
Deadpool lands in FRONT of the thug. The thug pulls his trigger again, only to - CLICK - realize he's OUT of BULLETS. 
DEADPOOL Someone's not counting.    Cinco. 
The bullet HITS the thug in the throat.       `00005' 
DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Me gusta cinco. 
Deadpool STRIDES past the fallen thug, pawing at his singed hair - ow - and then out of sheer, pumped-up ANGER... 
...turns and PUMPS TWO MORE SUPERFLUOUS BULLETS into him. 
DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Four.   Three. Stupid. Worth it. 
The SILVER-HELMETED MOTORCYCLE RIDER makes another pass, FIRING. Deadpool ducks behind the S.U.V. again. 
20 yards away, a GROUP of thugs TAKE COVER behind the final S.U.V. One pulls out a HAND-GRENADE, RAISES HIS ARM to throw. 
DEADPOOL (CONT'D) (chuckles) Number two... 
Deadpool FIRES, SHOOTING the GRENADE in the thug's FIST. BOOM! The whole CLUSTER of THUGS drops. 
Deadpool emerges from behind the S.U.V., feeling victorious. 
He approaches the final S.U.V. and throws open the doors to search, expecting to find his target at last. 
Inside is a rumpled orange prison coverall, but NOT the PRISONER. Deadpool gets childishly angry.

DEADPOOL (CONT'D) What the shit-biscuit! Where you at, Francis? 
Worse, CLICK-CLACK.    The distinctive COCKING of SHOTGUNS. 
3 final THUGS stand on the freeway, lined up perpendicular to Deadpool, SHOULDER-TO-SHOULDER, FIRING BENELLI COMBAT SHOTGUNS.    BAM! BAM! BAM! 
Deadpool ducks behind the S.U.V. and raises a PISTOL. We ZOOM IN through the CHAMBER to spy the last BULLET, POISED in front of the FIRING PIN: 
Deadpool thinks, then LEAPS from behind the `SCLADE, TWISTS forward and right. 
All 3 THUGS FIRE again.    BUCKSHOT rips into DEADPOOL's BACK. 
But he LANDS so that all 3 men are now parallel to him... 
...in A SINGLE-FILE LINE. 
DEADPOOL (CONT'D) One. 
BOOM! We're with the FINAL BULLET as it HURTLES from the gun and passes THROUGH the first man's head... then the SECOND man's head... and SMACKS the third man in the forehead. 
This third man, the BIGGEST THUG YET, HITS the DECK. 
Deadpool puts his mouth to his pistol barrel, INHALES... and then EXHALES smoke through the pores of his mask. 
DEADPOOL (CONT'D) I'm touching myself tonight. 
But then, as if by magic, the third thug STIRS... and STANDS. 
The SLUG has LODGED partway in his FOREHEAD, having lost just enough momentum that it didn't make it all the way through. 
The thug sneers, plucks out the slug, wipes away some blood, and rolls up his SLEEVES. 
DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Really?     Rolling up the sleeves? 
MERCHANT I don't have a cat! 
WADE Then whose kitty-litter did I just shit in? (turns to Jeremy) Anyhoo, you by chance know a Meghan Orlovsky? Getting that right? Orlovsky? Orloskvy? Do you? 
Jeremy manages a timid little NOD. 
WADE (CONT'D) Good.   `Cause she knows you. 
Wade holsters the pistol and WHIPS out a HUNTING KNIFE. He twirls it adeptly... but instead of holding it to Jeremy's neck... CUTS himself a SLICE of PIZZA. 
WADE (CONT'D) What situation isn't improved by pizza? 
Wade shovels half the slice into his mouth, revealing an Army SPECIAL FORCES TATTOO on his forearm: A SKULL WEARING A GREEN BERET, BACKED BY A BLADE, AND THE WORDS `DE OPPRESSO LIBER' (official motto of the U.S. Army Special Forces). 
WADE (CONT'D) (through chews) Jeremy, I belong to a group of guys who take a dime to beat a fella down. (cuts another pizza slice) Little Meghan's not made of money, but lucky her, I've got a soft spot. 
Wade brings the next pizza slice over to Merchant. Wade nearly hands it to him but lets go too soon. The slice falls flat - pineapple down - onto the floor at Merchant's feet. 
JEREMY B-but I'm- 
WADE (returns to Jeremy) A stalker. Threats hurt, Jer. Though not nearly as bad as serrated steel. 
Wade pokes the end of his knife into Jeremy's chest, pinning him against the wall. 
WADE (CONT'D) So keep away from Meghan.       We cool? 
(CONTINUED) Deadpool    Final Shooting Script     11/16/15 10   CONTINUED: (4)                                                          10 
JEREMY Y-yeah. 
A beat. In a huge ANTI-CLIMAX, Wade deftly twirls his knife AWAY from Jeremy's chest, SPINS it on his finger, and JAMS it back into its SLEEVE. 
WADE Then we're done. 
JEREMY W-we are? 
WADE Soft spot, remember? But even look in her general direction again? You'll learn in the worst of ways. (pats Jeremy's cheek) I've got some hard spots too. (pauses) That came out wrong. Or did it? 
11   EXT.   SKATE PARK - NIGHT - PAST                                        11 
SKATE PUNKS carve on ramps built into the sides of a highway underpass. A group of TEEN GIRLS are perched at the bottom of the nearby stairs, texting each other from inches away. An old-fashioned GHETTO BLASTER bangs `SHOOP.' 
SALT & PEPA I love you in your big jeans. 
GIRLS (join chorus) You give me nice dreams.     You make me wanna scream... 
Boom. A PIZZA BOX lands at their feet.          On top of it lands a POLAROID PICTURE. 
WADE (O.S.) "Oooo, oooo, oooo!" 
A FRIZZY-HAIRED EMO GIRL picks up the Polaroid... of a terrified JEREMY holding another pizza box that has been cut into a heart, the words `I'm Sorry' scrawled onto it, a PEE- STAIN on his JEANS, and a laughing WADE photo-bombing with the knife to his neck. She looks UP to see: 
Wade bobbing to the music. 
WADE (CONT'D) You've seen the last of Jeremy. 
(CONTINUED) Deadpool    Final Shooting Script   11/16/15 11    CONTINUED:                                                              11 
The girl - MEGHAN ORLOVSKY - leaps up and HUGS Wade tight. 
WADE (CONT'D) That's why we do it. 
GIRL #2 Hey, think you could fuck up my step-dad? 
GIRL #3 How `bout Vice Principal Renwiki? 
WADE (suddenly serious) What'd he do to you? 
GIRL #3 Suspended me for smoking. 
WADE (turns to go) Good for him! Sorry, ladies. Me no dig cigs. And I may look mean. But if I give a guy a pavement facial? He earned it. 
Wade gives Meghan a smile, turns to leave. 
MEGHAN Hey.   Thanks. You're my hero. 
The word catches Wade like a punch to the gut.         Hero? 
WADE That I ain't. 
Wade doesn't turn back, walking through the swooping skaters. 
A12   EXT.   SISTER MARGARET'S - NIGHT - PAST                                 A12 
A grimy SIGN on a grimier brick building reads:         `SISTER MARGARET'S SCHOOL FOR WAYWARD GIRLS.' 
12    INT.   SISTER MARGARET'S - NIGHT - PAST                                 12 
Inside, society's DREGS. Chief among them, BOOTHE: a HUGE, menacing hipster with a BOY SCOUT CAP and MASSIVE HANDLEBAR MOUSTACHE. He's got some DUDE's fingers splayed out on the bar, jabbing a KNIFE POINT between them as fast as he can. 
Weasel looks up a the board, where `WADE' has claimed: `BIEBER, J.' 
WADE The Biebs. But I'm probably wrong. Nothing bad ever happens to teen stars who make 80 mil a year and think they're immune to the pitfalls of addiction and consequence. He'll be fine. (raises shot, yells) Drinks on me, soldiers of fortune! 
MERCENARIES Hooah! 
VANESSA Whoa, whoa... 
Wade turns to see a woman on his other side: VANESSA. Brunette. Silver-blue eyes. Tank. Tiny jean-shorts. 
VANESSA (CONT'D) Sure you wanna shoot your whole wad? 
Wade looks Vanessa all the way up and down... then holds up his PINKIE. 
WADE Tight. 
Vanessa raises her own pinkie.         Shakes like a pinkie swear. 
VANESSA Vanessa. 
WADE What's a nice place like you doing in a girl like this? 
BUCK (O.S.) It ain't what she's doing, it's who. 
BUCK walks past and SLAPS Vanessa on the caboose. 
(CONTINUED) Deadpool    Final Shooting Script   11/16/15 13   CONTINUED: (2)                                                       13 
BUCK (CONT'D) I'd hit that shit. 
Wade pushes back his stool, stands menacingly. 
WADE Buck, you'd best apologize, before- 
But Vanessa doesn't wait for Wade's chivalry. She blows right by him and grabs a fistful of Buck's crotch. Buck gasps. 
WADE (CONT'D) Yeah, that. 
VANESSA (to Buck) Say the magic words, Fat Gandalf. 
BUCK I'm sorry! I have no filter between my brain and mouth. I'm working on it. 
Wade takes Vanessa's shoulders. 
WADE OK, he apologized... hakuna his tatas... 
Vanessa lets Buck go, turns on Wade. 
VANESSA (let's go) And you- (shakes Wade off) Hands off the merchandise. 
WADE Merchandise? So, what, you, uh, bump fuzzies for money? 
VANESSA Yup. 
WADE Rough childhood? 
VANESSA Rougher than yours.     Daddy left before I was born. 
WADE Daddy left before I was conceived.

VANESSA Ever had a cigarette put out on your skin? 
WADE I didn't know there was any other place to put one out. 
VANESSA I was molested. 
WADE Me too.     Uncle. 
VANESSA Uncles.     They took turns. 
WADE I watched my own birthday party from the keyhole of a locked closet, which was also my- 
VANESSA Bedroom?    Lucky. I slept in a dishwasher box. 
WADE So you had a dishwasher. I didn't know sleep. It was pretty much 24-7 of ball gags, brownie mix, and fun-house mirrors. 
VANESSA Who would do such a thing? 
WADE Hopefully you. Later tonight. (beat) And my Uncle Kevin. 
Wade EMPTIES the rest of Gavin's wallet: 
WADE (CONT'D) What can I get for two-hundred-seventy three bucks... and a Yogurtland rewards card? 
Vanessa shoves the bills into her halter: 
VANESSA About forty-eight minutes of whatever you want... (peers at card) And a low-fat dessert. 
DUCT TAPE fails to cover a big multi-fissured CRACK in the WINDOW of Wade's CRAPPY APARTMENT. Inside, WADE has VANESSA up against the wall decorated with CHRISTMAS LIGHTS that have overstayed their welcome and a CALENDAR. They are going at it like RABBITS. 
WADE (raises eyebrow) All year?

A MONTAGE of images: Fun, irreverent SEX around the CALENDAR between WADE and VANESSA, identified by various holidays. 
VALENTINE'S DAY SEX. WADE falls back onto a bed covered in rose petals with VANESSA on top of him. She has drawn a heart on his chest in red lipstick. They go at it hard... then pause for a romantic look and kiss. 
VANESSA Happy Valentine's Day... 
Then IMMEDIATELY go back to hard pounding. 
CUT TO: 
A medium shot of the top half of VANESSA. She is on hands and knees, rocking back and forth. WADE leans into frame from behind. 
WADE Happy Chinese New Year's... 
VANESSA (smiles) Year of the Dog. 
They go at it even harder. 
SMASH CUT TO: 
The same exact locked-off medium shot, only WADE is now on hands and knees. His expression betrays great stress. VANESSA leans into frame from behind. 
VANESSA (CONT'D) Relax... Happy International Women's Day... 
Wade girds himself, then lets out a surprised, WHIMPERY YELP as some pioneering object journeys into his virgin lands. 
CUT TO: 
WADE in bed, legs wrapped around VANESSA's neck, being orally pleasured.

WADE Happy Fourth of July! 
We see FIREWORKS through the skylight above. 
CUT TO: 
WADE sitting in an arm-chair, fully dressed, reading glasses on, purusing a book. VANESSA is reading in a chair opposite, also wearing reading glasses. 
VANESSA Happy Yom Kippur... (ALT:) Happy Cesar Chavez Day... (ALT:) Happy Lent... (ALT:) Happy Lyme Disease Awareness Day... (ALT:) Happy Wednesday... 
CUT TO: 
VANESSA in bed where Wade last was. Now her legs are wrapped around HIS neck, and he's pleasuring her. 
WADE (muffled) Happy Halloween... 
VANESSA Oo... ow... 
WADE (muffled) Sorry. (takes out Vampire teeth) Happy Halloween... 
Wade goes back to work.

WADE and VANESSA banging it out one last time, missionary style. 
VANESSA Happy Thanksgiving. (ALT:) Happy Wednesday.

Cut WIDE to reveal that they're on top of the KITCHEN TABLE during THANKSGIVING DINNER. Wine spills, cranberry sauce topples, mashed potatoes launch. ALT: BREAKFAST FOOD INSTEAD. 
Nothing takes away from the joy of the moment. 
18   INT.   WADE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - PAST                                18 
A CHRISTMAS WREATH hangs on Wade's wall. 
WADE (O.S.) If your left leg is Thanksgiving, and your right leg is Christmas... 
WADE strikes a pose, HANDS on HIPS, wearing an AWFUL, AWFUL CHRISTMAS SWEATER. And NO PANTS. 
VANESSA sits against the bed's HEADBOARD, SHEET pulled over her, up to her chin. She quickly lowers the sheet. Revealing an APPALLING CHRISTMAS SWEATER of her own. 
WADE (CONT'D) ...can I visit you between the holidays? 
Wade peels off his Christmas sweater... and STEPS CONFIDENTLY BACK TOWARD THE BED. But before he gets there... 
DEADPOOL (V.O.) ...to our regularly scheduled program. 
...HE PASSES OUT, FACE-PLANTING ONTO THE FLOOR. 
19   INT.   ONCOLOGY WARD - DAY - PAST                                      19 
WADE is sitting in a doctor's office, VANESSA by his side, opposite a solemn ONCOLOGIST. Every image suggests BAD NEWS: 
A COMPLEX looking MRI IMAGE of the CIRCULATORY SYSTEM on a BACKLIT VIEWING TABLE. SWEAT STAINS under Wade's arms. Vanessa GRIPPING his hand. The LOOK on the DOCTOR's FACE. 
WADE You're clowning.     You're not clowning?        I sense clowns. 
DOCTOR People react to news of late-stage cancer differently. 
Wade and Vanessa turn and share a devastated but loving look. 
VANESSA (to doctor, springs into action) So what do we do? Surely there's something... we can... do. I mean, my uncle, he was diagnosed with thyroid cancer, and there was this new experimental drug that-

The VOLUME of Vanessa's voice FADES until we can SEE her talking but no longer hear the words: 
DEADPOOL (V.O.) See, people do react differently. Vanessa's already working on Plan A. B. All the way to Z. Me? I'm memorizing the details of her face. Like it's the first time I'm seeing it. Or the last. 
DOCTOR (O.S.) Mr. Wilson? 
DEADPOOL (V.O.) Believe it or not, this is only the ninth shittiest thing that's ever happened to me. 
DOCTOR (O.S.) Mr. Wilson? 
DEADPOOL (V.O.) Stick around. Number 6 is coming right up. 
DOCTOR Take your time to process this. 
20   EXT.   FREEWAY - DAY                                                   20 
DEADPOOL HAS AJAX PINNED TO THE FREEWAY RAIL. 
DEADPOOL You know how many people I've killed to find you? 
AJAX Actually, I do. 
DEADPOOL So you're aware I've been waiting a long, long time for this. And now I'm finally gonna... (ALT:) So you're aware of the category 5 fuck- storm that's coming. (ALT:) Then you know what's coming. I'm about to do to you what Sugar Ray did to the mid-nineties. 
A massive SHADOW passes over AJAX and DEADPOOL, accompanied by LOUD METALLIC FOOTSTEPS. Ajax looks up, a bit awed.

Deadpool senses something, reaches back with one hand, feels... 
...what turns out to be Colossus's METALLIC CROTCH. 
DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Dad? 
COLOSSUS GRABS Deadpool's WRIST, CHUCKS him THROUGH the AIR, ASS OVER TEAKETTLE. 
21   INT.   WADE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - LATER - PAST                          21 
A CLOSE-UP of a Deadpool ACTION FIGURE from `X-Men Origins.' Mouth sewn shut. Blades implanted into wrists. 
In the exact same POSE we just saw the real Deadpool. Sitting in a nightstand DRAWER in Wade's apartment. 
WADE (O.S.) This is my most prized possession. 
Wade looks like he's reaching into the drawer for the action figure, but instead, reaches just UNDER it to grasp Wham!'s `Make it Big' album on Vinyl. He pulls out the album. 
VANESSA Wham? 
WADE Wham! (cradles album lovingly) `Make it Big' was the album George and Andy earned their exclamation point. 
Wade places the album carefully into one of two OPEN SUITCASES on the floor next to him. He is currently going through his possessions, TOSSING OUT the crap and placing the good stuff into the suitcases. 
Wade pulls out the action figure. 
WADE (CONT'D) But this. A little piece of me died the day this came out... 
Wade DUNKS the action figure in the trash can.         VANESSA stands opposite, arms crossed, FUMING. 
VANESSA So I'm s'posed to just... smile and wave you out the door? 
(CONTINUED) Deadpool   Final Shooting Script   11/16/15 21   CONTINUED:                                                             21 
WADE Think of it as a spring cleaning. Only if spring was death. (pulls out BERNADETTE PETERS CHANGE PURSE) If I had a nickel for every time I spanked it to Bernadette Peters. (opens purse, it's full of nickels) Looks like I do. 
Wade TOSSES the purse toward one of the suitcases.           Vanessa's hand stabs out and GRABS it. 
VANESSA Bernadette's not going anywhere. (slam-dunks purse back into drawer) `Cause you're not going anywhere. 
WADE (CONT'D) She sent away for all these colorful clinic brochures. I hear Chechnya's nice this time of... never. Then there's China... Central Mexico... Know how they say `Cancer' in Spanish? ¡El Cáncer.' 
Wade pulls out one last thing from his pockets: A POLAROID of HIMSELF and VANESSA. He stares. Weasel notices. 
WEASEL This belongs on the wall. I want to remember you when you looked... alive. 
Wade scrapes up a smile as Weasel tapes the picture to the BIG BAR MIRROR. Weasel pours a second wheatgrass shot. Clinks Wade's glass. They throw them back. WINCE. 
WEASEL (CONT'D) Almost forgot... 
Weasel slides Wade a distinctive black BUSINESS CARD across the bartop. 
WEASEL (CONT'D) Guy came in asking for you.     Real Grim Reaper type. 
Wade's gaze follows Weasel's gesture across the barroom, where an ominous MAN in a BLACK SUIT sits ALONE at a table. 
WEASEL (CONT'D) I don't know? May further the plot?

23A   INT.   SISTER'S MARGARET'S - NIGHT - PAST                             23A 
WADE dead-man-walks to the back of the bar. He passes BOOTHE and BEEF on his way. They nod solemnly, like cops at a funeral procession honoring one of their own. 
BEEF Wade. 
Beef offers Wade his shot. Wade eeks out a smile. Throws it back. Then continues on. Wade stops next to the MAN's TABLE. 
WADE Forget your scythe? 
The man, even creepier from close up, SMILES. 
RECRUITER Mr. Wilson. Have a seat. (Wade sits, long pause) I understand you've recently been diagnosed with terminal cancer. 
WADE Stalker alert. 
RECRUITER It's my job. Recruitment. And you have quite a reputation. I'm sorry you've had a tough go. But you're a fighter. And not just for Johnny Canuck, impressive as your stint in special forces was. Forty- one confirmed kills? 
WADE (bitter) One every seven weeks.     Same rate most folks get a hair-cut. 
Wade grabs the recruiter's drink and throws it back. 
WADE (CONT'D) To wash the taste out. It's hard to forget being so... impressive. 
RECRUITER Now you spend your days sticking up for the little man, slitting small time throats for small time folks. 
WADE People change. 
(CONTINUED) Deadpool   Final Shooting Script   11/16/15 23A   CONTINUED:                                                          23A 
The recruiter leans uncomfortably close. 
RECRUITER (low, conspiratorial) Speaking of which... Mr. Wilson, I represent an organization that may be able to help. What if I told you we can cure your cancer? And what's more, give you abilities most men only dream of? 
WADE I'd say you sound like an infomercial. And not a good infomercial, like Slap Chop. More Shake-Weighty. (jack-off motion) 
RECRUITER The world needs extraordinary men. We won't just make you better. We'll make you better than better. A super-hero. 
WADE I already tried the hero business. Let's just say it left a mark. The only chance you'll see me again is if I hit `fuck- it.' 
24    EXT./INT.    GUADALAJARAN CLINIC WAITING ROOM - DAY - PAST           24 
A DILAPIDATED, SKETCHY MEDICAL `CLINIC' haunts the cityscape in GUADALAJARA, MEXICO. 
WADE (V.O.) For now, I'll get through this with the one I love. 
A sickly-looking WADE is on the final stop in his futile quest to find a cure. DESPERATE. Among the MOST DESPERATE. 
He sits in a pathetic muzak-filled WAITING ROOM. Wearing a SOMBRERO and clutching VANESSA's hand. Her fingers are interlaced in his, once perfectly manicured nails chewed to the quick. 
Vanessa is also wearing a SOMBRERO, and ANXIETY on her face. 
Wade COUGHS SEVERELY, REPEATEDLY into a HANDKERCHIEF. 
Wade turns to the sweet ELDERLY COUPLE sitting next to him, ekes out a smile. The old man plays with some WORRY BEADS. 
(CONTINUED) Deadpool     Final Shooting Script   11/16/15 24   CONTINUED:                                                               24 
WADE (pulls out Spanish-English electronic translator) De donde eres? 
ELDERLY WOMAN Boca Raton. 
WADE Ah.   The fancy part of Mexico. 
ELDERLY MAN We've moved in with my son.       To afford the treatment. 
Wade looks pained to hear this. 
WADE Cancer?     Sorry - ¿El Cáncer? 
Delgado senses he is suddenly in danger, picks up a rusty SCALPEL from his tray. Wade moves toward him. Delgado LUNGES, He STABS WADE in the shoulder, then RUNS. 
Wade TACKLES him. In Wade's weakened state, the fight becomes an intense STRUGGLE. The two FALL and WRESTLE. The BUCKET of GIZZARDS overturns. They roll around in slop. 
The doctor squirms out of Wade's grasp and crawls into the hallway. Wade wriggles after him, tugging at his ankle. 
26   INT.   WAITING ROOM / HALLWAY - SUNSET - PAST                          26 
The MUZAC still plays. VANESSA smiles warmly/sadly at the little BOY, who is unwrapping his CHUPACHUP. 
Suddenly... a SCREAM and cries for help in Spanish. The NURSE and an ALARMED VANESSA rush toward the shouting. 
27   INT.   HALLWAY - SUNSET - PAST                                         27 
At last, WADE's fury has overcome his physical weakness. He straddles the DOCTOR's CHEST. His expression is that of a man who's LOSING his SHIT. 
Wade RAISES THE SCALPEL, SLASHES at the doctor's throat, then STABS him in the heart. The doctor writhes, spasms, gurgles, and falls still. 
Chest heaving, Wade raises his head to see... at the FAR END of the HALL: 
VANESSA - frozen, TERRIFIED. A blood-soaked Wade locks eyes with her and swims back up into SANITY... `What have I done?' This is a horrific glimpse into Wade's murderous past... 
...and the look on Vanessa's face is one of HORROR and PAIN. 
(CONTINUED) Deadpool   Final Shooting Script   11/16/15 27   CONTINUED:                                                             27 
Awash in shame, Wade staggers to his feet, slips on chicken blood, and LUNGES in the other direction. He hits the door at the end of the hall at a RUN. 
28   STAB!                                                                  28 
The sword, covered in BLOOD, penetrates the crayon drawing of the recruiter on DEADPOOL's CORKBOARD. 
DEADPOOL Thank you, Agent Smith. 
Deadpool lasers in on AJAX's picture at the top of the pyramid. 
29   EXT.    GUADALAJARA STREET - SUNSET - PAST                             29 
WADE leans against a wall, gasping for breath. He looks back toward her voice, face a mask of pain. Instead of seeking her... he melts into the busy street. 
30   EXT.    DEADPOOL'S LAIR - DAY                                          30 
DEADPOOL trudges to his FRONT DOOR.       He speaks to the AUDIENCE: 
DEADPOOL Some kind of anger can't be managed. Like the kind where your year-long plan ends with the wrong guy getting dismembered! That said... when it comes time to licking wounds... there's no place like home, and I share that home with someone you met, the old blind lady from the laundromat, Al. She's like Robin to my Batman. Except she's old. And black. And blind. 
POPS INSIDE 
DEADPOOL (V.O.) And I think she loves me. Wait... pretty sure Robin loves Batman, too. 
31   INT.    WORKSHOP - NIGHT - PAST                                        31 
WADE, ghastly, nearing death, lies BACK onto a STRETCHER, covered only by a FLIMSY HOSPITAL GOWN. He's being wheeled down a dim corridor by two tough-looking ORDERLIES. 
In one hand, he holds the recruiter's crumpled BUSINESS CARD. In the other, he clutches the limited edition VOLTRON RING, as tight as his shaky hand allows. 
(CONTINUED) Deadpool     Final Shooting Script   11/16/15 31   CONTINUED:                                                               31 
They turn a corner and push through a pair of double doors into a cavernous room. Wade looks around, full of hope for a new life. Immediately, every single thing he sees/hears begins to erode his confidence. The RECRUITER stands just inside the doors, smiling. 
RECRUITER (O.S.) Mr. Wilson! Nothing warms my heart like a change of someone else's. 
Walking into Wade's P.O.V. is the creepy RECRUITER.             He beams down on Wade. 
RECRUITER (CONT'D) You finally hit `fuck-it.' 
WADE Worse.  Just promise you'll do right by me. So I can do right by someone else. 
RECRUITER Of course. 
WADE Oh, and please don't make my super suit green. Or animated. 
RECRUITER I hope you enjoy your stay. 
The `Workshop,' as this old warehouse is affectionately called, has been converted into a working LABORATORY. 
Wade is wheeled through a vast room containing rows of individual `tents,' each containing a SUBJECT. Wade's eyes DART to helpless SILHOUETTES. 
We hear WHISPERS, WHIMPERS, MOANS. 
A FELLOW PATIENT, a pathetic, terrified little man named CUNNINGHAM, is wheeled past Wade, restrained on another STRETCHER. Cunningham briefly locks eyes with Wade, but quickly moves on by. 
Wade can't help but be alarmed by the TERROR in Cunningham's eyes. 
The tents are illuminated by BLINDING overhead lights.             Wade spies GRUESOMELY INTIMIDATING MEDICAL EQUIPMENT. 
Wade is wheeled into the tent that's his new home. The FIGURE who was pushing Wade DUMPS him onto a CHROME OPERATING TABLE and roughly STRAPS him down.

At last, Wade is laid back down on his table, only now in QUIET DARKNESS, MEEK, WITHOUT ANY RESISTANCE whatever. 
CUNNINGHAM (O.S.) Puppies. 
In the tent NEXT to Wade, CUNNINGHAM holds up his FIST to the fabric. Wade can see it through the cloth in SILHOUETTE. 
CUNNINGHAM (CONT'D) It helps picturing puppies. 
Wade gives Cunningham a KNUCKLE BUMP through the fabric. 
WADE Puppies. 
CUNNINGHAM Or kittens. If you swing that way. 
WADE (chuckles) I swing both ways. 
Wade swallows hard, grows serious: 
WADE (CONT'D) But me, I've been making a list of things I still plan to do. 
CUNNINGHAM A bucket list?

WADE I prefer fuck-it list: Naked tandem base- jumping with the WNBA's Sacramento Monarchs... Sparking up a spliff with the Olympic torch... 
CUNNINGHAM Finishing my Lego Millenium Falcon... 
WADE Giving Meredith Baxter Birney a dutch oven... 
CUNNINGHAM Making my kids banana pancakes... 
AJAX (O.S.) With the mouse ears? Creative, and delicious. 
AJAX and ANGEL DUST enter CUNNINGHAM's tent and begin prepping him for a fresh round of torture. 
AJAX (CONT'D) It's OK, I encourage distractions. Can't have you giving up on us, can we now, you little worm? 
Suddenly, a VOICE calls out from the adjacent tent: 
WADE (O.S.) Don't take that shit, Cunningham! How tough can he be? Name like Francis. 
Ajax is very subtly SURPRISED.      WHAT did Wade just say?       WADE is still strapped down inside.      Talking nice and LOUD: 
WADE (CONT'D) That's right! He got `Ajax' off a dish- washing liquid! (laughs from nearby tents) Legal name's Francis. F-R-A-N-C-I-oops. 
Ajax has ENTERED Wade's tent. Ajax's expression tells us all we need to know about the validity of Wade's claim. 
With as much freedom of motion as he has in one hand, Wade WAVES a STUB of PAPER at Francis. 
WADE (CONT'D) Dry-cleaning tag, Francis.     Snagged it off your lab coat. (beat) (MORE) 
WADE (broken, breathless) Yippee. 
DOCTOR But... the cells have inalterably changed. They're no longer destructive, but productive, selectively targeting and replacing damaged tissue. 
WADE That was a lot of... what's the word... syllables. Are you saying I'm better? 
DOCTOR Better than better.    A miracle. 
WADE (weak smile) My Mom used to call me that. (ALT:) Me and Jesus. (beat, to doctor) Thank you. I owe you my life. 
Wade grows choked up. The doctor is taken with empathy and affection. He tenderly brushes the hair off Wade's forehead, of which the camera catches the tiniest glimpse. Wade's skin is not RIGHT somehow. 
DOCTOR There. There. Your journey's been long and difficult. But you've become something extraordinary. Just rest now. Rest. 
The doctor slowly exits.     Wade lies there.    Actually relaxes. 
DEADPOOL (V.O.) Then, just when I thought I could breathe easy...

AJAX Oo. Someone lost his shot at homecoming king. 
WADE You f-fucking sadistic- 
AJAX No. Not fair. Everything I've done to you has been in your best interest. Even this next bit. You may be cured, but you still need to learn to be a better man. Polite. Respectful. What better way to teach you than to close this lid... and keep torturing you stupid. 
Ajax SLAMS the lid shut, LATCHES and LOCKS it. The hissing resumes. Wade's eyes grow wide. He starts to slip-slide toward absolute ANGUISH. 
DEADPOOL (V.O.) If you think I'm losing my marbles `cause I can't breathe. You're only half right. 
Ajax appears to be looking in at Wade. But we RACK FOCUS to reveal he's looking at his REFLECTION in the Plexiglas lid, checking for stuff between his teeth. 
DEADPOOL (V.O.) See, if Francis was able to see his reflection... 
The camera SWINGS around to Wade's POINT-OF-VIEW of Ajax through the glass lid, which has been newly ILLUMINATED by the surgical light above... 
...and then RACKS FOCUS to WADE's REFLECTED FACE. Covered with HORRIFIC SCARS. Wade is no longer a handsome young man. He is a monster. Which is perfectly visible to him one foot away. 
DEADPOOL (V.O.) You know what they say. You always remember your first time.

Back in the PRESENT, we find ourselves in a huge SCRAP-YARD, where various ships, planes, etc. are sold for scrap iron. 
Among various vehicles is an OLD, BATTERED COMBAT CARRIER, long given up for dead. 
A heavy truck navigates through the heaps of scrap-metal and grinds to a stop in front of the carrier. 
Two heavyset MEN climb down and head toward the back of the truck, heave the heavy door open. 
AJAX and ANGEL DUST stand just inside, boxes and gear piled up behind them. They hop down as four more rough-looking men pile out behind them. 
Angel Dust drags out a WOODEN CRATE. The planks crunch as she digs her fingers into the wood and heaves it up on one burly shoulder as if it weighed no more than a sack of flour. Heavy AMMO peeks through. 
ANGEL DUST Better to be the hunter than the hunted. 
Ajax and Angel Dust walk across the muddy yard toward a service elevator bolted to the rusting hulk of the carrier. 
AJAX Either I kill him, or he kills me.     Let's put him out of our misery...

Stained carpet, currently being swept by a roaming ROOMBA. IKEA... everywhere. 
The same old AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMAN we glimpsed early in the movie - late 70's - purple floral dress - sits on a ratty couch, where the typical old woman might KNIT. 
Instead, this old woman uses a BOX-CUTTER to lay waste to a BIG CARDBOARD BOX from IKEA - the `IVAR SHELVING UNIT.' 
BLIND AL Why such a douche this morning? 
DEADPOOL Let's recap. That cock-thistle who turned me into this freak... the one I've been waiting five years for... slipped through my arms today. Arm. 
Deadpool holds up his previously severed arm, which now has a little tweenage ARM emerging off it. Yes. Deadpool can GROW BACK LIMBS. 
DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Catching him was my only chance to be hot again. Get my super-sexy ex back. And stop the same shit from happening to anyone else. So yeah, things are pretty fucking scrumptious. 
Deadpool stands. Walks behind the couch, and as he passes the back of Blind Al's head... FARTS. 
DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Hash-tag Drive-by.

WADE You... sadistic... fuck! 
AJAX Where's the gratitude?! You're cured! Your mutated cells can heal anything. They're attacking the cancer as fast as it can form. Your insides are a war zone. Not to mention your outsides! 
Wade looks stunned as he struggles to process all this information. Ajax smiles down. 
AJAX (CONT'D) I've seen similar side-effects before.         I could cure them for you. But really, where's the fun in that? 
Wade says nothing, hating him but wanting to believe. 
AJAX (CONT'D) I'm going to close this lid again.     Maybe you no longer need it. But I do. 
For a long moment, Wade stares intensely at Ajax and sees... nothing, a black hole of empathy. And he knows this is a man who will never stop hurting him. 
***NOTE: We will not be reshooting the rest of the scene below with the exception of the final shot.**** 
So he turns his gaze to the ceiling and WITHDRAWS into himself... the one place the cruelty can no longer reach him. 
Angel Dust enters, chewing on her usual matchstick. 
AJAX He's all yours. 
Angel leans over the Punch-bowl, starts to undo Wade's restraints. 
ANGEL You smell like shit. 
When Angel Dust leans close to Wade's head he suddenly comes alive and uses the strength he has left to HEAD-BUTT her in the FOREHEAD. 
(CONTINUED) Deadpool   Final Shooting Script     11/16/15 CONTINUED: 
AJAX (impressed) Whoa. 
Angel advances toward Wade.      Ajax stops her. 
AJAX (CONT'D) Hey, hey, alright. It's alright. I think he earned that one, yeah? You take off. Go on... off you go. 
As Angel Dust EXITS the tent, she reaches to her mouth for her matchstick... only it's not there. She frowns, fishes another match from her pocket, and tucks it between her lips. 
Ajax finishes strapping Wade back down and goes to close the lid. 
AJAX (CONT'D) One question. What's my name? 
Wade remains listless, mouth SHUT.       BLINKS. 
AJAX (CONT'D) Didn't think so. 
Ajax CLOSES and LOCKS the lid.      HISS.    The oxygen DIALS FALL. 
DEADPOOL (V.O.) Sorry, Francis. But my lips are sealed. 
And then we're inside the punch bowl with Wade as the oxygen levels drop and the suffering rises. Through a fog of misery Wade sees Ajax staring down, watching him, drinking in his pain. 
41   INT.   WORKSHOP - NIGHT - PAST                                           41 
Back in the Punch-Bowl, Wade OPENS his MOUTH... within which he was HIDING a SINGLE MATCHSTICK, clenched carefully - dryly - between his teeth. 
He inhales... then SPITS OUT the match into his waiting PALM. Finally, he STRIKES it against the side of the Punch Bowl. 
Wade aims the now FLAMING match toward the tiny HOLE through which OXYGEN flows. The match is quickly burning down. Will it reach the hole before it snuffs out? 
At the last possible moment... 
BOOM.    STAB. 
QUESTIONS. 
BOOM!    STAB! 
INTERROGATION. 
BOOM!    STAB! 
DEADPOOL questions more and more thugs, each bit of information bringing him closer.... 
Soon there is a FOREST of knives sticking from the board. 
...and only the RECRUITER and AJAX are left. 
K44/VK44 INT.   RICE WORLD - NIGHT                                    K44/VK44 
A wretched room, dirty mattresses covering the floor. Dim light scatters through a tangle of IV bags hastily strung up over MEN too poor to have anywhere else to go and die. 
The RECRUITER kneels, speaking quietly to a particularly hardened patient. He places a card in the man's emaciated hand, then stands and walks toward a low doorway. 
The recruiter enters a brightly lit room stacked high with bags of rice. Two heavily armed THUGS fall in beside him. The men scan the aisles as they move toward a door leading out into an alley. 
DEADPOOL Agent Smith! 
They turn to see DEADPOOL, high atop a stack of rice bags. 
DEADPOOL (CONT'D) I know, right?! I look like a million bucks. (turns to camera) (MORE)

Without a word, the Recruiter flees, running through the big roll-up door. 
Deadpool leaps to land between the two bodyguards as they draw their weapons and spray the room with gunfire. 
One goes down in a bloody heap. Deadpool leaps toward the other, skewers him with both swords. The thug falls backward, dead before he hits the ground. 
L44/VL44 EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT                                           L44/VL44 
DEADPOOL Come out, come out, wherever you are! (darkens) Don't make me ask tw- (pleasantly surprised) Good for you! 
The Recruiter has stepped timidly from between overflowing garbage bins, hands raised, eager to talk his way out of this mess: 
RECRUITER To whom should I address my... desperate bargaining? 
DEADPOOL Don't recognize the voice? Maybe the resumé: Forty-one confirmed kills. Make that Eighty-nine. Seven the past week alone. Same rate most folks... (pulls out SWORD) ...get a shave. 
RECRUITER (realizes who it is, fights to stay composed) Mr... Wilson? 
DEADPOOL Ding-ding-ding! Now... you're about to tell me where I can find your boss. Or I'm gonna make you feel worse. Wait... 
Deadpool brings the sword closer to the recruiter's face. Turns to CAMERA: 
DEADPOOL (CONT'D) ...worse than worse. 
(CONTINUED) Deadpool   Final Shooting Script   11/16/15 L44/VL44 CONTINUED:                                                    L44/VL44 
RECRUITER And I pride myself on being persuasive. 
SMASH CUT TO: 
RS44   INT.   SISTER MARGARET'S - DAY - PAST                              RS44 
WADE stands in the shadows.      WEASEL sits at a table. 
WADE No... no way! I'm not making her life as ugly as mine! 
WEASEL C'mon, you can't look that bad! It's like that blemish no one notices but you. 
WADE Wrong. I'm a monster, inside and out. I belong in a circus, the kind that rolls around Eastern Europe in covered wagons. 
WEASEL I can't envision a scenario where Vanessa won't take you ba- (Wade steps into light, takes off his hoodie) -aaaaaccckkk!! Holy shit. You... are... terrifying. You look like an avocado had sex with an older avocado. 
Wade grabs the bottle of JACK DANIELS from the table, GUZZLES. 
WEASEL (CONT'D) We might have to move our relationship to text and phone only. 
Wade ignores Weas, slams down the bottle: 
WADE And the only guy who can fix this fugly mug, the asshole who ran that mutant factory, escaped to who knows where. 
WEASEL I take back the Vanessa thing.      You have only one option. 
WADE Find Francis-Go-Fuck-Himself.

WEASEL (not listening) Star in low budget horror movies. Seriously, you look like Freddy Krueger face-fucked a topographical map of Utah. 
Hypnotized, Deadpool puts one foot in front of the other, approaching the waitress. 
Suddenly, the WAITRESS TURNS to reveal her face:       VANESSA. 
Deadpool immediately CHICKENS OUT, puts his head down, turns away from her into the press of MEN around one of the stages. 
Vanessa catches the vaguest glimpse, but before she can get a better look, Deadpool is swallowed up by the crowd. 
She gets that warm shiver again... the one that says she's feeling an old presence. 
She stares after Deadpool.    It couldn't possibly be. 
Deadpool pushes past the men, almost in a panic, beating a HASTY RETREAT toward WEASEL at the back of the room.

DEADPOOL (V.O.) Shittiest moment numero tres. 
Deadpool walks past Weasel, fleeing into the men's room... 
53   INT.   MEN'S REST ROOM - CONTINUOUS                                    53 
...and SPLASH!     Washes his face at the SINK. 
DEADPOOL Lezzdothis. Before I re-reconsider. Maximum effort. 
A hand comes into frame offering a paper towel. It belongs to a WASHROOM ATTENDANT in a tuxedo vest. Deadpool uses the towel to wipe his face and finishes with the attendant's sleeve. 
DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Sorry. (tries to dry attendant's sleeve with paper towel) I get very uncomfortable around you guys. (takes mint off counter, then condom off counter, then sees tip jar) Crisp high five? 
54   INT.   `NO. 5 ORANGE' STRIP CLUB - NIGHT                               54 
VANESSA sets down a tray of empty glasses.        Her scum-bag of a MANAGER gives her a heads-up: 
MANAGER Someone out back asking for you. Said somethin' about an old boyfriend? 
55   EXT.   `NO. 5 ORANGE' STRIP CLUB - ALLEY - NIGHT                       55 
VANESSA exits the club into an ALLEY, one of Wade's old jackets thrown over her shoulders. One sickly street lamp casts some light. The rest is obscured in SHADOW. Vanessa spies the shape of a MAN hiding in the shadows. 
VANESSA I knew it was you. 
Vanessa is seized by memories.      She peers into the dark, heart pounding. 
VANESSA (CONT'D) With the weird, curvy edges. 
(CONTINUED) Deadpool   Final Shooting Script   11/16/15 55   CONTINUED:                                                             55 
Then steps forward slowly, nervously.        Overcome with emotion. 
VANESSA (CONT'D) (barely audible) Like a jigsaw puzzle. 
No one answers.     Vanessa gets a bad feeling and starts to back up. 
The man steps confidently into the light.        Not WADE... 
...but AJAX. Vanessa spins around and runs straight into Angel Dust, who step out of the shadows. 
Vanessa make a grab for her purse, contents spilling out onto the grimy street, but her hand comes up with a TASER. She jams it into the flesh of Angel Dusts shoulder. 
Angel Dust just smiles as electricity arcs and sizzles.           Then she grabs Vanessa's hand and twists it away. 
Vanessa THRASHES like a polecat. But Angel Dust is brutally strong. She clamps her hand around Vanessa's jaw and SQUEEZES, dangling her in the air by her FACE. 
AJAX You have Wade Wilson to thank for this. 
Vanessa's eyes widen in shock and surprise. 
AJAX (CONT'D) `The good Lord sends the fishing... 
Vanessa screams mutely into Angel Dust's palm. 
AJAX (CONT'D) ...but you must dig the bait.' 
56   INT.   `NO. 5 ORANGE' STRIP CLUB - HALLWAY - NIGHT                     56 
WADE pushes through the crowd to find WEASEL sitting in GYNO ROW at the edge of the stage. He's in the middle of slipping a bill into a dancer's garter. 
WEASEL Manager said she went that way. (thumbs towards the back) Good luck, Tiger! 
DEADPOOL moves quickly down a HALL, turns a corner, and REACHES for the knob of the door to the alley. His eyes WIDEN as he remembers something IMPORTANT. 
(CONTINUED) Deadpool   Final Shooting Script   11/16/15 56     CONTINUED:                                                             56 
Deadpool reaches back and pulls up his hood to hide his scarred FACE. 
Deadpool girds himself, then OPENS the door to spy... 
57     EXT. `NO. 5 ORANGE' STRIP CLUB - ALLEY - NIGHT                         57 
Colossus, now back on his feet, strides purposely forward. Bullets ping harmlessly off his metal skin. Angel Dust charges forward, snarling. 
DEADPOOL (shouts) Finish fucking her the fuck up. 
Colossus stops, annoyed. 
COLOSSUS Language.    Please. 
Then Angel Dust SMASHES into him. The two collide with earth- shaking force. The sheer power of Angel Dust's momentum slams them backwards into-and through-a huge pile of scrap. 
65   INT.   FLIGHT DECK - DAY                                              65 
AJAX pulls VANESSA forward to the edge of the carrier deck, forces her gaze downward toward the WAR ZONE below. 
AJAX How does it feel? Ex-boyfriend abandons you, becomes a sanity-challenged killer mutant in tights... 
VANESSA Says the sanity-challenged killer mutant in parachute pants. P.S. I've never played the role of damsel in distress. 
AJAX `Til now. 
Ajax yanks Vanessa away from the edge again. 
66   EXT. SCRAPYARD - CONTINUOUS                                           66 
Every MERC is pouring fire towards Deadpool's position. He hunkers down with NTW, her hands clamped tight over her ears. 
Deadpool unzips a zipper, reaches into his suit at the crotch, YANKS. Grimaces. We hear fabric tear. He pulls his hand out, waves a pair of torn TIGHTIE-WHITIES up from behind cover. 
(CONTINUED) Deadpool   Final Shooting Script     11/16/15 66   CONTINUED:                                                              66 
DEADPOOL Hey, fellas, whoa! Hold on!        Don'tcha wanna hear my terms?! 
The mercs spot the white `flag.' Fire slackens from full- auto to a few pot-shots. Finally, Deadpool pops up. 
DEADPOOL (CONT'D) You guys only work for that shit-spackled Muppet fart! So I'm gonna give y'all the chance to lay down your firearms in return for preferential - bordering on gentle - possibly even lover-like treatment. 
The Mercs ignore him, opening fire AGAIN with a vengeance. Deadpool ducks and drops his tightie-whities. 
DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Fine. Commando. (to NTW) Stay down, kid. Unless your power's stopping bullets. 
Deadpool SURGES forward, dives from cover, rolls.            He comes up boot knife out, arm whipping forward- 
The nearest merc's head snaps back as the knife buries itself to the hilt in his eye socket. 
Deadpool sprints forward, zig-zagging, leaping, spinning as he closes the distance to the mercs. He's moving too fast for their guns to track. Bullets chew up the ground behind. 
Deadpool reaches the first pile of twisted metal, slides under, comes up behind two mercs taking shelter there. The first man turns, gun barrel swinging `round. Deadpool ducks, sweeps his legs, grabs his gun as he goes down. 
Deadpool rolls over him, firing BACKWARD into the man's face while spinning up to smash his boot into the face of the second merc. He slides past, firing a burst backward into the merc's neck as he falls. 
Seconds later he's leaping OVER the heads of the next pair of mercs. They turn to fire up at him - too slow. He fires short, controlled bursts down into their upturned faces. BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! 
Deadpool lands, tosses the empty smoking gun.          Then slowly, lovingly, unsheathes his Katanas.

Deadpool is running forward now, weaving his way through the wreckage. Hunting. 
67   EXT.   SCRAPYARD - DAY                                                 67 
COLOSSUS and ANGEL DUST engage in a BATTLE ROYALE. Colossus grabs Angel Dust by the SCRUFF of her NECK and HURLS her into an ABANDONED AIRCRAFT. CRUNCH. 
Angel Dust is on one knee, shaken, disheveled, one BREAST hanging out of her torn flak jacket. 
The prim Colossus covers his eyes. 
COLOSSUS Uh... you seem to have, um... 
Angel Dust smiles, tucks the wayward boob back in, then BLASTS Colossus with a FLYING KNEE that generates SHOCK WAVES so powerful, Colossus' CHROME actually RIPPLES. 
Colossus growls and CHARGES AGAIN. 
CUT TO: 
DEADPOOL spins around a corner as another pair of MERCS move forward, guns raised. 
Deadpool dives under their fire, guts them in blurred flash of steel. THRUST! SLICE! IMPALE! COMPLETE MAYHEM. 
Another trio of mercs rush around the corner, opening fire as they see their comrades fall. DEADPOOL runs toward them, flips and dodges like a whirling dervish, bringing GUARDS down in surgical, artistic fashion, as if where he's killing them means as much to him as how. 
Two men converge    on Deadpool. He JUMPS. Mid-air, he flips his TWO KATANAS,    GRIPS them upside-down like ICE PICKS, and STABS down in an    arc to either side, SKEWERING two men through the TOPS    of their HELMETS. 
A final merc comes around the corner and Deadpool spins, slices the strap of his gun, kicks the man in the chest, knocking him flat on his back and sitting on his face. 
DEADPOOL Tea-bag! (notices man under him) Bob?! 
BOB Wade?!

Ajax squats down and picks up TWO STEEL-HAFTED FIRE-FIGHTING AXES, each with an ULTRA-SHARP BLADE on one side of its head and an EQUALLY SHARP CLAW on the other. 
Deadpool raises a KATANA and HURLS it NOT at Ajax, but the PUNCH-BOWL. The blade PENETRATES the PLEXI and tears into the RESTRAINT holding Vanessa's RIGHT WRIST, partly FRAYING it. AIR seeps through the CRACK. Vanessa catches a tiny BREATH. She TUGS on the frayed RESTRAINT. 
AJAX I hear you grow back parts. When I get done... parts will have to grow back you. 
DEADPOOL Good one.

A big BOOMING sound from below and then the deck of the carrier shakes as if from a mild earthquake. Ajax and Deadpool look at each other. Shrug. 
DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Let's dance. (beat) And by dance I mean try to kill each other. 
69   EXT.   SCRAPYARD - CONTINUOUS                                       69 
BAM!   Below, COLOSSUS delivers a HAYMAKER from hell itself. 
Angel Dust FALLS, then RISES, RIPS OFF the WING of a PLANE, and BLASTS Colossus with it... first like a BASEBALL BAT, then like a GOLF CLUB, then like a COUNTY FAIR MALLETS you use to try to ring a bell. CLANG! 
A battered NTW RACES toward Angel Dust. Angel Dust swings the wing, but NTW BASEBALL SLIDES UNDER it and EXPLODES up into her chin. 
Angel Dust is lifted off her feet into the side of the carrier, BUCKLING some of its supports. NTW rolls aside. 
70   EXT. FLIGHT DECK - CONTINUOUS                                       70 
And now, we get what we've been long been waiting for: 
THE FINAL CLOSE QUARTERS BATTLE between DEADPOOL AND AJAX. AXES vs. KATANA, TEN STORIES UP... 
AJAX TAKES a MIGHTY, ROARING SWING with an AXE. 
DEADPOOL Yowww! 
STEEL SINGS as AXE and KATANA meet again and again.        THRUSTS. PARRIES. SPARKS FLY! 
THUNK! Deadpool's BLADE passes through Ajax's THIGH and pins him to a piece of wreckage. 
CRACK!   Ajax tags Deadpool's head with the FLAT of an axe. 
SNAP! Ajax BREAKS the sword's blade with an AXE, not feeling anything as he slides his leg off the sword. 
GASP! VANESSA grits her teeth, pulls against the restraints. The thick nylon begins to tear as she saws it against the katana blade. 
(CONTINUED) Deadpool   Final Shooting Script   11/16/15 70   CONTINUED:                                                            70 
CLANG! AJAX wields both axes in a red blur of painted steel. Deadpool snatches up a piece of rusted RAILING from the deck, barely blocks Ajax's windmilling swings. 
Finally, Ajax smashes the length of rusty metal from Deadpool's hands with one axe, while the sharp CLAW END of the other buries itself in Deadpool's FOREARM. Deadpool hollers. 
Deadpool's red suit has torn away, and the SKULL of his TATTOO bleeds from a HOLE in its FOREHEAD. 
Deadpool GRITS his TEETH and YANKS the AXE from Ajax's grasp. A spinning KICK sends the second axe flying after the first. 
Now they're completely unarmed. 
AJAX Fine.   Fists. 
DEADPOOL Sounds like your last Saturday night. (smiles) The sense of humor survived. 
AJAX and DEADPOOL TRADE VICIOUS PUNCHES.        It's HAGLER vs. HEARNS! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! 
Inspired, VANESSA strains against the torn nylon. RRRRIPPP! Her right wrist TEARS FREE. She uses her freed hand to start unlatching her other restraints. 
DEADPOOL throws short, blinding PUNCHES - rat-a-tat-tat - into AJAX's jaw. 
DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Since you can't feel it? (holds up an INCISOR) I just knocked out your tooth. 
AJAX snarls, drives a SHOULDER into Deadpool, then MOUNTS him and BLUDGEONS his face with HAMMER-LIKE FISTS. 
DEADPOOL is starting to LOSE CONSCIOUSNESS when he turns his head to one side and spies the PUNCH-BOWL. 
We RACK FOCUS to VANESSA locking eyes with him from inside. Hers is an inspired... and INSPIRING look of LOVE. 
We hear a REPRISE of JOHN DENVER's `I WANT TO LIVE.'

VANESSA pushes against the sealed door of the punchbowl with all her might. With a squeal of metal the latch breaks, the twisted metal flying off the lid as it slams open. 
Vanessa grabs the KATANA, jerks it free with another mighty effort. Then slides down the containers toward AJAX. With a fierce scream, she PLUNGES the blade into his KIDNEY. The blade punches through the other side but Ajax feels no pain, YANKS out the katana, and THROWS Vanessa aside violently. 
But it's all the opportunity Deadpool needs. He SURGES with energy and throws an THUNDEROUS UPPERCUT, BLASTING Ajax off. 
JOHN DENVER I want to liiiiiive! 
71   EXT.   SCRAPYARD - DAY                                                 71 
Below: WHOOSH, BAM! Angel Dust ducks an exhausted Colossus's punch and KICKS him THROUGH another STEEL SUPPORT. Colossus COLLAPSES. The carrier GROANS. 
DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Me and you are headed to fix this face. Or else... 
Deadpool places a piece of paper onto Ajax's chest. 
Ajax shakes off the cobwebs and examines the paper; it's Deadpool's CRAYON DRAWING of Ajax getting his brains blown out. Ajax actually LAUGHS. 
AJAX Sorry. It's just. All this time, you bought that I have the cure? I'm flattered. But do I really look like the scientist type? You want the guy behind the guy. His name's Dr. Killebrew. And he's long gone. Who knows where. 
DEADPOOL Um.    What? 
AJAX You heard me. 
DEADPOOL You mean to say, after five long years, I've been chasing the wrong monkey? 
AJAX Sounds even stupider when you say it. 
DEADPOOL Like the kind of stupid who admits he can't do the one thing I'm keeping him alive for? (chambers a round) Any last words? Good. I got one: (pulls back the hammer) Francis. 
COLOSSUS (O.S.) Wade! 
Deadpool turns to see Colossus, hands on hips, looking extra HEROIC. NEGASONIC TEENAGE WARHEAD is STANDING at his SIDE. 
COLOSSUS (CONT'D) Four or five moments.

DEADPOOL I'm sorry? 
COLOSSUS Four or five moments.      That's all it takes... 
DEADPOOL To...? 
COLOSSUS Be a hero. Everyone thinks it's a full time job. Wake up a hero. Brush your teeth a hero. Go to work a hero. Not true. Over a lifetime, there are only four or five moments that really matter. Moments when you're offered a choice. To make a sacrifice. Conquer a flaw. Save a friend. Spare an enemy. 
Deadpool continues to hold the pistol to Ajax's head. 
COLOSSUS (CONT'D) In those moments, everything else falls away. The way the world sees us. The way we see oursel- 
BOOM!   OFF-SCREEN, A GUNSHOT. 
COLOSSUS (CONT'D) (dry-heaves again) Huuugglh! Why! 
REVERSE ANGLE to Deadpool, who's just shot AJAX in the head with Blind Al's SATURDAY NIGHT SPECIAL. 
DEADPOOL You were droning on! (shrugs) I may be stuck looking like pepperoni flatbread, but at least we've heard the last of him. If wearing super-hero tights means sparing psychopaths, maybe I wasn't meant to wear `em. Not everyone monitors a hall like you. 
COLOSSUS Just promise- 
DEADPOOL I'll be on the lookout for the next four moments. (MORE)

I'm just a boy... about to stand in front of a girl... and tell her- what the fuck am I gonna tell her?! 
CUT TO: Deadpool's P.O.V. BETWEEN Colossus and NTW of VANESSA, who's now walking quickly TOWARD him. She brushes between the two X-men and without saying a word, GRABS the fallen PISTOL and PUMPS TWO EXTRA BULLETS into Ajax's corpse. 
VANESSA (bang) Gratuitous. (bang) Worth it. 
DEADPOOL (to camera) Anyone else turned on? (to Vanessa) That's what I love about y- 
Vanessa promptly PUNCHES Deadpool in the face. 
DEADPOOL (CONT'D) I totally deserved that! (gets punched again) That too! (wards off knee) Maybe not the nethers. 
Vanessa restrains herself, then TURNS HER BACK, overcome. 
VANESSA Start talking. 
DEADPOOL I'm so sorry. For leaving. And taking so long to cowboy up. It's been a rough few years. 
VANESSA (snorts, dismissive) Rough? 
DEADPOOL I live in a crack house. With a family of twelve. At night, we spoon for warmth. Everyone fights for Noelle. She's the fattest. (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) Deadpool   Final Shooting Script   11/16/15 73   CONTINUED: (5)                                                     73 DEADPOOL (CONT'D) There's nothing we don't share.    Floor space. Dental floss. Condoms. 
VANESSA So you live in a house! (turns to face him) 
DEADPOOL I woulda found you before now. But the guy behind this mask isn't the same guy you remember. 
VANESSA You mean this mask? 
Deadpool FLINCHES but doesn't STOP Vanessa from slowly, gently taking OFF his mask, revealing underneath... HUGH JACKMAN's `SEXIEST MAN ALIVE' People MAGAZINE COVER. Blood at the pierce points. Mouth/eyes cut out to make a `mask.' 
DEADPOOL And this one. In case the other fell off. 
VANESSA You mean like this? 
Vanessa starts PULLING OUT staples. 
DEADPOOL Oo. Ah.    Quicker - like a Bandaid!    Owww- di 5000.

Tyler takes out a cigarette. Lights it. Without saying a word his mother takes it and snubs it out in an empty water glass. 
DIANE (to Caroline) Did you tell Tyler what your art teacher said about your portrait? 
Caroline, as bemused as an eleven year old can be, looks at her mother, then at her brother. She adopts a very motherly tone. 
CAROLINE Tyler, did I tell you what my art teacher said about my portrait? 
TYLER Why no, Caroline. What did your art teacher say about your portrait? 
DIANE (smiling) You two. I quit. 
She flickers a glance at her ex husband and squeezes Les' hand. 
CAROLINE ...She was very impressed. She said I captured a moment like a young James Whistler. 
The WAITRESS brings platefuls of extravagant cheesecake to the table. Les dives in. Charles is having toast. He sips a glass of water and takes a surreptitious glance at his Patek Phillippe. 
TYLER Young Whistler... good... 'cause Whistler really fell off late in his career. He's the Michael Jackson of European art history. 
DIANE She suggested your sister take Pratt's Summer Art Intensive and that's hugely prestigious. 
Caroline looks a bit sheepish, Tyler high fives Caroline. 
Diane, again, flickers a glance at Charles. 
CAROLINE I would be the youngest one, ever, practically... 
CHARLES Tyler, would you please pass the butter? 
Beat. 
DIANE Caroline was speaking. 
TYLER (to Charles) Are you really this clueless? Are you really dismissing her like this? 
Diane touches Caroline's hair. 
CHARLES Caroline is perfectly capable of speaking up if she is feeling dismissed. Caroline, are you feeling dismissed? 
CAROLINE I'm okay. 
CHARLES (solicitous, to Caroline) I didn't mean to change the subject. 
TYLER What was the subject? 
CHARLES Excuse me? 
TYLER The subject we were discussing. What was it? 
Beat. 
CHARLES Now's not the time for your heroics Tyler 
TYLER No. It's the perfect time. 
Charles makes a minute adjustment to his collar. 
Father and son lock eyes until... 
TYLER (whispering, to Caroline) Do you need me to take you anywhere? 
Caroline shakes her head. 
CAROLINE I'll stay with mom. 
Diane glares at her ex-husband. 
Tyler rises and kisses his sister's forehead. 
TYLER Then I'll see you after school. 
CAROLINE Kay. 
He exits as Caroline sips her lemonade, avoiding everybody's eyes. 
6   INT. SUBWAY CAR -- JUST AFTER                                 6 
Tyler standing although there are a few seats available. The car window strobes behind him. He takes off his jacket and button down and ties them both around his waist. 
7   INT. WALL STREET COFFEE SHOP -- AFTER                             7 
Tyler in his pants and white tee shirt looks completely out of place amidst all the business types. 
He sits in the last booth facing the street. His tattered JOURNAL lies open in front of him, a BINDER CLIP holds his page as he works quietly crafting an entry. 
MUSICIAN #1 glares, but gives no further response, he just wants to get across the street. The Neanderthal revs and lurches again. 
MUSICIAN #2 slams his hand on the hood of the car. 
MUSICIAN#2 What's your problem? 
NEANDERTHAL DRIVER My problem? Keep your hands off my car, asshole. 
MUSICIAN#2 Blow it out your ass, Guido. 
MUSICIAN#1 Go back to Long Island. 
The car's four doors open, and the Neanderthals lope to the front of the car. The driver is holding a mini baseball bat at his side. 
NEANDERTHAL DRIVER I'm from Queens, faggot 
A Neanderthal shoves one of the musicians, and the driver starts wailing on the other with the bat. Tyler watches as the Neanderthals overpower them. The altercation has turned into a full on assault. The Musicians are getting stomped into the pavement. 
TYLER'S GIRL So we were thinking we could go... 
Tyler walks right past the girl without even looking at her. 
AIDAN (under his breath) God damn it. 
Aidan runs off after Tyler. 
Tyler jumps fully into the thick of it, swinging, grabbing the beefiest Neanderthal in a choke hold and pounding the guy's face. He fights like a pit bull. Not feeling, not stopping. 
Aidan gets punched in the face. Tyler elbows the nose of the guy who punched Aidan and it spurts blood. Then someone hits Tyler in the gut, and he doubles over and takes a knee to the chin. The musicians get back to their feet and fight back. It's a brawl. 
Aidan's girl is screaming for the cops. Tyler's girl, following the instincts of the inebriated, has teetered near enough to the brawl to imperil herself. 
A Neanderthal swings at Aidan and misses, grazing the girl. She jerks away in her high heels and crashes to the pavement, splitting her lip on impact. Tyler head butts the guy. 
16   EXT. SIDE STREET -- LATER                                   16 
An AMBULANCE and TWO E.M.T.'S are on site. 
THE COMBATANTS from the brawl are lined up on the curb. 
SERGEANT JAMES CRAIG, a little older and heavier than when we first met him at the train station, is standing with the Girl, who is a mess. Her nose bloody, her dress torn. 
Craig shields the Girl with his body, listening carefully to her and her friend as the two girls GESTURE ANGRILY at the Neanderthals. Craig's eyes flicker in the same direction. 
Craig's PARTNER, LEO, AFRICAN AMERICAN, a few years younger, is on the radio to Dispatch. 
Craig snaps his fingers at one of the E.M.T.'s and receives a blanket, which he carefully wraps around the girl. Then, to his partner, indicating Tyler and Aidan... 
CRAIG Cut those two loose. 
Leo puts down the handset and uncuffs the guys. 
LEO (quiet) Take a walk. 
Tyler takes a beat, looking at the lineup. Aidan, rubbing his wrists, gestures "Let's go". Tyler looks at the bloodied Girl and... 
Craig, going through the pockets of Neanderthal #1. 
CRAIG Anything in here that's going to stab me, Einstein? 
Craig finds a packet, or a vial. 
CRAIG Nice. You like to get high and hit women? 
Aidan gives Tyler's elbow a gentle tug. Tyler's caught up in the action. 
NEANDERTHAL#1 I don't even know the bitch. 
Rage flickers across Craig's face. 
Craig moves down the line to one of the musicians, going through their pockets. 
CRAIG How about you two? 
Tyler, compelled, drawing closer to the action. 
MUSICIAN#1 It wasn't us, man! 
NEANDERTHAL#1 That cocksucker kicked my car! 
CRAIG Shut up, genius. 
MUSICIAN#1 (to Neanderthal) Eat shit, pencil dick. 
CRAIG Alright. That's it. Everybody goes downtown. 
ESCORTING OFFICER Roth, Brewer. 
Tyler glares at Aidan. 
AIDAN Yeah, I called your dad's office. Sue me. 
18   INT. FAR ROCKAWAY - CRAIG FAMILY HOME - KITCHEN -- MORNING   18 
Ally, with a cup of coffee, is on the house phone. 
ALLY So when would that be available?...No, that's sooner than I'd thought. And is there any kind of deposit?.. Okay. 
Craig comes in through the kitchen door, takes off his jacket and starts washing his hands at the sink. 
ALLY I'll call you back. Thanks. 
Ally hangs up. Makes a quick appraisal of her dad. He has a little blood on his cuff. He splashes his face with water. 
On automatic pilot, Ally flips on the toaster, pours some hot coffee into a Sesame Street Mug, pours in a measured dose of brown sugar from the dispenser, then flips open a bottle of Aspirin and deposits two of the tablets into the mug. 
She packs up her back pack with school stuff as Craig gulps his coffee. 
ALLY What did you tell me you were going to do when things got tight? 
The toaster dings. She extracts an English muffin and squeezes honey from a bottle shaped like a bear. 
CRAIG Breathe. 
ALLY Did you? 
CRAIG I did. I'm breathing right now. Who was that? 
ALLY The lady from student housing. We talked about it. Remember? 
Beat. 
CRAIG Sure. 
Ally grabs her sweatshirt. 
ALLY Mrs. Lippman is going to drive me. 
CRAIG I'll drive you. 
She flounces out the door, holding her own cup of coffee and the English Muffin. Craig dries his hands, grabs his jacket and a set of keys from the counter. 
19   EXT. DRIVEWAY.                                               19 
Outside their red-brick row house at the end of a block of red-brick row houses. 
Ally has her mug on the roof of the car and is searching through her bag. 
Craig comes around the driver's side and slides Ally her keys across the roof. She drops them in her bag. 
ALLY Mrs. Lippman said she'd do it. 
Craig is in the driver's seat, waiting. Ally grabs her coffee mug and gets into the passenger seat. She hands him his English muffin, which he holds in his mouth as he starts the car. 
She flips down the visor and checks her very light eye makeup. 
ALLY You're exhausted. When you have a stroke I'm going to abandon you on a park bench. 
They start to back out. 
ALLY This drive is too long. 
20   INT. EXECUTIVE FLOOR -- RECEPTION -- DAY                     20 
Tyler and his messed up face on his feet in the waiting area. English Club chairs, green baize on the walls. A RECEPTIONIST types away across the room. Tyler takes out a cigarette. Lights it. Draws the ire of... 
THE RECEPTIONIST You know you can't smoke in here. 
Tyler looks down at a heavy crystal ash tray on the coffee table in front of him. It's clearly never been used. 
TYLER So what's with the ash tray? 
THE RECEPTIONIST It completes the room. 
Tyler takes a long drag, grinding out the ember on the pristine surface. He smiles a charming smile at the aggravated woman. 
TYLER Tease. 
JANINE O/S Tyler... 
JANINE, Charles' long time assistant, late forties, kind eyes, watches Tyler from the hallway. 
TYLER This was my favorite book ever. Michael had it and he hit me over the head with it until I read it. Its about all these God and Goddesses who spend all of their time being jealous and petty and otherwise acting like human beings. The illustrations are amazing. 
Caroline opens the book carefully and has a peek. She smiles. 
CAROLINE Ooh. These are cool. Thanks! Where are we meeting mom? 
TYLER Guggenheim. What's up with those girls? 
CAROLINE I just...they think I'm weird. Sometimes I sort of space out. 
TYLER When you're drawing? 
CAROLINE Yeah. Other times too. Madamoiselle Fleischman had to snap her fingers at me a lot today. And everybody laughed and they all think I'm a freak of nature. 
Caroline takes a brief glance over her shoulder, towards the school. 
TYLER Je m'appelle "Freak of Nature." 
Caroline smirks. 
TYLER Mon dieu, mon soeurette! Je m'appelle "Freak of Nature". Sacre Bleu. French Toast. 
CAROLINE What are you going to tell mom about your face? 
TYLER I finally found something I'm good at? 
26   EXT. NYU -- FRONT STEPS BELOW THE FLAGS -- DAY            26 
Aidan appears to have cornered a PROFESSOR on her way in or out of the building. The woman looks tired, annoyed, like she just wants to go. Aidan talks fast, even faster than usual. 
AIDAN ...I know by every numerical measurement I didn't pass but what I was hoping was that maybe you give me a grade on my trying to pass. My commitment to effort. My commitment to commitment...Since the semester is nearly at it's terminus. 
Craig's car rolls to a stop just in front of the flags. Ally gives him a kiss on the cheek. She gets out, and walks up the stairs, right past Aidan. 
AIDAN (distracted) I mean... uh... life's only about what we put into it. It's about people. And what they put into it. And I'm -- ah, screw it. 
Aidan runs off leaving the befuddled professor on the steps. 
27   INT. RAILROAD FLAT-- LIVING ROOM -- DAY                   27 
Tyler, again with the guitar. Aidan enters, excited. 
AIDAN He's got a daughter. 
TYLER Who? 
AIDAN The cop... The cop who busted your face all up. He's got a daughter. And she's hot! I smell revenge! 
TYLER Revenge. What do you want me to do, kidnap her? 
AIDAN You introduce yourself...go on a few dates...be your charming, gentlemanly self... And then, flip the script. 
TYLER What does that mean? 
AIDAN Screw her brains out and make her call you daddy. Steal her underwear and sell it on ebay. Put her in Clown Shoes, take lewd photos and post them on her high school's home page. I don't know. Be creative. 
TYLER You should be incarcerated on general principle. 
AIDAN Hey. What happened to you was very emasculating. Tell me you don't want to get that asshole and I'll drop it. 
TYLER I don't want to get that asshole. 
AIDAN Just meet her. 
TYLER I don't want to meet her. 
AIDAN She's cute. 
TYLER I don't care. 
AIDAN You're meeting her. 
TYLER I'm not meeting her. 
28   INT. COFFEE SHOP. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK.- DAY            28 
A Student Hangout. The place is bustling. Numerous NYU STUDENTS move, sit, eat, lounge. Aidan scans the crowd. Tyler stands beside him looking far less enthusiastic. 
TYLER This is one of those moments I'm already regretting. 
AIDAN She was here yesterday. 
TYLER What am I supposed to say to this girl? "Hey doll face, your dad trampled all over my civil liberties, wanna make out?" 
AIDAN Well don't call her doll face. 
Caroline notices her teacher staring. She doesn't like it and shifts to block her view. The teacher gently eases her back. Smiles softly. 
Caroline smiles back as her teacher moves across the room. Caroline has just put her pencil back to paper when... 
The BITCHY GIRLS we've seen before start whispering and smirking. One of them mouths... 
CHUBBY GIRL Kiss ass freak. 
Caroline's smile shrinks away and she goes back to work. 
30   INT. CRAIG FAMILY HOME ALLY'S BEDROOM-- NEXT EVENING         30 
Ally in sweat pants, an ancient tee-shirt, her hair in a Scrunchie, eating Mallomars from the bag and reading. 
Craig yells from the bottom of the stairs. He carries a bag from a video store. 
CRAIG Don't be mad... 
ALLY Dad, we've seen freaking Erin Brockovich twice already. You always cry. 
CRAIG O/S I do not. 
ALLY It's embarrassing. 
Her cell phone rings. 
ALLY Hello? 
31   EXT. FIRE ESCAPE. RAILROAD FLAT.                            31 
TYLER Hey. It's Tyler. 
INTERCUT: 
Ally winces. 
ALLY Hi. 
TYLER You're going to stand me up. I can feel it in my bones. I'll be devastated. 
ALLY No... I...I was just... 
TYLER You were just sitting around in your pajamas watching T.V. 
ALLY No. I'm not watching T.V. I'm just...getting dressed. 
She wipes her hands on her sweats, smearing them with chocolate. 
ALLY And I'm going to meet you at the place at..what time again? 
TYLER Eight. 
ALLY Right...yes. Eight...okay. 
She hangs up. 
ALLY Shit. 
She whips the Scrunchie out of her hair and heads for the bathroom. 
32   INT.CRAIG HOUSE. KITCHEN.                                   32 
Ally comes down the stairs, putting on her earrings. 
Craig looks at Ally, confused. 
ALLY I'm going out. 
CRAIG I can see that. 
ALLY Well, you're a trained investigator. 
She is moving quickly, grabbing her bag, her wallet. Craig tosses her keys. 
CRAIG Who are you going with? 
ALLY A boy from school. 
Beat. 
CRAIG Okay. 
ALLY I wasn't asking for permission. 
CRAIG (sharply) I know. (more gently) Have a good time. Here's cab fare. 
Ally carries a GIANT PANDA under her arm. Tyler walking beside her with a self-satisfied smile. 
ALLY I don't know what you're smiling about. 
TYLER I won. 
ALLY Paying off the attendant is not winning... It's cheating. 
TYLER I just paid a premium to cut out the middle man. That's innovation. That's free market enterprising. That's what made America great. 
ALLY Aha. By the way, what happened to your eye? 
Tyler touches the bandage. 
TYLER Oh, it's nothing, just a bar fight. 
ALLY How butch. 
TYLER I know. I'm practically a pirate. 
ALLY Okay, Captain Morgan... 
TYLER (laughing) You've got some serious timing. 
ALL It's getting late. 
TYLER I'll walk you to the train. 
ALLY I'll take a cab. 
37   EXT. SIDEWALK -- JUST AFTER                               37 
Tyler is just hailing her a taxi. He stands there holding the door open. 
ALLY Thanks. 
Beat. 
Tyler leans in to kiss her. Ally turns away. 
ALLY Not tonight. Not never... just... not tonight. 
CAB DRIVER We goin' or what? 
ALLY Hey! Turn on the meter. 
Tyler respectfully leans back. 
TYLER So dessert before dinner for fear of death by rogue asteroid... yes. Kissing guy you're obviously attracted to before driving off into the unknown New York night... no. 
Ally considers. 
She gives him a quick but tender kiss. 
ALLY You're really weird. 
She gets in the cab. 
ALLY (to the driver) I'm going to Queens and I don't wanna hear about it. 
Off she goes in the taxi. Tyler watches her go. 
38   EXT. PRIVATE SCHOOL. THE LAST DAY OF SCHOOL.               38 
Caroline exiting with the crowd. One of the Bitchy girls shoulder checks her from behind as she passes. Tyler, waiting on his perch, catches it, walks up to her. 
TYLER Happy end of sixth grade! 
CAROLINE Finally. 
39   EXT. CENTRAL PARK -- ALICE IN WONDERLAND STATUE -- AFTERNOON39 
CHILDREN climbing all over the bronze statue. Caroline among them. She sits on a mushroom cap, letting her legs dangle. Tyler watches her from their usual bench, his bike leaning next to him. 
CAROLINE They have me in this art program summer thing at Pratt... 
TYLER I heard. 
CAROLINE It's very prestigious due to my artistic greatness. 
TYLER Don't pretend. I know you're proud. You should be. 
Caroline allows herself a tiny grin. 
CAROLINE There's, like, a thing... 
TYLER I don't actually get grades. 
Beat. 
TYLER I'm not technically enrolled. I worked out an auditing thing. 
ALLY Oh. And The Strand is not a significant career choice. 
TYLER I like the books. 
He indicates the dishes. 
TYLER You don't have to help me, you know. 
ALLY At the rate you're going, dish washing is going to be your life's vocation. I can say I knew you when. 
He flicks a bit of water on her shirt. Ally takes a beat. 
ALLY This is the playful, you get me all wet part? Right? 
TYLER (horsing around) You make it sound so cheap. 
Ally's not having it. 
ALLY It is cheap. I've seen this scene a hundred times. 
Tyler's a little confused. 
TYLER I'm sorry. I didn't... 
ALLY You know what never happens in this scene, Tyler-who-doesn't-really-go- to-school? Tyler-who-doesn't-really care-about-his-job? 
Tyler blinks helplessly. 
ALLY This. 
An entire enormous pot of pasta water up ended on the host. Bits of spaghetti cling to him, tiny tomatoes and zucchini on his shoulders like little barnacles. He sputters and gasps and blinks. 
ALLY No, that usually never happens. 
She calmly goes back to washing dishes. 
Beat. 
Spaghetti guy stares at her. 
She gives it right back to him, 100% New York City. 
Beat. 
In one move Tyler slings Ally over his shoulder. She grunts, unglamorously. 
42   INT. BATHROOM -- SECONDS LATER                               42 
Tyler bursts through the bathroom door. Ally over his shoulder. Never one to waste a moment, she uses the opportunity to check out what's in his wallet. He turns on the shower. She has his drivers licence. 
TYLER Apologize. 
ALLY Never. Your middle name is Keats? Your parents are pretentious as hell. 
Tyler turns on the shower and tosses Ally into the water. She dances to avoid the stream. Ally grabs the portable shower head and turns it at him. 
Tyler jumps into the tub to avoid the spray. They wrestle for the shower head. 
TYLER Apologize. 
ALLY I'd rather eat monkeys. 
This cracks Tyler up. He stops struggling for the shower and gasps a little with laughter, putting up his hands in surrender. Ally stands there, holding the shower head, giggling. 
They lock eyes for a moment. The air is charged. 
Ally spritzes him in the face. 
TYLER I surrender! Oh my God, you're relentless. 
He slides down the wall until he's sitting in the tub, Ally follows. 
ALLY Victory at all costs. 
43   INT. BATH TUB -- LATER                                       43 
Tyler and Ally lie side-by-side, drenched. Their feet hang over the edge of the tub. Tyler reaches into his pocket and removes a dripping cigarette packet. He squeezes out water. 
TYLER Now... I'm furious. 
AIDAN I'm sorry. 
ALLY Tyler... 
Tyler kneels down. Ally pushes her purse at him, she looks like she's about to pass out. 
ALLY I, need, you... to call... my dad. 
Tyler and Aidan share a look. Aidan shrugs. 
TYLER Oh. OK. Sure. 
Tyler pulls out her cellphone - the battery is dead. 
TYLER Your phone's dead. Just tell me the number and I'll call him... 
Tyler turns around to find Ally passed out on the floor. He tries to gently nudge her awake. 
TYLER Ally? Ally? 
SERGEANT CRAIG (O.S.) I know Ally's a good kid, Leo. 
45   INT. CRAIG FAMILY HOME -- ALLY'S BEDROOM -- LATE NIGHT       45 
The bedside clock reads 3:47. Craig is on the phone while searching through Ally's desk drawers. For anything. He finds a note book with a red cover and starts flipping through it. 
CRAIG ...She was supposed to be back. She's not back ... call Ted Proferes ... and what's his face in the 9th...and call me back. Just do it, Leo! 
Craig hangs up the phone. 
Beat. 
He picks it up again and starts dialing, still flipping through the notebook. 
46   INT TYLER'S BEDROOM -- NEXT MORNING                          46 
Ally wakes up alone in Tyler's bed, hung over, confused, trying to put the pieces together, then she sees the clock. And a wave of panic washes over her as she jumps out of bed. 
ALLY ...oh God oh God oh God oh God... 
47   INT. LIVING ROOM -- LATER                                    47 
Tyler sleeps on the couch using Aidan's Irish Flag as a blanket. Ally comes in pulling on her shoes. Tyler stirs in time to see her run out the door. 
48   INT. CRAIG FAMILY HOME -- LATER                              48 
Craig sits at the table, dialing someone, anyone. Ally enters, drops her keys on the counter. Her father doesn't look at her as she pours herself a coffee. 
ALLY ...I'm sorry. I fell asleep... 
Craig squeezes honey into his coffee, practically strangling the Bear. Not looking at her. 
Ally notices the red notebook on the kitchen table next to the phone. 
CRAIG You turned your phone off. 
ALLY I forgot to charge it. 
It dawns on her... 
ALLY That's mine. From my desk. 
Craig says nothing. Just stirs his coffee. Ally is furious. 
ALLY How could you? 
CRAIG You were gone all night. I was trying to get some information. 
ALLY How could you go through my stuff like I'm a suspect? 
CRAIG Then stop acting like one. 
ALLY What is the matter with you, Dad? You have no respect for me and the way I'm feeling, my privacy. We talked about this! You're totally paranoid... 
CRAIG You watch your mouth! 
ALLY You don't do anything. You don't go anywhere except work. You have no life. 
CRAIG My life is right here! In this house. The same place as yours. But you're spitting all over it. 
ALLY Jesus Christ, Dad! I went on a date! 
CRAIG I smell alcohol... 
Right back at him. 
59   INT. RAILROAD FLAT -- LIVING ROOM -- DAY                  59 
Aidan sits in the living room, trying to assemble an IKEA television stand. A joint smolders in the ashtray. The BUZZER rings. 
Aidan goes to answer it. 
AIDAN Hello? 
DIANE Aidan, it's Diane. 
He blinks. 
AIDAN Oh, hey Diane. 
He throws down the keys, then yells towards the roof... 
AIDAN T! It's your mom. 
With Diane's knock the door swings open. 
AIDAN Hey Diane. 
He gives her a kiss on the cheek. 
DIANE You really have to fix that door. I'm so sorry to just show up. I called but your phone was busy. 
Aidan looks and realizes that the phone is indeed off the hook, as just the handset, wrapped in duct tape, is visible on top of the sofa. 
AIDAN No problem. Come on in. 
Tyler and Ally enter the apartment through the fire escape 
TYLER Hey mom. 
DIANE Hey. I'm so sorry honey. I tried to call but... 
TYLER. It's okay. Mom, this is Ally. Ally, this is my mom, Diane. 
ALLY Hi. Nice to meet you. 
Diane is thrilled. She has a huge mom grin. 
DIANE Ally. It's lovely to met you. Just lovely. 
Diane is pumping Ally's hand like she's drilling for oil. 
TYLER Sit down, Mom. Can I get you something? 
She navigates the IKEA carnage and sits on the sofa, the joint smoldering in the ashtray in front of her. Aidan ever the gent, removes the ashtray to the window ledge. 
DIANE Yes. Aidan, would you bring back that spliff, please? 
Beat. 
AIDAN Uh..okay. 
Tyler looks completely befuddled. Aidan passes Diane the joint. She takes a deep hit. 
DIANE Thank you. 
AIDAN How's work, Diane? 
DIANE Well ... (BIG exhale) I just found housing for a family that had been in shelters for three weeks. So that's good. On the other hand, I have six other families. 
The women measure each other. 
DIANE But Tyler, I wanted to talk to you. 
ALLY Come on, Aidan. 
AIDAN What? 
ALLY Nice to meet you, Diane. 
She starts to drag Aidan out the window, back up the fire escape, but he makes a brief detour. 
AIDAN Don't freaking bogart that joint, Diane. 
DIANE Sorry. 
She hands it back to him and Aidan and Ally climb away. Tyler sits next to his mom and lights a cigarette. 
DIANE Well, first, your sister is all excited about your birthday at the house. I wish you'd told me. 
TYLER I wish she'd told me. It was a unilateral Caroline decision. Will you make sausage and peppers? 
TYLER Caroline's show. 
CHARLES O/S What about it? 
TYLER (ready to kill him) You are coming, right? 
CHARLES O/S Fine. Yes. I'm coming. We'll go to dinner first. Alright?... (to Janine) Janine? 
TYLER Dinner? That's not... 
CHARLES I'll make a reservation and have Janine call you. 
He hangs up. Tyler stares at the phone a sec, then hits his head, once, against the bathroom door. 
64   INT. DIANE'S HOUSE -- DINING ROOM -- NIGHT -- A WEEK LATER   64 
Tyler is sitting at the table in the darkened room with Ally standing behind him with her hands over his eyes. 
Caroline enters from the kitchen carrying Tyler's BIRTHDAY CAKE. She has obviously decorated it herself. She has drawn (as best as she could, given the medium) the characters from the ALICE statue in frosting. 
It reads "A VERY MERRY UNBIRTHDAY TO YOU", and has "22" in numerical candles and "+ 1 TO UNGROW ON" written next to that. 
She's singing. Aidan, Ally, Diane are all singing. 
There's a flash from a camera off screen. It's Les. 
Caroline puts the cake down in front of her brother and Ally takes her hands away just as they finish the song. 
Tyler's face in the candlelight as he sees Caroline's efforts. He takes a huge breath... 
CAROLINE Make a wish. 
He looks at her and blows out the candles. Everybody applauds, Diane longer than anyone else. Her eyes are shining. 
CUT TO: 
65   INT. DINING ROOM --LATER                                       65 
The cake totally devoured. Les is obsessively eating frosting. 
Caroline is trying to teach Aidan how to waltz in the living room. He is... 
CAROLINE Retarded. Tyler? 
Tyler rises from the sofa and takes over as Caroline's partner. She puts her feet on top of his feet and they waltz. 
TYLER/CAROLINE "One, two. three. One, two, three" 
Ally and Diane are washing dishes in silence. 
Beat. 
ALLY You're the second member of this family I've washed dishes with. 
Beat. 
DIANE He was doing it to impress you. He's never washed a dish in his life. 
66   INT. CAROLINE'S ROOM.                                     66 
Caroline at her desk, sketching. Her door is ajar. Ally enters, mouth agape as she lays eyes on Caroline's collection of artwork on the walls. 
ALLY Wow. 
Caroline's working on a PORTRAIT OF TYLER ON A PARK BENCH, cigarette dangling from his bottom lip. A perfect rendering of a fleeting moment. 
ALLY May I? 
Caroline shrugs. Ally looks over Caroline's shoulder. 
ALLY That's exactly him. It's like the cigarette is the last Coca Cola in the desert. 
Caroline smiles. 
ALLY I can't believe he smokes in front of you. 
CAROLINE Don't worry, I'm not that impressionable. 
Ally smiles. Caroline goes back to work. Ally looks around at all the portraits papering her walls. It stirs a memory. 
ALLY You know when I was younger, we didn't have air conditioning in the house, so during the summer my mom and I would go to museums to cool down... she loved them all but The Met was always her favorite. 
CAROLINE Mine too. The Met is one of my favorite places in the world. 
ALLY So... I heard you've got an art exhibit coming up. 
CHARLES It has to do with significant ball playing. You were a Yankees fan when you were little. You were Lou Piniella for Halloween. 
TYLER Blind familial allegiance. I didn't know what overpriced, overfed, fat bastards they were. 
CHARLES (serious as a heart attack) Who's fat? What Yankee is fat? Tell me. 
TYLER (right back at him) It's a metaphor... 
Charles adjusts his tie and goes back to his steak. 
TYLER Roger Clemens. 
Charles looks at his son. Puts his fork down. 
Silence at the table. 
Back to the steak. 
Beat. 
ALLY Shane Spencer. 
Charles looks up, taken aback. 
ALLY Nick Johnson. 
Tyler tries to get a word in. 
CHARLES (his mouth full of steak) He's big boned! 
Charles and Ally burst out laughing. Tyler rolls his eyes 
--TIME CUT 
Dessert. Ally is working on an enormous profiterole. Tyler, another whiskey. 
CHARLES How long has your dad been a cop? 
ALLY Twenty-two years. 
His cell phone lights up. Charles gently puts his hand on hers. 
CHARLES Would you excuse me please... I'm so sorry. 
ALLY It's OK. 
Charles gets up from the table. Tyler, not able to help himself, shoots him a glance. Ally clocks it. 
ALLY It's just a call. He held out 'til dessert. 
Charles returns. 
CHARLES I'm sorry...And your mother? 
ALLY She passed away when I was eleven. 
CHARLES Ah. 
ALLY She was murdered. I was there. 
Charles and Tyler are stunned to silence. 
ALLY (to Tyler) I never told you that part. 
TYLER Why are you saying this now? 
ALLY I don't know. 
The men look at her. She's a hero. 
CHARLES And, here you are. 
ALLY Yup. Here I am. 
70   INT. CRAIG FAMILY HOME. KITCHEN.                            70 
There is an empty Lean Cuisine box, and two empty Beer Cans on the counter. 
Craig stands by the microwave as it counts down...4,3,2,1. BEEP. He removes an Eggplant Parmigiana and slides it carefully on to a waiting plate. 
He takes it, along with a fresh beer, to the living room. He sits heavily on the sofa and hits a remote, unpausing ERIN BROCKOVICH. 
71   EXT. IN FRONT OF THE FOUR SEASONS-- LATER                    71 
Tyler and Ally wait in front of the restaurant as Charles takes another call. A TOWN CAR and DRIVER wait as well. 
TYLER You have a daughter who sincerely believes you don't like her. 
CHARLES If I have any questions about what my daughter may believe, I'll let you know. 
Tyler gestures with the portrait 
TYLER Don't you at least want to know her? She's telling you something, Dad. She's communicating. Why aren't you riveted? Why isn't this the most important thing? At least for one night of your life? 
CHARLES I've heard this song before, Tyler. 
SUBORDINATE#1 We can come back... 
The subordinates rise. 
CHARLES It's fine, Khaleel. 
They sit. 
There is still distance between the two men. 
Beat. 
CHARLES Who is this display for? 
TYLER You, Mr. Roth. 
Beat. 
CHARLES She knows I will take care of her. 
TYLER And...? 
The subordinates rise again. 
SUBORDINATE#1 We really can come back another... 
CHARLES Sit the fuck down. 
They sit. 
CHARLES And that I love her. I love her. Good God, you toss that word around like currency. You have no idea what it means. 
TYLER Maybe not. Maybe Caroline doesn't either. Where would she have learned it? 
CHARLES I have provided her world. And yours. 
TYLER That does not mean you're allowed to shatter it whenever there's something better to do. 
CHARLES Who the hell do you think you're talking to? You pedaled down here on your bike for Christ's sake. You have to take care of nothing. You are responsible for no one. You're a kid. You think you're the first one to lose anything? Do you think that there is anything you feel that I haven't already felt? 
TYLER You didn't find him. I found him. And you're so tragically blind, the rest of your children are going to hang themselves on your watch. 
Charles goes, snarling, for his son, and Tyler is more than willing. 
Janine and one of the Subordinates get between them. 
JANINE Stop! Stop! 
The men are pulled apart. Tyler is white and trembling with rage. Charles' face is completely dark and closed. 
JANINE Get out of here Tyler. 
Tyler runs for the door. Stumbling over furniture, Caroline's portrait crushed under his feet. 
75   INT. RAILROAD FLAT -- RIGHT AFTER.                        75 
Ally, still in her dress, trying to excavate an ice tray frozen in the ancient freezer. There's got to be six inches of frost in there. She starts stabbing it with a wooden spoon. As she hears the door, she turns and puts on her most blistering attitude like an overcoat. As Tyler walks into the light-- his face white with anger, practically crying-- her eyes widen... 
ALLY Oh my God. 
She runs to him, he falls into her. He's a mess. He won't let her see his face. She pushes at his hair, trying to see and understand. He kisses her, so she won't see. Tyler is completely lost in the storm and Alicia Santana Craig is going to get him through. 
ALLY Okay. 
She yanks his head up. 
ALLY It's okay. 
They kiss. She brings his hands up into her hair, around her face. They kiss. He kisses her like he's starved for her. 
CUT TO: 
76   TYLER'S BEDROOM -- LATER                                      76 
Tyler and Ally, wrapped around each other, both deeply asleep. 
ALLY White girl. 
AIDAN Please. Like falling off a log. As a matter of fact... 
ALLY Shut up. Black girl. 
AIDAN But of course. 
ALLY Asian. 
AIDAN Twice. 
ALLY Latina. 
AIDAN Oui! 
ALLY A Latin girl actually slept with you? What's her name? She's out of the club. 
Tyler is laughing. Ally thinks for a moment. 
ALLY Eskimo. 
Aidan gives a satisfied smile. 
TYLER/ALLY No way! 
AIDAN Monica Ipellie. She works at the Public Library on 96th street. 
ALLY You slept with an Eskimo? 
TYLER You went to the library? 
The car doors open and a MAN ushers his family through.   It's Craig's partner Leo, in plain clothes. 
AIDAN Inuit. In-u-it, Ally. Try not to show your ignorance. 
ALLY I don't believe you. 
AIDAN Fine. Nice girl. While we were doing it, I couldn't get this little, like, song out of my head... 
He begins to bob his head to a rhythm. 
AIDAN "Inuit, bum buh bum, I'm banging an Inuit, bum buh bum buh bum..." 
Ally and Tyler collapse in laughter as Craig's Partner passes He notices Ally immediately. She doesn't see him. He takes a long look at Tyler as he follows his wife and kids into the next car. 
ALLY Prove it. Ten bucks. 
The train makes a stop at Patchogue. Leo and family disembark. 
AIDAN You wanna go to the library? 
ALLY The minute we get off this train. 
AIDAN Fine. 
ALLY Tyler, are you coming? 
TYLER I'll skip this particular bloodbath, thank you. 
80   INT. TYLER'S APARTMENT BUILDING -- HALLWAY -- LATER          80 
Tyler, his bag on his shoulder, returning home, fishing in his pocket for his keys. 
He sings the Inuit song to himself... 
TYLER bum buh bum bum buh bum buh bum... 
His front door is unlocked. 
Tyler freezes. Takes a beat. Scans the room, silently dropping his bag. He reaches behind him for the aluminium bat against the door. Wielding it, he takes two steps into the apartment. 
Craig, in plain clothes, sitting on Tyler's bed, amidst the carnage of Tyler's stuff. He has been rifling through everything. The guitar is propped haphazardly against the wall. 
Craig looks up. The men lock eyes. 
Craig's eyes go to the bat. 
Tyler leans it slowly against the wall. 
Beat. 
CRAIG Where is she? 
TYLER What are you doing in my house? 
ALLY I hate him! 
She lunges for the phone. Tyler stops her hand. 
TYLER There's more. 
She looks like she's starting to panic. 
TYLER He knows me. Before I met you. He arrested me and Aidan. He gave me that gash over my eye. 
ALLY I don't understand. 
TYLER I mouthed off to him. He ... responded. Then Aidan saw you guys together at school. 
She isn't quite getting it. 
TYLER Aidan suggested...I...introduced myself to you. 
She's got it. 
Beat. 
TYLER Ally... 
ALLY I'm going to be sick. 
She bolts from the chair to the sink and dry heaves. Tyler reaches out to comfort her. 
TYLER Hey. 
She reels around and cracks him across the face. Not like a chick. Like her dad. 
The sound hangs in the air. 
Ally goes to the bedroom and starts throwing her stuff in her bag. Tyler follows her. 
TYLER Don't do that. What are you doing? 
ALLY Do you realize what you've done? 
TYLER Yeah. 
He doesn't. 
ALLY Did you think I would never find out? I mean, think about it. I had to find out eventually. You set it up that way. 
TYLER But it doesn't mean anything. I didn't mean to hurt you, 
ALLY No. That's exactly what you meant to do. 
She pushes past him and out the door. 
82   INT. TYLER'S APARTMENT BUILDING -- STAIRWELL --           82 
Ally heads down. Aidan heads up. He smiles wide. 
AIDAN Hey. 
Ally pushes past him. 
ALLY Prick. 
83   INT. RAILROAD FLAT-- LATER THAT NIGHT                     83 
Tyler sitting on the ratty couch. Aidan eats old Chinese food from the container. He offers some to Tyler. They sit in silence. Tyler swelling. Aidan eating. 
AIDAN You had to tell her eventually... 
This is no comfort. 
AIDAN Glass half full... you just saved yourself an awkward Thanksgiving. 
Sincere now. 
AIDAN She'll be back, T. 
Tyler heads into his bedroom and shuts the door. 
84   INT. CRAIG FAMILY HOME -- KITCHEN -- NIGHT                  84 
Sergeant Craig working on a sink full of dirty dishes. He scrubs at a filthy pan with a piece of steel wool. He's manic but there's not a beer can in sight. 
ALLY O/S You know you're not supposed to use that on non-stick pans... 
Craig turns, finds her there in the doorway, bag at her feet. 
ALLY And... 
Craig popping back like an eel from a wreck.    He's got the mangled Honey Bear. 
ALLY Dad... 
He goes again. Pfft. Aidan's visibly relieved. 
AIDAN Tyler's not. 
She starts to close the door. 
AIDAN Wait. Shit. This isn't really my thing. 
ALLY He lied to me. 
AIDAN He's in love with you. 
ALLY He'd like to think he is. 
Aidan doesn't get it. 
AIDAN I don't know what that means...I've seen him look at one other girl the way he looks at you. She's a lot shorter and shares his DNA. 
Ally looks away. 
AIDAN You don't have to forgive him today... just forgive him. 
Craig reappears from the deep. 
CRAIG Thanks for stopping by. 
Father and daughter go back into the house. 
Aidan exhales. 
91   INT. HOFFMAN FAMILY HOME -- CAROLINE'S BEDROOM -- LATER      91 
Diane is on the house phone, preparing a tray of tea and cinnamon toast for Caroline as she talks. 
DIANE Are you telling me, Ms. Spencer, that you intend to let those girls stay in your school?...Of course they're all sticking to the same story and that story is a load of crap!... 
She slams a cabinet closed as Les picks up the tray and WE TRACK HIM down the hall to CAROLINE'S ROOM. Les is speaking on his cell phone. 
LES (sotto, into the phone) She's pretty traumatized. I wanted to pull some names together in case we all decide she should talk to someone... 
92   INT. CAROLINE'S BEDROOM.                                     92 
Caroline and Tyler are lying on Caroline's bed. Her head is nestled on his shoulder. She looks even tinier than usual. Tyler is reading to her, softly, from The Book of Greek Myths, his other hand stroking her butchered hair. 
She looks pale, wasted. Her eyes are sunken and she's fighting sleep. A losing battle, she's exhausted. Her lids finally shutter to the sound of her brother's voice. 
Les, at the door, places the tray on Caroline's desk... 
LES (on the phone) There's no witnesses and it didn't happen on school property. The school won't do anything. They'll probably get away with it... 
Tyler's eyes, registering anger and shock, jump from the page as he hears this. 
93   INT. FOYER.                                                  93 
Diane opening the front door for Aidan and Ally. Aidan wraps his arms around Diane and gives her a hug. Ally hangs back a bit, unsure, then embraces Diane. 
Tyler emerges from the hallway. 
TYLER (to Diane) She's asleep. 
He sees Aidan and Ally. Stops short. 
94   EXT. FRONT STEPS -- LATER                                    94 
Tyler alone on the top stair, taking long pulls from a cigarette. Ally comes out the front door, softly closes it behind her. 
TYLER Last one ever. I swear. 
ALLY I don't care. 
Beat. 
TYLER I know you're not here for me but, thank you for being here. 
A silent moment passes. 
TYLER For what it's worth, I think you're amazing. 
ALLY It's not worth much. You made everything between us a lie. 
Tyler nods. 
Charles appraises his son. 
CHARLES Try not to vandalize any more schools in the meantime. 
Charles walks ahead, pulling out his cell phone. 
Tyler calls after him. 
TYLER Thank you for bailing me out. 
Charles, without turning around, 
CHARLES No problem. 
101   EXT. NYU -- FRONT STEPS -- BEAUTIFUL SEPTEMBER MORNING     101 
Tyler leaning against the bike rack, waiting. He sees Ally running up the steps and watches her as she blends into the crowd. 
102   EXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK -- JUST AFTER.                 102 
No mimes, just dealers. Ally with a girlfriend, walking towards the East Side. Tyler catches up to her. 
Shakes the friend's hand. After a beat, Ally agrees to walk with him. He reaches for her hand. She pulls it away, but walks next to him. 
103   EXT. CENTRAL PARK -- ALICE STATUE -- JUST AFTER.            103 
Tyler has convinced Ally to come uptown and meet Caroline with him. 
Tyler and Caroline climb all over the Alice, while Ally watches from a bench. 
As befitting a seventh grader, Caroline turns her face to the sun and arranges herself to take advantage of the early September tanning possibilities. 
Tyler walks over to Ally's bench, sits next to her. 
Beat. 
ALLY Using the little sister is dirty pool. 
TYLER (carefully) Is it working? 
Beat. 
ALLY Maybe. 
Tyler has a smile the size of New York City. 
Ally smiles back. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
104   INT. TYLER'S BEDROOM -- THE NEXT MORNING                    104 
Bright sun pouring through the window. Ally lying asleep. 
Tyler is up and dressed now, he grabs his journal off his desk, kneels beside Ally. He is bathed in the pool of light streaming in. 
TYLER (nuzzling) Hey...Hey. 
ALLY Hmmm. 
TYLER I'll be back in an hour. I have to stop by my dad's office. 
ALLY (sleepily) Do you want french toast or pancakes for breakfast? 
TYLER Whichever tastes better a la mode. 
Ally smiles. 
ALLY Say hi to your dad for me. 
Tyler watches her lying there. 
TYLER If I said I love you... what would you say? 
ALLY (laughing) I love you. 
TYLER I love you too. 
Tyler kisses her. Then heads out into the... 
105   INT. LIVING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER                        105 
Aidan passed out on the couch still wearing the clothes he went out in the night before. Tyler watches him sleep. 
113   EXT. PRIVATE SCHOOL -- LATER                                113 
That line of luxury cars dropping their daughters off. Charles' Town car rolls to a stop. Caroline gives him a kiss on the cheek. It registers, sort of. She gets out. Charles watches her all the way into the school. 
His DRIVER sees him watching Caroline in the rear view mirror. 
Charles gives the Driver a look "you're waiting for an invite?" 
The Driver peels out. 
114   INT. TYLER'S APARTMENT -- KITCHEN -- LATER                  114 
Ally has made a mess making french toast. Aidan is yakking on his phone. 
115   INT. TOWN CAR -- LATER                                      115 
Charles in traffic. All around him DRIVERS curse, honk, hate each other. Charles rides, not letting it bug him. 
116   INT. PRIVATE SCHOOL -- CLASSROOM -- LATER                   116 
Caroline drawing at her desk as her Teacher comes in and gets ready to start the day. 
117   INT. CHARLES ROTH'S OFFICE -- LATER                      117 
Tyler is still watching the screen saver when Janine enters. 
JANINE Good Morning, Mister Roth. 
TYLER Did you know about this? 
Janine walks around the desk in time to see a photo of Tyler and Michael naked in the tub pop up. She smiles. 
JANINE Who do you think scanned all the pictures? 
Tyler smiles. Janine smiles, Then a photo of Michael comes up. Those smiles fade. Silence. 
JANINE How old would he be? 
TYLER Twenty-nine last May. 
Tyler stands and looks out one of the floor-to-ceiling windows separated by columns. He stares out at mid town and a perfect blue sky. Janine looks befuddled. 
JANINE It's really been that long? I could've sworn it was... 
TYLER May 18, 1993. 
A silent moment passes. Janine reflecting. 
JANINE I should be able to remember that. I'm sorry. 
Tyler looks at her, his face easy... 
TYLER It's okay. 
118   INT. PRIVATE SCHOOL -- CLASSROOM -- LATER                118 
Caroline's Teacher writes the date on the board as Caroline sits quietly doodling. The teacher looks her way. 
TEACHER Caroline? Hello? 
WIDE SHOT of the blackboard. It's unmistakable: 
SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 
119   EXT. CHARLES ROTH'S OFFICE -- LATER                         119 
We're now looking at Tyler from just outside Charles' office window and we're PULLING BACK... 
Until we see Tyler framed in the window surrounded by eerily familiar grey metal siding... 
Until we see can barely see Tyler and the base of a giant white antenna... 
Until we can no longer see Tyler as he's disappeared into the composite of the building and we've pulled back far enough to reveal that Tyler is standing in a window on the... 
92nd Floor of The North Tower of the World Trade Center. 
A moment of still perfect silence. The Towers. The blue sky. 
Then we hear the faint sound of AA Flight 11's ENGINES as it closes in on the North Tower. 
CUT TO BLACK. Silence. Darkness. We wait in it. 
TYLER V/O Whatever you do in life will be insignificant but it is very important that you do it because... 
120   EXT. LOWER MANHATTAN -- THAT MORNING                        120

Written by 
John Romano 
Based on the novel by 
Michael Connelly 
July 8, 2006 
BANG IN FROM BLACK, FACE OF A MAN MICKEY HALLER, 40, lawyer-- TIGHT on him, as morning light flies across his features. He's fresh-shaved, neat suit, gazes out with a stark/steady focus from the back seat of-- 
INT. LINCOLN TOWN CAR (MOVING) IN A HARD RAIN-- 
GRADUALLY FADE IN, under the SOUND of rain & freeway, his DRIVER, black, 20s, low patter to which Mick barely listens-- 
EARL I'm thinkin', when Not-Guilty- Two gets to four thousand miles, that's two cars ready, that's enough to start the airport runs... (then, realizing) You gettin' any of this, Mr. Haller? Not this morning. Mick watches the rain without seeing it. 
MICK Just keep your speed up, Earl. Earl kicks it, passes cars... Mick takes a FILE from a stack beside him. Also laptop, cell- phone rack: His back seat is his rolling office. Opens the file. Top sheet: THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA v. LOUIS ROULET. Tight on Mick. His eyes see back to the be innin CUT TO, 
EXT. LINCOLN (MOVING) - BRIGHT SUN - ANOTHER MORNING 
The town car sails along, bright glint off the surface streets-- We HEAR HARD RAP, TUPAC SHAKUR-- CELL PHONE RINGS-- 
INT. LINCOLN (MOVING) - SAME TIME 
MICK Earl-- buds. A command. Earl puts in earbuds, Rap cuts out. Into cell-- 
MICK (CONT'D) This is Haller. 
MAN'S VOICE OVER CELL Where are you this morning? 
This time Mick's in a mussed suit, surrounded by newspapers, open files, electric shaver, take-out coffee... 
MICK On my way to Lancaster for a calendar call. Why, have you got something? 
MAN'S VOICE (VAL) I got a franchise player is what. Reaction Mick: He's heard it before... 
VAL'S VOICE I mean it, this guy could be money. But he goes before the judge at eleven. 
MICK Van Nuys by eleven could be hard-- 
VAL'S VOICE But this client, listen Mick, his mother's lawyer just waltzed in 
HERE-- 
MICK He's already got a lawyer?-- 
VAL'S VOICE Strictly real-estate, doesn't know his ass about criminal. Will you listen? 
MICK 
GO AHEAD-- 
VAL'S VOICE Guy waltzes in, ready to put up the family's beach house in Malibu against the million in bail... 
MICK A million? What'd they book him on? 
VAL'S VOICE He picked up a girl last night-- Whatever went down she ended up pretty bad. Cops want Aggravated Assault with G.B.I.-- 
MICK Has the D.A. filed yet? 
VAL'S VOICE No. See? I'm giving you ground floor. So make it work for me, Mick. Don't let him use the house, get him to go for my bond-- Meanwhile the Lincoln's approaching the Lancaster courthouse, there are cars, people-- a traffic jam. To Earl-- 
MICK Bring me around to the employee's gate, I'll talk my way in. (into cell, writes) I'm at the courthouse. Give me the name. 
VAL'S VOICE That would be Louis Roulet... 
(PRONOUNCED ROO-LAY) R-O-U-L-E-T, like the wheel. 
MICK That's not how you spell the wheel but I got it, thanks. 
VAL'S VOICE Remember: I steered him to you. 
MICK You're on my Christmas list, Val. Lincoln swings abruptly to a steel gate. "EMPLOYEES." 
LORNA A couple of DUI's, I quoted them the house number. That's it, you're free after Roulet. 
MICK Good. Then I can go to County lock- up. Under which Mick sees Earl indicate something on the road... while Lorna reacts to what Mick said, exasperated... 
LORNA You're going to see Gloria. Why do you waste time on her, Mickey? Mick sees where Earl's pointing: SQUAD OF MOTORCYCLES, HARLEYS, IN THE SIDE-VIEW MIRRORS... They pull up alongside: gang jackets, black leather vests... Big guys... 
EARL Want me to do somethin' about this? 'Cause I can. 
MICK Ignore them, you're doing fine. FACE OF THE LEADER OF THE MOTORCYCLES, leers at Mick through window, as Mick ignores, answers Lorna re "Gloria": 
MICK (CONT'D) What can I say, Lorn, I've got a soft spot for redheads. Why do you think I married you? 
LORNA The divorce papers called it temporary insanity. 
MICK Lucky for you there was a cure. When-- Earl interrupts, insistent now-- 
EARL Mr. Haller? Calling his attention to-- THE MOTORCYCLES HAVE PULLED IN FRONT. The leader signals Earl to pull off. Mick sees they're surrounded. Shit. 
EXT. OFF-RAMP FOR VASQUEZ ROCKS STATE PARK - CONTINUOUS 
The Lincoln follows the Harleys off, PULLS TO A STOP in a lot at the crest of the exit. Jagged rocks, craggy peaks. The leader gets off his bike. EDDIE VOGEL, nearly 300 lbs. Skull & halo patch on leather vest-- same as Harold's tattoo. The "Road Saints." Mick lowers a window. 
EDDIE Counsellor, how's it hanging? 
MICK Fine, Eddie, how's it with you? 
EDDIE 
(CASUAL) Hard Case called me from the pen, he said I might catch up to you. Said you're stalling his case til you see more green, is that right? 
MICK If you want me to work you've gat to pay me. 
EDDIE We paid you. Five thousand. 
MICK That's long gone. I could tell you half went to the aerial-photo expert. He's going to blow the state's case by showing that the DEA violated the air space over Harold's farm by flying too low... but you don't need to know that. All you need to know is, we had a deal. Time to refill the tank. Eddie smiles. Taps the side of the Lincoln. 
EDDIE Sure, gas-guzzler like this. I heard you got three more. What's one man need with four Lincolns? 
MICK 
EDDIE-- 
EDDIE What? You want another five grand? 
MICK Ten. I'm flying the guy in from Kodak in New York, he wants business class... 
EDDIE And I want Harold back on the farm. He's the best farmer we got, if you know what I mean... 
MICK I don't. And I don't want to. Either pay me my money or go with the Public Defender the judge finds you. Of course he won't know much about air space, but-- 
EDDIE Keep your shirt on, Counsellor. We want you. He reaches into a vest with his big hand. Thick envelope. Mick takes it. Starts to count, and realizes: 
MICK You had the whole ten ready. What if you'd backed me down to five? 
EDDIE This vest got lots of pocket. Eddie taps another pocket and GRINS. one tooth missing. 
INT. VAN NUYS COURTHOUSE - HOLDING CELL - DAY 
CAMERA MOVING ON: EIGHT MEN, prisoners in grey jumpers. Six are black. Of the two white men, one's a wet-eyed, skanky JUNKIE, 40s. The OTHER is a tall young man, somehow polished even in prison outfit, definitely out of place here-- 
MICK Louis Roulet? LOUIS turns: the proverbial deer-in-the-headlights: Scared. 
MICK (CONT'D) My name is Michael Haller. I had a call. 
LOUIS Yes-- Mr. Haller-- Mick stands behind a painted line three feet from the cell. Signals Louis to come to the bars to talk. Louis approaches, 
FREAKED-- 
LOUIS (CONT'D) I-- called you because I need 
SOMEONE-- 
MICK You want me to represent you for your first appearance. I get twenty- five hundred for that. We can work out what comes next. 
LOUIS Thank you-- This is a set-up, Mr. Haller-- I made a mistake with that woman, she was setting me up-- 
MICK Keep your voice down. And don't say anything about the case, not til I've got you out on bail. Okay? Mick's voice, as always, is easy and calm. Louis nods. 
(YIELDS) Alright I'll go quietly. But after today's hearing, if you don't object. 
MICK Depends. You going for no-bail? 
MAGGIE That won't change with the prosecutor. Not with what your guy did. With which she shows him the photo: gruesome. 
MICK If he did it. 
MAGGIE Sure. "If." They only picked him up in her home with blood all over him, but it's a valid question... 
MICK I love it when you're sarcastic. Can I at least see the arrest report? 
MAGGIE Get it from whoever takes over. No favors on this one. 
Mick looks admiringly at Maggie. At her passion. 
MICK How's Hayley? A beat. Off the sudden shift in topic, Maggie starts putting away the things on her desk... 
MAGGIE She's good. She likes the things you send her but would rather you show up yourself... 
MICK How about this weekend? This takes her by surprise. But she takes him up on it. 
MAGGIE Okay, I'll tell Hayley. Tonight. Only Mick-- don't cancel on her. 
CUT TO, INT. COURTROOM - LATER 
A TV CAMERA is trained toward LOUIS in the HOLDING AREA, he tries avoiding it... while MICK AND MAGGIE are ARGUING IN 
FRONT OF THE JUDGE... 
MICK Judge, there is no way the state can claim my client is a flight 
RISK-- 
MAGGIE With resources like this man has, it's always a risk-- let alone the fact that the victim was brutally 
ASSAULTED-- 
JUDGE Ms. McPherson, the extent of her injuries are not the point. I'm setting bail at a million dollars... Mick wins, Maggie loses. Exchange glances-- 
WE'RE-- INT. DOORS TO THE COURTROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Mick bangs out, always moving. Getting the door for him is his friend, bail bondsman "VAL" VALENZUELA, excited-- 
VAL What'd I tell you, Mick, we got us a franchise... 
MICK We'll see, Val... 
VAL There's the lawyer-guy, you get him to go for the cash-bond... MOVING from Val, Mick HEADS DOWN THE HALL, through the BUSY CRUSH of attorneys, clients, spectators to-- DOBBS, waiting. 
MICK Cecil Dobbs? 
DOBBS Mr. Haller. (They shake hands.) It was depressing to see the boy caught up in that cattle call... 
MICK Boy? 
DOBBS I've represented the family so long I think of Louis that way. 
MICK He did look a little frail. My advice is, let Mr. Valenzuela fix you up with a bond and take "the boy" home. 
DOBBS A bond? But Mrs. Windsor was thinking of putting up property... 
MICK No good. Assessing it will take days. By then Louis might be carrying somebody's child. (before Dobbs can argue) So just tap Val for the bond, spring Louis, and take him to your office. We'll meet there at Four. And heads off again. Dobbs follows him out, to... 
EXT. VAN NUYS COURTHOUSE, DAY - MICK AND DOBBS 
Sunlight. Where Dobbs suddenly TENSES as he SEES: A TV CAMERAMAN coming out with camera. Off Dobbs's reaction-- 
MICK Yep. Media's already picked us up. 
DOBBS Mrs. Windsor's sensitive about the press... Mick, a beat. Then calls the cameraman over. When he comes-- 
MICK I saw you in there filming. What's your name? 
CAMERAMAN Rob Gillen. They call me "Sticks." 
MICK You freelancing on this, Sticks? 
MICK (writes, likes this--) Did you screen him? 
GLORIA Don't I screen 'em all? 
MICK off what, his driver's license? 
GLORIA No, his passport. I think his name was, Hector, or-- 
MICK Hector what? Last name. Think. 
INT. CRIMINAL COURTS BUILDING, L.A. - D.A.'S OFFICE - DAY 
MICK Moya. Hector "Arrande" Moya is what you get if you run a trace. He's Colombian, a fugitive from a Grand Jury indictment down in Florida. The DEA wants him for drug trafficking. The D.A.'s LESLIE FAIRE: a woman, well-dressed, humorless. 
MICK (CONT'D) Leslie? They want him a lot. 
LESLIE FAIRE And your girl's looking to trade? 
MICK She'll give you his motel and room number. 
LESLIE FAIRE She'll also have to testify on the coke. 
MICK That's a No. Location only. Your guys take it from there. My investigator says Hector hasn't checked out yet. 
LESLIE FAIRE (as she weighs it) What's she want in exchange? 
MICK You drop charges, and all she does is a Pre-trial Rehabilitation. The facility at USC-Med would be nice. (when she hesitates) Or do I take this straight to the Feds? Which, though veiled, is a threat. Leslie hates this. 
INT. DOBBS'S CENTURY CITY LAW OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 
HIGH FLOOR, TALL WINDOWS. DOBBS, ON THE CUT, lets in MICK. Mick's checking the impressive room, vast views all the way to the Pacific, as the OTHERS enter behind him: MARY WINDSOR (distinguished, 60), LOUIS (suit, silk t-shirt, Ray-bans.) Another man, 45, thickly built, enters at Mick's side. 
MICK Mrs. Windsor, this is Raul Levin. Mr. Levin's my investigator. Accepting this, everyone takes their place at the long, blonde-wood conference table. Mick can't help run his hand over the surface, everything's a contrast to his own on-the- fly office... Dobbs, to Mrs. Windsor... 
DOBBS Mrs. Windsor, I can't commend Mr. Haller highly enough for his performance in court this morning. Mary Windsor nods, provisionally pleased. 
MARY WINDSOR I have a check for you, Mr. Haller. And slides it towards him in an envelope. Mick, tries not to seem too much in a hurry as he glances inside-- ANGLE, we glimpse the amount, the zeroes... $100,000... BUT: 
MICK I'm going to need that to come from your son, Mrs. Windsor. (slides it back to her) You can give him the money so he can write the check. But I want the check to come from Louis. He's my client and that's got to be clear from the start. No offense. 
She is offended-- but takes back the envelope, nods to LOUIS. He takes out a checkbook, writes. Mick continues to Mary-- 
MICK (CONT'D) Thank you. I'll expect you to support your son through this in other ways. If you're willing. 
MARY WINDSOR Don't be silly. I'll back my son come hell or high water. These ridiculous charges. That ridiculous woman. 
MICK It's good to know you'll be there when we need you. 
MARY WINDSOR But not now, is that it? 
MICK We'll be going over the case. The D.A. could make you testify about what you hear. Attorney privilege doesn't cover you. Mary Windsor's motionless a moment. Rather than respond, she simply rises. To Louis-- 
MARY WINDSOR I will see you at dinner. And goes. Dobbs gets the door for her. When she's gone: 
LOUIS My mother built a good business. From the ground up. 
MICK I've got no trouble believing that. (after a beat) I say we get started. All agree, they sit, Mick starts up-- 
MICK (CONT'D) Our first choice is whether we waive our right to a speedy trial. 
LOUIS No. I want this behind me. 
MICK You sure? You can stretch things out, enjoy your freedom. Most clients... 
LOUIS Guilty clients, you mean. I want this over. Mick's struck by how firm. 
MICK Fine. We go to trial right away. Puts more pressure on the D.A. 
DOBBS Or maybe the case never even goes to trial. (They look at him.) Our firm's clout is considerable. Pressure can be brought to bear-- 
MI C K Don't kid yourself, Cecil. (to Dobbs and Louis) No way the state is dropping these charges. In fact, they've already upped them-- to improve their negotiating position. 
LOUIS There won't be any negotiating. (before Mick can speak) No plea bargain, no nothing. I'm not going to jail for something I didn't do. 
MICK It might not be jail. 
LOUIS Even if I walk. I'm innocent and if there's a trial I want to get on the stand and tell the jury I'm innocent. If that's a problem we can part company right now. Mick looks at the young man. Evaluating. Then... 
Conference table's silent. All looking at Louis. 
MICK Okay then. What do you remember next? 
LOUIS Waking up with two guys sitting on me. Holding me down. 
QUICK CUT TO, REGGIE'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM... TWO GUYS straddle Louis who is face down on the floor. LOUIS (V.0.) (cont'd) Couple of faggots from next door. 
BACK TO, LAW OFFICE 
RAUL Police report has them, homosexual couple from down the hall... 
LOUIS Like I said. Faggots. To which Raul says nothing. After a beat-- 
MICK Go on, Louis. 
LOUIS I was still foggy when the cops came... 
BACK TO, LIVING ROOM... Louis is cuffed by now, hands behind him, COP looms over... LOUIS (V.O.) (cont'd) She was on the couch telling all these lies... PARAMEDICS work on Reggie's bloodied face while, to a FEMALE COP (MAXWELL), through sobs, still frightened-- 
REGGIE .he was like an animal! He said he'd rape me and kill me... then rape me again when I was dead... Louis looks around at his left hand in a plastic ba Bloody. 
LOUIS (V.O. ) That's when I saw she'd set it up. 
BACK TO, LAW OFFICE. 
MICK Set it up how? 
LOUIS Put blood on my hand. My left hand. But I'm right-handed, I'd use my right if I was going to... punch someone. Which is crazy. Louis mimes throwing a punch, in the air. Inept. 
DOBBS Louis never hit anyone in his life. 
RAUL What she did made sense. It's the right side of her face that was hit, she had to bloody your left. 
MICK Louis: You said she opened the door a crack. Did you see her face? 
LOUIS Not all of it... 
CUT TO, DOOR OF REGGIE'S APARTMENT... OPENING AGAIN... It open a crack. Enough for her look out, half her face... 
LOUIS (V.0.) (cont'd) Mainly her eye. Her left eye. 
RAUL (V.0.) That's it!... BACK TO, LAW OFFICE. Raul... mimes the opening of the door... 
RAUL (CONT'D) She already had the injuries, on the right. She was hiding it from him when he steps in... 
MICK And then she clocks him? 
LOUIS Yes. 
MICK So our case is, she beat herself up? Mick takes the file, takes the 8xl0s, REGGIE'S PULPED FACE... 
MICK (CONT'D) We're saying, she pounded her face into hamburger meat, or had her boyfriend do it, hoping some far- off day a jury would give her a big fat reward? 
LOUIS She must have. 
DOBBS Of course. She saw his Porsche, his Rolex, it's known the family has money... I'll wager she's already filed in civil court. Mick. Thinks. Then, to Raul-- 
MICK Okay, the police report. Let's hear how Reggie tells it. 
CUT TO, INT. DOORWAY TO REGGIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
She's opened a crack, peering out... Raul reads... 
RAUL (V. 0. ) "According to the victim, she was at home alone when the suspect presented himself at the door as someone she knew..." Louis is there, talks MOS. Reggie opens the rest of the way. RAUL (V.0.) (cont'd) "Upon letting him in, she was immediately struck..." WHICH WE SEE: The vicious repeated pounding of her face, bloodying her, but it's too fast & jumbled for details... 
MICK (V.0.) Does it say he knocked her down? She falls... Louis flies down on top of her... 
RAUL (V.0.) Yeah, then straddled her. "Held the victim by the neck until she agreed to cooperate..." Louis does as described, strangle-hold... Eventually lets her up, turning her toward the bedroom. And... RAUL (V.O.) (cont'd) "The suspect maintained a position behind her, holding a knife against the left side of her throat..." 
CLOSE, HAND-HELD, KNIFE-POINT TO NECK, SLIGHT CUT, BLOOD... 
RESUME, INT. LAW OFFICE. 
Raul takes something new from the file: PHOTO OF A BLOODY KNIFE. Sharpened to a point. Louis looks at it. Seethes. 
LOUIS This isn't my knife. 
INT. WINDSOR ESTATES, OUTER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
Behind the reception desk is ROBIN, tan/sexy blonde, hair hanging straight over one eye like a scythe... 
MICK Mickey Haller. Here to see Louis. 
ROBIN Mr. Roulet is with someone. He can't be disturbed. It's like he doesn't hear her-- walks calmly past her-- to -- THE DOOR TO LOUIS ROULET'S OFFICE- Mick ENTERS, finds Louis with his loafers off, on the couch with his cell-phone cradled to his ear. Robin chases behind... 
ROBIN (CONT'D) I'm sorry, Mr. Roulet, this man just came back here-- 
LOUIS It's okay, Robin. You can go. Robin exits. Louis mutters an apology into his cell-phone and rings off. Looks annoyed at Mick. 
LOUIS (CONT'D) I was setting up a showing. 
MICK There won't be any showings in Pelican Bay. 
LOUIS Where's that? 
MICK It's a supermax prison where they send violent sex offenders. You'll fit in real good in your loafers. 
LOUIS What's the matter? 
MICK You lied to me, Louis. I'm about to go and see the new prosecutor, who's doing everything he can to put you away, and now I find out you've been lying. (before Louis can deny) Tell me about Reggie Campo. 
LOUIS What about her? I've told you-- 
MICK You didn't tell me. That you were going to pay her for sex. (off Louis's surprise) You think it's hard to find out somebody's not Snow White? 
LOUIS Alright yes, I was going to pay. She wrote down a price on the napkin, four hundred dollars... 
MICK Why didn't you tell me this in Cecil's office? 
LOUIS I didn't want my mother to know. Cecil tells her everything. And can we keep it down? Her office is on the other side of that door... Mick looks at Louis's concern. Believes it. Easing up... 
MICK This changes things. You see that, don't you? 
LOUIS I'm not a lawyer. Explain it to me. 
MICK Alright I will. You know that guy on the Venice boardwalk? The one who has all those plates spinning on sticks? 
LOUIS What does this have to do with-- 
MICK Just listen. A bunch of spinning plates: that's the state's case. In the middle is a big one. It's a fucking platter. And if that falls it takes the others down with it. (He gets closer to Louis) The big plate is the victim. The only witness against you. I knock her down, the act is over and the crowd goes home. No trial. Mick has Louis' attention now. 
LOUIS You can make this trial go away? 
MICK We've lost time. You concealed from me the fact that could do it. It comes down to why. 
LOUIS Why what? 
MICK Why would a guy with a Porsche and a Rolex need a knife to get sex from a woman who sells it anyway? The answer is, he wouldn't. And when you see that you see the set- up, the trap. And suddenly it's the defendant who looks like the victim. Louis gets it. Penitent. 
LOUIS You're going to the prosecutor now? 
MICK Yes. Young hot-shot named Ted Minton. He wants to give me the discovery file. Poor guy doesn't know that Raul already got it. He's new to felonies but he's no dope. When he hears his vic's a hooker he'll know we've knocked all his plates down. 
LOUIS Then it'll be over? 
MICK No promises, Louis. Louis closes his eyes, savors the prospect. Then sees Mick to the door. When he opens it: MARY WINDSOR's there. Surprised to see Haller. 
MRS. WINDSOR I didn't know you were here. Is there news? 
LOUIS There will be, Mother. And puts out a hand to Mick. Grateful. Hesitating half a beat, Mick shakes it and goes... Louis and his Mother. Regard each other. Face to face. 
INT. VAN NUYS CIVIC CENTER - D.A.'S OFFICE, RECEPTION - DAY 
Mick in a chair. Impatient. Legal secretaries, prosecutors, etc., come and go, when-- a guy Mick recognizes, DETECTIVE KURLEN, fat, 40, approaches a desk with a stack of papers-- 
SECRETARY Are these for A.D.A. Knight? 
KURLEN Yeah, and they're my only copies. I'll wait while you copy them. 
SECRETARY I'll have to ask her... But, he holds them back. Stares. She yields... 
SECRETARY (CONT'D) I'll run them for you now. 
KURLEN Just what I wanted to hear. She goes. Mick tries to avoid Kurlen-- but too late-- 
MICK The fun's watching her. Maggie likes this. Touch glasses. After a quiet moment... 
MAGGIE You didn't know Minton had Corliss til I blabbed, did you. 
MICK He was hiding something, I thought it might be a jailhouse snitch... 
MAGGIE You got me drunk to find out what you wanted to know. Except I was already drunk. Good point, right? He feels something. ANGLE, her hand on his knee... 
MAGGIE (CONT'D) Hayley's probably asleep. I gotta go relieve the sitter-- (makes a face) Only I don't think I can drive myself home. 
MICK one good turn. I'll drive you. 
MAGGIE And will you take me back to get my car in the morning? A loaded proposition. Covers her hand with his own. CUT TO, 
INT. MAGGIE'S BEDROOM - THE BED - MORNING 
ANGLE HAYLEY, sleeping between her two parents. Mick opens his eyes: Maggie's awake and staring at him. Grim. 
MAGGIE This is not fair to her. 
(MICK STIRS--) Waking up and finding you here. She'll get her hopes up. 
MICK How'd she get in here? 
MAGGIE She comes in here when she has nightmares. She has nightmares. 
MICK So she sleeps in here a lot? 
MAGGIE Don't start. You have no idea what it's like raising a child alone. He can tell by her tone: All last night's tenderness gone. 
INT. GUEST BEDROOM DOWN THE HALL - MOMENTS LATER 
He's dressing-- she enters to him in a robe-- 
MICK Look-- I'll leave-- then come back in an hour. We'll go together to get your car then I can take her to 
SCHOOL-- 
MAGGIE Just like that? You're gonna start taking her to school? 
MICK Don't you remember what we talked about last night? 
MAGGIE I thought you were just trying to get into my head on your case-- or get me into bed-- 
MICK (getting angry now) I can't win with you-- 
MAGGIE Not when you're being a defense lawyer! Do you know how crazy we were to think we could ever make it? Me trying to get dirtbags off the street, you keeping them there-- 
MICK 
ALRIGHT MAGGIE-- 
MAGGIE Just go! 
INT. DINER (DUPAR'S) - MORNING - MICK AT THE COUNTER: 
Unshaven. Edward Hopper drabness. To lose himself in work, looks down at his files: An 8x10 OF REGGIE CAMPO'S BATTERED FACE. WAITRESS, 50s, pours coffee. Recoils as she glimpses the picture, the gruesome wounds, Mick didn't mean her to see. 
MICK Sorry. It's work. 
WAITRESS I just hope you catch the bastard who did it to her. And goes. Mick tucks the picture under some papers, to hide it-- but finds that he's only hid it halfway. Leaving half her face exposed. The good half. Something about this... He picks it up again, folds it... 
INT. MEN'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Leaning over the sink, Mick holds the folded photo against the mirror, the unhurt left side showing. Creates a full image of a face. He stares a long time. Then, to himself: 
MICK Martha Renteria. 
INT. ANGLE ON A WAREHOUSE-GARAGE DOOR RISING - FROM WITHIN 
Mick, enters. THREE LINCOLNS LINED UP along a wall. Mick's "fleet." California plates: NT GLTY 1, NT GLTY 3, NT GLTY 4.. Walks past... to some battered file cabinets. He turns on a single-bulb lamp... DRAWER OPENING ON FILE CABINET... Mick's fingers fly through the tabs of old files, stops at: MARTINEZ. Cut to, MARTINEZ FILES ON DESK, MOMENTS LATER: Mick examines them: Police reports, printouts. Until he finds... Autopsy report. Name: RENTERIA, MARIA. Takes out... Bx10 PHOTO: WOMAN DEAD ON A BED, NAKED. Dark bloodstains. NEXT PHOTO - TIGHTER: Knife-wounds. And bruises. NEXT PHOTO - HER FACE: BEATEN: Injuries to the left side (opposite of Reggie's.) Dark-haired, large brown eyes. MICK. Folds this one in half. Takes the folded shot of Reggie, fits them together, crease to crease: So alike, they form what could be the face of one woman. Mick. Not wanting to face the memory: a VOICE in his head: 
MICK'S VOICE I wish you'd called me before you talked to the cops, Jesus... 
GO TO, INT. VAN NUYS JAIL, ATTORNEY/PRISONER ROOM - DAY 
FLASHBACK OF MICK WITH MARTINEZ, who's stalking around, in a panic, while Mick is laying out the bad news... 
GET BACK FROM THE GLASS. OR THE 
INTERVIEW WILL BE TERMINATED. Frustrated, Mick complies-- but calls-- 
MICK Guard! Long beat. Guard enters. Clean-Marine. Mick shows the stack. 
MICK (CONT'D) I need him to look at these. 
GUARD You can't give him anything. 
MICK But if you won't let him close to the glass, how can he see them? 
GUARD That's not my problem. 
MICK All right, but can you stay a minute? If he IDs one of these mug- shots I need you to witness it. 
GUARD Don't drag me into your bullshit. And goes. 
MICK Godammit. (then, to Martinez) Try. See if one is the guy. Mick holds up one after another. Martinez shakes his head no-- Then the booking photo of Louis Roulet. 
Mick holds it up. Off Jesus, as his eyes narrow... 
EXT. AIRLINER LANDING, BURBANK AIRPORT - DAY 
PRE-LAP the YELPING/SNARLING of a small /fierce dog... We're: 
INT. RAUL LEVIN'S BUNGALOW, GLENDALE - EVENING 
Raul in shorts, lets Mick in over the barks of his Shih-Tzu. 
RAUL Cool it, Ahab... C'mon in, Mick... Leaves Mick alone while he puts out the dog-- Mick cools his heels. Takes in: Cubs pennant, Raul's old peaked policeman's cap, mounted... finally pours himself a vodka. Notes the photo of a YOUNGER GUY, its frame hung with the "Fight Aids" ribbon. Raul re-enters. 
MICK (re the drink) I helped myself. 
RAUL It's okay. I owe you, the way I let you down on that discovery file-- 
MICK It wasn't you. The cops set you up. Who was it slipped you the file, anyway? 
RAUL Some guy in vice I play cards with. Lonnie Fry. You don't know him. 
MICK You're right, I don't. But I know who his partner was, when he was in homicide. Kurlen. 
RAUL That prick. I'll make him sorry. 
MICK Don't bother. We've got bigger problems. The way Mick says it. Raul sits, asks-- 
RAUL Like what? Where were you today anyway? You were hard to reach... 
MICK Cell phones don't work too well where I was. Raul waits. Knows this is why Mick came here. 
MICK (CONT'D) I came to tell you a story. About Jesus Martinez. 
RAUL You were at San Quentin. 
MICK It's about what happened after he left Martha Renteria's apartment. 
RAUL After he killed her? 
MICK He never killed her. He went there, had sex, flushed the condom-- 
RAUL Wiped his prick on the pink towel-- 
MICK And then went home. The story starts after he left. 
RAUL 
(GETS IT) The real killer. 
MICK The real killer. She lets him in. 
CUT TO, INT. MARTHA RENTERIA' S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
MICK Maybe he fakes like it's still Martinez and he forgot something. Or maybe it was an appointment... We see the door open but we don't see who enters... 
RAUL (V.O.) The other guy from the club? The one Jesus said he bid against? 
NICK (V.0.) Right. He comes in, punches her a few times to soften her up... Renteria staggers as she's suddenly pummeled, then spun... NICK (V.0.) (cont'd) Then takes out a knife and holds it to her neck while he walks her to the bedroom... We SEE the knife-tip against her throat... MICK (V.0.) (cont'd) Only she isn't lucky like Reggie Campo will be. He climbs on top, puts on a condom, rapes her... CUT TO, BEDROOM, as Mick gives us the action... MICK (V.0.) (cont'd) And when he's done he stabs her over and over, fifty-two times, while he works out something in his sick fucking mind. We SEE, the stabbing, bleeding, then-- 
MAGGIE'S VOICE No you weren't. You don't go to San Francisco, you go to San Quentin. Must have been seeing a client... 
MICK You always were too smart for me. Is Hayley okay? 
MAGGIE'S VOICE She's good. Look, she's playing soccer tomorrow, and she wants you to come to the match. You've started something, Mickey... 
MICK Fine, I look forward to it. 
MAGGIE'S VOICE You'll need to pick her up at noon. But, under this, he sees, DOWN THE HALLWAY, light from a room. Sudden chill. Angling to see, keeping a normal voice... 
MICK Noon, I'll do that. See you then. And hangs up before she can say goodbye.. And Stops. Freezes. Eyes on the LIGHT at the end of the hall. Carefully, Mick begins to move down the hall... Pauses at the door he comes to first, bedroom, dark... Kicks it-- Nothing. starts walking again, when: there's a SOUND. Then silence. What was it?... Mick continues-- to-- The LIT ROOM: SIDE ANGLE, we see it's the den-- Mick braces-- And BURSTS IN SUDDENLY: 
INT. DEN - LOUIS IS THERE... 
Sitting in Mick's chair, leg up on the desk... 
MICK What the hell are you doing here? 
LOUIS Funny thing is I've been here before. I was offered the house to show, never gave back the key-- 
MICK (over,doesn't give a shit) Get out of my house! Now! 
LOUIS (rising, but) 
EASY MICK-- But, sees Mick noticing-- the ELECTRONIC ANKLET on his leg-- 
LOUIS (CONT'D) Your friend Valenzuela put this on. A tracer. As if I were going anywhere. 
MICK I said Get up! Get up and get out of this house! Off Mick's force, Mick's almost crazy-- Louis smirks, goes-- 
EXT. FRONT DOOR, PORCH - MOMENT LATER, AS THEY COME OUT... 
LOUIS (turns to him, to 
"EXPLAIN") I couldn't reach you! I'm on trial for my life, Mick, and I get nervous when I can't reach yout And you were away all day. Like you told "Maggie." Meaning he listened to the call. Mick goes white. 
MICK You don't come near this house again, do you understand me? We aren't friends, we aren't partners, you're my client, eriod-- 
LOUIS Just what I wanted to remind you of. I'm your client. Mick reacts. Louis lets in sink in, then: 
LOUIS (CONT'D) Besides, I like it in your house, Mick... Pretty pictures of your kid, Hayley... 
MICK Fucken don't. 
LOUIS Don't what, don't say she's pretty? But I saw her, the other day at the club... At which, Mick's had enough: belts Louis in the mouth. Quick, solid. 
His lip bloodied, Louis flashes with anger-- but then, just as suddenly, he steels himself. Glares coldly at Mick. 
LOUIS (CONT'D) Okay. Okay I'm going. But-- And extends his hand: with Mick's house-key in it. 
LOUIS (CONT'D) --first I think I should give you back your key. It isn't right that I have it. Now that we can trust each other. Mick takes the key. Panting, he watches Louis go down the fucking steps. 
SUDDEN CUT TO,, EXT. ON HAYLEY: SOCCER MATCH IN PROGRESS 
Hayley, defending, scrambles to get in the way of another girl, a forward, dribbling towards her... ANGLE MICK, on the sideline... among other parents... 
MICK That's it, Hayley, get in her way! Hayley isn't quick enough, the forward dribbles round her, goes in for the score. Hayley looks despondently at Mick-- 
MICK (CONT'D) It's okay, honey! When-- his CELL-PHONE RINGS. Into it-- 
MICK (CONT'D) This is Haller... He strains to listen... Stops cold. His look darkens... Even from the field, Hayley sees this... 
CUT TO, INT. RAUL'S BUNGALOW - DAY 
MOVING ON THE CUT, WITH MICK, as he ENTERS... It's a CRIME SCENE, swarms with cops, forensics, technicians... Mick distressed, moves as if through heavy water. DETECTIVES are leading him: LANKFORD, 38, clean-marine-- and HEIDI SOBEL, 30. They wear paper booties, thin rubber gloves... 
LANKFORD Levin was back in his office... 
SOBEL We wouldn't have found him if a neighbor hadn't brought the dog back. It was running loose. 
LANKFORD (shows a desk calendar) Your name's all over this. Were you the only guy he worked for? 
MICK No, but I've got a big trial next month, attempted rape and murder. He was helping me. 
SOBEL Is that the Roulet case? 
MICK How did you know? 
MICK Where'd you get the money for an eight thousand dollar TV, Val? 
VAL That's bullshit! I didn't do that! How dare you say that to me-- I'm inocente, man-- Mick reacts to the word-- Martinez's word-- as Val glares at him from the ground. 
VAL (CONT'D) Get outa here; Get out of here, Mick, and get outa my life! Mick's already backing off-- towards the car-- 
VAL (CONT'D) Keep going, man! Mick keeps going-- down the drive and into his car-- CUT TO, 
INT. FOUR GREEN FIELDS - NIGHT - MICK AT THE BAR... 
Drinking, CAMERA moves on him, he taps the glass for another. Bartender comes over like he's going to pour one. Mick's keys are on the bar-- Instead of pouring the bartender swipes the keys. Mick looks at him, uncomprehending. 
BARTENDER That's it. You're done here, pal. And you're not driving either. (shows keys, keeps them) Call yourself a cab or something. Off Mick, 
INT. MICK HALLER'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT 
MAGGIE, lugs him into his room, he's a mess... 
MAGGIE Being married to you sucked but it beat being a car service... 
MICK That's the idea, y'know. Car service, with the Lincolns-- Drive the illustrious turds of our city back and forth to LAX-- 
MAGGIE I'll be your first customer. First dollar. And rolls him onto the bed. He looks at her. Drunk as he is: 
MICK Lemme ask you something. Corliss. The name Corliss. You didn't just give me that just because you'd been drinking. You wanted me to have it. She doesn't confirm or deny. Just gets him into bed-- says 
POINTEDLY-- 
MAGGGIE I'm not staying. He knows, but-- one thing more-- 
MICK Maggie-- Raul. Did I get him killed? Moved, she shakes her head no. Straightens his pillow. 
MAGGIE How do you do it, Haller? You're a sleazy defense lawyer with two ex- wives and a daughter, and we all still love you. We STAY ON HIM as she stands up, goes. To no one: 
MICK I can't do this anymore. 
INT. MICK HALLER'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING 
He's in bad shape as he comes out of the bedroom. Stares at the light pouring in from the glass doors onto the porch. Finds: THERE'S A DOLLAR TAPED TO THE GLASS. (From Maggie.) Also: the MESSAGE LIGHT ON HIS PHONE is ON. MOMENTS LATER: He's pressed the button, listens to... 
MACHINE VOICE Message received: YESTERDAY, ELEVEN- 
SEVEN A.M. 
RAUL'S VOICE Mick, it's me. Guess I missed you. Wanted to go over a few things, so I wouldn't interrupt your day with Hayley. Anyway... Presses STOP. Raul's voice: Mick's not sure he can deal. But pulls the pencil & pad near him, and presses START again... RAUL'S VOICE (cont'd) First, that witness name you gave me. Corliss? Turns out he's this hype, Dwayne Jeffrey Corliss, sometimes goes by "DJ." When you run it that way you find out he's played the courtroom snitch a lot, mostly in Arizona. But here's the thing: One time down there? It blew up on him. I'm working on it, it can be good for us... Don't know how we get to him, though. They put him in USC lock-up, just to make it harder... Under which Mick, excited, is writing down D J CORLISS... ARIZONA... then USC, circles this last... RAUL'S VOICE (cont'd) Other thing is, you asked me to dig deep-on Roulet? Mick, I found something. I found Martinez' ticket out of the Q. When, on the tape he hears DOG BARKING... and a DOOR BELL... RAUL'S VOICE (cont'd) Uh, that's somebody at the door... Look, have a good time with your kid. Gotta go, boss. And MESSAGE goes OFF. Mick thinks a moment. Tries to clear his head. Then pulls out a card and dials a number... 
TNTERCUT/ INT. HOMICIDE DIVISION, GLENDALE: SOBEL AT HER DESK 
SOBEL 
(ANSWERS) Detective Sobel. 
MICK 
(INTO PHONE) It's me. Haller. 
(MORE) 
MICK (CONT'D) Look, I-- just checked my phone messages. It turns out Raul called me. Just before he was killed. I didn't know. 
(SHE REACTS) The message came at Eleven-oh- seven. He said, "I think I found Martinez' ticket out of the Q." 
SOBEL 
(WRITING) Meaning Jesus Martinez-- that's a former client of yours-- 
MICK In San Quentin. Right. 
SOBEL Did he say anything else? Looks down at his notes. At "Corliss." "USC." A beat. As he tears off the note, stuffs it in his pocket... 
MICK No-- No, that's it. Then the dog barked, somebody was at the door. He hung up. (before she can ask more) Look, maybe you can tell me if there's any progress on the case. (when she hesitates) He was my friend. Sobel, makes a decision... 
SOBEL Well, we did catch a break. We found a bullet casing in the room, from a 22. It turns out Levin owned a .22, but when we checked it out it wasn't a Woodsman, like the gun that killed him... To which, Mick reacts... as she goes on... 
SOBEL (CONT'D) The other thing is we can't find his cell-phone... (noticing Mick is silent) Are you still there? 
MICK Yeah... just, I'll let you know if I think of anything. About his cell- phone, I mean. Thanks. And hangs up. Too sudden. Leaves Sobel wondering... 
MICK (CONT'D) My name's Michael Haller, and I'm representing Louis Roulet. (glances at Ted) Mr. Minton doesn't want to use the word prostitute for the woman who's supposed to be Louis's victim. He needn't worry, this case isn't about how she makes her money... But it is about her actions. How she saw a young man with signs of wealth, and chose to target him... (closes in on the jury...) What she didn't count on, was you. The fact that you'd put two and two together, and let your common sense tell you who was the real predator. 
CUT TO, INT. COURTROOM CORRIDOR - LATER 
As Mick exits with Lorna for the lunch-break. Low-voiced-- 
LORNA You had a message from Gloria. She thinks she can do what you asked. 
MICK Thinks? 
LORNA Corliss has the same meal time. She can try. 
MICK 
(DISCOURAGED) Let her try. But it may not matter. 
LORNA What do you mean? 
MICK I mean, Corliss isn't on the witness list. It could be Ted Minton is holding him back. He won't use him until he has to. Until I screw up his case so bad he has no choice. 
LORNA Mickey? Can you do that? Off Mick, tries for a confident smile... 
CUT TO, INT. COURTROOM, LATER - ON THE STAND: 
FEMALE COP (MAXWELL) I'd describe Ms. Campo when we got there as... hurt and frightened... 
TED Frightened? 
OFFICER MAXWELL She kept asking us if she was safe, even after Roulet was taken away. 
INT. COURTROOM, LATER 
Mick has Maxwell on cross... Clerk hands her pages... 
MICK Officer, would you read from your arrest report where it's marked? 
OFFICER MAXWELL "The victim does not know the man who assaulted her or why she was attacked." 
MICK Why did you write that she didn't know him? 
OFFICER MAXWELL Because that's what she said. 
MICK So, she just opened the door at ten o'clock to a stranger? 
OFFICER MAXWELL She didn't put it like that... 
MICK Was there blood on his right hand? 
OFFICER MAXWELL (confused by the shift) No, his left. Or we would have bagged his right one, too. 
INT. CAMERA TRAILS THE JURY... 
As a new witness is on the stand, Ted's witness... 
TED Mr. Talbot, you were with Miss Campo on the night of March Sixth? CHARLES TALBOT, 48, the customer from the video. Blurred tattoos on muscled forearms, dyed blonde hair. 
TALBOT Yep. Had a date with her at Morgan's. Then from there we went to her place and had another date, if you know what I mean. 
B5. Air of a sleaze-ball sex-player, but calm and good-humored. 
TED Had you known Miss Campo before? 
TALBOT Nope. Just called her up. 
TED How did you know to call her? 
TALBOT From her website. She's got a real good website. Jury laughs a little. Fascinated but repulsed by this guy... but Fullbright stirs, disliking Talbot's tone... 
TED Did you have sexual relations? 
TALBOT Four hundred bucks worth. And she earned every cent. Angle a male JUROR, red-faced with disapproval. Mick catches his reaction, likes it. Ted goes on... 
TED And what time did you leave? 
TALBOT About five minutes before ten. 
TED She say she had another engagement? 
MICK I know. My father represented him. He got him off for using it in self- defense, so Cohen made him a present of it. Sobel, careful, opens it... It's empty. Like Mick said. 
SOBEL Why didn't you report it stolen? 
MICK Because I knew who took it. (They look at him.) A client. He told me, so I couldn't turn him in without breaking a trust. They do that. 
LANKFORD (doesn't buy this) Still and all, mind if I look around? Just in case you haven't had time to toss it off a pier? 
MICK Go crazy. You've got the warrant. Lankford sneers, starts for the next room. To Sobel-- 
LANKFORD Heidi-- bag the box. He leaves. As she bags it-- He wonders why. 
MICK You can't do ballistics on a box. She glances, seeing Lankford's gone-- explains. 
SOBEL That old Mickey Cohen shooting? It's kind of famous. It turns out the county still has the evidence in storage. The bullet. 
MICK You can match casings to a slug that's fifty years old? 
SOBEL It'd be easier with the gun, but yeah. She goes to join her partner. Mick stops her with-- 
MICK Detective? How long will ballistics take? 
SOBEL Careful. You'll make me think you're worried what we'll find. 
MICK I'm in the middle of a trial. 
SOBEL A day. Maybe forty-eight hours. She leaves. Mick's gaze, in the mirror: Fear. 
INT. COURTROOM - NEXT MORNING - ARRIVING... 
Mick and Ted, at the same time. As they move to the front... 
TED Morning, Haller. Word is, you had interesting visitors last night... 
MICK Worry about yourself, Ted. You're dying the death of a thousand razors up there and you don't even know it. They peel off-- Mick to the defense table, where Louis waits for him. Before Louis can speak: Low-- 
MICK (CONT'D) Listen, you little shit: This gun- scheme of yours is about to blow up, and I'm not going down for it. If I have to drive people to the airport the rest of my life. Mick is seething. Louis smiles. Unruffled. 
INT. COURTROOM, LATER - TED RISES... 
TED One last witness, your honor. The prosecution calls Regina Campo. 
INT. COURTROOM, LATER - REGGIE ON THE STAND... 
Diminutive, conservative dress, dark curls around her pretty face-- none of the aggressive sexiness. Hesitant but frank. 
REGGIE It's true that I lied. I knew him when he came to the door. 
TED In fact, you'd arranged his coming Miss Campo: why did you lie? 
REGGIE I was scared. I wasn't sure the police would believe me and I wanted to make sure they arrested him... because he's an animal... She looks tentatively at Louis, as if still scared-- then she looks away. Louis is blank. Mick takes it in. Ted follows up-- 
TED Do you regret that decision now? 
REGGIE Yes. If it helps him to get free and do this to somebody else. 
MICK Your honor, prejudicial-- 
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT Sustained. But ANGLE THE JURY: the damage is done. Reggie's moved them. 
TED I have no further questions for Regina, your honor. Ted sits. 
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT Your witness, Mr. Haller. Mick about to rise when-- Louis grabs his hand. Low-voiced---- 
LOUIS I want to remind you of your words. You were going to tear her apart and throw her entrails into the sea. 
MICK That's it, keep acting like you pull the strings. 
LOUIS I do. 
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT Mr. Haller. Emphatic. Mick frees his hand, straightens himself. watched by Louis. Then all at once, to surprise her-- 
MICK Ms. Campo have you engaged an attorney to sue Mr. Roulet for the events of March Sixth? 
REGGIE (recovers, No I haven't. 
MICK But have you talked to an attorney? 
The BAR TAPE, blown-up projection, SHOWS REGGIE PASSES LOUIS 
SITTING AT THE BAR, LEANS HER BODY INTO HIM SEXILY... ANGLE COURTROOM, ON REGGIE watching the tape. Also JURORS, reacting, enthralled, and Mick watching them... 
RESUME ANGLE SCREEN, REGGIE HANDS LOUIS A NAPKIN, PASSES BY. RESUME COURT, Mick signals the TECHNICIAN. It goes OFF. 
MICK What did the napkin say, Ms. Campo? 
REGGIE My name and address... 
MICK And your price? 
REGGIE Yes. Four hundred dollars. 
MICK (after a beat) It's a hard line of work... 
REGGIE And dangerous. 
MICK In fact, haven't you told friends you were looking for a way out? 
REGGIE Yes. I'm not proud of what I do-- 
MICK And so, isn't it true-- nothing would be easier to understand-- that you saw Louis Roulet and his money as a way out? 
REGGIE No! That's not what this is about! That man hit me and tried to kill me. 
MICK Yes, we've heard you say that-- 
(TO FULLBRIGHT) Judge may I ask the witness to stand up? 
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT (surprised, but) The witness will stand. I hope you're going somewhere with this, Mr. Haller. Reggie stands. 
MICK Now if you please, walk over to my client. She goes, stands before Louis. Who rises on cue from Mick. 
MICK (CONT'D) This is the man you broke free from, overpowered, knocked out? 
REGGIE Yes-- You can do amazing things when you're afraid-- 
MICK How much do you weigh, Ms. Campo? Because your website REGGIE-FOR-FUN- DOT-COM says one hundred three... 
REGGIE That's right. A beat. Louis sits. Reggie stands there... suddenly cries. 
MICK I've got no further questions for the witness, your honor. Reggie returns to a seat behind the prosecutor's table. Where we pick up TED MINTON. Staring at Mick, hiding the sense of damage as best he can... He's startled when: 
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT Mr. Minton? Do you have another witness for us? Ted rouses, summons confidence, rises... WHILE, ASIDE, Louis to Mick, re Ted... 
LOUIS He looks worried. Mick watching Ted, waits, tense... 
TED The state rests, your honor. Mick's disappointed: No Corliss. 
MICK Not worried enough. 
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT (raises a gavel...) Then the defense will call its first witness after lunch. And the gavel comes down. 
INT. COURTROOM, AFTER THE BREAK - MICK, ON DIRECT, HAS... 
MARY WINDSOR Yes, I recognize this knife. (holding an evidence bag) It's the one my son carried with him for protection for the last four years. Almost exactly. 
MICK Why would he need protection? 
MARY WINDSOR Because realtors alone in a house are sometimes robbed or hurt... Even raped or murdered. 
MICK But has Louis ever been the subject of such a crime? 
MARY WINDSOR No. But he knew someone who... (hesitates...) 
MICK Go on, please. 
MARY WINDSOR She was raped and robbed by a man. Louis found her. It was terrible. The first thing he did afterwards was get himself a knife to carry, at all times. (looks at Ted Minton) March Sixth would have been no different. 
INT. COURTROOM, LATER - TED HAS MARY WINDSOR ON CROSS... 
TED Mrs. Windsor, you seemed pretty exact, about when your son started carrying around this, this weapon, a five-inch folding knife... 
MARY WINDSOR I am. The incident took place on June ninth, two-thousand-one. Mick watches Ted, carefully... Cat and mouse... 
TED Was it in the newspapers? 
MICK Yes you did. 
LORNA Yes I did. Just then, approaching, he sees SOBEL & LANKFORD: Are they coming for him? No, they turn into the courtroom along with others showing up for the trial's last day. Relieved-- 
MICK Now go, and be ready for my call. Lorna starts to go-- then pauses. 
LORNA I'm crazy about the power suit. Extra flip to her hips as she goes because Mick's watching. 
INT. COURTROOM - CONTINUOUS 
No sooner enters than KURLEN's in his face, waves a document. 
KURLEN What shit is this, Haller? I got nothing to do with your case! Mick, "innocent," inspects the papers. With surprise-- 
MICK Subpoena to appear as a witness? You'll just have to wait and see. It's a legal document, Detective. Cursing, Kurlen takes himself off to a corner. Leaving Mick with the "legal document." He tucks it away-- And continues to the front-- Past CECIL DOBBS and MARY WINDSOR, to LOUIS, at the defense table. OVER WHICH, PRE-LAP: 
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT (V.0.) Mr. Minton-- 
INT. COURTROOM, MINUTES LATER - COURT'S IN SESSION... 
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT Does the state have any rebuttal? 
TED (rises, ready) The state calls Dwayne Jeffrey Corliss as rebuttal witness. 
MICK Judge? Who is this witness? Why wasn't I told before now? 
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT A fair question. Mr. Minton? 
TED Dwayne Corliss is a cooperating witness who spoke with Mr. Roulet in custody, following his arrest. 
LOUIS (shouts, suddenly--) Bullshit! I didn't to talk to-- 
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT Quiet, Mr. Roulet! Mr. Haller, control your client! Mick bends over, to Louis, sotto voce-- 
MICK That was good. Now leave it to me. (to the court) I do share my client's outrage, your honor. I'd at least like to know how long the state has been sitting on this testimony... 
TED Mr. Corliss did not come forward until yesterday. 
MICK 
(OUTRAGED) This is incredible... 
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT Do you want to go back and talk to him? Given the timing I'd allow it. 
MICK No, Judge, we all know what this is, this is a jailhouse snitch, and anything he'd say would be a lie-- 
TED That's groundless, your honor-- 
MICK --I just want my objection noted. 
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT Then I'm going to rule he can 
TESTIFY-- 
MICK Can I ask one indulgence? Can I step into the hallway and make a call to an investigator? For whatever good it will do at this late date. 
INT. COURTHOUSE - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THE COURTROOM 
Mick already dialling-- Lorna answering-- 
LORNA'S VOICE Yep, here. 
MICK Put your watch at quarter of. At ten fifteen you enter the room. 
LORNA'S VOICE Got it. 
MICK With the printouts. 
LORNA'S VOICE Mickey, I know the moves! He snaps shut his cell-phone. 
INT. COURTROOM, MINUTES LATER - DWAYNE CORLISS ON THE STAND 
Prison jumpsuit. We recognize him: the holding-cell junky. 
TED Mr. Corliss, are you incarcerated at this time? 
CORLISS Um, no, now I'm just in the courtroom. Dumb answer draws laughs. ANGLE LOUIS, seething... 
TED You said he was bragging. How? 
CORLISS Well, like, he told me the details. About the other one, that he killed. 
(MORE) 
CORLISS (CONT'D) He called her a snake dancer. She danced in some joint where she was like in a snake pit. ANGLE, REACTION DETECTIVE KURLEN, he leans forward at this... SAME TIME, REACTION at the defense table: Mick, "alarmed," low to Louis-- 
MICK How does he know this? 
LOUIS Do you think I know? 
MICK If you didn't tell him this shit somebody did. Who? Start thinking! RESUME Ted, moving closer to Corliss-- 
TED Is there anything else he told you? 
CORLISS No, that snake-girl stuff was it. 
TED (after a beat) Then no further questions, your honor. Ted sits. The look he gives Mick in passing is one of abounding confidence. Mick stews... Swivels around... Covert glance, MICK'S POV, looks to see if Kurlen is where he was, against the wall. He's not. He's gone. So is Lankford. And the courtroom door still swings slightly, as if they've just left... While IN FRONT: 
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT Any re-cross from the defense? Mick rises to answer, hesitates-- and just then turns to see Lorna enter and approach down the aisle. 
MICK A moment with my staff, Judge? 
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT Be quick. He meets Lorna at the gate. Brings his head close to hers-- 
LORNA This is where I whisper in your ear, tell you stuff... 
MICK (takes a file from her) It's all here, right? You go now, I don't want anyone talking to you. 
LORNA Damn. She goes, he returns to the table. Before Louis can speak: 
MICK I don't know what's going on here, but it won't matter if it's two murders or a hundred if I can show he's a liar-- 
LOUIS If you set me up I swear I'll-- 
MICK Just tell me if there's anything else he knows. Anything else I have to stay away from. 
LOUIS I don't know because I never talked to him. I'm not that stupid. 
MICK It doesn't matter. If I destroy him none of it counts... 
LOUIS (from his gut) Then destroy him. A command. Mick nods. Returns to the witness Corliss-- 
MICK Dwayne, if I can call you that-- 
CORLISS It's what people call me-- 
MICK Don't they also call you D.J.? For example, down in Phoenix, right? 
CORLISS Maybe. He's a bit wary. Mick looks through the file Lorna brought-- 
MICK Because you know, my assistant, she was just reading on the internet about D.J. Corliss-- arrested in Phoenix, 1989 on drug charges-- Hometown of Mesa, Arizona? 
CORLISS Yeah, that'd be me. But-- 
MICK You remember Fred Bentley, right? Corliss, darkens, stumbles at this-- Ted's quick-- 
TED I object, your honor, where is the defense going with this? 
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT Connect the dots soon, Mr. Haller. But the witness can answer. 
CORLISS I don't remember any Bentley-- 
MICK Sure you do. You testified that he confessed to you the crime he was charged with-- rape of a ten-year- old girl-- even though he denied his guilt in court. Am .I ringing any bells, D.J.? 
CORLISS Uh-- 1989, I was high a lot, there's not much I recall-- 
MICK Then I'd like you to read this to us, D.J. It's a printout of a news story from the Arizona Star, 1997, that's eight years after he was convicted. I ask that it be admitted into evidence-- 
TED Your honor? A news report? 
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT Let's see where it takes us. The state can object later. Mick hands printout to the bailiff, who gives it to Corliss. 
MICK I've marked the paragraph. 
CORLISS I ain't too good at reading... (clears his throat) "A man, Frederick Bentley, wrongly convicted of rape, was released Saturday after con-- 
.tearful at the news, grips Mick's hand... she and Dobbs... 
MARY WINDSOR Mr. Haller, thank you for my son... 
DOBBS You were splendid-- And Louis. Private, a few feet away. Smiles... 
LOUIS I knew I wasn't wrong about you... 
MICK I want the gun. 
LOUIS Of course you do. No more can be said, because Mrs. Windsor-- descends on Mick-- 
MARY WINDSOR Mr. Haller, this time I insist you come to Orso for a celebration-- 
MICK I don't think so. Mary would insist, but before she can, OUT OF THE ELEVATOR comes KURLEN-- with LANKFORD AND SOBEL. Mick freezes, expects the worst-- but they move AROUND him and CLOSE IN ON: 
KURLEN Louis Roulet, you are under arrest. Turn around and place your hands behind your back. 
LOUIS (as Kurlen cuffs him) Mick? This shouldn't be happening. Mrs. Windsor rushes Kurlen-- Sobel tries forcing her back-- 
MARY WINDSOR No! Take your hands off my son! 
LOUIS Mother. Louis' voice controls her. Stricken, Mary gives up. Then-- 
DOBBS What are you arresting him for? 
KURLEN (starting to take Louis) Suspicion of murder. The murder of Martha Renteria. 
DOBBS That snake-dancer nonsense? Are you crazy? Everything that man Corliss said was a lie! Which stops Kurlen. He grins, confirmed. 
KURLEN If it was all lies, how'd you know I meant the snake dancer? Dobbs sees his mistake. Kurlen begins again to take Louis-- 
MICK A moment with my client, Detective? Kurlen nods, why not. Mick leads Louis a few steps away. 
MICK (CONT'D) This is it, Louis. I got you off. Now get yourself a new lawyer. 
LOUIS You're forgetting I have the gun... 
MICK Yeah, and you'll have to explain how you got it. But you know what? I've stopped giving a shit. You're going down, and Martinez is getting out, and that's all I care about. 
(MORE) 
MICK (CONT'D) When they stick that needle in your arm, that will be me. 
LOUIS And what if I don't go down? But Mick's finished, ready to leave, though Louis persists... 
LOUIS (CONT'D) Because I don't think they have enough to hold me. I could be out by tomorrow... You've got women, you've got a daughter... At this, Mick's head snaps to him, angrily... 
LOUIS (CONT'D) You can't protect everybody. Kurlen arrives, takes Louis's elbow... Mick's already moving to the elevators... watched by SOBEL. 
EXT. COURTHOUSE - STEPS - MINUTES LATER - DAY - STILL RAINING 
SOBEL catches up as MICK reaches the Lincoln. Stops him. They move to beneath an overhang, where they're almost dry. 
MICK Please tell me you've got enough on Louis for the murder of Renteria. 
SOBEL We will. We have the ticket. 
MICK What ticket? 
SOBEL The parking ticket, that Raul found. That was the phone message he left you... (Sees Mick doesn't know) Raul checked. Louis got one at a meter outside the victim's place, same time she was murdered. 
MICK What about Raul's murder? Do you have him for that? 
SOBEL No. We still don't know how he could have slipped the tracer anklet. (before Mick can ask more) Haller? Leave it alone. He hesitates-- but goes. Into the rain. Gets into-- 
INT. LINCOLN (PARKED) - CONTINUOUS 
He watches Sobel hurry back to courthouse through rain. When: 
EARL Mr. Haller? Got that thing you asked for. And he hands Mick something wrapped in a towel: A GUN. Mick, puts it away, in the armrest. A bit regretful, because: 
MICK I said I'd never do this. Ask you to violate your parole. 
EARL It's called, lookin' out for your blood. Mick sits back. Earl pops in a RAP CD, TUPAC. 
TUPAC "To be a man in this wicked land..." 
VAL He's movin'... on Sunset... 
MICK Is he coming to my house? 
VAL 
(STUDIES) Could be, yeah, he's going west, heading up Laurel Canyon... Mick, nods... glance toward his gun... Then... PHONE BEEPS in his ear, Call Waiting-- 
MICK Stay there, Val-- (switch/into phone) Maggie? 
MAGGIE'S VOICE I reached the sitter, she'll keep Hayley at the bus-stop... 
MICK Good. As soon as you've got her, take her somewhere safe. And call me. (shifts calls/to Val--) Where is he, Val? 
VAL I see him but I don't know where he's goin'... 
MICK What? 
VAL He's not goin' to your house. Sonofabitch sailed right past the turn... SCREEN, CURSOR travelling... 
MICK So where's he going? 
VAL He's heading for the Valley. 
MICK Fuck, he's going to Maggie's. Keep track of him. Hangs up again. Looks around-- as if looking for an idea-- then, frantic, looks up a number-- can't find it, finds it-- dials-- it rings-- Cold sweat til somebody answers-- 
MICK (CONT'D) Eddie? Eddie Vogel? It's Mick Haller... 
EXT. BAR, NIGHT, MOMENTS LATER - GLARE OF NEON IN THE RAIN... 
As the "ROAD SAINTS"-- EDDIE, HARD-CASE, others-- pour out of the bar, jump on their HARLEYS... ROAR OFF... inside which the RINGING OF A PHONE brings us BACK TO-- 
INT. MICK IN HIS KITCHEN - ANXIOUS, ANSWERS... 
MICK Yes? 
VAL'S VOICE Mick, it's me... 
INT. VAL IN HIS OFFICE... STARING AT THE SCREEN... 
VAL Where's Maggie live? What street? 
MICK 
DICKENS1 
VAL He's almost there, Mick. 
EXT. ROAD OVER THE CANYON - LOUIS ROULET'S PORSCHE... 
Descending on the valley side... 
EXT. STREET, VALLEY - THE ROAD ANGELS (MOVING)... 
Harleys pouring it on in formation, like fighter-jets... 
EXT. VENTURA BOULEVARD - RAIN - MAGGIE'S CAR... 
She screeches to the curb, hops out... School bus stop, where other parents wait, in cars, under umbrellas... Maggie rushes forward, scans for the approaching bus... Nowhere in sight... 
CUT TO, INT. KITCHEN - MICK 
He's holding a phone, squeezing it, LISTENING TO A RING AT THE OTHER END... To himself, a prayer... 
MICK Maggie be there, Maggie pick up... 
EXT. VENTURA BOULEVARD - MAGGIE 
Stands there, with the SITTER... SEES the bus approaching... 
INT. HER CAR-- 
Her CELL-PHONE left on its dashboard rack, ringing... 
INT. KITCHEN - MICK 
Frantic for her to answer...

ALISON No personal questions. Don't ask her about her sister and her nose job. 
RYAN SEACREST No plastic surgery questions. 
ALISON She doesn't want to talk about her boobs or her father's comments about her boobs. 
RYAN SEACREST Great. We'll talk about the Middle East and maybe an idea of an exit strategy. Maybe she has a good pitch. Should I ask her about Korea? Maybe have her point it out to us on a globe? I don't understand the young talent in this town! It doesn't make any sense. I got four jobs. Hell, I'm more famous than half the people we talk to anyway! No one stands up. No one has the balls to sit them down and say, "Look, just cut the shit."But everybody works for `em. They're all on the payroll. They're all sucking the teat! Nobody sits `em down, eye-to- eye, one-on-one, and says... "Cut the shit." And all these stars just to fuck it up. That's what they do. They fuck my day up! And it pisses me off! And now I'm sweating. 
ALISON You know what? You want us to just come and get you when she gets here? You want to head to the green room for a minute? Just chill out? 
RYAN SEACREST That's a good idea.

ALISON You were talking about me? 
JACK We were wondering aloud to one another whether or not you would be good for on-camera. 
ALISON What'd you decide?

ALISON Absolutely. I'm so excited. Oh, my God. 
JILL It's a lot of work. Can't wait to see what happens. It's going to be tough. Tough job. 
JACK About the work, most immediately, there's going to be some things that you're going to be able to get that other people in the office don't get. One of them: Gym membership. 
ALISON You want me to lose weight? 
JACK I don't want you to lose weight. 
JILL We can't legally ask you to do that. 
JACK We didn't say lose weight. 
JILL No. 
JACK I might say "tighten." 
ALISON "Tight." 
JACK A little...tighter? 
JILL Just like toned and smaller. 
JACK Don't make everything smaller. I don't want to generalize that way. Tighter. 
JILL We don't want you to lose weight. We just want you to be healthy. 
KNOCKED UP - 10. 
ALISON Okay. 
JILL You know, by, by eating less. We would just like it if you...go home and step on the scale and write down how much you weigh and subtract it by, like, twenty. 
ALISON Twenty. 
JILL And then weigh that much. 
JACK Just remember, you've got it here, you've got it here, and everybody's going see you right there.

PETE (back as Pete) Isn't it weird, though, when you have a kid and all your dreams and hopes go right out the window. 
DEBBIE What changed for you? What went out the window? You do everything exactly the same. 
PETE No, I love what I'm doing. But say before you're married with children you want to live in India for a year. You can do it. 
DEBBIE You want to go to India? Go to India! Seriously. 
PETE Do you want to go to India? 
DEBBIE No. You can go. 
BEN I get what he means. Honestly, when I found out about... Ben motions towards Alison. 
BEN (CONT'D) ...I had this flash of me in a white Ford Bronco hauling ass for Canada. The chopper's taping it, and I bust through the border and I'm free! I kept thinking that. Alison stares at Ben. 
BEN (CONT'D) It was a flash! 
ALISON What do you mean? 
BEN Don't look at me. We can talk about our fears here. If Doc Brown screeched up to you in the DeLorean and said, "Alison, I got the car here. What do you want to do?" No part of you would think, "Maybe I'll go back to that night and put a condom on Ben's dick?" You never got that flash? 
ALISON No. What are you talking about? 
PETE "Where we're going, we don't need roads." 
KNOCKED UP - 77. 
BEN You wouldn't do that? 
ALISON I don't know who Doc Brown is. What are you talking about? 
BEN Doc Brown is Christopher Lloyd. He invented the DeLorean time machine. 
PETE Everyone has a time machine image. 
DEBBIE I have a really good idea. Why don't you two get in your time machine, go back in time and fuck each other? 
PETE Who needs a time machine? Ben holds up his drink. 
BEN This is my time machine! 
PETE 
(TO BEN) I'll throw you in my DeLorean and gun it to 88. 
BEN 
(TO PETE) You are a funny motherfucker, man. 
(TO DEBBIE) How can you fight with him? I just want to kiss his face. He's cute. 
PETE 
(TO BEN) I like the way you move. 
BEN This is fun! We should do this more. This is the most fun I've had in a really long time.

ALISON The doctor and Debbie said it's fine. Come on! Ben stops. 
BEN I'm sorry, can we change positions? I'm going to crush the baby. 
ALISON That's ridiculous! 
BEN No, it's not. It has no shell. 
ALISON Millions of people have sex when they're pregnant! It just works! 
BEN I weigh over 200 pounds. 
ALISON Just get over it. 
BEN I can't do it. Can you just get on top? All I can see if our baby, poked in the face by my penis. 
ALISON Trust me, you're not even close. Okay, fine. Alison moves on top. Alison abruptly stops. 
ALISON (CONT'D) I can't do this. I can't focus like this. I look disgusting from this angle. I can feel you looking at my chins. 
BEN You look beautiful. Your chin looks so skinny. 
KNOCKED UP - 79. 
ALISON And my boobs are all like, squishy and they're flopping around. I can feel it and it's distracting. It's all National Geographic. 
BEN 
(WHISPERING) Do you want to do it doggie style? 
ALISON No. I do not want you to fuck me like a dog. 
BEN I'm not fucking you like a dog. It's doggie style. It's just the style. I'm, it's not like a dog. We don't have to go outside or anything. Ben and Alison lie down side by side, Ben is behind.

BEN You know it's times like this I'm glad I don't own nice things. It's a big mess, but there's only like fifty bucks worth of shit here. That's kind of the good thing. You know, my dad told me, "Don't move to Northridge." But you figure, what are the chances of that happening twice, you know? Alison picks up a huge sword. 
ALISON What is this? 
BEN It's a ninja weapon. I hope this place doesn't get condemned. That would suck. Alison finds a shopping bag with the baby books they bought. None of them have been read. Alison sadly puts them back without Ben noticing.

KNOCKED UP - 84.

ALISON Yeah. Well, she saw one of his e-mails and there's an address. Ugh. 
BEN Oh, man. I don't want to do that. 
ALISON Ben, come on. 
BEN He's not cheating on her. 
ALISON How do you know? 
BEN I just know. 
ALISON Are you sure? 
BEN I'm one hundred percent sure he's not cheating. 
ALISON Are you really? 
BEN No. It actually kind of makes sense that he would cheat. 
ALISON Why? 
BEN Because Debbie's a pain in the ass and Pete's awesome? 
ALISON Well, why don't you just come over then, and, we'll just diffuse the situation a little? 
INT. DEBBIE AND PETE'S HOUSE, DINING ROOM - NIGHT 
Alison, Ben, Pete and Debbie have dinner. 
PETE I'm just saying the music industry is different now. Steely Dan would never even have a chance.

KNOCKED UP - 85. 
BEN They really aren't good, man. 
PETE Old Steely Dan. 
BEN If I ever listen to Steely Dan, I want you to slice my head off with an Al Jarreau LP. 
PETE I should get going. I'm supposed to see this band tonight in Hollywood. Actually, they're playing in Laurel Canyon, so I'll call you because the reception's terrible over there. 
BEN That's true. 
PETE And I don't want you to worry. I'm just going to jump in the shower. It would be terrible if I smelled worse than the band.

BEN Looks like no one's home. 
DEBBIE Why was the door unlocked? Wait here. 
KNOCKED UP - 86. 
BEN I just feel bad for Pete. 
ALISON What? 
BEN I feel like this isn't a good way to get caught cheating, it shouldn't be like this. 
ALISON Well, maybe he should have thought of that before he was cheating. 
BEN (through a fake cough) Pete! 
DEBBIE I need time for myself. I want time for myself, too. Debbie holds back tears. 
DEBBIE (CONT'D) You're not the only one. 
PETE It's not that big of a deal. 
DEBBIE 
(THROUGH TEARS) I like Spiderman. 
PETE Okay, so let's see "Spiderman Three" next week. 
DEBBIE I don't want to go see it now. 
PETE Well... 
DEBBIE I don't want to have to ask you to ask me. I want you to just come up with it on your own. 
PETE What? I don't even know what to say. Uh, what do you want me to do? 
KNOCKED UP - 90. 
DEBBIE You just think because you don't yell that you're not mean, but this is mean. 
PETE I'm not being mean. I'm being honest. You're telling me I need to be honest. 
JUST-- 
DEBBIE No, you're not. You're lying. 
PETE I'm doing it because I need to keep my sanity a little bit.

PETE Come on. Debbie heads for the car. 
BEN Oh, shit, she's coming back. 
I/E ALISON CAR - DAY Alison drives to the gynecologist with Ben. 
BEN How come we go to the gynecologist so often? I bet we have to go so much so we can pay for that three-hundred- thousand-dollar machine he has. 
ALISON I cannot stop thinking about what an asshole Pete is. 
BEN That's a little strong, I would say. 
ALISON Really? Because that had to be one of the most selfish things I've ever witnessed. 
BEN It's understandable. I even think it's kind of funny. 
ALISON What's funny about it? 
BEN Well, you won't laugh now, I wouldn't imagine, but you know, the situation.

KNOCKED UP - 91. 
BEN (CONT'D) We break into this stranger's house thinking we're going to find him sleeping with a woman, and then it's a bunch of nerds playing fantasy baseball.If you saw that on television, you would laugh. 
ALISON Is that what you think? 
BEN Yeah. 
ALISON Is that what you want to do, Ben? 
BEN I don't even like baseball. I'm just saying when you're a guy and you have a family and you have responsibility, you lose that male camaraderie, and I get that. I totally understand where he's coming from. 
ALISON Why do you guys always go to that place? You miss male camaraderie. What do I give a shit? Go hang out with your bearded freak friends. I don't care. You want to hang out with guys that look like the Shoe Bomber, it's all on you, man. 
BEN Well what the fuck am I supposed to say to that? 
ALISON You should just support me! You know, you should just support everything I say because at this juncture in my life, I'm allowed to be wrong! 
BEN So if you're wrong, I have to support it? 
ALISON Yes! 
BEN I can't tell you that you're acting like a lunatic? 
ALISON Oh, that's helpful. You have to do nothing! 
BEN I've sacrificed a lot of shit to this! 
ALISON You are just fucking sitting there! You haven't sacrificed anything! 
KNOCKED UP - 92.

ALISON I've had to sacrifice my job, my body, my youth, my vagina! 
BEN You've sacrificed your vagina? 
ALISON Yes! It will never look the same after this! 
BEN Well. Fine. I'll pay for vaginal reconstructive surgery. 
ALISON You can't pay for shit! You can barely buy spaghetti. 
BEN You're right. Fine! 
ALISON You know what? Get out of the car. 
BEN Oh! You know what? Why don't you not threaten me?! 
ALISON You should just get out of the fucking car. 
BEN I'm not going to get out of the car in the middle of nowhere! No!

JAY Hey, Ben. 
BEN Yo. 
JAY How's it going? I farted on Jason's pillow as a practical joke. He farted on Jonah's, thinking it was mine. And then eventually pink-eyes my pillow. I'm not proud of this. But, I think we've all forgiven each other. But, we can't go anywhere. 
PETE You can get pink eye from farting in a pillow? 
JONAH Totally. 
PETE That's awesome. 
JONAH Yeah, but you got to be bare-assed. Martin enters the doorway, his eyes are the worst. 
BEN Jesus. Martin got it bad! What, did someone take a dump right in your eye? 
MARTIN No. No pink eye for me. I'm just really...high.

PETE Yep. It's like I can't come here with Debbie. She doesn't understand. It's like she wants to hold me in, and she was telling Alison she could train you. 
BEN She thinks she could train me? 
PETE Yeah, like you're running the Triple Crown. 
BEN She can't train this! I'm like Siegfried and Roy's Bengal. You think I'm trained. I'll bite your fucking face off. 
PETE That's right. 
BEN In front of a crowd, baby. 
PETE This is better. Besides I don't know if I have enough of these babies to go around. Pete brandishes a bag of mushrooms.

DOORMAN It is what it is, sweetie. Now can you step to the back, please? 
ALISON 
PETE Oh, wow!

PETE Why didn't you read the baby books? 
KNOCKED UP - 105.

PETE (CONT'D) Oh, man! 
BEN Think they'll take us back? 
PETE Yes. But I don't know why. Do you ever wonder how somebody could even like you? 
BEN All the time, man. Like every day. I wonder how you like me. 
PETE How can Debbie like me? She likes me. I mean, she loves me. The biggest problem in our marriage is that she wants me around. She loves me so much that she wants me around all the time. That's our biggest problem. And I can't even accept that? Uh, like that upsets me?! Ben sits up from the bed. 
BEN What? 
PETE She's the one. She loves me. 
BEN You can't believe...that people love you? I love you, man! Debbie loves you! 
PETE I don't think I can accept her love. There's something wrong with me. 
BEN You can't accept love? 
PETE I don't know what it is. 
BEN Love? The most beautiful, shiny, warmy thing in the world? You can't accept it? 
PETE I have to go to this other chair.

BEN You can't accept pure love? You can't accept Debbie? She's chosen to give you her life. She's picked you as her life partner! But you play fantasy baseball because you can't accept her love? Ben BURPS. 
BEN (CONT'D) Ugh. I could accept it, man. And Debbie's amazing, man. She's cool and she's funny and she smells good and she's nice and her hair always looks different. She's too good for you, man. Pete shoves his hand in his mouth. 
PETE Tastes like a rainbow. 
BEN You're disgusting. You're an urchin. And she busts your balls because you're a little bitch! You're a filthy bitch! And I'd bust your balls! Debbie wants to give her life to you and Alison doesn't want to do that with me. And it makes me sad all day. I want to go home.

BEN Because you were the only one giving me advice! And it was, it was terrible advice! 
HARRIS (O.S.) You can go around blaming everyone else, but in the end, until you take responsibility for yourself, none of this is going to work out.

BEN 
(WHISPERING) Okay. Okay. Let's relax. Do you want to talk about things? I feel really bad about a lot of the shit I did. I can't believe I said some of that. That's all I think about in my head.

DR. KUNI Hello, Alison, Ben. Interesting night. 
BEN We really, really appreciate you coming, man. 
DR. KUNI What else do I have to do, I mean, besides sleep? I was only kidding. What happened to your doctor? 
BEN He's at a Bar Mitzvah in San Francisco. He didn't tell us though. 
DR. KUNI Nice. 
BEN Yeah. 
DR. KUNI Lucky for you I don't have any Jewish friends. 
ALISON Dr. Kuni, I really want to do this naturally. I don't want to use drugs. 
DR. KUNI Let's just take a look and see what happens, okay? Fetal heart rate is good. Samuel, where are we? 
KNOCKED UP - 126. 
SAMUEL Four centimeters. 
DR. KUNI Four centimeters what? 
SAMUEL Dilated. 
DR. KUNI Dilated. That's right. Focus. Pay attention, okay? We're a team. Okay? 
INT. HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM 
Jonah, Jason, Jay and Martin sit in the waiting room. 
JONAH I want to get the fuck out of here. 
JAY What? 
JONAH I just want to get the fuck out of here. 
JAY Just relax, man, just relax. 
JONAH I don't fucking like hospitals. 
JAY Jonah, this is beautiful. I just think you need to relax and embrace the beauty of another life joining our gang. We're having a baby. We are having a baby. 
JONAH I'm not having shit besides a fucking panic attack. There's probably a fucking room back there full of dead bodies! You guys want to be here when one rolls out and just fucking coughs malaria into our face? 
JAY Jesus. 
JONAH Fucking shit. 
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM 
Ben massages Alison's back. 
BEN Is that good? 
KNOCKED UP - 127. 
ALISON Oh, yeah, get in there. 
BEN I could do this all day. The fetal heart monitors begins to BEEP. 
ALISON What was that? 
BEN What the hell was that? Samuel hurries in to check the monitor. 
BEN (CONT'D) What's that, what's happening? Dr. Kuni enters. 
DR. KUNI Well, boy and girls, what seems to be the problem? 
SAMUEL Decels. 
DR. KUNI Oh, dear. Okay. Alison, I need you to turn on your back now, okay? The baby's heart rate is slowing. Okay? 
BEN It's going to be okay. (to Dr. Kuni) Is it going to be fine? Alison turns onto her back. 
DR. KUNI It's going to be fine. Okay? 
(TO ALISON) You're going to feel a little bit of a push. Dr. Kuni tries to reposition the baby. 
BEN What are you doing? 
DR. KUNI I'm turning the baby so I can take the pressure off the cord. 
ALISON Oh, my God. The monitors stops beeping. 
KNOCKED UP - 128. 
DR. KUNI We're good. The heartbeat's stronger, but we're not out of the woods. We need to get things going now. I think the cord is wrapped around the neck. Okay? 
BEN What? 
DR. KUNI So I'm going to give you some medicine, pop the bag and get things going, okay? I don't want to leave the baby in there for long and we can give you some medicine for the pain. 
ALISON No, no, no, no. I don't want the baby to be born all drugged out. It's not my birth plan. 
DR. KUNI Now, things change. We don't have time to debate this. 
Ben and Debbie talk in the hallway alone. 
BEN I'd like to be in there with Alison...without you. 
DEBBIE Okay. I understand how you feel, but this isn't up to you. 
KNOCKED UP - 132. 
BEN Look, Debbie, you are high off your ass if you think you're coming into that room. If you take one step towards that door, I will tell security there's a crazy chick in a pink dress snatching up babies. Okay? So don't even try to come into that room. That's my room now. That little area with the Pepsi machine...that's your area. My room. Your area. Stay in your area. Stay out of my room. Back the fuck off. 
INT. HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM 
Debbie sits down in a seat next to Pete. 
PETE What are you doing here? 
DEBBIE He just kicked me out. He told me to leave. But I guess it's good, right? He said he's going to take care of her. He really seems on his game. I think he's going to be a good dad. I think I like him. Thank God. 
PETE I wish I'd gotten that on tape. 
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM 
Alison is in labor. She is PANTING. 
ALISON Go! Holy shit, almighty! Oh, shit, this really hurts! 
DR. KUNI Ah, I see we're well on our way. 
ALISON I want the epidural! Okay? Give me the epidural! 
BEN Give it to her. Give her the epidural, okay? 
ALISON Okay? 
BEN Give it to her now. 
DR. KUNI Alison, we're past the point of an epidural. The cervix is fully dilated. 
KNOCKED UP - 133. 
ALISON No, seriously, I want an epidural! I know there's time! 
DR. KUNI We can't give you the epidural. 
ALISON Take the time! I'll make sure it doesn't come out! I'll stop pushing. 
BEN We have time. 
ALISON I'll stop, oh, please, please, please! 
BEN Just do it, please! 
DR. KUNI I'm sorry. We have no time. We're going to just have to do this the all natural way, okay? The way you wanted to do it. Okay? Ready? 
ALISON Okay. 
DR. KUNI Here comes another contraction, okay? I want you to push. Okay, ready? Good, good, good. 
ALISON I feel everything! Oh, my God! It's happening. 
SAMUEL Maybe we can take it down just a little. I think you're going to scare the other pregnant women. 
ALISON Are you fucking kidding me? Are you kidding me? 
INT. HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM 
Alison's SHRIEKING is heard in the waiting room. 
JAY Jesus. 
JONAH Oh. This is messed up. Something's wrong in there. 
JASON No, no. I mean, granted, gynecology's only a hobby of mine, but it sounds to me like she's crowning. Is that right, Deb? 
KNOCKED UP - 134. 
DEBBIE Yeah. That's what it sounds like for everyone. Everyone goes through this. 
JAY No, I disagree with you. That sounds terrible. I'm going to go sneak a peek, see if there's anything I can do. Jay goes to Alison's room. 
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM 
Alison is in agony. Ben, Dr. Kuni and nurses are hunched around her. 
DR. KUNI It's crowning! I'm seeing the head! 
ALISON Oh, God. Honey, what does it look like, Ben? Been peers down between Alison's legs. We actually see the crowning shot as the baby's head is being pushed out of Alison's vagina. 
BEN Oh, God. 
ALISON What? 
BEN You don't want to see it. You don't 
WANT-- 
ALISON No, I want to see it! 
BEN It's beautiful. You don't want to, though. 
ALISON No, I want to see... A nurse holds a mirror for Alison. She sees the actual crowning shot. 
ALISON (CONT'D) ...it! Oh, God! Oh, God! 
DR. KUNI Okay, we're almost home! One, two-- Jay bursts in. 
JAY You okay in here? 
KNOCKED UP - 135. 
Jay sees the crowning shot. 
JAY (CONT'D) Jesus! 
ALISON Get out! 
JAY Yeah, okay. 
INT. HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM 
Jay solemnly returns to his chair. 
JASON You all right, buddy?

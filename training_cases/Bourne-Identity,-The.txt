PARIS DRAFT 9/20/00 
DARKNESS. THE SOUND OF WIND AND SPRAY. 
MUSIC. TITLES. 
EXT. OCEAN -- NIGHT 
The darkness is actually water. A SEARCHLIGHT arcs across heavy ocean swells. Half-a-dozen flashlights -- weaker beams -- racing along what we can see is the deck of an aging FISHING TRAWLER. 
FISHERMEN struggling with a gaff -- something in the water -- 
A HUMAN CORPSE. 
EXT. FISHING BOAT DECK -- NIGHT 
THE BODY sprawled there. The Sailors all talking at once -- three languages going -- brave chatter to mask the presence of death -- 
SAILOR #1 -- Jesus, look at him -- 
SAILOR #2 -- what? -- you never saw a dead man before? -- 
SAILOR #3 -- look, look he was shot -- (nudging the body --) 
SAILOR #1 -- don't, don't do that -- 
SAILOR #2 -- he's dead, you think he cares? -- 
SAILOR #1 -- so have some respect -- it's a -- (stopping as --) 
THE BODY MOVES! -- convulsing -- coughing up sea water -- the Sailors -- freaked -- jumping back -- standing there, as -- 
THE MAN begins to breathe. 
INT. FISHING BOAT BUNK ROOM -- NIGHT 
A wreck. Too small for all the people in here right now -- SAILORS sweeping off the table -- rough hands laying THE MAN down -- 
THE CAPTAIN -- brutal and impatient -- watching from the door as -- 
GIANCARLO tears through the clutter -- searching for a medical kit buried in the shambles. GIANCARLO is sixty. A bloodshot soul. 
GIANCARLO -- it's here -- hang on -- it's here somewhere -- give me a minute -- get some blankets -- get some blankets on him -- (finding the kit --) -- here we go -- here it is -- 
GIANCARLO with an old trunk -- just getting it open, as -- 
THE CAPTAIN Giancarlo. (Giancarlo turns back --) We pick him up? Okay, we have to pick him up. But that's as far as it goes. 
GIANCARLO He needs a doctor. 
CAPTAIN Fuck that. He lives? He dies? I don't care. We've wasted two hours on this shit already. You do what you can, but we're not going back. (pure steel now) You understand me? 
GIANCARLO Yes, sir. 
CAPTAIN (to the rest of them) Let's get back to work! 
GIANCARLO watching them run out. Snagging a quick pull on a pint of rum he's got stashed and -- 
INT. FISHING BOAT BUNK ROOM -- DAWN -- TIME CUTS 
Transformed into a makeshift operating room. A light swings overhead. THE MAN layed out across the table. Sounds -- groans -- words -- snatches of them -- all in different languages. 
A ratty old espresso machine. THE MAN standing there, staring at the thing like it's a test. Then his hands begin to move -- trying to pack a grind -- trying to fit it in -- turning on the steam and -- 
The whole thing explodes. 
EXT. FISHING BOAT DECK -- DAY 
THE MAN alone doing chin-ups on the deck rail. He's still bandaged and the wounds must hurt like hell, but he's pushing himself. Using the pain -- bathing in it -- maybe even hoping that it will hold some answer for him. 
INT. FISHING BOAT GALLEY -- NIGHT 
A chess board. Wooden pieces jumbled in a box. THE MAN hesitates -- takes a black knight from the box -- lingers for a moment -- and then places it on the board. He's off and running. He knows this. Placing pieces faster and faster -- still setting it up, as we -- 
INT. FISHING BOAT HEAD -- NIGHT 
One of the ugliest bathrooms on the planet. THE MAN standing before a pitted, tarnished, cataract of a mirror. Staring at himself. 
And then he speaks. 
THE MAN (in perfect French) I don't know who I am. Do you know who I am? Do have any idea who I am? 
And then he stops. Blinks. Wipes away the perspiration just beading on his forehead. 
THE MAN (in perfect Dutch) Tell me who I am. If you know who I am, please stop fucking around and tell me. 
No answer. Just that face. His face. Who am I? 
And what else is inside there? 
EXT. FISHING BOAT -- DAY 
SAILORS hauling in the nets. THE MAN -- still bandaged, but healing -- working beside them. Earning his keep. Getting healthy. 
EXT. ITALIAN COASTLINE -- DAWN 
A small, colorful fishing village. The trawler motoring in. 
INT. THE FISHING BOAT BUNK ROOM -- SAME TIME 
THE MAN buttoning up borrowed clothes. GIANCARLO pulling some cash from his pocket -- 
GIANCARLO (offering the money) It's not much, but it should get you to Switzerland. 
THE MAN I won't forget this. 
GIANCARLO gives him a look. Shakes his head, and -- 
INT. POKEY ITALIAN TRAIN STATION -- DAY 
The ticket window. THE MAN and a TICKET AGENT. 
TICKET AGENT Una sola via? 
THE MAN Si. One way. Una sola via. 
EXT. TGV -- DAY 
A HELICOPTER SHOT -- a bullet train speeds through snow- capped Alps. We move in on a window -- and staring out is... 
INT. TGV TRAIN -- DAY 
...THE MAN. People all around him -- families -- businessmen -- normal people going about their lives. THE MAN turns back to the window, but he's not watching the scenery -- he's looking at his reflection. So lost. His face suddenly plunged into darkness as the train bombs into a tunnel... 
EXT. TRAIN -- NIGHT 
...and out of the darkness into night and the HELICOPTER SHOT, as the train races toward ZURICH. 
INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS CONFERENCE ROOM -- DAY 
A VIDEO MONITOR -- FULL FRAME -- meet WOMBOSI. He's an African ex-dictator, think Idi Amin crossed with Mobutu. He's in some sort of throne room. And he's angry. Bodyguards and a translator hovering nervously around him. What this is, is NEWS FOOTAGE -- an interview conducted by a German TV station. 
WOMBOSI (he speaks english) ...no, no, no -- the time is not right, my enemies are too strong. I'm telling you to wait for this, you understand? I'm telling you this, and I'm making a warning to all those peoples out there that think that my powers have become so weak that they can play with me as they wish. You will see -- I will tell you when the evidence is clear. Then you will have a story. My old friends will hear about themselves. (stopping, freezing on that image, and --) 
MARSHALL, a CIA bigwig has the remote control. And the floor. 
THE MAN standing there. In the silence. Two unconscious cops at his feet. Blood on his pants. What just happened? How did he do this? And there's THE GUN in his hand. And God, it just feels so natural -- checking it -- stripping it down -- holding it -- aiming it -- like this is something he's done a million times before... 
This is something he definitely knows how to do. 
And then he stops cold. Throwing down the gun. Running off into the darkness -- 
INT. TREADSTONE -- DAY 
A deep, inner office. An ops office. Operations. Unlabeled and anonymous. A backwater project center hidden deep within the Langley facility. Utilitarian. Several rooms linked like a suite. 
Small staff. SEVERAL TECHNICIANS. One or two for communications. A couple for research. People are at their posts. And it's all quiet. But they are busy. Quietly urgent. This is a place under siege. 
ZORN is the number two here. Brilliant bloodless lapdog. He's coming through the suite. Coming through quickly. Heading toward the boss's little office at the back -- 
TED CONKLIN. Ivy League Ollie North. Buttoned down. Square jaw. Everything tucked away. But there's tension in the air. Work on the desk. Cot in the corner. 
CONKLIN (looking up) What? 
ZORN Abbott wants to talk. 
CONKLIN Tell him we're busy. 
ZORN I tried. 
INT. CIA COMMISSARY -- NIGHT 
ABBOTT with coffee. CONKLIN not lingering. 
ABBOTT Storm clouds are gathering, Ted. It looks like rain and I don't have a thing to wear. 
CONKLIN I don't know what we're talking about. 
ABBOTT We're talking about Marseille. We're talking about Nykwana Wombosi. And I'm asking you if this abortion in Marseille has anything to do with Treadstone. (silence) Was this Treadstone? 
CONKLIN You're asking me a direct question? 
ABBOTT Yes. 
CONKLIN I thought you were never going to do that. 
Silence. Pressure drop. 
ABBOTT They're putting together an agency oversight committee. They're going to look through everyone's budgets. Treadstone is a rather sizable line item in my ledger. (beat) What am I going to do about that? 
CONKLIN You'd want to make that go away. You'd want to remind them that Treadstone is a training organization. That it's all theoretical. You'd want to sign off on that. 
ABBOTT And what if I couldn't do that? 
CONKLIN Then I'd have to explain Treadstone. And you'd have to explain how you let me get this far. (silence) Doesn't sound like much of a Plan-B, does it? (Abbott staring) We'll clean up the field. You clean up your budgets. 
EXT. ZURICH -- DAY 
Morning in the financial district. Upscale. Uptight. 
GEMEINSCHAFT BANK just one of many elegant fortresses on this street. Everything just now opening for business. TWO GUARDS unlocking the front door and -- 
THE MAN across the street. Tucked in the shadows. Checking for cops and trouble. Looks clear. He's walking and -- 
INT. BANK RECEPTION AREA -- DAY 
Ornate, formidable and tech at the same time. 
RECEPTIONIST Can I help you? 
THE MAN standing before her. Looking very out of place. 
THE MAN I'm here about a numbered account. 
THE RECEPTIONIST nods. Pulls a pen and bank card. 
RECEPTIONIST (instant English) If you'll just enter your account number here I'll direct you to the appropriate officer. 
THE MAN takes the pen, as we -- 
DEPOSIT GUARD I'm not sure. Must be three weeks. 
EXT. STREETS OF ZURICH -- DAY -- VARIOUS SHOTS 
BOURNE exits the bank. The red bag full to its limit. He's walking briskly now. Looking for a taxi. Nothing in sight. 
BOURNE crossing the street. Shit, there's A COP on the corner -- turn -- change pace -- make it look natural -- 
BOURNE around a corner. And it's looking good for a moment -- but only a moment -- TWO MORE COPS walking a beat -- walking this way -- turn -- cut -- cross the street -- 
BOURNE heading down a boulevard. Trying to look small. Pulse starting to race. Fighting the paranoia. Where the hell is a cab? Turning back fast as A SIREN starts bleeding in from behind him -- 
It's just an ambulance. 
BOURNE turning back. Forcing himself to focus. And fuck -- there's A METER MAID, and she's stopped writing up a ticket -- she's staring at him and -- 
BOURNE trying not to panic -- don't run -- smile -- stay small -- get to the corner -- scan the options -- but -- 
THE METER MAID -- she's watching him go and she's pulling her radio and -- 
BOURNE hitting this next corner -- banging a right -- forcing himself not to run -- glancing back and -- 
THERE'S ANOTHER COP -- but this one is jogging -- searching -- he's got his radio out and -- 
FINALLY TO -- 
BOURNE bailing on the street -- disappearing into -- 
EXT. U.S. EMBASSY COMPOUND -- DAY 
Big gates. Speed barricades. SEVERAL U.S. MARINES standing guard near a gate house. An American flag. Lots of people coming and going. BOURNE playing it as normal as possible as he heads for the entrance. 
INT. U.S. CONSULATE ZURICH -- VISA ROOM -- DAY 
The passport and visa office. Big room. No windows. Unpleasant on purpose. Two lines: A short one for U.S.  Citizens, a marathon for everyone else. CONSULATE CLERKS stationed in open cubicles along the back wall. And it's a zoo. American tourists who've lost their passports. Foreigners looking for visas. Asylum seekers. Everyone here has a problem. 
BOURNE on the U.S. line. Standing there trying to think. What's he gonna say? What can he say? With the cops outside, and the incident in the park, then the bank... 
MARIE (O.S.) -- no, this is not my current address. It was my current address two days ago when I started standing in line outside -- 
A NEARBY CUBICLE. Meet MARIE KREUTZ. German. Big energy. Real beauty hidden beneath the armor. And armor it is, because this is a warrior in full, crisis battlemode. 
MARIE -- and so now I lost my apartment, I have no address, and I have no visa, and you keep telling me how much help you cannot give me! 
A CONSULATE CLERK caught in her headlights. 
CLERK Miss Kreutz, please... I'm gonna have to ask you to keep your voice down. 
MARIE All the papers -- all the papers they asked for -- I brought all the papers -- 
CLERK Miss Kreutz, excuse me, but you entered into a fraudulent marriage in an effort to circumvent the immigration laws of the United States -- 
MARIE You only know that because I told you! (she's incredulous) Ask the case officer -- find his name -- it's on the papers -- I told him all this myself! -- (tearing through the papers now --) 
CLERK -- it's not the source of the information that's important here -- 
MARIE -- I paid this fucking guy -- I paid him four thousand dollars -- my last four thousand dollars to marry me, okay? -- I told this to the case officer last week... (she's found it --) ...here -- Mr. Thomas. I told Mr. Thomas I didn't know this guy was already married -- I admitted this! 
CLERK -- Miss Kreutz, please -- 
MARIE -- I'm the one that got ripped off! -- not you -- not the United States government -- me -- I'm the one being ripped off! 
CLERK So now you're asking for a student visa? 
That shuts her up. Yes. Today she's a student. 
INT. CIA OFFICE COMPLEX -- NIGHT (BUT SAME TIME) 
Motion -- CONKLIN racing down a staircase -- ZORN chasing after -- 
CONKLIN -- and they're sure it's him? -- 
ZORN -- he accessed the account -- 
THE SECURITY CHIEF -- freaking out -- TWO MARINES WITH HIM -- they're raising their weapons and there's people in the lobby and -- 
SECURITY CHIEF -- no -- no -- hold your fire! -- 
BOURNE -- landing hard on THE GUN MARINE -- rolling away from the gate -- into the building now -- coming up with the backpack and -- 
SOMEONE SCREAMING -- he's got a gun! -- he's got a gun! -- 
And he does -- BOURNE with the M-16! -- coming up with it -- coming up on the move -- swinging it around as he searches for an escape route and THE GUN -- it's like a magic wand of hysteria -- 
PEOPLE IN THE LOBBY -- SCREAMING -- diving away -- everyone dropping for cover and -- 
BOURNE -- bailing -- on the run -- sprinting down a hallway -- tossing away the M-16 as he sprints into the building -- 
THE SECURITY CHIEF (frantic on his radio now --) -- red! -- red! -- red! -- code red! -- South side entrance! -- male -- five- ten, brown hair -- black jacket -- red bag -- 
INT. U.S. CONSULATE OFFICE HALLWAY -- DAY 
Quiet for a second -- offices on either side of a carpeted hallway -- BUREAUCRAT-TYPES doing their thing, when suddenly -- 
BUREAUCRAT #1 Excuse me?  Can I help you? (but backing up as he says it, because --) 
Here comes BOURNE -- coming fast -- and he definitely does not belong back here -- 
INT. U.S. CONSULATE LOBBY/SECURITY GATE -- DAY 
Panic -- people fleeing the lobby -- MORE MARINES hustling in from outside and -- 
INT. U.S. CONSULATE FIRE STAIRWELL -- DAY 
Door flies open -- BOURNE bombing in -- shit! -- it's a dead end -- no way out but up the stairs -- 
INT. U.S. CONSULATE GROUND FLOOR CORRIDOR -- DAY 
SECURITY CHIEF -- THREE MARINES -- sidearms drawn -- jogging past the INNER OFFICES -- running beside them, a frantic guy in a suit -- 
DEPUTY DCM -- what're you talking about? -- 
SECURITY CHIEF -- we're evacuating the building -- 
DEPUTY DCM -- we're in the middle of a trade meeting! -- 
SECURITY CHIEF -- call the code! -- I want everyone out! -- 
DEPUTY DCM -- you gotta give me more to go on -- 
SECURITY CHIEF -- he's running from the cops, he's got a bag filled with God knows what, he's in the building and I don't know where! -- 
INT. U.S. CONSULATE BACK STAIRWAY -- DAY 
BOURNE climbing fast -- two -- three -- stairs at a time -- racing up as a SECURITY ALARM STARTS SCREAMING -- bleet -- bleet -- bleet -- 
INT. U.S. CONSULATE FIFTH-FLOOR GRAND HALLWAY -- DAY 
THE ALARM ringing everywhere -- TRADE CONFERENCEES -- sixty confused and frightened people -- spilling out into the corridor -- 
INT. U.S. CONSULATE FIFTH FLOOR KITCHENETTE -- DAY 
A NEW DOOR flying open -- it's BOURNE -- ready for anything, but there's nothing -- he's in a butler's prep area off the main conference room -- momentum stalled for a moment -- nothing in here but tablecloths and silverware and coffee cups and -- 
INT. U.S. CONSULATE BACK STAIRWAY -- DAY 
THREE MARINES -- armed and stoked -- staring up the stairs -- leapfrogging -- point-to-point assault procedure -- 
INT. U.S. CONSULATE MAIN STAIRS -- DAY 
Carpeted and grand -- SECURITY CHIEF with FIVE MARINES NOW -- charging up -- pushing past THE PEOPLE trying to come down and -- 
INT. U.S. CONSULATE FIFTH FLOOR GRAND HALLWAY -- DAY 
Completely clogged now -- PANICKED TRADE PEOPLE all over -- EMBASSY TYPES -- trying to herd them toward the main stairs -- everyone talking at once -- THAT ALARM STILL BLARING and -- 
VOICE (O.S.) -- no! -- the other way! -- take the backstairs! -- the backstairs! -- he's on the other side -- there's a bomb! -- 
THE RED BAG falls. Thump. Into the courtyard. Forget the open window. Now he's got to go all the way. 
Timing his next move and -- 
He's pushing off -- reaching -- there's another drainpipe and he's snagged it -- he's got a dragline now -- starting to fall -- straining to hold the pipe -- slowing his descent -- the drainpipe pulling away from it's housing and -- 
BOURNE letting go -- just before he falls backward -- one last grab -- catching a gutter -- holding it just long enough to slow his fall and -- 
Letting go for the last fifteen feet and -- 
EXT. U.S. CONSULATE FIFTH FLOOR GRAND HALLWAY -- DAY 
A DOZEN MARINES -- pumped-up and listening to -- 
SECURITY -- we're gonna go room by room until we find him -- so let's get teamed up -- 
EXT. AN ALLEYWAY NEAR THE U.S. CONSULATE -- DAY 
MARIE storming away. Pissed-off -- broke -- illegal -- ruined and -- 
MARIE (German) Motherfucking sonsofbitches! (a new problem --) 
A LITTLE RED CAR. A beat-to-shit Euro car. A shitty little red car angled in beside a dumpster with a big red Zurich parking ticket on the windshield. 
MARIE grabbing the ticket -- tearing it up -- tearing the shit out of it -- blind with misfortune -- throwing the pieces on the ground and stomping on them and then -- 
MARIE (looking up --) What are you looking at? 
BOURNE standing across the car -- on the passenger side -- 
BOURNE I need a ride. 
MARIE What? 
BOURNE I need a ride out of here. 
MARIE Oh, Jesus... (backing away and --) 
BOURNE Please. I don't want to scare you. 
MARIE It's a little late for that. 
BOURNE I've got a situation here and -- 
MARIE Get the fuck away from my car. 
BOURNE I'll give you ten thousand dollars to drive me to Paris. 
MARIE Great. You know what? I'll give you ten gazillion dollars to get the fuck away from me before I start screaming my head off. 
BOURNE You don't want the police any more than I do. 
BOURNE tosses cash -- a stack of hundreds -- across the car into her hands -- she catches it. Looks at it. 
MARIE Jesus... 
BOURNE Get me out of here. Please. 
MARIE looking at him. At the money. Back at him, and -- 
INT. TREADSTONE COMMUNICATIONS DESK -- NIGHT 
VIDEO PLAYBACK -- FULL FRAME -- fast forward -- a speeding blur of images from a surveillance camera outside the Zurich bank -- it's two days worth of footage -- they're scanning for Bourne's arrival and -- 
CONKLIN go -- keep going -- go...wait -- stop -- you went past it -- 
COM TECH #1 working the console. Freezing the image. Punching it up. There it is -- BOURNE leaving the bank with the red bag. 
CONKLIN (staring at the monitor) It's him. My God, it's really him... 
ZORN the phones across the room. COM TECH #2 at his console -- 
COM TECH #2 -- we got a cross-ref ready to go here, sir, we're running hotel, airline, train, and medical variables, anything else you'd like? 
BOURNE Look, I want a ride to Paris. (wide open now) That's all I want. I swear. 
MARIE You swear? (cold here) That's great. I feel so much better now. 
BOURNE I don't want anything but a ride. All I want to do is go home. 
Silence now. She looks back. Measuring him. 
MARIE You could buy a car for twenty grand. You could buy this car. 
BOURNE I don't want to go alone. I want you to drive me to Paris. Like we're a couple. Like we're a couple and we're travelling together. That's all we're doing. 
MARIE And I don't get hurt. I get twenty thousand dollars and I don't get hurt. 
BOURNE I won't hurt you. 
MARIE What if I say no? 
BOURNE Then I'll find another ride. 
EXT. ROME STREET -- DAY 
CASTEL through the streets on a motorcycle. Whipping to a stop -- stepping off the bike in front of -- 
U-STORE-IT STORAGE WAREHOUSE. 
INT. STORAGE WAREHOUSE ELEVATOR -- DAY 
CASTEL and THE ELEVATOR OPERATOR -- rising slowly through the dark warehouse and -- 
INT. CASTEL'S STORAGE UNIT -- DAY 
Darkness -- a key turning -- door opening -- light goes on to reveal CASTEL standing there and we're in -- 
CASTEL'S STORAGE UNIT. What's in here? Like nothing. Like a stack of old newspapers in the corner. Some mildewed books piled along one wall. Some shitty plastic chairs. 
QUICK TIME CUTS 
CASTEL working fast. Closing the door. Moving to the pile of books. Taking the top book off. Opening it. 
INSIDE THE BOX -- a timer. A small bomb. A booby-trap. An LED light stops flashing as CASTEL'S HANDS code in his password and -- 
CASTEL moving to the newspapers stacked in the corner. Pulling away the top pile and -- 
A METAL LOCK BOX. Hidden here. CASTLE pulling it out. Opening it. An empty tray on top and -- 
CASTEL taking off his watch. Taking off his rings. Taking out his wallet. His Spanish passport. Emptying his pockets. All of this goes into the empty tray and -- 
CASTEL lifting away this top tray -- setting it aside and -- 
THE METAL LOCK BOX -- there's more -- a much larger bottom compartment -- and it's deja-vu all over again -- we're looking at the identical contents we saw Bourne find in the Zurich safe-deposit box. 
First of all... 
MONEY. Lots of it. Ten thousand dollar stacks of hundreds. Lots of them. A GUN. A very good gun. A dozen clips of ammo. And FIVE MORE PASSPORTS. All clean. Brand new. All with his photo. Five different names. Four different countries. Each one of these pristine clipped to a piece of card stock that says: 
NAME: NATIONALITY: PLACE OF ISSUE: SIGNATURE SAMPLE: A BAR CODE: Two Italian. Two Spanish. A Portuguese. 
CASTEL going for the Portuguese passport and -- 
EXT. ALPS HELICOPTER SHOT -- DAY 
The little red car driving through The Alps. 
INT. THE RED CAR -- DUSK 
BOURNE staring out the window. MARIE driving. Long silence until -- 
MARIE Just so you know, if you're gonna burn me on the money, you might as well kill me. (Bourne looks over) I was supposed to have this car back three days ago. It's not my car. 
BOURNE I know that. 
MARIE staring at him -- glancing back to the road -- just in time -- almost rear-ending a slow moving truck -- 
EXT. PARIS STREET -- NIGHT 
A MINI-MOTORCADE driving towards Neuilly. Two security cars. A van full of kids and mothers. And one big Mercedes stretch. 
INT. THE MERCEDES STRETCH LIMO -- NIGHT 
WOMBOSI alone in the back. Looking haunted. 
INT. TRUCKSTOP CAFE -- NIGHT 
It's a weird spot. Open all night. But Euro-style. Quiet tonight. A few Alpen-truckers chowing down. A local or two at the bar and -- 
BOURNE AND MARIE at a back table. Drinking coffee. He's got the red bag open. All the passports -- the personal junk -- the money -- all the shit from the Zurich bank box -- he's been showing it to her -- 
And he's got her attention now. 
MARIE And you have no idea -- not a clue -- what came before that? 
BOURNE No. 
MARIE When you think of it, before the ship -- before you wake up on the ship, what do you see? 
BOURNE Nothing. It's just not there. 
MARIE Well, this is great. (she sits back) I'm sick of myself and you have no idea who you are. 
BOURNE I kept trying things, I thought if I could find all the things I could do, I could -- 
MARIE -- you could put it together -- 
BOURNE -- which was okay for a while, I was okay with it... (hesitating now) But then -- there's all these other things -- all these other things I know how to do -- and this -- this stuff from the bank and... (suddenly flat out --) I think something bad happened. 
MARIE What are you talking about? 
BOURNE I don't know. 
MARIE Sounds like you were in an accident or something. 
BOURNE I was shot twice in the back. 
MARIE Okay, so you're a victim. 
BOURNE There was a gun. Who has a safe deposit box with a gun and all this money and all these passports? 
MARIE Lots of people have guns. You're American. Americans love guns. 
BOURNE I fought my way out of an embassy. I climbed down a fifty-foot wall -- I went out the window and I was doing it -- I just did it. I knew how to do it. 
MARIE People do amazing things when they're scared. 
BOURNE Why do I? -- I come in here -- instinctively -- first thing I do -- I'm looking for the exit -- I'm catching the sightlines -- I know I can't sit with my back to the door -- 
MARIE You're paranoid. You were shot. It's natural. 
She's not listening. He leans in. Flat out now. 
BOURNE I can tell you the license plate numbers of all three cars out front. I can tell you that the waitress is left-handed and the guy at the counter weighs two-hundred and fifteen pounds and knows how to handle himself. I know that the best, first place to look for a gun is the cab of that grey truck outside. I know that at this altitude I can run flat out for half a mile before I lose my edge. I knew that you were my first, best option out of Zurich? How do I know all that? How can I know all that and not know who I am? How is that possible? 
Long dead pause. 
MARIE God, you're not kidding, are you? 
INT. TREADSTONE RESEARCH DESK -- DAY 
BOURNE'S FACE -- a video image frozen on A COMPUTER SCREEN -- it's Bourne looking at the camera -- Bourne looking up at the camera in the consulate passport office and -- 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL 
HALF A DOZEN COMPUTER MONITORS -- and lots of shots of Bourne -- twenty angles -- twenty different locations -- twenty candid perspectives of Bourne and his mad scramble through the consulate -- 
CONKLIN and RESEARCH TECH #1 poring over these surveillance tapes downloaded from Zurich -- 
CONKLIN And that's the best angle of the courtyard? 
MARIE I needed a break. 
BOURNE Where are we? 
MARIE We're about an hour away. 
BOURNE I can't believe I slept. 
MARIE You were tired. Here... (bread and soda --) For twenty-thousand I like to throw in breakfast. (he takes it) So what do you dream about? 
BOURNE I dream I'm asleep. I dream that I'm asleep and I can't wake up. (he takes a hit from her smoke and coughs --) I don't think I smoke. 
Another silence. She's watching him. 
MARIE You ever think maybe you have a family? 
BOURNE I thought about it. I don't know. 
She looks away. Was she hoping for another answer? 
MARIE I guess it's like Christmas every day for you, huh? 
INT. TREADSTONE CONKLIN'S OFFICE -- DAY 
MARIE'S FACE -- A PASSPORT PHOTO -- she's eighteen -- she's smiling -- really alive and fresh and -- 
CONKLIN behind his desk. ABBOTT staring grimly at the picture -- 
ABBOTT Who is she? 
ZORN Marie Helene Kreutz. She's twenty- six. Born outside Munich. Father was a welder. He died in '91. We don't have the mother. There might be a step-sister, we're trying to track that down. (apologetic) It's tough. She's a wanderer. She pops up on the grid here and there but... I mean, the last time she paid an electric bill in Europe was '94. No taxes. No steady employer. She's got three arrests. Two shoplifting cases, one in Spain, one in Germany. And she actually did three months in an Italian detention center for credit card fraud. 
ABBOTT No political affiliations? 
CONKLIN She's a gypsy. If it's a cover, it's a great one. 
ABBOTT I'm assuming we're exploring that possibility. 
CONKLIN We're exploring every possibility. (tighter by the moment) We are in pursuit. How much more do you want me to tell you? 
ABBOTT Pursuit would indicate that you know exactly where he is. 
CONKLIN No. Pursuit ends when we know exactly where he is. 
ABBOTT Yes, well, I think we need some fresh eyes on this problem. I'm bringing in some people from upstairs. 
CONKLIN hesitates. Inside he's screaming. 
CONKLIN We've been down here for two weeks banging our heads against the wall. We've been sleeping down here. We just got our first lead fourteen hours ago, and now? -- now that we finally have something to work with -- you want to bring planning personnel down here? (real steam) I'd rethink that. 
ABBOTT I want a second opinion. 
CONKLIN This is an operations desk. 
ABBOTT I'm not asking. 
EXT. PARIS STREET NEAR BOURNE'S APARTMENT -- DAY 
THE LITTLE RED CAR cruising through town. 
INT. THE LITTLE RED CAR -- DAY 
MARIE driving. BOURNE checking building numbers as they pass -- 
BOURNE Slow down. No, don't stop. Just... 
MARIE (looking over) That's it? Is that it? 
AN APARTMENT BUILDING. Big building. Elegant but cold. 
BOURNE Four-fifty. That's the address... 
MARIE Looks familiar? 
BOURNE Right. Yes. Of course. 
MANAGER/PHONE It's very bad this. Terrible sad. Such a young man. 
BOURNE Do you -- his brother -- do you have a phone number? 
MANAGER/PHONE I think not... (quick French to someone in the office there --) No, I'm sorry. It was very sudden. He was here very briefly. 
BOURNE just hands up the phone. Just like that. Not even goodbye. Standing there frozen. Stunned. John Michael Kane is dead. And he had the passport. 
Suddenly, everything's changed. They shouldn't be here. This is bad. Danger. 
THE MASTER BATHROOM 
MARIE playing with her hair in the mirror. Checking the water -- 
MARIE (calling out to him --) She wasn't kidding about the water. It's freezing. 
THE OFFICE 
BOURNE frozen there. On alert. He forces a smile. Decoy mood. 
BOURNE Hang on. I'll check the kitchen... (moving out of the office --) Maybe it takes a while to get all the way upstairs. 
THE KITCHEN 
BOURNE moving to the sink. He's smiling. Upbeat. But it's an act. His eyes are everywhere. Turning on the water. But ignoring it. What he's really doing is searching out a weapon. Pulling A KNIFE very quietly from behind the stove. Holding it. Feels pretty comfortable. Hiding it down by his side. On the move again, now -- 
BOURNE Yeah, it's cold in here, too... (calling to her as he goes --) Let's give it another minute. 
BOURNE like we've ever seen him. Like an animal. Every sound -- every breeze -- everything carries information. 
Standing still. Taking it all in. 
Real quick layout -- there's big windows along one wall that face out to the street below. The hallway to the bedroom and bath feeds into the living room from one side. There is a large frosted airshaft window along that hallway wall. Simple furniture. 
MARIE (suddenly --) -- omigod! -- (she's behind him --) -- what're you? -- no -- no -- 
MARIE backing away -- completely freaked -- BOURNE standing there with the knife in his hand and -- 
BOURNE -- no -- Marie -- no! -- it's not like that -- 
MARIE -- please -- Jason -- omigod -- 
BOURNE -- quiet -- quiet -- 
MARIE -- frightened -- confused -- paralyzed for a moment -- 
BOURNE glancing back -- a curtain fluttering behind him -- motioning for MARIE to get down -- do it -- now -- down! 
MARIE hesitating and -- 
BOURNE -- what's he doing? -- he's unscrewing a lightbulb from a lamp beside him and -- 
MARIE about to say something -- he shakes her off -- 
BOURNE -- knife in one hand -- lightbulb in the other -- putting his foot on a chair in front of him and -- 
MARIE ...what are you doing?... 
BOURNE waving her to shut up -- crawl -- now -- back up -- get under the window -- go! -- 
MARIE -- he seems so sure -- it's weird, but she's doing it -- she's under that frosted window -- down below the sill -- looking back -- what the fuck is he doing now? -- 
BOURNE -- the lightbulb -- he's tossing it across the room -- over her head -- into that frosted window and -- 
As she ducks down -- 
As it SHATTERS -- 
EVERYTHING STARTS HAPPENING AT ONCE 
PHFT!-PHFT!-PHFT!-PHFT!-PHFT!-PHFT! -- silenced automatic weapons fire -- raking into the apartment and -- 
BOURNE -- let me do this, okay? -- 
MARIE -- do what? -- what are you doing? -- he's got my picture -- (just apoplectic --) -- he's -- my God -- look at him -- he's bleeding to death -- my picture -- look! -- he was trying to kill us! -- omigod -- 
Now there's KNOCKING AT THE DOOR and -- 
THE CONCIERGE (muffled but urgent) Mister Bourne! Mister Bourne! What's going on? Is everything all right in there? (-- and she keeps banging and --) 
MARIE is past the point of rationality and CASTEL is bleeding and shaking and BOURNE is trying to think and it's just impossible and -- 
Suddenly -- CASTEL is moving! -- and fast -- it's superhuman -- unbelievable -- just enough spring in his good leg and -- 
BOURNE bracing himself but -- 
CASTEL isn't attacking! -- he's running away -- he's crossing the living room -- but there's nowhere to go -- absolutely nowhere -- except -- 
THE WINDOW 
CASTEL hurling himself into the glass and -- 
EXT. THE PARIS APARTMENT BUILDING -- DAY 
WINDOW SHATTERING! -- CASTEL -- in a cloud of broken glass -- sixty feet above the street -- 
Falling and falling and... 
IMPACT! -- landing on the roof of a parked car and -- 
INT. THE PARIS APARTMENT -- DAY 
THE APARTMENT -- BOURNE in motion -- five things at once -- checking the window -- kicking the gun away -- grabbing the red bag -- grabbing what he can -- no time to spare and -- 
THE CONCIERGE (still outside the door--) --I'm calling the police, Mr.  Bourne -- you give me no choice -- I'm calling them right away! -- 
BOURNE -- your shoes -- Marie! -- where? -- where are your shoes? -- Marie -- 
MARIE standing there in utter shock -- paralyzed -- the picture in her hand -- the broken glass -- all of what just happened -- 
MARIE He's dead isn't he? 
BOURNE Marie -- look at me -- there's no time for this -- 
MARIE He went out the window -- why? -- why would someone do that? 
BOURNE -- we can't stay here -- I can't stay here -- it's not safe here -- 
MARIE He came to kill us. 
BOURNE -- we can go -- I can get us out of here -- but we have to go now -- 
MARIE You knew he was coming. 
BOURNE No. 
MARIE I trusted you. 
BOURNE You're wrong. I didn't know. 
MARIE I don't trust anybody and I trusted you! 
BOURNE I didn't know this would happen. 
MARIE He had my picture! He knew I was here! He came here to kill us! 
BOURNE And where is he now? (that gets her quiet) You believe what you want, but I'm telling you the truth -- I never would have brought you here if I thought it was dangerous. 
MARIE (totally overwhelmed) Oh, Jesus... 
BOURNE You stay -- if you want, you stay -- it's okay -- it's better -- maybe it's better -- I don't know -- (starting to back away --) But I can't stay here. I can't. 
MARIE But the police -- 
BOURNE -- there's no time -- 
A secret studio buried deep in the Langley facility. Equipment up the ass. Five people in this darkened room: AN ENGINEER working the board. CONKLIN looking sour. ZORN in the shadows. ABBOTT sitting there waiting for analysis from -- 
MRS. DOYLE. She's late sixties. A long-time spy shrink. An eminence. A diamond-hard, seen-it-all intelligence. 
BOURNE/TAPE "Kane. John Michael Kane." 
OPERATOR/TAPE "One moment, sir." 
MRS. DOYLE nods to THE ENGINEER. She's heard enough. 
MRS. DOYLE He's not lying. He's very highly stressed, but he's not lying. He's confused. He's aggressively searching for a way out of the chaos. This conversation, the video from the consulate -- the body language, vocal pattern -- it's my sense he's really lost here. (beat) I think he snapped. 
CONKLIN Is that a medical term? 
She turns. Battle lines drawn. 
MRS. DOYLE You want clinical terminology? It's called, "conversation hysteria." (to Abbott now --) I don't know exactly how you train these people. I'm not sure I want to know. I'll take a guess there's some extremely rigorous behavior modification going on here. 
Silence. The idea dangling for a moment. 
ABBOTT Let's assume that's true. 
MRS. DOYLE You can only wind people so tight. Even machines break down. 
CONKLIN This unit has an unblemished record of success. 
MRS. DOYLE Then I guess I'm in the wrong meeting. 
EXT. BELLVILLE CAR PARK -- DUSK 
BOURNE and MARIE stashing the red car. 
INT. CIA HALLWAY UPSTAIRS HALLWAY -- DAY 
ABBOTT and CONKLIN walk and talk. They want to get loud, but they can't. Too many people passing by -- 
CONKLIN That was two hours -- two hours to get a second opinion -- and nothing changes. He's loose. He's out of control. It's very clear what needs to happen. (point blank) I have work to do. 
ABBOTT What if he is working for someone else? What if he turned? 
CONKLIN Turn? To who? Where does he turn? What does he have to offer? He's got nothing. He's a killer. He's a piece of equipment for crissake. Where's he gonna turn? 
EXT. HOTEL DE LA PRIX -- NIGHT 
Funky. Out of the way. Cash and carry. No-questions-asked kind of flop. Our establishing shot somehow includes THE PROPRIETOR and HIS DOG. 
INT. THE HOTEL ROOM BATHROOM -- NIGHT 
HAIR DYE washing down a rusted drain. It's MARIE alone in this crappy little bathroom. Jeans and bra. All of it soaking wet. 
A new hair color. 
A MIRROR. There she is. Her turn to stare at herself and wonder. 
And then she smells something. Smoke... 
INT. THE HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT 
It's a shitty little room. BOURNE sitting on the bed. And the smoke is coming from... 
HIS PASSPORT -- the Jason Bourne passport -- on fire. BOURNE holding it as it burns away. Bourne's face -- melting -- bubbling -- finally disappearing, -- BOURNE letting go just before it burns his fingers and -- 
BOURNE sits back. And there's MARIE standing there. And she's holding out her passport -- 
He looks at her. Big moment. 
BOURNE No. (he won't do it) You know who you are. You know what that's worth? That's everything. (pause) I can't live like this. I can't do anything until I know who I am. Believe me, you don't want what I have. 
He looks away. Silence. And then, she touches him. His shoulder. 
BOURNE almost recoils. Almost. He doesn't know what to do. Doesn't know how to react. 
MARIE in front of him now -- she's taking his hand -- and he hesitates -- looking at her -- is this happening? -- she's taking his hand -- moving it down her body -- staring at him -- both of them silent -- his hand -- her skin -- his mind racing -- he wants this -- wants it in every way -- but it's overwhelming -- when was the last time something like this happened? -- he can't remember -- he doesn't care -- he's pulling her toward him -- and they're kissing -- and you know the rest... 
Everybody following -- all of them confused -- and into -- 
FRONT DESK AREA 
BOURNE there first -- all forward motion here -- balls out -- 
BOURNE Is this it? -- (the book) -- this is it, right? -- 
MORGUE BOSS -- slow down -- you can't just take the book like that -- 
BOURNE -- don't sweat it, I have a pen -- no problem -- just let me find the page -- (then quick to Marie) -- honey, why don't you wait for me outside, okay? -- 
MARIE trying to take the hint, but she's curious what he's doing -- 
MORGUE BOSS -- we have rules here, this is a very serious place -- I'm the one who decides who gets in here, okay? -- 
BOURNE -- what do I? -- I put the name of the person I came to see? -- 
MORGUE BOSS -- this is serious business down here and we cannot have people coming and going -- 
BOURNE -- here we go -- I found it -- 
But he's not writing -- he's ripping -- tearing the page out of the book -- 
MORGUE BOSS -- what are you? -- what are you doing? -- you crazy fuck -- you ripped the book! -- you stupid fucki-- (no chance to finish this, because --) 
BOURNE just slammed him against the wall. Hard. Like a tractor hit him. And fast. 
And that shuts up the room. 
THE TWO ATTENDANTS rushing to help their boss -- 
BOURNE grabbing MARIE and pulling her out the door -- 
EXT. PARIS STREET -- NIGHT 
Moments after the morgue. BOURNE striding away. MARIE struggling to keep up. And BOURNE is different now -- zoning in -- he's close -- he's hardening -- 
MARIE What are you doing? -- (he's scaring her) -- Jason -- stop -- talk to me... 
BOURNE ignoring her -- ripping through the Alliance Security brochures -- scanning them as he walks -- 
MARIE -- I don't know what you're doing and you're scaring me -- what are you looking for? -- what just happened in there? -- 
BOURNE Nykwana Wombosi. (he stops, holding up the brochure --) 
MARIE What is that? 
BOURNE It's a name. Mr. Wombosi owns a thirty million dollar yacht. He's the proud owner of an Alliance Security package. (handing her the brochure --) He also paid a visit to the morgue to see John Michael Kane. (the ripped-out page --) 
MARIE What does that mean? (but he's walking again --) Jason, what does that mean? (she's trying to catch up, but he's walking really fast --) Jason, please... who is he? 
BOURNE I don't know. (he's not turning back again --) 
MARIE So what are we doing? 
BOURNE Go back to the hotel. 
MARIE just stops. Reeling. 
BOURNE walking away. Into Paris night and -- 
INT. CONKLIN'S TREADSTONE OFFICE -- DAY/NIGHT? 
ABBOTT alone here. On the phone. Looking up to see -- 
ZORN They found him. They found Bourne. 
ABBOTT jumps off the call. Eyes never leaving ZORN. 
ABBOTT Where? 
ZORN You better come in. 
CONKLIN You don't have the stones for this. You people come down here and wink and whisper and we send these guys out and get it done. And you're clear. And the guys upstairs get what they want. And the whole bunch of you are so stuffed on deniability it's coming out of your ears. (gauntlet) Well, you know what? You're here now. What do you want to do? 
ABBOTT just shaking his head no. 
And CONKLIN snaps -- suddenly he's over the console -- there's the button -- and he's pressing it and -- 
EXT. NEUILLY ROOFTOPS -- NIGHT 
THE PROFESSOR in position -- roof of the house next door -- hum -- hum -- hum -- 
It's the E-PHONE PAGER -- he's just been activated and -- 
INT. WOMBOSI'S COMPOUND HALLWAY -- NIGHT 
BOURNE being marched toward the throne room doors -- DEAUVAGE and BODYGUARD #1 flanking him -- KIDS and WIVES staring as he passes -- the way you'd look at a prisoner on the way to the gallows -- 
THE BIG DOORS thrown open wide and -- 
WOMBOSI on the throne. 
WOMBOSI Come in. (an imperial gesture) Please... 
BOURNE steps up to the plate. 
WOMBOSI Did you bring investment advice for me tonight? It was tax shelters, wasn't it? Swiss debenture-swaps. 
BOURNE MPG Capital. 
WOMBOSI I think investment advice from a dead man, it's a bad idea. (beat) How does it feel to be dead? 
BOURNE It's a lot more stressful than I thought. 
KIDS have started sneaking into the room -- DEAUVAGE is trying to scoot them out but -- 
WOMBOSI -- no -- no, let them in! -- let them in. (to the kids) Come in -- on y va -- come in... (to Bourne) I think everyone wants to see the dead man. 
BOURNE watching the kids -- they are all staring -- 
WOMBOSI What do you do? (on his feet now --) You get an appointment with me? You make sure it's on the boat? You come visit me -- you pitch me this bullshit investment package. You drink my water -- eat my bread -- play with my children -- and what? -- two nights later you come back and you put this death -- (slamming something down onto the throne --) -- you put this in my engine room! 
There is A BOMB on the throne now. 
WOMBOSI So this is a different kind of meeting. (steam building) Maybe now we talk some truth, okay? One dead man to another. 
BOURNE -- caught off guard as -- WOMBOSI suddenly rips away his jacket -- so hard that he tears straight through to the shirt -- 
BOURNE'S BACK -- bare -- two bullet scars -- still raw -- 
WOMBOSI You see this? (calling to Deauvage --) I told you my shot was better! 
DEAUVAGE He went in the water -- how did he live? 
WOMBOSI No, no no... (and he means this --) This is a strong killer. This is a crazy strong killer. Oh, yeah... (circling) To make a killer that looks like you? This young? This face? (he means this) It's bloody fucking amazing. 
BOURNE imploding -- this news -- the kids staring at him -- the bomb -- it's all getting loud around him -- 
BOURNE Who do you think sent me? 
WOMBOSI I know who sent you. I don't know why. (this could get physical at any moment now --) I learned many, many things from the CIA. Many things. I learned the way they think. (beat) Was the bomb on my boat supposed to go off or not? 
BOURNE distracted by the kids -- these faces -- it's... 
WOMBOSI You didn't set the bomb. Why? 
BOURNE not sure -- about any of it -- 
WOMBOSI Was this a game or a fuck up? 
BOURNE I don't know. 
WOMBOSI Get the kids out! 
He doesn't have to say it twice -- they know the drill -- they're gone. 
MARIE Yes. That's who I want to be. 
BOURNE nods. Turns off the light. Takes her hand. And they lay in bed. Just laying there. 
INT. PARIS SOMEWHERE -- NIGHT 
THE PROFESSOR cooping somewhere. Tending to his wounds. Ignoring his pager. He's slipped off the grid. 
INT. HOTEL ROOM -- DAWN 
BOURNE and MARIE packing up to hit the road. Together. 
DOUG'S ROUGH DRAFT OF THE BIG ACTION SEQUENCE 
INT. HOTEL DE LA PAIX -- LOBBY -- DAY 
MARIE dropping off the key. Hope hangs in the air -- 
CLERK xxxxxx... 
MARIE xxxxxx 
BOURNE enters. He's got the black duffel. Car keys. 
BOURNE xxxxxx. 
MARIE xxxxxx 
And now they're headed for the door. Something doesn't feel right for BOURNE -- and then he notices -- 
BOURNE Stop where you are. 
MARIE What? 
Bourne turns back to the CLERK. 
BOURNE Where's the dog? 
CLERK My husband's out looking for him. 
BOURNE He run away often? 
CLERK That old beast? Miss his breakfast? Not a chance. (returning to cleaning) It's always something, right? 
Suddenly -- just like that -- everything's different -- 
BOURNE Get in the basement. 
CLERK What? 
BOURNE (to Marie) Get everyone down in the basement. 
Now MARIE doesn't need a second warning -- 
CLERK What the hell're you talking about? 
BOURNE You're in danger. All of you. I have no time to explain. 
CLERK Wait a minute -- 
BOURNE I'm sorry. 
-- those words -- the way he said it -- she's grabbing her purse, clearing out of the room. Slamming the door behind her -- click -- it's locked. 
MARIE Jason... 
No answer -- too busy -- reaching under the check-in desk, coming up with -- A SHOT GUN, an old one, but nonetheless a gun -- 
MARIE Who is it? Who's out there? 
And now BOURNE is moving, pulling open a drawer.  A box of shells. Filling his pockets. 
BOURNE xxxxxx 
They are shredding the street -- FIRING ruthlessly at each other and -- NOW THE POLICE ARE HERE -- BLOCKING both ends of the street. GUNS are drawn -- BOURNE's vulnerable on two flanks. The COPS are YELLING. And now -- 
THE PROFESSOR BLASTS the COPS -- And now things have changed. 
THREE WAY FIREFIGHT and BOURNE grabs MARIE and they dive into -- 
INT. SMALL EPICERIE -- DAY 
And the PROFESSOR shreds the store as BOURNE attemps to fire back. SHIT flying everywhere in here -- hard to see and -- The PROFESSOR is advancing on them -- cops are no match for his fire power. They move to the back -- kick open a door -- 
INT. HIGHWALLED COURTYARD -- DAY 
BOURNE and MARIE cross this small courtyard, the PROFESSOR is right on their heels. CRASH through a door -- and now they are in -- 
INT. SMALL SWEATSHOP -- DAY 
COUPLE of ASIAN WOMEN sewing in here. One MAN in charge -- and BOURNE and MARIE charging through -- the MAN about to say something -- but now the PROFESSOR is on their tail and -- 
INT. SMALL AFRICAN SHOP -- DAY 
Making god knows what in here -- vats of something. Small grouping of workers -- BOURNE shutting the door behind him -- it's shredded with BULLET HOLES. BOURNE and MARIE racing to the next door as -- BAM -- the PROFESSOR kicks the door open -- BOURNE about to fire -- but there is a WOMAN right behind the PROFESSOR! Can't do it -- turns to run as -- RATATATAT -- 
The PROFESSOR FIRES as BOURNE and MARIE dive into -- 
INT. LIVE POULTRY SHOP -- DAY 
And now CHICKEN feathers are flying everywhere -- the glass at the front of the door is shattering. BOURNE and MARIE make it through the gauntlet. 
EXT. BELLEVILLE -- STREET -- DAY 
And BOURNE and MARIE are running. And he is reaching into his pocket -- fishing around -- and just as he pulls out the car keys -- we recognize this as the street they parked their car on and -- 
BY MARIE'S CAR 
BOURNE unlocks the door -- pops MARIE's open. And -- 
THERE'S A COP -- yelling at them and -- BOURNE hits the gas -- they fly out of their parking space -- BAM!! The COP fires, shattering their windshield and there -- up ahead -- THE PROFESSOR coming out -- about to FIRE -- BOURNE aims for him -- forces him to dive out of the way and -- ONE QUICK MOVE around a TRUCK and they are free. 
INT. THE LITTLE RED CAR 
BOURNE and MARIE looking back nervously -- so far all over -- 
ON THE STREET 
The PROFESSOR looking around. PEOPLE staring at him -- covered in blood -- the COP racing up -- yelling -- not yelling for long because the PROFESSOR is firing at him and -- 
Now the PROFESSOR is moving -- not running -- just a swift walk and now he's past the truck -- and -- 
A MOTORCYCLIST comes flying down the street -- oblivious -- going way too fast for these streets and -- the PROFESSOR swings his gun stock like a bat -- takes him out -- clean and smooth -- bike crashing to the ground and -- 
The PROFESSOR grabs the bike and takes off -- SHOOTING at TWO POLICE CARS just racing to the scene and we are into -- 
EXT. BELLEVILLE BLVD -- DAY 
HIGH SPEED CAR CHASE. And BOURNE better do some fancy driving because here comes the PROFESSOR -- and he's a lot faster -- much better armed. 
INT. MARIE'S CAR 
BOURNE driving. MARIE looking back -- seeing the PROFESSOR gain on them -- 
MARIE xxxxxx 
BOURNE xxxxxx 
And -- THE PROFESSOR FIRES -- SHREDS the back off their car -- 
MARIE Give me the gun -- 
And now she's got his shotgun, leaning out the window. 
BOURNE Wait 'till he's close. 
BOURNE swerves, up on the sidewalk back onto the street -- slaloms through the traffic -- racing towards an intersection and -- 
THE ANGRY COPS -- remember them? -- the ones who took the ride down the steps -- they're firing now and -- 
BOURNE AND MARIE turn back -- the PROFESSOR is firing and there is only one option -- 
INT. METRO CAR -- DAY 
BOURNE and MARIE into the conductor booth. People diving off the train as BOURNE hits the YELLOW BUTTON and -- the TRAIN STARTS ROLLING -- doors still open -- they disappear into the protection of the tunnel walls -- then BOURNE hits the button to close the doors and -- THE PROFESSOR -- watching the trains accelerate out of the station -- and now he's racing his bike down the platform -- opposite the motion of the train and -- here comes the end of the train and --THE PROFESSOR throws his bike into a skidding 180 and skids off the platform all in one move -- landing hard on the tracks but facing the right direction and now he's accelerating towards the train -- just as an oncoming train is racing into the station and -- HE LEAPS onto the back of the train in the nick of time. His GUN CLATTERS to the tracks. 
IN THE LAST METRO CAR 
The window is shattered and the PROFESSOR lets himself in -- wind whipping through his hair from the shattered windows. And -- 
IN THE FIRST METRO CAR 
BOURNE and MARIE finally getting a breather. BOURNE keeps looking back -- nothing -- the train is deserted. Finally -- 
MARIE xxxxxx 
BOURNE xxxxxx 
MARIE xxxxxx 
BOURNE xxxxxx 
And ahead -- daylight -- the train tracks go above ground and as the train hits daylight -- we see the PROFESSOR directly behind BOURNE on the other side of the glass and -- 
CRASH! The PROFESSOR grabs BOURNE through the glass, ramming his head into the metal as -- 
BOURNE grabs the knob, swings the door open and CRUSHES the PROFESSOR -- CRUSHES him again and now he is free and -- 
BOURNE turns, pulls up the shotgun and -- the PROFESSOR kicks it out of his hands -- it clatters to the ground and now we have a beat -- THE TRAIN CAR races across the Bir Hakeim bridge -- all of Paris laid out behind them. BOURNE and the PROFESSOR squaring off -- both looking at the gun -- realizing there's no chance for either one of them to get it and -- 
A BRUTAL RUTHLESS FIGHT breaks out. BOURNE's motivated -- the PROFESSOR's crazy -- makes it a pretty even match. Looks like it could go on for a little while when suddenly -- 
BAM!!! The PROFESSOR drops to the ground -- behind him -- MARIE wields the shot gun. 
MARIE xxxxxx 
BOURNE xxxxxx 
And BOURNE takes the gun from her -- standing there -- reloading -- both barrels -- raising the gun -- aiming it -- 
INT. MOVING METRO CAR -- DAY 
THE PROFESSOR sitting there. Like a dummy. Like a puppet that's been propped up. He's fucked -- his whole side ravaged with shot -- his arm shredded -- hand barely there -- blood flowing fast -- 
BOURNE Who else is coming? 
THE PROFESSOR staring up at the gun. Stunned. Doomed. Mouth dry. Eyes struggling to make sense of the chaos. 
BOURNE I won't ask again. 
PROFESSOR I work alone. Like you... (confused beat) ...we always work alone. 
BOURNE What do you mean? 
PROFESSOR Who are you? Rome? Paris? (Bourne is just staring --) Treadstone... both of us... I was warned but... 
BOURNE Treadstone? 
PROFESSOR ...which one are you?... 
BOURNE lowering the weapon -- head swimming -- 
BOURNE Paris. I live in Paris... 
PROFESSOR ...headaches... you have that... I get such bad headaches... 
BOURNE Yes. 
PROFESSOR ...it's a problem... 
He's losing blood fast -- things inside him seizing up --

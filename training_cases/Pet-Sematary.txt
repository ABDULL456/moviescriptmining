FADE IN ON 
that most persistent summer SOUND: crickets in high grass-- ree-ree-ree-ree... This in dark which slowly 
DISSOLVES TO: 
EXT.  A GRAVE MARKER  SUMMER DAY 
It's a plywood cross leaning aslant. Written on the crossarm in black paint which has faded: SMUCKY  HE WAS OBEDIENT. The letters are faded. They are also straggling and ill-formed--the work of a child. 
MAIN TITLES BEGIN. 
EXT.  ANOTHER GRAVE MARKER 
A child's printing again, this time on a chunk of warped crating: BIFFER BIFFER A HELLUVA SNIFFER UNTIL HE DIED HE MADE US RICHER 
MAIN TITLES CONTINUE 
EXT.  TWO MARKERS 
I think all these shots are LAP DISSOLVES. All is silence but for the crickets and the wind stirring the grass. Around the markers themselves, the grass has been clipped short, and by some markers there are flowers in cheap vases. Crisco cans, Skippy peanut butter jars, etc. 
These two markers: IN MEMORY OF MARTA OUR PET RABIT DYED MARCH 1, 1965 (on a wide flat board) and GEN PATTON (OUR! GOOD! DOG!) APRIL 1958 (another board). 
MAIN TITLES CONTINUE 
EXT.  FIVE OR SIX MARKERS 
We can't read all of them; some are too faded (or the "gravestones" themselves too degenerated), but we can see now that this woodland clearing's a rather eerie -- and well-populated -- animal graveyard. 
We can see: POLYNESIA, 1953 and HANNAH THE BEST DOG THAT EVER LIVED. HANNAH'S tombstone is part of an old Chevrolet hood, painstakingly hammered flat. 
MAIN TITLES CONTINUE. 
EXT.  ANGLE ON THE PET SEMATARY 
From here we can see most of the clearing, which is surrounded by forest pines. We can see that the graves--maybe 80 in all--are arranged in rough concentric circles. On the far side of this clearing is the end of a path which spills into this graveyard clearing. The end of the path is flanked by wooden poles which hold up a crude arch. We can see no writing on this side -- the words on the arch face those arriving along the path. 
MAIN TITLES CONTINUE 
EXT.  THE ARCH, FROM THE PATH SIDE, CU 
MAIN TITLES CONCLUDE. Written on the arch in faded black paint is the work of some long-gone child: PET SEMATARY. 
THE CAMERA HOLDS ON THIS FOR A MOMENT OR TWO, THEN PANS SLOWLY DOWN to look through the arch. From this angle we are looking across to a deadfall--a tangle of weather-whitened old dead branches at the back of the graveyard. It's maybe twenty-five feet from side to side and about nine feet high. At either end are thick tangles of underbrush that look impassible. 
AS MAIN TITLES CONCLUDE, THE CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY IN on the deadfall. And as it does, we realize that there is a horrible snarling face in those branches. Is this an accident? Coincidence? Our imagination? Perhaps the audience will wonder. THE CAMERA HOLDS ON IT and then we 
DISSOLVE TO: 
BLACK. And a white title card: MOVING DAY. 
EXT.  A HOUSE IN THE COUNTRY  EVENING 
SOUND of crickets: ree-ree-ree-ree... 
To the left of this house: a big empty field. Behind it: the woods. Before it: a wide two-lane road. 
The house is a pleasant two-story New England dwelling with a shed/garage attached. In front of it is a sign which reads QUINN REALTORS 292 HAMMOND STREET, BANGOR. A big SOLD strip, like a bumper sticker, has been plastered across it diagonally. 
GROWING SOUND: the rumble of a truck. A big, big truck. It belts between the CAMERA and the house -- a tanker truck with a silver body and the word ORINCO written on the side in blue letters. Its short-stack is blowing quantities of dark brown smoke. Behind it comes a Ford wagon, which slows, signals, and turns into the driveway of the house we've been looking at. 
EXT.  REAR OF THE WAGON 
As LOUIS CREED brings it to a stop we get a good look at the license plate (Illinois) and a bumper sticker (HAVE YOU HUGGED YOUR M.D. TODAY?) 
The ENGINE SOUND stops. For a moment or two we hear only the ree- ree-ree-ree of crickets. Then: 
ELLIE CREED (voice) Is this our new house, daddy? 
LOUIS CREED (voice) This is it. 
EXT.  THE WAGON, A NEW ANGLE 
The two front doors and one back door open. LOUIS CREED, about 32, gets out from the driver's side. RACHEL CREED, his wife, gets out from the passenger side. From the rear door comes ELLIE CREED, a girl of 6. They are staring, fascinated, at the house. 
They come together, the three of them, by the front of the wagon, still staring at the house. LOUIS is clearly nervous. 
LOUIS So...what do you think? 
RACHEL begins to smile. She turns to LOUIS and hugs him. 
RACHEL It's gorgeous! 
ELLIE Am I really gonna have my own room? 
LOUIS Yes. 
ELLIE Yaay! 
She looks toward the side lawn and sees a tire on a rope hanging down from the bough of a tree. 
ELLIE (to RACHEL) Is that a swing? 
RACHEL Yes, but the rope might be-- 
ELLIE Yaay! 
She goes running toward it. RACHEL gives LOUIS a tired smile. 
LOUIS Let her go. It's cool. 
RACHEL Louis, the house is beautiful. 
They kiss--gently at first, then more passionately. As he draws her more tightly against him, a baby--GAGE--begins to cry from the car. LOUIS and RACHEL break the clinch. 
RACHEL The Master of Disaster awakes. 
This SOUND is joined by the unhappy yowling of a pent-up tomcat. 
LOUIS And Buckaroo Banzai. 
RACHEL Come on--let's parole 'em. 
They walk to the car, RACHEL going to one of the back seat doors, LOUIS to the rear of the wagon. 
He takes a step into the road...and then big, gnarled hands grab him. 
GAGE looks rather surprised at this, but not worried--this kid is used to being picked up and treated humanely. To GAGE strangers are as interesting as...well, as interesting as Orinco trucks. 
EXT.  GAGE AND JUD CRANDALL 
The fellow who has picked GAGE up is a man of about eighty in old blue jeans, a faded Bruce Springsteen t-shirt. Over this he wears a faded khaki vest with bright silver buttons. His face is deeply wrinkled and kindly. 
JUD CRANDALL (to GAGE) No you don't, my friend--not in that road. 
But he softens this with a grin. GAGE grins back at him. 
GAGE Drucks! 
JUD (low) No shit, Sherlock. 
JUD carries him up the driveway to the station wagon. Here he's joined by LOUIS and RACHEL, out of breath and really scared. ELLIE brings up the rear. She's still sniffling. 
RACHEL Gage! 
JUD (hands him to her) He was headed for the road, looked like. I corralled him for you, missus. 
RACHEL Thank you. Thank you so much. 
LOUIS Yes--thanks. I'm Louis Creed. 
He sticks out his hand and JUD shakes it. LOUIS takes it easy--no crushing JayCees grip, or anything like that--the old guy looks as if he might have arthritis. 
JUD Jud Crandall. I live just across the road. 
RACHEL I'm Rachel. Thanks again for saving the wandering minstrel boy, here. 
JUD No harm, no foul. But you want to watch out for that road. Those damn trucks go back and forth all day and most of the night. 
He leans over toward ELLIE. 
JUD Who might you be, little Miss? 
ELLIE I'm Ellen Creed and I live at 642 Alden Lane, Dearborn, Michigan. (Pause) At least, I used to. 
JUD And now you live on Route 9 in Ludlow, and your dad's gonna be the new doctor up to the college, I hear, and I think you're going to be just as happy as a clam here, Ellen Creed. 
ELLIE (to LOUIS) Are clams really happy? 
They all laugh--even GAGE. 
RACHEL Excuse me, Mr. Crandall--I've got to change this kid. It's nice to meet you. 
JUD Same here. Come over and visit when you get the chance. 
As RACHEL, carrying GAGE, moves away: 
ELLIE (worries) Daddy, do I really have to have the stingy stuff? 
LOUIS No-I guess not. 
ELLIE Yayyy! 
She goes belting off. 
JUD (amused) I guess your daughter there ain't going to die after all. 
LOUIS (also amused) I guess not. 
JUD House has stood empty for too long. It's damn good to see people in it again. 
SOUND: A truck engine, gearing down. 
EXT.  A MOVING VAN 
It blinks and comes lumbering into the Creed's driveway. 
EXT.  LOUIS AND JUD 
LOUIS Hey--they actually found the place! 
JUD Movin' in's mighty thirsty work. I usually sit out on my porch of an evening and pour a couple of beers over m'dinner. Come on over and join me, if you want. 
LOUIS Well, maybe I---- 
RACHEL (voice) Louis, what's this? 
EXT.  RACHEL AND GAGE 
GAGE has been changed, and RACHEL is following him as he explores the nearest edges of the new homestead. They are fairly close to the wreckage of the tire swing, and here is the head of the path ELLIE has already glimpsed. 
EXT.  LOUIS AND JUD 
They cross to the van. The FIRST and SECOND MOVERS are just climbing out of the van. 
FIRST MOVER You Mr. Creed? 
LOUIS Yes. Just a second. 
EXT.  RACHEL AND GAGE, AT THE HEAD OF THE PATH 
She's holding GAGE on her hip now, and both of them are looking at that strange (and oddly enticing) path which disappears into the deepening twilight. LOUIS and JUD join them. 
LOUIS The movers-- 
RACHEL Yes--I know. This path, Louis? Where does it go? 
LOUIS I don't have the slightest idea. When I saw the house, this field was under four feet of snow. 
RACHEL (smiling) I bet Mr. Crandall knows! 
JUD nods. He smiles, too, but underneath the smile we sense that he is serious. 
JUD Oh, ayuh! I know. It's a good story, and a good walk, too. I'll take you up there sometime, and tell you the story, too-- after you get settled in. 
He smiles at them and they smile back--it is a look of understanding and real liking, in spite of the age difference between the CREEDS and JUD. 
EXT.  THE CREED HOUSE  NIGHT 
SOUND: Crickets. Ree--ree--ree-ree... 
There's one light upstairs, one downstairs. Perhaps we see the path, glimmering away into the field? Either by virtue of it being mown, or by virtue of some gentle optical trick? Maybe. 
INT.  THE LIVING ROOM  NIGHT 
There's a light on in the kitchen, but it just casts a dim glow in here. The room has a fireplace and a lovely wooden floor. It's going to be nice, but now it's just a big bare box with movers' cartons stacked all over the place. 
LOUIS is drinking a can of Pepsi, and he looks pretty damned tired--anyone who's ever moved house and can remember the first night in the new place will understand. 
A SHAPE suddenly lurches out of the high grass at him, and LOUIS recoils with a startled, muffled cry. 
EXT.  CHURCH 
The cat, sure; who--or what--else? We see his big green eyes in the dark as he cries his strange feline hello: Waow! 
EXT.  LOUIS AND CHURCH, AT THE HEAD OF THE PATH 
LOUIS Church! God, you scared the life out of me! 
CHURCH Waow! 
LOUIS bends and picks up the cat. As he does, that truck SOUND comes again and he looks toward: 
EXT.  THE ROAD, LOUIS'S POV 
Another Orinco tanker drones by, fast. 
EXT.  LOUIS AND CHURCH 
LOUIS (to the cat) I know one thing that will keep you home, good buddy. 
He starts toward the house. 
BLACK. And in that blackness, we see a second title card: THE DEAD SPEAK. 
INT.  A KITCHEN BLACKBOARD, CU  DAY 
Written on it is: MONDAY 1.) CHURCH SPAYED 10 A.M. QUENTIN JOLANDER, D.V.M. And below, in even bigger letters: 2.) ELLIE'S FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL!! 
THE CAMERA PANS LEFT, showing us the kitchen. There are still a few cardboard cartons around, but the place is getting in shape. 
We look out the window and see the CREEDS, led by JUD CRANDALL, climbing the path toward the woods. LOUIS has got GAGE in a Gerrypak. 
EXT.  AT THE TOP OF THE HILL, WITH CREEDS AND JUD 
They are also at the edge of the woods. JUD stops and lets them catch up. 
JUD Take a look behind you. 
They turn around, and their faces express their wonder. 
LOUIS My God! 
RACHEL It's beautiful! 
EXT.  THE VIEW 
It is indeed beautiful. The CREED house is in the f.g., Route 9 just behind it (with one of the ever-present Orinco trucks droning along), but behind that is the great sweep of the Penobscot river valley, dozing under a fall sky of clear blue. 
EXT.  AT THE TOP OF THE HILL, WITH JUD AND THE CREEDS 
JUD You folks ready to go on? 
LOUIS Sure. 
ELLIE But where are we going, Mr. Crandall? 
JUD You'll see soon enough, hon. 
They go into the woods, still following the path. 
EXT.  FOREST  DAY 
These are old woods indeed--huge trunks with dusty sunlight shafting through them. It looks as though man has never made his mark here. 
THE CAMERA PANS SLOWLY DOWN to them, on the path. Here it is carpeted with pine needles, but it is just as clearly marked. 
JUD stops. LOUIS looks glad of the rest; he's sweating and there are wide dark patches under his arms where the Gerrypak's straps are. 
LOUIS Who owns the woods up ahead? Paper companies? 
JUD Nope. The Micmac Indians. What's up ahead is all that's left of their tribal lands. 
ELLIE (giggling) Micmac, Ricmac, Kickmac, Sickmac. 
JUD (smiles) Ayuh, it's a funny word, ain't it? You tired of totin' that yowwen yet, doc? 
LOUIS Not yet...how much further is it? 
JUD Aw, you'll be okay. Less than a mile. 
He starts off again, fresh as a daisy. ELLIE scampers after him. LOUIS rolls his eyes at his wife and RACHEL rolls hers back. Then they press on. 
EXT.  THE ARCH READING PET SEMATARY 
EXT.  JUD AND THE CREEDS, ON THE PATH 
JUD (stopping) This is the place, honey. 
ELLIE is of course second. Se tries to read the words on the arch but can't. She whips around to look at her mother. 
ELLIE What's it say, mommy? 
A strange expression has come over RACHEL'S face--she doesn't like this. Not a bit. 
RACHEL It says Pet Cemetery, hon. It's misspelled, but...that's what it says. 
She runs for the arch. RACHEL starts; looks more uneasy than ever. 
RACHEL Ellen--! 
EXT.  ELLIE 
She's almost under the arch. She looks back, questioning. 
EXT.  RACHEL, LOUIS, JUD 
RACHEL (a bit lame) Be careful. 
EXT.  ELLIE 
She goes racing into the Pet Sematary. 
EXT.  RACHEL, LOUIS, JUD 
JUD lights a cigarette with a wooden match, using his thumbnail. 
JUD I told you it was a bad road, Louis--it's killed a lot of pets and made a lot of kids unhappy. But at least something good come of it. This place. 
ELLIE (excited voice) Mom! Dad! Y'oughtta see it! 
EXT.  ELLIE, AT THE EDGE OF THE SEMATARY 
LOUIS (reluctantly) Church will be fine. I promise. 
ELLIE Yayyyy! 
She runs off, cheered up. And RACHEL is cheered up, too. 
RACHEL Thank you, Louis. 
LOUIS Oh, you're welcome. Only if some- thing should go wrong while he's under the gas--it's a one-in-a-thousand shot, but it happens--you explain to her. 
He gets up and leaves the table. She looks after him, stunned and a little frightened. 
INT.  GAGE 
GAGE (conversationally) Here, Durch! 
He picks up a large glob of scrambled eggs from his tray and throws it in the direction of the cat-carrier. 
INT.  THE CAT-CARRIER 
CHURCH is close to the mesh, looking out. Scrambled eggs hit the mesh, driving him back, surprised. 
EXT.  THE CREED HOUSE  MORNING 
The school bus pulls up, red lights flashing. ELLIE runs toward it across the lawn, with her lunch-box. 
EXT.  LOUIS, RACHEL, AND GAGE, IN THE FRONT DOORWAY 
RACHEL Have a great day! 
LOUIS grabs GAGE'S hand and makes him wave it. 
GAGE Bye-bye! 
EXT.  THE BUS 
ELLIE climbs aboard. The red flashers go out and the bus pulls away. 
EXT.  THE CREED DRIVEWAY  MORNING 
The station wagon is parked there. LOUIS comes out with a heavy briefcase in one hand and the cat-carrier in the other. He opens the wagon's doorgate. 
A small car turns into the CREED driveway and parks beside LOUIS. A rather sour-looking middle-aged woman gets out and crosses the front of her car. Her color is bad. This is MISSY DANDRIDGE. She looks at the cat-carrier. 
MISSY Gonna get his-- 
LOUIS --nuts cut, yes. Thank you, Missy, for introducing that colorful phrase into my daughter's vocabulary. 
MISSY Don't mention it. 
She opens the passenger side door of her car and we see a big neat pile of folded sheets. She reaches for them, then winces and presses her hands against her midriff for a moment, as if with an attack of indigestion. 
LOUIS (sees this) How's that belly-ache of yours? 
MISSY (gets the sheets) No better and no worse. 
LOUIS You ought to see a doctor about it. 
MISSY It'll pass. They always do. 
She starts toward the house with the sheets. 
EXT.  THE SIDE YARD  MORNING 
RACHEL hurries past MISSY, who turns to look and then goes on into the house. LOUIS has just put the cat-carrier into the back of the wagon and closed the doorgate as RACHEL reaches him. 
RACHEL (anxious) Still friends, doc? 
LOUIS appears to consider this seriously for a moment...and then he smiles and hugs her. They kiss. 
RACHEL Thank God. I was a little worried there. Have a great first day at school, doc. No broken bones. 
LOUIS (smiles) Not so much as a sprain. 
EXT.  VICTOR PASCOW AND FRIENDS  MORNING 
PASCOW is in a blanket that is being carried by three boys and one girl. They are all yelling at each other not to joggle him, not to drop him. A small knot of horrified college kids moves with the bearers. 
PASCOW'S head is upside down to the CAMERA, which retreats ahead of the advancing students. Fixed eyes stare. Half of his head has been shattered inward. Before the catastrophe he was a husky male of about twenty. He's dressed in a U of M muscle shirt and red jogging shorts. 
THE CAMERA PULLS JERKILY TO ONE SIDE, allowing the bearers to mount the steps of a brick building. The infirmary. The lookers-on break to either side. The infirmary doors open. 
EXT.. NURSE CHARLTON, AT THE DOORS 
She's the head nurse, a tough old babe of about fifty. 
CHARLTON Holy Jesus. (turns) Steve! Steve! Dr. Creed! Dr. Creed, we've got a mess here! Stat! 
The bearers sweep past her and inside, leaving a red smear of blood across the midriff of MARCY CHARLTON'S uniform. 
INT.  THE INFIRMARY RECEPTION AREA 
THE CAMERA will show us all we need to see, but its movements will seem almost random; this is like being in the hotel kitchen after Sirhan shot Bobby. 
As the students bring in PASCOW, LOUIS comes running, followed by STEVE MASTERTON, his P.A. Standing to one side are two student nurses in candystriper uniforms. They're boggled and horrified. 
LOUIS kneels. THE CAMERA RUSHES FORWARD, shoving between onlookers. LOUIS looks at the wound. There's shattered bone and pulsing brain tissue beneath. 
There's a scream; the girl who was carrying one corner of the blanket is having hysterics. 
GIRL Vic! Vic! Oh Christ! Vic! 
LOUIS (to CHARLTON) Get her out. Get them all out. 
CHARLTON puts her arms around the girl. 
GIRL (struggling) No! No! He can't die! He can't die! 
THE CAMERA MOVES BACK DOWN as LOUIS takes an opthalmascope from STEVE and shines it in PASCOW'S bulging, fixed eyes. 
CHARLTON is just pushing the last of them gawkers and bearers out the door. 
LOUIS Steve, get the ambulance over here right now. He's got to go to EMMC. 
STEVE The ambulance is at Sonny's Sunoco downtown, getting-- 
LOUIS --a new muffler, oh shit-- 
PASCOW makes a weird gargling noise. Blood suddenly spurts out of his mouth. He begins to seizure. 
One of the candystripers shrieks. THE CAMERA JERKS UP TO COVER the student nurses. One turns and throws up on the wall. 
CHARLTON rushes over. 
PASCOW Come on, doc--don't make me tell you twice. 
INT.  LOUIS 
He glances at RACHEL. Although PASCOW has spoken in a fairly loud voice--and the opening door was like a bomb--she's still fast asleep. LOUIS looks back toward PASCOW...and then gets out of bed. He's naked except for a pair of pajama bottoms. 
INT.  PASCOW 
He turns and leaves the doorway. 
INT.  LOUIS 
He reaches the bedroom doorway himself and looks back at: 
INT.  THE BED, LOUIS'S POV 
RACHEL is sleeping as before, and LOUIS himself is also in bed asleep, although his rest is uneasy...as if he's having a bad dream. 
INT.  THE DOORWAY, WITH LOUIS 
LOUIS (relieved) Oh. Thank God. 
PASCOW (Voice) Hurry up, doc. 
INT.  THE KITCHEN 
LOUIS enters and crosses toward the door which gives on the shed/garage. This door stands open. LOUIS pauses by it. 
PASCOW (low) Come on, doc... 
LOUIS goes into: 
INT.  THE SHED/GARAGE 
The station wagon is a dark hulk. LOUIS crosses to it and stands, perplexed. 
PASCOW looms softly behind him and puts an arm around him. LOUIS turns... and suddenly his face is less than an inch from PASCOW'S mutilated face. 
PASCOW Let's go, doc. 
LOUIS (moans) I don't like this dream. 
PASCOW Who said you were dreaming? 
He begins to move toward the garage door. After a moment LOUIS follows him. 
EXT.  THE FIELD BEHIND THE HOUSE, LONG  NIGHT 
We can see two shapes moving up the path toward the woods--PASCOW and, behind him, LOUIS. 
EXT.  THE PET SEMATARY ARCH 
CAMERA HOLDS, THEN PANS DOWN as LOUIS passes under the arch. 
EXT.  LOUIS, CLOSE 
He looks around, obviously afraid. 
EXT.  THE PET SEMATARY, LOUIS'S POV 
We can see why. By starlight this is one scary place. 
EXT.  LOUIS 
He suddenly sees something else, and now his fear is close to terror. 
EXT.  THE DEADFALL, LOUIS'S POV 
The face is back in the tumbled branches. It yawns and snarls. 
EXT.  LOUIS 
He walks toward the deadfall as if hypnotized. PASCOW'S hand falls on his shoulder. LOUIS turns, terrified. 
EXT.  PASCOW, CLOSE 
He really is a dreadful mangled mess. 
PASCOW This is the place where the dead speak. 
EXT.  LOUIS 
He closes his eyes. 
LOUIS I want to wake up. I want to wake up, that's all. I-- 
EXT.  LOUIS AND PASCOW 
PASCOW The door must not be opened. The barrier must not be crossed. Don't go on, doc. No matter how much you feel you have to. There's more power here than you know. 
He points at: 
EXT.  THE DEADFALL 
That grinning face--and perhaps now there are other effects as well, subtle but there? Dim red light? A misty smoke drifting through the tumbled dead branches? The director will know. 
After a moment there is a HUGE GRUNTING ROAR from the woods behind the deadfall--it sounds like no animal we've ever heard before. There is the sound of something huge shifting and snapping a tree like a toothpick. 
EXT.  PASCOW AND LOUIS 
LOUIS has crumbled to PASCOW'S feet. His eyes are squeezed tightly shut. 
LOUIS Please, I want to wake up. Leave me alone. It's not my fault you died; you were as good as dead when they brought you in-- 
PASCOW The power of this place is old and always restless. Sometimes the dead do more than speak. Remember, doc. 
CAMERA BEGINS MOVING SLOWLY IN ON LOUIS. 
LOUIS Leave me alone! 
PASCOW Remember. 
CAMERA IS TIGHT ON LOUIS. 
RADIO (voice) --another beautiful day in Maine! This is Michael O'Hara sayin' that the git-go ain't gonna be that bad. Temps are going all the way up to 70... We got the Ramones for Ludlow...here's "Sheena." 
As the Ramones start blasting "Sheena Is A Punk Rocker": 
INT.  LOUIS, IN BED 
His eyes snap open. He's in his own bedroom. As he sits up THE CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS OUT so we can see that he's in bed alone; the covers on RACHEL'S side are thrown back. 
After the initial confusion and fear, LOUIS looks deeply relieved; he looks the way I suppose we all look upon waking up and realizing our worst dreams were only dreams after all. 
LOUIS and JUD cross the road from the CRANDALL side. LOUIS is carrying the plastic bag in one hand and a flashlight in the other. JUD has a pick and shovel in one hand and a flashlight of his own in the other. 
Evening shadows have grown long. It's maybe an hour until dark. 
JUD and LOUIS stop near the replaced tire-swing. 
EXT.  LOUIS AND JUD 
JUD has a Walkman clipped to the belt of his pants and earphones slung around his neck. 
LOUIS Jud, this is crazy. It's going to be almost dark before we get back. 
JUD It's going to be dark before we even get where we're going, Louis. But we can do it...and we're going to. 
LOUIS But-- 
JUD Does she love the cat? 
LOUIS Yes, but-- 
JUD Then come on. 
He puts the earphones on, effectively forestalling further argument, and pushes the PLAY button on the Walkman. We can hear Marshall Crenshaw singing "Crystal Girl." JUD starts away. After a moment, LOUIS follows. 
EXT.  THE PET SEMATARY AND THE BACK OF THE ARCH  LATE EVENING 
The SOUND of crickets...ree-ree-ree... 
The SOUND of footfalls. 
Faintly, the SOUND of Huey Lewis and the News, singing "Working For A Living." 
It's now almost twilight. 
JUD and LOUIS enter the Pet Sematary. LOUIS is looking around curiously. 
LOUIS Well, folks, here we are, in Louis Creed Dreamland. 
JUD snaps off the Walkman and puts the earphones around his neck again. 
JUD What say, Louis? 
LOUIS Nothing. (Pause) Do we plant him on the outer circle or start a new one? 
JUD We're still not where we're going. 
He walks past LOUIS and toward the deadfall. LOUIS follows. 
LOUIS What do you mean? 
JUD The place we're going is on the other side of that. 
He points at the deadfall. 
LOUIS We can't climb over that. We'll break our necks! 
JUD No. We won't. I have climbed it a time or two before, and I know all the places to step. Just follow me...move easy...don't look down...and don't stop. If you stop, you'll crash through for sure. 
LOUIS I'm not climbing that. 
JUD Give me the cat. I'll take care of it myself. 
He holds out his hand and LOUIS sees the old man means exactly as he says. After a moment he says: 
LOUIS Let's go. 
JUD starts up one side of the deadfall, and in spite of its snarled tangles, he mounts as easily as a man climbing a flight of stairs. After a few second, LOUIS follows. 
LOUIS (low) Thank God my Blue Cross is paid up. 
EXT.  THEIR FEET 
First JUD'S pass THE CAMERA, then LOUIS'S, partly obscured by the swinging cat-bag. Their feet unerringly find the right branches and just as unerringly miss holes which look like ankle-breakers. 
EXT.  LOUIS 
He's grinning, exhilarated. 
LOUIS God, this is amazing! 
EXT.  JUD 
There are beads of sweat on the old man's face. He looks both stern and a little scared. 
JUD Just don't stop and-- 
EXT.  LOUIS 
He looks down. 
EXT.  LOUIS'S FEET 
A dead branch snaps under one of them like a gunshot and that foot plunges down maybe six inches. 
EXT.  LOUIS 
He lurches to the edge of balance, then regains it. 
LOUIS And don't look down. Right. 
He continues. 
EXT.  THE DEADFALL, REVERSE  TWILIGHT 
JUD reaches the top and starts down the far side. LOUIS reaches the top. 
EXT.  LOUIS 
LOUIS (amazed) Holy...! 
EXT.  BIG GOD WOODS, LOUIS'S POV 
In the dying glow of twilight, this should be a mystic, awe- inspiring shot. There's no more scrub underbrush and junk pines and juniper-bracken here; ancient firs rise almost like Sequoias. The sunset light shafts among them. This is a real forest... an old forest. And winding upward among the trees along that needle- carpeted floor, clearly marked by large white stones, the path goes on. 
EXT.  LOUIS 
He's stopped on top of the deadfall, still surveying all this with frank amazement. 
EXT.  JUD 
JUD (turns to look) Come on, Louis--don't stop! 
EXT.  LOUIS, ATOP THE DEADFALL 
JUD'S panting and out of breath; LOUIS is, if anything, in worse shape. 
JUD Almost there, Louis. 
LOUIS You keep saying that. 
JUD This time I mean it. 
He tops the last step and stands on a rocky level under the stars, the wind blowing his hair off his deeply lined brow. A few moments later LOUIS joins him and stares with undisguised wonder. 
EXT.  THE MICMAC BURYING GROUND, LOUIS AND JUD'S POV 
The top of this hill or bluff is rocky and bare, but there are a number of rocky piles. But for every pile of rocks we can see, there are ten littered heaps, as if the neat piles had been burst apart. There's a shape to all of this, and it is the shape of the Pet Sematary: concentric circles. 
SOUND: The wind, blowing ceaselessly. 
EXT.  LOUIS AND JUD, AT THE EDGE OF THE BURYING GROUND 
LOUIS (awed) What is this place? 
JUD This was their burying ground, Louis. 
LOUIS Whose burying ground? 
JUD The Micmac Indians. I brought you here to bury Ellen's cat. 
LOUIS Why? For God's sake, why? 
JUD I had my reasons, Louis. We'll talk later. All right? 
LOUIS I guess so...but... 
JUD You want to rest a bit before you start? 
LOUIS No, I'm okay. Will I really be able to dig him a grave? The soil looks thin. 
JUD Soil's thin, all right. But you'll manage. 
He hands him the pick and shovel. 
JUD I'm going to sit over yonder and have a smoke. I'd help you, but you've got to do it yourself. Each buries his own. That's how it was done then. 
JUD walks away, leaving LOUIS with the digging tools in one hand and the flashlight in the other. After a minute, LOUIS walks out into the burying ground. 
EXT.  LOOKING DOWN INTO A SHALLOW HOLE  NIGHT 
SOUND: The wind. It blows ceaselessly up here. 
The hole's about two and a half feet deep. Stubby rocks protrude from the sides. The pick comes down, hits a rock at the bottom, and flashes fire. 
EXT.  LOUIS 
He drops the pick and sticks his hurt hands in his armpits. Beside him we see a low pile of rocks and earth. 
JUD (voice) Should be deep enough. 
He joins LOUIS. He's got a lot of rocks in his arms. 
LOUIS You think so? 
He notices the rocks. 
LOUIS What are those for? 
JUD Your cairn. 
EXT.  THE MICMAC BURYING GROUND, LOUIS'S POV 
Those tumbled piles of rock are very obvious. 
EXT.  LOUIS AND JUD, BY CHURCH'S GRAVE 
LOUIS Doesn't look like they last long. 
JUD Don't worry about that. 
LOUIS Jud, why am I doing all this? 
JUD Because it's right. 
He walks off again. 
LOUIS looks after him for a moment, then kneels down. 
EXT.  LOUIS, BY THE GARBAGE BAG 
He opens it and looks in at CHURCH'S stiffening corpse. 
LOUIS Pax vobiscum, Church old buddy. You were a hell of a god cat. I doubt if you were worth all this aggravation, but you were a hell of a good cat. 
He tumbles the bag containing the body into the grave, and then begins pushing the stony soil over it with the spade. 
EXT.  THE CAIRN, CU  NIGHT 
LOUIS'S hands come into the frame and add a final two or three stones. 
EXT.  LOUIS, BY THE CAIRN 
He looks at it for a moment and stands up. JUD is right there. 
JUD That's fine. You did real good. 
LOUIS looks at him. 
EXT.  THE CREED HOUSE  NIGHT 
There's a light on in the kitchen, but that's all. There's silence at first, and then the PHONE STARTS RINGING. 
EXT.  LOUIS'S FIELD  NIGHT 
LOUIS and JUD are coming down the path with their tools and their lights. They are both clearly fagged out. 
SOUND, FAINT: The telephone. 
LOUIS Oh, shit! Rachel! 
He drops the tools and sprints. 
EXT.  THE CREED'S SIDE YARD, BY THE TIRE SWING 
LOUIS runs into the side yard. SOUND of the phone is louder. 
EXT.  THE KITCHEN DOOR OF THE CREED HOUSE, WITH LOUIS 
EXT.  THE SIDE YARD, LOUIS'S POV 
Grass and fallen leaves. No sign of CHURCH. 
EXT.  LOUIS'S STUNNED FACE, CU 
INT.  THE KITCHEN, WITH LOUIS 
He's spooning cat-food into a dish. He goes to the door--there should be a total of three doors in the kitchen: one to the living room, one to the shed/garage, and one which leads directly outside. LOUIS uses this latter door now. 
EXT.  THE KITCHEN STOOP, WITH LOUIS 
He puts the dish of food down and sits beside it. 
LOUIS Food, Church...food! 
SOUND: Miaow. 
EXT.  THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE, LOUIS'S POV 
CHURCH comes slinking out of the bushes and comes slowly toward THE CAMERA. He stops, looking mistrustful. 
EXT.  LOUIS 
LOUIS Come on, Church! Chow down! 
EXT.  CHURCH 
He crosses to the stoop and begins eating the food. 
LOUIS (to himself) Christ. I don't believe this. 
He picks CHURCH up. CHURCH miaows again--he wants the food. 
LOUIS (wincing) God, you stink, Church. 
CHURCH is looking at the food, trying to get out of LOUIS'S arms. 
LOUIS In a second. 
He tilts the cat's head back so he can get a look at CHURCH'S neck. 
EXT.  CHURCH'S NECK, CU (LOUIS'S POV) 
There's some sort of mark here--a clear remnant	of the crash. A line of white fur, or perhaps a dark red scar where no fur at all grows. 
EXT.  LOUIS AND CHURCH, ON THE STOOP 
LOUIS sees something else as he lets the cat's neck go. He tweezes something out of CHURCH'S whiskers. 
EXT.  LOUIS'S HAND, ECU 
It's a shred of green plastic. 
EXT.  LOUIS AND CHURCH 
LOUIS Chewed his way out. Jesus Baldheaded Christ, he ch-- 
CHURCH suddenly claws at his face. 
LOUIS Ow! 
He claps his hand to his face. CHURCH leaps for the food. LOUIS slowly takes his hand away. There are claw marks on his cheek, welling blood. He looks at the cat. 
EXT.  JUD CRANDALL'S GARDEN, WITH JUD 
The garden is a plot of about half an acre. JUD comes trundling slowly along a row, pushing a wheelbarrow. There are several pumpkins in it. JUD is wearing old khaki gardening pants and a Ramones sweatshirt. He's wearing his headphones and we can hear the Romantics doing "What I Like About You." JUD is singing along and bopping a little--as much as his arthritis will allow, if you can dig it. 
He sees a real big pumpkin, stops, and bends over to get it. 
He takes out his pocket-knife and slits the pumpkin-vine. He gets the pumpkin in his arms and stands up. He turns...and LOUIS is right there (kind of a cheap jump, but always fun), looking totally stunned. 
JUD, startled, drops the pumpkin. LOUIS reaches out and slides the phones off JUD'S ears. 
LOUIS What did we do? 
INT.  THE CRANDALL KITCHEN 
LOUIS is sitting at the kitchen table. JUD is at the fridge. JUD comes back with a couple of long-necked bottles of beer and opens them. 
JUD I most generally don't start before noon, but this looks like an exception. 
LOUIS What did we do, Jud? 
JUD Why, saved a little girl from being unhappy...that's all. Drink up, Louis! 
LOUIS drinks about half the beer. 
LOUIS I tried to tell myself I buried him alive. You know--Edgar Allan Poe meets Felix the Cat. But... 
JUD Wouldn't wash? 
LOUIS No. I'm a doctor. I know death when I see it, and Church was dead. He smells horrible and he uses his claws, but he's alive...and I feel like I'm going crazy. It was that place, wasn't it? 
JUD Ayuh. It was the rag-man told me about the place--Stanley Bouchard. Us kids just called him Stanny B. He was half Micmac himself. 
LOUIS drains his beer. 
LOUIS Can I have another one? 
JUD I guess it wouldn't hurt. 
He gets up and goes to the fridge. 
INT.  JUD, AT THE FRIDGE 
JUD The Micmacs used to bury their dead up there long before the whites came. 
He returns to the table with the beer. 
JUD They buried their dead and for a long time their dead stayed buried. Then something happened. Half the tribe died in a season. The rest moved on. They said a Wendigo had soured the ground. 
LOUIS Wendigo? 
JUD Spirit of the north country. Not a good spirit. Wendigos are great liars and tricksters, according to the stories. And if one touches you... 
JUD pauses, perhaps a flustered, and gathers his thoughts. 
JUD Maybe it really was a Wendigo-- I ain't the one to say it wasn't-- or maybe it was just some disease. Whatever the reason, those that were left moved on. But they left that place...the way it is now. 
JUD shrugs, and drinks. 
EXT.  JUD AS A BOY, CU/SEPIA TONE  DAY 
INT.  RACHEL, AT THE KITCHEN SINK 
RACHEL (with great force) Don't shilly-shally, Louis. Promise me. Promise me. Promise me. 
INT.  THE BATHTUB, WITH LOUIS 
The washcloth has slipped enough so we can see his eyes are closed--he's dozing. 
LOUIS Promise... 
INT.  THE CREED KITCHEN TABLE 
To LOUIS, ELLIE, PASCOW, GAGE, and the corpse of SPOT enters JUD, his eyes shocked and staring. 
JUD (to LOUIS) You do it for all the best reasons, but that ain't why. You do it because it gets hold of you...you do it because you have to. 
INT.  LOUIS, IN THE BATHTUB, CU 
The washrag has worked its way down to his mouth by now. His doze is deepening; he's started to snore a little. 
SOUND: A splash. Something has been dropped into the bath. 
LOUIS opens his eyes. Looks puzzled. Looks down. Eyes widen in shock. 
INT.  THE BATHWATER, LOUIS'S POV 
A very large and very mangled dead rat floats in the bath, actually brushing against LOUIS'S chest. Blood has begun to stain the water. 
INT.  LOUIS 
Turns his head, preparatory to leaping out. 
INT.  THE TOILET LID, WITH CHURCH 
Its mouth yawns open. It hisses, showing bloodstained teeth. 
INT.  THE BATHROOM 
LOUIS leaps from the tub. Grabs a towel and begins to rub himself frantically. He's grossed out. The cat tries to arch against him and he hits it. CHURCH falls to the floor, hissing. 
LOUIS looks at the closed door. 
LOUIS How the hell did you get in? 
He may not know that, but he knows how it's going to get out. He opens the door to the upstairs hall. If CHURCH doesn't go at once, LOUIS helps it with his foot. 
Then he looks down at: 
INT.  THE BATHTUB WITH BRER RAT, LOUIS'S POV 
INT.  LOUIS 
Staring at the rat. Over this: THE SOUND OF JET ENGINES. 
EXT.  A DELTA 727 
Its landing gear unfolds preparatory to touching down at Bangor International Airport. 
INT.  A DEPLANING AREA  DAY 
Lots of people making their way up the jetway. 
INT.  LOUIS, OUTSIDE THE SECURITY POINT 
He's looking anxiously for his people. In one hand he's got half a dozen roses. His face lights up. 
INT.  THE DEPLANING AREA, LOUIS'S POV 
Here comes LOUIS'S family. ELLIE is a little ahead. RACHEL is pushing GAGE in his stroller. ELLIE sees LOUIS and lights up. 
ELLIE Daddy! 
She runs for him. 
INT.  JUST OUTSIDE THE SECURITY POINT 
ELLIE comes belting up to LOUIS, weaving among the deplanees like a slalom skier. She leaps into his arms. LOUIS swings her cheerfully. 
LOUIS Hi, sugar! 
She smacks him noisily. He smacks her back just as noisily. 
ELLIE Daddy, is Church all right? 
LOUIS'S face changes. All at once he's watchful. 
LOUIS Yes...I guess so. He was sleeping on the front porch when I left. 
ELLIE Cause I had a bad dream about him. I dreamed he got hit by a car and you and Mr. Crandall buried him in the Pet Sematary. 
LOUIS (trying to smile) That was a silly dream, wasn't it? 
ELLIE Is he really all right? 
LOUIS Yes. 
ELLIE Because you promised. 
LOUIS I know. 
RACHEL reaches them. She's pretty tired. Hair hanging in her face, good travelling clothes now looking a bit wrinkled and a bit stale. 
RACHEL Want to take your son, doc? 
LOUIS does. GAGE is ecstatic. 
LOUIS kisses RACHEL deeply. 
INT.  THE CREED KITCHEN, NIGHT 
CHURCH at the door, waiting to be let out. ELLIE does the honors. CHURCH oils out into the shed/garage. ELLIE closes the door. She looks distressed. She crosses the kitchen again. 
INT.  THE CREED LIVING ROOM, NIGHT 
RACHEL, in a flannel nightgown, is watching TV. LOUIS is reading a medical tome and making notes. GAGE, zipped into a warm blanket suit, is sacking on the couch. 
ELLIE (entering) Can cats have shampoos? 
RACHEL Yes--you have to take them to someone who grooms animals, though. I think it's pretty expensive. 
ELLIE (still upset) I don't care. I'll save up my allowance and pay for it. Church smells bad. 
LOUIS I've noticed it, too. I'll cough up the money, Ellen. 
ELLIE No more chocolate chip cookies. 
LOUIS Huh? 
ELLIE Missy made the best chocolate chip cookies in the world--even Mom said so. Now there won't be any more because she's gonna be dead forever! 
She cries harder. LOUIS reaches out and strokes her hair. 
EXT.  THE STATION WAGON, DAY 
Moving up the country road toward home through blazing fall foliage. 
INT.  TV SCREEN, CU  NIGHT 
On it is a scene from "Night of the Living Dead." 
NEWSCASTER Bizarre as it may seem, it now seems almost beyond doubt: the dead are returning to eat the living. 
ELLIE (voice) Daddy? 
INT.  THE CREED LIVING ROOM  NIGHT 
There's a VCR on top of the TV; LOUIS has been watching "Night." Now he quickly uses the remote control to shut down the TV. 
She's dressed for bed, and comes toward him slowly. 
LOUIS What's up, sugar? 
ELLIE Daddy, do you think Missy Dandridge went to heaven? 
LOUIS 
What? 
INT.  THE KITCHEN, WITH RACHEL 
She's putting away the last of the supper things. She hears this and moves toward the living room door to listen. She doesn't look at all well. Her eyes are red from crying and her face is haggard. 
INT.  THE LIVING ROOM, WITH LOUIS AND ELLIE 
She's gotten up into his lap. 
ELLIE At school Michael McDowell said she was gonna fry in hell. Michael McDowell says all sewersides fry in hell. 
LOUIS Well, I think Michael McDowell is so full of shit he probably squeaks when he walks, my dear. 
INT.  RACHEL, AT THE DOOR 
She smiles a little at this. 
INT.  LOUIS AND ELLIE, IN THE LIVING ROOM 
LOUIS But don't you dare say that. 
ELLIE I won't...is Missy in heaven, do you think? 
LOUIS I don't know, honey. Different people believe all sorts of different things happen to us when we die. Some believe in heaven or hell. Some think we're born again as little children-- 
ELLIE Sure, carnation. Like in that movie you rented, Audrey Rose. 
LOUIS Well, it's actually reincarnation, but you get the idea. And some people think we just wink out...like a candle flame when the wind blows hard. 
ELLIE Do you believe that? 
LOUIS looks toward: 
INT.  THE LIVING ROOM SOFA, WITH CHURCH, LOUIS'S POV 
CHURCH is sleeping. 
INT.  LOUIS AND ELLIE 
LOUIS I think we go on. I'm not sure what happens after we die, but yeah-- I have faith in that. 
ELLIE You believe in it. 
LOUIS Oh, faith's a little more than just believing. 
INT.  RACHEL, AT THE KITCHEN DOOR 
Listening intently. 
INT.  LOUIS AND ELLIE 
LOUIS (continues) I'll tell you what faith is--it's the evidence of the heart; the assurance of things not seen. 
ELLIE I don't get it. 
LOUIS Well, here we are, sitting in my chair. Do you think my chair will be here tomorrow? 
ELLIE Yeah, sure. 
LOUIS Then you have faith in that. But we don't know it will be; after all, some crazed chair-burglar might break in while we're away and steal it, right? 
ELLIE'S giggling. 
INT.  RACHEL, AT THE DOOR 
She's smiling, too...but tears are running down her cheeks. 
INT.  LOUIS AND ELLIE 
LOUIS But we plan on that chair. We believe in that chair. And I plan on going on somehow as Louis Creed, after I die. I believe I will. 
ELLIE (awed) You have faith in that. 
LOUIS Yes ma'am. Just like I have faith that it is now time for Ellen Creed to get ready for bed. So buzz. 
He gets her off his lap. 
ELLIE I'm not tired! 
LOUIS I'm sure you're not. 
ELLIE Then why do I have to go to bed? 
LOUIS Because your mother and I need the rest, sugar. Now buzz. 
She heads toward the stairs. 
INT.  LOUIS AND RACHEL'S BEDROOM 
LOUIS is in bed, reading. RACHEL, wearing a robe over her nightgown, comes in. 
Belting toward THE CAMERA. SOUND of the GROWLING ENGINE. 
EXT.  THE SKY, WITH THE KITE 
LOUIS has clearly gotten it up okay. 
EXT.  LOUIS, IN THE FIELD 
He's holding the string, looking up at the sky. Now he looks back at the picnic table. 
LOUIS Hey, Gage! 
EXT.  THE PICNIC TABLE 
GAGE gets down and runs toward his father. 
EXT.  ROUTE 9 WITH THE ORINCO TANKER 
Belting along fast. SOUND of the Ramones. 
EXT.  THE FIELD, WITH LOUIS AND GAGE 
GAGE runs to his dad, chubby legs working. He reaches him, and LOUIS transfers thee ball of string to GAGE'S hands. 
GAGE Dat? 
LOUIS String! You're flying it, Gage--you got the hammer, my man! 
GAGE Gage fline it? 
LOUIS Bet your boots. Look-- 
LOUIS puts his hands over GAGE'S hands and pulls them down. 
EXT.  THE KITE 
It dips in the sky. 
EXT.  LOUIS AND GAGE 
LOUIS See? 
GAGE Gage fline it!! 
LOUIS (tenderly) Bet your ass, little hero. 
He kisses his son. They look up at: 
EXT.  THE KITE 
Dipping and drifting in that gorgeous fall sky. 
IRWIN GOLDMAN (voice) Where were you while he was playing in the road? Thinking about your stupid medical articles? You stinking shit! You killer of children! 
INT.  THE FUNERAL CHAPEL, WITH LOUIS AND IRWIN 
IRWIN You-- 
But there is no way he can express his outrage with mere words. As LOUIS sits staring numbly up at him, IRWIN punches him in the nose. LOUIS sprawls backward, falling out of the pew onto the floor. 
INT.  THE REAR OF THE CHAPEL, FEATURING RACHEL AND DORY 
RACHEL screams and starts forward. DORY pulls her back. 
RACHEL Louis! Daddy! Stop it! STOP IT! 
INT.  LOUIS AND IRWIN 
LOUIS is getting up groggily. Hs nose is pouring blood. 
IRWIN How do you like that, you son of a bitch? I should have done it sooner! 
IRWIN punches him in the stomach. LOUIS "oofs" and doubles over. 
INT.  ANGLE ON THE OTHER MOURNERS 
Among them we see STEVE MASTERTON and MARCY CHARLTON. 
STEVE (getting up) Hey! 
INT.  LOUIS AND IRWIN 
LOUIS is slowly straightening up. IRWIN is in a sour frenzy of glee. 
IRWIN How do you like that? How do-- 
LOUIS pushes the old man with both hands. 
INT.  IRWIN GOLDMAN 
He goes stumbling and flailing backwards...strikes the coffin... knocks it off its bier. A SCREAM goes up from the mourners. 
INT.  RACHEL AND DORY 
RACHEL screams. Her mother struggles to hold her but RACHEL easily breaks free and goes running down the aisle. 
INT.  ANGLE ON MOURNERS, WITH MARCY AND STEVE 
MARCY Stop them. Right now. 
STEVE gets up and goes toward: 
INT.  THE FRONT OF THE CHAPEL, WITH IRWIN 
He's picking himself out of a tangled mess of coffin and overturned floral tributes. His suit is wet from spilled water. He's weeping. 
LOUIS has just reached him, and that stunned look is gone. I think he intends to do the Cool Jerk all over IRWIN GOLDMAN'S puny little body. IRWIN strikes a Gentleman Jim Corbett pugilistic pose. 
IRWIN Come on! I'm ready for ya! I'll take y'apart! 
As LOUIS wades in, STEVE MASTERTON gets between them...at the last possible moment. 
STEVE Stop it! 
LOUIS swings. STEVE manages to block the punch with his body. 
STEVE Stop it! Jesus, what's wrong with you, Louis? It's your son's funeral, not a boxing match! 
That gets to LOUIS. He drops his fists. That stunned expression creeps over his face again--that look that says he doesn't have the slightest clue as to what's going on or how it could possibly have happened. 
INT.  LOUIS 
PASCOW (voice) The soil of a man's heart is stonier, doc-- 
Horrible understanding dawns on his face. He whips around and sees: 
EXT.  GAGE, LOUIS'S POV 
The kid's almost in the road; the ball of twine is in it. 
RISING DRONE OF THE TRUCK. 
EXT.  THE ONCOMING TRUCK 
EXT.  GAGE, RUNNING INTO THE ROAD 
GAGE (cheerful) Geddit-geddit-geddit! 
EXT.  EVERYONE, KITE'S POV 
GAGE reaches the middle of the road as the truck comes around the corner. LOUIS is running across the field, getting close to the side of the road. RACHEL is clutching ELLIE by the picnic table. JUD is helplessly trying to wave the truck down as it passes him. 
EXT.  GAGE, IN THE ROAD 
As he reaches the broken white line he grabs the ball of string. 
SOUND OF THE ONCOMING TRUCK. 
GAGE turns his head. 
GAGE (not afraid) Druck! 
EXT.  THE ONCOMING TRUCK AND THE DRIVER, GAGE'S POV 
Suddenly THE DRIVER'S face turns into a Halloween mask of horror. He BLASTS THE AIR-HORN. 
EXT.  LOUIS, ON THE VERGE OF THE ROAD 
LOUIS (shrieks) NO!! 
EXT.  GAGE 
BLARE OF THE AIR-HORN. A shadow falls over his face. There is an audible CLICK! and we FREEZE FRAME. What we have now is a tremen- dously winning photograph of a little boy, not quite two, with a ball of string in his hand...and a shadow lying across his face. 
EXT.  PHOTO MONTAGE 
a.) LOUIS is pushing RACHEL out of a hospital door. RACHEL is in a wheelchair and looks radiantly happy (so, for that matter, does LOUIS). I think we may safely assume that the small blanketed bundle in RACHEL'S arms is GAGE. 
b.) LOUIS, bare to the waist, is tubbing a two-month-old GAGE in a baby-tub. He's laughing. The infant looks confused but calm. 
c.) The whole family by the Christmas tree, following an orgy of present-opening. ELLIE, about five, has a doll in each hand. LOUIS and RACHEL are in pajamas. GAGE, about five months, is lying in a drift of wrapping paper. He looks confused but calm. 
d.) A child's sneaker lying in the road. It's splashed with blood. 
e.) GAGE--he's about nine months old in this snap--is propped up in the angle of a sofa. There's a big white rabbit in his lap. GAGE looks c. but c. 
f.) ELLIE and GAGE, bundled up against the Chicago winter. ELLIE is pulling a child's chair-sled. GAGE is propped up in the chair. He's about eleven months old in this snap. He's laughing. 
g.) The Orinco tanker, overturned on the far side of Route 9. 
h.) This one was taken at Gage's first birthday party. He's wearing a party-hat and looking at a birthday cake with a single candle on it while LOUIS kisses one cheek and RACHEL kisses the other. 
i.) LOUIS, in the road. He's holding GAGE'S jumper, which is torn, blood-soaked, and inside out. LOUIS is looking up toward the sky and screaming. 
j.) Here is a full-face studio portrait of GAGE. He is smiling at us, heartbreakingly lovely. CAMERA HOLDS ON THIS while: 
JUD (voice) Sedative finally took hold. She's asleep. 
INT.  THE KITCHEN TABLE, WITH LOUIS 
He's holding the studio portrait in his hands and looking at it fixedly. The other photos (the good ones, that is; not the screamers--those, we may assume, exist only in LOUIS'S tortured memory) are scattered on the table. We only saw a few; there are actually hundreds. 
LOUIS puts the photo down as JUD comes in and crosses to the fridge. LOUIS'S nose is badly swelled. He also has a black eye. 
JUD gets a couple of beers and comes back toward the table. 
JUD Your father-in-law packs a wallop, for an old guy. He and his wife gone back to Chicago? 
LOUIS No...squatting out there at the Holiday Inn like a couple of vultures. He really thinks Rachel's going to go back with them. Her and Ellie. 
JUD Louis-- 
The swing door opens. They look toward: 
INT.  ELLIE 
She looks dazed and shocked. There are brown circles under her eyes, but otherwise her complexion is much too white. She's wearing fuzzy pj's. She's carrying the picture of her pulling GAGE on the sled. 
INT.  JUD AND LOUIS, AT THE TABLE 
ELLIE (coming to the table) I want to go back to my own room. I can't sleep with mommy. She keeps stealing the covers. 
JUD What you got there, Ellie? 
At first she doesn't want to show him, but JUD is very kind. 
JUD (studying it) Why that's real nice...you pullin' him on a sled. Bet he liked that, didn't he? 
ELLIE nods. She is starting to cry. JUD is also leaking at the eyes. 
ELLIE (crying) I used to pull 'im a lot. 
LOUIS, looking down at his hands, nods. 
ELLIE I'm going to carry this picture, Mr. Crandall, until God lets Gage come back. 
JUD reacts violently. And LOUIS looks up, dully curious...but hasn't the thought already passed through LOUIS'S mind? Yes--I think it has. 
JUD Ellie...God doesn't do things like that. I know you loved y'brother, but-- 
ELLIE He can if He wants to. He can do anything, just like Inspector Gadget on TV. But I have to keep things ready for him, that's what I think. I've got his picture and I'm going to sit in his chair-- 
LOUIS Ellie-- 
ELLIE And I'm going to eat his breakfast cereal, too, even though it tastes like boogers. And...and... 
She bursts into tears. 
JUD Louis, take care of your little girl...she needs you. 
INT.  LOUIS, CU 
His face is stricken. 
INT.  ELLIE'S BEDROOM  NIGHT 
LOUIS comes in with ELLIE in his arms. He puts her gently into her bed and pulls the covers up. She's already mostly asleep. 
EXT.  THE REAR OF THE HEARSE/SEPIA 
The doors close. The hearse pulls away. THE CAMERA PANS TO BILL BATERMAN, who stands staring balefully after it and mopping his brow. 
JUD (v-o continues) He wasn't able to get to the bottom of the truth, Louis. 
INT.  THE CREED KITCHEN, WITH LOUIS AND JUD  NIGHT 
LOUIS is now sitting down, drinking a beer, staring at JUD. 
LOUIS I'll bite--what's the bottom of the truth, Jud? 
JUD Why...that sometimes dead is better. That's all. Sometimes dead is better. 
LOUIS (bitter) Tell that to my wife and little girl. 
JUD It ain't your wife and little girl that's got me worried, Louis. 
EXT.  THE LUDLOW CEMETARY/SEPIA  DUSK 
We're featuring a fresh grave...that of TIMMY BATERMAN. A truck, showing only parking lights, turns into the graveyard and drives slowly up to it. It stops, and BILL BATERMAN gets out. HE looks at the grave and then goes to the back of his truck. 
JUD (voice-over) Timmy was buried on July 22nd, as I remember. 
EXT.  BILL BATERMAN AT THE BACK OF HIS TRUCK/SEPIA  DUSK 
He reaches in...and brings out a pick and shovel. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT.  MARGIE WASHBURN, ON HER PORCH/SEPIA  DAY 
She's a middle-aged woman dressed in mid-forties style. She's got a rug-beater in one hand; the other is up to her eyes to shade the sun. She's staring at something, horrified. 
JUD (v-o continues) It was four or five days later when... 
EXT.  A COUNTRY DIRT ROAD, WITH TIMMY BATERMAN/SEPIA  DAY 
A young man dressed in jeans and a plaid shirt is shambling up the road. His eyes are vacant. His shirt is half untucked. His hair is sticking up in a wild crow's-nest thatch. There is an ugly mess of healed scars on his neck and one side of his face. I think one of his ears may be gone--torn off in the accident. 
JUD (v-o continues) ...Margie Washburn seen him walking up the road toward Yorkie's Livery. 
EXT.  MARGIE/SEPIA 
She's screaming--we hear her faintly. 
EXT.  TIMMY/SEPIA 
He turns toward her and we see a green light like the St. Elmo's fire in the Little God Swamp glow dimly deep in his eyes. He grins at MARGIE. 
EXT.  IN FRONT OF THE LUDLOW TOWN OFFICES, WITH MARGIE/SEPIA 
She hesitates for a moment or two and then walks up toward the door. 
JUD (v.o.) Lots of people saw Timmy Baterman walking back and forth between the home place and the town line. But it was Margie... 
INT.  THE TOWN OFFICES, WITH MARGIE/SEPIA 
She's in a hallway in front of a door with LUDLOW SELECTMEN printed on the frosted glass. After a moment she opens it and goes in. 
JUD (v.o. continues) ...who finally got up enough guts to talk to the town fathers about it. She knew it had to be stopped, Louis. 
INT.  THE SELECTMEN'S OFFICE/SEPIA 
MARGIE and four men are grouped around a desk. She's talking; they're listening. THE CAMERA LAZILY PANS the four men--one, of course, is JUD as a YOUNG MAN. 
JUD (v.o. continues) She knew it was an abomination. George Anderson, the town postmaster, was there...and Alan Purinton...Hannibal Benson...and me. I was there. 
EXT.  THE BATERMAN PLACE/SEPIA  SUNSET 
It's a ramshackle old farm which looks remarkably like the estate of that gentleman farmer Jordy Verrill. 
An old Ford pulls into the driveway, and the four men get out. 
SOUND BLEEDS IN: Most of all the SOUND OF THE CRICKETS. 
They go to the door, and JUD is wordlessly elected as the prime honcho. He knocks. No answer. Again. No answer. 
SOUND: Crazy laughter. 
BILL BATERMAN (voice) Stop that, Timmy! 
The four men look at each other. 
JUD Come on. 
They start around to the back. 
EXT.  THE BACK YARD, WITH BILL AND TIMMY/SEPIA 
TIMMY BATERMAN is staring directly into the setting sun, his eyes glowing with green fire. He's laughing like Goofy gone insane. BILL, scared, is trying to make him stop, to turn away from the sun. 
EXT.  THE BACK YARD, A NEW ANGLE/SEPIA 
The four men come around the side of the house. They freeze when they see BILL and TIMMY. 
ALAN Oh holy Jesus lookit that. 
BILL whirls around and sees them. 
BILL You men get out of here! 
JUD I heard your boy was killed down Georgia. 
BILL (agitated) That was a mistake! 
HANNIBAL Was it? 
BILL You see him standing there, don't you? Now get out! Get the Christ off my land! 
Now TIMMY turns around and comes shambling forward. 
TIMMY (laughing) Ge ow! Ge Cwise off eye an! 
GEORGE (revolted) Oh Jesus, Jud! He's dead! I can smell him! 
BILL He ain't dead! Give him a day or two and he'll be fine! Don't you say that! 
JUD Bill, this ain't right--you can see that yourself-- 
BILL (screaming) GET OUT! YOU HEAR? GET OUT!!! 
EXT.  TIMMY BATERMAN/SEPIA 
RACHEL Oh Louis, I just don't know about this-- 
LOUIS I told you last night--this can be the start of patching things up with your folks. If something good doesn't come of Gage's death, I think I'll go crazy. 
RACHEL Louis, are you sure? 
LOUIS I'm sure. 
INT.  THE GOLDMANS, WITH ELLIE 
ELLIE I don't want to go to Chicago, Gramma Dory. 
DORY Why not, darling? 
ELLIE I had a bad dream last night. A nightmare. 
IRWIN (kindly) About what? 
ELLIE About Daddy. (Pause) And Gage. 
DORY and IRWIN exchange a knowing, sad glance over the child's head. 
ELLIE And someone named Paxcow. 
INT.  RACHEL AND LOUIS 
LOUIS guides her to the jetway. 
LOUIS Come on, you guys--before you miss the boat. 
He kisses DORY. IRWIN hugs him. 
IRWIN Louis, I am sorry. What can I say? That I lost my mind? It's the truth, but no good excuse. 
LOUIS (hugs him back) We all lost our minds, Irwin. 
LOUIS kisses RACHEL. Then he kneels and hugs ELLIE. 
LOUIS Be good to your mother, darlin'. She needs you. 
ELLIE Come with us, daddy. Please come with us! 
LOUIS I'll be there in three days--four at the most. I've got to get the electricity shut off and square things with your school so the truant officer ain't after you, and-- 
INT.  ELLIE, CU 
ELLIE (crying) Please, daddy! I'm scared! 
INT.  LOUIS AND ELLIE 
LOUIS Of what? 
ELLIE (crying harder) I don't know. 
LOUIS (great emphasis) Everything's going to be all right, Ellie. Now go on--get aboard. 
ELLIE Do you swear? 
LOUIS I swear. 
The Voice of Authority has spoken. We can tell by ELLIE'S face that while things are still not all right, they are a little better. She joins her mother. 
The four of them--RACHEL, ELLIE, and THE GOLDMANS--start down the jetway. ELLIE looks back once, as if begging him to come...and then they're gone. 
INT.  LOUIS, CU 
LOUIS'S face changes. Now it is a stony and contemplative face. Not, when you get right down to it, a very nice face. 
He turns and strides away. 
INT.  THE AIRPORT PARKING LOT, WITH LOUIS 
The family station wagon is in the f.g. We hear the SOUND OF JET ENGINES, and as LOUIS reaches the wagon he turns and watches: 
EXT.  THE TERMINAL,, LOUIS'S POV 
From behind it a United Airlines jet lifts into view and banks away. 
EXT.  LOUIS, IN THE PARKING LOT 
Face set, he gets into the wagon and drives away. 
EXT.  ROUTE 15 IN BREWER 
The CREEDmobile pulls up across from the Brewer Tru-Value Hardware and LOUIS crosses to it. 
INT.  THE HARDWARE STORE COUNTER, CU 
On it: A six-cell flashlight, Duracell D-batteries, a pick, a shovel, and a nylon drop-sheet in cellophane packaging. Now the CLERK'S hands come into the frame and drop a pair of heavy work- gloves into the pile. 
INT.  LOUIS AND CLERK (SMALL PUN, HEE-HEE) 
CLERK Anything else for you today? 
LOUIS (after a look) I think we got it all. 
The CLERK starts to ring things up. 
CLERK Looks like heavy work. 
LOUIS It could be. 
The quality of LOUIS'S reply is somehow unnatural. The CLERK looks at him, momentarily unsure and uncertain. Then he starts ringing things up again. 
INT.  A UNITED JETLINER, WITH ELLIE AND RACHEL 
ELLIE is in the window-seat, asleep. RACHEL is holding a paperback but not reading it. Her eyes are red. She's looking into space. 
CAMERA DRIFTS TO ELLIE. Her sleep is not easy. Her head turns from side to side, as if in negation. She becomes steadily more upset. She's starting to mutter. Suddenly her eyes flare open and she screams. 
INT.  JETLINER, SLIGHTLY WIDER 
We can see the GOLDMANS in the seats behind the CREEDS. They are startled. So are other passengers. A stewardess comes running. 
ELLIE Paxcow says it's almost too late! 
RACHEL Ellie...Ellie...what... 
ELLIE Paxcow says it's almost too late! We have to go back! Paxcow says it's almost too late! 
EXT.  LUDLOW CEMETARY  DAY 
The CREED wagon turns in and drives up one of the lanes. It stops and LOUIS gets out. 
Her SEATMATE looks at her a bit strangely. 
EXT.  THE GRAVEYARD, WITH LOUIS 
He's got the bundle containing his son and the duffle-bag with the tools. He runs bent over. He reaches the wall and there's the SOUND of another motor. He crouches at the base of the wall. 
EXT.  THE ROAD 
Here comes that same police car. The spotlight runs along the wall. 
EXT.  LOUIS 
Crouching against his side of the wall and sweating. 
EXT.  THE POLICE CAR 
It stops. The COP gets out. He walks slowly toward the wall. 
EXT.  LOUIS 
Crouched. Now we see the COP looking over the top. If he looks down...but he doesn't. Instead he turns around so we see his back. LOUIS looks up, miserably scared, pouring sweat. 
Silence. Then: SOUND of the cop taking a whiz. 
EXT.  THE COP 
Ah! Relief. SOUND of his fly being zipped. He looks back at the cemetery for a moment. 
COP I ain't afraid of no ghost. 
He walks back to his cruiser, gets in, and hauls ass. 
EXT.  LOUIS, BEHIND THE WALL 
He collapses with relief. Then he gets up and looks cautiously over the wall. Nothing there but his car, parked a little way down on the other side of the road. 
He tosses the duffle bag over the top of the wall. He puts the canvas roll containing GAGE on top of the wall. Then he vaults over. 
EXT.  THE STREET SIDE OF THE WALL, WITH LOUIS 
He takes the roll, gets the duffle bag hooked over his shoulder by the string, and runs across the road like a soldier crossing enemy territory. He goes to the rear of the wagon. 
EXT.  THE REAR OF THE WAGON, WITH LOUIS 
He puts the body down. He feels in his pocket for his keys. No keys. Mild consternation. He looks around, feeling exposed. The other pocket. Still no keys. More consternation. He begins to hunt feverishly through his pockets. Maybe in his jacket? Nope. 
SOUND: An approaching car. 
EXT.  PASSING CAR 
A civilian--not the ubiquitous cop. 
EXT.  LOUIS 
He turns his pockets out, spilling change everywhere. Nothing. Suddenly a little light goes on in his eyes. He goes to the driver's side of the car and looks in at: 
INT.  IGNITION, LOUIS'S POV 
The keys are in the switch. 
EXT.  LOUIS 
He snatches the keys and returns to the back of the wagon. He uses the key to open the doorgate. He puts GAGE'S body in gently, then the duffle bag. He closes the doorgate and returns to the front of the car. He opens the driver's door and freezes. 
LOUIS returns to the rear, gets his keys from the doorgate, comes back to the front, gets in, and drives away. 
INT.  A JETWAY AT LOGAN INTERNATIONAL 
People are debarking into the gate area. Through them comes RACHEL, running fast, pushing some people, excusing herself incoherently. PASCOW is walking near her. 
PASCOW There's just time. If you run. 
Without looking at PASCOW, RACHEL takes off her shoes and runs. 
INT.  THE CONCOURSE, WITH RACHEL 
She's sprinting down the concourse--look out, Joanie Benoit! 
INT.  GATE 27, WITH FEMALE GATE AGENT AND PASCOW 
The FEMALE GATE AGENT is starting to close the jetway door. 
PASCOW Don't do that, babe. 
The GATE AGENT looks puzzled, as if she just had a thought (or maybe a gas pain). She stops closing the door. RACHEL runs into the area. She sees: 
INT./EXT.  THE JET PLANE, THROUGH THE GATE WINDOWS 
It is just starting to swing ponderously away from the jetway. 
INT.  RACHEL AND FEMALE GATE AGENT (PASCOW IS GONE) 
RACHEL Make it come back! 
FEMALE GATE AGENT I can't-- 
RACHEL bolts down the jetway. The GATE AGENT stares after her, and then runs for her stand, where we can see FLIGHT 61 and BANGOR on the slide-cards. She picks up her mike. 
EXT.  THE JETWAY  NIGHT 
RACHEL stands all alone at the end of it. 
AMPLIFIED SOUNDS OF JET ENGINES. 
RACHEL (screams) COME BACK, MOTHERFUCKER!! 
EXT.  THE JET, RACHEL'S POV 
It starts to swing back to pick her up. 
EXT.  RACHEL 
PASCOW appears behind her and puts a hand on her shoulder. 
PASCOW You're doing just fine. 
EXT.  JUD CRANDALL, ON HIS PORCH 
He's fast asleep with the tinny sound of Graham Parker coming out of his Walkman 'phones. 
SOUND: An approaching car. 
EXT.  THE CREED HOUSE 
He's scared almost to death. His face turns up...up...up. 
EXT.  THE WOODS--AND THE SHAPE, LOUIS'S POV 
It is vaguely manlike: perhaps sixty feet tall, perhaps eighty. We don't see it very well, nor do we have to--I'm not even sure it's flesh and blood. But there is a clear suggestion of a head. Now it turns and looks down...looks at LOUIS CREED. We see great yellow eyes the size of lighthouse lamps. 
It makes a huge GRUNTING SOUND...and then walks on. 
EXT.  LOUIS 
The SOUND OF FOOTFALLS is slowly diminishing. 
LOUIS It was the Wendigo. Dear God, I think the Wendigo just passed within sixty feet of me. 
Slowly he begins to walk again. 
EXT.  LOUIS, A NEW ANGLE 
In the extreme f.g. is a tree which has just fallen--it is no small tree, either, but a great big old fir. 
LOUIS approaches it. Stops. Looks at the tree. Looks down at: 
EXT.  THE FOREST FLOOR, LOUIS'S POV 
Here is a gigantic animal track--if it was full of water, LOUIS could swim in it. It looks like no animal track we've ever seen before. Three big claws at the end of it. 
EXT.  LOUIS 
Looks up again. His face is set and hard. 
LOUIS It doesn't matter. Come on, Gage. 
He starts to walk again. 
EXT.  THE MICMAC BURYING GROUND 
SOUND: The wind, lonesome and keening. 
THE CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY toward the slope, dreaming its way over those rocky cairns...most of them burst apart. 
SOUND: Tortured breathing. Panting. 
LOUIS toils his way into view, carrying his bundle. He reaches the top. He makes his way slowly into the burying ground. He stumbles over a rock. Falls down. Slowly gathers his things together and gets up again. He goes a little further and then stops and looks at: 
EXT.  A BROKEN CAIRN AND THE GRAVE BENEATH, LOUIS'S POV 
We can also see the shredded remains of a green garbage bag. 
EXT.  LOUIS 
He slowly kneels down. He puts the canvas tarp to one side and slowly takes the pick and shovel from the duffle bag. By now he is clearly a man approaching total exhaustion. 
EXT.  A COUNTRY ROAD, WITH AN ARIES K 
It tracks past THE CAMERA. 
INT.  THE ARIES K WITH RACHEL AND PASCOW 
Both of them look tense. RACHEL is bolt upright behind the wheel. Suddenly, BANG! as one of the tires blow. 
EXT.  THE ARIES K 
It goes skidding and slueing across the road, the rear tire half off the rim. IT climbs the curb and hits a tree. 
INT.  RACHEL 
She lurches forward, but she's wearing her seat-belt--good girl! She unbuckles it and gets out. 
EXT.  RACHEL 
She looks at the car, which now has quite a bit more wrong with it than just a scratch up the side. 
RACHEL slumps, near tears. LOUIS isn't the only one who's been through a lot tonight. 
RACHEL Now what? 
PASCOW comes from around the tree as RACHEL walks to the road, looking for cars, or something. He looks urgent and upset. 
PASCOW It's trying to stop you. Do you hear me? It's trying to stop you. 
RACHEL looks around uncertainly...a little afraid. As she scans the scene she looks at--and through--PASCOW. 
RACHEL Is anyone there? 
After a moment of silence she turns back to the road. Lights appear and brighten as a car approaches. RACHEL steps to the shoulder and after a moment she sticks out her thumb, surely for the first time in her life. 
The car sweeps by her without slowing. 
EXT.  GAGE'S CAIRN, CU 
LOUIS'S hands enter the shot and put a few more rocks on it. THE CAMERA PULLS BACK and we see him surveying his work. Beside him is the canvas tarp, now open and empty. 
Absently, LOUIS stuffs the tarp into the duffle bag (where his tools have also been replaced) and stands up with a wince. One hand goes to his lower back. He looks down at the cairn. 
LOUIS Come back to me, Gage. Come back to us. 
He turns away toward the stairs. 
EXT.  RACHEL, ON ROUTE 9 
She's walking down the shoulder with her high heels in one hand. Lights. An approaching car. She turns, thumb out. The car blasts by. 
RACHEL (shouts) MAY THE SEWERS OF RANGOON BACK UP IN YOUR BEDROOM, ASSHOLE! 
She starts walking again. 
EXT.  THE FIELD BESIDE LOUIS'S HOUSE 
LOUIS is moving down the path. As he passes the tire swing he pushes it, setting it in motion. 
INT.  THE GARAGE 
LOUIS slings the duffle bag wearily to one side and goes into the kitchen. CHURCH is under the table but LOUIS Doesn't see him. 
INT.  THE UPSTAIRS HALL 
SOUND of LOUIS slowly plodding up the stairs. He comes into view, dirty and exhausted, his hair hanging in his face. He walks down the hall toward the master bedroom. 
INT.  THE BEDROOM 
The clock on the bedtable reads 2:17 A.M. LOUIS falls face-first on the immaculate bedspread and lies still. 
In this shot we should note the closet door is standing open. 
LOUIS Hi, Church. Want some grub? 
He tosses the pork chop onto the grass. 
EXT.  CHURCH 
He hurries down the steps, goes to the chop, sniffs it, and starts to chow up. He looks up at: 
EXT.  LOUIS 
He is pulling on the rubber gloves. 
LOUIS Don't mind me. Eat it while you can. Eat all you want. 
EXT.  CHURCH 
He starts worrying the chop again. Smack-smack-smack. 
EXT.  ANGLE ON LOUIS AND CHURCH 
LOUIS Eat all you can...all you want... that's right...today's Thanksgiving day for cats, but only if they came back from the dead... 
He finishes with the gloves, gets one of the loaded syringes out of his breast pocket, holds it up, squirts a drop out of the tip, then moves toward CHURCH. 
CHURCH looks up. LOUIS stops moving. CHURCH starts eating again, and LOUIS starts moving again as soon as he does. All the time he talks to the cat in that soothing voice. He bends down...and grabs him. 
CHURCH begins to squall and fight. LOUIS holds onto him. He tries to get the syringe into the cat and CHURCH almost gets away. 
LOUIS No, you don't! 
EXT.  CHURCH, CU 
The syringe plunges into his haunch. 
EXT.  CHURCH AND LOUIS 
The needle is still dangling out of CHURCH'S haunch. The cat looks dazed. It tries to walk and falls over on its side. It tries to get up...and then falls over again. 
LOUIS Go on. Lie down. Play dead. Be dead. 
He walks to the porch steps and picks up the tote-bag. 
EXT.  THE TOTE-BAG, LOUIS'S POV 
Any doubt he might have allowed himself the luxury of having is erased by the initials--R.C., same as the cola. 
EXT.  LOUIS 
Twang! One of the few remaining strands of sanity has now parted. He looks back at: 
INT.  CHURCH, ON THE PATH, LOUIS'S POV 
Dead. 
EXT.  LOUIS 
He climbs the steps and goes onto the porch. 
EXT. LOUIS, ON THE PORCH 
He strips off the rubber gloves. He tosses them onto the table beside JUD'S beer-cans as he goes inside. 
INT.  THE FOYER OF THE CRANDALL HOME, WITH LOUIS 
It's dark in here, and spooky. 
LOUIS Rachel? (Pause) Jud? (Longer pause) Gage? 
No answer. He looks down and sees: 
INT.  A SHOE, LOUIS'S POV 
One of RACHEL'S shoes. It lies by the foot of the stairs. 
INT.  LOUIS 
He goes over and picks up the shoe. It's a three-quarter heel, and it's pretty badly scuffed. RACHEL, after all, did some pretty hard travelling to get here. 
There's a spot of blood on it. 
SOUND: A low giggle. 
LOUIS looks up: 
INT.  THE STAIRS, LOUIS'S POV 
Mighty dark. Mighty shadowy. 
SOUND: Another giggle. 
INT.  LOUIS, AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS 
LOUIS Gage? 
INT.  THE STAIRS 
GAGE (voice) Let's play, daddy! Let's play hide and go seek! 
INT.  LOUIS 
He takes one of the loaded syringes from his pocket. 
LOUIS All right, Gage...let's. 
He begins to climb the stairs. 
INT.  UPSTAIRS, WITH LOUIS 
LOUIS arrives on the landing. We begin the nerve-wracking business of checking rooms. First, the bathroom...and the shower curtain is of course pulled. LOUIS yanks it back. Nothing. 
He checks the linen closet. Nothing. Goes back to the hall. Looks down it. He walks slowly along it. He checks one room. It's a guest room. Shadowy and empty. 
Down the hall. A closet door. A bag falls off the top shelf, and a bunch of ceramics inside it SHATTER LOUDLY. LOUIS flinches back. 
Down the hall. Now he's at JUD'S room. He goes in. 
INT.  JUD'S ROOM, WITH LOUIS 
He checks the closet. No go. He steps around the bed and sees: 
INT.  THE FLOOR, LOUIS'S POV 
A bloodstain.

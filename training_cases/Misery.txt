Misery - by William Goldman 
"MISERY" 
by 
William Goldman 
Based on the Novel by 
Stephen King 
FADE IN ON: 
A SINGLE CIGARETTE. A MATCH. A HOTEL ICE BUCKET that holds a bottle of champagne. The cigarette is unlit. The match is of the kitchen variety. The champagne, unopened, is Dom Perignon. There is only one sound at first: a strong WIND-- 
--now another sound, sharper--a sudden burst of TYPING as we 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL 
PAUL SHELDON typing at a table in his hotel suite. It's really a cabin that's part of a lodge. Not an ornate place. Western themed. 
He is framed by a window looking out at some gorgeous mountains. It's afternoon. The sky is grey. Snow is scattered along the ground. We're out west somewhere. The WIND grows stronger--there could be a storm. 
PAUL pays no attention to what's going on outside as he continues to type. 
He's the hero of what follows. Forty-two, he's got a good face, one with a certain mileage to it. We are not, in other words, looking at a virgin. He's been a novelist for eighteen years and for half that time, the most recent half, a remarkably successful one. 
He pauses for a moment, intently, as if trying to stare a hole in the paper. Now his fingers fly, and there's another burst of TYPING. He studies what he's written, then-- 
CUT TO: 
THE PAPER, as he rolls it out of the machine, puts it on the table, prints, in almost childlike letters, these words: 
THE END 
CUT TO: 
A PILE OF MANUSCRIPT at the rear of the table. He puts this last page on, gets it straight and in order, hoists it up, folds it to his chest, the entire manuscript--hundreds of pages. 
CUT TO: 
PAUL, as he holds his book to him. He is, just for a brief moment, moved. 
CUT TO: 
A SUITCASE across the room. PAUL goes to it, opens it and pulls something out from inside: a battered red leather briefcase. Now he takes his manuscript, carefully opens the briefcase, gently puts the manuscript inside. He closes it, and the way he handles it, he might almost be handling a child. Now he crosses over, opens the champagne, pours himself a single glass, lights the one cigarette with the lone match-- there is a distinct feeling of ritual about this. He inhales deeply, makes a toasting gesture, then drinks, smokes, smiles. 
HOLD BRIEFLY, then-- 
CUT TO: 
LODGE - DAY 
PAUL--exiting his cabin. He stops, makes a snowball, throws it, hitting a sign. 
PAUL Still got it. 
He throws a suitcase into the trunk of his '65 MUSTANG and, holding his leather case, he hops into the car and drives away. 
CUT TO: 
A SIGN that reads "Silver Creek Lodge." Behind the sign is the hotel itself--old, desolate. Now the '65 Mustang comes out of the garage, guns ahead toward the sign. As "Shotgun" by Jr. Walker and the Allstars starts, he heads off into the mountains. 
CUT TO: 
THE SKY. Gun-metal grey. The clouds seem pregnant with snow. 
CUT TO: 
PAUL, driving the Mustang, the battered briefcase on the seat beside him. 
CUT TO: 
THE ROAD AHEAD. Little dainty flakes of snow are suddenly visible. 
CUT TO: 
THE CAR, going into a curve and 
CUT TO: 
PAUL, driving, and as he comes out of the curve, a stunned look hits his face as we 
CUT TO: 
THE ROAD AHEAD--and here it comes--a mountain storm; it's as if the top has been pulled off the sky and with no warning whatsoever, we're into a blizzard and 
CUT TO: 
CUT TO: 
THE AREA WHERE THE WRECK IS--AS SEEN FROM THE ROAD. The car is barely visible as the snow begins to cover it. 
CUT TO: 
THE WRECK from outside, and we're close to it now, with the snow coming down ever harder--already bits of the car are covered in white. 
CAMERA MOVES IN TO 
PAUL. He's inside and doing his best to fight is, but his consciousness is going. He tries to keep his eyes open but they're slits. 
Slowly, he manages to reach out with his left arm for his briefcase-- 
--and he clutches it to his battered body. The MUSIC continues on. 
But PAUL is far from listening. His eyes flutter, flutter again. Now they're starting to close. 
The man is dying. 
Motionless, he still clutches the battered briefcase. 
HOLD ON THE CASE. Then-- 
DISSOLVE TO: 
The BRIEFCASE in Paul's hands as he sits at a desk. 
SINDELL (O.S.) What's that? 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL 
We are in New York City in the office of Paul's literary agent, MARCIA SINDELL. The walls of the large room are absolutely crammed with book and movie posters, in English and all other kinds of other languages, all of them featuring the character of MISERY CHASTAIN, a perfectly beautiful woman. Misery's Challenge, Misery's Triumph--eight of them. All written by Paul Sheldon. 
CUT TO: 
PAUL, lifting up the battered briefcase--maybe when new it cost two bucks, but he treats it like gold. 
PAUL An old friend. I was rummaging through a closet and it was just sitting there. Like it was waiting for me. 
CUT TO: 
SINDELL (searching for a compliment) It's... it's nice, Paul. It's got... character. 
CUT TO: 
THE TWO OF THEM 
PAUL When I wrote my first book, I used to carry it around in this while I was looking for a publisher. That was a good book, Marcia. I was a writer then. 
SINDELL You're still a writer. 
PAUL I haven't been a writer since I got into the Misery business-- 
SINDELL (holding up the cover art of MISERY'S CHILD) Not a bad business. This thing would still be growing, too. The first printing order on Misery's Child was the most ever--over a million. 
PAUL Marcia, please. 
SINDELL No, no. Misery Chastain put braces on your daughter's teeth and is putting her through college, bought you two houses and floor seats to the Knick games and what thanks does she get? You go and kill her. 
PAUL Marcia, you know I started "Misery" on a lark. Do I look like a guy who writes romance novels? Do I sound like Danielle Steel? It was a one- time shot and we got lucky. I never meant it to become my life. And if I hadn't gotten rid of her now, I'd have ended up writing her forever. (touches his briefcase) For the first time in fifteen years, I think I'm really onto something here. 
SINDELL I'm glad to hear that, Paul, I really am. But you have to know--when your fans find out that you killed off their favorite heroine, they're not going to say, "Ooh, good, Paul Sheldon can finally write what we've always wanted: An esoteric, semi- autobiographical character study. 
PAUL (passionately) Marcia, why are you doing this to me? Don't you know I'm scared enough? Don't you think I remember how nobody gave a shit about my first books? You think I'm dying to go back to shouting in the wilderness? (beat) I'm doing this because I have to. (Marcia is stopped) Now, I'm leaving for Colorado to try to finish this and I want your good thoughts--because if I can make it work ... (beat) I might just have something that I want on my tombstone. 
On the word "tombstone" 
CUT TO: 
PAUL'S TOMBSTONE--the upside down car with the blizzard coming gale-force and his motionless body trapped inside the car. 
The WIND screams. PAUL'S EYES flutter, then close. 
Hold 
Keep holding as-- 
Suddenly there's a new sound as a crowbar SCRATCHES at the door-- 
-- nd now the door is ripped open as we 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL 
A BUNDLED-UP FIGURE gently beginning to pull PAUL and the case from the car. For a moment, it's hard to tell if it's a man or woman-- 
--not to let the cat out of the bag or anything, but it is, very much, a woman. Her name is ANNIE WILKES and she is close to Paul's age. She is in many ways a remarkable creature. Strong, self-sufficient, passionate in her likes and dislikes, loves and hates. 
CUT TO: 
ANNIE (smiles) Don't move now--wouldn't want to hurt this neck-- (shaving away) Well, the other afternoon I was on my way home, and there you were, leaving the Lodge, and I wondered why a literary genius would go for a drive when there was a big storm coming. 
PAUL I didn't know it was going to be a big storm. 
ANNIE Lucky for you, I did. (pauses) Lucky for me too. Because now you're alive and you can write more books. Oh, Paul, I've read everything of Yours, but the Misery novels... 
CUT TO: 
ANNIE: CLOSE UP 
ANNIE I know them all by heart, Paul, all eight of them. I love them so. 
CUT TO: 
PAUL, looking at her. There's something terribly touching about her now. 
PAUL You're very kind... 
ANNIE And you're very brilliant, and you must be a good man, or you could never have created such a wondrous, loving creature as Misery Chastain. (runs her fingers over his cheek) Like a baby. (smiles) All done. (starts to dab away the last bits of soap) 
ANNIE starts cleaning up. 
PAUL When do you think the phone lines'll be back up? I have to call my daughter, and I should call New York and let my agent know I'm breathing. 
ANNIE It shouldn't be too much longer. (gently) Once the roads are open, the lines'll be up in no time. If you give me their numbers, I'll keep trying them for you. (suddenly almost embarrassed) Could I ask you a favor? (Paul nods) I noticed in your case there was a new Paul Sheldon book and... (hesitant) and I wondered if maybe... (her voice trails off) 
PAUL You want to read it? 
ANNIE (quietly) If you wouldn't mind. 
PAUL I have a hard and fast rule about who can read my stuff at this early stage--only my editor, my agent, and anyone who saves me from freezing to death in a car wreck. 
ANNIE (genuinely thrilled) You'll never realize what a rare treat you've given me. 
CUT TO: 
PAUL. His eyes close briefly, he grimaces. 
CUT TO: 
ANNIE, watching him, concerned. She glances at her watch. 
ANNIE Boy, it's like clockwork, the way your pain comes--I'll get you your Novril, Paul. Forgive me for prattling away and making you feel all oogy. 
She turns and goes out of the room. 
CUT TO: 
PAUL, watching her. 
ANNIE What's your new book called? 
PAUL I don't have a title yet. 
ANNIE What's it about? 
PAUL (fast) It's crazy, but I don't really know, I mean I haven't written anything but "Misery" for so long that--you read it you can tell me what you think it's about. Maybe you can come up with a title. 
ANNIE (in the doorway) Oh, like I could do that? 
CUT TO: 
THE MANAGER'S OFFICE AT THE SILVER CREEK LODGE 
Small, neat, one window--outside, snow covers all. 
BUSTER AND LIBBY, THE MANAGER, are going over books and records. Libby is an old guy, walks with a cane. 
LIBBY Nothing unusual about Mr. Sheldon's leaving, Buster--you can tell by the champagne. 
BUSTER Maybe you can, Libby. 
LIBBY No, see, he always ordered a bottle of Dom Perignon when he was ready to go. Then he'd pay up and be out the door. 
BUSTER No long-distance phone calls, Federal Express packages--anything at all out of the ordinary? 
LIBBY (head shake) I don't think Mr. Sheldon likes for things to be out of the ordinary. Considering who he is and all, famous and all, he doesn't have airs. Drives the same car out from New York each time--'65 Mustang--said it helps him think. He was always a good guest, never made a noise, never bothered a soul. Sure hope nothing happened to him. 
BUSTER So do I... 
LIBBY I'll bet that old Mustang's pulling into New York right now. 
BUSTER I'm sure you're right. 
But you can tell he's not sure at all as we 
CUT TO: 
A SPOON FILLED TO THE BRIM WITH BEEF BARLEY SOUP 
CUT TO: 
THE CAR. Suddenly, it goes into a little icy spin--she fights it back under control. 
CUT TO: 
INSIDE THE CAR 
BUSTER (suddenly) Stop--stop right here. 
VIRGINIA What? What is it? 
CUT TO: 
THE CAR, skidding, slowing, stopping. BOTH OF THEM get out, go to the edge of the road. Mountains of snow. Nothing much else visible. Then Buster points. 
BUSTER Look at that broken branch there... 
CUT TO: 
VIRGINIA, seeing it, unconvinced. 
VIRGINIA Could be the weight of the snow. 
BUSTER Could be--or a rotten branch or a mountain lion could have landed on it. Could be a lot of things. 
He steps off the road, starts down. 
CUT TO: 
VIRGINIA, watching him, worried--it's very slippery. 
CUT TO: 
BUSTER, graceful, in great shape, navigating down easily. 
CUT TO: 
THE TREE that the car ran into. BUSTER reaches it, studies it. 
CUT TO: 
VIRGINIA, staring out after him--she can't see him because the drop is both too steep and covered with trees and mounds of snow. 
VIRGINIA Anything down there? 
BUSTER'S VOICE (O.S.) Yeah. An enormous amount of snow. 
CUT TO: 
BUSTER. He's moved away from the tree now, going toward where the Mustang is buried. 
CUT TO: 
THE MOUND OF SNOW with the Mustang inside. 
CUT TO: 
BUSTER, making his way closer to it, closer, staring around. 
CUT TO: 
THE AREA. Nothing to be seen--everything is covered with mountains of snow. You could have a house down there and not be able to see it. Just glaring white. 
CUT TO: 
BUSTER, angry, frustrated, turning around and around and 
CUT TO: 
BUSTER from another angle, from behind the mound with the Mustang inside--and out of his sight, glistening in the sun, a bit of the door protrudes. But, of course, Buster can't see it. 
HOLD ON BUSTER, in a sour mood, staring around as the edge of the door continues to glisten. 
CUT TO: 
VIRGINIA, on the road as Buster makes his way back up, still ticked. 
VIRGINIA (they move to the car) You really think Sheldon's out there? 
BUSTER Hope not--if he is, he's dead. Let's go to the newspaper office. 
As they get in the car-- 
ANOTHER CAR DRIVING BY--it's Annie in her Jeep--neither she nor Buster notice each other. 
CUT TO: 
PAUL'S ROOM 
ANNIE I thought it was time you two should meet. Paul, say hello to my favorite beast in all the world, my sow, Misery. 
PAUL Misery? 
CUT TO: 
THE PIG, snorting around the room. 
CUT TO: 
PAUL AND ANNIE, watching it. 
ANNIE Yes. I told you I was your number- one fan. 
PAUL I'm getting to believe you. 
ANNIE This farm was getting kind of dreary, what with just the few cows and chickens and me-- (happy) But when I got Misery here, everything Changed--she just makes me smile so. 
PAUL She's a fine... uh... pig is what she is... 
ANNIE (scooping up the pig, holding it tight as she stands by Paul) I'm on page three-hundred now, Paul, and it's better than perfect--it's divine. What's the ceiling that dago painted? 
PAUL The Sistine Chapel? 
ANNIE Yeah, that and Misery's Child--those are the only two divine things ever in this world... 
PAUL watches as the pig skitters out of the room with ANNIE in pursuit, happily imitating the pig. 
ANNIE Woink! Whoink! Whuh-Whuh-WHOINK! 
CUT TO: 
PAUL staring after them--what the hell was that? 
CUT TO: 
THE WINDOW. DUSK. 
ANNIE'S VOICE is heard softly. 
ANNIE When my husband left me... I wasn't prepared, it wasn't an easy time... 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL 
ANNIE, standing at the window, her back to the room. 
In bed, PAUL is dealing with a bedpan, peeing. 
ANNIE For a while I thought I might go crazy. 
PAUL I know how that can be. 
ANNIE I don't know about you, but what I did to get through it was I dove into work--days, nights--night shifts can be lonely at a hospital. I did a lot of reading. That was hen I first discovered Misery. She made me so happy. She made me forget all my problems. (She smiles now) 'Course, I suppose you had a little something to do with that too. 
There is a peeing sound. 
PAUL Yeah, well... 
He is embarrassed. 
ANNIE (She isn't) I just kept reading them over and over. I know when I finish this one-- and I've only got two chapters to go-- I'll just turn right to the front page and start reading it again. 
PAUL I'm... 
ANNIE (She turns around, moves to the bed) Done? 
PAUL Yeah, thanks. 
ANNIE No problem. 
As she takes the bedpan... 
ANNIE Don't get me wrong. I'm not against marriage per se. But it would take a pretty special guy to make me want to go down the aisle again. 
PAUL Well, it's not something you should enter into lightly. 
ANNIE It boils down to respect. People just don't respect the institution of marriage any more. They have no sense of real commitment. 
CUT TO: 
PAUL, attempting to smile. There is not much he can say to this. 
ANNIE I'd love to stay here and chat, but I'm right at the end and I gotta find out what happens. 
PAUL Well, I hope you like it. 
ANNIE Of course I'll like it. Misery's about to have her child. What's it gonna be, a boy or a girl? Ooh, don't tell me. 
With that, she exits. 
--young, Oriental, female, male, pretty, sad, black, not so pretty, happy, white, old--what we HEAR is this: 
"...You've changed my life..." 
"...I'm your number one fan..." 
"...I'm a really big fan of yours..." 
"...I'm your biggest fan..." 
"...Don't ever stop writing those Misery books..." 
"...I've read all your books, but the Misery's... well..." 
"...I'm your number one fan..." 
"...You've given me such pleasure..." 
"...I feel like you're writing just for me..." 
And now, it gets kicked up in speed and all goes faster, many times overlapping. 
"...I love you... I'm your number one fan... I'm your biggest fan... We love you... number one... love you... biggest... love you... number one... number one... you poor dear thing..." 
This last was said by Annie, out of focus, and for a moment, she stays that way-- 
CUT TO: 
THE ROOM, AS IT SNAPS BACK INTO FOCUS--ANNIE is standing by the bed. It is dusk. 
She wears a dark blue dress and a hat with a sprig of flowers. Her eyes are bright and vivacious--the fact is, this is the prettiest ANNIE WILKES has ever looked. 
ANNIE What are you doing on the floor? (crossing to the bed) It's my fault. If I'd had a proper hospital bed, this never would have happened. Here, let me help you back in. (She lifts him back into the bed, which causes considerable pain) I know this hurts, but it'll only take a few seconds. There you go. Comfy? 
PAUL (in pain) Perfect. 
ANNIE You're such a kidder. I have a big surprise for you. But first there's something you must do. 
PAUL I don't suppose I could have a little snack while I wait for the surprise? 
ANNIE I'll get you everything you want, but you must listen first. Sometimes my thinking is a little muddy, I accept that. It's why I couldn't remember all those things they were asking me on the witness stand in Denver. 
Now she turns, goes to the doorway, keeping on talking. She is never out of sight. 
ANNIE But this time I thought clearly. I asked God about you and God said "I delivered him unto you so that you may show him the way." 
PAUL Show me the way? 
ANNIE Yes. 
She exits and re-enters wheeling something toward his bed. It's a charcoal barbecue, the kind you use in summer for cooking hamburgers. She holds several items in her arms: a box of Diamond Blue Tip wooden matches, a can of lighter fluid. And most noticeably, Paul's manuscript. 
CUT TO: 
ANNIE AND PAUL. He watches, mute, as she takes off the grill, puts the manuscript into the barbecue itself where the charcoal goes, spritzes it with lighter fluid. The grill is close enough to the bed for him to reach out and drop a match. 
PAUL When I mentioned a snack, I was thinking more along the lines of a cheese and crackers kind of thing. 
CUT TO: 
ANNIE, looking at him. 
ANNIE Paul, this is no time for jokes. You must rid the world of this filth. 
She hands him the box of kitchen matches. 
PAUL You want me to burn my book? 
ANNIE (she nods) Yes. 
PAUL You want me to burn my book? 
ANNIE I know this may be difficult for you, but it's for the best. 
PAUL This isn't difficult, my agent's made dozens of copies. There's gonna be an auction on this, and every publishing house in New York is reading it now. So if you want me to burn it, fine. You're not ridding the world of anything. 
CUT TO: 
ANNIE, watching him. 
ANNIE (quietly) Then light the match, Paul. 
PAUL No big deal. 
ANNIE So you've indicated. Do it. 
CUT TO: 
THE MATCHES. PAUL'S HANDS are starting to tremble now. He can't do it. 
ANNIE taking  a step toward the window, stopping for a moment. The sound we're hearing is a motor. A HELICOPTER MOTOR. And it's getting louder. Annie goes to the window now, looks toward the sky as we 
CUT TO: 
A HELICOPTER flying along. 
CUT TO: 
INSIDE THE HELICOPTER 
BUSTER and a PILOT are in the machine. Buster has a pair of binoculars looped around his neck, a map rumpled in his lap. 
BUSTER (pointing out) That's the Steadman place up there. (The pilot nods. Buster points again) The only other place up here is the Wilkes farm. 
Another nod. The PILOT points down. BUSTER stares through the binoculars. 
WHAT HE SEES: ANNIE'S JEEP parked in front of her house. 
CUT TO: 
INSIDE THE HELICOPTER 
BUSTER That's no '65 Mustang. There's nothing else out this way--circle on back. 
As the pilot starts to change direction 
CUT TO: 
ANNIE at the window, watching, as the helicopter turns, starts off. 
CUT TO: 
PAUL, listening as the MOTOR sound recedes. 
CUT TO: 
ANNIE, staring out the window. 
ANNIE I do believe the winters are getting shorter and shorter every year. People say it has something to do with the ozone layer. What do you think? 
PAUL I don't know. 
ANNIE Yeah, well, it's a theory. Here's your Novril. (she wheels the barbecue to the door; stops) How does tuna casserole sound for dinner? 
PAUL Great. 
She exits. PAUL takes the two Novril, stares at them, then deliberately tucks them under his mattress. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
PAUL'S ROOM. NIGHT. 
As PAUL is finishing the last of his tuna casserole. There are two Novrils on his tray. We hear strains of TV GAME SHOW THEME MUSIC. These sounds are not surprising. Paul has heard them before. 
CUT TO: 
ANNIE'S ROOM. NIGHT. 
It is much smaller than Paul's and filled with religious bric-a-brac, pictures of Paul Sheldon, and a TV on a portable stand. Annie lies in bed, with an open bag of Cheetos resting on her stomach and a big quart-sized plastic bottle of Coke on the nightstand. As she munches away, she is heavily engrossed in her favorite TV show, "The Love Connection." As Chuck Woolery extracts the embarrassing details of a couple's romantic interlude, we 
CUT TO: 
Paul faintly hearing the sounds of the TV. He has now finished eating. He takes the two Novril from under the mattress. He then undoes the sheet, takes his fork and delicately pokes a hole in the mattress, then stuffs all four pills back into the hole. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
FARMHOUSE 
Coming up to dawn. 
CUT TO: 
PAUL'S DOOR slowly opening. 
CUT TO: 
PAUL, staring at  the door. 
CUT TO: 
WHEELS, seen from underneath the bed, being rolled around the foot of the bed. We realize PAUL is in a wheelchair with ANNIE pushing him. 
ANNIE See, isn't this nice? 
PAUL Great. I've always wanted to visit the other side of the room. 
ANNIE And look what I've got for you. An electric razor so you can shave yourself now. 
PAUL If I knew this was gonna be the surprise, you could've gotten me to burn all my books. 
ANNIE (looking at it) Well, it does smudge after all--isn't that fascinating? 
PAUL I thought you'd be interested. I'd like you to be in on everything, Annie. Not just the finished book, but how it's written. 
ANNIE Thank you for thinking of me. (She can be so charming when she wants) Anything else I can get while I'm in town? Any other crucial requirements that need satisfying? Would you like a tiny tape recorder? Or maybe a handmade set of writing slippers? 
PAUL No, just the paper will be fine. 
ANNIE (suddenly very agitated) Are you sure? 'Cause if you want, I'll bring back the whole store for you. 
PAUL Annie, what's the matter? 
ANNIE What's the matter? I'll tell you what's the matter. I go out of my way for you. I do everything to try and make you happy. I feed you, I clean you, I dress you. And what thanks do I get? "You bought the wrong paper, Annie. I can't write on this paper, Annie." Well, I'll get your stupid paper, but you just better start showing me a little more appreciation around here, Mister Man. 
With that, she throws the ream of paper in PAUL'S LAP, causing considerable pain. 
CUT TO: 
THE DOOR as she slams it shut, locks it, stomps off and 
CUT TO: 
THE WINDOW. Annie, in a parka, can be seen storming out in the direction where her Cherokee was parked. She gets in and drives off. 
CUT TO: 
PAUL. He heaves a sigh, reaches out toward his tortured knees, then drops his head. He sees something. 
CUT TO: 
BOBBY PIN on the floor. 
CUT TO: 
PAUL, as he moves toward the bobby pin. Or tries to. It's brutally hard for him. The chair moves half a foot. Stops. Paul strains again. Another half foot. Another. 
CUT TO: 
The BOBBY PIN. The wheelchair is beside it now. PAUL reaches down for it. Can't make it. Tries again. Can't. He takes a deep breath, forces himself to bend, ignoring the pain. The bobby pin is in his hands. 
CUT TO: 
PAUL, inserting the bobby pin into the keyhole, beginning to jimmy the lock. 
CUT TO: 
THE LOCK--it makes a SOUND--something has caught. 
CUT TO: 
PAUL, excited, trying to force the bobby pin and he's doing great--until it slips from his hands, falls to the floor again. 
PAUL (furious) Shit... 
CUT TO: 
THE BOBBY PIN. Paul reaches for it. The pain has him. He reaches again, involuntarily cries out. But he grabs it, clutches it tight. 
CUT TO: 
THE KEYHOLE. Paul is trying to jimmy the lock a second time. 
No luck. 
CUT TO: 
PAUL. In wild frustration. 
PAUL You've written how to do this--now do it! 
CUT TO: 
THE KEYHOLE. There is a loud CLICKING sound. 
CUT TO: 
THE DOOR as Paul turns the knob. The door opens a crack. 
PAUL (amazed) What do you know, it actually works. 
CUT TO: 
PAUL, trying to get out of the room--but it's a bitch because in order to get to the lock he had to move the wheelchair up to the door and in order to get out, he's got to maneuver it out of the way of the door and every turn of the chair's wheels is an effort for him. He works at it and works at it, but his energy is failing him. He's pale, perspiring. Finally he succeeds, barely forces his way into the hall. 
CUT TO: 
PAUL, in the hallway outside. He looks around for a phone. Doesn't see one. He wheels himself over to the front door, tries it. It's locked from the outside. 
PAUL What a surprise. 
PAUL, crying out in pain as he lands. He lies there for a moment. Little droplets of sweat are on his forehead now. He is hurting. 
He closes his eyes, gathering strength-- 
--and then slowly, very slowly, inch by inch, he moves his body across the floor toward the kitchen door. 
CUT TO: 
THE KITCHEN DOOR. It's still a long way away. 
CUT TO: 
PAUL, ignoring his pain, his awkwardness, making his body move. 
CUT TO: 
THE KITCHEN DOOR. Closer now. 
CUT TO: 
PAUL, growing pale, but he won't stop, and now the door is just ahead of him, and with his good arm he reaches out and up and grabs the doorknob-- 
CUT TO: 
THE KITCHEN DOOR. Locked solid. 
CUT TO: 
PAUL: CLOSE UP. The disappointment and anger is plain on his face. His arm drops. He lies still for a moment, panting from his effort. Then-- 
CUT TO: 
PAUL, and his eyes are wide for a moment. You can feel his wild excitement, as we 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL 
Sitting on the counter: A SET OF CARVING KNIVES sticking out of a slotted wooden block. 
They seem to be out of reach, but that doesn't stop him. He starts to crawl over to the counter. 
CUT TO: 
THE ROAD 
ANNIE is driving along in her Cherokee. She is heading home. 
CUT TO: 
THE KITCHEN 
Now at the counter, PAUL tries to pull himself up with his one good arm, but even though he is able to chin himself up to the top of the counter, he is still unable to reach the knives. He makes a desperate attempt which sends him crashing to the floor. 
As he starts to force his way up again--from outside there comes a sound--the motor of a car. 
CUT TO: 
OUTSIDE ANNIE'S 
ANNIE, driving up to the house. 
CUT TO: 
THE KITCHEN 
PAUL, throwing himself back to the floor, starting a wild crawl back across the kitchen toward the wheelchair and 
CUT TO: 
OUTSIDE ANNIE'S 
ANNIE, getting out of her Jeep and 
CUT TO: 
KITCHEN 
PAUL, crawling, crawling and 
CUT TO: 
OUTSIDE ANNIE'S 
ANNIE, walking around to the back of the Jeep and 
CUT TO: 
KITCHEN 
PAUL, scrambling wildly up into his wheelchair, starting to get it turned and 
CUT TO: 
ANNIE. She stares a moment more, then turns, starts for the door. 
ANNIE (upset) It just breaks my heart to see you like this... 
CUT TO: 
PAUL watching, and the instant she is out the door in the hallway, he stuffs the Novril into his pants. 
ANNIE (O.S.) (coming closer) I've done a lot of thinking on the drive... 
CUT TO: 
ANNIE, entering the room, the Novril in her hand. She is genuinely contrite. 
ANNIE ...and I'm absolutely convinced that the main reason I've never been more popular is because of my temper. You must be so mad at me. The truth now. 
She hands him the pills. And rolls him over to the bed. 
PAUL Well, I don't  hold grudges. After all, who doesn't let off a little steam once in a while. 
CUT TO: 
PAUL putting the pills in his mouth, as she picks him up from the chair and puts him gently down in bed. 
ANNIE My genius needs his rest before he writes. 
She hands him a pad and pencil. 
ANNIE Here, in case you think of any ideas. 
PAUL Yeah, well I wouldn't expect too much. 
ANNIE Don't be silly. You'll be brilliant. Think of me as your inspiration. 
CUT TO: 
THE DOORWAY, as ANNIE starts to it. 
ANNIE I have faith in you... (beat) ...my darling... 
On that she turns--for the first time, a coquettish look comes to her face. 
ANNIE Catch this-- (she throws him a kiss--it's grotesque) --ummmm-wahhhh. 
CUT TO: 
PAUL, summoning up all his courage, as he mimes catching it and forces a smile on. She waves, closes the door. 
HOLD ON PAUL. The smile dies. He reaches in and pulls the two Novril capsules out of his mouth. Now-- 
CUT TO: 
THE SOUND OF A HELICOPTER 
CUT TO: 
INSIDE THE HELICOPTER 
BUSTER AND PILOT flying along. Buster is all bundled up as he stares out, using the binoculars... 
CUT TO: 
SOMETHING SHINY reflecting the sun. 
HOLD AS IT ALMOST BLINDS US--we're looking at the part of Paul's Mustang that was revealed by the snow when Buster almost found the car. 
BUSTER (to Pilot) Walter, we could be skipping lunch today. 
CUT TO: 
CRASH SITE 
Paul's car being hoisted by chains from the ground and, as it starts to rise up into the afternoon air... 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL 
THE AREA BY THE CAR--BUSTER is there and a bunch of STATE POLICEMEN and various MEDIA PEOPLE are there--Buster stands with the STATE POLICE CHIEF watching as the car is hoisted via derrick; the sound of the powerful MOTOR lifting the car is enormous and as the car keeps rising higher and higher and PEOPLE take pictures and stare and 
CUT TO: 
THE STATE POLICE CHIEF is addressing maybe a dozen REPORTERS. It's very cold. BUSTER stands slightly away from the group. 
STATE POLICE CHIEF The presumption must now be that Paul Sheldon is dead. We know he somehow crawled out of his car. But we have been unable to locate his body in the vicinity of the crash. We also know if anyone had found him, they would have taken him to an area hospital. His body is undoubtedly out there buried somewhere in the snow. We'll find him after the first thaw--unless the animals have gotten to him first. (beat) I'll take questions. 
After the first sentence, a very cold and very unhappy BUSTER leaves the gathering. 
CUT TO: 
CUT TO: 
PAUL. He closes his eyes briefly, mutters something, kind of nods, opens his eyes, grabs for another piece of paper, rolls it in and starts mechanically to type. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
A NEW PIECE OF PAPER with the words "Chapter Two" and a half paragraph of writing as we 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL 
PAUL WORKING in his room. ANNIE  enters, the first pages of manuscript in her hands. It's dusk. 
ANNIE I'm sorry, Paul. This is all wrong, you'll have to do it over again. 
PAUL (totally stunned) What? What happened to "I'll treasure whatever you do?" 
ANNIE Paul, it's not worthy of you. Throw it all out except for the part of naming that gravedigger after me. You can leave that in. 
PAUL I really value your criticism, but maybe you're being a little hasty here. 
ANNIE Paul, what you've written just isn't fair. 
PAUL --not fair? 
ANNIE That's right--when I was growing up in Bakersfield, my favorite thing in all the world was to go to the movies on Saturday afternoons for the chapter plays... 
PAUL (it just comes out) --cliff-hangers-- 
ANNIE (suddenly angry) I know that, Mister Man--they also call them serials. I'm not stupid, you know. (and she's a child again) Anyway, my favorite was Rocket Man, and once it was a no-brakes chapter, the bad guys stuck him in a car on a mountain road and knocked him out and welded the doors shut and tore out the brakes and started him to his death and he woke up and tried to steer and tried to get out, but the car went off a cliff before he could escape and it crashed and burned and--I was so upset and excited and the next week you better believe I was first in line and they always start with the end of the last week and there was Rocket Man trying to get out, and here came the cliff and JUST BEFORE the car went off he jumped free and all the kids cheered-- (standing up now) --but I didn't cheer, I stood right up and started shouting, "This isn't what happened last week--have you all got amnesia?--THEY JUST CHEATED US--THIS WASN'T FAIR--" 
ANNIE: CLOSE UP. Still in her childhood reverie. Shouting: 
ANNIE "HE DIDN'T GET OUT OF THE COCKADOODIE CAR!" 
PAUL They always cheated like that in cliff-- (stops himself) --chapter plays. 
ANNIE But not you. Not with my Misery. Remember, Ian did ride for Dr. Cleary at the end of the last book, but his horse fell jumping that fence and Ian broke his shoulder and his ribs and lay there all night in the ditch so he never reached the doctor, so there couldn't have been any "experimental blood transfusion" that saved her life. Misery was buried in the ground at the end, Paul, so you'll have to start there. 
As she goes-- 
PAUL Look at this, I've got Lizzie Borden for an editor, here. 
PAUL slumps, staring barefully at the typewriter. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
OUTSIDE THE FARMHOUSE. NIGHT. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
OUTSIDE THE FARMHOUSE. NEXT MORNING. 
CUT TO: 
PAUL'S ROOM. DAY. 
PAUL is at the table. He takes the Novril off his breakfast tray, wheels over to the bed, and stuffs them into the mattress. He hears FOOTSTEPS coming down the hall. He smoothly wheels back to the table. A pause. 
ANNIE enters to remove the tray. 
ANNIE What's the matter, Paul? You haven't written a word. 
PAUL I can't write this anymore. 
ANNIE Don't be silly. Of course you can. 
PAUL I'm telling you, I can't. 
ANNIE You can--you have the "gotta"-- 
PAUL The what? 
ANNIE The "gotta." Remember, you talked about it in Playboy magazine. You said there's a million things you can't do in this world; you can't hit a curve ball, you can't fix a leaky faucet or make a marriage work-- but there's one thing you always have, and that's the power of the "gotta." 
PAUL I said that? 
ANNIE You said you can make it so they gotta turn the page. You know, "I 'gotta' know will she live," "I 'gotta' know will he catch the killer." "I gotta see how this chapter ends." You said it. I don't usually buy that magazine. I only got it, 'cause they were interviewing you. 
CUT TO: 
PAUL: CLOSE UP. Blinking. 
PAUL (quietly) What about a bee...? 
ANNIE What? 
PAUL Nothing. 
CUT TO: 
BUSTER Hey, Jim, what's doing? Uh-huh... uh- huh... Jim, we've been over this. If you're gonna have benches in front of your store, people are gonna sit on them. I don't like him either, but I'm not going to come over there and tell him to move. Give my best to Denise. Bye. 
VIRGINIA (looking through the books; all paperback Misery novels) Well, whoever she is, she sure likes to read a lot. 
BUSTER Virginia, I'm flattered you think I got that much energy. I just figured if I can't find Paul Sheldon, at least I can find out what he wrote about. 
VIRGINIA What do you expect to find? A story about a guy who drove his car off a cliff in a snowstorm? 
BUSTER Now, you see, it's that kind of sarcasm that's given our marriage real spice. 
CUT TO: 
STUDY. NIGHT. 
PAUL is sitting at a table that Annie has set up with her best china and silverware. It is as romantic as Annie Wilkes gets. ANNIE enters, carrying a basket of rolls. She sits and serves Paul. 
ANNIE I hope you like it. 
PAUL It looks wonderful. And so do you. 
ANNIE Oh... 
They eat in awkward silence. Finally: 
PAUL I've never had meatloaf this good, what do you do to it? 
ANNIE My secret is I only use fresh tomatoes, never canned. And to give it that little extra zip, I mix in some Spam with the ground beef. 
PAUL Oh. (pause) You can't get this in a restaurant in New York. 
After another pause: 
PAUL Annie, I think we should have a toast. 
ANNIE A toast? 
PAUL Yes, to Misery. Let me pour you some more wine. 
Paul pours more of the Gallo wine, then raises his glass. 
ANNIE To Misery. 
PAUL Wait, let's do this right. Do you have any candles? 
ANNIE Oh, I don't know. I think so. I'll go look. 
She exits into the kitchen. PAUL quickly pulls the packet filled with Novril powder from his pants. He empties it into her glass of wine, stuffs the empty packet back into his pants, talking the whole time: 
PAUL Did you study decorating, or do you just have a flair? 
ANNIE Oh, you. I just picked things up over the years. 
PAUL Well, it certainly says you. 
ANNIE You really think so? 
PAUL Absolutely. Listen, if you can't find any, it's okay. I just thought it might be nice. 
ANNIE re-enters with a candle. 
ANNIE Are you kidding? If anyone ever told me that one day I'd be having a candlelit dinner with Paul Sheldon in my own house, I woulda checked both legs to see which one was being pulled. Will this do? 
PAUL It's perfect. 
She places the candle on the table. With a slight tremor in her hand, she lights the candle. PAUL raises his glass. 
PAUL To Misery and Annie Wilkes, who brought her back to life. 
ANNIE raises her glass. 
ANNIE Oh, Paul, every time I think about it, I get goosebumps. 
They clink glasses. 
And with that, her emotions having gotten the best of her, she knocks over the candle. In trying to right the situation, she places her glass back down, and as she reaches for the candle, she knocks over her glass, spilling the wine. 
ANNIE (wiping up the spilled wine with her napkin) Oh, God, what have I done? I'm so sorry, Paul. I ruined your beautiful toast. Will you ever forgive me? Here, let me pour another one. (she does) Can we pretend this never happened? To Misery? 
PAUL To Misery. 
So they drink their wine. 
CUT TO: 
OUTSIDE THE FARMHOUSE. DAY. 
The snow, although still present, has melted somewhat. And starting now and continuing throughout is this: the sound of typing. 
CUT TO: 
CUT TO: 
PAUL'S ROOM. NIGHT. 
Paul, staring and 
CUT TO: 
THE PILE, growing, growing and 
CUT TO: 
PAUL'S FINGERS 
CUT TO: 
PAUL'S ROOM 
PAUL, ripping open a new ream of paper... 
CUT TO: 
PAUL'S ROOM. DUSK. 
His lips move silently. He's not even aware of it as he nods and... 
CUT TO: 
THE PAPER IN THE TYPEWRITER, line after line being written. 
INTERCUT WITH: 
Paul's face at DAY, NIGHT, and DUSK in rapid succession, ending with 
CUT TO: 
ANNIE'S FARMHOUSE. NIGHT. 
Lightning! Giant deep rolls of THUNDER as RAIN begins... 
CUT TO: 
TYPEWRITER being lifted out of frame, then back in, then out again. 
CUT TO: 
PAUL'S ROOM. NIGHT. 
The pile of manuscript has doubled. Maybe two hundred pages. 
PAUL, with some effort, is pumping the typewriter up and down. Finally, he places it back down and puts his arm back in the sling. 
CUT TO: 
PAUL, looking outside breifly. 
CUT TO: 
THE RAIN. Worse. The SOUND hit s the roof of the house, hits the window. 
CUT TO: 
ANNIE, lumbering in--she's never looked like this: She's wearing her slippers and her pink quilted housecoat. Her eyes are without life. Her hair, loose and straggly, hangs around her face. Slowly, like a  robot, she goes to PAUL, who looks silently up at her. 
ANNIE Here's your pills. 
She drops them on the table. 
CUT TO: 
PAUL, as the pills hit his chest and bounce into his lap. 
PAUL Annie, what is it? 
CUT TO: 
ANNIE 
ANNIE (half turns away, turns back, gestures outside) The rain... sometimes it gives me the blues. 
CUT TO: 
ANNIE: CLOSE UP. And suddenly it's as if she's been turned off, gone lifeless. 
CUT TO: 
PAUL, staring at her. No sound but the rain. 
CUT TO: 
PETE (mimes typing) No, the typing kind. 
CUT TO: 
BUSTER: CLOSE UP 
BUSTER Oh. That kind. Nothing odd about that. 
He cannot hide his excitement now as we-- 
CUT TO: 
ANNIE, entering Paul's room. He lies back in the wheelchair, eyes closed. Liberace music playing in the background. From the start, PAUL'S TONE is different--strong, he's in control. 
ANNIE Paul, don't you think it's time for you to start writing again? It's been over a week. 
PAUL I don't know, it's weird, but a couple of broken bones hasn't done a lot for my creative juices. Get the fuck out of here. 
ANNIE Don't talk to me like that. 
PAUL (staring at her now) Why, what are you going to do? (spreading his arms wide) Kill me? Take your best shot. 
ANNIE (taken aback) Why are you so mean, Mister you'd-be- dead-in-the-snow-if-it-wasn't-for- me? 
PAUL Oh, no reason, you keep me prisoner, you make me burn my book, you drive a sledgehammer into my ankles... 
ANNIE I'll drive a sledgehammer into your man-gland if you're not nicer-- 
PAUL (He spreads his legs) Be my guest. 
ANNIE (after a beat) That's disgusting. 
As she exits. 
CUT TO: 
A ROAD. Empty. Hold for a moment--now a car appears around a curve. 
CUT TO: 
THE CAR. BUSTER is driving fast. 
CUT TO: 
PAUL in his room. He sits as before, by the window. He doesn't move. Now he closes his eyes, stretches, sighs as we 
CUT TO: 
THE KITCHEN 
ANNIE, busily making cocoa. 
CUT TO: 
BUSTER IN HIS CAR. He stops at a mailbox. The name on the box is WILKES. Buster turns his car slowly into the driveway by the mailbox. 
CUT TO: 
PAUL. He yawns, opens his eyes briefly. Closes them. In the distance now, growing more and more visible is Buster's car-- 
--and now PAUL'S EYES go open wide, and he's staring out the window at the car as it keeps on coming, closer, closer and 
CUT TO: 
BUSTER, looking around. He's driving very slowly, carefully. 
CUT TO: 
PAUL. Fixating on the window and now it's all going to be all right, everything's going to be all right-- 
--and then ANNIE is on him, hypodermic needle in hand, jabbing it into his arm. He desperately tries to fight her off, but the drug starts to take hold. He tries to grab her by the neck, but she fights him off as she wheels him out of the room, down the hall and towards the cellar door. 
ANNIE I don't think I'll ever understand you. I cook your meals, I tend to you practically twenty-four hours a day, and you continue to fight me. When are we going to develop a sense of trust? 
ANNIE opens the cellar door. PAUL is all but limp by now. As she picks him up and starts to carry him down the steps-- 
CUT TO: 
BUSTER pulling up in front of the house. As he gets out of his car-- 
CUT TO: 
ANNIE placing Paul on the cellar floor and heading up the stairs. PAUL is out. 
CUT TO: 
BUSTER heading up the steps to the front door. 
CUT TO: 
As she exits into the kitchen. 
ANNIE There's some already made. 
BUSTER lingers in Paul's room for a beat, then goes into the hallway. 
BUSTER Must get lonely, living out here all by yourself. 
ANNIE I always say if you can't enjoy your own company, you're not fit company for anyone else. 
BUSTER You got a point there... 
As Buster moves up the stairs-- 
CUT TO: 
PAUL, still fighting the drug. His arm twitches almost involuntarily, grazing the barbecue. 
CUT TO: 
BUSTER opening the door to Annie's room. He looks around and just as he is about to turn to leave-- 
CUT TO: 
ANNIE, standing right in front of him. 
ANNIE Here you are. 
BUSTER heads down the stairs, ANNIE follows. 
BUSTER Thanks, Miz Wilkes, but I don't want to take up any more of your time. I best be going. 
ANNIE But you didn't even taste your cocoa. 
They cross to the front door. 
BUSTER I'm sure it's wonderful, but really should be getting back. 
BUSTER opens the door. 
CUT TO: 
PAUL stirring. 
CUT TO: 
BUSTER and ANNIE at the door. 
BUSTER If you don't mind, perhaps I could pay you another visit sometime. 
ANNIE I'd be delighted. Now that you know the way... 
With that, she closes the door. We stay with BUSTER. He stands on the front porch for a beat, thinking, then starts heading down the porch steps. Just as he reaches about halfway down, we HEAR A LOUD CRASH coming from inside the house. 
CUT TO: 
PAUL--he has managed to partially fight his way through the drug, and in waking has accidentally knocked over the barbecue. He fights to clear the cobwebs. 
CUT TO: 
BUSTER Miz Wilkes, are you all right? 
There is no answer. He quietly moves into the house. 
BUSTER Miz Wilkes? 
Again, no answer. 
CUT TO: 
PAUL, still fighting to gain complete consciousness. 
PAUL (weakly) Here. I'm down here. Down here. 
CUT TO: 
BUSTER. Hearing Paul's muffled call for help, he tracks the sound to the cellar door. As PAUL continues to call out, Buster looks around, sees no one, and opens the cellar door. The shaft of light from the open door pours down on Paul, who is still lying on the floor. 
BUSTER Mr. Sheldon? 
But before Paul can answer, there's the sound of a LOUD EXPLOSION. Seemingly from nowhere a hole is ripped through Buster's chest, knocking him out of frame, revealing Annie, smoking shotgun in hand, standing at the top of the cellar steps. 
ANNIE Don't feel bad, Paul. It had to happen. I've been waiting for this sign. 
ANNIE walks toward BUSTER'S BODY and very casually takes his gun out of its holster. 
ANNIE I've known for some time why I was chosen to save you. You and I were meant to be together forever. But now our time in this world must end. But don't worry, Paul. I've already prepared for what must be done. I put two bullets in my gun, one for you and one for me. Oh, darling, it will be so beautiful. 
With that, ANNIE turns and exits the cellar. 
PAUL You'll know very soon. I'm starting the last chapter. And when I finish, I want everything to be perfect. I'll require three things. 
ANNIE What things? 
PAUL You don't know? 
ANNIE (smiling) I was fooling, silly. (ticking them off) You need a cigarette, because you used to smoke but you quit except when you finish a book, and you just have one, and the match is to light it. And you need one glass of champagne. (thinks) Dome Pear-igg-non. 
PAUL Dome Pear-igg-non it is. 
AS ANNIE exits. 
CUT TO: 
THE WINDOW 
The first light of morning is starting to break through. 
CUT TO: 
PAUL, stretching. He makes sure everything is set. 
PAUL (calling out) Annie! Annie! 
With that, she enters. 
ANNIE Yes, Paul. 
PAUL I'm almost done. 
ANNIE Oh, Paul, this is so romantic. Ian and Windthorne dueling for the right to Misery's hand. Does Ian win? Oh, don't me. It's Windthorne, right? 
PAUL You'll know everything in a minute. Get the champagne. 
ANNIE (dying from the suspense) Ahh!!! 
She exits; PAUL adjusts the manuscript on the table and then types the last line. 
CUT TO: 
ANNIE IN THE KITCHEN. She takes the bottle of Dom Perignon out of the icebox, places it on a tray with two glasses-- opens a drawer--takes out the gun--places it in her pocket-- then takes out the hypodermic needle and places it on the tray. 
CUT TO: 
PAUL'S ROOM 
ANNIE enters with the tray. She sets it down on the table. 
ANNIE Did I do good? 
PAUL You did perfect. Except for one thing. This time we need two glasses. 
He takes the last page out of the typewriter. 
ANNIE Oh, Paul. 
As soon as she exits, PAUL drops the manuscript to the floor, pulls the lighter fluid from his pants, and starts dousing the manuscript with lighter fluid. He grabs the last chapter and twists the last few pages together torch style. He douses it with the fluid and holds the match out of sight. 
He smiles as we 
CUT TO: 
ANNIE entering with the second glass... 
PAUL It's all right here, Annie. Remember how for all those years no one ever knew who Misery's real father was, or if they'd ever be reunited? It's all right here. Will Misery finally lead her countrymen to freedom? Does she finally marry Ian or will it be Windthorne? It's all right here. 
CUT TO: 
THE MATCH, as he strikes it and 
CUT TO: 
ANNIE screaming-- 
ANNIE Paul, you can't. 
And as her hands fly out beseechingly-- 
CUT TO: 
THE CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE--it falls to the floor, explodes like a torpedo, shards of glass all over, curds of foam everywhere-- 
PAUL Why not? I learned it from you... 
And on that-- 
CUT TO: 
THE LAST CHAPTER as Paul brings the match close to it and it bursts into flame. And Paul, holding it like the torch it is. Annie starts moving forward now. 
ANNIE, the stronger, relentless, moving up on him, and 
CUT TO: 
PAUL, his grip broken as he turns and 
CUT TO: 
ANNIE, all-powerful, looming over him and 
CUT TO: 
PAUL, hitting up at her and 
CUT TO: 
ANNIE, swelling, and the blood pours down and if she feels his blows she doesn't show it and 
CUT TO: 
PAUL, whatever energy he has left he uses now, trying to twist and strike and as his body moves-- 
CUT TO: 
METAL BASED FLOOR LAMP and 
CUT TO: 
PAUL, grabbing the thing, suddenly bringing it across his body, clobbering Annie in the face and 
CUT TO: 
ANNIE, startled by the power of the blow and for a moment she is stopped and 
CUT TO: 
PAUL, as with everything he has left, he crunches her forehead with the sharp heavy metal base, just creams her as the air is forced out of her-- 
CUT TO: 
ANNIE. Her eyes roll up into her head. For a moment all we see are the whites-- 
--then she collapses on PAUL, a motionless mountain of slack flesh. 
CUT TO: 
PAUL, scrambling free, pushing her off him, crawling for the door-- 
CUT TO: 
--outside the door, as PAUL crawls into view, makes it to the corridor, reaches back, closes the door, locks it. 
Safe, he collapses, exhausted against the wall opposite the door. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
PAUL. HOURS LATER. It is dawn. He is awakened by a loud smashing at the front door. After a couple of heart-stopping pounds, 
CUT TO: 
THE FRONT DOOR smashes open, revealing two cops with guns drawn. 
THE POLICEMEN, hurrying to PAUL. The YOUNGER COP kneels beside Paul. 
YOUNGER COP It's the writer--the dead one-- 
PAUL (trying to keep himself together) --right! I'm the dead one-- 
OLDER COP Where's Sheriff McCain? 
PAUL He's in the cellar. She killed him. 
OLDER COP Annie Wilkes? 
PAUL Yeah. She's in there. 
CUT TO: 
The OLDER COP, taking the key to the room, unlocks the door, throws it open, and as he steps inside-- 
CUT TO: 
INSIDE THE BEDROOM 
The OLDER COP has his gun ready to fire, but even with it tight in his hand, he's edgy as hell. 
He looks around-- 
--glass and bloodstains on the floor. The charred remains of a manuscript.

SEVENTH DRAFT January 12, 1992 
INT. REGIS & KATHIE LEE SHOW SET 
A horribly deformed figure--hunchback, misshapen head--sits on a stool in complete silhouette. This is RICK COOGAN. 
RICK Can you imagine it, Regis, Kathie Lee? One day I'm a hot young movie star, and the next day I'm a hideous mutant freak, covered with festering lesions. 
Oddly, REGIS and KATHIE LEE are also in complete silhouette. 
REGIS Sounds like my wife when she misses a mudpack! 
The audience CRACKS UP. Kathie Lee pooh-poohs Regis. 
KATHIE LEE Oh Regis! You're incorrigible! Ha- ha! (to Rick, she turns EARNEST) Ricky, once you were the all- American boy next door, star of the beloved Hey Dude films. Now the very mention of your name makes children scream in terror. We've all read about your disturbing story. But the people want to hear it from you, Ricky Coogan. (SFX: children scream) Won't you tell us your story? 
RICK Well, it's kinda long, but okay. It all started when I signed a deal to be spokesman for the E.E.S. conglomerate... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. E.E.S. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 
The E.E.S. logo--a large metal shoe with a bar across it, with the words "Everything Except Shoes" beneath. Widen to reveal RICHARD HERTZ, president of E.E.S., smiling rigidly to camera. RICK COOGAN is next to him, also holding a stiff movie-star smile. FLASH! They shake hands as the EES photographer takes publicity shots. Off to one side, behind Hertz, are several EES EXECUTIVES. Behind Rick is his entourage: LAWYER, BODYGUARD, TRAINER, STYLIST, and SPIRIT GUIDE. 
Further off, at the boardroom table, four DODDERING OLD CORPORATE FARTS on the brink of death look on with glazed expressions. 
RICK (through a clenched smile) So, what kind of crap do you scumbags want me to peddle? 
HERTZ Everything. Everything except shoes, of course. Hah hah... 
He laughs pathetically. Rick doesn't respond. Hertz nods to a nearby EXECUTIVE who hands him some BEEF STICKS. 
HERTZ Meaty Twig Beef Sticks. 
Rick takes them and holds them up to the camera. Smiles. Flash. 
HERTZ Helmet Head hair spray. 
He takes the hair spray and holds it up. Smile. Flash. 
The assistant carefully hands Hertz a pulsating metal container with lots of warnings and danger symbols on it. Hertz gives it to Rick. 
HERTZ Noxon 24 biogenetic neuro- fertilizer. 
Rick holds it up, then pushes it away in disgust. 
RICK Fertilizer? Ricky Coogan does not do ads for hi-tech cow shit. I'm a star, got it, Hertz? (to his aide) Rico, give these misguided clowns Tony Danza's phone number, and let's get the hell out of here. 
He gives the finger to the EES photographer, who obligingly takes a picture. Hertz waves at him to get lost, and calls after Rick who's headed to the door with his entourage. 
HERTZ Rick. Wait! Only you can stand up to the radicals trying to keep Noxon from the struggling farmers whose very future depends on it. 
RICK (HESITATES) Noxon? Wasn't that just banned? 
HERTZ Only in the U.S....and Europe. 
RICK But I heard that shit's lethal. 
Hertz lets out a big laugh. He shakes his head at Rick. 
HERTZ Rick, Rick, Rick... You want proof? Fine. Just take a seat. Please. 
Rick nods to his entourage. They sit at the boardroom table, across from the EES execs. An easel behind Hertz shows a placard with a bar graph. Hertz whispers something to an aide, who scurries off. 
HERTZ (TO RICK) Meet the head of our South American research facility, Juan Valdez. 
The aide ushers in a handsome LATIN AMERICAN EXECUTIVE in a natty three-piece suit and a sombrero. 
RICK Yeah, why? 
X-RAY CHECKER Is this your kid? 
He indicates the X-ray monitor, where we see the skeleton outline of a BUCKTOOTHED, BESPECTACLED 10 YEAR OLD KID curled up in Rick's bag. The kid waves. Rick and Ernie look at each other in horror. 
RICK/ERNIE Stuey Gluck! 
The bag bursts open, and out pops STUEY GLUCK, an obsessive young autograph hound toting a stack of scrapbooks and memorabilia. 
STUEY Rick! Rick! Look! I got a rare still from your high school production of The Glass Menagerie! Could you sign it for me? Please?! 
RICK NO! (TO ERNIE) Let's get the hell out of here! 
Ernie nods and yanks the bag away from under Stuey. They run away down the corridor. Stuey chases them, holding up an 8 by 10 photo. 
STUEY Rick! Wait up! 
FURTHER DOWN THE CORRIDOR 
Rick and Ernie run around a corner with Stuey in pursuit. 
STUEY Rick! Remember the speech you gave at the Actors Forum for Social Justice!? 
He holds up a cassette player and hits play. It's Rick's old speech. 
RICK'S VOICE (FROM TAPE) If all the world is a stage, then let us shine the spotlight on truth, integrity, and a deep compassion for all life. 
RICK Leave me alone, troll! (TO ERNIE) That was before I got an entertainment lawyer. 
ERNIE Quick, down here. 
Ernie leads Rick down an adjacent hallway. 
IN THE HALLWAY 
It's a dead end. Rick and Ernie are trapped. Ernie gives Rick a sheepish look. Stuey stands at the entrance of the hallway. He holds up a Time magazine. 
STUEY Rick! Rick! It says here Noxon's dangerous. Why are you lending your name to it? What's happened to you, Rick? You used to be good! And now... I just don't know... 
Stuey starts to cry. Rick looks guilty. 
RICK Don't cry, Stuey, I'm still good. 
BAM! A passing electric baggage cart nails Stuey at full speed and carries him off down the corridor, screaming bloody murder. 
RICK ALRIGHT! 
Rick and Ernie high five. 
CUT TO: 
INT. FIRST CLASS CABIN - DAY 
A SEXY STEWARDESS pours champagne for Rick and Ernie. The anarchist sits nearby with the bomb on his lap. Rick winks suggestively at the stewardess. She walks off, obviously not interested. Rick raises his glass to Ernie, oozing sleazy confidence. 
RICK In the bag. 
The plane hits turbulence, and Rick's drink flies up out of his glass--he catches it as it comes down. Another STEWARDESS helps the Anarchist put his bomb in the overhead compartment. Ernie ogles her. She sneers at him. We hear the CAPTAIN'S voice on the loudspeaker. 
CAPTAIN (V.0.) Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. To the right of the aircraft, you can see a great view of the Grand Canyon. 
All the passengers crane their necks to the right. 
CAPTAIN (V.0.) And to the left you can see a panic- stricken little troll. 
Rick turns to his window and flings open the shade to reveal... 
STUEY 
on the wing, pressing his face up against the glass. He's holding up a publicity shot of Rick and screaming something we can't hear. 
RICK AHHHHHHH! 
The man mutters something weakly. Ernie puts his ear up close to hear him better. 
ERNIE He says the pants don't usually come off for less than two-fifty, but since you're so cute, he'll make an exception. 
FLIP TO: 
RICK 
buried beneath rolls and rolls of bandages, making his way through the protesters on crutches. Ernie helps him along, nervously. As Rick spots Julie from behind, he hands the crutches over to Ernie. 
RICK Here. 
Ernie takes the crutches. Rick waves his arms dramatically, clutches his bandaged legs, and winces in pain. 
RICK Help! Ow! Give me back my crutches! You monster! Oh, the pain! The agony! 
He falls theatrically at Julie's feet. 
JULIE Are you okay? Let me help you! 
RICK Thanks. Don't worry about me. What's one man's pain weighed against the global injustice of corporate tyrants like EES? Go. The fight must continue. 
Julie's buying it big time. She gazes deep into Rick's eyes. 
JULIE Wow... My name's Julie. 
RICK Josh. Josh Tavner. 
Ernie sticks a hand out, grinning sarcastically. 
ERNIE Mother Theresa. Glad to meet you. 
Julie turns on Ernie viciously. She slaps him hard, and grabs the crutches from him. 
ERNIE Ow! Hey! 
JULIE Give me those, ape. Help him up. 
Rick rises to his feet "painfully." 
JULIE Hey Josh, a busload of us are headed over to Maracas to protest Noxon 24 and pelt Ricky Coogan with cow shit. 
RICK Same here! You could ride with us. 
JULIE Us? You're with him? 
She looks at Ernie, who grins stupidly. 
RICK Oh, he's okay. Have you ever heard of an idiot savant? 
JULIE Sure. 
RICK That's Ernie. Except for the savant part. 
Ernie glares at Rick. Rick smiles at Julie hopefully. Julie looks at them both, and can't help smiling herself. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CAR - DAY 
Ernie drives the battered old convertible which bears the proud logo of Santa Flan Rent-a-Car. There's a Pepsi billboard in the background. Julie massages Rick in the back seat. 
RICK (faking terrible pain) Ooooh, my pelvis. 
JULIE (SYMPATHETIC) Is this better? 
ERNIE'S POV IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR 
Rick moans and cracks a huge grin through his bandages. Ernie tries to get in on the conversation. 
ERNIE Hey Julie. You know I'm kind of an idea man myself. Like, let's say there's a nuclear war, and the only two people left are you and the Pope... Would you pork him? 
Disgusted, Julie smacks Ernie sharply and continues massaging Rick. Scowling with jealousy, Ernie tries a new approach. 
The car stops at the end of the long, spooky driveway, just past a sizzling electric fence. Rick, Julie, and Ernie get out and look around. It's eerily quiet. 
There is a large dilapidated mining shed complete with rusted ducts and a tall smoke stack, a tattered carnival tent with an ornate stage flat facade, a lopsided outhouse, a creepy broken-down farm house, and in the center of it all, a giant molded carnival head with big staring eyes, which slowly rotates on a creaky base. 
Ernie looks hard at the big eyes. He turns away for a second, then spins around again. The EYES are looking in a different direction. Ernie shakes his head and unwraps a chocolate bar. 
JULIE Isn't it great? It's so "real"... 
RICK Real stupid. (TO ERNIE) Let's go. This place is dead. 
ERNIE Yeah. Where are all the weirdos? 
VOICE (O.S.) There are no weirdos here. 
Startled, they turn to see ELIJAH C. SKUGGS, a twisted, haggard old man. He takes a bite out of an ice cream cone which contains the rear half of a chipmunk with a maraschino cherry on top. Elijah has bad teeth, a bad shave, and scary eyes. We now realize the giant head is molded in his image. 
ELIJAH Mutants, yes. Genetic nightmares, definitely. Children of Hell and twisted masses of living, breathing tormented flesh, certainly. But as for weirdos... not a one. Unless of course you count me! Ha ha ha! 
RICK Nah, you seem like a regular dumbshit old redneck to me. 
Elijah ignores him. Julie shoots him a look and smiles at Elijah. 
JULIE I'm Julie. And you are... 
ELIJAH Elijah C. Skuggs, proud proprietor of Skugg's Fabulous Freak Land and Mutant Emporium. But you knew that. After all, you've ventured miles away from civilization, hospitals, telephones, (TO RICK) police... How may I help-you? 
RICK Drop dead. 
Elijah smiles, unfazed. Julie glares at Rick. She smiles apologetically at Elijah. 
JULIE We'd like to see your freak show. You see, only by appreciating the variety and innovation of nature can we come to respect the fragile complexity of our global eco- system. 
Elijah nudges Ernie. 
ELIJAH And you come to me looking for weirdos? 
Ernie shrugs. He goes to take a bite out of his chocolate bar and finds only the empty wrapper left in his hand. 
ERNIE Hey! What the-- 
He looks behind him, and there--about ten feet away--is... 
A HULKING BALD MAN 
warts all over, squatting on the ground and chewing happily. This is TOAD. 
Julie and Rick turn and see him. 
JULIE (REPULSED) Eeuuuwww... (composes herself and WAVES) Ahem. Hello. 
Toad doesn't respond to her waves. 
ELIJAH Mr. Toad is my... assistant. As for the show, I'm afraid the next parade of deformity isn't until tomorrow night... 
Rick and Ernie pretend to be disappointed. They turn to leave. Julie's sincerely upset. 
JULIE Oh, just our luck... 
Elijah grabs Rick's shoulder and turns him around. 
ELIJAH However! I do have a private exhibit in my shed you might enjoy. I don't usually share it with the general public... 
RICK We're deeply honored. But no thanks. 
ERNIE Yeah. We really must be-- 
He raises his cigarette to his lips, but it's gone! He turns to see Toad, ten feet behind him, puffing away happily. Hmmm. Elijah is already leading Julie towards the shed. 
JULIE The sideshow tradition has been misrepresented by the media. You don't traffic in human misery. You show society the part of itself it doesn't want to look at. 
ELIJAH Yes... Yesm I see... 
He looks over to Rick and Ernie with a grin that says "Where'd you find this nutty chick?" 
ELIJAH Let 'er rip, Toad! 
Toad yanks a pull-start cord and the machine rumbles to life. Elijah pulls the Tasty Freekz lever and fills a small dish with phosphorescent ointment. Toad cuts open their clothes, exposing their sides, and pushes them close together. 
ERNIE Wait a second. You're really gonna smear that stuff on us and mutate our body parts!? 
ELIJAH Correct. 
ERNIE Well... then could you give me a really big rodney? 
ELIJAH I'm a mad scientist pal, not a miracle worker. 
Elijah smears the ointment on their exposed sides. Their skin begins to bubble and undulate. 
JULIE/ERNIE Oh God!... No!... Holy shit! (ETC) 
A grapefruit-sized lump pops up on Ernie's side, then another on Julie's side, and then the lumps do a little synchronized dance together. Suddenly Ernie's flesh balloons out and melds into Julie's side. The mass of connected skin continues to bubble and mutate. Odd shapes press up under THE SKIN: 
Four humans faces that quickly become Mount Rushmore... 
The Pepsi logo--"Pepsi: The Choice of a New Generation"... Julie and Ernie merge into one amorphous flesh blob which then takes the form of... 
Demon versions of GUMBY and his magic horse POKEY. Gumby's got his back to camera. He's grabbing his crotch and flipping everyone off. 
ELIJAH Gumby! Put that thing away! 
Gumby and Pokey mutate back into a blob and then into... 
JULIE/ERNIE 
joined side to side, their two heads on a single body which is split down the middle--half Julie, half Ernie. Elijah wheels a large mirror in front of them. 
ELIJAH Feast your eyes! 
JULIE NOOOOO! 
ERNIE Well, at least I'll never have to go far for a piece of tail. 
JULIE Pig! 
She SMACKS him. 
ERNIE Ouch! I was just trying to keep things light. Oh God! Why me!? 
He starts blubbering uncontrollably. Toad drags them towards the door. 
JULIE Mother always said there'd be days like this. And I thought she was nuts! 
They exit. Elijah turns to Rick. 
ELIJAH (gestures to Julie/Ernie) A mere party trick. But you, you're gonna be special. 
Elijah steps over to the computer console and starts punching keys. 
RICK (GETS TOUGH) Let me go, Skuggs, or else! (MORE) 
I got some RICK(cont'd) friends that'll come down here and mess you up bad, homey! (Elijah chuckles. Rick tries a different APPROACH) I got some other friends who can score you box seats at the Superbowl, no problem. (ANOTHER FAILURE) YOU EVER HAD YOUR BALLS CUT OFF, YOU FUCKIN' APE?! (switches gears again) You ever had a hot fudge bath with Morgana? [foreign take: Madonna] 
ELIJAH (LOOKS UP--INTERESTED) You know her? 
Rick nods hopefully. Elijah considers it for a moment, then frowns. 
ELIJAH Ah, screw it. I'd never get anywhere with her. TOAD! FIRE UP THAT INFERNAL YOGURT MACHINE! 
Toad starts the machine. Elijah pulls the lever and dispenses a bowl full of glowing ointment. He carries it towards Rick, leering maniacally. 
ELIJAH For years I've strived to create the ultimate monster. The first of a whole new generation of superfreaks! Now I've finally got you, the perfect subject--a real asshole! HA-HA- (he pauses and looks closer at Rick) Wait a minute. Aren't you the guy from "Hey Dude Three-The Beguiling?" 
RICK Yeah, that's me! 
ELIJAH You were great in that picture! Oh well, I guess for the next one they'll have to get Christian Slater! HA-HA-HA! 
Elijah squishes the ointment into Rick's horrified face. 
BOB VILA walks up next to Elijah. 
BOB You know you could expose those rustic beams and put in a skylight over one weekend, Elijah. 
ELIJAH Give it a rest, Bob! 
He pushes Bob away into the freak house, gives Rick a goodbye wink and walks out the door. 
EXT. OUTHOUSE 
Elijah pauses and looks at the tiny outhouse. 
ELIJAH One of these days I gotta put a shitter in there. 
Bob Vila steps out of nowhere again, holding a Time-Life book. 
BOB No problem. It's all here in my Beds and Bathrooms book, Elijah. And you pay nothing for thirt-- 
BONK! Elijah knocks him out cold with a ball-peen hammer from his tool belt. 
INT. FREAK HOUSE 
It takes a few moments for Rick's eyes to adjust to the dim light. There's nobody in sight. The walls are lined with dark cubicles, stacked atop each other with walkways like prison cells. Rick staggers to his feet, and makes his way forward. 
RICK Ernie? Julie? 
ERNIE Over here, Coog. 
JULIE Are you alright? 
Rick sees the vague outline of JulieErnie a few yards away. 
RICK I know that voice. That's the voice that said, (MIMICS) "Cool, a freak show. Let's check it out!" 
JULIE What!? Oh sure, blame the woman. Typical. 
RICK (MIMICS) "It's so real." Is this real enough for you? I'm friggin' Quasimodo! 
ERNIE Chill out, Coog. You're talking to the original tag team of ugly pukes. Step into the light. 
RICK Okay, here I come. 
Rick steps forward into a pool of light. Julie and Ernie are caught by surprise. Julie struggles to keep her composure. Ernie's repulsed. 
ERNIE ULP! 
Ernie turns away and pukes on the floor. Julie soldiers on. 
JULIE Oh geez... It's not so (GULP) revolting. After all, physical beauty is just a socially-enforced myth that we, uh, oh shit... ULPI 
Julie turns away and pukes on the floor. 
RICK (OFFENDED) Yeah, well, you're no Mona Lisas yourself. You're lucky I've got a strong stomach! 
VOICE (O.C.) And you're lucky I don't BITE you! Heh heh heh heh ... 
Rick wheels around to see JUAN THE DOG BOY, snickering behind him. Juan is a hairy young Mexican with a snout, dog ears, and canine teeth--Scrappy Doo with an attitude. 
Rick assumes a threatening pose. 
RICK Get away from me you, you... 
JUAN Freak? Ha ha hahahaha! (he stares hard at Rick) I am Juan the Dog Boy, leader of the freaks. 
JULIE (walks up to them) Kind of the "top dog." 
Juan scratches himself behind the ear with his hind leg. 
JUAN Welcome to Hell, Rick. Shake? 
He extends a hand to Rick. Rick doesn't take it. He hears a slight RUSTLING noise from the direction of the cubicles, and turns to look around the apparently empty Freak House. 
RICK No thanks. I don't plan on staying long. How many of you are there in here anyway? 
Rick peeks around and sees Julie scratching Juan's belly. He licks her face happily, and she giggles with delight. Ernie is reading "The Woman's Room," trying not to notice all of this. 
Rick watches, disgusted. He tears up the pamphlet, throws it to the ground, and storms off to find his own cubicle. 
Ernie peeks at Julie and Juan continuing their foreplay. Juan stops abruptly. 
JUAN Hey. Mind your business. 
ERNIE Sorry. 
Ernie returns to his book. The camera PANS up to Rick's cubicle. He's sitting on his cot, distractedly whittling a log with his knife-like talon. He talks to himself, making sure to be loud enough for JulieErnie and Juan to hear. 
RICK Well that EES guy should rescue me any minute. Then it's straight to the plastic surgeon and back to sunny old L.A. I wonder how many of my beautiful, anatomically correct girlfriends will be waiting for me. 
STUEY GLUCK (V.O.) I'll be waiting for you, Rick! 
RICK Thanks, Stuey. 
Rick looks up and sees a holographic image of Stuey Gluck floating in the air above him. 
RICK AHH! A phantom troll! 
He swings the log wildly at the hologram, but it keeps darting around, dodging the blows. Cowboy leans around the cubicle wall. He talks a lot like Gomer Pyle. 
COWBOY (NEIGHBORLY) Seeing phantom trolls, Rick? 
RICK (INNOCENTLY) No. 
Rick stops swinging, lamely pretends he was stretching, and ignores Stuey, who hovers around him. 
COWBOY Sounds to me like you've developed a telepathic bond. Don't mean yer nuts or nuthin'. Heck, old Nosey, why he can smell the future. Lots of us freaks got E.S.P. And Sockhead, he's got E.S.P.N. 
He points at Sockhead, who's watching pro wrestling on a portable TV. 
SOCKHEAD Watch out, Hulk! He's gonna try the skull cracker! 
COWBOY Shucks, Rick, you're lucky. Telepathy like yours only occurs between real soulmates. A bond like that should be cherished. 
Cowboy smiles and ducks back into his own cubicle. 
STUEY Wow! I'm Ricky Coogan's soulmate! 
RICK In your dreams! Now get lost, troll! 
He swings wildly at the hologram, which starts to break up and fade away. 
STUEY (FADING AWAY) Wait'll I tell the kids at school! 
Stuey disappears. Cowboy leans into Rick's cubicle again. 
COWBOY Shucksm Rick, it don't make sense to spurn your soulmate. I reckon that troll could help you if you just let him into your heart. 
Rick scoffs at him and starts whittling again. 
CUT TO: 
INT. STUEY'S ROOM - DAY 
It's a cramped room filled with Ricky Coogan memorabilia. Stuey is drawing a crude sketch of Rick on a pad. This sequence is set to brassy "man on a mission" music. 
STUEY Once America sees what happened to Ricky, they'll probably send the whole FBI down to save him! 
CUT TO: 
INT. L.A. TIMES HALLWAY 
Stuey marches towards a frosted glass door that reads "THE LOS ANGELES TIMES". 
STUEY I'll probably win a Pulitzer prize for this scoop. And I'll dedicate it to Rick! 
He walks through the door. Beat. SMASH! He comes flying out through the glass and lands on his butt. 
THE "TIME MAGAZINE" DOOR--SMASH! Stuey flies out through it. 
Elijah walks out on stage and looks at the rowdy audience. It's total mayhem. 
ELIJAH (CALMLY) Quiet, please. 
Everyone instantly sits down, shuts up, and looks up obediently at Elijah. 
ELIJAH Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, you are about to witness a cavalcade of atrocities so horrific, I advise the more sensitive members of our audience to leave the premises. 
Two SENSITIVE LOOKING MEN wearing sweaters draped over their shoulders politely get up and leave. 
ELIJAH Tonight I'm proud to announce the addition of several new monstrosities to the show, including our star attraction, the Beast Boy--an untamed and highly dangerous ghoul who's liable to go nuts and kill us all at the drop of a hat. (impressed "oohs", "ahhs", and "cools" from the AUDIENCE) But first up, prepare to behold an unspeakably repulsive yet heartwarming atrocity, Three Men and a Baby! 
THREE MEN AND A BABY, all fused into a single multi-limbed freak, walks out onstage. One of its arms holds up a dirty diaper, and all the three men hold their noses and grimace. The audience breaks into warm-hearted laughter and applause. 
BACKSTAGE 
The freaks mill around in the caged-in green room, guarded by Toad. Frogman, dressed in a magician's outfit over his wetsuit, holds an empty dove cage and searches the room, whistling for his missing dove. Nosey sneezes up a cloud of feathers. JulieErnie walk determinedly towards the adjacent Men's and Women's restrooms... BONK! They hit the wall between the two doors. 
Rick is reading his "script", rehearsing his lines. He's wearing a cheesy "jungle" costume. 
RICK Arrrggg. I am Beast Boy. I will eat you. Arrrghh. (he throws down the SCRIPT) I can't do this shit! 
He peers through the bars, scanning the audience for signs.of a rescue party. 
RICK Damn it! What's keeping those guys? 
The Worm creeps up behind Rick. 
WORM Something's troubling you, my boy. what is it? 
RICK Well, let's see. I've been kidnapped, hideously disfigured, imprisoned with a bunch of mutant freaks, my rescue party is M.I.A., and this dialogue makes "Hey Dude Three" read like "Dr. Zhivago." 
WORM I think I know what you're going through. I too had an eating disorder. You see, I've always had a feverish obsession with pudding. And when I was a young lad... 
Rick groans and looks out at the audience. 
ELIJAH 
onstage. 
ELIJAH And now a perennial favorite here at Freakland, ladies and gentlemen. I know you'll all enjoy the musical stylings of Rosie the Pinhead. 
Rosie the Pinhead struts out wearing a sexy dress and holding a microphone. After the applause dies down, she whips off her sunglasses with a flourish, revealing her extremely goofy- looking crossed eyes. She wails incomprehensibly and bonks her head with the mic. 
ROSIE (DROOLING) EEEEOOOOOOOOOOOOOIIIIIEEEEEE... 
A series of WIPES show bits of various acts as the evening WEARS ON: 
ERNIE/JULIE 
are doing a Vaudeville style stand-up routine while tap dancing. 
ERNIE Hey Julie, how many feminists does it take to screw in a light bulb? 
JULIE How many? 
ERNIE Two. One to screw it in and one to ride my Rodney! Ha-ha-ha! 
JULIE Oaf! 
She bonks him with their cane. He bonks her back. She knocks him cold. They both fall down. 
THE BEARDED LADY 
is doing a make-over demonstration. He's got a local GIRL from the audience sitting at a makeup table onstage. 
BEARDED LADY If your coloring is in the autumn range, like Maria's, try an earth tone eye makeup. Now I've done a lovely French braid on Maria, but I encourage everyone to experiment and use your imagination. The main thing is to just have fun with it. 
The audience is engrossed. Some take notes. 
SOCKHEAD 
is ringing those "tuned bells" and singing along. 
He looks at the giant head- the eyes are gone, leaving only empty eyesockets! Rick hears A BURST OF MACHINEGUN FIRE behind him, spins around and faces ... 
TWO THREE FOOT HIGH EYEBALLS 
with little arms and legs, wearing Jamaican Rasta hats and aiming smoking Uzi 9mms in the air. They aim their Uzis at Rick. One holds a walkie-talkie, the other holds a big spliff. 
RICK AHHHH! 
A T.V. MONITOR in Elijah's hands, shows Rick staring at us, the Eye's POV. 
ELIJAH 
seen in extreme close-up, watches the surveillance monitor. He speaks into a microphone. We don't see what the room looks like. 
ELIJAH Good work, Eye and Eye. 
THE EYES 
bob in response to Elijah. They have no mouths, but their pupils open and close when they speak. 
EYE AND EYE (JAMAICAN ACCENTS) Rastafari. 
ELIJAH (V.0.) (over the walkie-talkie) Now bring the Beast Boy to my, uh, den. Ha-ha-ha-ha! 
Rick looks worried as they lead him towards the scary looking house. 
INT. ELIJAH'S DEN 
It's a lovely, suburban den with a coffee table full of magazines like "Better Homes and Gardens," "National Review" and "Freaks Illustrated". Elijah sits in a big Barcalounger, smoking a pipe. Rick sits on the sofa. Toad walks up with a tray of soft drinks. 
ELIJAH (TO RICK) Diet soda? 
RICK No thanks. 
Elijah points to a bowl of Fiddle Faddle. Toad sits beside Rick. 
ELIJAH Fiddle Faddle? (Rick shakes his head) You sure? 
RICK Well, okay. (he scoops some into his MOUTH) Well, are you gonna torture me or kill me or something? 
ELIJAH Torture my greatest creation ever!? Kill the final piece of the puzzle that I've been putting together for years!? Sure, it'd be fun, but I've got a bigger plan, my boy. (MORE) ELIJAH(CONT'D) And when you ripped off that guy's head, I knew it was working like gangbusters! 
RICK But I thought I scared everyone away. 
ELIJAH Uh-huh. And then they told two friends, and they told two friends, and so on, and so on. Look at this. 
Elijah grabs a big mail bag and spills some letters out on the table. Elijah opens one and reads it. 
ELIJAH (READING) Dear Mister Skuggs, I was shocked and disgusted when my grandson told me about the head-popping beast at your show. Please send me six tickets. (he reads another) Dear Beast Boy, I used to like New Kids on The Block, but you're way cuter. My favorite ice cream is chocolate. Is it fun ripping people's heads off? I love you. (ANOTHER LETTER) The Beast Boy is on a blood-letting spree, and Oscar is along for the ride! (he looks up at Rick) That one's from Pat Collins! 
RICK Yeah, but she loves everything. 
Rick reaches for the Fiddle Faddle but the bowl is empty. Toad BURPS. 
ELIJAH Toad! That Fiddle Faddle is for guests only! You've had enough! 
Toad is blankfaced. Elijah walks over and refills the bowl. Rick scoops some into his mouth. Elijah walks to the fireplace and pushes the embers around with a poker. 
RICK Look Skuggs--Elijah--I've been in show business all my life. The public does not want to see disgusting, depraved violent filth. 
ELIJAH Oh, and I suppose Jake and the Fatman is just a fluke? 
The phone rings. Elijah looks at it, and back to Rick. 
ELIJAH (CONT'D) I'll get it. 
He goes over to the phone and lifts the receiver. 
ELIJAH `Yello? 
On the other end of the line, we hear LAUGHING MAN's insane chuckle. Elijah's smooth smile fades. He turns his back to- Rick, who strains to identify the familiar laughing voice. Elijah scribbles notes on a pad by the phone. 
ELIJAH Yes... Right... Tomorrow... Mmhmm... Mnunhmm... Wow. Okay. You got it... Hasta la vista to you too. Hahaahahaahaha-- 
ERNIE (TO JULIE) God, I can't believe he left you for a squirrel. What a dick. 
Julie's hurt. She doesn't even smack Ernie. 
RICK You know how men are. Besides, it was a pretty good looking squirrel. 
Julie looks at Rick. She sees he's trying to be helpful, not sarcastic. 
JULIE (to the others) Come on. You heard the Beast Boy. Back to the Freak House, now. 
Her eyes meet Rick's. She manages a smile, and Rick smiles back. Ernie sizes up the situation and groans as they all head back to the Freak House. 
ERNIE Not again. (TO RICK) Oh well, at least we'll get to try a new position. 
CUT TO: 
INT. STARK INTERROGATION ROOM 
We're moving in towards a door in this desolate, vaguely corporate looking hallway. 
INSIDE THE ROOM 
We're looking at the back of Laughing Man's leather chair. We hear his CACKLE, as well as STUEY GLUCK'S TORTURED SCREAMS and a horrible POWER TOOL NOISE. We can see the usual bright interrogation spotlight, and a couple of extra GOONS watching the goings on, but Stuey and his actual torturer are hidden by Laughing Man's chair. 
STUEY (O.S.) AHHHHH! STOP IT! OOOWWWWW! 
We move past Mr. Big's chair to reveal Stuey lying face down on a table, while Bob Vila is using a power sander on his butt. Bob is happily giving pointers to the two goons. 
BOB Notice the way I use an elliptical motion to chafe Stuey's buttocks. (the Goons nod ATTENTIVELY) It's all here in my new book: Pipes, Fixtures, and Torturing TROLLS-- 
LAUGHING MAN(O.S.) (Loud, sharp laugh) A-HA-HA-HAHA-HA-HA-HA! 
Bob obediently shuts up. Laughing Man directs a sinister low chuckle to Stuey. 
STUEY No way. I'll never talk! I'm made of stone! 
Bob considers this a second, then starts up a jackhammer. 
STUEY HELP! RICK! RIIIIIIIIIICCKKK! 
CUT TO: 
INT. FREAK HOUSE - DAY 
We hear LONESOME HARMONICA MUSIC as we pan past the cubicles. 
Cowboy is playing the harmonica... The Bearded Lady unties the pretty pink ribbon in his hair and sets it aside... 
Suddenly, we switch to HORRIFIC PSYCHO STINGS as the camera picks up PAUL LYNDE'S CORPSE with flashing red lights. His eyeball drips out of the socket again... 
Then it's back to the SAD HARMONICA MUSIC. In the next cubicle, Ernie is sleeping, Julie is awake, dreamily fondling a large eclair. She looks longingly up towards Rick's cubicle as we... 
DREAM DISSOLVE TO: 
DREAMLAND 
Rick (his face is normal) and Julie kiss passionately in a billowy white bed amidst puffy clouds. 
RICK (SINCERE) Julie, compared to this, sex with Julia Roberts was a thankless chore. 
QUICK DISSOLVE BACK TO: 
JULIE' 
We follow her gaze, panning up to Rick. He's lying on his bed, dreamily fondling a donut. He looks down towards Julie's cabin... 
DREAM DISSOLVE TO: 
DREAMLAND 
Rick and Julie kiss passionately. We're tight on them. 
JULIE Oh Rick, you've touched a place in me no one has ever touched before. 
He takes his seat again. 
RICK (TO EVERYONE) Tomorrow night, at the show, I'll be turned into a homicidal monster and forced to kill you all. But we might have a chance if we act fast. And I'm prepared to be your new leader. 
A THRILLING CHORD. 
NOSEY (TO SOCKHEAD) I say we kill him. 
Sockhead nods. 
RICK And I've got a plan. 
ANOTHER THRILLING CHORD. 
NOSEY I still say we kill him. 
Sockhead nods again. 
RICK If we can get into Elijah's lab, maybe we can-- 
WORM Of course! Design a super freak of our own and manipulate the genetic code to make him destroy Elijah instead of us! Brilliant! 
RICK Oh. Well-- 
BEARDED LADY But how do we get to the lab? 
RICK Um, maybe-- 
COWBOY Right! The worm could dig a tunnel! 
WORM By God, it's so crazy it might just work! 
ERNIE But you need Noxon 24 to make the freaking sludge, and Elijah told us himself he's run out of it. 
RICK Oh. Oh yeah. Well, see, what I was going to say was-- 
JULIE Yes! Exactly! If they've been using Noxon 24 as a fertilizer here, the entire ecosystem must be soaked with it! All we need is a way to extract it from the vegetation, ideally into a liquid form. 
RICK Right. Well, what about-- 
COWBOY Golly! So that's why my milk comes out that funny green color! I thought the grass tasted funny! Wow, Rick, you're a genius! 
JULIE (SMILES WARMLY) Good thinking, Rick. 
The freaks all nod in agreement. 
NOSEY Way to go, Rick! How did you ever think of such a plan? 
Rick pulls out an old comic book and points to an ad for Sea Monkeys. 
RICK Well, actually, I was going to suggest we send away for sea monkeys, train them to fire guns, and make a break for it. But if you want to go with this other thing, I guess that's okay. 
The freaks stare at him, not sure if he's kidding or not. 
CUT TO: 
INT. FREAK HOUSE - NIGHT 
FREAKS ON A MISSION MONTAGE, SET TO A POUNDING "EYE OF THE TIGER"-TYPE SONG 
-Nosey milks Cowboy, squirting the glowing milk into a funnel which feeds into a crude still. The Torch heats the boiler. 
-The Worm digs the tunnel. JulieErnie hand Rick pieces of wood which he puts into place as tunnel supports. They hand him Paul Lynde's corpse and he wedges it in as well. 
-Everyone's getting into it and working up a sweat. Nosey wipes his brow, opens a bottle of Pepsi and chugs it down in a beautifully lit slo-mo product shot... The other freaks follow suit, including the Worm, down in the tunnel, who struggles to hold the bottle in his tiny feeler. 
Everything's going great and the song is really pumping when... 
ELIJAH 
runs out on his front porch in his nightclothes and screams down at the outhouse. 
ELIJAH WOULD YOU TURN DOWN THAT GODDAMN RACKET!? 
The Worm breaks through into a small cavern with several exposed sewer pipes. A lovable mutt leaps out of a pipe and drops an old tennis ball in front of Rick. He starts licking Rick's face. 
RICK Scrappy! 
SAPPY MUSIC wells up. 
RICK It's been ten years since you chased this ball into the sewer! I thought you were gone for good! 
SCRAPPY Yap! 
RICK Listen Scrap. Go home. Get help. Understand? 
SCRAPPY Yap! 
RICK Good boy! Now go! 
Scrappy runs away into the sewer pipe. Rick shrugs. 
RICK You never know. 
Julie taps on some exposed wood on the cavern ceiling. 
JULIE Look, a wood floor. 
WORM It must be the lab! we've done it! 
They all look at each other excitedly. Suddenly Elijah's voice rings out behind them. 
ELIJAH'S VOICE Not so fast, you scabrous freaks! 
They spin around and see Nosey holding the bottle of Noxon 24. He grins. 
NOSEY Didn't know I did impressions, did ya? 
INT. FREAK HOUSE 
The freaks are waiting around the hole. Nosey pops out. 
NOSEY Mission accomplished. They've got the Noxon, and they'll be in the lab within minutes. 
FROGMAN Boy, this is going like clockwork! 
Everyone smiles, pats each other on the back, etc. Except Sockhead, who finally snaps. 
SOCKHEAD No! Can't you see we're digging our own graves!? (MORE) 
It's nuts, SOCKHEAD(cont'd) that's what it is! Nuts! Well, maybe you've all got a deathwish, but you can count me out! I'M GETTING THE HELL OUT OF HERE! 
He runs amok, pushes various freaks to the ground, and runs around screaming. The freak house door opens--Eye and Eye step in to check out the noise. One of them has a spliff sticking out of its pupil. Sockhead charges at them like a mad dog. They aim their Uzis. 
SOCKHEAD (at the Eyes) OUT OF MY WAY! 
RATTA-RATTA-RATTA! They spray an ungodly amount of bullets into Sockhead. He falls to the ground. The Eyes leave. 
The freaks gather around Sockhead. Nosey pulls the sock off his hand head, which is making a little "Senor Pepe" face with its fist. It spits up a trickle of blood and tries to speak. 
SOCKHEAD (WEAK) I... I... just... wanna...say... 
NOSEY What is it, kid? 
SOCKHEAD Ah, forget it. I'm not much for dying. 
He goes limp. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ELIJAH'S LAB 
JulieErnie, the Worm, and Rick are just emerging from the hole. It's really dark in the lab. 
ERNIE Shit. I can't see a damn thing. 
RICK Keep your voice down, Ernie. 
Rick slams his hand down for emphasis and impales it on one of those desktop paper pins. He SCREAMS in agony. 
INT. ELIJAH'S DEN 
Elijah's watching an old war movie--a soldier is running across a battlefield with a bayonet, SCREAMING. He doesn't hear Rick. 
INT. LAB 
Julie has her hand over Rick's mouth, silencing his scream. He calms down. He gingerly slides the pin out of his hand, grimacing but not making a sound. He sighs with relief. The coast seems clear. Then, in SLOW MOTION, his hand knocks a styrofoam cup off the desk and onto the ground. 
INT. ELIJAH'S DEN 
The war movie has erupted into a massive battle--machine guns blaring, grenade launchers and bazookas booming, the works. Suddenly, his ears perk up, and his head swivels around towards the window. 
ELIJAH Styrofoam cup? 
He puts on his "smiley face" robe and bunny slippers and heads out the door. 
INT. LAB 
Julie is pouring the distilled Noxon into the top of the Tasty Freekz machine. 
WORM Don't you think we should make some more pudding first, as a test? 
RICK No. Here goes. 
He presses some buttons on the computer, and the Tasty Freekz machine starts humming. Ernie is looking out the window. 
ERNIE Somebody's comin'! Hurry. 
RICK We have to wait. There's no way to speed up the machine. 
EXT. ELIJAH'S HOUSE 
Elijah comes out of the house and walks towards the lab. 
INT. LAB 
Rick's starting to sweat. He looks over at Julie, who holds an empty Pepsi cup under the Tasty Freekz spigot. A drop of ointment drips out and into the container. 
JULIE Here it comes. 
THE LAB DOORKNOB 
begins to turn slowly. 
Everybody freezes. The flow of ooze slows to a stop. 
RICK It's plugged up! 
They look over at the doorknob--it's still turning. 
ERNIE (TO WORM) If it's your damn pudding, I'll ring your wormy neck. 
WORM (under his breath) Preposterous... I have no neck. I'm a worm, imbecile. 
THE DOOR KNOB 
is still turning, agonizingly slowly... 
OUTSIDE THE LAB 
Elijah is trying to turn the knob,, His grip keeps slipping because of the butter on his fingers. 
ELIJAH Aaargh! Damn buttered popcorn! 
IN THE LAB 
The spigot has started to discharge more,reliably. The Pepsi cup is filling up now. 
OUTSIDE 
Elijah is wiping his hands off on his shirt tails. He tries the door knob again. 
RICK But we left it in the lab. 
The freaks jeer and pelt Rick with rotten vegetables. He desperately pulls a bag of cookies out of his pocket. 
RICK But wait! I found some macaroons! And there's plenty for all of us! 
The freaks burst into applause again. 
FREAKS Yaayyy! 
TIME DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. FREAK HOUSE - DAY 
The Freaks are all sleeping, macaroon crumbs still left on their faces. There's a lot of snoring. Rick awakens with a start. He hears something in the distance. Something like a helicopter... He gets up and peeks out a crack in the wall. 
RICK'S POV. EXT. FREAKLAND - DAY 
An EES corporate helicopter touches down. A few gun-toting SECURITY GUYS in dark suits and dark glasses get out. They check that the coast is clear, then give the signal. Out steps Richard Hertz. He mutters something to one of the security guys, and walks towards the Freak House. 
IN THE FREAK HOUSE 
RICK (under his breath) I don't believe it. What's Hertz doin' here? 
The door to the Freak House opens. Hertz enters, unzips his fly. Finding no toilet, he shrugs and relieves himself on the floor. Rick steps out of the shadows towards him. 
RICK So EES is in bed with Elijah C. Skuggs, eh? Figures. 
Hertz is momentarily startled by Rick. He collects himself. 
HERTZ Rick! Thank God I got to you in time! 
RICK Cut the crap, Hertz. 
Hertz relieves himself as he talks. 
HERTZ Ricky, you have no idea how your misfortune has touched our hearts. When you disappeared we almost gave up hope. But we'd heard reports of Skuggs's reckless abuse of Noxon, and when the story broke in the tabloids, I decided to personally come down and get to the bottom of things. 
He zips up and heads to the door. 
RICK (SKEPTICAL) Really? 
HERTZ No. (BEAT) AHA HA HEE HEE HO HO HA HA HEE HEE HO HO HO HA HA HA HA! 
The cackle is unmistakable--Rick's face twists in horror as he realizes... Hertz is THE LAUGHING MAN! Hertz ducks out the door. Rick looks after him, stunned. 
We hear a nearby SNORE cut off, and the Human Torch stands up from the spot where Hertz relieved himself. He's dripping wet and no longer on fire. He sniffs his soaked, smoldering clothing. 
TORCH Peuw! Hey! Of all the... That really pisses me off! 
POOF! He catches fire again and walks off. Rick is doing a slow burn, still looking after Hertz. He erupts and his monster eye glows briefly. He screams in anguish. 
RICK AAARRGGGGHH! 
Dejected, Rick leans against the wall. JulieErnie walk up behind him. Julie puts a hand on Rick's shoulder to comfort him. As they look into each other's eyes, a loud CRASH distracts them. Rick peers through the crack. 
RICK'S POV 
A caravan of EES trucks crash through the front gate and drive up to the lab. There's a few cargo trucks and a huge NOXON-24 tanker. 
RICK Holy shit. 
A forklift drives out of the back of one of the large trucks, carrying the old corporate farts on a wooden palette. 
One of them falls off, and a bunch of WORKMEN scramble out to prop him up and push him back into place. 
INT. LAB - DAY 
Elijah switches on the lights, and turns to face his audience. Hertz is accompanied by his stone-faced security men and various executives. Workmen are busy installing the old board of directors and their arm-raising pulley system. 
ELIJAH Nice to see you in the flesh, Laughing Man. 
HERTZ No need to use codenames, Elijah. We're all friends here. And just to prove it, I brought you a little present. 
ELIJAH Ha-ha. Gee, I'd love to see your plans. 
HERTZ We'd love to show you. (to his assistant) Bill, if you'd be so kind. 
BILL BLAZER, a slick and dashing EES marketing executive, strides confidently up to the podium. 
Stuey has to duck the fast approaching legs. Bill steps over him, not even noticing he's there. 
Bill takes Elijah's "Freak World" graphic off an easel, and replaces it with his own. Finding no place to deposit Elijah's, he simply drops it on the floor. Elijah looks a little hurt. 
BILL What does today's businessman want? How about a receptionist with six arms, five mouths, and a knockout figure? That'd sure speed things up, wouldn't it? 
With a big smile, Bill reveals an illustration of a multi- limb secretary (in a sexy dress) talking on three different phones, taking notes, and typing, all at once. 
Stuey heads towards the Pepsi cup. He brushes against the back of Hertz's legs. Hertz looks over at Elijah beside him, who smiles politely. Hertz smiles back, invitingly. Maybe there's a few things we don't know about him. 
BILL In the factory, how 'bout a worker with twelve busy hands, no mouth to talk back, and no genitalia or digestive system to distract him from his work? (HE CHUCKLES) Sure! It's what we all dream of! 
The EES guys all nod along. Except for the workmen, who exchange worried looks. Elijah's still not sure what to make of it all. 
Meanwhile, Stuey has the Pepsi cup of sludge in hand, and he's crawling under the table towards the door. He brushes up against the back of Elijah's legs. 
Elijah looks over to Hertz, who gives him that smile again. Elijah looks away quickly, panicky. 
BILL (CONT'D) Well, with this Skuggs-based Noxon technology, it's not only possible, it's just the beginning! Of course, what happened to our expensive spokesman Ricky Coogan was an unfortunate coincidence, but profits from these new markets could total in the billions. 
All the executives turn to Hertz. He cracks a smile. 
HERTZ Ricky who? 
The executives laugh heartily. Stuey glances across the room to the door. He has to make a break for it, so he does. 
ELIJAH Hey! Hold on! 
Stuey freezes. He's right out in the open, in plain view. Still, nobody seems to see him. They're still watching- Bill's presentation. 
ELIJAH Secretaries? Worker drones? Where's the fun? Where's the spark? Where's the unspeakable evil? 
Bill laughs pleasantly. 
BILL Ha-ha. I was just getting to that. 
Bill launches back into his speech with more intensity than even the best infomercials. Meanwhile, Stuey inches towards the door, moving as imperceptibly as possible. 
BILL We'll impact every field. COSMETICS--BREAST ENLARGEMENT creams, nosejobs in a bottle. Military--human death machines that make Schwarzenegger look like a pansy! And why stop at consumer products? Hell, we can design a whole new consumer! A few well placed drops in the water supply, and bingo! It's a new master race, and we own the copyright! An entire planet of freaks owned and operated by us! Every part of their bodies comes from an EES supplier, every thought they think is EES policy! From now on gentlemen, it's EES uber alles! EES uber alles! 
The EES guys clap and shout approval. Elijah's impressed too. He leans over to Hertz. 
ELIJAH This guy's good. 
HERTZ We lured him away from A.T.&T. 
Stuey is finally out the door. Of course, now they spot him. 
SECURITY GUY Look! The troll! 
HERTZ After him! 
EXT. LAB 
Stuey is outside the lab. Inexplicably, (actually it's just because he's so stupid) he's still moving inch by inch. He calls to Rick through the tape on his mouth. 
STUEY Mmm! Mmmmm! 
INT. FREAK HOUSE 
Rick sees the image of Stuey inching away from the lab. 
RICK Take the tape off your mouth, idiot! They didn't tie your hands! 
Stuey realizes this is true, and pulls the tape off his mouth. 
STUEY I got the cup, Rick! 
STUEY (V.0.) Rick! Over here! 
Stuey's waving cup is blocking the view of a big, annoyed BIKER sitting behind him. Elijah quiets the crowd and holds up a beaker of ointment. 
ELIJAH With this remarkable ointment of my own design, I will now turn this half-finished ghoul into the ultimate super freak, dedicated to evil! 
Elijah puts on some rubber gloves and prepares to glop Rick, who squints under the spotlight, still searching for Stuey. He calls out telepathically. 
RICK (V.0.) Stuey! Where are you?! 
Stuey stands up on his seat and waves the cup, totally blocking the biker's view. He telepathically replies. 
STUEY (V.0.) Here I am, Rick! 
BIKER (TO STUEY) Goddammit, kid! Would you sit down!? 
The biker grabs the cup and dumps it over Stuey's head. The "good ointment" runs down all over Stuey's body. 
STUEY AAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! 
All eyes turn to Stuey, who falls down and disappears onto the floor screaming. 
RICK Oh no! 
BIKER What the hell!? 
Suddenly an EIGHT FOOT TALL MONSTER VERSION OF STUEY leaps to its feet and snarls down at the biker. The biker pulls a switchblade and jams it into Stuey monster's leg--the blade crumples on his armor-like hide. Stuey grins and SLAM! He drives the biker into the ground like a railroad spike. He leaps onto the stage and stalks Elijah. 
STUEY MONSTER YOUR ASS IS MINE, SKUGGS! 
Rick and the freaks in the cage cheer stuey Monster on. 
ELIJAH Uh-oh, that kid looks pissed. EYE AND EYE! KILL HIM! 
Eye and Eye rush the stage, Uzis firing. 
EYE AND EYE RASTAFARI! 
The bullets bounce off Stuey's hide. He doinks them with his big monster fingers and sends them flying through... 
THE TENT ROOF 
across the compound, and THWOPP! Into the Giant Head's eye sockets, where they spin around and come to a stop, cockeyed. CRASH! The head's foundation crumbles and it keels over backwards. 
INT. CARNIVAL TENT 
Elijah calls out to Toad. 
ELIJAH TOAD! 
Stuey Monster roars at Toad. Toad smiles weakly. 
THE TENT ROOF 
Toad catapults through it, follows the path of Eye and Eye across the compound and CRASH! Lands head first into the neck of the Giant Head. He gets up with the Giant Head stuck on his own head, making him look like one of those big headed caricatures. He runs blindly across the yard and into... 
THE ELECTRIC FENCE 
ZZZAAAAPPP! BOINNGG! Eye and Eye zing out of the sockets, and Toad's tongue sticks ten feet out of the Giant Head's mouth. It's the biggest Tex Avery cartoon take ever! 
ELIJAH 
looks worried. He scoops up some "evil ointment". 
ELIJAH Looks like it's time to roll out the big gun. (TO RICK) Sayonara, kiddo. Any last words? 
Rick considers it. He can't think of anything. 
RICK Nahh. 
ELIJAH Suit yourself. 
He raises the ointment over Rick. Rick has an idea for a last word. 
BLAM! BLAM! The tent flaps fly open and a half dozen FBI AGENTS rush in with guns drawn. 
FBI CHIEF Freeze, FBI! 
Another FBI GUY investigates the dunk tank, sees Elijah's hat floating on top of the bubbling ooze. 
ANOTHER FBI GUY Looks like they took care of Skuggs, chief. 
The chief nods. They put away their guns, and approach Rick and the rest of the jubilant freaks. 
CHIEF Nice work, Ricky. You'll get a medal from the Vice President for this. 
RICK Great. But how did you-- 
CHIEF We've been following Skuggs for years. Scrappy just filled in some of the details. 
SCRAPPY Yap! 
FBI CHIEF Thank heavens you brought him to justice, Rick. God only knows how far his sick plans would've gone. 
ANOTHER FBI GUY Hey chief, look at this! 
The FBI guy has peeled the decal off the Pepsi machine, revealing that it's actually a Coke machine! The chief is sickened to the core. 
FBI CHIEF Is nothing sacred? 
Suddenly, the agents are distracted by a terrible scream. They turn to the dunk tank and are shocked by what they see. 
FBI CHIEF Oh, my Lord! 
RICK No! It can't be! 
We SWISH PAN over to reveal a DRIPPING BLOB climbing out of the dunk tank. The blob separates into two distinct entities with their backs to us. They turn around and...my God it's... it's.... 
REGIS AND KATHIE LEE! 
Or at least a damn fine mutant imitation of them. Call him/them ELIJUS and ELLY LEE. They both have glowing red demon eyes and speak in Elijah's voice. 
ELIJUS Thought you killed me, huh? 
ELLY LEE What the hell are you looking at? 
FBI CHIEF Two pieces of deadmeat! 
BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! The FBI guys open fire. We show only the horrified reactions of the freaks as they look on. 
CUT TO: 
INT. REGIS AND KATHIE LEE SET 
Rick, Regis, and Kathie Lee are still in silhouette. 
RICKY And that's my story. 
KATHIE LEE (YAWN) It was so exciting! 
REGIS And long! My God! It makes War and Peace sound like a warm up act! 
CREW GUY(O.S.) Okay! We got light! 
REGIS It's fixed? Well, it's about time! 
The lights come on--no more silhouettes. Ricky looks perfectly normal, his old self. His weird silhouette was caused by a potted plant and some strange hanging mobile behind him. 
RICKY That's better. 
REGIS I'll say. (TO AUDIENCE) How 'bout it, folks. Let's hear it for Ricky Coogan! 
The audience applauds and hoots wildly. 
KATHIE LEE Can we bring out the other freaks now? 
The audience cheers as the rest of the Freaks walk out from the wings, and stand off to the side waving to the audience. They all look clean cut and happy. They wear T-shirts with their former identities printed on them. "I was NOSEY," "I was COWBOY," "I was the BEARDED LADY" etc. Except the Worm, who's still a worm. His T-shirt says, "I'm Still THE WORM".

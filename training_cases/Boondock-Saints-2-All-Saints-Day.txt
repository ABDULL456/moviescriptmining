EXT. BOYLESTON STREET, BOSTON -- MORNING 
The boulevard is empty, eerie silence. No cars, no people. A man walks down the middle of the street, long trench, dark shades. Though he does not speak, we hear... 
MAN V.O. There's two kinds of people in this world when you boil it all down. You got your talkers and you got your doers. 
We recognize this man as ROCCO. He crosses Copley Square toward the looming dome of the Trinity Church. 
ROCCO V.O. Most people are just talkers. All they got is talk. But when all's said and done, it is the doers who change the world. And when they do that, they change us. That's why we never forget them...So, which one are you? Do you just talk about it? Or do you stand up and do something about it? Because believe you me all the rest of it is just coffee house bullshit. 
FADE TO BLACK... 
EXT. DEEP COUNTRYSIDE -- DAY 
SUBTEXT:   "Ireland" 
From behind we see two men perched atop a boulder. A flock of sheep encircles them. Their army sacks and shotguns are nearby. They roll their own cigarettes with effortless synchronicity and light up. CONNOR and MURPHY MacMANUS (30's) now have long hair with heavy facial growth. Rugged. Piercing eyes. Looking to the horizon... 
MURPHY Looks like a storm's comin'. 
CONNOR Aye. 
EXT. FIELDS -- LATER 
MOODY MUSIC: The brothers drive the flock across jewel green hills. Murphy cuts a sheep from a thicket and sets it off. 
POPPA M V.O. Peace, they say, is the enemy of memory. So it had been for my boys. 
Connor shares some jerky with a sheep dog as the flock surges. 
POPPA M V.O. (CONT'D) For some time now, their past had felt like a dream to them...faded and worn. 
Murphy touches the faded Celtic Cross tattoo on his forearm. Connor sees. The music takes us to a secluded, pioneer-esque ranch. 
CLOSE ON: POPPA M's (58yrs) face as he coughs and watches his sons approach from his rocking chair on the porch. 
POPPA M V.O. (CONT'D) And then suddenly, as if not a day had passed...it was back. I could see it in their eyes. 
INT. FARMHOUSE -- NIGHT 
Poppa M and his sons eat a rustic dinner.   It storms outside. 
POPPA M V.O. I could feel it, heavy in their presence. Something calling them back. 
Poppa M looks to his boys who just keep eating. DIP TO BLACK... 
INT. FARMHOUSE, FRONT PORCH -- NEXT MORNING 
Very early dawn, shadowy morning light. Connor and Murphy sip coffees and look out into the rain. Lightening lights up the flock. 
Through the open door behind them, Poppa M stokes a warm fire. 
Connor touch the Celtic Cross tattoo on his forearm. The boys look at each other as the rain suddenly stops and all the "little sounds" of morning cease. Something's amiss. Thunder. Ominous music as... 
EXT. BOSTON, TRINITY CHURCH -- NIGHT 
From behind, we see a man with a CREW CUT, staring at the dome of the Trinity. 
SLO-MO, CLOSE ON: Crew Cut's boots as he paces toward.    The threatening music bleeds over to... 
EXT. FARM -- MOMENTS LATER 
Just inside the trees, a pack of wolves stalk the sheep flock... 
SLO-MO, CLOSE ON:   A wolf's paws as it paces toward... 
We intercut between BOSTON and IRELAND as chaos erupts... 
BOSTON:    Crew Cut quickly enters the church. 
IRELAND:    The wolves burst from the tree line. 
BOSTON: A frantic priest in his 50's weeps and begs as Crew Cut slams him to his knees with a .9 mm to his head. 
IRELAND:   The wolves savagely attack the screaming sheep. 
BOSTON:    Muzzle flash, blood splatters on the altar. 
EXT. RAPID FLASHBACK SEQUENCE, "ACCESSORY TO MURDER" 
Greenly, disguised as a correctional officer, lets Connor, Murphy and Poppa M out of a paddywagon. FLASH! 
The Saints enter the Suffolk Courthouse, undetected.   FLASH! 
Dolly, dressed as a civilian, pulls the fire alarm.    FLASH! 
The Saints execute Poppa Joe Yakavetta before many terrified witnesses, the alarm blaring in the b.g. FLASH! 
INT. BACK TO PRESENT, VESTIBULE -- MOMENTS LATER 
GREENLY ...and not just fucked, like elephant dick, pounded in the ass, no reach around, jungle fucked! 
DUFFY Now's not the time to panic, Green beans! 
GREENLY Oh, I disagree. Now's the perfect time to panic. We're all Accessories to... 
DOLLY Don't you fucking say it! 
They all argue over one another. OFFICER #1 peaks his head in the front door. The detectives grind to a halt. 
OFFICER #1 Her E.T.A. is ten minutes. 
EXT. GRAVEYARD -- MORNING 
CLOSE ON:   a gravestone.   "Paul M. Smecker,    1956 - 2003" 
We reveal a pair of sexy female legs, expensive "Jimmy Choo" heels. From behind we see the woman rest a rose at Smecker's Grave. "Legs" turns and walks toward a waiting squad car in b.g. 
EXT. CHURCH -- MOMENTS LATER 
Dolly, Duffy and Greenly stand outside in the entry way of the church. Though still on edge, they have calmed. 
DOLLY I didn't even know he had a protege. What is this bullshit? 
Duffy whips out his trusty note pad. 
DUFFY Special Agent Eunice Bloom, 32 years old. Smecker plucked her right out of class at Quantico. 
GREENLY Smecker hand picked her? Aw, man. This brawd's gonna be a nightmare. 
DUFFY She was assigned to OCD two years back. She can shoot a gun, set three course records during her training. 
GREENLY Great. A bull dike, Annie Oakley wanna- be. We gotta get rid of her. 
DUFFY She is also an authority on the Saints case. Which means Smecker must have walked her through it. 
The cops suddenly flush with fear. 
DOLLY And the hits just keep on comin'. 
INT. FARMHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER 
Sibeal waits as Poppa M thinks, then shakes his head. 
POPPA M Naw...I'm in no condition.   I'd just slow 'em down. 
SIBEAL Well, are ya at least gonna try ta talk them out of this? 
Poppa M shakes his head. 
SIBEAL (CONT'D) We don't even know what this is yet! Somebody could just be tryin' ta get away with murder here! 
POPPA M Aye. Only there's about a thousand easier ways ta do that. Trust me. Someone's callin' them out, Sibeal. Ya kill a priest in a church and make it look like they did it. Bring 'em back with a vengeance. Don't know who. Don't know why. But someone thinks he's real fuckin' clever. Only one problem with his little plan. 
SIBEAL What's dat? 
POPPA M It worked. 
Fear and frustration burst from Sibeal. 
SIBEAL Jesus Christ! D'er's too much we don't know and if you're won't at least try ta talk some sense into them, I will! 
The door opens and in comes Connor and Murphy. Sibeal notes the change in appearance. The boys stand at the kitchen table's opposing end, hands in their pockets. Their resolve fills the room. 
The brothers face off with Poppa M and Sibeal: a bizarre board meeting. Poppa M cocks a brow at Sibeal who clears his throat. 
SIBEAL (CONT'D) Exactly what do you intend to do? 
Silence. Nobody moves. Connor withdraws a hand from his pocket and looks down. He flips a penny on the table. It clatters to a stop. 
MURPHY Every last motherfucker that had anything to do with it. 
EXT. CHURCH -- LATER 
EUNICE Let's go with the venue first. Our perpetrators are devout. They would never commit such an act on sacred ground. And as for the victim? 
DOLLY All their vics were criminals. Clearly not the case here. So, it wasn't them which means this is a local matter and it falls under our jurisdiction. No need for Federal involvement so with all due respect...we'll see you later, Special Agent Bloom. 
Eunice stands right in front of Dolly. 
EUNICE Man, I hate it when people say that. "With all due respect." Because it is inevitably followed by a disrespectful remark. I'll give you an example. With all due respect, Detective, this matter falls under whatever jurisdiction I fuckin' say it does. 
Dolly fumes.   Duffy and Greenly share an "oh shit" look. 
DUFFY Uh, so...let's just...what can you tell us about the shooters? 
EUNICE Shoo-ter. Singular. And I can tell you that he is left handed and how shall I put this delicately...? He's a short bastard. 
DOLLY 
(FACETIOUS) One guy, lefty, short.   Got it. 
Eunice furrows her brow. 
EUNICE I'll show you what I'm talking about. 
INT. CHURCH, ALTAR -- MOMENTS LATER 
Close up on Greenly's enraptured face. We pull back and see he is on his knees before Eunice and staring longingly between her legs. 
EUNICE Detective Greenly, you're the victim. 
GREENLY David.   You can call me David. 
EUNICE Very well, David. 
Duffy and Dolly stand behind Greenly, chest to chest, each mimicking guns to the back of the kneeling cop's head. 
EUNICE (CONT'D) The Saints' signature stance. Copley Plaza Hotel four years ago. Two men of identical height put Yuri Petrova on his knees and each dropped iron to the back of his head. 
This is torture for Greenly and he turns his head from Eunice's crotch. She immediately adjusts him back into place. 
EUNICE (CONT'D) Eyes front, David. The position of the victim and the angles produced by the killers' stance created a unique scenario. The bullets criss crossed in the skull and exited the eye sockets. Here, this did not occur. The rounds moved on a straight trajectory through the back of the victim's head and out the front. Which happens when... 
Eunice circles around, positioning herself between Dolly and Duffy. She aims both hands to the back of Greenly's head. 
DUFFY ...one guy's holding two guns to the back of your head. 
EUNICE One guy. 
INT. FLASHBACK, CHURCH -- NIGHT BEFORE 
Crew Cut holds two guns to the back of the pleading priest's head. He fires and McKinney falls. Crew Cut steps forward and we see his face in the light. Piercing, ice blue, sociopathic eyes. WHIP PAN! 
INT. BACK TO PRESENT, CHURCH -- MOMENTS LATER 
EUNICE Now, the victim falls forward.   If you please, David. 
Greenly lays flat on his stomach. 
EUNICE (CONT'D) The killer approached the body from the left side... (Eunice approaches) ...and flipped him to the right. 
DUFFY Left handed. 
EUNICE Yep, southpaw. 
INT. FLASHBACK, CHURCH -- NIGHT BEFORE 
Crew Cut flips the body, showing little respect. He pulls out two pennies and looks at them. He chuckles. WHIP PAN... 
INT. BACK TO PRESENT, CHURCH -- MOMENTS LATER 
DOLLY But you said he was wicked short. 
EUNICE The Saints were later determined to be five foot eleven inches tall. It's just dumb luck that the Russian and McKinney are the exact same height. 
Eunice kneels, putting her pointer fingers just below Greenlys eyes. 
EUNICE (CONT'D) The rounds exited Petrova's eye balls. Here they came out the lower cheek. 
She slides her fingers to Greenly's lower cheeks.    He's putty. 
EUNICE (CONT'D) Three, four inches below the eyes. 
DOLLY That puts him at five, seven-ish. That's not uncommonly short. 
Eunice stands and points the a broken down confessional booth door. 
EUNICE The killer posed as a late night confessor. Once the victim entered the booth the killer had him isolated. No escape. Short stuff exits his confessional and kicks in the door of the priest's chamber... 
ROMEO Oh...I'd be more inclined to go with something like, "THAT DOESN'T GO THERE, 
MAN!" 
They laugh as they move to the semi-conscious Frenchman. 
LOW ANGLE:    looking up at our trio, Romeo is in the middle. 
ROMEO (CONT'D) We saved your entire fucking country in World War Two! Gee...thanks for the statue! 
Romeo's foot smashes to camera, blacking us out. 
INT. VESSEL, BERTH -- NIGHT 
The boys slumber, side by side in hammocks.     We pull close on them. Silence. They whisper in unison... 
BOTH Quis praesumis profanus apud Dominus? 
(SUBTITLES) Who dares trespass in the house of God? 
Their eyes pop open. 
INT. BERTH -- LATER 
Murphy rigs a needle to an ink pen. Connor clicks on a hot plate. The boys listen intently to a tiny hand radio nearby. 
RADIO ANNOUNCER V.O. People are still in shock as Father McKinney was a beloved local cleric. 
(MORE) 
RADIO ANNOUNCER V.O. (CONT'D) His selfless contributions to the community too numerous to list. In related news, second generation crime boss, Concezio Yakavetta has not commented on whether he fears for his own safety. 
The boys flash with recognition. 
BOTH Yakavetta? 
INT. HIGH CLASS HOME, DINING ROOM -- NIGHT 
Rich, Italian decor, long table, laden with food. CAPOS 1-6 sit in utter shock, looking to their boss, CONCEZIO YAKAVETTA (37yrs) who heads the table. 
CONCEZIO So, there it is. I want everyone to feel free to share their thoughts. 
He returns to eating. A moment of silence then the Capos burst into anger. Capo #1 slams a fist down and stands, silencing the lot. 
CAPO #1 I can't believe none of us were consulted on this! The disrespect! We'd have never okay'd such a thing!   A priest! It's an infamita! 
CAPO #2 Yeah! Are we not Catholics, for Christ fucking sakes?! 
CAPO #3 And just for simple revenge?! There's no business in it! You've put us all at risk here! The cops could be all over us! 
CAPO #4 Forget the cops! What about these Saints fuckers?! These guys were long gone! And now you're trying to bring the devil right back to our doorstep?! 
Concezio wipes his mouth, stands and adjusts his cuffs.   He slowly circles the table as he speaks. 
CONCEZIO Six years ago, with the backing of an adoring public, these vigilante fucks put my father on his knees and executed him...in public. Mi Patrigno, a blood relative and benefactor to all of you. Poppa Joe made you rich and his murder remains un-revenged... 
A few roll their eyes at this verbal blunder. 
CONCEZIO (CONT'D) This too, is infamita. These homicidal maniacs nearly wiped this family out. It's taken a lot of time to build ourselves up again, brick by brick. And now that we've re-acquiesced our original power, can we really afford to have these guys pop out of the woodwork someday and try to finish the job when we least expect it? Now, for those of you who have forgotten, let's recap. These fuckers walk into rooms full of gangsters... (denotes surroundings) Outnumbered, outgunned. They kill everyone...and leave. 
Some look as if they are starting to get his point. 
CONCEZIO (CONT'D) You think I don't know that each one of you's been waking up in night sweats over this the last couple years? These sons of bitches prison fucked us with no lube, wiped their dicks on our drapes and walked away! And we been living in silent fear ever since. Oh, we don't talk about it. Rape victims often don't. But it's there. Knowing they're still out there, somewhere. Thinking...what if? 
Fear and realization. 
CAPO #4 Concezio is right. Pretending you don't got a problem don't solve nothing. 
Heads nod in shameful agreement. 
CONCEZIO Thank you, Doctor Phil. So, let's take a moment to look at the serendiplious, diperous, serendip... 
(FRUSTRATION) ...type situation we find ourselves in here. There's a good chance they'll show. No catching us with our pants down this time. We can deal with them proactivitously. The cops were embarrassed by these guys too. With a second bite at the apple, they got every reason in the world to crank up the heat. And as for their doting public. I'd imagine they're gonna lose a few fans. 
Heads nod all around.   Sold. 
INT. BERTH -- LATER 
Murphy sits, bare chested on a crate. With the rigged pen, he tattoos his brother's back. Connor cooks something, in a pot, on the hot plate. The resin of anger is evident. 
TATTOOS: Murphy's back has the crucified feet of Christ and Connor's shows Christ's downcast head on the cross. 
CONNOR The prodigal son, huh?   He wants us, he's fuckin' got us. 
MURPHY But why would he do something so public? 
The boys laugh, snatch the bottle.   Romeo is in shock. 
ROMEO That shit was NOT funny, man! 
The brothers laugh harder. Romeo rolls on his side and slides a hand down the back of his pants. He seems relieved. 
ROMEO (CONT'D) Oh, thank you, Jesus. Thought I greased my drawers. 
INT. BERTH -- LATER 
The boys and Romeo smoke and pass the bottle around. 
CONNOR No. 
ROMEO But I got conex all over Bean Town. Romeo'll hook you up like a tow truck! 
MURPHY No. 
ROMEO Why not?! 
MURPHY We don't hafta give you reasons. Forget it. 
ROMEO It's because I'm Mexican, isn't it! 
CONNOR How dare you, sir, insinuate such a thing? The fact that you're a greasy spic's got nothin' ta do with it. 
The boys laugh. 
ROMEO I'm gonna let you have that one. Look. I can do this. It's not rocket science. You two find bad guys doing bad shit and you kill them, right? 
CONNOR It's not that simple. 
MURPHY Yes it is. 
CONNOR S'pose you're right. I'd sorta hoped we were a little more artistic than that. 
ROMEO Well, you ain't. Can't you guys see it? This shit's fate, man. Like preordained type shit. Mea fucking Culpa! Why do you think you just happened to be in that hatchway today? 
MURPHY Oh, don't start gettin' all super fuckin' natural on us. We saw those guys goin' in there! 
ROMEO Ah, ha! That's what you say. I say it's because Jeeeeesus wanted it that way! 
CONNOR Oh, no. 
ROMEO Fine. Then what exactly do you intend to do when you hit U.S. soil? 
CONNOR We'll go after all Yakavetta's people and operations till we get to the man himself. 
MURPHY Yeah, work our way up the food chain. 
The brothers seem pleased with themselves. 
ROMEO So, what's your first gig?    What's the first thing you gonna do? 
The boys look to one another.   They're stumped. 
CONNOR Well, I don't suppose we have a succinct plan, y'know, per se. 
MURPHY Yeah. It's not fully developed yet, y'know, as it were. 
A slow smile splits Romeo's face. 
ROMEO You two need to chill in the green room, sip on some Pellegrinos and let your manager handle the details. And you better get my Cub Scout badge ready. Cuz if you want to kick Yakavetta in the nuts, let him know you're in town...Romeo's got an ace in the hole for you. 
INT. / EXT. NEWS FOOTAGE, MAN ON THE STREET INTERVIEWS 
HOT DOG VENDOR These guys have gone "mad dog" here. They need to be put down. 
CAB DRIVER I think it's disgusting.   I wish they'd have stayed gone. 
PEDESTRIAN I don't believe it for a second!   No bleep-in way the Saints did it! 
INT. BOSTON P.D., WAR ROOM -- MORNING 
The CHIEF (50's) sits, arms folded. The detectives are present. Eunice stands before a wall adorned with crime scene photos, reports, Concezio and his Capos. 
EUNICE And that's all she wrote. Everything points in the same direction. 
She taps Yakavetta's picture on the wall. 
CHIEF Why would Yakavetta want them back here? Him of all people. 
DUFFY To have them executed. Revenge. Oldest motive in the book. 
GREENLY The Saints killed his daddy six years ago, right? He was inside when that happened doing a nickel for extortion. 
ROMEO Hey! I hail from a colorful people. Besides, you wouldn't know style if it pitched a tent in your ass! (looks into rear view) What do you think of the ride, Conman? 
CONNOR The only way I could be more embarrassed right now is if I was ridin' a moped. 
MURPHY Yeah...while fuckin' a fat girl. 
CONNOR Yeah...rollin' through the gym at my high school reunion. 
ROMEO All right!   I get the fucking point! 
INT. WAREHOUSE -- LATER 
CHINESE GANGSTERS #1-#5, shovel mounds of coffee grounds out of crates and pull kilos of white powder. Machinery noise in b.g. 
EXT. WAREHOUSE -- SAME TIME 
CLOSE ON:   Three sets of eyes peaking over oil drums. 
Our trio watches as a DOCK WORKER (22yrs) drives a forklift, unloading the crates from the flatbed and driving them through the huge open bay doors. The boys and Romeo huddle up. 
CONNOR O'kay, here's the plan. 
EXT. "THE PLAN," WAREHOUSE -- NIGHT 
The "Queen" classic, Another One Bites the Dust, presides over this fantasy sequence. The boys, looking more "quaffed," do a pointless slow motion walk toward the forklift, throwing up their collars. 
Romeo, also looking polished, executes a "Dan Tana" pistol whipping on the Dock Worker who perfectly out of frame. 
INSIDE WAREHOUSE: The lift pulls to a stop before the gangsters, crate on the forks. Romeo is behind the wheel. 
SLO-MO: Connor and Murphy pop from the crate and fire on their Asian foe, hitting each squarely in the chest. 
SLO-MO: The boys leap down and light cigs as Romeo does the "one arm action star hang" off the side of the lift in b.g. WHIP PAN... 
EXT. WAREHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER 
CONNOR We skin out, go ta Doc's for a shot of Irish. We're home in time for tacos. 
Murphy looks unsure.     Connor turns to his brother. 
CONNOR (CONT'D) What? 
MURPHY Well, it's...uh...you know, it's... 
ROMEO It's genius. I can even drive an F- lift, man. Got my class "D" license and everything. 
CONNOR Now, dat's the spirit. 
ROMEO I need a gun. 
CONNOR AND MURPHY Forget it. 
ROMEO What the fuck? I'm in on this shit, man! I'm working here! 
The boys look to each other. Murphy shrugs. Relenting, Connor pulls a metallic object and shoves it in Romeo's hand. 
CONNOR You can consider yourself a fuckin' pledge until we say different. 
Romeo holds up the gun in displeasure, a tiny .22 caliber lady's purse pistol. Murphy snickers. 
ROMEO Can I consider myself your girlfriend, too? 
CONNOR That's what you get.   Is there a problem? 
ROMEO (beat, fuming) It's fine. 
Connor scopes the warehouse.   Murphy claps Romeo on the shoulder. 
MURPHY Don't worry, Rome.   Shit like this builds character. 
ROMEO Yeah, the character of a little bitch. 
MURPHY Now, dat's just unprofessional. 
He turns and joins his brother as Romeo continues sulking. 
MURPHY (CONT'D) What do we think? 
CONNOR I think Yakavetta murdered a good man just to send us a message. 
MURPHY Well...let's send him one back. 
As they spirit themselves off.   DISSOLVE TO... 
INT. WAREHOUSE -- LATER 
Doc turns on the lights and they all enter. There is a far more ornate and ancient bar up here: gothic pool table, dusty boxes, cots set up, blankets, towels, hot-plate etc. 
THE BROTHERS Holy shit. 
DOC The place used ta be an old speak easy in the forties. I only use it for storage, now. 
Murphy is already opening a bottle of Irish. 
ROMEO This is so fucking cool. 
DOC Nobody even knows it's up here. You'll be safe. 
(POINTS) You can get in and out the fu-fu-fire escape. 
ROMEO You know what this is? This is our hide out, man! We got a hide out! 
CONNOR What are you, fucking five years old? 
MURPHY Hey, Rome, we got sheets and broomsticks. You could build yourself a fort. 
ROMEO Fuck the both of you! 
INT. "HIDE OUT PARTY MONTAGE" -- NIGHT 
Festive music. A brisket boils on the hot-plate. Romeo and the boys drink and relate the evening's antics to Doc. Dissolve to... 
Later, they all enjoy an impromptu dinner on the pool table. The eating does not slow their banter and laughter. Dissolve to... 
Later, music fades. Silence as Connor and Doc stare each other down across the pool table. Neither flinches. Murphy and Romeo watch with intrigue as Doc stiffles his urge to pop off. 
DOC 
(CONCENTRATION) Not this time, ya little shit. 
CONNOR We'll see, old man. 
A moment passes and Doc is literally shaking. 
CONNOR (CONT'D) Would somebody please come over here and... 
DOC 
FUCK! 
CONNOR ...me up the... 
DOC 
ASS! The boys and Romeo burst into hysterics.   Doc rages. 
EXT. / INT. "BELLA SANTE SALON" -- MORNING 
Eunice enters the swanky salon and moves across the lobby. 
INT. MASSAGE ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER 
"Gorgeous" GEORGE (47yrs) is face down as a female masseuse works his back, incense, mood music. Eunice silently slides in flashing her badge, a finger to her pursed lips. 
Uneasy, the woman continues her work as Eunice lotions her hands. She covertly replaces the masseuse and motions her out of the room. Eunice digs in as the fatted mobster moans with pleasure. 
GEORGE Oh, yeah.     Someone's been eating their Wheaties.     Yeah, get after it, girl. 
Eunice grabs a large massage paddle with rubber fingers. She whips George's towel off, winds up and smacks him on his bare ass, HARD!! 
GEORGE (CONT'D) 
AAAAAH! 
George involuntarily jerks and rolls off the table. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) 
WHAT THE FUCK!? 
He bolts to his feet. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) You fucking bitch! 
He rounds the massage table, arms outstretched. Eunice draws her side arm and sticks it in his face, halting him dead. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
EUNICE What did you just call me? 
GEORGE Who are you? 
Back in the Green Machine - an excruciating amount of time passes. Murphy tries to break the ice. 
MURPHY Hey, uh, maybe we should... 
CONNOR Shut up.   Romeo's crying. 
A moment of silence....then all three burst into laughter. 
ROMEO You fucking assholes! 
INT. PRUDENTIAL BUILDING, LUXURY APARTMENT -- DAY 
A sprawling high rise apartment, overlooking Boston: buffet table, plasma screen, etc. The Capos are taking advantage of the amenities. Concezio's not here. Capo #5 - #6 fill their plates... 
CAPO #5 That shipment of "H" was gonna square our books for six months. Shit. 
CAPO #6 We always bounce back. Besides, look at the bright side. Better the chinks than us, right. 
CAPO #5 I guess.  Like the boss said... (Concezio impression) "This is war. There's gonna be casuwalities." 
They laugh. Suddenly, George enters with an overnight bag.      The Capos are confused. Feigning a capitol mood... 
GEORGE Oh! Like the Roman Empire in here! Where's all the concubines and shit? 
George laughs. Nobody else does. He looks at the food table.      We pull close on shrimp cocktail and cannoli. A look of dread. 
CAPO #3 George.    What gives, here? 
GEORGE I need to see the Boss, right away. 
CAPO #4 Jimmy the Gofer! 
In hustles JIMMY THE GOFER (20's), skinny, weak looking. 
CAPO #2 (to Jimmy) Il cortina. 
Jimmy draws back a large curtain, exposing a steel panic room. Next to the vault door, is a video screen which displays the unamused face of Concezio. His voice booms over loudspeakers. 
CONCEZIO Get over here! 
GEORGE Whoa! 
George hustles over.   He stands before the screen, confused. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) Uh.   Hey, Boss! I just came by to...! 
CONCEZIO Push the talk button, numb nuts. 
GEORGE Oh. (he does) Can you here me? Over. 
CONCEZIO I can hear you fine, Smokey and the Bandit. Now, what the fuck are you doing here? 
GEORGE Everything's in motion. All our guys are gunning for these Jesus Freaks. I figure, no need for me to be on the streets no more. So, which room do I take, eh? 
CONCEZIO You stupid motherfucker! I told you, you're on the streets till this is over! Now get the fuck outta here! 
A terrified George hustles for the door. 
CONCEZIO (CONT'D) And don't come back here till I tell you to, you fat fucking waste of space! 
George trips over his luggage.   The Capos giggle. 
INT. HOTEL ROOM -- EVENING 
Cheap, depressing room. Crew Cut, in his underwear, repairs a broken rosary chain with string and puts it on.He pulls a shoe box from a shopping bag. The brand is "Hushes." Slogan: "Measure up to your dreams." 
He puts on one shoe. Crew Cut stands before the mirror going up and down on the one shoed foot, noting the height that has been added. The shoe has been cleverly constructed to disguise the higher heel. 
EXT. AUTO BODY -- EVENING 
We are out back, among scrap cars. George talks with JO JO RHAMA (38yrs). Jo Jo is built like a fire plug and clearly a hoodlum. 
JO JO A priest.   The sick fuck. 
GEORGE And he leaves all of us on the streets holding the bag while him and his are living it up at the Taj fuckin' Majal, not a care in the world. 
JO JO So, until the Saints get popped, we're all lambs to slaughter? 
GEORGE Yeah! And he don't care how many of us they wipe out in the meantime! 
JO JO What do you need me to do, Skipper? 
GEORGE Spread the word to all the brugliones. No bullshit. From your mouth to their ears. 
JO JO Everyone? North and South?   That could get a little dicey. 
MURPHY Look at that. 
We see Murphy's finger denote a bad "airbrush" job. 
MURPHY (CONT'D) That's an arm. 
Connor looks close. 
CONNOR Oh...that's fuckin' harsh. 
The boys look at one another, then bust out laughing. 
MURPHY Y'er one of a kind, Roc. 
ROMEO So, am I as good as this guy, or what? 
CONNOR You, sir, are no David Della Rocco. 
A sound. Instantly, the boys turn and level weapons. There stands ROY (32yrs) thick glasses, geeky. He drops his flowers. 
ROY Whoa!  Whoa! Whoa! Holy shit! (beat, recognition) HOLY SHIT! You're the Saints! I'm Roy, it's an honor. Huge fan! 
The boys reholster and look to one another.    Disapproval. 
CONNOR We're developin' quite the cult following in the old neighborhood. 
The boys continue to chat with Roy as Romeo answers his cell. 
ROMEO Que pasa. 
It's Cesar. 
CESAR I got that info you wanted, mijo. 
INT. TANNING SALON -- NIGHT 
The Salon Manager approaches the back door with keys in hand. 
CESAR V.O. The place is Tropical Tan on Bunker Hill. It's where the fat fucking juedo gets his fake bake at. He's got a secret appointment. Once a week, never misses. Eight o'clock, tonight. 
The Manager lets George slip in. He steels into a tanning room.A Mexican towel boy has spied George. He picks up a phone... 
INT. MAUSOLEUM -- MOMENTS LATER 
Romeo snaps his phone shut and turns to the boys. 
ROMEO We got him. 
ROY (re: Romeo) Who's this, your new sidekick? (extends hand) Pleased to meet you. I'm Roy. 
ROMEO How would you like me to sidekick you in the ass, Roy? 
CONNOR 
(GIGGLING) Let's go. 
The three walk for the door, leaving Roy behind. 
ROY I, I didn't mean to... 
ROMEO I'm sick of this shit! I've been breaking my balls, here and I get second banana billing! I... 
MURPHY I, I, I. There is no "I" in team, ya selfish prick. 
ROMEO Yeah?!   Well, there's an "I" in "Fuck you! 
EXT. GRAVEYARD -- MOMENTS LATER 
Moody music as our trio walks through the gravestones. 
INT. "TROPICAL TAN," TANNING ROOM -- NIGHT 
The brothers and Romeo sneak up to the tanning bed. George sings a Sinatra tune as his fat stomach props the cover up like a half open clamshell. Suddenly, Murphy leaps up and sits on the cover. George is being crushed beneath his weight. Connor kneels. 
CONNOR Lovely voice. We'd like ya ta sing for us. What do ya say? George struggles and nods. Murphy hops off. George spills out, hot pink Speedos. On all fours and breathing heavy... 
GEORGE It's getting hard to be a fucking gentleman of leisure, here! 
The boys pull weapons and throw him against the wall in a Jesus Christ pose, pinning his hands with their guns. 
MURPHY We want the shooter you motherfuckers used on that priest. 
GEORGE I don't know who it is. 
The boys cock back the hammers on their weapons. 
Everyone calms. S.S. Bruglione #3 gives a respectful nod to the Northside guys but sits with his own. 
INT. EL CAVA, KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER 
We do not see George just below frame as the boys are "working on him" in some way, putting on finishing touches. Romeo barrels in. 
ROMEO These dagos are getting antsy and I'm getting Spicaroo'd and Pepe'd. The kid's about to go Poncho fucking Villa out there! 
CONNOR Stick it out. Waitin' on one more. 
EXT. PARKING LOT -- MOMENTS LATER 
Jo Jo exits his Cadillac and walks toward El Cava.   There is a "closed for private function" sign on the door. 
INT. JACKED UP SUV, NEARBY -- SAME TIME 
Crew Cut watches Jo Jo.   He dials his cell. 
INT. GREENHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER 
From behind we see the Old Man gardening.    He answers a ringing phone, nearby. We do not see his face. 
INT. SUV -- MOMENTS LATER 
The following conversation is in Italian. 
CREW CUT He is not with them. 
OLD MAN Are you certain? 
CREW CUT Yes. It is only the sons. They have a Spaniard with them. They will slaughter everyone. 
OLD MAN Let them. If you kill the sons...the father will come. 
Crew Cut develops a sinister smile. 
INT. EL CAVA, KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER 
Connor watches Jo Jo greet the others.    He turns to Romeo who is angrily cooking up a storm. 
CONNOR The gang's all here. 
Without missing a beat, Romeo slams the hot pans into a dish sink. He stands fuming with his hands on his hips. 
ROMEO Gimme my fucking bee bee gun. 
MURPHY Naw.   You've earned your stripes, Rome. 
Murphy throws him a .9 mm.   Romeo smiles. 
INT. BAR -- MOMENTS LATER 
JO JO So....where's Gorgeous? 
Suddenly, George comes rolling out of the kitchen, unconscious and tied, face down, to a bus cart. There is writing on his back. Everyone pulls their weapons and moves toward. 
N.S. BRUGLIONE #2 What the fuck is going on, here? 
S.S. BRUGLIONE #2 Where's that spic barkeep? Yo, Pepe! Where you at?! 
As the gangsters achieve the cart, the brothers creep over the bar in the b.g. Brugliones look down on George, painted on his back... 
S.S. BRUGLIONE #3 "Erin go brah?" What the hell does that mean? Connor and Murphy are standing 25 feet behind them. 
MURPHY It's Irish for "You're fucked." 
Hard core music as the Brugliones turn in horror. Everyone begins firing and we have slow motion gunplay to pulsating music. 
Several are chewed up as chests explode and they are blown into George on the cart, knocking it over. George comes to. 
Romeo appears and tears in, sending several more crashing into the salad bar. 
Murphy, while firing, dives back over the bar as bottles explode. Connor rapid fires as he dives into a booth. 
The boys rise and lay out a second barrage, blasting the rest into buffet tables and a soda fountain. The music cuts. 
ROMEO Viva La Mejico, bitches! 
George bolts up.    The bus cart is still tied to his fat belly. 
GEORGE Uh, I've seen the light! You guys have really turned me around on this! I'm like born again and shit! I swear! 
MURPHY (to Connor) What do ya think? Let him go? 
Connor slips one bullet in a revolver, spins the barrel and snaps it shut. He points it to George's forehead. George weeps in earnest. 
She hands the INTERpol file to the brothers. 
CONNOR This is the guy? 
EUNICE That's the guy. He's a Sicilian immigrant, name of Ottilio Panza. 
MURPHY Five, five?    He's short bastard isn't he? 
EUNICE Yes...and well put. He'll be front page news in the morning but we have to assume Yakavetta already knows we've ID'd his guy. We can't give him time to 'Plan B' us. 
MURPHY We're hittin' him tomorrow night.   Dat soon enough? 
Everyone else cuts their conversation and listens. 
EUNICE Should be.   Where's it gonna happen? 
CONNOR The Pru. 
DOLLY The Prudential Building?   What are you, cracked? 
GREENLY Why don't you just do it on center ice at a fucking Bruin's game?! 
CONNOR Dat's where the man is so dat's where we're goin'. No guts no glory, Green Beans. 
MURPHY In fact, we could use a few extra hands...that is if you fellas can still get yer Irish on. 
GREENLY Hey, I got balls for days, pally.   I'm a fucking sack-o-matic. 
They all chuckle. 
DOLLY AND DUFFY We're in. 
EUNICE (to all) Well, you boys have fun. Connor, Murphy? Escort a lady to the door? 
They each offer an arm and move her toward the door. 
CONNOR Y'sure you don't wanna hear the plan? I'm not tryin' ta brag or nothin' but this one's a real Picasso. 
MURPHY Aw, Jesus. 
CONNOR Hey. 
EUNICE School night. Got some homework to do. Besides, I'd like to critique your masterpiece with a fresh eye. 
She stops at the door and turns.    Her face shows concern. 
MURPHY What is it? 
EUNICE Something ain't right with this whole thing. Panza knew you were in there tonight and he just let it happen. Didn't lift a finger. I mean, if he's working for Yakavetta, why would he stand by and just watch all his guys get taken out? 
MURPHY That is...interestin'. 
CONNOR You think maybe we got another fox in the hen house here? 
EUNICE Starting ta look that way. Somebody pushed that visa through. Could have ourselves a gen-u-ine 'Ghost in the Darkness,' here. 
INT. GREENHOUSE -- LATER 
Crew Cut lies on the shop table. He's lost a lot of blood and is in shock. Using gardening utensils, the Old Man removes the bullet. We see his face for the first time. Unremarkable. In Italian... 
CREW CUT They still live...What if he does not come? What if... 
OLD MAN Shhhhh.   He will come. 
INT. BASEMENT -- NIGHT 
The Irish GUN DEALER (30's) from the first film leads the brothers and Romeo through a basement to a large, steel vault door. 
GUN DEALER Expanded my operation, since I saw ya last. Word got out who may or may not have outfitted ya. Turns out ya got quite the underground followin'. 
He swings the vault open. Romeo and the boys stand in angelic light at the gates of Heaven. Cheesy music as they enter... 
INT. VAULT -- CONTINUOUS 
Expanded indeed. Gleaming weapons everywhere. Sheer awe. Something catches Romeo's eye and he moves off. To boys... 
GUN DEALER Please, gentlemen. Preferred customers select from my private reserve. 
He withdraws two Mahogany boxes. 
GUN DEALER (CONT'D) If I may make a suggestion. 
He lifts the lids. In each box is a pair of Desert Eagle .50 cal "Black Outs". The triangular barrels have been fitted with matching triangular silencers. The boys are mystified. 
MURPHY I feel like that kid who found the gold ticket in the candy bar in "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory." 
EXT. THE PRUDENTIAL BUILDING -- NIGHT 
Dolly drives a laundry truck into the Pru's loading dock area. 
INT. LAUNDRY TRUCK -- NIGHT 
Dolly backs it up to the dock and pulls to a stop.   He turns. 
DOLLY God speed. Romeo, in a laundry uniform, emerges from the back pushing a loaded laundry cart. He enters a... 
INT. UTILITY HALL -- MOMENTS LATER 
At the hall's opposing end, two maintenance workers move toward. Romeo sees and quickly puts his head down. Soon, Romeo and the maintenance men converge. They turn, entering opposing elevators. 
INT. ROMEO'S ELEVATOR -- CONTINUOUS 
As the doors close, Romeo looks into the opposing elevator. The maintenance men are Duffy and Greenly, ball caps, duffel bags. 
As the elevator ascends, Romeo swipes off the laundry, pulls the false top. The brothers pop out in their usual garb. Weapons emerge and they gear up. Romeo looks unsure... 
MURPHY What. 
ROMEO Nothing. 
CONNOR Out with it! What the hell's the matter with ya? 
ROMEO Nothing! It's just...this is some heavy shit. 
CONNOR Ya did fine at your uncle's place. 
ROMEO Yeah, but we're going off a new script here. I'm just having a...period of adjustment. 
MURPHY You're about to have a period of gettin' yer ass beat! 
ROMEO Hey! You two ain't the only ones rollin' with no health insurance! Just let me do my thing. I'm absorbing this. 
CONNOR This is not the time for you to be absorbin' shit! Now, if ya freeze up when you get in there just point yer gay guns at 'em and fer Christ sakes, at least try ta look cool! 
MURPHY I thought you were all hot fer dis! 
ROMEO Oh, I'm hot! I'm fucking red hot! The kid's flamin' like Matt Damon in the Grande Camens! 
Ding!   Romeo has a look of dread. 
CONNOR This is you. Be on time. 
Romeo firms himself up as the door opens. 
ROMEO I'll be there. 
Romeo exits with the cart. The boys remain.    The doors close. Connor and Murphy look at each other. 
CONNOR You ready fer dis shit, my dear brother? 
MURPHY (cocking .50 cal) Let's do some gratuitous violence. 
FLASH TO WHITE... 
INT. LUXURY APARTMENT -- NIGHT 
A demolished environment. The towering windows are blown out, providing a threatening view of the city below. Here, Eunice stands, looking out over the panorama. 
EUNICE (to herself) On a sultry Saturday in September the Saints saved seventeen souls...try saying that five times fast. 
She turns and walks the marble floor which is like a runway, lined with pulverized statues. A long table of ravaged food extends. Crime scene personnel toil. Ritualized bodies everywhere.   Greenly is by the panic room. He pushes the "talk" button. 
GREENLY Come on. There's nothing to be afraid of. It's all over. 
(TURNS) He won't come out. 
He joins Dolly and Duffy who stand on the periphery. Eunice is dead center, absorbing the scene when suddenly, FBI Agent JOHN KUNTSLER barrels in with his G-MEN #1 - #3. 
KUNTSLER Special Agent Bloom! You are hereby relieved of all obligation to this investigation. 
He holds up his I.D.   A collective groan from crime scene personnel. 
KUNTSLER (CONT'D) That's right, kids. This crime scene is now under the full jurisdiction of your beloved federal government. As of now, you will all report to me, Special Agent John Kuntsler. 
The detectives look to Kuntsler's G-men as if squaring off. 
KUNTSLER (CONT'D) Don't let us interrupt you. Just don't forget to turn over everything you find. We have people standing by ready to take credit for all your hard work. 
He chuckles as all return to work.   Kuntsler turns to Eunice. 
KUNTSLER (CONT'D) So, how ya doin', Bloomy? 
Duffy, Greenly and the boys descend the tower. Greenly works the controls as Duffy helps the boys tie on harnesses. 
MURPHY It's ridiculous! Probably based on some stupid shit ya saw in a movie! And here I am AGAIN all tyin' myself up with rope! What is the deal with you and rope?! Honestly! 
CONNOR It happens ta be a useful thing! 
The boys start yelling over each other.   Duffy turns to Connor. 
DUFFY You didn't get this from a movie...did you? 
Murphy regards his brother, "well?"   Pause. 
CONNOR The "Eiger Sanction," Clint Eastwood! And it worked like a fucking charm for him! 
INT. JANITOR CLOSET -- SAME TIME 
Romeo peeks out a cracked door at a Mafioso guard. LLOYD (33yrs), a janitor, gagged and duct taped to a hand truck. He has a shiner. Romeo looks through his wallet. 
ROMEO O'kay Lloyd Cranston of 135 Liberty Lane, apartment 3C. (shows him wallet pic) Lovely wife and kids. How old are they? Nevermind. Here's the situation, Lloyd. Me and a couple of friends of mine are fittin' to do some killin' here tonight. I'm talking bullets and blood, custom-wholesale slaughter. You following me, Lloyd-O? (Lloyd nods) Good. Now, I've run into a little snag. I need to figure out a tag line. You know, something cool to say when it's all over like..."I'll be back," but mine, y'know? I need to own this one. I think this'll help me get through the quote, unquote event. I'm going to take your gag off and you and me are going to riff a little, o'kay? Let's have fun with this. 
Lloyd nods and Romeo rips off his gag. 
LLOYD I can't believe you! I'm a fucking janitor. What do I know about bullets and slaughter and shit? 
ROMEO Not riffing, Lloyd! Now, I need an "Hasta La Vista" line, toute fucking suite and you're gonna help me think of one! 
EXT. SCAFFOLD -- LATER 
Eunice stands alone on the end of the scaffold. 
EUNICE And you can count on it like the U.S. mail. Through rain, sleet, hail or snow...something always seems to go wrong for these poor sons o' guns. 
The scaffold suddenly stops. 
CONNOR What the fuck? 
GREENLY (hitting controls) I don't know! It just stopped! 
MURPHY Well, get it fuckin' goin' again! 
GREENLY It won't turn back on!     It just died! 
BROTHERS 
OH, SHIT! 
The boys look over the edge.     Long way down. 
CONNOR How much time?! 
DUFFY (looks at watch) Sixty Seconds! 
MURPHY We gotta go now! 
DUFFY What are you talking about!? 
CONNOR If we're even a few seconds late, Romeo's dead! We gotta go! (looking up) We're down thirteen stories! 
MURPHY Eleven more to go!     Ball park it! 
They start counting out lengths of rope by feeding them through their hands and extending their arms out to the sides. 
BROTHERS One floor, two, three... 
MURPHY 
(MIFFED) The fuckin' Eiger Sanction. 
INT. JANITOR CLOSET -- SAME TIME 
Lloyd struggles to think. 
LLOYD Uh..."Take that, suckers!" 
ROMEO Not cool enough. 
LLOYD Uh, "Merry Christmas, mother fuckers!" 
ROMEO Too sacrilegious. 
LLOYD Oh God, uh, how about "Eat it!" 
ROMEO What are we at, a buffet, now? 
LLOYD Good God, man! I'm a... 
SLO-MO: Gangsters are torn up as they are blown over furniture, into walls. Romeo blasts. Slow motion gun battle. 
SLO-MO: Yakavetta runs toward his panic room. At the last second, Jimmy the Gofer hip-checks him and dives in. The door slides shut. 
For a few moments the gun battle rages around Eunice who stands in the center rapid firing at the gangsters. 
EUNICE 
YEEEEEEE HAAAAAAAW!!! 
Soon it is over. The brothers slam Concezio to his knees and level to the back of his head. As he begs for his life... 
BOTH And shepherds we shall be, for Thee, my Lord, for Thee. Power hath descended forth from Thy hand, that our feet may swiftly carry out Thy command. 
(MORE) 
BOTH (CONT'D) So, we shall flow a river forth to Thee and teeming with souls shall it ever be. 
Romeo watches in awe. 
BOTH (CONT'D) In Nomine Patris, e Filii, e Spiritus Sancti. 
Boom.   Concezio drops.   Romeo's been waiting, guns up and... 
ROMEO "Who ordered the whup ass fajita!?" 
MURPHY What? 
CONNOR Whup ass fajita? 
The brothers turn to each other. 
CONNOR AND MURPHY That's fuckin' stupid. 
Eunice whistles in sympathy as she lifts her brim with a Colt. 
EUNICE Hold up, now. 
Everything freezes in place.     Eunice shuffles over to Romeo. 
EUNICE (CONT'D) Was that the best you could do? 
ROMEO It's just...I couldn't think...I 
EUNICE Shhhhhh. (whispers in ear) Ya broke down the door, didn'tcha? 
Romeo snaps his head toward the entry with inspiration in his eyes. QUICK CUT: He breaks down the door. QUICK CUT: The brothers shoot Yakavetta. QUICK CUT: Romeo, guns up and once more with feeling... 
ROMEO Ding dong, motherfucker, diiiing dong! 
The brothers look at Romeo, then to each other. 
MURPHY Exactly. 
CONNOR You said it. 
WHIP PAN... 
INT. BACK TO PRESENT, LUXURY APARTMENT -- LATER 
Eunice stands before the panic room door.   She is totally disheveled. She swipes her hair back. 
EUNICE And that, gentlemen...is the sound of the fat lady singin'. 
Everyone stands in shock, Kuntsler, his G-men, the detectives even crime scene workers. Greenly whispers to Duffy... 
GREENLY Should we...clap or something? 
DUFFY Shut up. 
Suddenly, the panic room door slides open and Jimmy yanks Eunice inside. The door shuts. Everyone rushes toward. 
KUNTSLER Hey! 
Duffy bangs on the door. 
DUFFY Eunice!    Oh, shit!    Eunice! Greenly slams the talk button. 
GREENLY If you hurt her, you piece of shit, I will kill you! Do you fucking hear, me? I'll kill you! 
Greenly wheels around, facing Kuntsler. 
GREENLY (CONT'D) Get a hostage negotiator down here and put some stank on it! He could be in there all...touching her and shit! 
INT. PANIC ROOM -- CONTINUOUS 
CONNOR One in the hole. 
They see a shotgun behind the bar. Murphy grabs it.   Just as they are about to stand, they hear Doc cry out. 
DOC Boys! 
They stand and level. Crew Cut has Doc from behind, .9mm to his temple. Thick accent... 
CREW CUT Put dem down! Throw dem over! 
The boys do not flinch. Crew Cut pushes his gun into Doc's temple hard. He cries out in pain. 
CREW CUT (CONT'D) Throw dem over! 
The boys toss their guns over the bar. Crew Cut levels toward them, holding Doc in place. He whispers in Doc's ear. 
CREW CUT (CONT'D) Brothers, eh? Which one first?      This one? (re: Murphy) Dee other, eh? 
He cocks back his hammer. A silence POP! rings out from the shadows. Crew Cut's hand is hit. He drops, crying out in pain. 
SLO-MO: Poppa M emerges from the shadows and moves to Crew Cut with a smoking, silenced Walther pistol in hand. 
The brothers have just a moment of shock before Greenly chokes up some blood. They jump the bar and rush to him. 
MURPHY Jesus Christ! 
CONNOR Doc!   Call da fuckin' ambulance! As they hold Greenly and beg him to hold on, we move to Poppa M standing over Crew Cut. Crew Cut looks up at him in awe. 
CREW CUT You. 
POPPA M Where is the Old Man? 
CREW CUT Never. 
Poppa M pulls two .38 revolvers. He snaps the rotary chambers out, puts one bullet in each gun, spins the chambers and snaps them shut. He holds them out to Crew Cut. The boys weep, oblivious to this. 
MURPHY Just hold on. 
CONNOR Hang in there, brother.     They're comin'. 
Greenly struggles to speak. 
GREENLY Naw, boys...it's over. Don't worry...proudest day of my life. 
He seizes violently and dies. The brothers are in anguish. Crew Cut picks a .38 and stands. He and Poppa M level to each other's foreheads. Crew Cut is excited. Poppa M is calm, tranquil. The brothers bolt up in shock. 
BROTHERS Da! 
POPPA M Easy, boys. 
The boys watch in horror, trying to figure it out. Poppa M motions for his opponent to go first. Crew Cut cocks his hammer back with a "click." The brother's eyes go wide. 
MURPHY What the fuck's he doin'? 
Crew Cut pulls the trigger, "click!" 
BROTHERS 
JESUS CHRIST! Connor rushes over and grabs up the shotgun. 
CONNOR I'm gonna blow this mother fucker's brains out, right now! 
He cocks it and levels to Crew Cut's head. 
POPPA M 
CONNOR! 
Connor stops.   Poppa M holds out his free hand.   Halt. 
POPPA M (CONT'D) Son...Daddy's workin'. 
Connor lowers the gun.    Poppa M pulls back the hammer, "click." 
POPPA M (CONT'D) Where is he? 
Crew Cut is unsure of himself. He thinks. Shakes his head.       The brothers focus on Poppa M's gun as he tenses on the trigger. 
CONNOR AND MURPHY 
(WHISPER) Come on. 
Crew Cut clenches up, bracing for impact. Poppa M pulls, "click." The brothers drop to their knees and pray hard. Crew Cut recovers. He smiles, pulls back the hammer. In Italian... 
CREW CUT Make me famous. 
MAFIOSO #1 What's da matter with you, eh? 
We see Louie peeking through the curtains. 
LOUIE 
(WHISPERING) Easy, Noah...easy friend. 
MAFIOSO #2 What are you, stupid or something? 
He smacks Noah across the face. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. WOODS -- NIGHT 
Noah and Louie bury the bodies of Mafioso #1 and #2.      Louie stops and rests. He watches Noah and thinks. 
INT. COBBLER SHOP -- DAY 
"CLOSED" sign in the door.   Noah and Louie eat sandwiches. 
POPPA M Then one day... 
LOUIE Why should we not help others who suffer these Mafia thugs? 
Noah puts down his sandwich. Louie talks to Noah with passion, m.o.s. and he listens while nodding his head. 
POPPA M V.O. Then it began. 
Over dialogue and music we see the following images... 
Noah cuts out a chalk sketch on a large sheet of shoe leather. 
Louie helps Noah make a "serious looking" leather vest. 
Louie hobbles in with a sack.   He dumps a bevy of handguns on a table. All different makes. 
POPPA M V.O. (CONT'D) Louie would pick the marks and plan everything in detail. 
Louie draws a map on a note pad and speaks m.o.s. 
Holsters and bullet belts are sewn into the vest. 
Noah loads the vest with guns as Louie tightens the buckles, stands back and looks Noah over. Ominous. 
POPPA M V.O. (CONT'D) And I would go in and do the jobs. 
A mob boss and two body guards wait for an elevator. The doors open. Insides is Noah, dark jacket, English Mac (hat). He opens his coat, revealing the vest. He draws two weapons, executes them all and calmly hits a button. The doors close. 
POPPA M V.O. (CONT'D) I would execute, over and over again, those who had taken my father from me. 
We do a montage of Noah killing Mafiosi in many different ways. 
POPPA M V.O. (CONT'D) So it went for years. 
EXT. BACK TO PRESENT, KITCHEN -- LATER 
We pan to the gaping mouthed brothers. 
MURPHY Jesus. 
CONNOR So...how'd ya end up inside, Da? 
POPPA M Back in '75, I did a hit, came out and the police were waitin' for me. He set me up, 25 to life. 
MURPHY Wait...why did he set you up? 
POPPA M Can't wait ta ask him. 
CONNOR Why didn't ya flip on him? Cut down yer time? The guy fucked ya. 
POPPA M I couldn't. 
CONNOR Why the hell not? 
INT. FLASHBACK, PRISON PHONE VISITING AREA -- NIGHT 
A picture of a woman with two babies is slammed to the glass. 
EXT. BACK TO PRESENT, KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER 
POPPA M He'd learned of the birth of my sons. 
Connor and Murphy hang their heads.      Connor looks up. 
KUNTSLER (CONT'D) Are those fucking news choppers?! 
INT. GREENHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER 
POPPA M Why the priest, Louie?     Why all this? Why, now? 
ROMAN Because I knew it would bring you and your sons. You would destroy the Yakavettas and clear my way. This time, I will take what is rightfully mine. Just a little piece, for my old age. After all, I have never been a greedy man. 
The Roman puts the needle back on the record.    Jazz plays. 
INT. PARLOR, UPSTAIRS -- SAME TIME 
THUG #6 That's it!   Move! 
Another Thug opens the bay windows.    Thundering music! 
INT. NEIGHBORING ROOM -- SAME TIME 
BIRD'S EYE VIEW: Looking down on Connor and Murphy.    They rapid fire their huge .50 cals through the wall. 
INT. PARLOR -- SAME TIME 
SLO-MO: The heavy rounds blast through the wall and massacre the three Thugs as they are about to exit. 
INT. BACK OF GREENHOUSE -- SAME TIME 
All following visuals in slo-mo with slamming music... 
Poppa "M" stands, throwing open his trench and revealing his leather vest, a six gun rig in the front. The Roman in awe. 
The double doors crash in and men barrel through as Poppa M turns, pulls two weapons and fires upon them, hitting one. 
The boys crash through the glass ceiling of the greenhouse on either side of Poppa M. They fire as they fall, hit the ground and roll. 
Romeo bursts into the fray from inside the house, blasting away with his gold .45's, a shotgun hanging on his back. 
The garden is being torn apart as the brothers, Poppa M and Romeo hit their marks and the hit squad returns fire. The boys dive behind fountains which are then pulverized. 
The gun battle rages around the Roman who remains seated in the very mouth of madness. His heart breaks as his sanctuary is shredded. 
Romeo fires as a large rack of wine behind him is torn apart. 
Murphy fires over a statue and bodies crash into the pool. 
Connor stands, firing in a Jesus Christ pose. 
Poppa M drops his empty weapons and pulls two more, laying down a second barrage. 
Romeo is simultaneously hit in the leg and shoulder. He falls, dropping his .45s. He struggles to fire the shotgun. 
Poppa M takes one in the chest. 
Connor is wounded in the shoulder but continues firing. 
Murphy is hit in the leg but continues firing. The boys and Romeo manage to take out the last of the Thugs, who are blasted into the Turkish pool. It is over. The music fades... 
EXT. FRONT OF HOME -- MOMENTS LATER 
Squad cars screech to a halt as the chopper lands behind them. Kuntsler exits, shouting orders. Many officers level over their hoods as S.W.A.T. piles out and moves toward. 
INT. GREENHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER 
The Roman looks around, tears in his eyes.   The boys hobble to their failing father who is on his knees. 
CONNOR AND MURPHY Da? 
POPPA M Boys.    Help me up. 
They get him to his feet. Poppa M turns to the Roman. He levels a revolver toward the seated man. With his last bit of strength... 
POPPA M (CONT'D) I'll see you in a minute, Louie. 
Poppa M fires one right between the Roman's eyes.    Poppa M crumbles. His sons lay him down. 
CONNOR Oh, no, no, no. 
Poppa M smiles as he looks up at the sun through the blown out glass ceiling. A plume of butterflies escape. 
POPPA M It's a beautiful day. 
MURPHY Aye.    It is...it is, Da. 
He dies. The brothers weep. Nearby, Romeo is slumped and bleeding, on the edge of consciousness. A strange calm comes over the brothers as they stand and look to one another. 
S.W.A.T. can be heard surrounding the perimeter. The boys look to Romeo. He smiles at them and nods. The brothers turn and walk into the house. The echoed voice of Poppa M.

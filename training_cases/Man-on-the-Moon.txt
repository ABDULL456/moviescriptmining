Man on the Moon 
Man on the Moon (1999) by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski. 
FADE IN: 
INT. VOID - DAY 
Standing in a nonexistent set is ANDY KAUFMAN, looking a bit nervous.  Wide-eyed, tentative, he stares at us with a needy, unsettling cuteness.  His hair is slicked-down, and he wears the "FRIENDLY WORLD" costume from the Andy Kaufman special. 
Finally, Andy speaks -- in a peculiar FOREIGN ACCENT. 
ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN) Hallo.  I am Andy.  Welcoom to my movie. (beat; he gets upset) I hoped the story of my life would be nice...but it turned out terrible!  It is all LIES!  Tings are mixed up... real people I knew play different people.  WHAT A MESS! So I broke into Universal and cut out the junk.  Now it's much shorter.  In fact, this is the end of the movie.  So tanks for comink! Bye-bye! 
Andy puts a needle on a phonograph, and swelling CLOSING CREDITS MUSIC starts to play.  FINAL CREDITS roll. 
Andy stands frozen, awkwardly looking at the audience. Every time the music ends he picks up the needle and restarts the music.  He does that as many times as the credits require. 
Finally, CREDITS END.  And then--a sly smile.  He leans in. DROPS HIS ACCENT and WHISPERS. 
ANDY (AS REGULAR VOICE) Okay!  Just my friends are left.  I wanted to get rid of those other people... they would have laughed in the wrong places. (beat) I was only kidding about the movie... it's actually PRETTY GOOD! It shows everything... from me as a little boy until my death -- (his eyes pop; he covers his mouth) Oops!!  I wasn't supposed to talk about that!  Oh.  Eh, uh, we better just begin.  It starts back in Great Neck, Long Island... 
Andy turns to a primitive 16mm PROJECTOR and turns it on. WHIR!  He smiles at the flickering light. 
ANDY Oh, yes.  I remember it well... 
We PUSH INTO the white light.  It fills our frame, blazing whiter, whiter... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. KAUFMAN HOUSE - 1957 - DAY 
A BLACK AND WHITE image slowly becomes COLOR.  Great Neck, 1957.  An upper-class Jewish neighborhood.  In the street, crewcut BOYS play t-ball, laughing and shouting.  A fat convertible pulls up to the smallest house, and STANLEY KAUFMAN, 40, gets out.  Still in his suit, he's a well- meaning slave to his job -- tired, responsible. 
Stanley goes over to admire the t-ball game.  At bat is his son MICHAEL, 6, a natural charmer.  Michael swings -- crack! -- and hits a solid single.  Stanley smiles. 
STANLEY That's my boy!  Good swingin', kiddo. (warm beat; then a look) Hey -- Michael... where's your brother? 
MICHAEL He's inside. 
Instantly -- Stanley's mood turns black.  He frowns angrily, then snatches his briefcase and marches in. 
INT. KAUFMAN HOUSE, KITCHEN - 1957 - DAY 
Baby CAROL is crying.  Mom JANICE, 35, quickly peels carrots, trying to get dinner made.  Stanley marches past. 
STANLEY Is he in his room? 
JANICE Of course he's in his room. (aggravated) All his "friends" are in there. 
Stanley glowers.  He huffs upstairs. 
INT. KAUFMAN HOUSE, HALLWAY - 1957 - DAY 
Stanley hurries up to Andy's shut door.  We hear little Andy doing VOICES. 
ANDY (O.S.) (as WORRIED GIRL) But professor, why are the monsters growing so big? (now as BRITISH PROFESSOR) It's something in the jungle water. I need to crack the secret code. 
Stanley rolls his eyes.  He opens the door... 
INT. KAUFMAN HOUSE, ANDY'S ROOM - 1957 - DAY 
...revealing ANDY, 8, performing for the wall.  Andy is happy and enthusiastic... as long as he's acting. 
ANDY (as BRITISH PROFESSOR) Maybe I should talk to the natives. (as dancing NATIVES) Shoom boom boo ba!  Shoom boom boo ba -- 
STANLEY Andy! 
ANDY (startled) Oh! 
The boy suddenly turns off, becoming introverted... awkward. Frustrated, Stanley stares at his son. 
STANLEY Andy, this has to stop.  Our house isn't a television station.  There is not a camera in that wall. 
Andy glances over at the wall.  Hmm. 
STANLEY (cont'd) (trying to cope) Son... listen to me.  It isn't healthy.  You should be outside, playing sports. 
ANDY But I've got a sports show. Championship wrestling, at five. 
STANLEY (he blows his top) You know that's not what I meant! Look, I'm gonna put my foot down! No more playing alone.  You wanna perform, you GOTTA have an audience! 
ANDY (he points at the wall) B-but I have them. 
STANLEY No!  That is NOT an audience!  That is PLASTER!  An audience is people made of flesh!  They -- live and breathe!  Got it?! 
Andy thinks, considering his options.  Then, he nods. CUT TO: 
INT. KAUFMAN HOUSE, FAMILY ROOM - 1957 - LATER THAT DAY 
Baby Carol sits in her crib.  Andy's hands suddenly YANK her out. 
INT. KAUFMAN HOUSE, ANDY'S ROOM - 1957 - DAY 
Andy hurries in and plops Carol down on the floor.  She dutifully sits there, deadpan. 
Andy returns to the center of the room.  He resumes his show. 
ANDY (as KIDDIE SHOW HOST) And now, boys and girls!  It's time for... TV Fun House! (he makes an APPLAUSE SOUND) Hi, everybody!  Are you ready for a singalong?  I'll say the animal, and you make his sound!  Okay...?  Okay! (he starts to SING) "Oh, the cow goes........." 
The thugs are dismayed. 
THUG #1 Goddamn immigrants! 
THUG #2 This guy's pathetic.  Let's go. 
Harsh glances.  They angrily turn and leave. 
Andy takes a nervous breath, then starts picking his things off the street.  He shouts after the guys: 
ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN) Tank you veddy much...! 
CUT TO: 
EXT. NY IMPROV - 1975 - NIGHT 
The Improv, the biggest comedy club around.  People are lined up, waiting.  The man strides up -- GEORGE SHAPIRO, a Hollywood talent manager.  George is old school: Bronx accent, shmooze and a hug... but with a surprising sweetness that is quite disarming.  A DOORMAN sees him, grins, and waves George in. 
INT. NY IMPROV, BAR - 1975 - NIGHT 
The bar is packed with COMICS and SHOW BIZ TYPES.  A few turn and smile -- "George!"  "Hey, George!"  George takes a couple hands, whispers to someone else, then drifts into the... 
INT. NY IMPROV, SHOWROOM - 1975 - NIGHT 
Where the show's in progress.  Owner BUDD FRIEDMAN sees George and gives him a bear-hug.  Then he hustles George to a table. 
George sits -- and gives the stage his undivided attention. Up there is a WISEASS COMIC. 
WISEASS COMIC So I'm getting my mother-in-law a special Christmas present: A pre- paid funeral!  The mortician asked me if I wanted her buried, embalmed or cremated.  I said, "Make it all three!  I'm not takin' any chances!" (the crowd LAUGHS) Thank you.  Good night! The comic waves and exits.  APPLAUSE.  George politely claps.  A PIANO PLAYER jumps in with an upbeat show tune. 
We think there's a break... when Andy suddenly, awkwardly steps on stage.  He is in character as Foreign Man.  Pink jacket, tie, hair slicked back, frightened like a deer in headlights.  He puts down his big case, pulls out various junk, and arranges it on chairs. 
The room hushes, uncertain as to who the hell this guy is. Andy tentatively grabs the mike.  The stagefright is agony. 
ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN) Now?  Now...? (looking around) Tank you veddy much.  I am very happy to be here.  I tink -- this is a very beautiful place.  But one ting I do not like is too much traffic.  Tonight I had to come from, eh, and the freeway, it was so much traffic.  It took me an hour and a half to get here! 
Andy chuckles, as if this were a punchline. 
Silence.  The crowd is baffled. 
ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN) (cont'd) But -- talking about the terrible things: My wife.  Take my wife, please take her. 
Yikes.  A few NERVOUS LAUGHS. 
Andy gestures, as if they got the joke. 
ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN) (cont'd) No really, I am only foolink.  I love my wife very much.  But she don't know how to cook.  You know, one time, she make a steak and mashed potato.  Ehh, and the night before, she make spaghetti and meatballs.  Her cooking is so bad... is terrible. 
People are embarrassed.  Some avert their eyes.  A couple hipsters laugh mockingly. 
George leans forward.  Andy wipes the sweat from his brow. ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN) (cont'd) Right now, I would like to do for you some imitations.  So first, I would like to imitate Archie Bunker. (no change in his voice) "You stupid, everybody ees stupid! Ehh, get, get out of my chair Meathead... go in the, eh, Dingbat get into the kitchen, making the food!  Ehh, everybody ees stupid!  I don't like nobody, ees so stupid!" Tank you veddy much. (pleased, he proudly bows) Now I would like to imitate Jimmy Carter, the President of the United States. (no change in his voice) "Hello, I am Jimmy Carter, the President of the United States." 
Some people BOO and walk out.  A few giggle, getting into the groove. 
George is intrigued. 
ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN) (cont'd) And now... I would like to imitate the Elvis Presley. 
A woman LAUGHS caustically.  Andy grins stupidly, then turns his back to us.  He presses "Play" on a CASSETTE RECORDER... and the THEME FROM 2001 starts playing. 
House lights dim dramatically.  With a flourish, Andy pulls tape off his pants -- revealing rhinestones.  He removes his pink coat -- putting on a white jeweled jacket. 
He combs his hair. 
Then he brushes his hair. 
Then he combs his hair some more. 
Finally he picks up a guitar, strikes a pose -- and spins around. 
He is ELVIS.  CONFIDENT.  SEXY.  LIP CURL.  DEAD-ON PERFECT. 
The crowd is blown away. 
Vegas Elvis INTRO MUSIC suddenly blasts.  Andy/Elvis swaggers stage left and takes a bow.  Then he goes stage right and takes a bow.  Then he returns stage left for another bow. 
Music STOPS. 
ANDY (AS ELVIS) Thank you very much. 
Wow.  Flabbergasted, people APPLAUD.  This man is Elvis. 
Suddenly -- "JAILHOUSE ROCK" guitar kicks in. 
ANDY (AS ELVIS) (cont'd) (SINGING) "Warden threw a party In the county jail! Prison band was there And they BEGAN to WAIL!" 
ANGLE - GEORGE 
He is astonished.  George cannot quite figure out what's going on... but he wants in. 
He waves Budd over.  Budd leans down, and George WHISPERS. 
GEORGE Pst.  What's the story with this guy? 
BUDD I think he's Lithuanian.  None of us can understand him. 
George nods admiringly. 
GEORGE He does a hell of an Elvis. 
SECRETARY (O.S.) He says he's an associate of Andy Kaufman's. 
GEORGE Oh. (back to the phone) Sammy, think about it.  I gotta go. (he punches a line) Hello?  George Shapiro here. 
On the phone, a STACCATO, ABRASIVE NASAL VOICE blares. 
TONY CLIFTON (V.O.) Uh, yeah.  Is this GEORGE SHAPIRO? 
GEORGE (beat) Er, yes.  Speaking. 
TONY CLIFTON (V.O.) "Speaking"!  Reeking, seeking, creaking... Freaking! 
George is baffled. 
GEORGE Can I help you with something? 
TONY CLIFTON (V.O.) Yeah!  You stay away from that Andy Kaufman, if you know what's good for you! 
GEORGE (stunned) Who is this? TONY CLIFTON (V.O.) You -- you know damn straight who it is.  Tony Clifton!  A name to respect.  A name to fear. (beat) Beer.  Gear.  Deer.  Ear. 
GEORGE Look... I don't know what your problem is... 
TONY CLIFTON (V.O.) Kaufman's a lying bastard!  If you sign him, I'll RUIN YOU! 
CLICK.  Clifton hangs up.  George is bewildered. 
INT. MEDITATION INSTITUTE UNIVERSITY, CLASSROOM - DAY 
The light is magical.  Soothing SITAR music plays.  Andy and fifteen other BAREFOOT STUDENTS sit on mats in a semi- circle.  Eyes shut, bodies in different yoga positions, they are all meditating. 
Facing them on a throne-like chair sits a reverent, Indian YOGI.  At his feet is the class teacher, LITTLE WENDY, a teeny lady with an absurdly high-pitched voice. 
LITTLE WENDY Now, while continuing your deep breathing, slowly open your eyes. You should feel rested, relaxed, and alert. 
The students all open their eyes. 
YOGI Do any thoughts come...? 
STUDENT #1 My mind is clear.  I feel great. 
YOGI Good... 
STUDENT #2 All the tension is gone from my body. 
The Yogi's eyes go to Andy.  Andy smiles sweetly. 
ANDY I want to thank you, your Holiness. My heart is radiating with pure energy. 
The Yogi nods kindly. 
YOGI You always had a good heart.  But I'm proud of the progress you've made in your discipline. ANDY Yes.  TM got me focused.  In fact, my manager got me a TV gig!  It's just some new show with no budget, but I'm still excited. 
Oh.  The Yogi peers intently. 
YOGI Are you at peace with your family? 
ANDY Um, yes.  I haven't fought with them, since I started here. 
YOGI Goals are important. 
ANDY I stopped drinking.  I gave up drugs.  And I'm meditating three hours a day.  It's the center of my life... 
YOGI We are all impressed. 
Andy smiles beatifically.  This means a lot. 
LITTLE WENDY Okay.  Anyone else --? 
ANDY Oh, wait!  I have a question. (beat; working up his nerve) Is there... is there a secret to being funny? 
Huh?  The Yogi thinks hard... squinching up his face. Then... he finally speaks. 
YOGI Yes.  Silence. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SNL SET - NIGHT 
An AUDIENCE sits, waiting for the commercial to end. TECHIES tweak lights.  CAMERAMEN get ready. 
Sitting in VIP seats are Andy's FAMILY.  Stanley and Janice are in their late 50's, Michael and Carol in their 20's. They're all anxious. 
CAROL I still can't believe my brother's gonna be on TV...! 
JANICE I hope he doesn't get nervous. STANLEY What's the difference?  This thing's on in the middle of the night -- no one's even gonna see it. 
The commercial ends, and the "APPLAUSE" sign blinks.  The crowd APPLAUDS.  An "ON THE AIR" sign lights up. 
HOST Welcome back to Saturday Night Live! And now, as a special treat on our first show... musical guest ANDY KAUFMAN!!! 
The SNL orchestra starts the intro into a song.  Andy enters the stage with a boom box, and positions himself in front of the microphone.  When the vocals are supposed to start, Andy doesn't open his mouth.  Instead he looks around -- frightened.  The band stops... and starts again.  Andy remains mute.  The Band stops again. 
INT. SNL SET, BOOTH - NIGHT 
The SNL producer, LORNE MICHAELS, looks worried. 
LORNE MICHAELS What's happening to him? 
INT. SNL SET - NIGHT 
Andy clicks his pen, done.  George smiles and takes the list.  He scans it... then his face gets totally befuddled. 
GEORGE Are you makin' fun of me --?  This is RIDICULOUS! 
ANDY (blasй) Those are my terms. 
GEORGE They're IMPOSSIBLE!!  Jesus! (he points at one item) I mean -- "two guaranteed guest shots for Tony Clifton"??!  Who is this TONY CLIFTON?! 
ANDY He's a Vegas entertainer.  I used to do impressions of him.  We sorta... got in a fight over that. 
George gets a look. 
GEORGE This Clifton called me up.  He's a loon!  He HATES you! ANDY Nah, he just talks tough.  But I owe him one. 
Andy smiles ingenuously, then turns stern. 
ANDY (cont'd) If I'm the new Fonz... ABC's just gonna have to give me what I want. (a sarcastic FONZIE IMPRESSION) Heyyyyyy! 
George winces.  He stares at the list. 
INT. ABC CONFERENCE ROOM - LA - DAY 
George sits across a conference table from three NETWORK SUITS.  He stoically reads the men his demands. 
GEORGE Mr. Kaufman will only appear in half the episodes. (beat) Mr. Kaufman requires an undisturbed 90 minutes of meditation prior to filming. (beat) Mr. Kaufman won't rehearse. (beat) Mr. Kaufman gets his own network Special. 
The execs are stupefied.  Finally -- George delivers the clincher. 
GEORGE (cont'd) And Taxi must guarantee two guest appearances to... Tony Clifton. 
NETWORK GUYS WHO??? 
GEORGE Tony Clifton. 
NETWORK GUY #1 Who is he?! 
GEORGE (solemn) I don't know. 
Long pause.  The execs stare at George like he's lost his mind. 
GEORGE (cont'd) But Andy says he's fabulous. (awkward) He also says, these are the terms. 
The execs' leader, MAYNARD SMITH, shudders hopelessly. 
NETWORK GUY #2 Couldn't Kaufman ask for more money, like everyone else? 
George slowly, sadly shakes his head:  No. 
Maynard glances at his team -- then frowns. 
MAYNARD (cont'd) George, we don't book phantom performers.  The deal's off. 
INT. SHAPIRO/WEST - DAY 
GEORGE throws his attachй case on the desk, then slumps into his chair.  He picks up the phone and dials. 
GEORGE Andy? 
ANDY (O.S.) Hi George! 
GEORGE Eh, hi, Andy.  Look, this Tony Clifton... is he performing anywhere? 
ANDY (O.S.) Of course. (beat) But only on Monday nights. 
GEORGE That's alright.  Where...? 
INT. MAMA ROMA'S - NIGHT 
Mama Roma's, a dark Italian restaurant with red booths, wise guys, and cigarette smoke. 
The Maitre'd guides George to a booth.  A small BAND fills the "stage" -- a six-foot space in the back of the room. 
The lights dim.  A BLARING ANNOUNCER speaks. 
ANNOUNCER (V.O.) And now, Mama Roma's is proud to present International Singing Sensation... a man who has sold more records than Elvis and the Beatles combined... 
George is skeptical. 
ANNOUNCER (V.O.) (cont'd) Ladies and Gentlemen, Mr. Entertainment... TONY CLIFTON! 
The DRUMMER starts a drum roll.  Patrons APPLAUD.  A LIGHT SPOT hits the entrance area... and nobody enters.  The spot is waiting... waiting... still waiting... until the drum roll slows down and stops.  The announcer BOOMS again. ANNOUNCER (V.O.) (cont'd) Ladies and Gentlemen, out of respect for Mr. Clifton's vocal demands, could everyone please extinguish your cigarettes and cigars. 
The crowd GRUMBLES angrily -- then irritably complies.  One ANGRY GUY thrusts his cigar into a water glass. 
ANGRY GUY Goddamn, I paid five dollars for this. 
ANNOUNCER (V.O.) And now!  A man who needs no introduction... TONY CLIFTON! 
The band starts playing lounge standard "VOLARE".  And then, obnoxious TONY CLIFTON swaggers out.  Tony has a rubbery face, black wig and moustache, sunglasses, a padded belly, and a peach tuxedo with blue shirt and velvet piping. 
Tony stops, smirks at the audience, and sucks on a cigarette.  He blows smoke rings at them. 
TONY CLIFTON Heh-heh.  How ya all doin'? 
The crowd is furious. 
ANGRY GUY Fuck you! 
People light back up and start talking.  Tony ignores the ruckus.  He starts SINGING, pinched and off-key. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ABC CONFERENCE ROOM - LA - DAY 
Maynard and the ABC suits sit at the table, mesmerized. George is confidentially whispering to them. 
GEORGE This has to stay in the room... but here's the thing: Andy is Tony.  And Tony is Andy!  They'll deny it up and down, but I swear to God, they're the same person! (with urgency) It's smart business!  You'll get two Andy Kaufmans for the price of one! 
Maynard thinks about this, quite methodically.  A beat, and then he cracks a smile... 
INT. ALPHA BETA SUPERMARKET - NIGHT 
1 a.m. in the supermarket.  Just a few people linger... including Andy, who's at the Space Invaders videogame.  Andy stares intently at the screen, eyes piercing, fingers hammering the buttons while he blows up Martians.  Andy is oblivious to all around him. 
In the b.g., George suddenly enters.  He looks around the market, then spots Andy.  He feverishly runs up. GEORGE Andy! 
ANDY (still playing the game) What's up? 
George grins crazily, ecstatically. 
GEORGE Andy... THEY SAID YES!  They agreed to it all!  They thought your terms were a shining example of your "irreverent wit" -- and precisely why they want you! (beat) You're getting EVERYTHING! 
Whoa.  Andy looks up, astonished.  His space station EXPLODES, but he doesn't notice.  He turns to George... and slowly smiles sweetly.  Genuinely. 
ANDY Well thank you very much...! 
CUT TO: 
INT. TAXI SET - DAY 
The first week of "TAXI."  The CAST rehearses on the Taxi set.  PRODUCERS watch from the bleachers. 
(The actual TAXI scene will be determined.)  JUDD HIRSCH, TONY DANZA, and MARILU HENNER read their lines. 
Then... a bored BLACK STAND-IN reads Latka's line. 
The cast glances around.  Tony Danza loses his temper. 
TONY DANZA Man, this is bullshit! (he marches up to the PRODUCER) Where's Kaufman?  Why isn't he here?? 
One producer stands.  This is tightly-wound ED WEINBERGER. 
ED You'll see him on Friday when we shoot.  Now run the lines with Rodney. 
An angry beat.  The actors resume... 
INT. TAXI SET - DAYS LATER 
The AUDIENCE is filtering in.  They fill the studio bleachers. 
INT. TAXI SET, BACKSTAGE - DAY 
Actors mingle outside the dressing rooms. 
JUDD HIRSCH I'm taking bets we do the show with the stand-in. 
MARILU HENNER No, I hear Andy arrived.  Rumor is he's locked inside his dressing room. 
Judd is surprised. 
INT. TAXI SET, ANDY'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY 
Andy is meditating.  He's tranquil, at total inner peace. 
Silence -- until a little clock radio CHIRPS. 
Andy snaps his eyes open.  He exhales a few calm breaths, then sits upright.  Andy reaches for a sealed envelope, rips it open, and removes a SCRIPT. 
Andy sighs, opens the script, and starts scanning the pages like a speedreader. 
INT. TAXI SET - LATER THAT DAY 
Bleachers are full.  They're now filming TAXI (the same scene as earlier).  On cue, Andy enters as LATKA -- wide- eyed, endearing, in mechanic's overalls. 
Andy is hilarious.  The crowd HOWLS with laughter. 
MONTAGE - TAXI 
In quick succession, a series of Andy's best Latka moments. He's beloved.  The applause grows louder, louder, LOUDER... 
INT. TAXI SET, BACKSTAGE - DAY 
TAXI curtain calls.  The whole cast takes bows, then runs offstage.  Everyone is grinning -- except Andy. 
He soberly strolls up to Zmuda. 
ANDY I'm gonna quit. 
ZMUDA What?!? 
ANDY Each show is worse than the next. 
ZMUDA Are you nuts?!  40 million people watch you every week! 
ANDY So?  What do they know? 
ZMUDA Absolutely nothing!  That's the beauty! (he lowers his voice) It's credibility.  You make them love you... and then later, on your special, you'll screw with their heads! 
Hmm?!  Andy raises an eyebrow. CUT TO: 
ANDY Do you wanna wrestle?  It's a good way of breaking the ice. (pause) That instant physical intimacy really brings two people together. 
Mimi is bewildered, and offended. 
MIMI What are you talking about?!  We just met an hour ago. 
ANDY (calm) No no no, it's not sex!  I mean -- it can lead to sex... but really, it's just wrestling. 
MIMI I don't wanna talk about it! 
An awkward silence.  They continue walking.  She points up. 
MIMI (cont'd) The sunset is really beautiful. 
ANDY What do you mean? 
MIMI (a bit offput) I mean -- uh -- the colors in the sky are so vibrant.  I love this time of day. 
ANDY (he shrugs dully) I've never understood that.  It's just... getting dark. (pause) But I like you!  Hey!  Why don't we fill the car with gas, drive to Tijuana, and GET MARRIED??? 
ANGLE - MIMI 
Fear.  She shivers, then hoarsely speaks. 
MIMI I think I wanna go home. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ABC CONFERENCE ROOM - LA - DAY 
George screens Andy's TV Special for Maynard and his team. The network execs look constipated. 
ON THE TV - Andy speaks tenderly, lovingly to Howdy Doody. ANDY (ON TV) You know... I was once in your gallery.  I was just sitting there and I wanted to touch you.  I was kind of depressed because I could see what everyone was like, and I was wondering if, now, maybe I could... touch you. 
Very gently, Andy touches Howdy's cheek and starts weeping. 
THE EXECS -- are horrified. 
ANDY (ON TV) (cont'd) Howdy, I've been watching you ever since I was a little boy... (choked up, nervous) You're the first friend from television I ever had.  I always wanted to meet you... and now ...I finally am. 
EXEC #2 This is NOT funny. 
EXEC #3 (ominous) "Artsy Fartsy shit"... 
GEORGE (worried at this response) No... eh, the Special isn't all like this... just wait... it will be hysterical. 
At that moment, the picture turns to FUZZY SNOW.  Maynard scowls. 
MAYNARD Christ!  We're the Number One Network -- can't we afford decent TVs?! 
Maynard angrily jumps and POUNDS on the TV.  BANG, BANG! George winces -- then mutters awkwardly. 
GEORGE No, um... it's part of the snow. 
An awful beat. 
Maynard is embarrassed.  Finally -- he explodes. 
MAYNARD Tell Kaufman we will NEVER air this program!! 
INT. JERRY'S DELI - NIGHT 
A delicatessen.  Andy wears an apron and angrily cleans tables.  He stacks dirty dishes and wipes up the food.  Two BLUE COLLAR GUYS gesture from a booth. 
BLUE COLLAR GUY 1 Excuse me, could I please have more coffee? 
ANDY Yeah, yeah, in a sec'. (he lugs the dishes to the kitchen) That was decaf, right? 
The guy nods.  Andy hurries over with the coffeepot and starts pouring. 
BLUE COLLAR GUY 1 You know, you look just like Andy Kaufman. 
ANDY Yeah, I get that all the time. 
Andy hurries off.  The guy's buddy leans in, whispering. 
BLUE COLLAR GUY 2 I'm telling you, it's him. 
BLUE COLLAR GUY 1 You wanna bet??  If that was him, he wouldn't be workin' here, pouring my coffee! 
NEAR THE KITCHEN 
Andy dumps out wet coffee grounds.  He is sweating.  In the b.g., George enters the restaurant.  He sees Andy, sits at a table and YELLS OUT. 
GEORGE Hey!  Could you clear this table and bring me a piece of poundcake? 
Andy turns.  They stare down each other. 
GEORGE (cont'd) Andy, this is ridiculous.  Take off that apron. 
ANDY (infuriated) NO!  I'd rather work here, than at ABC.  There's no lying in a restaurant.  They don't promise you a job as a cashier, then suddenly make you a frycook! 
Andy hurries off with a water pitcher.  George chases him. GEORGE Look, I'm sorry.  They're assholes! But we work in a creative business. You can't predict what people are gonna like -- 
ANDY The ONLY reason I did Taxi was so I could have my own Special! 
GEORGE (trying to calm him) Tell you what.  I'll book you on some concerts, and meanwhile, we'll show the Special around... see if somebody wants to buy it -- 
ANDY (bitter) Yeah, we can have a garage sale. "Hey look, I got a floor lamp and a network TV Special for only fifty cents!" 
He points at Tony, swaggering around on the set.  George shakes his head. 
GEORGE But that's Tony down there.  That's not Andy.  Trust me, it's like "Sybil" -- Andy's nowhere on the premises! 
Ed glares. 
ED Well whoever the fuck that is, I'm firing him! 
GEORGE (he sighs) Okay.  But we'll have to warn Andy first.  I think he's up in San Francisco, doing a concert. 
Heh?  Ed raises his eyebrows. 
CUT TO: 
INT. TAXI SET, TECH BOOTH - SECONDS LATER 
George is on the phone.  Ed hovers. 
GEORGE (INTO PHONE) Hi, Diane, this is George.  I'm trying to reach Andy up in San Francisco. (a stilted pause) Yeah, I'll wait. 
Ed glances down at the stage... and suddenly Tony is no longer there.  He's magically vanished. 
Beat. 
George turns on the SPEAKERPHONE, then CLICK!  Andy's happy voice pops on the line. 
ANDY (V.O.) Hi, George!  Good to hear from you! 
GEORGE Hi, Andy.  How's the weather up there? 
ANDY (V.O.) Oh, you know the Bay Area!  Always foggy! 
Ed looks totally off-balance.  George winks at him. 
GEORGE I'm here with Ed over at Taxi. There's been some trouble with Tony. 
ANDY (V.O.) Oh no!  Did he get hurt? 
ED No, no, Andy, nothing like that. (nervous beat) But... Tony's not fitting in.  His style of performance is too... burlesque. 
INTERCUT: 
INT. TAXI SET, ANDY'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY 
Tony is on the phone.  Little Wendy is busily refilling his whiskey bottle with canned ice tea.  He looks up, insulted. 
TONY CLIFTON (AS ANDY) "Burlesque"? 
BACK TO: 
INT. TAXI SET, TECH BOOTH - DAY 
ED Andy, I'm calling you up like this because I have the utmost respect for your artistry.  But -- I need your permission to fire him. 
ANDY (V.O.) Oh dear! (upset) George, this is gonna kill Tony. He's waited his whole life for this break. 
GEORGE There'll be other shots. 
ED Andy, I have to do it.  He's a terrible actor. 
Andy thinks about this. 
ANDY (V.O.) I guess I understand.  But Ed -- please... let him down gentle. 
ED Yes, Andy, I will. 
Andy hangs up.  A relieved Ed turns to George. 
ED (cont'd) Thank you. 
CUT TO: 
INT. TAXI SET - LATER THAT DAY 
Tony SCREAMS insanely. 
TONY CLIFTON FUCK YOU!  I AIN'T GOIN'!! 
WIDE 
Ed is stupefied.  The cast stands nervously behind him. 
ED We had a deal!! 
TONY CLIFTON I don't know what yer talkin' about. You musta talked to someone else -- 
ED Yeah!!  I talked to Andy Kaufman! 
TONY CLIFTON I don't know nothin' about no Kaufman.  He's been ridin' my coattails, smearing my reputation. Been usin' my good name, to get places. 
Ed is livid.  He gazes harshly at Tony -- Tony's burning eyes piercing through the rubber features. 
ED Get off my stage!  You're fired! 
TONY CLIFTON I GOT A CONTRACT!!  I'm gonna take you to the DEPARTMENT OF LABOR! 
Suddenly -- FLASH!  Ed looks over.  A REPORTER has a camera. 
ED Who're YOU?! 
ANDY Uh-huh!  See, with all these articles, people think they're insiders.  They see Tony Clifton, and they say, "Ah, that's really Andy Kaufman."  But that spoils it. So NOW, Tony denying being me is the truth!  Tony's not me!  But maybe he is!  The audience will never know... (giddy) They'll think they're laughin' at me -- but actually I'll be laughin' at them, because they're wrong and I'm right! 
George is dazed. 
GEORGE So you've got this big elaborate joke, which is really only funny to two people in the universe. (dry) You... and you. 
ZMUDA Sure!  But WE think it's kickass! Now I get to be Tony.  I get to dump the glass of water on someone else's head! 
GEORGE (he turns serious) But what's the POINT?  How will any of this make you the biggest star in the world? 
Hmm.  Andy contemplates this. 
ANDY George... I'm at a stage where the audience expects me to constantly shock them.  But short of faking my death, or setting the theater on fire, I don't know what else to do. (thoughtful) 'Cause I've always got to be one step ahead of them. 
GEORGE But I feel you're extending this philosophy to real life.  It's obsessive.  Nothing's ever on the level anymore. 
A perplexed beat. 
ANDY George, it never was. (pause) Didn't you know that? 
CUT TO: 
INT. ANDY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Arnold Schwarzenegger, in his glory days as a body-builder, on the cover of a magazine.  Magazines are everywhere.  Body- building.  Women's.  Wrestling. 
ANDY is sifting through them.  Zmuda watches, worried. 
ANDY Look at this!  An evil Russian! Ooo, here's an evil Nazi -- he likes to fight dirty!  Hey, here's an evil Japanese guy! 
ZMUDA What is this, World War Two...? 
ANDY You know, I always wanted to be a bad-guy wrestler... 
ZMUDA No offense, pal, but I just don't think you're built for it.  These he- men'll kick your ass!!  They're huge! 
Andy's face drops.  He realizes Zmuda's right. 
Beat -- then Andy notices an issue of Sumo Magazine, with a picture of a wrestler and his cute little fiancйe on the cover.  He slowly lifts it up, intrigued. 
ANDY Maybe I'll pick on someone smaller than me...! 
INT. MERV GRIFFIN SHOW - DAY 
CLOSE UP on Andy and Merv Griffin.  Andy wears a goofy wrestling outfit that resembles thermal underwear.  He is shouting like a wrestler. 
ANDY ... And I vow to continue wrestling until I am BEA TEN, in a three- minute match, with my shoulders pinned to the mat!! 
MERV (nonplussed) By a woman. 
ANDY Yes!  BY A WOMAN! (emphatic) I'm doing this because I feel that a woman cannot beat a man in wrestling.  Even if they train with weights... it requires a certain mental ability -- (a clumsy pause) And, uh -- I just don't feel they have that... 
The audience MURMURS uncomfortably.  Andy laughs and backpedals. 
ANDY (cont'd) No no!  Women are superior in many ways.  When it comes to cooking and cleaning, washing the potatoes, scrubbing the carrots, raising the babies, mopping the floors, they have it all over men.  I believe that! 
An appalled silence. 
Merv winces.  Some people start BOOING.  We can tell Andy is pleased. 
ANDY (cont'd) But when it comes to wrestling, forget it!  If there's a woman that can prove me wrong, come up here. I'll shut my mouth and pay her 500 dollars. 
Merv baitingly turns to the crowd. 
MERV Any... volunteers...? 
WIDE 
All the WOMEN'S hands angrily shoot up! 
We move through the crowd, finally picking out... a feisty woman, LYNNE.  She mutters, half hateful, half laughing -- 
LYNNE I wanna kill that jerk. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MERV GRIFFIN SHOW - MINUTES LATER 
Andy and Lynne stand in the ring.  She scornfully watches him preen about.  Zmuda is in a referee's uniform. 
ZMUDA (AS REFEREE) Will you please shake hands, go to your corners, and come out wrestling. 
Lynne extends her hand.  Andy fakes a shake -- then snidely refuses and struts away.  The crowd HISSES. 
DING!  It's the bell.  The match begins.  Lynne barrels at him, craving a victory, but terribly unprepared for this experience.  Andy immediately grabs her by the legs and flips her over. 
WHUMP!  She's down.  Andy has trained for this. 
Zmuda gets on his knees, watching, trying to look official. Lynne struggles and slithers away. 
She grabs Andy's arm and forces him down.  People CHEER. His torso hits the mat.  LOUDER CHEERS.  But suddenly he rolls over and pulls her hair!  Her head snaps back.  The crowd is INCENSED.  Zmuda hurries over and pantomimes a stern warning. 
Andy nods, and they separate.  They do a little dance around the ring, Lynne looking for a hole.  Suddenly, Andy spins her into a Half-Nelson.  Her arms are pinned.  They struggle, then he throws her down on her stomach.  One! Two!  Three! 
And DING!  It's OVER.  Andy jumps up and sneers at the crowd. 
ANDY I'm the winner!  I've got the BRAINS! (he points at his head) Now baby, don't fight nature!  Get back in the kitchen where you belong!!! 
Lynne glares. 
ANDY (he jokingly impersonates a drunk) I can shtop whenever I want... 
She's unamused. 
LYNNE Then stop treating me like a fucking prop. 
ANDY (he drops the act) I-I'm sorry.  I got caught up in the action...! 
She shoots him a stern look. 
LYNNE I'm warning you, Kaufman:  One morning you're gonna wake up... and your head's gonna be shaved. 
Andy laughs. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SHAPIRO/WEST - DAY 
George stares glumly at Andy.  Andy is quite cheerful -- eating a big piece of chocolate cake. 
GEORGE Andy, do you realize you don't do comedy anymore?  Where's that sweet guy who used to do (he SINGS Mighty Mouse) "Here I come to save the day!"? (long beat) Please, enough with the wrestling! You've lost touch with reality! 
ANDY (ingenuous) What, you don't think I can beat him? 
GEORGE He is the Southern Heavyweight Champion.  He'll kill you. (very disapproving) First, you piss-off women.  Then you piss-off the South.  Then you get killed! (dry) And I did the bookings. 
Andy shrugs, lacking a response.  He eats more cake. 
GEORGE (cont'd) Andy, look... there's a job I want you to take -- guest-hosting the TV show "Fridays."  It's not so hot... but this is a great opportunity for you.  The show's live, they'll give you carte blanche, and you can get back to the business of making people laugh. 
Andy gets a strange gleam.  He only heard one thing. 
ANDY You said -- live? 
INT. FRIDAYS SET, BACKSTAGE - DAY 
The FRIDAYS CAST prepares.  In a corner, ANDY is arguing with director JACK BURNS. 
ANDY I'm not comfortable with the last sketch.  I DON'T do drug humor! 
JACK BURNS Andy, it'll be fine!  It's what we're known for! (playing "stoned") "Maui?  "Wowie!" 
ANDY (losing his temper) You're not listening to me -- 
JACK BURNS Don't worry!  The kids will love it 
ANDY (he BLOWS up) But I don't do drugs!  And I don't enjoy making light of them! (YELLING) I was promised creative control! 
Andy storms off.  Eavesdropping cast shake their heads. 
ACTOR What a prick! 
INT. FRIDAYS SET, CONTROL BOOTH - DAY 
Up in the control booth is -- Maynard.  He smiles strangely. 
INT. KAUFMAN HOUSE, FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT 
Stanley sits in front of his TV.  The Fridays JINGLE and CREDITS come on.  We hear dishes being washed in the kitchen. 
STANLEY It's on!  JANICE, IT'S ON! 
Janice rushes in, still holding some dishes. 
(THE FOLLOWING IS INTERCUT: Between the studio and the show on tv at Andy's parents.) 
INT. FRIDAYS SET - NIGHT 
The show is going, live.  A SNIGGERING NARRATOR steps out front.  (During his monologue, the CAMERA PANS the audience.) 
NARRATOR In this next sketch, two married couples are out to dinner.  Now... everybody has secretly brought along a joint -- (crowd WHOOPS, he grins) So, when each person leaves the table, they sneak into the restroom to get a little high... 
The crowd CHEERS rowdily. 
CUT TO:

In the front row, Michael sits with a girl.  He whispers. 
MICHAEL Afterwards, I'll take you backstage. You can meet my brother. 
The girl smiles excitedly. 
The SKETCH is on a French restaurant set.  ANDY sits at a table with actor RICHARDS and actress MELANIE.  Another actress, MARY, tiptoes back over, GIGGLING stupidly, playing stoned. 
MARY "Gee, restaurants are amazing, aren't they?  All these strangers sitting around... stuffing dead animals in their faces!  It's just incredible!" 
She GIGGLES more.  The other three play baffled. 
INT. FRIDAYS SET, CONTROL BOOTH - NIGHT 
The tech crew is freaking out.  Maynard is oddly calm. 
TECH DIRECTOR Go to three!  Eh, go to four! 
CUT TO: 
INT. KAUFMAN HOUSE, FAMILY ROOM - SAME TIME 
Stanley and Janice are flabbergasted.  Jaws wide. 
On their TV - fists are flying.  Suddenly, the BAND kicks in and the show abruptly cuts to COMMERCIAL. 
They stare at the TV.  Until -- 
STANLEY I shoulda made him play outdoors. 
INT. FRIDAYS SET - NIGHT 
Andy and Jack are socking each other.  A FLOOR DIRECTOR screams at the top of his lungs. 
FLOOR DIRECTOR We've gone to commercial!  I said, WE'VE GONE TO COMMERCIAL!! 
Andy turns.  He notices the red lights are off -- and... instantly stops fighting.  Just like that.  Jack instantly stops too.  They glance at each other -- hold a beat -- then break into GUFFAWS.  They laugh and joyously kid each other. 
In the audience, Michael is STUNNED. 
MELANIE Oh my God --! 
All the commotion stops.  The audience doesn't know whether to laugh or boo.  The actors are flabbergasted -- then furious. 
MELANIE (cont'd) He's a fuckin' psycho! 
MARY Why didn't someone tell us??? 
Suddenly Maynard runs out of the booth, beaming.  People watch curiously. 
Andy seems discombobulated.  Maynard shouts out to EVERYBODY assembled. 
MAYNARD Excuse me!... I have an announcement to make!  You've all just participated in a "happening."  To make it real, some of you knew, and some of you didn't. 
The audience LAUGHS and APPLAUDS wildly.  The actors stare in disbelief.  One laughs hysterically.  Most are pissed. 
MAYNARD (cont'd) But we don't want to upset the folks at home.  So now Andy is now going to apologize and explain that it was all a prank.  Right, Andy? 
ANDY (very quiet) Right... 
MAYNARD Okay, great!  So let's reset! 
Crew members start moving things around. 
In the audience, Michael locks eyes with Andy.  An odd, knowing moment between the brothers.  Michael whispers, getting worried. 
MICHAEL Andy...! 
CUT TO: 
INT. KAUFMAN HOUSE, FAMILY ROOM - SAME TIME 
Stanley and Janice feel as if the commercials are lasting forever. 
JANICE Why is Andy doing this?  Why?... Why? 
The Fridays JINGLE starts, and Andy's face fades in on the TV.  He looks directly into the camera, nervous, stiff and serious. 
ANDY (ON TV) During the commercial, the people at ABC asked me to apologize... and to tell you the truth.  They wanted me to explain that this whole fighting episode was staged... 
INT. FRIDAYS SET - NIGHT 
The sign above blinks "APPLAUSE".  The audience obediently APPLAUDS.  In the booth, Maynard grins. 
ANDY And... um... (choking up) I can't do this. (beat) I-I can't say it. (upset) It's a lie!  A cover-up! 
Maynard is suddenly very confused.  The crowd laughs nervously. 
ANDY (cont'd) Why are you laughing?  I'm not trying to be funny!  They threatened to fire me from Taxi, unless I gave in to their demands! (shaken) But... I won't!  Because what you saw was REAL!! 
INT. FRIDAYS SET, CONTROL BOOTH - NIGHT 
Maynard looks like he's gonna faint. 
MAYNARD Cue the commercial! 
ANDY (ON TV) These kinds of things go on everyday at the networks, only you never see it, because they cut to commercials. (he talks extremely fast, to get in as much information before he's cut off) Now for sure they're gonna fire me, so if you want to see me again, you'll have to come to Memphis... 
And BLINK!  Andy gets CUT OFF. 
Maynard jumps up, furious.  He snaps. 
MAYNARD I'm gonna STRANGLE George Shapiro! 
INT. KAUFMAN HOUSE, FAMILY ROOM - SAME TIME 
The parents stare at the commercials.  They're totally disoriented. 
JANICE What's in Memphis? 
STANLEY Who knows?!  That kid is totally meshuga. 
ANNOUNCER (V.O.) It's a side suplex!! 
Andy lies on the mat, unmoving.  Lawler doesn't care.  He picks up Andy's prone body and grips it upside-down.  Janice covers her eyes.  Stanley is worried. 
REFEREE (frantically gesturing) NO!  NO! 
Lawler disregards the Ref and slams Andy's head in a pile- driver!! 
A horrible THUD. 
DING!  The BELL immediately RINGS. 
JANICE opens her eyes and SCREAMS. 
JANICE JESUS CHRIST!!!!! 
STANLEY Why isn't he MOVING?? 
Andy's parents' reaction is a fiesta for photographers. 
ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Lawler has committed a PILEDRIVER, which is an AUTOMATIC DISQUALIFICATION!  Match goes to Kaufman by disqualification, after two minutes, twelve seconds! Andy is splayed unconscious. 
Raging Lawler promenades around the ring, arms over his head.  The crowd SHOUTS CRAZILY, rooting him on. 
Lynne runs to the ropes, SCREAMING for help. 
LYNNE ANDY!!! (frantic) Somebody get a DOCTOR! 
ZMUDA (yelling) WE NEED A STRETCHER!! 
Stanley, totally numbed, holds Janice.  They're on the verge of collapsing.  Tons of commotion.  Cameras FLASH BLINDINGLY.  A stretcher is lifted into the ring.  Andy is loaded on.  MUSIC fights the deafening NOISE. 
BEDLAM.  Andy is carried through the crowd, followed by his entourage.  A soft object HITS Stanley on the head. 
INT. MID-SOUTH COLISEUM, CORRIDOR - NIGHT 
Andy is being carried by the Coliseum EMPLOYEES into the dressing room.  The entourage follows.  Zmuda pushes out the crowd of REPORTERS, PHOTOGRAPHERS, and ONLOOKERS.  He slams the door and locks it.

Janice runs to Andy's side.  She's crying. 
JANICE Andy!!  Are you okay?!? 
Andy opens his eyes. 
ANDY I'm fine, Mom, you can calm down. 
A confused beat. 
STANLEY B-but... we saw... your neck... 
ANDY Nah, it's phony baloney -- I faked the whole thing. (beat) It didn't hurt at all.  It was just a yoga move.  I tucked my head in. 
Deadpan, Andy sits up. 
Total silence.  Stanley stares... then a FURY comes over him. 
STANLEY Andrew -- HOW DARE YOU!!  For all we knew, you were DYING!  Look at your mother -- she's still shaking!

LAWLER You're a wimp. 
ANDY (upset) My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --! 
LAWLER Then your father's a wimp. 
ANDY (losing it) And you're just poor white trash! 
Lawler's had enough.  Enraged, he wildly stands and SLAPS Andy. 
BAM! 
Andy crashes over and falls from his chair. 
THUD.  He's on the floor. 
Dead silence.  Everyone is astonished. 
They're all slack-jawed.  Even PAUL SHAFFER.  Trying to cover, Paul hurriedly kicks in with a ROCKABILLY TUNE. 
Andy jumps up, crazed. 
ANDY (cont'd) I'M SICK AND TIRED OF THIS SHIT! 
Lawler freezes in his seat.  Letterman hides behind his desk. 
Andy storms over, out-of-control.  From a safe distance, he starts SCREAMING at Lawler. 
ANDY (cont'd) YOU ARE FULL OF SHIT, Lawler!  I WILL SUE YOUR ASS!  YOU'RE A FUCKING ASSHOLE! (he POUNDS the desk) FUCK YOU!  FUCK YOU!  I WILL GET YOU FOR THIS!!! 
Freaked, Andy leaps up and storms out. 
LETTERMAN You said some pretty inflammatory things. 
LAWLER He thinks everything's a joke -- but it's not. (to Andy) Did you laugh when you were layin' in the hospital??

An unsure moment.  Dave glances at Lawler. 
Until, Andy stumbles back in.  He tries to calm himself. 
ANDY (cont'd) I am sorry.  I am sorry to use those words on television.  I apologize! I'm sorry! (demented) But YOU -- you're a MOTHERFUCKING ASSHOLE!!!! 
Andy slams Dave's desk.  Dave jerks nervously. 
Crazed, Andy looks down at Dave's coffee cup.  Uh-oh. Suddenly, Andy grabs the coffee and DUMPS it on Lawler! 
Lawler jumps, burned.  A SECURITY GUARD runs in. 
Andy screams and hurtles away.  He slams open the stage door and barrels out of sight.

Little Wendy gulps, then waves goodbye too.

Middle of the afternoon, Andy lies in bed.  Covers pulled up to his face, expression glum, he's like a tragic still-life. 
Suddenly DING-DONG!  It's the doorbell. 
Andy ignores this.  Beat.  Another DING-DONG!  Then KNOCKING. 
ANDY Go away. 
LYNNE (O.S.) It's me. 
ANDY Oh, it's open. 
The door opens.  Lynne enters, holding a carton of ice cream. 
LYNNE I brought you Haagen Dazs. Chocolate. 
ANDY (mournful) I don't deserve Haagen Daz.  I'm a horrible person. 
LYNNE Andy, you're not horrible.  You're just... complicated. 
ANDY You don't know the real me. 
LYNNE Andy... there is no real you. 
TIGHT - ANDY 
An astonished silence. 
And then... he slowly smiles. 
ANDY You're probably right. 
They both giggle. 
Andy studies her... looking at Lynne's face, body, eyes. Pause. 
ANDY Do you wanna move in together? 
Lynne smiles slyly.  She leans down and kisses him.

Andy sits disoriented in the living room.  Movers bustle around him.  Mirrors get leaned against opposing walls -- and he finds himself looking into multiple reflections of himself. 
In the b.g., Lynne arranges some vases, then hurries out. Andy opens a box and pulls out his old Howdy Doody doll.  He smiles, then places Howdy on the shelf next to the vases. 
Suddenly a phone on the floor RINGS.  He grins. 
ANDY Hey!  Our first phone call! (he scrambles for the phone) Hello? 
GEORGE (V.O.) Andy... it's me.  I've got some crummy news. (long beat) Taxi's been canceled. 
Silence. 
Andy has no response. 
GEORGE (V.O.) (cont'd) Do you want me to come over?  Talk about it? 
ANDY Um... no.  Uh, I'm sorta busy right now.  Thanks.  We'll get together next week. 
Andy hangs up.  He just sits there... confused... unsure how to react. 
Andy scratches his head -- then feels something odd.  He goes over to the mirror.  On the back of his neck... is an inflamed red pimple.  Andy grimaces. 
ANDY (cont'd) Yuck! 
INT. LA IMPROV, SHOWROOM - LATE NIGHT 
Very late -- a clock says 1:15.  A YOUNG COMIC is onstage, performing to the DOZEN audience members left. 
In back walks... Andy.  Unshaven, morose, he quietly approaches paternal owner BUDD FRIEDMAN.  Budd sees him, grins, and gives him a hearty hug.  Andy points at the stage and asks for something -- Budd eagerly nods. 
INT. LA IMPROV, SHOWROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT 
Budd is onstage. 
BUDD And now we have a treat for you late- night diehards.  The star of Taxi -- here in person, Andy Kaufman! 
ANDY Sir, do you have a problem? 
ZMUDA (AS JERK) Yeah, my problem is you're tired. 
Andy winces. 
ANDY I, I was asked to do this material - 
ZMUDA (AS JERK) Sure, because your new stuff's a bunch of crap.  Kaufman, people are sick of you.  The wrestling... the hoaxes... 
ANDY (defensive) Hey -- that stuff gets written-up in the papers -- 
ZMUDA (AS JERK) Who gives a shit?!  It's not funny! 
GEORGE - is dumbfounded. 
GEORGE (to himself) Why...?  Andy, why...? 
ON ANDY AND ZMUDA 
ZMUDA I used to think you were original. 
ANDY I was very original! 
ZMUDA Yeah, exactly -- "was"!  But now, you're creatively bankrupt. (he gleams cruelly) In fact, Ladies and Gentlemen, Kaufman's so desperate, he PAID me to do this tonight!!  I'm a plant. It's just a fresh coat of paint on an old broken-down routine. (back to Andy) Isn't that true??? 
Andy shudders. 
The audience averts their eyes. 
A painful silence. 
"Andy Kaufman" has been destroyed. 
EXT. LA IMPROV - LATER THAT NIGHT 
Andy and George walk sadly down the street.  There is a horrible gloom over them. 
ANDY The world thinks Andy Kaufman sucks. So I was just giving 'em what they want... 
GEORGE (sadly) Andy, they don't think you suck. They've just... lost a reason to love you. 
The guys stop walking.  George gently speaks. 
GEORGE (cont'd) You've gotta make the public embrace you again.  You have to win back their sympathy...

He nods. 
ANDY I'll come up with something.

LYNNE Andy!!... Where are you?  I've been worried sick... NOW??... Where do you want to meet?... Okay, I'll call them... 
Lynne's baffled. 
INT. DENNY'S - DAWN 
Late-night Hollywood weirdos mill about.  Andy sits with bleary Lynne, Zmuda, and George.  Zmuda admires the menu. 
ZMUDA Look at that Grand Slam!  Two eggs, two bacon, two sausage, two pancakes -- $2.99!  How do they do it? 
LYNNE They get you on the coffee. 
GEORGE (irritable) Excuse me -- but could Andy tell us why we're here??? 
All heads turn.  A long pause. 
Then -- Andy stiffly speaks. 
ANDY I have cancer. 
Beat.  Zmuda nods. 
ZMUDA Hey, that's good!  We can make that play. (spitballing) And we'll really drag it out.  You get better, you get worse... you die... 
GEORGE FORGET IT.  It's in terrible taste! I want nothing to do with this. 
Pause.  Lynne is puzzled. 
LYNNE Andy, are you serious? 
ZMUDA (grinning) Serious like a heart attack!  Hey, maybe I can push you around in some goofy wheelchair! 
Andy softly shakes his head. 
ANDY No, it's true.  I have lung cancer. 
GEORGE That's ridiculous.  You don't even smoke. 
ANDY (emphatic) I -- I got some freaky rare kind. It's called large-celled carcinoma.

The house is dark.  Lynne leads George into the shrouded living room... and Andy is sitting in a Lotus position, concentrating.  In front is a WILD-HAIRED MAN in a purple robe. 
WILD-HAIRED MAN I want you to visualize.  Visualize big, healthy white cells in your body.  Now visualize little cancer cells.  Now those big white cells are attacking the cancer cells... 
ANDY I see them... I see the white cells... 
In the corner -- George stares.  He's fighting his skepticism. 
CUT TO: 
INT. LAUREL CANYON HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - LATER THAT DAY 
The drapes are open.  Sunlight streams in.  Andy hugs the teacher goodbye, and the man leaves. 
George has been waiting in back. 
GEORGE What was that all about? 
ANDY It's visualization therapy.  He's helping me turn inward and fight the disease. 
Long beat. 
GEORGE He's an actor.  I remember him in "The In-Laws." 
Ah.  Andy's eyes widen.  His wheels are spinning fast. 
ANDY Uh, yes... that's true.  But he's also ordained in holistic medicine. 
ON GEORGE - He glares, stewing.  George is fed up. 
ON ANDY - An unspoken tension.  Then suddenly, he breaks down. 
ANDY (cont'd) George, what am I supposed to do?! I'm sick, and I'm tryin' to get better... but everyone's lookin' at me funny!  Even you come to my home and act like I'm puttin' on a skit! 
GEORGE You must take a little pleasure in it. 
ANDY Of course! (beat) But that doesn't mean I don't need everyone's support!  I can't be surrounded by negative energy. 
George shakes his head. 
GEORGE Andy, you're surrounded by what you create.  You are the KING of negative energy. 
ANDY (thrown) Y-yeah?  Well, then it has to stop! Because if these bad vibes get out... then everyone will be talkin' about how sick I am, and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, and then -- I'm dead. 
Andy struggles to remain composed.  George sighs. 
GEORGE So how can I help you...? 
ANDY I wanna go back to work and put on a happy show. (bright-eyed) The best show anybody's ever seen! 
GEORGE Do you wanna tour the clubs? 
ANDY No clubs.  I wanna reach the TOP! (beat) Carnegie Hall...! 
George gently smiles.

INT. NATIONAL ENQUIRER OFFICES - DAY 
A STAFF meeting at the National Enquirer. 
REPORTER #1 I'm working on a great cover story: I've got a guy in the lab at Cedars. He says Andy Kaufman is dying of lung cancer. 
Beat.  The room GROANS. 
EDITOR What bullshit!  No.  No more Kaufman stories!  He's burned us too many times! 
REPORTER #2 Yeah, he's definitely not dying. He's playing Carnegie Hall next month! 
The Reporter frowns. 
REPORTER #1 Jesus.  Only Kaufman would use cancer as a publicity stunt. 
INT. LAUREL CANYON HOUSE - NIGHT 
A 16mm PROJECTOR runs a scratchy 1930's movie short on the wall.  Smiling fake COWBOYS and COWGIRLS dance, the cowgirls straddling hobby horses.  They all SING. 
COWBOYS AND COWGIRLS "I've got spurs That jingle-jangle jingle..." 
WE WIDEN 
Andy, George and Zmuda watch.  Andy's face is enthralled like a kid. 
ANDY This is great.  The crowd's gonna love this! (giddy; thinking) Hey... do you still think any of those cowgirls are still alive? 
ZMUDA I dunno.  If they were, they'd be pushin' 80. 
ANDY Well, call SAG.  It'd be cool to get one on the show. (excited) I want the evening to build and build.  It's gonna have the most incredible ending: Singers, dancers, the "Hallelujah Chorus" -- then the sky opens, and Santa Claus comes flying down! 
He WHOOPS triumphantly.  She lives, like Frankenstein reborn!  The crowd CHEERS, surprised and giggling. 
ANDY Ladies and Gentlemen, she's alive! 
Huge APPLAUSE. 
CHOIR (O.S.) HALLELUJAH!  HALLELUJAH! 
ANDY Ladies and Gentlemen, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir!!! 
Rear curtains part, and the MORMON TABERNACLE CHOIR belts out the "Hallelujah Chorus"! 
It's spectacular.  The crowd goes nuts. 
ANDY (cont'd) Oh my gosh, it's the Rockettes! 
Yes indeed, TWO DOZEN ROCKETTES rush in from the sides, legs kicking high. 
The crowd WHOOS. 
ANDY (cont'd) Girls and Boys, it's Santa Claus!! 
Snow start falling, and SANTA ON HIS SLEIGH drops from above. 
The crowd screams with excitement.  It's unbelievable.  They leap to a standing ovation. 
In front are Stanley and Janice.  They start crying. 
Beaming Andy embraces Eleanor.  Then he takes the mike. 
ANDY (cont'd) And it's not over yet!!  'Cause I'm taking you all out to Milk and Cookies!! 
The crowd laughs. 
ANDY (cont'd) I'm serious!!!!!!! 
EXT. CARNEGIE HALL - MINUTES LATER 
A thousand people file out -- and THIRTY-FIVE SCHOOLBUSES are parked up and down Fifth Avenue!!!  The crowd is AWED. 
Andy euphorically marches out, pushing his endurance.  He's the Pied Piper. 
ANDY Single file!  Don't rush!  There's enough cookies for everyone!! 
EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - LATER THAT NIGHT 
The schoolbuses pull up to a school.  The disoriented passengers step out, not sure what to expect... 
INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, CAFETERIA - NIGHT 
The audience crowds inside... and LADY CAFETERIA WORKERS in hairnets are dispensing milk and cookies.  It's remarkable. 
At a little kids table sit Andy and Lynne.  Andy's face is pure joy.  He watches all the adults munching on their cookies, everyone giddy at the silliness of it all. 
Andy smiles beautifully.  He squeezes Lynne's hand, then whispers. 
ANDY I don't want this to ever end... 
EXT. NEW MEXICO DESERT - DAY 
A stucco SPA RESORT sits in the middle of the rocky desert. 
INT. SPA - SAME TIME 
A room with soft lighting and billowing curtains.  A New Age HEALER is laying crystals upon Andy's body. 
Andy COUGHS.  His hat is off, revealing he's bald. 
HEALER Now we'll place a blue crystal. Very high vibrations.  It's wonderful for it's healing powers. 
ANDY (spellbound) Okay.  Let's try two of those... and one of the pink ones. 
EXT. SPA - DAY 
Zmuda stands with a swarmy ADMINISTRATOR. 
ADMINISTRATOR Your friend is doing four crystal sessions a day, but it's just not helping. 
ZMUDA I know... (beat) The cancer's terminal. 
ADMINISTRATOR Yes.  That wasn't made particularly clear to us when he checked in... 
ZMUDA (irked) Look, personally, I think rubbing rocks on people is a load of horseshit.  But if it makes Andy happy, that's all that matters. 
The man purses his lips. 
ADMINISTRATOR I'm sorry to sound crass -- but we don't want to be "that health resort in New Mexico where Andy Kaufman died." (beat) I'm going to have to ask you to leave. 
Zmuda is speechless. 
INT. SPA, ANDY'S ROOM - LATER THAT DAY 
Zmuda angrily packs Andy's bags.  Zmuda is seething. 
But Andy is strangely calm and unaffected. 
ANDY It's okay, Bob.  It wasn't really working. (a gentle smile) We'll find something better. 
INT. LAUREL CANYON HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY 
ANDY (cont'd) He's my last chance. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. BAGUIO CITY, PHILIPPINES - DAY 
Baguio, a tiny scratched-in-the-dirt Philippine city. 
Suddenly, a rattletrap COMMUTER PLANE lurches out of the sky.  It hits a dirt runway.  Dust flies.  Chickens squawk and run. 
INT. BEAT UP TAXI, PHILIPPINES - DAY 
Andy, Lynne, and Zmuda ride through the impoverished city. 
Andy stares in amazement. 
EXT. CLINIC, PHILIPPINES - DAY 
They reach a brick building.  A sign says "CLINIC," with an eye over a triangle. 
INT. CLINIC, PHILIPPINES - DAY 
A NURSE hurriedly helps weakened Andy sign a bunch of forms. Money is handed over. 
Andy's clothes are stripped off.  They're thrown in a locker. 
INT. CLINIC OPERATION ROOM, PHILIPPINES - DAY 
A large white tiled room.  Lynne and Zmuda roll in pallid Andy, his limp body unmoving. 
Andy looks up... and there's a LONG LINE OF SICKLY PEOPLE. Primarily Japanese, emaciated, all stripped to their underwear and barely able to stand. 
They have a look of desperation and reverence. 
At the head of the line is JUN ROXAS at his work station: A bench, a sink, and ATTENDANTS with clean towels. 
A SICKLY WOMAN crawls onto the bench.  Jun impassively presses his hand into the fatty flesh of her stomach, kneading, searching.  Pause, then he removes some BLOODY GUTS. 
He flings them into a bucket. 
The woman cries out. 
Andy gasps. 
The woman is helped away. 
Jun turns to wash his hands.  An attendant gives him a towel to dry with.  Then a SICKLY MAN crawls up... 
Andy rolls closer.  He stares at all this with fear. Nervousness.  Hope. 
Jun impassively presses his hand against the man's head.  He concentrates, searching... then pulls out some BLOODY GUTS. 
He flings them into a bucket. 
The man shakes.  He is helped away. 
Andy is wide-eyed.  He gets closer... closer... 
More patients.  More bloody guts.  More sobbing. 
Andy's excitement builds. 
Then -- he reaches the front. 
A moment. 
Lynne and Zmuda stare into Andy's eyes, drawn in by his total belief.  They are overcome.  It feels like they're saying goodbye.  Lynne gives Andy a tender kiss.  Zmuda starts to shake his hand -- and instead hugs him tightly. 
Andy smiles, then the attendants lift him from the wheelchair.  They help him up to the bench. 
Andy lies down.  Fluorescent lights buzz overhead. 
He looks over, and Jun Roxas is washing his hands from the previous patient. 
Andy shivers, anticipating the miracle. 
Jun turns.  An attendant gives him a towel to dry off. 
Andy relaxes, readying for it all... 
He glances at Jun's hands.  Jun hands back the towel -- and under it the attendant quickly slips Jun a sack of animal intestines. 
Jun discreetly palms it.  He's a fake. 
CLOSEUP - ANDY 
A moment of stunned disbelief. 
He is shocked.  Outraged.  Disappointed.  Flabbergasted. 
The faith is meaningless.  The joke is cosmic.  The con man has been conned. 
Andy's overpowering emotions coalesce... and he starts to LAUGH. 
It's sidesplittingly funny.  Andy LAUGHS, and LAUGHS, and LAUGHS, like a crazy man with no salvation, the joy releasing him, the tears rolling down his cheeks. 
His face flushes with color.  Life sparkles in his eyes. Andy laughs and guffaws until he's hoarse.  This is the best gag of them all. 
SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

FADE IN 
EXT. FERRY LANDING - NEW ENGLAND SHORE - DAY The sparkling waters. The chirping spring day. We are on an isolated stretch of country shore , and a quiet, sheltered island is visible distantly across the Sound. There is asense of anticipation, excitement. VOICES can be heard. THE CAMERA is the POV of a VIDEO CAMERA, and a group of college kids wait just o.s. On-screen, however, for the moment, a proper, sweet-faced young COED faces the camera and -- reluctantly, under the urging of her friend behind the video lens - - sets the scene. 
SWEET COED (SHYLY) Hi... My name is Mary O'Reilly O'Toole O'Shea and...over there is the island my friend Muffy owns... It's spring break... and she's invited us over for the weekend, and we're waiting for the ferry now to take us there... (blushing, mortified to cameraman) I don't know what else to say! 
CAMERAMAN (CHAZ'S VOICE) Tell us something about yourself. 
SWEET COED Something about myself? Oh, Gee... (composing herself, earnestly) Well, I want to work with handicapped children... My parents are my best Friends... Next semester I start convent school, and I... fuck on the first date. 
O.S. her friends explode with LAUGHTER. Brassy former deb NIKKI BRASHEARS gives us a big, wet wink, dropping the act. 
SWEET COED/NIKKI April Fool... 
CHAZ'S VOICE Whoo! Outrageous woman! Nikki, you are my kind o' gal! 
He PANS THE CAMERA over to KIT-- a pretty, unaffected, natural beauty, bright and very much aware. 
CHAZ'S VOICE C'mon, Kit, how about you? 
Kit waves him off, laughing in spite of herself. She's got nothing to say. KIT Pass. 
CHAZ'S VOICE C'mon , Arch? Skip? 
He PANS over to the other two college boys on the dock here - ARCH, a big, good-natured, easygoing WASP jock (rugby and crew); and SKIP, Mr. Preppy, the perfect image of the lazy spoiled, indulged, and reckless upper-crust kid. Skip also happens to be Muffy's cousin. 
ARCH (ponders it with due consideration) Yeah, sure... I fuck on the first date... 
Skip cracks up. Arch's laughter follows. 
NIKKI (O.S.) Where's Rob? 
Chaz QUICK-PANS the camera back to Kit, following the action. 
CHAZ'S VOICE (teasing, with innuendo) Yeah, Kit, where is he? 
ARCH (O.S.) (MORE TEASING) Oh, Kit... 
Concerned, Kit keeps her humor anyway, waving the lens away again. 
KIT Oh, c'mon, Chaz, give me some room, will you? 
He does, finally shutting down the videopak. The image reverts to FILM again. 
NIKKI (looks at her, persisting) Well? INT. VOLVO WAGON IN MOTION - MAIN HIGHWAY - DAY 
CUT TO: 
The driver -- a still great-looking, turned-out Fairfield County-type SUBURBAN LADY -- and the passenger, ROB FERRIS a cleancut, goodlooking, 20 year old public school grad ­sit in uncomfortable silence on opposite ends of the front seat. 
ROB (gestures, awkwardly) Here'll be fine, thanks... 
EXT. HIGHWAY INTERSECTION - DAY 
The Volvo wagon pulls over. Rob drags out his daypack, too. 
ROB (ABASHED) Thanks... for the lift, I mean... 
SUBURBAN LADY (smiles, no reason for disappointment) It was a real lift for me, too, hon. 
A late model Detroit sedan slows at the intersection, turning off the highway to take the junction in the direction Rob is going. A road sign indicates: "BAR HARBOR MOUNT DESERT" in another direction. 
Rob hefts his gear, hurrying to flag the sedan. 
The Volvo wagon continues on, braking for the next undergraduate male hitchhiking down the road. 
INT. KITCHEN - ST. JOHN HOUSE- DAY CLOSE ON a wall calendar. A HAND reaches INTO FRAME, tearing off "MARCH" to begin "APRIL". 
WIDEN TO REVEAL CLARA, the middle-aged housekeeper and offseason caretaker for the house. With her overcoat and purse on one arm, she drops the "MARCH" calendar page in a wastebasket, then crosses to the pantry where a door and wooden steps lead down to the basement. 
CLARA (CALLING) The rooms are all in order, double- and triple-checked, and I'm on my way... 
Naked bodies writhing in heat. Women with their tongues sticking out in desparate desire... Nan tries to control her reaction to his stack of graphic pornographic video catalogues and magazines. 
CHAZ (CONT) The origins of American pornographic film. I'm taking an independent study this term. (the passion and commitment show) My advisor's really behind me on it. We're not gonna be sheltered college kids all our lives. Someday I'm gonna have kids -- you're gonna have kids ­ and someday that kid's gonna come up to me and say, 'God, Dad, porn's really a major part of our lives. You were there, how'd it get started?' I wanna be able to answer their questions. (SMILES) Besides, it's research I can do by myself. 
ROB AND KIT They keep their voices low. KIT (STILL MIFFED) That's not my point -- 
ROB You don't want me to hitch, you want me to buy a car. OK, but I'm a state university boy, I don't have the perks like some of you private college kids do. 
KIT Oh, c'mon, don't pull that. 
Rob just drops his arms in frustration. 
KIT (cont.) I mean, it may show something about your attitude toward me, always being late. 
ROB Kit... 
Arch's voice interrupts. 
ARCH'S VOICE (annoyed, loudly, overriding the other conversations) Hey, I'm really not interested anymore -- 
SKIP C'mon, just one more 
The others look up at the interruption. 
ANGLE 
Arch pushes the knife back into Skip's hand, tired of playing knife- toss. 
ARCH I said, enough's enough-- 
SKIP One more try, double or nothing. 
He flips the knife to Arch, handle first. 
ARCH (PISSED OFF) C'mon, give it a fuckin' rest! 
He flips it back hard. Something happens. Skip looks up stunned. Arch's voice catches in his throat in horror. ANOTHER ANGLE 
Skip stares back, disbelieving, looking down and pulling his hand away from his chest, where the blood begins to seep and the jackknife sticks out, buried hilt-deep between his ribs. 
SKIP (PALE) Oh, fuck. 
SKIP Nan screams. Skip stumbles, teetering there at the edge of the ferry. Rob and Chaz leap to their feet. The ferrymen both look up in disbelief. Arch steps forward to help. But Skip, weaving, topples and splashes overboard. He goes under. 
ARCH (panicked, hurrying to the side) I'll get him, I'll get him! 
But he stops just at the edge of the ferry, immobilized by fear. 
Rob rushes forward, with Chaz in reserve, pulling Arch out of ·the way. But Buck, the assistant ferryman, pre-empts them all, diving in. 
Arch, frozen, watches from the deck with the others. 
Buck resurfaces, but without any sign of Skip. Rob doesn't wait any longer. He pulls off his shoes and dives in. Chaz gets ready to follow suit. The panic mounts. Suddenly: 
SKIP'S VOICE Hi, this what you're looking for? 
THEY TURN; 
ANGLE CHANGE 
Skip pulls himself up, dripping, on the other side of the ferry. He holds up the knife -- and the padded sash beneath his shirt he used to imbed the knife -- and grins from ear to ear. The others stare, totally freaked. 
Arch lets go, jumping in the air. Rob and Buck surface, to see as well. 
ARCH We got 'em! Whoo-ee, did we nail 'em! CHAZ (as it dawns, to Skip) April Fools... you crazy jerks. You crazy motherfuckin' jerks... somebody could've gotten hurt out there! 
Relief descends. Rob isn't laughing. But nobody's more impressed than assistant Buck, still treading water. 
BUCK (GRINNING) SH-I-I-I-T 
NIKKI You maniacs... you almost gave us a heart attack! 
Kit glowers at them and gives Rob a hand to get out. 
ARCH (TO CHAZ) Well, at least we don't go in for this your-shoelace­is-untied crap! 
ROB (dripping, to Arch and Skip) I owe you one. 
SKIP (smiles, to Buck in the water) How's it goin' out there? 
MUFFY What's going on? Sam... what's wrong? 
CONSTABLE POTTER (IN DISGUST) Tricks. Pranks. Better ask your friends... Buck's been hurt. 'Cal just took him on over to the mainland. Just lucky I was here... 
She returns his stare in dread silence. He boards the ferry. 
CONSTABLE POTTER (CONT.) I came over to check on a report of some unauthorized activity in the area... Your dad around? 
She startles, the question 50 unanticipated. 
MUFFY No, he's in Sutton Place. Why? 
CONSTABLE POTTER No word from him, or anybody else? 
MUFFY (STILL PUZZLED) No... 
He tries the engine. Nothing. 
CONSTABLE POTTER Just like I thought. . Burned out. Worthless... 
He steps back onto the shore. 
CONSTABLE POTTER (CONT.) I'll have to borrow your outboard to get back to shore. 
MUFFY We keep all the keys on the board in the kitchen, but I think there's an extra one underneath the cushion there. She points to the boat seat. Potter is much obliged. 
EXT. ROAD - DAY 
CONSTABLE POTTER (to the others, sternly) I'm glad you're stuck here, all o' you. If there's anvthin' else, or anything happens to Buck... I want to know where to find you. 
The van moves slowly along a narrow road through the forest. From what we can see of its occupants, the mood is pretty grim. Behind it, the old island pick-up truck follows. 
INT. PICK-UP 
Rob drives with Kit and Skip beside him in the cab. Nobody says anything . Skip is off somewhere in his own private hell. Finally he reaches over to roll down his window, but the handle rotates uselessly in his grip. 
SKIP These goddamn windows! 
He starts banging violently on the door, on the window. 
SKIP They've never been fixed... 
KIT Look, Skip, it wasn't your fault. It was an accident. You didn't know. 
SKIP (BITTER) Sure. 
He leaves off his banging. Pause. 
ROB (SIGHS) What a way to start a weekend, huh. 
SKIP Muffy. Nothing bad ever happens to her. 
EXT. ST. JOHN HOUSE. DAY. 
It is a truly grand affair, two stories at least, rambling and picture-perfect with extensive tended grounds, garage, and outbuildings. Muffy gets out first, hopping around to the back to open the rear van gate for the bags. Nan beholds the house for the first time. NAN (OVERWHELMED) Oh; Muffy... 
Rob pulls the pick-up right behind them. 
INT. ENTRY HALL - DAY 
As they come in with their bags. 
MUFFY Well, there's an awful lot to be done with this place. 
ARCH You sound as if you own it. 
She helps with bags, shepherding them on ahead. 
MUFFY I will, if all goes well. Next month when I turn 21. It's my first- stage inheritance. 
HARVEY (AMAZED) First stage? What's your second? 
NIKKI (DRYLY) Texas. You might be talking to your future boss, Harve. 
CHAZ Mom, I am home! 
They all look to see him standing in the entrance to the living room. 
INT. LIVING ROOM 
NIKKI Come sit on daddy's knee, little girl... 
Nikki falls to the floor in hysterics. 
KIT My goodness, daddy, what big (BREAKING UP) ...what big... teeth you have. 
ALL The better to eat you with, my dear. 
INT. STUDY - LATE AFTERNOON 
A richly paneled room with a fireplace, desk, leather-upholstered chairs and lots of books. 
A door opens and Harvey steps through, looks back over his shoulder and enters. He is just snooping around. He surveys the books, the framed diplomas on the walls along with autographed photos of U.S. presidents and other heads of state. 
He steps over to the desk, opens a cigar box sitting there, takes out a cigar and slips it into his pocket. EXT. BACK LAWN - SUNSET 
Arch and Chaz are in the back lawn overlooking the sound. They are fooling around with Chaz's camera, maybe clowning a bit. 
EXT. VERANDA - THE SAME 
A'broad veranda which runs along the entire length of the back of the house. Skip and Nan are sitting on the railing, gazing over the sounds. Skip has a drink. 
SKIP (quietly, with deliberation) The poor boy can say, "Fuck you, Dad. I'm my own person." What is his father going to do? Kick him out of the house? Disinherit him? His life won't have changed that much. He's got nothing to lose. 
PAUSE. 
NAN His father's love. 
SKIP That's already been lost. Died a long, long time ago. 
NAN (SOFTLY) Skip, you're giving up. You're giving up before you've even gotten started. (BEAT) Look at how young we all are. How young and foolish and innocent and stupid... 
Skip raises his glass and gulps down the rest of his drink. 
EXT. OVERLOOK - DUSK 
A secluded area halfway down between the house and the shore. Rob sits alone on a wooden bench and thinks. O.S. the dinner bell sounds. 
EXT. VERANDA - DUSK 
With bell in hand, Muffy turns and heads back into the house. Chaz and Arch come up onto the porch and follow her in. 
INT. DINING ROOM ~ DUSK 
Rob is just coming in from outside as Muffy enters from the kitchen with the hot dogs and beans. Everyone else is standing around the table. CHAZ Boy, Muff, you sure know how to make a guy look forward to dessert. 
ARCH Please, God, let it be ding dongs. 
NIKKI St. John hospitality taken to the extreme. 
HARVEY I think it's real friendly. Makes me feel right at home. 
Everyone starts to sit down at his designated place. 
KIT How friendly will we feel once we've finished with those beans? 
ON NAN 
As soon as her ass hits the seat, she lets slip an outrageous fart. She springs to her feet, her face turning beet red. 
THE GROUP 
All conversation stops, each person looking for the guilty party. Nan discreetly sits back down: but again, as soon as her tail meets the chair, another blast escapes her... 
All eyes are on her as she reaches beneath her and pulls out a whoopee cushion. 
NAN You guys! 
Everybody laughs. 
KIT So it's going to be one of those dinners, huh? 
Arch is laughing the loudest when suddenly his chair collapses beneath him and he drops sprawling onto the floor. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Skip is searching through the darkened living room for something, while in the adjoining room dinner is proceeding quietly. INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT 
CLOSE ON- CHAZ' HAND 
NAN (TENTATIVELY) Can I make a toast? 
They turn attention toward her, and she stands, emboldened by their acceptance. NAN (CONT.) Well... Someone once said to me to cherish the friends you make in COLLEGE-- 
ARCH I cherish all the friends I make. 
NAN (CONTINUING) Because... they'll be the friends you cherish most the rest of your life. So, well, here's to us... here's to my life... because I'm very glad to be here, and to be a part of all of you... 
KIT Muffy, anything you want to add to that? 
MUFFY Why me? 
NIKKI Because you're the hostess. 
Muffy thinks for a moment, then adds... 
MUFFY In his "Life of Johnson" James Boswell said, "We cannot tell the precise moment when friendship is formed. As in filling a vessel drop by drop, there is at last a drop which makes it run over; so in a series of kindnesses, there is at last one which makes the heart run over." 
Arch has started to make snoring sounds. 
MUFFY (cont.) So with this toast may our hearts run over and our friendships be formed. 
They stand unanimously, raise their glasses in agreement, start to drink and spill it all down the front of their shirts. 
Dribble glasses. 
Everybody groans. 
MUFFY (GRINNING MISCHIEVOUSLY) April Fool. INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY ­ NIGHT 
Muffy shows Nikki, the last of them, to her room. Nan says goodnight from her door. 
NAN Goodnight. 
MUFFY Goodnight. 
Muffy leads Nikki to a narrow, sparse single, popping open the door. 
NIKKI Oh, great. Quarantine. 
MUFFY (IMPISHLY) Just holler if you need anything. 
NIKKI Another room. (TURNS) Muffy... 
Muffy turns back to her. 
NIKKI (cont.) (beat, seriously) I know you and Arch had something going before I met him... 
MUFFY (SMILES) Arch is sweet, but he's only got two expressions. Collar up and collar down. 
NIKKI I found that out-- (BEAT) I guess what I'm trying to say is... you always seem to get there first... but this time Chaz is mine, OK? 
MUFFY (AMUSED) What about Hal? 
NIKKI ' Harvey? Mr. Junior Achievement? Oh please... 
Muffy returns her smile,continuing down the corridor. INT. ARCH'S POOM - UPSTAIRS - NIGHT 
Arch throws his duffle bag on a bed, delighted. It's a private suite with two beds. 
ARCH Hey, all right... ladies, we are qonna have privacy... 
He turns his collar up on his polo shirt, then eagerly pushes the two beds together. 
The other door (to the connecting bathroom) swings open. Arch's face drops as Chaz walks in, lugging his gear. 
ARCH (CONT.) You gotta be kiddin'... 
CHAZ (unloading his gear). Unless Muffy knows something about us we don't. 
He blows Arch a kiss, pulling the two beds apart again. 
INT. HARVEY'S ROOM - NIGHT 
CLOSE UP a match flaring to life. 
WIDEN TO FEVEAL Harvey lighting the cigar he took earlier out of the study. He puffs on it contentedly, imagining himself a man of power. Then he steps over to the bed and opens his suitcase to begin unpacking. 
HARVEY (to himself; rehearsing) Don't tell me you've never thought of me in that way, Muffy. I felt a spark between us the very first moment we laid eyes on each other... in Econ 345. Why, just think of it, Muffy... with my talent and your... money. 
RETURN ANGLE 
She shrinks back from them with a frightened, apologetic smile. Scrambled eggs bubble in the skillet on the burner. 
MUFFY I... I was hungry... 
She bumps against the stove, backing away. She self-consciously runs a hand through her hair. 
MUFFY (cont.) I... I must look a mess... 
She scuttles out the door to the utility room and the back stairs beyond, leaving the eggs to burn. 
INT. BACK STAIRS ­ DAY 
Arch encounters her, too, as he comes bounding down in his workout shorts. 
ARCH Morning! She backs away from him, scurrying up the stairs. 
MUFFY I... forgot to get dressed... 
INT. KITCHEN - DAY 
Arch enters, joining his wonderment to Rob and Kit's. ARCH Who made her night? 
EXT. BACK PORCH - DAY - LATER 
CUT TO: 
Arch, Chaz, Harvey and Nikki burst out the door in old clothes, sweats, shorts, whatever -- an unlikely foursome for some informal soccer scrimmaging. 
ARCH (always in search of more players) Where's Skip? 
CHAZ That depends on what he's on. 
Rob and Kit cross their path, heading down to the water in their swimsuits and overshirts. 
NIKKI You gotta be kidding... 
ARCH (teasingly, an invitation) Nan? What about it? 
Nan watches from the porch, book in hand. 
NAN Oh, no, thanks. (FALSELY) Besides, I thought I'd wait and see what Muffy wanted to do... 
Arch shrugs and the soccer free-for-all begins in earnest, with special attention given to the interplay between Harvey and Nikki. 
Up on the porch, Nan finally sees Muffy emerging from the distant tool shed. Muffy is dressed plainly, oddly conventional, with a perceptible sense of disorder about her. She keeps to herself, turning toward the woods beyond, with cutting blade and mushroom basket in hand. 
Nan puts down her book, hurrying off the porch. But by the timeshe looks up again, Muffy is gone... EXT. DOCK - DAY 
Rob and Kit are standing together on the dock. He is dripping wet and covered with goose flesh. She has not been in yet. And while he is vigorously toweling off his arms and chest, trying to get the blood circulating again, she stands behind him with another towel and gently, lovingly dries his back. She finishes and he steps away from her and gazes out across the sound. 
KIT Rob? What's wrong? 
Pause. 
ROB I swear it wasn't this cold yesterday . 
This isn't what she meant, and he knows it. 
KIT Are you giving up? 
ROB (turning to her; gently) What about you? What about your future? You're the one with the four point. (DEJECTED) ...maybe it's crazy--you investing so much energy in me. 
KIT (QUIETLY) I don't know. I'm scared. I don't know if I want what Mom and everybody else expects of me. I don't want to go to law school. 
ROB (PROTESTING) You've got a great mind 
KIT ...only it's not made up. 
Smiling sadly, he crosses to her, puts his arms around her. 
ROB Great... Do you realize how perfectly unmatched we are? 
KIT It's made up about one thing though. 
ROB Yeah? What's that? She looks up and kisses him softly. 
ROB Will you feel the same about me a year from now? Two years, five years from now? 
CHAZ Me too! 
EXT. DOCK - DAY 
As Rob, Arch and Chaz come running down to the water. They stop and look around, seeing nothing. 
No answer. 
ARCH (aloud: for Skip) Hey, asshole! 
CHAZ Wait a minute! Look at this! 
He has found on the little pebbled beach beside the dock, Skip's switchblade. It is in pieces. There's blood on the broken blade. 
CHAZ This was Skip's. ARCH What do you think? That guy on the ferry? 
ROB I don't know. I don't know what to think. 
ARCH I say we go looking for him, him or Skip. One of them's bound to still be around... somewhere. 
CHAZ You mean split up? 
ROB Let's not take any chances. He was... He was pretty big. 
ARCH No sucker's taken me yet. 
He rips a loose board off the dock for a club. 
EXT. UTILITY ROOM - HOUSE ­ DAY 
In the gathering twilight, Muffy puts the basket of mushrooms away on a shelf. Someone grabs her wrist. She gasps. It's Nan. Nan steps from the shadows. 
NAN I know why you're avoiding me... (DISTRAUGHT) I guess it's your idea of a joke... that's why you invited me. How'd you find out? From one of his preppy 'friends'? Who else have you told?... Who else knows, except the father! 
MUFFY (ASTONISHED) I... don't know what you're talking about. 
NAN Oh? The tape just got there? You know very well... my abortion! 
She comes apart, in tears. Muffy stares, uncomprehending. 
NAN (cont.) I thought you wanted to be friends... you think you can play with people's feelings just because you're rich and can do what you want. Well, you can't...! 
She rushes out the rear door. Muffy tries to recover, confused. 
She continues on to the back entrance to the kitchen. INT. KITCHEN - DAY 
Swinging open the door, she almost runs into Harvey. 
HARVEY (SHEEPISHLY) Sorry... I was just checkin' to make sure everybody was all right. 
He beats a hasty retreat the other way, passing Nikki on her way in Nikki raises an eyebrow at Muffy, misinterpreting the tension in the air. 
NIKKI Harvey? No kidding'? 
Maybe that explains your clothes. 
MUFFY (NERVOUSLY) What d'you, mean? 
NIKKI Oh, c'mon. 
Muffy exits hurriedly, upset. 
EXT. WOODS - DAY 
The path is narrow and tortuous . Arch uses his club to clear the way, trying to follow its twists and turns. He also tries to make vocal contact. 
ARCH Hey, shithead! chickendick!... yeah, you! Skip! 
He moves deeper and deeper into the forest. 
LOW ANGLE 
Up ahead on the pathway a thick, black viper slithers out of the undergrowth, stops, sensing Arch's presence, and coils itself against his approach. 
WIDER 
as Arch stalks forward, not looking at the ground. 
LOW ANGLE ARCH (THUNDERING ) Skip! 
KIT Rob? No, we haven 't been able to get through to the mainland yet. 
Muffy eases. Kit turns the tap to fill the kettle. The pipes begin to BANG. The tap sputters and coughs out a spurt of brown water before running dry. 
L1UFFY Oh... ·the main... it's probably broken. 
KIT (STUNNED) No water? 
Nikki and Harvey enter, having heard the pipes banging. 
NIKKI What's happening. 
KIT No water. NIKKI What! 
MUFFY It happens sometime... But there's still the well all the island homes have some kind of pump... or well... for emergencies. 
Nikki reaches for a large flashlight beam. 
NIKKI Jesus. I'll go. Just point me in the right direction. 
HARVEY (GALLANTLY) Not without me. 
Harvey accompanies Nikki out the back door, leaving Kit and Muffy alone again. 
MUFFY (bearing up under Kit's stare) I'm not worried. I'm sure those two... Skip and Art... they're just up to some kind of stupid trick . . . 
Kit moves out of the kitchen uneasily. 
EXT. WELL - DUSK Nikki milkes ghost sound8, following Harvey out through the dark. It makes him nervous. 
HARVEY (UNCOMFORTABLY) I don't think you should really do that. 
NIKKI (SEEING) Is that it? 
The well is the old-fashioned kind. 
NIKKI (cont.) Boy, when she said `well,' she really meant 'well'. who dug this thing? Pocahontas? 
She reaches for the wooden bucket attached by metal nook to the thick rope. Harvey pre-empts. 
HARVEY Here, let me do it. I've probably had more experience than you. 
NIKKI You mean, back home on the farm? HARVEY I know you think I'm a hick, but I'd like to change your mind about that, if you'd only give me the chance. 
NIKKI Why? 
HARVEY Because, I'd really like to plow your field. 
NIKKI (SMILES" IMPRESSED) Draw me some water. 
He's glad to oblige, opening the hinged wood well cover and lowering the bucket slowly. The dark hole seems to go on forever. Suddenly, there's a muffled CLATTER deep within the well. 
HARVEY Aw, crap... 
NIKKI What happened? 
HARVEY I lost the bucket. 
NIKKI Harve. 
HARVEY Hal. The rope was rotten, any fool coulda seen that. 
NIKKI You didn't. 
HARVEY Here, shine your light down so I can get a fix on it. 
She rises on her toes, flashing the powerful beam down the dank hole. Harvey bends over to look. A rotted piece of the well cover breaks off in his hand. He lurches forward. 
HARVEY Oh... oh, Jesus! 
He slams back in ashen horror. 
NIKKI (STARTLED} ...what... HARVEY Stay back! Don't look! 
NIKKI I'm a big girl now. I think I ·can handle a few spiders and FROGS --- 
She shines the beam down again, bending in for a look. 
HARVEY NIKKI -- 
HARVEY It's all right. I can keep watch on the stairs. 
Rob ho1ds out his hand to her. She takes it and they walk together toward the stairs. 
INT. MUFFY' S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Muffy enters, closes the door quietly and locks it behind her. She crosses to her bed, slowly sits down and loses herself in troubled thought about everything that is going on. 
INT. MAIN STAIRWAY ­ NIGHT 
Harvey steps up to the halfway landing and sits down. He looks above, looks below, then opens a magazine and begins thumbing through it. 
INT. NIKKI'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Nikki's suitcase is open on the bed, and she is moving nervously about the room, gathering her things and cramming them into it. 
CHAZ Nikki, come on... NIKKI What do you mean, Nikki, come on? Don't give me any of this Nikki, come on. 
CHAZ What are you doing? 
NIKKI Look, stay if you like. Lock your door. Dig a trench. Hang out. But once I leave this place, I'm never coming back. 
She walks out the door, and Chaz follows her to... 
INT. UPSTAIRS HALL - SAME 
They cross the hall. 
CHAZ (catching up to her) We're all supposed to stay together here. 
NIKKI Yeah, that's been real effective... 
She goes into... 
INT. BATHROOM - SAME 
...and starts to collect all her stuff from in here. Chaz comes in behind her. 
CHAZ So what are you going to do? Just waltz on down to the pier. By yourself. Check your bag with the porter. Then wait for an ocean liner to happen by and pick you up. Is that it? 
NIKKI, (pushing past him) I can't stay here any longer. 
She goes back out into the hallway. Chaz follows. 
INT. UPSTAIRS HALL - SAME 
as they cross back to Nikki's bedroom. 
CHAZ What if the Constable never even comes? 
NIKKI Then I'll swim all the way back to the mainland... I can be strong if I have to. INT. NIKKI'S ROOM - NIGHT 
as they re-enter. 
CHAZ Look, just relax-- 
NIKKI Three people are dead and you're telling me to relax? CHAZ Nikki, now just hold on a minute, and look at me. Look at me. 
She stops and looks at him. 
CHAZ (CONT.) Now, am I nervous? Yes. Maybe even a little bit scared? Yes. Am I running around like a chicken with its head cut off? 
NIKKI Nice image. 
CHAZ No. (BEAT) I mean, come on, babe. Lighten up a little, huh? 
He quickly slips the S&M mask over his head, clowning around. 
CHAZ (CONT.) (MUFFLED) Look at this. What, me worry? 
NIKKI Very funny, Chaz. 
CHAZ (MUFFLED) You've got to look on the bright side of things. Everything'll be all right... Huh? Huh? 
NIKKI Don't be a jerk. 
CHAZ (MUFFLED) Oh. Now I'm turning you on. Right? 
NIKKI, Take that thing off. CHAZ (MUFFLED) Why? I kind of like it in here. (moving blindly toward her) Kiss me, you savage she-devil. 
KIT She's been up here. 
ROB So? She moves toward them while Rob stays by the windows looking out. As she gets closer to the dolls, however, Kit realizes that they have not just been stuck there haphazardly. 
KIT (ALARMED) Rob? 
Rob comes over to join her as we CUT TO: 
HER POV 
of the dolls as the flashlight moves across them, slowly revealing them one by one. The last to be seen are a Barbie and the heads of two Kens stuck in a bowl of water. 
ROB AND KlT 
staring at them, frightened and astonished. 
ROB Jesus... 
KIT (LOSING IT) Rob? . . . 
ROB It's Arch and Skip and Nan. 
KIT Rob??... 
ROB Wait... 
He takes the flashlight from her and reveals two more: a Barbie and a Ken lying next to each other with no clothes on, both of them splattered with bright red nail polish. 
ROB What are these other two? 
Suddenly the room is flooded with light. Rob turns sharply and sees outside the window the Constable's flare hanging in the night sky. 
ROB He's here! 
O.S. there is a PISTOL SHOT from downstairs. Kit screams. ROB Come on! 
He jumps to his feet, grabs hold of her hand and pulls her with him out of the attic. 
INT. UPSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT 
as they come racing down from the attic. Rob heads for the main staircase... 
ROB Hal! 
...while Kit runs down the hall to Nikki's room and flings open the door. 
KIT Nikki? 
She isn't there. 
Kit backs into the hallway. Downstairs O.S. she can hear Rob moving about, calling for Harvey, but up here all is quiet and threatening. 
She hurries silently down to Chaz' room, opens the door and steps inside. 
INT. CHAZ' ROOM - NIGHT 
It is dark again in here, but the video camera is still operating. Kit closes the door behind her and leans forward, barely whispering... 
KIT Chaz?... Nikki?... 
She turns on the light and sees the bed, both beds: they are drenched in blood. 
Kit reaches for the doorknob. It comes off in her hand. 
KIT Rob!!! 
She's frantically pounding on the door and trying to jam the doorknob back in, to get it to work. 
There's a NOISE outside the window. She turns aghast. Suddenly the door flies open. ROB (ENTERING) I can't find Hal-- 
He stops in mid-sentence as he sees the beds. Kit is already through the door. Rob follows her out. 
INT. UPSTAIRS HALL . - NIGHT 
Rob is running with her toward the stairs. 
KIT Rob, what about Muffy? 
ROB Forget her! 
ROB The house. Didn't Muffy say there was another key back in the kitchen? 
KIT (IN DREAD) Oh, no... 
ROB We've got no choice. 
KIT I know. 
ROB Shit. 
PAUSE 
KIT Rob? 
ROB Huh? 
KIT Rob, I really don't want to go back there. 
ROB I know. 
KIT Shit. 
Another pause. Neither one is making the move to go. 
ROB I'd have you stay here, but-- 
KIT No. 
ROB (BEAT) Listen, Kit, we'll get out of here, I promise you. We've been through so much together... 
She has started to cry softly. ROB (cont.) ...it isn't going to end here. 
KIT (BEING BRAVE) Okay. 
He kisses her. Pause. 
ROB Well... 
KIT Yeah... 
ROB Let's go. 
KIT Let's go. 
ROB Let's go. 
Brief pause, then he turns to go. 
ROB Shit... 
They move slowly off the dock. 
EXT. GROUNDS OF HOUSE - NIGHT 
Rob and Kit move up to the shrubbery skirting the back lawn and gaze across at the house. It is completely dark within and remains wrapped in silence as before. 
KIT Rob, look! The doors. They've been closed. 
Sure enough, the doors they come out by minutes ago, the ones they didn't stop to close, are now shut tight. 
ROB Come on. 
They move stealthily through the bushes around to the side of the house. They stop. 
ROB There. He is pointing toward the open basement window across a thirty foot space of clear lawn. 
ROB That's how we're going in. 
Kit swallows hard. 
She nods. 
ROB Are you with me? 
They break from their cover and run, keeping low, to the side of the house. Rob peers through the window into the darkness inside , pushes the transom all the way open, and then drags himself through on his belly. 
INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT 
He drops to the floor, turning to give Kit a hand. She enters the same, dusting herself off next to him. Rob turns on the flashlight, using it cautiously. 
INT. PANTRY ­ NIGHT 
Kit scrambles up behind him. They can hear Buffy outside in the yard APPROACHING the kitchen door. 
INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT 
Rob and Kit hurry in. Rob searches frantically for the key board. 
ROB The boat key... it's gotta be here... 
His flashlight sweeps the walls of shelves. Suddenly, Buffy is at the kitchen door. Though the door in locked, there's no bolt or chain to fully secure it. The knob RATTLES furiously under Buffy's grip, the door SHUDDERS. 
Rob spots a walk-in cupboard. He hurries to it. Kit gropes along the shelves, searching the objects hanging along the distant wall. 
KITCHEN DOOR 
A long, ugly-looking knife blade slips in through the crack in the door. Buffy is using it to try to pry open the door. 
CUPBOARD 
Rob opens the door. Success. His beam falls on the key board on the inner wall. 
ROB Kit... I 
He steps in, following his beam into the darkness. The cupboard door SLAMS shut behind him. He turns, trapped. 
CLOSE ANGLE - KITCHEN DOOR 
The door springs open. 
KITCHEN 
Kit spins, crying out as she sees: 
HER POV 
The shadowed figure of BUFFY, barefooted, disheveled, in a smock, dagger in hand. She advances, breathing heavily. KIT 
stumbles back desperately. 
KIT No... 
INT. CUPBOARD Rob is desperately trying to break out, but the door won't open. 
ROB Kit! Let me out! Let me out of here! Kit!! 
He is kicking the door, hurling himself at the door, but all to no effect. He barely has room to maneuver. 
KIT (O.S.) Rob!!! 
INT. KITCHEN Kit turns to Rob's voice, takes a step toward the cupboard, but suddenly Buffy is there, cutting her off. 
Kit backes away, into the dining room. 
INT. CUPBOARD 
ROB (POUNDING FUTILELY) Kit! Run, Kit, run! 
INT. DINING ROOM 
Kit reels back under Buffy's steady advance. Kit can't see her clearly in the dim light, but she can make out, beneath Buffy's wild, stringy, dangling hair, the madness, the likeness of Muffy -- the familiar face somehow twisted by hate and madness into a stiff, hideous, unnatural deformation. 
Buffy closes in, readying the long, greedy knife. 
INT. CUPBOARD 
Rob, still struggling, knows Kit is about to die. 
ROB Kit! I love you! 
INT . DINING R.OOM 
Cornered, helpless, Kit stumbles back toward the closed double doors that lead to the living room. KIT Buffy?... please, we didn't mean any harm... we're leaving... we just want to go home... please... please... 
Buffy raises the dagger in hand. 
INT. CUPBOARD 
No longer trying to escape. It's hopeless. 
ROB (TO OTHERS) And you guys played along? 
ARCH Don't look at me! 
NIKKI We all got sucked in just as bad as you! MUFFY Once they were killed off, yes. Everybody had to cooperate. Otherwise, none of it would have worked! 
ROB So I guess there's no crazy twin sister Buffy? 
MUFFY Oh, there's a crazy twin all right, but his name isn't Buffy. 
NIKKI His name? 
Muffy smiles, directing attention toward "cousin" Skip. 
CHAZ Skip?! 
KIT He's your brother?! 
ARCH You bastard, you were in on the whole deal, too. 
SKIP (PROTESTING) Only the set-up. Muffy told me to say I was her cousin and to pull that prank on the ferry. I had no idea what was going to happen with Buck. 
MUFFY (INTRODUCING) Buck Williams. make-up artist par excellence, from Hollywood. 
Buck reaches down and tosses Arch's decapitated head to him. 
BUCK Here, catch. 
Arch bobbles the head nervously. The others laugh. 
BUCK Just some old props I redressed with the help of photographs Muffy sent me. 
NIKKI It sure fooled me. 
ARCH (TO SKIP) So what castle are you going to inherit? CONSTABLE POTTER (CRITICALLY) Well, first he's got to prove he can manage his own allowance. 
KIT (to the Constable) Which means, I guess, that you're no constable either. 
MUFFY Kit Graham, meet my Uncle Frank St. John of St. John et Freres, Wall Street. 
Uncle Frank smiles and waves at Kit, but Harvey steps right over to him and starts pumping his hand. 
HARVEY Hi! Harvey "Hal" Edison, Jr. Pleased to meet you, sir. 
MUFFY Usually we don't even see Uncle Frank in the summer, he's so busy. But this time he made an exception. UNCLE FRANK I haven't had this much fun since my Hasty pudding Show sophomore year at Harvard. God, lowe you kids! 
FERRYMAN CAL (EAGERLY) How'd I do? I never did no acting before. Boy, was I shaking! 
MUFFY Cal's our regular ferryman between the mainland and the islands around here... but I thought he was up to the dramatic challenge. (BEAT: SMILING) Well, that's it. Now you know it all. 
NIKKI We have been had. 
ROB You're lucky you didn't get yourself killed. 
MUFFY (LAUGHING) I almost did with Harvey. And who could know there would be a snake out in the woods with Arch? But with the paying guests, they'll know what they're in for: and the scenario won't be nearly so extreme. 
UNCLE FRANK Otherwise, even Lloyd's of London won't cover you. MUFFY ...And I regret that, well, some of those fake clues I planted in the bedrooms I guess were taken too seriously. I'm sorry about that. 
She avoids looking at Nan so as not to draw attention to her. 
MUFFY (cont.) But we had fun, didn't we? I mean, come on. 
She starts passing .out chilled champagne bottles to the men to open, and setting up glasses on a sideboard. 
MUFFY (cont.) I know I'll never forget this weekend for as long as I live. 
ARCH You're telling me. Man, when I was swinging around out there in the woods, I nearly crapped my pants. 
CAL What do you mean, nearly? I was there, remember? 
Silence. Arch turns red. 
CHAZ (QUIETLY) Arch? You browned your trousers? 
ARCH (BEAT; STAMMERING) Well... I... 
UNCLE FRANK (GOOD-NATUREDLY) It's all right, Arch. They'll be out of the dryer soon. 
Suddenly everyone roars with laughter. Champagne corks start popping, and before you know it, the scene is resembling the locker room of the winning team of a championship series. 
Rob and Kit come out the door and stop beside Muffy. 
More honking. 
KIT Well, I hate to say it -- I still ought to kill you -- but thanks. (THEY HUG) See you back there. 
UNCLE FRANK Come on. If time is money, we're losing a fortune. 
Nikki now runs out followed closely by Harvey. They say their quick farewells and move along to the waiting vehicles. 
Harvey discreetly opts to ride in the pickup, while Nikki climbs aboard the van, passing Chaz who just glares at her. He knows. Finally Nan comes out of the house. With a curt nod to Muffy, she heads on toward the van when... 
MUFFY Nan! 
She hurries to catch up with her. 
MUFFY Let me say again how sorry I am. It wasn't intended. NAN And now all is forgiven. I played along, didn't I? What's done is done. (BEAT) I've learned a lot, Muffy, I really have. I suppose I should say thank you, but I don't think I would be able to without it sounding false. So I'll just say goodbye. (beat; an afterthought) Thanks for showing me your house. 
She turns and crosses to the van and climbs aboard. The others callout their last goodbyes. Muffy waves, and then they are gone and Muffy turns and walks forlornly back into her house. 
EXT. FERRY LANDING - MORNING 
Cal and Uncle Frank are the first ones onto the ferry. 
UNCLE FRANK Cal, I want to thank you personally. You've been a real sport about this. 
CAL Aw, it was fun. 
UNCLE FRANK I know you've had your eye on that p1ace ever since we were kids. And I'm sure we could make a deal with you. I know you haven't been spending your money on anything else all these years... But... this time it just isn't in the cards. 
CAL It's still in the family. 
UNCLE FRANK Yes, that's the way. 
He moves on. Others are passing them now. Chaz stops and wags his finger at Cal. 
CHAZ This time, no funny business. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING 
Muffy stand, overlooking the mess. Not knowing exactly where to begin, she starts emptying ashtrays into each other, then just stops. 
She walks out of the living room and through the entry hall and slowly climbs the stairs. EXT. SOUND ­ DAY 
From far away the ferry can be seen chugging away, slowly returning to the mainland. 
EXT. FERRY - DAY 
closer now we can see what's happening on board... Rob and Skip lean against the rail and talk quietly. Kit and Arch and Buck sit together and chat... Chaz sits alone, and Nikki sits apart from him, also alone. 
Nan is up front, gazing out over the bow, while Harvey stands beside her trying to make conversation. Finally, he gives up and strolls to the back of the craft, pointedly passing Nikki. 
He alights next to Uncle Frank, who has his briefcase open on his lap. 
Now Nikki stands and goes and sits down next to Chaz. 
CHAZ (BEAT) Feeling better? 
NIKKI (QUIETLY) I'm okay now, thanks. 
Pause. 
NIKKI Chaz, I'm sorry. 
CHAZ Why? What do we mean to each other anyway? 
NIKKI More than this a couple of days ago. 
CHAZ (SMILES SADLY) A couple of days ago... A couple of days ago I was a great, young, budding filmmaker who was going to turn pornography into high art. Today I'm just a stupid college kid with a toy camera and about as much idea as where he's going as... as... 
He gives up. 
NIKKI (TENDERLY) Don't be down. CHAZ Sure. 
Pause. 
NIKKI I'll tell you what I've learned from all this. I'm tired of having one fling after another. I don't want any more of that. I want a boyfriend. (BEAT) Chaz? Will you be my boyfriend? 
He looks at her, slowly softening. Yes, he will. 
The phone on the bedstand RINGS. Muffy answers it on the second ring. 
MUFFY (SLEEPILY) H'lo? 
INTERCUT WITH: 
EXT. LANDING - DAY 
Skip is talking on a pay phone. 
SKIP (CHEERILY) Hi, it's me. Surprise. 
MUFFY (grumpily, stirring) What'd you forget now? 
SKIP Nothing. Just calling to tell you the party's not over. 
She moans. 
MUFFY I know. The clean-up's going to take Clara and me at least a week. 
SKIP No, I mean, some of the gang's planning on coming back to give you some of your own medicine. 
CU MUFFY 
Coming awake. 
MUFFY You're kidding. SKIP Does a bear shit in the woods? 
MUFFY Those bastards... 
SKIP Hey, they're your friends. 
MUFFY Which ones? 
SKIP That wouldn't be very sporting if I told you, would it? 
MUFFY (INSISTENT) Skip... 
SKIP Rob and Kit and Nikki and Chaz. 
MUFFY Figures... Thanks. 
SKIP Well, Uncle Frank told me about his recommendations. So, I didn't want you to think there were any hard feelings. 
MUFFY (AFFECTIONATELY) Oh, Skip, you dope. You know Daddy'll come around just as soon as you decide to buckle down. 
SKIP Yeah... (BEAT) Anyway, don't let the bastards eat you up. 
MUFFY I'll try not to act too surprised when they arrive. 
SKIP I love you, Sis. 
MUFFY You too, goofball. 
Skip hangs up. 
ARCH (O.S.) Asshole. SKIP I beg your pardon? 
ANGLE WIDENS to include Arch, who has been standing beside Skip the entire time. 
ARCH It was even your idea. 
SKIP A petty consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds. 
ARCH Bullshit. St. John blood is thicker than water, that's what you mean. 
SKIP (ARCHLY SARCASTIC) Don't you know? Old money sticks together. 
Arch goes to his car and drives away. 
At some distance, Harvey is ·chasing down Uncle Frank as the latter closes in on his Mercedes sedan. 
HARVEY Well, can I look you up in a couple of months? Maybe you could arrange a job interview for me. 
UNCLE FRANK Sure, sure . (reaches into his pocket) Here's my card. 
HARVEY (TAKING IT) Thank you, sir. Thanks a lot. I sure appreciate it, and it's been a real pleasure meeting you. 
But Uncle Frank is already in the car and starting it up. Harvey looks down at the card. 
MUFFY Nikki, what on earth are you doing here? Is something wrong? 
NIKKI No, no, nothing's wrong. Chaz and I just figured there was nothing we had to get back to that couldn't wait and you could probably use a hand with the clean-up. It's our way of saying thank you. 
MUFFY Oh, great. Where is Chaz? 
Nikki is already moving into the living room. 
NIKKI Putting the boat up in the old boathouse. He'll be up in a minute. 
EXT. DOCK AND BOAT HOUSE ­ NIGHT 
Nobody around and no sign of a boat... 
EXT. FRONT OF THE HOUSE - NIGHT 
...still and waiting 
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Muffy and Nikki are seated across from each other. 
NIKKI I wonder what's keeping Chaz? He should have been up here by now. 
MUFFY Maybe he stopped to shit in the woods. You know Chaz. 
NIKKI Still... I'm beginning to not like this. 
MUFFY By the way, where did you get the boat to come back here? 
NIKKI The boat? Oh, Cal gave us one. 
MUFFY I see. 
PAUSE. NIKKI Listen, I need a drink of water. (RISING) You just stay here. I can get it myself. 
She walks out of the living room. Muffy looks after her and smiles to herself. 
INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT 
as Nikki enters. She doesn't turn on any lights, but simply crosses to one of the kitchen windows and opens it. 
She gazes out into the night for a moment, then backs out of the kitchen... 
INT. DINING ROM - NIGHT 
...pulling the swinging door closed behind her. She turns, takes two steps toward the living room and stops; remembering her water. 
She goes back to the kitchen door, but suddenly it will not open for her. Frustrated, she heads back through the dining room, but stops dead halfway across and turns slowly and looks back at the kitchen door. She goes out of the dining room... 
INT . DOWNSTAIRS HALL - SAME 
...and walks up to the other door into the kitchen. It too it's closed and will not yield. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
as Nikki returns. 
MUFFY What about your water? 
NIKKL Oh', uh, I drank 'it in there. (BEAT) Listen. Muffy , I'm really getting worried about Chaz. I think we should go out and see what's happened. 
MUFFY That's okay. You go. I'll wait here. 
NIKKI No, really. I don't want to go alone. I'm still scared from last night. Please come with me. MUFFY I'm sure Chaz is fine. I'll stay here by the phone just in case. It's safer this way. (BEAT) Do you want a flashlight? 
NIKKI (IRRITATED) No, that's okay. I'll be fine. 
She strides out of the living room. 
EXT. HOUSE - SAME as Nikki comes out the front door and heads off into the woods. 
NIKKI (MUTTERING) Shit. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Muffy sits quietly a moment, thinking. Then she gets up and goes toward the kitchen. 
INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALL - 
NIKKI Chaz, get up! ·Hurry, Chaz!... come on! 
He doesn't move. NIKKI Chaz, stop playing around! Get up!! 
She starts kicking him in the side. 
NIKKI Chaz! 
Chaz doesn't stir, but he does speak now without moving his lips. 
CHAZ (hissing, pretending to be dead) Will you quit kicking me? It hurts. 
NIKKI It's supposed to hurt! The game's over! Get up! 
CHAZ (still not moving) No. I'm dead. You're blowing the whole thing. Where's Muffy? 
NIKKI (SHRIEKING) Muffy IS dead!!! In the house!!! (WHIMPERING) Oh, God... 
CHAZ (sitting up suddenly) What? 
NIKKI (turning to the woods) Kit! Kit, come out! 
There is rustling O.S., then Kit starts to emerge. 
KIT What's going on? 
INT. STUDY - SAME 
Muffy is still lying face down as we saw her last. She hears footsteps going upstairs. 
INT. ATTIC - SAME 
Rob is creeping up the attic stairs when he hears footsteps o.s. too. He pauses, his face draining of color. EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT 
as Chaz, Nikki and Kit come racing up to the door and run inside. 
INT. STUDY - SAME 
as they come charging in... 
NIKKI She's gone! 
Nothing left, but the pool of blood and a thin trail of smeared drying blood to indicate that she's been dragged away. 
KIT What?... 
CHAZ Look, she's been dragged away. 
NIKKI (PANICKING) Chaz! somebody's still in this house! 
CHAZ We could follow the trail. 
KIT (DREAD) Oh, no... what about Rob? (HALF BEAT) Rob!! 
She races out of the study. 
INT. ATTIC - NIGHT 
The three of them come clambering up the stairs, Kit in the lead. They turn a corner. Then they see him... dead on the floor. 
KIT Rob...? 
They run over to him. 
KIT (dropping to her knees) Rob? Rob?? (shaking him: wailing) Rob!!! (dissolving into tears) It was only a game! CHAZ (SCARED SHITLESS) What the fuck is going on here?! 
NIKKI (POINTING) Chaz, look! 
Clutched in Rob's lifeless hand is a leather bookmark we may have noticed before. Chaz slips it out from beneath his fingers. 
CHAZ (DAZED) This was Nan's... 
NIKKI (TREMBLING) Nan... 
Suddenly there is a loud KNOCK beneath them O.S. They all look up. Someone is coming slowly up the stairs, the loud footsteps O.S.that could only be made by a heavy boot, thundering closer... and closer... 
Kit and Nikki and Chaz huddle around Rob's body and await their approaching doom. 
Suddenly a dark figure fills the doorframe at the top of the stairs. A hand with a knife is raised. ·Nikki screams. Chaz spies a lamp on the floor. He turns it on...

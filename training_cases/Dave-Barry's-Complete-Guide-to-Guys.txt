FADE IN: 
EXT. MIAMI - OCEAN AVE, SOUTH BEACH - DAY 
Blazing sun. MUSIC everywhere. Everybody's living la vida. 
LEOPOLD (V.0.) And we're good to go. TWO MEN come out of the BEACON HOTEL. Loud Hawaiian shirts, walking a Chihuahua. They pause; take in the scene on Ocean. Adjust their EARPIECES. 
LEOPOLD (V.0.) Proceed to first checkpoint and hold. They thread their way to the corner... across the street.. .onto the Promenade. Under fat shady palm trees, to a CLEARING -- 
CUT TO: 
EXT. THE ROOF OF THE BEACON HOTEL - CONTINUOUS 
AGENT STEARNS has a RIFLE with a kick-ass scope. AGENT LEOPOLD watches through binoculars; talks through a collar mike. 
LEOPOLD Okay sit tight. Company's coming. THROUGH BINOCULARS NOW, as TWO DEADLY MEN approach like barracudas. A THIRD GUY, BEHIND THEM, the KINGPIN they're protecting. Then as TREETOPS BLOCK THE VIEW -- 
LEOPOLD Shit. Hang on. Leopold scans, looking for them. Searching, until he FINDS -- 
LEOPOLD 
WHOA -- The Hawaiian Shirt Guys hear that. The SEE the Barracudas, getting nearer; steal a look at the roof... 
CUT TO: 
POV FROM ROOFTOP - THROUGH BINOCULARS - A FANTASTIC BLONDE rinses off at an outdoor shower. Beads of spray skip off her like diamonds in the sunlight. 
STEARNS Oh, mama. She bends, twists; water streams down every delicious curve. 
LEOPOLD She sure is taking her time... 
STEARNS She must be really salty... 
LEOPOLD (shakes his head) It's not just the salt. She's got sunscreen on. Then the sand gets on that, and it sticks... (then still watching) Hell, one time I was in Hawaii? And these three models -- 
STEARNS Wait a minute. (looks at him) Hawaii. 
LEOPOLD -- Shit! He WHIPS THE BINOCULARS back: but all that's left is the Chihuahua. Then, walking into the spot -- 
DAVE Hi, I'm Dave Barry. Has something like this ever happened to you? (bends down to pet 
THE CHIHUAHUA) Because if you're a guy - or if you know someone who is - then what you've just seen should look pretty familiar. He picks up the Chihuahua, starts walking with it. 
DAVE Scientists call this condition "Lust Induced Brain Freeze." It affects millions of guys, every day, in all walks of life -- causing anything from a mild embarrassment, to an international incident. He stops. Finds LEOPOLD and STEARNS and SEVERAL OTHER AGENTS pointing GUNS at him. 
LEOPOLD Hand over the dog. 
DAVE Hey. I didn't even know it was a dog. They take it from him; rush it away. Dave turns to CAMERA. 
DAVE 
(TO CAMERA) If that was you...you're a guy. 
CUT TO: 
INT. A DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT 
SHERYL CROW talks to the CAMERA before going onstage. The muffled SOUNDS of the warmup band O.S. 
SHERYL CROW Well there were always guys at my shows - right from the beginning. I mean you start out playing beer halls, right? So when you have beer, you have guys. And it sorta just grew from there. But I was okay with it. They didn't cause much trouble. 
DAVE (O.S.) And what about men. 
SHERYL CROW Men cause trouble. 
(THEN) But that's okay too. I get half my songs from that. 
DAVE (O.S.) So it all works out. 
SHERYL CROW Long as they buy the records... 
CUT TO: 
INT. MIAMI PUBLIC LIBRARY - DAY 
Dave walks along the stacks in the ANTHROPOLOGY SECTION. 
DAVE So where did this all start? Many experts now think they know where men came from, but what about Guys? where did they come from? He stops, peels off a THICK BOOK full of science things. 
DAVE To answer this question accurately, we might have to look something up. So instead we'll travel back to prehistoric sub-Saharan Africa, and get there just in time for the Dawn of Guys. 
CUT TO: 
TITLE CARD: "THE DAWN OF GUYS" 
CUT TO: 
EXT. PREHISTORIC AFRICA - MOONLIGHT 
The endless expanse. A cluster of caves. SOUND EFX of all kinds of nasty shit out there. Skittering over rocks. Slithering through the grasses. Bigger predators, circling... A ROOSTER cocks his head back and CROWS out. 
CUT TO: 
TNT. ONE OF THE CAVES PRIMATE ROGER opens one eye...SEES PRIMATE ELAINE, PRIMATE KIDS and PRIMATE IN-LAWS. Hairy grunting things, all sleeping in a protective clump... 
He rolls over, back to sleep. But the ROOSTER CROWS again... 
CUT TO: 
THE ROOSTER, COOKING ON AN OPEN FIRE 
CUT TO: 
EXT. THE CAVES - MORNING 
PRIMATE ROGER comes out. A sleepy nod at PRIMATE GENE and OTHER PRIMATES, as they take up LARGE JAGGED ROCK SLABS leaning against their caves and start off. In a few million years they'll be leaving suburban driveways this way. 
EXT. TRAIL FROM CAVE AREA - CAVES IN B.G. - MORNING 
PRIMATE ROGER and PRIMATE GENE have joined PRIMATE LENNY and PRIMATE PHIL. All carrying their slabs of jagged rocks. 
The PRIMATE WOMEN are still, pounding roots and tending fires and dealing with climbing PRIMATE KIDS. They HEAR SHOUTS O.S.; gather and go to the ridge where they SEE 
POV FROM RIDGE -- The PRIMATE GUYS are coming back, without their jagged slabs and without any animals. But they are having great fun: 
running in primitive patterns, and throwing one of the ROCKS back and forth and chasing whoever has it. It looks like the beginnings of rugby, or Australian Rules Football, in terms of all they need now is beer. The PRIMATE WOMEN watch. And trade looks. Once more, something seems to pass between them... 
CUT TO: 
INT. PRIMATE CAVE - NIGHT 
Primate Roger and Primate Elaine try to keep it down for the Primate Kids' sake. 
PRIMATE ELAINE (grunting, subtitled) Please don't tell me you got rid of your jagged rock slab. 
PRIMATE ROGER But these are great! 
PRIMATE ELAINE But you didn't kill anything. 
PRIMATE ROGER Nobody's going with jagged slabs anymore. 
PRIMATE ELAINE But the kids are hungry. 
PRIMATE ROGER What about your pounded roots? 
PRIMATE ELAINE Pounded roots are a side dish. They need balance in their diets. (then off his look) And another thing - suppose you do start bringing animals home using this -- who's going to skin and clean them? He looks at her-the SOUND of TOMORROW'S ROOSTER CROWING as 
CUT TO: 
EXT. THE CAVE - MORNING 
Primate Roger comes out of the cave, with his rock. He gives it such a look. 
Then looking up at the sky he hurls it, up as high as he can... 
AND THE CAMERA FOLLOWS THE ROCK, UP, UP, IN SLOW MOTION, 
PEAKING, THEN STARTING ITS DESCENT BACK TO EARTH -- ONLY NOW 
IT'S NOT A ROCK BUT A WINDOWS -- 
CUT TO: 
INT. ROGER AND ELAINE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
-- which ROGER is holding, across from ELAINE on the couch. 
ELAINE Five hundred dollars? 
ROGER It can hold a thousand addresses. 
ELAINE So can my address book. 
ROGER Can your address book pick up your em-ail? 
ELAINE No but my computer can. 
ROGER Well this can do both. 
ELAINE For five hundred dollars it should give me a manicure, Roger! It should drive me home from work at night! HOW could you spend that kind of money without discussing it first? On Roger's look...the PICTURE FREEZES. Dave walks in. 
DAVE There's a whole list of things a guy is supposed to discuss first. Unfortunately, he never knows what they are until he's already not discussed them. 
NEW FATHER GENE (looks, sees the toy 
STORE BOX) Oh I got that for Benjy. 
NEW MOTHER KELLY You were supposed to get a rattle. 
NEW FATHER GENE All the rattles were recalled. 
NEW MOTHER KELLY So you bought a tank. 
NEW FATHER GENE Wait'll you see what this can do, baby. Benjy's gonna love it. 
NEW MOTHER KELLY Oh yeah? Can he shake it? Will it rattle? 
NEW FATHER GENE Rattle? This thing'll bring down a bookshelf! She looks at him. He'll be returning the thing within seconds. CAMERA PANS to Dave, who shrugs. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. DETROIT - ED'S AUTO SHOP - DAY 
A rundown place with junked cars out front. ED's an intense little guy in a Tigers' hat and a couple major tattoos. 
ED Well I'm into fireworks. I like to take 'em apart, you know. And study 'em. See what makes 'em tick. 
He shows Dave a box with ASSORTED FIREWORKS inside. 
ED I just got these from Ohio. I don't think they're as good as the ones I got from Tennessee. Not as loud, you know? 
DAVE Well no, if loud is your -- 
ED If you want to hear loud - listen to this. He goes over to a different box, takes out what looks like a stick of dynamite. Gets ready to light it; turns to CAMERA. 
ED You may want to step back a couple hundred yards. 
CUT TO: 
INT. DAVE'S CAR - TRAVELING - DAY 
As Ed's Auto Shop recedes in the background - with a LOUD EXPLOSION accompanying - 
DAVE So when we see guys like Ed, and his fireworks - or guys shooting marine flares into innocent pumpkins, or building catapults that'll throw a Buick - we should not condemn them. We should not assume these are just pointless juvenile activities. Instead we should be convinced they are, and move on to Guys in the Workplace. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. CITY STREET - PHILADELPHIA - DAY 
A PHILADELPHIA GIRL stands outside a CHEESESTEAK PLACE. 
PHILADELPHIA GIRL Guys at work? Or guys doing work. 
(MORE) 
PHILADELPHIA GIRL (CONT'D) I mean unless you want to talk about faxing or emailing their stupid jokes back and forth. Sick jokes. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. WALL STREET - DAY 
Dave and a SEASONED BROKER eat HOT DOGS from a CORNER CART. 
BROKER Ten, fifteen years ago? A guy would call you up with some joke he just heard. So you wanna pass it on, it's by phone. One person at a time. Then a while later, some guy calls you up with the same exact joke. Then when group faxing came in, it really sped things up. Next thing you know there's like ten faxes on your machine, from places you never even heard of. Places around the world, I'm saying. 
ELAINE I'm just saying. I don't see the four of you fighting over who can write the better sonnet. 
ROGER So? 
ELAINE So no one gets hurt writing sonnets. 
ROGER (off her look; then) It's a sprain. 
BACK TO: 
INT. THE NEWSPAPER BUILDING - DAY 
Roger listens more agitated as the argument mounts. 
GENE When did you last run the forty? 
PATRICK Hey. I could beat you in the forty running backwards. 
TOM You couldn't even beat your butt running backwards. 
ROGER (from his desk) Will you guys cut it out? They stop. Look at him. 
ROGER The kid in the story's in high school. You're not. You're supposed to be adults and you're bragging about who can beat who in a stupid footrace. 
TOM No one's bragging. 
PATRICK Gene's just saying he can run the forty in under six seconds. 
ROGER Hey. I can do it in under six seconds. FREEZE THE PICTURE, on their expressions. BRING UP "CHARIOTS 
OF FIRE" MUSIC 
DISSOLVE T0: 
EXT. CITY PARK - DAY 
The FOUR GUYS crouch in their starting stance. A SECRETARY stands at the end of a marked-off course with a stopwatch and a whistle. She blows the whistle. They're off. 
SLOW MOTION WITH MUSIC All four guys explode off the line. Patrick gets five strides and goes down. Tom gets two more and falls, howling in pain. Then Gene and Roger, neck and neck for at least three more strides until Roger HEARS A "POP," that ECHOES over the music, and goes toppling down. As Gene finishes alone - gripping his side in awful pain but pumping his fist in victory. 
MUSIC FADES AS 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. ELAINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Elaine comes in; Roger, limping and leaning heavily on her. 
ELAINE I don't know why I listened to you. You need to see a doctor. 
ROGER It's a sprain, Elaine. 
ELAINE Roger you can't walk. 
ROGER It'll work itself out. She gives him a look. Parks him long enough to close the door behind him. Without her support, he drops to the floor. She turns to the CAMERA. 
ELAINE Why won't they go to the doctor? 
CUT TO: 
INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY 
(THEN) She could think we were being cheap. 
ELAINE And how would she feel about that... 
CUT TO: 
INT. THE DEN - SAME 
Roger and Gene watch a PORSCHE COMMERCIAL without the sound. 
GENE That one has the GPS. With the screen that has maps of everything? 
ROGER What about with the convertible. 
GENE It's optional on the convertible. Unless you get the turbo, then it's standard. 
ROGER Phil Wonkerman got the turbo. 
GENE No shit...Phil got a Porsche? 
ROGER Said it was his birthday present to himself. 
GENE 
(IMPRESSED; THEN) When was his birthday. 
ROGER Beats me. Probably around the same time when he got the car. 
GENE No shit... 
(THEN) Maybe we should get him something. 
ROGER (looks at him) He just got a Porsche. 
GENE Right. They look at the TV again. Then, from the kitchen doorway: 
ELAINE Roger? They turn. Elaine gives Roger a look. PICTURE FREEZES AS: 
DAVE Roger met Elaine at a company event. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. A HOTEL POOL - DAY 
PEOPLE with NAMETAGS mingle with drinks and appetizers. Dave comes away from the hot buffet table with a great haul. 
DAVE -- They discovered they had something in common right away. He points to ROGER and ELAINE, over by a tiki-torch. 
ELAINE You're kidding! That was you? At the Burger King? 
ROGER I was in fourth grade. 
ELAINE I was too! But my God, you remembered that? 
DAVE (off Roger's nod) She loved that he remembered that. 
CUT TO: 
INT. A BOWLING ALLEY - NIGHT 
A GLOW-BOWL night; neon and black light and MUSIC. 
ROGER'S INNER VOICE And I'm gonna have them look at the transmission again. I don't care what those morons say, it's still not shifting right. And they better not try to blame it on the cold weather this time. What cold weather? It's eighty-seven degrees out, and this thing is shifting like a goddam garbage truck, and I paid those incompetent lowlife bastards six hundred dollars. 
CAMERA PANS TO ELAINE. 
ELAINE'S INNER VOICE -- He's angry. And I don't blame him. I'd be angry too. God, I feel so guilty, putting him through this, but I can't help the way I feel. I'm just not sure. 
ELAINE'S OVAL IMAGE 
(TO ELAINE) You know what your problem is? You're too idealistic. You're waiting for some knight to come riding up on his white horse, when you're sitting next to a perfectly good person, a person you enjoy being with, a person you truly do care about, a person who seems to truly care about you. A person who is in pain because of this self-centered, schoolgirl fantasy that you insist on clinging to. CAMERA PANS TO ROGER. His OVAL IMAGE APPEARS; at the LOCAL BAR with a beer in front of him and pool tables in b.g. 
ROGER'S INNER VOICE They'll probably say it's only a ninety day warranty. That's exactly what they're gonna say, the scumballs. 
ROGER'S OVAL IMAGE Let 'em say what they want. You don't have to listen. 
ELAINE Roger? 
ROGER'S INNER VOICE You know you're right. They want a warranty? I'll give them a goddam warranty. I'll take their lousy warranty and stick it right up their -- 
ELAINE Roger. 
ROGER 
(STARTLED) -- What? 
ELAINE Please don't torture yourself like this. Maybe I should never have... 
(BREAKING DOWN) Oh God, I feel so... 
ROGER (looks over, alarmed) 
WHAT -- She struggles to keep control. Her OVAL IMAGE disapproves. 
ELAINE I'm such a fool. I mean I know there's no knight. I really know that. It's silly. There's no knight, and there's no horse. 
ROGER There's no horse? He looks up; his OVAL IMAGE SHRUGS; gets up off the stool. 
ELAINE You think I'm a fool, don't you? 
ROGER (reacting to the Oval 
ROGER) -- no! He looks over at her; not sure who he responded to...but it appears he said the right thing anyway. 
ELAINE It's just.. .well I need ...time, I think. I think I need some time. Roger looks up at his OVAL IMAGE: gone. He looks at Elaine. 
ROGER -- Time. Yes. 
ELAINE (moved, touches his 
HAND) Oh Roger, do you really feel that way? 
ROGER What way? 
ELAINE About time. Do you feel that way about time? Roger looks confused. His OVAL IMAGE is off playing pool now. He turns to Elaine; does his best to look decisive. 
ROGER Oh. Well. Yes. Yes I do, feel that way. About time. 
ELAINE 
(MELTS) Thank you, Roger. 
ROGER -- Thank you. They smile. Look forward. He looks a little nervous. She looks serene... 
Roger and Gene get ready for some 1 on 1. Roger passes to Gene... 
ROGER Check. .who passes it right back. 
GENE Check. 
Roger takes the ball, dribbles, almost starts but doesn't. Gene looks at him. 
ROGER Listen. 
GENE What. 
ROGER (a beat; then) -- Elaine and I. 
GENE Elaine and you what. 
ROGER (a beat; then he shrugs) We sort of have this -- thing. He looks at Gene. Conveys the full impact of this. Then -- 
ROGER Did she ever mention owning a horse? 
GENE Who. 
ROGER Elaine. She ever talk about horses? Like, to Kelly or something? 
GENE Not that I know of. Why? Roger thinks.. .then shakes it off. Throws the ball to Gene. 
ROGER What's the score. 
GENE We haven't started yet. They start to play. CAMERA FINDS DAVE, on a nearby bench. 
DAVE Roger's in love. 
CUT TO: 
INT. RECORDING STUDIO - DAY 
SHERYL CROW takes a break in the MIXING BOOTH. 
SHERYL CROW I can sympathize with your friend, man. I've seen a lot of guys go there. 
DAVE Do you have any advice for a guy in love? 
SHERYL CROW I don't know - most of my songs are about guys out of love. 
DAVE I see. 
SHERYL CROW Cause you know, a guy in love - a guy who's where your friend's at, anyway - they don't know where they are. They're like an ant, standing on a truck tire. They don't know how they got there - all they know is that's not where they were a minute ago. But then they sort of get vaguely okay with it, you know? They start hangin' out there, they're feelin' pretty good. 
(THEN) Until the thing starts moving. 
DAVE What happens then. 
SHERYL CROW Well then they get crushed. Dave gulps. She shrugs. 
SHERYL CROW Rock and roll, my friend. Life in the city. 
CUT TO: 
INT. TWO OLD PEOPLE ON A COUCH - DAY 
OLD MAN November 8, 1960. The day John Kennedy beat Nixon and won the White House. That was the day I met her. His WIFE turns, looks at him funny. 
A JERSEY GIRL on break at a SNACK HUT. 
JERSEY GIRL What I don't get is how they can be a fully grown adult male and not be able to make a commitment to a woman who loves him like no one else - and yet the same person, at age seven, could make an unbreakable lifelong commitment to the San Francisco Giants, who do not even know him and who never will. (shakes her head) I just don't get it. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SEATTLE - E-CAFE - DAY 
A SEATTLE GIRL outside the cafe. 
SEATTLE GIRL They're never "ready." If you ask me, guys are in a permanent state of nonreadiness. That's where they live. If guys were turkey breasts, you could put one in a 350 degree oven on the Fourth of July and they still wouldn't be ready in time for Thanksgiving. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. CHICAGO - RARE BOOKS STORE - DAY 
The OWNER arranges titles on a display outside her store. 
CHICAGO GIRL The thing is, you shouldn't even think about marrying them until you really know them. But you can't really know them until you marry them. (then after a beat) That's the thing. 
CUT TO: 
TITLE CARD: "GUY FIDELITY" 
EXT. MANHATTAN - DAY 
A Manhattan Girl gives a world-weary look. 
MANHATTAN GIRL One: A guy will have sex with anything. Two: A guy will do anything to have sex. There's your Guy Fidelity. Move on. 
CUT TO: 
TITLE CARD: "GUY PRIDE" 
INT. ROGER AND ELAINE'S MARRIED HOUSE - DAY 
Elaine and Roger are inside, looking at the front door. 
ELAINE What do you mean, it's 'supposed to be that way.' It's stuck. 
ROGER It's basic physics, Elaine. Wood expands. And then, later, it contracts. 
ELAINE But we can't get out. 
ROGER Which also means other people can't get in. That's part of the design - it discourages burglars. 
ELAINE (looks at him) The same way the toaster was designed to discourage carbohydrate consumption by bursting into flames? 
ROGER That was an outdoor toaster. It was clearly not designed for indoor situations. The PICTURE FREEZES. DAVE steps in front, talks to CAMERA. 
DAVE I think it's obvious here, that Roger has absolutely no idea what he's talking about. But Guy Pride forces him to keep acting like he does know, for reasons I believe we've covered in an earlier scene. He nods his head over to the corner, where the CAMERA PANS TO SEE HUDDLED VISIGOTHS, WAITING. Then BACK TO ROGER AND ELAINE as the PICTURE UNFREEZES. 
ELAINE Okay. So now we have a broken water heater and a stuck front door. 
(CONTROLS HERSELF; 
THEN) I think it's time to call Steve. ELAINE'S IMAGE FREEZES. Roger turns to the CAMERA. 
ROGER "Steve." 
CUT TO: 
ELAINE 
(SOLIDARITY NOD) Then we have to call Steve. And they get offended. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HARDWARE STORE - DAY 
Roger waits at the counter. Talks to CAMERA. 
ROGER Let me tell you something. If I had a dollar for every time I heard "Steve's" name, I could hire somebody better than Steve, just to shake things up. Get her one of these old semi-retired guys - someone from the pre-steroid days, with the hairy shoulders, and the butt crack. They won't be so quick to call him every ten minutes. The Clerk comes back. Hands over a 53-piece TOOL SET. 
CLERK Remember. Keep these away from anything magnetic. 
ROGER 
(WINKS) Got it. He takes the tool kit from the Clerk and drops it. The Clerk watches Roger chase down all the parts: what a dolt. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY 
Roger puts the tool set in his trunk...then stops. 
ROGER The thing is - I missed out. (turns to CAMERA) It's like everyone else was there the day they taught all this stuff. How to look inside acar.Or a furnace. Or a rocketship.But the guys like Steve, youknow.They were born knowing allthis- and now they're laughing. 
(MORE) 
ROGER (CONT'D) They all go down to the Competent Guys' Tavern and compare notes. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. COMPETENT GUYS' TAVERN - DAY 
VANS and PICKUP TRUCKS just like Steve's are parked outside. A STEVE LOOKALIKE gets out and goes in, greeting ANOTHER STEVE also arriving. LAUGHTER pours out from inside. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. ROGER AND ELAINE'S HOUSE - DAY 
Steve rings the bell. Elaine tries opening the door. 
ELAINE (on other side) I'm sorry - the door's stuck. 
STEVE I can fix that. He checks it out, taps it in one place and opens the door. Elaine steps aside, enchanted -- -- as Roger drives up and sees this. And the pain in his heart is something we can feel. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ROGER AND ELAINE'S BASEMENT - DAY 
Power's back on. Steve pulls the cover off the HVAC assembly. Roger is sorting through the 53-piece tool set he bought and has no idea what to do with. 
STEVE If you've got a minute, sir. I'd like to show you something. 
ROGER (holds up tool kit) Should I bring these? 
STEVE That won't be -- (then as all the parts 
FALL OUT) -- necessary. 
ROGER 
MIKE THE MOOSE Three months ago, the Marlins traded a guy named Rufino Lupenza to the Yankees, for some minor league players and cash. I grant you it was a rotten trade. I grant you the Yankees seem to have this, this knack for making brilliant deals year after year. But three months? (pops in a tape) The Marlins are over it. The Yankees are over it. The players and their families are over it -- but just check this out. 
CALLER 
(ON TAPE) The guy was a workhorse! He filled in wherever he was needed and he never got hurt! And when he got hurt, he played hurt. 
MIKE THE MOOSE 
(ON TAPE) You know I got a post card from him here at the station. He says they're all doing fine: Lucita's got the kids in their new school already and they all seem happy. She even found an Ecuadorean grocery she likes. 
CALLER Grocery -- the guy batted 340, from both sides. 
(MORE) 
CALLER (CONT'D) His on-base percentage was in the 4's, with a rocket arm on defense and an awareness of the field like nobody's business. And they trade him for minor leaguers? For untested, greenhorn punks who can barely even -- 
MIKE THE MOOSE (pauses the tape) That guy's pretty normal. He cues forward, plays. A GUY CALLER, fighting tears. 
MIKE THE MOOSE 
(ON RADIO) You just have to move on, Stan. 
CALLER .I try to - I'm trying. But I just can't make sense of this... Mike the Moose stops the tape. 
MIKE THE MOOSE These are guys you wouldn't see crying even at a funeral. Guys who can't bring themselves to hug their own children. And they're beside themselves. (shakes his head) And all over a meaningless trade... 
DAVE Meaningless? Mike the Moose looks at him. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ROGER AND ELAINE'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Roger and Gene are watching the KNICKS/HEAT game. Big bag of Doritos between them. 
TV ANNOUNCER .seventy-seven per cent from the line during the regular season, and a red-hot eighty-three per cent during the playoffs. 
ROGER Stop saying that! 
TV ANNOUNCER SIDEKICK -- and in the fourth quarter of the playoffs, that number is even higher -- 
GENE Stop saying that! 
TV ANNOUNCER So they really picked the wrong guy to foul, at this crucial point in such a crucial game. 
ROGER AND GENE Stop saying that! 
TV ANNOUNCER He dribbles. He sets -- he dribbles again... Roger and Gene lean forward. 
ROGER Come on come on come on comeoncomeon -- 
GENE Miss the shot miss the shot miss the shot come on and miss the shot -- 
TV ANNOUNCER -- and the Knicks call time out. They lean back in their seats; breathe some relief. 
CUT TO: 
INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 
Elaine and Kelly are addressing INVITATIONS by hand. Dave sits on the counter, listens in. 
ELAINE They don't know the players. The players don't know them - yet they idolize these people. They follow them from team to team -- and they know more about these teams than they know about their own families. They might not even know if they have families. 
KELLY I'm with you. They turn, go back to the kitchen. The celebration goes on. 
CUT TO: 
TITLE CARD: "THE PUBLIC REST ROOM PROBLEM" 
INT. MIAMI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY 
Dave walks down a terminal corridor among hurrying PASSENGERS. 
DAVE If there's one thing women don't know about when it comes to guys, it's the public rest room problem. And we're here to clear that up right now. He stops outside a MEN'S REST ROOM, which is currently closed for maintenance. 
DAVE This room is a private hell for a countless number of guys -- yet the women in their lives are completely in the dark about it. 
(MORE) 
DAVE (CONT'D) But before we go inside, let's talk with a leading social scientist, so that what we're about to show you sounds a little more official. 
CUT TO: 
INT. RED CARPET CLUB - DAY 
Dave is at the honor bar with the SAME BRITISH GUY. The words "Leading Social Scientist" APPEAR under him this time. 
LEADING SOCIAL SCIENTIST One has to understand that the act of emptying one's bladder goes deep to the very roots of masculinity. It is an important territorial statement that males are genetically programmed to carry out. 
DAVE I see. 
LEADING SOCIAL SCIENTIST In fact, many of my colleagues believe the reason that dogs howl at the moon is because they can't go up there and urinate on it -- which is not, however, a theory which I embrace. But guess who gets all the grant money every year. The bastards... He stares off into space. A bitter man. 
DAVE Um...you were saying? 
LEADING SOCIAL SCIENTIST I didn't want this job. Twenty years, in the social sciences? And what was everybody else doing -- they were getting laid. They were going to bed with women. And what have I been doing -- applying for matching grants. And not getting them. 
(MORE) 
LEADING SOCIAL SCIENTIST (CONT'D) Applying for any grants at all - and not getting those either. Meanwhile all the "cool dudes" are laughing! 
CUT TO: 
EXT. "THE COOL DUDES WHO GET THE BIG GRANTS" TAVERN - DAY 
Honda Accords fill the lot. TWO MORE drive up and a SCIENTIST gets out of each. They hail each other and go in together. As they pull open the door, LAUGHTER spills out from inside. 
LEADING SOCIAL SCIENTIST (V.0.) The bastards... 
CUT TO: 
TITLE CARD: "THE PUBLIC REST ROOM PROBLEM" 
EXT. A VIDEO PRODUCTION TRUCK - DAY 
There is a SATELLITE DISH on top. Dave is with JOHN MADDEN. 
DAVE With me now is the great John Madden -- legendary coach of football's Oakland Raiders and veteran network analyst for CBS Sports and now the Fox Sports Network. John, thanks for coming by today. 
JOHN MADDEN Happy to be here Dave. 
DAVE John, you heard what our leading expert said about this particular anxiety that guys have regarding bathrooms in general and public ones in particular. Any thoughts? 
JOHN MADDEN Well he's exactly right, Dave. I mean the guy was a little loopy but he hit the nail on the head. 
DAVE (V.O.) We did that. 
CUT TO: 
TITLE CARD: "GUYS AT MIDLIFE" 
EXT. UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI - DAY 
Dave walks the campus. Threads through GORGEOUS COLLEGE GIRLS who don't know he's there. 
DAVE If there's anything that causes more anguish in a guy than sports anguish, and public restroom anguish, and hardware store anguish, it's the day that he realizes that somehow his life is half over now, and no matter what he tries to tell himself, he's not young anymore and he's never going to be young again. (then he stops) And as any guy'll tell you - it sucks. 
CUT TO: 
INT. AN ELEVATOR - DAY 
A GUY IN A SUIT, alone in here. Faint ELEVATOR MUSIC plays. 
ELEVATOR GUY I got used to having the Beatles and Stones called 'classic rock.' Then I heard Elvis Costello on an Oldies station. I figured, okay - who cares - at least it's on somewhere. But then I hear "London Calling," on Muzak. By the Clash. On Muzak. 
(SHRUGS) But what the hell. I'm in a suit and I go around all day explaining peoples' 401K plans to them. And Sting's doing commercials for Jaguar. He shakes his head; it's hopeless. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SHOPPING MALL BARBER SHOP - DAY 
The BARBER talks while cutting Dave's hair. 
BARBER The way I see it, it's like menopause, right? Except men get it different. It doesn't show, y'see? The cramps don't come, the hot and cold flashes, and you don't have your magazines and drug stores filled with helpful stuff to do about it. But something comes, and it hits every guy who's living whether he likes it or not. Whether he knows it or not. Guy can lose his bleepin' mind if he doesn't watch out. He gets a mirror to show Dave the back. Gives him time to get philosophical. 
BARBER But you know? Maybe it's for the better. Maybe whoever designed all this, was afraid to let the men in on what was gonna be happening. Like if we knew, we'd bail or something. You know, ahead of time. 
CUT TO: 
INT. A BAR - DAY 
The BARTENDER wipes the bar down in front of Dave. 
BARTENDER I'm just telling you what I see. Every lousy day. A guy'll come in and sit down, right where you are. He loosens up a little and then it comes. The road not taken. Unexamined choices. An unfulfilled life. And other guys, they'll come in and don't say a word. The ones who just stare at the mirror. 
DAVE That sounds pretty bleak. 
BARTENDER 
(SHRUGS; THEN) I think it goes back to the old times. Ancient times, you know? When nobody was expected to live past forty. You got to forty? You died. 
(MORE) 
BARTENDER (CONT'D) But now that men aren't doing that, there's a lot more shit up ahead, and none of it looks good so they go freak out and make a mess of things -- they'll quit their jobs or walk out on their marriages or make some other idiot grandstand move. None of them are happy and every single one of them wishes he did something else with his life and can't figure out how it got this way. Every single one of them. 
CUT TO: 
INT. LAWYER'S OFFICE - DAY 
A hotshot LAWYER is dictating a memo to his SECRETARY. 
LAWYER .therefore please be advised that in reference to the aforementioned subject matter, as per the original agreement dated 7 March Two Thousand, -- His Secretary stops writing. Waits. 
LAWYER ...7 March Two Thousand... 
SECRETARY Um. You said that already. 
JOHNNY LAKE Yeah right. Driving around in a rusted worthless pickup truck that's about to be repossessed anyway, while a guy like you, my own age, is going around in a Porsche Carrera. 
LAWYER But you get to fly. 
JOHNNY LAKE No, you get to fly. I get to hoof this shit up and down these godforsaken hilltops listening to stockbrokers brag about getting lap dances from college coeds, and charging the whole thing through the company expense account -- while I can't even deduct my blood pressure medication. That's what I get to do. He kicks a rock in the road, which almost feels good enough so he kicks another one -- but this one is buried in the dirt like an iceberg and doesn't budge -- 
JOHNNY LAKE Ahh, SHIT! -- and he falls down hobbling on one knee instead. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON'S OFFICE - DAY 
Johnny Lake waits on the examining table, holding ice against his leg. The Lawyer sits on the extra chair reading EXOTIC 
ISLANDS MAGAZINE. 
He holds up a PHOTO: a Guy in a hammock, in Paradise. 
LAWYER Look at this. 
JOHNNY LAKE You got that right. The Lawyer shakes his head; flips the page. 
JOHNNY LAKE Hey. (then on Lawyer's look; he shrugs) You don't think he's gonna... 
LAWYER What. 
JOHNNY LAKE You know. Have to use the -- 
LAWYER Glove? (then off his look) You hurt your knee. He already took the x-rays. 
JOHNNY LAKE What if something's broken. 
LAWYER Well he's not going in that way. You don't do a rectal to set a guy's leg. Still the guy looks doubtful. The ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON - British, familiar - comes in, with a fresh X-RAY. 
ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON Well you've done quite a number on yourself. Want to see? 
JOHNNY LAKE Why should I. I wouldn't know what the hell I'm looking at. You're the one who went to medical school. 
ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON Don't remind me. (then on their looks) What. You think I like this? 
(MORE) 
ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON (CONT'D) The medical profession? Owing my life to the insurance cartel while the rest of the world thinks I'm so stinking rich? 
LAWYER Well.. .aren't you? 
ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON Of courseIam - I'm an orthopedic surgeon!Ijust don't like people assumingit! 
(THENASHIS BEEPER 
GOESOFF) And this -- I am so sick of this bloody thing I can't even tell you! Because every time it goes off it means I have to stop doing one thing I don't want to be doing, and start doing another thing I don't want to be doing. You call that a life? They look at him. Don't know what to say. 
ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON -- Let me show you something. (puts down the x-ray, goes to a drawer) I've been working on this during my free time. Not like I get any. He gets an accordion-style envelope; takes out a REAM OF TYPED PAGES. Hands it over to Johnny Lake. 
JOHNNY LAKE What is it? 
ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON What is it? It's a screenplay! This'll blow the lid off the orthopedic surgery industry! Look - look here -- (takes it back; flips 
THROUGH) -- no wait, this part's better. No -- here! Here you go. Read this and tell me if you don't -- 
He looks up. They're gone. 
DAVE (CONT'D) In fact, when modern women describe the qualities they're looking for in the ideal man, the phrase "a real fast shooter" is usually pretty far down the list. 
(THEN STOPPING) Naturally, it fell to guys to do something about this. So, naturally - they did. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. A SKI CABIN - NIGHT 
Dave stands outside while Kelly and Gene come back from walking their dog. In a hurry. 
DAVE one technique for holding back the inevitable, is when the guy - just when he is about to have his euphemism - will hurl himself violently into an iron bed railing, and raise a lump on his head the size of a golf ball. 
CUT TO: 
INT. THE SKI CABIN - CONTINUOUS 
They come in the room, shedding clothes. He lifts her, carries her to the bed -- with nothing but pillows against the wall. He stops, panicked... 
GENE There's nothing there! 
CUT TO: 
EXT. THE CABIN - CONTINUOUS 
Dave watches the LIGHT GO OFF. Turns back to the CAMERA. 
DAVE In cases where there aren't any iron railings, a good backup technique can be found right on the end of the cold wet nose of the trusted family dog. CAMERA PANS to the window where we hear: 
KELLY Yes...yes... 
GENE .yesyesyesyes...yesyesyesyes... 
KELLY .just hold on...yes... 
GENE .yesyesyesyesYEEE00000WWWW!!! CAMERA PANS back to Dave. 
DAVE There are also mental techniques -- 
CUT TO: 
INT. ROGER AND ELAINE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Roger and Elaine are under the sheets. Some good early MOANING.. .as Dave comes in, holding a mike, interview style. 
DAVE One of the most time honored and reliable mental delaying styles, is the Baseball Method -- (taps Roger's shoulder) -- how's it going, Champ. Roger pokes his head out of the blanket; stays active from the neck down. 
ROGER Oh - yeah hi. 
(ACKNOWLEDGES CAMERA; then to Dave) Well, the baseball thing. I mean a while ago I was into that - big time. You know, fooling around with different lineups, mixing up the batting order - like thinking about what would happen if you took your cleanup guy and made him eighth or something -- just something stupid like that, you know? Stuff you'd never really do. 
DAVE And that did the trick. 
ROGER Oh hell yeah. I mean I could go all night - literally all night - just shuffling my pitching staff around, or thinking about who I might try and sign at the winter meetings. Hang on -- He goes under the blanket; pays more attention to Elaine... then comes back. 
ROGER The thing is, it got stale. And I found after a while I wasn't enjoying sex or baseball that much. And you don't want to mess with that stuff. 
DAVE 
(CAN'T DISAGREE) So what do you do instead? 
ROGER Math problems. 
PRIMATE BLONDE WOMAN (off their laughter) I like the smell. 
PRIMATE LUCY Of the men, or the rotten fish? 
PRIMATE KELLY There's a difference? More laughing; then they turn back to Primate Elaine. 
PRIMATE KELLY But how will we make them go along? Most of them can't even remember which cave to come home to every night. How are they going to remember rules? 
PRIMATE ELAINE We'll give them a Look. 
PRIMATE LUCY A look? 
PRIMATE ELAINE A special look. A 'Certain Look.' 
PRIMATE KELLY But we look at them every day. And they still do whatever they want. 
PRIMATE ELAINE (as the others agree) I've been working on this. Watch. She turns to Primate Blonde Woman, who is holding a gourd. On the Look, the Blonde drops the gourd. 
PRIMATE ELAINE See? And she wasn't even doing anything. Agreements and "Wows" go all around. 
PRIMATE ELAINE Now who's with me. 
CUT TO: 
VARIOUS SHOTS, QUICK CUTS OF THE PRIMATE WOMEN TRYING TO GET 
THE "LOOK" RIGHT. EVENTUALLY, EVEN PRIMATE BLONDE WOMAN 
GETS IT. . .ALTHOUGH AT ONE POINT SHE SCARES HERSELF AND DROPS 
THE GOURD AGAIN. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. TRAIL BACK TO THE CAVES - DUSK 
The Primate Guys come back lugging ANIMAL PARTS. Each now has his own ROCK, instead of the giant jagged slabs. 
PRIMATE GENE What are you doing later. 
PRIMATE ROGER I don't know. Probably just stare at the fire. 
PRIMATE GENE A bunch of us are going over to Primate Blonde Woman's cave to see what she does with those gourds. Want to come? 
PRIMATE ROGER -- Can't. Primate Elaine's ancestors are still here. 
PRIMATE GENE Bummer. 
PRIMATE ROGER Tell me about it. 
(THEN) They are so Ice Age... 
CUT TO: 
INT. PRIMATE ROGER AND PRIMATE ELAINE'S CAVE - NIGHT 
Primate Roger watches Primate Elaine examine his NEW ROCK. Her PRIMATE MOM AND DAD hover on the edge of the discussion. 
PRIMATE ELAINE I don't get it. What was wrong with the other one. 
PRIMATE ROGER This one's better. It's an upgrade. 
CUT TO: 
INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY 
Dave goes up the escalator; walks through the kind of 'Home Stylings' section where no other guy would go. Everything he talks about is on display in some form. 
DAVE -- And there are thousands of standards for domestic life, involving even more totally un-guy concepts -- like curtains, bedspreads, napkins, special hangers, little soaps shaped like fruit, and decorative boxes that hold tissues that already come in a box. While guys, left on their own in the wild, will develop lifestyles that don't involve any of these things. 
CUT TO: 
INT. COLLEGE GUY APARTMENT - DAY 
COLLEGE ROGER and COLLEGE GENE stand in their doorway. There is one window, a lot of dust and nothing else. 
COLLEGE GENE I know just what this place needs. 
COLLEGE ROGER 
(NODS) Hockey sticks. They turn around to go buy hockey sticks. 
CUT TO: 
INT. THE SAME APARTMENT - SOME MONTHS LATER 
A RABBIT on a lawn chair drinks beer out of an ashtray. College Roger and College Gene play Indoor Death Hockey; slamming into walls, scattering NEWSPAPERS and PIZZA BOXES - as their IMAGE FREEZES. 
DAVE of course, even by the most basic standards, these two are living like savages. But they honestly don't know this -- because Guys, in their natural state, aren't any more aware of domestic standards than a trout would be aware of the stock market. And this causes women a lot of concern. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SEATTLE - E-CAFE - DAY 
SEATTLE GIRL Take laundry. To him his clean clothes are ready when he's ready to go get them. And they can dry the rest of the way in the drawer. But they don't dry the rest of the way in the drawer, they sit there in damp musty unfolded balls and he doesn't even mind, and I can't figure that out. What is the matter with folding something? What is the matter with waiting for it to be dry? 
CUT TO: 
INT. DAVE'S CURRENT BEDROOM - DAY 
Dave unloads a laundry basket on the bed. Starts folding the clean clothes and making piles. 
DAVE Laundry's a big issue - and a deep and puzzling mystery to guys. My own wife Michelle, for instance, is an accomplished sportswriter and mother of an extremely young child, yet she is still able to maintain a vigorous clothes-cleaning regimen bordering on the super-human. And I'm not allowed near the stuff. 
MICHELLE (comes in with more 
CLOTHES) He's right. She dumps out the clothes, sees what he's doing and takes over, doing it better. Dave picks up a random BLOUSE, shows a LABEL with lots of printing on it. 
DAVE These are clearly secret codes, that women intuitively understand but cannot adequately explain -- just like how a lot of guys understand the Infield Fly Rule, without being able to explain that. 
MICHELLE I can explain the Infield Fly Rule. 
DAVE Because you're special, Sweetheart. 
CUT TO: 
TITLE CARD: "GUY BASHING" 
EXT. OUTDOOR CAFE - DAY 
Dave anchors a semi circle with Sidra, Mia, Karla E and Lila. They take turns focus group style. 
SIDRA Sometimes I think they're just like tapeworms. You know? I mean tapeworms are just tapeworms - that's all they are, and all they'll ever be. They're just these repulsive little parasitic beasts and nobody expects anything different from them - because people know that's their nature. And it's the same way with guys - although a tapeworm's more likely to help clean out the garage.

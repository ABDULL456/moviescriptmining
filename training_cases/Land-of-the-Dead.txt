BLACK. THE SOUND OF CHANNELS BEING TURNED ON A TV. TITLE UP: 
"SOME TIME AGO". 
NEWSCASTER (O.S.) 
It's hard for us here to believe what we're reporting to you, but it does seem to be a fact. CLICK! In a corner of the BLACK SCREEN, A SMALL TV APPEARS. On it, in BLACK & WHITE, A NEWSCASTER sits at an anchor desk. 
NEWSCASTER (O.S.) 
Bodies of the recently dead are returning to life and attacking the living. CLICK! With each CLICK, the TV disappears, then reappears in a new position ON SCREEN. CREDITS ROLL in the surrounding 
BLACK. 
NEWSCASTER (O.S.) 
Murder victims have shown signs of having been partially devoured by their murderers. CLICK! ANOTHER NEWSCASTER is on the TV now, sitting in a more modern studio. The broadcast remains in BLACK & WHITE. 
SECOND NEWSCASTER 
Because of the obvious threat to 
untold numbers of citizens, due to the crisis that is now developing this radio station will 
remain on the air day and night. 
CLICK! The second newscaster looks more and more dishevelled. 
SECOND NEWSCASTER (O.S.) 
It has been established that persons who have recently died have been returning to life and eating the flesh of the living. 
CLICK! 
SECOND NEWSCASTER (O.S.) 
We must not be lulled by the concept that these are our family members or our friends. They are not. They must be destroyed on sight. CLICK! A THIRD NEWSCASTER, more haggard than the others, sits at an ANCHOR DESK on a barren set, still in BLACK & WHITE. 
THIRD NEWSCASTER (O.S.) 
Every dead body that is not exterminated becomes one of them. It gets up and kills. The people it kills get up and kill. They kill for one reason. They kill for food. 
CLICK! 
THIRD NEWSCASTER (O.S.) 
If this situation is allowed to continue, there will be nothing left. Nothing. 
CLICK! 
THIRD NEWSCASTER (CONT'D) 
It's over. Finished. Finished. It's their world now. 
CLICK! IN ABSOLUTE BLACK, A SINGLE WORD FADES UP: "TODAY". A 
SOUND FADES IN TOO. TCHICK! KA-TCHICK-TCHICKY-TCHICK! Soft. Metallic. It makes us nervous. 
EXT. UNIONTOWN - NIGHT 
IN COLOR: A FULL MOON shines over a picture-perfect American town. PEOPLE, seen in SILHOUETTE, stroll past quaint shops whose signs promise RELIABLE APPLIANCES, WELL-MADE CLOTHES, SOLID VALUES. A DINER has a neon sign that offers the "BEST EATS IN TOWN". But something is wrong. The neon isn't lit. Nothing in town is lit. Street lamps, windows, are all dark. TCHICK! KA-TCHICK-TCHICK. That DISTURBING SOUND continues. 
Some of the PEDESTRIANS drift into "UNIONTOWN PARK", milling around a GAZEBO, where THREE "MUSICIANS" are struggling with a trombone, a saxophone, and a tambourine. They can't seem to make the instruments work, except for the tambourine player, who is rattling out a few very unrhythmic beats. That's where that sound is coming from. TCHICK! KA-TCHICK-TCHICKY-TCHICK. A CLOSER INSPECTION REVEALS: The "MUSICIANS" are DEAD. So are the "PEDESTRIANS". Flesh is rotting off their bones. The town itself, which at first looked so perfect, is ROTTING TOO. 
MIKE (O.S.) 
They're trying to be us. 
RILEY (O.S.) 
They used to be us.

EXT. HILLTOP ABOVE UNIONTOWN - NIGHT 
RILEY 
(Worried) They're learning how to be us again. RILEY DENBO watches the town through binoculars. 32, made rugged by realities, he has a heart beneath his tough exterior. MIKE CONVERSE, 21, young and unseasoned, has the eagerness and passion of someone young and unseasoned. 
MIKE 
Riley turns. Sees the thing. And, surprisingly, he relaxes, recognizing CHARLIE HOUK, a heavily-armed guerilla whose intellect is as burned as his face. 
CHARLIE 
Tcha doin', Riley? 
RILEY 
Havin' a bad dream. 
CHARLIE 
I have bad dreams. Hell, yes. Just look at me, you can tell that I have terrible dreams. 
RILEY 
The town is full of walkers. 
CHARLIE 
Every town is full of walkers. 
RILEY 
These aren't just walking. They're like...regular folks. 
CHARLIE 
But they're dumb, Riley. Hell, dead folks is near as dumb as me! 
RILEY 
You learned how to make yourself useful. That's what they're doing. 
WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) 
They dumped the trash. Cholo's on his way. 
Riley and Mike look across the room in the direction of the 
voice. Twenty feet away, a WOMAN sits at the controls of what looks like a scavenged airplane cockpit that's outfitted with a mixture of high- and low-tech equipment. She wears a black 
leather jacket with "PRETTY BOY" emblazoned across the back. 
MIKE 
(Surprised) Pretty Boy's a dame? 
RILEY 
This one is. Last one was a guy. 
MIKE 
What happened to him? Pretty Boy turns, poking her finger through a BULLET HOLE encrusted with year-old BLOOD in the chest of her jacket. 
PRETTY BOY 
I kept his jacket. For good luck. 
MIKE 
Luck? 
RILEY 
Put some flowers in the graveyard. Pretty Boy reaches out and flips a toggle switch on the control panel. THOOMB! THOOMB! DEEP CONCUSSIVE SOUNDS can be felt as much as heard as... 
I

EXT. DEAD RECKONING - NIGHT 
...RILEY, CHARLIE, and MIKE step out of A VEHICLE the size of a city bus. The words DEAD RECKONING are painted on its side. This is no bus. It's a war wagon, built of SCAVENGED PARTS with a RIVETED STEEL SKIN. GATTLING GUNS protrude from a MEAN-LOOKING SNOUT. A ROOF TURRET supports two FOURTEEN INCH-CANNONS. Rotating lights SHINE in all directions, piercing the night. THOOMB! THOOMB! THOOMB! That sound again. MORTAR TUBES on the vehicle's roof are launching FIREWORKS that BURST in the sky. 
CHARLIE 
(Looking up) `Flowers in the graveyard'. Why do you call `em that, Riley? I don't get it. These here flowers ain't the kind you lay down on the ground. These here are sky flowers. Way up in Heaven. 
R 
ILEY 
I love ya, Charlie. Know why? Cuzz you still believe in heaven. 
THE WHITE MOVING VAN rolls in and parks beside Dead Reckoning. 
CHOLO jumps out with the THREE GUERILLAS from the dump. 
HOLO 
You guys scope out the town? 
RILEY 
iley, stunned, lets the corpse slide to the floor. He looks into the rookie's open eyes, devastated. 
B 
EXT. MAIN STREET - UNIONTOWN - NIGHT 
THE WHITE MOVING VAN, THE T-BIRD, AND THE JEEP roll out of town in a convoy. Trailing them, THREE SADISTIC GUERILLAS on MOTORCYCLES ROAR past, firing... ...a HAIL OF BULLETS at A DEAD FAMILY on the sidewalk. The MOTHER FALLS. Not shot. It has been GRABBED and SHOVED down to the ground by... ...BIG DADDY! Who GRABS the little GIRL next, thrusting her roughly behind the protection of a wrecked car. The FATHER is last. Big Daddy grabs it from behind, by its hair, just as... ...ROUNDS from an UZI DRILL A DOTTED-LINE across the Father's neck. Big Daddy is unhurt, but spattered with BLOOD. Not red, greenish-black. The blood of the dead. 
T 
here's a RIPPING SOUND as the Father's NECK is PULLED APART by the weight of its limp body. The body DROPS to the street. 
The HEAD remains suspended in Big Daddy's hand. His face contorts. His mouth opens and closes, trying to utter sounds. ig Daddy drops the head, looking down at its befuddled eyes with sympathy. After a moment, the sympathy is joined by rage. Big Daddy lifts his right foot and brings it STOMPING DOWN on the disembodied head, CRUSHING ITS SKULL. 
The convoy ROARS off, leaving a cloud of exhaust. Big Daddy 
sees Harry's downed motorcycle lying in the street. The butt of an AUTOMATIC RIFLE protrudes from a saddlebag. 
Big Daddy goes over. Pulls out the rifle. Tests the weight of it in his hand. Curls his finger in through the guard and pulls the trigger. BLAM! A bullet ricochets off a brick wall. Big Daddy is startled at first. Then, he relaxes, realizing the rifle's power. With surprising dexterity, he slings the weapon's strap over his head and across his chest, patting the strap as if comforted by it. Turning, he looks toward... ...THE DISTANT GLOW OF A SKYSCRAPER that can be seen ON THE HORIZON. That's the direction the convoy is headed. That's where the bad men came from. That's where he wants to go. 
REVERSE ANGLE: 
With the city in the distance, Big Daddy starts walking. NUMBER NINE falls into step beside him. Soon there are MORE. None of them knows where they are going. Or why. All that seems to matter is that they have a leader. 
EXT. DEPOT - PRE-DAWN 
DEAD RECKONING, emitting tendrils of HOT STEAM from twenty steel nostrils, stands parked in a corner of a fenced-in outdoor yard. (We don't see how big the yard is. Yet.) A SEARCHLIGHT sweeps the darkness as GUERILLAS unload the supplies they took from Uniontown and carry them toward... ...a set of RUSTY STEEL DOORS, above which is a FADED SIGN that reads "SUBWAY (TO CITY)". In the bustle of activity, HARRY, the biker who was attacked in town, perspires as he helps unload. He looks ill. RILEY walks past, handing out bottles of beer to the men. 
RILEY 
Harry. Beer? 
Harry doesn't answer. 
RILEY (CONT'D) 
Harry? Harry SPINS! GROWLS! LUNGES at Riley like a beast! Riley has no time to reach for his gun. The Harry-Thing is strangling him. SMASHING the neck of a beer bottle on the snout of Dead Reckoning, Riley JAMS THE JAGGED GLASS into 
the Harry-Thing's forehead. Its body drops to the ground. 
PRETTY BOY 
Got knocked off his bike in town. Must have been bit. Riley looks down at the body with a mixture anger and regret. 
INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - DAWN 
A mile-long subway tunnel extends into BLACKNESS. A wide PLATFORM runs the length of the tracks, at the head of which A DERELICT TRAIN is parked. A CARGO CARRIER pulls out, driving along the platform, its flatbed piled with supplies, while ANOTHER CARRIER is being loaded with boxes of food, pharmaceuticals, ammunition, and... 
TWO BODY BAGS. 
CHARLIE 
Shit happens, Riley. 
RILEY 
(Blaming himself) Only if you let it. 
T 
The cargo carrier that was first to pull out drives into the tunnel. CEILING LIGHTS spaced far apart STUTTER on and off. Two guerillas, ANCHOR and MOUSE, who looks like a mouse, ride on the open flatbed with the cargo. The tunnel is filled with looming steel shapes that cast menacing shadows. Mouse shifts nervously. Suddenly... ...PLINK! SOMETHING WET FALLS ON HIS FACE! He JUMPS. Recovers. Wipes his cheek with his sleeve. 
MOUSE 
I hate going under the fuckin' river. 
He takes out a joint. Lights up. The match FLARES. SPLAT! Mouse and the match are soaked by WATER dripping from above. 
EXT. THE CITY - DAY 
RIVERS flank a TRIANGLE OF LAND where A CITY glows in the 
sunrise. Once proud and prosperous, its buildings now seem like tombstones. SEVEN BARRICADED BRIDGES span the rivers. 
ANNOUNCER (O.S.) 
Protected on three sides by mighty rivers, the city stands as a monument 
to man's ingenuity. At the center of it all is Fiddler's Green. 
INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - DAWN 
A TV MONITOR broadcasts views of A KITCHEN, A PLUSH LIVING 
ROOM, A DEN with a VIDEO FIREPLACE. 
ANNOUNCER (O.S.) 
Luxury living in the grand old style. Dine at one of three restaurants. Look for that perfect gift in our fabulous shopping mall. 
he monitor shows a huge ATRIUM with shops and restaurants. 
GUERILLA (O.S.) 
They make it sound nice. 
CHOLO (O.S.) 
It is nice. Holding his case of Dom Perignon and his box of Cohibas, CHOLO looks with FOXY at a monitor mounted to a white-tiled subway station wall. Down the tunnel behind them, the other GUERILLAS unload supplies from CARGO CARRIERS parked on the platform. A sign reads, "GOLDEN TRIANGLE/FIDDLER'S GREEN". 
SECURITY GUARD 
What's in them boxes? 
CHOLO 
Essential supplies. For the man upstairs. 
l 
R 
The Guard takes Cholo's weapons and returns a claim check. CHOLO collects his boxes and steps onto an escalator that carries him up into an ENORMOUS ATRIUM. The "mall" we saw on TV. SUNLIGHT splashes through glass walls onto box-planted trees. Caged birds CHIRP seemingly in tune with the Chopin that lilts over a sound system. SHOPPERS, expensively over- dressed, stroll past stores. OTHER RESIDENTS lunch at "outdoor" cafes. Cholo pulls out a kerchief and wipes the smudges off his face, trying to make himself presentable. 
EXT. "GOLDEN TRIANGLE" - MORNING 
FIDDLER'S GREEN, a heavily protected HIGH-RISE in the center of the city, dominates the skyline. It's where the Fat Cats live, protected from urban decay. The building is surrounded by unoccupied high-rises that define "the golden triangle", a clean section in the center of the city. No ugliness in view. 
RILEY and CHARLIE cross a manicured plaza to a CHECKPOINT 
manned by TWO SECURITY GUARDS. Riley hands over his ID. 
RILEY 
Quittin' time, Deke. 
SECURITY GUARD 
(Holding up the ID) You're gonna need this. 
RILEY 
(Walking on) Nope. When I said quittin' time, I meant quittin' 
time. 
EXT. "GHETTO" - MORNING 
RILEY and CHARLIE walk down a street into the city's "ghetto" zone, which is lined with taverns, gambling clubs, strip joints, like a boom town from Alaskan gold-rush days. BUYERS and SELLERS lurk in the shadows, copulating, dealing drugs. 
iley is welcomed by nearly everyone he passes, greeting them in return with a smile and a nod, handing some bills to a FATHER with a YOUNG SON, patting an OLD MAN on the back. 
CHARLIE 
Wanna get a drink, Riley? Just ook at me, you can tell I could use a drink. 
RILEY 
Later. Gotta see a man about a car. 
Charlie follows Riley, who strides into... ...an alley, surprised to find a cadre of rough-looking REVOLUTIONARIES, led by MULLIGAN, a defiant man who stands on a soapbox. A small audience is gathered in front of him. He takes a swig from a bottle of whiskey. 
MULLIGAN 
Irish accent) How long are you gonna let him push you around? If there was enough of us...if you all would join up with us...we could pull him down off his throne! Some of the people in the audience nervously shift their eyes to the FIDDLER'S GREEN HIGH-RISE ten blocks away. 
RILEY 
You can't fix a place like this, Mulligan. You just have to get out 
of it. 
MULLIGAN 
We've got the firepower, Riley. If you and your friends would come in with us, we'd be unstoppable. Mulligan holds out his bottle to Riley, who passes it to Charlie, who takes a swig. 
RILEY 
Everyone's stoppable. We hear the sound of a boy coughing. Mulligan's son BRIAN stands behind him, looking feverish. 
MULLIGAN 
You alright, son? 
BRIAN 
I'm fine, dad. As Riley starts past, he stops, pulls something from his pocket, and presses it into Mulligan's palm. 
RILEY 
Antibiotics. For your boy. Mulligan looks down with gratitude at a bottle his hand. When he looks up again, Riley is gone. 
H 
H 
EXT. GARAGE - MORNING 
Turning a corner, RILEY and CHARLIE stop in front of a rundown GARAGE with a tarp hanging down instead of a door. Riley pulls it aside and looks in. A HOBO lies asleep on a grease-stained floor, curled under some old newspapers. 
RILEY 
Where's the car? 
OBO 
(Waking) What car? 
RILEY 
...the back door of the apartment BURSTS OPEN and a SECURITY GUARD lunges into the kitchen, rifle in hand. 
SECURITY GUARD 
(To Cholo) Drop it! Cholo drops the poker and holds up his hands. 
CHOLO 
Hey, no problem. TWO MORE SECURITY GUARDS come through the apartment's front door and rush into the kitchen. 
CHOLO (CONT'D) 
No problem, no problem! But there is a problem. There's a dead guy 
walkin' around in here. 
THE HANGED MAN appears without warning, attacking one of the 
guards who just entered, BITING OFF half his left CHEEK, including the EYE. 
Before his partner can raise his gun, THE WOMAN GRABS IT FROM HIM! Aims at the Hanged Man. 
WOMAN 
YOU SELFISH BASTARD! YOU LEFT ME 
ALONE HERE! 
She fumbles with the weapon, not knowing how to make it work. 
The bitten security guard starts to lose all strength in his legs. The Dead Thing holds him up, as if waltzing with him, BITING HIM again and again. Cholo takes the gun from the woman and shoots the Hanged Man. 
BITTEN SECURITY GUARD 
I need help. I need help! 
Cholo kills the bitten security guard, too. 
SURVIVING SECURITY GUARD 
You...FUCK! 
Cholo turns the gun on the surviving security guard. 
CHOLO 
You wanna talk about this? I did what I had to do. I only did what I had to do!

INT. "THE ARENA" - DAY 
RILEY and CHARLIE step into the CELLAR of an old BROWNSTONE. Dirt floor. Stone walls. The place is filled with smoke and BUZZING with FLIES. As Riley and Charley turn their guns over to TWO BIG BRUISERS inside, a TOUT named ROACH sidles over. 
TOUT 
(Eyeing the weapons) Supply run last night, uh? Bet you have some money in your pocket. I can show you how to turn that money into more money. 
RILEY 
Roach. Where's Chihuahua? 
TOUT 
Maybe I can find him for you. Come on in. 
Riley is already in. He has pushed past the Tout and is striding into a fog where GAMBLERS are rushing to place bets with heavily-armed BOOKIES. We're reminded of a cock-fighting 
joint in a Pancho Villa movie. 
RILEY 
Lot of action tonight. 
TOUT 
Gotta new kind of game. 
iley strides toward a cluster of BETTORS. A very tall man 
stands among them, wearing a Texas Stetson that sticks up high above all other heads, its peacock feathers poking even higher out of a snake-skin hat band. 
iley grabs him and spins him around. 
he man's feet are off the ground. Way off the ground. Far from tall, he's a little person, who has been standing on a platform, wearing a purple satin pimp-suit. He's a Latino, who looks like a Chihuahua. And that's his name. CHIHUAHUA. 
C 
HIHUAHUA 
Put me down! Put me down! 
ILEY 
Black makes another try for the woman. Red grabs its rival. This time Black hangs on to Red's shirt. The two twirl around in a staggering lampoon of a wrestling match. Slack rushes to the side of the cage and starts to climb. She's agile. Strong. But she almost falls as the cage SHAKES with the force of... ...Red SLAMMING Black against the mesh. On their way back through the arena, RILEY and CHARLEY push through the crowd, trying to reach the center ring. A GOON steps in front of them. 
GOON 
No guns in here! Riley gives him a rifle butt in the face and moves on. 
S 
lack continues to climb the cage, almost out of reach, but Black grabs one of her ankles, pulling her down and slamming her to the ground. 
Black hunkers, drooling, over Slack. As it is about to bite, RAT-A-TAT! A short burst from Riley's M-16 shatters Black's 
collarbone. Cheekbone. Skull. The Thing drops. 
Red lunges for Slack. Riley kills it with another short BURST. 
he crowd PANICS, stampeding toward the exit. Suddenly MORE BULLETS FLY, this time from a GLOCK, FIRED by... 
...CHIHUAHUA, who, in a rage, is pushing through the LEGS of the fleeing crowd. He makes it to a clear spot and draws a steady bead on a target...Charlie. Chihuahua pulls his trigger. Riley beats him by an instant, FIRING the M-16. 
Just as Chihuahua's gun GOES OFF...a LINE of BULLET HOLES PERFORATES the little man's belly. The round from his Glock misses Charlie completely. 
Riley runs to the cage, where Slack stands, trembling, just on the other side of the bars. 
R 
ILEY 
You okay? 
F 
C 
She nods gratefully. 
hihuahua is still on his feet. And now he is really pissed. Not because of the holes in his gut, but because... 
CHIHUAHUA 
My suit! You fucked up my new suit! 
Riley turns to Chihuahua, but doesn't have time to lift the M-16 before...BLAM! The little man FIRES at him. Slack delivers a powerful KICK into the flexible fencing, sending Riley sprawling to the ground and saving him from... 
...Chihuahua's round, which misses Riley...but HITS SLACK! Spun around by the impact, she falls face down. 
Chihuahua continues to FIRE. Riley Marine-crawls as bullets PUNCH around him, SPARKING off the cage. Chihuahua keeps coming, keeps FIRING, until... 
...A SINGLE SHOT from Charlie's .45 shatters his skull. He drops like a broken pinata. 
Riley looks up, seeing TWO OTHER MEN with guns. Chihuahua's GOONS. For a moment it seems as if a major shooting match is going to break out. But before it does... 
POLICEMAN (O.S.) 
Hold it! 
..FOUR POLICEMEN burst in. The Goons lower their weapons. Riley runs back to the cage, BLASTS the lock on the nearest gate, and rushes inside. Slack's body is lying on the floor. He suspects she's dead. When her BODY MOVES, he suspects worse. He plants the barrel of his M-16 against her temple. 
SLACK 
I'm alright, I'M ALRIGHT! 
Slack uses her left arm to push herself up to a sitting position. Her right arm is BLEEDING, up near the shoulder. 
SLACK (CONT'D) 
ucker got my right arm. I'm a lefty. 
They look into each other's eyes. 
RILEY 
Seen you around. 
SLACK 
Seen you around. 
Y 
I 
A POLICEMAN steps over. 
POLICEMAN 
The hell happened here? 
RILEY 
Somebody shot the little fat man. 
POLICEMAN 
Yeah, I see that. You're under arrest. 
INT. BOARD ROOM - FIDDLER'S GREEN - DAY 
A UNIFORMED GUARD leaves CHOLO in a PRISTINE WHITE conference room with glass walls overlooking the rotting CITY far below. Cholo sets the case of champagne and the box of Cohibas on a conference table. A SMAN stands in SILHOUETTE at the windows. 
CHOLO 
No, no, no. Three years! Three years I been cleaning up after you, taking out your garbage, and you tell me I'm not good enough? You're the one who's no good. You are no fucking good. And you are gonna let me in. You know why? Because I know what goes on around here. How many of your fucking "members" know what's in that garbage I take out for you? 
Cholo lunges at Kaufman, grabs him by the collar. 
CHOLO (CONT'D) 
OU'LL LET ME IN OR I'LL... 
Cholo feels the barrel of a .45 against his waist. Kaufman, who has drawn the pistol from his jacket, is still smiling. 
KAUFMAN 
Maybe we should talk about this when you're less excited. 
Kaufman presses a button under the table. THREE SECURITY GUARDS rush in, GRAB Cholo, and drag him away. Kaufman stops one of the guards at the door. 
KAUFMAN (CONT'D) 
Softly) I won't be needing this man any more. 
INT. STAIRWELL - FIDDLER'S GREEN - DAY 
42   T                                                        42 
HE SECURITY GUARDS lead CHOLO down the stairs. Cholo WHIRLS like a Ninja. He SLUGS one guard, kicks another in the groin, the third in the face, and escapes through a fire door.

INT/EXT. JAIL - AFTERNOON 
RILEY RIPS off part of his shirt-sleeve and starts to bandage the wound on SLACK'S arm. They are in a jail cell that has brick walls and a small barred window facing a dark alley. CHARLIE, stripped of all his guns, stares outside longingly. 
RILEY 
(To Slack) Why you? In that arena. Why did the little fat man throw you in with those things? 
SLACK 
It wasn't the little man. It was the big man. The man upstairs. He's got his fingers in everything down here. If you can drink it, shoot it up, fuck it, or gamble on it, it belongs to him. He's just seein' that we get a few cheap kicks so we don't go thinkin' too hard about why he's eating steak and the rest of us are lucky to get the bones. 
RILEY 
Same question. Why you? 
SLACK 
They found out I was working with Mulligan and his people. Tired of eatin' off Cbones. 
HARLIE 
What can you do? Every place is the same. 
RILEY 
Places with people. I'm gonna find me a place where there ain't no people. North. Canada. 
SLACK 
Wherever you're going, take me ith you. 
CHARLIE 
He won't. Riley likes to be alone. He might take me. Cuzz havin' me around is pretty much the same as bein' alone. (Glancing at Riley) can make myself useful. And I an shoot. 
C 
S 
SLACK 
I can shoot. And I can be pretty fucking useful. I had training. I was gonna join the Army. Up the Green. Till somebody figured I'd be a better hooker than a soldier. 
RILEY 
I don't need to hear your story. Everybody's got a story, and I'm tired of hearin' them all! 
SLACK 
What's your story, Riley? 
They look at each other, clearly attracted. 
R 
ILEY 
I said everybody has a story. That was wrong. I don't have one. Daddy was a preacher. Mama kept the house. School. Engineering. Nothing bad ever happened to me...(turning away)...till everything changed. 
LACK 
Everything changed for all of us. Whether we had a story or not. 
A SOUND outside the window. Charlie glances through the bars. 
Double or nothing? 
BARRETT 
Sure. 
GUS aims his rifle at the jerking head of TONY BALONEY. As he is about to fire, there's a SOUND at his back. 
GUS 
Quit scratching around back there. You're tryin' ta fuck up my aim. 
BARRETT 
I'm just standin' here. I'm not doin' nothing. 
The SOUND comes again. From the woods that adjoin the lot. Barrett grabs the handles of a KLIEG LIGHT mounted on a pivot and swings it so that it ILLUMINATES the tree-line. 
T 
here's nothing there. Nothing but BRANCHES being slapped by erratic gusts of wind. 
Barrett pivots the Klieg light back to its original position, jumping out of his skin when the bright white beam reveals... A DEAD THING within arm's length. 
Barrett FIRES! The dead thing DROPS OUT OF FRAME, REPLACED BY ANOTHER. BLAM! Barrett SHOOTS again. This creature collapses. It is also replaced by another, which is also shot, as... BLAM! The top of Barrett's head is taken off by a rifle shot. The rifle was fired by BIG DADDY. The barrel is still smoking. In the darkness behind him stands NUMBER NINE. Behind Number Nine are the SHUFFLING SHADOWS of many more dead things. 
GUS SCREAMS. 
EXT. DEPOT - NIGHT 
CHOLO 
What's that? Screaming practice? 
GUNNER (O.S.) 
Stenches! Jesus! They're all over the place! 
THE DEPOT GUARD turns and runs toward his men. CHOLO'S TEAM unstraps weapons and gets ready for battle. 
CHOLO 
(Stopping them) Ain't our fight. Stenches are making it easy for us. 
C 
Let's grab the truck. 
HOLO and his team sprint across the lot to DEAD RECKONING. 
A GUNNER at a machine-gun battery opens fire on the WALKERS. Many of the rounds SPARK off the wire fencing. 
INT. DEAD RECKONING NIGHT 
CHOLO and his TEAM scramble into the vehicle. 
FOXY 
Should we send up some `sky flowers'? 
CHOLO 
No. Those things want to get in here...let `em in. 
EXT. DEPOT - NIGHT 
THE WALKING DEAD march through MACHINE GUN FIRE behind their "leader". BIG DADDY. He is the first to reach the fence surrounding the lot. Pushing against the wire, he is soon joined by NUMBER NINE. Then OTHERS. The FENCE COLLAPSES. The Dead Things SWARM into the depot. 
VROOOM! DEAD RECKONING pulls out. Rumbling over the section of fencing the zombies pushed down, it drives into the night. 
K 
SOLDIERS abandon their stations and scatter, shooting wildly. NUMBER NINE knocks one of them cold with its baseball bat. The soldier falls, losing his M-16. BIG DADDY grabs the bat and throws it aside. Picking up the soldier's M-16, he presses the weapon into Number Nine's hands, even arranging Number Nine's fingers on the trigger. RATATATAT. With the gun aimed at the ground, Number Nine fires a BURST that sends her into a spastic dance. The soldier sits back up. Draws a pistol. Big Daddy grabs the barrel of the still-firing M-16 and guides it along the pavement to... ...the soldier's legs. Bullets march up his groin, belly, chest, and, finally, head. He drops. ANOTHER SOLDIER attacks. This time, Number Nine aims her 
weapon purposefully and scores a direct hit. 
OTHER DEAD THINGS SMACK at the steel doors that lead down to 
the subway. They can't get through. Losing interest, they drift slowly away, until their attention is refocused by... 
...a GRUNT from Big Daddy, who is gazing toward the GLOW of the FIDDLER'S GREEN HIGH-RISE across the river, closer now than before. The city. That's where he wants to be. That's 
where he's determined to go. 
INT. KAUFMAN PENTHOUSE - FIDDLER'S GREEN - NIGHT 
KAUFMAN RIPS a TURKEY LEG off a cooked bird on a platter in front of him and eats. Across the table sits one of his board members, HARRISON SUTHERLAND. KNIPP enters. 
KNIPP 
Phone call, sir. 
KAUFMAN 
Thank you, Knipp. I'll take it. 
Knipp brings a radio-phone to the table. Kaufman picks up the receiver and lifts it to his ear. 
KAUFMAN 
EXT. 10TH STREET PIER - NIGHT 
A LONG DOCK juts into the RIVER. DEAD RECKONING stops beside 
it. MOUSE jumps out. CHOLO stands in an open hatch. 
MOUSE 
(Looking around nervously) Don't leave me alone here long. 
CHOLO 
At midnight. Give me a call. Let e know if we're rich or not. 
Mouse nods, running off to hide in a BOAT SHED. 
EXT. DEPOT - NIGHT 
The steel doors to the subway tunnel open. RILEY and his TEAM step out. The depot has been DEVASTATED. FIRES BURNING. FENCES DOWN. Only TONY BALONEY moves, still waving spookily. 
C 
HARLIE 
Geez. Cholo made a mess. 
RILEY 
Cholo didn't do all this. 
Clouds of thick black SMOKE from the fires BILLOW across the depot, restricting visibility. Ever-shifting OPENINGS in the clouds reveal glimpses of torn BODY PARTS. 
RILEY (CONT'D) 
Stenches have been at this place. 
He leads the way into the depot, his M-16 at the ready. Behind him, all eyes peer nervously into the smoke. Everyone speaks in HUSHED tones. 
MANOLETE 
When the truck pulled out, it must have knocked the fence down. That's how they got in. 
RILEY 
That fencing was pushed in from outside. 
TEAHOUSE 
You know how many stenches it would take to do that? 
RILEY 
There's a thousand of them out there for every one of us. 
CHARLIE 
Good thing we're smarter. 
SLACK 
Look who's talkin'. 
RILEY 
They're getting smart. I saw it in 
Uniontown, last time out. They're learning how to work together. Thoughts darken. So does the SMOKE, which billows thicker, virtually blinding the team. SOUNDS come. The MOANING of the WIND. The POPPING of burnt metal and wood. 
TEAHOUSE 
What do they want? Slack looks back as she walks. The zombies have taken down another section of the depot fence, beyond which lies a suburb. Beyond which is the river. Beyond which is the glow of the FIDDLER'S GREEN HIGH-RISE. 
SLACK 
They want the city. 
RILEY 
The city is us. They're after us. We pissed `em off one too many times. 
M 
O 
S 
T 
MANOLETE 
They'll never get across the river. 
CHARLIE 
Thank Heaven. 
RILEY 
Gotta love the guy. He still believes in Heaven. Anyone got a radio? Teahouse pulls a Motorola from his belt. Just as he tosses it to Riley, they hear...GROWLING! 
Suddenly, CHARLIE draws his .45 and FIRES AT SLACK! BLAM! The bullet buzzes just above her ear, blowing a WISP OF HAIR as... 
C 
T 
S 
...A DEAD OLD MAN BEHIND HER DROPS, a HOLE in its head. 
LACK 
Thanks, Charlie. That was useful. 
The WIND shifts and black SMOKE envelopes them. 
MANOLETE 
I can't see! 
Riley pulls out a flashlight and shines it under the dash. 
he team fans out around the T-Bird. The smoke is so thick they can't make out anything. Including each other. 
harlie peers into openings that shift on the breeze. What he doesn't see, what he can't see, is what's behind him... 
..a FEMALE WALKER, wearing the soiled and tattered remnants of a bridal gown. The fabric seems to glow in the smoke. The bride shuffles toward CHARLIE. We see it coming. No one else does. Just as it opens its mouth to bite... BLAM! Slack SHOOTS! Her bullet cuts closer than the one Charlie fired, CLIPPING OFF THE TOP OF HIS EAR before 
DROPPING THE BRIDE. 
SLACK 
Even-Steven. 
CHARLIE 
Not! That hurt! I didn't hurt you! 
Manolete fumbles with colored wires under the dash. 
RILEY 
Hurry up. 
PILLSBURY 
(Impatient) Yellow to red! 
TEAHOUSE 
What the fuck does a Samoan know about hot-wiring cars? 
PILLSBURY 
Five thousand cars. Stole. Every year in Samoa. 
MANOLETE 
Fifty thousand in Mexico. 
R 
PILLSBURY 
Mexico got a million cars. Samoa got five thousand. Every one. Stolen. 
THE T-BIRD'S ENGINE REVS. 
MANOLETE 
I GOT IT! LET'S GET OUT OF HERE! 
Riley leads the team into the T-Bird. Manolete starts to get out from under the dash. As TEAHOUSE settles into a seat by the door... ...SOMETHING heavy and wet SMACKS his shoulder. It's a FOREARM! It drops onto Teahouse as if thrown at him. 
TEAHOUSE 
God! Oh, GOD, WHAT'S THIS?! 
Teahouse HURLS the bloody thing onto the asphalt. Shockingly, the ARM SPRINGS BACK, THUMPING against Teahouse's face! A twist of torn muscle, no thicker than clothesline, is keeping the limb loosely attached to... 
...A DEAD THING that has crawled beside the T-Bird. Lifting itself, it BITES a large filet out of Teahouse's arm. CHARLIE 
M 
SHOOTS it. 
anolete climbs up behind the wheel and...VROOOOOM!...pedal to the metal he pulls out of the depot. Slack glances at Teahouse, then, wind in her hair, leans in close to Riley. 
SLACK 
(Softly) How long does he have? 
RILEY 
I had a brother. Real brother, by birth. Bit. Hung on for six days. Before he turned. I was the one had to shoot him. 
SLACK 
And you said nothin' bad ever happened to you. 
No buts. 
CLIFF 
But... 
Kaufman looks disappointed. Taking Cliff by the arm, smiling again, he leads him over to an outer door and opens it. An armed SECURITY GUARD stands in the corridor outside. 
KAUFMAN 
Take him out with the rest of the garbage. I won't be needing this man anymore. 
W 
F 
O 
At the conference table, Sutherland sees the light coming in from the outer corridor, better defining the silhouettes as the Security Guard drags Cliff away. 
S 
UTHERLAND 
(To Styles) Pretty soon it's going to be one of us. 
EXT. CARNEGIE - NIGHT 
n an overgrown suburban street, a LAWN TRACTOR, driven by a GARDENER in work clothes, drives back and forth, back and forth, over a swath of dead grass. The gardener is DEAD too. 
INT. DEAD RECKONING - NIGHT 
CHOLO watches the GARDENER through the windshield. 
CHOLO 
If I don't have this truck, I'm no different to Kaufman than that poor Mexican bastard out there. 
CLOSE ON: CHOLO'S WATCH. 11:20. 
OXY 
He's never gonna pay. 
CHOLO 
He knows it's his ass if he doesn't. 
Cholo slides open a small window, grabs his crossbow, and SHOOTS the Gardener in the head. 
EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT 
ANGLE ON: A SOLID WALL OF WOOD. BIG DADDY, NUMBER NINE, and OTHERS OF THE DEAD push against it. The wood holds. 
Big Daddy turns, surveying his troops. Focusing on the BUTCHER. On the meat cleaver it has in its hand. Big Daddy pounds on the wood, demonstrating. Points at the meat cleaver. Pounds again. The Butcher gets it. Approaches the wall. HACK! The meat cleaver chops into wood, splintering it. REVERSE ANGLE: from the other side of the wall as the wood splinters to reveal BIG DADDY'S EYES staring through at... ...the FIDDLER'S GREEN HIGH-RISE, looming closer than it was before, though it's still across the river. 
S 
R 
R 
EXT. MCKEE'S ROCKS - NIGHT 
CLOSE ON: a small, electronic unit, the size and appearance of a "Game Boy". AN LED SCREEN shows a BLINKING RED DOT moving along a MAP. 
RILEY (O.S.) 
Turn left up here. SLACK, driving the T-BIRD now, makes the turn. The car blows through a deserted town, moving fast. Riley notices that Slack is effected by the desolation she sees. 
ILEY 
How long since you been out here? 
SLACK 
Never been out. Lived in the city since...it was a regular city. 
ILEY 
Pull over. 
SLACK 
(Surprised) Huh? 
RILEY 
You said you were going to make yourself useful. Right now what I could use is for you to pull over. 
he does. The T-Bird stops along a road bordered by a MARSH thick with tall CAT TAILS. Unexpectedly, Riley stands and points his automatic at PILLSBURY and MANOLETE. 
RILEY 
I made a deal with your boss. Find Cholo. I'm gonna do it. Keep him from blowing up the Green. I'm gonna do it, I don't want people to get hurt. Bring back Dead Reckoning... Sorry. That's where I stop. I didn't ask him for much, just guns, ammo, and a car. I've got the guns. I've got the ammo. And if I find Dead Reckoning I'm gonna have the best fucking car that's ever been built, and I'm taking it to Canada. If any of you don't like that idea... 
Riley reaches down and opens the passenger door. Manolete looks out and sees the CAT TAILS MOVING. THREE WALKERS are slogging through the marsh. 
C 
What's there? 
RILEY 
Powder magazine. Where they keep the big boomers. Rockets. For Dead Reckoning's cannons. 
INT. SHED - 10TH STREET PIER - NIGHT 
MOUSE looks at a GRIMY WINDOW as the SHADOW of a WALKER stops just beyond the glass. Mouse FIRES a BURST shattering the window and dropping the Walker. Silence. Mouse takes a tentative step toward the window. A SCRATCHING SOUND. SOMETHING climbs up onto the sill from outside. Mouse raises his gun, but hesitates when he sees... ...it's a child. A GIRL SCOUT. It died at age nine, still wearing its uniform. Now, it's voracious. It grabs Mouse's gun-hand. The weapon FIRES harmlessly into the floor. Mouse is about to be chomped when... ...a STALAGMITE OF GLASS in the top of the shattered window drops, PIERCING the Girl Scout's head. Mouse runs SCREAMING to the door, where he is grabbed by another DEAD THING. And another. As he is TORN APART, he sees 
that there are DOZENS MORE. 
EXT. RIVER - NIGHT 
CRANE UP TO REVEAL: 
...AN ARMY OF THE DEAD LINING THE RIVERBANK FOR AS FAR AS THE 
EYE CAN SEE. 
CLOSE ON: BIG DADDY. Only the river now flows between he and his goal: FIDDLER'S GREEN HIGH-RISE, so near and yet so far. 
INT. KAUFMAN PENTHOUSE - NIGHT 
WHAM! The door SLAMS behind KAUFMAN as he enters the foyer. KNIPP emerges from the rear. 
KNIPP 
Any word from Mister Denbo, sir? 
KAUFMAN 
No. Pack us up. We might have to be leaving. 
KNIPP 
In the helicopters? 
KAUFMAN 
We'll only need one of them. 
INT/EXT. DEAD RECKONING - NIGHT 
PRETTY BOY eases the vehicle up the road to the complex of buildings: ROSS PARK, a sprawling munitions depot. The searchlight continues to sweep across the night, but NO ONE is manning it. It's mounted to an automatic rotator on the roof of the main building. 
FOXY 
Looks like no one's here. The gates stand wide open. There's no sign of life. 
CHOLO punches a button. The SIDE HATCH HISSES OPEN. 
CHOLO 
Foxy. You're elected. Get out there and see what the fuck. 
Foxy moves out through the open hatch. 
CHOLO (CONT'D) 
Somebody go out and help. 
SCAR grabs his weapons. 
SCAR 
I'll go. 
EXT. RIVER - NIGHT 
ONE OF THE DEAD TOPPLES face first into the water, dropping out of sight. ANOTHER FALLS. BIG DADDY looks at the spot where his brothers fell in. He looks for a long time, cocking his head like a puppy trying to understand a high wind. The first Dead Thing slowly rises out of the water. Then the Second. They stand, waist deep, in the shallows. Big Daddy gazes down at the water, a concept dawning. Then, with grim purpose, he steps deliberately off the low wall. Hitting the river, he manages to stay on his feet. Standing, waist deep, with the others, he scoops up water with his one good hand. Sniffs it. Tastes it. He looks up. Sees the CITY LIGHTS REFLECTED ON THE RIVER. He tries to express his thoughts. All that comes from his mouth is a series of inarticulate moans. He's incapable of transmitting his idea. So he does what he's been doing since Uniontown. He leads. He walks toward the city. Out of the shallows. Into deep water. Over his head. 
INT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT 
There are AUTOMOBILE TIRES, GARBAGE CANS, a rusted ANCHOR, a sunken MOTOR BOAT, HUNDREDS of BEER BOTTLES...AND THOUSANDS OF DEAD THINGS...WALKING...ON THE RIVER BOTTOM...following BIG DADDY through the debris. 
INT. TENEMENT - NIGHT 
A knock on a door is answered by A MAN who looks a bit too greasy to be important. SUTHERLAND is outside. 
SUTHERLAND 
How much is Kaufman paying you and your men? 
GREASY MAN 
Four hundred a day. Each. 
STYLES 
I'll pay you five thousand a day. Each. 
EXT. T-BIRD - NIGHT 
The car speeds down the road with SLACK at the wheel. 
INT. T-BIRD - NIGHT 
RILEY looks at his watch. 11:40. 
Riley'd never do that. Just look at him, you can tell he'd never do that. 
RILEY 
Keep an eye on the hatches. If I get in, I'll try to leave one open. Riley takes off. Charlie looks torn. He wants to go with Riley, but he has to keep PILLSBURY and Manolete covered. 
PILLSBURY 
I like dat man. You go help `im. I take care of dis sissy. 
Pillsbury, moving fast for a big woman, POUNDS Manolete's temple with a mighty fist. He drops like a lead weight. 
EXT. ROOFTOP - FIDDLER'S GREEN - NIGHT 
The door to the roof opens and the GREASY MAN from "downtown" steps out of a fire stair with ANOTHER GREASY MAN. SUTHERLAND remains inside the door. 
GREASY MAN 
I don't know about this. I mean... 
leavin' people behind... 
SUTHERLAND 
Kaufman was gonna leave people behind. So we're leaving him. 
The Greasy Men go trotting across the rooftop. As they climb into TWO HELICOPTERS, we realize that they are PILOTS. 
EXT. HILLSIDE STREET - NIGHT 
RILEY walks down the road. The GROWLING of the diesels is getting louder, the GLOW from the high-beams brighter. Riley is startled by a NOISE behind him. He whirls around and sees CHARLIE approaching. 
CHARLIE 
Everything's cool back there. Riley is about to object, when DEAD RECKONING comes rumbling around a corner a hundred yards down the street. Riley checks his watch again. 11:52. 
CHARLIE (CONT'D) 
Too late to send me back. 
RILEY 
Put on your Sunday smile. Try to look friendly. 
CHARLIE 
I am friendly. Just look at me you can tell I'm friendly. 
INT. DEAD RECKONING - NIGHT 
In the cab, PRETTY BOY eases off the gas. CHOLO looks out the windshield as the headlights strike... 
CHOLO 
Denbo. And his idiot. (Beat) Stop. Gimme the mike. 
The vehicle crunches to a stop forty yards away. Pretty Boy hands Cholo a microphone. Cholo speaks into it. 
CHOLO (CONT'D) 
How'd you get up here, Riley? 
INTERCUT: BETWEEN THE STREET AND DEAD RECKONING'S CAB. 
RILEY 
Grabbed the T-Bird. 
CHOLO 
What are you doin' up here? 
RILEY 
Tracking you. With this. 
Riley holds up his "Game Boy". Cholo looks surprised. 
RILEY (CONT'D) 
Truck's got a little transmitter in her belly. Sorry I never told you. 
CHOLO 
You were always a smart guy, Riley. Much smarter'n me. 
RILEY 
You went and took off without inviting us along. 
CHOLO 
You weren't around to get invited. Anyway, I figured you wouldn't want in on this. 
RILEY 
We want in on anything you got goin'. 
CHOLO 
PRETTY BOY lifts a clear cover off a RED FIRING BUTTON. 
RILEY 
Hit the tower square, you'll kill a lot of innocent people. Miss and hit the city, you'll kill a lot of our friends. Your beef's with Kaufman, not them. The turret on the roof GROANS as the cannons rotate. 
CHOLO 
He's killed a lot of our friends. Every week we took out the garbage, you and me. Every month I took out 
Kaufman's garbage. People he wanted off the streets. He turned me into a goon and then he pissed all over me! 
Foxy, keep `em covered. 
EXT. DEAD RECKONING - HILLSIDE - NIGHT 
The turret stops, cannons aimed directly at the GREEN. 
INT. DEAD RECKONING - NIGHT 
CHOLO moves to the RED FIRING BUTTON. 
CHOLO 
When the smoke clears, I'm gonna 
roll in, hit the bank, take the money, and pick up any other fancy shit I can get my hands on. 
RILEY 
There won't be any fancy shit left. And money burns. 
CHOLO 
Not when you keep it in a safe. 
EXT. DEAD RECKONING - HILLSIDE - NIGHT 
MANOLETE pulls one of the MACHINE GUNS out of its mount on the T-BIRD. Shouldering it, he creeps toward DEAD RECKONING. 
INT. DEAD RECKONING - NIGHT 
ON THE CONTROL PANEL: A CLOCK CLICKS DOWN TO MIDNIGHT. 
4...3...2...1...CHOLO reaches down and pushes the button. 
EXT. DEAD RECKONING - HILLSIDE - NIGHT 
The GUN BARRELS are cold. SILENT. 
INT. DEAD RECKONING - NIGHT 
CHOLO punches the button again. Again. Nothing happens. 
CHOLO 
WHAT THE FUCK? 
CHOLO'S eyes fall to the "Game Boy" in Riley's hand. 
CHOLO 
You did something, didn't you? With your FUCKING TOY! 
Riley pushes another button on the "Game Boy". Outside... 
EXT. DEAD RECKONING - HILLSIDE - NIGHT 
...TWO STEEL LOCKING RINGS swing up to cap the cannons. Just beyond the barrels we see MANOLETE closing in on DEAD 
RECKONING, raising his machine gun. A DEAD THING advances behind him. 
INT. DEAD RECKONING - NIGHT 
CHOLO charges RILEY. Grabs him around the throat. 
CHOLO 
Fix it! 
RILEY 
Not a chance. Riley tosses the "Game Boy" out the open hatch. Cholo reaches out after it. 
EXT. DEAD RECKONING - HILLSIDE - NIGHT 
MANOLETE has the machine gun aimed at DEAD RECKONING'S open hatch. Where CHOLO is standing. Out of the corner of his eye, RILEY sees Manolete's machine gun barrel flash in the moonlight. MANOLETE FIRES! RATATAT! RILEY PUSHES CHOLO OUT OF THE WAY JUST IN TIME! He drops from the hatch onto the pavement, wounded in the shoulder. The Walker starts to rip Manolete apart. Slack SHOOTS HIM in the head. Then she and PILLSBURY open fire on the Walker, destroying it. 
INT. DEAD RECKONING - NIGHT 
FOXY, distracted by the mayhem, lets CHARLIE get the drop on him. ANCHOR and SCAR go for their guns. RILEY unslings his M-16 and holds them at bay. 
RILEY 
Easy boys. Riley looks at the clock on the control panel. 12:01. Charlie follows his gaze. 
CHARLIE 
Geez. We just made it. Riley CLICKS the transmitter on. 
Back to the city. 
CHOLO 
Not this horse. You got the T-Bird? 
I'll take that. 
FOXY 
Me, too. 
FOXY jumps out of DEAD RECKONING and stands at Cholo's side. Riley, Slack, and Pillsbury climb aboard. Riley looks down at Cholo and Foxy. 
RILEY 
You guys'd be safer coming with us. 
CHOLO 
Nah, you'd never let me have any fun. 
RILEY 
T-Bird's down that driveway over there. Guns and ammo inside. 
CHOLO 
Thanks. 
INT. DEAD RECKONING - NIGHT 
RILEY closes the hatch. Blood trickles from under his chin where Cholo stuck him with the crossbow. SLACK reaches up and pulls off the bandana that holds back her hair, which cascades down. She uses the fabric to clean the blood off Riley's neck. He looks at her, touched by the familiarity of the gesture. 
SLACK 
Almost lost you there. 
RILEY 
I don't get lost so easy. (To PRETTY BOY) We gotta get across the water. 
PRETTY BOY 
The bridges into the city are all bricked up. 
PRETTY BOY hits a button. A MAP appears on a MONITOR, showing the "GOLDEN TRIANGLE" bordered by the rivers and the barricaded bridges spanning them. 
SLACK 
We could blast our way through. 
RILEY 
Don't want to. If the stenches got 
in, there's a war going on in the city. We take any of those bridges we'll end up right in the middle of it. Riley runs his finger along the monitor, outlining the natural and man-made barriers that protect the triangle. 
RILEY (CONT'D) 
We've gotta come in above the throat. His finger continues down the monitor to "THE THROAT" at the base of the triangle, where the long FENCE runs between the two rivers. 
RILEY (CONT'D) 
What was built to keep folks safe is gonna trap them inside. We've gotta give them a way out.

EXT. FIDDLER'S GREEN - NIGHT 
CLOSE ON: KAUFMAN staring out his PENTHOUSE WINDOW, aghast. LICKS OF FIRE reflect on the glass. SOUNDS OF WAR can be heard from far below. 
EXT. "GOLDEN TRIANGLE - NIGHT 
In the pristine plaza that surrounds the building, WALKERS swarm. CITIZENS run, screaming, including SOLDIERS, driven from their posts, who SHOOT at the Dead Things. 
CLOSE ON BIG DADDY. Who looks back and forth, as if torn, at the FIDDLER'S GREEN HIGH-RISE, at the violence in the streets, back at the building, back at the streets. A SOLDIER fires at him! Misses. Big Daddy raises his rifle and blows him away. 
EXT. HILLSIDE HOME DRIVEWAY - NIGHT 
CHOLO and FOXY run up the road to THE T-BIRD. Seeing a WALKER lurking ahead, they duck into the dark cover of the trees. 
HOLO 
I got it. 
WFFFFT! Cholo picks off the Walker with his crossbow. 
HOLO (CONT'D) 
Come on, let's go. 
BLAM! 
Riley stops running. Looks back to see what's being shot. 
SLACK 
You missed. 
CHARLIE 
Nope. I blew its ass off. The rat is now half a rat. Its ass has been blown off. Yet 
IT'S STILL RUNNING! 
CHARLIE (CONT'D) 
Just didn't hit it in the head. 
SLACK 
(Realizing) Jesus. It's dead. 
CHARLIE 
They all are. SKREEEEEEEE! ZOMBIE RATS crawl up onto the roadbed. DOZENS. Riley takes off away from them. Slack and Charlie hurry closer, firing, trying to pick the critters off. The rats reach Riley! Nip at his heels. He leaps. Swings onto a girder. Climbs to the control booth. The rats don't follow. Slack heaves a sigh of relief just before... ...SKREEEEEEEE! A second pack of rats scurries toward her! She vaults over a railing, dropping several feet to... ...the riverbank below. But there are rats here too! Charlie fires at them from above. BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! FUR AND BLOOD 
FLY. But there are too many. He can't shoot them all. 
INT. CONTROL BOOTH - J&L DRAWBRIDGE - NIGHT 
RILEY reaches the control booth. Draws his .45, expecting danger within. He steps through the opening... ...but nothing's there. Just a SPIDER WEB that sweeps over his face as he moves toward a RED SWITCH that activates a 
generator. He flips it. The motor roars to life. 
He turns toward a giant lever that operates the roadbed. It 
GROANS from disuse as he pulls it. 
EXT. J&L DRAWBRIDGE - NIGHT 
RED LIGHTS on the caution gates BLINK, tinting the night. The silence is shattered by a LOUD SIREN that ECHOES across the river. The bridge's roadbed begins to CREAK down slowly. 
EXT. RIVERBANK - NIGHT 
THREE DINGHIES lie, upside down, next to the water's edge. SLACK shoves one into the river, climbing onto its upturned bottom. She pushes off. The boat doesn't budge. A tether holds it within inches of the shore. Slack pulls out a jackknife and goes to cut the rope, but... 
...rats SNAP at her hands. Slack recoils, but keeps cutting. Finally, the rope frays, enough for the boat to pull free. 
T 
Slack crouches on top of the upturned hull. No way to steer. No paddles. The current carrying her away. 
CHARLIE 
Slack! 
INT. CONTROL BOOTH - J&L DRAWBRIDGE - NIGHT 
Hearing the scream, RILEY looks out the control booth window and sees... ...SLACK being taken downstream. 
EXT. J&L DRAWBRIDGE - NIGHT 
RILEY bursts out of the booth, only to be confronted by... 
...the BRIDGEKEEPER. Drooling. Dead. It grabs Riley, pushing his head back toward the enormous GEARWORKS of the bridge. 
Riley struggles. Bests the creature. Spins him around toward the gearworks and... 
...SSSNIPPPP! THE BRIDGEKEEPER'S HEAD is scissored off! It drops with a PLUNK into the river below. 
EXT. RIVER - NIGHT 
SLACK, adrift on the boat, lies prone at the bow and begins 
to paddle with her hands. One of which hits something long and slimy. It looks like a snake! But it's not. It's only a moss-covered rope. Slack grabs on. Pulls hand over hand. It seems to take forever for the rope to become taut. 
A FACE BOBS OUT OF THE WATER! 
Slack SCREAMS. It's the BRIDGEKEEPER'S HEAD, its eyes blinking as it floats off on the current. he rope is attached to a stanchion on the opposite shore. Slack's muscles strain as she pulls on it until... ...her boat reaches the stanchion and she jumps off, finding herself at the same boat ramp the army of the dead used. The river has carried her into the very part of the city Riley and the team were trying to avoid. SCREAMS rise nearby. She's in the war zone. 
EXT. J&L DRAWBRIDGE - NIGHT 
THE BRIDGE IS LOWERING SLOWLY. Too slowly. RILEY scrambles up the incline of the roadbed and calls back to CHARLIE. 
R 
ILEY 
Bring her over as soon as you can! 
Charlie pops back into DEAD RECKONING. Riley climbs to the top of the descending roadbed and... ...LEAPS across the narrowing gulf to the other side. He lands. Falls. Rolls. Gets to his feet and runs toward Slack and the city. 
EXT. "GOLDEN TRIANGLE" - NIGHT 
SLACK runs past hysterical PEOPLE toward the FIDDLER'S GREEN 
HIGH-RISE. BRIAN, Mulligan's young son, rushes by her in a panic. Slack grabs him. 
SLACK 
CHOLO (CONT'D) 
been bit, Mister K. I'm a dead man, so I don't care about nothin' no more. Still care about you, though. I wanna make sure you come to the same end as me. 
LANG! CLANG! CLANG! The Dead Things at the glass doors are POUNDING now with shovels, pickaxes, and lengths of pipe. 
CHOLO (CONT'D) 
hey're going to get you, Mister K. want them to get you. 
Kaufman raises his gun and aims at Cholo, who aims back with his crossbow.

CHOLO (CONT'D) 
ut it down, old man, unless you'd rather die right now. 
BIG DADDY appears outside the doors. Uses his pneumatic hammer to POUND at the safety glass. 
aufman can't take it anymore. He bolts for a stairway door. Cholo shoots. An arrows hits Kaufman in the back of his left calf. Kaufman sprawls, dropping both his bag of money and his gun, which skitters Kaway. Knipp rushes over to help Kaufman. 
NIPP 
Just let us go, Mister DeMora. Let us get out of here. 
CHOLO 
(Calmly reloading) You can go, Knipp, but not him. 
Kaufman shakes Knipp off. His gun is ten feet away. He heads for it. Dragging himself on hands and knees. 
CRUNCH! The chisel on Big Daddy's pneumatic hammer is the first tool to PENETRATE the doors. The glass doesn't shatter; it COBWEBS into tiny crystals stuck together by a thin plasticine coating. ALARM BELLS SOUND! 
Puzzled by the sudden transformation of the glass into something that looks different, Big Daddy drops the pneumatic hammer and reaches out. The glass is different. It's soft. Flexible. Big Daddy POKES HIS HAND right through. 
Kaufman has almost reached his gun. Cholo shoots another arrow. This one hits Kaufman in the shoulder. 
AUFMAN 
You fucking spic bastard! 
CHOLO 
I think we should talk when you're a little less excited. 
Kaufman has a will of iron. He keeps going, gritting his teeth against the pain, reaching out for his gun, as... 
CRUNCH! CRUNCH! CRUNCH! More tools PENETRATE the doors. More HANDS POKE through. 
aufman looks at his worst nightmare...Dead Things ripping their way through the cobwebbed doors, invading his temple. 
R 
M 
The commotion distracts Cholo just long enough for Kaufman to lift his gun and FIRE nine rounds. ost of the shots miss. TWO hit Cholo, one in the belly, one in the heart. He is slammed against the wall, his glazing eyes staring up into the atrium, the place he so desired. It's the last thing he sees before he keels over, dead. Knipp pulls Kaufman onto his feet. They look up to see... 
BIG DADDY leading his army into the atrium. Kaufman aims and FIRES. A BULLET HITS BIG DADDY in the upper chest, blowing DEAD FLESH out of his back. The Dead Man feels no pain, but it focuses on Kaufman and starts after him with purpose. 
Kaufman sees something in Big Daddy's eyes. Something that's not dead. Kaufman fires again. CLICK! He's out of ammo.

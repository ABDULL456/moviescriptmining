SHOT OF NOTEBOOK PAGE DAPPLED WITH SUNLIGHT 
POV of someone skimming a hand-written entry. The corresponding voice-over is offhand, dispassionate. In the background, children can be heard laughing and playing. 
BOB ARCTOR (V.O.) Lately, Jerry Fabin stands all day shaking bugs from his hair. The doctor says there are no bugs in his hair. 
The sound of fingers scratching scalp begins and grows louder through the following montage. 
EXT. COCA-COLA BOTTLING PLANT - PRE-DAWN 
SUBTITLE: ORANGE COUNTY, CALIFORNIA, IN THE YEAR 1994 
A massive, unlit Coca-Cola sign is eerily silhouetted against the early morning sky. Antiquated delivery trucks set out from loading docks, as red futuristic cargo planes, emblazoned with the Coca-Cola logo, take off from the roof. 
EXT. FREEWAY - PRE-DAWN 
Birds-eye view of Coca-Cola trucks spreading out through the city. Coke planes shoot by close to the camera. 
EXT. 7-11 - DAWN 
A Coke truck pulls into the parking lot. 
EXT. SUPERMARKET - DAWN 
A Coke plane lands gracefully on the roof of the supermarket. 
EXT. MCDONALD'S - DAWN 
Uniformed delivery men enter, hauling cases of Coke syrup. 
EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAWN 
A Coca-Cola truck rumbles slowly past a row of low-income, plastic pre-fab houses. We hold on one house whose front lawn is strewn with furniture and cleaning products. 
INT. JERRY FABIN'S LIVING ROOM - DAWN 
The windows are spray-painted over with silver paint. A single pole lamp with bare, harsh spot-lights illuminates the room, which is emptied of furniture, covered in a sickly green shag carpet, and littered with fast-food wrappers. In 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
the center of the room stands Jerry Fabin, thirty, with wild- eyes and a long, tangled mass of hair. He is naked, draped over a metal garbage can, and vigorously scratching his head. This process continues for an uncomfortably long time. A Golden Retriever sleeps in the corner. 
INT. JERRY FABIN'S BATHROOM - LATER 
Jerry Fabin stands under a hot shower. Steam fills the stall. He scrubs his hair violently with tensed fingers. 
INT. JERRY FABIN'S LIVING ROOM - LATER 
We hear the shower. Steam pours out the open bathroom door. 
EXT. JERRY FABIN'S HOUSE - MID-DAY 
The sun is high; the day is bright and hazy.   A few hippies stroll by or sit on front steps, discreetly smoking joints. We hear the distant sound of Jerry's shower. 
INT. JERRY FABIN'S BATHROOM - LATER 
Jerry is still in the shower, scrubbing away. He finally turns it off and steps out, a drowned rat. He dries himself, wipes the mirror and squints nervously at his reflection. Tiny bugs hop around on his head. He screams. 
INT. JERRY FABIN'S LIVING ROOM - LATER 
Jerry lies on the cruddy shag carpet, open volumes of the Encyclopedia Brittanica spread around him. He scratches himself as he studies one of the volumes. Insects hop up and down all over his body, and on the rug. When he exhales, a cloud of bugs pours from his mouth; he shoos them away. 
EXT. JERRY FABIN'S HOUSE - DAY 
Jerry heads up the walkway carrying a shopping bag. Several cans of Raid and other bug sprays poke out of the bag. Bugs hop around on Jerry. He puts the bag down on the stoop to scratch himself. He notices tiny bugs chewing the shrubs. 
INT. NURSERY - DAY 
Jerry consults with a man behind the cash register. 
NURSERY CLERK Eating the bushes?   Could be aphids. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
JERRY FABIN Aphids! Of course. Y'know, I started with "A" in my cyclopedia, yet somehow I must've skipped right over aphids. It does start with "A", right? Aphids? 
NURSERY CLERK Yes.   Yes, it does, sir. 
JERRY FABIN Yeah they bite! They're aphids! 
CHARLES FRECK Can I wash them off and wait for you? 
Jerry ignores Freck. He scrubs himself intently, ritualistically, totally absorbed in his task. 
INT. LION'S CLUB HALL - DAY 
We hear pronounced, rhythmic breathing, as we scan the hall, which is filled with middle-aged businessmen wearing an array of brightly colored suits. They are well-fed and dull- looking. At the podium is another bussinessman, this one fat in a pink suit and yellow tie. He addresses the assemblage. 
FAT BUSINESSMAN Gentlemen, we have a wonderful opportunity this afternoon. The county of Orange has provided us with the chance to hear from -- and put questions to -- an undercover narcotics agent from the Sheriff's Office. 
The fat businessman gestures with a sweep of his arm toward the camera. 
The heavy breathing stops as we angle on what the fat businessman is gesturing toward: a generic blur of a human being sitting on stage. The blur is clearly human, but it's impossible to settle on its facial features. It's as if the features keep changing. 
FAT BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D) Now you will notice that you can barely see this individual becuase he is wearing what is called a "scramble suit", which he wears during most of his daily activities of law enforcement. Due to potential corruption within the Sheriff's Department, even this gallant officer's co-workers and superiors must not know his "street" identity. 
Heavy breathing. Again we're inside the suit. Now we see, in shadowy profile, the face of the man in the suit. This is Bob Arctor, early thirties, homely, and looking like a druggie. He scans the audience disdainfully. 
BOB ARCTOR (under breath) Nitwits. Pathetic, soulless morons. 
We cut to the outside of the suit -- still expressionless. 
FAT BUSINESSMAN This man -- whom we will call Fred, because that is the code name under which he reports the information he (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
FAT BUSINESSMAN (cont'd) gathers -- cannot be identified by voice or by appearance. He looks, does he not, like a vague blur. This is because his scramble suit projects thousands of different human faces onto your retinas, thus turning Fred into a veritable Everyman. All things to all people translates into nothing to anyone, does it not? 
The fat businessman smiles a big, toothy smile.   The audience of straights smiles back, almost in unison. 
FAT BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D) So let's hear it for our vague blur! 
The audience erupts into enthusiastic applause. Fred rises and replaces the fat businessman behind the podium. When he speaks it is an emotionless computer voice. 
FRED If you saw me on the street, you'd say, "There goes a weirdo freak doper." And you'd feel aversion and walk away. 
The audience is silent, blank, their blankness a reflection of the blankness of Fred's scramble suit. 
FRED (CONT'D) I don't look like you. I can't afford to. My life depends on it. 
Dramatic pause. 
FRED (CONT'D) I am not going to tell you first what I'm attempting to do as an undercover officer. I'm going to tell you... (beat) ... what I am afraid of. 
Now the audience is hooked, their eyes wide. 
We move inside the suit and watch Bob Arctor watching the audience, timing the pause for best effect. We hear the breathing again, and when Arctor speaks, it is in his normal voice, bored, delivering a memorized speech. 
BOB ARCTOR What I fear, is that our children, your children and my children... (pause) (MORE) (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
BOB ARCTOR (cont'd) ... I have two. Little ones. 
QUICK SHOT OF FAMILY PHOTO OF ARCTOR, HIS WIFE, AND TWO LITTLE GIRLS 
The Arctor in the photo is different, conservative, in a colorful suit like the audience members. His wife and kids are smiling and suburban-looking. Their features indistinct, generic, impossible to recall. 
BOB ARCTOR (V.O.) (CONT'D) But not too little to be addicted... 
INT. LION'S CLUB HALL - CONTINUOUS 
Arctor is speaking from inside the suit. 
BOB ARCTOR ... calculatedly addicted, for profit, by those who would destroy this society. We do not yet know who these animals are who pray on our young, but one day we will. 
VOICE FROM CROWD Sock it to 'em! 
The audience concurs.   Bob Arctor sighs disdainfully. 
Outside the suit, the sigh is heard as a computer-like exhalation, uninterpretable, lost on the audience. 
FRED We believe there is one source for Substance D and a diversified distribution system making it accessible in all major drug using areas. It my job as an undercover officer to attain the confidence of low level dealers and work my way up through the network to arrive at the drug's source. Now, the profits for... 
Fred becomes silent, stands there.   The audience waits. 
Inside the suit, Arctor sweats, can't remember his line. He looks, panicked, out at the sea of eyes and finally wings it. 
BOB ARCTOR Well, it isn't the profits anyhow. It's something else... what you see ... 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
Arctor scans the hard audience. He tries a new tack. 
BOB ARCTOR (CONT'D) If you were a diabetic, and you didn't have the money for insulin, would you steal to get the money? Or just die? 
A tinny voice speaks to Arctor through his headphone. 
HEADPHONE VOICE I think you'd better go back to the prepared text, Fred. 
BOB ARCTOR (quietly into throat mike) I forgot it. 
NEW-PATH GIRL Can I help you? 
BOB ARCTOR I'm in a bad place. I wanna turn myself in for treatment. 
INT. FIDDLER'S THREE COFFEE SHOP - DAY 
Charles Freck and Jim Barris sit in a booth. Freck plays distractedly with his glazed doughnut. Barris, in shades, pulls apart his patty melt, inspecting each ingredient. 
CHARLES FRECK Hey, Barris, I'm thinking of turning myself in to New-Path. 
Barris doesn't seem at all interested. 
JIM BARRIS No shit. 
CHARLES FRECK But it's tough, that cold turkey thing they do. They watch you night and day so you don't snuff. But they never give you anything, like a doctor will, like Valium or like that. 
JIM BARRIS Hey, what kind of bread is this on the patty melt, anyway? 
CHARLES FRECK Look on the menu. It explains everything. 
Barris picks up a menu, studies it as he speaks. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
JIM BARRIS If you go into New-Path, you'll experience symptoms that emanate up from the basic fluids of the body, specifically those located in the brain. By that I refer to the catecholamines, such as noradrenaline and serotonin. You see, Substance D functions this way: it interacts with the catecholamines in such a fashion that involement is locked in at a subcellular level. Biological counteradaptation has occurred. (looks up) Nine-grain wheat. 
INT. NEW-PATH - DAY 
Arctor sits in a small room painted institutional green. He holds a styrofoam cup of coffee in his theatrically shaking hands. The New-Path girl stares at him, arms akimbo. Two large impassive guys stand near the door. 
NEW-PATH GIRL You look like hell, mister. 
NEW-PATH GUY #1 Yeah. Like real shit. What you been doing, lying in your own crap? 
NEW-PATH GUY #2 Crap lying in crap. How appropriate. 
INT. FIDDLER'S THREE COFFEE SHOP - DAY 
A cute waitress comes up to Barris and Freck's table. 
WAITRESS So is everything good, fellas? 
Freck becomes panicked, paranoid. He frantically chews some doughnut, tries to appear straight. Barris, in control, signals to Freck that everything is copacetic. 
JIM BARRIS Say, is your name Patty? 
WAITRESS No. (indicates name tag over right breast) It's Beth. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
CHARLES FRECK (under breath, snickering) I wonder what the left one's called. 
WAITRESS I'm sorry, hon? 
CHARLES FRECK No.   Nothing. 
JIM BARRIS The waitress we had last time was named Patty. Same as the sandwich. 
WAITRESS That must have been a different Patty from the sandwich. I think she spells it with an i. 
JIM BARRIS Everything is super good. 
Freck looks over leering Barris's head and sees a thought balloon in which the waitress is stripping off her clothes. 
WAITRESS (IN THOUGHT BALLOON) (moaning) Oh, oh, fuck me, Barris. Fuck me... 
Freck, nervous the waitress will see the balloon, tries to get her attention on him. 
CHARLES FRECK Everything is not good with me. I got a lot of problems nobody else has. 
The waitress looks down sympathetically at Freck. 
WAITRESS Oh, no.   That's too bad. 
JIM BARRIS More people than you think have such problems. This is a world of illness, and getting progressively worse. 
The waitress now looks with some confusion at Barris.   Freck glances nervously at the balloon above Barris's head.   In it the waitress is being fucked from behind by Barris. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
WAITRESS (IN THOUGHT BALLOON) Oh, oh, oooh oh, Barris... 
WAITRESS (smiling) So would you guys like to order dessert? We have fresh peach pie. 
Freck can't take his eyes from the thought balloon. 
CHARLES FRECK No!   No, we don't want any dessert! 
The waitress smiles, nods, and leaves the table.   The thought balloon dissipates. 
CHARLES FRECK (CONT'D) Fruit pies are for old ladies anyway. 
JIM BARRIS (CONT'D) The terminal step I keep to myself, but it involves an intricate methodological process of filtering. 
CHARLES FRECK Even if you do get a gram of coke out of thisl, I can't use it to get into Donna's pants. That's like buying her. 
JIM BARRIS You give her a gift she gives you one. The most precious gift a woman has. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
CHARLES FRECK You're talking about Bob Arctor's girl, Barris. He's my friend and the guy you and Luckman live with. 
JIM BARRIS There's a great deal about Bob Arctor you're not aware of. Your view is simplistic and naive, and you believe about him what he wants you to. 
CHARLES FRECK (defensively) I do not. 
INT. POLICE STATION - DAY 
Frank, in a scramble suit, talks to Hank, also in a scramble suit and studying a clipboard. 
HANK That covers Barris and Freck. Let's see, I guess we can write Jerry Fabin off. 
FRED I read his EEG analysis.    Fabin's over. 
HANK Good riddance. Any luck locating our missing pusher friend Spade Weeks? 
FRED New-Path wouldn't tell me shit. They're very protective of their own. 
HANK Junkies, ex-junkies. It's a club. (flipping through notes) What about Donna Hawthorne? 
FRED I keep pumping her for more and more Death. Pretty soon she'll have to refer me up to her source. 
HANK Fine.   And what's Arctor up to? 
We go inside Fred's suit and see the shadowy face of Arctor. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
BOB ARCTOR Bob Arctor? He's not doing anything much. Working at his nowhere Blue Chip Stamp job, dropping a few tabs of meth cut with Death during the day. 
HANK That's not what I hear. 
Arctor studies the vague blankness of Hank. 
BOB ARCTOR What do you mean? 
HANK We have a tip that Arctor has funds above and beyond what he makes at the stamp redemption center. 
We move outside the suit and see Fred. 
FRED No shit, Hank. Is that true? 
HANK And according to this information, Arctor comes and goes mysteriously. Have you observed any of this? 
FRED Most likely he's with his chick, Donna. 
HANK Most likely?    You're supposed to know. 
FRED Yeah, it's Donna. He's over there banging her day and night. But I'll let you know. So, who's the informant? 
HANK Hell, we don't know. No voice print. He used one of those rinky-dink grids. 
FRED Christ, it's that burned-out acid head Barris doing a schizy grudge job on Arctor's head. I wouldn't give him the time of day as an informant. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
HANK We don't know it's Barris. Anyway, there may be more to Barris than meets the eye. We're looking into him. Nothing I feel would be of use to you, at least so far. 
FRED Well, it's one of Arctor's friends. 
HANK Yeah. Undoubtedly a vengeance burn trip. But we need to know why Arctor's making these kind of enemies. 
FRED Hank, I don't see this as an avenue of 
HANK So I'm taking you off Spade and, for the time being, I'm assigning you primarily to observe Bob Arctor. 
FRED (strangled robot noise) You're assigning me to watch Arctor? 
We move inside Fred's suit and watch an uncomfortable, sweaty Arctor watching Hank. 
HANK Covertly funded, covertly engaged, Fred. It's worth checking into. 
BOB ARCTOR Fine. So I assume this means you'll be bugging Arctor's house and car? 
HANK With the new holographic scanner system. This way you can study Arctor's every move on the tapes, and report back to us in detail. 
Hank, the vague blur, looks up at Fred.   Fred, the vague blur, returns his look. 
FRED Sounds good, then. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
HANK Good. You'll need to get Arctor and the boys away from the house so we can install the equipment. 
BOB ARCTOR (V.O.) (CONT'D) ... my front yard,... 
Arctor, in shorts, appears pushing a lawnmower. 
BOB ARCTOR (V.O.) (CONT'D) ... my power mower. 
INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT 
Arctor sits on the floor bleeding. He looks at his wife and children, their faces somehow becoming more and more vague. 
BOB ARCTOR (V.O.) All the elements that made up my life were right there. And nothing new would ever happen. Like a little plastic boat that would sail on forever, without incident, until it finally sank, which would be a secret relief to all. 
SHOT OF NOTEBOOK DAPPLED WITH SUNLIGHT 
Kids laughing.    Camera skims across these handwritten words: 
BOB ARCTOR (V.O.) (CONT'D) So I ended that life and started this one. Now I dwell in a ugly world... 
INT. ARCTOR'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Present-day druggie Arctor returns to bed with his beer. 
JIM BARRIS (O.S.) This one will be totally soundless. 
There is another extremely loud gunshot. 
EXT. BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS 
Barris studies his silencer, perplexed.   Dogs bark again. 
ERNIE LUCKMAN Jesus, Barris. Y'know, you're supposed to be fixing the cephscope. Bob's lying in his bed right now thinking you're fixing his cephscope. 
INT. ARCTOR'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Arctor lies in bed and writes in his notebook. The voice- over is different here: It's halting, as if he's composing; and it's read with immediacy and anxiety. 
BOB ARCTOR (V.O.) Now I dwell in an ugly... disordered world. But this very disorder... permits... the... unpredictable to -- 
There's a knock on the door.    Arctor slips the notebook under the mattress. 
BOB ARCTOR (CONT'D) Yeah? 
Mumbling outside door.    Arctor fingers the gun under his pillow. 
BOB ARCTOR (CONT'D) Come in, Barris. 
The door opens.    Barris enters, shuffling, smiling, sweating. 
JIM BARRIS Hey, Bob.    I thought you'd be sleeping. 
Barris sits, uninvited, on the edge of Arctor's bed. 
JIM BARRIS (CONT'D) I am here to inform you, Bob, that I have formulated an initial theory as to who may have systematically damaged your cephscope with malice and may do it again. 
Arctor waits.    Barris smiles a shit-eating smile. 
JIM BARRIS (CONT'D) (pointing) You. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
BOB ARCTOR Why the fuck would I screw up my own cephscope? 
JIM BARRIS No, no. You... (points at Arctor) ... are looking at the person who did it. (points at himself) That was my complete, intended statement, which I was not allowed to utter. 
BOB ARCTOR You did it? 
JIM BARRIS I mean it's my theory that I did it. Under post-hypnotic suggestion. With an amnesia block so I wouldn't remember 
BOB ARCTOR Oh, Jesus, Barris. Go fuck yourself. 
Arctor turns away from Barris.   Barris leans in close. 
JIM BARRIS Don't you see, Bob, I've got the advanced, specialized, technical, electronic skills. I have access, because I live here. It all fits. (beat) What I can't figure out is my motive. 
BOB ARCTOR How about, you're a fucked-up lunatic? 
JIM BARRIS I might have been hired by secret forces. It could be as big as that, Bob. As huge as that. 
Arctor reaches under his bed frame and pulls out two tabs of Substance D. He washes them down with beer, closes his eyes. 
BOB ARCTOR Get lost. 
EXT. BOB ARCTOR'S HOUSE - MORNING 
Arctor, Barris, and Luckman emerge from the house, bedraggled and bleary-eyed, and climb into Arctor's car. 
INT. ARCTOR'S CAR - CONTINUOUS 
Arctor starts the car, begins to pull out of the driveway. 
JIM BARRIS Oh, hold on, Bob. I forgot something. I forgot my antihistamine capsules. 
DAN (O.S.) Open the fucking door! 
KIMBERLY (small voice) No.   I'm with someone. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
DAN (O.S.) Fine!   I'll slash your tires! 
Sound of running downstairs. Kimberly rises, and she and Arctor watch out the window as Dan, a skinny, short-haired effeminate-looking guy, appears in the parking lot, crazily waving a knife in the air. 
DAN (screaming up at Kimberly) I'll slash your tires, your fucking tires! And then I'll kill you! 
Dan begins slashing tires on Kimberly's old Dodge. This seems to wake Kimberly up. She shrieks, runs to the door and frantically begins unlocking it. 
KIMBERLY I got to stop him! I don't have insurance! 
Arctor grabs her, tries to hold her back. 
BOB ARCTOR Tires aren't... 
KIMBERLY (struggling to get free) My tires! 
BOB ARCTOR That's what he wants you to do. 
KIMBERLY Downstairs.   They have a phone!   Let me go! 
Kimberly fights loose of Arctor with manic energy. 
KIMBERLY (CONT'D) (unlocking the door) I'm calling the police. My tires! (out the door) One of them is new! 
INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 
Kimberly is scrambling down the stairs. She arrives at an apartment door and pounds on it. Arctor is right behind her. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
KIMBERLY Open, please? Please? I need to call the police. Please let me call them. 
The door opens. An old man in tie and sweater stands there. Kimberly hurries past him, goes for the phone, and dials. 
BOB ARCTOR (to old man) Thank you. 
INT. OLD PEOPLE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 
Arctor enters, closes the door and watches out the peephole. 
KIMBERLY (on phone, crazily) Hi, yeah, my boyfriend and me got into a fight because of these cowboy boots which were worth seven dollars. See, I said, they're mine, and he says, no, they're mine 'cause you gave them to me as a present. And I say but I bought them. Which makes them mine. Right? So he grabs 'em and I grab 'em, and I rip the backs of them with this can opener and... yes, I'll hold. 
Arctor glances at the old man, who's been quietly studying him. An old woman in a print dress stands in the dining room doorway. Kimberly paces on hold, chews a fingernail. 
ARCTOR (to old man) This must be bad on you. 
OLD MAN It goes on all the time, them fighting, him saying he'll kill her. 
OLD WOMAN We should have gone back to Denver.   I told you that. 
OLD MAN These terrible fights. On and on. Smashing things and screaming. And what's worse, every time -- 
OLD WOMAN Yes, tell him about that. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
OLD MAN Every time we go out, shopping or to mail a letter, we step in... what dogs leave. 
OLD WOMAN (whispering) Dog doo. 
INT. ARCTOR'S CAR - DAY 
Arctor drives on the freeway, deep in thought. Luckman's next to him. Barris is in back grinning in his dark shades. 
BOB ARCTOR (V.O.) Dog shit. All that misery and that's what really upset them. 
Arctor chuckles.   The car is behind a crawling Safeway truck. 
ERNIE LUCKMAN You ought to pass that truck, man. The humper's hardly moving. 
Arctor comes back into focus, picks up speed, passes the truck on the left. As he eases up on the gas, the pedal falls to the floor. The car shoots forward at great speed. 
LUCKMAN AND BARRIS Slow down! 
Arctor is panicked. The speedometer is registering eighty- five, ninety, one hundred. Arctor reaches down, tries to fiddle with the gas peddle. The car is rocketing right for a VW van chugging along. Barris and Luckman throw up their hands. Arctor swerves to the left of the van at the last minute. They pass it, but a fast moving Corvette had been about to pass in that lane. It honks, its brakes screech. 
LUCKMAN AND BARRIS (CONT'D) (top of their lungs) What the fuck?! What are you doing?! 
Luckman grabs at the ignition key, and turns it off. Arctor shifts into neutral, the car begins to slow, and he maneuvers it onto the shoulder. The Corvette shoots by, lays on it's horn, continues to do so until it's long gone down the freeway. The three guys just sit in the car, hearts pounding. The VW van passes and honks its VW horn. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
JIM BARRIS What the hell happened, Bob? 
They all look down at the still-depressed gas pedal.     The Safeway truck passes and sounds its own basso horn. 
JIM BARRIS I've got an acquaintance in the field. 
Barris and Luckman look at Arctor. 
ERNIE LUCKMAN We should probably act fast, man. 
JIM BARRIS We don't know how fast they're gonna swoop down on us. 
Arctor studies Barris and Luckman, their anxious eyes bore into him. He sways, gets confused, begins to buy Barris's scenario. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
BOB ARCTOR What reason should we give for selling? 
ERNIE LUCKMAN Yeah, we can't tell the truth. We need a shuck. Barris, what's a good shuck? 
BOB ARCTOR We'll just flat out say there's narcotics planted all over the place and since we don't know where, we decided to move out and let the new owner get busted instead of us. 
JIM BARRIS No. I don't think we can afford to be that up front. Bob, you say you got a job transfer. 
ERNIE LUCKMAN Where to, though? Where the fuck to? 
JIM BARRIS Cleveland. 
BOB ARCTOR I say we tell them the truth. In fact, we can put an ad in the Times: "Modern, three bedroom tract house, two bathrooms for easy flushing, with high grade dope stashed in all rooms." It's a selling point. 
ERNIE LUCKMAN But they'd be calling asking what kind of dope, and we don't know. Man! 
JIM BARRIS Or how much. Prospective buyers might inquire about the quantity. 
BOB ARCTOR (slumps back on the couch) They appear to have us. 
ERNIE LUCKMAN Christ, this is awful! 
Donna appears from one of the bedrooms, rumpled and sleepy. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
DONNA HAWTHORNE Hey, I came in, like the note said.   I waited for you for awhile, then I crashed. Why are you guys yelling? 
The three guys look at each other. 
BOB ARCTOR Did you smoke a joint? Before you crashed? 
DONNA HAWTHORNE Of course. Otherwise I can't sleep. You shouldn't leave your place unlocked like that. You could get ripped off and it would be your own fault. That's the main reason I came in when I saw the note. Somebody ought to be here if the place is unlocked with a note on it. 
BOB ARCTOR How long have you been here? 
ERNIE LUCKMAN Well, you could've taken down the note, locked the door, and left. 
Donna looks at Luckman, trying to figure out what he just said, then back to Arctor. 
DONNA HAWTHORNE Approximately thirty-eight minutes. Hey, Bob, I got that wolf book, if you want to see it. It's got a lot of heavy shit in it. 
Barris falls back into a ratty easy chair. 
JIM BARRIS Life is only heavy and none else; heavy that leads to the grave. For everyone and everything. 
DONNA HAWTHORNE Did you say you were selling the house? Or was that me dreaming? 
BOB ARCTOR Shit, I hope it was you dreaming. 
INT. HANK'S OFFICE - MORNING 
Scramble-suited Hank is unrolling a floor plan labeled "Arctor's House" in front of scramble-suited Fred. 
HANK Here are the locations of the eight scanners. We transmit to a safe house down the block from Arctor's. 
FRED That's where I do playback? 
HANK Yeah. And we use also use it for playback on five other houses. So you'll be bumping into other undercover people. Always wear your scramble suit. 
FRED Fine. 
HANK Make note of the scanner locations. If they need servicing, you can take care of it while you're at Arctor's. As long as nobody's around. 
FRED I'll have to edit myself out, so you won't see who's fixing the scanners. 
HANK Right. Although we assume you're Barris, or Luckman, or Freck, or Arctor or Donna Hawthorne -- 
FRED (computerized chuckle) Donna? 
HANK So don't edit yourself from all tapes, or we'll deduce who you are by process of elimination. Leave yourself in in places. Be creative. Have fun. 
FRED Okay. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
HANK This will help greatly in determining what the hell Arctor's up to. 
FRED We don't know he's up to anything. 
MEDICAL TECHNICIAN #1 A soda pop bottle is correct. 
Medical Technician #1 puts down the card and makes a note on his clipboard. He holds up another card. 
FRED Is this about the Lion's Club speech? 
MEDICAL TECHNICIAN #2 Are you getting cross-chatter, Fred? 
FRED Getting what? 
MEDICAL TECHNICIAN #1 Between the hemispheres. Cross- chatter. 
MEDICAL TECHNICIAN #2 If there's damage to the left hemisphere, where the linguistic skills are normally located, then sometimes the right hemisphere will fill in. 
MEDICAL TECHNICIAN #1 To the best of its limited abilities. 
FRED I don't think I'm getting that. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
MEDICAL TECHNICIAN #2 Thoughts not your own, perhaps? 
MEDICAL TECHNICIAN #1 As if another person were thinking? 
MEDICAL TECHNICIAN #2 Foreign words you don't understand? 
MEDICAL TECHNICIAN #1 You'll keep your eyes open for anything like this, won't you? 
FRED Okay. 
MEDICAL TECHNICIAN #1 Good.     Now what do you see here? 
FRED A sheep. 
MEDICAL TECHNICIAN #1 Show us the sheep, Fred. 
Fred points. 
MEDICAL TECHNICIAN #2 An impairment in set-background discrimination gets you into a heap of trouble -- instead of no forms, you actually perceive faulty forms. 
MEDICAL TECHNICIAN #1 Forms that aren't there. 
MEDICAL TECHNICIAN #2 Like dog shit, for example. 
FRED I'm sorry, what did you say? 
MEDICAL TECHNICIAN #2 I'm sorry, Fred, what? 
FRED Nothing. I'm guessing it's not a sheep. But was I close at least? 
MEDICAL TECHNICIAN #1 This isn't a Rorshach, Fred. There is only one right answer. In this case it's a dog. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
FRED It's what?    What did you say it is? 
MEDICAL TECHNICIAN #1 It's a dog. 
FRED Oh.   How can you tell? 
The technician turns over the card, showing the isolated outline of a greyhound on the other side. 
FRED (CONT'D) Okay. I see it now. What does it mean that I saw a sheep? Does it mean that I'm crazy? 
MEDICAL TECHNICIAN #2 Crazy isn't a psychiatric diagnosis, Fred. 
INT. CHARLES FRECK'S CAR - DAY 
Freck drives along in great spirits. He giggles and plots. 
CHARLES FRECK Okay okay okay. So I go to Barris, "Hey, Barris, I bought a methedrine plant today," and he goes... (childish Barris impersonation) "Methedrine is a benny, like speed, la la la. It's made synthetically in a lab la la la. It isn't organic like pot. There's no such thing as a methedrine plant, like there is a pot plant." Then I go... (big punchline) "I meant I inherited forty thousand dollars from an uncle and purchased a plant in this guy's garage where he makes meth. It's a factory. Plant in that sense... ' Okay okay, I don't have the phrasing exactly yet, but when I lay this on Barris, man, I'm going to get him so good. 
EXT. BOB ARCTOR'S HOUSE - DAY 
Arctor and Barris, in greasy clothes, are in the driveway working on Arctor's car. Freck pulls up, gets out of his car and approaches. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
CHARLES FRECK Hey, Jim, I bought a meth plant today. 
JIM BARRIS How big? 
CHARLES FRECK What do you mean? 
JIM BARRIS How big a plant? 
CHARLES FRECK (confused as to how to proceed) Um, well... like, what do you mean? 
BOB ARCTOR How much you pay, Freck? 
CHARLES FRECK Uh, about ten bucks. 
ERNIE LUCKMAN Teilhard de Chardin. "... that man indeed lives in a zone where no multiplicity can distress him and which is nevertheless the most active workshop of universal fulfillment." (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
Luckman closes the book. He has backed Barris against the wall of the house. Freck tries to get in between them. 
CHARLES FRECK Cool it, you guys. 
ERNIE LUCKMAN Out of the way, Freck. I'm going to coldcock Barris into tomorrow for talking to his betters like that. 
Luckman brings back his arm to punch Barris.    Barris bleats in terror and runs crazily for the house. 
JIM BARRIS I hear the phone ringing about the carb. I'll get it. 
They watch him go. 
ERNIE LUCKMAN I was just kidding. 
CHARLES FRECK What if he comes back with his gun and silencer? 
Arctor and Luckman look dismissively at Freck, and go back under the hood of the car. Freck stands nervously by his car, shifting from foot to foot, ready for a quick getaway. 
CHARLES FRECK (CONT'D) Look, I'm splitting. 
ERNIE LUCKMAN Naw, stay, man, you're a brother. 
CHARLES FRECK Naw, I'm cutting out. 
Barris emerges tentatively from the house, carrying a hammer. 
JIM BARRIS It was a wrong number, man. 
ERNIE LUCKMAN Hey, what's the hammer for, Jimmy-Boy? 
BOB ARCTOR To fix the engine. What else? 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
JIM BARRIS Thought I would bring it with me, since I was indoors and noticed it. 
Freck watches this exchange.    He anxiously climbs in his car. 
CHARLES FRECK I'm gonna split. I'll see you guys. 
BOB ARCTOR The most dangerous kind of person is one who's afraid of his own shadow. 
Freck's eyes widen at this statement.    He drives off. 
INT. FRECK'S CAR - CONTINUOUS 
Freck drives along, sweating. 
CHARLES FRECK Did Bob mean me afraid of my own shadow? But that was turning into a super-bummer. Where's the chicken into not wanting to be around that? Everything's changing, man. Used to be cool to hang out. Now its totally dark. 
Frank slips in his 8-track of Janis Joplin singing "All is Loneliness." He cries as he drives. 
EXT. JERRY FABIN'S HOUSE - DAY 
The furniture has been removed from the lawn. Freck pulls into the driveway and heads to the house. He knocks on the door, waits, sniffling. He knocks again. 
CHARLES FRECK Jerry! Jerry! Let me in, man, I'm truly bummed! I wanna talk! 
A couple of hippies on the stoop next door watch Freck. 
HEAD #1 Hey, Jerry's gone. 
Freck looks over blankly at the hippy.    Then it registers. 
CHARLES FRECK Fuck! I can't believe I forgot Jerry's dead. What is wrong with me? 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
HEAD #1 He's not dead, man. He's in the Number Three Federal Clinic. 
Freck lets this register.   He starts to cry again. 
CHARLES FRECK Fuck, I can't believe I forgot Jerry's not dead. What is wrong with me? 
Freck hurries to his car, speeds down the street. 
INT. ARCTOR'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING 
Arctor, Luckman, and Barris lounge around, stoned.     Arctor seems relaxed, reclining on the couch and glancing discreetly at the hidden holo-scanner. 
ERNIE LUCKMAN You seem mellow, Bob. Having to spend a hundred bucks on a new carb wouldn't make me mellow. 
BOB ARCTOR I'll cruise the streets until I come across an Olds, then unbolt the carb. Like everyone else I know. 
JIM BARRIS Especially Donna. That chick steals everything she can carry. 
ERNIE LUCKMAN I'll tell you a Donna story. One day she put a quarter in a stamp machine and it kept spitting out stamps, till she had like eighteen thousand stamps. 
JIM BARRIS At what individual price per stamp? 
JIM BARRIS The address, the address.      let's see... 
FRED Christ!    Just -- 
Luckman heaves violently on the floor. He thrashes around, throws up the material in his throat, and opens his eyes. 
JIM BARRIS Uh, thank you. No assistance is needed after all. Good morrow. 
Barris hangs up. 
JIM BARRIS (CONT'D) You okay, Ernst? 
ERNIE LUCKMAN I must've gagged. Did I pass out? 
JIM BARRIS Not exactly. You did go into an altered state of consciousness for a few seconds. Probably an alpha state. 
ERNIE LUCKMAN Fuck. I shit myself. 
Luckman stands, unsteadily. Fred relaxes, sits back down at his console. Luckman splashes himself with tap water. 
ERNIE LUCKMAN (CONT'D) What were you doing while I was lying there, jacking off? 
JIM BARRIS You saw me on the phone, summoning the paramedics. I moved into action immedi -- 
ERNIE LUCKMAN Balls. 
EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
Arctor walks home, deep in thought. A MG speeds by, makes a screeching u-turn, pulls up beside Arctor, honks it's horn. Arctor squints inside. It's Donna. He opens the passenger door, gets in. 
INT. DONNA'S CAR - CONTINUOUS 
DONNA HAWTHORNE Did I scare you? Heh heh. 
BOB ARCTOR I just did a freaky number, not like a fantasy trip, but... So I'm kinda -- 
DONNA HAWTHORNE I have your stuff. 
BOB ARCTOR My stuff? 
DONNA HAWTHORNE Your Death. 
Donna screeches off too fast, weaves, tailgates a Coke truck. 
BOB ARCTOR Fucking Barris. You know how he kills you? He doesn't. He waits until a situation arises where you die, and he just sits there. In fact he sets you up to die. I don't know how exactl -- 
DONNA HAWTHORNE Do you have the money? 
BOB ARCTOR What? 
DONNA HAWTHORNE I need the money right now. 
BOB ARCTOR Sure.   Yeah. 
DONNA HAWTHORNE I don't like Barris, and I don't trust him. He's crazy. And you're crazy when you're around him. You're crazy right now. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
BOB ARCTOR I am? 
DONNA HAWTHORNE Yeah. 
BOB ARCTOR Donna, I know I can count on you to tell me if I'm getting weird or crazy or like that. Okay? 
DONNA HAWTHORNE Hey, you wanna take me to a concert at Anaheim Stadium next weekend? 
BOB ARCTOR Right on.     Yeah. That sounds -- 
DONNA HAWTHORNE I'm gonna bring some really oily hash and get really loaded. But you have to wear something neat, not those funky clothes you sometimes wear. 
BOB ARCTOR I'll wear whatever you say. 
DONNA HAWTHORNE I'm taking us to my place. And you do have the money and you'll give it to me. Then we'll drop a few of the tabs and kick back. Maybe you could buy a fifth of Southern Comfort and we could get bombed as well. 
BOB ARCTOR Oh, wow.   That sounds good. 
DONNA HAWTHORNE You know what would be cool tonight, is to go to the Torrance Drive-in. They're showing all eleven Planet of the Apes movies. From 7:30 to 8:00 tomorrow morning. 
BOB ARCTOR Can a drive-in show movies in the morning? 
DONNA HAWTHORNE I haven't seen all the Ape movies in years. And the last one for longer than that, the one where they reveal (MORE) (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
DONNA HAWTHORNE (cont'd) all the famous guys in history, like Nero and Lincoln, were secretly apes... 
INT. DONNA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
It's dark. The door unlocks, light from the hall spills in. Donna enters, flips on the light. There's a trail of newspapers on the floor. 
DONNA HAWTHORNE Stay on the newspaper. I just had the rug shampooed. 
Arctor enters and stands on a square of newspaper. He looks around. The place is cluttered with piles of stuff 
DONNA HAWTHORNE No, you're too ugly. 
BOB ARCTOR What? 
DONNA HAWTHORNE No! Look, I snort a lot of coke; I have to be super careful because I snort a lot of coke. 
BOB ARCTOR Ugly?   Fuck you, Donna. 
DONNA HAWTHORNE Just leave my body alone. 
BOB ARCTOR (putting on his shoes) Sure. Yeah. You better believe it. 
Arctor rises, disappears into the kitchen. 
DONNA HAWTHORNE (calling after) I don't like people to grope my body! (talking to herself) I have to watch out for that because I do so much coke. Someday I'm gonna go over the Canadian border with four pounds of coke in my snatch. I'll say I'm a Catholic and a virgin. 
Arctor passes through the room with his bags of Death. 
BOB ARCTOR I'm taking off. 
He heads for the door.   Donna tries to rise, confused and half asleep. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
DONNA HAWTHORNE You don't have your car. I'll drive you, man. (looks for her shoes) But you can see why I have to protect my snatch -- 
BOB ARCTOR You're too stoned to drive and you never let anyone else drive that little roller skate of yours. 
She jerks upright and glares wildly at him. 
DONNA HAWTHORNE (yelling) That's because no one else can fucking drive my car! Nobody else ever gets it right, no man especially! Driving or anything else! Listen, you had your hands down into my -- 
Arctor is out the door. 
EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
Arctor hurries through the darkness. Donna pants behind him, trying to catch up. She does. Arctor keeps walking. 
DONNA HAWTHORNE I'm dreadfully sorry I hurt your feelings. Okay? I was out of it. 
BOB ARCTOR (muttering) Too ugly. 
DONNA HAWTHORNE Sometimes I get really spaced. You wanna come back? Or what? You wanna go to the drive-in? What about the Southern Comfort? C'mon, I'm sorry. 
Arctor stops, stares off for a while.   Donna watches, waits. 
BOB ARCTOR Okay. 
They turn and head back to the house. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
DONNA HAWTHORNE That sure is good hash though, huh? 
They walk in silence. 
DONNA HAWTHORNE You know what I'm going to do someday, Bob? I'm going to move north to Oregon and live in the snow. Have a little house and a vegetable garden. 
BOB ARCTOR You'll have to save up for that. 
DONNA HAWTHORNE (glancing up shyly) He'll get me that. What's-his-name. 
BOB ARCTOR Who? 
DONNA HAWTHORNE (sharing a secret) Mr. Right. He'll drive an Aston- Martin and take me north in it. And that's where the little old fashioned house will be in the snow. 
BOB ARCTOR You sure this'll happen? 
DONNA HAWTHORNE It's in the cards. 
A heaviness descends upon Arctor.    He stops.   Donna stops. 
BOB ARCTOR Hey, man, can I go with you? To Oregon? When you do take off finally? 
Donna smiles up at Arctor. She gently shakes her head "no." He studies her. Her answer will never change. He shivers. Donna takes Arctor's hand, squeezes it, holds it. Her touch fills him. After a moment, Donna lets her hand drop. 
INT. ARCTOR'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Arctor enters the dimly lit bedroom followed by Connie, a skinny girl with hollow eyes and a flat affect. He sifts through his dresser drawer as she hovers behind him. Finally he pulls out a baggie with some pills in it. Throughout, we hear stoned conversation coming from another room. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
BOB ARCTOR Here you go. 
CONNIE Thanks, man. 
Connie stuffs the baggie into her purse. She sits on the bed and begins to unceremoniously undress. When her blouse comes off, we see needle tracks and bruises on her arms. She pulls a comb from her purse and listlessly combs her lank hair. She drops the hand holding the comb and begins to nod. Arctor looks at the tracks, at the pimple on her cheek. Connie wakes up, sort of, and starts combing again. 
CONNIE (CONT'D) (mumbling) Do you have a toothbrush I can use. Aw screw it -- teeth are teeth. I'll brush 'em. You gotta ... 
Connie drones on, but her voice has become so quiet it can't be heard. Arctor watches her lips work soundlessly. Finally her voice becomes audible again. 
JIM BARRIS Yes. About that, Bob. I've already ordered resistors -- 
Fred fast-forwards again. Now Barris is on the living room monitor reading about mushrooms and Arctor is on the monitor in his bedroom, writing in his notebook. The phone rings on the living room monitor. Barris picks up. 
JIM BARRIS (CONT'D) Yeah? 
TELEPHONE VOICE #3 Mr. Arctor? 
JIM BARRIS Yes, this is Robert Arctor. 
Inside the Fred scramble suit we see Arctor's eyes widen. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
TELEPHONE VOICE #3 I'm sorry to bother you, Mr. Arctor, but your check did not clear. 
JIM BARRIS Oh, yes, I've been meaning to call you, but I've had a severe bout of intestinal flu, with loss of body heat, pyloric spasms, cramps... 
In the monitor in his bedroom, Arctor continues to write in his notebook, unaware. In his scramble suit at the console, Bob Arctor, is freaked out, and writes in the same notebook. 
BOB ARCTOR (V.O.) Barris portraying Arctor as coming off heroin. 
JIM BARRIS I just haven't been able to get it together to make that little twenty dollar check good, and frankly I don't intend to make it good. 
BOB ARCTOR (IN SCRAMBLE SUIT) What? 
TELEPHONE VOICE #3 What? 
JIM BARRIS You heard me correctly. 
TELEPHONE VOICE #3 Mr. Arctor, those flu symptoms you describe... I think you're a -- 
JIM BARRIS Think what you want. Turn out, tune out, and good-bye. 
Barris hangs up.   Fred checks the LED, picks up his phone. 
FRED Get me a name and address on this. 
OPERATOR Englesohn Locksmith, 1343 Harbor in Anaheim, Loverboy. 
Fred hangs up. We move inside the suit to Arctor's troubled face. He writes in his notebook. The V.O. is disturbed. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
BOB ARCTOR (V.O.) Barris up to something: pretending to be me... writing rubber checks on my account... representing me as a heroin addict. BUT WHAT IS HE UP TO? 
INT. SAFE HOUSE - A FEW MINUTES LATER 
Fred paces. He passes a wall mirror, glances at his vague face. He moves closer to the mirror, studies himself. 
FRED Arctor must've burned Barris pretty bad to deserve this display of malice. 
Scramble Suit #1 approaches Fred. 
SCRAMBLE SUIT #1 I was thinking, do you actually know these losers? Are you in among them? 
FRED Yeah.   I'm there. 
SCRAMBLE SUIT #1 You might want to warn them about the mushrooms. Can you pass it on to them without faulting your cover? 
FRED I suppose I can lay it on that one. (indicates Arctor) Without him flashing on me. He's docile. 
SCRAMBLE SUIT #1 Ugly-looking, too. 
Scramble Suit #1 laughs.   Fred joins in wholeheartedly. 
INT. SAFE HOUSE - LATER 
Fred watches the monitors. Arctor's house is quiet. Barris and Luckman doze in the living room, the television tuned to static. On another monitor, Arctor is sleeping in his bed with a woman. After a beat Fred notices the woman is Donna. We move in close to Fred's ever-changing eyes. 
FRED That can't be right. Arctor has never done it with Donna. Has he? 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
Fred fast-rewinds the tape, switches it to play. Arctor is in bed having sex with Connie. Fred sighs a computerized sigh of relief and fast-forwards the tape. Arctor is now sleeping next to Connie. Fred watches for a moment. As he does the face of the sleeping woman transforms into Donna's. Fred freezes the frame. Then he enlarges the holographic image so it fills up the space previously occupied by all eight monitors. The image is now almost actual size. Fred rises and walks around the console into the projection area. It's as if he's entering Arctor's bedroom, or a slightly scaled down, frozen version of it. He approaches the sleeping couple, bends down and examines the face of the woman. It is clearly Donna. He stands in Arctor's bedroom for a while, confused and disoriented, tries to look at himself in Arctor's bureau mirror. Fred does not appear in the holographic reflection of the room. He shudders, returns to the console, brings up all eight monitors, and turns off the freeze-frame. On the bedroom monitor, Arctor awakens, and glances over at the woman sleeping next to him. His eyes widen. He fumbles for the switch on the bedside lamp, knocks it over. He turns back and stares at the sleeping woman. As does Fred at the console. 
EXT. ENGLESOHN LOCK COMPANY - MORNING 
A yellow cab pulls up.     Arctor emerges. 
INT. ENGLESOHN LOCK COMPANY - CONTINUOUS 
A plump old lady stands behind the counter.    Arctor enters. 
OLD LADY Yes sir?   Good morning. 
BOB ARCTOR Hi, I'm here... 
The scene shifts to very slow motion. Everything grows quiet. Colors become saturated, as in a Raphael painting. 
FAR-AWAY VOICE Ihr Instrumente freilich spottet mein/Mit Rad und Kammen, Walz' und Bugel:/Ich stand am Tor, ihr... The scene shifts back.     Maybe a hiccup's worth of time has passed. 
OLD MAN (V.O.) Let me talk to him. 
OLD LADY (V.O.) Mr. Arctor? It says here it was in Santa Ana. On Main Street. 
EXT. PARTY HOUSE - NIGHT 
Arctor is stoned and on the phone in the crowded, smokey, noisy room. A blonde woman nibbles his ear. 
BOB ARCTOR Yeah, I lost my ignition key. (pause) 34881 Main Street, Santa Ana... 
EXT. SHELL STATION - MORNING 
Arctor hangs up the pay phone.   He paces, trying to think. 
BOB ARCTOR So, Arctor's the forger, not Barris! Not deliberately, but because his brain is slushed on dope. All their brains are... 
The busy intersection slows almost to a standstill. Colors become saturated. Details seem momentous: A man gesturing in mid-conversation, a newspaper blowing down the street. 
FAR-AWAY VOICE Der wurme gleich' ich, der den Staub Durchwuhlt,/Den, wie er sich im Staube nahrend lebt,/Des Wandrers Tritt... Back to normal as a car passes with a faulty muffler. 
BOB ARCTOR ... slushed and mutually interacting in a slushed way. 
INT. CAB - MORNING 
Arctor rides in the back. He stares out the window at the endless loop of McDonald's, Thriftys, 7-11's. 
BOB ARCTOR (V.O.) But what is Arctor up to? Clearly the Sheriff's Office has some good reasons to focus their investigation on him. No doubt reasons I know nothing about. My job is to report, theirs to evaluate. 
Arctor lets his head fall back against the seat. 
EXT. ARCTOR'S HOUSE - MORNING 
The cab drops Arctor off. He heads up the newspaper-strewn walk to the front door. He eyes the house and the grounds: The house needs paint, a rain gutter is halfway dislodged. The yard is overgrown. 
BOB ARCTOR Fucking waste of a perfectly good house. A family could live here, for Christ's sake. (picks up newspapers) Oughta take it away from this fuck. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
Arctor arrives at the front door, tries to pull his house keys from his pocket without spilling the armful of newspapers. He succeeds, opens the door, enters the house. 
INT. ARCTOR'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
The place is a mess.    Arctor drops the papers on the floor. 
BOB ARCTOR (for benefit of scanners) Nobody home, I guess. 
Arctor moves through the room in an almost studied way. There is something stilted about the way he intentionally avoids looking in the direction of the scanner. 
SHOT OF NOTEBOOK DAPPLED WITH SUNLIGHT 
Kids playing in background. The camera glides across the following words as the dispassionate V.O. reads along. 
BOB ARCTOR (V.O.) (CONT'D) What does a scanner see? Does it see into the head? Into the heart? Does it see into me clearly or darkly? I hope clearly, because I can't any longer. I see only murk inside and out. 
INT. ARCTOR'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Arctor rises and pulls a book from the shelf. It is The Picture Book of Sexual Love. He opens the book, revealing a photo of a man nibbling a woman's breast. He positions himself so as to be best picked up by the living room scanner,then appears to read aloud from the book. We can see that what he is reciting is not on the page. 
BOB ARCTOR Any given man sees only a tiny portion of the total truth, and... 
Shift to slow motion.    Saturated colors.    Very quiet. 
FAR-AWAY VOICE Weh! steck' ich in dem Kerker... INT. CHARLES FRECK'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Freck lays fresh sheets on his bed in his neat apartment. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
CHARLES FRECK It is no problem how to kill yourself in the circles in which I hang. When life becomes more and more depressing as you watch those you know falling apart from drug use, just take a large quantity of reds. 
Freck places a bag of reds on the night table. 
CHARLES FRECK Wash 'em down with a bottle of cheap wine. 
Freck pulls a bottle of Thunderbird from the counter of his kitchenette and places it next to the pills. 
CHARLES FRECK (CONT'D) The hard part is choosing the correct artifacts to be found on you by later archaeologists. So they know from which stratum you came and where your head was at when you did it. 
Freck pulls a copy of "The Fountainhead" from his book shelf, and places it face down and open on his bed. 
CHARLES FRECK (CONT'D) I will be found with Ayn Rand's "The Fountainhead" open by my side to prove I have been a misunderstood superman rejected by the masses and so, in a sense, murdered by their scorn. 
Freck places a typewritten letter next to the book. 
CHARLES FRECK (CONT'D) Also, an unfinished letter to Exxon protesting the cancellation of my gas credit card. That way I will indict the system and achieve something by my death. Over and above what the death itself achieves. 
Freck lies on the bed and readies himself for the suicide. He unscrews the cap on the wine, tastes it, reconsiders. 
CHARLES FRECK (CONT'D) Perhaps a connoisseur wine is in order on such an auspicious occasion. 
INT. CHARLES FRECK'S CAR - DAY 
ERNIE LUCKMAN The kids wouldn't believe that either. 
BOB ARCTOR Kids never believe anything anymore. 
Fred's phone rings. It jerks him out of his focus on the monitor. He pauses the tape and picks up the phone. 
FRED Yeah? 
TELEPHONE VOICE Fred, we've processed your tests. We need you to come back for the full battery. Tomorrow at three. Do you remember the room number? 
FRED Um... okay. 
TELEPHONE VOICE It's 203. Are you all right, Fred? Any confusion? Difficulty identifying persons or objects? Does anything you see appear inverted or reversed? Any space-time or language disorientation? 
FRED Um, what?   I just... what exactly have you processed... that is, is this in regard to the Lion's Club speech? 
TELEPHONE VOICE We'll take all that up tomorrow, Fred. 
Dial tone. Fred hangs up and fast-forwards the tape. He watches as the tape whirs through the machine. He presses stop, the tape jerks to a halt. Fred breathes hard, although it comes through the grid sounding oddly mechanical. He pushes play. Luckman is cleaning grass on the floor. Barris is in the corner winding string. Arctor rubs his finger on the lip of a wine glass, making it hum. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
ERNIE LUCKMAN ... this guy appeared on tv, claiming to be a world-famous imposter. He said he'd posed at one time or another as a great surgeon, a theoretical submolecular high-velocity particle research physicist, a Finnish novelist, a deposed president of Argentina... 
BOB ARCTOR He got away with it? Never got caught? 
ERNIE LUCKMAN See, the guy never really posed as any of it. He only posed as a world- famous imposter. Turns out he just pushed a broom at Disneyland, until he read about this actual world-famous imposter, and he thought, I can pose as all those things, then he thought, hell, I'll just pose as an imposter. Save a lot of time, a lot easier. Made almost as much money as the real imposter with books and movie rights. 
JIM BARRIS We see imposters in our lives, now and then. But not posing as physicists. 
ERNIE LUCKMAN Narks, you mean. Yeah, I wonder what a nark looks like? 
BOB ARCTOR It's like asking what an imposter looks like. I asked a hash dealer who'd been busted once what the nark who busted him looked like -- 
JIM BARRIS Looked just like us. 
BOB ARCTOR More so. The dealer dude told me the nark had longer hair than we do. I guess the moral is, stay away from guys who look like us. 
ERNIE LUCKMAN Narks give me the creeps. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
BOB ARCTOR How could a guy do that is what I want to know, pose as a nark? 
LUCKMAN AND BARRIS What? 
BOB ARCTOR Shit, I'm spaced. Pose as a nark. 
ERNIE LUCKMAN POSE AS A NARK? POSE AS A NARK? 
BOB ARCTOR My brains are scrambled today.      I better go crash. 
Fred freezes the tape.   He scribbles in notebook. 
SHOT OF NOTEBOOK 
Fred writes in a different handwriting now: choppy, backward- slanted, crabbed. 
FRED (V.O.) Posing as a nark. What does Arctor mean? 
INT. CHARLES FRECK'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Freck sits up in bed in his now electric yellow room, sipping magenta wine. The walls are dripping. 
CHARLES FRECK I've been burned. These are not reds, but rather some freaky psychedelic, the likes of which I have never seen. 
The wall across from Freck's bed parts with a sloshing sound, and an eight foot high creature with many eyes and ultra-hip clothing appears at his bedside, holding a scroll. 
CHARLES FRECK (CONT'D) Fuck. You're going to read me my sins, aren't you? 
The creature nods solemnly and unrolls the scroll. 
CHARLES FRECK (CONT'D) And it's going to take a hundred thousand million hours, isn't it? 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
CREATURE We are no longer in the mundane universe. Your sins will be read to you ceaselessly throughout eternity. 
CHARLES FRECK Know your fucking dealer, man. 
CREATURE (reading from scroll) November 14, 1962, 3:08:23 pm: you did knowingly and with malice aforethought punch your baby sister Evelyn on the left side of the head when your mother was not looking. November 14, 1962, 3:08:27 pm: you did knowingly and with malice aforethought punch your baby sister on the left arm when your mother was not looking. November 14, 1962, 3:08:32 pm: you did... 
EXT. BOB ARCTOR'S FRONT YARD - DAY 
Arctor is finishing up mowing the lawn. He is intently focused on the task, but has done an erratic job: the left side of the yard has been left almost completely unmowed. Arctor turns to enter the house. We see that the left side of his face is completely unshaved. 
INT. ROOM 203 - DAY 
Fred is in the midst of a battery of tests being administered by two uniformed medical technicians who resemble the technicians who administered the previous tests, but are not the same. Fred's head rests in a contraption that divides his face in half, so his right eye and left eye can be exposed to different projected images. 
MEDICAL TECHNICIAN #3 Okay, Fred, in rapid succession you will see a number of objects pass before first you left eye, then your right eye. At the same time, on the panel before you, outlines of these objects will appear. You are to match, by means of the punch pencil you hold in your hand, the outline with the object. These images will flash very quickly so don't hesitate too long. You will be scored for time as well as accuracy. Okay? 
JIM BARRIS When you examine my evidence, you will undoubtedly conclude that Substance D is produced by a foreign nation determined to overthrow the U.S., and (MORE) (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
JIM BARRIS (cont'd) that Robert Arctor has his hands deep in the machinery of -- 
HANK Can you tells us the name of anyone else inside this organization? 
JIM BARRIS A Miss Donna Hawthorne. On various pretexts he goes over to her place and colludes with her regularly. 
Fred laughs his computerized laugh.      Barris laughs also. 
FRED Colludes?    What do you mean? 
JIM BARRIS I've followed him in my car, sir. 
FRED She's his girl! 
HANK (to Fred) You think there's nothing to this? 
FRED (shrugging) Let's look at his evidence. 
HANK (to Barris) Bring us your evidence. (to Fred) Maybe we should send an officer with him to retrieve it. 
JIM BARRIS There's one more thing. Mr. Arctor is addicted to Substance D. His mind is deranged now. He's become dangerous. 
FRED Dangerous. 
JIM BARRIS He's already having episodes such as occur with brain damage from Substance D. Deterioration in the corpus callosum. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
HANK This kind of unsupported speculation is worthless. We'll send an officer with you to collect your evidence. 
JIM BARRIS But, sirs -- 
HANK We'll arrange for an officer out of uniform, so it won't be conspicuous. 
JIM BARRIS I might be murdered. Mr. Arctor is, as I say -- 
HANK We appreciate your extreme risk, Mr. Barris. If your information is of significant value in obtaining a conviction, then naturally -- 
JIM BARRIS That's not why I'm doing this. The man is sick. Brain damaged from Substance D. The reason I am here -- 
HANK We don't care why you're here. We only care if your evidence amounts to anything. The rest is your problem. 
JIM BARRIS Thank you, sirs. Thank you very much. 
Barris grins and nods and sweats. 
INT. ROOM 203 - DAY 
Fred enters. Medical Technician #1 and Medical Technician #2 look up from their desks. 
MEDICAL TECHNICIAN #1 Fred, is that you? 
FRED Yes. 
MEDICAL TECHNICIAN #1 Have a seat, then. 
Fred sits in a chair against the wall. The technicians go back to their paper work. Fred waits stiffly. Finally, Medical Technician #2 looks back up. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
MEDICAL TECHNICIAN #2 Fred, we've processed your results. 
FRED Uh-huh. 
MEDICAL TECHNICIAN #2 You demonstrate something we call a competition phenomenon. 
FRED (getting up to leave) Okay. Thank you. 
Medical Technician #2 gestures for Fred to sit.         He does. 
MEDICAL TECHNICIAN   #2 It's a competition between your   left and right hemispheres. Kind of    like you have two gas gauges on your   car, one says your tank is full, the   other says it's empty. 
FRED Why do I have two gas gauges? 
MEDICAL TECHNICIAN #2 Substance D. Damage has taken place in the normally dominant left hemisphere. The right hemisphere is attempting to compensate for the impairment. But the twin functions do not fuse. Now, we could perform a right hemispherectomy -- 
FRED Will these go away?    These gas gauges? 
MEDICAL TECHNICIAN #1 It's probably a functional impairment. 
MEDICAL TECHNICIAN #2 It may be organic. Maybe permanent. 
FRED Wait. I'm confused.    Are you saying it is organic, or -- 
MEDICAL TECHNICIAN #1 Even if it's brain damage, there are experiments now in the removal of small sections of both hemispheres which seem to abort compete gestalt- processing. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
MEDICAL TECHNICIAN #2 But the problem then is the individual only receives partial incoming sense data. Instead of having two signals, he gets half a signal. 
FRED Half a gas gauge?      What would that be like? 
INT. HANK'S OFFICE - DAY 
She ignores him and heads back on foot to the exit ramp, squinting into the headlights of the oncoming traffic. 
FADE TO BLACK. 
FADE IN: 
INT. NEW-PATH - DAY 
George, a staff member, addresses the camera as he leads it down a dormitory hallway. 
GEORGE All right, Bruce, what you'll be doing here first is the bathrooms. 
George stops at a closet door, opens it, and pulls out a mop, pail, and some powdered soap. He closes the door, and continues down the hall. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) The floors, the basins, and especially the toilets. There are three bathrooms, one on each floor. Okay, Bruce? 
Angle on Bruce. We see that Bruce is Bob Arctor. It is, however, a different Arctor: hair cut short and unstylish, nondescript Goodwill clothing, and a mousy demeanor. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
BOB ARCTOR Okay. 
George pushes open another door and enters.       Arctor follows. 
INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Arctor and George stand in a dorm-style bathroom, with several toilets. George hands the mop and pail to Arctor. 
GEORGE You feel you know how to clean a bathroom?   Start, and I'll give you some pointers. 
Arctor nods obediently, takes the pail to the sink, sprinkles in some soap flakes, and begins to fill it with water. He becomes transfixed with the foam forming in the pail and the roar of the running water. After a while, George speaks, sounding very far away. 
GEORGE (O.C.) Don't fill it all the way, Bruce, or you won't be able to lift it. 
BOB ARCTOR Okay. 
INT. LOUNGE - DAY 
Arctor sits with a paper cup of coffee. There are others in the lounge, but they pay him no attention. He stares down at his coffee, focused on the rising and swirling steam. Jabbering is heard in the background. 
NEW-PATH RESIDENT #1 If you could see from inside a dead person, you could still see, but you couldn't operate the eye muscles so you couldn't focus. 
NEW-PATH RESIDENT #2 Exactly.   Just blurry. 
NEW-PATH RESIDENT #1 Plus, you couldn't turn your head or your eyeballs. All you could do is wait and wait until some object passed by. It'd be a terrible scene. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
NEW-PATH RESIDENT #2 I think that's what it means to be dead. To not be able to stop looking at whatever's in front of you. 
INT. MEETING ROOM - AFTERNOON 
Arctor sits on a folding chair in a semi-circle of residents and a staff member. He stares down at his hands. A portable blackboard is covered with scribbled words, such as "Goals", "Responsibility", and "Community." A large coffee urn percolates in the corner, making a "whoop-whoop" sound. Arctor focuses on this sound, which frightens him. 
NEW-PATH RESIDENT #3 Living and unliving things are exchanging properties. 
All murmer agreement except Arctor, who just looks down. 
NEW-PATH RESIDENT #4 That's because the drive of the unliving is stronger than the drive of the living. 
Whoop-Whoop.    The coffee urn gets progressively louder. 
NEW-PATH STAFFER So we are incorporating too much unliving drive within us. Now, activity does not necessarily mean life. Quasars are active, but not alive. A meditating monk is not dead. 
INT. DINING HALL - NIGHT 
The room is filled with sad-looking people at collapsible tables eating dinner off trays. Arctor sits at a table by himself, and stares down at his steaming soup. 
INT. RECEPTION AREA - DAY 
A bunch of residents excitedly rifle through a cardboard box of donated clothing. Arctor stands back from the box and look at his feet. Mike, a short, stocky man with a pug face slips into a shirt that looks like an American flag. 
NEW-PATH RESIDENT #1 Hey, Mike, you're one sharp dude! 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
MIKE Thanks, man. 
Mike fiddles with a belt with two metal rings for a buckle. He can't cinch it. 
MIKE (CONT'D) (cheerily) Oh, c'mon, you guys left me the belt nobody else could work! (to Arctor) You know how to do this, man? 
Arctor reaches down and cinches the belt. 
MIKE (CONT'D) Hey, thanks, buddy! 
Mike touches Arctor's shoulder.    Arctor glances at the hand. 
INT. MEETING ROOM - MORNING 
Arctor sits in the center of the room. A circle of residents yell at him. A Chinese girl is more shrill than the others 
INT. NEW-PATH RECEPTION AREA - DAY 
Arctor sits on a folding chair against the wall, staring at his cup of coffee. Mike walks by in his bright new shirt. 
MIKE Hey, Bruce! 
Arctor looks up. 
BOB ARCTOR Are you leaving here? 
MIKE (chuckling) No, man, I can never leave   here. Too many temptations out there   for the likes of us. No, I'm just    going into town to pick up a donation   of semi- rotten vegetables. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
BOB ARCTOR Semi-rotten vegetables. 
SHOT OF NOTEBOOK DAPPLED WITH SUNLIGHT 
kids laughing in background.    We scan the following words, read offhandedly by Arctor. 
BOB ARCTOR (V.O.) For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part... 
The camera pulls back to reveal that it's Donna reading the journal. She's sitting at a picnic table outside a McDonald's. Her eyes move back and forth across the page. Near her, a group of children laugh and play on a McDonaldland jungle gym. 
BOB ARCTOR (V.O.) (CONT'D) ...but then shall I know even as also I am known. 
That's the last entry. She closes the notebook, takes a sip of Coke, and watches the children play. A pick-up truck pulls into the parking lot. Mike gets out, approaches Donna's table, sits across from her. There's a silence, then: 
DONNA HAWTHORNE So are they paranoid about him? 
MIKE No. He just sits there all day. There's really nothing to suspect. They can't get anything out of him during the game sessions. 
Donna looks off for a moment, sadly. 
DONNA HAWTHORNE Well, then, will he be able to act, when the time comes? Is anything left? 
MIKE You never really know. A memory. A few charred brain cells flicker on. People like him are clacking insects. All reflex. We can only hope he's got the right reflex. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
DONNA HAWTHORNE It was very well drilled into him. (forlorn) Such a price to pay. The government asks an awful lot. 
MIKE Life asks an awful lot. 
DONNA HAWTHORNE (angry) In this case, the fucking government. Bob didn't volunteer. He was sacrificed. He was my friend, y'know. (beat) I don't want to be on this assignment much longer. I just want it over. Shit. Sometimes I think we're colder than they are. 
MIKE I see a warm person when I look at you, Donna. 
DONNA HAWTHORNE Oh, I'm warm on the outside. Warm face, warm eyes, warm fucking fake smile. But inside I'm cold all the time. I am full of lies. I am awful. 
Donna gets up and walks away.    Mike watches after her. 
INT. NEW-PATH HALLWAY - DAY 
Arctor opens the door to the room where he first saw the children. In there now is an old woman trying to juggle. She smiles at Arctor and he sees that she has almost no teeth. 
OLD WOMAN Can you do this? 
She throws the balls in the air to juggle and they fall back onto her then bounce onto the floor. She stoops over, spitting and laughing. Arctor is dismayed. 
BOB ARCTOR I can't do that. 
OLD WOMAN I can. 
She tries again, fails, laughs. A staffer appears next to the Arctor in the doorway, sniffs the air 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
NEW-PATH STAFFER Donna, you need to clean yourself. You stink. 
BOB ARCTOR (horrified) Donna?! 
The old woman shuffles past Arctor and the staffer. 
BOB ARCTOR How long has Donna been here? 
NEW-PATH STAFFER I don't know. Six months. 
BOB ARCTOR (relieved) Oh, then it's not Donna. I've been here a week. And Donna drove me here. And she was fine: sad-eyed, quiet and composed. So beautiful. Leather jacket. That purse with the rabbit's foot dangling. Just like always. 
INT. LOUNGE - DAY 
Arctor and Mike sit across from each other over coffee. 
MIKE I think I'm going to try to get you a job on one of our farms, Bruce. When you're ready. 
BOB ARCTOR Can I work with animals. I like animals. Can I work with them? 
MIKE No, I want to try you with crops.    I think that'd be good for you. 
BOB ARCTOR I want to work with something living.

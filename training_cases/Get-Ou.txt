GET OUT 
Written by 
Jordan Peele 
I appeal to you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship. Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect. -Romans 12:1-2 
EXT. THE SHAW'S HOUSE - FRONT LAWN - NIGHT 
A perfect suburban house with bay windows and a front lawn. The SHAW family. Caucasian and warm - RICHARD, 34; NANCY, 30; JOSHUA, 6; and MAY, 4 - eat dinner inside. Richard reads something on his tablet illuminating his face. 
JOSHUA Which one are we going to? 
RICHARD The one in Orlando. 
NANCY Disney World. 
JOSHUA Tony said that Mickey is not really Mickey; it's someone else in there. 
RICHARD Mickey's Mickey. 
EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT 
ANDRE, 29, an African-American man runs down the sidewalk in sweats. He listens to jazz on his phone. The music stops. He stops running and checks his phone. 
ANDRE Damn. 
He's right in front of the Shaw's house. He glances inside. The Shaw's seem normal and content. Andre smiles. 
A motion detecting security light floods the lawn. 
INT. THE SHAW'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Richard looks up from his table to see Andre standing there. The rest of the family doesn't notice. Nancy tends to May, who SQUIRMS in her chair. Richard watches Andre protectively. 
JOSHUA Also, Tony said he saw a chef Mickey and a normal Mickey. 
NANCY He must have changed his clothes for work. 
EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - CONTINUOUS 
Andre walks on. It's getting dark. He is suddenly very alone. 
A vintage creme-colored Porsche Boxter with tinted windows and a roof CREEPS up on the street behind Andre. It's following him. 
INT. SPORTS CAR - CONTINUOUS 
Driver's POV watching Andre. His BREATH ECHOES deep and tinny as if it were into a coffee can. Through the car's system we hear an English to French language tutorial recording. 
TUTORIAL Pardon me. Where is the nearest restaurant? Pardonnez-moi. Ou est le restaurant le plus proche? 
The driver doesn't repeat. 
EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - CONTINUOUS 
Andre, feeling followed, stops to tie his shoe. The car also stops. Andre waves at the unseen DRIVER. There is no response. The ENGINE PURRS. 
Andre begins walking again. The car begins slowly too. Andre stops again. The car does too. Andre peers through the windshield but can't see through the tint. 
ANDRE Can I help you...? 
No response. 
ANDRE (CONT'D) I'm new to the area. I just moved here... Down on Evergreen... 
Nothing. Did I do something wrong? 'Cause-- 
INT. SPORTS CAR - CONTINUOUS 
Driver's POV. Andre continues to talk, but isn't heard. 
TUTORIAL Can you show me the nearest bathroom? Pouvez-vous me montrer la salle de bain la plus prouche?

"GET OUT" 
EXT. BROOKLYN PARK SLOPE - DAWN 
The sun rises over the city. Autumn. Beautiful. 
INT. BROOKLYN LOFT - LIVING ROOM - MORNING 
We move slowly through the small but clean apartment. The walls are decorated with fascinating urban photography. 
INT. BROOKLYN LOFT - BATHROOM - MORNING 
CHRIS WASHINGTON, 26, a handsome African-American man shuts the medicine cabinet. He's shirtless and naturally athletic. He scrutinizes his reflection with a touch of vanity. 
INT. STARBUCKS COUNTER - MORNING 
ROSE ARMITAGE, 28 - Caucasian, brunette with freckles - cool and beautiful like an old Summer Camp crush. Rose looks at pastries through the glass. She can't help but smile. 
INT. BROOKLYN LOFT - BATHROOM - MORNING 
Chris spreads shaving cream onto his face and shaves. He postures a little then nicks himself on the neck. He smirks; deserved that. 
INT. BROOKLYN LOFT - LIVING ROOM - MORNING 
Chris, clothed, looks out his window through a professional camera. He flips through some striking urban images on the digital display much like the ones framed around his apartment. He is a very talented photographer. 
Sid, a small black dog, watches him. The BUZZER RINGS. 
INT. BROOKLYN BUILDING - HALLWAY. MORNING 
Chris opens the door. Rose stands outside the apartment with her hands full. She has two coffees and two bags of pastries. Chris smirks. 
ROSE I couldn't decide... 
He takes the coffee tray and pulls her inside. They kiss. 
INT. BROOKLYN LOFT - LIVING ROOM - MORNING 
Rose and Chris have coffee and sweets by the window. The small mound of pastries sits on the coffee table. SID lays on her lap. She strokes him. It's a perfect morning. 
ROSE Poor thing. Do you even pet him? 
CHRIS Are you kidding me? When you're not here that dog gets the best fuckin' pets of his life. 
ROSE So, how come whenever I come over, he acts like he's been totally neglected. 
CHRIS `Cause he know he's got you wrapped around his little paw. 
ROSE oh, really? 
CHRIS Yeah. 
Chris picks up her foot sweetly and massages it. She melts. 
INT. BROOKLYN LOFT - CHRIS' BEDROOM - DAY 
Chris packs a small bag of luggage. Rose lays on the bed. 
ROSE Toothbrush... Deodorant... 
CHRIS Check... Check.... 
Chris puts a cigarette in his mouth. Rose pops up and grabs the cigarette from his mouth and breaks it. Chris tries to feign incredulousness but is amused. 
CHRIS (CONT'D) I'm not gonna have one the whole weekend. 
ROSE You quit, remember? 
CHRIS I'm nervous. 
ROSE Why? They're going to love you. 
INT. ROSE'S CAR - DAY 
Rose hums. Chris, in the passengers seat, looks through his camera at the passing trees. He snaps a test shot. 
CHRIS How long has it been? 
ROSE 10 months, so a year basically; longest I've ever been away. 
Chris takes out another cigarette. Rose promptly grabs it and opens the window. 
CHRIS Whoa... whoa!! Come on! I'm a grown man. If a man says he wants a cigarette, a man should be able TOO- - 
She throws it out the window. 
CHRIS (CONT'D) Okay, so that's like a dollar. You basically just throwin' dollars out the window. 
ROSE You shouldn't have bought them. 
CHRIS I didn't buy them. Rod... Shit. 
ROSE What? 
CHRIS I almost forgot Rod. 
EXT. LAGUARDIA AIRPORT - OUTSIDE THE TERMINAL - DAY 
ROD WILLIAMS, 26, African American, a stocky TSA agent smokes a cigarette. His cell phone rings. 
ROD `Sup? 
INTERCUT WITH: 
INT. ROSE'S CAR - DAY 
Chris sits in the passenger seat and talks on the cell phone. 
CHRIS Hey. You at work? 
ROD Yeah. How I'm gonna get in trouble for following standard procedure? Fuckin' Gary out here thinkin' just because a bitch old, she can't hijack an airplane. 
Chris laughs. 
ROD (CONT'D) Like you can't hide a bomb in a wheelchair? Watch, Chris, the next 9/11 is gonna be on some geriatric shit. 
CHRIS Look, man, real quick. You good to watch Sid this weekend right? 
ROD What? You think I forgot? Damn `C', give your boy a little credit. I don't forget shit; you do. 
CHRIS You're right. My bad. 
ROD Apology accepted. How's `Lil Miss Rosie? 
CHRIS She's good.-- 
Rose takes the phone. 
ROSE Hi, Rod. 
ROD Whattup babygirl? You better bring my boy back in one piece. 
ROSE I don't even know what that means but yes I promise. 
ROD You know you picked the wrong guy though right? 
ROSE It's not too late for us is it? 
Chris takes the phone back. 
CHRIS Okay, get your own girl. 
ROD Damn, I never seen you like this. Meeting the family and everything? What does she do lick your ass? 
CHRIS No! What the fuck is wrong with you? 
Chris snaps to. He nods and takes out his phone. 
EXT. UPSTATE NEW YORK ROAD - DAY 
A cop car is now pulled up to where the deer was hit. OFFICER FROSTIE - Caucasian - 33 stands near the deer. Another officer, OFFICER CROW - 40 - Caucasian with a patronizing smirk, stands by the driver's side window of Rose's car which Rose and Chris are both back in. 
INT. ROSE'S CAR - CONTINUOUS 
OFFICER CROWE So in the future the number to call is Animal Control Services. 
Rose doesn't like the way he's looking at them. 
CHRIS Right. That makes sense. 
OFFICER CROWE You two coming up from the city? 
CHRIS Yeah. 
OFFICER CROWE And what brings you up-- 
ROSE I'm from here. The Lake Pontaco area? We're going home. 
OFFICER CROWE (TO CHRIS) You got a driver's license? 
CHRIS Oh... yeah. 
Chris gives Rose a "see?" Look as he gets his license. 
CHRIS (CONT'D) I mean, I don't have a driver's license, I have a state I.D. 
ROSE I was driving. 
OFFICER CROWE I didn't ask who was driving. I asked him for his I.D. 
ROSE My boyfriend shouldn't have to show you his I.D. because he hasn't done anything wrong. 
OFFICER CROWE Ma'am, any time there is an INCIDENT-- 
ROSE No, fuck that! 
CHRIS Baby. It's okay-- 
ROSE (TO CROWE) It's bullshit, and you know it. 
There is a tense silence. Officer Crowe's walkie chimes in. 
OFFICER FROST (O.C.) Everything alright up there Crowsie? 
Officer Crowe stares Rose down. After a moment he presses his walkie button. 
OFFICER CROWE Yeah, I'm all good. 
He hands Chris his I.D. 
OFFICER CROWE (CONT'D) You guys be careful. 
EXT. RURAL ROAD - DAY 
The car winds through a thickly wooded road. 
INT. ROSE'S CAR - AFTERNOON 
Chris sits in the passenger's seat deep in thought. He watches Rose with a new awe. Rose notices. She shrugs. 
ROSE What? I'm not gonna let anyone fuck with my man. 
CHRIS That was some ride or die shit, baby. I like that. 
Rose smiles at him. 
ROSE We're here. 
EXT. ARMITAGE ESTATE - AFTERNOON 
Above the fireplace is a large hauntingly beautiful portrait an old man and woman. 
CHRIS Wow. 
DEAN "Wow" is good. We'll take wow. 
CHRIS I grew up in a one bedroom, so for me, this is ridiculous. 
DEAN It ought to be. Lord knows we've done enough work on it through the years... 
MISSY (To Rose and Chris) How was the ride in? 
ROSE We hit a deer. 
DEAN MISSY Oh no! Where? 
ROSE (CONT'D) I don't know. Down around Lyons road? 
CHRIS It came out of nowhere. 
MISSY Are you guys okay? 
CHRIS ROSE Yeah. Yeah. It just fruck us out. 
MISSY (CONT'D) I bet. 
DEAN You know what I say. One down... a few hundred thousand to go. 
Dean snickers. 
MISSY ROSE Dean. So awful! Dad. 
DEAN (CONT'D) What?! Those things are everywhere up here, Chris; like rats. The damage they've done to the ecology alone... Anyway, are we ready for the grand tour? 
MISSY Let them unload their bags first. 
DEAN Leave `em. Walter will get `em. 
ROSE I think we'll manage, Dad. 
INT. ARMITAGE UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY 
Rose and Chris take their bags upstairs. 
INT. ARMITAGE HOUSE - ROSE'S BEDROOM - DAY 
Rose's old room is preserved in the state of a young-minded teenage girl. Lots of pink and dated boy band posters, a stuffed lion. A window overlooks the front lawn. 
Rose and Chris place their bags down. 
ROSE (SARCASTIC) You think they wish I was still a kid? 
CHRIS I cannot believe they kept it the same. 
Chris looks at some pictures posted on her dresser. 
ROSE So... 
CHRIS They're great. 
ROSE Yay. 
CHRIS No, they're totally sweet. 
ROSE I told you they'd love you. 
He sees a picture of Rose in high school on stage in a production of `The Crucible.' 
CHRIS What?! Is this you? 
ROSE "The Crucible." I was Abigail. 
CHRIS I didn't know you acted. 
CHRIS Like mother like daughter. 
Dean Cackles. 
INT. ARMITAGE HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY 
CHRIS And you're a surgeon? 
DEAN A neurosurgeon; was. I retired early. Now, I pretty much focus on the house and twiddle my thumbs. 
Dean and Chris pass a closed door. 
DEAN (CONT'D) Oh, downstairs is the wine cellar, the games room, some storage. Apparently a black mold issue down there. Almost everything needs to get thrown out; shame. 
INT. ARMITAGE KITCHEN - DAY 
Dean and Chris continue their walk-through. The kitchen is large, homey and pristine. Large windows overlook the backyard. GEORGINA, African American, 30 stands facing a wall. She is still. 
DEAN My mother loved her kitchen. 
Upon hearing them, Georgina comes alive. She resumes cleaning the kitchen. 
CHRIS That view. 
DEAN Oh, Georgina, this is Chris; Rose's boyfriend. 
Georgina turns to them. She has the same eerie smile as Walter. Like she's masking something. 
CHRIS Hi. 
GEORGINA Hello.- 
DEAN Ah ha! But now for the piece de resistance... 
Dean opens the glass back door. 
EXT. BACKYARD - LATE AFTERNOON 
The yard is huge and the woods beyond it ominous. The wind RUSHES through the trees. Dean leads Chris out through the yard towards a gazebo. 
DEAN Badminton and bocce ball, croquet; we're a family who loves games. Two other families have properties on lake Pontaco, and they're way on the other side. Total privacy. 
Chris is distracted by Walter who prepares the lawn mower in the distance. 
DEAN (CONT'D) I know what you're thinking. 
CHRIS Yeah? 
DEAN Well-to-do white family; black servants... 
CHRIS I wasn't gonna go there. 
DEAN You didn't have to. We hired them a few years ago to help care for my parents; they became part of the family. Couldn't bear to let them go. I hate the way it makes us look though... 
CHRIS Hey. People need work. 
DEAN Yeah. 
They arrive at an outdoor patio. Dean stops Chris from stepping on a dead sparrow. 
DEAN (CONT'D) Well, crap. (CALLING) Walter! 
Walter turns to face them. He has that same eerily mild smile. Vacant in its sincerity. 
DEAN (CONT'D) Another dead bird! (TO CHRIS) Damn things fly into the patio from time to time; break their necks. 
Walter nods slowly. Dean gently kicks the bird's carcass out of their way. 
DEAN (CONT'D) Iced tea? 
EXT. OUTDOOR PATIO - DAY 
Dean, Missy, Chris and Rose sit with iced teas. 
MISSY If you change your mind... We're just glad you could join us for the big get-together. 
Georgina brings the pitcher of iced tea around and refills everyone's glass. Chris tries to thank her with a look. She smiles and avoids eye contact. 
CHRIS The get-together? 
ROSE The party tomorrow? I told you. 
CHRIS I must have forgot. 
MISSY Oh, well we host a shindig once a year for our friends. 
DEAN A tradition. Some of my Dad's old social club. Some old patients. Some just friends... 
MISSY Drinks, good food, good people... 
CHRIS Sounds fun. 
Georgina has been pouring Chris' drink too long and his glass has overflown. 
MISSY Georgina! 
Georgina snaps out of her daze. She realizes what she's done and starts to clean. 
MISSY (CONT'D) It's fine George, I'll get it. Maybe you need a nap. 
Georgina nods, smiles and walks away. Chris and Rose look at Dean. That was odd. Dean shrugs. 
A CAR HORN HONKS in front of the house. 
DEAN Jeremy's home. 
JEREMY, 29, rounds the house with open arms. 
He's "Rich kid intense"; handsome and strong with an unpredictable wildness behind his eyes. 
JEREMY Who answers the door around here?! 
INT. ARMITAGE DINING ROOM - LATER/NIGHT 
Everyone laughs. 
Dean pours the remainder of a bottle of wine into Chris' glass. Their meal is done and they are tipsy. Jeremy pops the cork on a new bottle of wine as he energetically holds court. 
JEREMY One more... So, let me set the scene. I'm a junior; Ro's a freshman and she has a crush on this guy Connor-- 
ROSE --No. Mom. 
MISSY Jeremy... 
CHRIS No, no... These are good. I wanna hear this. 
DEAN Manners, Rose. Give the guest what he wants. 
JEREMY Yeah, Rose. 
ROSE I hate you. 
JEREMY Connor Garfield was on my lacrosse team. Huge guy, like 6'3", and crazy, just like "Looney Tunes," right? We had thrown a party-- 
ROSE You did. 
JEREMY I think my parents were in Greece or something. We had gotten into their liquor cabinet and we're all shit-faced. 
MISSY No you weren't. Were you? 
JEREMY We put water in the bottles so you wouldn't know. Let me finish. Okay, so I'm upstairs in my parents' bathroom hooking up with Jenny Richardson. Hottest girl in our class. 
MISSY Uch. 
ROSE You realize you're coming off like a total douche right now, right? 
JEREMY Thanks. All of a sudden Connor starts banging on the bathroom door, right? I open it, and he's got blood gushing out of his mouth and he's screaming "Your thith-ter bit my fuckin' thongue off!!!!" 
Full moon. CRICKETS. 
INT. ROSE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Rose and Chris make hushed love in her bed. A stuffed lion seems to watch Chris. He turns it away. 
INT. ROSE'S BEDROOM - LATER 
Rose sleeps, but Chris is wide awake. There's a buzz in his ear. He smacks his own head and sits up. A soft HOWL of WIND rushes through the room. The CLOSET DOOR CREEKS open. 
Chris' eyes drift to the pack of cigarettes sticking out of his camera bag pocket draped on the desk chair. 
INT. ARMITAGE HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Chris leaves Rose's room and walks down the dark hallway. A floorboard creaks under his feet. He turns down the stairs. 
INT. ARMITAGE DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 
Chris gets to the bottom of the stairs. He hears the floorboard creek upstairs. He stops and turns, expecting someone to follow him down. Nothing. Chris continues to walk down the hallway past the pictures towards the kitchen. 
The basement door is open a crack. Chris peers into it curiously. A stairwell leads down into pitch darkness. Chris shuts the door. A figure now stands at the end of the hallway behind him. He doesn't notice. He just keeps going into... 
INT. ARMITAGE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 
Chris walks through the kitchen. He bumps into a bar chair moving it slightly. He keeps walking. He continues out the sliding back door of the house. 
EXT. BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS 
Chris steps out the back door and takes a cigarette out. Chris looks into the vast night around him. The CRICKETS are deafening. 
Suddenly, something DARTS FAST across the yard in the distance. Chris peers out into the darkness. The thing RUNS across the lawn again. A moment of terror comes over Chris. He makes out a shape. It's now running towards him. Chris backs up in fear just as the figure emerges from the shadows and into the moonlight. It's Walter, the grounds keeper. He passes Chris without noticing. Chris gathers his breath. 
The kitchen light turns on and floods the backyard. Chris drops the cigarette and stomps it out. He turns back towards the house and finds himself face to face with Georgina, who glares through the window dead in Chris' eyes. He's caught. 
Georgina doesn't react. Chris it still. Georgina suddenly exposes her teeth in a frightening grimace. Chris backs away slowly. 
INT. ARMITAGE KITCHEN - NIGHT 
Georgina sucks her teeth. She doesn't actually see Chris at all. She's looking at her teeth in the reflection in the window which, front lit, reflects her and the room around her. Outside is invisible. 
EXT. BACKYARD - NIGHT 
Chris realizes he's not caught. Close call. Inside Georgina notices the bar chair has been moved. She moves it back into its original position, and begins cleaning the kitchen cabinets. Chris quietly sneaks around the house. 
INT. ARMITAGE DINING ROOM - NIGHT 
Chris sneaks in through the door in the dark dining room. 
INT. ARMITAGE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Chris moves through the living room towards the stairs, the lamp in the middle of the room turns on startling Chris. Missy sits near him; cat in lap; almost seductively. He's caught; for real this time. 
MISSY Quick fix? 
CHRIS Yeah. Nerves got me I guess. 
MISSY Come. Let's nip this in the bud. 
INT. MISSY'S OFFICE - NIGHT 
Missy sits in a chair and directs Chris to sit across from her. She pours them both some tea. Chris sits. 
CHRIS I still don't know if this is right for me. 
MISSY There really is no need to be nervous. 
CHRIS I'm good. The dude was running out there. Scared me. 
MISSY Walter starts early every day. He's borderline obsessive compulsive. Tea? 
CHRIS Nah, I'm good. It'll keep me up. 
Missy puts two sugar cubes in her cup. She begins to stir slowly, CLINKING the SPOON softly and rhythmically against the sides of the cup. 
MISSY You said `you knew something was wrong.' What did you do? 
CHRIS Nothing. 
MISSY Nothing? 
CHRIS I just sat there. Watching TV. 
MISSY You didn't call someone? Your Aunt or the police? 
CHRIS No. 
MISSY Why not? 
CHRIS I don't know. I thought if I did, it would make it real. 
MISSY Next is smell and taste. Breathe in and let the scent fill your nose. Smell that place. Taste it. Find it. 
Chris is getting emotional. He breathes deep through his nose. 
FLASH BACK - INT. SMALL APARTMENT KITCHEN - NIGHT 
Young Chris finishes inhaling. The rain hits the window sill. 
MISSY (V.O.) Tell me. Tell me when you find it. 
Young Chris takes sip of a juice box. 
PRESENT DAY - INT. MISSY'S OFFICE. NIGHT 
26 year old Chris sips from an invisible straw. 
CHRIS I found it. 
TING TING. TING TING. 
MISSY Good. Now lastly, you must see it. Let the light flood into your eyes. Every color, every detail. See it. See it. Find it. 
Chris' eyelids flutter. He continues to scratch the armchair. 
TING TING. TING TING 
FLASHBACK - INT. SMALL APARTMENT - NIGHT 
11-year-old Chris scratches through the wood on his bed, splintering the wood. He watches TV from his bed next to some action figures. 
MISSY (V.O.) Tell me when-- 
11-year-old Chris nods. 
TING TING. TING TING. 
PRESENT DAY - INT. MISSY'S OFFICE. NIGHT 
Chris nods and cries. 
CHRIS --Found it. 
MISSY (REALIZING) You think it was your fault. 
Chris nods. 
TING TING. TING TING. 
MISSY (CONT'D) I want you to feel that fear again, Chris. 
CHRIS I don't want to. 
MISSY It's okay. I'm here. 
Chris trembles anxiously. 
MISSY (CONT'D) Are you afraid now? Paralyzed like that day? 
Its eyes glow and flicker faint blue in its sockets. It MOANS A WRONG SOUNDING MOAN; in hateful anguish. It charges Chris... 
THUNK THUNK. THUNK THUNK. THUNK THUNK. 
The bloody deer impales Chris on its antlers. They both MOAN. 
INT. ROSE'S BEDROOM - DAWN 
Chris wakes up with a start in Rose's bed sweaty and heaving. He's alone and confused. Bad dream? Headache. 
The SHOWER RUNS inside Rose's bathroom. SHE HUMS. 
DING DING 
He's gotten a message. It's a picture of Rod pretending to pour beer in Sid's mouth. Chris smiles. The batteries are low. He plugs his phone in and puts it on the dresser. 
EXT. BACKYARD - DAWN 
It's Golden hour. Beautiful. Chris walks through the yard to the edge of the forest with his camera. 
Chris keeps walking. He looks through a long-zoom lens into the wilderness. He sees a bird and snaps a picture. 
He turns to the house. Georgina can be seen through an upstairs window knitting. He raises his camera. She's beautiful. She stands and begins to remove her wig. Then as if aware she's being watched, she turns towards him. Chris turns away, taking a picture in another direction. He glances back at the window. Georgina is gone. 
BANG. A sparrow slams against the gazebo and falls to the ground. Startling Chris. 
CHRIS Damn. 
He turns away and is startled even more by Walter smiling serenely at him about 50 feet away in the yard. Embarrassed, Chris gathers himself. He walks towards Walter. 
CHRIS (CONT'D) What's up? 
No response. 
CHRIS (CONT'D) They working you good out here, huh? 
Walter's voice is soft and methodical. His eyes remain distant as though he his looking through Chris. Chilling. There is a hidden anger behind his pleasantness. 
WALTER Nothing I don't want to be doing. 
CHRIS Ha! 
Walter isn't joking. 
CHRIS (CONT'D) Yeah... yeah. No, I can tell. I never really got to meet you actually, up close. I'm Chris. 
WALTER I know who you are. You're Rose's friend. 
Chris stops walking about 15 feet from Walter. Something doesn't feel right. 
CHRIS Yeah. That's one way to put it. So, where you from originally? 
WALTER She is lovely isn't she? 
CHRIS Rose? Yeah, she is... 
WALTER One of a kind; a real doggone keeper. 
Chris is weirded out. 
WALTER (CONT'D) Sorry if I scared you last night. 
CHRIS Oh, yeah. Actually, I guess I was pretty drunk. (MORE) 
CHRIS (CONT'D) I don't remember much. 
WALTER And the hypnosis? Did it work? 
CHRIS Hypnosis? No, I didn't... 
Chris remembers. 
WALTER Well, I should get back to work. 
CHRIS I guess people only see what's in front of them. 
Chris notices his faux pas. 
CHRIS (CONT'D) I mean... 
JIM Heh. No, you're right. And usually not even that much. That's people. 
Jim holds a glass up. Chris fist bumps the glass. 
JIM (CONT'D) Jim Hudson. 
CHRIS CHRIS- 
JIM I know who you are. I'm an admirer of your work; you have a great eye... 
CHRIS Wait. Jim Hudson... of Hudson Galleries? 
Jim smiles. 
JIM The irony of being a blind art dealer isn't lost on me. 
CHRIS How do you do it? 
JIM I have an assistant describe work to me. You've got something... The images you capture... so brutally melancholic. Powerful stuff. 
CHRIS Thank you. Yeah, I just like finding the beauty in abandoned things. 
JIM I used to dabble myself. Wilderness mostly. I submitted to Nat Geo 14 times before realizing I didn't have "the eye" for it; Began dealing. And then, of course, my vision went to shit. 
CHRIS Damn. 
JIM I know. Life can be a sick joke. One day you're working in a dark room, and the next day - BAM. You wake up in the dark. Genetic disease. 
CHRIS Shit ain't fair, man. 
JIM Yeah. 
Jeremy comes over with his preppy friend, Derrick, 29. 
JEREMY Chris, we need you... 
CHRIS Yeah, sure. (TO JIM) Nice to meet you. 
JIM Stop by the gallery some time. Bout time you had a solo show. 
CHRIS Really? Wow, okay. Thank you. That would be a game changer. 
JIM I think we could do wonderful things together. 
EXT. BACKYARD - LATER 
Chris and Rose play badminton against Jeremy and Derrick. A gaggle of party guests watch, entertained. Chris is actually having fun. He swings big but misses the shuttlecock. 
JEREMY HA! Come on. You can do better than that! 
CHRIS Not my game, what can I say. 
JEREMY Yeah, I see that. 
ROSE Shut up Jeremy. 
JEREMY I'm just saying, if your boy isn't gonna bring his `A' game, we might as well bring Mom up here. 
CHRIS Whoa, whoa, okay. Now we talkin' smack huh? 
Chris serves the shuttlecock hard. The following rally is long, captivating the crowd. Chris ends it with an impressive diving swat. Derrick misses the return and the crowd goes wild. Chris throws his arms up in celebration. 
CHRIS (CONT'D) Boom! 
ROSE Yay, baby! 
JEREMY See, that's what I'm talking about!!! Okay, again! 
Andre/Logan's voice is higher and scratchy, like it was in the first scene. 
CHRIS Hey, man, I'm sorry, I-- 
Andre/Logan grabs Chris by the shoulders and screams shrilly. Blood trickles out of his nose. 
ANDRE GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!!!! 
Phil and Jeremy grab Andre. They have to pry Andre/Logan's grip off of Chris. When they do Andre/Logan screams bloodcurdlingly. It takes all their strength to bring him into the house. Missy and Dean follow. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON 
Rose sits on the couch. She's been crying. Chris comforts her but is clearly traumatised. A few other concerned guests mill around. Dean enters everyone gives him their attention. 
ROSE What the Hell was that? 
DEAN It was a seizure. 
ROSE A seizure? 
DEAN Yes. Logan's okay. Missy's with him now. Are you okay Chris? 
CHRIS Yeah. Why did he come at me like that? 
ROSE Yeah seizures don't make people attack people, I'm sorry. 
DEAN It was an abnormal manifestation but yes, actually, sometimes they do. The flash on your phone must have triggered it. 
Andre/Logan enters with stands with Missy and Phil to a smattering of concerned applause. 
He addresses a group in his lower pitched "Logan" voice. 
ANDRE/LOGAN Well, I do believe I owe you all an apology. 
The group grumbles. 
MISSY We're just glad you're feeling yourself again. 
ANDRE/LOGAN Well yes I am. It's quite like being trapped in a dark room and watching my experiences through a window. Thank God you and Dean were here to calm me down. 
DEAN It's a simple glitch of the brain. Nothing to be afraid of. 
ANDRE/LOGAN I know I scared you all quite a bit.. especially you Chris. 
CHRIS No, I'm sorry about the flash. I didn't know. 
ANDRE/LOGAN Of course. How could you have? 
PHIL (to Andre/Logan) You shouldn't have been drinking either. 
The group chuckles. 
ANDRE/LOGAN As I said I'm feeling much better now, but you'll all have to proceed without the aid of my marvellous wit; the whole thing has left me a quite a bit exhausted. 
DEAN Of course. 
ANDRE/LOGAN It was nice meeting you. 
CHRIS Yeah, you too. 
Chris is skeptical. Missy shows Phil and Logan out. Andre and Phil leave. 
DEAN Let's do sparklers shall we? Brighten the mood? 
He gives Chris and Rose sparklers and to other people who light them. 
ROSE Let's go. 
Rose takes Chris' hand. 
MISSY Anybody need a drink? 
ROSE We're going on a walk. 
Rose follows Chris down the stairs. 
ROSE Chris... What's wrong? 
CHRIS Nothing. 
Jeremy stands near the front door twirling his lacrosse stick. Dean and Missy sit in the living room. 
JEREMY Where are you going? The party's just getting started. 
CHRIS I'm going to the car; see if we left the keys in there. 
MISSY I just made tea. 
CHRIS I'm good. 
The family is silent. Missy's glare pierces Chris. He avoids eye contact. 
ROSE Oh, I know where they are. In my bag. Duh. 
MISSY You're leaving us. 
CHRIS Yeah. 
MISSY Is something wrong? 
CHRIS No. Well, yeah... Um. 
ROSE (STILL BLANK) His dog is not well. He needs to go to the vet first thing in the MORN-- 
Dean hits play on the sound system. Darkly valiant classical music begins. He standing in front of the fireplace. 
Lost in the fire, Dean begins conducting the music. 
DEAN What is your purpose, Chris? 
CHRIS What? 
DEAN In life? What is your purpose..? 
CHRIS Right now, it's finding the keys. 
DEAN We've been looking for our purpose for such a long time. Fire has mesmerized man since the Stone Age. It is a reflection of our impermanence in the world. Fire is born, it breathes and then it dies. 
CHRIS Rose... 
Rose lamely rummages through her bag. 
ROSE I'm looking. 
CHRIS Rose, what is this shit?! 
DEAN There's a reason we worship the Sun, Chris. He who lights the way through the darkness of life. He in all his glory was around long before us and will be here long after we are gone, but he too will die some day! That's right even the Sun God will die. It is no less mortal than we, but it inspires us to defy it! So what do we do?-- 
CHRIS --Rose.-- 
DEAN (UNHINGED) --What do we do?! We baptize ourselves in the firewater! (MORE) 
DEAN (CONT'D) We bathe in his reflection, for one chance to emerge having defied death! 
DEAN (CONT'D) You'd take that baptism wouldn't you, Chris? The baptism of immortality? 
CHRIS I was raised Episcopalian. 
Chris starts toward the door, but his path is blocked by Jeremy swinging at air. 
JEREMY Whoa! Be careful, bro. 
MISSY Don't hurt him, Jeremy. 
JEREMY What? I'm not doing anything. 
DEAN Listen, Chris-- 
GARY Hey... two strikes. Go take 10; get it together. 
EXT. AIRPORT - DEPARTURES TERMINAL - DAY 
Rod smokes a cigarette and dials Chris. 
CHRIS' VOICEMAIL MESSAGE (V.O.) It's Chris. I'm away from my phone or I just don't want to talk to you. 
ROD Sup? Making sure you good. I thought you were coming back yesterday, so hopefully you home already and just sleeping or some shit. Aiight. Let me know. 
INT. CHRIS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Rod opens the door. Sid wags his tail hungrily. 
INT. CHRIS' KITCHEN - LATER 
Rod opens dog food while he calls Chris. 
CHRIS' VOICEMAIL MESSAGE (V.O.) Hey, it's Chris. I'm away from my phone or I just don't want to talk TO-- 
Rod hangs up. He places Sid's bowl down. Sid doesn't eat. Instead Sid looks back up at Rod and WHINES. 
ROD Yeah... me too. 
INT. CHRIS' LIVING ROOM - LATER 
Rod sits at Chris' desk in front of his laptop. Sid sits on Rod's lap. Rod types "Andre Hayworth" into the search engine. Images of Andre come up. 
Rod finds an article entitled: "What Happened to Andre Hayworth?" under in bold "Brooklyn Native Goes Missing In Evergreen Hallow." 
Rod's eyes go wide. 
ROD Oh shit. 
INT. GAMES ROOM - LATER 
Chris wakes up with a bump on his head. In front of Chris, a deer's head is mounted above an old-school floor-standing television. Behind him, a goat's head is mounted under a taxidermy owl, wings spread. 
His arms and legs fastened to a leather upholstered chair in the middle of a small dark room full of board games. 
Chris pulls at the straps that bind his arms and legs. 
CHRIS Hey. Hey!!!! Rose!!!! 
Chris tries to gnaw at the harnesses, but they are too thick. 
CHRIS (CONT'D) Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh fuck. Oh shit. The fuck?!?!! Y'all are psycho!? Is that it? Let me out of this chair. 
Chris looks around. 
CHRIS (CONT'D) People know I'm here. I told a bunch of people where I was going! You don't know me!!! You don't know me!!!! Hey! Hey!! Hey!!!!! 
The television screen turns on. Chris watches intently. The image of deer walking through woods comes on. The words 
"YOU'VE GOT A FRIEND by James Taylor" comes up as the song starts to PLAY. It's a forest-themed karaoke video. 
Chris is confused. He tries to slip out of the binds again drawing blood on his wrists. 
INT. CHRIS' LIVING ROOM - DAWN 
Sid wakes Rod up with a lick to the face. He's on the sofa. 
INT. POLICE STATION - DAY 
Rod sits at a desk with Sid on his lap.. DETECTIVE LATOYA 50, African American enters. She looks like she's been doing this way too long. She speaks to someone outside her office. 
DETECTIVE LATOYA ...Then he should've gone back up there and made sure everything was accounted for. (MORE) 
DETECTIVE LATOYA (CONT'D) `Cause hey, look; how about this? If you record the evidence, you're responsible for it. 
Latoya shuts the door and sits at her desk. She begins opening and eating a bag of cashews. 
DETECTIVE LATOYA (CONT'D) Hello Mr... 
LATOYA (to her colleagues) So, I don't want none of you sayin' I don't do nothin' for you... White girls'll get ya every time! 
They laugh even harder. 
INT. GAMES ROOM - LATER 
The SONG PLAYS Over and over. Chris is too weak to struggle. 
CHRIS Is this the only song you got? 
INT. GAMES ROOM - LATER 
The SONG ends. It BEGINS again. 
CHRIS Okay. Okay! What do you want? You tryin' to break me? I won't say shit!! I'll just... I'll do what you say, just answer me! 
INT. CHRIS' LOFT - DUSK 
Rod sits by the window with Sid. He looks out over rooftops and thinks. He picks up his phone and calls Chris again. He knows Chris won't answer. Then-- 
ROSE Hello? 
Rod is taken off guard. He almost drops his phone. 
ROSE (CONT'D) Chris? 
ROD Yo. Um, Rose? It's Rod. 
ROSE Hi. 
ROD Where's Chris? 
INTERCUT WITH: 
INT. ARMITAGE HOUSE. DINING ROOM - DUSK 
Rose stands by the dining table on Chris' phone. Rose starts to cry. 
ROSE He left like two days ago. 
ROD He left? 
ROSE We got in a fight. He got all paranoid and flipped out; He took a cab home. He forgot his phone. Wait... You haven't seen him? 
ROD No. He never made it back here. 
ROSE Oh my God. 
ROD I've been calling. I went to the police and everything. 
Rose is silent. 
ROD (CONT'D) Hello? 
ROSE What did you say? 
ROD I told them he was missing. 
ROSE Uh huh... 
ROD So... What cab company did he use? 
ROSE I don't know. A local one I'm guessing. Maybe uber? Wait, I'm so confused... 
ROD Hold on a second. 
Rod knows she had something to do with it. 
He opens up `Garage Band' on Chris' computer and puts the phone on speaker, recording her. 
ROD (CONT'D) So, last time Chris and I talked, he told me your mom hypnotized him? 
Rose is silent. Then... 
JIM They asked me for my favorite song, which was hard; I like all types of music. Turns out they really just needed one I knew all the words to: I went with James Taylor's "You Got a Friend." I hope it hasn't been too torturous; that wasn't the point. The point is that you learn it, and for us to have that knowledge in common. 
CHRIS Who the fuck are you people? 
JIM Oh right. Okay, let me back up and give you the cliff notes. The Armitages and I are a part of a society. A pretty extraordinary society actually. (MORE) 
JIM (CONT'D) One whose sole purpose for many many years has been a search for a very powerful object. Armitage lineage redefined the nature of that search. They proved that the power didn't just exist in that object; You see, with science the Armitage's created a miracle. 
CHRIS You hypnotize me? Break my will..? Make me a slave like the others? This is some crazy racist shit. 
JIM No. Not racist, Chris. We don't hate you. We want to be you... You are not going to be a slave. You're going to be a vessel. 
CHRIS Wait, what? 
JIM Missy's hypnosis was merely to sedate you. Oh, that and to prepare you psychologically... 
CHRIS For what? 
Jim smiles. 
JIM For the procedure. 
CHRIS What's the procedure? 
JIM Are you ready...? Drum roll please. Brain transplantation. Some say it could never be done; 
JIM (CONT'D) They experimented for centuries, but it turned out re-linking the brain to a foreign central nervous system was impossible. The nerve connections are far too intricate and delicate. 
CHRIS What the fuck? 
JIM Dean's the only guy who really gets the science. He's the one who discovered that full brain transplantation isn't actually necessary to transfer the soul, and that partial brain transplantation solves the little nerve ending problem. 
CHRIS No. 
Jim holds up a Color coded diagram of the human Brain. There is a big red part that takes up 80% of the image. The other 20% is blue and located near the lower back of his skull. 
JIM Okay so... You see the blue part? That's the piece of your brain that's all rooted in the nervous system. So that stays; keeping those tricky little connections intact. The rest is discarded. Then they'll remove the red part of my brain from my skull and put in yours. Your "blue" and my "red" basically absorb each other. And apparently the brain heals surprisingly fast, so assuming everything goes as planned, we should be up and functioning in a couple weeks. 
CHRIS And my brain? 
JIM Your red part? It'll be discarded, but don't worry. You wont be gone. Well not completely. You'll still be in there somewhere; limited consciousness of course; 
JIM (CONT'D) you'll still be able to see and hear but your existence will be as a passenger... an audience. You will live in... 
CHRIS (DEFEATED) ...The Sunken Place. 
JIM Yes. That's what she calls it. Good! So you understand, I'll control the motor functions, the will of our body, effectively MAKING ME-- 
CHRIS Me... You will be me. 
JIM As far as the world is concerned. It's still a pretty new operation. Some kinks. We're supposed to stay away from flashes of light for example. They can trigger a "momentary lapse in control of motor functions..." 
CHRIS Why black people? 
Jim is disappointed in the question. 
JIM Well, because you get the highest bids. For the last decade or so anyway. I wish it was less simple than that, but it's not. You're in fashion, baby! 
Final hope sinks from. Chris shoulders. 
JIM (CONT'D) Honestly though, personally..? I couldn't give two shits about race. I don't care if you're black, brown, green, purple... whatever. What I want is so much deeper: Your eye, man. I want those things you see through. 
CHRIS That's crazy. 
JIM Take it as a compliment. 
CHRIS You're not going to get away with this. 
JIM We have and we will. We'll be together soon, brother. 
The television turns off. Chris clenches his body trying to pry free from his restraints, before his shoulders collapse with exhaustion. He lifts his head to a rip in the leather arm of the chair revealing its cotton stuffing. He looks at the cotton. We see Chris make a difficult decision. 
LATER... 
She sniffs the air. She is suddenly afraid. She turns off the light illuminating the back yard. Walter runs back and forth in the distance. She turns the light back on again. Chris' reflection is now behind hers. He looks savage; covered in blood. Georgina screams and runs out the back door. 
Chris heads to the door, but sees his phone on the dining room table. He goes for it. 
INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Chris runs through the dining room and finds his cell phone on the dining room table. 
Chris picks up his phone and presses the power button. The loading screen comes up. 
Chris grunts with frustration as he hears a creak behind him. It's Missy, now in the kitchen doorway behind him holding her teacup and spoon. She begins clinking her tea cup... 
TING... 
Chris knocks the cup out of her hand spraying hot water on her chest and face. She screams. 
The cat bounds off the dining room table at Chris' face. Chris punches it out of the air. This has given Missy enough time to grab a knife. She lunges at Chris screaming psychotically. Chris can't pin her down. She slices his hands. Chris grabs the tea pot and cracks her in the head with it. She falls. He hits her one more time. Done. 
The cat slinks out an open window. 
INT. FOYER - CONTINUOUS 
Chris runs towards the front door. Before he can open it, he hears a footsteps running upstairs from the basement followed bloodcurdling scream from back in the kitchen: 
JEREMY (O.C.) Ahhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!! 
Jeremy bursts though the dining room and pounces on Chris' back. The two roll around. 
Chris throws his elbow back at Jeremy who blocks it and uses it to put Chris in a choke hold from behind. Chris slams the back of his head into Jeremy's face. He does it again, and again, and again. Jeremy squeezes tighter. 
Chris, about to pass out, reaches into Jeremy's pocket and pulls out his keys. He scrapes them deep into Jeremy's eye. Jeremy screams in pain and Chris wriggles out of his grasp tripping him with an improvised Judo throw. Jeremy lunges at Chris again but slips on his own blood banging the back of his head on the coffee table. He's out. 
EXT. FRONT YARD - NIGHT 
Chris begins to run but then sees the beige sports car we recognize from the opening scene. He looks at Jeremy downed in the doorway and then at the keys in his hand. 
Moments later... 
INT. SPORTS CAR - NIGHT 
Chris is in the driver's seat. The tubular metal helmet sits next to him in the passengers seat. His phone finally turns on. There is a very small amount of batteries. He turns the ignition. The English to French tutorial comes on. 
TUTORIAL I seem to have misplaced my passport. Je crois avoi egare mon passeport. 
Chris peels off, driving fast through the field into the night. He dials 911. 
911 OPERATOR 911 emergency, I'm at the home of Dean and Missy Armitage-- 
Chris looks in the rearview mirror as the house gets smaller behind him. All of a sudden, BAM! The car slams into and over Georgina, who, in the night, seems to come out of nowhere. The phone falls. 
CHRIS Ahhhh! 
TUTORIAL Can you direct me to the nearest hospital? Pouvez-vous me diriger vers I'hopital le plus proche? 
He drives on a few more seconds on a flat tire but then stops the car. Chris breathes heavy. 
CHRIS (TO HIMSELF) No... no... Don't do it... Just get the fuck gotta here... Just go! Just... Fuck! 
Chris puts the car in reverse and drives backwards beside the motionless bloody heap that is Georgina. 
TUTORIAL Where is the nearest train station? Ou est la gare la plus proche? 
He looks back at the house which is now filling with smoke. 
Chris quickly gets out of the car and lifts what's left of Georgina's mangled unconscious body into the passenger's seat of the car. He shuts the door and gets in the driver's seat. He floors it. 
After a moment of driving, Georgina's eyes open and she rises. The wig slides off her head revealing an old surgical scar around the top of her head. Chris hasn't noticed her yet. He reaches for his phone. 
TUTORIAL (CONT'D) Can you please call the police? Pouvez-vous s'il vous plait appelez la police? 
Annoyed, Chris turns off the sound system just before Georgina grabs his face and scratches it. 
GEORGINA Ahhhhh!!

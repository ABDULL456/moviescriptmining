An intricate piano piece - GEORGE FREDERICK HANDEL... 
INTERCUT WHITE ON BLACK CREDITS WITH BELOW... 
1   INT. RUSTIC STUDIO OF AN ARTISAN. DAY 1                         1   * 
A series of shots. 
Blue sky through shabby windows. Run down walls. A paint splashed pine floor.    Tens of paint brushes soaking in stained jars. An artisan's hands - weather-worn, swirling a paint brush in dirty water that sways at the bottom of one of the jars. 
A canvas - the sketched face of a woman - blonde, blue eyed as the artisan strokes paint into her features - a poster girl for 18th century portraiture. (We will later recognise her as ELIZABETH MURRAY) CAPTION: ENGLAND 1766 
2   EXT/INT. DOCKS/SLUM ROOM. ENGLAND - DAY. 2                      2   * 
A swallow cuts across a red tinged sky.   SOUND of footsteps trudging through mud. EXTREME CLOSE UP: a small figure being dressed by someone - a shoulder, an arm, little hands. We do not see a face. CLOSE: heavy naval boots move at sombre pace through slums. 
Against a stone floor, a child's feet are laced into boots. 
A starving dog barks , darts between tradesmen, sailors. Hold this image as Handel comes to an END. 
3   INT. SLUM ROOM - DAY. 2                                         3   * 
A CHILD'S POV as the door opens. We see a gentleman in ceremonial naval dress - CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAY, aristocratic, handsome...alarmed at the sight before him. 
His eyes close with some sad, internal pain and as they re- open...We see what he sees... A fragile girl...around six years old stands in shabby surroundings. Her terrified eyes stare back, leaving LINDSAY at a loss. He takes in her features - delicate with a full mouth that underlines her ethnicity. 
She is DIDO ELIZABETH BELLE...part black, part white. 
He speaks quietly- words almost as fragile as she is. 
CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAY Hello little girl...Little Dido. (pause) I am your father. Silence. Then a tear rises to the surface and as her confused tears spill, so too do LINDSAY'S. 
His POV: a POOR BLACK WOMAN oversees DIDO from afar. CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAY (CONT'D) (re. Dido) How lovely she is. So much of her mother. (his eyes sting) I tried...but how...how could I separate a mother from her child? (he restrains tears) And now nature has deprived me of such a dilemma. He composes himself - feeling futile... 
CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAY (CONT'D) Thank you..for taking her. He reaches into his pocket, holds out money to the woman. CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAY (CONT'D) You may leave us. 
The WOMAN hesitates, scurries to DIDO, placing her lips to the child's head in a prolonged kiss. Then she is gone. DIDO is left frightened and stunned! 
SIR JOHN LINDSAY I beg you, uncle...love her - as I would, were I here. (sadly) And ensure that she is in receipt of all that is due to her as a child of mine. 
LADY MARY gasps, under... LADY MANSFIELD That is simply impossible. 
SIR JOHN LINDSAY What is right can never be impossible. 
His firm gaze holds his aunt and uncle to account. A long beat. LADY MANSFIELD stands conflicted. LADY MANSFIELD What has she been named? SIR JOHN LINDSAY She is Belle...after her mother. Dido Elizabeth Belle...Lindsay. 
LORD MANSFIELD She takes your name? 
SIR JOHN LINDSAY I am not ashamed. 
LINDSAY stands his ground. 
LADY MARY We cannot have another Elizabeth in the household. LADY MANSFIELD regards the child, then looks to her husband, gravely. He turns his back - aggrieved. 
LADY MANSFIELD We...we will call her Dido. (off Lindsay's nod) Good Lord, she is thin. Mary, find her something to eat. LORD MANSFIELD storms from the room. LADY MANSFIELD follows. LINDSAY kneels, choked with emotion. 
SIR JOHN LINDSAY Little Belle - sweet child... (weak smile) My wish is to keep you...keep you with me...but a ship...it is no place for one so precious as you. (pause) In these walls, yours will be a life equal to my blood. A beat. Through eyes that brim...he catches his breath. LADY MARY is both stunned and moved - she has to turn away. SIR JOHN LINDSAY (CONT'D) You will not understand in this moment, but hold this in your heart...you are loved...Just as I loved your mother. A tear spills and DIDO's little fingers come up to wipe it from his cheek. He presses his lips to her hand, sobbing a moment, and then he is gone - to stay any longer would be too much to bare. 
7   INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. STAIRS/ENTRANCE HALL/GALLERY - DAY. 2    7    * 
ON ELIZABETH seated at the grand staircase as LADY MARY and DIDO emerge. Like ELIZABETH, DIDO is now freshly dressed in rich silks, an adorable sight as they move through corridors ELIZABETH Are you...a nee-gro? ELIZABETH makes her way across...taking her aunt's hand as all three walk. DIDO is silent. 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) Are you what they call `a negro?' I heard them talking. LADY MARY Questions, questions, Elizabeth! Tis a most irritating trait you and your father share. ELIZABETH Papaa M? LADY MARY No your blood papaa. Sir David Murray. You should not insist on always speaking your mind, you know. You will end up an old maid with only your own company for entertainment! ELIZABETH Like you, Aunt Mary? That is what the maids say? 
LADY MARY You little.... 
ELIZABETH takes off. LADY MARY rushes after her. DIDO is left alone - through the doorway of the gallery, a portrait of LINDSAY stares at her. She gazes at it. 
LORD MANSFIELD approaches, arrested at the sight of DIDO, newly tidied. He follows her gaze to LINDSAY'S image. The sight affects him, unexpectedly. LORD MANSFIELD Captain Sir John Lindsay. (off her reaction) Do you recognise him? She nods. A beat as conflict fills him. 
8   INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. GALLERY. CONTINUOUS. DAY 2                8    * 
LORD MANSFIELD D'you see here...? This..this is your grandfather, Sir Alexander Lindsay of Evelick. 
DIDO examines the painting. LORD MANSFIELD watches her. LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D) I am here too....do you see? 
Her eyes search the long line of her aristocratic heritage, until her gaze settles. He chuckles, reluctantly charmed as she points to his likeness. LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D) Yes...I am William Murray, First Earl of Mansfield. A beat as he looks to her, affected by this little person. Gently, he leads her to a final portrait. 
LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D) (carefully) Now...do you see this man? He is my nephew...do you understand...? (off Dido's nod) ...your uncle - Sir David Murray. 
DIDO Elizabeth's papa. 
ELIZABETH I said...`Your hands have the suggestion of a sensitive man'. She wrinkles her nose, minxish. Across the table... LADY ASHFORD I must say, the entire country barely breathes awaiting your judgement on this appeal. Terrified you shall destroy England, no doubt. I know Lord A is. He does wonder though, what can be taking you...so long? LORD MANSFIELD (mild condescension) The law, Lady Ashford. It is to be interpreted - not merely administered. LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D) Your husband of all people knows this. LADY MARY My brother is not a man of rash instinct. LADY MANSFIELD For that we are all grateful. 
LADY ASHFORD What a lot of fuss over dead cargo. LORD MANSFIELD It is a fuss over the bread and butter of a great many in these isles. A great many, Lady Ashford. 
OFF LORD MANSFIELD'S distaste.... 
23   EXT. KENWOOD HOUSE. LAWNS - NIGHT. 4                        23    * The windows glint with candlelight, DIDO sits at a bench alone. Laughter from the house carries in the breeze. A rustle in the branches behind her. She stands, startled. A beat, then she turns on her heels and sprints - fast. 
24   INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. ENTRANCE HALL. NIGHT. 4                 24    * 
Breathless, DIDO races inside as WIMBRIDGE appears. DIDO Wimbridge! 
WIMBRIDGE Miss Lindsay? DIDO There are poachers wandering...! The sound of the echoing doorbell, jolting DIDO. Her eyes dart to the door. WIMBRIDGE hesitates, then answers. 
A YOUNG MAN stands, damp brow, and as breathless as DIDO. We recognise him as the YOUNG MAN seen earlier in the church. He is JOHN DAVINIER, son of REVEREND DAVINIER. JOHN Good evening to you. I am John Davinier, I..I believe I may have disturbed a lady of this house... He sets eyes on DIDO, peering from the great staircase. 
JOHN (CONT'D) Ah...she is there. (calling out to her) Please forgive me...though you barely gave me a chance... DIDO turns her back, horrified. How dare he address her without formal introduction?! 
DIDO Sir, I do not believe we have been introduced! JOHN takes hold of himself, half mortified, half irritated. JOHN Indeed. I...I... (to Wimbridge, feeling foolish) Please inform the lady of my apologies for startling her. I took advantage of the back fields, by way of a short-cut to deliver this to Lord Mansfield... from my father. 
WIMBRIDGE Sir? He hands WIMBRIDGE an envelope. JOHN Reverend Davinier. 
WIMBRIDGE Of course, sir. I will see that he gets it immediately... 
DIDO can't help but interfere. She calls over her shoulder. DIDO You shall not interrupt him at dinner, Wimbridge! WIMBRIDGE Immediately - after dinner, sir. JOHN resists rolling his eyes - ghastly female! 
JOHN Yes, of course...thank you. He backs away. DIDO still shows him nothing but her back. 
JOHN (CONT'D) (to Wimbridge, awkward) Good night. 
WIMBRIDGE Good night, sir. He moves off, and is gone as DIDO finally turns, stares at the closed door, flushed. 
25   INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. DRAWING ROOM. CONTINUOUS - NIGHT. 4.     25    * 
A single figure - at the farthest end of the crimson drawing room...DIDO'S heart skips a beat at the SOUND of the approaching dinner party...Suddenly the doors open ...DIDO stands quickly - nervous. 
LORD MANSFIELD Dido...my dear. 
LADY ASHFORD (whispers to her sons) Good Lord - the negro! She really is... JAMES ASHFORD (quietly disturbed) ...a lady. 
OLIVER Capital! LADY ASHFORD I hadn't expected her to look so...black. OLIVER Mamaa, did you not listen to the rumours when you were spreading them? DIDO curtseys respectfully to LORD MANSFIELD. LORD MANSFIELD May I present to you the second of my nieces - Miss Dido Lindsay. 
DIDO curtseys. LADY ASHFORD nods graciously. OLIVER bows - has to nudge his troubled brother do the same. 
DIDO looks up to find OLIVER smiling across at her. DIDO Well... (deferring to her father) Papaa...? 
LORD MANSFIELD hesitates. DIDO is embarrassed. 
OLIVER Oh do not be selfish with your good fortune, m'lord! A beat...then put on the spot, LORD MANSFIELD caves, throwing up his hands, helplessly. 
DIDO is tentative, ELIZABETH less pleased. LADY ASHFORD This will be most interesting! DIDO moves to the pianoforte settles her fingers on the keys. A beat, then Handel's Suite No.9 fills the room. 
LORD MANSFIELD closes his eyes, irritated with himself. LADY MARY whispers to LADY MANSFIELD. LADY MARY She has never played in company! LADY MANSFIELD is silent - stiff with anxiety. 
DIDO is raising a beautiful and fluent sound - as skillful as the most gifted of Georgian young ladies. LORD MANSFIELD'S eyes spring open - sees all held hostage. OLIVER moves forward, utterly fascinated. Relief floods LADY MANSFIELD - she sighs with pride as LADY MARY lends LADY ASHFORD a smug look. 
LADY ASHFORD (conceding) She is...most accomplished. LADY MANSFIELD (with deep satisfaction) Hers was a most diligent governess. 
27   INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. UPSTAIRS CORRIDORS - NIGHT. 4             27    * 
Echoing footsteps. LORD and LADY MANSFIELD move toward their rooms, each with a lamp to light their way. LADY MANSFIELD The liberty of asking her to play! And when he can have no better intentions towards her. She stops in her tracks briefly, suddenly unsure... LADY MANSFIELD (CONT'D) Can he?? 
They round a corner. LADY MANSFIELD (CONT'D) ...His family name will, no doubt, entice her to take him seriously. LORD MANSFIELD She must not delude herself. Such decisions are not hers to make. LADY MANSFIELD Then spell it out to her! Before she renders herself...sport to some `gent' of cruel promises!!! LORD MANSFIELD She has no reason. Hers is an inheritance that renders her free of the usual inducements to marry. 
LADY MANSFIELD Well, that, at least, is true, (burdened, grave) Indeed, it is Elizabeth who needs to secure her bread and butter. 
28   INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. GROUND FLOOR CORRIDORS/STUDIO. DAY. 5 28        * Feminine feet move along the corridor.   REVEAL DIDO making her way to LORD MANSFIELD'S study. 
Her POV: through the doorway to the studio. 
An UNFAMILIAR FACE mixing paints, engrossed. His weather- worn hands are recognisable from the opening credits. His stare meets DIDO's, calmly moved by her beauty as she stands, frozen - her full lips parted in astonishment. 
29   INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. DIDO AND ELIZABETH'S BEDROOM - DAY. 5 29      * ELIZABETH stands at the mirror - a maid dressing her. 
ELIZABETH A portrait? Are you sure? 
DIDO Yes...Aunt Mary has confirmed it. 
DIDO sits, light headed, anxiety running through her. 
ELIZABETH Good Lord. How...truly wonderful. 
DIDO But...but... ELIZABETH (becoming exasperated) But what, Dido? 
30   INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. LORD MANSFIELD'S STUDY. DAY. 5          30    * DIDO hurls herself into the room, utterly panicked. DIDO Papaa...should he not have wished to SEE me before deciding? 
She throws her hands up woefully, and finds another face staring back at her - It is JOHN DAVINIER. He regards her from a huge law book. She stands mortified. DIDO (CONT'D) (to Lord M) I am sorry...I did not know you... 
JOHN That I do not know, M'lord. I have not yet been afforded those considerations...but I know a country life does not suit me. 
LORD MANSFIELD's gaze is trained on JOHN. DIDO has finished gathering the books and is quietly slipping from the room. LORD MANSFIELD The Reverend has requested I take his son into my tutorage, Dido. (Beat) What do you think? 
DIDO freezes, in the doorway - all eyes locked on her. 
31   INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. GALLERY - NIGHT. 5                       31    * DIDO moves along the hallway, lined with enormous artists'         * interpretations, communicating a certain lifestyle. 
She slows, caught by one of the paintings - an English rose stares out, as a black domestic submissively fastens a priceless bracelet around her lady-master's wrist. DIDO's POV: CLOSE on the domestic. Suddenly... JOHN Thank you for your gracious support. 
DIDO jumps - finds JOHN standing beside her. DIDO I neither spoke for or against you - since neither is my place. 
JOHN Silence speaks volumes. Elizabeth approaches, calls out, as she curtseys. 
ELIZABETH Papaa's new student. 
JOHN Indeed! DIDO Mr Davinier, my cousin, Elizabeth. JOHN A pleasure. 
DIDO (to John) Papaa has never taken a pupil, you realise? ELIZABETH Someone to keep you company while you take Papaa's dictation, Dido. (to John) Truth is, there have been more of your sex at Kenwood this week, than I've previously seen in all my entire life! DIDO flushes. 
JOHN Hopefully we have not disappointed! ELIZABETH On the contrary! She raises a minxish eyebrow and moves off. Awkward silence. 
DIDO Mr Davinier, what...what is the importance of the Zong... why is the case before Papaa's court, the supreme court...? He searches her, taken aback.   Why is she asking him? 
JOHN Well... (he struggles, tentative) It is a cargo ship. 
DIDO I...I am aware of that. 
JOHN A human-cargo ship. DIDO hesitates, tentative. 
DIDO Oh. You said those who were drowned. 
JOHN It lost most of its slaves before arriving at its destination. (hesitant) Drowned - by the crew on the captain's order. 
JOHN watches as DIDO falters. 
DIDO But...why? 
The SOUND of the MANSFIELDS gathering with the ASHFORDS. A maid approaches hurrying about her duties. 
MAID Miss, your supper is served now in the ladies' parlour. 
DIDO Thank you. JOHN hesitates, struck with confusion at the maid's words. DIDO becomes awkward. LADY MANSFIELD emerges, disappearing into the dining room. LADY MANSFIELD Mr Davinier, will you be joining us for dinner? JOHN's eyes dart to DIDO - sees her unease. It pierces him. 
LADY MARY Do not look at me like that! It was my Mamaa who intervened. I thought he had a very great sense of duty. Overly kind at times but... LADY MANSFIELD watches as though she knows the rest. 
DIDO (gently) But...what, Aunt Mary? 
LADY MARY hesitates and LADY MANSFIELD cuts in, saving her. LADY MANSFIELD HE is engaged, you know? DIDO follows her gaze to JOHN, as he climbs from the horse, hands it to a STABLEMAN. 
LADY MARY Engaged! ELIZABETH Is he? LADY MANSFIELD Mr Beresford's daughter. 
ELIZABETH The carriage-maker! He might have set his sights a little higher! AS JOHN marches toward the back entrance of the house. He nods to the ladies. A self-conscious beat between he and DIDO, her back to him - as he disappears inside. 
OFF her reaction. 
35   INT. KENWOOD STUDIO. DAY. 7                                 35    * 
CLOSE ON: the soft curls around DIDO'S hairline, a single eye, her nose, cheek. HOLD on her lips. 
ON the painter's canvas...a sketch emerging - he brings DIDO'S mouth to life. We see an outline of ELIZABETH with some detail, already been created. REVEAL ELIZABETH beside DIDO. As her hand slides over to DIDO'S and she squeezes it tight. ON their clasped hands. 
ZOFFANY To the window, Miss Lindsay DIDO favours the window a little more...Soft sunlight pours onto her skin. 
36   INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. CORRIDORS/STUDIO. DAY. 7                36    * 
JOHN moves through corridors - hat under his arm. ELIZABETH emerges from the studio, drawing his attention to... Through a half open doorway, his POV: DIDO sits on stool before ZOFFANY. The sight draws JOHN to a halt. He attempts to move off - but cant! He observes DIDO quietly. She is somehow tranquil under Zoffany's gaze. 
A beat before her eyes fall on JOHN'S outline in the doorway - his stare, penetrating and compelling. ON ZOFFANY - he follows DIDO'S gaze to JOHN. Then he sketches madly, filling in DIDO'S eyes in great detail. ON JOHN, embarrassed - he moves away quickly.   DIDO is affected. She jumps up! Goes after him! 
As ELIZABETH'S eyes follow, uncertain. DIDO Wait... She is upon him in the CORRIDOR! They stand silent, awkward. 
JOHN I...I was curious... DIDO Quite a task - to sit for so many                       * hours...(beat)... Congratulations! I learned of your..your match..yesterday.                            * JOHN Thank you. He falters slightly, swallows hard - not all is well. 
Her eyes hone in on a pamphlet under his arm. JOHN shifts uneasy at what it shows - the last few letters of THE ZONG can be seen, and LORD MANSFIELD depicted with large butt. DIDO I appear the only one to have just learned of this affair? 
JOHN Perhaps yours is a life less concerned with such matters. DIDO Why do you judge me so? He studies her. She is tentative. 
DIDO (CONT'D) It is a fact that I have contemplated on the matter for many hours, and I...I do not think the slaves could have been drowned in the way you say. 
ON his disbelief - irritation slowly turns to dawning. 
JOHN Are you at utter disconnect from everything?! He searches her, making her feel very small and ashamed. As he moves off, she stares after him, distressed. 
DIDO Mr Davinier...please. Tell me. Tell me what you know! 
He stops, stares back at her.   What to do? DIDO (CONT'D) (earnest) Do not render me your amusement. He traces her vulnerability. It roots him. 
LORD MANSFIELD stares back at her. LORD MANSFIELD (clarifying) Elizabeth is to come out. 
40   INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. LADIES' PARLOUR - DAY. 7                40    * LADY MANSFIELD Dido is not. 
ELIZABETH'S face falls. 
41   INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. DRAWING ROOM - CONTINUOUS. DAY. 7       41    * 
LORD MANSFIELD stares solemnly at DIDO. 
DIDO But why? LORD MANSFIELD You understand the ways of this world for a female, Dido. Elizabeth has no income. When all this is gone to her father, I have nothing to leave her. 
42   INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. LADIES PARLOUR - DAY. 7      42    * LADY MANSFIELD You are to meet as many gentlemen as possible, before we make the match. ELIZABETH Oh! 
43   INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. DRAWING ROOM. DAY. 7         43    * 
DIDO is speechless. 
DIDO And me? 
LORD MANSFIELD Dido, you are well taken care of - Of this, you are well aware. 
44   INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. LADIES' PARLOUR - DAY.7      44    * LADY MANSFIELD A gentleman of good breeding is unlikely to form any serious attachment to Dido, and a man without, will lower her position in society. ELIZABETH But she is not merely my cousin, Mamaa, she is my sister. I cannot attend London without her! 
45   INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. DRAWING ROOM - DAY.7         45    * 
DIDO'S gaze is pained. LORD MANSFIELD You may attend London together to keep Elizabeth company and save the pain of a few weeks separation. 
46   INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. LADIES' PARLOUR. DAY.7                46    * 
LADY MANSFIELD shakes her head. 
LADY MANSFIELD Lord knows I will need you both to keep each other out of trouble. 
47   INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. DRAWING ROOM - DAY.7                  47    * 
DIDO Papaa... LORD MANSFIELD You are not to be denied, Dido. 
He looks down. DIDO'S eyes follow to a large bunch of keys. DIDO Papaa, please! LORD MANSFIELD These are the keys to the house. They have hung at the waist of your aunt for the last thirty years. DIDO (horrified) No! I am not Lady Mary. I am not an unwanted maid! 
LORD MANSFIELD feels no choice but to go on. LORD MANSFIELD Lady Mary is too old to continue in charge of the house. He places the keys in her hand and closes her fingers. 
LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D) You may assume her duties on your return. A most respectable position for an unmarried Mansfield Lady. She stares at him, disbelieving, bereft... 
ELIZABETH catches sight of JOHN riding across the heath. 
ELIZABETH John Davinier is leaving very early today! DIDO moves to the window. Her POV: JOHN on horseback as he disappears over the brow. ELIZABETH, LADIES MANSFIELD and MARY watch as LORD MANSFIELD storms past the doorway.- all is not well, they can tell. LORD MANSFIELD's gaze locks with DIDO through the doorway - he falters, moves on. OFF DIDO's realisation - JOHN is not coming back . 
52   EXT. HAMPSTEAD - DAY 9                                       52    * 
CLOSE ON hooves - the Mansfield carriage is on the move to London. The familiar lush horizon provides the backdrop. ON the luggage-laden carriage - the girls whisper. 
ELIZABETH (OOV) Do you think I may see Mr James in town? 
DIDO (O.C.) Perhaps. 
53   INT. MANSFIELD CARRIAGE. CONTINUOUS DAY. 9                   53    * 
ELIZABETH whispers to DIDO, completely matter of fact. 
ELIZABETH I could fall in love with such a man, Dido. LADY MARY Love? 
The two girls are startled. LADY MARY smiles to herself. DIDO (whispers) Bette, you could feel no such sentiment for you should either end poor or... broken hearted. 
54   EXT. LONDON STREETS. DAY. 9                                  54    * 
The carriage rounds a corner, weaves through the bustle of markets, peasants, guided by HARRY, the MANSFIELD driver. 
ON DIDO's face, staring from the moving carriage. 
55   EXT. LONDON STREETS. DAY. 9                                55    * 
Bloomsbury Square opens before us. As the carriage halts... 
ELIZABETH (O.C) Aren't you quietly relieved? 
DIDO Relieved? 
ELIZABETH That you shan't be at the caprice of some silly Sir and his fortune! (off Dido's silence) The rest of us haven't the choice! Not a chance of inheritance if we have brothers and forbidden from any activity that allows us to support ourselves. 
ELIZABETH sighs. ELIZABETH (CONT'D) (c'est la vie) We are but their property. 
OFF DIDO, affected. 
56   INT./EXT. BLOOMSBURY SQUARE ENTRANCE HALL - DAY. 9         56    * LIBBY, the housekeeper and THOMAS, the butler stand on ceremony. Maids help the Mansfield ladies as they disrobe. ON DIDO as her gaze falls on MABEL (20), a black maid helping ELIZABETH with her hat. A beat as DIDO stiffens. 
LADY MANSFIELD Light the fires for dinner, will you, Thomas. ON MABEL as she catches DIDO'S stare, forcing DIDO to avert her gaze quickly, turning her back to distance herself. 
He moves to OLIVER, observing DIDO, under a nearby tree. LORD ASHFORD Lord Mansfield's infamous Mulatto. No wonder our `Lord Chief Justice knows not whether he is coming or going! Not your usual game, Oliver. 
OLIVER examines his father. LORD ASHFORD (CONT'D) She can not know your thoughts unless you offer them to her. He moves off, leaving OLIVER pensive. 
LORD ASHFORD (CONT'D) The ladies Mansfield! As sweet on the eye as the freshest flowers in bloom.... (off Lady M's laughter) What is in those glasses? ON OLIVER as he moves to the pond. In the BG... 
LADY ASHFORD Grenadine syrup... LADY MARY And port!! LADY MANSFIELD Which has gone to my head already! 
ELIZABETH is knelt at the pond's edge with JAMES - a paper boat floats on the water, toppling over to a unanimous cry. 
OLIVER watches as DIDO approaches. His eyes light up. ELIZABETH Oh Dido look - Mr James has made me a boat and it has capsized. JAMES stretches a branch into the lake to rescue the boat. 
DIDO What a dreadful shame. 
OLIVER collects paper from the grass. CLOSE on his hands as he folds it into a boat under DIDO'S nose. OLIVER (to DIDO, earnest) For you. She smiles, can't help being charmed. 
DIDO Thank you. He places it in the water, stands and examines DIDO. From afar, LADY MANSFIELD watches. OLIVER Miss Lindsay, would you do me the honour of taking some air with me, some time? DIDO is dumbstruck - what to say? JAMES is halted. JAMES Don't you care what people will say 
DIDO is jolted by the antangonism in JAMES' tone - ELIZABETH too - it pierces her and she speaks up. ELIZABETH What is that to mean Mr James? What should anyone say?! JAMES hesitates, then... 
JAMES That he should compromise a lady's reputation by stepping out with her - scarcely having made her acquaintance! OLIVER I think you are a great deal too anxious, brother. We should merely take a turn around Vauxhall. DIDO observes JAMES - His protestation is bitter. She traces OLIVER'S features, warmly. DIDO I should be delighted, Mr Oliver! Most delighted. 
60   INT. MANSFIELD CARRIAGE. LONDON STREETS. DAY.10            60    * 
On the move through London streets. LADIES MANSFIELD and MARY sit quietly. ELIZABETH whispers to DIDO. ELIZABETH Are you really to defy Papaa? 
DIDO says nothing, turns to stare out of the window. 
61   EXT. VAUXHALL PLEASURE GARDENS. DUSK/NIGHT.11              61    * 
Teaming with parasols, fountains, and hidden pathways. 61.1: JAMES and ELIZABETH stroll, followed by DIDO and OLIVER, then, LADIES MANSFIELD, MARY, and ASHFORD. 
LADY MANSFIELD (re. Dido with Oliver) I am not at ease with this. Lord Mansfield would be most aggrieved. LADY ASHFORD Oh it can do no harm. This is simply two families, enjoying a day together. LADY MANSFIELD takes an unhappy breath, burdened. 
LADY ASHFORD (CONT'D) Though surely...IF a desirable match were a ... certain... possibility your dear husband could have no objections, could he? LADY MANSFIELD, turns slowly to regard LADY ASHFORD, aroused by the insinuation and alarmed at the same time. She looks back to DIDO and OLIVER, wide eyed. 
OLIVER Well I did not think I would ever find a lady who was not to be conquered or ignored...Until you. DIDO Ah now how do I know this is not just another tactic in your battle to conquer? He stops, takes her hand and places it on in his chest. 
OLIVER See how my heart beats. 
She lets her hand rest a moment. 
OLIVER (CONT'D) I am utterly taken with you, Miss Lindsay. DIDO Despite...such pronounced protestations from your brother? 
JOHN (dismayed) Miss Lindsay, you are alone!! 
DIDO I did not have the chance to see you before you left...Mr Davinier ...to convey my apologies. 
JOHN Apologies...? 
DIDO Your pupilage. Father would never have ended it...you...you never would have had to leave Kenwood were it not... 
His eyes soften as he looks at her... 
JOHN He would make mine a living hell, were he to know of us speaking. DIDO tugs him into a quiet lane, away from the concert and promenading. 
Hardly a breath and BAM!! She is slammed against a walled maze, suddenly!! JOHN pressed against her tightly! Confused, her gaze darts around her, finds LADY MANSFIELD and LADY ASHFORD ambling past along a cross path, oblivious. DIDO freezes - held tightly against JOHN. She stares panicked into his eyes and he into hers. 
61.5:CUTAWAY So they do not see ELIZABETH as she strolls by with JAMES - Her gaze falling on JOHN and DIDO, instantly. 
ELIZABETH is stunned!!!! But doesn't falter. 61.4 CONT'D: As DIDO and JOHN look back - nothing but anonymous strangers, leaving them none the wiser to being discovered. JOHN pulls away, embarrassed... JOHN (CONT'D) Forgive me. She nods, equally bashful. They regard each other. 
DIDO What are you doing here in London Mr Davinier? JOHN I am under a third cousin - a solicitor, here. Nothing more than petty disputes between unsavoury landlords and debauched tenants, but I cannot discount it. DIDO Not what you wished for. JOHN I haven't given up on The Inns. Nothing worth having in life comes easily. DIDO (flushed) Where are my manners? I trust the future Mrs Davinier is well. 
JOHN Very well...thank you. 
DIDO is unexpectedly struck - recovers herself. 
DIDO I have tried to keep up - with the Zong. These past weeks. JOHN (agitated) Tis pitiful! Such inability to simply know what value to put on another's life. DIDO (bitterly) What price, a worthless Negro. 
JOHN (frustrated) You utterly misunderstand me. I am saying that no man may have the value of that of cargo!!! Human beings cannot be priced, since we are priceless!! Freemen and slaves alike! Her eyes begin to sting at the `integrity' in his words. JOHN (CONT'D) (enthused) I am with others here. We are all students in law - applying pressure on the insurance companies to refuse from here on to insure slaves on any ship. A simple clause. DIDO But that would require a change of law. I know nothing but... 
JOHN A change in law - something the insurance companies can lobby for IF they can be persuaded to band together. (softly,) We may only be students, but...change is most always precipitated by the young. (shrugs - poignant) Someone has to have the courage. How can we expect to be civilised if we live in a barbaric world. His words wind her as JOHN shakes his head, frustrated. She takes him in - he is so very handsome! 
JOHN (CONT'D) It is the utter injustice...the industrial slaughter of so many. DIDO stares at him earnestly. DIDO No. It is more than that. It's the shame of a law that would uphold a financial transaction upon that atrocity. She is scathing and accepting all at once, affecting him. JOHN That is indeed the truth. 
Their eyes are locked. An intimate beat that perturbs her. DIDO I have never heard anyone speak like you. JOHN Nor I, you, Miss Lindsay. 
He is emotional, it perturbs him too, now. JOHN (CONT'D) You must return. They will be anxious. Should I follow to see you safely. 
DIDO No we cannot risk it. He nods - studies her.... JOHN Good bye, Miss Lindsay. (he pauses) I suspect, we will never see each other again. The thought strikes DIDO, uneasily. DIDO Good bye, Mr Davinier. 
She turns, preparing herself. JOHN Miss Lindsay?!! (tentative) We...commune at the Coaching Inn - Kentish Town...most evenings.. 
He trails off awkwardly. She falters. 
DIDO Quite. 
She shakes her head, stares through the carriage window. LADY ASHFORD (CONT'D) I must say, pen-ni-less! Thankfully her cousin is not. It is true that on each occasion I lay eyes upon that girl, she becomes more beautiful. 
OLIVER shifts, perturbed - DIDO, indeed, on his mind. 
JAMES She has the colouring of a farmer. 
LADY ASHFORD James, we do not talk about that, any longer. 
JAMES Is this really the very best you aspire to, Oliver? To introduce some woman of obscure birth into the family lineage? LADY ASHFORD James - you are my first boy - blessed by law to inherit your father's wealth. Be sympathetic to your brother. Like the unfortunate Miss Murray - a good family name and empty pockets will only get him so far!! OLIVER closes his eyes, privately humiliated. 
63   INT/EXT. BLOOMSBURY SQ. DRAWING ROOM - DAY.12                63    * 
LADY MANSFIELD looks up from her embroidery - SOUNDS of a carriage rounding into the square. At the window. LADY MANSFIELD Good heavens, Lord Mansfield has arrived a day early! LADY MARY moves quickly to look down on the street. Her POV: below, LORD MANSFIELD'S carriage outside. 
LADY MARY (calls out) Mabel! Freshen the flowers! 
64   INT./EXT. BLOOMSBURY SQ. ENTRANCE HALL - DAY.12              64    * 
A trunk hits the flagstone. A FOOTMAN enters with another. 
65   INT. BLOOMSBURY SQ. BREAKFAST ROOM. DAY.13                   65    * 
A beautifully laid out breakfast - A spray of purple lavender, silver and porcelain. MABEL smiles privately at DIDO as she lays some bread on the table. DIDO watches her leave. DIDO looks to the newly arrived LORD MANSFIELD, as he sits. 
DIDO (facetious) Is Mabel a slave? LADY MANSFIELD almost chokes on her porridge. LORD MANSFIELD I beg your pardon? 
DIDO Is-Mabel-a-slave! LORD MANSFIELD swallows hard, his jaw tightens. 
LORD MANSFIELD She is free and under our protection. 
DIDO (twice as facetious) O! Like me! ELIZABETH Hardly, Dido! LORD MANSFIELD And paid a very respectable wage. 
DIDO takes a mouthful of breakfast, goads her father further. DIDO How is the fraud appeal Papaa? LORD MANSFIELD Fraud? 
DIDO The marine insurance. It is a Fraud case, is it not? LORD MANSFIELD That would depend on to whom you may speak. 
DIDO To cull your `cargo'? To do it solely to claim insurance because it was too diseased to achieve a good price at market? If not fraud, then what? LORD MANSFIELD Do you speak on my behalf, Dido? 
LADY MANSFIELD Oh will you please stop! She slams down her napkin. LADY MANSFIELD (CONT'D) This is a vulgar subject to be discussing at breakfast 
DIDO and LORD MANSFIELD are locked in a stand-off. A bitter silence. LADY MARY ventures to change the subject. 
LADY MARY I learned yesterday that Mr Davinier is in town. DIDO stiffens. ELIZABETH stares across at her, privately. LORD MANSFIELD Makes sense. Dido is beginning to sound very much like him. 
HARRY Mr Davinier? 
JOHN takes a moment - he's alarmed, but somehow, this man is familiar - then...uncertain... 
JOHN Harry? 
78   EXT. COACHING INN/INT.MANSFIELD CARRIAGE. DAY.15            78    * DIDO waits nervously. Suddenly, her breath is taken away as the carriage door opens. JOHN Miss Lindsay! As he climbs inside.    He is stunned, flustered. 
JOHN (CONT'D) I... DIDO Mr Davinier. It makes him breathless just to see her there. A beat passes. 
JOHN I didn't expect...! Are you to come inside?...Are...? DIDO No...It would be dangerous. JOHN (feeling foolish) Yes. Indeed. DIDO Oh Mr Davinier...I am so proud of you. I am so proud of what you are doing and...achieving. 
JOHN No. We've achieved little.... She lifts his face to hers, earnestly. 
DIDO At least thirty per cent of insurers are with you! It is a start. It is a real start. 
They are staring straight into each other's eyes. She pulls her hands away, self consciously. 
DIDO (CONT'D) I have something to show you. She collects the two scrolls beside her, each ribbon tied. She hands one to JOHN, smoothing the other on her lap. DIDO (CONT'D) It is said all of the ship's papers have been `lost'... but...here...I found these in Papaa's library. JOHN What are they? DIDO Papaa's notes on the ship's log. It seems the First Mate has come forward with it - one Mr Stubbs. I could not find the log itself, but look at Papaa's markings - See the map positions - From December 29th, Captain Collingwood and his men directed the ship past no less than eight ports where, you see.... (she points to map) ...there was every opportunity to stop and replenish the ship's water supplies. JOHN studies the log and map together. 
JOHN Good Lord! DIDO And they did not! They either ignored the possibilities, or they were never in need. 
JOHN'S gaze darts from notes to the map, absorbed. JOHN This...This is remarkable. He looks up from the papers.   DIDO is still tentative. 
DIDO Is it? Perhaps if you made these facts known, Mr Davinier JOHN But this places you in an impossible position with Lord Mansfield. 
DIDO What is the alternative? His face searches hers... 
JOHN Walk with me, Miss Lindsay. The back of the Inn has the canals, (he laughs) Nobody but blind drunks. 
79   INT. BLOOMSBURY SQ. DRAWING ROOM. LOW SUN. DAY.15            79    * 
A beautiful light fills the room. MABEL distributes candles as LORD MANSFIELD enters - informal and without wig. LORD MANSFIELD Where is everybody, Mabel? The carriages are gone. MABEL Lady Mansfield and Miss Murray are out calling, your lordship. LORD MANSFIELD And Dido also? MABEL Erm...I believe so. 
LORD MANSFIELD stares at her irritated - peculiar girl! LORD MANSFIELD Well is she, or isn't she? MABEL wavers, attempts to sound convincing. 
MABEL Yes. She is, M'lord. LORD MANSFIELD watches as she stiffly moves from the room. He goes to ask something more...then thinks better of it. 
80   EXT. KENTISH TOWN. CANAL SIDE. LOW SUN:LAST EMBERS.EVE.15 80       * The sun is almost down.   A hooded DIDO walks beside JOHN. 
DIDO Papaa would rather I see no ill, as though by ignoring it, it some how escapes me - perhaps by position but not...not by blood 
JOHN (conciliatory) The fault was never with you. He stops a beat as he catches her gaze on a painted metal sign swinging from the back of an inn. It shows a gent, hat in hand, his black servant bowing behind him. 
81   INT.BLOOMSBURY SQ. ENTRANCE HALL.DUSK: LAST EMBERS.EVE.15 81    * DIDO enters the house, terrified, as she takes off her hood. MABEL passes in the corridor. DIDO Is anyone home, Mabel? 
MABEL Lord Mansfield. (Dido's heart plummets) I said you were out with Lady Mansfield and Miss Murray 
OFF DIDO'S relief/gratitude. She makes her way up the stairs quickly. 
82   INT. BLOOMSBURY SQ. DIDO/ELIZABETH'S BEDROOM - EVE.15     82    * 
ELIZABETH falls back onto her bed, frustrated. 
ELIZABETH Urghhh! What if I shall never find someone so...so incomparably suitable...and wealthy?! DIDO What if he is suitable but you do not feel...`yourself' with him? ELIZABETH Oh Dido! He understood me. (beat) And whenever...whenever... he looked at me...I somehow felt better in this world... 
ELIZABETH'S voice trails. Her words force DIDO to turn away. ELIZABETH (CONT'D) I am convinced his affections were growing...and I feel certain of my own love. 
DIDO Oh Bette, stop it! It is NOT love!! ELIZABETH Dido! You stop it, won't you? You know no more of love than I myself, do you?! (deliberately pointed) Do you Dido? 
She holds her to account - willing DIDO to open up to her. DIDO stares daunted, then... DIDO No. Beat. ELIZABETH swallows hard, disappointed. 
ELIZABETH Then what better right do you have to name what I am feeling than me? OFF DIDO affected. 
83   EXT. LONDON. THAMES RIVER BANKSIDE. DAY.16                   83    * Decandence personified...a beautiful picnic, shaded by trees. Punts float up and down lackadaisically. ELIZABETH listens as LADY MANSFIELD interrogates a gentleman. 
LADY MANSFIELD How charming. Is that not charming, Elizabeth? And tell me, are you an only son? 
GENTLEMAN 1 I have six brothers, madam. 
LADY MANSFIELD'S smile stiffens. 
LADY MANSFIELD SIX! Goodness!...all..? 
He knows where this is going...defeated... GENTLEMAN 1 ...all older, madam, yes. 
Her smile falls away. LADY MANSFIELD Is that not a most fascinating display? He turns to look at the bush of flowers behind him. When he turns back, LADY MANSFIELD and ELIZABETH are gone. 
ON BARONESS VERNON (50s) who passes on a punt, utterly captivated as she waves. Her eyes are on DIDO, stunningly beautiful in fuchsia, beside OLIVER. BARONESS VERNON Oh how dreadfully wonderful Lady M. Your girl is a picture...an utter picture! With her...'intended'? LADY MANSFIELD Indeed, Baroness Vernon. 
BARONESS VERNON (re. ELIZABETH) AND I see the other does not give up...so terribly endearing! 
She stares across at ELIZABETH - ON BETTE'S contempt. BARONESS VERNON (CONT'D) Now has she met Mr Willoughby... 
She points to a gent and leans into the bankside... BARONESS VERNON (CONT'D) A very eligible widower - Three thousand yearly and no heir...yet! 
Her punt moves off as she waves gauche to two gentlemen passing in another. BARONESS VERNON (CONT'D) Mr Francis, Mr Smith...!!! You must meet the Mansfield girl! (She mouths) Still available!! 
ELIZABETH Oh!..Mr James! 
A distressed DIDO follows her gaze back to JAMES. 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) Lady Ashford, you had not mentioned Mr James was to attend! LADY ASHFORD Surprisingly. 
LADY ASHFORD closes her eyes,livid. VAUGHAN stands usurped. JAMES Ladies. (off Dido's reaction) Miss Murray. 
He kisses ELIZABETH'S hand oh so gently, for DIDO'S benefit. LADY MANSFIELD's heart sinks. OFF DIDO, turbulent. 
84   EXT. BLOOMSBURY SQ. DIDO AND ELIZABETH'S BEDROOM. DAY.17   84    * 
DIDO sitting at the window, a sad figure. A MONTAGE OF SHOTS OVER DIFFERENT DAYS FOLLOWS... 
85   EXT. KENTISH TOWN. WATER MILL. DAY.17                      85    * 
A busy area - As workers traipse up and down. JOHN I had never imagined myself to be married. But my aunt is determined. It is true that if one were to count, I had not even been acquainted with Miss Beresford on three occasions. 
DIDO Is she not terribly disappointed that you will not return to Hampstead? 
JOHN (ironic) my Aunt? 
They begin to laugh...it's good to see DIDO laughing. JOHN (CONT'D)JOHN I doubt Miss Beresford has anymore wish to marry me than I her. I should rather make a nuisance of myself alone in London, than in an unwanted marriage in Hampstead... Their laughter carries... 
86   EXT. KENTISH TOWN. BACK ALLEYS. DAY.18                    86    * 
A NEW DAY...bustling, behind the canal. DIDO and JOHN stroll. 
JOHN Were you a curious child? 
DIDO Completely. Elizabeth, always asked the questions for me... then took blame for the impropriety when in fact she was protecting me! Dear, dear Bette. 
Laughter... POV: a pamphlet lies on the ground. It reads: LORD MANSFIELD, THE ZONG AND THE DEATH OF ENGLAND'S TRADE. 
JOHN watches as DIDO takes in the headline... 
87   EXT. KENTISH TOWN. CANAL DAY.19                           87    * 
ANOTHER DAY....ON JOHN and DIDO as they meander. DIDO ...I find myself unable to sleep. Papaa is to finally speak in a few days and...well... JOHN It is quite extraordinary ...but I fear...I fear despite persuasive argument...your Papaa has not been moved. (despondent) I am not certain he is ready to go against the traders - they are some of the most powerful in these Isles - theirs are the finances that hold up England, after all. The enemies of any man who stood against the trade would be vicious. 
DIDO stops, turns JOHN to face her.   She is intense... DIDO And yet if he does...stand up...IF he speaks the words and condemns the trade...The Lord Chief Justice of England...it may be impossible for the slave laws of England and its colonies to remain absolute. Is that correct? 
JOHN That...that is a fact. A tear spills. As JOHN'S hand come up to wipe it away... 
JOHN looks back to HARRY, stunned. HARRY's gaze locks with DIDO'S. She is hurt. He falters, closes the carriage door. DIDO (terrified) Papaa...? LORD MANSFIELD is incandescent. He shakes with rage. 
LORD MANSFIELD This man's ambitions include you. You will endure shame and risk your position for a man without name, who will sully yours and drag your reputation to the gutter! JOHN (bitter and humiliated) I take great offence in your summation of my character without ever even taking a moment to know me. Where is your right? LORD MANSFIELD ...I have EVERY right...! 
JOHN ...No! That you will never have! Not until you cease from judging the entire world as those above and those below and begin to see people as PEOPLE! Human beings, who think and feel no more or less than you do! 
LORD MANSFIELD stands arrested. JOHN'S words strike deep. LORD MANSFIELD I know there is a lady in Belsize who is waiting to be your wife. 
JOHN No! I have an ambitious aunt in Belsize, who like you, assumes reputation and fortune are all that life depends on, and despises love as though it were the devil's own creation! LORD MANSFIELD's eyes narrow dangerously - rage explodes. 
LORD MANSFIELD Love? You claim love....?? 
He reaches for JOHN'S neck. DIDO throws herself at them. 
DIDO NO! STOP! Papaa, you must stop! 
As she struggles to keep them apart. JOHN falls against the door. He shouts at the top of his voice to be heard. 
JOHN Yes...yes I love her! I love her with every breath I breathe. Silence! DIDO and LORD MANSFIELD are stunned. A painful beat. 
DIDO Go John.   You do not deserve this. JOHN'S breath is heavy, his heart pounding. He catches his breath, almost chokes on it as he rises, moving with uncertainty from the carriage, and is gone. DIDO stares at LORD MANSFIELD. 
DIDO (CONT'D) Captain Sir John Lindsay would never have behaved like this. LORD MANSFIELD Captain Sir John Lindsay would never behave like this because he was never HERE!...You are destroying your possibilities with the only gentleman who will consider you. (searching her, hard) Is that what you want? 
No, perhaps it isn't! DIDO stands wavering - daunted. 
103   INT. BLOOMSBURY SQUARE. DRAWING ROOM. NIGHT.21             103     * 
A fist comes down hard on the rosewood table LORD MANSFIELD Arrogant...parasite! HE is filling her with worthless ideals. He wants to `make the world a better place'!... LORD MANSFIELD is puffed with fury as he paces the room. He knocks the table again, jolting LADY MANSFIELD. LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D) He is laughing at us! His childish campaign simply adds to my already rampant ridicule in the gossip pamphlets and now...! As though he were some kind of...saint, immune from reproach! LADY MANSFIELD You said something identical, once. 
LORD MANSFIELD stops in his tracks. LADY MANSFIELD (CONT'D) That you wanted to change the world! Quite some time before you entered your chambers, of course. Defiant, principled...driven. (off Lord M) (MORE) 
LADY MANSFIELD (CONT'D) Desperate to seal your position among the establishment but always a little too radical for them. LORD MANSFIELD I never broke the rules. LADY MANSFIELD Did you not? You simply became powerful enough to make new ones. (off his silence) I always felt you already loved me when I gave you my hand. Not that you said it but... something in the way you looked at me. 
LORD MANSFIELD'S face softens slightly, struck by his wife's words - of course he loved her! He adored her! LADY MANSFIELD (CONT'D) That we were a good match - that was of no doubt...But I am not sure I could have married a gentleman without that...`thing' in his eye...without knowing - privately - that my heart stopped a moment each time he looked at me Their eyes are locked. She speaks carefully. LADY MANSFIELD (CONT'D) It is possible that even you cannot fight change, my darling... And sometimes you cannot fight it because you are a part of it. Her words resonate, shifting him into thought. LADY MANSFIELD (CONT'D) Do you love her? 
His eyes fill. What he says next is deeply heartfelt... LORD MANSFIELD As though she were created of you and I...(poignant)...And that is why I simply do not want to see her diminished. 
104   INT. BLOOMSBURY SQUARE. DRAWING ROOM. DAY.22              104   * 
Like subjects of a pastel Joshua Reynolds painting, the MANSFIELD ladies are draped around the room . LADY MARY uses a dainty magnifying glass to read a pamphlet as LADY MANSFIELD sips tea, ELIZABETH reads and DIDO gazes out of the window...LADY MARY reads aloud. 
LADY MARY The niece of the Marquess of Winchester. Mr James Ashford is to marry the niece of the Marquess of Winchester. ELIZABETH looks up, bewildered. 
LORD MANSFIELD swallows hard.   LADY MANSFIELD's gaze falls. DIDO (CONT'D) Her apparent crime, to be born negro, and mine - to be the evidence. (beat) Since I wish to deny her no more than I wish to deny myself, you will pardon me for wanting a husband who feels `forgiveness' of my bloodline is both unnecessary and without grace. 
ON the astonished ASHFORD faces. 
108   INT. BLOOMSBURY SQUARE. STAIRS/GROUND FL HALLWAY. DAY.23 108     * DIDO steps from the room, shaken...what has she just done?! LADY MARY approaches, intuitively hands DIDO a hankerchief. 
109   EXT: KENTISH TOWN CANAL. DAY.23                           109    * 
Wide on the canal, bustling with life - the poor and working classes. - FIND JOHN sitting alone, forlorn. 
110   INT. BLOOMSBURY SQ. MARBLE ROOM. DAY.24                     110    * 
A canvas stands hidden under hemp fabric. ZOFFANY stands beside it. LORD MANSFIELD before him... 
111   EXT. BLOOMSBURY SQUARE. GARDENS. CONTINUOUS. DAY.24         111    * DIDO surrounded by Summer blooms. She reads a poetry book. 
112   INT. BLOOMSBURY SQUARE. MARBLE ROOM. CONTINUOUS. DAY.24     112    * As ZOFFANY carefully removes the hemp - a series of actions slowly uncovering his painting. We do not see it revealed. 
113   INT. BLOOMSBURY SQUARE. GARDENS. CONTINUOUS. DAY.24         113    * 
As DIDO repeats a sentence from the book to herself. 
DIDO Why did I, slave, beyond my lot aspire.. The line repeats itself in her head. 
114   INT. BLOOMSBURY SQUARE. MARBLE ROOM. CONTINUOUS. DAY.24     114    * 
LORD MANSFIELD before the painting, shielding it from us. ON ZOFFANY as his eyes fall on the window. LORD MANSFIELD follows his gaze, to DIDO alone in the gardens, reading. 
POV: THROUGH THE WINDOW, as DIDO feels their gaze. She falters. Her eyes dart through the glass, beyond LORD MANSFIELD, to the canvas....The sight causes her to stand - drawn to the window to see more clearly. The camera, too, draws in on the portrait, now. And as it is revealed to DIDO, so too, is it finally revealed to us. 
It is a serenely sensitive representation of two delicate English ladies - one part black, as they stand as equals, against Kenwood's iconic gardens. 
CLOSE on DIDO, shaken, taking in the extraordinary image. Off both men, each as moved as she is. 
115   INT. BLOOMSBURY SQUARE. MARBLE ROOM. DAY.24                 115    * 
The camera hovers on the painting - The image of ELIZABETH'S delicate hand laying gently on DIDO'S arm. 
LORD MANSFIELD (OOV) It will hang at Kenwood. DIDO Will it? LORD MANSFIELD Why should that surprise you? 
DIDO Why should it not? LORD MANSFIELD says nothing, observes her, curious. LORD MANSFIELD What are you reading? 
DIDO Poetry. A gentleman named Thomas Day. He speaks of a slave who agreed to marry a free woman. A voice to people...people like my mother - who do not have one. 
LORD MANSFIELD Dido. 
JOHN If you find for the traders, you will be formalizing in law the concept of insuring `human' cargo. 
LORD MANSFIELD climbs into his carriage. LORD MANSFIELD That is correct!...(to his driver)...Drive! The carriage begins to move off.   JOHN walks alongside it. 
JOHN Then know that when you are gone, your legacy will be to have left Miss Lindsay in a world that says she may be worth more dead, than alive. LORD MANSFIELD She is not a slave. JOHN By the very grace of God! 
The words provoke LORD MANSFIELD. He stands, slamming his hand to the driver's wall. The carriage halts abruptly. 
JOHN stands at the carriage window, breathless. LORD MANSFIELD looks down at him furious, suddenly disarmed by the emotion in JOHN'S eyes. 
LORD MANSFIELD This is not about Miss Lindsay. JOHN is confused, flustered. JOHN Of course it is! It's about all of us. It's about everything... everything that is important! 
LORD MANSFIELD searches JOHN, palpably affected now. He doesn't want to show JOHN his empathy, fights it - but for a split second it escapes in the profound silence. He recovers himself - considers his words before he speaks quietly - as though from personal experience... LORD MANSFIELD Mr Davinier, the world is a devastating place. You must learn to protect your emotions if you are to prevent matters of both law..and love from devastating you. JOHN is frozen, averts his gaze. LORD MANSFIELD regards him, affected, bangs on the carriage again and is gone. 
OFF JOHN, shaken. 
119   INT. BLOOMSBURY SQ. ENTRANCE HALL AND STAIRS. DAY.26      119      * 
POV: looking down at the sweeping stairs and entrance hall. LADY MANSFIELD Smooth your dress, young lady! 
LADY MANSFIELD pinches ELIZABETH'S cheeks. LADY MARY fusses anxiously The bell chimes. ELIZABETH'S excitement rises. She steals a glance up the stairs to REVEAL DIDO surreptitiously watching. The BUTLER sweeps by MR VAUGHAN (OOV) Lady Mansfield...Miss Murray... 
As MR VAUGHAN enters Elizabeth descends into a curtsey. LADY MANSFIELD Mr Vaughan, how kind of you to come. ELIZABETH I have thought of nothing else but showing you Aunt Mary's chrysanthemums, Mr Vaughan. MR VAUGHAN What a pleasure, Miss Murray. ELIZABETH You too Mamaa. 
She drags them away, sending DIDO a final surreptitious glance that says, the coast is clear for her. As she does, LADY MARY'S gaze follows - sees DIDO hiding. A beat. LADY MARY hangs back - smiles satisfied to herself, before moving off. 
120   EXT. BLOOMSBURY SQUARE. MANSFIELD HOME.   DAY.26             120   * 
A hooded DIDO steps from the house. HARRY's heart sinks. 
HARRY NO! Never again! 
DIDO Fine! Then step down and allow me to take the reigns. 
Harry rubs his eyes, burdened. Then...far from jovial.. HARRY Had I known you were to be such trouble, I'd `ave driven off before Captain Sir John Lindsay bought you to my carriage! 
121   EXT. WESTMINSTER HALL. LONDON. DAY.26                        121   * 
A myriad of people flood into the court - politicians, clergy, shipping merchants, abolitionists...and insurers. DIDO steps from the carriage. 
122   INT. WESTMINSTER HALL. LONDON. CONTINUOUS. DAY.26            122   * As they pour through the doors, we settle first on LORD ASHFORD, then, JOHN DAVINIER, pushing into the room. CUT TO:

Screenplay by Oliver Stone 
Based on The Autobiography by Billy Hayes with William Hoffer 
Revised Draft June, 1977 
PROLOGUE BLACK SCREEN - SUPERIMPOSE: 
THE FOLLOWING IS BASED ON A TRUE STORY. 
IT OCTOBER 6, 1970 ISTANBUL, 
TURKEY - 
SOUND UNDER, SHARP: CRACKLE - RIP - SNIP... 
FADE IN: 
A SET OF CLOTHES ON A HOTEL ROOM BED -- trenchcoat, bulky white turtle-neck sweater, T-shirt, jeans, Western style boots.  SOUNDS continue, Accentuated.  MOVE Across open TRAVEL BAGS On The bed.  Clothes, possessions.  CONTINUE Across FURNITURE, WASHBASIN, TOILET...A large room, high old ceilings And windows suggesting Ancient Europe & design, A haunting greenish AFTERNOON light. 
We MOVE to HANDS, TIGHT - drawing out a strip of adhesive tape, 
SCISSORS move in TIGHT...SNIP! 
UNDERARM, TIGHT.  Tape being laid over it. 
BACK OF SHOULDER.  TIGHT.  Tape going on. 
BELLYBUTTON, TIGHT. TAPE going Then: a harsh RIP! SOUND and the tape comes off the bellybutton. 
HANDS with new strip of tape. Moving to: 
HASHISH PLAQUE. Four of them, thinly pressed. One on top of the other. The HAND wrapping a portion of the TAPE around them and: 
BELLY, TIGHT. SOUNDS of BREATHING stop. The belly is sucked in. The TAPE is pulled HARD across, then CLINCHED.  We hear F.X. of HEART BEAT-- 
MOVE UP THE CHEST TO: 
BILLY HAYES - 21, baby-face, attractive, medium build an aura of innocence. His eyes moving off his belly to: 
MIRROR.  FULL SHOT.  Climax.  A creature in a bondage of his own devise, he is naked in his underpants, his body criss-crossed by a network of TAPE and 40 tightly pressed plaques of HASHISH in every conceivable crevice of his body. The eyes are hard. 
NIX THROUGH HEART BEAT, SOUNDS OF AIRPORT. 
CUT: 
INTERIOR 
ISTANBUL AIR TERMINAL dirty, crowded, wooden benches, peddlers.  Turkish flight instructions on LOUDSPEAKER, followed by mediocre English translations. NOTE: ALL DIALOGUE IN TURKISH TO FOLLOW WILL BE MARKED OFF BY PARENTHESIS. A CERTAIN WILL BE SUBTITLED, BUT SOME NOT. 
LOUDSPEAKER VOICE Pan American Flight 1 to Frankfurt, London, and New York has arrived and will be ready for boarding at Gate 7 in 20 minutes. 
REPEAT IN ENGLISH over: 
BILL walking down a long CORRIDOR. He moves somewhat stuffly in the clothes we saw laid out on the bed; his face complicated by dark, rather ridiculous aviator sunglasses and an increasing edge of nervousness to his actions. With him is: 
SUSAN 23, healthy outdoor looks, dressed casually colorful like an American student abroad. 
APPROACHING P.O.V. - a group of TURKISH SECURITY GUARDS, in rumpled green uniforms, at a security CHECKPOINT inspect the carry-on bags of several PASSENGERS. 
BILLY tensely contemplating the guards as he walks. 
SUSAN digging in her bag for her passport as she walks. 
BILLY, looking from guards ahead to SUSAN. He suddenly breaks stride, still a fair distance from the checkpoint. SUSAN glances at him. He is holding his belly. 
BILLY I think I've been poisoned. 
SUSAN And you ate two baclavas, right? I not to touch them, mine was awful. 
BILLY (his voice strained) Look, I think I'm going to have to go to the john again.  You go on through, I'll catch up. 
With a sense of panic, he turns and goes back down the corridor without waiting for a response.  SUSAN concerned, moves on. 
CUT: 
BILLY in the  WASHROOM MIRROR, again checks himself out. His glasses are off, and he has just watered himself down. But the SOUND of his HEARTBEAT is up, and his nerves are visible in his eyeballs and he knows it.  He dabs at the sweat on his sideburns.  He closes his eyes, takes a DEEP BREATH.  A pause. He puts his dark sunglasses back on. Turns away from the mirror.  No going back now. 
ADVANCING P.O.V. - SECURITY CHECKPOINT.  The GUARDS again. Closer, closer, Guns in their HOLSTERS. SOUND of billy's heartbeat, 
CLOSE - GUARD smoking a cigarette, bored, uniform, looks at BILLY. 
CUT: 
The GUARDS again.SOUND of Billy's in a tattered olive 
VARIOUS PASSENGERS What's he saying?  I don't know... Marian.  Hey Marian, what the hell... 
The Turkish-speaking PASSENGERS are gathering together their items and beginning to exit as: 
POLICE OFFICER repeats, in ENGLISH 
POLICE OFFICER Idem. 
CLOSE BILLY. The POLICE OFFICER is only beginning the speech.in English but already Billy realizes, And it's panic.  Silent panic. That horrendous cold feeling all over his back: Oh God what have I done, what can I do now? He freezes. 
MOVE TO SUSAN rising, fetching her things, irritated. 
SUSAN Jesus, they do everything ass backwards in Turkey. 
Behind her we see the other AMERICAN PASSENGERS beginning to disembark with the usual chorus of overlapped conversations, expletives, including: 
PASSENGERS They're checking for hijackers. Any Palestinians aboard? Hey Harry, get rid of your grenades... 
Laughter is returned from several of the American contingent, but we MOVE BACK to BILLY in foreground; all of a sudden he is on his knees trying to crawl under the seat. 
SUSAN (OFF) Billy, what's the matter? 
BILLY My passport! 
SUSAN No! 
She bends down to look, coming FACE TO FACE with him. He grips her arm. 
BILLY (low voice) Susan - forget it. Go get us a seat on the plane. Now. 
SUSAN (picking up the real fear in his voice) What is it? . . . Billy? 
BILLY (a fierce whisper, panic) For Christ's sake, just GET on the plane, okay! 
His tone stuns her; never before has he spoken to her like that.  A LOOK between them; he has his glasses off now. She's not a stupid girl by any means and realizes something is very wrong and for the both of them, she'd best do exactly as he says. And fast.  She moves OUT OF SHOT. 
BILLY, crouched low in the aisle starts to work fast, his finger: shaking reaching into his sweater starting to work the TAPE loose from around his chest; looking from under the bench. Still quite a bit of commotion as passengers are exiting. BUT THEN: 
BILLY P.O.V. - UNIFORMED LEGS coming slowly down Isle Towards him. The muzzle of An M-l RIFLE tapping loosely Against the side of the kneecap. 
PAN WITH and MOVE UP as TURKISH MILITARY LIEUTENANT comes into view, intersecting outgoing PASSENGERS, eyes casually coming to rest on: 
BILLY looks up from his kneeling position on floor; his sweater rolled back down; he indicates the passport in his hand. "Just found it" expression. 
MOVE to the LIEUTENANT not necessarily suspecting anything, but with a customary insolence reserved for young vagrant- types, he stretches his rifle arms length with one hand and gently prods Billy up with the tip of the muzzle placed under his chin. MOVE BACK to the OFFICER, bringing the rifle back to his side, indicating Billy get off the bus with the others. All in silence. 
CUT: 
BILLY among a group of MALE PASSENGERS funnelling into two lines that pass on either side of a wooden inspection table. Thirty TURKISH SOLDIERS with rifles ring the area. It is open, vast, no place to run or hide. The only apparent hope is to melt into their regular jostling patterns of the passengers impatiently waiting. 
TWO PLAINCLOTHESMEN (Police) are on each side of the table, body-searching the male passengers alternately. 
SUSAN is in a similar set-up twenty yards away, with FEMALE ATTENDANTS doing the searching. She glances at Billy as she undergoes search. She is cleared, passes on, towards the ramp of the plane. 
BILLY, his sunglasses off, smoothly melts among the male PASSENGERS pulling some books from his shoulder bag.  Glides to the head of the line. MOVE TO: 
The FIRST OFFICER patting down a PASSENGER, his back partially turned to Billy. MOVE AROUND bringing him into foreground as: 
BILLY skirts him in the background, camouflaged among two other conversing PASSENGERS waiting for the SECOND OFFICER who now appears in foreground on the lateral TRACK; he is busy with another passenger. In passing him, Billy replaces the books in his shoulder bag as though he had already been searched by the first officer, 
Tension. FOLLOW BILLY as he approaches the boarding ramp. 
BILLY P.O.V. - SUSAN at the top of the ramp waiting. Smiling STEWARDESSES. Pan America. Haven. 
BILLY - FOOT rising off Turkish soil onto ramp. 
TURKISH HAND lightly touching Billy's elbow, then grasping the ARM. 
TURK (OFF) Just a minute! 
BILLY his eyes flattening. 
SUSAN in LONG SHOT, reacting. 
BILLY turns trying to seem casual; he confronts the SECOND OFFICER face to face and gestures towards the: 
FIRST OFFICER who happens to glance at them. 
SECOND Nebu? Did you search him? 
FIRST OFFICER (frowns) No! 
SECOND OFFICER tightens his grip on BILLY, angry, and pulls him back to the TABLE. MOVE with them. The officer has been lied to; in addition he is young, inexperienced, about eighteen. 
SECOND OFFICER (grunts a command, makes a gesture) 
BILLY, comprehending, spreads his arms.  The OFFICER pats him down carefully, brushing against his armpits. Precisely in the area where we saw the hashish. But incredibly he doesn't notice, continuing to work his way down the hips and legs. 
Tex glances at him, questioningly. 
BILLY She didn't know anything about...I wouldn't have wanted her to. 
TEX Lucky girl. 
Billy leans back in seat, blowing out the cigarette smoke. 
BILLY Jeez, she used to say I was the lucky one. 
TEX Let's hope so, Billy.  Let's sure hope so. 
A narrow cobblestone STREET.  TEX pulls the car to a halt. 
CUT: 
THE PUDDING SHOPPE TWILIGHT Internationally-known cafe, adjacent BAZAAR. Crowded, noisy. WOMEN dressed in black hold crying CHILDREN by the hands. FOREIGNERS, mostly students and hippies, move about laughing, joking. Hawkers, street peddlers, vendors cooking shishkebab.  small GYPSY BOY leads a huge MUZZLED BEAR on a leash. 
BILLY sits at a small outdoor TABLE alone sipping tea and eating baclava - nervous, very nervous, still trying to sort it all out in his head. If he doesn't find the seller, what will happen next? 
MOVE across the TABLES, past a middle-aged AMERICAN COUPLE, to TWO TURKISH PLAINCLOTHESMEN watching him closely. They look evident. TWO HIPPIES make a wide berth around them. 
HIPPIES (OFF) (in passing, low) Hey Janet, why don't you go sell 'em some dope. 
MOVE ON to another TABLE where TWO MORE PLAINCLOTHESMEN sit, equally evident, watching BILLY. 
TEX sits in his car, in the distance, casually glancing at a newspaper. 
BILLY's eyes rove. 
INTERIOR PUDDING SHOPPE Large. Many tables. Stairs. A back exit. 
ANOTHER GYPSY BOY leads a huge PINK PIG leashed with a wooden sign around its neck proclaiming "Pig" in Turkish. Various TURKS point the pig out, laughing at it, some disgusted by it, making faces and gestures: "Go way, go way!  "Ayip!"  The PIG moves past BILLY, who shifts his gaze to: 
POV - CABDRIVER #1 lingering at the curb. PAN to CABDRIVER #2  PAN to CABDRIVER #3. PAN BACK to #1 and again to #2 indicating no real fix on identity. 
BILLY tense now, knowing this is the chance he must take, nods with his head, pointing at CABDRIVER #2, off. 
THE PLAINCLOTHESMEN move out towards CABDRIVER #2. 
BILLY tentatively rises, as if to join them, but moves slyly towards the interior of the cafe. 
PLAINCLOTHESMEN move in roughly on a surprised CABDRIVER #2 who begins to protest LOUDLY (AD LIB). 
BILLY moves through the INTERIOR of the PUDDING SHOPPE, past the tables, past the stairs, towards the back of the shop, at a normal.to attract attention. 
A PLAINCLOTHESMAN looks around, sees he is gone. Tells the others (AD LIB) They spread out looking, abandoning the CABDRIVER #2 who spits and curses them (AD LIB). 
BILLY, with one backward glance, now eases out the BACK DOOR, into a bilious sunlight, onto a STREET. Pause. 
A HAND with GUN moves into FRAME pointing a six-inch barrel right at his temple.  BILLY freezes, moving just his eyes to: 
TEX looking down at him calm, merciless. 
TEX You seem like a nice enough kid to me Billy, but try it and I'll blow your fucking brains out. 
BILLY - the sense of betrayal in his eyes. 
ESTABLISH PRISON - OVERHEAD ANGLE. A large and Byzantine structure suggesting the 15th Century Sultan's Janissary Barracks. Irregular crescent various wings; a MOSQUE inside the prison. The possibly a shapes to the sense of an endless a decorative an equally in a city, labyrinth built by some mad Arab architect to suit purpose and now, in the 20th Century, transformed by mad Turkish bureaucracy into a prison. It should be preferably made to look like Istanbul. 
Faint background atonal Turkish CHANTING. Evening Muslim prayer."Allah wakbah, Allah wakbah..." on and on, suggesting to us fear rather than praise. 
BILLY VOICE Dear Mom and Dad. This is the hardest letter I've ever had to write. know the confusion and the pain it will cause you.  And the disappointment... 
BILLY - his scalp being shaved off by a prison BARBER in an un-specified ANTI-CHAMBER, His eyes are staring dead ahead. 
BILLY VOICE (continuous) I really thought knew what I was doing with my life. I'd hoped somehow to get out of this quickly so that you'd never know about it. But that just isn't possible now. I don't know what's going to happen. But what can I say to you?  Will 'I'm sorry' make a difference? Will it ease the pain, the shame you must be feeling?  Forgive me...Please... 
BILLY is now completely BALD, SOUND SHARP OVER: 
CUT: 
A CELL DOOR SLIDING OPEN. BILLY steps in, bewildered. 
ZIAT VOICE (OFF) Git! 
The cell is dark, almost black, an overpowering stench; a small grey metal bunk is bolted to the floor with a lumpy mattress. BILLY turns, looking back at the man staring at him from the door. 
ZIAT is quickly summing up Billy's character. This is his craft.He is a prisoner and trustee. sinister man whose one motivation in life is the accumulation of money, in the pursuit of which he has acquired an ugly purplish SCAR running the width of his throat, various other facial SCARS; and one blind milky white EYE. He's stocky and strong -- about five ten, with bushy eyebrows, brown cigarette teeth, big dirty nails, repulsively in need of a bath. What's surprising is that he is no more than thirty years old looks and behaves like sixty. The personification of the denaturalization of a man. Time, body, mind - all of them warped. 
BILLY, not yet attuned to his nature, only repulsed, is still wearing his own clothes and makes a shivering gesture, enunciating very clearly, hoping he will understand. 
BILLY Cold. Very cold. Can I get blanket? Blanket? (makes a gesture of a blanket wrapped around him) 
ZIAT smiles, showing his stained teeth, and starts to slide shut the cell door on its ROLLER. 
ZIAT (in English) Mo sell...Too late.  Tomorrow... 
Raises the club. 
BILLY tries to block it with his hand, and the CLUB smashes his thumb.  SCREAM. 
SHARP CUT: 
BILLY is hoisted upside-down in his UNDERPANTS ONLY with thick rope tied about his ankles, the legs spread - onto a PULLEY suspended from the ceiling. He is yanked upwards, then lowered slightly, his head and backs of shoulders banging against the stone floor. 
THE PULLEY is LOCKED into place.  (LOUD SOUND) 
BILLY has this surprised look on his face still, through the tears.  What's happening? 
Hamidou motions the GUARDS out of the room (AD LIB).  Turns back to BILLY, raises his club. 
BRINGS IT DOWN FORCE on the soles of BILLY'S BARE FEET. SCREAM.  He cocks the club again. 
BILLY twists To avoid The blow 
CLUB catches him On The ANKLEBONE 
BILLY SCREAMs louder than ever as we hear The SOUND of wood On bone.  Whimpering SOUNDS follow. 
BILLY looking through teary eyes, sure now that he is going to be killed. The CLUB - OFF - smacks sole skin with the same force as the first blow. No let up. 
CUT: 
BILLY still in the same position, vomits all over himself. 
HAMIDOU SPINS the PULLEY to a new position bringing: 
BILLY into a steeper, more vertical position.  He is on the verge of fainting, bleary-eyed, looking as: 
HAMIDOU moves around in between his legs. Doing something indistinct with the stick between his legs, then dropping the stick. Then, with this bizarrely excited expression on his hairless face, he begins to undo his own pants. But, for Billy, it all BLURS OUT TO: 
JAPANESE SILK SCREEN depicting a fat jovial Buddhist monk, fishing placidly by a stream. Then moves to soap carvings of chess pieces Then a bed-sheet hung as a curtain with astrological symbols paint; on it.  SOUND OFF, of a blaring radio.  Atonal TURKISH MUSIC. 
VOICE (close, intense) Hey man, he's gotta walk, or his feet gonna swell up worse. 
2ND VOICE (softer, sonorous, Swedish accent) We take him down to courtyard... 
Then: ERICH - a gentle long bird's face. Long whitish-blond- hair, Swedish, well above six feet, 25. 
Another FACE moves into view JIMMY BELL, American, 23 fiery eyes, black hair and moustache, intense, strong. 
BELL Smoke this rocket, it'll cool the pain. 
ANOTHER ANGLE - BELL puts a huge cone-shaped JOINT with aluminium foil filter into BILLY'S LIPS. He hardly knows what it is, Puffing weakly. Though dehydrated and his face white without color, he has no facial markings. 
BELL You gotta walk around some man, or your feet gonna swell up something bad... 
BILLY looks down at 
HIS FEET Bloated black and blue with inflamed red points in various spots. A vicious bruise on his anklebone. ERICH is running a cold rag from a basin of water over them, his fingers tender. 
BELL (OVER) You've been out for days man, talking all kinds of shit. Come on, we'll walk you down to the courtyard. 
BELL eases BILLY up from the bed, as ERICH puts a pair of clip-clops on his feet. 
ERICH Okay? 
BILLY nods. They rise together, bracing his shoulder. BILLY adjusting to the sensation of standing. 
ERICH How's it feel? 
BILLY (dizzy) About as good as it looks. 
BELL Getchmis olsun 
BILLY Getchmis...? 
BELL Olsun - "May it pass quickly." I'm Bell, Jimmy Bell. This is Erich something Swedish. 
ERICH (smiling) Just Erich. 
BILLY I'm Billy Hayes... At least I used to be. 
Looks around. 
A DORMITORY TYPE ROOM with 24 bunk beds set head to head in horizontal fashion, cramped and with minimal privacy. A narrow WALKWAY leading towards a TOILET AREA and STAIRCASE. 
BILLY Looks like a cheap hotel. 
BELL Yeah... Only the room service is lousy.  Come on, let me show you the tennis courts. 
Helps him with ERICH to take the first steps. 
THE COURTYARD. The THREE of them emerge in a thin AFTERNOON sun, Billy now disengaging and hobbling on his own power. 
ERICH New people sometimes get on his nerves. 
BILLY (lifeless) What did he do? 
ERIC He was caught steeling from a Mosque.  That's heavy here.  He got 30 years. 
BILLY Thirty years? 
ERICH Jimmy has more balls than brains. He didn't tell his parents he was in jail for a year and a half.  He says he got himself in and now he's going to get himself out. 
He shakes his head, looking at: 
BELL him across the courtyard huddling with a cigarette, bartering angrily. a raggedy GUARD giving him a cigarette, bartering angrily. 
BILLY and ERICH. 
BILLY And you? 
ERICH Hashish.  Ninety percent of the foreigners are in for hashish. 
They walk. 
BILLY What they give you? 
ERICH (passive) Twelve years. 
Billy stops. 
BILLY How much did you have? 
ERICH A hundred grams. 
BILLY (appalled) It's not fair! 
Even ERICH has to smile now. 
ERICH There is no fair in Turkey, Billy. It's all "sula-bula" like this, like that. An Italian hippie had a car accident and a Turk was killed. SO, they threw him in here for six months... 
BILLY That doesn't seem so bad. 
ERICH But he was eating lunch a mile away when the Turk smashed into killed himself. 
BILLY He wasn't even in the car? 
ERICH (shakes his head) Aslan, there... (points) 
ASLAN - a young big fat heavily moustached Turk, wearing a black silk double-breasted business suit, grotesque cuff- links, heavily pomaded hair, is huddling in a section of the YARD with FIVE other grinning GANGSTER TYPES, all in suits. 
ERICH (OVER) Killed a guy. But his father's a big gangster on the docks.  A "Kapidiye."  He'll stay in... twelve months no more, and get parole. In Turkey, murder is manly - "erkek". 
ERICH Glances back at BILLY 
ERICH You just got to get yourself a good lawyer.  And some money... Talk to Max.  He's been in the longest. 
BILLY How long? 
ERICH Seven years... 
CUT: 
MAX - "Eskilet" (skeleton). British, tall, straggly long hair with wire spectacles set crookedly over his nose. An earing in one ear. The far away eyes of an international junkie, preoccupied and uninterested in small talk. Tough in his skinny way, like apiece of old dried leather. 
He occupies with his YOUNG STRIPED CAT a bunk in the far corner of the SECOND FLOOR KOGUS - in the process of shooting himself up with "Gastro" a smelly brown liquid stomach medicine.  No one is in the vicinity except 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
ERICH and BILLY who watches repelled as MAX fumbles with a piece of twine tied around his arm in a tourniquet, searching for an unused spot amid dirty infected track marks. PLUNGES the needle in, pumping in the black gunk. Glances at BILLY. 
MAX (smiles) Gastro.  Stomach medicine. Has codeine in it... Best can do 
Pulls out the needle, loosens the tourniquet. His eyes take on a far away stare. 
ERICH Lawyers? 
MAX Yeah... there's no straight lawyers in Turkey... They're all bent bent as hairpins... 
Gives a spoon with a taste of the black residue to: 
HIS CAT who is full of spunk, and tries to catch Max's HAND. 
He looks at BILLY, not remembering him. 
ERICH His name? 
MAX Who? 
ERICH The lawyer? 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
FATHER Don't worry about it.  Right now money doesn't count. Okay? 
A pause. YESIL Shifts, Throats are cleared. BILLY moves to sit down, limping faintly; he is wearing sneakers and the bruises don't show. 
FATHER Where'd you get that limp? 
BILLY (not wanting to alarm him) Nothing. Just twisted my ankle. 
Sits down at the conference TABLE. 
BILLY Where you staying, Dad? 
FATHER (pulls up a seat next to Billy) The Hilton. 
BILLY How do you like it?  Istanbul? 
FATHER Well, it's an interesting place... (lowers his voice, a hint of a smile) Tell you the truth, I think the food is lousy. The crap they sell in these little restaurants. I went out to eat in one of them last night, and I had to run to the damn toilet... You shoulda' seen the toilet. 
BILLY laughs. 
BILLY You mean you got toilets? 
FATHER is happy to see his son laugh. 
FATHER Yeah, with real toilet paper - and you don't have to use both sides. 
BILLY laughs again. 
FATHER So now I'm eating at the Hilton every night. 
BILLY smiles. A pause. A worried look returns to the Father's face 
FATHER Why'd you do it, Billy? 
BILLY For the money... (Looks away)) 
FATHER (sighs) I know you kids smoke that stuff, and we drink booze, but taking it across a border - it was stupid, Billy. Stupid. 
BILLY I know. 
Glances at DAVIS, YESIL back to his father, his voice beginning to tremble, ashamed of himself for letting it show. 
BILLY Dad get me out of here. 
ANOTHER ANGLE. The FATHER understands the desperation in his voice, puts his hand on his son's. 
FATHER I promise you, Billy. Just sit tight and don't.. DON'T do anything stupid.  Let me work with Mr. Yesil and Mr. Davis.  We'll get you out... Okay?  Billy, okay? 
All the assurance of the world is written in this kindly Irishman's face. 
BILLY feels it. 
BILLY being led by TWO GUARDS down a huge arched CORRIDOR in the COURTROOM BUILDING. 
BILLY Okay. 
CUT: 
PROSECUTOR VOICE (OVER) THE world is now looking at Turkey. We are called the Heroin Supplier of the world.  Stories about us are in newspapers and on television every day all around the world. The time has come, your Honor, to alter this image before we find ourselves isolated and morally ostracized by the rest of the human race... 
THE COURTROOM - monolithic, frightening, immense with cross- currents of greenish light from the enormous windows. People seem insignificant. 
THE PROSECUTOR, wearing dark green glasses, continues, scowling, gesturing profusely at: 
BILLY in the PRISONERS DOCK, baroque design, isolated. Doesn't understand a thing, Erich's extra-large blue pin- striped suit makes him look rather absurd. 
HIS FATHER, CONSUL DAVIS, YESIL and ANOTHER LAWYER are seated together at the defence table conferring in low tones with each other. YESIL looks over at BILLY with a big reassuring grin, nods his head - nothing to worry about. 
TURKISH GIRL from the Press with a yellow legal pad, makes notes in the Spectator Gallery. Her legs flare out from a short skirt. 
BILLY pries his eyes away to: 
PROSECUTOR continuing in front of the THREE JUDGES high on an Alice in Wonderland podium wearing long black robes with scarlet collars. One of the Judges is bald, the other has his eyes closed, could be asleep. The CHIEF JUDGE in the middle has a sagging somewhat kindly face and short grey hair.  A YOUNG MAN below the podium, is clacking at an ancient typewriter on a small table. 
PROSECUTOR VOICE (OVER) (continuous) ...We must alter this image by punishing only our own drug smugglers-but by handing out foreigners who infest our culture with their depravity ungodly and behavior.  We must start now - by sentencing this American, Vilyum Hi-yes, to the maximum sentence for smuggling, to be held up to the light of the world as an example of Turkish justice and its intention to halt the drug trade once and for all.. .I ask the Court therefore to sentence Vilyum Hi-yes to Life Imprisonment. 
He sits, staring malignantly at BILLY. 
THE JUDGES rise. 
JUDGE Thank you, Prosecutor. The Court will now recess to consider its verdict. 
The JUDGES exit. 
ANOTHER ANGLE, General commotion in the courtroom as people move about. The FATHER and DAVIS and the OTHER LAWYER consult among themselves, the FATHER vigorously nodding his head.  YESIL approaches BILLY. 
It sputters out of his mouth, senseless to: 
HAMIDOU who closes the door. He has an angry glint in his eye. 
CUT: 
BILLY lies on his bunk at night deeply depressed, paler. Candlelight flutters softly against the stone walls. A PHOTO of SUSAN taken outdoors with a mountain range in the background, is on his wall with various SOAP CARVINGS of little chess piece she has designed. 
In the distance, very faintly coming upwards into our sound consciousness we hear a TRAIN WHISTLING in the night, on an old railroad track bypassing the prison walls. Two whistles.  Chugging. Then passing off. The Midnight Express. 
BILLY'S VOICE Dear Susan.  1970 has now passed into 1971.  You can drift in here and never know you're gone. You can fade so far out and you don't know where you are anymore or where anything else is... 
The CAMERA DRIFTS around the SECOND STORY KOGUS revealing the sleepers: ERICH, BELL, MAX... 
BILLY'S VOICE (continuous) I find loneliness is a physical pain which hurts all over; you can't isolate it in one part of your body. I so much need your softness, your strength. I have your letters. They charge me, give me courage.News about amnesty and getting out - tangled, complicated... 
The CAMERA LINGERS on ZIAT in a far corner of the Kogus, top bunk, against a wall.  Never secure, he shuffles in his sleep. 
VOICE ...I feel myself drifting more heavily into smoking hashish. The haze helps the time pass. Also I do soap carvings.  Erich taught me. And I have been learning Turkish because it helps me to deal with the guards and the prisoners. I'm trying hard to maintain some sort of schedule to my life, but sometimes it seems like I'm just trying in order to try... 
ZIAT is evidently awake he pulls his RADIO over into the bed, and peering around to make sure no one is watching, here moves the screws from the back of it, pulls off the cover and puts in a sheaf of large denomination GERMAN MARKS: inside we briefly glimpse a wad of different-colored CURRENCIES stacked with rubber bands. 
CUT: 
COURTYARD. Volleyball game in progress. ERICH is tall and plays with dexterous grace. BILLY is fast, agile. BELL is muscular, intense, his hits power-packed. 
BILLY'S VOICE (continuous) ... In the daytimes we sometimes play volleyball against the big Turkish gangsters... 
THE THREE they play against are hilarious looking in this context, moving like big clumsy bears, waving their arms and screaming at each other, disorganized. Ever conscious of fashion, they have their jackets and vests off but play in their Elvis Presley shirts rolled up at the sleeves, shiny slacks, black pointed pumps. The boys wear shorts and sneakers. On the sidelines we see a group of PRISONERS laying bets and shouting encouragement. 
BILLY leaps up for a ball close to the net and as the TURKISH OPPONENT backs off, he dinks the ball in just over the net; the Turk SCREAMS his teammates scream at him. 
CUT: 
BELL goes up for another ball close to the net and really SMASHES it with all his might, and: 
BALL bangs right into the eye of a TURK who flails his arms and SCREAMS with pain, very theatrical. 
CUT: 
THE SAME TURK now swaggers around the COURTYARD, wearing sunglasses so no one will see his black eye. 
BILLY'S VOICE ...To the Turks all foreigners are "ayip" - unclean, dirty. We don't shave our under-arms or around our crotch... 
BELL across the pointyard grins at him and points him out to BILLY, and ERICH. 
BILLY VOICE (continuous) Even the yoga I sometimes do is "ayip" - too suggestive... 
THE TURK scowls back at BELL, huddles menacingly with another TURK. 
BILLY'S VOICE (continuous) And you're never supposed to eat with your left hand. You know why? Because that's what they use to wipe their asses with instead of toilet paper.  And yet they hate pigs. There are no pigs in Turkey. They're considered dirty... 
BELL, smirking at the Turk, turns and walks away. 
BILLY VOICE (continuous) So is homosexuality. That's a big crime here but most of them do it every chance they get.  There are about a thousand things that are "ayip".  But they're really so hypocritical, like children breaking the rules. For instance... 
Suddenly a CRY OFF and: 
THE TURK runs up, pulling a sharp SHIV from his pants, and using the cloth as a handle he repeatedly STABS BELL in the ass and backs of his thighs. One, two, three, four, five QUICK STABS, like a cook hammering veal. In spite of its violence, the action seems like slapstick. 
BELL tumbles to the ground, crying out. 
THE TURK stashes the shiv and disappears among his FRIENDS, his honor restored. 
BILLY and ERICH run over to help BELL who is obviously more in pain than in danger. 
BILLY VOICE (continuous) ...You can stab or shoot some body the but not above the waist because that's intent to kill. So everybody runs around stabbing everyone else in the ass.  That's what they call 'Turkish revenge'.  There's also a lot of "Baksheesh" that's a favorite Turkish word for bribery... 
LONG SHOT - HAMIDOU and ASLAN the young fat Turkish gangster pointed out previously by Erich, are taking tea together in the FIRST STORY KOGUS alone except for ZIATR and Hamidou's two FAT SONS, 7 and 8 years old, both dressed in little suits listening politely as Hamidou gestures to them, in couched terms. The voices are distant and, after a few beats, UNDER BILLY'S VOICE: 
HAMIDOU Unfortunately my youngest son Arief is having problems with his teeth; he needs braces, but dentists are so expensive these days 
ASLAN (patting Arief on the head) Poor kid... You know I have a friend, a very good friend; he's a dentist; maybe he could get you some braces at a... reasonable price. 
HAMIDOU (protesting with his hands, shaking his head)) Oh, no...it's out of the question...wouldn't want to ask your friend... 
ASLAN Yes. Please! As a favour... I insist 
They go on, each protesting. 
BILLY VOICE (continuous) Hamidou hints that he needs new braces for one of his sons.  Aslan of course has a friend who's a dentist.  They bullshit for half an hour and Hamidou finally accepts the "Baksheesh" in return... 
A BURLAP BAG comes flying over the WALL of the COURTYARD late at NIGHT. Then another comes over, lands in the yard. one is around. 
BILLY VOICE (continuous) Dope and all kinds of shipments get delivered to Aslan, who re- sells it through his runners. People like Ziat.  But one night, it backfired... 
A THIRD BAG comes over, gets caught on a hooknail and rips right open. HUNDREDS of yellow PILLS spill out. 
MAX Ten dollars for this shit?  You greedy one-eyed git. 
ZIAT NO!   Is good! (gets his English wrong) Me good shit. (Meaning my shit is good) 
MAX No!  You big shit! 
ZIAT thinking MAX is correcting his English, nods and repeats: 
ZIAT Yeah! Efe big shit. 
BILLY and MAX snigger and ZIAT realizes they are making fun of him.  He hates that and suddenly reaches over and: 
ZIAT JAAAASH! 
SHAKES THE CAT hard off his bunk. A SQUEAL from the cat. 
MAX surprised, glares at Ziat. 
MAX You asshole! 
Then hurries after it, calling its name... 
MAX Hikmet come here boy.  Hikmet 
ZIAT shrugs. So what? 
BILLY (irritated) What is it with you man, what the hell is it? 
ZIAT Cat, ah!  Ayip! 
BILLY You're ayip! 
ZIAT (glares at him, then lets it go) Look, you don't fuck with me, I don't fuck with you, right? 
BILLY But you fuck with me. You fuck with me all the time. You make crummy tea.  You rip us off on the hash. 
ZIAT (amused) I make special tea for you, Hiyes, okay?  We've to live like brothers. We have to be in here together. 
BILLY (tired of it) Oh shove it, Ziat for all the money you have, you have nothing! 
ZIAT grins, shrugs, squats and fiddles with his keys and footlocker. 
ZIAT You 'Merican.  You don't know. 
BILLY watches, repulsed and fascinated. 
BILLY Know what? 
ZIAT Was.. (makes gesture with his fingers) ...seven years old. I was on street in Suk.  Buy.  Sell.  No family to take care. I learn. 
BILLY Learn what? 
ZIAT shrugs. He thinks BILLY is an idiot. 
ZIAT Dog eat dog, Hi-yes. You fuck other man before he fuck you. (grins) And you must fuck last. 
BILLY That's a great philosophy. 
ZIAT (shakes his head) You 'Merican.  You don't know. 
MAX has followed his cat down to the end of the floor but it has run up into a rafter which he cannot reach. He calls up. 
MAX Here Hikmet!  Come down here boy! Hikmet... 
RAFTER Nothing. 
Max gives up. 
MAX Sodding cat! 
He shuffles off back to his bunk. 
THE CAT is back on ZIAT'S BUNK - NIGHT scratching with his paw around the radio. of the neck, hard. Suddenly he is GRABBED by the scruff  of the neck, hard. 
CUT: 
BILLY jerks up from his bunk as he the hears a loud, piercing SCREECH, OFF, echoing through the Kogus.  Then silence. 
CUT: 
ZIAT, industrious as always, is preparing his tea on the three burners of the small bottled gas' stove in THE KITCHEN, FIRST FLOOR Kogus; needless to say the area is filthy with scraps all over the floor, cats and two large wooden eating tables occupied by some PRISONERS. The Kitchen opens up in background into a WASHING ROOM with SINK. It is EARLY MORNING - Muslim CHANTING OFF, 
THREE TURKISH PRISONERS walk in, talking (AD LIB), followed by MAX stoned, who shuffles over to the table, about to sit, sees something. 
HIS CAT, dead stabbed, and lying there neglected in the corner, just another scrap ready to be swept out. 
ZIAT calmly pours the tea for the table, paying MAX no attention, an excellent actor. Prominently seated, however, is a GUARD. 
MAX I don' t know. It's someplace down in there.... (points at the ground) ..deep.. A big door...a wheel.... 
His eyes go back in time, haunted, vague breaks off. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
BELL (low-keyed) Hey, you know what's gonna get us out of here?  It's not a map, Max. It's our balls. You know what I mean... (straight at Max, Billy, very sincere, his eyes almost watering) ...I gotta get laid man, I don't know 'bout you guys, but if I don't get it on soon, I'm... I'm not gonna make it. 
MAX (under his breath) Shit. 
BELL Billy? 
BILLY ...The roof sounds better to me than digging through a wall.  Ziat's round there all the time. But the roof.... (looks up) 
P.O.V. - THE ROOF, its edges visible over the courtyard. 
BILLY shakes his head. 
BILLY The bullet percentage is awful high. 
A pause. BILLY looks away from BELL'S stare. 
BILLY If I get caught, Jimmy, I'm facing another months. I'd be back up to 3 years, maybe more... 
Looks down. 
BELL understands, deeply disappointed. 
BELL Well fuck it!  Choose your own death, babe, I'm taking the roof out of here! 
Bell leaves: 
CUT: 
A LONG DUNGEON CORRIDOR at the end of it, the frame of a small; DOOR, cracks of light at its edges. TRACK IN - F.X. of a siren, capture and now BEATING - heavy beating from behind that door.  CLOSER we reach it. The door FLIES OPEN and HAMIDOU is glimpsed lighting a cigarette. Like a surreal dream, his hand holding the match has a thick LEATHER THONG bound around its knuckles and blood speckled on his fingers. 
A BLUR of foreground movement a GUARD coming out the door - dragging: 
BELL by the hair across the floor. His face contorting in agony. 
BILLY'S VOICE Dear Susan. Poor Jimmy was caught and beaten so badly he got a severe hernia and lost a testicle. He's been in the hospital for months having operations.. 
CUT: 
CLOSE BILLY'S TOOTH BEING PULLED 
BILLY VOICE (continuous) ...In comparison my problems seem very small. But two and a half years have now gone by, and in their own fashion, the Turks are slowly draining my life away... 
WIDEN to a STONE CHAMBER and a crazy looking DENTIST in a filthy long white smock, puffing on a cigarette holder, his ashes falling over Billy as he works his mouth. A motorized drill is plugged into the wall, adjacent a filthy spittoon covered with blood; dried blood is spattered liberally around the chamber. 
BILLY spits out the blood and looks in the mirror. 
BILLY'S VOICE ...I have problems with my stomach and my leg muscles feel very weak. My gums seem to be shrinking and they sometimes bleed when I massage them... They've pulled five of my teeth... 
Suddenly he starts SHOUTING angrily in TURKISH. The DENTIST screams back at him. AD LIB. 
THE DENTIST still screaming, leans BILLY back in the chair and looks in his mouth. 
BILLY'S VOICE (continuous) ...sometimes they null the wrong one... 
CUT: 
BILLY is washing himself in his undershorts at the SINK with ERICH; the hot water is on full blast and billows of vapor fill the small stone room, like a sauna. He pours a pitcher full of hot water over his head; his eyes lingering on: 
THE STONES of the wall with their cracked moldings; some areas are noticeably darker than others - Bell's "wet spots", the alternate escape route. 
BILLY VOICE (continuos) ...even my dreams don't seem to work any more. Because the outside doesn't seem real any more. It's not even a fantasy...because there is no fantasy. 
ERICH uses a coarse washing sponge on BILLY's back. 
BILLY'S VOICE (continuous) Even masturbation has become boring. It teaches you, like the rest of prison life, to seal up your emotions, and this is the greatest danger, this is what makes so many of the men change into something monstrous... 
EYES of the ARABS peer through the musky vapors at Billy and Erich; they loll about the door curious, lecherous for their bodies. 
CUT: 
ERICH massaging BILLY on his bunk in the SECOND STORY KOGUS. 
BILLY VOICE (continuous) It is Erich who has taught me how it is to be conscious, to channel and direct my energy.  He has convinced me to stop smoking hashish, he is the calmest man I have ever known.  If you don't control your energy in here if can blow you apart like with Bell. And you can't waste it either.  You have to weigh up every one of your actions - for and against.  Too little sex, too much sex either will throw you off balance... 
ERICH leans forward and kisses a tentative BILLY on the lips.  A gentle kiss. They are standing inside the TOILET STALL; lower themselves down onto the seat. ERICH looks back over his shoulder, guarding their privacy. It is late NIGHT. 
BILLY VOICE (continuously) ...he has taught me about feelings, and the need to express them.  And he has taught me about love... 
BILLY closes his eyes, softly - and with hesitation - returns ERICH's caress. Their hands probe each other's bodies. 
BILLY VOICE (continuous) ...and what love really is, beyond its physical forms.. .I think up to now I have only considered my own self, never really another... 
Suddenly he is GRABBED by his ivy-league striped tie and his face is yanked up to the bars, his glasses falling off. 
BILLY is berserk, his face right up against the bars, GRIPPING Davis tight. 
BILLY What do you mean LIFE FOR FOR WHAT! FOR WHAT! 
DAVIS (choking) Billy!  Please! 
Commotion OFF as GUARDS run in, HAMIDOU in the lead. 
BILLY FOR WHAT!  FOR WHAT! 
The GUARDS try to pry loose BILLY'S strangling grip ON DAVIS' tie. 
BILLY I HAVE FIFTY THREE DAYS LEFT! 
HAMIDOU takes out a KNIFE and cuts the consul's tie in half.  DAVIS falls backwards. 
BILLY is hauled now. back, still gripping half the tie. He is trembling now. 
BILLY I HAVE FIFTY THREE DAYS LEFT! 
DAVIS is shaken. He has red bar marks across his face and is absent-mindedly trying to adjust half a tie as he looks at: 
BILLY being hauled out by HAMIDOU, SCREAMING something indistinct. 
CUT: 
COURTROOM. Same as before. 
BILLY, in the prisoner's dock, addresses the Court; as he speaks, a Turkish TRANSLATOR. drones underneath his voice level: 
BILLY ...What is the crime?  And what is the punishment?  The answer seems to vary from place to place, and from time to time. What's legal today is suddenly illegal tomorrow cause some society says it's so; and what's illegal yesterday all of a sudden gets legal today because everybody's doing it and you can't throw everybody in jail. Well I'm not saying this is right or wrong. It's just the way things are.... 
YESIL the lawyer; DAVIS the consul. 
THE PRESS GIRL from the previous trial in the short skirt. 
BILLY 
BILLY (continuous) But I spent the last three and a half years of my life in your prison and I think I paid for my error and if it's your decision today to sentence me to more years, I... I... (a break) You know my lawyers told me 'be cool Billy don't get upset, don't get angry, if you're good I can maybe get a pardon, an amnesty, an appeal, this that and the other thing.' Well that's been going down now for 35 years... 
YESIL looks over, surprised he is talking like this. Looks at DAVIS. 
BILLY. 
BILLY (continuous) And I've been playing it cool and I've been good and now I'm damn tired of being good cause you people gave me the belief that I had 53 days left.  You hung 53 days in front of my eyes and then you took those 53 days away, and Mister Prosecutor!  I just wish you could... 
PROSECUTOR looks over, through his dark green glasses. 
BILLY (OVER) ... stand right here where I'm standing and feel what that... ...feels like, cause then you'd know something you don't know you'd know what means, Mister Prosecutor and you'd know the concept of a society is based on the quality of its mercy means, of its sense of fair play, its sense of justice... but (shrugs and scoffs at himself) I guess that's just like asking a bear to shit in a toilet... 
TRANSLATOR stops, looks puzzled. 
BILLY 
BILLY (same self-mocking tone) For a nation of pigs, it's funny you don't eat them.  Fuck it, give me the sentence. Jesus forgave the bastards, but I can't. I hate you. Nation. I hate your I hate your people. And I fuck your sons and daughters! 
Sits down, disgusted; under his breath: 
BILLY ...cause you're all pigs. 
SILENCE in the uncomfortably. courtroom.  PEOPLE looking at each other DAVIS looks down. 
YESIL flips some pages abstractedly. 
TRANSLATOR SCARED: 
TRANSLATOR Would Your honor like me to translate? 
THE OLD CHIEF JUDGE, the same one as before Shakes his head. 
JUDGE That won't be necessary 
ANOTHER ANGLE - THE JUDGE turns to BILLY in the foreground rises, and unexpectedly crosses his wrists out in front of him. 
JUDGE (emotionally) My hands are tied by Ankara! 
Makes the gesture of the hands forcefully, with anger. 
TRANSLATOR (OFF) My hands are tied by Ankara! 
BILLY WATCHING, 
JUDGE (OFF) I must sentence you, Vilyum Hiyes... 
JUDGE 
ANOTHER ANGLE - all THREE press their ears to the stone. A silence. The faintest whisper of WIND and dripping 'WATER - indicating a shaft of some nature. BELL looks back at BILLY. 
BELL I told you, I told you you cock- suckers!  You didn't believe me. 
BILLY smiles. MAX reaches over and grabs Bell's face between his hands, kisses him violently. 
MAX Fuck me! You beautiful mother, you! 
CUT: 
MAX now on guard at the STAIRS, looks over at: 
BELL AND BILLY - with fresh paste putting the finishing touches on the edges of the stone which has been replaced in its original position. Bell's half naked torso reveals a pair of dice with lucky sevens tattooed on his shoulder. 
CUT: 
THE REPLACED STONE. On close inspection, it is apparent that the stucco around it doesn't match the other stones one bit, but as we PULL BACK to see ZIAT washing his tea cups in the SINK during the DAY, this irregularity is lost in the greater mosaic of the wall structure. At least ZIAT doesn't notice as: 
BILLY nervously comes into the SINK area, watching him, and calls to him. 
BILLY (using Turkish) Hey, Ziat, hurry up with the tea will ay! 
ZIAT (mutters to himself) Work, work, work, that's all do 
BILLY I don't hear you bitch about the money. 
BILLY followed by ZIAT into the KITCHEN casts a look of relief at: 
BELL and MAX who wait at a table with empty tea cups. 
CUT: 
A HORDE OF COCKROACHES stream out from a crack in the stone as BILLY and MAX dig, scrape, jiggle the third stone. Both covered with sweat, working with confidence now. 
A DARK EMPTY SHAFT on the other side. Dripping water.  Two stones removed. 
BELL runs over: 
BELL Want me to take over? 
BILLY You want to split your hernia again? 
MAX Get off our tits! 
Bell turns to go. Suddenly a LOUD CRUMBLING NOISE and: 
A FOURTH STONE starts to go - but brakes itself. 
BILLY, MAX, BELL all framed in a posture of fear -- not daring to move. 
SECOND STORY KOGUS remains silent. 
BELL looks up the STAIRS, tiptoes back, indicating they are clear. 
MAX AND BILLY. All THREE of them look: 
THE THREE A HALF STONE SPACE. Easily big enough for them to squeeze through. BILLY shines a candle in the shaft, OFF. 
THE THREE look at each other. The same thought. Eager eyes. The TRAIN WHISTLES by in the night, OFF. 
BELL (sudden) Let's go! 
BILLY looks at his watch, hates to do it. Shakes his head. 
BILLY No. No time. Put 'em back. 
MAX groans to himself. 
CUT: 
BILLY tense and restless at his BUNK TWILIGHT. A loud RADIO OFF - Turkish News. 
BILLY We go early. Any fuck-ups we should be back here and have the stones in by dawn. 
ANOTHER ANGLE - MAX, BELL, AND BILLY. A pause. 
BILLY You got your stuff? 
MAX Yeah. 
BELL (persistent) Haps, railroad, bus timetables? 
MAX (business-like) Everything. 
BILLY Okay. (looks around the group) Let's do it. 
He extends his hands and the other two cross in a six-handed shake. 
MAX I want to cut his throat. 
BILLY It's already been cut. 
MAX Then I'll cut his balls off. 
BILLY smiles, shakes his head, then: 
BILLY If you really wanted to hurt Ziat (pause) 
MAX slumps back down on the bunk, suddenly tired of killing. 
BILLY (reflective) ...His money - steal that, you steal his blood... Could you see his face when everything he worked so hard to get got snatched? (plays with the thought idly, then shrugs) If we knew where he hid it. (waves it away) Anyway, steal from him they'd pick up the whole prison and shake it sideways.  We couldn't hide it anywhere. 
MAX (head bobbing now, murmurs) You know where it is? 
BILLY What? 
MAX (a vague grin) I know where it is. 
BILLY glances at him, not sure whether he heard. 
BILLY His money? 
MAX gives him a goofy nod - and a grin. Imitating Robert Newton as Long John Silver. 
MAX 'Dem dat hides can finds says I'... I seen him, the clever tit, sneaking looks at it late at night, talking to it. 
BILLY (beginning to believe him) Yeah? Where? 
MAX, distracted, let's his attention wander back.  Inaudible his head bobbing now. 
MAX Hishradyo. 
BILLY Max - where? 
MAX (his mouth hanging open, eyes closed) His radio Back of his open, radio... 
He lurches over gently on the bunk. 
MAX That's why he never plays it... 
MAX Sleeps. 
BILLY surprised, then reflective. 
CUT: 
THE BACK OF THE RADIO is unscrewed; the cover pulled off. EMPTY! 
MOVE TO ZIAT.  The look is as Billy expected. Horror, shock, anger, fear.  ZIAT SCREAMS hysterically like old Greek widow and: 
BEATING HIS CHEST and tearing at his hair, ZIAT runs out of the KOGUS wailing, moaning. 
CUT: 
THE SECOND STORY KOGUS is being" controlled" by the GUARDS. WIDE ANGLE reveals a circus of clockwork destruction as the GUARDS, making abundant NOISE, systematically rip up each bunk, locker, mattress, picture, book, etc., their faces flushed with this opportunity for orgy. 
CUT: 
THE PRISONERS are lined up in the COURTYARD, each one being body searched.Prominent are MAX and BILLY, looking up amused at the 
SECOND STORY WINDOWS - feathers from a mattress fly around. ZIAT Briefly appears, his face at the window, looking at the prisoners in the yard, frustrated. 
HAMIDOU breaks apart a with his bare hands. 
ZIAT is stripping MAX's possessions, sure he will find it here. 
VOICE (OFF) Down here! 
Ziat springs up. 
GUARD calling out from the STAIRS. 
GUARD We found it! 
CUT: 
ZIAT leaning in CLOSE, OVER THE STOVE in the KITCHEN, framed by GUARDS. It is the same crouched posture he always uses to work the stove but now his eyes show complete despair as he sees: 
A THOUSAND SHREDS OF PAPER MONEY floating in his pots amid his withered tea bags. From ashes to ashes and dust to dust. 
ZIAT folds his head into his hands, sobbing then wailing very human, very sad. 
CUT: 
KITCHEN - NEGDIR an Arab, is now running the tea concession. A jolly ebullient man. Pours a cup for MAX. Several OTHERS are at the table. 
HAMIDOU (turns on Billy, in English) You, goddamn you, shut up! (Back to MAX) Take him to the cellar) 
GUARDS drag off. 
MAX Get out of here! He's lying!  That cock-sucker!  Billy...? 
CUT: 
BILLY sits on his his anger building, his imagination running wild. 
CUT: 
MAX being dragged down a CORRIDOR by his feet. A SCREAM. 
BILLY 
CUT: 
BELL, his features distorted, being carried into an AMBULANCE. 
CUT: 
BELL, MAX and BILLY at the wall, digging together, MAX hugging BELL the time they found the shaft. 
CUT: 
MAX twisting out of the grip of a GUARD and, grabbing the glass from his smashed spectacles, he cuts deep into his wrist.  GUARDS grab him. A LOUD LAUGH OFF carrying over. 
BILLY turning on his bunk to see: 
ZIAT joking with TWO GUARDS as he enters the SECOND STORY. The guards back down the stairs. 
BILLY already in movement. 
ZIAT, in his suit, collecting suitcase from his bunk, preparing to leave. 
VOICE (OFF) ZIAT! 
Turns and catches a FIST in the side of the face.  Staggers into a bunk. 
BILLY, fists clenched, yells a string of Turkish curse words at him: 
BILLY Asina covacim, ipnave pesankek...yosakt. 
Lunges. 
ZIAT is bulky, throws the smaller BILLY off and scrambles past a bunk. 
BILLY is up and after him. Jumps back as a SHIV cuts the air in front of him. His side is cut. 
ZIAT holding the shiv, feints, cursing BILLY in Turkish. 
BILLY skips back, takes a MATTRESS off the bed and runs it right into KNOCKING HIM AND THE WHOLE BUNK OVER. 
THE TWO scramble around, BILLY tackling him into another BUNK which also goes over. Chairs break. 
ZIAT butts his head into BILLY'S jaw. 
BILLY staggers back from the blow and ZIAT jumps him, BITING into his ear. 
ZIAT, getting a better hold, now BITES into BILLY'S NOSE. 
BILLY slams ZIAT in the nose hard with the palm of his hand.  ZIAT relinquishes his hold, grabbing at his broken bleeding nose. 
BILLY beats him around the head but though the blood now flows and teeth are broken, is like a clumsy bear, hard to kill. 
ZIAT scrambles away on his knees under another BUNK now screaming as loud as he can. 
ZIAT HELP ME!  GUARDS!  HELP ME! 
SEVERAL PRISONERS watching from further down the SECOND STORY Kogus now move in sync, turning on their RADIOS loud as possible, drowning out the cries for help, others watching the stairs. 
BILLY takes the BUNK and throws it over, revealing ZIAT cowering in pure terror. He grabs ZIAT by the hair, hauls him up and 
LAUNCHES HIS KNEE into HIS FACE. 
ZIAT thuds onto the floor. 
BILLY stomps him in the gut hard. 
ZIAT screams unnaturally shrill. 
BILLY, driven by supernatural anger, now jumps on him and CLAMPS HIS MOUTH right on ZIAT'S open SCREAM. 
A STRUGGLING KISS ensues. 
BILLY pulls back, his mouth filled with blood, spitting out. 
SUSAN is worked up to the limit, tries to hug him through the window. 
SUSAN Oh Billy... Billy!  Don't give up. Please don't give up. You'll get out. I know you will! 
Remembers something. Grabs the PHOTO ALBUM with all her strength, holding it up for him to see through the glass.Then remembering herself, looks around the room to make sure they're alone and in a contained voice: 
SUSAN Billy, your father gave me this for you.  There's pictures of your Mom and Dad...Rob...Peg... 
BILLY looks at it listlessly. 
HIS P.V.O - SUSAN holding the album open to PICTURES of his MOTHER and FATHER in front of the house, ROB on a bicycle, PEG in her cheer-leading outfit. 
SUSAN And there's pictures in the back of your old Mr. Franklin.  Remember him... From the bank? 
A certain tone slips into her voice. 
SUSAN He's over in Greece now. He bought a ticket. 
BILLY looks from the album to Susan. Possibly there is a gleam of understanding in his eyes but it is very faint. An Attendant BANGS on Susan's door, OFF. 
VOICE Visiting is over. 
SUSAN quickly puts the album away as if it were a hidden weapon. 
SUSAN I'll give it to them for you. 
She buttons her blouse but her eyes are worried, on Billy. 
SUSAN You were right Billy don't count on them, you hear, don't count on anybody but yourself! 
The ATTENDANT now swings open her door, annoyed. 
ATTENDANT Let's go! 
Susan stands, about to go, then suddenly leans up close to the bars, hard and practical. 
SUSAN (quickly) If you stay you'll die Billy!  Get out of here. Get to Greece, you hear me?...Billy? 
Pause. Silence. She closes her eyes, in pain; she doesn't think she has reached him. She turns to go, resigned. 
BILLY looking at her. Behind him HAMIDOU opens the door. A calm and cunning look on his face, glancing with Billy towards 
A BRIEF GLIMPSE of SUSAN looking back, the album under her arm. The door closes. 
CUT: 
BILLY, with the same deadened expression as before, comes down the STAIRS towards THE WHEEL. It is early morning and the walkers haven't started yet. Billy looks at the Pillar a dire look of reflection passing over his eyes. Then he starts walking but in a clockwise motion, opposite the normal pattern; in the same methodical manner as before. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
BILLY, on the inner track, passes TWO LUNATICS who are walking counter-clockwise. They glare at him, motion for him to turn around. Billy just keeps walking. 
BILLY intersects several more LUNATICS going counter- clockwise They motion for him to turn. 
LUNATIC (grunting) Gower! 
Tries to block Billy's way, but BILLY shakes his head, brushes by him - determined. 
AHMET Slides up next to BILLY in his rags. 
AHMET Good morning, my American friend! There will be trouble if you go this way. A good Turk always walks to the right. Left is communist. Right is good. You must go the other way... It's Good. 
More LUNATICS join the flow, gesturing or grunting at BILLY. 
BILLY STOPS, turns, looks at the rest of them slogging in the usual direction, looks as if he 'sees' them; and he walks out of the wheel, towards the stairs. 
AHMET curious about his unusual behavior, follows BILLY. 
AHMET Why you go?  Why don't you walk the wheel with us? (suspiciously leaning forward, suddenly realizing the answer) The bad machine doesn't know he's a bad machine. You still don't believe it? You still don't believe you're a bad machine? 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
BILLY stops and turns to look at AHMET at the base of the STAIRS. BILLY carries on up the stairs. 
AHMET (shakes his head) To know oneself is to know God, my friend. The factory knows.  That's why they put you here. You'll see. You'll find out. Later on you'll know. 
BILLY stops and turns to look at AHMET.  His eyes glint with special knowledge and he takes AHMET into his confidence using the latter's tone of voice: 
BILLY I already know. I know that you're a bad machine.  That's why the factory keeps you here. (Lowers s voice) You know how I know?  I know because I'm from the factory. I make the machines.. I'm here to spy on you. 
Eyes narrow. Surprise. Fear. He shuffles away. 
BILLY looks at him and turns up the STAIRS. 
CUT: 
BILLY in his BED. The usual UPROAR. THE ATTENDANT comes by with the pills, offers a handful to BILLY. 
BILLY naked, totally passive, semiconscious. HAMIDOU suddenly shifts position and snaps Billy into a strenuous wrestling hold across his knee on the steamy floor. He loosens him up by cracking his bones along his back. 
HAMIDOU - sweat pouring off his face, excited. 
HAMIDOU ...And I fuck your grandmother and I fuck your pretty girlfriend... And I fuck you Hi-yes!) 
A bizarre otherworldly scene. This man is dredging Billy through a sadistic imagination sparked by the steam, the sweat, and an ethnic identification with a Turkish steam bath as a bedroom. He loosens his hold abruptly, rises, moves off as: 
BILLY holds himself on his knees, head sunk on his chest, gasping for breath, about to vomit. Pause; he looks up horrified at: 
HAMIDOU pouring fresh buckets of water on the floor. SSSSSSSSSS!  The awakened STEAM coils like a snake into every cranny of the little room. 
BLURRED VISUALS - HAMIDOU stripping his shirt off. A huge muscular flash of chest, 
A BELT being snapped open. 
BILLY waiting. 
A FIGURE moving through the steam, closer. 
BILLY backing away from it. 
STEAM - a glint of a FACE coming through.  HAMIDOU - his eyes so intense they seem to burn off the steam like sun cutting haze. Then disappear again. 
BILLY pulls back. A pause. Silence. Cat and mouse.  Then very suddenly: 
A HAND reaches out of the STEAM and GRABS BILLY by the hair.  A GRUNT, OFF. 
BILLY his eyes moving fast. 
A FLASH of a huge darkened penis, fully erect cutting forward into the steam like a from drill, detached from the rest of the body. 
A SOUND - grotesque and so sudden after the silence it jars the senses. A BLURRED VISUAL then: 
BILLY Launching forward in SLOW MOTION, desperation distorting his features and: 
STEAM - then BILLY'S HEAD SLAMS through it in SLOW MOTION and: 
SMASHES the penis with its skull. A horrifying GASP. 
BLURRED VISUALS - STEAM - HAMIDOU staggering CLOSE - surprise, pain... 
BILLY MOVING. 
A FOOT coming up fast through the steam, connecting again with the genitals. Another SCREAM. 
A BODY hitting the tiles. 
BILLY groping for the falaka stick. Raises it. 
A STRUGGLE - Two bodies thrashing, one of them screaming now in pain. A definitive sound then a THWACK! Another thwack!  The steam seems to clear and 
BILLY is on top of the gigantic HAMIDOU smashing him with the falaka stick with all his might. 
HAMIDOU is in contortions, his nose busted and bleeding. 
His HAND gripping BILLY by the neck, forcing him back and strangling him at the same time. Billy is red in the face, such is the force of this creature but continues to beat him, harder, harder.  His expression filled with a life energy, seeded in hatred, that he thought he had lost. Again, Again - 
BILLY Babba sikijam, Hamidu!  I fuck your Mother, I fuck your daughter, I fuck your sons, I fuck your wife! 
The BAND slips from his throat, then springs up desperately again and clenches Billy's whole face with one gigantic palm, clawing to get in, then just as quickly slips away. BILLY beats on - again, again. 
BLOOD flows fast in agitated swirls into the little pool. 
CUT: 
BILLY opens a door gently, moves across an empty CORRIDOR, dressed in and gun in intense. Hamidou's holster. large uniform with his He looks shaken, weak, falaka stick dizzy but 
VOICE (OFF) How about a shoe shine, friend? 
BILLY starts, clenches the falaka stick ready to spring, spins. 
A LITTLE SHOESHINE BOY is his case down the corridor. 
BILLY has not seen a child in a long time. get words out, then manages: Surprised.  Can't get the words out, then manages: 
BILLY No! 
THE KID shrugs, moves on, looking At Billy strangely. 
BILLY goes up a flight of STAIRS.  Ahead, VOICES passing. He stops. Goes on. 
BILLY goes through an empty GUARD QUARTERS. 
BILLY is in another CORRIDOR, approaches 
A SMALL PORTAL, daylight at its edges.  Locked? 
BILLY Those mountains? are they? 
DRIVER (Greece (shakes his head) Very bad now. Maybe war. Those Greek pigs try to steal Cyprus again (pause)) How'd you lose your friends? 
BILLY leaning back in his seat, casual. 
BILLY Oh, I drank a lot of raka last night in Istanbul. Got into a fight. 
Indicates the bruises on his face. 
DRIVER looking at him in the rear view mirror. His curiosity narrowing. 
DRIVER How come you speak Turkish so good? 
BILLY casually glances out the window. 
BILLY Did twenty months in prison in Istanbul.  Hash 
THE DRIVER studies BILLY in the rear-view mirror. Then: 
DRIVER You want to score some?  Cheap? 
BILLY looks at him hard. Something's wrong with this man. 
BILLY (curt) No! 
Cutting off further conversation, he looks out at: 
THE MOUNTAINS of Greece - with longing. 
BILLY stares back at: 
THE DRIVER whose eyes now move away from the rear-view mirror under the pressure of the stare.  SOUND OFF loud machinery. 
BILLY turning - in rear window, we see a TURKISH HALFTRACK pulling alongside the cab, SOLDIERS waving their arms for the cabdriver to get out of the way. 
ANOTHER ANGLE - the HALFTRACK pulls level. The CABDRIVER slows down, with a curse. 
BILLY - beads of sweat trickle his brow 
THE PERSONNEL CARRIER, disinterested, pulls past. 
BILLY breathes heavily with nervous relief. 
CUT: 
THE CAB pulls up to the end of a dirt road. 
BILLY has his MAP out, studying it. 
BILLY The Maritas River? Where is it? 
ANOTHER ANGLE - the DRIVER, exasperated, waves southwest. 
DRIVER Two miles! Minefields over there. Do you know where this campground is or not? 
BILLY Not far. Just a little way. 
DRIVER No!  I'm not going any further! It'll wreck my car. 
BILLY I'll pay extra 
DRIVER How much? 
ANOTHER ANGLE - BILLY slips him fifty lira. The DRIVER takes it, muttering under his breath, jams the cab into gear. 
THE CAB follows rutted tracks into low HILLS. 
INTERIOR CAB - very bumpy. 
BILLY Where are the minefields? 
DRIVER All over.  Turkish Army up there. It's against the law. They shoot us. (looks up in the mirror) You sure you looking for your friends, man? 
BILLY(VERY SHARP NOW) (very sharp now) Okay!  Ley me out right here.  I'm getting tired of all this bullshit from you.  I'll walk it. 
DRIVER (looks back, then ahead, suddenly brightening) Ah, look!  they probably know where the campers are 
BILLY's entire expression changes. It is all over. 
A TANK AND HALFTRACK are sitting there by the rutted track, with SOLDIERS. And a little LEAN-TO with several POLICE. Also a couple of attack DOGS on leashes. The Driver honks his horn on the approach. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
DRIVER Hey officer, we're looking for the campground. Do you know where it is? 
ANOTHER ANGLE - TWO POLICEMEN and A SOLDIER come sauntering over, their collars open, beer bottles in hand, slightly drunk. 
THE TANK starts to roll after it. Full speed. The HALFTRACK follows, the MEN riding it shouting. 
BILLY looks back, then looking ahead sees something. 
P.O.V - a speck in the far distance. Another ROADBLOCK. 
BILLY decides, then - 
THE CAB swerves right off the road and jumps into the gently rolling FIELD on the border of the road, pock marked with HILLS. 
THE TURKS come roaring down the road, pointing to the cab. 
LOW ANGLE - the TANK makes a flat out stop, gears grinding. 
THE GUN TURRET swings left. 
THE CAB in the far distance, at an angle to the tank, starts running up an incline. 
THE TANK FIRES. 
P.O.V. - SHELL BLASTS WIDE OF THE CAB. 
BILLY, startled, looks back, guns for the top of the incline. 
HIS P.O.V. - ANOTHER SHELL now blasts to his front right, closer. Something heavy (shrapnel) thuds into the rood of the cab. 
BILLY drives all out. 
P.O.V. - THE INCLINE CLOSER, CLOSER, ABOUT TO MAKE IT, THEN: A BLAST 
TANK P.O.V. - the CAB spinning in the blast of the adjacent shell-burst. 
BILLY, shaken but unhurt, staggers out of the cab, looks: 
P.O.V. - A WHEEL BLASTED AWAY, FUEL PISSING OUT FROM THE SHRAPNEL HOLES, SMASHED WINDSHIELD AND FENDER. 
THE TURKS are coming up the incline now, like the Cavalry -- some on foot running, others on the HALFTRACK.  BULLETS whistle and pop nearby. 
BILLY running. He tears off his jacket. 
SOLDIERS pass the wrecked car, at the top of the incline shouting, pointing and firing at 
BILLY in the distance. 
ONE SOLDIER seems lighter than the others and takes off in a sprint as the OTHERS follow. 
THE HALFTRACK now crests the incline and gathering full gear and momentum, roars off down the slope after Billy. 
CLOSE BILLY running sweat all over him. In background, the HALFTRACK and running FIGURES. 
BILLY runs into a high dry cornfield with the sun starting to set ahead of him in the Greek mountains. 
MOUNTAINS - must make those mountains. 
BILLY running all out - eyes fixed on them, breathing, skipping heartbeats. 
THE PERSONNEL CARRIER bypasses the FAST SOLDIER who slows down, panting. Billy has outrun him. 
OTHER SOLDIERS run up in the distance. 
BILLY, tireless, obsessed, runs right into a POPPY FIELD.It is a splendid beautiful scarlet red, set off by the dipping rays of the sun. 
HIS FEET smashing down the poppy plants.  Fast - THUCK! THUCK!  THUCK!  THUCK!  THUCK!  THUCK! 
CROSSCUT the metal TREADS of the Halftrack into the poppy, mowing down entire rows. 
TWO SOLDIERS on the PERSONNEL CARRIER are waving encouragement to the driver inside. They have him. 
ANOTHER ANGLE the HALFTRACK closing the distance on BILLY now thirty yards apart. 
BILLY looking back, starting to fade. Huge wheezing gasps of breath. 
SOLDIERS running up looking at 
THE HALFTRACK in the distance. 
SOLDIERS yell. 
SOLDIERS Minefield!  Minefield! Come back! Stop! (NO SUBTITLE) 
BILLY runs out of the POPPY FIELD into a THIN FOREST. 
THE SOLDIERS screaming in the distance, jumping up and down waving for the halftrack to come back. 
LOW ANGLE - the HALFTRACK with the waving SOLDIERS on board now blasts out of the poppy field at full speed. 
BILLY -- he has no chance, In immediate background is the fast HALFTRACK.

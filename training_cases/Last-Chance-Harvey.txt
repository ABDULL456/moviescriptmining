LAST CHANCE HARVEY 
Written by 
Joel Hopkins 
Sound of a piano being played. Sparse but beautiful. 
FADE IN: 
INT. RECORDING ROOM - DAY 
HARVEY SHINE, mid-60's, sits at a piano in a scruffy recording room, tinkering. We hold on his slightly sad, intense gaze. Just then a shaft of crude light illuminates him, accompanied by a knocking sound. From behind a studio window, JOHNNIE, a young rocker type in his 20's beckons. Harvey closes the piano lid. 
INT. STUDIO - DAY 
Johnnie, unpacking his lunch and turning on various buttons, sits at a mixing desk. In front of him are 2 large TV monitors. Harvey joins him. 
HARVEY Put my score up first. 
JOHNNIE They don't want to hear it, Harvey. 
HARVEY I know, but I want to hear it. Put it up. 
JOHNNIE I'm backed up already, Harvey. 
HARVEY (interrupting) Johnnie, you were the one that was late. Just put it up. 
Johnnie reluctantly presses various buttons. 
A `cheesy' commercial for a washing detergent plays. It is accompanied by a jolly classical score. Harvey looks on forlornly at his work. As it comes to an end with a flourish, Harvey lowers his head. Beat. Johnnie glances at him. 
JOHNNIE Listen, Harvey. Marvin wants me to present my ideas while your away. 
Harvey looks up, confused. 
HARVEY Huh? 
JOHNNIE Look, I'm not doing myself any favours here, Harvey. But, I'd watch your back. 
We hold on Harvey's tired, pensive face. 
INT. STUDIO CAR PARK / QUEENS - DAY 
Harvey hurriedly exits the studio, catching up with a man walking to his car. 
HARVEY Marvin? Hey, Marvin? 
MARVIN Hey, Harvey. Shouldn't you be in London? 
HARVEY Yeah, I'm heading there now. What's going on? 
MARVIN Huh? 
HARVEY Johnnie said something about you wanting him to present on Monday. 
MARVIN Oh yeah, No, I was just thinking that, what with you being in London - you should stay a while. 
HARVEY What? 
MARVIN There's no need to rush back. Enjoy your daughter's wedding. 
HARVEY What? 
MARVIN Well, Johnnie can do it. I mean, he can pitch the Samuelson account. 
HARVEY No, I'm coming back. Those are my connections. They have been for years. 
MARVIN I know but... they've got new people running things over there. I think they're after something... (beat) ...different. 
Harvey nods. 
WOMAN (CONT'D) (feeling obliged) Yourself? 
HARVEY My daughter's getting married. 
WOMAN Congratulations. 
HARVEY (smiles) Thank you. (beat) She's marrying an American. But for some reason we've all got to go over to London. (smiling) I told her we had a perfectly good wedding system here. (MORE) 
HARVEY (CONT'D) (beat/expecting more of a response) They both work there, you see. 
The woman smiles again, then looks up as the Stewardess returns with Harvey's drink. 
HARVEY (CONT'D) Thank you. 
Harvey is about to continue speaking when the woman interrupts. 
WOMAN I'm really sorry but I have a meeting in the morning and I must try and get some sleep. 
HARVEY No... Of course. I'm sorry. 
WOMAN It's just, I'll be useless - unless I get some sleep. 
HARVEY Sure. 
The woman covers herself in a blanket and turns out her light, turning herself away from Harvey. 
We hold on Harvey from a distance, spotlit in a sea of darkness. 
FADE TO BLACK. 
Sound of a commercial London Radio Station. A `phone-in' competition takes place. 
FADE IN: 
EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MORNING 
A radio hangs from a mail trolley. KATE, mid 40's, dressed in a green uniform, turns into the path of a suburban house. She passes a postman - who nods his head. 
POSTMAN Morning Kate. Looking lovely as ever. If I was younger... 
KATE Careful Paddy. (pointing to her cheek) Blushing! Is she up? 
POSTMAN Oh yes. 
Kate smiles before unlocking the front door. 
INT. HALLWAY - MORNING 
Kate comes through the door, picking up a small pile of mail off the floor. 
KATE (calling out) Mum. It's me - your daughter. 
INT. KITCHEN - MORNING 
Kate puts the mail on a kitchen table. Just then MAGGIE, Kate's mum, enters in her dressing gown. 
MAGGIE Hello, my daughter. 
They kiss. 
MAGGIE (CONT'D) Have a cup of tea with me. 
KATE I can't, I'm running late. 
Maggie seems to ignore this piece of information and heads to the kettle. Filling it up, she peers out the back window. 
MAGGIE He's at it again. 
KATE Scum. 
Aggie giggles to herself and writes it in. Kate stands just as another co-worker hurries in. 
OONAGH Sorry. Sorry. 
She kisses Kate on the cheek and opens her locker. 
OONAGH (CONT'D) Thank God you're my boss. 
Without looking up, Aggie `tuts' and shakes her head. Oonagh decides to ignore. 
OONAGH (CONT'D) Are we still on for tonight? Matt's definitely bringing Simon. 
KATE No. 
OONAGH Please. 
KATE Only if you guys swear you won't leave if it's not going well. 
OONAGH No way. 
KATE Promise? 
OONAGH Promise. 
AGGIE Seven down. Another word for `souvenir'? 
Kate thinks for a beat. 
KATE Memento. 
Aggie laughs and scribbles it in. Oonagh rolls her eyes. 
OONAGH Aggie, why do you bother? You just get Kate to give you all the answers. 
Aggie `tuts' again and waves Oonagh away. Kate hands Oonagh a clip-board and the two of them head out. 
INT. BAGGAGE CAROUSEL - DAY 
As luggage spews out, a dishevelled Harvey looks on. He sees his case and awkwardly pulling it from the belt, heads off. 
INT. ARRIVALS HALL - DAY 
Oonagh and Kate stand next to each other, interviewing returning travellers. Kate interviews an elderly couple. It's clear she's good at her job. 
KATE So you spent the whole 2 weeks in the Toronto area? 
ELDERLY MAN Yes. Our daughter lives there, see. 
KATE Ah. (filling in a form) So not a business trip then? 
ELDERLY MAN Oh, no. Unless you count grand- children as work. 
KATE (smiles) Some might. 
INT. ARRIVAL DOORS 
Harvey comes through a set of sliding double doors, wheeling his case behind him. 
INT. ARRIVALS HALL - DAY 
Kate finishes up the interview with the elderly couple, and turns to see an approaching Harvey in the distance. She registers his attempts to steer a wide berth of her, but matches his movements, bringing him to a stop. 
KATE Sorry, I couldn't just ask you a few very quick questions, could I? 
HARVEY I'm sorry, but I'm in a bit of a hurry. 
KATE It won't take a moment. 
Just then, to his relief, his phone rings. He hurries over to the bed and retrieves it. 
HARVEY Hello? (beat) Suzie! Hi darling. Yes, I'm here. Where are you - where is everyone? (listens/Harvey's face drops a little) Oh...I see. No, I didn't realise. I thought the plan was for everyone to stay together. 
Noticeably dejected, Harvey sits down on the bed. 
HARVEY (CONT'D) No its...fine. I just wasn't sure. (beat) (MORE) 
HARVEY (CONT'D) So your mother has rented a house for you all. (beat) I see. No, no, don't be silly. I'm a big boy. It's fine. 
Harvey looks around the bland room. 
HARVEY (CONT'D) Home from home. (beat) Yes, I've got the address. So, I'll see you there. (beat) I love you too. Bye. 
Harvey hangs up. 
EXT. STREET - DUSK 
Kate, dressed for the evening, hurries along a street. Her phone rings. 
KATE Mum? 
INT. KITCHEN - DUSK 
Kate's mum stands not far from her back window. 
MAGGIE What are you wearing? 
EXT. STREET - DUSK 
KATE Dungarees. 
INT. KITCHEN - DUSK 
MAGGIE Oh, you're not! 
EXT. STREET - DUSK 
KATE They're completely in again, haven't you heard? 
INT. KITCHEN - DUSK 
MAGGIE (lifting back the curtain) Oh, you're just being silly. 
POV: A now bare chested Neighbour at work in his garden. Smoke rising from his shed. 
MAGGIE (CONT'D) Now don't be nervous. Just be yourself. 
EXT. STREET - DUSK 
KATE (smiling) Ok, mum. Thanks for the advice. 
INT. KITCHEN - DUSK 
MAGGIE Oh, listen. I've been thinking about Greece for our holiday. 
EXT. STREET - DUSK 
KATE (frowns) Ok, Let's talk about it later. (beat) I love you too. 
Kate hangs up and crosses a busy road. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - DUSK 
Kate's mum continues to spy. POV: The Neighbour bends down out of sight. On rising again, he sees Maggie at the window and waves. Maggie flinches, before dropping the curtain. 
INT. PUB - DUSK 
Kate comes through the door. Oonagh sits on her own at a booth. Kate joins her. 
Harvey enters the room. He sees his daughter, standing off to one side, with Scott, talking to some friends. 
She looks beautiful. He takes a moment to just watch her. As she turns in slight slow motion, she smiles on seeing her father and joins him. 
SUSAN Hi Dad. 
HARVEY Suz... (beat) You look beautiful. 
SUSAN Thank you. 
Slightly awkward pause. 
HARVEY Give us a hug then, as they say in this country. 
They embrace. Beat. Off Susan's look... 
HARVEY (CONT'D) I know, I look ridiculous. 
SUSAN No. You look... 
HARVEY Like a bad lounge act. 
Susan smiles at her Father. Beat. 
HARVEY (CONT'D) I spilt something on my trousers. (beat) I've been doing that a lot recently. 
Harvey looks over at Scott in the distance, sharing a laugh with his buddies. 
SUSAN Dad. 
HARVEY Long way to come to see two American kids get married. 
Susan looks at her father, a little irked. 
SUSAN Sorry for the inconvenience, Dad. 
Harvey looks at his daughter. 
HARVEY Sorry. 
Beat. 
SUSAN Have you seen mum yet? 
HARVEY No. They're here? 
SUSAN Yes. They're over by our table. 
Harvey looks over. 
SUSAN (CONT'D) Please Daddy. 
HARVEY What? (beat) I'll be good. 
Just then, they are approached by Scott guiding some friends over to say hello. 
SCOTT Look who i've got! 
Susan's girlfriends shriek with delight as they approach. Susan turns to greet them. 
HARVEY I'll speak to you later Suz. You enjoy your friends. 
As Susan greets her friends, Harvey retreats. 
INT. PUB - NIGHT 
Kate rejoins the others. Oonagh and Matt are standing. Matt has his jacket on. 
OONAGH (to Kate) We've gotta go. Problem at home. Baby-sitter just rang. Nothing serious. (MORE) 
MELISSA What? Men in white. Oh, I do. 
Kate looks on as the girls laugh. 
INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
Harvey sits at the end of the table, looking on, as everyone talks animatedly around him. He eats his food and drinks plenty of wine. Up near the middle Scott shares a joke with Brian. Just then Susan, who has been talking to the best man, turns and catches her father's eye. He smiles at her and raises a glass. Susan smiles back before returning her attention back to her neighbour. 
INT. PUB BOOTH - NIGHT 
Kate sits among the group. She too seems to be detached from the proceedings. 
GWEN I heard that they did it in her bedroom, while she was away. 
SIMON It was her flat? 
GWEN Yep. He has his own, but was basically living at hers. 
ANDREW Ouch. 
MELISSA That is evil. 
As the conversation continues in this vein, Kate glances at Simon. He seems more at ease in this company. 
INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
The meal is drawing to a close. People have gotten up and are circulating around the table and nearby. 
INT. BAR AREA - NIGHT 
Harvey stands at the bar. He downs a drink. Jean approaches. 
JEAN Harvey. 
HARVEY Hello Jean. 
JEAN (to barman) Can I get a glass of water please? 
The Barman obliges. 
JEAN (CONT'D) You Ok? 
HARVEY (Downing another drink) Fine. 
Beat. 
JEAN Go easy Harvey. 
HARVEY (getting quite loaded) Why, Jean? Are you worried i'm going to embarrass you again? 
JEAN No Harvey, I'm worried you're going to embarrass yourself. (beat) And more importantly Susan. This weekend's just about her and Scott. Nothing else. 
HARVEY Oh, you're good Jean. You're really good. You've always known how to make me feel shit, haven't you? (beat) You've always been so good at that. 
JEAN I've had cause to practice. 
Beat. 
HARVEY Tell me, Jean. Were you ever proud of me? 
JEAN Yes. Sometimes. (beat) But you never listened. 
HARVEY The parties Jean. The fuckin' parties, where I would hear you - dressing up what I did for a living - film composer this, film composer that - trying to make it more palatable for your friends. I'm a... 
JEAN (cutting him off) Don't Harvey. 
Beat. 
HARVEY What is it you see in Brian? 
Beat. 
SUSAN (CONT'D) You having to leave early this weekend. I don't know, it just seems typical. 
HARVEY (flash of irritation) It's work darling. It pays for things. (beat/sighs) Sorry. Look, I... 
SUSAN (interrupting) I'm sorry Dad, but it's what I've decided. 
Harvey momentarily turns away from his daughter, to compose himself, before turning back. 
HARVEY Sure. (beat) I understand, Suz. 
Harvey leans in and kisses his daughter on the forehead. 
HARVEY (CONT'D) You go and be with your friends. Go and enjoy yourself. (pulls out his phone) I gotta make some stupid calls. You know. Go and enjoy yourself, Sweetheart. I'll see you tomorrow. 
Susan reluctantly walks away as Harvey lifts the phone to his ear. We hold on his face. With Susan gone he lowers the phone. He looks frightened. 
INT. MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Harvey enters the rest-room and heads to a bank of basins. He turns on a tap and bends down - drinking profusely. He splashes his face then rises and begins to dry it with some paper towels. 
HARVEY You fuckin' asshole! 
Harvey suddenly bends over as though he'd been punched hard in the stomach. He rises, red in the face, holding his nose, desperately trying to hold it in. But he can't - Harvey sobs huge heaving muffled cries... 
Just then, someone enters. Head down, Harvey lunges for the door and exits. 
EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
Harvey stumbles out of the restaurant and into a waiting cab. The cab pulls away. 
INT. PUB - NIGHT 
Kate sits surrounded by laughter. Simon's attention is firmly fixed on his friends. Kate's humiliation is magnified as we slowly move into her face. 
KATE Sorry. 
Kate gets up and walks away. Everyone momentarily stops chatting and looks to Simon, who shrugs. 
INT. LADIES - NIGHT 
Kate enters a cubicle. She sits down to have a pee. We hold on her sad face. She suddenly grimaces, before holding firm. But not before a tear has been expelled and rolls down her cheek. She swats it away. 
INT. TAXI - NIGHT 
We hold on Harvey's sad face as it gently bobs in the back of a moving cab. 
EXT. PUB - NIGHT 
Kate exits the pub, just as a cab pulls up. As Harvey exits one side, Kate gets into the other, as the cab pulls away again. 
FADE TO BLACK. 
FADE IN: 
INT. REGISTRY OFFICE - MORNING 
Bride and Groom stand at the head of the room, saying their vows. Harvey stands near the back, looking on. As the ceremony is concluded the audience spontaneously burst into applause. Harvey looks around the room, then back at his daughter, as she smiles giddily at her husband. Harvey slips out the door. 
EXT. STREET - DAY 
Carrying his case, Harvey hails a Taxi and gets in. 
INT. TERMINAL 3 - DAY 
Kate, back in green, stands next to a young couple asking them questions about their travel arrangements. 
EXT. STREET - DAY 
Harvey looks about him. 
INT. TERMINAL 3 - DAY 
Harvey sits holding his phone. He dials a number, lifting the phone to his ear. He gets voice-mail. 
HARVEY Marvin. It's Harvey. Listen, there's been a mess up, the traffic was crazy. I'm going to have to reschedule the pitch slightly. Frank can set up. I'll email him the cue numbers - he knows what to do. And then I'll be there lunch- time at the latest. I'll come straight from the airport. I'll try you again shortly. 
Harvey hangs up and stares at the phone. Beat. He looks up and around the Terminal. A young child has a tantrum nearby. Suddenly his phone rings. 
HARVEY (CONT'D) Hello? 
MARVIN I got your message. 
HARVEY The traffic was insane. But listen... 
MARVIN (interrupting) The traffic, Harvey? Jesus! 
Beat. Marvin sighs. 
MARVIN (CONT'D) Listen, Harvey. Stay in London. Enjoy your daughter's wedding. We'll talk when you get back. 
HARVEY It's fine, I'll be there lunch- time. It's no problem. Steve knows what I need. Mike's coming in. It's all set u... 
MARVIN (interrupting) Harvey! 
Silence. 
MARVIN (CONT'D) It's over. (beat/sighs) It's out of my hands Harvey. I have people to answer to. We just can't afford the space. (beat) We're letting you go. 
HARVEY Letting me go? Can't afford the space? Marvin, I'll be there lunch- time. 
Beat. 
MARVIN I'm sorry Harvey. (beat/sighs) Call me when you get back. 
The line goes dead. Harvey closes his phone. Beat. He stares ahead into space, then stands and walks away. 
INT. BOOTH - DAY 
Kate closes up the booth. 
INT. TERMINAL 3 / CHEZ GERARD (BAR/RESTAURANT) - DAY 
Kate sits at a table near the bar, drinking a glass of wine and reading her book. She glances up as a man enters. Harvey takes a seat at the bar. 
HARVEY Jamesons, no ice. 
The Barman serves Harvey. Harvey immediately downs it. 
HARVEY (CONT'D) Another. (beat) Please. 
The Barman refills his glass. Again Harvey knocks it back. Kate glances up from her book. 
HARVEY (CONT'D) Another, please. 
The Barman glances at Harvey. 
HARVEY (CONT'D) What? 
BAR MAN Sorry. 
Harvey reaches for the now full glass. But knocks it, spilling it into his lap. 
HARVEY Shit! 
Kate looks up again, along with the few other patrons in the bar. Harvey registers their gaze. 
HARVEY (CONT'D) Sorry. Vulgar American. 
HARVEY What? 
KATE That's all changed. We're a nation changed. Ever since Diana, we've unlocked ourselves. Everything's flowing out. (beat) You guys showed us the way. 
HARVEY Just as we're trying to adopt your stiff upper lip. 
Kate smiles. 
HARVEY (CONT'D) What is a stiff upper lip, exactly? 
Harvey tries to physicalize it. 
KATE No, I think, it's more this. 
Kate stretches her top lip. 
HARVEY I see. (copies her) How's that? 
KATE (top lip stretched) Yeah you're getting there. Stretch it out further. 
HARVEY Let me see again. 
KATE No, now you're doing a bulldog. 
HARVEY Like this? 
KATE No, now you look like you don't have any teeth. (beat) Are they your own? 
HARVEY What? 
KATE Your teeth? 
HARVEY The front ones. 
KATE My dad had a front one that you could just take out. 
HARVEY Really? 
As they sit there, lips stretched, nattering away, we start to pull back. Accompanied by a simple piano score we look on as they appear to us, momentarily, like an ordinary couple. 
EXT. CHEZ GERARD - DAY 
Harvey and Kate exit the restaurant. They stand opposite each other in the quietening Terminal. 
KATE Thank you. I...enjoyed myself. 
HARVEY Yes. So did I. 
Slightly awkward pause. Kate glances at her watch. 
KATE I should get going. I have a class. 
HARVEY A class? 
KATE (a bit sheepish) Yes. A...writing class. (beat) Twice a week. Just something I do. (changing the subject) (MORE) 
KATE (CONT'D) I take the Heathrow Express. What about you? 
Harvey hadn't really thought. 
HARVEY I don't know. I guess I'll stay in a Hotel near here. My flight's in the morning. 
Beat. 
KATE Well...it's been a pleasure...Harvey Shine. 
HARVEY Yes. Yes it has. 
They shake hands, smiling. Just then Kate's phone rings again. 
Harvey drops his suitcase off at the same hotel he was staying in before. 
As they wander through the city, foreign students mingle, policemen chat, and office workers linger. London is at its best. 
EXT. SOUTH BANK - LATE AFTERNOON 
The sky glows a pale orange as Harvey and Kate walk and talk along the South Bank. 
HARVEY Yours is a beautiful city, Kate. 
Kate looks at Harvey a moment, then smiles. 
HARVEY (CONT'D) What? 
KATE Its just a funny way of saying it. Quite old fashioned. 
HARVEY Really? 
KATE But i like it. (beat) Yours is glorious country, Honeychurch. 
Harvey looks at Kate quizzically. 
KATE (CONT'D) It's a line from a book. `Room with a View'. 
Harvey shakes his head. 
HARVEY I'm afraid I'm not much of a reader. (beat) Too fidgety, I guess. 
Kate looks at Harvey. 
HARVEY (CONT'D) You think less of me. 
KATE No, we're just quite different, that's all. 
HARVEY Is that bad? 
KATE (thinks about it) No. 
Just then Kate's phone rings again. 
HARVEY Both our phones ring a lot. We have that in common. 
KATE (smiles) Ah. 
They come to a stop as Kate takes out her phone and looks at the handset display. 
KATE (CONT'D) Sorry. I should probably take this. 
Harvey nods. 
KATE (CONT'D) Mum? (beat) I've been busy. (beat) No, I'm out. Yes with someone. No someone else. (beat) Yes. (looks at Harvey) ...a man. 
Harvey smiles. We hear Maggie's warble continue as Kate listens. Beat. 
KATE (CONT'D) You did, did you? (beat) An actual body. 
Harvey looks at Kate. Kate shakes her head. Maggie continues. 
KATE (CONT'D) Mum. Listen. I'll come over tomorrow and we can check it out together. (beat) I have to go now. Just get an early night and i'll see you tomorrow. (beat) I love you too. 
Kate hangs up. 
KATE (CONT'D) Sorry. (beat) My mother. 
HARVEY She worries about you? 
KATE And herself. (beat) She's convinced she's living next to Poland's answer to Ted Bundy. 
HARVEY I see. 
Harvey and Kate walk under Waterloo bridge past the second hand bookstalls. A man plays a saxophone melancholically. 
KATE Do you ever wish you could try a different life? (beat) Just for a day. Just to see what it would be like. 
HARVEY What would yours be? 
KATE (looks down at her uniform) Well, no green, that's for sure. 
Harvey smiles. 
KATE (CONT'D) (beat/thinks) It would take place in Spain. A little house inland. 
HARVEY And what would you do there? 
KATE Oh...I don't know... (beat) Write the great novel. (beat) I think I've got one inside me. We're not talking high art. Just a bloody good holiday read. 
Beat. 
HARVEY Ok. So this house in Spain would have a little cabana looking out over the plains for you to write in. 
KATE (smiling) Yes. 
HARVEY And a little stream running by, to bathe in. 
KATE (smiling) Sure. 
HARVEY I'm there. (beat) Sorry, that's if you're receiving guests. 
Kate smiles, coming to a stop. 
KATE Sure, you can visit Harvey Shine. 
HARVEY Why, thank you Kate Walker. 
Just then a sort of Skiffle come Rockabilly busking act starts up. Two girls and a guy. They're great! Harvey and Kate stand amongst the crowd watching. The South Bank is at its vibrant best. 
EXT. SOUTH BANK - DUSK 
With the sound of the Skiffle act still playing in the distant background, Harvey and Kate take a seat on some steps over-looking the river. As darkness descends, street-lamps reflect off the water. They sit in silence. Then... 
KATE What happened Harvey? (beat) Between you and your daughter? 
Beat. Harvey shakes his head. 
HARVEY I don't know. (beat) Somewhere along the way I lost her. I lost my family. (beat) I just woke up one morning and realised i didn't belong. 
Beat. 
HARVEY (CONT'D) I'd always had this mean little feeling in my stomach, that they were a bit embarrassed by me. (beat) If you saw them now, with Brian, Susan's step-father. You'd see, they make more sense. They look right together. 
Beat. Harvey looks out over the Thames. 
HARVEY (CONT'D) I've not been a great father. 
Kate looks at Harvey's sad profile. Beat. She thinks for a moment. 
KATE The reception. It's still going on? 
HARVEY (looks at his watch) I guess. 
KATE Where? 
Harvey looks up. 
HARVEY The Grovesnor. Why? 
Kate looks at Harvey. 
KATE You must go. 
The doors open and Harvey and Kate enter. Heads turn. Jean looks up and sees Harvey with Kate. She shakes her head. Susan sees Harvey and gets up. She joins him. 
HARVEY Hey. 
SUSAN Hi. 
HARVEY I didn't go. 
SUSAN I'm glad. 
Off Susan's look, Harvey turns to Kate. 
HARVEY This is Kate. A... friend. 
KATE (sheepish) Hi. Congratulations. You look fantastic. 
SUSAN Thank you. 
Slightly awkward pause. 
KATE I'm really sorry to gate-crash. Your father sort of insisted. 
SUSAN No, it's fine. I'm sure... (looks around) ...there's room. 
Susan looks back at the full top table. 
HARVEY You get back. Don't worry about us, we'll find a place. 
KATE Yes... 
SUSAN No. (stops a passing waiter) Could you find them a seat please. 
WAITER Sure. 
Pete, acting as Master of Ceremonies, stands and clinks his glass for attention. 
SUSAN I'd better go. 
PETE (MC) And now for the best man's speech. Except we seem to be missing the bride. (laughter) Oh, no, here she is. 
Susan heads back and resumes her seat at top table. The best man takes the mic... 
JOSH Scott. What can I say... 
INT. RECEPTION / BACK TABLES 
The waiter leads Harvey and Kate to a table. 
WAITER I'm afraid this is the only place left. 
The waiter shows them to a few empty seats at the children's table. 
HARVEY That's fine. 
Harvey and Kate take their seats. The kids stare at them. 
KATE Hi. 
A brace clad, large girl in a white frilly dress speaks. 
GIRL Are you Uncle Harvey? 
HARVEY Yes. I guess. 
GIRL I've heard about you. 
HARVEY Oh. (beat) You're not Miriam's kid are you? 
GIRL Yes. 
HARVEY (smiling) And also if he ever hurts her, I know people in north of London. 
Laughter. 
HARVEY (CONT'D) Seriously though. Scott, I swear you have found in Susan a bright and passionate person. And a loyal friend. 
CONGREGATION Hear, hear! 
HARVEY And I can see from the way she looks at you. From the way she is with you, that she is... (beat) (MORE) 
HARVEY (CONT'D) ...happy. (beat) And I thank you and welcome you to the family. 
Harvey and Scott share a look. The room applauds loudly. 
HARVEY (CONT'D) And finally, if I can linger a moment longer. I would like to turn it back over to Brian, with a note of... gratitude. (beat) Thank you for being there for my baby girl. Thank you for being there, when I wasn't. 
Beat. Brian nods to Harvey, before standing and raising his glass. 
BRIAN If you would all please join Harvey and I, in a toast. (beat) To Susan and Scott. 
CONGREGATION Susan and Scott! 
Everyone claps loudly. Susan shares a gentle smile with her Father. Harvey sits and looks at Kate anxiously. Kate smiles and nods. 
KATE Well done. 
HARVEY Really? 
She indicates to the rest of the table. Harvey turns to their now animated young neighbours, who all sit clapping. 
INT. RECEPTION / BANDSTAND - NIGHT 
PETE (MC) Ladies and Gentlemen, the first dance. 
The BAND strike up as Susan and Scott take to the dance floor. They dance a slow dance. Harvey and Kate sit watching. 
After a while Susan, looks over for her Father. Harvey hesitates, before Kate encourages him up. She plucks a flower from the table display and places it in his lapel. 
Harvey joins Susan and Scott on the dance-floor. Shaking Scott's hand, he leads Susan into a dance. 
SUSAN Thanks for coming back Dad. 
Beat. 
HARVEY Thanks for having me back. 
Kate looks on, as Harvey dances happily with his daughter. Feeling something, she turns to find the eight year old's head slumped against her shoulder as he sleeps soundly. Kate smiles at her lot. 
Back on the dance-floor, Harvey encourages Brian to take over the dance with Susan. Harvey turns away and is joined by Uncle Fred and gang. They all chat animatedly. Uncle Fred pushes Harvey into a dance with his wife. A `Boogie' strikes up. 
Kate looks on as Harvey dances and reunites with his extended family. She sees the delight in his face. She looks around at all the happy faces. It's time perhaps to let the family celebrate alone. 
Extricating herself from the sleeping boy, she pushes two chairs together and makes a bed for him. Covering him in a jacket, she glances back at the dance-floor before turning to leave. 
Back on the dance-floor, a `Boogie' is in full swing. Harvey caught up in the fun, energetically swings Aunt Maddie around. He suddenly catches himself and turns to his table to look for Kate, but finds it empty save for a row of dozing children. 
Harvey makes his excuses and turns away, looking for Kate amongst the crowded room. 
INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Kate retrieves her coat and makes her way down the hall towards the bank of elevators. 
INT. RECEPTION - NIGHT 
Harvey hurries to the exit. 
INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT 
On turning into the hall, he sees Kate standing in the distance. Just then, she steps forward and out of sight. Harvey runs. 
HARVEY Can I...? 
Just then a vacuum cleaner sounds. They both look up - as a cleaning lady vacuums the floor nearby. Beat. 
HARVEY (CONT'D) Hey kid, they're playing our song. 
Kate smiles. 
KATE Yes. 
In the background we hear clapping and cheering coming from the reception. A funky number starts up. Harvey takes Kate's hand. 
HARVEY (excited) Come on. I want you to meet people. I want them to meet you. 
Harvey leads a slightly reluctant Kate back down the hall towards the reception. 
INT. RECEPTION - NIGHT 
The band let rip on a funky tune. The congregation fill the dance-floor. 
Harvey leads Kate back into the room and heads straight for the dance-floor. As they pass relatives along the way, Harvey introduces them to Kate. Much hugging and kissing ensues. 
Harvey and Kate dance a boogie. Uncle Fred and Aunt Maddie join them. Uncle Fred steals Kate from Harvey and twirls her off. 
MONTAGE: Fun and Frolics on the dance-floor. Harvey is at the center of it all. He initiates a Horah. A Congo line. Russian dancing! Kate's face says it all - she's having a ball. The sleeping kid, sleeps. 
INT. RECEPTION / BANDSTAND - NIGHT 
Close up on the M.C. 
PETE (MC) Ladies and Gentlemen. The bride and groom are about to leave. Please join me outside to send them off in style. 
EXT. HOTEL STEPS - NIGHT 
Harvey and Kate join the rest of the congregation outside on the steps of the hotel. Harvey looks on as his daughter and son-in-law head to an awaiting car. Susan stops and throws the bouquet behind her. It is caught by Aunt Maddie, who in turn throws it and it is caught by Harvey's `all grown up' niece. She blushes profusely revealing an impressive set of braces on her teenage teeth. 
Susan kisses her mother and Brian goodbye. And is about to get into the car when she stops and hurries over to Harvey. 
SUSAN Bye Dad. 
HARVEY Bye Suz... Bye Susan. 
She hugs him tightly. Pulling away she turns to Kate. 
SUSAN Be gentle with him. 
Kate nods as Susan turns to leave. 
HARVEY (to Kate) Sorry. 
Kate smiles. As the car pulls away, everyone   cheers. Harvey looks on. His eyes momentarily lock onto his   ex-wife's. They share a conciliatory look. As Harvey watches   his daughter's car disappear down the street, Kate looks at   him. He turns back. Beat. 
KATE You Ok? 
HARVEY Yes. Yes, I am. 
Beat. Harvey looks around. 
HARVEY (CONT'D) You wanna get out of here? 
KATE Sure. 
EXT. MEWS STREET - NIGHT/DAWN 
Harvey and Kate walk. The streets are quiet. There is already a hint of dawn in the sky. Rubbish trucks manoeuvre. 
EXT. SOMMERSET HOUSE - DAWN 
They turn into the courtyard of Sommerset House and take a seat on some chairs. The sky lightens. 
HARVEY I know enough to know, I'll be here. Waiting, at this chair. 
Kate looks at Harvey, then again towards the street. 
KATE Sure, Harvey. 
HARVEY Noon. I mean it. (beat) I'll be here. 
Kate smiles a little smile. She suddenly believes him. 
KATE Ok. 
She steps backwards. 
HARVEY Wait. 
Harvey gets up and joins her. They look at each other. Harvey suddenly leans in and kisses Kate. 
HARVEY (CONT'D) (pulling away/can't help smiling) Sorry. 
Kate smiles. 
KATE Harvey Shine. 
HARVEY Can I have something until tomorrow. 
Kate reaches for her purse and pulls out a photo. She gives it to Harvey. 
KATE (stepping backwards) I must go. 
She turns and leaves, hurrying to catch a bus. 
Harvey stands holding an old library card. He looks down. On it is a faded photo of toothy young girl, no older than eleven. Harvey looks up and smiles. 
INT. BUS - EARLY MORNING 
Kate takes a seat on the top deck of a bus. Taking a moment to catch her breath, she looks out the window. Turning back, she allows herself a smile... 
FADE TO BLACK. 
FADE IN: 
EXT. LONDON STREET - EARLY MORNING 
Harvey, with a croissant lodged in his mouth and a cup of coffee in hand, buys a morning paper. He turns and crosses the road, skipping up the steps of his hotel. 
INT. HOTEL LOBBY - EARLY MORNING 
Harvey enters, and waving to a slightly bemused concierge, heads to the bank of elevators. 
HARVEY Morning. 
CONCIERGE I'm afraid they're both out of order, Sir. 
Harvey glances at the sign, then over to the stairwell. 
HARVEY I guess i'll walk, then. 
INT. STAIRWELL - MORNING 
Harvey, a man, seemingly impatient to start a `new life', runs up the steps. Surprised at first by his agility, he begins to slow. He stops to catch his breath. Suddenly his spare hand holds tight onto the bannister. Unsteady Harvey sits down. Close up on Harvey's face, confused. He tries to stand but again is forced back down. He begins to place his coffee on the stair next to him, but suddenly shudders, grabbing his shoulder. The coffee topples, spilling down the steps. 
HARVEY Shit. 
Frightened and confused, Harvey sits alone in the stairwell. 
Just then, a door opens and the African porter from before, comes through, carrying a tray. He sees Harvey. 
PORTER Sir, are you Ok? 
Kate smiles. 
MAGGIE (CONT'D) Are you sure you're going to be alright? 
KATE Of course I will. I'll be fine. 
MAGGIE Men, who needs them. Remember we've got Greece to look forward to. 
Resigned, Kate hugs her mum. 
KATE Yeah. 
Kate leaves. 
EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY 
Kate exits her mother's house and passes Paddy the Postman. 
PADDY Morning Kate. 
KATE Morning Paddy.

KATE (resigned) Thank you. 
Kate walks off down the street. 
INT. HOSPITAL / RECEPTION AREA - DAY 
Harvey stands at a counter in a busy reception area. He has his phone lodged in the crook of his neck. In front of him, lies an open phone directory. 
HARVEY It's some sort of Statistics Agency. (listens) Yes. That sounds right. Yes, based out at Heathrow. (listens) Thank you. Hold on. (turns to a receptionist) Miss, could I borrow, your pen. 
The receptionist obliges as Harvey scribbles down a number on an old envelope. 
HARVEY (CONT'D) Thanks, thanks alot. 
INT. HEATHROW / O.N.S. BOOTH - DAY 
A phone rings behind the counter. Oonagh picks up. 
OONAGH O.N.S., Heathrow branch. (beat) Hold on. (MORE) 
OONAGH (CONT'D) (calling out) Kate it's for you. Some guy called Harvey. 
Kate, stands nearby, holding a clipboard, about to head out onto the floor. She looks at Oonagh. She thinks for a beat, then shakes her head, silently gesturing she not there. Oonagh, a little perplexed goes back on the phone. 
OONAGH (CONT'D) Um, I'm sorry. She's not here. 
INT. HOSPITAL / RECEPTION AREA - DAY 
Harvey, phone to ear, thinks for a beat. He knows she's there. 
HARVEY Please. It's important. 
Beat. 
OONAGH Hold on.

Oonagh pulls the phone away and gestures again to Kate. Kate shakes her head. Beat. Oonagh reluctantly lifts the phone to her ear. 
OONAGH I'm sorry, she's busy. (beat) She won't come. 
Oonagh hangs up, looking at Kate. Kate shrugs defensively before turning to go. We hold on Kate's `confused' face as she walks away. 
INT. HOSPITAL / RECEPTION AREA - DAY 
Aggie tuts and calls behind her. 
AGGIE There's a man here looking for Kate, says he's `more than a friend.' 
OONAGH (O.S.) More than a friend?! 
Oonagh comes out from the office, eyeing Harvey suspiciously. 
OONAGH (CONT'D) You're the American. (long beat) She likes you. I can tell. (beat) Now, don't you go messing her around. Don't you hurt her. 
HARVEY I wouldn't. I won't. 
Beat. Oonagh continues to eye Harvey. Finally... 
OONAGH She's not here. 
HARVEY Oh. 
OONAGH She's left for the day. (beat) But you might find her at her class. (looks at her watch) I think it starts around now. Down on the Southbank. At the National. 
HARVEY Yes, I know. 
OONAGH Oh you do, do you? (beat) Well, go on. Go get her. 
HARVEY Thank you. 
Harvey turns and hurries away. Oonagh and Aggie share a smile. 
INT. WRITING CLASS - DAY 
MIKE The blood oozes from his wound like dark chocolate on a warm summer's day. 
Kate sits listening in a daze, as `mild-mannered Mike' unleashes his latest.

EXT. SOUTHBANK - DAY 
Kate comes down from the upper terrace of the National, saying her good-byes to her classmates. In her hand she holds a book. As she turns she sees Harvey coming to a stop in the distance. She momentarily falters before approaching. 
KATE Hey. 
HARVEY Hey. 
KATE You're still here - still in London... 
HARVEY Yeah. (beat) Kate, I just wanted to apologise and explain... 
KATE No, you don't have to - explain - it's fine - 
HARVEY No, but I do - 
KATE I don't need to hear - it's fine, seriously. 
HARVEY But I want to... (comes out) I had to go to Hospital. 
KATE Oh, God! Why?! 
HARVEY No, it's nothing, I'm fine, I just forgot to take my pills. I have this condition, I've had it since I was a kid - it's an irregular heart- beat sort of thing.

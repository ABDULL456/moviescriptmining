PRETTY WOMAN 
FINAL SCRIPT 
by Jonathan Frederick Lawton 
From the original script written by J.F. Lawton, with the help of Stephen Metcalfe, Barbara Benedek, Robert Garland and probably Garry Marshall (the director of the film) himself. This original script itself was adapted from Lawton's first script called «Three Thousand», which was a much darker story about prostitution and drugs.

AND THEN : 
IN ASSOCIATION WITH 
SILVER SCREEN PARTNERS IV 
We hear voices over of people chattering and laughing. 
MAN (voice over) Broke in right on the two of them. Caught them. 
MAGICIAN (voice over) No matter what they say, it's all about money. 
FADE TO : 
PHILIP'S RESIDENCE - PATIO - EXTERIOR DAY 
We are in Philip Stuckey's residence on the Hollywood Hills. Apparently, a party is in progress. 
Close Up on the Magician's hands and the hands of two ladies. The magician is doing tricks with coins in the ladies' hands. 
MAGICIAN (voice over) So let's imagine, ladies, that you're a Savings and Loan officer. Watch. One, two, three. See ? 
On lady has got three coin in her hand, and the other one only one. The magician takes the three coins from the first lady's hand, and closes it. Then he takes the only coin from the other lady's hand, but leaves it open. He puts the four coins in his hand and closes it. 
Credits appears in white capital letters on the screen. 
MAGICIAN (voice over) You've got it all, and we've got nothing. And you have all four. Just take a look. 
He opens his hand, which is empty. Then he opens the first lady's hand, which contains the four coins. 
WOMAN (voice over) Oh ! 
MAGICIAN (voice over) But I wouldn't trust you with real gold. That's why this one's only worth about a penny. 
He takes one of the coins from the first lady's hand, hides it in his hand, and makes it appears again changed into a huge penny coin. 
End of the first set of credits. 
MAN (voice over) Hmm. 
MAGICIAN (voice over) And if you wonder where the other one went, watch. 
His left hand moves to the first lady's' ear, and gets the missing penny out of it. 
PHILIP A penny from the ear. How much for the rest ? 
Philip Stuckey, the host, walks behind the magician. Philip is a short man in his forties, with receding hair. He looks, at the same time, obsequious and domineering. His guests laugh at his joke. Philip moves toward a young man. 
The camera follows Philip. 
PHILIP Have you seen Edward ? 
THE YOUNG MAN No, I haven't. Great party, Philip. 
PHILIP Well, my wife went to a lot of trouble : she called a caterer. 
He walks to a group of guest gathered around a large buffet table. Behind the table, the balustrade of the patio, and in the background, Hollywood Hills. 
PHILIP Excuse me, Ann. Howard, how are you ? 
HOWARD Philip, good. Hey, I understand Edward's taking over Morse Industries. 
PHILIP Yeah, well, he's not here to get a suntan. 
HOWARD Can I get in on it ? 
PHILIP Yeah. Call me. 
HOWARD When ? 
PHILIP Just call me. 
He turns to another guest and shake hands with him. 
PHILIP Uh, hi. I'm Philip Stuckey, Edward Lewis's lawyer. 
THE GUEST Hey, where's the guest of honor anyway ? 
PHILIP Well, if I know this fellow, he's probably off in a corner somewhere charming a very pretty lady. 
He turns to a charming lady talking with a man. 
PHILIP How are you ? 
He gives her a kiss. 
PHILIP'S RESIDENCE - STUDY - INTERIOR DAY 
Very modern design. An artistic picture of a nude girl on the wall. 
Medium shot of Edward Lewis standing near the desk, talking on the telephone. He is a very handsome man in his early forties. He is very elegantly dressed, apparently with a very expensive suit. 
EDWARD I told my secretary to make the arrangements. Didn't she call you ? 
JESSICA (voice over on the telephone) Yes, she did. I speak to your secretary more than I speak to you. 
EDWARD I see. 
JESSICA (voice over on the telephone) I have my own life too, you know, Edward. 
EDWARD This is a very important week for me. I need you here. 
He walks to the large bay window, overlooking Hollywood Hills. 
JESSICA (voice over on the telephone) But you never give me any notice. You just think I'm at your beck and call. 
EDWARD I do not believe that you are at my beck and call. 
JESSICA (voice over on the telephone) Well, that's the way you always make me feel. Maybe I should just move out. 
EDWARD If that's what you want, yes. 
JESSICA (voice over on the telephone) All right, when you get back to New York, we'll discuss it. 
EDWARD Now is as good a time as any. 
JESSICA (voice over on the telephone) That's fine with me, Edward. Good-bye. 
She hangs up. 
EDWARD Good-bye, Jessica. 
Edward looks down, through the bay window, to the party still going on on the patio on the floor below. We can hear the chatter from the party.

YOUNG MAN I don't know.

The last set of credits starts in white capital letters on this overview. 
The music keeps on playing. 
LYRICS We were never carved in stone. If I don't listen to the talk of the town. Then maybe I can fool myself. I'll get over you I know I will. I'll pretend my ship's not sinking. And I'll tell myself I'm over you.

SIDE STREET IN HOLLYWOOD - EXTERIOR NIGHT 
Medium long shot on a very quiet side street near Hollywood Boulevard. The street seems even much quieter after all the noise and the hustle we've seen on the Boulevard itself. 
The credits are still appearing and disappearing on the screen. 
An ambulance is driving very fast along the street, with its siren wailing. On the side of the ambulance is written : «Los Angeles Fire Department», and below : «Paramedic». 
The camera lets the ambulance go and moves to show us a shady- looking building with a vertical neon sign saying «HOTEL», but only the «H» and the «O» are lit, the others letters being out of order. 
The music fades out. 
This building actually is partly a regular hotel, and partly a place that rents small apartments on a monthly basis. 
VIVIAN AND KIT'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT 
We are in the small apartment rented by Vivian Ward and Kit De Luca, two young prostitutes, whom we are going to know better later on.

KIT Hey, let's go. Snack ! Snack ! She has reached the bar and starts picking bits of food in plates on the counter. 
KIT Besides, it's my apartment. 
VIVIAN Yeah, well, I have to live there too, Kit. 
KIT Look, you came here. I gave you some money. I gave you a place to stay... 
Close Up on Kit's hands picking food (olives, onions, cherries...) in the snack plates, and putting them on a paper napkin. 
KIT ...and some valuable vocational advice. He was on my case. I had to give him something. 
Back to the two girls behind the bar. 
KIT So don't irritate me. 
POPS This ain't a buffet, Kit. 
Kit moves around Vivian, sits on a stool at the bar, and starts eating. 
VIVIAN Irritate you ? Irritate you ? I just saw a girl pulled out of a Dumpster. 
She sits down on another stool. 
KIT I know. Skinny Marie. But... she was a... a flake. She was a crack head. Dominic was trying to straighten her out for months. 
We hear people shouting in the background and glass being broken. The two girls turns their heads around for a second and then come back to their conversation at the bar. 
WOMAN (voice over) Leave her alone !

RACHEL Yeah. 
KIT Well, Vivian and me, we work Bob Hope, we work the Ritz Brothers, we work Fred Astaire, we work all the way down to Ella Fitzgerald. This is our turf. We got seniority. You better get off our corner. 
RACHEL Forgive me. I was just taking a rest here. Besides, she's new. 
KIT Yeah. Well, I'm old, so go rest up by Monty Hall or Esther Wilson. 
RACHEL Williams. 
KIT Esther Williams ! Where you belong ! 
RACHEL Back off, Kit. You know, you're really becoming a grouch. 
She walks away on the boulevard. Kit turns toward Vivian. 
KIT Am I really a grouch ? 
VIVIAN Yes. Sometimes. 
KIT Well, just 'cause I'm hungry. I'm gonna go get something to eat. 
We hear someone whistling, and then :

The car keeps on moving on the boulevard and out of view. Back on Vivian and Kit. 
KIT Dream on ! 
VIVIAN It's looking really slow tonight. 
She takes her cap off. 
KIT Yeah, well... maybe we should get a pimp, you know. Carlos really digs you. 
VIVIAN And then he'll run our lives and take our money. No. 
KIT You're right. We say who, we say when, we say how much. 
VIVIAN Do you think I look like Carol Channing ?

Full shot on the boulevard. The Lotus is driving along the boulevard. The car bounces a little, while the gears are grinding. 
Back to the two girls watching the car. Vivian points to it.

VIVIAN They bought them cheap and fixed them up. I paid attention. So how is it you know so little about cars ? 
EDWARD My first car was a limousine. 
VIVIAN Oh. 
EDWARD So where is this... 
He tries to shift gears and gets another grinding noise. 
EDWARD ...heavy metal... home ? 
VIVIAN Milledgeville, Georgia. You know, I think you left your transmission back there. You're not shifting right. This is a standard «H».

EDWARD Okay. 
VIVIAN Here we go. 
She adjusts the back-view mirror.

Several shots of the car racing along the streets. 
Shot of the the couple through the windshield. 
VIVIAN This has pedals like a race car. They're really close together. So it's probably easier for a woman to drive, because they have little feet. Except me. I wear a size nine. 
LOTUS ESPRIT - INTERIOR NIGHT 
VIVIAN You know your foot's as big as your arm from your elbow to your wrist ? 
She shows her arm to Edward, who chuckles. 
VIVIAN Did you know that ?

EDWARD Tell me, what kind of... what kind of money you girls make these days ? Ballpark. 
VIVIAN Can't take less than a hundred dollars. 
EDWARD A hundred dollars a night ? 
VIVIAN For an hour. 
EDWARD An hour ? You make a hundred dollars an hour and you got a safety pin holding your boot up ? You gotta be joking. 
LOTUS ESPRIT - INTERIOR NIGHT 
VIVIAN I never joke about money. 
EDWARD Neither do I. Hundred dollars an hour. Pretty stiff. 
She puts her right hand on Edward's zipper. 
VIVIAN Well, no. But it's got potential. 
Edward doesn't react, but he looks at her in such a way that she feels she has better take her hand off his zipper.

Medium full shot on the Lotus parked in front of the hotel. The attendant opens the passenger's door of the car, while Vivian comes out of the car on her own. 
HOTEL ATTENDANT Good evening, Mr. Lewis. Will you be needing the car anymore tonight ? 
EDWARD (LAUGHING) I... I hope not ! 
He gets out of the car. The attendant closes the door and then moves away, while Vivian joins Edward on the sidewalk. 
VIVIAN Ah. You're here. 
EDWARD Yeah. He looks at her for a couple of second, before talking again. 
EDWARD So you'll be all right ? 
VIVIAN Yeah, I'm gonna grab a cab with my twenty bucks. 
EDWARD Go back to your office. 
She laughs. 
VIVIAN Yeah. My office. Yeah.

On the TV screen, Lucy now seems to be enjoying her grapes stomping. 
Still resting on her knees, Vivian is taking her white top off her shoulders. She slips it down, and because the top is attached to the skirt, the skirt comes down with it. Vivian is now wearing only her black lace underwear and bra. Vivian puts the top and the skirt away from her on the floor, and bends down on the seated Edward. Suddenly, she stands up and walks away. Edward seems surprised. But she comes back with a cushion that she drops on the floor, and then kneels on it. She takes the TV remote control from the table by the sofa, and presses a button on it. 
On the TV screen, Lucy and the Italian lady are still stomping the grapes, but the sound shuts off. 
Back to the sofa. Closer shot. Vivian puts the remote control back on the table. Then she leans on Edward, and starts taking his necktie off. Edward puts his hand on her hair, and seems surprised : he hadn't realized it was a wig. Quick shot on the TV screen, where Lucy and her Italian friend are now dancing on the grapes. 
Back to the sofa, where Vivian is taking Edward's pants off. She opens his shirt on his chest, and bends on it. 
Close Up on their two faces, very close to each other. 
VIVIAN What do you want ? 
EDWARD What do you do ? 
VIVIAN Everything. But I don't kiss on the mouth. 
EDWARD Neither do I. 
She bends on his chest and starts kissing him on the chest, going down. She stops to look at the TV. 
On the TV screen, the Italian lady is throwing grapes in Lucy's face. 
Back to Vivian, who smiles and resumes her kissing job on Edward's chest.

At his early hour, there are not many guests in the lobby of the hotel, only a chambermaid dusting a table, and three uniformed attendants talking together. 
Barnard Thompson, the manager of the hotel, crosses the lobby, wearing a very elegant dark suit, and carrying a black briefcase. 
Barnard Thompson will be later in the film nicknames «Barney» by Vivian. It is this nickname that we shall use to refer to him in the dialogues. 
BARNEY Good morning, gentlemen. 
ONE OF THE UNIFORMED ATTENDANT Good morning, Mr. Thompson. 
BARNEY Good morning, good morning. 
He keeps on walking toward the reception desk.

EDWARD Of course Morse is going to fight. It's to be expected. He's run his company for a very long time now. I don't think he's ready to have his name taken off the stationery.

PHILIP'S RESIDENCE - DINING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY 
PHILIP Oh, Edward, Edward. I... Look, it's really not a good idea that you see him. 
A middle-aged maid walks behind him with a glass jar of coffee, fresh from the percolator. She wants to pour some coffee in Philip's cup, but, with his free hand, he moves her away. 
PHILIP Definitely not alone. 
(HE CHUCKLES) You know ? He's a feisty old guy. You know, we say the wrong thing... (He snaps his fingers) ...we could wind up in court. 
The maid walks out of the room. 
PENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY 
EDWARD Well, you know, there's always a possibility things are gonna go wrong. 
The waiter leaves the room, and Vivian walks in from the bedroom, wearing a white bathrobe.

Vivian crosses the lobby, dressed in the same prostitute outfit as the day before, but without her wig. She has her large handbag across her shoulder and her red jacket is tied around her waist. Barney gives her a quick look, but goes back to his conversation with the Italian guest. He takes the card the Italian is holding. 
BARNEY Ah ! 
Medium shot on the reception desk. Miss Wilson, a blonde bespectacled receptionist girl is behind the desk. 
VIVIAN Hi.

VIVIAN Don't open that. 
MISS WILSON No, ma'am. 
Back on Barney and the Italian guests. 
[ SPEAKING ITALIAN ] 
THE ITALIAN GUEST Multo Grazie. Arrivederci. 
BARNEY Arrivederci. 
Vivian walks near them, with the high heels of her boots clicking on the floor. The Italian starts pushing the wheelchair. Barney looks at Vivian. 
THE ITALIAN GUEST Andiamo. 
Reverse angle shot on the lobby. Vivian keeps on walking quite fast, and barely avoids bumping into an uniformed hotel attendant loaded with luggage. 
Reverse angle shot on Barney still standing at the same place. He turns his head toward the desk. 
BARNEY Miss Wilson, do you know that lady ? 
MISS WILSON No, sir. 
Barney turns back toward the departing Vivian. 
REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - EXTERIOR DAY 
Full shot of the building of the hotel. 
We hear the song «Wild Women Do», performed by Natalie Cole. 
LYRICS Wild women do. And they don't regret it. 
The camera pans down to street level and away from the hotel into Rodeo Drive. 
RODEO DRIVE - EXTERIOR DAY 
The camera pans along the expensive shop along Rodeo Drive. Many well-dressed people are walking on the sidewalk. Several are carrying bags from the shops. 
LYRICS Wild women show what they're going through. The camera crosses the street on a crosswalk. Vivian is walking on this crosswalk. 
LYRICS Ooh ! Wild women do what you think you'll never.

Several quick Close Up shots on various emblems above the shops : «Louis Vuitton», «Chanel», «Diamonds on Rodeo» «Gucci» 
LYRICS What you only dream about wild women do. 
Mediums shot. Vivian stops near a jewel shops and looks in the window at the expensive jewels. She then moves away, looking around and smiling. 
LYRICS Oh, yes, they do. Vivian keeps on walking looking up at the emblems. She apparently doesn't notice that several pedestrians are looking at her, surprised by her «costume». 
LYRICS You tell me you want a woman who is simple as a flower. 
Close shots on the beautiful clothes in the windows and then at Vivian smiling and looking at the clothes.

A third saleswoman, wearing a black jacket and standing behind a counter, looks up at Vivian. The saleswoman, who is arranging the flowers, also looks at Vivian. 
LYRICS Oooh-whoo ! Ooh, yeah. 
Vivian stops to look around and then walks to dresses hanging on a rail, and starts looking at them. 
LYRICS Wild women do what you think you'll never. 
Barney bends his head down, and Vivian also bends her head down before answering. 
BARNEY Relative ? 
VIVIAN Yes. 
BARNEY Mm-hmmm. I thought so. Then you must be his... 
Same game of bending heads down. 
VIVIAN Niece ? 
BARNEY Of course. Naturally, when Mr. Lewis leaves, I won't see you in this hotel again. I assume you have no other uncles here. 
Vivian shakes her head. She suddenly seems a bit tired by the situation. 
BARNEY Good ! Then we understand each other. I would also encourage you... to dress a little more appropriately. that'll be all. Vivian raises her hands and her voice. 
VIVIAN No, that's not all. That's what I was trying to do. I tried to go... get a dress on Rodeo Drive today, and the women wouldn't help me. And I have all this money now and no dress ! 
Vivian takes the loose jumbled banknotes from her bag and shows them to Barney. 
VIVIAN Not that I expect you to help me, but I have all of this, okay ? I have to buy a dress for dinner tonight. And nobody will help me. 
Barney takes the money out of Vivian's hands, then takes a white handkerchief out of the breast pocket of his jacket and gives it to Vivian. Then he gives her her money back. 
He walks around his desk, and picks up his telephone. 
VIVIAN Oh, man, if you're calling the cops. Yeah, call the cops. That's great. Tell 'em I said hi. 
BARNEY Women's clothing. 
Vivian looks up, a bit surprised. 
BARNEY Bridget, please. 
Vivian looks at him, and then takes the handkerchief and loudly blows her nose. 
BARNEY Yes, Bridget. Hello. This is Barnard Thompson here at the Regent Beverly Wil... 
(HE CHUCKLES) Well, thank you. Yes, but I'd like you to do a favor for me, please. I'm sending someone over. Her name is Vivian. 
Vivian looks at him and smiles. 
BARNEY (voice over) She's a special guest. She's the niece of a very special guest. 
EDWARD'S OFFICE IN L.A. - MEETING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY 
Full view of a screen, on which a film is being projected. This film shows an aerial overview of the port of Long Beach and Los Angeles, with a lot of industrial buildings along the wharves. 
PHILIP (voice over) Now, this is the jewel in Morse's crown : prime industrial properties straddling the port of Long Beach and Los Angeles. Full shot of the meeting room, with the screen in the background. Because of the dark in the room, people around the table are only shadows. Edward is standing up near the screen. 
PHILIP (voice over) The real estate possibilities are endless, but most of the yard we'll just level. 
A young man, one of Philip's assistants, walks into the room and to the place where Philip is seated. He bends down to whisper to Philip. 
THE YOUNG ASSISTANT We just got the information, Mr. Stuckey. 
PHILIP Edward, we just got the Morse update. Don, can you hold the projection, please ? 
The projection stops. Philip stands up and switches the lights on. He sighs and turns toward the young man. 
PHILIP Yeah, what ? Speak. 
THE YOUNG ASSISTANT Old Man Morse just got the inside track on a 350 million dollar contract to build destroyers for the Navy. 
Edward looks very pensive. 
Philip snickers, and looks at the young man. 
PHILIP Navy contract. I can't believe this shit. I thought you said they had nothing in the hopper on this one ! 
THE YOUNG ASSISTANT I thought they didn't. 
Shot on another man, named Mark, seated at the table. 
MARK Hey, you know, if that's true it could cost a lot more. Those stocks could go through the roof. 
PHILIP Yeah, no shit, Sherlock. 
The young man walks toward Edward, still standing up. 
THE YOUNG ASSISTANT Maybe we're lucky to get this information now, sir. See, we can still walk away from it. 
Edward doesn't answer and remains pensive. 
PHILIP Walk away ? Hey, forget it, pal. We got a thousand man- hours in on this ! Nobody's walking away from anything ! 
Philip sits down at the table, next to Mark. 
MARK Philip, I think he's right. 
PHILIP (raising his voice) Forget it, Mark. 
The two men start arguing, and since they are talking loudly together, we don't understand what they say. 
Edward, with a glass of water in his hand, comes to the table and raises his voice. 
EDWARD Gentlemen, relax ! 
The arguments between Philip and Mark stops 
EDWARD Relax ! Who do we know on the Senate Appropriations Committee ? 
PHILIP Senator Adams. 
EDWARD All right, Senator Adams. Let's find out where he is. 
Philip stands up and the young man sits down in his chair. 
EDWARD The Navy's not going to spend 350 million dollar on anything without going to Appropriations first. 
He drinks his water. 
PHILIP I don't understand what's going on here today, gentlemen. 
The young man is on the phone, trying to reach someone. 
THE YOUNG ASSISTANT Hello ? 
EDWARD That's why I hired you, Phil, to do my worrying for me. 
He picks up his briefcase. 
EDWARD I'll be in your office. Bob, if you want to send over the geologicals ? 
BOB (voice over) No problem. 
EDWARD Thank you. 
He goes out of the room. Philip follows him. 
Mark and the young blonde man sitting next to him are working on the documents in front of them. 
PHILIP (voice over) Edward.

PHILIP Who... Who is this girl you're going with ? 
THE YOUNG ASSISTANT (voice over) Yes. 
EDWARD Nobody you know. 
He enters Philip's private office. Philip turns around to go back in the meeting room, with a worried look on his face.

REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - DINING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY 
High Angle Close Up Shot on a dinner table, showing a white china plate with a smaller plate inside, and on either sides of the plates, a full set of silver cutlery (three forks of various sizes on the left-hand side of the plate, and a knife and three spoons on the other side). In front of the plate, a napkin folded in a glass. 
BARNEY (voice over) All right, Miss Vivian, one more time. Dinner napkin. 
We see Vivian's hand taking the napkin. 
VIVIAN (voice over) Dinner napkin... 
BARNEY (voice over) 
MM-MMM 
VIVIAN (voice over) ...laid gently in the lap. 
The camera pans away and we discover Vivian seated at the table in front of the plate. She puts the napkin on her laps and then her elbows on the table 
BARNEY (voice over) Good. Elbows off the table. 
She takes her elbows off the table. 
BARNEY (voice over) Don't slouch. 
The camera moves away from the table and we get a larger shot of the dining room. Uniformed waiters are setting tables behind Vivian and Barney, who is standing up behind Vivian. He points to the different forks on the table. 
BARNEY Shrimp fork, salad fork, dinner fork. 
VIVIAN I definitely have the salad fork. The rest of the silverware is a little confusing. 
The camera moves back again giving a full view of the dining room, with Barney and Vivian's table in the forefront. A black case is open on the table : inside a impressive collection of silver cutlery. 
Barney picks up the different forks and shows them to Vivian. 
BARNEY All right, if you get nervous, just count the tines. Four tines : dinner fork. And sometimes there are three tines in the salad fork. And sometimes... 
REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - EXTERIOR LATE AFTERNOON 
A large grey limousine is driving slowly on Rodeo Drive, and comes to park in front of the hotel. 
REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - LOBBY - INTERIOR LATE AFTERNOON 
Edward crosses the lobby, carrying his briefcase. He stops to look around, expecting to see Vivian waiting for him. He starts walking again, still looking around him. Barney catches up with him. Edward doesn't stop walking, and Barney has to talk while walking. 
BARNEY Pardon me, Mr. Lewis. I'm Mr. Thompson. I'm the manager of the hotel. 
Edward stops at a marble shelf with a row of courtesy telephones on it. He hardly listens to what Barney is telling him. 
EDWARD Uh-huh. Excuse me, I just want to make one call. 
He picks up a telephone but keeps looking around him. He seems a bit worried. 
BARNEY Yes, um, sir. I have a message for you, sir. 
EDWARD From who ? 
BARNEY From your niece, sir. 
Edward, for the first time, looks at Barney. His finger is on the dial of the phone, but he doesn't dial. 
EDWARD My what ? 
BARNEY The young lady who's staying with you in your room, sir. 
EDWARD Oh. Hmm. 
Edward smiles and puts down the telephone receiver which he had already put to his ear. 
EDWARD I think we both know that she's not my niece. 
BARNEY Of course. 
EDWARD The reason I know that is that I am an only child. 
BARNEY Yes, sir. 
EDWARD What's the message ? 
BARNEY She's waiting for you in the lounge. Intriguing young lady, Miss Vivian. 
Edward remains pensive for a couple of seconds before answering. 
EDWARD Intriguing. 
Edward picks up his briefcase which he had put on the telephone shelf. 
BARNEY Have a good evening, sir. 
EDWARD Thank you, Mr... ? 
He walks away. 
BARNEY Thompson. I'm the manager... 
He takes his business card out of the pocket of his vest to give it to Edward, but Edward is already gone. 
BARNEY ...manager of the hotel, sir. 
REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - LOUNGE - INTERIOR NIGHT 
The lounge of the hotel is a cosy place with potted green plants, comfortable armchair and soft piano music. Medium shot of Edward entering the lounge. The camera then follows Edward crossing the lounge toward the bar. 
Larger shot of the lounge, with the bar in the background. There are not many people at this early time of the evening. 
Medium shot of the bar. Only one person is seated on a stool at the bar. Even if we see only her back, we guess she is Vivian. But Edward doesn't seem to recognize her, because he keeps looking around for her. 
As Edward is looking the other way from the bar, Vivian turns around and looks at him. Edward walks a couple of steps toward the door, and then turns around and eventually notices Vivian. 
Medium shot on Edward. There is a look of surprise in Edward's eyes when he recognizes Vivian. 
Back to Vivian still seated at the bar. She doesn't look like the Vivian we were used to see. She is wearing a very elegant dark- colored cocktail dress. Her hair also has been very elegantly styled. Edward looks at her without moving for a few seconds. 
She stands up from the bar and walks toward him. 
VIVIAN You're late. 
EDWARD You're stunning. 
She laughs. 
VIVIAN You're forgiven. 
EDWARD Shall we go to dinner ? 
He gives her his arm. She puts her arm inside his arm and they walk across the lounge toward the exit. 
RESTAURANT «LE VOLTAIRE» - INTERIOR NIGHT 
High angle shot of the whole restaurant. It looks like a very expensive place. Tables are scattered around the room and on the gallery, but not too close to one another. In the middle of the room, a larger table used only by the waiters. 
We see Edward and Vivian crossing the room, with a maitre d'hotel walking in front of them. 
MAITRE D'HOTEL This way, Mr. Lewis. Your party is waiting. 
EDWARD Stop fidgeting. Closer high angle shot of Vivian and Edward walking toward a table where two men, an old one and a younger one, are already seated. 
EDWARD Mr. Morse. 
The two men stand up. The older one is James «Jim» Morse and the younger one is his grandson, David Morse. 
VIVIAN I'm sorry too. 
EDWARD Mr. Morse, you asked for this meeting. What can I do for you ? 
JAMES MORSE Leave my company alone. 
EDWARD I can't do that. I own ten million shares. 
JAMES MORSE I'll buy your stock back. 
EDWARD You don't have the money. 
DAVID MORSE We will. We're getting a contract to build ten destroyers. 
EDWARD There will be no contract. The contract is now buried in Appropriations Committee. And it will remain there. 
DAVID MORSE And how the hell did you pull something like that ? You got dirty politicians in your pockets now or something ? 
JAMES MORSE (voice over) Easy, easy, calm down. Calm down, David. 
Quick shots at Edward with a slight ironical smile on his face, and then at Vivian, looking embarrassed. 
JAMES MORSE Mr. Lewis plays hardball. 
EDWARD Yes, yes, I do. 
David slams his napkin on the table 
DAVID MORSE I've heard enough of this. Vivian, it was a great pleasure to meet you. I'm sorry, Grandfather. I've gotta get some air. Mr. Lewis. He stands up and walks away. 
JAMES MORSE I'd better join my grandson. You two enjoy your dinner. 
He stands up. 
JAMES MORSE I'm sure it'll be delicious. Good luck, miss. 
Edward stands up. James Morse comes close to him. 
JAMES MORSE Watch out, Lewis. I'm gonna tear you apart. 
EDWARD I look forward to it, sir. 
He walks away. 
Vivian looks more and more embarrassed. 
EDWARD Rich people throw their napkins a lot, don't they ? 
He sits down. 
VIVIAN He seems like a nice man. 
EDWARD I guess three thousand dollars does not buy loyalty, does it ? 
VIVIAN I just mean it's sweet the way he's crazy about his grandson. 
Two waiters puts down plates in front of Edward and Vivian. 
EDWARD Oh, his grandson thinks he's a relic. He hates that he does, but he does. 
He makes a sign to the waiters who were wondering about the missing guests. 
EDWARD No, just the two. 
THE WAITER (voice over) Yes, sir. 
From her purse, Vivian takes out a little ketchup sealed pack, as found in fast food restaurants, and starts tearing it open. 
Edwards looks at her and smiles. 
Close Up on Vivian's plate, where there are a piece of meat, a cob of corn, a jacket potato sliced in two halves, and some salad. We see Vivian's hand pouring ketchup from the pack on her meat. 
Medium shot on the maitre d'hotel walking toward the waiter and whispering in his ear. The waiter nods his head toward Vivian. 
Close Up on Vivian's plate. She spread the ketchup on her meat with her fork. 
The maitre d'hotel walks away, bobbing his head in a deprecating manner. 
Vivian looks around and senses that something is wrong. 
Edward smiles and looks at the waiter. 
VIVIAN It's ketchup. 
The waiter smiles. 
THE WAITER Yes, sir. 
EDWARD (voice over) Check, please. 
THE WAITER Yes, sir. 
The waiter walks away to get the check.

Vivian walks toward him, still wearing her cocktail dress. 
VIVIAN Edward, you said you never come out here. 
He looks down at the feet of his chair. 
EDWARD Well, I'm only halfway out. 
VIVIAN Didn't say much in the car on the way home. You thinking about dinner ? I was a maniac. 
PENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Medium shot of the terrace seen from the open French window. 
VIVIAN I mean, the business was good, I think. You know ? 
Vivian sits down on the balustrade of the terrace. 
VIVIAN He's in trouble. You want his company. He doesn't want to let it go. 
EDWARD Thanks for the recap. 
VIVIAN The problem is, I think you liked Mr. Morse. 
PENTHOUSE - TERRACE - EXTERIOR NIGHT 
Edward points his finger toward Vivian. 
EDWARD What I would like is for you to get down from there. You're making me very nervous. Please come down. 
VIVIAN It's making you nervous ? What if I just leaned back a little bit like this ? 
She starts leaning back a little. 
VIVIAN Would you... Would you rescue me if I fell ? 
EDWARD Vivian, I'm serious. Come... I'm not looking. 
VIVIAN It's really high. 
She takes her hands off the balustrade, and waves them up in the air. 
VIVIAN Look, no hands, no hands ! Okay, all right. I'm sorry. 
PENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT 
The terrace seen from the open French window.

VIVIAN They were mean to me. 
EDWARD Mean to you ? 
Edward looks very surprised. Vivian nods «Yes». 
RODEO DRIVE - EXTERIOR DAY 
Medium full shot of Edward and Vivian crossing the street, holding hands. Vivian is still wearing her blue very short skirt, but the upper half of her body is covered by a white shirt, knotted at the waist and with the sleeves rolled back on her arms. She is also wearing regular woman's shoes, so she doesn't look like a prostitute any more. 
VIVIAN People are looking at me. 
They now walk on the sidewalk. 
EDWARD They're not looking at you. They're looking at me. 
VIVIAN The stores are not nice to people. I don't like it. 
EDWARD Stores are never nice to people. They're nice to credit cards. 
He stops walking and Vivian also stops. 
EDWARD Okay, stop fidgeting. 
VIVIAN All right. 
EDWARD Get rid of your gum. 
She spits her gum, almost hitting two female pedestrians. One of them jumps up. 
EDWARD I don't believe you did that. 
Edward pulls her by the hand and they enter an expensive clothing store. 
CLOTHING STORE - INTERIOR DAY 
Medium shot of Vivian and Edward standing near a hanging rail full of dresses. Edward is holding Vivian's hand, who seems a little embarrassed. A young well-dressed man approaches them : he is Mr. Hollister, the manager of the store. 
EDWARD Yes ? 
HOLLISTER I am Mr. Hollister, the manager. May I help you ? 
Edward shakes hand with him. 
EDWARD Edward Lewis. 
HOLLISTER Ah, yes, sir. 
EDWARD You see this young lady over here ? 
Vivian joins the two men with a broad smile. 
HOLLISTER Yes. 
EDWARD Do you have anything in this shop as beautiful as she is ? 
Vivian puts her head on Edward's shoulder. 
HOLLISTER Oh, yes. 
Hollister understand he has made a blunder. 
HOLLISTER Oh, no ! No, no, no, I'm saying we have many things as beautiful as she would want them to be. That's the point I was getting at, and I think we can all agree with that. That's why when you came in... Edward takes Hollister's elbow and walks slightly away. 
EDWARD Excuse me. You know what we're gonna need here ? 
HOLLISTER ...we knew from the first... 
EDWARD We're gonna need a few more people helping us. I'll tell you why. We're going to be spending an obscene amount of money in here. So we're going to need a lot more help sucking up to us. That's what we really like. You understand that. 
Vivian smiles behind Edward. 
HOLLISTER Sir, if I may say so, you're in the right store and the right city for that matter. 
Later. Medium shot of Vivian seated in a comfortable armchair with a catalogue on her laps and Hollister kneeling at her side. 
HOLLISTER Anything you see here, we can do, by the way. Get ready to have some fun. Okay ? 
Vivian smiles. 
VIVIAN Okay. 
Hollister makes a sign with his hand. 
Full shot of the store. In the forefront, Edward is standing behind a counter with a cordless telephone in his hand. He dials on the telephone. 
HOLLISTER Mary Pat, Mary Kate, Mary Francis, Tovah, let's see it ! 
He stands up. A saleswoman is running toward Vivian with a dress in her hands. She puts it on Vivian's laps, who puts the catalogue away. 
HOLLISTER Come on. Bring it out, girls. 
THE SALESWOMAN Oh, this is absolutely divine. 
Another saleswoman, also with a dress in her hand, is coming from the other side. 
Medium shot on Edward behind the counter. In the background, we hear female voices, but we don't understand the words. Hollister walks toward Edward. 
HOLLISTER Excuse me, sir, uh, 
EDWARD Yeah ? 
HOLLISTER Exactly how obscene an amount of money were you talking about ? Just profane or really offensive ? 
EDWARD Really offensive. 
HOLLISTER I like him so much ! 
Edward takes the phone to his ear, and Hollister walks away. 
We hear the orchestral music from the title song : «Pretty Woman» Vivian is still seated on her armchair, looking at all the clothes that the saleswomen are bringing to her. 
She has a very bright red dress in her hand and she looks at Edward. 
Edward makes a face and nods «No». 
A saleswoman put a black hat on Vivian's head. 
Edward smiles and nods «Yes». 
Hollister sits down near Vivian and a saleswoman brings a grey dress. Vivian points to the dress and looks at Edward. 
Edward makes a face and a «So-So» sign with his hand. 
Slightly later. 
Edward is standing near the counter, drinking coffee. In the background, we see Vivian surrounded by saleswomen. Hollister walks toward Edward. 
The music stops. 
HOLLISTER Mr. Lewis, sir. Mr. Lewis, how's it going so far ? Pretty well, I think. 
EDWARD I think we need some major sucking up. 
HOLLISTER Very well, sir. You're not only handsome, but a powerful man. I could see the second you walked in here, you were someone to reckon with... 
Edward has put the coffee cup down and has taken the telephone again. He turns toward Hollister. 
EDWARD Hollister. 
HOLLISTER Yes, sir. 
EDWARD Not me. Her. 
He points toward the group of saleswomen surrounding Vivian. 
HOLLISTER I'm sorry, sir. I'm sorry. 
He walks away from Edward and toward the group of saleswomen. 
HOLLISTER How we doing, ladies ?

Medium full shot of Vivian seated on the trunk of a red convertible car. Her hat is on the trunk near her. A man takes one of Vivian's shoes off to clean it. A woman is standing near the car, watching the scene. 
THE MAN No, it's all part of the game of polo. You get to have your shoes polished by a member of the club. 
He looks at a dirty spot on the shoe. 
THE MAN I think I got something in the car that will buff that up. He walks away with the shoe. 
VIVIAN Thank you. 
Medium shot on David Morse walking toward Vivian. He is wearing his polo player outfit : red shirt, with the name of his team «L.A. Gems» and his number in the team «2», and white pants. He is holding his helmet, his leather gloves and his riding crops in one hand. 
DAVID MORSE Vivian, hi. David Morse. 
Medium shot of Vivian, still seated on the car. She smiles. The woman, who was talking with her, walks away. 
THE WOMAN Excuse me. 
Vivian takes her hat, jumps from the car down on the ground, and walks toward David. 
VIVIAN David. 
DAVID MORSE How are you ? 
VIVIAN I'm okay. 
David looks at the hat Vivian is holding 
DAVID MORSE I thought that was you. I like this hat. 
VIVIAN It's new.

DAVID MORSE (voice over) Yeah ? 
VIVIAN (voice over) Yeah ! 
ELIZABETH What are you looking at ? 
PHILIP Edward's date. 
Reverse angle shot on what Philip sees : David and Vivian talking together, seen from a distance. We can't hear what they are saying. 
ELIZABETH (voice over) I'm going for a ride with the Ritter's in their new car. Okay, hon ? 
Back on Philip. Elizabeth gives Philip a kiss on the cheek 
PHILIP Uh-huh. 
Elizabeth understands that Philip has not heard a word of what she just said. 
ELIZABETH Philip, I'm going to rip off all my clothes and do a naked belly dance for the polo players. 
PHILIP Have fun. 
Elizabeth walks away, looking a bit furious. 
Back on Vivian and David, as watched by Philip. They are now standing in front of David's horse, held by a young blonde girl. 
DAVID MORSE Come meet my horse, Vivian. 
VIVIAN Well, Edward's waiting for me. I don't want to... 
DAVID MORSE Come on. He's right here. 
VIVIAN Okay, I'll... Just for a second, though. 
She walks toward the horse, looking back to watch for Edward. 
VIVIAN I didn't know you were playing today. 
Medium shot of Philip and Edward walking between the stands. 
EDWARD Uh... I was asking for directions. There she was. 
PHILIP Oh, so you just ran into her ? That's great, Jesus ! 
PHILIP So anyway, what does she do ? Does she... does she work ? 
They stop walking in front of a stand, where waiters are pouring Champagne for the guests. 
EDWARD She's in sales. 
PHILIP Sales ? That's terrific. That's good. What does she sell ? 
EDWARD Why do you want to know ? 
PHILIP Now just hear me out on this, okay ? I've known you a long time. I... I see some differences in you this week, like the tie, and, uh... I'm wondering if maybe this girl isn't the difference, especially when I see her talking to David Morse.

EDWARD (voice over) I introduced them at dinner the other night. PHILIP (voice over) So what ? Now they're best friends ? 
Back on Edward and Philip talking together. 
PHILIP I mean, this girl appears from out of nowhere. Now she's talking to a guy whose company we're trying to buy. That's a little convenient, don't you think ? 
He walks behind her. 
EDWARD Vivian ! Vivian, I'm speaking to you. Come back here ! 
PENTHOUSE - BEDROOM - INTERIOR EVENING 
Vivian was ready to enter the bathroom, but she turns around. 
EDWARD I hate to point out the obvious, but you are, in fact, a hooker ! And you are my employee ! 
VIVIAN Look, you don't own me. I decide, okay ? I say who. I say when. I... I say who... 
EDWARD I refuse to spend the next three days fighting with you. I said I was sorry. I meant it. That's the end of it ! 
VIVIAN I'm sorry I ever met you. She walks away into the bathroom 
VIVIAN I'm sorry I ever got into your stupid car ! 
He walks toward the bathroom, enters it and starts taking his tie off in front of the mirror. 
EDWARD As if you had so many more appealing options. 
Vivian comes back to the bathroom door, carrying a bunch of clothes. 
VIVIAN I've never had anyone make me feel as cheap as you did today. 
EDWARD Somehow, I find that very hard to believe. She gets out of the bathroom with her arms full of clothes. She picks up a small handbag and puts it on her shoulder. Then she tries to pick up a larger handbag. 
Close shot on the handbag, stuck under an armchair. We notice that Vivian is bare feet. 
Vivian finally succeeds in picking up the bag and put the straps over her shoulder, on top of the smaller bag. Edward walks out of the bathroom and joins her. 
EDWARD Where are you going ? 
VIVIAN I want my money. I want to get out of here. 
She crosses her arms on her bunch of clothes. She has a very sullen, sad face. Edward doesn't move for a couple of seconds, then walks to the bed, to pick up his jacket. He gets his wallet from the inside pocket of his jacket. He opens the wallet, and gets a large wad of banknotes out of it. 
Close up shot on the bed. We see the wad of banknotes falling on the bed. They are all hundred-dollar bills. 
Edward walks away toward the living room, and Vivian remains without moving with her sullen sad face. She looks down at the bed.

Back to Vivian, who hasn't moved. She starts walking away toward the living room, without taking her money. 
PENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR EVENING 
Edward is standing near the desk, looking at his mail. Vivian walks behind him, coming from the bedroom and going away toward the front door. We hear the door opening. Edward looks up toward the door. The door closes, and Edward looks very pensive. He looks back into the bedroom.

EDWARD I'm sorry. I wasn't prepared to answer questions about us. It was stupid and cruel. I didn't mean it. I don't want you to go. Will you stay the week ? 
VIVIAN Why ? 
EDWARD I saw you talking to David Morse. I didn't like it. 
VIVIAN We were just talking. 
He chuckles. 
EDWARD I didn't like it. 
The elevator bell dings. The elevator door opens, and a smiling Dennis appears. 
DENNIS Down ? 
Close shot on Edward's face, and then on Vivian's face. 
Dennis feels some tension between Edward and Vivian and stops smiling. He goes back into the elevator, presses a button and the door closes. 
VIVIAN You hurt me. 
EDWARD Yes. 
VIVIAN Don't do it again. 
They look at each other for a couple of seconds, then slowly, Vivian walks back to the penthouse. Edward follows her and takes one of her handbags from her shoulder. They both enters the penthouse and he closes the door behind him. 
PENTHOUSE - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT 
High angle shot above the bed. Edward and Vivian are lying in the bed, presumably naked, but covered by a sheet from their waist down. They are facing each other and talking. 
VIVIAN First guy I ever loved was a total nothing. Second was worse. My mom called me a bum magnet. If there was a bum within a fifty-mile radius, I was completely attracted to him. That's how I ended up here. I followed bum number three. Slowly, the camera moves closer to them. 
EDWARD Mm. 
VIVIAN So here I was : no money, no friends, no bum. 
EDWARD So then you chose this as your profession ? 
VIVIAN I worked at a couple fast food places, parked cars at wrestling. And I couldn't make the rent. I was too ashamed to go home. That's when I met Kit. She was a hooker and made it sound so great. So one day I did it. 
The camera stops moving forward, having reached a medium close shot, showing Vivian and Edward's heads and shoulders. 
VIVIAN I cried the whole time. But then I got some regulars and, you know... It's not like anybody plans this. It's not your childhood dream. 
EDWARD You could be so much more. 
Close shot on Vivian's face. 
VIVIAN People put you down enough, you start to believe it. 
Reverse shot on Edward's face.

He walks away from the desk. 
THE RECEPTIONIST Yes, sir. 
A blonde female secretary walks into the room, carrying a thick pile of documents. 
PHILIP Where are you going ? Did he sign these ? 
THE SECRETARY No, he said he had to leave. 
Philip walks nervously across the room. 
PHILIP He had to... 
He meets Edward coming out of an office. 
PHILIP Edward, you can't disappear now. We're in this too deep. 
EDWARD Don't panic, Philip. Morse isn't going anywhere. I'll be back here in the morning. 
He stops at the reception desk. 
EDWARD Did you send the tickets to the hotel ? 
THE RECEPTIONIST Yes, sir. 
EDWARD Thank you. 
He starts walking out of the room. 
The third box is empty, but an usher shows Edward and Vivian through the door of the box. 
USHER Right this way, Mr. Lewis, sir. Vivian enters first, followed by Edward. Vivian looks down from the balustrade of the box. Edward shakes hand with Doris, an old lady in the next box. 
EDWARD Doris. 
DORIS Edward, how are you ? 
EDWARD How nice to see you. Nice to see you. 
The camera starts going away and down from the box. 
EDWARD Sir. 
He shakes hands with Doris' husband. 
DORIS' HUSBAND Good evening, Edward. 
EDWARD Wonderful news. Congratulations. 
Meanwhile, Vivian has moved to the corner of the balustrade. 
VIVIAN Hey, come here. You gotta look at this. 
Medium close shot on the box. Edward, who, as we already know it, is afraid of heights, doesn't want to move any closer to the balustrade. 
EDWARD It's all right. I've already seen it. 
VIVIAN If you're afraid of heights, why do you get seats up here ? 
EDWARD Because they're the best. 
He sits down, and Vivian also sits down. The ushers, who had remained behind them, slightly bends down toward Edward. 
USHER Is there anything else, sir ? 
EDWARD No, thank you. 
He shows them something underneath the balustrade, and then moves away. 
USHER The glasses are there. Enjoy the opera. 
VIVIAN Oh ! 
She picks up the opera glasses. 
VIVIAN So, you said this is in Italian. 
She tries to look through the glasses, but doesn't succeed in setting them right on their handle. 
EDWARD Mm-hmmm. 
VIVIAN So how am I gonna know what they're singing. These are broken. 
Edward takes the glasses from Vivian's hand. 
VIVIAN Mine are broken. 
EDWARD No, no. That's okay It's all right. 
He sets them right on their handle, and gives them back to Vivian. 
VIVIAN Oh. 
EDWARD You'll know. Believe me, you'll understand. 
Vivian looks through the glasses, while the lights are switching off and on, to warn the spectators that the opera is about to begin. 
EDWARD The music's very powerful.

VIVIAN There's a band ! 
Medium shot on the two other boxes. The light are definitely switched off, and ushers are closing the curtains on the exit doors. 
Back to Vivian and Edward. We hardly see them in the dark. 
EDWARD People's reactions to opera the first time they see it is very dramatic. They either love it or they hate it. If they love it, they will always love it. If they don't, they may learn to appreciate it, but it will never become part of their soul. 
VIVIAN Mmm. 
The orchestra plays the overture of «La Traviata». 
The lights, coming from the stage, enable us to see Vivian and Edward's faces. Vivian is smiling broadly. Edward is concentrated on the music and serious. 
Close shot on Vivian's face. Still smiling broadly, she turns briefly toward Edward, and then goes back looking at the stage. She bends down on the balustrade to have a better look at the stage. 
SAN FRANCISCO OPERA HOUSE - STAGE - INTERIOR NIGHT

DORIS Did you enjoy the opera, dear ? 
VIVIAN Oh, it was so good, I almost peed in my pants. 
DORIS What ? 
She seems a bit surprised by what she just heard. Vivian walks away, and Edward turns toward Doris. 
EDWARD She said she liked it better than Pirates of Penzance. 
DORIS Oh ! Edward walks away, leaving a very pensive Doris. Apparently she doesn't completely believe Edward's translation of Vivian's words ! 
EDWARD Yes. Good-bye now. 
Still very pensive, Doris absently waves her hand to him.

Among the tough-looking guys around Edward, we recognize Carlos, still wearing his eternal hat, and another guy, one of Carlos' lieutenants, wearing a leather jacket, and holding a long stick in his hands. 
VIVIAN What's going on out here ? 
EDWARD I don't know. You left and all of a sudden I'm in the middle of West Side Story. 
CARLOS I think you owe me some money, baby. 
THE GUY WITH THE STICK Two hundred dollars. 
EDWARD Why don't you go to school tomorrow ? 
A girl, standing behind the group, starts giggling very stupidly. 
CARLOS Now I hear you got yourself a new job ? 
VIVIAN Let's just leave. 
She starts walking away, but Carlos puts himself in her way. 
CARLOS You ain't going no place. 
Edward takes a step forward.

KIT Hey, I was busy. I had a life, you know. Nino got beat up. We had to visit him in the hospital. Rachel got arrested. It was a mess. Anyway, I got the money. 
Kit waves the envelope with the money inside. 
KIT Thank you very much for saving my ass. Now Carlos can get off of it.

Vivian points to a table. 
KIT No, something with shade. 
Vivian points to another table. 
KIT You clean up real nice. You sure don't fit in down on the Boulevard looking like you do, not that you ever did.

KIT Yeah. So, when does he leave ? 
VIVIAN Tomorrow.

VIVIAN Yeah. 
KIT You definitely like him. Well, he's not a bum. He's a rich, classy guy.

KIT Oh, no. Come on. You don't know that. Hey, he asked you, right ? Maybe you guys could, like, um, you know, get a house together. Like, buy some diamonds and a horse. I don't know. 
Vivian laughs. 
KIT Anyway, it could work. It happens. 
VIVIAN When does it happen, Kit ? When does it really happen ? Who does it really work out for ? Did it work out for Skinny Marie or Rachel ? No ! 
KIT Those were very specific cases of crackheads. 
VIVIAN I just wanna know who it works out for. You give me one example of somebody that we know that it happened for. 
KIT Name someone ? 
VIVIAN Yeah, one person that it worked out for. 
KIT You want me to give you a name or something. 
VIVIAN Yeah. I'd like to know.

She walks away from him. 
PHILIP Well, I'll just wait. 
She sits down on the sofa, crosses her legs on the couch and starts writing in a notebook. Behind him, Philip sits down on a stool near the bar. 
VIVIAN Uh, Edward will be back soon. Any minute, he'll be home. 
Medium shot on Philip at the bar. He stands up and slowly walks toward her. The camera follows him. 
PHILIP You know... 
(HE CHUCKLES) ...this is not home. This is, uh, a hotel room. And, uh, you are not... the little woman. 
He sits down on the sofa, next to Vivian. She uncrosses her legs and lets them down on the floor. He puts his glass on the low table, crosses his fingers and snickers. 
PHILIP You're a hooker. Maybe you're a very good hooker, you know ? She puts her notebook on the low table. 
PHILIP Maybe if I do you, then I wouldn't care about losing millions of dollars. Because I have to be very honest with you right now, Vivian. 
He moves slightly closer to her. She seems very tense by the situation. 
PHILIP Right now I really do care. I really do. And right now I am really pissed, you know ? 
He moves his hand toward her bare leg. She glares at him. 
PHILIP Right now I am just freaking out. So maybe if I screw you, huh... 
He puts his hand between her legs. She moves it away. 
PHILIP ...and take you to the opera, then I could be a happy guy, just like Edward. 
He keeps on trying to fondle her, and Vivian keeps on trying to get rid of him. 
VIVIAN Hey, get off me ! 
They start fighting. He stands up. 
PHILIP Hey, hey ! Goddamn it ! 
She bites his hand. 
PHILIP Ow ! 
He slaps her face very hard. She falls down on the floor. 
VIVIAN Ow ! 
He kneels down beside her and grabs her. 
PHILIP Come on ! Come on ! I'll pay for it. 
VIVIAN (SCREAMING) Get off me ! Ow ! Get off me ! 
PHILIP How much is it ? Twenty bucks, thirty bucks ? 
VIVIAN (SCREAMING) Get off me ! Get off me ! 
PHILIP Fifty ? You a fifty dollars whore, Vivian ? 
Edward, who has come silently into the room, grabs him from behind, and forces him to stand up. 
PHILIP What are you doing ? Get off ! 
Quick shot on Vivian slowly getting up from the floor. 
Back on Philip and Edward fighting. 
EDWARD Stop. I don't want to hurt you ! Stop it ! 
PHILIP I don't know how to tell you this. You already did, Edward ! 
Edward pushes him toward the front door, which is still open. 
PHILIP All right, all right. 
EDWARD Out. Out of here. 
Philip falls down on the floor. He slowly stands back up 
PHILIP Look, she's a whore, man. She's a goddamn... Aah ! 
Edward very violently punches him in the face. Philip falls down on the floor. 
Quick shot on Vivian, seated on the sofa. She starts when she sees Edward punching Philip. 
Philip slowly stands up, his hand on his face. Edward looks at his hand, who seems to hurt him after the violent punch he gave to Philip. 
EDWARD Aah ! Damn. Shit. Goddamn ! 
He picks up Philip's briefcase and throws it through the open door. It falls on the floor of the hallway. 
PHILIP I think you broke my nose. 
EDWARD Get out of here. 
PHILIP (SCREAMING) What is wrong with you ? Come on, Edward ! I gave you ten years ! I devoted my whole life to you ! 
She slaps him on the arm and walks away. Barney turns around and looks at her walking away.

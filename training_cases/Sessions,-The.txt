EXT.   BERKELEY, CALIFORNIA.   DAY SUBTITLE Berkeley, California -1981- 
DISSOLVE TO ACTUAL TV NEWS FOOTAGE FROM 1981 
A busy intersection near the UC Berkeley campus. A strange, self-propelled motorized gurney whirrs into view and makes its way over a pedestrian crosswalk. The passenger, MARK O'BRIEN, in his early 30s, is visible only from the neck up. The rest of him is covered by a blanket. He operates the gurney with a mouth control and a set of mirrors positioned around his head. 
NEWS REPORTER (V.O.) Mark O'Brien has been going to UC Berkeley since 1978. That's O'Brien in the motorized gurney heading for class last week. 
The gurney continues along a leafy promenade on the campus. Passers-by just go about their normal business. 
NEWS REPORTER (V.O.) He had polio when he was 6 years old. The disease left his body crippled but his mind remained sharp and alert, and since he wanted to be a writer, Mark O'Brien entered Cal to major in English and learn his trade. 
We hear a voice reciting a verse of poetry as we follow Mark in his contraption. 
MARK (V.O.) Graduation Today I hear the crowd's applause Receive congratulations from my friends Today I ask if I've found a place among the rest I hope you see a man upon this stage Who studied...read..wrote, and passed the test In cap and gown, diploma on my chair 
THE SCENE CHANGES to the interior of a large auditorium. A graduation ceremony is in progress.  Suddenly, everyone in the hall, GRADUATES, their FAMILIES, ACADEMICS and OTHERS, rise to their feet as Mark, in his gurney, buzzes across the stage, a mortar board hung on one of the handles. 1A. 
NEWS REPORTER (V.O.) And so, Mark O'Brien graduates from Cal, one of 250 English majors to receive degrees today. 
The DEAN steps forward, congratulates Mark and places a diploma on his blanket. The gurney makes its way across the rest of the stage to thunderous applause. 
THE SCENE CHANGES BACK to the campus exterior. The news reporter talks to camera. 
NEWS REPORTER If this report tells us anything, it is that a disability is not necessarily a handicap. 
In the background, Mark's family and friends are gathered round him in a jubilant mood. 
NEWS REPORTER (CONT'D) Mark O'Brien teaches us that courage and perseverance overcome obstacles. With Mark O'Brien at UC Berkeley, Bill Hillman, Channel Five Eyewitness News.

1A   EXT. SAN FRANCISCO. NIGHT                                    1A 
Classic shot of the illuminated Golden Gate Bridge. 
SUPER CAPTION: "A FEW YEARS LATER" EXT.   STREET OUTSIDE MARK'S.    NIGHT It is about 4.00 a.m. All is quiet. We follow a mean-looking alley cat to the front of a modest, ground-floor apartment. It pauses, then slinks round the side, onto a ledge and in through a partially-opened window. 
INT.    MARK'S PLACE.    NIGHT The cat comes through the window, hops onto the floor and quickly finds a nice little plate of food scraps that has been set out specially. As it settles down to its meal, we become aware of a heavy and regular sound, like a ship's pump, coming from somewhere close-by. 
In the center of the room is an object that looks like a prop from a `50s sci-fi movie. A human head protrudes from one end. The object is an iron lung, and its purpose is to keep its occupant, Mark O'Brien, breathing. Every 4.5 seconds, the pump mechanism creates a vacuum inside, forcing Mark's chest to expand and suck in air. He is fast asleep. 2A. 
MARK (V.O.) Breathing Look you This most excellent canopy, the air, Presses down upon me At 15 pounds per square inch A dense, heavy, blue-glowing ocean. Teasing me with its nearness and immensity. And all I get is a thin stream of it. A finger's width of the rope that ties me to life. 
Having now eaten its fill, the cat has a good scratch, then wanders over to the iron lung. 
It hops up onto the small platform that supports Mark's head and slides itself along his face, once this way, once the other way, then jumps on top of the iron lung and walks its length. Through the portholes, we just make out the shape of Mark's bent, undersize body.  Suddenly, Mark's nose twitches. He opens his eyes and grimaces. 
MARK Shit! 
May the spirit of the Lord be amongst you and remain with you always. 
Mass is over. PEOPLE come up to Mark and place a hand on his head or chest and say, "God bless you." In the background we can also hear Father Brendan. 
FATHER BRENDAN (V.O.) (CONT'D) May the peace of the Lord be with you. 
PARISHIONERS And also with you. 
A LITTLE LATER 5A. 
7A   INT. SIDE CHAPEL. DAY                                     7A 
Mark waits alone in a tiny chapel off to the side of the church. He turns his head, takes a suck on the mouthpiece of his portable respirator, then looks around at the impressive stained glass windows. The expression on Mark's face is that of a true believer. 
MARK (V.O.) I'm definitely a true believer. But I believe in a God with a sense of humor. A wicked sense of humor. One who created me in His own image. 
Father Brendan enters. There is an awkward short moment when he realizes that there is no point in offering to shake hands. For no good reason, he nods instead. 
FATHER BRENDAN Hello. I'm Father Brendan. I don't think we've met. 
MARK No, we haven't. I'm Mark O'Brien. I knew Father Seamus very well. I'm sorry that he's not here any more. 
FATHER BRENDAN As are many others. I'm going to do my best to fill his shoes. I understand you'd like me to hear your confession. 
MARK Yes, I would. By the way, I enjoyed Mass. I liked your tone. 
Father Brendan is not sure how to take this. 
FATHER BRENDAN Thank you. 
MARK You don't believe absolute privacy is an essential part of the confessional, do you? 
FATHER BRENDAN No, I do not. I believe sincerity is the most essential part. 
MARK I told my attendant to come back in half an hour. Is that okay? 
FATHER BRENDAN Yes, take your time. I'm in no rush. 
MARK Did Father Seamus say anything to you about me? FATHER BRENDAN No one said anything to me about you. 
MARK I can be a bit time consuming, but I'm worth the trouble. 
Father Brendan breaks a smile for the first time. FATHER BRENDAN I'm here for you Mark. 
MARK Look, this is not exactly a confession. I haven't yet done the deed. I was hoping to sort of get a quote in advance. 
Father Brendan sits down. 
FATHER BRENDAN Tell me what's on your mind. 
MARK The most immediate thing on my mind would be my attendant, Joan. I'm thinking of getting rid of her. It's an evil thought, but I can't help it. 
FATHER BRENDAN Is she dishonest, or incompetent? 
MARK No, neither of those. She looks at me the wrong way. It's that you- need-me-more-than-I-need-you look. I'd like to show her she's wrong, just for the evil satisfaction it will give me. Is that a sin, Father? 
FATHER BRENDAN Well, it obviously troubles you. 
MARK Yes, it troubles me a lot. Because maybe it's really a power trip. Me against her. Me against the world. 
SANDY (V.O.) No particular reason. If you're working on something else, then we can talk about it later. 
MARK No, now is fine. 
EXT. CARMEN'S DRIVEWAY.      DAY Vera wheels Mark towards his first interview. The more we see Vera, the more we like her. 
MARK (V.O.) There was no denying it. A door had opened which I could not close, and in invisible writing it said: "Do not enter". 
INT.   CARMEN'S PLACE.    DAY We see the slowly rotating reels of a portable cassette recorder. We hear a female voice. 
CARMEN (V.O.) Some positions, like that one, are pretty much impossible. 
Carmen, early 30s, is a paraplegic in a wheelchair. She is pretty and animated, and has full use of her hands. 
CARMEN I don't know if you can quite visualize it. It's called a lateral, or sideways reverse cow- girl. 
It is obvious that Mark cannot visualize it. Although she doesn't give much away, we sense that Vera can. 14A. 
CARMEN (CONT'D) Don't worry about it then. It's just a question of depth of penetration. (MORE) 
CARMEN (CONT'D) To some people it's really important, like my partner, for example. It's not such a big deal for me. I get just as excited when he licks my nipples, if and when he bothers to do it. 
Mark looks troubled. 
CARMEN (CONT'D) I think the tape's about to run out. 
At that very moment, there is a click, and the tape runs out. Vera flips the tape over, sets it running in record mode, and takes her place again behind Mark's gurney. 
CARMEN (CONT'D) Do you want to keep going? 
MARK Uh, I think I've actually got enough to work on. Thanks. 
CARMEN Get back to me if you need anything else. Oh, and let me give you Greg's phone number. He's full of stuff you wouldn't think was possible. 
INT.   MARK'S PLACE.     DAY Rod vacuums the floor while Mark taps away on his typewriter. Mark looks troubled. 
23A   EXT. GREG'S PLACE. DAY                                      23A 
We hear voices. 
MARK (V.O.) Okay, shall we start? 
GREG (V.O.) Sure. 
We hear the cassette recorder click on. 
23B   INT. GREG'S PLACE. DAY                                      23B 
Greg is a handsome quadriplegic. Vera is there with Mark. 
GREG Oral sex is a matter of taste. 
Mark doesn't get it. Vera, as usual, is impassive. 
GREG (CONT'D) And one thing that really works in my favor is that I smoke so much weed that my taste buds are pretty jaded. This gives me a great deal of stamina in the tongue department, and stamina is key in cunnilingus. INT.    MARK'S PLACE.    NIGHT The alley cat creeps in through the open window. Mark watches it approach from his iron lung. 
MARK Who are these people? I feel like an anthropologist interviewing a tribe of headhunters. 
The cat seems to understand. 
LAURA Did you ever discuss sex with your parents? 
MARK No. That would have been unthinkable. 
LAURA Why? 
MARK That's the way they saw the world. It wasn't just that polite people didn't think about sex. No-one did. It was never discussed. As far as they were concerned, there was nothing down there. 
Laura listens. She is pretty in a dark, angular way. A phone on her desk rings. 
LAURA Sorry about that. 
She walks over to it, pushes a button, then comes back. She has a noticeable limp. 
MARK What's that from? 
LAURA Cerebral palsy. 
MARK You'd hardly notice. 
LAURA People notice. It's not easy, the whole thing, attracting a guy, dating, sex, all very problematic. 
MARK I find that hard to believe in your case. 
LAURA Well, you better believe it. 
MARK So, what sort of chance do you give me? 
LAURA Of achieving your romantic fantasy? Very small to minute. 
MARK Look, there's no need to pull any punches. You can be as direct as you like with me. 
She smiles. 
LAURA Mark, I'm just a humble sex therapist. I try to help people with sex problems that can be addressed. Your problem, I understand, is that you have never had sex. 
MARK That's correct. 
LAURA Would I be correct in assuming you're unable to masturbate? 
MARK Correct. 
LAURA Has anyone done it for you? 
MARK No. 
LAURA Have you ever asked anyone? 
MARK Not specifically. I asked someone to marry me. She declined. Does that come close to masturbation? 
LAURA You know, being with the person you love is not the only way of expressing yourself sexually. There are people called sex surrogates. 
MARK Oh? 
LAURA Psychotherapists and psychiatrists are not allowed to have sex with their clients, even if it seems like a good idea. Sex surrogates don't have that limitation. 
MARK Would this be covered by my medical benefits? 
LAURA Unfortunately, no. You'd have to pay the full fee, whatever that was. 
Father Brendan shakes his head with concern. 
FATHER BRENDAN What is the difference between this sexual specialist and a common prostitute? MARK I don't know, but I think there's a difference. 23A. 
FATHER BRENDAN How do you know she's not some hooker gussied up as a social worker, who's just going to rob you? MARK I trust what my therapist said about her. FATHER BRENDAN How old are you? 
MARK Thirty-eight. 
FATHER BRENDAN Why exactly now? 
MARK I never had any spare cash before. That's a major factor, and I'm probably getting close to my use-by date. 
FATHER BRENDAN And this is what you want my advice about? Fornication? 
MARK Your advice as a friend. 
FATHER BRENDAN And do I have the casting vote, so to speak? 
MARK Let's say I value your advice just as much as I do the therapist's. 
FATHER BRENDAN You're serious, aren't you? 
MARK I think sex is a serious matter. It's one of the most persistent themes in the bible. (MORE) 
MARK (CONT'D) So, is it possible for me to know a woman, in the biblical sense, and do I want to find out? 
FATHER BRENDAN And you want my opinion? 
MARK Please. 
Father Brendan contemplates for a few moments. He looks up at the statue of Jesus, then makes a decision. 
FATHER BRENDAN I know in my heart that He'll give you a free pass on this one. Go for it. 
MARK What? FATHER BRENDAN I said, go for it. MARK Really? 
FATHER BRENDAN If you feel up to it. Do you feel up to it? 
MARK To tell the truth, I'm scared. 
FATHER BRENDAN Then we should pray. 
Father Brendan and Mark pray together. 
FATHER BRENDAN (CONT'D) Sweet Jesus, Mark and I sit at your feet and pray that You bless this little journey, this one small step for a man.

37A   OMITTED                                           37A EXT.   STREET NEAR CARMEN'S.   DAY ROD is wheeling Mark along in his gurney. 
MARK I really feel proud of myself, imposing on someone I hardly know, to fornicate in their home. 
ROD Get over it. It's perfectly normal. 
Suddenly, Cheryl notices that Tony has opened the refrigerator and is drinking straight out of the orange juice bottle. 
CHERYL Hold on a moment, please. 
She covers the mouthpiece of the phone. 
CHERYL (CONT'D) Hey, cut that out! 
He takes no notice. She puts the phone down and moves towards him. He closes the fridge door and runs. 
INT.   MARK'S PLACE.    DAY Mark is having a bed bath. His shoulders and neck are covered with soap suds. Rod is washing his back. The phone rings. 
MARK Would you get it please? 
ROD Sure. 
Rod eases Mark back onto the rubber mattress and goes to answer the phone. 
ROD (CONT'D) Hullo, Mark O'Brien's phone. 
He switches it to speaker so Mark can hear. 
CHERYL (V.O.) Hi, this is Cheryl Cohen-Greene. May I speak to Mark? 
Rod holds the phone toward Mark like a question. Mark's face looks drained of blood. 
ROD Just one moment, please. 
Rod switches the phone off speaker. 
ROD (CONT'D) What am I doing here? Yes or no? Make up your mind. 
Mark hesitates, then nods weakly. Rod puts the phone back on speaker. 
MARK Hullo, this is Mark. 
CHERYL (V.O.) Hi, Mark. I'm Cheryl. Laura called to introduce you. I understand you'd like to meet. Is that right? 
Mark can hardly speak. He eventually forces the sound from his throat. 
MARK Uh, yes. 
CHERYL (V.O.) I could see you on the seventeenth, at eleven o'clock. Would that be any good for you? 
MARK Uh, yes, I think that would be fine for me. 
CHERYL Hey, where you from? 
MARK Boston. You? 
CHERYL Salem. Small world. 
MARK Wouldn't want to paint it. INT.   CHERYL'S KITCHEN.     DAY Cheryl is on the phone, holding the receiver with one hand while she puts away groceries with the other. 29A. 
CHERYL We'll be talking for a while to begin with. Then, if you agree, we can also start doing some body awareness exercises in your first session. 
INT.   MARK'S PLACE.   NIGHT The iron lung pumps away. Mark is alone. He stares at the picture of the Virgin Mary. 
MARK Holy Mother of God, what are "body awareness exercises"? 
CHERYL Hi, I'm Cheryl. I'm sorry I'm late. 
VERA No, that's fine. Come in. I'm Vera, I'm one of Mark's helpers. 
Cheryl sees Mark. There is no noticeable reaction in her face, just a smile. 
CHERYL Hi, Mark O'Brien. 
Mark clears his throat with a little difficulty. 
MARK Hi, Cheryl Cohen Greene. 
Vera is already at the front door. 
VERA I'll be back, say, in two hours? 
CHERYL Yes, two hours, that would be perfect. 
She closes the door behind her. Mark feels totally abandoned. 
CHERYL (CONT'D) So... 
Mark blurts out. 
MARK Your money's on the dresser. 
Cheryl walks over to the dresser. When her back is turned, Mark screws up his face in self-disgust. She finds an envelope. 
CHERYL Thank you. 
She puts it in her bag. Mark eyes her carefully. 
MARK That was the wrong way to start off. 
CHERYL Yes, it was. Shall we start again? 
MARK Please, you start. 
She sits down on the bed and looks at him. It is a very frank stare. She is trying to take a lot in. 
CHERYL Although the aim is for us to have sex, I'm not a prostitute and you don't need to pay me up front. I've nothing against prostitutes, but there's a difference. We can talk about that later. 
MARK I'm sorry. 
CHERYL The other thing is, there is a limit to the number of sessions we can have together. Did Laura mention that when you saw her? 
MARK I'm sorry, I don't remember. 
CHERYL The limit is six. But that gives us plenty of opportunity to explore. Now, I understand you are able to have an erection. 
MARK Yes, but not out of choice. 
CHERYL Do you know how many men there are on this planet who would give anything for a natural erection? 
She looks around the room. 
CHERYL (CONT'D) Is this your place? 
MARK No, it's a friend's. The only bedroom furniture I have at my place is an iron lung. I've sometimes thought about buying a futon, in case the need arose. 
CHERYL Okay, okay, I've got it. Don't worry. 
She carefully frees his fingers and eases the sleeve off. 
MARK Be careful, please. 
CHERYL Mark, I'm going to be really careful with you. I don't want to hurt or injure you in any way, but it's really not sexy when you yell at me. Okay? 
MARK I won't yell at you any more. 
CHERYL But you'll tell me calmly the moment anything starts to hurt? MARK Yes. CHERYL Now, let's do the other arm. 
Little by little, she extracts the other arm. He grimaces his way through it, but more in fear than in pain. She finally sets his shirt down on the end of the bed. 
CHERYL (CONT'D) Nice shirt. 
MARK You already said that. 
CHERYL Did I? I guess I'm a little anxious, too. 
She undoes the top of his pants. 
CHERYL (CONT'D) Okay, I'm going to slide these down. Hold your breath. 
She pulls. He screams, in fear more than pain. 
MARK Shit, fuck! No, don't do that! 36A. 
INT.   BATHROOM.   DAY Cheryl sits down on the edge of the tub and takes a couple of deep breaths. 
INT.   CARMEN'S PLACE.   DAY Mark, his body now under the sheets, looks towards the bathroom door. He can hear the sound of water running. He looks at a wall clock and notes the passing of time. 
INT.   BATHROOM. DAY Cheryl turns off the tap. She has done a great job of pulling herself together, and is wrapped in a kimono, which she has brought herself. 
INT.   CARMEN'S PLACE.   DAY Cheryl emerges from the bathroom and starts to undress. 
CHERYL Ready? 
MARK No. 
Cheryl continues undressing, Mark looks away. 
CHERYL Okay, the difference between me and a prostitute is that I don't want your return business. I'm here to help you communicate about your sexual feelings, so you can share them with a future partner. 
She stands there for a few moments, but he keeps his eyes averted. She turns back the sheets, gets into bed beside him and he finally looks at her. 
MARK Whenever I'm naked, everyone else in the room is usually dressed. Now that I'm in bed with another naked person, I'm very confused. 
She strokes his hair. 
CHERYL So, why is it confusing? 
MARK I'd always expected that God, or my parents, would intervene to keep this moment from happening. 
She slides her hand down. She can feel his heart thumping. 37A. 
CHERYL Mark, close your eyes and focus on your sense of touch. 
He closes his eyes. 
CHERYL (CONT'D) Were you afraid at the thought of seeing me? 
MARK I was terrified. 
CHERYL You can be proud of yourself. You did great. We've made real progress. 
MARK Can I ask you something? 
CHERYL Of course. What would you like to ask? 
MARK Anything, really. Tell me something about yourself. Anything. 
CHERYL Sure. I'm a very private person. I have a private life, I do need you to be aware of that, but that's about it. This therapy is about you. 
There is a discreet knock at the front door and then a key turns in the lock. A few moments later, Carmen and Vera come in. 
MARK Welcome back. 
CHERYL Perfect timing. 
CARMEN I hope you guys kept the noise down. 
EXT.   STREET NEAR CARMEN'S.   DAY Vera wheels Mark back the way they came. She is very discreet and they travel in silence for a while. Finally, curiosity overcomes her. 
VERA How do you feel? 
MARK Cleansed and victorious. 
VERA Doesn't get any better than that. 
MARK Tell me about your first sexual experience. 
VERA Let me think. It wasn't all that pleasant. I mean, it was consensual and everything, and I really was in love with the guy, but his dick seemed enormous to me, I didn't think it would fit. It was scary. But he was nice. I guess he couldn't help it. 
MARK Was he Chinese? 
VERA Are you kidding? I only hung out with white guys at high school. 
MARK Why is that? 
VERA I don't know. To stick it to my mum and dad, I suppose. 
MARK Are they happy now you've got a Chinese boyfriend? 
VERA They're happy. I'm happy. 
MARK What's his dick like? 
VERA Perfect size. 
MARK Why do you call it a dick instead of a penis? 
VERA Penis sounds like some vegetable you don't want to eat. Dick sounds like what it is. 
They continue in silence for a little while. 
MARK The thing is, it was all over so damn quickly. 
VERA Yes, tell me about it. 
She pulls back the bed covers and gets into bed with Mark. 
CHERYL (CONT'D) You're going to start to understand the signals from your body... 
Their bodies touch. He looks blissful. 
CHERYL (CONT'D) ...and learn how to control... Then suddenly... 43A. 
MARK Oh God! Oh God! 
Mark's expression of bliss turns to one of anger and frustration. 
MARK (CONT'D) Damn! Shit! 
INT. SIDE CHAPEL.   DAY Mark is in the side chapel with Father Brendan. 
MARK I did it again. This time, I ejaculated on her thigh. 
Father Brendan winces. 
MARK (CONT'D) I felt cursed, that the whole enterprise was cursed. It seemed like a totally just punishment. God wasn't actually denying my sexuality. He was merely pointing out to me how useless it was. 
FATHER BRENDAN It's amazing to me how often God is brought into the sex act. I understand that even amongst non- believers, the most common expression of sexual ecstasy is "Oh, God!" 
70   OMITTED                                                      70 
71   OMITTED                                                      71 INT.   CARMEN'S PLACE.    DAY Cheryl returns from the bathroom and slides back into bed. 
CHERYL Okay, I don't want to hear any more about God cursing you. I want the credit. It was my overpowering beauty that did it. It took you by surprise. Now, where were we? 
MARK What do you mean, where were we? 
CHERYL I'm going to touch you... I'm touching you... and when we both feel you're aroused, then I'm going to guide you into my vagina. 
MARK Is there anything I need to do? 
CHERYL Close your eyes, feel your body, that's all you need to do. 
Mark closes his eyes. In his mind's eye, he sees the saintly figures in the beautiful stained glass windows of the church with the afternoon sun blazing through. An equally saintly, but naked Amanda floats towards him, her arms beckoning. 
When he opens his eyes, Cheryl is straddling him, but in a Leaning Tower of Pisa sort of way. It is a struggle for her, but somehow she is managing to get Mark into a workable position for intercourse. Suddenly, he panics. 
MARK It won't fit. It's not going to fit. 
CHERYL No, Mark, it will fit just fine. 
MARK No, it's dangerous. It's too big. 
CHERYL It's not too big. Relax. 
MARK It won't fit. It'll hurt. It's too risky. 
CHERYL Please, stop this. I promise you, nothing bad will happen. Now, let's try again while you're still hard. 
She attempts to guide him in again. Mark grimaces, makes a strange noise. We realize that he has just ejaculated again involuntarily. 
MARK Shit! 
INT.   BATHROOM.   DAY Cheryl steps out of the shower. 
CHERYL Mark, I'm just going to go the bathroom for a quick pee. When I come back, we're going to achieve full penetration. But before I go, I want you to close your eyes. 
MARK Is this a game? 
CHERYL No, it's not a game. Just do as I say. Close your eyes. 
He closes his eyes. 
CHERYL (CONT'D) Picture yourself as a six year old boy at the beach. Can you do that? 
MARK Yes, very easily. 
EXT.   BEACH.   DAY The scene has a hazy, dreamlike reality. We see the six-year old Mark, able-bodied and full of energy, running and playing in the sand with his dog. 
INT.   MOTEL ROOM.    DAY CHERYL Describe some of your feelings. 
MARK I feel very exhilarated, running next to the Atlantic Ocean, feeling the wind and the wet sand between my toes. 
CHERYL Do you really feel like him? 
MARK Yes, I really feel like him. 
CHERYL But can you really picture him? 
MARK I don't understand what you mean. I said I can feel like him. Of course I can picture him. 
CHERYL From the outside, I mean, as an adult, as you are now, looking at him with his crew cut and his little face? 
MARK Yes. 
CHERYL And are you mad at him? Do you blame him for getting polio? Was it his fault? 53A. 
Cheryl gets up and goes to the bathroom. Mark is obviously affected by her question. 
INT.   SIDE CHAPEL.    DAY Mark has a faraway look. 
MARK She either forgot to close the bathroom door, or didn't bother to close it. 
Mark pauses as he hears some distant footsteps. Father Brendan looks over his shoulder. They finally pass. Mark continues. 
MARK (CONT'D) I found the sound of her peeing incredibly erotic, and the sound of her tearing off toilet paper incredibly intimate. By the time she came back I had a terrific boner. 
INT.   MOTEL ROOM.    DAY Cheryl gets herself into position on top of Mark. 
CHERYL I'm going to rub the tip of your cock around my vulva. When it's ready, I'll guide you in. Breathe slowly and think of something delicious. 
Mark thinks. Through his mind's eye, we see a succession of images. Fingertips stroking a cat's fur. In the background, the sound of tom-toms. A tribal initiation rite. Drums, dancing, trances. Then Ravel's "Bolero". Clint Eastwood saying "make my day". Suddenly, and with a big yell, Mark comes. 
MARK Aahh! 
INT.   MOTEL RECEPTION.      DAY Vera is still there, reading her book. The clerk looks at his watch. 
CLERK They've been in there a long time. 
VERA Yes, some people can do that. 
He does not get it. 
CLERK Do you want another coffee? 
She gets up and starts to get dressed. 
CHERYL (CONT'D) Hey, we did really good stuff today. You were fantastic. You're a fully fledged male homo sapiens endowed with a handsome and substantial penis which now has a proven track record. You should be pleased. 
MARK Was I really inside you? 
CHERYL You were really and truly inside me. 
MARK For how long? 
CHERYL Five or six seconds. 
MARK Is that all? 
CHERYL That's a long time for some people. You were pretty excited. I don't know what you were thinking about. 
MARK I'm sorry, I couldn't tell one thing from another. It was all a jumble of sensations. 
CHERYL Well, you definitely achieved penetration. It was penis-vagina all the way. And you definitely get an A for orgasm. 
She is ready to go. She comes over to Mark and kisses him on the cheek. 
MARK Did you come? 
CHERYL No, Mark, I didn't. 
MARK Can we try for that next time? 
She hesitates for a moment. 
CHERYL If that's what you want. 
MARK Yes, that's what I want. 
CHERYL Okay then. 
INT.   LAURA'S OFFICE.    DAY Laura is on the phone to Cheryl. 
LAURA How's it going? 
INT.   CHERYL'S PLACE.    DAY Cheryl is at her desk. 
CHERYL He reads too many books. He has it in his head that after meeting three times, we should be able to have penetrative sex which results in simultaneous orgasm. Boom! Just like that. 
INT.   LAURA'S OFFICE.    DAY LAURA That's very funny. 
INT.   CHERYL'S PLACE.    DAY CHERYL I guess. Yes, it is. 
LAURA (V.O.) What do you think of him? 
Cheryl thinks. 
INT.   LAURA'S OFFICE.    DAY LAURA I said, what do you think of him? 
CHERYL (V.O.) I like him. 
EXT. STREET OUTSIDE MARK'S PLACE. NIGHT Father Brendan approaches and arrives at the front door. He rings. Rod lets him in. 
INT.    MARK'S PLACE.    NIGHT Mark is in his iron lung. Father Brendan, wearing civilian clothes, comes in with a 6 pack of beer. 
She puts it back in the envelope and walks back inside the house. She is visibly affected. 
120   OMITTED                                                     120 
121   OMITTED                                                     121 EXT.   STREET OUTSIDE MARK'S PLACE.   DAY From behind, we see Vera wheeling Mark in his gurney. ANOTHER FEMALE FIGURE creeps up beside Vera and whispers in her ear, all unbeknownst to Mark. The other female figure takes over from Vera, who trails along, a few feet behind. Mark remains unaware. He has a new and different-looking shirt, even more out there than the previous one? 
MARK Do you think she'll like the shirt? 
AMANDA I like it. Does that count? 
Mark can barely believe it. 
MARK Amanda? 
EXT.   PARK.   DAY They are stopped at a park bench. Vera is hovering in the background, out of earshot. 
MARK It's been a while. 
AMANDA I know. I'm sorry. I'm going to Germany. I wanted to say goodbye to you before I left. 
MARK Why are you going to Germany? 
AMANDA To study German. 
MARK For how long? 
AMANDA One or two years maybe. But we should keep in touch. 
MARK But why go to Germany? It's the only place in the world where humor is actually forbidden. 
She laughs, then smiles quietly, then touches him. 
AMANDA You could always make me laugh. I love you, Mark. I really do. 
Mark's face is a picture of anguish and confusion. 
MARK Really? 
INT. SIDE CHAPEL.     DAY MARK Yes, I love you, but not in that way. I love you, but I'm not in love with you. Blah, blah, blah. You know how it goes. 
Mark lets out a deep, meaningful sigh. For a time, he and Father Brendan maintain a respectful silence. 
EXT.   PARK.   DAY AMANDA I think it's great what you're doing with this surrogate lady. 
She leans over and kisses Mark on the lips. 
MARK It could have been you. 
AMANDA It could have been, but it wasn't. 
INT.   SIDE CHAPEL.    DAY MARK I had this faint hope that she would show the merest hint of jealousy. It shows you how naïve I am. (MORE) 
MARK (CONT'D) The fact that I was no longer a virgin, that I was a `made man', so to speak, made no difference to her at all. 
EXT.   MOTEL.    DAY Cheryl's car is in the parking lot. We see her draw the blinds. 
INT.   MOTEL RECEPTION.    DAY Clerk takes two beers from a mini-bar and hands one to Vera. 
VERA Thanks. 
MARK Then afterwards, there was this moment, this glimpse of an awful sadness to come. 
Father Brendan closes his eyes and nods knowingly. 
135   OMITTED                                                  135 
136   OMITTED                                                  136 
EXT.   CHERYL'S PLACE.   NIGHT The Volvo is parked out front. The envelope is still on the dash. 
INT.   CHERYL'S PLACE.      NIGHT Cheryl is dictating. 
CHERYL Mark achieved an erection as soon as I started to suck on him. He did the controlled breathing, as I had suggested, and I was able to get on top and guide him in quite easily. 
INT.   MOTEL ROOM.   DAY We see Mark's face from Cheryl's POV. His eyes are still closed. 
MARK Is it in? Is it really in? 
CHERYL Yes, it's really in. 
We hear Mark's thoughts. 
MARK (V.0.) I couldn't believe it. 
We hear the sound of typing. 
INT.    MARK'S PLACE.      DAY Mark is in his iron lung, typing. At the top of the page, we can see the title of the piece: 
"On Seeing a Sex Surrogate" Page 8. 
MARK (V.O.) I was finally there. Too soon, I came. But she kept holding me inside her. Then a look of pleasure brushed lightly over her face... 
INT.   MOTEL ROOM.   DAY We see Cheryl's face from Mark's POV. It is as beatific as we have ever seen it. 
MARK (V.O.) ... as though an all-day itch were finally being scratched. Letting me go, she put her hands down on the bed by my shoulders and kissed my chest. This act of affection moved me deeply. 
Cheryl's actions follow Mark's description. 
INT.   SIDE CHAPEL.    DAY Mark is with Father Brendan. 
MARK I almost wept. No-one had ever kissed me there before. It was so unexpected and so natural. 
INT.   MOTEL ROOM.    DAY Cheryl's lips move away from Mark's chest. She kisses him on the lips, light and lingering. As soon as there is enough space between them, he whispers to her. 
MARK I love you. 
She whispers back. 
CHERYL I love you, too. 
MARK Did you come? 
CHERYL Yes. 
INT.   CHERYL'S PLACE.       NIGHT Cheryl continues dictating. 
CHERYL Mark is breathing well and learning to pace himself. There is no real physical impediment to a variety of sexual activities, given the right sort of partner. His deeper emotional needs are outside the scope of my potential involvement. 
Cheryl pauses, then goes on. 
MARK Or, what? 
CHERYL Or, we could stop now. 
MARK You mean, make this the last session? 
CHERYL Yes. 
There is a pregnant pause. 
MARK What do you think we should do? 
CHERYL It's not we, it's you, Mark. It's up to you. 
MARK I want to know how you feel. 
CHERYL That doesn't come in to it. 
MARK Yes, it does. I don't just write poems to anyone. 
CHERYL Mark, what do you want me to say? How much I was touched by that? How special this has been to me? Is that going to help you? No, it's going to make things worse. 
MARK You mean to say, come the sixth session that will be it? 
CHERYL Yes, that will be it. I explained that the first time we met. 
Mark has a serious and painful moment. 
CHERYL (CONT'D) I'm sorry. If it's any consolation, it's also hard for me to think about it. 
MARK Then maybe we should pull the plug now. 
CHERYL I think maybe we should. It's only going to get harder. I guess you might as well save the money. Maybe buy yourself a nice futon. 
A LITTLE LATER. 
Cheryl is getting dressed. Mark watches pensively. She pauses and looks at him. He keeps a brave face. There is a knock on the door. 
CHERYL (CONT'D) Just a moment. 
She and Mark make eye contact for the last time. They manage to smile at each other. 
MARK (V.O.) I desperately wanted to feel that because of Cheryl, my life had changed. But it hadn't. 
Apart from her usual things, she is also carrying a long mirror. 
CHERYL Bye, Mark 
MARK (V.O.) Bye. 
As Cheryl goes out, Vera comes in. 
VERA Everything all right? 
CHERYL He did great. See you. I'm sorry, I have to run. 
VERA See you. 
Vera walks in and closes the door behind her. 
CHERYL I don't think you'd understand. 
MIKVAH LADY You can try me. 
CHERYL Okay. I'm a housewife. 
MIKVAH LADY Why shouldn't I understand? 
CHERYL I guess I was mistaken. 
Cheryl steps towards the pool. 
MIKVAH LADY I see you're very comfortable with being naked. 
She takes hold of the rail and puts her foot in the water. 
CHERYL That has never been one of my problems. 
MIKVAH LADY Sometimes new brides come with their mothers. Do I have to take this off? Can I please leave this on? They've never been naked before. No honey, it all has to come off. 
CHERYL And it does? 
Cheryl takes another step into the water. 
MIKVAH LADY And it does. They stand on the edge of that pool without anything to cling to but themselves. Nothing to hide behind. This is your body. This is the body that God crafted for you. 
Cheryl immerses herself up to her chest. 
MIKVAH LADY (CONT'D) Immerse completely. Go completely under the water, without touching the walls or anything. 
She immerses completely. We see her under the water. She hears a voice in the distance, her own voice. At the same time, there is a look of elation in her eyes. 
CHERYL (V.O.) Okay Mark, you can open your eyes now. 
INT.   MOTEL ROOM.   DAY Mark is on the bed alone. He opens his eyes. 
CHERYL (V.O.) This is your body. 
A few feet in front of Mark, Cheryl is holding a full-length mirror. The angle is such that he can see all of himself. He is mesmerized by his own image. Flashes of light from the mirror flicker over his face. 
MARK (V.O.) So this is the body that someone was able to love. Not quite as bad as I thought. 
INT.   HOSPITAL CORRIDOR.   DAY Overhead fluorescent lights flash by, as we observe the ceiling from Mark's point of view. We also hear the sound of rapidly rolling rubber wheels, and a voice. 
VOICE Mark, can you hear me? Open your eyes. 
INT.   HOSPITAL.   DAY Mark is in a regular hospital bed, with a temporary plastic cocoon over him in place of his iron lung. There is a volunteer called SUSAN in the room with him. 
SUSAN They'll be letting you go today. Whoever looks after you will leave the portable respirator switched on at night, fully charged, so you'll have at least one back-up system. 
MARK How close was I? 
SUSAN To what? 
MARK You know, to that tunnel thing and the light, and the voice saying don't go near the light. 
SUSAN Is that what you remember? 
MARK No. I assume I passed out. Before that, I remember feeling sorry for myself. 
MARK The best. 
AMBULANCE OFFICER Good to be alive, huh? 
EXT. HOSPITAL.      DAY We see the disappearing figure of Susan from the point of view of the departing ambulance. 
MARK (V.O.) I met Susan five years before I died. She was the love of my life. We had the same priorities, baseball pretty much came first, and we wrote each other mushy poems. I never expected it, nor did she, but that's often the way things turn out. 
INT.   MARK'S PLACE.        DAY Rod shows Father Brendan into Mark's room. 
Father Brendan sits in a chair next to Mark's iron lung. 
FATHER BRENDAN That was quite something. What do you propose to do for an encore? 
MARK Yep, I almost found out the big secret. But here I am, back with the living. If there is another place, then I think they took one look at me and decided to throw me back. 
FATHER BRENDAN And welcome back. 
MARK And thank you for coming to visit. 
FATHER BRENDAN I know it's been awhile since we talked about this... About Cheryl. At the time, you seemed to feel so badly about her... or about it? 
MARK I no longer feel like that. 
Father Brendan is rather taken by surprise. 
FATHER BRENDAN Oh? That's good to hear. In the end, you're glad that you did it? 
MARK Yes, I am. In fact, at this point in time, I feel very blessed. 
FATHER BRENDAN Blessed? 
MARK Yes, blessed. They put me on this new anti-depressant and now I can really see life from the cup half full rather than cup half empty point of view. 
Father Brendan looks truly amazed. 
MARK (CONT'D) It takes about six weeks to kick in, but when it does, you can really tell the difference. 
FATHER BRENDAN Hey, that's great. 
Mark grins. 
MARK I'm pulling your leg, Father. I'm not on drugs. I have a girlfriend. 
FATHER BRENDAN You're kidding me. A real girlfriend? 
MARK A very real girlfriend. She adores me. She'll do anything for me. And I can get pretty kinky sometimes, believe you me. Her name is Susan. 
FATHER BRENDAN I'm flabbergasted. Is she pretty? 
MARK She sure is. FATHER BRENDAN Has she got a sister? 
MARK As a matter of fact... FATHER BRENDAN I'm kidding. MARK No, you're not. Anyway, we're starting a publishing company together. 
Father Brendan smiles and shakes his head. 
FATHER BRENDAN Here I was, all prepared to offer comfort to the forlorn - that's supposed to be my specialty - and now I can just throw away that little speech. 
MARK No, no. Please make the little speech. I'd love to hear it. 89A.

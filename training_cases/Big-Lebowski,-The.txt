THE BIG LEBOWSKI 
THE BIG LEBOWSKI 
We are floating up a steep scrubby slope.  We hear male voices gently singing "Tumbling Tumbleweeds" and a deep, affable, Western-accented voice--Sam Elliot's, perhaps: 
VOICE-OVER A way out west there was a fella, fella I want to tell you about, fella by the name of Jeff Lebowski.  At least, that was the handle his lovin' parents gave him, but he never had much use for it himself.  This Lebowski, he called himself the Dude. Now, Dude, that's a name no one would self-apply where I come from.  But then, there was a lot about the Dude that didn't make a whole lot of sense to me.  And a lot about where he lived, like- wise.  But then again, maybe that's why I found the place s'durned innarestin'. 
We top the rise and the smoggy vastness of Los Angeles at twilight stretches out before us. 
VOICE-OVER They call Los Angeles the City of Angels.  I didn't find it to be that exactly, but I'll allow as there are some nice folks there.  'Course, I can't say I seen London, and I never been to France, and I ain't never seen no queen in her damn undies as the fella says.  But I'll tell you what, after seeing Los Angeles and thisahere story I'm about to unfold-- wal, I guess I seen somethin' ever' bit as stupefyin' as ya'd see in any a those other places, and in English too, so I can die with a smile on my face without feelin' like the good Lord gypped me. 
INTERIOR   RALPH'S 
It is late, the supermarket all but deserted.  We are tracking in on a fortyish man in Bermuda shorts and sunglasses at the dairy case.  He is the Dude.  His rumpled look and relaxed manner suggest a man in whom casualness runs deep. 
He is feeling quarts of milk for coldness and examining their expiration dates. 
VOICE-OVER Now this story I'm about to unfold took place back in the early nineties-- just about the time of our conflict with Sad'm and the Eye-rackies.  I only mention it 'cause some- times there's a man--I won't say a hee-ro, 'cause what's a hee-ro?--but sometimes there's a man. 
The Dude glances furtively about and then opens a quart of milk.  He sticks his nose in the spout and sniffs. 
VOICE-OVER And I'm talkin' about the Dude here-- sometimes there's a man who, wal, he's the man for his time'n place, he fits right in there--and that's the Dude, in Los Angeles. 
CHECKOUT GIRL 
She waits, arms folded.  A small black-and white TV next to her register shows George Bush on the White House lawn with helicopter rotors spinning behind him. 
GEORGE BUSH This aggression will not stand. . . This will not stand! 
The Dude, peeking over his shades, scribbles something at the little customer's lectern.  Milk beads his mustache. 
VOICE-OVER ...and even if he's a lazy man, and the Dude was certainly that--quite possibly the laziest in Los Angeles County. 
The Dude has his Ralph's Shopper's Club card to one side and is making out a check to Ralph's for sixty-nine cents. 
VOICE-OVER ...which would place him high in the runnin' for laziest worldwide--but sometimes there's a man. . . sometimes there's a man. 
EXTERIOR  RALPH'S 
Long shot of the glowing Ralph's.  There are only two or three cars parked in the huge lot. 
VOICE-OVER Wal, I lost m'train of thought here. But--aw hell, I done innerduced him enough. 
The Dude is a small figure walking across the vast lot. Next to him walks a Mexican carry-out boy in a red apron and cap carrying a small brown bag holding the quart of milk. The two men's footsteps echo in the still of the night. 
After a beat of walking the Dude offhandedly points. 
DUDE It's the LeBaron. 
DUDE'S HOUSE 
The Dude is going up the walkway of a small Venice bungalow court.  He holds the paper sack in one hand and a small leatherette satchel in the other.  He awkwardly hugs the grocery bag against his chest as he turns a key in his door. 
INSIDE 
The Dude enters and flicks on a light. 
His head is grabbed from behind and tucked into an armpit. We track with him as he is rushed through the living room, his arm holding the satchel flailing away from his body. Going into the bedroom the outflung satchel catches a piece of doorframe and wallboard and rips through it, leaving a hole. 
The Dude is propelled across the bedroom and on into a small bathroom, the satchel once again taking away a piece of doorframe.  His head is plunged into the toilet.  The paper bag hugged to his chest explodes milk as it hits the toilet rim and the satchel pulverizes tile as it crashes to the floor. 
The Dude blows bubbles. 
VOICE We want that money, Lebowski.  Bunny said you were good for it. 
Hands haul the Dude out of the toilet. The Dude blubbers and gasps for air. 
VOICE Where's the money, Lebowski! 
His head is plunged back into the toilet. 
VOICE Where's the money, Lebowski! 
The hands haul him out again, dripping and gasping. 
VOICE WHERE'S THE FUCKING MONEY, SHITHEAD! 
DUDE It's uh, it's down there somewhere. Lemme take another look. 
His head is plunged back in. 
VOICE Don't fuck with us.  If your wife owes money to Jackie Treehorn, that means you owe money to Jackie Treehorn. 
The inquisitor hauls the Dude's head out one last time and flops him over so that he sits on the floor, back against the toilet. 
The Dude gropes back in the toilet with one hand. 
Looming over him is a strapping blond man. 
WALTER This was a valued, uh. 
Donny, the strike-scoring bowler, enters and sits next Walter. 
DONNY What tied the room together, Dude? 
WALTER Were you listening to the story, Donny? 
DONNY What-- 
WALTER Were you listening to the Dude's story? 
DONNY I was bowling-- 
WALTER So you have no frame of reference, Donny.  You're like a child who wanders in in the middle of a movie and wants to know-- 
DUDE What's your point, Walter? 
WALTER There's no fucking reason--here's my point, Dude--there's no fucking reason-- 
DONNY Yeah Walter, what's your point? 
WALTER Huh? 
DUDE What's the point of--we all know who was at fault, so what the fuck are you talking about? 
WALTER Huh?  No!  What the fuck are you talking--I'm not--we're talking about unchecked aggression here-- 
DONNY What the fuck is he talking about? 
DUDE My rug. 
WALTER Forget it, Donny.  You're out of your element. 
DUDE This Chinaman who peed on my rug, I can't go give him a bill so what the fuck are you talking about? 
WALTER What the fuck are you talking about?! This Chinaman is not the issue!  I'm talking about drawing a line in the sand, Dude.  Across this line you do not, uh--and also, Dude, Chinaman is not the preferred, uh. . . Asian- American.  Please. 
DUDE Walter, this is not a guy who built the rail- roads, here, this is a guy who peed on my-- 
WALTER What the fuck are you-- 
DUDE Walter, he peed on my rug-- 
DONNY He peed on the Dude's rug-- 
WALTER YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR ELEMENT!  This Chinaman is not the issue, Dude. 
DUDE So who-- 
WALTER Jeff Lebowski.  Come on.  This other Jeffrey Lebowski.  The millionaire. He's gonna be easier to find anyway than these two, uh. these two  . . . And he has the wealth, uh, the resources obviously, and there is no reason, no FUCKING reason, why his wife should go out and owe money and they pee on your rug.  Am I wrong? 
DUDE No, but-- 
WALTER Am I wrong! 
DUDE Yeah, but-- 
WALTER Okay. That, uh. 
He elaborately clears his throat. 
That rap really tied the room together, did it not? 
DUDE Fuckin' A. 
DONNY And this guy peed on it. 
WALTER Donny!  Please! 
DUDE Yeah, I could find this Lebowski guy-- 
DONNY His name is Lebowski?  That's your name, Dude! 
DUDE Yeah, this is the guy, this guy should compensate me for the fucking rug. I mean his wife goes out and owes money and they pee on my rug. 
WALTER Thaaat's right Dude; they pee on your fucking Rug. 
CLOSE ON A PLAQUE 
We pull back from the name JEFFREY LEBOWSKI engraved in silver to reveal that the plaque, from Variety Clubs International, honors Lebowski as ACHIEVER OF THE YEAR. 
Reflected in the plaque we see the Dude entering the room with a YOUNG MAN.  We hear the two men talk: 
YOUNG MAN And this is the study.  You can see the various commendations, honorary degrees, et cetera. 
DUDE Yes, uh, very impressive. 
YOUNG MAN Please, feel free to inspect them. 
DUDE You mean, did you personally come and pee on my-- 
LEBOWSKI Hello!  Do you speak English?  Parla usted Inglese?  I'll say it again. Did I urinate on your rug? 
DUDE Well no, like I said, Woo peed on the rug-- 
LEBOWSKI Hello!  Hello!  So every time--I just want to understand this, sir-- every time a rug is micturated upon in this fair city, I have to compensate the-- 
DUDE Come on, man, I'm not trying to scam anybody here, I'm just-- 
LEBOWSKI You're just looking for a handout like every other--are you employed, Mr. Lebowski? 
DUDE Look, let me explain something. I'm not Mr. Lebowski;  you're Mr. Lebowski.  I'm the Dude.  So that's what  you  call me.  That, or Duder. His  Dudeness.  Or El Duderino, if, you know, you're not into the whole brevity thing-- 
LEBOWSKI Are you employed, sir? 
DUDE Employed? 
LEBOWSKI You don't go out and make a living dressed like that in the middle of a weekday. 
DUDE Is this a--what day is this? 
LEBOWSKI But I do work, so if you don't mind-- 
DUDE No, look.  I do mind.  The Dude minds. This will not stand, ya know, this will not stand, man.  I mean, if your wife owes-- 
LEBOWSKI My wife is not the issue here. I hope that my wife will someday learn to live on her allowance, which is ample, but if she doesn't, sir, that will be her problem, not mine, just as your rug is your problem, just as every bum's lot in life is his own responsibility regardless of whom he chooses to blame.  I didn't blame anyone for the loss of my legs, some chinaman in Korea took them from me but I went out and achieved anyway. I can't solve your problems, sir, only you can. 
The Dude rises. 
DUDE Ah fuck it. 
LEBOWSKI Sure!  Fuck it!  That's your answer! Tattoo it on your forehead!  Your answer to everything! 
The Dude is heading for the door. 
LEBOWSKI Your "revolution" is over, Mr. Lebowski!  Condolences!  The bums lost! 
As the Dude opens the door. 
LEBOWSKI ...My advice is, do what your parents did!  Get a job, sir!  The bums will always lose-- do you hear me, Lebowski?  THE BUMS WILL ALWAYS-- 
The Dude shuts the door on the old man's bellowing to find himself-- 
HALLWAY --in a high coffered hallway.  Brandt is approaching. 
BRANDT How was your meeting, Mr. Lebowski? 
DUDE Okay.  The old man told me to take any rug in the house. 
WALKWAY 
A houseman with a rolled-up carpet on one shoulder goes down a stone walk that winds through the back lawn, past a swimming pool to a garage.  Brandt and the Dude follow. 
BRANDT Manolo will load it into your car for you, uh, Dude. 
DUDE It's the LeBaron. 
DUDE'S POINT OF VIEW 
Tracking toward the pool.  A young woman sits facing it, her back to us, leaning forward to paint her toenails. 
Beyond her a black form floats in an inflatable chair in the pool. 
BRANDT Well, enjoy, and perhaps we'll see you again some time, Dude. 
DUDE Yeah sure, if I'm ever in the neighborhood, need to use the john. 
CLOSER TRACK 
Arcing around the woman's foot as she finishes painting the nails emerald green. 
THE DUDE 
Looking. 
WIDER 
The young woman looks up at him.  She is in her early twenties. 
She leans back and extends her leg toward the Dude. 
YOUNG WOMAN Blow on them. 
The Dude pulls his sunglasses down his nose and peeks over them. 
DUDE Huh? 
She waggles her foot and giggles. 
DUDE Hey man-- 
WALTER Fucking dog has papers, Dude.--Over the line! 
Smokey turns from his last roll to look at Walter. 
WALTER Smokey Huh? 
WALTER Over the line, Smokey!  I'm sorry. That's a foul. 
SMOKEY Bullshit.  Eight, Dude. 
WALTER Excuse me!  Mark it zero.  Next frame. 
SMOKEY Bullshit. Walter! 
WALTER This is not Nam.  This is bowling. There are rules. 
DUDE Come on Walter, it's just--it's Smokey.  So his toe slipped over a little, it's just a game. 
WALTER This is a league game.  This determines who enters the next round- robin, am I wrong? 
SMOKEY Yeah, but-- 
WALTER Am I wrong!? 
SMOKEY Yeah, but I wasn't over.  Gimme the marker, Dude,  I'm marking it an eight. 
Walter takes out a gun. 
WALTER Smokey my friend, you're entering a world of pain. 
DUDE Hey Walter-- 
WALTER Mark that frame an eight, you're entering a world of pain. 
SMOKEY I'm not-- 
WALTER A world of pain. 
A manager in a bowling-shirt style uniform is running for a phone. 
SMOKEY Look Dude, I don't hold with this. This guy is your partner, you should-- 
Walter primes the gun and points it at his head. 
WALTER HAS THE WHOLE WORLD GONE CRAZY?  AM I THE ONLY ONE HERE WHO GIVES A SHIT ABOUT THE RULES?  MARK IT ZERO! 
The Pomeranian is excitedly yapping at Walter's elbow, making high body-twisting tail-wagging leaps. 
DUDE Walter, they're calling the cops, put the piece away. 
WALTER MARK IT ZERO! 
SMOKEY Walter-- 
WALTER YOU THINK I'M FUCKING AROUND HERE? MARK IT ZERO!! 
SMOKEY All right!  There it is!  It's fucking zero! 
He points frantically at the score projected above the lane. 
SMOKEY You happy, you crazy fuck? 
WALTER This is a league game, Smokey! 
PARKING LOT 
Walter and the Dude walk to the Dude's car.  The Pomeranian trots happily behind Walter who totes the empty carrier. 
DUDE Walter, you can't do that.  These guys're like me, they're pacificists. Smokey was a conscientious objector. 
WALTER You know Dude, I myself dabbled with pacifism at one point.  Not in Nam, of course-- 
DUDE And you know Smokey has emotional problems! 
WALTER You mean--beyond pacifism? 
DUDE He's fragile, man!  He's very fragile! 
As the two men get into the car: 
WALTER Huh.  I did not know that.  Well, it's water under the bridge.  And we do enter the next round-robin, am I wrong? 
DUDE No, you're not wrong-- 
WALTER Am I wrong! 
DUDE You're not wrong, Walter, you're just an asshole. 
WALTER Well, there isn't a literal connection, Dude. 
DUDE Walter, face it, there isn't any connection.  It's your roll. 
WALTER Have it your way.  The point is-- 
DUDE It's your roll-- 
WALTER The fucking point is-- 
DUDE It's your roll. 
VOICE Are you ready to be fucked, man? 
They both look up. 
Quintana, on his way out, looks down at them from the lip of the lanes.  Over his polyester all-in-one he now wears a windbreaker with a racing stripe and "Jesus" stitched on the breast.  He is holding a fancy black-and-red leather ball satchel (perhaps a Sylvia Wein).  Behind him stands his partner, O'Brien, a short fat Irishman with tufted red hair. 
QUINTANA I see you rolled your way into the semis.  Deos mio, man.  Seamus and me, we're gonna fuck you up. 
DUDE Yeah well, that's just, ya know, like, your opinion, man. 
Quintana looks at Walter. 
QUINTANA Let me tell you something, bendeco. You pull any your crazy shit with us, you flash a piece out on the lanes, I'll take it away from you and stick it up your ass and pull the fucking trigger til it goes "click". 
DUDE Jesus. 
QUINTANA You said it, man.  Nobody fucks with the Jesus. 
Jesus walks away.  Walter nods sadly. 
WALTER Eight-year-olds, Dude. 
DUDE'S BUNGALOW 
We are looking down at the Dude who is prone on the rug. His eyes are closed.  He wears a Walkman headset.  Leaking tinnily through the headphones we can just hear an intermittent clatter. 
In his outflung hand lies a cassette case labeled VENICE BEACH LEAGUE PLAYOFFS 1987. 
The Dude absently licks his lips as we faintly hear a hall rumbling down the lane.  On its impact with the pins, the Dude opens his eyes. 
He screams. 
A blonde woman looms over him.  Next to  her a  young man in paint-spattered denims stoops and swings something towards the carrier. 
The sap catches the Dude on the chin and sends  his head thunking back onto the rug. 
A million stars explode against a field of black.  We hear the "La-la-la-la" of The Man in Me. 
The black field  dissolves into  the pattern  of the  rug. The rug rolls away to reveal an aerial view of  the city  of Los  Angeles at twilight, moving below us at great speed. 
The Dude is flying over the city, his arms thrown out in front of him, the wind whipping his hair and billowing his bowling shirt. He looks up. 
Ahead the mysterious blonde woman wings away, riding on the Dude's rug like a sheik on a magic carpet.  She is outpacing us, growing smaller. 
The Dude does a couple of lazy crawl strokes and then notices that a bowling ball has materialized in his forward hand. His bemusement turns to concern over the aerodynamic implications just as the ball seems to suddenly assume its weight, abruptly snapping his arm down, and him after it. He is falling. From a high angle we see the Dude hurtling down toward the city, dragged by the ball. 
A  reverse  looking  up shows  the Dude  hurtling toward  us out  of the inky  sky,  his eyes  wide with  horror.  Led by the bowling  ball, he zooms past the camera leaving us in black. 
We hear a distant rumble, like thunder.  Dull reflections materialize in the darkness.  They are glints off the shiny surface of an oncoming bowling ball. 
We pull back to reveal that the blackness was the inside of a ball return, and the gleaming bowling ball is being regurgitated up at us, overtaking us. 
The Dude looks up, up, up at the looming ball, its mass rolling a huge shadow across his face. 
The gleaming ball shows three dead black holes rolling toward us --finger holes. 
The largest--thumb--hole rolls directly over us, engulfing us once again in black.. 
The black rolls away and we are spinning--spinning down a bowling lane--our point of view that of someone trapped in the thumbhole of the rolling ball. 
We see the receding bowler spinning away.  It is the blonde woman, performing her follow-through. 
Floor spins up at us and then away; ceiling spins up and away; the length of the alley with pins at the end; floor; ceiling; approaching pins; again and again. 
We hit the pins and clatter into blackness.  We hear pins spin, hit each other and drop. 
We hear an irritating, insistent beeping. 
FADE IN 
We are close on the Dude, upside down.  As the picture fades in the bowling noises continue, but filtered and faint. They come from the Dude's Walkman, the headset of which is now askew, with one arm off his ear. 
As the Dude opens his eyes we spiral slowly upward to put him right side around.  His head is now resting against hardwood floor, not rug. 
DUDE Oh man. 
He  raises  himself  onto  his  elbows  and  massages  the red   lump  on his  jaw.  The  beeper  on his  belt is blinking red  in sync  with the continuing irritating beeps. 
VOICE Okay, listen-- 
Walter looks over at the Dude and bellows: 
WALTER Dude, are you fucking this up? 
VOICE Who is that? 
DUDE The driver man, I told you-- 
Click.  Dial tone. 
DUDE Oh shit.  Walter. 
WALTER What the fuck is going on there? 
DUDE They hung up, Walter!  You fucked it up!  You fucked it up!  Her life was in our hands! 
WALTER Easy, Dude. 
DUDE We're screwed now!  We don't get shit and they're gonna kill her! We're fucked, Walter! 
WALTER Dude, nothing is fucked.  Come on. You're being very unDude.  They'll call back.  Look, she kidnapped her-- 
The phone chirps. 
WALTER Ya see?  Nothing is fucked up here, Dude.  Nothing is fucked.  These guys are fucking amateurs-- 
DUDE Shutup, Walter!  Don't fucking say peep when I'm doing business here. 
WALTER (patronizing) Okay Dude.  Have it your way. 
The Dude unclips the phone from the battery pack. 
WALTER But they're amateurs. 
The Dude glares at Walter.  Into the phone: 
DUDE Dude here. 
VOICE Okay, vee proceed.  But only if there is no funny stuff. 
DUDE Yeah. 
VOICE So no funny stuff.  Okay? 
DUDE Hey, just tell me where the fuck you want us to go. 
A HIGHWAY SIGN:  SIMI VALLEY ROAD 
It flashes by in the headlights of the roaring car. 
DUDE That was the sign. 
Walter wrestles the car onto the two-lane road. 
WALTER Yeah.  So as long as we get her back, nobody's in a position to complain. And we keep the baksheesh. 
DUDE Terrific, Walter.  But you haven't told me how we get her back.  Where is she? 
WALTER That's the simple part, Dude.  When we make the handoff, I grab the guy and beat  it out of him. 
He looks at the Dude. 
WALTER ...Huh? 
DUDE Yeah.  That's a great plan, Walter. That's fucking ingenious, if I understand it correctly.  That's a Swiss fucking watch. 
WALTER Thaaat's right, Dude.  The beauty of this is its simplicity. If the plan gets too complex something always goes wrong.  If there's one thing I learned in Nam-- 
The phone chirps. 
DUDE Dude. 
VOICE You are approaching a vooden britch. When you cross it you srow ze bag from ze left vindow of ze moving kar.  Do not slow down.  Vee vatch you. 
Click.  Dial tone. 
DUDE FUCK. 
WALTER What'd he say?  Where's the hand- off? 
DUDE There is no fucking hand-off, Walter! At a wooden bridge we throw the money out  of the car! 
WALTER Huh? 
DUDE We throw the money out of the moving car! 
Walter stares dumbly for a beat. 
WALTER Huh?  Oh, him, yeah.  Well I don't see, um-- what exactly is the problem? 
The portable phone stops ringing. 
DUDE Huh?  The problem is--what do you mean what's the--there's no--we didn't-- they're gonna kill that poor woman-- 
WALTER What the fuck're you talking about? That poor woman--that poor slut-- kidnapped herself, Dude.  You said so yourself-- 
DUDE No, Walter!  I said I thought she kidnapped herself!  You're the one who's so fucking certain-- 
WALTER That's right, Dude, 1  % certain-- 
Donny is trotting excitedly up. 
DONNY They posted the next round of the tournament-- 
WALTER Donny, shut the f--when do we play? 
DONNY This Saturday.  Quintana and-- 
WALTER Saturday!  Well they'll have to reschedule. 
DUDE Walter, what'm I gonna tell Lebowski? 
WALTER I told that fuck down at the league office-- who's in charge of scheduling? 
DUDE Walter-- 
DONNY Burkhalter. 
WALTER I told that kraut a fucking thousand times I don't roll on shabbas. 
DONNY It's already posted. 
WALTER WELL THEY CAN FUCKING UN-POST IT! 
DUDE Who gives a shit, Walter?  What about that poor woman?  What do we tell-- 
WALTER C'mon Dude, eventually she'll get sick of her little game and, you know, wander back-- 
DONNY How come you don't roll on Saturday, Walter? 
WALTER I'm shomer shabbas. 
DONNY What's that, Walter? 
DUDE Yeah, and in the meantime what do I tell Lebowski? 
WALTER Saturday is shabbas.  Jewish day of rest.  Means I don't work, I don't drive a car, I don't fucking ride in a car, I don't handle money, I don't turn on the oven, and I sure as shit don't fucking roll! 
DONNY Sheesh. 
DUDE Walter, how-- 
WALTER Shomer shabbas. 
The Dude gets to his feet with the portable phone. 
DUDE That's it.  I'm out of here. 
WALTER For Christ's sake, Dude. 
Walter and Donny join the Dude as he walks out of the bowling alley. 
Hell, you just tell him--well, you tell him, uh, we made the hand-off, everything went, uh, you know-- 
DONNY Oh yeah, how'd it go? 
WALTER Went alright.  Dude's car got a little dinged up-- 
DUDE But Walter, we didn't make the fucking hand- off!  They didn't get, the fucking money and they're gonna-- they're gonna-- 
WALTER Yeah yeah, "kill that poor woman." 
He waves both arms as if conducting a symphony orchestra. 
WALTER Kill that poor woman. 
DONNY Walter, if you can't ride in a car, how d'you get around on Shammas-- 
WALTER Really, Dude, you surprise me. They're not gonna kill shit.  They're not gonna do shit.  What can they do?  Fuckin' amateurs.  And meanwhile, look at the bottom line.  Who's sitting on a million fucking dollars? Am I wrong? 
DUDE Walter-- 
WALTER Who's got a fucking million fucking dollars parked in the trunk of our car out here? 
DUDE "Our" car, Walter? 
WALTER And what do they got, Dude?  My dirty undies.  My fucking whites--Say, where is  the car? 
He followed us here. 
The Dude turns to look. 
HIS POV 
Halfway up the block a Volkswagon bug has pulled over to the curb.  In the driver's seat we see a fat man's shape. 
THE DUDE 
He scowls. 
DUDE When did he- 
The Dude is grabbed from behind and muscled away in a half- nelson by another uniformed chauffeur. 
SECOND CHAUFFEUR Into the limo, you sonofabitch.  No arguments. 
As he is frog-marched towards another limo the Dude holds his drink away from his chest and cups a hand underneath it. 
DUDE Fuck, man!  There's a beverage here! 
The waiting limo's back door is flung open. 
INSIDE 
The Dude is shoved in and awkwardly takes a seat facing the rear. The door is slammed behind him. 
LEBOWSKI Start talking and talk fast you lousy bum! 
BRANDT We've been frantically trying to reach you, Dude. 
Brandt sits catty-corner from the Dude; directly across from the Dude is the big Lebowski, a comforter across his knees. 
LEBOWSKI Where's my goddamn money, you bum?! 
DUDE Well we--I don't-- 
LEBOWSKI They did not receive the money, you nitwit!  They  did not receive the goddamn money.  HER LIFE WAS IN YOUR HANDS! 
BRANDT This is our concern, Dude. 
DUDE No, man, nothing is fucked here-- 
LEBOWSKI NOTHING IS FUCKED! THE GODDAMN PLANE HAS CRASHED INTO THE MOUNTAIN! 
The Dude takes a hurried sip from his drink. 
DUDE C'mon man, who're you gonna believe? Those guys are--we dropped off the damn money-- 
LEBOWSKI WHAT?! 
DUDE I--the royal we, you know, the editorial--I dropped off the money, exactly as per--Look, I've got certain information, certain things have come to light, and uh, has it ever occurred to you, man, that given the nature of all this new shit, that, uh, instead of running around blaming me, that this whole thing might just be, not, you know, not just such a simple, but uh--you know? 
LEBOWSKI What in God's holy name are you blathering about? 
DUDE I'll tell you what I'm blathering about!  I got information--new shit has come to light and--shit, man! She kidnapped herself! 
Lebowski stares at him, dumbstruck.  The Dude is encouraged. 
DUDE Well sure, look at it!  Young trophy wife, I mean, in the parlance of our times, owes money all over town, including to known pornographers-- and that's cool, that's cool-- but I'm saying, she needs money, and of course they're gonna say they didn't get it 'cause she wants more, man, she's gotta feed the monkey, I mean-- hasn't that ever occurred to you...? Sir? 
LEBOWSKI (quietly) No.  No Mr. Lebowski, that had not occurred to me. 
BRANDT That had not occurred to us, Dude. 
DUDE Well, okay, you're not privy to all the new shit, so uh, you know, but that's what you pay me for.  Speaking of which, would it be possible for me to get my twenty grand in cash? I gotta check this with my accountant of course, but my concern is that, you know, it could bump me into a higher tax-- 
LEBOWSKI Brandt, give him the envelope. 
DUDE Well, okay, if you've already made out the check.  Brandt is handing him a letter-sized envelope which is distended by something inside. 
BRANDT We received it this morning. 
The Dude, frowning, untucks its flap, takes out some cotton wadding and unrolls it. 
LEBOWSKI Since you have failed to achieve, even in the modest task that was your charge, since you have stolen my money, and since you have unrepentantly betrayed my trust. 
The wadding, undone, reveals a smaller wad of gauze taped up inside.  The Dude undoes the tape with his fingernails and starts to unroll the inner package. 
LEBOWSKI I have no choice but to tell these bums that they should do whatever is necessary to recover their money from you, Jeffrey Lebowski.  And with Brandt as my witness, tell you this:  Any further harm visited upon Bunny, shall be visited tenfold upon your head. 
Between thumb and forefinger the Dude holds up the contents of the package--a little toe, with emerald green nail polish. 
LEBOWSKI ...By God sir.  I will not abide another toe. 
COFFEE SHOP 
The Dude and Walter sit at the counter, both staring off into space, both absently stirring their coffee with little clinking noises. 
A man saunters up to the bar to take the stool that Walter vacated.  He is middle-aged, amiable, craggily handsome--Sam Elliot, perhaps.  He has a large Western-style mustache and wears denims, a yoked shirt and a cowboy hat. 
TO THE BARTENDER: 
MAN D'ya have a good sarsaparilla? 
We recognize the voice of The Stranger whose narration opened the movie. 
BARTENDER Sioux City Sarsaparilla. 
The Stranger nods. 
THE STRANGER That's a good one. 
Waiting for his drink, he looks amiably around the bar.  His crinkled eyes settle on the Dude. 
THE STRANGER How ya doin' there, Dude? 
The Dude, still staring down at his drink, shakes his head. 
DUDE Ahh, not so good, man. 
THE STRANGER One a those days, huh.  Wal, a wiser fella than m'self once said, sometimes you eat the bar and sometimes the bar, wal, he eats you. 
DUDE (absently) Uh-huh.  That some kind of Eastern thing? 
THE STRANGER Far from it. 
DUDE Mm. 
The bartender puts a brown bottle and a frosted glass on the bar in front of The Stranger, who touches his hat brim. 
THE STRANGER Much obliged. 
He looks back at the Dude. 
THE STRANGER I like your style, Dude. 
THE DUDE LOOKS UP, ABSENTLY: 
DUDE Well I like your style too, man. Got a whole cowboy thing goin'. 
THE STRANGER Thankie. . . Just one thing, Dude. D'ya have to use s'many cuss words? 
The Dude looks at The Stranger as if just now noticing how out of place the cowpoke is. 
DUDE The fuck are you talking about? 
The Stranger chuckles indulgently and pushes off from the bar. 
THE STRANGER Okay, have it your way. 
He brushes his hat brim with a fingertip. 
THE STRANGER Take it easy, Dude. 
DUDE Yeah.  Thanks man. 
He is gone.  "Tumbling Tumbleweeds" is ending as we hear an offscreen voice, breaking the spell: 
VOICE Dude!  Dude! 
THE DUDE LOOKS: 
Tony, the unformed limo driver, is at the door of the bar, beckoning. 
MAUDE'S LOFT 
She strides toward us, naked under a robe which she is just cinching shut.  Paint flecks her skin. 
MAUDE Jeffrey, you haven't gone to the doctor. 
DUDE No it's fine, really, uh-- 
MAUDE Do you have any news regarding my father's money? 
DUDE I, uh... money, yeah, I gotta respecfully, 69 you know, tender my resignation on that matter, 'cause it looks like your mother really was kidnapped after all. 
MAUDE She most certainly was not! 
DUDE Hey man, why don't you fucking listen occasionally?  You might learn something.  Now I got-- 
MAUDE And please don't call her my mother. 
DUDE Now I got-- 
MAUDE She is most definitely the perpetrator and not the victim. 
DUDE I'm telling you, I got definitive evidence-- 
THE STREET 
The car careens wildly as the surrounding traffic veers off to, make way, horns blaring.  The car finally spins and comes to rest with its passenger side wrapped into a telephone poll. 
INSIDE THE CAR 
The Dude frantically grabs at his door, which won't open, and then slides over to push at the passenger door, which also won't open. 
DUDE Fuck Me. 
But he is sitting on the passenger  side now,  away from the lit butt.  He looks around for it. 
Smoke is wisping up from between the Driver's seat cushion and back cushion. 
DUDE Fuckola, man. 
He takes his beer and pours it in between the cushions. There is a hissing  sound.   But there is a piece of paper sticking out from between the cushions. 
The Dude pulls it out. 
It is lined spiral notebook paper, slightly singed and dripping beer, covered with handwriting.  In the upper right- hand corner is the name Lawrence Sellers, and under that, Mrs. Jamtoss 5th Period.  The theme is titled "The Louisiana Purchase."  In red ink is a large circled D and some handwritten marginal comments; misspelled words are circled in red throughout. 
CRANE JACKSON'S FOUNTAIN STREET THEATER 
We are behind Walter, the Dude, and Donny, facing the stage in the background where Allan, the Dude's balding landlord, is performing a dance moderne. 
As Walter talks to the Dude he leans in to him, his voice hushed, so as not to disturb the rest of the very sparse audience. 
WALTER He lives in North Hollywood on Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger-- 
DUDE The In-and-Out Burger is on Camrose. 
WALTER Near the In-and-Out Burger-- 
DONNY Those are good burgers, Walter. 
WALTER Shut the fuck up, Donny.  This kid is in the ninth grade, Dude, and his father is--are you ready for this?-- Arthur Digby Sellers. 
DUDE Who the fuck is that? 
WALTER Huh? 
DUDE Who the fuck is Arthur Digby Sellers? 
WALTER Who the f--have you ever heard of a little show called Branded, Dude? 
DUDE Yeah. 
WALTER All but one man died?  There at Bitter Creek? 
DUDE Yeah yeah, I know the fucking show Walter, so what? 
WALTER Fucking Arthur Digby Sellers wrote 156 episodes, Dude. 
DUDE Uh-huh. 
WALTER The bulk of the series. 
DUDE Uh-huh. 
WALTER Not exactly a lightweight. 
DUDE No. 
WALTER And yet his son is a fucking dunce. 
DUDE Uh. 
WALTER Yeah, go figure.  Well we'll go out there after the, uh, the. 
He waves a hand vaguely toward the stage. 
WALTER What have you.  We'll, uh-- 
DONNY We'll be near the In-and-Out Burger. 
WALTER Shut the fuck up, Donny.  We'll, uh, brace the kid--he'll be a pushover. We'll get that fucking money, if he hasn't spent it already.  Million fucking clams. And yes, we'll be near the, uh--some burgers, some beers, a few laughs.  Our fucking troubles are over, Dude. 
RESIDENTIAL AREA 
The Dude and Walter are pulling up in front of a dilapidated house sitting on a scrubby lot.  Parked incongruously in front of the house is a brand new red Corvette. 
DUDE Fuck me, man!  That kid's already spent all the money! 
WALTER Hardly Dude, a new 'vette?  The kid's still got, oh, 96 to 97 thousand, depending on the options.  Wait in the car, Donny. 
THE FRONT DOOR 
Walter rings the bell.  It is opened by a matronly Spanish woman. 
WALTER Ah, this is pointless. 
As he shoves the homework back in the attache case: 
WALTER All right, Plan B.  You might want to watch out the front window there, Larry. 
He is heading for the door.  The Dude, puzzled, rises to follow him. 
WALTER This is what happens when you FUCK a STRANGER in the ASS, Larry. 
OUTSIDE 
Walter is striding down the lawn with his attache case like an enraged encyclopedia salesman.  Without looking back at, the Dude, who follows: 
WALTER Fucking language problem, Dude. 
He pops the Dude's trunk, flings in the briefcase and takes out a tire iron. 
WALTER Maybe he'll understand this. 
He is walking over to the Corvette. 
WALTER YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS, LARRY! 
CRASH!  He swings the crowbar into the windshield, which shatters. 
WALTER YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS?! 
CRASH!  He takes out the driver's window. 
WALTER THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU FUCK A STRANGER IN THE ASS! 
Lights are going on in houses down the street.  Distant dogs bark. 
WALTER HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS, LARRY! 
CRASH! 
WALTER HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS!  FUCK A STRANGER IN THE ASS! 
CRASH! 
A man in a sleeveless T-shirt and boxer shorts has run over behind Walter and grabbed him from behind on a backswing of the crowbar. 
MAN WHAT THE FUCK JOO DOING, MANG?! 
He wrestles the crowbar away from the startled Walter. 
MAN I JUS' BAWDEEZ FUCKEEN CAR LASS WEEK! 
Walter cringes before the enraged Mexican. 
WALTER Hunh? 
The man looks about, wildly. 
MAN I KILL JOO, MANG!  I--I KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR! 
He runs over to the Dude's car. 
DUDE No!  No!  NO!  THAT'S NOT-- 
CRASH!  CRASH! 
MAN I FUCKEEN KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR! 
CRASH! 
MAN I KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR! 
INSIDE THE CAR 
Glass rains in on a terrified, cringing, Donny. 
MAN I KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR! 
ON A DEAFENING CRASH WE CUT TO: 
THE DUDE'S CAR 
We are looking into the car through the broken windshield as it rattles down the freeway.  Wind whistles through the caved- in windows. 
The Dude drives, his jaw clenched, staring grimly out at the 
road.  Walter, beside him, and Donny in the back seat, munch 'on In-and-Out Burgers. 
Creedence music plays above the bluster of wind. 
DUDE'S BUNGALOW 
He is getting to his feet, but sways woozily. 
DUDE I'll go out and mingle.--Jesus, you mix a hell of a Caucasian, Jackie. 
The Dude shakes his head, tries to focus. 
TREEHORN A fifteen-year-old?  Is this your idea of a joke? 
Jackie Treehorn's image starts to swim.  He is joined on either side by Woo and the blond man, all three men looking grimly down at the Dude. 
DUDE No funny stuff, Jackie. . . the kid's got it.  Hiya, fellas. . . kid just wanted a car.  All the Dude ever wanted. . . was his rug back. . . not greedy. . . it really. 
He squints at Jackie Treehorn, who swims in and out of focus. Tied the room together. 
He tips forward, spilling his drink off the table. 
FROM UNDER THE GLASS COFFEE TABLE 
Looking up at the Dude as his face hits the glass and squishes. 
FAST FADE OUT 
BLACK 
THE STRANGER'S VOICE Darkness warshed over the Dude-- darker'n a black steer's tookus on a moonless prairie night.  There was no bottom. 
We hear a thundering bass. 
SCRATCHY WHITE TITLE CARD: 
JACKIE TREEHORN PRESENTS 
ANOTHER TITLE CARD: 
THE DUDE 
AND 
MAUDE LEBOWSKI 
IN 
THIRD TITLE CARD: 
GUTTERBALLS 
The title logo is a suggestively upright bowling pin flanked by a pair of  bowling balls.   The  bending bass sound turns into the lead-in to Kenny Rogers and the First Edition's "Just Dropped In." 
The Dude is walking down a long corridor dressed as a cable repairman.  The Dude's face is washed with a brilliant light as the corridor opens onto a gleaming bowling alley. 
In the center of the alley stands Maude Lebowski, singing operatic harmony to the Kenny Rogers song.  She wears an armored breastplate and Norse headgear, has braided pigtails, and holds a trident. 
The Dude stands behind her and, pressed up against her, helps her with her follow-through as she releases a bowling ball. 
The lane is straddled by a line of chorines in spangly mini- skirts, their arms akimbo, Busby-Berkley style, their legs turning the lane into a tunnel leading to the pins at the end. 
But it is no longer a bowling ball rolling between their legs--it is the Dude himself, levitating inches off the lane, the tools from his utility belt swinging free.  He is face down, his arms, torpedolike, pressed against his sides. 
His point of view shows the lane rushing by below, the little ball-guide arrows zipping by. 
The Dude twists his body around, performing a barrel-roll so that he is now gliding along the lane face-up. 
Now his point of view looks up the dresses of the passing chorines. 
The Dude smiles dreamily and does a backstroke motion so that he is once again gliding face-down.  He looks forward and his forward momentum blows back his hair. 
Coming at us, as we go through the last few pairs of legs, are the approaching pins.  We hit the pins, scattering them, and rush on into black. 
A body drops down into the blackness in slow motion--a topless woman, squealing, her legs kicking. 
As she drops out of frame, leaving blackness again, three men are entering from the background, emerging into a pool of light.  It is the Germans, advancing ominously, wielding oversized shears which they menacingly scissor. 
The Dude, now standing in a field of black, reacts to the advancing Germans.  He turns and runs, fists pumping. 
The scissoring sound of the shears turns into the whoosh of car-bys.  The field of black is punctured by headlights. The Dude is running blearily down the middle of the Pacific Coast Highway. Cars rush by on either side, horns blaring. 
With the BLOO-WHUP of a short siren blast, a squad car with flashing gumballs pulls up. 
SQUAD CAR 
The Dude sits in the back seat, his head lolling with the motion of the car as he blearily sings the theme of Branded: 
DUDE He was innocent.  Not a charge was true.  And they say he ran awaaaaaay. 
CHIEF'S OFFICE 
The Dude is hurled against the chief's desk, which he bounces off of, to come to rest more or less seated in a facing chair. 
His wallet is tossed onto the desk. 
Maude emerges from the bedroom.  She is wearing a bathrobe. 
MAUDE Jeffrey. 
DUDE Maude? 
She pulls open the bathrobe as she approaches. 
MAUDE Love me. 
The Dude is stupefied. 
DUDE That's my robe. 
THOOMP!  ON THE EMBRACE WE CUT TO: 
BLACK 
After a beat, a long sigh, and then a voice from the blackness: 
MAUDE Tell me a little about yourself, Jeffrey. 
DUDE Well, uh. . . Not much to tell. 
A match is dragged across a headboard; the Dude is lighting himself a joint.  He shakes the match out to restore blackness except for the glowing tip of the joint. 
DUDE I was, uh, one of the authors of the Port Huron Statement.--The original Port Huron Statement. 
MAUDE Uh-huh. 
DUDE Not the compromised second draft. And then I, uh. . . Ever hear of the Seattle Seven? 
MAUDE Mmnun. 
Click--the Dude turns on a bedside lamp.  He and Maude lie next to each other in bed. 
DUDE And then. . . let's see, I uh--music business briefly. 
MAUDE Oh? 
DUDE Yeah.  Roadie for Metallica.  Speed of Sound Tour. 
MAUDE Uh-huh. 
DUDE Bunch of assholes.  And then, you know, little of this, little of that. My career's, uh, slowed down a bit lately. 
MAUDE What do you do for fun? 
DUDE Oh, you know, the usual.  Bowl. Drive around.  The occasional acid flashback. 
He climbs out of bed but Maude remains in it.  She wedges a pillow into the small of her back and clasps a hand on each kneecap.  She pulls her knees in toward her chest to keep her pelvis raised. 
MAUDE What happened to your house? 
DUDE Jackie Treehorn trashed the place. Wanted to save the finder's fee. 
MAUDE Finder's fee? 
DUDE He thought I had your father's money, so he got me out of the way while he looked for it. 
MAUDE It's not my father's money, it's the Foundation's.  Why did he think you had it?  And who does? 
DUDE Larry Sellers, a high-school kid. Real fucking brat. 
He picks a White Russian off the bedside table. 
MAUDE Jeffrey-- 
DUDE It's a complicated case, Maude. Lotta ins, lotta outs.  Fortunately I've been adhering to a pretty strict, uh, drug regimen to keep my mind, you know, limber.  I'm real fucking close to your father's money, real fucking close.  It's just-- 
MAUDE I keep telling you, it's the Foundation's money.  Father doesn't have any. 
DUDE Huh?  He's fucking loaded. 
MAUDE No no, the wealth was all Mother's. 
DUDE But your father--he runs stuff, he-- 
MAUDE We did let Father run one of the companies, briefly, but he didn't do very well at it. 
DUDE But he's-- 
MAUDE He helps administer the charities now, and I give him a reasonable allowance.  He has no money of his own.  I know how he likes to present himself; Father's weakness is vanity. Hence the slut. 
DUDE Huh.  Jeez.  Well, so, did he--is that yoga? 
Throughout, Maude has been lying on her back with her knees pulled in. 
MAUDE It increases the chances of conception. 
DUDE Get out of that fucking car, man! 
The man nervously complies.  The Dude flinches at the man's movement as he gets out. 
The man cringes, reacting to the Dude's flinch. 
He is wearing a cheap blue serge suit.  He is bald with a short fringe and a mustache. 
The Dude shouts to cover his fear: 
DUDE Who the fuck are you, man!  Come on, man! 
MAN Relax, man!  No physical harm intended! 
DUDE Who the fuck are you?  Why've you been following me?  Come on, fuckhead! 
MAN Hey, relax man, I'm a brother shamus. 
The Dude is stunned. 
DUDE Brother Shamus?  Like an Irish monk? 
MAN Irish m--What the fuck are you talking about?  My name's Da Fino!  I'm a private snoop!  Like you, man! 
DUDE Huh? 
DA FINO A dick, man!  And let me tell you something: I dig your work. Playing one side against the other--in bed with everybody--fabulous stuff, man. 
DUDE I'm not a--ah, fuck it, just stay away from my fucking lady friend, man. 
DA FINO Hey hey, I'm not messing with your special lady-- 
DUDE She's not my special lady, she's my fucking lady friend.  I'm just helping her conceive, man! 
DA FINO Hey, man, I'm not-- 
DUDE Who're you working for?  Lebowski? Jackie Treehorn? 
DA FINO The Gundersons. 
DUDE The?  Who the fff-- 
DA FINO The Gundersons.  It's a wandering daughter job.  Bunny Lebowski, man. Her real name is Fawn Gunderson. Her parents want her back. 
He is fumbling in his wallet. 
DA FINO See? 
The Dude looks at the picture. 
It is probably a school portrait, unmistakably Bunny, but fresh-faced, much younger looking, with a corn-fed smile and straight Partridge Family hair and bangs. 
DUDE Jesus fucking Christ. 
DA FINO Crazy, huh?  Ran away a year ago. 
He is holding out another picture. 
The Gundersons told me to show her this when I found her. The family farm. 
A bleak farmhouse and silo are the only features on a flat snow-swept landscape. 
Outside of Moorhead, Minnesota.  They think it'll make her homesick. 
DUDE Boy.  How ya gonna keep 'em down on the farm once they seen Karl Hungus. 
He hands back the picture. 
She's been kidnapped, Da Fino.  Or maybe not, but she's definitely not around. 
DA FINO Fuck, man!  That's terrible! 
DUDE Yeah, it sucks. 
DA FINO Well maybe you and me could pool our resources--trade information-- professional courtesy--compeers, you know-- 
We hear distant yapping, growing louder with the hum of an approaching car. 
DUDE Yeah, I get it.  Fuck off, Da Fino. And stay away from my special la-- from my fucking lady friend. 
The Dude steps out to meet Walter's car as it pulls up, its passenger window open and the pomeranian leaning out and yapping. 
DENNY'S 
Four people sit at a booth:  Dieter, Kieffer, Franz, all in black leather, and a young woman with long stringy blonde hair, wearing torn and patched jeans and a ribbed sleeveless tee-shirt, worn thin with age.  She is apparently braless, and is teutonically pale with birthmarks on her face and arms. 
Notable  is  her  camera-side  leg,  which  ends in  a bandage- swaddled foot.  Dried rust-colored blood stains the tip of the bandage. The  four  are  arguing,  loudly,  in  German. They seem  very unhappy. A waitress enters with a checkpad and pen. 
WAITRESS You folks ready? 
DUDE But I guess she told Dieter. 
WALTER Jesus, Dude!  He never even kidnapped her. 
BRANDT Who's this gentleman, Dude? 
WALTER Who'm I?  I'm a fucking VETERAN! 
BRANDT You shouldn't go in there, Dude! He's very angry! 
BANG--the Dude and Walter push through the double doors into-- 
THE GREAT ROOM 
The big Lebowski turns at the sound of the door.  His wheelchair hums as he spins it around. 
LEBOWSKI (bitterly) Well, she's back.  No thanks to you. 
DUDE Where's the money, Lebowski? 
WALTER A MILLION BUCKS FROM FUCKING NEEDY LITTLE URBAN ACHIEVERS!  YOU ARE SCUM, MAN! 
The dog yaps. 
LEBOWSKI Who the hell is he? 
WALTER I'll tell you who I am!  I'm the guy who's gonna KICK YOUR PHONY GOLDBRICKING ASS! 
DUDE We know the briefcase was empty, man.  We know you kept the million bucks yourself. 
LEBOWSKI Well, you have your story, I have mine.  I say I entrusted the money to you, and you stole it. 
WALTER AS IF WE WOULD EVER DREAM OF TAKING YOUR BULLSHIT MONEY! 
DUDE You thought Bunny'd been kidnapped and you could use it as a pretext to make some money disappear.  All you needed was a sap to pin it on, and you'd just met me.  You thought, hey, a deadbeat, a loser, someone the square community won't give a shit about. 
LEBOWSKI Well?  Aren't you? 
DUDE Well. . . yeah. 
LEBOWSKI All right, get out.  Both of you. 
WALTER Look at that fucking phony, Dude! Pretending to be a fucking millionaire! 
LEBOWSKI I said out.  Now. 
WALTER Let me tell you something else. I've seen a lot of spinals, Dude, and this guy is a fake.  A fucking goldbricker. 
He is crossing to Lebowski. 
WALTER This guy fucking walks.  I've never been more certain of anything in my life! 
LEBOWSKI Stay away from me, mister! 
Walter reaches around from behind and hoists the big Lebowski out of the wheelchair by his armpits. 
WALTER Walk, you fucking phony! 
The big Lebowski waggles helplessly, his rubbery feet grazing the floor like a Raggedy Ann's.  The pomeranian gaily leaps and yaps. 
LEBOWSKI Put me down, you son of a bitch! 
DUDE Walter! 
WALTER It's all over, man!  We call your fucking bluff! 
DUDE WALTER, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!  HE'S CRIPPLED!  PUT HIM DOWN! 
WALTER Sure, I'll put him down, Dude.  RAUSS! ACHTUNG, BABY!! 
He shoves the big Lebowski forward and he crumples to the floor, weeping. 
WALTER Oh, shit. 
LEBOWSKI (sobbing) You're bullies!  Cowards, both of you! 
Walter is abashed.  The Big Lebowski flails about on the floor. 
WALTER Oh, shit. 
DUDE He can't walk, Walter! 
WALTER Yeah, I can see that, Dude. 
LEBOWSKI You monsters! 
DUDE Help me put him back in his chair. 
Walter moves to comply. 
DONNY Are these the Nazis, Walter? 
Walter answers, also sotto voce, his eyes still on the three men: 
WALTER They're nihilists, Donny, nothing to be afraid of. 
The Germans stop conferring. 
DIETER Vee don't care.  Vee still vant zat money or vee fuck you up. 
KIEFFER Ja, vee still vant ze money.  Vee sreaten you. 
He pulls an uzi from under his coat.  It glints in the firelight. 
WALTER Fuck you.  Fuck the three of you. 
DUDE Hey, cool it Walter. 
Walter ignores the Dude, addresses the Germans: 
WALTER There's no ransom if you don't have a fucking hostage.  That's what ransom is.  Those are the fucking rules. 
DIETER Zere ARE no ROOLZ! 
WALTER NO RULES!  YOU CABBAGE-EATING SONS- OF- BITCHES-- 
KIEFFER His girlfriend gafe up her toe!  She sought we'd be getting million dollars!  Iss not fair! 
WALTER Fair!  WHO'S THE FUCKING NIHILIST HERE!  WHAT ARE YOU, A BUNCH OF FUCKING CRYBABIES?! 
DUDE Hey, cool it Walter.  Listen, pal, there never was any money.  The big Lebowski gave me an empty briefcase, man, so take it up with him. 
WALTER AND I'D LIKE MY UNDIES BACK! 
The Germans confer again, in German. 
Donny is visibly frightened. 
DONNY Are they gonna hurt us, Walter? 
WALTER 'S TONE IS GENTLE: 
WALTER They won't hurt us, Donny.  These men are cowards. 
THE CONFERENCE ENDS: 
DIETER Okay.  Vee take ze money you haf on you und vee call it eefen. 
WALTER Fuck you. 
The Dude is digging into his pocket. 
DUDE Come on, Walter, we're ending this thing cheap. 
Walter's eyes, burning with hatred, are locked on Dieter's. 
WALTER What's mine is mine. 
DUDE Come on, Walter!. 
Louder, to the Germans, as he looks in his wallet: 
DUDE Four dollars here! 
He inspects the change in his palm. 
DUDE Almost five! 
DONNY (tremulously) I got eighteen dollars, Dude. 
WALTER (grimly) What's mine is mine. 
With a ring of steel, Dieter produces a glinting saber. 
DIETER VEE FUCK YOU UP, MAN!  VEE TAKE YOUR MONEY! 
WALTER (coolly) Come and get it. 
DIETER VEE FUCK YOU UP, MAN! 
WALTER Come and get it.  Fucking nihilist. 
DIETER I FUCK YOU!  I FUCK YOU! 
WALTER Show me what you got.  Nihilist. Dipshit with a nine-toed woman. 
In a rage, Dieter charges. 
DIETER I FUCK YOU!  I FUCK YOU! 
DUDE Wha. 
WALTER Call the medics, Dude. 
DUDE Wha. . . Donny-- 
WALTER Hurry Dude.  I'd go but I'm pumping blood.  Might pass out. 
The Dude runs into the lanes.  Walter lays a reassuring hand on Donny's shoulder. 
WALTER Rest easy, good buddy, you're doing fine.  We got help choppering in. 
FADE OUT 
HOLD IN BLACK 
THE DUDE AND WALTER 
They sit side by side, forearms on knees, in a nondescript waiting area.  Walter bounces the fingertips of one hand off those of the other.  They sit.  They wait. 
A tall thin man in a conservative black suit enters.  He eyes the Dude's bowling attire and sunglasses and Walter's army surplus, but doesn't make an issue of it. 
MAN Hello, gentlemen.  You are the bereaved? 
DUDE Yeah man. 
MAN Francis Donnelly.  Pleased to meet you. 
DUDE Jeffrey Lebowski. 
WALTER Walter Sobchak. 
DUDE The Dude, actually.  Is what, uh. 
DONNELLY Excuse me? 
DUDE Nothing. 
DONNELLY Yes.  I understand you're taking away the remains. 
WALTER Yeah. 
DONNELLY We have the urn. 
He nods through a door.  Another man in a black suit enters to carefully deposit a large silver urn on the desktop. 
DONNELLY And I assume this is credit card? 
He is vaguely handing a large leather folder across the desk to whomever wants to take it. 
WALTER Yeah. 
He takes it, opens it, puts on reading glasses that sit halfway down his nose, and inspects the bill with his head pulled back for focus and cocked for concentration.  Silence. The Dude smiles at Donnelly.  Donnelly gives back a mortician's smile.  At length Walter holds the bill towards Donnelly, pointing. 
WALTER What's this? 
DONNELLY That is for the urn. 
WALTER Don't need it.  We're scattering the ashes. 
DONNELLY Yes, so we were informed.  However, we must of course transmit the remains to you in a receptacle. 
WALTER This is a hundred and eighty dollars. 
DONNELLY Yes sir.  It is our most modestly priced receptacle. 
DUDE Well can we-- 
WALTER A hundred and eighty dollars?! 
DONNELLY They range up to three thousand. 
WALTER Yeah, but we're-- 
DUDE Can we just rent it from you? 
DONNELLY Sir, this is a mortuary, not a rental house. 
WALTER We're scattering the fucking ashes! 
DUDE Walter-- 
WALTER JUST BECAUSE WE'RE BEREAVED DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE SAPS! 
DONNELLY Sir, please lower your voice-- 
DUDE Hey man, don't you have something else you could put it in? 
DONNELLY That is our most modestly priced receptacle.

BRIDESMAIDS

Annie Mumolo 
INT. CLEAN, UPSCALE. MODERN BATHROOM. 
Annie is in nice lingerie, happily getting ready for the day. She puts a lot of effort into her appearance. Products everywhere, too many hair-flips, eye-cream, no hair out of place. She walks into the bedroom, where TED, a gorgeous man sleeps. She sneaks back into the bed, carefully positioning herself and moving the sheets to show her good parts. She coughs and nudges Ted to wake him up then pretend sleeps. 
TED Good morning. Annie pretends to wake up. 
TED (CONT'D) Wow, you look beautiful. 
ANNIE 
(ACTING EMBARRASSED) What? No. I don't. Oh my God its the morning. I look terrible. I just woke up. 
TED Last night was fun. 
ANNIE Yeah, I had the best time. I have't had that much fun on a first date in years, ever... She brushes the hair off his forehead as if he were her long time lover. 
TED So listen Annie, I like you. So, I want to be up front with you. I'm not really looking for a relationship right now. Annie's eyes grow large. She uncomfortably smiles at him, nodding. 
ANNIE Oooooo. Oops. I mean, yeah. What? 
TED I just want to be honest right off the bat. 
ANNIE Yeah, yeah. Ok. Yeah. Yeah. I love that. Annie struggles to maintain her composure. 
TED I'm just so busy and I don't have time for another person...I... 
ANNIE Yeah, me too, I'm soo busy-- 
TED And summer's coming-- 
ANNIE Yeah, summer, exactly. It's a crazy season. So you just wanna give me a call in the fall or--? 
TED Yeah, I'm not gonna be in town much even in the fall-- 
ANNIE You shouldn't be! Yeah, Halloween-- 
TED I'm gonna be travelling a lot for work. 
ANNIE Me too, I'm just- so many business trips to places that are just far awayâcause I'm doing really well at work. 
TED And honestly, (sits up) I don't even know how I feel about the whole monogamy thing, is one person really enough for anyone? I mean, I like to be with a lot of different people. 
ANNIE It is sooo refreshing to hear you say that, because isn't that what everyone thinks but is afraid to say? I mean, i's science. I'm-I don't want a relationship either. Let's just say that. And I wouldn't even care whatever you do or I do, I just wanna have tons of fun, like no strings attached at all. I'm just different from other girls. 
TED Yeah. Well anyway, I really should get going. I was gonna get a haircut today. 
ANNIE Yeah, they say that every couple months it's good to trim the ends, you know, get all the dead stuff. So, cool. Cool. 've cut hair before. He waits, but Annie doesn't budge. 
TED Well, like I said I got stuff to do. Annie notices a picture of a sailboat above the bed. 
ANNIE Yeah, me too. Gonna try to get some sailing in before the weather gets crazy... 
TED HOLLY Cool, well I don't wanna be Get up the jib.. late. Ted gets up. Awkward moment leading into... 
EXT. HOUSE. FRONT DOOR. MOMENTS LATER. 
TED Oh, and thanks for the lemon bars. 
ANNIE Oh, no problem. Made from scratch. 
EXT. DRIVEWAY 
Annie stands at the closed driveway gate waiting as Ted repeatedly presses the button. She smiles at a neighbor. 
TED Sometimes it sticks! 
ANNIE No, I love it! The gate starts to open. Annie exits. 
ANNIE (CONT'D) Byyyyee! 
EXT. STREET. OUTSIDE THE GATE 
Annie sits in her old shitty car. She lets out an exasperated sigh, then sees the clock. 
ANNIE Oh, shit. The brakes squeak as she very slowly drives away. 
INT. HARRINGTON'S JEWELRY STORE. 
Annie enters hurriedly pulling her hair into a bun. 
ANNIE Hi. Sorry, sorry! I'm here. I'm here. 
DONNA (quickly) Annie! Thank God. OK people! Gather around me please, in a tight semicircle. Annie and six other employees gather around DONNA. 
DONNA (CONT'D) (slightly overdramatic) Something terrible has happened. Donald will not be coming in to work today. He stepped on a wasp and there is some uncomfortable swelling. Employees mumble. 
DONNA (CONT'D) Annie? Where's your tie? Everyone looks at Annie. She holds it up and starts to put it on. 
DONNA (CONT'D) Now, I have an eye doctor's appointment that I can't change or they'll will charge me. So someone will have to cover for Donald in engagement rings. Now I-- Annie and SANDY, a male co-worker, shoot their hands the air eagerly. 
DONNA (CONT'D) Sandy? Today's your day. 
SANDY Ooh, my horoscope said I would be presented with an opportunity at work today. That is eerie. That is eerie. 
DONNA Annie, that means you'll be alone in keepsakes. You think you can handle it? 
EMPLOYEE (SOTTO) Yeah, look out. There might be a bum- rush for letter openers... The employees snicker. 
ANNIE Sometimes there is, so....there have been. At times, there has been. 
DONNA Alright everybody, let's get to work! Saneel?!...OPEN SESAME! SANEEL, the security guard, rolls his eyes and unlocks the doors. Everyone goes to work. Donna gathers her things and starts walking towards the exit with Annie tailing behind her. 
ANNIE Donna, can I talk to you for a second? I feel like if you gave me a shot at engagement rings sometime, I could really- 
DONNA Annie, what is the calibration of a 2 carat diamond in a standard English setting? 
ANNIE Five? 
DONNA I just made all of that up. None of that was real. I just put words together. You're not ready for the big leagues. Understand? 
ANNIE It's so hard to make commission over there. 
DONNA Sweetheart...did I ever tell you the story of the little paralyzed Chinese girl who wanted to be dancer? 
ANNIE Many times. 
DONNA She was paralyzed Annie, had no feeling in her legs, and then one day after years of believing in herself, she stood up out of that chair and tap-danced for the king. On his birthday! My point is, Sandy makes a real effort around here. He connects with the customer. And when he wants to make a sale, he goes for it. 
ANNIE Okay. (beat) I do want it. 
DONNA (smiling) Good. Showing up on time is a wonderful place to start. Donna talks to herself and gathers her things. 
DONNA (CONT'D) Uhh! A wasp! Who walks around even their own backyard without at least a thin sandal. It's reckless! Donna exits. A customer passes Anni's section. 
ANNIE Hello, can I interest you in a sterling silver money clip that will create memories for you and your family? No? We cut to a HOME IMPROVEMENT SHOW on T.V. 
T.V. HOST When Dave and Rhonda bought this house, it was a medical clinic. I've never seen so many cupboards! 
INT. ANNIE AND STEVE'S APT. THAT NIGHT. 
STEVE, Annie's mid-thirties roommate, sits on the couch shirtless and is enthralled by the show. 
STEVE Noooo. That's, that's sooo smart. Annie enters the apartment, tired. She throws her keys down and sifts through her mail. Steve presses mute. 
STEVE (CONT'D) There you are, you stayer-out-all- nighter. Did you make out? Sleep over? As Annie heads for her bedroom, he walks towards her room. 
STEVE (CONT'D) Don't go in the bathroom. Are you going to bed? 
ANNIE Yes. I'm beat. 
STEVE Your ex-boyfriend got more mail, I did what you said and just threw it away. 
ANNIE Thanks. Goodnight Steve! She shuts the door behind her. 
STEVE That credit lady called! She wants to talk to you, Annie! She's gonna find you. Steve sits back on the couch, un-mutes the T.V.. 
ALLEN (ON SHOW) This is where they bagged the animals that didn't make it through the testing. We turned it into a cozy Moroccan reading room. 
STEVE Gross/Amazing. 
INT. ANNIE'S BEDROOM. 
She sits on her bed grabs a âSounds to Relaxâ CD with a post-it that reads, âLove, Momâ. She plays it and lies down. We hear a loud Tibetan woma's voice wailing. NOT relaxing. She turns it off and curls up on top of her bed. 
INT. JONI'S RESTAURANT. THAT FRIDAY NIGHT. 
Annie and Lillian read magazines. 
LILLIAN The madness has begun. Dougie's parents are having an engagement party for us next Friday. 
ANNIE Awesome!... 
EXT. STREET/NEWSSTAND. NEXT MORNING. 
Annie, in her jogging clothes, reaches for a wedding magazine, but a woman's magazine catches her eye. It 
ANNIE (looking around) Ooh, what's this... She finds the article. âHurry, before he gets away! Top five ways to reel him in.â 
MAN (O.S) Excuse me. A HOT ATHLETIC GUY with his golden retriever is reaching for a magazine. She can't thing of what to say. She remembers the magazine! It reads â#1. A simple, flirty 
'S working! Her cell phone rings, she tries to ignore it, but it keeps ringing... 
ANNIE Hello? 
HELEN (ON PHONE) Annie!? 
ANNIE Yes? It's HELEN (early 30's) Lillian's bridesmaid and friend from the tennis Club. She's a tall leggy blond, all smiles. East coast pretty with a lot of cream cashmere turtleneck sweaters in her closet. She is sitting in a cream colored living room on a huge cream couch with lots of candles glowing. 
INTERCUT: 
HELEN Hi. 
ANNIE Hi. 
HELEN Hiiii! This is Helen. I'm one of Lillian's bridesmaids. 
ANNIE Of course, Helen. Hi! 
HELEN Congratulations on being selected. 
ANNIE Oh, thank you. Annie, reads â#2. Expose your best asset. ASAPâ She panics, starts to elongate her right leg, points her toe, flexes her leg, flips her hair. He seems confused but politely smiles and goes back to his magazine. 
HELEN Annie? 
ANNIE Sorry, yes. Hi! 
HELEN Maid of Honor!! 
ANNIE Yeah. It is quite an honor. 
HELEN It's the number one spot. So how many times have you been in the B.P? 
ANNIE I'm sorry, the what? 
HELEN Bridal Party? 
ANNIE I've never even been in a wedding before. 
HELEN What!? I've never even heard of that. 
ANNIE Um, well, it should be fun. Annie sees that the hot guy is leaving to pay for his magazine! She readsâ#5. Make a funny observational joke that pertains to HIM. (ya know, LIKE SEINFELD!!] Men LOVE 
Â SHE and the golden retriever meet eyes. 
ANNIE (CONT'D) Um Helen, can you hold on for a second? 
HELEN 
OH-- Annie covers the phone and approaches the hot guy. 
ANNIE Hey, you're dog's really cute. 
MAN Oh thanks. 
ANNIE It's kinda funny right? That when girls are ugly, they're called dogs, but dogs are cute. Annie laughs. He half smiles but does not respond. 
ANNIE (CONT'D) (beat) Well, some dogs are ugly. Some girls are ugly. I know a lot of ugly girls. But I'm not friends with them. I've seen a lot of ugly dogs too. But some people I know who are considered dogs, you know, they have a good personality, and are better looking to people cuz of that. And people who are not nice...that's ugly to me. And female dogs are called bitches, that's weird. I'm just kidding. It's a joke. I have better ones. The guy leaves. She hears a voice coming from her phone. 
HELEN'S VOICE Hello?! 
ANNIE Helen! Sorry. Yeah um, I'm really excited for all the wedding stuff and-- 
HELEN YAY! OK, I will get your e-mail from Lilly with all of the other girls' information, and when you respond to any wedding related e-mails from now on, just remember to hit âREPLY ALLâ. Did you know there are six of us? 
ANNIE Yeah, Lillian told me last night. Awkward silence. 
HELEN Well, can't wait to meet you and hear what your planning for the bachelorette. Any ideas? 
ANNIE Not yet. But they are coming, and I will fill you in-- 
STEVE Four. Nine. They stare at each other. 
EXT. HIGHWAY. LATER. 
Annie is finally driving along. she hears sirens. 
ANNIE Shit! She pulls over. OFFICER RHODES approaches, chewing gum. 
RHODES Good afternoon ma'am, You in a hurry to get out of the city? 
ANNIE No. Was I speeding? 
RHODES Is that even possible in this rig? He finds this funny, Annie does't. 
RHODES (CONT'D) You know funny thing about brake lights, you're supposed to have âem. 
ANNIE Ooooh. Yeah. Mine are out. 
RHODES Yeah, and you're headin' up Witches Curve. That's a risky move. 
ANNIE I'm sorry. I usually only drive in the city and they've never pulled me over. To tell you the truth, those lights have been out for like a year. 
RHODES Whoa, whoa, whoa, easy hot-dogger. That is not something you wanna go broadcasting to a police officer. I might feel obligated to give you a yea's worth of tickets now. 
ANNIE What? No.. I- 
RHODES You just admitted it. 
ANNIE Can you do that? 
RHODES You admitted it. (beat) Yeah, I can't do that though. 
ANNIE Look, I'm really sorry. I promise I will get the lights fixed tomorrow morning. I'm kind of in a hurry. I'm going to my best friend's engagement party, I'm the Maid of honor and so I really - 
RHODES Oh, yeah. My little sister was just in a wedding. She lost some of her hair from the stress. Again, not funny. 
ANNIE Am I getting a ticket? He searches for words. She's cute and he wants to keep her there. He keeps smiling. Awkward silence. 
RHODES Uh, yeah. That's what happens when you break the law. Um...license and registration. 
ANNIE Here. He writes a ticket. 
RHODES (searching for words) Ooo, I like that air freshener. Did you get that at the gas station? 
ANNIE I don't remember. 
RHODES Smells like Christmas. (sniff) Yeah, it smells like Christmas. He rips the ticket off. 
RHODES (CONT'D) Well, here you go. And just so you know it's a just a fix-it ticket. So if you get those lights repaired, you wo't have to pay anything. 
ANNIE Oh, Okay. 
RHODES Whoa, are those moon-pies? 
ANNIE Oh yeah. 
RHODES (mumbling) Oh, those are my favorite. 
ANNIE What? 
RHODES Nothing. (mumbling) Those are my favorite. 
ANNIE Do you want one? 
RHODES No. It's too much trouble, they look all wrapped up. She doesn't get the hint. He really wants one. 
RHODES (CONT'D) Well, have fun at your party. Annie drives off. He watches. 
EXT -THE HUNT CLUB. CHICAGO SUBURB. Annie, a little embarrassed, hands her keys to the valet and grabs the moon-pies. She walks into an elegant country club dining room, lively cocktail party. Music, happy people, etc. She is greeted by Lillia's mom, 
LAURIE. 
LAURIE Annie, sweetheart! 
ANNIE Hi Mrs. Donovan! They hug. 
LAURIE Oh! And you brought your famous moonpies! Laurie takes the tray. 
LAURIE (CONT'D) Can you believe our Lillian? 
ANNIE I know, I'm so happy for her. 
HELEN Thank you. The guest says nothing to Annie and walks away. 
HELEN (CONT'D) Annie, I didn't mean I didn't think you couldn't do it. I'm sure you are aware of all your duties. We'll see--we'll see you soon. Helen walks away. A OLD LADY passes by her. 
WOMAN You're very pretty. 
MEGAN (O.S.) Annie! Megan is running towards her with a piece of paper. 
MEGAN (CONT'D) Annie wait! I wanna give you my numbers. A place just opened up near my house. From 4-7 every weekday, Karaoke, two dollar wings and all you can eat MAN sandwiches if you know what I mean. Annie is nervous, starts biting her nails. 
INT. âSEXY NAIL' NAIL SALON. NEXT DAY. 
NAIL TECHNICIAN Your nail too short for french manicure. 
ANNIE (disappointed) Oh well... 
NAIL TECHNICIAN That's Ok. I fix for you. Make you sexy. 
ANNIE Oh, great! 
INT. HARRINTON'S. DONNA'S OFFICE. LUNCHTIME. 
Donna and Annie are eating lunch in the break-room. 
DONNA And then they put a solution in my eyes to dilate them, which caused temporary blindness and with the loss of my sight, my hearing became bionic. Do you need some help dear? Annie struggles to open a bag of chips but her new ULTRA LONG, french-manicured nail-tips are making it very hard. 
ANNIE No, I got it. 
DONNA'S OFFICE. CONTINUOUS Annie and Donna are doing inventory. Annie gets text. 
ANNIE Sorry... Well, it's official. Lillian set a date. October tenth. Why did I just get a stomach ache. 
DONNA Don't be nervous. It's not all on your shoulders. Doesnt she have other bridesmaids? 
ANNIE Yeah and they've all done this before so I'm feeling a little pressure. I have to make this really nice for Lillian. 
DONNA I wish I could help. Weddings are a lot different now then they were in my day. They look at Donna's wedding picture on her desk. 
ANNIE That dress is beautiful. 
DONNA I still have it. I was hoping my daughter Elizabeth would wear it but when she and Alice had their âceremonyâ they both wanted to wear suits. (beat) Ok, we need two Shannisburg tennis bracelets. Annie struggles to write with her nails. 
ANNIE Oops. Hold on a sec, hard to write... 
DONNA They're very long. 
INT. SEXY NAIL. THAT NIGHT. 
ANNIE Hi. I need to make these shorter. 
NAIL TECHNICIAN No, not sexy! 
ANNIE I know, it's... I can't work with them so long. 
NAIL TECHNICIAN Okay. 7 dollar for file. No more sexy though. 
ANNIE Ok. 
NAIL TECHNICIAN Short nail is ugly. 
ANNIE Alright. 
INT. ANNIE'S BEDROOM. 
Annie looks up different bridesmaid dress shops 
EXT. âOCCASIONZ' BRIDAL SHOP. DAYTIME. 
ANNIE Here it is! 
HELEN Ooh, Occasionz. I'm impressed. 
ANNIE Everyone this is Occasionz, supposedly it's you know, one of the best bridal shops in town, so, that's cool. Oh and also, there's a restaurant inside, so um, I figured, we could maybe have lunch after. So, let's go! She goes to the door. It is locked. She sees a buzzer. 
ANNIE (CONT'D) Oh, I didn't see that. She presses the buzzer. 
VOICE FROM INSIDE Hello? 
ANNIE Hi, we're hear to see some bridesmaids dresses. 
VOICE FROM INSIDE What's your name? 
LILLIAN 
(GIDDY) I have to send my measurements to France. Annie is a little disappointed. 
INT. BRIDESMAIDS DRESS ROOM. 
They all stand in a room stuffed bridesmaids dresses. Lillian's cell phone rings. 
LILLIAN Surprise, surprise. It's my Mom. Mom? Can you hold on a second? She covers the phone and talks to the girls. 
LILLIAN (CONT'D) Start looking at dresses. I'll be right back. I think maybe you guys should decide anyway and pick out something you like since you're the ones wearing it. Cool? (nodding) Have fun! What's up Mom? Ugh! They're booked? Lillian leaves talking to her Mom. 
HELEN Ok ladies, start your (french) engines! Shots of dresses being pulled off of the racks. Fighting for the same dress, shirts coming off, dresses zipped up the back and dresses not fitting, etc. 
INT. ANNIE'S DRESSING ROOM 
Annie loves the dress she has on. She talks to herself in the mirror. 
ANNIE Hi I'm Annie. Can I get a martini? What you mean you need to see I.D.? (giggling) 
FANTASY. UPSCALE PARTY. LIKE AN OVERDRAMATIC PERFUME AD. Annie, in the dress, is talking to the bartender. 
BARTENDER Well, with that dress on you look about... .eleven. 
ANNIE Thank you. Annie laughs. And turns away right into, a GORGEOUS male model in a tuxedo. 
HOT MAN IN TUX Excuse me, you dropped an earring. An UNDERWEAR MODEL appears, in his underwear. 
UNDERWEAR MODEL I'll get it for her. 
MAN IN SURGEONS SCRUBS No I will! 
MAN IN RED BATHING SUIT I'll get it! I'm a lifeguard. Tons of men begin to yell and fight over her. The chaos forces Annie to make a DRAMATIC EXIT from the CASTLE. She runs down the stairs like Cinderella into the forest. They men begin to chase her. She runs through the trees out of breath, she is face to face with a sexy, sweaty, lumberjack, wh's chopping wood. It's CHRISTIAN BALE. 
ANNIE Hi. 
CHRISTIAN BALE Hi. I'm Christian Bale. I'm just chopping some wood, I like to do that between movies. 
ANNIE Hello Christian. They hear the voices of the men from the party screaming for her. 
ANNIE (CONT'D) Oh, Christian! I need a place to hide. 
CHRISTIAN BALE Quick, get inside my muscles. They embrace. 
CHRISTIAN BALE (CONT'D) I love this sash. They look into each others' eyes, just about to kiss and-- 
HELEN Hi Annie! 
INT. ANNIE'S DRESSING ROOM. 
Helen has flung open Annie's dressing room curtain, putting an abrupt end to her fantasy. She is wearing cream colored lingerie, showing off her TOTALLY amazing body. Annie is uncomfortable. 
HELEN Look at your cute little boobies. Ooh, is that the dress you like? 
ANNIE Yeah. I think it will look good on everybody, it has a sash-- 
HELEN A sash? Annie, this isn't the Sound of Music tryouts. 
ANNIE Huh? 
DANA (O.S.) I told you Becca I can't wear strapless! 
BECCA (O.S.) Why not?! Annie and Helen come out to see all the bridesmaids arguing. 
DANA Because, I-- 
LESLIE Why don't you two shut your traps? No one's going to be looking at us. Le's just get the one with the shawl, 'm always freezing at these things anyway. 
MEGAN I gotta say I'm still leaning towards the one that I found. It is a very ugly. 
LESLIE Absolutely not. 
ANNIE Well, what about this one? Everybody stops and looks at Annie. 
ANNIE (CONT'D) I think it would be flattering on everyone and we could totally wear it again. The sash comes in different colors not just this one. 
HELEN Everyone! We can't all have the dress that we want. I've been in a lot of weddings and when choosing a bridesmaid dress, you must ask yourself, âIf invited, would I wear this a dress to...The ACADEMY AWARDS!â 
DANA Ooo, I never thought of it that way. All the girls agree. 
HELEN With that in mind, I say we wear this one. Helen holds up a dress. The girls like it. 
ANNIE Really? 
BECCA And Kevin said he just sold his company for an embarrassing amount of money. But he's totally down to earth. You guys have to meet. I'm texting Kevin right now. 
HELEN I know Mike too. Megan is digging a dead fly out of the butter. 
MEGAN The fly just committed suicide. Death by butter. 
DANA Oh my gosh, if you guys got married you could live out here and see us all the time! 
LESLIE Yeah, and then pop out a couple kids, sit around and talk about nothing while your vagina flaps in the wind like a wet paper towel. 
HELEN (sotto) Oooh, I didn't know we were going to hear that word at lunch today. 
DANA I was set up with Ernie. As soon as I met him, I knew. 
LILLIAN Yeah Annie, you never know. 
ANNIE Yes. 
EXT. HIGHWAY. ANNIE DRIVING BACK 
Annie is lost in thought. She hears. Sirens. 
ANNIE What?! Come on! She pulls over. Officer Rhodes approaches. 
RHODES Well, look who it is. 
ANNIE Oh hi. 
RHODES I see your still driving around with busted tail lights. 
ANNIE I'm sorry, money's been tight and...I forgot(laughing). You're not gonna give me another ticket for that are you? 
RHODES Nah... The reason I pulled you over today, is that--(searching) you were driving too slow. Backing up traffic. 
ANNIE I was? 
RHODES Yep. You were going ten miles under the speed limit. That's a moving violation. It's...underdriving. It's in the books. But, I'm just going to give you a warning this time, but I do have to um...write some stuff down on a piece of paper. He begins to write. Beat. 
RHODES (CONT'D) Man I'm hungry. I'm doing the Master Cleanse. You ever heard of it? 
ANNIE Yeah. 
RHODES Cayenne pepper water for three days now. It's supposed to clean you out, make you feel lighter. It's working. The only problem is I get so hungry. I just want a big slab of ribs. You ever crave that kind of stuff? 
ANNIE Don't talk about cravings right now. I am PMS'ing like crazy. It's taking everything in me not to stop and the store and get like three kit-kats and a bottle of wine. I'm so irritable right now. They stare at each other out of awkwardness. 
ANNIE (CONT'D) Sorry. 
RHODES No, it's OK, I've got three sisters. We had tampons in the pencil drawer. Sometimes my friends and I would say they were cigars and smoke'em. (beat) Okay. I have finished writing down the things I need to write, on this paper. OH! He hands her a business card. 
RHODES (CONT'D) This is a buddy of mine. Owns a body shop in Milwaukee. Might be able to help you out for a good price with those taillights. I'll write my name on here so you can tell him who referred you. 
ANNIE Thanks. 
RHODES That's my name right there. In case you forgot it from last time. It's Nathan Rhodes. 
ANNIE Thanks. Annie. I'll get those fixed. I get paid next week. Bye! She drives off. Rhodes wishes he had been more suave. 
INT. HARRINGTON'S JEWELRY STORE. DAYTIME. 
ANNIE Trust me, I've been in the jewelry business for a long time. Nothing says âI'm sorry for your loss' like a sterling silver money clip. An OLD WOMAN CUSTOMER looks at her stone-faced. 
ANNIE (CONT'D) We also have yo-yos you can engrave. In memory of...um, what's your friend's name? The old woman walks away as Sandy approaches. 
SANDY Paychecks. Here you go Annie. She and Sandy open their checks. 
SANDY (CONT'D) Oh my God, I scored this week. 'm gonna buy Sharita a new Panasonic telephone. It's cordless and has intercom. What about you Annie? 
ANNIE I'm gonna pay for a cream-colored gown that I'll never wear again. 
INT. ANNIE'S BEDROOM 
Annie is on the phone as she gets ready for her date with Mike. 
ANNIE Help me! I can't find anything to wear for my date with Mike tonight. 
LILLIAN I don't know. Shoot, I can't talk now. I'm with Helen and we have a conference call with Lady Lavonia Jean St. Petsois JuJu about my dress. Ugh. I'm so sorry. She's calling! I gotta go. Have fun! Lillian hangs up. Steve walks in. 
STEVE That credit lady called you again. I told her you were at the tailors. 
INT. MINI MART 
Annie is on the phone, looking at the herbal drinks. âCalmâ âFocusâ âSex Appealâ âLeanâ. She finally picks âCalmâ. RHODES appears holding a bag of mini carrots. 
ANNIE Hey, it's me, I just had to tell you about my night. Oh my God. Call me. 
RHODES Annie Walker. I thought I heard your car out there. 
ANNIE Very funny, Officer...Jones? 
RHODES Jones? Oh boy. Guess somebody thought he was a little more memorable than he was. 
ANNIE No. Sorry. I'm a little out of it. I'm not drunk. 
RHODES That's ok. Call me Rhodes. (notices her drink) Trying to get âcalmâ? 
ANNIE Yeah. Recovering from a date. 
RHODES Oh. 
ANNIE Finish your cleanse? 
RHODES Yeah, trying to wean myself back to the really bad foods I like eating. 
EXT - MINIMART. CONTINOUS. 
ANNIE Thanks for the drink. (beat) So are you one of those cops that sits in that same spot everyday and sneaks up on people? 
RHODES A lot of people get up to high speeds on this road. I tell people its better to pay for a ticket than have your family pay for a funeral. 
ANNIE That's a very good point. 
OFFICER RHODES Want a carrot? 
ANNIE Yes. I'm starving. 
CONTINUOUS: They are leaning on the back of his car eating carrots. 
ANNIE (CONT'D) Ew! What is this? Annie pulls out a very dry, warped discolored carrot. 
RHODES Oh, you got the ugly carrot. 
ANNIE The what? 
RHODES There's one in every bag. You should eat it. 
ANNIE No. I think you should eat it. The're your carrots. He goes to eat it. She grabs it out of his hands. 
ANNIE (CONT'D) No, no! Don't eat it! EW!!! She throws it on the ground. 
RHODES Don't litter. He picks it up. 
INT. RHODES' POLICE CAR. 
ANNIE I don't think I've ever wanted to get of out a restaurant faster in my life. 
RHODES Yeah, I don't go on blind dates. It seems unnatural. 
ANNIE I have no idea what am I going to tell my friends who set us up. 
RHODES Just tell her the truth. 
ANNIE Yeah. You're probably right. Now Rhodes and Annie are driving in his police car. 
ANNIE (CONT'D) It's an ok job. It's commission, so it's unpredictable. I don't know, I always wanted to finish my bachelor's but that's kind of financially impossible right now. Plus I'd feel like ninety around all those college students. 
RHODES You know my dad used to say that life is like a hallway of doors. You can stand at the same door forever if you want. Or you can open a different door. And that one may not be the right door, but i'll open up a whole new hallway of doors. Anyway, it worked for me. I was kinda lost and I opened a door and the next thing I knew I was a cop. And I love my job. 
ANNIE Hmm. I think I get it? 
RHODES Or you can always sell moon-pies by the side of the road. 
ANNIE Moonpies. What? 
RHODES It's a joke. You had moon-pies in your car the first time I pulled you over. 
ANNIE Oh yeah. 
INT. FAST FOOD RESTAURANT COUNTER. LATER 
They are waiting in line. 
Annie arrives home from work frazzled to find Steve on the couch watching the same Home Improvement show. 
TV HOST Wow, well I have never seen a transformation like this. This old tour bus is stunning. 
GIRL ON SHOW Thanks. 
STEVE Unbelievable. (to Annie) You got another package from your mom. 
ANNIE Hey thanks for saving my butt today. Like I said I'll pay you back as soon as I can. She opens the package. And pulls out a red blazer. 
STEVE No problem. But you should always put gas in when it gets to a quarter tank. Especially cause you have such a shitty car. 
ANNIE Thanks. Can I ask you a question? What do you think of Vegas? 
STEVE Ooo. Let me turn this off. Vegas is a black hole but I must have it in my life. Does that make sense? 
ANNIE I'm just asking because some of the girls are talking about going for Lillia's bachelorette party and I've never been. 
STEVE Oh no. Now I don't know about weddings. When you go on a bachelorette, does the bride pay? 
ANNIE No, everyone pays for themselves. And you pay for the bride. 
STEVE Ok, I'm gonna say no. You cannot afford that. Vegas is not cheap. Airfare, hotels, food, cars, drinks, clubs, show tickets. Remember this morning? You cannot afford Vegas. 
ANNIE Well, I could save up for it. 
STEVE No, you need to win a contest to go to Vegas/You had gum for lunch yesterday. Ooh, âNight Moves.â Can I have this? A lightbulb goes off in Annie's head. Steve holds the blazer out and reads the tag. 
ANNIE Told you I'd pay you back! Annie runs into her room. She sits down at the computer and begins typing feverishly. We see these words: âDear bridal partyâ, âgreat ideaâ, âbachelorette partyâ, âFloridaâ, âSea World!â, âFree place to stay!â. She presses send, and is very pleased. The phone immediately rings. 
ANNIE (CONT'D) Hello? 
HELEN Hi. 
ANNIE Hi. 
HELEN Hiiiii. 
ANNIE Hi Helen. Helen is dressed in cream under a cream blanket. All around her is a ridiculous amount of white glowing candles. There are too many flames. 
HELEN I just got your e-mail. Um...Sea World? 
ANNIE Well it's not just Sea World. It's a weekend in Florida. See, when Lillian and I were kids we went there and she loved it and has always talked about going back. Ask Dougie. I think it would really mean a lot to her. We could stay at my Dad's house, he won't even be there. Then we could go out at night and got to the beach and then Sea World on one of the days. 
HELEN But a bachelorette at Sea World? 
ANNIE Like I said, Sea World would just be a part of it. 
HELEN Well, I have been talking to the other girls, and I was thinking we should go to Las Vegas! Annie's other line rings. 
ANNIE Oh, can you hold on? That's my other line. She clicks over. 
ANNIE (CONT'D) Hello? 
BECCA Hi, Annie. It's Becca. Becca, in her shabby-chic home office paints a front porch sign that says âThe Whitman'sâ 
BECCA (CONT'D) I was just looking at your e-mail, yo're so cute. Sea World. What about Turkey? That's where we went for for MY bachelorette. 
ANNIE Oh well, Turkey's really far away. 
BECCA It's super old though! They have awesome restaurants. It's very exotic. Have you ever seen Aladdin? It totally looks like that. 
ANNIE Hang on... Annie clicks back over to Helen. 
ANNIE (CONT'D) Helen, I'm sorry can I call you back? 
HELEN When? 
ANNIE Just a few minutes. I'll call you back. Annie clicks over. 
ANNIE (CONT'D) Becca? 
BECCA Hi. You know, if you wanna go some place closer than Turkey. Helen JUST e-mailed me about going to Vegas. 
ANNIE Oh, I don't know. Everybody always goes to Vegas. It seems just cliche to me. 
BECCA I never get sick of it. I love blackjack. I have a system. Annie's other line. 
ANNIE Oh, my other line's ringing. Can I call you back? 
BECCA When? 
MEGAN Here we are. The city of lust. Annie, do you know how many men are looking for trouble in this town right now? We are gonna nail it down. We should tell everybody we're twins cause guys looking up with twins! 
ANNIE Yeah, I've heard that. Ok everybody! You guys, hey we're here, we're in Vegas! Woo! Lillian walks up. 
LILLIAN Annie, come here. Why didn't you tell me you weren't sitting with us? 
ANNIE Oh, it's no big deal. I didn't want to blow all my money on a first class ticket. I'm here though, right?! 
LILLIAN I'm so excited! 
ANNIE Ok, you guys, gather around. Welcome to Lillian's bachelorette party! We should probably get a bunch of cabs and head to our beautiful hotel, The New Marquis Royal Suites... As Annie's talking, a limo pulls up behind her. âThe New Marquis Royal Suites.â 
HELEN Lillian, look what's happening. 
LILLIAN Oh my God. You guys, is this for us?! 
HELEN I got a limo from the hotel. We're in Vegas! Yaaaay!! They all pile into the limo, excitedly talking. 
ANNIE Ok, everyone just get in the car. Got a ride to the hotel. It's taken care of. 
MEGAN (from inside the limo) Sit by me, Annie! 
EXT. THE NEW MARQUIS ROYAL SUITES. LATER 
The girls' excited talking continues into the lobby. 
LILLIAN This hotel is amazing! You guys! 
HELEN Come on Lillian, you're staying with me in the master suite. It's all set. 
LILLIAN Oh! Okay! Then party in room 812 in one hour! (waving her key) 
UPSTAIRS. HOTEL HALLWAY. CONTINUOUS. Girls get off the elevator, giddy with excitement. Annie gets back into the elevator. 
ANNIE Uh! Shoot! I left my sunglasses downstairs. Ugh! Where's my head? 
EXT. HOTEL. CONTINUOUS. 
Annie sneaks out, rolling her bag. She catches a cab. 
EXT. HOTEL RICK. LATER. 
Cab pulls up to a tiny broken down building. A sign reads âHotel Rick. Vacancy. Some T.V.s.â An old man rides a bicycle in circles in the parking lot, smiling. 
INT. HOTEL RICK. CHECK-IN DESK. 
Lobby is very outdated. Wood panel walls etc., The hotel brochure is on the desk. It is probably the picture she saw online, it does NOT look the same. The clerk enters. 
ANNIE Hi, I have a reservation for Walker. RICK, an East Indian man, stands behind the desk in front of a large portrait of himself, posed exactly as he is now, with the same outfit. He holds the pose, smiling. 
RICK Okay, two nights? 
ANNIE Yes. Rick waits for her to notice the painting, but she never does. 
RICK Do you want towels? 
ANNIE Yes. 
RICK Do you need sheets? 
ANNIE Yes. 
RICK No pillow though, ok? Annie just stares at him. 
INT. THE NEW MARQUIS ROYAL SUITES 
The door opens to reveal a gorgeous huge feminine suite. 
HELEN AND LILLIAN (gasp) OH MY GOD! 
INT. HOTEL RICK. ANNIE'S ROOM 
Annie opens her door holding unfolded sheets and towels. The room is very ugly, bare mattress, lots of brown. 
ANNIE Oh my God. 
INT. THE NEW MARQUIS ROYAL SUITES 
Megan and Leslie stand in their grande bathroom. Hot tub, plush towels, flat screen T.V. Candles burning. 
MEGAN Oh my gosh, I can't believe this. 
ANNIE I thought we were going to the Jungle Lounge after this. 
HELEN We are. After that. 
ANNIE Oh...um...wow. Awesome. Here's the thing I was going to stop by the hotel, the Marquis Suites. I think I ate something weird on the plane probably, my stomac's not right. 
HELEN Oh, well we're only gonna be there for an hour or so, you can just meet up with us after. 
ANNIE Okay. Perfect. 
HELEN I'll just text you when we're getting ready to leave. I hope you feel better. Lillian comes up already a little tipsy. 
LILLIAN Ok, Leslie spilled the beans. Le's get our asses over to Sacrifice. What are we waiting for? Wooooooo! Lillian looks at Helen's legs. 
LILLIAN (CONT'D) Whoa whoa. Helen, turn around. Are those those Ransom Jeans? 
HELEN Don't tell Perry I bought them,I ordered them from New York. They're insanely expensive. But I gotta tell you guys the compliments I get on my ass make them worth every penny. She sticks her butt out. Lillian slaps it and all the girls laugh. She is the life of the party. 
EXT. RESTAURANT. CONTINUOUS 
A party bus pulls up. As the doors open, dry ice pours out. Inside there's a disco ball, dance poles, crazy lights. The girls all scream and run onto the bus. With the commotion, no one notices that Annie stays behind. 
INT. CASINO. LATER. 
Annie enters casino alone, sadly weaves through the slot machines. 
INT. PARTY BUS 
âMy Prerogativeâ by Bobby Brown comes on VERY LOUD making conversation difficult. Lillian looks around for Annie. 
LILLIAN Oh my God, Annie our song! Wher's Annie? 
DANA What?! 
LILLIAN Where's Annie?! 
MEGAN I don't know!(to Helen) Where's Annie!

ANNIE HAD REALLY BAD DIARHEA! They continue partying, drinking, dancing. 
INT. CASINO. 
Annie passes four fun college age party guys at a craps table. 
DAVE No, no, no wait. Wait. (to Annie) Hey, will you roll for me? Can she roll for me? 
CRAPS GUY Only if she's playing. 
ANNIE Me? What do I have to roll? 
DAVE Anything but a seven or eleven, as many times as you can. What's your name? 
ANNIE Annie. 
DAVE I'm Dave. This is Brian, Brian and Mark. Ok Annie, do your thing. Annie rolls a four. The guys all cheer.

ANNIE Four! Ahhhhhhhhh! (giddy laughing) 
GUYS Annie! Annie! Annie! Annie gets a text message. 
INT. JUNGLE LOUNGE. 
Annie walks through the club. She calls Lillian. No answer. She gets a a drink. Time passes. Her phone rings! 
LILLIAN Annie! 
ANNIE Hello!? 
LILLIAN Are you ok? 
ANNIE Yeah, I'm fine. I'm here! Where are you?! 
LILLIAN What do you mean here, where? 
ANNIE I'm at the Jungle Lounge, where are you guys? This place is huge! 
LILLIAN You're where? 
ANNIE The club! 
LILLIAN Listen I can't hear you! We had to leave the Jungle Lounge, Becca-- 
ANNIE What?! 
LILLIAN Meet us at the-- 
ANNIE Hello?!! 
INT. PARTY BUS. 
Loud music. Lillian tries to call Annie back. Annie tries to call Lillian back. They both get voice-mails. Annie gives up. It starts pouring rain on her inside the club. Everyone jumps up and screams with excitement. Thunder! 
CLUB D.J. Me Tarzan, you Jane. It's time for the dance spotlight. If it lands on you, you gotta shake it! The spotlight immediately lands on a soaking wet Annie. She dances very angrily. Jungle dancers dance very close to her and put vines around her neck. 
INT. BAR NEXT DOOR 
Annie walks in. 
GUYS Yeah, she's back/ the Roller!/ Yeah! 
DAVE What happened to you? 
ANNIE I don't even know. 
DAVE Roller, I can't stand seeing you like this. (to bartender] Get this fine lady a shot! 
ANNIE I'll have two lemon drops. 
INT BAR. HALF HOUR LATER. Annie and Dave are wasted. 
ANNIE That's what I'm saying. Some people have everything and others have just little bits of things. It's not fair. I don't get it.....I mean I think I hate Helen. 
DAVE I hate Helen. 
ANNIE That is the sexiest think anyon's ever said. 
INT. ANNIE'S ROOM. HOTEL RICK. 
In the dark, Annie and Dave are passionately making out. Knocking things over, etc. 
DAVE I hate Helen. 
NEXT MORNING. ANNIE'S HOTEL ROOM The cat jumps on the bed and meows. Annie opens her eyes to see Dave sleeping. She notices his college tattoo on his arm (tasmanian devil with a lacrosse stick?). 
DAVE Hey. 
ANNIE Hi. Sorry I fell asleep while we were making out. I guess I was pretty tired. 
DAVE Its ok. Sorry I gave you a hickey. 
ANNIE Oh shit. There's a knock at the door. Annie opens it to reveal NICOLE, (20), pretty and sweet. 
NICOLE Is Dave here? 
DAVE Nicole!? Hey, Nic. 
NICOLE This is a surprise. 
Brian 1, Brian 2 and Mark appear in the doorway as well. 
BRIAN 1 Dude, I'm sorry. She made us bring her here. 
DANA By this huge girl. She was a working in the bathroom. I just... I didn't cut in line. I didn't! She chased me! 
BECCA Becca it's over. 
MEGAN Annie, she looked like Popeye. 
BECCA She lives here! She lives in Vegas. 
HELEN You're not going to run into her. Just shut-up about it. 
LILLIAN Guys stop! Please! Annie, I'm so sorry about last night. I feel horrible. I want to hear everything that happened. Tonight, you're not leaving my side. We're hittin' the strip club all of us and we're going to put this shit behind us. Okay?! The girls agree. Dana rubs her arm. 
LESLIE Oh your arm does not still hurt. 
INT. FANCY CASINO SHOPPING MALL. LATER. 
Bridesmaids window shop. Something in a fancy boutique catches Annie's eye, she smiles. Ransom jeans. 
INT. STRIP CLUB. THAT NIGHT 
The ladies sit at the front row tables. 
COCKTAILER What can I get you ladies? 
ANNIE First of all , we're gonna need some ones over here. Here's a hundred. Keep twenty for yourself. 
LILLIAN Oooh, Ann! A siren goes off. 
V.O. Good evening ladies, and welcome to Thunderbird. Our first male entertainer has been roaming the prairie for many, many lonely nights... A horse winnies. Ladies scream. 
V.O. (CONT'D) Here he is...looking for a sweet lady to keep him company under the stars...say hello to Cowboy Ron! A male stripper comes out on a cardboard horse, humping 
'S looking for someone. The room goes wild. 
V.O. (CONT'D) There he is ladies looking for that special woman, looking for his briiide...And I believe the person he's looking for is Lillian Donovan! The girls scream. Lillian mouths to Annie âI'm gonna kill you.â Cowboy Ron takes her up on stage. He puts her in a chair and humps her face. Everyone is cracking up. 
MEGAN Leslie, your missing it. 
LESLIE Don't talk to me. Nobody talk to me. Leslie has her hands on the bare ass of a stripper who is dancing in her face. Stripper #2 appears. 
V.O. Wow, looks like Cowboy Ron has a friend on the prairie and he's lookin' for a lady too. 
LILLIAN (pointing to Annie) Get her! Get her!! 
ANNIE 
NO! NO! Stripper #2 pulls Annie up to the stage, lays her on the ground and simulates sex with her. Standing above her, pulls his chaps off. We see that his balls are not all the way tucked into his g-string. The girls cringe. As he stands above her, in slow motion, we see a bead of sweat leave his balls and fly into Anni's open laughing mouth. She dry heaves. The stripper is oblivious, goes to another girl. Lillian and Annie roll around on the ground laughing. 
EXT. STRIP CLUB. 
Everyone's laughing as they exit the club. 
ANNIE I need some gum. 
BECCA That was disgusting! I'm so glad I'm married. 
MEGAN It was awesome! 
DANA I got a picture of the balls. I got it! 
LESLIE (puts her arm around Annie). You lucky bitch. 
LILLIAN Only you Annie. Hands down, best moment of the weekend. Annie finally feels a part of the group. 
INT. AIRPLANE. DAY. 
Annie walks to first class, everyon's sleeping. She hears Lillian laughing really hard, pointing at pictures in a magazine. 
LILLIAN Oh look, there's your boyfriend. 
HELEN Ew, he's like 65. Ok, look Lillian that's you. 
LILLIAN Oh my God. You know who that actually looks like? Remember when we went to Miami and we had to rent towels-- 
HELEN Ew, at that beach, that weird beach! 
LILLIAN And that lady came up to us wearing that mesh top! 
HELEN She was crazy. Annie sinks. A flight attendant appears. 
FLIGHT ATTENDANT Excuse me. Hi. 
BUTLER Are you a guest of Helen Harris? 
ANNIE Yes. 
BUTLER The shower is one mile away. He hands her a pink lemonade. 
ANNIE I don't have a cup-holder. As she's driving, little pink things start to fly beside her car. 
ANNIE (CONT'D) 
WHAT THE- One flies in her car. They're Rose petals! Annie's shitty car drives down a road covered with Rose petals. At the driveway, she is greeted by a valet in a pink bow-tie and beret. As she reaches for her gift from the passenger seat, another valet opens that door and take it. 
VALET This will be placed in the gift room for you madame. He reaches for the cookies she made, and she stops him. 
ANNIE I'll take those. 
Annie watches the valet drives her car away. When she turns back around, there is a man with a white horse holding out his hand to her. 
HORSEMAN Would you like an assisted ride to the main house? 
ANNIE Do I have to? An annoyed Annie arrives at the house on the horse with the man leading her on foot, holding the cookies. She dismounts. The front door is swung open by two attendants. As she enters the mansion, groups of girls pass by her... 
SHOWER GIRLS This is the most amazing shower 've ever been to/Can you believe this?/What a lucky bride/What a good friend... Helen's house is ALL cream and white with gold. Couches are puffy, etc. Annie walks to the backyard. We hear French standards. Beautiful tables are set. Swans and bunnies milling about. Attendants ready to serve. In the middle of everything stands an eight foot tall round âsignâ that says âLillian and Dougieâ in puffy pink cursive. A waiter offers Annie champagne. She takes it. 
BECCA AND LESLIE(O.S.) Annie! They walk to her. 
LESLIE Do you believe this shit? Annie is still staring at the sign. 
BECCA That's a big cookie huh. 
ANNIE Where? They point to the âsignâ. Annie walks closer to see it is indeed a huge cookie. 
LESLIE See. Sugar cookie. 
Leslie takes a piece off, eats it. 
LESLIE (CONT'D) It's even better if you dip it in the chocolate. REVEAL a glorious four tiered chocolate fountain. Girls are around it dipping strawberries and pieces of the big cookie, laughing. Helen is there taking their praise. Annie is pissed and plops her tupperware of cookies on a nearby table. 
LILLIAN Annieee!!! Lillian runs to her. 
LILLIAN (CONT'D) (under her breath) Can you believe this? 
LAURIE (O.S.) Lillian! 
LILLIAN Coming Mom! I gotta go say hi to my aunts. She leaves and Helen appears out of nowhere again. 
HELEN Hi Annie! 
ANNIE Beautiful party. 
HELEN Oh, it's nothing....so...Just make yourself at home. Enjoy! 
ANNIE Thanks. (under her breath) Asshole. 
HELEN What did you say? 
ANNIE I said I love this shower, and i's amazing. I said all that. Annie leaves. Two hip hop dancers wearing pink berets approach Helen and jam out in her face. 
HELEN OK, not me, NOT ME! The GUESTS. Hip hop dance with the GUESTS! 
'S looking. 
INT-HELENS POWDER ROOM Annie puts lotion her hands. She sees a magazine photo of 
'S face super imposed over them. On the counter is a framed photo of Helen, soft lit, posed with her hand gently 
'S face. She also sees a photo of Helen and Lillian from Vegas on the plane. Happy. As Annie leaves, she runs into her Mom, wh's new hairstyle is a bit overdone. 
ANNIE Mom. Hi! They hug. 
ANNIE (CONT'D) Wow! You look great. 
JUDY Thank you sweetheart. (to herself) I wish Barb could see me now. 
ANNIE Not today Mom. 
JUDY You're right. Well I'm happy to see you! I'll see you out there. I need to wash the horse off my hands. Mom goes into the bathroom. Megan approaches. 
MEGAN Annie, did you see the party favors? 
ANNIE I'm sure they're perfect and amazing. 
ANNIE Are you fucking kidding me? 
JUDY Annie! 
ANNIE 
ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?! 
LILLIAN Annie! What is going on with you? 
ANNIE Nothing have fun at Sea World. 
HELEN Why don't we go in the other room and-- 
ANNIE Shut up you ridiculous person, you a sneaky little cream and white cashmere--. 
HELEN Annie. Everyone I am so sorry, I really don't know what you mean. 
ANNIE I think you do.(laughs) Horses? Sculptures? Posters? Look at this stupid house! This stupid marshmallow puffy furniture! (pointing outside) And look at that cookie! Would you please everyone! Speaking of that cookie. I never got a piece! Annie marches into the back yard. 
ANNIE (CONT'D) (shouting, we see her through the large 
WINDOWS) Did you honestly think 30 women were gonna finish this?! You know what!? 'll help you out! She tries to take down the cookie and struggles with it. We watch her from the house. Fall over with the cookie, she runs over to the chocolate fountain and tries to tip it over, it's obviously too heavy. She tries to empty it with her hands onto the ground. 
ANNIE (CONT'D) Mmmmm. Nothing says friendship like a thousand gallons of hot unsanitary chocolate! Hello swan, are you having fun? Did you enjoy the hip-hop dancers? 
Everyone is watching Annie. She is fighting and punching the air like a crazy person, chasing a swan. A little girl starts crying. Annie walks back through the house, through the crowd holding her chocolate covered hands in the air. 
ANNIE (CONT'D) I actually thought I wanted to be like you...and you and YOU, to be a part of this world. That's not who I am. I make bad choices. I'm broke, I lost my stupid job, I'm thirty two years old and I still answer booty calls. I don't like Mike Donahue cause he () on our date. I have a single black hair that grows out of my chin and I can't wear white t-shirts cause something about my sweat turns the pits yellow! AND you know when we were in Vegas? When you were all staying at your luxury hotel? I was staying at Hotel RICK where got BODY LICE! So Helen, you can have the coveted Maid of Honor title. You can have it all wrapped up in a big pink obnoxious musical box! Because all its brought me is a big pain in my ass. Congratulations! Annie leaves and Lillian runs after her. 
LILLIAN Annie stop! I don't know what's going on. 
ANNIE Well let me fill you in. Ever since you got engaged, my life has turned to shit. 
LILLIAN I'm sorry the the happiest time in my life has brought you so much misery. Do you know how selfish that sounds? 
ANNIE I'm selfish? You're the one that's been so wrapped up in all this. Designer dressed, extravagant hotels, this shower, this is not you! 
LILLIAN This is my wedding and you've made it all about you. 
ANNIE Well at least my friendship's not for sale. This hangs in the air. Annie storms off. Lillian storms back inside. 
HELEN Do you think she still has body lice? 
LILLIAN Anyone else?! Anyone else have something they wanna say to me?! Dana can't contain herself. 
DANA I got my chin done! Becca stands up. 
BECCA Kevin smokes pot! Leslie stands up. 
LESLIE I'm pregnant! Megan stands up. 
MEGAN I took two dogs already. There in the back of my van! 
INT. ANNIE'S CAR. MOMENTS LATER- HIGHWAY. 
Annie is pissed. She sees a squirrel in the road (close up of squirrels big eyes). She tries to avoid it, slams on her breaks and BOOM! Annie is rear-ended! The driver behind her backs up, peels out and drives away. 
ANNIE Thank you! Her car won't start. Trying to keep it together, she grabs her running shoes from the back seat and storms down the highway, trying not to cry. A cop car pulls next to her. I's Rhodes. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
Rhodes is looking under her hood. 
RHODES Well, I can't say I'm surprised. 
ANNIE Yes. Taillights. I know! 
RHODES You should've taken it to my friend- 
ANNIE I KNOW! Yes, you're friend! But I didn't ok?! I didn't get them fixed! I don't-- 
RHODES Whoa. Don't take it out on me. This is your fault. 
ANNIE HE hit ME! 
RHODES You had no taillights! You did't get them fixed! You don't get to blame anyoe else. It's your fault. Annie starts to walk away. 
RHODES (CONT'D) Where you going?! Annie keeps walking. 
RHODES (CONT'D) Oh, you're going to walk fifteen miles?! Another WISE decision! 
WOMAN Is anyone sitting here? 
ANNIE No. The lady sits next to Annie and smiles at her. 
CUT TO: 
INT. COFFEE SHOP. DAY. 
Annie looks in the classifieds. A lot say âcollege degree required.â She looks up and sees TED has walked in. 
TED Hey Annie. 
ANNIE Oh, hey Ted. You're in town. 
TED Yeah, yeah. Listen I'm going out tonight but I should be home around 11, you wanna come over? 
ANNIE Really? Ok, sure. Ted smiles at her. Annie stops herself. 
ANNIE (CONT'D) Wait no. No. No. I don't think I do. Because answering your booty calls and having you kick me out after a night of no-strings-attached sex doesn't feel good. NO girls feel good after that and if they say they do they're LYING. But it's not your fault. Its me. It's me. Have a great life. And you can keep the plant. Annie grabs her stuff and leaves. 
INT. ANNIE'S BEDROOM THAT NIGHT 
She lies on her bed staring at the ceiling. She picks up the phone. 
INT. LILLIAN'S PARENTS HOUSE 
Lillian's phone lights up, it's on silent. She is 
'S names cut out and being placed at different tables. Her mom, Laurie, Helen, and two women argue about the seating chart. Lillian looks distraught. 
BACK TO ANNIE'S BEDROOM Annie sadly hangs up. 
INT. QUAINT BAKERY. DAY 
TIM, the owner is sitting with Annie. 
TIM Well, I can't think of anything else to tell you. Did you have any questions? 
ANNIE No, I think we've covered everything. I'm really excited and thank you. Annie gathers her things. 
ANNIE (CONT'D) I'll see you next Monday. What time do I start? 
TIM Four a.m. Annie is a little surprised. Ti's smiling. 
TIM (CONT'D) You'll get used to it. Annie smiles back. 
ANNIE I won't be late. 
TIM Oh and I wanna try one of those moonpies. 
ANNIE (smiling] Yeah. Ok. 
INT. COLLEGE CAMPUS. 
Annie weaves through the crowded hallway, approaches a window. 
ANNIE Hi, I'm here to inquire about financial aid. Her cell phone rings. 
ADMINISTRATION LADY Take these to the second window. 
ANNIE I'm sorry? Annie's trying to find her phone. 
ADMINISTRATION LADY The second window. 
ANNIE Thanks. It's too late, she looks at her phone. It was Lillian. No message. She doesn't call her back. 
EXT. BILL COZBI'S. EVENING 
Annie gets out of Steve's car. 
INT. BILL COZBI'S. 
BILL Parts and labor, we're lookin' at eight hundred dollars. But with your discount... 
ANNIE Discount? 
RHODES Yeah. Rhodes and I worked out a deal way back when, so, this one's on the house. 
ANNIE Are you serious? 
BILL Yep. I owe him big time. He runs background checks on all the guys my daughter dates. There's been a lot of 'em. 
DANA Well it came out a little mean Helen. 
HELEN Dana who's side are you on? All the girls start yelling. Helen loses control of the car for a split second and drives off the road hitting something. BOOM! The girls scream!!! She pulls over. All the girls are wide eyed and speechless. 
BECCA What was that? 
DANA Did we hit something!? 
HELEN Was it a person? 
ANNIE Guys it's just a flat. I've gotten tons of them. Annie goes to get out of the car. 
BECCA/DANA No!/ Annie don't get out!/ It's pitch dark out. 
HELEN Everybody calm down. I'm calling 911. 
LESLIE You don't call 911 for a flat tire! A huge truck drives by moving their car a little bit. The girls SCREAM! 
ANNIE Guys! We're fine. Helen, put the hazards on. Helen puts them on. 
LESLIE I'm calling AAA. 
BECCA I'm calling Kevin! 
ANNIE Helen, do you have a jack? 
HELEN Probably?! 
DANA What if we get hit just sitting here? Or kidnapped or chased by an animal? 
ANNIE Dana calm down. 
LESLIE Shit! I don't have any service. 
BECCA Me neither! 
DANA Oh my God! We're gonna die... Annie has had enough and gets out. The tire is definitely flat. She opens Hele's trunk, lifts the bottom (wherever the jack is in an Escalade] She goes up to the window. 
INT. HELEN'S ESCALADE. CONTINUOUS. 
ANNIE Everyone's gotta get out, if you want me to fix this. They complain that its dangerous, i's cold, but they do. Annie puts the jack under car. 
LESLIE So, how can I help? 
ANNIE Hold the flashlight. Leslie and Megan watch as Annie pumps the jack. She really does know what she's doing! The car is raising. 
ANNIE (CONT'D) Megan hand me the wrench. Megan hands it to her. Annie starts to unscrew the lug nuts handing them to Megan, with Leslie by her side. Dana and Becca stand with Helen. 
DANA That's pretty cool she knows how to do change a tire. 
BECCA I know. I can't believe she's doing it. Dana and Becca move over to Annie. Helen waits alone. 
HELEN Just don't scratch anything. The girls are all crouched down to watch Annie in awe. 
DANA So what are you doing now? 
ANNIE I'm removing the lug nuts so we can take the tire off. 
BECCA How does that little thing lift the whole car? 
MEGAN It uses hydraulic power. It gives a human being the lifting capacity of 1.5 to three tons. 
LESLIE How do you know this stuff? 
MEGAN I like cars. There's a real artistry to them. 
HELEN Are you guys working or talking? We do't have all night. 
DANA (quickly) Annie is doing the best she can Helen. So why don't you just stand over there and be quiet and wait. 
Everyone's speechless. 
HELEN Excuse me?! Dana stands. She has had it with Helen. 
DANA I said, will you, for once, shut the fuck up!!!?? Dana approaches Helen. The other girls are standing now. 
DANA (CONT'D) Lillian probably left because of you anyway. 
HELEN What!? 
DANA You're so- bossy! You've been acting like you're in charge this whole time! Do't you realize how much pressure sh's under? You know, Lillian did not want to leave her reception in a unicorn-drawn carriage?! She said âThat's not me.â And you ordered it anyway! You've been pushing her this whole time! Annie was right.

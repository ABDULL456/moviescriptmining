GOOD WILL HUNTING 
"GOOD WILL HUNTING" 
by 
Matt Damon & Ben Affleck 
FADE IN: 
EXT. SOUTH BOSTON ST. PATRICK'S DAY PARADE -- DAY 
CUT TO: 
INT. L STREET BAR & GRILLE, SOUTH BOSTON -- EVENING 
The bar is dirty, more than a little run down. If there is ever a cook on duty, he's not here now. As we pan across several empty tables, we can almost smell the odor of last nights beer and crushed pretzels on the floor. 
CHUCKIE Oh my God, I got the most fucked up thing I been meanin' to tell you. 
As the camera rises, we find FOUR YOUNG MEN seated around a table near the back of the bar. 
ALL Oh Jesus. Here we go. 
The guy holding court is CHUCKIE SULLIVAN, 20, and the largest of the bunch. He is loud, boisterous, a born entertainer. Next to him is WILL HUNTING, 20, handsome and confident, a softspoken leader. On Will's right sits BILLY MCBRIDE, 22, heavy, quiet, someone you definitely wouldn't want to tangle with. 
Finally there is MORGAN O'MALLY, 19, smaller than the other guys. Wiry and anxious, Morgan listens to Chuckie's horror stories with eager disgust. 
All four boys speak with thick Boston accents. This is a rough, working class Irish neighborhood and these boys are its product. 
CHUCKIE You guys know my cousin Mikey Sullivan? 
ALL Yeah. 
CHUCKIE Well you know how he loves animals right?  Anyway, last week he's drivin' home... (laughs) 
ALL What? Come on! 
CHUCKIE (trying not to laugh) I'm sorry, 'cause you know Mikey, the fuckin guy loves animals, and this is the last person you'd want this to happen to. 
WILL Chuckie, what the fuck happened? 
CHUCKIE Okay. He's driving along and this fuckin' cat jumps in front of his car, and so he hits this cat-- 
Chuckie is really laughing now. 
MORGAN --That isn't funny-- 
CHUCKIE --and he's like "shit! Motherfucker!" And he looks in his rearview and sees this cat -- I'm sorry-- 
BILLY Fuckin' Chuckie! 
CHUCKIE So he sees this cat tryin to make it across the street and it's not lookin' so good. 
WILL It's walkin' pretty slow at this point. 
MORGAN You guys are fuckin' sick. 
CHUCKIE So Mikey's like "Fuck, I gotta put this thing out of its misery"--So he gets a hammer-- 
WILL/MORGAN/BILLY OH! 
CHUCKIE out of his tool box, and starts chasin' the cat and starts whackin' it with the hammer. You know, tryin' to put the thing out of its misery. 
MORGAN Jesus. 
CHUCKIE And all the time he's apologizin' to the cat, goin' "I'm sorry." BANG, "I'm sorry." BANG! 
BILLY Like it can understand. 
CHUCKIE And this Samoan guy comes runnin' out of his house and he's like "What the fuck are you doing to my cat?!" Mikey's like "I'm sorry" --BANG--" I hit your cat with my truck, and I'm just trying to put it out of it's misery" -- BANG! And the cat dies. So Mikey's like "Why don't you come look at the front of the truck." 'Cause the other guy's all fuckin flipped out about-- 
WILL Watching his cat get brained. 
Morgan gives Will a look, but Will only smiles. 
CHUCKIE Yeah, so he's like "Check the front of my truck, I can prove I hit it 'cause there's probably some blood or something"-- 
WILL --or a tail-- 
MORGAN WILL! 
CHUCKIE And so they go around to the front of his truck... and there's another cat on the grille. 
WILL/MORGAN/BILLY No! Ugh! 
CHUCKIE Is that unbelievable? He brained an innocent cat! 
BLACKOUT: 
The opening credits roll over a series of shots of the city and the real people who live and work there, going about their daily lives. 
We see a panoramic view of South Boston. 
LAMBEAU Find out what? 
STUDENT Who proved the theorem. 
EXT. TOM FOLEY PARK, S. BOSTON -- AFTERNOON 
In the bleachers of the visiting section we find our boys, drinking and smoking cigarettes. Will pops open a beer. The boys have been here a while and it shows. 
Billy sees something that catches his interest. 
BILLY Who's that? She's got a nice ass. 
Their P.O.V. reveals a girl in stretch pants talking to a beefy looking ITALIAN GUY (BOBBY CHAMPA) 
MORGAN Yah, that is a nice ass. 
CHUCKIE You could put a pool in that backyard. 
BILLY Who's she talking to? 
MORGAN That fuckin' guinea, Will knows him. 
WILL Yah, Bobby Champa. He used to beat the shit outta' me in Kindergarten. 
BILLY He's a pretty big kid. 
WILL Yah, he's the same size now as he was in Kindergarten. 
MORGAN Fuck this, let's get something to eat... 
CHUCKIE What Morgan, you're not gonna go talk to her? 
MORGAN Fuck her. 
The boys get up and walk down the bleachers. 
WILL I could go for a Whopper. 
MORGAN (nonchalant) Let's hit "Kelly's." 
CHUCKIE Morgan, I'm not goin' to "Kelly's Roast Beef" just cause you like the take-out girl. It's fifteen minutes out of our way. 
MORGAN What else we gonna do we can't spare fifteen minutes? 
CHUCKIE All right Morgan, fine. I'll tell you why we're not going to "Kelly's." It's because the take-out bitch is a fuckin' idiot. I'm sorry you like her but she's dumb as a post and she has never got our order right, never once. 
MORGAN She's not stupid. 
WILL She's sharp as a marble. 
CHUCKIE We're not goin'. (beat) I don't even like "Kelly's." 
CUT TO: 
INT. M.I.T. HALLWAY -- LATER 
Lambeau, still in his reunion formal-wear, strides down the hallway, carrying some papers. A group of students have gathered by the chalkboard. They part like the red sea as he approaches the board. Using the papers in hand, he checks the proof. 
Satisfied, he turns to the class. 
LAMBEAU This is correct? Who did this? 
Dead silence. Lambeau turns to an INDIAN STUDENT. 
LAMBEAU Nemesh? 
Nemesh shakes his head in awe. 
NEMESH No way. 
Lambeau erases the proof and starts putting up a new one. 
LAMBEAU Well, whoever You are, I'm sure you'll find this one challenging enough to merit coming forward with your identity.  That is, if you can do it. 
INT. CHUCKIE'S CAR, DRIVING IN SOUTH BOSTON -- CONTINUOUS 
The street is crowded as our boys drive down Broadway. They move slowly through heavy traffic, windows down. Chuckie sorts through a large "KELLY'S ROAST BEEF" BAG as he drives. 
MORGAN Double Burger. 
Will holds the wheel for Chuckie as he looks through the bag. 
MORGAN (same tone) Double Burger. 
Chuckie gets out fries for himself, hands Will his fries. 
MORGAN I, I had a Kelly's Double Burger. 
CHUCKIE Would you shut the fuck up! I know what you ordered, I was there! 
MORGAN So why don't you give me my sandwich? 
CHUCKIE What do you mean "your sandwich?" I bought it. 
The fight is messy, ugly and chaotic. Most punches are thrown wildly and miss, heads are banged against concrete, someone throws a bottle. 
In the end, it's our guys who are left standing, while Bobby's friends stagger off. Chuckie and Morgan turn to see Will, standing over the unconscious Bobby Champa, still POUNDING him. 
ANGLE ON WILL: SAVAGE, UGLY, VICIOUS, AND VIOLENT 
Whatever demons must be raging inside Will, he is taking them out on Bobby Champa. He pummels the helpless, unconscious Champa, fury in his eyes. Chuckie and Billy pull Will away. 
The POLICE finally arrive on the scene and having only witnessed Will's vicious attack on Champa, they grab him. 
EXT. SIDEWALK (FULL SPEED) -- CONTINUOUS 
A crowd of onlookers have gathered. Chuckie addresses them. 
CHUCKIE Hey, thanks for comin' out. 
WILL Yeah, you're all invited over to Morgan's house for a complementary fish sandwich. 
The Police slam Will into the hood of a car. 
WILL (to Police) Hey, I know it's not a French cruller, but it's free. 
The cop holding Will SLAMS his [Will's] face into the hood, another cop uses a baton to press Will's face into the car. The look of rage returns to Will's eye. 
WILL Get the fuck off me! 
Will resists. Another cop comes over. Will KICKS HIM IN THE KNEE, dropping the cop. Momentarily freed, Will engages in a fracas with three cops. More converge on Will, who -- though he struggles -- takes a beating. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SEAN'S ROOF -- NIGHT 
Sean sits, exactly as we first saw him, except his tie is now loose and an empty bottle of BUSHMILLS is at his side. He stares out over the City. A MATRONLY LANDLADY comes out of a doorway on the roof. 
LANDLADY Sean? 
Sean doesn't answer. 
LANDLADY Sean? You okay? 
SEAN Yeah. 
A beat. 
LANDLADY It's getting cold. 
After a moment, she retreats back down the stairs. Sean doesn't move. 
DISSOLVE: 
EXT. CHARLES RIVER, ESTABLISHING SHOT -- MORNING 
The morning sun reflects brilliantly off the river. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. COURTHOUSE -- NEXT MORNING 
Will emerges from the courthouse. Chuckie is waiting for him in the Cadillac with two cups of DUNKIN' DOUGHNUTS coffee. He hands one of them to Will. This feels routine. 
CHUCKIE When's the arraignment? 
WILL Next week. 
Chuckie pulls away. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. M.I.T. CAMPUS, ESTABLISHING SHOT -- MORNING 
Students walk to class, carrying bags. More than any other, students seem to be heading into one PARTICULAR CLASSROOM. 
INT. M.I.T. CLASSROOM -- MORNING 
The classroom is even more crowded than last we saw it. Tom takes notes as Lambeau plays along with the excited environment with mock pomposity and good humor. 
LAMBEAU Is it my imagination, or has my class grown considerably? 
Laughter. 
LAMBEAU I look around and see young people who are my students, young people who are not my students as well as some of my colleagues. And by no stretch of my imagination do I think you've all come to hear me lecture. 
More laughter. 
LAMBEAU But rather to ascertain the identity of who our esteemed "The Tech" has come to call "The Mystery Math Magician." 
He holds up the M.I.T. Tech featuring a silhouetted figure, emblazoned with a large, white question mark. The headline reads "Mystery Math Magician strikes again." 
LAMBEAU Whoever you are, you've solved four of the most difficult theorems I've ever given a class. So without further ado, come forward silent rogue, and receive thy prize. 
The class waits in breathless anticipation. A STUDENT shifts his weight in his chair, making a noise. 
LAMBEAU Well, I'm sorry to disappoint my spectators, but it appears there will be no unmasking here today. I'm going to have to ask those of you not enrolled in the class to make your escape now or, for the next three hours be subjected to the mundities of eigenvectors. 
SKYLAR Okay. 
CHUCKIE So, you ladies ah, go to school here? 
LYDIA Yes. 
CHUCKIE Yeah, cause I think I had a class with you. 
At this point, several interested parties materialize. Morgan Billy and Will try, as inconspicuously as possible, to situate themselves within listening distance. A rather large student in a HARVARD LACROSSE sweatshirt, CLARK (22) notices Chuckie. He [Clark] walks over to Skylar and Lydia, nobly hovering over them as protector. This gets Will, Morgan, and Billy's attention. 
SKYLAR What class? 
CHUCKIE Ah, history I think. 
SKYLAR Oh... 
CHUCKIE Yah, it's not a bad school... 
At this point, Clark can't resist and steps in. 
CLARK What class did you say that was? 
CHUCKIE History. 
CLARK How'd you like that course? 
CHUCKIE Good, it was all right. 
CLARK History? Just "history?" It must have been a survey course then. 
Chuckie nods. Clark notices Chuckie's clothes. Will and Billy exchange a look and move subtly closer. 
CLARK Pretty broad. "History of the World?" 
CHUCKIE Hey, come on pal we're in classes all day. That's one thing about Harvard never seizes to amaze me, everybody's talkin' about school all the time. 
CLARK Hey, I'm the last guy to want to talk about school at the bar. But as long as you're here I want to "seize" the opportunity to ask you a question. 
Billy shifts his beer into his left hand. Will and Morgan see this. Morgan rolls his eyes as if to say "not again..." 
CLARK Oh, I'm sure you covered it in your history class. 
Clark looks to see if the girls are impressed. They are not. 
When Clark looks back to Chuckie, Skylar turns to Lydia and rolls her [own] eyes. They laugh. Will sees this and smiles. 
CHUCKIE To tell you the truth, I wasn't there much. The class was rather elementary. 
CLARK Elementary? Oh, I don't doubt that it was. I remember the class, it was just between recess and lunch. 
Will and Billy come forward, stand behind Chuckie. 
CHUCKIE All right, are we gonna have a problem? 
CLARK There's no problem. I was just hoping you could give me some insight into the evolution of the market economy in the early colonies. My contention is that prior to the Revolutionary War the economic modalities especially of the southern colonies could most aptly be characterized as agrarian precapitalist and... 
Will, who at this point has migrated to Chuckie's side and is completely fed-up, includes himself in the conversation. 
WILL Of course that's your contention. You're a first year grad student. You just finished some Marxian historian, Pete Garrison prob'ly, and so naturally that's what you believe until next month when you get to James Lemon and get convinced that Virginia and Pennsylvania were strongly entrepreneurial and capitalist back in 1740. That'll last until sometime in your second year, then you'll be in here regurgitating Gordon Wood about the Pre-revolutionary utopia and the capital-forming effects of military mobilization. 
CLARK (taken aback) Well, as a matter of fact, I won't, because Wood drastically underestimates the impact of-- 
WILL "Wood drastically underestimates the impact of social distinctions predicated upon wealth, especially inherited wealth..." You got that from "Work in Essex County," Page 421, right? Do you have any thoughts of your own on the subject or were you just gonna plagiarize the whole book for me? 
Clark is stunned. 
WILL Look, don't try to pass yourself off as some kind of an intellect at the expense of my friend just to impress these girls. 
Clark is lost now, searching for a graceful exit, any exit. 
WILL The sad thing is, in about 50 years you might start doin' some thinkin' on your own and by then you'll realize there are only two certainties in life. 
CLARK Yeah? What're those? 
WILL One, don't do that.  Two -- you dropped a hundred and fifty grand on an education you coulda' picked up for a dollar fifty in late charges at the Public Library. 
Will catches Skylar's eye. 
CLARK But I will have a degree, and you'll be serving my kids fries at a drive through on our way to a skiing trip. 
WILL (smiles) Maybe. But at least I won't be a prick. (beat) And if you got a problem with that, I guess we can step outside and deal with it that way. 
While Will is substantially smaller than Clark, he [Clark] decides not to take Will up on his [Will's] offer. 
WILL If you change your mind, I'll be over by the bar. 
He turns and walks away. Chuckie follows, throwing Clark a look. 
Morgan turns to a nearby girl. 
MORGAN My boy's wicked smart. 
INT. BOW AND ARROW, AT THE BAR -- LATER 
Arriving at Will's house and dropping him off. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. M.I.T. BUILDING AND GROUNDS GARAGE -- DAY 
Lambeau walks into a small garage facility. The area stores lawn machinery and various tools. An older man, TERRY (58) sits behind the desk reading the BOSTON HERALD sports page. Lambeau has obviously never been here before. He takes in the surroundings, somewhat uncomfortable. Gets dirty. 
LAMBEAU Excuse me. Is this the buildings and grounds office? 
TERRY Yeah, can I help you? 
LAMBEAU I'm trying to find the name of a student who works here. 
TERRY No students work for me. 
LAMBEAU Could you just check, because the young man who works in my building-- 
TERRY Which one's your building? 
LAMBEAU Building two. 
Terry checks a list behind his [own] desk. Looks up. 
TERRY Well, if something was stolen, I should know about it. 
LAMBEAU No, no. Nothing like that. I just need his name. 
TERRY I can't give you his name unless you have a complaint. 
LAMBEAU Please, I'm a professor here and it's very important. 
TERRY Well, he didn't show up for work today... 
Terry takes a beat. Holding all the cards. 
TERRY Look, he got his job through his P.O. so you can call him. 
Terry goes through a stack of paper on his desk. Takes out a card and hands it to Lambeau. Lambeau looks blankly at the card which reads: "PAROLE EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM." 
INT. COURTROOM -- DAY 
Will stands before JUDGE MALONE (40) being arraigned. It is fairly unceremonious, the courtroom nearly empty, save Will and the PROSECUTOR. Lambeau walks in from the back. 
WILL There is a lengthy legal precedent, Your Honor, going back to 1789, whereby a defendant may claim self- defense against an agent of the government where the act is shown to be a defense against tyranny, a defense of liberty-- 
The Judge interrupts to address the prosecutor. 
JUDGE MALONE Mr. Simmons, Officer McNeely who signed the complaint isn't in my courtroom. Why is that? 
PROSECUTOR He's in the hospital with a broken knee, Your Honor. But I have depositions from the other officers. 
WILL Henry Ward Beecher proclaimed, in his Proverbs From Plymouth Pulpit back in 1887, that "Every American citizen is by birth, a sworn officer of the state.  Every man is a policeman." As for the other officers, even William Congrave said; "he that first cries out 'stop thief' is 'oft he that has stolen the treasure." 
PROSECUTOR Your Honor-- 
Will cranks it up. 
WILL (to Prosecutor) I am afforded the right to speak in my own defense by our constitution, Sir.  The same document which guarantees my right to liberty. "Liberty," in case you've forgotten, is "the soul's right to breathe, and when it cannot take a long breath laws are girded too tight.  Without liberty, man is a syncope." (beat, to Judge) Ibid. Your Honor. 
PROSECUTOR Man is a what? 
WILL Julius Caesar proclaimed -- Though he be wounded-- "Magna..." 
The Judge interrupts. 
JUDGE MALONE Son, (a beat) My turn. 
The Judge opens Will's CASE HISTORY. 
JUDGE MALONE (reading) June, '93, assault, Sept. '93 assault... Grand theft auto February 
A beat, the Judge takes particular notice. 
JUDGE MALONE Where, apparently, you defended yourself and had the case thrown out by citing "free property rights of horse and carriage" from 1798... 
Lambeau has to smile, impressed. The Judge shakes his head. 
JUDGE MALONE March, '94 public drunkenness, public nudity, assault. 10/94 mayhem. November '94, assault. Jan. '95 impersonating a police officer, mayhem, theft, resisting -- overturned-- 
The Judge takes a beat. Gives Will a look. 
JUDGE MALONE You're in my courtroom, now and I am aware of your priors. (beat) I'm also aware that you're an orphan. You've been through several foster homes. The state removed you from three because of serious physical abuse. 
The Judge holds a look to Will, who looks down. 
JUDGE MALONE Another Judge might care. You hit a cop, you go in. (beat) Motion to dismiss denied. 
The Bailiff goes to remove Will from the courtroom. 
JUDGE MALONE Keep workin' on your arguments, son. A word of advice for trial; speak English. 
As Will is removed from the courtroom, Lambeau approaches Judge Malone who is stepping down from the bench. 
CHUCKIE You're fuckin' good. 
Will smiles. 
CHUCKIE Just submit, Morgan. He's got you in the Cobra Clutch. 
MORGAN (to Chuckie) Fuck your mother too! 
INT. WILL'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT 
Will sits alone in his one room apartment, reading. A closer look reveals he is reading a self-help PSYCHOLOGY BOOK. Will is flipping through the book at about a page per second. He shakes his head and smiles. Upon finishing the book, he throws it in a nearby WASTEBASKET. Push in on the back of the book where a SMILING PSYCHOLOGIST is pictured. 
INT. PSYCHOLOGIST'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS 
Will sits in a well decorated Psychologist's Office. Across from Will sits the same PSYCHOLOGIST, HENRY LIPKIN (40), from the book. They are in mid-session. 
WILL That's why I love stock-car racin'. That Dale Ernhart's real good. 
PSYCHOLOGIST Now you know Will, and I know, what you need to be doing. You have a gift. 
WILL I could work the pit maybe, but I could never drive like Dale Ernhart-- 
PSYCHOLOGIST You have a quality -- something you were born with, that you have no control over -- and you are, in a sense, hiding that by becoming a janitor. And I'm not saying that's wrong. I'm friends with the janitor that works in my building.  He's been to my house for dinner. As a matter of fact I did some free consultation for "Mike" -- that's not his real name. That's in my book. 
WILL Yeah, I read your book. "Mike" had the same problems as "Chad" the stockbroker. 
PSYCHOLOGIST Yes. The pressures you feel, and again, I am neither labeling nor judging them, are keeping you from fulfilling your potential -- you're in a rut. So stop the Tom Foolery -- the Shenanigan's, Will. 
WILL You're right. I know. 
PSYCHOLOGIST Will, your not getting off that easy. 
WILL No, but, I mean you know... I do other things. That no one knows about. 
PSYCHOLOGIST Like what, Will? 
WILL I go places, I interact. 
PSYCHOLOGIST What places? 
WILL Certain, clubs. (beat) Like, Paradise. It's not bad. 
Will gives the Psychologist a furtive look. 
WILL It's just that feeling when you can take your shirt off and really dance. (beat) When the music owns you. Do you understand? 
PSYCHOLOGIST I might understand that. 
WILL Do you find it hard to hide the fact that you're gay? 
PSYCHOLOGIST What? 
WILL C'mon, I read your book. I talked to you. It's just something I know to be true. 
PSYCHOLOGIST That's very presumptuous. 
WILL Buddy, two seconds ago you were ready to give me a jump. 
PSYCHOLOGIST (a little laugh) Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I'm married and I have two children. 
WILL I'm sure you do. You probably got a real nice house, nice car -- your book's a best seller. 
PSYCHOLOGIST You're getting defensive, Will. 
WILL Look, man. I don't care if you're putting from the rough. There are solid arguments that some of the greatest people in history were gay; Alexander the Great, Caesar, Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde, Napoleon, Gertrude Stein, not to mention Danny Terrio, not many straight men can dance like that. 
PSYCHOLOGIST Who is "Danny Terrio?" 
WILL If you wanna hit "Ramrod," take your shot. Take some pride in it. You go to church? So fuckin' what, God loves you.  I mean, Christ. A guy as well known as you? By the time you put your disguise on and skulk out of the house Sunday nights you probably look like "Inspector Clouseau." 
The Psychologist calmly packs his things. 
PSYCHOLOGIST Well, I can see this is pointless... 
WILL You're getting defensive... Henry. And hey, chief -- tell the wife, at least.  Christ, set her free. 
The shrink gets up and walks out. 
WILL Fuckin' hypocrite... 
INT. HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS 
The Psychologist comes walking out, much to the surprise of Lambeau and Tom who have been waiting in the lobby. 
LAMBEAU Henry? 
The Psychologist keeps walking. 
PSYCHOLOGIST No. You know what, Gerry? This is why I don't do pro-bono anymore. It's not worth it to me. 
LAMBEAU What happened? 
PSYCHOLOGIST I don't have the time. I'm going on national television this week. 
INT. LAMBEAU'S OFFICE -- LATER 
Will is reclining, eyes closed, in a trance-like state. The mood is more serious now. 
HYPNOTIST Okay, you're in your bed, Will. Now how old are you? 
WILL Seven. 
HYPNOTIST And what do you see? 
WILL Somethin's in my room. 
HYPNOTIST What is it? 
WILL It's like a small figure, hoverin' over me. Gettin' closer. 
Will flinches. 
HYPNOTIST You're in a safe place, Will. 
WILL It's touching me. 
Lambeau makes a sound. The Hypnotist shushes him [Lambeau] with his [Hypnotist's] finger. Tom returns to his note-taking. 
HYPNOTIST Where is it touching you? 
WILL Down there. (indicating genitals) And I'm nervous. 
HYPNOTIST You don't have to be nervous, Will. 
Lambeau and the Therapist trade looks. This is working. 
WILL 'Cause I'm not ready. (calming) But the figure tells me everything's gonna be all right. 'Cause the figure's a Libra too. And we start dancin' and it's beautiful-- 
Will breaks into song at full volume. 
WILL "SKY ROCKETS IN FLIGHT!" 
LAMBEAU (getting up) Oh Jesus. 
The Hypnotist gets up and starts heading towards the door. Will is still singing from "Sky Rockets." 
LAMBEAU Wait a minute, Barry. 
HYPNOTIST I have better ways to spend my time. 
He is gone. Will stops singing, laughs. 
LAMBEAU Oh, for God's sake, Will. 
WILL Oh, come on! You're not pinnin' this one on me. He left, I wanted to talk to him for another twenty minutes. I was havin' fun. 
LAMBEAU I told you to cooperate with these people. 
WILL C'mon, that guy was a fuckin' piece of work. 
Will gets up and adopts a hypnotic persona in front of Lambeau. 
WILL (spooky voice) Look into my eyes. I don't need therapy. 
LAMBEAU Get out, Will. 
WILL Okay... don't forget to get another therapist for next week. 
LAMBEAU That's enough. 
Will is out the door. Lambeau turns to Tom. 
TOM I called Mel Weintraub this morning, to check for availability. 
LAMBEAU What's the point? 
TOM What do you want to do? 
LAMBEAU There is somebody... 
TOM Who is he? 
LAMBEAU He was my roommate in college. 
INT. BUNKER HILL CAMPUS -- DAY 
This is SEAN MAGUIRE'S "Dying and Bereavement" class. Emblazoned on the door is "room 101." While the lecture hall could hold sixty students, there are less than fifteen here today. 
Sean Maguire lectures to the class in a resigned tone. Tired of teaching, tired of life, he finds himself resigned to the tedium of teaching core classes to an indifferent student body. 
SEAN Establishing trust is the most important component in making breakthroughs with a patient. Why? 
A beat. 
SEAN Maureen? 
MAUREEN'S only response is an empty stare. 
WILL 'Course I do, they're my brothers. 
SKYLAR Well... 
WILL Marky, Ricky, Danny, Terry, Mikey, Davey, Timmy, Tommy, Joey, Robby, Johnny, and Brian. 
SKYLAR (laughing) Do you keep in touch with them? 
WILL All the time. We all live in Southie. I live with three of them now. 
Skylar smiles. 
SKYLAR I want to meet them. 
WILL We'll do that. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SEAN'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT 
As we pan across Sean's small apartment, we find it strewn with dirty clothes and the sink full of dishes. Although, if it weren't for the clutter, the place would feel pretty bare. A framed SPORTS ILLUSTRATED cover featuring a screaming Larry Bird and entitled "CELTIC PRIDE" hangs on the wall. Sean sits at the table next to another nearly empty bottle of BUSHMILL'S IRISH WHISKEY. He is deep in thought. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- DAY 
Will strolls into the office. Sean is waiting there behind his desk. He seems different. More calm. Will and Sean stare at each other for a long moment. 
WILL You again. How the paintin' coming? 
Sean stands up. 
SEAN Come with me. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. BOSTON COMMON -- MINUTES LATER 
Sean and Will sit in the bleachers at the mostly empty park. 
They look out over a small pond, in which a group of schoolchildren on a field trip ride the famous Swan Boats. 
WILL So what's with this place? You have a swan fetish? Is this something you'd like to talk about? 
SEAN I was thinking about what you said to me the other day, about my painting. I stayed up half the night thinking about it and then something occurred to me and I fell into a deep peaceful sleep and haven't thought about you since. You know what occurred to me? 
WILL No. 
SEAN You're just a boy. You don't have the faintest idea what you're talking about. 
WILL Why thank you. 
SEAN You've never been out of Boston. 
WILL No. 
SEAN So if I asked you about art you could give me the skinny on every art book ever written... Michelangelo? You know a lot about him I bet. Life's work, criticisms, political aspirations. But you couldn't tell me what it smells like in the Sistine Chapel. You've never stood there and looked up at that beautiful ceiling. And if I asked you about women I'm sure you could give me a syllabus of your personal favorites, and maybe you've been laid a few times too. But you couldn't tell me how it feels to wake up next to a woman and be truly happy. If I asked you about war you could refer me to a bevy of fictional and non-fictional material, but you've never been in one. You've never held your best friend's head in your lap and watched him draw his last breath, looking to you for help. And if I asked you about love I'd get a sonnet, but you've never looked at a woman and been truly vulnerable. Known that someone could kill you with a look. That someone could rescue you from grief. That God had put an angel on Earth just for you.  And you wouldn't know how it felt to be her angel. To have the love be there for her forever. Through anything, through cancer. You wouldn't know about sleeping sitting up in a hospital room for two months holding her hand and not leaving because the doctors could see in your eyes that the term "visiting hours" didn't apply to you. And you wouldn't know about real loss, because that only occurs when you lose something you love more than yourself, and you've never dared to love anything that much. I look at you and I don't see an intelligent confident man, I don't see a peer, and I don't see my equal. I see a boy. Nobody could possibly understand you, right Will? Yet you presume to know so much about me because of a painting you saw.  You must know everything about me.  You're an orphan, right? 
Will nods quietly. 
SEAN Do you think I would presume to know the first thing about who you are because I read "Oliver Twist?" And I don't buy the argument that you don't want to be here, because I think you like all the attention you're getting. Personally, I don't care. There's nothing you can tell me that I can't read somewhere else.  Unless we talk about your life. But you won't do that. Maybe you're afraid of what you might say. 
Sean stands, 
SEAN It's up to you. 
And walks away.

INT. CONSTRUCTION SITE -- DAY 
Will and Chuckie doing demo at the site. They throw cinderblocks out a window into a pile. They are filthy. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SOUTH BOSTON STREET -- NIGHT 
Rain pounds South Boston. Chuckie sits with the Cadillac fiddling, humming to the radio. Morgan and Billy sit in the back, sharing a case of beer. Will is at a pay phone. 
INT. SKYLAR'S ROOM -- NIGHT 
SKYLAR Hello? 
Will hangs up and runs back to the car, soaked. 
CHUCKIE Who'd you call? 
WILL No one. I didn't have the number. 
MORGAN What are you, retarded? You went all the way out there in the rain and you didn't have the number? 
WILL No, it was your mother's 900 number. I just ran out of quarters. 
WILL I'm takin' off. 
ALL We're goin' late night. 
WILL I'm tired. 
CUT TO: 
INT. LAMBEAU'S OFFICE -- DAY 
Will and Lambeau work together at the board. They communicate non-verbally as they collaborate on a problem. After a particularly amusing series of numbers, they share a look and laugh. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- DAY 
Will and Sean sit in silence. A long moment passes. Sean casually reclines in his chair, disinterested. Will restlessly looks around the room and then back to Sean. An odd half smile crosses Sean's face. After a moment: 
WILL You know, I was on this plane once. And I'm sittin' there and the captain comes on and is like "we'll be cruising at 35,000 feet," and does his thing, then he puts the mike down but forgets to turn it off. Then he says "man, all I want right now is a blow-job and a cup of coffee."  So the stewardess goes runnin' up towards the cock-pit to tell him the mike's still on, and this guy in the back of the plane goes "don't forget the coffee!" 
SEAN (smiles) You've never been on a plane. 
WILL I know, but the joke's better if I tell it in the first person. 
A beat. 
WILL I have been laid you know. 
Sean smiles. 
SEAN Yeah? You got a lady now? 
WILL Yeah, I went on a date last week. 
SEAN How'd it go? 
WILL Fine. 
SEAN Well, are you going out again? 
WILL I don't know. 
SEAN Why not? 
WILL Haven't called her. 
SEAN Jesus Christ, you are an amateur. 
WILL I know what I'm doing. She's different from the other girls I met. We have a really good time. She's smart, beautiful, fun... 
SEAN So Christ, call her up. 
WILL Why? So I can realize she's not so smart. That she's boring. You don't get it. Right now she's perfect, I don't want to ruin that. 
SEAN And right now you're perfect too. Maybe you don't want to ruin that. 
Will says nothing. 
SEAN Well, I think that's a great philosophy Will, that way you can go through your entire life without ever having to really know anybody. 
Sean looks directly at Will, who looks away. A beat. 
SEAN My wife used to turn the alarm clock off in her sleep. I was late for work all the time because in the middle of the night she'd roll over and turn the damn thing off. Eventually I got a second clock and put it under my side of the bed, but it got to where she was gettin' to that one too. She was afraid of the dark, so the closet light was on all night. Thing kept me up half the night.  Eventually I'd fall asleep, out of sheer exhaustion and not wake up when I was supposed to cause she'd have already gotten to my alarms. 
Will smiles, Sean takes a beat. 
SEAN My wife's been dead two years, Will. And when I think about her, those are the things I think about most. Little idiosyncrasies that only I knew about.  Those made her my wife. And she had the goods on me too. Little things I do out of habit. People call these things imperfections Will. It's just who we are. And we get to choose who we're going to let into out weird little worlds. You're not perfect. And let me save you the suspense, this girl you met isn't either. The question is, whether or not you're perfect for each other. You can know everything in the world, but the only way you're findin' that one out is by giving it a shot. You sure won't get the answer from an old fucker like me. And even if I did know, I wouldn't tell you. 
Will smiles. A beat. 
WILL Why not? You told me every other fuckin' thing. You talk more than any shrink I ever met. 
Sean laughs. 
SEAN I teach this shit, I didn't say I knew how to do it. 
WILL You ever think about gettin' remarried? 
SEAN My wife's dead. 
WILL Hence, the word remarried. 
SEAN My wife's dead. 
WILL Well I think that's a wonderful philosophy, Sean. That way you can go through the rest of your life without having to really know anyone. 
A beat. Sean smiles. 
SEAN Time's up. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SKYLAR'S DORM -- AFTERNOON 
WILL You don't regret meetin' your wife? 
SEAN Why? Because of the pain I feel now? I have regrets Will, but I don't regret a singel day I spent with her. 
WILL When did you know she was the one? 
SEAN October 21, 1975. Game six of the World Series. Biggest game in Red Sox history, Me and my friends slept out on the sidewalk all night to get tickets. We were sitting in a bar waiting for the game to start and in walks this girl.  What a game that was. Tie game in the bottom of the tenth inning, in steps Carlton Fisk, hit a long fly ball down the left field line. Thirty-five thousand fans on their feet, screamin' at the ball to stay fair. Fisk is runnin' up the baseline, wavin' at the ball like a madman. It hits the foul pole, home run. Thirty-five thousand people went crazy. And I wasn't one of them. 
WILL Where were you? 
SEAN I was havin' a drink with my future wife. 
WILL You missed Pudge Fisk's homerun to have a drink with a woman you had never met? 
SEAN That's right. 
WILL So wait a minute. The Red Sox haven't won a World Series since nineteen eighteen, you slept out for tickets, games gonna start in twenty minutes, in walks a girl you never seen before, and you give your ticket away? 
SEAN You should have seen this girl. She lit up the room. 
WILL I don't care if Helen of Troy walked into that bar! That's game six of the World Series! 
Sean smiles. 
WILL And what kind of friends are these? They let you get away with that? 
SEAN I just slid my ticket across the table and said "sorry fellas, I gotta go see about a girl." 
WILL "I gotta go see about a girl"? What did they say? 
SEAN They could see that I meant it. 
WILL You're kiddin' me. 
SEAN No Will, I'm not kiddin' you. If I had gone to see that game I'd be in here talkin' abouta girl I saw at a bar twenty years ago. And how I always regretted not goin' over there and talkin' to her. I don't regret the eighteen years we were married. I don't regret givin' up counseling for six years when she got sick. I don't regret being by her side for the last two years when things got real bad. And I sure as Hell don't regret missing that damn game. 
A beat. Will is impressed. 
WILL Would have been nice to catch that game though. 
SEAN (breaking) Well hell, I didn't know Pudge was gonna hit the home run. 
They laugh. 
TIME DISSOLVE TO: 
INT LAMBEAU'S OFFICE -- DAY 
The office is more crowded than usual. TOM and THREE of LAMBEAU'S COLLEAGUES including the esteemed ALEXANDER PEKEC are in the room. Will sits at a work-station which projects a proof of his [Will's] onto the chalkboard. Lambeau stands beside the projected image at the board arguing with Pekec, a foreign mathematician. The image is of a Ramses graph binary tree. 
LAMBEAU Alexander, I know your theory. The boy is updating, he's strategy stealing... 
PEKEC With a Ramses graph on the binary tree-- 
LAMBEAU --But what he's doing, he's attaching an edge to the adjacent vertex. He can always failsafe to either side-- 
PEKEC Maker can. This is not new, Gerry! 
Pekec starts writing lines beside Will's proof on the board. 
PEKEC But I can always garbage out (writes frantically) All the way to "N" to the minus one. 
LAMBEAU No, there's a limit. 
PEKEC The limit is not found! (turns to Will) The limit is not found. 
WILL But I can always go to the other side. 
PEKEC There is no proof-- 
Lambeau can no longer contain himself. 
LAMBEAU Maker builds "K" to the "N." N is three to the K times-- 
PEKEC --But-- 
WILL Look, I wrote it down. 
They turn to Will who places his proof on the projector. The image is cast over their faces. It reads: 
As Pekec reads and the realization dawns on him: 
WILL It's just simpler this way. 
Lambeau turns with satisfaction to an understanding Pekec. 
LAMBEAU Alexander, your theory is changed.

EXT. L STREET BAR & GRILLE -- LATER 
Everyone is walking out, saying good-bye. Chuckie goes over to Will and Skylar. 
CHUCKIE I'm glad you came by, changed my opinion of Harvard people. 
SKYLAR See ya' Chuckie. I had fun. 
Chuckie heads towards Will to say goodnight. 
WILL I don't know what the fuck you're doin'.  You're givin' us a ride. 
CHUCKIE What do I look like, Al Cowlins? (seriously) You want to take my car, drop her off? 
WILL I was countin' on it. 
MORGAN Chuck, let's go. 
CHUCKIE You're walkin' bitch, Will's takin' the car. 
Morgan mumbles something and staggers off. Billy follows with an indifferent shrug. 
WILL Thanks, Chuck. 
CHUCKIE Don't get too slap-happy, you're takin' me home first. 
WILL I don't know, Chuck. It's kinda outta the way. 
CHUCKIE Just 'cause you don't have to sleep in the one room palace, don't start thinkin' you're bad. 
SKYLAR (to Will) I thought you said you'd show me your place. 
WILL Not tonight. 
CHUCKIE Yeah, not tonight. Not any other night. 
He knows, once you see that shit-hole he's gettin' dropped like a bad habit. 
SKYLAR I wanted to meet your brothers... 
Chuckie gives Will a curious look. 
WILL They're all sleepin' now. (a beat, to Chuckie) Let me get those keys. 
CUT TO: 
INT. FACULTY CLUB -- NIGHT 
A cocktail party is underway. Professors mingle with 
representatives from high tech companies. Lambeau stands holding a drink and surrounded by several RECRUITERS. Apparently he's the star of the show. 
RECRUITER #1 What I want to know, Gerry, is when we get to meet this wonder-boy. 
LAMBEAU We're still working together, the boy's a little rough. 
RECRUITER #2 We've got our share of eccentric geniuses at Tri-tech. We know how to deal with that. 
RECRUITER #3 I think we all do. 
Laughter. 
RECRUITER #1 If you're not exaggerating, Gerry-- 
LAMBEAU Was I exaggerating in nineteen eighty- four when I told you I'd win the Field's medal within two years? 
More laughter. 
RECRUITER #1 In that case the boy could run shipping for us, routing-- 
RECRUITER #2 You say he doesn't have a diploma, but we'll 
RECRUITER #1 I don't need to see a driver's license.  I can think of three departments right now that he could head up for us. 
LAMBEAU At ease, gentlemen. We're looking carefully at all our options. 
RECRUITER #3 All right, Gerry. Close to the vest. (gives him his card) Good luck with these vultures. 
He walks off. 
CUT TO: 
INT. TIMMY'S TAP -- DAY 
Timmy's Tap is a local watering hole, not unlike the L Street Bar. Sean is at the bar, telling a joke to TIMMY (45) the owner of the place, and several other REGULARS. 
SEAN So she goes runnin' up the aisle and I figure "fuck it" and I yell out "don't forget the coffee! 
The men erupt in laughter. MARTY, one of the regulars pipe up. 
MARTY Bullshit! You didn't say that! 
Timmy and Sean exchange a look. 
LAMBEAU No, Sean. This boy has that gift. He just hasn't got the direction. We can give that to him. 
A beat. 
SEAN He married his cousin. 
LAMBEAU Who? 
SEAN Einstein. Had two marriages, both trainwrecks.  The guy never saw his kids, one of whom, I think, ended up in an asylum- possible Unabomber addition-- 
LAMBEAU You see, Sean? That's exactly not the point. No one remembers that. They-- 
SEAN I do. 
LAMBEAU Well, you're the only one. 
Beat. 
LAMBEAU This boy can make contributions to the world. We can help him do that. 
SEAN Just... take it easy, Gerry. 
LAMBEAU Look, I don't know what else I can say.  I'm not sitting at home every night, twisting my mustache and hatching a plan to ruin the boy's life. But it's important to start early. I was doing advanced mathematics at eighteen and it still took me twenty-three years to do something worthy of a Field's medal. 
SEAN Maybe he doesn't care about that. 
A beat. 
LAMBEAU Sean, this is important. And it's above personal rivalry-- 
SEAN Now wait a minute, Gerry-- 
LAMBEAU No, no you hear me out, Sean. This young man is a true prodigy-- 
SEAN Personal rivalry? I'm not getting back at you. 
LAMBEAU Look, you took one road and I took another. That's fine. 
SEAN Is it Gerry? 'Cause I don't think it's fine with you. Give him time to figure out what he wants. 
LAMBEAU That's a wonderful theory, Sean. It worked wonders for you. 
A beat. Lambeau gets up. 
LAMBEAU Sean, I came here today out of courtesy.  I wanted to keep you in the loop. As we speak the boy is in a meeting I set up for him over at Tri-tech. 
CUT TO: 
INT. TRI-TECH LABORATORIES, OFFICE -- SAME 
Three well dressed TRI-TECH EXECUTIVES sit around a conference table, which is littered with promotional brochures. The executives exchange a confused look. One of them speaks. 
EXECUTIVE (tentative) Well, Will, I'm not exactly sure what you mean, we've already offered you a position.. 
Cut to reveal: Chuckie sitting across from the executives, hair combed down, wearing his Sunday best. 
CHUCKIE Since this is obviously not my first time in such altercations, let me say this: 
Chuckie rubs the tips of his fingers together, indicating "cash." The executives are baffled. 
CHUCKIE Look, we can do this the easy way or the hard way. 
The executives are completely blank. 
CHUCKIE At the current time I am looking at a number of different fields from which to disseminate which offer is most pursuant aid to my benefit. (a beat) What do you want? What do I want? What does anybody want? Leniency. 
EXECUTIVE I'm not sure-- 
CHUCKIE --These circumstances are mitigated. Right now. They're mitigated. 
Chuckie puts his hands up, as if getting a vibe from the room. 
EXECUTIVE Okay... 
Chuckie points to the third executive. 
CHUCKIE He knows what I'm talking about. 
The third executive is baffled. 
CHUCKIE A retainer. Nobody in this town works without a retainer. You think you can find someone who does, you have my blessin'. But I think we all know that person isn't going to represent you as well as I can. 
EXECUTIVE Will, our offer starts you at eighty- four thousand a year, plus benefits. 
CHUCKIE Retainer... 
EXECUTIVE You want us to give you cash right now? 
CHUCKIE Allegedly, what I am saying is your situation will be concurrently improved if I had two hundred sheets in my pocket right now. 
The executives exchange looks and go for their wallets. 
EXECUTIVE I don't think I... Larry?

INT. CHUCKIE'S APARTMENT -- DAY 
Chuckie sits on his couch, watching cartoons in his boxers and a tee-shirt, eating cereal. The doorbell rings. He sits. 
CHUCKIE Get it, ma! 
She doesn't. He gets up. Opens door. It's Skylar. 
CHUCKIE (surprised) Hey. 
SKYLAR Hi. 
CHUCKIE How you doin'? 
SKYLAR Good. 
An awkward beat. 
CHUCKIE How'd you know where to find me? 
SKYLAR (smiles) You were the only Sullivan in the phone book. 
Chuckie smiles. 
SKYLAR Will and I dropped you off here, remember? 
CHUCKIE Oh, right. 
SKYLAR This is your house, right? 
Chuckie nods and is about to respond when he is interrupted by a nagging shriek from his mom. 
CHUCKIE'S MOM (O.S.) Get in here, Chuckie! 
CHUCKIE (calling back) Pipe down, Ma! 
SKYLAR I guess so. 
CHUCKIE What? No. This is my mother's house. I don't live with my mother. I just stop by, help out. I'm good like that. 
SKYLAR Is this a bad time? 
CHUCKIE She'll live. (beat) If she starts yelling again I might have to run in real quick and beat her with the stick again but... 
SKYLAR Okay. 
CHUCKIE Let's take a walk. 
EXT. CHUCKIE'S STREET -- DAY 
Chuckie, still in his boxers walks with Skylar who is talking. 
SKYLAR See, now this doesn't feel right. (beat) When I made the decision to come over here it felt right. I had all these rationalizations... I just don't understand why Will never tells me anything, he won't let me get close to him, he tells me these weird lies-- 
CHUCKIE You caught that, huh? 
SKYLAR I just wanted to find out what was going on... But now that I'm here it seems strange, doesn't it? 
CHUCKIE Well, I don't have no trousers on... 
She laughs. A beat. 
CHUCKIE I know why you're here. Will don't talk much. 
SKYLAR I don't care what his family's like or if he doesn't have any brothers, but he doesn't have to lie to me. 
CHUCKIE I really don't know what to say. Look, I lie to women all the time. That's just my way. (beat) Last week Morgan brought these girls down from Roslindale. I told them I was a cosmonaut. They believed me. But Will's not usually like that-- 
MAN ON PORCH Put some clothes on, Sullivan! 
CHUCKIE Take it easy father! 
She laughs. 
CHUCKIE All I can say is; I known Will a long time -- And I seen him with every girl he's ever been with. But I've never seen him like this before, ever with anyone, like how he is with you. 
SKYLAR Is that true? 
CHUCKIE Yeah, it is. 
CUT TO: 
INT. LAMBEAU'S OFFICE -- DAY 
Tom and Will are sitting waiting for Lambeau. 
TOM 
WILL 
Lambeau enters going over a thick proof Will has completed. 
SKYLAR Well, what aren't you scared of? You live in your safe little world where nobody challenges you and you're scared shitless to do anything else-- 
WILL Don't tell me about my world. You're the one that's afraid. You just want to have your little fling with the guy from the other side of town and marry-- 
SKYLAR Is that what you think-- 
WILL some prick from Stanford that your parents will approve of. Then you'll sit around with the rest of the upper crust kids and talk about how you went slummin' too. 
SKYLAR I inherited that money when I was thirteen, when my father died. 
WILL At least you have a mother. 
SKYLAR Fuck you! You think I want this? That money's a burden to me. Every day I wake up and I wish I could give that back.  I'd give everything I have back to spend one more day with my father. But that's life. And I deal with it. So don't put that shit on me. You're the one that's afraid. 
WILL What the fuck am I afraid of?! 
SKYLAR You're afraid of me. You're afraid that I won't love you back. And guess what?  I'm afraid too. But at least I have the balls to it give it a shot. At least I'm honest with you. 
WILL I'm not honest? 
SKYLAR What about your twelve brothers? 
WILL Oh, is that what this is about? You want to hear that I don't really have any brothers? That I'm a fuckin' orphan? Is that what you want to hear? 
SKYLAR Yes, Will. I didn't even know that? 
WILL No, you don't want to hear that. 
SKYLAR Yes, I do, Will. 
WILL You don't want to hear that I got cigarettes put out on me when I was a little kid. That this isn't surgery. 
Will lifts his shirt, revealing a six inch SCAR on his torso. 
WILL You don't want to hear that. Don't tell me you want to hear that shit!! 
SKYLAR Yes I do. Did you ever think that maybe I could help you? That maybe that's the point, that we're a team? 
WILL What, you want to come in here and save me? Is that what you want to do? Do I have a sign that says "save me" on my back? 
SKYLAR I don't want to "save" you. I just want to be with you. I love you. I love you! 
Will, full of self-loathing, raises his hand to strike her. 
WILL Don't bullshit me! Don't fuckin' bullshit me! 
SKYLAR (standing up to him) You know what I want to hear?  I want to hear that you don't love me. If you tell me that, then I'll leave you alone. I won't ask any questions and I won't be in your life. 
A beat. Will looks Skylar dead in the eye. Lowers his hand. 
WILL I don't love you. 
He walks out.

CUT TO: 
INT. NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY, OFFICE -- DAY 
Will sits across from two N.S.A. AGENTS, OLIVER DYTRESS and ROBERT TAVANO. These guys are smug, clean cut, gung-ho and looking sharp in twin navy blue suits. 
WILL So why do you think I should work for the National Security Agency? 
DYTRESS Well, you'd be working on the cutting edge. You'd be exposed to the kind of technology you couldn't see anywhere else because we've classified it. Super string theory, Chaos Math, Advanced algorithms-- 
WILL Codebreaking. 
DYTRESS That's one aspect of what we do. 
WILL Come on, that's what you do. You handle more than eighty percent of the intelligence workload. You're seven times the size of the C.I.A. 
DYTRESS That's exactly right, Will. So the question as I see it isn't "why should you work for N.S.A." it's "why shouldn't you?" 
WILL Why shouldn't I work for the National Security Agency? That's a tough one. 
Will bites his tongue, trying to make this work. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CHUCKIE'S HOUSE -- DAY 
Chuckie, Billy, and Will sit in the Sullivan kitchen. Billy cracks open a beer and Chuckie reads the sports page. Both boys are smoking. Will drinks a beer, distractedly. We hear the faint music track and soft moans of a PORNO MOVIE emanating from a back room. After a beat, Chuckie looks up. 
CHUCKIE Morgan, if you're watchin' pornos in my mom's room again I'm gonna give you a fuckin' beatin'! 
After a beat, Morgan comes out of the back room, red-faced. 
MORGAN (innocently) What's up guys? 
CUT TO: 
INT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- NIGHT 
Will sits across from Sean. 
SEAN So you might be working for Uncle Sam. 
WILL I don't know. 
SEAN Gerry says the meeting went well. 
WILL I guess. 
SEAN What did you think? 
WILL What did I think? 
A beat. Will has obviously been stewing on this. 
WILL Say I'm working at N.S.A. Somebody puts a code on my desk, something nobody else can break. So I take a shot at it and maybe I break it. And I'm real happy with myself, 'cause I did my job well.  But maybe that code was the location of some rebel army in North Africa or the Middle East. Once they have that location, they bomb the village where the rebels were hiding and fifteen hundred people I never had a problem with get killed. (rapid fire) Now the politicians are sayin' "send in the Marines to secure the area" 'cause they don't give a shit. It won't be their kid over there, gettin' shot. Just like it wasn't them when their number got called, 'cause they were pullin' a tour in the National Guard. It'll be some guy from Southie takin' shrapnel in the ass.  And he comes home to find that the plant he used to work at got exported to the country he just got back from. And the guy who put the shrapnel in his ass got his old job, 'cause he'll work for fifteen cents a day and no bathroom breaks. Meanwhile my buddy from Southie realizes the only reason he was over there was so we could install a government that would sell us oil at a good price. And of course the oil companies used the skirmish to scare up oil prices so they could turn a quick buck. A cute, little ancillary benefit for them but it ain't helping my buddy at two-fifty a gallon. And naturally they're takin' their sweet time bringin' the oil back and maybe even took the liberty of hiring an alcoholic skipper who likes to drink seven and sevens and play slalom with the icebergs and it ain't too long 'til he hits one, spills the oil, and kills all the sea-life in the North Atlantic. So my buddy's out of work and he can't afford to drive so he's got to walk to the job interviews which sucks 'cause the shrapnel in his ass is givin' him chronic hemorrhoids.  And meanwhile he's starvin' 'cause every time he tries to get a bite to eat the only blue-plate special they're servin' is North Atlantic scrod with Quaker State. 
A beat. 
WILL So what'd I think?  I'm holdin' out for somethin' better. I figure I'll eliminate the middle man. Why not just shoot my buddy, take his job and give it to his sworn enemy, hike up gas prices, bomb a village, club a baby seal, hit the hash pipe and join the National Guard? Christ, I could be elected President. 
SEAN Do you think you're alone? 
WILL What? 
SEAN Do you have a soul-mate? 
WILL Define that. 
SEAN Someone who challenges you in every way.  Who takes you places, opens things up for you. A soul-mate. 
WILL Yeah. 
Sean waits. 
WILL Shakespeare, Neitzche, Frost, O'Connor, Chaucer, Pope, Kant-- 
SEAN They're all dead. 
WILL Not to me, they're not. 
SEAN But you can't give back to them, Will. 
WILL Not without a heater and some serious smelling salts, no... 
SEAN That's what I'm saying, Will. You'll never have that kind of relationship in a world where you're afraid to take the first step because all you're seeing are the negative things that might happen ten miles down the road. 
WILL Oh, what? You're going to take the professor's side on this? 
SEAN Don't give me your line of shit. 
WILL I didn't want the job. 
SEAN It's not about that job. I'm not saying you should work for the government. But, you could do anything you want. And there are people who work their whole lives layin' brick so their kids have a chance at the kind of opportunity you have. What do you want to do? 
WILL I didn't ask for this. 
SEAN Nobody gets what they ask for, Will. That's a cop-out. 
WILL Why is it a cop-out? I don't see anythin' wrong with layin' brick, that's somebody's home I'm buildin'. Or fixin' somebody's car, somebody's gonna get to work the next day 'cause of me. There's honor in that. 
SEAN You're right, Will. Any man who takes a forty minute train ride so those college kids can come in in the morning and their floors will be clean and their trash cans will be empty is an honorable man. 
A beat. Will says nothing. 
SEAN And when they get drunk and puke in the sink, they don't have to see it the next morning because of you. That's real work, Will. And there is honor in that.  Which I'm sure is why you took the job. 
A beat. 
SEAN I just want to know why you decided to sneak around at night, writing on chalkboards and lying about it. (beat) 'Cause there's no honor in that. 
Will is silent. 
SEAN Something you want to say? 
Sean gets up, goes to the door and opens it. 
SEAN Why don't you come back when you have an answer for me. 
WILL What? 
SEAN If you won't answer my questions, you're wasting my time. 
WILL What? 
Will loses it, slams the door shut. 
WILL Fuck you! 
SEAN It's not your fault. 
WILL (dead serious) I know. 
SEAN It's not your fault. 
WILL Don't fuck with me. 
SEAN (comes around desk, sits in front of Will) It's not your fault. 
WILL (tears start) I know. 
SEAN It's not... 
WILL (crying hard) I know, I know... 
Sean takes Will in his arms and holds him like a child. Will sobs like a baby. After a moment, he wraps his arms around Sean and holds him, even tighter. We pull back from this image. Two lonely souls being father and son together. 
INT. RED LINE CAR -- DUSK 
Will rides the Red Line, above ground. He looks out over the landscape. Small back yards, laundry hangs from wire lines. 
Chainlink fences, overgrown with weeds. 
EXT. SOUTH BOSTON PARK -- DAY 
Will walking through South Boston. He cuts through a park. A senior citizen is spearing trach for the city. 
INT. WILL'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT 
Will at home. Not reading. Looks up at the ceiling. 
EXT. TRI-TECH LABORATORIES -- DAY 
Will walks up to a nondescript building, he walks through the glass doors, into the lobby. 
CUT TO: 
INT. TRI-TECH LABORATORIES, RECEPTION -- CONTINUOUS 
Will walks into the lobby. A SECURITY GUARD looks up. 
SECURITY GUARD Can I help you? 
WILL Yeah, my name is Will Hunting. I'm here about a position. 
SECURITY GUARD One moment. 
The guard reaches for the phone. 
DISSOLVE TO BLACK. 
FADE UP to the sound of laughter. 
INT. L STREET BAR & GRILLE -- DAY 
Chuckie is again regaling Will and the guys at their table. 
CHUCKIE Oh my God, I got the most fucked up thing I been meanin' to tell you. 
MORGAN Save it for your mother, funny guy. We heard it before. 
CHUCKIE Oh, Morgan. 
They both get up, in one another's face. This is a play fight. 
"You gonna start?" "You gonna pay my hospital bills?" 
WILL Sorry to miss this. 
INT. L STREET -- SAME 
Will comes back from the bathroom. 
WILL (to Chuckie) You and Morgan throw? 
CHUCKIE No, I had to talk him down. 
WILL Why didn't you yoke him? 
CHUCKIE Little Morgan's got a lot a scrap, dude.  I'd rather fight a big kid, they never fight, everyone's scared of 'em. You know how many people try to whip Morgan's ass every week? Fuckin' kid won't back down. 
MORGAN (from across the table) What'd you say about me? 
CHUCKIE Shut the fuck up. 
Billy walks in the door and give Chuckie a look. Chuckie turns to Will. 
CHUCKIE (To Will) Hey, asshole. Happy Birthday. 
MORGAN You thought we forgot, didn't you? I know I'm gettin' my licks in. 
Laughter as the boys converge on Will. He goes willingly out the door. 
They embrace. 
SEAN No. Thank you. 
WILL (re: embrace) Does this violate the patient/doctor relationship? 
SEAN Only if you grab my ass. 
They laugh. 
WILL See ya. 
SEAN Good luck. 
Both men smile. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE SEAN'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER 
Will comes out of Sean's office and sees Lambeau walking up. 
LAMBEAU (surprised) Will. 
WILL Hey, how you doin'? 
LAMBEAU You know, you're no longer required to come here. 
WILL I was just sayin' goodbye to Sean. 
LAMBEAU (a beat) Sam called me. From Tri-tech. He says you start working for them next week. 
Will nods. 
LAMBEAU Well, that's, I think that's terrific. Congratulations. 
WILL Thank you. 
LAMBEAU I just want you to know... It's been a pleasure. 
WILL Bullshit. 
They laugh. 
LAMBEAU This job... Do it if it's what you really want. 
WILL I appreciate that. 
A moment. Will starts to go, Lambeau watches him for a beat, Will turns back around. 
WILL Hey, Gerry. 
LAMBEAU Yes. 
WILL Listen, I'll be nearby so, if you need some help, or you get stuck again, don't be afraid to give me a call. 
LAMBEAU (has to smile) Thank you, Will. I'll do that. 
Will smiles, turns and walks away. 
INT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- DAY 
Sean is packing his office. Lambeau opens the door. 
LAMBEAU Hello, Sean. 
SEAN Come in. 
LAMBEAU Sean... 
SEAN (a beat) Me too. 
A moment. 
LAMBEAU So I hear you're taking some time. 
SEAN Yeah. Summer vacation. Thought I'd travel some. Maybe write a little bit. 
LAMBEAU Where're you going? 
SEAN I don't know. India maybe. 
LAMBEAU Why there? 
SEAN Never been. 
Lambeau nods. 
LAMBEAU Do you know when you'll be back? 
SEAN (picks up a flyer from his desk) I got this mailer the other day. Class of Sixty-five is having this event in six months. 
LAMBEAU I got one of those too.

HOW TO LOSE FRIENDS AND ALIENATE PEOPLE 
Written by 
Peter Straughan 
09/05/07 SHOOTING SCRIPT FADE IN: 
1 TV SCREEN - BLACK AND WHITE MOVIE 1 ...British, fifties, a melodrama. We're looking at an ACTRESS - glamorous, young - but very much in the back ground of the scene - a secretary typing at her desk. 
REVERSE A YOUNG BOY sits watching the film, his clothes and the room around him telling us this is England in the 1960s. He is staring raptly at the actress. 
SIDNEY (V.O.) All my life I've been a Looky- Loo. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
2 INT. GOLDEN GLOBES AWARDS - EVENING 2 
SLOW-MOTION We are CLOSE on an extremely handsome YOUNG MAN staring past us with a dazzling smile. 
SIDNEY (V.O.) My name's Sidney Young. I'm a journalist...a hack. (Beat) Yeah, that...that isn't me. We PAN right and down to our hero - SIDNEY YOUNG - thirties, an odd-ball with a knack for getting people to dislike him. 
SIDNEY (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D) This is me at the Golden Globe Awards in L.A. this year. That's my Armani tuxedo. That's a Rolex Sea-Dweller 4000 watch I'm wearing. Still in SLOW-MOTION we TRACK BACK and see that Sidney is at a table with several other people, all staring raptly past us to the stage which is out of shot. 
SIDNEY (CONT'D) Those people all around me - they're all famous. They're my friends. Beside him sits a beautiful young woman - SOPHIE MAES (20's). 
SIDNEY (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D) That's the actress Sophie Maes. This morning she told me she would let me have sex with her if she won the Best Actress Award. Still in SLOW MOTION, Sophie suddenly covers her face with her hands and begins to stand. 
SIDNEY (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D) She just won the Best Actress Award. Sophie walks out of the shot. Still sporting the fixed smile, Sidney claps in SLO-MO along with everyone else in the room. We TRACK away from Sidney past tables of CELEBRITIES towards an EXIT. 
SIDNEY (CONT'D) My life didn't used to be like this. We PUSH THROUGH the EXIT DOORS and find ourselves impossibly looking at... 
3 EXT. LONDON - LEICESTER SQUARE - LATE AFTERNOON 3 
4 SLOW MOTION TRACKING SHOT 4 ...a crowd of FANS held back from us by a red rope, craning their necks to see us more clearly, waving, cheering, shouting, cameras flashing... Rain lashes down. A CAPTION reads: "Sidney's Life, One Year Ago. Bafta Awards. London." 
SIDNEY (V.O.) Looky-Loos. That's what They call you when you stand out in the rain all night just to catch a glimpse of Them going by. REVERSE - CELEBRITIES walk down the red carpet, pausing to wave at the fans. 
SIDNEY (CONT'D) I used to pretend it was different for me because I was getting paid by a magazine or newspaper, whatever. But that's, you know...I just loved watching Them. I'd stand outside looking in through the window and think what it would be like to somehow get inside. But there was only one way to get past the thin red line that separates the celebrities from the civilians. You had to be famous. 
4A EXT. SECURITY POINT - LATE AFTERNOON 4A 
Sidney stands talking to a young PR WOMAN at the security gate. He has a small, ugly PIG on a leash. 
PR WOMAN Babe? 
SIDNEY Babe Three. Yeah. She looks doubtfully at the pig. 
PR WOMAN Babe was a cute little piglet. 
SIDNEY Harry Potter used to be a cute little piglet too. What do you want? Tempus Fugits... 
PR WOMAN He hasn't got any ID. 
SIDNEY How many pigs are coming tonight? Look, I was told to bring him, hand him over to the producer, Bob Milton, inside. You want me to leave him here with you, that's fine... 
PR WOMAN No, you can't leave him with me. I've got...Hold on, I'll... She looks around, helplessly. She begins to unhook the red rope. Sidney tries to hide his excitement. 
PR WOMAN (CONT'D) If you're positive that you're supposed to... An OLDER PR WOMAN stalks over. 
OLDER PR WOMAN 
(ICILY) Well, well, Sidney Young. 
SIDNEY 
(RUMBLED) Well, well...clipboard Nazi-type woman. She turns to the SECURITY standing beside them. 
OLDER PR WOMAN The pig doesn't get in. 
She starts to walk away. 
SIDNEY What about me? 
SIDNEY Tits of Fury. She laughs. 
SIDNEY (CONT'D) 
(SMILING) I'm joking, I'm just...It's a bio- pic. About Greta Garbo. That's why I thought of you. You have those amazing cheek-bones and...are they real? Have you had plastic surgery? 
HOLLYWOOD ACTRESS No. Have you? 
SIDNEY Me? No, hardly anything. A penis reduction as a child, that's pretty much... She laughs again, snorting into her drink. Sidney can't believe this - she likes him! 
13 INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - EVENING 13 
The lift doors glide open and the Pig trots out and around the corner. The PR Woman is still at the door to the courtyard, berating one of her staff. The Pig sails past them both, unnoticed, and disappears into the party. 
14 INT. SHARPES PARTY - EVENING 14 
A YOUNG MAN sits drinking at a table. He slips a little bag of Ecstasy from his pocket and takes one. 
UNDER THE TABLE As the Young Man pushes the bag back into his pocket. The Pig sits at his feet watching as the little bag slips back out and DROPS to the floor. The Pig sniffs at the bag... 
15 SIDNEY AND HOLLYWOOD ACTRESS 15 ...still talking. The place is crammed now, and hot. Sidney wipes sweat from his forehead. 
HOLLYWOOD ACTRESS Oh god, I'm drunk. 
SIDNEY Are you? 
HOLLYWOOD ACTRESS I'm so drunk. I haven't eaten and... 
SIDNEY You feel okay? Because my room's just upstairs if you want to lie down or, or loosen any, you know, morals or... 
HOLLYWOOD ACTRESS 
(LAUGHING) What is your name again? 
SIDNEY Clark. Clark Baxter. He takes a sip of his champagne and his moustache comes loose and hangs limply from his face. 
SIDNEY (CONT'D) How'd you do? The Actress stares at him in surprise but Sidney doesn't notice - he is staring past her to where there is something of a COMMOTION amongst the guests. The PR Woman is hurrying across the room, hissing into her ear-piece. Somebody screams. Then to Sidney's horror a group of guests scatter in panic and the cause of the commotion is revealed: the Pig charges into view, heading straight for him. 
SIDNEY (CONT'D) 
(MUTTERING) Oh, shit... The Pig suddenly skids to a halt and stares at Sidney with hot eyes. The PR Woman follows the Pig's gaze and spots Sidney. 
OLDER PR WOMAN 
(INTO HEADSET) Sarah, get security! Code Red. Sidney Young got in! 
HOLLYWOOD ACTRESS 
(FEARFULLY) Who's Sidney Young? Before Sidney can answer the Pig charges. 
SIDNEY Oh, shit! Sidney turns and legs it. 
ACROSS THE ROOM We are looking OVER THE SHOULDER of a tall grey-haired MAN who stands in the shadows watching Sidney run past. This is CLAYTON HARDING, his face hidden for the time being. 
He lights a cigarette with a thoughtful air and watches Sidney's flight, rolling the BOOK OF MATCHES between his fingers. 
BACK WITH SIDNEY ...as the Pig catches up with him and lunges at his ankles. Sidney screams, trips and flies through the air, wig spinning free, hurtling straight towards a table of startled celebrities. We FREEZE FRAME. SUPERED TITLE - "How To Lose Friends & Alienate People." We hear the opening of David Bowie's Star. 
16 INT. HOTEL CORRIDORS - LATER 16 
As the TITLES and song continue we see a protesting Sidney and Pig being escorted by Security through the endless corridors of the Hotel. Titles End. 
FADE OUT. 
FADE IN: 
16A EXT. LONDON FLAT - DAY 16A 
A seedy flat in Shepherds bush. 
17 INT. SIDNEY'S FLAT - BEDROOM - AFTERNOON 17 
Sidney lies in bed reading a newspaper in his underwear. A phone is RINGING in the next room. Sidney begins to cut out a photograph from one of the papers - Sidney struggling with an irate Clint Eastwood and some Security Men. The phone continues to ring. 
CLAYTON HARDING Sure. On his desk we see a few copies the Post-Modern Review - glimpses of stars on the covers - Catherine Zeta-Jones, Orlando Bloom... Clayton's hand sifts one copy from the others and holds it up - the cover depicts CLAYTON HIMSELF - patrician handsome, stern, photo-shopped so that he appears to be NAKED. A headline reads "Clayton Harding - The Editor's New Clothes? Clayton's shoulder's heave with a snort of repressed laughter. 
CLAYTON HARDING (CONT'D) (examining the cover) I especially liked the part where Clint Eastwood beat the shit outa ya. 
20 INT. MAGAZINE OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 20 
Sidney lights a cigarette, trying to seem casual. 
SIDNEY We're not scared of you, Harding. You want to sue, go ahead and sue. It's like Jimmy Stewart said, (a poor Stewart impersonation:)"You sit up there and you spin your little webs and you think the whole world revolves around you and your money. Well, it doesn't, Mr... Mr... 
21 INT. CLAYTON'S OFFICE - DAY 21 
Clayton is still flicking through the magazines. 
CLAYTON HARDING Potter. 
SIDNEY (O.S.) 
(OVER PHONE) "Mr. Potter..."You go ahead and sue if you want, but I warn you, if you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine. An ASSISTANT walks in. Clayton looks up. 
ASSISTANT 
(SOFTLY) Miss Taylor is here sir. Clayton nods and quickly throws the magazines into a BOTTOM DRAWER of the desk. Sidney is still talking over the phone, beginning to enjoy himself. 
SIDNEY (O.S.) Destroy me and a hundred more will spring up in my place - men who care nothing for success, men who cannot be bought, men whose only loyalty is to... 
CLAYTON HARDING 
(CALMLY) I want you to come and work for me at Sharps Magazine in New York. 
22 INT. MAGAZINE OFFICE - DAY 22 
Sidney stares to where the Thin Man is trying to get out of the door with the Fax Machine, the Large Woman struggling with him. The two fall to the floor. The rest of the staff gather around them. 
STAFF 
(CHANTING) Fight, fight, fight... 
SIDNEY 
(INTO PHONE) Um...could you say that again please? We hear the sound of an aeroplane engine build as we... 
23 AN AEROPLANE ROARS THROUGH THE BLUE SKY. 23 
24 EXT. JFK AIRPORT - DAY 24 
Sidney emerges from the airport, wearing his crumpled brown suit, dragging his suitcase behind him. He stares around, excited to be here. 
25 EXT. NEW YORK - HELL'S KITCHEN - EVENING 25 
Sidney drags his suitcase down the quiet street and stops outside an apartment block, checking the address. 
26 INT. STAIRS - EVENING 26 
An elderly Polish lady - MRS KOWALSKI - is leading Sidney up the stairs of the building. 
MRS KOWALSKI This magazine you are working for? It is good? 
SIDNEY It's Sharps Magazine. You know Sharps? It's sort of society, fashion, crime, finance, Hollywood celebrities... 
MRS KOWALSKI 
(SCORNFUL) Hollywood. Sodom and Gomorrah. Now everybody is celebrity. You take out your breasts, you are celebrity. 
SIDNEY (eyeing her chest 
DOUBTFULLY) Well, I think it depends on the breasts but... 
MRS KOWALSKI 
(OBLIVIOUS) In Poland, someone was famous because they had done something...Marie Curie...Pope John Paul... 
SIDNEY Yeah, they don't make entertainers like that any more... Mrs Kowalski cuffs the back of his head. Sidney is somewhat surprised by this familiarity, having only just met the lady. She opens an apartment door. 
SIDNEY (staring at a 
PHOTOGRAPH) Okay, I've got two old men here - so is he the fat one? 
WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) 
(BEAT) You do realize that Clayton Harding is a personal friend of mine? 
SIDNEY 
(BEAT) What's that got to do with anything? 
WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Right. She hangs up. Beat. Sidney looks around, hoping no-one was listening. He re-dials. 
WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D) Parsons gallery. 
SIDNEY Is he the one with the wonky eye? 
She hangs up again. 
CUT TO 
42 INT. LOBBY - LIFT - DAY 42 
Sidney, coming back from lunch, gets into the lift eating a HAMBURGER. Another of the magazine's Fashionistas - ANNA - gets into the lift and tries to hold the door open for an approaching friend. The doors swish shut, Anna pulling her hand out of the way just in time. The lift rises. 
SIDNEY It's fashion sensitive. If you're not wearing Prada it'll take your arm clean off. Anna stares at this strange man with the burger, baffled. 
ANNA But I am wearing Prada. The lift stops and she gets out. Alison gets in, sees Sidney and winces. She takes out a book and pretends to read. The lift begins to rise again. Through it's glass doors we see the different floors passing, different publications - each a hive of sober, hard work. Sidney stares at them. 
SIDNEY 
(MOUTH FULL) This isn't what I expected. Alison recoils slightly. 
ALISON What did you expect? 
SIDNEY I don't know. The Algonquin circle. Dorothy Parker. Martinis. Quips. Look at them. Not one of them is drunk. 
ALISON It's called being a professional. You should try it some time. 
SIDNEY There's something you should understand. I'm not really one of you. 
ALISON By "you" do you mean "human?" 
SIDNEY I mean the glossy posse. Bunch of Zombies, writing about "Pets of the Stars" but acting like they're working for the UN. I'm here to shake things up a bit. Where are you from? 
ALISON Not that it's any of your business, but I'm from Port Huron, Michigan. 
SIDNEY Right. Small town girl. (Hannibal Lector impersonation) I bet you could only dream of getting out. Getting anywhere - yes, Clarice? Getting all the way - to the N...Y...C. (Dropping the impersonation) Take my advice, don't go taking this celebrity fluff seriously. For a moment Alison is speechless with anger. 
ALISON You...you...arrogant... The lift stops and a TALL WOMAN enters. She is expensively dressed, wears Chanel dark glasses, an expression of granite and an air of superhuman froideur. Alison exchanges the slightest of nods with her and stares tensely ahead. Only Sidney, busy chewing, is oblivious to the plunge in temperature. For a moment there is only the soft whir of the lift. Then Sidney begins to choke on some burger. He wheezes for a moment, gagging. The Woman stiffens slightly but shows no other sign of having noticed the revolting noises coming from behind her. Alison closes her eyes. Sidney gives a violent cough and a chunk of chewed burger and coleslaw flies out of his mouth and lands on the back of the oblivious Woman's Prada jacket. Sidney notices and raises a tentative hand to brush the offending item away. Before he can move Alison silently takes his wrist in a vice-like grip. 
43 CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER 43 Alison is haranguing Sidney. 
ALISON 
(HISSING) Are you insane? That was Lawrence's wife, Elizabeth! Her father owns Sharps! 
SIDNEY That was her? The Mussolini baby? He stops. 
SIDNEY (CONT'D) I could go back and tell her I'm... 
ALISON No! Listen to me - you do NOT approach Elizabeth Maddox, you do NOT talk to her! Don't even make eye-contact with her? Do you understand? 
SIDNEY Am I supposed to be afraid? 
ALISON Yes. 
SIDNEY I don't know the meaning of the word fear. 
ALISON I'm sure there are many words you don't know the meaning of! She walks on, shaking her head in disbelief. 
ALISON (CONT'D) When I think of all the people who would kill to be where you are. And you lumber in here, spitting food, haven't got the brains God gave a mollusc...why did Clayton hire you? 
RACHEL (CONT'D) Funny I should run into you. I've just done this great little film called Five Boroughs and it's you know, low-budget, first-time director but very, uh, moving and... Hey, maybe you could do a little...? 
A handsome YOUNG MAN passes by. Maddox instantly turns away from Rachel. 
LAWRENCE MADDOX 
(SMOOTHLY) Angelo, good to see you. Rachel hovers for a moment, embarrassed by her abrupt dismissal then slips away. Sidney watches her go, feeling for her. 
SIDNEY 
(TO MADDOX) You know that was Rachel Petkoff? She's a fantastic actress. Hasn't done anything for years, but, in her day... 
LAWRENCE MADDOX 
(COOLLY) I'm sure. 
SIDNEY Seriously, I've heard about that film. I think she's going to make a come back. We should get there first, do a profile or something before everyone else... Maddox isn't listening. Instead he greets a fat, angry- looking VERY YOUNG MAN. This is VINCENT LEPAK, wearing his customary SHADES. 
LAWRENCE MADDOX 
(FAWNING) Vincent! Great to see you. Children, I'd like to introduce you to Vincent Lepak, enfant terrible and in, my opinion, the most exciting new director in American cinema. Vincent nods, frowning, looks around. 
VINCENT I think this is the worst fundraiser I've been to in my whole life. 
LAWRENCE MADDOX It's a rat fuck, isn't it? Sidney walks away. 
47 ANGLE ON RACHEL 47 ...standing at the parapet, smoking, staring out over the city with red eyes. Sidney appears beside her. 
SIDNEY Excuse me? Aren't you Rachel Petkoff? Rachel turns to look at him. 
SIDNEY (CONT'D) This is sort of embarrassing but... He holds out a napkin. 
SIDNEY (CONT'D) Could I have your autograph? Rachel, suspecting she is the target of ridicule, looks around to see if there's an audience. 
SIDNEY (CONT'D) I'm a big fan. 
RACHEL 
(HARD) Is that so? 
SIDNEY Absolutely. I must have seen everything you've been in. Those episodes of The Love Boat and the Bionic Woman? The Song Birds, In The Night...I've even seen your first ever TV appearance. The Twilight Zone - House of Mirrors. Right? 
RACHEL 
(THROWN) Right... 
SIDNEY My all time favorite? A Day Too Long. (He means it) You were really great in that. Rachel stares at him. She hides her emotion with a bright smile. 
RACHEL 
(LAUGHING) What's your name, honey? 
SIDNEY Sidney Young. She takes the napkin and pen, her face glowing. 
RACHEL 
(WRITING) Sidney Young. I'll remember that. 
48 ANGLE ON VINCENT 48 ...holding court to Maddox, Alison and some of the Glitterati. Sidney joins them, eating more food. 
VINCENT You look around and it's all shit. No-one is making movies that are fucking worthwhile. 
LAWRENCE MADDOX I'd have to disagree with you, Vincent. Vincent looks at him, displeased. 
LAWRENCE MADDOX (CONT'D) You're making movies that are worthwhile. Vincent accepts this with a curt nod. 
VINCENT This is what I'm saying. You have to inspire yourself. I am my role- model. I want to be me... He stares angrily around, handing his empty glass to his waiting assistant who immediately replaces it with a full one from a passing tray. Sidney watches him with dislike. 
SIDNEY 
(SUDDENLY) Greatest film ever made? 
VINCENT Excuse me? 
SOPHIE MAES No. 
SIDNEY Because I would certainly vote for you for best supporting dress! Huh, huh, huh.... 
SOPHIE MAES 
(STRUGGLING TO 
UNDERSTAND HIM) I haven't been nominated for anything. 
SIDNEY No, I'm just...I'm saying you look... They have reached the front entrance of the hotel. Eleanor steps between them. 
ELEANOR JOHNSON 
(TO SOPHIE) Are you ready dear? The front doors glide open to reveal a LEGION OF PAPARAZZI waiting outside. As Sophie steps outside there is a sudden roar of photographers shouting and the night sky blazes white as HUNDREDS OF CAMERAS FLASH SIMULTANEOUSLY. 
REVERSE - the group framed in the entrance-way - blinded by the glare, squinting. Only Sophie has her eyes open, smiling, looking like a star. 
50 EXT. OUTSIDE HOTEL - MOMENTS LATER 50 
The Paparazzi are still crowding around the group as they make their way to the waiting car. 
LAWRENCE MADDOX 
(TO ALISON) We're going on to the Circle Club. I'll see you tomorrow. 
ALISON 
(TIGHT) Okay. Good night. Maddox slips his jacket around Sophie's shoulders. 
SOPHIE Aren't you cold? 
LAWRENCE MADDOX I'm from Canada, land of ice and snow. They get into the car. Sidney tries to follow them. 
SIDNEY Budge up. 
LAWRENCE MADDOX Where are you going? 
SIDNEY I'm coming to the club. 
LAWRENCE MADDOX Sorry, you're not on the list. A small CHIHUAHUA - CUBA - on Sophie's lap snarls at Sidney. 
LAWRENCE MADDOX (CONT'D) See? Even Cuba says so. Maddox closes the door and the car glides away, Sophie kissing the dog on the nose. The Paparazzi hurry back to the entrance as another celebrity emerges, leaving Alison and Sidney staring after the car. 
SIDNEY 
(FUMING) That's... that turns my stomach. Pawing her like that. He's old enough to be her father. 
ALISON 
(IRRITATED) No he isn't. 
SIDNEY Yes he is. I started producing sperm when I was thirteen, so you know, technically... 
ALISON For your information he wasn't pawing her! He was just doing his job! In case you haven't noticed Sharps has to have a star on the cover every month. And most of those stars are clients of Eleanor's. So do not piss her off. 
SIDNEY She's a flak. Hacks don't take orders from flaks. And I don't think you can call that "doing his job." The man had no blood left in his upper body... 
ALISON 
(SNAPPING) Will you...? Oh, and next time you want to do the hilariously ironic I love Con Air skit would you mind...? 
SIDNEY I wasn't being ironic... 
ALISON ...would you mind not involving me, especially in the presence of Vincent Lepak who happens to be very important. 
SIDNEY Yeah, I could tell by the way he was allowed to stay up past his bed time. The car disappears into the distance. They watch it go. 
SIDNEY (CONT'D) Do you think she'd go out with me? 
ALISON Who? 
SIDNEY Sophie Maes. You think she'll go out with me? 
SIDNEY Listen, you know how things work around here. How am I going to get something in the magazine? Alison stares at him. 
ALISON I thought all this "fluff" was beneath you? 
SIDNEY It is but...things have changed. 
ALISON What's changed? 
SIDNEY Look, I know people think I'm a bit of an idiot and maybe I haven't started off too well here, but I want...I want... He seems so awkward that Alison begins to soften a little. 
SIDNEY (CONT'D) ...I want to have sex with Sophie Maes. (Beat) Before Maddox does. Alison's expression turns to disgust. 
ALISON You're loathsome, you know that? 
SIDNEY 
(OBLIVIOUS) I know he's got a head start on me but I'm going to win her back. Once I get my hooks into a girl, they never get free. 
ALISON Like ring-worm. She gets up and stalks out. Sidney glances through the glass partition and sees MADDOX walking past. 
SIDNEY 
(TO HIMSELF) The gloves are coming off. We hear the opening of Brigitte Bardot's Moi Je Joue as we... 
55 INT. ELEVATOR - DAY 55 
Sidney is pitching to Clayton in the elevator. 
SIDNEY Okay. Celebrity Trash Cans. The contents of celebrity trash cans are revealed and readers have gotta guess who the trash belongs to... Five bottles of Jack Daniels, a court order, and a copy of Mein Kampf? Mel Gibson! 
CLAYTON HARDING (getting out the lift) First Room, Sidney. First room. 
56 EXT. OUTSIDE CIRCLE CLUB - EVENING 56 
A small group of GLITTERATI pass the immense line of hopefuls waiting outside the club and are ushered inside by the DOORMAN at the entrance. Sidney walks confidently up, pretending to talk into his cell. The Doorman stands in his way, impassive. Still talking Sidney turns and walks away as if nothing has happened. 
57 INT. ELEVATOR - DAY 57 
Sidney standing with a MODEL-TYPE in the elevator. He takes a LAMINATED PHOTOGRAPH from his wallet and shows it to her. 
SIDNEY (pointing at the snap) Guess who that is with Clint Eastwood? 
MODEL Morgan Freeman? 
SIDNEY No, not...why's everyone say...? There! In the head-lock! 
58 INT. CLAYTON'S OFFICE - DAY 58 
Sidney pitches to a closed door in the office. He is holding a LARGE PIECE OF CARD on which is drawn a TREE decorated with the heads of various CELEBRITIES. 
SIDNEY It's a Shag Tree. It illustrates all of the sexual pairings of Hollywood's top stars and how they interconnect... From under the door slides a piece of paper on which is written First Room. We hear a TOILET FLUSH. 
59 EXT. OUTSIDE CIRCLE CLUB - EVENING 59 
Sidney approaches the Doorman , takes a ten dollar bill from his pocket and hands it to the Doorman. The Doorman crumples the bill up and throws it away. Without a word Sidney begins to walk away. He comes back and picks up the crumpled note and then heads off again. 
60 INT. CLAYTON'S OFFICE - DAY 60 
Harding is eating lunch at his desk. He looks up and finds Sidney staring down at him with puppy-dog eyes. Beat. Harding sighs. 
CLAYTON HARDING If I give you an interview will ya leave me the fuck alone? Sidney smiles. The song ends. 
61 INT. STUDIO - DAY 61 
Nathan Lane shakes hands with Sidney as he sits down. 
NATHAN LANE Nathan Lane. Nice to meet you. 
SIDNEY Great to meet you Nathan. I'm a big fan. I love that rat thing you played in The Lion King. 
NATHAN LANE 
(PLEASANTLY) Actually he's a meer cat. 
ELEANOR JOHNSON Lawrence is taking us to lunch at Cipriani. 
SIDNEY 
(JEALOUS) Oh great. That's great. 
SOPHIE MAES Lawrence? Could I leave Cuba here? He doesn't like Italian food. 
LAWRENCE MADDOX Of course you can. He can stay in my office. Sidney? Fetch Cuba a bowl of water, will you? Sidney stares at him. 
SIDNEY (forcing a smile) Of course. 
64 WATER-COOLER 64 Eleanor is getting a cup of water from the cooler. Sidney joins her, waiting to fill the dog's bowl. 
ELEANOR JOHNSON That is a lovely ring. Where is that from? 
Sidney looks at the wedding ring he wears on his little finger. 
SIDNEY 
(EMBARRASSED) It was my mother's. She gave it to me. 
ELEANOR JOHNSON 
(SMILING) Oh, you Sweetie. That is very, very...(dismissing the topic) So, listen...You've met Vincent Lepak haven't you, Sidney? 
SIDNEY Uhuh. 
ELEANOR JOHNSON He has a new movie coming out soon and Lawrence is over- stretched as it is. How would you like to write a story on him? Alison, at the photocopier nearby, listens. Sidney smiles, filled with hope. 
SIDNEY A story? Absolutely. That would...I'd love to... 
ELEANOR JOHNSON 
(SOFTLY) Well, great. Maybe we could get together and discuss the angle? 
SIDNEY Okay. (Beat) What do you mean? 
ELEANOR JOHNSON Well, I'd need to know how we're going to present Vincent, check the story, so on. 
SIDNEY 
(BEAT) You want copy approval? 
ELEANOR JOHNSON 
(SMILING) Any stories written about my clients need to be in their best interest, that's all. If things work out with Vincent we could maybe talk about a follow up story on Sophie? What do you think? Alison listens, her face registering her distaste. 
Sidney looks over at Sophie, struggling with himself. Finally... 
SIDNEY 
(RELUCTANTLY) I'm sorry, Eleanor, I don't...I don't work that way. Alison stares with surprise at Sidney. He just went up in her estimation. 
ELEANOR JOHNSON 
(AMUSED) Sidney dear, think of it like this: you write about one of my clients, you are borrowing some of their "star-light" to help sell your magazine. All I'm saying is quid pro quo. Sidney is unable to hold back a snicker. 
SIDNEY Their star-light? Eleanor's face hardens. 
65 MOMENTS LATER 65 Sidney watches Sophie, Maddox and Eleanor as they walk towards reception. 
66 INT. MADDOX'S OFFICE - LATER 66 
Sidney cracks open the door and peers inside. Cuba sits in the middle of the floor, staring at him. He emits a low growl. Sidney slides into the room. 
SIDNEY Hello Cuba. I'm Uncle Sidney, come to see how you are. You wanna play? You wanna little play? He takes a RUBBER BALL out of his pocket and holds it up for the dog to see. 
SIDNEY (CONT'D) Fetch! He tosses the ball in the air. Cuba runs after it and trots back, stumpy tail wagging, the ball in its teeth. 
SIDNEY (CONT'D) That's it! That's it! 
He strokes the dog. 
(NERVOUSLY) Clayton? Have you got a minute? Clayton lights a cigarette, stares out of the window. Sidney comes in. 
CLAYTON HARDING Did they find that rat yet? 
SIDNEY No...Not yet. I think maybe he got out the building? Sidney hovers. 
SIDNEY (CONT'D) Congratulations on the Man of the Year thing. How was the lunch? 
CLAYTON HARDING I don't know. Thousand dollars a plate, all I could taste was ass. I'm kissing their ass, they're kissing my ass. (Beat) I get this dream sometimes. Someone's set fire to the building - Heywoods - Sharps magazine - the whole thing, it's going up in flames. My analyst thinks it's an anxiety dream. I never tell him how happy I am watching the fucker burn. Sidney isn't sure what to say. Finally... 
CLAYTON HARDING (CONT'D) What do you want? Sidney takes a deep breath. 
SIDNEY I want to do a story on Vincent Lepak. Not a puff-piece. Something funny, but with teeth. The kind of thing Snipe would have done. Everyone's treating him like he's a genius and he's an idiot. Clayton notices the CLOSET-DOOR beside him and opens it. He stares at the rows of blue shirts hanging in there. He takes an armful out and examines them. 
CLAYTON HARDING Look at these things. How'd I get a closet full of blue fucking shirts? 
SIDNEY Um...I don't know. 
CLAYTON HARDING I don't know either. This is an office for Christ's sake! Why've I even got a fucking closet? He drops the shirts. 
CLAYTON HARDING (CONT'D) Do it. 
SIDNEY (he can't believe it) Do it? 
CLAYTON HARDING Fuck it. Yeah. Do it. He's an annoying little prick. Go take him down. This is your shot. 
SIDNEY Thanks Clayton! 
CLAYTON HARDING You're my little Hit Man. 
SIDNEY 
(BEAMING) I'm your little Hit Man! 
CLAYTON HARDING Go do it! 
SIDNEY 
(HAPPILY) Okay! He scuttles out. He ducks back around the door. 
SIDNEY (CONT'D) You could call me The Jackal! 
CLAYTON HARDING Out. 
SIDNEY 
(HAPPILY) Okay! He ducks back out again. 
69 INT. TRIBECA GRAND HOTEL - NIGHT 69 
Sidney is waiting in the lobby. A slightly spaced YOUNG WOMAN approaches him. 
ASSISTANT Mister Young? 
SIDNEY Yes? 
ASSISTANT I'm Sophie Maes' assistant. I'm afraid Sophie isn't here right now. 
SIDNEY (looking past her) Look I know she's in. I'm not a stalker. I just know she's upset about losing her dog and... 
ASSISTANT 
(FIRMLY) She isn't here. 
SIDNEY 
(SIGHING) Well, can I at least check that she got my present? 
ASSISTANT Okay. Did you send the flowers? 
SIDNEY 
(SNORTING DERISIVELY) Flowers? Yeah,'cos she doesn't get enough flowers, does she? No, I sent her the fish. The Young Woman looks suddenly nervous. 
(LAUGHING) What? 
SIDNEY Just most poets you see aren't really good-looking, are they? Spend their time stuck in a room, end up looking like Golem. Is he...? 
ALISON He's very handsome, thank you. 
SIDNEY 
(GLOOMILY) Right. 
ALISON You know what I don't understand? You're desperate to get a story in the magazine - so why wouldn't you play ball with Eleanor, write the puff-piece? 
SIDNEY I resent being bribed to gush sycophantically about a star, okay? I choose to gush sycophantically. Alison stares at Sidney trying to figure him out. 
SIDNEY (CONT'D) It's okay anyway. Clayton's given me a story. I'm on my way. 
ALISON 
(SMILING) Well, that's good. Sidney smiles back at her. They look at each other...it's almost the start of a MOMENT... Then suddenly on the TV above the bar, a MOVIE TRAILER begins. Distracted Sidney turns to watch - it's Sophie Maes' new film - The Suffragette - Sophie, a glamorous Emily Pankhurst... Sidney looks back to Alison but she has turned away, suddenly awkward. 
SIDNEY 
(EMBARRASSED) Okay, well...better get going.(Leaving) You take my advice, you'll get yourself a boyfriend who's going to show up once in a while. He leaves. Beat. Alison stares at the empty stool beside her. 
71 INT. MEETING ROOM - MORNING 71 
Clayton is rounding up another staff meeting. Sidney sits trying to contain his excitement. 
CLAYTON HARDING Which makes it...a half page left. Lawrence? Any ideas? 
LAWRENCE MADDOX Yeah. Rachel Petkoff, fabulous sixties actress, one of my all time favourites. Just made a wonderful movie called Five Boroughs. I think she's poised for a come-back and I think we should get there first, do a profile. Sidney stares at him in disbelief. He looks over to Alison who avoids his gaze. 
CLAYTON HARDING Sounds good. Let's do it. Okay that's it people. 
SIDNEY Uh...Clayton? 
CLAYTON HARDING What? 
SIDNEY Did you read my story on Vincent Lepak? Clayton frowns down at some papers, feigning distraction. 
CLAYTON HARDING What? Oh, yeah. That's...that's not going to work. Sidney can't believe it. Clayton gets up to leave. 
CLAYTON HARDING (CONT'D) Oh, and for those who haven't heard, Alison is going to be running the I Spy section from now on as Lawrence here has just gone up in the world. He is replacing Greg Roberts as Deputy Editor. Lawrence smiles modestly as the room applauds. Sidney looks like he is going to implode. 
72 INT. CORRIDOR - LATER 72 
Maddox passes Sidney in the corridor. Sidney glares after him. Suddenly... 
SIDNEY Rachel Petkoff? One of your favourite actresses? You'd never fucking heard of her! That was my idea! Lawrence stops and turns back. 
LAWRENCE MADDOX So it was. You have any more good ideas don't forget to bring them to my new office. He is about to walk on but remembers something. 
LAWRENCE MADDOX (CONT'D) By the way, there've been complaints about you skulking around the water-cooler, trying to talk to women. It's inappropriate behaviour. 
SIDNEY 
(LIVID) What? You spend half your life chatting up the staff! 
LAWRENCE MADDOX When I do it it's called flirting. When you do it it's called sexual harassment. Consider this an official warning. I won't tolerate sexist behaviour. He walks off. Sidney glowers after him. 
73 INT. LAWRENCE MADDOX'S OFFICE - DAY 73 
Lawrence is holding a meeting in his new office - half a dozen heads of departments sit around drinking coffee. Lawrence sits behind his desk, enjoying his new authority. 
LAWRENCE MADDOX I know that wasn't Greg's way of working but Greg isn't deputy editor any more. I am, and I'm making changes. There is a knock at the door and Sidney walks in with an attractive BLONDE WOMAN in a long coat and dark glasses. 
LAWRENCE MADDOX (CONT'D) What? 
SIDNEY Uh, Lawrence? This lady's been looking for you? 
LAWRENCE MADDOX (to the woman) Can I help you? 
WOMAN Are you Lawrence Maddox? The new deputy editor? 
SIDNEY Yup. 
OLDER MAN You should walk with bare feet as much as possible, ground all that negative energy. Sidney examines him. 
SIDNEY So...you're a wizard or...? 
OLDER MAN I'm a spiritual healer. 
SIDNEY You can make a living doing that? 
OLDER MAN Oh God no. I'm a dentist. They stare at the party for a moment. 
OLDER MAN (CONT'D) You want to do some coke? 
SIDNEY Um...no, thanks. 
86 LATER 86 Rachel Petkoff stands talking to some other guests. Sidney notices her and walks over. 
SIDNEY Hey! Hello again? Rachel smiles at him distantly, clearly not remembering him. 
RACHEL Hello. (Turning back to the others) No, Lawrence is a wonderful writer. I really felt like he got to the heart of me. Sidney snorts. Rachel turns back to him, faintly irritated. 
RACHEL (CONT'D) I'm sorry, have we...? 
SIDNEY Sidney. Sidney Young. We met at... Another GUEST walks past Sidney and kisses Rachel. 
GUEST I saw Five Boroughs the other day and wept! 
Sidney hovers for a moment, ignored, and then walks away. 
87 LATER 87 Dusk. The guests have gathered on the lawns to watch the fireworks. There are oohs and aahs as the rockets light up the sky. Suddenly... 
SIDNEY (O.S.) In-ger-lernd! Puzzled the guests turn to where a drunk Sidney is standing on the balustrade of the porch of the house. 
SIDNEY (CONT'D) In-ger-lernd! In-ger-lerrrrrrnd! He spots HUGH GRANT amongst the crowd, watching him, puzzled. 
SIDNEY (CONT'D) You! Grant! Come on! In-ger- lerrrr... With that he slips from the balustrade and crashes into the shrubbery below. 
88 LATER 88 Sidney limps through the trees, dabbing at a scratch on his face. He passes Alison who is sitting on a tree-swing, lost in thought, swigging absently from a bottle of wine. 
ALISON You okay? 
SIDNEY What? 
ALISON I said are you okay? 
SIDNEY I'm fine. Yup. Fine. (Beat) You? 
ALISON Yup. (Beat) No, actually. I hate my life so, you know, I'm gonna get drunk. Sidney nods, vaguely. They stand in awkward silence for a moment. Then... 
SIDNEY Right...See you... He walks off. Beat. He walks back into frame suddenly. 
SIDNEY (CONT'D) 
(FURIOUS) 
HOW COULD YOU? 
ALISON 
(STARTLED) What? 
SIDNEY How the...You...having an affair with Maddox! I mean...Maddox for Christ's sake! The Man With Hidden Shallows! Jesus! I mean, I used to think you were...I was starting to...I mean, at first I thought you were a pain but then I started to think...but I mean...Maddox? How can you live with yourself? Alison stares at him, pale, blinking back tears. 
ALISON 
(QUIETLY) I couldn't. That's why I've broken up with him. 
SIDNEY Well, that's no...that's, you know...(Beat) You broke up with him? Alison walks off. Beat. She walks back. 
ALISON Which leg did you hurt? 
SIDNEY 
ALISON (CONT'D) Secondly... 
SIDNEY Yeah, okay. Listen, you try driving in this state you're gonna kill yourself. 
ALISON Who'd care if I did? Beat. Suddenly she bursts into tears. Surprised, Sidney stands, uncertain what to do. 
ALISON (CONT'D) 
(SWAYING FORWARD) I've got to go. Got to go. Sidney holds her to stop her falling. He stares back at the pool and then down at Alison. 
94 INT. ALISON'S CAR - DRIVING - NIGHT 94 
Sidney is driving. Alison is still drunk. 
ALISON 
(SLURRING) I thought I had it all figured out. A - get the hell out of Port Huron, come to New York. B - do the serious journalism thing to pay the bills while I, you know, write the novel. C- Win a Pulitzer. E... 
SIDNEY 
D. 
ALISON D - I don't know what D was. Then I took the internship at Sharps and I met Maddox and he was...he was so...and before I know it I'm writing, you know, Ten Tips for the fucking Metrosexual and pretending this is what I wanted but this ISN'T what I wanted! And that's...that's why I hated you... 
SIDNEY I didn't know you hated me. 
ALISON 
(OBLIVIOUS) ...because you were right about me. I'm a ghoul, writing fluff! 
SIDNEY You're not a Ghoul. You're a Zombie. Alison leans her head against the window. 
ALISON But he isn't the person you think he is, okay? Maddox. That's just a front. He thinks he's let himself down by giving up the poetry and he's unhappy. And the marriage is a sham, I mean... I just...I couldn't end it. I just couldn't and... 
SIDNEY (can't take anymore) Look, I don't need to hear this. 
ALISON 
(STUNG) Fine. 
She begins to root through her bag. 
ALISON (CONT'D) Need a cigarette. Where are my fucking cigarettes? 
SIDNEY You don't smoke. 
ALISON Oh yeah. She looks at her reflection in the window. 
ALISON (CONT'D) Do you think I have low self- esteem? Am I afraid of a real relationship? Do I think an affair is all I deserve? I mean, okay, he's handsome and successful and he's great in bed... 
SIDNEY 
(IRRITATED) Could you just be quiet? He realises she has started to cry. 
ALISON When I told him I couldn't see him any more...I don't know if he cared. I love him and, and I don't know if he cares! Sidney watches, moved. 
SIDNEY 
(RELUCTANTLY) Well, I'm...I'm sure he does. He's probably just not very good at expressing his emotions. 
ALISON 
(SOBBING) I'm so fucking sophisticated! I mean there's not even a little bit of Port Huron left, right? I've got the haircut and the job and I've got the parties and I've even, I've even got the affair because that's what sophisticated fucking people do! 
SIDNEY Alright. Alright. Don't, you know, get snot everywhere... 
ALISON Oh G-God... 
SIDNEY What? Alison lurches down out of sight and is sick on Sidney's shorts. 
95 INT. CAR - LATER 95 
Sidney is driving through Manhattan, the windows down. Alison is asleep. 
(SMILING) Please, call me Richard. I've written a little book so I'm doing a few talks. 
ALISON A book! Hey - I'm writing a book. What's yours about? Don't tell me - it's a thriller, right? 
RICHARD YOUNG 
(LAUGHING) No, nothing so interesting I'm afraid. I'm a philosopher. 
ALISON 
(SURPRISED) Philosophy? Really? Have you written any... Alison stops dancing, stares at him, something occurring to her. 
ALISON (CONT'D) Oh my God...Richard? R.C. Young? You're R.C Young? (To Sidney) You...you didn't say... Sidney avoids her eye. 
RICHARD YOUNG 
(TO SIDNEY) I'd love to hear what you think of the book if you have time to read it. Alison snorts with laughter. 
ALISON What would Sidney know about philosophy? 
RICHARD YOUNG Well, he does have a Masters in the subject. Alison stares at Sidney. She breaks into a snorting laugh again. 
ALISON You're shitting me! Sidney? He...he likes Con Air! She stops laughing, hit by a sudden wave of nausea. 
ALISON (CONT'D) I...I don't feel very well. Mrs Kowalski stands up. 
MRS KOWALSKI Come on. It is time you went to bed. (To Sidney) You can sleep on the couch. 
ALISON Okay. Better go before I find out something else I don't know about Sidney. Mrs Kowalski turns to Richard. 
MRS KOWALSKI It was a pleasure to meet you Lord Young. Alison stares at Sidney who smiles weakly. 
98 LATER 98 Richard and Sidney sit alone. 
SIDNEY You should have said you were coming. 
RICHARD YOUNG 
(WRYLY) That would have required you answering one of my calls. 
SIDNEY I've been pretty busy. 
RICHARD YOUNG Which reminds me, I was talking to a publisher friend of mine the other day. He mentioned that they were planning a series of introductory texts on philosophers. I wondered if you would be interested? 
SIDNEY 
(ANNOYED) I have a job, dad. 
RICHARD YOUNG Of course, of course. I picked up a copy of your magazine at the airport. Sidney stiffens a little. 
RICHARD YOUNG (CONT'D) Most enjoyable. (Beat) I particularly liked the young Hollywood actress who said she'd like to start her theatre career "somewhere small, like London or England." 
SIDNEY 
(IRRITATED) Why've you always got to do this? It's...it's... 
RICHARD YOUNG It was just a joke Sidney... 
SIDNEY Actually it's not. Because you're saying that what I do for a living is worthless and... 
RICHARD YOUNG I don't think it's worthless. I just think, in your heart, you know you could do more with your life than... 
SIDNEY 
(ANGRY) More? Sharps is one of the most respected magazines in the world. There's a million hacks who would kill to be where I am now. 
(MORE) 
SIDNEY (CONT'D) You know who I interviewed recently? Nathan Lane. 
RICHARD YOUNG I don't know who... 
SIDNEY I KNOW you don't know who that is! You don't know who anyone is! You thought Brad Pitt was a cave in Yorkshire! But most people do know who they are, okay? And most people wouldn't think that a journalist who gets to mix with stars like that was a, a disappointment! 
ALISON Must have been pretty cool having your mom in the movies. 
SIDNEY Yeah, I suppose. I used to see her on the TV every now and then when I was growing up. Sort of weird. He carries the plates over to her. 
SIDNEY (CONT'D) Here we go! English fry-up. Perfect hangover cure. Sidney puts a plate of bacon, eggs and sausages in front of her. Alison stares at it, going green. Suddenly she darts from the room. 
101 LIVING ROOM - LATER 101 Sidney is tidying. He upsets Alison's bag from the couch and its contents spill onto the floor - the NOTEBOOK is amongst them. Sidney stares at it, hesitates and then, unable to resist, opens it up and starts to read. Alison walks into the room. Sidney looks up guiltily. 
SIDNEY Sorry, I was just...uh...(He can't think of an excuse) ...rooting through your private possessions... Alison sits on the couch, feeling too ill to be annoyed. 
SIDNEY (CONT'D) I like the opening. 
ALISON You do? 
SIDNEY I do. Can I read the rest of it? Believe it or not, I'm a pretty good editor. 
ALISON I don't know. I don't even know if I'm going to bother finishing it. 
SIDNEY "Keep true to the dreams of thy youth." Alison examines him through narrowed eyes. 
ALISON Is that from Troy again? 
SIDNEY Schiller. She puts her things back in her bag. 
ALISON I'll jump in the shower and then I really will get out of your hair. Sidney watches, not wanting her to go. 
SIDNEY Oh, I forgot...I got you a present. 
He hands her a bag. Surprised she opens it and takes out a RECORD. It's the Nino Rota sound-track to La Dolce Vita. 
SIDNEY (CONT'D) I was just walking past this music shop on the corner and I saw it. I thought it might cheer you up. Alison is deeply touched. 
ALISON That's...I don't know what to say. (Beat) I haven't got a turntable. 
SIDNEY Oh. (Beat) Well, you can always come here to listen to it. Sidney takes the record and puts it on the turntable in the corner of the room. He selects the finale music - it's funny and sad, glamorous and romantic... They listen to it for a moment. Sidney starts to dance a little. He cha-cha's over to her and holds out his hand. 
ALISON Are you kidding? I could throw up on you again. 
SIDNEY C'mon... Alison reluctantly gets up. They dance ironically. Alison laughs a little. Gradually they get more into it, enjoying the music - a man in shorts and a woman in pyjamas, cha-cha-chaing, a summer breeze wafting in the through the open windows behind him... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
102 INT. I SPY AREA - DAY 102 
Some weeks later. Alison sits at her desk, trying to work. She looks up and catches Maddox watching her with soulful eyes from across the room. She looks quickly away, unsettled. Sidney sits at his desk surreptitiously watching her, 
SMITTEN. 
103 INT. BREAK ROOM - DAY 103 
Autumn. Rain lashes against the window. Alison drinks coffee. Ingrid and Anna are examining a rack of clothes behind her. Ingrid is holding up a dress. 
INGRID Hey, Alice? Versace. You like? 
ALISON I'm good, thanks. 
INGRID Honey, everyone needs to change their look every now and then. Especially if they have a new man in their life. 
ALISON 
(EMBARRASSED) What are you talking about? 
104 CORRIDOR OUTSIDE ROOM 104 Sidney is just about to enter the room. 
INGRID (O.S.) Well, that English guy is always hanging around you these days, right? Sidney freezes, listening. 
105 BREAK ROOM 105 Alison blushes fiercely. 
ANNA 
(LAUGHING) Tell me it isn't so. 
ALISON 
ALISON Yeah, so...maybe he does care after all, right? 
SIDNEY Yup. They stand in an awkward silence, watching the party. 
111 INT. WASHROOMS - LATER 111 
A dejected Sidney stands washing his hands. Maddox walks in behind him. 
LAWRENCE MADDOX Hello Sidney. Someone said you'd come as a Count but I thought I'd misheard. Sidney doesn't answer, turns to leave. 
LAWRENCE MADDOX (CONT'D) So Alison told you we were getting together right? 
SIDNEY 
(TIGHT) Yeah. 
LAWRENCE MADDOX Yeah. Should have done it long ago but, you know me - just not very good at expressing my emotions. Right? 
He watches Sidney's reaction, smirking. 
LAWRENCE MADDOX (CONT'D) You must be happy for her, what with you being friends... Sidney blushes. 
LAWRENCE MADDOX (CONT'D) 
(LAUGHING) Oh Sidalee...I thought as much. Did you really think you and Alison...? Things really haven't worked out too well for you here, have they? Ah, well. You gave it your best shot. He walks out. Sidney stares after him, burning. 
112 EXT. OUTSIDE CLUB - NIGHT 112 
Rain pours down. Eleanor and Vincent climb into a limousine and close the door. Sidney runs up. 
SIDNEY Wait! Eleanor wait! The window glides down. 
ELEANOR JOHNSON Yes? 
SIDNEY Let me do the profile on Vincent. 
ELEANOR JOHNSON 
(AMUSED) I don't think so. The window begins to slide up. Sidney hangs onto it. 
SIDNEY You get full copy approval. It'll be like you've written it! The window stops. Eleanor stares at him, considering. Sidney looks past her to Vincent. 
SIDNEY (CONT'D) 
(DETERMINED) Vincent - think about it, think how humiliating it will be for me. I'm begging you. Vincent leans over, stares over his shades at Sidney. 
VINCENT (Beat, enjoying this) You don't look like you're begging. Beat. Sidney kneels down on the side-walk beside the limousine. The rain pours down on him. The limousine drives away. Sidney stares dumbly up at something across the street. 
REVERSE On the building across the street is an ENORMOUS ANIMATED BILLBOARD L'OREAL ADVERTISEMENT - SOPHIE MAES, in a gold ball-gown and make-up, hair coiffured in classic forties Hollywood style. As we watch she BLOWS US A KISS. Underneath is the slogan - I'm Here... 
113 INT. CLAYTON HARDING'S OFFICE - DAY 113 
Sidney sits in front of Clayton. 
CLAYTON HARDING Lawrence Maddox is no longer working for Sharps. Seems Elizabeth got sick of him screwing around and kicked him out. 
SIDNEY She kicked him out? 
CLAYTON HARDING 
(IGNORING THIS) Richard Heywood doesn't seem to like the idea of employing an ex- son-in-law. So he's gone. So's Alison Olsen. Sidney stares at him. 
CLAYTON HARDING (CONT'D) Don't worry about Maddox. He's already lined up something with Gotham Magazine. I'm gonna need someone to hold the fort at I Spy. Strictly on a temporary basis, you understand? One more thing. Eleanor Johnson rang this morning, wondering if you'd like to write a profile on Vincent Lepak. Sidney stares at him. 
CLAYTON HARDING (CONT'D) I don't know how you did it but somehow you've made it into the next room. 
We hear the opening of Pretty Vacant by the Sex Pistols as we... 
114 MONTAGE 114 
115 INT. RESTAURANT - DAY 115 
As the song continues we see Sidney interviewing Vincent, complete with shades. 
LAWRENCE MADDOX (CONT'D) 
(IRRITATED) And will you stop carrying that thing around with you? It's kind of embarrassing. He walks off. 
128 INT. BAR - EVENING 128 
Sidney is with Eleanor and Sophie, who now looks every inch the movie star. 
ELEANOR JOHNSON Sophie's going to get a Golden Globe nomination for best actress. 
SIDNEY Wow. That's fantastic.(Beat) But...the nominations haven't been announced yet? 
ELEANOR JOHNSON That is correct so we have absolutely no way of knowing whether or not she will be nominated. (Beat) So, if she is nominated we want Sharps to do a feature. Someone to cover the whole lead up, unrestricted access, the trajectory, the building of this unique brand. 
SOPHIE MAES I'm going to have a logo. 
ELEANOR JOHNSON Here's the deal. Sophie wants you to do it. Sidney stares at her and then at Sophie, stunned. 
SOPHIE MAES 
(PLEASANTLY) You can be my bitch. 
ELEANOR JOHNSON Merry Christmas, Sidney. This is a cover story. I think a little celebration is in order. 
129 EXT. OUTSIDE CIRCLE CLUB - NIGHT 129 
Snow falls. Sidney climbs out of a limousine with Eleanor and Sophie. The women breeze past the Doorman and into the club. Sidney hesitates on the thresh-hold, staring up at the sign above him as if it's a magic portal. Sidney walks in. 
130 INT. CIRCLE CLUB - LATER 130 
A surprisingly small, ultra A-list club, chic and ironic Christmas decorations. Sidney walks past celebrities and beautiful people. He's arrived. 
131 INT. CIRCLE CLUB - NIGHT 131 
Sidney stands with Kevin Bacon playing Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon. People stand around watching. 
KEVIN BACON Okay, uh...Clark Gable. Go! 
SIDNEY Clark Gable to Vivien Leigh (Gone With The Wind), Vivien Leigh to Marlon Brando (Street Car Named Desire), Marlon Brando to Robert DeNiro (The Score) Robert De Niro to Kevin Bacon (Sleepers)! The crowd cheers. 
131A INT. CIRCLE CLUB - POWDER ROOM 131A 
A very drunk Sidney stands in a toilet cubicle with a YOUNG ACTRESS doing coke. 
ACTRESS Sexiest philosopher? 
SIDNEY Uh, tricky, but I'm gonna say Nietzsche. Huge moustache. The Tom Selleck of Nihilism. 
ACTRESS Um...most evil philosopher. 
SIDNEY Okay. Good. Evil genius philosopher...Hobbes, proto-Nazi, Heidegger - actual Nazi, Hegel - twat. Basically your H's... 
ACTRESS Most Hollywood philosopher? 
SIDNEY Uh...Bishop Berkely. 
ACTRESS What'd he say? 
SIDNEY Esse est percipi. 
FIRST ACTRESS What does that mean? 
SIDNEY If they `aint looking at you, you don't really exist. 
ACTRESS 
(WEARILY) Oh honey, tell me something I don't know... Sidney stoops and snorts a line of coke. 
132 CIRCLE BAR - NIGHT 132 Sidney, giddy on champagne, coke and success is dancing with Sophie. He's at the centre of the world. 
133 INT. SIDNEY'S APARTMENT - MORNING 133 
The doorbell rings. Sidney wearing a silk dressing gown wanders through the room from the bedroom and opens the door. Alison stands outside, smiling at him. 
SIDNEY Your limpy pig. 
SOPHIE MAES What? 
SIDNEY I'm your limpy pig! 
SOPHIE MAES That's right! Okay, limpy pig. You need to pay a forfeit. Whatcha got? 
SIDNEY I've got my little limpy dance. Sidney dances a little, jiggling up and down. 
SOPHIE MAES 
(SUDDENLY) Give me your ring. Sidney stops dancing, his smile fading a little. 
SIDNEY I...I can't... 
SOPHIE MAES Give me the ring. I want it. 
SIDNEY I can't. Sophie stares at him through narrowed eyes. 
SOPHIE MAES Okay, give me the ring and if I win tomorrow, I'll let you have sex with me. The on-lookers shriek with delight. Sidney stares at her. He looks past her to his reflection in the window - a drunk man in his underwear, swaying from side to side... 
137 INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 137 
Sidney is back in his own room, alone, a mess. He sits on the floor chopping lines of coke on the coffee table. He stares groggily at the space on his finger where his ring used to be. 
SIDNEY (muttering to himself) You're a star. You're a big, bright shining star... He snorts a line and, leaning back, flicks blankly through TV channels - a sports programme, a news station, a sit-com re-run... He snorts another line, flicks stations - more sports, a music video, a black and white movie... Sidney stops, staring at the screen... TV SCREEN - we're watching the fifties British movie we saw at the beginning of the film. Sidney's MOTHER is typing at the desk in the background. She gets up from the desk and walks into another office. Sidney stares, frozen. Sidney's mother passes the LEAD ACTRESS who is staring out of the window, smoking. She stares at her sympathetically. 
SIDNEY'S MOTHER (Celia Johnson accent) Don't worry Mary...you'll meet him one day. 
LEAD ACTRESS 
(SMILING SADLY) How will I know when I do? 
SIDNEY'S MOTHER Oh, when you meet the One, you'll know... She walks on. Sidney stares at the screen. 
138 EXT. BEVERLY HILTON - EVENING 138 
A conveyor belt of limousines arriving outside the Hilton. Rain falls. Celebrities wave to the watching crowds as they make their way up the red carpet, cameras flash... Sophie emerges from a limo, looking amazing. SHE IS WEARING A FUR WRAP. She makes her way up the carpet, Sidney walks behind, smiling vaguely... 
139 INT. BEVERLY HILTON - EVENING 139 
Various celebrities are being interviewed. Sidney stands a little apart, lost in thought. 
LAWRENCE MADDOX Well, well... Look at you... 
Lawrence Maddox stands beside him, something nervous in his manner now, the old confidence gone. He has been drinking. 
LAWRENCE MADDOX (CONT'D) Made it all the way to the Seventh Room. He holds out his hand. 
LAWRENCE MADDOX (CONT'D) Congratulations. The wheel of fortune right? You go up, I go down. You're here with Sophie? How about doing your old Rabbi a favour and putting in a good word for me? Maybe a little interview? Sidney absent-mindedly takes his hand, looking past him. 
SIDNEY Is Alison here? 
LAWRENCE MADDOX Alison? No, we went our separate ways. Actually she left me. Tells me she's in love with someone else. Sidney stares at him. 
LAWRENCE MADDOX (CONT'D) Nope, not you I'm afraid Sidalee. She threw us both over. Some guy named Clark. I mean...Clark. Can you believe it? But these are the sacrifices we make, right? I don't need to tell you. It's not a vacation. It's a vocation. So listen, about Sophie... But Sidney is no longer listening. 
140 INT. GOLDEN GLOBES AWARDS - EVENING 140 
SLOW MOTION - we move in on Sidney, sitting at the table, listening to the Best Actress award. This is where we first met him. 
SIDNEY (V.O.) This is me at the Golden Globes. That's my Armani tuxedo. That's a Rolex Sea-Dweller 4000 watch I'm wearing. I'm inside. I'm at the centre of everything. I'm right where I wanted to be. Beside him Sophie covers her face with her hands and starts to stand, having just won Best Actress. 
Sidney stares at her hands - she is wearing his gold ring. We move back into real time, sound swells up, thunderous applause. Sidney claps along with the others. Then he stands up and goes after Sophie. 
SIDNEY (CONT'D) (taking her arm) I need my ring back. Sophie turns back to him, her smile fixed.

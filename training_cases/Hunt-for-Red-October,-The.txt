ON A BLACK SCREEN, THE FOLLOWING CRAWL: 
MOSCOW, 17 JULY 1991. THE KREMLIN 
ANNOUNCED THE 'RETIREMENT' OF 
MIKAHIL, GORBACHEV AS WELL AS 
POLITBURO MEMBERS YAVOLEV, 
MENDVENDEV AND BIRKOVO. 
DEFENSE MINISTER ULINOV ASSUMED 
THE ROLE OF CHAIRMAN. KGB HEAD 
LIGACHEV BECAME PREMIER VOWING 
"A RESTORATION OF DISCIPLINE." 
WESTERN LEADERS BRACED FOR 
A NEW ROUND OF COLD WAR. 
FOUR MONTHS LATER... 
FADE IN 
A BARREN LANDSCAPE beneath slate-grey sky. Frigid rock and stunted trees fall to an ice-choked coast. Congealed sea on a desolate beach. 
MARKO ALEXANDROVICH RAMIUS bare-headed in cold wind, studies the inclement coast. Bottomless eyes move slowly across the landscape, missing nothing. 
SUPER: POLWARNY INLET Soviet Submarine Base on the Barents Sea 500 mi north of Murmansk Ramius wears a tar black winter uniform of Captain First Rank in the Soviet Navy. Behind him, out of sight, someone SPEAKS: 
VOICE (OS) Cold this morning, Captain. Ramius shivers. When he replies, he speaks not about the weather, but of the land: 
RAMIUS It is cold. 
(BEAT)- And hard. Turning his back on the icy coast, Ramius smi-I fondly at the man who just spoke to him 
CAPTAIN SECOND., RANK VASILY BORODIN Ramius' executive officer, also in black uniform. Borodin's rigged with a mike. , Brass .buttons gambol in his Nubian cap like money. 
RAMIUS (CONT'D) e your head a bit. No need to crowd him. 
BORODIN 
(INTO MIKE) Come left three degrees. Make your course three-four-zero. Sonar, let me know when we pass fifty, fathoms. A HELMSMAN responds on a SPEAKER in the SAIL. Nautical CROSS TALK. Orders GIVEN and AFFIRMED. Pulling back, Ramius and Borodin are revealed standing atop 
THE RED OCTOBER a huge submarine, trading a gigantic rudder a hundred yards aft her sail. A patrol BOAT and ICEBREAKER escort her to sea. On SPEAKERS in the SAIL: 
HELMSMAN (VO) Captain, political off=er Putin requests permission to come to the bridge. 
RAMIUS 
(GLANCING AT 
BORODIN) Granted. 
BORODIN (under his breath) Think of it, Comrade.. .son of only a humble mM worker... 
RAMIUS Quiet as grass, Vastly. Quiet as grass. (louder, turning) Good morning, Comrade political off=er 
IVAN YURIEVICH PUTIN block-faced, forties, pink-necked, political officer assigned to Red October, clambers through the hatch into the air, wheezing: 
PUTIN Ah,, Captain, every time I climb that ladder, I realize what an over-fed ox rve become. Put in smiles. Ramius smiles back, but his eyes are cold. Suddenly, there's not a lot of Lave on the bridge: 
PUTIN (CONT'D) 
(EXPANSIVELY) Such a glorious day. So exciting to h t ally put the land behind us and be on our way. 
(TO RAMIUS) Bourgeois of me, I know, but my enthusiasm at being chosen polidcica]. officer on this historic mission Its me with pride. 
THE ROVER pulling to a curb in driving rain at Heathrow. Red Army CHORUS SWELLS. Leaping out, Ryan grabs luggage and races to the driver's side. Margaret pulls his face through the window. 
RYAN I'm all wet. 
MARGARET 
(KISSING HIM) You're sexy when you're wet. 
RYAN 
(GRINNING) I'm gonna miss you. 
MARGARET Get out of here, Yank. Or Ml tear you limb from limb. 
(HE STARTS) Wait! I got you these. They'Il help you sleep on the plane. She has a bottle of piUs in her hand. He squints at it, shaking his head in the pouring rain: 
RYAN Won't do me any good --- 
MARGARET Jack. 
RYAN 
(SHEEPISH) OK. I ll try. Taking the pil3s, he kisses her again. All of a sudden, he wants to climb inside, park someplace and steam the windows. Her smile is 
ALL KNOWING: 
" MARGARET You only have three minutes. 
RYAN 
(GIG) Hey.. If I'm lucky, might miss the damn plane altogether. 
CUT TO-0- - seated beneath the only light in a dark cabin. Engines HUM. Turbulence RATTLES a TEACUP. A STEWARDESS appears, smiling down at him: 
STEWARDESS Can I get you anything, sir? 
RYAN 
' (LYING) I'm fine. Thank you. 
STEWARDESS Why don't you try to sleep? The l f ight will go much faster. 
RYAN.. I can't seem to sleep on planes. It's the turbulence. 
STEWARDESS Pardon? 
RYAN 
(SWALLOWING) Turbulence. You know. When solar radiation heats the earth's crust. Warm air rises. Cool air descends. Turbulence. I don't like it. 
STEWARDESS Are you a scientist? 
RYAN No. I just read a lot of books. 
STEWARDESS Well, try and get some sleep anyway. She leaves. Wide awake, Ryan stares out the window at the spinning dark. Red Army CHORUS BOOMS. 
CUT TO: 
RYAN humping his suitcase into a giant terminal at the end of a long line of travelers. Above the line, a sign:

WASHINGTON, D.C. 
A GUY IN SUNGLASSES moves down, the line, stopping beside Ryan:

SUNGLASSES 
(RESPECTFTAY) Mr. Ryan? Exhausted, Ryan nods. CHORUS SWELLS. Sunglasses takes Ryan's bags. 
CUT TO:. 
A BLACK LIIKO gliding to a stop at the security kiosk outside a suburban office compound. Sign over the compound's entrance: 
GREER When .do you want to talk to him? 
RYAN Right now if it's OX with you? 've. never met him personally, but - 
GREER I'll take care of it. 
(PICKING UP 
THE PHONE) Margie, have a car for Dr. Ryan at the front gate in tan. minutes. Ryan retrieves his photographs. Getting Up, Greer watches him, choosing his words carefully: 
GREER (CONT'D) One of our satellites caught Red October in Polijarny Inlet this morning. 
RYAN 
(SHOCKED) They shouldn't have been sea ready for weeks. Ryan closes his case. Greer walks him to the door: 
GREER Relax, son. The Navy's got a Las Angeles c'la'ss sittJng right off their doorstep. In a few days we'll know everything about her but the wok's name. 
RYAN Well, In that case -- 
(GRINNING) Can you tell me where I can buy a bear? 
GREER For Sally? 
(RYAN NODS) Same place you buy a baby brgther, I guess. 
CUT TO: 
A BANSHEE WAIL in blackness. The groan of a primordial beast echoing in the dark, followed by a deep vibration that rattles bones and shatters eardrums. The black screen is moving. A massive cylinder glides over the top of us like a giant spaceship, outlined by flashes of e1ectxic-blue phosphorenscence. 
SUPER: USS DALLAS Los Angeles Class Attack Sub 50 mks west of Polijarny Inlet 
DEPTH: 400 FEET 
ON THE DALLAS in the sonar shack, a state of the art sonar display glows blue. High tech graphics pinpoint movements in deep water beyond the hull.. 
SEAMAN SECOND CLASS RONALD JONES listens to a headset and eyeballs the display. A college dropout with a genius IQ, Jones is the kind of guy who likes tossing dead cats into crowded cathedrals. 
SEAMAN CHARLES BEAUMONT unruly red hair, a minion freckles and a wary smile, sits beside Jones. On SPEAKERS in the bulkhead, the PRIMORDIAL HOWL again, MUFFLED, clued with NOISE TRANSIENTS: 
JONES 
HEAR I 
BEAUMONT No. Maybe. It's buried in... 
JONES 
(LEADING) Yes? 
BEAUMONT Surface clutter? I should go to SAPS? 
JONES Correct, Seaman Beaumont. Surface Affects Processing. There is hope for your small brain yet. 
(BEAUMONT GRINS) And like Mozart at Saltzburg, you have labored to produce... 
(ANOTHER HOWL) hiclocdc. 
BEAUMONT 
JONES A whale, Beaumont. A whale. A marine mammal that knows a fuck of a lot more about sonar than you do. Beaumont frowns. Appearing in the sonar shack door, directly 
BEHIND JONES 
THE COB Chief of the Boat, a barrel-chested bear, smiles at Beaumont: 
COB He gets to raggin you too bad, kid, you can always ask him about Pavarattt.. Jones sinks into his chair. Beaumont grins. Sea story coming. From the look on Jones' face, it promises to be a good one: 
BEAUMONT Tell me, Chief. 
COB (taking his time) Well, Jonesy here, he's a music freak, right? And he figures this sonar system is basically just a big old 300 million ddllar stereo unit. So he gets this piece of Pavarmt3i -- 
JONES it was Paganini. 
COB Whatever. It's this piece of music he likes so much he wants to share it, right? So he re-wires the computer and figures how to put it in the water with a gigawatt of juice behind it. 
(BEAT) Now, the Captain, he don't much care. But about twenty-one boats out of San Diego, including one way out at Pearl, starts hearing Pavarotti Doming out their ass. Jonesy has turned the whole fucking Pacific Ocean into a stereo speaker. 
PUTIN As you wish. There's a safe on the wall. Ramius spins the combination. Inside, another safe with four locks. Both Ramius and Putin have keys. Inside the second safe, a large envelope. it has an ornate. scarlet seal, marked 'Top Secret'. Ramius cracks the seeal, removing four pages of operation orders. Glancing at Putin; he reads: 
RAMIUS We are to proceed to grid 54-90 and rendezvous with the Akula submarine, Konovalov. 
PUTIN Captain Tupalev's boat. 
RAMIUS You know Tupolav? 
PU TIN I know that he is descended from a long line of aril rats and that he was a student of yours. it is rumored, he has no love in his heart for you. Why is that? Ramius pours two cups of steaming tea from a silver pot on a serving tray, offering it to Putin.. Putin takes the cup. 
RAMIUS There is no room in Tupolev's heart for anyone or anything except Tupolev. 
(READING) Having made contact, we are ordered to run a series of drfl1 . Tupolev w2l hunt us while we test our ship. Putting down his tea, Putin stands, suddenly formal, awkwardly 
OBSEQUIOUS: 
PUTIN Captain, this is an historic moment for all. of us. I should like to make a request. 
RAMIUS Before you do, I want to talk to you about something important. 
PUTIN 
(NOT HEARING) I know that it is not aooording to protocxrl, but would you permit me to post the orders and inform the crew of our mission? 
RAMIUS 
(RESIGNED) As you wash, Comrade. Putin grins, heading for the door. He never makes it. In a sudden violent motion,, Ramius kicks Putin's left leg from under him. Surprised, the; big man tumbles sideways. Leaping to his feet, Ramius catches Putin, slamming him into a headlock, driving his thick neck downward, CRACKING his SKULL in the SHARP corner of the DESK. Putin gags. Cupping his chin, Ramius forces his entire bulk onto the man's chest. Putin struggles. His eyes bulge. Ramius strains, using all of his strength until.. 
PUTIN'S NECK SHATTERS and his face goes slack. With surprising gentleness, Ramius lowers the shuddering body to the deck. Carefully, he checks the pulse in Putin's neck. Dying, Putin stares into Ramius' face. 
RAMIUS (CONT'D) I an sorry my friend. But it is cyear to me now. Where I would walk, you cannot fallow. Whatever his destination, Putin's on his way. Getting up, Ramius goes to the desk. Returning with the teapot, he drenches the body with scalding tea. Replacing the pot on the tray, Ramius puts the orders in a wastebasket and sets them on are. Removing a duplicate set of orders from his safe, he' places them on the floor by the dead man. Satisfied everything is the way he wants it, he moves to an intercom and takes a deep breath. Pushing a button, he BELLOWS: 
RAMIUS (CONT'D) Dr. Petrov. Come to my quarters at once. There's been an aociderit! 
CUT TO: 
A MINI SUB resembling an airstream t xxzller with a propeller on the back. It's floating in a gargantuan tank fSlled with brightly lit water beneath a vast domed cet'ling:

TYLER You're never gonna go anywhere, Be.. Unless you close the hatch and start the goddam engine! 
STEINER Brilliant, Skip. You're one of those guys you can't hide things from, right? 
Tyler. grits his teeth. Steiner closes the hatch. Across the room, Ryan enters. Spotting Tyler, he moves to the platform, staring at the mini sub. The propeller starts turning. It submerges. 
TYLER 
(TURNING) Ryan? 
RYAN Yes sir. (re: mini sub) What it that thing? 
TYLER Deep submergence rescue vehicle. 
RYAN That's what a DSRV looks like. 
TYLER That's it. I designed this one. lt's aan d the Mystic. 
RYAN What are you doing with it? Tyler climbs off the piatfarm, working his cane with practiced precision. Taking Ryan by the arm, he heads for a door: 
TYLER Rigging it with a generic docking acllar so it will mate with British, German, other kinds of subs. 
(NODDING) This one here is designed to be super mobile. We can get it anywhere in the world in twenty-four hours. If that lunatic doesn't crash it fast:.

RAMIUS Good. Now, I want you and the Doctor to witness this, Ioginov. I have removed Putin's missfle key from his neck and am keeping it myse f. Iognov blinks. Petrov frowns. Closing the freezer door, the sates ]save. Loginov isn't sure what to do. Petrov's agitated: 
PETROV This is all very unnerving, Captain. The reason for having two missM keys in the first place is to prevent one person from... 
RAMIUS From what, Doctor? 
PETROV Making a mistake and... 
(EXASPERATED) We must report this to Red Meet Command. 
RAMIUS Impossible. We are ordered to maintain strict radio silence. 
(TO IOGINOV) That will be all, Comrade. Glad to be anywhere else, Loginov returns to his work. 
PETROV Captain, perhaps I should keep Putin's key until -- 
RAMIUS 
(SHARPLY) I suggest you return to sick bay, Doctor. Soon, I will address the crew and explain our orders. This is not a decision for discussion. Shrugging, Petrov disappears. Borodin and Ramius.. follow him. Freaked, Loginov watches them go. 
CUT TO: 
MANCUSO bent over Jones' shoulder in the Da11as' sonar shack, concentrating on the blinking light on the sonar display. Thompson's to his left. Jones is on a headset: 
JONES 
(LISTENING) He's holding steady on zero-two-zero, twelve knots at about ten thousand yards. 
MANCUSO Can you identify him?

THOMPSON Fleet hasn't said a word about it. 
MANCUSO Alright. Start a f]e on his, Jonesy. For now, call his Sierra thirty-five. (.Leaving) r91 see if we can work in a little closer and sniff his out. Thompson fcDows Mancuso. Beaumont glances at Jones, whispering: 
BEAUMONT Won't the Soviets hear us? 
JONES Not if we stay in his baffles, seaman Beaumont. Not if we stay in his baffles. Come in behind his propeller and he's deaf as a post.

RAMIUS Down scope. 
(TURNING) Any. sonar contacts? 
KAMAROV Sonar is clear, Captain. 
RAMIUS All right. rm going to address the crew. Ramius grabs the whip telephone. Jaw set, his eyes blaze with

THROUGHOUT THE BOAT In the torpedo room, engineering, wardroom and the Conn, the ANTHEM GROWS LOUDER and LOUDER. Caught in the moment, Ramius JOINS the CHORUS. 
CUT TO: 
MANCUSO sticking his head into sonar. The COB and Beaumont are on pins and needles. Jones is working his computer furiously. 
MANCUSO it did what? 
JONES It disappeared, sir. 
MANCUSO t a d) What are you talking about? Check your gear. 
JONES Running diagnostics, now, Captain. Jones is starting to sweat. He runs his tests. Nothing. urning, he stares blankly at Mancuso: 
JONES (CONT'D) Sonar is working, sir. The Russian just disappeared. One minute he was steady four thousand yards off our bow and then he was gone. And r a second, I thought I heard... well ;--

CAPTAIN VIXTOR TUPOLEV ]ate-thirties, intense, leans over a navigator tab] e. A blond man with a clipboard approaches. He is 
LIEUTENANT ANDREI BONAVIA early-thfrties, Tupolev's executive officer. This Conn is smaller than Red . October's and the weird vibes perfectly reflect the rampant paranoia of the Commander: 
BONAVIA Captain Tupolev? 
TUPOLEV What is it2l 
BONAVIA St M no sign of Red October, sir. I think we should surface and contact Red Fleet Command. 
TUPOLEV To what purpose? 
BONAVIA To inform them Red October has not appeared. 
TUPOLEV What makes you think she hasn't? Tupolev glides to a quartermaster's station. Following him, Bonavia's stomach growls. 
TUPOLEV Has it occurred to you that Red October may already be in position? That Ramius is merely hiding behind his silent drive? Waiting for me to break radio silence and make a fool of myself? 
BONAVIA 
(FRUSTRATED) 
BUT - 
TUPOLEV I will not break radio silence. We wilt lie here quietly for a few more hours. If Ramius hasn't arrived by then, I'll contact Red Fleet Command. 
A LOBBY decorated with secretaries and suits, all, in quiet motion. At speed, Ryan trues to keep up with Greer: 
RYAN I got a line on the doors. You know what they are? Greer doesn't answer. Impatient, Ryan follows him into 
AN ELEVATOR Greer pushes a button marked SUB LEVEL FOUR. Turning to Ryan: 
GREER A silent propulsion system. - 
RYAN 
(CHAGRINED) How did -? 
GREER Captain of the sub we had following her radioed in. Thing up and disappeared right in front of him. But that isn't the half of it. Read. He hands Ryan a sheaf of message flimsies. The descending elevator stops. Doors open. Ryan reads. Greer leaves. Realizing he's been left behind, Ryan takes off, entering 
A SUBTERRANEAN CORRIDOR Reading and walking, Ryan does his best to keep up with Greer: 
RYAN Jesus... ! This is unbelievable. 
(TURNING PAGES) The Kirov, too. They've sortled their whale bloody fleet! 
GREER About the size of it. Glancing up from his reading, Ryan notices a sign at the end of the 
CORRIDOR:

RYAN Where're we going anyway? 
GREER 
(F IG) Brle$ng Jeffrey Pelt. The. President's National Security Advisor. Most of the Joint Chiefs will be there. Along with a few other people. 
RYAN Who's giving the brieefing? 
GREER You are. 
RYAN 
(WIDE-EYED) 
BUT 
GREER The yeoman'fl have the slides all, laid out. AIL you have to do -- 
Ten feet ahead, Greer realizes Ryan's no longer faUowing. Stopping, he comes back: 
GREER (CONT'D) Look. No one knows this material better than you do. Give him a rundown on the sub and a precis of the stuff in your hand. He's liable to ask some direct questions. Give him direct answers and say what you think. Yowll do fine. Come on. Ryan takes a deep breath. 
JUMP CUT TO: 
RYAN FOLLOWING GREER into the White House Briefing Room. Joint Chiefs are gathered around a thirty foot conference table. Greer introduces Ryan to a GENERAL and an ADMIRAL, then mingles. Left alone, Ryan spot, a lectern at the foot of the tabl. Nearby, a yeoman tends a slide machine, an overhead projector and a large bulletin board. Ryan heads for the lectern. The yeoman has a list of slides, some photos and mustrations. Trying to gather his thoughts, Ryan steps behind the lectern. 
JEFFREY PELT the President's National Security Advisor arrives. In his mid-mss, wearing wire-rim spectacles, Pelt's nearsighted, brOliant and a crackerjack poker player. Generals and Admirals take their places. Pelt site at the head of the tabl, turning to Greer: 
PELT Let's get started. 
GREER Yes, sir. The preliminary briefing today w M be handled by Dr. Jack Ryan. I believe you've seen some of his :work. 
PELT 
(TO RYAN) You may begin. Taking a sip of water, Ryan nods at the yeoman. Projector is 
TURNED ON: 
RYAN Gentlemen, the last twenty four hours have seen some extraordinary Soviet naval activity. The first to sail was -- 
(SLIDE) this ship, the Red October. A variant of the typhoon class, she's some six hundred fifty feet long. Thirty-two thousand tons submerged displacement, roughly the size of a World War II aircraft Carrier. 
(BEAT) Unlike the standard typhoon, equipped to fire long-range missiles from Russian waters, Red October carries fifty-six SS-311s, which is a short-range attack mis it with eight independent warheads. That's four hundred forty-eight warheads all spedfically designed to fire close in. 
(ANOTHER SLIDE) We believe these doors on the bow, and here again on the stern, enclose a magneto-hydrodynamic drive, or caterpillar, which may allow the sub to run totally silent. 
(ANOTHER SLIDE) it is possible this new drive system allowed the captain, a man named Marko 
RAMIUS - Ryan points out two photos on a bulletin board. One is of Ramius alone. The other is a wedding photo of Ramius and a beautiful woman. 
ADMIRAL Four days. 
PELT Alright. I'll brief the President. That will, be all, gentlemen. 
(BEAT) Dr. Ryan. Would you stay for a moment, please? Everyone gets up to leave. As Greer rises, he winks at Ryan: 
GREER I said speak your mind, Jack, but 
JESUS -- shaking his head, Greer pats Ryan's shoulder and leaves. Ryan's mouth is dry. Pelt gets up: 
PELT You slammed the door on the General pretty hard, Jack. 
RYAN It wasn't my intention, sir - 
PELT 
(GRINNING) Yes it was. He was patronizing you and you stomped on him. In my opinion, he deserved It. 
(BEAT) Look, I'm a politk:ian, Jack. That means I'm a liar, a cheat and when I'm nvt kissing babies I'm stealing their lallipops. But it also means I know people and keep my options open. 
(BEAT) Let's assume for a minute that you're right and he intends to defect What do you think we should do? 
RYAN Well, somebody has to go out and try- - to contact him. 
PELT OK. When can you leave? 
RYAN 
(FLUSHED) Wait a minute. The General was right. I'm just an analyst -- 
PELT Perfect. I can't ask any of these chaï¿½tacters to go. None of them would volunteer putting their reputations on the line. And anyway, none of them are expendable. 
(RYAN FROWNS) IR]. give you three days to prove your theory, after that we won't have any choice but to hunt Ramius down and blow him away. Will, you do it? Ryan stares at Pelt. 
CUT TO:

TUPOLEV Mother of God.

TUPOLEV The entire Soviet Fleet has been ordered to hunt Ramius down and destroy him. And where were we? Out of contact. Dead in the water! 
BONAVIA But, Captain. Have you forgotten that it was you who -

LIEUTENANT ALEXANDER MELEKHIN forties, grey eyes, Red October's engineer. At the door 
ENSIGN IVAN STADNYUK nervous, twenties, Asiatic, locks a dead bait, securing the wardroom. Tension is elect_ic, palpable. 
LIEUTENANT VIKTOR TBILISI thirties, curly brown hair, Red October's sonar offer, stares at Ramius, anxious to get something off his chest: 
T BILLSI Before we begin, Captain. I would like to know exactly what happened to Putin? 
(BEAT) He didn't slip on his tea. Did he? 
RAMIUS No, Vlktor. Visibly shaken, Stadnyuk waves his hands: 
STADNYUK Captain? 
RAMIUS There is no way we could have accomplished our task with Putin aboard. He would have stopped us. 
T BILISI I have no objections to eliminating him. He was a pig. But it's a decision we should all have made. 
BORODIN You're not in command. 
T BILISI Don't give me that command garbage, Vasily. This is no ordinary cruise. We're all risking our lives. Everything that happens affects-each of us. 
PILOT 
(INTO HEADSET) You have permission to shift aircraft control. 
(TO COPILOT) Ask God for forgiveness, Comrade. 
IN THE FUSELAGE of the Foxtrot, Ama1ric enters a program on his keyboard. Watching it lock in, he announces: 
AMALRIC 
(INTO HEADSET) Computer is now in control, of aircraft. 
IN THE SKY the Foxtrot levels off. Bomb bay doors inch open, revealing a torpedo, sixteen inches in diameter and eight feet long. As the plane's nose dips, the torpedo relaasee. parachute opening behind, a thousand pounds of doomsday device dive earthward at dizzying speed, splashing into choppy sea. 
ON RED OCTOBER in the Conn, Ramius listens to SONAR on AUDIO. Faint PINGS appear, growing inexorably LOUDER, more FREQUENT, the submariner's worst nightmare: 
TBILISI (VO) 
(ON SPEAKERS) High speed screw l Torpedo in the water! 
RAMIUS 
(INTO MIKE) Torpedo room, this is the Captain. Launch counter-measure. The Conn SHUDDERS. Metal GRINDS. Within moments, a second PINGING Is added to that of the TORPEDO on AUDIO. 
TORPEDO ROOM (VO) 
(ON SPEAKER) Captain, this is the torpedo room. Counter-measure has been launched. 
IN THE WATER outskle Red October. The counter-measure, a device similar to a torpedo, designed to confuse acoustic homing mechanisms, spins away Pram Red October on high-speed screws. 
ON RED OCTOBER in the Conn, torpedo and counter-measure PING LOUDLY on ship's SPEAKERS. Cool as ice, Ramius turns to Kamarov, at dive control: 
RAMIUS Bottom the ship. 
STADNYUK Wait! Leaving his quartermaster's station, Stadnyuk stands on shaky legs between Ramius and Kamarov: 
STADNYUK (CONT'D) The bottom is five hundred meters down. We9l be crushed! 
RAMIUS You're relieved of your duties, Ivan! Return to your quarters. 
(BEAT) Now! Amplified PINGS. Torpedo's getting CLOSER. The counter-measure is MOVING AWAY. Waiting until. Stadnyuk has gone, Ramius turns to the Kamarov: 
RAMIUS (CONT'D) Bottom the damn ship! 
IN THE WATER Tanks flooding, Red October dives into the abyss.. Beyond, in the clammering dark, the torpedo hurtles relentlessly forward, death on wheels. 
IN THE FUSELAGE of the Foxtrot, Amalrk listens to the torpedo: 
AMALRIC 
(ON HEADSET) Weapon has locked onto target and is homing. 
ON RED OCTOBER:. in the Conn, men bang on. Everything is at a forty-five degree down angle. Kamarov watches a depth gauge plummet. 
KAMAROV Four hundred meters. Bulkheads CRACK under tons of pressure. Torpedo and counter- measure'. PING on AUDIO. Red October dives under the torpedo. it misses the safl by inches. Lacking a target, it automatically initiates a wide turn to the left. 
IN THE FUSELAGE of the Foxtrot,. Amaltic reports the torpedo's progress, vaice f lat: 
AMALRIC 
(INTO HEADSET) Torpedo has lost contact. 
(LISTENING) Searching. 
ON RED OCTOBER in the Conn, men hang on as the ship dives deeper. Kamarov watches the depth gauge creep into a red zone. Torpedo PINGS are farther APART, Less FREQUENT. 
TBIISSI (VO) 
(ON SPEAKERS) Torpedo has passed over us. It's hunting for a target. 
KAMAROV 
(READING) Four hundred fifty meters. Estimate bottom at five hundred meters. AIL eyes are fixed on the depth gauge. Bulkheads POP. A saltwater relief valve EXPLODES. BLASTED in the fame with WATER, a HELMSMAN leaps to his feet, SCREAMING: 
HELMSMAN We're flooding! Expressinnless, Kamarov slams him back to his chair and shuts down the relief valve. The spray stops: 
KAMAROV Keep your teeth on the shelf, boy. Nobody's flooding. 
(INTO INTERCOM ) Conn, sonar. Negative, Captain. 
COB Where is your phantom Russian sub, Jonesy? According to your calcuiatÂ£ons we ' should have picked him up hours ago. 
JONES He's close. I can feel it. 
COB Close don't count in anything but horseshoes and hand grenades. Beaumont CHORTLES. Jones glances at him: 
JONES Don't encourage the man, seaman Beaumont. He's very old. 
COB- The hell, you say. 
JONES You're an old man, COB. Way over the ham. Your trout is so wrinkled it's about to faU off. 
COB Screw you. 
JONES Speaking of which, what happened to that Hustler Magazine that was in the head? 
COB 
(BLANCHING) Don't start on that crap. Beaumont grins. The C O 8 and Jones are everything he hoped the Navy would be: 
BEAUMONT 
(M AY) What Hustler magazine? 
JONES For many months, seaman Beaumont, there was a Hustler magazine located in the crew's head. it was community property. 
(WORKING SONAR) Then one day, it disappeared. The ..COB. here was the last person seen entering the head before it vanished. 
BEAUMONT Where'd it' go? 
COB 
(SQUIRMING) Come on, Jonesy. 
JONES I have a theory, seaman Beaumont. I believe the CO B Is like a black widow, spider. After he has sex with a magazine, he eats it. Beaumont HOWLS. The COB turns pink. 
COS Goddam you, Jonesy -- 
JONES 
(RAISING HIS 
HAND) Wait! Jones the tunes a dial. In the distance, barely di i nguishahle through transient NOISE, the sound of RUSTLING WATER followed by a fleeting HUM. 
CUT TO: 
PAINTER Leaning over a status board in the Combat Information Center on the Kennedy. Replete with lights, the status board reveals details of force deployment. Ryan enters, carrying copse: 
RYAN Morning, Admiral. 
PAINTER Sleep well? 
RYAN Like the dead. (re: status board) Our friends have been busy. 
PAINTER During the night, they positioned most of their front line submarines at barrier stations between Greenland and Iceland. Here, here and here. 
(PIG) The majority of their Northern Fleet surface vessels are moving in a line abreast through here. 
(BEAT) It's an old anti submaxlne tactic. Like beaters in the jungle making a lot of noise, driving the prey into the guns of waiting hunters. 
(PIG) One of our submarines, the Da71as, reports intermittent contact with Red October and is positioned here at the bottom of Red Route One. With luck, the Dallas will inte pt her. 
RYAN Could you get me aboard the Dallas? 
PAINTER We could fly you out there in a helicopter. But I don't think you'd like that much. 
RYAN- 
(ASHEN) No other way? 
PAINTER That's all there is, I'm afraid. Putting down his coffee cup, Ryan stares at the status board. A sal]ci r arrives with a message. Reading it, Painter glances at Ryan: 
PAINTER (CONT'D) DaIlas found Red October and is backing her now. Locking eyes with Painter, Ryan grits his teeth. 
RYAN 
THUNDERING ROTORS on a SH-3 on the Kennedy's flight deck. Ryan and Davenport move to the waiting chopper. Davenport SHOUTS: 
DAVENPORT The Dallas picked up Red October and is tracking her again. The Admiral issued orders for her to fall back and pick you up. Davenport takes Ryan's arm. 
DAVENPORT (CONT'D) Ryan, listen to me. Getting someone on a sub is a nightmare. The Admiral told me what happened to you in the Mediterranean. The next hour could be very rough. Ryan ftroes a grin. A sax7or helps him into the helicopter. Davenport steps back. ROTORS ACCELERATE. 
CUT TO: 
JEFF PELT in his chair in his office in the Executive Office Building. Sitting on the couch in precisely the same position as when they last talked, Ambassador Lysenko wipes his brow: 
LYSENKO The weather in Washington is so unpredictable, don't you think? 
PELT How can I help you, Ambassador? 
LYSENKO I'm afraid there's been a pew development. 
(PAUSE) Apparently, the initial reports that one of our submarines was missing were not completely accurate. 
(PELT IS silent), The. submarine in question, Red October, is commanded' by a Captain Marko Ramius Apparently r he has suffered some kind of a nervous breakdown... 
(SWEATING) He -posted a letter just before he announcing his intentions to fire his mis' it at the United Stat s. Pelt stares at Lysenko. Lysenko shifts his weight. _ The Russian finds Pelt's steadyâ¢.gaze unnerving: 
PELT Why didn't you tell me this the last time we met? 
LYSENKO In my position, I'm sometimes compromised by the fact that Moscow doesn't tea me everything. 
PELT So one of your submarine captains has gone insane? 
(LYSENKO NODS) What is it you want from us? 
LYSENKO The other day you offered your assistance 
PELT The other day it was a rescue mission. You want us to help you hunt Ramius down and kill. him? 
LYSENKO Because American lives are at stake, I've been instructed to ask your President for precisely that. 
(SWALLOWING) Since you were so adamant about the consequences of confusion, I thought we might ask him together. 
PELT I understand. Pelt picks up the phone. 
CUT TO: 
BROKEN SUNSHINE dappling a choppy sea. Ice-cold WIND whips whitecapped waves and lashes the horizon. The helicopter with Ryan aboard circles into view. 
IN THE CHOPPER HOWLING. NOISE. PILOT and COPILOT navigate tricky winds.. TWO SAILORS crouch by an open door, checking a harness on Ryan. Tuiindng to the pi ot, the copilot BELLOWS: 
COPILOT no contact with the Da'Ha! 
# (READING GAUGE) Fuel capacity is in the red! 
PILOT We can't wait any Unger! 
COPILOT Hang on. I have contact! 
PILOT OK. Tell them to surface. 
(RE: RYAN) Hook him up! But hurry, we don't have much fuel left! Sai],or threads cable through a winch by the door. Ryan's white as a ghost. NOISE Is DEAFENING. Another saï¿½ar belts a harness to Ryan's back. Ryan peers down. Wind from the rotors crushes the waves. Between his feet, Ryan can see the small white wake from a periscope. 
ON THE DALLAS in the Conn, Mancuso spins the scope. Thompson watches him. Both he and Mancuso wear life jackets: 
MANCUSO Whoever this guy is, he's in far one hell of a ride. 
( NG) Officer of the deck. Surface the ship. A flurry of activity in the Conn. The Dallas prepares to surface. Mancuso and Thompson move to a hatch by the helm. 
IN THE CHOPPER the saftors i nish strapping Ryan into the sling. One of them leans forward, painting to a ]ever on Ryan's chest, SHOUTING: 
SAILOR Pull this to release! Fighting. panic, Ryan glances down. A mitlion miles below, the sea bans- mine-grey. 
ON THE DALLAS sail in the Conn work like lightning in cramped quarters. A petty afâ¬'lcer straps Mancuso and Thompson into harnesses. 
MANCUSO You got a man dangling at the end of a line with no paint of reference and helicopter rotors generating enough static electak ty that we have to ground him or it! l be like grabbing a hot wire and if he falls in the water the only way to get him out is with divers 'cause most of the ship's underwater. 
(PAUSE) Fun? 
THOMPSON 
(G NING) Why I joined the Navy. A sager hands Mancuso a phone for the bridge. 
ON THE DALLAS BEDLAM in the CONN. STACCATO orders. Mancuso helps Thompson through the hatch. Hell on wheels, Mancuso disappears down a passageway. 
IN THE WATER Jones and Ryan ride waves by the curved hull. of the ship. Jones offers Ryan his mouthpiece. 
RYAN Wait a minute! 
JONES Listen, you son-af-a-bit h. I'm only gonna tell you once. Stick this fucking thing in your mouth and breathe! Ryan takes the mouthpiece, inhaling and exhaling rapidly. The helicopter circles above. Jones drags Ryan 
UNDER THE WATER into bruised silence. Pulling themselves downward along the Dalla rolling hull, Ryan and Jones share oxygen. 
IN THE ESCAPE TRUNK Ryan and Jones pull themselves inside. Blazing light ignites a fire storm of one-caned organisms. Eyes wide, Ryan watches Jones c3 se the hatch. Jones starts draining the trunk. Everything slows down. Echoes REVERBERATE. The water level in the trunk drops and the 
SHRIEK OF PRESSURIZED AIR ASSAULTS Ryan's EARDRUMS. Hurling the mouthpiece. away, he gulps air in the rapidly draining trunk like a banked trout. 
IN THE HALLWAY outside the trunk, Mancuso and crew open the hatch. Tumbling out, Ryan stands; on shaky legs, excited, babbling: 
RYAN Jesus Christ! I cant believe it! Jesus Christ --Â» 
MANCUSO Take it easy -- 
RYAN When I hit the water, it was like Ice. I thought I was going to freeze -- 
MANCUSO Slow down. You're hypervent it sting. 
(RYAN BLINKS) Now, who are you? 
RYAN 
(DISORIENTED) Sorry. I'm Jack Ryan. Are you Captain Mancuso? Mancuso nods. The radioman appears with another message. Mancuso rips it open and starts reading it. Ryan rockets into 
PRESENT TIME: 
RYAN (CONT'D) Captain, we have to find the Red October. She's a Russian -- 
MANCUSO 
(READING) I already found him, Ryan. Then I was ordered to pick you up. 
RYAN - 
(QUIC)DY) We have to find him again. The Captain is going to defect and - 
MANCUSO What the hell are you yammering about? 
RYAN I have to talk to - 
MANCUSO Mr. Thompson. Get this man some dry clothes and coffee. 
RYAN 
BUT CAPTAIN 
MANCUSO I'Il be in the Conn. 
JUMP CUT TO: at the entrance of the sonar shack, fifteen minutes later. Behind him, in the Conn, the crew is preparing to man battle stations. Jones has returned to sonar. 
MANCUSO 
(TO JONES) Any sign that he's alerted to our presence? 
JONES No, sir, captain. operating as before. 
Ryan appears in dry clothes. Mancuso ignores him. The of5cer of the deck turns to Mancuso: 
OOD Captain. Battle stations are manned. 
MANCUSO Very well. 
RYAN What do you mean battle stations? 
(URGENTLY) Look, I've been authorized by the President of the United States to talk to the Captain of Red October. Mancuso takes the last message from his pocket: 
MANCUSO And I have been ordered to blow him out of the water if he stays on a course to the United States or demonstrates any hostile intentions. 
RYAN 
(STUNNED) I don't understand. 
(NO ANSWER) Captain, shall I flood the tubes? 
RAMIUS (after a beat) No. Lock the (ring solution into computer. Do not flood the tubes. 
CUT TO: 
MANCUSO on the DaIIas in the Conn. Eyeing Ryan, Mancuso opens a mike: 
MANCUSO What's he doing, Jonesy? Has he l f ooded his tubes? 
JONES Negative, Captain. He's just matting there. Hold on -- 
(BEAT) Hull popping. Target's coming shallow. Mancuso frowns. The crew's a cased spring. Ryan's walking on 
RAZOR BLADES: 
RYAN What does it mean? 
MANCUSO It means, he's a very cool customer, 
YOUR RUS sian. He knows we're here and that we are ready to fire. But he's not going to provoke us. He's heading to periscope depth to see what's on the surface. 
(TO THOMPSON) What's his course, now? 
THOMPSON 
(READING) Target is on course north. 
MANCUSO 
(TO- HELMSMAN) Right ten degrees rudder. Steer course north. 
(BEAT) Sonar, Conn. Report all contacts. 
JONES Conn, sonar. My only contact is Sierra thirty-five, Red October. Bearing two- seven-zero. 
MANCUSO Conn, aye. Fire control, range to target? 
THOMPSON Range is three hundred yards. 
MANCUSO Diving oar make your depth sixty- f f ve feet. 
(TO RYAN) He wants to go up and take a peek, we'll play along. 
ON THE SURFACE Grey sky. Frothy sea. Red October's periscope appears. Seconds later, three hundred yards away, the Dalla' scope breaks the surface. 
ON RED OCTOBER Ramius is glued to the eyepiece of his periscope. He spots the Dallas' scope in the water. Behind him, sailors are tense, wary. Uncomfortable, Borodin sweats at fire control. 
RAMIUS 
(ON SCOPE) Weapons status? 
BORODIN Weapons are armed. Tubes one and two are not ficoded. 
RAMIU S 
(AT SCOPE) Mark this bearing. 
QUARTERMASTER Bearing zero-nine-zero. in the Conn, Mancuso is glued to his scope just like Ramius. Ryan can hear his heart nq: 
MANCUSO All right, Mr. Ryan. You wanted to:. talk to him. There he is. What do you want to say? Ryan chooses his words carefully. As he does, Mancuso hits a periscope light in morse: 
RYAN American government told you intend to launch mis. lc s. Do not approach U.S. coast. Repeat. Do not approach U.S. coast, or you .w>7 . be attacked. If you understand, ping once. 
(TO MANCUSO) He can do that, can't he? 
MANCUSO He can do that. But is he gonna do that? 
ON RED OCTOBER in the Conn, Ramius is still at. the scope, watching the light in the Dalla' periscope. After a moment, he, glances at Borodin: 
RAM=S Verify the range again. 
(BEAT) Ping one time only. 
ON THE DALLAS in the Conn, Mancuso's at the scope. Ryan is scribbling something on a pad. Sailors hear a PING. Thompson grins. 
MANCUSO I'D. be dammed. 
IN THE CIC Curry coordinates information. AIL around him, men work intensely. Curry turns to one of the shadows: 
CURRY Seahawk One reports torpedo is launched and running normally at forty knots. I have it on sonar. 
(TURNING) Four hundred yards from drop paint. Eight hundred yards. Twelve hundred yards. One of the shadows leans forward and presses a button on Curry's console. The button is marked Command Control Detonate. The 
SHADOW IS 
ADMIRAL GREER in a white uniform and cap. Beside him, Skip Tyler, leans on his cane, concentrating on Curry's display. 
IN THE HELICOPTER Pilot studies the sea. Suddenly, it BULGES. Loud CONCUSSION. Shock WAVE. A giant mushroom cap rises from the depths as gas bubbles vent. 
ON THE FANTAIL Petrov watches in horror as a huge concave impression vents below the helicopter. A huge plume of gas and water erupts skyward. 
IN THE CIC aboard the frigate, Curry turns to Greer: 
CURRY Torpedo has detonated. 
GREER And you understand, Lieutenant. I was never here. That torpedo did not self-destruct. It hit the target. Right? 
(CURRY NODS) Now, Contact the Dallas and tell them to proceed. Curry nods. 
CUT TO: 
MANCUSO in the Conn aboard the Dallas with Thompson. Mancuso has a .45 in a holster on his belt. Thompson reads a message: 
THOMPSON Frigate reports phase one completed, Captain. We are ordered to proceed. 
MANCUSO OK. Now comes the weird part. Thompson fo lows Mancuso out of the Conn into 
A PASSAGEWAY running aft. Mancuso and Thompson move at speed. Mancuso is far 
FROM HAPPY: 
MANCUSO I don't like leaving the boat, Phil. But the orders are specific. 
THOMPSON We're gonna be f ne. Rounding a corner, they start 
DOWN A LADDER Thompson will never get over how fast Mancuso can move. Aren't guys that big supposed to be slow? 
MANCUSO This has got to be the craziest stunt I've ever heard of. There's only about two ml]]k n things that can st]l. go wrong. At the bottom of the ladder, they enter 
A PASSAGEWAY Ahead of them Jones and Ryan wait by a ladder beneath an open hatch. Like Mancuso, Jones is armed. Jones starts up the ladder. Ryan follows. Mancuso turns to Thompson: 
MANCUSO Listen. If anything -- 
THOMPSON Captain. We'll be all right. Mancuso climbs up the ladder, disappearing through the hatch. Thompson closes it. 
CUT TO: 
WARRANT OFFICER STEINER sitting before a wheel at a brightly lit panel, just as cocky as when we last saw him in the mini sub at Tyler's lab. Next to him, a COPILOT checks a clipboard. Behind them, Jones, Ryan and Mancuso climb up through a hatch. Jones shuts it. Steiner speaks into a headset:: 
STEINER OX. Passengers are aboard. Check-off complete. Request clearance to lift-off. 
(TURNING) Gentlemen, we have clearance. Fasten your belts and grab your nuts. We're taking a ride. Ryan sits opposite Mancuso. Jones is to Mancuso's right. The bulkhead rocks slightly. Steiner turns a yoke. 
STEINER (CONT'D) Battery sperm? 
COPILOT Eighty percent capacity. Homing beacon is five degrees to the right. Recommend new course zero-seven-five. Range now five hundred yards. 
STEINER Roger. Coming right to course zero-seven- ive. Make initial preparations to land. The copilot starts toggling switches. Behind him, Mancuso checks the .45 in his holster. Ryan watches. 
COPILOT Contact is two hundred yards below. One hundred yards ahead. 
STEINER Roger. 
(BEAT) Hit the running lights. 
IN THE WATER -black on black. Then, in a single blinding flash of light 
THE RED OCTOBER is revealed. Hovering above it, floodlights blazing, the DSRV. Descending, it locks onto a hatch by the sail. 
IN THE DSRV Copilot turns to Steiner: 
COPILOT We have a seal. Skirt is dry. 
STEINER Roger. Open the hatch. Getting up, the copilot heads for the hatch. 
THOMPSON What's the status of Red October? 
BEAUMONT Dead in the water. 
THOMPSON They can't maneuver with the goddam DSRV stuck to them. 
(WHISPERING) Come on, Mancuso, move it. Get the hell out of there. 
ON RED OCTOBER BEDLAM in the Conn. Tba'lisi and Jones are on their way to sonar. Ramius SHOUTS at Melekhin: 
RAMIUS Get back to engineering and give me some power! 
(TO MANCUSO 
RE: DSRV) Get that damn thing off my boat. Mancuso's halfway up the ladder. He spots Steiner peeking down at 
HIM: 
STEINER I think somebody just shot a torpedo at us! 
MANCUSO No shit, buckwheat. Get the hell. out of here! 
STEINER 
(STUNNED) Where am I supposed -- Mancuso SLAMS the HATCH. Scrambling down the ladder, Mancuso hears Ramius bel]Dwing at Borodin who is manning the helm: 
RAMIUS No, Vasily. I need you in fire control. We must track whoever's out there. Borodin heads for fre control. Ramius tosses Ryan into the chair behind the helm : 
RAMIUS (CONT'D) You sit here! 
RYAN 
BUTICAN'T -- 
RAMIUS Do exactly as I tell you! Stunned, Ryan grabs the helm. Jones and Tbilisi, must have made it to sonar. Speakers CRACKLE: 
JONES (VO) 
(ON SPEAKERS) DSRV is away. There's a Russian Akula about eight thousand yards starboard. 
TBILISI (VO) 
(ON SPEAKERS) It's the Konovalov. 
RAMIUS 
(TO RYAN) All ahead flank! 
RYAN 
(PANIC)DNG) I told you I'm just an analyst. I write books. 
RAMIUS - 
(LEANING FORWARD) Turn that knob all the way to the right. Ryan: does. AIL around him the world is going stark raving mad. Again, SPEAKERS CRACKLE: 
JONES (VO) 
(ON SPEAKERS) Torpedo in the water. High speed screws. Beaming zero-two-zero. I estimate range at about eight thousand yards. 
RAMIUS 
(TO RYAN) Turn the helm to the heft. Steer course zero-two-zero. 
MANCUSO 
(TO RAMIUS) Wait a minute! That's heading into the t o rpedo. You should turn away from it. 
JONES (VO) 
(ON SPEAKERS) Steady bearing to the weapon. Still zero-two-zero. Range about seven thousand yards. 
RAMIUS 
(TO RYAN) Turn that helm to the left until the dial says course zero-two-zero. 
MANCUSO No! That's wrong. Ryan, don't turn that goddam wheel! Ryan stares at Mancuso then at Ramius. Deciding, he turns the helm left, coming to course zero-two-zero. 
RYAN What happened? 
MANCUSO Combat tack, Mr. Ryan. By turning into the torpedo,, Ramius closed the distance before it could arm itself. I never would have thought of it. 
RYAN So we're safe? 
RAMIUS Not yet. Right now, the Soviet Captain, a man named Tupolev is removing the safety features on all his weapons. He won't make the same mistake twice. Behind Ramius, Ryan spots a SHADOW at the rear of the Conn. He can't believe his eyes. The goddam shadow has a pistol in hand. 
SUDDENLY: 
A FIRE STORM of GUNFIRE sprays the CONN. Everybody scatters. Borodin is HIT. SLAMMING into the bulkhead, he falls in a seated position, eyes wide. Fire control panel EXPLODES. Behind a console, Mancuso drags out his .45 and RETURNS FIRE. The shadow disappears. 
ON THE DALLAS Beaumont rips off his headgear, turning to Thompson in the sonar shack's door, breathing hard: 
BEAUMONT Jesus Christ. Gunge. 
THOMPSON Gunfire? 
ON THE KONOVALOV in the Conn, Tupa]av is furious. He YELLS at Bonavia: 
TUPOLEV Hurry up goddammit! I want all the enabling devices disconnected! 
BONAVIA Captain, I cannot go any faster. 
ON RED OCTOBER in the Conn, cars crawl from hiding. Sparks ERUPT from WIRES. Fire contra is history. Ramius leans over Borodin: 
BORODIN I would have like to have seen Montana. And the Indians. (eyes gT'âºg) captain? - _. He dies. RAGING, Ramius POUNDS the BULKHEAD. Kamarov notices a light on a panel: 
KAMAROV He's in the missile compartment! 
RAMIUS 
(TO MANCUSO) The ship is yours. 
MANCUSO But the control is blasted to hell. I can't shoot. 
RAMIUS Then get behind him and stay there. Don't let him put you in his sights or we're all dead. Mancuso tosses Ramius his .45. Catching it, Ramius splits. Ryan follows. 
CUT TO: 
TUPOLEV a caged tiger in the Conn on the Konovalov. Bonavia turns, looking back at him : 
BONAVIA Enabling devices are removed. 
TUPOLEV 
ABOUT TIMEL 
(INTO MIKE) Sonar, give me a bearing on Red October. 
SONAR (VO) 
(ON SPEAKERS) She's taken position behind us. 
TUPOLEV Damn. 
(TO HELM) Left full rudder. T11 shake him loose. 
ON RED OCTOBER in a passageway outside a door to the missile compartment, Ramius and Ryan hug the bulkhead: 
RAMIUS He'll break into a panel and short -circuit the wiring on a missile. We'll be blown to pieces. Taking a deep breath, Ryan follows Ramiais into the 
MISSILE COMPARTMENT coming face-too-face with a BARRAGE of GUNFIRE. Ramius is HIT. Ryan drags him into a space behind an electrical panel. Mercifully, the shooting STOPS. Ryan checks Ramius. His shoulder's a mess. Mind riling, Ryan studies his surroundings. He's never felt so alone. The compartment is vast, dominated by twenty tussle tubes six feet 
in diameter. Overhead, a catwalk. At the aft end, somebody's working with a wrench. 
RAMIUS We must stop him before he gets into a panel.. Ryan stares at Ramius. Ramiii isn't gonna stop anybody. Resigned, Ryan finds the .45 Mancuso gave him in his pocket, 
MUMBLING: 
RYAN 
(TO HIMSELF) Next time memos. Only memos. 
RAMIUS Be careful what you shoot at in here, Ryan. The compartment is very sensitive. In a daze, Ryan starts walking aft, still MUMBLING: 
RYAN Be careful what you shoot at, Ryan. Very sensitive.. .in here... 
TUPOLEV Got him. Match bearings and the. 
BONAVIA We are too close. I have to set 
TUPOLEV Shoot now! Tupolev pulls the lever himself. 
ON RED: OCTOBER': in the : Conn, Mancuso, Kamarov and the others are on pins and needles. What next? Suddenly, they hear PIN GIN G. 
JONES (VO) 
(ON SPEAKERS) Launch transient astern. He's shooting again. Very close. 
MANCUSO Left full rudder! 
JONES 
(LOUDER PINGS) Weapon is alive. 
(LOUDER PINGS) It has acquired. Sound of torpedo passing close to the hull: 
JONES (VO CONT'D) 
(ON SPEAKERS) Weapon passed close aboard. Is Ong re-attack. Hold on. It's reacquired. But not on us! Ryan appears with Ramius aft of the Conn. Pinging grows QUIETER, more DISTANT. 
ON THE KONOVALOV in the Conn, Tupalev is suddenly confused, disorientaed by the 
PINGS. 
TUPOLEV Wait. I - 
SONAR (VO) 
(OVER SPEAKERS) Our torpedo missed Red October and is homing on us! 
TUPOLEV 
(STUNNED) How could that be? 
BONAVIA The weapon was not properly programmed. PINGS CLOSER. LOUDER. Finally, PINGS become a SPINE- TINGLTNG HOWL. Bonavia SHOUTS: 
BONAVIA (CONT'D) You stupid arrogant bastard. You've Idiled us all! 
IN THE . WATER Blinding light. The Konovalov disintegrates. Billowing pockets of gas embrace the deep. Thirty-seven hundred tons of steel. and iron rip apart in the blink of an eye. 
ON THE SURFACE a white mountain of displaced water rises into the air, compresses and explodes. 
ON THE FRIGATE in shock, the Russian crew gapes at the explosion. The young sailor who took courage from Ramius makes the sign of the cross. 
ON RED OCTOBER in the Conn, as the aftershock subsides, Ryan helps Ramius up off the floor, trying to make him comfortable against a bulkhead: 
RAMIUS Captain Tupalev has just provided your pantomime with the one thing you could never have managed. 
RYAN 
(NODDING) Wreckage. 
CUT TO: 
PELT in his office seated across from Lysenko: 
PELT With the depth of the water and the wreckage scattered over such a wide area, it we]. be a long time before anything is recovered. Your people are already interviewing the crew and making arrangements for their r turn. (Lysenko nods, 
SOBERLY) This has been a terrible tragedy, Mr. Ambassador. I can only stress that if you'd come to us earlier, it might have been avcdded. 
LYSENKO I appreciate your candor in the matter. 
PELT 
(SMOOTHLY) And I yours, Andrei.. 
LYSENKO 
(PROBING) Perhaps in the future, the technology will be available for a more thorough I n vestigation of the wreckage... 
PELT 
(STEADY) Perhaps. A long beat as the two men stare at each other. Lysenko finally breaks it off:

JUNO 
Written by 
Diablo Cody 
EXT. CENTENNIAL LANE - DUSK 
JUNO MacGUFF stands on a placid street in a nondescript subdivision, facing the curb. It's FALL. Juno is sixteen years old, an artfully bedraggled burnout kid. She winces and shields her eyes from the glare of the sun. The object of her rapt attention is a battered living room set, abandoned curbside by its former owners. There is a fetid-looking leather recliner, a chrome-edged coffee table, and a tasteless latchhooked rug featuring a roaring tiger. 
JUNO (V.O.) It started with a chair. 
INT. BLEEKER HOUSE - MOLD-O'-RIFFIC BASEMENT - NIGHT 
FLASHBACK - Juno approaches a boy hidden by shadow. He's sitting in an overstuffed chair. She slowly, clumsily lowers herself onto his lap. 
A 60's Brazilian track plays from a vintage record player. 
WHISPERED VOICE Do you know how long I've wanted this? 
JUNO Yeah. 
WHISPERED VOICE Wizard. 
EXT. CENTENNIAL LANE - CONTINUED 
A DOG barks, jarring Juno back to reality. 
JUNO Quiet, Banana. Hey, shut your gob for a second, okay? 
We see a teacup poodle tethered in the yard a few feet away from the abandoned living room set. The dog yaps again. 
JUNO (V.O.) This is the most magnificent discarded living room set I've ever seen. 
She swigs from an absurdly oversized carton of juice and wipes her mouth with the back of her hand. 
BEGIN ANIMATED TITLE SEQUENCE: 
Juno marching down various street, pumping her arms like a jogger and chugging intermittently from the huge carton of juice. We watch her breathlessly navigate suburbia, clearly on a mission. 
EXT. DRUGSTORE - DAY 
Finally, a panting Juno arrives at DANCING ELK DRUG on the main drag of her small Minnesota suburb, Dancing Elk. 
The automatic doors of the store part to reveal Juno's flushed serious face. She carelessly flings the empty juice container over her shoulder and onto the curb. A group of DROPOUTS with skateboards near the entrance glare at her. 
She enters the DRUGSTORE. 
INT. DRUGSTORE - CONTINUOUS 
ROLLO, the eccentric drugstore clerk, sneers at Juno from behind the counter. He wears a polyester uniform vest. 
ROLLO Well, well. If it isn't MacGuff the Crime Dog! Back for another test? 
JUNO I think the last one was defective. The plus sign looked more like a division sign. 
Rollo regards her with intense skepticism. 
JUNO I remain unconvinced. 
Rollo pulls the bathroom key out of reach. 
ROLLO This is your third test today, Mama Bear. Your eggo is preggo, no doubt about it! 
An eavesdropping TOUGH GIRL wearing an oversized jacket and lots of makeup gapes at Juno from the beauty aisle. 
TOUGH GIRL Three times? Oh girl, you are way pregnant. It's easy to tell. Is your nipples real brown? 
LEAH How did you even generate enough pee for three pregnancy tests? 
JUNO I drank like ten tons of Sunny Delight. Anyway, yeah. I'm pregnant. And you're shockingly cavalier. 
LEAH Is this for real? Like for real, for real? 
JUNO Unfortunately, yes. 
LEAH Oh my God! Oh shit! Phuket Thailand! 
JUNO That's the kind of emotion I was looking for in the first take. 
LEAH Well, are you going to go to Havenbrooke or Women Now for the abortion? You need a note from your parents for Havenbrooke. 
JUNO I know. Women Now, I guess. The commercial says they help women now. 
LEAH Want me to call for you? I called for Becky last year. 
JUNO Eh, I'll call them myself. But I do need your help with something very urgent. 
EXT. CENTENNIAL LANE - NIGHT 
Leah and Juno struggle to drag a recliner across a well manicured suburban lawn. They make a formidable team. 
LEAH Heavy lifting can only help you at this point. 
JUNO That is sick, man. 
Leah busts a gut laughing. It's a stunningly accurate portrayal of Bleeker's parents. 
LEAH So, you were bored? Is that how this blessed miracle came to be? 
JUNO Nah, it was a premeditated act. The sex, I mean, not getting pregnant. 
LEAH When did you decide you were going to do Bleeker? 
JUNO Like, a year ago, in Spanish class. 
INT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - SPANISH CLASS - DAY - (FLASHBACK) 
Bleeker and Juno are sitting at their desks, listening to a teacher lecturing about spanish. Bleeker discreetly pushes a POSTCARD to Juno with his foot. She picks it up off the floor, reads it, then looks at Bleeker, who is watching the teacher obediently. 
EXT. CENTENNIAL LANE - NIGHT 
LEAH Aha! You love him. 
JUNO It's extremely complicated, and I'd rather not talk about it in my fragile state. 
She hefts a coffee table with her bare hands. She's wearing her father's LIFTING BELT. 
LEAH So, what was it like humping Bleeker's bony bod? 
JUNO It was magnificent, man! 
INT. BLEEKER'S BEDROOM - MORNING 
CU of Bleeker putting on double socks in his Car-Bed. 
CU of Bleeker putting on his sweat bands. 
CU of Bleeker applying Runner's Glide. 
INT. KITCHEN - BLEEKER'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING 
CU of a CROISSANT POCKET warming in the microwave. 
EXT. BLEEKER HOUSE - MORNING 
Juno rummages through her locker, which is plastered with photos of Leah and Bleeker, plus a giant poster of Iggy Pop in his heyday. 
She grabs a dilapidated physics textbook. A few pages slip out. STEVE RENDAZO (the same asshole who harassed her as she walked to the drugstore) passes by in the hallway. 
STEVE RENDAZO Hey, your book fell apart! 
JUNO Yeah. 
STEVE RENDAZO It must have looked at your face. PWAH! 
He high-fives his klatch of buddies and moves along. 
JUNO (V.O.) The funny thing is that Steve Rendazo secretly wants me. Jocks like him always want freaky girls. Girls with horn-rimmed glasses and vegan footwear and Goth makeup. Girls who play the cello and wear Converse All-Stars and want to be children's librarians when they grow up. Oh yeah, jocks eat that shit up. 
We see Steve looking back at Juno for a brief second with mixed feelings. 
JUNO (V.O.) They just won't admit it, because they're supposed to be into perfect cheerleaders like Leah. Who, incidentally, is into teachers. 
We see Leah at the far end of the hallway, talking animatedly with a paunchy middle-aged teacher, KEITH. 
LEAH (from a distance) Me too! I love Woody Allen! 
INT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - SCIENCE LAB - DAY 
STUDENTS bustle in, as the teacher, MR. TINKER tries to maintain order. Juno heads toward her desk and sets down her bag. 
MR. TINKER People! We're doing our photomagnetism lab today, so find your partner and break out into fours. 
Juno looks up and meets eyes with her longtime lab partner: Bleeker. Sound the gong of awkwardness! 
Juno and Bleeker head separately over to an available lab station and unpack their bags in silence. 
JUNO Well! Nothing like experimenting. 
BLEEKER I did the prep questions for this lab last night. You can copy my answers if you need to. 
He slides a piece of graph paper in front of Juno without looking at her. 
JUNO Oh, I couldn't copy your work. 
BLEEKER But you copy my work every week. 
JUNO Oh yeah. I'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner, huh? 
BLEEKER I don't mind. You definitely bring something to the table. 
JUNO Charisma? 
BLEEKER Or something. 
The other two LAB PARTNERS, a humorless couple, join them at the station. 
JUNO So, who's ready for some photomagnificence? 
GIRL LAB PARTNER I have a menstrual migraine, and I can't look at bright lights today. 
GUY LAB PARTNER Amanda, I told you to go to the infirmary and lie down. You never listen. 
GIRL LAB PARTNER No Josh, I don't take orders. Not from you and not from any man. 
GUY LAB PARTNER You know, you've been acting like this ever since I went up to see my brother at Mankato. I told you, nothing happened! 
GIRL LAB PARTNER Something happened. Because your eyes? Are very cold? They're very cold, Josh. They're cold, lying eyes. 
GUY LAB PARTNER What? My eyes are not lying! 
GIRL LAB PARTNER Yes they are, Josh. Since Mankato, they have been lying eyes. 
JUNO I know. Maybe they'll canonize me for being so selfless. 
LEAH Maybe they'll totally shit and be super mad at you and not let you graduate or go to Cabo San Lucas for spring break. 
JUNO Bleeker and I were going to go to Gettysburg for spring break. 
Leah sighs, as if there's no helping her nerdy friend. 
LEAH Well, maybe you could look at one of those adoption ads. I see them all the time in the Penny Saver. 
JUNO There are ads? For parents? 
LEAH Oh yeah! "Desperately Seeking Spawn." They're right by the ads for like, iguanas and terriers and used fitness equipment. It's totally legit. 
JUNO Come on, Leah. I can't scope out wannabe parents in the Penny Saver! That's tacky. That's like buying clothes at the Pump n' Munch. 
EXT. PARK BENCH - DAY 
Juno and Leah are sitting at a bench in a park. They slurp giant blue slushies and sift through a pile of Penny Savers. 
Juno has her pipe with her. 
JUNO The Penny Saver sucks. 
LEAH Yeah, but it sucks for free. 
They turn the pages in silence for a moment. Their lips and teeth are Windex-blue. 
LEAH Look at this one "Wholesome, spiritually wealthy couple have found true love with each other." (checks to see that Juno is paying attention) "All that's missing is your bastard." 
JUNO (reading a different page) There's a guy in here who's giving away a piano. Free for the hauling! We should put it in Bleeker's yard. 
LEAH You're not listening to me. 
JUNO No, I heard you. I just can't give the baby to people who describe themselves as "wholesome." I'm looking for something a little edgier. 
LEAH What did you have in mind, a family of disturbed loners who are into gunplay and incest? 
JUNO I was thinking a graphic designer, mid-thirties, and his cool Asian wife who dresses awesome and plays bass. But I'm trying to not be too particular. 
LEAH All right, how about this one? "Healthy, educated couple seeking infant to join our family of five. You will be compensated. Help us complete the circle of love." 
JUNO Yeesh, they sound like a cult. Besides, they're greedy bitches. They already have three kids! 
LEAH Hey, Juno. Juno! Look at this one. 
She points to the paper and motions for Juno to look. Juno scans the ad silently. 
We see the ad. It contains a photo of an attractive couple with ambiguous Mona Lisa smiles. It reads "Educated, successful couple wishes to..." 
JUNO (V.O.) They were Mark and Vanessa Loring, and they were beautiful even in black and white. 
EXT. BLEEKER HOUSE - PAULIE'S WINDOW - NIGHT 
We see Paulie's bedroom window -- festooned with childish curtains -- and the light on inside. 
INT. BLEEKER'S HOUSE - PAULIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Bleeker lies on his Car-bed in his track uniform, listening to the same LP from when he and Juno went all the way. 
He stares between the pages of his embossed Dancing Elk Prep yearbook. 
We see the object of his gaze is Juno's black and white YEARBOOK PHOTO. Next to it, we see a sloppy, handwritten message from Juno. We hear Juno's voice reading the message: 
JUNO (V.O.) Hey Bleeker! Spank off to this with motion lotion. Just kidding (kind of.) Your best friend, Juno. 
Bleeker picks up the phone. It's the same HAMBURGER PHONE Juno has. He reconsiders and puts it down. 
MAC Who is the kid? 
JUNO The baby? I don't know anything about it yet. I only know it's got fingernails, allegedly. 
BREN Nails? Really? 
MAC No, I mean the father! Who's the father, Juno? 
JUNO Oh. It's, well, it's Paulie Bleeker. 
Bren and Mac burst into shocked laughter. 
JUNO What? 
MAC Paulie Bleeker? I didn't know he had it in him! 
BREN (giggling) He just doesn't look, well, virile. 
LEAH I know, right? 
MAC Okay, this is no laughing matter. 
JUNO (indignant) No, it's not. Paulie is virile, by the way. He was very good in... chair. 
Leah fires a be quiet glance at Juno. 
MAC Did you say you were thinking about adoption? 
JUNO Yeah, well, there's this couple who've been trying to have a baby for five years. 
LEAH We found them in the Penny Saver by the exotic birds section. 
Bren looks understandably alarmed. Juno hastily attempts to make the situation sound more legitimate. 
JUNO But they have a real lawyer and everything. I'm going to meet with them next weekend. 
BREN Junebug, that is a tough, tough thing to do. Probably tougher than you can understand right now. 
JUNO Well, I'm not ready to be a mom. 
MAC Damn skippy, you're not! You don't even remember to give Liberty Bell her breathing meds. 
JUNO Once! And she didn't die, if you recall! 
BREN Honey, had you considered, you know, the alternative? 
Leah and Juno exchange glances. 
JUNO No. 
BREN Well, you're a brave young lady. You're made of stronger stuff than I thought. You're a little Viking! 
JUNO Cool it. 
BREN First things first, we have to get you healthy. You need prenatal vitamins. Incidentally, they'll do incredible things for your nails, so that's a plus. Oh, and we need to schedule a doctor's appointment. Find out where you're going to deliver. 
JUNO The term "deliver" is so weird. Can we not say "deliver"? 
LEAH How does "crap it out" sound? 
MAC Juno, I want to come with you to meet these adoption people. You're just a kid. I don't want you to get ripped off by a couple of babystarved wingnuts. 
JUNO Sure, Dad. 
Mac nods, satisfied, then contemplates the situation dismally. 
MAC I thought you were the kind of girl who knew when to say when. 
He glances sheepishly at Vanessa upon hearing the Penny Saver mention, then extends his hand to Mac and Juno. 
MARK Hi. I'm Mark Loring. I'm the husband. 
INT. LORING HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Mark and Vanessa usher Juno and Mac into the austere, spacious living room. A woman in a business suit sits on the couch with a briefcase in her lap. 
MARK This is our attorney, Gerta Rauss. 
JUNO (in exaggerated, growling German accent) Geeeerta Rauuuss! 
GERTA (straight) Nice to meet you. 
Mac seizes Mark's hand and pumps it heartily. 
MAC I'm Mac MacGuff, and this, of course, is my daughter Juno. 
MARK Like the city in Alaska? 
JUNO No. 
MARK Cool. Well, let's sit down and get to know each other a bit. 
VANESSA I'll get drinks. What would everyone like? I've got Pellegrino, Vitamin Water... 
JUNO A Maker's Mark, please. Up. 
MAC She's joking. Junebug has a wonderful sense of humor, which is just one of her many genetic gifts. 
JUNO I also have good teeth. No cavities. We finally got fluoridated water in Dancing Elk. 
She bares them frighteningly to demonstrate. 
Vanessa stares, unflappable. 
MAC We're fine, thank you. 
Mac and Juno join Mark and Gerta Rauss on the couch. 
GERTA So, Juno. First off, how far along are you? 
JUNO I'm a junior. 
GERTA No, I mean in your pregnancy. 
JUNO Oh. Uh, my stepmom took me to the doctor yesterday and they said I was twelve weeks. 
Vanessa enters with the refreshments on a tray. 
VANESSA Oh, that's marvelous. So you're almost into your second trimester, then? 
JUNO Yeah, apparently. I'm having it on May 4. 
VANESSA The tough part's almost over for you. I mean, my girlfriends always tell me the first couple months are the hardest. 
JUNO Yeah, but I hardly noticed it. I'm more worried about the part where I have to start wearing jeans with an elastic panel in the front. 
VANESSA I think pregnancy is beautiful. 
JUNO Well, you're lucky it's not you. 
Vanessa's looks to the ceiling. 
MARK (clearing throat) So, let's discuss how we're gonna do this... thing. 
JUNO Well, I just have the baby and give it to you, right? 
Juno opens the bathroom door and instantly BUMPS into Mark. 
JUNO Whoops! Yikes, I didn't expect to see you up here. 
MARK Sorry. I was just getting something. 
JUNO Did your wife send you up here to spy on me? 
MARK What? No! Do we come off like paranoid yuppies or something? 
JUNO Well, you don't just invite a random pregnant teenager into your house and leave her unsupervised. I could be a total klepto, for all you know. 
MARK I don't get a klepto vibe from you. Evil genius? Maybe. Arsonist? Wouldn't rule it out. 
JUNO I did steal a squirt of perfume. What do you think? It's Clinique Happy. 
She holds her WRIST up to Mark's twitching nostrils. 
JUNO Smell those sparkling topnotes! 
Mark inhales. 
MARK Am I supposed to feel happy now? 
JUNO You should be happy, Holmes. I'm giving you and Vanessa the gift of life. Sweet, screaming, pooping life! And you don't even have to be there when the baby comes out of me all covered in... 
MARK Viscera? 
JUNO Blood and guts. 
MARK We'd better get back downstairs ASAP. 
Juno mocks his use of "ASAP" silently. 
JUNO (halting) Wait a minute. Is that a Les Paul? 
Juno is staring into a room with the door slightly ajar. We see GUITARS mounted on the wall, and the edges of posters. 
MARK Oh. That's, uh, my room. Vanessa lets me have a room for all my old stuff. 
JUNO Wow, you get a whole room in your own house? She's got you on a long leash there, Mark. 
MARK Shut up. 
INT. LORING HOUSE - MARK'S "SPECIAL" ROOM - DAY 
The walls are plastered with FRAMED POSTERS of early-90s alt rock bands. (Mudhoney, Jane's Addiction etc.) Mark removes his LES PAUL from its moorings and hands it to Juno. 
JUNO It's beautiful. I've always liked Gibson better than Fender. 
MARK What do you play? 
JUNO I rock a Harmony. 
MARK (holding back a chuckle) Oh. 
JUNO What? I'm a pawn shop rocker. 
MARK Sorry. I swear I'm not a gear snob. 
Juno turns the guitar over, examining it closely. 
JUNO What is that, Mahogany? What happens if you crack the neck? 
MARK Tell me about it. I used to play in a really tight band back when I lived in Chicago, and one night we opened for the Melvins... do you know who the Melvins are? 
JUNO (lying) Yeah. 
INT. LORING HOUSE - ENTRY - DAY 
Juno and Mac have put their coats on and are in the process of leaving. Gerta hands Juno the DOCUMENTS. Vanessa and Mark trail behind. 
GERTA So, look those over and give me a call at my office if you have any questions. 
VANESSA Juno, we'd really appreciate it if you could keep us updated on any doctor's appointments, ultrasounds, other things of that nature. 
JUNO Oh. Sure. Of course you'd want to know how your kid is cooking. 
VANESSA So, then, you really think you're going to go ahead with this? 
Mac STARES at Juno gravely. 
JUNO Yeah. For sure. I like you guys. 
Juno looks at Mark. 
VANESSA How sure? Percentage-wise, would you say you're 80% sure, 90% sure? 
Mark seems visibly embarrassed by Vanessa's manic demeanor. 
JUNO I'm going to say I'm 104% sure. 
VANESSA Oh really? 
JUNO Look, if I could give it to you now, I would. But it probably looks like a Sea Monkey at this point, so I think we should leave it in there for a while until it gets cuter, you know? 
MAC I think that's a great idea. 
MARK That's great, right? Stellar news. Well, you guys drive safe, and we'll hear from you soon, all right? 
MAC All right, take care of yourselves. 
Juno and Mac exit. Mark shuts the door. All is silent in the foyer. Mark, Vanessa and Gerta stand motionless. Gerta pumps her fist triumphantly, trying to create a mood of celebration. 
GERTA (overly aggressive) All RIGHT! 
Vanessa buries her head in her hands and weeps hoarsely. 
EXT. SUBURBAN STREETS - MORNING 
It is now WINTER. The TRACK TEAM jogs in formation, leaving tracks in the snow. Those bastards never stop running. 
EXT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - TRACK - DAY 
Bleeker is running alone on the track. His exhalations are icy puffs in the air. Bleeker's friend VIJAY jogs up alongside him. Vijay is a solemn, skinny boy, much like Bleeker. 
VIJAY Hey man. 
BLEEKER Oh, hey Vijay. 
VIJAY Did you hear Juno MacGuff is pregnant? 
BLEEKER Yup. 
VIJAY Just like our moms and teachers! 
BLEEKER Yup. 
VIJAY Did you hear it's yours? 
BLEEKER Yup. 
VIJAY What a trip, man. 
BLEEKER I don't really know anything about it. 
ULTRASOUND TECH Oh. Well, thank goodness for that. 
BREN Wait, what's that supposed to mean? 
ULTRASOUND TECH I just see a lot of teenage mothers come through here. It's obviously a poisonous environment for a baby to be raised in. 
Juno, Leah and Bren become immediately defensive. 
JUNO How do you know I'm so poisonous? Like, what if the adoptive parents turn out to be evil molesters? 
LEAH Or stage parents! 
BREN They could be utterly negligent. Maybe they'll do a far shittier job of raising a kid than my dumbass stepdaughter ever would. Have you considered that? 
ULTRASOUND TECH No... I guess not. 
BREN What is your job title, exactly? 
ULTRASOUND TECH Excuse me? 
BREN I said, what-is-your-job-title, Missy? 
ULTRASOUND TECH I'm an ultrasound technician, ma'am. 
BREN Well I'm a nail technician, and I think we both ought to stick to what we know. 
ULTRASOUND TECH What are you talking about? 
BREN You think you're special because you get to play Picture Pages up there? 
Bren gestures to the ULTRASOUND MONITOR. 
BREN My five year-old daughter could do that, and let me tell you, she is not the brightest bulb in the tanning bed. So why don't you go back to night school in Manteno and learn a real trade! 
The ULTRASOUND TECH exits in a huff. 
JUNO Bren, you're a dick! I love it. 
INT. JUNO'S BEDROOM - DAY 
Juno lays in bed checking out the ULTRASOUND PRINT OUT. 
EXT. LORING NEIGHBORHOOD - PREVIA - AFTERNOON 
The Previa drives into the front gate of Mark and Vanessa's exclusive community. A sign on the gate reads "Glacial Valley." 
EXT. LORING HOUSE - ENTRY - AFTERNOON 
Juno rings the doorbell, shifting her weight in the cold. 
MARK answers the door, dressed in a t-shirt and jeans. 
MARK Juno? Wow, I didn't expect to see you here. 
JUNO I've got something really cool to show you guys. Is Vanessa here? 
MARK No, she's working late tonight. She's trying to accrue some extra time off for when, you know... 
He gestures awkwardly to Juno's belly. 
JUNO Right. I hear they can be kind of a time-suck. 
MARK Come on in. You wanna Ginseng Cooler? 
JUNO Sure. What is it with you rich people and your herb-infused juices? 
MARK I don't know. Something to do with the four-packs... (adding) ...They're not bad. 
MARK We definitely want it to have junk. 
JUNO Well don't worry about it. My stepmom is forcing me to eat really healthy. She won't even let me stand in front of the microwave or eat red M&Ms. Hope you're ready. 
Mark chuckles. 
MARK Wait...do you hear that? 
A new SONG has begun. Mark closes his eyes in ecstasy and walks toward the stereo. Juno follows him toward the source of the music, looking perplexed by how happy he is. 
JUNO What is it? 
MARK It's only my favorite song. It's Sonic Youth doing "Superstar" by the Carpenters. 
JUNO (excited) I've heard the Carpenters before. Chick drummer and freaky dude. Not unlike the White Stripes. 
MARK You haven't heard the Carpenters like this. Listen. 
Mark grabs the STEREO REMOTE off the kitchen counter and turns up the volume to a roar. Mark and Juno stand in silence in the kitchen. Mark mouths along with the lyrics. 
MARK (lipsynching) Don't you remember you told me you loved me, baby... 
JUNO Hey, I like this. 
MARK This album is all Carpenters covers by alt-rock bands. It's called If I Were a Carpenter. It is God. I'll rip a copy for you before you leave. 
JUNO You don't have to do that. 
MARK It's the least I can do. What did you say your favorite band was? 
JUNO I didn't. But it's a three-way tie between the Stooges, Patti Smith and the Runaways. 
MARK Yeah, I definitely need to make you some CDs. At least while my kid is hanging out in there. 
He gestures at Juno's burgeoning paunch. 
Mark walks over to his music collections and starts pulling CD's. He's got a Carpenter's disc, the "No Alternative" charity compilation, and Mother Love Bone. 
Juno spots a VHS TAPE on the coffee table and picks it up. 
JUNO (reading title) The Wizard of Gore? 
MARK (distracted) Oh yeah. It's Herschel Gordon Lewis. He's the ultimate master of horror. 
JUNO Please. Dario Argento is the ultimate master of horror. 
Mark SWIVELS AROUND slowly on his desk chair, surprised. 
MARK Argento's good, but Lewis is completely demented. We're talking buckets of goo. Red corn syrup everywhere. And fake brains up the yin-yang. 
JUNO (examining the tape box) Frankly, this looks kind of stupid. 
Mark gives a look - "Oh, Really?" 
INT. LORING HOUSE - DEN - AFTERNOON 
We see some particularly memorable footage from The Wizard of Gore. 
Mark and Juno are watching the movie and drinking root beer floats. They're sitting dangerously close on the sofa. 
JUNO (watching movie) This is even better than Suspiria. You've got decent taste in slasher movies, Mark. 
MARK Here's to dovetailing interests. 
He raises his mug in a toast and Juno clinks it awkwardly. 
JUNO So, have you and Vanessa thought of a name for the baby yet? 
VANESSA Yeah. Yeah, it kind of does. 
MARK Juno was nice enough to bring this by for us. 
JUNO I came over as soon as I got that cold ultrasound goo off my pelvis. My stepmom verbally abused the ultrasound tech so we were escorted off the premises. 
VANESSA (distracted) Oh, that's great! 
She can't divert her gaze from the photo. 
JUNO See? Nothing to worry about. 
Vanessa chuckles tightly, clearly embarrassed by her show of emotion. 
INT. LORING HOUSE - ENTRY WAY - DAY 
Vanessa and Mark walk Juno out. Juno peers at some shopping bags from various kids stores. 
JUNO Hey, what kind of swag did you score? 
MARK Yeah. Mall madness, huh? 
VANESSA Oh it's just some stuff I picked up. For, you know, the baby. Babies need a lot of things. I want everything to be just right. 
JUNO I thought people got all that stuff at baby showers. When my stepmom had my sister I remember she got about a million presents. They were all lame though, so I wasn't jealous. 
MARK I doubt anyone's throwing us a shower. 
JUNO Why? 
VANESSA Um, I think people are kind of unsure about the situation because it's not, you know, set in stone. 
JUNO What do you mean? You mean... (aghast) Do you think I'm going to flake out on you? 
VANESSA No, no, I don't think that, Juno. It's just that, we went through a situation before where it didn't work out. 
Juno glances at Mark and again at Vanessa. Vanessa looks embarrassed. 
MARK Cold feet. 
JUNO You should have gone to China. I heard they give away babies like free iPods. They shoot 'em out of those T-shirt guns at sports events. 
VANESSA (abruptly) Right. Well, Juno, your parents must be wondering where you are. You might want to head home. 
JUNO Naah. I'm already pregnant, so they figure nothing worse could happen to me. I gotta bounce anyway. It was nice seeing you guys again. 
She waves and heads for the door. 
MARK (to Juno) Hey, don't forget your bag. 
Vanessa looks pain-stricken as Mark helps Juno with her bag. 
EXT. MACGUFF HOUSE - NIGHT 
Juno kicks the snow off her shoes before she enters. 
INT. MACGUFF HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT 
Bren sits at the kitchen table with a mug of coffee and an issue of Dog Fancy. 
Juno enters nonchalantly, drinking a giant slushie. 
BREN Where the hell have you been, Junebug? 
JUNO I drove to St. Cloud to show Mark and Vanessa the ultrasound. And I wound up staying for a couple of hours. 
BREN A couple of hours? Why are you going up there in the first place? 
WOMAN #1 And I was like, "No offense, sweetie, but nobody looks good in gauchos." 
WOMAN #2 Especially not with her build. 
JUNO (mimicking the women, Peanuts-style) Wah-wah-waaah! 
One of the little girls in the group tugs at Vanessa's sleeve. Vanessa happily follows the little girl over to their play area and begins to play energetically with her. 
Juno watches intently, but Leah just snickers. 
LEAH She's gonna steal that kid for her collection. 
JUNO Right, seriously. 
They watch Vanessa for a few more moments. The other kids wander over toward the play area while their mothers ignore them. Vanessa continues to entertain the children. 
LEAH Bo-ring! 
Leah stands up. Juno lingers for a moment. 
INT. RIDGEDALE MALL - ELEVATOR BANK - A HALF HOUR LATER 
Leah and Juno approach the elevator. 
JUNO I want a huge cookie. And like, a lamb kebob. Simultaneously. 
LEAH God, Spermy. Must you always feed? 
The elevator door opens, revealing... Vanessa. 
VANESSA Juno? 
Juno tries her best to look enthused. 
JUNO Well hi Vanessa! What brings you to the mall today? 
VANESSA Just, you know, shopping with my girlfriends. 
LEAH You're gay? 
Juno glares at Leah. 
VANESSA (confused) No... 
JUNO Please excuse Leah. She's mentally challenged. 
VANESSA Oh, okay. So... how are you feeling? 
JUNO Happy? Oh, you mean like, physically. I'm good. Look, I have a snooze button now! 
She lifts her shirt and presses her popped-out NAVEL. 
VANESSA That's great. 
Vanessa is admiring the belly, when Juno grimaces. 
JUNO Dude, it's moshing all over. 
Vanessa looks confused. 
JUNO (explains) It's kicking. 
Vanessa nods in understanding then begins summoning the courage for an unusual request. 
VANESSA Um... Juno, can I -- Can I touch it? 
JUNO Are you kidding? Everyone at school is always grabbing at my belly. I'm like a legend. They call me the Cautionary Whale. 
JUNO Well, when you're used to the raw power of Iggy and the Stooges, everything else sounds kind of precious by comparison. 
MARK I imagine you have a collection of punk chestnuts to prove your point. 
JUNO Consider it your musical education. 
MARK I'm dying to see what you've got to teach me. 
JUNO Okay, stop surfing porn and get back to work. Just wanted to say hi. 
MARK Go learn something. 
Mark hangs up. Smiles. 
INT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - DAY 
CU on Juno's tray sliding along, picking up an odd combo of pregnant food. 
Pull up to find Juno and Leah walking their trays to a table. 
LEAH God, you're getting huge. How many months has it been now? 
JUNO Almost eight. You wouldn't believe how weird I look naked. 
LEAH I wish my funbags would get bigger. 
JUNO Trust me, you don't. I actually have to wear a bra now. And I have to rub this nasty cocoa butter stuff all over myself or my skin could get stretched too far and explode. 
LEAH Hot! 
INT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - DAY 
Juno and Leah are sitting inside an emptied awards case on the wall, eating their lunch. 
Juno notices that the other kids in the cafeteria can't help but glance her way. Some look derisive, others are amused. 
JUNO God, why is everyone always staring at me? 
LEAH Well, you are kind of... convex. 
She illustrates by making a rounded gesture near her stomach. 
JUNO Wow, someone's been actually doing her geometry homework for once! 
LEAH I don't have a choice. Keith's been grading me really hard lately. 
JUNO Please do not refer to Mr. Conyers as "Keith," okay? My barf reflex is already heightened these days. 
LEAH Keith's hot. 
JUNO Eww, he's all beardy! 
We see KEITH the teacher talking to some science kids in the background. He has a Wild America beard. He lifts a cup of coffee to his lips and slurps lustily. 
BACK ON JUNO AND LEAH: 
LEAH Did you hear Bleek is going to prom with Katrina De Voort? 
JUNO Katrina? Pfft, no way. He doesn't like Katrina. It must be a pity date. 
LEAH (shrugging) He asked her. I heard they were going to Benihana, then the prom, then to Vijay's parents' cabin. 
JUNO Bleeker told me Katrina's whole house reeks of soup! 
LEAH Oh, it totally does. I was there for her birthday about four years ago and it was like Lipton Landing. But you know, boys have endured worse things for nookie. 
JUNO There's no way in hell they're having sex or even holding hands. 
JUNO Well at least you don't have to walk around with the evidence under your sweater. I'm a planet! 
Juno picks up her BACKPACK dejectedly and slides it over her shoulder. She's about to walk away, when... 
BLEEKER Wait, let me take that. 
JUNO Huh? 
BLEEKER You shouldn't be carrying that heavy bag. I'll take it. 
JUNO Oh. It's fine. What's another ten pounds? 
She turns around, wipes TEARS off her cheek (making sure no one sees) and continues down the hallway. 
EXT. MACGUFF HOUSE - PREVIA - DAY 
Juno climbs ungracefully into the van. She starts the engine, then pauses to dig through her backpack for something. She produces a brush and begins brushing her hair in the rearview mirror, examining herself self-consciously. She puts on some Dr. Pepper Lip Smacker and backs out of the driveway. 
INT. LORING HOUSE - MARK'S SPECIAL ROOM - DAY 
Mark is seated at the computer, surfing a horror movie website. He has the blank expression of a bored obsessive. The doorbell rings. 
INT. LORING HOUSE - ENTRY - DAY 
Mark opens the door. Juno stands there, looking radiantly knocked-up. She holds a stack of CDs. Mark breaks into a grin. 
MARK Wow. That shirt is working hard. 
JUNO (furtive) Is Vanessa here? 
MARK Nope. We're safe. 
He and Juno smile conspiratorially. 
JUNO Cool. 
MARK Come on, I have something for you. 
He gestures for Juno to follow him into the house. 
INT. LORING HOUSE - BASEMENT - AFTERNOON 
The Lorings' basement is dank, cluttered unfinished and unattractive, much like Paulie Bleeker's. Mark pulls a chain to illuminate a bare bulb. 
JUNO Oh, Mark! Is this the baby's room? It's beautiful! 
MARK Hilarious. No, I just keep all of my old comics down here, and I want to show you one of them. 
JUNO Oh God, you're one of those guys... 
MARK You're gonna like this, I promise. 
Mark RUMMAGES through a cardboard box in the corner. 
MARK (extracting a bagged COMIC from the box) Here it is. 
He shows the COMIC to Juno. It's called "Most Fruitful Yuki." It depicts a pregnant JAPANESE GIRL kicking ass and taking names. 
JUNO "Most Fruitful Yuki"? What is... Oh my god, she's a pregnant superhero! 
MARK Isn't that great? I got it when I was in Japan with my band. She reminds me of you. 
Juno examines the comic. "Most Fruitful Yuki" does resemble her. 
JUNO Wow, I actually feel like less of a fat dork now. 
MARK Most Fruitful Yuki is bad ass, man. You should be proud to be the same condition. 
After a beat, she begins to gather herself. 
INT. BLEEKER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Bleeker is sitting next to his bed, noodling on the guitar. He's playing a theme that we will soon recognise. 
EXT. CORNER STORE - NIGHT 
Juno lays on the hood of her Previa, contemplating her future. We push in close... when she gets an idea. 
She hops off the hood and scurries into the Previa where she finds a crumpled up Jiffy Lube receipt. She unfolds it and pulls out a pen, ready to write something... a note? 
EXT. LORING HOUSE - NIGHT 
It's quiet after the storm. Inside, we see Vanessa sitting alone at her perfect dining room table, drinking a glass of wine. 
INT. LORING HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT 
Vanessa takes a sip and continues to let the days events sink in. After a beat, Mark comes down the stairs to join her. 
MARK I called Gerta Rauss. She says she can represent both of us. They call it "collaborative divorce." It's apparently all the rage right now. And it's easy because we don't have children. 
VANESSA No, it's fine. Thanks for making the call, I guess. 
Mark nods and sits down. 
VANESSA We're actually, finally doing this? 
MARK Looks like it, yeah. 
VANESSA Have you found a place to stay? 
MARK Yeah, downtown. 
VANESSA A hotel? 
MARK It's a loft. 
VANESSA (lightly teasing) Aren't you the cool guy? 
They STARE at the wall, speechless and defeated. 
VANESSA I wanted a baby so bad. So bad. 
She buries her head in her hands. 
MARK I know you did. 
There's a LOUD KNOCK on the front door. 
EXT. LORING HOUSE - ENTRY - NIGHT 
Mark opens the door. There's a folded piece of paper sitting on the doormat. He squints and sees Juno pulling away in the van. 
Mark carefully unfolds the piece of paper -- it takes a minute because of Juno's proficiency in "teen girl origami." He holds it up. We can see there's WRITING on the back. 
MARK It looks like a bill from Jiffy-Lube. 
Vanessa takes the note from his hand and turns it over, examining it. 
VANESSA It's for me. 
EXT. MACGUFF HOUSE - NIGHT 
Juno parks her car and walks up to her house. A porch light's been left on for her, and the place looks cozy and inviting. 
JUNO (V.O.) I never realize how much I like being home unless I've been somewhere really different for a while. 
MONTAGE: 
INT. BLEEKER HOUSE - BLEEKER'S ROOM - NIGHT 
We push in over Bleeker sleeping in his car-bed towards the window. We look out onto the lawn to find Juno and Leah running back to the Previa, hopping in, and screeching off. 
EXT. BLEEKER HOUSE - MORNING 
Bleeker steps out of the house for his usual early-morning run. He looks down to see a message scrawled in chalk on the stoop: "BLEEKER -- CHECK THE MAIL." 
He walks down to the end of the driveway and opens the latch on the mailbox. 
At least one hundred containers of ORANGE TIC TACS come pouring out in an colorful deluge. They spill out onto the driveway. Bleeker smiles. 
EXT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - TRACK - MORNING 
Juno waddles toward the field. The guys on the track team, ridiculously arrayed as usual, are doing hurdler stretches. They stare at her quizzically. Bleeker spots Juno approaching and jogs up to the chainlink fence. 
BLEEKER Did you put like a hundred things of Tic Tacs in my mailbox? 
JUNO Yeah. That was me. 
BLEEKER Why? 
JUNO (blushes) Because they're your fave. And you can never have too much of your favorite one-calorie breath mint. 
BLEEKER Well... thanks. I think I'm pretty much set until college on the Tic Tac front. 
JUNO You know, I've been thinking. I'm really sorry I was such a huge bitch to you. You didn't deserve that. You never deserve any of the poo I unload on you. 
BLEEKER You know it's okay. 
JUNO Also, I think I'm in love with you. 
BLEEKER What, you mean as friends? 
JUNO No, for real. I think you are the coolest person I've ever met. And you don't even have to try. 
BLEEKER I try really hard, actually... 
JUNO No, you're naturally smart. You always think of the funniest things to do. Remember when you passed me that postcard during Spanish class, and it was addressed like, "Junebug MacGuff, Row 4, Third Seat From the Blackboard"? And it said, "I'm having fun in Barcelona -- wish you were here"? That was hilarious. 
BLEEKER I was just bored. I only think school is awesome like, 80% of the time. 
JUNO Plus, you're the only person who doesn't stare at my stomach all the fucking time. You actually look at my face. And every time I look at you, the baby starts kicking me super hard. 
BLEEKER It does? 
Juno presses Bleeker's hand against her belly. 
BLEEKER Wizard! 
JUNO I think it's because my heart starts pounding when I see you. 
BLEEKER Mine too. 
JUNO Basically, I'm completely smitten with you, and I don't care if I'm making an ass out of myself right now, because you've seen me make an ass out of myself a million times, and you still want to be my friend. 
BLEEKER Well, yeah. You're the best friend I've ever had, even when you're being kind of evil. 
JUNO That's all I need from you. That's more than I could ever ask for. You're just golden, dude. 
BLEEKER Can we make out now? 
JUNO Okay. 
Bleeker and Juno KISS, oblivious to the gawking track team guys in the background. 
JUNO (V.O.) There he was. 
Juno looks at the baby in awe, then her eyes begin to flutter... and she passes out. 
EXT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - TRACK - AFTERNOON 
Paulie Bleeker is running as fast as his legs can carry him on the Dancing Elk track. There's a very sparse crowd in the bleachers. As Paulie approaches the tape, his envious teammate Vijay looks on. Bleeker's mom is seated near Vijay, holding a video camera. 
JUNO (V.O.) I decided to not call Bleeker to tell him that I was having the baby. He had a big meet against Manteno and I didn't want him to get all worried about me and choke. 
Paulie breaks the tape, winning the race. The fifteen or so people in attendance cheer. 
VIJAY (admiringly) His legs are as swift as his seed. 
MRS. BLEEKER What did you say? 
Bleeker pants at the finish line, dripping with sweat. 
ANNOUNCER P. Bleeker has just broken a district record in the 400. 
Bleeker looks out at the BLEACHERS, scanning them for Juno. 
She's not there. 
JUNO (V.O.) But he figured it out anyway. 
Bleek takes off RUNNING toward the parking lot without stopping to explain. His mother stands up, confused. 
INT. HOSPITAL - MATERNITY WARD - DAY 
A NURSE reaches into one of the maternity ward bassinets and gently lifts up a swaddled newborn baby. 
The nurse turns and addresses an unseen spectator. 
NURSE Would you like to meet your son? 
Pull back to reveal she's speaking to VANESSA, who stands, paralyzed, several feet away. 
VANESSA I have a son? 
NURSE (amused) You are the adoptive mother? 
VANESSA I have a son. 
NURSE Healthy kid, too. Didn't waste any time getting out. 
Vanessa reaches out for the baby and gingerly accepts him in her eyes. She spends a few moments just looking at him. 
She feels someone watching her, then looks up to see a Bren leaning against the doorway. 
Vanessa blinks away her tears self-consciously. 
VANESSA How do I look? 
BREN (gently) Like a mom. Scared shitless. 
Vanessa laughs. 
INT. HOSPITAL - BIRTHING SUITE - DAY 
Juno is curled up on her bed in the birthing room. The birth is obviously over; there's that air of stillness and accomplishment, a task completed. The doctors have cleared out. Mac sits in a chair next to the bed, looking like he's not sure what to say. 
He holds up a deck of Playing cards as if to initiate a game, but Juno gently pushes his hand away. Their eyes meet. His expression is helpless, hers is utterly drained. 
MAC Someday, you'll be back here, honey. On your terms. 
Juno nods and swallows.

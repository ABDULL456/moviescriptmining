FADE IN: 
EXT THE WHITE HOUSE NIGHT 
A VAN FULL OF PEOPLE STOPS AT A SIDE ENTRANCE. 
ANGLE INT THE WHITE HOUSE 
AT THE SIDE, UTILITY ENTRANCE, WE SEE THE DISGORGING WORKING-CLASS MEN AND WOMEN, THEY PASS THROUGH SECURITY SCREENING IN THE B.G., THROUGH METAL DETECTORS, AND PAST SEVERAL GUARDS WHO CHECK THE PHOTO-I.D.'S AROUND THEIR NECKS. 
ANGLE INT THE WHITE HOUSE 
WILFRED AMES, AND AMY CAIN, A BRIGHT YOUNG WOMAN IN HER TWENTIES, WALKING DOWN A CORRIDOR, LOOKING WORRIED. 
ANGLE AMES AND CAIN AMES AND CAIN HAVE STOPPED AT THE END OF THE HALL.  BEYOND THEM WE SEE THE CLEANING PEOPLE COMING IN FROM THE VAN, AND BEING CLEARED THROUGH A METAL DETECTOR INTO A HOLDING AREA, AND HANDED CLEANING MATERIALS, MOPS, VACUUMS, ET CETERA, BY A TYPE HOLDING A CLIPBOARD.  PART OF THE GROUP, A MAN IN HIS FORTIES, IN A RATTY JACKET, OPEN COLLARED SHIRT, PASSES THROUGH THE GROUP, AND IS STOPPED BY A SECRET SERVICEMAN WHO APPEARS NEXT TO AMES.  IN THE B.G. WE SEE A TV IN AN ADJACENT ROOM, SHOWING A POLITICAL COMMERCIAL. 
AMES (TO SECRET SERVICEMAN) ...That's him. 
AMES MOVES OUT OF THE SHOT.  LEAVING US ON THE POLITICAL COMMERCIAL. 
WE SEE TWO BUSINESS PEOPLE ON THE PLANE, A MAN AND A WOMAN. 
BUSINESSMAN Well, all I know, you don't change horses in the middle of the stream. 
BUSINESSWOMAN "Don't change Horses," well, there's a lot of truth in that. 
THE IMAGE SHIFTS TO A PRESIDENT, DOING PRESIDENTIAL THINGS.  AND THE VOICE- OVER. 
VOICE-OVER For Peace, prosperity, for all of us:  Don't change Horses in... 
ANGLE 
A CORRIDOR OF THE WHITE HOUSE, AS AMES AND THE MAN IN THE RATTY JACKET (BREAN) WALK HURRIEDLY.  AMES FINISHES ONE CIGARETTE AND USES THE BUTT TO LIGHT A FRESH ONE.  THEY PASS BY A LARGE PHOTOGRAPH OF THE BACK OF A MAN, BENDING TO SHAKE HANDS WITH ONE OF A LINE OF GIRLSCOUTS.  AMES GLANCES UP AT THE PHOTOGRAPH AND SHAKES HIS HEAD DEJECTEDLY. 
INT WHITE  HOUSE "SITUATION" ROOM.   NIGHT. 
A WOMAN WITH A STENOPAD, ARRANGING PADS AND PENCILS AT A SMALL CONFERENCE TABLE.  A SECRET SERVICE TYPE PUTS HIS HEAD IN THE ROOM, AND BOWS OUT, AND NODS, BREAN AND AMES ENTER HURRIEDLY. 
AMES We're going to... 
HE STOPS TALKING AS A WHITE HOUSE WAITER ENTERS WITH A TRAY WITH COFFEE THINGS ON IT, FOLLOWED BY TWO YOUNG AIDES, SLEEPY AND DISHEVELLED, WHO ENTER QUICKLY, AND APOLOGIES UNUTTERED, SIT AND MAKE THEMSELVES SMALL. 
BREAN MAKES A LITTLE GESTURE AT THE WAITER, WHO IS SETTING OUT THE COFFEE, AND AT THE STENOGRAPHER, MEANING "GET THEM OUT OF HERE." 
AMES Thank you, that'll be all. 
THE STENOGRAPHER AND THE WAITER LEAVE 
BREAN (OF THE TWO STAFFERS) Who we got here...? 
AMES John Levy, Staff, and Amy Cain, Press Off.... 
BREAN Alright.  Look here, any of you kids hear in this room:  what you hear here, what you say here, what you do here, f'it got out, you leaked it. (TO AMES) Tell'em what they need to know. 
AMES When it broke, he said one word:  get me Ronnie Brean. 
BREAN (NODS) Well.  Alright.  What is it?  What's, he, uh...?  He had an Illegal Immigrant, was his Gardener, some years back...? (SMILES) What's the thing?  You people get ahead, you sure get nervous. 
AN AIDE ENTERS, WITH SEVERAL TYPED SHEETS, WHICH SHE HANDS TO CAIN. CAIN READS TO HERSELF, PASSES THEM TO AMES. 
BREAN (CON'T) ...he made a pass at some Secretary, back in... 
AIDE You want some research, flu?  Side-effects of medi.... 
BREAN Naw, we can't play this one catch-up.  That's how long since you stopped beating the wife.  We have to... 
AMES We're going to have to explain away the... 
BREAN They caught him in the closet with a Girlscout.  Side- effects of a pill ain't gone trump that.  You have to keep'em guessing for (HE GLANCES AT THE CALENDAR) Two weeks.  You  don't have to Cure Cancer, Pal, you just have to give them something more interesting than... 
CAIN What's more interesting than boffing the girlscout? 
BREAN Well, that's what we're doing here... 
BREAN IS SUNK IN THOUGHT.  AN AIDE STARTS TO SPEAK.  AMES SILENCES HIM, BREAN BECKONS AMES OVER. 
BREAN (SOTTO) Gemme twenty thousand dollars.... 
AMES NODS, AND WAVES AN AIDE OVER AND WHISPERS TO HER. 
BREAN (CONT.) And gemme a car. 
AMES Car and a driver, Mr. Brean, the Westgate, Now, please... 
BREAN Okay, look, who's takin' the press conference today? 
CAIN Is there a press conference today? 
BREAN What do you think?  What I need from you:  I need a base of operations.  Some place in the District.  I need some clean money ... 
LEVY How much...? 
AMES GESTURES HIM TO BE QUIET. 
BREAN And, to hold it together, I need two days.  There is no B-2 Bomber:  here's what you do ahout that:  whoever is leaking stuff to that geek at the Post, lets it slip, "Geez, I hope this doesn't screw up the B-2 Program..." "What B-2 Program, and why should it screw it up?"  "If the president moves to deploy the B-2 before it is fully tested."  "Deploy the B-2, Why?"  "In the Crisis." 
AMES What crisis? 
BREAN I'm working on it.  Same time, you call Billy Scott at Joint Chiefs, and pour him onna plane right now to Seattle, y'got that...?  All flustered and worried. To talk to the Boeing people. 
AMES (TO LEVY) Do it... 
LEVY MOVES TO A TELEPHONE. 
BREAN (TO CAIN) And you? 
CAIN But there isn't a B-2 bomber. 
BREAN Where'd you go to school, Kid.  Wellesly? 
CAIN Dartmouth 
BREAN Then show a little spunk.  There Is no B-2 Bomber, General Scott, the best of your knowledge, is not in Seattle to talk with Boeing... 
AMES It won't hold. 
BREAN One day, Two days?  Course it's gonna hhhh.... 
CAMERA TAKES THEM DOWN THE HALL, WHERE WE SEE THE CLEANING PEOPLE, WITH FLOOR POLISHERS, LOOKING UP AT THE PICTURE OF THE PRESIDENT AND THE GIRLSCOUTS, AND SNICKERING. 
ANGLE ON BREAN AND AMES LOOKING ON. THE CLEANING PEOPLE NOTICE THEY ARE BEING WATCHED AND DISPERSE. 
AMES It won't hold, Ronnie, it won't prove out. 
BREAN We don't need it to prove out.  We need it to distract them for two weeks til the election. 
AMES What would do that...? 
HOLD, ON BREAN THINKING. 
AMES (CONT.) What in the world would do that? 
BREAN I'm working on it. 
HE TURNS AROUND AND STARES AT THE WALL. 
BREAN WALKS TO THE COUNTER WHERE THE COFFEE AND ROLLS ARE STEAMING.  ON THE WALL ARE HUNG TWO WIPE-OFF SLATES.  ONE READS "DAYS TO ELECTION 12," THE OTHER READS "% IN FAVOR 63" BREAN PICKS UP A ROLL, DOWNS A COFFEE, AND STARTS OUT OF THE DOOR. 
ANGLE CAMERA TAKES THEM OUT INTO THE HALL. BREAN LEANS CLOSE TO AMES. 
BREAN Gimme twenty thousand dollars. 
HE STARTS INTO THE HALL, FOLLOWED BY THE ENTOURAGE, AND THE CAMERA. 
BREAN I'll be back within the hour.  Now, 
AMES (WALKS ALONG, SHAKING HIS HEAD) It's going to be fine.  It's going to be ... you remember in 88, when... 
HE ROLLS OVER AGAIN. 
AMES (AS IF REHEARSING IT TO HIMSELF) ...you want us to go to War... 
BREAN ROUSES HIMSELF, SHRUGS, TAKES OUT A NOTEBOOK, AND BEGINS TO WRITE. 
BREAN ...that's the general idea. 
AMES Why? 
BREAN Why not, what've they ever done for us...?  Also:  they sound... Ah, you see, this is why we have to mobilize the B-2 Bomber... 
AMES ...they sound what? 
BREAN Shifty.  Who knows anything about em... 
AMES Hold on, hold on, hold on: 
BREAN Well, I'm gonna hold on, but you went to win this election, you better change the subject.  You wanna change this subject, you better have a War.  What do you need?  It's gotta be quick, it's gotta be dramatic, you got to have an enemy.  Okay?  What do you need in an enemy?  Somebody you fear.  Who do you fear? Som'b'y you don't know. 
AMES Who? 
BREAN Well, I'm working on it.... 
HE ROLLS OVER.

AMES Albania... 
BREAN Yes. 
AMES Why? 
BREAN What do you know about them? 
AMES ...nothing... 
BREAN Precisely. 
AMES What did Albania ever do to us? 
BREAN What did they ever do for us...? (PAUSE) You see, this is why we have to mobilize the B-2 Bomber. 
AMES (TO HIMSELF) ...you want us to go to War with Albania. 
BREAN Here's what you got to do: (HE GESTURES, "GET ON THE PHONE") Get your Press Office, Right now.  To deny;  There is no report of Albanian Activity.  They have to deny it. Now, get the C.I.A.

THE BUSINESS TYPES BEGIN TO QUEUE UP IN A SLEEPY LINE.  BREAN LEANS CLOSER TO THE TELEVISION, AS IT CHANGES TO A NEWS LOGO, AND A TALKING HEAD APPEARS. 
TALKING HEAD Good morning:  With the election eleven days away the world slept, expecting news from the President on Trade and his visit to China, another sort of news, however, has emerged from the Presidential Quarter.  Chris Andrews, station KCRT, Santa Fe Reports: 
BREAN LEANS BACK FROM THE TELEVISION, AND PUTS HIS ATTENTION ON THE BUSINESS PEOPLE ABOUT TO FILE ONTO THE PLANE.  AS HE WATCHES THEY MOVE FIRST ONE AT A TIME, AND THEN, IN A GROUP, DRAWN TO THE TELEVISIONS. 
ANGLE: BREAN, LOOKING AT THE BUSINESS PEOPLE, CLUSTERING UP.  BEYOND HIM, WE SEE THE TALKING HEAD FROM SANTA FE, THE SHOT OF THE PRESIDENT WITH THE GIRLSCOUTS, WHICH WE SAW PREVIOUSLY ON THE WHITE HOUSE WALL, AND ON THE CAMPAIGN BUTTONS. 
BREAN TAKES OUT A NOTEPAD AND STARTS MAKING NOTES.  AMES WANDERS INTO THE SHOT, WITH A CUP OF DUNKIN' DONUTS COFFEE, AND THE CELLPHONE INTO WHICH HE IS TALKING.

THE TWO ARE IN THE QUEUE THROUGH THE JETWAY.  THEY COME TO THE DOOR OF THE AIRLINER.

MOSS STARTS STRIPPING OFF HIS CLOTHES, AND CHANGING INTO A SWIMSUIT. 
MOSS You wouldn't be here if it wasn't true.  It's true, right? 
HE SWITCHES ON THE TELEVISION IN THE CABANA.  WE SEE A FEMALE TALKING HEAD.

Look here, here's an idea... Here's an idea... (HE WALKS OVER TO THE DOOR.) Turn it on it's head.  If we're ahead in the polls, well, hell, this is the time to capitalize on it.  What do you think?

MR. YOUNG I have. 
BREAN Well, I have, too.  Would you do it again...?  In't that why you're here?  I guess so.  N'if you go to war again, who is it going to be against?  Your "ability to fight a Two-ocean War" against who?  Sweden and Togo? Who you sitting here to Go To War Against?  That time has passed.  It's passed.  It's over.  The War of the Future is Nuclear Terrorism.  It is and it will be against a Small Group of Dissidents who, unbeknownst, perhaps, to their own governments, have blah blah blah. And to go to that war, you've got to be prepared.  You have to be alert, and the public has to be alert. Cause that is the war of the future, and if you're not gearing up, to fight that war, eventually the axe will fall.  N'you're gonna be out in the street. (PAUSE) And you can call this a "drill," or you can call it "job security," or you can call it anything you like. But I got one for you:  you said, "Go to War to protect your Way of Life,"  well, Chuck, this (HE GESTURES AROUND THE ROOM) is your way of life.  Innit?  And if there ain't no war, you can punch out, go home, and take up Oil Painting.  And there ain't no war but ours. (PAUSE)

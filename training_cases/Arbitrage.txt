ARBITRAGE

BLACK. 
Over CREDITS we HEAR: 
MARIA (O.S.) ...but you took a huge bet on the housing crisis in the middle of the biggest boom anybody'd ever seen. Why? 
ROBERT (O.S.) I'm a child of the 50's. My father welded steel for the Navy. And my mother worked at the VA. 
INT. ROBERT'S MANSION - DAY 
As the conversation continues we see: 
1. A MAID clean an expansive living room, waxing a mahogany table. 
2. A BUTLER open sliding doors to an empty grand sitting room. 
3. An overhead shot as a SERVANT carries packages up a long winding staircase. 
ROBERT They lived through the Depression, Pearl Harbor, and the Bomb. And they didn't think bad things might happen; they knew they would happen. 
MARIA Is that what's happening now? 
ROBERT When I was a kid my favorite teacher was Mr. James. Mr. James said that world events always revolve around five things: (extending his fingers one- BY-ONE) 
INT. ROBERT'S LIVING ROOM - DAY 
And right on cue, we see for the first time -- ROBERT MILLER (60) -- sitting on a sofa across from MARIA BARTIROMO and a CAMERA CREW, mid-interview. ELLEN MILLER (58) watches on a nearby MONITOR. 
ROBERT M-O-N-E-Y. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 2. 
MARIA (LAUGHING) Was this freshman econ? 
ROBERT This was fifth-grade econ. (smiles, off her laugh) But this is something we've seen over and over again, time and time again, that competition for this-- limited amount of dollars out there, can make even the best of us manic. So it's not surprising that we see these asset bubbles, but when reality sets in of course, they burst. 
CUT TO BLACK. 
"ARBITRAGE" 
CLOUDS GIVE WAY TO A: 
FALCON 900EX - SOARING THROUGH THE SKIES AT 550MPH 
And we push tighter into the plane, cutting into the engine, as we hear a sonic boom and focus inside, revealing... 
INT. FALCON 
A sleek, slate-gray cabin, divided into three seating areas. 
At the back of the plane, five AIDES DE CAMP chatter in hushed tones, pouring over a sea of red-inked paper. 
In the galley, GAVIN BRIAR (42), pours a coffee. He brings it BACK TO 
ROBERT 
who sits alone in his private area facing the cockpit, scribbling his own red-ink across a stack of CONTRACT DOCUMENTS. His effortless slouch, silver hair, and all- commanding mannerisms make one thing clear: Robert's our man. 
GAVIN (handing him the coffee) Here you go... 
Robert sips it. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 3. 
GAVIN (CONT'D) (SITTING) You're disappointed. 
ROBERT Quants? Derivatives structures? What was that about? 
GAVIN It makes no sense. 
ROBERT That's what you said last week. Why'd we go down there? 
ROBERT (hugging her, happy) No, no that's okay. Where's my drink, is this mine, here? 
Another SERVANT enters with a CAKE flickering birthday candles. Everyone notices and starts CLAPPING. 
ALL HEY! HAPPY BIRTHDAY! YAY! 
Robert smiles. They finish cheering, then CLINK glasses for a toast. 
ROBERT Thank you, thank you, thank you all very much, it's such a surprise, I didn't even know it was my birthday! 
Everyone laughs a little. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 6. 
ROBERT (CONT'D) What did Mark Twain say about? He said-- old age... is clearly a case of mind over matter. If you don't mind, it doesn't matter. (MORE LAUGHTER) I've done a lot of things in my life, worked very hard, but being here, looking around-- at all these shining, radiant faces, I know that my best work is right here in this room, right now... I'm deeply proud of all of you. That's the best gift your mother and I could have hoped for, (KISSES ELLEN) so, thank you... 
PETER (CALLING OUT) ...and to have sold the company to Standard this morning! 
They all LAUGH. 
ROBERT (SMILES) That, too, Peter, but- no business tonight-- no business! 
ELLEN Oh, here we go! 
More group LAUGHTER. 
ROBERT Although your one-track mind assures me you've got not only your mother's genes, but you've got mine, too! 
More LAUGHTER. Robert laughs, too. He sees Ellen hug Peter across the room. 
ROBERT (CONT'D) Now, I'm aware that may seem uncharacteristic, but maybe it's taken me sixty years to realize what's truly important -- and it's you guys so thank you all very much. 
ALL (as they applaud) Hear, hear! Goldenrod - 4.17.11 7. 
INT. STUDY - MOMENTS LATER 
A warm, clubby room, kept traditional. Robert pours out two SCOTCHES. 
ROBERT Kids are wild. 
BROOKE (LAUGHING) I don't know about me as a mom. 
ROBERT No, no no, you should have-- I want more "you's" around. 
Robert brings the drinks to the banquette where Brooke rests with an open FOLDER. He resumes signing papers. 
BROOKE (LAUGHS) It's all about you, isn't it. (POINTS) Four... and nineteen. 
ROBERT Yeah, yeah yeah... 
Brooke nods, tries to smile. 
BROOKE So what was that all about? 
ROBERT What? 
BROOKE The last time you made a speech like that we lost the Firestone bid. 
ROBERT (LAUGHS) Yeah, well... I just... wanted it to be about the family tonight. 
She nods again, unconvinced, then pulls out a MAGAZINE. 
BROOKE You see this? 
He looks closely at it. A "Forbes" cover story: 
"Robert Miller, the Oracle of Gracie Square: Investor profits in uncertain times by predicting housing crisis." Goldenrod - 4.17.11 8. 
ROBERT (shakes his head) Yeah... Oy. You know how I feel about that. Trash can. 
BROOKE Peter's got a copy pinned up in the conference room. 
ROBERT (sits back, takes a drink) Well, you gonna keep skirting around it? 
Brooke leans back and stares at him. 
ROBERT (slight beat, then DEFINITIVE) I will be there. 
She stares, still in the moment. Then she heads to the fridge and slides out a homemade BIRTHDAY CAKE. He stares at it. 
ROBERT (CONT'D) (LAUGHING) Oh wow, that's great. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 11. 
JULIE I made this for you. 
ROBERT You made this? This is amazing. One candle, thank you very... 
She reaches for the cake, grabbing a piece of it with her hand and... SMEARS IT ONTO HIS FACE. 
The tension breaks, and they LAUGH. He grabs her and they kiss furiously, pulling at each other's clothes as she pushes him backwards into the bedroom and they begin to make love. 
INT. GREENBERG & COMPANY - OFFICE HALL - THE NEXT DAY 
Robert enters the palatial quarters, decorated with ornate 18th century furniture. As we'll see soon, it's a stark contrast to his functional empire. He follows a striking British RECEPTIONIST down a long hallway passing a massive glass conference room. They arrive at 
INT. GREENBERG'S OFFICE - SAME 
The receptionist escorts Robert in. Standing to greet him is JEFFREY GREENBERG (53), handsome and charming. 
JEFFREY Thank you, Diane. 
She exits. Robert sits. A moment of silence. 
JEFFREY (CONT'D) So? 
ROBERT I'm here. 
JEFFREY Guess what's not? 
ROBERT Jeffrey, I told you, I'm... 
JEFFREY "...working on it," yeah. Well, while you're doing that, lemme tell you what's not working... 
ROBERT (LEANING FORWARD) Jeffrey... Goldenrod - 4.17.11 12. 
JEFFREY (LOUDER) ...what's not working is my four hundred twelve million dollars that's sitting in your account so you can pass your audit, the four hundred twelve million that you needed, you said, for two weeks, and which has been languishing now for (looks down at paper) thirty-two days, while it could be elsewhere invested, earning an actual return, instead of couching the absurd lie that you're spinning. 
ROBERT What do you want me to say? 
JEFFREY That you're gonna get a signature from Mayfield, and that my hostage money and my fee are going to be sent to me promptly, say... by tomorrow? 
A beat. 
ROBERT I am solving the problem. I am getting you your money and your fee. You will have them very shortly. 
JEFFREY When? 
ROBERT As soon as they sign the contract. 
JEFFREY (BEAT) You know, I'm not the one with the liability, pal. I just made a loan. You're looking at jail for a thousand years for fraudulent conveyance and... 
ROBERT ...Stop it! You don't have to talk to me like that!... 
JEFFREY I didn't get you into this mess! 
ROBERT You were a friend of mine!... Goldenrod - 4.17.11 13. 
JEFFREY ...remember when you asked me if it was a good idea to divert half your liquid assets into a fucking copper mine? What did I tell you? 
ROBERT (stands, heading to door WITH COAT) Are we done here? I think we're done here. 
Jeffrey stares at him contemplatively for a moment, then appears to reach some sort of conclusion. 
JEFFREY (MATTER-OF-FACT) Friday morning I take my money back. 
ROBERT (SHAKES HEAD) You can't do that... 
JEFFREY ...the fuck I can't, it's in an escrow bill with one-day call rights... 
ROBERT ...I need the money there until they sign, Jeffrey. What if they check again? 
ROBERT I don't wanna be in the cemetery! 
ELLEN Oh, by the way, Mary called from St. Victor's Hospital, again, she said they still haven't gotten the check yet... 
ROBERT I'm taking care of it. 
ELLEN The gala is Friday. Should I be selling my ring? What's going on? 
ROBERT I've had to move some things around for the merger. 
ELLEN It's only two million. 
ROBERT (walks up to her, laughs) Only two million? 
ELLEN (SMILES) Yeah! 
ROBERT You remember-- Riccio's? Full meals... two bucks... all you can eat... three bucks... 
ELLEN I do remember. But I do not remember you being so sentimental unless you were trying to change the subject. 
A KNOCK at the door. 
ROBERT (as he heads out, smiling) I don't know what you're talking about... 
Ellen slaps his behind. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 17. 
INT. MAYBACH - NIGHT 
Robert and Gavin ride, both shuffling papers. 
INT. FOUR SEASONS RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS 
Robert trails Gavin up the stairs as he types out a TEXT MESSAGE to Julie: "Wrapping up mtg- be there soon." 
The MAITRE'D spots Robert and greets him as he approaches. 
MAITRE'D Mr. Miller, good to see you, sir. Your party has already arrived. 
He leads Robert and Gavin into the 
INT. POOL ROOM 
Where we see Brooke and Peter seated with a group of EXECUTIVES including AIMES (45), and BARNES (43). 
Displeasure immediately registers on Robert's face. 
ROBERT (sotto, to Gavin) Where the hell is Mayfield? 
Gavin shakes his head. They approach the table. 
BARNES (as they sit) Mr. Miller, thank you for coming. We were just getting acquainted with Brooke and Peter here. 
ROBERT (SMILING) I hope they didn't beat you up too much. 
AIMES They've been terrific. 
PETER Dad, we've been talking about operations. Tim thinks once we consolidate we can save about fifty percent on our back-office. 
Robert phone VIBRATES. It's "Julie" calling. He silences it. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 18. 
ROBERT I'd love to hear about that, but... (A BEAT) I had thought Mr. Mayfield planned to join us tonight. 
AIMES (NODS) Jim should be here in twenty minutes; he suggested we get right into details. 
BARNES I was just telling Brooke: now that we can market your quants' track records, we have access to a host of new capital that... 
Robert drifts as the suits prattle on. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. POOL ROOM - LATER 
The execs are still chattering. Robert is sweating. Julie calls again. Robert silences it again. Then he gets a text: "9:40pm - FUCK YOU." 
ROBERT Julie, you're not gonna fail. Why would you fail? 
He crosses towards her. 
ROBERT (CONT'D) You know, I'm not the kinda guy who wants to throw money away but if you wanna start a business, you have to project a certain image. 
JULIE What image? 
ROBERT Success. 
He sits down next to her. 
ROBERT (CONT'D) The market's a disaster right now; nobody's moving anything. That's why you gotta show sales. People look at you then and they say "Whoah, how'd she do that?" -- and that's what they remember. Always. 
She stares at him, laughs a little in devastation, then... Goldenrod - 4.17.11 26. 
JULIE (QUIETLY) You're never gonna leave her. 
Hold on Robert's face as he stares at her, silently. 
CUT TO: 
BEDROOM 
Julie is on the bed, holding herself, crying. 
Robert comes up next to her, hugs her. 
ROBERT Come away with me. Let's just take your car and go... 
JULIE ...Where?... 
ROBERT There's a place upstate. Very beautiful, on the water. We can wake up there together- just you and me. I'd like that. 
She's keeps crying, but... 
JULIE Me, too. 
EXT. HIGHWAY - DEAD OF NIGHT 
A MERCEDES 450 SEL driving the interstate towards Connecticut. Billie Holiday sings her 1959 "Just One More Chance." We hold on a two-shot through the windshield: Julie rests her head on Robert's shoulder. 
And the camera moves closer into Robert's face, Julie snuggled next to him, Billie's music lulling the moment into tranquility, and finally, just finally, Robert has a moment's respite, as he slowly closes his heavy eyelids, nodding off into a trance of desperately needed sleep until... 
A SCRAPING METALLIC NOISE jolts us back to 
EXT. HIGHWAY 
Reality -- as the car drifts into the CENTER MEDIAN where the tire catches on a small metal SCRAP and BLOWS OUT, flipping the car over and over until it CAREENS to a halt. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 27. 
INT. CAR 
Robert's eyes flutter open as he comes to, groggy. He's badly injured, but breathing. He starts to feel his body. Movement returns... 
He looks over at Julie. 
It is instantly obvious she is dead: she's been nearly decapitated, a deep gash ripping through her neck. 
Shock, followed quickly by panic. 
We hear a DRIPPING sound. A gas leak... 
Robert reaches into his pocket and dials 911... He looks at the phone just before pressing "Send"... and hangs up. 
He tries to open the door. It's stuck. He KICKS at it. It opens. 
EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - NIGHT 
He drags himself out of the car. Stands. Smoke is still rising from the smashed hood. He pulls up his shirt. A DEEP BRUISE: a broken rib from the steering column. He winces. 
He takes a few steps forward, moving around to the passenger side. He looks again at Julie. Horrific. He reaches out to touch her, then stops. 
Hold on his face. He sinks to his knees, putting his head in his bloody hands. He SCREAMS. 
ROBERT It's better you don't ask. 
JIMMY So all you're sayin' is, you need a ride somewhere. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 30. 
ROBERT That's correct. 
JIMMY Because I want to be very clear about this: you called me to give you a ride. I'm giving you a ride. 
ROBERT No, you're not. We're not here. 
JIMMY Oh, no? Then where the fuck are we? 
ROBERT We're both alseep right now. At home. Which is where you left your phone, right? 
JIMMY Right. 
ROBERT Because if anyone checks... 
JIMMY Why is anyone gonna check? 
ROBERT They're not, as long as we're not here. Anybody know you're here? 
JIMMY No. 
ROBERT Somebody knows you're here? 
JIMMY No! 
ROBERT But somebody knows-- you're not there. 
JIMMY Well, my girl... 
ROBERT Oh, Jesus, Jimmy... 
JIMMY Man, you call up two am, what the fuck you want? She asked me where I was going. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 31. 
ROBERT What'd you say? 
JIMMY I told her I had to run out a minute. 
A beat. 
ROBERT Do you trust her? 
JIMMY Is this the kinda shit you used to do to my dad? 
ROBERT Do you trust her? 
JIMMY Yes, I fucking trust her! 
ROBERT Good. So you're at home, and I'm at home. My wife gets up at five am for Pilates -- I will be there next to her, where I've been all night. And you'll do the same with yours. 
Jimmy exhales a long sigh. 
JIMMY This is some pretty fucked up shit. 
ROBERT Jimmy... 
JIMMY No, man, come on, I don't hear from you since the fuckin' funeral, you call me up out of the blue, using my father's name, ask me... 
ROBERT ...what do you want, you want money? I will give you five thousand dollars! I will give you ten thousand dollars! I'll give you whatever you fuckin'... 
Jimmy swerves the car to the side of the road and stops. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 32. 
JIMMY You wanna talk to me like that you can get the fuck outta my car and you can walk! You want that?! You wanna fuckin' walk home?! 
ROBERT (after a beat) Listen... I'm sorry. I'm not myself. I need your help. 
Jimmy waits a moment, then re-enters the road. 
Robert winces in pain. 
JIMMY You alright? 
BROOKE The "Old Hill" Fund. Dad, are you listening to me? 
ROBERT Of course I'm listening. (SITS FORWARD) Okay, those trades are in the special book. They don't get audited on the same balance sheet. 
BROOKE Yeah, but look at the sheet! It can't be right. There's a four hundred million dollar hole here. I mean that can't be right. 
INT. ROBERT'S OFFICE RECEPTION - CONTINUOUS 
Det. Bryer enters the glass doors and badges the RECEPTIONIST. 
RECEPTIONIST May I help you? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 40. 
BRYER Detective Bryer. I was hoping to see Mr. Miller. 
CINDY Is he expecting you? 
BRYER Possibly. 
INT. ROBERT'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
BROOKE ...the way that this sheet reads, half of the fund's assets are missing. 
ROBERT (LAUGHS) That's ridiculous. That can't be right. 
BROOKE I know, it's ridiculous, and yet... 
ROBERT Okay, I'll look into it. I promise you I'll look into it. 
The Intercom handset RINGS. 
ROBERT (CONT'D) (INTO PHONE) Yeah. 
CINDY (O.S.) There's a detective Bryer here to see you? 
ROBERT (stiffens, then into phone) Give me two minutes, then send him in... 
BROOKE Everything alright? 
ROBERT Yes, my other meeting just got here early. We'll have to pick this up later. 
BROOKE Okay. And Mom wants to know about the hospital check? 
ROBERT Brooke, we'll pick it up later, alright? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 41. 
BROOKE Okay. 
Brooke exits. Robert steels himself. 
CINDY (O.S.) Detective Bryer, hi, I'm Cindy, Mr. Miller's personal assistant, right this way. 
INT. ROBERT'S OFFICE CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS 
As Brooke exits, she and Bryer cross paths. She eyes him... He doesn't look familiar. Off Brooke, curious. 
INT. ROBERT'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
Robert leads Bryer towards two sofas where they sit opposite each other. 
ROBERT Yeah, I'm sorry to keep you waiting. You can sit there. We just heard about it. Really terrible. 
BRYER Okay, so you were an investor in her gallery? 
ROBERT Correct. 
BRYER How'd you meet her? 
ROBERT Through... I think it was a charity function. My wife and I have a foundation. 
BRYER Uh-huh. When'd you last see her? 
ROBERT Last night, at the gallery. 
BRYER Did you stay till the doors closed? 
ROBERT Alright. 
BRYER Now, I don't mean to be indelicate... 
ROBERT But you're going to be indelicate... 
BRYER Well, from what I've been able to gather, she wasn't exactly an art star. I mean, she worked for a couple a dealers in Paris, but... 
ROBERT Oh, okay, I get it, so why would I invest in her and help her find a place? 
BRYER Something like that, yeah. 
ROBERT It's very simple, detective. I invest in people I believe in. I thought she'd do well, so I backed her, she did. It's is simple as that. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 45. 
BRYER (nods, stands as Robert STANDS) Well that seems to make sense. (BEAT) So we're all good with the apartment, then? 
ROBERT Sure. 
BRYER Thanks. 
Robert shows him to the door. Bryer turns back. 
BRYER (CONT'D) What happened to your head? 
ROBERT What? 
BRYER That's a nasty cut; I've been looking at that for the last five minutes. Does it hurt you? 
ROBERT (touching the cut) Oh, no, I just hit it on the medicine cabinet. 
BRYER Last night? 
ROBERT This morning. 
BRYER Hate when that happens. 
ROBERT Yeah. Me, too. 
BRYER Well, thanks for the chat. 
ROBERT No problem. 
Bryer heads out. 
We hold on Robert as he closes the door and winces in pain. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 46. 
INT. ELLEN'S OFFICE - OUTER SUITE - DAY 
A serene khaki suite with high-post windows and white upholstered furniture. On the walls are gala posters from various charity events. 
MAE (30s) sits at a reception desk typing. The phone RINGS. 
MAE (INTO PHONE) Ellen Miller's office... 
INT. ELLEN'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
Ellen's standing, cradling the phone and packing her handbag. Across her desk, SUSAN (30s) reviews the guest list for the hospital event. 
ELLEN (INTO PHONE) And it, it transformed them, seriously. 
MAE (SOFTLY) There's a Detective Bryer in the lobby. 
Ellen holds up her hand, buying a moment. 
ELLEN (INTO PHONE) And thanks again for your generosity. Alright, we'll see you then. Thank you, bye. (hanging up, to Mae) I'm sorry, what? 
MAE Detective Bryer. 
ELLEN What does he want? 
MAE I don't know. 
Ellen smooths her suit and puts her bag over her shoulder. 
GAVIN (NODDING) Of course... Are you okay? 
ROBERT You reach Mayfield? 
The ELEVATOR arrives and Robert gets in. 
GAVIN Not yet, but we'll get him... (STARES) Robert, I... 
ROBERT Thanks. Appreciate your concern. 
Gavin's still staring as the doors close. 
EXT. CONVENT AVENUE - JIMMY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY 
PEDESTRIANS hurry by this busy stretch of Upper Manhattan. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 50. 
INT. UNDERCOVER CAR - SAME 
Bryer and Mills wait. Jimmy approaches. 
MILLS Let's flash him. 
They drive up on the sidewalk, blocking Jimmy's path, and Mills exits the car. 
EXT. JIMMY'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 
MILLS Mr. Grant? 
JIMMY Yes? 
MILLS NYPD Homicide, would you mind stepping into the car? 
JIMMY What's this about? 
BRYER (through the window) Just get in the car, Jimmy. 
JIMMY Am I under arrest? 
BRYER (through the window) You wanna be? 
INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER 
Jimmy sits across the table from Mills and Bryer. They show him PHOTOS of Julie's burned body at the crash site. 
BRYER So let's do this again. 
JIMMY Man, for what? My answers ain't gonna change. 
BRYER You were asleep. 
JIMMY Right. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 51. 
BRYER And your phone rings. 
JIMMY Right. 
BRYER And it's a wrong number. 
Jimmy doesn't answer. 
BRYER (CONT'D) Why do you accept the charges on a collect call from a wrong number? 
JIMMY I don't think I wanna answer any more questions. 
BRYER And you stay on the phone a minute and a half on a wrong number? What the fuck do you talk about, area codes? 
JIMMY I want to talk to my lawyer. 
MILLS Listen, kid, we know you went out there. We ID'd your photo with your neighbor who saw you getting into your truck ten minutes after this call was made. 
JIMMY Well if you got all that, what the fuck you need me for, officer? 
BRYER I don't think you understand the gravity of the situation here, Jimmy. This is a homicide. 
BRYER Nah, they're all dead. 
FLORES (READING) So he's a good student, magnet school, whatever. (MORE) Goldenrod - 4.17.11 59. FLORES (CONT'D) Then his mom dies and he gets popped for gun possession. Even so, how come he got probation? 
BRYER Well, he had an excellent lawyer. 
FLORES (READING CLOSER) How the fuck does this kid afford Felder and Chausse...? 
Mills drops another FOLDER on the table. 
BRYER We pulled his parents' tax returns. Guess where his father worked for twenty years? 
FLORES (READING) Miller Capital? (READING) He was the fucking driver?! (LAUGHS) Wow, this guy's good... 
He puts down the sheet and leans back. 
FLORES (CONT'D) Where are you at with the kid? 
MILLS So far he won't budge. 
FLORES Well he's a convicted felon. Go get a warrant, put him in front of a grand jury. Let's see how long he holds out when he realizes he's looking at ten years off the prior. 
INT. FREMAUT - VOGLER'S OFFICE HALLWAY - LATER 
Robert storms the hallway, passing a waiting SECRETARY. 
SECRETARY I'm sorry, Mr. Miller, as I explained from downstairs, he's on a call right now, and he said... 
He brushes past her. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 60. 
SECRETARY (CONT'D) Mr. Miller! 
INT. VOGLER'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
Robert enters, locking the door behind him. Chris bolts up. 
CHRIS What the fuck...? 
ROBERT Tell me what is going on. 
Robert comes closer. Chris is freaking out. 
CHRIS I can't. 
ROBERT Tell me what's going on! 
CHRIS I can't! 
Robert GRABS Chris by the collar. 
ROBERT Why not?! 
CHRIS It's not me! 
ROBERT What do you mean it's not...? 
CHRIS THE AUDIT PASSED! 
ROBERT (slackening his grip) The audit passed? What do you mean the audit passed? 
CHRIS It passed! It passed a week ago! Like I said. Everything's fine! We confirmed the money, it's all straight and done. 
ROBERT (BEYOND CONFUSED) Then... why did you tell me that it didn't? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 61. 
CHRIS Because they asked me to hold it. 
ROBERT They? Who's they? (thrashes him again) Who is they?! 
CHRIS Mayfield. 
ROBERT (TO HIMSELF) Mayfield? 
Robert thinks... and starts LAUGHING. Chris looks at him strangely as he walks out. 
BROOKE Then why didn't you tell me? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 64. 
ROBERT Because I hoped you wouldn't. 
BROOKE Oh, come on. You tell me the truth now -- or I am done. 
ROBERT I made a bad bet. 
BROOKE No, you committed fraud. 
ROBERT That's a dangerous word, Brooke. 
BROOKE What would you prefer? That you cheated? That you stole money from people who trusted you? That you lied? That you lied right to my face? Why? 
ROBERT Because we were going broke! Everything was finished. We'd have nothing. 
BROOKE How. How does that happen? 
ROBERT You remember Alexanderov? Well he came to see me one day last year. He said "Robert, we've got a great opportunity- there's a copper mine, it's in Russia, it's under- exploited- there's billions under the ground, and to get it out, all we need is a couple hundred million, you put in a hundred, we'll put in a hundred- we'll triple it all in six months." So, I go check it out. And the geological survey's right, friendly government. And to lock it in, you hedge it, right? Sell the copper ahead on the commodities exchange and it all works, it's fine, and you're making a fortune. (beat, then real fast) (MORE) Goldenrod - 4.17.11 65. ROBERT (CONT'D) But then there's something I hadn't accounted for-- variation margin-- and that friendly Russian government all of a sudden not so friendly anymore and they're blocking the export of the copper so I gotta make it up, I gotta put the cash in to cover the hedge. But I'm not worried about it because it's still springing money, there's so much money coming out of the ground you can't believe. You can't stop it. And, yes, I'm the oracle, I've done housing, I've arb'd credit swaps, I have done it all, and yes, again, I know it's outside the charter, but it is FUCKING MINTING MONEY! IT'S A LICENSE TO PRINT MONEY! FOR EVERYBODY! FOREVER! IT IS GOD!... 
BROOKE Until... 
ROBERT Until it's not... The money's trapped. You can't get it out. Probably never will. (BEAT) It's like a plane crash. It just happens. 
BROOKE Well it does not just happen. 
ROBERT Not just happen, honey you are so naive sometimes. It HAPPENS. And like every father I pray that it doesn't HAPPEN to you, which, thanks to me, it probably won't happen to you... 
BROOKE Thanks to you, we may all be arrested. 
ROBERT Nobody's getting arrested. That's why I borrowed the money from Jeffrey. Plug the hole, I put it there for a month, they see the books are fine, I transfer the company, I pay back Jeffrey-- with interest!-- make all of our investors whole, and what's left we keep. At least we get to keep the house. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 66. 
BROOKE Everybody wins? 
ROBERT Yes. 
BROOKE If the company sells. If I lie for you. 
ROBERT You don't have to lie. You didn't know about it. 
BROOKE (INCREDULOUS) I'm the Chief Investment Officer of this company. What do you think they'll say at the depositions? "She didn't know?" They'll take away my brokerage license- failure to supervise you -- my name in every paper and blog while I visit your ass in jail! 
ROBERT What did you want me to do? Did you want me to let our investors go bankrupt? Is that what you wanted? For people to get really hurt? 
BROOKE What... gives you the audacity to think you can make those decisions? 
ROBERT (STANDS) Because it's my job! 
BROOKE No, it's illegal. It's illegal. And I am your partner. 
ROBERT You are not my partner! You work for me! (off her bewildered stare) That's right. You work for me! (SITS) Everybody works for me! 
They pass a moment in silence. He looks at her destroyed expression. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 67. 
ROBERT (CONT'D) Brooke. Brooke. Come here. Please? Please. Just, just come here. Just for a second and sit down. 
She sits. 
ROBERT (CONT'D) (DEEP SIGH) There's something I wanna tell you. And whatever you decide I won't blame you... (she turns to look at him) I'm on my own path. It's up to you to move with it or against it. But I'm the patriarch; that's my role. And I have to play it. 
BROOKE (stares a while, then) For a moment I thought you were gonna say you were sorry. 
She walks off. 
Hold on Robert alone in the park. 
ROBERT (SOTTO) I'm sorry. 
EXT. JIMMY'S APARTMENT - DUSK 
Jimmy approaches the building. Bryer exits his sedan and walks over to him. 
JIMMY (SEEING BRYER) Oh, man, what? 
INT. ROBERT'S OFFICE - LATER THAT NIGHT 
It's nearly empty. Ramon, the limo driver, plays Solitaire at a COMPUTER. Robert sits with Syd in the next room. 
SYD He's gonna walk. 
ROBERT You're certain? 
SYD Courts aren't for certainty, but he says he was at home, why shouldn't he be? A phone call doesn't make him a liar. (off Robert's nod) But what's baffling to me, though, despite your sentimental history together, is why you would put your family's future in this kid's hands. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 71. 
ROBERT (BEAT) He's not like us. 
SYD Is that a good thing? 
ROBERT (laughs, plays with his SCOTCH GLASS) I don't know. 
Robert stands and collects PAPERS into his BRIEFCASE. 
SYD How's Ellen? 
ROBERT She's good. Fine. (stops packing, looks up) Why? 
SYD I heard something... 
ROBERT Yes...? 
SYD She met with Gil Deuchman. 
ROBERT The estate lawyer? 
SYD Yeah. Has she mentioned anything? 
ROBERT Not to me. 
They sit in silence. 
INT. CRIMINAL COURT - FELONY INDICTMENTS - THE NEXT DAY 
We see Jimmy in the witness box before 23 GRAND JURORS. The prosecutor, DeFerlito, asks questions. Earl Monroe sits next to Jimmy. 
DEFERLITO That was the early morning of April 11th. 
JIMMY Yes. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 72. 
DEFERLITO You received a phone call? 
JIMMY Yes. 
DEFERLITO Who called you? 
Jimmy stares at DeFerlito. 
JIMMY It was a wrong number. 
DEFERLITO That's a lie, isn't it, Mr. Grant? 
JIMMY No. 
DEFERLITO You stayed on the phone one-and-a- half minutes... Mr. Grant, isn't it the case that you know exactly who called you and exactly why? Why are you lying to this court? 
JIMMY I'm not lying. 
DeFerlito turns and walks back to the prosecutor's table. He picks up a PHOTOGRAPH and hands it to a CLERK. 
DEFERLITO I'm going to introduce into evidence People's A. This is a toll booth photograph taken in the northbound ninth lane of the Triborough bridge. Mr. Grant, directing your attention to the photograph, would you please read the date and time stamp indicated on the lower right hand corner? 
Jimmy stares at the photograph in disbelief. 
JIMMY This is crazy. 
EARL (whispers in Jimmy's ear) You're gonna have to answer that. 
DEFERLITO Mr. Grant, please answer the question. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 73. 
JIMMY That picture was some bullshit... 
EARL ...Jimmy, stop! Detective, what's going on? 
BRYER Well, tell him. Go ahead, Jimmy. Tell him. See how the boss'll like this one. 
Earl stares at Jimmy, waiting. The bell RINGS. 
BRYER (CONT'D) Last chance. 
Jimmy's silent. Bryer shakes his head and walks off. 
EARL (rising, to Jimmy) Wait here. 
Bryer and Earl enter the courtroom. 
CLOSE ON: Goldenrod - 4.17.11 76. 
Jimmy, as he stares out the 11th floor window towards Brooklyn. In the distance, the Woolworth building. 
INT. FRANK CAMPBELL FUNERAL HOME - DAY 
About thirty people in a room too big for them. At the front are tasteful flower BOUQUETS surrounding Julie's CASKET. 
Robert enters and spots some of the people from the art opening, including Julie's gallery assistant. She looks at him quietly, then quickly looks away. 
There is no organized service; people are just walking up to the casket and saying prayers. Robert takes his place and holds a moment at the casket. 
The gallery assistant comes up behind him. 
ASSISTANT Mr. Miller. I would like to introduce you to Julie's mom, Sandrine. 
A beautiful woman in her 50's, SANDRINE, sits crying. Robert approaches as she stands. 
ROBERT I am so, so sorry. 
SANDRINE (nods, then) I just wanted to thank you for what you did for my daughter. 
ROBERT (shaking his head softly) No... 
SANDRINE You believed in her, and you gave her a chance. She was happy. I know she was happy. 
ROBERT It's just... (EMOTIONAL) not fair, is it? 
Sandrine starts to tear. Robert moves in and HUGS her, hard. 
ROBERT (CONT'D) (WHISPERS) This shouldn't have happened. 
Hold on Sandrine's face, in pain. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 77. 
INT. ROBERT'S MANSION - GYM - MORNING 
Close on Brooke's legs, running on a treadmill. Ellen exercises on a STAIRMASTER next to her. We hear the sound of Ellen's small talk begin to fade in. 
ELLEN ...she's rail thin. She's a blond. I would not have known who she was if she hadn't come up and introduced herself to me. She looked totally different... and... (notices Brooke increasing the machine's resistance) You're going straight to level six don't you think you better pace yourself a little bit? 
BROOKE (fakes a smile) I'm good. I wanna run. 
ELLEN Everything okay with you and Tom? 
BROOKE We're fine. 
ELLEN Are you worried about the deal closing? 
BROOKE (STRIDES FASTER) No. 
ELLEN You want me to guess? (NO RESPONSE) Brookie, come on, don't be silly, tell me what's... 
Brooke stabs "Stop" on the machine, quickly cooling down. 
BROOKE (heading to pick up her BELONGINGS) You know, I can't stay for breakfast I have to just... I have to get in to work, I don't know what I was thinking. 
ELLEN (A BEAT) Did you uh, finish the deal with the hospital? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 78. 
ROBERT Five-fifty. 
MAYFIELD Four-fifty. 
ROBERT Five twenty-five. That's it. Yes or no? (SHORT BEAT) And if it's no, send any further communication right to my trash can. 
MAYFIELD (extending his hand) It's a deal. 
ROBERT (GRASPING IT) One other thing -- six months and I'm gonna be gone. I'm outta here. My daughter's gonna take it over. You know her, you trust her. 
MAYFIELD Alright. 
ROBERT And you're gonna have to make my son a VP. 
MAYFIELD (LAUGHS) Robert... 
ROBERT No, no. He doesn't have to do anything, he just gets the salary, he gets the office. Both of `em on five-year employment contracts, and my lawyers draft them. Yes or no? 
MAYFIELD Yes. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 82. 
Robert pulls out a pen and jots down the deal points they have just outlined onto the paper menu. 
MAYFIELD (CONT'D) What are you doing? 
ROBERT I'm writing the deal. 
MAYFIELD Are you serious? 
ROBERT (ripping off the tablecloth) I'm serious. I'm very serious. Sign it. 
Mayfield thinks a moment, then reaches over and signs the menu. Robert does the same and then folds it into his pocket. 
MAYFIELD I'll send over a draft of the press release. 
As Robert stands to go, he clutches his bruised rib. 
MAYFIELD (CONT'D) Are you all right? 
ROBERT I'm fine... Before I go -- how much would you have paid...? 
MAYFIELD Six hundred. And you would've taken...? 
ROBERT Four seventy-five. 
MAYFIELD So we made a good deal. 
ROBERT (as he heads away) Yeah. 
Robert turns back to the table. 
ROBERT (CONT'D) Actually, I lied. I would've taken four. 
Mayfield shrugs and returns to his paper. Robert walks out of the restaurant, beaming. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 83. 
INT. MILLER CAPITAL - CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER 
Peter, Gavin, and many of the various STAFF we have met are gathered around a long conference table. Robert stands at the front of the room. 
ROBERT ...Anyway I will be seeing most of you at the gala tomorrow night. But as the sale's official as of this afternoon, you are now free to talk about it. Any questions? 
PETER (JOVIAL) Will we get new business cards? 
ROBERT (NODS) Yes, everyone but you. (HEADING OUT) Alright, it's a great day. Your hard work made it happen 
They all clap as Gavin and Robert exit the room. 
GAVIN (SOTTO) So how'd you make Mayfield come around? 
ROBERT I met his price. I just took it out of your share. 
GAVIN Robert? 
ROBERT Yeah. 
JIMMY Hey, this is my fuckin' life, man! Earl's telling me it could be ten years? Ten fucking years! How much are ten years worth, Robert? (off his silence) Goldenrod - 4.17.11 86. 
JIMMY (CONT'D) Look man, I told you, I ain't no fuckin snitch, but this is bad. This is real bad. Reina and I got a whole plan we're about to make happen next week! 
ROBERT (as Jimmy sits) What plan? 
JIMMY I got money saved up; I'm buying a business. 
ROBERT What business? 
JIMMY I bought an Applebee's. 
ROBERT What's an Applebee's? 
JIMMY It's a fucking restaurant, man, it's a chain restaurant. 
ROBERT You bought an Applebee's in Virginia? 
JIMMY Is this really what you came here to talk about? What are you gonna do? 
ROBERT (SITS) It's not really that simple, Jimmy. I'm in a situation now. 
JIMMY What situation? 
ROBERT I told you... right now, if I were to speak, a lot of people would get hurt. Jobs, families. A lot of innocent people. Do you think you can understand that? 
JIMMY Yeah but what about me? What about my situation? (off his silence) They showed me pictures, man; that's fucked up what you did. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 87. 
ROBERT (SOTTO) It was an accident. 
JIMMY And yeah, I know, all the people counting on you, whatever, but -- you told me Earl was gonna make this right. Now you know I care about you, all the things you did for us, and for my father, but Earl said they're offering me a deal, no charges at all. I walk away. They just want to know who I went to pick up. (BEAT) Why are you putting me in this position, man? Why are you putting me in this situation? 
ROBERT (LEANS FORWARD) Can you just hang tight? Just a little longer? 
JIMMY Alright, man, but Earl said the deal's on the table for twenty-four hours. After that, they're filing the case, and Earl says we're gonna lose. 
ROBERT (nods, stands) Alright I hear you. I'll be back with you as soon as I can. Just hang with me a little bit. 
Jimmy nods. Robert walks out. Reina crosses back into the living room as he approaches the door and exits. 
REINA You gotta give him up. 
JIMMY You said take the money. 
REINA That was to keep quiet, not to go away. (BEAT) What's he offering you now? 
JIMMY What can he offer me? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 88. 
Reina crosses to Jimmy and hugs him as he starts to cry, then wipes away his tears. 
INT. ROBERT'S LIMO - NIGHT 
The limo drives down Fifth Avenue. Robert's on the phone. 
SYD (O.S.) We went to the toll authority. They said they gave the tape to the cops. I've requested our investigator go examine it at the evidence room, but honestly what's the point? 
ROBERT He says he didn't take the toll. 
SYD (O.S.) And you believe him? 
ROBERT (after a beat) Does Standard have clawback? 
SYD (O.S.) What? What do you mean? 
ROBERT Let's just say I decide to go in... 
SYD (O.S.) Have you lost your mind? 
ROBERT No, just listen, listen to me. If I were to surrender, now, could they roll back the deal? 
SYD (O.S.) (after a beat) No, what's done is done. There's no intent to defraud. You haven't warranted any behavior. So it's just money. 
ROBERT Four years, you think? 
Syd lays the PHOTOGRAPH we saw earlier of Jimmy's car going through the toll onto the counter next to the one Earl has just placed there. 
Robert picks up a high-end MAGNIFYING GLASS and leans over to look at the two photos. 
CLOSE-UP: 
He scans the photograph of Earl's car, moving slowly through it left-to-right. 
Then he scans the photograph of Jimmy's car, passing left-to- right until -- 
He passes back by the license plate area and stops -- 
The lines around the license plate of Jimmy's car are all slightly-pixelated. 
He switches back to the plate on Earl's car. The lines are fine. Back to Jimmy's. Pixelated. 
Robert puts down the magnifier, straightens, and smiles. 
ROBERT (CONT'D) Son of a bitch. 
Earl's dark laugh cackles across the soundtrack as we 
CUT TO: 
INT. JUDGE'S CHAMBERS - THE NEXT DAY 
Earl sits across from DA Deferlito and Bryer. JUDGE RITTENBAND reviews both TOLL PHOTOS with a MAGNIFYING GLASS. 
RITTENBAND Well they look a little different to me, too... Is there a reason you haven't allowed Mr. Monroe's investigator to conduct his own analysis? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 92. 
DEFERLITO We've had some issues regarding chain-of-custody... 
RITTENBAND ...You don't have them anymore. You're to meet him with the evidence in the next hour. 
DEFERLITO I'm afraid that's not possible. 
A beat. 
RITTENBAND Where's the tape? (ANOTHER BEAT) Am I not speaking loud enough? 
BRYER Your honor... 
RITTENBAND Yes? 
DEFERLITO It seems there's been... 
RITTENBAND ...Let him tell me. 
BRYER We don't know where it is. 
RITTENBAND Come again? 
BRYER It's not in the evidence locker. 
RITTENBAND Where is it? 
BRYER We don't know. 
Silence. Rittenband leans forward. 
RITTENBAND I'll ask you one last time, detective. Where is the tape? 
BRYER (after a beat) We lost it. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 93. 
RITTENBAND Hmmm... In light of these developments, and I would think you should be very happy to hear this, with Mr. Monroe's approval I'm going to offer Mr. Deferlito the opportunity to voluntarily dismiss the indictment to save us all a bunch of embarrassment. 
DEFERLITO I don't feel comfortable with that, your honor. 
RITTENBAND Further I'm going to put all charges against Mr. Grant under seal. (Bryer starts heading to THE DOOR) This case is dismissed with prejudice and it is not to be refiled. HOLD ON, Detective. (Bryer stops.) If you have another suspect in the automobile death then you are to present him, but Mr. Grant is free from any further inquiry in this matter. This is over. Do I have your understanding? 
EARL Thank you. 
Deferlito gets up angrily, huffs past Bryer. 
ROBERT Did she tell you that? 
ELLEN No. She didn't have to. 
ROBERT Yeah, I explained to Brooke that... 
ELLEN ...you explained, did you? (A BEAT) Did you tell her everything? 
ROBERT Yes. 
ELLEN Everything? (off his silence) Lift up your shirt. 
ROBERT What? 
ELLEN Lift up -- your shirt. 
He doesn't move. 
She stands and heads towards him. Then she hits him with a a NEWSPAPER, right at his broken rib. 
He winces a little, then looks down at the floor. 
It's the Post article chronicling Julie's death. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 97. 
ELLEN (CONT'D) Did you tell her about that? 
ROBERT (LONG BEAT) Ellen I don't know what you think you know... 
ELLEN Oh, don't treat me like an idiot. You've been sneaking off to see her for months. You don't think I know that? 
ROBERT What do you think you know? 
ELLEN I never cared, really, about your secretaries, your- gallerists, whores, whatever you wanna call them. I cared about our home. And now you have brought this to our door. 
ROBERT I did what was necessary. 
ELLEN No you did what was necessary for you, Robert, for your interests. 
ROBERT For my interests? 
ELLEN Yes. 
ROBERT Everything I do is for us, for this family, and now you're gonna tell me how to run my business. 
ELLEN This isn't about your business, this is our life! Where do you think we're going tonight? Why do you think I've even tolerated this for so long? 
ROBERT (he's had enough) What you've tolerated? Wow! 
ELLEN I'm glad you find that funny. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 98. 
ROBERT What about me? What about the complaints? The unhappiness? The drinking? The shopping? The trainers? Everything! But yes, the charities, the wonderful sainted charities, you know, all the wonderful works that you do. How do you think I've paid for them? 
ELLEN I didn't ask you because I didn't want you to lie. 
ROBERT (WALKS OFF) It's cause you didn't want to give `em up! 
ELLEN But I thought that we had an understanding. And you broke that understanding when you brought Brooke into it. 
ROBERT No, I kept her out. 
ELLEN When you made Brooke complicit-- when you risked her future-- and I'm done. 
She opens a FOLDER revealing some legal documents, slides them toward him. 
ROBERT What is this? 
ELLEN Read it. 
He crosses to the bed and puts on his glasses. We see the title: "SEPARATION AGREEMENT" and hold on him reading for a few brief seconds until... 
ROBERT "All ownership and voting rights transfer to the Miller Charitable Foundation, to be administered by Brooke Miller?" Did you really expect me to sign this thing? 
ELLEN You're not following. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 99.

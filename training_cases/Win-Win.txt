EXT. WATCHUNG RESERVATION - DAWN. 
It's a bitter cold January morning. The woods are quiet. Desolate. In the far off distance a man is jogging. He banks around the end of a small pond and runs right at us. This is MIKE FLAHERTY, FORTY-TWO. He is running hard. Or at least as hard as he can. 
Suddenly TWO JOGGERS blow past him. 
INT. HOUSE, BEDROOM - SAME. 
A HOME MADE STAIN GLASS ANGEL hangs on a window. It falls to the ground. 
ABBY FLAHERTY, SIX-YEARS OLD, stirs and gets out of her bed out. She picks up the Bird and inspects it. It's broken. 
ABBY Shit. 
INT. HOUSE, BEDROOM - LATER. 
JACKIE FLAHERTY, THIRTY-SEVEN is still sleeping. Abby walks into the room. Jackie opens her eyes. 
ABBY (WHISPERS) Mommy, can we play croquet today?

ABBY (CONT'D) Where's Daddy? 
JACKIE He's running. 
ABBY From what? 
Jackie smiles.

JACKIE (CONT'D) How was the run? 
MIKE JACKIE Good. It was good. Abby, finish your cereal. 
JACKIE (CONT'D) (TO MIKE) I'm very impressed with you keeping it up. 
Mike shrugs and takes a yogurt from the refrigerator. 
ABBY I don't like it. 
JACKIE You do too, so stop drawing and eat. 
MIKE ABBY What brand is this? Daddy, look. It's your team. 
JACKIE (CONT'D) They're all the same. 
Mike looks at the drawing. It looks nothing like a team. 
MIKE That's my team? That's great, honey. Are they winning? 
ABBY Yeah. 
JACKIE Maybe you should show the team. 5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 3 CONTINUED: 
Abby knocks over a glass of water. It spills onto the drawing. 
ABBY Shit.

Off Mike's look. 
JACKIE (CONT'D) What? Don't look at me. 
MIKE Uh huh. Bye sweetie. 
He kisses Abby. 
ABBY MIKE Bye daddy. Bye. 
JACKIE Hey. You OK?

MIKE That guy's starting another fund? 
TERRY Yeah. He's an animal. He prints money. Come on, let's finish strong. 
Terry starts to run. Mike follows. After about thirty feet, Mike pulls up. He's breathing is labored. 
MIKE Hold up! 
TERRY What? 
MIKE Just...hold up. 
Mike is really breathing hard now. He's making some funny noises.

TERRY (CONT'D) Holy fuck! Mike? Hang on pal. 
Terry takes out his black berry but immediately fumbles it into the wet mud. 
TERRY (CONT'D) Fuck! Fuck! 
He grabs it and shakes it out but it's dead. 
TERRY (CONT'D) You gotta be kidding me. Shit. 
Mike is still wheezing. Terry turns his attention. 
TERRY (CONT'D) Is it your heart, buddy? Are you having a heart attack? 
MIKE No! I'm not having a heart attack! I just...can't breathe... 
TERRY That could be a heart attack, Mike. You should lie down. 
Terry tries to help him but it's only seems to annoy Mike. 
MIKE TERRY Get off me! Just lie down. 
MIKE No! It's wet. I don't want to lie down. 
TERRY Who cares? You might be dying. Are you cold? Do you feel cold? 
MIKE Yeah. I'm lying on the ground.

TERRY OK dude, how long has that been happening?

MIKE (CONT'D) And, as his lawyer, I feel like I'm in a better position to execute what my client wants. 
THATCHER Your Honor, Mr. Flaherty is Mr. Poplar's court appointed attorney... 
JUDGE LEE I know, Stu, I appointed him. 
THATCHER Yeah, well that hardly qualifies him to be Leo's Guardian. What's the motivation here? 
Thatcher is turning up the heat. He obviously wants Poplar. Mike is starting to feel it. 
JUDGE LEE Mike? 
Mike looks back at Leo who is trying to unscrew the cap on his water bottle, completely uninterested in the proceedings. He makes a decision. 
MIKE Your Honor, Leo told me he wants to live at home. He has the money to do that and I want to make sure that happens. If the State can do that then fine. 
THATCHER Counsel knows we can't do that, your Honor. (MORE) 5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 21 CONTINUED: THATCHER (CONT'D) We're spread too thin for that kind of individual attention. But they have an excellent elder care facility in Mr. Poplar's town. We'll put him there.

MIKE Yeah, well I think she heard that I'm a lawyer and I have a family and that was good enough. 
JACKIE For how long?

KYLE You ever think about wrestling in a match? 5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 69 CONTINUED: 
STEMLER Yeah. I'm just waiting for the green light from Coach. But I'm glad I'm not wrestling today. These guys are ranked fourth in the state. And you're wrestling Kenny Randall. He's undefeated. He is tough! Really tough. 
KYLE Thanks for letting me know. 
Vigman stands up at the front of the bus. 
VIGMAN Hey! Cut the chatter! You should all be playing the "what if" game. What if he shoots a single leg? What if he controls my wrists? 
STEMLER What if we all get pinned like last year? 
VIGMAN Shut up, Stemler! Or I'll throw you off the bus myself! 
Vigman sits back down next to Terry.

VIGMAN Just about. It's gonna be a fucking bloodbath.

VIGMAN Nerves. 
TERRY Sweet Lord. This is a team for the ages. 
Kyle knocks on the door. Stemler is with him. 
MIKE What's up, guys? 
KYLE Stemler wants to wrestle today. 
MIKE You do? 
STEMLER Yeah, Coach. I'm pretty sure I'm ready. Right? 
KYLE Right. 
MIKE Where you gonna wrestle? 5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 75 CONTINUED: 
KYLE He could wrestle 119. I could bump up and get a pin at 125 and Jimmy goes 130. Then we're only giving up one weight class and we got a shot. 
Vig and Terry look at Mike. 
MIKE Huh. Vig? 
VIG Yeah. He's right. It's possible. 
TERRY Have you ever wrestled in a match before Stemler? 
STEMLER No, I have not. 
KYLE You're just waiting for the green light, right?

Stemler looks over. His eyes are wild. 
MIKE (CONT'D) You need to get up! He's trying to drown you! He wants you dead. But you are not going to die on the bottom! Do you hear me? Do you?! 
Stemler manages a nod, albeit a terrified one. 
MIKE (CONT'D) Good! Now just do the move we worked on in practice. 
Off Stemler's confused look.

The Other kid frantically tries to take him down but Stemler holds him off dancing wildly around the mat. The buzzer sounds. The team goes nuts.

INT. NEW PROVIDENCE HIGHSCHOOL, HALLWAY - LATER. 
Mike and Kyle walk through the empty hallway. 
MIKE Hey, I'm proud of what you did today. That win meant a lot to the guys. 
KYLE Cool. It was good coaching with Stemler. 5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 80 CONTINUED: 
Mike laughs. Then he just looks at Kyle. 
MIKE Let me ask you something. What's it like? Being as good as you are? What's it feel like?

MIKE Yeah, I do. Must be nice. 
KYLE It is. 
INT. UNION HIGHSCHOOL - DAY 
The DISTRICT TOURNAMENT. Kyle is ahead in points going into the second period. He chooses the top position. The Ref blows the whistle and the OTHER WRESTLER sits out and Kyle simply sucks him onto his back. It almost looks too easy.

KYLE What are you doing here? 
CINDY I came to get you, honey. And to see Grandpa. I missed you so much. Can I have a hug, baby?

LEO Where's he going? 
CINDY Oh, he's just had to go somewhere, Dad. Do you want some juice? 
INT. MIKE AND JACKIE'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT. 
Mike is watching Stella who is playing on the ground. Jackie comes up from the basement. 
MIKE How is he? 
JACKIE He's upset. I don't blame him. It's weird that she just shows up like that. (Checking her watch) And of course she's late, the druggie. 
MIKE You know Kyle's doing really well with wrestling here, Cindy. The regions are this weekend and if he wins there then he goes to the states. 
CINDY That's great. 
MIKE Yeah. It is and it could be really good for him. It might even mean a scholarship. Anyway, I was wondering if you could stay here for another three weeks until that's all over. 5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 85 CONTINUED: 
Cindy thinks about it. 
CINDY I'd like to but don't think I can afford to stay in the hotel for that long. Do you think we could stay in my dad's house? 
This is not what Mike wanted but he's stuck. 
MIKE Uhh...yeah. We could probably make that work. 
CINDY Then, yeah, I could stay. 
MIKE OK. Good. That's great.

CINDY Maybe I'll just go back to the hotel. It might just be too much for him tonight. I can see him tomorrow. 
MIKE You sure? 
CINDY Yeah. I think maybe that's better. I know how Kyle can be. 
MIKE OK. I'll drop you off. 
Mike keeps driving. 
INT. MIKE'S NEIGHBORHOOD - EARLY MORNING. 
Mike and Kyle are jogging. Kyle's mood is dark. 
KYLE So when wrestling's over I have to go? 
MIKE I'm afraid so, pal. She's staying so you can finish the season. That's pretty nice of her. 
They arrive back at Mike's house. Mike is really winded. 
MIKE (CONT'D) I told her you'd go see her today, Kyle. 
KYLE Where? 5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 87 CONTINUED:

MIKE Yeah. She just told me today. 
KYLE You're not gonna let her do that are you? 
MIKE I don't know Kyle. It's complicated. 
KYLE What's complicated about it? She doesn't give a shit about Leo. They hate each other. You can't let her take him. 
MIKE OK. OK. Look, just go get ready for practice and I'll deal with it. 
KYLE Fine but I told her I'm staying with you guys until we leave. 
Kyle leaves. Terry just looks at Mike. 
TERRY Wow. What's your play? 
MIKE I have no idea. I have no freaking idea! 
TERRY She's looking for a payout, dude. Just buy her stake and give her an exit. 
MIKE What the hell does that mean? 
TERRY Just give her some of Leo's money and send her home. He's not gonna miss it. He's in happy land. 5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 92 CONTINUED: 
MIKE No, I can't do that. She's not even in his...

MIKE (CONT'D) That's right. She's not and she doesn't and that's my play. 
TERRY What's your play? 
Mike takes out his phone and dials. 
MIKE Don't worry about it. I just need to make a call. Can you get practice started?

Mike is siting down with Eleanor and Cindy. 
ELEANOR So do we. 
MIKE Good, well, I thought I'd start by laying all the cards on the table, so maybe you can understand why I'm hesitating in turning Leo over to Cindy. 5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 93 CONTINUED: 
ELEANOR OK. 
MIKE Cindy, your father disinherited you from his will. Completely. And I'm afraid that can't change now that he's been declared incapacitated. 
CINDY (TO ELEANOR) Is that true? 
ELEANOR We'll have to see a copy of the will, Mike. 
MIKE Yeah. I actually brought you a copy. 
Mike reaches into his briefcase and puts the A COPY OF THE WILL on Eleanor's desk. 
CINDY Who did he leave it too? Did he leave it to Kyle?! 
MIKE No. 
CINDY Then who? You? 
MIKE No. He left everything to the municipal parks system. He wanted the town park dedicated in his name. 
CINDY That scumbag! He never cared about anyone but himself and his fucking money. Did you know about this? 
ELEANOR Cindy please! 
CINDY Please what? 5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 94 CONTINUED: 
ELEANOR (Annoyed to Mike) I'd like to discuss this with my client, Mr. Flaherty. 
CINDY What's to discuss? I'm not taking care of him if I'm not getting anything for it. 
ELEANOR Cindy, please. (TO MIKE) We're finished here. 
MIKE OK. 
Mike gets up and walks out. A smile creeps across his face. 
Mike, Terry and Kyle walk out of the school. The entire family is waiting for them. Jackie gives Kyle a big hug. Abby takes his hand. They all get into their car. Mike is just about to get in but then he sees Cindy standing by her car watching. He shuts his door and crosses to her. 
MIKE Why are you here? 
CINDY I wanted to see my son wrestle. 
MIKE Yeah, well your son had a pretty good chance to do something special in there. Maybe even change his life and that's gone now. I hope you're happy. 
CINDY That's not my fault. 
MIKE It isn't? Why do you think he lost his shit in there, huh?! What do you want, lady? 
CINDY I want my father. 5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 98 CONTINUED: 
MIKE It didn't sound like that the other day. It sounded like you hated the guy. 
CINDY You have no idea what my father used to be like. No idea! He wasn't like he is now! He treated me like shit and he was all I had! 
MIKE So now you want to return the favor? Is that it?! 
CINDY I want that commission! That should be mine! 
MIKE And that's why you're doing all this? For fifteen hundred dollars a month? 
CINDY Isn't that why you did it? 
This stops Mike in his tracks. 
MIKE Alright, I'll tell you what. You want the commission? You can have it. And you don't even have to take Leo. I'll take care of him for free and I'll send you the check every month. On one condition. 
CINDY What's that? 
MIKE You leave Kyle here. With us. Until he finishes high school. 
CINDY I'm his mother. He belongs with me. 
MIKE Are you sure he feels that way? 5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 99 CONTINUED: 
CINDY Don't tell me what my son feels! He's coming with me and there isn't anything you can do about that. 
MIKE Then you can't have that commission. 
CINDY We'll see about that. 
MIKE Yeah, we will. 
Mike turns and walks away. 
CINDY I want to see my son! 
MIKE Then call him! You have his number!

MIKE You OK? 
TERRY No. 
Terry drinks. Mike watches him. Jackie pops out from the kitchen. 
JACKIE Mike, your mom's here and dinner's almost ready. Have you seen Kyle?

Mike shrugs. 
JACKIE (CONT'D) What are we gonna do, Mike? 
MIKE There's nothing to do. I can't stop her. She's gonna leave and she's gonna take Kyle and Leo with her. 
JACKIE And you don't think you'd beat her in court? 
MIKE Kyle, listen, I just wanted to say I'm sorry... 
KYLE I know, Mike, you're sorry. Everyone's always sorry. 
MIKE I moved Leo back home, Kyle. And I'm gonna fight to keep him there.

MIKE Maybe but I'm still gonna try. 
KYLE So what?! You want me to forgive you now? Is that it, Mike?! 
MIKE No. I just want you to give me another chance. That's all I'm asking. 
Mike's sincerity is undeniable. Kyle looks to Jackie. They connect. Kyle shakes his head, turns around, and then throws his bag. 
KYLE This is bullshit! 
Mike looks at Jackie. 
MIKE Hey, Kyle, listen - 
KYLE I want to be alone. 
MIKE What? 
KYLE (Without looking at them) I JUST WANT TO BE DOWN HERE ALONE!

Mike is sitting alone at the kitchen table drinking a cup of coffee. The remnants of a pancake breakfast are on the table. There is one clean plate where Kyle usually sits. 
After a moment, Kyle comes up from the basement and sits down at the table without saying anything. 
He just looks at Mike. Then he serves himself a few pancakes. Mike passes him the bottle of syrup. He takes it and puts some on his pancakes. 
He eats. Mike watches.

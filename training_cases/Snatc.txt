SNATCH 
By Guy Ritchie 
Draft 4                    FOR EDUCATIONAL August/9/1999               PURPOSES ONLY 
1·    EXT. RUSSIA -- NIGHT 
We open on a GUARD sitting in front of a sentry post. He is wearing a heavy fur hat that covers his ears and a military- jacket. Behind him is a list of instructions (in Russian). He 'sucks in a cigarette as though he's a drowning man lookin for oxygen. A CAR comes to a stop by the sentry post, the, guard looks, asks a couple of questions and is given an -envelope which he quickly examines, he then attempts to stick his head in the car. A gun barrel is promptly stuck in his face and a couple of angry words emanate from the back, the guard jumps back and quickly raises the barrier. 
This next section will be intercut with the credit sequence. 
2    INT. BACK OF RUSSIAN CAR -- NIGHT 
On the back seat is FRANKY FOUR -FINGERS, (New York street wise Jew) who is clutching a fancy looking briefcase which is handcuffed to his wrist. He is flanked by TWO RUSSIAN HOODS. This next section will be subtitled. 
FRANKY FOUR FINGERS 
How much further do we have to go? Just then the car comes to a standstill. The window is wound down and a gun barrel is stuck through. The RUSSIAN DRIVER looks dramatically calm. 
RUSSIAN 
Pass him the money. Franky hesitates for a second. 
RUSSIAN (CONT'D) 
Franky you know you have no choice. So please can we get on with it? Franky knows discussion is futile. He flips the case open and pulls out a transparent plastic bag full of American dollars. The package is pulled out of the window, the driver doesn't move, we dissolve for a passage of time, the anxiety is more than obvious, but Four Fingers can do nothing. All of a sudden a package comes through the window and the car speeds off without waiting for an inspection of the delivery. 
(CONTINUED) 
2   CONTINUED: 
Franky opens the package and he reveals a stone the size of a fist. He shines a torch onto it and puts a stone inspectin monocle to his eye. He's satisfied. 
CUT TO: MUSIC,A CLOSE UP OF THE DIAMOND. MIX TO: ANOTHER

ON FOR THE DURATION OF THE CREDITS. CUT BACK TO: 
Franky Four Fingers opens a fancy case, presses a hidden catch, this reveals a second wall within the case, he then carefully places the stone within this secret compartment and firmly closes the case. The Russian next to him is playing with a revolver, he spins the chamber. 
RUSSIAN (CONT'D) 
If you need a man in London then call this number. Franky takes the card looks at it and repeats the name. 
. FRANKY FOUR FINGERS 
Boris? 
RUSSIAN 
Boris, Boris can get you anything you need. 
CUT TO:CU OF SPINNING GUN CHAMBER 
3   INT. LONDON - AMUSEMENT ARCADE -- DAY 
C UT TO:CU OF SPINNING GUN CHAMBER 
We are in the back room of an amusement arcade and can hear fruit machines beeping in the distance. Meet BORIS THE BLADE and TOMMY who is toying with a heavy-looking revolver. 
TOMMY 
It's a bit heavy isn't it Boris? 
BORIS 
Heavy is good. Heavy is reliable. If it doesn't work you can hit him with it. Tommy practices a couple of gun slinging maneuvers. He's impressed. At that moment the door opens and in walks a MAN carrying two heavy sacks of coins. He's a rough looking bastard, he's massive, and extremely ugly. Meet GORGEOUS 
GEORGE. 
(CONTINUED) 
3     CONTINUED: 
TOMMY 
Yes Gorgeous? George looks at the weapon and can see that he's interrupting. 
GORGEOUS GEORGE 
Sorry Tommy, I hope that I am not interrupting. 
TOMMY 
Oh of course you're not interrupting Gorgeous, I put the do not disturb sign on the door because I wanted you to join us. George isn't too bright 
GORGEOUS GEORGE 
What are you doing Tommy? 
TOMMY 
I am baking a cake Gorgeous, not that i t ' s any of your business. Put the takings down, and be a good chap. -. George puts down the coins. Tommy implies he should leave. Gorgeous isn't too bright and continues to stand there looking stupid. Tommy goes to turn around but can see that he hasn't left, so he turns back, 
TOMMY (CONT'D) 
Is there anything else Gorgeous, a cup of tea perhaps? No? Well in that could you kindly fuck off and shut the door behind you? 
Tommy turns round to Boris with a slight shake of his head. 
TOMMY (CONT'D) 
Not too bright but he hits like a train. OK I ' l l take it. You're a gambling man Boris, so I'll toss you for it. Heads it's mine, tails I'll give you twice the price. Boris chews this for a second. 
BORIS 
I ' l l toss the coin. He tosses the coin 
CUT TO: CU OF SPINNING COIN 
4   INT. NEW YORK_OFFICE -- DAY 
CUT TO :CU OF SPINNING COIN 
Meet HANDS. On the phone. Cool young street wise NY diamond dealer. He catches a coin. 
BRICK TOP (CONT'D) 
Which one was it that kept the four grand from the Clapham job? Pause 
BRICK TOP (CONT'D) 
Don't let me ask again. I would like answers, but I am not in the mood for asking questions, get busy lads, or it's feeding time, oink, oink, know what I mean? Liam takes a step to the side and moves his eyes in a sideways action implying the guilt lies with Gary. Gary catches this and opens his mouth to protest. One of Brick Tops's henchmen, ERROL, sticks a belt in there as quick as it opens and smashes a bar across Gary's legs, he buckles. The henchman man pulls out a plastic bag and a roll of tape. 
BRICK TOP (CONT'D') 
You know what to do with that don't you Liam? 
CUT TO FIGHTERS. SMALLER FIGHTER IS DISTRACTED. 
HARRIS 
Don't look for your sake. 
(CONTINUED) 
7   CONTINUED:   (2) 
POV of Smaller Fighter, we witness Liam putting the bag over Gary's head and tying tape round his neck. Gary tries to resist but it's futile and we vaguely witness the demise of poor Gary. 
CUT TO BRICK TOP 
BRICK TOP 
You're a ruthless cunt Liam, I' l l give you that. Brick Top turns away at this point to admire his fighter. 
BRICK TOP (CONT'D) 
But I got no time for grasses. 
We cut to see Liam's panic filled eyes. The bar comes down again. Brick Top finds more interest in his fighter. 
BRICK TOP (CONT'D) 
Feed em to the pigs Errol. With a short beat. 
BRICK TOP (CONT'D) 
He's looking good, Bomber, is he not? How's their man getting on? We whip pan off Brick Top's boxing ring... 
8   EXT. ANOTHER BACK ALLEY MAKESHIFT BOXING RING - - DAY 
...And the whip pan shot takes us into this boxing ring. Meet TURKISH, he is Tommy's partner. Turkish is older and wiser than Tommy, they are both watching Gorgeous go through his paces. Gorgeous George is head butting a heavy punch bag. The sound that emanates is disturbing, and Tommy is distracted. 
TOMMY 
Is he allowed to do that? Turkish is drinking milk from a bottle 
TURKISH 
It's an unlicensed boxing match Tommy, not a tickling competition. These lads are out to hurt each other. 
GORGEOUS GEORGE 
Oi Turkish, can I have a drink? Turkish looks over his shoulder and then points to himself v 
(CONTINUED) 
8   CONTINUED: 
TURKISH 
What do I look like to you George, a fuckin water boy? Turkish looks at the WATER BOY. 
TURKISH (CONT'D) 
Oi son, look lively. 
He turns .back to Tommy. 
TURKISH (CONT'D) 
Look at it. 
He turns to see the remnants of a caravan where they keep the training gear and administration for the fights 
TURKISH (CONT'D) 
How am I supposed to run this thing from that? We gonna need a proper office. He looks at the caravan again and sighs, it is quite pitiful 
TURKISH (CONT'D) 
I want a new one Tommy and you 're going to buy it for me. 
TOMMY 
What's wrong with this one? Turning back to Tommy and ascending the steps in to his "I have seen better days" caravan, TURKISH'S foot goes through one of the stairs and the.door comes off at the hinges as he tries to open it. 
TURKISH 
Oh nothing Tommy, it's tip top, it's just I am not sure about the colour. He passes him a piece of paper 
TURKISH (CONT'D) 
Here it's all arranged. You just gotta pick it up. Here's an address. Tommy looks at the address and frowns. 
TOMMY 
I t ' s that campsite. 
TURKISH 
That's right, you're buying a caravan, caravans live in campsites. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED:   (2). 
TOMMY 
They aren't pikey are they? 
TURKISH 
I don't know what they are, all I know is they have a caravan, and we want a Caravan. 
TOMMY 
I hope they're not pikies.     I hate fucking pikies. 
HANDS 
He isn't selling poop. 
DOUG 
Listen if the stones are kosher then I'll by em. Now I gotta business, to run. He puts the phone down. 
(CONTINUED) 
11   CONTINUED: 
DOUG (CONT'D) 
That was my cousin Hands, Have I told you about my cousin Hands? 
ALEX 
Yes Dad, you have. 
DOUG 
He's an important fella. 
SUSI,   .        . 
Yes Dad, you told us. 
ALE X 
Is that a prawn sandwich you're eating? Doug looks mildly embarrassed 
DOUG 
Is it? 
ALEX 
You're Jewish Dad. 
DOUG 
Yes.     I was last time·I looked. 
ALEX 
Well you can't eat shell fish, Dad, i t ' s against your persuasion. 
DOUG 
What persuasion myself or the prawns belongs to is not the issue, the issue is how a fuckin shrimp managed to sneak in to' my sandwich. Pause. 
DOUG (CONT'D) 
Sneaky bastards. 
He throws the half eaten sandwich out the window. 
12   EXT. STREET OUTSIDE BOOKIES -- DAY 
We cut to an enormous and frightening looking dog sniffing the half eaten prawn sandwich, before he is yanked away by his master. The dog is a lively young thing. We raise the camera to see the man that is walking it. Meet VINNY. Vinny is a very large black man - the size is due to dumplings not dumbbells. He .stops outside a shop. We see it clearly. I t ' s a pawnbrokers. 
(CONTINUED) 
12   CONTINUED: 
VINNY 
Move it, come on move" i t . Vinny enters the pawn shop. 
13   INT. PAWN BROKERS -- DAY 
Meet SOL, who's behind the counter, Vinny's partner in the pawn shop. He's concentrating on the deal at hand with BAD BOY LINCOLN and has a stone-inspecting monocle to his eye. 
VINNY 
Alright Sol, Lincoln. They are in deep discussion and only Lincoln responds. 
B AD BOY LINCOLN 
Vin. 
SOL 
It's a mosinite. 
BAD BOY LINCOLN 
A whatinnite? 
SOL 
No, a mosinite. 
BAD BOY LINCOLN 
How much a night? 
SOL 
No, a fuckin mosinite.            It's the updated zirconia. 
BAD BOY LINCOLN 
Enough of bosinites and mosonias, talk English to me Sol? 
SOL 
Zirconias are artificial diamonds, they look pretty good to the novice like you Lincoln. But you could break them with a hammer, so they came up with mosinites. 
BAD BOY LINCOLN 
What are you saying? 
SOL 
I am saying it's worth fuck all. Lincoln's face drops 
(CONTINUED) 
13   CONTINUED: 
BAD BOY LINCOLN 
What are we doing here? 
TOMMY 
We are buying a caravan. 
GORGEOUS GEORGE 
Off a pack of fucking pikies? What's wrong with you? This'll get messy. 
TOMMY 
Not if you're here. 
GORGE OUS GEORGE 
Oh fuck off Tommy you never said anything about pikies. 
TOMMY 
Calm down, we are buying and then we are off. 
GORGEOUS GEORGE 
Oh you bastard, I hate fuckin pikies. They arrive in the camp site and the car is immediately surrounded by KIDS. The kids (most of whom are on bikes) speak with a sort of Anglo-Irish mix that sounds as rough as the kids look.         , 
KID 1 
That's a flash car Mister. 
TOMMY 
Not as flash as your bike though is it? 
KID 1 
Who you looking for? 
TOMMY 
Mr O'Neill. 
KID 1 
Do you want me to go and get him? 
TOMMY 
Good lad. 
(CONTINUED) 
14   CONTINUED: (2_)                . 
There is a pause, the boy doesn't move. 
TOMMY (CONT'D) 
Well are you going to go and get him? 
KID 1 
Yeah. There is another pause. 
TOMMY 
Well what are you waiting for? 
KID 1 
The five quid you are going to pay me. Chuckling. 
TOMMY 
Oh fuck off, I'll find him myself. 
KID 1 
Two fifty. 
TOMMY 
You can have a quid. 
KID 1 
Oh you're a tight fucker aren't ya? A man shouts from the background. He's a young fella with a hard but friendly face (when he smiles). He's covered in grease and facial hair, and his trousers are done up with string. But he's wearing a Cartier watch and Gucci shoes, and a large gold identity bracelet. This is MICKY O'NEILL. 
MIC KY 
What are you doing Paul? Get out of the way boy. Are you Tommy, have you come about the caravan? 
TOMMY 
Mr O'Neill? 
MICKY 
Fuck man, call me Micky. Micky comes up to the car, cleaning his grease covered hands with a hand towel. 
TOMMY 
How are ya? 
(CONTINUED) 
14   CONTINUED: ( 3 ) 
MICKY 
I am well sir, well, quite well, the weather is being kind to us but the engines aren't. 
Gorgeous George steps out of the car.      Micky takes a step back. 
MICKY (CONT'D) 
Fuck me, would you look at the size of him, Jesus man how big are you? Hey kids how fucking big is he? 
KID 2 
He's a big man that's for sure. 
MICKY 
The are psychological advantages to a gun that looks like it can perforate the moon. 
(CONTINUED) 
15   CONTINUED: ( ? ) 
Tyrone gets into the car, starts it up again and puts some money in the car wash machine. 
SOL 
Can you get this fuckin dog to stop dribbling on me? Vin pulls the dog back. 
SOL (CONT'D) 
I worry about you Vin, Jesus, talk about overkill. One look at a crack desperate brother and you could wave a knife and fork around, and I am sure they would lick the salt of your scrotum. The car wash starts. 
VINNY 
What the fuck are you doing? 
TYRONE 
I never do a job unless I have a clean car, I like to make my wheels look crisp. 
VINNY 
Are you serious,? You' re a getaway driver, you're not here to show your fuckin car off.               ··. The machine starts. They do the windows up and that point the dog lets out a fart. The water starts to hit the windshield so they can't undo the windows. There is more an atmosphere of disbelief than of concrete anger. 
16   EXT. CARAVAN CAMP SITE 
Gorgeous George fastens the caravan to the back of their Land Rover and pulls away. They wave at Micky and he reciprocates. 
MICKY 
He's a good dog. He'll get a little homesick for a while but he'11 get over it. Tommy has a dog that looks distressed about leaving Micky sitting next to him. 
17   INT. CAR -- DAY 
TOMMY 
I don't know what all your fuss was about. They aren't bad fellas. Just then the wheels of the caravan come straight off and the caravan is dragged until the car comes to a sudden stop. The dog jumps out the window and goes bounding back to the campsite. 
18   EXT. CARAVAN -- DAY 
They are looking at the damage.   Of course i t ' s completely useless now. 
. GORGEOUS GEORGE 
I don't think it's supposed to have done that. 
19   EXT. CARAVAN CAMP SITE -- DAY 
The dog is behind Micky's legs happy to be back. 
MICKY 
The deal was you bought it how you saw it. Tommy goes to interrupt but he doesn't get a chance 
MICKY (CONT'D) 
Look, I have helped ya as much as I am gonna help ya. You still got a car and I suggest you use it before you're not welcome anymore. There is a silence for a while. The atmosphere has gone more than frosty and a few more gypsies are hanging around. 
GORGEOUS GEORGE 
Hey... Interrupted 
MICKY 
It was only a question of time before you got some attention. Nobody brings a fella the size of you unless they are trying to say something without talking. 
TOMMY 
Just give us my money and you can keep your caravan. 
(CONTINUED) 
19   CONTINUED: 
MICKY 
Why the fuck do I want a caravan that's got no fuckin wheels? I am not going to do that. 
Gorgeous George steps forward. 
MICKY (CONT'D) 
Where the fuck do you think you're going? You want to settle this with a fight? 
MUM 
You'll do no such thing Michael. You'll... 
MICKY 
Alright Mum, we shan't, we'll settle it some other way, now don't get upset. 
MUM 
I won't have you fighting, Micky. Micky's Mum is getting upset and it's consequently upsetting Micky. 
MICKY 
Okay mum okay. You need to sit down. Micky calls to one of the lads standing by. 
MICKY (CONT'D) 
Darren look after Mum. Get her sitting down. We see Mum being led out by Darren; Micky looks genuinely concerned for his mum. Pause as Micky waits for her to be well gone. 
MICKY (CONT'D) 
I ' l l fight you for it. 
Tommy looks at Gorgeous George.        Gorgeous George raises his eyebrows. 
20   INT. HORSE BOX, PIKEY CAMP -- DAY 
The two fighters start pacing. It looks a bit ridiculous, Micky is dwarfed by comparison. Gorgeous George takes a swipe: it was an .impressive punch, but Micky is a quick littl bastard and sidesteps. Micky does nothing to retaliate; his hands are still by his,side. 
(CONTINUED) 
20   CONTINUED: 
Gorgeous George lunges out and grabs Micky by the throat and groin, picks him up like a sack of spuds and throws him against the car door. All eyes are on Micky for a second or two, then he rises and appears little bothered by this, he gets up brushes himself off and starts to pace again, hardly even looking at the big man. 
TURKISH (CONT'D) 
Jesus! 
TOMMY 
What? 
TURKISH 
Let's use the fuckin pikey. 
22   INT. DOUG'S OFFICE -- DAY 
Doug the Head and Franky Four Fingers are doing a deal. Doug has a case open and is admiring a couple of stones. 
FRANKY FOUR FINGERS 
From Russia with love. You interested?                                . 
DOUG 
I told you I was interested. Pause.   Franky's in a rush. 
FRANKY FOUR FINGERS 
I got stones to sell, fat to chew and many different men to see about many different dogs, so if I am not rushing you, could you spit shine the top of your smoothie and move a little faster? 
DOUG 
Hold tight Franky, when in Rome. 
FRANKY FOUR FINGERS 
I am not in Rome Doug, I am in a rush. He looks at his watch 
FRANKY FOUR FINGERS (CONT'D) 
I gotta make the bookies. 
DOUG 
Bookies? What you betting on? 
(CONTINUED) 
22   CONTINUED: 
FRANKY FOUR FINGERS 
Some guy called Bomber Harris. 
DOUG 
The unlicensed boxer? You know something I don't? 
FRANKY FOUR FINGERS 
Maybe. Doug raises his eyebrows 
DOUG 
You get busy Franky. Put a couple of hundred down for me. 
23   INT. PIKEY ENCAMPMENT -- DAY 
TURKISH 
What do you say? 
MICKY 
How much you going to pay us? 
TOMMY 
Ten k. 
MICKY 
I lose more than that running for the bus. I ' l l do it for a caravan. 
TURKISH 
A what? 
MICKY 
No a caravan. 
TOMMY 
A what? 
M ICKY 
You are sitting in one if that makes things easier. I want a top caravan. 
TOMMY 
It was us that wanted a caravan.- Anyway what's wrong with this one? 
MICKY 
It's not for me, it ' s for me Mum.

BRICK TOP 
Look mean now you hairy fucker won't ya? He looks at the appalled faces of Turkish and Tommy. 
BRICK TOP (CONT'D) 
Shits itself when you put it in the ring, but poke .it with a stick and watch his bollocks grow. You like a dog fight, Turkish? 
TURKISH 
I like my dog to growl at the post man. 
BRICK TOP 
Gorgeous ready for tonight? 
TURKISH 
We don'c have a Gorgeous anymore. Brick Top turns round and indicates that he would like the noise around him to drop. It does marginally. 
BRICK TOP 
You're going to have to repeat that. 
TURKISH 
We have lost Gorgeous George. Brick Top turns round again at the already subdued crowd, he doesn't raise his voice but the crowd reacts. 
BRICK TOP 
I said keep the noise down.. . . A tangible silence between the men reflects Brick Top's authority. 
BRICK TOP (CONT'D) 
Well, where did you lose him? He isn't a set of fuckin car keys is he? And it's not as though he is inconfuckinspicuous is it? 
TURKISH 
I am not backing out. 
BRICK TOP 
You can bet your bollocks to a barn dance you're not backing out. 
(CONTINUED) 
27   CONTINUED: .(2) 
TOMMY 
We are changing the fighter. Brick Top wasn't expecting anything out of Tommy. 
BRICK TOP 
Oh fuck me your lady friend has got a voice. And who might you be changing him to, sweetheart? 
TURKISH 
You won't know him. Pause: a look of you're kidding comes over his face. 
BRICK TOP 
Are you taking the piss? 
TURKISH 
No, there was an accident. 
BRICK TOP 
I'll show you a fuckin accident. 
TURKISH 
You've still got your fight. 
BRICK TOP 
No, I lose all bets at the bookies. You can't change fighters at the last minute, so no, I don't have my fight do I, you fuckin prat! 
TOMMY 
You could take bets at the fight. 
BRICK TOP 
Put a lead on her Turkish,     Before she gets bitten. Pause 
BRICK TOP (CONT'D) 
Make sure your man goes down in the fourth. You're on thin fuckin ice my pedigree chums and I'll be there if it breaks.

SOL 
I am not happy about that dog Vin, you can't bring a dog on a job. 
VINNY 
You can't leave him on his own, not to begin with, he gets homesick. 
SOL 
Homesick, for fucks sake. 
VINNY 
He does. If he gets the chance he runs back to the gypsies' campsite. 
SOL 
Ohh shut up, how can he find it? 
Tyrone get us outta here. Tyrone takes an interest in the man from the van (ie Franky) seeing that he's carrying a case and the case is connected to his wrist. 
SOL (CONT'D) 
I said, get us outta here Tyrone! 
35   EXT. CAESARS PALACE STREATHAM 
The Aston Martin comes to a screeching halt outside. Doug is quite pale from the ride. Hands looks almost satisfied with the car. 
HANDS

HANDS (CONT'D) 
Caesar's Palace? 
36   INT. CAESARS PALACE STREATHAM 
Doug approaches the entrance. 
DOORMAN 
Private night tonight chaps. Doug passes him a ticket. The doorman steps to the side. They continue to walk past several other doorman who all inspect the ticket. 
HANDS 
Jesus are we ever going to get in there? 
DOUG 
You gotta understand that this isn't exactly Vegas and it's not exactly legal. 
HANDS 
I am not looking for Vegas, Doug, I am looking for Franky Four Fingers.

If there's gambling involved, he'll be here. They get nudged aside by an entourage of men coming through. 
HANDS (CONT'D) 
Hello, who's your man? Hands points out Brick Top who is being crowded by minders. 
DOUG 
Horrible bastard, it's his fight, made all his money in. 
He touches the side of his nose and inhales. 
HANDS 
Original. 
DOUG 
So he doesn't need to do this, but he's got dark taste for fights and blood, he wants to impress London's criminal royalty.. He points out JACK "THE ALL SEEING EYE" and SALT PETER: they are surrounded by heavies. 
DOUG (CONT'D) 
..with a tip on when who hits the floor. Any man with veins in his brains knows Brick Top knows the answer. Cut back to Jack and Salt Pete.

REF           .'· 
In the blue corner I have the young and only unchallenged cutthroat of calamity, meaner than Beelzebub's conscience cleaner. Give it up for the bone crunching one punch machine gun -- Micky. A murky sound of displeasure emanates round the arena.         The audience don't know who he is and don't care either. 
R EF (CONT'D) 
And in the other corner a man that needs no introduction to destruction, the solo warrior of Walthamstow, sometimes known as Buckshot Peter, or sometimes known as the dictator . to the devastator, he put the ' e ' in eradicate, the ' o ' in obliterate and the ' a 1 in annihilate, you know this monster of a monster, the sinister prime minister.. . . "Bomber the "mad man" Harris"! The audience goes mad. It's hard to tell whether it's out of affectionate enthusiasm or just enthusiasm. 
R EF (CONT'D) 
Now I want a good dirty fight lads, So now it's that time again.. . . Let's. . . . Get ready to rrrrrrummmmmble. The two come out to fight. Bomber Harris lifts his monster hands to do damage. They pace each other for a second. Then Micky lets one go.                 <

37   CONTINUED: 
It hits Bomber Harris square on the jaw this has the effect of forcing blood out of his ears the man is positively out cold. We crashtrack into various characters' reactions: Brick Top, Turkish and Tommy etc. All are in shock. The ref (who is obviously paid off as well) tries to resuscitate Harris/ but it's not happening, he catches a look of desperation from one of the villains and is eventually left with little choice but to hold Micky's hand up. We cut to the nasty looking characters that we saw before they have approached with their heavies, and they are obviously not satisfied.            . 
SALT PETER 
Tha-nks for the tip, Brick top. 
Boris pulls out a wad of notes 
BORIS 
There's ten grand. 
VINNY 
Keep it. We want this, or at least half of this. 
Vin holds up the stone: the atmosphere changes. 
BORIS 
What was in the case was mine, what was in the bookies was yours, ok there wasn't much but, here's ten large to help the situation. 
VINNY 
I am afraid it's too late for that Boris.                  - He holds up the diamond. Boris1 eyes follow him as he walks back into the room where Franky is and puts the diamond back into the case while he's talking and changes the combination. 
VINNY (CONT'D) 
We want half and that's because we are being generous. We could by rights keep the whole fuckin stone. Boris grimaces and pulls out a gun from god knows where, and within a second shoots poor Franky in the face. Franky's body disappears off the stool that he was sitting on. The black guys are stunned into silence. 
BORIS 
You fuckin idiots. He couldn't know who I am. Now open the case and give me.the stone. The black guys are left with their mouths open, everything just changed gear and they weren't expecting that. 
BORIS (CONT'D) 
Who's next? You have the ten grand now give me the stone. The pause continues. Boris lets a shot off that tears worryingly close to Sol's head. 
(CONTINUED) 
42   CONTINUED:   (2.) 
SOL 
The only man that knows the combination you just shot. Boris appears little bothered by this and whips out a four foot machete that he was concealing about his person. He pulls the case towards him and brings the machete down with full force. We can tell by the expression on Tyrone's face that it must have been some part of Franky's anatomy. Pointing to the ground: 
BORIS 
He's your problem now. You can keep the" ten grand along with the body, but if I see you again...well look at him. He points to Franky. While he is saying this he bends down and picks up the case from the floor and wraps the severed arm in newspaper. He then walks out of the shop casual as you like. 
43   EXT. AMUSEMENT ARCADE LONDON -- MORNING 
Turkish pulls up outside his arcade and has a look around: all seems to be clear. 
TURKISH 
I ain't going in the front. 
TOMMY 
I don't think it's a good idea you going in at all. The car surges off round the back. 
TURKISH 
Unless you are going to transcendentally extract the passports and cash from out of a steel safe, I can't see any other way of getting them. Keep your eyes peeled. Turkish has another look around the back 
TURKISH (CONT'D) 
Well I can't see anyone. After I have got in go round the front and call me if you see anything. 
44   INT. AMUSEMENT ARCADE 
Turkish lets himself in and walks through.        Everything seems to be fine.     · 
(CONTINUED) 
44   CONTINUED: 
He walks into his office, has a quick look around and makes his way to the safe under the floor. He decides to put the kettle on, does so, and his attention is caught by something, he looks at the cups on the side and sees that one is waiting to be made. He stands back and looks at the cupboards he sees that they are all open. Then he sees that the kettle is already boiled. 
ERROL 
Oink, oink.    Where do you keep the sugar? 
TURKISH 
Shit you scared the life outta me. 
JOHN 
You wait till you see what the pigs do to you. 
TURKISH 
What brings you two here, run out of pants to sniff? 
ERROL 
That's very good Turkish. 
JOHN 
Very cool Turkish. 
TURKISH 
Well what do you want? 
EROL 
I want two sugars in my tea.       What do you want John? 
JOHN 
I want to see him lying cold and still, but we aren't here for what we want are we Errol? Errol shakes his head slowly.       Turkish's phone rings.   They let it ring for a while. 
ERROL 
Well aren't you going to answer it? Turkish does. 
45   EXT. AMUSEMENT ARCADE LONDON -- MORNING 
Tommy on the phone.

TOMMY 
TONY (CONT'D) 
Oh you silly cunt. Tony stands and walks towards Charlie. Charlie is understandably shocked and fires another. It goes straight through Tony and we see the blood hit the wall behind. 
CHARLIE 
Go down-boy, go down. 
(CONTINUED) 
47   CONTINUED: 
Tony keeps going for him. Charlie raises the gun and points it at Tony's face and fires the last shot. The bullet goes straight into his mouth but it went in at an angle and it exits his cheek. Tony is standing there with six. bullet holes in him and bleeding all over the carpet. As he talks blood courses its way down his front and a strong lisp is frustrating the words. 
TONY 
Ohh you'f in twouble nowf. 
Tony slowly extracts a short sword from behind him. Fear has set into Charlie's face and has rendered him useless.

They, have only made forty this year. You could find the maker of this engine's signature on the engine. But you can't find me Franky. 
DOUG 
No it's true. I can't find'him, but I know a man that can. Cut to a shot of Hands encouraging him to continue. 
DOUG (CONT'D) 
Tony. Bullet Tooth Tony.     He'll find Franky for you. 
HANDS 
Who's he? Susi interrupts. 
SUSI

DOUG 
He's the best chance you have of finding Franky.

SUSI 
He has upset every bad boy in town, at some point, or another but nobody's got the nuts to knock him off because they aren't sure whether you can kill the bastard. 
HANDS 
You really think he can find him? 
SUSI 
He'll find you Moses and the burning bush if you pay him to. 
HANDS 
Ok so let's get hold of him. 
DOUG 
Firstly you gotta understand he's a little strange.                                       . 
HANDS 
.He could swing from trees wearing rubber dresses as far as I am concerned, all as I care about is whether he can find Franky. 
49   INT. CARAVAN CAMP SITE --DAY 
Turkish and Tommy pull up outside the pikey camp.             Micky's Mum is sitting in her chair surrounded by kids. 
MUM 
They're very nice Tommy.       Thank you. Tommy has produced a bunch of flowers from somewhere.              Turkish finds this a great surprise. 
TURKISH 
Where did they come from? You're a snake in the grass Tommy. 
MUM 
You looking for Micky? 
TURKISH

TURKISH 
Well do you want to do it? 
MICKY 
That depends. 
TURKISH 
On what? 
MICKY 
On you buying this caravan. He pulls out a catalogue on fancy caravans and points to the picture of the Rolls Royce of caravans. 
TURKISH 
That's not the same caravan. 
MICKY 
This isn't the same fight.

I t ' s twice the fuckin size of the last one. 
MICKY 
The fight is twice the size. And my mum still needs a new caravan. 
TURKISH 
Micky you are lucky we aren't worm food after your performance, I think buying a tart's mobile palace is a little fuckin rich. 
There is a pause while Micky frowns.       Turkish looks a little sheepish. 
TURKISH (CONT'D) 
I didn't mean that your mum was a tart. I just meant... 
MICKY 
Save your breath for cooling your porridge. I'll bet you for it. 
TURKISH 
What like Tommy did last time? Do me a favour? 
MICKY 
I ' l l do you a favour, you have first     , bet. If I win I get the caravan, if I lose I'l l do the fight for free. Turkish considers this, uneasily.       He looks at the dogs they look keen and fit. 
TURKISH 
Okay, I reckon the hare gets caught. But he's in. Gypsy Romany Music starts. Cut to slow motion, CU of dogs' enthusiasm, CU of pikeys and their fingers skillfully dealing in money, inhaling cigarettes, etc.

They bail Tyrone out of the car and into Brick Top's pub. Brick Top is waiting there. Brick Top asks questions. We can't hear what he's asking, but we can see that Tyrone isn't playing the game. 
62   EXT. FIELD 
The dogs are moving in. 
63   INT. DOG HOUSE 
A door is opened and Tyrone is thrown in. A rabid Neapolitan mastiff pitbull hybrid that is attached to the end of a long pole with a lasso at the other end is brought in, it will quite clearly savage anything in its way.

The hare gets caught and a pile of fur comes up

The hare escapes the jaws of the dogs and is off. 
Are' you taking the piss again? 
TURKISH 
That's what he said, she's a nice old girl his mum. 
BRICK TOP 
You're on thin ice Turkish, and I am going to be there when it breaks. He puts the phone down and inhales. 
BRICK TOP (CONT'D) 
Anything for an easy life. That fuckin pikey being difficult. Hello, we here? 
71   EXT. PAWN BROKERS 
We see Errol outside with a glass cutter. He puts it around the door and creates a circle with the sharp side, pulls it out and puts his hand through to kill the alarm. He's in.

72   INT. BACK ROOM PORN BROKERS 
Vin, Lincoln and Sol are arguing 
SOL 
Hold him by his legs. 
BA D BOY LINCOLN 
What do you think I am holding him by, his fucking ears? The interconnecting door opens slowly. 
BRICK TOP 
Hope it ' s not a bad moment. Sol looks at Vin, Vin looks at Lincoln: they are understandably surprised. Brick Top looks around the room the silence continues. Brick Top helps himself to the most comfortable seat. 
BRICK TOP (CONT'D) 
Do you know who I am? 
BAD BOY LINCOLN 
Yeah I know. 
BRICK TOP 
Good.   That will save me some time then. 
VINNY 
Well I don't. 
BRICK TOP 
What you gonna do with your man there? You're always gonna have problems lifting a body in one piece. Apparently the best thing to do is cut the corpse up into six pieces and pile it all together. 
(CONTINUED) 
72   CONTINUED: 
SOL 
Would someone mind telling me who you are? 
BRICK TOP 
After you got six pieces you gotta get rid of 'em, of course you can't just leave it in the deep freeze for your mum to discover, can ya? Pause while the black guys are still holding the body. The door opens and in walks Errol. He passes Brick Top a cup of tea in a take away container. 
VINNY 
Lincoln, who is this man? 
BRICK TOP 
And then I hear the best thing to do is feed 'em to pigs. You gotta starve the pigs for a few days, then the sight of a chopped up body looks like curry to a drunk. You gotta shave the heads of your victims and pull the teeth out, you could do that after of course, but you don't want to go sieving pig shit do you? Ever seen the size of one of their molars?                                        · 
He holds up his fist 
BRICK TOP (CONT'D) 
They go through bone like i t ' s butter. You gotta have a few pigs though you need about sixteen they will go through a body that weighs two hundred pounds in about eight minutes that means that a single pig can consume two pounds of uncooked flesh every minute,. . . Pause

81   EXT. CARAVAN CAMP SITE 
Micky is looking at his caravan; it's in flames, real proper roaring flames. People are desperately trying to put the flames out. Micky is covered in dirt from his futile efforts. One of the other pikies who's involved in trying to extinguish the fire turns round and sees Micky standing there motionless. He can see he's upset. 
PATRICK 
What's wrong with Micky? 
DAREN 
His mam was in there Patrick.   They burnt his mam. All real sound recedes and we drift in to music. The camera slowly tracks in on Micky. It's hard to read how devastated he is. The camera reaches Micky's face, the reflections of the flames can be seen in his water swollen eyes, but his cheeks remain dry.         . 
82   INT. BTT CAR 
BTT is driving, Hands in the passenger seat and Rose Bud in the back. BTT's got a bleeding eye and his hand is wrapped up in a bandage. Rose Bud is clutching his stomach.

VINNY 
Do you know where he keeps em? They find the right key. 
SOL 
Well they ain't gonna be lying on the kitchen table Vince, we gotta have to look. Flick tlie switch. I t ' s dark, they flick the switch. They look onto an immaculate pad. Music fades up along with the lights.

Milk, in these cartons. i

Why, what's wrong with it? 
TOMMY 
It's not in synch with evolution. 
TURKISH 
Shut up! 
T OMMY 
Cows have only been domesticated in the last eight thousand years, before that they were running around mad as lorries. The human digestive system '"' hasn't got used to any dairy products yet, it takes a lot longer than that.

TOMMY 
Here let me do you a favour. He reaches over and grabs the carton from Turkish, and throws it out the window. The milk obviously hits an on-coming car . in the other direction. There is a terrible crashing noise. Tommy and Turkish come to a standstill, and look back to see a small pile up on the other side of the road.

SOL 
You alright Lincoln? 
ERROL 
Do you know why the governor is the governor? 
VINNY 
Err. . 
ERROL 
I t 's because people are scared of him. You know why they are scared of him? 
SOL 
Err . 
ERROL 
It's because of stories. I am sure you've heard one or two of those stories. For example, did you hear about the three black fellas that did a very bad thing, however they made some effort to redeem that very bad thing, so the governor saw fit not to kill em. He thought it would be a more advantageous concept to let them kill each other and let the survivor live to tell the tale. That way everybody wins, well, all except the two that died of course. We look at the table where we see three large kitchen knives sitting provocatively. Tyrone rushes for one of the blades grabs it and runs at Vin, Vin sidesteps and Tyrone keeps running straight into the arms of Errol who raises his gun at the last moment. Tyrone slides the blade into Errol 's ribs and Errol fires a shot straight at Tyrone. The bullet passes through Tyrone and hits John in the throat . Vin, Lincoln and Sol are left wondering what the fuck has just happened .

He's pissed in my fuckin pocket, look! Ken shows off a wet-sided jacket and a damp set of trousers. 
BRICK TOP 
Do shut up Ken.   That was a bit naughty Tony. Tony shrugs. Brick Top puts his hands in to his pocket and withdraws the stone. We cut to Hand's expression. 
HANDS 
Well come on, let's have a look. Brick Top passes the stone to Hands. All goes quiet while everybody focuses on the stone. Hands lifts it up to his eye.

We are nearly there. They are a horrible bunch this lot Micky so pay attention to what you are doing. Micky just yawns. 
TURKISH (CONT'D) 
Put up some kind of a show, he's a hard bastard this "good night" Anderson so don't get too clever, he used to be a pro. Just keep moving round the ring, and let the odd one go when push has come to shove. 
MICKY 
Let's get on with it, shall we? 
118   INT. WAREHOUSE                                -    ' 
A temporary ring has   been erected, four scaffolding posts with welded on hoops   make the arena, the ropes that are threaded through the   hoops are industrial nylon and free of padding. Around the    ropes it's starting to fill. Brick Top approaches Salt Pete   and Jack 'the all seeing eye'. 
We are outta here. They come out of a side entrance, their car pulls round the corner and screeches to a halt. Brick Top opens the door as he is about to get in, he's eyes widen to the size of saucers as FOUR MEN (who we recognize from the wake) are sitting in the place of his driver. They both have sawed-off shotguns and empty four barrels into the chest of Brick Top and Ken. The car spins away, leaving their twitching bodies on the dirt.

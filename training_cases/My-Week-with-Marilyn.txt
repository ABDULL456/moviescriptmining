1 EXT. TILBURY DOCKS. DAY. 1 
Over a DARK SCREEN we see the caption: "This is a fairy story, an episode out of time and space, which nevertheless was real" - Colin Clark. Then, FADE UP ON: Newsreel footage of SIR LAURENCE OLIVIER AND VIVIEN LEIGH arriving back at Tilbury Docks to be greeted by an excited crowd of fans. As they progress down the gangplank and stop to sign autographs we HEAR an excited commentary OVER: 
COMMENTATOR "Returning to England are Britain's acting royalty Sir Laurence Olivier and Lady Olivier, better known as stunning Gone With The Wind star Vivien Leigh. Sir Laurence has added a new string to his bow with the announcement that he is to direct and star in a screen version of Terence Rattigan's stage play The Sleeping Prince with none other than Hollywood siren Marilyn Monroe. When the world's greatest actor romances the most famous woman alive, we can be sure that sparks will fly. Now, now Lady Olivier, don't worry - any romance is strictly for the camera!" As OLIVIER and VIVIEN smile for the photographers, we -

2 EXT. SALTWOOD CASTLE. DAY. 2 
It is 1956. Saltwood Castle, the family home of the Clark family, looms over the landscape, framed by the setting sun. It is majestic, an Englishman's dream of a home, complete with turrets and even a moat. There is a feeling of timeless beauty and stability about the scene, something profoundly English. We are a very long way from Hollywood.

3 EXT. SALTWOOD CASTLE. GARDEN. DAY. 3 
COLIN CLARK, 23, hurries across the lawn carrying a bag, he is casually dressed, boyish and handsome. He heads towards a beautiful, ramshackle building and through the ancient oak doors. 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 2. 
3A INT. SALTWOOD CASTLE. LIBRARY STAIRS. DAY. 3A 
COLIN bounds up the stairs into the Library. 
3B INT. SALTWOOD CASTLE. LIBRARY. DAY. 3B 
As COLIN enters, he sees SIR KENNETH CLARK, standing in front of a painting on an easel by the Italian Baroque painter, Annibale Carracci. He has two STUDENTS with him, a man and a woman in their early 20s, and is in mid-description of the painting. 
KENNETH ... and this is one of Carracci's earlier works and one is able to see the emergence of his now famous Baroque style, which is clearly rooted in the tradition of high renaissance and antiquity... COLIN pauses briefly and hurries towards them. Throughout the scene there is a sense of his urgency and desire to go. The whole thing should be played at breakneck pace. KENNETH beams affectionately. 
KENNETH Colin! Come in. Have you met James and Anna? Two very brilliant pupils. He has the avuncular air of a benign academic, affable and a little eccentric. COLIN smiles hurriedly at the students, no time to waste. 
COLIN I'm leaving for London now, Pa. 
KENNETH Ah, yes. Well, bon chance, dear boy... He puts a friendly arm around COLIN's shoulder and starts to walk him back to the door. 
KENNETH I can always get you a research position at the V&A when you've grown up a bit and got this film idea out of your system... COLIN's smiles but before he can reply JANE CLARK whirls into the room, a ball of energy, talking nineteen to the dozen. 
JANE Kenneth, you might have told Cook we were another two for dinner. What is everyone supposed to eat? Cabbage soup? Oh, Colin, darling, there you are... 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 2A. 
She looks wonderful in a good quality but elderly dress, eccentrically combined with gardening attire, her mind on a dozen things at once. 
COLIN I'm off now, Mama. 
JANE Off? 
COLIN My job interview, remember..? But she is already continuing her journey. COLIN smiles hurriedly at KENNETH, who gives him an affectionate wave as COLIN dashes after his mother. She leaves the Library. 
CUT TO: 
3C INT. SALTWOOD CASTLE. GARDEN. DAY. 3C 
JANE strides across the lawn with COLIN rushing to catch up. 
JANE Can't you stay for dinner? There's nothing to eat but I'm sure the conversation will be charming. 
COLIN I don't want to be late in the morning. As COLIN hurries after JANE he is nearly run down by an elderly GARDENER with a lawn mower, and has to take lightning evasive action. JANE doesn't notice. 
JANE I'm sure they won't mind. You'll be a famous film director in no time. I know your father's put in a word. 
COLIN I wish he hadn't done that. I can manage on my own. She stops so abruptly he nearly slams into her. JANE looks around the garden with a frown. 
JANE I have to watch Jenkins like a hawk. One more of his murderous prunings and we'll lose the tea roses for ever. And she's off again, with COLIN still following. He can't help smiling at the madness of it all.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 2B. 
4 EXT. SALTWOOD CASTLE. DRIVEWAY. DAY. 4 
The sun is setting, casting a golden glow over the castle. COLIN and JANE emerge from the front door, COLIN pauses in the driveway and dumps his bag in the back of his old but racy MG Sports car. Only now does JANE really turn her attention fully to him for the first time. 
JANE Now go and have a lovely time, darling. We're always here when you're ready to talk your future. COLIN wants to protest but before he can get the words out JANE sees a YOUNG GARDENER walking at the side of the house with a wheel barrow. Her face lights up. 
JANE Mullins! Be an angel - find Cook and ask her how many pork chops we need for tonight. Then bring the car round. I must get to the village before the shop shuts... She dashes away after the GARDENER, turning back as an afterthought to blow a kiss at COLIN as she goes. COLIN smiles, then pauses for a moment to look at the house. We can sense both his affection for it but more pressingly his need to get away. He gets in, puts the car in gear and the Bristol pulls out of the drive and across the moat. In the last rays of the sun, the countryside looks magical, but Colin only has eyes for the road ahead. 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 3. 
5 EXT. LONDON STREETS MONTAGE. EVENING 5 
It is now nearly 6 o'clock. COLIN sits exactly as he was. PERCEVAL shares a look with VANESSA as he comes out of his office. He gazes drily at Colin. 
PERCEVAL There are no jobs. 
COLIN I'll come back tomorrow morning. Just in case. 
PERCEVAL It's a free country. He sounds as though he rather regrets it. 
11A EXT. 144 PICCADILLY. LONDON. DAY. (MONTAGE) 11A 
COLIN arrives early, ready for another day. 
12 INT. 144 PICCADILLY. RECEPTION AREA. DAY. (MONTAGE) 12 
COLIN is back in his place at 8.30 sharp the next morning. PERCEVAL gives him a grim stare as he goes through to his office. VANESSA glances up from her typewriter. He meets her eye optimistically but she ignores him. 
13 INT. 144 PICCADILLY. RECEPTION AREA. DAY. 13 
The clock ticks around with agonising slowness to 11.00. VANESSA finally gives Colin a pitying look. 
VANESSA Are you going to sit there all day? 
COLIN If I have to. 
VANESSA You're very determined. 
COLIN I'd do anything to be in the film business. 
VANESSA Anything? 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 7. 
She smiles cheekily. He grins back, sensing an opportunity. 
VANESSA You can start by making me a cup of tea. White, two sugars.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 8. 
15 INT. 144 PICCADILLY. RECEPTION AREA. DAY. 15 
Close on the clock as it ticks around monotonously to 12.30. VANESSA puts on her gloves and collects her bag. She gives COLIN a sly look. 
VANESSA You can answer the telephone while I'm at lunch, if you like. She winks. COLIN grins. The phone rings. He picks it up. 
COLIN Laurence Olivier Productions... 
CALLER 
(ON PHONE) Is Sir Laurence there? 
COLIN He's at Notley until the end of the week. Can I take a message? 
CALLER 
(ON PHONE) I'll call back. No sooner has COLIN hung up than PERCEVAL appears. He stares at COLIN. 
COLIN Vanessa asked me to... 
PERCEVAL Oh, did she? Why didn't you put that call through? 
COLIN There didn't seem any need to bother you. But if you want me to transfer every single one... PERCEVAL looks at him grudgingly. 
PERCEVAL Use your judgement. He hesitates and looks back. 
PERCEVAL (CONT'D) I need a number for Noel Coward. It won't be in the book, so you'll have to track him down. COLIN realises this is a test. He thinks quickly.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 8A. 
16 INT. SALTWOOD CASTLE. HALL. DAY. 16 
The phone rings in the beautiful central hall. JANE CLARK picks up the phone. 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 9. 
COLIN 
(ON PHONE) Hello, Mama. 
JANE Colin, darling! How are you getting on? 
CUT BACK TO: 
The film shows Marilyn looking sweet and pretty, chatting silently to someone just off camera, mugging playfully in costume, larking about with her hair - and then, when she wants to, turning on her full film star wattage and looking wonderful, every inch the beautiful icon. It is an intimate glimpse of her at work. Colin watches, fascinated, completely forgetting why he's there, still holding the tray - 
PERCEVAL 
(TO CARDIFF) Larry says he particularly likes this dress. She looks radiant. 
CARDIFF Exactly - we need to tone her down a bit. 
PERCEVAL How the hell do you tone down Marilyn Monroe?! COLIN laughs. He immediately regrets it. Both men turn to look at him. PERCEVAL turns off the projector and gazes at him stonily. 
PERCEVAL Marilyn Monroe's publicist is flying in tomorrow. He wants to see the house she'll be staying in. Find something suitable. COLIN nods eagerly, anxious to get out. He is already at the door when PERCEVAL barks at him again. 
PERCEVAL And leave the bloody tea. COLIN had forgotten the tray. He blushes furiously, puts it down and hurries out. 
21 EXT. COUNTRY ROAD. DAY. 21 
COLIN has a map spread out on the bonnet of his Bristol sports car. He finds Pinewood Studios then draws a ring around its circumference. He taps his pencil thoughtfully as he lights a cigarette - one of the branded pack that Olivier gave him. He inhales deeply, thinking, then grimaces in distaste, quickly stubbing it out under his foot.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 13. 
22 EXT. TIBBS FARM. DRIVE. DAY. 22 
COLIN pulls into the drive of Tibbs Farm, a charming English cottage. 
CUT TO: 
23 EXT. TIBBS FARM. DAY. 23 
COTES-PREEDY, the owner, clearly has a very high opinion of Tibbs Farm. Aloof and snobbish, he stands by the front door, looking down his nose at COLIN. 
COTES-PREEDY Out of the question. I can't have a lot of awful film people tramping through the house in dirty boots. 
COLIN We'd pay a hundred pounds per week for 18 weeks. 
COTES-PREEDY My wife would never agree. 
COLIN That's a pity. I'll have to tell Miss Monroe to look elsewhere, then. COTES-PREEDY double takes. 
COTES-PREEDY Marilyn Monroe? 
COLIN 
(NODS) She's making a film with Sir Laurence Olivier. The Sleeping Prince. From the play by Terence Rattigan. 
COTES-PREEDY I saw it in the West End a couple of years ago. Vivien Leigh was marvellous. 
COLIN It's Marilyn Monroe in the film. COTES-PREEDY smiles transparently. 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 14. 
COTES-PREEDY (After a second) I suppose I'd have to be introduced..? 
CUT TO: 
24 DELETED 24 
25 EXT. 144 PICCADILLY. LONDON. DAY. 25 
ARTHUR JACOBS, Marilyn's publicist, is a close-cropped, pugnacious figure in his mid-forties. He waits impatiently outside Olivier's office, a stack of newspapers under his arm. COLIN comes hurrying up, smiling brightly. 
COLIN Good morning, Mr. Jacobs. I hope you had a pleasant flight. 
JACOBS Where's the fucking car? 
CUT TO: 
26 EXT. COUNTRY LANE. DAY. 26 
JACOBS sits in the passenger seat of Colin's Bristol sports car reading his stack of newspapers. After a moment he grunts in disgust. 
JACOBS Jeez, do you Brits actually read this stuff? He winds down his window and simply throws the whole lot out into the lane. The pages billow out in a great cloud behind the speeding car, landing in the pretty hedgerows and on neat front lawns. COLIN gapes in astonishment. Welcome to Hollywood. 
CUT TO: 
27 EXT. TIBBS FARM. DAY. 27 
JACOBS slouches out of the house, magnificently unimpressed. COTES-PREEDY follows him proudly with COLIN at his side. JACOBS takes a long, unimpressed look at the property. 
JACOBS What is this place? A brothel? COTES-PREEDY's face falls. 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 14A. 
COTES-PREEDY It's one of the best houses in the area. 
JACOBS Jesus. And I thought you Brits had taste. 
JACOBS (CONT'D) She's nuts about the Method. 
OLIVIER Stanislavski and the Method are perfectly fine in the rehearsal room but they don't belong on a film set. Time is too tight. I'm sure Marilyn understands. He turns and walks away. JACOBS frowns uncertainly. 
JACOBS Who the hell is this Commie Stan Slavski? 
CUT TO: 
32 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. PRODUCTION OFFICE. DAY. 32 
COLIN stands in the Production Office. DAVID ORTON (30s) the First Assistant Director, a thin, fair-haired man regards him with obvious irritation. 
ORTON I don't know why Hugh Perceval sent you here. There's nothing I can do for you. 
COLIN Why not? 
ORTON Are you in the union? 
COLIN No... 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 18. 
ORTON Then you can't have a job on the film. 
COLIN How do I get in the union? 
ORTON By getting a job on the film. 
COLIN But you just said I couldn't have a job on the film unless I was in the union. 
ORTON Exactly. It's called a closed shop. COLIN looks at him helplessly. ORTON relents a little. 
ORTON (CONT'D) I suppose I might be able to sort something out. The Union owes me a few favours. We haven't got a third yet. 
COLIN A third? 
ORTON Third Assistant Director. (Pause) You do know what the job is? 
COLIN Assisting the director? 
ORTON Christ, no! That's the last thing you do. Lesson One. The third's job is to do whatever the fuck I tell him. ORTON walks to the door, then looks back. 
ORTON (CONT'D) 
(SHOUTS) What are you waiting for? COLIN scrambles to follow him out. 
CUT TO: 
33 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. WARDROBE DEPT. DAY. 33 
As ORTON and COLIN pass the wardrobe department COLIN notices a pretty WARDROBE GIRL (LUCY) putting costumes on the racks. She has dark hair and laughing eyes and is a year or so younger than him. ORTON follows his gaze. 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 18A. 
ORTON Colin! COLIN jumps as ORTON glowers at him. 
ORTON (CONT'D) Lesson Two. You don't shit on your own doorstep. Got it? 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 19. 
COLIN Got it. But he sneaks a look back at LUCY as he goes. 
33A EXT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. DAY. 33A 
ORTON and COLIN hurry through Pinewood. 
ORTON Where are you staying? 
COLIN My father's place in the Albany. 
ORTON You can forget that. Lesson Three. The Third always stays nearby, not in some bloody palace in London. (Pause) Book a room at the Dog And Duck down the road. It's a bit rough but you'll get used to it. He grins, enjoying himself. 
ORTON (CONT'D) Now make yourself useful. Marilyn needs a bodyguard. Sort something out. 
CUT TO: 
34 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. PRODUCTION OFFICE. DAY. 34 
PERCEVAL sits with COLIN and ROGER SMITH. SMITH is a dignified figure in his mid-fifties. His erect bearing speaks of a lifetime in the police. 
PERCEVAL I'm sure you understand the sensitive nature of the job, Superintendant? 
ROGER No need for the title. I'm retired from the force. (Pause) Something about looking after a cinema actress? 
PERCEVAL Not just any actress. Marilyn Monroe. He gets no reaction from the stolid ex-policeman. 
ROGER I've never had much time for the pictures. 
BARRY The room's three quid a week, first week in advance. You're in number two. COLIN takes the key and his bag, just as BARRY adds, with perfect deadpan timing: 
BARRY (CONT'D) You'll be sharing with Grace Kelly. The LOCALS laugh into their beer. COLIN smiles gamely. 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 27B. 
45 INT. DOG AND DUCK PUB. COLIN'S ROOM. DAY. 45 
COLIN stands aghast. He is staying in a grim little room above the noisy saloon bar. The wallpaper is peeling, the furniture is ancient and the whole place reeks of damp. Dirty net curtains flutter in the window. He puts his bag on the bed and sits down. The mattress sags pitifully. He looks down and finds a stained and yellowing chamber pot under the bed. He slides it back with a look of revulsion. 
CUT TO: 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 28. 
46 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY. 46 
The principal cast of The Sleeping Prince, as it was still known at the time, assemble on the sound stage amongst the half-finished set. They chat and smoke, their scripts in their hands. OLIVIER stands in their midst, very much first amongst equals. One chair sits conspicuously unoccupied. DAME SYBIL THORNDIKE (74), severe-looking but kindly, very much the grand dame of the gathering, smiles cheerfully. RICHARD WATTIS leans over to her with a cheerful grin. 
WATTIS What a wonderful adventure, Dame Sybil. 
SYBIL THORNDIKE Such a lark! I long to see her. COLIN stands by the door. OLIVIER looks at his watch and shoots him a questioning glance. 
CUT TO: 
47 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. CORRIDOR/DRESSING ROOM. DAY. 47 
COLIN hurries along the corridor and stops outside Marilyn's dressing room. He knocks on it politely. 
COLIN Miss Monroe? The door opens sharply and a small, bohemian looking woman in her 50s stands staring at him. This is PAULA STRASBERG. 
COLIN (CONT'D) Sir Laurence sends his compliments. He's ready for the 
READTHROUGH He glances beyond PAULA to where MARILYN sits by the mirror, her reflection framed in the lights. She wears little or no make-up. PAULA looks at him sharply. 
PAULA But Marilyn is not ready. She's preparing. MARILYN glances up at COLIN in the mirror and smiles with unexpected simplicity. 
MARILYN Excuse the horrible face. She finds her dark glasses on the dresser and puts them on. 
CUT TO: 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 29. 
48 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. CORRIDOR. DAY. 48 
COLIN leads MARILYN and PAULA to the rehearsal room. He sneaks a glance at her. She has a vulnerable, lost expression. COLIN can't help staring at her until he notices PAULA looking at him and quickly glances away. 
CUT TO: 
49 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY. 49 
The cast are all seated around the large table as COLIN leads MARILYN and PAULA onto the stage. Marilyn keeps her dark glasses on throughout. OLIVIER rises to greet her. 
OLIVIER Marilyn, here you are, everyone is so excited to meet you... He gestures to the company. 
OLIVIER (CONT'D) Let us begin. Do sit down, please... SYBIL THORNDIKE looks sweetly at MARILYN from across the table and indicates the empty one at her side. 
SYBIL THORNDIKE How lovely you are. Here, I kept a place for you. PAULA bursts forward, steering Marilyn away instead to an empty seat on the other side of the rectangle of tables. She looks at RICHARD WATTIS, the actor occupying the seat next to the empty one. 
PAULA I have to be next to Marilyn! The startled WATTIS gets up graciously and troops all the way around the table to the seat next to SYBIL THORNDIKE. 
SYBIL THORNDIKE 
(TO MARILYN) Don't worry, dear, we won't bite. PAULA looks at her in truculent apology. 
PAULA She likes me by her side. 
SYBIL THORNDIKE What a good idea! I wish we could all bring a friend. One does get so terribly nervous. It's just like the first day at school, isn't it? 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 30. 
She smiles kindly at MARILYN who smiles back tentatively from behind her dark glasses. He smiles with considerable charm as he makes his opening speech of welcome. 
OLIVIER Welcome dear Marilyn, to our little fraternity. (Pause, looks around) We may seem a little strange and quaint to you at first, but I hope that in time you may come to find your method in our madness. Pleased with his over-contrived rhetorical flourish, he gives Paula a pointed look. She glowers back, obscurely sensing that she has been insulted in some way. MARILYN also looks up in confusion at Olivier's well intentioned but clumsy joke. Oblivious to her reaction, he opens his script with a sentimental flourish. 
OLIVIER (CONT'D) So. My very noble and approv'd good masters, let us now embark on our great voyage of discovery together. (Pause) With boldness and (we pray) good fortune, may we strive to create a work of art that, led by your good graces, will be cherished as long as motion pictures may be remembered. He is momentarily close to tears. WATTIS rolls his eyes discreetly, earning a grin from the actor PAUL HARDWICK. There is a rustle of pages and a few coughs, a mood of eager nervousness in the air as they all prepare for the reading. 
CUT TO: 
50 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY. 50 
Page 10. PAULA turns the pages of MARILYN's script for her, as though helping a child to read. OLIVIER is in full flow, employing a heavy Mittel European accent. 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 31. 
OLIVIER (AS REGENT) "Were you surprised to get my invitation?" MARILYN stares at him for a beat then reads haltingly. 
MARILYN (AS ELSIE) "I'll say I was surprised. I was so surprised I couldn't hardly think you meant me." 
SYBIL THORNDIKE It's so easily done, isn't it? I'm sure I went wrong somewhere there too. Shall we have another go, Larry?

SYBIL THORNDIKE (AS QUEEN DOWAGER) "Oh yes, my dear, of course I remember you well." 
MARILYN (AS ELSIE) 
(HALTING) "Oh, I'm quite sure you don't, your royal..., oh, I mean, your, uh, Imperial... your uh... serene majesty." It is not clear whether Marilyn's hesitance is acted or not but the others press on gamely. 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 40. 
SYBIL THORNDIKE (AS QUEEN DOWAGER) "What does she say?" 
OLIVIER (AS REGENT) "She says she is deeply flattered and compliments you on your wonderful memory." MARILYN jumps in, shouting her line over the top of him. 
MARILYN (AS ELSIE) "I'm in The Coconut Girl at The Avenue." There is a pause. SYBIL THORNDIKE hesitates. 
SYBIL THORNDIKE Didn't I have a line somewhere there, dear? 
OLIVIER Cut.

62 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY. 62 
The clapperboard snaps shut again. Take twelve. 
ORTON Action! 
SYBIL THORNDIKE (AS QUEEN DOWAGER) "Thank you, my dear. (Pause) Sweetly pretty. She should use more mascara. When one is young one should use a lot of mascara, and when one is old one should use much more. What do you do, my dear?" 
MARILYN (AS ELSIE) "I'm in The Coconut Girl at The Avenue". 
SYBIL THORNDIKE (AS QUEEN DOWAGER) 
(TO OLIVIER) "Dear?" 
OLIVIER (AS REGENT) "She says she is an actress." MARILYN looks at him, hesitant but just about in character. OLIVIER glances at ORTON who nods. 
OLIVIER (CONT'D) Cut it there. 
ORTON Check the gate. 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 41. 
FOCUS PULLER (After a second) Gate's good. 
OLIVIER Print. There is a near-audible sigh of relief around the set. SYBIL THORNDIKE smiles. 
SYBIL THORNDIKE That was perfect, Marilyn. You're Elsie to the life! MARILYN smiles awkwardly, not really believing her but SYBIL carries on with complete conviction. SYBIL THORNDIKE (cont'd) Perhaps we could practise our lines together later? You'd be doing me such a kindness. At my great age it's just so hard to make them stick! Why don't you come for tea tomorrow? In fact Sybil is word perfect every time, and everyone knows it. But it is a kind and tactful gesture. MARILYN's face lights up. 
MARILYN Can I? 
62A INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY. 62A 
OLIVIER looks at COLIN in dismay. 
OLIVIER She's impossible. I should have cast Vivien. 
COLIN If anyone can make her great, it's you. You're a genius. 
OLIVIER Oh, yes. The world's greatest living actor, so they say. OLIVIER looks at him, wanting to be reassured. He fumbles for a cigarette with shaking fingers and COLIN hurries to light it. He smiles wryly. 
OLIVIER (CONT'D) Let's hope I'm as brilliant as you think I am. (Pause) Now be a good boy and keep an eye on her. 
CUT TO: 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 42. 
63 INT. PINEWOOD. DRESSING ROOMS/CORRIDOR. DAY. 63 
MARILYN and PAULA are heading for the dressing room. MARILYN looks tired and disconnected. COLIN is just behind them on another errand. He can't help overhearing Paula's insistent, honeyed tones as she responds to Marilyn's uncertainty. 
MARILYN I just can't figure this movie out. 
PAULA You were wonderful. You are the most gifted actress I have ever known. You were superb, Marilyn. You were divine. 
MARILYN He was angry with me, I could tell. 
PAULA You were great. You are a great, great actress. All my life I have prayed for a great actress I could help and guide. She stops abruptly and gets down on her knees in the corridor in front of Marilyn. COLIN stops awkwardly, his path blocked. 
PAULA (CONT'D) Like this. I prayed to God on my knees. And he has given me you. You are that great actress, Marilyn. 
LUCY (CONT'D) That's my dad. She gives Colin a swift peck on the cheek as she tidies herself. A moment later the door opens and Lucy's father, MR. ARMSTRONG comes in, wearing his dressing gown over pyjamas. He glances at COLIN with a suspicious smile as he looks at his daughter. 
MR. ARMSTRONG Time to be thinking about bed, darling. Early start tomorrow. 
LUCY Sorry, Daddy. We were just going over tomorrow's schedule. COLIN and LUCY share a small, private smile. He takes his cue and stands up. 
COLIN Yes, I should be off. Colin Clark. Pleased to meet you, Mr. Armstrong. He offers the surprised MR. ARMSTRONG a confident handshake. 
COLIN (CONT'D) This is a very nice house you've got. 
MR. ARMSTRONG Do you know this part of the world? 
COLIN 
(THROWN) Umm... not really. My family are more country people. Lost for words they stare at each other for another moment before MR. ARMSTRONG smiles vaguely then goes. LUCY follows him with a smile at COLIN. He grins and whispers. 
COLIN (CONT'D) Next Saturday? She nods. He follows her out into the hall. 
CUT TO: 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 46. 
65B EXT. LUCY'S HOUSE. SUBURBS. NIGHT. 65B 
As he walks down the path, COLIN pauses. He looks around at the uniform semi-detached houses all around him. He is uncomfortable here, so far from the glamorous world of his parents or Pinewood studios. He has a strong sense that he and Lucy are from very different worlds, and walks to his car with an uneasy sense of relief to be getting away. 
CUT TO: 
66 EXT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. GATE. DAY. 66 
COLIN is back on the early morning watch. A black car draws up and SYBIL THORNDIKE leans out. 
SYBIL THORNDIKE Colin, dear, I thought you looked cold so I bought you this. She hands him a bright red woollen scarf. COLIN is touched. 
COLIN Thank you, Dame Sybil. 
SYBIL THORNDIKE Film sets and rehearsal rooms are the coldest places on earth. He smiles as her car drives away. He wraps the scarf around his neck and looks up and down the road again. 
CUT TO: 
67 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY. 67 
The crew stand around in sullen discontent. OLIVIER paces back and forth with MILTON at his side. 
OLIVIER She should be on time, like everyone else. 
MILTON She is a star. 
OLIVIER I'm a fucking star! He looks around in frustration. 
OLIVIER (CONT'D) If we nip this behaviour in the bud perhaps it won't be repeated. 
MILTON This is Marilyn you're talking about. 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 47. 
OLIVIER scowls at COLIN, who gives him a cigarette. MARILYN finally emerges with PAULA at her elbow. OLIVIER advances on her, his anger simmering. 
OLIVIER Marilyn, darling you are an angel, and I kiss the hem of your garment, but why can't you get here on time for the love of fuck? 
MARILYN Oh... you have that word in England too? She looks at him in surprise. She looks sedated, not quite there. PAULA leaps protectively to her defence. 
PAULA Marilyn has to prepare properly. She has to find in herself all that lies under the surface. Acting isn't just a case of putting on a costume or some ludicrous false nose. OLIVIER gives her a freezing look then takes Marilyn's hand, leading her forward like a child. 
OLIVIER You must apologise to Dame Sybil. MARILYN reddens with humiliation as he takes her arm.

OLIVIER propels MARILYN towards SYBIL THORNDIKE. MARILYN reddens with humiliation. 
MARILYN I'm sorry... 
SYBIL THORNDIKE (Cutting her off) My dear, you mustn't concern yourself. A great actress like you has many other things on her mind. A radiant smile spreads slowly across Marilyn's face as the older woman's words sink in. 
MARILYN You think I'm a great actress? 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 48. 
SYBIL THORNDIKE None of the rest of us truly know how to act for the camera. But you do. It is a rare gift. She looks sharply at OLIVIER. SYBIL THORNDIKE (cont'd) This poor girl hasn't had your years of experience. She is in a strange country, acting a strange part. Now, are you helping or bullying? OLIVIER looks aghast at being so roundly rebuked. COLIN looks on, startled. 
CUT TO: 
69 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. VIEWING THEATRE. DAY. 69 
OLIVIER, MILTON, PERCEVAL, ORTON and the editor JACK HARRIS watch rushes. COLIN lurks about unnoticed at the back. They watch one of OLIVIER's speeches (from the " The Coconut Girl" sequence we saw filming in Scenes 61 and 62). He is dry and clipped, every take precise and professional. It is an effective but theatrical performance. MARILYN sneaks in with ARTHUR MILLER. They sit in the back row watching her performance from the same scene. She fluffs take after take, gets her words wrong and pauses, looking dazed. COLIN notices her clutching MILLER's hand tightly. But finally a good take comes up. She is charming and natural and her performance suddenly makes OLIVIER's look stiff and clumsy. MILLER smiles in relief and reassurance. 
75 INT. LONDON. MARILYN'S CAR. DAY. 75 
COLIN sits in the front with ROGER driving. MARILYN, ARTHUR MILLER and MILTON GREENE sit in the back. 
CUT TO: 
76 EXT. LONDON. BOND STREET. DAY. 76 
It is very quiet in the normally busy West End. Shops have begun shutting after lunch and the city is rapidly emptying. SHOPPERS wander past, taking little notice of MARILYN who has her hair covered in a scarf and wears dark glasses. MILLER walks at her side, holding her hand. She glances at MILTON with an awkward laugh. 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 52. 
MARILYN Gee, it's quiet. 
COLIN It's Saturday. Early closing. But they're expecting us. She stops to window shop. MILTON lowers his voice to COLIN. 
MILTON No one's recognised her. 
COLIN At least she can shop in peace. 
MILTON Marilyn's a star. Stars don't even pee alone. He looks around anxiously. But then a PASSER-BY suddenly narrows his eyes and takes a second look. His face lights up and he shouts - 
PASSER-BY It's Marilyn Monroe! MARILYN gives him a radiant smile and within seconds is surrounded by a crowd of SHOPPERS alerted by the fuss. A feverish excitement grows out of nothing as people come running to look, pushing and shoving to see. MARILYN is quickly hemmed in by the heaving mob. To begin with she enjoys it, smiling and posing happily for the cameras that appear out of nowhere. But as the crowd press towards something in the mood of the gathering changes; it becomes wild and over-excited mood as people scream Marilyn's name and shove bits of paper to sign in her face. A WOMAN is pushed to the ground and MARILYN is forced back against the shop window. COLIN sees a flicker of panic on her face. 
ROGER My God, she'll be torn apart... 
MILLER Get her out of here. COLIN and ROGER hurl themselves into the crowd doing what they can to keep the excited fans at bay. They manage to force a path to the car, drag the door open and bundle MARILYN and MILLER into the back. MARILYN is pinned against the door and COLIN has to put his arm around her shoulders as he helps her in. He hurls himself into the front, with Milton running alongside the moving car to dive in beside Marilyn. People run alongside, hammering wildly on the windows in violent hysteria. MILTON does his best to put a cheerful gloss on the chaos. 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 53. 
MILTON Jeez, Marilyn, they really fucking love you. As COLIN looks in the rear-view mirror he sees MILLER shaking his head in dazed horror as MARILYN slumps half-collapsed into the seat beside him. 
MILLER Madness. Someone's going to get hurt. COLIN shifts his gaze to her in the mirror and his eyes meet Marilyn's. He sees - or imagines - a terrible sadness before she quickly replaces her dark glasses. 
CUT TO: 
77 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY. 77 
COLIN stands silently by the camera, watching MARILYN and RICHARD WATTIS, in character as Elsie Marina and Northbrook, open the doors of the Grand Duke's drawing room. 
MARILYN (AS ELSIE) "Well we're still the first ones, aren't we? Gee, this is all right, isn't it? OLIVIER looks out from behind the camera, patient and charming. 
OLIVIER Cut. The line is "Gee, this is all right too, isn't it". It's a tiny word, my darling, but it matters. Let's go straight away. MARILYN smiles vaguely. HAIR and MAKE-UP rush to do last minute checks. 
DENYS Camera running. 
SOUNDMAN Speed. 
DENYS Mark it. The clapperboard clatters down. Take two. WATTIS and MARILYN come in again on their cue. 
MARILYN (AS ELSIE) "Well we're still the first ones, aren't we? Gee, this is all right, isn't it?" 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 54. 
OLIVIER Cut. Nearly there, but Terry did work so very hard on this and we must try to get it right for him. Straight away, please. Take three. 
MARILYN (AS ELSIE) "Well, we're still the first ones, aren't we? Gee, this is... all right, isn't it?" By now there is a panic-stricken edge to her voice. 
OLIVIER Cut. 
MARILYN Can't we just drop it? 
OLIVIER The point is that you have already admired the downstairs hall in an earlier scene. Now you are admiring this room as well. 
MARILYN Oh, sure. (Pause, she looks stricken) Paula! OLIVIER looks startled. PAULA comes scurrying across. MARILYN appeals to her, turning away from OLIVIER. 
MARILYN (CONT'D) I don't get it. He's such a strange man. I think she'd figure out he only invited her to sleep with her. 
PAULA 
(TO OLIVIER) The reason Marilyn can't remember the line is because she doesn't believe the situation her character is in. OLIVIER takes out all his pent-up frustration on PAULA. 
OLIVIER Then she should pretend to believe it. PAULA bristles at this insult to her husband's work. 
PAULA Pretend? We're talking about the difference between the truth and artificial crap. 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 54A. 
OLIVIER We're in absolute agreement, Paula. Acting is all about sincerity. And if you can fake that, you're off to the races. PAULA only stares at him in disgust. Thoroughly alarmed, MILTON intervenes. 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 55. 
MILTON Maybe we should try for another take. 
PAULA Marilyn needs time to give a great performance. You should give her as long as it takes. Chaplin took eight months to make a movie. 
OLIVIER Eight months of this? I'd rather kill myself. Throughout all this MARILYN herself looks lost. COLIN watches her as she feels the crew's irritable collective gaze. Flustered, she flutters her hands in a calming gesture, then goes to the side of the set to lean on a bar put there for her to rest on (her costume is too tight to allow her to sit down). PAULA accompanies her. MARILYN looks up at her in anguish. 
MILTON You have to be patient with her. 
OLIVIER Trying to teach Marilyn how to act is like teaching Urdu to a badger. MILTON gives him a look but says nothing. Instead he picks up his bag and opens it. It is stuffed with bottles of pills. He takes one of them, checks the label and puts it in his pocket. 
MILTON I better go see her. She'll need something to help her calm down. COLIN holds the door for him as he goes out. 
OLIVIER (After a second) Pills to sleep, pills to wake up. Pills to calm her down, pills to give her energy. No wonder she's permanently ten feet underwater. 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 59. 
COLIN looks at him tentatively. 
COLIN Maybe she's scared. 
OLIVIER We're all scared. It's part of being an actor. 
COLIN But you have the training to deal with it. OLIVIER turns from the mirror to survey him. 
OLIVIER I wouldn't buy the little girl lost act if I were you. Though heaven knows it's tempting. He sighs wistfully. 
OLIVIER (CONT'D) And I think Marilyn knows exactly what she's doing. COLIN isn't so sure but wisely holds his tongue. 
OLIVIER (CONT'D) You better get over to Parkside and make sure the poor girl's all right. (Pause) And Colin? Don't forget who you work for.

COLIN draws up outside Marilyn's house. The place is dark and quiet. 
CUT TO: 
82 INT. PARKSIDE HOUSE. DRAWING ROOM NIGHT. 82 
ROGER takes two bottles of beer from the well stocked drinks cabinet and hands one to COLIN, putting a coaster for him on the coffee table. COLIN looks around the opulent drawing room. 
COLIN Are you sure they won't mind? 
ROGER Help yourself. They can spare it. (Pause) Marilyn's okay. She's taken some pills and gone to bed. He frowns darkly. 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 60. 
ROGER (CONT'D) They like to keep her doped up. It makes her easier to control. 
COLIN You mean Miller? 
ROGER (Shakes his head) The others. They're terrified their cash cow will slip away. He smiles grimly and raises his beer bottle. 
ROGER (CONT'D) Cheers! 
CUT TO: 
83 INT. PARKSIDE HOUSE. DRAWING ROOM. NIGHT. 83 
COLIN wakes abruptly from a doze as his empty bottle of beer rolls to the floor. ROGER is fast asleep. COLIN glances at the clock. It is nearly midnight. 
CUT TO: 
84 INT. PARKSIDE HOUSE. UPSTAIRS HALL. NIGHT. 84 
COLIN, a little drunk, creeps out of the toilet. The narrow strip of light from the door disappears, leaving the hall in darkness. COLIN inches forward uncertainly. He stops, waiting for his eyes to adjust. The house is totally silent. Then, just as he is about to move, he hears something. Breathing, very close by. Faint but unmistakable. Shallow breaths, like sighs. COLIN is paralysed. A beat, then - A door is flung open along the hall and light floods into the corridor. MARILYN is sitting on the carpet leaning against the wall only a few feet away from Colin. She is wrapped in a pink bed-cover and stares directly at him, her expression blank and sedated. By her side is an open spiral bound notebook, its pages closely crammed with handwriting. 
MILLER 
(OFF) Marilyn. Come back to bed. It's not what you think. 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 61. 
She stares at COLIN. It is not even clear she knows he is there. COLIN gazes back at her, paralysed. MILLER's voice comes again, flat and tired. 
MILLER (CONT'D) 
(OFF) It's just a few ideas. Writer's stuff. (Pause) Bring back my book and let's get some sleep. Finally MARILYN stirs and closes the notebook. Holding it to her breast and clutching the cover around her shoulders she gets up and goes into the bedroom, closing the door. As the light snaps off COLIN breathes for the first time in what feels like minutes. 
CUT TO: 
85 EXT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. GATE. DAY. 85 
COLIN, muffled in his scarf, looks up as Marilyn's car cruises to a halt at the gate. 
COLIN Good morning, Miss Monroe. She is hunched in the back, her hair in a scarf, her face protected by her large sunglasses with PAULA by her side. She doesn't look up. 
CUT TO: 
86 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUNDSTAGE. DAY. 86 
OLIVIER, DAVID ORTON and COLIN huddle around the camera. JEREMY SPENSER and TECHNICIANS stand around, bored and listless. MILTON appears. They speak in low, urgent tones. 
COLIN Paula was with us the whole time. 
WATTIS The mind boggles, dear. COLIN smiles but his expression freezes as he looks up to see LUCY nearby. She has heard every word of the exchange. 
CUT TO: 
90 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY. 90 
MARILYN is finally back on the set, filming a solo dance routine. Released from the need to remember any words she takes refuge in the physical activity, undulating sexily in her tight white dress in a performance which is gawky, mildly silly and charming all at the same time. The dance is deliberately a little amateurish. Elsie Marina isn't meant to be any sort of superstar. But she radiates joy and innocence and sheer happiness in the dance, and MARILYN captures all this perfectly. Within the scene the actor JEREMY SPENSER, playing Nicky, watches from the doorway. Everyone watches silently from behind the camera. No one can look away, least of all COLIN. It feels like one purely joyful moment in the agony the film has become, and Marilyn is radiant. Even OLIVIER has a reluctant half-smile on his face as he watches. 
CUT TO: 
91 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. NIGHT. 91 
The stage is empty except for OLIVIER and MILLER. They sit in a pool of light in the cavernous room. COLIN pours whisky for them and then steps back into the shadows. Both men ignore him. He is too unimportant to worry about. MILLER leans forward, holding his pipe but not smoking it. 
MILLER I dreamed last night I could hear singing. And then I realised it wasn't a dream. There was a male voice choir serenading Marilyn under our window. At two in the morning. It's a circus. A freak show. OLIVIER smiles but MILLER looks dazed. 
MILLER (CONT'D) I'm going back to New York for a few days. I need to see my kids. I need a break. 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 65. 
OLIVIER That won't help Marilyn. 
MILLER (After a moment) I can't help her. (Pause) You know what she loves to do most? Sleep. It's what she lives for. Sleep is her demon. He pauses for a second. 
MILLER (CONT'D) I've disappointed her. OLIVIER looks at him. MILLER shakes his head. 
MILLER (CONT'D) She thought I could smash all her insecurities with one magical stroke. That I could make her a new person. He pauses for a second, weighing every word carefully. 
MILLER (CONT'D) She wants me to protect her but I can't. I can't even protect myself. (Pause) She read some notes I made. They were nothing. Just a few ideas. 
OLIVIER About her? He looks up and nods slowly. 
MILLER She took them the wrong way. He leaves a long, uneasy pause. 
OLIVIER But you do love her? Your new bride and all that? MILLER plays with his whisky. 
MILLER I can't work. I can't think. (Pause) She's devouring me. Forgotten in the shadows, COLIN listens attentively to every word.

92 EXT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. GATE. DAY. 92 
Early morning. COLIN sees Olivier's black Bentley cruising towards the gate. VIVIEN LEIGH sits in the back seat. 
VIVIEN Hello, Colin darling. You look like Horatio defending the bridge. Are you going to let me in? 
CUT TO: 
93 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY. 93 
VIVIEN is doing what amounts to a royal tour. She greets everyone, from the lowest chippie to the Heads of Department with the same flirtatious grace. OLIVIER walks at her elbow. The crew crowd around her. She is easy and relaxed, relishing every second of their attention. 
VIVIEN I hope Larry isn't making you all work too hard. I know what a dreadful slave driver he can be. She sees ORTON and takes his hands. 
VIVIEN (CONT'D) David, he would be lost without you. 
ORTON Just doing my job. Tough as he is, he melts visibly. She moves on to JACK CARDIFF, the lighting cameraman, looking at him in mock misery. 
VIVIEN I'm getting old, Jack. I need you to work your miracles on me. 
CARDIFF You're more beautiful every year, Vivien. She laughs and turns to COLIN, looking at him severely. 
VIVIEN Now, you are looking after Larry like I told you? 
COLIN I'm doing my best... VIVIEN glances away to see MARILYN standing nearby, awkward and excluded. She has come straight from make-up and wears only a towelling robe, slippers and curlers in her hair. 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 67. 
Compared to VIVIEN she looks frumpish. VIVIEN glides towards her, hands extended. 
VIVIEN Darling Marilyn! She kisses her on both cheeks and holds her hands. 
VIVIEN (CONT'D) Larry tells me you are quite, quite superb. I'm wild with jealousy. 
MARILYN Oh, but everyone says you were a wonderful Elsie on stage. 
VIVIEN But I'm too old to play her in the film. Larry was quite brutal about that. You see, the truth is all that matters to him. That's why we all admire him so very much. She glances at OLIVIER with a fluttering laugh. He smiles back with a haunted look in his eyes. 
VIVIEN (CONT'D) Now, I must let you work. I only came to wish you good luck! Goodbye, everyone! The crew press around her. MARILYN watches, feeling more than ever the odd one out. COLIN watches her from the edge of the crowd. She cuts a lonely, vulnerable figure. He is totally preoccupied with her, so much so that when VIVIEN comes up behind him he turns guiltily as though caught out. VIVIEN stares at him. All her exuberance has vanished and she looks suddenly tired and older. It as though the facade of a beautiful building is beginning to crack. She gazes at him with bitter disappointment. 
VIVIEN (CONT'D) Oh, Colin. Not you too. He wants to protest but VIVIEN is already turning away. 
CUT TO: 
OLIVIER Well? What did she want? 
COLIN She wants to see me. 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 71. 
He shrugs awkwardly. MILTON looks at OLIVIER in panic. 
MILTON He shouldn't be talking to her. He's just a kid. Supposing he says something? (Pause) Why the hell didn't she call me? His angry - and jealous - frustration is in stark contrast to OLIVIER, who looks at COLIN with a new interest, wondering if there is anything in this odd situation that can work to his advantage. He smiles calmly. 
OLIVIER I'm sure Colin knows what he's doing. Don't you, Colin? There is a warning as well as approval in his tone. 
CUT TO: 
97 INT. PARKSIDE HOUSE. DRAWING ROOM. DAY. 97 
ROGER leads COLIN into the formal drawing room. 
ROGER Miss Monroe said for you to wait. She won't be long. He looks at COLIN dubiously as he goes out. COLIN is nervous and not quite sure what to do with himself. He looks at the drinks in their decanters on the sideboard and is suddenly desperate for some Dutch courage. He finds the brandy and picks it up - 
MARILYN 
(OFF) Help yourself to a drink. COLIN wheels in surprise. MARILYN stands in the doorway, casually but beautifully dressed in silk trousers and a pale cream shirt. COLIN looks guiltily at the brandy. 
COLIN I was just... checking you've got everything you need. She walks to the sideboard, standing only a few inches away from him. He can't take his eyes from hers. He drops his gaze, only to find himself staring at her breasts. He looks up again sharply but not before she notices. She takes the decanter from his hand. 
MARILYN Here, let me. She pours some brandy into a glass and gives it to him. 
MARILYN (CONT'D) Are you frightened of me, Colin? 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 72. 
COLIN No. 
MARILYN Good. Because I like you. Colin doesn't know what to say. MARILYN gazes at him. 
MARILYN (CONT'D) I want you to help me. Will you do that? She looks at him, her eyes wide. COLIN feels himself sinking into her gaze. 
COLIN I'm only the third. Just a messenger, really. 
MARILYN But you know what's going on. You can see both sides of the situation. He shrugs in helpless agreement. 
MARILYN (CONT'D) I want you to be honest. Tell me everything. She indicates a chair and COLIN perches on it awkwardly. 
MARILYN (CONT'D) Relax. I thought you weren't scared of me. (Pause) Are you hungry? I'll have them send in a tray. I'm starved. He doesn't know how to reply and Marilyn misreads his silence. Her eyes widen in dismay. 
MARILYN (CONT'D) Oh, gee, I'm sorry. Am I interrupting something? Maybe you have a Mrs. Colin waiting for you at home? 
COLIN There's no Mrs. Colin. 
MARILYN So we can talk as long as we like? He nods uncertainly. She frowns. 
MARILYN (CONT'D) Why is Sir Olivier so mean? He talks to me as if he's slumming. 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 73. 
COLIN hesitates then decides to throw caution to the wind. 
COLIN I'll tell you what's wrong. It's agony for him because he's a great actor who wants to be a film star, and agony for you because you're a film star who wants to be a great actress. And this film won't help either of you. He stops, breathless, knowing he has gone to far. She stares at him, wide-eyed with surprise. Horribly self- conscious he takes a too large swig of his brandy, reddens and coughs. She laughs. 
MARILYN Are you sure you can handle that? You don't look old enough to drink. 
COLIN I'm 23, Miss Monroe. 
MARILYN It's Marilyn. (Pause) I'm 30. I guess that makes me an old lady to you. 
COLIN Seven years is nothing. She smiles then sits opposite him. 
MARILYN Do you know I've been married three times already? How did that happen? 
COLIN You were just looking for the right man. 
MARILYN They always look right at the start. She smiles wistfully. Her presence is overwhelming. The silence stretches for a second, pregnant with strange possibilities. Suddenly the phone rings, making him jump. Automatically he picks it up. 
COLIN Hello?

There is no one else around. The wind sighs and the grass is pleasantly warm underfoot. MARILYN turns her face up to the sun. 
MARILYN This is how I ought to feel every day. COLIN smiles. Impulsively MARILYN hugs him. 
MARILYN (CONT'D) Let's run away together. He turns ashen. 
MARILYN (CONT'D) 
(LAUGHS) Just kidding. She looks around happily. COLIN smiles at her. 
COLIN We have today, anyway. One day to do whatever we like. We can go back to real life tomorrow. 
MARILYN Only one day? 
COLIN Well, maybe the weekend. 
MARILYN Or a week? He grins. She takes his hand, walking contentedly at his side.

ROGER has parked up by the sentry post at the entrance to the castle. There are two uniformed POLICEMEN on duty. ROGER nods to the policemen, who instantly recognise one of their own. 
ROGER Detective Chief Superintendant Smith. I'm escorting this lady and gentleman for the day. They'd like to look around the castle. As the policemen see MARILYN their eyes widen. 
POLICEMAN Christ, is that..? He stares in disbelief. ROGER smiles. 
ROGER Well, it's not Diana bloody Dors, is it? 
POLICEMAN (After a second) Does she know anyone here, sir? We need to write down a contact name in the book. ROGER looks stumped at this. He turns to Marilyn. 
ROGER You don't know Her Majesty, by any chance? 
MARILYN We met at a movie premiere. She said my dress was pretty. 
POLICEMAN I'm not sure that quite... 
COLIN 
(INTERRUPTING) My Godfather works here. He's the Royal librarian, Sir Owen Morshead. The POLICEMAN looks sceptically at Colin's casual clothes. 
POLICEMAN Name? 
COLIN Clark. Colin Clark. The POLICEMAN retreats into his box. We hear him talking on the telephone. ROGER looks at COLIN. He shrugs sheepishly.

COLIN Take that room up there. They stop as COLIN points up at a window. 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 90. 
COLIN That's where the boys were sent if they didn't work hard enough. Where we were whipped. MARILYN looks at him in shock. 
MARILYN Whipped? 
COLIN Beaten. She looks appalled. 
MARILYN I'd never send my kids away. (pause) How long were you here? 
COLIN Five years. But I was sent to boarding school when I was eight. 
MARILYN Why? 
COLIN That's what we do in my family. She smiles at this, looking at him shrewdly. 
MARILYN It seems to me that you've had most things pretty easy. 
COLIN In one way, yes. But when you're brought up in a house of over- achievers, it's hard to make your own mark. She looks at him, sympathetic but pushing a little harder. 
MARILYN So how are you going to do it? 
COLIN Maybe it will be in films, but if not, there are so many possibilities out there. 
MARILYN Sounds pretty good to me. She smiles warmly, liking him a lot more for his openness. We sense their relationship has moved quietly to a different and deeper level. But before either of them can say anything a SCHOOLBOY turns the corner in his Eton uniform. 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 90A. 
He looks up at MARILYN, his mouth hanging open in shock. Then he simply turns and runs, shouting at the top of his voice. 
SCHOOLBOY Marilyn! It's Marilyn Monroe!

MARILYN and COLIN are swamped in a joyous mass of Eton students. MARILYN smiles, waves, pouts, even kisses one boy on the cheek. Cheering BOYS hang out of every window. MARILYN blows kisses to them all. ROGER has to plunge into the crowd to rescue her. COLIN follows after them with difficulty. MARILYN pauses, jumping on a bench to wave goodbye and blow more kisses to the boys. 
MARILYN Work hard, boys! I don't want anyone whipping you! A gawky young teenager near the front shouts out cheekily. 
BOY You can whip me anytime, Marilyn! MARILYN laughs in delight. There are cheers as COLIN escorts her away.

After the riotous excitement of the Eton schoolyard the peace and quiet of the river. MARILYN rushes along the sandy bank. The water glitters magically. 
MARILYN Hurry up, slow poke. 
COLIN But we haven't got any... He stops in mid-sentence as he sees MARILYN unbuttoning her blouse and throwing it off carelessly. 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 91. 
He tears his eyes away from her as she casually strips her clothes off. He hurries to find a bush to get changed behind. As he ducks down behind it he hears a splash and MARILYN's cry of shock as she hits the water. 
MARILYN Oh my gosh! It's freezing!

MARILYN Don't worry. Roger will fix it. Oh, darn it... She holds her head and he looks at her with concern. 
MILTON is waiting for COLIN at the door. 
MILTON Marilyn's not well. 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 95. 
COLIN But she was wonderful yesterday. MILTON looks at him for a long moment, masking his hostility in barbed politeness. 
MILTON I don't know what you did to her, kid, but she got nervous. I had to give her some pills to calm her down. 
COLIN She doesn't need pills! She just needs someone to care for her. 
MILTON Someone like you? COLIN reddens. MILTON shakes his head patronisingly. 
COLIN I told you, I'm not in love with her! 
MILTON You kissed her. 
COLIN She said that? 
MILTON Spare me the bullshit. I know everything. COLIN stares at him, feeling hopelessly out of his depth. 
MILTON (CONT'D) You messed her up, kid. Confused her. He comes very close, his tone fierce but wounded. 
MILTON (CONT'D) I've got every penny I ever made tied up in Marilyn. She owes me. If it wasn't for me she'd still be on contracts that make slave wages look good. I gave her back her freedom, and now Miller's turning her against me. That's what you get for trying to help Marilyn Monroe. He goes back to the house, pausing at the door, speaking more in sorrow than anger. 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 96. 
MILTON (CONT'D) If you want to play with the grown-ups, Colin, start learning the rules. 
CUT TO: 
129 INT. PUB. COLIN'S BEDROOM. NIGHT. 129 
A gentle summer breeze lifts the net curtains. COLIN is fast asleep. There's a sharp rap at the door. 
ROGER 
(OFF) Colin! (Pause) Colin! COLIN opens his eyes, his mind drugged with sleep. 
COLIN Roger? What's the matter? 
ROGER 
(OFF) It's Marilyn. A cold dread clutches at COLIN's stomach. He stumbles out of bed and opens the door. ROGER stands in the doorway 
COLIN Is she dead? 
ROGER She's asking for you. She's sick. I think she might be in a coma. 
COLIN How can she be asking for me if she's in a coma? 
ROGER Just bloody get dressed! 
CUT TO: 
130 EXT. PARKSIDE HOUSE. DRIVE. NIGHT. 130 
ROGER and COLIN drive up. MILTON, waits on the steps. He looks resentfully at COLIN but doesn't say anything. 
CUT TO: 
131 INT. PARKSIDE HOUSE. MARILYN'S BEDROOM. NIGHT. 131 
PAULA STRASBERG paces frantically outside Marilyn's bedroom door as ROGER, MILTON and COLIN hurry up the stairs. 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 97. 
PAULA She hasn't made a sound for over an hour. 
ROGER We should break down the door. 
COLIN How many pills did she take? 
MILTON Oh, Jesus, who knows? I wasn't counting. COLIN knocks gently. 
COLIN Marilyn? There is no reply. 
CUT TO: 
132 EXT. PARKSIDE HOUSE. GARDEN. NIGHT. 132 
ROGER and COLIN carry a ladder across the moonlit gravel and prop it up against the wall. 
ROGER That's her window. He points with his torch. The window is open. COLIN shins up the ladder while ROGER holds it. 
COLIN I'll open the door once I'm inside. 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 101. 
COLIN Writers scribble all kinds of things. It doesn't mean anything. She looks at him, her eyes full of pain. 
MARILYN He wanted me to find it. It said he should never have married me. That I was unpredictable and a woman-child, flighty and self- centred. He's left me, Colin. Why do the people I love always leave me? She looks so wretched, so completely baffled, that COLIN responds with sudden passion. 
COLIN I'll never leave you. She smiles and embraces him gratefully. She sighs. 
MARILYN All people ever see is Marilyn Monroe. As soon as they realise I'm not her, they run. He lies down next to her, taking her awkwardly in his arms. She sighs sleepily. 
MARILYN (CONT'D) Boy, there's a lot of men in this business. And they all think you've got to sleep with them. She looks across at him, their faces inches apart. 
MARILYN (CONT'D) You're not like that. That's why I like you. COLIN stares back at her guiltily. She smiles. 
MARILYN (CONT'D) You should date that Wardrobe lady. She's pretty. 
COLIN I don't want to. (Pause) I love you, Marilyn. She stares at him and tears gather in her eyes again. They stare intently at each other, their mood fragile, touched with both sensuality and a longing for something less tangible. MARILYN leans forward and kisses him gently. The embrace grows in passion and they kiss properly, hungrily. He kisses her eyes and her face and she sighs happily. He wants her more than he has wanted anything before. 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 102. 
And then he stops. The fantasy he has been pursuing for weeks is within his grasp but he knows that whatever it does for him it will only damage her further. He pulls away from her gently. Her eyes flicker open lazily. 
MARILYN What's the matter? Don't you want to make love? 
COLIN Maybe we should just be friends. 
MARILYN Okay. Friends. She wraps herself around him, curling up so their bodies cradle each other like spoons in a cutlery draw. As she buries her head in his neck he feels her breasts against his back. She curls against him. 
MARILYN (CONT'D) This is nice. Like spoons. I used to do this with Johnny. 
COLIN Who's Johnny? 
MARILYN Johnny Hyde. My agent, back in the old days. He was thin, like you... Her voice is blurred and drifting with sleep. With her body warm against him COLIN's resolve nearly snaps but he is clear eyed now and determined. 
COLIN Marilyn? She mutters softly in reply. 
COLIN (CONT'D) Do one thing for me? Come into the studio on time tomorrow and show everybody what you can do. Show Larry you're a great actress. 
MARILYN 
(BLURRED) Okay. He smiles and turns out the light. 
CUT TO: 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 103. 
135 INT. PARKSIDE. MARILYN'S BEDROOM/BATHROOM. DAY. 135 
First light streams in through the curtains. COLIN wakes to hear Marilyn singing cheerfully. He gets up and sees her through the open door of the bathroom sitting in the bath, her back towards him. She is practicing the gentle waltz tune she is to sing in the film. 
MARILYN "I found a dream and lay in your arms the whole night through... I'm yours no matter what others may say or do... She has never sounded so happy or carefree. COLIN smiles. 
CUT TO: 
136 EXT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. GATE. DAY. 136 
COLIN races up the road and arrives panting at the gate a few seconds before OLIVIER's car swings into the entrance. The great man leans out of the back window. 
OLIVIER Morning, boy. (Pause) Christ, you look rough. He looks at him thoughtfully, then shrugs. 
OLIVIER (CONT'D) Let me know when Marilyn arrives. If she ever does. 
COLIN Oh, I'm pretty sure she'll be in this morning. OLIVIER gives COLIN an odd look. 
CUT TO: 
137 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY. 137 
MARILYN, OLIVIER and WATTIS act a scene together; a drunken Elsie Marina is being seduced by the Grand Duke, and Northbrook bursts in to interrupt them as a VALET plays the violin in the doorway behind him. 
WATTIS (AS NORTHBROOK) "Your Grand Ducal Highness.." 
OLIVIER (AS REGENT) "This is intolerable"! 
WATTIS (AS NORTHBROOK) "With the deepest respect, sir, my message was so important I had no choice but to intrude". 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 104. 
OLIVIER (AS REGENT) "Revolution?" 
WATTIS (AS NORTHBROOK) "No, sir, Miss Marina's aunt has been in a motor accident. The hospital is calling for her most urgently." 
MARILYN (AS ELSIE) "What? (Giggles drunkenly) Oh, go away, you silly man." 
WATTIS (AS NORTHBROOK) "Miss Marina, your aunt... you realise how serious her condition is?" 
MARILYN (AS ELSIE) "Well, it's her own fault. She has no right being out at this time of night. She's 93!" MARILYN is utterly adorable. The crew, COLIN, amongst them, can't take their eyes off her. OLIVIER glances at ORTON behind the camera. They have a good take and they know it. 
COLIN I haven't done anything. She's just... got a stomach ache. He reddens with embarrassment. ROGER coughs. 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 108. 
ROGER I think he means her monthlies. 
PAULA What will Arthur say if she dies? 
COLIN She's not dying, for Christ's sake. The HOUSEKEEPER now appears at the door with an elderly man at her side. He nods briskly. 
CONNELL I'm Dr. Connell. Is the patient in there? 
PAULA Please save her... it's Marilyn Monroe. You can't let her die. CONNELL calmly extracts himself from her grasp. 
CONNELL Perhaps you'd all like to give us a little privacy? As COLIN shepherds the others out MILTON turns on him bitterly. 
MILTON Happy now, kid? 
CUT TO: 
143 INT. PARKSIDE HOUSE. HALL. NIGHT. 143 
DR. CONNELL stands in the hall outside the bedroom writing out a prescription and smoking a cigarette. He tears the prescription off the pad and looks up. 
CONNELL Who's in charge here? MILTON, PAULA, ROGER and COLIN all step forward as one. CONNELL gives them a wry look and shrugs. 
CONNELL (CONT'D) I've given Mrs. Miller an injection and the bleeding has stopped. She needs to stay in bed tomorrow but after that she'll be fine. I suggest someone stays with her. PAULA leans forward and almost snatches the prescription from his hand. 
PAULA She'll be safe with me. 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 109. 
She looks bitterly at Colin. 
CUT TO: 
144 EXT. PARKSIDE HOUSE. NIGHT. 144 
COLIN walks CONNELL to his car, their feet crunching on the gravel. 
CONNELL Well, goodnight then. COLIN holds the door open as he gets in. 
COLIN Was she really pregnant? 
CONNELL I think that's a private matter between Mr and Mrs. Miller. He looks at COLIN with cool disapproval, then closes the door and drives off. COLIN stands watching, shivering in his shirtsleeves. 
CUT TO: 
145 INT. PARKSIDE HOUSE. MARILYN'S BEDROOM. NIGHT. 145 
COLIN creeps into the room and sits on the bed. MARILYN is awake. She gazes at him, hazy but lucid. 
MARILYN We have to say goodbye now, Colin. Arthur's on his way back. When this film is over I'm going to settle down and be a good wife to him. I'm going to learn to make Matzo ball soup as good as his dad's. She smiles wistfully at the fantasy. 
MARILYN (CONT'D) We have to forget this ever happened. 
COLIN I don't want to forget. He struggles then suddenly bursts out passionately. 
COLIN (CONT'D) Let me protect you from all this... She smiles sadly. 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 110. 
MARILYN What do you want to do? Marry me? 
COLIN Why not? You could come and live at my parents place. You'd love it. It's a castle, like in a fairy tale. We wouldn't even have to live together. You could have your own suite of rooms... He is close to tears, suddenly looking very young. She looks at him with a sad, sweet smile. He shakes his head stubbornly, taking her hand in passionate appeal. 
COLIN (CONT'D) You could quit. Forget Marilyn Monroe, forget Hollywood. Let it all go. 
MARILYN This is what I've worked for my whole life. I couldn't just give it all up. 
COLIN Why not, when it drives you crazy? Her eyes widen in surprise. A flicker of nervous insecurity dulls her expression. 
MARILYN You think I'm crazy? 
COLIN I didn't mean that. I just meant you could be happy. 
MARILYN I am happy. I got everything I ever dreamed about. She smiles tentatively, but he sees a terrible fear in her eyes. He looks down, realising with a cruel stab of pain that Olivier was right. There is no way back. She doesn't want to be rescued. He finally looks up, smiling despite the tears in his eyes. 
COLIN Of course you're happy. (Pause) You're a star. The biggest star in the world. She smiles, reassured. He drags himself off the bed and goes to the door, pausing for a second as he looks back. 
COLIN (CONT'D) You're right, Marilyn. We have to forget all this. 
(MORE) 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 111- 
COLIN (CONT'D) From now on I'm nobody. Just the third. You don't even know I exist. We'll never look at each other again. She giggles with some of her old playfulness. 
150A INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. WARDROBE DEPT. DAY. 150A 
The wardrobe department is empty except for LUCY, who cradles her own gift from Marilyn. COLIN comes in, looking nervous. They look at each other awkwardly. 
COLIN Aren't you going to throw yours away? 
LUCY Of course not. It's from Marilyn Monroe. He smiles. She shrugs and turns to leave. 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 115. 
COLIN (After a second) Lucy? She turns back to look at him. 
COLIN (CONT'D) I was wondering if you're doing anything this Saturday. 
LUCY I'm washing my hair. He nods, accepting this as no more than he deserves. She goes but then stops to look back at him. 
LUCY (CONT'D) Did she break your heart? 
COLIN (After a second) A little. 
LUCY Good. It needed breaking. There is no malice in her response, just an awareness that he is older and wiser now, and perhaps a better man for the experience. He nods, accepting the rebuke. 
LUCY (CONT'D) (After a second) I might be free on Wednesday. COLIN smiles. She goes out. He looks down at Marilyn's present in his hands. 
CUT TO: 
151 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. HALL. DAY. 151 
COLIN walks down the hall. He notices the red light is on outside the viewing theatre. As he goes towards it he sees ROGER coming the other way on his way out of the studio, his job done. The two men smile; an acknowledgment of everything they've been through together. ROGER offers him a friendly salute and then goes on his way. 
152 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. VIEWING THEATRE. DAY. 152 
OLIVIER sits on his own, watching an edited version of the "The Coconut Girl" sequence (Scenes 61 and 62). COLIN comes in. OLIVIER glances at him. 
OLIVIER "You do look, my son, in a moved sort/As if you were dismay'd: be cheerful, sir./Our revels now are ended. 
(MORE) 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 116. 
OLIVIER (CONT'D) These our actors,/As I foretold you, were all spirits and/Are melted into air, into thin air... 
COLIN Prospero. 
OLIVIER 
(SMILES) We are such stuff/As dreams are made on, and our little life/Is rounded with a sleep..." COLIN sits down next to the great man. They watch in silence as another sequence is projected for them. The sequence shows MARILYN improvising in the champagne and caviar scene. She serves herself food and drink before collapsing, drunk. The endless retakes and fluffs gone, what remains is a gifted comic performance by a luminous beauty. 
OLIVIER (CONT'D) (After a second) She's quite wonderful. No training, no craft, no guile, just pure instinct. Astonishing. He seems almost lost in awe. COLIN gazes at him in surprise. 
COLIN You should tell her that. 
OLIVIER Oh, I will. But she won't believe me. That's probably what makes her great. It's certainly what makes her so profoundly unhappy. He smiles wryly. 
OLIVIER (CONT'D) I tried my best to change her, but she remains brilliant despite me. (Pause) Directing a movie has to be just about the best job ever invented, but Marilyn has cured me of ever wanting to do it again. He signals to the projection box and the film stops as the lights come up. 
OLIVIER (CONT'D) And now I'm going back to the theatre. John Osborne is writing a piece for me. 
COLIN I thought you hated all that Royal Court stuff. 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 117. 
OLIVIER 
(SMILES) Miller made me see things differently. (Pause) You have to find new worlds to conquer, if you want to be the best. And believe me, most of the time, I really am the best. He goes to the door and pauses. 
OLIVIER (CONT'D) You've done a good job, boy. (Pause) Welcome to the circus. He goes out. COLIN looks back up at the projection box. 
COLIN Run it again, please. The lights go down. MARILYN's face appears on the screen, laughing and happy. It is another sequence, the one where Marilyn does her sweet, uninhibited little dance (Scene 90), a performance both sexy and yet touchingly innocent. HOLD on COLIN for a long moment, gazing at her image in the darkness, then - 
152A INT. DOG AND DUCK PUB. DAY 152A 
The circus is leaving. The film is shutting down. Not knowing his next job COLIN sits, suitcase next to his chair, wearing the 'Marilyn' experience on his face and in his soul. Head down, sipping a pint. He could be a regular here. BARRY behind the bar, flitting around - the dart players and regulars at play. And then, as if a gust of wind invaded, BARRY looks up and freezes. The DART PLAYER, sensing something, turns to look up as well. The regulars are frozen in mid-action. COLIN is missing it all. 100% of his attention is given to his woe and his pint. 
MARILYN Buy a girl a drink? COLIN doesn't turn. He recognizes the voice and smiles. 
COLIN Can I get another one of those please, Barry? BARRY for once is silent, pours a pint. The regulars try not to stare. 
MARILYN I didn't want to leave without saying goodbye. 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 117A. 
MARILYN hands COLIN a package. 
MARILYN (CONT'D) The first time you saw this, all I had on was the radio. Colin opens the package. It's her copy of the script. On the first page she has written a message scrawled in ink: TO THE 
MOST CHARMING THIRD ASSISTANT DIRECTOR IN THE WORLD

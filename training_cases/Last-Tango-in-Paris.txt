ULTIMO TANGO A PARIGI 
[LAST TANGO IN PARIS] 
Written by 
Bernardo Bertolucci & Franco Arcalli 
FINAL SHOOTING TRANSCRIPT 
FADE IN: 
EXT. PARIS FRANCE - PONT DE BIR-HAKEIM - DAY 
PAUL (50's) stands on the street under a RAISED TRAIN BRIDGE. He covers his ears in UTTER DISGUST at the UNBEARABLE NOISE a train makes as it ROARS OVERHEAD. 
He BELLOWS TO THE HEAVENS. 
PAUL (ENGLISH) FUCKING GOD!!!! 
As the train moves on he walks, slowly, DESPONDENT. Lost in a private WORLD OF PAIN. 
Behind him we see a woman in a fur collard coat and flowered hat walking, gaining on him. This is JEANNE (20's). 
As she PASSES Paul, she turns to GLANCE at him. We read a HINT of EMPATHY on her face. 
He is OBLIVIOUS to her or anything else for that matter. 
She walks on, dodging STREET SWEEPERS as she covers the long walkway, trying to forget the SAD MAN she saw. 
We see her walk toward a 6 story APARTMENT BUILDING. 
Paul, with TEARS STREAMING DOWN HIS FACE, comes to reality as he also notices the building. He REGARDS it. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. APT. BUILDING - PASSEY - DAY 
Jeanne stands looking at the grandeur of the building at 1 RUE JULES VERNE. She reads a FOR RENT sign on the door frame. She HESITATES but then RINGS THE BELL. She checks her watch. 
She SMILES to herself then descends the nearby stairs. 
She goes into a BAR. 
CUT TO: 
INT. KENNEDY EIFFEL BAR - DAY 
Jeanne comes in and speaks to the BARTENDER. 
DIALOGUE IS IN FRENCH 
JEANNE A phone token, please. 
BARTENDER No tokens. At the end, on the left. 
JEANNE Thank you. 
Jeanne goes to the TELEPHONE/WASHROOM. 
The telephone booth is OCCUPIED. 
As she waits, she watches in disgust as an OLD LADY cleans her DENTURES with a toothbrush and then puts them back in her mouth. 
Jeanne STUDIES her own face in the MIRROR, puffing her cheeks up in judgement. As she does, Paul exits the phone booth, still LOST IN ANGUISH. 
After watching him leave, Jeanne USES THE PAY PHONE. She speaks to her MOM. 
JEANNE (CONT'D) Mama? Yes, it's Jeanne. I've found a flat to rent in Passy. I'm going to see it. 
She puts her foot up on the seat. We see her LONG BOOTS as her SHORT SKIRT hikes up. 
JEANNE (CONT'D) Then I've got to go to the station to met Tom. I promised him. OK, see you later. Bye! 
CUT TO: 
INT. APT. BUILDING - FRONT DESK 
Jeanne talks to THE CRAZY CONCIERGE through a SMALL WINDOW who is SMOKING and has ROLLERS in her hair. 
JEANNE (CONT'D) An armchair by the fireplace would look good. 
PAUL The armchair should go in front of the window. 
JEANNE Are you American? You've got an American accent. 
He gets off the radiator and WANDERS into the next room for SOLITUDE. 
LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS But she has followed him. She OPENS THOSE WINDOWS also. He is forced into ANOTHER ROOM. 
DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
As he studies a WICKER CHAISE LOUNGE, she calls from the other room. 
JEANNE (CONT'D) Are you going to take it? Are you? 
PAUL I don't know. 
She continues to LOOK AROUND. Her CURIOSITY of Paul gets the best of her. She peeks around the corner and watches him SIT IN THE CORNER. 
JEANNE What are you doing? 
She thinks he is VERY ODD as he PLAYS WITH a lamp shade. Nature calls. She heads to the -- 
BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS 
As the PHONE RINGS, she pulls up her skirt and sits on the toilet for a PEE. She looks around. 
She finishes and FLUSHES THE TOILET as the PHONE RINGS ON incessantly. 
LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
The PHONE RINGS on... 
JEANNE (CONT'D) (PERTURBED) Oh la la. Should I answer It or not? Oh... 
DINING ROOM 
They pick up the phone at the SAME TIME. Paul EAVES DROPS 
JEANNE'S VOICE Hello? Hello -- 
PAUL (to the caller) Hello -- Hello. There's no-one here. There's no-one. I don't know. He puts the SMALL LAMP SHADE back. He hangs the receiver on the back of the chaise. Jeanne continues to listen on her end, UNAWARE. 
Paul SNEAKS AROUND THE CORNER. 
LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Jeanne is STARTLED. She hangs up the phone. 
JEANNE So you're going to take it? You've decided? 
PAUL I had already decided. But I'm not sure now. Do you like it? 
She's SPEECHLESS. 
JEANNE I don't know. I shall have to think about it. 
PAUL Think fast. 
He WALKS OFF. 
Jeanne picks her hat off the floor, lost in CONFUSION. 
The front door SLAMS. 
She walks toward the door... 
But Paul didn't really leave. He walks slowly TOWARD HER. 
JEANNE I thought you'd left. 
He STUDIES HER for a moment. He takes her hat and DROPS IT on the ground. He PICKS HER UP in his arms and CARRIES to the window. He puts her down on the window sill. They start MAKING OUT ferociously. 
He RIPS her panty hose, UNDOES HIS ZIPPER and PENETRATES HER. They are lost in ANIMALISTIC SEX as she WRAPS HER legs around him. 
PAUL Ah... Oh, God. 
They KISS SAVAGELY and HIT the floor as THEY CLIMAX TOGETHER. 
CATHERINE I'd have finished by now, but the police wouldn't let me touch anything. They didn't believe it was suicide. 
She WIPES A MIRROR. 
CATHERINE (CONT'D) There was so much blood everywhere. They had fun making me do a reconstruction. "She went there." 
She wipes another GLASS SURFACE. 
CATHERINE (CONT'D) "She came through here." 
She opens the curtain to the SHOWER/TUB. It's INUNDATED with BLOOD. 
CATHERINE (CONT'D) "She opened the curtain." 
She STARES at the blood... It's so much. She uses the SHOWER HEAD to rinse the blood off the tub. 
CATHERINE (CONT'D) I copied all her actions. The guests were awake all night! The hotel was crawling with cops! They enjoy playing around with blood. She rinses the blood FROM HER HANDS AND ARMS. 
CATHERINE (CONT'D) They were all spies! Asking if she was sad, if she was happy, if you fought, how long you'd been married, why you didn't have any children. Pigs! 
Disgusted and exhausted, she sits on the edge of the tub. We switch to PAUL'S SIDE of the PRIVACY SCREEN. We see he is DEEPLY DISTURBED by this situation. 
CATHERINE (CONT'D) They got familiar right away! They said, "Your boss is a bit unstable." "Do you know that he was a boxer?" So? (MORE) CATHERINE (CONT'D) "It didn't work out, so he became an actor." "Bongo player, revolutionary in South America, journalist in Japan." 
She begins to clean blood from THE STRAIGHT RAZOR Paul's wife used to KILL HERSELF WITH. 
CATHERINE (CONT'D) One day, he lands in Tahiti, hangs around, Learns French." "Then he comes to Paris. There... he meets a woman with money, marries her and... "Since then what has your boss done?" "Nothing." 
Paul pulls the curtains aside from the window. He looks out. He SPIES a BLACK COUPLE, one a SAX PLAYER, in an adjacent building. She is attempting ORAL SEX on him. 
CATHERINE (CONT'D) I say, "Can I clean up now?" "No! Don't touch anything!" "Do you really think she killed herself?" He pushed me into a corner and tried to paw me... 
When the couple are spotted, they stop. He starts PLAYING HIS SAX. 
Paul has had enough of the running water and her cleaning. 
PAUL Turn the tap off now. CATHERINE They'll be doing the autopsy right now. 
Paul walks to her side. 
PAUL Why won't you turn the tap off? 
CATHERINE They told me to give you your razor back. 
She hands him the STRAIGHT RAZOR. He STUDIES IT. 
PAUL It's not mine. 
CATHERINE They said they don't need it any more. The investigation is over. 
He grabs her hands VIOLENTLY and studies them. 
CATHERINE (CONT'D) Yes, she had cuts there... 
He tilts her head back FORCEFULLY. 
CATHERINE (CONT'D) ... and on the neck, too... 
He PULLS HER OUT OF THE WAY and turns off the water. He pulls the SHOWER CURTAIN closed. 
He storms out of the bathroom, leaving Catherine there. 
When he is gone, she opens the curtain and turns the water back on OUT OF SPITE. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. PONT DE BIR-HAKEIM - DAY 
Formerly known as the Passy Viaduct. We see a great shot of the DOUBLE-DECKER ROAD-AND-RAIL BRIDGE and PAUL'S NEW APARTMENT BUILDING. 
CUT TO: 
INT. APT. BUILDING - DAY The front door opens and Jeanne's hand comes in, holding the KEY. 
The rest of her peeks in. She SPIES A CAT. She decides to make CRAZY NOISES at the animal, CRAWLING ON THE FLOOR, making it RUN FOR THE HILLS. 
Just then, MOVERS pop in carrying furniture catching Jeanne off guard. 
MOVER Excuse me, where shall I put this? 
JEANNE (CONT'D) Look, sir! I've got to go! 
BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
She walks across the mattresses with her BOOTS ON. Paul leans against the wall STUDYING THE ROOM. 
PAUL The bed is too big for the room. 
JEANNE I don't know what to call you. 
PAUL I don't have a name. 
JEANNE Do you want to know mine? 
PAUL No, no! I don't. I don't want to know your name. 
He COVERS HER MOUTH and backs her up agianst a WALL. 
PAUL (CONT'D) You don't have a name and I don't have a name either. Not one name. She THROWS HIS HAND off and puts some space between them. 
JEANNE You're crazy! 
She leans against the adjacent wall. 
PAUL Maybe I am, but I don't want to know anything about you. I don't wanna know where you live or where you come from. I wanna know nothing, nothing, nothing... 
JEANNE You scare me. 
Back to the OTHER WALL. 
PAUL You and I are gonna meet here without knowing anything that goes on outside here. 
He indicates OUTSIDE THE WINDOW. 
PAUL (CONT'D) OK? 
JEANNE But why? 
PAUL Because... Because we don't need names here. Don't you see? We're gonna forget... everything that we knew. Every... All the people,... all that we do,... wherever we live. We're going to forget that, everything, everything. 
JEANNE But I can't. Can you? 
PAUL I don't know. Are you scared? 
JEANNE No. 
She walks to the bed, inviting him with her eyes. 
JEANNE (CONT'D) Come? CUT TO: 
INT. HOTEL - PAUL AND ROSA'S ROOM - DAY 
ROSA'S MOTHER roots through Paul and Rosa's belongings. Searching for answers... and maybe some tokens of her DECEASED DAUGHTER. 
Paul WAITS, listening in the HALLWAY. He loathes the upcoming reunion. 
ANNOYED by all the RATTLING while she searches, he bites the bullet and GOES IN. 
He CATCHES her in the ARMOIRE... 
She stops her ROOTING. 
ROSA'S MOTHER I thought you'd be here. 
PAUL I expected you later. 
ROSA'S MOTHER I took the first train. 
We notice the IRONY of the SIGN ON THE DOOR, it reads "PRIVY" (PRIVATE). 
ROSA'S MOTHER (CONT'D) Oh, Paul! How awful! How awful, Paul! 
She walks TIMIDLY up to Paul. After a moment, they EMBRACE each other in a GRIEF STRICKEN HUG. 
MOMENTS LATER 
Paul grows BORED of the reunion, he TAPS HIS FINGERS on the closet he LEANS AGAINST, studying the accessories of the DECOR and her silly hat. 
She sits, SPILLING HER GRIEF on Paul as if it is a THERAPY SESSION. 
ROSA'S MOTHER (CONT'D) I already had some announcement cards. I've seen a lot of death. I think of everything. I'll prepare her a beautiful room with flowers. 
PAUL The cards, clothes, relatives, flowers. You've got everything in that suitcase. You didn't forget anything. But I don't want any priests here. 
ROSA'S MOTHER But... 
PAUL No priests. 
ROSA'S MOTHER But Paul... 
PAUL Understand? 
ROSA'S MOTHER We have to. Funerals must be religious. 
Paul EXPLODES -- She jumps a foot back. 
PAUL No!!! 
He DARES HER with his eyes, ENRAGED. 
PAUL (CONT'D) Rosa didn't believe! Nobody believes in the fucking God here! 
He throws her suitcase AGAINST THE WALL. ROSA'S MOTHER Paul, don't shout. Don't talk like that. 
He SNATCHES THE PAPER from her hands. 
PAUL The priest doesn't want any suicides. The Church doesn't want any suicides, do they? 
ROSA'S MOTHER They'll give her absolution. 
He RAISES HIS HAND threatening to HIT HER. 
PAUL Heh!? 
Scared, she pushes on. 
ROSA'S MOTHER Absolution and a nice mass. That's all I ask, Paul. Rosa... Rosa is my little girl, do you understand? Rosa... Why did she kill herself? 
She starts WEEPING. 
PAUL Why? Why did she commit suicide? Why? 
He PUMMELS THE DOOR with his fists ... ENRAGED... 
PAUL (CONT'D) You don't know? You don't know. 
He closes her DOOR. 
HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 
Some of the OTHER GUESTS pop their heads out to see what the COMMOTION IS. He gently CLOSES THEIR DOORS in a "mind your own business" sort of way. 
There is always the "Miss know it all, busybody type" though. 
She sheepishly REOPENS HER DOOR. 
Paul walks calmly back to it and SLAMS IT in her face --- IRATE. 
CUT TO: 
INT. APT. BUILDING - DAY 
Jeanne enters the ALREADY OPEN DOOR. She looks around the still sparsely furnished living room. 
LIVING ROOM - 
Paul has decided his BED FITS BETTER in here. The BOTTOM MATTRESS is on the floor in the MIDDLE OF THE ROOM. He LEANS AGAINST THE WALL and top mattress, WAITING FOR JEANNE. He knew she'd be there. 
She TAKES A SEAT on the bottom mattress and takes off her boots. 
He watches her and does the same with his shoes. KICKING THEM OFF and CATCHING THEM in the air PLAYFULLY. 
LATER 
Paul and Jeanne sit NUDE, entwined, WRAPPED AROUND EACH OTHERS BODY'S. 
DIALOGUE IS ENGLISH 
PAUL OOh... Now... Let's... Let's just look at each other. 
OLYMPIA'S VOICE Dogs are worth more than people. Much more. 
Jeanne smiles, FAMILIAR. 
JEANNE Meet Olympia, my nanny. 
OLYMPIA Mustapha could always tell the poor from the rich. (MORE) OLYMPIA (CONT'D) If someone well-dressed came in, he never stirred. But if someone scruffy came in, you should have seen him! What a dog! The colonel trained him to recognise Arabs by their scent. 
JEANNE Olympia, open the front door. 
OLYMPIA Give me a kiss. 
Jeanne stands and KISSES HER on the cheek through the gate. 
JEANNE Go and open it. (TO TOM) Olympia is a compendium of domestic virtues. Faithful, admiring, and racist. 
We watch Olympia walk to the MANOR HOUSE as Jeanne WAXES NOSTALGIC. Slowly, the rest of the property is revealed to us. 
JEANNE'S VOICE After Papa died, we moved back to the family home for a while. My childhood was made up of smells. Musty smells, the smell of walls and rooms. 
A GROUP OF KIDS runs into the yard. Children used to come and play in my jungle, all day long. Growing old is a crime. 
CUT TO: 
INT. JEANNE'S FAMILY COUNTRY MANOR 
Jeanne holds up a PICTURE. She points to people as she describes them. 
JEANNE That's me there. And that's Mademoiselle Sauvage, the teacher. She was very strict... and very religious. 
Olympia CHIMES IN AGAIN from behind the CAMERA CREW. 
OLYMPIA She was too good. She spoilt you. 
The Camera Crew turns the camera on her. Jeanne has a DIFFERENT PICTURE, pointing again. 
JEANNE That's Christine... 
They turn back to Jeanne. 
JEANNE (CONT'D) ...my best friend. She married the pharmacist and has two children. It's like a village here. We all know each other. 
Olympia chimes in again from behind, in an open door. 
OLYMPIA I couldn't live in Paris. 
The camera turns on her, then back to Jeanne. 
JEANNE We're safe here. It's odd looking at the past. 
TOM Cut! 
He walks to her. 
TOM (CONT'D) Why is it odd? It's you! It's fantastic, it's your childhood. It's everything I was looking for. 
He turns on his camera crew who is UNDER HIS HEELS, shewing them out. 
TOM (CONT'D) What are you up to? Move it! Move it! (to the lead crewman) Who are these zombies who are always following you around? (to all of them) Scoot! Go on! The door, the door... 
He starts opening all the doors in the MANOR. 
TOM (CONT'D) I'm opening the door. I'm opening all the doors. 
JEANNE What are you doing? 
TOM Setting up my shot. There it is! That's it! I've found it. Reverse gear! 
Olympia is loitering in one of the rooms he comes in. Imagine her nerve, in her own house! 
Tom is the typical RUDE FRENCH DIVA DIRECTOR. 
TOM (CONT'D) What are you doing there? Beat it! 
He turns his attention back to Jeanne, the subject of his OBSESSION. 
TOM (CONT'D) That's it. Into reverse. Yes! Do you see? Like a car, you go into reverse gear. That's it. Close your eyes. 
She closes her eyes. He guides her BACKWARDS by the shoulders through the MANOR. 
JEANNE Aren't my trees beautiful? They were my jungle. 
They come upon the CROWD OF KIDS again. One KID is squatting behind some thatch, doing his business. 
JEANNE (CONT'D) What are you doing? 
KID 1 Having a shit. 
The boy pooping stops and PULLS UP HIS PANTS. 
KID 2 No, we're doing a poo. 
Jeanne SCOLDS THEM. 
JEANNE Shame on you, doing it in my jungle! 
KID 1 Watch out! 
KID 2 Run for it! 
They SCATTER towards the STONE WALL with Olympia and Crew CHASING AFTER THEM. 
OLYMPIA Oh, these dirty little Arabs! Go and shit in your own country! 
The kids CLIMB THE WALL for escape from the CRAZY ADULTS. 
TOM Keep filming. Keep filming! Don't stop, whatever you do! 
Tom wanders back over to Jeanne while Olympia and the Crew continue to SCARE OFF THE KIDS in the b.g.. 
JEANNE Did you get it? 
TOM Everything. 
JEANNE Olympia was great. It'll give a good idea of race relations in the suburbs of Paris. 
TOM It's a real jungle here. So, tell me about your father. 
JEANNE I thought we'd finished. 
TOM Five minutes. 
JEANNE I'm meeting someone for work. 
TOM But the colonel... the colonel! But Jeanne is OFF. 
AND WE CUT TO-- 
CUT TO: 
INT. APT. BUILDING - LIVING ROOM - DAY 
We are back at Paul's new place. Jeanne WANDERS THE ROOM TOPLESS but covering her breasts with a PILLOW. 
She continues to WAX NOSTALGIC about her father. 
JEANNE The colonel had green eyes and shiny boots. I worshipped him. He was so handsome in his uniform. 
PAUL'S VOICE What a steaming pile of horseshit. 
JEANNE What? 
Pissed, she THROWS THE PILLOW she was covering her AMPLE BREAST with at Paul. 
We now see Paul is LOUNGING ON HIS MATTRESS, pant legs rolled up past his knees, TOYING WITH A HARMONICA and drinking from a WOODEN CUP. 
JEANNE (CONT'D) What? Don't... 
PAUL All uniforms are bullshit. Everything outside this place is bullshit. Besides, I don't want to hear about your stories, about your past, and all that. 
JEANNE He died in Algeria in 58... 
PAUL Or 68 or 28 or 98... 
JEANNE 58, and don't joke about things like that. 
PAUL Listen, why don't you stop talking about things that don't matter here? What the hell's the difference? 
DIALOGUE SWITCHES TO ENGLISH 
JEANNE Peanuts? 
Jeanne SMILES ON as Paul reels off a list of FOREIGN NAMES for the MALE GENITALIA. 
PAUL Schlong. Wienerwurst. Cazzo. Bitte. Prick! Joint! 
Jeanne gets a kick out of this... Sort of. 
JEANNE It's funny. It's like playing grown- ups when you're little. I feel like a child again here. 
PAUL Did you have fun as a kid? 
JEANNE It's the most beautiful thing. 
PAUL It's beautiful to be made into a tattletale or forced to admire authority or sell yourself for a piece of candy. 
JEANNE I wasn't like that. 
PAUL No? 
JEANNE I was writing poems. I was drawing castles,... big castles with tower. A lot of tower. 
PAUL Did you ever think about sex? 
JEANNE No. No sex. 
Paul MOCKS HER. 
PAUL "No. No sex." 
JEANNE Tower. 
He gives her a LOVE SMACK on the head. 
PAUL You were probably in love with your teacher. 
JEANNE My teacher was a woman. 
PAUL And she was a lesbian. 
JEANNE How did you know? 
PAUL That's classical... Anyway... 
JEANNE My first love was my cousin Paul. 
Paul explodes. 
PAUL No! I'm gonna get a hemorrhoid if you keep telling me names. No names. I don't mind if you tell the truth, but don't give me the names. 
JEANNE Sorry. Sorry. 
PAUL Well, go on. Tell the truth. What else? 
JEANNE I was ... He was dark, very thin. I can see him. Big nose! A big romance. I fell in love with him when I heard him playing piano. 
PAUL You mean when he first got into your knickers. 
JEANNE He was a child prodigy. He was playing with both hands. 
PAUL I'll bet he was... Probably getting his kicks. 
JEANNE We were dying of heat. 
PAUL Oh, yeah. Good excuse. What else? 
JEANNE In the afternoon, when the grown- ups were napping... 
PAUL You started grabbing his joint. 
JEANNE You're crazy! 
PAUL Well, he touched you. 
JEANNE I never let him! Never! 
PAUL Ohhhh. Liar, liar, pants on fire, nose as long as a telephone wire. 
JEANNE No, I'm not. 
PAUL (CONT'D) What's that? What's all this? 
PAUL (CONT'D) Mad? 
He throws her over his shoulder. He SPINS HER AROUND. She screams but goes with it. 
PAUL (CONT'D) Mad? Mad? Mad? 
She LOVES IT. He puts her down on the sink. She is LAUGHING. 
PAUL (CONT'D) I think I'm happy with you. 
He leaves the bathroom. She slaps the sink top, CHILDLIKE. 
JEANNE Again! Do it again! Again! 
CUT TO: 
INT. APT. BUILDING - FRONT DOOR - A LITTLE LATER 
Paul is all dressed. He is ready to leave. We hear Jeanne from the BATHROOM. 
DIALOGUE IS FRENCH 
JEANNE'S VOICE I'm coming! I'm ready. 
She comes around the corner... 
JEANNE Shall we leave together? 
... Just in time for Paul to SLAM THE DOOR IN HER FACE. 
JEANNE (CONT'D) Bastard! He's a git! Not even goodbye! 
She THROWS HER PURSE at the door. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SUBWAY STATION - PLATFORM - DAY 
A train enters the station. Tom gets off. He searches for Jeanne. 
When the Train leaves, we see her sitting on a bench on the adjacent track. 
She notices him first. 
JEANNE Tom! 
TOM Jeanne! What are you doing there? I'm coming! I'll fly! 
He starts RUNNING TO THE EXIT. 
JEANNE Wait! I've got to talk to you. 
TOM Why didn't you speak on the phone? What's up? 
JEANNE You must find someone else. 
TOM For what? 
JEANNE For your film. 
TOM Why. 
He FRAMES HER with his fingers. JEANNE Because you're taking advantage of me! Because you make me do things I've never done! Because you're taking up my time! You make me do whatever you want! The film is over! 
A train ROARS into the station between them. Jeanne is ANNOYED. 
JEANNE (CONT'D) I'm tired of being raped! 
The train is gone, but there is no one there... Tom is GONE. 
Jeanne walks toward the EXIT. Tom appears on HER SIDE of the platform. 
They STALK EACH other like ANIMALS. He SLAPS HER HARD in the head. She SLAPS him back. 
They FIGHT until she collapses from exhaustion in his arms. 
CUT TO: 
PAUL Our room is painted white. Rosa wanted it to be different from the other rooms in the hotel. 
Marcel takes some LIPS SALVE from his bathrobe pocket. 
PAUL (CONT'D) To make it look like... a more normal home. But... it had to be changed here, too. I think she started with the wall. 
Paul takes notice of the LIP SALVE operation. 
MARCEL A cold sore. I don't know. Shit. 
Paul regards him for a second. 
PAUL You're lucky huh? You were... You must have been very handsome 20 years ago. 
MARCEL Not as much as you. 
PAUL You've still got all your hair. 
MARCEL My hair... I have to have it trimmed often. And wash it. I wash it nearly every day. 
PAUL Don't you have massages? 
He massages his own temples. MARCEL Yes, I do. 
PAUL You're in good shape. 
He paws at Marcel's stomach. 
PAUL (CONT'D) What do you do for... your stomach? That's my problem. 
MARCEL For that... 
He gazes across the room. 
MARCEL (CONT'D) I have a secret. 
He gets up and heads across the room. 
PAUL Tell me! 
He takes a bar from the floor and slides it into a spot on the top of a DOOR FRAME. 
PAUL (CONT'D) Ah... 
MARCEL Are you leaving us? I saw your suitcase was packed. Ah... America. Why was she unfaithful to you? 
PAUL You can't believe that Rosa... killed herself. It's hard for me to... believe, too. 
While Paul has a moment of REFLECTION, Marcel shows him his PULL-UP LEG KICK combo on his PULL-UP bar. 
MARCEL This is my secret! Thirty times every morning. 
Paul leaves, DISGUSTED. 
PAUL (ENGLISH) Really, Marcello, I wonder what she ever saw in you. CUT TO: 
INT. APT. BUILDING - DAY 
Jeanne comes in carrying her FUR COLLARED COAT, purse and a BAG. 
JEANNE Are you in? 
She looks around the place. 
JEANNE (CONT'D) Is anyone here? 
She kicks the door shut with her foot. She wanders to the... 
DINING ROOM 
JEANNE (CONT'D) Hi, monster. 
She throws her coat and purse on the table. She puts a PORTABLE RECORD PLAYER in the BASSINET. 
JEANNE (CONT'D) Is something wrong? 
From the other room we hear Paul... 
PAUL'S VOICE There's butter in the kitchen. 
JEANNE No. 
TOM Yes. 
JEANNE No! 
TOM Yes. 
JEANNE Yes? TOM Yes. 
JEANNE No. 
TOM Yes. 
JEANNE Yes? 
TOM No. Are we getting married or not? 
JEANNE I don't know. 
TOM So, yes, then? 
JEANNE Yes! 
TOM No! 
JEANNE Yes! 
TOM Yes. 
JEANNE No. 
TOM Yes or no? 
She take the life preserver off and THROWS IT IN THE WATER. Together, they WATCH IT SINK. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. JEANNE'S MOTHERS APT. - PORCH - DAY 
JEANNE'S MOTHER beats the dirt off her LATE HUSBANDS MILITARY JACKET. 
JEANNE'S MOTHER Of course, I'll send everything to the country. What do you think, Jeanne? 
INT. LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS 
Jeanne tries on another of her FATHERS MILITARY UNIFORMS complete with HAT. 
JEANNE Olympia will be happy. I went there yesterday with Tom. 
Her mother joins her inside. She carries the FATHERS BOOTS. 
JEANNE (CONT'D) She's preparing a family museum. 
JEANNE'S MOTHER Of course, I'm not sending the boots. I'm keeping them with me. I get strange shivers when I touch them. 
Jeanne goes into an ADJOINING ROOM while her mom continues reflecting, IRONING the JACKET. 
JEANNE'S MOTHER (CONT'D) All these military things never age. 
She looks up just in time to see that Jeanne has found her fathers gun and is pointing it in her direction. 
JEANNE When I was little, it seemed really heavy when Papa taught me how to shoot. 
JEANNE'S MOTHER I'm keeping that here. In a respectable household, it's useful to have a weapon. 
JEANNE You don't even know how to use it. 
JEANNE'S MOTHER The important thing is to have one. It makes an impression. 
JEANNE You really kept everything of Papa's. 
She shows her mom a picture she has scrounged up from her FATHERS WALLET of a TOPLESS NEGRO FEMALE. 
JEANNE (CONT'D) Who's that? His orderly? 
JEANNE'S MOTHER A fine example of a Berber. 
JEANNE Oh. 
TOM What are they selling? Cars. Tinned meat. Cigarettes. 
JEANNE No. They're all about young couples. Before marriage, no children. Then the same couple, married with children. In short, marriage. The perfect, ideal, successful marriage. It's no longer the preserve of the Church. The husband was burdened with responsibilities and the wife nagged. Now, weddings in advertising smile! 
TOM They smile. On posters. 
JEANNE On posters, of course. But why t take poster marriage seriously? Marriage... Pop marriage! 
Tom comes out from under a DRESS. 
TOM Pop? That's the formula. For pop youth, pop marriage! But... what if the pop marriage doesn't work? 
JEANNE Then you have to fix it like you would a car. The spouses are two workers in overalls bending over an engine to fix it. 
TOM And in case of adultery what happens to the pop marriage? 
JEANNE In that case, there are three or four workers. 
TOM What about love? Is love pop? 
JEANNE No. That's not. Love isn't pop. 
TOM Love isn't pop. So what is it? 
JEANNE The workers retire to a secret flat, take off their overalls and become men and women again and make love. 
The fussing on the dress is finished. Jeanne slowly, PUTS ON HER GLOVES, relishing them. 
She STRUTS slowly for all to stare and LAVISH her in her dress. 
Tom is CAPTIVATED. 
TOM You're wonderful. 
JEANNE It's the dress that makes the bride. 
TOM You're better than Rita Hayworth. 
He wanders out into the street. It is RAINING HEAVILY. 
Better than Joan Crawford! Better than Kim Novak! Better than Lauren Bacall! Better than Ava Gardner when she was Mickey Rooney's lover! 
Hes FILM CREW scatters for cover. 
TOM (CONT'D) What are you doing? Stop! Stop, but keep filming! Why aren't you filming in the rain? 
CREW 1 You're crazy! 
They huddle underneath the DOOR of the FILM TRUCK. 
Tom has lost Jeanne in all the HUBUB. He is disgusted with his CREW. 
TOM You're all fired! 
He goes back to the SHOP. 
TOM (CONT'D) Where's Jeanne? 
DRESSER 1 She must have run off. 
TOM When? ln the rain? 
He runs down the street in the rain looking for her. 
JEANNE Jeanne! Jeanne! Jeanne! Jeanne!

Paul comes POINDING in from the rain. He STOMPS the water off his shoes. He breaks into an IMPROMPTU SOFT SHOE. 
He opens the gate to the ELEVATOR and gets on. He pushes the button. The elevator STARTS UP. JEANNE'S VOICE Please forgive me! 
Paul stops the elevator. He SENDS IT BACK DOWN. 
We see Jeanne has been waiting on the ADJACENT STAIRS for Paul. She is still in her WEDDING DRESS. 
She implores Paul from outside the elevator. 
He really leaves this time. 
PAUL'S VOICE Rat's asshole with mayonnaise! 
He LAUGHS at himself. 
Jeanne is a BASKET CASE. She sits on her HAUNCHES, muttering. 
JEANNE I want to get out of here. I want to go. I can't stand it here any more. Yes. I'm going. 
She gets up, gets her purse and goes to the door. We see her ASS through the SHEER FABRIC of her wedding dress. 
JEANNE (CONT'D) I'm not coming back... ever. 
She gets to the... 
FRONT DOOR Paul is there, WAITING, NONCHALANT. 
PAUL Quo vadis, baby? 
JEANNE I forgot to tell you something. I fell in love with somebody. 
PAUL Oh, isn't that wonderful? You know, you're going to have to get out of these wet duds. 
He PATS HER ASS. 
JEANNE I'm going to make love with him! 
She opens the door but he closes it. She STOMPS into the HALL. 
PAUL Well, first you have to take a hot bath. Cos if you don't... 
He walks toward her. 
PAUL (CONT'D) ...you're gonna get pneumonia, right? Huh? 
She STOMPS a few more steps toward the BATHROOM. 
PAUL (CONT'D) And then you know what happens? You get pneumonia, then you know what happens? You die. And then, you know what happens when you die? I get to fuck the dead rat! 
He THROWS HER OVER his shoulder and carries her KICKING AND SCREAMING into the...

INT. BATHROOM 
Jeanne is in the BATHTUB. Paul sits on the BIDET behind her with a WASHCLOTH. 
PAUL Give me the soap. She does. 
JEANNE I'm in love. 
PAUL You're in love? 
He shoves her head UNDER THE WATER. 
PAUL (CONT'D) How delightful. 
She comes up ANGRY. 
JEANNE I'm in love! I'm in love, you understand? 
He SMACKS her with the washcloth on the head. 
JEANNE (CONT'D) I'm in love, I'm in love! 
He SHOVES HER under again. 
JEANNE (CONT'D) Oh! I'm in love! 
He HITS HER on the head with her own shoe. She just gets more ANGRY. 
JEANNE (CONT'D) You know, you're old! You're getting fat. 
PAUL Fat, is it? How unkind. 
JEANNE Half of your hair is out and the other half is almost white. 
He smacks her in the mouth with the wash cloth, she smiles. 
JEANNE That's it. 
He stands FACING the wall and PULLS HIS pants down. 
PAUL I want you to put your fingers up my ass. 
JEANNE What? 
PAUL Put your fingers up my ass, are you deaf? Go on. I'm gonna get a pig... and I'm... I'm gonna have the pig fuck you. (MORE) PAUL (CONT'D) I want the pig to vomit in your face and I want you to swallow the vomit. Are you gonna do that for me? 
JEANNE Yeah. 
PAUL Huh? 
JEANNE Yeah! 
PAUL I want the pig to die while... while you're fucking him. Then you'll have to go behind him. I want you to smell the dying farts of the pig. Are you gonna do all of that for me? 
JEANNE Yes, and more than that! And worse! And worse than before.

INT. HOTEL - TEMPORARY VIEWING ROOM - DAY 
ROSA'S WAKE. Rosa's mother has set up a room in the Hotel as a VIEWING ROOM for her daughter. She is, as promised, surrounded by TONS OF FLOWERS. Paul comes in and pulls up a chair next to ROSA. He turns on the LIGHT. 
PAUL You look ridiculous in that make- up. Like the caricature of a whore. A little touch of Mommy in the night. Fake Ophelia drowned in the bathtub. I wish you could see yourself. You'd really laugh. You're your mother's masterpiece. 
He pulls the chair closer to her. 
PAUL (CONT'D) Oh Christ! There are too many fucking flowers in this place. I can't breathe. You know on the top of the closet? (MORE) PAUL (CONT'D) The cardboard box, I found all your... I found all your little goodies. Pens, keychains, foreign money, French ticklers, the whole shot. Even a clergyman's collar. I didn't know you collected all those little knick-knacks left behind. Even if the husband lives fucking years, he's never going to be able to discover his wife's real nature. I mean, I... I might be able to comprehend the universe, but... 'll never discover the truth bout you. Never. I mean, who the hell were you? Remember that day, the first day I was there? I knew that I couldn't get into your pants unless I said... What did I say? Oh, yeah. "May I have my bill, please? I have to leave." Remember? Last night... I ripped off the lights on your mother. And the whole joint went bananas. All your... guests... as you used to call them... Well, I guess that includes me, doesn't it? It does include me, doesn't it? For five years, I was more a guest in this fucking flophouse than a husband. With privileges, of course. And then, to help me understand you, you let me inherit Marcel. The husband's double, whose room was the double of ours. And you know what? I didn't even have the guts to ask him. Didn't have the guts to ask him if the same numbers you and I did were the same numbers you did with him. Our marriage was nothing more than a foxhole for you. And all it took for you to get out was a -cent razor and a tub full of water. You cheap, goddamn, fucking, godforsaken whore. I hope you rot in hell. You're worse than the dirtiest street pig anybody could find, and you know why? You know why? Because you lied. You lied to me and I trusted you. You lied. You knew you were lying! Go on, tell me you didn't lie. Haven't you got anything to say about that? You can think up something, can't you? (MORE) PAUL (CONT'D) Go on, tell me something! Smile, you cunt! 
He STARTS to WEEP. 
PAUL (CONT'D) Go on, tell me... Tell me something sweet. Smile at me and say I just misunderstood. Go on, tell me. You pig-fucker! You goddamn, fucking, pig-fucking liar. Rosa, I'm sorry... I just can't... I can't stand it... to see these goddamn things on your face. You never wore make-up. This fucking shit. I'm gonna take this off your mouth. This lipstick... Rosa... Oh, God! 
He COLLAPSES on her, SOBBING. 
PAUL (CONT'D) I'm sorry. I don't know why you did it. I'd do it too, if I knew how. I just don't know how. I have to... I have to find a way. 
[OC] We hear a voice. 
PROSTITUTE'S VOICE Is anyone there? 
PAUL What? 
PROSTITUTE'S VOICE There was a noise in there! 
PAUL All right, I'm... I'm coming. (back to ROSA) I have to go. I have to go, sweetheart, baby. Somebody's calling me. 
He starts to the door. 
PROSTITUTE'S VOICE Well? Is anyone there? 
PAUL Yeah. I'm coming.

INT. HOTEL - ENTRANCE - DAY 
Outside the FRONT DOOR, the source of the voice, a WORN OUT and OLD PROSTITUTE. She is with her JOHN. 
PROSTITUTE (TO JOHN) Here he is. (TO PAUL) Hurry up! Wake up! Open up! Open up! 
PAUL It's four in the morning. 
PROSTITUTE I need room four for a while. (TO JOHN) Half an hour? (TO PAUL) Yes, that'll do. Yes, half an hour. 
PAUL We're full. 
She knocks on the door, INCESANTLY. 
PROSTITUTE That's not true. When you're full, you put a sign outside. I know the hotel. I'm sick of arguing out on the street. Call the owner. What are you waiting for? The owner has never made a fuss. Rosa and I are old friends. Open up. Paul opens up. 
PROSTITUTE (CONT'D) Don't make any trouble or I'll tell your boss. (TO JOHN) Come in, it's all sorted... 
But the man has LEFT. 
PROSTITUTE (CONT'D) You've won. He's taken off. 
JEANNE Where did they take the furniture too? It's empty. Where do you send his mail? Give me his address. 
CONCIERGE I don't have it. I don't know these people. 
JEANNE Not even his name? 
CONCIERGE Nothing! 
Jeanne STORMS OUT. 
CONCIERGE (CONT'D) Ma'zelle!

Jeanne is on the payphone in the bar from before. She speaks to Tom. Still DESPONDENT, tears stream down her face. 
JEANNE I've found a flat for us. 1 rue Jules Verne. Yes. In Passy. Come quickly! You'll come now? Do you know where it is? I'll wait for you. Come over. 
She struggles to HANG UP THE PHONE through her grief. She BREAKS DOWN, closing the door for privacy. 
We can SEE HER through the door as she leans on it. 
CUT TO: 
INT. APT. BUILDING - LIVING ROOM - DAY 
The front DOORBELL RINGS. 
JEANNE Come in, it's open. 
Tom comes in. Jeanne stares out the window. She is BATHED in sunlight. 
Tom LOOKS AROUND in b.g. 
JEANNE (CONT'D) Do you like our flat? It's very light. There's a tiny room, too. It's too small for a double bed. It would be fine for a child. Fidel. That's a nice name for a boy. Fidel, as in Castro. 
TOM But I'd like a girl, too. Rosa. As in Rosa Luxemburg. Less famous, but I like it. You know, I wanted to film you every day. In the morning, when you wake up, in the evening, when you sleep. When you first smile, and I didn't film any of that. Here. He hands her FLOWERS. She REGARDS them. 
He circles to her front. 
TOM (CONT'D) Today is the last day of shooting. The film is finished. I don't like things that finish, things that end. You have to start something else right away. 
They EMBRACE and KISS. 
THAT ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Tom looks around the place. 
TOM (CONT'D) This flat is huge! 
Jeanne has made her way to the DINING ROOM. 
TOM (CONT'D) Where are you? 
JEANNE I'm here! 
They continue shouting across the apt. 
TOM It's too big! We'll get lost! 
JEANNE Stop it! Don't start! 
TOM How did you find this flat? 
JEANNE By chance. 
TOM We'll change everything! 
Jeanne holds her ARMS OUT like a bird. 
JEANNE Everything! We'll change chance to destiny. 
TOM Go on, Jeanne. Take off! 
MUSIC RISES as Jeanne pretends to FLY AROUND the apt. from ROOM TO ROOM making AIRPLANE NOISES as Tom DIRECTS HER. 
TOM (CONT'D) Fly away, you're in heaven! You're soaring, you're in heaven! Come down, take a nose dive, come down! Make three turns, come down. Jeanne, what's happening? There's an air pocket. 
The JURY IS in an UPROAR. The tango President FREAKS OUT. 
PRESIDENT That's the limit! What are you doing? 
They LIE ON THE FLOOR... They get back up and FEIGN some TANGO. 
The President comes out on the floor now to them. She GRABS Paul who had DIPPED Jeanne over the JURY TABLE. 
PRESIDENT (CONT'D) You'll have to leave, sir. 
She starts scurrying them off the dance floor. 
PAUL Madame! 'Tis ever love. 
She continues to SHEW THEM AWAY. And she can hold her own against Paul's SMART ASS MOUTH. 
PRESIDENT Go to the circus if you want to see love! Go on! Get out of here! You'll have to leave. 
Paul now GRABS HER and starts spinning and DANCING WITH HER. 
He SWEEPS HER UP into his arms. 
She struggles and Paul puts her down. She continues to SHEW THEM AWAY. PAUL CONTINUES TO MOCK HER. 
PAUL Oh my god, I've never... 
He pulls his pants down and MOONS HER. 
PAUL (CONT'D) Kiss me, sweetheart! 
She is APPALLED and slaps him on the arm as he scoots to the door, Jeanne FOLLOWING. 
PAUL (CONT'D) Farewell, you sweet peach blossom. 
As they get to the door he spins one last time. 
PAUL (CONT'D) I could dance for ever. Oh, my hemorrhoid! 
He LOSES HIS BALANCE and slips. Jeanne has to catch him. 
PAUL (CONT'D) Beauty of mine, sit before me. Let me peruse you and remember you always like this. 
They sit in some tables in a closed, darkened section. Jeanne puts her head down on the table in EXHAUSTION. 
He CLAPS LOUDLY till she wakes up. He puts on his ENGLISH ACCENT AGAIN. 
PAUL (CONT'D) Garcon! Champagne! If music be the food of love, play on. 
Jeanne looks OVER IT ALL. 
PAUL (CONT'D) What's the matter with you? 
JEANNE It's finished. 
She COLLAPSES on the table again. He kisses her head. 
PAUL What's the matter with you? 
JEANNE It's finished! 
He's OBLIVIOUS to her seriousness, AGAIN. 
PAUL What's finished? 
JEANNE We're never going to see each other again. Never! 
PAUL That's ridiculous. 
She shakes her head NO. 
PAUL (CONT'D) That's ridiculous! 
JEANNE It's not a joke. 
PAUL Oh, you dirty rat! 
JEANNE It's finished. 
PAUL Look, when something's finished, it begins again. 
He keeps his distance on the OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE STREET but still doesn't get that SHE IS SERIOUS. She tries to explain it to him. 
JEANNE I'll call the police! 
He BLOWS IT OFF. 
PAUL Aha! I smell the henhouse. 
She needs to GO WHERE HE IS. She starts toward him TIMIDLY. 
PAUL (CONT'D) Well, shit, I'm not in your way. 
He feigns a GRAND GESTURE ushering her free travel. 
PAUL (CONT'D) After you, mademoiselle! 
She TENTATIVELY walks on as he PRETENDS TO ALSO. 
PAUL (CONT'D) So long, sister. Besides, you're a crummy-looking broad. I don't give a damn if I never see you again. Shit. 
She MAKES A BEE - LINE to her MOTHERS APARTMENT BUILDING. 
He TAKES OFF after her.

INT. JEANNE'S MOTHERS APT. - LOBBY

She is SHOCKED, she backs up to the ELEVATOR.

She is becoming HYSTERICAL now. 
JEANNE It's over! 
She makes her way to the

She gets on the OLD FASHIONED LIFT and SLAMS the door in his face. 
She begins to ASCEND. 
He FOLLOWS every floor UP THE STAIRS. 
JEANNE Help! 
She is calling to anyone that can hear as he STALKS HER. 
JEANNE (CONT'D) Help! Help! 
One FLOOR AFTER ANOTHER... 
JEANNE (CONT'D) Please, help! 
He trips and STUMBLES up the STAIRS after her. 
JEANNE (CONT'D) Help! Help! 
Finally at the top, he has to REST against the wall. 
PAUL Oh, man! She MAKES A DASH FOR her moms apartment. 
But HE FOLLOWS. He grabs her as she tries to UNLOCK THE DOOR. 
She runs across to the NEIGHBORS DOOR and BANGS ON IT. 
JEANNE Help! Help me! Help! 
He tries to REASON with her. 
PAUL This is getting ridiculous. 
She sees her chance to get back in her moms. She dashes over and UNLOCKS THE DOOR and flies inside trying to slam the door shut. It's no use, he FORCES HIS WAY IN.

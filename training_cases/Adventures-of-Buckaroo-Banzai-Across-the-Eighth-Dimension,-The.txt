BUCKAROO BANZAI 
CARD OVER...WHITE LETTERS ON A DARK BACKGROUND: 
FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT Classified File #2TC1695 Dept. of Defense 3-1-50 thru 8-31-53 Re:  Project Sawtooth 
FADE IN: 
EXT.  SMALL TEXAS TOWN - DAY	1 
Beside a 1950 Ford, a quartet of elite intellectuals poses playfully...dressed in the local custom of boots and cowboy hats, the TOW ORIENTAL MEN, A CAUCASIAN MAN, AND A CAUCASIAN WOMAN squint into the hot sun and then down at the jiggling home movie camera, the operator lopsided... 
NARRATOR The advent of the Soviet nuclear capability ushers in a dangerous phase of the Cold War as the decade of the 1950s looms.  Stung by this Soviet challenge and the rapid race to develop ever more sophisticated weapons, the United States resurrects maverick Professor Toichi Hikita's work in electromagnetic particle acceleration...despite the dismal record of failure that has dogged the project. 
TOICHI HIKITA, one of the group, walks forward, taking the CAMERA from its present operator, a four-year-old child...A LITTLE BOY IN CHAPS AND COWBOY HAT who now joins the other adults, in particular Caucasian woman and the elder Oriental man who pick him up and hug him... 
NARRATOR Doctor Masado Banzai, preeminent Japanese quantum theorist, declares himself anxious to work for the Allies.  Enamored of the great American West, Banzai sires a precocious son and tags the tiny child "Buckaroo." A tribute to his adopted homeland. 
EXT.  TEST SITE - DAY	2 
A strange TWO-MAN SPEED VEHICLE readies for takeoff...the FIRST "PILOT" in the cockpit Dr. Banzai himself: 
NARRATOR And thus given a second chance after his secret pre-war laboratory disaster at Princeton, Doctor Hikita finds new life at the Texas School of Mines, where he assembles a team of crack scientists willing to gamble he's right in his bold assertion that man can indeed pass unharmed through solid matter. 
The SECOND "PILOT," a fair-haired Caucasian:	3 
NARRATOR Sir Alan Motley of Cambridge, a brainy, affable limey, co-developer with Whitehead and Lord Russell of the world's most advanced theoretical gravity catapult... 
The fourth scientist, the female Caucasian, busy with last-minute details, securing the two pilots in their seats, checking their instrument data, writing on a clipboard... 
NARRATOR Dr. Sandra Banzai, Texas-born pioneer in Negative Mass Propulsion ...wife of Dr. Masado Banzai. 
...as the four-year-old BUCKAROO BANZAI now approaches the speed machine and gives his father a good-bye kiss...Dr. Banzai saying something to the boy, Buckaroo bowing respectfully, as his father and mother exchange last-minute assurances... 
The cockpit canopy comes down, and Sandra Banzai tugs a reluctant little Buckaroo toward a sandbagged shelter... 
EXT.  SANDBAGS - DAY	5 
...where Professor Hikita sits at a bank of monitoring equipment, Sandra Banzai and Buckaroo entering the enclosure as... 
...A SUDDEN NOISE causes Sandra Banzai to turn in fear, the bizarre speed machine's motors whining at an astonishing rpm, BLINDING GREEN FLAMES ENGULFING ITS COCKPIT... 
EXT.  TEST SITE - DAY	6 
...Sandra Banzai rushing toward the sheet-metal vehicle through SMOKE AND GREEN FLAME as her husband and Sir Alan both struggle to get out... 
...Buckaroo running after his mother who attempts to help the scientists free themselves when suddenly the child is thrown to the ground and protected by Professor Hikita's own body...as the experimental car VAPORIZES IN A FLASH OF EMERALD GREEN LIGHT!  THE SCREEN GOING WHITE, A LAUNCH COUNTDOWN BEGINNING UNDER A SOMBER CARD: 
TODAY THIRTY YEARS LATER 
VOICE OF MISSION CONTROL T Minus five hundred and counting.  Phaser positive.  Latch compressor. 
INT.  BLOCKHOUSE - DAY	8 
CLOSE ON AN OLDER, WISER PROFESSOR HIKITA: 
PROF. HIKITA Power source output, zero-zero-niner.  Multi-stage axial compressor latched. 
EXT.  JET CAR - PROVING GROUNDS - DAY	9 
One hundred yards from a concrete blockhouse, a SERIES OF MYSTERIOUS CLOSEUPS of an UNUSUAL STRATEGIC AUTOMOBILE sitting ready to roll, as TECHNICIANS in asbestos suites fill its tanks with HIGHLY FLAMMABLE FUEL. 
INT.  BLOCKHOUSE - DAY	10 
PROF. HIKITA Fuel pressure, 1800 torrs.  Oxygenation. 
...amid television screens, monitoring devices...an elite assortment of GOVERNMENT VIPS, MILITARY MEN, AND NEWS MEDIA REPRESENTATIVES standing by... 
...one such observer, GENERAL CATBURD, an AIDE approaching, whispering unpleasant news in his ear... 
GENERAL CATBURD You're kidding. Where is he?  Still in the hospital? 
The aide shrugging, the General leaning over to a nervous man sitting next to him...SECRETARY OF DEFENSE McKINLEY. 
JEWISH PHYSICIAN Okay...right...okay, I see...next time I'll be able to... 
BUCKAROO BANZAI There may not be a next time. 
JEWISH PHYSICIAN Look...I'm sorry...calling for help in the middle of an operation...but I just lost my nerve...I panicked...again. 
Buckaroo picking a NIKON up off a table, snapping some pictures of his handiwork... 
BUCKAROO BANZAI You've got the God-given tools to be a success in any field of endeavor, Dr. Zwibel.  Ever thought about joining me full-time? 
JEWISH PHYSICIAN (DR. ZWIBEL) Are you serious?  Have you have an opening? 
BUCKAROO BANZAI Can you sing? 
DR. ZWIBEL A little. I can dance. 
Buckaroo glancing at the clock on the wall... 
INT.  BLOCKHOUSE - DAY	22 
PROF. HIKITA Inertial Control positive.  T minus seven zero and resume counting. 
MISSION CONTROL All systems righteous.  Professor Hikita says we have to go. 
General Catburd and other VIPS happy to observe on their TV monitors the sight of a MAN IN BLACK COMMANDO PARACHUTE SUIT, carrying a BATTERED OLD BRIEFCASE, climbing into the cockpit of...THE JET CAR. 
INT.  JET CAR - DAY 
THE DRIVER'S POV, a curious combination of airplane dials and switches and personal touches like a big four-on-the-floor gear shift and a snazzy pearlized Brodi knob with snowflakes and a coochi-coochi girl... 
ANGLE ON the driver as he removes a strange GRYOSCOPIC DEVICE from his briefcase, plugs it into a cradle near his head... 
INT.  BLOCKHOUSE - DAY	25 
Professor Hikita standing at a special monitor as a light pops on, indicating "Overthruster Armed"....he covers it with a hanky... 
EXT.  JET CAR - DAY	26 
...all quiet suddenly, the car poised, waiting... 
INT.  BLOCKHOUSE - DAY	27 
General Catburd grabbing some coffee and doughnuts...the Secretary of Defense peering out through a viewing slot... 
GENERAL CATBURD I've got a budget meeting on the hill, John.  What's this thing supposed to do anyway? 
SENATOR CUNNINGHAM Three hundred miles an hour, General. 
GENERAL CATBURD Senator, you are so fulla shit. 
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE May not... 
EXT.  JET CAR - DAY	28 
The Jet Car undergoing an amazing transformation:  TWO STABILIZER FINS AND A JET ENGINE suddenly appearing on its rear deck... 
INT.  JET CAR - DAY	29 
CLOSE ON THE DRIVER TO REVEAL BUCKAROO BANZAI, world famous figure in every field of endeavor as he withdraws a beautiful KAMIKAZE SCARF from his flight suit...wraps it like a warrior's headband around his helmet... 
ANGLE ON Buckaroo's hand as his fingers flip a row of toggle switches, THE PULSATING POWER OF THE JET ENGINE INCREASING DRAMATICALLY with each successive switch...the vehicle a caged beast, taunting us, as Buckaroo flips the last switch... 
BUCKAROO BANZAI Final contact is made. 
EXT.  JET CAR - DAY	31 
No kidding.  A TWENTY FOOT SHEET OF FIRE ROCKETING FROM THE BACK OF THE JET CAR...THEN ANOTHER...THEN ANOTHER... 
INT.  BLOCKHOUSE - DAY	32 
The Cavaliers at their monitors, calm...Hikita making minor adjustments on his instrument bank...the Secretary of Defense and General Catburd both now at viewing slots in the blockhouse wall... 
PROF. HIKITA Point of no return...five, four, three, two... 
INT.  JET CAR - DAY	33 
PROF. HIKITA'S VOICE ...one. 
As Buckaroo Banzai twists his steering-wheel mounted TWIN ACCELERATORS, the sudden forward lurch of the Jet Car slamming him back against the headrest... 
EXT.  PROVING GROUNDS - DAY	34 
ANCHORWOMAN ON TV Here she is, slowed down.  Lookit there...slam!  Right into the side of that mountain!  Perfect Tommy, Rawhide, Reno, you guys're the Hong Kong Cavaliers. Buckaroo's most trusted inner circle.  So I gotta ask, did it surprise you fellas as much as the rest of us when the BJV, the experimental jet vehicle went right off the scope and apparently smack into a black void? 
PERFECT TOMMY ON TV Nope. 
ANCHORWOMAN ON TV Was Buckaroo acting different this morning, I mean, in terms of other mornings? 
The Cavaliers rolling their eyes, looking at one another... 
RAWHIDE ON TV Well, we partied pretty late last night. 
BACK TO Dr. Lizardo now hearing footsteps outside in the corridor, and HIS LEFT AHND, ACTING INDEPENDENTLY OF HIS RIGHT, ERASES THE EQUATION HE'S JUST WRITTEN...as his right hand reaches under his pillow and picks up a crude HOMEMADE ELECTROMAGNET...a piece of metal wrapped in copper wire, one end of which is a small loop that Lizardo now attaches directly to his thumbs... 
DOCTOR LIZARDO (muttering) The Overthruster! The Overthruster! 
Lizardo looking back at his equation, at first puzzled to find it erased, then becoming angry. 
CLOSE ON HIS HAND NOW STICKING THE OTHER END OF HIS HOME-MADE DEVICE DIRECTLY INTO AN ELECTIRCAL SOCKET... 
ANGLE ON:	93 
DOCTOR LIZARDO (obsessed) The Overthruster! 
ELECTRICAL CURRENT COURSING THROUGH LIZARDO'S BODY...AN AURA SURROUNDING HIM AS HIS LIPS CURL INTO A HIDEOUS SMILE...BURNING THE SCREEN, TAKING US INTO AN ASTOUNDING FLASHBACK SEQUENCE: 
INT.  STRANGE LABORATORY - NIGHT	94 
Forty-six years prior (years before the ill-fated primitive speed car run involving Buckaroo's parents) an unlikely experiment in a strange factory...A RUNWAY...a much younger, dark-haired Doctor Lizardo being strapped into a homemade wicker chair/rocket sled by two LAB ASSISTANTS, the entire contraption set up like a catapult AIMED DIRECTLY AT A LOSID BRICK WALL, THROBBING ELECTROMAGNETS AND BANKS OF GLOWING OSCILLATORS... 
ANOTHER ANGLE...and peering into an unusual periscope, an equally JUVENILE PROFESSOR HIKITA wearing glasses and scraggly goatee...standing in front of a 1938 calendar on the wall, today's eagerly awaited date circled in red... 
PROF. HIKITA Almost ready, Dr. Lizardo...almost... 
Doctor Lizardo pulling on a leather helmet, Professor Hikita nodding grimly at the LAB ASSISTANTS who tug on a GIANT LEVER...the ELECTROMAGNETS PULSATING... 
DOCTOR LIZARDO More!  More! 
PROF. HIKITA Not so fast... 
ANGLE ON Doctor Lizardo pulling a switch, UNLEASHING HIS WICKER CHAIR AT A FANTASTIC SPEED down the rails! 
AT THE END OF THE TRACK...the strange device coming to an abrupt and total stop ten feet from the brick wall, pitching Lizardo forward and... 
...through the wall, at least partially, the seemingly solid bricks turning out to be more like vertical QUICKSAND...Lizardo half in, half out, physically unhurt but screaming his head off... 
...the assistants rushing down the runway to help pry him loose, while Professor Hikita observes an astonishing thing through his periscope. 
PERISCOPE POV:  HUGE GROTESQUE RED CREATURES IN AN AURA OF ELECTRICITY TRYING TO PULL DOCTOR LIZARDO TOWARD THEM...ONE CREATURE IN PARTICULAR ENVELOPING LIZARDO! 
BACK TO...the doctor's assistants frantically tugging on his feet, dragging him back into the room only to find this SUDDENLY ORANGE- HAIRED LIZARDO a fearsome, changed individual...a beast! 
CLOSE ON LIZARDO!  A terrifying scream issues from his mouth as he straightens up, at last wrenching free of the wicker chair, smashing his two assistants' heads together as he jumps over the runway!  Hikita watching wild-eyed as Lizardo makes a mad dash into the vast shadowy expanse of the factory... 
A DISTANT VIEW OF LIZARDO as he rips a door off its hinges, escaping into the night, SILHOUTTED AGAINST A DAZZLING SECURITY LIGHT, THE SCREEN BURNING WHITE...OUR FLASHBACK ENDING. 
INT.  LIZARDO'S ROOM - NIGHT	104 
Nearly half a century later, the elderly Lizardo regards with smoldering evil the turn of the key in his own door and the appearance of a GUARD who comes in and unplugs his TV set. 
GUARD Cheer up, Lizardo, it's Friday.  I come for your TV.  You been using too damn much juice...ten thousand kilowatts again this month.  Beats me how one old homicidal loony could use that much power. 
The guard leaving with Lizardo's TV...Lizardo trying to control himself, his eyes rolling up at the ceiling where yet another UNUSUAL EQUATION has been scrawled in an angry hand. 
DOCTOR LIZARDO I want my TV...don't take my TV...I want it.  I want the Overthruster. I want it. 
INT.  NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT	105 
Mysterious half-light...CLOSEUPS...plugs and jacks...a portion of an upright base...drums with the BANZAI LOGO writ large...hands and feet putting everything together as an unseen audience stirs restlessly... 
INT.  DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT	106 
Backstage in a small dressing room, the rock band known as the Hong Kong Cavaliers waits to go on...three unidentified GROUPIES in attendance as Rawhide naps and Reno tunes his saxophone while Perfect Tommy answers the questions of a FEMALE REPORTER from the local underground press... 
Professor Hikita meantime at a corner table, studying his big notebook, examining a pair of KODAK SLIDES... 
...as there is the sound of a commotion in the corridor, EXCITED VOICES and FOOT TRAFFIC coming this way, Rawhide methodically counting down under his Stetson: 
RAWHIDE Five...four...three...two...one. 
The door to the dressing room opening precisely on the count of one, admitting an out-of-breath and hastily tuxedoed Buckaroo Banzai, A SMALL CROWD OF ASSORTED FEMAL FANS locked outside. 
BUCKAROO BANZAI I'm starving...somebody, help. 
BUCKAROO BANZAI Doubt it.  Check NORAD command.  Could be a volcanic ash cloud.  Work her up statistically, check it for the next twenty-four hours, then shovel the data over to Reno. 
INT.  PASSENGER SECTION/BUS - DAY	135 
Buckaroo coming through another heavy steel door, and for the first time we realize that we just might be on a MOVING BUS... 
EXT.  POLICE STATION - ESTABLISHING - DAY	136 
BUCKAROO'S BUS pulling up...BUCKAROO BANZAI AND THE HONG KONG CAVALIERS emblazoned along its side. 
INT.  POLICE STATION - DAY	137 
Waiting near the watch desk, Buckaroo's Jewish surgeon buddy, Dr. Zwibel...in a thousand-dollars worth of drugstore cowboy gear, a Hoppalong Cassidy hat, red alligator boots, listening to the local COUNTRY STATION on a suitcase size stereo... 
...looking up as Buckaroo, Reno, and Perfect Tommy approach... 
DR. ZWIBEL Howdy, Buckaroo.  Got your message about rendezvousing here.  Barely had time to pack my saddlebags. 
BUCKAROO BANZAI Sid, welcome aboard. (shaking hands) Fellas, meet a medical colleague, Sid Zwibel.  He'll be riding with us from now on, so get acquainted while I snoop around. 
Buckaroo heading over to the DESK SERGEANT on duty... 
RENO The name's Reno.  This here's Perfect Tommy. 
PERFECT TOMMY Where do you hail from, Doc? 
DR. ZWIBEL (catching on) New Jersey! 
RENO NEVADA Where's your spurs at? 
DR. ZWIBEL You making fun of me? 
PERFECT TOMMY Reno, how's about you take New Jersey's gear, mosey on over to the bus and introduce him to the rest of the hands. 
RENO Why me? 
PERFECT TOMMY Cause Buckaroo needs me here. 
Reno picking up Doctor Zwibel's huge stereo and suitcase... 
RENO Follow me, pard'ner. 
INT.  CELL - DAY	138 
Penny sitting on her bunk, a disheveled mess...depressed, her head buried in her hands as Buckaroo arrives.  She sees his reflection in the pitiful mirror above her toilet... 
PENNY PRIDDY What're you doing here? Why're you looking at me like that? 
BUCKAROO BANZAI I guess 'cause you remind me of someone I once knew, long ago before any of this craziness. 
PENNY PRIDDY Go away.  Let me rot? 
BUCKAROO BANZAI Who were you really trying to kill last night? 
PENNY PRIDDY You.  Like the papers all say. 
BUCKAROO BANZAI Pretty terrible shot. 
Silence.  Penny realizing you don't fool this man with the sloppy bowtie...coming over to the bars... 
PENNY PRIDDY Was she pretty? 
BUCKAROO BANZAI Who? 
PENNY PRIDDY The girl I remind you of. 
BUCKAROO BANZAI She was the Queen of the Netherlands. 
PENNY PRIDDY It's kinda hard this way. 
Meaning fixing his tie...which she's trying to do... 
BUCKAROO BANZAI I'd turn around, but I'm afraid you'd strangle me. 
PENNY PRIDDY The Netherlands.  Whew, that's a long way from Wyoming. 
BUCKAROO BANZAI Wyoming? Not Cody, by any chance? 
PENNY PRIDDY No.  Laramie.  Except I was born in Cody. How did you know that?  Oh, right, sure, I forgot: you know everything. 
BUCKAROO BANZAI No, I don't. 
PENNY PRIDDY Hey, better there than here, huh? 
SOME APPLAUSE, the Secretary of Defense eyeing Penny critically as the lights dim...as RADAR SHIELD ONE slips into the room, approaches the dais, and the FIRST SLIDE is projected onto the screen... 
...the image a murky one...but the outline of a WARSHIP WITH U.S. SAILORS ABOARD nonetheless unmistakable... 
CLOSE ON:	148 
RADAR SHIELD ONE (a whisper) The President's calling you, Buckaroo. 
BUCKAROO BANZAI The president of what? 
RADAR SHIELD ONE The President of the United States. 
ANOTHER SLIDE, even more graphic, the number on the bow of the ship plainly visible...7541. 
EVERYONE CAPTIVATED.	150 
BUCKAROO BANZAI Is he still delirious? 
RADAR SHIELD ONE (shrugging) Can't tell. It's real fuzzy. I patched him through to a pay phone down the hall. 
PROF. HIKITA In 1942, a U.S. Navy frigate, number 7541, disappeared on a clear day in the North Atlantic. Long thought to have been torpedoed, these pictures of 7541 were taken yesterday in the Eighth Dimension. 
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE Now wait a minute here... 
PROF. HIKITA Next transparency, please. 
A loud murmur from the audience as the next slide in the projector proves to be a remarkable image... 
...of AN UPSIDE DOWN SEVENTEENTH CENTURY PIRATE VESSEL.	151 
...Buckaroo starting from the table only to be reminded by Penny:	152 
PENNY PRIDDY Buckaroo, don't forget your thruster. 
...handing him the OSCILLATION OVERTHRUSTER...Buckaroo declining it... 
BUCKAROO BANZAI You keep an eye on it. 
PENNY PRIDDY Any time. 
EXT.  OUTER SPACE - AFTERNOON	153 
Meanwhile, several thousand miles overhead, a HUGE SPIKEY SPACECRAFT APPROACHES EARTH... 
INT.  SPIKEY SPACECRAFT (FATHER SHIP) - AFTERNOON	154 
A mysterious cloud room where BLACK BRRODING CREATURES perch upside down and sideways at controls in a smoky, vaporous environment, the only illumination EERIE YELLOW LIGHT...THE WALLS BREATHING. 
BUCKAROO BANZAI'S VOICE Mr. President--? You there? 
MORE NOISES, THE SOUND OF TELEPHONE SWITCHING EQUIPMENT... 
INT.  CORRIDOR - AFTERNOON	155 
Back at a pay phone in the corridor, Buckaroo trying to figure out why the President doesn't answer. 
RADAR SHIELD ONE Seemed like a bad connection even back on the bus.  But they used the code. 
BUCKAROO BANZAI Mr. President--?  Some kind of interference...I can't... 
Nothing from the other end except ODD SOUNDING COMPUTER BEEPS and the STATIC-LADEN VOICES of several operators... 
RAWHIDE Maybe it's just a prankster. Some computer whiz kid. 
RENO Whoever it was they used the Blue Code, Alpha Clearance. 
BUCKAROO BANZAI (to Radar Shield One) Go back to the bus and reroute the call. 
RAWHIDE And try the President's private number at the hospital.  Make sure this is on the level. We're busy people here. 
...when suddenly eerie, inexplicable things begin to occur...ALL HAVING TO DO WITH ELECTRICITY...the telephone book scooting closer to Buckaroo's fingers as if drawn by a magnet, the pages then turning, faster and faster... 
...Buckaroo amazed...now the glass phone booth door abruptly slamming shut, the phone simultaneously emitting a BIZARRE BUZZ... 
...and then Buckaroo gets literally the shock of his life...A MIGHTY ELECTRICAL CURRENT PASSING THROUGH THE TELEPHONE... 
...AND HURLING HIM OUT INTO THE COORIDOR!	159 
BUCKAROO BANZAI Pencil!  Quick!  Pen!  Anything! 
The chase continues, leaving the city behind... 
EXT.  WOODED ROAD - LATER AFTERNOON	173 
...the van coming straight toward us, thundering past...as Buckaroo and his motorcycle next roar INTO CAMERA in hot pursuit, and over his shoulder an AWESOME SIGHT... 
...A DARK, UNNERVINGLY PREHISTORIC CREATURE FLYING DIRECTLY AT US, GROWING LARGER AND LARGER ON THE SCREEN, BUCKAROO UNAWARE OF ITS EXISTENCE... 
EXT.  FIELD - LATE AFTERNOON	174 
Twilight enveloping a New Jersey meadow as a pair of DUCK HUNTERS and their DOG takes advantage of the last half hour of fading daylight as... 
...that BLACK CREATURE wings overhead!	175 
The duck hunters confused, frightened, FIRING, as a reflex reaction to this sudden threat from above! 
CLOSE ON the AWFUL BLACK CREATURE HIT, swooping low with a horrible shudder! 
The hunters transfixed...	178 
DUCK HUNTERS My God!  What the hell... 
The FRIGHTFUL sound of the CREATURE'S FAILING LUNGS...a terrific noise as the duck hunters hurry to where their unnatural kill hangs obscured in a gigantic tree...their dog running ahead, intent on retrieving this unusual "BIRD"... 
EXT.  TREE - LATE AFTERNOON	179 
The heavy-footed hunters SLOSHING THROUGH WATER, the first hunter to arrive on the scene using a sharp stick to poke at a BULGING BLADDER on the bottom of the strange creature, the sac bursting and drenching the hunter with a hideous viscous fluid...SPARKS!  AND A STRANGE BLUE DUST... 
...as suddenly AN ENORMOUS SPHERE drops out of the tree and begins rolling toward the hunter who poked that sac... 
DUCK HUNTERS Jesus Christ--!  What is it? 
The other hunter following the ODD SPERE as it backs his buddy into a shallow swamp...the thing coming to a stop and... 
...A BLACK MAN with dreadlocks emerging from the top of the weird vessel, trying to balance himself when he slips and crashes to the ground, his neck breaking...a beam from his dropped 'flashlight' revealing him in death to be not a black man, but a BLACK ALIEN WITH A THREE-FINGERED HAND... 
...the hunters terrified as their dog starts snarling at the tree where now a second BLACK MAN has emerged, running for the road, jumping the fence like a gazelle... 
...the hunters not seeing this second individual, obsessed instead with a BUCKAROO BANZAI COMIC BOOK they've discovered in the dead alien's fingers. 
1ST HUNTER It's the latest issue! 
EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE - TWILIGHT	184 
Buckaroo still on his MOTORCYCLE in pursuit of the van, taking a daring shortcut down a treacherous hillside... 
INT.  VAN - TWILIGHT	185 
Alien John Bigbooté at the wheel, alien John Gomez riding shotgun, in high spirits, cradling a DRY CELL BATTERY, his strange tongue upon it, getting high...his teeth glowing. 
Bigbooté turning in his seat, overhearing alien John O'Connor operating a RADIO in the rear of the speeding van... 
JOHN O'CONNOR What? A black ship?  Where? (listening) A black thermopod's been shot down ten miles back. 
JOHN BIGBOOTÉ A black thermopod here?  On Earth?!  Why, John Gomez?  Why? 
John Bigbooté looking at John Gomez for any possible explanation. 
JOHN GOMEZ John Whorfin...maybe they know he's escaped! 
JOHN O'CONNER How?  How could they possibly know?  They're more than three trillion six hundred sixty million miles away. 
JOHN BIGBOOTÉ (jerking the wheel) They know everything!  I told Whorfin to sit tight.  This could be the end of us all!  We gotta get Banzai's Overthruster and get off this rock! 
EXT.  VAN - TWILIGHT	186 
The van making a 180( turn! 
INT.  VAN - TWILIGHT	187 
John Bigbooté yelling back to John O'Connor: 
JOHN BIGBOOTÉ Where was it, John O'Connor? How far back? 
JOHN O'CONNOR I have a radio fix... 
John Gomez opening the glove compartment, taking out a pistol: 
JOHN GOMEZ Death to the enemy! 
JOHN O'CONNOR Death to the enemy--!  Kill or die! 
BUCKAROO'S POV: The ungainly SPHERICAL SPACECRAFT and that amazing DEAD CREATURE on the ground, covered now with a sheet of semi-transparent plastic...observing John Bigbooté and John Gomez producing official I.D.s and appearing to BUCKAROO AS CRIMSON ALIENS...TO THE COPS AS... 
ORDINARY CITIZENS:	198 
JOHN BIGBOOTÉ John Bigbooté, Officer. Executive Vice President, Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems. 
JOHN GOMEZ (of the spacecraft) One of our birds. 
The highway patrolman returning Bigbooté's I.D., still a little skeptical about the whole thing, pointing to THE DEAD CREATURE UNDER PLASTIC. 
HIGHWAY PATROLMAN That fella over there-that one of yours, too, is it? 
John Bigbooté having a ready answer... 
JOHN BIGBOOTÉ The droid, you mean? 
Buckaroo moving quickly to the back of the van, starting to open the rear door with a locksmith's pick attached to his special SWISS ARMY LIGHTER. 
ELECTRICITY JUMPING FROM HIS FINGERS.	200 
Buckaroo dropping the two-way radio homing device on the bumper... 
INT.  VAN - CRASH SITE - NIGHT	202 
The sound of the Swiss Army lighter jolting red alien John O'Connor...O'Connor thinking the noise has come from the crate itself... 
JOHN O'CONNOR Button up in there, Professor, if you know what's good for you. 
John O'Connor stepping out for a smoke. 
EXT.  VAN - NIGHT	203 
Buckaroo watching the alien John O'Connor move off in the direction of the hunters, retrieving his dropped Swiss Army lighter, not noticing that the once blinking L.E.D. on the homing device has gone out! Buckaroo again picking the lock... 
EXT.  CRASH SITE - NIGHT	204 
...ordinary citizen John O'Connor meanwhile observing the hunters still hanging around, one of them engrossed in the Buckaroo comic, his pal trying to figure out how to operate the dead alien's unusual flashlight... 
JOHN O'CONNOR Nice night, huh? 
INT.  VAN - NIGHT	205 
...as Buckaroo stealthily enters, working the lock on the crate now with his all-purpose lighter. 
CLOSE ON HIS FINGERS EMITTING THE OCCASIONAL SPARK...	206 
EXT.  SWAMP - NIGHT	207 
John Bigbooté, John Gomez, and the cop looming above the dead creature... 
HIGHWAY PATROLMAN Looks like nothing I ever seen. I seen droids in space movies, but they're nothing like this- 
JOHN GOMEZ It's a three-man thermopod... 
John Bigbooté shooting John Gomez a hard stare... 
HIGHWAY PATROLMAN Thermopod?  What's a... 
JOHN BIGBOOTÉ Very T.S.  Top Secret, right John Gomez? 
HIGHWAY PATROLMAN Yeah, well, I was gonna call Buckaroo Banzai out here to have a look. Right up his alley, I think. 
John Bigbooté's mood suddenly changing...tensing... 
JOHN BIGBOOTÉ You called Buckaroo Banzai? 
HIGHWAY PATROLMAN Not yet.  I said I was gonna. 
The three of them looking up at another pair of headlights arriving, A SEDAN, the cop yelling at them: 
HIGHWAY PATROLMAN Go on!  Keep it moving! 
JOHN GOMEZ We got a truck on the way to mop things up for you.  Else this place could become a zoo, not to mention a haven for gawkers. 
The highway patrolman moving off to deal with the sedan... 
JOHN BIGBOOTÉ We'll just go ahead and start breaking it down. 
HIGHWAY PATROLMAN Don't touch it!  I got my own help on the way!  That's an order! 
John Bigbooté frowning, telling John Gomez: 
SCOOTER LINDLEY This is Scooter Lindley, Future Knight of the Blue Shield 411/2. Hang on! 
EXT.  GAS STATION - NIGHT	220 
Scooter racing outside toward his father, CASPER LINDLEY, the station owner, an everyday no-nonsense guy in grungy overalls, presently trying to sell a crushed velvet sofa from the top of a three-tier display rack to a PAIR OF DISCRIMINATING CUSTOMERS... 
SCOOTER LINDLEY Dad! Dad! Buckaroo's in trouble! 
CASPER LINDLEY Say what?! 
INT.  PASSENGER SECTION/BUS - NIGHT	221 
A weary, worried Rawhide comes back into the front of the bus and takes a seat near Penny and Reno... 
NEW JERSEY Trouble? 
RAWHIDE Nah-Damn sophisticated equipment always breaking down. 
Reno wondering if there's more to it than Rawhide's saying...Rawhide losing himself in a copy of American Horseman. 
Penny leaning forward, thinking, picking at a guitar left on the seat in front of her, watching the mysterious Hong Kong Cavaliers. 
Perfect Tommy arriving, whispering something in Rawhide's ear, Rawhide nodding... 
Penny looking over at Perfect Tommy across the aisle, Perfect Tommy confiscating the guitar...his guitar. 
PENNY PRIDDY What's his problem? 
RENO Perfect Tommy's just threatened by smart women.  Can you play that thing? 
PENNY PRIDDY Better than him. 
EXT.  CRASH SITE - NIGHT	223 
Buckaroo jockeying for an improved position, as the alien John Gomez prepares to strike the pod-TWO MEN getting out of the sedan now...ARACHTOIDS in baggy suits... 
...THE CROWBAR HITTING THE POD for the first time! 
The cop turning, shouting at John Gomez from his squad car: 
HIGHWAY PATROLMAN Whadda you think you're doing?  Hey! 
The cop in a jam, heading back toward the pod, as the two newly arrived redheads follow him despite his instructions: 
HIGHWAY PATROLMAN I said back off!  I mean it.  Now get in your car and get the hell outta here! 
...the two goons halting...but as soon as the cop turns, they follow him again... 
EXT.  FRONT GATES/BANZAI INSTITUTE - NIGHT	225 
A modest estate, several unique buildings on several acres of rolling Midlothian grassland, home of Buckaroo Banzai and the Hong Kong Cavaliers...that famous Double B logo festooning a large front gate...a sign: THE BANZAI INSTITUTE FOR BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING AND STRATEGIC INFORMATION. 
...A NUMBER OF BUCKAROO'S DEVOTED FANS perpetually outside with sleeping bags and cameras...a wave of excitement rippling through the crowd as BUCKAROO'S DOUBLE BUS approaches and THREE BLUE SHIELDS on guard begin opening the gate. 
INT.  FOYER/BUCKAROO'S HOUSE - NIGHT	227 
A combination Japanese ryokan-American ranch house, an elegant reflection of Buckaroo's dual lineage...a teenage girl heading for the door to answer an insistent buzzer...she MRS. JOHNSON... 
...Penny and the Hong Kong Cavaliers standing outside...Mrs. Johnson reacting as if she's seen a ghost... 
MRS. JOHNSON Peggy--!?  Oh, wow...no... 
RENO She's not Peggy, Mrs. Johnson-- 
MRS. JOHNSON Not Peggy--!  Of course not. How could she be, huh?  Whew. 
RAWHIDE Any word from Buckaroo? 
MRS. JOHNSON No...I thought he was with you guys... 
The Cavaliers quickly dispersing...Penny left alone under Mrs. Johnson's curious eyes... 
INT.  STUDIO-COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT	229 
...the Cavaliers stepping into a home studio, a tangle of wires and microphones, mixing consoles and data banks tended by a skeleton crew of BLUE SHIELD TECHNICIANS...one a brainy, wiry kid in his late teens. 
BRAINY KID Hi, fellas...gonna lay down some background vocals tonight? 
RAWHIDE Wish life was so simple, Billy.  Remember that outfit the Justice Department checked into last year-Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems? 
BRAINY KID (BILLY) The big space and weapons high tech consortium way behind on their delivery of the controversial new Truncheon Bomber? 
EXT.  FRONT GATES/BUCKAROO'S HOUSE - NIGHT	242 
Professor Hikita on motorcycle, being waved through the front gate by a BLUE SHIELD GUARD while a second Shield, PINKY CARRUTHERS (on HORSEBACK), telephones ahead... 
PINKY CARRUTHERS The prof just rolled in.  Says he's on his way to the lab and "Do not disturb." 
INT.  STUDIO COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT	243 
Reno on the phone, getting the word on Hikita while the other Cavaliers watch Billy call up a strange senseless MAZE OF LETTERS AND NUMBERS on his monitor... 
RAWHIDE Try a new cipher.  Try G. 
BILLY G cipher. There!  More like it! 
NEW JERSEY Nice work, kid. 
CLOSE UP SCREEN:  the letters having at least turned into something coherent...a batch of names and dates, vital statistics...headed "YOYODYNE." 
BILLY Looks like we've accessed their Read Only Memory...a personnel file. Could be highly revealing. 
RENO (rejoining the group) The professor just pulled in, jabbering something about space monsters, locked himself in his lab. 
PERFECT TOMMY "Space monsters"...my ass. 
INT.  HALLWAY/BUCKAROO'S HOUSE - NIGHT	246 
Mrs. Johnson leading Penny down a richly paneled corridor past pictures and momentoes of Buckaroo and the Cavaliers, past and present... 
MRS. JOHNSON I'm sure the boys like you.  They just don't wanna get attached...and then see what happened to Buckaroo's last sweetheart happen to you. 
PENNY PRIDDY What happened to her? 
Mrs. Johnson biting her tongue... 
MRS. JOHNSON You know any judo? 
PENNY PRIDDY Any what? 
MRS. JOHNSON Don't worry, I won't hurt you. 
Penny staring at this strange young girl, not knowing what to say... 
PENNY PRIDDY What's up those stairs? 
MRS. JOHNSON Bunkhouse.  Off limits.  You'll be bedding down in here. 
...Mrs. Johnson opening a guest room door...Penny eyeing those forbidden stairs... 
INT.  STUDIO COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT	247 
BILLY This is queer...look... 
Billy staring intently at the monitor...the others leaning in... 
CLOSE ON MONITOR:  a list of IDENTICAL DATES AND PLACES NEXT TO A RAFT OF NAMES. 
BILLY All these people applied for drivers' licenses in the same town in New Jersey on the exact same date. 
NEW JERSEY New Jersey? 
BILLY Forty-six Yoyodyne employees.  Grover's Mill, New Jersey, 11/1/38. 
RAWHIDE Grover's Mills, Grovers' Mills...1938.  Why's that so darn familiar? 
RENO Looks like none of these guys ever lived anywhere else.  No places of birth.  And all of them with the same first name: John. 
New Jersey studying the screen... 
NEW JERSEY November 1, thirty days have September, April, June, and November...when short February's done, all the rest have thirty-one. October 31st!  Halloween!  Don't you get it? (obviously not) Orson Welles! 
BILLY You mean the guy from the old wine commercials? 
NEW JERSEY Halloween. 1938..."War of the Worlds"...that fake radio news broadcast that got everybody scared, thinking that real live Martians were landing in Grover's Mill, New Jersey!  But then it all just turned out to be a hoax. 
BILLY Then that's it! 
RENO What's it? 
NEW JERSEY Right!  Hoax my eye! 
RENO You mean--?  No! 
BUCKAROO BANZAI What? How do you know that? 
RAWHIDE It's all on the record. Come on- 
Buckaroo heading up the stairs... 
UPSTAIRS HALLWAY...BUCKAROO MOVING QUICKLY DOWN THE CORRIDOR with his men, being debriefed on the run: 
BUCKAROO BANZAI Planet 10?  The same Planet 10 you postulated beyond Pluto, Perfect Tommy?  The invisible body? 
PERFECT TOMMY Yeah, but most of 'em blasted in through the Eighth Dimension in 1938 at Grover's Mills, New Jersey... 
RENO ...where there was some kinda giant crash landing, a huge explosion and they fooled Orson Welles into covering it up!  And then they founded Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems and hid there for... 
BUCKAROO BANZAI Orson Wells?  What about Doctor Lizardo? 
PERFECT TOMMY Lizardo caused it all.  Because he was already here on earth, screwing around with his own stupid Overthruster. 
RAWHIDE Faulty design.  It sucked. 
RENO ...but he wasn't the real Doctor Lizardo...just this arachtoid creep that stole the good doc's body the year before in the Eighth Dimension when Prof. Hikita's lab exploded... 
BUCKAROO BANZAI Stole his body?  When Doctor Lizardo's hair turned red and his mind snapped?  Of course!  What else? 
PERFECT TOMMY It wouldn't tell us the whole story until you got here.  It wasn't to talk to the head honcho. 
BUCKAROO BANZAI It?  Who does? 
INT.  INSTITUTE LABORATORY - NIGHT	261 
Professor Hikita and his assistant toil away, starting at... 
...an elaborate electron-tube apparatus that just now beings to produce TINY GLOWING GREEN PARTICLES... 
...the professor excited, confused...rechecking Buckaroo's EQUATION ON HIS FOREHEAD by looking into a mirror. 
INT.  BUCKAROO'S STUDY - NIGHT	264 
...while Billy places John Parker's UNUSUAL YELLOW RECORD on a turntable in Buckaroo's cluttered office...Casper and Scooter and the Cavaliers seeking protection behind a PLEXIGLAS 'BLACKBOARD', their faces seen through a maze of mathematical symbols and equations... 
...Buckaroo at his messy desk with a can of beer, FASCINATED TO SEE HE STILL POSSESSES ENOUGH STATIC ELECTRICITY IN HIS HAND TO DRAW A SHEET OF PAPER UP FROM THE BLOTTER LIKE A MAGNET! 
RENO Stand back, man... 
...as the needle now comes down on the yellow disc, and amid a flurry of SMOKE AND SPARKS, A GORGEOUS BLACK HUMAN FEMAL sizzles up from the grooves of the record and hovers in mid-air...A HOLOGRAM! 
HOLOGRAM Salutations, great Buckaroo Banzai.  I am John Emdall from Planet 10. A common grave danger confronts both our worlds. 
INT.  CORRIDOR - NIGHT	267 
Meanwhile out in the corridor, Mrs. Johnson advances with a load of cold beers and Birdseye burritos...passing by a figure frozen in the shadows...OUR POV: THE ALIEN JOHN O'CONNOR.  Mrs. Johnson gone, none the wiser. 
INT.  BUCKAROO'S STUDY - NIGHT	268 
Mrs. Johnson entering, dropping some of her load in shock at the sight of beautiful John Emdall floating free in the center of the room... 
MRS. JOHNSON Oh, wow... 
Reno picking her things up, as Mrs. Johnson backs away from the HOLOGRAM and sticks the burritos in a portable microwave oven in the corner of Buckaroo's desk... 
JOHN EMDALL After a bloody reign of terror, the hated leader of our military caste, the self-proclaimed "Lord" Whorfin, a bloodthirsty butcher as evil as your Hitler was overthrown by freedom-loving forces, tried, and condemned, along with several hundred of his followers, to spend eternity in the formless void of the Eighth Dimension. Death was deemed too good for their ilk. 
RENO Did you tell Penny Buckaroo wanted to see her? 
MRS. JOHNSON She's not in her room...I looked. 
BUCKAROO BANZAI Will everybody please shut up so I can hear this thing? 
JOHN EMDALL Were it not for the experiments of your father and Professor Hikita and the real Doctor Lizardo, then John Whorfin would still be locked safely away on another plane of existence. 
Rawhide and Pinky Carruthers holding a whispered conversation elsewhere in the room... 
PINKY CARRUTHERS "John Parker" I think he called himself, this Rasta man on a bike dressed up in aluminum foil.  With a weird album...how the hell was I supposed to know he came from outer space? 
Buckaroo moving dangerously close to the HOLOGRAM... 
John Emdall suddenly pointing right at the great man...	273 
JOHN EMDALL And now, you, Buckaroo Banzai, have unintentionally helped John Whorfin further with your Oscillation Overthruster! For our intelligence warns us that John Whorfin is about to make good his escape from Earth back through the Eighth Dimension...and on to Planet 10! If he should attempt this we will have no choice but to disrupt worldwide electronic communications and fire a particle beam weapon from your airspace to Smolensk, in the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republics. 
PERFECT TOMMY An action the Kremlin will most certainly misinterpret as an American first strike! 
PENNY PRIDDY How did she die?  I wanna know. 
BUCKAROO BANZAI You don't wanna know. 
PENNY PRIDDY Yes, I do.  Gimme a chance.  I'm stronger than you think. 
BUCKAROO BANZAI She was murdered by Hanoi Shan on our wedding night. 
PENNY PRIDDY Hanoi Shan--?  The guy in your comic books.  Boss of the World Crime League?  Supreme Commander of the Legion of Death?  The Pivot of Mystery himself?  You're putting me on.  He's a cartoon character. 
BUCKAROO BANZAI I wish he was.  He's real enough. 
Penny having to sit down and think about this as Buckaroo straps on his guns...changes his torn and shredded jacket...Penny looking at a BUCKAROO BANZAI COMIC BOOK on the night stand...then at the framed photograph of Peggy... 
PENNY PRIDDY God, she's so young and beautiful.  I don't remember her at all.  Which I guess is good, under the circumstances.  I bet you'll never forget her though. 
One look at Buckaroo says it all... 
BUCKAROO BANZAI Never. 
PENNY PRIDDY I gotta be honest with myself and not repress these feelings-I've got mixed emotions-I don't know if I can handle this.  Oh, boy... 
BUCKAROO BANZAI I gotta go.  We're on borrowed time. 
PENNY PRIDDY Go where?  Where're you going? 
BUCKAROO BANZAI (squatting close to her) Please, Penny.  You just gotta trust me now.  Okay?  And don't panic. Because it's gonna be all right. 
PENNY PRIDDY What?  If we just believe in Buckaroo Banzai? 
BUCKAROO BANZAI Yeah...and maybe more important, if you believe in yourself. 
PENNY PRIDDY Believe in Penny Priddy? 
BUCKAROO BANZAI Absolutely. 
Penny looks into his eyes... 
PENNY PRIDDY You've got your six guns strapped on.  You're ridding off on another adventure?  Oh, my God, it's all real...it really is real.  I should go with you.  Please... 
BUCKAROO BANZAI It's too dangerous. 
PENNY PRIDDY That's just what you would say.  This is so unreal.  I'm dreaming... 
Starry-eyed, she leans forward to kiss him, Buckaroo about to oblige when their fingers touch, Penny getting a MILD ELECTRICAL SHOCK... 
...the door suddenly opens and Perfect Tommy sticks his head in... 
PERFECT TOMMY (breathless) Buckaroo--! Sorry-- 
BUCKAROO BANZAI What is it, Tommy? 
PERFECT TOMMY Sam's dead!  Someone broke into the Jet Car! And things are going haywire over at the lab... 
Buckaroo running for the door, calling over his shoulder to Penny: 
BUCKAROO BANZAI Stay here, I'll be back. 
PENNY PRIDDY Sure.  I won't hold my breath. 
EXT.  BUCKAROO'S HOUSE - NIGHT	282 
Buckaroo, the Cavaliers, and the Lindleys race out of the house toward the research building... 
INT.  BUCKAROO'S BEDROOM - NIGHT	283 
Penny hurriedly changes clothes...puts on Peggy's clothes...when suddenly THE SIGHT OF JOHN O'CONNOR standing in the hallway door, leering at her... 
PENNY PRIDDY Whadda you want? 
John O'Connor, remembering her from the press conference... 
JOHN O'CONNOR Nothing right now, Penny Priddy. 
John O'Connor vanishing...Penny again at a loss... 
INT.  BANZAI INSTITUTE - NIGHT	284 
Buckaroo and the Cavaliers running inside, racing up a bright yellow staircase to the second floor... 
INT.  INSTITUTE LABORATORY - NIGHT	285 
The arachtoid John Bigbooté whirling, firing a STINGER that whizzes past Buckaroo's head, missing by inches...as Buckaroo FIRES twice...John Bigbooté screaming...kicking at a small fresh air vent, somehow squeezing his huge body out the tiny opening like a rat. 
INT.  DRAFTING ROOM - NIGHT	298 
Buckaroo helping Professor Hikita up out of the floor...Rawhide lying very still now, surrounded by Reno, Perfect Tommy and New Jersey... 
...one look between New Jersey and Buckaroo sufficient to tell us that Rawhide hasn't got a chance...Buckaroo kneeling beside his old pal, Rawhide forcing a smile... 
RAWHIDE You're a welcome sight... 
BUCKAROO BANZAI Just 'grazed' you, huh? 
New Jersey extracting a strange MANY-PRONGED STINGER from Rawhide's back.  Buckaroo looking at it...Rawhide maintaining a sense of humor... 
RAWHIDE Apache? 
BUCKAROO BANZAI Arachtoid. 
RAWHIDE So I was right.  That's nice to know... 
Across the room, Pinky Carruthers comes in with Casper and Scooter Lindley, and that black man from Planet 10, John Parker... 
PINKY CARRUTHERS We found the guy, Rawhide, sucker dug a hole and tried to... 
Pinky's words catching in his throat as he sees Rawhide's condition. 
Buckaroo turning, seeing not a 'guy' but A GIANT ARACHTOID standing there... 
Rawhide fading fast, Buckaroo lobbing the STINGER to "John Parker"... 
BUCKAROO BANZAI Any antidote for these things? 
John Parker holding the stinger in his palm... 
JOHN PARKER No, none. 
...as it suddenly comes alive!  He drops it to the floor, stomps it to death... 
PERFECT TOMMY That mean you're on our side? 
RAWHIDE (sinking) We gotta stop 'em, Buckaroo. 
Buckaroo turning from the BLACK ARACHTOID to his dying buddy... 
BUCKAROO BANZAI We will, old fried, we will. 
RAWHIDE Sure do pack a mean wallop...let's go... 
BUT RAWHIDE CLOSING HIS EYES FOR THE FINAL TIME, as Buckaroo feels for a pulse...the look in the great man's eyes saying it all...sadness mixed with anger... 
BUCKAROO BANZAI There's another one we owe 'em. 
...THE SOUND OF A HELICOPTER STARTING UP... 
CASPER LINDLEY They're stealing my chopper! 
The Cavaliers racing for the window... 
RENO And they got Penny!  Look! 
BUCKAROO BANZAI Don't shoot! 
PROF. HIKITA She has the Overthruster! 
JOHN PARKER Then your planet is doomed. 
BUCKAROO BANZAI No! (calmer) We'll get it back. 
Buckaroo shoving Perfect Tommy aside, at the window himself now. 
BUCKAROO'S POV...a fleeting glimpse of THE STOLEN LINDLEY CHOPPER... 
INT.  WALTER REED ARMY HOSPITAL - NIGHT	302 
CLOSE ON the familiar face of the Secretary of Defense seen from an unusual angle...PULLING BACK TO REVEAL PRESIDENT WIDMARK lying on his belly, surrounded by the electronics of his temporary set of government, staring down at a special mirror that reflects his Secretary of Defense, the Secretary pressing a point further an igniting a Camel with a lighter from the President's nightstand. 
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE It's not Buckaroo Banzai per se, Mr. President. It's his men...some of then foreigners...Asiatics, their names changed, their true backgrounds shrouded in secrecy! I mean, when you come right up against it, what do we really know about any of 'em? 
A NURSE appears with two little pills... 
NURSE These'll make you a tenny bit drowsy, Mr. President. 
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE John...?  John Bigboote?  Right, Bigbooté, sorry.  Anyway, hey, guy, how's everything over there at Yoyodyne?  How's my big bomber coming? Nothing out of the, you know, ordinary?  Spiders?  I know you're busy...lunch?  Sounds good...when's good for you?  Next Tuesday?  I'm writing it down in my book.  See you then...Uncle Sam's treat. 
The Secretary writes nothing down, hangs up, looking unsatisfied with the conversation just concluded. 
INT.  WORLD WATCH ONE/BUS - NIGHT	312 
Buckaroo glancing over at Professor Hikita and New Jersey, the latter squinting into the microscope... 
PRESIDENT WIDMARK ON TV Well.  I don't know what to say, Buckaroo...aliens from Planet 10, nuclear extortion, spiders in thunder clouds, a girl named "John"... 
NEW JERSEY There's your answer!  Electromagnetic bacterial crap! 
PROF. HIKITA Programmable! 
NEW JERSEY We inhale the bacteria.  It swims to our cerebral cortex and reprograms our consciousness.  Diabolical.  We only see what they want us to see. 
PROF. HIKITA Electric brainwashing. 
John Parker nearby, helping Reno synthesize more of Professor Hikita's ARACHTOIDAL ANTIDOTE and pour the liquid into GAS MASK FILTERS... 
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE McKINLEY STEPPING CLOSER INTO THE PICTURE... 
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE ON TV Just curious, Buckaroo, but where's the Jet Car at these days? 
BUCKAROO BANZAI I've got it, Mr. Secretary.  But unfortunately the Oscillation Overthruster is in Penny Priddy's possession and she's been kidnapped and taken to Yoyodyne, further exacerbating the situation. We're on our way there right now. 
INT.  WALTER REED ARMY HOSPITAL - NIGHT	313 
PRESIDENT WIDMARK Who the hell's Penny Priddy? 
The Secretary of Defense giving the President a sly 'I told you so' look... 
INT.  WORLD WATCH ONE/BUS - NIGHT	314 
Perfect Tommy coming over, interrupting... 
PERFECT TOMMY Buckaroo, John Parker has the arachtoid cloud on line 2! 
INT.  WALTER REED ARMY HOSPITAL - NIGHT	315 
BUCKAROO BANZAI ON TV Excuse me a moment, Mr. President.  We're talking to the cloud right now. 
And his image fades. 
PRESIDENT WIDMARK Good God... 
The President picks up the phone... 
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE Well, if it wasn't Buckaroo Banzai, I'd say commit the man. 
PRESIDENT WIDMARK Get me SAC HQ: Omaha, NORAD, and the Strategic Space Command. I want some hard data on that cloud. We got any killer satellites over Jersey- 
INT.  WORLD WATCH ONE/BUS - DAY	316 
Everyone studying a much MORE DETAILED COMPUTER ENHANCEMENT of the alien cloud... 
The Alien John Parker on the phone, whispering...	317 
RENO They're armed for bear, Buckaroo.  Check out those radiation levels. 
BUCKAROO BANZAI (to John Parker) John Parker, tell them we're doing our best.  Stall. 
JOHN PARKER (into phone) Buckaroo Banzai says patience is a virtue, Wing Commander, sir. 
Perfect Tommy interrupting again, holding yet another telephone... 
PERFECT TOMMY It's Whorfin, Buckaroo.  Line 3. 
BUCKAROO BANZAI Whorfin?  Does he know we're coming? 
INT.  SPEED OPERATOR'S PULPIT (YOYODYNE) - NIGHT	318 
Meanwhile in a grimy narrow control booth high above the factory floor, a terrified Penny Priddy sits BOUND and GAGGED, John O'Connor SPREADING THE CONTENTS FROM A HONEY-BEAR SQUEEZE BOTTLE over her naked arms while long trails of ORDINARY PICNIC ANTS make their way up her legs...John Bigbooté looking on... 
Penny's UNOPENED big clear plastic purse on Doctor Lizardo's desk, the OVERTHRUSTER right under his nose and he doesn't even know it as he speaks into the phone handed to him by an ASSISTANT.  BEGIN INTERCUTTING. 
DOCTOR LIZARDO Well, well...Dr. Banzai. Perhaps you don't remember me?  Ah, I'm flattered.  We know the same people.  In fact, one of them is here with me now...your associate, Doctor Penny Priddy. 
BUCKAROO BANZAI "Doctor"--? 
DOCTOR LIZARDO May I pass along my congratulations for your great achievement.  In the miserable annals of the Earth, you will be duly enshrined! However... (a pause) ...Miss Priddy claims to be unable to solve my problem. And provide the crucial missing circuit for my Overthruster.  Perhaps you can convince her to try. 
SENATOR CUNNINGHAM Stop acting like a goddamn schoolgirl, General, and pull yourself together. 
PRESIDENT WIDMARK I'm glad someone has the balls to face facts! (pause) Forget we're the good guys and we'd never attack first.  They think we're godless monsters just like them.  Put yourself in their samovars...sitting in the dark without radar, bells ringing all over the damn Kremlin, little men in fedora hats getting out of Zils, coming into the Great Hall of the People.  Now, do you think they're gonna listen to reason?  I'll give Buckaroo his Planet 10 space cloud, but do you think they will? 
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR (being handed a dispatch) Soviet radar is down, sir, and so is ours.  We're both totally defenseless.  More or less. 
GENERAL CATBURD Hail Mary. 
PRESIDENT WIDMARK So what's our counter option, General Catburd?  Earn your salary. 
GENERAL CATBURD I guess we have to prick this boil and take the heat, sir.  Hit 'em primero...blast 'em off the face of the Earth before they lose their heads and do it to us first. 
PRESIDENT WIDMARK Larry, where's my Football? 
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR Out in the hall, sir. 
INT.  WALTER REED HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT	326 
An apple-cheeked Marine Lieutenant sits watching a television soap opera, only the sinister BLACK BRIEFCASE chained to his wrist setting him apart from missions of other viewers...General Catburd sticking his head out of the President's room... 
GENERAL CATBURD What're you waiting for, boy?  Get in here with that thing. 
...as an out-of-breath Mrs. Johnson rounds the corner on rollerskates, out-foxing SECRET SERVICE AGENTS and the rest of the President's entourage, cutting through, clutching the YELLOW RECORD... 
MRS. JOHNSON For the President!  From Buckaroo Banzai! 
EXT.  RENDEZVOUS POINT - NIGHT	327 
A dimly lighted parking lot not far from Yoyodyne.  A KOLODNY BROS. PLUMBING VAN arrives, disgorging several tough BLUE SHIELDS as Buckaroo and Professor Hikita confer...the alien John Parker doing some highly unusual warm-up exercises on the tarmac...Reno telling the arriving Blue Shields: 
RENO We're waiting for the Jet Car.  Billy's bringing it. 
PERFECT TOMMY Asshole probably got lost. 
NEW JERSEY Or nailed for speeding. 
BUCKAROO BANZAI Can I have everyone's attention?  I'm not a rah-rah kinda guy, and I'm not much for speeches, but things could get rough out there tonight. It's a fight we didn't ask for, but it's a fight we're stuck with and we all saw what happened to Rawhide.  So if for any reason this is good-bye, I want you all to know that...well...that...you crazy lugs... 
Buckaroo finding it difficult to put into words what they all mean to him, the Cavaliers smiling, needling him... 
RENO What, Buckaroo?  You trying to tell us something? 
The JET CAR racing up, skidding to a stop, Billy jumping out, the big engine still running. 
BUCKAROO BANZAI Let's just fry those arachtoids. 
Buckaroo embracing Professor Hikita, turning back to his men, pulling on his helmet: 
BUCKAROO BANZAI Give me thirty minutes.  Then come in and mop up. 
Buckaroo tossing a quick Blue Shield salute, shutting himself into his speed machine. 
PROF. HIKITA'S POV as Buckaroo blasts off...an exhaust trail of white smoke as he rockets up the highway! 
INT.  YOYODYNE - NIGHT	329 
Penny Priddy, more bedraggled and filthy than ever, being dragged by John O'Connor deeper into the bowels of Yoyodyne, down a flooded subterranean corridor... 
INT.  WALTER REED ARMY HOSPITAL - NIGHT	330 
CLOSE ON THE PRESIDENT'S FACE...JOHN EMDALL'S VOICE OVER...talking thermonuclear war...wrapping her speech up...WHOOSH! 
PRESIDENT WIDMARK Well... that's certainly food for thought. 
Mrs. Johnson lifting the needle off the SMOKING RECORD...as the President's National Security Advisor places a call on that ominous STRANGE PHONE, a palpable tension rising, urgency bordering on panic... 
...General Catburd and the young Marine lieutenant rummaging through a confusion of envelops in the BLACK BRIEFCASE. 
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR No answer at the Kremlin, sir. Just dead silence. 
GENERAL CATBURD Here you go, Mr. President...the Sealed Authenticators.  The Plan D Documents for your eyes only...John-Hancock these, and we got ourselves a knockout little force posture... 
SENATOR CUNNINGHAM You know, on second thought, maybe we should think this through a bit more so that future generations of... 
THE LIGHTS IN THE ROOM START TO BLINK ON AND OFF...silencing the Senator...Catburd handing the President a writing implement...pulling out a special writing tray from the bed... 
PRESIDENT WIDMARK "Name of the enemy"?  What, Planet 10?  My hand's shaking.  How on earth can I even...have to stay awake, alert...that's my job.  That's what the people put me here for. 
INT.  FATHER SHIP - NIGHT	332 
Meanwhile inside the strange vaporous entity...BLACK CREATURES scuttle about their jobs in semi-darkness, monitoring the Earth below... 
INT/EXT.  PRESIDENT'S HELICOPTER - NIGHT	346 
A VIEW OVER THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE'S SHOULDER as the chopper descends, lands in a parking lot where Buckaroo's bus sits guarded by Cavaliers and Blue Shields...THE CAMERA FOLLOWING the Secretary right out into it all...A CARPET CLEANING VAN ARRIVING, THREE MORE TOUGH BLUE SHIELD IRREGULARS REPORTING FOR WORK..."THE RUG SUCKERS". 
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE Who the hell are those guys?  Where's Buckaroo? 
INT.  YOYODYNE SHOCK TOWER - NIGHT	347 
Buckaroo still held in his electric straitjacket...Lizardo nodding to the ARACHTOID in charge of a bank of glowing closed circuit TV sets...the same picture popping onto every set:  PENNY HANGING IN "THE PIT". 
BUCKAROO BANZAI You bloody--! 
DOCTOR LIZARDO She'll live...for a while, and she won't enjoy it. 
Lizardo indicates his favorite monitor...the INCOMPLETE OVERTHRUSTER equation flashing across its face. 
DOCTOR LIZARDO Only you can save her from the fate of your friend, Mr. Rawhide!  Solve this equation.  I must have the crucial missing circuit. 
CLOSE ON THE MONITOR...a riot of circuits and junctions...	348 
BACK TO:	349 
BUCKAROO BANZAI The missing circuit's in your head, Whorfin. 
DR. LIZARDO Whorfin?  How do you know that's my real name? 
BUCKAROO BANZAI John Emdall told me. 
Buckaroo smiles at Lizardo's surprise, Lizardo signaling John Bigbooté who turns on the voltage, ZAPPING Buckaroo! 
INT.  BUCKAROO'S BUS (PARKED) - NIGHT	350 
The Secretary of Defense pacing the aisle of the bus, looking at his watch while the Cavaliers and newly arrived Blue Shields conceal their eagerness for battle...checking watches, cleaning weapons. 
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE Anybody got a report-anybody got anything?  Or are we still blacked out? 
Perfect Tommy looking back into World Watch One... 
PERFECT TOMMY Light precipitation.  Partly cloudy tomorrow. 
SECREATARY OF DEFENSE This bus should be in the hands of Defense. 
...Scooter Lindley, wearing a gas mask, approaches the alien John Parker with a BLUE SHIELD BALLPOINT PEN and a piece of paper... 
SCOOTER LINDLEY Could I have your autograph, Mr. Parker? 
John Parker at first not understanding the nature of the request...looking at the ball-point pen, Scooter flipping the point for him... 
SCOOTER LINDLEY Say, "To my best friend Scooter..." 
JOHN PARKER You got it. 
...the Secretary of Defense, NERVOUSLY CRACKING HIS KNUCKLES...moving up the aisle, suddenly screaming: 
SCRETARY OF DEFENSE What the hell are we doing?!  I don't believe this...what're we waiting for?  Christmas? 
PROF. HIKITA (checking his watch) Ten minutes more.  Buckaroo's orders. 
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE Damn Buckaroo!  I'm the eyes and ears of the President of these United States of America!  In loco presidentis!  Which means I'm in charge here! 
PERFECT TOMMY Not on this bus, you're not. 
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE Who the hell do you think you are? 
PERFECT TOMMY Perfect Tommy. 
That answer alone enough to drive the Secretary up the wall... 
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE Well let me tell you something, Mr. Perfect Tommy: I don't need this shit.  I could be on Easy Street with a cushy job in the private sector.  But instead,  I got me a nine-hundred-million-dollar way-the- hell-behind-schedule top-secret bomber being built down there by Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems and I don't intend to set twiddling thumbs in a bus while Buckaroo Banzai goes crashing around my airplane looking for his damn girlfriend, driving a car that itself is probably worth more to this country than all the tea in China!  I'm talking National Security risk and we are going in there like gentlemen and straighten this thing out before somebody gets hurt!  You got that? 
...the Secretary suddenly grabbing a weapon from a surprised Blue Shield and turning it toward the driver... 
REVERSE ANGLE...THE SECRETARY CRACKING A SHOT OFF AT THE WINDSHIELD! 
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE Hit it, soldier boy!  Move this buggy!  That's a goddamn executive order!

INT.  LAUNCH HANGER - NIGHT	367 
The Secretary of Defense meanwhile reaching the big hangar, confused, alarmed, chaos everywhere, shouting over the din: 
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE Bigboote! 
...spotting John Bigbooté across the hangar floor, going after him, staring bug-eyed at the MONSTROUS-LOOKING SPACECRAFT suspended above the hangar floor... 
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE What the hell...that ain't no Truncheon bomber, my friend.  I never approved that! 
INT.  CORRIDOR - NIGHT	368 
The Secretary following the speedy John Bigbooté around a bend, unable to keep up... 
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE Bigboote! 
Bigbooté giving no indication of seeing him, rounding a corner ducking into his office... 
...the Secretary rounding the corner too but seeing no sign of Bigbooté...instead just an office door, a nameplate reading JOHN BIGBOOTÉ, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT...the Secretary of Defense opening the door... 
INT.  BIGBOOTÉ'S OFFICE - NIGHT	369 
...moving past a vacant receptionist's desk to John Bigbooté's cavernous, strangely furnished chamber...EMPTY. 
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE Bigboote?!  You can run, but you can't hide.  I want some facts! 
...but no sign of John Bigbooté. 
INT.  CORRIDOR - NIGHT	370 
Buckaroo and New Jersey still tracking Penny, moving through another flooded, slimy corridor we remember... 
INT.  BIGBOOTÉ'S OFFICE - NIGHT	371 
...the Secretary spying a phone on the receptionist's desk amid scattered Oreo cookies, picking the phone up, clicking it a couple of times to get a dial tone...totally ignoring AN AMAZING FRAMED PICTURE OF A RED ARACHTOID MOTHER AND CHILD ON THE DESK RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM... 
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE Operator...operator...how the hell does a person get an outside line around here? 
...his gaze now focusing squarely on that cheap framed photograph of the RED ARACHTOIDS...Secretary McKinley losing his bearings... 
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE Oh, Lord.  Never mind...forget it... 
...his mind reeling, refusing to accept the obvious, the oddly designed furniture and chairs in the room, somehow insect-like...a sudden sound...a WOMAN'S SCREAM that seems to come from...underneath the floor? 
...the Secretary cocking his weapon and stepping around the desk as an amazing thing occurs...A TRAPDOOR IN THE OFFICE FLOOR opening, the Secretary going to investigate, able to observe... 
HIS POV of...John O'Connor coming up a ladder and, in the room below, a barely conscious Penny still in her private hell, trussed and taped, ANTS CRAWLING ON HER ARMS...the lurid specter of John Bigbooté staring at her... 
INT.  THE PIT - NIGHT	373 
PENNY'S CLEAR PLASTIC PURSE UNOPENED ON THE DESK BESIDE HER, as the Secretary of Defense suddenly knocks John O'Connor down the ladder and jumps into the room, injuring his ankle... 
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE What the hell's is going on here, Bigboote? Where's my bomber? 
JOHN BIGBOOTÉ That's 'Bigbooté'. 
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE I don't give a flying handshake what it is! Where's my bomber? 
JOHN BIGBOOTÉ Let's just climb upstairs to my office and discuss this like two reasonable... 
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE Your private life's your own concern, pal.  Where the hell is my bomber?  Look at this place...where's your pride?  It's like a pigsty down here! 
THE TELESCOPING ARM of John Bigbooté suddenly shooting out and lifting the Secretary off the floor, banging him into the wall... 
JOHN BIGBOOTÉ It's not my goddamn planet!  Understand, monkey boy!? 
...BIZARRE LAMPS SWAYING as GUNFIRE upstairs prompts Bigbooté to release the Secretary, to urge O'Connor to head for a door off the hallway... 
JOHN O'CONNOR But John Whorfin said kill her. 
BLACK ARACHTOID COMMANDER So what?  Big deal.  Stand by to incinerate Smolensk.

AUTUMN IN NEW YORK 
Screenplay by 
Allison Burnett 
Shooting Draft 
FADE IN: 
EXT. CENTRAL PARK -- SEPTEMBER AFTERNOON 
A COUPLE moves down a walkway, deep in subdued conversation. All around them trees explode with autumn color. Birds sing. Their path is dappled with leafy shadow. 
To their left, on the sunny meadow, TEENAGERS throw saucers and footballs, smoke cigarettes and joints, drink beer and soda, savoring the waning hours of summer. 
CLOSER ON THE COUPLE 
He is WILLS KEANE, late 40's to early 50's, strikingly handsome, impeccably dressed, and supremely poised. At first glance he has the proud glow of a hedonist who in the war against time has been the undisputed victor. 
Only a closer look hints at the toll of battle. His shoulders strain under the weight of so much repetition. His eyes are touched by regret. The lines in his face reveal an emerging disenchantment not so much with the world as with himself. 
Walking at his side is a WOMAN, 30, attractive and bright. Her name is unimportant because so many have come before her and, if the past prevails, so many will come after. 
She listens intently, as Wills finishes speaking -- 
WILLS -- and I could have waited to tell you, but I wanted to leave no room for misunderstanding. 
WOMAN Well, you certainly didn't. 
EXT. ANOTHER CENTRAL PARK WALKWAY -- LATER 
Still talking quietly, they pass into a more secluded area of the park-- 
WOMAN No, I see how you could feel this way. Of course I do. It's human. But what I don't get is why you'd want to announce it so quickly. I mean, we just met. Feelings change. You don't even know me. 
WILLS Yes, I do. 
She is amused by his confidence -- 
WOMAN Oh, really? 
WILLS The minute I laid eyes on you. It's the saddest thing about getting older. You know people so quickly. I even knew you'd end up hating me. 
WOMAN Well, you're wrong. I don't. 
WILLS (with a weary smile) Give it time. 
She laughs. Then he stops. He hears something. She stops. She hears it, too. It's a GIRL'S VOICE. He casually turns and looks, squinting into the sun. 
He takes a few steps and there, between trees, he sees TWO DOZEN PEOPLE sitting on the grass and on folding chairs -- most are middle-aged or older with a distinctly intellectual- bohemian look to them. 
Standing and addressing them is CHARLOTTE FIELDING, 19, fair, willowy, pale, lovely in an unconventional way. She wears an eccentric hat and a vintage dress. Her bearing is upright, her gaze warm and intelligent, her voice rich with emotion -- 
CHARLOTTE -- and for weeks I sat by her bed and cried. I told her I loved her and I begged her not to leave me. All I could think about was what I'd lose if she died. And then one night... she was in really bad pain... I stopped thinking about myself for a second and I thought about her. (fighting tears) I stopped crying. I said goodbye. And in less than an hour Ella was gone. 
The woman whispers in Wills' ear -- 
WOMAN It's so sad. 
But Wills ignores her. He watches Charlotte with keen interest, touched by the depth and sincerity of her emotion. 
CHARLOTTE I really think it's possible to hold a person back... cry them back... from dying. That's what I did to Ella and I'll never do it to anyone else again. (softly) I hope no one ever does it to me. 
She looks out at the group, many of whom are crying. A tear runs down her cheek. She smiles and wipes it away. 
The woman, seeing Wills' interest in the girl, whispers -- 
WOMAN So what do you know about her? 
He knows a great deal. Or at least he thinks he does. But his answer is nonchalant -- 
WILLS That she's just a kid. 
He takes the woman gently by the elbow and guides her away. He steals one last look back. 
Charlotte, returning to where she was sitting, notices Wills. Their eyes meet and a charge passes between them. 
Meanwhile an OLD MAN has risen from his chair -- 
OLD MAN I met Ella at City College in 1938... 
Wills slowly turns and walks away. 
MUSIC AND TITLES IN: 
EXT. MANHATTAN SUBWAY STOP -- AUTUMN DUSK 
He goes back to tying his tie, then adds softly -- 
WILLS I could have waited to tell you, but I wanted to leave no room for misunderstanding. 
She stares at him, speechless. 
INT. RESTAURANT -- THAT NIGHT 
Its decor is exquisitely tasteful, its ambiance warm and convivial. The night is in full swing. Most of the tables are taken and the bar is packed. 
EXT. UPPER EAST SIDE -- SAME 
From amid the RUSH OF TRAFFIC, a TAXI breaks free and glides to the curb in front of the RESTAURANT. 
Its facade is windowless. Only a small brass plaque on the grey marble reveals that this is ELYSIUM. 
Wills and ERIKO, 30's, Japanese, aloof and stunning, emerge from the taxi, elegantly dressed, and move to the front door. 
INT. ELYSIUM -- CONTINUOUS 
TWO TIPSY DEBUTANTES pass Wills and Eriko as they enter. One recognizes Wills and smiles flirtatiously. 
Wills stops and helps Eriko off with her jacket. JESUS, 30, the dashing Cuban-American maitre d', superbly discreet, approaches -- 
JESUS Good evening, Mr. Keane. Will you be dining with us tonight? 
WILLS We certainly will. Table seven, Jesus, if it's available. 
JESUS Yes, sir. 
Wills hands Eriko's jacket to MELISSA, 20, the hat check girl -- 
WILLS How are you, Melissa? 
MELISSA (blushing) Fine, Mr. Keane. 
CELIA, mid-20's, the chipper, blonde Midwestern hostess, arrives, wearing a stunned, glassy smile. 
WILLS Good evening, Celia. And how -- 
CELIA (with forced cheeriness) Just dandy, sir, thanks! 
JESUS Table seven. 
CELIA This way, please. 
Celia, barely making eye contact with Eriko, walks quickly away. Wills is amused and a little confused by Celia's behavior. He lays a hand on Eriko's back -- 
WILLS I'll be right with you. 
Eriko nods and follows Celia. 
Wills moves to the reservation stand where his best friend and the restaurant's manager, JOHN VOLPE, 40, a brilliant, dapper, tough as nails Brooklynite stands, listening to someone on the telephone. 
Wills lays a hand on his shoulder and mutters into his ear -- 
WILLS How's it going? 
JOHN (covering the phone) Chaos. 
WILLS The house specialty. 
JOHN Easy for you to say, ya prick. Waltzin' in here like you own the joint. 
Wills laughs and takes a look into the bar. John gestures with his head in Eriko's direction -- 
JOHN So who's the new potential ex-wife? I thought you were still wastin' time with Tanya-von-What's-her-name. 
WILLS We wisely agreed to cut our losses. 
Wills exits into the bar. John smiles and shakes his head. 
FOLLOW WILLS, as he glides along the bar. CUSTOMERS and STAFF greet him warmly. 
As he enters the main dining room, DINERS spot him -- sprinkled among them are CELEBRITIES from every walk of city life. Wills greets them, stopping to shake their hands and kiss their cheeks. 
Suddenly, Celia, the hostess, red-faced, blocks his path -- 
CELIA Look, I have no right to say this, okay? And you can fire me if you want, but in the six weeks we've been open you've brought in six different women -- tonight makes seven -- and it's really starting to get to me. 
WILLS In what way? 
CELIA I have to greet them! It's like working at a dog shelter! I'm afraid to learn their names or even smile at them because I know any minute they could be put down! 
WILLS I assure you it's an absolutely painless procedure. 
Shocked, she can't help but sputter a laugh -- 
CHARLOTTE He's here. And he's staring at me again. 
SHANNON No way! 
Both Shannon and Simon turn to look, but like lightning Charlotte grabs them both -- 
CHARLOTTE Don't! (to Simon) Wait a few seconds, then go to the bathroom. 
SIMON How will I know him? 
CHARLOTTE He's beautiful. And much older. 
SIMON Really? (getting up) If he's rich you might have a fight on your hands. 
Charlotte watches furtively as Simon rises from his chair and walks over. As he passes Wills, he flashes him a seductive smile. Wills is confused by it. 
CHARLOTTE Okay, look. 
Shannon swivels her head and throws an aloof, vacant stare in Wills' direction. Then she looks back at Charlotte, mouth agape -- 
SHANNON He's as old as my dad! 
Charlotte laughs. 
BACK ON WILLS. He does his best to be attentive as Dolores exhales a plume of smoke into his face -- 
DOLLY Sure, L.A.'s okay if you're a cactus or a lizard, but if you're a New Englander, your soul dries up and blows away like a god damn leaf. 
WILLS It only took me twenty years to come to my senses. 
DOLLY So what're you doin' now? You owned some restaurants out there, didn't you? 
ON CHARLOTTE. She sits listening to Shannon -- 
SHANNON And so, after all that, we pay our cover, we get in, and it's totally heinous! Nothing but losers and -- 
Charlotte looks over and pales, her eyes widening -- 
CHARLOTTE Oh, shit. 
SHANNON What? 
Dolores walks up, hauling Wills by the arm -- 
DOLLY Kids! I want you to meet an old chum of mine, the owner of this fine establishment -- Wills Keane! 
The table greets him. Wills, slightly self-conscious, looks at everyone but Charlotte. 
DOLLY And that over there's the birthday girl -- my granddaughter, Charlotte. 
The news hits Wills hard. But he does his best to hide it. He musters a casual smile -- 
WILLS Not Katie and Jay's daughter? 
DOLLY You bet. She got her height from her dad. But her talent's all Katie's. 
Dolores indicates the hat that Charlotte's wearing -- 
DOLLY Made it herself from scratch. That one, too. (to Shannon) Honey, show 'im. 
Shannon makes an elaborate comic show of modeling the hat she's wearing. The table laughs. 
Wills levels his gaze at Charlotte -- 
WILLS Impressive. 
Try as she might to accept the compliment with grace, Charlotte can't help but grin. 
CHARLOTTE Thanks. 
The WINE STEWARD stands at a station on which sit TWO BOTTLES OF CHAMPAGNE on ice. He reaches for one. Wills stops him -- 
WILLS I think we can do better than that. 
The steward, understanding, nods and departs, taking the champagne with him. 
WILLS Happy birthday, Charlotte. 
CHARLOTTE Thanks. 
SHANNON (under her breath) Twenty years old and never been... 
CHARLOTTE (laughing) Shut up! 
Amused, he flashes Charlotte his most dazzling smile. 
WILLS I'll let you get back to your celebration. (kissing Dolly's cheek) A pleasure to see you again. 
MICHAEL Watch your step, Miss. 
CHARLOTTE Thank you. 
She emerges, moves to Wills' door, and waits for the elevator to close. When it does, she hurries back to a table over which hangs a GILDED MIRROR. 
She takes a LOVELY OLD HAT BOX out of the garbage bag and ditches the bag under the table. Then she quickly checks herself in the glass. 
She doesn't like what she sees. She pokes at her sopping hair and squeezes it, but it's hopeless. Remembering the time, she hurries back to the door, takes a deep breath, and rings the bell. 
She waits. And waits. Then she hears footsteps approaching. She realizes she's left the hat box on the table. 
She rushes over and grabs it, just in time to get back to the door when it OPENS. 
Olivia, the housekeeper, steps out, wearing her coat and carrying her purse. Her voice is low and gentle -- 
OLIVIA He's waitin' for you, Miss Fieldin'. 
They exchange cordial smiles. Charlotte enters. 
INT. WILLS' APARTMENT -- CONTINUOUS 
Charlotte steps into a dim hallway lined with oil paintings, carpeted with a Persian runner, and lighted by three antique sconces. She walks slowly, terribly self-conscious. 
INT. WILLS' LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS 
The room is vast, furnished with antiques, decorated with the same masculine good taste. Charlotte enters timidly, then hears -- 
WILLS What happened? 
She looks and sees Wills standing, back turned, before a broad set of high windows. City lights glimmer in the distance; beneath them lies the vast gloom of Central Park. 
CHARLOTTE I couldn't get a cab, so I took the subway... only it was an express and it didn't stop at -- 
WILLS You realize, don't you, that you're a full eighteen minutes late? 
CHARLOTTE I know... I'm so sorry... I -- 
Wills turns around. A magnificent figure -- expertly tailored tux, every hair in place, freshly manicured. And then he offers her an amused, reassuring smile -- 
WILLS Charlotte, relax. What's the point of being a beautiful young woman if it isn't to keep your admirers waiting? In fact, you disappoint me: I was looking forward to at least another half hour of suspense. 
Flattered, her face brightens -- 
CHARLOTTE I could leave and come back. 
WILLS Nope, too late. Anyway, I want to see the hat. 
He walks over to her. Smiling, she sets down the box, unties the ribbon, and gingerly removes the hat. It's sublimely simple and elegant. She looks at him with hope. His face betrays nothing -- 
WILLS Try it on. 
CHARLOTTE I can't. I'm soaked. 
WILLS It's all right. 
Charlotte, a little confused, carefully sets the hat on her head. She steps to a wall mirror, pulls the veil down, and sets it at the correct angle. 
Wills appears behind her and shares the reflection. She feels his presence, hears his breathing. They speak in hushed tones -- 
WILLS It's perfect. It's like a tiny sculpture. 
CHARLOTTE I wanted it to be a tiny poem. 
She smiles. Their eyes meet in the glass. 
WILLS If only I had some use for it. (off her look) My date canceled a few hours ago. 
CHARLOTTE Why? 
WILLS I don't know. She was vague. Would you... like to come in her place? 
Charlotte can't believe it. She smiles at his reflection. 
CHARLOTTE Like this? 
WILLS The outfit I bought her is hanging in the guest room closet. 
CHARLOTTE (anxiously) It's okay? Are you sure? 
WILLS (amused) Of course. 
He gestures toward the half-open door on other side of the room. Charlotte turns and, biting her lip, looks at the door, then back at Wills, then back at the door. 
INT. GRAND BALLROOM, PLAZA HOTEL -- NIGHT 
A spectacular affair is in full swing, a benefit for the METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART attended by FIVE HUNDRED GUESTS from HIGH SOCIETY dressed only in black and white. 
CHARLOTTE You know him? 
LISA Just by reputation. 
CHARLOTTE A major womanizer, right? 
LISA That's what they say. (beat) I'm Lisa. 
CHARLOTTE Charlotte Fielding. 
They shake hands. Lisa looks away and sees Wills making his way toward them with two glasses of punch. 
Coolly covering, Lisa beats a hasty retreat -- 
LISA Anyway, I should keep mingling. But it was nice to meet you. 
CHARLOTTE Same here. 
Lisa smiles politely and walks away. 
Wills walks up, watching Lisa melt into the crowd. His brow is furrowed. He's wondering if his eyes have deceived him. He hands Charlotte a punch -- 
WILLS Who was that? 
CHARLOTTE Lisa something. 
The name hits home. Wills is flustered, but then he covers as best he can and lifts his glass -- 
WILLS (lifting his glass) Here's to -- 
CHARLOTTE Us. 
Wills smiles slowly and they toast. 
INT. WILLS' LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT 
The room is empty. There's laughter in the distance. The front door opens and shuts. We hear Wills and Charlotte, both a little tipsy, advancing down the hall toward us -- 
CHARLOTTE God, you talk like you're a hundred and sixteen! 
WILLS That's usually how I feel. But not tonight. Tonight I feel sixteen... just sixteen... and three-quarters. 
Wills crosses to the bar and from a small refrigerator pulls out a BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE already sitting in an ice bucket. 
WILLS Champagne? 
CHARLOTTE He asked nonchalantly. 
Wills laughs, then opens the bottle as he picks up his previous train of thought -- 
WILLS You see, Charlotte, the way you know you're getting older is that you start to notice patterns. People start falling into types. Pretty soon you know a person before you've even been introduced. And if it's a woman, before the romance even starts, a whisper in your head tells you exactly what it is and how long it's going to last. And the saddest, the most tedious, part of all is that that little voice is almost always right. (popping the cork) Now, what I like about you -- and I think that's actually what inspired this little lecture -- is that I find you completely unprecedented... and, therefore, wholly unpredictable. 
CHARLOTTE God, it must be a relief. 
WILLS (confused) What? 
CHARLOTTE To finally deliver that speech to a woman and actually have it apply to her. 
WILLS Now wait a minute. 
CHARLOTTE No, because coincidentally I am all those things you just said. And more. 
Wills chuckles, shaking his head, charmed but a little unsettled. 
CHARLOTTE I'm a "unique". At least that's what my yoga teacher says. He says there are very few uniques in the world and I'm one of them. 
WILLS Well, he's a wise man. 
He hands her a glass of champagne. 
CHARLOTTE You, on the other hand, are what he'd call a "typical." 
WILLS Oh, really? 
CHARLOTTE Uh-huh. And I can prove it. Want me to? Come here. 
Wills moves a few steps closer. 
CHARLOTTE Closer. 
Wills walks even closer, until they are just a few feet apart. 
CHARLOTTE No, come on, really close. 
Wills can't believe his good luck. He nears her until their faces are almost touching. 
CHARLOTTE Perfect. Now watch very carefully. 
SIBLEY At present? Nothing. 
Wills shifts uneasily in his chair. 
SIBLEY Eventually she'll be treated for pain. In the end, surgery could become an option, but her chances of survival would be slim. Right now Charlotte's against it. She's signed a directive forbidding any sort of heroic intervention. 
A silence settles between them. Sibley opens a folder on his desk. 
SIBLEY There's more here if you're interested, but it won't mean much to you. 
Wills shakes his head and rises from his chair. He turns to the door, then turns back to the doctor -- 
WILLS How long? 
SIBLEY Optimistically? A year. 
EXT. ST. VINCENT'S HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM -- LATER 
Wearing her tattered jeans from the night before, Charlotte sits on the couch doing the New York Times crossword. Wills emerges, walking slowly, pensively, as though in a trance. 
Charlotte looks up and masks her anxiety with a grin -- 
CHARLOTTE A real charmer, isn't he? 
Wills doesn't react. He keeps walking toward her. Unsettled, she holds up the puzzle. 
CHARLOTTE How are you on Cambodian money units? 
Wills keeps advancing. 
CHARLOTTE Are you okay, old man? You look kinda woozy. (jokingly calling out) Is there a doctor in the house? 
Ignoring her, Wills sits down, takes her in his arms, and embraces her. At first she resists, but slowly she surrenders and hugs him back. 
INT. TAXI -- AFTERNOON 
As the cab bounces down a cobblestone Village street, Wills and Charlotte stare straight ahead, each following the tortuous path of his own thoughts. 
Slowly, Charlotte steals a sidelong look at him. His face is tense, ashen, and unreadable -- 
CHARLOTTE Hey. 
Wills slowly turns his head. She smiles sweetly -- 
CHARLOTTE Look on the bright side: if I weren't sick, there's no way we could hang out together. (off his look) I'm serious. You'd be scared of hurting me and I'd be scared you were just using me for my perfect young body. 
He can't help but smile. Encouraged, she moves closer -- 
CHARLOTTE And then our friends would say we were just into each other for weird psychological reasons. You know, because I'm looking for a daddy substitute and you're looking for someone you can feel superior to so you won't have to confront how scared you are of real intimacy -- and, of course, they'd be right and eventually we'd break up. (beat) But since I'm so sick it doesn't really matter what deep-seated weirdness has brought us together because there's no way we can possibly screw each other over... or up... because that takes time. And I don't have much left. 
The cab comes to a stop in front of her brownstone. She smiles archly, savoring the irony -- 
CHARLOTTE So considering everything, don't you think we should just sort of chill out, forget I'm sick, and enjoy what we have... right now... no strings... just this... until it ends? 'Cause that's really all I have to offer. 
Wills grimly appreciates the irony. 
CHARLOTTE Think about it, okay? But not too hard. 
She kisses his cheek and jumps out of the cab. She skips up the steps of the brownstone, then immediately turns around and runs back down to the open window. 
She leans in and mutters sexily -- 
CHARLOTTE Last night was so incredibly hot. (beat) By the way -- it was my first time. And I picked you for the job. I hope you're flattered. 
Wills is shocked. She turns and runs back upstairs. She sticks in the key, then turns and waves at Wills before banging open the door with her hip. 
DRIVER Okay, pal, where to? 
Wills hasn't moved a muscle. 
FROM THE NEXT SCENE, we hear the pop of FLASHBULBS and the whirr of SHUTTERS -- 
INT. DOWNTOWN LOFT -- NIGHT 
YOUNG FASHION MODELS OF EVERY RACE strut down a runway, modeling a new line of WOMEN'S URBAN CASUAL WEAR. 
FIND CHARLOTTE, ignoring the show, pushing through the crowd, hurrying toward the side of the stage. She speaks to a GUARD at the entrance and he lets her pass. 
INT. BACKSTAGE -- MOMENTS LATER 
Charlotte searches amid the chaos of models dressing and undressing. Finally, she spots them. 
FIND SIMON AND SHANNON styling a BLACK FEMALE MODEL in a tank top and fatigues. 
He applies a finishing touch, adjusting the tilt of the model's baseball cap. Shannon, lacing the girl's boots, works as Simon's assistant. 
EXT. SOHO STREET -- NIGHT 
They move through a doorway -- 
INT. BROWNSTONE LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS 
Wills is surprised by the room's run-down state. 
DOLLY Excuse the mess. My maid died fourteen years ago and it's been simply impossible to replace her. She did windows and spoke English. 
She chuckles to herself. Wills hands her the flowers. 
WILLS For you. 
DOLLY Well, aren't they loverly. 
She casually drops them into an EMPTY BLENDER at the bar. 
DOLLY Care for a cocktail? 
WILLS No, thanks. 
INT. CHARLOTTE'S BEDROOM -- SAME 
Simon lounges on the bed. Charlotte stands before a full- length mirror, trying on a dress. 
SIMON It really is uncanny. I tell you, in that dress you're the spitting image of Michel Simon. 
CHARLOTTE (flattered) Who's she? 
SIMON A French character actor, long dead, who was not only hideous and fat, but quite male. 
CHARLOTTE So that would be a "no." 
Simon nods. Charlotte takes off the dress. 
INT. BROWNSTONE LIVING ROOM -- SAME 
Wills looks around the room. Dolores splashes her drink with vodka -- 
DOLLY What can I say? Time's a thief. One day you're rich as an Arab, the next you're lucky if you can afford a god damn can of pistachio nuts. 
Wills wanders over to the mantel where FAMILY PHOTOS sit in tarnished antique silver frames. He picks up a photograph of a YOUNG GIRL in TENNIS WHITES -- it's Charlotte's mother, Katie. 
Wills' face is suffused with tenderness as he studies it. Dolores walks over and looks -- 
DOLLY How about that, huh? That was the summer you two -- 
WILLS I know. 
DOLLY Who'd have guessed what time had in store for her, huh? Look at that smile. 
Eyes moistening, Dolores crosses to her armchair. Her tone is slightly bitter -- 
DOLLY Then again, time loves some people. Like you, for instance. Oh, time's just wild about you. 
She plops down unsteadily and reaches for her cigarettes -- 
DOLLY Just as handsome and charming as ever. And still up to the same old tricks. 
Wills sets the photo back on the mantel -- 
WILLS What do you mean? 
DOLLY First time you came to pick up Katie, you brought me flowers. Just like those. (to herself) Flower the mother; then deflower the daughter. But Katie was too smart for you... 
WILLS Dolly, look -- 
DOLLY (abruptly) Aw, why the hell don't you leave her alone? Christ, she's sick! 
But before Wills can answer, they hear footsteps on the stairs. Neither moves. 
Charlotte enters, wearing a peasant dress and felt hat, looking pretty, pale, and excited. 
Wills and Dolores slowly turn. They smile at her, then exchange a quick glance. Charlotte catches it and becomes self-conscious -- 
CHARLOTTE What? What's wrong? 
DOLLY You look like your mom is all. 
Charlotte looks to Wills to see if that's, indeed, what he was thinking. He nods his agreement. She is pleased. 
EXT. GREENWICH VILLAGE STREET -- MINUTES LATER 
Charlotte, full of energy, hauls Wills down the block by the hand. 
WILLS What do you mean, you knew? 
CHARLOTTE I did! I just didn't think it would take so long! 
WILLS I think that goes without saying. 
CHARLOTTE It was true when that poem was written three hundred years ago and it's true today. Wouldn't it be fun to look wanton occasionally? 
WILLS It's been a lifelong dream of mine. But will a scarf do it? 
CHARLOTTE Totally. Accessories rule. But we have to be careful. I don't want you looking too young. Nothing's worse than an old guy trying to look young. 
WILLS Good advice. I'll remember that for when I get old. 
CHARLOTTE You know what I meant. 
WILLS That I'm old. 
CHARLOTTE Uh-huh. 
INT. BARNEY'S LOBBY -- LATER 
Wills walks a little self-consciously. He wears around his shoulders a sloppily draped wrinkly silk scarf. 
He walks past OTHER SHOPPERS. Among a GROUP OF WOMEN walking past him FIND CHARLOTTE who subtly checks him out as though he were a stranger. 
As she passes by, she gives him a sexy look, then, not very subtly, she spins around to look at his ass. 
Finally, she breaks character, runs after him, and throws her arms around his neck from behind. 
CHARLOTTE Perfectly imperfect! 
Laughing, he holds her hands and hauls her on his back to the door. 
INT. ITALIAN RESTAURANT -- NIGHT 
Wills and Charlotte are in the middle of a candlelight dinner. Wills refills her wine glass -- 
WILLS I don't know why, but for some odd reason, I feel absolutely compelled to tell you the truth about this... even at the risk of -- 
CHARLOTTE Hey, you're giving me the creeps. Just spit it out. 
Wills holds his breath for a moment, then exhales and says it -- 
WILLS I never had a date for the benefit. My plan from the beginning was for you to come with me. 
Charlotte sets down her wine glass as she pieces it together -- 
CHARLOTTE So I made the hat for myself? (He nods.) And you bought that dress for me? (He nods.) And you did all this just so you could sleep with me? (He nods.) Why? I mean, why me? 
Wills settles himself, then, meeting her eyes, speaks softly -- 
WILLS The eulogy you gave at Ella's service was so... impressive. You spoke about her death... about loss... in a way that I could never have done. You understood life emotionally in a way that I didn't. Whatever that understanding was, I wanted to get close to it. 
CHARLOTTE And sex seemed like the best way to do it. 
WILLS And the most enjoyable, yeah. 
Charlotte sips her wine and considers. Then she sets down her glass -- 
CHARLOTTE Well, first of all, let me say, you have great taste because that little Dolce & Gabbana was to die for. 
WILLS Thanks. 
CHARLOTTE And, second, don't ever lie to me again. 
WILLS All right. 
CHARLOTTE Seriously. There isn't a lie in the whole world I'd rather hear than the truth. 
Wills stares at her solemnly. Her expression just as somber, she lifts a hand and points to her lips. He leans forward to kiss her. 
INT. WILLS' BEDROOM -- NIGHT 
Wills and Charlotte, kissing deeply, tumble fully clothed onto the bed. As their passion builds, Wills reaches for the bedside lamp. 
Charlotte watches curiously, thoughtfully, as he pulls the cord, plunging the room into UTTER DARKNESS. 
MUSIC UP: A SEQUENCE BEGINS 
-- Savoring the last sunny days of autumn, Wills and Charlotte walk across the green of Central Park, which swarms with happy, healthy teenagers. 
-- At night, Wills and John and his wife Sarah sit in box seats at Yankee Stadium watching the play-offs. Bernie Williams hits a colossal shot. The crowd jumps to its feet. As the ball flies over the right field wall, we see that Charlotte sits next to Wills, munching a hotdog, her nose buried in a book, utterly uninterested. 
-- In Elysium's kitchen, Wills watches on as Charlotte, wearing an apron over her clothes, prepares bisque under the approving eye of the CHEF. She quickly and expertly pours a cup of cream and a cup of broth into a large blender. Then she dumps in lobster meat and adds some saffron. Just when she, with a dramatic flourish, is about to hit the start button, Wills INTERRUPTS and puts the lid on the blender. 
-- One morning, Charlotte sits up in bed doing the Sunday New York Times crossword puzzle. Olivia sits on the chair next to the bed, chatting and laughing with her. Wills enters, carrying a silver tray laden with breakfast. Olivia looks up and gestures haughtily for him to set it down, as though he were the housekeeper. 
-- At the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Wills and Charlotte wander amid the shadows of Egyptian ruins. 
MUSIC OUT. 
He begins to undress. His hands are uncertain as he untucks his shirt and unbuckles his belt. When he is finished undressing, he turns to face her, his arms at his side. 
Although we cannot see him in the moonlight and shadows, Charlotte can. She looks down at his naked body and studies it. He stares back with shy wariness. 
Then she breaks into a crooked grin -- 
CHARLOTTE What's the matter, old man? Can't afford a gym? 
WILLS That's it! 
Laughing, he grabs her wrists and throws her on the bed. She dissolves into paroxysms of laughter. 
INT. WILLS BEDROOM -- LATER 
Wills and Charlotte make love. As their passion builds, Charlotte is suddenly stabbed with a pain in her chest. 
She grabs his back, her face twists. She holds her breath, not wanting to reveal the incident to Wills. She closes her eyes and exhales as the pain subsides. 
INT. WILLS' BEDROOM -- LATER 
Wills and Charlotte lie in bed with the blinds open and the city glimmering in the distance. 
Charlotte's head rests on his chest. Eyes closed, he brushes his hand along her face as though he were a blind man committing every detail to memory. 
Charlotte's voice, almost inaudible, drifts up through the dark -- 
CHARLOTTE "Counting the beats, Counting the slow heart beats, The bleeding to death of time In slow heart beats, Wakeful they lie." 
Wills, half-asleep, murmurs deeply -- 
WILLS So many words in that wonderful head of yours... 
CHARLOTTE If I could give you anything in the whole world, that's what it would be. 
WILLS Words? 
CHARLOTTE Poetry. 
They lie in silence. 
EXT. CENTRAL PARK WEST -- LATE AFTERNOON 
Dusk falls on the park. Charlotte, red-cheeked and happy, carrying shopping bags, walks into a brisk autumn breeze. 
She smiles at a BUNCH OF SCHOOL KIDS, dressed in HALLOWEEN COSTUMES, being led on their trick or treating. 
INT. ELYSIUM REAR OFFICE -- AFTERNOON 
Wills sits at a desk, reading the newspaper. John, inspecting a KING HENRY VIII COSTUME on a hanger, shouts into the telephone -- 
JOHN Oh no, your boy made it! At ten minutes before close! All night I got a card announcing a halibut special, only I got no halibut! Now it's Sunday and I got three dozen cats lickin' their chops in the alley! Tony, I don't wanna hear it! I don't wanna hear it! I don't wanna -- MAN, GO TO HELL! 
He slams down the phone. His face is beet red. Wills looks up calmly from his paper -- 
WILLS Are you familiar with the phrase, "You can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar?" 
JOHN Are you familiar with the phrase, "Mind your own god damn business?" 
WILLS Sure, it's from Poor Richard's Almanac. But the last time I checked -- 
JOHN No, your business is to smile, make friends, and get rich! My business is the business. 
John heads out, then stops abruptly and looks back. His tone is suddenly calm and curious -- 
JOHN What're you doin' here, anyway? You got a girl. Go home. Carve a pumpkin. 
WILLS We can't spend every waking moment together. 
John looks at him strangely, with a hint of suspicion -- 
JOHN Why not? (pause) No, seriously. Why not? 
Wills has no answer. John moves closer when Celia, his new assistant, enters cheerily -- 
CELIA Special delivery! 
She tosses him a paper bag; he catches it. 
WILLS No trouble? 
CELIA None. 
Wills removes a PAIR OF RED PLASTIC HORNS. John shakes his head with disbelief. 
JOHN Every year. You got no imagination. 
WILLS It's a classic. A little spirit gum and voila! 
Wills and Charlotte stare straight ahead, each lost in thought. The lights of the city illuminate their faces in eerie flashes. 
Finally, Wills glances over and smiles -- 
WILLS I have a strange feeling that you're upset with me. 
CHARLOTTE No, I was just wondering if you had sex with that woman. 
WILLS Ever? 
CHARLOTTE No, the answer to that's pretty obvious. I meant tonight. On the roof. 
Wills breaks into a grin -- 
WILLS You're not serious. 
Wills laughs to himself, then glances up and sees the reflection of the driver's amused eyes in the rearview mirror. Wills smiles back at Charlotte -- 
WILLS Of course not. Why would I want to do something like that? 
CHARLOTTE That's what I was wondering. I thought, "We're so happy he'd have no reason to do it. And if he did do it, he'd at least look guilty, wouldn't he? But he doesn't. He looks more relaxed than before the party started." 
WILLS Well, there you have it. 
CHARLOTTE But then I thought, "He's a womanizer -- that's what they say." Funny word, huh? Sounds like some sorta machine. "And how do you get to be a womanizer? Obviously by sleeping with lots of different women for no good reason and being really good at lying about it." 
WILLS Sure, except that -- 
CHARLOTTE Let me finish. 
Again, Wills looks up at the driver's eyes in the mirror. They seem more serious now. 
CHARLOTTE Anyway, there's something about being sick right here -- 
She touches her own chest. Her voice trembles slightly -- 
CHARLOTTE -- that has made me acutely aware of my heart. Nothing corny -- I mean, literally... I feel every beat. I know how sensitive it is. It reacts to everything. 
She turns in her seat and lifts an OPEN PALM. 
CHARLOTTE If you're lying to me, I'll know it. (beat) Did you have sex with Wendy on the roof? 
He smiles at her as though he were indulging a child. She looks him deeply in the eye and opens a button of his shirt. 
She slips her palm inside, over his heart. 
Still smiling, he doesn't move a muscle. 
Their eyes are locked. 
Ever so slowly, her face crumples and tears appear in her eyes. She shakes her head -- 
CHARLOTTE My God... oh my God. 
She slides away from him, drops her face into her hands, and begins to cry. Wills looks down, then glances up at the rearview mirror. 
Illuminated in flashes, the driver's eyes have taken on an ominous, unblinking quality as though they were the outward embodiment of his own conscience. 
Wills looks out the window. When he finally speaks, his voice is calm and a little cold -- 
WILLS Look, I never pretended to be anything other than -- 
CHARLOTTE (a piteous cry) You hate yourself so much! 
Wills is stunned. He looks out the window, speechless, his eyes small and frightened. 
EXT. CHARLOTTE'S BROWNSTONE -- NIGHT 
The town car is stopped at the curb, motor running, lights on. 
INT. TOWN CAR -- SAME 
Charlotte and Wills sit in silence -- 
WILLS This was all a mistake. Right from the start. All of it. I'm a grown man and you're a child. (beat) Anyway, you have better things to do with your last -- With your time than spend it with me. 
CHARLOTTE (distantly) What about you? Do you have anything better? 
Wills has no answer. Charlotte slowly gets out of the car. She leans back in, her eyes narrow with disdain -- 
CHARLOTTE You know, maybe you're right. Maybe this is the best time to end it. Because I was actually starting to love you, Wills, and that's the last thing I ever wanted. 
She shuts the door. 
INT. BROWNSTONE FOYER -- NIGHT 
As Charlotte enters, we hear Wills' cab pull away. She moves to the stairs and sees a LIGHT shining beneath the living room door. 
FADE IN: 
EXT. UPPER EAST SIDE -- NIGHT 
From amid the RUSH OF TRAFFIC, a TAXI CAB breaks free and glides to the curb in front of Elysium. 
Wills emerges with PATTY, 35, bosomy, bright-eyed, pitched a little too loudly. Wills seems stiff and tentative, a shadow of his former self. 
INT. ELYSIUM -- CONTINUOUS 
AN ELDERLY COUPLE passes them as they enter. Wills stops at the coat check and helps Patty with her coat. She admires the decor -- 
PATTY Oh, Wills, it's beautiful! 
Although his spirits are low, he is effortlessly cordial -- 
WILLS Thank you. It was designed by a team from -- 
PATTY So functional! Is that stainless steel? 
WILLS Actually, no, it's velvet. 
She furrows her brow, squints, then laughs. 
PATTY Oh, my God, it is! 
Wills hands Patty's coat to Melissa, the hat check girl, and asks under his breath -- 
WILLS How are you? 
Looking at Patty, Melissa asks with deep sympathy -- 
MELISSA How are you, sir? 
Before Wills can respond, Patty takes his arm -- 
PATTY Well, if the food's even half as good as the moldings I'm in for a very special treat. 
Jesus is surprised to see that Wills is not with Charlotte -- 
JESUS Uhhh, good evening, Mr. Keane. Will you be dining with us? 
WILLS Yes, Jesus. Table seven, if it's available. 
JESUS Certainly, sir. 
Celia approaches, equally surprised not to see Charlotte -- 
WILLS Hello, Celia. 
CELIA (sincerely) How are you this evening, sir? 
WILLS I've been worse. 
CELIA (under her breath) Are you sure? 
The NEW HOSTESS, Celia's replacement, arrives. 
JESUS Table Seven. 
NEW HOSTESS This way, please. 
WILLS (to Patty) Order a drink. I'll be right with you. 
Patty follows Celia. Wills moves to the reservation stand where John stands, stone-faced, flipping through the reservation book -- 
JOHN Where the hell you been? 
WILLS Splendid, how are you? 
JOHN Where's Charlotte? 
WILLS Deliveries on time? 
JOHN Who's the broad? She looks like a Holiday-Inn hooker from Ohio. 
WILLS Keep up the good work! 
Wills walks away. 
INT. DOWNTOWN BAR -- NIGHT 
Dark, smoky, and boisterous. FIND CHARLOTTE, standing with Simon. She looks around disgustedly and shouts above the roar -- 
CHARLOTTE Okay, I'm chugging Scotch, gagging on smoke, and losing my hearing! Now why is this so good for me again?! 
SIMON That's just it! The great spiritual benefit in leaving one's room is that it reminds one of how odious it is to leave one's room! 
WILLS So? 
JOHN So after the party, no thank you! I call you three times -- no call back! And for six days you don't even eat at your own god damn restaurant! What am I supposed to think? Huh?! I was ready to call the morgue! 
WILLS Relax, I'm alive. 
JOHN Well, you sure don't look it! 
EXT. ANOTHER BLOCK -- MINUTE LATER 
John walks as quickly as he can with Wills struggling to keep up -- 
JOHN I'll tell you why it's my concern! Because I had a god damn swimming pool! An ocean view! A fabulous lemon tree hangin' right over my Jacuzzi! And I gave it up for you, brother! Back to a life of concrete and dirt and sirens just so you could get your shit together! 
EXT. ANOTHER BLOCK -- MINUTES LATER 
John, walking a little more slowly now, cannot believe his ears -- 
JOHN On my roof? You gotta be kiddin'! Not on my green chair! Tell me it wasn't on the green chair. 
Wills winces. 
JOHN Oh, great. Now how am I gonna clean that? 
EXT. ANOTHER BLOCK -- MINUTE LATER 
John walks slowly now, backward, listening to an anxious Wills -- 
WILLS Look, it doesn't matter that she's sick -- she's still a kid and there's no way we should be together. It's unhealthy... it's... it's inappropriate... 
JOHN (with disgust) What the hell is that? Some sorta shrink talk? 
WILLS Look, if she were just fun... just some sort of diversion... maybe I could justify it. But the worst part is that it's becoming more. Much more. It's embarrassing how much I like her. She gets to me. She affects me... 
He stops and leans back against a building. He looks around, avoiding eye contact with John, as tears rise into his eyes. 
WILLS And she's gonna be gone and... I'm not sure I can... I mean... I already think about her all the time... (fighting tears) Her smile kills me... and the thought... that it'll be gone... forever... that I'll never see her again... I don't know... I can't -- I don't think I'm that strong, Johnny. It's too much. I'd rather have it be over... over now. I'll start missing her now. 
Wills is still unable to look at him. John speaks softly -- 
JOHN Buddy, I hate to break it to you, but in the real world... where I live... there're only two kindsa love stories. Boy loses girl and girl loses boy. That's all there is. Somebody always gets left behind. You try to avoid that, you'll end up an old man toastin' yourself with egg nog in the mirror on Christmas Eve. You'll end up dying in your own arms. 
Wills lifts his frightened eyes. John pats him on the cheek. 
EXT. HIGH-RISE APARTMENT BUILDING -- NIGHT 
Wills stands with Patty in the driveway in front of the glass lobby. He is distracted and terribly anxious. She looks as though she expects, at the very least, a kiss -- 
PATTY Thank you so much. I had such a great time. 
WILLS Good. I'm... I'm glad. 
PATTY Didn't you? 
WILLS Patty, I... I want to be honest with you... right now, from the start... so there's no room for misunderstanding. I didn't have a good time, but it's nothing personal. I just split up with someone and rather than admit to myself how much I miss her, I asked you out instead. And it's unfair. If I feel sad I should just feel sad and not try to use you... and your body... as some sort of painkiller, right? (beat) Anyway, I think you're a warm and engaging woman and I wish you all the best. 
Relieved to have unburdened himself of the truth, he shakes her hand. Patty, utterly baffled, doesn't know what hit her. 
EXT. WILLS' BUILDING -- LATER 
The doorman Michael, smoking a cigarette, sees Wills walk up, his expression pensive. 
MICHAEL Mr. Keane -- 
WILLS Good night, Michael. 
MICHAEL You've got a visitor. 
Wills stops and turns -- 
WILLS Who? 
MICHAEL She's been waitin' almost an hour. In the lobby. (off Wills' look) A little surprise for ya. 
He winks. Wills realizes that it's Charlotte. It must be. He smiles and hurries inside. 
INT. WILLS' LOBBY -- CONTINUOUS 
Wills bursts in and freezes. A WOMAN stands across the way, studying an oil painting. She turns quickly. It's LISA. She sees his excited expression fall. Beneath her rather composed facade, Lisa is a chaos of conflicting emotions -- 
LISA Sorry to disappoint you. 
WILLS No, no. Not at all. You surprised me, that's all. I didn't expect to see you... not here... not after your letter. 
LISA Well, I didn't expect you to show up at my job. 
WILLS I followed you in. I wasn't even sure it was you. All I have is an old snapshot. 
Looking down from the second-floor landing, we see Charlotte enter and walk up the stairs toward us. 
As she reaches the landing, she feels a STABBING PAIN IN HER CHEST and stops walking. Wincing, she waits for the pain to subside. 
INT. CHARLOTTE'S BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS 
Charlotte enters wearily, drops her purse on the floor, then turns and GASPS. 
Wills lies sprawled in an armchair fully dressed, sound asleep. 
Charlotte is offended by the intrusion. She hurries over to awaken him. But then she stops. Her face softens slightly. 
She studies his face... touches his cheek with the back of her hand... traces the lines at his eyes with a fingertip.. smooths back a wisp of hair. 
Finally, snapping to, steeling herself, she jostles him -- 
CHARLOTTE Hey. 
Wills wakes with a violent start. When he sees her, he drops his head back. He closes his eyes again and murmurs sleepily -- 
WILLS Where were you? I was worried. 
CHARLOTTE So worried you fell asleep. What're you doing here? 
WILLS I've missed you. You have no idea how much. 
She crosses coldly to her closet and, half-shutting the door, blocking his view, starts to undress. 
CHARLOTTE How'd you get in? 
He sits up, rubbing his eyes in the morning light. 
WILLS Dolly. We watched TV. She fell asleep. What time is it? 
CHARLOTTE I didn't know I had a curfew. 
WILLS Where were you? 
CHARLOTTE None of your business. So what is it? What do you want? 
Wills sits forward, more alert now. He exhales heavily and begins: 
WILLS To tell you that you were right. I do hate myself. But not so much that I can't see how stupid and despicable and -- 
CHARLOTTE Cowardly. 
WILLS And cowardly what I did was. And even though there's no excuse for it, I want you to forgive me. 
She turns and looks at him. She feels herself relenting. She turns away and continues undressing -- 
CHARLOTTE Why should I? 
WILLS Because, for better or worse, I'm falling in love with you, and the thought of our not being together is unbearable to me. 
She stops, then glances at him with a flash of pain and longing. Determined not to surrender to her feelings, she crosses to the bed and throws open the covers. 
CHARLOTTE Let's sleep. 
She crawls into bed. 
CHARLOTTE In the morning, we'll talk about what a gigantic asshole you are. 
Wills, relieved, crosses to the bed and begins to undress. He asks casually -- 
WILLS So where were you? 
CHARLOTTE With Shannon and Simon and Eric. 
WILLS Who's Eric? 
CHARLOTTE An old friend who used to work at Blockbuster. 
WILLS What'd you guys do? 
CHARLOTTE Talked and drank. Simon and Shannon finally went home. Eric and I hung out. 
Thinking nothing of it, Wills nods. He slips into bed. Her back is to him. He drapes an arm around her and pulls her a little closer. 
He smiles contentedly and closes his eyes. But then something occurs to him. He opens his eyes -- 
WILLS Hung out where? 
CHARLOTTE Stop. We'll talk about it tomorrow. 
WILLS Fine. 
He closes his eyes again. A few beats later, they open. 
INT. MACDONALD'S -- DAY 
Wills sits with John, Sarah, and the twins at a plastic table overrun with food, wrappers, and squashed condiment tubes. Sarah speaks to Wills -- 
SARAH Judge you? Why would I? Screw the age difference -- I like the new you! Before Charlotte came along, do you have any idea how hard it was to get you to sit down for a Happy Meal? 
Wills and John laugh. Molly, one of the twins, chimes in -- 
MOLLY Uncle Wills, how come you don't get married? 
JOHN Yeah, how come, Uncle Wills? 
WILLS I want to, Carla, but -- 
MOLLY I'm not Carla! I'm Molly! 
WILLS Well, Molly, I just haven't met the right woman yet. 
CARLA What about Charlotte? She's funny- pretty. 
SARAH (aside to Wills) It means funny and pretty. It's their highest compliment. 
WILLS I agree. (rising from the table) She's also demanding. 
JOHN Where're you goin'? 
WILLS She's decided she wants her birthday present today. 
Wills gives both of the little girls hugs and kisses. 
JOHN But that was last month. 
WILLS The Dom didn't count. This is her real present. She chose it herself and it's not material. 
JOHN Now you got me curious. 
SARAH Yeah, what is it? 
Wills shakes his head and smiles, reluctant to answer. 
From the next scene we hear the sound of TWO DOZEN PEOPLE BREATHING FURIOUSLY. 
INT. STUDIO -- AFTERNOON 
On a slightly elevated stage, HARI SINGH, 35, an American Sikh wearing a white robe and turban, sits in the lotus position before a lighted candle, softly instructing the crowded class -- 
HARI Okay... breath of fire... now inhale deeply... hold the breath... let your heart lotus blossom... feel the energy rise... and exhale. Good. Now peacock pose. 
Hari rolls forward, digs his elbows into his midsection, and pops up so that he is parallel to the floor with his legs still crossed. 
ANGLE ON THE CLASS, all moving into the pose. In the center of the class are Wills and Charlotte, wearing sweats. His arms shaking, Wills is clearly in pain. He mutters -- 
WILLS When does the enlightenment start? 
CHARLOTTE When you realize that I'm God. 
Wills laughs. A moment later, Charlotte winces and falls out of the pose onto the mat. Hari looks over, confused -- 
HARI Are you all right? 
Charlotte sits up quickly, smiling -- 
CHARLOTTE Yeah. No big deal. Cramp in the old fifth shakra! 
She glances over at Wills. He sees that she's scared to death. He helps her to her feet, speaking softly in her ear -- 
WILLS Don't worry. You're gonna be okay. 
She nods. They move toward the door. But after a few steps, her eyes flutter, her body goes limp, and she slams down on the mat, UNCONSCIOUS. 
INT. SPEEDING AMBULANCE -- AFTERNOON 
Charlotte lies on a stretcher near Wills and a PARAMEDIC -- 
CHARLOTTE It's no big deal. I just hyperventilated. Really. 
But then she gasps as she's hit by a stab of pain. Wills throws a grave look at the medic and squeezes her hand more tightly. 
EXT. ST. VINCENT'S HOSPITAL -- ESTABLISHING -- NIGHT 
The building is brightly illuminated against the night sky. 
INT. ST. VINCENT'S WAITING ROOM -- NIGHT 
Wills sits, anxiously struggling with a half-finished crossword puzzle. He hears the click of a lighter. A GRUBBY LITTLE MAN standing by the coffee machine lights a generic cigarette. 
WILLS Excuse me... do you have an extra one of those? 
CHARLOTTE But I want everything from you, Wills. I rely on you in every way. 
WILLS I know. 
CHARLOTTE So the only reason you don't dump me is because I'm sick? Because you know that it's all going to be over, anyway? 
WILLS Maybe. But it doesn't feel that way. (beat) It feels as though I'm not afraid anymore. 
She looks at him and smiles. He puts an arm around her and draws her close. 
INT. TAXI -- AFTERNOON 
Wills looks out the window, his arm draped around Charlotte who lies nestled against him, eyes closed. 
He suddenly sees something. He thinks. Checks his watch. His eyes ignite and he calls out excitedly to the driver -- 
WILLS Driver! Quick! Pull over here! Right here! 
Charlotte, a little sleepy, comes to. She looks out the window and her face softens with happiness. 
EXT. THE BRICK CHURCH, 92ND AND PARK -- SAME 
On the steps of the old church a CHOIR sings Christmas carols. All around them, a LARGE CROWD sings along. 
Wills and Charlotte get out of the cab. His arm around her, Wills pulls her into the crowd. They join the carol. Wills sings well. Charlotte is tone deaf. 
In between lines of the song, she calls out -- 
CHARLOTTE I didn't know you could sing! 
WILLS I didn't know you couldn't! 
She laughs and continues to sing. 
THE CAROLS ENDS to cheers and applause. THE CHOIRMASTER steps forward to a microphone -- 
CHOIRMASTER Well, you all know what time it is! 
CHARLOTTE (confused to Wills) No, I don't. Do you? 
He grins. The choirmaster nods at someone in the distance. Then holds up a hand, fingers spread, and begins to count down. The crowd joins in -- 
CHOIRMASTER AND CROWD TEN, NINE, EIGHT, SEVEN, SIX, FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE! 
At that instant, ALL THE WHITE CHRISTMAS LIGHTS on the trees of the median from 96th Street to 44th Street POP ON SIMULTANEOUSLY -- an enchanted fairy-tale spectacle. 
The crowd and the choir cheer and clap, cars honk their horns. Charlotte's eyes are filled with happy wonder. 
CHOIRMASTER HAPPY HOLIDAYS! 
As another carol begins, Wills wraps his arms around Charlotte and kisses her. He pulls away, looks deeply into her eyes, and whispers with passionate sincerity -- 
WILLS I love you, Charlotte. 
For an instant, her eyes flare as though she were surprised. Then her eyes fill with tears. She tries to speak but she is choked by a sob. 
She buries her face in his chest and cries. Wills smiles with warm, almost paternal, indulgence. He strokes her hair. She hugs him as though she'll never let go. 
INT. ELYSIUM -- NIGHT 
The restaurant is packed. John, overwhelmed by the crowd waiting for tables, glances angrily away when he hears the phone ringing and no one answering it. 
INT. ELYSIUM KITCHEN -- SAME 
Amid the Pandemonium, Wills watches as Charlotte teases HENRY, 30, the young chef, as he lays the beet garnishes on a fish entree. 
CHARLOTTE You call that a rose? It looks more like a hand grenade! 
HENRY Mr. Keane, you get her outta here or, I swear to God, I'm gonna butterfly and stuff her! 
WILLS I'll add it to the specials list. 
CHARLOTTE (laughing) No way! I'm too pricey! 
The door bangs open. John enters, looking angry -- 
CHARLOTTE Hello, Sunshine! 
JOHN You seen Celia? 
WILLS What's the matter? 
JOHN The matter is I got a half-hour wait and no help up front! You got a call on Two! 
INT. ELYSIUM OFFICE -- SAME 
Wills enters, picks up the phone, and hits a flashing button-- 
He smiles at her. And she smiles back. 
INT. WILLS' BEDROOM -- MORNING 
Charlotte lies asleep with her head on his chest. She opens her eyes. The room seems strange. It's the light. 
She rises up and turns around. Her eyes narrow with curiosity. She crawls out of bed and runs to the window and looks out. 
She can't believe her eyes. Central Park is blanketed by deep snow and more is falling. She calls out gaily -- 
CHARLOTTE Hey! How do you feel about Christmas? 
WILLS (sleepily) Bah humbug... 
She runs back, laughing, and jumps on the bed, rousting him. 
MUSIC UP: 
A SEQUENCE BEGINS showing Charlotte and Wills during a day of holiday shopping. The deep snow has slowed the city to a crawl but filled everyone with good spirits. 
Charlotte and Wills move from store to store; they buy wreaths, garlands, ornaments, candles, and, finally, a CHRISTMAS TREE and STAND. 
Wills starts to lug the tree, but when it's obvious that it's too much for him, Charlotte spots a GROUP OF KIDS spilling out of a record store. 
The next thing we know the kids are lined up, carrying the tree over their heads like a battalion of ants. 
Wills and the kids load the tree into the freight elevator and squeeze in. There's no room for Charlotte. She'll take the lobby elevator. 
MUSIC OUT: 
INT. LOBBY ELEVATOR -- AFTERNOON 
Charlotte, carrying shopping bags, ascends in silence with Michael. She has no interest in chatting. He, as ever, does. 
MICHAEL Will you and Mister Keane be goin' away for the holidays? 
CHARLOTTE I doubt it. 
MICHAEL I've seen so little of America. I don't care for airplanes, you see, and I have so little time to travel. (beat) Did Mister Keane enjoy his trip then? 
CHARLOTTE What trip? 
MICHAEL Why, just yesterday. 
CHARLOTTE I wouldn't really call that a trip. 
MICHAEL Perhaps not. But I've never been to Ohio myself. They say parts of it are quite lovely. 
Charlotte goes pale. The elevator stops and he opens the door. 
INT. WILLS' FOYER -- CONTINUOUS 
Charlotte steps out right into the kids who are roughhousing and laughing. Each holds a five-dollar bill -- 
MICHAEL (calling out) All right, you little hellions! Get in here! 
INT. WILLS' LIVING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER 
Charlotte wanders in. The tree stands erect. Wills, on all fours, tightens the screws on the stand. He crawls to his feet and studies it. 
WILLS Straight? 
Then he sees her grave expression and freezes. 
CHARLOTTE I thought we had a deal. 
WILLS I'm sure we do. About what? 
CHARLOTTE Lying. (beat) You were in Ohio yesterday. 
Wills stares at her for a moment, then explains without apology -- 
WILLS I met with a heart specialist. He's willing to operate. 
For an instant she is surprised, but then her indignation takes over -- 
CHARLOTTE But you know I don't want that! You know I've signed papers that -- 
WILLS Well, maybe I want it. 
CHARLOTTE It isn't your decision! 
WILLS Of course not, but if you'll hear me out -- 
CHARLOTTE No! I told you right from the start how I felt and you went behind my back! You lied and -- 
WILLS (exploding) Oh, Christ, knock it off! You're such a god damn saint, so above it all, but you're scared to death! You do want to live! And if you were as honest as you say you are you'd let the doctors do whatever they can to help you! 
THE STAR LIGHTS UP. He jumps down and puts the chair away. Then he runs over and dims the lights -- 
WILLS Finishing touches! 
He runs over and adjusts a garland. He runs back to the dimmer and adjusts it again -- 
WILLS Almost! 
He runs back to the bedroom door and flings it open. 
WILLS Voila! 
He looks into the room and freezes in the doorway. He backs up a step, then, crying out, lunges into the room. 
MUSIC UP: 
EXT. WILLS' BUILDING -- NIGHT 
Charlotte, lying unconscious on a stretcher, wearing an oxygen mask, is rushed into a waiting ambulance. Wills, beside himself with panic, is gently barred by a MEDIC from jumping in with her. 
INT. NEW HAVEN HOSPITAL LECTURE HALL -- NIGHT 
In the reflection of a projected slide, a hand offers a CELLULAR PHONE to Dr. Grandy, standing at a lectern in front of a group of doctors. He stops his lecture and takes the call. 
EXT. MANHATTAN STREET -- NIGHT 
The ambulance rushes, light flashing, sirens wailing, downtown. 
INT. ST. VINCENT'S HOSPITAL -- NIGHT 
Charlotte's stretcher is rushed into the emergency room at the same time that Wills' cab pulls up. 
EXT. NEW HAVEN HOSPITAL HELIPORT -- NIGHT 
Grandy is rushed into a MEDICAL HELICOPTER. 
INT. CORONARY CARE UNIT WAITING ROOM -- NIGHT 
Wills looks up and sees Dolores and Shannon arrive. 
EXT. SKY -- NIGHT 
Grandy's helicopter speeds toward the City. 
INT. CORONARY CARE UNIT WAITING ROOM -- NIGHT 
Wills comforts Shannon. Dolores looks up and sees Simon standing in the doorway. Then a CORONARY CARE NURSE appears. She asks to speak to Wills. 
INT. MEDICAL HELICOPTER -- NIGHT 
Grandy looks out the window as the helicopter swoops down toward the lights of lower Manhattan. 
INT. CORONARY CARE UNIT PRE-OP -- NIGHT 
Charlotte lies, semi-conscious, on a gurney. Wills appears in the doorway with the nurse. 
EXT. ST. VINCENT'S HOSPITAL HELIPORT -- NIGHT 
The helicopter lands and Grandy jumps out. 
MUSIC OUT: 
INT. CORONARY CARE UNIT PRE-OP -- NIGHT 
Wills sits down next to Charlotte's bed. He touches her hand. Her eyes open then close again. Her breathing is heavy and labored. 
Wills pushes a lock of hair off her brow, then whispers, half to himself -- 
WILLS Time cannot break the bird's wing from the bird. Bird and wing together Go down, one feather. No thing that ever flew, not the lark, not you, Can die as others do. 
Charlotte's eyes open dreamily. She shows a faint smile at the poem and murmurs almost inaudibly -- 
CHARLOTTE What have I done to you? 
WILLS Ruined me for other women. 
CHARLOTTE No... I saved you for them... 
Her eyes close. Wills takes her hand and presses it to his cheek. 
MALE VOICE Is she type 'n' cross for six units?! 
NURSE'S VOICE Yes, Doctor. 
Wills turns around and sees Grandy standing in the doorway. 
GRANDY What're we waiting for?

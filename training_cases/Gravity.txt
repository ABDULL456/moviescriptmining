MISSION CONTROL (ON RADIO) Kowalsky? 
MATT Not a problem. 
Matt toggles a switch and the music stops. 
RYAN Thank you, Kowalsky. 
Ryan moves the Card around. 
RYAN (CONT'D) Now, Houston? MISSION CONTROL Negative. 
RYAN Could Houston be misinterpreting the data--? 
MISSION CONTROL (ON RADIO) We're not receiving any data. Engineering is recommending a vis- check for component damage. 
Again, as if to herself- 
RYAN Mmmm. Let me see what's going on. 
She starts to disengage one of the panels. 
RYAN (CONT'D) (MUMBLES) What have you got here? 
Ryan takes out a card from under the plate and begins to examine it. Matt begins to approach her. 
RYAN (CONT'D) Visual examination doesn't reveal any damaged components. The problem must be originating in the comms panel. 
MISSION CONTROL (ON RADIO) That seems to be the case. Engineering admits that you warned us that this could happen. That's as close to an apology as you're going to get from them. We should've listened to you doc. 
Without losing any time, Ryan puts the card back into the TELESCOPE- 
RYAN I'm on it. 
MISSION CONTROL (ON RADIO) Copy that. How long do you think it'll take you? 
Matt begins a wide loop around the telescope. RYAN An hour. 
MISSION CONTROL (ON RADIO) Outstanding. We appreciate your patience, Doctor. Installing your system in the Hubble is the main purpose of this mission. 
Ryan doesn't respond, continuing to work. Matt closes in as he circles the telescope. 
MISSION CONTROL (CONT'D) Houston trusts Mission Commander Kowalsky realizes that this delay is not of sufficient duration to enable him to surpass Anatoly's Solovyev's spacewalking record, as most recent calculations indicate that he will be left... 
MATT Seventy-five minutes shy. Never crossed my mind. 
MISSION CONTROL (ON RADIO) Matt, It's been a privilege. 
Matt hesitates ever-so-briefly, then... 
MATT Right back atcha, Houston. 
MISSION CONTROL (ON RADIO) Enjoy your last walk... 
MATT Am I a go to assist Dr. Stone in removing the panel? 
RYAN Assistance appreciated. 
MISSION CONTROL (ON RADIO) Permission granted. MATT Thank you, Houston. (TO RYAN) Mind if I join the fun? 
RYAN Certainly. 
Ryan begins unbolting. Matt lands right next to Ryan and grabs onto the telescope. She is frustrated, determined. 
MATT How are you feeling? 
RYAN Like a Chihuahua that's being tumble dried. 
Matt takes out his pistol grip, and with fast precision puts its head to a bolt and begins unscrewing. Matt removes the bolt with confidence. 
MATT It's been a rough week. If it makes you feel any better, I puked up everything but my kidneys on my first ride. 
Ryan is not as precise with her pistol grip, and when a bolt COMES OFF- 
She DROPS IT. 
RYAN Whoa...! AWOL! 
The bolt spins floating away. She tries to grab it but MISSES, barely touching it but brushing it just enough to give it a push that makes it change direction.... 
She turns and reaches out to grab it, but she is strapped to the Robotic Arm. 
The bolt spins out into the emptiness of space when- 
Matt thrusts himself over to Ryan. 
EXPLORER CAP (CONT'D) (ON RADIO) Houston, this is Explorer. Copy? 
But there's no answer. 
EXPLORER CAP (CONT'D) (ON RADIO) Houston, this is Explorer. Copy? 
Still no answer. EXPLORER CAP (CONT'D) (ON RADIO) We lost Houston! 
Matt stops next to Ryan. 
MATT Unstrap! You can't tune out the world up here. 
She reaches for the last clip and begins to undo it. 
RYAN I'm trying... 
MATT Try releasing the safety clip. 
Shariff makes his way back toward the airlock as- 
A PIECE of the debris HITS the Hubble's SOLAR PANELS, making a 12-inch HOLE in its golden surface. 
A piece of debris passes, nearly hitting them. 
SHARIFF Need some help there Matt? 
MATT No, don't wait for us. Get inside. 
RYAN It's stuck! 
Further back, another piece of debris collides with a bigger one. The two chunks of debris explode into a million pieces of shrapnel, one of which- 
HITS Shariff's helmet, breaking through the glass and hitting his head like an expansive bullet. 
MATT Man down! Man down! 
Matt PROPELS himself toward Shariff, who is floating away from the Shuttle unconscious. 
MATT (CONT'D) (TO RYAN) Disengage!!! 
AN IMPACT. A piece of debris pierces through the right wing of the Space Shuttle, creating a five-foot hole. 
THE SPACE SHUTTLE ROLLS. 
The arm, with Ryan attached to it, rolls with the Shuttle. 
MATT (CONT'D) Explorer has been hit. Explorer do you read? Explorer, over. Explorer-- 
Another IMPACT. 
A piece of debris HITS the robotic arm like a cannon ball and DETACHES it from the Shuttle. 
The broken piece of the arm SPINS AWAY from the Explorer at a great speed with Ryan attached to it. She passes next to- 
THE HUBBLE as a big piece of debris hits the telescope. The top of the cylinder explodes into more debris, which is expelled in all directions, barely missing Ryan as she spins away attached to the arm. 
ON THE ARM- 
Ryan's panic grows as she spins further into the nothingness of space. 
MATT (CONT'D) Astronaut off structure! Dr. Stone is off structure! 
With every spin, the shuttle, being punished by debris, diminishes into a tiny dot in the distance. 
MATT (CONT'D) (ON RADIO) Dr. Stone, detach! 
RYAN Nooooo! 
MATT (ON RADIO) You must detach! 
RYAN No. 
MATT If you don't detach that arm is going to carry you too far! RYAN (FROZEN) I can't! 
MATT (a brief beat, then) Listen to my voice. You need to focus. I'm losing visual of you. In a few seconds I won't be able to track you. 
RYAN (She pulls herself together) Ok. Ok. 
MATT You need to detach. I can't see you anymore. 
The robotic arm keeps on spinning and stars orbit wildly in her field of vision. 
Ryan's choking. The lack of oxygen is making her veins pop out and her lips turn blue. 
Her eyes open wide, and- 
She exhales. 
OHH... 
And begins breathing deeply. 
AHHHHHH... OHHHHHH.... 
As her breathing steadies, she begins to focus, her eyes searching the distance. THROUGH THE HELMET- 
Ryan can see her face reflected against the visor, lit by the control panels. 
She dims the light and she can see- 
Her legs and arms floating against endless space as she drifts towards the empty void, broken only by lonesome stars whose position change as she rotates, giving way to- 
THE EARTH, 
Very still and very distant. Night is creeping across the sphere as the sun sets, a sliver of light on the Western Hemisphere. 
A metallic object floating over the Earth is hit by a RAY of the sinking sun, and it gleams like a tiny star. Her eyes blink in recognition, gleaming with alertness. 
Her intellect engages and she gains a new sense of calm. 
RYAN (CONT'D) Houston, this is Dr. Ryan Stone.. I'm drifting but I have a visual of Explorer. 
Her eyes scan the enveloping darkness, trying to get a fix on the gleaming orb that is earth, her face alive with concentration as she makes calculations. 
RYAN (CONT'D) With North at 12 o'clock, the Shuttle is at the center of the dial. 
She frowns as she tumbles backward again, recalculating. 
The sun is slipping behind the Earth. She studies the rim of fire until it too slides from view. 
RYAN (CONT'D) I can see the Chinese station. No, no, no, it's the International Space Station. 
The sun's glow illuminates another object in the distance, a bright spec hovering over the horizon- the INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. 
RYAN (CONT'D) ISS is at 6, no, 7 o'clock. 
Just then, the sun's rays recede and the Station DIMS, becoming one with the darkness. Ryan blinks, mildly alarmed. INSIDE THE HELMET- 
RYAN (CONT'D) Lieutenant Kowalsky, do you copy? 
Silence. 
RYAN (CONT'D) Explorer, do you copy? 
Silence. 
Slowly, the sun recedes further behind the earth and the light bathing Ryan's face evaporates. As she is swallowed by the darkness, she speaks once again: 
RYAN (CONT'D) Houston, do you copy? 
THE WHOLE FACE OF THE EARTH IS IN SHADOW. 
And so is Ryan. Her eyes dart. It is utterly silent. She spins in the darkness, waiting. 
RYAN (CONT'D) Houston, this is Mission Specialist Ryan Stone. I'm off structure and I'm drifting. 
There is only the silence, complete and absolute. 
RYAN (CONT'D) Do you copy? 
Nothing. She watches the earth slip from view yet again. 
When next she speaks, the words are as delicate as snowflakes, tripping off her tongue like a prayer... 
RYAN (CONT'D) Anybody...? Anyone...? Please copy. 
A soothing light hits Ryan's face. 
THE MOON is rising over the Pacific Ocean. 
It's almost full and its soft cool light pours over the globe, brightening the deep blue waters and- 
IN THE DISTANCE - 
A LIGHT, not bigger than a star, is FLICKERING. Ryan's eyes focus on the light. Her PUPILS DILATE. Something like tears glistens as she stares at the flickering light, afraid to blink as she watches the... 
MATT See? Where you go, I go. 
Matt ignites a new thrust to re-direct his position. As he does so Ryan's change of momentum makes him swing again. 
MATT (CONT'D) Better. Let's get out of here. Using his thrusters, Matt negotiates a new position and, igniting a long thrust, he jets away. 
Ryan cannot repress the anger boiling up, and SHE SCREAMS- 
RYAN Ahh Dammit! 
MATT I know what you mean. 
RYAN Ahhh Dammit. 
MATT You're burning oxygen, we're going to go back to the shuttle. How's that for a plan. Copy? 
RYAN FUCK 
MATT Right copy that. 
As Matt accelerates toward a lower orbit, his momentum takes over, steadying Ryan's swing. 
MATT (CONT"D) (CONT'D) Houston in the blind, this is Kowalsky. Dr Stone and I are making our way to base, please prepare Airlock for arrival. Copy? 
They descend, gliding through pieces of debris. Among the space junk, a Solar Panel from the Hubble is distinguished. 
Matt eyes a small dot in the distance: the Shuttle. 
MATT (CONT'D) Houston this is Kowalsky. How do you copy? 
RYAN Why aren't they answering? 
MATT It seems like communications are lost. 
RYAN Can they hear us on an alternate frequency? MATT We don't know. That's why we keep talking. If someone is listening they might just save your life. Set your watch for ninety minutes. 
Matt reaches for a digital watch strapped to his wrist and sets up the timer for- 90 MINUTES. 
RYAN Why ninety? 
MATT Houston clocked that debris at fifty thousand miles per hour. Factoring in our current orbit, I reckon we've got 90 minutes before we play duck and cover again. 
Ryan sets her watch, studies the counter as it begins to count down. 
RYAN 02 down to six percent. 
As they travel, the Shuttle begins to take form. 
MATT Okay. Pretty scary shit being untethered up here, isn't it? 
RYAN Yeah. Pretty scary shit. 
MATT (after a beat) You did all right. 
Silence. 
MATT (CONT'D) (to the Shuttle) Houston, in the blind. This is Kowalsky. Our current location is approximately 900 meters out from the Explorer. Dr. Stone and I would like to retrieve the body of Mission Specialist Shariff and return it to Shuttle. Am I a go to retrieve? 
Silence. MATT (CONT'D) Roger that. 
Matt changes direction and approaches Shariff. He has to ignite several small thrusts to try and steady his direction, fighting against Ryan's momentum. 
RYAN Where is he? Where is he? 
Shariff's body is tethered to a PANEL that was ripped away from the Explorer. Matt approaches the panel and ignites the thrusters to slow down his course, and- 
He grabs onto it. Ryan, continuing her momentum, crashes against Shariff's body. The contact slows her trajectory, but it throws Shariff away, his tether tensing, pulling the panel with him. 
RYAN (CONT'D) Oh, my God. Oh, my God. 
Matt, holding on to the metal, spins with it. He detaches Shariff's tether from the panel and attaches it to himself. 
He lets the panel go and immediately ignites his thruster, pulling the two tethers behind him which, as they tense, bring Ryan and Shariff closer together. 
MATT Grab him! 
RYAN I'm trying. I'm trying. 
MATT Quick. You're pulling me away. 
RYAN I got him. I got him. 
Matt tries to ignite a very long thrust in the direction of the Shuttle, but this is difficult as the momentum of the other two bodies pulls him in all directions. 
They are heading toward a small point in the distance, the Space Station, which is in a lower orbit. 
OUTER SPACE. 550 KM ABOVE EARTH. 
We see the two astronauts crossing the distance - a thrust, and they coast ahead, and then another thrust. Matt pulls Ryan behind him. 
Two specks glide across the dark sky as a sliver of light grows on the darkened hemisphere. 
THE SUN IS RISING. WATCHING THE SUNRISE 
THE SUN looks brighter and clearer than ever outside of Earth's atmosphere. The oceans and the continents brighten as its light spills over the Earth beneath them. 
Warm rays of sun caress the two astronauts as they propel themselves across the empty expanse. 
RYAN 02 down to two percent. 
MATT We're getting there. 
MATT (CONT'D) Beautiful, don't you think? 
RYAN What? 
MATT The sunrise. That's what I'm going to miss the most. 
But Ryan is not into the view right now. She's stricken with fear. Her jaw is clenched and her eyes are almost closed. 
Matt looks at the dark emptiness that engulfs him and smiles. 
MATT (CONT'D) So, where's home, Dr. Stone? 
Ryan keeps her eyes closed, doesn't answer. Matt, trying to DISTRACT HER- 
MATT (CONT'D) Ryan. Where's home? 
Ryan opens her eyes, but still she doesn't dare to look out of the helmet. 
RYAN Home? 
MATT Ah ha. Down there. Mother Earth. Where do you pitch your tent? 
RYAN Lake Zurich. 
MATT Where the hell is that? RYAN Illinois. 
MATT Illinois. Central time zone. That makes it roughly... 8pm right now. What are the good people of Lake Zurich doing at 8 o'clock in the evening? 
Ryan tries to overcome her fear and looks out. She frowns, terrified by the sight, and hides her face once more inside the helmet. 
RYAN I don't know... 
MATT What would you be doing? 
She tries again. This time she forces herself and stares out at the Earth, which is over 500 kilometers below her. 
MATT (CONT'D) Come on. It's 8 o'clock. You've just clocked out of the hospital after putting in your customary 18-hour shift. You're driving home... 
Ryan's wide open eyes are transfixed on Earth, like a deer in headlights. 
RYAN The radio. I listen to the radio... 
MATT There we go. Let me guess. NPR? Classical. Top for-- 
RYAN Anything. Doesn't matter. As long as they don't talk. I just drive... 
Her glassy eyes reveal a strong emotion growing inside of her, taking over her body. It is not fear, it is something deeper and more painful. 
Matt studies her curiously. 
MATT What do you miss down there? 
Ryan looks at the Earth. It never felt so far away. A long silence without an answer. 
MATT (CONT'D) Is there a Mr. Stone? 
She frowns, unable to comprehend this initially, as if it were a particularly complicated bit of math, then shakes her head. 
RYAN No... 
MATT Nobody special? Someone down there, looking up, thinking of you? 
Ryan closes her eyes. She remains silent. A silence that can't hide an unspeakable pain. 
RYAN I had a daughter. 
MATT I can't. Can's empty. We're coming in fast and we're going to hit hard. Grab onto anything you can and hold tight! 
Just then Ryan CRASHES against the SOLAR PANEL, but is unable to grab hold. As she tumbles past, the body of the Station looms. 
Matt misses the solar panels, and COLLIDES against the Station. As he begins to drift past, he reaches out and snares a railing. 
Ryan passes flying above him. The tether tenses, pulling Matt. The momentum is to great and he LETS GO of the railing. 
Ryan floats over the roof of the Space Station, trying to grab hold of the handles and rods that stick out of the modules, but she's floating too high. 
She's quickly reaching the end of the Station, there is only one handle left ahead, her last chance before floating away into the black void. 
She extends her arm and GRABS the handle tightly for dear life AND- 
SHE STOPS. 
She's holding onto the handle. 
RYAN I got it. I got it. 
INSIDE THE HELMET- 
She looks up and sees- 
Matt is floating straight toward her and- He COLLIDES against her. For a moment they are face to face, only the glass of their headgear separates their faces. 
But she loses her grip on the handle and the impact projects her into the emptiness. 
Her drifting is intercepted by a Solar Panel. She crashes against it, shattering it, as Matt rolls above it. 
Ryan bounces down towards the Earth, tensing the tether, pulling Matt, making him descend over the other side of the panel. 
The sharp edges of the broken panels cut the tether in two. 
RYAN (CONT'D) The tether broke. I'm detached. I'm I'm detached. 
MATT Grab a hold. Grab anything. 
Ryan is drifting away from the Station. She sees the infinite black void ahead of her and- 
HER FOOT GETS STUCK IN THE PARACHUTE. 
It becomes tangled in the strings and fabric, slowing her down. 
Ryan is panting, her face covered in sweat. She turns back and SEES- 
Matt rolling, drifting in her direction. 
She stretches out her arm. 
Matt's arm is also outstretched. 
MATT (CONT'D) (AN EDGE) Give me... give me five here, Ryan. 
He's trying to make light of it, but he's really struggling to reach her. 
Ryan stretches farther. 
Matt's hand comes closer to hers. 
The tips of their fingers are almost touching. 
RYAN I've got you. I've got you-- 
The very tips of their fingers touch -- BUT THEY MISS. 
As Matt drifts past. 
MATT Shit... shit... 
RYAN No. No. No. Don't you. No. Don't you. Don't. Don't. NO 
As the parachute tenses, she STOPS. 
The tether attached to Matt's suit passes two feet away from her AND- 
Ryan grabs the tether. It slides through her closed fist, until- 
Her grip tightens and the tether STOPS. 
RYAN (CONT'D) Gotcha! 
Matt's momentum is now pulling Ryan, dragging her loose from the parachute. 
Orange is turning to green. Her lungs begin to absorb the oxygen and her breath becomes more even. Her body floats, relaxed in the confined space of the airlock. 
SHE FLOATS. 
Ryan brings her hands together and removes one glove. 
And then the other. 
Desperately, she begins to unscrew the lock near her waist. She squirms under the suit and pushes off the upper half. 
Then she throws off the lower half, squirming out of it as if shedding her old skin, desperate to free herself from the claustrophobia of the suit. 
Wearing only underwear and a t-shirt, she floats in mid-air, relieved and exhausted. The hum of the Space Station surrounds her. 
Then, slowly, she pulls her knees to her chest and enfolds them in her arms, floating in a fetal position. For a moment, Ryan simply hangs in suspension, a fly in amber, surrendering to the poetry of the planets, rotating slowly in the cabin's womb. 
OUTER SPACE. 500 KM ABOVE THE EARTH. 
SILENCE. 
The International Space Station, with its modules, its torn solar panels, and the Soyuz with its parachute billowing out from its center, is dwarfed against Earth's orb and the infinite universe stretching out beyond. 
The Station looks frail and secluded, lost somewhere between the grandness of the Heavens and the Earth below. 
Everything is still. 
INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. ZVEZDA MODULE. 
The module is like a wide corridor filled with cabinets, a small eating area and a small gym. A HUM reverberates across the station. 
At the end of the module there is an open circular hatch leading INTO THE- 
UNITY NODE 1. 
A spherical space with three hatches, each leading into different modules. 
A HATCH OPENS and- 
Ryan floats in. She stops at the center and holds onto a handle. 
She looks in all directions and launches to her right, towards THE- 
ZARYA MODULE. 
There are sleeping bags fastened to the walls. Clothes, shoes, a strip of three condoms -- all kinds of personal objects float in chaos around the module. 
It's clear that someone left in a hurry. 
Ryan passes a stationary bicycle and reaches for a metal cabinet on the wall. She OPENS drawers, looking for something. 
RYAN Come on, come on. 
She finds what she's looking for: a BAG OF WATER with a straw at one end. She unscrews the top and begins to drink from it. 
She DRINKS in long gulps, squeezing the bottle, trying to quench her thirst. DROPS FLOAT out of her mouth as the water overflows. They float around her face like perfect pearls of different sizes. 
She takes a pause from drinking to catch her breath. The water is cooling her down, but she still takes another long, thirsty gulp and empties the bag. 
She checks the count on the STOPWATCH- 14 minutes and counting down. 
She takes a new bag of water from the drawer, and pushing herself off of a wall, she dives into the- 
UNITY NODE 2- 
RYAN (CONT'D) OK. Where are you? Where are you? Comms. Comms... There you are! 
Without stopping, she goes through one of the open hatches into THE- 
ZVEZDA MODULE. 
The walls are filled with electrical equipment and wires. Without slowing down her momentum, she floats to the- 
MAIN CONSOLE- A large deck which houses all of the communication and navigational systems. 
On the opposite wall there is a LARGE PORTHOLE through which Earth is clearly seen. 
She begins to PUSH BUTTONS. 
COMPUTERS COME TO LIFE and Ryan puts on a communications headset. 
STATIC CRACKLES. 
RYAN Matt. This is Ryan. Copy? She waits. 
SPRAYS the extinguisher at the fire. But the extinguisher is no match for the fire, which has gathered in a gigantic smooth blue ball and is expanding, coming at her. 
Ryan makes a fast turn and launches herself in the opposite direction into the- 
UNITY NODE- 
Dashing straight into the- 
ZARYA MODULE- 
She darts across the module, behind her- 
The expanding fire ball has swallowed the Unity Node and is making its way towards her, chasing her into the- 
UNITY NODE 2- Where she makes a quick turn and darts down into the- 
DOCKING MODULE- 
Just in time. Above her, the flames cross the Node as they spread into the rest of the Station. 
They quickly spread downward, into the Docking Module. 
Ryan, the flames caressing her feet, dives through a hatch into THE- 
SOYUZ. AIRLOCK. 
Ryan crashes against a Space Suit floating inside and turns to close the hatch. 
THE FIRE is spreading outside in the module, sucking the oxygen out of the Soyuz. An incandescent blue bubble that charges at her. 
Ryan, faster than fire, CLOSES THE HATCH. 
THE SOYUZ IS SEALED OFF. 
She closes a second hatch, and the Soyuz is safe. 
She exhales in RELIEF. 
A RUMBLE in the Station makes the Soyuz quake. 
The extinguisher is blocking her path to the hatch and Ryan has to push it into the cabin as she darts toward the- 
SOYUZ. CONTROL CABIN. 
As soon as she makes it through the hatch, she TURNS the CABIN LIGHTS ON. 
There is just enough space for three astronauts to sit surrounded by the CONTROL PANEL that navigates the vessel. 
She sits down in the command chair. 
She fastens the safety belt, and looks around, trying to recognize the different buttons on the panel, which are all labeled in Russian. 
RYAN OK... where was it?... where was it? She moves her finger across the different buttons, searching. 
RYAN (CONT'D) Where is the power?... Here you are. 
Her finger stops on a button, which is labeled- BKN 
She presses on it and the CONTROL PANEL turns ON. All the buttons light up and with a hum, the Soyuz's systems start to run. 
RYAN (CONT'D) Good... good... just like training... 
Ryan reaches to the right, where next to the panel, there are several binders, each a different color. 
RYAN (CONT'D) Undocking... undocking... Yes... red... 
And she takes out a RED BINDER. 
It's all written in Cyrillic. She turns the pages until she sees a GRAPHIC representing the UNDOCKING PROCEDURE. 
RYAN (CONT'D) Ok... Ok... I remember this... undocking... 
She uses the CURSORS on the panel and selects a function on the COMPUTER SCREEN. 
She presses another button and- 
On the SCREEN, a COUNTDOWN- 4:30... 4:29... 4:28... 
Another RUMBLE in the Station. 
RYAN (CONT'D) We don't have four minutes to spare. We're going manual... 
She flips through the binder to another page. She looks at a diagram and uses the cursors on the panel to change the function on the screen- 
SHE'S SHAKEN BY A NEW PULL. 
OUTER SPACE. 500 KM ABOVE THE EARTH. 
The Soyuz stabilizes over the Station, the parachute entwined with the solar panel. 
SOYUZ. CONTROL CABIN. 
She looks out at- 
THE PORTHOLE- 
The rope extends from the cabin to the parachute tangled with the Station. 
RYAN Great. Fantastic. Perfect. 
OUTER SPACE. 500 KM ABOVE THE EARTH. 
SILENCE 
The Station hovers below the Soyuz like a large whale swimming beneath a tiny lifeboat. 
The HATCH of the Soyuz OPENS. 
Ryan comes out of the craft into space. She's wearing the space suit she packed and she carries a large bag. 
She holds onto handles as she floats, SAFELY TETHERED to the inside of the cabin. 
She LOOKS around- 
The International Space Station is a looming presence floating ten meters below. It is pulling the Soyuz by its parachute. 
An ALARM on her STOPWATCH RINGS. It's been 85 MINUTES. 
She turns the alarm off and looks around. 
RYAN Clear skies but with a chance of satellite debris. SHE HUMS A SONG, the tune is reminiscent of the Hank Williams Melody that Matt had played earlier. 
She begins to climb around the vessel. With plenty of oxygen in her pressurized suit, this is not a difficult task. 
She pulls herself from handle to handle, making her way around the Soyuz and reaching- 
THE PARACHUTE CONTAINER- 
An impact has blown open the cover. Three ropes float out of the container into space. Three meters away from the vessel each rope branches into dozens of parachute strings. Next to it- 
A second cover is also badly damaged. 
Harnessing herself to a handle, she inspects the ropes. The three ropes are bolted to the container's frame. 
RYAN (CONT'D) Okay. We detach this and we go home. Piece of cake. 
She harnesses the bag and RESUMES her HUMMING, louder this time. 
She unzips the bag and takes out the PISTOL GRIP tool, without noticing that behind her- 
DOZENS OF PIECES OF DEBRIS pass, zooming less than thirty meters away from the Station. 
A tiny piece of high-speed debris crashes against one of the Station's Solar panels, shattering it and causing the Station to tremble. 
She places the tool against the FIRST BOLT, stretching her arm into the parachute container. It is an awkward position. 
She pulls the trigger and the drill rotates, turning the bolt, but it slides out of the notch. 
She places the tool once more against the bolt and pulls the trigger. The drill rotates, SLOWER this time. 
She HUMS under her breath and SWEAT begins to drop down her forehead. 
She is very focused, unaware that behind her- 
DEBRIS HITS THE STATION'S SOLAR PANEL, piercing holes through it. 
THE BOLT COMES OFF. As it FLOATS OFF into space, Ryan drops the PISTOL GRIP and uses both hands to detach the rope from the frame. 
The ROPE FLOATS away from the Soyuz, undulating like a long snake, but- 
Ryan notices that the Pistol Grip is also floating away. 
She stretches her arm trying to catch it, but it is out of her reach. 
She pushes herself towards the pistol grip, and barely manages to grab onto it when she sees- 
RYAN (CONT'D) Oh shit. 
She takes the JOYSTICK. 
Ryan looks focused at- 
THE PERISCOPE- 
Where the western horizon comes into frame and nears the center crosshair. 
A small dot GLIMMERS in the distance- THE CHINESE STATION. 
RYAN (CONT'D) Ok. Let's visit the Chinese station. Houston in the blind, Tiangong is approximately 100km... to the west and I am off it's course by about 3 degrees. I will correct trajectory. 
She moves the Joystick, and the crosshair readjusts. 
RYAN (CONT'D) Ok. She releases the safety lock and places her finger on the button. 
RYAN (CONT'D) Ok. I'll engage main thrust in five... four... three 
She releases the safety lock. 
RYAN (CONT'D) two... one... 
She pushes on the button. 
OUTER SPACE. 300 KM ABOVE EARTH. 
The Soyuz floats with its nose directed towards a bright star on the horizon, the Chinese Station, but- 
Nothing, not even a small flame, comes out of its back thrusters. 
CONTROL CABIN. 
Ryan waits, expectantly, and gives the button a NEW PUSH, but- 
RYAN One... 
Nothing. The thruster won't ignite. 
RYAN (CONT'D) One... one... 
OUTER SPACE. 300 KM ABOVE EARTH. 
The vessel remains motionless, orbiting over the Pacific which is already under night's dark veil. 
CONTROL CABIN. 
She pushes again, and again, and again- 
RYAN Come on. Come on! 
OUTER SPACE. 300 KM ABOVE EARTH. 
But NOTHING. The Soyuz stays in place. 
CONTROL CABIN. 
Ryan looks at the FUEL GAUGE- 30 percent. 
She taps on it and the frozen needle drops to EMPTY. 
RYAN You gotta be kidding me. 
She taps on the frozen dial once more, as if trying to get the needle to go back up, and once again- 
RYAN (CONT'D) Where's your backup? 
She taps even harder this time. 
RYAN (CONT'D) Where's your goddamn backup?! 
She bangs down on the control panel in frustration-- 
RYAN (CONT'D) FU-- 
OUTER SPACE. 300 KM ABOVE EARTH. 
Inside the capsule, through the portal, Ryan hits and hits, bouncing around the confined space of the cabin and venting all her anger, until she herself is out of fuel. 
She grabs the radio and- 
RYAN This is Dr Ryan Stone, can you hear me? Houston, this is Ryan Stone, can you hear me? Copy? Houston, this is Ryan Stone, can you hear me? Copy? 
THE SUN SETS. 
RYAN (CONT'D) Where are you, Aningang? Is the sun out? Are there birds? Are there trees? Can you smell the ocean? 
TRANSMISSION Ieukpalliktuq naabuqtuq. 
RYAN Is it beautiful where you are? Here it's colder than hell and lonelier than shit, but it's beautiful Aningang. Utterly, terrifyingly beautiful. 
Through THE PORTHOLE- Even under the darkness of night, it is possible to see the glaciers spreading over the green forests. It all looks so fresh and full of life. 
RYAN (CONT'D) Make your dogs bark again, Aningang. Will you? Please... 
TRANSMISSION Suli aasrivak aatqatik niuruq...? 
RYAN Dogs! Woof. Woof. Woof. 
She makes barking noises. The man begins to laugh and barks back at her. 
TRANSMISSION Auuu. Auuu. Oipmiq. Oipmiq! Auuu. Auuu. 
Ryan and Aningang bark in unison. 
RYAN Woof. Woof. 
TRANSMISSION Auuu... Auuu... 
RYAN AND TRANSMISSION Auuu. Auuu. Woof. Woof. 
Ryan begins to HOWL, giving in to the mad joy of it all. Moments later, through the RADIO, she is joined by a CHORUS of CANINES--Aningang's DOGS--TUNING INTO HER VOICE in a mad, crazy harmonic cacophony. Ryan smiles, blissfully happy, howling with abandon. 
Each howling reaches deeper and is more cathartic, unlocking emotions that have been festering over time, and- 
TEARS ROLL FROM HER EYES, clear as crystals, spilling from her lashes and floating INTO THE AIR, glimmering LIKE SAPPHIRES in the cool moonlight. 
They float away, like tiny satellites orbiting her face. 
Aningang can be heard intermittently, YELLING, as if trying to silence the dogs. Then the dogs, one by one, cease their wailing and Ryan is left with nothing but her own voice. 
She stops, gazing at her tears suspended in the gloomy blue light. RYAN I'm going to die, Aningang. 
The SIGNAL ebbs, losing its battle with the STATIC. 
RYAN (CONT'D) I mean, we're all going to die. Everyone knows that. But I'm going to die today... 
The STATIC waffles in and out. 
RYAN (CONT'D) Funny that. To know. 
The STATIC breaks and Aningang's HUSKY VOICE begins SINGING. 
RYAN (CONT'D) And you know what Aningang... I don't care. I don't care if I die. I don't have anything... not anymore. 
Ryan is floating now over her seat. 
RYAN (CONT'D) But the thing is... I'm still scared. I'm really scared... 
She rolls in space and stares upwards... 
RYAN (CONT'D) No one will mourn me. No one will pray for my soul. Will you mourn me, Aningang? Is it too late to say a prayer? I'd say one for myself, but I have never prayed in my life... no one ever taught me how... 
The tune is lyrical and soothing, tinged with a touch of melancholy. 
RYAN (CONT'D) No one ever taught me how... 
Ryan listens to Aningang's melody and smiles softly, closing her eyes. 
Ryan's face grows slack as she drifts toward unconsciousness, buoyed along on Aningang's sad soulful song. Then... 
...a SPUTTERING CRY cuts through the static. 
A BABY. Ryan's eyes pop open. 
RYAN (CONT'D) A baby. There's a baby with you. 
A beat. Aningang stops singing, speaking in a soft voice: 
TRANSMISSION Ieukpalliktuq upatimi... 
RYAN You are singing to your baby? Is that a lullaby? That's so sweet! 
Ryan is transfixed, listening to the gentle gurgle of the baby as Aningang coos to it, then begins to SING again. 
RYAN (CONT'D) I used to sing to my baby too. 
Painful memories flash before her, haunting her. Ryan's lump in her throat is washed away by a gentle sob. 
And sound re-emerges with the beeping of the alarms as- 
The red-orange-green graph on the control panel show the atmospheric levels reaching green. 
Ryan uncovers her face and stares from the shadows at the figure, who straps into the seat next to her. He unlocks the ring around his collar and- 
TAKES OFF HIS HELMET. 
COUNTRY WESTERN MUSIC escapes into the cabin. 
MATT Ahhhh! Alright, check your watch. 13 hours, 11 minutes. Call Anatoly, tell him he's been bumped. 
The figure glances around. 
MATT (CONT'D) Bit gloomy in here. How `bout a little light? 
He taps a few buttons on the console and a face blooms: 
Matt. 
Ryan stares, mouth agape. 
RYAN How did you? 
MATT Trust me, it's a hell of a story. RYAN But how did you? 
He reaches out and effortlessly flicks a myriad array of switches. Instantly, the alarms go silent. 
MATT That's better. 
RYAN How? 
Ryan looks at him wide eyed, wanting to know how- 
MATT I found a little extra battery power. I'm just happy you're still alive. To be honest, I thought your chances were slim to none. By the way, did you find the vodka? 
RYAN You never told me where. 
Matt fishes a SMALL FLASK from under his seat, spins off the cap... 
MATT Oh well... To Anatoly! Na zdorovje. 
...and takes a big gulp. He offers the flask to Ryan, who appears to be dozing off. She blinks, shakes her head. 
RYAN No. 
He studies her. 
MATT No? Right, let's get out of here. 
He looks at the monitors, where the Chinese Station is seen. 
MATT (CONT'D) We're `bout a hundred miles to the Chinese Station. A little Sunday drive. 
RYAN We can't. 
MATT Course we can. RYAN There's no fuel. I tried everything. 
MATT Well, there's always something we can do. 
RYAN I tried everything. 
MATT Did you try the soft landing jets? 
RYAN They're for landing so. 
MATT Well landing is launching it's the same thing, didn't you learn about that in training? 
RYAN I never got to land the simulator, I told you. 
MATT But you know about it. 
RYAN And I crashed it every time. 
Ryan is falling asleep. Matt studies her as she dozes off. 
MATT Listen you want to go back or do you want to stay here? I get it, it's nice up here, you can just shut down all the systems turn out all the lights, and just close your eyes and tune out everybody. 
Matt starts flipping through buttons on the console, turning the cabin lights off. 
MATT (CONT'D) There's nobody up here who can hurt you, it's safe. Then what's the point in going on, what's the point of living? 
When the cabin is in darkness, he turns and looks at Ryan. MATT (CONT'D) Your kid died, doesn't get any rougher than that, but still it's a matter of what you do now. If you decide to go that you've gotta just get on with it, sit back enjoy the ride. You have to start living life, Ryan. 
RYAN (CONT'D) Let's reset you then. 
Using the manual as a reference, Ryan uses the cursors to select the ALTITUDE DISPLAY on the computer screen. 
The current ALTITUDE is- 2600 M. 
She uses the cursors and presses a button. A WARNING on the computer screen comes on. She presses another button, and- 
ON THE SCREEN, the ALTITUDE goes blank. 
Ryan punches a new set of commands. 
The ALTITUDE now reads- 3 meters. 
RYAN (CONT'D) Okay. I only have one shot at this. One shot... 
She extends her finger... 
RYAN(CONT'D) What's the point if we don't try? 
SHE PRESSES THE BUTTON. 
OUTER SPACE. 
A THREE SECOND THRUST ignites at the back of the cabin, pushing it at great speeds toward the Chinese Station. 
SOYUZ CONTROL CABIN. 
The strength of the thrust pushes Ryan back in her seat. 
She looks at- 
THE PERISCOPE- 
The Soyuz is approaching the Tiangong. The center of the crosshair is aiming three degrees above the Chinese Station. 
OUTER SPACE. 
The Soyuz is making its way rapidly towards the Chinese Station. 
CONTROL CABIN. 
Ryan is looking out of the window, at Earth- 
RYAN Wow... you were right Matt... it's magnificent.... 
She then turns to- 
THE PERISCOPE- The Chinese Station quickly grows in size as the Soyuz gets closer and closer. 
ALTITUDE DIAL- 155 km and dropping. 
RYAN (CONT'D) You're losing altitude, Tiangong. You keep dropping and you're going to kiss the atmosphere. But not before I get to you. You have my last ride home. 
A new sense of urgency comes up on Ryan's face. 
She unhooks the umbilical from her suit. 
She unstraps herself. 
She floats over and looks out of- 
THE PORTHOLE- 
The Chinese Station is approaching, getting closer. 
She disarms the emergency exit and holds on to the LATCH. 
She pauses and turns to grab the fire extinguisher and holds it tightly against her chest with one arm. With the other arm- 
She reaches for the Latch. 
The Station is hovering right next to her and the cabin is going to pass it. 
RYAN (CONT'D) Okay, I'm done with just driving. Let's get go home. 
She turns the latch, and- 
PYROTECHNICS shoot the porthole into space. 
The brutal force of the infinite VACUUM of space SUCKS THE AIR out of the cabin, and- 
Ryan is LAUNCHED out of the cabin at a tremendous speed. 
Her outstretched arm reaching toward- 
THE STATION- 
She slowly drifts across the modules, the tips of her fingers almost touching the surface of the Tiangong. 
A handle passes under her, almost within reach, but she does not manage to hold onto it. INSIDE THE HELMET- 
She's struggling, but she knows she's not going to make it. She looks ahead at- 
THE STATION- 
A solar panel, following the rotation of the Station, comes into view. 
She stretches out her arm as she gets closer to it. 
But the solar panel continues its rotation and she is approaching very slowly. 
The panel is rotating away. 
She STRETCHES, and- 
She GRABS onto a rod on the Solar Panel, STOPPING her momentum. 
Ryan hangs from the Station. She holds her right arm tightly to her chest. 
INSIDE THE HELMET- 
She catches her breath and is clearly in pain. 
RYAN SEES- 
A LONESOME PIECE OF DEBRIS. 
It hovers above the Station and glows as the sunlight hits its surface. It passes very quickly. 
And there's ANOTHER ONE cruising farther above. 
She pulls her right arm up. 
RYAN Ahhhhhh! 
The pain is excruciating, but she grabs onto the panel's rod, AND- 
SHE PULLS HERSELF UP, and clinging with her leg, she secures herself to the panel. 
INSIDE THE HELMET- 
She's panting, and through the fogged up glass she can see, far away over the horizon- 
BRIGHT DOTS. Pieces of debris burn as they hit the atmosphere. A swarm of incandescent locusts that- 
Is coming directly at her. 
Ignoring her pain but using her right arm as little as possible, she climbs up to- 
THE BODY OF THE STATION. 
She goes over the module and makes her way across, pulling herself from handle to handle. 
When she reaches the end of it, with one last BIG PULL she makes it to the- 
HATCH that leads into the airlock. 
With her bad arm she holds onto a handle. 
With the other, she pulls on the latch and- 
OPENS THE AIRLOCK. 
A gust of AIR bursts out, pushing the hatch wide open. 
Ryan holds on tightly to the handle. 
ABOVE HER- 
Clusters of DEBRIS pass by, flying at different distances and at great speeds. 
Pieces COLLIDE with each other, exploding into more debris. 
A BIG PIECE OF DEBRIS is flying downward, missing the Station by ten meters as it continues its descent. And- 
250 meters below, it BURNS like a shooting star. 
LOOP 
She enters the hatch into the- TIANGONG LAB MODULE. 
The only light is coming from flickering emergency lights. Objects float in chaos. 
Ryan makes her way, dodging the disarray of lab objects- 
Scientific instruments: A plant drifting by with its roots exposed, clusters of liquid floating like wobbly spheres, two eggs hovering, one of which is broken. 
THE SHAKING INTENSIFIES as- 
She reaches the end of the module and goes into the- 
TIANGONG NODE 2. 
She floats to the center of the node. 
There are three open hatches- RIGHT, LEFT, and- 
BELOW- 
A Docking Module, very similar to the one in the ISS. At the far end of it an open hatch leads into the SHENZHOU ESCAPE POD. 
MORE RUMBLING SHAKES THE STATION. 
OUTER SPACE. 
A SOLAR PANEL, defeated by the friction with the atmosphere, breaks off from the Station and is thrown farther down, where it quickly burns, dissolving into sparks. 
The TIDAL WAVE of debris is catching up with the Station, a cloud of metal pieces that sparkle with the sunlight. 
BRIGHT STREAKS can be seen as debris burns, scratching through the atmosphere. 
TIANGONG NODE 2. 
Ryan springs into the- 
DOCKING MODULE. 
Floating through it and reaching the open hatch at the other end, she tosses the helmet inside the Shenzhou. 
A LOUD METALLIC ROAR. The Station is collapsing. She dives through the hatch into the- SHENZHOU ESCAPE POD. AIRLOCK. 
It is almost identical to the Soyuz's airlock. 
She does a quick flip and- 
CLOSES the outer hatch. 
Then she pulls on another latch and- 
CLOSES the inner hatch. 
The Shenzhou is SEALED OFF from the rest of the Station. 
She throws the helmet into the Control Cabin and follows through, into the- 
SHENZHOU ESCAPE POD. CONTROL CABIN. 
She struggles to turn around in the confined space, and then- 
She pulls the hatch CLOSED. 
THE CONTROL CABIN IS SEALED. 
The Shenzhou is smaller than the Soyuz and has only one seat. In this confined space, the SHAKING of the station is felt even stronger. 
She sits, BUCKLES herself in, and looks at the- 
CONTROL PANEL. 
It has more monitors than the Soyuz's panel, and the main board is arranged differently. All of the buttons are labeled with CHINESE IDEOGRAMS. 
AND IT IS SHAKING FIERCELY. 
RYAN Seriously? 
THROUGH- 
THE PORTHOLE- 
A thin bright yellow halo covers the whole window. 
As the cabin RATTLES VIOLENTLY. 
RYAN (CONT'D) Because either way-- 
She closes her eyes, puts her finger over the button. 
RYAN (CONT'D) It'll be one hell of a ride. 
Ryan presses the button. 
RYAN (CONT'D) I'm ready. 
OUTER SPACE. 
The Station is bouncing over the atmosphere. One end of it is glowing more brightly and catches FIRE. 
The TIDE OF DEBRIS is getting closer. Not far off some pieces are already burning. 
A LARGE PIECE OF DEBRIS has caught on fire and is flying at great speed and- 
COLLIDES WITH THE STATION, Tearing it into two parts, which are sent twisting in opposite directions. The ESCAPE POD, attached to the DOCK, is spinning towards earth. 
SHENZHOU ESCAPE POD. 
Ryan is SHAKEN and RATTLED in her seat. 
RYAN Yeehaaa! 
GRAVITY is still minimal, but the force of the inertia is rough and it jerks her around. She sees- 
A RED LEVER above her, but she can only reach it with her bad hand. 
SHE STRETCHES 
RYAN (CONT'D) Ahhhhhhhh! 
SHE GRABS THE LEVER- 
AND PULLS IT. 
OUTER SPACE. 
THE LOCKS DISENGAGE- 
THE CABIN separates from the rest of the vessel and from the Station. It spins away, plummeting toward the atmosphere. 
The two fragments of the Tiangong follow, spinning in a rage of sparks and fire. 
SHENZHOU ESCAPE POD. 
The spinning is punishing. Ryan is shaken violently. She is also mumbling words to herself that we can't hear. It looks like she rambling. 
Some LIGHTS GO OFF. 
ATMOSPHERE. 130 KM ABOVE THE EARTH. 
The capsule's aerodynamics slow down the spinning, positioning the vessel nose up. 
It cuts through the atmosphere at incredible speeds. Its metal is burning hot. 
Smoldering DEBRIS and the fragments of the STATION chase the Shenzhou in its descent. 
SHENZHOU ESCAPE POD. 
THE PORTHOLE- 
A blinding light pours in from outside the window. 
The spinning is over, but the cabin vibrates with a loud rumble. 
As the G-Force restrains Ryan against her seat, she clenches her face and sweats. 
On the ceiling, condensation begins to form. 
ATMOSPHERE. 120 KM ABOVE THE EARTH. 
The Shenzhou is a ball of fire precipitating from the skies. 
It's followed very closely by DEBRIS and the two fragments of the STATION. 
The TWO FRAGMENTS COLLIDE and EXPLODE into a ball of fire that breaks into many pieces. 
An avalanche of fire cascades towards the Shenzhou, rapidly closing the distance. 
She UNSTRAPS herself and- 
Reaches a LEVER at the side of the hatch. 
She PULLS THE LEVER. ON THE LAKE. 
With a small controlled explosion, the hatch cover is launched away from the cabin. 
Smoke pours out through the open hatch. 
SHENZHOU ESCAPE POD. 
She begins to unstrap herself when- 
WATER POURS IN through the open hatch. 
She tries to make her way out, fighting against the strong current that is gushing in, but the flow is too strong and- 
IT PUSHES HER BACK IN. 
She struggles to force her way through the cascade rapidly filling the cabin, but it is too strong. 
THE CABIN IS OVERFLOWING. 
The water has reached Ryan's chin when- 
She manages to take ONE LAST DEEP BREATH of air before- 
WATER COMPLETELY FILLS IT. 
UNDERWATER 
The metallic capsule, which weighs almost three tons, sinks quickly into the lake. As the ropes of the parachute tense, the long fabric follows the cabin down. 
SHENZHOU ESCAPE POD. 
Air trapped inside Ryan's suit leaks out through the collar and small bubbles float up. 
Ryan fights her way to the hatch, and pulling with her good arm, she swims out. 
UNDERWATER. 
She pushes herself away from the cabin, swimming away from the POD AS- 
THE SHENZHOU HITS THE LAKE BOTTOM. A dark cloud of mud swells up around it. 
Ryan struggles to SWIM UP to the surface, but she can only use one arm and the wet suit is DRAGGING HER DOWN. 
She strokes rapidly, but she isn't moving up. Instead- 
SHE'S GOING DOWN, and 
HER FEET SINK INTO THE LAKE BED. 
She looks up and sees- 
The rays of sunlight breaking through the lake's surface are eclipsed by the parachute, which floats down toward her like a huge jellyfish about to engulf its pray. 
THE FROG crosses in front of her, effortlessly swimming on its way to the surface. 
Small bubbles of air come out of Ryan's nose as she struggles to open her suit. 
She takes off the BOTTOM PART of the suit. 
ABOVE HER- 
THE PARACHUTE IS GETTING CLOSER, a net about to trap her. 
She struggles out of the TOP PART of her suit. And squirming out from under it- 
She frees herself from the heavy garments and SWIMS UP as- 
THE SINKING PARACHUTE traps her foot and begins dragging her down. But with a kick- 
SHE SETS HERSELF FREE, and- 
SHE SWIMS UP, stroking with her good arm. She is completely out of breath, only the tiniest bubbles rise from her nose. 
She is about to lose consciousness, when she sees- 
THE FROG swimming ahead of her, sliding smoothly through the water toward the rays of sunlight diffracted by the surface. 
Ryan's eyes are closed as she floats up, her body limp. The surface is coming closer and closer.

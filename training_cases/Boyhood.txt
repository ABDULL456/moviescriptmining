Richard Linklater 
EXT.   OUTSIDE SCHOOL - DAY 
MASON waits outside his elementary school, laying in the grass staring up at the clouds. In the distance, the school door opens and Mason's MOM, Olivia, walks toward him. 
MOM Hey, love bug. You ready? 
He is quickly on his feet and they are walking toward the car. 
MASON Yeah.     Hey, guess what, Mom? 
MOM What? 
MASON I figured out where wasps come from. 
MOM Oh, yeah?    Where? 
MASON Well, I think it must be if you flick a rock into the air just right, it'll turn into a wasp. 
MOM Dang... 
MASON Yep. 
MOM That's cool. 
INT. CAR - DAY 
Driving... 
MOM So how was your day at school? 
MASON Fine. 
MOM Hey, I had a good meeting with Miss Butler this time. I kinda liked her. 
MASON What did she say? 
MOM Well... she said that you weren't turning in your homework assignments. And I told her, "I know he does them, 'cause I check them every night." She said she found a big chunk of them crumpled up at the bottom of your backpack. 
MASON She didn't ask for 'em. 
MOM Well, baby, she doesn't have to. You're supposed to turn them in. And she said you're still staring out the window all day. 
MASON Not all day. 
MOM And she said that you destroyed her pencil sharpener. 
MASON Not on purpose. 
MOM Wait, she said that you crammed a bunch of rocks in it. 
MASON I thought if it could sharpen pencils, maybe we could sharpen rocks. 
MOM (stifling laugh) Well, what were you gonna do with a bunch of sharpened rocks? 
MASON I was trying to make arrowheads for my rock collection. 
MOM Hm. 
She glances back at him, with an understanding sigh. 
EXT. HOUSE/DITCH - DAY 
Mason rides his bike across the front yard and heads down the street. Soon he and his friend TOMMY are riding down the embankment of a large drainage ditch. 
EXT. DITCH - DAY 
Mason runs up, as Tommy is spray-painting a drawing on the concrete wall of the drainage ditch. 
MASON Dude, when's my turn? 
TOMMY I don't know. 
Tommy hands Mason the can of spray paint.     Mason begins to spray-paint a letter on the wall. 
SAMANTHA (O.S.) (calling out) ...Maaason. 
TOMMY Samantha! 
SAMANTHA Oh!    Tommy!    Is Mason down there? 
TOMMY Yeah. 
SAMANTHA Well, tell him he has to come home for dinner. 
TOMMY   (O.S.) Okay. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Mason lays on the floor watching a cartoon. 
There's a knock at the door, and Mom comes out to answer it. It's TED. 
MOM Hey. 
TED Hey, sweetie. Why aren't you ready? Hey, Mason. 
MASON Hey, Ted. 
TED Come on, come on, hurry up.      Let's go. 
MOM What time is it? 
TED It's nine.     Let's go, let's go. 
MOM Okay, I meant to call you, 'cause Janice flaked out. I don't have a sitter. 
TED Why didn't you call somebody else? 
MOM Well, I can't get a baby-sitter now, it's nine o'clock. But you're welcome to hang out with us. 
TED Well, no. I mean we have plans. The guys are expecting me. 
MOM Well... you can go. 
TED (O.S.) All right. Yeah, well, I'll come back in a couple of hours. Is that okay? 
MOM Yeah.   Yes. 
TED All right. 
MOM It's okay. 
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT 
The kids lie on either side of Mom, as she reads a story aloud to them. 
MOM (Reading) "Turn back! Turn back! I don't wanna talk to Moaning Myrtle." "Who?" said Harry as they backtracked quickly. "She haunts one of the toilets in the girls bathroom on the first floor," said Hermione. "She haunts a toilet?" (MORE) 
MOM Samantha, I have to go back to college so I can make us a better living. 
Smack. 
MOM (O.S.) (CONT'D) With this job I can't take care of us the way I'd like to. I can't keep going this way. And Grandma said she'd help us out... and it would be nice to be near her. 
SAMANTHA Fine, Mother. You can do whatever you want but (shrugs) We're not moving. (Smacks) 
Mason moves his fork around in his bowl. 
MASON What about our friends? 
MOM Oh, baby, we can e-mail them or write. We can come back to visit. And guess what? 
She reaches out to touch Samantha's arm. 
MOM (CONT'D) This place that Grandma found us, you'll each have your own room. Right? 
Samantha shrugs. 
MOM (CONT'D) And there's a pool. 
Samantha shrugs again, clearly not sold on the idea. 
INT.   BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Mason and Mom are lying on his bed together. 
MASON Mom, do you still love Dad? 
MOM I still love your father... but that doesn't mean it was healthy for us to stay together. 
MASON What if after we move he's trying to find us and he can't? 
MOM Oh, that won't be a problem. He can call Grandma and she'll tell him or he can call Information. We won't be hard to find. 
She pushes back his hair lovingly. 
MASON Is he still in Alaska? 
MOM Well, that's what your uncle says. 
MASON Probably taming polar bears or something. 
MOM Yeah... well, I hope they're taming him. 
EXT. HOUSE - DAY 
The moving van drives off as mom puts another item in the pile of stuff to be left at the curb. 
INT. HOUSE - DAY 
Mom and Mason are getting ready to paint in the empty bedroom. They're looking at the two lone murals, which look a little odd without the bunk bed in front of them. 
MOM Here, wanna help me out? 
MASON Sure. 
MOM Okay. Take this paint... very carefully... and paint any little smudge or mark or anything on the baseboard there, behind the door, and all around the doorways on the inside. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Meanwhile, Samantha is talking on the phone. 
SAMANTHA (on phone) She says we're gonna come visit and I'm gonna write and call you. Oh, wait, hold on a second. I'm getting another call. (Pushes Flash) Hello? Sorry, Tommy, Mason can't come over today. We're moving. And I'm on the other line. Bye. (Pushes Button) Althea? I'm gonna be sending Sailor Scout instructions. Email, and write back telling me how the other scouts are doing. Well, because you're the leader now. 
During the last bit of this conversation, Mason slowly paints over the "growth chart" lines on the bedroom door jamb. 
EXT. OUTSIDE FRONT DOOR - DAY 
Carrying their final belongings from inside the house, they slowly exit the front door and head over to the car. 
MOM Okay, let's go, 'cause I wanna get there before it gets dark. 
SAMANTHA Goodbye yard, goodbye crepe myrtle, goodbye mailbox. Goodbye box of stuff Mommy won't let us take with us but we don't wanna throw away. Goodbye house, I'll never like mommy as much for making us move. 
MOM Samantha! Why don't you say goodbye to that little horse shit attitude? Okay? 'Cause we're not taking that in the car. 
Just before he gets in the car, Mason is looking out at the neighborhood. 
MASON Goodbye old lady who listens to rock music and rides a motorcycle. 
Soon the car is pulling away. As they drive off, Mason notices out his side of the car, Tommy approaching on a bike in the distance, gesturing toward the car. Mason watches him out the window, but says nothing as Tommy recedes into the distance. 
INT. CAR - DAY 
Mason and Samantha are restless     and energetic, letting their childish energy get the best of     them as they wrestle, hit, and squeal at each other in the     back seat of the car. It is all well-intentioned though, as     the two share a laugh after Mom tells them to quiet down. 
SAMANTHA Eeeee!   Don't! 
MOM Hey! Hey, what's happening back there? Stop, put the barrier up. 
SAMANTHA Ahh!   Stop!    No! 
Mason punches the pillow barrier between himself and Samantha, while his Mom speaks. 
MOM Hey, put the pillow between you. Make a barrier, come on. Stop. We're gonna play a game called The Game of Silence. Whoever can stay quiet for the longest period of time wins. You guys think you can do that? Okay, go! 
The family's car moves on toward the Houston skyline just as dusk arrives. 
INT. BEDROOM - DAY 
Mason appears grumpy, trying to shove what he needs for the day into his backpack quickly. 
MOM (O.S.) The bus'll be here in ten minutes. 
MOM (CONT'D) (steps into doorway) Put that homework in your backpack! 
MOM (O.S.) (CONT'D) Go eat!    Baby, go eat! 
MASON I am! 
INT. KITCHEN - DAY 
Samantha places pancakes on their plates while talking to Mason in a cryptic language, reminiscent of pig latin. 
SAMANTHA ...I affatay servay yoohay. 
MASON Speak English! Shut up. Mom! She's speaking that stupid language again! 
MOM Samantha! 
SAMANTHA I was speaking perfectly clear English, Mother. You know, he's a little slow in the head. He did officially flunk first grade. 
MOM Sit your butt down. 
SAMANTHA Yes sir, Mother sir! 
She salutes. 
MOM All right, listen up guys. Grandma's gonna pick you up after school. Your dad is in town for the day so you're gonna spend the afternoon with him. 
SAMANTHA Hmm. 
GRANDMA You got backpacks, your purse. Homework. Go to the bathroom. 
DAD Can't believe how big they are. 
GRANDMA Yeah.    Time is goin' by. 
DAD Mm. Must be nice for you, having 'em here in Houston. 
GRANDMA I love it, yeah. I'm volunteering at their school. 
DAD Oh yeah?   What you doin' over there? 
GRANDMA I'm in the library.         You know, reading to the little ones. 
DAD Huh.    Great. 
GRANDMA So -- Alaska, huh? 
DAD Yeah. 
GRANDMA Are you back? 
DAD We'll see.   How's Liv? 
GRANDMA She's a busy girl. Yeah. She's back in school. But she's working, and single parenting... a lot to juggle. 
DAD You guys got everything, huh? 
MASON AND SAMANTHA Yeah. 
DAD Alright, say goodbye to your grandmother. 
MASON (O.S.) Bye! 
SAMANTHA   (O.S.) Bye grandma! 
DAD Alright, let's roll. Now wait a second. You're not the type of kids who like presents, are ya? 
SAMANTHA Yes! 
DAD Naw, you don't -- 
MASON Yeah! 
SAMANTHA 'Course we are! 
DAD Really?   Let's do it! 
MASON AND SAMANTHA Yeah!   Yay! 
MASON I call front seat! 
SAMANTHA I wanted the front seat, though. 
DAD Alright. Well, Mason gets it on the way there and Samantha gets it on the way back, huh? Hop in there. 
GRANDMA     (O.S.) Seat belts! 
DAD Seat belts.     Alright. 
He motions to Grandma that he's got it covered. 
DAD (CONT'D) Seat belts. Not like this car has any seat belts. 
INT.   BOWLING ALLEY - LATER 
Samantha is bowling, her pink ball hurdling down the lane toward the pins. 
DAD (O.S.) Nice...   Nice... Nice... 
Strike! 
SAMANTHA Yay! 
DAD Yeah!    Alright! 
Dad is clearly impressed and excited for Samantha, as he stands to embrace her. 
DAD (CONT'D) Come here, come here, yes! That was awesome! Get up there Mason, get up there! 
SAMANTHA Daddy! 
DAD (to Samantha) It was so good! (to Mason) Come on. Let 'em know who you are, buddy. Let 'em know who you are. 
Dad kisses Samantha.      Mason throws his bowling ball. 
DAD (CONT'D) Yes!    Yes!   Yes! Alright, alright... 
Gutter ball. 
DAD (CONT'D) Don't worry about it. 
MASON Wish we could use the bumpers. 
DAD Bumpers are for kids. You know, what're you, two years old? You don't want the bumpers. Life doesn't give you bumpers. 
Mason tosses the ball again. 
DAD (CONT'D) There we, there we go, there we go! We got something there! We got something! We got something! Ooooh! 
Another gutter ball. 
MASON Last time I went bowling we had bumpers and it was a lot more fun! 
Dad gets up to bowl. 
DAD You don't want the bumpers, alright? You bowl a strike with the bumpers and it doesn't mean anything. Trust me. Just lay it out on the lane. One, two, three and... 
Samantha mimes smoking, points to Dad, as if to say that he smells of cigarettes. It's Dad's turn to bowl. 
DAD (CONT'D) Ka-blam! Let's hear it for the father! Whoo! (To Samantha) Get up there, get in there... 
SAMANTHA Yay!   Great job! 
DAD Get out there, girl, get out there! 
Score-keeping screen flashes an animated alligator that reads: STRIKE 
EXT. Street as car burns (on TV screen) 
TV NEWSMAN (V.O.) Four Blackwater operatives have been viciously attacked in their cars in (MORE) 
TV NEWSMAN (V.O.) (CONT'D) Fallujah. The bodies and cars were set on fire, after insurgents started shooting, killing American citizens. 
DAD (O.S.) Look at this. It's a disaster. 
TV NEWSMAN (V.O.) But the ambush didn't end there. The bodies of the four men were savagely ripped apart... 
INT. BOWLING ALLEY CAFE - EVENING 
The family sits around a table enjoying their snacks, while Dad smokes a cigarette. 
DAD (O.S.) Alright, let me tell you what's happening in Iraq, alright? Exactly what every thinking person in the world knew was gonna happen before they got started. Bush and his little numb-nut fanatics he's got around him, they don't give a rat's ass. 
BILL (to Mindy) Did he work on it at all, Mindy? 
MINDY No. 
BILL (to Mindy) Did he sit around playing video games with Mason the whole time?

NEIGHBORHOOD GIRL She's always walking in the locker room. 
RANDY I think I still have a couple of those-- 
PAUL, overly large/mentally impaired neighborhood teen they seem familiar with, walks by awkwardly bouncing a basketball. 
NEIGHBORHOOD BOY (O.S.) Hey, Paul.     Tell us a joke.

The kids look at him quizzically and keep walking.

SAMANTHA Sure.

Your mother's got a new husband now, He seems alright, I wonder if he's readin' them stories, And kissin' them goodnight? Well babysitters say they miss me, I know I shouldn't hope it's true, The teacher says my son paints pictures of a family all in blue, She says she caught him whispering to the window, Will Daddy please come home?

DAD What do you mean? 
MASON You know, like elves and stuff. People just made that up. 
DAD Well, I don't know. I mean what makes you thinks that, that elves are any more magical than something like... like a whale? (MORE) 
DAD (CONT'D) You know, I mean, what if I told you a story about how underneath the ocean, there was this giant sea mammal that used sonar, and sang songs, and it was so big that its heart was the size of a car? And you could crawl through the arteries? I mean, you'd think that's pretty magical, right?

MOM No -- Go in the house! Go! Go in the house! Go in the house! 
BILL Your mother had a little accident. Now she's being dramatic.

BILL (CONT'D) Get off the fucking floor Olivia, for Christ's sake! 
Mom continues to cry. 
INT.   DINING AREA - MOMENTS LATER

The family is seated at the dinner table, practically frozen. 
SAMANTHA No. 
BILL Mindy? 
MINDY No. 
BILL I didn't think so. 
He drinks the entire glass, and slowly zeros in on Mason. 
BILL (CONT'D) You don't like me much, do you Mason? That's okay, I don't like me either. Think that's funny, huh? You think that's fuckin' funny? 
Bill throws his empty glass at Mason's plate, shattering it. 
MOM Oh!

MINDY It's still not working. 
SAMANTHA Well, what's gonna happen to them? What happens when their legal guardian is dangerous and abusive? 
MOM You know, I don't know honey. I called their mom. I called the Child Protective Services. You know, I have you and your brother. We were in a dangerous situation. You're my responsibility. 
SAMANTHA Are we ever gonna see them again?

CAROL Okay. 
EXT.   SCHOOL - DAY 
Mom pulls up to drop Samantha off at the front doors of her new Junior High School. 
SAMANTHA Mom, this is awful. You're dumping me in some parking lot of this school where I don't even know anyone! I'm leaving all my friends and I didn't even get to say goodbye! I don't know where to go! 
MOM Okay, Samantha. You go right through that door. The office is right there. They're expecting you, they're gonna give you your schedule. Here's your lunch money. I will pick you up right here at 3:30. 
SAMANTHA I'm wearing dirty clothes! Because you wouldn't even let us get our stuff! We don't even have a place to live! This sucks! 
Samantha gets out of the car, slamming the door behind her. Mom screams out of the window as she walks away. 
MOM Samantha... I'm doing the best I can! And you're right, it sucks! But it doesn't suck half as much as having a drunk fool slam your head against a wall! So cut your horseshit attitude. 
Mom turns to Mason in the back as he climbs toward the front seat. 
MOM (CONT'D) Put your seat belt on! 
INT.   SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

Mom leans in to kiss him. 
MASON Mom... 
Mason walks away, embarrassed at her public affection.

MRS. DARBY Kenny. This is Mason and I want you to show him around today, okay? 
KENNY Got it.

Mason pushes an Obama/Biden campaign sign into the ground, before he and Samantha walk across the street. Samantha waits in the street with more signs, while Mason knocks on the RESIDENT's front door. 
RESIDENT   (O.S.) What? 
The white-haired Resident is standing to Mason's right, beneath his carport. 
MASON Oh, hi. Can I put an Obama sign in your yard? 
RESIDENT Do I look like a Barack Hussein Obama supporter? 
Mason shrugs. 
RESIDENT (CONT'D) No. 
Mason turns to leave. 
RESIDENT (CONT'D) This is private property. Get off. I could shoot you! 
He rejoins Samantha at the street. 
MASON What a dick. 
SAMANTHA He had a Confederate flag on his house. 
EXT.   NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - MOMENTS LATER 
Samantha is now talking to a young, BLONDE HOUSEWIFE. 
BLONDE HOUSEWIFE I love it! (MORE) 
BLONDE HOUSEWIFE (CONT'D) Young Obama supporters out on the trail. This is great! Are you doing this through your school? 
SAMANTHA Um.   Our dad's a big supporter. 
BLONDE HOUSEWIFE Oh, that's great. I mean, we've just got to pull together to get this win, right? 
SAMANTHA Yeah. 
BLONDE HOUSEWIFE Oh, I just love him so much. I mean I have these dreams where I'm just kissing him because I just love him so much! He's so cute, isn't he? 
SAMANTHA (laughs) Yeah. 
BLONDE HOUSEWIFE Do you know, I made these t-shirts for my kids. "My Momma's for Obama!" Do you like it? It's good, right? Yeah. 
Samantha turns to walk towards the street. 
DAD And this is Mason Junior right here. Tammy. 
TAMMY      (O.S.) Mason Junior. 
DAD   (O.S.) Say hi. 
MASON Hi. 
TAMMY Hi, Mason. Nice to meet you.      Heard a lot about you guys. 
DAD Yeah, yeah.     What're you doin' here? You uh... 
TAMMY Oh, I'm just here with some friends. 
DAD Oh, well, uh.... 
TAMMY Yeah.     What are you guys up to? 
Dad sits back down at the table. 
DAD Um, we're going camping. Well no, this one is not going camping. This one is going to a party. 
TAMMY (to Samantha) Ohh... Fun. 
DAD We, the men, are going camping. 
TAMMY Boys are going camping. Alright, very nice. Well uh, we still on for tomorrow or...? 
DAD   (O.S.) Yeah -- 
TAMMY Yeah? 
DAD Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I'll drop him off at seven and then I'll just call you, alright? 
TAMMY Okay. Great. It was really nice meeting you both. Take care. 
DAD I'll see you. 
TAMMY Talk to you soon. Bye. 
Tammy walks away. Mason smirks at his dad. 
DAD Don't -- don't, don't look at me like that, alright? I just -- look, just to finish the point -- okay? I was twenty-three when your mom had you, alright? So was she, alright? And we didn't put ourselves in the best position to be great parents, and I wish that -- I wish I were a better parent to you guys. Alright? And I, I hope that you can learn from my mistakes. Okay? So, wear a condom. Or get Garrett to -- I don't know. Whatever. 
Samantha cringes, as Dad laughs. Mason can't help but smile. 
INT. MOVING CAR - DAY 
Dad and Mason are driving along the open road, listening to a song by Wilco. 
DAD Now... listen to this song, alright? 
Sings along: 
DAD (CONT'D) "I try to stay busy" It's just straight up, the lyrics... it's a straight up old school country song. 
SONG "I do the dishes, I mow the lawn..." 
DAD Listen to the production of this. Production's like uh, like "Abbey Road" or something. 
SONG "I try to keep myself occupied" 
Dad sings along. 
DAD "Even though I know you're not comin' home." You know, his old woman's gone... straight up. Nothin' fancy. 
DAD AND SONG "I try to keep the house nice and neat. Make my bed. I change the sheets." 
EXT. RIVERBED - DAY 
Mason and Dad walk along the rocks, mid-conversation. They sit down near the water and begin taking off socks and shoes. 
MASON Yeah, I think she's about to get her master's degree. 
DAD Well, then she's gonna start applying for teaching jobs? 
MASON I think she already has. 
DAD Really?   Where? 
MASON (shrugs) All over. 
DAD All over Texas? 
MASON Yeah. 
DAD Well, if you gotta move, you gotta move, you know? It's no big deal. We can handle that. I'll still come get you every other weekend. I mean, unless she moves 500 miles away or something, it'll just be a little more car time. No big deal. 
MASON I'm just kinda sick of moving. 
DAD Well, I bet you are. But you know, you never know. I mean, I might have to move, right? I'm working for this insurance company now. These places get bought and sold all the time. You know? We'll just roll with it. 
They take off pants, walk up to the water in boxer shorts. 
MASON I thought you were a musician? 
DAD I am but... life is expensive, you know. Guy's got to be responsible. What do you think? 
Mason pushes his Dad into the water, then dives in himself. 
DAD (CONT'D) Hey, hey, you bast -- Oh you, punk kid! You got no respect! 
Dad splashes his son and they both begin to swim. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. FOREST - DAY 
Mason and Dad are now hiking through the woods. 
MASON You know that redhead at the bowling alley? 
DAD Sure.     What about her? 
MASON Do you know her well? 
DAD Ahhh, you know, we've hung out a little bit. 
MASON Is she your girlfriend? 
DAD How do you mean? 
MASON Like... have you kissed her? 
DAD Um... Yeah. Yeah. I've kissed her. What about you? You got a girlfriend? 
MASON Sort of. 
DAD Really.     Have you uh, have you kissed her? 
MASON Not really. 
DAD Yeah.     Well, what have you done? 
Bully #2 walks over to join the altercation. 
BULLY #2 I don't think pretty boy's hair's good enough. 
Bully #2 tries to mess with Mason's hair. Mason blocks his hand. 
BULLY #2 (CONT'D) Hey!   Don't touch me, faggot! 
Another student enters. The two bullies start to walk away. Bully #1 shoves Mason and flips him off, as they exit. 
BULLY #1 You're a fuckin' asshole. 
EXT. SCHOOL - AFTERNOON 
Mason leans against the wall of the school, waiting for Samantha to pick him up. When he realizes she isn't coming, he starts to walk away. 
EXT. DOWNTOWN SAN MARCOS - MOMENTS LATER 
Mason is now passing through an alley with JILL, who walks her bike alongside him. 
JILL    (O.S.) Hey, Mason! 
MASON Hi Jill. 
JILL So, where are you going? 
MASON Over to the college. 
JILL What's going on there? 
MASON My mom's a teacher. 
JILL Oh, cool!     What does she teach? 
MASON Psychology... I think.      What are you up to? 
JILL Oh, my mom owns Needleworks. (MORE) 
JILL (CONT'D) The arts and crafts store over there? So I'm just kind of hanging out. But I'm supposed to be going to the hospital soon. 
MASON How come? 
JILL You know Courtney? Girl with the dyed black hair and the nose ring? Wears Hot Topic every day? 
MASON I... think so. 
JILL We used to be best friends growing up, but we've kinda grown apart. She sorta got all emo. She thinks I'm a prep. But, I still consider her a friend! Anyway, she cut one of her wrists. I don't know how bad, but I think I should go visit. 
Jill glances down at the book in Mason's hand. 
JILL (CONT'D) So what are you reading? 
MASON Oh, it's uh, "Breakfast of Champions". Kurt Vonnegut. 
JILL I think my older brother likes him. I'm reading "To Kill a Mockingbird" for the third time. My friends make fun of me. I think I'm the only girl in the whole school who doesn't like the "Twilight" books. Have you read them? 
MASON Sure haven't. 
JILL I tried... but it was so cheesy!   So how do you like San Marcos? 
MASON I like it alright. It's a lot smaller than Houston, but it seems pretty cool. Have you always lived here? 
JILL Yeah. If you want the big city around here, you have to drive to San Antonio or Austin. Have you been there yet? 
MASON I went to San Antonio for a day, but... I haven't been to Austin yet. 
JILL That's where all the high school kids go, on weekends, for shows and stuff. 
MASON That's what I've heard. 
JILL So are you going to Shauna's party next weekend? 
MASON Um... I think I heard about it.    I'm not really sure, though. 
JILL Well you should! 
MASON Why's that? 
JILL Well -- LeeAnn has a big crush on you and I know she was hoping you would go. You don't have a girlfriend, do you? 
MASON Not currently. 
JILL Well then, you should come. I'll tell Chase to make sure you're there. 
MASON Okay. 
JILL But don't tell LeeAnn I told you that. She'd kill me. 
MASON I won't. 
JILL Well, I better get going.   See you later. 
MASON Bye. 
INT. COLLEGE CLASSROOM - DAY 
Mason walks into his mother's classroom. He takes a seat to observe from the back, while she lectures. 
MOM (O.S.) His cognitive series, his interviews with orphans, Ethology theorists' work... And then he in turn was supported strongly by Harry Harlow's rhesus monkey study. Now you guys, you gotta think, this is the 1950's, this was radical! This flew in the face of traditional learning theory, of B.F. Skinner's classical and instrumental conditioning. Now, Bowlby is going to argue that human survival depends on us falling in love. It depends on me falling in love with my mother, and my mother falling in love with me. And if that doesn't happen, we're pretty much doomed. Now think about it. A tiger chases our tribe out of a cave. Now an ideal mother goes, "Huh! My baby! I love you! I'll protect you!" Or... "Well you, why am I going to pick you up? You're going to slow me down. You... are... tiger kibble!" 
The class laughs. 
MOM (CONT'D) So next week we are gonna get into Bowlby's four stages of attachment -- oh oh, uh, Professor Douglas and I -- some of you might have classes with Elena -- she and I are hosting a little pre-Thanksgiving get-together at my place, so if anyone wants to come, please stop by. (pause) I'm not the greatest cook... 
The class laughs again. 
INT. APARTMENT - DAY 
Mason opens the door as he and his mother enter the house. 
MOM Thanks. 
Mom drops her purse on the table and then walks down the hallway to Samantha's bedroom. She knocks on the door before walking inside. 
MOM (CONT'D) Samantha! 
Samantha is sitting on her bed, listening to music with a friend, GABY. 
SAMANTHA Okay!    Mom... 
MOM Why in the hell didn't you pick up your brother like you said you would? 
SAMANTHA Mom, I know what you're gonna say. She was running late and we couldn't turn around. 
MOM No, no! No excuses! The bottom line is you didn't do what you said you were gonna do. You stranded your brother! 
SAMANTHA It's embarrassing to ask my friend to turn around and go get some kid at the middle school. 
MOM What do you mean "some kid"? He's your brother! And you know what? We've helped Janie out before. I mean, she lives right around the corner. It's no big deal. 
SAMANTHA Sorry. 
MOM You know what, Samantha? You need to start thinking long and hard about who you want to be. (MORE) 
SENIOR GUY Yeah, you ever made her, uh, howl into the night? 
MASON A few times. 
TONY (skeptical) Really? 
SENIOR GUY Yeah, right.     What was her name, Lucky? 
MASON Nooo. Jennifer. She doesn't live here, though. She's back in Houston. 
CHARLIE You're fucking lying. 
MASON I don't care if you assholes believe me or not. 
SENIOR GUY Let me guess -- you were pulling all kinds of ass back home, but once you got down here... lefty. 
Senior Guy motions with his left hand. 
MASON Hey, fuck you. I would, but none of the girls here want to. 
CHARLIE Dude, it's not what they want, man. It's what you want. 
SENIOR GUY True dat. 
Senior Guy toasts, as Mason rolls his eyes. 
CHARLIE You know what you should do? Join a band. That's all it takes, man. 
MASON Oh yeah? 
CHARLIE Fuck yeah, dude. You don't even have to play that well. I mean, you start playing your instrument, and they line up to give you blow jobs. (Points to Tony) Except for you. It doesn't impress the ladies so much when you play flute for the marching band. 
TONY I'm not in the fucking marching band. 
SENIOR GUY Ah dude, you sure? I heard you play the skin flute. 
TONY Alright, I got a question for you guys. If you think you're so cool, why are you hanging out with a bunch of eighth graders on a Friday night? 
SENIOR GUY Hey, fuck you, you little penis wrinkle. You know, you're lucky to even be here. This is our camp out. The only reason you little cum gums are here is because fucking Charlie's mom made him bring his little asshole brother, and then he drags along you little dice danglers. Fucking fuzz nut, talking shit! 
Senior Guy throws a beer just past Tony. 
CHARLIE It's all good, man. These little fuzz nuts are going to get their chance soon enough. We got some whores coming by later. 
CHASE Yeah? 
SENIOR GUY Hell yeah! 
CHARLIE Now, I know Chase will fuck anything. I mean, I've seen this kid mount boulders before. But what about you guys? You in? 
MASON Whatever. 
CHARLIE Alright. 
SENIOR GUY Alright, good man. What about you, Peter Puffer? 
TONY I don't know. Maybe. 
SENIOR GUY Dude, it's okay to be gay. We understand. Just, you know, sleep over there. 
TONY I'm not gay. 
CHARLIE Give it some time, man.     You'll realize. 
TONY Fuck y'all. 
CHARLIE See, that's exactly my point, man. Nah, but we don't have whores coming over, we were just fucking with you to see what you'd say. 
SENIOR GUY Yeah, and you just earned your Vag Badge. 
CHARLIE Put it next to your bitch card. 
SENIOR GUY Yeah, 'cause you know, you're a bitch. Now hold this, like the bitch you are, bitch. 
The boys return to breaking boards. 
SENIOR GUY (CONT'D) Alright, this shit is called the Death Punch. 
Senior Guy breaks the board in half with one direct punch. 
BOYS Ohh!    Jesus! 
INT.   MOM'S HOUSE - DAY 
Mom is hosting a pre-Thanksgiving get-together with 10-15 people all drinking wine and talking 
MOM (to Mason and Samantha) Hey, you guys made it! Good. 
Mom places a cheese plate on the living room table. 
MOM (CONT'D) Oh, there you are. 
PROFESSOR DOUGLAS hands Olivia a glass of wine. 
PROFESSOR DOUGLAS And here you go, hostess. 
MOM Oh, thank you. Hey, can I get you a bite? 
INT.   MASON'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Mason sits on his bed, chatting with a COLLEGE GIRL, who looks around his room. There is a large graffiti mural on the wall behind him. 
COLLEGE GIRL (points to the mural) Oh, that's cool. 
MASON Thanks. 
COLLEGE GIRL You did that? 
MASON Yeah. 
COLLEGE GIRL Wow. How long have you been doing that for? 
MASON Not very long. Um, I went to this camp thing just this past summer. 
COLLEGE GIRL They have a camp for graffiti? 
MASON Well, they call it "urban art". 
COLLEGE GIRL Oh. 
MASON So it sounds, you know, less illegal, but... it was really just a way to get free spray paint. 
COLLEGE GIRL Cool. So is this your tag?     Is that -- do they still call it...? 
MASON Yeah, but you know, it's just letters that I'm good at writing. 
COLLEGE GIRL Oh.   K... 
MASON E. 
COLLEGE GIRL E.    Z.   J.   O. Kezjo. That's cool. 
MASON It doesn't really mean anything, though. 
MOM Yeah, a little.     Have you? 
MASON A little bit. 
MOM Have you been...? 
Mom mimes smoking reefer. 
MASON A little bit. 
MOM Oh... okay. 
MASON I'm gonna go to sleep. 
MOM Talk in the morning, huh? 
EXT. JIM'S FRONT YARD - DAY 
Dad and Jim stand around in front of the house. ANNIE opens the doors to the new mini-van, so the kids can load their overnight bags. 
SAMANTHA Hey, Dad! 
DAD Hey!   How you doing? 
Dad kisses Samantha on the cheek. 
SAMANTHA Good!    Whose car is that? 
DAD That's our car.    Hop on in there. 
SAMANTHA (to Annie) Hey! 
ANNIE Hey, sweetie. 
Annie give Samantha a hug. Samantha peeks in the side door of the mini-van, finding baby COOPER in a car seat. 
SAMANTHA Hey Cooper! Hey, how's it goin'? Hello little brother! (to Annie) He's so cute. 
EXT. JIM'S SIDE YARD - CONTINUOUS 
Mom talks with two workers about an exposed pipe in the yard. 
MOM Can we just replace that part of the pipe? 
WORKER No, no it's no good.      Everything is no good. 
MOM (attempting Spanish) Todo... Total? 
WORKER Everything, yes... Mira. 
He shows the broken pipe with his shovel. He asks the other worker to demonstrate the strength of the replacement pipe by standing on it. 
WORKER (CONT'D) See this one is... 
MOM Gusto... it's stronger? 
WORKER Yes.    It's better.   Yes, yes, yes. 
EXT. JIM'S FRONT YARD - CONTINUOUS 
DAD (to Jim) Hey listen, uh, thanks for that camera you got Mason. 
JIM Oh,   yeah... Mason's -- 
DAD He's loving that thing. 
JIM He's all into the photography thing right now. 
DAD Yeah, I know. 
JIM He's actually talking about turning his, uh, his closet into a dark room. The red light and developing, the whole nine... 
DAD Yeah?   You alright with that? 
JIM I probably won't see him for a week... 
DAD Yeah... Right... Well... 
JIM But, you know. He's having a good time. 
DAD At least he's focusing on something. 
JIM Yeah, yeah. 
DAD You know?     That's what I like. 
JIM Yeah, he's all about it. 
EXT.   JIM'S SIDE YARD - CONTINUOUS 
MOM (pointing to the pipe) Okay... Let's go grande. 
WORKER It's good? 
MOM It's good. 
WORKER It's good.    It's better.   Yes. 
He instructs the other worker on how to get started. Mom turns to join the others in front yard. 
MOM Hey, you know, you're smart.    You should be in school. 
WORKER I like school, I need school, but it's hard. I work all day... 
MOM Go to night school. At community college. It's -- It's pretty affordable. 
EXT. JIM'S FRONT YARD - CONTINUOUS 
DAD You're doing a nice job with the house though, it's looking great... really great. 
JIM Thanks. Yeah, you know, some fix- its here and there, you know. We got a good deal on the foreclosure... So, now I'm finding out why. You know? 
DAD (laughs) Yeah. Right? 
Mason walks outside, carrying a duffel bag. 
DAD (CONT'D) Hey bud!     Hey, Happy Birthday! 
The mini-van catches Mason's attention. 
MASON What's that? 
DAD What's that?     That's our new car! Get in it. 
Dad gives Mason a hug.    Jim shakes Mason's hand. 
JIM Alright, have a good weekend.

DAD Hey, how you doing?      Good to see you. 
GRANDPA CLIFF Good.   Good to see you. 
DAD Ah, it's great to see you. 
GRANDPA CLIFF You made it alright, huh?

GRANDPA CLIFF (to Annie) How are you, darling? 
INT. KITCHEN - DAY

DAD Alright, we ready? 
ANNIE Yeah, yeah, get started -- 
NANA Wait, wait, wait... 
INT.   LIVING ROOM - DAY 
DAD Hey, Sam. 
He subtly indicates for her to get off her laptop and join the family. They take their seats in the living room. 
DAD (CONT'D) Hey, still sleeping here? 
GRANDPA CLIFF Oh, yeah, sawin' logs. 
DAD You ready? 
The family sings happy birthday to Mason. Nana brings in the birthday cake, complete with lit candles. 
ALL (singing) Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday, dear Mason... Happy birthday to you! 
DAD Make a wish, make a wish. 
Mason blows out the candles. The family cheers. 
NANA Real good! Presents!      Wait, wait, wait. Here, sweetie. 
Nana hands Mason a wrapped gift. 
DAD Hey Sam, would you get us a knife so we can cut this up? Hey? Alright. 
Sam walks into the kitchen to grab a knife. 
NANA I hope you like it. I heard you didn't have one, so. 
He unwraps the gift. 
NANA (CONT'D) It's a Bible. Is this your first Bible? Look, there's your name... 
MASON Wow. 
NANA ...In gold. And wait-wait-wait-wait. Look at this. It's a Red Letter edition, and that means that everything Jesus said is in red. 
MASON Thank you. 
NANA Like it?     Alright. I love you, sweetie.     Happy Birthday. 
ANNIE And this one's from us. 
Annie hands Mason a large gift box. 
DAD It's not going to make all your dreams come true, here, you know. Just keep your expectations low. No, no, no, no, you need it. It's... 
Dad pulls a blue dress shirt, blazer, and tie out of the box. 
DAD (CONT'D) It's -- hey! Come, on right? You gotta have it. You need this. 
NANA Wow! 
DAD You've got life ahead of you.   You know -- 
ANNIE And the shirt is blue, and I know you like blue. 
DAD You've got dances -- 
NANA It's beautiful! 
DAD -- And job interviews. Here, I'm going to get it all wrinkled here. 
Grandpa comes out of the kitchen with a covered gun. 
GRANDPA CLIFF Mason? 
DAD (whispers) The Black Album was from me. 
NANA Uh-oh. 
GRANDPA CLIFF Come here, son. Pull that off. 
Mason walks over and pulls the case off to reveal a shotgun. 
GRANDPA CLIFF (CONT'D) There's a 20 gauge shotgun. 
MASON Wow. 
GRANDPA CLIFF Yeah. My dad gave it to me when I was a little younger than you, and his dad gave it to him, and well, you're fifteen and I'd like for you to have it. Alright? Here, you hold it. Yeah. 
MASON (taking the gun) Thank you. 
GRANDPA CLIFF Congratulations, son. I'll teach you how to clean it, teach you how to fire it. I'll teach you a little bit of safety. 
The family laughs, as Mason holds the gun pointing precariously across the room. 
EXT. RANCH HOUSE - DAY 
Samantha holds a pistol, ready to shoot. Dad is helping her aim. There are bottles and cans lined up as targets. 
DAD Now cock it. Alright, there you go. Now, what you want to do is line up the front sight with the back sight, here, you see this little V right here -- 
SAMANTHA Mm-hm. 
DAD Now which one you aiming at? 
SAMANTHA Ah, the middle can. 
DAD The middle can? Alright, alright. Now fire at will, alright? 
SAMANTHA Okay. 
Samantha shoots the can. 
DAD Ho.   Whoa! 
Dad claps as Samantha lowers the pistol. 
SAMANTHA Yeah! 
GRANDPA CLIFF Howdy! 
SAMANTHA You're not becoming one of those God people, are you, Dad? 
DAD And what's that supposed to mean, hm? 
ANNIE I can hear you! 
DAD Well, I think that shotgun should live at my house, huh. I don't think your mom would love that. 
Dad picks up a rock. 
DAD (CONT'D) Hey, look out, Sam. Let me show you how it's done. 
Dad skips the rock across the pond.   Mason photographs it. 
SAMANTHA Nice, Dad. 
She laughs. 
DAD Still got the goods, hmm? 
INT. DARKROOM - DAY 
Mason is developing a picture in the darkroom.   His teacher, MR. TURLINGTON, wanders in. 
TURLINGTON How long you been in here, Mason? 
MASON I'm not sure. 
TURLINGTON I'm sure. All class. Did you complete your image diary? 
MASON Not yet. 
TURLINGTON Completed your, uh, digital contact sheet? 
MASON Not quite, but... I mean, it's not gonna take me long. 
TURLINGTON Not yet. Not quite. Darkroom time is extra-curricular. I mean technically, you don't ever have to be in here these days, and certainly not until you've completed your assignments. That's the deal. 
MASON Sorry. 
TURLINGTON I'm worried about you, Mason. 
MASON Why is that? 
TURLINGTON I'll tell you why. The images you're turning in, they're cool. You're looking at things in a really unique way. Got a lot of natural talent. 
MASON Thanks. 
TURLINGTON Yeah, but, that and fifty cents will just get you a cup of coffee in this old world. I've met a lot of talented people over the years. How many of them made it professionally without discipline, commitment, and a really good work ethic? 
Mason shrugs and shakes his head, unsure. 
TURLINGTON (CONT'D) I can tell you. I can count it on two fingers. Zero. It's not gonna happen for you, Mason. The world is too competitive. There are too many talented people who are willing to work hard. And a butt-load of morons who are untalented, who are more than willing to surpass you. As a matter of fact, a lot of them are sitting in that classroom out there right now. Hm? You know what they're doing? They're doing their assignments, which is what you're supposed to be doing, but you're not. You're in here. Why is that? Are you special, Mason? 
MASON No, but I mean the things you're talking about, like work ethic or whatever, I feel like I do work pretty hard. I spend the whole weekend taking pictures a lot of times. 
TURLINGTON You like football, Mason? 
MASON Not really. 
TURLINGTON Yeah, I know you don't. That's why I've just assigned you to shoot the football game tonight. Okay? It starts at 7:30. I want you to get there early. I want you to shoot a full card, three hundred images, and I want 'em downloaded, I want 'em sorted, and I want to see them very first thing Monday. Okay? You want to know why I'm doing this? 
MASON I guess. 
TURLINGTON Who do you want to be, Mason?    What do you want to do? 
MASON I want to take pictures.    Make art. 
TURLINGTON Any dip-shit can take pictures, Mason. Art, that's special. What can you bring to it that nobody else can? 
MASON That's what I'm trying to find out. 
TURLINGTON Try harder. Hey, maybe in twenty years you can call old Mr. Turlington and you can say, "Thank you, sir, for that terrific dark room chat we had that day." (walking away) Get back to class and do your work. 
INT. CLASSROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Mason walks back to his computer.    NICK sits at the neighboring computer. 
NICK Hey man.   You're walkin' a little funny. 
MASON Fuck you. 
NICK I'm just saying, you guys were in there for a long time. Just hope he bought you dinner first. 
Mason playfully jabs Nick in the arm. 
INT. JIM'S HOUSE - DAY 
Jim sits at the kitchen table, opening a beer. Mom and Samantha prepare dinner in the kitchen. Mom walks over to the stairs to call up to Mason. 
MOM Mason!   Honey, come down for dinner. 
On her way back to the kitchen, Mom notices the screen on an open laptop. 
MOM (CONT'D) Samantha! You didn't post these pictures and their descriptions? Come on, this auction is going to end on Sunday, honey. You've got to get those posted. 
SAMANTHA Why are we even doing this? It's like an online junk shop. I thought you had a good job? 
MOM I do. We're what you call house poor. Everyone's got to do their part. Your brother took the pictures. You have to help. 
SAMANTHA Who even buys this shit? 
JIM Hey, Sam, watch your mouth, alright? Don't disrespect your mother. You like a roof over your head, don't you? 
MOM Yeah, and you like having electricity so that you can charge your cell phone? 
SAMANTHA I'm not even gonna be here next year. I'm a senior. I should be having fun. 
Mason enters. He sits down at the table.   He has blue nail polish on his fingernails. 
JIM Nice nails. 
MASON Yeah, some girl did that in sixth period. 
JIM You planning on keeping them? 
MASON Until it comes off, I guess. 
JIM Last summer it was the earrings, and now the nails. You got a, uh, you got a purse to go with all that? 
SAMANTHA A lot of guys do that.   He's just trying to be cool. 
JIM When I was in high school, having a job, being responsible, being able to afford a car, that was cool. 
MOM Mason, honey, why don't you get you and your sister some water. 
Mason gets up to help set the table. 
EXT. FOOTBALL GAME - NIGHT 
An announcer comments on the game over the loud speaker. The crowd cheers and the band plays. Mason is on the sidelines, photographing details he finds interesting. He scrolls through the images on his camera. 
NICK Hey man, Turlington says to cut the artsy crap and shoot the game. So take your lens and point it that way. 
The girls laugh. 
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) His minor, yeah. 
SHEENA Does he wanna... does he wanna teach? 
SAMANTHA I don't know, I think, I think he's still figuring stuff out. Yeah, he'll figure it out, he's smart, he's smart. So where are you thinking about living when you come here? 
SHEENA Um, I'm not really sure yet. We're gonna look at apartments tomorrow, um, but I know my parents sorta were expecting me to live in a dorm. 
SAMANTHA Yeah. 
SHEENA Yeah. But I mean, I'm paying my way through college, so it doesn't really matter that much. 
SAMANTHA Yeah, you don't have to listen to your parents after you turn eighteen. I mean, especially if they're not helping you financially. 
They laugh. 
SHEENA That's what I figured. 
SAMANTHA But I mean, living in a dorm isn't so bad. 
SHEENA Yeah. 
SAMANTHA I mean especially if it's a coed dorm. I mean, I've never been around like, so many cute guys at once. Like, college is really fun. 
They laugh. 
SHEENA I'm excited. 
SAMANTHA It's great, yeah. 
EXT. SIDEWALK - NIGHT 
The sidewalk is populated with college students. The teens walk together in couples and pass a street musician and a woman hoola-hooping. 
BOYFRIEND Watch out. 
SAMANTHA Oh! 
They laugh. 
INT. CONTINENTAL CLUB - NIGHT 
A four man band plays as our guys watch from the audience. 
MUSICIANS (singing) "On the day that I was born I started growin' old. No one told you life would be so lonesome and cold. I had a grey hair by the age of 23, this hard-luck livin's gonna be the end of me. The old black crow leaving tracks all across my face, and everywhere I go I seem to be in the same damn place. Hard livin's gonna be the end of me." 
EXT. CONTINENTAL CLUB - NIGHT 
Sheena and Mason wander out of the club and walk up the street. 
INT. CAFE - NIGHT 
Sheena and Mason are seated at a table at a late-night diner, full of a variety of people. 
MAN ALONE IN BOOTH The last death at the Hoover Dam construction site was his son, Patrick Tierny, who died on December 20th, 1935, exactly thirteen years to the day. 
Sheena notices a table of sorority girls and practically whispers to Mason. 
SHEENA See those sorority girls over there? I've just decided, if you delete your Facebook page, I'm pledging. 
MASON Yeah, in just a few years that's you (Indicates Girls) And that's gonna be me. 
He subtly indicates the Man Alone guy, still sitting at his booth, giving a lecture of some kind, with data, etc. 
MAN ALONE IN BOOTH ...Also inlaid into the terrazzo floors was a star map, a celestial map of heavenly bodies so accurately displayed that one could chart the procession of the Pole Star fourteen thousand years into the future, such that future generations upon... (Continuing Indistinct Under) 
SHEENA (O.S.) I wonder what his deal is. I mean, he obviously has money to eat here. 
MASON (O.S.) He just said. He's a UT professor, tenure and everything. 
SHEENA Look at all these people. What are they even doing here at 3:00 in the morning? 
MASON What are WE even doing here at 3:00 in the morning? 
SHEENA We know what we're doing here. 
She dips a chip into a bowl of queso. 
SHEENA (CONT'D) Queso.   We have a purpose. 
MASON Hell yeah. 
SHEENA HELL yeah. 
MASON You know, by, like, next summer this'll just be our lives. 
SHEENA Mm-hm. 
MASON Stayin' out all night and goin' to shows... whatever we want. 
SHEENA We ever gonna go to class? 
MASON Sometimes. 
SHEENA When it feels right.     When the inspiration hits. 
MASON Only then. 
A WAITRESS comes by their table. 
WAITRESS Anything else? 
SHEENA Uhhh... more queso? 
MASON (nodding) Yeah. 
WAITRESS Mm-hm. 
She leaves, and Mason just takes it all in. 
MASON Ah, Jesus. 
SHEENA What? 
MASON I don't know, doesn't it all seem a little overwhelming? I mean, college? I mean, I like the idea of being away from home and gaining skills and getting better at photography. I just, I don't know, I'm not counting on it being some big transformative experience. 
SHEENA I don't think it's that transformative. I just see it as the next step. 
MASON But it's like a pre-ordained slot that's already got your name and number on it. I don't think it's the key to my future. Cause, like, I mean, look at my mom. She got her degree, and got a pretty good job, she can pay her bills... 
SHEENA Well, I like your mom. 
MASON Well, I like my mom, too. I just mean, basically, she's still just as fucking confused as I am. 
Waitress drops off more queso. 
SHEENA (to Waitress) Thank you. 
MASON Thanks. 
Mason and Sheena dip chips into the bowl of queso. 
MASON (Bitter Laugh) Of course you don't. 
SHEENA You know, it's actually kind of a relief not to have to be around someone who's so gloomy all the time. The world's not so horrible. Not everything's some big conspiracy against humanity. 
MASON (O.S.) It's great that you can think that way. And you know, I'm sure dating a jock really helps to clear the mind. 
SHEENA He's not a jock, okay? He just happens to be on the lacrosse team. We're all going to other schools next year anyway, it's not some super serious relationship. 
MASON Great.   I feel so much better now. 
SHEENA We're just having fun. 
MASON I bet he's having fun. 
SHEENA Grow up, Mason. 
MASON It's not like I haven't been with anyone else. 
SHEENA Who? 
MASON What do you care? 
SHEENA Who? 
MASON Does it matter? 
SHEENA You're the one who brought it up. 
A pause. 
SHEENA (CONT'D) This is pointless. 
She gets up and starts to walk away. 
SHEENA (CONT'D) Now you're just trying to be an asshole. 
EXT./INT. NICK'S CAR 
Nick drives Mason home from graduation. 
NICK Holy Crap, I would rather have my balls clawed off than ever sit through anything like that ever again! 
MASON Well, we never, ever have to. 
NICK Oh my god, thank you. 
MASON Gimme that. 
Nick hands him a flask. 
NICK Dude, it's all you. Drink up. So you coming out with me tonight, brother? Should be some pretty awesome stuff happening. 
MASON Naw, dude, I'm goin' to this like, show with my dad in Austin. His friend's playing. 
NICK Gosh, have fun with that, I guess. 
Nick pulls into Mason's driveway and parks. 
MASON Fuck, there's so many cars here.    I don't wanna go in there. 
NICK (sarcastic) Dude, you will have so much fun. Your family loves you. You'll have a swell time. 
MASON Fuck you.   You're coming in with me. 
NICK Oh, no.   Shit no.   No. 
MASON Yes!   Yes, you are. My mom loves you.   You have to say hi. 
NICK Just -- 
MASON Do you want to hurt her feelings? 
NICK Mm-mm. (Shakes head slightly) 
MASON Well then, let's go get 'em. 
NICK Just for a second.    Just a second, seriously. 
Nick "tests" his breath in his hand. They get out of the car. 
INT. MOM'S HOUSE - GRADUATION PARTY - DAY 
Family and friends chit chat throughout the house. Mom prepares snacks, while Dad and Annie talk with UNCLE STEVE. 
UNCLE STEVE You know you're in sort of in enemy territory here. 
DAD (laughing) We're aware. 
INT. KITCHEN - GRADUATION PARTY - CONTINUOUS 
Cake graphic: "Congratulations Mason!" 
Olivia and Carol prep food.   Nick and Mason come in the front door. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - GRADUATION PARTY - CONTINUOUS 
DAD Uh, look who's here! 
ALL (cheer, applause) ...Whooo! 
MOM Hey! 
She hugs Mason. 
UNCLE STEVE Get a job! 
Mason takes off his graduation cap. 
MOM No-no-no-no, wait. We're gonna take pictures. Put it back on. (To Carol) Hey, can you get a camera? (To Nick) Hey Nick! 
Grandma comes over and hugs Mason. 
GRANDMA Oh! Back on. Oh... Congratulations, baby. (to Nick) I don't know you, but congratulations! 
She hugs him too. 
GRANDMA (CONT'D) Oh, pictures, pictures, Carol. 
MOM (O.S.) Quick, put your hat on. 
CAROL Alright, look here... 
They pose and Carol takes the picture with a phone. 
MOM Smile. 
CAROL Here we go. Oh, that's a good one. And... good! Got it. 
GRANDMA (O.S.) Oh, we need -- Sam, where are you? Samantha! 
MOM Sam! 
GRANDMA And where's Mason senior?   I'm feeling generous. (to Dad) Come here. 
ANNIE Yes, that's right. 
GRANDMA And with your little one.    Where is he? 
ANNIE Oh, he's at home. 
DAD Yeah, yeah. Remember, he was such a pain at Sam's thing that, you know... 
GRANDMA Oh, I would love to see him. 
ANNIE Well, we have a special weekend this weekend, so... 
GRANDMA I'm so glad you found her. I really am. (to Annie) You, you've got him at a good time, I think. 
ANNIE I think so, too. 
GRANDMA Yeah.   It's good to see you two. 
DAD Nice to see you, too, Catherine. 
GRANDMA I'm so proud of your boy. 
DAD Yeah, yeah we all are. 
Grandma walks off.    Dad whispers to Annie. 
DAD (CONT'D) If you think she's a bitch now, you should have seen her fucking twenty years ago. 
They laugh. 
INT. DEN - GRADUATION PARTY - CONTINUOUS 
Later, Uncle Steve, Dad, and Mason have a manly discussion. 
UNCLE STEVE You got to remember, you're going to college, though, alright? And if you're anything like me or your old man, you're gonna be pulling down some serious wool. You're gonna be tapping some masterful gap. 
DAD Steven... 
UNCLE STEVE You're gonna be doing some good work out there. Think about it, awful lot of flowers in that bouquet. But, you gotta do me a favor. You're going to be vulnerable this summer, alright. Remember to use protection during breakup sex. 
He puts his hand on Dad. 
UNCLE STEVE (CONT'D) This guy knows exactly of which I speak. Look what happened to him. Viola'. 
Uncle Steve gestures to Mason. 
DAD Steven... 
UNCLE STEVE (laughing) Cheers. 
DAD It's not that simple. 
UNCLE STEVE (chanting) Four more years. Four more years. I'm just saying. 
INT. KITCHEN - GRADUATION PARTY - CONTINUOUS 
Later Dad enters the kitchen where Mom happens to be. 
DAD Do y'all recycle?   Should I -- 
MOM I have one started there. 
DAD Oh, yeah, right. Okay, great. Okay. Am I, uh, am I your only ex at this party? 
MOM Yes, but I'm not your only wife here, though. 
DAD Yeah. 
MOM Can you believe they're both out of high school? 
DAD No.  No, I can't. (a beat) You did a great job with both of them, by the way. 
MOM Thanks for saying that. I never thought I'd hear you say that. 
DAD Well, it's true.    Thank you. 
MOM And you're doing it all over again, huh? 
DAD I know, I know, right? It's gonna be uh, fifteen years till I have an empty nest. But hey, I'd love to pitch in, help with this, if I could. (MORE) 
DAD (CONT'D) I mean, it's so great that you did this. I was just going to give you a little. I'd appreciate it if I could. 
He pulls out his wallet. 
MOM Sure.   Yeah. 
DAD Yeah. But I don't have any cash. It's in Annie's purse. I'll be right back. 
INT. ANTONE'S - EVENING 
Mason and Dad are wandering through the green room area while the band is doing a sound check. 
DAD ...So it sucks. I mean, the guy's a college lacrosse player. I mean, what are you gonna do? 
MASON She didn't even like sports. 
An iced-down bucket of drinks beckons. 
DAD You want a beer? 
MASON No, that's alright. 
DAD You can have one. 
MASON It's okay. 
They continue their conversation out of the green room to a little area overlooking the stage. 
DAD Yeah, well, for what it's worth, we've all been through the exact same thing, at one point or another. 
MASON It's not the same, though.     I mean, you never got to know her. 
DAD No, I know, I know.    It's not the same. 
MASON I just don't know what I did wrong. 
At this point Dad yells down to Jimmy, his roommate from years before, briefly interrupting the sound check. 
DAD Hey, Jimmy.    Hey, man.   Hey -- 
JIMMY Hey, Mason. 
DAD We're up here raiding the green room. Hope that's okay. 
JIMMY That's totally cool. 
DAD Alright. 
JIMMY Wow!   Is that M.J.? 
DAD Uh-huh.    Right? 
JIMMY Unbelievable. 
MOM Thanks. 
ERNESTO You guys should listen to her.   She's a smart lady. 
MOM Thank you. 
Ernesto walks back toward the kitchen, leaving the three seated at the table. 
EXT. APARTMENT - MORNING 
Mason, now with a scruffy beard, is wedging a duffel bag and bin into the bed of his truck. He walks back toward Mom's new apartment. 
INT. APARTMENT - MORNING 
Mason is packing a box, in mid-conversation with Mom, who is seated in another room. 
MASON ...Isn't that kind of crazy though, that a computer knows who you are from just twenty questions off a form? I guess there are really only like eight types of people in the world. 
Mom goes to the kitchen and pours coffee into a mug. 
MASON (CONT'D) I mean there are subsets, like male and female, but apparently we're not as unique as we want to think we are. 
MOM Have you even talked to this guy yet? 
MASON No, but we've been trading emails. He seems pretty cool. He's studying literature, and uh, anthropology, and he's way into Bright Eyes... so that's not so bad. But anyways, he was telling me about how the system they use for assigning roommates is kind of spooky. Like, the Freshmen satisfaction rate for new roommates used to be like 60%, and now it's 100%. Just cause of the computer. 
MOM Well. Sounds like he'll be a good roommate, then. 
MASON Yeah. But we've pretty much decided that soon they won't even need a questionnaire. Because they'll just let the NSA scan your digital ghost, and they'll tell you who your roommate is, based on everything you've ever said, written, or clicked. 
Mason walks back into the living room, carrying a box.   He holds up a framed picture. 
MASON (CONT'D) Did you -- Did you put this in here again? 
Mom laughs. 
MASON (CONT'D) I don't want it. 
MOM Come on, it's the first picture you ever took. 
MASON Well, I mean, all the more reason to leave it behind, right? 
Mason goes to put the picture back in his room, while Mom suddenly breaks into quiet sobs. 
He comes back out, wearing a backpack, and notices Mom crying. 
MASON (CONT'D) What? 
MOM (crying) Nothing. 
MASON No, what is it? 
MOM Nothing! 
MASON Mom... 
MOM This is the worst day of my life. 
MASON What are you talking about? 
MOM I knew this day was coming. I just -- I didn't know you were gonna be so fuckin' happy to be leaving. 
MASON I mean, it's not that I'm that happy. What do you, what do you expect? 
MOM You know what I'm realizing? My life is just gonna go, like that! This series of milestones. Getting married, having kids, getting divorced, the time that we thought you were dyslexic, when I taught you how to ride a bike, getting divorced AGAIN, getting my masters degree, finally getting the job I wanted, sending Samantha off to college, sending YOU off the college... You know what's next? Huh? It's my fuckin' funeral! 
A beat. 
MOM (CONT'D) Just go, and leave my picture! 
Stunned, Mason doesn't know what to say. 
MASON Aren't you jumping ahead by like, forty years or something? 
MOM I just thought there would be more. 
Mom sits at the table crying.   Mason does not know how to comfort her. 
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY 
Mason drives his pick-up truck through the open roads and mountains of West Texas. 
EXT. GAS STATION - DAY 
Mason stops at a gas station to fill up.   While he waits, he takes pictures. 
EXT. UNIVERSITY - DAY 
Mason pulls into the parking lot of his University and parks. 
INT. DORM - AFTERNOON 
Mason walks through a hallway area and finds his dorm room. He enters to find it half decorated with music going. He throws his bag up on the available bed and starts to unpack and get situated. DALTON enters. 
DALTON Hey, you must be Mason. 
MASON Yeah.   Dalton, right? 
DALTON Yeah, man, it's nice to finally meet you. 
MASON Definitely. 
DALTON Are you cool with this side of the room? 
MASON Yeah. 
DALTON Got in this morning, just moved my shit in, man. 
MASON (laughs) Well, yeah. I don't- I don't care. No worries. 
He unzips his bag, but keeps the conversation going. 
DALTON Cool. Can I help with anything, man? Any bags? Any last stuff you need brought in? 
MASON I just got like one... box left, I packed pretty light. But I appreciate it. 
DALTON My pleasure, man. Of course. 
MASON Um, are you goin' to the orientation mixer thing? 
DALTON Orientation mixer thing? Fuck no, man! I'm not goin' to that and neither are you, by the way. We got way better stuff to be doin', dude. 
BARB, Dalton's girlfriend, drifts into the room. 
BARB You ready? 
DALTON Yeah. Hey, Barb, this' my roommate Mason. Mason, Barb. 
They shake. 
MASON Hi. 
BARB Hey.   You comin' with us?

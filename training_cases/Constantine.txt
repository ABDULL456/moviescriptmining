EARLY PRODUCTION DRAFT 
November 14, 2002 
FADE IN: 
EXT. ISTANBUL - DUSK 
Glimpses of an ancient city.   Almost motionless against the tide of time. Sea swelled along an endless wall. Billowing silk frozen against the sky. Birds lighting on Byzantine columns. FINAL IMAGE is of an imposing STRUCTURE beyond the trees. 
INT. PRISON FOR THE CRIMINALLY INSANE 
Corridor of ancient stone and steel extends into infinite darkness. Stale air hangs in the dim half-light like atomized ether. There is WHISPERING.   And tangled VOICES. DRIFT IN PAST prison cells the size of closets. Brief flashes of carved faces, insanity -- COMING TO REST ON the -- 
FINAL CELL 
A gaunt PRISONER kneels on the granite, head bowed to a wall hung tapestry of Christ. But he's not just praying. He's digging. With his arm under the tapestry, he scratches at the stone with a SPOON. After only a year, the spoon finally breaks through. 
INT. NARROW CHANNEL 
Prisoner claws his way between ancient walls, comes to a dead end against a thick wooden door. He nudges a shoulder against it, digs in and pushes. DOOR GROANS open, sucking air into the pitch black CHAMBER. 
INT. PRISONER'S CELL 
The tapestry covering the HOLE is pulled against the wall, then billows outward like a sail. 
INT. CHAMBER - PRISONER 
pulls himself inside, chokes in the heavy air. He scans the musty room. Antique furniture. A few empty crates. And the remains of several deteriorating skeletons. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
He looks to the far wall, sees a hint of light above through the crumbling limestone. A way out. Too high to reach, Prisoner pulls an old CHEST out of a cobwebbed corner and slides it under the light. He steps up onto the chest, grabs the edges of the hole and starts to shove off when the top of the chest gives way and his foot crunches through. Prisoner reaches down to free his foot when he sees something inside -- wrapped in a red cloth. He pulls it out and as he unwraps it, he discovers the cloth is a Nazi flag. At the center is a crudely-shaped IRON RELIC. Eight inches long. Stains on the edges. Could be the petrified tooth of some prehistoric animal. Or maybe an ancient arrowhead. As he holds it, feverish sweat starts to form on his face. 
MYSTERIOUS POV 
From BEHIND. As if he's being watched by someone else. Prisoner spins, looks back AT us. Nothing. 
PRISONER 
starts toward the way out. 
INT. PRISONER CORRIDOR 
The Guard's flashlight beam probes the cell -- one by one -- falls on the tapestry. Christ billows out from the wall, revealing the hole. 
INT. PRISON - VARIOUS SHOTS 
ALARMS SOUND.    Lights BLAST ON.   Guards with weapons rush through. 
INT. NARROW CHANNEL 
Prisoner squeezes toward light, grips the relic tight. 
EXT. PRISON - NIGHT 
SIRENS BLARE as SPOTLIGHTS sweep across the ominous structure. Prisoner breaks from the darkness, runs for the trees on the other side of the wall. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
GUARDS 
(in Turkish) Stop!   Stop! Prisoner spins, griping the relic tight. GUNSHOTS RING OUT. Bullets streak toward him but never hit their target. Guards check their weapons on the run. 
EXT. NEAR A ROAD - NIGHT 
Prisoner breaks from the trees, runs into a road. Headlights wash over him and TIRES SCREECH. Prisoner spins, is right in the path of a car. BRAKES SQUEAL -- car locks up but too late -- IMPACTS Prisoner who is violently thrown and lands in a heap. CAR slides to a stop. DRIVER jumps out, sees the front end sheet metal has accordioned all the way to the tires. He scans the area for a body, spots the Prisoner and is stunned to see him getting to his feet. Uninjured. Prisoner is just as amazed. He glances at the RELIC in his hand, notes the wrist has reddened and an odd SYMBOL has appeared as if embossed in the flesh. Driver calls out but the Prisoner is spooked, runs off. OVER this we hear -- A CHILD'S SCREAM. 
INT. APARTMENT - DAY 
FATHER HENNESSEY (50), stands over a young teen (13), JEANIE, splashes holy water on her body. She screams again. 
HENNESSEY 
Et separatur a plasmate tuo, Ut num quam laedatur amorsu antiqui serpentes! Her body convulses, pulls against the bandages tying her hands and feet to the bed frame. Notice her fingernails. Drained of color. Almost black. Her MOTHER is off to one side, completely hysterical. On the other side is a crowd of bewildered TENANTS, all crammed into the hallway outside the opened door. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Nothing can compare with an exorcism.   Especially one that's gone bad. The rather obese Priest tries to steady his hands and his heart. It's obvious he's totally out of his league here. GIRL lets out another SCREAM that ECHOES OVER -- 
EXT. AGING APARTMENT BUILDING 
Not in a third world country but smack center in one of America's richest cities. Sparkling high-rises tower in the distance while flashy billboards tout the sexiest fashions, the hottest automobiles and the smoothest malt liquor. 
SUPERIMPOSE:   LOS ANGELES - TODAY 
EXT. ALLEY BY THE APARTMENT 
JOHN 
Amar natash bow basar -- Another PULSE and this time a SHAPE is clearly seen expanding under the child's skin -- as if the demon inside were trying to burst right through. John backs off -- watches as the shape ripples her flesh, like fingers caressing from the other side. John glances to Hennessey. What the hell? MIRROR arrives at the doorway, BANGS against the JAM. John waves them in. The four men heft it into the room. 
JOHN 
Lift it.   Over the bed.   Up. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
John ducks, settles on the girl as they raise it over him. 
JOHN 
Hennessey, tie it off -- Hennessey is glad to be called into service -- quickly ties one end of rope to the mirror. John straddles the girl, positions his head between her and the mirror above him. 
JOHN 
Now close your eyes -- all of you -- and whatever happens -- do not look into the mirror. The men close their eyes.        Muscles tense under the weight. 
JOHN 
Amar natash bow basar! -- rescind from the flesh I command thee! Jeanie reacts -- that SHAPE reappears, contorts the young body all out of proportion. John unblocks the mirror for a second and Jeanie is reflected inside. It's not just the image of a young girl in there, but something else. The surface of the mirror FLEXES in the hands of the men. One starts to look -- 
JOHN 
No! Jeanie SCREAMS -- breaks free of the straps. She rises up, grabs John tight around the throat. Nails dig deep. 
HENNESSEY 
John?! 
JOHN 
(looking into mirror) Not yet! John struggles, puts his hands over her mouth -- cutting off her air supply. Question is, who's going to pass out first? Jeanie's body is racked by whatever's inside her. She goes into shock, body collapsing -- shaking -- close to death. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JOHN 
Look!   Look at me! But she's passing out first. John quickly takes the medallion that caused the earlier reaction -- 
JOHN 
Goddamit -- look! -- and presses it against her forehead. Eyes snap wide and John unblocks the mirror. Jeanie locks on her reflection and the image in the mirror changes drastically. 
JOHN 
Smile pretty you vain prick. The child's reflection has now changed to a pissed off DEMON. One that knows it just got suckered in. MIRROR VIBRATES wildly in the men's grip. Demon reflection ripples the glass -- bending it outward into three-D space as the girl takes her last breaths -- 
JOHN 
Now, Hennessey. Now! Hennessey PULLS the rope with all three-hundred-plus pounds as John gives the demon face a full extended 
FINGER. 
JOHN 
For your boss. Demon pushes for him but mirror is jerked into motion. Swings right out the window but catches on a sliver of wood -- 
JOHN 
No you don't. John jumps up and helps push the mirror free. 
EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HUGE MIRROR 
Falls SLOW MOTION from the 7th story -- tumbling end over end, sunlight beams glancing off the glass, PROJECTING the image of the Demon into the LA cityscape. ONTO buildings, sidewalks, a passing truck -- until all three hundred pounds of IRON AND GLASS come CRASHING down ON the taxi's hood. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
CHAZ 
SHIT! 
Demon's image SHATTERS on impact -- GLASS SPLINTERING into a million diamond-like fragments that choke the air. The GROAN of something evil reverberates into the city beyond. Chaz looks up, sees he missed dying by three feet. 
INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS ACTION 
Jeanie GASPS -- takes her first breath as a child again. And CRIES. Mother pulls her in, hugs her tight. Note the girl's fingernails. No longer black. John's beat, reclaims that stub of a cigarette, still burning. Takes a drag. He pushes past Hennessey who is approaching the mother. 
HENNESSEY 
Now about the fee... John slips FROM VIEW into the kitchenette, hides the fact that he has to lean against the door to keep his balance. He catches his breath, looks up and is staring right at a child's crayon drawing magneted to the fridge. A drawing of a figure poking another in the side with a long stick. This image is repeated over and over. John tugs it off the fridge, tucks it away. 
INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - STAIRWELL - LATER 
Hennessey follows John down the spiraling stairs, passing the gathered tenants. A few are freaked, cross themselves. Others horrified. But many want to touch them, shake their hands. A shadowy FIGURE several floors up stares over the rail at the heroes below. Note the slick suit, the polished veneer. This is BALTHAZAR and he definitely does not rent here. He flicks an ancient COIN between his fingers. JOHN pauses, gazes up through the stairwell as if sensing something. No one there. Balthazar is gone. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JOHN shakes off the feeling, continues down the steps where Hennessey is shoving his HAT in front of the tenants. They're gladly giving to the cause. 
HENNESSEY 
Thank you.     Yes... Gracias... 
JOHN 
CONTINUED: 
MAN (O.S.) 
Or how 'bout you show yourself and I put a bullet in your skull just like I did hers! 
ANGELA 
That's just not going to happen. 
MAN (O.S.) 
You sure about that?! Angela checks the chamber -- sees she has one bullet left. 
ANGELA 
(almost pleading) Now put down your weapon on the tracks and -- GROUND BEGINS to VIBRATE.     Tunnel starts to GLOW. 
MAN (O.S.) 
Well ain't this a peach?! Angela looks back, sees several SHADOWS of figures waving far off. Her RADIO is flooded with futzed CHATTER. 
DETECTIVE WEISS (V.O.) 
(over radio) Get off the tracks! Blueline is coming! Clear the tracks! Angela peeks over the track.     Still no sign of her perp. The TRAIN is coming INTO VIEW and its BEAM shoots through the tunnel, turning every particle of dust into a supernova. The SOUND is DEAFENING. 
MAN (O.S.) 
C'mon, Detective, step into the light and be saved!! Angela looks back, squints into the brilliant LIGHT. She grips her GUN and in one burst of flat-out bravado -- rises as she AIMS. And there he is -- the Man rising with his own gun. Angela FIRES as both dive off the track. His BULLET RICOCHETS behind her. Hers finds its mark. Man goes down right in the train's path. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Angela rolls over on the side of the tracks, catches her breath. She closes her eyes and crosses herself as the train roars past in a staccato blur. 
EXT. 20 LANES BOWLING ALLEY - DAY 
Chaz's taxi pulls up, parks. 
TAXI TRUNK 
OPENS, REVEALS suitcases stamped with AIR INDIA.   John starts inside, pauses as Chaz yells -- 
CHAZ 
There are four bags. I have two hands. This give you any ideas? 
JOHN 
Make two trips? John walks in.     Chaz curses under his breath. 
INT. 20 LANES BOWLING ALLEY 
Evening leagues are going strong. John walks in, looks totally out of place. He moves down the BALL RACK area, runs his fingers across the various leftovers, finally stops at a pearl-white dazzler. He lifts it from the rack, steps out into the prep area -- in front of one of the few lanes not in use. Number 13. John snatches a grease pencil from the overhead, scribbles right on the ball -- "PROVISIONS DEPLETED." He fluffs his trench coat back, steps onto the polished wood with his well-traveled Oxfords. Young bowlers on both sides stop to look at this oddity. An attractive brunette is rather curious. John gives her a wink. Her boyfriend doesn't appreciate it. John bowls. Perfect hook ball. Strike! Brunette grins. John returns the smile, heads into the hallway by the pool tables. 
INT. JOHN'S APARTMENT 
Seems small until you walk in and realize it's as long as a bowling lane. Makes that cage enclosed bed at one end seem like it's a mile away. Chaz throws the suitcases on it as John arrives. 
CHAZ 
(yells across room) Simple question. How much longer do I have to be your slave? John pulls a chain and a wall of window shutters open. 
JOHN 
You're not my slave, Chaz. You're my very appreciated assistant. Like Tonto and Robin and that skinny fellow with the fat friend. Along the floor, encircling the entire room, are 5 gallon Sparkletts bottles. Each is adorned by a small hand- marked CROSS. John takes a moment to adjust one out of place. 
CHAZ 
How much longer? John doesn't like his tone. 
JOHN 
Well I don't know, what's the going rate for saving a taxi driver hanging from his fingernails about to be swallowed into the jaws of Hell? 
CHAZ 
So what time you want me back? John gives him a knowing look, goes back to emptying his pockets. 
JOHN 
I need to make an appearance at Midnite's. Say ten-ish? Chaz sighs, starts out -- 
JOHN 
Chaz...? Chaz turns back, catches an object John throws him. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JOHN 
A little something from Delphi. It's a dashboard air freshener shaped like a cow. Chaz tips it.     Moooooo.   John finds it rather amusing. 
CHAZ 
Gee, thanks. Chaz leaves. John removes a small BLACK BOX from his jacket. He sets it carefully on its own shelf by the window -- stares out. 
BEEMAN (O.S.) 
'Provisions depleted?' John turns to see BEEMAN waddle in. 
BEEMAN 
Locker door opens and Angela is there, covered in the grime of the subway. She's pained as she pulls off her shoulder holster. Looks at herself in the door mirror. Tired, aging eyes stare back. 
WEISS (O.S.) 
Gutsy move out there, Dodson. Angela glances at DETECTIVE WEISS as he opens his locker. 
ANGELA 
Gutsy?    Well that's a new one. The two exchange a look. 
WEISS 
You're alive. Bad guy's dead. No point in using the other words. 
ANGELA 
Thanks. 
WEISS 
(shuts his locker) Even though it was reckless -- irresponsible -- stupid... 
ANGELA 
I knew you still cared. 
WEISS 
You're good, Angela, real good but one of these days... 
ANGELA 
(heard it before) I know, nobody's luck lasts forever. He meets her eyes.    Exactly.     He really does care. Weiss breaks it off, leaves. Angela turns to close her locker door, notices her reflection does not turn. She grabs the door, looks back in. Reflection is as it should be. She shudders, slams the locker door. 
EXT. CLUB MIDNITE - 10 PM 
So exclusive there's not even a line out front. Just a pair of bouncers waiting to roll someone just for fun. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Chaz follows John from the cab to the entrance. A Bouncer selects a PICTURE CARD from a deck. On the front are TWO FLYING DOLPHINS. Only we can see the back, which is -- 
JOHN 
Two frogs on a bench. Yep. They let him pass. Chaz steps up and lucky him -- he gets the same TWO FLYING DOLPHINS. 
CHAZ 
Two frogs on a bench. But Chaz is stiff-armed because the back of this card shows a BEAR in a dress. 
CHAZ 
What?   But I'm with him!   Right, John?   John? John glances back -- gives him an impassive look.   Chaz backs away, stares after him. Someday. 
INT. CLUB MIDNITE 
MUSIC FLOODS this exclusive establishment. It's a clash of cultures and influences not easily dated. A retro speakeasy for the new millennium. John walks through a maze of passages while the fantasies of a twisted city play out in the shadows. He pauses, sees a clan of suited businessmen in a corner, showing off for several ladies. One fills a line of shot glasses from a pitcher of water. Another waves his hand over them, turns the water into RED WINE. The ladies are very impressed, drink up. NICO, a young black man, walks past John. 
NICO 
Neighborhood's going to Hell. John offers a half smile. He likes this kid, walks on. One of the men in the group turns, watches John. Balthazar. He grins and pockets that odd COIN. 
INT. HALLWAY 
John starts up a long flight of stairs, stops in front of two very large doors. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Their surface is ancient, the wood petrified over countless centuries. John places his fingers into the gnarled folds, closes his eyes -- 
JOHN 
Numquam leadatur a morsu. A living GROAN BELLOWS from the rigid seams but the doors don't budge. 
JOHN 
Bastard changed the code again. (bangs the doors) Midnite! Come on, do I have to huff and puff here?! The doors unlatch. 
INT. MIDNITE'S OFFICE 
SWEEP ACROSS a meticulously-crafted ORRERY, a scientific sculpture that normally displays our solar system in relative motion. But the planets here are ancient RELICS with symbols and names -- MATERIAL, ASTRAL, SPIRITUAL, ICONIC, etc. And the globe at the center -- "CREATOR." This is an orrery of the forces of the Universe.      And it's not moving. 
MIDNITE (O.S.) 
Et separatur a plasmate tuo, Ut num quam laedatur amorsu antiqui serpentes... John steps in through the doors behind. 
JOHN 
Deciding which color to paint this place again? PAPPA MIDNITE stands in the jungle he calls an office. Part African witch doctor, part savvy businessman. A full six and half feet of solid contradictions. 
MIDNITE 
You're back early. 
JOHN 
I got tired of spending your money. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Perks of becoming a primary investor. 
JOHN 
What?! Midnite's eyes say it all -- not here, not now. 
BALTHAZAR 
Things change, balances shift. Get used to it, Constantine. 
JOHN 
Not while I'm still breathing -- John starts to cough again. 
BALTHAZAR 
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. John tries to catch his breath, can't. And that scares him a bit. He tries to hide it, pushes out. 
EXT. CLUB MIDNITE 
John SLAMS out the exit -- coughing. He pulls the Vicks 44 from his jacket, struggles with the child protector cap. 
HENNESSEY 
Hey, John. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
John is surprised to see Hennessey waiting. He chokes, is about to bust the Vicks 44 bottle.   Hennessey grabs hold, twists off the cap with one flick. John guzzles the syrup. 
HENNESSEY 
I'm real sorry about this morning, John, real sorry. Please don't hate me for draggin' you into that. Please don't... John can finally breathe. 
JOHN 
I don't hate you. 
HENNESSEY 
That's good to hear. Real good... 
JOHN 
But could you at least wait until I call for you before you show up? 
HENNESSEY 
You didn't call? 
JOHN 
Not yet. Jesus, Hennessey, you freak me out sometimes. 
HENNESSEY 
So you want me to go away and come back? 
JOHN 
No. I've got an assignment for you. 
HENNESSEY 
Really?   What kind of assignment? 
JOHN 
The kind you'll have to be sober for. 
HENNESSEY 
Oh God, you want me to surf the ether. He instinctively touches an AMULET around his neck.       Four intersecting crosses. 
JOHN 
Come on, you know that exorcism wasn't right. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
HENNESSEY 
I... I don't have the Sight anymore. 
JOHN 
Don't have it or don't want to use it? Hennessey vacillates.     This is obviously tough for him. 
JOHN 
Just look around. A few days. You spot anything unusual, anything -- you let me know. Okay? John wraps an arm around his shoulder like a good buddy, then reaches behind his neck -- 
JOHN 
It'll be like old times. -- and unclips the amulet from Hennessey's neck. That unnerves the big guy. John drops it in Hennessey's pocket. 
JOHN 
Just for a few days. 
HENNESSEY 
I'm not staying long either. John glances over and for the second time they make contact. Something about her eyes. John stares a bit too long. Angela looks back toward the fireplace. 
ANGELA 
My business with him is urgent. 
JOHN 
First come, first served. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
ANGELA 
So you're rude no matter where you are. John gives her a look. The two men shake hands and start to part. John and Angela make their move toward the men. Both are surprised when Angela goes for Father Garret and John goes for -- -- the SNOB, officially known as GABRIEL.       Yes, that one. 
FATHER GARRET 
and Angela have retreated to another area for privacy. 
ANGELA 
Why is he stalling on this? My sister needs a Catholic funeral. 
FATHER GARRET 
Angela, it's still considered a mortal sin -- 
ANGELA 
She didn't commit suicide. 
FATHER GARRET 
The Bishop has read otherwise. 
ANGELA 
Father... David -- this is Isabel. (meeting his eyes) Please... Father Garret stares at her, tries to be compassionate. 
FATHER GARRET 
I'll talk to him again. But Angela has just lost a load of faith. 
BY THE FIREPLACE 
Gabriel sits in his chair, watches the fire with unblinking eyes. John approaches from behind and against the backdrop of flame, sees the nebulous shape of wings. The ghostly image is visible for only a heartbeat. 
GABRIEL 
(without looking back) I know what you want, son. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
John sits across from him. 
JOHN 
Been keeping your all-seeing eye on me, have you? 
GABRIEL 
I could offer how a shepherd leads even the most wayward of his flock but it might sound disingenuous. 
JOHN 
So you're going to make me beg? Angela pauses on her way out, looks over. 
GABRIEL 
It wouldn't help. You've already wasted your chance at redemption. 
JOHN 
What about the minions I've sent back, the souls that I've saved -- that should guarantee my passage across -- 
GABRIEL 
(keeping it private) -- No -- passage requires faith and faith by definition is belief without proof. You have proof. And that means you're not playing by the same rules as everyone else. Your work has mostly been for selfish reasons. I'm sorry. 
JOHN 
This is bullshit -- bullshit! Now he's really got Angela's attention. 
JOHN 
It's like you've got some cosmic scale weighing everything we do -- help an old lady across the street -- put in a nickel, kick a dog, take out a dime -- you're fucking nickel and diming us to death down here! 
GABRIEL 
Keep your voice down. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
John jumps up, leans into his face. 
JOHN 
And you know what, you're the ones with the problem, not us -- You make these impossible rules to decide who goes up, who goes down and you don't even understand us -- This more than anything gets under Gabriel's skin. 
JOHN 
That's just it -- this wasn't some possession or wayward half breed, it was a full-fledged demon. Here. On our plane. 
MIDNITE 
Right. 
JOHN 
I know what I saw. 
MIDNITE 
You must have just crossed over and didn't even realize it -- 
JOHN 
I didn't cross over -- It was on this side. Here. 
MIDNITE 
-- it's wet out, you're wandering around aimlessly, not to mention completely emotional -- 
JOHN 
Emotional?! John slams a fist against the counter. The orrery almost topples but Midnite saves it. Decades of work almost lost. Midnite glares at a desperate John. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MIDNITE 
Okay, so you saw something. We've seen a few small ones slip through now and then. 
JOHN 
It's more than that... first the girl, then this. 
MIDNITE 
John, you know my connections. Any shifts or tremors in the planes and I'd hear about it. John just shakes his head, looks up -- convinced. 
JOHN 
Something's coming. Midnite sighs, gives up with him. 
INT. LAPD OFFICE - LATER 
The name JOHN CONSTANTINE is center screen on a monitor -- typed into the police station's SEARCH ENGINE. Angela sits alone in the squad room, rain streaking across the windows. Interpol comes back with results and a list of priors scroll under John's name. Must be a hundred PARKING VIOLATIONS. Several SPEEDING tickets and a few RECKLESS ENDANGERMENT. In fact John's license has been REVOKED. But it's the other incidents that draw Angela in. 
BRIEF CLOSEUPS 
Of specific words in a few HEADLINES -- "Occult activity on the rise..." "Claimed possession is refuted by Bishop..." "Satanic cult dissolved..." Accompanies with an assortment of unusual case photos. -- BLOOD PATTERNS on a WALL -- Odd SYMBOLS burned into a ceiling. A cross burnt to a crisp. -- JOHN in handcuffs looking back at a mother holding her son in her arms. A younger and more noble Father Hennessey stands beside them, looking grateful. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Another line -- "INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE to PROSECUTE." Angela scrolls, sees cities listed where John has made waves -- LONDON -- PARIS -- ROME -- BUDAPEST -- MOSCOW. Stops on the one that matters -- LOS ANGELES. And there's an address. Angela hits PRINT and the HP HUMS away. A desk PHONE RINGS. Angela quickly looks around, sees she's the only one here. She gets up, answers it. 
ANGELA 
L.A.P.D.   This is Dodson, hello? Dead air. The next PHONE RINGS. Angela reaches for it when the NEXT ONE RINGS, and the NEXT, the NEXT. The RINGS HOP phone to phone in intimidating mockery. Angela freezes, forces herself to stay calm.     Sure enough, the RINGS abruptly CEASE. Angela reaches over, rips the page from the printer, leaves. 
INT. ISTANBUL AIRPORT - DAY 
A police guard scans passengers and a printout of the Prisoner. He walks past a man standing in the metal detector line. This is actually the Prisoner wearing the clothes and glasses of the Driver. Is that a blood stain on the lapel? Sweat drops from his forehead and he nervously places the iron relic in a bag he took from the truck driver. He has no choice but to place it on the conveyer belt. 
MYSTERIOUS POV 
Watching the Prisoner.      He looks back AT us, suspicious. Nothing there. 
PRISONER 
looks back nervously, as his bag goes through the detector. 
DETECTOR SCREEN 
shows the folds of the bag, a wallet, a passport and nothing else. The iron relic doesn't even produce an outline. Bag slides out, untouched. Prisoner can't believe his luck, grabs the bag and walks on toward the gates. 
EXT. LOS ANGELES - NIGHT 
VARIOUS of the city -- the contrasts between the bright and cheerful and the dark and mysterious. That abandoned mission behind Bob's Big Boy, the Islamic Temple wedged between competing banks. 
COME TO REST ON -- 
The towering statue of The Good Shepherd. His hands are welcoming us into the "HOLY CROSS CEMETERY." Right across the street is the 20 Lanes Bowling Alley. 
INT. 20 LANES - THE BAR 
John drinks alone.   Pissed at life.      At death. That small black box of his lies on the table unopened. Spider runs across the table. John flips an empty glass, traps it underneath. He takes a drag on his cigarette, tips the glass and blows smoke inside. Spider can't escape the poison air, bumps the glass. Trapped. Dying. 
JOHN 
Welcome to my life. 
ANGELA (O.S.) 
Mr. Constantine? John looks up, spots Angela.        Those eyes again. 
ANGELA 
I saw you at -- 
My sister always talked about a world better than this. Heaven as some call it. She wasn't afraid of dying because she knew it was waiting for her. What everyone fails to grasp is that if she had really taken her own life -- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JOHN 
-- she would have committed a mortal sin and her soul would have gone straight to Hell where it would never feel love or compassion or anything but pain again as the master himself rips her apart over and over for the rest of eternity. (beat) That about right? The words have hit so hard that Angela is speechless. John sees the hurt in her eyes, would like to take it back -- but it's too late. She turns and starts out, slows -- 
ANGELA 
You're not the only one afraid of Hell. John tries not to let that get to him. She leaves. He glances out the window, watches her pass by. So long. Good riddance. But something's not right. Those deep shadows on the buildings seem to be moving. John watches, confused, realizes they're heading in Angela's direction. 
JOHN 
Oh shit... He stands, gains his bearings. As he walks out he flicks the glass over. Spider runs free. 
EXT. 20 LANES BOWLING ALLEY - NIGHT 
Cars are lined all the way down the street. Angela walks along the sidewalk unaware of the shadow following her. It's joined by another in the trees -- both closing in with each step. 
JOHN (O.S.) 
Detective! Angela looks back, sees John in the street. 
JOHN 
How open is your mind? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
She doesn't answer, continues walking. What she doesn't see are the shadows seeping back into the fringes. But John does. He starts walking toward her. 
JOHN 
Do you believe in Heaven and Hell? (off no answer) How about what comes out of each? Angela keeps walking.      He catches up with her. 
JOHN 
Hey! 
ANGELA 
You mean like angels? 
JOHN 
And demons. Angela stares at him, continues walking.       He keeps up. 
JOHN 
See, you don't have the mindset for this kind of work. They walk together down the lonely street. 
ANGELA 
Look, I see terrible things every day. A mother drowns her baby. A ten-year-old shoots his father. But it's not demons, it's the evil that men do. Behind them, a streetlight BLINKS OUT. Then another. They're not looking back so they don't see it. 
JOHN 
You're right, we're capable of terrible things but we usually justify it with motives like money and power and jealousy. Another LIGHT FIZZES, blinks out. 
JOHN 
Then sometimes, something comes along and gives us just the right nudge and we do truly evil things just for the kick of it. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
ANGELA 
I don't believe in demons. 
JOHN 
You should.   They believe in us. They pass another streetlamp as it goes bright, then blacks out. Both look up. The next LAMP FLARES then FIZZES OUT. Angela turns and sees that there are no lights behind them. She looks to John. But he's staring straight ahead. Because now the light in front of them is FLARING 
BRIGHT. 
JOHN 
We should go... Second later it BLINKS OFF.         John grabs her hand -- 
JOHN 
Fast. Angela's confusion turns to tension as a raspy guttural WIND races toward them. John jerks her into action. They run towards the next light. It blinks out right when they reach it. They race to stay in the light, aiming toward the safety of the brightly-lit statue of the Good Shepherd. 
EXT. HOLY CROSS CEMETERY 
They make it through the gate, pass through an alley of overhanging trees. Something RIPPLES through the branches -- flitters right past Angela's face. She swats at it, manages to get a branch across the cheek. They near the Good Shepherd and the floodlights FLICKER, fade out. Statues of saints become dark monoliths. John stops in an OPEN AREA between trees and a mausoleum. A lit CROSS on the wall provides the only illumination. Angela feels the scratch on her cheek, sees a trickle of blood. Now she hears SOUNDS in the darkness. Like LEATHER RUBBING. Surrounding them. 
ANGELA 
What is that? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
John is just as surprised he's saying this -- 
JOHN 
JOHN 
(deadpan) Why, do you have any? John puts his feet, shoes and all into a BUCKET OF WATER. 
JOHN 
I need you to step outside now. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Angela wants to stay. 
JOHN 
Angela?   Please. Angela reluctantly moves toward the exit. John holds the cat, stares into its huge, unblinking eyes. There's a moment where animal and man seem to connect. The water around John's feet begins to BOIL. ANGELA pushes the door closed behind her but it slows on its way to latch. Bulbs pulsate as current ramps down. The room flickers, is suddenly caught in a ghostly dim half-light and John has now crossed over into -- 
APARTMENT IN HELL 
Same layout, different decorator. John takes a deep, raspy breath, slowly stands. He turns to the wall behind him which is torn away, looking like some half-bombed structure in Beirut. Beyond the wall is no longer the blackness of a nightscape but a sickly sepia glow. Not quite day, not quite night. John steps over the crumbling wall into -- 
EXT. HELL LOS ANGELES 
John walks out onto the top overpass of a crumbling maze of intersecting freeways. Burnt-out husks of long- forgotten vehicles sit in rows of gridlock. A low DRONE penetrates the silence. 
JOHN 
Is she here? On the horizon is a dying RED SUN.    It strains to cut through the putrid brown haze. 
JOHN 
Is she here?! His VOICE REVERBERATES to infinity. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
John cautiously steps closer to the railing, looks down to the ribbons of twisting streets below. They're crammed with teeming masses of the damned. All walking down in silence, faces numb with sorrow and grief. 
JOHN 
IS SHE HERE?! 
That low DRONE RISES IN PITCH and John now spots a huge blanket-like BLACKNESS crawling over the cityscape, rapidly closing in on him. You get the feeling this isn't a safe place for the living. 
JOHN 
It's a simple question!    Is she here or not?!! John suddenly locks on something far off. On top of a distant skyscraper is a FEMALE FIGURE in a sheer white gown. John can't make out her face but knows she's looking right at him. 
JOHN 
Isabel? She lifts something and tosses it. John watches as a small object tumbles toward him just ahead of closing darkness. 
INT. ANGELA'S APARTMENT - HALLWAY 
In that same motion we left her in -- Angela finishes pushing the door closed. As it LATCHES -- 
JOHN (O.S.) 
(weakly) Angela... come back in... Confused, Angela pushes the door back open. Cat BOLTS out. Angela catches her breath, moves inside. 
INT. LIVING ROOM 
John sits slumped in the chair, drained. Steam rises off his skin. Angela sees the water in the bucket has almost all boiled out. She walks in, kneels down to him. 
ANGELA 
John?     What happened? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Sweat drips off as he looks up. He opens his palm -- reveals to Angela a simple HOSPITAL BAND. The name "ISABEL DODSON" is typed on it. Even as a semi-convert, this news completely floors Angela. She takes the plastic band -- grips it tight -- tries to hold herself together. The adrenaline and pain overwhelm. Her knee buckle and she drops to the floor. John watches, isn't sure how to help. He finally reaches out a single hand -- slowly rests it on her shoulder. The contact seems to open a floodgate of emotion and Angela falls right into his arms. John hasn't been this close to anyone in a long time. Angela finally composes herself. 
ANGELA 
How?   How did you do this...? John tries not to stare into those eyes too long.     Fails. 
INT. L.A. COUNTY MORGUE - NIGHT 
Body drawer slides open -- reveals Isabel. Lying in a cold, sterile room of death. A Hell of a different type. Hennessey stares down at her, looks around the room again, makes sure he's still alone. He reaches in, rips open the protective plastic and lowers his hand inside. Places it first on her forehead. Nothing. Then on her chest. Nothing. Wrist is last. Hennessey shudders. This is it. He closes his eyes and opens himself to the void -- 
JOHN (V.O.) 
When I was a kid, I saw things... 
FLASHBACK - EXT. STREET - DAY 
A TEN-YEAR-OLD John comes out of a corner store with milk in a bag. He slows, eyes a MAN at a mailbox. 
JOHN (V.O.) 
Things I wasn't supposed to. The man looks right at young John as he passes. His face is distorted and his feet have sprouted roots which are dug into the ground. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
WAITRESS (O.S.) 
Coffee? Young John looks up toward the voice -- 
INT. DINER - NIGHT (PRESENT) 
CONTINUED: 
JOHN (V.O.) 
Heaven and Hell are right here, behind every wall, every face -- the world behind the world. It's crossing over that's the real trick. That's why most demons can only whisper in our ears. But even a whisper can turn your favorite pleasure into your worst nightmare. 
INT. LATE NIGHT RESTAURANT 
HENNESSEY barges in, squeezes past the MAITRE D'. 
MAITRE D' 
Sir, you need a reservation! But Hennessey is on a quest.     For food.   And it's everywhere. He starts grabbing meals right off of plates. Fish, pasta, prime rib. Shovels it all in. Patrons are yelling -- screaming. He's eating as if his life depended on it. And even though he's devouring anything in sight, this huge man is wasting away before our eyes. In the middle of all this chaos is one customer calmly eating his meal. Balthazar. Hennessey hijacks a food cart -- consumes everything on it yet his skin is getting looser and the body inside gets thinner. He grabs a steak from a woman's plate but she jerks it back so he bites into his arm. She screams as her husband pulls her away. Hennessey's strength is withering away. Desperate, he grabs a FORK, digs it into his own hand. A Hispanic BUSBOY rushes into the room, grabs onto Hennessey. 
JOHN (V.O.) 
But the worst demons are the ones that are allowed to be here -- the ones that are half-human so they blend in... Balthazar stands, throws a few bills on the table and starts toward the back EXIT. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JOHN (V.O.) 
... just like those with the angel's touch living alongside of us. The half-breeds. That Busboy lowers Hennessey to the floor. For a moment we see him framed against the front doorway. And in that instant we get a brief glimpse of -- 
ALTERNATE LOS ANGELES 
An incredible pristine lake reflecting a city of light. 
BACK TO SCENE 
BUSBOY looks up, meets Balthazar's eyes. Bitter enemies. Balthazar grins, flips that coin between his fingers. He leaves out the back exit. 
JOHN (V.O.) 
They call it 'the Balance.' I call it hypocritical bullshit. 
INT. DINER 
JOHN 
So when one of them gets a little cocky, peddles their influence or hijacks a soul -- I deport their scaly ass right back to Hell. (takes a sip of tea) I don't get them all but maybe enough to insure my retirement. 
ANGELA 
Sounds like you're trying to buy your way into Heaven. 
JOHN 
Well, what would you do if you were sentenced to a prison where half the inmates were put there by you? Not a serene image at all.     Angela studies him. 
ANGELA 
Why you? I mean many go to Hell, why were you able to escape? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JOHN 
(sips tea) I don't know. 
ANGELA 
God has a plan for all of us. 
JOHN 
Not for me. John's bitterness is obvious.     Angela just stares at him -- finally -- 
ANGELA 
Isabel saw things too. John looks up. Moment is lost when her CELLULAR RINGS. The cop in her reacts, flips it open. 
ANGELA 
Detective Dodson here. 
EXT. RESTAURANT - LATER 
The morgue is seen across the street.     The Guard that chased Hennessey is just outside. 
WEISS (O.S.) 
Security Guard spotted him near the body, chased him out. We MOVE PAST Angela standing with Weiss.       Around them is a complete shambles of fine dining -- 
WEISS 
He comes over here, makes a run at the entire menu and pow -- deflates like a fricken Macy's day balloon. -- COME TO REST ON John's shattered face. He stares down at Hennessey. Now yards of loose flesh sunken over an assemblage of bones. Only that ragged black tie he wore is familiar now. John leans down to the remains of his friend. A cop starts to intervene but Angela blocks him. Let him be. John has trouble taking this in, reluctantly reaches into Hennessey's coat pocket -- finds the protective amulet he himself removed from his friend. That's even more crushing. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JOHN 
Shit... (sympathetic) Why didn't you call me, you fat sonna bitch... John lowers his head, then spots blood stains on one of Hennessey's hands. He opens the fingers, studies the fork wound. The blood is already drying over it. John reaches over to the mess of dishes on the floor and grabs a melting ice cube. He pushes it into Hennessey's hand, wiping away the dried blood. It quickly becomes apparent -- this isn't random stabbings. This is a shape. John takes a napkin, lays it on the palm and presses. Residual blood creates a symbol onto the napkin. It's the same circular symbol we saw on Isabel's wrist. John doesn't know what it is, but he knows it's important. 
JOHN 
(to Hennessey) Rest in peace, Father. 
INT. 20 LANES - BEHIND THE LANES 
But even a bridge wouldn't help Mammon. Because to cross over, the myth says he'd still need the one thing he could never get. Divine assistance. The help of God. Angela sits back, letting that sink in. 
ANGELA 
So it's impossible. 
JOHN 
Impossible? Sure it's impossible. That's what makes it so dangerous. These things exist to break the rules, to find the loopholes. If the past is any indication, then the future isn't on our side. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
John sits back, gut churning.       Angela's in detective mode. 
ANGELA 
She knew. That's why she killed herself. But it doesn't make sense... 
JOHN 
Makes sense to me. 
ANGELA 
John, she sacrificed herself to beat him. John nods.     Your point? 
ANGELA 
Why is she in Hell? One of those rare moments where John has no answer. 
INT. 20 LANES BOWLING ALLEY 
Something small and SHINY is rolling down the alley.      It lands in the trough, spins round and round -- Beeman leans out to try and see what it is.      The silver object keeps spinning. He waits for it to stop, swats a fly near his face.      Then another. Book on his desk ignites in flame. 
EXT. 20 LANES - NIGHT 
SUV pulls into the empty parking lot. John is out before Angela gets it in park, unlocks the side door. A few flies escape to freedom as he opens the door. John rushes in. 
INT. 20 LANES BOWLING ALLEY 
Only a LOW HUM pervades the dead stillness of the alley. 
JOHN 
Beeman? John grabs the door that leads behind the pin area.      It's locked from the other side. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JOHN 
(pounds on door) Hey, Beeman? Beeman?! The LOW HUM fluctuates -- sounds like a BUZZING. 
ANGELA 
Maybe he's not here. 
JOHN 
He's always here. Several more flies flit by him. This time John notices, turns and spots the source of the HUM -- a cloud of FLIES near the center aisles. Angela follows his gaze, spots them as well. 
ANGELA 
What? John heads across the lanes. Swarm gets thicker and thicker. Angela keeps up with him, covers her mouth. They approach the pin area of the center lane. The source of the swarm is slowly revealed. In the catch trough is a solid mound of flies. John leans closer, spots a HAND protruding from the mound. 
JOHN 
Oh Jesus, no -- He rips his coat off, flings it at the mound and million flies scatter -- revealing the body of Beeman. Ravaged. Flies pouring out of his mouth, his ears -- 
ANGELA 
(stepping back) Oh God -- John goes ballistic, screams to the walls -- 
JOHN 
Who are you?! Answer me!! Goddamit -- reveal yourself!   I summon you! He angrily rips his sleeves up -- revealing two distinct TATTOOS on his forearms. Slams them together with all his might -- clenching his eyes tight -- concentrating -- Veins in his arms and neck bulge, look ready to explode -- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Angela steps back in awe as the air around his outstretched arms begins to WARP -- to tear a faint hole from the bowling alley right into another world right here -- darker -- Hellish -- 
JOHN 
Into the light I command thee!! Into the light I -- John is choked by a cough -- can't finish -- arms separate and he buckles to his knees, reveals to Angela just how ill he really is. She leans down to him, sees hints of blood on the floor. 
JOHN 
... this is my fault... I sent them in... I sent them right to their deaths... a damn one-man plague. 
ANGELA 
John, you need a doctor. 
JOHN 
I've seen a goddamn doctor!! Angela glares at him -- understands now.       He's dying. John stands, almost stumbles.       Angela tries to help. 
JOHN 
Get away from me!! 
JOHN 
Not really, no. 
BALTHAZAR 
You can't cheat it this time... you're going back to Hell. 
JOHN 
True.   But you're not. John removes that small BLACK BOX from his coat. Balthazar tries not to be concerned until John unlatches it and removes the one weapon he hardly ever uses -- A Bible. 
BALTHAZAR 
What are you doing? 
JOHN 
I'm reading you your last rites. Balthazar reacts.      This isn't good. 
BALTHAZAR 
Your remedial incantations have no relevance to my kind. 
JOHN 
Aren't you half human? Balthazar doesn't have to answer. 
JOHN 
You see, that makes you eligible to be forgiven. You do know what it is to truly be forgiven? To be welcomed into the kingdom of God? Balthazar's worst nightmare. 
JOHN 
A demon in heaven -- love to be a fly on that wall... 
BALTHAZAR 
You're not a priest, you have no power... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JOHN 
-- I escaped hell, who else do you know that has the power to do that?! Balthazar is now doubting his own beliefs. 
JOHN 
Just tell me how Mammon is crossing over and you can go back to your shithole. Balthazar isn't convinced. John stands -- raises the Bible and starts to read -- 
JOHN 
'May the merciful God have mercy on you and grant you the pardon of all your sins...' He places a hand on Balthazar's forehead. Balthazar glares at it as John's voice rises with commanding authority. 
JOHN 
'Whosoever sins you remit on earth they are remitted unto them in heaven. I absolve you from -- ' 
BALTHAZAR 
-- It may not even work... 
JOHN 
How?   How's he doing it?! Balthazar looks scared as shit to tell him. 
JOHN 
(bellowing out) 'Grant your child entry into thy kingdom in the name of the Father, and the Son and the Holy Gh -- ' 
BALTHAZAR 
... Sangre de dio. John is stunned -- did he hear right?     Balthazar nods. 
JOHN 
How? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BALTHAZAR 
What killed the Son of God will give birth to the son of the devil. John's mind races and he finally puts it together. 
JOHN 
He's found the Spear. Balthazar's expression confirms it. 
CLOSE ON THE PRISONER'S RELIC 
It's tucked between the folds of an AIRLINES blanket. 
FLIGHT ATTENDANT (V.O.) 
(over com) Ladies and gentlemen, we've been cleared for landing. Please make sure your seats are in their upright and locked position. Hand COMES IN, grips the relic.      WIDEN to see... 
INT. 747 - MID-FLIGHT 
Prisoner in an aisle seat, trying to keep calm. He looks behind him as if being watched. Just nerves again. 
FLIGHT ATTENDANT (V.O.) 
ANGELA 
He's down -- 
JOHN 
He's not down.   Gimme your phone. Angela pulls out her cellular. 
EXT. DOWNTOWN 
A BRITISH COUPLE sit in the back of Chaz's taxi, staring out at the seedy side of town as if it were "Wild Kingdom." 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BRITISH MAN 
They mark their territory with graffiti instead of urine but they're still very much animals. British woman takes documentary photos. Chaz's CELLULAR RINGS over the BUZZ of a dispatch SCANNER. 
CHAZ 
This is a private line -- John?! 
INTERCUT JOHN. 
JOHN 
Chaz -- where are you?! 
CHAZ 
Ah... 3rd and Figueroa. 
JOHN 
You still got that Sedrallus? 
CHAZ 
(glancing to couple) Yeah, but I'm kind of busy right now, John. 
JOHN 
Dammit, Chaz, I'm trying to save my ass here! 
CHAZ 
(under his breath) What else is new... 
JOHN 
Remember the Chalic of Enook incident? 
CHAZ 
(remembering) Oh no, no, no, not that, I just paid off this car! 
JOHN 
West side of the 3rd Street Bridge, say... He checks the speedometer -- 90 mph. 
JOHN 
... 2 minutes. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
CHAZ 
I'm five blocks away! (as John CLICKS off) John? John?! Ah... shit. Chaz downshifts, stops in cloud of dust -- 
CHAZ 
Sorry, tour's over. The British start to argue. 
CHAZ 
OUT YA WANKERS!!! NOW!! 
EXT. LA STREETS - CONTINUOUS ACTION 
John heads toward the skyline now -- at 90 mph -- to the 3rd Street Bridge on the horizon. Angela scans behind them, can't believe her eyes. 
ANGELA 
He's back. Here comes Balthazar through traffic on all fours -- 
ANGELA 
John, he's back and he's gaining! 
JOHN 
Of course he's gaining. John PUNCHES the GAS to the floor. 
EXT. 3RD STREET BRIDGE 
Chaz swerves onto the other side of the narrow bridge. He SCREECHES TO A STOP across the roadway -- opens the glove box, grabs a velvet-wrapped object and pulls a glass vial out of it. Inside flows a phosphorescent green liquid. Chaz jumps out, runs to the back of the car, pauses when he hears the sound of a STRAINING ENGINE. Here comes the topless Barracuda over the bridge's arched roadway. And what the hell is that running behind it? 
CHAZ 
Shit -- shit -- shit -- 
You don't know her. 
MIDNITE 
And you do?   That would be a first. John swings open a STORAGE ROOM DOOR -- looks in at large-scale relics -- statues, props, etc. 
JOHN 
Where's the chair? 
MIDNITE 
The chair? 
JOHN 
The delicate little number from Sing Sing? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Midnite just stares at him. 
MIDNITE 
It's a fine line that separates a hero from a fool. 
JOHN 
I'll take my chances. 
MIDNITE 
And taint my establishment with your blood? I don't think so. 
JOHN 
Midnite -- 
MIDNITE 
You know what that device can do to the ill-equipped -- 
JOHN 
Midnite -- 
MIDNITE 
-- and even in your most glorious days your brain was never your most powerful attribute -- 
JOHN 
Where the hell is the chair, you dumb shit?! Midnite just stands there -- his body inflating past it's seven feet. John knows he went too far. 
JOHN 
That was the cancer talking, you know that, right? 
MIDNITE 
(holds up his finger) Once. John nods. 
INT. STORAGE AREA 
Fluorescents flicker, REVEAL boxes of toilet tissue, cooking supplies, etc. And sitting in one corner by the huge power transformer is -- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
-- the chair. Heavy wooden monstrosity with straps and cuffs and the wear of many who sat in it for the last time. Yeah, it's an electric chair right out of Sing Sing. 
JOHN 
What's in your bathroom, a Renoir? 
MIDNITE 
I have insurance issues. John clears off the seat, starts to sit.        Midnite blocks him. 
MIDNITE 
You haven't surfed in decades. 
JOHN 
Like riding a bike... He tries again.     Midnite blocks him again. 
MIDNITE 
You'll be lucky to reach an elemental plane. 
JOHN 
Then just increase the juice. John tries again.     Again Midnite stops him. 
MIDNITE 
In your condition your body won't take much. 
JOHN 
I just need enough rope to find her. 
INT. MIDNITE'S - STORAGE ROOM 
John's face is held tight in the life-saving fingers of Midnite's grip. John gasps as he comes back -- nods to Midnite and finally -- 
JOHN 
Ravenscar. The abandoned wing. He's in the boy. 
EXT. OVER HILLSIDE - FLYING - EVENING 
WINGED SHADOW glides across the landscape, sweeps across manicured grounds and rises to reveal Ravenscar Hospital. 
INT. MIDNITE'S OFFICE - LATER 
Midnite piles ASSAULT RIFLES, SHOTGUNS, GLOCKS onto a table. 
MIDNITE 
You know these won't kill them. John adjusts the flames of a butane heater under a pan. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MIDNITE 
You probably won't even get close enough to use them. In the pan is that RELIGIOUS RELIC he brought from India. It's now MELTING. Midnite has trouble watching it dissolve. 
MIDNITE 
And it's not just the boy. John coughs, pours the melted gold into several small casting blocks. 
MIDNITE 
You better worry about whoever's helping him. John gives the big guy a glance, dips one of the castings into a pot of water -- HISSSSSS. 
MIDNITE 
As much as I admire your blind faith even in the most dire situations -- expecting to just waltz into a facility that is about to become the floodgate of Hell is reaching a bit, even for you. John stops the work, centers on him and Midnite just knows what he's thinking. Midnite sighs, heavily. 
MIDNITE 
Well I suppose two fools can die just as easily as one. John almost smiles. 
MIDNITE 
Hey, you think I'm trusting you to save the world? John taps the casting and out falls a GOLD-TIPPED BULLET. 
MIDNITE 
But we're going to need more than a few magic bullets to get inside. John centers on the Sparkletts bottles positioned around the room. Just like John's. Hmmmm... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JOHN 
That ritual you do with the water, can you do more than one bottle at a time? Midnite raises an eyebrow. 
EXT. RAVENSCAR - NIGHT 
The motorized MAIN GATE is jammed -- opening and closing on a crashed VAN. The van the Prisoner carjacked. The abandoned hospital wing stands ominous against a moonlit night. Vague figures move about near the emergency entrance. John's BARRACUDA IDLES up with its headlights off. John stares out, points up to the WATER TANK -- on the roof. 
MIDNITE 
(sighs) Figures. 
INT. RAVENSCAR - PHYSICAL THERAPY ROOM 
Therapy machines look like medieval torture devices in the dimly-lit room. BARRY stands waist deep in a large hydrotherapy tank inset into the tile floor. His skin is pale, sickly looking. Obviously containing Mammon takes its toll. Especially on a child. His hands are below his waist and now we see they're lowering a still-unconscious Angela into the water. Her face floats just above the surface as he buckles restraining straps around her wrists. 
INT. RAVENSCAR - ABANDONED WING 
Front glass doors swing open and John and Midnite calmly strut inside. Stop. HEAR the O.S. MURMURS of an unseen crowd. This EMERGENCY ROOM is crammed with people. Lawyers. Brokers. Soccer moms. Truck drivers. Etc... Most are crowded in front of a set of double doors. Room goes dead silent as all eyes lock on our guys. John steps from Midnite, raises his hands like a riot cop. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JOHN 
Okay -- let's cut the scratch and call it a night. Meeting's over. That's got their attention. As entertainment. A few chuckle. John is surprised to see Ellie stepping from the crowd. Still that bundle of sexual energy. 
JOHN 
Ellie? 
ELLIE 
Oh, John, you know how much I love it on this side. This was just an opportunity to make it permanent. 
JOHN 
You think his son will be any different? He'll just turn this place into his own Hell and then where will you to party, Heaven? 
ELLIE 
No need to get nasty. 
JOHN 
Never bothered you before. 
ELLIE 
INTERCUT WITH: 
MYSTERIOUS HIGH POV 
John coughs, struggles to stand. He tries to cover but it's obvious his end is nearing. Midnite positions Angela to face him, braces her arms out from her sides -- crucifixion-style. She tries but can't break free. John puts a hand to her forehead -- 
JOHN 
Et separatur a plasmate tuo, Ut num quam laedatur amorsu antiqui serpentes. 
JOHN/MIDNITE 
Rescind from the flesh I command thee -- Amar natash bow basar! Angela's body stops fighting. The darkness in her eyes and fingernails begins to fade. It's working... Midnite is suddenly JERKED backwards with an agonizing YELL. Angela is dropped, slips into unconsciousness. John watches in horror as Midnite's 300-pound frame is lifted right off the floor by an INVISIBLE GRASP, slammed into the ceiling, then twisted and thrown with incredible force against the floor. Midnite glares at John, tries to speak.     But the words die on his lips. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Enraged, John scans the empty room, sees a large SHADOW on the ceiling that doesn't belong to any object. He holds back a cough long enough to rip up his sleeves and slams those tattoos together -- 
JOHN 
Into the light I command thee! Into the light I command thee! It takes every ounce of John's life force to keep this spell alive and when he's about to drop from exhaustion the shadow is brought fully into the light -- becomes that familiar shape of WINGS. 
VOICE OF MAN (O.S.) 
Your ego is astounding. John strains to see the shadow become the real thing -- the majestic wings of an angel. 
JOHN 
Gabriel? John is too weak to even be surprised anymore. 
JOHN 
Figures... Gabriel touches down in front of him.       Spear in his hand. 
JOHN 
And the wicked shall inherit the Earth. 
GABRIEL 
You presume to judge me, John. 
JOHN 
Betrayal, murder, genocide?    Call me provincial. 
GABRIEL 
I am seeking to inspire humankind to be all that was intended. 
JOHN 
By unleashing Hell on Earth?     Good thinking... Gabriel's wings fold behind as he walks around John. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
GABRIEL 
You've had it too easy for too long. 
JOHN 
So what's a few thousand years of pain, right? 
GABRIEL 
You never deserved to be blessed. You've all been born with a silver spoon in your mouth, never really appreciating the gift you were given so freely -- unconditional love from your creator. 
JOHN 
And that just bugs the shit out of you. 
GABRIEL 
It's not your fault. Like the animals you are, you never learn unless sufficiently prodded. Pleasure has no lasting effect. But subject you to pain, unpleasantness -- suffering -- and you will take notice, you will fight to overcome, to earn your redemption. That is when you're at your best. Angela's fingernails are starting to darken once again. 
JOHN 
You're trying to teach us a lesson? 
GABRIEL 
No, I'm giving you the chance to rise above the suffering and truly earn the love of God. (a beat) The road to salvation begins tonight. Right now. John just stares at this rogue angel, centers on the Spear in his hand. He makes a break for it. Gabriel's wings beat once. The GUST BLOWS John through the double doors, back into the -- 
CORRIDOR 
-- where he smashes against a mesh-screened window, drops to the floor in a heap with the other dying carcasses. 
PHYSICAL THERAPY ROOM 
Gabriel turns back to Angela. He approaches her -- his rippling wings sliding up around her, enveloping her -- pulling her in. Those eyes of his could melt Dracula. 
CORRIDOR - JOHN 
can't even stand, let alone save the girl.     Or humanity. It would be so easy to give up. To roll over and die. But instead, he tries something he hasn't done in a long time. 
JOHN 
(whispering) ... I know I'm not one of your favorites... I'm not even allowed in your house these days... but I could use a little attention... John waits for nothing. His body crumples, his cheek landing flat against the tile. Glistening shards of mirror glass lie around him. As he stares at his reflection in one, he gets the idea. 
PHYSICAL THERAPY ROOM - ANGELA'S EYES 
JOHN 
He has the Spear of Destiny. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Satan didn't know that.     Now he's concerned.     He studies this dying man. 
SATAN 
This is another one of your cons. 
JOHN 
Go look for yourself... Satan is still suspicious. 
JOHN 
You've waited twenty years for me, what's another twenty seconds? Satan contemplates his remark. Metallic reverberation is overtaken as SOUND and MOTION ramp back to real time -- 
PHYSICAL THERAPY ROOM - THE SPEAR 
is about to be thrust into Angela's chest. 
SATAN (O.S.) 
Gabriel? Gabriel looks up -- spots him in the room. Gabriel reacts -- pulls the spear toward her with all his might -- but Satan is faster -- Angela vanishes and Gabriel has now pierced dead air. Satan holds Angela tight -- covering her mouth like John did. She struggles and the demon inside appears -- reflected in the huge chunks of tank glass scattered on the floor. Hideous. The real MAMMON. 
SATAN 
Say goodbye to the sun -- both of you. Mammon SHRIEKS and Gabriel's beautiful wings ignite in 
FLAME -- 
GABRIEL 
No!!!!!!!! 
CORRIDOR - JOHN 
is rocked by a major jolt that shakes the entire building to its foundation. A moment later -- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Satan is back. John looks up, gives him that look -- you owe me. Satan hates admitting it but knows it's true. 
SATAN 
So... what do you want?   An extension? John shakes his head, can barely utter a sound... 
JOHN 
Isabel... 
SATAN 
What about her? 
JOHN 
... let her... go home... 
SATAN 
You would give up your life so she could go to Heaven? John manages a nod... 
SATAN 
Fine. (closes, opens eyes) It's done. 
INT. PHYSICAL THERAPY ROOM 
ANGELA gasps -- her first real breath's a strain. Adrenaline rushes through her and she quickly closes her eyes -- 
EXT. THAT GORGEOUS SKY 
Stretches out BEFORE us. And here come those two swings, penduluming up in SLOW MOTION. Young Angela and Isabel share that moment again. But this time Isabel lets go and jumps out of her swing. Her body sails up and away, her fingers reaching out for what seems so close... so close... Isabel keeps going until she fades into the sky. 
SATAN (V.O.) 
Time to go. 
INT. CORRIDOR 
John relaxes, stops fighting the inevitable. Satan takes his hand, starts to pull him home but suddenly finds himself pulling on what seems to be infinite mass. Try as he might, he can't budge John an inch. And now John's other hand leaves his side, and as if weightless, begins to rise toward something above. No sense in beating around the bush here, John is in the embrace of God. Satan sees this and recoils in absolute RAGE -- 
SATAN 
The sacrifice!! No!!!!   THIS ONE 
BELONGS TO ME!! 
John's rising hand drifts back down in front of Satan, the middle finger fully extended. Final straw. Satan goes rabid -- turns to PURE ENERGY for a split second. His hands remain on fire. 
SATAN 
You will live, John Constantine, you will live so you'll have the chance to prove that your soul truly belongs in Hell. You will live! Satan eagerly plunges his blazing hands into John's body -- John screams in agony. Satan tears through his tissue -- collecting the cancer, then ripping out a mass of diseased tissue with one vengeful pull. John's final blood-curdling SCREAM ECHOES over -- 
INT./EXT. RAVENSCAR 
-- through every room. Every corridor. Rippling out across the ground and finally dissipating in the hills beyond.

FADE IN 
EXT. QUARRY OUTSKIRTS - DAY 1 
A narrow dirt road totally surrounded by thick vegetation. Here and there we see a huge block of stone blocking the road. The sun is shining but it has a hard time making it through the foliage. In the distance we see four guys walking TOWARD the CAMERA. There is a swagger to their walk. MIIï¿½ is singing. The others are humming along. The melody of the song of "0 Bury Me Not On the Lone Prairie" but it's a loose version. 
MIME 
AND WHEN I DIE...WON'T YOU BURY ME 
ON THE"PARKING LOT OF THE A AND P 
BLOW OUT THE CANDLES AND BLOW OUT TIE LAMPS 
AND LIGHT MY PYRE WITH MY TRADING STAMPS 
I HAD TWO BOOKS BUT I NEEDED THREE R 
TO DELIVER ME FROM THE A AND P. 
I HAD THREE BOOKS BUT I NEEDED FOUR 
TO GO TO HEAVEN AND REDEEM MY SOUL. By this time the four are in front of the CAMERA. Mike is handsome and well built. CYRIL is tall and skinny. MOOCHER is very short. DAVE, hanging back a little, is carrying a large trophy. 
DAVE Bravo, Mike! Bravo! Bellisimot 
CYRIL Did you really make all that up? They pass. 
ANOTHER ANGLE The presence of the quarry is felt much stronger now. More and more blocks of cut stone appear. The guys are dwarfed by them. They have to climb over some. 
MIKE I sent away for this stuff from Wyoming. It'll tell you everything. Since you don't believe me maybe you'll believe it when you see it. 
CYRIL And we'd work on the same ranch and sleep in the bunkhouse together, eh? Cont.

MOOCHER That's the whole point. 
CYRIL I always miss the whole point. 
MOOCHER It'd be nice to have a paying Job again, that's for sure. 
DAVE Niente laborare. Niente mangare. 
MIKE What's that mean? 
DAVE You don't work. You don't eat. 
CYRIL That's a terrible thing to say. 
MED. SHOT The quarries are felt even more now. Walls of stone rise up around the guys. 
CYRIL Are you really going to shave your legs? 
DAVE Certo. All the Italians do it. 
MIKE That's some country. The women don't shave theirs. 
CYRIL 
MIKE One for all and all for one. 
MOOCHER There aren't many places, you know, that'll hire all four of 
USE 
CYRIL You know what I'd like to be? 
MIKE Smart. 
CYRIL A cartoon of some kind. Man, X that'd be great. Like when they get hit on their head with a frying pan and their head looks like a frying pan-with a handle and everything. And then they go b-r-r-r. (shakes his head) And their head comes back to normal. That'd be great.. 
MIKE How come you're so stupid, Cyril. 
CYRIL I don't know. I think I have a dumb heredity. What's your excuse, Mike? Mike hits him hard on the arm. Cyril winces. Mike stands up. He makes sure they're all watching and dives in. The guys talk as they follow his progress. 
DAVE You hear from your folks, Moocher? 567 Cont. 
REVISED - "BAMBINO" - 8/12/78 5 1-B Coat. 
MOOCHER .. Yeah, my Dad called. He says there's a lot more jobs in'Chicago. He hasn't got anything yet. Mike has reached the icebox. He opens the door. Goes in. Shuts the door. 
MOOCHER He wanted to know if the house was sold. They could use the money. 
DAVE You can come and live with me when it's sold. In Italy everybody lives together. All three of them are getting concerned about Mike. 
MOOCHER Ever since you won that Italian X bike you've been acting weird. You really think you are Italian. 
CYRIL I .wouldn't mind thinking I was s omebody myself. All three of them stand up. 
MOOCHER Maybe the door is stuck. God dammit! Moocher dives in. Dave and Cyril follow. Moocher swims down to the icebox, forces the door open. They surface. As soon as they hit the surface we hear: 
MIKE ï¿½o.s.} Yoo--hoo . 
THE GUYS' P.O.V. They see Mike standing on top of the rock above them. 
MIKE It's got no back on it! He laughs triumphantly. He's ready to dive in again when he pauses and looks. High above where he stands on the other side of the quarry hole, we see several figures. The guys are swimming toward the rocks and looking at the figures too. 5667 Cont.

MIKE What the hell are they doing here? X 
ANOTHER ANGLE Dave, Moocher and Cyril are standing on the rocks below Mike. Mike is still on top of the rock. High above him are the College Kids. Three guys and three girls. One of the guys is standing on the ledge above the water. Our guys are looking at the College Kid on the ledge. He seems intent on diving into the water. It's a distance of at least eighty feet. He pushes off and dives in executing a beautiful somersault into a swan dive. 
CLOSEUP - OUR GUYS They are stunned. 
CLOSEUP - MIKE He's obviously envious.. He looks from the diver toward the guys and seems to feel his position undermined. 
CYRIL I've never seen anyone dive off from there. 
MIS 
BASTARDS[ 
(CLIMBING DOWN 
THE ROCK) They've got indoor pools and outdoor pools on the campus but they got to come here. (Joins the guys) It's my goddamn quarry. Cyril assumes a very dramatic posture. Sings to the theme from Exodus. 
CYRIL This hole! This quarry hole is mine! 
MIKE Hey, screw you, Cyril. Let's get out of here.

DAVE Buon giornol Buon giornol 
(SPOTS SOME 
SMALL CHILDREN) Hey, bambino. The people and the kids look at him like he's an oddball, but Dave does not notice. A woman is shaking a rug ahead of him, and she looks so Italian that he can't help but smile. A big blonde GIRL is coming out of the house dressed in a waitress outfit. She sees Dave.

PRESIDENT Most of you will only spend four years here but to a lot of us Bloomington is our home and .1 don't like the way you are behaving in my home. These needless hostilities have happened before. They will not happen again. If you feel compelled to compete with the kids from the town then you will do it in a different arena. I am looking at a plan to open our intramural program to them. And as a starting point, in consultation with Mr. Armstrong, we have decided to expand the field of this year's Little 500 to include a team from the town. A loud protest is heard from everybody.

Dave is thrilled at the command. He moves to the front. The following conversations will have to be subtitled.

The 3rd Italian puts on his brakes. Dave puts on his to avoid running into him. As his speed slows down the 2nd Italian sticks his pump into Dave's rear wheel. Dave sees all this. In the split second that it takes, he sees it all. His wheel collapses and Dave tumbles off the road falling down the steep grade. The Italians ride off. The 4th Italian slows down a little to look at Dave. He seems genuinely sorry about what happened but he too continues. He shouts after his teammates. He's a little angry.

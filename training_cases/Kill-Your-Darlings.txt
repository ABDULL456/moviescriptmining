FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 
EXT. RIVERSIDE PARK - NIGHT 
Underwater. 
Shafts of eroded light slice into the depths of the Hudson River. The ghostly melody of "Lili Marlene," the ache of the war-time lover, plays as a strange SHADOW drifts into view. 
We realize it is a BODY. 
ALLEN (V.O.) Some things, once you've loved them, become yours forever. 
The body BREAKS the surface and we see the face of its owner ---- DAVID KAMMERER, 33, bearded, handsome. He is clothed, open white shirt, khakis. Dead. 
ALLEN (V.O.) And if you try to let them go... 
Suddenly, a breath: he comes back to life. 
David floats back to LUCIEN CARR, 20, (blonde, beautiful, shirtless and terrified), waist deep in the water. 
The scene is playing in REVERSE MOTION. 
ALLEN (V.O.) They only circle back and return to you. 
David's body LIFTS into the young man's arms. We see David's feet and hands are TIED together with shoelaces. Stones rise back into his pockets. 
ALLEN (V.O.) They become part of who you are... 
A stain of blood on David's chest shrinks, vanishes. 
David's eyes OPEN. 
CUT TO: 
INT. THE TOMBS - DAY 
LUCIEN ...or they destroy you. 
From behind the bars of a jail cell, Lucien Carr (the young man from the opening) finishes reading from a paper MANUSCRIPT in his hand. 
Lucien, furious, crumples it up. 
LUCIEN You can't show this to anyone. 
We PULL BACK to reveal the author of the manuscript: a eighteen-year-old ALLEN GINSBERG. Unslept and exhausted. But determined. 
Allen stares defiantly at Lucien from the other side of the bars. 
ALLEN Then tell the truth, Lu. 
LUCIEN You weren't even there. It's your truth. It's fiction. 
Allen grabs for his manuscript back, but Lucien pulls it out of reach. 
LUCIEN You wanted him gone too. You sent him to me. 
Allen reaches through the bars and SNATCHES the paper. 
Lucien won't let go -- it's a tug of war between the two boys, two wills. Allen yanks the paper from Lucien's grip and wins. Lucien, panicking. 
LUCIEN (CONT'D) Please. You'll kill me with that. 
Allen turns and races towards the exit of the prison. Desperate, Lucien calls out after him. 
LUCIEN Allen! No! 
Allen doesn't turn. An alarm HAMMERS through the prison. 
NAOMI What did you say? 
Allen turns the music up all the way. Allen mimes deafness. Finally, she understands: their sounds are drowned out by the music. 
Allen reaches for her. She finally softens, takes his hand. 
As mother and son waltz together with the music, Naomi clutches Allen to her, like he's the only thing keeping her sane. Because he is. 
NAOMI Don't ever leave me. 
Allen, trapped, over her shoulder. 
From the doorway, we see that Louis has been watching the whole time. 
EXT. GINSBERG FRONT PORCH - NIGHT 
Overwhelmed, Allen shakes on the front stairs. She's not well. The faint sound of jazz, fun from someone else's home from down the block. Louis comes out onto the porch, with an open LETTER in hand from the mail pile. He's upset. 
LOUIS Were you even going to tell me you applied?! 
Allen spies the "Columbia University" seal on the front. He's been caught. He looks down, ashamed. 
ALLEN I didn't want her to know. (beat) It was a dream anyway. 
Louis lights his own cigarette. Offers his son one. He declines. 
LOUIS (talking to himself, dreaming) Trilling's there. Van Doren. English Professors. Important fellows. And New York City, right in your goddamn lap. 
Louis sits beside his son. 
LOUIS Love that is hoarded, molds at last. 
Allen, surprised to hear his Dad reciting one of his poems. 
LOUIS Until we know, the only thing we have-- 
ALLEN is what we give away. 
LOUIS Is what we hand away. Have, hand. Consonance. 
ALLEN Give, is. Assonance. 
LOUIS I wrote the goddamn poem. Go write your own. 
Louis hands over the letter. The hardest thing he's ever done. 
Allen takes the envelope, rips it open. He's looking at the response in shock. Louis tries to read his son's face. 
ALLEN I got in. 
LOUIS You got in?! 
ALLEN I got into Columbia University! 
LOUIS You got into Columbia University?! 
Allen and his father embrace. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. COLUMBIA QUAD - DAY 
First day of college. Allen crosses the grand Ivy League campus in awe. Before him, the staggering facade of the library like the Parthenon. A troop of Navy midshipmen pass by. Wartime is on. 
INT. ALLEN'S DORM ROOM - DAY 
Allen sets his bag on his bed. He notices on one wall are patriotic posters, exercise posters. He's already got a roommate. 
He eyes a map of the New York City subway system. He can't believe he's really here in the big city. He walks over to it. 
Allen studies the map, his finger gliding down to Greenwich Village. 
LUKE (O.S.) You don't wanna go down there. 
His roommate LUKE, 18, buzz cut, in a sweaty Columbia sweatshirt, leans over him. 
LUKE Land of the fairies. Head there and you never come back. (extending a firm hand) Luke Detweiler, Danville, Virginia. 
ALLEN Allen Ginsberg. 
ALLEN Allen Ginsberg. 
PROFESSOR STEEVES Ginsberg? Your father perhaps is the poet Louis Ginsberg? 
Allen nods. 
PROFESSOR STEEVES He writes rhyming, metered verse. Why do you think he chose that form? 
All eyes on Allen. 
ALLEN Because it's easier. 
The class titters. Professor Steeves hushes them. 
PROFESSOR STEEVES This university exists because of tradition and form. Would you rather this building be built by engineers or Whitman and his boys at play? 
Allen, realizing he is trapped, unable to answer. Professor Steeves smiles victoriously and writes on the blackboard. 
PROFESSOR STEEVES There can be no creation before imitation. 
The other students take note. Allen sighs, follows suit. From the back row, Lucien watches Allen and unsheathes a grin. 
INT. ALLEN'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT 
Luke, dressed in a suit, puts on cologne. He looks back at Allen who is copying from a tome of sonnets. 
LUKE Shut the books. We're taking my brother with us to the social. He ships out tomorrow. 
ALLEN I can't. You see how much I've got to do. 
LUKE He's Navy. It's catnip for the skirts. 
Luke pulls out his own waistband and sprays some cologne down the front. Allen shakes his head. Luke shrugs. 
LUKE You hymies are really all about work, huh? 
Luke slams the door behind. Allen, alone stares out the window. 
A record starts up down the hall. Clarinet, strings. Allen's ears prick up. He knows this tune. 
It's the same BRAHMS from his mother's bedroom. 
INT. DORM HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Allen walks down a darkened hallway, the music leading him forward. He reaches a door with a lit transom. He knocks. 
The unlocked door creaks open. 
INT. LUCIEN CARR'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT 
A mattress lies on the floor, a phonograph on top. Candles light the room. Books for furniture. And Lucien on the floor, reading the Times and smoking. 
ALLEN Brahms? 
Allen walks inside. Lucien looks up, surprised. 
LUCIEN Finally. An oasis in this wasteland. 
Nervous, Allen tries to make conversation. 
ALLEN How come you're not at the social? 
LUCIEN Only the most anti-social have to go to an event actually called one. Libation? 
Lucien rises and grabs a wine bottle corked with a sock. Allen looks nervously towards the door. 
ALLEN You drink in your room?! 
LUCIEN How does a horrible bottle of Chianti sound? 
Lucien inverts two small glasses and pours. Allen stares. He doesn't break the rules. 
ALLEN I don't drink. 
LUCIEN Freshman? 
ALLEN Yes. 
Lucien hands him his glass. 
INT. GINSBERG HOME - NIGHT 
Naomi looks out the window, does not want to answer. 
NAOMI Honey, I need you come home now. 
ALLEN (O.S.) Mom I can't come home. Listen, you have to look after yourself. 
NAOMI I don't feel good. 
INT. DORM HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 
Lucien passes Allen, putting on his coat, heading out to the city. 
ALLEN (whispered, to Lucien) You're going to the dance? 
LUCIEN No. Downtown. 
NAOMI (O.S.) Who are you talking to? Is he there with you?! 
ALLEN No, he's not here with me. 
Lucien quickly waves goodbye to Allen, heads down the staircase. Allen, torn between his mother and this boy. 
ALLEN (into the phone) Listen, I'll come as soon as I can. 
INT. GINSBERG HOME - NIGHT 
Naomi, clutches the phone, deadly serious. 
NAOMI You need to promise. 
INT. DORM HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Lucien slides down the stairway rail. Allen watching him disappear. 
ALLEN Yes. Ipromiseloveyoubye. 
Allen hangs up on his mother and races after Lucien. 
INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT 
Allen, breathless, storms down a flight of stairs, catches up to Lucien. Lucien turns, loving this. The puppy following his new master. 
LUCIEN Coming? 
EXT. COLUMBIA ENTRANCE - NIGHT 
Lucien throws his jacket over Allen's shoulder and leads him into the wild city around the corner. 
LUCIEN Welcome to the edge of the world. 
The sound of the IRT screeching takes us to the SUBWAY MAP from Allen's dorm room which comes to life. 
A RED LINE glides down the map from Columbia University all the way...to Greenwich Village. 
CUT TO: 
INT. STAIRS/APARTMENT, 48 MORTON STREET - NIGHT 
Allen, anxious, follows Lucien up a crowded staircase to a West Village apartment. 
The sounds of a party spill out onto the landing and beyond. It's pure bohemia here. 
Smoke, artists flirting, arguing. Allen sees... 
A black man making out with a white woman. An older, elegant woman sharing a cigarette with a boy half her age. 
She stares seductively at Allen. Lucien enjoying himself immensely. This is what a first time looks like. 
LUCIEN Allen in Wonderland. 
Lucien grabs a DRUNK YOUNG GIRL from the crowd, kisses her passionately. Then lets her go, keeps walking. 
ALLEN Do you know her?! 
LUCIEN No, and I don't plan on it. She tasted like imported sophistication and domestic cigarettes. 
INT. BATHROOM, 48 MORTON APARTMENT - NIGHT 
BILL Play nice, David. 
DAVID Allen, who comes uninvited to my apartment. 
LUCIEN Actually I invited him. 
DAVID None of us notice him. Look at him. Why would we bother? 
In his tucked shirt and creased pants, Allen realizes the entire party is scrutinizing, judging him. 
DAVID So the pattern of our evening, our lives, holds. But under the right circumstances, even he might change the world. 
Jazz music sparks, PRE-LAP from where this party's going next. Lucien eyes Allen -- an idea forming. 
CUT TO: 
INT. TAVERN - NIGHT 
The party continuing at this underground speakeasy. Straight, gay, young, old, a subterranean zoo. A jazz signer owns the room. 
Bill, David, and Allen at a table. David's moment alone with Allen. 
DAVID So you just met Lucien in the lunch line and now he's all that you can see. 
ALLEN Why don't you like me? 
BILL Because David was in the same godforsaken line. 
David and Bill share a knowing look. Lucien returns to the table and slams a glass down. 
LUCIEN Some earjob at the bar just called me "boy." So I stole his drink. 
Allen scans, sees the famous poet OGDEN NASH looking around for his glass. 
ALLEN That's Ogden Nash! 
LUCIEN Who's Ogden Nash? 
ALLEN The best selling poet in the country. 
BILL "A girl who is bespectacled. She may not get her nectacled. But safety pins and bassinets--" 
DAVID "Await the girl who fassinets." 
LUCIEN And that's what he's selling?! I'll kill him. 
Bill takes out a switchblade. 
BILL Aim for the throat. 
A realization. Lucien leans in, focuses his charm. 
LUCIEN No. We're not going to kill him. Even better. We're going make sure nobody remembers him. (turns to Allen) How many men started the Renaissance? 
ALLEN Two. 
LUCIEN And the Romantics. 
DAVID More than I suspect this theory accommodates. 
ALLEN (Five?) 
Lucien's passion building. 
LUCIEN We're sending millions to fight the Fascists in Europe, but they're here! Meter and rhyme--- 
ALLEN And Professor Steeves--- 
LUCIEN Yes! They're all guards in some prison. Let's make the prisoners come out and play. Let's come up with new words, new rhythms. 
Allen, swept up in the energy. He couldn't be more captivated. 
LUCIEN We need a name. 
ALLEN How did they come up "Dada"? 
BILL Tristan Tzara jabbed a knife into a dictionary. 
LUCIEN Shit. So that's been done. 
NAOMI He already signed the papers. 
ALLEN Dad?! 
LOUIS It's for the best. 
ALLEN Your best. 
LOUIS It's for her best. It's not for my best. Look at her! Listen to her! 
Naomi babbling. Allen realizing how far she's gone. Allen shoves the nurse off Naomi. 
ALLEN Get off! 
From deep within, Allen can see she is still there, and we can see she knows that it's too late. 
NAOMI This is your fault. 
The nurse escorts a docile Naomi out of the room. Allen breaks down. Lucien, mute witness to it all. 
MUSIC PLAYS over... 
INT. GINSBERG HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Louis lectures Allen. 
We close in on Allen's despondent face. The dutiful son's first failure. 
EXT. GINSBERG FRONT PORCH - NIGHT 
Allen escapes outside where Lucien is sitting, smoking. Allen sits beside him, notices: Lucien has been crying. 
ALLEN Complicated enough? 
LUCIEN At least you have her. My father left me when I was four. 
A beat of understanding between them. Lucien lays down. Allen takes his cigarette, lays next to him. 
ALLEN I've been thinking about what Yeats said. To be reborn, we have to die first. 
Allen hands him back the smoke. Lucien perks up. 
LUCIEN So what do you suggest? 
INT. LUCIEN CARR'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT 
Candlelight flickers on Allen's face. 
ALLEN I've spent my life making other people happy. 
We PULL BACK to see a noose around Allen's neck. A suicide is underway. 
ALLEN It's time I find happiness the only way I see possible. 
LUCIEN (O.S.) Oh please. Die already. 
We PULL BACK again to see Lucien beside, also with a noose around his neck. Both of them on chairs. Their nooses are attached to the same pipe. 
LUCIEN Where's the verve? The brio?! 
From atop the chair, Lucien kicks his record player with his foot. Grand classical music screeches to a start. 
LUCIEN If it be that I am indulging my self-consciousness in justifying myself, or if it be-- 
ALLEN That's a run-on. 
LUCIEN Don't edit me! 
Lucien shoves Allen. Allen trips off the chair, the noose snaps tight...and suddenly he's hanging in mid-air. He struggles. Lucien tries to help, but falls off his own chair. 
The pipe starts to bend. 
Allen and Lucien panic as they swing through the room, suspended in air. 
The pipe BREAKS. They crash to the ground. 
A beat of relief -- are we alive? -- and the two break out into hysterics. 
DIRTY BE-BOP JAZZ PLAYS OVER... 
Allen looks down at the "New Vision", ashamed. 
INT. LUCIEN CARR'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT 
A rainstorm beating against the windows. Allen paces as a drunk Lucien knocks off a bottle of wine and reads from Allen's journal. 
LUCIEN "The rose that scents the summer air/ grows from my beloved's hair...?" 
ALLEN Keep going. That's my sonnet for Steeves. 
Lucien flips through the journal, closes it, disappointed. 
LUCIEN We have the map. We have the manifesto. We need the work. (suddenly cold) I was wrong. Maybe you're not up for this after all. 
Allen stares at Lucien in disbelief. Shocked, Allen rushes to Lucien's desk. 
ALLEN Show me your fucking map. 
LUCIEN Stop! 
Allen grabs the pages Lucien has been working on: they are covered in doodles - there's nothing there. 
ALLEN Oh right, you don't have anything because David's not here to write it for you! 
Lucien stands up, drunk. Furious. 
LUCIEN It's complicated. 
ALLEN I love complicated. 
Lucien steadies himself. Furious. 
LUCIEN He's a professor working as a janitor so he can be near his precious Lu-Lu. He is a goddamn fruit who won't let me go. 
ALLEN A fruit? 
LUCIEN A queer. 
This detonates inside Allen. Lucien crashes to his bed. Allen sits beside. 
ALLEN Then let's get rid of him. 
Lucien softens, leans against Allen. Passing out from the liquor. 
LUCIEN Right now, I just need you to write us something beautiful. (beat) First thought, best thought. 
Lucien drifts off. Allen shakes, holding Lucien's body for the first time. 
We follow Allen's P.O.V. as he runs his finger through Lucien's hair. He can barely breathe, this close to what he finds beautiful. 
Allen's fingers slide to Lucien's cheek. Toward his lips. 
Lucien's eyes open. Allen tenses, afraid. But Lucien suddenly takes Allen's finger in his mouth. Sucks it, eyeing Allen the whole time. 
CUT TO: 
A thunder-clap. Lucien passed out in Allen's lap. We were just in Allen's imagination. 
INT. ALLEN'S DORM ROOM - DAY 
Allen at his typewriter. A blank page. Inspired to write something beautiful. 
We see flashes of the past, snippets of Lucien: their contact, Lucien's smile. Allen searching through their past. All playing in reverse. 
LUCIEN Allen in Wonderland. 
Is it something? He writes the words down. Flash of their past build in a crescendo as he keeps searching, digging through moments, leading to... 
NOTHING. 
Allen's blocked. 
He'll need more help if he's going to get to beautiful. 
BILL (O.S.) Pervitin. 
INT. BILL'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Bill with NORMAN (30s, shady, real criminal) and Allen in his dim, bookshelf-lined lair. Bill gives the secret nod to Norman. 
A stand-off. David collects his jacket, approaches. 
DAVID Piece of advice. You don't know Lu. As soon you think you do, he'll find someone else. 
David smirks, walks off leaving Allen alone with his pages. 
DAVID Or maybe he already has. 
INT. LUCIEN CARR'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT 
3:00 AM. Allen snoring. Then the sound of the door creaking open. Allen wakes up to see Lucien entering. 
LUCIEN What are you, moving in? 
ALLEN Where have you been?! 
Lucien starts getting undressed. 
LUCIEN I found a real writer. Already a million words under his belt before Columbia. 
ALLEN You mean Jack? 
Lucien fumbles. 
ALLEN Why didn't you tell me? 
LUCIEN What am I supposed to do? Newsreels? 
He spots the piece of paper in Allen's hand. 
LUCIEN What's that? 
Defensive, Allen pockets his poem for Lucien. 
ALLEN Nothing. 
Lucien gets into bed. 
LUCIEN If you're going to stay, don't hog the blanket. 
Lucien closes his eyes. Allen sits up, jealous, his mind spinning. He stares at Lucien. 
ALLEN Why is Jack a real writer? 
LUCIEN Once you meet him, you'll see what I mean. 
JACK (O.S.) Hey Al! 
INT. 118TH STREET APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Handsome JACK KEROUAC (mid-20's, athletic, infamous jaw) palms a football, fakes a pass to Allen. Allen, on the couch with a stack of pages, shakes his head. 
ALLEN No. 
Lucien drinks wine beside. Jack ignores Allen, wings the pigskin right at him. Allen ducks. The ball SLAMS into a painting on the wall. It crashes onto Allen's head. 
EDIE (O.S.) Jack? What was that? 
JACK (with a wink) The damn cat! 
The bell around the neck of Jack's cat KIT KAT jingles as it scurries away. Jack darts over, hangs the painting upside down. 
JACK (whispered to Allen) She painted it. Say nothing. 
Jack notices a piece of mail addressed to him next to Allen. It's an old vinyl RECORD sent by his friend Sammy. He shouts down the hall. 
JACK Hey when'd this come? 
EDIE (O.S.) Today. Where is Sammy now? 
JACK I dunno. Some battleship. 
Lucien nods to the huge manuscript on Allen's lap. We realize it is Jack's novel The Sea Is My Brother. 
LUCIEN What do you think? Brilliant, no? 
ALLEN It's missing some periods and commas. 
LUCIEN It's better than anything you've ever written. 
ALLEN Because I don't want to be the person they think I am. I'm on academic probation. I could be kicked out. You can't leave. You started something and I have no idea what I'm supposed to do next. 
Lucien, moved. 
ALLEN It's our turn. Let's show them what we can do. 
At the thought of payback, Lucien awakens. Allen grins. 
ALLEN You in? 
INT. LIBRARY, MAIN HALL - DAY 
A hard STAMP on a library request: RESTRICTED. 
PERMISSIONS LIBRARIAN You must not drink while you're handling it. And no writing in it. 
Allen, Lucien, Jack and Bill spy on the PERMISSIONS LIBRARIAN and a female PAGE at the main desk. The librarian places a KEY RING in a drawer. 
PERMISSIONS LIBRARIAN It must come back exactly as you found it. 
The Permissions Librarian heads off. Seeing the young page alone, Jack tucks in his shirt, SLICKS his hair down. Jabs a piece of gum from his mouth into Lucien's palm. 
JACK No telling Edie, got it? 
Jack strolls up to the desk. Winks at the page. 
JACK I see you checking out all these books. And I'm asking myself: do you ever get checked out? 
She radiates. Bill looks at his watch. 
BILL 25 seconds. Masterful. 
But then, another page, GWENDOLYN (20, sweet and saucy), joins the first. 
LUCIEN Damn! Shift's over. 
Jack looks back, shrugs as he walks off with the first page. Lucien groans, plan's 86'd. But Allen sits up. 
ALLEN I'll go. 
INT. PERMISSIONS DESK, LIBRARY, MAIN HALL - DAY 
Allen walks up to the desk. 
ALLEN Hi. 
Gwendolyn looks up. Allen is smiling nervously. 
ALLEN I wondered if you could help me. 
GWENDOLYN Sure. 
ALLEN I'm looking for a book. 
GWENDOLYN Okay. Does this book have a title? 
ALLEN It's called The Day Amanda Came. 
GWENDOLYN (knowing look) Well, you'll have to wait. I can't leave the desk. 
Allen turns back to Lucien who nods, eggs him on. 
ALLEN But...I really need it. 
Gwendolyn looks around. 
GWENDOLYN (flirting) Okay. Only for you. 
She places a sign on the desk: "HELPING A READER. BACK IN 5 MINUTES." 
They head off the stacks, Lucien bounds up to the desk, glides over the top, and digs through the drawer. 
Old cards. Broken pencils. NO KEYS. 
LUCIEN Shit! 
60   INT. STACKS - DAY                                           60 
CLOSE UP: THE KEYS in Gwendolyn's hand as Allen and Gwendolyn walk through the stacks. 
Gwendolyn walks off. Allen lifts his pants, ties his belt. 
ALLEN I do. 
EXT. COLUMBIA LIBRARY - NIGHT 
Shots of the darkened church-like building. Deserted. Timeless. 
LUCIEN (O.S.) This is it guys. Our Bastille. No chickening out. 
INT. CARD CATALOGUE AREA, LIBRARY - NIGHT 
The light from the boys' flashlights SLICES through the dark as they enter into the library through a heavy door. 
Bill reaches into Jack's mouth and takes the chewing gum from inside it. Jack shoots a glare at him - what the hell? 
Bill presses the sticky gum into the strike plate of the door -- blocking the door from being able to close shut. 
The boys look at each other, give each other the silent nod, then split -- Lucien and Jack sneak off to the main hall, Bill and Allen up to the stacks. 
Behind them, the chewing gum slips, falls from the strike plate. The door shuts. 
And LOCKS. 
INT. STACKS - NIGHT 
Outside a gated "RESTRICTED ACCESS" room, Bill grabs the padded LOCK and fits in his molded KEY. Allen watches as he turns it... 
The lock CLICKS open. 
INT. LIBRARY, MAIN HALL - NIGHT 
Jack and Lucien unscrew the glass from the VITRINES encasing the historic books and manuscripts we saw earlier. 
EXT. LIBRARY - NIGHT 
Walking into the light of the street lamp outside the library is David. He approaches two campus security GUARDS on the night patrol. 
DAVID Excuse me. I think I saw some light or movement in the library. 
The security guards FLASH their lights at the facade. 
INT. RESTRICTED ACCESS ROOM - NIGHT 
Bill throws open the metal gate between them and the restricted books inside. 
An ALARM explodes into the quiet. 
Bill and Allen look at each other: this was unexpected. 
INT. LIBRARY, MAIN HALL - NIGHT 
Jack and Lucien jolt as the alarm goes off, look up from the vitrines to each other. What is going on up there? 
EXT. LIBRARY - NIGHT 
The guards hear the alarm coming from inside the library. They race to unlock the CHAIN holding the doors locked together. 
INT. RESTRICTED ACCESS ROOM - NIGHT 
Bill rushes past the gate, shines his flashlight searching the books until he finds a box marked RESTRICTED CONTENT. 
He empties it, tossing the books to Allen. We've seen this move before. 
INT. LIBRARY, MAIN HALL - NIGHT 
Allen, carrying the restricted books, runs up to Jack and Lucien at the vitrines which are now wide open and empty. 
JACK (whispered) What just happened? 
Jack and Lucien grab the books from Allen and start to set them in the cases. The alarm suddenly STOPS. 
SECURITY GUARD (O.S.) We know you're here! 
The footsteps of the guards approach. Game over. Their work not done, the boys RACE back to the door they came through. 
All EXCEPT LUCIEN. He ducks behind the vitrine, hiding. He clicks off his flashlight. 
The guards ENTER the main hall, searching for the culprits. 
Allen blocks the library doors with his shoulder. The guards POUND on the door. 
A SOUND from outside: the padlock unlocking. Suddenly: the exit door opens. It's Jack and Bill, with lock-picking gear in hand. 
They YANK Allen and Lucien out. 
EXT. LIBRARY - NIGHT 
Jack slams the door, Bill runs the chain back through the handle and LOCKS it. 
The door BULGES as the guards bang into it. 
SECURITY GUARD Open the goddamn door! Open this up! 
The boys turn and RUN down the grand steps leading back to the campus. Glee on their faces. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. LIBRARY - DAY 
The same grand steps the next morning. Students walking up and down it to class, socializing, as if nothing happened there the night before. 
INT. LIBRARY, MAIN HALL - DAY 
Inside, the pompous TOUR GUIDE from earlier showing off the vitrines to a new crowd of parents and incoming students. 
TOUR GUIDE The South Hall library is a church, and these are the sacraments. 
The crowd mumbles, then laughs. The guide, confused, looks inside them to see the Kama Sutra opened up to a particularly salacious page. 
The explicit images from a Grecian urn. 
Lady Chatterly's Lover, Ulysses, all the books banned, restricted, kept from public eye. 
And lastly: Tropic of Cancer. By Henry Miller. 
The prisoners have come out to play. 
TOUR GUIDE Oh. My. God. 
And a note, left on the glass: "The New Vision." 
INT. WEST END BAR - DAY 
Four shot glasses. Four hands. 
LUCIEN To literacy. 
Allen, Bill, Jack and Lucien throw back their drinks in celebration. 
The Mills Brothers "You Always Hurt The One You Love" on the jukebox plays over this lazy, drunken afternoon. 
Allen's eyes scan the wall above them, Columbia's "Hall of Fame": newspaper headlines, yearbook photos... 
ALLEN Jack, that's you, isn't it? 
He sees a framed photo of Jack in a football play, mid-catch. 
JACK Yep. Last year. They still won. 
LUCIEN Look at them! 
And we do: we see FLASHES of the photos: ribbon-cuttings, team-photos, graduations: life in a thousand fake smiles and stagings. 
LUCIEN Souvenir history. To make people think they left some mark on the world. Because otherwise nobody would ever know. (beat) I don't ever want to end up on this wall. 
JACK Have no fear. You never will. 
Suddenly, David appears in the bar. The group looks at each other, mystified. 
ALLEN What's he doing here? 
David walks briskly over to Lucien. 
DAVID Since you didn't show up earlier, I just hoped to give you this. 
David drops a TERM PAPER on the table: "On the Decline of the West." Allen leans over the table, inserting himself into the conversation. 
ALLEN Maybe he didn't want to see you. 
Jack staggers from out of the barrel. Throws his hands in the air victoriously. Allen and Lucien cheer him on. 
ALLEN No, he lives! 
LUCIEN Excellent! Judges award a... 
Allen holds up nine fingers. 
ALLEN Nine! 
Jack falls to his knees, pukes. Allen and Lucien crack up. 
LUCIEN All right Ginsy, your turn. 
Drunk, Allen tries to stand up. But then falls right back down. Lucien laughs, tucks his body next to Allen's. 
LUCIEN This is just the beginning, you know. 
Lucien lays his head against Allen's shoulder. 
LUCIEN Your fault, Ginsy. It's all your fault. 
Lucien's thigh brushes against Allen's. 
Allen stares at Lucien, in the full glare of Lucien's warmth. 
Allen looks around. The park is empty. Building up the courage. 
ALLEN First thought, best thought. 
He grazes his hand against Lucien's inner thigh. Lucien looks down at Allen's hand curiously, then back at Allen. 
The decisive moment. Allen leans over. Kisses him. It builds in passion. 
Lucien pulls back, unsure. Then returns the kiss. It builds in passion. 
Everything Allen had hoped for, lensed into a moment. 
JACK (O.S.) I think I just puked on the inside. 
Lucien opens his eyes to notice Jack stumbling up the slope. 
He tenses, pulls away from Allen. 
The moment has been shattered. 
As if nothing just happened, Lucien stands and looks at Jack with his usual devilish smile. 
LUCIEN Let's go, Jack. 
He throws his arm around Jack's shoulder, turning his back to Allen. They start to walk off. Jack stops, turns back to Allen. 
JACK Wait, Al, you coming? 
Lucien glares at Allen. 
LUCIEN No. Allen's got work to do. Ten pages on Spengler's Decline of the West. Due tomorrow. 
ALLEN Excuse me? 
LUCIEN I'd be lost without you, Ginsy. (to Jack) Come on, Lion. 
The two of them leave. Allen, abandoned and broken, puts his head in his hands. 
ALLEN Fuck. Fuck! 
INT. 118TH STREET APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Lucien and Jack stumble into Jack's apartment. Edie sits with GRANDMA FRANKIE (90s, stone-faced) around the living room table, listening to the news on the radio. We hear there's been an attack in Anzio. 
JACK Edie! Edie bird! 
Lucien looks at Edie's stone-cold face. She's pissed. He turns right back around. 
LUCIEN (exiting) Lu's going to use the loo. 
EDIE Say hi to Gram. 
Grandma Frankie glares at Jack. 
Allen sits at a table at the library he just broke into and robbed. But now he's just another student sitting at a study desk. 
He puts in a blank page in the typewriter before him and types: "On The Decline of the West. By..." 
He hesitates, breaking down in tears. 
Then finishes typing: "Lucien Carr." 
INT. LUCIEN CARR'S DORM ROOM - DAY 
Lucien, in a Merchant Marine uniform, packs his clothes into a sailor's duffel bag. Allen enters, type-written pages in hand. 
ALLEN Your paper and my apology. 
Allen hands Lucien the paper he wrote for him. But Lucien doesn't take it. Allen registers that he's packing. 
ALLEN Where are you going? 
LUCIEN Sailing out. To Paris. 
Lucien grabs his BOY-SCOUT KNIFE. Puts it in his pocket. Allen is speechless. 
LUCIEN We've got to make a ship, probably as merchant seamen. Jack knows the tricks. 
ALLEN You weren't going to tell me? 
LUCIEN We both know why you can't come. 
Silence. Lucien continues his packing. Allen breaks down. 
ALLEN Fuck you. You're a phony. You got me and Jack and Bill making your vision come true. All because you couldn't do it yourself. 
LUCIEN No, you got what you wanted. You were ordinary, just like every other freshman, and I made your life extraordinary. Go be you now, all by yourself. Leave me alone. 
Allen, now in tears, realizing the end is here. 
ALLEN You don't really mean that. 
LUCIEN (cold, deadened) Allen. Leave. 
Allen gathers himself, stumbles out the door. Leaving the friendship behind. 
Alone, Lucien cracks, breaking down as he closes his suitcase. 
EXT. SEMINARY COURTYARD - DAY 
Allen crosses through the courtyard, heading to class. He comes upon David, waiting for Lucien. Pale. Distraught. 
DAVID Allen, have you seen him? He's not in his room. 
They look almost the same. 
ALLEN He left. 
DAVID I did something wrong. Really wrong. And you have no reason to help me. But 
ALLEN But? 
DAVID I know who you are. We're the ones he needs, but never wants. It hurts, doesn't it? 
Allen burns, does not respond. David is right. 
DAVID All I am asking is tell me where he is. Please. 
CLOSE ON: Allen, on the blade of a choice. 
INT. MERCHANT MARINE, BILLETING OFFICE - EVENING 
Jack and Lucien in a long line of young soldiers waiting to ship out. Lucien nips at a flask. They reach the front of the line. A BILLETING OFFICER calls out to them. 
BILLETING OFFICER Lemme see your papers. 
LUCIEN Two seamen, reporting for duty. 
Jack tries not to laugh, hands over his paperwork. The officer points to Lucien. 
BILLETING OFFICER What's your name? 
LUCIEN Arthur Rimbaud. 
EXT. HARLEM SIDEWALK - DAWN 
Lucien drops the bloody Boy Scout knife down a grate. Jack stands guard. 
LUCIEN (O.S.) I went to Jack first. He told me to get rid of the knife. To forget the whole thing. 
They hear footsteps and turn. A black woman watches them suspiciously. 
INT. BILL'S APARTMENT - DAY 
LUCIEN (O.S.) But then I went to Bill. He told me to get a lawyer. 
Bill fingering David's pack of Lucky Strikes in his bathroom. David's blood on his hand. 
LUCIEN (O.S.) To say it was an act of self- defense. 
Lucien watches Bill light one of the bloody cigarettes and inhale. The last flare of his friend. 
Bill flushes the rest of the pack down the toilet. 
CUT BACK TO: 
INT. TOMBS - DAY 
Lucien, desperate, at the bars of his cell. 
LUCIEN The D.A. is asking for my deposition. In writing. 
Allen shakes his head, there's no way he's going to do this. 
LUCIEN (pleading) We both know I can't do it. I don't know what I'm going to do. I'm going to be stuck in here for the rest of my life! 
Allen, still unsure. Lucien slides his hand down the bars until it touches Allen's. Pleads seductively. 
LUCIEN Please don't leave me here. 
The BUZZER goes off. Visiting time is over. The prison guard heads towards the cell. Allen makes a fateful choice. 
ALLEN I'll do it. 
Lucien, smiling. Leans in, whispers. 
LUCIEN We're going to say it was an "honor slaying". 
Off Allen's confused face... 
INT. LIBRARY, MAIN HALL - DAY 
A finger traces down a legal index to the definition of the phrase: "Honor Slaying." 
ALLEN (V.O.) "Related to a lethal attack committed when the accused is defending himself against a known homosexual." 
OTHER students around Allen gossip and steal glances at him as he reads to himself from the index. The murderer's "friend." 
ALLEN (V.O.) "If the accused is heterosexual, he shall be pardoned. But if the accused is homosexual, the charge of murder in the first degree..." 
Allen's attention falls to the final words: 
"SHALL STAND." 
INT. POLICE OFFICE - DAY 
Jack, in handcuffs, on the phone. PHOTOGRAPHERS, JOURNALISTS outside, clamoring for Jack to look their way. A murder with Columbia University students, this is big news. 
JACK Dad. It's five thousand dollars for bail. I know it's a lot-- 
A flash bulb FIRES. Journalists cat-calling for Jack's attention. 
JACK'S FATHER (O.S.) No Kerouac was ever wrapped up in a murder! Go to hell. 
The line goes dead. Jack has run out of options. More flashbulbs EXPLODE. More screaming for his attention. Jack whips around. 
JACK Would you all just SHUT THE HELL UP?! 
INT. LUCIEN CARR'S DORM ROOM - DAY 
Marion Carr taking down Lucien's dorm room, packing her son's belongings into the same suitcase he tried to run away with before. 
MARION CARR You must understand David has been following him for years. 
BILL (O.S.) He put stones in his pockets to weigh him down. 
Lucien panics, looks around. He takes off his Merchant Marine clothes. Fully naked, he drags a bound David into the dark waters of the Hudson River. 
David moans and struggles but is no match for Lucien. 
BILL (O.S.) And dragged him into the Hudson River. 
ALLEN (O.S.) What?! 
BILL (O.S.) David was alive, Allen, until Lucien made him drown. 
The sound of a door slamming open brings us... 
BACK TO SCENE 
INT. BILL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
MR. BURROUGHS (60s, patrician, wealthy), Bill's father enters his son's apartment, causing Bill to stop telling the story. Mr. Burroughs eyes Allen suspiciously. 
MR. BURROUGHS Who are you? Is he part of this business. 
BILL Leave him alone, Dad. 
MR. BURROUGHS I paid your bail. Don't talk to me like that. 
Bill looks down, obedient. The rebel silenced by his father. 
BILL Yes, sir. 
MR. BURROUGHS The car leaves in five minutes. 
As Mr. Burroughs exits, Bill furiously SLAMS his suitcase closed. 
BILL The libertine circle has come to an end. 
Allen looks at Bill, lost at what to do next. Bill leans in close. 
BILL Go back to the beginning. 
THE RED LINE LEADS US, ONCE MORE, DOWN THE SUBWAY MAP FROM COLUMBIA... 
TO THE EDGE OF THE WORLD. WHERE IT ALL STARTED. 
INT. BATHROOM, DAVID'S APARTMENT (48 MORTON) - DAY 
The window bangs open. Allen climbs into David's apartment from the fire-escape. 
He opens the door to the living room. Sunlight filtering into a dusty, silent apartment. 
INT. DAVID'S APARTMENT (48 MORTON) - DAY 
It is eerie. The place of someone who just left the world. Allen looks around, unsure what he's looking for. 
His eyes fall on the bookshelves. Memories flood back, raveling and unraveling. 
FLASHCUT TO: 
INT. DAVID'S APARTMENT (48 MORTON) - DAY 
Books LEAP into Bill's hands and he places them back on the shelves. 
Allen UNSUTURES the pages of books, returning back to their original condition. 
Lucien TAP nails out of the wall handing the pages back to Allen. 
Allen scouring his memories, just like when he wrote his poem earlier. 
Time runs in reverse. 
BACK TO SCENE 
INT. DAVID'S APARTMENT (48 MORTON) - DAY 
Allen searches through the steamer trunk of the apartment. Nothing. He ruffles through the console table. Again nothing. 
He notices David's SUITCASE. The one David packed before planning on leaving by boat with Lucien. 
Allen opens it. He digs through it, searching for some clue, any clue -- something to shed light on the past. 
NAOMI But you're not. 
Allen, a kid out of his league. 
ALLEN I'm in over my head. Someone I know killed a man. And I don't know what to do. He wants my help. And I don't know if I should give it to him. I don't know if it's right. It's just a mess. 
NAOMI Let him go. Don't help him. 
ALLEN I can't, mom. He's my best friend. 
NAOMI Listen to me. 
Naomi pulls her son closer. With more strength than she has displayed in years. 
NAOMI The most important thing your father ever did was fail me. (beat) You understand? 
Allen, realizing what he has to do. 
INT. DORMROOM - NIGHT 
Late night. Allen, back at the typewriter where he wrote the poem for Lucien. 
He inserts a blank page. The task before him feels huge. 
The events of the night in question -- the night of David's murder -- ravels and unravels in his mind's eye. 
FLASHCUT TO: 
David, stabbed, gasping at Lucien with horror. The knife being pulled back, the wound closing back up. 
FLASHCUT TO: 
David, reaching for Lucien, in reverse, Lucien walking back to David, ending in an embrace. 
ALLEN (V.O.) He loved you. And the truth is, once-- 
FLASHCUT TO: 
Allen turns over the old PHOTOGRAPH of David and Lucien together from David's apartment. The Perfect Day. 
ALLEN (V.O.) You loved him back. 
FLASHCUT TO: 
EXT. RIVERSIDE PARK - NIGHT (FLASHBACK) 
Time now runs forward, to the inevitable. We watch Lucien and David walking once more of the night of the murder. But this time we hear their argument. Lucien, drunk, tosses his flask into the bushes. David follows him, desperate. 
DAVID Let's get out of the city. Anywhere you want. I've saved up. 
ALLEN (V.O.) But this secret ate away at you. 
LUCIEN I was just a kid, you dragged me into your perverted mess! 
ALLEN (V.O.) So in Chicago, you tried to kill yourself. 
DAVID How can you say that? You know that's not true. 
Lucien stops short. Stares hard at David. 
DAVID I will never give up on us. 
ALLEN (V.O.) He rescued you. He saved your life. 
LUCIEN You're pathetic. 
Lucien walks on, but David lunges for him. They struggle. 
Lucien throws David off, spins free from his grasp, pulls out his Boy Scout knife from his pocket. 
The two men face each other. 
ALLEN (V.O.) You needed him as much as he needed you. 
The bare blade FLASHES between them. David, looking at the knife, shocked that their relationship has come to this. He looks back up at Lucien. 
DAVID Now I know how you felt. 
LUCIEN When? 
SECRETARY He'll be with you in a minute. Please, have a seat. 
Allen waits, glances at the deposition in his lap. The title reads, "The Night in Question." 
INT. JAIL - DAY 
From his prison bed, Lucien stares down the cellblock, hopeless. His eyes alight on his sheets. 
INT. DISTRICT'S ATTORNEY'S OFFICE - DAY 
The camera moves in an arc, rotating past Allen, sweating, toward the door of the DISTRICT ATTORNEY... 
INT. JAIL - DAY 
...the same circle finds Lucien as he RIPS the bedsheet into strips. Frantic... 
INT. DISTRICT'S ATTORNEY'S OFFICE - DAY 
The circle discovers Allen, unable to sit still. The weight of his decision crushes him... 
INT. JAIL - DAY 
...Lucien fashions a noose around his neck. He ties the sheet to one of the cell bars. We glide past him back to... 
INT. DISTRICT'S ATTORNEY'S OFFICE - DAY 
...Allen spies the shadow of the District Attorney behind frosted glass of his office... 
INT. JAIL - DAY 
...the circling suddenly STOPS at Lucien as the knot on the noose catches. He is hanging, choking, desperate to die and yet fighting for life. 
But the knot on the cell bars releases. Lucien FALLS to the ground. 
Alive. 
INT. DISTRICT'S ATTORNEY'S OFFICE - DAY 
The secretary hangs up the phone. 
SECRETARY Mr. Ginsberg. He's ready for you. 
She looks at the chair. No one is there. 
SECRETARY Mr. Ginsberg? 
The sound of the door closing. Allen is gone. 
MALE VOICE (O.S.) How did you expect us to react to this? 
INT. COLUMBIA DEAN'S OFFICE - DAY 
Allen's manuscript HITS the Dean's desk. 
The deposition's title page now reads "The Night in Question by Allen Ginsberg." It's been refashioned into a novella. 
Allen sits in the same chair where Lucien was reprimanded. Professor Steeves sits silently beside the Dean at his desk. 
DEAN No, please tell me. Professor Steeves says you submitted it as your final. 
Allen, nervous in the chair. 
DEAN Well, then, let me tell you. It is smutty and absurd. 
ALLEN But you finished it. 
The Dean loses his patience. 
DEAN You've taken incompletes in two classes. And you are already on academic probation. There are rules you agreed to upon admittance into this university. And you have managed to break and keep breaking them. You don't seem to have much respect for this institution. So you may either retract this fiction as your final. Or you may choose to be expelled. What will it be? 
Professor Steeves eyes Allen. 
ALLEN Fine. 
Allen stands, making his decision. 
ALLEN Consider me expelled. 
Allen reaches for his manuscript. The Dean SLIDES it out of reach.

1   INT. KPHX TV - LOBBY - DAY                                      1 
ABBY RICHTER, 30's, pretty, driven and absolutely in control, walks through the lobby, greeting the SECURITY GUARD. 
ABBY Morning, Freddy. 
SECURITY GUARD Morning, Abby. Another peaceful day? 
ABBY If you say so... 
2   INT. KPHX - CORRIDOR - MORNING - MOMENTS LATER                  2 
JOY, 40's, the associate producer, falls in step with Abby. 
JOY (panicked) We've got problems. 
ABBY There are no problems, Joy.   Only solutions. 
JOY The sky-cam on the traffic copter has a cracked lens and they can't fix it. 
ABBY Okay, that's a problem. (thinking, then...) Call Matt Hardwick down at Media Services. He's got a few Sky Cams and he owes me. Now, where are my weathermen? 
Joy opens a door to a waiting area. 
3   INT. KPHX - WAITING AREA - MORNING - CONTINUOUS                 3 
Several portly LATINO MEN look up and wave at Abby. 
LATINO MEN Hey there! 
ABBY Hi, guys! 
Abby waves back and closes the door.

ABBY What's with the pot bellies? 
JOY Research shows people like fat weathermen. It makes them feel safe. 
ABBY I like the one in the green and the one in the brown, but I want to see the one in the green with less sideburns and the one in the brown with more, then I'll make my decision. 
LARRY (O.S.) Abby! 
LARRY, 50's, the pompous, uptight anchor man, catches up to them. He wears a makeup bib. 
ABBY Morning, Larry. 
LARRY I'm sorry to do this to you, Abby, but I don't think I can work with her anymore. It's bad enough I have to take her criticism at home. I can't do it on air, too. A man can only take so much. 
Abby nods, taking him seriously, but you can tell she's done this before. 
ABBY You're not a man, Larry... (off his look) You're a newsman. A newsman isn't defined by the easy times, Larry, he's defined by the difficult ones. Can you imagine Ted Koppel or Chris Hansen or Anderson Cooper having their wives as co-anchor? Hell, no, because they couldn't handle it. But you can. You've got balls the size of Volkswagens. Don't think I haven't noticed.

LARRY (re his balls) I've only thought of them as blue as of late, but you're right. They are quite sizeable. But not disproportionately so. (with pride) I like to think of them as aesthetically pleasing -- 
Abby steps away, not wanting to ponder Larry's balls anymore than she has to. 
ABBY I think I've made my point. 
Larry nods, appeased, as she reaches the door marked ABBY RICHTER, PRODUCER, "ALBUQUERQUE A.M." She enters and... 
4   INT. KPHX - ABBY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS                                4 
...walks in on a shouting match between JOSH, a leftist angry news writer, and DORI, the entertainment-leaning co-writer. 
DORI Josh, nobody in Sacramento gives a                              * crap about trees in Alaska! It's not newsworthy. 
JOSH Oh, but full coverage on David Beckham's new tattoo is vital?! 
Larry's wife and co-anchor, GEORGIA, 40 and coiffed to the gills, storms in, followed by the show's GUEST CHEF. 
GEORGIA He's trying to kill me! He knows I can't eat crab, I'm allergic to it! (to the room) Does anyone see this? Is this a hive? 
JOSH It looks like syphilis to me. 
DORI (to Josh) See that? You wouldn't even know what syphilis looks like if it weren't for my story on Paris Hilton. 
JOSH Who the hell is this guy?

STUART His name is Mike Alexander. 
ABBY And he's a    quintessential misogynist    uber-moron who represents    everything wrong with television    and society at large... 
DORI I get crap every time I suggest we do something even remotely fluffy and now you're gonna put this douchebag on the air? 
STUART He's got a point of view. We don't have to like him, we're news people. We're objective. Stone Phillips interviews terrorists, doesn't mean he likes them. It's good for ratings. 
Abby holds up a piece of paper. 
ABBY I've got a whole list of ideas on how to improve ratings. We don't need him. 
Stuart takes the memo, reading it. 
STUART A live debate on immigration policy? Never work. 
ABBY What are you talking about? Albuquerque is 45% Latino. 
At this moment, MIKE walks in. Abby stares at him, appalled. 
MIKE Yeah, and as you can tell by all the screaming rugrats in this town, Latino guys like to have a lot of sex. Which means they'd rather listen to me tell them how to bang hot chicks than hear about why they can't bring grandma across the border. (as they all stare at him) (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008 22   CONTINUED: (3)                                                    22 MIKE (cont'd) Sorry, I was eavesdropping out in the hall. 
STUART See, what did I tell you? He's great. 
MIKE Thanks, boss. 
Abby spins to face Stuart. 
ABBY You already hired him?! 
MIKE (re Abby) Who's this delightful creature? 
ABBY Your superior. 
MIKE Mmm...I like a woman on top. 
23   INT. ABBY'S OFFICE - DAY - MOMENTS LATER                          23 
Abby is pacing, clearly on the verge of hysteria. 
ABBY (chanting) I am an award-winning news producer. I am an award-winning news producer... 
A KNOCK. Then the door opens and Mike appears. 
MIKE Hey, no hard feelings, right? 
ABBY You don't even knock? 
MIKE I knocked. I got no response. 
ABBY So, essentially your knock was negated by your complete lack of adherence to the social etiquette of what follows a knock. 
(CONTINUED) 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008 23   CONTINUED:                                                        23 
MIKE Wow. You are wound like a fuckin' top. 
Abby glares at him. 
ABBY Woof woof.     Recognize the bark? 
He stares at her, surprised. 
MIKE (then; realizing) Hey, what do you know? You're not ugly at all. 
ABBY Imagine my relief. 
MIKE You know, if it weren't for you, I would have never gotten this gig. You and I make good TV. 
ABBY I'm sorry, what channel is your show on? 
MIKE Eighty three. 
ABBY This is channel two. You do know that the lower numbers are better, right? More people watch. So don't tell me that "you and I" make good TV. I am an award-winning news producer. I make good TV. You make imbecilic trash watched by housebound inbreds who are so busy putting their hands down their pants they're unable to change the channel. 
MIKE I hadn't really been picturing you that way, but thanks for the image. 
ABBY Let me tell you something. I am not one of your viewers. My cat stepped on the remote. 
(CONTINUED) 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008 23   CONTINUED: (2)                                                    23 
MIKE Thank your pussy for me, then. 
Abby gags as she pushes past him and walks out. 
24   INT. KPHX - HALLWAY - DAY                                         24 
LARRY That's not my fault! 
MIKE I know, it's her fault! 
GEORGIA Why is it my fault?! 
In the control room, Abby looks like she's going to pass out. 
ABBY Oh, dear God. 
GEORGIA Well, what am I supposed to do, give up the money, so he can get an erection? 
MIKE I agree. You've economically emasculated your husband to such a point that he's afraid to desire you. Sure, you can dump his ass, but honey, have you seen the eligible men in Albuquerque? It's slim pickings out there for a woman in her forties. You're not going to do any better than Larry. You just have to let him be a man. LET HIM BE A MAN, GEORGIA! (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008 26   CONTINUED: (3)                                                    26 MIKE (cont'd) (to Larry) And you, Frowny McFlacid, give it to her. Now! 
Larry grabs Georgia and kisses her hard. After a moment of resistance, she melts into his arms. The crew goes crazy. Larry throws Georgia over his back and hauls her off the set. 
Abby sinks down into a chair.                                          * 
CLIFF And we're out. 
He cuts to BLACK. 
27   INT. KPHX - ABBY'S OFFICE - DAY                                   27 
It's pitch black. Suddenly a closet door is opened. Joy and Stuart stand in the doorway. 
JOY Found her. 
Abby is sitting in a ball in her closet. 
STUART One thousand, one hundred and forty- seven calls and over three hundred E-mails. And fifty-three percent of them were women. This guy's a lightening rod! 
ABBY (confused) People liked him?! 
STUART Liked him? They loved him. 
ABBY How is that possible? 
STUART I don't know, but I'm scaling back the news and giving it to "The Ugly Truth." Corporate wants five minutes of Mike Alexander, five days a week. 
ABBY Stuart, I really think this is a mistake -- 
(CONTINUED) 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008 27   CONTINUED:                                                          27 
STUART Just keep him happy and both of our contracts will be renewed. 
Stuart leaves. Joy turns back to Abby. 
JOY Congratulations? 
Abby closes the closet door on herself. 
28   INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY- DAY                              28 * 
Mike enters his apartment, throws his keys on the counter and hits play on his answering machine. 
GIRL'S VOICE (V.O.) Hey, Mike, it's Valerie. I haven't heard from you in a while. But I just saw you on TV. You were great! 
He pushes skip. 
2ND GIRL'S VOICE (V.O.) Mike, hi, it's Ginevra, I'm having a party -- 
Skip. 
3RD GIRL'S VOICE (V.O.) Why haven't you called me? I miss you. It's Laura, by the way. Remember? We went to the track? 
MIKE Remember? How could I forget? You threw up in my car. 
JONAH, 14, awkward, Mike's nephew, walks in. 
JONAH Dude, you totally hosed me! 
MIKE What? 
JONAH Last week on your show, you said you should always be mean to hot girls because they'll want you more. I tried it today, she cried, and then I got detention. 
(CONTINUED) 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008 28   CONTINUED:                                                        28 
MIKE First of all - don't listen to what I say on my show. Second of all, you're supposed to do that to 25- year-old girls who think they're hot and can get any guy they want. Not 14-year-old girls. They're going through puberty. They have enough problems. 
JONAH Mom said when she was fourteen, she was the prettiest girl in the class. 
MIKE Well, I was there when she was fourteen and let me tell you something -- she lied. 
Mike's sister, ELIZABETH, 40's, walks in, wearing a nurse's uniform and holding a cake box. 
ELIZABETH Don't listen to your Uncle Mike, he was blind from masturbating too much. 
MIKE Oh, that's a nice thing to tell your son -- 
He picks up a copy of "Ulysses" from the table. 
(CONTINUED) 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008 30   CONTINUED: (2)                                                    30 
MIKE (CONT'D) Now, if you'll follow me we have something quite different... 
He starts to walk off the set. 
31   INT. KPHX - CONTROL ROOM - DAY - SAME TIME                        31 
Now in the control room, Abby panics. 
CLIFF                                              * Where the hell is he going?! 
ABBY                                               * Follow him! 
32   EXT. KPHX - ALLEY - DAY - CONTINUOUS                              32 
...Mike exits the stage door and walks into the alley, followed by the confused camera crew. 
MIKE Ah, I see you ladies have started without me. 
He smiles at TWO BLONDE TWINS IN BIKINIS, who wrestle in a kiddie pool of Jello. 
We INTERCUT with the control room. 
ABBY Who let them on the lot? Don't we have security? 
IN THE ALLEY, a security guard watches the girls, smitten. 
Mike smiles to the camera. 
MIKE Babes wrestling in Jello. Let's just take a quick survey and see which option the men out there would pick. 
ABBY Do we have phone lines?      Open them!                      * 
MIKE Beethoven, stuffed pheasant and                              * James Joyce -- or semi-naked chicks frolicking in strawberry-flavored goo. 
(CONTINUED) 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008 32   CONTINUED:                                                        32 
As Abby looks horrified, the PHONES in the control room start RINGING off the hook. Realizing her defeat, Abby sighs. 
ABBY Jesus, if we're gonna do this, we might as well milk it. (then; into headset) Two, go wide! Good. Ready, one -- tight on his hand! 
Abby grabs the microphone for Mike's ear piece... 
ABBY Lick the Jello off her finger! 
ON THE MONITOR -- A slightly puzzled look from Mike, but he lifts the girl's finger and licks the Jello off it. 
ABBY (COMT'D) (into headset) Go one! 
The camera focuses tightly on his face. 
MIKE Mmmm...I was wrong. It's cherry. And that's the ugly truth. Over to you, Georgia. 
As Mike waves to camera, he's pulled into the Jello pool and the girls rip off his shirt. 
33   INT. KPHX "SACRAMENTO AM" - DAY                                   33 * 
Mike walks in, covered in Jello, to find Abby standing there, arms crossed, quietly containing her rage. 
ABBY Your realize I once had the Archbishop Desmond Tutu on this show. 
MIKE Who's that? 
Abby rubs her temples. 
ABBY I can't even illustrate how far I've fallen, because you're not smart enough to get the references. 
She walks off. Confused by her reaction, he follows. 
(CONTINUED) 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008 33   CONTINUED:                                                        33 
MIKE C'mon, we were a good team back there. You were the one who told me to lick the Jello. 
ABBY Do you have any idea how much I hate myself for that?! It was cheap titillation. I am now going to broadcasting hell right behind Geraldo and the naked weather girl from Canada. 
MIKE Seriously? There's a naked weather girl? Can we get her? 
34   INT. KPHX - "SACRAMENTO AM" SET - DAY                             34 * 
CLOSE ON Stuart, wearing a grave expression.                           * 
STUART                                          * (into camera)                                         * You've got to do it for ratings,                          * Abby. We have no choice.                                  * 
Abby nods, uncomfortable. We PULL BACK to REVEAL that she's            * now the NAKED WEATHER GIRL, sitting behind the anchor desk.            * Strategically placed cardboard suns and clouds cover her               * bosom.                                                                 * 
Traumatized, she reads off the teleprompter.                           * 
ABBY                                            * "Today, it will be partly                                 * sunny...with a cloud cover moving                         * in from my left breast..."                                * 
Colin CATCHES her. But only for a moment. 
She DROPS out of his arms and onto the ground. As she goes, his TOWEL GOES WITH HER. Landing on her face. 
COLIN Whoops. 
She pulls the towel away and looks up, trying not to make eye contact with the one-eyed trouser snake staring back at her. 
ABBY Hi, I'm Abby. 
38   INT. MIKE'S APARTMENT    - DAY                                     38 
Mike plays poker with his     buddies: DWAYNE (30's, chubby), STEVE (30's, Latino), and     GARY(30's, bespectacled). While Mike tries to concentrate     on the game, but the guys are more interested in reading his     fan mail. 
DWAYNE (reading) "Dear Mike, I know I'm the girl who can change you and make you fall in love. Here's a photo of me and my iguana." 
Steve looks at the photo. 
STEVE I thought iguanas only liked dry places. 
He passes it to Gary. 
GARY We might need to call animal control on this one. 
MIKE Guys, enough with the fan mail. 
STEVE What? You don't want to add her into your rotation?

MIKE Uh, no. 
DWAYNE What about the tranny? He seemed nice. 
GARY And he went to all the trouble to knit you that cock-sock. 
Mike rolls his eyes and deals the cards. 
MIKE Can we just play poker? 
39   INT. COLIN'S CONDO - NIGHT                                        39 
Unpacked boxes are stacked everywhere. Classical music plays on the stereo. Colin, now in sweats and a t-shirt, examines Abby's ankle. 
ABBY (impressed) You're a doctor? 
COLIN An orthopedic surgeon. 
She glances around the room and sees a bottle of red wine and a half empty wine glass sitting on a table. 
COLIN I do a lot of leg and hip stuff but I do get the occasional foot. You seem to be fine. No sprain. 
ABBY Well, I guess I'm pretty lucky D'Artagnan picked your tree to climb. Dave in the next unit over sells lawn furniture. I don't know that I would have been as confident with his diagnosis. 
COLIN I'm here whenever you need me. 
Abby puts on her shoes as Colin opens his wallet and hands her a card. 
(CONTINUED) 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008 39   CONTINUED:                                                     39 
COLIN (CONT'D) My home number's on the back. If the ankle starts giving you problems, just give me a call. 
Colin picks up the cat, who starts purring. 
ABBY Wow, he doesn't usually like men. 
COLIN Dogs are great, but...well, you're a cat person. You know. 
Abby looks at him, nodding. Delighted at his complete and utter perfection. 
ABBY Well, I guess I should get going now. 
She remains rooted to her spot. He waits a beat then, feeling awkward, makes a move to open the door. 
ABBY (CONT'D) Thanks again for saving me. 
COLIN Any time. 
She walks out and Colin closes the door. Realizing that he still has the cat in his arms, he opens the door to find -- 
Abby doing a SPAZZY HAPPY DANCE. Startled, she quickly composes herself. 
COLIN (CONT'D) You forgot your cat. 
ABBY (re the dance) Oh. Thanks. There was a -- spider. On me. But it's gone now. 
He chuckles, hands her D'Artagnan. 
COLIN Good night. 
He closes the door. 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008 
MIKE I really hope he's real this time, because otherwise this is just sad. 
ABBY Oh, he's very real. Not to mention stunningly handsome and morally sound. His name's Colin. (MORE)

MIKE You know what that means? 
ABBY What? 
MIKE He had to stick his finger up some guy's butt in medical school. 
ABBY You disgust me. 
44   INT. ABBY'S OFFICE - DAY - CONTINUOUS                             44 
Abby enters her office. Mike follows her. 
MIKE So, did butt-boy ask you out? 
ABBY Not exactly. We're taking things slow -- getting to know each other first. (then) Why am I talking about this with you? 
MIKE You're the one who brought it up. 
ABBY Dr. Anderson is everything that you could never be. In fact.... 
Abby takes Colin's card from her wallet, dials a number, then -- 
ABBY (CONT'D) (into phone) Hi, this is Abby Richter calling for Dr. Anderson. Yes, I'll hold. 
MIKE You're calling the guy?! You can't do that. You've gotta let him call you.

Abby shoots Mike a snide grin. 
ABBY (CONT'D) Hi Colin. This is Abby. Your neighbor. From last night. 
45   INT. COLIN'S OFFICE - DAY                                         45 
Colin, in a white doctor's jacket, talks on the phone while going over patient files. 
COLIN Oh, hi. Everything okay? 
We INTERCUT. 
ABBY Couldn't be better. I just wanted to call and tell you how much I enjoyed meeting you. 
Mike picks up the extension and listens in. Abby glares at him, but she can't stop him. 
COLIN Oh, thanks. 
ABBY So... I was just thinking that we should have dinner. 
COLIN (not great) Oh... great. 
Mike shakes his head, knowing where this is going. 
ABBY There's this new French Bistro that got fantastic reviews and there's a gallery opening in Old Town on Friday. So, if you want, we could have dinner, then go to the opening. 
COLIN Hmmm, Friday... wow.

ABBY Is that not a good time? 
COLIN Actually, Abby, I'm still kind of unsettled with the move and everything so I`m really not -- 
Mike snatches the phone from Abby and hangs it up. 
ABBY What the hell are you doing? 
MIKE Saving you. He was blowing you off. 
ABBY He was not. 
She moves to pick up the phone. Mike sits on the phone to stop her. 
MIKE Don't! He'll be expecting you to call him back. When you don't, he'll call you. 
ABBY How do you know? 
MIKE Because I know men. If you want it to work out with this guy, you'll listen to me and do exactly as I say. You already did irreparable damage with your psycho-aggressive control freak phone call. It might even be too late. Even if you do salvage the situation, you'll probably never be more than Abby, his desperate neighbor. 
ABBY I'm not desperate! (then) Why, did I sound desperate? 
MIKE Listen to you -- desperately asking me if you sound desperate. 
A concerned look from Abby as...the phone rings. Her caller I.D. says SACRAMENTO MED.                                              * 
MIKE Don't worry, in five seconds he'll call back. 
ABBY (skeptical) What are you, Nostradamus? That's -- 
The phone RINGS again.

ABBY (CONT'D) (in awe) -- amazing. 
He hustles her out of the room. A moment after the door closes, Mike rushes back in and hangs up the ringing phone. He smiles, then bolts. 
47   INT. COLIN'S OFFICE - DAY                                         47

COLIN Unbelievable. 
48   EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET ­ DAY                                        48 
Abby and Mike walk down the street. 
MIKE Rule number one. Never criticize. 
ABBY Even if it's constructive? 
MIKE Never. Men are incapable of growth, change or progress. For men, self- improvement ends at toilet- training. Rule number two. Laugh at whatever he says. 
ABBY What if what he's saying isn't funny? 
MIKE That's irrelevant. A fake laugh is like a fake orgasm. 
ABBY And a fake orgasm is good? 
MIKE No, but a fake orgasm is better than no orgasm at all. 
ABBY A fake orgasm is no orgasm. 
(CONTINUED) 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008 48   CONTINUED:                                                    48 
MIKE Only to you. You're not the only person in the room, you know. Let's not be selfish. 
Abby giggles. Mike is struck by the sound of her laughter. 
MIKE (CONT"D) That was perfect. You have a perfect laugh. Real or fake? 
ABBY You'll never know. 
He raises an eyebrow, impressed. 
49   INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY - CONTINUOUS                           49 
Mike and Abby wait for their lattes. 
MIKE Rule number three. Never talk about your problems. Men don't really listen or care. 
ABBY Some men care. 
MIKE No. Some men pretend to care. When we ask you how you're doing, it's just guy code for "let me put my dick in your ass." 
ABBY Okay, I'm trying to decide whether I should just walk away right now, or run. 
MIKE I know you think Colin is above it all, but he's a guy. If he's even remotely into you, he's thought about each one of your orifices at least ten times. 
ABBY I love how you assume every man is as perverse as you are. 
MIKE I don't assume. I know. 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008 
50   EXT. STREET - DAY - CONTINUOUS                                    50 
Mike and Abby walk along, coffees in hand. 
MIKE Rule number four. Men are very visual. Ninety percent of a relationship is based on how good the woman looks. We have to change your look. 
ABBY What's wrong with my look? 
MIKE (taking her in) Sports bras? Khakis? Srunchies? Nurse shoes? 
ABBY These aren't nurse shoes! They're Lady Keds. 
MIKE Abby, you're a very attractive woman but you are completely inaccessible. You're all about comfort and efficiency. 
ABBY What's wrong with comfort and efficiency? 
MIKE Nothing. Except no one wants to fuck it. 
With that, a MONTAGE BEGINS... 
51   INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY                                       51 
Mike and Abby wander through the racks of lingerie. 
MIKE (acting old) "My name's Abby and I'm arthritic and alone. I have eighteen cats who keep me company." 
ABBY (sarcastic) Oh, ha ha. That's very funny. (pretending to be Mike) "Are you wearing underwear?" 
She grabs his ass. 
MIKE Come on! I wouldn't say that and I wouldn't grab ass.

ABBY (still as Mike) "Hey babe, what's wrong with a little ass grabbing?" (continuing to pinch his ass) "I mean what's the point of you even having one unless it's there for me to grab it? You're just a set of orifices and a pair of tee- tas." 
MIKE You're a deeply, deeply disturbed person. 
Switching tactics, Abby slips into seductress mode, tracing her finger up and down his arm. 
ABBY Maybe I'm just a good student. 
MIKE Would you stop doing that? 
ABBY Doing what? 
MIKE Touching me with your finger. 
She seductively leans into him. 
ABBY Why? Am I turning you on? 
MIKE Maybe. 
She gives him a look. 
ABBY Actually, I kind of like it. 
MIKE Really... 
She leans in closer. 
ABBY Sucker. 
He shoves her away.

MIKE No teaching the teacher. 
Just then, the doorbell RINGS. 
ABBY Who is it? 
COLIN (O.S.) It's Colin. 
ABBY Oh my God! 
MIKE Told you he'd drop by. 
ABBY (panicking) I'm not ready for this. Am I? I'm not. 
MIKE Calm down. Keep the conversation under a minute. Be mysterious. Keep him guessing. 
Mike leaps over the couch and hides. As Abby walks over to the door and opens it. Colin stands there. 
ABBY Oh. Hey. 
COLIN Hi. Wow, you look great. 
ABBY Thanks. 
COLIN What happened to you today? 
ABBY What do you mean? 
COLIN You put me on hold and didn't call me back. 
ABBY That was you? I'm so sorry. (steering him to the door) (MORE)

She hustles him out the door. 
ABBY (CONT'D) Bye. 
Colin bangs on the door. 
COLIN (0.S.) Abby wait... 
Mike pops up from under the couch. He gives her the thumbs up. 
ABBY (whispering) Now what? 
MIKE Make him suffer. 
ABBY You're not like the other guys I've dated. 
FAN Hey, sit down, jackass. 
Mike waves him off, trying to remain focused on Abby. 
MIKE (to Abby) You're so much more interesting and informed. 
ABBY You're so much more interesting and informed. 
COLIN That's nice to hear. 
The fan throws peanuts at Mike. Mike turns around and shouts at the fan. 
MIKE Dude, what the fuck?! 
ABBY Dude, what the fuck?! 
COLIN What? 
Abby blanches, waiting for Mike instructions. 
MIKE Oh, shit. 
ABBY Oh, shit. 
Colin is now just staring at her. 
MIKE (to Abby) No, I'm not talking to you. 
ABBY I'm not talking to you. 
COLIN Did I do something wrong?

MIKE Abby, listen -- tell him you saw him looking at another girl. It's the only way out of this. 
ABBY (to Colin) Were you looking at another girl? 
COLIN Who? 
ABBY Uh -- her? 
She points to the only nearby female -- an Elderly Obese Hot Dog Lady. 
COLIN Yeah. I was just trying to get us a hot dog. 
ABBY Oh. 
There's an awkward moment as Colin hands her the hot dog. 
MIKE Alright, we need a recovery. Make sure to eat your hot dog slowly. Men like watching penis-shaped food go into a girl's mouth. 
ABBY What?! 
Repulsed, she flinches, losing control of her drink, DUMPING it into Colin's lap. He flinches. 
ABBY Oh my God, I'm so sorry. 
She grabs a napkin and starts rubbing his khakis. 
COLIN It's fine, really... 
ABBY No, I have to get it out or else it will stain -- 
She puts some muscle into it.

ABBY (CONT'D) What fabric is this... 
COLIN Cotton. 
ABBY Cotton's the worst. Well actually leather's the worst, followed by suede... 
Unbeknownst to them, the batter hits a pop fly near them. 
THE JUMBOTRON CAMERA follows the guy catching the fly, then finds Abby and Colin. PANS over to them and -- 
It looks like Abby is giving Colin an enthusiastic HAND JOB. 
The ENTIRE STADIUM, ballplayers included, stop what they're doing and stare. 
ABBY (CONT'D) Are you sure they're cotton cause this should be coming out, wait... it's coming. It's definitely coming. It's...done! 
She smiles at Colin. As he looks nervously up at the JUMBOTRON. 
Abby follows his gaze -- and sees SHE'S ON IT. Everyone at the stadium is looking at her. The organ player bangs out "Charge." The stadium starts WHOOPING and HOLLERING.

JONAH So she likes to make fun of your clothes and stuff? 
MIKE No, actually I make fun of hers'.

MIKE That's right. And you should listen to me. 
JONAH If you know so much about chicks, why are you sitting here playing "Fight Night" with me when you could be out with the Jello girls? 
MIKE Because this is better. 
Elizabeth enters, wearing a pair of sweats and carrying her laptop. She hands Mike a digital camera. 
ELIZABETH Hurry, take a picture of me. I'm online with Fugly35 and he wants to know what i look like. 
MIKE You really want to go out with a guy named Fugly35? 
ELIZABETH He's being ironic. Look, he's hot. 
She holds up her laptop. Mike peers at it. 
MIKE Uh...look closer. That's Jim Morrison. Who I'm pretty sure isn't an accountant in Rio Rancho. 
ELIZABETH Shit. Are you serious? 
Jonah holds out his hand to his mom. 
JONAH You owe me a dollar.

A cage of randy Bonobos getting it on. Mike, in a gorilla suit, does a segment. Next to him is an anthropologist, DR. LESTER. 
DR. LESTER Of all primates, Bonobos are the closest relatives to human beings, both genetically and socially ­- especially when it comes to sex. For the Bonobo, sex is a way to ease stress and diffuse tensions. 
MIKE So summing up Bonobo-land, the chicks look great, get freaky in bed and in turn, they get to sit on their asses and boss their men around all day. 
DR. LESTER That's one way of looking at it. 
MIKE If that's not an argument for evolution, I don't know what is. 
He winks at the camera as --

ABBY (cutting him off) Colin called. He wants to get together again. 
MIKE Cool. 
He starts pulling off his gorilla suit as he heads for the van. Abby follows him. 
ABBY How long do you think I should wait to sleep with him? 
MIKE The more you make him beg for it, the more you've got him on the hook. Do everything but. Then show him beneath that control freak exterior, there's a sexual deviant waiting to be unleashed. 
ABBY I am not a sexual deviant. 
MIKE Good point. If memory serves us right, you've been out of practice for what? A year? 
ABBY (defensive) No...eleven months.

Abby tries to kick Mike. As she does, she unwittingly knocks over her purse. The contents spill out and the REMOTE for her vibrating underwear rolls away, stopping UNDER THE TABLE NEXT TO THEM. 
AT THE NEXT TABLE 
A PRECOCIOUS KID, 8, sits with his parents. Bored out of his skull. When the remote rolls under his feet, the kid picks it up and flicks the switch. A small RED LIGHT turns on.

JAY So what's your number one piece of advice to all the people out there who are trying to find love? 
MIKE Don't do it. Try to find lust instead. It's a lot easier and a lot less messy. Blue balls only last a few hours. A broken heart can last years. 
The audience reacts with hollers and cheers. Abby shakes her head. 
JAY So, what's her name? 
MIKE Who? 
JAY The girl who screwed you up. She must have been a doozy. 
Mike looks a bit taken aback, but recovers quickly. 
MIKE Like I said, better a floozy than a doozy. 
Abby cocks her head, intrigued by Mike's reaction. 
JAY Well, what do you say to guys like me who have been happily married for twenty-seven years? We can't be the exception to the rule, can we? There's plenty of us out there. 
MIKE Well, Jay, let me tell ya -- 
He hesitates, then looks at Abby for a moment. She gives him an encouraging nod. He gains confidence, and continues.

By year twenty, you've learned to completely tune out the sound of her voice and it occurs to you that ever since you walked down the aisle, you're living with someone who can barely tolerate your presence and, on the rare occasion that you actually do make love, she probably thinks about Jake Gyllenhaal.

They hug. It's long hug. They give a quick kiss. 
ABBY (CONT'D) (cont'd) Good night.

MIKE Good night. 
Neither lets go. They give a longer kiss. 
ABBY Good night. 
MIKE Good night. 
Mike starts out the elevator, then returns, grabbing Abby. And suddenly -- 
They're ALL OVER EACH OTHER. 
In the midst of this, the elevators try to close but their furious groping blocks it, until -- 
A shrill BUZZING begins. They abruptly step apart staring at each other. 
MIKE (cont'd) So, I guess I should -- 
ABBY Yeah. 
Mike backs out of the elevator, looking shell-shocked. The doors close. Abby is flushed and stunned. 
ABBY (cont'd) Wow. 
93   INT. UNIVERSAL HILTON - ABBY`S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER               93 
Abby sinks down onto her bed, wearing the same expression. 
ABBY What the hell was that? And why do I want to do it again? 
There's a KNOCK at the door. She leaps up, smooths her hair, checks her reflection, and goes to the door. Opening it with a smile, she finds -- 
Standing there, bottle of red wine in hand, is... Colin. 
COLIN Miss me? 
It takes a moment for Abby to adjust. 
(CONTINUED) 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008 93   CONTINUED:                                                        93 
ABBY Colin? 
COLIN You were expecting someone else? 
ABBY (recovering) Uh, no -- 
He walks in the room, holding up the wine. 
COLIN Since you couldn't come to Santa Fe, I decided to come to you. 
ABBY How'd you find me? 
COLIN Joy told me. I started thinking about all the things we were going to do there and I decided I couldn't wait. 
ABBY Oh. Okay... 
COLIN What's the matter? 
ABBY Nothing. I'm just so -- surprised to see you. 
COLIN Well, you told me you were spontaneous. Guess the proof is in the pudding. 
ABBY (tense) It sure is... 
As he opens the wine, some of it splashes on his shirt. 
COLIN Whoops. Looks like we'll have to get naked sooner than I thought. 
94   INT. UNIVERSAL HILTON - EXT. ABBY'S DOOR - NIGHT - SAME TIME 94 
Mike approaches Abby's door.

MIKE Abby -- I really need to kiss you again. And not just in a one-night stand way, in a totally different way. Oh fuck, what am I doing? 
He turns and walks the other direction. Then stops and turns back. 
MIKE (cont'd) Nut up, Alexander. You can do this... 
COLIN (CONT'D) (cont'd) You never try to control the situation, and I've got to say, it's a breath of fresh air. A lot of women I know are total control freaks -- and it's a nightmare. I love that you're not like that. 
Abby looks at him, nodding, then -- 
ABBY You know what? I am like that. 
COLIN What do you mean? 
(CONTINUED) 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008 96   CONTINUED: (2)                                                   96 
ABBY To be honest, I didn't like the way you poured the wine. I would have decanted it. And I was editing that speech as you were giving it. 
She looks around. 
ABBY (CONT'D) (cont'd) Plus, this bed should be facing north-south instead of east-west! 
COLIN (confused) Are you serious? 
ABBY I haven't been myself for one second of the two weeks and five days we've been dating. 
COLIN Then who have you been? 
ABBY The girl some idiot told me to be. 
97   EXT. LAX   AIRPORT - DAY                                         97 
Taxis drop off tourists. 
98   INT. AIRPORT - DAY                                               98 
Abby paces in front of the gate and checks her watch, while talking on her cell phone. 
ABBY (into phone) And you're sure he checked out? Okay, thanks. 
She hangs up the phone. A FLIGHT ATTENDANT approaches her. 
FLIGHT ATTENDANT Miss, we're going to need you to board now. 
Resigned, she picks up her bag and walks on board. 
99   INT. KPHX - LOBBY ­ DAY                                          99 
Abby walks into the station, greeting the security guard.

ABBY Morning, Freddy. 
The security guard just looks at her and shakes his head, disappointed. Stuart rushes up to her. 
STUART I thought you said we had him. 
ABBY What are you talking about? 
STUART He quit this morning. I got a smug call from Channel 4 saying they closed a deal with him. Corporate's having a shit fit. What the hell happened? 
Abby is hurt and stunned, but overcomes it with fierce and abiding hatred. 
ABBY We don't need Mike Alexander. He's a dime a dozen. 
STUART You better hope so, because you're going to find me a new one by the end of the week. 
100   INT. KPHX - WAITING AREA - DAY                                   100 
Abby and Joy walk through the waiting area, which is filled with MIKE ALEXANDER REPLACEMENT HOPEFULS of all different shapes and sizes. Abby points at candidates, while Joy makes notes on a clipboard. 
ABBY (pointing) Yes. No. Yes. No. No. (then) I can't believe I even considered for a second allowing myself to feel something for him. 
JOY I still can't believe that you broke up with Colin. 
ABBY I know I can't control everything. As much as I'd like to. (MORE)

She turns back to the candidates, frustrated. 
ABBY (cont'd) Yes. No. No. Yes. Fuck no. 
101   INT. KPQU, CHANNEL 4 STAGE - DAY                                  101 
Channel 4's brighter and more expensive stage, with a prominent logo for "MORNING MAYHEM WITH MIKE!" 
Mike, dressed in an Armani suit, glandhands the Channel 4 suits, as they show him around. 
BIG WIG What do you think of the new set? 
MIKE Love it. 
BIG WIG #2 KPHX retained the copyright to your old segment title, so we retitled you "Morning Mayhem with Mike!" 
Mike's on autopilot. 
105   INT. MIKE'S APARTMENT - DAY - SAME TIME                             105 
Jonah watches TV as Mike gets a beer out of the fridge. 
JONAH Dude, check this out. Your replacement's on. 
MIKE My what? 
Mike looks over to see -- 
ON THE TV -- Live footage from the Balloon Fiesta. Jack Magnum continues to alienate his audience. 
JACK MAGNUM Most of you are watching this show so you can learn how to get chicks. Let me assure you, you're in good hands. You're looking at a guy who's personally had sex with over 137 women. Most of them conscious. 
106   EXT. FIELD - DAY - CONTINUOUS                                       106 
Abby looks at Joy, panicked. 
ABBY He's ad-libbing. Why is he ad- libbing? There's no ad-libbing. 
107   INT. MIKE'S APARTMENT - DAY - CONTINUOUS                            107 
Mike sits down on the couch to watch. 
MIKE Oh, this is beautiful. 
(CONTINUED) 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008 107   CONTINUED:                                                       107 
ON TV -- Jack Magnum just makes it worse. 
JACK MAGNUM (ON T.V.) We're here at the Balloon Fiesta, and I'm supposed to be telling you men are full of hot air, but I think we all know, it's the ladies that are full of crap. Just because she says no, doesn't mean she means no. 
At this Jack Magnum is tackled and pushed out of the balloon basket. After a moment -- 
A frazzled ABBY pops up in his place. 
ABBY (ON T.V.) (nervous) Hi! I'm sorry, but Jack Magnum will no longer be able to do "The Ugly Truth" segment. Which should really come as no surprise. Because men are completely unreliable. 
108   INT. KPHX - DAY - CONTINUOUS                                     108 
Stuart and Cliff watch from the control room, in shock. 
CLIFF What is she doing? 
The PHONE RINGS. Stuart picks up, then blanches. 
STUART (into phone) Hey, Harold. Yes, I know -- we're fixing it. 
109   EXT. FIELD - DAY - CONTINUOUS                                    109 
Abby stands in the basket, still nervous, but flying on adrenaline. Joy gives her a "keep going" hand gesture. 
ABBY Take Mike Alexander, for instance. He up and quit the show without so much as a word. You think you know what men are going to do, you think you know what they want to do...but when it comes down to the moment where they actually have to nut up, they turn around and do something completely different.

110   INT. MIKE'S APARTMENT - DAY - CONTINUOUS                         110 
Mike stares at Abby on TV for a second, then grabs his keys. 
MIKE Oh, I'm all over this. 
He races out, as Jonah calls after him. 
JONAH I don't think she's into you,guy! 
111   EXT. FIELD - DAY - CONTINUOUS                                    111 
Joy and the camera guy watch as Abby gains steam, ranting to the camera. B-CAMERA, strapped to the basket, also records. 
ABBY The big, strong, romantic men we've been reading about in novels and watching in movies since we were nine? They're fallacies. "Blue Lagoon" is a total freakin' lie. Men are not strong. Men are not brave. Men are afraid. 
112   INT. KPHX - "SACRAMENTO AM" SET - DAY                            112 * 
From the news desk, Georgia and Larry watch the monitor, confused. 
LARRY (offended) I love "Blue Lagoon". 
Georgia squeezes his hand. 
GEORGIA I know you do, honey. 
113   EXT. FIELD - PARKING LOT - DAY - CONTINUOUS                      113 
Mike's truck careens into the parking lot. He gets out, racing towards the field. 
114   EXT. FIELD - DAY - CONTINUOUS                                    114 
Abby is now on a total tear. 
ABBY ...They're afraid to say what they feel. Afraid to grow up. Afraid to tell the truth. 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008 
115   INT. MIKE'S APARTMENT - DAY - CONTINUOUS                         115

122   INT. HOT AIR BALLOON BASKET - SKY - DAY - CONTINUOUS               122 
Abby glares at Mike, not realizing they're still on the air. 
ABBY (freaked) I hate you so much I just swore on live television. 
MIKE No, you hate yourself for being so shallow. 
PILOT Off we go! 
Abby and Mike spin around to look at him.       Realizing the balloon is now soaring upwards. 
ABBY Where are we going?! 
MIKE I'm not going anywhere with you. 
Mike starts to climb out. 
ABBY What a shock. You're bailing. 
PILOT I wouldn't recommend that... 
Mike looks down to see -- 
They are now FIFTEEN FEET ABOVE THE GROUND. And rising.         He stops climbing, as the balloon continues to float up and away. 
PILOT (cont'd) So, who wants champagne? 
123   INT. KPHX - CONTROL ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS                        123 
Stuart and Cliff stare at the monitors, eating it up. 
STUART They don't know the camera is on, do they? 
CLIFF (smiling) Nuh-uh. 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008 
124   EXT. SKY - DAY - A MOMENT LATER                                  124 
Now holding champagne glasses, a disgusted Mike and Abby look at opposite ends of the sky, hating that they are trapped together. 
MIKE Hey! I know -- we can pass the time with you telling me how much fun you and Colin had having sex in Los Angeles. 
ABBY I broke up with Colin in Los Angeles, jackass. 
Mike is thrown, turning to look at her. 
MIKE What? 
PILOT To our left, we have the Sandia Mountains, glistening in the afternoon twilight... 
Abby ignores the pilot. 
ABBY Oh, that got your interest? If you think we're going to finish what we started in LA, you're out of your mind. You lost your chance. 
PILOT And to our right, you'll see the Rio Grande River winding its way through the diochramatic landscape... 
Mike ignores the pilot as well. 
MIKE I never had a chance with you. 
PILOT And off in the distance, we have the Petroglyph National Monument, where -- 
ABBY (to the Pilot) Can you stop talking, please? (MORE)

MIKE What does that mean? 
ABBY (mocking) "I'm Mike Alexander. I like girls in Jello. I like to fuck like a monkey. Don't fall in love -- it's `scary.'" 
125   EXT. FIELD - DAY - CONTINUOUS                                      125 
Joy talks on the phone to Stuart. 
JOY Don't worry, I saw this coming, so I got us a three second delay. 
126   INT. HOT AIR BALLOON BASKET - SKY - DAY - CONTINUOUS               126 
Mike glares at Abby. 
MIKE Yeah, it is "scary." It's fucking terrifying. Especially because I'm in love with a psycho like you. 
127   INT. MIKE'S APARTMENT - DAY - CONTINUOUS                           127 
Jonah now sits with Elizabeth.       They both stare at the TV in shock. 
ELIZABETH Did he just say -- 
JONAH "Love"?

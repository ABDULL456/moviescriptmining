FADE IN: 
EXT. DARK FOREST - NIGHT 
FLAMES fill the SCREEN. Then: the gentle voice of an OLD WOMAN, barely more than a whisper... 
OLD WOMAN (V.O.) I am a common woman. I was born in a common cottage in a common village. My life would likely be no different from yours, were it not for the most uncommon events that occurred during the winter of the Year of Our Lord Thirteen Hundred and Twenty-five. I learned many things that winter. About people. About love. But mainly, I learned about loss. A MAN tosses a piece of wood into the flames, which turns out to be a LARGE CAMPFIRE. 
OLD WOMAN (V.O.) To this day, I am the only person that I know to be living who knows the whole truth about that horrible time. This is my tale. CAMERA PULLS BACK, revealing THREE KNIGHTS, beleaguered, scarred, returning from the Crusades. Their armor is in disarray, adorned with souvenirs from the Middle East. They're camped in a clearing, their cart pulled to a nearby roadside. LIGHTNING flashes in the distance. One of them, a TEENAGE BOY who looks like his sword might weigh more than he does, hitches a nervous HORSE to a tree. He strokes the horse's neck, calming. Then: A WOLF HOWLS in the distance. The Boy suddenly looks nervous, too. He quickly joins the others at the campfire -- a FAT KNIGHT (30s) and an OLD KNIGHT. 
TEENAGE BOY Did you hear that? 
FAT KNIGHT Hear what? The wolf HOWLS AGAIN. The Boy shivers, fearful. 
TEENAGE BOY The innkeeper told me -- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
FAT KNIGHT I know what he told you. He told you about the Wolf. The Beast of Villiers la CroisÃ©e. (off Boy's look) The people of that village have been spreading that nonsense since before you were a tickle in your daddy's prick. I'd give you a whipping for believing it if I thought it would do any good. The Old Knight stares into the fire, then speaks. 
OLD KNIGHT I used to travel these woods. They told the same stories then that they do now. Only I heard them from a man who actually saw the beast with his own eyes. 
FAT KNIGHT Half the people in these parts claim to have seen it. 
OLD KNIGHT This man claimed it was the last thing he ever saw. The Wolf took his eyes. And half his face. (off their looks) I saw his scars and empty eye sockets. His skin looked like it was on inside-out. It didn't seem to me like the kind of thing a man would make up a story about. He shrugs. His companions exchange an unnerved look. 
EXT. DARK FOREST - NIGHT (LATER) 
It's raining now. The Knights sleep underneath the cart for shelter. Lightning FLASHES. Then, from O.S., the horse gives a series of frightened NEIGHS. The Boy stirs, but by the time he awakens, there is only the sound of the RAIN. Did he imagine it? He reluctantly decides to venture out to investigate. The Boy hurries over to where he tied the horse... but all he finds is the empty rope blowing in the wind. In a FLASH of lightning, he sees that the horse is gone. Then he hears something. A strange GNAWING sound. TEARING and POPPING. He slowly turns... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Not far away, he makes out a shape in the darkness. The horse is on its side, WHEEZING helplessly. And there's something crouched next to it. We can't make out what it is, only a MAN-LIKE SHAPE, shrouded in shadow. Whatever it is, it's eating the horse alive. The Boy steps away in horror, then hurriedly stumbles back to his companions and frantically shakes them awake. 
FAT KNIGHT What the devil are you --?! 
TEENAGE BOY Wait, wait! Be quiet! He raises a hand. He's heard something. They listen. FOOTSTEPS. Approaching through the mud. The Boy's hand clutches a dagger, but the Fat Knight reaches out and stays him, terrified. The Boy follows his look. We never get a good look at THE FIGURE walking toward them. But what the men see scares them shitless. It stops near the cart. The men huddle together, watching as it slowly starts to walk around the cart -- -- then suddenly jumps atop it. The Figure is now above them. With each step it takes, the boards of the wooden cart CREAK and bend under its weight. A long beat. Then the Figure jumps down again, landing behind the men, startling them. It pauses. The men cower, shivering... Suddenly, the cart is flipped over as if it weighed nothing, revealing the terrified Knights beneath it. Lightning FLASHES. A shadow falls over them. The men scramble to their feet, but the Old Knight slips in the mud. The Boy stops to help him, but then the Old Knight starts screaming, something GROWLS, and the Boy stops short at what he sees. The Fat Knight runs. 
TEENAGE BOY Wait! We have to help him! The Fat Knight ignores him. The Old Knight shrieks. We hear the same TEARING and POPPING that this thing made while eating the horse. The Boy quickly looks around... ... sees a curved Arabian scimitar lying in the mud, fallen from the overturned wagon. He grabs it and as the Fat Knight runs, the Boy stands his ground. He hefts the blade. He's young, but he has used this before. A lot. Rain beats down on his face and lightning FLASHES as he confronts the thing that is devouring the Old Knight. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) The Fat Knight runs through the forest without looking back. He hears a loud HOWL behind him and runs faster. Then he hears the Boy SCREAMING and blind panic sets in, his head filled with the sounds of his HEAVY BREATHING and RUNNING FOOTFALLS in the mud and crashing THUNDER. He's running so fast he nearly falls into the RUSHING RIVER that crosses his path. He quickly looks for a way to cross. The river is gorged and the water is moving fast. Then, in a flash of lightning, he spots it -- A fallen tree spans the river. The Knight hurries to it. The bark is smooth and slick from the rain. He can't stand on it. He has to crawl. He edges out on his hands and knees, his eyes flicking nervously at the waters surging underneath him. He has almost made it across... ... when he hears a LOW SNARL. He freezes. Looks back. Lightning FLASHES. The Figure, still obscured to us, stands on the riverbank behind the Knight. It GROWLS. The Knight tries to crawl away, but slips and nearly falls in the river. Then suddenly, the tree beneath him begins to move. He hangs on for his life and looks back. The Figure is on the tree behind him, slowly closing in. He starts to crawl, slips again. No way he can get away. He looks down into the racing river waters. Then back at the Figure closing in. The choice is clear. The Fat Knight dives headfirst off the tree -- -- but he never hits the water. Something grabs him by the legs and stops him short. He cries out and looks up at the thing that is dangling him helplessly above the water. He weeps. Then, abruptly -- -- he is yanked up out of sight. 
EXT. VILLAGE - DAY 
A BUTCHER quickly and expertly cuts the throat of a pig that has been hung upside down by its hind legs. It kicks and squirms as it bleeds out into a pan. VILLAGERS bustle along a muddy road. A MERCHANT sells his wares. Dogs run and BARK. A DISHEVELLED MAN locked up in the stockade. A BLACKSMITH's hammer CLANGS. On the surface, a typical medieval village. But something is wrong here. A pall hangs over the place. The people are subdued, beaten. A TITLE comes up: 
FRANCE 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: There's a SIGN in the village green. Hanging from it is a wood plank with a crude drawing of a moon on it, three- quarters full. The moon has a vaguely sinister face... 
INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - LOFT - DAY 
A tiny spider spins its web. CAMERA RACKS FOCUS to a pretty 17-year-old GIRL gazing up at it. Her name is ISABELLE. She scoops the spider up, watches it crawl around on her hand, fascinated. 
EXT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - DAY 
PETER Same time tomorrow? 
ISABELLE Don't get used to this. I start my sewing lessons next week. 
PETER You really think you can go all day without seeing me? 
ISABELLE I'll manage somehow. Pride is a cardinal sin, by the way. 
PETER I can think of worse sins I could be committing. She gives a cautioning look, then leaves with a smile. 
EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - DAWN 
The VILLAGE HERALD is changing the plank on the moon sign. He replaces the picture of the three-quarters moon with a picture of a half moon, its face indifferent. 
HERALD Half full! Half full! 
INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - COMMON ROOM - DAWN 
Suzette is putting bread and cheese into a basket. Isabelle pulls on a drab hooded cloak. 
SUZETTE You mind your grandmother, understand? You're her student now, the same as the other girls. 
ISABELLE Yes, Mother. Suzette hands her the basket with a proud look. 
SUZETTE My last baby has grown up. 
EXT. VILLAGE - CROSSROADS - MORNING 
Isabelle watches a DEAF BOY perform simple sleight of hand magic tricks. His name is CLAUDE (14). She applauds his performance and hands him a coin. He makes it 'disappear,' then smiles big and runs away. A crazy old woman, LUCRECE, shoots Isabelle a look. 
LUCRECE You're only encouraging him. 
ISABELLE I know. THREE GIRLS (ages 16-18) approach: ROXANNE (round-faced, cheery and instantly likable), PRUDENCE (practical, serious), and ROSEMARIA (pretty, arrogant, flirtatious). A playful PUPPY tags along. Prudence and Rosemaria look tired, but Roxanne greets Isabelle with a big smile. 
ISABELLE You look happy. 
ROXANNE Aren't you excited? 
PRUDENCE It's too early to be excited. 
ROXANNE I'm just trying to look on the bright side. 
ROSEMARIA Well, stop it before somebody hurts you. The girls have a laugh at Roxanne's expense. 
EXT. VILLAGE - OUTSKIRTS - MORNING 
The girls leave the village on a trail that leads through the dark forest. The puppy stops at the edge of the forest. Then it WHINES and refuses to follow. 
EXT. DARK FOREST - PATH - MORNING 
The trail stretches out in front of the girls as far as they can see. Rosemaria walks with Roxanne. Prudence hangs back with Isabelle, brimming with juicy gossip. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
PRUDENCE Did you hear about her and the Darley brothers? 
ISABELLE Oh, no! Which one? 
PRUDENCE Both! On the same night! Isabelle gives an incredulous look and Prudence tries to contain her laughter. Rosemaria hears and looks back at them. She scowls at Isabelle. 
ROSEMARIA Why does your grandmother have to live so far away? 
ISABELLE What's the matter, Rosemaria? Having trouble walking? Prudence laughs. Roxanne frowns, disapproving. Rosemaria shoots Isabelle a dirty look. 
EXT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - DAY 
The girls cross a little wooden bridge that spans a BABBLING brook and follow the trail to a large cottage, well past its prime. Chickens CLUCK and peck around it. An OLD WOMAN opens the door and waves to them. She's stooped and withered, but her eyes are bright and beautiful. She wears a blue belted gown and a necklace with a crucifix on it. This is Isabelle's GRANDMOTHER. 
PETER Look at me. Just look at me and tell me you didn't know. She looks at him and sees it in his eyes. He's serious. 
ISABELLE Who told you this? 
PETER Your father. Off Isabelle's look... 
INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - COMMON ROOM - NIGHT 
The family is gathered around the table. Isabelle and Lucie listen to their parents in stunned silence. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
SUZETTE It's all been arranged. Your marriage to Henri will settle our debt to his father. Isabelle nods, shaken. Cesaire sees that she's upset. 
SUZETTE We know that you and Peter have become friends. But you have adult responsibilities now. That means putting your family's interests ahead of your own. 
ISABELLE So Henri Smith is in the family's interest and Peter is not? 
CESAIRE Peter is a fine young man. 
ISABELLE But what? He's poor? He's an orphan? 
SUZETTE He's not one of us. His parents were outsiders. 
ISABELLE Why? Because they hadn't lived here since Noah built the ark? 
SUZETTE You mind your tongue. Isabelle is about to respond, when she notices something. Lucie is crying. A beat. Lucie looks up at her parents. 
LUCIE Do you realize how this makes me look? I'm older than her by more than a year. If anyone should be getting married in the spring, it's me. Everyone is taken aback. Lucie storms out of the cottage, angrily wiping tears. Isabelle watches her go. 
INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - COMMON ROOM - NIGHT 
Cesaire smokes his pipe, troubled. Suzette sits nearby. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
CESAIRE This was your idea. Now I have both of them hating me. In the loft, Isabelle and Lucie are in bed... but Isabelle only pretends to be asleep so she can eavesdrop. 
SUZETTE We knew Isabelle was going to be stubborn. It wouldn't be like her to simply do as she's told. She's too much like her grandmother. 
CESAIRE That she is. What about Lucie? 
SUZETTE She's a good girl, but she's still a child. Talk to her. You're her father. She'll listen to you. Isabelle glances over at Lucie... and sees that she's been eavesdropping, too. Lucie turns away, embarrassed. Isabelle gives her a sad look. 
EXT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - DAY 
There's a knock at the door. Isabelle answers, revealing HENRI (18). He's tall and good-looking, but still awkward in his body. Isabelle eyes him, a little aloof. 
HENRI Hello, Isabelle. 
ISABELLE Hello, Henri. 
EXT. VILLAGE - ROAD - DAY 
Isabelle and Henri walk in awkward silence. Then: 
HENRI So I suppose you've heard. 
ISABELLE Yes. My parents are very pleased. 
HENRI And you? Are you pleased? 
ISABELLE It's a very generous arrangement. 
(CONTINUED) 
PETER Go home, Isabelle. Go home and grow up. Isabelle gapes at him. Peter walks away. 
ISABELLE I don't believe you! He doesn't look back. She watches him go, heartbroken. 
EXT. CREEK - DAWN 
Cesaire bathes in a cold stream. The sun is just barely rising, rays of light shining through the trees. He smiles. It looks like the start of a beautiful day. 
EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - DAWN 
The village is bustling with activity, but there's a palpable tension. The picture on the moon sign is of a three-quarters moon... but then the Herald changes it to a picture of a FULL MOON with a cruel, malevolent face. 
HERALD Full moon! Full moon! Full moon! 
INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - MORNING 
Isabelle emerges from the cottage. Roxanne, Prudence, and Rosemaria are outside waiting on her. They all start toward the village, but then Isabelle sees something... In the shadows next to the cottage, Cesaire is giving Lucie a stern lecture. Lucie turns and sees Isabelle. Her face is ashen and there are tears in her eyes. Isabelle starts toward them, but Cesaire stops her. 
CESAIRE This doesn't concern you, Isabelle. 
ISABELLE Yes, Father. Isabelle reluctantly turns and walks away. The girls follow her. Roxanne gives Lucie a concerned look. 
EXT. VILLAGE - MORNING 
The girls walk through the village. Isabelle is lost in thought, stung by her father's brusk dismissal. 
ROXANNE What's wrong with Lucie? 
ROSEMARIA How would you feel if you were in love with your sister's fiancÃ©e? Isabelle stops short and gives Rosemaria a sharp look. 
ISABELLE Lucie is not in love with my fiancÃ©e. 
ROSEMARIA Really? So she's just had a crush on him since she was ten? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
ISABELLE As if she would really tell you something like that. 
ROSEMARIA She didn't. She told my sister. (off Isabelle's look) Did you honestly not know? Isabelle clearly had no idea, but tries to hide it. Just then, they walk by the blacksmith's shop where Henri works with his father, ADRIEN. Henri smiles at Isabelle. 
ISABELLE Come on. We're going to be late. She turns away. Rosemaria gives her a smug look. 
EXT. DARK FOREST - PATH - DAWN 
The girls are walking down the path to Grandmother's cottage. Rosemaria lags behind, tired and grumpy. There's a fork in the path and Rosemaria stops at it. A SMALLER PATH branches off into the forest, overgrown and narrow. Rosemaria looks at it for a beat... Roxanne suddenly notices that Rosemaria isn't with them. She looks back and sees her start down the other path. 
ROXANNE Rosemaria...? The other girls stop and hurry back to the fork, dismayed to find Rosemaria headed down the overgrown path. 
ISABELLE What are you doing? 
ROSEMARIA What does it look like? 
ISABELLE You can't go that way. You have to stay on the path. 
ROSEMARIA This way is faster. 
PRUDENCE But it's not safe. My brother says the bridge is rotten. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
ROSEMARIA I don't care. It's bad enough working all day in that smelly cottage. It's not reasonable for them to expect us to walk that far every day on top of that. She walks away, defiant. The girls look nervous. Then: 
PRUDENCE If you get lost, nobody will come looking for you. Not tonight. This last part gives Rosemaria pause. She looks down the narrow path. It suddenly seems a little ominous. Grudgingly, she returns to the group. The other girls exchange quiet looks of relief. They continue on. The wind blows leaves across the abandoned path... 
INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - DAY 
Lucie nervously walks along the road leading away from the village. She startles at every sound. She looks up. The full moon is visible in the sky above her through the skeletal branches of the dark trees... She comes to the overgrown path that the girls stopped at earlier. Lucie takes a deep breath and starts down it... 
EXT. GULLY - NIGHT 
Lucie reaches an OLD ROPE BRIDGE. It spans a deep gully and a fast-moving river strewn with jagged rocks. Lucie gives the bridge a nervous look and starts across it... The boards CREAK loudly under her feet. The bridge sways in the wind. She carefully makes her way across, only breathing when she is safely on the other side. 
EXT. WOODS - CLEARING - NIGHT 
Lucie comes to a grassy meadow bathed with moonlight. She stands in the middle of it, next to a large rock, and looks all around. She's alone, cold and afraid. Then... ... she takes off her riding hood, folds it, and places it on the rock. She begins to disrobe, folding her dress and her undergarments and stacking them in a neat pile. Soon she's standing naked, her arms clutched around her breasts, shivering with cold. And fear. CAMERA PULLS BACK from this lonely naked figure until the dark branches of the trees obscure her from view. Then, somewhere, a WOLF HOWLS in the night... 
INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - LOFT - DAWN 
Isabelle wakes up, groggy. Lucie's bed is empty. 
EXT. DARK FOREST - DAY 
Children are playing, a BOY chasing several giggling GIRLS, growling and waving his hands like claws. 
BOY I'm the Wolf! I'm going to eat you up! 
EXT. DARK FOREST - CLEARING - DAY 
One of the Girls runs into the meadow and sees something that makes her stop short. The other Children gather behind her, all frozen by what they see... CROWS are picking at a bloody carcass. All we can see of it is a human hand. A crow gnaws on one of the fingers. 
INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - DAY 
The girls are at their lessons. Suddenly, there's an urgent KNOCK at the door. Everyone stops, surprised. Grandmother answers it. It's a YOUNG MAN, sweaty and out of breath from running. 
GRANDMOTHER What on earth --? The Young Man glances at Isabelle. Something about the look in his eyes makes Isabelle go pale... 
EXT. DARK FOREST - CLEARING - DAY 
Isabelle hurries into the clearing with Roxanne, Prudence, and Rosemaria trailing behind her. A crowd has gathered. She pushes through it, then stop short. Lucie is dead. We don't see what's been done to her, but Roxanne turns away and vomits. Cesaire and Suzette are already here. He holds her as she cries on his shoulder. Isabelle just stares at Lucie's body, shattered. 
INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Isabelle is curled in a fetal ball on the bed, clutching Lucie's cloak to her chest. She's cried her eyes out. Grandmother sets down a cup of tea. As Isabelle watches, Grandmother sprinkles a pinch of dark herbs in the tea. 
GRANDMOTHER It's my little secret. A pinch will help you rest. A little more and you'll sleep through the end of the world. Grandmother smiles. Isabelle smiles back, weak. 
ISABELLE I think I'd like that. 
EXT. VILLAGE - DAY 
Two men, the Merchant and the REEVE, gossip by the well. 
MERCHANT She had it coming, if you ask me. What the hell was she doing out there? Then they notice that Isabelle is right behind them, drawing a water from the well. Both men shift uncomfortably, but she pretends she didn't hear. 
INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - DAY 
Lucie's body lies on the table. Isabelle watches as Suzette and Grandmother bathe the body. Suddenly, Grandmother stops. She's found something clutched in Lucie's hand. A troubled look comes over her... 
ISABELLE What is it? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
GRANDMOTHER Nothing. Grandmother curtly wraps what she's found in a washcloth. 
INT. CHURCH - DAY 
Lucie's funeral. Cesaire and Suzette sit with Isabelle, who holds Grandmother's hand. The other girls are here, too. Roxanne sits with her mother, MARGUERITE, and Claude, the deaf boy we saw performing magic. The priest, FATHER AUGUSTE, conducts the service. 
FATHER AUGUSTE Wherefore each man and woman that is wise, make him ready thereto; for we all shall die, and we know not how soon... 
EXT. CHURCH - DAY 
Villagers leave the church. Claude is playing in the cemetery. Father Auguste frowns, disapproving. Marguerite sees this and angrily pulls Roxanne aside. 
(TO CESAIRE) I will help you kill it. Henri's father gives him a surprised look. But after another long beat, the Reeve stands up, too. 
REEVE As will I. We all will. Henri is nervous, but tries to appear brave for Isabelle. 
INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - COMMON ROOM - DAWN 
Isabelle is about to leave when she sees Lucie's red riding hood. She gives it a solemn look. 
EXT. DARK FOREST - PATH - DAWN 
A light snow has fallen. The girls are walking to Grandmother's house, but Isabelle sadly lags behind, lost in thought. She's wearing Lucie's red riding hood. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Roxanne waits for Isabelle and offers her hand. Isabelle smiles sadly and takes it. Prudence and Rosemaria let them catch up, then they continue on together... 
INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT 
Isabelle returns home. Suzette is making dinner, but stops short when she sees Isabelle in Lucie's red cloak. 
SUZETTE Who gave you permission to wear that? 
ISABELLE Nobody. I just -- 
SUZETTE Your Grandmother made that for Lucie. Take it off. Isabelle hesitates, then does as she's told. Suzette snatches the cloak away from her. A beat. 
ISABELLE It was folded when they found her. Her clothes, too. Did you notice that? 
SUZETTE Someone must have folded them. A beat. Isabelle is reluctant to voice her thoughts... 
ISABELLE She was so unhappy. Suzette turns, her eyes narrowing dangerously. 
SUZETTE What are you saying? 
ISABELLE Maybe she went into the woods on purpose. Maybe she wanted to die. Suddenly: Suzette slaps her across the face. Hard. 
SUZETTE Lucie's soul is at peace with God. Don't you ever again suggest otherwise. Suzette turns away in tears. Isabelle is stunned speechless. 
EXT. PETER'S COTTAGE - DAY 
Isabelle trudges through the mud toward a ramshackle cottage. If there had been train tracks in the fourteenth century, this place would have been on the wrong side of them. Isabelle gathers her nerve and knocks on the door. A long beat. The door opens. It's Peter. He gives her a surprised look. She looks up at him, choking back tears. 
PETER Are you all right? 
ISABELLE I'm sorry. I just need to talk to someone. Can I come in? Peter balks. Just then, a figure appears. Isabelle can't believe her eyes... It's Rosemaria. She's standing behind Peter, but it's clear that she's naked. 
ROSEMARIA No. You can't. She wraps an arm around Peter's waist. Isabelle gives him a stricken look and runs away. Peter watches her go. 
INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - DUSK 
Lessons are over. The girls are ready to leave except for Isabelle, who sits alone by the fire. Rosemaria gives her a sly look as she leaves. When the girls have gone, Grandmother sits down next to Isabelle. 
ISABELLE I hate the cold. Why can't we have lessons in the summer? 
GRANDMOTHER I suppose that would be easier. But then that would defeat the purpose. People only change when things are difficult. Isabelle gives her a look, understanding, then turns away. Grandmother puts a hand on her shoulder and then leaves her alone. Isabelle stares into the fire... 
INT. ROXANNE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT 
Roxanne comes home to a shocking scene: her mother, Marguerite, half-naked and wrapped in a blanket, 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: viciously beating Claude with a switch. Roxanne hurriedly pulls her off of him and he runs away. 
MARGUERITE I caught the little bastard watching us! 
ROXANNE Watching what? Just then, the Merchant enters from the bedroom, adjusting his clothes. He hesitates when he sees Roxanne, then drops a handful of coins on the table and leaves. Marguerite puts the coins in a leather purse. Roxanne glares at her. 
MARGUERITE It's money, isn't it? You could make twice this your first time. They pay more for virgins. Roxanne recoils in disgust and storms out in tears. 
EXT. DARK FOREST - HILLSIDE - NIGHT 
The Reeve leads the Men to the foot of a steep and rocky hill. It's a dead end. But then they hear the SCREAMS again. The Men look up at the hillside. 
CARPENTER The caves. It's in the caves. 
INT. CAVE - NIGHT 
The Men stand in the mouth of a wide cave, relighting their torches. The SCREAMING echoes from inside. The Carpenter raises his torch. The cave is as deep and dark as a monster's throat. The Men crowd start inside... The SCREAMING continues, unnerving the Men as they approach. Then they come to a fork in the tunnel. The SCREAMS bounce off the stone walls. Impossible to tell where it's coming from. 
REEVE Split up. Two groups. Half the Men take one fork, half the other. We follow the Reeve's group down a narrowing passageway. The Men crowd together, hunched low. The SCREAMS seem to be getting louder. The Reeve stops, listening. He turns toward a low crack in the cave wall. The SCREAMS are coming from inside. He shines his torch inside, lowers his head, and walks toward it. The cave 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: floor takes a steep dip. He has to keep one hand on the wall to keep from falling... Then suddenly, his feet skid on a patch of loose pebbles and he loses his footing. He slides down the steep floor, drops his torch, hands flailing, unable to stop himself, and then -- -- he finds himself falling off a low cliff into the darkness. He tumbles head over heels down a rocky slope and splashes hard in a shallow underground river. The torch rolls off the ledge above and falls on the shore amidst a shower of grit and pebbles. The Reeve gets up, grimacing in pain, grabs the torch. He shines it around... and sees Adrien. He's leaning against a rock, the ground beneath him wet with blood spreading from a dark wound between his legs. Reeve rushes to his side and crosses himself when he sees the wound. Then: a low, menacing, GROWL. He turns... There's a huge, SNARLING GRAY WOLF behind him. Adrien's pickaxe juts from between its shoulder blades. Reeve freezes, suddenly realizing that he's dropped his sword. He splashes around in the river, blindly feeling for it in the water. The wounded animal growls, blood bubbling from between its teeth. Reeve finds the sword -- -- just as the wolf attacks. 
EXT. VILLAGE - OUTSKIRTS - DAWN 
Silence. The sun is starting to light the sky, revealing a peacefully glistening blanket of snow on the village. The Men are returning from the woods. Isabelle and Suzette are among the Villagers breathlessly awaiting them. No way of telling whether they met with success or failure. But as they near... ... we can see Reeve leading the group, carrying a pike with the wolf's severed head on it. The Villagers CHEER, but the Men are weary and subdued. Suzette and Isabelle find Cesaire. He hugs them tight. Suddenly, a woman GASPS. Then they see: the Men are carrying Adrien's body on a travois. Suzette chokes back her reaction. Henri walks with the body, eyes red and cried out. He passes Isabelle without looking at her. 
EXT. BLACKSMITH'S COTTAGE - DAY 
Henri hammers at a red-hot iron horseshoe. Isabelle enters. Henri doesn't seem to notice. A hesitant beat. 
ISABELLE I heard your father wounded the beast. He was a brave man. 
HENRI Did you hear what it did to him? It chewed off his private parts. Isabelle had not heard this. Henri doesn't stop working. 
HENRI And I did nothing. I was too scared. I couldn't move. I just let my father be eaten alive. She moves toward him, but he shrugs her away. 
HENRI No. I don't want you here. Isabelle gives him a sad look, then leaves. Henri just keeps hammering away on the anvil. 
EXT. CHURCH - DAY 
A coffin is lowered into a grave. Father Auguste blesses it. Henri stands at his side. Isabelle is here with Roxanne. Lucrece eyes Isabelle, then whispers to her: 
LUCRECE I thought your mother would be here. They used to be quite close. Isabelle gives her a sharp look, but Lucrece says nothing more. Isabelle looks down at the coffin with a sudden realization... 
EXT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - DAY 
Suzette is soaking clothes in a bucket of lye, crying as she works. Isabelle approaches. Suzette quickly wipes her eyes. A beat. Isabelle gathers her nerve, then: 
ISABELLE You told me you had a sweetheart before you were married. It was Henri's father, wasn't it? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Suzette freezes. She faces Isabelle, but doesn't answer. 
ISABELLE Lucie was in love with Henri. She could have married him. (off Suzette's look) Couldn't she have? 
SUZETTE We arranged for you to marry him. 
ISABELLE But you gained the same no matter which one of us married him. So why did it have to be me? 
SUZETTE I think you know the answer to that question. 
ISABELLE No. You say it. Suzette's eyes well up. Then: 
SUZETTE Lucie was Henri's half-sister. She was not your father's daughter. Isabelle suddenly looks ill. Reluctant, she asks: 
ISABELLE Am I? Do you even know? 
SUZETTE Yes. I was already pregnant when your father and I married. 
ISABELLE Does he know? 
SUZETTE No. And he must never know. Tears spill down Isabelle's cheeks. She walks away. 
SUZETTE Isabelle! 
SOLOMON We lived in a village not unlike this place. And not unlike this place, our village was plagued by a werewolf. I went out with some men to hunt it. It never even occurred to me that we might actually find it. But we did. He has everyone's attention now. All eyes are on him. 
SOLOMON It attacked me. All I saw were yellow teeth. I hacked at it with an axe and suddenly it was gone. There was blood on my axe. I had cut off one of its paws. I picked it up and put it in my sack. 
(BEAT) When I returned home in the morning, I found my wife with a bloody rag tied around her left wrist. And when I opened my sack, the werewolf's paw was gone. This is what I found in its place. Solomon takes an old leather sack from his belt, reaches inside... and pulls out a WOMAN'S MUMMIFIED HAND wearing a wedding ring. There are gasps from the crowd. 
SOLOMON Her name was PÃ©nÃ©lope. She was very pretty. And we were very happy. Until the day I killed her. Solomon turns and gives Attewater a hard look. 
SOLOMON Your werewolf is still alive. And I promise you, it will kill again. 
INT. MANOR HOUSE - GREAT HALL - NIGHT 
Soldiers stand at every door. Solomon and Attewater sit in front of the gathered Villagers. Solomon's Captain stands behind him. Isabelle nervously notes that the Captain wears a spiked flail. The black iron ball is shaped like a skull with spikes coming out of it. 
SOLOMON I have examined the body of your blacksmith. There were bruises on his neck from where the beast held him in its jaws, squeezing his throat so that he could not scream. 
CESAIRE But he did scream. We all heard him. 
SOLOMON Only when it wanted you to. It used him as bait to lure you into the bit of theater it had prepared. 
HENRI Theater? My father is not playacting. He is dead. 
REEVE And I killed the beast that did it. 
SOLOMON That's what it wants you to think. It did kill your blacksmith. But the animal that you killed was not the werewolf. 
REEVE There was blood dripping from its teeth. 
SOLOMON The blood was its own. The werewolf most likely wounded it earlier in the evening and left it in the cave for you to find and kill. 
CESAIRE 'Most likely,' he says. Have you ever heard anything more unlikely in your lives? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: The Villagers laugh. Lucrece eyes them, disapproving. 
ATTEWATER Your Eminence, if what you say is true, that we were somehow fooled by this thing, it could not have done so without foreknowledge of our plan to hunt it. 
SOLOMON That's correct. The werewolf does not live in the forest as you have rather naÃ¯vely assumed. It lives here in the village. Among you. There is a moment of shocked silence. Then mounting anger. Cesaire stands up and gestures to Henri. 
CESAIRE You come here and tell us that this boy's father died for nothing. You accuse us and call us fools. Well, I believe what I can see with my own eyes. That wolf is dead. And I know it's dead because I was with the brave men who killed it. 
MERCHANT And what of the festival? 
ATTEWATER The festival was to celebrate the death of the Wolf. 
MERCHANT And we say that it's dead! We've spent every full moon for the past forty years cowering in our homes. We've earned a celebration. 
REEVE And paid for it in blood! Attewater gives Solomon a nervous look. Solomon shrugs. 
SOLOMON Have your festival. I will stay on here until then to ensure that you have the celebration you all so richly deserve. The Villagers seem appeased, especially the smug Merchant. A look passes between Solomon and his Captain. Isabelle catches it... and finds it unsettling. 
EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - DAY 
The moon sign displays the angry full moon, but it has been decorated with ribbons and mistletoe. Despite the cold, the mood in the village is happy and excited. 
INT. CHURCH - DAY 
Solomon is anointing each of his Soldiers with holy water from a basin held by Father Auguste... 
SOLOMON Gloria Patri, et Filio, et Spiritui Sancto. Sicut erat in principio, et nunc, et sempter, et in saecula saeculorum. Amen. 
INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - COMMON ROOM - DAY 
Isabelle wears her best dress, her hair decorated with ribbons. Cesaire is asleep, a flask in his hand. Suzette knits. 
ISABELLE I'm going to the festival. 
SUZETTE All right then. She doesn't look up from her knitting. Isabelle leaves. 
PETER I thought being with Rosemaria would be the one thing you would never be able to forgive. I wanted you to hate me. (off her look) Isabelle, you are the best thing that could ever happen to me. And I am the worst thing that could ever happen to you. 
ISABELLE How could you think that? 
PETER I wasn't born here. You and I both know what that means. I will always be a stranger to these people. Your parents will never let us be together. 
ISABELLE That means less to me now than ever. We can leave here. We can go someplace where we'll both be strangers. 
PETER I can't let you do that. You have something here that I will never have. You have a place. You have 
(MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
PETER (CONT'D) a family. With Henri you have a future. I'm not going to let you ruin that over me. 
ISABELLE The only life I want is with you. 
PETER Isabelle... I'm wrong for you. 
ISABELLE I know you are. I just don't care. She kisses him on the mouth, then quickly steps back, as if she did it before she could change her mind. Then he takes her in his arms and they kiss, long and hard. 
INT. BARN - DUSK 
A door opens and Peter and Isabelle enter, still kissing. He closes the door, pushes her against it with his body. He lowers her to pile of straw in an empty stall. She looks up at him, surprised, then pulls him tightly to her, kissing him hard. She grabs his hand and guides it to her breast. Now Peter looks surprised. He hesitates. 
ISABELLE I don't want to wait. 
PETER But not like this. 
(A BEAT) I want to marry you. She searches his face and sees that he's serious. 
PETER I can pack the cart tonight and we can leave in the morning. (off her look) Is that too soon? 
ISABELLE It's not soon enough. She pulls him to her and kisses him. 
EXT. BARN - DUSK 
Peter looks outside. The coast is clear. He and Isabelle slip out and close the door behind them. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
PETER You'd better get back before someone misses you. She gives him a lingering kiss. When she pulls away from him, he sees that she's crying. 
PETER What's wrong? 
ISABELLE This feels like a dream. I'm afraid if I leave you I might wake up. He kisses her and holds her tight. Neither of them notice Henri, angrily watching from the shadows... 
EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - NIGHT 
Isabelle returns to the festival. She sits next to Roxanne, who notices a piece of straw in Isabelle's hair. Isabelle quickly brushes it away, embarrassed. Isabelle's eyes go to the sky. The sun has finally set. The moon has risen, silver and full. Isabelle gazes up at it, transfixed. Roxanne looks over at her, curious. 
ISABELLE I've never seen it full before... Suddenly -- the CHURCH BELLS start to ring. Everyone falls silent. Confused looks all around. Then, somewhere in the dark... ... a WOLF HOWLS. The Villagers gasp. A WOMAN screams. People start to panic. Claude is knocked down. 
ROXANNE Claude! Then something massive pushes its way through the surging crowd, bursting from the darkness... It's THE WOLF. The Villagers gape in horror. It makes the wolf that they killed look like a chihuahua. But there's something about its face that isn't canine at all, but ghoulishly human as it HOWLS at the moon. Suddenly, a group of Villagers throw off their cloaks, revealing themselves to be Solomon's armored Soldiers. Each of them draws a gleaming sword and points it at the Wolf. They've been lying in wait and now they have it surrounded. The Wolf SNARLS at them. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: A moment later, Father Solomon gallops into the square on his armored steed, wearing a helmet adorned with a golden eagle. He tugs the reins and his horse rears back. 
SOLOMON Get to the church, you fools! The Wolf SNARLS up at him. Solomon gives a battle cry: 
SOLOMON 
DIE, BEAST! AND LONG LIVE GOD'S 
CONTINUED: 
ISABELLE What big eyes you have... 
THE WOLF The better to see you with, my dear. 
ISABELLE Are you going to kill us? 
THE WOLF Kill you? Why would I kill you? 
ISABELLE Then what do you want? 
THE WOLF I want you, Isabelle. Isabelle gapes, dumbstruck and dismayed. 
THE WOLF We are the same, you and I. We are both wild things. You show one face to the world, but there is another face that you hide. A fire burning inside you, waiting to be released. The Wolf sniffs her, starting at her feet and working its way up. It SNARLS with satisfaction, savoring her scent. 
THE WOLF Yes. I can smell it on you even now. Suddenly, the Wolf jumps onto its hind legs, puts its forepaws on the wall on either side of Isabelle, its muzzle only inches from her face. She recoils. 
THE WOLF Leave with me tonight. Run with me. The only shackles binding you are of your own making. Slip them and I can show you the world and every pleasure in it. Isabelle hesitates, then finds the strength to speak: 
ISABELLE I don't know who you are, but we are not the same. I would rather die than go with you. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
THE WOLF What about your fat friend here? Do you think she would rather die? (off Isabelle's look) Come away with me. Or I will kill her. And I will keep killing until you agree to leave with me. Suddenly, the sound of MEN SHOUTING. The Wolf leans in, SNARLING. Isabelle turns away from its foul breath. 
THE WOLF Choose now. Quickly. Isabelle trembles. She looks down at Roxanne's terrified face, torn. Isabelle closes her eyes. She can't do it. 
THE WOLF Your silence has doomed them all. Just then, Solomon and two Soldiers turn the corner. The Wolf leaps atop the wall and growls down at Isabelle: 
THE WOLF Come the next full moon, their blood will be on your hands. Then it jumps over the wall. Solomon scrabbles up after it, but the Wolf is already too far away. It looks back at him. A silent challenge passes between them. And then the Wolf is gone. 
INT. CHURCH - NIGHT 
Solomon and his Soldiers bring Isabelle and Roxanne inside. A crowd of panicked Villagers swarms to Solomon. 
SOLOMON We are safe here. God protects his own house and those within it. Isabelle finds Prudence. 
ISABELLE Is Peter here? 
PRUDENCE Peter? I don't think so. 
ISABELLE What about Claude? Or my parents? 
PRUDENCE I haven't seen any of them. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
ISABELLE Would you look for them? Please? Prudence nods and rushes off. Roxanne slumps in a corner, a dazed look on her face. A beat. 
ROXANNE You talked to it. 
ISABELLE It talked to us. A chill runs down Roxanne's spine. A long beat. 
ROXANNE No. It only growled. (off Isabelle's look) You heard it talk to you? Isabelle doesn't know what to say. She glances around to see if anyone has overheard. Then: 
ISABELLE Do not speak of this to anyone. Roxanne nods, but eyes Isabelle warily. Isabelle turns away, afraid and confused. 
EXT. CHURCH - DAWN 
Silence. The door CREAKS open and the Merchant peers out. A blanket of new snow covers the village. It's as if the massacre of the night before never happened. 
INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - COMMON ROOM - DAWN 
Isabelle hurries inside. Embers burn in the fire pit. A chair has been overturned. The room is empty. 
Solomon places his silver sword on the table in front of Attewater and Father Auguste. 
SOLOMON Silver. This is our most potent weapon. One blow will kill it. 
(BEAT) That sword has tasted the blood of many such creatures. But never one as powerful as this. 
ATTEWATER If it's that powerful, how can we possibly hope to stop it? 
SOLOMON We must find it in its human form. Who among you do you suspect? Attewater and Father Auguste trade uncomfortable looks. Neither of them wants to speak up first. 
SOLOMON It has not survived this long by being obvious. The signs will be subtle. Insomnia. Restlessness. Strange behavior. Strange smells. (off their looks) Well, none of them smell good, but we must start somewhere. 
FATHER AUGUSTE What about the hair Madame Ordeville found on Lucie's body? It was dark. The person we are looking for must have dark hair. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
SOLOMON Perhaps. Unless it planted the hair to make us think that. 
ATTEWATER Yes, it's trying to trick us again. This has been happening for forty years. It must be an old man by now. The hair should have been gray. 
SOLOMON Not necessarily. It may be the child or grandchild of the werewolf that first struck here. 
FATHER AUGUSTE The curse is hereditary? 
SOLOMON It is. But it effects men and women differently. A man can inherit the curse. Or he can be turned simply by being bitten. Solomon turns toward the fire and stares into it. 
SOLOMON But women are immune to the werewolf's bite. In order for a woman to be turned, she must inherit the curse. But even then it will lie dormant unless she eats human flesh. Only then will the bite of a male werewolf change her. Only then can she become a werewolf and capable of passing the curse on to her own children. 
ATTEWATER But it could be a woman. 
SOLOMON Of course. It could be any one of you. Attewater and Father Auguste exchange a wary look. 
EXT. VILLAGE - CROSSROADS - DAWN 
The mood of the village is grim. Isabelle meets Roxanne at the crossroads. Roxanne eyes her warily. A beat. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
ISABELLE Has Claude come home? 
ROXANNE No. Nobody has seen him. 
ISABELLE He's run away before. He'll be all right. Roxanne nods, unconvinced. Prudence joins them. They all exchange a sad look. 
PRUDENCE Well. I suppose this is all of us. The three of them turn and start toward the woods... 
INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT 
Isabelle and Grandmother sit by the fire. 
GRANDMOTHER It talked to you. And you understood it? 
ISABELLE As clearly as I do you now. Grandmother fixes her with a serious look. A beat. 
GRANDMOTHER Word of this cannot be allowed to spread. Do you understand me? 
ISABELLE Roxanne will never speak of it. She won't even talk to me about it. A long beat. Isabelle is working up her nerve. Then: 
ISABELLE I have to do what it wants. (off her look) I have communed with an unholy beast. What does that make me if not cursed? 
GRANDMOTHER I don't know. But I won't allow you to go with this devil and live as its concubine. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
SOLOMON You say you saw the accused perform magic? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
LUCRECE In broad daylight with my own eyes. Everyone here has seen it. 
SOLOMON So it was common knowledge that the accused was a conjurer? 
LUCRECE Yes, Your Eminence. I saw it for the Devil's work, but they laughed at me and paid him money. Isabelle and Grandmother exchange a concerned look. Through a SERIES OF CUTS, more witnesses are questioned: 
FATHER AUGUSTE shifts uncomfortably as Solomon interrogates him... 
SOLOMON Are you aware that it is the custom of witches and devil worshippers to hold their black sabbaths in cemeteries? 
FATHER AUGUSTE Yes, Your Eminence. 
SOLOMON And do you know of their practice of dancing with invisible devils during these rituals? 
FATHER AUGUSTE I have heard it said so, yes. 
SOLOMON Is there one here today who you have seen dancing in your cemetery? 
FATHER AUGUSTE (hesitant; a beat) Yes. But I don't believe he meant anything by it. It was in jest. 
SOLOMON So you consider the black mass to be a jest? There are suspicious WHISPERS among the Villagers. Father Auguste eyes them nervously. A beat. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
FATHER AUGUSTE No, of course not. 
SOLOMON Then point him out. Father Auguste reluctantly points to Claude. 
MARGUERITE Roxanne weeps as her mother testifies against Claude. 
SOLOMON What is your relationship to the accused? 
MARGUERITE I am his mother. 
SOLOMON And where is his father? 
MARGUERITE I don't know, sir. 
SOLOMON Well, what is his name? She pauses. The crowd eyes her, disapproving. A beat. 
MARGUERITE I never learned his name, sir. 
SOLOMON You say a man whose name you cannot recall is the father of your child? What can you tell us about him? 
MARGUERITE Not much, sir. She lowers her eyes, ashamed. Solomon considers her. 
SOLOMON Almost as if it were a dream? (off her look) Certain devils called incubi can collect human semen and then transfer it to women as they sleep. A woman who unwittingly conceives in this manner would not be a whore. She would be blameless in the eyes of God. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Marguerite's eyes spark, suddenly hopeful... 
SOLOMON You remember almost nothing of the man who impregnated you. Is it not possible that there was no man? That the accused is not the product of your own sin, but the foul offspring of a werewolf whose semen was placed in you by an incubus while you slept? 
MARGUERITE Yes! Yes, I remember now! He came to me in my sleep! It wasn't my fault! God save me, it wasn't my fault! Roxanne buries her face in her hands. 
INT. MANOR HOUSE - GREAT HALL - DAY (LATER) 
Solomon addresses the gathered Villagers. 
SOLOMON We have proven here today that behind this veil of feigned idiocy is the fiend that has plagued your village. However, in order for the sentence of death to be carried out, the Church requires either a confession or the testimony of a witness who has seen the accused in his transformed state. Since the accused has refused to confess, this court calls upon its final witness. Isabelle Ordeville. Isabelle is stunned. All eyes turn toward her. 
CONTINUED: 
SOLOMON Enough of this. Let's eat. He gestures to the Scribe, who hands Attewater a document. 
ATTEWATER What is this? 
SOLOMON A statement declaring that you heard the boy confess. All it requires is your signature. Or your mark, if you cannot write. 
ATTEWATER But he has not confessed. How could he have? Solomon studies Attewater. A beat. Solomon shrugs. 
SOLOMON Very well. Listen more carefully this time. He gestures for the Soldiers to throw more wood on the fire. The FLAMES leap higher. Attewater goes pale. All he hears are screams. Solomon stands next to the bull. The flames gleam off the brass, casting him in hellfire. 
SOLOMON Listen to how he sings of his love of Satan. How he despairs that he will never again copulate with the dead or sink his teeth into the flesh of pregnant women and eat their unborn children. Attewater gives Solomon a horrified look, suddenly realizing. Father Solomon is insane. 
ATTEWATER Stop this. 
SOLOMON No. You stop it. (off his look) We both know he is guilty. But I cannot legally execute him without a witness or a confession. Sign this and we have a confession. Attewater glares at Solomon, then angrily signs the document. Solomon gestures to his Soldiers, who open the bull and pull Claude out. Attewater has to look away. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) Suddenly, Solomon grabs Attewater by his collar, drags him across the room, and forces him to look at Claude. Thankfully, we do not see him, except in deep f.g. His naked flesh is actually smoking. Attewater cringes. 
SOLOMON This is the business of werewolf hunting and you had best develop a stomach for it. Because where there is one werewolf, there are two. And where there are two, there are more. 
(BEAT) This is only the beginning. Solomon throws him to the floor and leaves. Attewater trembles helplessly as Claude is dragged out of the room. 
INT. MANOR HOUSE - GREAT HALL - NIGHT 
Solomon is eating dinner. The Captain enters. 
CAPTAIN A girl to see you. 
SOLOMON Well, I've yet to come across a girl I wouldn't at least look at. The Captain ushers Roxanne inside. She meekly steps forward. A beat. 
SOLOMON I assume you came here with a purpose. She hurriedly empties Marguerite's purse on the table in front of Solomon. A mere handful of coins. 
ROXANNE I would like to bargain for the release of my brother. 
SOLOMON Your brother has just confessed. 
ROXANNE What? That's not possible! 
SOLOMON It has been witnessed and notarized. He will hang in the morning. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Roxanne stands frozen, gathering her courage for what she is about to say. Realizing that she has no choice. 
ROXANNE I have more than money to offer you. She raises a trembling hand and starts to open her bodice, but Solomon interrupts. 
SOLOMON What do you think you are doing? (off her look) Do you have any idea who I am? I am the Witchfinder General. I have fought in the Holy Land. I have waded hip deep in blood and resisted all the temptations of the infidels. And you seek to stay the hand of justice with such a tawdry bribe? Leave here, girl, before I have you whipped. Solomon gestures for the Soldiers and they forcibly drag her away. Roxanne struggles against them. 
ROXANNE Wait! I have something else! I know the name of a witch! Solomon looks up sharply. The Soldiers stop. Solomon crosses the room and stands glaring down at Roxanne. She cringes. This is the hardest decision of her life... 
ROXANNE Spare my brother and I will tell you her name. 
INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - VARIOUS - NIGHT 
SMASH! Isabelle and her parents are jolted from their sleep by Soldiers barging into their home. One of them climbs into the loft and yanks Isabelle out of bed. Cesaire leaps to his feet, but is viciously beaten down. Suzette screams. The Soldiers drag Isabelle away. 
INT. MANOR HOUSE - DUNGEON CELL - NIGHT 
Isabelle is thrown to the floor, the door SLAMMED behind her. She huddles against the wall, shivering. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Then: A low MOAN in the dark. Isabelle startles. She looks up, her eyes going wide in disgust and horror... It's Claude. He's locked in a man-shaped cage, his body covered with hideous burns. He moans again. Isabelle chokes back her disgust and goes to him. She lightly takes his hand, shaken to her soul at the sight of him. 
INT. MANOR HOUSE - GREAT HALL - DAY 
INT. MANOR HOUSE - DUNGEON CELL - NIGHT 
Isabelle stands at the barred door. Grandmother is on the other side. They speak in furtive whispers. 
GRANDMOTHER I'm not going to let these worthless shits sacrifice you to save themselves. We have to find the real werewolf before tomorrow night. 
ISABELLE That's impossible. Even Father Solomon doesn't have the first clue. 
GRANDMOTHER Father Solomon doesn't know the things that I know. (off Isabelle's look) I am the oldest person in this village who was here when the Wolf first came. I remember the old days. And what is happening now is much worse. 
ISABELLE What was it like in the old days? 
GRANDMOTHER The Wolf never used to attack in the open like it did at the festival. It's a coward at heart. It would kill whole families in their homes, but it always stayed in the shadows. It never would have shown itself in the old days. 
ISABELLE It's grown bold. 
GRANDMOTHER Or perhaps it made a mistake. 
(BEAT) You're at the center of this. At least two of the victims can be tied to you. What if it had to kill so many at the festival to hide the fact that the first two killings weren't random? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Isabelle considers this. A beat as she realizes... 
ISABELLE But who would want to kill Lucie? 
GRANDMOTHER Your parents said that the Wolf broke into the house and took Lucie. We both know that's not true. What really happened? Isabelle hesitates, reluctant. 
ISABELLE My mother made me swear I would never speak of it. 
(BEAT) Lucie went to the Wolf willingly. Grandmother reacts, horrified. 
GRANDMOTHER Why would you think such a thing? 
ISABELLE She was in love with Henri. 
GRANDMOTHER She took her own life over a boy? 
ISABELLE What other explanation is there? Grandmother thinks. The pieces are fitting together... 
EXT. STABLE - NIGHT 
Grandmother knocks on a door. Henri answers. 
GRANDMOTHER Hello, Henri. 
INT. STABLE - NIGHT 
Henri is in the midst of shoeing a horse. Grandmother stands by the door, watching him. 
GRANDMOTHER You spoke up very loudly in Isabelle's defense today. That was very brave. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
HENRI I just said what I felt. 
GRANDMOTHER You're under no obligation to stand in her defense. You broke off your engagement to her. 
HENRI I never stopped caring about her. I would do anything for Isabelle. 
GRANDMOTHER As her sister would have done anything for you. (off his look) Lucie was in love with you. But you knew that, didn't you? 
HENRI I had no control over the way she felt. 
GRANDMOTHER She kept it secret from almost everyone. Even Isabelle didn't know. Did you tell anyone? 
HENRI Never. 
CESAIRE Will you want a ride into town tomorrow? To say goodbye to her? 
GRANDMOTHER Yes. First thing in the morning. He nods shakily and leaves. She closes the door behind him and lets the faÃ§ade of calm fall from her face. She puts a trembling hand to her mouth, mind racing... 
EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - DAWN 
The Villagers go about their daily activities, but nobody speaks. The Herald hangs the full moon sign. 
HERALD Full moon! Full moon! Full moon! 
EXT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - DAWN 
Morning sunlight glints off the frozen brook. A flock of CROWS are startled from their roosts and take flight. 
INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - DAWN 
Grandmother sits at the table, writing a letter in Latin with a quill. She doesn't notice the veil that separates her bedchamber rippling, as if in a gentle breeze... Suddenly, she hears MOVEMENT. She looks up. The veil is still. She stands and pokes the ashes of the fire with her cane, her back to the veil... ... and changes her grip on the cane. To wield it as a weapon. Glancing back, she sees the veil move again... Suddenly, she whirls around and swings her cane at the veil, sweeping through it three times without hitting anything. A beat. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
GRANDMOTHER Show yourself! Coward! Another beat. The veil settles and is still. Then: A FIGURE lunges out of the veil with its arms reaching out at us. It grabs Grandmother's throat in one hand and wrestles the cane from her grip with the other. She struggles, but she's far too weak for her attacker. The Figure whips out a knife. Grandmother sees it, but can do nothing. The knife flashes. Fat drops of blood splash on the floor. Then the Figure drops Grandmother and she crumples, lifeless. A pool of blood slowly spreads out from underneath her. The Figure steps over the widening pool and picks up the letter Grandmother was writing. He quickly scans it and angrily tosses it in the fire... Then he hears something. FOOTSTEPS, crunching through the snow. He hurries to the window and peers out... It's Roxanne and Prudence. Roxanne looks like hell, but here for lessons as usual. The Figure ducks out of sight. A moment later, they're KNOCKING on the door. Their feet are visible under the crack. The Figure sidles alongside the door, BREATHING heavily. Another KNOCK. On the floor inside, the pool of blood is expanding toward the door... The Figure sees it. He puts a hand on the hilt of his knife... then whispers to the girls through the door, disguising his voice with a dry, old woman's rasp: 
THE FIGURE Go away. Outside, Roxanne and Prudence exchange a curious look. 
PRUDENCE Are you all right? 
THE FIGURE I'm sick. You can't come in. 
PRUDENCE You sound awful. Would you like us to make you something? 
THE FIGURE No. You mustn't come in. Go home, now. I want to sleep. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) The blood is flowing right toward the door. In about thirty seconds, the girls will be standing in it. Outside, Prudence and Roxanne exchange a look... ... then turn and walk away. The Figure breathes a sigh of relief and takes his hand away from the knife. But then Roxanne stops. And looks back. The Figure secretly watches from the window. Roxanne walks back to the cottage. The blood is about to run under the door. The Figure grabs the door handle and readies the knife. Roxanne stands on the doorstep. 
ROXANNE Are you sure you don't want us to bring you something? 
THE FIGURE No, my dear. Come back tomorrow. The blood is seconds away from hitting her feet. The Figure stands poised to throw open the door... but at the last instant, Roxanne turns and walks away. She doesn't see the blood pour outside under the door behind her. 
INT. MANOR HOUSE - DUNGEON CELL - DAY 
Isabelle has fallen asleep on the bed of straw. She's startled awake by the sound of her CELL DOOR opening. It's Father Auguste. 
FATHER AUGUSTE I've come to hear your final confession. Isabelle nods shakily and sits up. He enters. 
ISABELLE Has there been any word from my grandmother? 
FATHER AUGUSTE None that I have heard. Why? Isabelle doesn't answer. She turns away, troubled... 
EXT. MANOR HOUSE - DAY 
Peter anxiously waits outside, half-hidden in a copse of trees. A SERVANT BOY runs up to him from the house. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
SERVANT BOY She's still in the dungeon. They're going to move her at sunset. Peter tosses the Boy a coin. The Boy runs off. Peter looks at the stone house, his eyes hard and determined... 
INT. MANOR HOUSE - CORRIDOR - DAY 
Attewater walks with Father Solomon. 
ATTEWATER We've hanged the werewolf. Why not let the girl go free? 
SOLOMON I told you, Bailiff. Where there is one werewolf, there are more. And the girl is the bait for our trap. Father Solomon strides off. Attewater watches him go... 
CONTINUED: 
SOLOMON (CONT'D) Flour, by your own confession, have committed acts of vulgar heresy, convict you of the sins of witches and condemn you to the mercy of werewolf. This is the sentence given. Solomon walks away and Attewater reluctantly follows. Through the holes in the mask, Isabelle sees Father Auguste make the sign of the cross and sadly turn away. 
ISABELLE Help... Father Auguste stops. The Villagers shift uncomfortably as her helpless voice calls out from inside the mask. 
ISABELLE Help me... Please... Help me... The Villagers start to leave, ashamed. Isabelle sees them going... and suddenly SCREAMS. 
ISABELLE 
HELP ME! PLEASE! WHY WON'T 
SOMEBODY HELP ME?! The Villagers startle. She SCREAMS again, struggling against the stocks. But no one comes to her aid. 
INT. ROXANNE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - BEDROOM - DUSK 
Isabelle's SCREAMS can be heard from here. Roxanne lies in her bed, sobbing her heart out... 
EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - DUSK (LATER) 
Almost everyone has left. Isabelle slumps in the stocks, silent and exhausted. Father Auguste sadly walks away, leaving only Prudence. She nervously approaches. 
PRUDENCE Isabelle? Can you hear me? 
ISABELLE I can hear you. 
PRUDENCE Roxanne wanted you to know how sorry she is. She only said those things to save her brother. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
ISABELLE I know. Will you tell her that I forgive her? 
PRUDENCE Of course. 
(BEAT) I wanted to say... I don't know what to say. 
ISABELLE You don't have to say anything. 
PRUDENCE I want to. 
(BEAT) I want you to know that you may have fooled Roxanne, but you don't fool me. Not anymore. You were always too good. Too pretty. Nobody could be as perfect as you. You tricked us. And now you're going to get what you deserve. A beat. Isabelle responds, surprisingly gentle: 
ISABELLE I think you'd better go now. Prudence looks up. The sun has almost set. 
PRUDENCE Yes. It won't be long now. 
ACROSS THE SQUARE The Captain crouches in the shadows of a nearby barn. He watches Prudence leave. Solomon and Attewater join him. 
SOLOMON No one shoots until I give the order. Attewater glances outside and sees Soldiers armed with longbows hidden all around the square. The Captain draws an arrow from his quiver. It's tip is made of silver. 
EXT. VILLAGE - OUTSKIRTS - NIGHT 
The streets are empty. The FULL MOON has risen... 
EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - VARIOUS - NIGHT 
Isabelle is now alone. The streets are empty. Around the square, Soldiers stand in tense silence, ready with arrows strung on their bows. Attewater shifts nervously. Suddenly: a long, ululating HOWL. Isabelle gasps. The Soldiers ready their bows. Attewater shrinks back. Another HOWL. Closer now. Isabelle tries to pull her hands out of the stocks. Then: Solomon spots something. 
SOLOMON There. The Captain and Attewater follow his look. A BLACK SHAPE is stealing through the shadows toward Isabelle... 
SOLOMON Hold your fire... Isabelle frantically tries to free herself, her wrists torn and bleeding, but it's no use. Then, suddenly -- -- something SLAMS into the stocks. BANG! She can't see what it is. The stocks are hit again. Isabelle screams. Suddenly, the Shape moves into her field of view: 
HENRI (O.S.) Hey! Stop it! It's me! Isabelle's eyes go wide. The Black Shape crouches and looks in at Isabelle through the eyeholes. It's Henri. 
ISABELLE Get away from me! 
HENRI I'm not the Wolf! The moon is out! Look, I haven't turned! Isabelle realizes. He's right. It couldn't be him. 
ISABELLE You're not the Wolf. You can't be... 
CESAIRE Look into my eyes. The one part of me I can never change. Isabelle looks into his eyes... and recoils in horror. 
ISABELLE Oh, dear God... You killed Lucie? You killed my sister? 
CESAIRE I did more than that to her. Isabelle steps away from him, mind reeling. He snarls. 
CESAIRE I only wish your mother could have known what I did to her. The girl she passed off as my daughter. 
EXT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK) 
The night of the festival. SCREAMS can be heard coming from the village square. Suzette runs outside... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
CESAIRE (V.O.) I was made a cuckold by your mother. But I paid her back. She hears a LOW GROWL. She turns, startled. It's the Wolf. It lunges at her, raking her face with its claws. 
EXT. WOODS - NIGHT (FLASHBACK) 
The wolf hunt. Adrien hears SOMETHING move in the brush. He looks toward it... and sees the Wolf staring at him from the darkness. 
CESAIRE (V.O.) I paid her lover back, too. 
BACK TO SCENE To Isabelle's dismay, Cesaire has tears in his eyes. 
CESAIRE Lucie was the joy of my life. But she wasn't mine. 
ISABELLE Yes, she was. In every way that matters, she was. 
CESAIRE No. Not in every way that matters. My father sired me. I am a werewolf because it was in his blood. Because I was his. 
ISABELLE Did Grandmother know? 
CESAIRE No. And neither does your mother. 
INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - DUSK (FLASHBACK) 
The night Lucie died. Cesaire pours mugs of beer, but this time we see him sprinkle something in the beer before serving it -- Grandmother's sleeping herb. 
CESAIRE (V.O.) I put an herb in the beer to make you sleep whenever the moon was full. One of your Grandmother's old remedies. 
EXT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - DUSK (FLASHBACK) 
Many years ago. Grandmother is in her 40s, asleep in a chair, holding an empty cup. Isabelle's GRANDFATHER takes the cup from her hand and quietly leaves. Grandmother sleeps peacefully by the fire... 
CESAIRE (V.O.) That's how my father got away with it. Your grandmother never learned the truth. Until last night. 
EXT. DARK FOREST - NIGHT (FLASHBACK) 
Still many years ago. A werewolf runs through the woods... followed by a smaller werewolf. 
CESAIRE (V.O.) I began to turn when I was fourteen. My father and I ran together. We hunted freely. Killing at will. The two werewolves are chasing a FRIGHTENED PEASANT, moving in for the kill... 
EXT. DARK FOREST - DAY (FLASHBACK) 
The mangled body of the Peasant has been discovered. A group of MEN stands around it. 
CESAIRE (V.O.) Our only mistake was that we gorged ourselves too often on the fat flesh of the villagers. 
EXT. DARK FOREST - NIGHT (FLASHBACK) 
The two werewolves are running through the woods again, this time chased by VILLAGERS with torches and weapons. 
CESAIRE They killed my father. Suddenly, the larger werewolf falls into a pit filled with sharp stakes. It CRIES OUT in agony. The smaller werewolf looks down and WHIMPERS... ... watching as the larger werewolf begins to change before our eyes. It's reverting to its human form...

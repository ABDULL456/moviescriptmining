Scene #12, Interior, Day, Dining Room 
1    ED - W 
Something evil is lurking deep withing the wooded moun- tains of Tennessee, and the camera takes its point of view. Rising from a swampy bog, the mud slides from view allowing it to see early morning mist hanging about the forest. Creeping silently past trees, gliding over small shrubs, it moves onward through the woods until a mammoth oak rests directly in its path. The tree is uprooted by this unseen force, and falls with a deafening crash. 
2    ED - CAR 
Near by, a stretch of highway curves along the base of a mountain. The road winds off into oblivion beyond other peaks. From behind view, the rumble of an engine can be heard. It is a large logging truck headed south. Moving away, the truck becomes smaller until finally it disap- pears in the distance. From where the truck emerged, a dilapidated gold 1973 Oldsmobile comes into view. 
3    ID - CAR 
Inside, five people can be seen. They are couples ASHLY and LINDA, SCOTT and SHELLY, and CHERYL, ASHLY's sister. Both SCOTT and SHELLY wear "Michigan State" T-shirts, and are students along with the others at that univer- sity. SCOTT is driving and SHELLY sits next to him up front. ASHLY, LINDA and CHERYL are in back. They listen to an old "Baby Moses And The Thrillers" song on the radio, and SHELLY is slapping the dash board as if it were a drum. 
SHELLY 
(Singing with the music)... Together, forever... 
SCOTT 
Ash, where are we? 
ASHLY 
Scotty, watch out! 
8    ED - CAR 
The truck races closer. 
9    ID - CAR 
Their steering wheel is locked. 
ASHLY 
Turn! 
10   ED - CAR 
At the last possible instant, SCOTT's wheel again can be controlled, and the car swerves sharply back into its own lane. 
11   ED - CAR 
The truck speeds harmlessly past them. 
12   ID - CAR 
ASHLY 
Damn it Scott, what the hell was that? You trying to kill us? 
SCOTT 
Don't yell at me, it's your lousy steering wheel. The damn thing jerked right out of my hand. 
ASHLY 
I can't understand it. I just had this thing in for a tune-up. 
SHELLY 
Radio's dead too, ace. 
ASHLY 
And I just had 'em tune up the whole thing yesterday. 
SCOTT 
Well, then take it back 'cause the damn thing don't work. Only thing that works on the whole car is the lousy horn. 
SCOTT 
Well, the guy that's renting it says it's an old place, little run down, but it's right up in the mountains- totally secluded. (He takes a drink from the bottle) Best part is, we get it so cheap. 
LINDA 
Why are we getting it so cheap? 
SCOTT 
I don't know, might be in real bad shape. 
CHERYL 
You mean nobody's seen this place yet? 
SCOTT 
Not yet. 
ASHLY 
Might not be too bad. 
LINDA 
No... 
ASHLY 
Actually, it might be very nice. 
LINDA 
Yeah... 
SHELLY 
It's probably a real pit. 
CHERYL 
I can't believe that we're renting a place for a week-end that nobody's seen. 
SCOTT 
(Mumbling to himself) Jesus Christ, not this again... 
ASHLY and SCOTT laugh out loud. LINDA laughs quietly, and CHERYL lets out an embarassed giggle to herself. 
SHELLY 
(Teasing) Oooh, you're gonna get it Scotty, when you least expect it, you're gonna get it good. 
19   ED - B 
Finally, the car arrives at a wooden bridge extending over a great chasm. Carefully, the vehicle crosses. 
20   ED - CAB 
It is late afternoon when they eventually arrive at their destination. The small wooden cabin is surrounded by thick dark woods. SCOTT shuts off the car but it contin- ues to sputter and backfire. 
21   ID - CAR 
ASHLY reacts to his car. 
ASHLY 
I...I sent 'em a check for the tune-up. but I'm just not paying for it. 
LINDA 
This place is perfect. 
CHERYL 
The woods come awfully close to the house don't they? 
SCOTT 
So what's wrong with the woods, they can't bite ya. 
CHERYL 
It's just a little claustrophobic that's all. 
LINDA 
Well, I think it's beautiful. 
SHELLY 
Me too, it's gonna be a bomb week- end. 
22   ED - CAB 
LINDA is standing in the corner next to the old grand- father clock. She repositions a balance weight, and it begins to tick. 
LINDA 
Ta daaaaaa! 
The others applaud and whistle. LINDA smiles. 
24   ET - CAB 
The cabin is seen from the outside. Twilight has come. 
25   IT - M.R. 
CHERYL sits alone in the living room near the window. She is drawing sketches of the old clock. As she works, the ticking stops unexpectedly. CHERYL puts down her pencil and looks up to the clock. It stands silently in the cor- ner with its hands frozen in position. There is a rust- ling from the woods. CHERYL looks out the window but can see only the trees. Something is moving outside, yet re- mains hidden within the forest. A gust of wind fills the room. CHERYL glances down at her hand. It turns a pale white and begins to shake and jerk about uncontrollably. She stares on incredulously as her hand, guided by some unseen force picks up the pencil and begins to sketch a figure upon her pad. The wind gales through the open window but dies down slowly as her hand completes the drawing. Whatever was at the edge of the woods has now retreated further into them. Her hand loses the pale cast and is now under control once more. CHERYL picks up her pad of paper. The likeness of a book with some form of ancient writing on its cover has been sketched. She looks to the woods which are now silent. A snapping of wood is heard from the cellar. CHERYL quickly turns to the trap door still nailed shut in the floor. Pos- sibly just a mouse, but she fixes her gaze upon it. Another sound, almost like faint breathing comes from the cellar. 
26   IT - K/M.R. 
ASHLY and LINDA enter from the kitchen. ASHLY is drink- ing a beer and moves over to CHERYL. He stands between her and the trap door. 
ASHLY 
What're you drawing Cheryl? 
He picks up the piece of paper. LINDA looks over his shoulder to glance at it. 
CHERYL 
I...I don't know. 
ASHLY 
Is it a bible? 
CHERYL 
No, no it's no bible. (She glances again at the cellar, knowing some- thing is down there) I don't know what it is. 
LINDA 
Well, this one of the clock's not bad. 
LINDA picks up the sketch and walks over to the clock with it a few steps away. She stands comparing it to the real thing with her back to CHERYL and ASHLY. She is only a few inches from the trap door, and CHERYL wants to call out in warning when ASHLY kneels in front of her to speak secretly. 
ASHLY 
(In a whisper) I got it right here. 
Will you stop it? 
LINDA 
Scott, leave her alone will ya? 
SCOTT turns toward LINDA. 
SCOTT 
Will you relax, I'm just kidding around. She can take a joke- 
He stops talking as he hears the trickling of water. He turns to see CHERYL finish pouring a glass of water in his lap. The others laugh. SCOTT is silent for a moment, then begins chuckling to himself. He turns to CHERYL. 
SCOTT 
(Jokingly) I'll get ya. 
With a napkin, he blots the water from his pants. 
SCOTT 
I'll get ya for this Cheryl. 
ASHLY stands with his drink and raises the glass. 
ASHLY 
I'd like to make a toast for all here this evening. As a greek friend of mine once said, "Nis-hat-nis-fert- dis-ruben-tu-tar-im." 
LINDA 
Which means? 
SCOTT 
Party down! 
The laughter is stifled by a loud snap and cracking of wood heard from the main room. 
SCOTT 
What the hell... 
All stand from the table and hurry to the main room. 
29   IN - M.R. 
What melodrama! What courage! A kiss my brave hero. 
SCOTT kisses SHELLY and with flashlight in hand, he descends the narrow steps into the cellars blackness. 
SHELLY 
I, your virgin queen eagerly await the precious moment when you will ascend. 
SCOTT 
Virgin queen?! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha- 
He disappears below the floor. SHELLY, CHERYL, LINDA and ASHLY wait above. 
ASHLY 
(Calling down) Hey Scott, see any- thing? 
There is no answer. 
ASHLY 
Hey Scott!...Scott! 
SHELLY 
He's just kidding around. 
There is silence. 
SHELLY 
Isn't he? 
No sounds come from the cellar. 
ASHLY 
Linda, get me a flashlight. 
LINDA That's the only one we brought up. 
ASHLY spots a lantern on the fireplace mantle. 
ASHLY 
Then get that lantern. 
31   EN - CAB 
It is evening as darkness surrounds the small cabin. 
32   IN - M.R. 
The group sits huddled around the fireplace talking quietly about school. The same bottle of Scotch is passed around. ASHLY is rewinding the tape recorder, and once this is done, he turns it on. The voice of an old man is heard. ASHLY turns to the others who are talking. 
ASHLY 
Shhh, listen to this. 
VOICE 
My name is Julian Knowby. I am a pro- fessor of ancient Egyptian mythology in Dextin university's ancient history department... 
ASHLY 
This is the tape I found downstairs. 
VOICE 
(Continuing)...I am recording this entry from a small cabin in the south- ern mountains of Tennessee. Here, I am staying with my wife for a few weeks so that I may continue my research un- disturbed. Since May, a group of assoc- iate professors and myself have been excavating the ruins of Ca'n Dar. I believe I have made an important find in that area, and thus the reason for this log. With it, I can keep an ac- curate record of translations from my latest find; the first of six, the others still lost, volumes of ancient Sumarian burial practices and rites. Basically, it is a book of do's and don'ts dealing with the deceased en- titled "Naturan Demanto" roughly trans- lated "Book Of The Dead." It is bound in human flesh, and inked with blood of the deceased... 
SCOTT 
Jeez, I'd hate to find out what they used for pens. 
VOICE 
(Continuing)...This particular volume deals with demons and demon resurrect- ion. These are of the Katardi family, meaning those forces believed to inhab- it the jungles and woods of man's do- main. The first few pages that I have translated warn that these demons are dangerous, everpresent, and exist primarily through this book. As legend has it, only the sacred high priests of the Ca'n Dar tribe could posess these books, for they alone could properly control the resurrected de- mons. It is only through the act of reciting the resurrection passage that these demons would be able to posess the living. For many years, it was thought that this legend- 
CHERYL turns off the machine at this point. 
SCOTT 
Hey, what'd you do that for? It was just getting good. 
CHERYL 
I just don't want to hear any more that's all. 
SCOTT 
(Singing) Cheryl's scared, Cheryl's scared. 
ASHLY 
(In a whisper) Shut it off. 
VOICE 
Kanda! 
39   EN - CAB 
The winds howl, and blackbirds fly from their nests, screaming. 
40   IN - M.R. 
CHERYL 
(Louder now) Shut it off. 
ASHLY, hearing her for the first time, turns from the window to CHERYL. She is overwhealmed with fear. 
VOICE 
Kanda! 
41   EN - CAB 
A bolt of lightning strikes very near and its thunder crash is deafening. 
42   IN - M.R. 
CHERYL can no longer control herself. She screams and covers her ears. 
CHERYL 
Shut it offffff! 
The window shatters when a branch from a nearby tree tears through it. ASHLY runs to the tape recorder and turns it off. CHERYL is crying now, and runs to her room. ASHLY turns to SCOTT. 
ASHLY 
Scott, you knew not to play it, I mean...I mean you knew it was upset- ting her. You just don't know when you're carrying something too far. 
SCOTT 
(To SHELLY) C'mon. (Back to ASHLY) Big deal, it's just a joke, shit. 
SCOTT and SHELLY head for their bedroom. SCOTT mumbles to himself along the way. 
SCOTT 
56   IN - M.R. 
From inside, LINDA speaks. 
LINDA 
Cheryl, wanna play some cards? 
CHERYL 
(Turning with a smile) Uh-uh. 
CHERYL turns to face the window again. 
LINDA 
Hey, tomorrow morning, we'll find some way around that cliff into town okay? 
CHERYL 
Okay. 
Outside the window, SCOTT chops more wood for the nights fire. ASHLY turns on the tape recorder to listen with the ear plug. 
VOICE 
March 12th. Suzanne came after me and almost murdered me. My own wife. At first I thought it was a mental or physical disorder because of what had happened to her eyes, but I was only fooling myself. I knew what it was. 
Outside the window, SCOTT continues to chop and gather wood. SHELLY, still engaged in cards with LINDA, holds up one in particular. 
SHELLY 
Okay, guess this card. 
LINDA 
How am I going to know what card that is? 
SHELLY 
Guess, I'm going to see if you're psychic. 
The card is a two of clubs. 
LINDA 
Okaaaay...is it a queen? 
SHELLY 
Oh my God, what suit? 
LINDA 
Diamonds, no wait! I mean hearts! 
SHELLY 
That's right- seven of hearts! 
LINDA 
Hey Ash, did you see that? I guessed two cards in a row. 
ASHLY 
(Still not paying attention) How do you do it Linda? 
He is concentrating on the tape. 
VOICE 
This is when I saw the dark figures moving about in the woods. I should have never tampered with the "Book Of The Dead." I now know that what- ever it is I have resurrected through this book, is coming for me. 
LINDA 
You know, I always thought I had some sort of extra sense. You know, like e.s.p or something. 
SHELLY 
What's this one? 
She holds up the queen of spades. 
LINDA 
Another seven! 
SHELLY 
I don't believe it! 
CHERYL 
(Still looking outside) Queen of spades. 
CHERYL's hand clutches the pen tightly. 
LINDA 
Look at her eyes. 
SCOTT's hand reaches for CHERYL's eyes to inspect them, but they blink open. The pen in her hand races upward, then slashes down, ripping into LINDA's achilles tendon. LINDA screams fiercely and with a blur, the bloodied pen is raised again. ASHLY grabs CHERYL's arm stopping her, but with a powerful swipe, she swings her remaining arm at LINDA who is sent sprawling across the cabin floor. CHERYL then clutches ASHLY and, almost lifting him, sends his body reeling across the room into a book- case which topples over, trapping him beneath its weight. SHELLY stands screaming as CHERYL now advances toward ASHLY's face with the bloody pen. He struggles to pull himself out but cannot. CHERYL is almost upon him when SCOTT grabs her from behind. Effortlessly, she tosses him off and moves toward ASHLY again. SCOTT climbs to his feet and grabs the axe. CHERYL raises the pen above ASHLY's face, and SCOTT gives her a sharp jab in the jaw with the wooden handle. CHERYL stumbles past LINDA and falls backwards, head first into the cellar. She begins to climb out but SCOTT slams the trap door shut upon her hand. It won't close. CHERYL starts to push the trap door open from below. SCOTT climbs on top and is almost thrown off until he viciuosly rams the butt of his axe down upon her protruding hand. Demented screams and moans are heard from below as CHERYL's hand is finally pulled back and SCOTT manages to secure the chain across the hatch. 
57   IN - LB 
Later that evening, LINDA is seen in her bed, sleeping. ASHLY covers her with a blanket, kisses her, and walks to the door, closing it quietly behind him. 
58   IN - M.R. 
ASHLY joins SCOTT and SHELLY who sit near the fire in the main room. From the cellar, strange moans, sobs and laughter emerge, then horrible rasping sounds from CHERYL's breathing. Through the next sequence of dialogue, her breathing becomes louder then somewhat quiet. 
SCOTT 
She'll be okay Ash, she just took a bad bump. 
ASHLY 
(Quietly) Yeah. 
SCOTT and SHELLY listen to the strange noises from below as ASHLY looks out the window to the woods beyond. 
ASHLY 
We've still got a few hours before morning. 
SHELLY 
I don't know if I can wait that long. 
SCOTT 
You have to. We all have to. Then, once it's light out, we'll try to find a way to get around that chasm. 
SHELLY 
(Covering her ears) Why does she keep making those horrible noises? 
ASHLY 
I don't know. 
SHELLY 
Everything's gonna be okay. Come morning- you'll see. 
SHELLY heads to her bedroom. SCOTT walks back to the fireplace and sits. He slices twigs from a branch with the Sumarian dagger and tosses them into the fire. ASHLY glances at the Book Of The Dead, then to the old clock. It stands silent. 
63   EN - CAB 
Again, the evil entity watches from outside. It sees SHELLY leave one room and turn the lights on in another. She begins to undress near the window. The force now moves from behind its cover and rushes at tremendous speed to SHELLY who is looking out her bedroom window. She sees it and sheer terror covers her face as a scream stifles itself in her throat, but it is too late. 
64   IN - M.R. 
A noise is heard from SHELLY's bedroom. SCOTT drops the small stick he was whittling and looks up. He places the dagger on the floor and walks toward SHELLY's room. 
SCOTT 
Shelly, are you okay? 
She does not answer. SCOTT approaches her door and turns to ASHLY. 
SCOTT 
Keep an eye on Cheryl for a minute. 
65   IN - S.B. 
SCOTT enters the darkness of her room and sees nothing amidst the shadows. 
SCOTT 
Shelly? 
He looks over to her window. It is open, and wind blows upon the curtains. 
66   IN - S. BATH 
SCOTT steps into SHELLY's bathroom and sees that the shower curtain is drawn. Cautiously, he moves up to it. 
SCOTT 
Shelly? 
He pulls the curtain back to reveal an empty tub. SCOTT turns back to the bedroom when SHELLY steps into the doorway, posessed. With a scream, she latches upon SCOTT. Her eyes have gone bone white and she claws at SCOTT's face and clothes with her nails. 
67   IN - S.B. 
Screaming, SCOTT stumbles through her bedroom with SHELLY still upon him biting at his throat. 
68   IN - M.R. 
Bury her. 
ASHLY 
You...can't bury Shelly. She's a friend of ours isn't she? 
SCOTT 
Ash, she's dead. 
ASHLY moves away from SCOTT. 
SCOTT 
Shelly's dead. We're gonna bury her now. 
ASHLY bites his lip and looks about blankly. 
69   EN - CAB 
Finally, the body is dragged outside and buried near the work shed. Harsh floodlights from the house make the task look very stark and barren. 
70   IN - M.R. 
SCOTT and ASHLY return inside. ASHLY heads to LINDA's room to check in on her. 
71   IN - L.B. 
He peers in to see LINDA sleeping peacefully. 
72   IN - M.R. 
ASHLY quietly returns to the main room. SCOTT is load- ing new batteries into a flashlight. 
SCOTT 
I saw an old hiking trail when we were driving up here. Now I don't know if it goes all the way around that gorge- 
ASHLY 
-Or if it's even still in tact. 
SCOTT 
Or if it's even still in tact. But uh, I guess I'll find out. Take good care of Linda. 
ASHLY 
It's me Linda. 
LINDA 
Ash, I had a bad dream about Linda. 
ASHLY 
You did baby? 
LINDA 
Yeah. She's all right isn't she? 
ASHLY 
Yeah. Fine. 
LINDA 
Is Shelly okay too Ash? 
ASHLY can no longer hide his fear and anxiety. He speaks in a whisper so as not to let his voice quiver. 
ASHLY 
Yeah, sure. She's sleeping that's all. 
LINDA 
Ash, I love you. (She turns over) 
ASHLY 
Get some rest. 
ASHLY closes the door behind him and the fear from a few hours ago engulfs him once more. 
76   IN - M.R. 
ASHLY moves into the main room and stops dead in his tracks when a voice in the cellar speaks. 
CHERYL 
You lied to her. You lied to Linda. Shelly's not sleeping. She's dead. Don't you know the difference? You killed her. You and Scott cut her up with the axe. She's dead ha-ha-ha-ha- ha-ha- 
ASHLY picks up the axe and slams it down upon the trap door. CHERYL is silent from below for a moment, then the hatch opens an inch or so. (The length of the chain securing it) CHEYL's white eyes can be seen again. 
You'll see. 
He looks off into LINDA's bedroom again, but she is gone. She is now sitting in the corner of the main room where ASHLY is, watching him. SCOTT begins to cough with hor- rible rasping sounds. 
SCOTT 
It's, it's not gonna let us leave... Cheryl...Cheryl was right...we're all gonna die here... 
ASHLY 
We're not gonna die! 
SCOTT 
...All gonna die. All of us. 
ASHLY grabs SCOTT and shakes him violently. 
ASHLY 
We're not gonna die! We're not gonna die! We're getting out of here! Now listen to me- is there a way around the chasm. 
SCOTT passes out. 
ASHLY 
Scotty. Scott! 
ASHLY slaps SCOTT. He stirs awake and mumbles. 
SCOTT 
Jesus Ash. I don't want to die. So... so lonely to die like this. You're not gonna leave me are you? Are you Ash? 
CHERYL 
(Imitating SCOTT) I don't want to die. So lonely to die like this. You're not gonna leave me are you? Are you Ash? Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha- 
ASHLY 
Scott, is there some way around the chasm? 
SCOTT 
Ash, I'm scared- I...I can't feel my legs. 
ASHLY 
86   EN - CAB 
An evening mist drifts out of the woods and cloaks the shed as ASHLY carries LINDA's body outside for burial. He lays the body upon the ground and picks up a shovel. Harsh floodlights from the corners of the cabin create strange shadows on the ground as ASHLY digs LINDA's grave. She lies on her back during the digging. One of her eyes opens. It is white. ASHLY drops the shovel and looks at her. She appears to be dead. 
87   IN - M.R. 
Inside the cabin, CHERYL begins slamming her fists against the trap door in the cellar again. She wants out. The screws holding the hatch in place begin to loosen. 
88   EN - CAB 
ASHLY places LINDA's corpse in the grave, oblivious to CHERYL's pounding. He begins to cover her with dirt. 
89   IN - M.R. 
CHERYL has ripped out all but one screw which holds the trap door in tact. 
90   EN - CAB 
ASHLY glances to the grave and sees LINDA's necklace on top of the dirt mound. He reaches down to pick it up when LINDA's hand shoots up from beneath the grave and grabs him! She pulls herself up out of the grave scream- ing and clutches ASHLY's leg with a black and bloodied hand. He twists around, trying to free himself, but she will not let go. By now, LINDA is almost completely out of the grave. With her fingernails, she rips into ASHLY's leg, tearing his skin. Screaming, he picks up a large log nearby and swings it roundhouse into her face again and again, breaking the wood into smaller bits. She grabs the log with him clinging to the other end, lifts him up and throws ASHLY log and all, away from her. ASHLY hits the ground with considerable force and for the first time begins to comprehend the power of this thing he is dealing with. Thick black ooze pours from LINDA's nose and mouth as she turns toward ASHLY sprawled on the ground. 
ASHLY 
Stay back. 
His hand gropes for the handle of the spade. LINDA advances toward him, laughing. 
ASHLY 
Linda please, if you can still hear me. Keep away. 
His fingers tighten on the wooden handle. With a scream, she lunges toward him. From the ground, ASHLY swings the spade upward, lopping off her head. The head falls into the mud, but the body falls upon him, grabbing and jerk- ing about spasmatically. Thick black ooze pumps from her neck and ASHLY manages to pull himself out from underneath the body. He backs away in disgust and falls. He picks himself up again and sees LINDA's necklace upon the ground. ASHLY stashes it in his pocket and staggers back to the cabin. 
91   IN - M.R. 
Inside, he looks to the main room beyond SCOTT's body. 
ASHLY 
Oh..... 
It is a moan from deep inside him. The trap door is open and CHERYL is gone. ASHLY walks over and kicks it shut. A slight breeze sweeps through the front door causing SHELLY's bedroom door to creak open. ASHLY picks up the rifle again and cautiously moves to the door. 
92   IN - S.B. 
He enters. The room is dark and the closet door bangs back and forth because of the breeze. ASHLY moves toward it, grabs the handle and slowly opens the door. Only clothes are inside. He turns toward the other end of the room and CHERYL pops up in the window right by him. He swings and fires, shattering the window. CHERYL backs away and spots the open front door. 
ASHLY

CASE 39 
Written by 
Ray Wright 
INSPIRED BY REAL EVENTS 
Pitch black. We hear FOOTSTEPS sneaking up an old wooden staircase. Two people moving as one. 
Topping the stairs, they creep down the hall to the closed door that protects us. We can hear them behind it, whispering, bickering insanely, one shushing the other. 
The squeak of a door knob slowly turning. The faint click of the latch. And the door inches open, throwing a razor-thin shaft of light into the darkness where it illuminates a 
FRIGHTENED EYE 
As a ten-year-old GIRL sits up in bed. Dead tired. Staring at the two dark faces peering in at her. 
GIRL I can see you... 
And the door closes, leaving us once more in total darkness. We can hear them bickering again as they shuffle away, their footsteps descending the stairs, fading into the uneasy silence of this old house... 
INT. FIFTH GRADE CLASSROOM, LOS ANGELES - DAY 
A young teacher (DARLA) chalks a lesson on a blackboard in a sun-drenched Los Angeles classroom. 
DARLA -- and we know from yesterday that the base of a triangle times half the height equals the area. 
A girl in the back row raises her hand. 
DARLA Yes, Mia? 
GIRL Lucy's asleep again. 
Darla puts down the chalk and comes up the aisle to where a slight, fair-skinned girl in a thrift shop dress sleeps head down on her desk. The girl from the opening scene. LUCY SHERIDAN. Darla stands over her with obvious concern. Puts a finger to her lips to quiet the giggles. 
DARLA Let her sleep. 
She draws the shade. It drops a shadowbox on the sleeping girl. 
INT. COUNSELING ROOM, DEPARTMENT OF CHILD SERVICES, LOS ANGELES - DAY 
A former gang member sitting with his wife and troubled eight- year-old son. The MARTINEZ FAMILY. A family in crisis. Sitting opposite is an LA County social worker. Twenties. Attractive but overworked. EMILY. 
GANG MEMBER He would just go off, you know, start tearin' the place down. You didn't even know why he was doin' it half the time, you just got out of his way... 
EMILY And what you learned from your father now Diego's learning from you...? 
It's painful for him to hear that. He loves his son, quit the streets for him. Overcome by emotion, he nods yes. 
EMILY That really upsets you, doesn't it? 
He wipes his eyes on his tattooed arm. 
GANG MEMBER Yeah. Cuz I mean I don't want him to be like me. 
The boy looks at his father, has never seen him cry before. 
INT. CORRIDOR - DAY 
Outside the conference room, Emily musses the boy's hair. 
EMILY A whole week without skipping school? Is that true? 
He smiles, nods. A glimpse of the boy he might have been. 
EMILY That's the last time I make a bet with you. (to his parents) See you guys next week. 
The Martinez family heads down the hall, Diego lagging behind. Emily watches with guarded optimism, knowing their chances. Then turns to the NEXT FAMILY, welcoming the BELEAGUERED MOTHER: 
EMILY You cut your hair. It looks great. 
INT. EMILY'S CUBICLE - DAY 
The hurried opening and closing of files reveals PHOTOS of abused children. Bruises. Cuts. Broken bones. Emily trying to locate a single case amid the stacks and clutter on her desk. An angry mother SCREAMING at her on the phone: 
EMILY No one is trying to steal your child, they found bruises and cigarette burns -- Mrs Lynch, I read the medical report -- well, if you feel you need legal representation that's perfectly within your rights... 
A flurry of obscenities followed by a dial tone. Emily puts the phone down. Sighs wearily. 
WAYNE (O.S.) One less Christmas card for Emily. 
Her supervisor WAYNE, forties, gay, leaning in the doorway. 
WAYNE How many active cases you have? 
EMILY Thirty-eight. 
Emily nods yeah, leans in closer, the friendly banter giving way to a moment of real sincerity. 
EMILY If it were anyone, it'd be you. 
They exchange a look then Doug clinks his glass against hers. And as they drink together after a long day, more than friends, less than lovers... 
INT. EMILY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Emily in glasses, reading the Sheridan file on her bed. The preliminary report concerns her: "Socially withdrawn. Lack of appetite. Sleeping at school..." 
Her gaze returns to Lucy's photo. Sadly, under her breath: 
EMILY What are they doing to you? 
EXT. SHERIDAN HOUSE - DAY 
A dark, rundown family home on a once-prosperous cul de sac. Emily pulls up. Gets out. Checks that she has the right address. Halfway up the walk something stops her dead in her TRACKS - 
A WOMAN'S FACE 
staring at her through one of the lacy white curtains upstairs. Ghostly pale. Gone as soon as she sees it. Emily stands frozen for a moment. Walks on. 
She reaches to knock on the door and it opens abruptly, the security chain snapping taut. A woman's voice growls at her from the darkness inside: 
WOMAN'S VOICE What? 
EMILY Emily Jennings. Child Services? We spoke on the phone...? 
Peering through the crack is the pallid, bony face from the upstairs window. Lucy's mother. MARGARET SHERIDAN. 
MARGARET You said the seventeenth. 
EMILY Today is the seventeenth. 
MARGARET Is not. 
EMILY I'm sorry, but it is. 
MARGARET Friday was the thirteenth. 
Emily, rather amazed at the conversation she's having, takes a newspaper from her bag. Indicates the date. 
EMILY Friday was the fourteenth, that makes today the seventeenth. Monday the seventeenth. The date of our appointment. 
The door closes in Emily's face. What the hell? Then we hear the chain unlock. It opens again. 
And we get our first good look at Lucy's mother. Gaunt. Pale. Dark rings under her eyes. She steps aside, not welcoming Emily in, merely allowing her to enter. 
INT. SHERIDAN HOUSE - DAY 
It's dark, the curtains drawn. Margaret twitches one open in begrudging courtesy. The house is tidy but sad, steeped in a kind of puritanical gloom. Lucy peers down through the upstairs banister, anxious, unsure what's going on. Emily sees her, smiles. 
EMILY Come down, I'd like to meet you. 
Lucy hesitates, sensing her mother's disapproval. Comes slowly down the stairs. Emily shakes her hand. 
EMILY My name's Emily. What's yours? 
LUCY Lucy. 
EMILY Pretty name. Pretty girl. 
Lucy turns shyly away. 
EMILY (TO MARGARET) Is there somewhere we can talk? 
Margaret sighs and heads down the hall. 
INT. LIVING ROOM, SHERIDAN HOUSE - DAY 
Emily, file in hand, trying to project professionalism in an arm chair that tilts to one side. Margaret and Lucy sitting opposite on the sofa. 
EMILY When do you expect your husband back? 
Margaret shrugs. 
EMILY Because we've found it's more beneficial if the whole family participates. 
MARGARET Well he's not home so... 
Shrugs again. 
EMILY Do you have any way of contacting him? 
MARGARET Not if I don't know where he is. 
Just then we hear a POWER TOOL go on in the basement. Emily, sensing the lie, indicates the floor. 
INT. PRIVATE CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 
Gazing fondly at Lucy, Edward directs his comments at Wayne, who sits opposite the family with Emily. 
EDWARD They really are God's miracles. Day she was born was the happiest day of our lives. We're not perfect parents, we know that, but we figure if you let `em know how much you love `em a lot of the other stuff takes care of itself. 
Wayne nods his agreement. Edward puts his arm around Lucy for effect. Her eyes go to Emily. A silent plea for help. 
EMILY (HOSTILE) Tell me, Mr Sheridan, since you've suddenly acquired the power of speech, doesn't it concern you a little that Lucy's grades have gone from A's to D's in three months? 
EDWARD Course it does, she's our daughter. 
With a glance Wayne cautions Emily about her tone of voice. 
EMILY So you have no idea why she's falling asleep at school every day? Why she's not able to sleep at home? 
Edward looks at Margaret, then Emily, affects bewilderment. 
EDWARD Bad dreams? 
INT. BREAK ROOM - DAY 
Emily and Wayne in private conversation. She's pissed off. The Sheridan family in the other room, preparing to leave. 
EMILY He's gonna be having bad dreams when he gets hit with child endangerment. (off Wayne's reluctance) Don't tell me you're buying this daddy's little girl routine? 
WAYNE So they're overcompensating a little. 
EMILY A little? Let me talk to her. Alone. She wants to talk. 
WAYNE EM -- 
EMILY Five minutes. Talk to them about how much they love kids. 
She goes out the door. 
INT. CORRIDOR - DAY 
Emily walks with Lucy, looking for a way in. 
EMILY I knew someone at school named Lucy, she was a writer. Do you ever write? I do sometimes, it helps me sort out how I'm feeling. 
Lucy doesn't take the bait. She stops for a drink at a water fountain. Emily bends for a sip after. Misfires. As she wipes her face, embarrassed: 
EMILY Okay, I just shot like a gallon of water up my nose. So much for establishing trust. 
Lucy smiles, for the first time. It's the opening Emily was looking for. Maintaining that precious eye contact, DEEPENING IT: 
EMILY What's happening to you? I can help. Let me help. 
Lucy looks away, eyes brimming with tears. 
EMILY What is it, sweetheart? 
LUCY They hate me. 
She lowers her head in shame, tears rolling down. 
EMILY I'm sure they don't hate you. 
LUCY They do. I hear them. They go in the cellar and talk. 
EMILY What do they talk about? 
LUCY Sending me to hell. 
Emily's mouth falls open. 
EMILY You've heard them say that? 
Lucy nods. As Emily registers this in quiet horror... 
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 
A tape recorder is running. Emily and Wayne alone with Lucy. She's hesitant to speak, naturally distrustful. 
EMILY It's okay. You can tell him. He's on our side. 
WAYNE Did you hear your parents say they were going to hurt you? 
Nobody sees what Lucy sees at this moment. Edward glaring in at her through the window. Lucy looks at Wayne, shakes her head. Wayne looks at Emily, case closed. 
INT. CORRIDOR - DAY 
Emily watches in agony as the Sheridan family steps into the elevator. Parent on each side, Lucy gives her one last pleading look then the elevator doors close and she's gone. 
INT. WAYNE'S OFFICE - DAY 
LUCY If I do? 
Emily holds her gaze, seeing the fear. Backing away, Lucy indicates the bus. 
LUCY I have to go. They get mad when I miss the bus. 
Lucy turns to go. Emily watches. Helpless. 
EMILY Lucy, wait... 
Takes her cell phone from her bag. Puts her number on speed dial. 
EMILY If anything happens, call me, okay? Just press this. Don't let your parents know you have it. 
Tucks the cell phone in Lucy's coat pocket. 
EMILY I'm gonna get you out of there, I promise. 
Lucy boards the bus. Waves to Emily from a back window as it drives away. Emily waves back, heart in her throat. Might be the last time she sees her alive. 
INT. EMILY'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
A sleepless night finds Emily slouched on her sofa, leaving a MESSAGE: 
ANSWERING MACHINE Hey, this is Doug, here it comes - 
BEEP. 
EMILY It's me, thought you might be up, um, anyway, call if you get this. 
Hangs up. Clicks on the tv remote. Channel-surfs. World news. Cooking show. Home shopping network. 
Hip-hop music video. Watches it for a moment. Gangster with a mic. Scantily-clad girls shaking their asses. 
The phone RINGS. Emily mutes the tv, picks up. 
EMILY Too late, I met someone else... 
A child's whisper. 
LUCY (V.O.) Emily...? 
EMILY (concerned but calm) Lucy? Are you okay? 
LUCY (V.O.) I'm scared... 
EMILY Why? Why are you scared, honey? 
LUCY (V.O.) They're waiting to get me, I can hear them... I'm sorry... 
EMILY Why are you sorry? 
LUCY (V.O.) I'm falling asleep... 
EMILY Okay, listen, I want you to go over and open the window. Can you do that? Lucy...? 
LUCY (V.O.) (softly; drifting off) I'm sooorry... 
EMILY Lucy, no, wake up! 
INT. LUCY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
The cell phone lying on the bed at Lucy's fingertips. 
EMILY (FROM PHONE) Lucy...?! 
The illuminated screen casts an eerie glow on her SLEEPING FACE. 
INT. EMILY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Emily drops the phone. Moment of panic. Then a decision. Throws a coat on over her bed clothes. Grabs the phone again, dials a number in desperation. 
EMILY Mike, it's Emily, listen, that girl I told you about, I think she's in trouble - - yeah, I know what you said, but -- Mike, you're not listening -- (LOSES IT) HELP ME! 
EXT. EMILY'S CAR - NIGHT 
Emily fumbles with her keys. Gets the right one in the door. Opens it. Jumps in. Starts the engine. Peels off down the road. 
INT. LUCY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
The cell phone turns itself off, plunging the room into total darkness. 
In BLACK, we hear FOOTSTEPS coming up the stairs. Down the hall. Stopping at the door. The knob turning. The click of the latch. The door opening. A shaft of light. Edward and Margaret peering in with frenzied anticipation: 
Lucy is asleep. The time has come. 
INT. EMILY'S CAR - NIGHT 
Emily shoves Margaret aside and throws open the oven. Pulls Lucy out onto the kitchen floor, swatting out her burning pajamas with a dish towel. 
Margaret grabs a steak knife and rushes at Emily, but Barron has her covered. Backhands Margaret so hard it spins her around fully before dropping her to the floor. 
BARRON The hell's the matter with you people?! 
Pajamas scorched, wild with terror, Lucy cries in great heaving sobs in Emily's arms. Reduced to tears herself, Emily keeps saying the same thing over and over. 
EMILY I gotcha... I gotcha... I gotcha... 
Shielding her from the sight of her parents: Margaret sprawled on the linoleum weeping. Edward slouched against the fridge, blood pouring down his shirt, his broken jaw hanging open like a man thinking wow. 
INT. COUNTY COURTROOM - DAY 
Edward and Margaret holding hands at the defendant's table, remorseless and defiant in their Sunday best. Among the many spectators we find Emily and Mike Barron. The STATE PROSECUTOR and PUBLIC DEFENDER addressing the JUDGE. 
STATE PROSECUTOR Prosecution asks that you disallow an insanity defense. This was an act committed with premeditation, malice AFORETHOUGHT - 
PUBLIC DEFENDER Your honor, the egregiousness of the crime makes the competency question all the more relevant. 
JUDGE Yes. I hereby order the defendants undergo psychiatric evaluation to determine their mental fitness for trial. 
Emily rolls her eyes at Barron, some justice system. 
EXT. COURTHOUSE PARKING LOT - DAY 
Barron walks Emily to her car. She's outraged. 
EMILY Steal a pizza, San Quentin, try killing your kid, Freudian dream analysis. 
BARRON Well, you're gonna hate me for saying this, but my money's on crazy. 
EMILY Did they or did they not know what they were doing? That's the legal standard. They knew, they knew damn well! 
BARRON It's not that simple sometimes. 
EMILY (stops on a dime) Meaning what exactly? 
Barron hesitates. He's crossing the line by telling her this. 
BARRON When we brought them in that night they told Captain Lister... They think she's evil, some kind of demon spirit, minion of the devil or something. 
EMILY (LAUGHS) Oh, that's great - what is this, late- night cable? 
BARRON No, but that might be the world they're living in. 
INT. CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL - DAY 
Lucy in a hospital bed, dressings on her hand. Emily's friend Doug sitting bedside. Child psychologist. 
DOUG -- and what's the most important thing we talked about that you have to remember? 
LUCY It's not my fault what happened. 
DOUG That's right and you know what? It's not. 
Lucy nods, not entirely convinced. Doug gives her a pat, crosses to the exit. At the door he runs into Emily. Shakes his head, awed at what she did. 
DOUG That is some seriously proactive social work happenin' there. You all right? 
EMILY Yeah, I'm okay. How's she doing? 
DOUG Typical reaction, blames herself. We'll get there. I'm gonna put her in a group setting, see if I can get her to open up. 
EMILY Group therapy for kids, what's that say about the world? 
He nods - no kidding, heads off. Emily comes over and sits on Lucy's bed. Strokes her hair. 
EMILY Good news. You get to leave here tomorrow. 
LUCY Doug said I might have to go to a state home. 
EMILY Only for a few days, till we find a better place. 
LUCY Why can't I live with you? 
EMILY Oh, sweetheart. That would never be allowed. 
LUCY Why? 
EMILY It's complicated, there's a whole process, I'm not even a foster parent... 
Lucy gives a sad nod. Emily touches her arm. 
EMILY I'm sorry. 
EXT. STATE CHILDREN'S HOME - DAY 
Nice moment for Emily. A rare triumph. She tucks Lucy in. Turns off the bedside light. 
EMILY I'm right down the hall if you need me. 
Lucy settles. Emily pauses at the door, looks back at the lost child she's taken in, then closes the door halfway. 
EXT. SHERIDAN HOUSE - DAY 
Dark, abandoned. Emily's Volvo pulls up. 
INT. EMILY'S CAR - DAY 
She eyes the house. It haunts her, the memory of what happened. 
A SUDDEN KNOCK on the window makes her jump out of her seat. The guy there gestures a friendly sorry, didn't mean to scare you. White shirt and tie. A COURT CLERK. 
EXT. SHERIDAN HOUSE - DAY 
Emily signs a form as he unlocks the door, letting her in. 
EMILY I have to grab some of her things, might take me a minute. 
COURT CLERK I trust ya, Em, make sure you lock it on the way out. 
INT. SHERIDAN HOUSE - DAY 
Emily closes the door, glances around the dark interior. Through a window she sees the Court Clerk drive off. She's alone. It's quiet, eerily still. 
She goes up the stairway. Slows, noticing something on the WALL - 
A FAINT SQUARE where a picture once was hung, the wallpaper a half tone darker underneath. More SQUARES farther up. A few nails still sticking out. 
INT. LUCY'S BEDROOM, SHERIDAN HOUSE - DAY 
Tattered lace curtains sway in a draft beside a bed with a moth-eaten coverlet. Emily packs Lucy's spare clothes into a dufflebag. Zips it and walks out. 
INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY 
Exiting Lucy's room, she notes the door to Edward and Margaret's bedroom, at the far end of the hall, is slightly AJAR. Succumbs to a natural curiosity. 
INT. EDWARD AND MARGARET'S BEDROOM - DAY 
The door pushes open, Emily peering in. A sad little master bedroom with old floral printed wallpaper and water stains on the ceiling. 
She explores the room, inspecting various personal items - aftershave, glasses, hair brush - looking for clues to their madness. 
An ALARM CLOCK with a cracked crystal face. She picks it up and it GOES OFF in her hand. Gives her a scare. She puts it down. Sees something out the bedroom window. Steps closer. Parts the curtains. 
In the backyard, by the garden shed, a long rectangular hole has been dug. A SHALLOW GRAVE filling with leaves. Edward's handiwork. Emily's seen enough, heads for the door. 
But slows, noticing something odd as she comes back around the bed - 
A LONG DEEP SCRATCH 
in the wooden floor, hidden under a long runner rug. Emily peels back the rug and finds - 
HUNDREDS OF LONG DEEP SCRATCHES 
in the floorboards leading toward the door. Something - the old oak bureau perhaps? - has been dragged repeatedly across the room. 
Emily comes over and looks behind the door and sees, on the back of it, something even more bizarre - 
TWO MASSIVE DEADBOLTS 
screwed hastily, crookedly, into the wood. She closes the door. Slides-to the big heavy bolts - 
CLUNK. 
CLUNK. 
Pauses. Looks again at the bureau. Slides it in front of the door, a wheelless caster bracket leaving another long scratch in the hardwood. And it's clear at this point what the deadbolts and bureau add up to - 
A BARRICADE 
Emily stares at it. Looks over at Edward and Margaret's bed, imagining them here behind this door. Slides the bureau aside. Opens the deadbolts. And as the door swings open she is looking straight down the hall at 
LUCY'S BEDROOM 
Emily stares, bewildered. 
INT. GROUP THERAPY ROOM - DAY 
ABUSED CHILDREN aged eight to thirteen sit in a circle of folding chairs. Lucy among them. Diego. Doug facilitating. 
DOUG Sometimes when our parents aren't getting along it's better if they don't see each other for a while, that's what a `restraining order' does... 
INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE GROUP THERAPY - DAY 
EMILY Did you not hear me? I'm telling you, Mike, as a friend, I did not call that family. 
BARRON Then who did? Go find the guy who broke in and just happened to dial the number of a kid whose case you handle. 
Emily starts to say something, but stops as a confounding realization comes to her. And then to Barron. 
INT. EMILY'S HOUSE - DAY 
Lucy sits on the sofa studying a photo of Diego. Emily sits beside her, her advocate. Barron opposite. 
LUCY He's in my group... (puts down photo) ...why, did something happen? 
Emily nods yes. Barron, gently, mindful of Lucy's age: 
BARRON We're trying to figure out why. He got a call Thursday night from this number. I'm just wondering if he might have said anything... 
LUCY It wasn't me. 
BARRON You didn't call him? 
Lucy shakes her head. Barron nods okay, then, speaking to her as a father might his own daughter: 
BARRON Lucy, it's hard sometimes to tell the truth, but I know you will because you're a good little girl. 
LUCY I am telling the truth. 
EMILY My backup files are in your room. Diego's is in there. Maybe you got curious and went through some, dialed a number? 
LUCY It wasn't me, I swear. 
Complete innocence. Emily nods okay, wanting to believe, but remembering the stolen photograph. 
BARRON The call was at 2 am, are you ever up that late? 
LUCY I didn't call him. 
BARRON Are you ever up that late? 
EMILY Mike, she said no. Maybe someone made a mistake. 
Barron reads Emily's posture and disengages, stands to go. 
BARRON Yeah, maybe so. Night, Lucy. 
INT. FRONT DOOR, EMILY'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Exiting, Barron tells Emily as gently as possible: 
BARRON She's lying. 
And goes down the steps. Emily closes the door. Turns around and there's Lucy. Uncomfortably close. 
LUCY Do you believe me? 
EMILY I believe you. 
Lucy hugs her and Emily hugs her back, but she's still thinking about what Barron said. 
INT. EMILY'S CUBICLE - DAY 
A PHOTO of Emily and Diego tacked to the corkboard panel beside her desk. Emily sits contemplating it. Her gaze goes from the photo to the BARE SHELF above her desk. Her caseload is still missing. This is bullshit. 
INT. WAYNE'S OFFICE - DAY 
Emily walks in, power pose. 
EMILY Give me back my cases or fire me. Right now. 
Wayne, caught unprepared, eating a doughnut. 
INT. EMILY'S OFFICE - DAY 
Caseload restored, Emily is multi-tasking, opening mail, sorting backlogged paperwork, talking on the phone: 
EMILY I don't care if it's a hairline fracture, he broke her arm, I don't want him back in that house. He what? He found Christ? When? That recently? Uh huh. Well he should have found Him sooner. 
Hangs up. Doug leans in the doorway, drops a manila envelope in her in-box. And a computer printout. 
EMILY What's up? 
DOUG Copy of the Sheridans' psych evals for the file. And the cognitive profile Lucy did for me the other day. 
EMILY (re: Lucy's profile) How's it look? 
DOUG WINTERS Normal. 
But his tone suggests otherwise. 
After hours, the office is empty, half lit and eerily still. Emily is photocopying at a work station, haunted by what Diego said, the harsh upward light accentuating her tense features. 
The CYCLICAL SQUEAKING NOISE we hear is Lucy, in Emily's cubicle in the b.g., turning herself in circles on the office chair. Something very creepy about the disappearance and reappearance of that pale watchful face. 
Finished, Emily walks back to her cubicle, thrown by the sight of Lucy spinning in the chair, walking head-on into that eerie intermittent gaze. 
LUCY Do... (TURNS) you... (TURNS) like... (TURNS) working... (TURNS) here? 
Emily, unnerved, enters the cubicle. 
EMILY Well, photocopying isn't much fun. 
Lucy stops turning, stares at her, sensing something. 
EMILY What...? 
Lucy just stares. Doug appears in the doorway. 
DOUG Knock, knock. Sorry I'm late, guys. (TO LUCY) Ready, kiddo? 
Lucy nods and gets up from the chair. 
DOUG Go ahead down, I'll be right there. 
Lucy heads down the hall to the conference room. 
DOUG (TO EMILY) You all right? 
EMILY This is weird. Diego said it was Lucy that called, but he called her a he, he said it was a man. 
His face - what? Emily nods yes. Doug's brow arches then furrows. He turns and heads down the hall. 
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT 
Doug sits opposite Lucy at the table, keeps it easygoing despite what he's just been told. 
DOUG So how's school? 
LUCY Fine. 
DOUG Any of your classmates giving you a hard time? 
LUCY No, they've been nice. 
DOUG Sleeping okay? 
LUCY That's not really what you want to talk about, is it, Doug? 
Awkward pause. Awkward smile. 
DOUG You got me. 
Opens his file. Takes out her cognitive assessment profile. Lays it flat on the table. 
DOUG Question 16a, are you afraid of the dark? You answered `no'. Question 16b, are you afraid of being alone? `No'. 16c, are afraid of your parents? `No'. You answered `no' to everything in that section. I think some of those should have been yesses. Everybody is afraid of something. Working through our fears, conquering them, is how we get better. So I want you to tell me... What scares you? 
Lucy steeples her fingers and rests her chin on top, regards Doug with a look of frank appraisal. It is the face of a child, but behind those eyes there is a keen intelligence. 
LUCY I'll tell you what scares me if you tell me what scares you. 
Doug did not see this coming. 
DOUG Fair enough. When I was twelve I was climbing a tree and I accidentally put my hand through a giant hornets' nest. They didn't like it. I got stung over a hundred times. They had to rush me to the hospital. I've been afraid of hornets ever since. Don't climb many trees either. (SMILES) Everybody has fears. Now, what scares you? 
LUCY Me. 
Pause. 
DOUG You scare yourself? 
LUCY Sometimes. 
DOUG Why, what about yourself scares you? 
LUCY I have bad thoughts. 
DOUG About what? 
LUCY People. 
DOUG People in general or certain people? 
LUCY Certain people. 
DOUG Like who? 
LUCY You. 
INT. LUCY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
EMILY SILHOUETTED in the doorway, keeping her distance as she SAYS GOODNIGHT: 
EMILY Get some rest. 
She starts to close the door. 
LUCY You forgot to kiss me goodnight. 
A tense pause then Emily walks over and kisses her on the forehead. 
EMILY Goodnight. 
Lucy clutches her wrist as she turns to go. 
LUCY I love you. 
Emily, trapped, forces a tender smile. 
EMILY I love you, too. 
Lucy's EYES GLEAM in the darkness. She turns onto her side for sleep, but those eyes don't shut even after Emily has walked out and closed the door behind her. 
INT. DOUG'S CONDO - NIGHT 
Football highlights on a liquid plasma tv. Doug flipping through a DSM IV diagnostic manual. The phone RINGS. He picks up, distracted, scanning the DSM index. 
DOUG Hello? 
A strange INTERMITTENT STATIC BUZZ on the line. 
DOUG Hello...? 
BZZZZT. BZZZZT. BZZZZT. A telecommunications glitch. 
DOUG Try again, sorry. 
He hangs up. Finds the chapter he's looking for. ANTI- SOCIAL PERSONALITY TYPE. But he hears it again now - 
BZZZZZZZZT BZZZZZZZZZT - louder, deeper - and realizes, in quiet terror, that it's coming from INSIDE HIS EAR. 
INT. DOUG'S BATHROOM - NIGHT 
Doug opens the medicine cabinet and grabs a Q-tip. Wiggles it around in his ear and when he takes it out there's a 
HORNET 
sitting on the cottony tip, scissoring its wings. 
Doug stares in disbelief. Mouth gaping. 
He throws the Q-tip in the toilet. Hits the flush lever. Watches the hornet spiral away. Gone. 
Stares at the empty bowl. Did I just imagine that? 
Shaken, he turns to the sink. Wedges his head under the tap and runs water into his ear. 
Straightens and looks at himself in the mirror, toweling his face, trying to impose rational thought on the situation. But as the water spills from his ear, down his neck, onto his shirt, it brings with it - 
TWO MORE LIVE HORNETS, half drowned. 
With a yelp Doug swipes them from his shirt. Crushes them underfoot. Terrified, but clinging to rational thought a moment longer, he turns his head sideways to the mirror, parts his hair, and sees - 
ANOTHER HORNET crawl from the ear canal, followed by SIX OR SEVEN MORE! 
DOUG FUCK! 
Rationality goes out the window. He flails at them with the towel. Swats them dead. Picks them up and drops them in the toilet. Studies the last one for a moment. Its little legs twitching. Drops it in. Flushes. 
A false respite. And a brief one. Because as the FLUSHING NOISE FADES he can hear an ominous DEEP BUZZING SOUND RISING. 
It's coming from behind him. He turns to have a look. Nothing there. Bare wall. 
But it's strange: the BUZZING IS STILL BEHIND HIM. 
With dawning horror Doug turns and checks his back in the mirror, sees 
HIS ENTIRE SHIRT BACK IS CRAWLING WITH HORNETS! 
Whimpering like a child, he undoes the buttons of his shirt, taking it off as delicately as possible. Slipping his arms gently from the sleeves. 
Holding it by the collar, he takes two quick steps and tosses it in the shower. Slams the glass door, seals the crack with towels. And watches the hornets fly around in the glass enclosure, BUZZING FURIOUSLY, bouncing off the glass. 
But as he backpedals he realizes the FURIOUS BUZZING is too close, too loud and too deep, to be coming from the shower over there. A sharp pain in his head confirms it. He GROANS and brings a hand to his ear as something awful happens inside. 
The BUZZING in his right ear spreads to his left - LOUDER, ANGRIER, its sources multiplying. Disoriented, he stumbles backwards with an AGONIZING SCREAM. Catches sight of himself in the mirror, the terror of the moment on his face. This can't be happening. 
EMILY You're saying he did that to himself? 
CORONER It appears all his injuries were self- inflicted, yes. 
EMILY Oh come on. He looked like he'd been beaten to death! Don't tell me he was some - some suicidal... (BREAKING DOWN) ...I knew him! He was my best friend! 
She turns away crying. 
CORONER Miss, I would never presume to know your friend better than you. But the injuries suggest he was trying to hurt himself. Unfortunately, he succeeded. I am sorry. 
Emily, composing herself, gives a quiet nod. She has no quarrel with this man. 
EMILY Have you ever seen this before, somebody dying like this? 
The coroner files the report, world weary. 
CORONER Truly, I am shocked every day by the violence people do to themselves. 
INT. CEMETERY - DAY 
DOUGLAS J. WINTERS etched in granite. A final prayer read by a PRIEST as he is laid to rest. 
A breeze ruffles the clothes of the MOURNERS. Blows hair across Emily's haunted face. 
Lucy, at her side, sees her grief and reaches for her hand. Instinctively, Emily retracts it. Lucy registers the slight, the wider implications. 
Emily watches the coffin descend. She weeps openly. 
INT. EMILY'S CAR - DAY 
Emily, red-eyed, driving home, sees something in her peripheral vision that sends a chill through her. 
Lucy, gazing quietly out the passenger-side window, is SWINGING HER LEGS in that contented way children do. A small but telling detail. Immediately HER LEGS STOP SWINGING, sensing Emily's stare. And with her head still turned away: 
LUCY You think it's my fault, don't you? 
She turns to face Emily, who measures her words. 
EMILY It was an accident. It was nobody's fault. 
Lucy holds her gaze. Then, as if to test her, reaches again for Emily's hand. Trapped in the lie, Emily has to let her. And as she drives on in that private hell, holding hands with Lucy... 
INT. MIKE BARRON'S OFFICE - DAY 
Emily, an emotional wreck, confides in Barron. 
EMILY He was scared. He came out of that room with her, Mike, and he was scared. He said she threatened him. 
BARRON Listen. You're still in shock. Let's NOT -- 
EMILY Diego said it was a man on the phone. You know who made that call. There was no one else in the house. (off his look) You think I don't know how crazy this sounds?! 
BARRON Look, I don't know, all I'm saying is a kid in his state of mind maybe isn't the most reliable witness. 
EMILY Why is he in that state of mind? Why was Doug? Pull my phone records. See if she called him. 
BARRON Emily. I already did. There were no calls from your house. 
Emily's argument collapses. She sits there for a moment, vexed, her intellect telling her one thing, her gut another. She gets up to go. Pauses at the door. 
EMILY Her mother and father, their bedroom door has these deadbolts on it, big ones, two of `em... Something came through that door and they didn't want it ever coming through there again. 
INT. EMILY'S CUBICLE - DAY 
Emily digs through her in-box, spilling things on the floor. Finds the manila envelope Doug gave her. Rips it open. Dumps the contents into her hand. 
A VIDEO TAPE 
Typed on the label: Sheridan, Marg. & Ed., Prelim. Psych Interviews. 
CUT TO: 
ON A TELEVISION - Margaret Sheridan sits facing the camera, responding to the questions of an unseen interviewer. Her haunted face and frank tone make the interview chilling. 
INTERVIEWER And by forcing your daughter into the oven, can you tell me, what did you think the outcome would be? 
MARGARET You mean what were we doing it for? 
INTERVIEWER Yes. 
MARGARET To kill her. 
INTERVIEWER Why? 
MARGARET God's will. 
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 
EDWARD IT'S NOT CHILD KILLING IF SHE'S NOT A CHILD! 
And that's the interview. Emily stares at the BLANK BLUE SCREEN, transfixed, lowers her gaze to the table. 
There's a PHOTO tucked inside the psychiatric file. Edward and Margaret in happier times - YOUNG BIBLE CAMP COUNSELORS in T-shirts and hiking boots on a path through sunlit forest. Sweet. Innocent. Emily's age. The year they met perhaps. 
She holds it up to the newspaper mugshots for a before-and- after comparison. The transformation of their faces is shocking. Emily sits frozen by the realization: Edward and Margaret Sheridan. Not criminals. Victims. 
INT. STATE PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY 
An old brick orphanage turned psychiatric hospital. Emily's Volvo goes up the winding tree-lined drive. 
CHIEF PSYCHIATRIST (V.O.) Unfortunately Mrs Sheridan suffered a rather severe psychotic episode last night... 
INT. STATE PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY 
Emily and the CHIEF PSYCHIATRIST walk down a dark, institutional corridor. 
CHIEF PSYCHIATRIST ...Woke up screaming, absolutely convinced she was on fire. She wasn't, of course, they managed to sedate her. But it's curious, she displays all the symptoms of a burn patient. Except the burns themselves... 
Margaret's door. Emily peers through a little square of reinforced glass. A padded cell. Margaret strapped to a bed. Writhing in pain. Laboring to breathe. Eyes swimming. 
CHIEF PSYCHIATRIST In no condition for visitors as you can see. If you'd like, I could let you see Mr Sheridan? 
Emily hesitates, afraid of him. 
EMILY Okay. 
She casts a departing glance through the window and shudders to see that Margaret's roaming eyes have locked on her in a hollow stare. 
INT. VISITATION ROOM, PSYCH HOSPITAL - DAY 
Restrained in a straitjacket, Edward is brought in by two orderlies who seat him at a table opposite Emily and then exit. Jaw wired, everything he says is spoken through clenched teeth. 
EMILY I know I'm probably the last person you want to see right now, but you're... 
His stare unnerves her. She stops and collects herself. 
EMILY You're the only one I can talk to. Lucy's been staying with me - 
EDWARD Who died? 
Emily falls silent. Her voice cracks with emotion. 
EMILY A friend. 
Edward nods yup. Regards her in silence. Emily speaks, or tries to, just to fill that awful void. 
EMILY I, ummm... 
EDWARD You're scared. 
Emily, skewered again, nods yes. 
EDWARD You oughta be. 
Dead silence. She meets his gaze. And there is eye contact, true understanding. 
EDWARD You judged us before you ever walked in that house. Sat there in our living room tellin' us about our problems, how to be better parents - certain of everything and dead wrong about all of it. (THEN) Ask what you came to ask. 
After a moment: 
EMILY What is she? 
It's a question Edward has asked himself once or twice. He leans back in his chair and folds his arms with an almost casual air. 
EDWARD Can tell you what she's not. She not a daughter of mine. She's not a ten-year- old having trouble in school. She's not some innocent victim whose door you busted down and life you saved. And she's not going no place, lady, till she's good and done with you. 
EMILY Done with me how? 
EDWARD However she wants. You think it's an accident her ending up with you? She saw you coming a mile away. 
EMILY Why me? I don't have anything. 
EDWARD You have that you're good. Kindness. Decency. That's what she feeds on. Bleeds ya dry, moves onto the next. We were a big family, she went through us like a wrecking ball. And you know, every time something happened, every time, we had an excuse for why it wasn't her fault. Cuz it's easier to lie to yourself than think bad things about your baby girl. But finally we got to a point where me and Maggy looked at each other - (remembers so clearly) - where we looked at each other and we was out of lies, both of us. Most terrifying moment of our lives. And that's where you are now. 
Emily silently registering this truth. 
EDWARD I'll tell you this. She sees everything. And what she doesn't see she just sort of senses it, like when you call a friend and they pick up before it rings? (MORE) 
EDWARD(CONT'D) Only time you got the upper hand is when she's sleepin' but she almost never does. We checked on her every night for three months. Every twenty minutes, up and down those stairs. First time she slept was the night you kicked in my front door. 
After a moment: 
EMILY What does she want? 
EDWARD To know... what your idea of hell is... and make you live there. 
gets off and comes up the sidewalk toward the house. Sensing Emily's stare, she stops and meets it. Waves, testing the waters. Emily waves back but it's a hollow gesture. Lucy's smile fades, knowing this as she continues toward the house. 
In a sudden panic Emily goes into the kitchen, grabs one of the knives. Eyes the blade, forced to contemplate the unthinkable - its use as a weapon, self-defense. 
She comes into the living room, holding it. Catches sight of herself in the mirror. A jarring image: 
Sweet Emily Jennings with a butcher's knife in her hand. 
The sound of LUCY'S FOOTSTEPS on the front steps breaks the spell. 
Emily hides the knife behind the fish tank. No good, you can see it through the glass. 
We hear LUCY'S KEY IN THE LOCK. 
Emily grabs the knife. It's in her hand as the door CLICKS open, until the last second when she tosses it under a sofa pillow. 
Lucy enters. Shy. Innocent. A ten-year-old home from school. 
LUCY Hi. 
Emily returns a plastic smile. 
EMILY Hi. 
LUCY You weren't there so I took the bus. 
EMILY Sorry, work - lost track of time. 
LUCY It's okay, I know how busy you are. 
Emily watches unnerved as Lucy crosses to the sofa, to the very pillow where she hid the butcher's knife, and sits down to untie her shoes. The point of the knife is almost touching her leg. If she moves at all, it will cut the skin. 
LUCY Doesn't matter anyway, the bus stops right at the end of the street. So I can always get home, whether you're there or not. 
EMILY Lucky. 
Lucy nods then pauses and looks at the pillow, or appears to, but she is actually looking at the end table. 
LUCY Where's the phone? 
EMILY Oh, it wasn't working... 
Lucy nods oh. Finishes untying her shoes then gets up and walks into the kitchen, checks the wall, turns to Emily. 
LUCY Wow. That one, too. 
Emily, caught in a lie, says nothing. 
LUCY Can I have a shower? We had gym today... 
Emily nods. Lucy heads into the bathroom. Pauses at the door, back turned. 
LUCY Are they being nice to her? 
EMILY Who? 
LUCY My mother. 
She turns for Emily's reaction. 
EMILY How - how would I know that? 
LUCY I thought you said you were going to see her. 
EMILY I never said that. 
Lucy frowns. A bewilderment that seems genuine. 
LUCY Hm. I must have dreamt it. 
Goes into the bathroom. Closes the door. 
INT. EMILY'S HOUSE - DAY 
Ear pressed to the bathroom door, Emily listens to the RUNNING WATER: Lucy taking a shower. 
She goes to the closet, unlocks it. Grabs one of the phones. 
INT. EMILY'S KITCHEN - DAY 
It sounds like EMILY'S VOICE is coming from the fridge until we sweep past it to see her crouching by a phone jack in the corner. Whispering. 
EMILY I don't care, Robin, anywhere. Just find somewhere that will take her. Tonight. I don't want this girl in my house. 
Emily unplugs the phone. And just then hears a SOFT BREATH behind her. Oh shit. Slowly turns. 
LUCY IN A BATH ROBE BEHIND HER. 
SILENCE. 
Emily listening, barely breathing. Is that it? Is she gone? 
And then suddenly - WHAM! - WHAM! - WHAM! - the pounding turns VIOLENT, practically shaking the door off its hinges. Far too violent for a little girl. 
Emily wedges herself into the corner, absolutely petrified. There is something very strong and very angry on the other side of that door, SHRIEKING in the voice of a child - 
LUCY (O.S.) LET ME IN! 
WHAM - WHAM - WHAM - WHAM - WHAM - WHAM! 
LUCY (O.S.) LET ME IN! 
WHAM - WHAM - WHAM - WHAM - WHAM - WHAM! The door getting absolutely pummeled, looking like it might splinter from the force. And it's so intense that it's almost surreal what Emily is seeing. Lucy's voice eerily monotone, the words coming inhumanly fast like some auctioneer from hell - 
LUCY (O.S.) Let me in, let me in, let me in, let me in, let me in, let me in, let me in, let me in, let me in, let me in... 
Relentless. Tormenting Emily. Until she can't take it anymore. And she SCREAMS as loud as she can, half cursing, half begging, the veins standing out in her neck - 
EMILY LEAVE ME ALONE!!! 
And the POUNDING STOPS DEAD. All we hear is the rain drumming on the roof. And Emily's QUICK TERRIFIED BREATHS as she stares at the door wondering what's next. 
But there's nothing. Just the shadows dancing on the walls. It appears the nightmare is over for now. 
But not quite. 
A sudden CLUNK in the closet makes her jump. Her head snaps around - what was that? She just stares, unable to breathe because whatever she just heard is INSIDE HER ROOM! 
White-knuckled grip on that screwdriver, Emily stands up and comes slowly over to the CLOSET DOOR. 
Raises the screwdriver. Ready to stab. 
Takes hold of the door handle. 
Slowly turns it. 
Opens the door. 
PITCH BLACK inside. 
A tense pause as she stares into that blackness, then reaches a hand into the closet, feeling around for the pull-string. Finds it. Gives it a tug. And there, right in front of her, is a vision of unspeakable horror: 
MARGARET SHERIDAN 
Twitching spasmodically in a hospital gown. HIDEOUSLY BURNED. 
She comes at Emily arms flailing, clumsy with rage and dementia. Emily leaps aside and Margaret goes careening into the furniture, howling and spinning like some crazed Whirling Dervish. 
Emily scrambles over the bed. Reaches the door. Fumbles at the deadbolt. Here comes Margaret. At the last second Emily gets the door open. Runs out. 
INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Tears a path down the dark hallway. Margaret right behind her, hideous, reeling, hitting the walls with her flailing arms. 
Emily throws open the front door. 
EXT. EMILY'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Dashes from the house into the abandoned street. Running in the rain. Margaret comes crashing out of the house, chasing her down the middle of the street. 
Emily sees a city bus parked up ahead. Makes a run for it. 
EXT. METRO BUS - NIGHT 
A metro transit bus idling along the curb. The DRIVER with his feet up between shifts, reading a porno mag. Emily comes running up to the door. Pounds frantically on the glass. 
EMILY Help me! Please! 
The driver meets eyes with her through the door. Keeps reading. Unimpressed. More pounding from Emily. 
EMILY Let me on! 
The driver points to the sign above the door: OUT OF SERVICE. Keeps reading. Emily near hysterics at this point. Margaret closing in fast. 
EMILY She's coming! Please! 
The driver sighs, weighing his obligations. Emily spins, back to the door. Margaret nearly upon her, ten feet away, five, four... 
INT. METRO BUS - NIGHT 
The driver opens the door. Emily dives backwards onto the bus, the door snapping closed in front of her just as Margaret lunges for her throat. 
EMILY Drive! 
BUS DRIVER There's nobody out there. 
Successive pages show the same two hands, but leaning forward into the inky blackness between them is a FACE, its features resolving into murky focus as it approaches the glass. The last page is a horrific image. A man screaming in such terror that his face appears almost deformed. 
It's DOUG. The night of his death. Like a snapshot from his bathroom mirror. 
Emily shudders, the stack of pages tumbling to the floor. Runs out. And we see the photocopies, lying on the floor, are totally BLANK... 
INT. CORRIDOR, CHILD SERVICES BUILDING - NIGHT 
Emily, leaving, rushes down a corridor toward the lobby. Tense. Head on a swivel. Hears MORE SQUEAKING behind her. Spins. 
A NIGHT JANITOR WHEELING A MOP BUCKET 
She walks on. Turns the corner and RUNS INTO SOMEONE UNEXPECTED. Jumps back with a SHRIEK before she realizes who it is. 
EMILY Robin... 
A ponytailed woman in her mid-forties, the child placement specialist Emily called from home. 
ROBIN What are you doing here so late? I tried calling you. I found someone to take Lucy. 
EMILY (STUNNED RELIEF) You did? 
ROBIN Anaheim couple. They've helped us out before. 
She shows Emily a custody form with an attached photo: 
A KIND HUSBAND AND WIFE WITH TWO YOUNG CHILDREN. 
Emily's face darkens. 
EMILY (under her breath) Oh God... 
ROBIN What's the matter? 
Emily stares at the unsuspecting family. Lucy's next victims. She fends off a wave of emotion as the full horror of her predicament hits her. Then, matter-of-factly, facing that fear head-on: 
EMILY I can't. I'm keeping her. 
As Emily walks off, ripping the custody form to shreds, Robin utterly confused... 
INT. STATE PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY 
Emily sits opposite Edward Sheridan in the visiting room, an odd sense of camaraderie between them. 
EMILY If I get rid of her, if I put her into the system... 
EDWARD (NODS YUP) She starts all over again somewhere else. Can't let her stay, can't let her go. That leaves you with one option. 
Eye contact. Emily looks away, shakes her head. 
EMILY I can't, Edward, I -- 
EDWARD You have to. You have to find the strength. Don't you understand? That's why she's doing this. To test you. Test your faith. 
EMILY I don't have any faith. 
EDWARD How `bout anger. Got some of that? 
Emily lowers her gaze to the table. 
EMILY How... how do I...? 
EDWARD Kill her? In her sleep, assuming you can... (THEN; THINKING) Tell you what I'd do different. Count myself dead at the outset. Accept that going in and use it to my advantage. That's the one thing I don't think she'd see coming, someone giving up their own life to take hers. 
As Emily registers this... 
INT. EMILY'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Middle of the night, the living room is lit by the eerie glow of the fish tank. The filter humming. The fish swimming languidly. Suddenly they DISPERSE, spooked by something outside the tank. 
INT. EMILY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
The bureau has been pushed in front of the deadbolted door to form a barricade. Emily lies in a fetal position on her bed, exhausted but unable to sleep. 
She tenses at the sound of a MUFFLED MALE VOICE in the other room. Comes over to the door, trying to listen. Thinks she recognizes it. 
EMILY (calls through door) Mike...? 
No reply. 
A moment of indecision then Emily tightens her grip on the screwdriver and quietly slides open the deadbolts. 
INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT 
She comes slowly down the hall, following the VOICE to its source, stops in the living room doorway, haunted... 
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
It's a different Mike Barron than last we saw. Gone is the quiet assurance. Whatever happened rocked him to the core. He closes the door for privacy. 
BARRON There's something I want you to hear. Came in at two o'clock last night. You might wanna sit. 
Emily sits. Barron cues a voicemail message on his phone, plays it over the speaker. After a BEEP we hear it. A SINISTER MALE VOICE, guttural, taunting, the voice of a DEMON: 
SINISTER MALE VOICE (mocking his earlier line) `It's hard sometimes to tell the truth, but I know you will `cause you're a good little girl...' (THEN; INTIMATE) Twenty years in the trenches, can't make Lieutenant? Hurts, doesn't it? Shakes your faith sometimes. You know why they keep passing you over? Do you, Michael? `Cause you're soft. Soft, soft, soft... 
DELIRIOUS LAUGHTER followed by a CLICK and a DIAL TONE. Emily's mouth gapes. After a moment: 
BARRON You're right. She called Doug. Took me an extra couple of days to get your cell phone records. That's what she's been using. 
Grim pause. Emily digs through her bag. Reaches the bottom. No cell phone. Staring into the bag, voice wavering with EMOTION: 
EMILY She's taking me apart, Mike. 
She loses it for a second. Barron sits in front of her on the edge of the desk. 
BARRON I'm gonna help you get to the bottom of this. 
EMILY (re: Edward's photo) He told me I have to kill her. 
Barron registers that in silence. Stuns her, and himself, by what he says next. 
BARRON I'll help you. 
Emily looks at him. Disbelief. 
BARRON Whatever it takes. 
She hugs him. A godsend. 
BARRON I'm gonna put Beth and Tim in a hotel. Keep her at the house. 
INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY 
Emily buttoning her shirt after an exam. 
DOCTOR Physically you're fine. How's the stress? 
EMILY I'm not sleeping, I was hoping you could give me something. 
The doctor writes on her prescription pad. 
DOCTOR Take one of these, you'll sleep. 
Emily watches the pen scribble. 
INT. EMILY'S CAR - DAY 
A prescription pill bottle on the passenger seat. Emily, driving home, glances at it with apprehension. 
EXT. HOTEL - NIGHT 
A high-rise hotel in downtown Los Angeles. 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 
Barron, saying goodbye to his WIFE and SON, sets down the overnight bags they've packed. 
BARRON'S WIFE Why won't you tell me what's going on? 
BARRON Because I can't. 
Kisses her. Turns to his son. 
BARRON Take care of your mom. 
Musses the boy's hair and leaves. 
INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT 
Barron strides down the corridor, his face reflecting the grim task ahead. 
INT. HOTEL PARKING STRUCTURE - NIGHT 
His footsteps echo in the parking structure as he walks along a row of parked cars. 
A faint JANGLING SOUND stops him dead in his tracks. He turns and scans the garage behind him. It's quiet, eerily still. 
He continues onward, but hears the faint JANGLING SOUND again a moment later. Spins, trying to place it. There it is again. Closer this time. Something moving, hiding, behind the rows of cars over there. 
He bends, trying to get a look under the cars. Can't see anything. Unnerved, he moves on, clicks the button on his keychain remote. The lights flash on his car fifty yards away. 
But as he continues toward it they reveal themselves, trodding into view from between the cars, CHOKE-CHAIN COLLARS JANGLING around their necks... 
THREE PIT BULLS 
SINISTER MALE VOICE ...until it's too late. 
A HAND reaches down and picks it up, a girl's hand, but the fingers as they wrap tightly around the handle look strong and sinewy. 
The feet stand motionless for a moment then turn and come toward the bed, stopping right in front of EMILY'S HORRIFIED FACE. 
A pause and then, still from Emily's POV, we see Lucy lower herself onto her knees. 
WHAM!! - with shocking force that hand IMPALES THE SCREWDRIVER IN THE WOODEN FLOOR! 
Another pause then both hands come into view, palms flat on the hardwood, as she leans her head down. 
Emily recoiling in anticipation as the face comes into view - 
LUCY'S INNOCENT FACE 
A little girl. With a little girl voice to match. 
LUCY (PLAYING MOMMY) What are you doing, you silly pumpkinhead? 
Emily, hyperventilating, stares in shock. Lucy reaches her hand in. Emily backs away, wedges herself in the corner. 
LUCY (PLAYING MOMMY) You don't want me to come under there and get you, do you? 
Emily, crying now, shakes her head. Lucy, almost sympathetic, frowns. 
LUCY (PLAYING MOMMY) I'm going to count to three. One... 
EMILY No... 
LUCY (PLAYING MOMMY) Two... Two and a half... 
EMILY Please... 
LUCY (PLAYING MOMMY) Two and three quarters... Three... 
Lucy starts crawling under the bed. 
LUCY Here I come. 
Emily tries to go backwards, but there's nowhere for her to go. 
LUCY'S FACE SLIDING CLOSER LIKE THE HEAD OF A SNAKE. 
Trapped, Emily screams. 
EMILY WHAT DO YOU WANT?!! 
Lucy stops crawling. Folds her arms, sets her chin on them. Comfortable here under the bed. Delighting in the question. 
LUCY What you wanted from your mother. I want you to love me. 
EMILY Okay... okay, I will, I will, I promise. 
Lucy weighs Emily's surrender for a moment. Then, oddly BRIGHT: 
LUCY Come tuck me in. 
EMILY Okay... I'll be right there. 
LUCY You better come. 
Lucy slithers out and we see her feet scamper from the room. Emily puts her head down on the floor and cries, covering her mouth with her hands so she won't make a sound. 
INT. EMILY'S KITCHEN - NIGHT 
A WHISTLING KETTLE on the stove. 
Emily, still in tears, takes it from the burner. Dumps SIX SLEEPING PILLS from the prescription bottle. Crushes them with the blunt edge of a knife. Stirs them into a cup of Chamomile tea. 
She freezes at a NOISE behind her. Looks tensely over her shoulder. 
The fridge. 
She adds sugar, continues stirring. 
INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT 
We follow the TEA CUP, in Emily's hand, as she comes nervously down the hall to Lucy's room. We can see Lucy in there, waiting for her in bed. Emily, playing the part, dries her eyes and enters. 
INT. LUCY'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Sits down on the bed, hands Lucy the tea. 
LUCY Chamomile. 
Emily nods. The face of a loving mother. Lucy brings the cup to her lips, pauses. 
standing on the sidewalk in her pajamas. Unscathed. 
FIRE MARSHALL Anyone else inside?! Yes or no?! 
Emily, in shock, shakes her head no. The Fire Marshall rushes off, walkie-talkie squawking. Emily stands frozen as Lucy comes through the crowd to her. More dismayed than angry. 
LUCY That was mean. 
She takes Emily's hand. Together they watch the house burn. Firelight playing on their faces. The fish bouncing off the glass in the tank at Emily's feet. 
INT. EMILY'S CAR - NIGHT 
The blue halflight before dawn. Emily and Lucy sit in the Volvo, eyeing the scorched remains of the house. The firecrew stowing equipment. Emily puts the car in drive. 
INT. EMILY'S CAR - DAWN 
The FISH FLOATING DEAD at the top of the tank in the back seat as Emily drives down the freeway at daybreak. Lucy gazing out dreamily at the sunrise. 
LUCY Maybe we can find a hotel with a swimming pool. 
Emily says nothing. Lucy turns and looks at her, thoughtful, almost empathetic. She draws up her knees and rests her chin on top, levels an appraising stare at Emily like the one she leveled at Doug. 
LUCY It's sad, isn't it? How it gets passed on. How people do to their own kids what their parents did to them. That's why you got the job... 
Emily turns on the radio, full volume, trying to drown out Lucy's voice. Lucy reaches over and turns it off. CLICK. 
LUCY ...To prove to yourself you're not like her, that you're not like your mother. Because that scares you. Scares you more than anything. 
Lucy, in mock sentiment, puts her hand on Emily's. 
LUCY I love you... even if you don't love me. 
Emily looks at her, gutted. But defiant. Turning her gaze forward, she tightens her grip on the wheel and calmly, resolutely, JAMS THE GAS PEDAL TO THE FLOOR. The acceleration pitches Lucy backwards into her seat. She sits up, eyes wide, didn't see this coming. A suicide run. 
LUCY What are you doing? Slow down. 
A tense smile from Lucy. The tables have turned. 
LUCY Did you hear me? 
Emily stares dead ahead, red-lining the tachometer. Lucy flits her eyes skyward. IMMEDIATELY IT DARKENS AND STARTS TO RAIN. Emily turns on the wipers, speeds on, unfazed. 
LUCY I said slow down! 
Emily ignores her, going eighty now, weaving through SLOWER TRAFFIC THAT FLIES TOWARD THEM OUT OF THE GRAY HAZE. Lucy, panicking, changes channels like a tv. Innocent child all of a sudden. 
LUCY Please, stop, Emily, I'll be good. 
Emily ignores her, beyond apology. And Lucy's face sharpens. She points down the road. 
LUCY Look out! 
Through the heavy rain we see - 
A TRACTOR-TRAILER RIG CRASH THROUGH THE DIVIDING MEDIAN AND JACKKNIFE, BARRELING AT THEM HEAD-ON! 
Emily goes for the brake, but reconsiders, seeing the truck for what it is: a test of faith. She welcomes it. Tightens her grip on the wheel and goes full throttle again, right at the truck. Lucy shrieks in terror. 
LUCY What are you doing?! 
EMILY It's not real. 
LUCY Yes, it is! 
EMILY Are you scared?! 
Pedal to the floor. Inviting the head-on collision. You can see the BIG RIG DRIVER in the cab, wrestling frantically with the steering wheel. Lucy bracing herself, screams - 
LUCY STOP! 
Emily clenches her teeth in anticipation of impact, of death. 
THE CHROME GRILLWORK OF THE TRUCK RUSHES TOWARD THEM IN THAT FINAL MOMENT, THE AIR HORN DEAFENINGLY LOUD! 
But the impact never comes. In the blink of an eye the truck is gone. Open road in front of them. It's not raining. Never was. The wipers SQUEAKING on a dry windshield. 
Lucy sits in silence, her bag of tricks empty. Emily, triumphant, turns to her with a vindictive smile, the speedometer hitting a hundred. 
EMILY ARE YOU SCARED?! 
She clutches Lucy's wrist. 
EMILY I'M NOT!! 
Emily jerks the car off the road, crashing through the guardrail. Trees snapping in half across the hood as they go careening through roadside woods and down a steep embankment TOWARD - 
EXT. LOS ANGELES RESERVOIR - DAY

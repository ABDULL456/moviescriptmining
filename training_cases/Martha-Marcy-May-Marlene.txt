EXT. FARM - DAY 
It is a hot summer day. A large run down farm house, several sheds, a red roof barn and a decrepid silo sit between fields of dry, uncut grass, in a serene isolated valley. 
TWO MEN tack together a broken fence that encloses an overgrown paddock. 
THREE WOMEN work in a vegetable garden. 
TWO WOMEN hang wet clothes on a clothes line. 
TWO MEN work in a cluttered garage on an old car. 
FOUR WOMEN sit in a circle on a broken down, buckling front porch. One woman breast feeds a new born. The others knit a large blanket. 
TWO WOMEN and TWO MEN swim naked in a swimming hole. 
A MAN in his forties sits alone in a room reading. 
A MAN chops wood. 
A bare foot TODDLER plays alone in the driveway. 
INT. FARM HOUSE - DAY 
A large room with unfinished wood walls has several blankets and pillows laid out like beds on the floor. 
TWO WOMEN are in the kitchen preparing food. 
MARTHA, sets a table for eight. Martha is beautiful but appears run down. She is 24 years old but her weathered face makes her look older. A bell rings off screen. 
INT. FARM HOUSE DINING ROOM - EVENING 
The men sit around a table eating dinner. 
One man sits at the head of the table, this is PATRICK. Patrick is older than the other men. To his right is WATTS, a man in his early twenties with a greasy patchy beard. 
INT. FARM HOUSE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 
The women are scattered around the kitchen waiting. The men finish dinner, pass through the kitchen and walk outside. 
The women file into the dining room, clear the men's dishes, put more chairs around the table, and bring out a new serving of food. 
INT. FARM HOUSE DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
The women sit around the table eating very small portions of low protein food. Katie sits at the head of the table. 
CUT TO: 
INT. FARM HOUSE - EARLY MORNING 
The kitchen is filled with dishes. 
TWO BABIES sleep next to each other in an old broken crib. A teenage girl sleeps on the floor next to the crib. 
People are strewn all over the house sleeping. Suddenly, a figure passes quickly through frame. 
EXT. FARM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
LUCY What do you mean? Tell me where you are and I'll come right now. 
MARTHA It's okay, you don't have to- 
LUCY I want to see you Martha. Please. 
Martha thinks for a moment. 
LUCY (CONT'D) Martha! 
INT. DINER - DAY 
Martha sits alone in a booth hunched over a grilled cheese sandwich and french fries. She devours the food like she hasn't eaten in days. 
The entrance bell rings. Martha turns around and cautiously peers over the booth. A FAMILY walks in. They are seated. Martha returns to eating. 
MAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Marcy May? 
It is Watts. His voice paralyzes her. 
WATTS What are you doin'? 
Martha stops eating. He slides into the booth and sits across from her. 
Watts reaches over and takes some french fries. He eats them slowly, enjoying every bite. She can't look at him. 
WATTS (CONT'D) We were worried about you. 
MARTHA I'm fine. 
WATTS Patrick's worried about you. 
MARTHA I just wanted to come into town. 
WATTS I could've brought you. 
MARTHA I wanted to walk. 
WATTS Through the woods? 
WAITRESS (TO WATTS) Can I get you something? 
WATTS No. 
WAITRESS (TO MARTHA) You done? 
MARTHA Yeah. 
The waitress goes to take Martha's plate. Watts puts his hand out to stop her. 
WATTS (TO MARTHA) You not gonna eat that? 
Watts takes the half grilled cheese sandwich and stuffs it into his mouth. The waitress clears the plate. 
Watts takes Martha's napkin and wipes the grease from his hands and mouth while he chews. 
WATTS (CONT'D) You ready to go? 
Martha doesn't respond. 
WATTS (CONT'D) Come on! 
MARTHA Not right now. 
Martha doesn't answer. 
LUCY (CONT'D) Your boyfriend? 
Martha nods. 
LUCY (CONT'D) Did he hurt you? 
MARTHA No! 
LUCY Are you sure? 
MARTHA No. I'm fine. 
Lucy is skeptical. 
LUCY Did you guys break up? 
Martha nods. 
LUCY (CONT'D) How long were you together? 
MARTHA A while. 
LUCY How long? 
MARTHA I don't know. Maybe a year, maybe more or less. 
LUCY And you were here the whole time? 
Martha nods. 
LUCY (CONT'D) You've been back in New York for over a year and you haven't called me? 
MARTHA I'm sorry. 
Lucy is upset but manages to remain calm. 
LUCY Well, I'm glad you're here now. 
INT. LAKE HOUSE/MARTHA'S BEDROOM - EVENING 
Lucy makes the bed. Martha enters the room wrapped in a towel. Her hair drips on the floor. 
LUCY I made you some tea. 
MARTHA Thanks. 
Lucy takes a small hand towel and dries Martha's hair. 
LUCY Ted should be up from the city soon. He'll cook us some dinner. 
MARTHA I'm pretty tired, is it okay if I just go to bed? 
LUCY Of course. (BEAT) Get some sleep, you'll be as good as new tomorrow. 
Lucy leaves. Martha gets under the sheets wrapped in her wet towel. 
INT. LAKE HOUSE KITCHEN - NIGHT 
Lucy sits at the kitchen table with a glass of RED WINE. The front door opens. She puts on a smile as TED enters. He speaks with a BRITISH ACCENT. He sets down his bag and gives her a hug and a kiss. 
TED Well? 
PATRICK Well, there you go. 
He continues to walk through the field. Zoe and Martha recline into the grass and continue talking. 
TED (O.S.) I'm going for a dip. Anyone want to join? 
MARTHA Sure. 
Martha stands up and brushes herself off. 
MARTHA (CONT'D) You coming? 
EXT. LAKE HOUSE DOCK - CONTINUOUS 
Martha turns to Zoe but Lucy is there instead, lying on the sun bed, lost in her book. Lucy does not answer. 
Ted runs down the dock and dives into the water. Martha follows. Ted looks back to see Martha stand at the end of the dock, take off her clothes and dive in naked. 
Martha swims, lost in her own world. 
Lucy notices Martha, grabs a towel, and walks down to the end of the dock. Ted swims back and gets out. 
TED (SMIRKING) Brilliant choice of swim wear. 
Lucy is not amused. Ted walks away laughing. He turns to sneak one more glimpse of Martha. 
LUCY Martha! What are you doing? 
MARTHA What? 
LUCY Would you put some clothes on, you can't swim naked. 
MARTHA Why? 
LUCY You just can't. There are kids around and people come by. 
MARTHA So? 
LUCY So you can't. We don't, just don't. I have a bathing suit you can borrow. 
Martha gets out of the water. Lucy wraps the towel around her and walks away. Martha dries off. She feels embarrassed. 
INT. LAKE HOUSE/MARTHA'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON 
Martha sleeps. Lucy notices the bruising on Martha's ear. 
LUCY Martha! (BEAT) I've been trying to wake you. You should get up or you won't sleep through the night. 
Martha wakes up. 
LUCY (CONT'D) You should eat. 
MARTHA I will. I'm just going to sleep a little more first okay? 
LUCY Okay. I'm sorry I got frustrated with you before. 
MARTHA It's okay. 
Lucy leaves. Martha opens the window and dumps the pasta outside then goes back to sleep. 
INT. LAKE HOUSE DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
TED She's not coming? 
KATIE It's okay, you'll find your role. It takes time for people to find their role in a new family. 
Katie pours the cleaner on the floor, it sloshes around. 
KATIE (CONT'D) We sell blankets in town. We still need some money, but when the farm's up and running we'll be self sufficient and we'll never have to worry about it again. 
MARTHA When do you think that'll happen? 
KATIE Hopefully by the end of the summer but we'll see. It's hard to get machinery and live stock without cash. 
MARTHA That'll be nice. 
Katie accidentally drops a plate. 
KATIE Shoot. 
Martha gets down and starts to clean it up. 
EXT. FARM - DAY 
Martha, Watts, Max, Zoe and a few others sit around and listen to two men play guitar. Everyone is talking and laughing and having a nice time. 
Patrick approaches. He observes everyone for a moment, he seems agitated. He speaks above everyone and above the music. 
PATRICK How's everything going so far Marcy May? 
MARTHA Good. 
The guys stop playing music. 
PATRICK You like it here? 
MARTHA Yeah, it's really nice. 
PATRICK I want you to feel at home. 
MARTHA I do. Thanks. 
PATRICK People have abandoned you your whole life. I don't blame you for not trusting anyone. 
MARTHA What? 
PATRICK If you ever want to have a meaningful relationship, you need to let your guard down. 
Martha is embarrassed and feels on the spot. 
PATRICK (CONT'D) It's not your fault, but it's there. If you feel safe here, and I think you do, let us in. We just want to help you. 
ZOE Yeah, we think you're fucking awesome. 
PATRICK If you're going to live here then really be apart of things. 
INT. LAKE HOUSE KITCHEN - MORNING 
Lucy is putting away groceries. Martha enters. 
LUCY Good morning. How are you feeling today? 
MARTHA Good. 
LUCY There's this great juice shop in town, I got us a couple of juices. (MORE) 
LUCY (CONT'D) This one is Kale with ginseng. It gives me energy, so I thought it might help you. 
LUCY She's not that bad. 
MARTHA You never had to live with her. 
TED You lived with Dora? 
MARTHA She lived with me after mom died. 
TED (TO LUCY) Where were you? 
LUCY College. 
Lucy picks up her Polaroid camera and frames up Martha. 
LUCY (CONT'D) Well I'm sure she'd love to know you're okay. 
MARTHA (SMILING) She hates me. 
LUCY She doesn't hate you. (BEAT) Look at me. 
MARTHA I hate her. 
Martha notices the camera and quickly turns away. 
LUCY Relax, I don't have any pictures of you. (LUCY FOCUSES) Jesus you're gorgeous. It's annoying. 
Martha cracks a smile. Lucy snaps the shot. 
LUCY (CONT'D) There you go! 
Lucy hands Martha the Polaroid, she shakes it. 
LUCY (CONT'D) Don't shake it, that's a myth. 
Martha looks deep in thought, she continues to shake the Polaroid. 
MARTHA Is it true married people don't fuck? 
LUCY What? No! 
Ted walks back to the front of the boat and looks at Martha's ass as he passes. Martha is embarrassed. She stares at the Polaroid. 
INT. LAKE HOUSE/TED AND LUCY'S BEDROOM - DAY 
Martha sits on the bed watching Lucy go through her closet looking at old clothes. Lucy holds up a summer dress. 
LUCY Put this on. 
MARTHA You're kidding. 
LUCY Your clothes are disgusting Martha, just try it. 
MARTHA Why does it matter? 
LUCY It just feels good to put on something nice and comfortable. 
Martha slips on the dress and a funny pose. 
LUCY (CONT'D) It looks good you little shit. 
MARTHA Whatever makes you happy mama bear. 
LUCY You're making fun of me and I think it looks really good. 
MARTHA Really? 
ZOE Yeah, it's so special. 
MARTHA I can't remember anything, I just woke up on the floor and felt this pain - 
ZOE That's the cleansing. It's good. It means it's working if you can't remember things. You're cleansing yourself of the past and the toxins. 
Martha is distant. 
ZOE (CONT'D) You need to share yourself, don't be so selfish. 
MARTHA I'm not. 
ZOE So smile then, enjoy this amazing night. It only happens once. 
Zoe rests her forehead against Martha's forehead. They curl up together in a very intimate way. 
Martha smiles. Zoe kisses her on the lips. Martha is caught off guard. She laughs. They have a second peck on the lips before closing their eyes to sleep. 
EXT. FARM - DAY 
The group sits around listening to Max finish playing a song. Everyone claps for him. Patrick, who sits in the back, stands up and walks up to the stage. Everyone gets excited. 
He tunes his guitar. 
PATRICK This one's called Marcy's song. 
Martha sits in the back listening. Everyone turns around to look at her. She watches on as Patrick begins to play. 
The song is a beautiful, intense and haunting folk song. The whole group is entranced. Martha is mesmerized by him. 
PATRICK (CONT'D) Well she, she's just a picture. Who lives on my wall Well she, she's just a picture And the reason, reason, reason it is so small. With a smile so inviting and a body so tall, She, she's just a picture Just a picture THAT'S ALL 
Well you stand there, stand there with the nightshade, Her dripping ripping down your hands And you ask me, ask me about the LIGHTNING And the lady, lady, lady she understands It's a dream for the future and the water for the sands And the strangeness is wandering Through many callin' lands 
INT. LAKE HOUSE KITCHEN - DAY 
Ted walks into the kitchen. 
Martha is on her hands and knees scrubbing the kitchen floor. 
Ted gets a six pack out of the fridge. He cracks a beer and drinks it. 
TED What are you doing? 
MARTHA Cleaning. (BEAT) I thought I'd help out more. 
TED Alright. I'm going to take the boat out, do you want to come? 
MARTHA Is Lucy coming? 
TED She had to run to the city. 
MARTHA Oh. 
TED I'll teach you how to drive the boat, come on. 
MARTHA It's okay. 
TED Come on. 
EXT. BOAT - DAY 
TED It's good to let people know where you are Martha. People worry. 
MARTHA I didn't think Lucy would worry about me. 
TED Well, she did. 
There is another awkward silence. They both drink their beer. 
MARTHA Can I go swimming? 
TED You don't need to ask. 
Martha takes off her clothes. She is wearing a bikini that Lucy gave her. It does not quite fit. The bathing suit sags and top of her ass shows. Ted tries not to look. 
THE CAMERA FOLLOWS HER AS SHE DIVES UNDER WATER. 
EXT. FARM SWIMMING HOLE - DAY 
Martha brings her head above water and she is with a group of people from the farm swimming in a swimming hole. 
Martha watches as Watts jumps off the cliff into the water. Everyone cheers him on. Patrick swims up behind Martha. 
PATRICK You jump yet? 
MARTHA No. 
PATRICK Go on. 
Watts swims by and guides her out of the water. 
Watts and Martha ascend up a narrow dirt path to the top of a rock face. 
WATTS You ready? 
MARTHA I can't. 
WATTS Sure you can. 
Watts jumps. Martha stands alone at the top of the cliff naked. 
Everyone is looking up at her cheering her on. She builds up the courage and jumps. 
She hits the water, everything goes dark. The frame fills with tiny bubbles, she comes up for air exhilarated. She continues to swim, the camera follows her under water. The darkness of the water makes the screen go black. 
INT. FARM HOUSE - NIGHT 
The hallway is dark, the space is unclear. Martha walks down a hallway and we learn it's the farm house. She walks into Patrick's room. She get's into bed with him and curls up in his arms and falls asleep. She looks safe and happy. He welcomes her, the room looks warm and comforting. 
CUT TO: 
INT. LAKE HOUSE/MARTHA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Martha sleeps. THUMP. Something hits the roof. Martha wakes up. THUMP, ROLL. Martha sits up and listens. She waits in anticipation. THUMP. 
INT. LUCY AND TED'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Martha walks down the dark hallway and slowly opens the door to Ted and Lucy's room. 
Ted and Lucy are having sex. Martha watches for a moment, then creeps into the room and quietly curls up on the edge of the bed. 
Lucy does not see Martha. Ted does not say anything, he continues to have sex with Lucy. His motion becomes harder, Lucy opens her eyes and Ted jumps up. 
LUCY (STARTLED) What? What? 
INT. LAKE HOUSE LIVING ROOM - MORNING 
Ted is half asleep on the couch. Lucy sits to wake him. Martha is lying in their bed listening to them through the cracked doorway. 
LUCY I'm sorry you slept out here. Thanks for being patient. 
TED I don't have much choice do I? 
LUCY I just want to make sure she's okay. 
TED I get two weeks a year to come out here and try to relax before I have to go back to work! 
LUCY I know. 
TED I am under so much pressure right now- 
LUCY I know you are. 
TED I have a month to get this building up and running or the bank takes it. 
LUCY That has nothing to do with Martha. 
TED My point is, I don't need the extra stress. 
LUCY I'm her only family. She needs to be able to depend on me right now. (BEAT) It's complicated Ted. 
TED As complicated as it might be, we can't just keep ignoring the fact that her behavior is fucking insane. 
Martha pretends to go back to sleep. 
EXT. LAKE HOUSE GARDEN - DAY 
Lucy works in the garden. Martha walks over to help. 
MARTHA Do you ever hear things hitting the roof at night? 
LUCY No. Maybe it's the pine cones. (BEAT) Where did you pick up gardening? 
MARTHA We had a garden where I lived? 
LUCY You're good. 
MARTHA I'm good at some things. 
LUCY I know you are. 
They continue to work. Lucy builds up the courage. 
LUCY (CONT'D) Was he ever physical with you? 
MARTHA Who? 
LUCY Your boyfriend. 
MARTHA What do you mean? 
LUCY Did he ever, hit you? 
MARTHA No.

Martha feels her ear. 
Martha picks one up, she is very natural with him. 
MARTHA He only has boys. 
SARAH You're good with them. 
MARTHA You want to hold him? 
SARAH No Thanks. (BEAT) I don't have to take care of them do I? 
MARTHA Not if you don't want to. There are plenty of jobs to be done. (BEAT) You'll find your role. It takes time for people to find their role in a new family. 
EXT. FARM HOUSE - DAY 
Martha walks with Sarah and Zoe across the courtyard and out into the field towards the woods. 
ZOE (TO MARTHA) I called my dad today to ask for money. 
MARTHA Does Patrick know? 
ZOE He asked me to. Sometimes, if there's something we really need I'll call. 
MARTHA How was it? 
ZOE Fine, they're not bad people. 
MARTHA Did he give you the money? 
ZOE Yeah. He thinks I'm on drugs. 
MARTHA Do you tell him you're not? 
ZOE No, that's why he gives it to me. I guess he'd rather pay for it than think I'm sucking dick for it. 
SARAH I've done drugs. Not a lot but I've tried everything pretty much, except heroin. 
ZOE It's good to try everything at least once. You find out who you are that way. What about drinking, do you drink? 
SARAH I have, but I don't. 
ZOE Good, we don't drink. It just makes you angry and less focused. 
MARTHA Don't get the wrong idea Sarah. We don't talk to our old families. 
SARAH I wouldn't call my Dad anyway, no matter how much he paid me. 
Patrick and Watts walk out of the woods. 
PATRICK Hey. 
MARTHA Hi Patrick, Did you meet Sarah yet? 
PATRICK Sally, yeah.

MARTHA Shouldn't we start cooking? 
LUCY I just made some potato salad. Ted's cooking the fish. 
MARTHA I thought we were going to cook. 
LUCY We cooked last night. 
MARTHA Oh, yeah. 
Martha is lost deep in thought. 
MARTHA (CONT'D) Do you ever have this thing where you can't tell if something's a memory or if it's something you've dreamed? 
LUCY Not really. 
Beat. 
LUCY (CONT'D) Do you blame me for anything? 
MARTHA No. (BEAT) Like what? 
LUCY I don't know. (BEAT) I'm just trying to figure out why we stopped talking. 
MARTHA I didn't think about it. 
LUCY Really? 
MARTHA We were far apart. 
LUCY Sometimes I wonder if, maybe I could have taken better care of you. 
MARTHA (MUMBLES) The past doesn't matter. 
LUCY It does matter. 
MARTHA I took care of myself. 
LUCY I know you did. I think I could have done more though. 
MARTHA Stop it. 
LUCY Be honest with me, you never think about it? 
MARTHA No. 
LUCY You're not angry at me? 
MARTHA I know you don't think much of me but I knew what I was doing then and I still do. 
LUCY No, Martha, I think the world of you, I'm just wondering if I should have come back and kept you in school and helped you go to college, you had so much potential. 
MARTHA I don't need your guidance, I never did. I'm a teacher and a leader, you just never let me be that but now I know I am, I know who I am. 
LUCY Teacher and a leader? What are you talking about? I always encouraged you to do more, but you shut me out. 
Martha doesn't respond she drifts off into deep thought. 
LUCY (CONT'D) MARTHA- 
MARTHA Who's this? 
WOMAN Who's this? (BEAT) Zoe? 
MARTHA She not there? 
WOMAN She's not. 
MARTHA Where is she? 
WOMAN Who is this? 
MARTHA Who is this?

Martha hangs up. The phone rings. She unplugs the phone and collapses on the floor. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. FARM - DAY 
Martha and the others are practicing pick pocketing. Martha looks out into the feild to see Patrick talking with Sarah. She is enamoured by him. 
EXT. FARM FIELD - DAY 
Zoe, Martha, Sarah and MAX are shooting bottles in the woods. 
MAX Watts said I'm supposed to teach you how to defend yourselves but I think you're hopeless. 
ZOE I'm surprised your dumb ass even knows how to load it. 
MAX Please, I'm like Doc fuckin' Holiday. 
Zoe shoots and hits a bottle. He comes up behind Zoe, wraps his arms around her, kisses her neck and gropes her breasts. She moves his hands away. Sarah watches on. 
MAX (CONT'D) God, you are so hot when you shoot, makes my willy hard. 
Max takes the gun out of her hand and fires several shots. He misses the bottles. 
ZOE What happened Doc? I should be teaching you. 
He loads another round, aims, shoots, and hits a bottle. 
MARTHA Alright, my turn. 
Max wraps his hands around hers so she is firmly gripping the gun. 
ZOE (PLAYFUL) Alright Max, was this just an excuse to grope Marcy. 
MAX I'm teaching her how to shoot. Then you just squeeeeeeeeeze. 
Patrick is walking towards them carrying a sac. Martha fires a few shots and misses. 
PATRICK Focus. Take a deep breath. Think about someone who wronged you. Feel it, feel how they made you feel in your stomach. Take a deep breath, feel it all moving out into your hands. Let it build. It's transferring to the gun, building in the gun. Now release. 
She fires five powerful shots quickly, one shatters. A smile grows on martha's face. 
PATRICK (CONT'D) (SMILING) Feels good right? 
Martha nods. Patrick opens a sac and lets 2 cats out. 
PATRICK (CONT'D) Now try that. 
MARTHA Max, they're not rules. It's just common sense. 
MAX It feels like rules. They won't let me do anything. I can't even go on the house runs. I'd be great at taking shit. 
MARTHA It's not about taking shit. 
MAX Sounds like it's about taking shit to me. 
MARTHA And that's why you don't get to come. You just don't get it. (BEAT) You need to quit drinking. 
MAX I'm not drinking. 
Martha takes the bottle out from under a hay bale. 
MARTHA You're still living with all the shit you carried out there. You're the only one, let it go. 
MAX I'll try. 
MARTHA No. You can't try. You have to stop. They love you, they just want you to be stronger. 
MAX I'm strong, they'll see. 
Max leans up and tries to kiss her. Martha stops him. She hugs him instead. 
MARTHA You'll be okay.

LUCY You can not be serious right now. 
TED What? 
Beat. 
TED (CONT'D) Lucy! 
LUCY One minute you're going after Martha at the dinner table, then you're curling up together on the couch? 
TED No one was curling up with anybody. 
LUCY You really do think I'm stupid don't you? 
TED Jesus, I couldn't sleep, I was watching a movie, she came out and sat down and started watching with me. What am I supposed to do, tell her to leave? 
Beat. 
TED (CONT'D) You're being ridiculous. 
LUCY You can lose your temper at will but when I get pissed off, I'm being crazy or ridiculous! I couldn't possibly be mad for a reason. 
Lucy gets undressed and gets in the shower. 
TED Are you accusing me of something? Because if you are, I'd like you to say it out loud so you can hear how absurd it sounds. 
LUCY Fuck you. I just want you to think about how walking in on that might make me feel. 
TED You ask me to make more of an effort. I try to do that and you get upset. I can't win. 
LUCY You're unbelievable. 
EXT. LAKE HOUSE ROAD - DAY 
Ted runs. 
EXT. LAKE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
Lucy sits on the steps overlooking the lake. She is sneaking in a cigarette. 
EXT. LAKE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
Martha stands below her bedroom window to see what's hitting the roof at night. She turns and looks over to the back road. The brown car is parked on the side road. 
It is overcast. It looks like a storm is approaching. 
EXT. LAKE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
Martha walks towards the car, her anger is building. As she gets to the top of the road she picks up a rock and throws it through the car window. Glass shatters everywhere. 
She picks up a loose shard of glass and scrapes a line on the side of the car. She drops the glass and stares at the mess for a moment before looking around to make sure no one has seen her. 
INT. LAKE HOUSE - DAY 
Martha looks out the window at the brown car with the smashed window. It is raining. 
INT. LAKE HOUSE - NIGHT 
Martha lies in bed. Something thumps on the roof. Martha flinches. THUMP. THUMP. THUMP. She flintches with each thump. 
There is a long silence. Martha is clearly not okay. 
PATRICK You know that death is the most beautiful part of life, right? Death is beautiful because everyone fears death. And fear is the greatest human emotion of all because it creates complete awareness. When you're scared it forces you to be completely aware of your surroundings and the moment you're in. It brings you to NOW and that makes you truly present. And when you are truly present, that's nirvana, that's pure love. So, death is pure love. 
CUT TO:

Men are moving vehicles into the garage. Women are bringing the clothes inside off the clothes line. Martha is helping with the garden. There is a sense of urgency to close the farm. 
Max is in the hayloft trying to close the loft door. He slips and falls 30 feet to the ground. Martha rushes over to him. He is in pain. Watts comes out of the barn. 
MARTHA We have to do something. 
WATTS He's fine. Right Max? 
MAX Yeah, I'm cool. 
They help him up and he falls. He cant put pressure on his leg and he seems to have a concussion. 
MARTHA Watts! 
WATTS There's nothing to do Marcy, you need to get inside. Max is strong, he'll be fine. Right? 
MAX Yeah, I'm good Marcy. Stop. 
EXT. FARM BASEMENT DOORWAY - DAY 
Everyone files into the basement except for Patrick, Watts and Katie. They stand at the top of the stairs talking. 
INT. FARM HOUSE BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS 
MARTHA How long do you think we'll be down here? 
ZOE It'll just be a few days. Just to be safe. 
INT. FARM HOUSE BASEMENT - NIGHT 
WATTS (CONT'D) Hey. 
Martha just stands there quietly. 
INT. FARM HOUSE KITCHEN - EVENING 
Martha cooks with Katie. 
Martha sneaks a bite of bread. Katie whacks her in the ear with a wooden spoon. A slight ringing remains throughout the scene. 
KATIE Nothing till they're done. You know better. 
MARTHA I know. Sorry Katie. 
LUCY (O.S.) Who's Katie? 
INT. LAKE HOUSE KITCHEN - NIGHT 
Martha turns her head to see Lucy instead of Katie. Martha is at the lake house cooking with Lucy. 
MARTHA What? 
LUCY Who's Katie? 
MARTHA Oh, nothing. 
Beat. 
MARTHA (CONT'D) Lucy? 
LUCY Yeah. 
MARTHA Is this from the past or is this now? 
LUCY What? 
MARTHA I don't remember waking up this morning. 
LUCY Why don't you go sit down, I'll finish up. 
Lucy hands water and some pills to Martha. Martha takes the pills, walks into the other room and collapses on the couch in front of the television. 
Ted walks into the kitchen. Martha listens from the couch. 
He reaches out and holds her hand. 
TED What's going on? 
LUCY Who the fuck knows. 
TED She needs to see someone. 
LUCY I know. 
TED I'll start looking into places tomorrow. We can arrange for her to be somewhere by Wednesday. 
LUCY Places? 
TED I don't think she should stay with us anymore. We can't do anything for her when she's like this. 
Lucy goes back to chopping. 
LUCY I don't want to talk about it anymore. 
Ted gets up slowly. 
LUCY Are you alright? 
Ted pushes Lucy off of him. 
LUCY (CONT'D) What the fuck happened? 
TED She kicked me down the stairs. Jesus Christ, what's it going to take, Lucy. 
Martha starts crying, she becomes hysterical. Lucy is irate, she runs up the stairs and confronts Martha. 
LUCY You could have killed him. 
Martha backs away. 
MARTHA I was confused. 
LUCY About what, what are you so confused about? 
MARTHA I thought he was someone else. 
Lucy's anger is building. 
LUCY You thought he was someone else? What is wrong with you? (BEAT) I'm not doing this anymore, I'm not doing this anymore. I beat myself up over you for years and I'm sick of it, I'm sick of chasing you down and worrying about you. I need to move on. 
MARTHA I'm sorry. 
LUCY You need help Martha. 
MARTHA I know. 
LUCY What happened to you? 
Martha shakes her head with a severe look of fear in her eyes. 
LUCY (CONT'D) What happened to you? 
MARTHA (SCREAMING) I don't know. 
Lucy doesn't know what else to do, she can see Martha is too far gone. 
LUCY We're going to get you proper help. 
There is a long moment of silence. 
MARTHA Are you going to send me away? 
LUCY I don't know how to help you anymore. 
MARTHA (PLEADING) Please don't. Please don't. 
LUCY I can't help you. 
MARTHA Please, I can't be alone, please. 
LUCY We're trying to start a family and I don't trust you to be here. 
Lucy walks away. 
MARTHA Lucy? 
LUCY What?

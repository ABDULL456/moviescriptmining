INT. PIER BUILDING - DAY 
BANG!! A shock chord as we cut from black to a harshly toplit 
CLOSE SHOT: A man is talking into a cellular phone. He is a paunchy but powerful looking black man, bald with a gray fringe. His baldness makes his head look muscular; he is a tough man whose life has been shaped by the violence of the docks. His name is EDDIE BLACK. In the distance a foghorn moans. We are pulling back. 
BLACK Yeah. .'Cause he's an asshole. Tell him no... Tell him no too... Him, tell fuck you... Yeah... Uh huh... The continuing pull back shows that we are inside a huge empty pier building. Black is leaning against the roof of his car, which is parked in the middle of the vast empty space. The room is lit by bare bulbs, its farthest reaches falling into darkness. 
BLACK No, I'll be a few minutes here. Guy comin' up, thinks he's gonna muscle me outs my property... Does it matter? Just another tough guy...Yeah, okay... Another hard-looking man is approaching.

MAN They're drivin' up. Black nods. 
BLACK Get their pieces. We got a surprise for those fuckers. 
2 EXT WHARF - DAY We are tracking towards a chain link fence which is swinging open to admit two midnight blue Lincoln Continentals. The cars stop in the foreground and eight men get out, eerily backlit in the mist of the riverfront. 
3 SLOW TRACKING - ROBERT G. DURANT is a well-dressed and immaculately groomed man of forty. 
4 SLOW TRACKING - RUDY GUZMAN wears a powder blue, polyester leisure suit. His nose has been broken several times from his years in the Mexican boxing league. He was almost a contender. 
5 SLOW TRACKING - SKIP NATICK walks with a pronounced limp. 
6 SLOW TRACKING - TRUMAYNE JOHNSON MC SAM is a large black man with a quiet, studied cool. 
7 SLOW TRACKING - RICK is a wiry twenty-year old who looks about in short, jerky motions. He huddles in behind the others. He is stylishly dressed, with slicked back, black hair. His protruding Adams apple bobs as he swallows. 
B SLOW TRACKING - SMILEY 8 wears a permanent psychotic smile. 
9 SLOW TRACKING - PAULY 9 is middle-aged and balding. His spare tire hangs over the edge of his suit pants. He subdues a belch. He raises a bottle of Maalox and slugs down fifty cents worth. A ring of white chalky fluid coats his lips. 
10 SLOW TRACKING - CORKY CORCORAN 10 has a thatch of blond hair, he spits out tobacco juice between his wide spaced front teeth. 11 They are approached by a group of fifteen dock workers, 11 Black's men, with massive shoulders and grain-sack bellies. Looks like they just got off their shift and now they're ready to kick some ass. 
DOCK WORKER Okay, against the car, ladies. You're c gonna stand for a search. 12 The eight visitors assume the position, placing their 12 hands on the roof of their car. The dock workers pat them down and haul off iron -- lots of it. 
DOCK WORKER #2 Bunch a cuties. 
DOCK WORKER #3 Put skirts on 'em, I'd marry one. From the other Dock Workers, hearty male laughter. The visitors bare up in silence. 
13 INT PIER BUILDING -- NIGHT 13 As the visitors are led in, into the beams of the car headlights, escorted by the dock workers. The Dock Workers take up positions around Durant and his men. 
14 BLACK stands waiting for them. He eyes Skip, the limper. 
BLACK Bum leg? 
SKIP No leg. 
BLACK 
(CONVERSATIONALLY) I was engaged to a girl with a wooden leg once. Skip brightens. 
SKIP 
(INTERESTED) Yeah? What happened? 
BLACK I hadda break it off. 
15 The dock workers laugh. Black indulges his wens' laughter, then cuts 
BLACK okay, let's cut the crap here. Durant, I got just three things to say to you. One He holds up a chubby finger. 
BLACK I ain't selling my property. He flashes a second finger. 
BLACK Two. Nobody muscles Eddie Black Especially a bunch of fucks. He flashes a third finger. 
BLACK 
PPY Number three, if you guys is unha with that, which I can already is, then we can cutcha balls of f if that'll be more satisfactory. 
19 CONTINUED The last shot echoes away to leave silence -- except for the arhythmic echoing scuffle of Skip's one shoe, as he continues to hop in place for balance. Smiley, after a watchful pause to make sure everyone is dead, sticks out his left arm at waist level. Skip grabs the arm for support, stops hopping, and there is now...total silence. 
ROBERT G. DURANT the elegantly suited leader, takes out a cigar and a gold-plated cigar trimmer. SNIP--he trims the and of the cigar, and sticks it in his mouth. As he walks towards the dumbly apprehensive Black: 
DURANT Now let's consider my points, one by one... 
GUZMAN puts a full nelson on Black. Trumayne, grabs Black's right hand and holds it out, fingers splayed, towards Durant. 
DURANT One... He slips one of Black's fingers into his cigar trimmer. 
DURANT .1 try not to let my anger get the better of me. SNIP! Black screams. As Durant goes for another finger: 
DURANT ...Two: I don't always succeed. SNIP! Black screams. Reaching for another finger: 
DURANT ...Three: I've got seven more points. 
2 0 EXT WHARF - DAY - LONG SHOT Looking down on the lonely waterfront building, we hear Black's screams. 
CUT TO: 
PEYTON Pacing, thinking; 
PEYTON Why? What is destabilizing it? Vivification process was cake. Tissue rejection? We licked that. We're close. We're smart guys. So why can't we make these cells stable? Hokay. Let's try a ten percent alkalinity. Get those suckers too drunk to fragment. 
YAKITITO posts the completed lab sheet on a wall covered with hundreds of similar sheets. 
YAKITITO We already try ten. He pokes at a section of lab sheets. 
YAKITITO And twenty. And twenty-two... We try all phase of alkalinity. He punches the wall. CONTINUED 
32 CONTINUED 
YAKITITO But still a ninety-nine minute! Three month ago, ninety nine minute. Ten month ago... ninety nine minute... BAM BAM... Yakitito punches the wall again and again. Peyton calmly taps a plastic dunking bird that slowly bobs. 
PEYTON A word of advice, Yakitito. Don't get emotionally involved. Watch. Analyze. Remain object --- 
BAM! He is cut off as Yakitito punches the wall again and again to punctuate his speech. 
YAKITITO Maybe I am lousy scientist. 
MAYBEOI listen to father, get in Anaheim! Get drunk on Sake nightly, forget I am failure! 
PEYTON Quick, Yakitito. A basketball appears in Peyton's hands. He tosses it to 
CAMERA. 
YAKITITO Catches the ball. 
PEYTON The most striking characteristic of thermionic emission. 
YAKITITO Throws the ball away. 
YAKITITO 
KE No, always you ask me question to ma me calm down! I no want to calm down! 
CONTINUED 
32 CONTINUED(3) 
PEYTON catches the ball, dribbles and throws it back to Yakitito. 
PEYTON The answer, Yakitito. 
YAXITITO snags the ball angrily from the air. 
YAKITITO 
(FURIOUS) It is most strongly depending on temperature! He throws it at Peyton, who grabs it, and pump-fakes Yakitito, not letting him have the ball. 
PEYTON Go on! Again he pump-fakes. Yakitito flinches. 
YAKITITO This means the temperature of the emitter is not critical as long as it is sufficiently high and as long as pure metals with high operating temperatures such as tungsten or tantalum are used. Peyton tosses him the ball. Yakitito catches it. Calm now. He blinks. 
YAKITITO Amazing. It work every time.

33 INT. HUNT CLUB LOBBY- DAY 
LOUIS STRACK SR., a no-nonsense octogenarian, and his son, LOUIS STRACK JR., a powerfully built, debonair fifty, stride into the lobby. They are accompanied by a couple of aides. 
CONTINUED 
33 CONTINUED JULIE HASTINGS, a young attractive woman who has apparently been awaiting their arrival rises from a chair and crosses the lobby to greet them. She is dressed in a conservative business suit and carries a briefcase. 
JULIE Mr. Strack, my name is Julie Hastings. I'm here from Pappas and Swain to represent you in the Von Hoffenstein negotiation. 
STRACK JR. How do you do? And please, call me Louis. This is my father who-- Strack Sr. interrupts his son's introduction. 
STRACK SR. I don't want some fancy-ass woman to do my negotiating. Where's Herb Gorson? 
JULIE Gorson's tied up in litigation this week. Don't worry--I've done my homework. 
STRACK SR. scowls, ungraciously accepting her. 
STRACK SR. 
(TO JULIE) I'll stop worrying when you get Von Balibreaker's price down to sixty million... He turns and starts striding down the hallway, the others following. 
STRACK SR. .If he goes that low, lock him up. 
34 INT HUNT CLUB PRIVATE DINING. ROOM - DAY The Stracks and Julie are seated at a table next to a large picture window that looks out on the bridle path. Jodhpured equestrians gallop past in the distance. Seated across from them are Baron Hugo Von Hoffenstein, a bald, hook-nosed Austrian aristocrat with a patrician air and cold beady eyes. He is accompanied by his attorney Myron Katz. Liveried waiters are just clearing the table and serving coffee. 
KATZ We want to be reasonable here. We said we were interested in selling the pier frontage and we are interested in selling. But frankly Mr. Von .will not be robbed. Seventy-five strikes us as a fair price for this parcel. We're ready to conclude a deal here and now at that price. 
PLEASANTLY: 
JULIE Then I guess we're only missing one element here. 
KATZ What's that? 
JULIE An interested party. Strack Jr. tries to suppress a smile. Waiters bring in the wine and pour a tasting portion for Von Hoffenstein, silent, coldly watchful. He rolls the wine in his glass, eyes appraising Julie. He takes a sip, cocks his head, nods. Wine is poured around. 
JULIE .Mr. Katz, I've found that in the real estate business, three factors determine a property's worth. CONTINUED

34 CONTINUED Katz leans forward, listening. 
VOICE In the case of these two--a rare phenomenon--it lasted twenty years. 
JULIE Although we broke up sixteen times. Sunset and distorted music. 
VOICE 
TUA Part two. Mating rumpled bed, The sunset is replaced by a shot of Julie on a working on legal briefs, a camera-faced shadow crossing the image. 
VOICE Certain objects develop a special, shared meaning to lovers. Here are some objects significant to our test subjects. Shot of coffee-rings on a table. 
VOICE The coffee rings Peyton tends to leave. They irritate Julie, and he leaves them everywhere! Quick shots. Coffee rings on a lab report. Coffee rings on a book-shelf. Coffee rings on a wall and ceiling. Julie laughs. 
CONTINUED 
52 CONTINUED(4) 
VOICE Yet such minor irritations can strangely become endearing to the other mate. 
JULIE Not just yet they haven't. The slide changes to a shot of a bottle covered in wax. 
VOICE The bottle of Dom Perignon Champagne Julie gave Peyton for his twenty-first birthday. Now it serves as a candle holder. 
QUIETLY; 
JULIE I never gave you that. The champagne bottle is replaced by a shot of a record album turning on a player. The music plays over the image. Haunting. Romantic. 
VOICE Finally, the single Love in the ark The song continues. Julie smiles, swept away by it. 
VOICE This song was playing when the two first kissed. A high school prom picture comes up on the screen. Peyton in an awkwardly fitting tux and Julie, a blossoming beauty. In the slide, they have been caught kissing. 
VOICE Now let us leave our test-subjects. The sunset again. ov in the Dark theme plays over it,. and eventually fades away.

52 CONTINUED(5) 
VOICE Love. It's fundamental nature still eludes modern Science. Yet researchers across the globe continue to study this ancient and powerful phenomenon. Hoping one day, to unlock love's mystery. Credits come on. A Westlake/Yanagita Presentation. Etc. Peyton The lights in the lab come on. Julie turns around. steps out from behind the slide projector. 
PEYTON Pretty stupid, huh? 
JULIE I thought it was beautiful- 
PEYTON Yakitito helped. I just wanted you to see it. It was just something I wanted you to. . know. 
JULIE I know. Peyton wraps his arms about her. Julie moves close and they kiss.

CUT TO: 
55 INT WESTLAKE LAB - MORNING 55 Sunshine streams through the sheers of the window onto Julie's shoulder. She sits on the bed going over some papers, her expression increasingly disturbed. Julie punches a number into the phone. 
JULIE .Dale Gorson, please... Peyton's hand enters with a mug of coffee, which he sets on the papers in front of her. 
JULIE Peyton! Julie takes the mug away; it has indeed left a brown circle on the topmost memo. Julie smiles at him. Then: 
JULIE Dale? Yes, Julie Hastings... yes, I found some memos researching the Von Hoffenstein deal that I don't think I was supposed to find... From the late Mr. Strack to a guy named Claude Bellasarious. They're records of payments to various people on the zoning commission... Peyton, behind her, massages her back. 
JULIE .They look like payoffs. Suspicious, at the very least... Well, the way I'd like to proceed is to talk to Strack's son first... Give him the benefit of the doubt. Under the circumstances, it's the least I can do. She hangs up. Peyton kisses her. She leans back into his arms and closes her eyes blissfully. Reluctantly, she rises and slips on her shoes. Peyton watches her admiring everything about her. She gracefully lays her legal papers in her briefcase and heads for the door. Half way out the door she turns to Peyton.

(Revised Scene is 2-17-89) 
55 CONTINUED Bye. I'll call l you tonight. Maybe we can get together. She exits. 
PEYTON The sound of the closing door echos. He sits alone on the ksd, looking about the empty apartment and lab beyond. 
56 EXT. CITY STREET - MORNING 56 
JULIE In an impressive corporate power suit, briefcase in hand, walks briskl y down the sunny sidewalk, stopping at the intersection to sig nal a cab Suddenly, running up behind her.. 
57 PEYTON 57 Dressed in jeans and sweatshirt, hurries to catch up to her. 
PEYTON Julie, wait! She is opening the cab door when she turns to him. 
JULIE What's the matter? 
PEYTON I've been thinking. Maybe we should get married. 
58 JULIE 58 Freezes half in and half out of the cab door. Panicked. 
58 CONTINUED 
JULIE Marriage--well, we could do that--of course, there's our careers--I men, I'm just starting to get things going at the firm. And, you know, I kind of like having my own 
PLACE -- 
PEYTON 'We're practically living together now. All marriage means is you answer the phone in the and if you to pretend grandmother, it's a wrong number. The poor woman's beginning to think she has alzheimer's. 
JULIE 
STRACK (CONT'D) not so much as one mini-mall ever went up in this city without some grease being laid into the palms downtown. You're not naive; you know it's a cost of doing business. Ordinarily you don't have to face it. Well, I face it, and a lot worse, into acynic--that's the easy way out, and I'm tougher than that. Strack gestures towards a table-top architectural model of the Riverfront Development. 
STRACK Take a look at that model, Julie. That was my father's dream. Now it's my dream. Acres of riverfront reclaimed from decay, thousands of jobs created, a building block--a very large building block--laid for the future. Not such a bad dream, as dreams go. And if the price of realizing that dream is the occasional distasteful chore, well... 
(BEAT) .the point is my father is well beyond the reach of the law, but that memo could embarrass Strack enterprises. 
JULIE All right, you're point is well taken. But the fact remains that I'm in possession of evidence of the commission of a crime. You can no more ask me to destroy it than I could ask you to destroy one of your buildings. 
STRACK Let me suggest this. You excuse yourself for a few minutes, go to the ladies' room, leaving your briefcase here. What happens to the memorandum while it's in my custody is my responsibility. 
CONTINUED 
67 CONTINUED(3) Julie smiles. 
JULIE I wish it were that simple. First of all, I don't have the memo with me. Even if I did-- 
STRACK It isn't safe to have that document. 
JULIE Are you threatening me? 
STRACK moves closer, touching her arm. 
STRACK I'm trying to protect you. Does. (He hesitates, pursing st her.) his lips, wondering if he can tru Does the name Robert Durant mean anything to you? 
JULIE He's an underworld figure-- racketeering, drugs. 
STRACK 
A And real-estate. Robert Durant is competitor for the river-front and knows about that document. He is a criminal, Julie. And he will freelyat resort to criminal methods to get he wants. There's a pause. 
JULIE 
AND Well, you're very eloquent, frankly I'm not certain what I should do. You'll have to trust me for a day or so to figure this out. 
CONTINUED

Darkman rushes to the service ladder and climbs quickly down into the warehouse. 
394 INT. WAREHOUSE 
A DOOR is kicked open as Smiley and Guzman enter, guns ps blazing, shooting the lab to hell. The gunfire sto and the lab is quiet. Guzman speaks quietly into a walkee-talkee. 
GUZMAN we're in. 
DURANT' S ., VOICE (from the walkee- 
TALKEE) He just went down from the roof. 
GUZMAN Glances above to the darkened rafters ofathence one to warehouse. Then, signals for Smiley way. He will go another. They split up. 
395 GUZMAN'S P.O.V. 395 The place is eerily still; we hear only an occasional computer beep. 
396 GUZMAN STARTS: 396 
GUZMAN ...Holy San Juan de fuckeen Capistrano! 
397 A DOZEN HUMAN FACES 397 hang on parallel clothes lines. Durant, Pauly, Skip, and Smiley. In the shadows, their eyeless heads are wrinkled and grotesquely life-like. 398 Guzman moves through the gallery of faces. A breeze 398 through the open window makes the clothes-line SQUEAK as the faces bob and nod to him. 399 He stops suddenly. His body shudders at the sight of... 399 
400 A FACE 400 his own. Hanging on a hook. 
401 GUZMAN 401 panics, backs into a rack of clothing, knocking it over. . he races past the wigs, the faces...running for his life... 
402 TWO SKELETAL HANDS 402 emerge from the darkness and latch around his throat! Guzman is yanked backward into the blackness without so much as a peep. 
403 SMILEY moves through the dimly lit lab area. Gun out, checking every crevice. 
404 Footsteps. Coming closer through the darkness. 
URANT'S VOICE D (from the walkee- 
TALKEE) Come in, Smiley, come in! Come-- 
CLICK. 
H417 
H417 THE PLASTIC BIRD it bobs up. and down. The same toy that destroyed Peyton's lab. Durant's lighter lies on a platform just under the beak of the drinking bird. It bobs closer and closer to the switch on the lighter, about to make contact.

417A SKIP 417A dives for it, snatching it... .the hand clenches empty air. The bird is a transparent holograph. Skip turns in horror. HIS POV--nearby is the real bird, bobbing in'synch with the holograph. 
EXTREME CLOSE SHOT - THE REAL BIRD'S BEAK dips closer to the electronic lighter's ignition button. Closer... closer... 
CUT TO: 
418 THE DARKMAN 418 gropes desperately at the floor of the helicopter for a handhold. His fingertips barely touch a rope ladder. 
419 DURANT 419 slides open the steel door and kicks viciously at his face, knocking him overboard. 
420 THE HELICOPTER 420 rising straight up as the Darkman tumbles backwards in free fall, back towards the roof.

425 INT. HELICOPTER 425 
The force of the explosion ROCKS the helicopter. The pilot loses control and the helicopter spins wildly in rapid 360s like the speeded up arms of a clock. 
B426 DARKMAN B426 is barely able to hold onto the ladder. Below him, P426 the tiny city is a spinning blur of metal and asphalt and P426 glass. 
427 PILOT 427 He pulls the stick. Gradually the helicopter rights itself. 
DURANT 
SHAKE HIM! 
428 THE HELICOPTER 428 banks sharply through the concrete canyons--a deadly game of crack the whip. 
429 SMASH! 
THE DEAN is hurled through the window of an office on the 70th floor of a skyscraper. 
430 INT. OFFICE 
The Darkman, still holding the rope, finds himself on solid ground. 
A BOARD MEETING The executives stare in shock at the Darkman standing on their table. 
DARKMAN'S POV The faces of the executives whirling in a circle like numbers on a roulette wheel. 
431 Suddenly, the faces start to recede... SMASH!... The Darkman is yanked back out the window, breaking the remaining glass. 
432 ON THE STREET BELOW pedestrians scurry from the rain of falling glass. Camera swishes up to reveal... 
433 THE HELICOPTER as it roars away from the skyscraper at an insane angle, the pilot having finally managed to regain some control. 
DURANT Dip him! 
434 THE HELICOPTER angles sharply toward a busy freeway. 
435 DARKMAN is dipped into oncoming traffic. He barely clears the roof of a Cadillac by swinging his legs above it. 
436 THE HELICOPTER swoops lower. 
THE DARICMAN' S LEGS dangle six feet above the ground, whizzing over the asphalt at 100 miles per hour. The legs part as they pass over a motorcycle, then close again. 
437 THE HELICOPTER swoops lower, slamming the Darkman to the pavement. He drags for a moment, a pack of motorcycles WHIZZING past his head. Like a marionette, he's jerked back up right in front of an oncoming 1973 Delta 88 Oldsmobile. He is grazed by the car's hood. His body bounces off the windshield. 
438 DARMAN is lifted straight into the path of a fast-moving truck. Truck HONKS furiously. Darkman strains his legs. CLOSE-UP: TRACKING over the truck's aluminum roof. 
CLANGITY CLANGITY CLANG 
THE DARXMAN'S FEET run 80 miles an hour along the roof of the truck. Darkman manages to loop the bottom rung of the rope ladder to a steel hook on the truck's cab.

STRACK ...I must say, Dr. Westlake, you've certainly worked some mischief. Pretty much wiped out the security arm of Strack Industries. That's okay. I'm a good sport... He leaps from beam to beam, Durant/Darkman following cautiously behind. 
STRACK ...And I can handle my own problems. I do whatever I have to do. In fact, that's how I got my first properties. My wife--late wife--held certain deeds... I sent her on a plane trip over the Smokies and well, let's just say ;landed on My feet... 
(SHRUGS) .as for my father, well, he was old, I spared him a few miserable years... Yes, we all have dreams, Dr. Westlake, but we don't all have what it takes to realize those dreams. 
DURANT/DARKMAN All I have are nightmares. A beat. 
STRACK Then share my dream. After all, you and I are pretty much the same. We should be working together. Both smart fellows. Similar styles. Same taste in women. I could use a man like you. 
DURANT/DART AN 
(RASPS) Go to hell. 
STRACK Eventually, eventually... He proceeds nimbly along the beam.

P446 CONTINUED(3) 
STRACK I guess you just don't have what it takes. I gather you run around wearing other people's faces now, since yours is so... loathsome. He shrugs. 
STRACK .See I could never do that. The world has to take me as I am. And all this tit-for- tat stuff you've been up to. Silly. Living in the past. ; only destroy to build something better, whereas You..â¢ ah, here we are. 
447 Julie stands out on the end of a projecting girder, at the furthest extremity of the growing building. Wind whips at her hair and dress; she clings pathetically to an upright. 
DURANT/DARKMAN Julie! Strack laughs. 
STRACK Bring on the strings! Young lovers! In peril! Separated by ruthless forces, larger than they!--What a banal tale. In it, I suppose I play the villain. But wait, Julie--which of us is the monster here?! With this he reaches over to Durant and--SQUISHHHRIPPP!! -- tears his face off, tossing it over the edge.. 
448 The face spins down, whooshing end over end, the wind flapping it this way and that. On the way down it slaps against the occasional girder, momentarily flattening out into the recognizable face of Durant, and then peels away again. It spins downward towards a forest of reinforcing bars that form a pungi pit of steel spikes in the open foundation below. Finally it lands--splat-- pierced through the eye by one of the rusty re-bars. 
449 JULIE gazes at Darkman's ghastly visage for the first time, overcome by horror and repulsion. Darkman's vein pulses like csa y.. Strack"s tone is almost admiring: 
STR.ACK You truly are one ugly son of a bitch. 
BLAM! Strack shoots Darkman in the shoulder, hurling him off the bean. The Darkman tumbles, limbs flailing, bellowing with rage. 
THE WORLD Spinning upside down--stars, abyss, stars, abyss-- 
GIRDER As Darkman's fingertips clamp onto the upper lip of an I-beam... barely hanging on, vein pulsing. 
ON THE UPPER GIRDER Strack looks down, wind whipping his hair. HIS POV-- nothing. Darkman has been swallowed up by the night. Pocketing his gun, Strack proceeds toward Julie. 
JULIE recoils as Strack stops in front of her. He touches her hair. 
STRACK 
(WITH REMORSE) First my wife, then my father, and now 
YOU-- He places his hands on her shoulders, preparing to push her off the girder. With intensity:

STRACK -It is the tragedy of my life that I always have to kill the ones I love. As he's about to push her: 
A VOICE BEHIND HIM IDuis ! Strack turns around. 
4 5 0 STRACK St. stands behind him, glaring angrily. 
STRACK JR. Father? 
STRACK SR. 
(HORRIBLE RASP) I should've snuffed you out at birth! With that Strack Sr. rips off his own face, exposing the enraged visage of Darkman... Strack reaches for his gun. 
451 BAM! Darkman mashes his face and the gun flies out of his hand into the darkness below. 
STRACK AND DARXMAN 
OF battle it out on the narrow girder, hundreds of feet sure death on either side of them. 
BAM! BAM! BAM! Savage punches send Strack reeling--BAM!--he falls onto the girder... nearby are a bunch of tools... Strack crawls toward them.

DARIOM swoops onto Strack, pummelling him. 
STRACR'S HAND inching painfully toward the rivet gun. 
DARKMAN pummelling, lost in the act of his final revenge. He steps back to give a final blow... .and slips on some loose rivets, flailing for balance. 
STRACK lunges. CLANG! Darkman slams into a vertical bar. 
ZMMMMMM! Z !

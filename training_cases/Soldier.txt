REVISED DRAFT October 2, 1997 
INT.  HOSPITAL NURSERY - NIGHT 
BABIES in bassinets, isolettes, incubators.  BABIES sleeping, BABIES blinking, BABIES cooing, BABIES chirping, BABIES squalling. 
It's the SQUALLING BABIES, the ones with pinched faces and tiny bunched fists, that seem to interest the TWO ANONYMOUS MEN in Military Uniforms.  (Their anonymity is assured by the angles from which they are seen; they are hands, they are feet, they are the backs of heads.) 
A lone NURSE watches them grimly as they make their "selections," marking the cribs of the most active, noisy BABIES with X's. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  VAN/HOSPITAL - NIGHT 
ANGLE ON VAN DOORS slamming shut on a dozen squalling BABIES in tiered red cribs. 
ANGLE ON THE VAN pulling away from the loading dock of the large hospital as a date is SUPERED over the scene... 
CUT TO: 
INT.  CAGE/BASEMENT ROOM - DAY OR NIGHT 
Vicious teeth, savage snarls, tearing flesh as three fierce fighting DOGS battle a single WOLVERINE in large steel cage. 
The cage is in the middle of a gloomy windowless room surrounded by twenty TWO-YEAR-OLDS seated on folding chairs and dressed in identical gray overalls.  As the TWO-YEAR-OLDS watch the battle, amazement on their innocent faces, a date appears SUPERED over the scene... 
WE DISCOVER in the shadows more ANONYMOUS MEN (and WOMEN), some of them in Military Uniforms, observing the children. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  A WINDOWLESS CEMENT ROOM - DAY OR NIGHT 
It's creepy:  the same children two years older, milling about a bare cement room, apparently unsupervised.  They ought to look cute, but somehow these joyless FOUR-YEAR-OLDS look slightly sinister, all of them wearing drab uniforms and military burr-cut hair.  Again a date is SUPERED over the scene -- 
-- just as an AGGRESSIVE FOUR-YEAR-OLD approaches a PASSIVE FOUR YEAR-OLD seated on the floor and kicks him. 
It's a harmless child's kick.  But then, as the DATE DISAPPEARS, he kicks the PASSIVE FOUR-YEAR-OLD again.  And again. 
The servo-motor in a remote video camera mounted high on the wall WHINES slightly as the camera pans to the record the action. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  WINDOWLESS "CLASSROOM" - DAY OR NIGHT 
Puzzles.  Fingers fit shapes into holes.  The puzzles aren't fun puzzles; they're obviously tests of intelligence or dexterity or both.  SIX-YEAR-OLDS now, the boys perform in a grim room under fluorescent lights as more ANONYMOUS MEN and WOMEN in polished shoes and sharply creased military slacks cruise the aisles, observing. 
As a date appears SUPERED over this scene... 
WE NOTICE one of the SIX-YEAR-OLDS is becoming familiar to us. TODD.  We NOTICE his intense eyes as he dexterously manipulates a puzzle. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  FIELD - DAY 
Behind a cyclone fence topped with curlicues of razor wire, the boys, now TEN-YEAR-OLDS, are marching in formation under the supervision of a (faceless) DRILL SERGEANT.  Again a date is SUPERED over the scene... 
CUT TO: 
INT.  GYMNASIUM - DAY 
Fourteen-year-old TODD is doing bench presses in shorts while all around him his FOURTEEN-YEAR-OLD COMRADES work out with weights in a very grim and spartan gym that resembles a sinister concentration camp more than the yuppie spas of the 20th Century. The date appears SUPERED over the scene... 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  OBSTACLE COURSE/MONTAGE - DAY 
The FOURTEEN-YEAR-OLDS, TODD among them, jump, roll, dive, crawl, swim, and rappel through a brutal course featuring: 
vertical wooden walls, 
fast moving rapids, 
tangles of barbed wire, 
steep rock faces, 
and finally a jungle of dangling chains with tiny circular "platforms" about eight inches in diameter every ten feet. FOURTEEN YEAR OLDS bloody each other with pugil sticks and padded cudgels while they swing twenty feet above the ground.  One of them is knocked off, plummets downward.  CRUNCH! 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  SNOW COVERED LANDSCAPE - DAY 
Long even strides, two inches of snow.  Breathing hard, the SIXTEEN-YEAR-OLDS now lope through hills and woods in shorts and T-shirts, their breath coming in steamy blasts as the date is SUPERED over the scene... 
This a brutal cross country run under a grim sky in bitter cold weather, but the SIXTEEN-YEAR-OLDS are super-fit, their faces hard and without expression, their eyes as cold as snake eyes. 
Except for the STRAGGLER, a lone boy who's bringing up the rear, obviously in trouble, gasping for air, struggling, struggling, struggling to keep his feet... 
ANGLE ON A HILL where ANONYMOUS OBSERVERS, all in military dress, watch. 
ANGLE ON THE STRAGGLER, unable to keep his feet, going down, gasping.  With fearful eyes, he looks toward the hill where he knows the OBSERVERS are. 
ANGLE ON THE PACK, sixteen SIXTEEN-YEAR-OLDS not looking back, even as a single SHOT rings out.  TODD doesn't even blink, just keeps running. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  SHOOTING RANGE - DAY 
Suddenly, out of nowhere, a scary mechanized pop-up target, a MILITARY FIGURE, erupts from the long grass, weapon pointing. Before the weapon can flash a laser bean, AUTOMATIC FIRE ravages the target and it disappears back into the grass.  The boys, EIGHTEEN-YEAR-OLDS now, are wearing combat gear and carrying automatic weapons as they advance through a sloping field of tall grass. 
Different sophisticated TARGETS pop up urgently, sometimes close, sometimes far, some MOVING rapidly on tracks. 
Suddenly a terrified MOTHER dashes along the street, a screaming BABY in her arms, looking for shelter. 
A CIVILIAN MAN pops out of a doorway, pulls her to safety. 
REVEAL TODD, watching from the shell of a once proud building. 
TODD'S POV of four ENEMY SOLDIERS running at a crouch among the rubble. 
ANGLE ON TODD watching them scurry into a cellar door.  TODD turns and gives a hand signal. 
ANGLE ON RILEY twenty yards away, hidden behind exposed machinery, acknowledging the signal and, along with a THIRD SOLDIER, advancing toward the cellar. 
EXT.  CELLAR DOOR 
TODD, RILEY, and the THIRD SOLDIER converge stealthily, coordinating with hand signals. 
TODD pulls the pin on a grenade, and RILEY and the THIRD SOLDIER kick in the door. 
TODD tosses the grenade in as RILEY fires a withering barrage of automatic fire through the cellar door. 
BAHWHOOM!  The grenade EXPLODES. 
Then, RILEY, TODD and the THIRD SOLDIER charge in. 
INT.  CELLAR 
HEAVY FIRE as TODD, RILEY and the THIRD SOLDIER spray the room. 
ANGLE ON TODD signaling cease fire. 
Sudden silence.  Drifting smoke.  Then...GROANS. 
Four ENEMY SOLDIERS are sprawled motionless, horribly eviscerated.  A fifth ENEMY SOLDIER, horribly wounded, is groaning. 
ANGLE ON TODD surveying the scene, stone faced. 
TODD'S POV of the enemy dead, and several CIVILIANS equally dead, as well as the dead BODIES of several CHILDREN. 
BANG!  RILEY shoots the groaning ENEMY SOLDIER. 
Silence again. 
CLOSE ON TODD, his stone face.  What does he see?  What does he feel?  Anything?  A mystery! 
CUT TO: 
INT.  BARRACKS - DAY 
A spartan room, bare bunk-beds.  Rain POUNDS on a window that looks out into a stormy sky over the godforsaken ruins of the Third Dresden Moon. 
TODD is sitting on a bunk, shirtless.  His new rank has been tattooed on his right cheek; there's a scar under one eye and another scar that distorts his lip slightly.  The names of various battles have been neatly stenciled down his left arm, an official record, not a decoration.  TODD is silent, staring into space.  The room is full of SOLDIERS in T-shirts, fatigues, sleepwear.  WORDS APPEAR SUPERED OVER THE SCENE... 
The WORDS FADE AWAY, the silence continues, the rain BEATS on the barracks, no one says a word, they just stare into space or watch the rain beat on the windowpane.  They look like robots...used robots, made individual only by their different scars. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  BARRACKS - DAY 
Rain.  Low buildings, boarded windows, slogans painted on the war- scarred walls, the makeshift barracks in one building, command quarters in the next. 
A lone figure, a MAN IN A PONCHO, hurries through the downpour, passing the barracks, heading for the command quarters. 
INT.  COMMAND QUARTERS 
Entering, the MAN shakes rain off his poncho.  His name is RUBRICK, he's thirty-five, a lieutenant.  He faces the two bored OFFICERS lounging in the cluttered office where outdated equipment is strung together by mazes of wire and the desktops are heaped with printout sheets and styrofoam coffee cups. 
The captain, CHURCH, has his feet on the desk.  He's fifty years old, gray and fat and soft.  The other officer, SLOAN, also a lieutenant, is a thirty-five year old woman, dark, moderately attractive, but not particularly happy. 
RUBRICK Colonel Mekum has his "boys" unpacked.  I think he wants to show them off. 
CHURCH Hmmmmph. 
RUBRICK They look...impressive. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  "STATION" - DAY 
A NEW SOLDIER fills the frame, a perfect-looking man/boy of about twenty built like a linebacker, powerful looking with sculpted unscarred musculature.  He looks straight ahead, unblinking, and so does the one next to him, and the next one.  Twenty of them are standing in line in one corner of an enormous space that was once a station of some sort.  They don't seem to respond to the chill or to the occasional drops of rain from the skylights leaking sixty feet above them. 
Wearing dripping ponchos, CHURCH, SLOAN, and RUBRICK are looking the robot-like monsters over like so much meat, while a bright- eyed blond colonel about thirty, named MEKUM, stands proudly by, glowing with satisfaction. 
The vast interior is so large that in spite of clusters of stacked crates, part of a dismantled spaceship, a rusty earthmover, numerous large pieces of machinery, and a whole arrangement of exercise gear, the place has huge open spaces and a sense of emptiness to it. 
SLOAN walks close to the line of NEW SOLDIERS and studies one, her eyes drifting over their muscular bodies.  She breaks the long silence. 
SLOAN Well, they're...pretty. 
CHURCH (to Mekum) What's so hot about them? 
MEKUM (proudly) Very much improved.  In every way. 
RUBRICK This is Colonel Mekum from Q.  He's their commanding officer. 
CHURCH (dubious) Improved...how? 
MEKUM As I said, in every way.  Physically and psychologically.  More endurance, quicker responses, better hand-eye, improved technical training.  Where the First Psychology gave you ninety-eight percent obedience, this bunch gives you 99.4. 
CHURCH (dubiously) Mmmmmm.  Weeell, you know my old daddy was in maintenance and he had a saying... 
RUBRICK and SLOAN exchange an eye-rolling private glance that means they've heard a lot of Daddy's sayings. 
CHURCH ...He used to say, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it." 
MEKUM (patronizing) I...see.  I'm not sure I quite get your...point... 
CHURCH (indicating the Veterans) Well, the soldiers we've got now, they've been through all kinds of heavy shit...and they've always got the job done.  Now these new ones, these "hot shots" of yours...what kind of action have they seen?  They are battle-tested, aren't they? 
CHURCH Our man has been out there fifteen minutes now.  Shouldn't you send one? 
MEKUM (smug grin, to Church) In a minute. (turning back to Sloan) Now, see this test?  This shows what they do under sleep deprivation conditions.  Forty-eight hours awake and they can... 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  TODD RUNNING/RUINS - DAY 
Rain slashes his face as TODD runs, his eyes staring vacantly into the blinding storm, his legs pumping evenly, his feet chopping through the thick mud in a wasteland of shelled apartment buildings where rat-like CREATURES scurry out of his way as we... 
CUT TO: 
INT.  "STATION" - DAY 
Separated by fifteen yards, the two groups of SOLDIERS, the NEW and the VETERAN, sit on the cold cement floor, staring vacantly into space as they await orders.  Occasionally a VETERAN will rub his chin, another will scratch his nose, but nobody says anything, and when their eyes accidentally meet, they look away deliberately, expressionless.  Nobody flinches when a big door opens and pale light streams in. 
MEKUM is standing there in a poncho. 
MEKUM Melton, Eight Five.  Forward. 
MELTON, one of the husky new soldiers, climbs to his feet and steps toward MEKUM, saluting. 
MELTON Eight Five, sir. 
MEKUM Ten miles, Melton, on the run. 
MELTON's face shows no expression as MEKUM continues. 
MEKUM (O.S.) You've got sixty minutes.  Go. 
MELTON Sir! 
MELTON heads out into the rain running smoothly and easily as we... 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  TODD/RUINS - DAY 
TODD's breath comes in even rasps as his feet splash over rough terrain, splash splash splash, hard work but nothing in his stone face indicates he's not equal to the task.  Splash splash splash! 
CUT TO: 
INT.  OFFICER QUARTERS - DAY 
In the cluttered office, RUBRICK, CHURCH, and SLOAN look up from a conversation as MEKUM enters dripping wet and takes off his poncho, smiling smugly. MEKUM My man left exactly twenty minutes after yours.  Make a note of that. 
RUBRICK What are we supposed to do with the old soldiers? 
MEKUM (a shrug and a grin) Old soldiers never die. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  TODD/RUINS - DAY 
Running.  Splash splash splash!  TODD makes a turn, heading back, his face like stone, as we... 
CUT TO: 
INT.  OFFICERS QUARTERS - DAY 
MEKUM is filling his coffee cup as he speaks. 
MEKUM They'll serve as a labor force.  You can use them for physical stuff... loading, unloading, repairs, power lines, that kind of thing. (a glance around the office) Even cleaning...sweeping...,uh, tidying up. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  TODD/RUINS - DAY 
Breathing steadily, raspily, TODD lopes through the rain. Something makes him glance back over his shoulder. 
Thirty yards back he sees a vague shape, obscured by rain. 
TODD looks ahead again, his face revealing nothing, his legs maintaining the same even pace, running, running, running. 
Then he looks back again. 
The vague shape is taking form, a GHOSTLY RUNNER getting closer. 
TODD continues at the same even place.  He doesn't look back again until he feels closeness.  Then he looks. 
IT'S MELTON only a few yards behind him, running effortlessly, keeping a steady pace that's faster than TODD's.  The bigger man moves even with TODD without even looking at him, as though TODD weren't there, and then he moves ahead like a big machine, inexorable. 
As TODD runs, eyes straight ahead, he can see MELTON becoming ghostly, disappearing in the curtains of rain ahead as we... 
CUT TO: 
INT.  "STATION" - DAY 
The huge doors are open to the rain as SLOAN, CHURCH, RUBRICK, and MEKUM watch for signs of TODD.  Still dripping vet, the muscular MELTON is standing beside MEKUM, breathing heavily but not desperately. 
MEKUM Of course, age is a factor, but the real factor is the training program, especially the psychological.  The mind controls the body after all, and we're doing wonderful things with the mind. 
A shape appears in the rain a hundred yards off, moves closer, takes the form of a runner running.  It's TODD, still moving at the same pace, his face like stone. 
TODD lopes into the big warehouse and, breathing hard but evenly, comes to a halt in front of RUBRICK and salutes. 
TODD Sir. 
RUBRICK At ease, soldier. 
CHURCH has been thinking and now he speaks to MEKUM. 
CHURCH What's the price of all that speed? Is he tired? MEKUM Tired? 
CHURCH Todd here ran the pace he's been taught to run.  He's still strong. Send him up the chain, Rube. 
RUBRICK (to Todd) Soldier!  Up the chain! TODD Sir. 
MELTON gurgles while GOINES hits him in the face. 
ANGLE ON MEKUM WATCHING BELOW.  For the first time a frown of concern wrinkles his brow. 
ANGLE ON MELTON AND TODD on chains just below the girders. MELTON slams an elbow back into TODD's ribs hard and TODD gasps for air, but... 
GOINES uses the moment to slam a knee into MELTON's balls and... 
MELTON gasps, then grabs GOINES by the neck with one hand, rips him from the chain, and sends him plunging violently downward even as... 
TODD goes for face with his free hand. 
SLAM!  MELTON smashes TODD in the ribs with an elbow. 
TODD savagely gouges out one of MELTON's eyes. 
ANGLE ON MEKUM, sixty feet below, enraged at the sight of MELTON's injury. 
ANGLE ON THE VETERANS watching the brutal fight with blank impassive faces, RILEY among them. 
ANGLE ON THE NEW SOLDIERS watching, robot-like. 
ANGLE ON THE STRUGGLE OVERHEAD.  SMASH!  SMASH!  SMASH!  MELTON's elbows drive back into TODD's ribs.  The breath knocked out of him, TODD gasps for air, pain contorting his face. 
MELTON manages to get TODD's forearm into his mouth and bites furiously, drawing blood. 
TODD grits his teeth in pain. 
WHAM!  Another blow to the ribs from MELTON's elbow. 
TODD is losing his grip. 
RILEY watches below, his face a mask. 
MELTON bites and elbows furiously. 
TODD loses his grip and grabs at MELTON, rakes flesh as he begins to fall and then... 
Plunging downward, TODD grabs wildly at the chain and catches it ...but he keeps falling, the chain ripping flesh from his hand for twenty feet until... 
He can't hold on any longer!  TODD plunges the last thirty feet to the floor, landing with a terrible crunch right on top of ROMERO's broken body below. 
Sudden silence! 
ANGLE ON THE VETERANS watching impassively as TODD lies motionless, sprawled on ROMERO's body. 
ANGLE ON THE NEW SOLDIERS revealing no feelings. 
ANGLE ON CHURCH, SLOAN, and RUBRICK looking stunned and shaken. 
It's MEKUM who breaks the silence, SCREAMING furiously at the one- eyed MELTON who's still sixty feet up... MEKUM GET DOWN HERE!  GET DOWN HERE ON THE DOUBLE, GET YOUR ASS DOWN HERE, YOU MISERABLE PISS ANT STINKING SHIT FOR BRAINS! 
CHURCH, SLOAN, and RUBRICK lift their stunned faces from TODD to MEKUM who's continuing to rant at MELTON as MELTON comes down the chain fast... MELTON COME ON, DOUBLE IT UP, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, YOU MISERABLE THIRD RATE SHITHEAD INCOMPETENT CLOWN! 
MELTON lets go of the chain and drops the last fifteen feet, landing gracefully on his feet in front of MEKUM and salutes. 
MELTON Sir! 
MEKUM LOOK AT YOU, YOU BIG DUMB SHIT, YOU'VE LOST AN EYE.  WHAT THE HELL GOOD IS A GODDAMN ONE-EYED SOLDIER? DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT COST TO BREED YOU, YOU BIG MORON?  TO TRAIN YOU, FEED YOU? 
As MEKUM turns, including all the NEW SOLDIERS in his continuing tirade, CHURCH, SLOAN, and RUBRICK confer in low voices. 
RUBRICK They're...fantastic! 
CHURCH (reluctant agreement) Mmmmmmm... 
SLOAN (worried) We could have a problem here, couldn't we?  I mean, we just lost three men... 
CHURCH Oh, I wouldn't worry about that. "Training accident."  Paperwork. 
SLOAN What about the bodies? 
CHURCH (turning away) Incinerator. 
Turning his back on SLOAN and RUBRICK, CHURCH approaches MEKUM who's still raging, indicating MELTON to the blank-faced NEW SOLDIERS. 
MEKUM WHAT GOOD IS THIS MAN NOW?  WITH ONE GOOD EYE!  HE'S GOT NO DEPTH PERCEPTION! HE'S CANNON FODDER.  ALL HE CAN DO IS WALK POINT AND TAKE THE FIRST HIT. 
CHURCH (interrupting) They're very...impressive. 
MEKUM (fuming) Yeah, well, the big moron shouldn't have lost an eye. 
CHURCH glances at TODD's corpse dumped over ROMERO's broken body, tries to assuage him. 
CHURCH It was our best man who got his eye...  Todd, a real tough one. Survived police action in Montana, fought in the Argentine Sector, and in the Saudi Campaign to say nothing of -- MEKUM Old news!  They're nothing at all! Wait until you get these new fellas into some real action.  I guarantee you'll be awed.  I guarantee it. 
The NEW SOLDIERS sit impassively, the bleeding MELTON among them, staring right at the VETERANS. 
Not far away three dead bodies lie motionless as we... 
CUT TO: 
INT.  FURNACES/FURNACE ROOM - NIGHT 
A rage of flame!  The mouth of a huge furnace leers with yellow fury, eight feet high. 
Two men, BURNERS, in asbestos fire suits and helmets, appear, laboriously dragging a tattered sofa leaking stuffing.  With effort they shove it into the blazing furnace where it is quickly consumed.  Slowly the BURNERS turn and trudge back for another load as we REVEAL A REFUSE BIN, seven feet high, looming in the shadows not far from the flickering light of the furnace.  It's overflowing with junk, barely distinguishable in the gloom. 
The BURNERS grab blindly and haul out the next object. 
It's ROMERO's dead body.  They haul it out of the bin and let it flop limply to the floor where ROMERO stares sightlessly at nothing. 
The BURNERS stare at the body, exchange a blank look through their visors, shrug and start to drag the heavy carcass toward the flames. 
INT.  REFUSE BIN/FURNACE ROOM/CLOSE BY 
In the near darkness, the faintest flickering light reveals two tangled BODIES, motionless in the confusion of refuse.  But not quite motionless!  A hand opens and closes!  A bloody hand! Fingers twitch. 
MACE is looking around.  He spots the open door to the bedroom, hurries to it, and disappears. 
SANDRA starts after him, looking worried...but before she gets to the door, MACE reappears with NATHAN safely in his arms. 
MACE If there's any danger to Nathan -- 
SANDRA (interrupting grimly) I won't permit danger to Nathan. 
MACE and SANDRA lock eyes in firm understanding as we... 
CUT TO: 
INT.  WAR SHIP - "DAY" 
EXPLOSION!  SCREAMS!  SMOKE!  A SIREN!  We're in some kind of war ship in outer space during a battle. 
The interior is a lot like the interior of a submarine, cramped even in the best conditions and right now the conditions are awful as SOLDIERS in bulky space suits stumble through thick smoke while a SIREN WHOOPS urgently and wounded SOLDIERS scream in agony. 
WHOOOOM!  Another EXPLOSION!  SCREAMING METAL! 
Part of the bulkhead is shot away and the suction is like wind, ripping SOLDIERS out of the hole into space.. 
We FOCUS ON a soldier in a space suit who's wedged himself behind a cannon.  As we look closely at his visor, we recognize TODD who's firing back at the enemy while all around him SOLDIERS are screaming and dying as we... 
CUT TO: 
INT.  BEDROOM - MORNING 
SUDDEN SILENCE!  TODD blinks awake.  He looks around. 
It's the same bedroom, but morning light is streaming in the high window. 
He can hear SOUNDS...LAUGHTER...coming from beyond the door. 
INT.  OTHER ROOM 
NATHAN is wobbling forward with wide eyes as MACE holds one of his hands and SANDRA holds the other.  They're teaching the child to walk, encouraging each step.  But when they let go, NATHAN totters forward only one step before landing flat on his ass. MACE and SANDRA laugh, making the whole thing a game, and NATHAN, after a moment of confusion, joins in the laughter.  It's a warm moment until SANDRA, sensing a presence, turns toward the bedroom, suddenly serious. 
MACE follows her look. 
TODD is standing in the doorway, supporting himself on the door frame...his soldier's eyes full of unspoken menace... one leg heavily bandaged. 
SANDRA (nervous) You must be...you must be feeling better. 
TODD says nothing.  His eyes flick to NATHAN. 
MACE is watching TODD sharply. 
MACE We're teaching the boy to walk. 
SANDRA (nervously filling silence) He's late learning.  He was sick for a long time. 
TODD says nothing.  His eyes follow MACE who's gone to the corner where he's seizing a heavy metal rod that might be a weapon. 
TODD tenses.  Ready.  Dangerous. 
As MACE turns toward him, MACE doesn't notice the danger in TODD'S eyes. 
MACE I got something for you. 
He innocently approaches with the metal rod. 
Super alert, TODD watches MACE hold the rod out to him. 
MACE Here. 
TODD looks mistrustful. 
MACE Like this. 
MACE demonstrates, using the rod like a cane. MACE See? 
Expressionless, watches MACE use the cane. 
MACE Practice with it.  In a day or two maybe you'll be strong enough to go out to the garden with Sandra. 
MACE never even realizes how much danger he was in. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  OTHER ROOM - DAY - A LITTLE LATER 
TODD's heavy boots come close to NATHAN, the cane clumps down, just missing him. 
NATHAN looks up with open-mouthed innocence and childlike wonder at TODD who looms past him, walking very cautiously with the help of a cane. 
TODD looks down at NATHAN.  Their eyes meet for a moment.  TODD is wearing one of the heavy parkas the pioneers wear. 
SANDRA answers a KNOCK at the door, opens it, revealing ELLEN, the ten-year-old, in the doorway.  Behind her are JOHNNY and WILL, as well as several other CHILDREN of various ages. 
ELLEN I came for Nathan. 
But ELLEN's eyes are on TODD and so are the others crowding behind her to peep over her shoulder.  They all want to get a look at TODD, but when he looks in their direction, they retreat shyly. 
SANDRA is wearing a parka too.  She picks up NATHAN from where he's sitting near TODD's feet and carries him to the door, giving him a kiss, then handing him to ELLEN. 
NATHAN starts to cry and holds his arms out to his mother as ELLEN hugs him and comforts him. 
TODD watches the drama as ELLEN and SANDRA comfort the child and soothe his fears at being separated from his mother. 
Nothing shows in TODD's eyes...but affection seems to fascinate him. 
As ELLEN and her cohorts hurry off with NATHAN, they sneak over- the-shoulder glances at the strange monster, TODD. 
Just then MACE, dressed in a heavy parka also, comes out of the bedroom and heads for the door. 
MACE Let's go.  Come on, Sergeant. 
SLADE It's not an unreasonable question. (to Todd) How about it, Sergeant? 
ON TODD, actually struggling with the question... remembering.  Suddenly he blurts... 
TODD I was...replaced. 
MACE Replaced? 
TODD hesitates for half a second before answering. 
TODD By a better soldier, sir. 
There are looks exchanged among the PIONEERS as we... 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  GARDEN - DAY 
A little seedling is fitted into the earth gently.  TODD's strong hands pat the earth around it. 
TODD reaches for another seedling.  He's one of a group of ten PIONEERS, all on their hands and knees, all working intently, silently.  They seem to have accepted him.  Nobody stares. 
TODD is carefully patting the next seedling in the ground when something causes him to look up. 
Five ENEMY SOLDIERS in torn and dirty uniforms are looming over him, weapons pointed at him.  All around them is a desert of sand stretching forever under a baking sun. 
One of the soldiers kicks TODD. 
ANGLE ON EMMA, JUDITH, and several other PIONEER WOMEN exchanging nervous glances as they look back to where TODD's kneeling. 
There are no soldiers...but somehow, he's trampled several rows of seedlings. 
TODD looks toward them, confused, disoriented by his "memory." 
The women look away quickly, frightened, and we... 
CUT TO: 
INT.  OTHER ROOM - NIGHT 
SANDRA is changing NATHAN's diaper as she chatters, her back to TODD. 
SANDRA ...And it got worse and worse.  My father hadn't had any work in three months and...also...there were other things...violence...  political feelings.  My father said he'd heard it was better in the Trinity moons. A lot of other people must have had the same idea because the ship was jammed with people...mostly families.  That's probably why it broke down...  overloaded. 
Across the room, TODD, wearing a T-shirt and baggy pants is sitting on a stool, his face impassive as ever. 
As SANDRA talks, her back to him, TODD's eyes are on the contours of her body against the shift she's wearing.  It's very...erotic. 
SANDRA Even after they made the repairs, it barely got off the ground, it was an old converted mining transport, a piece of junk to start with.  It just...dropped.  Maybe you saw what's left of it...out there in the wind.  A lot of people died.  And we couldn't make any radio contact... So we were stuck here.  Nobody was happy about it.  A few years later, when the dumpers started coming over and dropping stuff, people tried to get their attention with explosions and fires.  But it didn't work. They must be unmanned...or they just don't care.  Maybe they think we're garbage too! 
TODD'S face is as impassive as ever while his eyes caress the shape of her body...and she, unaware, continues to reminisce. 
SANDRA So there really wasn't any choice. People had to pull together and make the best of it.  We became a... community. 
As SANDRA maneuvers NATHAN, TODD catches glimpses of her breasts pushing against the material of the shift.  She continues, still not noticing where his attention is. 
SANDRA One good thing...nobody bothers us. Who'd want to fight over a godforsaken place like this? 
A wry laugh.  She turns to put NATHAN down on the floor and catches TODD's eyes just as he shifts them quickly from her breasts. 
For a moment it's awkward...she looks at him...then she recovers. 
SANDRA I guess that's what you like!  The fighting, I mean.  The wars. (unsure, a question really) You must...you're a soldier... 
TODD doesn't answer as we... 
CUT TO: 
INT.  CORRIDOR (AND MEETING ROOM) - DAY 
The CHILDREN are peeking around a doorway, watching something in the meeting room. 
HAWKINS, coming along the dirt-walled corridor, spots the CHILDREN ahead. 
HAWKINS You children are supposed to be doing lessons. 
The CHILDREN barely acknowledge her as she comes even with them. She looks at what they're looking at. 
What they're seeing through the doorway is TODD, shirtless, doing an eerie sequence of tai chi exercises.  His muscular body ripples, revealing an incredible map of scar tissue that speaks eloquently of the life he's led...gash marks, long zippers of stitches, the puckered patches of burns. 
HAWKINS watches for a long moment, her eyes worried. 
In the midst of a slow graceful movement, TODD suddenly whirls and delivers a lightning blow to an unseen enemy with amazing speed and fury, the terrible force contained in the movement all too obvious. 
Even as HAWKINS and the CHILDREN gasp silently, TODD returns to the graceful, almost balletic movement, even spookier now, that preceded the deadly thrust. 
The CHILDREN's eyes are like saucers, their jaws agape. 
HAWKINS shudders...and breaks the hypnotic spell, speaking aloud to the children. 
HAWKINS Lessons.

EXT.  INSIDE TRENCH - NIGHT 
It's dark, the wind's HOWLING just above the trench walls as TODD peers into a faintly lighted window in the wall of the trench. 
TODD'S POV THROUGH THE BEDROOM WINDOW reveals a tender moment between MACE and SANDRA as they enter the bedroom and kiss.  A flickering candle on a low table, the only light, exaggerates their shadows. 
ANGLE ON TODD, his face revealing no feelings as he turns away. 
Light spills from other windows, some more brightly lit, as TODD begins to jog along the trench, gradually picking up speed, until he's running hard through intermittent pools of light in the maze of dark trenches. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  BARREN WASTE - DAY 
ANGLE ON SLADE looking sour.  Trouble!  Just what he expected. 
ANGLE ON MACE, taking a deep breath, smiling as he moves toward TODD, holding out his free hand for the rifle... 
MACE Uh, thanks, Sergeant.  Thanks a lot... 
But MACE breaks off, realizing that TODD'S attention is elsewhere. 
TODD is beyond MACE toward the landscape. 
MACE (and the other PIONEERS) turn to see what TODD'S looking at. 
ANGLE ON THE "JUNK MOUNTAINS" in the distance, several miles off, where, hovering high above the junk mountains, an ancient DUMPER SHIP issues a steady stream of metal and concrete debris onto the junk heaps far below.  The faint THUNDER of the refuse tumbling onto the steep slopes is just audible over the SOUND of the wind. 
CLOSE ON TODD, as realizes how he got here. 
ANGLE ON MACE, reacting to TODD'S intense interest. 
MACE Dumpers.  They come every twenty or thirty days. 
As TODD turns and looks at MACE, MACE puts out his hand again for the gun. 
TODD seems to notice the weapon in his hand for the first time. Unhesitatingly, he hands the rifle to MACE... 
As MACE casually takes the weapon, the PIONEERS breathe a sigh of relief, grinning again as the tension eases. 
TODD has turned his gaze back to the DUMPER SHIP, fascinated.  So that's what they did to him! 
Just then, JIMMY PIG claps TODD heartily on the shoulder. 
JIMMY PIG Thanks, partner.  These no-goods woulda just let me blow away. 
TODD, reacting to the smack on his shoulder, looks at JIMMY PIG like what was that?  Are you hitting me? 
But all the PIONEERS are gathering around TODD in such a jovial manner that the puzzled soldier sort of understands this isn't an attack.

INT.  OFFICE (OTHER WORLD) - NIGHT 
A CHRISTMAS TREE!  The corny little tree with plastic needles, blinking lights, and topped with a super cute angel is only a foot high.  It's sitting on CHURCH's cluttered desk next to framed photographs of CHURCH's wife and children.  We can hear MEKUM's voice badly transmitted... 
MEKUM (V.O.) Sorry to disturb the tranquillity of outer space on Christmas Eve, but I'm off to the Caribbean in a few hours, and I wanted to make sure you'd got the transmission on the security sweep. 
Glowering at the monitor where MEKUM's badly transmitted VIDEO IMAGE is quivering and distorting, CHURCH waves the print-out map he's holding in his hand, a map showing hundreds of little dots against a vast field, stars and moons in the vast sea of space. RUBRICK and SLOAN watch as CHURCH addresses MEKUM's image indignantly. 
CHURCH We got it all right.  This is an outpost here, not the Third Army! You've got us securing thirty-four locations and erecting monitor units in one month and -- 
MEKUM (interrupting) Piece of cake, guys!  These are totally remote, totally uninhabited territories.  All you do is set down, send out a patrol purely as a formality, then have those veterans of yours put up an A-Type unmanned monitoring unit.  You should be on about number twenty-five by the time I get back from my vacation... 
CHURCH What if we do run into people... say squatters or refugees? 
MEKUM (a frown) Well, you sure as hell don't want to get involved in evacuating people and that sort of thing. (then, meaningfully) My advice would be to..."avoid paperwork." 
CHURCH Eliminate them, you mean. MEKUM Well, no one's out there, but officially these are "hostile zones."  Therefore you'd be within your rights to classify anyone as "hostile," I think. But I repeat, you should be worried about boredom, not action.  Any other questions before I go? 
CHURCH hesitates.  SLOAN and RUBRICK look at him.  Then CHURCH blurts a question, his voice breaking... 
CHURCH Down there...is it snowing? 
MEKUM (a smirk) Not in the Caribbean.  Have a good Christmas, guys.  See you when I get back. 
MEKUM'S IMAGE disappears and the video screen goes blank, leaving a glum silence broken only by the DRUMMING of the rain on the roof. 
CHURCH moodily strolls toward his desk, and his eyes go to the photographs. 
His wife and children smile back at him from the pictures. 
Just then SLOAN taps him, and be turns to see her handing him a cup full of amber liquid. 
SLOAN Merry Christmas, Captain. 
RUBRICK is pouring another glass from a bottle of Scotch as the little tree winks on and off, and we... 
CUT TO: 
INT.  BARRACKS - NIGHT 
Silence.  Darkness.  Dim shapes in the darkness, hard to distinguish. 
Rain BEATS on the roof monotonously, relentlessly. 
The room is alive with BREATHING. 
Then we hear a MUFFLED WHOOP from outside. 
The darkness is tense, the BREATHING changes rhythm. 
The RATTLE of the door breaks the quiet. 
The door swings open, a flashlight stabs the dark. 
A woman GIGGLES:  SLOAN! 
The flashlight beams and wavers in the darkness, catching brief glimpses of the faces of the NEW SOLDIERS.  Their eyes glitter in the lurching beam, their faces are ghostly like vampires. 
RUBRICK switches on a dim overhead lamp as he and SLOAN (holding the flashlight) and CHURCH stagger drunkenly into the bunkhouse, carrying a couple of half-empty bottles. 
SLOAN Hi, fellas.  At ease! 
RUBRICK Merry Christmas, everybody. 
Eyes riveted on the THREE OFFICERS, the NEW SOLDIERS are unresponsive to Christmas cheer.  In fact, they look almost angry, like big dangerous animals, as the three OFFICERS stagger stupidly down the row of bunks, every eye following them. 
CHURCH We brought you a little Christmas tree. 
CHURCH almost falls over as he places the tree on the floor 
MACE Maybe he is.  It doesn't matter. 
MACE is staring grimly at the ceiling as we...

INT.  WINDOWLESS CEMENT ROOM - DAY OR NIGHT (FLASHBACK) 
Silent and surreal, the events of 1986 continue with the PASSIVE FOUR-YEAR-OLD sitting on the floor while the AGGRESSIVE FOUR-YEAR- OLD looks down at him, and other FOUR-YEAR-OLDS gather ominously. 
It's only now, as he gets to his feet, suddenly trading vicious blows with the AGGRESSIVE FOUR-YEAR-OLD that we realize that this passive boy is FOUR-YEAR-OLD TODD.  The boys don't fight like children; they don't quit or cry as the blood flows. 
Highly-polished shoes, sharply creased trousers, and eyes glittering from the shadows are all that is visible of the faceless OBSERVERS who make no move to interrupt the violence. 
FOUR-YEAR-OLD TODD, his nose pouring blood, exchanges savage hurtful blows with his opponent, bloodying him viciously, as we... 
CUT TO: 
INT.  OTHER ROOM - DAY (PRESENT) 
Eyes!  The adult TODD blinks away the memory, stares straight ahead... 
into NATHAN'S face, only six inches from his own. 
They're all alone in the room.  It's very quiet. 
NATHAN smiles a tentative smile, raises a hand, reaches out to touch TODD'S face affectionately, curiously, testing their friendship... ANGLE ON TODD, his eyes.  Dangerous.  He draws his face back enough to avoid being touched. 
NATHAN looks unsure.  He's used to affection.  Then he realizes... it must be a game!  He reaches out again... 
Again TODD avoids the touch...and as he does so, something catches his eye. 
TODD sees a VIPER sliding across the floor toward NATHAN. 
NATHAN doesn't see it; he's still trying to figure out this game. 
TODD pulls off his boot and hands it to NATHAN. 
NATHAN accepts it, thinks it's a gift.  He's pleased.  It's that kind of game!  He gives TODD a friendly "thanks for the boot" smile. 
TODD points to the VIPER which is close to NATHAN now. 
NATHAN looks at the VIPER.  He doesn't understand what he's supposed to do. 
TODD makes a hitting motion with his hand. 
The VIPER is close to NATHAN, coiling. 
NATHAN looks from the VIPER to TODD. 
TODD indicates the VIPER with his eyes.  His look is intense, a message in his eyes. 
The VIPER is like a spring, it strikes... 
TODD's hand is like a blur, almost invisible as he catches the snake and flips it a couple of feet. 
NATHAN stares. 
The angry VIPER SPITS and HISSES and coils to strike again. 
NATHAN looks at TODD. 
TODD eyes the boot, then indicates the VIPER with his eyes. 
NATHAN frowns; he's getting the idea. 
The VIPER is about to strike again... 
SQUASH!  A heavy boot comes down on the snake, crushing it. 
TODD looks up to see MACE standing on the snake, reaching down for NATHAN.  As MACE hugs the boy protectively to his chest, he glares down at TODD with eyes blazing with fury. 
TODD meets the look without blinking.  He never blinks. 
SANDRA (O.S.) What happened? 
TODD turns to see SANDRA standing in the bedroom door, her eyes almost as hard as TODD's as we... 
CUT TO: 
INT.  MEETING ROOM - NIGHT 
TODD stares impassively as HAWKINS addresses him... 
HAWKINS No one here has any animosity toward you, Sergeant.  None of us here is your enemy. 
TODD is standing in front of the room full of grim-faced PIONEERS, all looking at him.  It's like a court. 
HAWKINS is flanked by MACE and SANDRA... 
HAWKINS Moreover, we respect your qualities. We have no doubt that you are a very, very good soldier. 
As she speaks, TODD's blank stare considers the weathered faces of the PIONEERS facing him.  He sees CHESTER, EVA, RED with his WIFE, JIMMY PIG and his WIFE, SLADE and MRS. SLADE, JUDITH, EMMA, SALLY.  As HAWKINS continues, TODD's sharp eyes pick out details. He sees JIMMY PIG opening and closing his hands nervously, he sees SLADE fingering a barely noticeable rifle barrel.  CHESTER has a weapon too. 
HAWKINS (O.S.) But, because of your training, I don't think you'll ever be able to function in a group like this, a community of vulnerable people, of families, of children, where the ability to fight is not the sole purpose of existence. 
The PIONEERS are nervous, ready for trouble, afraid TODD might take this badly and fly off the handle. 
As TODD's huge hand opens...and closes, their eyes are on it.  He could pick up the table and hurl it at them, break men in half with his bare hands.  His face is like stone, his eyes like diamond chips as he glances toward SANDRA. 
TODD sees SANDRA is moved, trying to suppress her emotions, biting her lip, as HAWKINS goes on... 
HAWKINS You're different from us, Sergeant. We don't hate you for that, but we have agreed that to try to include you would pose an intolerable risk to the community itself. 
MACE We'll give you any tools you need, warm clothing, a good knife, boots. 
SANDRA (emotionally) And if you're ever sick...or you get hurt... 
RUBRICK (reading, not interested) Yeah?  What flavor pain in the ass? Gravity pain in the ass?  Atmosphere pain in the ass? 
CHURCH How about a "gaseous currents" and "urgent convections" pain in the ass. 
SLOAN I think you're trying to say a "wind pain in the ass." 
RUBRICK Wind! 
CUT TO: 
INT.  PIPE - DAY 
WIND!  As the wind RAGES outside, TODD, wearing his parka, crouches over a tiny fire inside a huge open-ended pipe twelve feet in diameter.  He stares at the bleak, windy landscape outside his shelter.  He looks primitive, like a caveman, and very very alone as we... 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  PIPE - DUSK 
The fat section of pipe is twenty feet long squatting in the blowing litter on the grim landscape in the shadow of the junk mountains.  Somehow that inanimate pipe also looks lonely in the vastness as the four suns overhead darken toward evening.

EXT.  STARS - NIGHT 
Stars glitter behind the dimmed suns as the wind HOWLS and we... 
CUT TO: 
INT.  PIPE - DAY 
The fire is nothing but coals.  TODD sits stoically over the embers, more alone than ever, chewing on a piece of dried food, part of his spartan meal. 
As he chews, he stares blankly at nothing until... 
A single tear crawls down one cheek. 
Then another. 
TODD looks like a stone statue oozing tears.  He reaches up and touches the strange water with his finger, then studies the finger, as though a tear were the most remarkable thing he's ever seen.  He cannot remember anything like this; he cannot remember ever having cried. 
And suddenly, without warning, he's convulsed with tears, heaving with sobs, alone in the big pipe with the pitiful little fire, bawling like a baby as we... 
CUT TO: 
INT.  BEDROOM - DAY 
A VIPER writhes across the floor through the patterns of light streaming through the window, a sinister presence, full of menace and evil designs. 
The VIPER winds its way toward an object that will prove in a moment to be a corner of the bad. 
SMACK!  The VIPER doesn't make it!  SMACK!  Another blow from MACE's heavy boot being swung by hand. 
The VIPER coils and HISSES angrily, wounded and dangerous. 
SMACK!  The boot again! 
NATHAN wields it awkwardly, hitting bravely at the HISSING VIPER! 
SMACK!  NATHAN hits again and... 
MACE rolls over in the bed. 
SMACK!  MACE comes awake, looks around. 
MACE lunges from the bed. 
SMACK!  Just as NATHAN gives the damaged VIPER another blow, MACE snatches the boy in his arms and yanks him away. 
SANDRA sits up in bad, looking around, alarmed. 
MACE is holding NATHAN, staring down at the VIPER. 
The VIPER has up the ghost, lying on the floor. 
MACE hugs NATHAN to him and looks toward SANDRA.  They both look at the boot.  And at the dead VIPER. 
Their eyes meet and, for a long moment, they just look at each other. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  OTHER ROOM - DAY - A LITTLE LATER 
MACE is wearing his parka, pulling on his eye protectors hurriedly as he opens the door to the corridor.  SANDRA's voice makes him stop and turn to her. 
SANDRA Mace!  What about the vote? Everybody voted. 
Mace glares at her for a moment, knowing she's right.  Then he turns away and starts out defiantly. 
MACE We voted wrong! 
SANDRA looks relieved and worried at the same time and we...

INT.  COCKPIT - DAY 
The driver is the beady-eyed giant, CAINE 607.  Reacting to what he see, he adjusts the vehicle to the right. 
EXT.  CRAWLER/LANDSCAPE 
Two ominous NEW SOLDIERS wearing plexi-goggles and bulky armor under their uniforms hang on the outside of the CRAWLER in the wind, their waists dangling with weapons and equipment, big rocket rifles across their chests.  They're looking ahead toward the long cable, as their nasty-looking vehicle grinds slowly forward through the litter, an evil vision. 
EXT.  LANDSCAPE 
TODD and MACE are running, TODD in the lead, buffeted by wind, struggling through a clutter of old machinery, diesel engines, turbines, scattered haphazardly on the flat desert floor. 
MACE is running too, not as well, and TODD has to reach back and grab him, pull him along... 
MACE (gasp) ...maybe...they're... (gasp) ...friendly... 
INT.  CRAWLER 
The GUNNER works a servomotor, aiming a cannon, as he peers through a scope. 
Through the scope, surrounded by digital readouts, we see two tiny running FIGURES... 
EXT.  CRAWLER 
BALAAM!  BALAAM!  The CRAWLER cannon FIRES... 
EXT.  LANDSCAPE 
MACE screams, he's hurled wildly mid-stride, tossed ten yards. 
TODD looks back, sees him lying on the sand, screaming in pain. 
TODD turns back, sprinting, low, weaving, tossed by the wind. 
WHOOOM!  Another SHOT.  If the wind hadn't hit him, TODD would have been hit. 
MACE is screaming.  His right leg is gone. 
TODD gets him, drags him, stumbles. 
WHOOM!  Another SHOT, another miss. 
TODD struggles for cover, staggering in the wind with MACE on his back. 
INT.  CRAWLER 
Through his scope, the GUNNER sees TODD and MACE dive behind a big turbine. 
Unhurriedly the GUNNER flicks a switch on the dash. 
CAINE 607 nods approval. 
The GUNNER works the servo, bringing the cannon to bear on the turbine. 
EXT.  TURBINES 
TODD is dragging MACE along behind the cover of the turbine, glancing back for what he knows will occur. 
BAWHOOM!  The area where they disappeared EXPLODES, chunks of steel fly. 
TODD keeps pulling MACE, who looks half dead as... 
BAWHOOM!  The TURBINE is hit again! 
INT.  CRAWLER 
Through the scope, the GUNNER aims again and watches another chunk of turbine disintegrate. 
The GUNNER glances at the robot-faced driver.  Their eyes meet. CAINE 607 nods.  Obviously, they've killed the two men. 
The GUNNER points to the cable. 
CAINE 607 follows the look, nods, and alters the course of the vehicle in toward the cable as he reaches for the radio mike. 
EXT.  ABANDONED ENGINES/TERRAIN 
TODD is crouched over MACE inside an abandoned diesel engine not far from the disintegrated turbine.  He's making a tourniquet to stop the bleeding from the stump of MACE's leg.  MACE looks awful, pale, in shock.  He speaks weakly. MACE Oh, shit, Todd...I'm...dead... aren't I?  I'm not going to make it. 
TODD meets his look but doesn't answer.  He finishes the tourniquet and turns his back on MACE to peer out through a gap in the engine at the CRAWLER. 
TODD sees the CRAWLER approach the cable, watches it veer left and start to travel along the cable...straight toward the colony! 
TODD turns and looks into MACE's face.  MACE's eyes are clouded with horror. 
MACE Why?  Why? 
No answer. 
MACE I'm not..a soldier. (then...) A...mistake?  Was it...a mistake? 
TODD shakes his head no.  MACE's eyes fill with new horror. 
MACE Oh, my God.  They won't...they won't...?  Not Sandra!  Not... not...Nathan! 
TODD turns away from MACE and peers through the machinery. 
He can see the CRAWLER is a hundred yards away now, traveling along the cable toward the colony. 
He can see the faces of the NEW SOLDIERS hanging on the outside of the CRAWLER, hard faces, goggled and ominous. 
When TODD turns back to MACE, he finds MACE eyeing him with pure hatred.  MACE sneers weakly. 
MACE Soldiers!  Soldiers... (gasp) ...deserve...soldiers! 
His eyes roll back.  He's dead. 
TODD peers out again at the NEW SOLDIERS.  They look invincible as we..

RILEY is standing rigidly in front of his bunk in crew quarters, flanked by the rest of the VETERANS in similar positions, facing SLOAN.

EXT.  INSIDE THE TRENCHES - DAY 
The NEW SOLDIER comes straight, like some inexorable death machine, lumbering awkwardly with his burden of weapons, goggled and blank faced. 
A PIONEER is backing away ten yards in front of him, firing wildly.  POW!  POW!  POW! 
The NEW SOLDIER looks at one of his armor-gloved hands, opening the palm in front of his face.  His hand's been hit.  He shakes it, annoyed, like it was a bee sting, then he aims at the PIONEER. 
WHOOOOSH!  A tongue of fire from the NEW SOLDIER's flame thrower engulfs the helpless PIONEER as we...

But if her demeanor doesn't reveal her fear, her eyes do. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  INSIDE ANOTHER TRENCH - DAY 
Two Pioneers, SALLY and RED, lunge from a doorway into the trench and fire a rifle and a pistol at a THIRD SOLDIER who's advancing along the trench. 
BANG!  BANG!  PING!  SPLAT! 
SALLY and RED dive back in the doorway for cover where a pioneer named SINGH is crouched, watching with alarm the THIRD SOLDIER advancing unfazed. 
ANGLE ON THE THIRD SOLDIER coming toward them. 
ANGLE ON THE PIONEERS huddled in the doorway. 
RED They got armored vests.  You got to aim for exposed parts like the face... 
SINGH Here goes. 
RED and SALLY watch SINGH step out directly in front of the advancing THIRD SOLDIER and FIRE five shots rapidly...PING! PIZG!  PING!  PING!  PING! 
WHOOOOSH!  RED and SALLY see SINGH incinerated before their eyes. 
Exchanging a horrified glance, they turn to retreat down the interior corridor, but before they get two steps, they freeze... 
A SOLDIER is in the corridor, not looking at them, but breaking down a door.  They can't go that way! 
Trapped, they turn to see the THIRD SOLDIER almost to the doorway, his flame thrower aimed, his finger on the trigger, and... 
A blur!  Something lands on the THIRD SOLDIER from above the trench, and the THIRD SOLDIER falls over backwards, slamming hard to the floor of the trench. 
But he's a super soldier, so that almost at the same time he hits the ground he's already lunging upward to regain his feet and fight except... 
A knife blade rips across his throat, opening it wide in one swift movement, and... 
The THIRD SOLDIER's head sags back because not even superman can fight with no neck and the last thing he sees through his plexi goggles is... 
TODD looming over him with a bloody knife, a face like stone, and fierce soldier's eyes. 
ANGLE ON THE DOORWAY, where RED, SALLY, and another PIONEER peer around the corner, eyes wide with amazement at the sight of TODD kneeling over his victim. 
ANGLE ON TODD, slipping the utility belt off the dead THIRD SOLDIER, yanking grenades and ammo from the bulky body, stuffing a heavy pistol in his own waistband. 
RED approaches timidly. 
RED You want help, partner? 
TODD glances up at him, and RED sees TODD'S eyes and RED backs away quickly because... 
TODD looks badder even than the new soldiers! 
Turning back to the dead man, TODD goes for the last item...the goggles.  Ripping them off he reveals... 
A one-eyed soldier.  The dead man staring up at him is MELTON. 
For just a moment TODD stares into the dead face, revealing nothing of how he feels, as we...

INT.  OTHER ROOM - DAY 
NATHAN is SCREAMING in terror on the floor, ignored as SANDRA and CHILDREN haul the bed from the bedroom to add to the heap of obstacles they've placed in front of the door already.  The stove, everything is wedged against the door to the corridor. 
As they heave the bed against the mountain of furniture and other belongings, the door quivers, the heap of furniture shifts.

The FIRST SOLDIER, as big as an offensive tackle, shoulders the door again, and it gives...

CHILDREN SCREAM as the mountain of furniture heaves backwards, and the door opens part way, revealing the FIRST SOLDIER. 
SANDRA grabs NATHAN and hands him to one of the children.

The wind HOWLS, junk drifts and shifts. 
A corpse turns over in the wind.  It's HAWKINS' BODY, ravaged by the turbulent air, as we... 
CUT TO: 
INT.  EARTHEN CORRIDOR/SETTLEMENT - NIGHT 
Someone is dragging a CORPSE down the smoky, lamplit corridor as little NATHAN watches SANDRA tending to the bloody wounds of a PIONEER lying on the floor.  As the CORPSE is dragged past NATHAN, the lifeless, vacant eyes stare right at the uncomprehending little boy. 
NATHAN sees the pioneer's seven year old daughter, ANGIE, sobbing uncontrollably at the sight of her father's wounds.  SANDRA is trying to help with the bandages and console ANGIE at the same time while all round her in the hellish atmosphere people GROAN and children CRY OUT. 
NATHAN doesn't understand it, it's confusing.  MEN and WOMEN loom past him.  He wobbles off down the corridor, toddling away from the sounds of pain. 
SHUK!  KA-SHUK!  Strange SOUNDS come from a doorway ahead, the doorway to the meeting room.  CHAK!  KLAK!  SHIK CHIK KA CHIK! The sound of metal and metal, metal parts CLICKING and SLIDING. 
Alone in the corridor, NATHAN toddles innocently forward, toward the SOUNDS. 
INT.  MEETING ROOM 
NATHAN wobbles into the meeting room doorway and stops there, staring. 
The burnt furniture has been heaped in one corner of the room, leaving a large open space where TODD, bare-chested, a tourniquet on one arm, is squatting on the floor, skillfully reassembling a stripped rifle. 
Surrounding him on the floor in neat piles are the rocket rifles, pistols, ammo clips, utility belts, goggles, torn armor vests, boots, grenades, knives, and flashlights he salvaged from the dead soldiers.  TODD looks up at NATHAN and their eyes meet. 
NATHAN recognizes his "friend," tries a tentative little smile. But TODD just stares at him, and the unformed smile fades from NATHAN's face.  For a long moment they just look each other in the eyes very seriously. 
SANDRA enters, her dress covered with the wounded man's blood. Not noticing TODD, she rushes to NATHAN, grabs him... 
SANDRA Nathan, thank God, there you... 
Suddenly seeing TODD she breaks off, stares at him. 
Squatting on the floor, surrounded by weapons, TODD'S eyes meet hers for a long moment...then he looks away, goes back to assembling the weapons with quick sure movements, almost as if he wanted to avoid her eyes. 
SANDRA wets her lips to speak, hesitates, then finally blurts out what she can hardly bear to ask... 
SANDRA Did he find you? 
No answer.  TODD finishes with the weapon, starts checking the next one. 
SANDRA My husband...Mace...he went out to look for you.  He...found you, didn't he? 
TODD looks up at her and nods.  Their eyes lock. 
SANDRA They...killed him...didn't they? 
TODD nods, turns back to his arsenal. 
SANDRA stands there, hugging NATHAN to her chest, holding her tears in, her lids quivering, fighting to conquer her emotion. After a long, difficult moment, she wins the battle with herself. She looks numb, stunned, but she's not crying. 
TODD has begun to dress.  He straps a sheath knife to one ankle, pulls on boots.  Then he pulls a jersey over his muscular torso, covering all the old scars, the tattooed names of battles, and the tourniquet on his arm. 
Staring at him with glazed eyes, SANDRA notices a blotch of blood form on the jersey, leaking through the tourniquet.  She speaks numbly. 
SANDRA Your wound...it's still bleeding. 
Stuffing his pockets with ammo and other items, TODD glances at her with eyes that glitter dangerously. TODD I like to bleed, sir. 
SANDRA stares at him stupidly as he continues to dress, pulling on a heavy armored vest. 
SANDRA It doesn't...hurt? 
TODD pulls on a second armored vast, one that already has a ragged hole in it from a rocket. 
TODD Not enough, sir. 
SANDRA watches him go to the heap of charred furniture in the corner and take a blackened stick from it, watches him smear charcoal under his eyes. 
SANDRA How do you know they'll come back? 
TODD looks at her, a savage with blackened eyes. 
TODD They're soldiers, sir.  Like me. 
SANDRA What...what do they want? 
TODD Nothing. 
SANDRA Nothing? 
TODD They are obeying orders, sir.  It's their duty. 
For a moment SANDRA is silent, then... 
SANDRA You know who they are, don't you? Do you know how many there'll be? 
TODD crosses two utility belts across his armored chest like bandoliers. 
TODD Seventeen more, sir. 
SANDRA Seventeen!  My God! (suddenly energized) You can't fight seventeen yourself! You have to organize the rest of us, show us what to do.  We don't have your...your skills...but we're not cowards.  We'll do what you tell us, we'll -- 
TODD (interrupting, softly) No. 
His voice is soft as silk but hard as steel.  She looks into his eyes.  Does she detect a hint of approval, of respect, in those flat expressionless snake eyes? 
SANDRA Why not? 
TODD turns to go, laden with weapons, a flamethrower on his back, a rocket rifle on his shoulder, another in one hand. 
TODD Soldiers deserve soldiers, sir. 
SANDRA But...one soldier against seventeen! 
INT.  CRAWLER ONE 
Maneuvering across the junk-strewn landscape, the DRIVER peers through the cracked windshield at the green terrain, looking for TODD as the RADIO crackles... 
RADIO Crawler Two to Crawler One.  Do you have a sitrep? 
THE GUNNER and the DRIVER exchange a glance.  The GUNNER takes the mike and speaks into it. 
GUNNER Crawler Two, we are one down, responding to sniper activity. 
INT.  CRAWLER TWO 
CAINE 607 is at the wheel, speaking into his mike. 
CAINE 607 Crawler One, do you require assistance? 
RADIO That is negative.  We will eliminate the sniper and rendezvous at target. 
CAINE 607 Roger, One.  We are proceeding to target. 
CAINE 607 accelerates the CRAWLER. 
EXT.  JUNK TERRAIN 
The flare fades and the near darkness returns. 
ANGLE ON NEW SOLDIER ONE peering out into the stillness, then signaling NEW SOLDIER TWO who's hiding nearby. 
As the two NEW SOLDIERS step out from their sheltered positions, they're joined by NEW SOLDIER THREE.  Exchanging hand signals, the three of them advance, spreading out cautiously. 
NEW SOLDIER THREE has moved about thirty yards away when suddenly he "disappears." 
EXT.  INSIDE A "CATCM TRENCH" 
SPLASH!  SOLDIER THREE has tumbled into a flooded trench. 
He struggles to his feet, can't figure out where he is.  He pulls a flashlight from his waist and shines it down the trench in both directions. 
The flashlight beam reveals a steep-walled trench knee-deep in water and littered with rusting junk. 
NEW SOLDIER THREE splashes along the trench, looking for a way out. 
His light reveals a piece of a derrick mast leaning against the trench, a perfect ladder. 
He's slogging toward it when he whirls suddenly and splays his beam down the trench behind him. 
NEW SOLDIER THREE'S POV of the flooded trench.  Junk and water. 
ANGLE ON NEW SOLDIER THREE, turning back and approaching the ladder.  Just as he reaches the ladder he whirls again. 
Again his light illuminates the spooky trench.  Again, nothing but water and junk. 
Relieved, he's just about to switch off his light when... 
TODD rises out of the water only five feet away like a demon. 
Before NEW SOLDIER THREE can cry out, TODO lunges at him. EXT.  JUNK TERRAIN 
As he creeps cautiously through the gloom, NEW SOLDIER ONE stiffens.  Was that a stifled CRY?  Or not? 
NEW SOLDIER ONE signals NEW SOLDIER TWO and the two of them turn and move cautiously toward where NEW SOLDIER THREE was. 
EXT.  INSIDE THE TRENCH 
TODD'S light reveals NEW SOLDIER THREE slumped in the water, his head askew, neck broken, eyes vacant.  TODD is hastily rummaging through the soldier's equipment, looking for something. 
He finds it. 
EXT.  JUNK TERRAIN 
NEW SOLDIERS ONE and TWO are approaching the trench when suddenly a flare bursts above them. 
The NEW SOLDIERS react with amazement as the flare exposes them in a brightly illuminated landscape.  Before they can take cover... 
BUDDA BUDDA BUDDA.  Flashes of fire from the lip of the trench. 
NEW SOLDIER ONE drops dead, NEW SOLDIER TWO is down and writhing on the ground, SCREAMING. 
ANGLE ON CRAWLER ONE veering sharply toward the trench, accelerating, FIRING ROCKETS, CANONS, MACHINE GUNS.... 
ANGLE ON THE OTHER NEW SOLDIERS, prone, firing toward the trench. 
EXT.  INSIDE THE TRENCH 
Tracers whizzing over the top of the trench illuminate TODD as he races down the trench, running for his life. 
EXT.  JUNK TERRAIN 
Still firing, CRAWLER ONE grinds up to the lip of the trench. 
ANGLE ON NEW SOLDIERS charging toward the trench behind the CRAWLER. 
CLOSE ON CRAWLER ONE'S HOOD where a small trap opens and a nozzle pops out like a little penis and...SQUIRTS a stream of liquid! The liquid stream arcs fifty yards along the trench and diminishes backward like a man pissing... 
INT.  INSIDE THE TRENCH 
TODD looks back just before be rounds a corner in the trench, sees the liquid hitting the water in the trench. 
Sheltered from their view by the turn in the trench, TODD tries to scale the steep wall of the trench. 
WHOOOOOOOOOSH!  The surface of the water-filled trench bursts into flame.  A fiery river of flammable liquid. 
ANGLE ON NEW SOLDIERS reacting to something! 
NEW SOLDIERS' POV of TODD, visible in the firelight as he rolls over the lip of the trench fifty yards from them. 
ANGLE ON THE NEW SOLDIERS firing as they move toward TODD. They've got him now! 
Peering through the scope as he sweeps the terrain, the GUNNER suddenly stiffens and back-pans to find something... 
GUNNER Tentative at One. 
The DRIVER angles right, aiming for one o'clock. 
GUNNER That's negative, no target. 
The DRIVER swings the wheel back and they continue slowly through the darkness. 
In the back seat, two NEW SOLDIERS peer into the night with blank faces.  One of them is watching a huge plastic sign cartwheel past in the wind when -- 
-- he reacts! 
-- as TODD'S face appears is only inches from his, right against the plexi! 
BAM!  Before the NEW SOLDIER can do more than look startled, TODD shoots out the window with a pistol and shoves a live grenade through the hole. 
NEW SOLDIER RED!  RED!  RE -- 
BAWHOOOM!  The grenade EXPLODES and... 
The DRIVER fights for control of the wheel. 
The GUNNER screams and screams and screams like a machine running at high speed while the two NEW SOLDIERS lie open-eyed with death in the back seat. 
EXT.  CRAWLER 
No sign of TODD.  Disappeared again. 
As the wind ROARS furiously, the damaged CRAWLER limps along. 
INT.  CRAWLER ONE 
The dying GUNNER is making awful noises while the DRIVER, eyes glazed, his face streaming with blood, maneuvers the vehicle slowly and cautiously, looking for the enemy... 
But all he sees through the cracked windshield is a shadowy world of wind-tossed debris. 
EXT.  JUNK TERRAIN 
Protected by a hunk of pipe, TODD crouches and watches the CRAWLER, his eyes glittering, his weapon ready.  It's clear now that the tables are turned and he is the hunter as we... 
CUT TO: 
INT.  CORRIDORS - NIGHT 
EXPLOSIONS!  SCREAMS!  BAWHOOM!  Another shell hits, beams splinter, dirt walls collapse. 
Eight-year old JOHNNY, alone and terrified, comes in to view around a corner.  He's been separated from the others. 
JOHNNY DAD!  DAAAAAAD! 
No answer. 
JOHNNY doesn't know which way to go.  The world's falling apart! 
WHUMP!  The little warren of earthen corridors is shaken by another BLAST. 
Desperate, JOHNNY makes a left, away from the last blast and hurries down a collapsing corridor past doorways that reveal rooms with no ceilings where the wind HOWLS.  It's obvious the shelling has been going on for a while. 
JOHNNY DAAAAAAAD! 
Just then, JIMMY PIG pops out of a doorway in front of him and and rushes toward him. 
JIMMY PIG GOTCHA! 
BA-WHOOM!  Another shell collapses the corridor behind JOHNNY as JIMMY PIG grabs him and hauls him toward the door he emerged from, the Dining Commons. 
INT.  DINING COMMONS 
EMMA is ushering CHILDREN through a trap door in the floor into the root cellar as JIMMY PIG ushers JOHNNY into the room. 
JOHNNY Where's my father?  Where's my father? 
JOHNNY looks around urgently. 
SANDRA is bandaging TOMMY'S arm while ELLEN, NATHAN, and WILL are huddling under a table in the most protected corner of the room. 
JIMMY PIG and JUDITH exchange a pained look as JIMMY PIG pushes JOHNNY toward SANDRA and the table. 
JIMMY PIG Johnny, get over under that table with Miss Sandra and Ellen and the others.  Miss Judith, you better go on down the root cellar with Emma and help with the ones down there. 
JOHNNY Where's my mother? 
BAH-DOOOM!  Another fierce CONCUSSION twenty yards away shakes dirt from the ceiling.  ELLEN beckons from under the table... 
ELLEN Come on, Johnny. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  SETTLEMENT - NIGHT 
MUZZLE FLASH!  FFFWHOOOMP!  CRAWLER TWO fires another round. 
The vehicle is squatting not thirty yards from the trench garden, pouring round after round into the colony, lighting the night with bright-colored flowery blasts. 
Crouched in the wind not far from the vehicle, the two NEW SOLDIERS from the back seat have set up a mortar, and they too are firing away. 
INT.  CRAWLER TWO/STATlONARY 
The GUNNER is looking through his scope, methodically aiming and firing as CAINE 607 at the wheel watches impassively. 
KA-FOOMP!  Another shot, the vehicle rocks, and, five hundred yards away, fire and dirt fountain thirty feet into the air. 
BEEP!  BEEP!  A light on the dash blinks on.  CAINE 607 switches on a radarscope, spots a blip. 
The GUNNER takes his eyes off the scope, looks at the blip. 
JIMMY PIG starts chopping furiously. 
SLADE picks up a rifle, hands it to RED. 
SLADE Do what you can. 
As RED looks at the rifle, alarmed, SLADE "comforts" him. 
SLADE They're gonna kill us anyhow.  No point in surrendering. (grabbing the axe) Turn! 
JIMMY PIG gasps for air as SLADE takes over chopping again. 
RED exits, worried. 
INT.  THE MEETING ROOM 
Huddled in a makeshift shelter of overturned furniture, with NATHAN asleep on her lap, SANDRA is reciting to ELLEN, WILL, TOMMY, JOHNNY, ANGIE, eight year old RAMON. 
SANDRA "-- sailed an a river of crystal light into a sea of dew.  Where are you going and what do you wish the old moon asked the three.  'We've come to fish for herring fish...'" 
TOMMY What's a "moon?" 
JOHNNY I know what a moon is!  It's... 
SANDRA (suddenly, urgently) SHHHHHHH! 
SANDRA is reacting to vague movement in the shadows beyond the door...and sounds. 
She puts her hand over the mouth of a whimpering CHILD, hushes another. 
A timber falls outside the door and SANDRA sees a shadowy shape enter the meeting room, looming in the darkness. 
Frightened CHILDREN hold their breath, peer out fearfully. 
CRACK!  SMASH!  The huge shape hurls aside the debris in his way, switches on a flashlight, probes the darkness. 
The light wipes the damaged room. 
Suddenly, SANDRA gasps. 
SANDRA Oh, my God!  It's... it's you! 
TODD maneuvers the flashlight beam, sees the frightened CHILDREN. 
SANDRA Are you...all right? 
TODD We should go, sir. 
SANDRA Go? 
INT.  CORRIDOR 
Peering into the smoke, RED reacts. 
RED'S POV of CAINE 607, obscured by smoke, crossing the corridor ahead, not seeing RED. 
ANGLE ON RED, summoning all his courage, raising his rifle, aiming. 
BANG! 
ANGLE ON CAINE 607 reacting, looking toward RED. 
ANGLE ON RED scared to death, firing again!  And again! 
ANGLE ON CAINE 607 wrenching a heavy door from its hinges and holding it in front of him, shielding himself from RED's continuous shooting, advancing. 
ANGLE ON RED, firing again and again...and backing up. 
ANGLE ON CAINE 607 holding the door/shield as he advances on RED. 
Backing, RED trips, goes down flat on his back. 
CAINE 607, only six feet away, hurls the door at him. 
RED shoves the door aside, aims his gun up at CAINE 607, as the huge soldier looms over him. 
Before RED can pull the trigger, CAINE 607 snatches the rifle barrel and yanks the weapon out of RED'S hands. 
RED rolls, scrambles to his feet. 
And CAINE 607 clubs him to the ground with the butt of the rifle, crushes his skull with three brutal blows. 
INT.  ROOM 
TODD'S impassive face somehow reveals the alarm and awkwardness he feels at what's happening to him.  TOMMY is seated on his shoulders, he's got NATHAN in one arm and JOHNNY is nervously looking up at him as he clutches at TODD'S huge free hand, and now a little girl, SARAH, clutches at his combat pants as SANDRA instructs her. 
SANDRA Sarah, you hang on to Sergeant Todd. No matter what happens! 
Clutching TODD's combat pants fiercely, SARAH looks up timidly at the big stonefaced man as SANDRA turns to ELLEN. 
SANDRA Ellen, go to the Commons.  Tell Jimmy Pig and Mr. Slade that Sergeant Todd says we have to leave as soon as they get everybody out of the root-cellar.  Can you do that? 
ELLEN (scared) Uh, yes, ma'am. 
SANDRA It's all right.  The soldiers are gone for now.  But be careful where you walk.  And if it's too smoky, just come back. 
SARAH (on her way out) Yes, ma'am. 
SANDRA (calling after her) Tell them to bring all the food and clothing they can carry. (turning to the children) Do you all understand that Sergeant Todd here is going to help us, and whatever he says to do you must do immediately, as if he was your father or your mother. 
SARAH (tears) He's not my father! 
ANGLE ON TODD'S stone face.  Unfamiliar territory. 
SANDRA No... but he's our friend.  Our good friend.  Do you understand? 
Frightened faces look to the awkward "killing machine." 
CHURCH Not only are we apparently out twenty of your fancy new soldiers, your supermen, we're out both crawlers and all the weapons...so we can't arm the old soldiers, the ones you "improved" on, to defend ourselves... 
SLOAN (panicky, blurting at the screen) We've got to get out of here, Colonel Mekum! 
CHURCH flashes a scowl at SLOAN as, on the screen, MEKUM erupts excitedly. 
MEKUM/VIDEO IMAGE Abort?  You want to lose twenty top soldiers to a phantom army and then abort the mission?  Do you know what that would look like on my record? Or yours?  We'd be explaining it for the next fifty years from some goddam assignment in God knows where, we'd -- 
CHURCH (interrupting sharply) Well, how's it gonna look when we lose the ship too?  How's that gonna look on the old record?  'Cause that's what's gonna happen if we don't get our ass outta here.  We can't defend ourselves with no weapons and -- 
MEKUM/VIDEO IMAGE (fighting his own panic) Hold on, hold on there, Captain!  At ease!  Let's calm down and remember...remember we're soldiers. 
CHURCH (sarcastic) Good plan, Colonel. 
MEKUM/VIDEO IMAGE (moving on, improvising) Now we can't just get the shit kicked out of us by an unknown guerilla army...  But maybe we could...alter...our objective... 
CHURCH Meaning? 
MEKUM/VIDEO IMAGE Nuke the joint...and get out! 
Delighted with his own genius, MEKUM smiles triumphantly from the video screen as RUBRICK, SLOAN, and CHURCH exchange stunned looks and we... 
CUT TO: 
INT.  MEETING ROOM - NIGHT 
WHUMP!  TODD's bloodied head is slammed on the floor.  His eyes are almost swollen shut as he looks up at CAINE 607 kneeling on top of him.  Both men are bloody and exhausted their breath coming in gasps, but it's CAINE 607 who's on top, beating the last bit of resistance out of TODD who struggles desperately one more time...before he slumps unconscious. 
Horrified, NATHAN sees CAINE 607 smash the unconscious TODD with the last of his strength, "finishing him off."  NATHAN can't stand it. 
He toddles toward CAINE 607, who's still on all fours, and attacks, his tiny fists raining blows on the amazed monster's bloody face. 
The frightened CHILDREN see CAINE 607 ignore NATHAN's ineffectual blows and struggle with enormous effort to his feet. 
Once standing, he looks down at NATHAN beating at his knees.  For a moment he's confused.  What's this? 
Then he sees the frightened CHILDREN and orients himself.  When he looks down at NATHAN again, tiny NATHAN is an enemy as good as dead.  One blow and... 
But just then big hands close around CAINE 607's ankles, tackling him.  As the giant topples, TODD lets go of the ankles and crawls on top of the fallen man. 
As CAINE 607 looks up into TODD's fierce face, the fight goes out of his eyes.  He knows he's beaten, he knows TODD will never quit.  He's helpless as TODD grips him in a terrible hold and as TODD puts the pressure on, CAINE 607 whispers... 
CAINE 607 It hurts! 
TODD (sympathetic) I know. 
SNAP!  TODD breaks CAINE 607's neck and watches the life go out of him. 
In the sudden silence as TODD, panting, stares at his defeated enemy, he hears a VOICE...her VOICE...very weak... 
SANDRA Sergeant... 
TODD turns and sees SANDRA slumped against the wall where Caine 607 threw her.  There's a trickle of blood coming from a nostril, more blood in her hair.  Her eyes don't look right. 
SANDRA Nathan! 
TODD sees NATHAN looking at his mother with fear in his eyes. Struggling to his feet, TODD picks up NATHAN and puts the boy down close to his mother. 
SANDRA reaches out and takes NATHAN's hand.  She holds NATHAN's hand toward TODD. 
TODD looks confused. 
There are tears in SANDRA's eyes as she pushes NATHAN's little hand into TODD's huge left paw. 
TODD looks down at the joined hands, then he looks into SANDRA's flooded eyes. 
Does TODD understand her gesture?  His face is impassive.  Maybe he doesn't.  Just then a hand touches his shoulder. 
TODD turns to see JOHNNY face him, trembling but valiant, to ask the question the others are fearful of asking. 
JOHNNY S-sir...sir, are you our friend? (indicating Sandra) Sh-she said you were our friend. 
TODD sees all the CHILDREN looking at him, their eyes big with hope and fear as we... 
CUT TO: 
INT.  DINING COMMONS 
Blackened with soot, JIMMY PIG still has the axe in his hand as SLADE manages, with a supreme effort, to hold the door of the root cellar up enough to allow EMMA and JUDITH to push the FOUR CHILDREN out of the cellar and then to scramble after them. 
Exhausted, SLADE lets the door fall back, picks up his rifle and turns toward the exit.  And freezes.  Dumbfounded. 
Standing in the doorway is TODD, laden with CHILDREN, on his shoulders, in his arms, surrounding him, clutching at his garments. 
SLADE You! 
JIMMY PIG Thank God! 
CUT TO: 
INT.  CORRIDOR/"DADDY" - NIGHT 
CRUDE LETTERS scrawled on the metal skin of the bomb say "LOVE FROM DADDY." 
The heavy bomb is lugged along a long narrow corridor. 
SLOAN (O.S.) Well, Riley, you wanted a weapon, right?  Now you got one!  A real biggee! 
We see that RILEY and three other VETERANS -- GREEN, CHESLEY, and MOORE -- are struggling to maneuver the heavy bomb along the narrow corridor and down a ladder hatch as SLOAN follows on their heels and CHURCH and RUBRICK, fretting, follow her. 
RUBRICK What good'll it do just setting it outside?  We don't know where the enemy is. 
CHURCH Doesn't matter.  For once Mekum's on the ball. This is a very dirty bomb!  That wind will churn the radioactivity around like soap in a washing machine.  This is gonna be one clean place in a very short time... 
CUT TO: 
INT.  BOWELS OF THE SHIP - NIGHT 
a glimpse of RUBRICK being shoved roughly along the corridor by MOORE, his loud protests clearly audible. 
RUBRICK Are you crazy?  You can't do this, soldier!  You're going to be in trouble. 
Then, as RUBRICK is pushed out of view, CHURCH appears, indignant and panicky, as CHESLEY hustles him past. 
CHURCH I'm your superior officer, don't you understand that? 
ANGLE ON THE PIONEERS, exchanging glances. 
INT.  CORRIDOR/"DADDY" 
As CHESLEY shoves him along, CHURCH continues to protest... 
CHURCH Don't you realize you're violating the chain of command?  I'm giving you a direct order to...to...to... 
CHURCH breaks off, suddenly speechless at the sight ahead of him. 
Here comes TODD, laden with more CHILDREN, the tattoo on his cheek clearly visible.  His eyes meet CHURCH'S. 
CHURCH S-sergeant?  S-sergeant T-todd? It...  You...!  How...?  How...? 
Weak at the knees, CHURCH is still stammering as CHESLEY shoves him ahead. 
And then SLOAN, in the grip of GREEN, is hustled by.  She looks wide-eyed at TODD and the CHILDREN. 
SLOAN Sergeant Todd! 
CUT TO: 
INT.  BOWELS OF THE SHIP - NIGHT - SECONDS LATER 
RUBRICK, CHURCH, and SLOAN are still protesting as the VETERANS hustle them down the ladder toward the main hatch. 
RUBRICK Listen, you don't understand!  That bomb is triggered!  It's on a timer! 
CHURCH We have to get out of here!  All of us!  You need us!  You need us to operate the ship... 
SLOAN YOU'RE FUCKING MORONS!  CAN'T YOU DIMWITS GRASP THAT YOU'RE KILLING US ALL!  YOU'RE KILLING YOURSELVES! THERE'S ONLY A FEW MINUTES LEFT! 
RUBRICK NO!  NO!  NO! 
RUBRICK is shoved out the door into the night! 
EXT.  SPACESHIP/"DADDY" - NIGHT 
RUBRICK desperately clutches at the hatch entrance as the savage wind tears at him...but he can't hold on. 
As SLOAN and CHURCH are shoved out the hatch, they see RUBRICK blown off into the night, screaming. 
CHURCH DOWN!  LIE DOWN!  FLAT! 
And CHURCH dives for the ground as the wind tumbles him. 
SLOAN does the same thing as the hatch door slams behind them, shutting them out of the ship.. 
SLOAN NO!  NO!  NO!  PLEASE!  NO! 
INT.  COCKPIT/"DADDY" - NIGHT 
The countdown clock shows four minutes and twenty seconds as it CLICKS off the seconds. 
Their soldier faces inscrutable, TODD and RUBRICK consider the various lights winking on the control panel. 
RILEY points to a row of switches and looks at TODD.  Their eyes meet.  TODD considers the switches, then nods. 
RILEY throws the switches.  A row of red lights goes on and the ship seems to hum with life. 
Still communicating wordlessly, TODD points to another switch, RILEY throws it! 
EXT.  SPACESHIP/"DADDY" 
BLAST OFF!  Big engines belch fire, illuminating the bleak landscape as the ship rises into the night. 
Brightly lit by the ignition, SLOAN, still on her belly, sees the ship taking off. 
SLOAN OH, MY GOD!  OH, MY GOD! 
CHURCH THERE IT IS!  I SEE IT! 
The bomb is clearly visible ten yards away in the dying glow of the takeoff. 
CHURCH bumps madly along the ground on his belly. 
EXT.  SPACESHIP/"DADDY" 
The NAF ship "Daddy" climbs off into space, getting smaller and smaller, the light from the takeoff diminishing. EXT.  THE BOMB/TERRAIN 
The countdown timer on the bomb is faintly visible in the dying light.  It reads twenty seconds. 
CHURCH (V.O.) Twenty seconds.  Hurry. 
CHURCH and SLOAN are hunched desperately over the bomb in near darkness, the wind tearing at them.  SLOAN tries to punch a code into the keys... 
SLOAN Oh, my God, I can't remember if it's six-seven or seven-six... 
CHURCH Try one! Try it! 
SLOAN punches the keyboard blindly. 
SLOAN There!  I did it!  Did it stop?  Did it -- ? 
BAHWHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!  Everything is dazzling, blinding light! 
INT.  COCKPIT/"DADDY" 
White light from the blast briefly floods the cockpit as TODD and RILEY stare at the video monitor where MEKUM'S VIDEO IMAGE is babbling frantically.

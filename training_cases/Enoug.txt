GINNY He likes you. 
SLIM I think he's just a dick. 
GINNY Slim...he was in yesterday - 
SLIM I know - 
GINNY And he's back today with a rose, he pulls you into conversation. Honey, if you can't tell he likes you, you need to study psychology. 
SLIM Okay, so he likes me. 
GINNY Do you like him? 
SLIM I don't know him. 
GINNY What's that got to do with it? Slim: he is a major piece of cake/piece of pie. 
SLIM I didn't notice. 
GINNY Trust me. Carrot cake. And when a guy like that - cuter than you? - he actually likes you - 
SLIM He's cuter than me?? tinny gives her a long stare; this is obviously a favorite 
ROUTINE: 
GINNY Hey. Wise up, huh? No-one is ever gonna go for you 'cause of your looks. 
SLIM 
(NODS SOBERLY) That is bad news, 'cause my personality bites. Ginny grins. Slim writes up a check for a CUSTOMER at the counter. When she finishes, the turkey burger is up. She carries it to the table: 
SLIM TB, coleslaw, and so forth. You don't really write books, do you? 
OUR HERO Nope. 
SLIM I don't read Finnecan's Wake either. 
OUR HERO I'm goin' into law. Enforcement. She nods. This is more like what she expected. 
SLIM Who's the rose for? He shrugs. She's busy, so she starts to go: 
SLIM Enjoy your grub, huh? She's seven feet away when she hears: 
OUR HERO 
HEY - Sheturns back toward him - He smiles, offers the rose: 
OUR HERO You. She smiles back-their eyes meet... a sudden utterly magical moment. This is also the moment to.note OUR HERO should be played by a famous actor doing a cameo. Because at this instant the scene changes. The man (MITCH) in the booth behind Our Hero - a man we haven't noticed because all we've seen is the back of his head - turns and looks at Slim. Stands. Looks down at Our Hero... 
MITCH How much did you settle on? 
OUR HERO Excuse. me? Slim frowns, steps closer so she can overhear: 
MITCH The bet. How much is it? Our Hero has a completely blank look on his face - 
MITCH (CONT.) You and your friend. Yesterday. Was it 200 or 500 or - ? 
SLIM 
(TO MITCH) What're you - 
MITCH He bet his friend he could get in your pants in less than twelve hours, starting noon today. Our Hero rises to his feet and pushes Mitch in the chest, which looks like a stupid move, since Mitch is bigger - 
GINNY Why am I not believing this? 
(INTRIGUED) Can I take you home right now? 
JOE If you've got a sense of humor. 
GINNY My kids are out for the night, and... 
JOE Another thing: I live in Chicago; women always want the possibility of 
LONG-TERM - 
GINNY I didn't propose, huh? I just want to have... (looks at him...) a brief and completely unsatisfying sexual encounter. 
JOE Hey. I'm your guy. She pulls him into a kiss, and...well: he's not a bad kisser... We glide from them to Slim and Mitch, hardly moving. Suddenly: tender and insecure and almost comic, she looks at him... 
SLIM You sure,you love me? 
MITCH Uh-huh... 
SLIM For ever and ever? He stops dancing. Senses the real issue beneath her questions: 
MITCH You're safe with me, Slim. You're safe, and it's okay to be happy. We deserve it. They kiss. Others stop to watch: how cute. Phil comes over, waits. When they break: 
PHIL I'm sorry, I gotta get up five o'clock to buy green beans. He slips an envelope into Mitch's hand: 
PHIL In my country, it's tradition to give money to groom. You don't need it, but... Slim shakes her head, touched, as: 
MITCH That's very sweet - 
SLIM 
(HUGGING PHIL) Thanks for giving me away, okay? You're the best substitute Dad a girl could possibly have. 
PHIL No substitute. I am real thing. She kisses him, and he goes. They look after him. 
MITCH He really loves you. She nods, not quite picking up how odd his statement is: of course he loves her; she nicked him to give her away. Mitch turns her toward him and slips his hands inside the top of her dress (so the back of his hands touch her breasts; is this going too far?). He pulls her to him, whispers: 
MITCH You gonna give me babies? 
SLIM Oh yeah. 
MITCH How soon? 
SLIM How soon can we get out of here? He hoists her into his arms and carries her off the floor. Applause from the GUESTS. It's a grand romantic gesture. You have to wonder if Mitch is just a little too good to be true... 
CUT TO: 
CONQUERING HERO 
EXT. SPANISH-STYLE HOUSE WITH GROUNDS. DAY. 
Slim (4 months pregnant) stands'on the walkway leading up to a large, simple,' beautiful house. Mitch is knocking at the door. The man who answers the door is 62, white-haired, vigorous. Looks like he walked out of a Viagra ad. 
HOME OWNER Hello? 
MITCH Hi. We've been driving around, and my wife has completely fallen in love with your house. 
HOME OWNER It's great, isn't it? 
MITCH We want to buy it. The Home Owner's jaw drops as Mitch gestures toward his bulging 
WIFE: 
IS Keeps laughing, which really gets Gracie going. Mitch looks on, tries to join in, but it's forced-and besides that: they're not even looking at him, not inviting his laughter; it's all between the mother and child. So he stops trying. Just watches them. And before his eyes, they become - for an instant - strangers. As this reaction, and the subtle hostility it engenders, flicker across his face, Slim looks up at him - For one long moment they both seem to acknowledge the gulf between them... Then Gracie says something. Slim turns back toward her, the "girls" are laughing again...and Mitch is not. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BATHROOM/BEDROOM. NIGHT. 
SHOWER STALL. Glass, opaque, streaked with water and soap so as to give a slightly freaky aspect. Someone inside. Slim watching. Smiles. Starts to take off her clothes. 
SLIM Hey. 
MITCH Hey. 
SLIM 
(FLIRTATIOUS) Should I join you? 
MITCH I'm about to get out. 
SLIM (down to her panties) Oh. 
MITCH I have to go to back to work, I'm just doing this to wake myself up. 
SLIM 
(DISAPPOINTED) Okay. (starts to go) 
MITCH 
(CALLS) Sorry. 
SLIM 
(TO HERSELF) Yeah. (Me too.) She's in the bedroom now. It's underlit, full of shadows. In scary-movie nomenclature, she's exposed, vulnerable; it feels like someone's going to leap out and attack her at any - Not this time. She throws on shorts and a t-shirt - 
INT. HALL. NIGHT. 
She looks in on Gracie, sleeping peacefully. Consoling image. 
INT. KITCHEN. NIGHT. 
She's washing dishes, bored, humming to herself. The counter's covered with take-out food containers: she didn't cook. A noise. Pager. Not beeping, just humming slightly: she wouldn't even hear it except it's on the tile counter. Sounds vaguely like a vibrator. Lying there, just a few feet from her. With Mitch's wallet and keys, his cell phone. She looks at it. .knows she shouldn't... decides not to... Can't resist. Dries her.hands methodically on a dishtowel. Picks up the pager. Reads: 33. She stares, realizing: it's code. She looks at the cell phone. Wonders whether... Looks toward the hall. We HEAR the shower still running... She picks up his cell phone. Tentatively - she's not sure this will work - she presses: RECALL 33. The phone flashes NAME, but instead of a name there's: . She stares at this, glances again down the hall-takes a deep breath.. .and presses SEND. Waits... listens nervously... 
WOMAN'S VOICE 
(FLIRTATIOUS) Hello there. 
SLIM You just paged my husband, right? 
(HALF BEAT) Mitch. 
(HALF BEAT) Who are you, what's your name? 
WOMAN'S VOICE I'm sorry, I - 
SLIM It's too late to deny it. Tell me your - (name) A rustle on the other end - 
SLIM (CONT.) Don't hang upl Don't be a cowardl Silence. 
SLIM (CONT.) Just your name. That's the least you could do, don't you think? A simple plea, one woman to another... 
WOMAN'S VOICE I'm...Darcelle. Not only the name. Now we hear it in the accent: she's French. Dialtone. Slim goes into slow motion. How oddly her arm moves downward. She looks at the phone. Blinks. Presses OFF. Scans the room as if she's never seen it before. One of Gracie's toys lies on the floor. Slim stares at it. Reaches down to pick it up, but instead of the toy moving up, her body moves down. She slumps to the floor. Sits. Stares. 
WIDER ANGLE. MINUTES LATER. Slim sitting on the floor. Frozen. Head bowed. 
Knocking her to the ground. Stands over her like a boxer. Sees rase flare across her face - 
MITCH You want to fight? I'm a mom, honey; it's no contest. She's silent, but we see (very small) her reaction: Oh yeah?? 
MITCH {CONT.} You have to understand, Slim. I thought you did: make the money here, so I set the rules, right? It's my rules. He waits for her response, but again she's silent. 
MITCH You with me? 
SLIM It's your rules. 
MITCH Yeah. She keeps her voice meek so as not to offend: 
SLIM And if I don't like the rules?? 
MITCH If you don't "like" them?! She nods cautiously. 
MITCH {CONT.} Come on. Life isn't onl stuff we like. We take the good with the bad, right? That's what life is, what marriage is. So maybe, for you, today is a bad day. Tomorrow may be great. 
SLIM Tomorrow may be great. 
MITCH That's right. 
SLIM Tomorrow will be great. (Without you . ) He appears to miss her inference. 
MITCH Yeah. Today is the price you pay for having such a good life. She stares at him. 
MITCH I'm going out. She says nothing. 
MITCH {CONT.} This is gonna be better, don't you think? She just cannot process the absurdity of this statement. 
MITCH {CONT.} I don't have to sneak around, pretend I'm going to work. I can just say: "I'm going to Darcelle's, I'll be back in a few hours." Her face is completely blank. He bends down, gives her a kiss on the head. We feel her skin crawl. She watches him go. Waits. Hears the front door close. She gets up, walks to the window, watches him walk toward his car. She turns away, looks at the room. We HEAR his car start. She goes to the phone. Thinks. Starts to dial-slowly, deliberately... Shock: RAP AT THE WINDOW! He's there. 
She reacts with guilt, but he doesn't look angry now. Behind him is his idling Mercedes convertible, driver's door open... He motions for her to open the window. She does. 
MITCH Who you calling? 
SLIM Your mother. 
MITCH What're you gonna tell her? 
SLIM I'm supposed to bring Gracie tomorrow. Maybe I better cancel. 
MITCH 
(NODS) I was thinking. You...you know that I adore you, but if you ever want...if you want out... For a second he can't talk. He's choked up. She watches coldly. His emotion appears real, but who cares? 
MITCH (CONT.) .I'll understand. I really will. 
(ALMOST TENDER) But there's one thing: you can't have Gracie. She's my daughter. Don't even think about taking her. Slim stares at him. He adds calmly: 
MITCH (CONT.) If I see that thought even cross your mind, I'll kill you. There. He's said what he needs to. He walks toward his car. She shuts the window. Stares after him. In an odd and defiant way, she starts to whistle. Loudly. To herself. Almost daring him. 
He keeps walking. 
CUT TO: 
OUTTA HERE 
INT. CAR. DAY. 
Emotional, impressionistic. CLOSE ON her face, almost inside her skin: a visual symphony. The countryside behind her is out of focus, a blur. She pulls up at a gate, punches in a code. Drives up a long a driveway to: 
EXT. PASADENA ESTATE. DAY. 
MITCH That's right. 
PHIL Then we die young. The others are uncertain, but Phil helps Slim up; Teddy joins him. Ginny tentatively follows his lead and picks up Gracie.. 
SLIM 
(VERY SOFT) (This is no good.) You're humiliating him. 
GINNY What? 
SLIM (a little louder) He'll come after me and kill me. Mitch overhears this, smiles. 
MITCH You hear that? That's why she loves me. (off their horrified looks) Nobody cares like I do. The others stare at him in astonishment, but continue toward the door. Mitch leans toward Slim, whispers: 
MITCH See you soon. 
CUT TO: 
INT. VAN. NIGHT. 
Gracie awake now in Slim's arms: staring, confused. Gentle rocking of the van. The others barely visible, like shadows. 
CHECK, PLEASE 
INT. AIRPLANE. DAY. 
Gracie asleep, Slim holding her. Blinds down, movie playing. Despite Gracie's age, the angle and soft lighting make this resemble a Madonna and child... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. NAVY PIER (CHICAGO). EVENING. 
Open air market: shops, stalls; yuppie heaven. Slim carries Gracie on her shoulders. They're with Jog (her old boyfriend, from the wedding). Horsing around, having a good time, Gracie eating a pastry. They stop and look out at Lake Michigan. 
SLIM Wow ... whattaya think, Toots? 
GRACIE It's a big ocean! 
JOE Well. It's only a lake, but we like it. 
GRACIE (nods, stares out... Can we stay here a while? 
CUT TO: 
INT. JOE'S CAR. NIGHT. 
They're driving along, suddenly Joe says - 
JOE Coming up, whattaya say?! 
GRACIE & SLIM 
(A GAME) Bobbing for apples! Slim (front seat) and Gracie (back) both drop their heads so they can't be seen from outside the car - Joe turns the corner, presses a garage door opener, and drives into the basement garage of a nice-looking 4-plex. 
INT. JOE'S 4-PLEX. NIGHT. 
They come in from the garage, throw off their coats. All the curtains in the apartment are drawn. 
JOE Is there anybody who likes ice cream? Gracie whoops - The doorbell rings - 
Slim and Joe freeze - Slim whips her hand over Gracie's mouth - Gracie looks horrified: why are you covering my - Slim puts her finger to her mouth: shhh. She takes Gracie's hand; they scurry out of sight - Joe hurries to the stereo, puts it on. Music to cover Gracie's "whoop . " He goes to the door, looks through the peep hole. Sees a LARGE MAN IN A SUIT. 
JOE Yes? 
"THIRD FBI MAN" (stopping his search) Oh please, John Boy. Not the shiv 
AGAIN - 
"FIRST FBI MAN" I'm just going to cut him a little - Slim's eyes bulge - 
"THIRD FBI MAN" You are not going to cut him! 
"FIRST FBI MAN" I sure as hell am! Slim's on the verge of bursting out when "Second FBI" enters: 
"SECOND FBI MAN" John Boy, this is not listed on the program. Come on, they're not here; let's ride. 
"FIRST FBI MAN" Can't I just - (cut him a little} 
"SECOND FBI MAN" No! No slice and dice! They head for the door. As he goes, "First FBI Man" (a.k.a. John Boy) runs his knife along the couch, spilling out its contents... .passes the tv set and stabs the tube... .runs his knife along the wall, making a vicious scary mark. And they vanish. We hear the door SLAM. The horizontal band through which Slim was looking widens - 
The cabinet door falls open, Slim and Gracie come out. Gracie's crying. Slim hugs her, says to Joe: 
SLIM Jesus, are you okay? 
JOE I guess. (feels his neck) I needed a shave, anyway. The phone rings. They look at it. It can't be who they think it is... it rings again. Joe goes to it. Hesitates. Answers: 
JOE Hello? 
MITCH'S VOICE This is Mitch Tyler, Joe. 
JOE Hello, yes, how are you? Joe points at phone: "It's him." He nods toward Gracie, indicating Slim should take her into the next room. Slim does. 
MITCH'S VOICE (calm, friendly) I assume Slim's called you. Joe thinks for a split second, then: 
JOE Of course. 
MITCH'S VOICE Will you give her a message? (off his silence) If she calls again, I mean. Slim and Gracie are in the next room, but Slim's looking through the door back at Joe. 
JOE I don't know. I'm on her side here, not yours. 
MITCH'S VOICE Her side? Come on, Joe, you're a smart person. Let me say two words, okay? "Lug nuts." You don't want to worry they're loose every time you get in your car. And how 'bout the windows to your apartment: are they still locked? A person could go crazy thinking about stuff like that. 
JOE Goodbye, Mitch. 
MITCH'S VOICE Tell her to call her friends. Joe hangs up. Slim comes back out. 
JOE Wow. Charming. 
SLIM He scare you? Joe shakes his head - more at Mitch than in answer to her question. 
SLIM {CONT.} I shouldn't be here - 
JOE Sure you should - 
SLIM I'm dangerous to know right now. 
JOE (calm, forceful) Slim. You can be here anytime. She nods. They both know what he's saying: if he's willing to take this kind of risk, he's either a very good friend (which he is) or he's still in love with her (which he is, also). 
JOE (CONT.) Oh. He said you should call your friends. 
SLIM At the restaurant? 
MOMENTS LATER. Slim on the phone, listening as the phone rings. And again, again. Joe watching her, concerned. Finally: 
GINNY'S VOICE Awright already! Orcal 
SLIM Hey. Gin. You okay? 
JUPITER It's a good gig. To claim I'm your father? What year were you born? 
SLIM You are my Dad, Jupiter. When Mom died, I wrote you, you didn't answer. I didn't have enough money to bury her, that was really fun. 
JUPITER Don't look at me, I didn't kill her. 
SLIM No, you had help. 
JUPITER That's a stupid thing to say. What do you want, money?. 
SLIM I thought you should meet your granddaughter. 
JUPITER (perfunctory, to Gracie) Hi. Gracie looks at him skeptically, nods. 
SLIM And yes, we need money. To survive. 
JUPITER Look sweetheart. From '68 to like '72, I had maybe 5 kids. Different women. It was like a joke to me. 
Â¢ SLIM It's like a joke to me too. 
JUPITER You're the third to show up here with a hand out. I give all of you the same thing. (taking it from his wallet) Six bucks. Enough for a sandwich. For you, it's' twelve, you can buy the kid a sandwich too. 
SLIM (stunned...} Well. Now I know. 
JUPITER Yeah. 
SLIM Used to be if I did something nasty, my temper got the better of me?, I'd wonder where the hell it came from. Thanks for clearing that up. 
JUPITER No problem. She goes, leaving the $12 on the table. He pockets it. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SAN FRANCISCO ALLEY. DAY. 
Slim stands behind Jupiter's building. In the shadows. Still carrying Gracie. It's only after we hear Gracie - 
GRACIE Don't cry, Mom. Please don't cry. - that we realize Slim is crying. 
GRACIE (CONT.) You have mtg. Beat. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. TRAIN STATION. SANTA BARBARA. NIGHT. 
Slim and Gracie climb off the train and are immediately shepherded away by TWO SWARTHY MEN in Hawaiian shirts - 
SLIM Wait. Wait. What're you...? Who're you...? 
GRACIE 
(WORRIED) Mommy? One of the Swarthy Men speaks to Slim, but in the flurry, we can't hear it. She looks relieved, turns to Gracie - - but before Slim can speak, their bags are thrown in the trunk of a car and they're pushed into the back seat - The car speeds off, whips into a left-hand turn - 
EXT. SANTA BARBARA. ANOTHER STREET. NIGHT. 
Now the car makes a right-hand turn, and a TRUCK pulls out, blocking traffic so no one can follow them - 
INT. CAR. NIGHT. 
Slim looks out the back, sees the Truck's maneuver. Turns to face forward again. Tries to meet the Driver's eyes. 
SLIM Hello? Where are we going? The Driver answers her in a Middle-Eastern language. Gracie looks alarmed. 
SLIM It's okay, Sweetheart, they're friends of Phil's. (I think.) 
INT. DOUBLE "A" RENT-A-CAR. BACK ROOM. DAY. 
Mustapha working at one desk, "Erin" at another. Gracie on the floor, coloring. Bored. Prompts a look from "Erin" - 
"ERIN" Look. I have to find the right place and get you admitted, okay? 
INT. DRAB HOUSE. NIGHT. 
15 people being served from a large pot. "Erin" and Gracie each get a good portion of something that looks quite unusual. 
"ERIN" Thank you. 
GRACIE Thank you. (looks at it, whispers) What j it? 
"ERIN." Food. 
INT. DOUBLE "A" RENT-A-CAR. DAY. 
"Erin" works at her desk. Gracie shoots paper basketballs- into the wastebasket.. stops as Mustapha enters. He gives "Erin" an open FedEx pack. 
MUSTAPHA FedEx is like underground railroad. "Erin" is stunned. She looks inside the package, finds another FedEx pack. Opens that. Inside it is a wrapped present and note. She reads: 
JUPITER'S VOICE "Dear Daughter - (CONT.) 
INT. JUPITER'S OFFICE. DAY. 
Jupiter's at his desk as the THREE "FBI MEN" are shown in. He says something gracious to them. For. a moment they don't respond. Then one of them speaks. 
Whatever he's saying produces a subtle but profound change on Jupiter's features. 
JUPITER'S VOICE (CONT.) Yesterday three men threatened to kill me if I helped you in any way. Fortunately for you, this aroused my interest. (CONT.) 
INT. DOUBLE "A" RENT-A-CAR. DAY. 
"Erin" opens the present and finds: Cash. Fifties. Probably a couple thousand dollars. She fights the impulse to cry. 
JUPITER'S VOICE (CONT.) I'm sending this via your former boss. If you get it and need more, leave word at my office. 
JUPITER" 
CUT TO: 
EXT./INT. SMALL PRETTY HOUSE. DAY. 
FLASHES: Arab Men carrying in a couch as "Erin" watches. "Erin" hanging sheets over the windows: makeshift curtains. "Erin" fixing Gracie's room. Small bed. Two new Teddy Bears. 
"ERIN" What do you think, you like this place? 
GRACIE 
(SUSPICIOUSLY) Why, are we moving again? 
"ERIN" No, we just - (got here) 
GRACIE Good. 'Cause I am sick and tired to death of movingi 
"ERIN" Me too. So here's the deal. Try to remember,. while we're here, to call me Mom or Erin, but not Slim, okay? 
GRACIE I never call you Slim. 
"ERIN" I know, but... 
GRACIE I don't think you are that slim. 
"ERIN" We can't afford to eat out every night. I can cook, Tootster. "Queen E." rolls her eyes as: 
BRAD Hi. (off her blank look) I'm Brad Zall, I just rented a car from you guys. "Erin" stares at him. An insane moment of sustained paranoia. Who is this guy,. really? What does he want? Finally she realizes a normal response is required. Kind of a 
TRICK QUESTION: 
"ERIN" Is the vehicle all right? 
BRAD Yeah, it's fine. I was just thinking that if you're not doing anything, maybe I could buy you - and the kid of course - 
"ERIN" Who are you?! Who sent you?! You want a date?! You are totally out of your mind if you think I'm gonna have even this conversation we're having right now! I'm not, okay?! We are not talking! Get it?! 
BRAD Yeah, I get it. And good luck with your psychotherapy. He walks away. She stares after him. Again "Queen E." is looking at her mother in astonishment. 
SUP 
"ERIN" 
(STILL AGGRESSIVE) What? You're thinking I over- reacted? Huh? Just a little? 
CUT TO: 
INT. "ERIN'S" TAURUS. DAY. 
"Erin" driving too fast. Her slight recklessness adds an undercurrent of anxiety to the scene. She's also eating doughnuts, sharing a box with her daughter. They pass a gas station. "Queen E." sees pay phones. 
"QUEEN ELIZABETH" You know Mom? I like the doughnuts and all, but the driving... 
"ERIN" Don't get on my case. 
"QUEEN ELIZABETH" Every Sunday, to drive for 55 hours? In exasperation, "Erin" gestures with both hands - taking them off the wheel. Nothing bad happens, but again her recklessness makes us nervous - 
"ERIN" It's not 55 - 
"QUEEN ELIZABETH" Just to reach some phone booth?! Hey can I call Daddy this time?! Please??? Please please please... "Erin" shakes her head. "Queen E." gives her a mournful look. 
"ERIN" Don't beg. You look like a dog. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. COUNTRY STORE. DAY. 
"Erin" is on the phone, "Queen E." at her side. 
"ERIN" Mrs. Tyler? It's Slim. 
MRS. TYLER'S VOICE Oh thank God. Listen. Mitch is planning some legal action, you're depriving him of his rights as a father, some nonsense like that: you better have Gracie call him. 
"ERIN" Oh that's good news - 
MRS. TYLER'S VOICE I thought you'd want to know - 
"ERIN" I do, thanks, I appreciate it. Listen: we have to keep it short again or he might trace it, so I better put her on - (hands phone to:) 
"QUEEN ELIZABETH" Hi Grandma! I have a new name! (as "Erin" frowns...) Yeah! You wanna hear it? "Erin" pushes down the lever, ending the call, mutters: 
"ERIN" Sorry, your Majesty. Remember: names're secret. "Queen E." nods. Puts on her mournful look... 
"ERIN" That is the most pitiful expression I've ever seen. 
CLOSE ON "QUEEN ELIZABETH" She listens, cradling the phone. "Erin" watches her daughter's face light up: 
"QUEEN ELIZABETH" Hi Daddy! We're having a great vacation! 
CUT TO: 
INT. "ERIN'S" HOUSE. KITCHEN. NIGHT. 
"Erin" and "Queen E." eating pasta. The sauce is unusual colors, grey and orange. "Queen E." pokes politely at her plate. "Erin" is understandably insecure about her cooking: 
"ERIN" What do you think, is it okay? It's okay, right? "Queen E." nods dubiously. 
"ERIN" (CONT.) No, it's not, it's horrible. 
"QUEEN ELIZABETH" It's not horrible, Mom. 
"ERIN" But it's not good, is it? Is it good? 
"QUEEN ELIZABETH" 
(INCREDULOUS) (Good??) Mom, you tasted it. 
"Erin" pushes her plate back. It's too much. in a second, silent tears are flooding down her face. This is not what "Queen E." wants to see. And she certainly doesn't want to reverse roles by giving comfort. Better just to pretend it's not happening. 
"QUEEN ELIZABETH" Know what I think? 
"ERIN" (tries to pull 
HERSELF TOGETHER) What's that? 
"QUEEN ELIZABETH" I think you miss Daddy. This comment is so wacko that it's almost touching. Almost. She feels compelled to be honest: 
"ERIN" Daddy yells at me, Toots. "Queen E." nods. Thinks... 
"QUEEN ELIZABETH" Well. You miss somebody. 
CUT TO: 
NOT ALL MEN ARE HEADS 
INT. SANTE FE AIRPORT. DAY. 
Joe gets off a plane with his carry-on luggage, goes to a bank of pay phones, examines the numbers on the phones... 
ANOTHER BANK OF PAY PHONES. MINUTES LATER. When one of these phones rings, he picks it up - 
JOE Sorry, my plane was delayed - 
EXT. ROADSIDE STAND. PAY PHONE. DAY. 
"Queen E." is hitting stones with a baseball bat as "Erin" talks on the phone: 
"ERIN" Rent a car, make sure you're not followed, drive to the Taos airport. 
JOE'S VOICE Another plane?? 
"ERIN" In Taos, go to Starbucks. Not the main one or the one by Hagen-Dazs. The one near the book store. 
INT. SANTA FE AIRPORT. DAY. 
Joe shakes his head, amused: 
JOE What is this, a treasure hunt? I'm gonna spend the whole weekend flying around? 
"ERIN'S" VOICE I'll call Starbucks in three hours. 
(REASSURING HIM:) Don't worry, you'll be here by four. Dialtone. He hangs up. 
EXT. DOUBLE "A" RENT-A-CAR. DAY. 
We watch from across the street as "Erin" hurries to her Taurus, gets in and drives away. 
EXT. PRE-SCHOOL. DAY. 
"Erin" in line for Pick-up. Betty the Pre-school Director comes up to "Erin" and says casually: 
BETTY Erin. I'm glad you're here. We can't find Queen Elizabeth - 
"ERIN" You can't find her??! 
BETTY So many kids're staying for these after-school things - She turns, distracted, as ANOTHER TEACHER calls - 
n "Erin" blinks... looks around frantically... OTHER KIDS in gym or dance gear, but no "Queen E."...and the knowledge of what's happened is hitting her...her eyes're dilating, breathing becoming frantic. Betty turns back as "Erin" mutters: 
"ERIN" I should've! ... I should've known!, he did it before! She rams the car in gear, rockets out of the pick-up line - Almost hits a TEACHER and 4 YEAR OLD KID - Slams the breaks, calls: 
"ERIN" I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I... I... Freaked out, frantic, she pulls to the side of the road, yanks up her brake, grabs her cell phone. Auto-dial #2. 
T.T.'S VOICE Double "A" Rent 
"ERIN" Did Queen Elizabeth call?! 
T.T.'S VOICE No, of course - (not) 
"ERIN" Anyone else?! 
T.T.'S VOICE Nobody called, Erin; are you - (okay?) "Erin" presses STOP, then Auto-dial #1, waits, looks around. Betty staring at her like she's crazy, walking toward her car - 
"ERIN'S" VOICE Hi. Leave a message. 
"ERIN" Gracie, are you there?! Is anyone there?! Please? Pick up! No one picks up. Silence. She beats the wheel in frustration... lowers her head. For one long second, she seems completely beaten... 
A KNOCK on her window - She looks up, sees Betty. Betty's talking, but it's as if "Erin" has gone crazy. For a moment there's no sound, and then the sound is there but unintelligible, and finally the words and sounds come together: 
BETTY .what I've been trying to tell you... "Erin" nodding now, beginning to grasp the words... 
BETTY (CONT.) At the end of dance class, the teacher lets them go hide, and for a minute no one could find her - "Erin" looks past Betty, sees "Queen E." in her tutu and leaps out of her car - 
"ERIN" Thank you, thank you, I... I'm sorry. I'll explain later, I... She rushes forward, wraps "Queen E." in a big, not quite appropriate hug. "Queen E." looks at her as if to say, "This is nice, Mom, but will you please tell me what gives?" 
CUT TO: 
EXT. RENT-A-CAR. NIGHT. 
From a distance, we watch "Erin" and "Queen E." trudge toward their Taurus. The end of the day; they're tired. 
CUT TO: 
INT. "ERIN'S" HOUSE. KITCHEN. MIGHT. 
Making meat loaf. "Erin" consults the cookbook, seems confused, puts meat, breadcrusts, eggs, sauces, onions, etc. in a bowl. "Queen E." mooshes them with her fingers - a disgusting tactile job which she adores. IMPROVISE DIALOG to make the scene utterly mundane, two "girls" having fun... The normalness of it makes us exceedingly nervous. 
INT. "ERIN'S" HOUSE. NIGHT. 
"Queen E." sleeping peacefully in her bed. 
"Erin" also sleeping peacefully. We OBSERVE her from a slight distance, to the left of the bed as we face it. Slowly the CAMERA BEGINS TO MOVE. . .down the bed...to the foot ...to the other side.. .back again on "Erin" sleeping peacefully... and the CAMERA RISES to show Mitch seated at her side. He seems calm and utterly content. It would be, hard to imagine a more terrifying attitude. 
INT. HER BEDROOM. DAWN. 
"Erin" wakes with a start, sits up, looks around - Everything's normal. Peaceful. No Mitch. "Erin" shakes her head, as if clearing away a dream. As she looks again around the room, her nostrils flare slightly. . .as if she smells him. She rubs her nose. Touches her wrist, and we notice something she's worn the whole time she's been Erin: a colorful elastic bracelet, probably a Swatch. She gets out of bed and looks out the window - Cold morning - She goes toward the hall... 
"QUEEN ELIZABETH" Mom, are you sure...?! Quite sure, thank you. "Erin" guns the accelerator. Robbie's FACE... driving, confident, full of blood lust, and then his expression changes. Eyes widen. He realizes - shit! too late!! - that the bridge is way too narrow for - "Erin" Is car slides through, scraping one side The Suburban crashes into the bridge, careens into the water - 
"Queen E." looks back through the rear view mirror... looks at her mother ...back and forth... 
"QUEEN ELIZABETH" That was dangerous. 
INT. CAR. MORNING 
Different country road. Parked ahead is a `78 Oldsmobile. "Erin" pulls in behind it. They get out of the Taurus. Using her keys, "Erin" unlocks the trunk of the Olds. Two large suitcases inside. "Erin" throws their small suitcase in on top. "Erin" reaches up under the driver's seat and pulls out a wallet. Checks the contents: cash, credit cards. "Queen E." pulls a red wig out of the glove compartment. 
INT. OLDSMOBILE. MORNING. 
They're on a lightly travelled two-lane highway. "Erin" (now a redhead) looks in her rear-view mirror: no cars. 
"ERIN" Okay, Toots. We can talk. "Queen E." stares at her mutely. 
"ERIN" {CONT.} Want me to tell you what happened? "Queen E." blinks twice, shakes her head. 
"ERIN" {CONT.} Fair enough. One thing, though: Erin's over. 
"QUEEN ELIZABETH" (Too bad.} I liked Erin. Slim nods sadly: she liked Erin too. 
SLIM You're not the Queen of England anymore either. Gracie nods fatalistically, stares out the window. Flat voice: 
GRACIE I'm hungry. 
CUT TO: 
INT. DINER. DAY. 
Gracie eating voraciously. Slim has no appetite. Their WAITRESS comes over, notices Slim's not eating - 
WAITRESS Everything okay here? 
SLIM 
(NODS) Thanks. 
WAITRESS 
(TO GRACIE) Hey there, cutie, what's your name? Gracie looks up at her for a while. 
GRACIE I'm working on that one. The waitress does a double-take and leaves. To Slim: 
GRACIE {CONT.) Maybe something normal this time. Ann or Mary or... (sees Slim is distracted) Mom? 
SLIM I'm thinking. Beat. 
GRACIE (Yeah,) I can hear it. 
CUT. TO: 
EXT. COURTHOUSE. DAY. 
Slim parks. As she starts to get out, she says to Gracie: 
SLIM Anybody talks to you, hit the horn. 
INT. COURTHOUSE. DAY. 
Slim in line at a COUNTY RECORDER'S desk. The person in front of her leaves, she steps up: 
SLIM I need the best lawyer in town. 
SLIM'S VOICE Oh yeah? How 'bout Horace? Ginny glances at one of her kids, evidently Horace's child. 
GINNY Okay, this is the second most - 
SLIM'S VOICE Rent a car, drive to Denver, then fly to Reno. 
GINNY You're out of your mind. 
I 
SLIM'S VOICE (as though flattered) You noticed. Dialtone. We watch from a distance as Ginny shakes her head in disbelief, mutters to her kids. As they trudge off, the CAMERA FOLLOWS. 
INT. AIRPORT. RENTAL CAR COUNTER. DAY. 
From the same distance: Ginny and kids approach the counter. 
INT. AIRPORT PARKING GARAGE. RENT-A-CAR AREA. DAY. 
Ginny loading luggage into the back as her kids climb in. As Ginny slams the trunk, SOMEONE'S RIGHT THERE - Slim. Ginny blinks, recognizes her, hugs her: 
GINNY What're you... (doing here?) I thought we were... (driving to Reno) 
SLIM I had to make sure you weren't followed. 
GINNY (re Slim's hair) I like it. (not so sure) Maybe. 
(SEES GRACIE) Hey, Graceland. Gracie slips out from behind Slim, goes and hugs Ginny as Slim holds up a wallet: 
SLIM There's a credit card and cash. It's on me, but make no calls home, or to Phil. Think of it as a vacation till the Orca reopens. Toots? 
This to Gracie, who started to climb into the car. Gracie looks at Slim and again tries to climb in - she wants }}g part of saying goodbye - but Slim pulls her back into a hug. Slim holds her for as long as Gracie can possibly tolerate. When Slim is done, Gracie climbs into the car with Ginny's kids. Slim has tears in her eyes. 
SLIM Take care of her, okay? Extra ice- cream and... and if you need to reach me... (hands her a cell phone) Just don't call your friends. 
GINNY Oh great. I'll call strangers. 
SLIM In an emergency, I'm #1 on the auto- dialer. Or I'll call you. Any calls between us must run is seconds or less. Cake? 
GINNY 
PIE - 
SLIM Ass. (re the vacation) Enjoy it, huh? 
GINNY How long? 
SLIM The custody hearing's end of next month. That's my deadline. 
GINNY Deadline for what? Slim looks at her... 
CUT TO: 
WE'RE SO CLOSE WE CAN'T TELL WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT. CAMERA 
SLOWLY PULLS BACK: EYES ...SLIM'S EYES. Intense, focussed. 
THE KNOWLEDGE 
MAN'S VOICE You ready? She nods. CAMERA CONTINUES BACK, we see more of her face. 
MAN'S VOICE Sure? Another nod. Perspiration streaming from her pores, running down her face. And a look we haven't seen before. 
MAN'S VOICE Can you lose? She shakes her head. 
JUPITER How's that black guy I .set you up with? 
SLIM Good. 
JUPITER Did he teach you how to think? It's not the question she expected; it's more interesting and complicated. 
SLIM .I hope so. (before he can speak) The English guy is good too. 
(ALL BUSINESS) But that's not why I'm here. I need a woman who looks like me. Someone who can handle herself: an off-duty cop or something. (hands him photo) Five four, one ten. Hair like this but cut higher, over the ear - (hands him key) Miko hotel, room 509, 8 o'clock. 
JUPITER Tonic ? That's awful short notice; I don't know if I can - 
SLIM What? I thought Jupiter was like all-powerful, king of the Gods? Oh yeah. One more thing. At some point.. .not right now 'cause it'd be phony ...I need you to acknowledge that I'm your kid. She walks away. He stares after her. Hint of a smile comes to his face. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ELECTRONICS STORE. DAY. 
Slim is signing the credit card slip as the CLERK puts the merchandise in a distinctive red bag - 
SLIM You sure this'll work? 
CLERK You bet your life. 
SLIM Thanks, I will. She leaves, taking out her cell phone. FOLLOW HER as she goes: 
EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREET. DAY. 
She walks up the street, punches in a number... 
BUTLER'S VOICE Tyler residence. 
SLIM Yes. Tony. Could you please tell Mrs. Tyler that I'll call her around f our this afternoon. 
BUTLER'S VOICE Of course, Miss Slim. My pleasure. Slim hangs up, goes into a. bagel shop. 
INT.. BAGEL PLACE. LATER. 
Slim sits at a table with a cup of coffee. A short guy, 28, built like a fireplug, dressed in sweater and jeans and wool cap, enters, walks to her, and says in an English accent: 
ALEX Today, hon, you graduate. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. DOWNTOWN L.A. STREET. DAY. 
Alex and Slim are across the street from a strip joint. 
SLIM It's closed? 
ALEX Till six, eh? 
SLIM And I'd guess whoever owns it isn't a very nice person. 
ALEX That's a safe one. Slim starts walking toward the shop. As they go: 
SLIM Why here? 
ALEX You've got soft hands, you've worked hard. The tricky part now is nerves. They reach the entryway; Slim takes out her tools. 
SLIM People on the street? 
ALEX Yeah. And you have to go in when his alarm's turned off - 
TOVA And tonight? 
SLIM Go around the corner, eat at Guido's. 
TOVA I'll be followed? 
SLIM Green trenchcoat. Tova nods and Slim takes off her own wig. Short dark hair. 
SLIM (CONT.) Wish me luck, huh? 
TOVA Good luck. 
SLIM Luck has nothing to do with it. Tova smiles. 
INT. HOTEL. HALL. NIGHT. 
Slim waiting as the Service Elevator arrives. Gets in. 
EXT. HOTEL. REAR ENTRANCE. NIGHT. 
Slim going out the door, down the alley... 
INT. AIRPORT. NIGHT. 
Slim getting on the plane to Los Angeles. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SAN PEDRO STREET. NIGHT. 
Slim parks, looks across at a warehouse converted into lofts. 
BATTLE OF THE She takes a duffle from the back seat. Steps into the shadows, stares at the warehouse: Brick building, modern door and light fixtures. 
SEXES She looks both ways: The street's dark. Deserted. She hoists her duffle, takes a deep breath. And crosses the street. Goes up the stairs to the stoop. Looks at the alarm panel on the door: green. Crouches, starts to work on the lock. 
INT. WAREHOUSE/LOFT. SLEEPING AREA. NIGHT. 
Mitch in bed, sleeping. Peaceful. A SOUND, Off. He stirs slightly. 
ANOTHER SOUND. He sits up. Frowning... dazed. Cocks his head. Listens... The SILENCE seems to have texture. He gets up. 
We glimpse: a beautiful brick warehouse converted inside into an open, loft-like space filled with bird'seye maple, metal beams, etc. Modern, glistening, expensive. He walks around the place in the dark. In his boxer shorts and t-shirt. He looks vulnerable... SLIM'S POV... From one corner. Observing him. She has become the stalker. HER EYES, watching... He decides everything's okay and goes back to the semi partitioned sleeping area... He gets back into bed - next to a YOUNG BLOND WOMAN, 22. She turns over, mutters something, goes back to sleep. He lies there, eyes open. Stays very still. Listening. 
JARRING CUT TO: 
INT. SAME WAREHOUSE. MORNING. 
Bright light. Mitch in his bathrobe making coffee. The Young Blond Woman comes out, fully dressed... 
MITCH Coffee? 
YOUNG BLOND I gotta get home, change for work. He nods, gives her a perfunctory kiss: 
MITCH I'll call you. She stares at him a second. 
YOUNG BLOND You want my number? 
MITCH Sure. She sees how "eager" he is to talk to her again. Irritated, she scribbles the number quickly, hands.it to him - 
MITCH Thanks for everything. 
For the sex, in other words. She gives it right back to him: 
EXT. STREET. NIGHT. 
Mitch walks down the street. Up the steps, punches in his alarm code. 
INT. MITCH'S PLACE. NIGHT. 
Mitch enters, closes and locks the door. Turns on the light. He walks back to the rear of the space, hangs up his coat. Goes into the bedroom area, takes off his jacket. The lights go out. Mitch freezes, shadow on shadow, a silhouette in the darkness. He looks out the window, sees: The neighboring buildings still have light and power. He cocks his head, listening. Silence. Walks to the door of the bedroom area. Waits. Take two more steps - 
SLIM'S VOICE It's me. He nods slowly. 
MITCH Yeah. (I thought so.) 
He moves quietly to the bed... to the night table where Slim found the pistol. Covers this by talking: 
MITCH {CONT.} This morning too? 
SLIM'S VOICE You always did forget to turn off the coffee. He rummages in the drawer. We hear the RUSTLE of the letters Slim put there. He fails to find the gun. Gives up trying to be quiet, tosses papers onto the floor - 
SLIM'S VOICE {CONT.} I found it, Mitch. His hand leaves the drawer. He thinks. Picks up the phone, listens. Dead. Looks around... can't see her... Goes back to the chair where he hung his sports coat and fishes out his cell phone. We see the GLOW of its dial. He punches 911 and pressed SEND. The dial goes dark for two seconds, then blinks back on. He stares at it. Tries again. 911, SEND. Again it goes dead. 
SLIM'S VOICE It's a machine. Knocks out cell phones. He throws the cell phone onto the bed. Walks out of the bedroom area. Looks around the vast space. Spooky. Slanting light and dense shadow. He doesn't see her. 
Walks toward his desk. 
SLIM'S VOICE I found that gun too. He stops. Doesn't know where to go. or what to do. 
SLIM'S VOICE Scared? 
MITCH 
(FUCK YOU) Of what? 
SLIM'S VOICE Now is when you decide, Mitch. (off his silence) Whether you're a coward. If you are, you can run. I won't stop you. 
MITCH (meaning the match is unfair:) You have my guns. 
SLIM'S VOICE Threw 'em away. 
MITCH Then someone's here with you. 
SLIM'S VOICE No. 
MITCH 
(INCREDULOUS) You're alone? 
SLIM'S VOICE Why not? 
MITCH 'Cause it'd be stupid. Silence is her answer. 
MITCH (CONT.) You're sayin' this is man to man? 
SLIM'S VOICE Woman, Mitch. 
MITCH That's what I meant: man against woman - you sure that's fair? The lights go back on. Slowly Slim comes out from hiding... 
SLIM Fair to whom? As he realizes her meaning, she moves into the open area between two couches. She has no weapon. She's barefoot, in her sweats, feet spread for balance, arms just slightly raised. Compared to him: she's tiny. He moves toward her. 
SLIM This is what you wanted, right? What you were going to San Francisco for: the chance to get me alone? He lunges for her; she slides to the side and he misses. He begins to stalk her. And as he stalks, she moves backward, slowly and gracefully, in the way she was practicing. 
MITCH I don't understand, Slim. How does this work for you? She ignores his words. Watches his eyes and his chest. Wants to know where he's going to attack. 
MITCH (CONT.) I mean: this is carefully thought out, right? She does not respond. He throws three punches. None of them hits her. He's unfazed, keeps stalking... 
SLIM 
YEAH - 
GINNY'S VOICE It worked?! 
SLIM Listen to me! I did it, but I can't do it! I can't kill him! Behind Slim, out of focus: movement, a soft blur... 
GINNY'S VOICE (CONT.) 
(URGENTLY) Slim. He'll come after you - 
SLIM I know - 
GINNY'S VOICE (CONT.) He'll come after Gracie - 
An indistinct shape, something rising over her head... 
SLIM I know all that! I have to, but I can't! I'm not a killer! I'm not him! Mitch. Crazed and bloody face. In his hand: the wooden lamp. She senses something, turns her head slightly to one side - - so the lamp does not land quite flush on her skull. Still sends her crashing to the floor. Now she does not move. He stands over her. Looks insane: bloody, dazed, beaten: but triumphant. 
GINNY'S VOICE Hello? Slim? You there? The lamp moving in his hand. He's rotating it. A simple menacing image... . and we realize: he' s aoinq to hit her again. 
GINNY'S VOICE {CONT.} Should I call the cops?! Answer me?! He's distracted by Ginny's voice. Picks up the phone. 
MITCH Listen to me, bitch. Ginny's silent. 
MITCH (CONT.) if you value your children, don' t call anybody. It's over, okay? It's all over. He throws the phone on the couch and moves back toward Slim, lamp clenched tight in his fist. 
SMASH IN CLOSE ON HER FACE. CLOSER STILL. We're almost inside her head as we hear: 
INSTRUCTOR'S VOICE Hold onto my voice... 
Is that the hint of a smile on her face? 
INSTRUCTOR'S VOICE (CONT.) You're ready... Mitch sees the slight smile, can't believe it - Rage. He pulls his foot back to kick her - Her eyes are open, just a slit - His foot swinging forward... As it reaches her, she grabs it, yanks it - He's pulled off his feet, crashing down on top of her - But she's already rolling, out from under him... and up - Coming to her feet - He starts to rise, all fours, then into a crouch and ug... SLOW MOTION. She's ready. Her face alert. Center of gravity low. Arm low,.fist low... As her motion unfurls: Boxers say that an uppercut, perfectly executed, is the most difficult, powerful, and beautiful of punches. Indeed: when an uppercut starts low for maximum center-of- gravity and hits the opponent flush on the point of the chin - as Slim's does here - it delivers a devastating message to the central nervous system, short-circuiting it completely. Mitch flies backward... There's a table behind him. His head cracks on the table. His neck snaps. He lands on the floor: twisted, broken. Slim stares at him. There's no way a living man could assume the position now occupied by her former husband. 
She stares in disbelief. Though she knows the answer, she feels his carotid artery. Her face registers what she feels. Horror, relief. She walks slowly to her cell phone, picks it up. Listens: no one there. She presses redial, waits... 
GINNY'S VOICE (in a panic) H o?d 
SLIM Hi. 
GINNY'S VOICE Oh thank God you're alive. 
SLIM Gin, he's ...he hit his...he's not breathing. 
GINNY'S VOICE oh. 
SLIM Yeah. 
GINNY'S VOICE Well: I called the cops, they're on their way. Slim nods. 
GINNY'S VOICE Slim... can you hear me?, this is important. Beat. 
SLIM Okay. As Ginny talks, Slim puts the cell-phone blocker into the duffle and carries the duffle to the rear of the building. 
GINNY'S VOICE You're not him, okay? You're not him, and you never will be. 
SLIM See you soon. She drops the cell phone out the bedroom window into the water. Then the duffle. They both sink. 
EXT. BROWNSTONE. 
She comes out, sits on the steps. A siren is audible. Cop cars speed down the street, screech to a stop. TWO COPS LEAP OUT OF THE CAR, run toward her.

FADE IN: 
1   EXT. BEACH HOUSE - MONTECITO, CALIFORNIA - DAY                1 A late afternoon sky, a red tile roof and the Santa Barbara coast line frame this party of old friends. A trio plays Brazilian music as guests carry drinks and nibble on dessert. 
2   CLOSE - ON A FOURSOME OF FRIENDS                              2 The Couple who live in this house, SALLY AND TED, drink champagne as they chat with their closest friends, JANE AND JAKE. 
JANE is mid-fifties and has embraced that fact. She knows 50 is not the new 40 and because of that, she is still described by all who know her as beautiful. Everything about this woman's appearance screams "solid." 
The years have been good to JAKE. He's never lost his looks, his killer smile, or his ability to charm. He lifts his glass of champagne. JAKE Happy happy happy... 
JANE (reminding him) -- Anniversary. 
Jake pauses, wryly turns to Jane, making her smile. 
JAKE Some things never change. 
SALLY Thank God. 
JANE I thought maybe you were drifting. 
TED He was pausing. 
JAKE Exactly.... (sighs, raising his glass) Happy... Anniversary. You two have led an extraordinarily blessed life. (MORE) JAKE(cont'd) As long as I've known you both, you've always managed to somehow do everything entirely right. 
JANE -- That's so true. 
JAKE But, honestly, how can it be thirty years!?!   When did we do that trip to Spain? (looks to Jane) It was for both of our what..? 
JANE -- Fifteenth anniversaries. 
JAKE God, that was a great trip... 
The Two Women exchange a quick look when a tall, ADORABLE 21 YEAR OLD BOY joins the group, holding a bottle of beer. This is OLIVER, Sally and Ted's son. All four light up as Oliver puts his arm around his Mom. 
JANE Ollie, how was graduation? 
OLIVER It was fantastic. I can't believe I'm not in school anymore. When's Luke's graduation? 
JAKE Next week. 
JANE (correcting him) It's in three days! 
JAKE Sorry!   I mean this week. 
TED Are the girls going? 
JANE They can't wait. Jane glances across the party and sees AGNESS, A FREE SPIRITED PRETTY WOMAN in her thirties, wearing a sarong over a bathing suit and walking directly toward them. She carries a slice of cake. Jane becomes instantly distracted and uncomfortable. 
OLIVER How long is Luke home before he has to go back for work? 
JANE -- Only a week... SALLY Aw, that's it? JANE I know, I hate it. Well... (Agness joins the group, standing next to Jake) Congrats again... (puts down her champagne) Great party... 
OLIVER You're leaving? 
The SUV pulls to a stop, Jane gets out. Gabby starts pulling cartons out of her trunk to make room for her clothes. JANE Gabby, you're leaving now? I thought you were going in the morning? 
GABBY I know but my friends are all there and they wanted me to come tonight. 
JANE But honey, it's gonna get dark soon. You can't see out the back window. It's Saturday night. People will be on the road drinking... 
LAUREN Mom, she'll be there in a couple of hours, she'll be fine. 
GABBY Okay, I'm leaving this stuff here. I'll be back for it in a few days. 
JANE Want me to drive it down in the morning? (Gabby's BLACKBERRY BUZZES, she laughs, thumbs flying) I could be there by lunch. We could go to that big Bed, Bath, and Beyond, buy kitchen stuff... Gabby, can you look up from that thing?? 
GABBY (looking up) I got it covered, Ma. (to Harley) Hey gangsta, help me carry these... 
HARLEY (exhausted) Yep.... 
Gabby and Harley CARRY THE BOXES back into the house.   Jane seems worried as she watches them. 
LAUREN Mom, are you afraid to sleep in the house alone? 
JANE What are you....? No! (Lauren looks doubtful) -- I'm not! One of you is always moving out... (Gabby re-joins) But I am wondering who I'm gonna watch The Hills with? 
GABBY (huge hug) Mamacita... I'm gonna miss you. 
Jane hugs her back, but is aware of not hugging too hard. Harley joins the group. GABBY Omigod. L.A.! Okay. I'm doing this. (walks to her car) Mom, you don't happen to know where Dad is, do you? I tried calling him to say goodbye... 
JANE He was at Sally and Ted's. 
HARLEY He was? How was that? You and them at the same -- (Jane turns to him) -- not that it's in any way, any of my... was just... JANE -- It was.... (notices both girls wait for her answer) -- whatever. It was fine. 
GABBY Was her lunatic child there? 
JANE (laughs) Not this time. Gabby, call me when you get there. Do NOT forget. (MORE) JANE(cont'd) (Gabby texts, deep in convo ) Gabby! GABBY I will. I'll call you! LAUREN Knock `em dead, little one. 
HARLEY And call us when you get there, too. And no texting and driving. 
Jane loves that Harley said that. Gabby gets in her car and starts off. 
HARLEY (puts his arm around Jane's shoulder) They grow up so friggin' fast. I hate it. Gabby pulls out of the driveway and out of sight. LAUREN Maybe you should get a dog. 
JANE Oh my God.     Goodbye you two.   Love you. 
HARLEY (heading for their car and getting into the passenger seat) Love you boss! 
As Lauren and Harley drive off,    Jane turns and looks at her suddenly very empty nest. 
4   INT. JANE'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS                                    4 A Woman's house. Books and art collected over years. Interesting, unexpected pieces of furniture. Jane kicks off her heels, now feeling short and alone. Deep breath! 
5   INT. KITCHEN                                                      5 Cramped, but clearly a cook's kitchen.      The Kids have left a few glasses and plates on the island. 
Jane gathers them and as she rinses them at the sink, she suddenly and surprisingly feels very alone. She pauses, allows herself the moment, then forces herself to snap out of it. 
7   INT. THE BAKERY - MONTECITO - DAY                             7 This is Jane's other home. A large, bright, bustling BAKERY/RESTAURANT. The bakery counter could rival any in Paris. Last year, The New York Times rated Jane's pain au chocolat the best in the United States. A line waits to get in. 
A very relaxed Jane is behind the busy counter, easily moving between her young staff. The atmosphere is efficient and friendly. 
Jane adjusts a few signs on the counter, then reaches inside the display case, pulling out a tray of muffins topped with powdered sugar. She carries the tray to the open pass- through to the BUSY KITCHEN and calls to the head Baker. 
JANE Reynaldo... (nods to the muffins) 
ADAM And you don't think in the future you might want a his? 
JANE Oh, God, we're talking code about my life, right? 
ADAM (laughs) No, no, didn't mean to be. 
JANE The truth is, in my current bathroom, I have two sinks and sometimes the other sink makes me feel bad. 
ADAM One sink. Not a problem. Can we schedule a meeting for next week? Does Tuesday work for you? JANE Tuesday's great. Eight-thirty too early? At the house? 
ADAM I'll be there. 
9   INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - FOLLOWING                              9 Way too chic for a dentist's office. Jane sits nervously in a chair in a well styled, well upholstered examination room. The door opens quickly and a handsome, crisp looking DOCTOR ENTERS. 
JANE Hi. 
DOCTOR Hi. I'm Dr. Moss. 
JANE (shaking his hand) Hi. Jane Adler. So, I just wanted to start with... and please don't take this the wrong way but I'm the type of person who kind of makes fun of people who get plastic surgery. 
DR. MOSS I understand. 
JANE You do? Good, because, you know, some women can look a little fake and plasticky. And in my opinion -- worse. 
DR. MOSS I agree. 
JANE Oh, that's good, so, well, as against the whole thing as I am, I do have a problem that's been bugging me. My left eyelid is really saggy. I find I'm sometimes holding it up when I'm watching TV or reading and I was wondering if that's something you could fix. 
DR. MOSS (looking at her closely) It's resting on your eye lashes. JANE Is it? 
DR. MOSS (measures her lids with a very tiny ruler) Actually you have the same amount of excess skin on both sides. 
JANE I do? Well, I'm only interested in fixing one eye. DR. MOSS Jane, what you need to fix this is a brow lift. 
JANE A brow lift? Wh-what is that exactly? 
DR. MOSS We surgically cut at your hair line. Incision goes right across here. (demonstrates on himself by indicating a line drawn like a headband) Then we just lift the skin up a little tighter across the skull. (Jane nods, already hating this) We staple it back in place right above your ears. Recovery isn't all that bad but you could be fairly numb and you'll probably have a headache that lasts anywhere from say 3 to 6 months. 
10   INT. ELEVATOR DOORS OPENING                               10 Jane flies into the elevator, out of breath and a little nauseous. She taps on the Lobby button.   The elevator moves down. PING. The DOORS OPEN and Jane looks into an empty hallway, facing a SIGN that reads, Santa Barbara Fertility Center. Helping Couples Become Parents. 
Jane hears someone is about to get on the elevator, steps back toward the corner. A messy looking 5 YEAR OLD BOY dashes in. Jane recognizes him. She looks up and Jake and his wife, Agness, in oversized dark shades and a long black dress (very Angelina Jolie) get on the elevator, obviously mid-argument. 
Agness' mood seems very dark today. They instantly shut up when they realize Jane is in the elevator. 
AGNESS Jane! 
JANE -- Hey.. JAKE Hiii. 
JANE Hello. 
AGNESS (pushing the Lobby button, mumbles) -- Perfect. 
PEDRO Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake. Jake. 
JAKE Hold on Pedro, I'm talking to someone. 
Pedro sits on the floor, crashing into the back wall of the elevator. 
AGNESS Pedro, up! Now!! (she snaps) 
DIANE Okay. I don't know if this is true, but I read on line about this woman who hadn't done it in so long her vagina closed up. 
JANE What!!!    Get out of here. 
All the Women SCREAM. 
DIANE I swear to God. It grew back together. 
JOANNE Wait. Was it ever one piece? 
DIANE All I know is, she had to have a vaginaplasty. 
TRISHA Ouch!!!! JANE Oh my Goddddddd. 
Jane flops over on the table, laughing, resting her head. JANE (lifts her head, then talks as if she's in the doctor's office) "Dr. Moss, Hi. I have a little situation that needs fixing...." 
TRISHA Bubbee, you want to fix your situation? Just date someone. Seriously. Anyone. 
As Jane takes that in, we: CUT TO: 
16    EXT. THE PARK REGENT HOTEL - NYC - DAY                        16 CAMERA BOOMS DOWN ON Park Avenue to find Jane, the Girls and Harley, just out of a Cab. The Bellman is taking their luggage as the Girls spot their brother, LUKE, heading toward them. 
Lauren and Gabby run to Luke, hug him, commenting on his hair, his shoes, his jeans, his tan. Jane lights up when she sees her son, hugs him incredibly hard, kisses his cheek, then another tight squeeze. 
JANE Love when we're all in the same time zone. 
A17   INT. THE PARK REGENT LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER                A17 They all cross THROUGH THE LOBBY toward the RECEPTION DESK. HARLEY So, what's up Luke?      Did you decide to have the party? 
LUKE Oh, yeah.    Big time. JANE What party? 
LUKE Are you guys gonna sleep over? 
LAUREN If you give us your bed and change the sheets. 
They arrive at THE RECEPTION DESK. 
JANE You're having a party? When? (to Reception Clerk) Hi. Adler. Two rooms...hopefully next to each other. 
RECEPTION CLERK I have an Adler, J. in a Superior Suite, Park Avenue view. Oh, I'm sorry, here it is. Adler J -- two Standard Doubles. Sorry about that. 
JANE Yeah, we're not the ones in the Superior Suite. Have the other Adlers checked in yet? Just wondering. 
RECEPTION CLERK No, they haven't, ma'am. Not yet. Now I just need a credit card and your signature. 
As Jane takes out her credit card... 
LUKE -- Mom, is it okay if the girls come with me now and help me set up? 
HARLEY And by girls he means the three of us. 
JANE Wait. Hold on. Set up what? I have reservations for all of us for dinner. That's not happening now? 
LUKE I don't know. Me and my friends are having this huge thing at our apartment and the girls said they'd help us set up.. (sees her disappointment) We're going to be together all day tomorrow. 
GABBY -- Mom, it's his last night before graduation. 
JANE Okay, okay.    Do you want me to help or... 
LUKE (super sweetly) -- Love your credit card.... 
JAKE I know but I always wondered so... 
JANE Little jealous? 
JAKE Yes. 
JANE The man's married now. 
JAKE I don't care. How long? 
JANE Eight months. 
JAKE (surprised) Long.... 
JANE Not long. 
A23   LATER                                                      A23 The bar is now crowded. Jane and Jake are finally eating but still drinking. Jake is telling Jane a long story and she can't stop laughing. 
23    OMIT                                                        23 
24    BRANDY TIME                                                 24 A DJ spins for the after dinner crowd. Couples dance on the dance floor. Jane and Jake both react to the song. 
JAKE This song reminds me of your birthday party... the one in our old house... JANE -- Oh, yeah. That was such a fun night. JAKE So fun. You wore that white halter dress.... JANE (remembering) Oh, yeahhhh.... (remembering it all, looks at Jake with a longing for her own past...) JAKE Want to dance? JANE -- No...! 
25   THE DANCE FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER                          25 Jake and Jane are dancing...it's familiar yet with the blush of the new. Something's going on here. Jake starts singing. Jane joins in. This is by far, the loosest we've seen her. Of course, it helps that she's drunk. They dance around one another without inhibition. A mating dance.... 
JANE (astonished, laughing) You're married to someone else...! 
JAKE Tell me about it! 
They both laugh then Jake pulls Jane close. JANE (sexy....) Hey.... I know you. 
JAKE (looking deeply into her) And I know you.... 
CUT TO: 
26   INT. JAKE'S SUITE - LATER                                    26 They're in bed and they've done it. They're not even entirely undressed. They're spent, sweaty, breathing heavily. Jake cups his hand on Jane's vagina, gives it a solid pat and hold. 
JAKE Home sweet home. 
JANE Oh......God......... 
Jane covers her face. 
JAKE That was one crazy ride...thought we were going to break the bed. 
JANE (not looking good) -- I'm having an out of body experience. 
JAKE Totally. You're so great, Janey. I forgot how great. Holy shit. 
JANE Please shut up.    I'm so dizzy. 
JAKE And the pilates are payin' off by the way. 
Jane moans, OPENS THE NIGHT TABLE DRAWER, leans over and throws up into it. 
JAKE Oh no! 
Jane woozily sits up on her side of the bed, her back to Jake. Jake looks over at her. JAKE You okay? 
JAKE -- Janey, I take my hat off to you. 
JANE Okay, Jake. Thank you. Out of nowhere, sudden appreciation. But thank you. Really. 
JAKE Not totally out of nowhere, Jane...if you know what I mean. 
JANE (quickly) Which I don't...but... 
LAUREN What's he...? 
JANE -- Have no idea. Let's move on, shall we? Jane holds up her droopy left eye. 
GABBY I'd like to say something too. For real. No offense to the lovely Agness or her charming offspring... (the Kids stifle laughs) 
JAKE -- Not nice. 
Harley stops laughing. 
GABBY I know. I'm sorry. But I just want to say I really loved today, just being with the original five... (Luke nods in agreement) -- plus Harley, but he's like one of us. I don't think we've ever done this before... Had a meal together. And hung out like this... 
LAUREN You mean other than the first 13 years of your life. 
LUKE I know what's she saying. It's been awesome....just for a whole day to be just... us. 
They all reflect on that one. 
31   INT. THE PARK REGENT LOBBY - LATER                          31 The Adlers are at the Reception Desk. Jane and Jake are next to each other, signing their credit card receipts, the Kids chat behind them. 
JAKE (to Jane) Something feels right in the universe again, doesn't it? 
Jane looks at him but doesn't answer.    She turns to the Kids. 
JANE So who's coming home when?   No one's told me the details. 
Jake's CELL RINGS. Jane half listens to his conversation. 
JAKE (into cell) Hey. (turns away) How's Pedro feeling? 
Distracted, Jane focuses on Lauren. 
LAUREN (responding to "Pedro") Okay, we're gonna help pack Luke up, the three of us leave day after tomorrow and Luke's home the end of the week. 
JAKE (rejoins, finishing his call) -- I will. Call you when I land. (slips cell away, not missing a beat) Janey, what flight are you on? 
JANE I'm on the uh, the four o'clock. JAKE Ah, too bad. I'm on the five o'clock. 
LUKE That's nuts, why don't you try to get on the same flight? 
JAKE Yeah, I could try. 
JANE It's been...great, but let's not ... push it. 
LAUREN He was just trying to be nice. 
JANE I know. Okay, I've got to hit the road, guys. (MORE) JANE(cont'd) (kisses each kid as they line up) Thanks for staying. So proud of you. Be good. Call me if you need me. (she arrives at Jake, pauses, speechless) 
JAKE (kisses her cheek) It was really fun. 
JANE (painfully) It was. 
35   EXT. HOUSE - LATER                                         35 Blue prints are spread on a garden table.   Adam is drawing as Jane watches. ADAM -- So if we move this wall back a bit, that can bring the arch forward, which is where you really want it, right? JANE Yes, I'd love that. 
ADAM (sketching) Thought so. 
JANE I have an idea... what if we move my bedroom like six or eight feet so I can get more of the morning light? (MORE) JANE(cont'd) (sees Adam hesitate) Not possible? 
ADAM -- Yes, but you'll wake up in the morning, open your bedroom door and fall 12 feet into your kitchen. 
JANE Ahhh! Forgot it was all open up there! 
ADAM But I get where you're headed. Let me see what I can do... This property is so great... Have you lived here a long time? 
JANE About ten years. I bought this place right after my divorce but it's taken me until now to be able to finally do this.... Jane and Adam are distracted when a Porsche noisily pulls up and Jake gets out wearing a suit and a chipper attitude. 
JAKE Good morning! (to Jane) Am I interrupting...? 
JANE (thrown that   he's here) Hi. No, well, we   were just about done. Adam, this   is my ex-husband, Jake. Jake, this   is Adam Schaeffer, my architect. 
JAKE Hi. 
ADAM (they shake hands) Good to meet you. 
JAKE (re: plans) Can I take a look?   Do you mind? 
Adam looks to Jane for approval but too late, Jake's already looking. 
JANE Everything's not 100% worked out yet... 
JAKE Wow. You're finally getting the kitchen you always wanted... JANE Yeah... 
JAKE Huge bedroom. JANE It's not huge. (suddenly insecure) Why don't I show these to you when we get a little closer. 
Jane starts to roll up the blueprints, fumbles a little. Adam finishes for her. She thanks him with her eyes. 
ADAM So, I think next we should stake out the addition... see how it all feels - size wise... JANE Sounds great. ADAM I'll e-mail you and we'll set it up. We did good work today. Jake, nice meeting you. 
Jake smiles and waves as Adam exits, walking to his car. JAKE (turns to Jane) Got time for a cup of coffee? 
Adam can't help but sneak a look back at them.   Jane waves, a bit embarrassed. 
36   INT. JANE'S KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER                          36 Jane moves nervously around the kitchen, opening the fridge, taking out juice... 
JAKE Why haven't you returned any of my calls or e-mails? 
JANE Jake, come on. This is just too weird. We have to just never do what we did - ever again. You're an adulterer and I'm an awful person, basically. I haven't slept in days. What we did was just so wrong on so many levels. 
JAKE And it was so right on a couple of levels too. Admit it. 
JANE (finally settles) No! It wasn't! On no levels was it right! 
JAKE You can't say we didn't enjoy each other's company. Sitting at the bar, dancing...after dancing... (she doesn't want to be reminded) Come on, you and I haven't had fun like that in a hundred years. JANE Yes! Because we're not supposed to have fun like that! We're divorced!   Are you like, what? Unhappy at home?   Does she not "understand" you? Did you just want to know what it would be like with someone my age? What is this? 
JAKE I'd be lying if I said I never think about you, Janey. I think about you. A lot. And no, it's not perfect at home. Obviously. Look at me. I've got three grown kids and I'm going to kindergarten interviews. I'm a walking cliche. 
Jane shrugs.   She agrees. 
JAKE And I can't, literally can't stop thinking about what happened in New York. Fate brought us together once, maybe it happened again. (she pauses...) And I know... you've moved on with your life, I get it, but you can't deny something real and honest happened that night. Can't we just go with it, see where it takes us. No one has to know. (Jane shudders) You were so great. So loose and sexy. How often do you get to be like that?    You can run and open restaurants and build your perfect kitchen but what about having someone to hold you in the middle of the night...? 
JANE Not high on my list these days. 
JAKE You've gotten a little nuts. 
JANE (slipping into her robe) Jake, I think it would be really good for us to not talk for a few days. Okay? JAKE (turning back to her) You know what I think -- just for the record? I think we're doing something kinda brilliant. All the things that tore us apart aren't issues anymore. I'd say our problems actually went away. 
JANE What..? JAKE Didn't you always say you felt you weren't being heard? Wasn't that our big issue -- both of us always feeling rejected and unappreciated. Look at us now. You're so much more together, you're not exhausted all the time, you're not catering every weekend and busy all day with the kids and I'm calmer, less obsessed about work. I'm a partner. I'm there. We grew into the people we wanted each other to be! And I don't know... I appreciate things about you I couldn't even see before. 
JANE (not wanting to get into it) Really? (MORE) JANE(cont'd) Well, you know, I'm not as good as you at remembering all the details of our... 
JAKE (getting dressed) -- Do you remember never having time for sex? Now look at us. We've already done it two times this week and it's only Tuesday. I swear to God, if half the couples who got divorced, could get back together 10 years later, their problems would be solved. I think we're on to something. 
JANE Not sure I agree and...also, we're not back together. JAKE And I know other divorced people think about this...they wonder - what if.... (fixes his tie) I think this is very French of us. 
JANE How is this French of us? 
JAKE I have a young wife but I'm having sex with my old wife. Not old, you know. Ex! (Jane nods....) I didn't mean old... 
39   Jane tosses Jake his jacket. They EXIT the BEDROOM and head toward THE FRONT DOOR. 
JAKE You're doing that thing where you act like you're not listening... but think about what I'm saying, okay? (then) Do you have any of your homemade granola here? I haven't had it in so long. 
JANE You miss it? 
JAKE So much. 
JANE We sell it for $6.50 a bag at the store. 
JAKE Yeah, why give it away when you can... (Jane OPENS the front door and moves him outside) Kiss good bye? 
Jane kisses him on the cheek. 
JAKE She wants to be courted! (as he heads for his car) I can do that! (turns back) And honey, thanks for the.... (indicates sex with his fingers) -- Coffee.... 
Jane can't close the door fast enough. 
40   INT. JANE'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                40 Jane carries three beautiful homemade pies, arriving in THE LIVING ROOM where her Friends are gathered. Platters of food and open bottles of wine are on the coffee table. 
TRISHA Oh my God, now what?   Three pies?! This is a feast! 
JANE I don't know what's going on, I have so much energy lately which I think is probably a result of... all the sex I'm having. (the Ladies LAUGH) Yeah. I'm actually not kidding. I'm having an affair. (They stare at her) With a married man. 
DIANE What? When did this happen? Where'd you meet him? 
JANE Well, it... started in New York. 
DIANE In New York??? Last week? 
JANE Yeah, we did it once there and once here. Maybe more than once there, I was drunk so... 
TRISHA You had drunken sex with a married man in New York when you went for Luke's graduation? 
JANE (laughs, embarrassed) Turns out I'm a bit of a slut. (re: pies) Apple, Blueberry or Plum? DIANE Wait, wait, wait. Hold on.... You're not saying!!!! 
JOANNE (clueless) -- What? 
TRISHA (catching on) No! You're not! 
JANE Oh, God, but I am. I'm having an affair with Agness Adler's husband. 
The Women all SCREAM as Jane fans herself. 
JANE (laughs at Adam) Feels perfect. 
ADAM I thought so too. JANE (taking it all in) This is heaven! ADAM It's gonna be cool.    Want to go upstairs? 
43   JANE AND ADAM ATOP SIDE BY SIDE LADDERS                     43 ADAM So if you were lying in bed, this would be your view. 
Jane breaks into a smile. 
THEIR POV - IN THE DISTANCE -- THE OCEAN 
Over this tranquil view -- A CELL RINGS. Jane takes her phone out of her pocket, sees it's Jake calling. She pauses, then pushes "IGNORE" and then promptly loses her balance. Adam immediately reaches over and steadies her. 
ADAM You okay? 
JANE (grabs her heart) Yeah. 
CUT TO: 
WATER RUNNING OUT OF A FAUCET 
44   INT. BATHROOM - JAKE'S HOUSE - SAME TIME                    44 Water is running in the sink, even though no one's at the sink. Jake is in the shower stall, fully dressed, putting away his cell. He quietly pushes the shower door open and then carefully shuts it with a small snap. Jake fake coughs and then turns off the sink water. He checks his watch when he hears GLASS BREAKING in another room then hears Agness calling his name in anger. He leaps. 
JAKE Coming! 
Jake quietly UNLOCKS THE BATHROOM DOOR and EXITS to find his path is blocked by Pedro who sits on a tricycle staring up at him. 
PEDRO What were you doing in there? 
JAKE Going to the bathroom. 
PEDRO The toilet didn't flush. 
JAKE Yes it did. 
PEDRO Why were you in the shower with your clothes on? 
JAKE (making sure Agness doesn't hear) What are you talking about? 
PEDRO I heard the shower door close. 
JAKE What do you have, x-ray ears? 
Agness joins in briefs and a white tank, black bra peeking through. She holds a broom. 
AGNESS What's up Pedro? 
PEDRO Jake took a shower with his clothes on. 
JAKE Pedro!    Darling... AGNESS What's he talking about? 
JAKE I don't speak Pedro.   That's your department. 
AGNESS (to Pedro) Don't go in the kitchen, P, I broke something. (to Jake, annoyed) Yo. Can you help? 
Agness EXITS back to the kitchen as Pedro stares at Jake. 
CUT TO: 
45   TWO GORGEOUS CROQUE-MONSIEURS - COMING OUT OF AN OVEN       45 These open-faced fancy French Grilled Cheese Sandwiches are carried to Jane's counter. We're: 
JANE No.... (starts to say something.) No. 
ADAM No? 
EXT. JANE'S HOUSE - SAME TIME Jake rises from the bushes outside of Jane's Kitchen Window. He PEEKS in the window, balancing himself precariously on a stack of loose bricks. He sees Jane telling Adam a story and both of them cracking up. Jake leans in further to try to hear what Jane's saying when the bricks slip under his feet, he loses his balance and drops OUT OF THE FRAME. 
51   INT. JANE'S HOUSE - A BIT LATER                               51 Jane walks Adam to the door.    He holds rolled blueprints. 
ADAM This was so nice and relaxing and the lavender ice cream was actually the best dessert of any sort I've ever had... like, in my life. 
JANE Aw, thank you. I always make ice cream when I can't sleep, so I'm glad someone was here to eat it. (opens door) 
ADAM (pauses...) Great getting to know you a little. 
JANE (nods) It was really fun. 
Adam waves, Jane waves. Definitely a little sweet/awkward. Jane closes her door, starts turning out lights, heading for the kitchen, when there's a QUICK KNOCK on the FRONT DOOR. 
JANE Woops!   Coming! 
Jane quickly returns to the door and opens it to find: 
JAKE 
leaning in the door frame. 
JAKE O.M.G. I thought he'd never leave. (entering) Hello Jane, you look very beautiful tonight. 
He takes her in his arms. 
JAKE Mmmmm. Love when you smell like butter. 
JANE (easing away) What are you doing here? 
JAKE Missed you. 
JANE It's nine o'clock. Where does your wife think you are? 
JAKE At yoga.   Shall we do some downward facing dog? 
JANE Not tonight big guy. 
They CROSS INTO THE KITCHEN. CAMERA TRACKS. 
JAKE Is it really necessary for you to always say no before you say yes? I won't think less of you, you know. 
JANE Really, Jake, I'm a little tired, I was just gonna take a bath. 
JAKE Good. So, we'll just hang out. (now IN THE KITCHEN, he SEES the dinner dishes on the counter) Ooooo, is that Croque-Monsieur? Who's plate is this? Yours or his? 
JANE Mine. 
JAKE (eats her leftovers, savors the taste) Oh my God, just as I remember it. 
JANE Don't you ever eat at your house? 
JAKE Pedro dictates all meals and he has a very limited palate. (sees melted ice cream) What kind of ice cream is that? 
JANE Lavender Honey. 
JAKE (looking down at her, smiles) Tell the truth, Janey is this a great affair, or what? 
JANE I don't know. It's my first. 
JAKE (climbing down) We don't even have to have sex and it's fun. (arrives next to her) I wish I could sleep over. 
JANE I gotta tell my shrink about this. This is a lot to handle. I guess you should go ... I'm sure yoga's probably closed by now. (MORE) JANE(cont'd) Oh, you got a little ice cream on your shirt. Let me get that out. 
JAKE It's okay... 
Jake takes Jane in his arms and gives her a deep hug. He lingers, kissing her neck, smelling her skin. She kisses him on the cheek. He slides her robe off her shoulder. He softly caresses her shoulder, kissing it, then makes his way up her neck.   Jane gives in and kisses Jake fully on the lips. He pulls her close, her robe falling. 
JANE Wow, wow, wow...what's happening, Jake? 
The Phone RINGS.   Jane pauses. JAKE Don't get it. JANE I always get it. I have three kids. (Jake wishes she wouldn't. She hesitates, picks it up) Hello. Hiii... (makes an I told you so face) You still on the plane? How was Luke when you left? Oh, that sounds like fun. Let me know what I can bring..... No! Don't have any idea where he is. (points to Jake) Okay, honey, talk to you tomorrow. (hangs up) Now I'm lying...... Lauren and Harley are giving Luke a graduation party this weekend. Sweet, huh? 
Jake's CELL PHONE RINGS, sees it's Lauren calling. 
JAKE (into phone) Hello stranger. Welcome back. 
Jane OPENS THE DOOR and Jake darts over for a quick kiss and then EXITS toward his car. They wave to one another. 
JAKE (into phone) -- Just getting in my car. This weekend? Sounds great. Let me know what I can bring... 
Jake looks to Jane. She shakes her head -- he's shameless. Jake shrugs. Jane watches as Jake drives off, talking on his cell. 
54   EXT. SANTA BARBARA STREET - EARLY MORNING                  54 Jane paces outside of a medical building, holding a box from her bakery.   She's clearly waiting for someone. 
She spots a comfortably dressed MAN IN HIS MID FORTIES holding the leash of an Airedale and approaching the building's entrance. 
JANE (approaching him) Dr. Allen! 
DR. ALLEN (surprised to see her) Jane. Hi. Am I seeing you today? JANE No, I just need to talk...and I was wondering if there was any chance you could squeeze me in for an emergency session. I'm sort of desperate for some advice. I brought you some of that coffee cake you like. Not as a bribe or anything... 
DR. ALLEN (checks his watch) I only have twenty minutes until my first patient. 
JANE That's fine. I'll talk fast. 
55   INT. BUILDING CORRIDOR - UPSTAIRS - MOMENTS LATER          55 Jane, Dr. Allen and the Dog walk the corridor. 
JANE (whispering) So, at this point, I just need some sound, unbiased guidance. Is having an affair with you know who a good thing or a bad thing? (they stop at Dr. Allen's office door) It's a bad thing, right? How could it be good? 
DR. ALLEN (opening his door) It's not good. It's not bad. 
Oh, man.   Not what she needs to hear. 
56   INT. OFFICE                                                56 Jane sits in a chair across from an empty chair.   Dr. Allen turns on a few lamps as his dog settles. DR. ALLEN You know, things happen in life and our job is to find out why. What we have to do is take a real look at this. Are you ready to do that? 
JANE I am. Definitely. I've made a list of what this can possibly be about...at my end. Can I read it to you? 
DR. ALLEN (taking his seat) Of course. JANE (digging out her Blackberry) Thanks. I e-mailed it to myself. (reads from Blackberry) Okay. Am I still trying to figure out why the marriage failed? Do I want to get back together? Do we have unfinished business? Is this about revenge?   Am I just... lonely? Or, is it my "caretaker" thing? (MORE) JANE(cont'd) You know, the kids are finally gone and now all of a sudden Jake's back and I get to take care of him in some way... 
Dr. Allen nods, impressed with the work she's done. JANE And, listen, I get how therapy works, I do... We look at things, we examine them, weeks turn into months, what....? we're going on eight years, right?.... and I'm okay with that, I like it... but in this case, I need to know what you really think. Like, I'd like you to say... Don't do this, it's absolutely wrong or go ahead, you'll be fine. I actually want to be told what to do. 
DR. ALLEN What's interesting is I'm already seeing you open up more than I have in some time. I'm thinking, through this affair, you may learn to view the world in a different way. 
JANE I'm sorry. I need more concrete. Are you saying I should keep seeing him? Because, honestly, if the guilt and fear could go away, maybe I could let go a little and figure this out. 
DR. ALLEN I wouldn't resist looking at this. 
Jake's cell RINGS.    He turns his back to take it. 
JAKE (into cell) Hi Ag... Just got here. 
Jane has a hot flash.    Starts fanning herself. 
JAKE (into cell) Okay, I will. Yeah, no, I know. (turns back to the family) I'm sorry guys, I gotta hit it. 
JANE Bye-bye. 
The Girls look to Jane. 
JAKE I have to stop at the market. Agness is making some pasta thing and she ran out of olive oil. 
GABBY Hey, at least she's finally cooking. 
JAKE So...see everybody at the party tomorrow... LAUREN Yeah.   It's gonna be so fun. 
JANE (to Lauren) I told you I'm bringing someone, right? 
LAUREN No. Who? 
JANE Adam.   My architect. 
JAKE You're bringing your architect? 
JANE Yes I am. 
JAKE Like as a date? 
JANE (looking right at him) Yeah. 
GABBY I like the idea. 
JANE Me too. 
HARLEY Yeah, seems like it should round out everything really nicely. (pouring another drink) Nobody wants wine but me? 
Luke opens a cupboard, takes out a bottle of olive oil, hands it to Jake. 
LUKE Here, now you can stay another five minutes. (catches Jane's eye) You have three bottles in there. 
JAKE Janey, can I talk to you privately? Just for a sec. 
Jane heads out still holding the carving knife.   Harley slips the knife out of her hand. 
HARLEY There you go.... (to Kids) Somebody's talkin' graduation gift. 
78   INT. COURTYARD                                             78 Jane and Jake stand in the courtyard off of the Living Room. 
JANE What is it, Jake?   What? 
JAKE I don't get not calling me back. 
JANE `Cause I don't care what your excuse is. (shuts the door to the living ) 
JAKE She didn't go out, Jane. She cancelled her plans and every time I tried to call or write, she caught me. I wanted to be here. 
JANE You know what, Jake? You were worried about rocking the boat at home? Well now you're rocking my boat and I don't like it. 
She OPENS THE DOOR A LITTLE WIDER and we NOW SEE she's eating a gi-normous piece of cake. 
ADAM (trying not to react to that, ENTERS, handing her the gift.) This is for you. 
JANE Really? Thank you! Come on in. (takes a huge bite of cake) Can you hold this for a sec? (hands him the cake plate) Oh my God... (takes another bite) -- this could be the best cake I ever made. You want a piece? It's like... beyond... 
ADAM I think I'm good. 
JANE (focusing on the gift) I can't believe you brought me a gift?! So nice! 
Jane unwraps the gift, turns it around, looks at it. 
JANE An appointment book? 
ADAM I sort of assumed you didn't have one. 
JANE --Because I never remember our... Awww.... 
ADAM I took the liberty of filling in our next two meetings. And marked them with post-its and wrote them in red and then highlighted them in neon yellow. 
JANE Thank you! 
Jane kisses Adam on the cheek just as he was moving and the kiss lands on his lips. 
JANE Sorry. 
ADAM I'm not. (Did he really say that? Then, he licks his lips) Wow, that cake is good. 
Jane laughs a little too hard. 
83   INT. ADAM'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT                          83 JANE So, let me ask you something and please don't think I'm weird or out of line or anything... but do you by any chance poke smot? ADAM Do I...?? 
JANE I mean do you smoke pot?! I haven't asked anyone that question since I was twenty-two. 
ADAM Uh. No, I don't. But I have. But I don't think I've had any since my kids were born...so not in like 27 years. 
JANE Oh my God, we have kids the same age! And I haven't had any since my kids were born either!!! Except for tonight. I had one hit off of this. 
Jane pulls the joint out of her purse, just as they pull up next to a Police Car. 
ADAM You might not want to hold that quite so... (nods) Hello Officer. 
JANE (turns, SEES the Cop Car, GASPS and DROPS THE JOINT, then TURNS to Cop, waves, then:) I actually know him! Blueberry scone and a latte. (the Cop nods, pulls away) Oh my God! That was horrifying. I instantly saw myself in a mug shot. My heart is leaping out of my... (then distracted) Wow... This is the most insane dashboard I've ever seen. It's like we're in a cockpit. It's spectacular. Adam, what kind of car is this? 
ADAM Jane? 
JANE (turns to him) Hi. 
ADAM Did you get this high from one hit? 
JANE Yes! I don't know what they've done to pot over the last 30 years but it rockkkkks! 
84   EXT. LAUREN AND HARLEY'S COTTAGE - NIGHT                    84 From OUTSIDE, we can see lots of folks in the Living Room. Candles dot the path up to the cottage door. Several Couples and College Kids are walking toward the house. 
85   ANGLE - BEHIND NEARBY BUSHES                                85 Jane and Adam are sharing the joint.   Jane takes a tiny, lady- like hit, passes it to Adam. 
JANE (whispers) Don't take too much, it's really strong. 
She blows out the smoke. Adam, on the other hand, takes a huge hit. 
JANE (whispers giddily) I'm stoned. 
JAKE What?! You smoked the joint I gave you? 
JANE You told me to!    It's a-mazing!!! 
JAKE But you weren't supposed to smoke it with him, you're supposed to smoke it with me! 
JANE Somebody's jealous.... 
JAKE Yes, of course. Why shouldn't I be... you're my... 
JANE -- What?   What am I, Jake? 
JAKE You're my ex-wife, lover, oldest friend and girlfriend. 
Jane blurts out a laugh. 
JANE Okay. You're hilarious. And because of that, even though I kind of hate you/love you, I'm going to let you have some... 
JAKE You love me? I mean, I heard "hate" had top billing, but... 
Jane takes the joint out of her purse, lights it up and hands it to Jake. Just as she does that, THE DOOR OPENS and HARLEY ENTERS, thinking the bathroom is free. Jake quickly yanks him in, shuts the door, locks it. Harley is now caught between Jane and Jake and a cloud of smoke. 
HARLEY Oh my God, you're smoking weed in the guest bathroom. 
JAKE Yes we are and we'd appreciate it if you didn't tell anyone about this. 
HARLEY No. Never.     Adding it to the list. JANE Care for a toke? 
HARLEY I don't really smoke marijuana. 
JANE (blowing out smoke) Me either. 
HARLEY Okay, one hit. 
JANE (looks at herself in the mirror) (MORE) JANE(cont'd) Oh, my God. Is that what I look like? 
89   EXT. BACKYARD PATIO - MOMENTS LATER                          89 A small group is dancing to a hip hop song on the patio. Adam and Agness are dancing together. They're totally into it. Jane makes her way to the dance floor as the song ends and The Beach Boys "Wouldn't It Be Nice" begins. Jake follows Jane dancing his way toward the crowd, spinning Gabby on his way. Jake takes Jane's hand...dances with her. Harley arrives next to Lauren and Gabby who watch their parents. 
LAUREN They must be hammered. 
HARLEY Or something like that. 
Adam glances over and sees Jane and Jake. 
ADAM (to Agness) Sweetest divorced couple in the world..! 
Agness is surprised by how happy Jake looks with Jane. 
JANE (spotting Adam) Hey..! (to Jake) Jake, I'm gonna.... Jane and Adam cross toward one another. Jake dies a little as Jane leaves him, her eyes on Adam. Jake doesn't notice Agness is watching him.. Jane, now dancing with Adam, looks from Adam to Jake then back to Adam and then doesn't look back at Jake again. 
Jake is still as he watches the woman he loves slip away. Agness has her eyes firmly on Jake, not missing any of it. 
90   INT. ADAM'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT                             90 Adam drives Jane home.   Clearly the end of a great night. JANE Wow. Fun is not overrated, is it? 
ADAM You know what's great? 
JANE What? 
JAKE What's the difference? I was drowning over there. I'm not going to get that many more chances in my life to figure myself out. Janey, let's use these couple of days to see if we can make this work. 
JANE We can't, Jake. I told you this the other night. Please listen. 
JAKE But you were all pissy because you thought I stood you up. Things are different now. I'm a free man. (then) Can we just hug? I hate that you're being so distant. It's literally giving me a pain in my stomach. 
JANE Oh, God... 
Jane reluctantly hugs him.      He tries to kiss her. 
JANE See!    Too much! 
JAKE Okay!    Good note. 
Jane can't help but smile. 
JAKE Can I help with what you're doing? Hold your basket or... 
JANE I'm fine.... 
JAKE Okay... I'm going to go to the video store and get us all a dvd to watch tonight. We'll have movie night. Just like old times. How's that? I'll make the popcorn. Just then Jane's Cell RINGS. 
JANE Fine. (into phone) Hello... 
JAKE (whispers) I love knowing I'm coming back here. 
JANE (nods, turning slightly) Oh, hi... I slept great. How `bout you? 
Jake waits, but realizes Jane's not going to turn back. 
99    INT. FAMILY ROOM - JANE'S HOUSE - THAT NIGHT                 99 The Adlers are watching The Graduate. The lights are low. Jake, shoes off, hands everyone bowls of popcorn. Jane sits in a club chair. Harley's on the floor and the Adler Kids are on one long sofa, all covered in a blanket. Jake hands them popcorn then squeezes back in, between the Girls. 
ON THE FLAT SCREEN - BUCK HENRY AND DUSTIN HOFFMAN 
BUCK HENERY Are you here for an affair, sir? 
DUSTIN What? 
BUCK HENRY The Singleman party, sir? 
Jane cringes as the Kids laugh. She looks over at Jake snuggling between the Kids, all eating popcorn and laughing. He catches Jane's eye and mouths. 
JAKE I'M SO HAPPY!!! 
100   EXT. JANE'S HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT - EST.                 100 
101   INT. HOUSE - SAME TIME                                   101 Jake, bare legged and wearing a robe and slippers, crosses to the KITCHEN where he finds Luke and Gabby digging through the fridge. 
JAKE Any leftovers? 
GABBY Are you kidding? (takes out an armful of Tupperware) 
JAKE Any of that noodle thing left? (Gabby hands it to him.) Where's Mom? She disappeared so fast after the movie. 
GABBY She's probably sleeping. 
LUKE I think she's on her computer. 
They all nibble out of Tupperware, leaning against various counters. 
JANE And kinda girly. 
ADAM (taking it off) Not what I'm going for. (holds up a sweater) Gray sweater. Very old. JANE But cute. 
ADAM (slips it on) You sure? You don't have to say you like it just because you nixed the last 20 things. 
Jane likes this man. 
JANE Keep it. It's cozy.   Boy, you have a lot of clothes. 
ADAM (looks at the floor) Uh, not anymore. Okay, we're almost done. You are helping me so much by the way. 
JANE -- Adam, I really have to pee. 
ADAM Oh good. Me too. Meet you back in thirty.... (lifting the laptop) Putting this on my desk.... 
ON JANE'S SIDE 
Just a shot of Jane's Pillows on her bed. 
JANE'S VOICE I'm not in there... 
ON ADAM'S SIDE - AN ISIGHT FRAME OF AN EMPTY DESK CHAIR. 
ADAM'S VOICE Can't hear you. 
103    INT. JANE'S BEDROOM - WIDE - SAME TIME                      103 Jake pokes his head in, looks around, sees no one in the room. He hears Jane in the bathroom and ENTERS quietly, quickly squirms out of his boxers and T-shirt, then, DROPS HIS ROBE, and lies on his side, on the bed, completely NUDE -- elbow up, palm supporting his head -- a smile on his face. He changes his smile to a smoulder. 
Jake hears water running. Suddenly modest, he quickly drags over the open Laptop and places the open screen in front of his privates. He smiles, ready to be discovered. 
JANE 
A104   dries her hands at the bathroom sink.                      A104 
104    INT. ADAM'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME                             104 Adam crosses through the room on his way to his laptop. 
105    JANE ENTERS HER BEDROOM, SEES JAKE and lets out a SCREAM. 105 
Simultaneously, ADAM PLOPS DOWN IN HIS DESK CHAIR, LOOKS AT HIS SCREEN and instantly YANKS HIMSELF AWAY in disgust. 
ADAM Mother of -- (looks again) Ahhhhhhhhhhh!!!! 
Jake LOOKS DOWN AT THE SCREEN,    SEES ADAM'S SCREAMING FACE AND SCREAMS BACK. 
JANE What are you doing in here?!!! 
ADAM (covering the screen with his hands) Get it off!!! 
JAKE (covering himself) I wanted to see you. 
JANE Why are you naked!?! 
JAKE (sits up straight, the lap top shooting even more directly at his groin) Why do you think? 
ADAM Okay, I'm gonna be sick. 
Jake LEANS IN, covers Adam's eyes on the screen, which, of course, does nothing. 
ADAM Not working! Big close up! 
JANE Knowing how to be divorced is next to impossible... and sometimes over the years, I've thought that your Dad and I weren't quite finished. And, as it turns out, we weren't. So I went out of my comfort zone, which, I found out, if you're really honest with yourself, isn't all that comforting. So, I experimented with a part of myself. I wanted to find out if, after all these years there was still something there between us. 
LAUREN And was there? 
JANE There kinda was. 
Lauren smiles with her eyes. 
GABBY But Mom, you have to understand how bonkers this sounds to us. For two people who for years couldn't be in the same room together...to then have an affair??? You and Dad...! 
JANE I know...it was hard for me and I was doing it. I hope you'll forgive me for confusing you or betraying your trust, but I did this for me and for him and I realized even though your Dad and I once had something extraordinary... we no longer really fit together. But he is a part of me and always will be. 
LUKE So it's over now? You guys are back to being divorced. 
JANE For better or for worse. 
Lauren takes her Mom's hand. Harley joins them, sitting on the other side of the bed, holding back tears. 
HARLEY Group hug? 
And as they all move into hug, we: 
CUT TO: 
126   A MOVING POV - INT. ARCHITECTURE OFFICE - DAY              126 REVERSE ON JANE walking through Adam's firm.    She arrives at: 
127   ADAM'S OFFICE                                              127 Adam is on a phone call. 
ADAM (into phone) Yeah no problem...we can definitely do that... (notices Jane) -- James, can I call you back, someone just... Thanks. (rises) Hi. 
JANE Hi. May I come in? 
ADAM -- Sure. 
JANE I didn't call you last night because I wasn't sure you would take the call and then I thought that could go on for months and... ADAM -- I would have taken the call. 
JANE Oh. Well, anyway, it's better to say these things in person. Adam, the man I was seeing was... 
ADAM I think I'm up to speed on that part. 
JANE I want you to know it didn't last long and you're divorced, so maybe you understand, when marriages end, there's doubts and hurt, and you've got kids and sometimes you wonder if you did the right thing and when the moment presented itself... 
ADAM -- I get it. I could imagine it...I could... 
JANE I told him it wasn't going to work between us but I guess he didn't believe me and unbeknownst to me, he showed up at my house yesterday. He left Agness and... 
ADAM -- Jane. I actually think I understand what happened but...uh...you know I'm not as macho as I appear and I think it's probably best for us not to get any more... involved because your relationship with Jake isn't really done and I know you're saying it is, but he's in love with you and for everyone's sake, that should probably get resolved. 
JANE Wow.   So that's how grown ups talk. 
Adam smiles. 
JANE Please tell me you're not going to quit my job and ask Peter to take over because then I'll never get to see you and... 
ADAM I was thinking of asking Peter to step back in. 
JANE Oh... I hope you don't... 
ADAM Thanks.

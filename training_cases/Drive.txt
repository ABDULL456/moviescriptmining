1 INT. CAR ENGINE - NIGHT. 1 
We're close on a maze of metal rods, tubes, and wires. It's only as we pull out that we realize it's the engine of a car. Over the image we hear a voice talking on a phone. 
DRIVER O/S ...hundred thousand streets in this city, you don't need to know the route. You give me a time and place, I give you a five minute window. Those five minutes I'm yours. Whatever goes down I'm yours. Minute either side you're on your own... 
As the engine ignites and roars to life we DISSOLVE TO: 
2 INT. LOW RENT APARTMENT/ KOREATOWN/ L.A. - NIGHT. 2 
A map of downtown L.A. spread out on a bed, dozens of different routes marked in pencil. The voice continues - 
DRIVER O/S ...One last thing. You won't be able to reach me at this number again... 
DRIVER hangs up the phone. He folds his map of LA and slips it in his duffel bag. A few clothes and other essentials are neatly packed inside. He zips the bag shut and takes one last look at a cheap TV set. On screen, a movie is playing. On a radio, the LA Clippers are taking a pounding from the New York Knicks. 
3 INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT/ APARTMENT/ KOREATOWN - NIGHT. 3 
Driver strides through a dimly lit car park, carrying his duffel bag. A YOUNG COUPLE emerge from their car after a late night out. Driver lowers his eyes, avoiding their gaze as he makes his way towards a sleek 1970's Chevelle 
4 INT/EXT. DRIVER'S CAR/ ALVARADO - NIGHT. 4 
The Clippers-Knicks game plays on the car radio now. Driver is only half listening, focused on the road. We see his face in the passing neon lights. Feline good looks. Impassive blue eyes. Something almost melancholy in his unwavering gaze. He drives carefully, letting other cars overtake. 
5 EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 5 
Driver glides into the parking lot of another low-rent apartment block. 
6 INT. UNDERGROUND CAR PARK/ APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 6 
Clutching his duffel bag Driver heads towards the car park elevator. Hurrying out in the opposite direction he sees a pretty GIRL in her 20's wearing a waitress outfit. Their eyes meet briefly, before Driver walks on. 
7 INT. APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 7 
Driver heads down the hallway and unlocks the door to his new apartment. It's not all that different from his last one. Clean, sparse, and anonymous. He doesn't even bother to walk in. He tosses his duffel bag inside and locks the door again. 
8 INT/EXT. DRIVER'S CAR/ SILVERLAKE BOULEVARD - NIGHT 8 
Driver's back on the road, the basketball game still playing on the radio. He drives past a row of brightly lit Mexican food shacks on Silver Lake Boulevard and turns into a run down garage lit up with a neon sign - Shannon's Picture Car Warehouse - vintage cars. 
9 INT. SHANNON'S GARAGE/ SILVERLAKE BOULEVARD - NIGHT. 9 
SHANNON, the owner of the garage, has a distinctive limp. Driver follows him past rows of vintage cars. 
SHANNON ...Plain Jane cheap like you asked for but with a hundred and sixty horsepower inside. You get any sleep? 
DRIVER Not this week. 
As Shannon grins we feel the familiarity between them. 
SHANNON I can offer you some Halcyon. 
DRIVER Won't work. 
They head past more cars -- Fords, Dodges, Buicks -- until they arrive at a plain looking Impala. 
SHANNON There she is. Silver Impala. Most popular car in the state of California... 
Driver casts his eyes over the unimpressive vehicle then holds out his hand for the keys. 
10 INT/EXT. SILVER IMPALA/ TOY DISTRICT/ DOWNTOWN L.A. - NIGHT. 10 
The basketball game is approaching the end of the third quarter. Driver's behind the wheel of the Impala now, cruising past rows of dingy toy stores on 3rd Street. He glances at his watch. It's 9:50. He checks his mirror then turns into a side street. 
27 INT. NINO'S PIZZERIA/ WESTWOOD - DAY. 27 
A New York style pizza-by-the-slice restaurant. A WAITER takes a delivery of Chinese food at the door and carries it over to a table where Shannon is sitting with an old friend, BERNIE ROSE. 
WAITER Here you go, Mr. Rose. (Taking out the white boxes) Egg rolls, chicken chow mein, five flavor shrimp and Peking duck. 
BERNIE ROSE Did they remember the chop sticks? 
WAITER Doesn't look like it, sir. Let me run and get the guy. 
From the way the waiter hurries off we get a sense of Bernie's power and authority. He turns back to Shannon, resuming their conversation. 
(CONTINUED) 27 CONTINUED: 27 
BERNIE ROSE ...You run a perfectly good business. Why would you want to change now? 
SHANNON You know how much my business made last year? Thirty Grand. Takes me six months to build a car and a couple of seconds for these jerks to write it off on a stunt that doesn't even make it into the movie. 
Bernie shakes his head but clearly has a soft spot for Shannon. 
BERNIE ROSE How much do you need? 
SHANNON Let me talk you through it first. 
BERNIE ROSE That sounds like a lot. 
SHANNON Doesn't have to be. The big money teams burn through three, four million a year but that's `cause they're using half a dozen test drivers and a stable of cars. 
BERNIE ROSE I don't know anything about car racing but I assume there's a reason for that? 
SHANNON Sure, but it's not the only way. All I need is a hard-used stock car. We start off with the small-town action then work our way up. There's close to two thousand events out there and once we make the Show we're talking millions. 
BERNIE ROSE `Millions'? 
SHANNON There's a fortune to be made. Sponsorship. TV deals. We'll even name the team after you. 
Bernie looks at his friend in mild exasperation then turns away as the waiter returns with a handful of chop sticks. 
BERNIE ROSE Thank you, Ron. You sure you don't want any of this? 
(CONTINUED) 27 CONTINUED: (2) 27 
SHANNON No, thanks. 
Bernie waits for the waiter to leave then continues. 
BERNIE ROSE You still haven't given me a number? 
Shannon hesitates but only for a second. 
SHANNON Four hundred and thirty thousand dollars. 
Bernie Rose can't help grinning at his nerve. 
SHANNON Look, I wouldn't come to you unless I was sure about this. 
BERNIE ROSE Come on, Shannon. How can you be sure? What have you got these big money teams don't have? 
SHANNON I got a driver. 
BERNIE ROSE And they got half a dozen Drivers you told me. 
SHANNON Not like this one. 
He stares at his friend with quiet conviction. 
SHANNON I been working with this guy a long time - I've never seen anything like it. I had the money I'd back him myself... 
Bernie Rose considers him quietly. 
BERNIE ROSE But you don't have the money. 
SHANNON Everything I own is in metal. I had to sell my Bullit car the other day just to pay the gas bill. I'm telling you, Bernie, put this kid behind a wheel there's nothing he can't do. 
STOCK CAR OWNER Told you she was a beauty... 
SHANNON (Playing hard to get) Maybe where you come from... 
Bernie Rose pays no attention to their banter, his eyes fixed thoughtfully on the stock car as it finally slows to a stop. 
33 EXT. RACE CAR/ SAUGUS SPEEDWAY - DAY. 33 
Driver climbs out of the car. As he looks up he sees Shannon limping over with the stock car's owner, a couple of MECHANICS, and Bernie Rose. 
SHANNON Looks a little long in the tooth to me. Think we should take her home?... 
Driver shrugs. Shannon grins, turning to Bernie now. 
SHANNON Bernie, this is the driver I been telling you about... 
One look at Bernie Rose and Driver senses the power and authority behind his deceptively gentle eyes. 
SHANNON Bernie's thinking of investing in our race team... 
The old mobster holds out his hand, meeting Driver's gaze. 
DRIVER My hands are a little dirty. 
BERNIE ROSE Don't worry. So are mine... 
(CONTINUED) 33 CONTINUED: 33 
He gives Driver a big grin and a warm handshake, sizing him up. Driver smiles politely, gazing back at him. The stock car's owner interrupts the moment between them, holding a stopwatch. 
STOCK CAR OWNER Couldn't see much wrong with that. You beat the fastest lap by more than half a second. 
DRIVER You might wanna take a look at the suspension before we go again. (Turning back to Bernie) Nice to meet you... 
Bernie's still studying him. 
BERNIE ROSE You too... 
Their eyes stay on each other, then Driver follows the stock car owner and his mechanics back to the car. Bernie Rose stares after him quietly, thinking to himself. Shannon can feel he's getting interested. 
SHANNON You gonna give me the four? 
BERNIE ROSE I'll give you three for seventy percent... 
34 INT. SUPERMARKET/ ECHO PARK - DAY. 34 
Tinny supermarket music plays in the background. Driver walks past the vast selection of instant coffee brands, bemused by the choice. Suddenly he notices something out of the corner of his eye. At the far end of the aisle his pretty neighbor, Irene, is browsing through the confectionery section. Standing next to her is a young boy of six or seven, (BENICIO). He grabs a multi-pack of snickers and puts it in Irene's shopping basket. Irene calmly picks it out, replaces it on the shelf, and takes a single snicker bar for him instead. As Driver watches them, the boy turns around and notices him. Driver heads down another aisle before Irene sees him too, keeping to himself to himself. 
35 EXT. CAR PARK/ SUPERMARKET - DAY. 35 
Driver heads out of the supermarket with a small bag of groceries when he spots Irene and Benicio again in the car park. Irene sits in a battered Oldsmobile, trying to start the engine. She tries several times then gets out in frustration, opening the hood and peering at the engine she has no idea how to fix. Benicio peers in too, trying to be helpful. 
(CONTINUED) 35 CONTINUED: 35 
Driver hesitates, all his instincts telling him to continue to his car and drive away, but as he feels Irene's increasing frustration he can't help himself, finally heading over to help. 
Irene looks over and sees him coming, surprised at first, then smiling. We watch from a distance as they talk now. 
35a INT. ELEVATOR/ APARTMENT BLOCK/ ECHO PARK - DAY. 35a 
Driver, Irene and Benicio stand in silence in the elevator, Driver clutching some of Irene's grocery bags. 
36 INT. IRENE'S APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - DAY. 36 
Driver carries Irene's grocery bags into the kitchen for her. 
DRIVER Where do you want me to put them? 
IRENE Just over there. Thanks... 
Driver places the bags on the kitchen counter. 
IRENE Would you like something to drink? 
DRIVER Reseda Boulevard. 
IRENE You should tell Benicio you're a stunt guy. 
DRIVER He interested in that kind of stuff? 
IRENE Aren't all little boys? 
She smiles softly and he realizes she's teasing him. 
BENICIO O/S Mama, I don't like this... 
Irene takes the remote and changes the channel for him. Driver watches her quietly, then drains his glass of water. 
IRENE Would you like another glass? 
DRIVER I should get going... 
He catches the disappointment in her eyes, but she covers it with another good humored smile. 
(CONTINUED) 37 CONTINUED: (3) 37 
IRENE Well, thank you for your help. 
DRIVER Thank you for the drink... 
She takes his empty glass and walks him to the door. 
38 EXT/INT. STREET/ DRIVER'S APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - DAY. 38 
Passing traffic roars by on the busy street. Irene and Benicio are walking home from the bus stop, chatting happily. They look like they've just come back from the beach, Irene carrying a basket full of towels, Benicio clutching a dusty soccer ball. 
Driver watches them from the window of his apartment, blowing gently on a cup of coffee. 
39 INT/ EXT. DRIVER'S CAR/ HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - NIGHT. 39 
The reflection of passing neon rolls down the Camaro's windscreen. Driver's cruising down Hollywood Boulevard, shut off from the world outside, listening to `Purple Rain'. The HOOKERS and HIPSTERS have taken over the streets while up above airbrushed movie stars stare down from their lofty billboards. 
40 EXT. PARKING LOT/ MINI MALL - MORNING. 40 
It's early morning and Driver's been driving all night, unable to sleep. He heads across the parking lot towards a garishly lit mini-mall. Up ahead a small group of GANGBANGERS are hanging out with intent. They see him coming and look over intimidatingly. Driver's only reaction is to bunch his car keys in his hand, the longest key sliding between his second and third fingers like a weapon. The gangbangers don't see it but the unflinching look in his eyes unnerves them and they look away, letting him pass. 
41 EXT/ INT. BUFFALO BAR AND GRILL/ LA - MORNING. 41 
Jukebox music plays in the bar and grill. Driver sits on his own, working his way through a plate of bacon and eggs. 
BEARDED REDNECK OFFSCREEN Mind if I cut in?... 
Driver looks up and sees a burly REDNECK with an unkempt beard and a wrestler's physique. The redneck slides into the seat opposite him. 
BEARDED REDNECK You're Shannon's buddy, right? We met last year. You drove me and my brother back from Palm Springs... 
(CONTINUED) 41 CONTINUED: 41 
Driver stares into the redneck's coked-up eyes, then looks back down at his food. 
BEARDED REDNECK Next run we hired another wheelman - I spent six months in jail, my brother got himself killed... (He grins through yellowing teeth) He wasn't much, mind you, just family... 
Driver doesn't seem to hear him. 
BEARDED REDNECK Thing is - 
DRIVER I'm not interested... 
Driver looks up quietly, fixing him with his icy gaze. The Redneck's smile slowly fades. He considers his response for a moment, then decides against it, standing up. 
BEARDED REDNECK Well, it's good to see you again... 
Driver carries on eating as if the man didn't exist. 
42 EXT. FORECOURT/ SHANNON'S GARAGE - DAY. 42 
The loud stutter of an unhealthy engine. Shannon sits in the second hand race car he bought in Montecito, revving the engine. 
Driver and Benicio sit in the Chevelle, driving in silence. 
DRIVER Your mom said you like movies? 
BENICIO Sometimes. 
DRIVER Ever see the Terminator? 
BENICIO No. 
DRIVER Grease? 
Benicio shakes his head. 
DRIVER Wanna see where it was shot? 
45 INT. SHANNON'S GARAGE/ SILVERLAKE BOULEVARD - DAY. 45 
Shannon's got his tool kit out, examining the Olds. Irene looks at the forecourt but there's no sign of Driver and her son. 
(CONTINUED) 45 CONTINUED: 45 
IRENE How long has he been working for you? 
SHANNON Don't worry, ma'am, your son'll be fine. 
IRENE I didn't mean it like that... 
Shannon smiles to himself, sensing her interest in Driver. 
SHANNON We been together about five years now. He showed up out of the blue one day, no references or nothin', asking me for a job. I offered him half the wages I normally pay and he didn't even blink. Been exploiting him ever since... (HE GRINS) Only thing he knows is cars... 
46 INT/ EXT. DRIVER'S CAR/ LA RIVER - DAY. 46 
The car roars along the drainage canals. In the passenger seat Benicio looks tense but exhilarated. The car glides past a landscape of abandoned shopping carts, garbage bags, and shredded tires, picking up speed all the time. 
47 EXT. LA RIVER - DAY. 47 
Driver's parked the car now in an area of the drainage canal which looks like an oasis. He leans against the vehicle, soft rock playing on his radio as he watches Benicio climb a tree. 
48 INT. DRIVER'S CAR/ SILVERLAKE - NIGHT. 48 
Benicio is asleep in the back of Driver's car now. Driver's giving him and Irene a ride back to their apartment. Irene looks at Driver, waiting for him to say something, but he keeps his eyes fixed on the road. 
49 INT. BENICIO'S BEDROOM/ IRENE'S APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT.49 
Cradling the sleeping Benicio in his arms Driver lays him down on his bed. Irene takes off her son's clothes and puts on his pyjamas, careful not to wake him. Driver slips out of the room, uncomfortable with the intimate moment between mother and son. 
50 INT. LIVING ROOM/ IRENE'S APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 50 
Irene walks out of the bedroom, smiling at Driver gratefully. 
IRENE Thank you for today. He had a great time... 
(CONTINUED) 50 CONTINUED: 50 
DRIVER I'm glad... 
He stares back at her in the silence, both of them looking a little uncertain. 
IRENE I'm sorry if I put you on the spot, you know, just showing up like that... 
DRIVER Don't worry... 
Their eyes stay on each other, the attraction palpable. Driver finally breaks the tension, making a tentative move towards the door. Irene opens it for him, looking up into his eyes. Driver knows he could kiss her, wants to, but something inside holds him back. Instead he just offers his help. 
DRIVER You need a ride anywhere over the weekend I'm not doing much... 
50a INT. DENTISTS/ NORTH HOLLYWOOD - DAY. 50a 
Benicio sits in a dentist's chair, looking nervous. Irene sits beside him, mimicking his expression, trying to make him relax. 
51 EXT. DENTISTS/ NORTH HOLLYWOOD - DAY. 51 
IRENE'S FRIEND It's 8:30. Teeth. Pyjamas. TV off. 
BENICIO It's not the TV. It's a DVD... 
Driver looks back at Irene now. She puts down the phone, forcing a smile but still looking distracted. 
55 INT/ EXT. DRIVER'S CAR/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 55 
Irene sits next to Driver in the passenger seat, staring out of the window at the glittering fountain in Echo Park. 
(CONTINUED) 55 CONTINUED: 55 
IRENE I've never come this way before... 
DRIVER It's a short cut... 
IRENE The park looks pretty at night... 
She looks at Driver, watching him quietly, then looks away again. 
DRIVER You okay?... 
Irene takes a long time to answer, still staring out of the window. 
IRENE That was my husband's lawyer on the phone. He's getting an early release... 
She tries to sound casual. Driver takes the news quietly, even though it hits him like a sledgehammer. 
DRIVER That's great... 
IRENE I'm happy for Benicio... 
Driver knows she's trying to explain herself but doesn't say anything, driving in silence. 
Up ahead the traffic lights turn red and the car slows to a stop. 
Inside, the silence is unbearable. Irene pauses, then looks at Driver. He's even more handsome in the shadowy half-light, something achingly lonely and melancholy about his stillness. 
She hesitates, then moves her hand towards his, brushing the back of his hand, then slipping her fingers between his. 
The gesture is tiny but charged with emotion. They both stare out in silence, fingers clasped, then Irene gently withdraws her hand, as if nothing's happened. 
Outside the lights change to green. 
56 INT. IRENE'S APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - SUNSET. 56 
The sound of laughter. A sign over the door says, Welcome home Dad. Inside the apartment there's a small party going on. 
(CONTINUED) 56 CONTINUED: 56 
Irene's husband, STANDARD, has been released from jail and his FRIENDS and FAMILY are here to celebrate. Holding Benicio in his arms he makes a thank you speech to his guests. 
STANDARD ...I'm touched and grateful that you're all here today -- even though I know it's probably for the food not me... 
His self-deprecating humor gets a chorus of laughter and agreement from the guests. Irene is standing next to her friend Cindy, looking a little uncomfortable. 
STANDARD ...Anyhow, now that I've completed my MBA in catering from Chino Business School... (MORE LAUGHTER) Irene, Benicio and I are finally going to get our lives back together... 
He raises his glass to her. 
STANDARD I'd like to thank my wife for being the smartest, most beautiful, most patient and loyal woman I know... 
More applause. Irene stares back at Standard's handsome face, feeling even more uncomfortable. 
57 INT. DRIVER'S BEDROOM/ APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - SUNSET. 57 
Driver lies on his bed, gazing up at the ceiling, listening to the sound of the party echoing down the corridor. 
58 INT. IRENE'S APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 58 
It's nighttime and the party's getting louder. Standard's on the phone to someone, trying to hear them over the music. 
STANDARD I'm sorry, I can't hear you... 
STANDARD Must be pretty good? 
DRIVER I get by. 
STANDARD Not like a nine to five gig, huh?... 
(CONTINUED) 60 CONTINUED: (2) 60 
He's still smiling but there's a slight edge to his voice. Irene looks uncomfortable. 
IRENE You want me to take that? 
STANDARD No, we got it. 
His eyes are still fixed on Driver. 
STANDARD You want to come in, join us for a drink? 
DRIVER I've got some things to do. 
STANDARD At this hour of night? 
IRENE Standard, he's busy... 
Standard doesn't respond, still holding Driver's gaze. 
STANDARD Well, if we're still going by the time you're back you know where we are. It's good to meet you... 
He slips his arm around his son now and continues down the corridor, brushing past Driver on his way to empty the trash. Driver looks at Irene, then heads off in the same direction as Standard and Benicio to take the elevator. The two men stand there in charged silence, one emptying the trash, the other waiting for the elevator, only Benicio oblivious to the tension. 
61 EXT/ INT. DRIVER'S CAR/ LA - NIGHT. 61 
Brooding movie stars look down from the billboards. Driver is in his car now, soft rock playing on the radio. 
62 INT. IRENE'S APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - DAY. 62 
Standard is helping his son get ready for school, interacting with him affectionately. Irene watches them from the doorway, looking thoughtful. 
63 EXT/ INT. DRIVER'S CAR/ LA - DAY. 63 
Anonymous streets roll by, Driver's eyes fixed on the road. 
64 INT. CHUCK E. CHEESE RESTAURANT/ LA - NIGHT. 64 
Standard, Irene and Benicio are having dinner at a Chuck E. Cheese restaurant. We still sense the distance between Standard and Irene, but Benicio seems completely unaware of it, talking excitedly as he eats his pizza. Standard reaches out and takes Irene's hand gently as he listens to his son. 
65 OMITTED 65 
66 INT. SHANNON'S GARAGE/ SILVER LAKE BOULEVARD - DAY. 66 
A noise of hammering and drills. The corporate signage has been scraped off the race car and the seats ripped out. Bernie Rose has bought his partner Nino to the garage to take a look at his investment. 
NINO ...We paid three hundred fucking grand for this? 
BERNIE ROSE I paid for it. Out of my own pocket. Anyway, that's just the shell. You start with the shell, then you build the frame, then the motor. (Pointing to an engine nearby) I paid three hundred for that. The money goes on the inside not the outside. 
NINO Fuck that. If I'm gonna blow three hundred I wanna make sure everyone can see it. Go waste your money on something else... 
Shannon smiles nervously, worried Nino's going to sabotage his deal with Bernie. 
NINO (Pointing to a Thunderbird) ...How about that fucking pussy mobile over there. 
BERNIE ROSE You buy it. Shannon sell him the car... 
At the far end of the garage Driver hears them laughing, too busy working on his car to pay any attention. Shannon opens the door of the Thunderbird and invites Nino to take a seat. 
SHANNON Try her out. She's more comfortable than a water bed. 
(CONTINUED) 66 CONTINUED: 66 
NINO I already got a fucking water bed. 
He sits heavily in the car and starts prodding and pressing all the control buttons as if he wants to break them. 
DRIVER Call it fifty. 
Standard counts out some bills from his tattered wallet, his eyes lowered. 
STANDARD I was thinking of trading her in for a new car. Something fast and cheap. 
DRIVER You can't have both. 
STANDARD Alright then, fast. 
Even though he smiles Driver senses just a hint of tension on his handsome face. 
DRIVER (Pointing to a car) Something like that Buick over there'll cost you nine grand but there isn't much point in a city where you can't drive faster than sixty five. 
Standard considers the car a moment, something clearly bothering him, then looks back at Driver. 
STANDARD You must think I'm an asshole? 
Driver isn't sure what he's getting at. 
DRIVER I wouldn't know. 
STANDARD Well, I am. Six months inside for holding somebody else's stolen shit... 
He smiles ironically, his gaze still fixed on Driver. 
(CONTINUED) 67 CONTINUED: (2) 67 
STANDARD I appreciate what you did for my family when I was away but I don't plan to fuck up a second time... 
It's a thinly veiled message that he's back and here to stay. Driver stares back at him when Shannon emerges from the garage with Bernie Rose and Nino, calling out. 
SHANNON Hey, kid! Come say goodbye, the money people are leaving!... 
Driver and Standard stare at each other a moment longer then Driver breaks off. 
DRIVER Excuse me. 
STANDARD See you around... 
Driver walks off, leaving Standard alone with his thoughts. Shannon watches Standard curiously as Driver approaches. 
SHANNON Who was that? 
DRIVER Irene's husband. 
SHANNON (GRINNING) What did I tell you about married women? 
Nino can't resist another dig at Shannon. 
NINO What the fuck do you know about married women? 
BERNIE ROSE Can you for once say something without the word fuck in it? 
As they continue their banter, Driver glances at Standard. He's walking back to his car, dialling someone on his cell phone. 
68 INT/EXT. DRIVER'S CAR/ MEXICAN RESTAURANT/ DOWNTOWN - NIGHT. 68 
Passing traffic blurs past. Through the windows of a Mexican restaurant we see Irene at work, serving tables in her waitress's uniform. 
(CONTINUED) 68 CONTINUED: 68 
Driver's parked across the street, watching her from his car. He hesitates, conflicted, then finally gets out of the car. 
69 INT. MEXICAN RESTAURANT/ BROADWAY/ DOWNTOWN L.A. - NIGHT. 69 
Irene walks out of the kitchen with a tray of food, then stops as she sees Driver sitting at a booth. She looks surprised to see him, but pleased, serving her table first then heading over. 
IRENE Hi... 
DRIVER Hi... 
Their eyes stay on each other, oblivious to the noise. 
He's still shaken but tries to pass it off with a smile. 
STANDARD Fucking punks took me by surprise... 
Driver watches him, unconvinced. 
DRIVER Fucking punks didn't look like they needed to... 
Standard looks at him in surprise now. 
STANDARD You saw them, huh?... 
Driver doesn't answer, waiting for him to continue. Standard hesitates, still not sure whether to trust him. 
STANDARD You ever been inside? 
DRIVER Why? 
(CONTINUED) 73 CONTINUED: 73 
Standard takes another glance at the items laid out neatly by the sink. 
STANDARD I owed some protection money in the joint. 
Driver begins to see how worried he is. 
DRIVER How much? 
STANDARD They want twenty thousand. I told them I couldn't pay so they want me to do a job for them... 
DRIVER Is that why you need a car? 
Standard stares back at him. 
STANDARD What did you say you were inside for? 
DRIVER I didn't. 
A beat, then he finally opens up. 
STANDARD It's a pawn shop in the valley. I tried to back out tonight, they said they'd come after Irene and Benicio next time... 
Driver stares at him in surprise now, more concerned than he shows. 
DRIVER Why don't you take them away? 
STANDARD Where would I go? Irene finds out I fucked up again I'll lose everything... 
He sounds upset, angry with himself. 
STANDARD This lousy job's my only way out... 
Driver stares at his battered face and the blood stains on his t- shirt, then walks out of the bathroom to check on Benicio. 
74 INT. LIVING ROOM/ DRIVER'S APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 74 
Benicio is watching a baseball game on TV, his back to Driver. 
DRIVER You okay? 
The little boy nods without turning round, still frightened by his ordeal. 
DRIVER You want something to drink? 
Benicio shakes his head, trying to hide his tears. Driver heads over, then stops as he notices something in Benicio's hand. The little boy is clutching it as if he's afraid to let go. 
DRIVER What have you got there?... 
Benicio holds out his hand to reveal a small bullet. Driver stares at it, then looks at him. 
DRIVER Who gave you that?... 
BENICIO One of those men. He told me not to lose it... 
Driver sees him hit the sidewalk, arterial blood pumping from his neck. Blanche screams, grabbing the gym bag and leaping into the back seat of the car. Driver hesitates, takes one last look at Standard's lifeless body, then hits the gas as more gunshots crack behind him. 
As Driver's car roars down the street, the Chrysler suddenly comes to life, pulling out of its parking place. 
82 INT/ EXT. CAR/ STREET/ TARZANA/ LA - DAY. 82 
Driver glances in his rear-view mirror and sees the Chrysler on his tail. It doesn't seem to be trying to close the gap, just following at a discreet distance. In the back seat, Blanche zips open the gym bag, then stares in shock. 
BLANCHE ...Christ, there wasn't supposed to be this much money!... 
There are literally stacks of hundred dollar bills crammed inside the gym bag. Driver catches her reaction in the mirror, but his attention is focussed on the Chrysler. Up ahead, at an intersection, the lights turn red. Driver thinks about running them, but decides against it, braking sharply. The Chrysler draws up beside him, its windows glinting in the sunlight. 
BLANCHE Move for Chrissakes!... 
Driver ignores her, still watching the Chrysler out of the corner of his eye. The lights change to green but Driver doesn't move. Nor does the Chrysler. Behind them, other cars start honking their horns. Suddenly Driver roars off, swerving left at speed. 
The Chrysler reacts, screeching off in pursuit. 
Driver floors the gas. On speed and power his vehicle may be no match for the Chrysler, but in traffic the odds are even. He weaves his way past the slower cars, putting obstacles between himself and the Chrysler. The pursuing car matches him move for move, staying on his tail. 
In the back seat, Blanche looks terrified, buckling herself in. 
(CONTINUED) 49A 82 CONTINUED: 82 
Driver swerves left then suddenly makes a hard right onto a deserted canyon road. The mustang somehow manages to make the same turn. It gets close enough to "pit" Driver, its nose pressing against the rear corner of Driver's vehicle. 
Driver's almost run off the road, but manages to save it and regains control of his car. 
The Mustang pulls out wide to build momentum and smash into him. As it moves in to deliver the knockout blow, Driver pulls the Emergency Brake and spins 180 degrees, causing the Mustang to miss and lose control for a brief moment. 
Now the two cars are nose to nose, barrelling down the road, Driver heading in reverse as fast as he can, the Mustang closing fast. 
It rams Driver's front bumper. BAM! The two cars separated for an instant. 
The Mustang guns it, ready to smash into Driver again... 
Driver clocks an upcoming three way intersection dotted with construction equipment. In a last ditch attempt to evade his pursuer he throws a reverse 180, then incredibly keeps going, spinning 270 degrees. 
The Mustang tries to make the same turn, but this time the maneuver is beyond his ability. Driver's suckered him into a corner he can't control. 
The Mustang crashes into the construction equipment in a sickening crunch of metal on metal. 
Driver guns the motor and speeds away. 
83 EXT. MOTEL/ LA - DAY. 83 
Purple neon spills onto the forecourt of a seedy motel. 
84 INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY. 84 
The black gym bag lies open on a double bed, full to the brim with stacks of cash. Blanche sits on the bed, looking pale. 
DRIVER How much did Cook tell you you could expect to net? 
BLANCHE Forty Grand... 
She glances at the bag, staring at how much more money there is. Driver switches on the cheap TV set with the remote, flicking through the news channels. There's no mention of the robbery yet. He zips up the bag and heads out. 
DRIVER Stay here. Don't answer the door... 
Blanche nods, too shaken to protest. 
85 EXT. MOTEL/ LA - DAY. 85 
Driver hesitates, then dials a number on his cell-phone. Benicio answers. 
BENICIO'S VOICE ON THE PHONE Hello?... 
Driver hears the tremor in his voice. 
DRIVER Benicio?... 
BENICIO'S VOICE ON THE PHONE Yeah?... 
As she disappears inside Driver notices something on the bed where she's just been lying. It's her cell phone. Still flipped open as if she's called someone recently. 
Driver reaches for the cell phone when he notices the silhouette of a MAN crossing the curtains. Someone's outside. The door handle of the motel room starts to turn, slowly -- then suddenly there's the roar of a shotgun from the bathroom. 
Driver reacts in an instant, rushing towards the bathroom door. He has to barge it open, something obstructing his way. 
87 INT. BATHROOM/ MOTEL ROOM - DAY. 87 
Driver almost trips over Blanche's sprawled body as he bursts through. One quick glance and he knows she's dead - half her head blown off. Another quick glance and he sees her killer, a big burly HITMAN, trying to climb through the same bathroom window where he just shot her. 
Driver moves like lightning, grabbing the man's arms before he can get off another shot and pulling him through the window. The hitman lands heavily in a sea of broken glass, cutting his forehead open, blinded momentarily by the blood in his eyes. 
Driver takes his opportunity and slams the man's face back into the glass strewn floor, stunning him for a few more seconds as they struggle. Crawling away, he grabs the towel rack and pulls the metal bar off the wall. Using it as a spear he impales the hitman and grabs his shotgun. 
88 INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY. 88 
In the bedroom, the 2nd HITMAN finally kicks the door open. Driver bursts through the bathroom door at the same time -- firing the 1st shooter's shotgun. The force of the blast picks up the 2nd hitman and flings him against the wall like a rag doll. 
The startling explosion of violence is over just as suddenly as it began. Driver slumps to the floor in exhaustion, his hand and his arm ripped open by the broken glass. There's blood splatter all over the wall. Neon lights from outside flashing on the dead man's face. But no panicked footsteps or sirens yet. 
Driver crawls over to the dead hitman and rifles through his pockets. All he finds are a set of car keys. 
89 INT. OFFICE/ SHANNON'S GARAGE - DAY. 89 
Shannon stands in his office, listening silently on the phone, looking like he's been punched in the gut. 
(CONTINUED) 89 CONTINUED: 89 
SHANNON Why didn't you tell me?... 
All he hears is silence on the other end. 
SHANNON Well, I guess it's done now... 
He leans back against a car. 
SHANNON How big's the take?... 
DRIVER'S VOICE ON THE PHONE One million I guess... 
SHANNON Jesus... 
He looks dazed by the thought of so much money. 
SHANNON You better bring it over. 
DRIVER'S VOICE ON THE PHONE I'm hurt. I need a doctor to patch me up... 
SHANNON I'll take care of it... 
90 OMITTED 90 
91 INT. OFFICE/ SHANNON'S GARAGE - NIGHT. 91 
An underworld doctor, "DOC", a shabbily dressed old man who looks well past his prime takes out a small bottle of scotch along with his surgical tools, preparing for Driver's arrival. Shannon watches him uncertainly then heads downstairs as he hears a noise in the garage. 
92 INT. SHANNON'S GARAGE - NIGHT. 92 
Shannon arrives downstairs to see Driver walking unsteadily towards him in the gloom. Shannon can't help glancing at his hands, expecting him to be carrying the bag with the money, but there's no sign of it. 
93 INT. OFFICE/ SHANNON'S GARAGE/ SILVER LAKE BOULEVARD - NIGHT.93 
Scissoring Driver's blood soaked shirt away Doc examines the shards of glass embedded in his arm, then notices the deep scars running down his back. 
(CONTINUED) 93 CONTINUED: 93 
DOC ...Looks like you got more metal inside you than a ten ton truck... (His hand shakes) You'd be better off with a mechanic not a medic... 
Driver looks up at him warily from Shannon's pull out bed. 
DOC Relax. Just having my fun with you... 
Doc picks up his bottle of scotch from among his bowls of Peroxide and Betadine, takes a drink, then offers it to Driver. 
BERNIE ROSE That's what you should worry about... 
Shannon smiles back but Bernie senses how distracted he is. 
BERNIE ROSE You want my advice? Let your friend work it out for himself. Don't take pills for other people's headaches... (HE GRINS) You got twenty minutes? I need you to run down to the market and get me some milk... 
95 OMITTED 95 
96 INT. HALL/ STAIRS/ STRIP JOINT - DAY. 96 
Sunlight pours through a doorway. Driver heads down some stairs, passing some half naked STRIPPERS at the bar. There's a handful of CLIENTS watching a pole dance, but otherwise the place is empty. Driver turns down a long corridor. A couple of STRIPPERS emerge from their changing room, surprised to see him, but he puts them at ease with a friendly smile. 
DRIVER Cook moved office again? 
STRIPPER That one over there... 
Driver smiles gratefully, then heads towards an office at the end of the corridor. He knocks on the door. A voice calls back. 
(CONTINUED) 96 CONTINUED: 96 
COOK O/S It's open... 
Driver takes a hammer out of his jacket, then starts turning the door handle as if he can't get in. 
COOK O/S It's open, goddamit!... 
He hears Cook striding impatiently towards the door now. He waits, then suddenly kicks the door open, right in Cook's face. 
Before Cook can recover, Driver storms into the office, smashing him across the shoulder with the hammer. Cook collapses in a heap. Driver's about to hit him again, when he sees that Cook's left hand is broken and there are cuts and bruises on his face. Someone's clearly given him a beating since the robbery. 
DRIVER Should've figured you for a shill. Who were you fronting for? 
COOK Fuck you - 
Driver smashes the hammer into Cook's right hand now, breaking it too. Cook screams. Some of the strippers have gathered at the door but Driver couldn't care less. 
DRIVER Whose money am I holding? 
COOK Don't worry. They'll come get it. You don't know who you're fucking with - 
Driver smashes the hammer into the metal plates supporting Cook's left hand. He screams like a stuck pig. 
DRIVER Who's money am I holding? 
COOK (Barely able to get the words out) Fuck you... 
The strippers look stunned and riveted at the same time. Driver bends over Cook and rifles through his pockets. Finally he finds what he's looking for. Cook's cell phone. He scrolls down the call log and finds the same number appearing again and again. 
97 OMITTED 97 
98 INT. NINO'S PIZZERIA - DAY. 98 
The kitchen is busy, CHEFS taking out hot pizzas from the oven and slicing them up in takeaway boxes. In the background we hear the phone ringing. 
99 INT. BACK ROOM/ PIZZERIA - DAY. 99 
An impeccably dressed MAN IN A TAN SUIT answers the phone. 
TAN SUIT Hello?...I'm afraid we're closed. Could you call back after twelve... 
100 EXT. PARKING LOT/ BURGER KING/ SUNSET BOULEVARD - DAY. 100 
(INTERCUT) 
Driver leans against his car, talking on Cook's cell phone. 
DRIVER I could, but your boss won't be happy when he finds out you've kept him waiting... 
Tan Suit looks curious now. 
TAN SUIT Can I ask what this is about? 
DRIVER I have something that belongs to him. 
IRENE Where have you been?... 
He stares back at her in silence. 
IRENE I tried to reach you. Standard's been - 
DRIVER I know... 
His eyes stay on her, as if he's trying to tell her something more. She looks confused, staring back at him curiously when a small voice interrupts. 
BENICIO O/S Hey... 
Driver looks over at the little boy. 
DRIVER Hey... 
(CONTINUED) 104 CONTINUED: 104 
Irene begins to see the guilt in his eyes and slowly it hits her. She stares in disbelief, reeling. 
DRIVER I'm sorry about your father... 
Benicio nods. Driver keeps staring at the boy but can't find any more words of comfort. Irene watches him, still stunned. He looks back at her. 
IRENE I can't talk now. I have to go. 
DRIVER Can I give you a ride? 
She stares at him in dismay, close to tears. 
IRENE The car's working fine. 
DRIVER Then let me walk you down... 
She wants to say no but can't. 
105 INT. CORRIDOR/ APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 105 
Driver and Irene head down the long corridor in silence. 
IRENE (Almost a whisper) Why?... 
Driver misunderstands, thinking she's talking about Standard. 
DRIVER He was into one of the prison gangs for a lot of money. He was trying to protect you. 
IRENE Great job... 
She walks faster now, striding towards the elevator. Driver follows her. 
DRIVER I still have the money. Whatever you need - 
She turns around and slaps him hard. 
IRENE What are you, a bank? I work for a living. I don't need your widow's pension! 
(CONTINUED) 105 CONTINUED: 105 
Her eyes well up with tears, staring at him in anger and frustration. 
IRENE Just tell me one thing. How did he talk you into it? 
DRIVER He didn't talk me into anything. I've been doing this my whole life. It's what I do... 
She stares at him in deep disappointment. 
IRENE Stupid me... 
She turns away when the elevator bell rings. The doors open, revealing TAN SUIT. Neither Driver or Irene recognizes him but we do. He smiles, pretending to look confused. 
TAN SUIT Sorry, I'm supposed to be going down... 
IRENE So are we... 
The glass splinters with blood, the force of the blow shattering Tan Suit's skull. 
Driver looks around for Irene now and sees her standing in the elevator, framed against the light. 
She stares back at him, but makes no attempt to step out. 
Driver stands there, his hands covered in Tan Suit's blood. The elevator doors finally close, hiding Irene from view. 
108 OMITTED 108 
108a EXT. LA STREET - NIGHT. 108a 
Shannon gets out of his car. Driver is waiting for him by his own car, silhouetted against the streetlight. Shannon stares at him a moment, then notices the blood stains on his shirt. 
(CONTINUED) 108a CONTINUED: 108a 
SHANNON What happened? 
DRIVER Nino's guys came after me. How did they know about Irene? 
Shannon takes a moment to reply, looking dazed. 
SHANNON I called Bernie...I asked if he could help. Him and Nino are like brothers. I told him you weren't interested in the money, that you only did it for the girl... (From the heart) I wanted to make sure once you returned the money that was the end of it... 
Driver doesn't seem to hear him. 
SHANNON Let me talk to Bernie again. They probably didn't listen to him - 
DRIVER It's too late... 
Shannon says nothing now, knowing he's right. 
DRIVER They're gonna come after you to find me. You have to leave... 
Shannon takes this in slowly. 
SHANNON What are you gonna do?... 
Driver doesn't answer, but from his silence Shannon can guess. 
SHANNON How the fuck did this happen? We're supposed be in Charlotte or Daytona drinking champagne out of trophies and getting laid by pit lizards... 
He stares at Driver with quiet regret. 
SHANNON Fuck... 
109 OMITTED 109 
110 INT. NINO'S PIZZERIA - MORNING. 110 
Bernie Rose looks quietly furious. 
BERNIE ROSE ...I already gave you my advice. You should have taken your money and left this guy alone. 
Nino and Cook sit opposite him, both of Cook's hands broken now. 
NINO It's not that simple, Bernie. 
BERNIE ROSE Not now that it's bounced up in your face. 
COOK Mr. Paolozzi, I owe you this guy. Just give me the okay and I'll - 
BERNIE ROSE You like taking orders, go shut the blinds. 
He looks at Cook's broken hands. 
BERNIE ROSE Sun's in my eyes... 
Nino doesn't look at Cook, a clear indication he should do as he's told. Cook stands up, humiliated, and walks over to the windows. Bernie Rose waits for Nino to explain. 
NINO ...The money belonged to a half assed wiseguy from Philly. I had a tip-off he was keeping a million in a pawn shop and was gonna invest it here in LA, try to run a rival operation. I wanted to teach him a lesson... 
The lights in the restaurant gradually fade as Cook shuts the blinds. 
Cook's not dead yet, just writhing on the floor, choking on his own blood. Bernie Rose keeps his eyes fixed on Nino. 
BERNIE ROSE Your turn to clean up after me... 
110a EXT. TRAILER/ FILM SET/ SAN PEDRO/ LOS ANGELES - MORNING. 110a 
The CREW are setting up for their first shot of the day. In the background we see a DIRECTOR blocking out an action scene. Driver walks past without even a glance, heading towards the make-up trailer. He opens the door and walks in, looking around the trailer until he finds what he's looking for -- the SFX mask he saw previously on the film set. 
111 INT. SHANNON'S GARAGE/ SILVERLAKE BOULEVARD - MORNING. 111 
Shannon limps down the steps from his office with a suitcase in his hand. He heads into the main garage then suddenly stops. Bernie Rose stands beside the stock car, waiting for him. 
BERNIE ROSE All these priceless cars, you should get better locks... 
SHANNON Door's always open to you... 
Bernie Rose heads towards him with his hands in his coat pockets. 
BERNIE ROSE Going somewhere? 
SHANNON Thinking about it. 
(CONTINUED) 111 CONTINUED: 111 
BERNIE ROSE I'm looking for your driver. 
SHANNON You break in like this I figure it's bad news. 
BERNIE ROSE It's bad luck. Two thousand heists in this city a year, he had to pick the wrong one. 
SHANNON He tried to put it right. 
BERNIE ROSE Picked the wrong guy for that too. My partner's a belligerent asshole with his back against the wall... 
He stops, facing Shannon. 
BERNIE ROSE Right now so am I. I don't take care of this I'm in big trouble... 
He stares at his old friend. 
BERNIE ROSE Any idea where he is? 
SHANNON Probably across the border by now. Mexico. Belize. That's where I'd go... 
Bernie Rose smiles, not believing a word. 
BERNIE ROSE He just walked out on you after everything you've done for him, took all the money? 
SHANNON That's gratitude, I guess. 
Bernie Rose can't help grinning, fond of Shannon despite everything. 
BERNIE ROSE I ever tell you how long Izzy and I been friends? Since we were six. Only Jews in a neighborhood of wops. Long as I can remember he was getting me into trouble and I was getting him out of scrapes... 
He looks almost apologetic. 
(CONTINUED) 111 CONTINUED: (2) 111 
BERNIE ROSE Anyone else I'd take your side... 
SHANNON Anyone else I'd do the same... 
Bernie Rose watches him with a mixture of affection and regret. 
BERNIE ROSE What's this fucking kid to you anyway? 
Shannon shrugs, no idea himself. 
BERNIE ROSE I leave here without finding out where he is, there'll be others coming after me. I guarantee they'll be too stupid to figure out you won't talk and drag this out unnecessarily... 
SHANNON Then I'm glad you got here first... 
Bernie Rose holds his gaze, then looks away, admiring the shiny stock car. 
In the front seat Nino's chauffeur checks his mirror curiously. 
NINO When this is over I'll make it up to you, I swear... 
The lights of the car behind have vanished. 
147 EXT. AERIAL VIEW/ PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 147 
Even from above we can't see Driver's car with its lights off - no idea how close it is to Nino's car. 
148 INT. BERNIE ROSE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT. 148 
Even though he's still angry, Bernie can't help forgiving his childhood friend. 
BERNIE ROSE How many times I heard that before... 
149 INT. NINO'S CAR/ PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 149 
Nino grins. 
NINO I lost count - 
Suddenly blazing headlights explode to life behind him. 
150 INT. DRIVER'S CAR/ PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 150 
Driver rams the Lincoln at over a hundred miles an hour, hitting it just above the left rear wheel. 
151 EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 151 
The impact is momentous. The huge Continental is lifted up in the air and spun round at the same time. It slams back into the tarmac then flips end over end for a hundred yards. 
152 INT. BERNIE ROSE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT. 152 
Bernie Rose is left holding the phone as the line goes dead. 
153 INT. DRIVER'S CAR/ PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 153 
The collision has barely knocked Driver off course. His car skids to a stop near the overturned wreck. 
154 INT. NINO'S CAR/ PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 154 
Among the carnage, we see Nino, bloodied but still alive. He unbuckles his seat belt and crawls out of the twisted wreck. 
155 EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 155 
Driver gets out of his car, calmly walking over to the pulverized Lincoln. He sees Nino stumbling off towards the beach but doesn't hurry after him yet. He checks to make sure the other passengers are dead, then heads on. 
156 EXT. BEACH/ OCEAN/ PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 156 
Nino stumbles through the sand, running for his life now. He looks behind him and sees Driver calmly pursuing him. He keeps running, but he's badly injured, slowing all the time. Fear clouds reason and he staggers towards the crashing waves. 
Driver slows down as he watches the gangster wade into the ocean, a pathetic last attempt to evade him. The crashing waves and the undertow are an impenetrable wall. Every time Nino tries to wade out further, the ocean drags him back. 
(CONTINUED) 156 CONTINUED: 156 
Driver stares at his trapped prey. Nino's attempts become more and more feeble as the ocean exhausts him and snuffs out any hope of escape. Finally he retreats back into the shallow water, barely able to keep his footing. He turns around and faces Driver, the crashing waves still smashing into his back. 
They stay like that for a moment. Gazing at each other. Driver silhouetted against the white sand. Nino trapped in the ocean. Then Driver wades out into the water. Nino has no fight left in him, staring at the masked man. Driver stares back at him then grabs him by the throat, forcing his head under the water. Nino splutters as Driver lets him up again. 
NINO It was Bernie...Bernie Rose killed your friend not me... 
Driver shoves his face back under the water, keeping it there until Nino's body finally stops thrashing. 
157 INT. BERNIE ROSE'S APARTMENT/ BEL AIR - NIGHT. 157 
A phone shrills. Bernie Rose answers it. 
BERNIE ROSE Nino? 
DRIVER'S VOICE ON THE PHONE He's dead. 
Bernie Rose stares out in silence. Whatever he thinks of Nino, a part of him has died. We feel the regret in his eyes but there's no trace of emotion in his voice. 
He smiles again, looking into Driver's eyes with just a hint of sympathy. 
BERNIE ROSE This is what I'll do for you. You give me the money, nobody knows she exists. But it's a different matter with you. (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 160 CONTINUED: (2) 160 BERNIE ROSE (cont'd) These people I have the misfortune to be involved with, they don't mind Nino being gone, but they'll wanna know what happened to him... 
DRIVER Sounds like we have a problem... 
BERNIE ROSE And just when we were getting to know each other... 
Their eyes are fixed on each other, deadly enemies but kindred spirits of a kind. 
BERNIE ROSE ...We shake hands, say goodbye, it's the start of your new life. Sooner or later they'll come after you. No end to it. Someone gets tired, somebody else takes their place. It goes on and on. Whatever dreams you have, whatever plans, you might as well forget `em, because this is what it's gonna be like till the day you die... (A BEAT) I just thought you should know... 
Driver stares back at him quietly. 
DRIVER What do you suggest I do? 
BERNIE ROSE First time I heard about you, Shannon told me you drove. Fast. That's a start... 
He keeps staring at Driver, then smiles. 
BERNIE ROSE Either that or you choke on the duck... 
161 EXT. PARKING LOT/ LINCOLN BOULEVARD - DAY. 161 
Driver's car is parked at the back of the parking lot, half hidden by a fenced area for garbage. Driver pops the trunk, taking out the black gym bag with the cash. Bernie Rose doesn't even look at it, still admiring the car. 
BERNIE ROSE How much does something like this cost? 
DRIVER Nine, ten thousand. If you can find one that still runs. 
(CONTINUED) 161 CONTINUED: 161 
BERNIE ROSE Maybe I'll take yours. Part of our deal. 
He grins, then holds out his hand for the gym bag. 
BERNIE ROSE Guess we won't be seeing each other again.. 
Driver reaches out to give him the bag, when suddenly Bernie's hand snakes out of his pocket, twisting a switch-blade into Driver's gut. He pulls it out, ready to stab again, but this time Driver catches his wrist, slowly forcing the knife up to his throat. 
Their eyes are fixed on each other for a moment, with something like regret, then the blade pierces Bernie Rose's neck, sinking deeper and deeper. Driver holds the old man in his arms as he dies. They stay like that, locked in a fatal embrace, then Driver lowers Bernie Rose gently to the ground, out of sight. 
Blood seeping through his shirt, Driver picks up the gym bag and puts it back in the trunk, slamming the door shut. 
162 EXT. AERIAL VIEW OF A MUCH LARGER PARKING LOT/ LA - DAY. 162 
We're looking down on an enormous parking lot, hundreds of different colored vehicles gleaming down below. Driver pulls into the lot, searching for a place to park. 
163 EXT. LARGE PARKING LOT/ LA - DAY. 163 
Driver climbs out of his car, wearing a jacket over his blood- soaked shirt. He walks to the back of the car, kneels down, and hides the keys behind the left rear wheel, drops of blood dripping on the tarmac beneath him. He gets up again, then sets off through the maze of parked vehicles, dialling a number on his cell-phone. 
164 EXT. ECHO PARK - DAY. 164 
Irene and Benicio sit in the park. 
IRENE (Picking up her phone) Hello?...

The blazing sun beats down. Driver walks through a long corridor of glinting cars. 
DRIVER It's me...

Irene stares in surprise. 
DRIVER'S VOICE ON THE PHONE Don't hang up... 
She says nothing but stays on the line.

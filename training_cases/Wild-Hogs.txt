REVISED 7/06/05 
FADE IN: 
INT. KITCHEN - MORNING 
ANGLE ON: BILLY MATTHEWS, 8, ravenously eating a plate of hashbrowns, runny fried eggs and syrupy waffles. 
WOMAN'S VOICE (O.C.) Doug?... We see DOUG MATTHEWS, 40's, sitting across the table, staring at his son, Billy. Doug is handsome in that honest, sincere way. A guy you would call to help you move a couch. He watches Billy scoop up his hashbrowns with a frosted pop-tart. Billy catches his Dad's look and grins with his mouth full. Doug smiles back, then looks down at his own plate. He has scrambled egg whites and sliced tomatoes. His smile fades away. 
WOMAN'S VOICE (O.C.) (CONT'D) Doug? Doug snaps out of it and looks up at his wife, KELLY MATTHEWS. She's attractive, with a patient smile. 
KELLY I've got some stuff to do for the party tomorrow. Can you take Billy to school? 
DOUG What "stuff"? This party isn't going to be fancy, is it? Just some friends and a wing platter from Costco? 
KELLY It's a our 10th anniversary, Doug. Its going to be a nice party with nice food and nice music. And wings have carbs, so you can't eat them anyway. 
BILLY 
(MOUTH FULL) I'll eat 'em. Doug gives Billy a look. 
DOUG No you won't. Because I'm going to scrape the batter off. 
BILLY That doesn't work. 
"Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 2. 
DOUG I went to medical school. You think I don't know how carbs work? 
BILLY Dentists go to medical school? Doug looks a little insulted. 
KELLY Doug, can you take Billy or not? 
DOUG Yeah, I can take him. There aren't any emergencies at the office this morning. 
KELLY You have emergencies? 
DOUG 
(INDIGNANT) Yes, I have emergencies. That's what my pager is for. one beep from that thing, and bam. I'm off. Like a cheetah. Billy, now pouring lucky charms into a bowl, looks up. 
BILLY 
(MOUTH FULL) The battery ith gone in that thing. You took them out for the TV clicker. Doug gives Billy a look. 
DOUG I did do that. I forgot about that. I need to get some batteries in there. Because dentists do have emergencies. We are doctors, you know? We take the same oath. The oath of saving lives. Doug goes to take some of Billy's discarded Lucky Charms. Billy swats his hand away. 
BILLY 
(MOUTH FULL) Uh uh. Carbth. Doug nods, defeated, as Billy hops up and dumps the remaining lucky charms in the trash.

INT. VOLVO - LATER THAT MORNING 
DOUG drives a Volvo station wagon along the streets of Cincinnati. BILLY is next to him, in the passenger seat, looking bored. Doug notices. 
DOUG You know, I use to race a car like this. Put a hemi under the hood... Nobody saw me coming. 
BILLY Really? 
DOUG Yup. It could really... smoke some ass. Billy raises his eyebrows, impressed. Doug smiles. This was a good time to break the "no saying ass" rule. 
DOUG (CONT'D) Yes, sir. They called it the dragon wagon. You're lucky to be in here without a helmet, pal. We both are. Doug downshifts a gear, and the tame engine roars artificially. Billy is impressed. 
BILLY Awesome! Hey, can I jam the radio? 
BOB You bought this shirt for me. I was fine with my t-shirts-- 
KAREN Oh, you don't like the shirt now? Fine. Take it off. 
BOB What? 
KAREN Take it off! You don't want to wear nice things, don't. Off! Bob sighs and takes the shirt off. Karen snatches it from him. 
KAREN (CONT'D) Now take Claire to her ballet class. It's starts in five minutes. 
BOB Well, I have to get another-- 
KAREN Go! Five minutes! Karen pushes Bob out the door, with Claire skipping happily behind him. 
INT. BOB'S CAR - A MOMENT LATER 
Bob sits in the car, SHIRTLESS, next to Claire. He looks over at her, and notices a pink hoodie in her lap. 
BOB You going to wear that? 
CLAIRE For five dollars, I'm not. Bob sighs and reaches for his wallet. 
"Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 7. 
INT. CHILDREN'S DANCE STUDIO - FIVE MINUTES LATER 
A bunch of kids in dance leotards are starting a class. Claire comes running into the group, as Bob enters behind her, wearing the pink hoodie. It's way too small, and doesn't quite cover his belly. He sits with the parents and nods awkwardly to them. It's embarrassing. 
FADE TO BLACK: 
FADE BACK IN ON: 
INT. MODERN HOUSE - MORNING 
We see the pristine living room of an expensive, architectural house. 
MALE VOICE (O.C.) Woody. 
(GETTING ANGRY) Woody Stevens! We see WOODY STEVENS, 40s, handsome, but with shifty eyes and a Michael Keaton hairline, walk through the stylish house speaking into a cordless headset. 
WOODY .No, you listen to me. You're not going to push me around. We agreed on a price, and that's the price I'll pay. If you don't like it, walk away... but you can kiss your business good bye, because that's what happens when you screw with Woody Stevens. You go down. Hard. As Woody talks, he passes by framed magazine covers of a beautiful model, (CLAUDIA) as well as some pictures of his wedding day with her, their exotic vacations, and one blownup glamour shot of Woody, shirtless, oiled and holding a greasy wrench. 
WOODY (CONT'D) .No, money's not the problem (LAUGHS) Money's never a problem. You just need to honor the correct price. Got it? Woody gets his answer, and angrily throws the headset down on a stack of moving boxes. He marches to the front door and throws it open. 
"Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 8. 
EXT. WOODY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
Woody yells out the front door. 
WOODY .Then go home, Toby! You make me sick! ANGLE ON: The front yard. A ten-year-old boy is standing with a rake, surrounded by leaves. He clicks off his cellphone and shrugs. 
TOBY I can't do this many leaves for ten bucks! It'll take two hours! 
WOODY Well, you should have thought of that before you put the "any yard for ten bucks" flyer on the telephone pole. You're done on this block, now. And that goes for your band fund-raisers, too. I'm not buying any candy bars no matter what parade you dorks have to get to! Woody slams the door closed. Toby kicks at a pile of leaves, then starts home. 
FADE OUT: 
FADE BACK IN ON: 
INT. CLUTTERED OFFICE - MORNING 
We see an office crowded with disassembled Apple computers, motherboards, and abandoned monitors. 
COMPUTER VOICE Dudley? ANGLE ON: DUDLEY FRANK (late 30s), an odd-looking, curly- haired guy with black plastic glasses that are slightly too big for his face. He stares at a computer in front of him. 
DUDLEY Yeah, hey, Mac. How's it go-- 
COMPUTER VOICE It is now nine o'clock am. 
"Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 9. 
DUDLEY Thanks, Mac. Open internet, okay? A pause. 
COMPUTER VOICE Command unknown. 
"Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 12. 
DANA That's what I thought. Thank God you got here. 
DOUG Yeah. 
(BEAT) Well, let's send him over to an Orthopedic surgeon. 
DANA Absolutely. Thanks, doctor. Doug nods. He looks around for something else to do, but there's nothing. He moves a dental tool away from the edge of a tray, smiles politely and exits. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. DOUG'S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - LATER THAT AFTERNOON 
DOUG, looking depressed, pulls into the driveway. He looks over and sees BILLY and three of his friends shooting baskets. He smiles, gets out of the car and struts over. 
DOUG 
(TO KIDS) Yo! Matthews is open. Billy looks up and cringes a little bit, but passes the ball to DOUG. Doug dribbles it under his leg and charges the basket. 
DOUG (CONT'D) Taking it into the paint. Who's got the D? Whoop, too late, dudes! Booya! Doug jumps up to slam the ball, but only hammers it into the rim. The rim clangs loudly and the ball goes flying backwards. Billy's friends laugh a little. Doug notices. 
DOUG (CONT'D) Well, that's not really my shot. I usually hit from downtown, you know? Doug grabs the ball out of the bushes and dribbles back to the three point line. 
"Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 13. 
DOUG (CONT'D) That's where the big games get won. Back here from the three-- Doug swivels, jumps up and releases the ball. It heads towards the basket, then falls down five feet before it. It looks more like a pass than a shot. Billy hangs his head, humiliated. 
DOUG (CONT'D) That was a pass, dudes! It wasn't. Doug nods with false confidence to the kids, stands there awkwardly for a moment, then quietly heads inside. 
INT. DOUG'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - A MOMENT LATER 
DOUG enters and finds KELLY. She smiles and kisses him. 
KELLY Hey, honey. Snack? Kelly hands Doug a sandwich bag of celery. He looks over to the table, where Kelly has laid out Ritz crackers covered in cheez whiz, for the kids. Doug puts the bag of celery down. 
DOUG I'm okay. I think I'm just going to go meet the guys for a beer. 
KELLY 
Okay. Lite beer, if you want to stick to that diet. 
DOUG 
Right. Yes. Lite beer. No carbs. Just delicious beer... water. Doug smiles and heads upstairs. Kelly looks concerned. 
CUT TO: 
INT. DOUG'S BEDROOM - A MOMENT LATER 
Doug enters his bedroom and shuts the door behind him. He sits down on the bed and lets out a long sigh. 
"Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 14. After a moment, he gets up and walks over to the closet. He opens it and we see: A leather biker jacket, leather chaps, boots, gloves, a black "half-helmet," etc. For the first time, we see a genuine smile come over Doug's face. 
MUSIC CUE: IGGY POP'S "REAL WILD ONE (WILD CHILD)" 
EXT. DOUG'S DRIVEWAY - A FEW MINUTES LATER 
The garage door on Doug's house rolls open like a theater curtain, and Doug, wearing the full leather biker getup, idles out of the garage on a gleaming, chromed-out Harley Davidson Fatboy. He looks around the neighborhood cockily, smiles, then kicks the bike into gear and rides into the street. The camera rotates around him and comes to rest on the back of his jacket, where we see a large patch that reads "Wild Hogs." The camera ZOOMS IN ON THIS, and it becomes: 
TITLE CARD 
MUSIC CUE CONTINUES OVER FOLLOWING SCENES: 
EXT. BOB LEVENSTEIN'S HOUSE - SAME TIME 
BOB creeps through the living room. From the kitchen, we can hear KAREN, HALEY and CLAIRE screaming things at him, about him, etc. He just tip-toes to the hall closet and opens the door. We don't see what's in it, but see Bob smile the same way Doug did, and... 
SMASH CUT TO: 
EXT. BOB'S DRIVEWAY - A MINUTE LATER 
BOB, in leather biker gear, rolls out of his garage on another shimmering Harley Davidson. He looks around through his mirrored aviator sunglasses like a complete bad ass. He looks down the street and spots DOUG, riding towards him. Bob rides down the driveway and joins alongside Doug. They nod silently to each other and tap fists like the toughest guys in the world. We see Bob is also wearing a "Wild Hogs" jacket. 
EXT. WOODY'S HOUSE - SAME TIME 
DOUG Hey! She took an embroidery class for those. What has your wife ever made us? 
BOB 
(QUIETLY) Hard. 
WOODY Hey!? 
BOB Sorry. I didn't... Don't tell her. 
DOUG It's not a big secret, Bob. She's a swimsuit model. She's hot. I mean, so is my Kelly. She's very hot. Even after ten years. Not that I'm not still good looking... Doug looks at the guys. They don't respond. 
WOODY We're not going to say you're hot, man. 
DOUG Because it's gay, or because I'm not? 
WOODY There's no non-gay response to that. 
DUDLEY 
(TO DOUG) If I were a girl, I'd be attracted to you. 
WOODY Point proven. 
BOB Well, Kelly must still think you're hot. Ten years, man. How's that feel? 
DOUG I don't know. Good, I guess. Is ten the silver anniversary? 
DUDLEY No, that's the 25th. Ten is aluminum. 
"Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 19. 
DOUG Aluminum? Like, siding? (considers, then) Yeah, that feels about right. Aluminum is sturdy, lightweight... recycled. Woody smiles and puts a map down on the table. 
WOODY --And ready for the trip of a lifetime. The guys look at the map, puzzled. 
DOUG We don't need a map for Daytona. We just follow the group. Woody takes a drink from his beer, then looks at the group with a mischievous fire behind his eyes. 
WOODY Not if we don't go on the Daytona trip. 
DOUG What? 
DUDLEY Noooo!! 
WOODY Guys, listen to me. It's time for a change. Let's go on our own trip this year. Just us, like it was in college. Forget these guys. Forget Daytona beach. Bike Week is just corporate white guys playing dress up. This bar is, too. And we didn't get into this to play dress up - we got in this to live. "Be cool and Ride free." That's the Wild Hog creed. 
DOUG No, it's not. It's the slogan for the Downtown trolley. 
WOODY I know. But, it works as our creed, too. So let's live it! 
DUDLEY But, I boogie board in Daytona. Can't our creed be "Be cool and boogie board?" 
"Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 20. 
WOODY No. That's dumb, Dudley. Let the big people talk. 
DOUG Well, what kind of trip are you suggesting? Another bike week somewhere? 
WOODY No. That's the best part. We don't do some planned out trip. We follow the open road. U.S. 50. The backbone of America. We take a week and go all the way to San Francisco. Think about it, guys. Camping out, stopping wherever we want, whenever we want... Just freedom. When was the last time we had that? The guys consider this, but look sceptical. 
BOB I don't know, man. 
WOODY You're afraid to ask your wife. 
BOB 
(COVERING) No... 
WOODY 
(TO DOUG) What do you think? 
DOUG Well, Daytona isn't the "backbone of America," but it is a tradition. We've been riding with this club for years. Do we really want to miss out on that? One of the bikers, KENT, approaches carrying a box. 
KENT Hey, dudes. Check these out. Kent holds up a sleeveless t-shirt with a big cartoon guy on a motorcycle - with the words "Born to Be Wild! Daytona ride, 2005." It's horrifying. 
She sees this is landing on him. He's getting upset. 
ROGER (CONT'D) But, not anymore. He's now become the son-in-law I would have always hoped for. Responsible, reliable, and a great husband to my daughter. So cheers to-- 
DOUG No, no. No cheers-- Because that wasn't an accurate toast. I'm still the same, shitty son-in-law I used to be. 
The guests laugh. They think he's joking. 
ROGER 
Come on, Doug. You should be proud! 
You've grown up! Cheers! 
The guests nod and clink their glasses. Doug shakes his 
head. 
DOUG 
Grown up? No, I haven't. I'm still 
young. No cheers! Stop clinking! 
KELLY 
Doug, stop it. You're being rude. 
DOUG 
Well, tell them I'm the same as I used to 
be, Kelly. Tell your Dad not to like me. 
KELLY You're not the same, Doug. The old Doug wouldn't have made fun of Fred Milton for dancing, because he would have been out there dancing himself. With me. 
"Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 24. 
DOUG So what are you saying? 
KELLY I'm saying you have changed. And frankly, i don't like it. I like you the way you were. I liked it when you weren't afraid of looking stupid. I liked it when we laughed. I liked it when we danced. 
DOUG Hey, I'll dance! It's just this music is lame. People like me need a fresh beat! Doug walks over to the stereo and changes the station. "Cand Sho " h y-50 Cent starts playing. Doug nods along with the beat, as the guests all now stare at him. 
DOUG (CONT'D) (yelling over music) Awwww, yeah. This is the shit! It ain't 1980 anymore, man. Yeah! 
(SINGS ALONG) I take you to the... Andy shop-- Doug tries to confidently sing along, but struggles awkwardly, as he's obviously never heard the song before. 
KELLY (urging, to Doug) Honey, stop it. You're being an ass. 
DOUG What!? I thought this was what you wanted? I'm dancing! Doug starts grinding and shimmying to the beat. Kelly grits her teeth. 
DOUG (CONT'D) Come on, baby! Just because we're married ten years doesn't mea n we're old people. Let's dance! It fee ls goooood! Doug makes another spastic dance move, then suddenly grimaces and grabs his chest. 
DOUG (CONT'D) Nope, that feels bad-- 
KELLY Doug? What's wrong? Are you okay? 
"Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 25. 
DOUG Yeah. I'm just-- Ow: That's-- Yeah, I should go to the hospital-- Doug staggers across the carpet as people run to help him. 
KELLY Doug!? 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - AN HOUR LATER 
Doug is in a bed, with Kelly next to him. A DOCTOR enters with a chart. 
DOCTOR Well, Mr. Matthews-- 
DOUG Dr. Matthews, actually. 
DOCTOR Oh, really? Great. Then, I can say this a lot easier. You had a hypertensive myocardial seizure. Doug nods confidently, then, after a moment: 
DOUG Really? (considers, then) I only got you an ankle bracelet. 
"Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 28. 
KELLY All I want is old Doug back. Please. This marriage can't survive without him. Doug takes this in, and smiles at her. She's a good wife, and he knows it. Suddenly, BOB enters the room. 
BOB Doug! Are you okay? 
DOUG Yeah, I'm okay. Just stress. 
BOB Oh, man. Thank god. 
KELLY 
(TO BOB) Where's Karen? 
BOB Oh, she's waiting in the parking-- SFX: A loud honk from the parking lot. 
BOB (CONT'D) That's her. Bob looks out the window nervously. Kelly looks at Doug. 
KELLY You all need this trip. Doug gives her a knowing nod, then turns to Bob. 
DOUG Bob. Let's forget about Daytona Bike week. Let's ride across U.S. 50. 
BOB Yeah? Are you sure? I mean, We'll be leaving behind everything we're used to. SFX: The horn honks again from outside. 
KAREN (O.C.) (yelling from parking lot) Bob!? You said two minutes! I'm not circling!! Bob cringes. Doug shares a look with Kelly, then to Bob: 
"Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 29. 
DOUG Yeah. I think that might be okay. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. STREET - THE NEXT WEEK 
DOUG is riding his Harley, which is loaded with gear (sleeping bag, spare gas tank, saddle bags). He approaches a freeway entrance ramp, where WOODY and DUDLEY and BOB are waiting on their bikes, next to an entrance ramp sign that reads: U.S. Highway 50. The guys all tap fists, then notice Dudley is grinning ear to ear. 
WOODY 
(TO DUDLEY) What? What's wrong with you? 
DUDLEY I got a tat. 
BOB A tattoo? You got a tattoo? 
DUDLEY I'm a biker, dude! I got a tat! Dudley yanks his jacket down to his elbows and we see he is wearing a sleeveless shirt underneath. On his bicep is a tattoo of the Macintosh Apple. The guys nod, trying to look impressed. 
DOUG Wow. That's... 
DUDLEY Trademarked, I know. But what are they going to do? It's in my skin, bitch! Dudley laughs and pulls on his jacket, as Woody ties a bandana skull-cap on his head. The guys look at Woody. 
DOUG You're not wearing a helmet? 
WOODY Nape. I don't want anything between me and the road, man. 
DOUG You will if your head falls on it. 
"Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 30. Woody shrugs and starts his bike. 
WOODY Look, the only rule on this trip is to have no plan. We're riding to San Francisco, and nothing else is planned. Just riding free. 
DOUG Well, if we're going to make it in five days, we'll should probably get to Illinois by tonight. 
BOB Yeah, the way I mapped it out - we should be a hundred miles past St. Louis by sundown. 
WOODY What? No. No plan. It's the open road. Who knows where we'll be. 
DOUG I do. I have this little GPS system. Doug shows them a handheld GPS system. Woody grabs it and throws it into a storm drain. 
DOUG (CONT'D) Hey! What the hell, man? That was expensive! 
WOODY I did it for the good of the trip, Doug. You don't need GPS to discover America. We just need the wind, our bikes, and freedom. And if we have an emergency, I always have a cell phone-- Woody takes out a cellphone. Doug grabs it and throws it in the storm drain. 
DOUG Hah! How's that feel? Woody gives Doug a long look, then slowly smiles. 
WOODY (yells after him) Don't hang it on a tree! 
DOUG Yup... These are the times we'll remember. After a minute, Doug turns to Woody and Bob. 
"Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 34. 
DOUG (CONT'D) Hey, when was the last time you guys heard me sing Bon Jovi? 
WOODY Oh, man. Thank God that stopped. 
BOB It's been awhile. You're not as obnoxious as you used to be. You used to eat a lot more buffalo wings, too. 
DOUG Yeah, I know. Turns out there's carbs in the batter. Hey, you know what? Maybe carbs are what I need to get old Doug back. 
WOODY Old Doug? You've lost your Dad? 
DOUG No. I think I've lost me. It's this thing Kelly said. 
(BEAT) You know what it is? I think I'm tame. I'm like a lion that used to be wild, but now I'm in some Disney park where tourists come by and take pictures of me like I'm a lion, but after they leave, I go into my kennel and eat antelope nuggets or something. Ones without carbs. 
BOB I know what you're talking about. I lost old Bob, too. I think my wife and daughters killed him. I'm surrounded by women every minute of my life. And it's made me, you know... 
DOUG A wimp? 
BOB What? No. I was going to say miserable. You think I'm a wimp? 
DOUG No. I just thought that was what you were... I thought you wanted us to guess, and I didn't have a guess, so I said "wimp." Knowing it was wrong... 
"Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 35. 
WOODY You're a wimp, Bob. I'll say it. You're afraid of girls. It's embarrassing. Dudley comes up and sits back down. 
DUDLEY I'm afraid of girls. 
WOODY You're afraid to talk to one. Bob is afraid they'll kill him in his sleep. 
DUDLEY Wow. Now I really don't want to talk to one. 
BOB You know, it's not always so bad. Like, when Karen sleeps, she still crawls over and pushes up against me. Just snuggles right up like she needs me. I like that. I like that a lot. (then, sobering) Then the sun comes up and turns her into a raging she-demon. 
DOUG Yeah, I guess life just isn't as simple as it was when we were in college. Well, except for you, Woody. You're still living the fairy tale. Swimsuit model wife. Big job at an investment firm. You've got the good life. Woody doesn't respond. He just stares vacantly into the fire for a beat. 
WOODY 
(FLATLY) Yeah... The good life. I'm a lucky man. 
DUDLEY My life blows. I don't have a family. Or a wife. I have a cat that doesn't like me. She wouldn't even stick around if she knew how to use a can opener. The guys all look at Dudley. 
BOB Hey, Dudley. You've got us, buddy. And you're going to get a woman, too. 
(MORE) 
"Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 36 
BOB (CONT'D) I told you we were going to hit some strip clubs when we get back. 
DUDLEY Nah, I don't like those places-- 
BOB Dudley-- Please. I'm trying to help you here. 
DUDLEY I know. I just don't-- 
BOB Please! Strippers are nice to me! 
DUDLEY Okay... Sorry. We'll go. 
BOB Thanks, man. 
(THEN) I'm just... trying to be a good friend. 
DOUG We know, Bob. 
WOODY I'll go, too. 
DOUG There's a surprise. Doug pulls a flaming marshmallow out of the fire. 
EXT. HIGHWAY U.S. 50 - LATER THAT DAY 
The guys ride through the forested Ozark uplands, looking even hotter than before. Doug spots a waterfall pouring into a crystal clear spring, and points to it. The guys nod in agreement. 
CUT TO: 
"Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 40. 
EXT. BLANCHARD SPRINGS, OZARK NATIONAL FOREST - LATER 
DOUG, WOODY, and DUDLEY wade into the spring water in their boxers. You can see on their faces that it's like dipping into heaven. After a moment, BOB walks up. 
BOB Thanks for waiting for me, jerks. The guys look up to see that Bob is naked. He smiles and cannonballs into the water. 
BOB (CONT'D) Whhheew: Yeah! That's c-c-cold: He sees DOUG, WOODY and DUDLEY are just staring at him. 
BOB (CONT'D) What? 
WOODY Why are you naked? 
BOB We're swimming. You guys kept on your skivies? 
DOUG Skivies? What are you, a Newsie? 
DUDLEY I kept mine on because I didn't want everyone to see my crank. 
WOODY 
(TO BOB) Yeah. That, and being naked with a bunch of guys is gay. What's wrong with you? 
BOB I don't know. We took showers and stuff together in college. I thought this was kind of... you know, the same. 
DOUG I guess I get that. 
(THINKS) I mean, we would have been naked in college. Why are we... Oh, man. It's true. We are tamed. We're old guys. 
"Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 41. 
WOODY No, we're not. Don't say that. Doug wiggles his boxers off and holds them in the air. 
DOUG I will find old Doug! Doug smiles and throws his shorts on the shore. Dudley smiles, takes off his briefs and holds them up. 
DUDLEY I will... Do what Doug does! Dudley throws the briefs to shore. They all look at Woody. He rolls his eyes and takes off his boxers. 
WOODY I will be naked with my gay friends, and if they look at my jock, I will kill them. Woody throws the boxers to shore. The guys all look at each other and smile. It's a nice moment. Until a family approaches. Doug looks at the other guys, wide-eyed, as a family with three young kids walks up with a picnic basket. The young kids run and jump into the water. The Dad of the family laughs and shakes his head. 
FAMILY DAD Hope you guys don't mind a little company. The mini-van was getting a 
LITTLE-- The Dad stops talking as he sees into the water... He realizes, then looks at his kids, concerned. 
DOUG Um... Well, we're just taking a dip. I 
UH-- 
WOODY There's a shallower spring up the path. The kids might like that even more... The Mom lays down a blanket and turns to the guys. The Dad is still staring, not sure what to do. 
"Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 42. 
FAMILY MOM 
(TO WOODY) Oh, no. These little squirts like to 
DIVE AND-- The Mom sees a glimmer of something through the water, and realizes. She suddenly looks very uncomfortable. 
FAMILY MOM (CONT'D) 
(VERY TENSE) Janey, Kyle, Holland. Out of the water. We're going to find a new spot. 
JANEY No, Mama. This place has little rocks 
THAT-- 
FAMILY MOM Get out of the damn water! Now! The kids climb out of the water and the parents hurry off with them down the path. After a moment of awkward silence, Doug looks at the guys. 
DOUG We should go. 
The guys happily cruise along the highway. We see WOODY look in his side-view mirror and notice a large, black plume of smoke back in the distance. A look of worry creeps over his face. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. MOTEL - THAT EVENING 
The guys pull up to a small motel, as the sun sets behind the wheat fields of Kansas. 
WOODY No, we're not stopping here. Riding at night is half the fun. Let's just keep-- 
DOUG --I can't feel my nuts, Woody. And Kelly still wants another kid. DOUG, BOB and DUDLEY head inside the motel office. 
WOODY (calling after Doug) So, adopt a kid. You already have two white ones, anyway. The guys ignore him. Woody looks back down the highway uneasily, then heads inside the motel office. 
EXT. BIKER BAR - SAME TIME 
JACK, and the other bikers stand by the smoldering pile of wood that was once their bar. OILCAN approaches Jack. 
OILCAN I got my old lady bringing some gas. We can get moving by nightfall. 
JACK 
(BOILING) Forget it. Those guys are long gone.

JACK (CONT'D) They're not stupid enough to stop until they're five hundred miles from here. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MOTEL ROOM - SAME TIME 
DOUG, BOB and DUDLEY are in their motel room. WOODY stands at the window, nervously looking outside. 
WOODY 
(TO GUYS) I just think it's just stupid to stop this soon, you know?... We can keep riding under the stars. All night. 
DOUG Woody, your headlight doesn't even work. 
WOODY You think I won't ride without light? I can feel the road. Let's go. I'll even race somebody. Who's racing me? 
DOUG Did you inhale exhaust fumes? Because something is happening to your brain. I think it might be retardation. 
WOODY I just want to ride. Let's go! 
DOUG Whatever, Corky. Doug shrugs Woody off and dials his cell phone. 
DOUG (CONT'D) 
(INTO PHONE) Hey, honey. It's me. Woody glares at Doug. 
WOODY You're calling Kelly? You're not aloud to call wives on a road trip. 
DOUG 
(TO WOODY) I can call my wife whenever I want. 
(INTO PHONE) Yeah. Woody. Good guess... 
(MORE) 
"Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 54. 
DOUG (CONT'D) Yeah, I'm having a great time. No old Doug, yet, but I haven't gotten sun- burned... Woody looks at Bob. 
WOODY You agree with me, right? 
BOB Yeah, I actually agree with you on this one. Let's not call wives. 
DOUG 
(INTO PHONE) Yeah, Bob agreed with him. Good guess again. Man, I really miss you. 
MAGGIE I'll take care of them, Daddy. (to guys, extra polite) Good morning. Maggie smiles. She has a radiant sweetness, even though she's scared to death. DUDLEY stares at her, captivated. He's in love. 
MAGGIE (CONT'D) where would you gentleman like to sit? 
DOUG Are there any booths open? All the people quickly jump out of their booths. 
BOB Wow. Everyone is so nice, here. The guys sit in one of the booths. Dudley hangs back, and struggles to talk to Maggie. 
DUDLEY 
(TO MAGGIE) Um... So? Dudley tries to think of something else to say, but can't. He nods awkwardly, then heads over to the booth. He sits down with the guys. 
"Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 58. 
DUDLEY (CONT'D) 
(TO GUYS) She's perfect. 
DOUG You like the waitress, huh? 
DUDLEY I wanted to say something funny to her, but I could only think of black jokes. Maggie, still very skittish, approaches the table. 
MAGGIE And what would you gentleman like today? Doug looks to the next table, where a man is enjoying french toast. 
DOUG Mmmm. I'll have what he's having. Maggie nods obediently and takes the man's plate. She slides it in front of Doug. 
DOUG (CONT'D) No, uh... I'll take a new one. He can keep his. 
MAGGIE Of course. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Maggie quickly puts it back on the man's table. 
DOUG Hey, it's okay. Really. 
WOODY Not a big deal. 
BOB 
(FAKING ANGRY) Yeah, just don't let it happen again! Bob hammers his fist on the table and laughs at his joke, but Maggie starts to cry. The guys suddenly look confused as she runs to the kitchen in tears. Bob looks back to the guys. 
BOB (CONT'D) Wow. That wasn't funny. 
"Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 59. 
DUDLEY It's hard to be funny without being racist. Doug is looking at the town's local paper, and smiles. 
DOUG Hey, guys. This block party tonight looks cool. Music, grilled corn, dollar beers, funnel cakes. 
DUDLEY Funnel cakes!? Let's stay here tonight! 
WOODY No, no, no, no. We have a schedule. San Francisco is waiting. 
BOB What schedule? You said we're taking this trip to live. Let's stick around and live a little. Have some small town fun! Woody goes to protest again, but Dudley stands up. 
DUDLEY 
(LOUDLY) Let's party all night in Lucas! 
BUD (O.C. From kitchen area) God Dammit! What'd we do to deserve this!? We ANGLE TO SEE: MAGGIE rush over to calm BUD down. Bud calms down, then hears another motorcycle engine roaring down the street. He looks out the window and shakes his head. 
BUD (CONT'D) Not another one of these assholes. A moment later, MURDOCK, a fat, grungy Hells Angel, enters the diner with a cocky swagger and has a seat at the bar. 
MURDOCK 
(TO BUD) Get me a beer, old man. And if it's not good, I'm going to smash it across your face. 
"Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 60. ANGLE ON: The WILD HOGS, watching from the table behind Murdock. 
DOUG (sotto, to the guys) Not another one of these assholes. Murdock hears this and whips around to see the Wild Hogs. 
MURDOCK What'd you say? 
DOUG Oh, I was actually referring to some guys we met at a bar about two hundred miles east of here. You're probably not 
AFFILIATED-- 
MURDOCK That's my gang. I'm on my way there now. 
Charley flips on the light in a neatly organized police garage. In the middle sits a sparkling, unridden Harley Davidson police bike. 
"Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 64. 
DOUG Wow. That's fantastic. 
BOB You ride this? 
CHARLEY Oh, no. The Hells Angels would take it to pieces if they ever saw me on it. I just keep it in here. Polish it and so forth. But I'd never let them see it. 
DOUG Those guys are that big of a problem, huh? 
CHARLEY Yeah. They ride into town a few times a month and get drunk, damage property... Basically turn the place upside down. 
DOUG And the police don't do anything? 
CHARLEY Well, It's a small town - and me and the Dooble brothers are the only law. And they're still pretty green. 
WOODY Can't you call a bigger town or something for backup? 
CHARLEY Yeah, I've done that a few times. But the gang is always gone by the time they get here. We've also tried wearing riot gear, which does protect you from being hit, but not from being dragged. Also, one of the Dooble brothers tried to throw tear gas, but the bottle exploded and blew off his ear. 
DUDLEY Ech. 
CHARLEY Yeah, he's hard to look at. 
(THEN) Anyway, we want you guys to stay at our hotel tonight on us... Seeing as you're the new town heroes and all. 
"wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 65. The guys look flattered. Except Woody. 
WOODY Oh, thanks, but we're actually moving on-- 
DOUG 
(TO DUDLEY) We'd be honored to stay. Thank you. Woody's looks at Doug in protest. Doug gives him a stern glare. 
CHARLEY And if you're not in a rush to leave in the morning-- We've got a great trout stream you might want to check out. 
DUDLEY Cool! Let's fish! Doug shrugs. 
DOUG Sure. Let's do it. 
WOODY Uh uh. No, I'm putting my foot down, here. I still get a vote on what we do, you know? And I want my vote. 
DOUG Okay. Of course you get a vote. Woody nods and looks at Bob and Dudley. They clearly intend to stay. 
WOODY I actually get three votes. Because I planned the trip. 
DOUG But you didn't plan the voting system. I did. So you only get one. Sorry. Doug, Bob and Dudley walk off. Woody fumes. 
WOODY You know what? Old Doug wasn't such a douchebag! 
"Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 66. 
EXT. BIKER BAR - SAME TIME 
MURDOCK has arrived at the bar, which is just a burned shack at this point. The Hell's Angels are gathered around, watching JACK beat the crap out of a remaining wall with a pipe. He finally stops when the wall has crumbled. 
JACK Those assholes think they can cross the Hells Angels? Do you know how bad they've made us all look!? The gang nods. They all look pissed. 
JACK (CONT'D) Those guys have some balls. Balls I will put in my mouth and chew on!! The gang looks at Jack with a slight smile. OILCAN chuckles. 
OILCAN You're going to put balls in your mouth? The gang laughs. Jack realizes what the joke is... 
JACK No! I'm not-- I'm going to put my foot up their asses! Both feet! Hell, I'm going to stick anything I can in their asses, and I'm going to enlov it. The guys start laughing again. Jack boils red. 
JACK (CONT'D) Shut up!! I didn't mean-- Just get on your damn bikes! We're riding to Lucas! The guys start towards their bikes. Oilcan sidles up next to Jack. 
OILCAN Sometimes it helps if you say things in your mind first, then say it out loud, you know? Jack looks at Oilcan for a beat, then bends down, picks a dart up out of the ash, and jabs it into his shoulder. 
OILCAN (CONT'D) Oww! Dammit! 
"Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 67. 
JACK I did that in my mind, first. Jack smiles calmly and walks off. 
(TO CHARLEY) Give me your gun! Give me the gun! He deserves it! 
(TO BULL) I'll kill you! Doug and Woody hold on to Bob until he calms down. Doug and Woody start to laugh. Bob cools off for another moment, then starts laughing as well. 
WOODY No this is living! 
DOUG We just slapped the bull! The group high fives each other in congratulations, and starts away: Bruised, muddy and laughing. ANGLE ON: THE BULL. He pushes on the gate that Charley was holding open. The gate swings open. ANGLE ON: WOODY, BOB and DOUG. They walk with Charley and the Dooble brothers, laughing and carrying on. 
"Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 78. Bob does an impression of how he dodged it and goes for some more high fives - but suddenly, the bull charges into frame and nails him. As Bob goes flying; we: 
CUT TO: 
EXT. TOWN SQUARE / BLOCK PARTY - LATER THAT NIGHT 
The block party is winding down. Dudley is sitting by himself at a picnic table, in post-Maggie bliss. DOUG, WOODY and BOB approach, dirty and beaten from the bull - but, carrying on happily. 
WOODY Man, did you see the look on Bob's face when he got up? Didn't dodge him that time! Woody and Doug laugh. Bob looks pissed. 
BOB I'm going to go back there with a rifle tomorrow and shoot one of his legs off. Then we'll see who's tough. 
DOUG 
(LAUGHING) Why just one leg? 
BOB Because I want to kick him in the face. Doug and Woody laugh again. Bob just steams. They spot DUDLEY, and head over to him. 
DOUG Hey, Dud. You look happy. 
DUDLEY I danced with her. And she likes macs. You know what that means? 
DOUG You have a sister? 
DUDLEY I have a soulmate. 
DOUG I thought you said the color ipod was your soulmate. 
"Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 79. 
DUDLEY I thought it was. But now, I realize that ipod was just a well-designed whore. The guys smile. It's been a good night for all of them. 
DOUG Come on. Let's go back to the hotel. We've got to get up early to do some fishing. The guys start walking towards the Main Street hotel. 
WOODY Okay, fine. But after fishing - we hit the open road and keep moving, okay? 
DOUG Open road, baby! 
BOB Wild Hogs ride! The guys continue with enthusiastic cheers as we hear the off-screen rumble of engines. Doug looks down the street and sees: THE HELLS ANGELS. All forty of them are riding into town - and the guys will be in their view any second. Woody is frozen with fear. 
DOUG Are you kidding me? Woody, you're going to have to talk to these guys again. Get them to leave this town alone-- 
WOODY Hiiiiiiiidee! DOUG, BOB and DUDLEY look confused. Woody looks around desperately for somewhere to hide - but the Hells Angels are too close. There's no time. Woody spots a port-o- potty from the block party and starts corralling Doug, Bob and Dudley into it. 
WOODY (CONT'D) Go! Go! Go! Woody pushes his puzzled friends into the port-o-potty, then gets in with them and shuts the door, just as the Hells Angels cruise by them. 
"Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 80. 
INT. PORT-O-POTTY - CONTINUOUS 
All four guys are squished inside the port-o-potty like sardines. 
DOUG Woody!? What the hell is wrong with-- 
WOODY Shhhh! They'll hear you! Don't make a sound! 
EXT. TOWN SQUARE - CONTINUOUS 
The Hells Angels park their bikes. We see all the townspeople have stopped enjoying themselves, and just stand there, scared. Jack gets off his bike and looks around. 
JACK 
(YELLS OUT) Good evening, Lucas. Now, as hurt as I am that you're having a party and didn't invite us... We're only here for one reason. The "Wild Hogs." Where the hell are they!? 
INT. PORT-O-POTTY - CONTINUOUS 
Doug looks at Woody. He's starting to figure it out. Woody guiltily avoids Doug's glare and watches the Hells Angels through a vent in the port-o-potty. 
WOODY 
(TO GUYS) I'm sorry, okay! 
DOUG Sorry? That's it!? You're sorry!? 
WOODY Yes, I'm sorry! I just didn't want us to go back. 
DOUG Why? It's just a stupid vacation! 
"Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 84. 
WOODY Because I don't have anything to go back to, okay! Doug and Bob go silent. Woody looks away - trying to collect himself. After a moment, he faces them. 
WOODY (CONT'D) I've lost everything. The firm fired me, Claudia left me... It's all gone. My whole life is gone. I don't even have enough money to get my lawn raked anymore. Doug, Bob and Dudley are stupefied. Woody takes a deep breath and continues. 
WOODY (CONT'D) That's why I couldn't go back. This isn't a vacation for me, it's the only thing I have left. There's nothing more in my life but you guys. So, I lied about the Hells Angels. I lied because I wanted to have one thing in my life that wasn't a complete failure. A real trip with my best friends... You're all I got. I'm sorry. Woody lowers his head. The guys take this in for a minute. Woody looks at them, waiting for their sympathy. Finally, Doug speaks. 
DOUG (realizing, to Woody) This trip is just you running from your life. Your miserable, screwed up life. 
(GETTING ANGRIER) And you knew you couldn't go back to it, so instead you screwed up our lives, too... You asshole! Woody's puppy-dog face dissolves. 
WOODY Fine! I see how important I am to you guys. That's just fine. I just thought being a "Wild Hog" meant something! Woody takes off his "Wild Hogs" jacket and throws it at their feet. He hops out of the fountain and storms off down the street. 
"Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 85. 
DOUG It doesn't mean anything! It's just a patch my wife made!! Doug, Bob and Dudley look at each other. After a moment, they look over to the sidewalk and see: ALL THE TOWNSPEOPLE, staring at them in disappointed silence. Slowly, the townspeople turn and quietly head back to their homes. Doug, Bob and Dudley lower their heads in disgrace. So much for being heroes. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. POLICE STATION - LATER THAT NIGHT 
DOUG stands in the darkened police station with DUDLEY, CHARLEY, BUCK and EARL. CHARLEY looks out the window with DOUG. 
CHARLEY Looks like they're winding down some. 
DOUG You think? 
EXT. MAIN STREET DINER - CONTINUOUS 
The Hells Angels have returned, and set up shop in the diner, but are also flowing out onto the street. Jack stumbles into the middle of the road, with a bottle of tequila in his hand. 
JACK 
(YELLING OUT) Alright, Wild Hogs. We know you're in town somewhere, 'cause you haven't checked out of the hotel. We're a little smarter than you thought, huh? 
OILCAN Hell yeah we are!! Wheeew! Oilcan smashes a beer can against his own head. 
JACK So we're going to wait right here 'till you show up. Weeks, if we have to. Hell, we might just make ourselves the "Lucas Angels." That has a nice ring to it, doesn't it? 
"Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 86. Jack laughs. 
INT. POLICE STATION - SAME TIME 
The guys watch the commotion through the window. 
DUDLEY Crap. I was thinking of that for us. 
CHARLEY You guys just stay in the station tonight. No one needs to go out there and be a hero and end up getting hurt. 
DOUG Thanks, Charley. Charley and the Dooble brothers look a little surprised. 
CHARLEY Wow. So... You're not going out there? Doug sighs in irritation. 
DOUG 
(SNAPS) Well, you're the cop. Why don't you go out there? Charley is visibly hurt. His lip starts to tremble. 
CHARLEY 
(TEARING UP) That's not cool, man. Charley runs out the back door of the station. EARL shakes his head and looks at Doug. 
EARL You know, people have feelings. Sure, I make comments about "chum face," here. But that's because every time I look at him I see parts of his brain. But nobody has the right to hurt Charley like that. He has both sides of his head. Earl storms off, leaving BUCK, who was standing on his left and hasn't heard or seen any of them leave. He stands there, looking at Doug and Dudley. 
"Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 87. 
SMASH CUT TO: 
INT. MAIN STREET DINER - A FEW MINUTES LATER 
DUDLEY kicks open the front door. JACK and the other Hells Angels are inside, drinking and carrying on. 
DUDLEY Alright, let's end this! The Hells Angels don't even notice him. Dudley bites his lip in frustration. 
DUDLEY (CONT'D) 
(YELLS) Hey! ! Dudley takes a table full of empty beer glasses and flips it over. Everyone in the diner goes silent and looks at him. Jack stands up and smiles. 
JACK Well, well. One of you came to face the music, huh? That's brave. And stupid. The Hells Angels laugh. Dudley takes a deep breath and walks up to Jack. 
DUDLEY I'm not here to face any music. I'm here to make you a deal. A deal I think you'd be smart to take. 
JACK Yeah? What deal? 
DUDLEY You leave the town of Lucas, and my friends alone, and I do something for you. Something you can't live without. Jack looks interested. Dudley confidently sets a laptop on the counter, and punches a few keys. He swivels it around to show the gang. 
"Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 97. 
DUDLEY (CONT'D) See where that says "Domain for sale?" Guess what that means. Your gang doesn't have a website! Nothing! No way to tell people about your history, post photos, sell shirts... You guys are living in the complete dark ages! (laughs cockily, then) So they way I see it: I need a favor from you and you need a favor from me. Jack walks over to the computer and looks at Dudley for a moment. He then picks the computer up and smashes it down on the ground. It breaks into a hundred pieces. Jack smiles at Dudley and puts his foot through what's left of it. The Hells Angels stifle laughter. Dudley is starting to look a little nervous. 
JACK 
(TO DUDLEY) No deal. Dudley nods. 
DUDLEY Okay, then. Thanks for hearing me out. Dudley starts for the door, but several Hells Angels move over and block his path. Dudley stops and collects himself for a moment - then breaks into a panicked sprint for the other exit. The Hells Angels quickly spring into action and tackle him to the ground. 
DUDLEY (CONT'D) Sanctuary! Sanctuary!! The Hells Angels pull off him, confused. 
OILCAN What? 
DUDLEY Sanctuary. You have to take me to a church and leave me alone. The Hells Angels look at each other and shrug. 
OILCAN 
(TO DUDLEY) No we don't. 
"Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 98. 
DUDLEY 
(DEFEATED) I know. The Hells Angels move back in on him. Dudley closes his eyes and rolls into a ball. 
EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF MAGGIE'S HOUSE - SAME TIME 
DOUG, BOB, and WOODY are walking back from the lake, and pass by Maggie's house. BUD, standing on the porch, sees them and smiles. 
BUD If you're heading back to town, I wouldn't go on an empty stomach. The guys see Bud and smile. 
BUD (CONT'D) Come have lunch. This is kind of our "fallout" diner. Smaller kitchen, but less piss on the bathroom floor. 
DOUG Well, we can change that. Bud laughs as the guys enter the house. 
INT. BUD AND MAGGIE'S HOUSE - A FEW MINUTES LATER 
DOUG, BOB and WOODY are sitting at one of many card tables arranged in the family room, eating lunch. CHARLEY enters through the front door.. 
CHARLEY Hey, guys. Having your final meal? Charley laughs. Doug, Bob and Woody don't. 
CHARLEY (CONT'D) Sorry. 
BOB 
(TO CHARLEY) Where are Buck and Earl? 
CHARLEY They're coming. Buck's ear is giving him some equilibrium problems. 
"Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 99. EARL ENTERS, holding the door open for BUCK, who walks through slowly. 
EARL 
(TO BUCK) Just keep your eyes forward and head up. 
(INTO PHONE) So here's what we're going to do, now. You guys are going to pay us a visit. And you're going to bring a "disobedience fee," of ten thousand dollars. Cash. And don't even think about calling any cops. Just you guys and ten grand. And if you don't show up in an hour - Well then, We'll just take the fine out of your friend's legs... Which we're going to break with a tire iron. 
DUDLEY (yelling to phone) Don't bring the money, guys! 
(MORE) 
"Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 102. 
DUDLEY (CONT'D) I'm a computer programmer! I don't need my legs! Jack considers this and turns back to the phone. 
JACK 
(INTO PHONE) His hands! We'll break his hands! 
DUDLEY Dammit. (yelling to phone) Bring the money! 
INT. BUD AND MAGGIE'S HOUSE - SIMULTANEOUS 
Doug shakes his head at Dudley's stupidity. 
DOUG 
(INTO PHONE) We'll bring the money. Just don't touch our friend! 
INT. BIKER BAR - SIMULTANEOUS 
JACK 
(INTO PHONE) Oh, I won't touch him if you bring that money. But if you don't, I'll be touching him all night long. And I'll be enjoying it. The other bikers suddenly stifle laughter. 
JACK (CONT'D) What!? There was nothing wrong with that one! That was tough! Those guys are afraid of me, now. They know how much I want 'em! The gang laughs again. 
JACK (CONT'D) Shut up!! The gang stops laughing, off Jack's warning glare. Dudley looks up from the floor. 
DUDLEY Hey can we call my cat, now? She needs to hear my voice. 
"Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 103. Jack looks down at Dudley, then to the other bikers. 
JACK 
(TO BIKERS) Get me more duct tape? A biker nods and grabs another role of duct tape. He heads over to Dudley. 
DUDLEY Crap. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. BUD AND MAGGIE'S HOUSE - A FEW MINUTES LATER 
DOUG sits in a chair, deep in thought. BOB, WOODY, EARL, BUCK, and BUD stand with other members of the town. MAGGIE is on a couch, sobbing into her hands. 
MAGGIE 
(CRYING) Sweet Dudley. He went there to save everybody and now they're going to break his hands. 
DOUG No they aren't. We're going to get him back. 
CHARLEY We sure are. I'm going to call the Highway Patrol. They'll be there in-- 
BOB No way. They said no law. We can't risk them doing anything to Dudley. 
WOODY Bob's right. We can call the Highway Patrol after we get Dud back, but we shouldn't piss these guys off while he's still in their hands. 
BOB I'm going to call Karen and have the cash wired out of our savings. 
WOODY No. No way. This is my fault. All this is my fault. I have some money in my severance package. We're using it. 
"Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 104. 
MAGGIE Wait, he did this because of me. I have a thousand dollars in tip money I want to put in. 
BUD I have a couple thousand in the diner emergency fund I'll put in, too. Doug, who has been thinking all this over, stands up from his chair. 
DOUG No. Nobody is paying anything. Everyone stops and gives Doug a puzzled look. He has a new fire behind his eyes. His suburban quietude has transformed into something more... valiant. 
WOODY What? 
DOUG Yeah. But not just for Dudley. If you win, we'll give you ten grand and go back home. You'll never see us again. But... If I win, you let Dudley go and you never set foot in Lucas again. This town is off limits to the Hells Angels. Forever. 
"Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 108. Jack looks back to the Hells Angels, who chuckle. This will be a quick fight. 
DOUG (CONT'D) Well? You in, or are you too much of a bitch? The Hells Angels freeze. Jack grits his teeth in rage and turns back to Doug. 
JACK All right. Let's party, tough guy. 
DOUG Great. Doug nods, trying to look confidant, but it's quickly fading away. 
DOUG (CONT'D) 
(UNSURE) Great. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. TOWN SQUARE - A FEW MINUTES LATER 
DOUG and JACK are standing "in their corners," opposite each other in the dirt parking lot. They're surrounded by a circle of Hells Angels, rowdily waiting for the fight to commence. WOODY and BOB coach Doug in his corner. 
WOODY Just stay clear of the big punches. You've got more stamina than this guy. 
DOUG All right. When do I hit back? 
WOODY Um... Just try and get him tired. I don't think punches will do much to him. Doug gives Woody a concerned look. Woody shrugs. Jack steps into the circle and throws off his jacket. 
JACK 
(CALLING OUT) Time for your beating, yuppie! 
"Wild Hogs" writers first draft 
DOUG 
(TO BOB) Tell my wife I won - then got hit by a truck. Doug takes a deep breath and starts into the circle. 
DOUG (CONT'D) 
(TO JACK) All right. Let's do this-- Doug doesn't even finish his sentence as Jack lands a punch on the side of his head. Doug is stunned, as Jack sends his other fist crashing into Doug's forehead. Doug goes flying backwards, and falls down in the dirt. The Hells Angels cheer. Jack high fives them as Doug struggles back to his feet and looks back at Woody and Bob, cradling his face. 
DOUG (CONT'D) Ow! Dammit Jesus that hurt! 
(TO WOODY) It really hurts. Damn! Jack comes back over to Doug. Jack throws another right, but this time Doug ducks, still cradling his jaw. 
DOUG (CONT'D) Yes!-- But Doug is instantly punched in the stomach by Jack's other fist. Doug winces as he doubles over in agony. Drool drips out of his mouth. This isn't pretty. Jack takes him by the back of the shirt and lifts him into the air. The Hells Angels cheer as Jack tosses Doug five yards into the dirt. 
JACK Don't get tired yet. The hurt is just beginning. Doug tries to stand back up, but it's getting harder. He slyly grabs a handful of sand as he starts to stand. 
DOUG Hah! Doug whips around and throws the sand towards Jack's face; However, his aim is off. The sand hits Jack in the chest and falls away. Jack looks at Doug and shakes his head. 
"Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 110. 
DOUG (CONT'D) Damn. Jack punches Doug square in the face again. Doug crumples to the ground in pain. Jack turns back to the Hells Angels. 
JACK Man, this isn't even a workout. Jack laughs and puts his aviator sunglasses back on, as Doug quickly stands up and whips around at him. 
DOUG Ahhh! Doug throws another handful of sand. This time he aims carefully; but Jack now has sunglasses on. The sand bounces harmlessly off the lenses. Doug cringes and waits for the punch, which comes like a freight train into his stomach. Doug doubles over again as Jack lines up another punch. 
JACK This one's gonna break bone. 
DOUG Wait! Wait-- Doug straightens up and looks curiously at Jack's mouth. 
DOUG (CONT'D) Your tooth-- That's an acute periodontal abscess. 
JACK What? 
DOUG look, I really hate you, but I don't want to feel responsible for a death. I'm a dentist. I took an oath. Same one as doctors. If the infection in that tooth gets to the root - it could seep into your nervous system. Just let me look-- Doug slowly reaches towards Jack's mouth. Jack doesn't move. 
JACK You're a dentist? 
"Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 111. 
DOUG Yeah. One of the best. And I know when your gums are that swollen and your 
BICUSPID-- And Wham! Doug punches Jack square in the mouth. Jack goes down hard. Woody and Bob cheer. 
CHARLEY And I believe that's his jacket. Jack begrudgingly takes off Dudley's "Wild Hogs" jacket and tosses it to him. Dudley proudly puts it on. 
CHARLEY (CONT'D) And as I recall, that '51 Panhead was traded to Dudley. Jack looks over at the mint condition motorcycle and shakes his head. 
JACK No way. He can have his Sportster back. 
CHARLEY Uh uh. A deal's a deal, Jack. Jack grits his teeth and throws a set of keys at Dudley. The crowd chatters in approval as Dudley gets on the '51 Panhead and starts the engine. He revs it a few times and Jack shoots Doug an infuriated glare. 
JACK 
(TO DOUG) Hope you're happy. You suburban posers are a disease. You need to learn some damn respect for real bikers. Doug smiles. 
DOUG You still don't get it do you, Jack? 
JACK Get what? 
DOUG We are the real bikers. As Doug says this, Dudley kicks the Panhead into gear and shoots forward - out of control. He instantly crashes into a steel light post. Everyone in the crowd cringes 
DUDLEY LOOKS as the bike falls over in a crumpled heap. up from the ground. 
DUDLEY Yeah, I'll take the Sportster back, I guess.

DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. STREET OUTSIDE POLICE STATION - LATER THAT AFTERNOON 
It's later that afternoon in Lucas. DOUG, BOB and WOODY walk to their motorcycles with CHARLEY, EARL and BUCK. 
CHARLEY Well, I wish you guys would stay longer. 
DOUG Ahh, we should be heading back. I think we've had enough excitement for one trip. Earl steps forward and shakes Doug's hand. 
EARL You guys were a blessing to this place. I mean... I'm not going to get all emotional like "hamburger head" here always does. Earl laughs and looks to his left. Buck isn't there. He quickly looks to the right, where Buck is staring at him in disbelief. 
BUCK What'd you just call me? 
EARL 
(CAUGHT) Um... 
BUCK It's just a little scar! I'm still better looking than you! Buck goes to storm off, but after a few steps, tilts left and falls over. 
BUCK (CONT'D) 
(FROM GROUND) Dammit! Doug shakes his head, then turns to Woody and Bob. 
DOUG (to Woody and Bob) You guys ready to head back? 
"Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 117. Woody takes a deep breath and shakes his head. 
WOODY You know what? I think I'm going to press on. Keep heading West. 
DOUG You are? 
WOODY Yeah. Why not? I feel good about my life again. And I'd like to see what San Francisco's all about. Doug nods and looks to Bob. You can tell he wants to go. 
BOB I'm in, too! Let's ride to San-- Suddenly, a mini-van pulls up. KAREN and KELLY hop out. 
BOB / DOUG Karen? / Kelly? 
KAREN 
(TO BOB) I told you I was coming, Bob! 
KELLY 
(TO DOUG) Hey, honey. Kelly kisses Doug. He smiles, glad to see her. 
DOUG Hey, baby. What are you doing here? 
KELLY Karen said you guys were in trouble. I kept calling your cell, but somebody programmed it to not receive calls from our house. Doug shoots Woody a look. 
WOODY

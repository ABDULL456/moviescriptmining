Paddy chokes up. Tommy looks at him. Closes his eyes. 
TOMMY (CONT'D) I think I liked you better when you were a drunk. 
An overwhelmed Paddy sips his coffee and looks at Tommy, who is fading. The pills are kicking in. He tries to open his eyes, but it's no use, and after a few moments he's out. 
Paddy glances down, where some pills have fallen out of Tommy's pocket and scattered on the rug. He watches his son. Relieved and heartbroken at the same time. 
EXT. BRENDAN AND TESS' HOME, PHILADELPHIA - DAY 
A chaotic birthday party in the back yard of a middle-class home in the suburbs of Philly. A CLUSTER OF 5-YEAR OLDS run about, some whacking at a pinata hanging from a tree, some whizzing down a large blow-up slide, some getting their faces painted by a make-up artist dressed like a GYPSY. 
TESS CONLON (29) bounces around the yard, multi-tasking like a champion and filming the proceedings with a VIDEO CAMERA. She trains the camera on BRENDAN CONLON (30), who sits in a lawn chair in a scarf, hat, and women's make-up. 
THROUGH VIDEO CAMERA LENS: TWO GIRLS, EMILY (5), WHO WEARS A BIRTHDAY GIRL CROWN, AND ROSIE (3), MIMIC THE MAKE-UP WOMAN AND APPLY MASCARA AND BLUSH TO BRENDAN. 
TESS What's going on here? 
BRENDAN Well, I'm not sure, but I think Daddy is now a princess. 
Tess laughs. Brendan looks at her with a "Help me out here" expression. 
TESS Em, you want to open your presents? 
The make-over ends abruptly at the mention of "presents." Emily, little sister in tow, runs over to a table filled with gifts as PARENTS and CHILDREN gather around. 
Brendan gets out of the lawn chair and follows Tess over to the gift table. Amidst all the presents is one BOX, covered in pink wrapping paper, that is far larger than the rest. 
TESS (CONT'D) (off pink box) This an awfully big box. 
BRENDAN It's her birthday. 
Tess turns the video camera toward Brendan again. He couldn't look more ridiculous. And he obviously didn't clear the gift with his wife. He grins at her as she lowers the camera. 
TESS (TEASING) I know, but that's why you call it a budget. You set it, and you don't budge. 
Brendan smiles in his make-up. Kisses his wife. 
EXT. BRENDAN AND TESS' HOME - LATE AFTERNOON 
The remnants of the birthday party lay strewn across the lawn. Tess, in a cocktail waitress outfit, says goodbye to her MOM and the kids, who play on the swing set. 
She walks toward the garage and enters to find Brendan pressing free weights on an old bench. 
INT. GARAGE - CONTINUOUS 
Brendan continues to lift as Tess rushes in and tosses a bag of garbage in the bin. A deep CUT, hidden earlier by the make- up, is visible on his cheek. 
TESS Hey babe, I'm late. Mom's saying goodbye to the girls. She's gotta get on the road. They've been fed. They just need a bath. 
BRENDAN I'm on it. 
TESS Can you get them down at a reasonable time tonight? They're exhausted. 
Brendan kisses Tess. Looks at her outfit. 
BRENDAN Where's the rest of that skirt? 
TESS Babe. 
BRENDAN Listen, if any guys give you a hassle in that joint tonight you give me a call, okay? 
TESS (off his cut) Yeah. Just like you gave me a call when those Temple frat boys decided to smash up your face. 
BRENDAN I told you, most nights I sit on the stool and grade papers, but every now and then I need some action. 
TESS Alright, well wait up for me tonight. I'll see what I can do about that. 
STEPHON How many laws this dude got? 
BRENDAN (LAUGHING) The dude? The dude has three. Newton the dude says that for every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction. 
Brendan looks toward the classroom door, where two red-and- white clad CHEERLEADERS are peering in, then walks over to KC, a blonde cheerleader seated in his class. She is working a Blackberry and doesn't notice him approaching. 
BRENDAN (CONT'D) For example, if KC does not stop the action of sending texts in class... 
Brendan stands directly in front of her desk. She quickly shoves the Blackberry under a stack of books. 
BRENDAN (CONT'D) ...and tell her posse outside to beat it... 
He turns and shoos away the two cheerleaders peering in the window. 
BRENDAN (CONT'D) ...then my reaction might be to send her down to Principal Zito's office. Thus setting our world back in proper balance. 
KC Mr. C, I put it away. 
The class busts on KC as Brendan walks back to his desk and sits on top of it. It's clear from the vibe in the room that he's a very popular teacher. Then the BELL rings. 
BRENDAN Alright, before you go, I have your tests from last week. 
INT. COLT'S PITTSBURGH FIGHT CLUB - DAY 
Fenroy sits at the front desk and looks at his computer. Watches "MMA LIVE" and another feature on the big upcoming Sparta tournament. 
Tommy, wearing a wife beater and old gray sweats, works a bag and eyeballs an ENTOURAGE that surrounds a ring. Inside, a heavily-muscled FIGHTER with a mohawk, MAD DOG GRIMES (30s), is putting a beating on his SPARRING PARTNER. The obsequious nature of the entourage makes it clear that Mad Dog is somebody important. 
In the ring, the sparring partner takes a vicious spinning back fist to the chin, goes down in a heap, and doesn't get up. COLT BOYD (40s), clearly in charge, throws up his hands as Mad Dog laughs. 
MAD DOG Where do you find these girls? 
Colt climbs into the ring and looks at the fallen fighter. Glances at Mad Dog. 
COLT BOYD We got a tournament coming up. You gonna kill every guy in the `Burgh? (TO FENROY) Fenroy. Get me some ice. And call that Puerto Rican kid, the one that fights outa the Bottoms. If he's here in 20 minutes, he gets 200 bucks. 
TOMMY Yo, I'll fight him. 
Colt turns around and looks at Tommy. As does Mad Dog, who smiles down at him from inside the ring. 
COLT BOYD Do me a favor guy, go back to your bag. We don't need anybody else getting hurt. G'head. Take a walk. 
Tommy walks back to his bag. Mad Dog smiles. Looks at Tommy's outfit. 
MAD DOG Yo Rock, what happened? You leave Mick and Paulie at home today? 
Tommy stops. Walks back to the ring as Fenroy approaches. 
FENROY (TO COLT) His phone's disconnected. 
COLT BOYD Then go through the list. Get me Joe Bones. 
TOMMY (TO COLT) All I'm saying is if you need somebody to help you, I'm happy to keep your boy warm for you. 
Colt looks at Mad Dog. What do you think? The Mohawked fighter looks at Tommy. Shrugs. It's his funeral. 
COLT BOYD You ever fought before? 
TOMMY Yeah. 
Colt studies Tommy. Sees he's serious. Gives in. 
COLT BOYD (TO FENROY) This guy sign a waiver? 
FENROY All good. 
COLT BOYD What's your name? 
BRENDAN That's not how I do things. 
DAN TAYLOR Well, then you're looking at foreclosure. 
Brendan gets up and storms out of the office. 
ANNOUNCER #1 (V.O.) Utter domination by Tommy Conlon, the undefeated freshman from Pittsburgh... 
INT. PADDY'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Paddy sits in front of the TV and watches an old VIDEO TAPE of a wrestling tournament. The bottom of the screen reads: 1994 PA STATE WRESTLING FINALS. CONLON VS. SPEERY. 
ON TV SCREEN: 14-YEAR-OLD TOMMY DOMINATES AN OPPONENT. 
ANNOUNCER #1 (V.O.) ...the prodigy has yet to yield a single point in the entire tournament. It's just unprecedented. 
ANNOUNCER #2 (V.O.) Tommy trained by his father since the age of five. 
ANNOUNCER #1 (V.O.) You're talking about Paddy Conlon. 
ANNOUNCER #2 (V.O.) The controversial Paddy Conlon. 
ON TV SCREEN: A YOUNGER PADDY SHOUTS INSTRUCTIONS AS TOMMY CRUSHES HIS OPPONENT. 
ANNOUNCER #1 (V.O.) Say what you will about the methods of the former Marine, but he's led his son to six straight junior Olympic titles, and now just moments away from a high school state championship. And there it is! Wow! 
ON TV SCREEN: TOMMY PINS HIS OPPONENT AND LEAPS OFF THE MAT IN JUBILATION. 
ANNOUNCER #2 (V.O.) There's just no limit to what the future holds for this kid! 
As Paddy watches, the DOORBELL RINGS. He makes his way to the door as the tape continues to play. 
ANNOUNCER #1 (V.O.) Tommy told me that he's chasing the record of Theogenes, apparently a mythical Greek fighter said to be unbeaten in over 1400 bouts... 
Paddy opens the door to find Colt Boyd standing on the stoop. 
COLT BOYD How you doin,' sir? I'm looking for Tommy Riordan. 
Paddy registers the name "Riordan." 
PADDY Who? 
COLT BOYD Tommy Riordan? My name's Colt Boyd. 
PADDY What business you got with Tommy? 
COLT BOYD None yet. That's why I'm here. I manage fighters. 
Colt looks at Paddy. Jams his hands in his pockets. He's obviously waiting for an invite inside. It doesn't come. 
COLT BOYD (CONT'D) Tommy's been working out at my gym. He put a beating on the number one middleweight contender in the world today. I want to know more about the guy. Maybe help him out. I have a lot of contacts, Mr. Riordan. 
PADDY Conlon. Name's Conlon. And anything you want to know about Tommy, you gotta ask him yourself. 
COLT BOYD I'm just looking for some general information here. 
PADDY Like I said, anything you want to know about Tommy, you gotta ask him yourself. 
COLT BOYD Look, I don't mean to interrupt your night. He put this address down when he signed up at the gym. 
PADDY He doesn't live here. 
Paddy closes the door on a frustrated Colt. 
INT. BRENDAN'S CAR - NIGHT 
Brendan drives down the road on the outskirts of town and talks on his cell. 
BRENDAN I went in to apply. They were only paying nine bucks an hour. Then I saw a sign for this other thing. 
Tess can't believe what she's hearing. 
BRENDAN (CONT'D) They're putting us out of the house in three months, we're running out OF OPTIONS-- 
TESS (FURIOUS) Then they'll put us out of the house in three months. I'd rather go back to the old apartment than see you in the back of an ambulance again. (BEAT) I thought we agreed that we weren't going to raise our children in a family where their father gets beat up for a living. 
BRENDAN We're not giving up the house. This is our home. We're not going BACKWARDS 
Tess reaches up and touches his battered face. Calms herself down. Embraces her husband. 
TESS We'll figure it out. But this is what we're not going back to. 
EXT. TRACKSIDE DINER - MORNING 
A steady rain tumbles down over an old-school diner in the shadow of the railroad tracks. 
INT. DINER - SAME 
Paddy sits in a booth and takes a sip of coffee. Judging by the spent sugar packets and the half-eaten club sandwich, he's been there a while. 
The front door swings open and Tommy enters wearing his watch cap and sweats. He makes his way over to the booth and plops himself down. It's clear something's on his mind but he doesn't say anything. Finally, Paddy engages him. 
PADDY You wanted to talk? 
TOMMY Yeah. (BEAT) I'm gonna start fighting. 
PADDY That right? 
TOMMY Don't play babe in the woods with me. I know that guy from the gym came to see you. 
PADDY Colt Boyd? I didn't tell him anything, Tommy. 
TOMMY We wouldn't be sitting here now if you did. 
Tommy grabs a fry off Paddy's plate. 
TOMMY (CONT'D) Alright. Look. There's this tournament. A big tournament. Top sixteen middleweights in the world. Single elimination. Winner take all for a lot of money. I'm gonna do that. But if I'm doin' it, then I'm gonna need a trainer. Now that much you were good at. (off Paddy grinning) No, no, no. This doesn't mean anything. 
Paddy tries to tether it down, but he's happy. Tommy looks at him sternly. 
TOMMY (CONT'D) I'm serious. We train. That's it. I don't wanna hear a word about anything but training, you understand? You wanna tell your war stories, you can take `em down to the VFW. You can take `em to a meeting, or church, or wherever the hell it is you go nowadays. 
PADDY What about Colt Boyd? 
TOMMY What about him? I told him I don't train with people I don't know. 
PADDY Ah, the devil you know. 
TOMMY Excuse me? 
PADDY The devil you know is better than the devil you don't. 
Tommy looks at him. Grins for the first time. 
PADDY (CONT'D) Chasing Theogenes. It'll be kinda like old times. 
TOMMY (ANGRY) I just told you, this doesn't mean anything. You get that through your skull right now or I'm walking. 
Paddy calmly sips his coffee, then leans in on Tommy with a stern look. The old lion's got a few teeth left. 
PADDY Alright. Alright. But you get something through your skull, too. You called me. So don't go threatening to walk every five minutes. And since this is about training, you dump whatever it is you need to dump as far as those pills are concerned. I don't want to see `em. 
Tommy gives him a hard look, but the old man doesn't shy away. 
PADDY (CONT'D) In fact, hand `em over right now. (BEAT) I know they're on you, Tommy. You sounded like a goddamn maraca coming through the door. 
Zito looks at Brendan. Puzzled. 
BRENDAN (CONT'D) I fought for a living. (BEAT) Guess I forgot to put that down on my application. 
JOE ZITO Yeah, I guess you did. 
Zito sits back down. 
BRENDAN Look, I'm sorry, Joe. It's just-- 
JOE ZITO Listen, the school district's not going to tolerate school teachers cockfighting in strip clubs. 
BRENDAN It was the parking lot of a strip club. 
JOE ZITO Wherever it was, you can't be doing it, alright? I mean this is a serious--shit, he's here. 
Zito sees the SUPERINTENDENT enter the foyer outside his office. He's looking none too pleased. 
JOE ZITO (CONT'D) This is a serious problem. (BEAT) Guy hasn't been inside a school since 9-11. 
BRENDAN What are we gonna do? 
JOE ZITO You say yes, sir. And you say no, sir. And you say it'll never happen again, sir. And then we just pray to God he's in a good mood. 
Brendan and Joe stand up. Zito can't tether down a slight grin. 
JOE ZITO (CONT'D) UFC? 
Brendan nods. Joe shakes his head. Impressed. 
JOE ZITO (CONT'D) Sonofabitch. 
INT. BRENDAN AND TESS' HOME - KID'S PLAYROOM - NIGHT 
Brendan sits in a miniature playroom off the kid's bedroom, putting glue on the leg of a TOY PIANO. Tess enters the bedroom, where the girls sleep, and leans into the playroom. They speak in whispers. 
TESS What are you doing? 
BRENDAN (OFF PIANO) The girls have an important piano recital in the morning. Got an equipment malfunction. (BEAT) How'd it go? 
TESS They're gonna review your case at the end of the semester, but until then you're suspended without pay. Joe gave me the number of his attorney. 
BRENDAN How the hell are we gonna pay for an attorney? 
Tess crouches down and enters the tiny room. She sits on the floor. 
TESS He talked to me for free. As a favor to Joe. 
BRENDAN That was nice. 
TESS He said there's no precedent for this. You'll be back by next semester. 
BRENDAN Next semester? 
Tess sighs. They sit in silence. There are no easy solutions. Finally, Brendan speaks up. 
BRENDAN (CONT'D) Look, Tess. They have these smoker fights all over. There's one in Lancaster next week. There's two in Dover the week after. Wilmington. Camden. Baltimore. It could keep us afloat. 
TESS You're gonna put yourself through this over and over, for five hundred bucks a pop? 
BRENDAN Some of them pay a little more than that. (BEAT) I would have had to bounce for a month to make what I made in two hours last night. 
Brendan looks at his wife. 
BRENDAN (CONT'D) And these guys, they're not real fighters. They're just guys who have seen too much UFC on TV. If you have a better solution, I'm all ears. 
Tess sits quietly. Knows they have limited options. 
AV What tape? 
BRADFORD The tape. 
AV drops his cards, rushes to his bunk, pulls out a steel container loaded with VIDEOTAPES and sifts through it. They are labeled by day and month. AV finds what he's looking for, loads it into the camera, and hits PLAY. 
ON VIDEO SCREEN: A CHAOTIC FIRE FIGHT IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT. MUZZLE FLASHES. TRACER LIGHTS. MAYHEM. THE CAMERA FOCUSES ON A FLIPPED TANK, HALF OF IT SUBMERGED IN WATER. A MARINE, HEAD SHAVED BUT ALMOST CERTAINLY TOMMY, SUDDENLY APPEARS AND CLIMBS ON TOP OF THE TANK, REACHING FOR THE HATCH. 
BRADFORD Freeze. 
AV holds the "Pause" button down as Bradford looks at the screen in disbelief. It's definitely Tommy. 
BRADFORD (CONT'D) That's him. That's him. 
INT. CAMPANA FIGHTING SYSTEM - DAY 
In a top MMA gym, FRANK CAMPANA (40s) works in a ring with Brazilian superstar MARCO SANTOS (20s) and other FIGHTERS. The sound of CLASSICAL MUSIC fills the air. 
FRANK Let the music sink in to you. This is Beethoven. Breathe. Breathe. 
As Frank teaches, Brendan walks in the door. The great trainer notices him and walks over. 
FRANK (CONT'D) Do I know you? I think I know you. 
They embrace warmly. 
FRANK (CONT'D) Long time, brother. 
BRENDAN Liking the place, Frank. 
FRANK Thank you, brother. (off Brazilian fighter) You see this beast? Marco Santos? I'm training him for Sparta. 
BRENDAN Amazing, man. 
FRANK Come on back. 
The two head for the offices at the back of the gym. 
INT. FRANK'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
They walk into an office filled with PHOTOS of Frank in his fighting days. He was obviously somebody. The walls are also adorned with SPARTA posters. Frank reaches into a mini- fridge, pulling out a couple bottles of Vitamin water. He hands one to Brendan and motions for him to sit down. 
FRANK You look good, brother. How're the girls? 
BRENDAN Good. Good. I had another little one. Rosie. 
FRANK I know. Johnny C. told me she was in the hospital for a bit. I was gonna call, but then time went by. I don't know. I'm a piece of shit. I should have called. 
BRENDAN It's alright. 
FRANK No, Brendan. I'm sorry. 
BRENDAN It's all good. She's good now. 
Frank looks at his old friend. Smiles warmly. 
FRANK It's great to see you, man. So everything's going good? 
BRENDAN Yeah. Well, I've got a little problem. The guys at the bank want to take my house away. That's kind of why I came to see you, actually. 
Frank considers what he's hearing. 
FRANK I've got most of my dough tied up in this joint, but how much do you need? 
BRENDAN I didn't come here for a loan, Frank. (BEAT) I was hoping you'd train me. 
FRANK Train you for what? 
PADDY Hey Brendan, have you ever seen my hands so steady? Have you? 
BRENDAN I'm going inside. 
PADDY I've got a thousand days. A thousand days sober today. 
BRENDAN Well, that's great, Pop. But it doesn't change anything. 
PADDY What do you mean it doesn't change anything? Have a heart, Brendan. 
Paddy's words set Brendan off. A side of him we haven't seen before emerges. He approaches his father fiercely. 
BRENDAN You listen to me. You take your have-a-heart bullshit and you run it down the road. Run it out on someone who doesn't know you like I do. 
PADDY C'mon, Brendan. I thought maybe we could break bread. Open some lines of communication. 
BRENDAN You got two lines of communication, the telephone and the post office. Just because you decide it's a special day, it doesn't make it one for me. I got a wife and kids inside and they're waiting for me, so I don't have time for whatever this is. 
PADDY I know you got a wife and kids in there. I got a grand-daughter I haven't seen in three years and another I haven't even ever met. 
BRENDAN Why is that, Pop? Why is that? Do you remember having anything to do with that? 
Paddy nods. Casts his eyes down in shame. 
BRENDAN (CONT'D) That shit you pulled. Never again. And all the shit I saw growing up? That doesn't happen here. 
Brendan looks at the reformed Paddy, a measure of sympathy on his face. Then he heads for the house. 
BRENDAN (CONT'D) Take care of yourself. 
As he's halfway through the yard, Paddy calls out. 
PADDY Tommy's back. 
Brendan stops in his tracks. He turns and looks at his Dad. 
PADDY (CONT'D) He's in the `Burgh. 
BRENDAN Tommy's in Pittsburgh? 
PADDY He came to see me. 
BRENDAN He came to see you? 
PADDY He's over at the house. We're doing a little training at Fitzy's. Remember Fitzy's? It ain't Fitzy's anymore. 
Brendan walks closer. Incredulous. 
BRENDAN You and Tommy are training together? 
Paddy nods. 
BRENDAN (CONT'D) Tommy Conlon. 
PADDY Riordan. He's using your mother's maiden name now. 
BRENDAN I know what her name is. 
PADDY I thought you'd want to know he's back. That's why I drove all the way over here. 
BRENDAN I thought you came to break bread over a thousand days? 
PADDY That too. 
Brendan looks at him. Considers. 
BRENDAN Did he say if he wants to see me? 
Tommy heads up the stairs toward the locker room without acknowledging Colt, though he does allow a small smile to crease his lips. 
INT. LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Tommy pulls a crumpled PIECE OF PAPER out of a beat-up wallet and begins dumping change into an old pay phone on the wall. 
INT. PILAR FERNANDEZ'S HOUSE, EL PASO, TEXAS - SAME 
More of a shack than a house. PILAR FERNANDEZ (20s), a pretty but tired Mexican girl, watches a grainy TV with a six-year- old BOY and a four-year-old GIRL as the phone RINGS. The table it sits on has a FRAMED PICTURE of Tommy and another MARINE on it, their arms around each other in the Iraqi desert. 
INTERCUT TOMMY AND PILAR 
PILAR Bueno? 
TOMMY Pilar. It's Tommy. 
PILAR Tommy! Dios mio! I can't believe it! How are you? 
TOMMY Good good. How you doin'? 
PILAR OK. You know me, Tommy. (BEAT) I was getting really worried about you. 
TOMMY How're things? Kids are good? 
PILAR They're good. Maria's getting so big. She looks more like Manny every day. 
TOMMY How's little man? 
PILAR He's good. He's a good kid, Tommy. Takes care of his sister. He's a great kid. Everyone's good. 
TOMMY You know, Pilar, I haven't forgotten for one minute what I promised you. What I promised Manny. I've got an opportunity coming up to help you guys out. To take care of you guys. 
PILAR Whatever you can do, Tommy. I know Manny would really appreciate it. You worry too much. It's OK. We're hanging in there.

Frank watches as a team of FIGHTERS races up a steep hill. Marco is ahead of the pack, Brendan in the middle.

JON ANIK (ON SCREEN) (CONT'D) J.J., we've never seen this kind of Grand Prix tournament in the country before. Tell us, why the unique format? 
J.J. RILEY (ON SCREEN) Well, Jon, you know as well as anyone that in Mixed Martial Arts, anyone can beat anyone on a given night... 
EXT. PARKING LOT, SCRANTON PA - NIGHT 
Brendan takes steady blows from an OPPONENT in another smoker, then turns the tables, slams his man down, and chokes him out. His skills are improving. 
J.J. RILEY (V.O.) ...but with this type of format, it's gonna be tough to deny who the champion is. 
EXT. 33RD STREET TIRE YARD - MORNING 
FRANK (V.O.) You've gotta relax and stay calm in there. The cage is your home. You set the pace. 
INT. CAMPANA FIGHTING SYSTEM - DAY 
Brendan and Marco grapple. They're evenly matched. Frank looks on, impressed by Brendan. 
FRANK (V.O.) You set the rhythm. Feel the Beethoven. Be smarter than him. More patient. Wait for him to make a mistake. And when he does, that's your moment. 
Brendan turns Marco and gets him in a knee bar. Marco has nowhere to go and is forced to TAP. Frank jumps in the ring, all smiles, and slaps Brendan on the chest. 
FRANK No he did not tap you! Physics teacher! That's the best in the world there, son. 
EXT. 33RD STREET TIRE YARD - DAY 
Tommy keeps pushing the giant tires until he finally reaches the end of the yard. He's ready.

END OF TRAINING MONTAGE 
EXT. ST. IGNATIUS HOSPITAL - NIGHT 
An AMBULANCE pulls in front of the ER. 
INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE - LATER 
A sorely dejected Frank walks through an underground parking garage with Brendan. 
BRENDAN You gonna be OK? Wanna grab a bite? 
FRANK Nah. I'm gonna head home. I gotta call the boys and break the news. I'll call you tomorrow. 
Frank heads off through the lot. Brendan reaches his car, stops, considers. Calls out to Frank while jogging toward him. 
BRENDAN Coach! Hey, I know this isn't a great time. And it's too bad about Marco. But what about me? 
Brendan looks hopefully at Frank, who shakes his head as he begins to open the door of his `70 Ford Bronco. 
FRANK You talking about Sparta? Brendan, please. You got a better chance of starting a boy band. I'll talk to you tomorrow. 
BRENDAN It's a grand prix tournament. Which means anything can happen. You know that as well as I do. 
Frank looks at him. Sees how serious Brendan is. 
BRENDAN (CONT'D) They'll have to kill me to get me out of that cage. 
FRANK That's what I'm afraid of. 
BRENDAN Frank, I need this. You're real tight with those guys. You call them, they'll listen to you. 
FRANK You realize what you're asking me to do here, Brendan? We go down to AC and you get tapped out in five seconds, how does that benefit either one of us? 
BRENDAN That's not gonna happen. 
FRANK Not gonna happen. Wish I had a nickel for every time I heard that. 
BRENDAN (SMILING) It's not gonna happen. 
Frank breaks. Smiles. How can he say no? 
FRANK I'll make a call. 
Brendan grins and walks back toward his car. 
BRENDAN I love my coach! 
INT. BOARDWALK HALL LOBBY - SAME 
As WORKERS set up for the press conference and camera crews stake out their territory, Tommy and Paddy hug the corner of the room and wait. Not in their element at all. Moments later, Brendan comes walking through the doors. 
As he moves through the crowded room, Brendan and Tommy make eye contact. 
They haven't seen each other in 14 years, and judging by the looks on their faces they certainly didn't expect to see each other today. Paddy is just as shocked. 
Brendan begins to inch toward Tommy, but is intercepted by Frank, who was caught up in the media storm outside. 
FRANK Hey. Where'd you go? You can't leave me like that. They wanna talk to you, not me. 
Brendan looks past Frank. Tommy has risen and headed toward the exit, trailed by Paddy, who calls after him. 
EXT. RESORTS HOTEL AND CASINO - TWILIGHT 
The sun descends over the boardwalks and hotels of Atlantic City, and sinks into the sea. 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - SAME 
Paddy sits on a couch thumbing through a Sparta program and looks proudly at a PICTURE of Brendan. He listen to "Moby Dick" on his headphones as a TV plays in the foreground. 
ON TV SCREEN: LOCAL NEW JERSEY NEWS ANCHOR MICHELLE MOONEY SPEAKS OVER IMAGES OF THE RED CARPET EVENT AND PRESS CONFERENCE. 
MICHELLE MOONEY (ON SCREEN) ...the only fighter missing from the event was dark horse entry Tommy Riordan. 
ON TV SCREEN: A PICTURE OF TOMMY APPEARS ON THE SCREEN NEXT TO A PICTURE OF LANCE CORPORAL MARK BRADFORD. 
Paddy notices the picture of Tommy. Puts down the program and takes his headphones off. 
MICHELLE MOONEY (ON SCREEN) (CONT'D) Recent revelations that Riordan was not only a United States Marine but a hero in the Iraq War, has cast an even brighter spotlight on a fighter who seems to have come out of nowhere. (MORE) 
MICHELLE MOONEY (ON SCREEN) (CONT'D) Lance Corporal Mark Bradford's web testimony to Riordan, who saved his life earlier this year in Iraq, is spreading like wildfire throughout the media. 
Paddy stares at the screen intently. 
PADDY Tommy! 
ON TV SCREEN: MARK BRADFORD PEERS INTO A HAND-HELD CAMERA IN IRAQ AND SPEAKS. HE FIGHT BACK TEARS. 
BRADFORD (ON SCREEN) ...the bridge just crumbled. The Amtrack was upside down. Water was coming in from everywhere. The water pressure was too much. We couldn't get the back hatch open. 
ON TV SCREEN: BRADFORD HAS TO COMPOSE HIMSELF. 
BRADFORD (ON SCREEN) (CONT'D) We were all drowning, man. It was a death trap. 
Tommy walks into the room from the door of an adjoining suite and stares at the TV. 
BRADFORD (ON SCREEN) (CONT'D) I couldn't have had more than another minute. Suddenly the back ramp gets ripped off, and there he was. Before I could get out and thank him, he was gone. He just vanished like a ghost. 
Paddy is dumbfounded and looks at Tommy, who glances at him and back at the TV before heading toward the door. 
TOMMY I'm takin' a walk. 
ON TV SCREEN: THE CAMERA PUSHES IN ON BRADFORD'S FACE. HE SPEAKS DIRECTLY TO TOMMY. 
BRADFORD (ON SCREEN) You saved my life, brother. Anybody seeing this at Sparta, anybody out in Pittsburgh, reach out to Tommy Riordan. Tell him Mark said thank you. 
ON SCREEN: BACK TO THE NEWS STUDIO, AND THE PHOTO OF TOMMY. 
MICHELLE MOONEY (ON SCREEN) Footage taken from a helmet camera on the ground captured the heroic incident... 
ON SCREEN: THE GRAINY FOOTAGE SEEN EARLIER IN THE MARINE BARRACKS OF TOMMY AND THE SUBMERGED TANK. 
Then the phone RINGS. Paddy grabs it. 
PADDY (INTO PHONE) Hello? (BEAT) Brendan. 
TOMMY Shit. He's just some old vet I train with. He means nothing to me. From what I hear he means nothing to you, either, so you got balls talking about forgiveness. 
BRENDAN That's got nothing to do with forgiveness. I've got a family to protect. Everything I do is for them. 
Tommy smirks. Walks away again. 
BRENDAN (CONT'D) But I forgave Pop. Just like I forgave you and Mom. 
TOMMY (TURNING AROUND) You forgave us? 
BRENDAN Yeah. 
TOMMY I'm not surprised you made the tournament, Brendan. You got some stones. 
BRENDAN I fell in love, Tommy. What the hell was I supposed to do? 
TOMMY You were supposed to stick to the plan. You were supposed to come with us. Mom needed you. I needed you. You were my big brother and you bailed on me. 
The words hit Brendan hard. 
TOMMY (CONT'D) Hey, I'm glad you stayed and everything worked out for you, Brendan. See, you leave, you get the opposite. You leave, you get to bury people. 
BRENDAN You're not the only one who suffered, Tommy. I didn't even know she was sick. I never even got the chance to say goodbye to my own mother. You had no right to keep that from me! That was not your decision to make! 
TOMMY You know what? You walk around with your pictures in your wallet and you're all, I forgive you, I forgive Pop. I forgive everyone. But you know what? You're full of shit. 
Tommy and Brendan are right in each other's faces. Standing on the knife's edge of violence. They hold the stare down for a few long seconds, like two fighters about to go to war. 
TOMMY (CONT'D) Are we done, Brendan? Are we finished? 
Tommy and Brendan look at each other with burning intensity. Too much baggage and both too much and nothing left to say. Finally, Tommy turns and walks on down the beach. 
EXT. CENTRAL HIGH, PHILADELPHIA - DAY 
Sunny day. And a nearly abandoned school parking lot. 
INT. OUTER OFFICE - DAY 
Nash, Tito, and KC wait outside the Principal's office. It's quiet and aside from one SECRETARY, there's no one around. After a moment, Stephon comes walking in, and they all stand up and head into the Principal's office. 
INT. PRINCIPAL ZITO'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
The kids walk in. Zito looks up and shakes his head. 
JOE ZITO You realize you're supposed to seek my wise counsel when school's actually in session, right? 
All four of them laugh nervously. Working their way up to something. 
STEPHON We want to use the auditorium this weekend to watch Mr. C in Sparta. 
TITO What do you say? 
JOE ZITO Let me get this straight. You want to use the auditorium to watch a suspended teacher engage in the activity he was suspended for? Am I hearing this correctly? (BEAT) I gotta talk to your parents. You guys might need to be in summer school after all. 
NASH But everyone wants to see it. 
KC The gym's the only place that's big enough. 
JOE ZITO It's never gonna happen. 
STEPHON What if we get a petition? 
TITO Yeah. We'll get the whole school to sign it. 
NASH The power of democracy! 
JOE ZITO Look, I appreciate that you guys love your teacher. I really do. But there is nothing I can do for you. 
SHERIDAN (V.O.) (CONT'D) Great story, but I think your boy is about to be exposed as a YouTube sensation. 
ON TV SCREEN: REFEREE JOSH ROSENTHAL (30s) GIVES INSTRUCTIONS TO TOMMY AND HIS OPPONENT, FRANCISCO BARBOSA (20s). THE MUSCULAR BRAZILIAN DOESN'T HAVE A TRACE OF FEAR ON HIS FACE. 
INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA CAGE - SAME 
Tommy and Barbosa face to face as JOSH ROSENTHAL instructs. 
JOSH ROSENTHAL Gentlemen, you've been given your instructions. I expect a clean fight. Obey my commands at all times. Defend yourselves at all times. Touch gloves, go back, let's do this. 
In the crowd, two sections of MARINES in full dress uniforms wave flags and raise about as much hell as humanly possible for Tommy, who returns to his corner. Paddy attempts to give him some advice, but Tommy is not listening. 
CALLEN (V.O.) We're about to get the big answer to the big question: is Tommy Riordan for real? And here we go! 
The bell rings. DING! And Tommy comes out fast and hard. 
SHERIDAN (V.O.) Barbosa's gonna be looking for a take down. 
CALLEN (V.O.) Definitely gonna be looking for a take down. 
There will not be a take down. Tommy ducks a blow, then levels Barbosa with a massive and brutal LEFT HOOK. The Brazilian's head snaps sideways, his MOUTHPIECE goes flying, and he does a face plant on to the canvas. It's over. 
CALLEN (V.O.) Barbosa is down! Barbosa has been knocked out! Tommy Riordan is most definitely for real! 
As the crowd erupts and Josh Rosenthal waves to Barbosa's corner to get a medic in there, Tommy marches out of the cage without waiting for an official announcement. 
CALLEN (V.O.) And now he's walking out of the cage! He's leaving the cage! There goes another rule out the window! 
INT. COLT'S PITTSBURGH FIGHT CLUB - SAME 
Fenroy and the boys fired up. They can't believe the ferocious knockout they've just witnessed. 
SHERIDAN (V.O.) Francisco Barbosa is out cold, and he is out of this tournament, Bryan. 
INT. BRENDAN'S LOCKER ROOM - SAME 
The official pokes his head into the locker room where Frank and a nervous Brendan sit alone. 
OFFICIAL Show time. 
On the TV monitor, Tommy's annihilating knockout of Francisco Barbosa plays. Then, in the distance, the strains of CLASSICAL MUSIC can be heard. Brendan looks at Frank, who smiles and puts his hands on Brendan's shoulders. 
FRANK You can do this. 
He grabs the nervous Brendan's head between his hands. 
FRANK (CONT'D) I want to hear you say it. 
BRENDAN I can do this. 
FRANK Then let's go do this. 
INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER 
BUZZING in the crowd. Another fight close at hand. 
SHERIDAN (V.O.) J.J. Riley had less than 48 hours to fill Marco Santos' spot, and he basically had to rely on the word of Frank Campana. 
CALLEN (V.O.) And he chose Brendan Conlon, which quite frankly is something I just don't understand. 
Brendan and Frank walk down the tunnel toward the arena, where Paddy is waiting, his All Access pass around his neck. Brendan notices the old man as he approaches. 
PADDY Go get `em, son. 
Brendan barely acknowledges Paddy and keeps walking. Frank looks at Brendan with a "Who the hell is that?" expression. As they approach the dark lights of the arena, Beethoven continues to BOOM out over the loud speakers. 
CALLEN (V.O.) I can understand coming out to no music, by why in the world would you choose classical music for your entrance? 
Frank exhorts Brendan from cageside, telling him to relax, but it's no use. It's an unholy beating going in the cage. 
INT. PRINCIPAL ZITO'S LIVING ROOM - SAME 
Zito drinks a glass of Scotch. 
ON TV SCREEN: MIDNIGHT POUNDING ON BRENDAN. 
SHERIDAN (V.O.) Midnight is all over Brendan. 
CALLEN (V.O.) This can't last much longer. This won't last much longer. The teacher just has no answers. 
Zito leans forward. He looks as if he's going to have a heart attack. 
ZITO C'mon, Brendan, get outta there! 
INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA CAGE - SAME 
Midnight Le takes Brendan to the ground. Brendan tries to escape, but turns his back, allowing Midnight to sink in a rear naked CHOKE. He puts the strangle hold on Brendan and squeezes his neck with his enormous biceps. 
FRANK Get out of there! Get out of there! 
Brendan tries to pry Midnight's hands off him. No use. 
CALLEN (V.O.) And now he's got the hooks in. 20 seconds left. 
SHERIDAN (V.O.) The end is near. Can he make it to the end of the round is the question. 
Midnight squeezes for all it's worth as Frank screams at Brendan, imploring him not to tap. 
CALLEN (V.O.) 10 seconds left, and Brendan's face is turning purple. Conlon's whole world is about to go from day to night. 
Brendan is on the verge of going unconscious, but he refuses to tap out. Then the HORN blows ending the round. The crowd can't believe Brendan hung in there, and neither can Midnight Le, who slams the canvas in frustration. 
As Midnight walks back toward his angry TRAINER, who expected him to finish Brendan early, the teacher heads toward a smiling Frank. 
FRANK Beautiful! Beautiful! He doesn't know what hit him! 
Brendan grins at Frank's positive spin on things, then looks across the cage at Midnight Le, who glares at Brendan. 
INT. PRINCIPAL ZITO'S LIVING ROOM - LATER 
The frazzled Zito continues to root for Brendan. 
ON TV SCREEN: MORE OF THE SAME. MIDNIGHT ALL OVER BRENDAN. 
INT. TOMMY'S LOCKER ROOM - SAME 
An excited Paddy watches Brendan on the monitor. 
INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA CAGE - SAME 
Midnight continues pounding on Brendan, but Brendan starts giving back, working a few leg kicks of his own. He seems to be gaining confidence. From cageside, Frank HOLLERS words of encouragement as the battle continues. 
Back and forth they go. Midnight rocks Brendan with a right hand. Brendan recovers and fires back. Then Midnight shoots in for a take down, but Brendan dodges him, reverses position, and suddenly takes a shocked Midnight down to the ground. The crowd is on its collective feet. 
SHERIDAN (V.O.) He's got a Kimura locked in. 
CALLEN (V.O.) Are you kidding me? 
Brendan locks up Midnight's shoulder. Applies pressure. The bigger fighter struggles to get free, but he seems to be trapped. From cageside, Frank screams, instructing Brendan on how to finish the move. 
CALLEN (V.O.) Midnight is in big trouble! 
SHERIDAN (V.O.) I don't think he's got anywhere to go! 
CALLEN (V.O.) This isn't happening! This can't happen! 
INT. BRENDAN'S LOCKER ROOM - SAME 
Brendan and Frank stare at a monitor. They look worried. 
ON TV SCREEN: KOBA's OPPONENT GETTING ATTENDED TO AFTER THE BEATING BY THE MIGHTY RUSSIAN. 
INT. TOMMY'S LOCKER ROOM - LATER 
Tommy and Paddy sit on stools opposite each other, Paddy taping him up. Tommy keeps a lazy eye on a monitor, where Mad Dog Grimes is fighting. 
ON TV SCREEN: MAD DOG GRIMES, HIS MOHAWK DYED PLATINUM, KNOCKS OUT HIS OPPONENT IN BRUTAL FASHION. 
CALLEN (V.O.) Mad Dog fighting like a man possessed. Like a man with something to prove. 
ON TV SCREEN: MAD DOG MAKES A THROAT SLIT GESTURE DIRECTLY INTO THE CAMERA. 
SHERIDAN (V.O.) Mad Dog said he had a message for Tommy Riordan and there it is right there. 
INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA TUNNEL - LATER 
Brendan and Frank stand in the tunnel as the house lights go down in the arena. 
SHERIDAN (V.O.) Here comes the underdog, Brendan Conlon. 
CALLEN (V.O.) The teacher miraculously passed his first test, but now he's gotta face The Dane. 
Paddy stands amidst the crowd in the tunnel and gives Brendan a thumbs-up. 
PADDY You can do it, Brendan. 
Brendan glares at him and marches toward the cage. 
INT. BRENDAN AND TESS'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - LATER 
Tess, now watching the fights on TV, stands in front of the screen and bites her nails. She looks like she's about to throw up. 
ON TV SCREEN: BRENDAN TAKES A BEATING FROM KARL "THE DANE" KRULLER (30s), WHO POUNDS ON HIM WITHOUT MERCY. 
SHERIDAN (V.O.) Halfway through round three now and the beating continues. 
CALLEN (V.O.) I honestly don't know how Brendan Conlon is still standing, Sam. (MORE) 
CALLEN (V.O.) (CONT'D) He has been absolutely battered in both his fights tonight. 
INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA CAGE - SAME 
KARL "THE DANE" KRULLER presses Brendan against the fence and knees him repeatedly in the midsection. 
INT. BRENDAN AND TESS' HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME 
Tess can barely watch the beating. 
INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA CAGE - MOMENTS LATER 
Frank shouts instructions as Brendan and The Dane tangle against the fence. 
FRANK Take him down! 
Brendan grabs Kruller and FLIPS him to the canvas. Then he spins for an ARM BAR, a move similar to one seen earlier in the smoker fights. 
INT. PRINCIPAL ZITO'S LIVING ROOM - SAME 
Zito, now joined by his wife. Both on the edge of the couch and sucked into the action. 
INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA CAGE - SAME 
Brendan twists Kruller's arm. He's got him in a terrible position, much like Midnight. The Dane SQUIRMs. Looks for an escape. It's not there. With Brendan applying tremendous pressure to his arm, he TAPS. 
INT. COLT'S PITTSBURGH FIGHT CLUB - LATER 
The crowd at the gym both CHEERS and JEERS at the TV. 
ON TV SCREEN: MAD DOG GRIMES, SUPREMELY CONFIDENT, CLIMBS INTO THE CAGE AND GETS IN TOMMY'S FACE. HE HAS DYED HIS MOHAWK CAMOUFLAGE COLORS TO MOCK TOMMY. 
CALLEN (V.O.) Mad Dog Grimes has been looking for revenge ever since the day Tommy Riordan walked into his gym in Pittsburgh and turned his life upside down. 
SHERIDAN (V.O.) It's been a very long, very miserable few months for Mad Dog to say the least. 
INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA CAGE - SAME 
Mad Dog and Tommy in a STARE DOWN as Josh Rosenthal attempts to give them instructions. Unless Mad Dog's mother is in the building, every single person in the Boardwalk Hall is rooting for Tommy. 
CALLEN (V.O.) Mad Dog mocking Tommy with a camouflage motif for his mohawk tonight and the Marines are really letting Mad Dog have it. 
The Marines hoot and holler at Mad Dog as Josh Rosenthal goes over his instructions with the two fighters. 
JOSH ROSENTHAL Alright gentlemen, you've been given your instructions. I expect a clean fight. Obey my commands at all times. Defend yourselves at all times. Touch gloves, go back, let's do this. 
In the center of the cage, Mad Dog is practically spitting in Tommy's face. Tommy's eyelids droop. He could not be less intimidated. 
MAD DOG It's not gonna happen again. 
Callen and Sheridan look on as the two fighters retreat to their corners. The anticipation in the arena is incredible. 
CALLEN (V.O.) Mad Dog predicted an early knockout. Said he was gonna knock Tommy out with one punch. 
SHERIDAN (V.O.) Let's see what Tommy has to say about that. 
Josh Rosenthal looks at Tommy and Mad Dog. 
JOSH ROSENTHAL Gentlemen, you ready? You ready? Let's go to war! 
CALLEN (V.O.) And they are off! 
Tommy goes after Mad Dog like it's the last night on earth. What Tommy did to him at Colt's Gym was an exercise in restraint compared to what's happening in that cage. 
CALLEN (V.O.) Tommy tackles him and he's on top! He's raining blows! 
SHERIDAN (V.O.) Someone has to stop this. 
Mad Dog is on his back and being pounded on. Tommy's rage is shocking, even by his own brutal standards. From cageside, Colt Boyd SCREAMS at Josh Rosenthal. 
COLT BOYD Stop it! Stop the fight! 
It's such a savage beating, so malicious, that Rosenthal has to climb on Tommy's back to get him off of Mad Dog. If his mother is indeed in the crowd, she couldn't recognize him now. Beaten to an absolute pulp. 
CALLEN (V.O.) That's the fastest knockout I think I've ever seen. 
SHERIDAN (V.O.) Mad Dog Grimes has been poleaxed. He is not moving. 
Tommy marches out of the cage and past Colt Boyd, Punkass, and SkySkrape, who can't believe what they just witnessed. Neither can anyone else at Boardwalk Hall. In the cage, a MEDIC tends to Mad Dog. 
CALLEN (V.O.) I'll tell you what: you do that to someone on the street and they'd lock you up and throw away the key! Break out the yellow tape, Sam. Tommy's walking away from the cage like he's leaving a crime scene. 
EXT. STARLIGHT DRIVE-IN, PHILADELPHIA - LATER 
"ODE TO JOY" is heard coming from distant speakers as ROWS OF CARS line up at the entrance and pull into the lot. 
Pull back to reveal an enormous, old drive-in movie theater packed with a RAUCOUS CROWD. On the gigantic MOVIE SCREEN, Brendan makes his way through the arena and into the cage. As he does, CHEERS erupt in the parking lot. Stephon, Nash, KC, Tito, and some of the other students from Brendan's class root him on. They came up with a pretty good Plan B. 
As the kids get fired up for the fight, they're joined by a familiar face that emerges from the crowd. Joe Zito. Tito shakes his hand. Smacks Stephon. Look who's here. 
INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA - SAME 
Brendan climbs into the cage to a major OVATION from the crowd. They're completely on his side now. 
JOSH ROSENTHAL Let's go to war! 
Koba comes right after Brendan, and it's soon more of the same. Power slams. Brutal strikes. Brendan's face is carved up and battered. He tries to go for a take down, but Koba snuffs it, then lifts Brendan off the mat again and carries him through the air. Frank screams, but there's nothing he can do. Brendan is brutally SLAMMED into the ground. 
SHERIDAN (V.O.) Uh oh, Brendan's going for ride! 
CALLEN (V.O.) That one shook the entire building! 
As Brendan writhes on the ground, Koba grabs him and slings him against the fence like it's nothing. Brendan flies through the air and RATTLES against the cage. Then Koba climbs on top of him and starts whaling away. Tess can't even watch it. Once again, just as Rosenthal is about to stop the fight, the HORN sounds. 
SHERIDAN (V.O.) Everyone has gotta be concerned about Brendan Conlon's bravery getting him into trouble here. 
CALLEN (V.O.) His bravery can get him killed, Sam. He's got nothing more to prove. He's already lasted two rounds against Koba, which is more than anyone else can say. You wonder what's keeping this guy up. 
Brendan drags himself off the ground and limps to his stool. Frank enters the cage. His usual positive attitude is gone. He comes at Brendan with aggression instead. 
FRANK Sit down. Breathe. (grabbing Brendan's face) Look at me! Look at me! Why are we here, Brendan? Why are we here? Are we here to win this fight? You tell me, `cause if we're not, I'll throw in the towel right now. We'll get Tess and we will go home. You don't knock him out, you lose the fight. Understand me? You don't knock him out, you don't have a home. 
Josh Rosenthal claps his hands. Frank takes his cue to leave, but not before giving Brendan one last look. It's now or never. Brendan looks across the cage at Koba. Steels himself. 
JOSH ROSENTHAL Let's go to war! 
Brendan comes out and meets Koba in the center of the cage, but the Russian resumes his supremacy. 
CALLEN (V.O.) Conlon somehow answering the bell for round three, but Koba's all over him again. 
Koba roughs the battered Brendan up some more, but then Brendan starts responding. Throws a couple effective leg kicks. A decent punch or two. 
SHERIDAN (V.O.) Brendan's giving back, Bryan. There are signs of life in Brendan Conlon. He's starting to mix it up! 
EXT. STARLIGHT DRIVE-IN - MOMENTS LATER 
The parking lot is quiet and tense. Zito and the kids stare at the movie screen. 
ON MOVIE SCREEN: KOBA PRESSES BRENDAN UP AGAINST THE CAGE AND TRIES TO CHOKE HIM OUT. 
INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA CAGE - SAME 
The Russian SQUEEZES away. 
CALLEN (V.O.) Koba's got him caught in an iron vice, squeezing for all it's worth and trying to choke the teacher out. 
Frank screams at Brendan to stay calm. To wait for his moment. Koba continues to squeeze. Brendan's face turns more and more red. Finally, he grabs Koba's shorts, musters up all the strength he has left, and TOSSES the Russian on his back, freeing himself from the choke in the process. 
CALLEN (V.O.) He just launched Koba! Can you believe this? Conlon just shook off a guillotine! 
Brendan jumps on Koba and attempts his own choke. 
CALLEN (V.O.) Conlon's staying after him! He's squeezing him! The tables have turned, and the boy scout is squeezing the bear! 
Koba shakes off Brendan's submission attempt and stands. Brendan stands with him and they exchange a vicious round of blows. Brendan's giving as good as he's getting. 
SHERIDAN (V.O.) Conlon standing and trading with the Russian! I've never seen this! 
CALLEN (V.O.) This is a fight! We've got ourselves a fight! 
Brendan snaps Koba's head back with a left, but the Russian responds with a combination. Brendan stumbles backwards, and Koba grabs him and tries to take him down. Brendan throws a left ELBOW that connects with Koba's temple. The Russian is momentarily STUNNED, long enough for Brendan to take him to the ground and wrap his arms around Koba's KNEE. 
CALLEN (V.O.) Conlon going for a knee bar! He's got it very deep! 
SHERIDAN (V.O.) He's deep on that knee bar! 
Brendan wrenches his body for all it's worth. Frank pounds on the apron of the cage. 
FRANK Crank it! Crank it! 
The Russian tries to squirm away, but he can't. His face is contorted in PAIN. The cageside OFFICIAL indicates there's only 10 seconds left in the fight. 
BRENDAN I'm gonna fight him. 
INT. TOMMY'S LOCKER ROOM - SAME 
Tommy sits by himself in his locker room, the weight of the world pulling his shoulders down. His black hoodie is over his head. He couldn't be more alone. 
EXT. RESORTS HOTEL AND CASINO - SAME 
A sobered up Paddy runs out of the hotel and climbs into a waiting taxi. 
INT. BOARDWALK HALL - MOMENTS LATER 
Brendan and Frank make the long walk down the tunnel and into the arena. Unlike previous trips, there is no joy on their faces. It's a grim march to the cage. 
EXT. STARLIGHT DRIVE-IN - SAME 
People stand on cars. Chairs. Each other's shoulders. 
ON MOVIE SCREEN: THE BATTERED BRENDAN CONTINUES HIS WALK, WADING THROUGH A CROWD THAT IS AS PUMPED AS HE IS SOMBER. 
Tito, KC, Nash, Stephon, and the other students start chanting "Mis-ter C! Mis-ter C! Mis-ter C!" 
INT. TOMMY'S LOCKER ROOM - SAME 
Tommy rises and walks toward the door. 
INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA - CONTINUOUS 
He marches out the door and into the bowels of the arena, moving past MPS as he goes. His march is as grim as Brendan's. 
INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA CAGE - SAME 
Brendan and Frank embrace. 
FRANK One more time. 
Brendan climbs into the cage as the house LIGHTS DIM. The crowd is going bonkers. And they EXPLODE when Tommy appears at the end of the tunnel with his hoodie up and begins his march toward the cage. 
The Marines shower him with cheers and "Hoo-ahs." The girls scream. The rest of the audience stamps their feet and chants his name. But he acknowledges no one, and the hard look on his face never wavers. 
INT. COLT'S PITTSBURGH FIGHT CLUB - MOMENTS LATER 
Fenroy and the crew on the edge of their seats, all staring at the big screen. 
ON TV SCREEN: TOMMY GETTING GREASED UP AND CLIMBING INTO THE CAGE. 
INT. TAXI - SAME 
A nervous Paddy sits in the back of the cab as the DRIVER navigates through holiday traffic. 
INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA CAGE - SAME 
And here it is. The two brothers face to face in the middle of the ring, staring each other down. Tommy with his usual controlled fire, Brendan intense, searching his brother's eyes for some flicker of recognition. 
JOSH ROSENTHAL Gentlemen, this is the final. Five rounds. I expect a clean fight. Obey my commands at all times. Defend yourselves at all times. Touch gloves, go back, let's do this. 
As Rosenthal finishes his instructions, Brendan peers into Tommy's empty corner. 
BRENDAN Where's Pop? 
Tommy turns without answering. All business. Brendan returns to his corner. Looks at Tess. So much emotion on her face. 
JOSH ROSENTHAL Gentlemen, are you ready? Are you ready? Let's go to war! 
Tommy comes right after his brother. Just like with his previous three opponents. A natural wrecking machine. Frank screams at Brendan to stay calm, but Tommy is all over him, POUNDING on him with savage intensity. As bad as the other fights were for Brendan, this one is worse. 
EXT. STARLIGHT DRIVE-IN - SAME

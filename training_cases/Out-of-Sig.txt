BLACK 
We hear TRAFFIC, some STREET NOISES, then... 
FADE IN: A MIAMI STREET - DAY 
The financial district.  Lots of people in suits.  A shaky, spasmodic ZOOM IN finds... 
JACK FOLEY -- forty, big, focused expression -- as he rips a tie from around his neck and throws it down in the gutter.  He starts across the street, now peeling off his suitcoat and dropping that, too, right there on the asphalt as we then... 
WHIP PAN OVER TO REVEAL: A BANK ACROSS THE STREET 
As Foley goes inside, we then... 
CUT TO: A PRINTED BROCHURE THAT READS... 
LOOKING FOR MONEY? 
YOU'VE COME TO THE RIGHT PLACE. 
We then PULL BACK TO REVEAL that we're now... 
INSIDE THE BANK 
as Foley stands at a counter holding the above CREDIT APPLICATION while he studies the bank layout. 
Foley watches a MAN IN A SUIT, carrying an attache-case, enter the bank and move through the gate into the fenced-off business area at the front.  An EXECUTIVE rises from his desk, shakes hands with the man and they both sit down. 
Foley rosses the brochure in the trash, then crosses to a teller window where a nameplate on the counter tells us the young woman with the pile of dark hair smiling at him is LORETTA. 
TELLER/LORETTA How can I help you, sir? 
FOLEY Loretta, you see that guy talking to your manager, has his case open? 
Foley takes out a ZIPPO LIGHTER and casually, yet expertly, begins to fiddle with it as the teller looks across the bank. 
LORETTA That's Mr. Guindon, one of our assistant managers.  Our manager is Mr. Schoen, but he's not in today. 
FOLEY But you see the guy with the attache case? 
LORETTA (looks again) Yes. 
FOLEY That's my partner.  He has a gun in there.  And if you don't do exactly what I tell you, or you give me any kind of a problem, I'll look over at my partner and he'll shoot your Mr. Guindon between the eyes. 
Loretta goes stiff, swallows, stares back at Foley. 
FOLEY (CONT'D) Now take one of those big envelopes and put as many hundreds, fifties and twenties as you can pack into it. Nothing with bank straps or rubber bands.  I don't want any dye packs.  I don't want any bait money.  Start with the second drawer and then the one over there, under the computer.  Come on, Loretta, the key's right there next to you.  No bills off the bottom of the drawer. (as she works) First time being robbed? (she nods) You're doing great.  Just smile, Loretta, so you won't look like you're being held up. (she smiles awkwardly) That's the way, you're doing fine. 
We hear a bit of thunder and Foley cuts a fast look out the front door.  When he turns back, he sees that Loretta's having some trouble fitting all the bills into the envelope. 
FOLEY (CONT'D) Here, give me the twenties.  I'll put 'em in my pocket.  Okay, I haven't had to give my partner a sign; that's good. Now, he's gonna wait thirty seconds till after I'm out the door, make sure you haven't set off the alarm.  If you have, he's gonna shoot Mr. Guindon between the eyes.  Okay?  I think that'll do it.  Thank you, Loretta, and have a nice day. 
LORETTA You, too. 
Foley heads for the door.  He pauses by Mr. Guindon's desk, looks back at Loretta.  Foley smiles at her, then turns to the Man sitting with Mr. Guindon, indicates Loretta... 
FOLEY She's cute, isn't she? 
The man looks across the bank at Loretta. 
MAN Uh, yeah, I guess so. 
Foley winks at Loretta and walks out. 
MAN (CONT'D) (to Mr. Guindon) Who was that? 
EXT. BANK - SAME 
As Foley comes out, he calmly walks to a Honda Civic and gets in. 
INT. CAR - SAME 
As Foley tries to start the car.  No go.  He tries again. 
FOLEY Come on... 
But the car won't start.  Foley bangs on the wheel... 
FOLEY (CONT'D) Fuck! 
Foley then stiffens as a cop sticks his gun through the open window into Foley's ear... 
COP I think you flooded it. 
Foley looks to the passenger window, where ANOTER COP, smiling, now has his gun pointing at him. 
SECOND COP Get out've the car, sir. 
FOLEY Wanna hear a funny story? 
SECOND COP Shut up and get out've the car. 
And as Foley obliges, we then... 
FADE TO WHITE. 
We hear a MAN GRUNT.  Then see Foley in SLOW MOTION as he jumps through frame, now we see a basketball come up in his hand as we realize he's on his way to the rim when... 
...ANOTHER GUY rams into him in mid-air, knocks him down. 
ADELE Till it's not funny any more.  What do you want, Jack? 
FOLEY You know that Super Bowl party?  They changed the date.  It's on tonight, eight-thirty. 
ADELE Didn't you tell me one-time calls aren't monitored? 
FOLEY I said not as a rule. 
ADELE So why don't you come right out and tell me what you're talking about? 
FOLEY Listen to Miss Smarty Mouth.  Out there in the free world. 
ADELE What's free about it?  I'm looking for work. 
FOLEY What happened to Mandrake the Magician? 
ADELE Emil the Amazing.  The bastard fired me and hired another girl, a redhead. I'm working on a new business card, pass out to the cafes.  How's this sound-- 
FOLEY (cuts her off) Listen, Adele, the reason I called, that party is today instead of Sunday. About eight-thirty, like only a few hours from now.  So you'll have to get hold of Buddy, whatever he might be doing... 
ADELE And the one driving the other car? 
FOLEY What're you talking about? 
ADELE Well, seeing as you have so much luck with cars, Buddy thought it might be better to bring two.  He got this guy he says you know from Lompoc, Glenn something. 
FOLEY Glenn Michaels. 
ADELE Yeah, that's him.  Buddy says Glenn thinks you guys are real cool. 
FOLEY He did, huh.  Well, tell Buddy I see Glenn wearing his sunglasses I'll step on 'em.  I might not even take 'em off first. 
INT. RESTAURANT - DAY 
As MARSHALL SISCO -- fifty -- slides a small wrapped box across a table... 
MARSHALL Happy birthday. 
...to where KAREN SISCO -- twenty-eight, black suit, long hair, a knockout -- sits.  She picks up the box and shakes it. 
KAREN You fit another Chanel suit in here? 
MARSHALL Something better.  Open it. 
Karen starts to carefully unwrap the present.  Marshall watches, takes a sip of his drink, looks around the bar, sees how everyone's looking at the two of them... 
KAREN (opens the box) Oh my God... 
She pulls a gleaming automatic pistol from the box... 
KAREN (CONT'D) It's beautiful. 
MARSHALL It's a -- 
KAREN --Sig-Sauer .38.  I love it. 
She leans across the table and kisses him. 
KAREN (CONT'D) Thanks, Dad. 
MARSHALL Happy birthday, kid. (then) You want another Coke? 
KAREN (checks her watch) Can't.  I gotta drive out to Glades, then I'm meeting Ray Nicolet at ten. 
MARSHALL Which one is that?  The ATF guy? 
KAREN He was.  Ray's with the F.B.I. now, he switched over. 
MARSHALL He's still married though, huh? 
KAREN Technically.  They're separated. 
MARSHALL Oh, he's moved out? 
KAREN He's about to. 
MARSHALL Then they're not separated, are they? 
KAREN Can we change the subject? 
MARSHALL What're you doing at Glades? 
KAREN Serving process, a Summons and Complaint.  Some con doing mandatory life doesn't like macaroni and cheese. He files suit, says he has no choice in what they serve and it violates his civil rights. 
MARSHALL You know you can always step in, work with me full-time as one of my investigators. 
KAREN No thanks. 
MARSHALL You used to like it. 
KAREN Dad... 
MARSHALL You'd meet doctors, lawyers -- nothing wrong with them necessarily if they're divorced.  Why settle for some cowboy cop who drinks too much and cheats on his wife?  That's the way those hotshots are, all of 'em. 
KAREN I really gotta go. 
MARSHALL We don't get to talk much any more. 
KAREN How 'bout I come next Sunday and watch the Super Bowl with you? 
MARSHALL I'd like that. 
She gets up, kisses him again. 
KAREN Thanks for the gun, Dad. 
INT. FOLEY'S CELL - BELLE GLADE - DAY 
Foley comes in, lies down on the bunk.  He looks about the cell.  All he's got to show for himself.  It's now quiet on the cellblock.  Foley closes his eyes and we... 
CUT TO: EXT. PRISON AUDITORIUM 
A few hundred cons scream encouragement/insults as MAURICE "SNOOPY" MILLER, a lanky, scary, mean-looking black man in boxing trunks, hits a white guy with a ferocious hook. 
KAREN How many was that? 
FOLEY Tell you the truth, I don't know.  I started when I was eighteen, driving for my Uncle Cully and his partner, Gus.  They go into a bank this one time in Slidell, Gus jumps the counter to get the tellers and breaks his leg. All three of us ended up in Angola. 
KAREN That's funny. 
FOLEY I thought so, too. 
KAREN It was me, I woulda left ol' Gus on the floor. 
FOLEY I believe you would have.  Another fall, I did seven years at Lompoc.  And I don't mean the place next door where some of Nixon's people went. 
KAREN I know the difference.  You were in Lompoc USP, the federal penitentiary. I've delivered people there.  So basically you've spent half your life in prison. 
FOLEY (beat) Basically.  Yeah.  If I go back now, I do a full thirty years, no time off. Can you imagine looking at that? 
KAREN I don't have to.  I don't rob banks. 
He looks at her, then looks away as we... 
EXT. CAR - SAME 
As the car turns into a main highway now... 
INT. TRUNK - SAME 
As Foley plays the light down the length of her... 
FOLEY You don't seem all that scared. 
KAREN Of course I am. 
FOLEY You don't act like it. 
KAREN What do you want me to do?  Scream?  I don't think it would help much. (then) I'm just gonna sit back, take it easy, and wait for you to screw up. 
FOLEY Jesus, you sound like my ex-wife. 
KAREN You were married?  All those falls, I'm surprised you had time. 
FOLEY It was just a year, give or take a few days.  I mean, it's not like we didn't get along or anything.  We had fun, we just didn't have that... that thing, you know?  That spark, you know what I mean?  You gotta have that. 
KAREN (thinking) Uh-huh. 
FOLEY We still talk, though. 
KAREN Sure. 
EXT. CAR - SAME 
As Buddy passes a sign that says "MIAMI, 74 MILES." 
INT. TRUNK - SAME 
As she tries to get a look at him... 
KAREN You know, this isn't gonna end well, these things never do. 
FOLEY Yeah, well, if it turns out I get shot like a dog, it'll be in the street, not off a goddamn fence. 
KAREN You must see yourself as some kind of Clyde Barrow. 
And for a few moments, all we hear is the sound of the car on the road.  Then... 
FOLEY Oh, you mean of Bonnie and Clyde?  Hm. You ever see pictures of him, the way he wore his hat?  You could tell he had that don't-give-a-shit air about him. 
KAREN I don't recall his hat, but I've seen pictures of him lying dead, shot by Texas Rangers.  Did you know he didn't have his shoes on? 
FOLEY Is that right? 
KAREN They put a hundred and eighty-seven bullet holes in Clyde, Bonnie Parker and the car they were driving.  Bonnie was eating a sandwich. 
FOLEY You're full of interesting facts, aren't you? 
KAREN It was May, 1934, near Gibsland, Louisiana. 
EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT 
Quiet.  Empty.  A moment later the car flies past. 
INT. TRUNK - SAME 
FOLEY That part in the movie where they get shot?  Warren Beatty and... I can't think of her name. 
KAREN Faye Dunaway. 
FOLEY Yeah, I liked her in that movie about TV... 
KAREN Network.  Yeah, she was good. 
FOLEY And the guy saying he wasn't gonna take any more shit from anybody... 
KAREN Peter Finch. 
FOLEY Yeah, right.  Anyway, that scene where Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway get shot?  I remember thinking at the time it wouldn't be a bad way to go, if you have to. 
KAREN Bleeding on a country road. 
FOLEY It wasn't pretty after, no, but if you were in that car -- eating a sandwich -- you wouldn't have known what hit you. 
We HEAR FAINT SIRENS OS... 
INT. CAR - SAME TIME 
As Buddy sees FLASHING LIGHTS approach from the opposite direction.  He stays cool as the green and whites get closer... closer... then fly right on past. 
INT. TRUNK - SAME 
As the SIRENS SCREAM AT US FOR A MOMENT, then FADE. 
FOLEY You're sure easy to talk to.  I wonder -- say we met under different circumstances and got to talking, say you were in a bar and I came up to you -- I wonder what would happen. 
KAREN Nothing. 
EXT. TOP OF OVERPASS - NIGHT 
As Glenn removes a note stuck in the side window of a stolen Audi that reads "GONE TO GET GAS." 
FOLEY Have your clothes cleaned and send me the bill. 
Glenn looks over as the three of them reach the top of the grade, move through the scrub.  Glenn leans against the car, flashers blinking. 
KAREN I'll send it to you at Glades. 
GLENN Jesus, what'd you crawl through, a sewer? 
FOLEY Take your sunglasses off. 
GLENN I see better with them on. 
FOLEY You don't take 'em off, I'm gonna throw 'em off the overpass while they're still on your head. 
Glenn shrugs, takes them off and sticks them in his jeans. 
FOLEY (CONT'D) Wait in the car. 
GLENN You're in civilization now, man, ease up. 
FOLEY I'd like you to go wait in the car. How's that?  Take her with you and put her in back. 
GLENN In the trunk? 
FOLEY The backseat. 
Foley stares at him, waiting.  Glenn motions to Karen... 
GLENN Come on.  I have to do what I'm told. 
She walks past Foley without looking at him. 
FOLEY Wait a minute.  Let me have your raincoat. (looks at Buddy) Somebody forgot to bring me clean clothes. 
BUDDY I brought 'em, they're back at Glades in the Cadillac.  You wanted to take her car. 
KAREN You can blame me if you want.  I don't mind. 
He doesn't say anything as Glenn takes off the raincoat, folds it up, then throws it at Foley's feet. 
GLENN Here you are, sir. 
Foley watches as Glenn gets his sunglasses out, puts them back on and takes Karen by the arm. 
BUDDY What's wrong with you? 
Karen looks over at Foley, then ducks her head and gets in the backseat. 
FOLEY Why you brought Glenn into this, I'll never know. 
BUDDY How 'bout the score was his idea to begin with? 
FOLEY His idea?  Gimme a break.  Fuckin' guy's got a vacant lot for a head.  Was you and me figured the whole thing out. 
Buddy watches Foley struggle with the buttons on the uniform, all of them caked with muck. 
BUDDY You're pulling at it.  Here... 
He lays the shotgun in the grass and comes up, takes the guard shirt in his two hands and rips it open, popping buttons and tearing the shirt. 
FOLEY I don't know why, but every time he opens his mouth I want to punch him out. 
BUDDY He ain't the problem, Jack. 
Foley looks at him. 
BUDDY (CONT'D) You wanna pull your head outta your ass and tell me why we're bringing her with us? 
INT. CAR - SAME 
As Karen watches Glenn get into the car, sees him as the dome light comes on for a second or two before he closes the door. He half turns, laying his arm along the top of the seats, runs his hand through his hair... 
GLENN ...if he thinks he can talk to me like this.  Shit, I don't even know what I need them for. 
Karen leans forward to have a look, sees Foley and Buddy against the dark foliage. 
GLENN (CONT'D) I got a big score lined up up north. They wouldn't even know about it, it wasn't for me.  I could do it right now myself, except it's so fucking cold up there in January-- 
KAREN Glenn? 
His head turns so that we can see his designer shades. 
KAREN (CONT'D) You don't remember me, do you? 
GLENN (beat) It couldn't have been out at Glades, if that's what you're thinking.  I was never out there. 
KAREN No, that's not what I'm thinking. 
He raises his hand, strokes his hair away from his face. 
GLENN But you're sure we've met, huh? 
KAREN Last fall, I drove you from the Palm Beach county jail to the federal courthouse, twice.  You're Glenn Michaels. (then) I never forget anyone I've cuffed and shackled. 
He doesn't move or say a word, staring at her now like he's been turned to stone. 
KAREN (CONT'D) Let's think for a minute, Glenn, see if we can work this out... 
He turns away, all the way around to look straight ahead... 
KAREN (CONT'D) Do we have a gun in the car? 
GLENN I remember you now.  Shit. 
KAREN Foley's not going to make it.  And if he goes down, Glenn, you go with him. 
She touches his shoulder and he jumps. 
KAREN (CONT'D) Look, I can understand if you and Foley are close. 
Ripley turns back to Foley now: Also a good point. 
FOLEY You stick anything in this guy, Snoop, they transfer his ass outta here faster'n you can throw a fight, and you still end up with nothing. 
Ripley nods, takes this in. 
MAURICE This doesn't concern you, Foley.  Why don't you go on out to the yard, have yourself a smoke? 
FOLEY I don't smoke. 
HIMEY (slowly rising) You heard the man.  Go on outta here. 
Foley doesn't move, just gives the guy a bored once over. 
MAURICE Himey here's a pro-toh-jay of mine. He's ranked number thirty-two in the federal prison system. 
FOLEY (looking at Himey) Thirty-two outta what, twenty? 
Himey bulldozes forward, pulling his massive fist back to clock Foley in the head when... 
...in one swift motion Foley brings his book up in one hand, like he's throwing a pie, and drives the hefty repair manual into Himey's face, snapping the big guy's head back, sending his feet flying out from under him so that he hits the floor back-first with a loud thud. 
Maurice goes for Foley who picks up the chair just as we hear A WHISTLE.  They all freeze, look to... 
A PRISONER AT ANOTHER TABLE 
Who nods towards the door.  We PAN OVER just as A GUARD APPEARS, takes in the scene as a dazed Himey slowly pulls himself up, covers his now bleeding nose. 
GUARD What's going on here? 
MAURICE Oh, you know, reading's funnamental an' shit, we just excited. 
GUARD Clear outta here. 
The guard exits.  Maurice and Foley are still staring at each other. 
RIPLEY Excuse me.  Snoopy?  Did we settle the fish thing? 
MAURICE (looks at Foley) Yeah.  Sure.  It's all settled. 
He pours the water out of the bag and drops the fish into Ripley's open hand.  Maurice then squeezes Ripley's hand into a fist, crushing the fish.  He taps his fist to Ripley's. 
RIPLEY That's how you do it. 
Maurice gives Foley a last look, starts out of the room with Himey.  Ripley looks at the crushed fish in his hand, then at Foley. 
RIPLEY Thanks for your help. 
FOLEY Any time. 
We hear a PHONE RING and then... 
CUT TO: MAURICE MILLER'S HOUSE - THE BEDROOM - (NOW) 
As Maurice lies in bed watching a boxing match on television. 
MAURICE Stick and jab, fool.  Stick and jab. 
A frisbee whizzes past the television.  We hear A DOG YELP OS. 
MAURICE (CONT'D) Hey!  Watch that shit! 
Maurice's girlfriend MOSELLE - about thirty, sleepy-eyed, in a green bathrobe - picks the frisbee up off the floor as THE PHONE RINGS AWAY on the bedside table right next to Maurice. 
MOSELLE (calls OS) Tuffy.  C'mere, boy... 
MAURICE You gonna answer the phone? 
MOSELLE What for?  It's not for me. 
Maurice watches as Moselle now tries to throw the frisbee to a little wire-haired terrier, but it just bounces off the dog's head. 
MOSELLE (CONT'D) Bad dog. 
MAURICE (scoops up the dog) Moselle, the fuck are you doing to my little Tuffy? 
He lovingly nuzzles the dog like it's his child. 
MOSELLE I'm trainin' Tuffy, so he can be on a Kal Kan commercial, make us some extra money. 
He looks at her. 
MAURICE That's the dumbest thing I heard in my life.  Everybody knows Kal Kan doesn't pay for shit.  You gonna get a gig, it's gotta be for one of the big three: Science Diet, Iams or that Cycle shit for the fat dogs.  Now answer the fuckin phone. 
She comes over, picks up the phone. 
MOSELLE Hello? (hands it to Maurice) For you. 
MAURICE (takes it) This is me. 
EXT. PHONE BOOTH - GAS STATION - NIGHT 
An antsy Glenn with his shades on talks on the phone. 
GLENN Snoopy.  Glenn Michaels. 
INTERCUTTING GLENN & MAURICE: 
MAURICE Studs.  Hey, son, you must be one a them psychic friends.  I was just thinkin' about you. 
Glenn watches as some guy in a suit gets out of a black Lincoln Town Car and jogs to the john. 
GLENN Listen, Snoopy, I'm on my way up to Detroit and need a place to crash. 
MAURICE You crazy, come up here?  It's fuckin one degree outside. 
GLENN I wanna talk to you about a job. 
MAURICE Uh-huh. 
GLENN I can't really go into it right now. I'll just tell you it's someone big. 
MAURICE Someone?  Gimme a hint. 
BURDON Yes, but I want to hear you tell it. Starting with when you tried to grab the wheel -- where was this? 
KAREN Coming to the Okeechobee exit... 
And now we see it... 
INSIDE THE CAR 
Going over a hundred miles per hour, blowing past cars... 
KAREN Take the next exit. 
GLENN What am I supposed to do now? 
KAREN Glenn, take the exit. 
GLENN No way, man, no fuckin' way am I gonna turn myself in. 
She reaches over and grabs the wheel. 
GLENN (CONT'D) The fuck are you doing?! 
He hits the brakes.  The car goes off the road, down the grade, the abutment coming right at us as we go back to... 
THE HOSPITAL ROOM 
As Burdon sets the file down, sits back now. 
KAREN The next thing I knew, the paramedics were taking me out the car. 
Burdon looks at Karen a moment, then... 
BURDON There's a couple of points I keep wondering about have to do with the two guys that grabbed you.  Buddy is it?  And this fella Jack Foley.  I swear the man must've robbed two hundred banks in his time. 
KAREN Really?  Huh.  He told me he didn't remember how many he robbed. 
BURDON You talked to him? 
KAREN In the trunk, yeah? 
BURDON What'd you talk about? 
KAREN Oh... different things, prison, movies. 
BURDON This fella holds you hostage, you talk about movies? 
KAREN It was an unusual experience. 
BURDON Foley made me think of that fella Carl Tillman, the one you were seeing, it turns out the same time he was doing banks.  You recall that? 
KAREN When I was seeing Carl Tillman, I didn't know he robbed banks. 
BURDON Yeah, but I had enough reason to believe he did, and I told you.  So you had to at least suspect him. 
KAREN And what happened to Carl? 
BURDON The time came, you shot him.  But you didn't shoot Foley or the guy with him.  They're unarmed, you had a shotgun and you let them throw you in the trunk. Okay, now you got your Sig in your hand.  You say in the report you couldn't turn around, he had you pinned down.  But when the trunk opened, how come you didn't cap the two guys then? 
KAREN Is that what you would've done? 
BURDON You say in the report Glenn didn't have a gun, but you let him get away, too. 
KAREN Daniel, what do you work on most of the time, fraud?  Go after crooked bookkeepers. 
BURDON Karen, I've been with the Bureau fifteen years, on all kinds of investigations. 
KAREN Have you ever shot a man?  How many times have you been primary through the door? 
BURDON I have to qualify, is that it? 
KAREN You have to know what you're talking about. 
We hear CHUCKLING OS.  Burdon glances at the doorway where we see Marshall now standing, enjoying this. 
BURDON We'll talk another time, Karen.  All right?  I'd like to know why Foley put you in that second car when he didn't need you any more. 
KAREN You'll have to ask him. 
BURDON Sounds to me like he liked having you around.  I'll see you, Karen.  Mr. Sisco. 
MARSHALL Agent Burdon. 
Marshall waits for him to walk out... 
MARSHALL (CONT'D) The white man's Burdon.  That's what everybody calls him in Miami.  The Metro-Dade guys.  He's got a knack for pissing people off. 
She's not listening.  He sits down, takes her hand... 
MARSHALL (CONT'D) What are you thinking about? 
KAREN The Sig Sauer you got me for my birthday. 
MARSHALL Tell you what, you're a good girl, you might get another one for Christmas. 
She looks at him. 
KAREN I'll get it back when I get Foley. 
EXT. BUDDY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY 
A dozen GERIATRIC RESIDENTS sit on chairs out front as Buddy climbs the steps carrying a bag of groceries under one arm, newspaper under the other.  An old woman comes out the door as Buddy opens it and squints at him. 
OLD WOMAN Oh--  Are you delivering the oxygen? 
BUDDY Uh, no, ma'am.  Sorry. 
INT. BUDDY'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Buddy's REAL apartment, not the one Karen pictured in her dream. This one's nicer, with a view of the beach.  Jack stands on the balcony going through KAREN'S PURSE. 
He pulls out her wallet, checks out her driver's licence photo. He does the same with her gym I.D. card.  He finds her address book and opens it up.  A photo of her father slips out.  Jack examines it a moment, then flips through the book. 
He stares at something in her bag a moment, then reaches in and comes up with her us Marshal I.D.  He slips it open and studies the badge and the picture opposite. 
KAREN Was it Foley? 
Marshall looks at her. 
RAY Foley?  Oh.  No, it was one of the Cubans.  Linares. 
KAREN Oh... 
RAY We went out there, full SWAT, two choppers, the whole bit, but Linares started shooting anyway.  We put him down, but somehow Chirino got away. 
MARSHALL Did you pay the guy the reward? 
RAY Yeah, as soon as we got back. 
KAREN Foley hadn't been there? 
Her father gives her a look. 
RAY This place was strictly Cuban.  If Foley had a ride he must have his own agenda. He seems to be the only one knows what he's doing. 
THE PHONE RINGS.  Marshall moves to it. 
MARSHALL Hello? (beat) Yeah, she is.  Just a minute. (hands her the phone) For you. 
KAREN Hello? 
CUT TO: FOLEY ON THE PHONE - DAY 
On the balcony.  Flipping through a copy of Vogue while Buddy watches television inside. 
FOLEY Hi. 
INTERCUTTING KAREN & FOLEY - DAY 
Karen just stands there, sees her father looking at her as Ray drones on. 
FOLEY You know who this is? 
KAREN Yes. 
She walks out to her father's balcony now. 
FOLEY I just wanted to see if you're okay, make sure Glenn didn't hurt you or, you know, anything. 
MARSHALL Something I've been wondering, Ray... 
Marshall picks up the newspaper... 
MARSHALL (CONT'D) It says in the headline, "I slept with a murderer, says shaken Miami woman." She lives in Little Havana, her husband's out of town working when one of the escapees shows up at her door... 
She closes the glass door, so that they won't hear her. 
KAREN How'd you get this number? 
FOLEY Who was it answered the phone? 
KAREN None of your business. 
FOLEY I'm just worried maybe I'm not old enough for you. 
KAREN That's my dad. 
FOLEY Really.  He has a cop's face. 
KAREN How do you know?  Wait-- you have my wallet. 
FOLEY And your gun. 
KAREN Think I could have them back? 
FOLEY How do we do that? 
KAREN Let's see.  You could come on by my dad's place, drop 'em off. 
FOLEY Sure.  I'll just leave 'em with the S.W.A.T. guy answers the door. 
Foley stops flipping through the magazine, stares at what he's been looking for: an ad for Defiance perfume. 
KAREN There's a guy here on the task force right now.  Maybe I should put him on the phone, let you two work it out. 
FOLEY You won't do that. 
KAREN Why not? 
FOLEY Because you're having too much fun. 
She doesn't know what to say to that.  Foley smells the ad. 
INSIDE THE HOUSE 
MARSHALL ...She fixes him pork chops and rice, the next thing you know they're making love on the sofa.  She says he was very gentle. 
RAY I spoke to her.  The guy told her he missed his little girl and she felt sorry for him. 
MARSHALL That's how you score now? 
ON THE PATIO: 
Karen looks inside at her father talking with Ray Nicolet. 
KAREN My dad's retired.  He was a Private Investigator.  Forty years.  I used to work for him. 
FOLEY I can just picture that, a cute girl like you following slip-and-fall and whiplash cheaters. 
KAREN Something I've been wondering, what ever happened to your Uncle Cully? 
FOLEY Why?  You think he might tell you where I am? 
KAREN Unless you wanna tell me. 
FOLEY He's dead.  He did twenty-seven years before he came out and died not too long after in Charity Hospital, I think trying to make up for all the good times he'd missed. (then) That's not gonna be me. 
KAREN One last score, that the idea?  Move to some island. 
FOLEY I'm a tourist. 
BUDDY You at least bring the gun? 
FOLEY (lifts straw bag) In here with my suntan lotion and beach towel. (points) That's her place. 
As they drive past, Buddy indicates a MAN on the steps out front, obviously FBI... 
BUDDY There.  You see the guy sitting on the porch?  The old ladies and one guy? You know they'll have a couple more in a car somewhere. 
FOLEY (watching something else) Uh-huh... 
Buddy follows Foley's gaze to... 
ACROSS THE STREET 
As a car door opens and Karen Sisco gets out, rifles her purse for change.  She drops a quarter, Foley now watching as she bends down to grab it, her skirt hiking way up her thigh... 
BUDDY Oh, my. 
Foley watches, her hair in her face as she tries to reach under the car and grab it. 
BUDDY (CONT'D) Okay, you saw her.  That's all you get. 
They watch as she walks to the Normandie and shows the YOUNG AGENT her ID... 
FOLEY I guess Adele's in good hands. 
BUDDY Sure looks that way. 
FOLEY (finally) Let's go to Detroit. 
BUDDY Now you're talkin'. 
INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE ADELE'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Adele has the chain on the door, talks to Karen through the narrow opening. 
ADELE You were both in the trunk?  Together? 
KAREN From Glades to the turnpike.  Then I left with Glenn. 
Karen watches Adele's face in the opening, freshly made up, heavy on the eye shadow and lip gloss. 
KAREN The FBI didn't tell you I was with them? 
ADELE They didn't tell me anything, they asked questions. 
KAREN But you know what I'm talking about, don't you?  About Glenn, don't you, and the second car? 
ADELE I know a Glenn. 
She thinks a moment.  The door closes and opens again, all the way.  Adele stands there in a robe, hanging partly open, panties, but no bra. 
ADELE (CONT'D) I'm getting ready to go out.  You can come in if you want, sit down for a minute.  Would you like a Diet Coke? 
KAREN No, thanks. 
She comes in, checks out the place.  She turns a chair from the glasstop table and sits down as Adele comes out of the kitchenette with a Diet Coke and packet of cigarettes. 
ADELE Those are cute shoes.  The kind of jobs I get, I have to wear these killer spikes, they ruin your feet. 
She walks away, comes back with an ashtray. 
ADELE (CONT'D) When you were in the trunk with Jack... 
Karen waits, watches her light her cigarette. 
ADELE (CONT'D) He didn't hurt you or anything, did he? 
KAREN You mean, did he try to jump me?  No, but he was kind of talkative. 
ADELE He gets that way when he's nervous sometimes. 
Adele sits down at the other end of the table. 
KAREN You didn't visit him in prison. 
ADELE He didn't want me to. 
KAREN Why not? 
ADELE I don't know.  He was different after he was sentenced, looking at thirty years.  Said it depressed him every time the younger cons called him an old timer. 
KAREN But you spoke to him on the phone. 
ADELE He'd call every once in a while. 
KAREN He called the day he escaped. 
ADELE He did?  I don't remember.  Did he say about me?  In the trunk? 
KAREN (beat, lies) He said he wished the two of you could start over, live a normal life. 
ADELE Huh.  Problem is, Jack's idea of a normal life is robbing banks.  It's all he's ever done. 
KAREN Did you know that when you married him? 
ADELE He said he was a card player.  I could live with that.  I never knew he robbed banks till he got busted with that car that caught fire -- if you can imagine something like that happening, comes out of the bank and the car's on fire. I did go see him in jail to tell him I was filing for divorce.  He said, "Okay."  Jack's so easy going. (then) He was fun, but never what you'd call a real husband. 
Adele looks out the window.  Karen waits, looks to an end table where she sees a photograph of Jack and Adele on a boat somewhere ten years back. 
ADELE (CONT'D) I'll say one thing for Jack, he was never ugly or mean, or drank too much. He was very considerate, lights on or off, if you know what I mean. 
KAREN Really. (looking at the picture) Hm. 
She realizes Adele is looking at her. 
KAREN (CONT'D) Adele, sooner or later, he's gonna get caught.  I'd like to get him before he does something else, makes it worse on himself. 
ADELE Buddy'll take care of him.  Keep him out've trouble.  He's Jack's conscience. Always has been. (chuckles) He tell you how they met? 
Karen shakes her head. 
KAREN (CONT'D) You can live or die, it's up to you. 
CHINO Oh, is that right?  You going to shoot me?  Nice girl like you? (smiles) I don't think so. 
KAREN You don't, huh? 
And with that, she kicks him in the knee.  Chino buckles over and she hits him on the side of the head with her gun... 
ADELE (CONT'D) On your knees. 
He does as he's told.  Karen raises his jacket, feels around his waist from behind. 
ADELE (CONT'D) Lie face down on the floor. 
CHINO (hurting) What?! 
She kicks him over onto his stomach and stays there.  She puts her foot to his back as she reaches for the phone, dials.  She sees Adele staring at her. 
CHINO (CONT'D) (to Adele) Excuse me... 
Karen looks at Adele a moment, then says into the phone... 
KAREN Daniel Burdon, please.  Karen Sisco. 
CHINO Excuse me, Adele? 
ADELE Yes. 
CHINO You do the sawing of the box in half trick with you inside? 
ADELE (beat) Yes. 
CHINO Tell me, how do you do that? 
Adele looks at Karen, who shoves Chino's head to the floor with her foot. 
KAREN Shut up. 
BURDON (PHONE) Karen.  Where are you?  I been trying to get a hold of you. 
KAREN Daniel.  Listen -- 
BURDON (PHONE) Where are you?  I been trying to reach you. 
KAREN I'm at Adele Delisi's. 
BURDON (PHONE) What-- we already talked to her.  That's a dead end. 
KAREN (looking at Chino) Yeah, I know.  I was just leaving. Why were you trying to reach me? 
BURDON (PHONE) There was a Buddy Bragg at Lompoc around the same time Foley was there.  We got an address for him at the Adams Hotel in Hallandale.  I want you to go there, see if you can get the manager to i.d. him as the other guy.  If he does, you call me right away... 
KAREN All right, but... 
BURDON (PHONE) But don't you do anything.  You just have a seat, wait for me to get there. 
KAREN Sure, Daniel. 
BURDON (PHONE) Now.  What is it you wanted to tell me? 
KAREN Oh, I was just wondering, if I were to bring in Chirino, would you put me on the task force? 
BURDON (PHONE) (impatient) What?  Is that what you're calling me about? 
KAREN Yes or no, Daniel.  If I get him, will you let me go after Foley? 
BURDON (PHONE) Yeah, sure, Karen.  You bring in Chirino, you can be on the task force. 
KAREN That's all I wanted to know. 
BURDON (PHONE) Good.  Now forget about the ex-wife and get over to the Adams Hotel. 
Karen hangs up, looks at Adele.  Adele nods. 
ADELE You're good. 
KAREN Thank you. 
INT. BUDDY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
As Foley and Buddy quickly pack up their stuff. 
FOLEY First thing we do, we get to Detroit, we find Glenn, then we find a window to throw him out of. 
BUDDY I been thinkin', if I was Glenn, I was up there to take down the Ripper, where would I go? 
FOLEY Well, first off, if you were Glenn, you wouldn't be thinking. 
BUDDY Remember Snoopy Miller, his old pal from Lompoc? 
FOLEY Snoopy.  Christ, I thought he'd be brain dead by now. 
BUDDY He isn't fighting no more.  Glenn told me the Snoop's been managing some guys up there now, works out at the Kronk. 
INT. SHALAMAR APARTMENTS - LOBBY - NIGHT 
The ancient residents stop what they're doing as Burdon enters with eight guys in jackets and wool shirts hanging out, running shoes, half of them carrying what look like athletic bags. Karen meets them as they all walk to the elevator. 
BURDON You get the key? 
KAREN They're in 7D. 
She hands it to him as they wait for the elevator. 
BURDON I want two men outside, front and back. Conway and Jessup go on up to seven, cover both ends of the hall. 
Burdon, Karen and the remaining four SWAT team agents.  Burden looks at them one at a time. 
BURDON (CONT'D) You're primary, you're secondary, you're point man. 
KAREN You're gonna use a ram? 
BURDON Yeah, why? 
INT. TOWN CAR - SAME 
Kenneth and White Boy Bob nod along to some rap tape in the front seat.  Glenn sits in the back, looking pale, hugging himself, shaking.  Maurice looks out the window... 
MAURICE Was a time you see a gold Mercedes over in the parking lot has a license plate on it say HITMAN?  You know Tommy Hearns is inside.  Seeing the car would get our juices flowing. 
Maurice looks at Glenn now and grins. 
MAURICE (CONT'D) You already got your juices flowing, huh?  Pissed your pants back there at Eddie's house, didn't you? 
Glenn just looks at Maurice. 
MAURICE (CONT'D) That was some shit, huh? 
GLENN (indicates Kenneth) Why'd he have to do that to that girl? 
MAURICE Yeah, Kenneth, why you have to do that to that poor girl. 
KENNETH (smiles) Do what? 
Glenn says nothing, just looks at Kenneth. 
MAURICE Just wait till we get inside Ripley's house. 
And he and Whiteboy start laughing as they get out of the car. 
GLENN It's all right with you, I'll just hang in the car. 
MAURICE (beat) No.  You gonna stay close to me from now on.  So you don't disappear on me. 
GLENN Why would I do that? 
Maurice looks at him, starts laughing.  White Boy Bob and Kenneth join in.  Maurice leans over... Glenn flinches as Maurice opens Glenn's jacket so that we can see the BLOOD splattered on his T- shirt. 
MAURICE Was worse than you imagined, wasn't it? (then, smiles) Baby, you with the bad boys now. 
INT. FOLEY AND BUDDY'S CAR - SAME 
As they watch Glenn and Snoopy and White Boy Bob get out of the car. 
BUDDY Whatta you think? 
FOLEY I think Glenn opened his big mouth and now we got us another partner. 
BUDDY Or two. 
INT. BOXING GYM - DAY 
Glenn sits on a bench near the rear wall, facing the ring. Kenneth grabs a magazine, walks into the john.  A shirtless White Boy Bob lifts weights while Maurice moves around the ring calling to the boxers inside. 
MAURICE Stick and jab! 
VOICE Hey, Studs, how you doing? 
He looks up, sees Buddy and Foley coming this way. 
GLENN Jesus Christ, what're you guys doing here? 
They sit down on either side of him, close. 
FOLEY Weren't you expecting us? 
GLENN That broad you picked up -- did you know she was a US Marshal, for Christ sake? 
Now he turns to Buddy as Buddy stands up, takes off his overcoat and sits down again. 
GLENN (CONT'D) She knew me from some bullshit dope bust.  She drove me to court.  Twice. You know what she said, we're in the car on the turnpike?  "I never forget anybody I've cuffed and shackled." 
FOLEY Yeah?  She said that to you? 
Glenn turns to see Foley with a mild expression on his face, almost smiling. 
FOLEY (CONT'D) What happened to your shades?  Someone finally step on 'em? 
GLENN (touches his head) I don't know... 
Foley notices the blood on Glenn's shirt. 
FOLEY Whose blood you got all over you? 
GLENN These guys, man, they're crazy. (looks off) Shit. 
Foley follows his gaze, sees Maurice coming this way, White Boy Bob beside him, carrying his shirts. 
FOLEY Is that Snoopy?  In the purple doo rag? 
BUDDY What's he do now, tell fortunes? 
Maurice stands at the edge of the ring apron, looks from Foley to Buddy and back again, pretty serious about it. 
WHITE BOY BOB We have a problem here? 
MAURICE (walking over) Jack Foley, famous bank robber. 
FOLEY Snoopy Miller, famous fight thrower. 
MAURICE It seems to me I been reading about you in the newspaper.  Busted out of some joint in Florida, huh? 
FOLEY Low class of people there, Snoop. 
WHITE BOY BOB You call him that again I'll put your head through the wall. 
BUDDY What?  You mean Snoop? 
MAURICE Nobody calls me Snoop no more or Snoopy, is what White Boy's trying to say. He's a little crude, you understand. No, I left that Snoopy shit behind me. 
BUDDY But you call this bozo White Boy? 
GLENN White Boy Bob. (baiting) White Boy used to be a fighter. 
BUDDY What's he do now outside of shoot his mouth off? 
White Boy Bob stares down Buddy who couldn't give a shit. 
KAREN I'll need a last known address. 
CRUZ That's fine, but I don't want you to talk to Miller alone. 
KAREN Come on, Raymond, I'm a federal officer, I'm armed. 
He turns and looks at her. 
CRUZ Yes, you are.  I'll call you tomorrow with the address. 
As he gets into his car, we then: 
CUT TO: A NEWSPAPER 
The crime scene from the night before.  A shot of Karen and Ray Cruz as they exit the house.  A headline reads "TRIPLE MURDER" blah-blah-blah... 
BUDDY (PHONE) You have the paper? 
REVEAL: FOLEY'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY 
Foley, wearing a suit now, no shoes, no tie, looks at the newspaper photograph of Karen. 
FOLEY It's a terrific shot of her. 
INT. BUDDY'S ROOM - SAME 
Buddy looking at the same shot... 
BUDDY Outside of that. 
INTERCUTTING FOLEY & BUDDY 
FOLEY Doesn't say what she's doing up here, but I don't think it has anything to do with us. 
BUDDY She came up here on her vacation, 'cause she likes shitty weather. 
Foley reaches in one of the bags from the Jewish Recycling Center and pulls out a tie. 
FOLEY I think she's after Glenn.  The girl still with you? 
BUDDY They don't stay the night, Jack, 'less you pay for it. 
FOLEY You tell your sister about it? 
BUDDY Just hung up. 
FOLEY How long you talk to her? 
BUDDY Two hours. 
FOLEY How long were you with the girl? 
BUDDY Forty-five minutes. 
FOLEY You didn't tell your sister about Ripley, did you?  'Cause I don't wanna go through that again. 
BUDDY Forget about my sister.  If Karen Sisco's tailing Glenn, we're fucked. Tomorrow night at the fights we all get picked up. 
FOLEY Let's drive by where we're meeting and have a look.  Maybe take a look at Ripley's place while we're at it. 
Foley hangs up.  He faces the mirror, starts to tie his tie. 
RIPLEY (V.O.) I guess next time I see you, you'll be wearing a suit and tie... 
INT. RIPLEY'S CELL - DAY 
Foley leans in the doorway watching as Ripley, dressed in a jogging suit, and under the watchful eye of A GUARD, gathers up his belongings.  He's going home. 
FOLEY I still haven't made up my mind yet. 
RIPLEY What's to think about? 
FOLEY You goin' right back to work? 
RIPLEY First, I'm goin' to Israel for a year, study the Talmud, work on a Kibbutz... then come back, maybe take some tennis lessons. 
He tears a picture off the wall... 
RIPLEY (CONT'D) Here... (hands it to Foley) Something to remember me by. 
Foley stares at the photograph of sea life. 
RIPLEY (CONT'D) It's not the real thing, but it's still nice to look at. 
Foley looks at Ripley, who extends his hand. 
RIPLEY (CONT'D) See you on the outside, Jack. 
INT. FOLEY'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY 
Foley finishes tying his tie, stares into the mirror, takes in the overall effect. 
FOLEY (smiles) Hi!  I just broke outta jail! 
His smile fades, he then sits down heavily on the bed, looks at the picture of Karen another moment, then sets the paper aside, grabs the Yellow Pages, flips to HOTELS, and dials the phone... 
VOICE (PHONE) Atheneum Hotel. 
FOLEY Karen Sisco, please. 
VOICE (pause, then) I'm sorry, but there's no one by that name registered. 
FOLEY Thank you. 
He dials the next number... 
VOICE Best Western... 
EXT. MAURICE "SNOOPY" MILLER'S HOUSE - DAY 
Red brick, showing its age.  Karen rings the doorbell and then waits with her hands shoved into the pockets of her dark, navy coat.  The door opens to reveal Moselle in her green silk robe holding her arms close against the cold. 
KAREN Moselle Miller? 
Her hand goes into her bag next to the chair. 
KENNETH Bring your own rubbers with you? 
Her hand comes out of the bag holding what looks like the grip on a golf club.  Kenneth grins at her... 
KENNETHN (CONT'D) What else you have in there, mace? Have a whistle, different kinds of female-protection shit? 
Karen pushes out of the chair to stand with him face-to-face. 
KAREN I have to go, Kenneth. 
She gives him a friendly poke with the black vinyl baton that's like a golf club grip. 
KAREN (CONT'D) Maybe we'll see each other again, okay? 
She steps aside and brushes past him.  He grabs her left wrist... 
KENNETH We gonna tussle first. 
Karen flicks the baton and sixteen inches of chrome steel shoots out of the grip.  She pulls an arm's length away from him and chops the rigid shaft at his head, Kenneth hunching, ducking away... 
KENNETH (CONT'D) God damn... 
He lets go of her and Karen gets the room she needs, so that when he comes at her, she whips the shaft across the side of his head and he howls, stops dead, presses a hand over his ear. 
KENNETH (CONT'D) What's wrong with you? 
KAREN You wanted to tussle, we tussled. 
And she walks out.  She sees Moselle standing there in the foyer. Karen looks at her a moment, puts the baton in her purse and comes out with a business card. 
KAREN (CONT'D) I wrote my hotel number on there -- in case you run into Glenn. 
Moselle slips the card into the pocket of her robe.  Karen smiles at her and walks out the door. 
EXT. RICHARD RIPLEY'S HOUSE - DAY 
It's snowing pretty hard when Foley and Buddy pull up out front. 
INT. BUDDY'S CAR - SAME 
Buddy wipes the condensation off his window, so they can see the house. 
BUDDY Now that's a really big house. 
FOLEY Jesus, look at that wall.  Place almost looks like a prison. 
BUDDY No doubt the man's got some big-ass security system. 
FOLEY Time comes, we knock on the door.  See if he wants to talk about old times. Go in the easy way. 
BUDDY Yeah?  You think he'll let us in, we got Snoopy and the muscle-bound asshole with us? 
FOLEY Who says anybody's gonna be with us? I say we go to the fights tomorrow, find out what the Snoop's big plan is, then go in ahead of those guys -- alone. 
BUDDY Let Glenn deal with the Snoop, while we're off livin' the good life. 
FOLEY Tell me something, Buddy.  You know anyone who's actually done one last big score and gone to live the good life?  Cause it occurred to me that everyone talks about doing it, but I don't know anyone who's actually gone and done it.  Do you? 
BUDDY (beat) What about that D.B. Cooper guy? 
Foley looks at him. 
BUDDY (CONT'D) I mean, they don't know for sure he's dead. (then) Look, there's always a chance we'll walk out've there with nothing.  I say let fate decide. 
FOLEY Let fate decide?  What're you, the fuckin' Dali Lama now? 
BUDDY My sister believes in fate, but not hell.  That's why she stopped praying for the lost souls since you don't hear that much about purgatory anymore. But every day she asks her boss to pray I don't fuck up.  Whatta you think, you think there's a hell, Jack? 
FOLEY Yeah, it's called Glades Correctional Institution and I'm sure as shit not going back there or any place like it. 
BUDDY You might not have a choice. 
Foley looks at him. 
BUDDY (CONT'D) They put a gun on you, you'll go back. 
FOLEY They put a gun on you, you still have a choice, don't you? 
Foley turns back to the house.  And now we hear... 
MR. HEARN (VO) I think you're gonna fit right in... 
INT. RIPLEY ENTERPRISES PERSONNEL OFFICE - DAY 
The personnel guy, MR. HEARN, sits behind his desk, squeezing a grip exerciser and smiling warmly at Foley, who wears a shitty suit and tie. 
MR. HEARN Now Mr Ripley and I have had a long discussion about your role in the company and it was his feeling that you would be happiest working down here in Miami.  How's that sound to you? 
FOLEY Great. 
Mr. Hearn pauses, looks down at Foley... 
MR. HEARN You're about a 42 long, right? 
FOLEY What? 
But Mr. Hearn walks out without answering.  Foley looks at the desktop, where a spoon sticks out of a half-eaten fruit-on-the- bottom yogurt, which in turn sits beside a half-eaten Powerbar. 
Foley shakes his head, takes out his zippo, starts to play with it. 
MR. HEARN Okay.  Let's see how she fits. 
Foley turns as Mr. Hearn bounces back into the room with what looks like a UNIFORM draped over one arm. 
FOLEY What is this? 
MR. HEARN Your uniform. 
FOLEY My what? 
Mr. Hearn shows him the yellow patch that reads SECURITY on one arm.  Foley smiles... amused... angry... hurt... 
CUT TO: KAREN 
Eyes open, serious now. 
REVEAL 
She's lying in Jack's arms.  She looks at him a moment, then moves away from him to sit up and swing her legs off the bed. 
FOLEY You coming back? 
KAREN I'm just going to the bathroom. 
She gets up and crosses the room to the bathroom and closes the door.  Foley picks up his Zippo off the night table. 
INT. BATHROOM - SAME 
She comes in.  Looks at herself in the mirror.  Suddenly feels self-conscious.  She grabs a bathrobe off the door. 
INT. BEDROOM - SAME 
Foley lies there, fiddling with the Zippo, staring up at the ceiling.  She comes out again and stands looking down at him. 
KAREN I want you to know something.  I wasn't looking for just a fuck, if that's what you're thinking. 
FOLEY Why are you mad? 
KAREN Or I did it for some kind of kinky thrill.  Score with a bank robber the way some women go for rough trade. 
FOLEY What about my motive?  Now I can say I fucked a US Marshal.  You think I will? 
KAREN I don't know. 
He raises the covers, but she just stands there. 
FOLEY I know of a guy he goes in the bank holding a bottle he says is nitroglycerin.  He scores some cash off a teller, he's on his way out when he drops the bottle.  It shatters on the tile floor, he slips in the stuff, cracks his head and they've got him. The nitro was canola oil.  I know more fucked-up bank robbers than ones that know what they're doing.  I doubt one in ten can tell a dye pack when he sees one.  Most bank robbers are fucking morons.  To go to bed with a bank robber for kinky thrills, as you say, you'd have to be as dumb as they are.  I know you're not dumb, so why would I think that?  Why would you think I might think that? 
She comes over and sits down on the bed. 
KAREN You're not dumb. 
FOLEY I don't know about that.  You can't do three falls and think you have much of a brain. 
They lie there for a few moments, Karen watching him.  He senses this, looks at her... 
FOLEY (CONT'D) You getting serious on me now? 
KAREN I'm trying not to.  I just wanna know what's gonna happen. 
FOLEY (beat) You know. 
And he kisses her. 
EXT. DETROIT - DAY 
The sun is out.  The snow has stopped falling.  A white blanket covers everything. 
INT. KAREN'S HOTEL ROOM - SAME 
Karen opens her eyes, wakes up.  She closes them again, lies on her side, but doesn't move for a moment.  Then... 
KAREN Oh, for Christ sake, grow up. 
She opens her eyes and rolls on to her back.  She turns her head: Foley's gone.  She gets out of bed. 
INT. SITTING ROOM - SAME 
Karen comes into the room tying her robe.  She looks at the coffee table where... 
Something wrapped in a napkin lies by the half-empty bottle and the ice bucket.  She picks it up and slowly unfolds the "gift" from Foley:  Her Sig-Sauer .38. 
INT. FOLEY'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY 
Buddy stands at the window looking out as Foley -- in his underwear -- sits at the table reading the newspaper, a room- service breakfast, a bottle of Jim Beam close by. 
BUDDY It took you, what, seven hours to buy a pair of shoes? 
FOLEY I saw Karen Sisco. 
Buddy turns to him. 
BUDDY And she saw you? 
FOLEY Yes, she did. 
BUDDY So how's that work, a wanted felon socializing with a U.S. Marshal? 
FOLEY You know how I felt about her. 
BUDDY Did you give her a jump?  If you did I might begin to understand where your head's at. 
FOLEY It wasn't about getting laid.  I just wanted to know what might've happened if things were different. 
BUDDY You find out? 
FOLEY Yeah, I did. 
Buddy watches Foley pour a shot of Jim Beam in his coffee. 
BUDDY So what's that mean?  That you're disappointed by what you found or you're sorry you robbed all those banks? 
FOLEY I don't know. 
INT. KAREN'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY 
Karen sits there staring at a Wild Turkey bottle, a couple of glasses.  She reaches for the phone, dials.  A moment later, we hear MARSHALL SISCO'S ANSWERING MACHINE and she hangs up. 
INT. STATE THEATER - NIGHT 
A ring set up on stage.  Men hang out on the side.  Where movie seats used to be are rows of round nightclub tables; a row of them on each of four levels rising a step at a time up through the theatre to the bar.  Rap music booms out of speakers as fighters are announced. 
Everyone in here is black except for Glenn and White Boy Bob who sit at a table in the front row while Maurice in a dude black felt cap set on his head just right and shades walks along the apron of the stage. 
MAURICE Stick and jab, stick and jab! 
MAURICE (CONT'D) Kenneth, this is Mr. Jack Foley and this is Mr. Buddy, famous bank robbers. 
Foley nods to the raincoat draped over the back of a chair. 
FOLEY Who's sitting here? 
MAURICE Your homie, Glenn.  Only thing, he went to the men's about a while ago and never came back. 
Foley gives Buddy a look.  White Boy Bob grins at them. 
WHITE BOY BOB I think he must've fell in. 
MAURICE I sent these two looking for him, they come back shaking their heads. 
FOLEY Well, if he left his coat and he's been gone a while. 
WHITE BOY BOB The car's still there.  I looked. 
MAURICE (to the ring) Reggie, push off and hit, man.  Push him off. 
FOLEY We're leaving. 
MAURICE The fuck you talking about? 
FOLEY Snoop, if you don't know where Glenn is... 
Maurice takes Foley by the arm, moves him away from the table. 
MAURICE Look, what you worried about Glenn for?  What's he know? 
FOLEY I thought everything. 
Foley watches the fighters: one of them patient, moving in while the other one takes wild swings and misses... 
MAURICE Glenn knows everything we suppose to do tomorrow.  Glenn could tell somebody that, yeah, but it don't mean shit. You understand?  'Cause Glenn don't know I changed the plan. (then) It's happening tonight. 
Foley looks at Maurice now. 
MAURICE (CONT'D) Soon as we leave here.  Stop home and pick up what we need and go do it. 
FOLEY (beat) Give me a minute, talk to Buddy. 
MAURICE You got two minutes, that's all.  Make up your mind. 
FOLEY I wasn't asking permission. 
Foley walks up to the bar with Buddy. 
FOLEY (CONT'D) They want to go tonight, before Glenn gets in any trouble, opens his big mouth. 
BUDDY Whatta you wanna do? 
Foley takes out his lighter, begins playing with it. 
BUDDY (CONT'D) You know they gonna set us up. 
FOLEY I get that feeling, yeah. 
BUDDY But you still think you can get the diamonds fore they do? 
Foley looks at him a moment, then... 
FOLEY I'll make you a deal.  Get out of here. Right now.  I'll do the job with the Snoop, meet you wherever you want and give you half. 
BUDDY Half for doing what? 
FOLEY Getting me out of Glades for starters. 
BUDDY And who watches your back? 
ON MAURICE 
As he sits down with White Boy Bob and Kenneth, watches as Buddy and Foley talk up at the bar. 
MAURICE Man has all that reward on his head and still talks like a con in the yard. You know what I'm saying?  Like he's a man you don't mess with.  Yeah, well, what I say to Jack Foley is buuullshit. 
EXT. MAURICE'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
It's snowing as Maurice, White Boy Bob, Kenneth, Buddy, and Foley pile into the back of a van, the name of some plumbing and heating company on the side. 
We PULL BACK TO REVEAL that we're watching from inside Karen's car.  She waits for the van to pull away, then follows. 
INT. VAN - NIGHT 
Kenneth -- the fucking maniac -- at the wheel.  Buddy and Foley piled into the back of the van full of plastic pipe and equipment.  Maurice pulls on a pair of white coveralls. 
FOLEY That what they're wearing these days to break and enter? 
MAURICE Break and enter, shit.  Take it and git, how it's done.  Don't waste any time.  That's how you do it. 
FOLEY So you've done this before, huh? 
MAURICE Shit, yeah.  White Boy even got busted for it. (then) White Boy, tell these boys the reason you went down on that burglary that time. 
WHITE BOY BOB I left my wallet in the house I robbed. 
The guy grins at them.  Foley can't believe it. 
MAURICE Takes the TV, the VCR, some other shit and leaves his wallet on the floor. 
FOLEY That's a wonderful story, Snoop.  I'm very excited about tonight. 
MAURICE Hey.  You learn from doing. 
Foley and Buddy exchange looks.  Maurice turns around, a Beretta in his hand.  Foley looks at him.  Buddy tenses. 
MAURICE (CONT'D) You know how to use one a these? 
FOLEY I've seen 'em used on TV. 
Maurice hands Foley the Beretta.  Then reaches into a bag, comes up with a .38 he hands to Buddy. 
INT. KAREN'S CAR - SAME 
MAURICE First money, then pussy. 
Alone with Buddy now, Foley rolls his mask up on his head. 
FOLEY You ever wear one of these? 
BUDDY I don't ski. 
FOLEY Stay with the maid.  I'm gonna have a look around. 
INT. KAREN'S CAR - NIGHT 
Karen on the phone... snow falling all around her. 
RAYMOND CRUZ (PHONE) I'll send a unit over there, see if there's anything going on. 
KAREN Tell me where Ripley's house is.  I'll meet them there. 
CRUZ (PHONE) Karen, you gonna promise me you're not gonna go in, do anything stupid till I get there... 
INT. BEDROOM - SAME TIME 
Full of fat, cushy chairs and a sofa, everything white or black, a wet bar, a big TV, CD player.  Buddy moves into the doorway, peers inside. 
Kenneth is trying to find a radio station while Maurice and White Boy Bob ransack the place.  White Boy Bob checks under the mattress... 
WHITE BOY BOB Hey-- 
Maurice and Kenneth look over expectantly. 
WHITE BOY BOB (CONT'D) I found a rubber. 
MAURICE White Boy, the man's not gonna hide no diamonds under the fuckin' mattress. 
Maurice looks out the door, sees Buddy in the doorway. 
MAURICE (CONT'D) Where's Foley? 
BUDDY Checkin' the other rooms, like you said. 
MAURICE (to White Boy) Go keep an eye on him. 
White Boy Bob slips out of the room.  Maurice turns to Kenneth, who's still playing with the stereo. 
MAURICE (CONT'D) Kenneth, fuck the radio, put on a CD. 
KENNETH (looking them over) I don't recognize none of these bands. 
MAURICE Just pick one, put it on. 
INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME 
White Boy Bob watches from the end of the hall as Foley peers into each of the bedrooms.  Foley sees a back staircase and starts down.  A moment later White Boy Bob follows. 
INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME 
White Boy Bob comes down the stairs.  No sign of Foley.  White Boy starts down one hallway, then turns back.  Now he's lost. He opens a door, starts to walk into a closet, then backs out. He goes down the hall, turns into... 
THE KITCHEN - SAME 
Where White Boy Bob enters, calls out tentatively. 
WHITE BOY BOB Uh, Foley? 
He takes in the huge room, the massive sub-zero refrigerator. He moves to the freezer, opens it, takes in the FROZEN STEAKS. 
WHITE BOY BOB (CONT'D) Cool. 
INT. HALLWAY (DOWNSTAIRS) - SAME 
As Foley quietly moves to the doorway, peers into the kitchen, watches White Boy Bob starts going through the freezer, taking out steaks and stacking them up on the counter.  Foley shakes his head and moves on. 
INT. LIBRARY (DOWNSTAIRS) - SAME 
Dark.  As Foley steps into the doorway, we BOOM DOWN to reveal a LIGHTED AQUARIUM in f.g.  He comes into the room, sits down in an armchair beside the fish tank. 
He leans close to the glass, stares at the fish a moment.  He sees a door reflected there and turns to look across the room, sees how the phone cord disappears underneath. 
FOLEY They cut the lines, Richard. 
Silence.  The door opens and we see a terrified Richard Ripley sitting on top of a toilet, the phone in his lap. 
RIPLEY Foley?  That you? 
FOLEY How are you, Richard? 
RIPLEY Jesus Christ, what the hell are you doing here?  What's going on?  Who's upstairs? 
FOLEY Maurice Miller, couple of his friends. 
RIPLEY Maurice?  From Lompoc?  Good God. 
Ripley moves to the doorway. 
RIPLEY (CONT'D) Have they got Midge up there? 
FOLEY What kinda man lets a woman answer the door, this time a night? 
RIPLEY We thought it might be her husband. Sometimes he comes and checks up on her.  She told him I was down in Florida. 
FOLEY A minute or two, you're gonna wish you were. 
Ripley looks at him.  Foley pats the back of a chair. 
FOLEY (CONT'D) Why don't you come on over here, sit down, Richard, have a look at your fish. 
EXT. BLOOMFIELD HILLS - ROAD - SAME 
As Karen slowly negotiates her way through the snowstorm. 
INT. RIPLEY'S BEDROOM - SAME 
The music ON LOUD (Herb Alpert -- Tijuana Taxi).  Buddy stands in the doorway, watches Maurice, out of his coveralls, as he takes suits and sport coats from the walk-in closet to look them over.  He tries on a coat, turns to the maid. 
BUDDY They look like plain old rocks. 
FOLEY They sure do. 
He gets up, looks at Buddy. 
FOLEY (CONT'D) Go get a bag. 
Foley turns to Richard as Buddy comes back into the room with a plastic bag, starts reaching into the tank. 
FOLEY (CONT'D) I were you, I'd get up and run. 
RIPLEY I'm not leaving Midge. 
FOLEY Don't be an asshole, Richard.  They're gonna kill you. 
RIPLEY If that's my fate, so be it.  I'm not leaving. (then) I love her, Jack. 
Foley looks at Buddy.  Now what? 
BUDDY C'mon. 
Foley just looks at Ripley, who doesn't move. 
FOLEY Good luck, Richard. 
MAURICE (OS) Someone down here? 
Buddy and Foley slip out the other door, down the hall, just as Maurice walks in, some of Ripley's clothes over his arm. 
MAURICE (CONT'D) Well, if it isn't the Ripper hisself. 
RIPLEY Are those my suits? 
MAURICE Where you been hiding, Dick? 
EXT. HOUSE - SAME 
A now-freezing Karen hugs a retaining wall, watches as Foley and Buddy emerge from the house. 
AT THE VAN 
As Buddy leans under the dash.  Foley looks up at the house where we see shadows moving about in the upstairs window, hear the faint pumping of the music.  We hear the VAN START. 
BUDDY Okay. 
Buddy straightens up, looks at Foley. 
BUDDY (CONT'D) Come on. 
FOLEY Shit. 
BUDDY What? 
FOLEY They're gonna rape the maid, aren't they. 
BUDDY From the looks of those boys, the Ripper too. 
FOLEY And then they'll kill 'em. 
BUDDY At least. 
Foley looks at the diamonds in the bag. 
FOLEY We made it, didn't we? 
BUDDY All you gotta do is get in. 
Again Foley looks at the diamonds, then... 
FOLEY I'm going back inside. 
BUDDY I'll go with you. 
Foley finally hands him the bag with the diamonds in it... 
FOLEY No, you dump the van, meet me at the airport. I'll take one of Ripley's cars. 
BUDDY Jack -- 
FOLEY Listen, Buddy, the shit that's about to go down, you'll be on the phone with your sister for a month.  Let me do this part alone. 
Buddy just looks at him. 
FOLEY (CONT'D) I'm saying this isn't your problem. Far as I'm concerned, we're square. 
Foley turns to go. 
BUDDY Hey... 
Buddy hands him his gun.  Foley takes it, stuffs it in the back of his pants, and then turns back to the house. 
FOLEY Now get outta here. 
KAREN 
As she watches Foley go back inside.  A moment later, the van pulls out of the driveway.  Karen makes a decision, starts for the side of the house... 
INT. RIPLEY'S HOUSE - THE FOYER - SAME 
Foley enters and we hear the maid scream.  Foley starts up the stairs. 
INT. RIPLEY'S STUDY 
Maurice and White Boy Bob both have their guns to Ripley's head. 
RIPLEY (hears the scream) Midge. 
MAURICE Forget about her.  Tell me where the money's at. 
RIPLEY Foley's got it. 
MAURICE Where the fuck is Foley? 
INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME 
As Foley finally shoves Maurice down the stairs.  Maurice rolls down a few steps, right over White Boy Bob, as... 
Foley gets up, runs back to the bedroom. 
INT. RIPLEY'S BEDROOM - SAME 
As Foley enters, goes straight to Kenneth's body, begins searching for the shotgun (lifting the covers, turning over the body, etc) with no success... 
FOLEY Shit... 
INT. STAIRWELL - SAME 
As Maurice attempts to prise the gun out from under the dead bulk of White Boy Bob. 
INT. RIPLEY'S BEDROOM - SAME 
As Foley, exasperated, stands back up... 
MIDGE (O.S.) This what you want? 
Foley looks to where Midge stands -- now back in her bathrobe, but more importantly, clutching the shotgun.  Foley crosses and takes it from her, begins to stride out of the room, when -- 
MIDGE (CONT'D) It's empty. 
Foley just looks at her. 
INT. STAIRWELL - SAME 
As Maurice finally rolls White Boy Bob over, grabs the gun... 
INT. RIPLEY'S BEDROOM - SAME 
As Foley sticks his hand in Kenneth's coveralls, comes out with a shell, loads the gun, snaps it shut... 
INT. STAIRWELL - SAME 
As Maurice cocks the pistol, takes a step up the stairs... 
KAREN (OS) Maurice-- 
Maurice spins around, points his gun down at Karen, now standing in the foyer, her own gun pointing up at him... 
EXT. HOUSE - SAME TIME 
As Raymond Cruz and several green-and-whites arrive... 
INT. RIPLEY'S BEDROOM - SAME 
As Jack, about to exit, stops cold as he HEARS TWO GUNSHOTS, then a BODY FALL. 
He stands still.  Not sure who was just shot.  After a long moment, we then hear: 
KAREN (OS) Jack? 
He sees Midge looking at him, closes his eyes, sags against the wall. 
KAREN (OS) (CONT'D) I know you're up there. 
INT. FOYER - SAME 
As Foley steps into the hallway, his ski mask now pulled down over his face.  He holds Kenneth's shotgun in one hand and his pistol in another. 
KAREN Come on, Jack -- don't. 
FOLEY Pretend I'm somebody else. 
KAREN You think I'd shoot you? 
Foley brings up the pistol and the shotgun.  AND NOW WE HEAR THE SIRENS... 
FOLEY If you don't, one of those guys will. 
KAREN What're you now, a desperado?  Put the guns down. 
FOLEY I told you, I'm not going back. 
He raises the guns hip-high and we hear sounds behind Karen, but she's quick to raise her hand, though she doesn't turn or look around. 
KAREN Don't do this.  Please. 
They stand there staring at each other. 
FOLEY No more time outs. 
He raises the guns.  She sadly shakes her head. 
KAREN You win, Jack. 
She fires and he falls to the staircase, dropping the guns, grabbing hold of his right thigh.  And now Cruz and several other cops enter... Karen motions them to stop... 
CRUZ Karen, I told you not to-- 
KAREN Wait, I know him --okay? 
She goes up the staircase to where Foley is lying and gently lifts the ski mask and looks at his sad eyes. 
KAREN (CONT'D) I'm sorry, Jack, but I can't shoot you. 
FOLEY You just did, for Christ sake. 
KAREN You know what I mean. 
She glances about, makes sure no one can hear, then leans closer to him. 
KAREN (CONT'D) I wish things were different.  I'm sorry, Jack. 
Foley looks like he's in pain.  He watches as she walks back down the stairs.  As a couple of uniform cops rush past her and pick up Foley, a shaky Ripley staggers into the foyer. 
MIDGE Richard! 
She comes running down the stairs into his arms.  They embrace. He looks at Foley over her shoulder...

A school bus.  TWO very buxom PROSTITUTES are being handcuffed by a plain clothes special agent, CHESTER DESMOND.  Another AGENT has his gun to the spread eagled BUS DRIVER's head.  The KIDS inside the bus are screaming.  The phone inside Chester Desmond's car starts to ring.  Desmond walks to the car.

DESMOND (little louder) OK, Gordon. 
COLE OREGON.  A YOUNG GIRL HAS BEEN MURDERED.  SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD. NAMED TERESA BANKS. 
DESMOND (very loud) Okay, Gordon!!! 
Desmond electronically lowers the aerial adjusting the volume. 
COLE GOT A MAP OF THE ENVIRONS OF THE YAKIMA INDIAN RESERVATION WITH YOUR NAME ON IT.  BETTER BRING A POLE. 
DESMOND Smell something fishy, huh?

Desmond enters.  Cole and another man, SAM STANLEY, walk towards him. 
COLE (motioning to the man standing there) CHET, GIVE SAM STANLEY THE GLAD HAND.  HE'S COME OVER FROM SPOKANE. 
Desmond and Stanley shake. 
STANLEY It's a pleasure.  I've heard a lot about you. 
COLE SAM'S THE MAN WHO CRACKED THE WHITEMAN CASE. 
DESMOND Congratulations.  I heard about that. 
COLE (plowing ahead) YOUR SURPRISE, CHET.  HER NAME IS LIL. 
LIL walks to them from another room.  She goes into a contorted dance. 
Stanley rides along quietly for a while. 
STANLEY What did Gordon's tie mean? 
DESMOND What?  That's just Gordon's bad taste. 
STANLEY Why couldn't he have just told you all these things? 
DESMOND He talks loud.  And he loves his code. 
STANLEY I see.  He does talk loud. 
DESMOND Gordon would not have sent us to Deer Meadow without thinking it was a high priority situation. 
STANLEY It must be a high priority situation. 
12.     EXT.  HIGHWAY - SAME 
Desmond's car drives off. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
13.     EXT.  DEER MEADOW SHERIFF'S STATION - AFTERNOON 
Desmond and Stanley arrive.  The Sheriff's Station is in a sorry state outside...  They walk up to the old steps and enter. 
14.     INT.  DEER MEADOW SHERIFF'S STATION, RECEPTION AREA - DAY 
Agent Desmond and Stanley walk into a very small reception area.  At the counter Desmond shows his badge to CLIFF HOWARD, the Deputy. 
DESMOND Good afternoon, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent Chet Desmond.  I'd like to see Sheriff Cable. 
Cliff just smiles for a long minute. 
CLIFF Why don't you folks have a seat.  Make yourself at home.  It's gonna be a while. 
Desmond stays standing and Stanley sits.  After another long moment, Cliff joins the SECRETARY in a conspiratorial giggle over the long wait they are planning to give the FBI.  In the middle of a giggle Cliff smiles up at Desmond. 
CLIFF (continued) Why don't you have some of that coffee. It was fresh two days ago. 
Cliff has a good laugh over this and leans again over the secretary pretending to look at some paper work.  They both laugh. 
DESMOND Okay, that's it.  I've had enough of the waiting room now. 
CLIFF (still smiling) Oh. 
Desmond walks towards the door that obviously must go to Sheriff Cable's office. 
Cliff blocks his way with his arm across the doorway, daring him to do something.  While they stare eye to eye, Desmond's hand goes up slowly towards Cliff's face in a slow mesmerizing way.  Cliff tries to knock Chet's hand away.  Chet counters by grabbing Cliff's nose and pinches a nerve to its side injecting Cliff with a great amount of pain. 
CLIFF (continued) AAAHHHHHHHH... 
Desmond spins the deputy 180 degrees placing himself on the inside of the office and then still pressing the nerve guides Cliff down into a chair. 
While the Deputy's eyes tear copiously Desmond turns to the secretary. 
DESMOND You can start that FRESH pot of coffee right now. 
Desmond stalks to Sheriff Cable's office.  Stanley remains behind continuing to observe every detail. 
15.     INT.  SHERIFF CABLE'S OFFICE - DAY 
SHERIFF CABLE looks up from his work. 
CABLE How the hell did you... 
Desmond shows his credentials. 
DESMOND Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent Chet Desmond. 
Cliff, still holding his nose, appears just behind Desmond, who turns to him. 
DESMOND (continued) That's all right, Deputy, Sheriff Cable can take it from here 
Cable signals Cliff to leave. 
DESMOND (continued) I'm here to investigate the murder of Teresa Banks. 
CABLE Well, little fella, we don't need any outside help here.  I don't like you people sniffin' around my neck of the woods.  In fact, when the state boys called me about a "J. Edgar" coming up I think I said, "So what?" 
DESMOND Your behavior is not funny and is wasting the time of the Federal Government. 
CABLE You're lucky I am not wasting you. 
DESMOND Well, little fella, let me put it this way. The operative word here would be "Federal".  With or without the semantics of all this, I am now ordering you to release all pertinent information concerning Teresa Banks, both while living and deceased. 
Cable retrieves a box with the paper work and some personal effects. He throws it to Desmond. 
CABLE A basic kill.  Banks was a drifter and nobody knew her.  My boys have been all over this.  It's a dead end. 
DESMOND That's why we're here, Sheriff Cable. Where's the body? 
CABLE Out back in our morgue 
Desmond starts to leave. 
CABLE (continued) It's 4:30.  We close at five. 
DESMOND We've got our own clock.  We'll lock up. 
As Desmond turns to leave he notices on the wall a framed Newspaper clipping with picture. 
The caption reads: 
"CABLE BENDS STEEL" 
DESMOND We're not.  You and I are going to get some food. 
STANLEY Yes, it's been several hours since we've eaten.  I didn't realize that so much time had past, did you, Agent Desmond? 
Desmond takes a long look at Stanley. 
STANLEY (continued) You've got your own M.O., don't you, Agent Desmond? 
Desmond gets in and starts the car. 
19.     EXT.  HAP'S DINER - LATE NIGHT 
Establish. 
20.     INT.  HAP'S DINER, MANAGER'S OFFICE - LATE NIGHT 
Desmond and Stanley talk with JACK, the manager who has black wavy hair with a black full mustache to match, shiny silk shirt with silver strands sown in and an Indian turquoise belt.  He has a sign on his shirt that says, "Say 'Goodbye' to JACK". 
A GUY in the room is working on a light that keeps buzzing and shorting out.  He doesn't really know what he's doing so he is poking at the wiring. 
JACK Had the FBI here once before.  Back in the fifties when Hap was running the place. 
DESMOND Where's Hap? 
JACK He's dead - good and dead. 
DESMOND Sorry to hear it. 
JACK He didn't suffer. 
DESMOND I'd like to ask you a few questions about Teresa Banks 
JACK Sheriff Cable's already asked me a few questions about Teresa Banks.  She worked nights for a month.  That's it. 
DESMOND Any friends? 
JACK No. 
DESMOND Ever see her with someone else? 
JACK No. 
DESMOND Did she ever mention any friends? 
JACK No. (pointing) Ask Irene over there. 
He gestures thru a door that leads out to the diner, pointing out a woman behind the counter. 
JACK (continued) Now, her name _is_ Irene and it _is_ night. Don't take it any further than that. There's nothin' good about it. 
21.     INT.  HAP'S DINER - SAME 
They sit at the counter and IRENE comes over to them.  Behind her is the coffee and she is working on a cigarette.  Lipstick smeared on the coffee cup. 
IRENE Take a good look around.  There's nobody in this place - you're meetin' the reason why.  What'll it be? 
DESMOND How come Jack let's you work here? 
IRENE Jack and I are united in holy matrimony. 
DESMOND Say no more. 
Stanley is casing the restaurant as Irene pours them a couple of cups of coffee. 
DESMOND (showing credentials) Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent Chet Desmond.  I'd like to ask you a few questions about Teresa Banks. Jack said you knew her.  How well? 
IRENE She only worked here a month.  Nice girl.  Never seemed to get here on time though.  Ask me she had a little problem with -- 
She makes a sniff to indicate a "cocaine problem". 
IRENE (continued) Came looking for a job with a friend of hers.  Pretty girl.  Could've been her sister. 
DESMOND What happened to her? 
IRENE There was only one job.  Teresa took the job.  Her friend took a hike.  Never saw her again. 
DESMOND Did you ever see Teresa take cocaine? 
IRENE No. 
DESMOND Do you take cocaine, Irene? 
IRENE No, I do not.  I never took cocaine or any other drugs.  I don't take drugs. 
STANLEY Nicotine is a drug.  Caffeine is a drug. 
IRENE Who's Shorty?  Those drugs are legal. 
DESMOND He's with me. (back on the track) Anything you would like to tell us about Teresa Banks that would help us out? 
IRENE I've thought about that.  I think her death is what you would call a "freak accident". 
DESMOND Thanks. 
An OLD GUY, long and skinny, smoking, gets Desmond's attention. 
OLD GUY You talking about that little girl that was murdered? 
DESMOND You have something to tell us? 
OLD GUY Yeah. 
DESMOND What? 
OLD GUY I can tell shit from shinolah.  Gets me along way down that road. 
34.     INT. GORDON COLE'S OFFICE, PHILADELPHIA - DAY 
Cole and ALBERT ROSENFIELD talk. 
COLE EVERY SYLLABLE OF EVERY WORD IS THE SOUND OF TWO HANDS CLAPPING.  IS THAT WHAT YOU SAID, ALBERT? 
ALBERT Six to eight hands clapping.  I was referring to the possibility of a little silence. 
The phone rings and Cole answers it. 
35.     INT.  PHILADELPHIA FBI OFFICES 
AGENT DALE COOPER, in the doorway across the hall, talks to DIANE in the next room.  While he talks he does some isometrics against the door frame. 
COOPER I know you haven't changed your hair and I've seen that beautiful dress before, but I must say, Diane, you look sensational today. 
Diane says something else that we cannot hear. 
COOPER (enjoying this) No, I am not trying to buy time.  It's Thursday and I know you have changed something in the room...  and this time you've done very well... (stalling) And I am going to tell you exactly what it is...  in a moment...  you have moved... (snaps his fingers) Got it!  It's the clock, you've moved it 12 inches to the left. (a laugh) Another triumph for the dashing Agent Cooper.  And you, Diane, now have to clean the coffee cup, get fresh ground coffee from Sally and make a damn great pot of coffee. 
Cooper with a triumphant smile walks over to join Cole and Albert. But Cole's stern look takes his smile away. 
COOPER What is it, Gordon? 
COLE COOP, AGENT CHET DESMOND HAS DISAPPEARED.  GONE LIKE THE WIND IN DEER MEADOW. 
36.     INT.  SAM STANLEY'S APARTMENT, SPOKANE - DAY 
All around the walls of Stanley's apartment are work benches with adding machinery sitting on top of them.  In the middle of the room is a portable plastic pool, with milky white water and crystallized salt formations clinging to the sides like quartz rocks.  From one odd looking piece of machinery there are wires which extend into the pool. 
Cooper's eyes go to the pool and back to Stanley as Sam talks about Desmond. 
STANLEY Agent Chet said he wanted to check the trailer court one more time.  He had me drive the van with the body back here. Which we did.  It was 105 miles. 
COOPER Anything else? 
STANLEY Did Gordon show you a woman named Lil? 
COOPER I'm up to speed, Stanley. 
STANLEY Agent Chet wouldn't tell me what the Blue Rose meant. 
COOPER And neither will I. 
STANLEY (understanding) Oh, alright. (reflecting) You know, I liked Agent Desmond.  He had his own M.O. 
Stanley turns to one of his work tables and shows Cooper the Whiteman machine. 
STANLEY I cracked the Whiteman case with this. 
COOPER (trying to stop him) Stanley, I heard all about it. 
STANLEY No one could've found those splinters without a machine like this and no one has a machine like this. 
COOPER Tell me about the letter. 
STANLEY Take a look at this.  Chet and I found it under Teresa Banks' ring fingernail. 
Cooper looks under the microscope to see the letter they found on Teresa. 
COOPER And no one found the ring? 
STANLEY No, sir, we did not. 
Cooper straightens up from the microscope.  Stanley extends his hand. 
STANLEY I'm Sam Stanley, if you ever need me. 
37.     EXT.  CANYON TRAILER COURT - DAY 
Carl Rodd shows Cooper to Teresa's trailer. 
CARL GOD.  I'm beginning to lose faith in the United States Government and that includes the telephone system.  Don't you folks talk to one another.  That's her trailer there and I haven't touched a god damn thing.  Agent Chet Desmond come by a second time and asked too see Deputy Cliff Howard's trailer (gestures to the red trailer) ...which I showed him.  I went back to my trailer... (gestures back to his) After that I never saw him again. 
COOPER Thank you, Carl. 
Cooper starts walking in the opposite direction from Cliff's trailer picking up on the same odd vibe that struck Desmond. 
CARL (turning back) That's not the way to Cliff's trailer.  I told you. 
COOPER I am not going to Cliff's trailer. 
CARL Well, where are you going? 
COOPER I am going over here. 
CARL (coming along with him) God damn, you people are confusing. 
Cooper reaches a pack of dirt which is now creased with tire tracks. 
COOPER What was here, Mr. Rodd? 
CARL A trailer was here.  What the hell do you think? 
COOPER Can you tell me who's trailer it was... and who stayed in the trailer? 
CARL An old woman and her grandson. 
COOPER Can you tell me what their names were? 
CARL Chalfont.  Weird.  Chalfont was the name of the folks that rented the space before they did.  Two Chalfonts. 
Cooper kneels to examine the tracks left by the exited trailer. As he kneels and inspects the tracks he is overcome by the presence of SOMETHING. 
Cooper struggles to his feet and looks around.  Under a tree and close to the tracks is a car. 
Albert stands up. 
ALBERT Phillip? 
Jeffries moves into the room.  Cooper steps into the office. 
COOPER Phillip? 
COLE COOPER, MEET THE LONG LOST PHILLIP JEFFRIES.  YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF HIM AT THE ACADEMY. 
Jeffries stares at the threesome. 
JEFFRIES I'm not going to talk about Judy.  Keep Judy out of this. 
COOPER But... 
Cole calms Cooper. 
COLE STAND FAST, COOP. 
JEFFRIES (pointing at Cooper) Who do you think that is there? 
ALBERT (trying to calm Jeffries) Suffered some bumps on the old noggin', eh, Phil? 
COLE WHAT THE HELL DID HE SAY? (pointing at Cooper) THAT'S SPECIAL AGENT DALE COOPER. (focusing on Jeffries) ARE YOU OKAY, JEFFRIES?  WHERE THE HELL HAVE YOU BEEN? 
JEFFRIES I want to tell you everything, but I don't have a lot to go on.  But I'll tell you one thing:  Judy is positive about this. 
ALBERT How interesting.  I thought we were going to keep Judy out of this. 
Jeffries stumbles to a chair. 
JEFFRIES Listen to me carefully.  I saw one of their meetings.  It was above a convenience store. 
ALBERT Who's meeting?  Where have you been? 
COLE FOR GOD SAKES, JEFFRIES, YOU'VE BEEN GONE FOR DAMN NEAR TWO YEARS. 
JEFFRIES It was a dream. (takes Albert by the arm) We live inside a dream. 
ALBERT And it's raining Post Toasties. 
JEFFRIES (shouting) NO, NO.  I found something...  in Seattle at Judy's...  And then, there they were... 
Albert is about to say something, but is stopped by Cole's gentle pressure on his arm. 
JEFFRIES They sat quietly for hours. 
53.     INT.  ROOM ABOVE THE CONVENIENCE STORE - DAY 
SIX PEOPLE in a large, barren, filthy room.  Cheap plastic storm windows flap in the cold wind.  In the foreground the Man From Another Place (Mike) and BOB sit at a formica table.  Behind them on plastic torn chairs huddle MRS. TREMOND and her GRANDSON.  TWO BIG WOODSMEN with full beards sit quietly. 
FIRST WOODSMAN (subtitled) We have descended from pure air. 
MAN FROM ANOTHER PLACE (subtitled) Going up and down.  Intercourse between the two worlds. 
BOB (subtitled) Light of new discoveries. 
MRS. TREMOND (subtitled) Why not be composed of materials and combinations of atoms?

He touches the table. 
FIRST WOODSMAN (subtitled) Our world. 
MAN FROM ANOTHER PLACE (subtitled) With chrome.  Any everything will proceed cyclically.

TREMOND'S GRANDSON (subtitled) Fell a victim. 
The Man From Another Place raises his hand. 
MAN FROM ANOTHER PLACE (subtitled) Fire Walk With Me... 
Bob claps his hand and a circle of fire appears in the room. 
BOB (subtitled) Fire Walk With Me. 
THROUGH THE CIRCLE 
We see the RED ROOM. 
ON THE SCENE 
Bob crawls into the Red Room and Mike starts to yell and leaps in after him. 
54.     BACK IN THE FBI OFFICE 
JEFFRIES I followed. 
Jeffries begins to cry quietly at his table. 
JEFFRIES (to himself) The ring...  ring... 
COLE (hinting) ALBERT, I'LL TAKE THAT SECOND MINERAL WATER. 
DONNA (a pal) Okay, this test is going to be about the theorems I told you about last week.  You remember the... 
LAURA Don't tell me now.  Tell me right before the test.  I won't be able to remember long enough. 
DONNA You graduating this year will be proof that miracles happen. 
LAURA Thanks. 
Laura tweaks Donna's cheek. 
DONNA James called me last night looking for you. 
LAURA When? 
DONNA The usual, 9:15. 
LAURA He probably wanted to drive over. 
DONNA Were you with Bobby?  Or are you two still fighting? 
LAURA No, and yes.  I don't know what I'm going to do about Bobby.  I know he is seeing someone else and that's okay with me, and he thinks I'm seeing someone else and that's not okay with him. 
DONNA Are you going to tell him about that "someone else"? 
LAURA I don't know what to do. 
DONNA You know what your problem is? (smiles) You're just too adorable... 
LAURA (smiles back) You know, I think you're right.  I'm just too adorable. 
Donna grabs her and shakes her shoulders. 
DONNA (sing-song) Laura Palmer, you're just too adorable. 
LAURA (joining her - laughing) I'm just too adorable.  I'm just too adorable. 
They continue up the sidewalk laughing.

Establish. 
60.     INT.  TWIN PEAKS HIGH SCHOOL - DAY 
On Laura and Donna as they walk in. 
FIVE of their ADMIRERS watch Laura and Donna with love and worship. They sing a kind of pining but cool CHANT with knees bent and arms outstretched. 
ADMIRERS "Laura...  Donna...  Laura...  Donna..." 
On Donna as they continue down the hall.  A cool MIKE NELSON snaps his fingers ala Bobby for Donna to come to him.  Without missing a beat Donna changes directions.  Mike has to hustle to catch up with her. 
MIKE (putting his arm around Donna) That's why you need a real man, Babe, you're tough to handle. 
DONNA And you're the real man? 
61.     INT.  OUTSIDE THE GIRL'S BATHROOM 
JAMES HURLEY moves up behind Laura and pushes close to her. 
LAURA James...

James waits for Laura amidst the cleaning drums and brooms.  The door swings open and Laura slides in wearing only a towel.  They embrace in the half light. 
JAMES Laura, do you love me? 
LAURA Yes, I love you.  I've told you, but it doesn't really matter. 
JAMES Why?  It does. 
LAURA No, it doesn't...  just kiss me. 
JAMES It does matter.  We're in love. 
LAURA James, you don't know what you are talking about.  Quit trying to hold on so tight.  I'm gone...  long gone like a turkey through the corn. 
JAMES You're not a turkey.  A turkey is one of the dumbest birds on earth. 
LAURA (small smile) Gobble, gobble, gobble. 
71.     INT.  LAURA'S ROOM - DAY 
Laura comes into her room and drops her books on her bed.  She goes to the window and opens it - takes a package of cigarettes out, pulls one out and lights it. 
She goes to her "public" diary which she keeps on her desk.  Opens it to page one takes out a packet full of cocaine.  Like a pro she takes out her "cocaine gadget" from her purse and takes a snort.  Then another.  Big sigh of relief. 
Now she moves to her "private" diary behind her dresser - gets a pen, ready to write and starts to freak out.  Pages are missing.  First, she discovers one, then more. 
Laura panics.  Dropping her cocaine gadget back into her purse and taking her private diary, she sprints from the room. 
72.     INT.  PALMER HOUSE, ENTRANCE WAY - DAY 
Laura runs down the steps nearly colliding with her mom, SARAH PALMER, coming home with a load of groceries.  A cigarette in her mouth. 
SARAH Laura, honey... (smoke going into her tearing eyes) Cigarette...  Cigarette... 
Laura takes it out of her mouth. 
LAURA Can I take the car? 
SARAH Sure honey, what's the hurry? 
LAURA I forgot my books at school. 
Laura runs from the house. 
SARAH Laura. 
LAURA What? 
Laura looks back to see her mom dangling the car keys in front of her. Laura comes back to get the keys still holding the burning cigarette. Sarah sternly takes the cigarette from Laura's hand.  As they make the exchange. 
SARAH You'll never be a smoker if you don't 
SARAH (continued) start.  I mean it. 
Takes a drag.  With barely a nod, Laura is gone. 
73.     EXT.  TWO LANE BLACK TOP IN LOTOWN - DAY 
Laura speeds through Lotown in her mom's '56 Roadmaster Buick. 
74.     EXT.  HAROLD SMITH'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Laura skids up outside the apartment.  Then backs the car up to a darker, more enclosed area amongst some trees.  Cautiously, she gets out of the car and then hurries to Harold's door. 
AT THE DOOR 
Laura frantically knocks at the door.  HAROLD SMITH answers. 
HAROLD Laura? 
75.     INT.  HAROLD SMITH'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Laura rushes past him to the sofa, opening the book for him to see. 
LAURA My secret diary.  There are pages missing. 
HAROLD Who would do that? 
LAURA Bob. 
HAROLD But Bob isn't real. 
LAURA The pages are gone.  That's real. 
HAROLD Maybe. 
LAURA Bob is real.  He's been "having" me since I was 12. 
Stunned, Harold doesn't know what to do. 
LAURA (continued) The diary was hidden too well.  He's the only one who could know where it was. He's getting to know me, now.  He's real He speaks to me. 
HAROLD What does Bob say? 
LAURA (whisper) He wants to be me...  or he will kill me. 
HAROLD No...  No... 
LAURA (strangely) Oh, yes...  yes... 
Laura starts towards him frightening Harold. 
HAROLD What?  Please. 
She allows the feeling of Bob to come over her and she begins to scream.  Harold steps back, but Laura grabs him.  To his face with a horrifying expression on hers. 
LAURA FIRE WALK WITH ME. 
She buries herself on his shoulder. 
LAURA (whispers) The trees...  the trees... 
They break. 
LAURA (continued) You have to hide the diary, Harold.  You made me write it all down.  He doesn't know about you.  You'll be safe. 
She stares at Harold.  Her eyes widen, terrified with suspicion. 
LAURA You're not Bob are you, Harold?  If you are, you can kill me right now.  Kill me right now, if you are. 
HAROLD Laura, no, I'm not.  I'm not Bob. (begins to shake and cry) Poor Laura.  I wish I could help you. 
He holds her. 
82.     INT.  TRUCK - SAME 
The TRUCKER smiles.  Eager. 
TRUCKER Friend of Leo's, right?  Partyland? 
Laura begins to unbutton her blouse.  Turns and sneaks a toot of cocaine. 
TRUCKER (continued) (catching her) Wait a minute.  Leo says this is my party. 
Laura puts her hand between his legs. 
LAURA If you can fuck and drive the party starts right now. 
Momentarily taken aback, the trucker stares at her.  Laura takes his hand and puts it on the gear shift. 
LAURA (continued) You shift that one.  This one's mine. 
She climbs over on top of him. 
83.     EXT.  THE TRUCK - SAME 
The stack blows.  The truck rolls away onto the road.  We watch it as it moans into the distance - the sound slowly diminishing and fading. 
Natures' nighttime sounds take over.  Finally, we hear the _hooting_ _of_an_owl_. 
84.     EXT.  PHILADELPHIA FBI OFFICE - DAY 
Reestablish. 
85.     INT.  OFFICE - DAY 
Albert and Cooper. 
ALBERT Cooper, the ooze of mumbo jumbo is rising up above our heads.  Do you honestly think Cole's practice of word association works? 
COOPER The very fact that we are talking about word association means we are in a space that was opened up by our practice of word association.  The world is a hologram, Albert. 
ALBERT Yes, it's a great big psychedelic circus ride, isn't it, Cooper? 
COOPER Albert. 
ALBERT You said, "Teresa Banks", so you think something is going on somewhere in the world right now that is connected with her murder? 
COOPER Yes.  Either right now or right when I thought of it.  The name and memory of Teresa Banks is haunting me.  Lately I have been filled with a knowingness that the murderer will strike again. Because it is only a feeling, I am powerless to stop it.  And another thing, Albert, when the next murder happens you will help me solve it. 
ALBERT Let's test it for the record.  Will the next victim be a man or a woman? 
COOPER A woman. 
ALBERT What color hair will she have? 
COOPER Blonde. 
ALBERT Tell me some other things about her. 
COOPER She's in high school.  She's sexually active.  She's on drugs.  She's crying out for some help. 
ALBERT You're describing half the high school girls in America. (off Cooper's look) What is she doing right now? 
COOPER (closing his eyes to see a mental picture) She is preparing a great abundance of food. 
Albert lets go a small laugh of disbelief and shakes his head in exasperation.

Laura comes out of the kitchen stacking some of her "Meals on Wheels" on the counter. 
On screen it reads: 
"FRIDAY - SIX DAYS BEFORE" 
NORMA JENNINGS and SHELLY JOHNSON watch from the cash register. Shelly is ringing someone out, handing back their change. 
NORMA Shelly, would you give Laura a quick hand with the "Meals on Wheels"? 
SHELLY I'm kind of busy, Norma. 
NORMA You're not busy, sweetheart, now go. 
With a little squeeze of the hand and a gentle shove, Norma moves Shelly towards Laura who is at the end of the counter. 
The door opens to the Diner and ED and NADINE HURLEY come in.  Nadine stops when she sees Norma. 
NADINE I changed my mind, I don't want any coffee, Eddie. 
Nadine goes out.  As she walks past Ed he looks at Norma and makes a "What can I do" gesture. 
ED Sorry, Norma. 
Ed goes out. 
SHELLY AND LAURA 
Shelly approaches sheepishly. 
SHELLY Can I give you a hand getting the dinners together? 
LAURA That's alright, Shelly.  I know you have better things to do. 
SHELLY (disregarding the jab) Norma asked me to give you a hand. 
Laura is coming apart, sobbing.  Behind her, on the sidewalk, a NEIGHBOR has noticed her. 
WOMAN Laura... 
A closer look reveals how upset Laura is. 
WOMAN What...  Laura are you all right? 
Laura turns away so the woman can't see her crying.  The woman takes a couple of steps off the sidewalk onto the grass. 
LAURA (trying to hold it together) I...  lost my necklace...  it must have fallen. 
Laura mimes that she has found her gold half-heart necklace.  She pretends to be clasping her gold half-heart necklace which was already around her neck. 
LAURA (clumsily) Oh, here it is. 
Woman moves back to the sidewalk. 
WOMAN Well, I'm glad you found it, darling. 
Slowly, Laura stands and moves away - leaving Mrs. Tremond's picture on the grass under the tree. 
96.     EXT.  PALMER HOUSE 
Laura stands in front of her house.  Terrified. 
97.     INT.  PALMER HOUSE - SAME 
No Bob.  Listens to the house...  stands in the entrance way. 
98.     LIVING ROOM - SAME 
Laura listens.  Hears nothing. 
99.     STAIRS AND HALLWAY 
She stops and stares at the fan then slowly makes her way up the stairs towards her room. 
100.    INT.  LAURA'S ROOM - SAME 
No Bob in her room.  The dresser is back in its place.  Laura races out. 
101.    EXT.  PALMER NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - DAY 
Laura runs down the sidewalk. 
102.    INT.  HAYWARD HOUSE - DAY 
Donna answers the door.  Laura stands there out of breath. 
DONNA Laura? 
LAURA Donna, are you my best friend? 
DONNA Of course... 
Laura dives toward Donna and into a hug. 
DONNA What is it Laura?  What's wrong? 
LAURA I just want a friend.  Just one friend for just one minute... 
DONNA Laura, how about one friend for the rest of your whole life? 
LAURA Yes, that's what I want.  Thanks D. 
DONNA Okay, L. (looks into Laura's eyes, a step toward confronting something unspoken) I am your friend...  always.  But sometimes...  lately...  I feel that you don't like being around me because I am so uptight. (off Laura's look) No, I am uptight.  I hate it...  I don't want to be this way, but Laura I don't...  I mean...  I'm your friend no matter what way you are. 
LAURA You know, even when I think about your face I get happier. 
They go in and sit down on the couch. 
DONNA Do you want to talk? 
LAURA No, I want to smoke. 
She digs for a cigarette in her purse. 
DONNA I'm in a mess today, too. (takes a breath) I'm thinking about doing it with Mike. What do you think? 
LAURA (still looking for a cigarette) Donna, you are such a crack up.  You don't even like Mike.  Is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight. 
DONNA This is about sex, not like. (yells to the kitchen) Mom, Laura's here and I think I will have one of those huckleberry muffins. (to Laura) You want a muffin? 
LAURA If I can smoke it. 
DONNA You want a muffin? 
LAURA Donna, you are a muffin. 
They hear DOC HAYWARD in the kitchen.  He walks in with a magician's handkerchief.  With a flourish he tries to pull something out of it. Instead he stands there empty handed. 
DOC The red rose.  Where is the red rose? (frustrated) You know the light at Sparkwood and 21?  It worked right there.  I just did it right there. 
Laura finds a cigarette finally and lights it. 
DOC (stands and stares at Laura smoking) Why is it that you can't smoke at your home and I'm a doctor and I don't allow smoking in my home and I let you smoke in my home? 
LAURA (smiling her killer smile) Because you love me so much. 
DOC I do love you, you little smoking whipper snapper. 
Eileen Hayward brings out the muffins on her lap in her wheel chair. All four have muffins. 
EILEEN These muffins each have at least seven full huckleberries in them. 
LELAND How do you know what she doesn't like? 
A beat then a return to what is normal. 
SARAH Oh, Leland, sit down and eat you dinner. 
LELAND Oh, I'll sit down, but none of us are going to start eating till Laura goes and washes her hands. 
Leland sits stoically.  Laura rises from the table. 
104.    INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT 
As Laura washes her hands, she stares at her reflection.  Terrified.

LAURA'S CLOCK 
It says:  10:35. 
106.    INT.  LELAND AND SARAH'S BEDROOM 
Sarah and Leland get ready for bed.  Leland stops, stands frozen for a moment, then begins to cry. 
SARAH What is it, Leland? 
Leland can barely speak. 
LELAND I can't remember the last time I told Laura that I loved her. 
Sarah goes to Leland.  They embrace, tenderly, across the many years of their strained marriage. 
SARAH Well, honey, go in and tell her now. 
107.    INT.  LAURA'S BEDROOM 
Laura stares at the hands of the clock.  With a start, she looks up. Her father is in her room.  He stands in the doorway. 
LELAND Laura, honey... 
He moves to her and touches her face. 
LELAND (continued) I love you.  I love you so much. 
Laura can hardly speak.  She squeezes his hand. 
LELAND Goodnight, Princess. 
He leaves the room.  Laura watches the door close.  She sits frozen for a moment, with a tear in her eye, then she remembers something. 
MRS. TREMOND'S PICTURE 
The picture lies there in the night dew under the tree in the neighbor's yard. 
108.    EXT.  PALMER HOUSE, OUTSIDE LAURA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Laura goes down the trellises and runs across the lawn. 
109.    EXT.  NEIGHBOR'S LAWN - NIGHT 
Laura hunts around the tree for the picture, finally finds it.  She runs back towards her house. 
110.    INT.  LAURA'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Laura climbs through the window and hangs the picture on a little hook on the wall and crawls into bed.  She turns off the light and stares at the picture in the dark. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
111.    INT.  LAURA PALMER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
She is asleep. 
112.    MRS. TREMOND'S PICTURE 
We hold on the picture.  As if by magic, we suddenly begin to move into the picture - into the room in the picture and thru the dark doorway in the room in the picture. 
On the other side of the dark doorway there is another room. Mrs. Tremond is standing in that room.  She is beckoning us towards her and beyond her thru yet another doorway.  We move thru the second doorway and on the other side of that doorway there is another room. 
Mrs. Tremond's grandson is standing in that room.  He is holding his hands above him as if he is grasping an imaginary glass ball.  As we move towards the space between his hands a ring of fire appears there and we move thru that into... 
113.    INT.  RED ROOM 
The MAN FROM ANOTHER PLACE walks into the red room to a table. A ring lies upon the table. 
COOPER ENTERS THE RED ROOM.  The Man From Another Place turns toward Cooper. 
MAN FROM ANOTHER PLACE Is it future?  Or is it past?...  Do you know who I am?...  I am the Arm...  And I sound like this... 
The Man From Another Place puts his hand in front of his lips and makes an Indian Whooping sound. 
The Man From Another Place picks up the ring and moves it very close to us.  We recognize it as Teresa Banks' ring.  The symbols on the ring are identical to the symbols of Owl Cave. 
Cooper seems concerned. 
COOPER (to camera) Don't take the ring...  Laura, don't take the ring. 
The Man From Another Place moves the ring towards us till the ring fills the screen. 
114.    BACK IN LAURA'S ROOM 
Laura in a somnambular state is half awakened by a noise.  She tries to move her left arm, but it has fallen asleep.  She moves it with her right arm. 
SFX: THE NOISE 
LAURA Mom...  what are you wearing? 
Sarah looks down.  She is wearing the sweater that she is looking for. 
SARAH My god, I am going to have another breakdown.  God, god. 
LAURA Mom, take it easy. 
Laura starts down the stairs towards her mother. 
SARAH No, no... this can't be happening. 
Laura holds her mother. 
LAURA Mom, you're not having a nervous breakdown. 
Sarah pulls away from Laura and wanders into the living room.  Laura watches her go feeling helpless. 
119.    INT.  JOHNSON'S KITCHEN - DAY 
LEO JOHNSON is ragging on Shelly.  He is down on his hands and knees showing her how to scrub the floor. 
LEO Someone who knows how to clean knows where the object was before she started cleaning and then that object goes back to its exact same spot. Shelly, I know where everything in this house is.  Sometimes on the road I mentally go through this whole house and picture where every item is. 
SHELLY Lay off the bennies, Leo. 
LEO (continuing his tirade) Anybody can clean the surface of an object, but dirt can find its way anywhere.  To really clean, you have to scrub below the surface. (shouting) WHERE THE DIRT IS, SHELLY. 
He scrubs more. 
LEO (continued) That's one thing you are going to learn, Shelly, - HOW TO CLEAN.  It takes scrubbing, Shelly.  There is no easy way. THIS IS WHERE WE LIVE, SHELLY. 
SHELLY As if I didn't know. 
LEO I'm going to show you how to wash this tile and then you're going to do it. 
SHELLY Come off it, Leo.  I'm late for work... 
LEO What did you say? 
Leo goes over the top pulls Shelly down to the floor. 
LEO Shelly, I am not fooling around anymore. The first thing you've got to WORK on is a good attitude.  That's the key. Anybody will tell you that. 
Gives her a good shot to the back of the head.  Shelly falls to the floor.  The phone rings.  Leo gets up to get the phone. 
LEO Don't even _think_ about going anywhere, Shelly.  I'm not finished with you. 
He answers the phone. 
LEO What are you doing calling me here?... No way, you already owe me money... Five thousand, to be exact. 
Leo looks over at Shelly suspiciously.  (Did she hear him mention the five thousand?) 
SHELLY (silently mouthing it) Five Thousand??? 
120.    INT.  DOUBLE R - DAY 
Bobby is calling from the pay phone at the diner.  We hear the end of the conversation with Leo.  Bobby hangs up.  He puts in another quarter and dials again.  The phone rings on the other end. 
121.    INT.  ROADHOUSE - DAY 
A nearly empty Roadhouse.  JACQUES RENAULT answers the phone behind the bar. 
JACQUES How come you only call me when you are desperate?  Are you desperate, baby?

123.    EXT.  PALMER HOUSE - NIGHT 
Donna drives up in her car and gets out. 
124.    INT.  PALMER HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Laura is having a quick shot from the family liquor cabinet.  A knock on the door.  Laura pulls a jacket on and goes to the door.  Opens it and sees Donna.  Donna looks at her coat. 
DONNA Where are you going? 
LAURA No place, fast. (a warning) And you're not coming. 
DONNA Come on, Laura.  I'm your best friend. 
They move back into the living room. 
LAURA (change of subject) Isn't tonight the night you are going to do it with Mike? 
DONNA Laura, aren't you going to fix me a drink? 
Laura shoots her a look. 
DONNA Where are the Cookies? 
LAURA You mean Fred and Ginger? 
Donna starts making out with Buck. 
133.    EXT.  BORDER TRUCK STOP - NIGHT 
Establish.  Tommy takes the car like a rocket into the parking lot and does a complete three sixty before rocking to a stop.  Several big rigs shadow the lot.  They all pop out of Buck's car sporting "long necks". 
Laura takes a hit of cocaine and looks up to see Donna watching. Buck circles Donna with his big arm and puts a toot under her nose. 
DONNA No. (turns to Laura) I don't need to take this to be you friend. 
LAURA YES YOU DO, DONNA.  What a downer you are!!! 
BUCK (pointing to skid marks behind a heat popping car) Hey, Tommy, Jacques beat us here. 
TOMMY Hold on, I'm chokin' the farm fed. 
Tommy stands in the lot with his back to them, pissing. 
134.    INT.  BORDER TRUCK STOP - NIGHT 
The front room is a bar and restaurant with about THREE PATRONS. Above the bar is a sign that reads: 
CAN - A - DO and U.S. OF FUCKIN' "A" 
The BARTENDER presses a release underneath the counter that allows Laura to take her three friends thru a door over which a sign hangs announcing in red neon letters: 
"PARTYLAND" 
135.    INT.  PARTYLAND 
The group enters a large room with the filthiest wall to wall carpet imaginable.  In the back corner is a small stage.  On it a three piece HELL-METAL BAND is building up toward oblivion.  The LEAD SINGER is dressed in a buffalo skin complete with at least half the buffalo head and horns.  He wears spray painted, day glow orange cowboy boots. 
Some HALF DRESSED GIRLS and COWBOYS are dancing to the band.  In darkened corners away from the stage other groups are racing the band to oblivion. 
Laura leans over to Donna noticing her shocked look. 
LAURA Don't expect a turkey dog in here. 
Jacques Renault comes up to the group. 
JACQUES Hey, slow pokes, guess what?  There's no tomorrow. 
He grabs Laura up and gives her a big, sloppy wet kiss. 
JACQUES Baby, you know why?  Cause it'll never get here. 
LAURA Hey, Jacques... 
JACQUES (slurred) No "Jacques".  I am the Great Went. 
LAURA (for Donna) I am The Muffin. 
JACQUES And what a muffin you have. 
The two truckers laugh with Jacques.  He mimes a gun with his right hand and pointing it to his forehead pulls the trigger with a weak, slack cheeked puff sound. 
JACQUES (slurred) I am as blank as a fart. 
Laura winks at Buck as he SECRETLY drops a red depth charge into Donna's beer. 
LAURA Hey, Donna, chug-a-lug. 
As the cowboys gather around and begin to chant, both Laura and Donna chug down their drinks.  They finish and Laura smiles and pushes Donna out onto the dance floor. 
They start to dance expertly and smile at each other.  Soon Buck and Tommy cut in separating the two. 
Buck dances Laura over to ANOTHER of his buddies.  The two of them start to unbutton Laura's blouse as they dance. 
The hell-metal band kicks into high gear.  In the pulsating red and black light Donna sees Laura now topless dancing and kissing with Buck and his friend.  Donna stops.  Jacques sweeps in. 
JACQUES Oh, Laura's friend.  I am "The Great Went". 
Jacques holds her head in his huge hands. 
JACQUES (continued) There is no tomorrow.

The room starts to spin.

WE MOVE AROUND THRU THE EVENING 
136.    INT.  ROADHOUSE 
DONNA 
A completely stoned Donna is being dances around by Tommy, who is falling in love with her.  Through some dancing legs and feet she spots Laura's blouse on the floor.  Teetering she leans over, picks up the blouse, and ties it around her waist. 
RONETTE PULASKI, flying high, makes her way through the crowd to Laura.  They spot each other and give each other a hug. 
RONETTE You smell nice. 
LAURA Haven't seen you since I was thrown out of One Eyed Jacks. 
RONETTE (trying to focus on Laura) What else did we do together?  Oh, I remember... (tries to dance with Laura) Hey, you know what?  It's been a year. She's been dead a year...  she's been dead a year. 
Jacques comes up to them. 
JACQUES The party twins.  My high school sandwich.  Let's put some meat inside... 
The three of them move around together. 
RONETTE She's been dead a year. 
TRUMAN What are you afraid of?  What people think? 
JOSIE I don't want to offend the customs of your country. 
TRUMAN Believe me, Josie, you would not offend the customs of this country.  For instance, I don't eat fish eyes. 
JOSIE Fish eyes? 
TRUMAN Even if it offended someone, I wouldn't eat a fish eye. 
JOSIE Why wouldn't you eat a fish eye, Harry? 
TRUMAN I saw a guy eat a fish eye once in Seattle.  He was digging through his food with his chopsticks for about five minutes till he found the fish eye and he dropped it into his throat.  I guess it must have gotten stuck in his uvula because right away he started to have trouble.  His throat began to flutter there like there was a wind blowing. And he couldn't swallow and they rushed to him and loosened his collar and they were asking him if he was alright and he started to turn blue and his eyes started to roll back into his head and he still couldn't get the fish eye out and they tried to do a Heimlich maneuver.  I went over to him as they were preparing to do an emergency tracheotomy.  They were over him with a knife when he suddenly shot the fish eye out of his throat and right onto the ceiling.  Splat!  It just stuck up there and spread out.  It was about the size of a half dollar.  And that's why I don't ever eat fish eyes. 
He plays the guitar for Josie.  Then stops. 
TRUMAN (continued) I'm not saying it's right or wrong, it's just the way I feel.  It's the custom thing I was thinking of.  In America we don't use any part of the fish but the meat just to the side of the insides.  We throw away the tail, the rest of the insides and the head. 
JOSIE I understand. 
TRUMAN We throw away the _whole_ head. 
141.    INT.  MOTEL ROOM - DAY 
PHILIP GERARD, the one armed man, in a deep sweat kneels in front of a circle of twelve lit candles, fighting for air and struggling to hear something.

Donna and Laura sit across from one another on the couch. 
DONNA I can't remember anything about last night.  Is there something I should remember? 
LAURA No, you should forget about last night. 
DONNA Laura, I am your friend. 
LAURA I know you are and you don't have to do anything crazy to prove it. 
DONNA You're not mad at me? 
LAURA No. 
DONNA I feel so bad.  I had nightmares all night long. (studies her friend) They all knew you at that place. 
LAURA What can I tell you? 
DONNA How did the car get back here? 
LAURA WE got it back, that's all. 
DONNA How did I get in the house?  How did I get into my bed? 
LAURA I can't help you there. 
DONNA Was I wearing something of yours and you got mad at me? 
LAURA All my things have me in them.  I don't want you to be like me. 
DONNA But I love you, Laura. 
LAURA And I love you, too.  But don't wear my stuff. 
DONNA Why do you do it, Laura? 
LAURA Cause I like it. 
She takes Donna's head into her hands and kisses her.

Leland and Laura drive along.  Leland becomes preoccupied with something in his rear view mirror.  Laura turns to see a car erratically coming up behind them.  Leland slows down and stops for a red light at Sparkwood and Twenty One.  In front of them is a huge logging truck.  Laura smells something. 
LAURA Dad, is the engine on fire?  Something is burning. 
Leland turns and gives her a look. 
The car that was tailing them races around them, races around the logging truck, and comes back around stopping on Leland's side of the car. 
Leland spots Gerard, the one armed man, behind the wheel - sweating like crazy. 
LAURA (continued) Something is burning. 
JERRY Happy Birthday, Johnny. 
Ben reacts to a huge moccasin print in the middle of the birthday cake in the middle of his office floor. 
BEN Why did we have to have the party here in my office? 
SYLVIA Because Johnny wants it in your office. What's so "private" "private" about your office, anyway?  Why can't we have the party in your precious office? 
JERRY It's a lovely place for a party, Ben.  And look at the new decorations Johnny's provided. 
They look down and see Johnny's foot completely ringed in white frosting roses.  Frosted footprints trail behind him everywhere. 
Johnny goes one inch in front of Laura's picture. 
JOHNNY Happy Birthday, Johnny. 
Leland looks again at Laura's picture.  He looks up at Ben. 
LELAND (oddly confrontational) Don't you have a picture of Audrey, Ben? 
That sets Sylvia off again. 
SYLVIA Don't you have a picture of your own daughter, Ben?  Where's Johnny's picture? (exploding) And where's _my_ picture I gave you? 
BEN At the photographer's studio getting a gold frame with floral monograms of your birthday and our wedding vows. 
Johnny moves one inch in front of Ben. 
JOHNNY Happy Birthday, Johnny. 
BEN (trying not to explode) Happy Birthday, Johnny. 
JERRY Johnny, Johnny...  let your Daddy and your Uncle and Leland talk. (turning to Ben) Ben...  Leland, we can play the French against the Norwegians.  What do the French love more than anything? 
LELAND (part of Jerry's presentation) Boating?

LELAND Hiking? 
JERRY No. 
LELAND Eating? 
JERRY You'd think so. 
LELAND Sex? 
JERRY You're getting warmer. 
LELAND Trees? 
JERRY Exactment.  They are nuts about wood. They get goofy over trees. 
SYLVIA I've never heard anything like this before.  The French liking wood anymore than anyone else likes wood.  Are you three crazy? 
LELAND Sarah's cousin is French and she can't stop talking about the trees around here. 
JERRY History is on our side, Ben.  It's no accident that the great explorers were named Hennepin, Nicollet, Marquette. 
LELAND They were looking for wood. 
SYLVIA (exasperated) Oh... 
As they talk Johnny circles the blowup Indian and with a mighty bang pops it with his tomahawk.  "Bang".

ANDY He's coming in on foot. 
TRUMAN That's right, Andy. (looks at him, waiting) I guess you're saying there's an awful lot of trails for us to cover.

LUCY'S VOICE (continued) thing. 
ANDY Okay, Sheriff Truman. 
LUCY'S VOICE Raccoons remind me of my aunt who lives in Wyoming where they have raccoons, too. 
Truman stands up, puts on his gun and leaves.  Lucy's voice continues as we watch Andy sit there alone. 
LUCY'S VOICE (continued) She couldn't get rid of her raccoons because she made the big mistake of feeding them albacore tuna.  I don't know why she fed them albacore tuna. And albacore tuna is so expensive. (voice raising an octave) Sheriff Truman how did you get up here? 
Over the intercom Andy hears Lucy make a small hysterical cry.  He stands and runs from the room.  Stay on the intercom.  Lucy's voice continues.

LAURA (frantically to herself) Go inside...  go inside...

LEO Bite the bullet, baby. 
Like a ghost Leland appears in the window. 
No one sees him. 
Laura continues to scream.  Leo gets up and goes for the bottle of bourbon.  He takes a swig and then steps back to Jacques and Laura. 
LEO (referring to Laura) Let me have a little of that. 
JACQUES (pointing at the bourbon) Let me have a little of that, baby. 
Leo holds the bottle tight.  Jacques stands up and decks Leo with his big French Canadian paw.  He grabs the spilling bottle from the floor and stumbles outside.

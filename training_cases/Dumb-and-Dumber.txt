FADE IN: 
EXT. PROVIDENCE, RHODE ISLAND - WINTER MORNING 
A PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN is standing on the street corner waiting for a bus. She's carrying books and looking very collegiate. 
A black stretch LIMOUSINE with darkened windows drives past, SLAMS ON ITS BRAKES, and backs up. The Young Woman stares at her reflection in the windows, wondering what this is all about. 
Finally, the REAR PASSENGER WINDOW zips down, revealing LLOYD CHRISTMAS, age 30. He's a pleasant-enough looking guy, if a little shaggy. He's wearing a dark suit. 
LLOYD Excuse me, can you tell me how to get to the medical school? I'm supposed to be giving a lecture in twenty minutes and my driver's a bit lost. 
YOUNG WOMAN (heavy European accent) Go straight aheads and makes a left over za bridge. 
Lloyd checks out her body. 
LLOYD I couldn't help noticing the accent. You from Jersey? 
YOUNG WOMAN (unimpressed) Austria. 
LLOYD Austria? You're kidding. (mock-Australian accent) Well, g'day, mate. What do you say we get together later and throw a few shrimp on the barbie. 
The Young Woman turns her back to him and walks away. 
LLOYD (CONT'D) (to self) Guess I won't be going Down Under tonight... 
He SIGHS and zips the window back up. 
INT. LIMO 
Lloyd climbs through the driver's partition into the front seat. Then he puts a CHAUFFEUR'S CAP on his head and drives away. We see that HE'S THE DRIVER! 
The dispatch radio CRACKLES TO LIFE: 
DISPATCHER (v.o.) Carr 22, come in, car 22... 
Lloyd grabs his CB mike. 
LLOYD This is 22. 
DISPATCHER 22, where the hell are you, Lloyd? You're running late on the East Side pick-up. 
LLOYD Cool your jets, Arnie. I'm on my way. 
DISPATCHER (v.o.) Well hurry it up. And make sure you park legally. One more ticket and your ass is history. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. MUTT CUTS DOG SALON - DAY This building is white with black spots on it, like a DALMATION. Over the front door is an awning shaped like a DOG'S SNOUT, whiskers included. A van pulls up outside. 
The vehicle is decorated like a GIANT POODLE, with four legs hanging off the sides, a tail in the rear, and a dog's snout on the front grill. MUTT CUTS is written on the side of it. 
HARRY DUNNE climbs out. He's in his early 30s and dressed in a ridiculous BEAGLE COSTUME, including a CAP WITH FLOPPY EARS. He goes to the rear of the van, opens it, and a swarm of DOGS pile out. 
HARRY Okay, gang, single file. You know the rules: No pushing, no humping, and no sniffing heinies... 
The door to the shop opens and Harry's annoyed boss, MR. PALMER, sticks his head out. 
PALMER Hey, why aren't those mutts on leashes? 
HARRY The same reason you're not on a leash, sir because it's demeaning and it chafes like hell. 
PALMER Just get them in here now! They all have to be bathed and clipped in an hour. 
Palmer disappears back inside. Harry CALLS to the dogs but they pay no attention. He struggles to keep them from wandering off. He grabs a couple of SMALL POOCHES and sits them on a wall. 
HARRY You kids stay right here... 
As he turns to round up the other, we discover that the wall isn't a wall it's a flatbed truck. The truck drives away, taking the two dogs with it. 
HARRY (CONT'D) (at truck) Hey, wait a minute! 
Harry chases after the vehicle. 
CUT TO: EXT. EAST SIDE ESTATE - DAY 
Lloyd Christmas pulls the limousine into a long, tree-lined driveway. He gets out and looks up in awe at an IMPRESSIVE STONE MANSION. He WHISTLES to himself, then walks to the front oor and RINGS THE BELL. 
The double-front doors of the mansion open and MARY SWANSON appears. She's 25 and gorgeous. Lloyd's jaw drops open when he lays eyes on her. 
MARY Hello. (beat) I'll be just a minute... 
As Mary steps back inside, Lloyd takes out a tiny can of Binaca. He sprays his mouth, under his arms, his hair, behind his ears... 
CUT TO: 
Mary looks tense as she moves through the throngs of travelers. Her pace is slow, deliberate, and her eyes are focused straight ahead. 
She passes a row of phone botths and two MEN one dressed in an ARMANI SUIT, the other in a PLAID SPORTCOAT watch her. 
ARMANI SUIT She's gonna leave the briefcase at the foot of the escalator. You make the pick-up. 
PLAID SPORTCOAT Piece of cake. 
EXT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY As Lloyd pulls his limo slowly away, he glances in the airport window and SEES MARY 
WALKING ALONG. 
When she stops at the foot of the escalator, he stops, too. She puts down the briefcase and checks her coat pocket for her ticket. Lloyd's attention is distracted by a HONK. He turns to see a car irectly behind him. 
LLOYD (to car's driver) Drive around me, you pinhead! 
When he turns back to watch Mary in the terminal he sees that SHE'S GONE, and she's LEFT HER BRIEFCASE AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS. Lloyd jumps to ATTENTION. 
He pulls the car into a HANDICAPPED SPOT and hops out. He starts to run into the terminal, then notices the Police Officer and suddenly goes into a spastic walk, limping and dragging him leg behind him like a palsy victim. 
INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL 
The Armani Man nods to the Plaid Sportcoat and he starts to approach the briefcase. Just as Plaid Sportcoat is reaching for the handle, LLOYD RUNS BY AND GRABS IT. He CONTINUES UP THE ESCALATOR three steps at a time. The two men look at each other, dumbstruck. 
INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - BOARDING GATE 
Lloyd runs with the briefcase to the TV monitors that post the departure times. He looks frantically at the confusion of numbers. 
LLOYD Damn! 
QUICK CUT of a dejected Lloyd looking out the window as he watches as Mary's airplane taxiing away. 
EXT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY 
Lloyd comes out with the briefcase, passing the two men, who FOLLOW HIM AT A DISTANCE. He starts walking down the sidewalk when suddenly he STOPS IN HIS TRACKS. 
HIS POV - his limo is being towed away    under the supervision of the Police Officer. 
He takes off after it, but to no avail. LLOYD You can't do this! I'll lose my job! 
As Lloyd watches the limo get towed out of site, he runs his fingers through his hair. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - AFTERNOON 
We see the Mutt Cuts van pull up and park at the curb. A dejected Harry climbs out. At the same time, a taxi pulls up and drops off Lloyd. (He's clutching Mary Swanson's briefcase.) Both he and Harry climb the steps of the building. They disappear inside without acknowledging each other. 
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET - a black Cadillac pulls up and parks. Inside are the Armani suit and the Sportcoat. They are J.P. SHAY and JOSEPH MENTALINO (aka JOE 
MENTAL). 
MENTAL Who the hell do you figure this guy's working for? 
SHAY I don't know, but we'd better find out... 
Mental takes some PILLS and starts CHOMPING them. 
SHAY (CONT'D) Your ulcer? 
MENTAL It ain't gonna kill me. 
INT. APARTMENT CORRIDOR 
Lloyd and Harry trudge up the stairs and proceed silently toward the door of their apartment. 
INT. APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM 
Lloyd and Harry ENTER and   pass each other quietly as they both plunk down in their   favorite easy chairs. (Lloyd still has the briefcase in his   lap.) Harry's caged parakeet, PETEY, tweets hello, but the two   guys just sit there SILENTLY. 
The place is a mess. Wallpaper's peeling off the walls. The carpet is threadbare and filthy. In the corner we see a miniature WORM FARM and a large terrarium filled with dirt and worms. Here are a couple pieces of haggard furniture with stuffing spilling out of the gashes. 
HARRY I got fired again. 
Lloyd shakes his head. 
LLOYD I don't mean to be harsh, Harry, but let's face it, you are one pathetic loser. No offense. 
HARRY None taken. Were you shitcanned, too? 
LLOYD Of course not. (beat) I quit. 
HARRY Why'd you quit? 
LLOYD I had a hunch Arnie was gonna fire me. 
INT. HARRY & LLOYD'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON 
J.P. Shay is looking through Harry and Lloyd's kitchen cupboards as Joe Mental comes out of the bedroom. 
MENTAL The briefcase ain't here. He must've taken it with him. 
J.P. SHAY Shit. (beat) Well he's gotta come home sometime. 
Joe Mental ominously approaches Petey the parakeet's cage. 
MENTAL Maybe we should leave him a little message to let 'em know we're playing hardball. 
Mental opens the cage door and wraps his meaty fist around the bird, who SCREECHES IN 
TERROR. 
MENTAL (CONT'D) (a la Tweety Bird) I taut I taw a puddy cat. 
Mental smiles, and as we PAN to J.P. Shay, we hear a bone- chilling O.S. SNAP and Petey the bird stops SQUAWKING. 
MENTAL (CONT'D) (still Tweety) I did, I did... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
The Mutt Cuts van pulls up to the curb. A depressed Lloyd and Harry climb out and mope up to their apartment building entrance. 
LLOYD Give me what's left of our dough. I'll go to the corner and buy a few necessities. 
Harry hands his friend some crumpled bills. 
LLOYD (CONT'D) What's cheaper, Thunderbird or Night Train? 
HARRY Get Robitussin it's a better buzz. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. CORNER GROCERY STORE - NIGHT 
Lloyd comes out of the store with his arms full of groceries. He stops at a newspaper machine, pulls out his WALLET and removes a quarter. 
He drops the quarter in the machine, opens it, and realizes that he DOESN'T HAVE A FREE HAND to pick up the newspaper. He puts his wallet inside the machine, picks up the newspaper, and as he does so THE MACHINE SLAMS SHUT WITH HIS WALLET STILL INSIDE. 
Lloyd SIGHS, puts his grocery bags on the machine, and checks his pockets. NO MORE CHANGE. Just then, an ELDERLY WOMAN struggles by using a WALKER. 
LLOYD Excuse me, little old lady, do you have change for a dollar? 
ELDERLY WOMAN Change? No, I'm sorry, I don't... 
LLOYD Well could you do me a favor and guard this while I go break a dollar? My wallet's locked in this machine. 
ELDERLY LADY Of course, young man... 
Lloyd runs back into the store. We HOLD ON THE STORE DOOR as Lloyd EXITS a few seconds later with a handful of quarters. Suddenly he stops in his tracks. The ELDERLY LADY, HER WALKER, AND HIS GROCERIES ARE GONE. As he takes a closer look, he sees that 
SHE HAS TAKEN HIS WALLET ALSO. 
CUT TO: 
INT. APARTMENT BUILDING STAIRWELL - NIGHT 
A thoroughly beleaguered Lloyd is trudging empty-handed up the steps to his apartment. 
INT. LLOYD & HARRY'S APARTMENT 
The door opens and Lloyd ENTERS. Harry is sitting on the couch, looking almost comatose. 
HARRY Where's the booze? 
LLOYD It's gone. I got robbed by Grandma Walton. She got my wallet, too. 
Harry drops his head and lets out a MOAN. 
LLOYD (CONT'D) Come on, man, cheer up. We've been own before. I'm sure we'll land on our heads somewhere. HARRY It gets worse, Lloyd. My parakeet Petey he's... he's dead. 
Lloyd looks touched by this. 
LLOYD Oh man, I'm sorry, Harry. What happened? 
HARRY His head fell off. 
LLOYD His head fell off? 
HARRY Yeah, he was pretty old. 
Lloyd puts his hand on Harry's shoulder compassionately. 
LLOYD Or was it the left shoulder? 
They turn and see a burly TRUCKER wiping salt out of his eyes. 
TRUCKER Who's the dead man threw shit in my eye? 
The huge Trucker stands and squints at Lloyd and Harry. He's wearing a FOAM BASEBALL CAP that says: WINE 'EM, DINE 'EM, SIXTY-NINE 'EM. 
HARRY It was a terrible accident, Sir. Believe me, I would never do anything to offend a man of your size. Please accept my most sincere apology. 
The Trucker GROWLS and approaches the table, egged on by his equally burly FRIENDS. 
BURLY FRIEND #1 Teach him a lesson, Sea Bass! 
Sea Bass glares down at Harry's hamburger. 
SEA BASS You gonna eat that? 
HARRY Um... the thought had crossed my mind. 
At this, Sea Bass leans over and DROPS A BIG, BROWN WAD OF TOBACCO SPIT ONTO 
THE HAMBURGER. 
SEA BASS Still want it? 
Harry stares at the burger non-commitally. 
HARRY Nah, you go ahead. 
Sea Bass picks up the burger and walks back to his table, to the LAUGHTER of his friends. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. TRUCK STOP CAFÉ - AFTERNOON 
J.P. Shay is at the gas pump filling the black Cadillac while Joe Mental stretches his legs. A large truck pulls away, REVEALING THE PREVIOUSLY HIDDEN MUTT CUTTS VAN. Mental smiles at this, and we 
CUT TO: 
INT. TRUCK STOP CAFÉ The Waitress drops the check on Lloyd and Harry's table and STOMPS away. Harry studies the bill and SIGHS. 
HARRY Perfect. I'm out eight bucks and I still haven't eaten. 
LLOYD Well if you'd stop picking fights with the locals... (brightening) Wait a second. I think I just had an idea. Follow me... 
Lloyd stands and walks over to Sea Bass and his pals. A nervous Harry trails after him. 
LLOYD (CONT'D) Excuse me, gentlemen, I'd just like to apologize for that unpleasant scene a little earlier. 
SEA BASS Huh? 
LLOYD What I'm trying to say is, my friend and I would like to buy you guys a round of beers, just to bury the hatchet. 
Harry stares at Lloyd like he's out of his mind, but the Truckers seem to like the idea. 
SEA BASS Make it four boiler-makers. 
LLOYD Whatever you want, sir. I'll have the waitress send them over. Oh, and fellas hope to see you again down the road. 
Lloyd and Harry move away from the table toward the CASHIER. 
HARRY Lloyd, what are you doing? You know we can't afford to buy them drinks. 
Lloyd hands the Cashier their check. 
LLOYD Um, Sea Bass and the fellas offered to pick up our check. They said just add this to their tab. 
CASHIER (skeptical) Sea Bass said that? 
LLOYD Well, if that guy at the table over there is Sea Bass... 
He points across the room to Sea Bass and company. Sea Bass NODS TO THE CASHIER AND GESTURES TO HIS TABLE, NOT WANTING TO MISS OUT ON HIS FREE DRINK. The Cashier is convinced. 
CASHIER Okey-dokey, if that's what he wants... 
Harry smiles at this. He grabs a couple Beef Jerky's, a candy bar, and a copy of The National Enquirer off the counter. 
HARRY Oh, and put these on there, too. 
CASHIER You got it. 
LLOYD (to Cashier) By the way, how far is it to Rhode Island from here? 
CUT TO: 
Harry glances down at his sweater he's wearing, then back at the Trooper. 
HARRY (calling out) No, it's a Cardigan! But thanks for noticing! 
He rolls his window back up and turns to an equally baffled Lloyd. 
HARRY (CONT'D) Jesus, what is this, the fashion police? 
The Cop turns on his SIREN. 
STATE TROOPER PULL YOUR CAR TO THE SIDE OF THE 
ROAD! 
CUT TO: 
EXT. HIGHWAY - LATE DAY 
The STATE TROOPER is walking up beside the stopped Mutt Cutts van, staring at it with isapproval. 
STATE TROOPER License and registration, please. 
Harry hands him the papers. STATE TROOPER (CONT'D) You know, you fellas were all over the road back there. 
HARRY Yes, sir, we had a little... ifficulty in the car. 
STATE TROOPER Uh-huh. (beat) Have you boys been doing a little rinking maybe? 
HARRY No, sir. 
STATE TROOPER Then what's that? 
He points to the OPEN, FULL BEER BOTTLES hidden in the seat between them. 
HARRY Oh, that's nothing, sir. 
STATE TROOPER Do you know it's against the law to rive with an open alcohol container in this state? 
LLOYD But, your honor, he's telling the truth. It's not beer. 
The officer smirks. 
STATE TROOPER Is that right? 
The Trooper reaches in and picks up one of the bottles. He inspects the beer label, then MOVES 
THE BOTTLE TO HIS LIPS. 
HARRY Sir, I wouldn't TROOPER --You'd keep your mouth shut if you knew what was good for you. 
LLOYD (under breath) YOU WOULD, TOO... 
Harry shoots Lloyd a look as the Trooper begins GULPING down the piss. He pauses uncertainly and a SICK LOOK COMES OVER HIS FACE. He takes a DEEP BREATH. Then: 
STATE TROOPER (pained) Get the hell out of here. 
CUT TO: 
The Mutt Cutts van is pulling back onto the highway while the officer remains in the breakdown lane with his hands on his knees. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT 
The van is making steady progress through the dark night. 
INT. MUTT CUTT VAN - NIGHT 
Lloyd is driving now while Harry sleeps in the passenger seat. The song, "Cut Flowers" by The Smithereens, starts to play as Lloyd FANTASIZES about his future in Aspen. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
LLOYD'S FANTASY: 
Lloyd is walking up the steps of a luxurious, snow-covered chalet, carrying Mary's briefcase. The sky is absurdly blue and children are making a snowman on the lawn. It's all out of a dream world. He KNOCKS on the door, tentatively. Mary opens it. She looks at him, then at the briefcase, and breaks into the BIGGEST, SWEETEST SMILE he's ever seen. Then she slowly backs into the house, gesturing for him to follow... 
Lloyd follows Mary down a hallway. As he trails after her, she pulls off her shirt, revealing her bare back, and glances over her shoulder at him. 
CAMERA MOVES around a corner and now we're in a STEAMY BATHROOM. The shower is running and we see the silhouette of two people behind the curtain. 
LLOYD (v.o.) 
OOH... OOH... MARY... 
MARY (v.o.) How does that feel, Lloyd? 
ANDRE I don't like this one goddamn bit, Mental. You and Shay were supposed to grab that bag so we could end this shit. Now I don't know what the hell's going on. 
Andre SIGHS and wipes some perspiration from his upper lip. The Anxious Man KNOCKS on the booth again. 
MENTAL Hold on a second, Mr. Andre... 
Mental puts the phone down and motions the    Anxious Man closer to the booth. The Man moves forward a few    inches. Mental motions him even closer. When he's about a    foot away, Mental punches his hand through the glass of the    booth and knocks the Anxious Man out cold. Then 
Mental picks up the phone again. 
MENTAL (CONT'D) Sorry, boss. You were saying...? 
ANDRE Look, Mental, just find out what they're up to. I want to know who these guys are. 
MENTAL Don't worry. I'm on it. 
Mental hangs up the phone, looks around to make sure he's not being watched, then approaches the parked Mutt Cutt van. He's joined by J.P. Shay. 
As they get within five feet of the vehicle, we hear a LOW GROWL. They stop in their tracks and turn, expecting to see a dog but there isn't one. They both take another step forward, and the GROWL GETS LOUDER AND MEANER. Again, Mental and Shay stop. He peeks under the car. Nothing. 
SHAY What the fuck...? 
Finally, Shay reaches for the door handle. As soon as he touches it, though, the car alarm goes off but instead of a siren, it's the incredibly annoying sound of a POODLE YAPPING. Mental jumps back and pulls his gun. 
MENTAL Where's the goddamn dog? 
Shay shrugs, nervous. The YAPPING grows EVEN LOUDER now, forcing a flustered Shay and Mental to retreat from the scene. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. SWANSON CHALET - ASPEN - NIGHT 
ESTABLISHING SHOT of a luxurious mountainside home. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - SWANSON CHALET 
An agitated Mary Swanson (the young woman who lost her briefcase) is pacing back and forth in 
AN IMPRESSIVE, ANTIQUE-FILLED LIVING ROOM. SEATED ON A COUCH ARE HER FATHER KARL AND HIS MUCH- 
younger second wife, HELEN. 
MARY It just doesn't make any sense. I left the money exactly where they instructed me to. 
HELEN Actually, it makes a great deal of sense, Mary. We should have called in the authorities the moment we knew Melvin had been kidnapped. 
KARL Now, Helen, we've been through this already for Christ's sake, Karl, these bastards will extort us into bankruptcy if we let them. 
MARY But I'd never forgive myself if something happened to Melvin. 
KARL Stop upsetting my daughter, Helen. She's been through quite enough already. MARY It's not her fault, Daddy. We're all a little on edge. 
Just then the living room door opens and the pony tailed Nicholas Andre ENTERS. He looks appropriately solemn. 
ANDRE Has there been any word, Mr. Swanson? 
KARL Nothing yet, Nicholas. 
Andre looks upset. 
ANDRE Perhaps I should call off the Preservation benefit this weekend. 
IT WOULD BE EASY ENOUGH TO RE- 
schedule. 
HELEN No, Nicholas, it's imperative that we carry on as usual. 
The atmosphere in the room couldn't be more somber. Karl Swanson holds his hand out to his aughter. 
KARL Don't worry, sweetheart. I'll do everything they ask. Nothing's going to happen to Melvin, I promise you. 
MARY Thank you, Daddy. 
Karl Swanson looks out the window, concerned. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY 
The black Cadillac pulls over to the side of the road. Joe Mental gets out of the car and props the hood open. He takes out his gun, SLIDES IN A NEW CLIP, and puts it back in his pocket. 
MENTAL (to Shay) Lie down on the front seat. After they pick me up I want you to follow us. Then he folds his arms and the two killers wait for the van to come along. 
CUT TO: 
LLOYD Look, once we drop the briefcase off to Mary, she'll be so grateful she'll plug us right into the party circuit. After that, we do a little of the ski 
SCENE, HOB-NOB WITH THE ELBOW- 
rubbers, and walk out of there in the spring with enough business connections to open a first-class worm operation. You see, you don't get rich working, Harry. You get rich knowing the rich. HARRY Where'd you hear that? 
LLOYD Some bum down at unemployment. 
Harry thinks about this. 
HARRY I don't know, Lloyd. 
LLOYD What's the matter? 
HARRY Money does terrible things to people. I mean, we could lose our friendship. 
Lloyd thinks about this. 
LLOYD Yeah? So? 
Harry nods and looks out the window. Suddenly SOMETHING DAWNS ON LLOYD. 
LLOYD (CONT'D) Hey, wait a second. Hold everything. 
HARRY What? 
LLOYD Aren't you forgetting something? 
Harry thinks about this. 
LLOYD (CONT'D) Back at Mickey D's? A little matter you might've overlooked...? 
Harry wracks his brain, but to no avail. 
HARRY What? 
Lloyd rolls his eyes. 
LLOYD My change. 
As a sheepish Harry gives Lloyd his change, they notice something up ahead. HARRY & LLOYD'S POV - ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, JOE MENTAL IS WAVING THEM 
DOWN AGAIN. This time the Cadillac is PARKED SIDEWAYS ACROSS THE ROAD, 
BLOCKING THEIR PATH. 
HARRY I think this guy's in trouble. Why on't you pull over. 
Lloyd looks at Harry. Harry remembers that he's driving. He pulls the car to the side of the road. Mental approaches the passenger window. 
MENTAL You guys going as far as Des Moines? My car died and I'm late for a business meeting. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - DAY 
They're back on the highway and Joe Mental is SITTING BETWEEN THEM, looking extremely ANNOYED. The guys are in the middle of an argument. 
HARRY It's a fruit. 
LLOYD It's a vegetable. 
HARRY I'm telling you, it's a fruit. 
LLOYD And I happen to know it's a vegetable. 
HARRY Tell you what, why don't we leet an impartial judge decide. 
LLOYD Fine with me. 
Harry turns to Joe Mental. 
HARRY Hey, Mr. Mentalino, settle our bet: Are jelly beans fruits or vegetables? 
Mental grits his teeth as he pops a few antacid pills in his mouth. He reaches into his coat pocket and we see a GLINT OF STEEL. Just when he's about to pull the gun out, though, Lloyd hits the breaks and SKIDS to a stop beside a bunch of hitchhiking MIGRANT WORKERS. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - LATER 
The trio have picked up SIX MIGRANT WORKERS and everyone is crammed into the car including a CRYING BABY who sits on a pissed-off Mental's lap. Someone's playing a FLAMENCO GUITAR and the gang is SINGING a SPANISH SONG. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - LATER STILL 
UP ON A LITTLE TOME THAT WE GOD- 
fearing adults call the Bible. It's crammed with all kinds of pithy rules to live your life by. 
HARRY (humbled) You mean like 'turn the other cheek?' 
LLOYD No, I mean like 'an eye for an eye.' Hand me those peppers the atomic ones. 
Harry passes the jar and the two of them LOAD JOE MENTAL'S BURGER WITH CHILI 
PEPPERS, EXPERTLY CAMOUFLAGING THEM WITH LETTUCE. 
HARRY (whispering) Here he comes. 
Lloyd and Harry bite into their food as Joe Mental sits back down at the table. 
MENTAL Feeling any better, boys? 
As he pours ketchup on his burger, the guys glance at each other and TITTER. Then he picks it up and brings it to his mouth. Just before biting into it, though, he PAUSES. 
MENTAL (CONT'D) So tell me, why you fellas headed to Aspen? Vacation? 
LLOYD More like re-location. 
Mental starts toward the burger but stops again. MENTAL Doesn't look like you packed much. All I saw was a couple bags... and that briefcase. 
HARRY The briefcase isn't even ours. Some lady just left it at the airport. We're bringing it back to her. 
This is news to Mental. 
MENTAL You mean you don't even know her? 
LLOYD Not really. I was just her limo river. 
Mental looks at the two of them and realizes that they're serious. Then he BREAKS OUT 
LAUGHING. 
MENTAL Talk about being in the wrong place at the wrong time... 
Lloyd and Harry share a     confused look. Mental shakes his head and BITES INTO HIS     BURGER, CHEWING HEARTILY. Almost immediately, his happy     demeanor is replaced by a LOOK OF HORROR. His FACE TURNS     RED, HE GRABS HIS STOMACH AND FALLS TO THE 
GROUND, GASPING. 
The boys look at each other guiltily, then bend down to help him. 
HARRY Hey, you okay, man? It was just a goof. 
MENTAL (STRAINED WHISPER) My ulcer... quick... pills... in my coat... 
Harry checks Mental's coat pocket        for his antacid pills but unwittingly brings out the BLACK        OF CYANIDE PILLS. He shakes some pills out and hands them to        Mental, who tosses them in his mouth and starts to MUNCH on        them. 
For a moment, he appears to improve. His BREATHING SLOWS and he sits up. Then his EYES LIGHT UP. 
MENTAL'S POV - QUICK ZOOM IN on the black bottle Harry is holding! 
MENTAL (CONT'D) You son-of-a-bitch! 
Mental GURGLES and keels over, DEAD.

HARRY I can't believe it... 
LLOYD Life is a fragile thing, Har. One minute you're chewing on a burger; the next minute you're dead meat. 
HARRY But he blamed me. You heard him. Those were his last words. 
LLOYD If you don't count that gurgling sound. 
Harry lets out a GROAN. 
LLOYD (CONT'D) Hey, relax, man, I'm just as responsible as you are we both slipped him the peppers and look at me, I on't feel guilty at all. 
HARRY Small comfort coming from a man who sells dead birds to blind kids. (SIGHS) Don't you get it, Lloyd. I've got a ead guy pissed at me. His restless spirit will probably haunt me for the next seventy-five years. 
LLOYD That's ridiculous. You probably won't live to see forty. 
Harry perks up, cheered by this thought. HARRY Oh yeah. (beat) Wow. What a relief.

LLOYD That's a low blow, man. 
HARRY Not at that height it's not. 
LLOYD Listen, bud, if you're trying to imply that I'm that thought look, we're almost in Colorado. 
LLOYD SQUINTS THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD. A SIGN UP AHEAD SAYS: LAST EXIT IN NEBRASKA - 
COLORADO STATE LINE - 3 MILES. 
HARRY I think it's about   time we pull over and change seats.   I've been driving for nine straight   hours I  don't have the energy to   start a new state. 
Lloyd nods, and as he pulls off the exit, we

DT. DALE Any sign of them yet? 
COP No, but we're expecting them shortly. A motorist said he spotted a pooch about thirty miles back headed this way. 
Detective Dale nods, satisfied.

LLOYD Hey, I picked you up a Beef Jerky... 
When he gets no response, he notices that Harry is already fast asleep in the passenger seat. Lloyd shakes his head. 
LLOYD (CONT'D) Boy, some guys just weren't cut out for life on the road. 
EXT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - NIGHT 
Lloyd starts the engine and    pulls out of the parking lot to the nearby freeway entrance.    As he enters the on-ramp, we ZOOM IN on a sign that says:    ROUTE 80 - EAST. He's unwittingly headed BACK IN THE DIRECTION    THEY JUST CAME FROM! 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - SUNNY MORNING 
It's bright daylight now. Harry is sleeping peacefully in the passenger seat while Lloyd sips a coffee. The van hits a bump which causes Harry's eyes to flutter open. 
LLOYD Hey, Mr. Sleepy Head, welcome back. 
HARRY (groggy) How long have I been out? 
LLOYD I'd say a good five hours, anyway. 
Harry yawns and stretches. 
HARRY Great. We must be getting real close, huh? 
LLOYD Should be. I've been averaging about ninety miles an hour all night. 
HARRY Good man. 
LLOYD Boy, I'll tell you, this is one angerous highway. You wouldn't believe all the road pizza two dead ogs, a couple of rabbits, a snake and some big thing I couldn't even recognize. 
HARRY That's awful. Did you see them get hit or were they already lying there? 
LLOYD I hit 'em. 
Harry rubs his eyes and looks at the passing FLATLANDS. 
HARRY Funny. I expected the Rocky Mountains to be a little rockier than this. 
LLOYD I was thinking the same thing. That John Denver's some full of shit, huh? 
HARRY Where'd you find this baby? 
LLOYD Used car dealer. I   traded the van for it. Plus I got   the guy to throw in fifty bucks for   gas money. (beat) Come on, man, what   do you say? We still partners? 
HARRY SMILES AND WE 
CUT TO: 
EXT. COLORADO STATE LINE - DAY 
An impatient Detective Dale is still staked-out at the Colorado border with several other officers. 
DT. DALE It doesn't make sense. They should've been here hours ago. 
COP Maybe they're smarter than we thought. 
DT. DALE How smart can they be? They're riving a goddamn dog! 
Another COP rushes over holding his walkie-talkie. 
COP #2 We just got a report that they were spotted about two hours ago heading east near Des Moines on I-80. 
DT. DALE (incredulous) Des Moines?! Why that's five hundred miles from here! 
COP #1 Guess they got wind of our welcoming party. 
DT. DALE We're wasting time. Let's mobilize. 
Dt. Dale heads for his cruiser while the other Cops follow. As the officers climb into their cars, we 
CUT TO: 
INT. HEARSE - DAY 
Lloyd is driving and Harry has his feet out the window. 
LLOYD Tell me something, Harry. Would you really have kept going home if I hadn't come back to get you? 
HARRY Well let me put it this way, Lloyd: Do you remember when we were Cub Scouts and we got lost in the woods uring that blizzard? We huddled together all night, and we made an oath that if we ever got out of there alive we'd never ever leave each other's side again. Do you remember that? 
Lloyd thinks hard about this. 
LLOYD We were never Cub Scouts. 
HARRY Exactly. 
Just then several COP CARS whiz by them in the opposite direction with SIRENS BLARING and LIGHTS FLASHING. When Harry glances back at the cop cars, he notices that there's a COFFIN in the rear of the vehicle. 
HARRY (CONT'D) What the hell is this? There's a coffin in the back! 
LLOYD Relax, it's empty. 
HARRY I don't give a shit. I'm not driving anywhere with a casket. You know I'm superstitious calm down. We'll dump it off first chance we get. 
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY 
Harry and Lloyd are swerving through traffic in the hearse. Ahead of them is a REAL FUNERAL PROCESSION. The lead car is a CADILLAC. 
INT. CADILLAC (LEAD CAR) - DAY 
(This is the car right behind the funeral hearse.) A MAN and a WOMAN are arguing. 
WOMAN I married a cheapskate. 
MAN Shut your trap, Gerdie. 
WOMAN I'm so embarrassed. I'll never be able to show my face again. 
MAN I knew something good would come out of this. 
WOMAN We could have given him a more ignified burial. 
MAN Your uncle was a cheap man. Remember what he got us for our twenty-fifth? A friggin' fern. There's no way I'm gonna spend a load to get him planted. 
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY 
While the couple ARGUES ON, Harry and Lloyd cut in front of them. The Man and the Woman on't notice this an soon the ENTIRE FUNERAL PROCESSION IS UNWITTINGLY 
FOLLOWING THE WRONG HEARSE. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. PIGGLY WIGGLY SUPERMARKET - DAY 
Harry and Lloyd pull up to a large green dumpster behind the market. The procession comes to a halt behind them. The guys get out of the hearse and remove the coffin from the back. Then they unceremoniously HEAVE THE COFFIN INTO THE DUMPSTER AND WIPE THEIR HANDS 
LLOYD Right here the A/C button. I put it on full blast about an hour ago and, if anything, the car's getting colder. 
Harry stares at Lloyd and then throws down his cup, disgusted. He opens the car door and starts to climb out. 
LLOYD (CONT'D) What are you going out there for? 
HARRY To warm up. 
EXT. HEARSE - NIGHT Harry gets out and leans against the car with his arms crossed. Lloyd comes from around the other side. 
LLOYD What are you worrying about now? 
HARRY I'm worried about how you're gonna survive the pummeling I'm about to give you. 
LLOYD Huh? 
Suddenly Harry LUNGES at Lloyd, who takes off around the other side of the car. Harry leaps across the hood, but Lloyd manages to evade his grasp. 
LLOYD (CONT'D) Harry, calm down! You're acting like a wild animal! 
HARRY Get over here and take your medicine, Lloyd! 
LLOYD Sorry, doc, I can't take medicine. I'm a Christian Scientist! 
Lloyd continues to outrun him around the car. Frustrated, Harry opens the car and PULLS THE 
BRIEFCASE OUT. 
LLOYD (CONT'D) What are you doing? 
HARRY Something I should've done a long time ago. This stupid thing has been the root of our problems all along. 
Harry starts walking toward the bridge spanning a river. 
LLOYD Don't do anything foolish, Harry. 
HARRY Foolish? This is the most sensible thing I've done in years. I'm gonna toss this goddamn curse right into that river. Lloyd starts to follow after Harry. 
LLOYD You're making a big mistake, Harry! I'll never forgive you for this! 
Harry keeps marching toward the bridge, determined to dispose of the briefcase. 
LLOYD (CONT'D) Harry, hold up! Things are gonna get better, I promise! In fact, I think 
I feel another piece of Beef Jerky in my left molar! It's yours, Harry, all yours! 
Harry stops in his tracks, intrigued. 
HARRY You're bluffing. 
LLOYD No I'm not, man look. 
Lloyd pulls his cheek back, revealing a molar. Harry squints at it. 
HARRY That's a filling, you liar! 
Just then, Lloyd makes a dash at Harry. Harry turns and runs, but Lloyd TACKLES HIM as they reach the bridge. The briefcase GOES FLYING, and the guys wrestle pitifully with one another in the snow, rolling over and over. 
Finally, Harry manages to get the upper hand. He climbs on top and CLASPS HIS HANDS 
AROUND LLOYD'S THROAT. 
HARRY (CONT'D) I used to have a life! A miserable one, but a life, nonetheless! 
Suddenly Lloyd's EYES LIGHT UP as he sees something O.S. behind his friend. 
LLOYD (CHOKED VOICE) Harry, look! 
Harry turns and HIS EYES LIGHT UP, TOO. He lets go of Lloyd as we see THEIR POV - THE BRIEFCASE IS LYING BUSTED OPEN ON THE GROUND, REVEALING STACKS AND 
STACKS OF BIG, BEAUTIFUL HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS! 
CUT TO: 
EXT. DOWNTOWN ASPEN - NIGHT 
Harry and Lloyd are hurrying down the sidewalk, clutching the briefcase. The city is lit up with millions of tiny lights, like a fantasy winter wonderland. 
LLOYD Okay, here's the plan: We borrow a few bucks just a small loan from the briefcase, and we check into a cheap motel. 
HARRY Sounds good. 
LLOYD And we'll keep track of the money we spend with IOUs. 
HARRY We'll be meticulous    right down to the last penny. 
J.P. SHAY (WHISPERING) Jesus Christ, boss... it's them. 
BACK ON HARRY AND LLOYD - the guys make their way through the affluent crowd. 
LLOYD I'm getting nervous, Harry. 
HARRY relax, Lloyd. These people are just like you and me. 
LLOYD What are you talking about? They're educated, well-bred, charming, and sophisticated. 
HARRY So what? We can be sophistica holy shit, would you look at the fun bags on that hose hound. 
He points out a busty BLONDE BOMBSHELL entering the party. Lloyd rolls his eyes. 
LLOYD Don't do this to me, Harry. I'm already a wreck. What if Mary oesn't like me? 
HARRY Look, let's just go saddle up to the bar and down a couple bowls of loudmouth soup. A little booze'll bring back that old Lloyd Christmas over-confidence. 
The guys stand out at the glittering social scene as they make their way to the bar. 
LLOYD (to BARTENDER) Two martinis, straight up. As Harry and Lloyd silently take in the party, a BEAUTIFUL RED HEAD reaches between them for a cocktail napkin, then walks away. 
LLOYD (CONT'D) Shut up, Harry. 
HARRY I didn't say anything. 
LLOYD Yeah, well I know what you were gonna say and I'm telling you to shut up in advance. 
HARRY How do you know what I was gonna say? 
LLOYD I read you like a book. 
HARRY Okay, if you read me like a book then what was I gonna say? 
LLOYD You were gonna say: (in Harry's looped VOICE) 'That's one fiery bush I wouldn't mind roasting my weenie in.' 
Harry raises his eyebrows, IMPRESSED. 
LLOYD (CONT'D) And I would say 'shut up', because this is our chance to get in with the rich and powerful and you don't ingratiate yourself to the kind of people by acting like Ron Jeremy on Spanish Fly. 
The Bartender delivers their martinis as we hear the o.s. CLINKING of a glass. The guys turns to 
see Nicholas Andre standing at a podium. Next to him is a LARGE, COVERED DISPLAY. On his other side are Karl and Elizabeth Swanson. 
ANDRE If I could have your attention, please... 
The crowd QUIETS. ANDRE (CONT'D) I'd like to thank you all for coming to this very special event. As you 
KNOW, THE ASPEN PRESERVATION SOCIETY - 
founded and chiefly funded by our great benefactors, Karl and Helen Swanson - is the world's foremost efender of endangered species. Our 
SPRAWLING GROUNDS ARE HOME TO TWENTY- 
three separate varieties of animals that are currently listed on the United Nation's charter of protected species. Tonight, we are deeply honored to have Mr. Karl Swanson welcome our twenty-fourth. 
The crowd CLAPS as Mr. Swanson takes Andre's place at the podium. 
MR. SWANSON Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the Icelandic Snow Owl. 
He pulls the cover off, revealing TWO MAJESTIC, FLUFFY WHITE OWLS IN A CAGE. Everyone OOHS and AHHS. 
MR. SWANSON (CONT'D) These magnificent specimens were 
RESCUED RECENTLY, CULMINATING A FIVE- 
year, two-million-dollar effort on our part. Together, they constitute one-seventh of the snow owl population left on the planet. 
ON ANDRE - he's nervously eyeing Harry and Lloyd. He looks pale. 
MR. SWANSON Here these lovely birds will be allowed to breed in a natural but protected habitat. And, God willing, with your help and that of the Society's, we will see these wonderful creatures flourish once more. 
More APPLAUSE. 
MR. SWANSON (CONT'D) Again, thank you, and enjoy your evening. Oh, and feel free to take a closer look at our new friends here. Enjoy. 
The crowd APPLAUDS and begins to mingle again. Lloyd turns back to the Bartender and holds up his empty glass. 
LLOYD Two more, please. 
Harry stares at Lloyd with concern. 
HARRY Lloyd, I've never seen you this uptight. You've gotta chill out. 
LLOYD I can't help it. This is a very important night for me. (MORE) 
HARRY Harry Dunne. Pleasure meeting you both. 
HELEN I saw you come in earlier, Mr. Dunne. I was hoping we'd get a chance to meet. 
HARRY (taken aback) You were? 
HELEN That tuxedo I love a man with a sense of humor. So does Mary. 
Mary shoots Helen a look, then smiles at Harry. 
HARRY Really? 
For a moment, he's caught up in Mary's eyes, but then manages to snap out of it. 
HARRY (CONT'D) Anyway, about my friend you doing anything tomorrow, Mr. Dunne? Because I believe Mary's looking for somebody to hit the slopes with. Whuh? 
MARY Helen, you're embarrassing me. 
HELEN Well you are, aren't you? (to Harry) Poor girl doesn't get out enough. So what do you say, Harry? Are you available? 
Harry thinks about this, then looks across the room at a hopeful Lloyd. 
HARRY Oh, I don't know. You see, my friend your friends for one day. You and Mary will have a ball. 
Mary's captivating eyes meet his, waiting for an answer. 
HARRY (CONT'D) Um... well... I don't know. You see, the thing is... sure. 
ON LLOYD - he waits impatiently at the bar as Harry returns. 
LLOYD How come you didn't call me over? 
HARRY Relax, you're golden. I got you a ate with her tomorrow. 
Lloyd falls back against the bar and grabs his chest. He's SPEECHLESS. 
LLOYD Wha... you... I... it's... (smiles) I love you, man. I love you! 
Lloyd clamps an embarrassed Harry in a TIGHT EMBRACE. 
HARRY Okay, get a grip, Lloyd. You're making a scene. 
Lloyd steps back elated. 
LLOYD This calls for a toast! 
He grabs a bottle of champagne out of a bucket and starts to open it. 
LLOYD (CONT'D) You're gonna be my best man, Har, I mean it. It was always between you and my future wife's brother, but you just earned a seat at the head table, pal. 
Suddenly the CORK SHOOTS OUT OF THE CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE AND ZIPS ACROSS 
THE ROOM LIKE A BULLET   DIRECTLY TOWARD ONE OF THE NOW EVEN WIDER- 
EYED OWLS. In quick succession we hear a BOK!, a SQUAWK!, and a THUMP! 
A HUSH falls over the entire party as everyone turns their stunned attention to the cage. 
THEIR POV - FEATHERS ARE FLOATING IN THE AIR THROUGHOUT THE CAGE, AND ONE OF THE ICELANDIC SNOW 
Owls LIES ON ITS BACK, its species now one bird closer to extinction. 
Harry and Lloyd look on in horror. Harry takes the smoking champagne bottle from Lloyd and places it on the bar. 
HARRY (under breath) I think we've done enough hobnobbing, Lloyd. 
The guys LOWER THEIR HEADS and slink out of the room before anyone can figure out what happened anyone except for Nicholas Andre, that is; we PAN to show that he's been standing nearby watching their every move. And he doesn't look very happy. 
CUT TO: 
INT. AASPEN APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Nicholas Andre is pacing the room with a drink in his hand while J.P. Shay looks on nervously. 
J.P. SHAY Maybe it was just a coincidence. 
ANDRE Don't be stupid. It's a message, plain and simple: We killed their bird, now they killed ours. 
J.P. SHAY But how could anybody off a bird with a cork? 
ANDRE These guys arent' just anybody. They're good. Look what they did to Mental. He was the best, and yet he fell right into their web. 
J.P. SHAY But the bastards already got our money. What the hell more could they want? 
Andre runs his fingers through his hair. 
HARRY Why not? 
MARY (evasive) There's been... family problems. I on't want to bore you with them. 
HARRY Thanks. 
He looks mindlessly off in the distance. Then Harry notices a PATCH OF FROST on the chair lift bar. 
HARRY (CONT'D) Oh, look... frost. 
He licks it and his TONGUE IMMEDIATELY FUSES WITH THE FROZEN METAL. He tugs a few times, but it won't budge. 
MARY Are you okay? 
HARRY (lisping) Sure. I do this all the time... CUT TO: 
EXT. MOUNTAIN TOP - DAY 
As Mary and Harry arrive at the top of the lift, Mary disembarks but Harry stays on. 
HARRY (lisping) See ya at the bottom... 
Harry and the chair lift swing around and start heading down the hill. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. BOTTOM OF MOUNTAIN - DAY 
The chair lift comes back around with Harry still sitting on it, stuck to the bar. Two LITTLE KIDS climb on with him. 
HARRY (lisping) Hi. (off their looks) Say, kids, you wouldn't happen to have a cup of warm water, would you? 
The two kids just stare at him. 
CUT TO: 
INT. AVALANCHE BAR & GRILL - AFTERNOON 
A despondent   Lloyd's got a couple of empties in front of him now. The bar   is open and there are a few CUSTOMERS sprinkled about. Lloyd   takes a sip of his drink and looks up at the clock on the   wall. It's 12:30. 
We see a pair of beautiful legs slide onto the stool next to him. PAN OVER to reveal that it's the Athletic Beauty that Harry had tried to pick up at the truck stop. 
ATHLETIC BEAUTY Hi. 
Lloyd GRUNTS a hello. 
ATHLETIC BEAUTY (CONT'D) Bad day, huh? 
Lloyd GRUNTS once more. ATHLETIC BEAUTY (CONT'D) (big smile) well don't worry, Mercury's supposed to be coming out or retrograde tonight. Things will get better. 
AS LLOYD GRUNTS AGAIN, WE 
CUT TO: 
EXT. BASE LODGE - AFTERNOON 
Mary gracefully carves her way to the bottom of the hill and stops with a snow-spraying flourish. She looks around the outdoor patio for Harry. She spots something and does a DOUBLE- TAKE. 
MARY'S POV - HARRY IS SITTING AT A TABLE, STILL ATTACHED TO THE CHAIR LIFT (WHICH 
has been removed from the cable). He's drinking a cup of coffee and trying to act nonchalant, espite the gawking of the other SKIERS. There's a MIME performing in the b.g. 
BACK TO SCENE 
MARY My god. Harry, are you okay? 
HARRY (lisping) I'm fine, I'm fine. It'll come off. 
CUT TO: 
CLOSE UP of Harry's head through a RIFLE SCOPE. REVERSE ANGLE to reveal J.P. Shay a few hundred feet up the hill with a high-powered rifle trained on Harry. 
SHAY You're luck just ran out, pal. 
As his trigger finger TWITCHES with anticipation, we go 
BACK TO SCENE 
MARY This is silly. Let me help you... 
Mary gets up and stands behind Harry. He MOANS nervously. She grabs his head in both hands and starts pulling it away from the bar. We see HARRY'S TONGUE STRETCH RIDICULOUSLY... FIVE INCHES... SIX... THEN EIGHT. Harry GROANS in pain. Suddenly, his TONGUE COMES UNDONE and Harry and Mary fall backwards out of the path of J.P. Shay's bullet as it WHIZZES BY. We hear the Mime in the b.g. CRY OUT in pain: 
MIME GODDAMN IT! WHAT THE FUCK?! 
The poor Mime holds his bleeding hand and retreats nervously into the lodge as the CROWD BOOS him. 
HARRY (o.s.) Sure thing, pal. Whatever you think will help your chances. 
Lloyd BITES HIS LIP at this. He fills two mugs with coffee and throws a splash of Bailey's in each. He check to make sure Harry is still in the closet, then pulls out a BOX OF EX-LAX. 
LLOYD DUMPS THE ENTIRE PACK INTO ONE MUG AND MIXES IT IN. 
WHEN HARRY COMES OUT OF THE CLOSET DRESSED IN A NEW SUIT AND TIE, LLOYD DOES A DOUBLE- 
take. 
LLOYD Pretty snazzed out for a movie, aren't you? 
HARRY Uh... it's for mature audiences. I on't wanna chance getting turned away at the door. 
LLOYD I see. 
Lloyd hands him the mug with the Ex-Lax. Then he lifts his own glass. 
LLOYD (CONT'D) To my friend Harry the matchmaker. 
Harry feels a pang of guilt but drinks up anyway. HARRY Mmmmm... 
He GULPS DOWN THE DRINK. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HEARSE - NIGHT 
Harry's driving along, WHISTLING happily to himself in anticipation of the night. Suddenly we hear a LOW, INTESTINAL RUMBLE. He reacts and rubs his stomach. 
EXT. SWANSON CHALET - NIGHT 
The hearse parks on the street and Harry gets out. He's walking up the steps to the house when we hear more GASEOUS THUNDER from his stomach. Harry stops in his tracks, gets his insides under control, and continues to the front porch, where he RINGS the bell. 
Mary answers the door, fiddling with her earrings. 
MARY Hi. Come on in. 
INT. SWANSON CHALET 
Harry follows her inside. 
MARY Make yourself at home. I'm almost ready. Just give me one more minute. 
As she disappears down a hallway, we hear Harry's UPSET STOMACH again. He notices a bathroom off the hallway and rushes inside. 
INT. BATHROOM 
HOLD ON Harry's face as he quickly pulls his pants down and nestles onto the throne. He lets out a SIGH OF RELIEF as he does his business, then leans over and SLIDES OPEN THE WINDOW to air the room out. He's still glued to the toilet when he hears a KNOCK on the door. 
MARY (o.s.) Are you in there, Harry? HARRY (nervously) Be right out. 
MARY (o.s.) I hope you're not using the toilet. It's broken. 
ZOOM IN TIGHT on Harry's face - his EYES GO WIDE and a visible SWEAT breaks out on his forehead. 
HARRY Huh? 
MARY (o.s.) It doesn't flush. 
HARRY Um, no, I was just... shaving. 
EXT. HALLWAY 
A confused Mary is standing outside the bathroom door. 
MARY Shaving? 
HARRY (o.s.) Yeah! I was running a little late. Thought this would save time. 
MARY Okay. Well I'll be in the living room whenever you're ready. 
INT. BATHROOM 
Harry's got his pants back on and is lifting the lid off the toilet tank. He starts tinkering with a few valves. 
HARRY (under breath) Come on, flush, you bastard... 
EXT. LIVING ROOM - SWANSON CHALET - NIGHT 
Mary's sitting patiently on the couch with her legs crossed. She looks at her watch, then flips on the TV. ON THE TUBE - the news is on. A WOMAN REPORTER is addressing the CAMERA gravely: 
REPORTER We'll be back in a minute with the story of the blind Indiana boy who was duped into buying a dead parakeet. 
We see Billy the blind boy from apartment 4-C sitting in his wheelchair, holding up Petey the parakeet with its head Scotch taped on its body. 
She can't believe her ears. 
MARY That is the sweetest thing I've ever heard. 
He drops his head and Mary leans over and kisses him on the cheek. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HEARSE - NIGHT 
A sullen Harry is driving back to the hotel. 
HARRY (MUMBLING to himself) It's all Kharma, Harry. You screw your best friend over and it's gonna come back to haunt you, plain and simple... 
CUT TO: 
INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE 
CLOSE ON LLOYD'S FACE - he's starry-eyed in love as he spills his guts. 
LLOYD Look, Mary, I know this may seem a little sudden but I've given it a lot of thought: You're the woman I've been waiting for my whole life, and I'm not ashamed to admit it -- (holds up his hand) --Please, let me finish. (DEEP BREATH) I'm crazy about you. I've never felt this way about anyone. You make it so easy for me to tell you my innermost desires. (NERVOUS LAUGH) Listen to me, I feel like a schoolboy again. (beat) A schoolboy who desperately wants to make sweet, sweet love to you. 
Suddenly we hear   TOILET FLUSHING O.S. 
REVERSE ANGLE REVEALS that Lloyd has been talking to an EMPTY CHAIR. The bathroom oor opens and Mary comes out. She looks around, expecting to see someone else. 
MARY Oh... I thought I heard you talking to someone. 
Lloyd is flustered. He swallows hard. It's the moment of truth. 
LLOYD Mary... (BLURTING OUT) I desperately want to make love to a schoolboy. 
MARY (taken aback) Maybe I should be going now. 
LLOYD No, that's not what Imeant. I meant... I really like you, Mary. I like you a lot. 
She smiles at this. 
LLOYD (CONT'D) I'm gonna ask you something flat out and I want you to answer me honestly: What do you think the chances are of a girl like you and a guy like me ending up together? 
Mary is obviously thrown by this question. 
MARY Lloyd, that's difficult to say. I 
mean we hardly -- 
LLOYD --I asked you to be honest, Mary. MARY But Lloyd, I really can't -- 
LLOYD --Come    on, give it to me straight. I rove a    long way to see you, the least you can    do is level with me. What are my    chances? 
MARY Not good. 
BEAT 
LLOYD You mean not good, like one out of a hundred? 
MARY I'd say more like one out of a million. 
BEAT 
LLOYD (Duh) So you're telling me there's a chance? 
Just then, there's a KNOCK at the door. When Lloyd opens it, he's face to face with Nicholas Andre. 
MARY Nicholas... what are you doing here? 
ANDRE I've been looking for you, Mary. 
I've got some interesting news about your husband. 
Lloyd looks at MAry, devastated. 
LLOYD Husband? 
ANDRE Aren't you two going to invite me in? 
Lloyd and Mary hear a CLICK and turn to see Andre POINTING A GUN at them. Andre steps into the room, and we 
CUT TO: 
INT. HOTEL DANBURY - LOBBY - NIGHT As Harry mopes through the lobby, we hear someone CALL OUT: 
WOMAN'S VOICE (o.s.) Hey! 
Harry turns to see the Athletic Beauty approaching. 
Lloyd can't muster a defense. LLOYD Look... I was gonna tell you about that. It was gonna be mentioned at the reading of my will. I swear, you can ask my lawyer. 
Harry glares at him. 
HARRY Well I guess we both learned a little something about each other, didn't we? 
LLOYD You said it, pal. Maybe we're not as good friends as we thought we were. 
HARRY Guess not. 
LLOYD I mean, if one beautiful girl   could rip us apart like this, then   it seems our friendship isn't worth a   damn. (beat) Maybe we should call it quits   right here. 
HARRY Just tell me where to sign, bud. 
Suddenly they hear the metallic CLICK-CLACK OF A GUN BEING COCKED. 
ANDRE Okay, which one of you losers wants to die first? 
The guys exchange a look and SWALLOW HARD. 
HARRY I wouldn't pull that trigger if I were you. 
ANDRE Why not? It'll look like just another Aspen love triangle. You caught the two of them in bed, handcuffed them to the post, murdered them, and killed yourself. 
HARRY (smug) Except you're forgetting one minor etail. 
ANDRE What's that? 
Lloyd and Mary look at Harry, hopeful. 
HARRY If you kill us, you'd be killing yourself. 
ANDRE (puzzled) Huh? 
HARRY You see, philosophers believe that we're all really just tiny pieces of one huge universal being. In other words, I am you and you are me, so if you were to kill us you'd be committing suicide, you unenlightened 
idiot -- 
ANDRE --Shut up! 
Mary sees that they're in deep shit now. 
MARY What about my husband? Did you kill him, too? 
HARRY Husband? What husband? 
LLOYD Mary's married, Harry. 
ANDRE No need to worry about Melvin. (beat) Now this is the last time I'll ask: Who wants to die first? 
Harry gestures with his head at Mary. 
HARRY Kill her. The bitch should've told him she was married back at the airport. It would've saved us a lot of trouble. 
Andre points the gun at Mary. 
LLOYD No, I'll go first, Harry. I was the one who got you into this mess. 
Andre points the gun at Lloyd. 
HARRY No, wait, do me first. I'm the one who stole your girl, Lloyd. I eserve it. 
Andre SIGHS and points the gun at Harry. Then, as Mary and Lloyd look on in horror, he FIRES TWICE. Harry grabs his stomach and falls off the bed to the floor. 
LLOYD Jesus Christ! You killed my best friend, you bastard! 
Andre smiles. 
ANDRE If it's any consolation, you're about to be reunited. 
He aims the gun at Lloyd, COCKS THE TRIGGER. Suddenly, a SHOT RINGS OUT and the gun is blown out of Andre's hand. 
ON THE FLOOR - Harry is very much alive and pointing a pistol at the stunned Nicholas Andre. 
LLOYD Harry! You're alive! 
Just them, the door BURSTS OPEN and SEVERAL POLICE OFFICERS storm in with their weapons drawn. 
COP #1 Get your hands up, asshole! 
Lloyd and Harry throw their hands into the air. A stunned Andre turns to see six guns pointing at his head. He reluctantly raises his hands. Mary and Lloyd are flabbergasted by the turn of events. 
There's a sudden commotion in the room. Pushing her way through the mass of cops comes the Athletic Beauty. She flashes an ID. 
ATHLETIC BEAUTY Special Officer Kathryn Frick. Federal Bureau of Investigation.

1   EXT. RODEO STADIUM - DALLAS - TEXAS - DAY                        1 
Ambient sounds of the CROWD, RODEO, SEX, and a strange RINGING fade in along with IMAGES of... 
A COWBOY riding a BULL in an enclosed RODEO ring. 
RON WOODROOF, early 40's, handsome, long sandy hair, denim clad, worn snakeskin boots, dusty, cowboy hat, mirrored aviators, is engaged in wild SEX with a WOMAN. He watches the rodeo through open slats in a BULL STALL as the STEER throws the COWBOY violently thru the air; he lands hard on the dirt. Another WOMAN snorts cocaine and offers some to Ron as he switches over to having SEX with her. 
The BULL STOMPS the Cowboy with its HOOFS. 
Ron climaxes -- pleasure and pain seem to come out of him, but we can't hear him, only this strange RINGING. 
RODEO CLOWNS grab the Cowboy's limp body and drag him out of the ring. 
Ron catches his breath; something is off. 
RON (V.O.) Did ya hear Rock Hudson was a cock sucker? 
2   EXT. RODEO STADIUM - LOCKER ROOM - DAY                           2 
A Dallas NEWSPAPER folded in half. July. 1985.      AIDS. New treatment. In Paris. ROCK HUDSON on the cover.      A HAND scribbles numbers over the photo. 
CLINT (V.O.) Where'd ya hear that? 
CLINT (32) a greasy hick who's spent the last five months under the hood of a CHEVY, hands RON a WAD of CASH. 
RON It's called a newspaper.     You heard of it? 
Ron smiles, adjusts his cowboy hat as he records some bets. Nearby, BULL FIGHTERS are putting on their clown makeup. 
RON What a waste. All that fine Hollywood pussy on a guy who smokes his friends. 
A HAND comes down through the slats holding a ten dollar bill. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 2 
RON C'mon Rog, this ain't the sandbox. Twenty's the minimum. 
ROG slides another ten down; Ron snatches it. 
ROG Who the hell's Rock Hudson? 
Ron looks at Rog.   A beat, then he starts laughing, then coughing... 
3   EXT. RODEO STADIUM - BULL STALL - DAY                            3 
...and coughing as we follow him into the stalls. Ron glad- hands as he goes; it seems everyone knows him but doesn't necessarily like him. He makes his way toward T.J., white trash, pale as winter, who wipes vomit from his chin. As he nervously looks down at the big angry BULL he's about to ride, Ron hands him a pint of tequila. 
RON Calm the nerves, brother.     You look great. 
T.J. takes a swig, gives him a look. 
RON It's your day, I can feel it. 
T.J. watches as Ron takes a bottle of NYQUIL out of his pocket and downs it... to stop his hacking cough. 
T.J. I don't know, Ron. 
Ron fans the money out for T.J. to see. 
RON Eight seconds and you'll be gettin blown by a hundred dollar hooker before you can scrape the bullshit off your boots. 
Ron winks and smiles. T.J. signals the BULLMAN that he's ready. And in five, four, three, two, one... 
THE GATE is up, the BULL is out, the crowd is HOLLERING and T.J.'s back is bending in unnatural ways. 
Books, newspapers, empty beer cans and liquor bottles; on the wall, we may notice a painting of some Texas Wildflowers. Ron stumbles in as the RINGING sound comes back. He stops, steadies himself on a piece of furniture, takes a few steps then collapses, unconscious. 
8   INT. RON'S TRAILER - MORNING                                     8 
The first shafts of sunlight fall over Ron, still asleep where he dropped. After a few beats, he stirs, pulls himself on to a chair. "What the fuck?". 
9   EXT. OIL FIELD - DAY                                             9 
Lunch time. Already a little drunk, Ron finishes off a pint of whiskey as Clint and a battered T.J. eat sandwiches nearby. Ron starts coughing again as he grabs a packet of cocaine out of his shirt pocket. He slides it across the table to Clint who hands him cash. 
RON That shit is purer than a preacher daughter's pussy. 
CLINT Not after you just coughed your lungs all over it. 
T.J. You think anymore 'bout Saudi Arabia? They need guys over there. 
RON What do you wanna go work for a buncha sand niggas for? 
T.J. They pay five times as much, that's why. 
Ron raises his eyebrows, not bad. 
T.J. I'm signing up. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 6 
RON They got hot ladies over there? 
T.J. It's a Muslim country.    You can't fuck the women. 
RON Now that takes me out right there. 
The FOREMAN races over to them. 
FOREMAN Woodroof, there's been an accident on platform five. They need an electrician right away! 
10   EXT. DRILL PLATFORM - DAY - LATER                                10 
A MEXICAN WORKER has his leg caught in the drill. It's severed and he's losing blood fast. Ron walks over. 
RON Dumb spic.     How'd you get your leg in there? 
The guy's breath is coming in short fast spurts. 
RON Where's the ambulance? 
FOREMAN He's illegal. 
Ron takes his OWN shirt off, rips it in half, kneels down next to the MEXICAN, wipes some sweat off his brow and ties a makeshift tourniquet around his leg. 
Ron looks to the Foremen. 
RON Go call `em. (the FOREMEN doesn't move) Go FUCKING call `em. 
He walks off to call.    Ron turns back to the Mexican. 
RON Alright we're going to get you outta there but you gotta stay still until I say get the fuck out and then you get the fuck out. Comprende? Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 7 
The guy nods. Ron walks over to the electrician's box. He's a little DRUNK. He grabs a wire and is about to cut it. 
RON (CONT'D) Alright, on the count of three.   One, two... 
Ron cuts the wire, an electrical spark shoots out and before he can move back the box blows up in his face. Everything goes black. 
RICK FERRIS (V.O.) Azidothymidine, or AZT -- was originally developed as a treatment for cancer. 
11   INT. DALLAS MERCY HOSPITAL - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY             11 
Barrow Wilkem rep RICK FERRIS, slick, well-dressed, gold Rolex, 40s, stands before DR. NATHAN SEVARD, 50's, arrogant, DR. EVE SAKS, early 30s, sophisticated, and five other PHYSICIANS, 40s-60s, all members of the hospital board. 
RICK FERRIS With the onset of HIV, however, we at Barrow Wilkem began a trial in which we administered AZT to infected lab animals. Initial findings suggested increased CD4 counts, restored T-cell immunity and also evidence of inducing weight gain. 
SEVARD Isn't it also true that it had some concerning side effects in animal tests, significantly decreasing the animals red and white blood cells? 
DR. SEVARD Your T-cell count is down to nine, a healthy person has five hundred to fifteen hundred. 
RON What the fuck's a three-Cell?! 
DR. SEVARD T-cell.   Frankly we're surprised you're alive. 
RON Well surprise this: you've made a fuckin' mistake! 
Ron looks back and forth from Dr. Saks to Sevard.    No mistake. 
RON You must've mixed my blood with some daisy puller or sumptin. 
EVE We ran the blood test several times. 
Eve hands him some pamphlets and other paper work. 
EVE That's some information on HIV and AIDS you may find informative and your test results. 
Ron flips through the papers. Becomes frustrated by terminology he doesn't understand. 
DR. SEVARD Mr. Woodroof, we're trying to impress upon you the gravity of your situation. (MORE) Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 11 
DR. SEVARD (CONT'D) Based on your condition, we estimate that you have about thirty days to get your affairs in order -- 
RON Thirty days? 
Ron jumps off the examining table. 
RON What is this shit?! 
They don't respond. 
Ron laughs incredulously and walks towards the door. 
RON I got a news flash for all y'all, there ain't nothin' out there that can kill Ron Woodroof in thirty days. 
Ron looks at the papers, tosses them up in the air and exits. 
14   INT. RON'S TRAILER - NIGHT                                       14 
Music BLARES as Ron and T.J. party with two hot girls, KELLY and CRYSTAL, 20s. T.J. cuts a line of coke on a mirror while Ron dances over to the girls with SHOTS of Jack Daniels. They both start kissing, then rubbing up against Ron. 
15   INT. RON'S TRAILER - NIGHT                                       15 
T.J. is having sex with Kelly as Ron kisses Crystal; he leans down, snorts what is probably his fiftieth line of coke. He shakes it off, slams some Jack Daniels from the bottle as if it was Kool Aid. He's obliterated. 
As Ron stares off at something, T.J. waves at Crystal to join him and Kelly; as she does, we see what Ron is staring at -- a CALENDAR. 
But its days have no numbers. Except one, in blood RED -- 30. Ron snaps out of his hallucination. 
16   INT. RON'S TRAILER - NIGHT                                       16 
T.J. sits down next to Ron, takes a rolled up dollar bill and does a line of coke. 
T.J. Damn doctors cut your balls off? Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 12 
RON Shit, you tell `em you got a cold and they'll give you two weeks off. You should try it. 
Ron takes the dollar back as T.J. walks to the table to pour himself a drink. 
T.J. Well, you didn't miss nothin' at work. I'd take disability any day. 
Ron does a line of coke.   Sees his reflection in the mirror. Pushes it away. 
RON I mean I got a stupid cough and they tell me I got some HIV virus. 
T.J. looks at Ron, hears him but doesn't hear him, maybe it doesn't even register he's so wasted. 
RON (mutters) Hell, like I got the AIDS. Damn hospital, mixed up my blood samples. 
T.J. Man, I went to them doctors once, they tell me I had chlamydia, I came back home I realized I had crabs. 
EFFEMINATE MAN Is it true you can get it in Mexico?! 
AUDIENCE MEMBER #2 (O.C.) What about dextran sulfate?! 
As the chaos and shouting continues, Ron walks out in frustration and we're suddenly-- 
24   INT. STRIP CLUB - NIGHT                                         24 
CLOSE ON -- a line of flickering CANDLES. 
That's Ron's POV as he grimaces, despair in his eyes. He doesn't look at the moving, out-of-focus SILHOUETTES in front of him. 
RON (mumbles to himself) I need to slow it down a second, catch my breath. I'm not ready to crawl into a corner. You hear that? I'm not fucking ready. Man, if you're up there you better be listening. (MORE) Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 19A 
RON (CONT'D) And if there's a chance, if I got one fucking chance, send me a sign. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 20 
Ron downs a shooter and grimaces again. He slams the glass down on a table among empty glasses and looks up at the candles on a stage in front of a STRIPPER, lost in his thoughts. Then he looks up and sees something across the room, past the stripper. She tries to get his attention. 
STRIPPER If you're not gonna look or buy a dance, you could at least tip me. 
Ron stands and throws some bills on the stage. 
RON I'll take a dance, but not fer me. Just shake it, he'll see you. 
Ron looks heavenward. 
RON Thanks. 
And he walks off towards a man at the end of the bar: the Hispanic Orderly from the hospital. 
25   EXT. DALLAS MERCY HOSPITAL - REAR - NIGHT                     25 
Cowboy boots nervously play with a McDonald's Bag on the ground next to a garbage dumpster. They stop when the Hispanic Orderly walks out of the hospital. He gets to the dumpster, throws a BROWN PAPER BAG in it, picks up the McDonald's bag, looks inside and leaves without a word. 
26   INT. RON'S TRAILER - NIGHT                                    26 
Ron sits at the table, removes a box of pills from the bag labeled AZT, FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 21 
Ron removes a pill, decides two is better, washes them down with a beer, and sniffs a line of coke. Looks at his reflection in the turned-off T.V. 
27    EXT. OIL FIELD - DAY                                             27 
As Ron pulls up to his jobs site in his battered '73 Lincoln, he spots T.J., Clint and a half dozen other WORKERS through the windshield, all staring at him menacingly. Before Ron gets out, the Foreman emerges through the crowd. Without a word, the guy just slowly shakes his head. Ron gives him the finger and drives off, popping a few more AZT pills. 
A27   EXT. DALLAS MERCY HOSPITAL - REAR - NIGHT                        A27 
The Hispanic Orderly throws a BROWN PAPER BAG in the dumpster, picks up a fast food bag, and leaves. 
28    EXT. RODEO STADIUM - BLEACHERS - DAY                             28 
Empty; closed for the day. Ron sits in the empty bleachers, sweaty and shivering; he looks horrible, maybe disoriented. He pops a pill of AZT and drinks from a bottle of Tequila. 
29    EXT. TRAILER PARK - NIGHT                                        29 
A labyrinth of identical trailers. Ron wanders, searching for his own. Confused, he changes direction and continues to make his way down the different rows. 
He stops in front of one and stares at the door where two YOUNG BOYS are seated on the steps, staring back at him. 
RON The hell you doin' here? 
He waves them aside. As he walks up the steps, his neighbor BUCKY and his WIFE stare at him blankly. 
RON Fuck you doin' in my house? 
Ron doesn't realize that he's not at his place. 
30    INT. DALLAS MERCY HOSPITAL - DR. EVE SAKS' OFFICE - DAY          30 
Sitting on an examining table, meet RAYON, a cross-dresser in his early 30s, in long eyelashes, earrings, painted nails with a pink scarf tied around a full brown curly wig. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 21A 
EVE (reviewing a chart) You missed your last trial appointment. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 22 
Ron I don't know what you're talking about. 
Dr. Sevard shakes his head and walks out. 
EVE Get some rest. 
She follows Sevard out of the room. 
RON Wait.   We were just gettin' somewhere. 
RAYON (O.C.) Honey, you don't have the slightest chance. 
Ron turns and sees the hospital curtain being pulled by the PATIENT in the next bed -- it's Rayon. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 24 
RAYON I'm Rayon. 
Rayon gets up and goes over to Ron's bed. 
RON Congratulations, fuck you and go back to your bed. 
RAYON Relax, I don't bite. 
Rayon looks Ron over. 
RAYON I guess you're handsome in a Texas hick, white trash, dumb, kinda way. 
RON Get the fuck outta here, whatever you are. 
RAYON Sticks and stones, cowboy. (beat) You wanna play cards? 
RON (perking up) You got cash? 
33   INT. DALLAS MERCY HOSPITAL - ROOM - NIGHT                        33 
Ron sits cross-legged on his bed across from Rayon, who has a pile of cash before him. As they lay their cards down: 
RAYON Full house. Jacks over threes. 
RON I'da figured you for queens. 
Cleaned out, Ron tosses his cards; Rayon scoops up the money. 
RAYON Sorry darlin'. 
As Ron starts to unfold his legs, he suddenly SCREAMS in pain, grabbing his calf. Rayon grabs his leg, presses his fingers deep into the muscle and massages. Ron contorts in pain, grips the side of the bed. Rayon goes deeper. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 25 
RAYON Breath.   Relax. 
Ron breaths.    Finally the pain subsides and Ron is left limp. 
RAYON Here, drink some water. 
Rayon HOLDS the cup so Ron can drink. 
RAYON You gotta stay hydrated or your muscles will cramp. 
Rayon starts to massage Ron's other foot. 
RAYON You got nice feet. 
RON Jesus Christ, I'm straight, OK! 
Rayon leaves Ron alone.    An awkward beat. 
RON Why the fuck you in here anyway? 
RAYON The AZT trial. My friend is paying me to split my dose with him. That way we'll both get some. 
RON How much is he paying you? 
RAYON Five grand. 
41   INT. DR. VASS' CLINIC - MEXICO CITY - DAY                       41 
Ron enters, blind-sided by the mayhem inside. Boxes of drugs and hospital supplies lie in various stages of unpacking. An INTERPRETER shouts above the din to his wealthy ASIAN CLIENT. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 28 
DR. VASS (50's), fit but tired, shouts in Spanish to a MAN unloading boxes. He effortlessly switches to Japanese, continues to shout to another worker. 
Dr. Vass sees Ron, quickly moves over to him. 
DR. VASS You have something for me to sign? 
RON I'm lookin' for Dr. Vass. 
Dr. Vass steps over. 
DR. VASS Speak up. 
RON I'm lookin' for Vass, for some AZT. 
DR. VASS Looking to poison yourself? 
He grabs an empty bottle of pills on the counter.   Throws it to Ron. 
DR. VASS That's from the chemical manufacturer who makes AZT, Sigma. 
Ron looks at the bottle labeled with skull and crossbones: HIGHLY TOXIC, NOT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION. 
DR. VASS First thing I tell my patients: you won't find that shit here! 
Ron looks confused. A nearby stack of boxes tumbles over. Dr. Vass shouts to no one in particular. 
VASS Who stacked those boxes there? (to Ron) Check in with a nurse. 
Dr. Vass is off, ripping open boxes. 
Ron starts to cough again.   Badly.   Vass notices, and shouts something in Spanish. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 29 
42   INT. DR. VASS' CLINIC - MEXICO CITY - DAY                        42 
Frail and weak, Ron lies on a cot, surrounded by a dozen other PATIENTS of varied nationalities. A NURSE records his vital signs in a chart, then hands it off to Dr. Vass, who peruses the information and begins reading aloud: 
DR. VASS Cocaine, alcohol, methamphetamine, AZT. (to Ron) That's what I call a recipe for disaster. 
RON (looking around) Doc, this place is a shit-hole. 
DR. VASS Who said I was a Doctor? They revoked my license to practice three years ago, that's why I'm down in this shit-hole. 
RON Why?   What'd you do? 
DR. VASS I didn't play ball. 
Ron smiles. 
DR. VASS These drugs you're doing, they're breaking down your immune system, making you susceptible to infections. 
RON So cocaine gave me pneumonia? 
DR. VASS Cocaine made you more susceptible. As did AZT. 
RON I thought AZT's supposed to help me. 
DR. VASS The only people AZT helps are the people who sell it. (beat) It kills every cell it comes in contact with, good and bad. 
RON So medically speakin', I kicked my own ass! Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 30 
DR. VASS (nods as he writes) I'm prescribing a regimen of vitamins as well as the mineral zinc to build your immune system back up. You'll also be taking Aloe and essential fatty acids. 
43   INT. DALLAS MERCY HOSPITAL - ROOM - DAY                          43 
In gloves and surgical masks, Eve looks on Nurse Frazin who is drawing blood from Rayon's arm, five other AIDS PATIENTS nearby. That done, the Nurse dispenses meds, giving each patient a paper pill cup marked with a different NUMBER. Rayon takes his pill, winces; Eve makes a mental note, then walks down the line of patients, touching each of them. She comes to Rayon, gives his shoulder a squeeze, then exits. BLACK. SUPER: 
Six months Later 
Ron sits behind a table when a MAN in a suit walks in.   He takes off his jacket and sits. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 32A 
RICHARD BARKLEY I'm Richard Barkley from the Food and Drug Administration office. 
Ron nods.   A beat. 
RICHARD BARKLEY You're a priest? Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 33 
Ron smiles.   The customs agent doesn't. 
RICHARD BARKLEY You have over 2,000 pills here. You are only allowed to bring in a ninety day supply. 
RON Well as I told the gentlemen, I am a sick man. I have cancer. I take 22 pills a day and these here vials of Vitamin A, C, E and Zinc. That there is ninety days. 
The man looks at Ron, not really buying it. He takes a bottle of Peptide T and looks at it. 
RICHARD BARKLEY Vitamins? (no answer from Ron) You do realize that importing unapproved drugs for sale is a very serious offense? 
RON Well, as I said, they're not for sale. And they ain't illegal, just "unapproved." 
A long beat; they stare at each other. 
RICHARD BARKLEY If we find the slightest indication that you're selling these drugs for profit, you will be thrown in jail... Father. 
RON Then I promise to take each and every one of them pills myself. In fact this present detainment has already put me off schedule... Son. 
50A   INT. DALLAS MERCY HOSPITAL - RECEPTION DESK - DAY               50A 
Ron talks to Nurse Frazin. 
RON I'm looking for Dr. Eve Saks. 
NURSE FRAZIN She's not here today. 
Nurse Frazin leaves. Ron looks over the counter, sees something, looks around... Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 33A 
51   INT. EVE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DALLAS - NIGHT                51 
Perfectly ordered and spotless except for files and reports piled on the floor. An exhausted Eve takes her lab coat off, picks up a study and aims for the kitchen when a KNOCK comes at the door. 
EVE It's open! 
Ron comes in. 
EVE Mr. Woodroof... Ron, I thought you were... Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 34 
RON (cutting her off) Dead? Sorry for bargin' in. 
EVE What are you doing here?   You look great. 
RON Actually I look amazin'.   But you, you look like shit. 
EVE What happened to you? 
RON So you got any music?   Or crackers? 
EVE I'm sorry, but what is this? 
RON It's a celebration of how absolutely fuckin' wrong you were. 
Ron holds up a bottle of sparkling wine. 
EVE Excuse me? 
RON Thirty days you said! Well here it is months later and I'm goin' like gangbusters. Now if that don't call for a little Cheez Whiz on a Ritz, I don't know what does! 
Ron heads for the refrigerator. 
EVE No.   Don't... I don't really eat here. 
The DOORBELL interrupts them. Ron watches as Eve crosses and opens the door, admitting Rayon, looking like shit and shaking badly in a full-length, pink fur coat. 
As Nurse Frazin monitors an AIDS PATIENT receiving a blood transfusion, Eve reviews his chart. 
EVE This man also had a transfusion? 
NURSE FRAZIN The AZT. We can tell who's on it by the symptoms. Most of them need new blood. 
EVE (looking at chart) He's actually getting worse. 
Eve looks at the sleeping Patient; she reaches for his hand. 
NURSE FRAZIN So why are they stopping the trial? 
EVE What do you mean? 
NURSE FRAZIN Barrow Wilkem, didn't you see the memo? They claim most people are feeling better and fewer people are dying. 
EVE Really? 
56   INT. DALLAS MERCY HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - DAY                     56 
In mid-conversation, Eve follows Dr. Sevard down the hall. 
EVE Transfusions always makes patients feel better. Give the placebo patients new blood and they'll feel better too. 
Sevard stops to sign a form for a NURSE. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 38 
EVE I have questions about the drug's safety. I've seen it drop white blood cells in a lot of my patients making them more susceptible to infection. 
DR. SEVARD It's Barrow Wilkem's call, Eve. So we can get the drug to the people who need it. 
EVE After six months? 
DR. SEVARD Their trial results are overwhelmingly positive. AZT is working. 
EVE But we have no idea what the long term effects are. It's irresponsible. 
DR. SEVARD These people die, Eve.     There are no long-term effects. 
EVE Can I see a copy of the study? 
DR. SEVARD It's still being written.    Here. 
He produces a two page document and hands it to Eve. 
EVE A press release from the NIH? 
Sevard crosses off.   Eve stands there, stunned. 
Her POV on the press release: "HIV-positive patients are twice as likely to get AIDS if they don't take AZT." 
57   INT. RON'S CAR - DALLAS STREET - DAY                             57 
Ron is parked on a quiet street. He counts his cash and is startled when suddenly a WOMAN gets in the passenger seat. 
RON (pulls a 9mm pistol) Jesus Mother Mary Fuckin' Christ! 
She's not a woman, it's... Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 39 
RAYON I was looking for you, Lonestar. 
RON I could of killed you! 
RAYON I feel better! I wanted to thank you. 
RON Good for you. Now get the fuck out! 
RAYON I need more of that cocktail shit you got! 
RON Listen Tinkerbell, unless you got cash or some new clients for me, I'm busy. Now get the f... 
RAYON (interrupting) Let's just do this quickly so I can get the fuck out! 
RON This is the shit that'll rot your insides. What a surprise, FDA approved. What the fuck is potassium benzoate? 
RAYON Preservative. 
Rayon throws a pack of bologna in the cart. 
RON You fuckin' kiddin' me? 
Defiant, Rayon puts his hand on his hips. 
RON Don't pollute me with that processed crap. I'm eatin' healthy. 
Ron removes the bologna and throws it at Rayon who almost fumbles the catch. 
RAYON It's protein, it's good for you. 
RON Put it back. 
Rayon tosses it back at Ron. 
RAYON You can't tell me what to do. 
Ron throws the Bologna harder at Rayon, who catches it like a pro football player, much to Ron's surprise. Rayon enjoys the moment and disappears down the isle, proud, with his bologna under the arm. 
Ron turns the corner of the next isle. T.J. is there putting a case of BEER in his shopping cart. An uncomfortable moment passes. 
T.J. Uh, hey Ron. 
Ron nods at him. 
T.J. How're you doin'? 
RON Fine. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 47 
Rayon appears at the other end of the isle.      T.J. sees him and laughs. 
T.J. Jesus, faggots everywhere. 
T.J. looks at Ron for confirmation.   Rayon reaches them and throws a bag of chips in the cart. 
RAYON Hi. 
T.J. and Ron don't answer.    An awkward beat. 
RON This is Rayon. (off T.J.'s silence) He said hi to you. 
Rayon sticks out his hand.    T.J. doesn't respond. 
RON Shake his hand, T.J. 
He doesn't. 
RON Come on, buddy, what's your fuckin' problem? 
T.J. gives Ron the finger. Ron grabs T.J.'s hand and twists it behind his back. T.J. resists, tries to get out of Ron's grip but can't. He finally extends his hand. Rayon shakes it. 
RON Good. Now get the fuck outta here and go back to your miserable life. 
T.J. stares at Ron for a while, angry, humiliated, then leaves. Ron watches him go. Rayon stares at Ron, unsure of how to react to this. A subtle smile appears on his face. 
RON What? 
Rayon's moved that Ron stuck up for him.   He starts to tear up. 
Ron sees the bag of chips in the cart and throws it at Rayon. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 48 
67   EXT. DALLAS BUYERS CLUB MOTEL - HALLWAY - DAY                   67 
Two dozen MEN, all prospective buyers, snake down the long exterior hallway. A NEIGHBOR walks by, disgusted, hugging the wall as he makes it to his own door. 
That is Ron's POV following at a distance as he arrives from the supermarket. 
72   EXT. AIRPLANE - STOCK FOOTAGE - DAY                           72 
A 747 soars across the sky.      On screen appears: 
Hayashira Chemical Lab - Okayama, Japan 
73   INT. HAYASHIRA CHEMICAL LAB - JAPAN - WAITING AREA - DAY      73 
Briefcase in hand, cowboy hat on his head, Ron waits along with JAPANESE MEN who all stare at him. After a few beats, MR. YAMATA, the lab's manager approaches. 
MR. YAMATA Mr. Woodroof? 
RON That's me. 
Yamata bows, then: 
MR. YAMATA Regarding your order. I am so sorry, but we are no longer allowed to export interferon to the United States. 
RON What do you mean? 
MR. YAMATA I am sorry. I know you've come a long way. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 50A 
RON Fourteen hours on a plane, but hey, who gives a shit, right? (off Yamata's look) (MORE) Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 51 
RON (CONT'D) Look, if it's a matter of money, I can make it worth your while, I got cash-- 
MR. YAMATA (cutting him off) Please understand. Japanese doctors will be the only ones who can make the purchase. 
And as Ron's wheels turn... 
74   INT. DR. HIROSHI'S OFFICE - OKAYAMA - DAY                        74 
CLOSE ON -- DR. HIROSHI, 40s, who sits talking on the phone. 
DR. HIROSHI (in Japanese) ...that is correct. Two thousand vials of alpha interferon. 
A REVERSE ANGLE reveals Ron, across from Hiroshi. Over the above, he slides ten $100 dollar bills across the desk. 
DR. HIROSHI (in Japanese) That's right. Delivered directly to my office. Thank you. (to Ron) Slow drip. Very strong. Slow drip. 
Ron walks to Dr. Hiroshi, thanks him, and looks him over from head to toe. 
75   INT. HOTEL ROOM - OKAYAMA - NIGHT                                75 
Ron packs his suitcase and puts on a ROLEX and an expensive ring. 
BATHROOM: 
Ron looks at his reflection in the mirror. 
76   INT. DALLAS INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - CUSTOMS AREA - DAY           76 
A CUSTOMS OFFICER looks at Ron dressed with Dr. Hiroshi's lab coat, and wearing Dr. Sevard's hair style as he talks into a large first generation cell phone. 
RON Yeah, I'm coming. Prepare the sedation. Propofol. 10 milligrams. (MORE) Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 52 
RON (CONT'D) I said I'm coming. (hangs up, to the officer) Good morning. 
77   INT. DALLAS INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - MEN'S REST ROOM - DAY        77 
Ron enters the Men's rest room carrying his suitcase and briefcase, and disappears in a... 
STALL - LATER 
Ron injects a needle into his arm. 
On the toilet, an empty VIAL from the BRIEFCASE. 
Ron takes his lab coat off and stops. A searing pain courses through his chest. Ron grimaces. The strange ringing again in his ears. Then another shooting pain... 
78   INT. DALLAS MERCY HOSPITAL - RECEPTION AREA - DAY                78 
DR. SEVARD Well the FDA confiscated over two thousand vials of alpha interferon... that he was about to sell to AIDS patients. Our patients! Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 54A 
EVE (testing the waters) Actually, I've been reading about Buyers Clubs. They say they found other drugs that are eliminating symptoms. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 55-57 
DR. SEVARD Without controlled trials, we'll never be able to cure this thing because we'll have no legitimate data. Tell your patients to stay away from him. 
With that, Sevard exits.   On Eve. 
83   INT. DALLAS BUYERS CLUB MOTEL - RAYON'S OFFICE - DAY             83 
Lots of activity, many EMPLOYEES on phones, SHIPMENTS coming in, new CLIENTS lined up through the connecting door into... 
RON'S OFFICE. Maps of the different locations around the country where buyers clubs have shown up, New-York, San- Francisco, Miami. 
RAYON (holding a phone) This guy says the Florida Buyers Club is cheaper. 
RON Then tell him to move to the fuckin' sunshine state! 
A phone cradled in his neck, Ron accepts a shipment of several dozen boxes from a guy we saw earlier in Mexico. 
RON (into phone) What do you mean you can't get it back?! It was authorized by a doctor! 
DAVID WAYNE (O.C.) The FDA said it was a Japanese doctor with no legal standing. What can I say, they make it up as they go. 
RON 84               Then check China, Amsterdam and Israel               84 cause that's where I'm fuckin' goin'! 
85   MONTAGE                                                          85

86   INT. DALLAS BUYERS CLUB MOTEL - RON'S OFFICE - DAY              86 
Not yet open for business. As Rayon and his friend SUNNY hang photos on a freshly-painted nearby wall. Eve stands across from Ron with her arms crossed. 
RON I got first hand experience with all of 'em. And I'll tell you something else, if I don't know what somethin' is, or don't trust the white coat who's trying to sell it to me, I fed-ex it to my lab in Seattle and they test if for me. 
Eve looks around at all the boxes and files. 
RON Then I test it all on myself before I give it to anyone else. (off her look) I'm my own lab rat. 
He grabs a box of meds. 
RON Compound Q. You know what happens if I come off it? My hair falls out, I lose weight, I can't get my dick up and I start to die. I got three hundred other people with the same experience. (grabs another box) Peptitde T. Gets rid of dementia. Stop takin' it and you can't think straight, walk straight, or act straight. I got over two hundred people on that. You following me? (grabs another box) DDC and DDI, both toxic, but in small doses, helps kick opportunistic infections. 
EVE Ron, I respect that you're learning about your illness but some of these people should be in the hospital. 
RON All the hospital wants is to serve up AZT. 
EVE AZT helps eradicate the virus. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 58A 
RON Fuck the virus, once you got that, you're married to it. I'm more concerned about my symptoms and survival. I mean, I'm no scientist but... 
RAYON (mocking him) You're not? 'Cause you sound so... scientific. 
Rayon and Sunny laugh like children. 
RON You fuckin' high again? 
RAYON (giggling) I dunno. 
RON Are you listenin' to what I'm sayin' here about usin' that shit? (then; noticing) And what the fuck did you do to my wall?! 
RAYON It's cranberry mocha.     For the holidays. 
Ron looks back at Eve, exasperated.    He grabs a folder off his desk. 
RON People can live with this thing for longer than they're saying. Ninety-six- percent of people diagnosed with AIDS in the U S of A will be dead in under six months. 
EVE I know the statistics. 
RON Then use them. Why give people AZT when their immune system is broken? It's fuckin' toxic! 
RON Nice work, fellas, great. This is how you got Al Capone, ain't it? 
As the Agents exit: 
DAVID WAYNE Don't piss them off. If there's a fine, we'll pay it. 
RON A fine? Fine, alright, how much? Ten thousand? Twenty thousand? I'll write you a check right now. 
Ron grabs his check book. 
RON You think that will stop me, you motherfuckers! 
93   David waves Ron down with his hands.                            93 
94   INT. DALLAS BUYERS CLUB MOTEL - RON'S OFFICE - NIGHT            94 
Rayon is prepping shipping boxes with Sunny, drawing abstract artistic designs on the boxes. 
Ron walks out of the bathroom dressed in a gangster style suit. Rayon gives him the once over. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 62 
RAYON Honey, you don't have a snowball's chance wearing that thing. 
RON Rayon, I don't need help gettin' ladies from your sorry ass. 
RAYON Trailer trash and rodeo groupies do not count as ladies. Are you sure she said the word yes? 
Fuck off! 
RAYON You got any flowers? 
Ron looks around, spots the Wild Flower PAINTING. He walks over and yanks it off the wall, looks at Rayon defiantly, puts it under his arm and storms out the door. 
95   INT. DUNSTON'S STEAK HOUSE - NIGHT                               95 
Eve waits in a booth. She watches a couple flirt at another table. The WOMAN laughs and tosses her hair back. Eve self consciously tucks her hair behind her ear. She stops, realizes what she's doing. Just then, Ron approaches with the PAINTING. 
RON It's the Wildflowers.   Texas style. 
Ron hands her the painting.    She smiles, plays along. 
EVE They're beautiful. Thank you.    And I don't even have to water them. 
Ron slides in across from her. 
RON Thanks for coming. 
A beat.   She looks at his suit and smiles politely. 
RON The IRS is on my ass.   I wonder who tipped them off? Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 63 
EVE You don't actually believe I would do that? 
RON Nah. But you gonna have to watch what you say when you're around that snake you work with. He's the virus I'm worried about. As a matter fact, if you hear of anything... 
She shakes her head, amused.   A WAITER approaches. 
RON Bring us your best bottle of Cabernet. 
The Waiter nods and leaves. 
RON Nice restaurant, beautiful woman. I feel like a human being again. (a beat) How come you ain't got no high powered corporate honey to take you dancin'? 
EVE I don't dance. 
RON That's cause you don't got a honey.   How old are you anyway? Twenty two? 
Eve shoots him a "nice try" look.   She wonders, is he here to flirt or talk business? Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 64 
EVE Why are we here? 
RON To eat, drink, enjoy life, be merry... 
101   INT. DALLAS BUYERS CLUB MOTEL - RON'S OFFICE - DAY              101 
With the line snaking out the door, Ron sits behind the desk dealing with a BUYER. 
RON That's four pills, three times a day with food. The vitamins too. 
As Ron starts putting the meds in a paper bag, we hear a commotion coming from the other room. 
RAYON (O.C.) I'm not letting you in, you have a search warrant? 
RAYON'S OFFICE: 
Rayon, still in his robe, stands blocking the doorway to Richard Barkley who signals to Tucker to take over. Tucker gestures to Rayon to move out of the way. He walks in with a FELLOW POLICE OFFICER and two DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION (DEA) agents. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 67 
RON The hell's all this? 
TUCKER Sorry, Ron. (to the Buyers) Gentlemen, I'm gonna need you all to leave the premises in an orderly fashion, please! 
Some GRUMBLING as the Buyers file out.   Barkley enters. 
RICHARD BARKLEY Mr. Woodroof, I have a court order permitting us to confiscate any and all non-FDA approved drugs or supplements. 
RON In other words, my entire inventory. 
Ron looks over at one of the FDA Agents, who has begun opening boxes. As the Agent removes an unmarked bottle: 
RON Aloe vera! It's a plant. What do you give a shit if people eat plants? 
RICHARD BARKLEY It's improperly labeled. That's a violation of FDA regulations. 
RON It's a bullshit technicality and you know it! (to Rayon) Get my lawyer on the phone. 
Rayon crosses off to make the call. 
RICHARD BARKLEY Our primary concern is preventing a market for illegal drugs. 
RON Illegal? Unapproved! These are vitamins and minerals, for Chrissake! 
RICHARD BARKLEY Vitamins and minerals that gave you a heart attack, remember? 
RON I'm not selling that stuff, you confiscated it, remember? Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 68 
The agents confiscate lots of small blue boxes and put them in an evidence bag. 
RON (sarcastic) What's the matter, you got Alzheimer, Richard? (pointing at the blue boxes) 'Cause Peptide T works for Alzheimers too, ya know? 
Tucker looks over at Ron. 
RON Come on, it's a protein! Effective with dementia which I have. Why don't you just look at my research? 
RICHARD BARKLEY Woodroof, I wouldn't want you to spend your last days in jail. If you have a product you'd like tested, fill out an application and go through the process. 
RON Don't threaten me! I'm unapproved motherfucker! The process? That's just FDA bullshit for pay up! 250 million worth! 
The Agents exit carrying boxes and bags; Barkley gives Ron a big smile. 
RICHARD BARKLEY You'll be receiving your fine for non compliance and improper labelling soon. 
Barkley leaves followed by Tucker who looks sorry for Ron. Rayon comes back to the room. He takes a last peek through the window, and pulls boxes of Peptide T from underneath his robe, with the smile of a kid on his face, handing Ron the phone. 
RAYON Your lawyer. 
RON These fuckers are comin' at me from all angles! I wanna file a restraining order! 
DAVID WAYNE (O.C.) What?   Against who? Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 69 
RON The Government and their fuckin' FDA! 
He slams down the phone. 
RON We gotta relocate! 
Tucker opens the BLUE BOX and removes a Buyers Club bottle of Peptide T and a note. 
RON (V.O.) Tuck, sorry to hear about your dad's Alzheimer. This will help. Woodroof. 
107   INT. SMALL HOME - DALLAS - DAY                                   107 
The house hasn't seen new carpet since the 60's. The conservative gay couple we met earlier, Ian and Michael, show Ron around. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 72 
RON This place is crap, I'll give you one fifty a month and fifty percent off your meds. 
IAN Mr. Woodroof -- 
RON Don't try to con me -- 
IAN We don't want money. 
RON What do you want? 
IAN The house is free.   We want to help. 
Ron looks from Ian and Michael and back again. 
RON Oh.   Well that's good news. 
Ian sticks his hand out, Ron shakes it. 
108   INT. DRADDY AUDITORIUM - DALLAS HIGH SCHOOL - NIGHT            108 
The same meeting from the beginning; packed with mostly gay MEN. A different group of people are here now, but the atmosphere is the same. 
Ron stands at the back of the auditorium with Rayon at his side chewing gum like a baseball coach. Ron flips the lights off and on... 
RON Hello... Howdy... 
The CROWD calms down, turns to look at Ron. 
RON I got what you got and I have traveled the world looking for alternative medications, stuff not available yet in America, thanks to the good folks down at the FDA. 
A murmur travels through the audience as people listen. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 73 
RON Some of you may have heard of the Dallas Buyers Club, an organization I founded with my friend Rayon. Risk might be high, but what the hell, you're risking your life every time you go into one of them there hospitals. (beat) I don't know where most of the people are who were at these meetings a year and a half ago... maybe they lost interest... maybe they're dead... but I'm here. I'm walking, talking, breathing... and ain't no one gonna take that away from me. I gotta life to lead. 
A murmur travels through the audience as people listen. 
The point of our club was to get alternative treatments and medications into the hands of those who need 'em. (beat) The cost of joining this club used to be $400 a month. Well I'm here tonight with a special offer. Anyone who's interested can come and sign up for the one-time only, rock bottom price of zero. (beat) That's right, I'm giving it away folks. 
More murmurs through the crowd. 
RON HIV don't mean shit. You ain't sick, you ain't sick. Period. You tell a guy he's got a week to live? Shit, he's already dead. You tell a guy he can keep on goin'? He'll find a way. Remember, ya ain't dyin'. But if you think you are then you ain't got nothing to lose. 
Ron does a double take at Rayon who is staring at him with tears in his eyes. Someone hesitantly applauds. A MAN gets up and walks to Ron, slowly OTHERS do too. 
109   INT. FIRST BANK - DALLAS - DAY                                 109 
A financial institution. A MAN, 50s, walks over to the waiting area and coldly signals a younger man to follow him. This is Rayon, hair slicked back, devoid of makeup and jewelry, wearing Ron's business suit. He gets up. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 73A 
110   INT. MAN'S OFFICE - FIRST BANK - DALLAS - DAY                 110 
Rayon looks at the various family PHOTOS which decorate the bookshelves of the man's office who sits behind his desk. 
RAYON Guess I didn't make the cut. 
THE MAN You made that choice yourself. 
RAYON It wasn't a choice, Dad. 
Rayon's father looks at him with disdain. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 74 
RAYON'S FATHER What do you want, Raymond? 
RAYON I'm fine, thanks.    And you?   Long time no see. 
Eve doesn't respond. 
RON You know this rule that the FDA just passed was just bullshit. Ain't no doc from here to the north pole will write them. 
EVE I know and I can't either. I'm sorry. We can't write scripts for random people and random drugs. Plus what if something goes wrong with these drugs? We could get sued, lose our license. 
RON Okay!   Never hurts to ask. 
Eve takes the hat off and hands it to Ron. 
RON Keep it, nurse Ratched! 
Ron exits the room leaving Eve with the sombrero. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 77 
113   INT. DALLAS BUYERS CLUB MOTEL - RAYON'S OFFICE - DAY               113 
Music plays. Rayon, extremely sick, holds a bottle of POPPERS, watches Sunny dance around the room amongst the stacked moving boxes. Rayon starts coughing into a scarf, pulls it away, it's covered with BLOOD. Sunny stops dancing. 
SUNNY You need to go to the hospital. 
Rayon can't respond. 
SUNNY That's it.      I'm driving you, right now. 
Sunny walks over and picks up Rayon, throws him over his shoulder. 
RAYON Okay, okay. I'll go. Put me down.       Let me get some things first. 
Rayon picks up his bag. 
114   EXT. DR. VASS' CLINIC - MEXICO CITY - DAY                          114 
Ron enters the clinic with a suitcase. 
115   INT. DR. VASS' CLINIC - MEXICO CITY - DAY                          115 
CLOSE ON a BUTTERFLY, emerald green wings with a blood red middle. Its wings flap with life as a hand holds it and a needle is inserted into its middle, extracting its fluids. 
Dr. Vass conducts the experiment with Ron looking on.     In the background, another makeshift lab. 
DR. VASS Secretions that the caterpillar uses to protect itself during the incubation period... 
Dr. Vass empties the contents of the syringe into a test-tube. 
DR. VASS ...act as a non-toxic anti-viral for humans. The answer to a question. 
Dr. Vass sets the test-tube on a tray, crosses to a table lined with boxes, postmarks in different languages covering their surfaces. He rummages on the table, finds a report. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 78 
DR. VASS (handing it to Ron) The Lancet medical journal published a study conducted in France. Proves AZT alone is too toxic for most to tolerate, and had no lasting effect on HIV blood levels. Of course, Barrow Wilkem and the NIH did not include the study in their press release. 
Ron takes the study, looks it over. 
RON Doesn't surprise me at all. 
Vass hands Ron some more paperwork. 
DR. VASS These are early trial results for Fluconazole. 
RON The anti-fungal, right?   I read about this. 
DR. VASS You want to take some home? 
RON As much I can carry. 
DR. VASS We need a thousand more like you. 
RON Hell Vass, I'm just tryin' to run a business. 
116   INT. DALLAS MERCY HOSPITAL - ICU ROOM - NIGHT                116 
Eve walks in, breathless. Eyes sunken, breathing shallow, Rayon is hooked up to an I.V. as Nurse Frazin adjusts an oxygen mask on his face. 
131   INT. DRADDY AUDITORIUM - DALLAS HIGH SCHOOL - DAY                131 
The room is packed. On the dais stands Richard Barkley from the FDA. To his left and right, are representatives from the Center for Disease Control, the National Institute of Health and ACT-UP. They HEAR something SQUEAKING and look up: 
At the back of the room, Ron enters, hooked up to an I.V. drip on wheels that he carries along as he starts passing out copies of his flyer. 
RON Here you go, please read this. 
RICHARD BARKLEY (O.S.) Mr. Woodroof, will you kindly tell us what you are doing? 
Everyone turns to look at Ron. 
RON I'm givin' people information... on this trial I'm in, right now. I want everyone here to know what's going on. 
RICHARD BARKLEY And what is going on? 
RON Why was Peptide T cut off? A non-toxic drug, that I have proof works and that according to the National Institute of Mental Health, is completely safe. 
RICHARD BARKLEY Mr. Woodroof, you are nothing but a common drug dealer-- 
RON I'm a drug dealer? You're the drug dealer. The pharmaceutical companies are the drug dealers. 
Ron grabs a bag of jelly beans out of the hands of a person in the audience. Holds them up. 
RON The yellow number fives, red, green and purple dye you put in this here candy causes seven kinds a cancer. 
A SECURITY MAN approaches, Ron walks away from him. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 87 
RON The aspartame in my diet coke, the steroids in my meat, the hormones in my milk, the antibiotics in the chicken. Now that's the shit the FDA knows will kill you. Yet you're all up there worried that some sick people will find somethin' without you and y'all won't get paid. 
Ron throws the bag of jelly beans to the security man who catches it. And he leaves the room, squeaking away. 
132   INT. RON'S CAR - DALLAS STREET - DAY                            132

133   INT. DALLAS MERCY HOSPITAL - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY              133 
Sevard puts Ron's flyer down on the table in front of Eve who stands in front of the medical board. 
DR. SEVARD We think it is in everyone's best interest that you resign. 
Eve looks at Dr. Sevard who meets her gaze with calculated coldness. 
EVE I won't.    You'll have to fire me. 
She starts to leave, stops, turns around. 
EVE Y'all go fuck yourselves! 
134   INT. DALLAS BUYERS CLUB HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT             134 
Ron appears from the kitchen with a beer. 
RON One left. 
EVE We're splitting that. 
Ron cracks the beer and hands her the can. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 88 
RON That was a ballsy move! 
Eve looks away.   Ron opens his arms... 
RON A nice, warm hug... (she accepts it) ...and a day of watchin' some bull ridin', that's what you need, doctor Woodroof's order. 
She smiles and they both let go, uneasy with the closeness. 
RON Don't you miss a regular life? 
RON Thanks for the tip, Tuck. 
And as Ron exits the house... 
TUCKER I'll be there, man, and don't you fuckin' hit me again! 
141   EXT. DALLAS BUYERS CLUB HOUSE - DAY                           141 
A line of customers is out the door as three Dallas Police Cars pull up. As Tucker gets out of the lead car, he is greeted by Richard Barkley and two FDA Agents. They head inside. That's Ron's POV... 
142   INT. DALLAS BUYERS CLUB HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY             142 
...as he's watching from a window. 
Eve tends to several buyers club members, I.V.s attached to them, lying on the floor. 
A NEWS TEAM films the entire thing. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 91 
EVE (to the reporter) This is Fluconazole. It helps them with Thrush. 
Suddenly, the front door OPENS.   Police are in the room, guns drawn. 
RICHARD BARKLEY No one move. Put your hands in the air. 
The news camera keeps rolling. 
TUCKER Ronald Woodroof? 
Ron steps up through the crowd. 
TUCKER I have a warrant for your arrest, a search warrant for the premises, and a court order to cease and desist business immediately. 
And with that, Ron allows Tucker to handcuff him. And as he does, the Customers "Boo" and "Hiss" loudly, all caught on by the News Crew. 
RICHARD BARKLEY Turn off that camera. Now! 
But the Camera Man doesn't stop filming. 
RICHARD BARKLEY (to Ron) Please instruct the rest of these people to leave, now. 
RON I ain't no cop.    Why'nt you tell 'em? 
Tucker escorts Ron outside. 
143   EXT. DALLAS BUYERS CLUB HOUSE - DAY                              143

FINAL DRAFT - 5/24/96 PINK REVISION - 5/17/96 BLUE REVISION - 7/12/96 YELLOW REVISION - 7/17/96 
EXT.  LAS VEGAS (STOCK FOTTAGE) - NIGHT 
GRAPHIC:  1967 - SOMEWHERE IN NEVADA 
It is set against the obvious skyline of Las Vegas. 
INT.  DR. EVIL'S PRIVATE QUARTERS - DAY 
The lair is 1960's high-tech.  We see a huge oversized conference table with six scary-looking EVIL ASSOCIATES, including a Latin American REVOLUTIONARY in a field jacket and turtleneck, TWIN NORDIC DOCTORS, and a METER MAID. 
ANGLE ON:  A RING WITH DR. EVIL'S INSIGNIA ON IT.  THE RINGED HAND IS STROKING A WHITE FLUFFY 
CAT. 
DR. EVIL (face always unseen) Gentlemen, are we all here?  Good. As you know, my plot to high-jack nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage has failed.  Again.  This organization will not tolerate failure. 
He presses a button.  The Revolutionary, the twin Nordic doctors, and the meter maid's chairs tip 
back and fall into a pit.  Their chairs return empty and smoking. 
DR. EVIL Mustafa... 
ANGLE ON:  MUSTAFA, an Arab with a red Fez. 
DR. EVIL Frau Farbissina... 
ANGLE ON FRAU FARBISSINA in a severe Salvation Army uniform. 
DR. EVIL I spared your lives because I need you to help me rid the world of the only man who can stop me now.  We must go to London.  I've set a trap for Austin Powers! 
EXT.  CARNABY STREET - DAY 
MUSIC:  Soul Bossanova by QUINCY JONES. 
We start on a pair of BEATLE BOOTS and peg-top crushed velvet pants walking down the street in rhythm, à la Saturday Night Fever. 
We pan up to reveal AUSTIN POWERS, International Man of Mystery.  He's a swinger, with 
medium-length Mod hair and sideburns and he wears National Health Services glasses. 
Austin walks along Carnaby Street taking photographs.  It is that perpetual bright sunny day you see in Sixties movies. 
Austin, bursting with life, gives a two-handed handshake to a MOD FREAK, who's just gotten off a red double-decker bus. 
Austin salutes a strolling BOBBY, then comes across TWO BEAUTIFUL MOD GIRLS who are excited to see him.  They all start to twist to the music, including the Bobby. 
FREEZE FRAME - TECHNICOLOR BLUE TINT - TITLE CARD 
(PRODUCTION NOTE:  ALL TITLE CARDS WILL BE DONE IN TECHNICOLOR FREEZE FRAMES À LA SWEET CHARITY.) 
In the middle of the street, THREE MODELS wait impatiently to be photographed in a makeshift photo shoot area. 
One wears a short-skirted Stewardess outfit.  One wears a metallic silver pantsuit with matching cowl.  The other wears a see-through Mary Quant dress. 
AUSTIN (taking photos) Alright, luv!  Love it!  Turn...pout for me baby.  Smashing! 
We see that AUSTIN HAS VERY BAD ENGLISH TEETH.  The model in the stewardess outfit foes on all fours. 
AUSTIN Crazy baby.  Give me some shoulder. Yes!  Yes!  Yes! (beat) No.  No. 
Show me love.  Yes!  And...done.  Here you go, luv.  I'm spent. 
Austin throws the camera in the air behind him.  An ASSISTANT scrambles and catches it before it hits the ground. 
The driver of the Jag is Austin's associate, MRS. KENSINGTON, a beautiful woman in her thirties. 
They drive against obvious REAR PROJECTION of 1960's London. 
AUSTIN Hello, Mrs. Kensington. 
MRS. KENSINGTON Hello, Austin Just then, a FLASHING RED LIGHT goes off and we hear a distinctive PHONE RING. 
MRS. KENSINGTON That'll be Basil Exposition, Chief of British Intelligence. 
The glove compartment revolves to reveal a picture phone. ANGLE ON:  PICTURE PHONE SCREEN.  We see BASIL EXPOSITION a distinguished older man.  A desk plate reads:  "Basil Exposition, Chief of British Intelligence." 
BASIL EXPOSITION (on picture phone) Hello, Austin.  This is Basil Exposition, Chief of British Intelligence. 
You're Austin Powers, International Man of Mystery, and you're with Agent 
Mrs. Kensington.  The year is 1967, and you're talking on a picture phone. 
AUSTIN We know all that, Exposition. 
BASIL EXPOSITION I just wanted to be extremely clear so that everyone knows what's going on at any given time.  We've just received word that Dr. Evil, the ultimate square, is planning to take over the world. 
AUSTIN Dr. Evil?  I thought I put him in jail for good. 
BASIL EXPOSITION I'm afraid not.  Earlier this week, Dr. Evil escaped from Zedel Edel Prison in Baaden Baaden and now he's planning a trap for you tonight at the Electric Psychedelic Pussycat Swinger's Club in Picadilly Circus here in swinging London. 
A panel revolves to reveal a map of London with lights showing Austin's position and the location of the club. 
AUSTIN Just where you'd never think to look for him.  We'll be there. 
BASIL EXPOSITION Good luck, Austin. 
AUSTIN Thank you. 
BASIL EXPOSITION Oh, and Austin&emdash 
AUSTIN Yes? 
BASIL EXPOSITION (pause) Be careful. 
AUSTIN Thank you. (to Mrs. Kensington) Let's go, baby! 
EXT.  STOCK FOTTAGE - PICADILLY CIRCUS - NIGHT 
On top of one building is a three-story high BOB'S BIG BOY figure. 
EXT.  ELECTRIC PSYCHEDELIC PUSSYCAT SWINGER'S CLUB - NIGHT 
The Jaguar pulls up in front of the swinging nightclub. Mrs. Kensington steps out of the car, dressed in a tight leather fightsuit.  She looks fabulous. 
INT.  ELECTRIC PSYCHEDELIC PUSSYCAT SWINGER'S CLUB 
It's a swinging club.  FREAKS abound.  In one corner, there is a PRESS CONFERENCE in progress. 
MICK JAGGER Hey Austin Powers, it's me, Mick Jagger. 
AUSTIN Hey, Mick! 
MICK JAGGER Are you more satisfied now sexually, Austin? 
AUSTIN Well, you can't always get what you want. 
MICK JAGGER (thinking) "You can't always get what you want!" That's a great title for a song! I'm 
gonna write that, and it'll be a big hit. 
AUSTIN Good on ya, man. 
MICK JAGGER Groovy! 
FULL SCREEN INSERT 
A vinyl 45 of "You Can't Always Get What You Want." 
FEMALE ANNOUNCER (on PA) Warm liquid goo phases complete. Stage Three, reanimation beginning. 
Austin comes to life out of the goo on a draining platform. 
FEMALE ANNOUNCER (on PA) Reanimation complete.  Stage Four, cleansing beginning. 
INT.  EXAMINATION AREA 
Technicians lead a half-asleep Austin to a screened area, where only his feet and head are visible.  He's washed off with a series of hot-water jets. 
FEMALE ANNOUNCER (on PA) Cleansing complete.  Stage Five, evacuation beginning. 
He's given futuristic inoculations and then led to a screened- in toilet area.  We can hear the sound of PEE ENTERING THE BOWL. 
He PEES for a while, then a little longer. 
And then EVEN LONGER STILL. 
The stream seems to be subsiding...then begins STRONGER than ever. 
He is still PEEING. 
Finally, it STOPS. 
FEMALE ANNOUNCER (PA) Evacuation com... 
He begins PEEING again. 
A little LONGER. 
Then in short staccato BURSTS. 
The it STOPS.  Pause. 
Two DRIPS. 
FEMALE ANNOUNCER Evacuation... (waiting) Complete!  The cryogenic state of Austin Powers is now completed. 
Austin lies in a bed tilted up in an extreme angle à la Dr. Frankenstein's lab.  NURSE TECHNICIANS administer injections and monitor electrodes, IV's, and other biological sensors. 
AUSTIN (weakly) Where am I? 
BASIL EXPOSITION You're in the Ministry of Defense. It's 1997.  You've been cryogenically frozen for thirty years. 
AUSTIN (shouting) WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE? 
BASIL EXPOSITION The shouting is a temporary side- effect of the unfreezing process. 
AUSTIN Yes, I'm having trouble controlling&emdash (shouting) THE VOLUME OF MY VOICE! 
BASIL EXPOSITION You might also experience a slight fever, dry mouth, and flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation. Austin, this is Commander Gilmour, Strategic Command, and General Borschevsky, Russian Intelligence. 
AUSTIN Russian Intelligence?  Are you mad? 
BASIL EXPOSITION A lot's happened since you were frozen, Austin.  The cold war's over. 
AUSTIN Thank God.  Those capitalist dogs will finally pay for their crimes against the people, 
hey Comrades? 
BASIL EXPOSITION We won, Austin. 
AUSTIN Groovy.  Smashing!  Good on ya! (to Gilmour) Nice tie.  Yea capitalism! 
COMMANDER GILMOUR Mr. Powers, the President's very concerned.  We've got a madman on the loose in Nevada. 
BASIL EXPOSITION It's Dr. Evil. 
AUSTIN When do I begin? 
BASIL EXPOSITION Immediately.  You'll be working with Ms. Kensington. 
AUSTIN You mean Mrs. Kensington? 
MUSTAFA But Dr. Evil, all you need to do is&emdash (holding up tennis ball) --work with this tennis ball.  Squeeze it for twenty minutes a day.  A few months of that and it'll be just as strong as the other arm... 
DR. EVIL And look what you've done to Mr. Bigglesworth! 
ANGLE ON MR. BIGGLESWORTH 
who is now totally hairless, with a fringe of white hair around it's ears, like Dr. Evil himself. 
MUSTAFA We could not anticipate feline complications due to the reanimation process&emdash 
DR. EVIL (face unseen) Silence! 
ANGLE ON A HAND WITH DR. EVIL'S RING ON IT 
Dr. Evil presses a button.  Mustafa's chair tips back and he falls backwards into a pit. 
MUSTAFA (blood-curdling scream) Ahhhhhhhhh! 
DR. EVIL (face unseen) Let this be a reminder to you all that this organization will not tolerate failure. 
MUSTAFA'S SCREAMS ECHO FAINTLY 
ANGLE ON:  DR. EVIL FOR THE FIRST TIME.  HE IS IN HIS EARLY FIFTIES AND IS BALD, WITH A HIDEOUS 
scar on his cheek. 
DR. EVIL Gentlemen, let's get down to business. 
More muffled SCREAMS. 
DR. EVIL We've got a lot of work to do. 
MUSTAFA (O.S.) (muffled) Someone help me!  I'm still alive, only I'm very badly burned. 
DR. EVIL (slightly distracted) Some of you I know, some of you I'm meeting for the first time. 
MUSTAFA (O.S.) (muffled) Hello up there!  Anyone!  Can someone call an ambulance?  I'm in quite a lot of pain. 
DR. EVIL (very frustrated) You've all been gathered here to form my Evil Cabinet.  Excuse me. 
He picks up a white phone and MURMURS into it. 
MUSTAFA (O.S.) (muffled) If somebody can open the retrieval hatch down here, I could get out. See, I designed this device myself and...oh, hi!  Good, I'm glad you found me.  Listen, I'm very badly burned, so if you could just&emdash SFX:  Muffled Gunshot 
MUSTAFA (O.S.) (muffled) Ow!  You shot me! 
DR. EVIL Right.  Okay.  Moving on. 
MUSTAFA (O.S.) (muffled) You shot me right in the arm!  Why did&emdash SFX:  Muffled Gunshot. Dr. Evil waits.  Nothing. 
DR. EVIL Let me go around the table and introduce everyone.  Frau Farbissina... 
ANGLE ON FRAU FARBISSINA 
DR. EVIL ...founder of the militant wing of the Salvation Army.  Random Task... 
RANDOM TASK is a large Korean man in a butler's uniform. 
DR. EVIL ...a Korean ex-wrestler, evil handyman extraordinaire.  Show them what you do. 
He stands up, bows, then takes off his shoe and THROWS it. It knocks the head off a sculpture across the room. 
DR. EVIL Thank you, Random Task.  Patty O'Brien... 
PATTY O'BRIEN, a small, wiry Irishman with fiery eyes. 
DR. EVIL ...ex-Irish assassin.  His trademark? 
Around PATTY O'BRIENS WRIST is a charm bracelet. 
DR. EVIL A superstitious man, he leaves a tiny keepsake on every victim he kills.  Scotland Yard would love to get their hands on that piece of evidence. 
PATTY O'BRIEN (heavy Irish accent) Yes, they're always after me lucky charms! 
FRAU FARBISSINA Yes. (calling out) Scott! 
SCOTT EVIL walks out.  He is fifteen, grungy, and wears a Kurt Cobain T-shirt. 
SCOTT EVIL Hi. 
DR. EVIL Hello, Scott.  I'm your father, Dr. Evil. (emotional) I have a son!  I have a son! Everyone, I have a son! (gesturing to globe) Someday, Scott, this will all be yours. 
SCOTT EVIL I haven't seen you my whole life and now you show up and want a relationship?  I hate you! 
EXT.  JAGUAR - DRIVING - VEGAS - DAY 
Vanessa and Austin drive in his perfectly-preserved Jag. 
AUSTIN You've preserved my Jag!  Smashing! 
VANESSA Yes, we've had it retrofitted with a secure cellular phone, an on-board computer, and a Global Geosynchronous Positioning Device.  Oh, and finally, this. 
The glove compartment revolves to reveal a display of various dental hygiene products&emdash floss, toothpaste, toothbrush, dental mirror, and cleaning tool. 
AUSTIN Let me guess.  The floss is garotte wire, the toothpaste contains plastic explosives, and the toothbrush is the detonation device. 
VANESSA No, actually.  I don't know how to put this really.  Well, there have been fabulous advances in the field of dentistry. 
AUSTIN Why?  What's wrong with my teeth? 
EXT.  VEGAS HOTEL - NIGHT 
The Union Jack-emblazoned Jaguar pulls up to the front door. 
INT.  VEGAS HOTEL ROOM 
Vanessa carries her compact flight attendant bag and Austin takes his two bright red oversized leatherette Samsonite suitcases. 
AUSITN Which side of the bed do you want? 
VANESSA You're going to sleep on the sofa. I'd like to remind you, Mr. Powers, that the only reason we're sharing a room is to support our cover story that we're a married couple on vacation. 
AUSTIN So, shall we shag now, or shall we shag later?  How do you like to do it?  Do you like to wash up first? Top and tails?  A whore's bath? Personally, before I'm on the job, I like to give my undercarriage a bit of a how's-your-father. 
AUSTIN (off her angry reaction) I'm just joking, Vanessa.  Trying to get a rise out of you. 
They both laugh. 
VANESSA Let's unpack. 
HER LUGGAGE:  In the inside flap is a types list of contents. All of her items are in separate, labeled plastic bags. 
AUSTIN Gor blimey, nerd alert. 
HIS LUGGAGE:  He pulls out a Nehru jacket and a huge Remington shaver with huge English plug. 
HER LUGGAGE:  She pulls out a compact clothes steamer/travel iron and a Braun blow drier. 
HIS LUGGAGE:  He pulls out a vintage 1967 Playboy and a bottle of Jurgens lotion. 
HER LUGGAGE:  She pulls out Wet-Naps, her underthings in a plastic baggie marked "Underthings" and her shoes in a baggie marked "Shoes." 
HIS LUGGAGE:  He pulls out a miniature meditation gong and Hai Karate cologne. 
HER LUGGAGE:  She pulls out a dossier labeled "Dr. Evil - Top Secret." 
HIS LUGGAGE:  He pulls out the Swedish penis enlarger pump. Vanessa sees it. 
AUSTIN Hey, who put this in here?  Someone's playing a prank on me!  Honestly, this isn't mine. 
VANESSA (suffering) I'm sure. 
AUSTIN I think I'll give that stew a ding-a- ling. 
Austin casually dials the phone while looking at his palm. After a beat we hear a loud MALE VOICE coming through the handset. 
MOVIE PHONE VOICE (through handset) Hello!  And welcome to 777-FILM! 
AUSTIN Yes, I also like to live dangerously. 
The dealer deals him the ten. 
NUMBER TWO You're very brave. 
AUSTIN Cards are not my bag, man.  Allow myself to introduce...myself.  My name is Ritchie Cunningham. 
Vanessa is mortified. 
AUSTIN (indicating Vanessa) This is my wife, Enid. 
NUMBER TWO My name is Number Two. 
He extends his hand to shake.  Austin extends his hand, but misses and begins to shake the bimbo's breast.  There is an awkward pause.  Austin takes off his glasses. 
VANESSA (rescuing him) Number Two?  That's an unusual name. 
NUMBER TWO My parents were hippies. (indicating Italian woman) This is my Italian confidential secretary. 
ITALIAN WOMAN (Italian accent) My name is Alotta (quickly) Alotta Fagina. 
AUSTIN I'm sorry, I'm just not getting it. It sounds like you're saying your name is a lot of...never mind. Listen, cats, I'm going to crash. It's been a gas. 
NUMBER TWO Bye-bye, Mr...Cunningham? 
AUSTIN Peace, baby. 
Austin and Vanessa leave. 
INT.  CASINO 
VANESSA Why did you leave so soon? 
AUSTIN That cat Number Two has an X-ray eyepatch.  I get bad vibes from him, man.  Listen, we should go back to the room, but first I have to go to the naughty chair and see a man about a dog. 
He heads to the rest room. 
INT.  HIGH ROLLERS TABLE - CASINO 
Number Two has been watching them.  He presses a BUTTON. 
INT.  BATHROOM - CASINO 
Austin enters to see a gregarious TEXAN in a huge cowboy hat.  Austin enters a stall.  The Texan enters the adjoining stall. 
TEXAN Good luck, buddy.  You don't buy food, you rent it. 
AUSTIN Too right, youth. 
INT.  BATHROOM STALL 
Austin sits down.  Behind him, a panel SLIDES OPEN, revealing Patty O'Brien.  His charm bracelet JINGLES.  Austin looks back.  Patty's bracelet is now garotte wire.  He wraps it around Austin's throat.  Austin gets his thumbs between the wire and certain death. 
AUSTIN (grunting) Uh, uh! 
INT.  TEXAN'S STALL 
The Texan can only see Austin's feet, which are moving about frantically.  He can hear the 
GRUNTING. 
TEXAN Hey pardner, just relax, don't force it!  Use some creative visualization. 
INT.  AUSTIN'S STALL 
Austin GRUNTS and snaps his head back into Patty O'Brien's crotch.  Patty O'Brien GROANS in agony. 
PATTY O'BRIEN (groaning) Ughhhhh... 
Austin breaks free of the charm bracelet/garotte, grabs Patty O'Brien's head, and pulls it between his legs so that it hovers above the toilet bowl. 
AUSTIN Who does Number Two work for? 
AUSTIN I'm spent.  What say you we go out on the town? 
EXT.  LAS VEGAS STREET - BUS - NIGHT 
Austin and Vanessa are on the top deck of an open air double- decker English bus having a full-course formal dinner. They're drinking champagne. 
Austin is cutting sausages into ever-smaller pieces, holding his cutlery very English.  He has cut one piece to the point to which it's a speck.  H puts it on the fork and offers it to her. 
AUSTIN Fancy a nibble? 
VANESSA I couldn't have another bite. 
They laugh.  They drink.  It's TOM JONES, serenading them. 
They begin to dance. 
Austin gives her roses.  Austin is wooing her. 
EXT.  LAS VEGAS STREET - NIGHT 
They walk along the brightly-lit streets, laughing, enjoying each other's company.  Austin gives Vanessa a pet rock.  She graciously accepts. 
64  LAS VEGAS - SUPERIMPOSITION MONTAGE 
Austin and Vanessa stroll against a changing series of backgrounds&emdash neon signs, Vegas icons, dice showgirls, etc. 
INT.  HOTEL ROOM 
Sounds of MOANS and GROANS.  We see Austin's backside sticking out above a piece of furniture, then Vanessa's high-heeled leg straining upwards. 
VANESSA (O.S.) Watch out, you're on my hair! 
AUSTIN (O.S.) Sorry.  Move your hand to the left. There you go.  Gorgeous. 
VANESSA (O.S.) Go!  Just go! 
We hear a SPINNING SOUND. 
AUSTIN (O.S.) Left hand, blue. 
We now see that Austin and Vanessa are playing TWISTER.  She reaches for left hand blue and they fall over, laughing. 
AUSTIN Wait a tick, I forgot something in the lobby. (moving behind the couch) I know what.  I'll take the stairs. 
Behind the couch, Austin mimes going down stairs. 
AUSTIN Maybe I'll take the escalator. 
Austin mimes the smooth descent of an escalator. 
AUSTIN Why take the escalator when I could take a canoe? 
Austin mimes rowing a canoe behind the couch. 
VANESSA I haven't had fun like that since college. 
AUSTIN I'm sorry. 
VANESSA Why? 
AUSTIN I'm sorry that bug up your ass had to die. 
She laughs too much, making a SNORTING sound. 
VANESSA Always wanting to have fun, that's you in a nutshell. 
AUSTIN No, this is me in a nutshell. 
Austin mimes being trapped in a nutshell. 
AUSTIN Help!  I'm in a nutshell!  What kind of nut has such a big nutshell?  How did I get into this bloody great big nutshell? 
Vanessa laughs again, SNORTING, tipsy. 
One side of the chart is labeled "Secret Projects."  Under that we see "Human Organ Trafficking", "Carrot Top Movie", and in CLOSE-UP&emdash "Project Vulcan." 
We see schematics for some sort of subterranean probe and a cross-section of the earth labeled "Crust, Mantel, Core." 
AUSTIN And I'm spent. 
The front door opens.  It's Alotta. 
AUSTIN You seem surprised to see me. 
ALOTTA I thought you'd quit while you were ahead. 
AUSTIN What, and watch all my earnings go... (smug) Down the toilet? 
ALOTTA What do you want, Mr...Cunningham, was it? 
AUSTIN Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina.  May I call you Alotta... (pause) Please? 
ALOTTA You may. 
AUSTIN Your boss, Number Two, I understand that cat's involved in big underground drills. 
ALOTTA Virtucon's main interest is in cable television, but they do have a subterranean construction division, yes.  How did you know? 
AUSTIN (smug) I didn't, baby, you just told me. 
ALOTTA It's for the mining industry, Mr. Cunningham.  We can talk about business later.  But first, let me slip into something more comfortable. 
AUSTIN Behave! 
MUSIC:  "The Look of Love" by SERGIO MENDEZ AND BRAZIL 66 Alotta goes behind a Japanese screen.  In silhouette she takes off her clothes and puts on a robe.  She opens a pair of sliding doors to reveal an elaborate Japanese bath grotto. 
INT.  JAPANESE BATH 
She slips off her robe, revealing a DR. EVIL LOGO TATTOO on her shoulder, and enters the water. 
ALOTTA Come in. 
AUSTIN I'd rather talk about Number Two. 
ALOTTA Don't you like girls, Mr. Cunningham? Come in, and I'll show you everything you need to know. 
Austin takes off his clothes.  He is extremely hairy.  He goes in.  Alotta produces a soapy sponge and swims over. 
ALOTTA May I wash you? 
AUSTIN Groovy. 
She washes his back.  Behind his back, she pulls out his wallet and looks through it.  ANGLE ON HIS IDENTIFICATION. It reads "AUSTIN POWERS, INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY." 
ANGLE ON HIS VARIOUS CARDS:  CHARGEX, PLAYBOY CLUB, ETC. SHE PUTS HIS WALLET BACK IN HIS 
trousers. 
ALOTTA In Japan, men come first and women come second. 
AUSTIN Or sometimes not at all. 
ALOTTA Care for some saki? 
AUSTIN Sak-i it to me! 
Alotta pours them saki.  Alotta unscrews the diamond in her ring.  A sign on the inside of her ring reads "Relaxation Pills."  She drops two PILLS into his drink. 
Austin takes a sip.  His eyes glaze over.  He's instantly woozy. 
ALOTTA How do you feel, Mr. Cunningham? 
AUSTIN Mmmm...I feel extreme relaxation. 
A big BUBBLE comes to the surface, right in front of Austin. 
AUSTIN (reciting poem) 'Pardon me for being rude, It was not me, it was my food. 
DR. EVIL Gentlemen, my name is Dr. Evil. 
They all look up at the SCREEN. 
DR. EVIL In a little while, you'll find out that the Kreplachistani warhead has gone missing.  Well, it's in safe hands.  If you want it back, you'll have to pay me...ONE MILLION DOLLARS! 
The UN representatives are confused.  Number Two COUGHS. 
DR. EVIL (frustrated) Sorry.  ONE-HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS! 
The representatives ARGUE amongst themselves. 
UNITED NATIONS SECRETATY Gentlemen, silence! (to Dr. Evil) 
NOW, MR. EVIL&EMDASH 
DR. EVIL (angry) Doctor Evil!  I didn't spend six years in evil medical school to be called 'mister'. 
UNITED NATIONS SECRETARY Excuse me.  Dr. Evil, it is the policy of the United Nations not to negotiate with terrorists. 
DR. EVIL Fine, have it your way.  Gentlemen, you have five days to come up with one 
hundred billion dollars.  If you fail to do so, we'll set off the warhead and destroy the world. 
UNITED NATIONS SECRETARY You can't destroy the world with a single warhead. 
DR. EVIL Really?  So long. 
The screen goes BLANK. 
DR. EVIL (to evil associates) Gentlemen, in exactly five days from now, we will be one-hundred billion dollars richer. (laughing) Ha-ha-ha-ha. (slightly louder) Ha-ha-ha-ha. 
EVIL ASSOCIATES (laughing with him) Ha-ha-ha-ha. 
DR. EVIL & ASSOCIATES 
(LOUDER AND MORE STACCATO) 
HA-HA-HA-HA-HA! 
(louder again, and even more evil and maniacal) 
HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA! 
(PAUSE) Ohhhh, ahhhhhh... (pause, quieter) Ohhh, hmmmm. (pause, very quiet) hmn. 
There is an uncomfortable pause, because clearly we should have FADED TO BLACK.  The evil associates look around the room, not knowing what to do with themselves. 
DR. EVIL Okay...Well...I think I'm going to watch some TV. 
EVIL ASSOCIATES Okay.  Sure. 
They exit the frame awkwardly. 
INT.  BRITISH MAKESHIFT HQ 
Austin and Vanessa enter past two BRITISH MILITARY POLICEMAN. There is a communications center, a makeshift armory, bunks, etc. 
We see Basil, dressed as the Vegas-era Elvis. 
AUSTIN Hello, Exposition. 
BASIL EXPOSITION Austin, Vanessa, let me bring you up to speed.  Dr. Evil has high-jacked a nuclear warhead from Kreplachistan and is holding the world ransom for one-hundred billion dollars.  If the world doesn't pay up in four days, he's threatening to destroy the world. 
AUSTIN Thank you, Exposition.  Only two things, scare me, and one is nuclear war. 
BASIL EXPOSITION What's the other? 
AUSTIN Excuse me? 
BASIL EXPOSITION What's the other thing you're scared of? 
AUSTIN Carnies. 
VANESSA Listen, I know I'm just being neurotic, but I can't shake this suspicious 
feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina.  I mean, I don't want to sound paranoid, but I've had some bad relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues. You went to her penthouse.  It makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities, but I can't help but feel this weird, irrational, unfocused...well, jealousy.  I'm sorry. 
AUSTIN Don't be sorry.  You're right to be suspicious.  I shagged her.  I shagged her rotten. 
VANESSA (stunned) I can't believe you made love to her just like that.  Did you use protection? 
AUSTIN Of course, I had my nine-millimeter automatic. 
VANESSA No, did you use a condom? 
AUSTIN Only sailors use condoms, man. 
VANESSA Not in the Nineties. 
AUSTIN Well they should, filthy beggars, they go from port to port.  Alotta meant nothing to me. 
VANESSA (pause) Well, it means something to me.  If you want us to have a relationship, you've got to be a one-woman man. 
AUSTIN It was just a shag, Vanessa.  You're everything to me. 
VANESSA You just don't get it, do you, Austin? Good night.  Welcome to the Nineties, you're going to be very lonely. 
INT.  HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 
MUSIC:  "What the World Needs Now" by BURT BACHARACH Austin looks at his address book.  ANGLE ON THE PAGE:  We see a list of names crossed out, with 
comments written in beside them.  Beside Jimi Hendrix we see "Deceased, Drugs"; Janis Joplin, "Deceased, Alcohol"; Mama Cass, "Deceased, Ham Sandwich"; Jerry Garcia. "Deceased, Gratefully"; Jane Fonda, "Square". 
Austin looks at his old pair of Sixties-era canvas sneakers. He picks up his new pair&emdash REEBOK SHAQ CROSS-TRAINER PUMPS.  He pumps them too much and they explode. 
Austin looks out his window at the lonely city below.  We see the CDs he's just purchased, including SERGEANT PEPPER'S and BURT BACHARACH'S GREATEST HITS. 
Austin goes over to the kitchenette and puts a can of unopened Campbell's Tomato Soup in the microwave and turns it on.  It explodes in a shower of sparks and soup. 
He puts the CD on a record player and drops the needle.  The NOISE is awful. 
Austin plays MORTAL COMBAT III.  His fighter gets his head ripped off, and blood spews out. 
Austin is genuinely frightened by this. 
INT.  BATHROOM 
Austin attempts to use the Water Pik, but the head is too loose and water shoots all around the bathroom. 
EXT.  CAR - STREETS OF LAS VEGAS - NIGHT 
Austin drives alone and sad against the rear-projection of Las Vegas. 
INT.  CASINO BAR - NIGHT 
Austin drinks by himself while a gaggle of EIGHT CONTEMPORARY YOUNG PEOPLE IN LOVE cavort.  They look at him like he's a freak. 
Austin raises a bottle of ZIMA as if to say "hey, I'm down with that".  They shoot him sarcastic peace signs.  Austin is pleased. 
INT.  HOTEL ROOM - DAY 
Austin sits watching the TIME-LIFE The Last Thirty Years video on TV.  Vanessa enters. 
AUSTIN Hello, luv. 
VANESSA Thirty years of political and social upheaval.  The fall of the Berlin wall, a female Prime Minister of England, the abolishment of Apartheid, a fascinating tapestry of human strum und drang. 
AUSTIN Yeah, I can't believe Liberace was gay.  Women loved him, man.  I didn't see that one coming. 
VANESSA Basil was very concerned to know where you were last night. 
AUSTIN Out and about, doing odds and sods. 
VANESSA I'll tell him.  By the way, I've decided we should keep our relationship strictly professional. 
INT.  THERAPIST'S OFFICE - NEXT DAY 
ANGLE ON THE THERAPIST AND THE GROUP.  They are stunned. 
PSYCHEDELC SCENE BREAK 
MUSIC:  Psychedelic Wa-wa Pedal Funky Drummer Beat TITLE GRAPHIC:  Sock It To Me Austin and the go-go girl dance crazily. 
EXT.  VIRTUCON HIGH RISE - NEXT MORNING 
INT.  HALLWAY - VIRTUCON 
A TOUR is in progress.  Austin, Vanessa, and other TOURISTS ride on an electric tram. 
AUSTIN Since I've been unfrozen, I've had a rancid taste in my mouth.  Do you have a piece of gum? 
VANESSA (in her own world) Do you think she's prettier than I? 
AUSTIN Who? 
VANESSA You know who. 
AUSTIN No!  Don't lay your hang-ups on me, Vanessa.  You're being very trippy. 
VANESSA I'm looking at you, and the whole time I can't help thinking you had your willie inside her hootchie-kooch. 
AUSTTIN Well put.  Listen love, we can't keep having this fight.  I'm an International Man of Mystery. Sometimes in the course of my work to save the world I have to shag some crumpet.  It's all part of the job. 
TOUR GUIDE Welcome to Virtucon, the company of the future. (pointing to large display window) Virtucon is a leading manufacturer of many items you'll find right in your own home.  We make steel, volatile chemicals, petroleum-based products, and we also own the Franklin mint, which makes decorative hand- painted theme plates for collectors. (holds up plate) Some plates, like the Gone With The Wind series, have gone up in value as much as two-hundred and forty percent, but, as with any investment, there is some risk involved. 
The people on the tour APPLAUD. 
TOUR GUIDE Coming up on the left, we have the Virtucon gift shop, offering a wide range of Virtucon licensed products. On the right, you'll notice a door that leads to a restricted area. Only authorized personnel are allowed beyond that point. 
INT.  VIRTUCON GIFT SHOP AREA 
All the tourists head for the gift shop.  Austin notices a SEVEN-FOOT-TALL SCIENTIST leaving the "RESTRICTED AREA" with a FOUR-HUNDRED-POUND FEMALE SCIENTIST.  They both wear Virtucon coveralls. 
AUSTIN I'll take him, you take her. 
The seven-foot-tall male scientist goes to the men's room; the four-hundred-pound woman goes to the ladies room.  Austin and Vanessa follow. 
We hear from inside either washroom the sound of PEOPLE BEING KNOCKED OUT. 
Austin and Vanessa exit wearing the scientists' coveralls over their clothes.  Magically, the coveralls fit perfectly. They go through the doors into the restricted area. 
INT.  HALLWAY - RESTRICTED AREA 
They approach the security GUARD. 
VANESSA Austin, we don't look anything like our photo badges. 
AUSTIN Don't worry, baby.  I picked up a mind control technique during my travels to India.  I learned it from my guru, the late Guru Shastri, a chaste man who mysteriously died of a disease that had all the hallmarks of syphilis. 
Just watch me.  Watch me, now. 
They reach the guard. 
GUARD Hi, folks.  You're entering a restricted zone.  Can I see your security badges? 
AUSTIN Sure. 
They flash their security badges to the guard. 
ANGLE ON AUSTIN.  WE PUSH IN SLOWLY AS AUSTIN CONCENTRATES, RAISING ONE EYEBROW AND THEN THE 
other, back and forth. 
MUSIC:  Mystical Indian sitar. 
AUSTIN (hypnotist-like) Everything seems to be in order. 
GUARD (looking at the badges) Hey, wait a minute&emdash 
ANGLE ON AUSTIN.  He redoubles his eye-brow-raising. 
AUSTIN Hang on!  I'm going to floor it! 
He engages a lever.  It goes only slightly faster. 
TWO SECURITY GUARDS jump in front of the steamroller.  They are acting like they're frozen, ad if in the headlights of a fast-approaching car. 
GUARD Noooooooooooooo! 
AUSTIN Where did you learn to shoot? 
VANESSA Where did you learn to drive? 
ANGLE ON THE GUARDS.  ONE OF THE GUYS JUMPS OUT OF THE WAY AS IF "IN THE NICK OF TIME."  THE 
steamroller is now 8 yards away.  The other army guy is still frozen in the path of the oncoming steamroller. 
GUARD Noooooooooooooo! 
VANESSA Austin, watch out! 
AUSTIN (looking around) Where?  Where? 
ANGLE ON THE GUARD.  HE'S BATHED IN THE HEADLIGHTS OF THE STEAMROLLER, WHICH IS STILL 3 YARDS 
away. 
GUARD Noooooooooooooo! 
ANGLE ON AUSTIN AND VANESSA.  AUSTIN IS FRANTICALLY JERKING THE STEERING WHEEL AND TRYING TO 
downshift.  SFX:  Metal grinds.  The shifter breaks off along with a gaggle of wares.  He desperately jams on the breaks. 
ANGLE ON THE GUARD.  HE IS FINALLY RUN OVER BY THE STEAMROLLER.  THERE IS AN INORDINATE AMOUNT OF 
blood and guts. 
By now, Austin and Vanessa are right by the door.  They run out into the hallway. 
INT.  HALLWAY 
The coast is clear. 
VANESSA Thank God, Austin, we made it. 
AUSTIN Yes, act naturally and we'll split this scene the way we came in, Vanessa. 
From behind, a HAND knocks Vanessa and Austin out.  It is Random Task flanked by four SECURITY 
GUARDS. 
INT.  STEAMROLLER TESTING FACILITY 
We see the aftermath.  Several WORKMEN sweep up the blood and guts with large squeegees and brooms.  One of them turns to reveal "Steamroller Accident Response Team" written on his jumpsuit. 
Another WORKMAN leans down to the body with a hand broom and dust pail to sweep up blood.  ZOOM IN on the steamrolled Army guy's ID tag, which reads "STEVE HARWIN." 
EXT.  SUBURBAN HOUSE - LOS ANGELES 
It is a pleasant, Marcus Welby-like ranch-style house.  We hear a PHONE RINGING. 
INT.  KITCHEN 
A pleasant-looking MIDDLE AGED LADY answers the phone. 
MIDDLE AGED LADY Hello? (pause) Yes, this is Mrs. Harwin. (pause) Yes, I have a son named Steve Harwin. (pause) Yes, that's right, he's a henchman in Dr. Evil's Private Army. (pause) What?  Killed? (pause) How? (pause) Run over by a steamroller?  Oh my God.  Thank you for calling. 
She HANGS UP.  A FOURTEEN-YEAR-OLD enters. 
FOURTEEN-YEAR-OLD Hi Mom!  When's Steve coming home? He said he was going to teach me to play ball. 
MRS. HARWIN Sit down, Billy, I have some bad news.  As you know, your brother Steven was a henchman in Dr. Evil's Private Army. 
BILLY Was?  What is it, Mom? 
INT.  UNITED NATIONS SECRET MEETING ROOM 
ON SCREEN:  Stock footage of volcanoes erupting and animated charts of magma squirting through the Earth's layers. 
DR. EVIL (voice over) So powerful it can penetrate the Earth's crust, delivering a 50 kiloton nuclear warhead into the planet's hot liquid core.  Upon detonation, every volcano on the planet will erupt. 
The various representatives are ABUZZ.  Behind the British delegation sits Basil Exposition.  To his right, sits Mrs. Exposition with a hideous BLACK EYE. 
AMERICAN UN REPRESENTATIVE Why should we pay him the money? He's only got one warhead and he's going to detonate it deep underground. 
BASIL EXPOSITION (the light shifts towards dramatic as he speaks) My God, man, don't you understand? It won't just be active volcanoes, inactive ones will erupt as well. Seven-eighths of the Earth's land mass will be deluged with hot magma. Tectonic plates will shift, causing massive earthquakes.  Imagine no United Kingdom.  Think of it, no cricket, no tea, no freshly toasted crumpets smothered with Devonshire clotted cream, the diving mystery of Stonehenge.  Imagine severing forever the continuity of Britannic majesty, the demise of this sceptered isle, this jewel, this England... 
BRITISH UN REPRESENTATIVE Any word from Powers? 
BASIL EXPOSITION (back to normal) I'm afraid we've lost contact with him. 
BRITISH UN REPRESENTATIVE I see. 
UNITED NATIONS SECRETARY Dr. Evil, it seems we have no choice but to pay your ransom. 
INT.  DR. EVIL'S MAIN CHAMBER 
DR. EVIL Gentlemen, your deadline is in three hours.  You have your instructions. 
Good-bye. 
The screen goes BLACK. 
DR. EVIL Come join us for dinner, won't you Mr. Powers? 
INT.  DR. EVIL'S PRIVATE QUARTERS 
Austin and Vanessa are seated at a table with Frau.  WAITERS serve food. 
MUSIC:  Sexy Matt Helm-type theme 
DR. EVIL I think you'll enjoy the food.  I have the best chef in the world. His name is Ezekial.  He's made of seventy-five percent plastic. 
Scott enters. 
DR. EVIL Scott my boy, come here.  How was your day? 
SCOTT EVIL Well, me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and, like, they don't speak English right, and so my buddy gets into a fight, and he goes 'hey, quit hassling me cause I don't speak French or whatever', and the other guy goes something in Paris talk, and I go 'um, just back off' and he goes 'get out' and I go 'make me'. 
DR. EVIL (trying to hide contempt) Fascinating.  What are your plans for this evening? 
SCOTT EVIL Thought I'd stay in.  There's a good tittie movie on Skinemax. 
DR. EVIL And that's how you want to live your life, is it? 
SCOTT EVIL Yeah.  What? 
ANGLE ON A PANEL OF BUTTONS THAT HAS EVERYONE'S NAMES ON IT. DR. EVIL'S HAND HOVERS OVER THE 
button labeled "SCOTT."  Frau Farbissina slaps his hand away. 
DR. EVIL Scott, I want you to meet Daddy's nemesis, Austin Powers. 
SCOTT EVIL Why are you feeding him?  Why don't you just kill him? 
DR. EVIL In due time. 
SCOTT EVIL But what if he escapes?  Why don't you just shoot him?  What are you waiting for? 
DR. EVIL I have a better idea.  I'm going to put him in an easily-escapable situation involving an overly- elaborate and exotic death. 
SCOTT EVIL Why don't you just shoot him now? Here, I'll get a gun.  We'll just shoot him.  Bang!  Dead.  Done. 
DR. EVIL One more peep out of you and you're grounded.  Let's begin. 
A PRIVATE ARMY SOLDIER grabs Austin and Vanessa.  Dr. Evil hits a button.  One whole wall slides out to reveal a tank. 
DR. EVIL Mr. Powers, Vanessa, some friends of mine are joining us for dinner. 
Austin begins drawing out the floss to take up the slack. Meanwhile, the slow-dipping mechanism is edging towards the sea bass.  Unfortunately, Austin is still drawing out the floss.  He keeps pulling out floss. 
More floss still.  The mechanism continues to sink.  Finally, the floss line goes TAUT.  Austin ties it off high on the pole of the slow-dipping mechanism.  Austin holds out his hand like a surgeon&emdash 
Vanessa places a tube of toothpaste in his hand.  Meanwhile the guard is reaching to undo the floss.  Austin places the open tube on his palm, aimed at the guard.  Vanessa WHISTLES at the guard loudly.  He turns around. 
AUSTIN Judo chop! 
Austin JUDO CHOPS the toothpaste tube, sending a stream of toothpaste into the guard's eyes. 
GUARD (screaming, rubbing his eyes) My eyes!  My eyes! 
Austin folds the tube across the top of the wire, grabbing both ends. 
AUSTIN Hold on, Vanessa! 
She grabs onto him and they slide down the floss to safety right as the dipping mechanism goes under the water. Meanwhile, the guard waits for them with toothpaste smeared all over his face. 
He and Austin STRUGGLE. 
The guard manages to get Austin pinned to the ground, Austin's head dangling over the water.  SEA 
BASS circle.  The water boils, dangerously close to Austin's head. 
VANESSA (shouting) Austin, watch out! 
Austin FLIPS the guard over.  The SEA BASS chew the guard's head off like a blender. 
AUSTIN Not a good time to lose one's head. 
VANESSA Indeed. 
AUSTIN That's not the way to get ahead in life. 
VANESSA Yes. 
AUSTIN It's a shame he wasn't more headstrong. 
VANESSA Shut up. 
AUSTIN Fair enough. 
They head out a door.  ANGLE ON THE HEADLESS TORSO.  The name tag reads "JOHN SMITH." 
EXT.  HOOTERS RESTAURANT - DAY 
It is a sports bar-type restaurant that has scantily clad BUSTY WAITRESSES. 
INT.  HOOTERS RESTAURANT 
At a table we see fifteen or so TWENTY-SOMETHING GUYS, scouting chicks, drinking mugs of beer. 
GUY 1 I can't believe John Smith is getting married tomorrow. 
GUY 2 Where is Smittie anyways?  It's not like him to be late for anything, especially his own stag party. 
GUY 3 Well, you know he's a henchman for Dr. Evil.  Sometimes they work late. Can I just say something that may sound a little sappy?  I think it's a testament to our friend John that so many of his buddies showed up in his honor.  There's a lot of love in this room. 
A large-breasted WAITRESS approaches with a phone. 
WAITRESS Hi, I have a phone call here for the John Smith party. 
GUY 1 Hello? (pause) Yes, I have a friend named John Smith. (pause) That's right, he's in Dr. Evil's private army. (pause) What?  He's dead? (pause) Decapitated by mutated flying sea bass?  Oh my God!  OK, thank you. 
He hangs up. 
GUY 2 (to Guy 1) Hey Bill, what's wrong?  Was that John?  Is he coming late? 
GUY 1 Guys, John's not coming. 
GUY 2 Why? 
GUY 1 He was decapitated by mutated flying sea bass. 
FEMBOT Hello, Mr. Powers, care to have a little fun? 
AUSTIN (looking at his watch) No, actually, I have to save the world. 
He runs towards to door to exit.  Suddenly, A PAIR OF FEMALE LEGS drop and wrap around Austin's neck and lift him up. His feet leave the floor. 
Another FEMBOT cartwheels up to Austin.  Nozzles pop out of the tips of the Fembot's bra. 
AUSTIN Is it cold in here? 
A cloud of multicolored gas spews from the nozzles.  Austin is overcome.  The room starts to spin. 
INT.  DR. EVIL'S MAIN CHAMBER - CONTROL AREA 
Dr. Evil sits into his chair with his radiation suit on. 
DR. EVIL Arm the probe! 
A small electric flatbed comes in carrying the nuclear warhead.  A PHALANX of Dr. Evil's soldiers run beside it. The cart approaches the subterranean probe and the warhead is loaded up into its tail. 
INT.  FEMBOT'S LAIR 
Austin is on the bed being held down by the Fembots. Psychedelic music plays.  Projected colored swirling lights flash.  The Fembots swirl around seductively. 
AUSTIN (delirious) I've got to get Dr. Evil! (eyes closed, fingers in his ears) Margaret Thatcher naked on a cold day!  Margaret Thatcher naked on a cold day!  Margaret Thatcher naked on a cold day! 
INT.  DR. EVIL'S MAIN CHAMBER 
The (very phallic) Vulcan droops to its down position. 
DR. EVIL Probe in place. 
TECHNICIANS in "VIRTUCON" lab coats scurry about, being technical. 
DR. EVIL Five minutes to go.  Let the penetration countdown begin. 
Dr. Evil presses a button marked "PENETRATION BEGIN."  Next to it is a large button that says "ABORT."  ANGLE ON AN EASTERN EUROPEAN TECHNICIAN at a microphone. 
EASTERN EUROPEAN TECHNICIAN (on PA, very slowly, with very thick accent) Five minutes and COUN-ting. 
EXT.  DESERT 
Vanessa leads fifteen COMMANDOS on ATCs across the sand. 
INT.  FEMBOT LAIR 
Two Fembots guard the door and five are on the bed in come- hither poses. 
FEMBOT You can't resist us, Mr. Powers. Eventually you'll give in. 
AUSTIN Au contraire, I think you can't resist me. 
MUSIC:  Sexy Matt Helm-type theme Austin starts his seductive dance.  He does a quick head count of the Fembots, reaches out of frame, pulls out eight cigarettes, put them in his mouth and lights them with a blowtorch. 
He throws seven cigarettes one by one.  Each cigarette lands perfectly in a different Fembot's mouth.  Austin smokes the remaining cigarette. 
Austin begins to do a seductive striptease.  The Fembots are aroused.  He takes off his shirt, revealing his hairy chest, and focuses his sexual energy on one Fembot. 
She begins to shake violently, her head shaking back and forth like in Jacob's Ladder. 
Eventually her head explodes.  Austin is now stripped down to his Union Jack bikini briefs and 
turns to another Fembot.  Her head explodes. 
He takes off his shoes and throws them away cavalierly. Then he tosses down his lit cigarette and grinds it with his bare foot.  He gives a look of disguised pain. 
He mouths "I love you" to another Fembot.  Her head explodes. He does the 'I'll call you' hand signal to yet another Fembot, whose head explodes. 
Austin does a hip-thrust to another and her head explodes. Austin leans over and wags his rump to the two remaining Fembots. 
AUSITN Oh, I fell over. 
Their heads explode simultaneously.  All the Fembots are lying on the floor, smoking.  Just then, Vanessa enters, flanked by a COUPLE OF COMMANDOS.  She surveys the scene and looks at Austin in his briefs.  She's hurt.  The commandos salute Austin. 
VANESSA I'll secure the perimeter. 
INT.  CONTROL AREA 
Austin enters the control area.  A VIRTUCON ARMY MAN fires at him.  Austin returns fires, shooting up some electrical equipment.  Live wires dangle dangerously.  Austin sees Mr. 
Bigglesworth running out a read door. 
DR. EVIL (O.S.) Come, Mr. Bigglesworth! 
Austin heads for the door until he smacks into AN INVISIBLE FORCE FIELD.  He turns and sees a bank of old-fashioned computers labeled "DESTRUCTACON 5000". 
DESTRUCTACON (V.O.) Good afternoon, Mr. Powers, I'm the Destructacon 5000.  I'm programmed to prevent you from progressing beyond this point.  You might as well surrender.  Resistance is futile. Your odds of survival are 23,763,273 to 
AUSTIN Well, Destructacon 5000, you have quite a head on your shoulders, I dare to coin. 
DESTRUCTACON (V.O.) Yes, I am programmed to answer any question. 
AUSTIN Really?  Let me ask you this.  What is love? 
DESTRUCTACON (V.O.) That does not compute. 
AUSTIN Why not?  It's a question. 
DESTRUCTACON (V.O.) Love is...love is...love is... 
The computers begin to smoke.  Alarm bells ring. 
DESTRUCTACON (V.O.) Remjack!  Remjack! (singing) Daisy, Daisy... (faster) Remjackremjackremjack! 
There is a muffled explosion.  The computer goes dark.  Austin passes through the force field and heads for the door until he hears&emdash 
EASTERN EUROPEAN MAN (on PA) Subterranean detonation&emdash one minute and COUN-ting. 
He begins looking furiously for the abort button. 
AUSTIN (to Eastern European Man) Where's the abort button? 
The Eastern European Man holds up his finger as if to say 'give me one second.' 
EASTERN EUROPEAN MEAN (on PA) Forty-five seconds and COUN-ting. (to Austin) It's right over there. 
Austin sees the abort button.  It is across the room.  Just then, Random Task enters.  Austin sees him and goes to shoot him, but he has run out of bullets.  Random task takes off his SHOE. 
Austin makes his way across the room to the button. 
Random Task THROWS HIS SHOE. 
ANGLE ON SHOE SPINNING IN THE AIR 
The shoe HITS AUSTIN IN THE HEAD.  Austin pauses.  The shoe has not killed him.  It has just hurt him slightly. 
AUSTIN Ow!  That really hurt.  I'm going to have a lump there, you idiot!  Who throws a shoe?  You fight like a woman. 
EASTERN EUROPEAN MAN (on PA) Fifteen seconds and COUN-ting. 
Random task blocks Austin's way to the button.  He stands there, menacing, missing one shoe. 
Exposed wires are everywhere.  On the counter beside Austin is a Big Gulp. 
AUSTIN Care for a drink? 
Austin throws the drink at Random Task's feet.  It lands in front of him on a pile of exposed wires.  Electricity travels through the Big Gulp, up Random Task's wet sock, ELECTROCUTING him. 
He begins to SMOKE, and then dies. 
AUSTIN Shocking. 
EASTERN EUROPEAN MAN Three...two...one... 
A 50 kiloton explosion from deep in the earth rocks the control area. 
EXT.  STOCK FOOTAGE MONTAGE - VOLCANOS ERUPTING 
ALOTTA (choking) It's the teeth. 
VANESSA OK, I believe you.  But you still must be chopped. 
Vanessa gives her a judo chop. 
VANESSA Judo chop! 
Meanwhile, Dr. Evil has run to the egg shaped rocket, which closes and begins to lift up through 
A HOLE IN THE CEILING.  HE RUNS IN.  ON THE WAY, HE FLIPS A SWITCH WHICH SAYS "SELF-DESTRUCT - 
5:00 MINUTES." 
EASTERN EUROPEAN MAN (O.S.) (on PA) Five minutes to self-destruct and COUN-ting. 
Austin SHOOTS and misses.  Rocket exhaust pours out of the hole in the ceiling. 
AUSTIN Let's split! 
Austin and Vanessa run out the door into the... 
INT.  CORRIDOR 
They pass Number Two, who is front of an open safe, stuffing his pockets with cash while the others are trying to escape. Austin and Vanessa run to the main chamber... 
INT.  MAIN CHAMBER 
...to the main corridor... 
INT.  MAIN CORRIDOR 
...past the Fembot lair, over the wedged-in cart, to the escape ladder.  They begin to climb. 
INT.  MAIN CHAMBER 
Explosions, debris, the cavern begins to collapse. 
134  STOCK FOOTAGE - DESERT FLOOR - MERCURY TEST SIGHT 
Ground caving in from an underground nuclear explosion. 
EXT.  RAFT - MIDDLE OF THE OCEAN - DAY 
Austin and Vanessa are floating in a large inflatable raft. 
FIERY DEBRIS falls in the water around them. 
VANESSA I have something to tell you. 
AUSTIN Lay it on me. 
VANESSA I love you, Austin. 
AUSTIN That's fab, because I love you, too, Vanessa. 
VANESSA Kiss me. 
AUSTIN Behave! 
Austin and Vanessa draw towards each other, preparing for a passionate kiss.  Just as their lips are about to touch, however, they are interrupted by a strong WIND and the noise of a HELICOPTER OVERHEAD.  Their hair is blown all about and the waves are whipped into a frenzy. 
AUSTIN Just when things were getting interesting. 
ANGLE ON BASIL EXPOSITION WEARING SCUBA GEAR, BEING LOWERED ON A ROPE FROM THE HELICOPTER.  HE 
stops just above them. 
BASIL EXPOSITION Well, Austin, you've stopped Dr. Evil from destroying the world with his subterranean nuclear probe, and somehow you and Agent Kensington managed to escape unscathed from his evil lair. 
AUSTIN I'd say that about sums it up, Exposition. 
BASIL EXPOSITION Not quite, actually.  Vanessa, I have something for you.

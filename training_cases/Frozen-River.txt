He stares blankly at her. She can think of nothing else to say. He walks out. 
Ray resumes unpacking ponies. 
A moment later PAT, 22, rushes in, looking sorry. As Pat hangs up her coat, Ray glimpses a tatoo just above her low riding pants with the words "How You Doin'?". 
Ray takes the last of her cigarettes out of the pack and heads out the back door. 
RAY (CONT'D) See ya' tomorrow. 
8   INT./EXT HORIZON,   ROUTE 37 - DAY                             8 
Ray drives down a two-lane highway. It is empty flat land but for a few trailer homes and barns. 
She passes a lonely sign: "BRIDGE TO CANADA." 
Up ahead another sign: "AKWESASNE LAND OF THE MOHAWK." 
From the car, the Reservation consists of shabby houses with no siding, tax-free gas stations and dive bars with homemade signs. Ray slows a little to check out the parking lots scanning for her husband's car. 
Up ahead she sees a sign: "WOLF MART TAX FREE GAS AND CIGARETTES. 
9   EXT. WOLF MART GAS STATION - DAY                               9 
Ray pulls in to the combo gas station, restaurant and mini mart. 
A MOHAWK TEENAGER wearing a bandana RUNS out to the CAR without a coat, rubbing his hands together to ward off the cold. 
MOHAWK TEENAGER Fill it up? 
She rolls down the window, digging for change under the seat of her car. She counts it out. 
RAY Just three...uh, no...two seventy one, two, three, four. 
MOHAWK TEENAGER Two seventy four. 
He nods and goes to the pump. She finds a wadded up five dollar bill. 
RAY (yells out window) Make that seven seventy four. 
She spots a sign for "TRAILWAYS" bus in the window. 
RAY (CONT'D) Did you see a Blue Acclaim come in here last night? 
MOHAWK TEENAGER Blue Acclaim...no, but I only worked until 9 PM. You can ask inside. 
Ray glances inside at the mostly empty restaurant but for a few older Mohawk women. 
RAY No, that's okay. 
MOHAWK TEENAGER Did you want to support our Mosquito Lacrosse League. It teaches basic Lacrosse skills to the kids three to five. 
Ray shakes her head. 
MOHAWK TEENAGER (CONT'D) Thanks, anyway. Have a good day. 
10   INT./EXT. ROUTE 37 INDIAN RESERVATION - DAY                 10 
Ray continues down the highway through the reservation. 
She comes to a huge warehouse, the "MOHAWK BINGO PALACE." 
She glances over at the sea of cars surrounding it. At the end of a row she spots it: a BLUE ACCLAIM. 
Ray abruptly turns in. 
11   EXT. MOHAWK BINGO PALACE PARKING LOT - DAY                  11 
Ray pulls up alongside the Acclaim and recognizes it by the "EASY DOES IT" bumper sticker. 
She gets out and looks inside. There is a small plastic T- Rex on the floor of the backseat. 
She leans against the car for a moment. 
RAY Thank you. Oh God, thank you, thank you thank you... 
After a moment Ray looks up at the Bingo Palace and heads for the entrance. 
RAY (CONT'D) You son of a bitch! 
12   INT. BINGO PALACE ENTRANCE -   DAY                          12 
A SHORT, CHUBBY MOHAWK TICKET TAKER in her 60s, with piercing blue eyes and missing teeth sits perched on a metal chair beside a velvet rope. 
TICKET TAKER Sunrise session is almost over. Next session starts at 10:30. 
RAY I just need to look inside. 
Ray starts to walks toward the door and the ticket taker sticks out her foot. 
RAY (O.S.) (tentative, controlled) Troy? Versales says as long as we get the money in by Christmas we won't lose the deposit. (pause) I think we need to talk about this, so come on out.(Pause) Troy? Troy? 
16   EXT. LILA'S CAMPER - DAY                                    16 
Ray aims the gun and FIRES into the camper door. 
17   INT. LILA'S CAMPER - DAY                                    17 
The shock of the blast throws Lila off the cot. She looks at the SMOKING HOLE. 
RAY (O.S.) I'm not kidding, honey, come on out. 
18   EXT. LILA'S CAMPER - DAY                                   18 
Keeping behind the door for cover, Lila opens it. Ray looks inside: there is no sign of Troy. 
LILA (from behind the door) The Tribal police don't like people shooting holes in other people's houses. 
Ray looks at her. 
RAY This is New York State so quit the bullshit and give me my damn keys! 
Lila throws the keys out the door. Ray picks them up off the ground. Lila shuts the door with her foot. 
19   EXT. LILA'S CAMPER - DAY                                   19 
Ray gets in the Horizon and pulls it in behind the Acclaim then digs in the trunk, pulling out a rope. 
She ties one end to the Acclaim's back fender and the other to the Horizon's front fender. 
Lila watches out the camper window. 
Ray gets in the Acclaim and starts it up slowly TOWING the Horizon a few feet before the rope SNAPS. 
Ray gets out and looks at the broken rope. She begins digging in the trunk for more rope. 
Lila opens the camper door and looks at the bullet hole. 
LILA This camper belongs to my brother in law. He won't like this. 
RAY (over her shoulder) Then you should quit stealing cars. 
LILA I thought it was abandoned, the guy driving it got on a bus. 
Ray stops. 
RAY Did you see where the bus was headed? 
LILA New York or Buffalo, I'm not sure. 
Ray RE-TIES the tow line with the remaining rope. 
This time the Horizon goes an inch or two before the rope SNAPS. Ray gets out. 
RAY (under her breath) Shit! 
Ray RIFLES through the trunk for more rope. 
"Home on the Range" plays on the cell phone in Ray's back pocket. 
Lila touches the bullet hole in the camper and listens to Ray's conversation from the doorway. 
Ray puts the phone back in her pocket and takes an old belt of her husbands and tries to attach the fenders of the cars. 
Ray gets back in the Acclaim and tries TOWING the Horizon once again. 
This time the right side of the front fender SNAPS OFF and droops to one side. 
Ray gets out and looks at Lila. 
RAY (CONT'D) I'm not leaving this here. 
LILA (points at the Acclaim) I got a friend who might buy that. 
RAY It's not for sale. 
LILA He'll pay more than it's worth. 
Ray ignores her. 
LILA (CONT'D) Maybe two thousand. 
RAY Why's that? 
LILA He's always looking for cars with button- release trunks. 
Ray thinks about it. 
LILA (CONT'D) He don't need papers or anything. 
They reach the midpoint of the river and pass it silently. 
LILA You gotta pick up some speed to get up the bank. 
Ray speeds up. The Acclaim bounces up the steep bank. 
LILA (CONT'D) It's just on the other side of those trees. 
25   EXT./INT. ACCLAIM AT JIMMY'S GARAGE LOT- DAY               25 
Ray and Lila pull into a used-car lot surrounded by a chain link fence. There is no sign of life. Ray stops. 
LILA Honk the horn. 
Ray honks. 
Suddenly, from under a gutted truck, A HUGE BLACK DOG, part wolf, SPRINGS onto the hood of the Acclaim. 
Ray is pinned against her seat at the sight of the dog. Lila GRABS the gun out of her hand and points it at Ray. 
LILA (CONT'D) Just keep your mouth shut. 
Ray stares at the snarling dog. 
LILA (CONT'D) Just keep it shut. Okay? 
Ray nods never taking her eyes off the dog. 
Lila honks the horn again and keeps the gun low and out of sight. 
Out of the garage comes JIMMY, 33, a stocky Mohawk, eating a sandwich. 
Jimmy looks suspiciously at Ray before he sees Lila. 
Thunder growls. 
JIMMY Thunder! SHUT UP!. 
The dog GROWLS ferociously at Ray. 
JIMMY (CONT'D) Get back under there! 
Thunder jumps off the hood and disappears back under the trunk. 
Jimmy walks around to the passenger side of the car. Lila rolls down her window. 
LILA Hi, Jimmy. 
Jimmy glances at Ray. 
JIMMY He don't like whites, Lila. 
LILA Sorry. 
JIMMY And your late. 
LILA Sorry. 
JIMMY I shouldn't even be dealing with you. 
LILA I know. Sorry. 
He hands her a paper bag. 
Jimmy goes back to the garage and opens the door. TWO YOUNG CHINESE MEN in cheap jogging suits follow him out, looking around. 
26   INT. ACCLAIM JIMMY'S GARAGE LOT - DAY                       26 
Lila hands the paper bag to Ray and points the gun at her, keeping it low and out of sight. 
LILA Count it. 
RAY What's going on here? 
LILA Just count it. 
Ray opens the bag. It's full of cash. All fifties and hundreds. Ray counts it. 
LILA (CONT'D) How much is there? 
RAY Twelve hundred. 
Lila opens the glove compartment and presses the trunk release. 
Jimmy motions to the Chinese men to get in the trunk. Jimmy shuts it. 
He taps twice on the hood of the car and walks back to the garage. 
LILA (to Ray) Let's go. 
LILA (CONT'D) Roll down your window. 
He walks up slowly and hands her a brown paper bag. 
LILA (CONT'D) Count it. 
Ray opens the bag and counts out the cash, as before. 
RAY Twelve hundred. 
Lila takes the cash from Ray and pops the trunk release. The two Chinese men hurry out. The Dealer ushers them into a Garage. 
LILA Let's go. 
34   INT. ACCLAIM ON ROUTE 37 - DAY                             34 
Ray and Lila return down Route 37 past the sign "AKWESASNE, LAND OF THE MOHAWK" 
Lila keeps the gun on Ray. 
LILA Turn down there. 
Ray looks at the dirt road leading into the woods. 
LILA (CONT'D) Stop here. 
Ray stops. 
LILA (CONT'D) Now open the door. 
Ray hesitates. Lila jams the gun in her side. 
LILA (CONT'D) Open the door. 
Ray opens the door. 
LILA (CONT'D) Now get out. 
Ray doesn't move. 
RAY You can't have my car. 
LILA Get out. 
RAY You can't have my car. 
Lila tries to push Ray out the driver's door with her feet. 
Ray clings to the steering wheel. 
RAY (CONT'D) No! 
Suddenly, Ray grabs Lila by the hair and pulls her head down to the car seat. Lila hits Ray in the head with the gun. 
RAY (CONT'D) (gasps) Fuckin' bitch! 
Bleeding and holding Lila's hair, Ray pries the gun out of Lila's hand. Lila grabs the sack of money, jumps out of the passenger side of the car and takes off into the woods. 
Ray chases her, but Lila is faster and gets ahead, then disappears into the woods. Ray stops, panting, and wipes the blood from her forehead. 
RAY (CONT'D) (calls after her) Little bitch! 
Ray stares after her for a long moment then gets back in the Acclaim. 
35   EXT. RAY'S TRAILER YARD - DAY                              35 
Ray drives up in the Acclaim. 
T.J., wearing PROTECTIVE GOGGLES, works on the broken Duck Kiddie ride with a BLOW TORCH. He doesn't notice Ray. 
Ray covers over the cut with her hair and gets out and walks up behind him and taps him on the shoulder. He jumps and cuts the flame. 
RAY I told you not to use that thing when I'm not here. 
T.J. If I get it working I can sell it. 
She looks at the rusted pieces of it. 
RAY I don't care. Don't use that thing when I'm not here! 
T.J. Rentaworld called. They're coming to get the TV if you don't pay by four tomorrow. 
He notices the car. 
T.J. (CONT'D) Did you find him? 
RAY No. 
T.J. Where was the car? 
On the windshield of the Malibu in huge white letters: 
MIKE Nothing with a trunk. 
LILA That thing has been sittin' here for six months. 
MIKE I don't want Bernie in my face. Okay? 
LILA He doesn't have to know. 
Mike rolls his eyes. 
37   INT. RAY'S TRAILER - DAY                                37 
Ray wakes up with Ricky staring at her. 
RICKY Mommy, I was thinking. What's gonna happen to the tin crapper when we get our new house? 
RAY (half asleep) They're gonna flatten it out and send it to China. 
RICKY Then what? 
RAY They're gonna melt it down and make little toys out if it. 
RICKY Then what? 
RAY They'll send them back here so I can sell them at All for a Dollar. 
RICKY And you can buy me some? 
RAY That's right. 
RICKY Yes! 
38   INT. RAY'S TRAILER, KITCHEN - DAY                          38 
Ray puts out a breakfast spread of Microwave popcorn and tang. 
T.J. I'm not eatin' that again for dinner. 
RAY We just have to make it to my paycheck on Friday. 
T.J. What about Rentacenter? 
She searches through the couch cushions. 
RAY What about them? 
T.J. They said they're coming to get the furniture if they don't get a payment by 4 o'clock. 
RAY You told me that already. 
She finds change and hands it to him. 
RAY (CONT'D) Here, lunch money. 
She gives the rest to Ricky. 
T.J. Look I don't see why you won't just let me get a job with Mitch. 
RAY (to T.J.) Who's Mitch. 
T.J. He's got like this whole business he runs. 
RAY He sells pot to kids? 
T.J. No, it's computers. He works on computers. 
RAY You're fifteen, it's not gonna happen so forget it. 
T.J. That's so stupid. We're gonna lose the TV while I'm sitting in some Christmas assembly when I could be- 
RAY Your job is looking after your brother. Who's gonna take care of him? 
T.J. (going out the door) I still say we should go back to the rez, get the Horizon and kick some serious butt. 
T.J. goes out the door behind Ricky and slams it in Ray's face. 
Ray slips into her jeans and goes to the bathroom mirror to put on her mascara. She cakes it on trying to ignore the cut over her eye but keeps looking at it. Finally she stops and stares at herself. 
CUT TO: 
39   EXT. LILA'S CAMPER - DAY                                    39 
Ray pulls up in front of the camper and stops. 
The Horizon is still there and all is quiet. 
Ray gets out holding the gun and a long rope goes to the bumper and begins to tie it to the other bumper, looking over her shoulder every once in while at the camper. 
JIMMY I don't want any trouble with him, Lila. 
LILA Don't worry about it. 
Jimmy's cell phone rings. 
JIMMY This guy's been calling all morning. He's got two up at the Old Casino. 
LILA Okay. 
Jimmy takes the call. 
43   INT. ACCLAIM AT JIMMY'S GARAGE - DAY                        43 
Lila rolls up the window. 
RAY What's going on? 
LILA We gotta pick them up. 
RAY (hesitates) Where? 
LILA Not far. 
RAY Where's that? 
LILA An old casino through the woods. They used to have gambling there in the bootlegger days. 
44   EXT. CORNWALL ISLAND WOODS, OLD CASINO -    NIGHT           44 
Ray and Lila bounce through the woods to a collapsed building. An old BLACK SUV pulls up from the opposite direction, FACING THEM. 
Two MIDDLE-AGED CHINESE MEN, get out of the back. One carries an envelope. At the sight of Ray and Lila, he stops and says something to the other one. 
Both turn around and head back to the SUV. 
The DRIVER JACQUES BRUNO, a large Quebecois man, wearing a full-length fur coat gets out. They argue. He pulls out a LONG PISTOL and motions the men to the Acclaim. 
RAY What the hell is he doing? 
Ray reaches for her gun. 
LILA Keep that thing down. 
Bruno walks towards the Acclaim. 
LILA (CONT'D) Roll down the window and see what he wants. 
RAY What the hell is going on here? 
LILA Just roll it down. 
Bruno stands at Ray's window. 
Ray slides the gun under her leg and rolls down the window. Bruno hands her a Tim Horton's bag. She takes it. 
BRUNO (Quebec-French accent) D'ey don't like de women driver. 
He hands Ray the envelope of cash. 
LILA Count it. 
Ray nervously COUNTS the money as the Chinese men shiver outside. 
RAY Twelve hundred. 
Lila pops the trunk. Bruno and the Chinese men disappear around the back of the Acclaim. They hear the trunk SHUT. 
Bruno comes back to Ray's window and taps on it. 
Ray looks at Lila. 
LILA Open it. 
Ray rolls down the window again. 
BRUNO D'is will keep d'em from running. 
He hands her men's shoes and dirty socks. 
Ray takes the belongings and ROLLS up the window and drives away. 
45   INT. ACCLAIM ON FROZEN RIVER -   DAY                        45 
Ray drives across the river. The socks and shoes are between them. 
RAY Why would they want to run? 
LILA To get away from the snakeheads. 
Ray rolls down the window and tosses out their shoes and socks. 
RAY You're welcome. 
Ray swerves back out onto Route 37. 
52   EXT. ROUTE 37 INDIAN RESERVATION - SAME                    52 
They continue down the road to the reservation line. After they pass the sign: YOU ARE ENTERING THE LAND OF THE MOHAWK, Ray pulls over and stops. 
Ray takes the money and consolidates it into one paper bag. 
LILA What about mine? 
RAY We're even now. 
They stare at each other for a second or two, but Ray does not take out the gun. Lila reaches for the door handle 
Lila gets out. Ray drives away. 
53   EXT. RAY'S TRAILER YARD - DAY                              53 
The kitchen clock reads 3:55. 
A RENTAWORLD truck is parked outside. Two large RENTAWORLD MEN sit in it. T.J. sees them from inside the trailer. He comes outside. 
He walks up to the trunk. One of the men rolls down the window. 
T.J. My mom told me to give you her credit card number. 
RENTACENTER MAN (weary) We only take cash or money orders. 
T.J. Well, my Mom might be late. 
RENTACENTER MAN She's got three minutes. 
T.J. goes back inside. 
54   INT. RAY'S TRAILER - DAY                                   54 
Ricky is glued to a cartoon. T.J. watches him, checking out the window every few seconds for Ray. 
A long moment passes with only the sounds from the cartoon. 
55   EXT. RAY'S TRAILER YARD - DAY                              55 
The RENTAWORLD men get out of the car and start toward the trailer. 
From down the road the Acclaim comes roaring along, kicking up dust. 
Ray swerves in and jumps out and runs up to the men. 
RAY It's okay. I got it right here. (she waves a wad of fifties and twenties). Two fifty five, right? 
The men nod, relieved. Ray counts out the money. 
Ricky bursts out the door and runs towards Ray. 
RICKY Mommy! 
She catches him in her arms and hugs him. T.J. stands at the trailer door, watching as the men drive away. 
RAY (to Ricky) Who wants to go the Price Chopper and get some Cap'n Crunch? 
RICKY I DO! 
RAY Wanna to go to the Price Chopper? 
T.J. walks out, looking at the money suspiciously. 
T.J. Where'd you get that? 
RAY (a beat) Matt made me an assistant manager. 
T.J. No way. 
RAY Is that so hard to believe? 
T.J. It's been like two years. 
RAY Exactly, and that's why he gave me a bonus. 
He isn't convinced. 
RAY (CONT'D) Do you wanna go to the Price Chopper or not? 
T.J. gets in the car.

T.J. Where are you going? 
RAY Christmas shopping. 
59   INT. RAY'S TRAILER, BEDROOM -   NIGHT                       59 
Ray lays down her bed and checks her cell phone for new messages: a little zero blinks at her. 
She listens to her own cell phone message, 
RAY'S VOICE Hi, it's me. leave a message, and maybe I'll call ya back. 
It is harsh. She erases it and tries again. 
RAY (fake cheerful) Hi....it's me...leave a message and I'll call ya' back. 
She plays it back. It sounds fake. She tries again. 
RAY (CONT'D) (less cheerful, forced) Hey, leave me a message and I'll call ya' back. (under her breath) You son of a bitch. 
She plays it back. "You son of a..." was recorded. 
She tries again. 
RAY (CONT'D) Hi, it's me. I can't take the call right now, but if it's you, Troy, please at least tell me you are alive, because the boys are worried about you. 
She brings up OLD MESSAGES on her cell phone and listens to one. 
TROY (O.S.) Hey, I just got done here. I made two hours overtime fixing one of the snow- making machines. Pretty cool, huh? I'll be home late. I'm gonna catch that meeting at 7:30. Love you, bye. 
Ray stares across the room at a pile of Troy's dirty flannel shirts. She gets up and picks up the pile to move it to the closet, but feels something hard. From a shirt pocket she pulls out a stack of used scratch cards. 
She throws the shirts in the closet and reaches for her cigarettes. 
She takes out a glossy picture of her double wide dream home, "The Commodore" a gleaming pre-fab structure with a landscaped yard and a family with paid-for smiles. 
After a moment she takes the wad of cash out of her pocket and begins making stacks of fifties and twenties. 
60   EXT. LILA'S CAMPER -   DAY                                  60 
The camper is buried in snow. A shiny SUV pulls up out front. BERNIE LITTLEWOLF, 35, burly, well-dressed, Mohawk man gets out. 
He yells across the yard 
BERNIE Lila. Get up. I got a job for you! 
61   INT. LILA'S CAMPER -   DAY                                  61 
Lila is sound asleep on her cot under three blankets next to the propane heater. 
Bernie's snow balls THUMP against the side of the camper. 
BERNIE (O.S.) Lila! Get up. 
Lila opens her eyes and looks out the window, squinting at the snow glare. 
BERNIE (CONT'D) They got two people out sick today, so if you get down there you got the job. 
LILA Huh? 
BERNIE Get dressed, I got coffee. Let's go! 
He holds up a paper cup. 
She slips on her jeans with a sweatshirt... 
62   EXT. LILA'S CAMPER -   DAY                                  62 
Lila forces the door open against the heavy snow and steps outside. 
LILA Where is it? 
BERNIE Get in, I'll tell you on the way. 
She grabs her coat and trudges across the yard. 
63   INT. BERNIE'S SUV -    DAY                             63 
Bernie hands her a paper cup of coffee. 
BERNIE Rita said you quit. 
LILA She fired me. 
BERNIE That's not what she said. 
ROSALIE Do I have any messages? 
Lila hands her a stack. She takes them and walks away, then stops. 
ROSALIE (CONT'D) I can't read this. 
She holds the message out to Lila. Lila tries to read it, squinting. 
LILA I think it's a "T.". 
ROSALIE No, I can't read any of it. 
LILA I told Bernie I couldn't see. 
Lila grabs her jean jacket. 
LILA (CONT'D) Nevermind. I'll go. 
She walks out. 
66   INT. ACCLAIM AT BUBBLE CAMPER - NIGHT                       66

LILA What for? 
RAY I got nothing for under the tree. 
67   INT. WOLF MART GAS STATION RESTAURANT - NIGHT               67 
Ray fills the car with gas. 
Lila goes inside to get some Pringles. Looking into the small restaurant she sees Evelyn Littlewolf, her mother - in-law and Little Jake sitting at a table with Grand Chief Rosalie. 
She stops dead in her tracks at the sight. They do not see her. 
Slowly, she walks up to the table. 
Little Jake notices her first. 
ANGLE: Through the window Ray catches sight of Lila standing at the table perfectly still. 
The other women glance up at her then turn away. No one speaks. 
Lila walks off with Little Jake still watching her. 
68   EXT. FROZEN RIVER - NIGHT                                   68 
Ray and Lila drive across the smooth river surface. Snow falls steadily. The windshield wipers SNAP back and forth. 
They barely avoid the oncoming headlights of another smuggler's car crossing the ice. 
RAY Don't you people even take Christmas Eve off? 
LILA Mohawks don't celebrate Christmas. 
RAY You could fool me the way they were all lined up at All for a Dollar today. 
LILA Those are Christians. The converted. 
RAY From what? 
LILA From the Longhouse ways. 
RAY That's awful not to have Santa Claus-- for the kids, I mean. 
69   EXT. RAY'S TRAILER - DAY                                    69 
T.J. dumps the contents of a box containing the pieces of an artificial Christmas tree. Branches cover the floor. The boys begin putting it together like a puzzle. 
The TV is on. A commercial for the HOT WHEELS TECH TRACK AIR STUNT CHALLENGE SET comes on. 
Ricky trains in on it, flinching and jerking his body with sound effects at the sight of the flying Hot Wheels cars and the booming voice of the announcer. 
RICKY Daddy is gettin' me that for Christmas. 
T.J. What about Santa Claus? 
RICKY He's bringing the new house. 
70   INT.   ACCLAIM JIMMY'S GARAGE LOT - NIGHT                   70 
Ray and Lila drive up. Jimmy runs out with his jacket pulled over his head. He sees Lila and signals to the garage. 
Two figures start toward the car. As they get closer, Ray sees a man and a woman. Both Pakistani. 
Ray sticks her head out the window but the snow and the wind are too strong. She stops. 
Lila gets out with the wiper fluid. Ray pops the hood. 
Ray looks in the backseat at the duffel bag. She hesitates a moment then reaches into the back and opens the back passenger door and slides the bag out of the car. 
Lila gets back inside. 
LILA (CONT'D) What are you doing? 
RAY Nuclear power, poison gas,...you can't tell what they might have in there. I'm not gonna be responsible for that. 
Ray tries the windshield wipers. Fluid clears the windshield. 
Ray dials her cell phone with one hand. 
RAY (CONT'D) -Hi, I'm gonna be a little late.(pause) -I have to work. Is Ricky asleep? -Put him on. (pause) -Ricky listen to me, he's not coming until you go to sleep. (pause) (MORE) 
RAY (CONT'D) -No. Not yet. He's still flyin' over Canada okay? He's not even done with Canada yet, so he's not coming until you get to sleep. Now put your brother on. -I'll be home in a little while, okay? -No, I haven't got it,yet. What's it called again? -Hot Wheels Tech Trax Air Stunt whatever, right, right, I'll get it if I can! -I can't promise T.J. -There are more important things to get for Christmas this year. Be home in a little while. Okay, bye. 
RAY (CONT'D) (to Lila) You'd think a new house would be enough. 
Ray guns it up the boat launch to the shore. 
75   INT. RAY'S TRAILER -   NIGHT                               75 
In the living room, the artificial Christmas tree is up. The TV is on and Ricky is untangling a ball of red Christmas lights. 
T.J. (dials the phone) -Hi, is Mitch there? (a long pause) 
The microwave dings. Holding the phone, T.J. takes out two Hungry Man dinners and sets them on the table. 
T.J. (CONT'D) -Hi Mitch. It's T.J. No, T.J. from school. Yeah, man. Right. Uh, I was wondering if you still needed those numbers we were talking about `cause I got one. -How much? -Cool, but the thing is I don't really have any wheels at the moment. -On Moira road off 37. -Yeah, but there's one more thing...(he whispers into the phone inaudibly)...no the air stunt challenge set. -Yeah, exactly. Yeah, man. Thanks a lot. Bye. 
He hangs up and puts the dinners on the table. 
T.J. (CONT'D) (to Ricky) Ricky, time to eat. 
T.J. turns around. Ricky has wrapped himself in Christmas lights from head to toe, by slowly revolving while holding the strings. 
RICKY Hey T.J., watch this! 
He plugs in the lights and they turn on. 
T.J. Yeah, that's pretty cool. But it's gonna hurt when you sit down. 
Ricky giggles. 
T.J. (CONT'D) Now unwrap yourself, it's dinner time. 
76   EXT. BOB'S MOTEL -   NIGHT                                  76 
Ray and Lila drive to the back of Bob's. The Dealer hurries out to meet them. 
77   INT. ACCLAIM AT BOB'S MOTEL - NIGHT                         77 
He hands Ray a wad of cash. She counts it, then nods to Lila who pops the trunk. 
78   EXT. ACCLAIM AT BOB'S MOTEL -   NIGHT                       78 
The Pakistani man and woman hurry out of the trunk, looking around, and rush to the passenger door of the Acclaim, speaking frantically to each other. 
The Dealer tries to hustle them to the garage, but they won't be moved. 
Ray starts to back out, but the Dealer knocks on their window. Ray rolls it down. 
DEALER (heavy accent) They say there's a bag. 
RAY It was too heavy. We had to unload it. 
The Dealer tells the woman in Urdu. She becomes HYSTERICAL. She grabs Ray through the window and the dealer pulls her off. 
RAY (CONT'D) What's the matter with her!? 
DEALER She had something in the bag. 
The woman continues screaming in Urdu. 
RAY What is she saying!? 
He speaks to her in Urdu. 
DEALER She says her baby. Her baby was in the bag. 
The Dealer and the man hurry the wailing Pakistani woman into the garage.

RAY Come on! 
Lila follows her. 
88   INT. ACCLAIM ON FROZEN RIVER - NIGHT                        88 
Ray gets in the car and sets the bundle down on the seat, unwraps it from layers of swaddling and begins taking off it's clothes. It is a boy. 
She tries to resuscitate him, but there is no response. 
LILA It's dead. 
Ray keeps giving it air. There is no response but she keeps at it. Then, between breaths: 
RAY Tap the bottom of his feet. 
LILA Why? 
RAY That's what they did to get Ricky breathing when he was born. 
Ray puts the baby on Lila's lap. She pulls away. 
LILA I don't want to touch it. 
RAY Well, I can't hold it and drive. 
Ray cranks the heater and aims the vents at the baby. Lila stares down at the baby in her lap, not touching it. 
LILA I don't think it matters. 
RAY At least put him next to your body. That will warm him up. 
LILA But it's too late. 
RAY Just do it! We can't give it back to her cold. 
89   INT. RAY'S TRAILER - NIGHT                                  89 
T.J. closes the windows and puts a package of microwave popcorn in the microwave and turns it on. He watches it begin to smoke, then pops open the microwave and takes the smoking bag from room to room to hide the smell of burnt insulation with burnt popcorn. 
90   EXT. ROUTE 37, THE RESERVATION LINE - NIGHT                 90 
Ray pulls out onto Route 37 and passes the reservation line: "You are now leaving the land of the Mohawk" 
Trooper Napoli watches the Acclaim pass again. This time he pulls out behind it. 
91   INT. ACCLAIM ON ROUTE 37 - NIGHT                            91 
Ray notices the cruiser following her. 
RAY Shit! 
Lila looks back. 
LILA Calm down. 
Lila quickly pulls the baby near and wraps him inside her coat hiding him from sight. 
The DOME LIGHTS START FLASHING. 
RAY Oh shit. What do I do? 
LILA Calm down. Just pull over. 
RAY What if he saw us go by before. To Bob's. 
LILA He's got no reason to stop us, unless you give him one, so keep your mouth shut. 
RAY What if he searches the car. What do we say about- 
LILA He won't, just remember you're white. 
Ray pushes the blankets onto the floor and kicks them under the seat. 
92   EXT. ACCLAIM ON ROUTE 37 - NIGHT                            92

In Ray's rear view mirror, Trooper Napoli gets out of the cruiser. He puts on his hat and walks toward the car. 
Ray rolls down her window. 
TROOPER NAPOLI License and registration? 
Ray hands them over. He examines them, then leans down to the window. 
TROOPER NAPOLI (CONT'D) Could you step out of the vehicle, ma'am. 
98   INT. BOB'S MOTEL - SAME                                     98 
Ray and Lila look around the shabby motel office circa 1950s with a few threadbare chairs. No one is at the front desk. 
Ray ventures behind the desk and knocks on a small door. She carefully opens it to a small office with a desk, cluttered with papers and, beyond it, another door. Ray knocks and opens it to: 
A living room hung with heavy red Pakistani fabrics and lights. The dealer and the Pakistani man study a map of New York State spread out on the table. 
Behind them the Pakistani woman sits on the couch. 
Ray comes in, followed by Lila carrying the baby. 
RAY We found him. 
The Pakistani woman looks up, sees the bundle and hurries across the room to Lila. Lila holds out the baby with a little smile and the Pakistani woman snatches it out of her arms. 
The Pakistani women pulls back the blanket and sees the baby -- alive. She sinks to her knees letting out a wail. 
Lila's eyes fill with tears. Ray chokes back her own. 
RAY (CONT'D) (to Lila) Come on. Let's go. 
Lila follows Ray out, looking over her shoulder at the baby. 
99    INT. ACCLAIM ON ROUTE 37 -      NIGHT                      99 
Lila and Ray drive away. 
LILA He was dead. 
RAY He was just cold. 
LILA He was dead. 
RAY Okay, whatever, you brought him back to life. 
LILA That was the Great Spirit, not me. 
RAY All I know is Kmart is closed and I got nothing for under the tree. 
Lila looks at Ray. 
RAY (CONT'D) What? 
Lila says nothing. 
RAY (CONT'D) Look, I don't have time for that. I can't get deep about every little thing. I just have to keep on going. I only need one more run to have enough for my double. 
100   INT. ACCLAIM AT LILA'S CAMPER -     NIGHT                  100 
Ray and Lila pull up in front of Lila's camper and stop. Ray divides the money. 
RAY Here. 
Lila takes the money and starts to get out. 
RAY (CONT'D) Merry Christmas or whatever. 
LILA Yeah. 
Lila gets out and goes inside. 
101   EXT. RAY'S TRAILER - NIGHT                              101 
Ray drives up. The trailer is covered in Christmas lights. 
102   INT. RAY'S TRAILER, KITCHEN - NIGHT                     102 
Ray comes in. The box containing the Hot Wheels Tech Track Air Stunt Challenge set is under the tree. 
RAY What's that? 
T.J. Hot Wheels. 
She is suspicious. 
RAY Where'd you get it? 
T.J. I called a friend. 
RAY Mitch? Is that the friend you called? It's probably stolen, you know. 
T.J. No, its not. 
RAY Well, I don't want you hanging around him. That kid is bad news. 
T.J. It's not like you were gonna get it. 
RAY Look , Mister, I got more important things to worry about than toys. I'm trying to get our doublewide. 
RAY Absolutely. 
He eyes the side of the trailer where smoke stained siding is visible. 
TROOPER NAPOLI Well, you have an enjoyable Holiday. 
RAY Thanks. You, too. 
Ray stands and watches the trooper drive away. She feels in the pocket of her bathrobe for her cigarettes and fumbles to light one, sucking on it, unaware of the cold. 
When she turns around she looks at the trailer and notices the smoke-stained siding on one end of it. 
106   INT. RAY'S TRAILER - DAY                                  106 
T.J. listens at the door. Ricky looks up. 
RICKY Why is the police man here? 
T.J. Shh. 
From outside the door: 
RAY (O.S.) T.J. could you come out here for a minute. 
T.J. goes outside. 
107   EXT. TRAILER YARD - DAY                                   107 
Ray stands staring at T.J. at the trailer's burnt end. 
T.J. What did he want? Did something happen to Dad? 
RAY No. 
T.J. Then what did he want? 
She points to the blackened siding on the trailer. 
RAY Did you have a fire last night? 
T.J. The pipes froze so I fixed `um. 
RAY You fixed um? 
T.J. Yeah. 
RAY Did you happen to use the blow torch? 
She walks around back and looks underneath the trailer: a mass of charred and melted insulation. 
RAY (CONT'D) Look at this. We can't live here anymore! 
T.J. It's just a tin crapper. 
RAY No, it was our house. 
T.J. So, we're gettin' a new one, right? 
RAY Jesus, you could have killed yourself and your brother. 
She grabs the blowtorch and slams it to the ground, but it is indestructible. 
T.J. It's not yours, he gave it to me. 
She goes to the car, takes out her gun then puts the blow torch on the ground and aims at it -- but T.J. grabs it. 
RAY Put it down. 
T.J. No! 
RAY Put it down. 
T.J. Are you gonna shoot me now, too? 
RAY Put that thing down! 
He ignites the blow torch to spite her. 
T.J. Maybe he didn't like gettin' shot in his own house. Maybe that's why he left. 
RAY That was an accident. 
T.J. Some accident you shot him in the foot. 
RAY He spent the food money on scratch cards, T.J. 
T.J. So, he'd done it before. 
He aims it at her. She walks towards him. He increases the flame. 
RAY There's a hole in my bedroom floor. We gotta move. 
Lila keeps walking. 
RAY (CONT'D) I just need one more run to get the double. 
Lila keeps walking. 
RAY (CONT'D) Look you can have the Acclaim. Okay? 
Lila keeps walking. 
LILA I don't want it. 
RAY What is it then?! 
Lila keeps walking. 
RAY (CONT'D) Are you still mad about that baby? `Cause it wasn't all my fault, ya' know. I mean who puts their kid in a duffle bag? 
Lila keeps walking. Ray follows trying to figure her out. 
RAY (CONT'D) You're gonna need a lot of money to take care of a one year old baby. 
LILA I got enough. 
RAY Yeah, but you gotta get him first. 
Lila stops dead in her tracks and looks at Ray. 
RAY (CONT'D) I'll help you. You can even borrow my gun. 
Lila looks around to see if anyone is watching and gets in the Acclaim with Ray. 
ANGLE FROM BINGO PALACE ENTRANCE: The Ticket Taker watches the Acclaim drive away. 
112   EXT. ACCLAIM, VERSAILLES MOBILE HOME LOT - NIGHT           112 
Ray and Lila pull up outside the model double wide home. 
113   INT. ACCLAIM. VERSAILLES MOBILE HOME LOT - SAME            113 
Ray and Lila look at it. 
RAY You should see the inside. 
LILA How many bedrooms? 
RAY Three. And it's got a jacuzzi tub in the master bathroom. 
LILA Wall to wall carpet? 
RAY Oh yeah. But the best thing is the insulation. The pipes can never freeze. 
Ray gets out. 
RAY (CONT'D) I'll be back. 
She disappears into the Office. 
Lila looks at the house. 
114   INT. OFFICE, VERSAILLES MOBILE HOME LOT - NIGHT            114 
Ray comes in on Guy Versailles giving a young couple the hard sell. 
VERSAILLES ...what I think you'll find with the Commodore -- and you'll be the judge -- is that the vinyl wall covering is perfect for small children. There is never a need to repaint or even touch up- 
RAY I wanna schedule a delivery. 
Versailles looks up, annoyed. He plasters on a smile. 
VERSAILLES (to the couple) Give me just a second. 
He tries to take Ray aside. 
VERSAILLES (CONT'D) What do you want? 
She pulls a huge wad of cash from her jacket pocket. 
VERSAILLES (CONT'D) Is this all of it? 
RAY It's three thousand but I want it delivered tomorrow. 
VERSAILLES I told you all or nothing. 
She holds out the cash. The couple tries not to watch. 
RAY Take it as a deposit. All you have to do is show up. If I don't have the rest you keep it. 
Ray speeds towards it, but the Quebec cruiser still pursues them. 
RAY What the hell? We're on the reservation. 
LILA They can't arrest us but if they catch us they'll take the money. 
RAY Shit! 
Ray bounces into the woods through the trees. 
124   EXT. ACCLAIM ON RIVER BANK - NIGHT                        124 
The Acclaim emerges from the woods at the edge of the river. The International Seaway Bridge looms above the ice surface of the river. 
125   INT. ACCLAIM ON RIVER BANK - NIGHT                        125 
Behind them the flashing lights close in. 
LILA That ice is black out here. 
RAY Will it hold us? 
LILA I don't know. 
Ray looks at her for a moment then drives toward the ice. 
126   EXT. RIVER BANK - NIGHT                                   126 
Behind them, the Quebec cruiser BRAKES at the edge of the river. 
The Québec officer GETS OUT TO WATCH the Acclaim drive out across the ice. He radios to: 
127   EXT. INTERNATIONAL SEAWAY BRIDGE - NIGHT                   127 
A BORDER GUARD picks up the phone. He nods, then hangs up and makes a call to... 
128   INT. NEW YORK STATE CRUISER - NIGHT                        128 
Trooper Napoli hears the call on the police radio. 
DISPATCHER ...the Quebec Surete in pursuit of a vehicle with New York State plates, identified as a blue Plymouth Acclaim and the suspects are two women, suspected to be carrying illegals... 
He recognizes the car and u-turns. 
129   INT. ACCLAIM ON FROZEN RIVER - NIGHT                       129 
Ray and Lila hold their breath as they cross the river. They make it over the midpoint and Ray accelerates toward the shore. 
Two hundred feet from the bank, the BACK RIGHT TIRE HITS A CRACK in the ice. The TIRE DROPS and the UNDER BELLY of the car SCRAPES THE ICE. SPARKS FLY. 
The RIGHT REAR END of the car DROPS DOWN and the FRONT LEFT TIRE LIFTS off the ice. The car TEETERS BACK AND FORTH. 
Ray and Lila sit perfectly still. 
LILA We gotta crawl out the window. 
Lila rolls down her window. The car shifts. The wad of cash SLIDES toward the edge of the dashboard. Ray grabs it. 
Lila pops the trunk. The two Chinese girls scramble out. The four begin RUNNING FOR THE SHORE. 
ANGLE FROM THE UNDER THE BRIDGE: 
Trooper Napoli watches the action on the ice. 
130   EXT. ACCLAIM ON FROZEN RIVER - NIGHT                       130

Ray, Lila and the Chinese girls keep running, slipping and sliding, falling. Lila and Ray stop and go back to help one of the Chinese girls who keeps falling. 
When they get to the shore, they climb up the bank and collapse on the snow, gasping. 
ANGLE: Trooper Napoli gets in his cruiser and heads down the bank toward the women, lights flashing. 
132   EXT. RIVER BANK - NIGHT                                    132 
Two headlights are seen in the distance coming toward them. A PICKUP TRUCK approaches along the shore. 
Jimmy drives it. He gets out, gathers Ray, Lila and the two Chinese girls into the back of the truck and drives away. 
Ray looks back as the Acclaim SLIPS THROUGH THE ICE AND DISAPPEARS. 
Trooper Napoli reaches the scene, too late. No one is there. 
133   INT. VILLAGE BAKERY - NIGHT                                133 
A small house on the river's edge with a hand painted sign:"Bakery" Jimmy drives up. He helps Ray, Lila and the Chinese girls to the door. 
Rosalie and Barbara shoot him an ANGRY STARE. He shrugs. 
BARBARA We can expel her. 
BERNIE You can't start throwin' Mohawks off the Rez, Rosalie. There's only, what, six thousand of us as it is. 
ROSALIE She makes the Mohawk people look bad. 
BERNIE But she has a Mohawk son. 
ROSALIE She cost us a Mohawk son. 
BERNIE Jake was a big boy. He knew what he was doin' 
ROSALIE She'll never be anything but a smuggler. 
BERNIE We've had smuggling on the Rez since Al Capone. 
ROSALIE Then we'll take a vote. 
137   EXT. ROUTE 37, THE RESERVATION LINE - NIGHT               137

138   INT. VILLAGE BAKERY, KITCHEN - NIGHT                      138 
The bell on the bakery door RINGS. Billy Three Rivers walks in looking very official. Jimmy opens the door. 
JIMMY Hi, Billy. 
He comes in and Velma walks in from the kitchen closing the door behind her. 
THREE RIVERS Velma, seen any smugglers tonight? 
Velma says nothing. 
JIMMY Come on, Billy, you never bothered with smugglers before. 
THREE RIVERS Rosalie is worried people are gonna think the Mohawks let in terrorists. Plus, I got the Troopers on my back. They want the illegals and they say there's some white lady with them too. Is that true, Jimmy? 
Jimmy looks away. 
THREE RIVERS (CONT'D) You got white women doing it now? Jesus. (after a moment) Well, if you see any, let me know. 
Three Rivers leaves. 
139   INT. VILLAGE BAKERY, KITCHEN - NIGHT                      139 
Lila and Ray LISTEN from the kitchen. Ray eyes the back door. 
Ray grabs her jacket off the oven and takes half the cash out of the pocket and hands it to Lila. 
RAY I gotta go. 
Lila takes the money. The Chinese girls look on confused. One gets up and grabs her jacket, but Ray motions her back. 
RAY (CONT'D) No. You stay here. 
Ray hurries to the back door, opens it, but Bernie Littlewolf is there. At the sight of him, Ray backs up. 
He walks in. 
BERNIE Hi, Lila. 
LILA Hi Bernie. 
BERNIE You're in a lot of trouble. 
Lila looks at him, unfazed. 
BERNIE (CONT'D) The council voted to expel you. 
LILA Expel me? 
BERNIE For five years. You can appeal, but you'll never be able to change Rosalie's mind. 
LILA They can't do that. 
BERNIE They'll make your life miserable if you try to stay. 
LILA They've already done that. 
BERNIE Believe me, it could get even worse. 
RAY I thought this was all legal on the reservation. 
Bernie ignores her. 
RAY (CONT'D) (to Lila) Look, I gotta get home. 
144   EXT. HOUSE ON POINT - NIGHT                                144 
Bernie waits in the car. Lila walks to the front door. Thunder looks up from beside the front step. 
LILA (shows her empty hands) Sorry, Thunder, I got nothing for you. 
She knocks. 
Evelyn opens the door. Seeing Lila she tries to close it, but Lila WEDGES herself inside. 
145   INT. HOUSE ON POINT - NIGHT                                145 
Evelyn tires to push her out, but Lila walks in the house. 
EVELYN What do you want? 
Lila walks up to the Little Jake sitting in his high chair, his face covered in carrots. 
She reaches out to touch him, but Evelyn pushes her hand away. 
LILA I need his coat. 
Lila picks up the baby, and looks around. 
LILA (CONT'D) Where's his coat? 
EVELYN You can't have him. 
She grabs Lila's arm, but Lila shakes her arm free and wraps Little Jake in her own jacket. 
LILA Say goodbye to your Dudah. 
Evelyn stands in front of the door, blocking Lila. Lila stops and they stand for a moment looking at each other. There is anger and sadness. Evelyn moves aside. 
Lila walks out with the baby. 
146   EXT. HOUSE ON POINT - NIGHT                                146

Ray sits in the backseat. The two Chinese girls beside her. 
RAY How long is it for me. You know if I confess? 
TROOPER NAPOLI As long as they're not on a watch list. Four months. 
He glances around at them. 
TROOPER NAPOLI (CONT'D) I don't think you have much to worry about judging from the look of them, probably brought here to work in the sex trade. 
Ray looks at the two girls. 
RAY Will they get sent back? 
TROOPER NAPOLI Not necessarily. They can apply for asylum. 
RAY Can I have a cigarette? 
He lights one for her. She takes it, shaking. 
TROOPER NAPOLI Is there somebody I can call for you? To take care of your children. 
RAY I got somebody. 
He looks back at her. 
TROOPER NAPOLI A relative. 
RAY A friend. 
Trooper Napoli looks at her. 
RAY (CONT'D) But I need to call my kid. 
148   INT RAY'S TRAILER - NIGHT                                148 
The phone rings. T.J. picks it up. 
T.J. (O.S.) Hello. Hi, Mom. 
She hears his voice and can't speak. 
T.J. (CONT'D) -Mom are you there? What's wrong? -What kinda trouble? -What did you do? -A smuggler!? Holy shit! -Are you in jail? -But are you're going to jail!?

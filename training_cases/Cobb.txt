1   INT. OLD OFFICE (SANTA BARBARA, CA) - DAY (1960)          1 
The room is California Spanish, thick walls, arches, and light spills in from a mission window. But we don't have any sense of place just yet. At first there are just details. 
EXTREME CLOSEUP ON TYPEWRITER KEYS 
of an old Underwood upright, well-worn and ancient. A woman's fingertips with red nail polish are placed on the keys. They wiggle. 
CLOSE ON PIPE IN ASHTRAY Smoke curls.   A man's hand picks it up. 
CLOSE ON MAN'S HAT AND COAT on a coat rack. 
CLOSE ON WASTE BASKET Overflowing with crunched-up paper. 
MAN lies on a couch near the window. He stands up suddenly and looks out the window. AL STUMP, 40, is sharply dressed -- tie, dress shirt, cufflinks. He's staring at something. 
HIS POV - COURTYARD BELOW - BEAUTIFUL BRUNETTE 
in high heels crosses the courtyard. She glances up toward Stump, then quickly turns away and disappears. 
CLOSE ON STUMP 
He sighs, and turns. STUMP The muse has   not descended, Lucille. (off   her silence) The muse has   not descended. (off   her silence) God damn it,   Lucille, you hear me? 
(CONTINUED) 
1   CONTINUED:                                                    1 ANGLE ON LUCILLE 
The woman at the typewriter, a 50-year old steno/secre- tary, responds calmly. LUCILLE The muse has not descended. 
STUMP Yes! The muse has left me stranded here like a beached whale -- only one phrase, one word, from finishing the greatest essay I've ever written! One word, the right word -- Flaubert called it 'le mot juste' -- I ever tell you that? Lucille is a longsuffering saint. LUCILLE 'Le mot juste' -- the exact right word the writer needs to tell his story. Yessir, you've mentioned it. STUMP Hemingway, Faulkner, Joyce -- they all searched for 'le mot juste' until they cried, until they bled... LUCILLE Yessir. STUMP What is this essay about again? 
LUCILLE Fishing. 
STUMP I mean what is it really about? LUCILLE You said it was about the quote unquote primal issues of survival, man against nature, etcetera -- that's what you said. 
STUMP Ohyeah... so... we end the essay with... (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
1   CONTINUED:    (2)                                            1 STUMP (CONT'D) (dictating) 'The tarpon leaps shimmering into the late cross light of the keys, a primeval moment frozen in... (hesitates) ... frozen in'... 
Lucille types it out. LUCILLE Shimmering tarpon -- very good, Mr. Stump... (beat) ... 'frozen in' what? 
STUMP (patiently) I don't know, Lucille, that's what the Muse will tell me if she ever descends. (considering) ... 'frozen in'... 
REYNALDO Stump!   For you. Stump goes to the phone, interrupting his own "fight." STUMP (to Frank) Phone call saved your ass. Stump grabs the phone, covering an ear to hear better. STUMP (on phone) Yeah... yeah... who?... no... you're kidding?... when? Stump hangs up the phone and turns. His face registers shock, or more precisely, bewilderment and wonder. STUMP Hey... (as they ignore him) Shut up! 
They do, and give Stump their ruffled attention. STUMP Cobb wants to see me. 
MUD Cobb who? STUMP Ty Cobb!    How many Cobbs are there?! This news instantly sobers the room. 
(CONTINUED) 
4   CONTINUED:    (4)                                                4 FRANK Ty Cobb?   I thought he was dead? 
STUMP Not yet. He said he wants to tell me the real story of his life before he croaks. 
BILL You were just talking to Ty Cobb? 
STUMP The Georgia Peach himself. This impresses the hell out of everyone in the room.           Even Stump is still a little dazed. 
FRANK They say Cobb is crazy. The meanest sonofabitch who ever lived. MUD I heard he killed a man. BILL Maybe so, but -- he was the greatest baseball player of them all. CRONIES Yeah, the best, no one close, etc... 
Frank suddenly is cautionary, concerned, paternal. FRANK Listen, Al, be careful -- STUMP I ain't gettin' my ass shot, don't worry... FRANK No, not that -- the story. (beat) This is like Ivan the Terrible inviting somebody into the Czar's palace before he died. 
STUMP Except Ivan was a nicer guy... (CONTINUED) 
4   CONTINUED:    (5)                                            4 FRANK (concerned, earnest) Don't let Cobb bullshit you. This is your shot. This is all our shot. (as cronies agree) When does he want to see you? 
STUMP Immediately.

5   INT. NEARLY EMPTY MOVIE THEATER - DAY                        5 
Al Stump sits alone in the theater, except for a teenaged boy sweeping the aisles, who stops to watch the screen. STUMP (V.O.) I gathered all the film footage that existed on Cobb -- which wasn't much -- and rented the local theater for the afternoon... (beat) I, too, had thought that the great Ty Cobb had been dead for awhile... 
6   ANGLE ON SCREEN                                              6 The screen fills with (B&W) Movietone Newsreel footage of Ty Cobb, complete with overly sincere NARRATION and MUSIC. 
NEWSREEL NARRATOR (V.O.) This 1905 cameo of an 18-year-old youth shows a peaches-and-cream complexion and the piercing eyes of a lad who would become, etc... Onscreen (B&W) -- Cobb as a young ballplayer followed by images of Cobb's famous batting stance, Cobb clowning, etc. STUMP (V.O.) His reputation as being difficult at best, psychotic at worst, preceded him. But if there was one thing I knew after all my years as a journalist covering politicians, celebrities, and sports heroes, it was this -- (CONTINUED) 
6   CONTINUED:                                                    6 Onscreen (B&W) -- Cobb with children, Cobb with celebri- ties, Cobb in a parade honoring him, and always, Cobb's dashing, swashbuckling style of play. STUMP (V.O.) The 'facts' -- and public perception of those 'facts' -- frequently bear little resemblance. Onscreen (B&W) -- Cobb in action -- His demon fury gives way to the fierce joy of his playing. He slashes a ball up the alley, turns first and never hesitates at second, and as the relay comes into third -- 
STUMP (V.O.) One thing was beyond argument -- he was the most brilliant athlete of his time... perhaps of any time. (beat) I was determined to find out who was the real Ty Cobb. Cobb slides with spikes high and a cloud of dust. There is something thrilling and terrifying in the image. CUT TO: 
7   EXT. MOTHER LODE COUNTRY (CALIFORNIA) - LATE AFTERNOON        7 Stump's car, a late model Buick, moves across the stunning grasslands at the western base of the Sierra Nevadas. We begin hearing his voice, then see him inside the car driving. DISSOLVE TO: 
8   EXT. FOOTHILLS OF THE SIERRAS - DUSK                          8 
Stump's car heads up into the darkening mountains. STUMP (V.O.) They said Cobb owned property all over the country, but in recent years had been staying in his hunting lodge at Lake Tahoe in the Sierra Nevadas. 
9   AERIAL SHOT - LONE PAIR OF HEADLIGHTS                         9 
moving up into the Sierras, into rugged terrain and thick forests.

10   INT. CAR - DUSK                                             10 Stump straining to see the road, a bit wary of this drive. 
STUMP (V.O.) Driving into the Sierras at night with winter coming on wasn't the smartest decision I'd ever made but it seemed better than being late for my first meeting with Cobb. First drops of rain begin hitting the windshield -- Stump hits the wiper button and the floppy blades begin ineffectively wiping the windshield. Stump struggles with his vision. 
STUMP Shit... 
POV SHOT THROUGH WINDSHIELD A dismal, wet and obscured view of the mountain road, climbing higher into the Sierras. A small roadside gas station comes INTO VIEW, and -- Stump pulls his car into the station. CUT TO: 
STUMP Mr. Cobb? The silence is shattered by a SCRATCH, then VIOLIN MUSIC from upstairs. STATIC suggests a record is playing. 
17   ANGLE ON STAIRS                                                17 Stump climbs the stairs with caution -- Until he's just outside the half open door from which light spills. He hesitates... STUMP Hello?   Mr. Cobb? A GUNSHOT RINGS OUT -- Ripping through the door.       Stump is terrified -- he gasps for air. STUMP Thank you very much, Mr. Cobb, but I don't need this job that bad. 
Stump turns and creeps back toward the stairs, but -- ANOTHER GUNSHOT RINGS OUT -- SHATTERING a hanging LAMP. 
Stump freeses one more time.     Silence.   Then the voice -- COBB Yes, Mr. Stump -- you do need this job that bad. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
17   CONTINUED:                                                      17 COBB (CONT'D) (beat) Now come in here and meet the great Ty Cobb. (calmly) I won't hurt you. 
Stump breathes deeply and steps into the doorway -- He does it as if there's no choice, accepting his fate. And sees: 
18   POV SHOT - TY COBB                                              18 Lying in bed in a robe. Unshaven. Bottles of booze and food everywhere. And bottles of pills sit on every surface. Two hunting dogs sit on the bed with him. A small record player sits next to he bed. A record spins, filling the room with FRITZ KREISLER VIOLIN SOLOS. He places the gun on      his night table, knocking pills and bottles to the floor      with a crash he barely notices. When he speaks it is      without a snarl, without threat -- simply, even sweetly,      he says: COBB On the violin -- Fritz Kreisler. I'm a great admirer of his. I'm also a great admirer of yours. 
BACK TO SCENE 
STUMP Thank you. 
COBB But you are a hopeless romantic and only a moderate success. 
STUMP Sir, I am the most successful sportswriter in America and not merely a 'moderate success.' 
COBB Of course. (beat) Give me those pills over there. 
(CONTINUED) 
18   CONTINUED:                                                     18 Stump retrieves some pills that Cobb is pointing towards. Cobb washes down a handful of pills with a bottle of Scotch. Momentarily revitalized, Cobb hands Stump a folded letter which Stump opens to read. COBB That's an invitation to a testimonial dinner at the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York. You're taking me there -- when is it? 
STUMP (looking at the letter) A few weeks. 
COBB All the great ones will be there -- The great Mickey Cochrane will be there! Hornsby, Sisler, Ott, the Waner Brothers... we used to have some parties, Stump, I'll tell ya that right now... (beat) We can't forget. STUMP I won't forget. 
COBB Look at me closely, Al... (with utmost sincerity) Lie after lie has been written about me -- my whole life I've been misunderstood. (beat) You're gonna tell the real story of Ty Cobb. STUMP What's the 'real' story? Cobb climbs slowly out of bed.     His words are reasoned and not without passion. 
COBB That's why you're here. (beat) See, there's two kinds of writers. The kind that spin endless yarns about small subjects... that's you. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
18   CONTINUED:    (2)                                                 18 COBB (CONT'D) (beat) Or... there's the kind with one great subject that consumes them forever. (beat) That could be you. Because I am that subject. Cobb hobbles to a table in front of a window. The table is covered with pills, bottles, needles, and booze. COBB (suddenly bellowing) Jameson! Get your ass up here! 
Cobb grabs another bottle of booze and swigs deeply, liquor spilling over him. Then, suddenly, he holds up his hand. A calm comes over him as -- He stares out the window into the snowy woods.       His rage has quickly turned into a quiet, intense, unsettling focus. STUMP You okay? COBB Mmmmmm... 
19   POV SHOT - WOODS IN MOONLIGHT                                     19 
near the lodge. A bank of snow -- and a large buck moves INTO VIEW. 
20   CLOSE ON COBB'S FACE                                              20 His eyes light.     A flare in his nostrils.    A twitch.     And utter calm. 
BACK TO SCENE 
Jameson, the man in the suit, arrives and stands in the back of the room. He takes notes when Cobb speaks. JAMESON (MAN) Sir? 
Cobb continues staring out the window at the buck. (CONTINUED) 
20   CONTINUED:                                                         20 COBB There's a small oil company near Bakersfield called Honolulu Oil, sitting near the Elk Hills Reserve... (beat) I want you to buy all the stock you can. JAMESON Honolulu Oil? 
COBB Getty is expanding in the west, looking for companies like that. I got a hunch... (beat) Stumpy, c'mere... Cobb picks up the revolver and holds it lovingly. Stump crosses and stands behind Cobb, sharing the view. COBB I can take that buck.     What'ya think? STUMP With a pistol? No way. Cobb smiles and loads the revolver.       He pushes the window which swings slowly open. 
21   POV SHOT - BUCK IN MOONLIGHT                                       21 searches for leaves to eat in the snow.          Serene.   Unaware. 
BACK TO SCENE 
STUMP You're not treating me like a writer -- you're treating me like a stenographer. 
BLAM! A SHOT RINGS OUT -- Stump types quickly, hunting and pecking with two fingers, reading aloud. 
STUMP Know ye that a prince and a great man has fallen this day... COBB It has a certain ring to it... STUMP Yes it does. COBB I thought you might like it. It's yours, a gift from me. (beat) 'Cobb, a prince among men, misunderstood in his genius, as genius always is' - (demands from Stump) This is the second line from what will be the greatest biography of a great man ever written -- type it! Cobb checks the tape and suddenly is deep in thought over some information coming across. Stump types. 
COBB Bethlehem Steel's about to dive. 
Cobb grabs a phone and dials -- Then barks into the phone. COBB (on phone) Jameson. Bethlehem's going in the toilet. Dump it all! Cobb slams down the phone, momentarily lost in finance. 
(CONTINUED) 
26   CONTINUED:    (3)                                                26 STUMP You got a stock tip for me? 
COBB Yeah... buy Coca-Cola. We're about to go out in cans. 
STUMP Coke in cans?    I don't think so. Cobb just stares back in disdain.      Then, suddenly -- 
Cobb starts coughing terribly. He clutches his torso as if it were about to fall into pieces. 
COBB You know what's wrong with Ty Cobb? STUMP What? COBB (proudly) Every disease known to man -- I got 'em all! And they'll never get me in a hospital -- never! (beat) My heart leaks -- the doctors who are nothin' but a buncha hacksaw artists give me Digoxin to keep it pumping... Cobb grabs a bottle of Digoxin pills and flings it across the room in a rage. He flings bottles of pills as he recites his ailments. 
COBB They give me Darvon for the cancer in my back, they give me Tace for something eatin' up my stomach, Fleets Compound for an infection in my bowels, Librium for my tension, insulin for my diabetes... 
Cobb grabs a hypodermic needle and awkwardly pours from a bottle into the chamber. Insulin spills as he does. COBB Fuckin' insulin... 
He jams the needle wildly into his arm without hesitation. (CONTINUED) 
26   CONTINUED:    (4)                                              26 He takes a deep breath as if the drug has produced an immediate relief from pain. 
COBB And if all that wasn't enough, it's been two years since I got my pecker in the air... (beat) The South may not rise again but my dick will. 
The PHONE RINGS. COBB (barks) I ain't here! 
Stump answers the phone. STUMP (answering the phone) Cobb's residence... hello. (beat) He's not here -- who's calling? Ernie? Ernie who? (his face drops) My God... (to Cobb) It's Ernest Hemingway... for you. COBB Tell him to go to hell! Stump covers the receiver nervously. STUMP Jesus  Christ, Ty, this is the great  American writer -- this is the  man who inspired me to become  a writer! 
COBB Tell him to go to hell anyway. STUMP Why? 
COBB Him and me used to be pals but we went on a hunting trip once and he hired a shitty guide. 
(CONTINUED) 
26   CONTINUED:    (5)                                              26 STUMP That's it? You didn't like a guide he hired? Cobb looks at Stump with a fierceness that is so over- whelming, so physical, that Stump melts. 
COBB You tell him to go fuck himself or I'll kick your Yankee ass! 
Stump is terrified.    He reluctantly uncovers the receiver. STUMP Mr. Hemingway? Mr. Cobb says... to go to hell. (awkwardly) By the way I'm a big fan of yours -- CLICK, a hang up. Cobb settles into a chair, letting the drugs and pills and booze work their way into his thick body. COBB Hemingway isn't a bullfighter -- he wrote about bullfighting. What the hell is that?! (beat) Bullshit... Damn painkillers... Cobb rubs his head -- The drugs are taking effect. STUMP Ty, you okay? 
COBB It'll pass... (increasingly woozy) Stumpy, listen to me -- you know what I need? 
STUMP What do you need? COBB I need a woman. (muttering to sleep) A woman is definitely what I need... 
(CONTINUED) 
26   CONTINUED:    (6)                                            26 And Cobb drifts to sleep in his chair, momentarily overcome with painkillers. 
Stump stares at the sleeping volcano of a man, and when Cobb starts snoring heavily, he rises, pulls on a coat, scarf, and hat, and heads out the door.

37   CLOSE ON COBB                                                37 He laughs, cackling madly at Stump.

Stump's car creeps along the edge of a deep ravine that plunges to a raging, icy river. The car fishtails, straightens, and continues on, slowly groping down the mountain. 
40   CLOSE ON STUMP                                               40 
Sheer terror. It takes his full powers of concentration to keep the car on the road. STUMP (to himself) He's a goner, Al, save your own God damn ass... (CONTINUED) 
40   CONTINUED:                                                  40 CLOSER ON STUMP 
He sees something. 
41   EXT. HIGHWAY                                                41 
His car lights reveal tire tracks in the snowdrifts on the highway. The tracks skid wildly, clearly out of control, and head straight off the road. 
42   ANOTHER ANGLE                                               42 Stump stops his car and gets out -- He hurries to the edge of the road where the bank drops away quickly. 
POV SHOT - COBB'S CAR lies nose down at the bottom of a snow-filled ravine, thirty feet away. The tail lights are still on. The car is totalled. 
BACK TO SCENE STUMP Cobb! Stump plows his way on foot down the embankment, fighting bad footing and snowdrifts, until -- He arrives at the car -- Surely nobody could survive this. With difficulty, he makes his way to the back door of the huge car and wrestles it open. 
Stump sticks the top half of his body into the car. STUMP Cobb? 
Cobb lies upside down, ass in the air, his face buried under the dash of the car. There's blood on his face. 
COBB It's about fucking time you got here! STUMP You've alive? 
Cobb struggles to right himself, twisting and turning free.

42   CONTINUED:                                                    42 COBB I wouldn't call it living but it'll do. Help me outta here. Stump helps Cobb back out of the car.    It is an awkward, clumsy, difficult task. 
STUMP There's blood! COBB Of course there's blood! I just put my head through the windshield of a car, what the hell ya think, ya big fucking jerk. 
STUMP Shut up! COBB Ty Cobb can't die like this! They'll bury me and nobody'll know who it is! 
STUMP I said shut up. Stump drags Cobb awkwardly through the snowbank back up to the highway. When they get to the edge of the high- way, Cobb stops to stare at the tire tracks leaving the road. COBB Look't that! No guard rail! I'm suing the State Highway Commission, I'm suing the Governor, I'm suing every God damn body! (outraged) I coulda been killed! STUMP God damn it, shut up and get in the car! The blizzard swirls around the two men, now at Stump's car on the highway. 
COBB Gimme your keys, I'm driving. 
STUMP I'm driving. (CONTINUED)

Young Cobb surfaces in the river and waves his arms in triumph. His pals shriek with delight and embrace him at his courage. 
COBB (V.O.) ... it was the greatest thrill in my life not counting the first time I saw a woman naked...

51   INT. CAR IN BLIZZARD - DUSK                                    51 
Cobb and Stump continue racing down the mountainside. COBB My father died in a terrible accident, you know. STUMP No, I didn't, really... COBB Didn't you do your research on me before you came up here? STUMP I didn't have time... I mean, I knew the basics. 
COBB Then you've read that I'm the meanest bastard of them all? 
STUMP People have said that, yes... 
COBB I don't care what people think. STUMP Then why do you care what I write? 
COBB I am who I tell you I am!   Why are you making things so complicated?! 
STUMP That's what writers do.

51   CONTINUED:                                                     51 COBB Well writers oughta make things simple! Everything's complicated enough as it is. STUMP (mutters) Maybe you're right! COBB Of course I'm right! 
Stump suddenly looks up and shouts in terror. STUMP Ty! 
A snow-covered truck in the middle of the road, broken down and abandoned, is on top of us. STUMP Godddddddd! Cobb spins the wheel -- The car spins out of control, just missing the truck, and hurtling on down the icy highway. COBB Don't shout like that, Stumpy -- it just increases my tension. I saw that truck all along -- you think I'm gonna hit a truck when I'm getting close to finding me some women? Stump is in sheer terror by this time. 
COBB My father was murdered, y'know. STUMP Your father was murdered? COBB I mean that's the sort of thing you're looking for, isn't it? (beat) Murdered on the balcony of his own house... the house I grew up in...

In the b.g., the gabled house in the moonlight. A small light spills from a second- floor window onto the balcony. A man on the balcony porch moves toward the window from which light spills. 
The man pulls up the window and -- KABLAM! A SHOTGUN BLAST rips the silence and darkness. The man falls on his back. KABLAM!   A second SHOTGUN BLAST takes off his head.

How come nobody knows about this? COBB The oldtimers in Royston know about it. Nobody else's business. It happened when I was 17, a few days before Detroit called me up. STUMP But this helps explain why -- He catches himself. 
COBB Why I'm such a prick? Ha! (laughs) That's too easy -- you're a better writer than that -- STUMP Was the killer ever caught? 
COBB There was an arrest, a trial, and an acquittal. Nobody was ever convicted. 
STUMP Jesus Christ --

(beat) The only thing that finally matters is a man's accomplishments and I must say, in all humility, Al, in all humility -- I was the greatest ballplayer of all time. Nobody is even a close second. 
BACK IN DUGOUT More money is wagered. 
PITCHER Stretches and delivers -- Cobb takes off for third.       The throw is high -- he slides in safely. 
IN STANDS 
Bets are doubled. The stands are full of wagering. The whole ballpark is like a giant saloon -- drinking, smoking, wagering -- and the game is played by thugs and brigands. 
COBB ON THIRD 
Yells at the pitcher and Catcher.

55   CONTINUED:    (4)                                             55 COBB You want in on the action? My mother has a better arm than you! (to the Catcher) I'm coming to you, greaseball! Coming to kick your dago ass! 
CATCHER steals a glance at Cobb who takes a menacing lead off third. The Catcher gives a signal to the pitcher. 
PITCHER 
nods, winds up, and as he does -- Here comes Cobb with a recklessness beyond reason. And as the pitch arrives in the Catcher's hands, the Catcher digs in to take on Cobb -- Cobb slides spikes high, flying above the earth, his back leg slashing his spikes like knives. It is a slide of utter defiance and violence, a slide intended to harm. A vicious collision between Cobb and the catcher -- blood and dust. The ball rolls free. Safe. 
Cobb and the catcher immediately start punching and in seconds, a brawl breaks out, both benches clearing. As the police rush out to break up the brawl... COBB (V.O.) In those days you didn't hold hands and dance with the men on the other teams. They were the enemy -- you fought with 'em. (beat) And I was the most hated man in baseball. 
56   EXT. PHILADELPHIA BALLPARK - DAY (B&W)                        56 
Cobb enters the stadium through the dugout. The crowd rises to boo Cobb. The boos are overpowering. Cobb warms up in front of the dugout. The boos are deafening. The vindictive threats are ceaseless. 
FAN #1 You're a shit, Cobb! (CONTINUED)

FAN #2 I hate your guts, Cobb! Cobb tips his hat and speaks easily to the fan. 
COBB A good day to you, too, sir... The police escort Cobb to right field -- the roar of the vitriolic crowd increases. COBB (V.O.) Do you know what it's like to be booed like that? 
Cobb in right with the cops -- the crowd on its feet, booing so loudly that the air is all one giant, wailing moan of hatred. COBB (V.O.) It feels wonderful! They couldn't live without me! They came to the ballpark to see me! 
57   INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT (B&W)                                  57 
Cobb opens a stack of mail -- a police chief and subor- dinate officers are with him. 
CLOSE ON MAIL Cut-out letters read:    "COBB - YOU'RE DEAD" 
Cobb puffs on a cigar defiantly as he reads his hate mail. COBB (V.O.) Fifty thousand fans trying to kill me everywhere I went! 
58   EXT. PHILADELPHIA BALLPARK - DAY       (B&W)                   58 
Armed police patrol the stands looking for snipers as Cobb plays the game in right field surrounded by police. 
The booing increases -- fans truly hate him.

The woman turns to confront the two men.     Now we see her. On a fabulous platinum-blonde wig is stuck    a yellow slicker-type rain hat. The ear flaps are     awry, the platinum-blonde wig curls up around it --    the effect is thrilling.

CLERK Aw, c'mon, you always want a discount, Mona. 
RAMONA (WOMAN) Ra-mona... and the mattress is always lumpy -- 
Cobb pulls out a bottle of pills and washes a handful down with a deep swig from a pint bottle of whiskey. The Clerk looks on with alarm. STUMP Excuse me, I've gotta get him checked in. He's very sick. 
RAMONA We're all sick in the eyes of God -- but some of us still have manners. 
She whirls and leaves the lobby, leaving the three men. STUMP Two rooms, next to each other.

CLOSE ON COBB 
His face looks terrible, drawn, drained. 
Cobb reaches into his pouch and pulls out a bundle of cash and security notes, tied neatly with a string.

STUMP Your gun's okay, too... right here... 
And Stump hands Cobb his beloved pistol, which Cobb takes with great affection and comfort. Stump helps Cobb into bed, covering him with a blanket. The gun and the money sit on the pillow next to his head. Cobb speaks with great pain just before he passes out from pain, drugs, and exhaustion. COBB We haven't missed the testimonial dinner, have we? STUMP No we haven't missed the dinner... COBB Good, good... Cobb manages a small, pained smile before drifting off into sleep. Stump turns off the light and exits.

STUMP (on phone) Hello? Happy Birthday! It's your Daddy! Yeah! (beat) Your birthday was yesterday?! No, it couldn't be! 
Stump quickly checks a calendar on the wall and realizes he's missed his son's birthday. (CONTINUED)

When I get off the road we'll do something special -- a late birthday, eh? Maybe you can go to spring training or something with me, eh? Yeah... (beat) Listen, is your mother there? (beat) I know she doesn't want to speak to me, but I want to speak to her. (waits for answer) Okay, okay -- I feel terrible about the birthday... I'll call you real soon. And tell your mother I'm not drinking anymore. Okay... 'bye, 'bye... Stump hangs up the phone -- Takes a deep breath, and... He pours another drink, and sits down to his typewriter. STUMP Fuck it... Stump is hunkered over his typewriter pounding away.       His VOICE OVER indicates what he is writing. STUMP (V.O.) I was a fool for thinking Cobb's brilliance might be what I needed at this moment of my life... Ty Cobb was the last thing I needed. (beat) He was not misunderstood -- he was understood perfectly well. He hated blacks, he hated Jews, he hated Catholics -- he hated everything except himself and his own view of the world... (beat) At times it seemed like he would drop dead in front of me... (beat) ... and other times he seemed indestructible... (MORE) (CONTINUED)

A BOTTLE CRASHES against the headboard jarring Stump to consciousness. He looks up to see: Cobb reading the pages in a rage.     He tears them as he does. COBB 'Pathetic, paranoid, lost in the past!' What is this shit?! 
Stump awakens slowly, disoriented, amidst a shattered bottle. STUMP Those are my notes!   You can't look at my notes! COBB You're notes -- my life! You're gonna betray me, you son of a bitch! STUMP You want the truth?   I'm gonna tell the truth! (CONTINUED)

STUMP Mine, for crissakes, I'm the writer! 
COBB But I'm the legend and legends are not pathetic! 
STUMP No, I do. 
RAMONA All this ambiguity -- I see why she's divorcing ya. Stump, completely befuddled, lets down completely. He doesn't care about getting laid or drunk or anything for the moment, except having someone to talk to -- the some- one is Ramona. 
STUMP I don't know what I'm saying or doing anymore... I'm trying to speak my heart. RAMONA Oh God... STUMP I told my wife I wanted a divorce. She said 'okay' -- then I realized maybe I don't. RAMONA Then go back to her. STUMP No. 
RAMONA Then quit crying. You want a divorce, you don't want a divorce, you're asking marital advice from a woman you're trying to get in the sack -- Jeez Louise! 
STUMP I'm not myself. 
RAMONA Who is? A sigh.   Stump is lost.    He motions to the bartender.

RAMONA You being paid? 
STUMP Very well. RAMONA Then it's not a lie. It's a job. Quit agonizing -- take the money, do what you gotta do, and get it over with. STUMP I can't. RAMONA Then quit. STUMP No! 
RAMONA For godsakes why not? Stump has to think about this for a while. 
STUMP He knows greatness. I'm in the presence of greatness. I want to learn about greatness. She looks at him like he's crazy. 
RAMONA Greatness is overrated. STUMP Maybe you're right, maybe you're right... RAMONA So what do you want? 
Stump drinks deeply -- his heart needs alcoholic reinforcement. (CONTINUED)

She grabs his vodka and takes a swig from the bottle. STUMP Wait, wait... don't drink too much. RAMONA Ya think I won't be able to screw if I'm too drunk? STUMP Well... yeah... 
RAMONA Screwed, stewed, and tattooed! She laughs a hearty laugh, letting it all out. 
STUMP C'mere... I want to hold you. 
RAMONA You're so thoughtful -- the others are trying to get me drunk and you're trying to keep me sober.  You'd be good husband material. STUMP Not so fast --

RAMONA I'm not a whore. 
STUMP Shh, shh... I know, I know... A moment of quiet, simple bliss -- when: 
The door bursts open -- the LOCK SPLINTERS with a CRASH, and: Cobb bursts into the room -- Full of rage. 
COBB You two-timing bastard! You God damn Judas Iscariot! You stealing my girl! I'll kill you! STUMP She's not 'your' girl! And Cobb lashes out at Stump -- Stump tries to block the blow, but Cobb is relentless, and Cobb hits him again. 
Stump falls backwards -- His head hits a corner of the table. RAMONA What're you doing?! And Cobb backhands Ramona across the face, knocking her down. 
Stump lies on the floor only half conscious. He grabs his head. Blood. The room swirls in front of him as -- 
THROUGH the open door -- Stump rises to his feet, feels his head, and groggily staggers out. Blood on his hand. 
Stump feels his way past a couple doors, listening in, unsure which room is Cobb's until a booming voice -- COBB (O.S.) Ramona! Stump hurries to Cobb's door and listens in to be sure.

COBB A thousand dollars... He holds out the money for her. 
RAMONA Do what you gotta do and get it over with, Mr. Cobb. 
Silence. Cobb takes a big, sloppy hit from a bottle, throwing in a few pills for good measure. COBB I want you to tell everyone you meet that you fucked me and I was the best fuck you ever had. RAMONA That's all? COBB That's a lot. RAMONA For a thousand bucks?    Hell yes. He reaches out and straightens her wig which is pretty crooked by now. She lets him. Then he falls apart, vio- lently grabbing his crotch. COBB I'm looking at the most beautiful woman in the world, do you hear me?! 
Cobb grabs his crotch with the violence he does everything. COBB And I'm dead down here! Dead! Nothing! And it's been like that for over two years! Nothing! Now get outta here before I hit you! 
Cobb lashes out at Ramona -- a vicious right hand.         She ducks as his fist slams through the headboard. RAMONA Georgia Peach my ass -- Georgia trash is what you are! (CONTINUED)

Cobb sits at the foot of the bed, thoroughly flustered. Stump helps him into his bed where he curls up with his money and his gun, barely conscious. 
COBB She was a great piece of ass, Stumpy, best I ever had... 
STUMP Good, good... COBB Have we missed the Testimonial Dinner? STUMP No we haven't, Ty... now get some sleep... Stump tucks Cobb in his bed as the old man drifts into sleep, turns off the light, and heads back to his own room. 
CLOSE ON COBB asleep. Even in sleep, dying, he is twitching and full of fragments of unspent energy. STUMP (V.O.) He slept for days. I thought he was gone for sure. But even in sleep he was restless and in motion, a fire always burning in his belly...

COBB (into recorder) And then this fat ass named Babe Ruth came into the league and damn near destroyed the game of baseball... We all thought he was gonna eat and fuck his way outta the league but he hung around for a few years -- STUMP 'Hung around'?

As the benches clear -- Cobb races not at the pitcher but straight to right field where The Babe is charging in like a rhino straight for Cobb.

Stump slips his hand to Cobb's lower back just as they arrive at the door, and the two men enter together. 
COBB Thank you, my friend... And Cobb is met by the Hall of Fame director, CHARLES, 50, who shakes his hand and shows him in. 
CHARLES Hello, Mr. Cobb, good to see you again. And they head inside. CUT TO:

The great old players keep coming up to him, renewing old acquaintances. The first is WAHOO SAM CRAWFORD, 80's, a contemporary and at one time both teammate and adversary of young Cobb. CRAWFORD Sam Crawford, Ty, Long time no see. COBB Good to see you, Sam.   You doin' okay? CRAWFORD I'm alive, Ty, I'm alive... 
COBB The boys'll get together later and have a little party, eh?

COBB Stumpy, meet Rogers Hornsby, next to me the greatest hitter of all time -- 
HORNSBY How d'ya do.   You're looking good, Ty... 
COBB I look like shit and you know it. We'll have a real smoker later, eh? 
HORNSBY Ohyeah... we'll tear it up good... The EMCEE raps a fork on a glass, bringing the dinner to order. 
BASEBALL M.C. Welcome to Cooperstown, ladies and gentlemen. We're here to acknowledge the greatest ballplayers of all time, those men still gracing our presence who were among the earliest inductees into the Hall of Fame. (beat) Waner, Hubbell, Foxx, Cochrane, Hornsby, Traynor -- these are the giants, the Old Masters of our craft... 
The spotlight moves around the room and each man waves, half rising from his chair. 
BASEBALL M.C. But the greatest of all is with us tonight -- simply put, the best ballplayer ever -- Tyrus Raymond Cobb. 
A spotlight hits Cobb, who rises and waves to the crowd as the lights dim. 
BASEBALL M.C. We have gathered from the archives some film on Mr. Cobb... lights, please...

STUMP That's all. 
COBB I was raised in the Baptist Church but I know that Heaven is just the ol' oskefagus -- the change-up. You swing from your ass 'cause you think life is a fastball down the middle and after your bat has crossed the plate and you're all off balance and looking stupid, the ball just kinda flutters across home, slow and juicy and hittable, and as it crosses the plate, the ball looks at you and smiles a nasty smile and laughs its way into the catcher's mitt...

Cobb marks the margin of the manuscript. STUMP (V.O.) He loved the manuscript, as well he should -- it made him out to be a saint -- Cobb looks up from the manuscript. 
COBB Greatest biography ever written -- STUMP (V.O.) The book, like Cobb, was almost finished. But he was dying slower than I was writing, and like everything else, he viewed it as a competition that he was not going to lose. 
CLOSE ON COBB Sweating, pale, hanging on.    A grim smile. STUMP (V.O.) To me, we weren't riding to Georgia in a limo... (beat) We were riding in a hearse...

139   EXT. DOWNTOWN ROYSTON - DAY                                139 The limo moves slowly and ominously through the town. Old folks, black and white, sitting on chairs and benches in front of the stores, under awnings, stare at the strange sight of a limo cruising slowly. STUMP (V.O.) It wasn't exactly the 'grand re- entrance to a home town' that he talked about...

Stump walks away from the car and from Cobb.     Some wind blows, and the threat of rain. STUMP I wish you'd die! COBB I will, Stumpy, I will... Cobb is out of the car on his cane -- following Stump. STUMP And go to hell! A line of lightning signals a storm in the distance. COBB Oh, I'll do that, too. (beat) And look how convenient you've made it. 
They look up -- The entrance to the Royston Cemetery.        A casually-maintained slope of several acres up a hill. 
STUMP That was your sister alright, and she didn't want anything to do with you either! 
COBB I forgive her. Stump walks into the cemetery to escape Cobb, who follows nonetheless with a cool resolution. Stump laughs at Cobb's comment. (CONTINUED) 
143   CONTINUED:                                                     143 STUMP You forgive her?! That's rich! 
COBB (following along) Forgiveness is crucial to human maturity and religious growth. 
STUMP Religious growth?! 
COBB We all need to forgive more, Al... you oughta try it. You're too angry. You're all pent up. 
STUMP I'm angry? Through the cemetery they keep walking, up a long hill full of tombstones and shrines and sprays of dead and dying flowers and gaudy plastic bouquets. Cobb following steadily along with his cane, several paces behind Stump. 
THUNDER shakes the ground.     And more lightning. COBB Are you angry because I discovered you were a whore? Is that it, Alimony? STUMP I'm angry?! 
COBB Is it the divorce?    You gotta let go of it... 
STUMP I love her!   I don't want a divorce! 
COBB Sure ya do. You're just so used to accommodating people that you don't know what you want anymore. I accommodate nobody. Stump whirls near the top of the hill to face Cobb who continues making his way along, slowly and surely. 
STUMP But you have no friends! (CONTINUED) 
143   CONTINUED:    (2)                                           143 COBB Do you? Who are they?! Those drunken hacks you hang out with who all think they're gonna write the great American novel but all they're gonna ever do is bitch and moan and write lousy leads about high school football games? How about the brunette in the courtyard? Is she your friend? I heard she fucks everybody -- she must be everybody's friend! A mausoleum looms behind Stump, bigger than anything in the cemetery, classical, outsized, monumental, even elegant. One simple word is above the door, carved in granite: COBB. COBB I'm glad we're here -- I was gonna bring you here anyway sooner or later -- Stump turns to see the mausoleum, and the word COBB. STUMP Which Cobb of Georgia is that? Several beats as the men take it all in.      Finally: COBB (with pride) That is me. 
And rain suddenly falls from the skies, threatening to soak the two men. 
Cobb heads for the mausoleum -- Stump follows. CUT TO:

Stump is still fuming, angry and cynical. STUMP Under one roof? That's romantic! You want that in the book? Ty Cobb brings the family together at last to enter the gates of Heaven whole! 
COBB You mock my family -- you mock me. Cobb grabs Stump by the throat and stares him in the eye. COBB My father was a great man! STUMP Then why are you such a bastard? 
COBB Being a bastard is a small price to pay for greatness. I, too, am a great man. 
STUMP Let me go! 
COBB My mother didn't kill my father. STUMP What're you talking about? Cobb's fist clinches Stump's throat, forcing him to hear. Outside the mausoleum, RAIN pours down now, a Southern spring thunderstorm unleashing torrents. 
COBB My father told my mother he was leaving town for the weekend but he came back to the edge of the woods where he tied up his horse... CUT TO: 
145   EXT. MOONLIT ROAD THROUGH SOME WOODS - NIGHT (B&W)             145 A horse shakes its head, attached to a buggy. 
A man starts through the thinning woods. COBB (V.O.) ... because my father thought my mother was being unfaithful to him... 
Cobb puts down the gun, struggles to the door and answers it. 
A MAN stands in the rain, carrying a briefcase, trying vainly to keep dry. MAN WITH BRIEFCASE Al Stump? 
COBB In here. (CONTINUED)

MAN WITH BRIEFCASE Mr. Al Stump? Stump nods as he swigs on the bottle. 
MAN WITH BRIEFCASE I've been chasing you all over the country -- (opens his briefcase) -- I'm here to serve you papers. STUMP Papers? 
COBB I'm afraid it's divorce, Stumpy. I know this routine. MAN WITH BRIEFCASE You're being sued for divorce. 
STUMP But my wife and I are still talking?! COBB Yeah, and what she's saying is 'fuck you.' STUMP Fuck me? Well fuck her.     No, fuck him. Stump reaches for the gun and aims it at the man. 
STUMP You ain't serving me no papers. 
The Man is frozen with terror as Stump rises from the chair -- drunk and crazed, aiming the shaky gun. MAN WITH BRIEFCASE I'm just doing a job. 
STUMP I love my wife. 
COBB We all loved our wives, Al, that's got nothing to do with it. (CONTINUED) 
149   CONTINUED:    (3)                                             149 MAN WITH BRIEFCASE You'll find somebody else. 
COBB There's a million broads out there, Stumpy -- put down the gun. 
KABLAM! Stump FIRES at the man but the shot goes wild. He's drunk, he's not experienced with guns, he's shaking. STUMP I am not going to accommodate this man, Tyrus. COBB You're all mixed up.   Give me the gun. STUMP You're absolutely right, Tyrus, I've been accommodating people my whole life and it stops right here. (beat) You've killed a man. I'll kill a man. KABLAM!   KABLAM!   He misses again. 
The Man drops to his knees, begging for his life. MAN WITH BRIEFCASE No! Please, dear God! I have a family, too! STUMP Don't give me that sob-sister stuff! Stump tries to hold the gun with two hands, approaching the man, to nearly point-blank range. 
COBB Al... no... Al... Al... 
Stump looks crazed, a bathrobe falling open, his feet bare and wet, his hair awry from the rainstorm. He aims the gun at the man's head, looks at Cobb with wild glee. (CONTINUED) 
149   CONTINUED:    (4)                                             149 STUMP Life is too short to be diplomatic. A man's friends don't care what he says or does. You're my friend, Ty, right? You're my friend! 
COBB No! Stump pulls the TRIGGER -- CLICK.     Empty. 
As the Man looks up, realizing he's alive, Stump strikes him across the face with the gun, drawing blood. 
The Man scrambles to his feet and races from the room, grabbing his briefcase, and running to the door. MAN WITH BRIEFCASE You're crazy! No wonder she wants to divorce you! You're crazy! And the Man runs into the rainy night, leaving Cobb and Stump. Stump's head collapses in his hands -- Bewildered, exhausted. The two men sit alone for several beats before Stump speaks. He is completely lost. STUMP I almost killed a man. COBB A little drunken excess... STUMP No. I put a gun to a man's head and pulled the trigger. I wanted to kill him. 
COBB It's forgotten already. I saw nothing. Nothing happened. 
STUMP Yes it did. COBB Al, listen to me. (MORE)

149   CONTINUED:    (5)                                            149 COBB (CONT'D) If I was hired to write a biography of the greatest sportswriter of our time -- a biography of Al Stump -- would I include what happened tonight? Attorneys are pigs -- divorce attorneys are lower than pigs. What happened tonight was private. An intimacy. Your own business. Our own business. Nobody else's. It wouldn't belong in a book about greatness. STUMP Nobody's gonna write my biography. COBB And when the brunette in the courtyard brushed against you, I know what happened, Al. A warm summer breeze, the smell of jasmine, her black hair against a white blouse -- you came to life again, you got hard -- and when you saw her naked it was more than you could bear... it's okay, Al, it's okay... (beat) The brunette ain't gonna be in the book either... Stump looks up at Cobb but says nothing. He picks up a nearly-empty bottle off the floor and takes a hit. COBB And the drinking? Well, they used to say ol' Ty had a drinking problem but you can booze me right under the table right now... no problem... and nobody's God damn business, either... Stump raises his hand, motioning Cobb to stop. 
STUMP I get it... I get it... A moment.    A look. 
COBB Then get some sleep.   You look pathetic.

149   CONTINUED:   (6)                                            149 Stump crawls on the bed toward the pillows with the stupid grace of a drunk looking for a key under the mat. 
CLOSE ON HIS FACE 
Something's not right. Cobb removes the gun momentarily and looks at it. 
He sees that the gun barrel is covered with blood. COBB Dear God... 
152   COBB                                                           152 rushes into the bathroom and faces the mirror.      Blood gushes from his mouth as he coughs again.

as he stares into the mirror. COBB No... no... no... this can't be... Absolutely not... This is not right... Cobb coughs again -- More blood covers his chin. He touches his chin, touches the blood, smears it around a little, looks at his hands now covered with blood. COBB (terrified) Stumpy?! No... 
Cobb moves around the tiny bathroom like a caged animal. He falls to his knees in prayer in front of the sink. COBB Our Father, which art in heaven, hallowed by Thy name. Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, on Earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive -- (beat) Aw, fuck it... little late for that sob sister stuff... Cobb rises to his feet and looks in the mirror again. He grabs a hand towel and daubs his face with it. A bit more blood trickles from his mouth. And gradually a deep calm seems to settle over him. COBB ... so this is what it feels like... 
153   COBB                                                            153 
returns to the bedroom and sits down on the edge of the bed, next to Stump who continues his deep, drunken sleep. Cobb picks up the phone and dials as he continues mopping his chin with the towel. He speaks with great calm.

Can you please prepare your finest room for me? Tomorrow morning would be fine. Cobb hangs up and leans back on the bed next to Stump who is still deep in drunken sleep. One man sleeps deeply, the other just sits there. DISSOLVE TO:

STUMP'S POV - COBB'S BED 
is empty and still neatly made.

Stump sits up with a start. He is suddenly, by circum- stance, awake and alert, though he looks like hell. He's also alarmed -- something is wrong.

Three holes of broken plaster and mirror. STUMP (O.S.) God... 
BACK TO SCENE He rushes to the fireplace where only embers now glow. He sees something -- 
STUMP'S POV 
The "real" manuscript scattered around the floor near the chair. Nearby, the bathroom door is open. Stump hurries into the bathroom and stops cold. Blood is on the sink and on the towels. A note is on the mirror. He pulls the note down and reads it.

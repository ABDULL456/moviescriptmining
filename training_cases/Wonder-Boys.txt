THE WONDER BOYS 
WONDER BOYS 
BASED ON THE NOVEL BY MICHAEL CHABON 
Screenplay/Steve Kloves 
January 21, 1999 (Pink Revision) January 15, 1999 (Blue Revision) December 18,1998 
All IS A BLUR. . . 
...then WORDS appear, twisting and vaguely transparent, reflected on the window GRADY TRIPP stands before as he reads from a sheaf of NEATLY-TYPED PAGES. 
GRADY 'The young girl sat perfectly still in the confessional... 
1	INT. CLASSROOM - UNIVERSITY - AFTERNOON 
Grady--45-year-old novelist, professor, and insomniac--is in the midst of reading a story to the dozen college STUDENTS who make up his Advanced Writing Workshop. 
GRADY ...listening to her father's boots scrape like chalk on the ancient steps of the church, then grow faint, then disappear altogether.' 
As he finishes, GRADY ponders a PAIR of MAINTENANCE MEN, perched on ladders in the quad below, stringing a LARGE BANNER between two bare trees. The BANNER reads: 
WELCOME TO WORDFEST 
GRADY turns, peers at his students. They look as if they've been on a field trip to the DMV. 
GRADY (cont'd) (a wave of the pages) So. .Anyone? 
A GIRL with jet-black hair turns to a PALE YOUNG MAN sitting at a desk in the back of the classroom. He is JAMES LEER, 19. Like GRADY a moment before, he is staring out the window. 
CARRIE MCWHIRTY Let me get this straight. The girl with the big lips is depressed because, each night, when her father goes off to work at the bakery, her mother sneaks some mysterious lover into the house. Not only does this girl have to listen to her mother working this guy in the next room, she has to wash the sheets each morning before Daddy gets home. After a few weeks of this, she starts to go a little nutty/ so Daddy takes her to confession--only, once she gets in the box, she gets a whiff of the priest and realizes he's the mother's secret lover. Is that it? 
James Leer says nothing, huddling lower in the PATTY OVERCOAT he wears. 
CARRIE MCWHIRTY I mean, Jesus. What is it with you Catholics? 
GRADY All right. Let's try to keep it constructive, shall we? Howard, what about you? 
HOWARD I hated it. 
GRADY That's not exactly what I meant by constructive, Howard. 
HOWARD I think James should try to be more constructive. This is my second semester with him. His stories are brutal, man. They make me want to kill myself. 
GRADY glances at James, but his face remains impassive. Then--with a visible sense of relief--GRADY notices the raised hand of the achingly beautiful HANNAH GREEN. 
GRADY Yes, Hannah? 
HANNAH GREEN I think maybe we're missing the point. It seems to me James' strength as a writer is that he doesn't take us by the hand. He treats us like adults. He respects us enough to forget us. That takes . . . courage . 
GRADY nods, smiles subtly. Appreciative. 
GRADY Well put, Hannah. And a good note to end on, I think. (as the students rise) Don't forget about WordFest this weekend. And remember: those of you driving V.I.P.s to tonight's cocktail party need to have them at the Chancellor's house no later than 5:30. 
Hannah Green gathers her things, pauses by Grady. 
GRADY Thanks for that. He all right? 
HANNAH GREEN I think so. ..What about you? 
GRADY Me? Sure. Why? 
HANNAH GREEN Just checking. 
GRADY watches her glide away in her CRACKED RED COWBOY BOOTS, then starts to exit himself. 
JAMES LEER Turn out the light, please. 
GRADY pauses, studying the wan figure sitting at the back of the classroom, then--reluctantly-hits the switch on the wail, leaving James Leer alone in the DARK. 
2	INT. STAIRWELL/CORRIDOR - AFTERNOON (MOMENTS LATER) 
GRADY hurries down the steps, then spies SARA GASKSLL, 45, standing below. She is talking to a BOY with an armful of SLICK PROGRAMS. 
SARA (calm but firm) No, Elliot, I said five hundred programs for today. This means we have no programs for the weekend. This means that tomorrow morning, at 9AM, several hundred people will walk into Thaw Hall and have absolutely no idea where they are going. (shaking her head) It's all right, Elliot. I'll take care of it. 
GRADY watches Sara take the programs, turn, and spot him. There is the slightest of hesitations, then.... 
SARA Professor Tripp. 
GRADY Chancellor. 
SARA I got the message you called. 
GRADY I got the message you called too. 
This hangs in the air, awkward somehow, then both nod and continue on, without so much as a backward glance. 
3	INT. GRADY'S CAR - MOVING 
8	INT. GRADY'S CAR - MOVING - LATE AFTERNOON                8 
As the Galaxie emerges from a TUNNEL, GRADY watches the great city of Pittsburgh reveal itself in the distance, then glances in the rearview mirror. 
GRADY That perfume you're wearing, Antonia. It wouldn't happen to be Cristaile, would it? 
MISS SLOVIAK Why yes. How did you know? 
GRADY Lucky guess. 
CRABTREE You didn't actually purchase this car, did you. Trip?? 
GRADY It was Jerry Nathan's. He owed me money. 
CRABTREE He owes God money. You know, he queered himself for good with Esquire. 
GRADY takes a joint from the ashtray, snaps a Scripto butane. 
GRADY He said something about being between things. 
CRABTREE Yeah, between a bookie and a pair of broken legs. 
9	EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER 
A YOUNG WOMAN with a crumpled PITTSBURGH STEEIERS UMBRELLA exits the building and-seeing GRADY parked in front of a fire hydrant--stops, a puzzled expression on her face. As she approaches, GRADY roils down the passenger window. 
GRADY Hi, Tanya. (to the others) This is Tanya. My wife's secretary. 
CRABTREE and MISS SLOVIAK smile and nod. Tanya smiles and nods back, her eyes passing uneasily over Grady's joint. 
TANYA Grady.. ..Emily's not here. 
GRADY just smiles, nods. 
TANYA (cont'd) Is there anything I can do for you? 
GRADY watches a tiny stream of water trickle through Tanya's sad umbrella. 
GRADY You're leaking, Tanya. 
Tanya nods--at a loss-then turns away into the rain. 
CRABTREE Trip? ? 
GRADY She left me. Crabs. 
CRABTREE Left you...?  Who? Emily? 
GRADY This morning. I found a note in the kitchen. 
CRABTREE But. ..why didn't you say something, Tripp? I mean, what are we doing here? 
GRADY gazes at the glittering scene beyond his windshield, turns on the ignition. 
GRADY I thought maybe I made it all up. 
10	EXT. GASKELL HOUSE - EVENING 
Through the windows, a rabble of writers, faculty and select students can be SEEN, mingling under a haze of cigarette smoke. GRADY brings the Galaxie to a lurching halt across the street, parks in front of another fire hydrant. As the trio steps out. MISS SLOVIAK notices a GREENHOUSE, shimmering quietly in the chill night air. 
MISS SLOVIAK That's a nice greenhouse. 
GRADY It's Mrs. Gaskell's. Her hobby. 
CRABTREE I thought you were Mrs. Gaskell's hobby, Tripp. 
GRADY Piss off, Crabs. I lost a wife today. 
CRABTREE Oh, I'm sure you'll find another. You always do. 
11	EXT. FRONT PORCH - GASKELL HOUSE 
As the front door swings open, Sara Gaskell appears, riding a wave of jagged party CHATTER onto the porch. 
SARA Well, hello, everyone. Terry, good to see you again. 
CRABTREE Chancellor. Don't you look ravishing. 
SARA Aren't you sweet to say so. I was beginning to wonder if you were ever going to--oh! 
As Sara steps forward, her heel-catches and she pitches forward ...into Grady's arms. 
GRADY Easy there. 
SARA I'm sorry. It's these goddamned shoes. I don't know how anyone actually walks in these things. 
MISS SLOVIAK Practice. 
Sara looks at Miss Sloviak, a faint glitter of scientific curiosity in her eye. 
SARA I don't believe we've met... 
Poe noses blindly through a forest of legs, pauses by Miss Sloviak's high heels and scores a Rye Krisp. Crabtree, returning with a pair of DRINKS, tiptoes around him, finds MISS SLOVIAK chatting with a trim MAN in his 50's. 
CRABTREE Walter! I see you've met my friend. 
WALTER GASKELL Yes . She' s charming. 
MISS SLOVIAK (taking her drink) Walter's been telling me the most fascinating things about Marilyn Monroe and. ..who was it? 
WALTER GASKELL Joe DiMaggio. Simply put, Antonia, it' s my contention that their marriage tapped into the very id of American popular culture. Joe DiMaggio represented, metaphorically speaking, the Husband as Slugger.. And, though it may be controversial, I personally believe every woman, in some way, desires to be Marilyn Monroe. 
MISS SLOVIAK Oh, I couldn't agree more. 
NEW ANGLE 
GRADY works his way through the crowd, spies Walter, and changes course. Directly ahead is an oddly commanding MAN ("Q"). From the behavior of the people in his vicinity it's clear he is someone of interest. Presently, he is putting the make on Hannah Green. 
Q And while my latest has been on the New York Times bestseller list for 40 weeks, I can't help but lament that my first book, which contains what I consider my finest writing, was remaindered in less than five. So, I find myself conflicted. 
GRADY Ask him if he's conflicted about his house in the Hamptons. 
HANNAH GREEN (brightening) Grady. 
Q eyes GRADY over his wine glass. 
Q Hello.. .Professor. 
GRADY Q,. Hannah's had two stories published in The Paris Review. You'd best dust off the 'A' material for her. 
As GRADY moves off, he sees Poe sniffing, and goes the other way, heading directly into the crosshairs of a MAH IN TWEED, who is talking to another, shorter MAN. 
MAN IN TWEED (to short man) A supermarket for the mind, my ass. I'm telling you, they're nothing but a big, fat mob laundry. Have you ever been to Davenport, Iowa? Let me tell you, they need a 30,000-square-foot bookstore like they need another goddamn cow. (as GRADY passes) Grady! 
GRADY Hello, Nathan. 
MAN IN TWEED My God, I haven't seen you since, what? The PEN/Faulkner Awards. That was a big night for you, Grady. (to his friend) GRADY was there for Arsonist's Daughter, 
The short man blinks, impulsively takes Grady's hand. 
SHORT MAN Douglas Triddly, Amherst. I kid you not when I say Arsonist's Daughter belongs in the pantheon of late twentieth century fiction. I've had it on my Graduate Studies syllabus three years running. 
GRADY (pulling away) No wonder it's still in print. 
As GRADY flees, he passes a WOMAN holding a cigarette. 
WOMAN WITH CIGARETTE ...can take my word for it, writer's are lousy fucks. Poets aren't bad, but then you've got to deal with the sweater thing. They'll discover the cancer in your heart every time, but God forbid they find a decent dry cleaner. 
14	EXT. REAR GASKELL HOUSE - NIGHT 
GRADY comes out the back: door and ferrets a JOINT from his pocket, lights it. He takes a long draw, walks around the side of the house. As he passes a window, a VOICE accosts him. 
MAN'S VOICE There you are. 
GRADY starts, but when he looks through the window, he sees that the VOICE belongs to WALTER GASKELL and the person to whom he's talking is Sara. They are standing in the kitchen, near an elaborate WINE RACK. 
WALTER I could swear I had a '63 Chateau Latour in here. You haven't seen it, have you? 
SARA I doubt I'd recognize a '63 Chateau Latour if I was sitting on it. 
WALTER You'd recognize it if you tasted it. 
SARA I doubt it, darling. 
WALTER (angling & bottle to the light) Well, Q certainly will. And, given that he will be addressing 500 people in little over an hour... 
SARA You want to keep him happy. 
WALTER If he' s happy. . . (kissing her as he exits) I'm happy. 
As Walter goes, GRADY studies Sara as she stands alone in the quiet little room, looking small and tired. Finally, she takes a breath, steeling herself, and moves off, returning to the clamor inside her house. 
GRADY sighs, guilt-stricken, then detects a FLICKER of LIGHT coming from the darkness beyond. A FIGURE is watching him from the retaining wail that leads to the Gaskell's garage. GRADY blinks, chagrined that he's been caught eavesdropping, then his eyes narrow and he steps off the porch. 
GRADY James? 
James Leer wears the same nasty overcoat from class, a GREEN KNAPSACK hanging off one shoulder. GRADY looks at what appears to be a sliver of moonlight in James' palm. 
JAMES LEER It's fake. 
James' face betrays his own fragile chagrin and GRADY peers more closely at what lies in his extended hand. The sliver of moonlight is, in fact, a shiny PEARL-HANDLED PISTOL. 
JAMES LEER It was my mother's. She won it in a penny arcade in Baltimore when she was in Catholic school. 
GRADY It's very convincing. 
JAMES LEER It used to shoot these little paper caps, but they don't make them anymore. The caps. 
GRADY reaches for the gun, but James closes his fingers and slips the tiny thing back into his overcoat. 
JAMES LEER It's just. ..for good luck. Some people carry rabbits' feet... 
GRADY ...You carry firearms. 
GRADY Yea, James. 
JAMES LEER What are we going to do with... 
James glances in the backseat, where Poe lies, strange blue eyes gleaming. 
GRADY I don't know. I'm still trying to figure out how to tell the Chancellor I murdered her husband's dog. 
JAMES LEER You? 
GRADY Trust me, James, when the family pet's been assassinated, the owner doesn't want to hear one of her students was the triggerman. 
JAMES LEER Does she want to hear it was one of her professors? 
GRADY I've got tenure. 
19	EXT. PARKING LOT -- THAW HALL (CAMPUS) 
As sporadic APPLAUSE wafts from the high windowpanes of Thaw Hall, GRADY leans into the Galaxie's trunk, creates a space between the tuba and a ZIPPERED SUITCASE. 
GRADY Okay. 
James totters forward, arms hooked under Poe's front legs looking like a sorry marathon dancer. GRADY frowns, limps forward, and takes the hind legs. 
JAMES LEER He's still a little warm. 
They lay him down, push him deep into the trunk--until there is a SOUND like a pencil SNAPPING. 
JAMES LEER Yuck. 
GRADY grabs Crabtree's garment bag, frisks the pockets. 
JAMES LEER That's a. big trunk. It fits a tuba, a suitcase, a dead dog, and a garment bag almost perfectly. 
GRADY (searching) That's just what they used to say in the ads. Come on, Crabtree, I know you're holding... 
JAMES LEER Whose tuba is that anyway? 
GRADY Miss Sloviak's. 
JAMES LEER Can I ask you something about her? 
GRADY She is. Ah. Here we go... 
GRADY unravels a pair of boxer shorts, finds an airplane- size bottle of JACK DANIELS, then grabs another pair of boxers. 
JAMES LEER Oh. So. Is--is your friend Crabtree-- is he-- gay? 
GRADY Most of the time he is, James. Some of the time he isn't. Now what do we have here? 
GRADY rattles a prescription bottle, then shakes out a pair of WHITE PILLS, each etched with a tiny numeral 3. 
GRADY Looks like ...our old friend Mr. Codeine. That should take the pinch out of my ankle. (handing the bottle to James) Have one. 
JAMES LEER No thanks. I'm fine without them. 
GRADY Right. That's why you were standing in the Chancellor's back yard twirling that little cap gun of yours tonight.  You're fine, all right, you're fit as a fucking fiddle. 
GRADY opens the tiny bottle of Jack with his teeth, drinks down two number 3's, then looks at James. 
GRADY I'm sorry, James. I'm sorry I said that. 
Recklessly, James takes a pill, tosses it in his mouth, and tips back the tiny bottle of Jack. Half a second later, he spits it all out. GRADY looks down, peels the soggy pill from the lapel of his jacket. 
GRADY How 'bout we try that again. 
20	INT. AUDITORIUM - LATER 
On the stage. Walter Gaskell stands alone at a podium. 
WALTER ...really needs no introduction. Walk down the aisle of any airplane or by the pool of any hotel and you'll see his face beaming back at you. You all know the name, you all know the books, so welcome if you will, the man those of us who know him simply call.. .Q. 
As the audience THUNDERS, GRADY and James slink into the auditorium. It's standing room only. As they head for an open space against the back wail, GRADY squeezes past a KID with a GOATEE .who regards him warily. 
Q Good evening. 
GRADY stares, over the gleaming sea of heads before him, watching as Q pauses, ..for a very long moment... waiting until the auditorium is consumed in a heavy, anticipatory hush. Finally, he speaks again. 
Q I am a writer. 
As the audience EXPLODES with glee, GRADY frowns. He glances to his right, sees James' left brow crinkled with a similar look of bafflement. 
Q (cont'd) As a writer, one thing you learn is that everyone you encounter has a story. Every bartender, every taxi driver, everybody has an idea or a. story that would make a "great book" or a "great movie." Presumably, each of you has an idea. (gestures to the audience) But, how do you go from there to here? How do you go from having an idea to having a book? How do you get across? What is the bridge, the bridge that allows you to walk on air from the shoreline of inspiration to the terra firma of accomplishment? Faith. Faith that your story is worth the telling, faith that you have the wherewithal to tell it, faith that the carefully woven structure you create won't collapse beneath you... 
GRADY glances at James, sees that his eyes are unblinking and glazed, then sees, beyond him, Sara standing by the far EXIT. A blink later, she is gone. 
Q (cont'd) ...and faith that when you get to the other side someone will be waiting who gives a damn about the tale you have to tell. 
GRADY leans back, listening to the BEATING of his own HEART, the soft GLIMMER of the chandeliers hanging by a thread forty feet above his head... 
Abruptly, James LAUGHS OUT LOUD--some private amusement: bubbling up from the bottom or his brain and out into the auditorium. As Q looks and four hundred other heads turn, James ducks down--mortified. Crabtree, sitting a few rows away, studies James with amusement, then winks at Grady. 
As they make for the restrooms, Sara and GRADY appear. 
JAMES LEER This is so embarrassing! You guys had to carry me out. 
GRADY Is he ail right? 
CRABTREE (rolling his eyes) He's fine. He's narrating. 
JAMES LEER We're going to the men's room. Only we might not make it in time. 
SARA Terry CRABTREE and James Leer. Leave it to you to make that mistake, wait here. 
As Sara heads off after James, GRADY turns toward the lobby...directly into the hostile gaze of Miss Sloviak. 
MISS SLOVIAK I need a ride. 
GRADY I'm your man. 
24	EXT. STREET 24 
As the Galaxie's big trunk yawns open. MISS SLOVIAK stares at what's wedged up against her suitcase. 
GRADY There's an explanation. 
MISS SLOVIAK raises an eyebrow and then, leaning in, unzips her suitcase. 
25	INT.    GRADY'S CAR - MOVING 
As GRADY drives, MISS SLOVIAK finishes with the top button of a man's shirt, then reaches into the zippered COSMETICS BAG in her lap. Onto the open tray of the glovebox, she places a JAR of COLD CREAM, a BOTTLE of NAIL POLISH REMOVER, and a cloud of COTTON BALLS. 
MISS SLOVIAK Couldn't he have just thrown a shoe at the poor thing? 
GRADY James is. ..I don't know... 
MISS SLOVIAK Disturbed. And when your friend CRABTREE gets done with him, he's going to be even more disturbed. 
GRADY I'm not sure that's possible. 
MISS SLOVIAK Sure it is. 
GRADY watches MISS SLOVIAK peel the wig from her forehead. 
GRADY Listen, Antonia-- 
MISS SLOVIAK Tony. Now that I'm home. 
GRADY Tony. I'm sorry if things didn't work out so well for you tonight. With Terry. 
MISS SLOVIAK Forget it. I should've known better. Your friend is just, I don't know, into collecting weird tricks. Mind? 
Tony angles the rearview mirror toward himself. 
GRADY He's writing his name in water. 
MISS SLOVIAK What's that? 
GRADY Like most editors, he really wants to be a writer, but he's too busy living a novel to bother writing one. 
MISS SLOVIAK That sounds like a fancy excuse for being a shit. 
GRADY He'd call it habit. But now. ..I get the feeling he's going through the motions a bit. 
Tony peels off a pair of false eyelashes, blinks. 
MISS SLOVIAK You mean because his career's ruined and all? 
GRADY Jesus. Is that what he told you? 
MISS SLOVIAK He said he hasn't had a success in ten years and everyone in New York thinks he's kind of .a. . . 
As Tony re-sets the rearview mirror, GRADY gets a glimpse of his own swollen eyes. 
MISS SLOVIAK ...loser. But I'm sure your book is so good that he'll be able to keep his job. 
Hearing this, GRADY looks troubled. MISS SLOVIAK points. 
MISS SLOVIAK (cont'd) Turn here. 
26	EXT. SLOVIAK HOUSE 
GRADY pulls in front of a small brick house. On the front lawn, a small statue of the BLESSED VIRGIN stands under a little white BAND SHELL painted with stars. 
GRADY That'' s nice. All we have is a Japanese beetle trap. 
MISS SLOVIAK It's a bathtub. What she's standing under. 
The PORCH LIGHT conies on and a SMALL, WHITE-HAIRED MAN squints through the screen door. 
MISS SLOVIAK There's Pop. (turning) Let me see it. The gun. 
GRADY reaches into his pocket, hands it over. Tony smirks. 
CRABTREE Huh uh. A jockey. His name's, um, Curtis.. .Curtis Hardapple. 
GRADY Not Curtis. 
CRABTREE Vernon, then. Vernon Hardapple. The scar's are from a--from a horse. He fell during a race and got trampled. 
GRADY And now he's addicted to painkillers. 
CRABTREE He can't piss standing up anymore. 
GRADY He lives with his mother. 
CRABTREE And he had a younger brother who . . .was . . . a. . . 
GRADY Groom. Named Claudell.  And his mother blames Vernon for his death. 
CRABTREE (stumped) Because. . .because. . . 
JAMES LEER (sleepily) .. .he was killed, when a gangster named Freddie Nostrils tried to shoot his favorite horse. He took the bullet himself. 
GRADY and Crabtree turn to look at James Leer, who opens one bloodshot eye to regard them. 
JAMES LEER Vernon, over there, was in on the hit. 
James' eye closes. CRABTREE looks over at Grady. 
CRABTREE That was good. 
GRADY He heard everything we were saying. 
Just then, Hannah Green bounces up in her red boots. 
HANNAH GREEN Come on. Teach. I want you to dance with me. 
30	INT. DANCEFLOOR - MOMENTS LATER                          30 
GRADY and Hannah, reflected in bits and pieces in the jack 'o lantern wail of MIRRORED TILE, slow-dance to a sexy, measured blues. 
HANNAH GREEN I've been re-reading Arsonist's Daughter. It's so beautiful, Grady. So natural. It's like ail your sentences always existed, just waiting around in Style Heaven, or wherever, for you to fetch them down. 
GRADY I thank you. 
HANNAH GREEN And I love the inscription you wrote to me. Only I'm not quite the downy innocent you think I am. 
GRADY I hope that isn't true. We need all the downy innocents we can get. 
GRADY spies the corner table, watches CRABTREE say something to Q and then, casually, stroke a lock of hair from James Leer's forehead. 
HANNAH GREEN So what are you going to do? 
GRADY Do? 
HANNAH GREEN I just mean, I--I guess Emily isn't going to be there when you get home. 
GRADY looks down into Hannah's translucent face, then catches a glimpse of himself in the fractured, wail. The tile that would reflect his head is missing. 
GRADY Are you holding me up or am I dragging you down? 
Hannah snuggles closer, lays her head on Grady's chest. 
HANNAH GREEN Shush. 
31	EXT. PARKING LOT - HI-HAT CLUB (2 AM) 
Grady, limping on his bad ankle, carries James to Hannah's rumpled RENAULT, props him against the fender. 
GRADY Look, Hannah. When you get him home ...make sure he's ail right. Before you leave. Okay? 
HANNAH GREEN I would if I knew where I was taking him. 
GRADY Hannah, are you telling me you don't know where James Leer lives? 
HANNAH GREEN Some apartment somewhere. But I've never seen it. 
GRADY That strikes me as odd. 
HANNAH GREEN James is odd. I know he has an aunt in Sewickley Heights. I dropped him there once, but... (remembering) Come to think of it, it-wasn't even his Aunt's house. He said she worked there. Or something. I don't remember. 
James MUMBLES, starts to slide onto the hood of the car. 
JAMES LEER Mmhmmm.. . . knap ...sap.... 
GRADY What's he saying? 
HANNAH GREEN His bag. You know that ratty green thing he's always carrying around. He must've left it inside. 
GRADY Hh-uh. Last time I saw it was... 
GRADY glances at the idling Galaxie across the street. CRABTREE and Q huddle inside. 
GRADY Shit. He must've left it back at Thaw. In the auditorium. 
GRADY Wait here. I'll be right back. 
CRABTREE Where would we go? 
34	INT. LOBBY 
The JANITOR, the same shaggy-haired kid GRADY saw rigging the WordFest banner earlier, is struggling with a balky FLOOR WAXER as GRADY steps up to the double doors and slaps his hand against the glass. 
JANITOR It's open. 
GRADY pushes on the door and it opens. 
JANITOR (cont'd) Hey, Professor Tripp. (off Grady's look) Traxler. Sam. I took your class freshman year. Then I dropped out of school. 
GRADY I hope it wasn't my fault. 
TRAXLER (taking him seriously) No. I guess you're here for the backpack. 
GRADY Oh.. .yeah. 
35	INT. AUDITORIUM 
The knapsack is sitting on one of the metal folding chairs as Sam and GRADYenter the silent hail. 
TRAXLER I saw the manuscript inside. So when you showed up, I figured. . . 
GRADY lifts the knapsack, peers inside. There is no title page to the MANUSCRIPT, Just the words The Love Parade and then, halfway down, TEXT. 
TRAXLER Is it good? 
GRADY (reading) I don't know. It might be... 
36     CUT 
37	EXT. THAW HALL - NIGHT - A MOMENT LATER 
GRADY steps outside, closes the flap of the knapsack and, hunching his shoulders against the cold... stops. 
Crabtree. Q. The car. Gone. 
38	INT. TRAXLER'S HONDA - NIGHT 
Traxler gives GRADY a ride in his Honda, one of the original Hondas best suited for sidewalk driving. The backseat bulges with a huge AMPLIFIER and BASS GUITAR. 
TRAXLER Say, Professor Tripp, is ail that stuff true about Errol Flynn? How he used to put coke on his dick. To make himself, you know, like, last longer? 
GRADY Christ, Traxler. How the hell should I know? 
TRAXLER Well, jeez, you're reading his biography, aren't you? 
Sam points and GRADY glances at the knapsack riding on the seat between him and Sam. A BOOK'-bearing ERROL FLYNN'S PICTURE--IS tucked into the side pouch. 
GRADY Oh, right. Yeah, that's true. He used to rub ail kinds of things on it. Paprika. Ground lamb. 
TRAXLER Sick. 
39	EXT. SASKELL'S HOUSE - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 
Sam brings the car to a coughing idle across the street from the Gaskell's house. 
TRAXLER Wow, check out that greenhouse. Is that your wife? 
GRADY gazes at Sara, a .vaporous blur in the greenhouse. 
GRADY No, my wife's out of town. 
Just then, the Honda FILLS WITH LIGHT. HEADLIGHTS loom, then a POLICE CAR sweeps into the Gaskell's driveway. Walter appears on the front steps. 
TRAXLER (cont'd) Who's that guy? 
GRADY Her husband. 
Traxler looks anxiously at the police car. 
TRAXLER What exactly are we doing here, Professor Tripp? 
GRADY (staring at Sara) Taking the long way home. 
39A	EXT. GRADY'S HOUSE - NIGHT - A LITTLE LATER 
As Traxler drives away, GRADY mounts the porch with James Leer's knapsack hanging from one shoulder. He reaches above the door, feeling for a key, but his fingers come away with only dust. He stands, dispirited, then an idea strikes. He takes the doorknob, turns it. It opens. 
40	INT. .HALLWAY - GRADY'S HOUSE 
GRADY enters, closes the door quietly behind him. 
41	INT. LIVING ROOM 
The room is dim but the TV is on, throwing crazy slashes of light onto the wails and ceiling. As GRADY limps by, he finds a sleeping Hannah Green, bundled in a blanket, T- shirt, and little else. On the floor, near her dangling hand, Woolf's A Common Reader lays open next to a Diet Coke. GRADY considers the smooth geography of her body, but his eyes 'are most powerfully drawn to. ..her feet. He steps forward, lifts the blanket gently, but finds-to his disappointment--only the red cowboy boots. 
He picks up the remote, turns off the TV, and exits. 
GRADY I don't know... (unconvincingly) Me. 
GRADY drops the basket at the check-out counter and, abruptly, finds himself face to face with a BABY, lolling on the shoulder of the woman before him. The baby is staring, spellbound, at a display of...Q'S LATEST PAPERBACK. GRADY frowns, then detects the true source of enchantment: a spray of SHINY MYLAR GIFT BALLOONS. 
A thought evolves. 
GRADY (cont'd) (the balloons) What do you think of these? 
James takes another chug from his jug, nods. 
JAMES LEER Nice. 
51	EXT. GASKELL HOUSE - MORNING 
Grady, squinting through the ten-inch panel of cleared ice on the windshield, roils slowly up onto the curb in front of Walter and Sara Gaskell's house ...then off. 
52	INT. GALAXIE - CONTINUOUS 
GRADY pops the glovebox, takes out a PEN, and scratches something on the GIFT CARD attached to the BALLOON. James glances briefly at a plump ZIPLOC OF POT stashed in the glovebox, then peers at the house. 
JAMES LEER (the house) Isn't this...? 
GRADY Hm. 
GRADY gets out, then pauses, glancing at the giant orange juice jug between James legs. It's about half-down. 
GRADY You better ease off that stuff, James. It's pretty acidic. 
James takes a powdered donut that lies on his coat, studies it curiously. 
JAMES LEER I can't help myself. I don't know what's the matter with me. 
GRADY Shit, James, you're hungover. What do you think's the matter with you? 
As GRADY turns away, James ponders this, then considers the ring of white sugar imprinted on his coat and re-sets the donut in precisely the same place. 
53	INT. GREENHOUSE - MOMENT LATER 
Through the steamy panes, we SEE GRADY approach with the balloon, enter. He crosses to a high table, sets the balloon down, and steps back, considering the placement. 
SARA O.S.) Feeling guilty? 
GRADY jumps--startled--and turns. Sara has materialized behind a ficus, large POTTING GLOVES on her hands. 
SARA (cont'd) I can't believe you hung up on me, you dick. 
GRADY Totally.  I'm sorry. A lot was happening this morning. Can you talk? 
Sara nods, moves the ficus to another table. 
SARA Walter's on campus, being the good soldier for WordFest. But he's a basket case. Someone stole Marilyn's jacket last night. And Poe's missing, too. 
GRADY I-heard. 
SARA You heard? How? 
GRADY A twelve-year-old policeman came by the house this morning. 
SARA Did you confess? 
GRADY looks up, mildly alarmed. 
SARA Your fingerprints were all over the bedroom. 
GRADY Really? That was fast. 
SARA (frowning) I'm kidding. Hello? 
GRADY Oh. Right. Ha. Listen, about last night. There is something I need to tell... 
SARA Are you limping? Why are you limping? 
GRADY Hub? Oh, well, that's part of what I need to . 
SARA Did you pass out again, Grady? Did you fall somewhere? 
GRADY No. I mean. Well, actually, yes. Sort of. I don't remember. Listen, Sara, I have to tell you something. 
SARA All right. 
Sara settles back, folds her arms. Waiting. 
GRADY I... 
As GRADY stares into Sara's eyes, things begin to blur. 
GRADY (cont'd) ...want to be with you. 
Sara looks at him. 
SARA Gee, Grady, that sounded so heartfelt.  I don't know whether to swoon or smirk. 
GRADY Carvel? Where's Carvel? 
JAMES LEER Outside Scranton. 
GRADY I never heard of it. 
JAMES LEER It's a hellhole. Three motels and a mannequin factory. My dad worked there for thirty-five years. 
GRADY Your father worked in a mannequin factory? 
JAMES LEER Seitz Plastics. That's where he met my morn. She was a fry cook in the cafeteria. Before that, she'd been a dancer. 
GRADY What kind of dancer? . 
JAMES LEER Whatever kind they wanted her to be. 
GRADY (in disbelief) James Leer, are you telling me your mother was a stripper? 
JAMES LEER I'm telling you what I was told by my uncle. And he should know. He ran half a dozen men's clubs in Baltimore before he skipped town on a bad debt. 
GRADY Didn't you say your Mom went to Catholic school? 
JAMES LEER When we fall, we fall hard. 
GRADY Amazing. 
GRADY takes the joint from the ashtray, lights it, then notices-with surprise--James has his hand out. 
GRADY (cont'd) I thought you were the guy who didn't like to lose control of his emotions. 
JAMES LEER Maybe I just needed the moment to present itself. 
55	EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD (KINSHIP) - DAY .(ONE HOUR LATER) 
GRADY glides down the graceful, tree-lined streets of a modest, but well-kept neighborhood. James still has the JOINT-now only a tiny nub-pinched between his fingers. 
JAMES LEER This is so nice. It's like where Andy Hardy would live. What's it called again? 
GRADY Kinship. 
JAMES LEER Kinship. And what's here? 
GRADY Unless I miss my bet...my wife. 
James' heavy eyelids flutter with surprise. 
JAMES LEER The one that left you? 
GRADY That's right. That one. 
56	EXT. FRONT PORCH - WINTERS FAMILY HOUSE 
GRADY RAPS on the front door, then cups his hands against the glass of the living room window, squints inside. Nothing. As he turns away, GRADY sees James sitting on the hood of the Galaxie with the box of powdered donuts. He's sitting in the indentation. 
JAMES LEER Someone jumped on your car with their butt ..- 
GRADY How can you tell? 
JAMES LEER You can see the outline of a butt. 
As GRADY nods, James holds out the donut box. 
JAMES LEER (cont'd) Want one. They're incredible. Incredible. 
GRADY Smoke the rest of that joint, James, and you can start on the box. 
58	EXT. BACK PORCH - BACK YARD (MOMENTS LATER) 
As GRADY steps onto the back porch, James follows. 
JAMES LEER Maybe she didn't come here. 
GRADY She came here. We'll just wait. In the meantime, I need you to shimmy through. 
James stares at the "Doggy Door" cut into the back porch door. 
GRADY Relax. Emily hasn't carried a house key since she was twelve years old. And your hips are as slim as hers. 
JAMES LEER It's not that. It just reminded me of-- you know-of what's in the car. In the trunk. 
GRADY (a pang of guilt himself) Oh. Right. Well, let's try not to think about that. 
James takes another sad glance at the little door, then drops onto ail fours. 
59	INT. LIVING ROOM - WINTERS HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER 
GRADY leads James through the house. Everything about it speaks of family. Even the furniture seems arranged so that people will gather together, light a fire, talk. 
JAMES LEER It feels really... good. ..here. 
GRADY I know. It's the house you want to wake up in on Christmas morning. (moving off) Make yourself at home. I'll be right back. 
GRADY Mom. Dad. 
70	INT. DEN - WINTERS HOUSE - (A BIT LATER) 
Hank Winters emerges from the bathroom with a roll of tape, a bottle of alcohol, and some cotton wool. 
HANK Well, it's infected, I can tell you that. I'm just going to clean it up a bit. It's up to you to-find someone who knows what they're doing. Here. Put your foot up. 
GRADY puts his foot up on Hank's lazy-Boy, then notices a BOOK lying face down on the seat. The AUTHOR on the back cover looks as if he's trying very hard to look consequential. To his surprise, GRADY realizes the author is himself. 
HANK So he's one of your students, this boy? 
GRADY glances into the living room, where James and Irene sit on a long couch together, sipping something hot. James is looking out the window, a curious expression on his face. GRADY looks out his own window, sees the Newfoundland sniffing curiously at-the Galaxie's trunk. When he glances back into the living room, he and James make brief eye contact, then blink, look away. 
GRADY Yes. He's a good kid. Maybe a little messed up. 
HANK Well, I'm sure with the proper guidance he'll be fine. 
GRADY tries to read Hank's face---is he messing with him?--but Hank gives nothing away. GRADY nods to the book. 
GRADY What made you pull out that old thing? 
HANK (shrugging) I was thinking of you. 
GRADY And? 
HANK It's no Arsonist's Daughter, but I guess you know that. It's a young man's book. It got me remembering how it felt to be young. 
GRADY Maybe I should read it. 
HANK Oh, I don't think there's any danger of you aging prematurely, Grady. 
GRADY doesn't have to read Hank's face this time. 
GRADY Where's Emily, Hank? 
HANK I 'don't know if she'd want me  to tell you that, Grady. 
GRADY I'm not going to stalk her. Hank. I just. ..want to know where I stand. 
Hank looks up, incredulous. 
HANK Where you stand? 
GRADY (embarrassed) l-just want to say I'm sorry. 
HANK She's in Philadelphia seeing Linda Aahby. The neurologist. 
GRADY Neurologist? Why? What's wrong? 
HANK (frowning) Nothing's wrong. They went to Wellesley together. 
GRADY (sheepishly) Oh. Right. Linda ...I haven't been doing a lot of sleeping lately. My editor's in town and I have the book to finish and-- 
HANK Ah, right. The book. 
GRADY starts to continue, then stops, cowed by something in Hank's tone, something dismissive. Instead, he looks away, toward the living room, and catches sight of James again, sitting alone now with his big cup of cocoa. 
GRADY Listen, Hank, I'm sorry about ail this. I didn't come here to upset you and Irene. I want you to know that. 
HANK Why did you come here, Grady? 
GRADY gestures vaguely. 
GRADY I -just wanted to see her, I guess-- Emily. And to see you too-you and Irene. And to let everyone know that, even though it may be difficult to comprehend now, this-everything that's happening-it's not forever. It doesn't mean "Goodbye." 
HANK Give me a break, Grady. 
Hank snaps off the tape, slaps Grady's ankle. 
HANK You're done. 
71	INT. GALAXIE - MOVING - DUSK   71 
GRADY glowers darkly at the road, then puts his hand up against the HEATING VENT which, apparently, is not putting out any heat. 
JAMES LEER I'm having a really good time, Professor Tripp. 
GRADY glances over, sees James burrowing into the Ziploc. 
GRADY I'm really happy for you, James. But do me a favor, will you? Lay off my dope. That stuff's not for amateurs. 
James looks at Ziploc as GRADY fiddles with the heat LEVER. 
JAMES LEER I just wanted a little sip. 
GRADY (squinting at him) I just wanted a little sip? Tell me, James, exactly what point was it that you turned into Serpent Boy? 
JAMES LEER Probably about the time you gave me the codeine pills last night. 
GRADY stops with the heater, glances over at James, whose face bears not the slightest trace of irony. 
Grady's HOUSE looks like a three-dollar whore on a block full of nuns. MUSIC BLARES, LIGHT BLAZES from every window, and there are so many CARS GRADY is forced to leave the Galaxie in the middle of the street. 
GRADY (knowingly) Crabtree. 
81	INT. GRADY'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER 
Times Square before the ball drops. GRADY enters, scans the room, then shoulders his way to the stairs. 
82	INT. GRADY'S OFFICE 
Hannah Green sits on the sofa, twisting a long strand of hair around her finger as she reads a THICK MANUSCRIPT. 
GRADY (entering) Hey. 
HANNAH GREEN Grady! 
She slaps the page she is reading back onto the stack at her thigh. GRADY stares. The manuscript. It's his. 
HANNAH GREEN (embarrassed) I know I shouldn't have, but there it was, just sort of lying out, and I couldn't resist and-and--I suck. 
GRADY No, it's okay. I just can't believe I left it out in the open like that. CRABTREE hasn't been in here, has he? Poking around? 
HANNAH GREEN I don't know--maybe- I don't think so. 
Grady's  mind races with unfortunate possibilities, but only briefly: his immediate thoughts are elsewhere. 
GRADY Listen, Hannah. You don't remember where that aunt worked, do you? James' aunt. 
HANNAH GREEN He shot the Chancellor's dog, didn't he? The blind one. 
GRADY Actually, He's not the Chancellor' s--What? 
HANNAH GREEN At first the police thought he just ran away, but this afternoon Dr. Gaskell found some blood spots on the carpet - 
GRADY Jesus. 
HANNAH GREEN CRABTREE said it sounded like something James would be messed up in. 
GRADY Crabtree? He doesn't even know James. 
HANNAH GREEN Who does? 
Just then, Crabtree's VOICE bellows in the hallway outside. 
CRABTREE (O.S.) Trip?! Where are you' 
GRADY looks anxiously toward the door. 
GRADY The aunt, Hannah. Where did you take James that day? 
HANNAH GREEN I told you, Sewickly Heights. 
GRADY But where? I need the street. 
HANNAH GREEN I don't know, Grady. I just dropped him on a corner. 
CRABTREE (O.S.) Trip?! 
GRADY Shit. 
As GRADY starts to turn away, Hannah hooks her finger inside his belt buckle. 
HANNAH GREEN No! Don't go. I've been waiting ail night for you. 
GRADY looks at Hannah's hand, where it rests. He looks terrified. 
GRADY Listen, Hannah, I'm flattered, really, but right now I-- 
CRABTREE (bursting in) Tripp, where the hell. . . 
CRABTREE stops, takes in the tableau before him. 
CRABTREE (cont'd) Oh, I'm sorry. Am I interrupting a. student- teacher conference? 
GRADY delicately removes Hannah's hand from his buckle, points at Crabtree. 
GRADY You stay there. 
CRABTREE What? Ohhhh. Is that... it? 
CRABTREE cocks his head toward the reams of paper stacked on Grady's desk. 
CRABTREE Honestly, Tripp. Do you actually think I would sneak in here and read your book without asking you? 
GRADY Gee, I don't know. Crabs. I don't seem to remember you actually asking me if you could invite 200 people over to trash my living room. 
CRABTREE Sometimes we have to improvise. 
GRADY (ignoring him) Think, Hannah. Does James have any friends. I mean, besides you and. ..me? 
CRABTREE James? My James? What's happened? 
86	EXT. BASEMENT DOOR 
The DOOR swings open to reveal James Leer, decked out in a pair of RED, INK-STAINED PAJAMAS sagging badly in the seat. He looks like one of Santa's elves. 
JAMES LEER Hey. What are you guys doing here? 
CRABTREE We're springing you. Leer. Get some pants on. 
As they step inside, GRADY gives James' PJs the once- over. 
GRADY I can't believe you made fun of my robe. 
87	INT. JAMES' ROOM - BASEMENT    87 
Electric CANDELABRAS light a large converted cellar whose walls are crowded with MOVIE POSTERS and LOBBY CARDS. There are STACKS of what look suspiciously like LIBRARY BOOKS and an enormous BAROQUE BED, complete with CANOPY. 
CRABTREE I like what you've done with it. When's Captain Nemo moving in? 
JAMES LEER The candelabras were my Gran's. 
GRADY Oh, Christ, don't start on ol' Gran or we'll leave you here. 
CRABTREE Hey, I heard all about it--the parents, the grandparents, the China town thing-- and I believe you, okay? That's why we're here. Now go get dressed. 
James scoops up the shirt GRADY lent him. this morning. 
JAMES LEER Can I--I mean--do you mind--if I wear this again. Professor Tripp? 
GRADY Ah, wear whatever you want. 
James flinches, stung, then disappears into a bathroom. 
CRABTREE So modest. 
GRADY So sensitive. 
CRABTREE (nosing around the room) Oh, come on, Tripp. Cut the kid some slack. 
GRADY It's just ail that crap he spins out. Just once I'd like to know if the little bastard is telling the truth. 
CRABTREE The-truth. I know that's always been real important to you. Key, check this out... 
CRABTREE leans over an old ROYAL TYPEWRITER, reads from the freshly-typed PAGE curling from the carriage. 
CRABTREE Finally, the door opened. It-was a shock to: see him, shuffling into the room like an aging prizefighter. Limping. Beaten.' (with an amused smile) Sound like anyone we know? (resuming) But it was later, when the great man squinted into the bitter glow or twilight... (frowning) Bitter glow of twilight? This kid definitely needs an editor. (resuming) ...and muttered simply, "It means nothing. All of it. Nothing," that the true shock came. It was then that the boy understood that his hero's true injuries lay hidden in a darker place. His heart...' 
CRABTREE stops abruptly. 
GRADY Yes? 'His heart...' 
CRABTREE hesitates, then... reads on: 
CRABTREE 'His heart, once capable of inspiring others so completely, could no longer inspire so much as itself. It beat now only out of habit. It beat now only because it could. ' 
GRADY nods, his face unreadable, then James returns. 
JAMES LEER I'm ready... 
James stops, sees the two men looking at him. 
JAMES LEER You all right, Professor Tripp? 
CRABTREE He's great. Come on, let's blow before ol' Gran decides to boil your bones for breakfast. 
JAMES LEER Oh, well, that's just it. She's been coming down here, every half hour or so, to, sort of, check on me. If I'm not here, she might ...call the police or.. .something. 
CRABTREE Hhhuh. So we decoy her. Stick a couple pillows and one of your teddy bears under the spread and she won't know the difference. 
JAMES LEER (brightening) Yeah. Like in Against All Flags. Only they use a couple big hams. 
GRADY No. 
CRABTREE and James turn. 
GRADY I've got something better than a teddy bear. 
CUT TO: POE -- as he's lowered delicately onto James' bed. 
88	INT. JAMES' ROOM - BASEMENT (A FEW MINUTES LATER) 
GRADY strategically arranges the coverlet, gently adjusting Poe's head so only a TUFT of FUR shows. He steps back, joining CRABTREE and James for an assessment. 
GRADY Sweet dreams, Jimmy. 
89	EXT. GRADY'S HOUSE - LATER 
The lights are still blazing, the front door is wide open, but not a soul remains. 
90	INT. LIVING ROOM 
A quiet disaster, the only sound an LP playing meekly on the STEREO. James passes through first, ignoring the TORTILLA CHIPS POPPING under his shoes, then CRABTREE and GRADY appear. 
GRADY Sara. I'm in love with her. 
Silence. Then Walter's VOICE returns: even, administrative. 
WALTER'S VOICE Are you drinking. Professor Tripp? Right now. 
GRADY sips on his roach, responds in a pinched voice. 
GRADY No. 
WALTER'S VOICE Nevertheless, I'd like to see you in my office Monday morning. 
As the line goes dead, GRADY stares at the phone, wondering if he has, in fact, just done what he thinks he's just done. 
95	EXT. GRADY'S NEIGHBORHOOD - SUNDAY MORNING (NEXT DAY) 
A CAR rattles down the street, NEWSPAPERS pinwheeling from-the window. 
96	INT. GRADY'S OFFICE - SAME TIME 
A heavy THHNK hits the driveway outside and GRADY blinks. Sitting in his pink robe, bleary-eyed, he reconsiders the piece of paper curling from his typewriter. 
GRADY'S POV - of THE PAGE 
It's obvious he's been sitting like this for some time. Just then, the DISTINCTIVE PURR of an ENGINE is HEARD. GRADY peers through the window, watches a CAB. glide to the curb below. A Citroen DS23. Sara. 
97	EXT. FRONT PORCH - GRADY'S HOUSE 
GRADY steps onto the porch, unintentionally punting a BOTTLE of Iron City Beer onto the front lawn.. 
GRADY Sara. 
SARA I tried to call, but apparently there's something wrong... 
Sara leans down, replaces the uncradled phone. 
SARA (cont'd) ...with your phone. Unfortunately, mine was ringing loud and clear this morning. 
GRADY doesn't know what this means, but he's pretty sure it's not good. 
GRADY Oh? 
SARA It seems one of our students is - missing and his parents found a dead dog in his bed. 
GRADY (slumping to the porch) I'm sorry, Sara. I've been trying to tell you. It's all my- 
Sara raises her hand, silencing him. 
SARA I'm not very happy with you right now, Grady. But more importantly, Walter's not very happy and he's gotten the police involved. They seem to think James Leer is somehow responsible for all of this. You wouldn't happen to know where James is, would you, Grady? 
GRADY Inside. 
SARA And the jacket? 
GRADY Over there. In the backseat of the... 
Grady's hand hangs in mid-air, gesturing pointlessly to the driveway, where the only thing that exists is an oil stain roughly the shape of North Dakota. 
GRADY (cont'd) Someone stole my car. 
SARA Grady. 
GRADY Honestly. Someone stole my car. I parked it right there last night. 
SARA Are you sure you parked it there? 
GRADY Of course, I'm sure.  Ah, Christ, the puberty police are back. 
Sara turns, sees Officer Pupcik cruising to the curb. 
SARA I'll deal with this. You dig up James. 
98	INT. CRABTREE'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
CRABTREE sits in bed, flipping through the pages of The Love Parade while stroking a tiny TUFT of HAIR that is the . sole visible part of .James Leer. 
GRADY (swinging in) Is he awake? 
CRABTREE I'm afraid he's pretty worn out, poor kid. 
GRADY Nevertheless. There's a police officer standing on the porch and I don't think he's going away. 
JAMES LEER (from under the covers) That same guy? 
CRABTREE peels back the blankets and James Leer opens one eye. 
JAMES LEER You snore. 
CRABTREE So I hear. 
JAMES LEER (studying Grady) No offense, Professor Tripp, but you look sorta crappy. 
GRADY I think I might have. 
SARA And what do you think you might have said? 
GRADY I think I might've said I was in love with you. 
Sara's face remains .unchanged. 
GRADY (cont'd) He told you. 
SARA He told me. 
GRADY And what did you say? 
SARA I said it didn't sound like you. 
Sara tosses her cigarette in .the gutter, gets into her car, and dives away.  GRADY looks after her sadly, then turns, sees CRABTREE standing on the porch wearing a shirt which claims "Ativan Chases the Clouds Away." 
CRABTREE So- what do we do now? , 
GRADY Find the jacket. 
CRABTREE Oh' huh. Exactly how do we do that? 
GRADY First I see if Hannah will let me borrow her car. 
CRABTREE It seems to me that girl would let you borrow her pancreas. 
100	INT. HANNAH'S ROOM   - 100 
Hannah, wrapped loosely in cotton sheets, SMILES as she listens to the Goatee Kid, who sits cross-legged at the foot of-her bed, fully clothed. 
GOATEE KID I'm telling you, the tango is ail about latent homosexual love. Look at the way they dance-- it's sodomy. 
HANNAH GREEN (laughing) Stop it. 
Hannah looks up, sees GRADY in the doorway and blushes. She pulls the sheet up, gives an oddly formal wave. 
HANNAH GREEN Grady. Hi. What's up? 
Jeff eases off the bed, past GRADY uneasily. 
GOATEE KID I'll be ...somewhere else. 
GRADY Hey, Jeff. If you're really interested in discussing that business with the tango, try the guy at the end of the hall. 
Jeff nods--puzzled--then goes. GRADY smirks. 
GRADY He cribbed that from Borges. 
HANNAH GREEN It beats 'What's your major?' 
GRADY nods, detecting a new aloofness in her voice. 
GRADY Right. Anyway, I was wondering if I could borrow your car. Mine's sort of out of commission. 
HANNAH GREEN Sure. The keys are on the dresser next to. ..to your book. 
The hitch in Hannah's voice hangs in the room like a cloud. 
HANNAH GREEN I uh, I didn't finish, I ...fell asleep. 
GRADY That good, hub? 
HANNAH GREEN No, it's not that, it's... 
Hannah glances at the huge stack of paper sitting on her dresser, then, hesitantly, looks back to Grady. 
HANNAH GREEN It's just that, you know, I was thinking about how, in class, you're always telling us '-that writers make choices--at least the good ones. And, don't get me wrong. I'm not saying the book isn't really great-I mean, really great- but at times it's, well, very detailed, you know, with the genealogies of everyone's horses and ail the dental records and so on-and I don't know, maybe I'm wrong, but it sort of reads, in places, like, well, actually, like... (with trepidation) ...you didn't make any choices at all. And I was wondering if it might not be different if, maybe, when you wrote, you weren't always ...under the influence. 
GRADY (stung) Hh huh. Well, thanks for the thought, but, as shocking as this may sound, I'm not the first writer to sip a little weed. And furthermore, it might interest you to know that one book I wrote, as you say, 'under the influence, ' happened to win a little something called the PEN award which, by the way, I accepted 'under the influence. ' 
Hannah nods, averts her eyes, and immediately GRADY feels ridiculous. He starts to say something, but instead gathers his manuscript and exits. 
101	INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Crabtree, dressed now, studies the freight 'in Grady's arms as he reaches the bottom of the stairs. 
CRABTREE Want some help with that? 
GRADY (passing by) Don't touch it. 
102	INT. HANNAH'S RENAULT - MOVING 
CRABTREE sucks on a Kool, driving Hannah's rattling Renault too fast, shifting gears apparently at random. GRADY rides shotgun, still wearing the robe over his clothes, the Wonder Boys manuscript sitting like a watermelon on his lap-looking, all in all, fairly pathetic. 
CRABTREE Let me get this straight. Jerry Nathan owes you money. So, as collateral, he gives you his car. 
GRADY Only now I'm starting to think the car wasn't exactly Jerry's to give. 
CRABTREE So whose car is it? 
VERNON Shut up. (to Oola) Cupcake. Please. Inside. 
OOLA You' re not going to shoot him, are you? 
VERNON I'm going to shoot him. If he doesn't put that gun down. 
GRADY It's just a souvenir. They don't even make the caps anymore. 
VERNON Bullshit. I know a gun when I see one. And that's a gun. 
GRADY No, really.... 
GRADY lifts his arm, points the little pearl-handled pistol to the DARK CLOUDS overhead. 
107	INT. HANNAH'S RENAULT 
CRABTREE jumps as the tiny pistol at the end of Grady's arm FLASHES, makes a FEEBLE POP in the wind. 
CRABTREE Holy shit. 
108	EXT. KRAVNIKS 
Vernon stands half-hunched, stunned. 
VERNON Are you crazy! 
The gunshot seems to have cleared Grady's head. He stares at the gun, watches Vernon wrest it from his hand. 
VERNON (cont'd) Get out! What's the matter with you? Can't you see the condition my girl's in? 
As GRADY gets out of the car, Vernon places his hand on Oola's tummy. 
VERNON You all right, cupcake? 
OOLA Who's Vernon? 
A rude SQUEAL breaks the silence--rubber scratching asphalt--and Grady, Oola, and Vernon turn to see Hannah Green's rattling Renault lurching awkwardly toward them. 
VERNON What the...? 
Gears GRINDING, tires smoking, CRABTREE fish-tails wildly, then kicks open the passenger door. 
CRABTREE Tripp! Run! 
GRADY doesn't move an inch, watching in mute amazement as CRABTREE whistles by, proceeds halfway down the block, then turns back for another pass. 
VERNON Who the hell is that? 
GRADY A Manhattan book editor murdering a Mormon girl's clutch. 
The car bucks crazily, picks up speed, and Crabtree-- swiping aside a flutter of MANUSCRIPT PAGES that have taken flight inside the car--begins to veer right toward Grady, Vernon, and Oola. 
VERNON Woah. 
Vernon steps into the street, levels the German Nine. 
VERNON (cont'd) Pull off, you crazy motherfucker! 
Frantic, GRADY steps between Vernon, the German Nine, and the oncoming Crabtree. 
GRADY No! Don't shoot! He's just a lousy driver. 
CRABTREE fans the wheel wildly, goes into a slide and the passenger door snaps wide, releasing what looks to be a FLOCK OF WHITE DOVES into the wind-whipped sky. 
Only, these ain't birds.   - ^ 
GRADY Oh... my... God! 
These are PAGES. Seven years of-pages. 
CRABTREE goes into another slide, one-hops the curb, and smashes flat into the weathered GLOVE of BILL MAZEROSKI painted on the front wail of KRAVNIK'S SPORTING GOODS. 
As Hannah Green's RADIATOR EXPLODES, CRABTREE steps free of the car and looks skyward. It's a ticker-tape parade ail the way down the street, ending in the frigid waters of the Ohio River. 
GRADY (cont'd) (to Vernon) I take it back.  Shoot him. 
109	INT. GALAXIE - MOVING 
Vernon drives, Oola at his side. In-the back, CRABTREE puffs philosophically on a Kool while GRADY sits grimly with the sad remains of his manuscript: SEVEN RUMPLED PAGES, one of which bears the watermark of a shoe print. 
CRABTREE Naturally you have copies. 
GRADY I have an alternate version of the first chapter. 
CRABTREE You'll be all right then.  Look at Carlyle, when he lost his luggage. 
GRADY That was MacCaulay. 
CRABTREE Or Hemingway, when Hadley lost all those stories. 
GRADY He was never able to reproduce them. 
GRADY Came to my senses. CRABTREE 
Ah. Well. Congratulations. Meanwhile, what is James supposed to do? Pray for Walter Gaskell to come to his? 
GRADY Walter Gaskell isn't going to send James Leer to jail, Crabs. I know that. 
CRABTREE Do you know he won't expel him? 
GRADY No. But I don't think that matters. 
CRABTREE That's very enlightened, Professor. It's comforting to know that America's children have you for a teacher. 
GRADY blinks, ponders this briefly, then looks toward the buildings of the campus, his VOICE still distant. 
GRADY Nobody teaches a writer anything. You tell them what you know. You tell them to find their voice and stick with it, because that's all you have in the end. You tell the ones who have it to keep at it and you tell the ones who don't to keep at it, too. Because that's the only way to get where you're going. (ruefully) Of course, it helps if you know where you want to go. (thoughtfully) Maybe that's the only thing--that and Sara-- that's made the last seven years worthwhile. 
GRADY slides James' knapsack off his shoulder, smiles cryptically as he considers it. - 
GRADY (cont'd) As for James, he doesn't need me anymore... 
Without warning, GRADY tosses CRABTREE the knapsack. 
GRADY (cont'd) He's got you. 
CRABTREE stares at the saggy green canvas in his hands, watches GRADY walk away. 
CRABTREE Me? What can I do? 
GRADY Gee, I don't know, Crabs... (over his shoulder) Improvise. You're good at that. 
GRADY continues on, leaving CRABTREE to stand alone, as he walks toward the buildings in the distance. 
CRABTREE I'm sorry, Tripp. 
GRADY stops, turns. 
GRADY You peeked, didn't you? 
CRABTREE I peeked. 
GRADY considers this. Nods. It-doesn't seem to matter anymore 
CRABTREE It really had the makings, Tripp. There was a lot to admire. I've ...never read anything quite like it. 
If there was a Kentucky Derby for editorial bullshit, Crabtree's last three utterances would finish win, place, and show. And GRADY knows it. 
GRADY You're not just trying to make me feel better? 
CRABTREE looks directly at Grady, his old friend. 
CRABTREE Scout's honor. 
CRABTREE and GRADY stare into each other's eyes. Both are acutely aware of the subtext of this conversation. 
GRADY Well, thanks for that, Crabs. 
111	INT. HALLWAY - ENGLISH DEPARTMENT 
Dead quiet. Gradually, STEPS are heard, coming from the stairwell, then GRADY limps into view. 
112	INT. GRADY'S CLASSROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
GRADY surveys the room. Empty chairs. Empty desks. 
He walks to a WINDOW, the same window he stood at two afternoons ago when reading James Leer's story. A chill breeze pitches the fabric of his shirt as he studies the barren benches and icy walkways of the quad. Finally, he-. turns away, settles behind his desk and, reaching into his pocket, removes the seven remaining pages of his manuscript. He considers them, then folds them in half length-wise. He continues, folding the top right corner down into a triangle along the first crease... 
113	EXT. QUAD 
A moment. Then-from the third floor window-a PAPER AIRPLANE glides into view, soaring then dropping, soaring then dropping, again and again, graceful as a dove. 
114	INT. LOBBY - THAW HALL - LATER 
GRADY hobbles into the lobby just as one of the auditorium doors swings open. APPLAUSE SWELLS and he spies Sara standing inside, talking to a STUDENT USHER. 
GRADY Sara! 
Sara turns ...as the door glides shut. As GRADY hustles forward, Q, wine glass in hand, intercepts him. 
Q Grady. I have to tell you. I took another look at Arsonist's Daughter the other night. There's a description of a bald cypress that left' me breathless. 
GRADY (pushing past him) Thanks, Q. I felt the same way about the bank teller's breasts in your last one. 
115	INT. BACK ROW - AUDITORIUM - THAW HALL 
GRADY enters, but Sara is ...gone. He picks his way behind the back row, scanning the aisles. 
GIRL'S VOICS Hey, Professor Tripp. 
It's Carrie McWhirty, James' tormentor from workshop. GRADY takes another look around, then drops into the seat- next to her. 
CARRIE MCWHIRTY If you're looking for Hannah, she's on the aisle. 
...there is a SHARP JERK on his- COLLAR, a SHIRT BUTTON caroms off his cheek, and slowly, he is hauled back. 
SARA Grady, what are you doing, you idiot? 
GRADY looks up into Sara's freckled face. 
GRADY Looking for you. 
He wants to say more, he opens his mouth, but then... ALL GOES BLACK AS SARA'S VOICE CALLS... 
faintly at first, then more forcefully, calling Grady's name, calling so insistently that the earth seems to RUSH upward until we see that she is... 
KISSING him or something, and all goes softly... Blue. 
121	INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY 
GRADY lies in a powder blue paper gown surrounded by blue plastic curtains in a blue room. Through a gap in the curtains, he can see the bottle of-GLUCOSE that drips slowly into his arm, and beyond, a window. Flakes of SNOW fall outside. 
The DOOR SQUEALS, a SHADOW ripples across the blue, then the curtains part and a RESIDENT with a clipboard appears. His NAMETAG says GREENHUT. 
GRADY I passed out. 
GREENHUT You did. 
GRADY I've been doing that a lot lately. 
GREENHUT So I hear. You've also been smoking a lot of marijuana, I understand. 
GRADY Do you think that's why I've been having these... (grabbing James' term) ... spells? 
GREENHUT How long have you been having them? 
GRADY The last month maybe. 
GREENHUT How long have you been smoking marijuana? 
GRADY Spiro T. Agnew was vice president, I believe. 
GREENHUT That's probably not the problem, then. What about your lifestyle. Any major changes recently? 
GRADY I've been trying to finish a book... 
GREENHUT And your wife left you. 
GRADY Is that in my chart? 
GREENHUT I spoke with the woman who saved your life. You're lucky she came along when she did. 
GRADY considers the larger ramifications of this statement 
GRADY I know. 
GREENHUT (tapping the glucose bottle) You need to see a doctor, Mr. Tripp. An internist. And I think you really ought to consider seeing a therapist, as well. 
GRADY She told you about. . . 
GREENHUT Her dog, yes. 
GRADY Actually, it was her husband's dog... 
Greenhut glances up, looking GRADY in the eyes for the first time, and GRADY stops. 
GREENHUT Look, Mr. Tripp. You have a drug problem, all right? On top of that, you have a bite on your ankle that is severely infected. We pumped you with antibiotics so you'll be fine, but another day or two and you might have lost the foot. As for your spells. I'm guessing they're a result of the anxiety you've been experiencing lately. 
GRADY They're anxiety attacks? That's a little disappointing. 
GREENHUT Better luck next time. 
GRADY So is my friend...is Sara still here? 
GREENHUT No. There's no one here. 
GRADY I have to see her. As soon as possible. 
Greenhut studies Grady, calibrating the desperation in his eyes, then takes a quick glance at his watch. 
GREENHUT Look, Mr. Tripp. If you really want to leave, I can't stop you. But I'm going to write you a prescription for a course of ampicillin and I want you to follow it to the end-no matter how stupid you decide to be with everything else. All right? 
122	INT. HOSPITAL/BRIDGE WALKWAY - AFTERNOON 
GRADY sits in a WHEELCHAIR, watching the snow fail around him as a NURSE escorts him through the tunnel of glass that connects one building to another. 
GRADY I wonder if you could show me something. 
123	EXT. NURSERY - HOSPITAL - MOMENTS LATER 
GRADY stares through the glass. There are only TWO BABIES on display, heads dented from natural delivery, skin purple and crazy with veins. 
GRADY Are these the only ones you have? 
The nurse's eyes crinkle.

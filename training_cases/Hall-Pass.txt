FADE IN: 
EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT 
Very late. All is quiet. Then a battered MINI-VAN blows by a row of hedges that have been pruned to read: 'WELCOME TO CAPE COD.' A moment later a FLASHING COP CAR flies by in HOT 
PURSUIT. 
INT. MINI-VAN - SAME 
The WINDSHIELD IS GONE and the wind blows back the hair of two BEAT-UP-LOOKING MEN. The driver, FRED SEARING, 40-ish, has a look of determination and resolve on his chunky face, despite the BLACK EYE and BLOOD-STAINED TISSUE dangling out of his nose. The nervous passenger is RICK MILLS, 38. 
RICK Pull over, man! 
FRED No way, I can out-run 'em! 
RICK No you can't--not in this thing! Another POLICE CRUISER FISHTAILS OUT OF A SIDE STREET and 
JOINS THE CHASE. 
RICK (CONT'D) Oh God, now there's two of 'em! 
FRED I don't care--I'm not stopping 'til we get there! 
RICK Are you crazy?! 
FRED Yeah, I'm crazy! I'm crazy about my wife! 
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF A CAPE COD HOSPITAL - NIGHT Rick and Fred come SKIDDING UP to the EMERGENCY ENTRANCE followed by the two police cruisers. When they stop, we see that somebody has spray-painted 'HORNY OLD MAN' on the side of the mini-van. Fred jumps out and SPRINTS toward the entrance. SEVERAL COPS spring from their cars and give chase. Before Fred can reach the front doors, he gets KNOCKED VIOLENTLY to the ground. Rick climbs out of the passenger seat with HIS HANDS RAISED. 
RICK Hear me out, gentlemen, I can explain every--! AS A BURLY OFFICER'S HEAD CONNECTS WITH RICK'S CHEST, we... 
FREEZE FRAME 
.And FADE TO BLACK... and then: 
SMASH CUT TO: Law & Order MUSIC CUE as we SUPER: 
TWO WEEKS EARLIER 
FADE BACK IN: 
INT. RICK'S FAMILY ROOM - DAY 
ON TV SCREEN - a video shows several YOUNG PEOPLE, early- 20's, sunning themselves at the beach. A YOUNG-LOOKING RICK hams it up for the camera. 
RICK (O.S.) See the stud in the blue shorts? That's me the summer I got out of college. 
LITTLE GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.) Wow, Dad, you used to have muscles. REVERSE ANGLE reveals EMMA, 6, and GUNNAR, 4, sitting on either side of Rick. 
RICK I still have a few. 
GUNNAR Where? Rick shoots him a look. 
RICK They're hidden. BACK ON TV SCREEN - A PRETTY GIRL with a knockout body comes up and puts her arms around Rick. 
EMMA Who's that girl? 
RICK That's Mommy. 
EMMA No, I mean the young one standing next to you. 
RICK That's Mommy. 
EMMA Mommy used to have long hair? And she wore a bikini? 
RICK 
(WISTFULLY) Yes she did. 
EMMA How come she doesn't wear a bikini anymore? 
GUNNAR Is it because of her fat ass? 
RICK I guess. What? No. Who said Mommy's got a fat ass? 
GUNNAR Mommy. 
LONG BEAT. 
(GETTING IT) It was your air space. 
WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Hey, guys. They turn to see a BEAUTIFUL WOMAN with a healthy tan walking past carrying several drinks. This is MISSY FRANKENFIELD, mid-30's. 
RICK AND FRED Hey, Missy. 
MISSY (CALLING back to them) Don't forget to mingle! The guys watch Missy walk away. 
FRED Wow. Missy's looking pretty good for someone going through a divorce. 
RICK Yeah, that's rough stuff--I heard they might have to sell the house. 
FRED Too bad. You gonna hit 'em up for the listing? 
RICK What am I, a vulture? Nah, I don't go after the divorcee business unless they approach me first. 
FRED Yeah, it's kind of tacky, huh? As the guys crane their necks to get a better view of Missy's ass, we... REVERSE ANGLE to reveal Maggie, Grace and Dr. Lucy sipping lemondrops and watching Rick and Fred from across the room. 
GRACE Look at those two meatheads checking out Missy Frankenfield. What, do they think they're invisible over there? 
MAGGIE I thought you said Fred wasn't a gawker. 
GRACE He was standing right next to you. I can't let him know that I know-- that would take all the fun out of it. 
(CHUCKLES) You should see him. He's got some stupid move where he looks back before the girl passes to make it seem like he couldn't help but notice her ass. It's pathetic. Maggie and Dr. Lucy GIGGLE. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. RICK AND MAGGIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Rick's car is parked in the driveway, and he and Maggie are getting out. 
RICK How about I drive the babysitter home while you go upstairs and prepare the altar? He puts his arm around her as they walk toward the front door. 
MAGGIE I want to, honey, but I've got to get up early with the kids. 
RICK I'll get up with the kids. 
MAGGIE But I have to go out and buy a gift- -they're going to a birthday party tomorrow. 
RICK I'll cjet the gift, then I'll take the kids to the park, then to the party. You can dust stay in bed,, get your beauty sleep, and bask in the sweet, sweet pounding I'm about to give you. 
MAGGIE I love it when you sweet-talk me. Maggie smiles but as Rick opens the front door they FREEZE IN 
THEIR TRACKS. THEIR POV - the babysitter (PAIGE, 20, cute) is standing there with their 4-year-old, Gunnar. 
GUNNAR Mommy! Daddy! 
RICK 
(DEFLATED) Little buddy.. .what are you doing up? Gunnar runs into his mother's arms and Maggie shrugs apologetically to Rick. 
RICK (CONT'D) This is just a minor obstacle. 
CUT TO: 
INT. RICK'S MINI-VAN - NIGHT 
Rick is at the wheel of his Dodge Caravan and Paige sits in the passenger seat. She is on the busty side. 
RICK How were the kids tonight? 
PAIGE Perfect. That Gunnar is so cute-- all he wants to do is wrestle with me. Rick smiles at this. 
PAIGE (CONT'D) Mr. Mills, would it be okay to turn down the air--I'm a little chilly. Look--I got goose bumps. As she HOLDS OUT HER ARM to show him the GOOSE-BUMPS, we RACK FOCUS BEYOND HER ARM to the ERECT NIPPLES that are PIERCING THROUGH HER SHEER TOP like small tents. BACK ON Rick as his EYES GO WIDE WITH TERROR and he looks away. 
RICK Oh, uh, sure, I'm sorry. Flustered, he moves to the temperature control which in LARGE ILLUMINATED DIGITAL TYPE reads: 69!!! He quickly PUNCHES THE A/C OFF, then trains his eyes straight ahead and grips the steering wheel tight at ten-and-two. 
PAIGE Thank you. 
RICK 'Welcome. 
EXT. COLLEGE CAMPUS - NIGHT 
The mini-van pulls up in front of a sorority house. 
INT. RICK'S MINI-VAN - CONTINUOUS 
Paige hesitates before getting out. 
PAIGE Mr. Mills, can I ask you something? 
RICK Sure. 
PAIGE I was wondering... 
(SQUINTS NERVOUSLY) .could you buy me some beer? Rick looks surprised. 
ED That's because you were shooting laser beams at the java babe. 
RICK Well, no, we were just-- 
ED Come on, gentlemen, you're married men and she's half your age--grow 
P- The guys can't muster a response. 
ED (CONT'D) So I guess I'll be seeing you at the house-warming party this weekend. 
RICK Hm? 
ED This Saturday afternoon at the new casa--we're inally in and we're having a little celebration. 
RICK Oh, I don't know if we can-- 
ED Your wives already RSVP'd. 
RICK Right on. 
ED 'Til then. Ed HOLDS OUT HIS FIST to them. 
ED (CONT'D) Come on, pound the potato. Rick and Fred reluctantly take turns TAPPING Ed's fist with theirs. Then Ed leaves. 
FRED 
(UNDER BREATH) What a d-bag. 
RICK He's right though. Fred looks at Rick. 
RICK (CONT'D) What are we doing sitting here gawking at her for? We're married men--it's creepy. 
FRED I don't see what the big deal is-- we're not hurting anyone. What is he Big Brother--he's gonna tell me what I can look at now? For God sakes, don't take that away from me- -it's all I got! As Rick thinks about this, we... 
CUT TO: 
INT. RICK'S FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT 
CLOSE ON A BABY MONITOR - PULL BACK to reveal that it's in the middle of a POKER TABLE next to a pile of ONE-DOLLAR BILLS. Sitting around the table PLAYING LIAR'S POKER are Rick, Fred, GARY, HOG-HEAD, BAKER, and FLATS, all in their mid-30's to mid-40's. Hog-head has a huge melon, Baker is husky, Flats is a pale red-head, and Gary is slight and squirrelly. 
BAKER Rick, you open. Rick takes a fresh DOLLAR BILL off the pile in front of him and STUDIES THE SERIAL NUMBERS. 
RICK Four 9's. 
FRED Hey, where's Coakley? How come he didn't show? 
GARY Vegas. Hawaiian Tropic finals. The guys nod their approval. 
BAKER Man, imagine being Coakley? The guy's single, he's loaded, chicks love him, he doesn't have to answer to anybody. 
GARY That's the life. 
FRED That is the life. 
HOG-HEAD Let me ask you something: What would you guys pay to have your way with a Hawaiian Tropic girl for an entire weekend? The guys perk up as they think about this. 
HOG-HEAD (CONT'D) You get to pick any one you want-- and you know up front that you won't get her pregnant, no diseases, you're never gonna hear from her again, and your wife will never find out. 
GARY How's it possible to know that my wife won't find out? 
HOG-HEAD 
(ANNOYED) It's not. I'm saying if it were possible, like if I was a magic genie and I could grant you this wish but then make it like it never even happened. 
FLATS But would I still have memory of it? 
HOG-HEAD Oh yeah. Great memories. 
GARY Oof. I think I'd pay 500 bucks for that. Baker shoots him a look. 
BAKER You cheap,bastard. We're talking about an investment that gets your rocks off and protects your wife's feelings. I'd pay five grand. 
RICK Wow. 
GARY Well, excuse me, Mr. Wall Street, but us public school teachers aren't getting any of that bail-out money you're over-tipping everyone with. Just then, the front door OPENS and Maggie ENTERS. 
MAGGIE Hey, guys. 
RICK Oh, hey, honey. How was the book club? 
MAGGIE Great. 
FRED What did you guys read this month? 
MAGGIE Hemingway. 
GARY Old Man and the Sea? 
(RECOVERING) Come on, be reasonable, it was just guy-talk--it's not like it could really happen. Maggie shakes her head, disgusted, and leaves the room. 
RICK (CONT'D) 
(CALLING OUT) Love you! 
CUT TO: 
INT. RESTAURANT - DAY 
Maggie, Grace, and Dr. Lucy eat at an upscale restaurant. Dr. Lucy listens quietly to the women. 
GRACE Fred said five grand? What a blowhard! 
MAGGIE You know what's even funnier? Hog- head McCormick said he'd pay seven grand. 
GRACE What?! That bum hasn't worked since the dot-com bust--his wife supports him! The girls LAUGH. 
GRACE (CONT'D) Well, look on the bright side: At least they're not cheating on us. 
MAGGIE Sometimes I wonder if it would be better if they did cheat and get it over with. 
DR. LUCY You mean, rather than take the slow boat to resentment? The girls look to Dr. Lucy. 
DR. LUCY (CONT'D I'm just saying.. .maybe a little freedom would be good for them. And for you. 
(BEAT) Have you ever considered giving them a hall pass? 
GRACE A what? 
DR. LUCY A hall pass. A week off from marriage. Grace and Maggie stop chewing. 
MAGGIE Wait a minute. . .Are you saying let them go out and cheat? 
DR. LUCY I'm saying give them a week off from marriage. 
(BEAT) Look, most married men have foggy memories of their single days and they somehow get under the impression that if not for you, they'd be able to be with ail those women who entice them. 
GRACE That's Fred. He thinks because he sees big tits everywhere and then still comes home for dinner that I should be welcoming him at the door like some conquering hero. Dr. Lucy smiles. 
DR. LUCY Well, maybe it's time to let them go out there and find out what it's really like. 
MAGGIE Wow. You're talking about the nuclear option. Maggie ponders the idea. 
GRACE And remind me again, what good could possibly come from this...? 
DR. LUCY There's a wonderful principle in psychology called 'reactance theory.' It basically states that if you're constantly told you can't do something, you want to do it more than ever. And conversely, if you remove the taboo, you remove the obsession. Grace makes a 't' sound. 
GRACE 
(SARCASTIC) I got an idea, Doc: Why don't you try a hall pass out on your husband and let us know how it works out. 
DR. LUCY Oh, I have. Grace and Maggie REACT to this. 
MAGGIE You're telling us you let Charlie sleep with another woman? Dr. Lucy takes a moment before answering. 
DR. LUCY I am not telling you that. I am telling you that I gave him the freedom to choose for himself. 
GRACE And...? 
DR. LUCY All I know is...our marriage is better than ever. Grace and Maggie think about this. 
GRACE I don't know. There's a reason that men evolved and apes didn't. It's because women demanded more. Without a wife, Einstein would've been humping a maple tree all day. As the women LAUGH, we 
CUT TO: 
EXT. ED & KIMMY LONG'S ESTATE - DAY 
There are several flashy cars out front of this huge McMansion. As Fred and Grace and Rick and Maggie get out of Fred's mini-van, Ed Long comes out of the house to greet them. (Ed's 5-YEAR-OLD SON is beside him wearing khakis and a Polo shirt, just like his father.) 
GRACE There he is! The lord of the manor! 
ED Come on, everyone in the shack! The grand tour's about to begin! 
INT. STUDY - AFTERNOON 
Ed and his wife KIMMY (late-30's, high-maintenance) lead Rick, Fred, Maggie, Grace, and SEVERAL OTHER GUESTS into a large wood-paneled study. (The Long's 7-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER sticks to her mother's side WEARING A MATCHING DRESS.) 
ED I call it headquarters. LARRY BOHAC, mid-40's, and his blonde bombshell of a wife, MANDY, (who wears A TOO-TIGHT T-SHIRT) look around in awe. 
MANDY Un-believable. 
ED That's sweet of you to say, Mandy. 
LARRY It's epic, Ed. Ed points to one wall which houses a GLASSED-IN HUMIDOR. 
ED 
RICK Look, before we go bagging any chicks, I gotta get a hunk of beef in me. 
GARY Hey, I got a guy over at Outback Steak House who could set us up. 
BAKER Ooooh, he's got pull over at Outback. Wow. 
RICK Hey, I like Outback. Let's chug these and hit the road. 
As the guys drink up, Hog-head puts his arm around Gary. 
HOG-HEAD Hey, Gar, you don't happen to have any connections at 7/11, do ya? Maybe someone could hook me up with a player's card so I can cut right to the front of the raspberry slurpy line. The guys all LAUGH, as we 
CUT TO: 
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF CAPE COD BEACH COTTAGE - NIGHT This is an old summer shack nestled on a quiet bluff overlooking the sound. 
INT. BEACH COTTAGE - SAME 
Grace stands at the window staring out on the ocean, while Maggie nestles on the couch reading a summer novel. The kids are asleep and the place is quiet. 
GRACE I think we might've made a huge mistake. 
MAGGIE Stop thinking about it, Grace. Why don t you just try to get some sleep? Grace turns to Maggie. 
GRACE Sleep? I can't sleep. I don't understand you--how can you Just sit there and read knowing that Rick could be making out with a supermodel right now? Maggie doesn't answer. 
GRACE (CONT'D) Our husbands aren't married this week. Do you know what husbands do when they're not married? 
MAGGIE Shh. You're going to wake the kids. 
GRACE Are you going to sit there and tell me you're not the least bit concerned about what they're doing right now? Maggie SIGHS. 
MAGGIE Okay... I'm a little concerned. 
Grace flops into the chair across from her. 
MAGGIE (CONT'D) Of course I'm concerned. But what choice did we have? 
GRACE We could've kept the status quo. I mean, were things really that bad that we had to try something this extreme? 
MAGGIE For me they were. 
(BEAT) Look, you may call this a hall pass, but for me it's more of a Hail Mary pass. I'm serious, I don't know what else to do. Grace looks at Maggie, surprised. 
MAGGIE (CONT'D) Remember last week when we went to Lucy's award thing? Grace nods. 
MAGGIE (CONT'D) That night when we got home, Rick and I were gonna.. .you know... and I was waiting for him in bed while he tucked the kids in, and I started wondering who he would be thinking about during sex. Would it be the girl he checked out on the way into the party? Or would it be Missy Frankenfield--because I noticed him gawking at her? Or how about one of the waitresses, or maybe somebody he saw at work that day? Then when he came into the room, I did something I'd never done before: I pretended to be asleep. 
GRACE You're kidding me? You've never done that? I do that all the time! Maggie almost smiles. 
MAGGIE Look, I understand that people have fantasies and that you're not always thinking about the person you're with. 
GRACE That's for sure. 
MAGGIE But it's just...I don't know... it's been too long since I felt that he was thinking about me. 
They sit there for a moment, quiet. Then: 
MAGGIE (CONT'D) I need this hall pass to work, Grace, because if it doesn't, I don't know what's going to happen. 
CUT TO: 
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF OUTBACK STEAKHOUSE - NIGHT We see two VERY OLD COUPLES walking out with doggie bags. 
INT. OUTBACK STEAKHOUSE - SAME 
Our five guys are in a MEAT COMA, slouched in their chairs nursing red wines and talking through PURPLE TEETH. Several 
EMPTY WINE BOTTLES, MARTINI GLASSES, HALF-EATEN STEAKS, CARVED UP POTATO AU GRATIN and CREAMED SPINACH PLATES, and MANGLED KEY-LIME PIES litter the table. 
BAKER Okay... so where to now? Rick can't think in this state. 
RICK Fred...? 
FRED Hm? 
RICK Answer Baker. 
FRED What's the question? 
RICK What are we doing for the rest of the night? 
FRED 
(DISINTERESTED) I don't know. Getting laid, right? 
HOG-HEAD I gotta go home and poo. 
RICK You don't even have a hall pass. 
HOG-HEAD So? I can still live vicariously through you guys, can't I? 
RICK It's not vicarious if you're actually doing it. 
HOG-HEAD Whatever. Just hit your ball. Hog-Head takes ANOTHER BITE. 
FRED Oh, what the hell, it's not like my game can get any worse. 
Rick watches Fred pick up a brownie and TENTATIVELY TASTE IT. Then Gary INHALES HIS IN ONE BITE. 
RICK All right, give me one of those things. As Rick drops his club and walks toward the brownies, we 
SUPER: 
75 MINUTES LATER 
EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY 
A dazed and confused Rick and Fred are RECLINING in their cart in the middle of the fairway. For a while neither of them speak. Then: 
FRED What kind of soap do you use? 
RICK 
(BEAT) You mean in the shower? 
FRED Yeah. 
RICK Dove. 
FRED Yeah, I like Dove--it doesn't dry your skin so much. Fred stares into space. 
FRED (CONT'D) Sometimes it's hard to wash off, though. Because of the moisturizer. You ever notice--? 
RICK I think Hog-head's dead. Fred looks over and sees Hog-head SPRAWLED OUT ON HIS BACK IN A SAND TRAP. He's not moving. 
FRED 
(CALLING OUT) Hog-head...? Are you okay? As Hog-head starts to make SNOW ANGELS IN THE SAND, an elderly COURSE RANGER pulls up in a golf cart. 
RANGER What the hell is he doing? Rick and Fred grow visibly tense at the sight of an authority figure. 
RICK Uh, he's having back spasms. 
RANGER Not him. Him. Rick and Fred turn and see Gary STANDING CHEST-DEEP in the MIDDLE OF A POND just STARING AT THEM. 
RICK 
(CALLING OUT) Gary! What are you doing?! 
GARY I don't know--you tell me! Gary starts to LAUGH MANIACALLY. The Ranger turns to Rick, annoyed. 
RANGER Look, this is the third time I've had to flag your group and you're only on the fourth hole. Now if I have to come out here again, you're done for the day. 
RICK Gotcha. We'll pick it up, sir. The Ranger shoots them a look and DRIVES OFF toward the TWO ASIAN FOURSOMES waiting on the tee behind them. 
CUT TO: 
SUPER: 
27 MINUTES LATER 
EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY 
The four guys are unnaturally bunched together on another fairway. 
RICK Think. Where did you last see it? 
GARY On the course. 
RICK Where on the course? 
GARY I don't know--on a fairway, I think. I clot out, grabbed my club, took a swing, and when I turned around it had disappeared. 
RICK You're serious? You're telling us you lost your golf cart? 
FRED 
(STONER VOICE) Dude, where's my golf cart? 
RICK Shut up, Fred. 
HOG-HEAD Guys, I gotta go poo again. 
GARY I didn't lose it, I think it was stolen. 
RICK COLEMAN I hate to break it to you but your old man's the one who's been taking all the money--he's a thief. Maggie's Father LAUGHS. 
RICK COLEMAN (CONT'D) Hey, everyone's coming back to my place for some beers and a barbecue- -why don't you join us? 
MAGGIE Oh, thanks, but we've gotta get the kids home. 
MAGGIE'S FATHER Your mom and I will take 'em home. You two go out and have a good time- -cripes, you haven't been out all week. Grace perks up at this. 
MAGGIE Oh, I don't know, Dad, we really 
HADN'T PLANNED-- 
GRACE Excuse me, can I have a word with you? Grace pulls Maggie aside. 
GRACE (CONT'D) 
(WHISPERING) What's your problem? 
MAGGIE Oh, come on, Grace, these guys are barely out of college, and, in case you've forgotten, we're married. 
GRACE To who? Last I heard, Rick and Fred had the week off from marriage. So remind me again--who are we married to? Maggie thinks about this. 
MAGGIE Well...I guess one beer won't kill us. 
GRACE 
(SMILING) That's my girl. Grace glances over at the ballplayers. 
GRACE (CONT'D) Why shouldn't we have fun? God knows our guys are living it up. 
CUT TO: 
A CLOSE-UP OF HOG-HEAD 
HOG-HEAD What would you guys rather do--make- out with a guy or let him blow you? PULL BACK TO REVEAL that... 
INT. ESPN SPORTS ZONE BAR - CONTINUOUS 
.Our five guys are sitting at the bar drinking beer and devouring plates of HOT WINGS. Around them we see about fifty TV's BLARING twenty different sporting events. There's ESPN logos everywhere and not a woman in sight. 
HOG-HEAD (CONT'D) And you've gotta pick one or someone in your family will die-- that's the rule. 
GARY Oh boy, that's a toughie. 
FRED How long would you have to make-out with him? 
HOG-HEAD Ten minutes. 
RICK Tongue? 
HOG-HEAD Of course. 
FRED And how long would he have to blow you? 
HOG-HEAD Seven minutes. 
GARY Oof. I mean, getting blown by a dude is bad, but making out with a guy, it's so.. .intimate. 
RICK You think it's more intimate than getting blown by a guy? 
GARY Way more. 
BAKER All right, the hell with this shit, I'm outta here. Baker gets up from his stool. 
RICK 
(TAKEN ABACK) What? Why? 
BAKER I wanted to watch you guys pick up chicks, not talk about dicks. 
FRED Hey, greased lightning, let off the gas--sometimes these things take time. 
GARY Baker's right. This is day three and you haven't even talked to a girl. 
RICK 
(POINTED) That's not exactly accurate, Gary. Thanks to your scrumptious brownies, I did spend half of last night talking to Judy on the drug- and-poison hotline. Hog-head and Gary stand. 
HOG-HEAD I guess I'm gonna get going, too. 
GARY Yeah, this is boring. You guys are pussies. 
FRED Hey, I haven't seen you guys talk to any girls. 
BAKER We don't have hall passes! 
(SHAKES HEAD) Come on, guys, let's go. The three friends start to leave but Hog-head stops and turns. 
RICK COLEMAN Nice try. 
(BEAT) So how about yourself--how long you been married? 
MAGGIE Uh...fourteen years. We were college sweethearts. 
RICK COLEMAN Nice. And where is he this week? 
MAGGIE He's up in Boston. 
RICK COLEMAN Poor guy. All work and no play, huh? Maggie forces a smile. 
MAGGIE Something like that. Suddenly Grace is PROPELLED OUT OF THE WATER and UP ONTO 
GERRY'S SHOULDERS. 
GRACE Stop it! What are you doing?! 
Gerry LAUGHS and BOUNCES AROUND THE POOL and Grace and Maggie and the coach can't help but LAUGH along with him, as we 
CUT TO: 
EXT. RAMADA INN - NIGHT 
Rick and Fred pull into the hotel's lot in the mini-van. As Rick gets out, Fred reaches behind his seat and comes out clutching a MOTORCYCLE HELMET. Rick stares at him. 
FRED 
(DEFENSIVE) Chicks dig motorcycles. 
INT. RAMADA INN OLDIE'S BAR - NIGHT 
It's 80's night and a Hall & Oates cover band is PLAYING complete with look-alikes, except Oates is black. Behind the band there's a banner that reads: 'Ramada Inn proudly welcomes the Mutual of Omaha Leadership Council!' We see middle-aged CORPORATE TYPES everywhere. 
DARRYL HALL 
(SINGING) ". .Oh-oh here she comes, watch out boy she'll chew you up. Oh-oh here she comes, she's a maneater..." ANGLE ON THE BAR where Rick and Fred are checking out the scene. Fred is WEARING THE HELMET. (It's a huge BLACK, OVERSIZED HELMET WITH A VISOR.) He pulls it off, SHAKES OUT HIS HAIR, and places it prominently ON THE BAR. 
FRED Jackpot, baby. Rick NOTICES SOMETHING O.S.. 
RICK How about those two? ANGLE ON two pretty LATINO WOMEN sitting alone at a table. 
FRED Ooh, yeah. Daddy likes. Fred pulls a piece of paper out of his back pocket and hands it to Rick. 
RICK What's this? 
FRED I went on-line this afternoon and wrote down some good pick-up lines to break the ice. 
RICK 
(READING) 'Hi. Will you help me find my puppy? I think he ran into the cheap hotel across the street.' 
FRED That's a good one--except for one thing: We don't have a puppy, so when she gets there she'll realize we're full of shit. Rick shoots him a look. 
RICK I don't think it's supposed to be for real. It's just to make her laugh so she'll talk to you. Fred considers this. 
FRED Oh God no, it doesn't work on that level. Here, this is my favorite. He takes the paper from Rick. 
FRED (CONT'D) 
(READING) 'You must be from Ireland because when I look at you my penis is Dublin.' 
RICK It's a charmer but you know what? We don't need phony pick-up lines. Why don't we just be ourselves? 
FRED Great. If you know how to. Rick takes a DEEP BREATH and braces himself. 
RICK Give me the helmet. Fred hands him the helmet, then Rick marches up to the two Latino Women with the helmet under his arm and Fred close on his heels. 
RICK (CONT'D) Hi. The women give him a pleasant look. 
LATINO WOMAN #1 Hello. Fred gives a little wave from behind Rick. 
FRED Hola. LONG BEAT as Rick tries to figure what to say next. Then: 
RICK Well.. .this is awkward. I feel like I'm back at my first junior high school mixer. 
Rick and Fred force a LAUGH and the girls smile. Another LONG, UNCOMFORTABLE BEAT. Rick clears his throat. 
RICK CONT'D) So...are you ladies from Ireland? 
LATINO WOMAN #2 No. 
RICK. I'm very surprised to hear that news, because when I look at you my penis doubles in size. The women FLINCH at this, losing their smiles. Fred leans in. 
FRED No, he means his dick is Dublin. Like the city. In Ireland. As the girls turn away from them, we begin a... MUSIC MONTAGE - Hall & Oates' I Can't Go For That plays as our GUYS GET SHOT DOWN by a DOZEN DIFFERENT BEAUTIFUL WOMEN. 
END MONTAGE 
GRACE What are you doing here? He KICKS OFF THE SKI, then runs over and SHAKES HIS WET BODY 
ALL OVER THE GIRLS. 
GRACE & MAGGIE Gerry, stop it! 
GERRY Hey, where are the kiddies? We thought we'd take you all for a boat ride. 
MAGGIE My parents took them to Martha's Vineyard for the weekend. Just then, we hear a LOUD HORN. They look up to see the boat pulling close to shore. Rick Coleman is behind the wheel and a couple PLAYERS are in the back. Maggie waves. 
RICK COLEMAN 
(THROUGH BULLHORN) All right, everybody aboard! We're going waterskiing! The two women look at each other--why not? As they get up and RUN INTO THE WATER, we

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY 
Rick stands in line at the coffee shop looking casual in slacks and a Harvard t-shirt. Music plays. He peers ahead and sees the Wannabe Artist-Type taking the order of a TEENAGE GIRL. At the other register, Coffee Girl is also taking orders. Rick is hoping to get Coffee Girl but Wannabe gets to him first. 
WANNABE Can I take your order? Rick sees that there's no one behind him. He turns to the Wannabe. 
RICK Uh...I don't know what I want. Wannabe stares at him, waiting. Rick hesitates a few moments, then levels with the guy. 
RICK (CONT'D) Look, man, I want her to take my order. 
WANNABE Why? 
RICK Uh, she knows how I like it. 
WANNABE 
(ATTITUDE) Little help, Leigh--your unique barista skills have been requested. Rick waves weakly to Leigh and winks. As Leigh approaches, Wannabe mocks Rick by waving at him and winking. 
LEIGH Hi. What would you like? Rick was hoping to have a conversation but Wannabe is crowding them. 
RICK Iced coffee. With two Splendas. Leigh rings him up. 
LEIGH That'll be two dollars. Rick hands her a fiver and nods toward the speakers. 
RICK By the way, nice tunes. Do you choose 'em or do they come down from corporate? 
LEIGH Me. It's Snow Patrol. 
She hands Rick his change and he dumps it in the tip jar. 
RICK Nice soundtrack. Pretty solid movie, too. Wannabe BARKS out a LAUGH. 
WANNABE Dude, you're thinking of Snow Do s-- the Cuba Gooding kiddie flick. This is Snow Patrol, the band. Rick shrugs, a little embarrassed. 
LEIGH Thanks for the tip. As Leigh grabs a cup and goes to make the coffee, Wannabe SAYS SOMETHING to her that WE CAN'T HEAR and they both LAUGH. A PHONE RINGS in the employee room. Leigh hands Wannabe the coffee, then runs back to answer it. Wannabe hands Rick the iced coffee and winks at him. 
WANNABE Enjoy your two-Splenda'd iced coffee, mister. Rick starts to go, then turns around and stares at Wannabe. Wannabe, comforted by the counter between them, smiles back. 
RICK Why are you smiling? You think this counter is some alligator-infested moat? Rick's stare becomes a glare and Wannabe loses his smile. 
RICK (CONT'D) This little 'I'm-on-the-inside, too- cool-for-school, let's-laugh-at-the- 
DORKY-SUBURBAN-GUY-CAUSE-I'M-SAFE- 
ON-THIS-SIDE-OF-THE-COUNTER' routine's gonna get you hurt. After you lose all of your family's money on your avante garde piece of crap short film, you're going to need a job. And it's guys like me that hire. And guys like me don't hire punks like you. So shape up. As Rick turns and walks out, we PAN over to see that Leigh 
HAS BEEN WATCHING THIS. 
EXT. COFFEE SHOP - A FEW MINUTES LATER 
Rick sits alone at a table on the sidewalk drinking his coffee. He NOTICES some postcards advertising a two-week free trial at the local gym and starts to read them. 
LEIGH (O.S.) I work-out there. 
Rick looks up, suddenly finding himself alone with Leigh. 
RICK You do? Leigh nods and starts to straighten up the tables. 
RICK (CONT'D) I work-out at home, but I was thinking of going public with my work-outs. What do you squat? She seems amused by this. 
LEIGH I don't really squat, just run on the hamster-wheel everyday after work. She starts wiping down a table. 
COFFEE GIRL So did you go to Harvard? She nods at Rick's t-shirt. 
RICK Yeah. 
(BEAT) I mean, you know...I went to a party there once. Coffee Girl GIGGLES and Rick perks up. 
RICK (CONT'D) 
(RE:SHIRT) Actually, this is Harvard Health Care. Sleep apnea... snoring too much. (holds up gym postcard) So is this a good place to join? 
SONG .Night fever, night fever.. .we know how to do it...' As the song heats up, the crowd parts, REVEALING... Rick Coleman and Gerry decked-out in WHITE, TONY-MANARO-SUITS. They're DANCING UP A STORM with Maggie and Grace who are thrilled to be in such capable hands. Grace is getting tossed around a bit, but it's clear that Maggie can hold her own on a dance floor. 
The crowd soon FORMS A CIRCLE around the two couples, and as Rick and Gerry SWING AND LIFT our delighted and breathless wives, we 
CUT TO: 
SAME SCENE - LATER Maggie and Rick Coleman are standing at the rail of the boat taking a breather. 
RICK COLEMAN Wow. You can really move out there. Maggie shrugs modestly. 
MAGGIE Thanks. I was a dance major in college. 
RICK COLEMAN Really? I always wondered--what do you do with a degree in dance? 
MAGGIE Well, as it turned out, nothing. 
(BLUSHING) I guess the original plan was to go to New York and try to hook-up with one of the big dance companies, but then I got married and. . .your priorities change. She looks away, maybe a little embarrassed. 
MAGGIE (CONT'D) Anyway, that was fun. I haven't danced this much in a long time. 
RICK COLEMAN Why not? 
MAGGIE I don't know, you get busy, kids, school, there's so much going on. 
RICK COLEMAN Well you gotta make time for the stuff you love or you'll forget who you are. Maggie appreciates the sentiment. She makes strong eye- contact with Rick for a moment, but catches herself and looks away. 
MAGGIE You know, my husband's name is Rick. Rick smiles at this. 
RICK COLEMAN Well that makes me the perfect guy to have an affair with--you'd never have to worry about screaming out the wrong name during sex. Maggie smiles at this, but she seems a nick uncomfortable. 
RICK COLEMAN (CONT'D) I'm kidding. 
MAGGIE I know. 
RICK COLEMAN Now come on, let's go find Grace and get something to eat. I'm starving. As they head back to the party, we 
CUT TO: 
INT. RICK'S TOYOTA AVALON - LATE AFTERNOON 
Rick is parked across the street from FITNESS FIRM HEALTH CLUB. He's reading the newspaper and glancing at the entrance for Leigh. Suddenly there's a LOUD TAP on the window and Rick looks over to see Flats (who we met at Rick's poker night) standing outside with a shit-eating grin. Rick rolls down the window. 
FLATS Hey, Rick. 
RICK 
(STARTLED) Oh...hey, Flats. How you doing, man? 
FLATS Great. What's up with you? How's that hall pass thing going? Rick makes a Scooby Doo sound, alarmed. 
RICK Who told you about that--was it Hog- head? 
FLATS No. Some old lady was yakking about it down at the post office. Rick REACTS to this. 
FLATS (CONT'D) 
(BIG SMILE) So what's the deal--you getting laid? 
RICK 
(DEFENSIVE) What? No. 
RICK (CONT'D) I don't know where you're getting your information, Flats, but a hall pass isn't just about getting laid, it's about getting a week off from marriage to do as you please-- whether that be fishing, or watching TV, whatever it is that relaxes you. 
FLATS 
(DUBIOUS) Oh, I didn't know that. Just then Rick NOTICES Leigh (dressed in work-out clothes) walking down the sidewalk toward the gym. 
RICK Uh, Flatsy, I gotta run. I'm late for my work-out appointment. When Rick hops out of his car, we see that he's wearing gym shorts and an old Springsteen t-shirt. He hesitates, then grabs a SWEATSHIRT out of the car and TIES IT AROUND HIS WAIST. Rick hurries down the sidewalk toward Leigh. 
RICK (CONT'D) Hey, girl! 
LEIGH 
(SMILING) All right! You decided to go for it. As Rick follows Leigh into the gym, a smiling Flats CALLS 
OUT: 
FLATS Hey, Rick! Good luck with the fishing! As Flats begins to LAUGH, a sheepish Rick scurries into the building. 
INT. FITNESS FIRM HEALTH CLUB - MOMENTS LATER 
Rick and Leigh stand at the front desk. A young, buff dude, CLYDE, looks up from folding towels. 
LEIGH Clyde, this is my friend, uh... 
RICK Rick. 
FRED (CONT'D) 
(WITH MOUTH-FULL) I envisioned a national holiday, right between July 4th and Labor Day, like the first Friday in August, Hall Pass Day; a day for husbands to get some strange, a day that would forever be known as the holiday,that saved the institution of marriage. 
RICK All right, don't give up. 
FRED I'm not giving up, I'm facing facts- -this is our last day and we got nothing cooking. Maybe you were right. Maybe we should just tell the girls to come home. 
RICK No. I want the hall pass. Fred looks at Rick, surprised. 
RICK (CONT'D) At first I wasn't sure, but now I want the dream. 
FRED I'm not even sure I know what the dream is anymore. 
RICK I just...I just want to know what it's like to be with another woman. 
FRED Well, just pull up one of the golden oldies in your spank bank-- it's almost like being there. 
RICK I don't have anything in that spank bank. 
FRED I'm talking about all the girls before you met Maggie. Rick doesn't say anything. 
FRED (CONT'D) What? 
(BEAT) No, you're not serious? Rick lowers his head. 
FRED (CONT'D) Wait a second, are you saying...? 
(BEAT) But how can that be--you didn't meet Maggie until college? 
RICK 
(DEFENSIVE) Yeah, so? What do you think, everyone gets laid in high school? I got news for you, mister--getting laid in high school is not a right, it's a privilege. Fred puts down his ice cream. Rick SIGHS. 
RICK (CONT'D) First class, first day, freshman year, I saw Maggie--she was sitting three seats away in Western Civ-- and I fell in love instantly. I begged her for three months to go out with me, she finally caved, and that night I told her I loved her. 
RICK (CONT'D) Eighty-four days later she told me she loved me back and we've been together ever since. Fred stares at him. 
FRED Wow. That's a really creepy story. Just then Fred's cell phone RINGS and he ANSWERS it. 
FRED (CONT'D) Hello. 
(BEAT) Yeah. 
(BEAT) Oh, okay, great. Fred hangs up but doesn't say anything. 
RICK Who was that? 
FRED Just an angel from heaven. Suddenly Fred jumps to his feet. 
FRED (CONT'D) Coakley's back in town! As Rick's face fills with renewed hope, we... 
CUT TO: 
INT. BEACH COTTAGE - AFTERNOON 
Maggie and Grace are sitting at the kitchen table gazing at a BOUQUET OF FLOWERS and an open GIFT BOX displaying an 
ENGRAVED I.D. BRACELET. 
MAGGIE Does this mean you're going steady? 
GRACE 
(GUILTY) That's not funny. I feel terrible-- the poor kid's spending all his hard-earned money on me--that's sad. Cute, but sad. 
MAGGIE Grace, you should be flattered. You're thirty-eight-years-old and college kids are still swooning over you. 
GRACE Well I just feel bad if I gave him the wrong impression. 
MAGGIE The wrong impression? What makes you think that--I mean, besides the flowers, I.D. bracelet, and love letter? Maggie picks up a card. 
MAGGIE (CONT'D) 
(READING) 'Dearest Grace--Our final game is tonight. Please meet me at the coach's place afterwards to celebrate. Yours truly, Gerry.' 
GRACE Thanks for piling on. Grace stands up and SIGHS. 
GRACE (CONT'D) Well...I can't accept this. I guess I'm just gonna have to go set him straight.

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF A PIZZERIA UNO - NIGHT 
INT. PIZZERIA UNO - SAME 
Rick and Fred are sitting at a table sharing a pizza while Fred texts someone. 
PAIGE (CONT'D) In fact, I thought it was very classy of you to be staying at the Holiday Inn Express instead of bringing girls back to your home with all the kids' pictures and schoolwork taped up everywhere. Rick forces a smile. 
RICK Thank you. A male BARTENDER, 25, finally appears in front of Rick. 
RICK (CONT'D) Yeah, um, two bottles of Moet and six glasses please. Paige eyes Rick as she sips her drink. 
PAIGE So does it work both ways? 
RICK What? 
PAIGE The hall pass. Does your wife get one, too. 
RICK 
(AMUSED) Uh, no, no. A hall pass is for men only. 
PAIGE Oh. Who made that rule? 
RICK Well ...um... As Rick thinks about this, Paige moves in tighter. 
PAIGE By the way, I kind of owe you an apology. (lowers her voice, 
BASH Last week ful) when you drove me home, I shouldn't have snapped at you like that. 
RICK Oh, don't worry about it. It was a big misunderstanding. 
PAIGE No, it wasn't. She takes a moment, looks around. 
PAIGE (CONT'D) If you thought I was coming on to you that night, it's because...I was. Rick flinches at this. Just then the Bartender returns with the champagne. Rick fumbles through his pocket and finally pays. Then he's left alone with Paige and her coed-in-love- with-the-professor eyes and her suddenly heaving cleavage. 
RICK Yeah. Um...I have to go, Paige, but it was great seeing you. Paige grabs Rick's arm as he tries to go. She looks suddenly annoyed. 
PAIGE Are you serious? You're doing this again... even with a hall pass? 
RICK Paige, you're my kids' babysitter. Have a happy birthday. As Rick walks away, we go BACK ON COAKLEY AND FRED as Rick arrives with the champagne. 
COAKLEY Here we go, bubbles doth floweth. 
FRED Holy crap... look who's here. The guys turn to see the coffee girl, Leigh, walking past with two of her GIRLFRIENDS. She sees them and LIGHTS UP. 
LEIGH Hey, Rick! What happened yesterday-- I thought we were gonna grab a beer? Fred looks at Rick, confused. 
RICK 
(SHEEPISH) Yeah, I got a little caught up in my curls and reps and shit. 
(CHANGING SUBJECT) So is this your playground? 
LEIGH Nah, I've never been here, but a friend of mine's DJ-ing tonight so I promised him I'd come. Just then Wannabe from the coffee shop swoo s in and gives Leigh a kiss on the cheek. He has a pair of headphones hanging around his neck. 
WANNABE Wassup, girl? 
Wannabe NOTICES Rick and loses his smile. 
WANNABE (CONT'D) Oh. Hey. What are you doing here-- you auditing the place? 
RICK Actually, I work for Sirius XM Radio--we're looking to hire some new deejays so I'm checking out all the clubs. Wannabe stiffens, suddenly respectful. 
WANNABE Oh. Cool. Are you serious? 
RICK Not! Leigh is amused by this, but she tries to hide it from the deflated Wannabe. 
WANNABE 
(ANNOYED) Oh, that's hip. Real fresh. (turns to Leigh) Why don't you hit the dance floor-- the next song's gonna be for you. As Leigh's Girlfriends pull her onto the dance floor, Wannabe returns to his deejay booth. 
FRED 
(GLARING) Beer? When were you two going to have a beer? 
RICK 
(GUILTY) No, no, no, Leigh and I just belong to the same gym and happened to be there at the same time yesterday afternoon. 
FRED What gym do you belong to and where the hell was I? 
COAKLEY Well, according to Kimmy Long, you were at the massage parlor trying to get a rub-and-tug without filling out the paperwork. This takes the wind out of Fred's sails. 
RICK What? Coakley CHUCKLES and Rick glares at Fred. 
RICK (CONT'D) I thought the massage parlor was admitting defeat? 
FRED I had a knot in my neck--why the hell didn't you tell me you saw Coffee Girl?! 
COAKLEY Okay, guys, cut the crap. We're all here for the same thing. And I'll give you a hint what that thing is: It begins with a 'P' and ends with an 'ussy.' Coakley puts his arm around Fred. 
COAKLEY (CONT'D) Now relax, Fredd , everyone's gonna get taken care ot. (looks out at crowd) We Just gotta find you a gazelle with a bad wheel. 
FRED 
(DEADPAN) If they came right now I would, sure. 
MISSY FRANKENFIELD (O.S.) There you are! Fred looks up to see Missy Frankenfield approaching. 
FRED Oh my god! You're here! Fred jumps off the bed and gives Missy a hug. 
FRED (CONT'D) Franken-berry, how the heck are ya?! She returns the embrace, but not quite as tight. 
FRED (CONT'D) You look incredible! 
MISSY FRANKENFIELD 
(CLEARLY UNCOMFORTABLE) Thanks, Fred, you look good, too. 
FRED Never felt better. Missy nods. 
MISSY FRANKENFIELD I have to say, I can't believe I'm actually here--I was on my way home from dinner when I noticed your text. So what's this big emergency? 
FRED Huh? Oh, uh, yeah. By 'emergency' I just meant that there's some important stuff I want to talk to you about. You know, one on one, me and you--without all the husbands and wives and hoopla. So how are you? 
MISSY FRANKENFIELD I'm... good. 
FRED No, I mean how-are-you. Inside. What's happenin' in there? There must be all sorts of emotions churning up with the divorce and everything. She gives him a long look. 
MISSY FRANKENFIELD Maybe we should go somewhere else-- this doesn't seem like the best place to spill one's guts. Just then, Coakley swoops in and pulls Fred aside. 
COAKLEY 
(UNDER BREATH) What part of 'go ugly early' didn't you understand? You've got a better chance of winning husband-of-the- year than tagging that chiquita. Fred flinches at this. 
FRED But...I know her. She said she wants to leave with me. 
COAKLEY Then she's insane--run for the hills. 
FRED Coak, the woman's going through a divorce. She's not insane, she's just making really poor decisions right now. (hands him his car keys) Here, give Rick the keys to my mini- van. I'm gonna go back to the hotel with Missy. Coakley looks back at Missy and softens. 
COAKLEY It's your funeral, princess. BACK ON RICK AND LEIGH dancing up a storm. Rick is OUT OF BREATH and SWEATING LIKE A PIG. His shirt is soaked and his hair is dripping wet. 
LEIGH Are you okay--you keep checking your pulse? 
RICK Nah, I'm fine. I had a little chest cramp during the last song, but I worked through it. She smiles at this. 
LEIGH Come on, let's sit this one out. I need a breather. They move to the bar and Rick starts DRYING HIMSELF with a stack of cocktail napkins. 
LEIGH (CONT'D) So what's up with the ring? He looks at his finger, then back at her. 
RICK Um...have you ever heard of a hall pass?

EXT. BALL TEAM BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT 
Grace pulls up in her Camry and gets out. She hears MUSIC coming from inside and hesitates a BEAT before walking nervously onto the porch and KNOCKING. A moment later Gerry appears in the doorway. 
GERRY There she is! Come on in, I'm mixing up some margaronis. We lost our final game, but I got four hits! 
GRACE Oh. Great. Uh, where is everyone? 
GERRY They all went out to party--now get in here! But Grace stays on the porch. 
GRACE Gerry, I'm sorry but I can't stay. 
GERRY What? Grace hasn't been in this situation in a long time and it shows. Gerry steps out onto the porch looking concerned. 
GERRY (CONT'D) Is everything okay? 
GRACE Yeah, yeah, everything's fine, but... (holds up gift box) .I can't accept this. 
GERRY Why not? Grace does a double-take. 
GRACE Gerry, I'm a married woman. Gerry nods at this, maybe a little hurt. She hands him the box and he reluctantly accepts it. 
GERRY Um... I'm sorry if I made you uncomfortable, Grace. It's just that...I really like you. 
GRACE I like you, too, Gerry, and you didn't make me uncomfortable. She smiles at him and he forces a smile back, and there's some serious eye-contact, and then BAM! They DIVE AT EACH OTHER and start SUCKING FACE LIKE THERE'S NO TOMORROW. As they continue to MAUL EACH OTHER, they STUMBLE INTO THE HOUSE, and we

INT. ENTER THE DRAGON NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT 
Rick and Leigh are leaning against the bar. 
LEIGH So...you're married? 
RICK I wasn't deliberately hiding it. He holds up his ring hand. 
AUNT MEG Rick, my name's Meg. I'm your babysitter Paige's aunt, and I just wanted to come over here and tell you this: They don't make men like you anymore. She smiles. 
FRED Oh. Well, thank you.

GERRY Everything okay? 
GRACE Yeah. Yeah. It's just ...no, everything's not okay. 
GERRY What? He moves close to her and she grows uncomfortable. 
GRACE Look, you're a great cguy, Gerry, and you're very charming and very sweet and the last thing I wanted to do was hurt your feelings, but...well, what,just happened can never happen again. Gerry looks confused. 
GERRY Oh. 
GRACE I know it's probably hard for you to understand but...I love my husband. 
GERRY So? What does that have to do with anything? Fate threw us together and we went with it--isn't that what life's all about? 
Grace looks at him, recognizing the youth and triteness of his words. 
GRACE Not always. 
(BEAT) It wasn't fair to my husband... and it wasn't fair to you because this could never become anything more than just.. .what it was. She looks at him and shrugs apologetically. Gerry BARKS out a LAUGH. 
GERRY I know that. 
GRACE You do? 
GERRY 
(BIG SMILE) Of course I do. Jeez. I mean, no offense, but let's face it, you're a lot older than me. She flinches, a little embarrassed. A quick reality check for Grace. 
GRACE Right. 
GERRY I don't mean that in a bad way. I'm just saying, I didn't think we were going to start dating, you know? Could you imagine the looks we'd get? It'd be like Hugh Hefner and his girlfriends--except in reverse. Gerry CHUCKLES. 
GERRY (CONT'D) You'd be Hugh Hefner. 
GRACE Yeah, I got that part. Gerry looks at his watch. 
GERRY Ooh, I gotta get going. We have kind of a team meeting in like twenty minutes. Gerry sees Grace glance at the clock: 12:15 A.M. 
GERRY CONT'D It's, uh, kind o a tradition that we always get together on the night of the last game. It would probably be uncool if I missed it. 
GRACE You don't have to explain. 
GERRY Seriously, though, thanks for everything--that was awesome. He holds up his hand and she diligently HIGH-FIVES HIM. Then Gerry WALKS OUT THE DOOR. Grace sits there alone for a moment. We PUSH IN ON HER and we hear Gerry's CAR START OUTSIDE, and when Grace STARTS TO CRY, we

This is a Tudor home in an upscale Brookline neighborhood. We can hear 'Rage Against The Machine' BLASTING from the street. There's thirty or so cars out front and PEOPLE are still arriving. 
INT. COAKLEY'S HOUSE - SAME 
The place is JAMMING. It's a nice house but under-furnished in a bachelor pad kind of way. Rick and Leigh are in a corner drinking beers. 
LEIGH I guess I still have a lot to get out of my system before I do the marriage trip. I'm one of those people who wants to try everything once before I die. 
RICK 
(BLURTING OUT) Have you ever been with a married guy? Leigh pauses, but she doesn't flinch. 
LEIGH No. 
RICK Neither have I. Rick winces, but Leigh smiles at him. It's the moment of truth. 
RICK (CONT'D) I'd like to help you take being with a married guy off your list of things to do before you die. 
LEIGH You would? 
RICK Yes. Leigh gets close. 
LEIGH I don't want to be a home-wrecker. 
RICK I've got a one-time pass, remember? 
LEIGH That wasn't just a line? 
RICK Really? So...how's it going? 
BOSHANE Solid. Very solid. 
LEARY We're building mucho momentumo. Baker makes a JERK-OFF MOTION. 
LEARY (CONT'D) 
(ANNOYED) Hey, Baker, a hall pass ain't just about sex, you know. 
BOSHANE That's right. It's about going bowling and, uh, staying up late, and being able to do what you want to do when you want to do it. 
RICK Haven't gotten laid yet, huh? 
BOSHANE 
(DISPIRITED) It's a lot tougher than we thought it would be. Just then Gary comes around a corner. 
GARY Hey, dudes, there's like ten very bangable chicks out on the back deck--let's go! Leary HOLDS UP HIS BEER. 
LEARY To freedom! The guys TAP their beer cups, then EXIT toward the back deck. A dejected and defeated Rick watches them go, then turns and pushes his way through the crowd to the front door. As he OPENS THE DOOR to leave, he finds himself FACE-TO-FACE WITH 
LEIGH. 
LEIGH Hey, where are you going? 
RICK What are you doing...? I thought you'd left. 
LEIGH No. I told you, I just had to talk him off the ledge. I calmed him down and sent him on his way. 
RICK Oh. Uh, great. 
LEIGH So where's that game room? I thought we were gonna play some games. She smiles and takes his hand and as they walk away, we go... 
INT. COAKLEY'S HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT 
Rick and Leigh walk down the hall to the game room. He opens the door and flips on the light. THEIR POV - there's a pool table, a few pinball machines, a bar, and a bed. 
LEIGH I'll be right back--I just have to use the bathroom. Rick nods, then watches as Leigh walks off and disappears into the bathroom. He takes a DEEP BREATH. This is it. Just then he hears O.S. LAUGHTER. Rick heads down the hallway and pushes open a door. 
COAKLEY (O.S.) Hey. REVERSE ANGLE reveals Coakley SITTING ALL ALONE in a small study off the hall. He has a bowl of Cap'n Crunch on his lap and is watching a re-run of The Andy Griffith Show. 
RICK Hey. How come you're not downstairs partying? Coakley gives him a sad, worn-out smile. 
COAKLEY All partied out, pal. Rick nods, understanding. Coakley LAUGHS once again at the 
TV. 
COAKLEY (CONT'D) Man, that Barney Fife still kills me. He looks back to Rick. 
COAKLEY (CONT'D) Hey, I was thinking about this hall- pass business. It's really ironic, isn't it? Rick glances down the hall to see if Leigh has returned. 
RICK How's that? 
COAKLEY Well think about it. There's two kinds of guys who cheat on their wives: The guy who does it behind her back, and a guy like you who has his wife's permission. 
RICK Well it's not really cheating if I have permission. 
COAKLEY Yeah, whatever. The point is, if you asked a hundred people who the better CJuy is, ninety-nine of 'em would pick you, because you're being honest--there's no deceit involved. Rick is growing uncomfortable. 
COAKLEY (CONT'D) But the funny thing is, the other guy, the cheater, the bad guy, he has to live with all that guilt and anxiety, while his wife's running around happy as a clam because she doesn't know anything. And you, the good guy, you've got no guilt at all because you just laid it all on your wife's shoulders. 
RICK Well I didn't really think of it 
LIKE-- 
COAKLEY It's like she's your guilt Sherpa! Coakley CHUCKLES and Rick deflates. 
COAKLEY (CONT'D) Funny, huh? 
RICK

COAKLEY And that, my friend, is why you are a genius. As Rick lets this all sink in, we

Paige's Aunt Meg is sitting on the couch. Her legs are crossed revealing a lot of skin. Fred hands her a glass of wine and sits beside her.

AUNT MEG Rick, I hope you don't mind me tracking you down--Paige told me where you were staying. 
FRED Please. Not at all.

INT. RICK & FRED'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 
Fred is still on the couch with Aunt Meg on the floor in front of him. Fred's PANTS ARE DOWN TO HIS ANKLES, leaving him with only his boxers on. Meg KISSES HIS CHEST and STOMACH, then leans back and TAKES OFF HER TANK-TOP, revealing EXTRA-LARGE BAZOOKAS stuffed into a slinky bra. 
AUNT MEG I'm attracted to men with integrity. 
FRED Thanks--wow, you got great jugs. Meg takes Fred's hand and leads him toward the bed (with his pants still at his ankles), Fred WADDLING LIKE A PENGUIN. 
AUNT MEG Moral-guy's a tit-man, huh? 
FRED 
(SHRUGGING) Well, I grew up in the midwest. She pushes him down on the bed and Fred quickly kicks off his pants and shoes (but keeps his boxers on.) Meg TACKLES him and the two of them start to roll around UNDER THE COVERS. An O.S. Fred seems to be working his way down her stomach. 
AUNT MEG Oh yes! Rick... please...I want you to make love to me. Just then Rick BURSTS INTO THE ROOM, out of breath. Fred and Meg come up from under the covers. (Fred is at waist-level on her.) 
RICK Fred, I need to talk to you! Meg GLARES down at Fred, confused. 
AUNT MEG Fred? I thought you were Rick?! 
RICK I'm Rick. Fred cowers guiltily.

EXT. HOLIDAY INN EXPRESS - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER 
Fred, now dressed, hurries across the parking lot with Rick on his heels. Fred has BLOOD-STAINED TISSUE stuffed up his nose. 
FRED What did they tell you? Is Grace gonna be okay? 
RICK All I know is she was in a car accident and they rushed her to the hospital. 
FRED Oh my God... Suddenly they hear O.S. GLASS SHATTERING. They look up and 
REACT. THEIR POV - From fifty yards across the parking lot, they can see that Fred's mini-van's windshield has just been BASHED IN by the BAT-WIELDING Wannabe. On the side of the vehicle is spray-painted: HORNY OLD MAN. 
FRED (CONT'D) Whoa!!! What the hell...?! Wannabe turns to them, a CRAZED LOOK on his face. 
WANNABE How do you like me now, Splenda- boy? 
FRED You moron, that's Lny car! His is the one next to it! Wannabe looks over at Rick's Avalon, PULLS OUT A KNIFE, and quickly SLASHES TWO OF RICK'S TIRES. As Rick and Fred RUN TOWARD HIM, Wannabe JUMPS INTO AN OLD BRONCO and PEELS OUT OF 
THE PARKING LOT. BACK ON Rick and Fred as they slow down and CATCH THEIR 
BREATHS. 
RICK Nice job, Fred.

EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT 
The mini-van blows by a sign that reads 'CAPE COD - 60 
MILES.' 
INT. MINI-VAN - SAME 
The WINDSHIELD IS GONE and the wind blows back Rick and Fred's hair as if they were on a motorcycle. Fred tries his car phone as he drives. 
FRED Oh come on! How can a hospital not have a live operator?! 
RICK It's four in the morning, Fred. Fred hangs up and pounds his steering wheel. 
FRED What was I thinking?! I had a great wife--a beautiful wife--and now I may lose her.. .because of you. 
RICK What are you talking about?! You said our wives were living their dreams, with their fancy gas ovens, and that our dream was the hall pass! How can you blame this on me?! 
FRED I'd never even heard of a hall pass until you flaunted yours in my face! 'Hey, look at me, I've got a hall pass--everyone should have a hall pass!' You ruined my life, Mills!

Maggie and Rick Coleman sit on the back deck DRINKING WINE. 
RICK COLEMAN This is a great place. 
MAGGIE Yeah, my family's had it since I was a kid. We used to come for a week a summer, then two weeks, then a month, then by the time I got to high school we were living here all summer long. 
INT. MINI-VAN - CONTINUOUS 
RICK Oh God, now there's two of 'em! 
FRED I don't care--I'm not stopping 'til we get there! 
RICK Are you crazy?! 
FRED Yeah, I'm crazy! I'm crazy about my wife! 
EXT. CAPE COD HOSPITAL - NIGHT 
Rick and Fred come SKIDDING UP to the EMERGENCY ROOM ENTRANCE in the graffitied mini-van. 
INT. POLICE CRUISER - CONTINUOUS 
The two Young Cops SCREECH to a stop behind the mini-van as the second cruiser flies up behind them. 
COP #2 We're on! The officers spring from their cars and quickly TACKLE Fred as he runs toward the front doors. Rick climbs out of the passenger seat with HIS HANDS RAISED. 
RICK Hear me out, gentlemen, I can explain everything! A BURLY OFFICER from the back-up car form-tackles Rick, BLASTING him backwards onto the sidewalk. Fred and Rick manage to roll away and then CRAWL THROUGH THE 
FRONT ENTRANCE. 
INT. HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Our guys barely get in the door before being PUMMELED TO THE FLOOR by the four cops. The TWO PEOPLE seated in the waiting room STAND UP IN SHOCK and then a swarm of DOCTORS and ORDERLIES come running in to see what the commotion is. 
FRED Grace needs me! Cop #1 PINS FRED'S HEAD TO THE FLOOR as Cop #2 lays across his legs. 
COP #1 Okay, just take it easy, buddy. 
FRED No, I won't take it easy! Look, I'm sorry I was speeding and I shouldn't have run from you guys, but my wife's been in an accident and she's in this emergency room and I gotta see how she is because... 
(GROWS EMOTIONAL) 
.THAT WOMAN'S MY WHOLE LIFE! The cops look moved and unsure what to do. 
DOCTOR Are you the husband of... (glances down at chart) .Grace Searing? Fred strains to look up. 
FRED Yes! Is she okay?! The Doctor hesitates and the cops look at each other and then the Burly Officer releases Rick from his head-lock. 
BURLY OFFICER All right, let him up. The young officers get off Fred and help him up. Fred rushes to the Doctor, who seems very serious. 
FRED Please tell me she's gonna be okay. 
DOCTOR She is. Your wife broke her nose and she got shaken up a bit, but all in all she's a very lucky woman. 
FRED You got that wrong, doc. I'm the lucky one. Fred is visibly relieved as the doctor smiles and walks off. 
FRED (CONT'D) 
(CALLING OUT) Bless you, doctor! Fred turns to Rick and the two men hug and then Rick grabs Fred by the shoulders and looks him in the eye. 
RICK You take care of that woman, buddy, and I'm gonna go home and take care of mine. Fred nods, emotional, as the cops look at each other, unmoved. Rick starts to walk away. 
FRED Rick... Rick stops and turns at the door. 
FRED (CONT'D) You go love that lady! The Burly Officer rolls his eyes and steps up to Rick. 
BURLY OFFICER Uh, before you 'go love that lady', we're going to have to write you guys up. As the officer pulls out his CITATION PAD, we

Rick pulls up in the wrecked mini-van and gets out. 
INT. BEACH COTTAGE - CONTINUOUS 
Rick steps quietly into the house. He sees two empty bottles of wine and two half-filled glasses on the coffee table. Then he hears Maggie's O.S. VOICE coming from the bedroom. 
MAGGIE (O.S.) Oh my god...oh my god...oh my and... ON RICK - he looks concerned as he approaches the bedroom door. 
INT. BEACH COTTAGE - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Rick ENTERS to find Maggie laying in bed... TALKING ON THE 
PHONE. 
MAGGIE 
(INTO PHONE) Oh my god... oh my god, you poor thing. Maggie looks up, shocked to see Rick. 
MAGGIE (CONT'D) 
(INTO PHONE) Hold on, Rick just walked in.

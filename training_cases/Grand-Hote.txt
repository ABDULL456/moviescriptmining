SHOOTING DRAFT 
PROLOGUE 
Berlin. 
Season is March. 
Action of the picture takes place in approximately 36 hours. 
Picture commences at approximately 12:35 in the day. 
Time: The Present. 
EXTERIOR REVOLVING DOOR 
Show general natural action of people going in and people coming out but in it is the definite inference of people arriving and people leaving the big hotel. 
MOVE INSIDE THROUGH THE REVOLVING DOOR -- very quickly. CAMERA PAUSES ON THE THRESHOLD like a human being, seeing and hearing. 
DISSOLVE OUT. 
DISSOLVE INTO: Clock. It is twenty minutes to one -- and then moves slowly into the crowd of busy mid-day business jumble. 
CAMERA pushes through crowd and passes by the foot of the steps that lead up to the restaurant. In its journey, it passes Kringelein looking up. He is not pointed. 
THE CAMERA then saunters -- getting a slow profile movement across -- near Senf's desk. Senf is very busy. THE CAMERA now passes -- profile -- the desk of Senf. General action. Senf stands before his background of slots and keys. WE PROCEED until we are facing the elevator. 
At that moment the elevator is opening. Among the people who emerge is Suzette, who moves too quickly for us to distinguish who she is. 
THE CAMERA PANS quickly with her and in the distance we hear her saying to Senf: 
SUZETTE Madam Grusinskaya will not want her car. 
This line is only just above the general clatter of action but it is picked-up sharply first by Senf then by Bell-Captain -- and as the CAMERA SLOWLY TURNS AROUND, we see the boy going towards the door and we hear the voice in the distance, saying: 
VOICE Cancel Madam Grusinskaya's car. 
The CAMERA now backs away from the scene into the BAR. (a section.) It backs to the back of the bar and proceeds -- in profile -- behind the backs of the barmen. A mixed crowd of people drinking before their lunch. 
We pick up the Doctor, leaning his head upon his hands, looking into space. The woman next to him, a noisy blonde, is laughing. The doctor glances up at her -- she glances at the doctor. She and the audience see the scarred side of his face -- the laugh dies on her lips and she turns suddenly to her companion, who is the Baron. We do not get much of a chance to see him because at that instant he is glancing at his watch, his shoulders are turning away from THE CAMERA and he moves out towards the lobby. 
BACK UP a few feet and LAP DISSOLVE as you move into the main aisle of busy room in restaurant. Great activity of waiters. The bustle and activity of fashionable lunchtime. A string orchestra is playing. 
Among other things, we pick up the smiling face of the pompous Maitre d'hotel, he has apparently just shown someone important to a table. 
THE CAMERA watches his face and follows him. His face just as CAMERA reaches service table. The pompous Maitre d'hotel now becomes a thing of drama as he demands of a waiter: 
MAITRE D'HOTEL Where is that gentleman's soup? 
The waiter, frightened and perspiring, doesn't bother to argue -- he tears off quickly (CAMERA FOLLOWING HIM) to another service table. The waiter seizes buss-boy's arm: 
WAITER Where's that soup? 
Boy goes off at great rate of speed, CAMERA FOLLOWS HIM, into service room of kitchen. Boy stops at soup chef's counter. He is not the only waiter wanting soup at that moment. He pushes his way to the front and puts his ticket forward. 
BOY Quick -- come on -- come on... 
The soup chef, used to impatient waiters, makes no exception of the young man. He looks at him as much as to say: "I'll slap you on the mouth." At the same time he is pulling over a cauldron of soup. 
CUT TO: 
CAULDRON OF SOUP being pulled over -- it dislodges a small cauldron that is near the edge. We see the soup fall and hear the scream of a woman before showing her agonized face -- She has been scalded. General steamy confusion. The chef has filled the plate. WE PROCEED the buss-boy out. Half way down the aisle, the waiter takes it from him. 
THE CAMERA follows the waiter who places the soup before Mr. Preysing. Preysing has been waiting, with his serviette carefully tucked in his collar. His spoon is in his hand. A horrible man, ready for action. The soup is in front of him, he tastes it, pushes it away, frowns, we feel he is going to tear the place down. 
WAITER (anxious voice) Yes. 
PREYSING (grimly) Cold. 
VOICE (near Preysing's elbow) Mr. Preysing... 
PREYSING (in same voice) Yes... 
BELLBOY Telephone -- from Fredersdorf -- 
Preysing rises, struts from restaurant. CAMERA FOLLOWS HIM -- He walks out through the door... 
DISSOLVE OUT AND INTO: 
Between two operators heads. Odd effect at board. CAMERA TILTS UP as Preysing's head looks right down at girl. 
Bellboy is with Preysing. 
BELLBOY Mr. Preysing from Fredersdorf -- his call. 
As the CAMERA IS BACKING OUT OF THE ROOM which is in reality the restaurant converted -- the tall figure of the Baron -- he proceeds through the door of the restaurant -- 
Note: Question here as to whether Yellow Room will be the restaurant converted, or not. In which case it will be necessary to add scene of Baron walking through corridor upstairs -- giving sense of distance. 
The Baron is whistling the tune of the orchestra, he proceeds through the lobby as if on a mission. He glances at a pretty woman who passes and nods good evening to the Doctor, who is seated in his chair, not far from the desk. He enters. 
CUT TO: 
FLORIST SHOP 
Pretty girl is there, she has seen him coming. She turns from the door and hands him a box of orchids, already tied in ribbon. 
BARON Good little girl -- nice ones? 
GIRL Yes, Baron. 
The Baron would stay and flirt but he has a mission; he leaves. 
CUT TO: 
LOBBY 
In the lobby we pick up the Baron leaving the florists with small box of flowers -- he crosses quickly to Senf's desk. 
SHOT OVER SENF'S HEAD as the Baron puts the flowers down. Senf is busy. 
The Baron is whistling gaily -- tapping his fingers on the flower box -- he is good-natured and patient. 
SENF (to Clerk -- as telephone bell rings) Is that for me? 
CLERK No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought. (he replaces the receiver) 
SENF (to one of the bellboys) Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought. 
Boy leaves. We hear his voice out of scene at the door. 
BELLBOY'S VOICE Madam Grusinskaya's car... to be brought. 
SENF Good evening, Baron. 
BARON (amiably) Good evening. Will you send these up to Madam Grusinskaya? 
SENF Yes, Baron. (he hands the box of flowers to the clerk) Madam Grusinskaya. 
Clerk hands box to bellboy. 
CLERK Room one-seventy -- Madam Grusinskaya. 
BARON (to Senf) Have you my tickets for the theatre? 
SENF Oh yes, Baron -- (to Clerk) Baron von Gaigern's seats for Madam Grusinskaya. 
Telephone rings again. Clerk picks it up. 
SENF (to Clerk) For me? 
CLERK (at telephone -- shakes his head) No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is not to be brought. 
SENF (to boy) Madam Grusinskaya's car is not to be brought. 
The Clerk hands Senf the tickets which Senf hands to the Baron. 
BARON Charge them... 
As the Baron is picking up his tickets he looks around quickly as he hears the voice of Pimenov, who has arrived apparently from his afternoon walk from the rehearsal at the theatre. 
PIMENOV (to Senf) Good evening -- my key -- one sixty- eight. 
BARON Good evening, Mr. Pimenov. 
PIMENOV Oh -- good evening, Baron. 
BARON How's the beautiful lady? 
PIMENOV Grusinskaya -- well, to tell the truth, Baron -- tonight we are a little bit nervous. Were you at the theatre last night? 
BARON Certainly -- always when Grusinskaya dances. 
PIMENOV Well -- last night was not so good. 
BARON I thought she was splendid! 
PIMENOV Yes -- but the audience. 
At that moment they are interrupted by a vehement little Japanese with his wife. They are arguing with the Clerk. The Japanese speaks in Japanese to his wife. 
CLERK (to Japanese) The parquot loges are behind the parquet chairs. 
JAPANESE Then they've put me back and I want to be up in front. How is that, chairs in front of loges? 
Senf is speaking to a lady at the same time. 
SENF The train leaves at seven-thirty, Madam. That is the only through train -- the dining car goes along. 
The Baron and Pimenov exchange glances as the little Japanese speaks volubly to his wife. 
BARON (sarcastically) It's always so quiet here. 
PIMENOV If you occupied the room next to Madam Grusinskaya, you would appreciate the quiet of a hotel lobby. 
KRINGELEIN I came here because I wanted to live here, two weeks, maybe three -- God only knows -- I've told you I'll pay -- I'll pay anything you ask. I'm tired -- I'm ill -- I can't wait. 
As he finishes the Doctor draws into the scene -- he is watching. 
Assistant Manager enters. 
ASSISTANT MANAGER Has the gentleman a complaint? 
Rohna and Kringelein speak together. 
ROHNA The gentleman is dissatisfied with room number five fifty-nine. 
KRINGELEIN I certainly have a complaint -- and a fair one. 
He senses an audience and warms up. The Baron and Pimenov enter the scene. The lady and gentleman have turned. The bellboy stands watching curiously and even Senf pauses and looks up. 
KRINGELEIN (continuing) I came here from a long distance to stay at the Grand Hotel. I want a room -- a big room -- like you would give General Director Preysing -- I'm as good as Mr. Preysing -- I can pay like Mr. Preysing -- would you give him a little room, way up in the corner with the hot water pipes going -- bang -- bang -- bang... (he bangs at the desk with his fist) 
DOCTOR This gentleman can have my room. 
KRINGELEIN (turning) Oh! 
DOCTOR Send his bags up to my room. 
KRINGELEIN Oh -- but -- I -- 
DOCTOR You're tired. I can see that. 
KRINGELEIN Yes -- yes -- I am tired. I have been ill... 
DOCTOR You are ill. 
During this scene the manager has been talking with Rohna quietly. The manager how turns. 
MANAGER Mr. Kringelein will take room number one-seventy-six, one of our most expensive rooms. It is large and on the front with bath. 
KRINGELEIN (subdued -- exhausted --) Does that mean that the bath is my own? --- Private? 
MANAGER Certainly, sir. 
KRINGELEIN Well, now, that's very kind -- thanks. That's what I want -- a large room on the front with a private bath -- Yes, that's what I want. I can pay now if you like. 
He takes out his wallet and nervously commences to extract money. 
DOCTOR That will not be necessary. 
The manager is instructing the bellboy to take Kringelein to the new room. 
Kringelein accidentally drops a bill -- the Baron, who has noticed the money, stoops to pick it up. 
In bending himself, Kringelein drops his hat. 
Baron picks up the hat and considerately brushes it with his sleeve. 
KRINGELEIN Thank you, sir. 
BARON (amused) Not at all, sir. (he beams) 
KRINGELEIN (finding a friendly face) Permit me -- my name is Kringelein -- from Fredersdorf. 
BARON I'm Baron von Gaigern. 
KRINGELEIN Oh, a Baron! (he is impressed) 
Baron catches the mood of making this gentleman suddenly popular. 
BARON And this is Doctor Otternschlag. 
KRINGELEIN (turning to Doctor) Oh -- Doctor -- you are a Doctor -- I am -- 
DOCTOR I know -- I know -- when a man's collar is an inch too big for him -- I know he is ill. 
KRINGELEIN Yes -- Oh -- oh -- yes, -- (his finger goes nervously to his collar) 
Zinnowitz passes through scene quickly on his way out. 
At that moment, Pimenov returns from the news-stand, where he has bought the evening papers. 
PIMENOV Well, Baron -- I must go and dress. 
KRINGELEIN (to doctor) Is this gentleman a Baron, too? 
PIMENOV (laughing) Unfortunately no. 
The Manager comes into scene. 
MANAGER Will Mr. Kringelein kindly register. 
KRINGELEIN Again? 
MANAGER Please. 
Kringelein turns to the desk. The Doctor turns up with him. 
At that moment the Baron's chauffeur touches his arm. 
CHAUFFEUR Have you a minute now? 
BARON No -- I told you not to come in this lobby. 
FLAEMMCHEN You're a fool! 
BARON Yes, I am rather. 
He glances down the passage again, his hands in his pockets. 
She glances impatiently at her watch. 
BARON He must be very nice. 
FLAEMMCHEN Who? 
BARON (gallantly) Whoever is keeping you waiting. 
FLAEMMCHEN (indicating Preysing's door) Have you seen it? 
BARON Oh, my large and noisy neighbor -- really? That? (indicating Preysing's door) 
FLAEMMCHEN That. 
BARON (with meaning) You? 
FLAEMMCHEN (quickly) Oh -- work!! 
BARON (with meaning) Oh! 
FLAEMMCHEN Dictation. (she twittles her fingers) You know... 
BARON Oh... poor child. If you were free, I'd ask you to come and have some tea -- but -- 
FLAEMMCHEN Tea would spoil my dinner. (lightly) One meal a day, I'd hate to spoil it. 
BARON Reducing? 
FLAEMMCHEN (she turns invitingly) No -- why? -- should I? 
BARON Lord no -- charming -- but why one meal a day? 
FLAEMMCHEN (laughing in his face) Money -- Ever heard of it? 
BARON Yes -- yes indeed -- but you are a... (moves fingers) ...a stenographer. Don't little stenographers earn little pennies? 
FLAEMMCHEN Very little. 
BARON Too bad. 
FLAEMMCHEN Did you ever see a stenographer with a decent frock on? -- One that she'd bought herself? 
BARON Poor child -- (enthusiastically) I wish I were free tonight -- we could -- 
FLAEMMCHEN (with invitation) Aren't you? 
BARON (quickly) What? 
FLAEMMCHEN Free -- 
BARON (glancing up passage) Unfortunately no -- to bad -- tomorrow though. 
FLAEMMCHEN Tomorrow? What time tomorrow? 
BARON Shall we say five o'clock -- downstairs? 
FLAEMMCHEN Where downstairs? 
BARON Yellow Room where they dance -- (business) 
FLAEMMCHEN You're very funny -- 
BARON (with great meaning) Yes? -- Tomorrow? 
FLAEMMCHEN Of course. 
BARON Really? 
Flaemmchen laughs at him. 
BARON We'll dance. 
FLAEMMCHEN (slowly) All right. We'll dance. 
At that moment we hear Kringelein's voice calling from his doorway at the end of the passage. 
KRINGELEIN'S VOICE Baron -- Oh, Baron! 
The Baron turns and looks off at --- 
KRINGELEIN 
Kringelein is in his door in the distance -- radiant. He waves. 
KRINGELEIN If I could trouble the Baron to come and see this beautiful room. I have ordered champagne. Perhaps the Baroness could join us. 
CUT BACK TO: 
FLAEMMCHEN, BARON AND KRINGELEIN 
KRINGELEIN Waiter, oh waiter! Wait a minute! (to Baron and Flaemmchen) We are having caviar -- it's expensive but that makes no difference -- I see the Baroness is laughing. 
FLAEMMCHEN Have caviar if you like, but it tastes like herring to me. 
Pimenov (at heart a clown) makes a grand comedy bow. He will deliberately try to tease Madam out of her mood. 
She glances at him, without smiling, crosses to the dressing- table and sits. 
PIMENOV It is time for the performance. 
GRUSINSKAYA (under her breath) The performance -- the performance -- the performance. (during this scene the orchids fall to the floor) 
It is a hysterical out-burst. It is not a woman who is just temperamental, it is something deeper than that. She is very near a nervous breakdown. We, the audience, must feel with her a revulsion against the word performance. 
PIMENOV (tenderly -- as he touches her shoulder gently) Poor little Lisevata -- she still has her stage frights -- it will pass. 
Pimenov kneels by Grusinskaya -- he is chafing her hands, he attempts to soothe her. 
Now Grusinskaya draws her hands suddenly away. 
GRUSINSKAYA It is not stage fright -- it's something more -- 
PIMENOV (tenderly) What -- what is it? Last night... 
GRUSINSKAYA Last night?... There was no applause. 
PIMENOV (quickly) There was -- there was. 
GRUSINSKAYA That theatre -- half empty -- dancing for those few -- I was frantic -- I finished -- the last beat and... (she reclines her head as the swan finishing the dance) ...I waited -- I listened -- but the applause didn't come -- nothing. A man in the box -- and just the claques behind -- it is passed, Pimenov. We are dead -- it's finished. 
There is a sudden knocking at the door. 
PIMENOV Meierheim -- 
The door opens suddenly. Meierheim bursts into the room. 
MEIERHEIM What is this that you have cancelled your car? Who am I that I should wait like a fool at the door? And here on a whim, you cancel your car. Have you forgotten there is a performance? Do you know the time? Or, are we all mad? Am I your manager?... Have we a contract? Have we obligations? Am I blind? (glances at his watch) ...Or is that the time? 
GRUSINSKAYA I'm cancelling the engagement. 
MEIERHEIM Oh! 
Business of Pimenov signaling to him. 
MEIERHEIM Oh! Madam is cancelling the engagement. Madam has chosen a funny time for such a funny joke. Ha, ha, ha -- hurry, come on. Tonight -- there's a line in front of the theatre since six o'clock. The house is jammed to the roof. 
GRUSINSKAYA The house is not full -- Is it really full? 
MEIERHEIM Packed to the ceiling. Hurry -- get dressed. And what an audience -- the French Ambassador -- American Millionaires -- Princess Ratzville -- er -- er -- 
GRUSINSKAYA (to Suzette) Oh -- but it can't be. 
SUZETTE Oh, come, Madam -- please come. (she holds up her frock) 
GRUSINSKAYA (changed mood) All right, Suzette -- quickly -- hurry. 
PIMENOV We will wait. 
MEIERHEIM You are late. Hurry. 
Meierheim goes over to telephone, he picks up receiver and says: 
MEIERHEIM Tell Madam Grusinskaya's chauffeur to bring the car. 
Show few feet of Grusinskaya getting dressed. 
CUT TO: 
BY ELEVATOR 
Pimenov and Meierheim. 
Meierheim is pushing the bell. 
PIMENOV How is the house? 
MEIERHEIM Terrible. After this, no more ballets for me. Jazz -- (snaps his fingers) Just jazz. 
PIMENOV If the house is empty again, I don't know -- 
MEIERHEIM When she gets her paint on and hears the music -- she'll be all right. I know these people. 
They are walking towards Kringelein's room. They are pacing rather like men who walk the deck on a liner. They turn almost together, but when they turn back past the CAMERA the CAMERA PROCEEDS on into Kringelein's room. The CAMERA ENTERS THE ROOM to a burst of laughter. Champagne bottles open, caviar, smoke, etc. 
In the room are the Doctor, Kringelein, the Baron, Flaemmchen, and a very fat waiter -- comedian. 
KRINGELEIN You may laugh. Caviar and champagne may mean nothing to you, but to me -- they mean a great deal. You see, I'm ill and all of a sudden I got a fear of missing life. I don't want to miss life -- do you understand? 
FLAEMMCHEN You are funny. You speak of life as if it were a train you wanted to catch. 
KRINGELEIN Yes -- and for me, it's going to leave at any minute. Let's drink. 
The Baron offers Flaemmchen a glass of champagne. She shakes her head. 
KRINGELEIN I'm sure this beautiful room must appeal to your taste -- distinctive, don't you think? Velvet upholstery -- 'A-number one'. I'm in the textile trade and I know. (he has a slight case of hiccups from the champagne. He touches the drapes) And these are real silk drapes. 
FLAEMMCHEN (amusedly) Silk -- think of that -- silk -- they are, too. 
KRINGELEIN (who hasn't stopped talking) Have you seen the bathroom? -- Hot and cold running water -- You see, I can get a bath whenever I like. 
At that moment Preysing's voice is heard calling to the Floor Clerk. 
PREYSING The stenographer! 
Music swells up from the Yellow Room. A great deal of noise, confusion and activity as the elevator stops to emit Grusinskaya, followed by Pimenov, Meierheim and some other people who are rather excited to be in the elevator with the great Grusinskaya. 
MEIERHEIM (off scene) The car for Madam Grusinskaya. 
The bellboy hears it and passes the word around. It seems to be echoed through the lobby. 
People turn, as Grusinskaya's spirit seems to rise with the attention she is getting. 
THE CAMERA precedes her through the revolving door, as she sweeps outside of the hotel. 
The Baron's chauffeur, Schweinke, is seen to watch her go. He looks furtively around and enters the hotel. 
CUT BACK TO: 
UPPER CORRIDOR - CLOSEUP OF BARON 
As he watches Suzette returning from Grusinskaya's room. She is about to push lift button - then decides to run downstairs. 
IMPORTANT CLOSEUP OF BARON 
FADE OUT: 
END OF SEQUENCE "#1" 
PREYSING'S ROOM 
Zinnowitz and Preysing are standing by door. 
PREYSING No news from Manchester yet -- Do you think we ought to postpone the conference? 
ZINNOWITZ Good heavens no. That'd create the very worst impression. You must be optimistic. You must convince them. You know as well as I do that the merger must go through. 
PREYSING Yes -- the merger must go through -- But I am used to making my deals on a solid basis. I am not a liar. I am an honest business man -- a good husband and father -- I have a sense of honor -- I have nothing to conceal. I couldn't live happily otherwise. 
ZINNOWITZ Well, don't get excited about it. We agreed that the merger with the Saxonia people must go through. 
PREYSING I want to dictate my statement for tomorrow. I can't speak without notes. I like to have things down before me in black and white. 
ZINNOWITZ I'll see you in the morning then, at the conference. Everything'll be all right, Preysing... Don't worry. Goodnight. 
PREYSING Good night. 
Zinnowitz leaves. 
SEQUENCE "#2" 
FADE IN ON BLACKNESS OF PREYSING'S ROOM 
We hear the distant voice of Preysing and the keys of the typewriter rattling. The reason for the blackness is that Preysing's back is flat into the camera. His hands are behind his back and his fat fingers are moving restlessly. It is an odd effect. We don't know quite what it is. 
PREYSING'S VOICE Both parties have fully agreed that this merger can result only in mutual advantages. 
Preysing moves forward showing that we are in Preysing's room. 
The change of light shows us plainly the time lapse. 
Flaemmchen is seated at a small table typing. Preying strides forward As he strides he says: 
PREYSING Moreover -- 
FLAEMMCHEN (repeating) Moreover -- 
Preysing paces the room. 
PREYSING (repeating) Moreover -- (he pauses, thinking. Picks up telephone quickly -- into telephone) Is there a telegram for me yet?... Oh -- when it does, send it up. 
During this, Flaemmchen, who is tired sits back and rubs her fingers that have been over-worked. She glances at her wrist- watch. 
Preysing comes and stands behind Flaemmchen. 
PREYSING Now, where was I? (he looks over the sheet in her typewriter -- accidentally his arm touches her neck) Oh -- sorry. (he puts his cigar in his mouth and walks away. As he walks away) Where was I? 
As he turns, he catches a down shot on her from behind as she stretches back showing her busts. Seeing his face looking down on her she pulls herself together and seats herself at attention. 
FLAEMMCHEN Moreover... 
PREYSING Moreover... 
It seems a silly kind of lull. 
PREYSING Do you work in Justice Zinnowitz' office? 
FLAEMMCHEN No -- only occasional jobs. (she yawns suddenly) 
PREYSING Tired? 
FLAEMMCHEN You pay me. 
PREYSING You're a very unusual stenographer -- 
FLAEMMCHEN Moreover... 
PREYSING Moreover... (as he paces the room, it is obvious that he is trying to collect his thoughts) 
She looks at him, waits a moment and then begins characteristically to, change the sheet of paper. 
FLAEMMCHEN I don't see why it's unusual for a stenographer to be pretty -- if she does her work well, -- seems so silly. I don't know why they don't like girls like me in offices. Personally, I hate offices -- I'd much rather be in the movies. 
PREYSING Movies? 
Preysing paces the room with the telegram. 
Flaemmchen rises, stretches. Quite naturally she glances at the pictures on Preysing's dressing-table. 
FLAEMMCHEN How nice -- your daughters? 
PREYSING My daughters -- yes, my daughters. (he is talking more to himself) 
FLAEMMCHEN Is that Mrs. Preysing. 
PREYSING (to himself) Definitely off. 
FLAEMMCHEN Oh -- too bad. Did you quarrel? (she is looking at picture of Mrs. Preysing) 
PREYSING (turns, speaks quickly -- definitely) That'll be all -- be here tomorrow at nine o'clock. (he turns, goes out onto balcony with telegram) 
Flaemmchen, delighted and with alacrity, crosses, piles up her papers and is prepared to leave. 
CUT TO: 
FLASH OF CORRIDOR 
Trim Flaemmchen out of Preysing's room. Take her down to elevator. 
At the same time, CAMERA PANS OVER and shows the Baron's chauffeur knocking at the Baron's door. 
BARON'S VOICE (calling) Come in! 
Trim the chauffeur into the Baron's room. 
BARON'S ROOM 
Baron is busy changing his clothes. Chauffeur steps in, he closes the door behind him and stands there with an inquisitive look. 
CHAUFFEUR You are late -- the dancer's gone to the theatre. 
BARON (very nonchalantly) Well? 
CHAUFFEUR She's gone to the theatre -- don't you know? 
BARON (very nonchalantly) Yes. 
CHAUFFEUR (ready to explode) And what are you going to do? 
BARON The pearls are in her room. 
CHAUFFEUR (threateningly) Now listen to me. The others are getting suspicious of you. I was on the telephone to Amsterdam today, they think you're scared. 
BARON I've been careful, I've been waiting my chance. 
CHAUFFEUR You've been waiting your chance. You're too much of a gentleman -- that's the trouble with you. 
BARON I told you I'll get the pearls tonight. 
CHAUFFEUR Need any help? 
BARON No. 
CHAUFFEUR Have you got that skeleton key? 
He takes the skeleton key out of his pocket and produces it to the Baron. 
BARON No -- 
CHAUFFEUR Why? 
BARON The floor clerk is out there in the corridor -- she sees everything --- 
CHAUFFEUR (contemptuously) I could take care of her. 
BARON How? 
CHAUFFEUR Chloroform on a handkerchief from behind -- while you... 
BARON No -- no -- no -- no... 
CHAUFFEUR Why? 
BARON Poor girl -- chloroform would give her a rotten headache... I know -- I had it in the war. Besides, she's very pretty -- not young but -- 
CHAUFFEUR You're no good for this business. It's just a joke to you... 
BARON (swings suddenly on him) I don't like your tone. 
CHAUFFEUR (comes up to him -- face to face) No -- 
Baron is suddenly seized with uncontrollable temper -- twists his wrists -- backs him to door, speaks quietly. 
BARON Get out and leave it to me... be ready to leave on the night train for Amsterdam... 
CHAUFFEUR With the pearls? 
BARON With the pearls -- 
The Chauffeur leaves. 
The moment he is gone -- Baron looks the door -- business ad lib. 
Crosses to window. 
SUZETTE Madame is ill -- her nerves... 
MEIERHEIM Her nerves... What about my nerves?... Who is she anyway? Where does she think she is -- Russia? Those days have passed. 
He turns and sees Grusinskaya standing at the door. She is in costume, very pale, very beautiful. Her coat, over one shoulder, is ragging, she lets it drop and moves slowly into the center of the room. Her hair, dressed for the dance, make-up is on her face -- she is breathless. 
SUZETTE Madame -- 
MEIERHEIM Well? 
GRUSINSKAYA I want to be alone. 
The other women in the room draw out, leaving Suzette to pick up the robe that has fallen to the floor. 
MEIERHEIM Where have you been? 
SUZETTE Should I -- Does madame wish... 
GRUSINSKAYA Suzette, please go, I want to be alone. 
Suzette obediently crosses to door and pauses on threshold, waiting for Meierheim. 
Meierheim approaches Grusinskaya. 
MEIERHEIM I suppose I can cancel the Vienna engagement. 
GRUSINSKAYA I wish to be alone. 
MEIERHEIM You'll be very much alone, my dear madame. This is the end. (he stamps out) 
Suzette, with a frightened look through the door, closes it on Meierheim's exit. 
DURING THIS SCENE, INTERCUT SHOTS OF BARON. 
It is some time before Grusinskaya moves. She crosses to door -- turns the key -- takes the key out of the lock and throws it away from her -- out upon the floor. She crosses slowly to the mirror, regards herself, silently. We hear the strains from Preysing's radio playing a light Viennese waltz. 
Grusinskaya begins suddenly to sob. 
FLASH OF BARON 
Watching her. 
GRUSINSKAYA 
Quite suddenly -- as if with resolution she begins to undress. Then she becomes weary again. 
With a garment in her hand, she moves slowly toward the curtain -- where the Baron is standing. 
BARON 
We see him tense himself. 
GRUSINSKAYA 
She drops the garment listlessly to the floor -- moves out of scene. 
CLOSEUP OF BARON 
He peeps around the curtains. 
CUT TO: 
GRUSINSKAYA 
She is in a thin robe. She sits before mirror -- looks steadily at her face. Her head goes down suddenly in her hands and we hear her say: 
GRUSINSKAYA The end -- over -- finished -- 
Suddenly she moves quickly across the room. Goes to bathroom. 
Baron half starts out toward door. He watches -- darts across the room as if towards the door. He hears her coming and darts quickly into the half open door of the closet. 
She re-enters -- carrying a glass of water. She crosses, places the glass down beside the bed -- her movements are quick and furtive -- then she crosses, picks up the telephone -- asks for the theatre. 
GRUSINSKAYA The Western Theatre -- 
She leaves receiver down -- crosses quickly to mirror -- stands there and brushes back her hair -- crosses back to telephone speaks: 
GRUSINSKAYA Western Theatre? 
She glances up at the clock. 
GRUSINSKAYA The stage -- Mr. Pimonov -- the ballet master... Grusinskaya -- hurry -- hurry. 
Again she puts the receiver down -- picking up a pencil she commences hastily to scribble a note. She writes frantically. Her other hand goes up and picks up the receiver. 
GRUSINSKAYA Yes -- yes, I'm waiting. 
She finishes the note -- commences suddenly to speak into the telephone -- 
GRUSINSKAYA Hello, Pimenov? -- I'm at the hotel. I couldn't go on -- I couldn't... No, no don't -- (long pause) ...Just alone... Good night, good night, my dear -- goodbye... Pimenov, how is it going, badly?... Uh?... Who's dancing?... Desprez?... Oh -- and how is it?... Oh, -- oh, I see -- they didn't miss me?... They didn't miss me. (she lets her hand drop with the receiver and goes on talking into the air) They didn't miss me -- good night, Pimenov... 
She is about to replace the receiver. She sits with it in her hand, unreplaced. 
The music has stopped. The room is strangely silent. Behind her the Baron peers from the closet. 
Her head sinks down upon her hands. 
A funny, singing noise comes from the telephone. She lifts the receiver to her ear. In a very strange voice, the voice of Opehlia, she speaks: 
BARON And...? 
GRUSINSKAYA He disappeared. Later he was found dead. 
BARON I never knew it was so dangerous to hide in a woman's room when she's alone. (he embraces her) 
GRUSINSKAYA Go away. Who are you --? 
BARON A man who could love -- that is all, who has forgotten everything else for you. 
GRUSINSKAYA You could love me. It is so long since I have heard that word. Nobody has loved me for a long time. It is so icy-cold to be famous. One is so cruelly alone. How is it that you -- Let me look at you. Your hands. Your eyes. Why could you love me? 
BARON I saw you just now -- then I saw you cry -- and now I see you in the mirror -- Grusinskaya... 
GRUSINSKAYA Grusinskaya... Oh -- oh if you knew how I slaved and slaved for Grusinskaya -- for the success of Grusinskaya -- for the triumph of Grusinskaya... and what is she now? Just someone who has found that on the day success ceases life ceases -- Are you listening to me -- Do you understand? -- I want you to understand. 
BARON Yes -- I do understand. 
GRUSINSKAYA I think you must go now -- the key is on the floor. 
BARON I'm not going -- You know I'm not going -- Let me stay here? 
GRUSINSKAYA I want to be alone. 
BARON That is not so -- you don't want to be alone. (he looks back at the bed as if remembering the suicide.) 
GRUSINSKAYA I want to be alone -- 
BARON No -- You don't want to be alone at all -- You were in despair before -- If I left you, you'd feel worse than you did before, You must not be alone -- You mustn't cry -- you must forget... Tell me that I can stay with you -- tell me. 
GRUSINSKAYA (whispering) Just for a minute then. 
Outside the distant noise of Kringelein is heard -- 
BARON What? Say it again -- I didn't hear. 
She whispers. 
GRUSINSKAYA You -- man... 
The way she says it, the word goes home. It hurts him. She has looked into his eyes for a moment with a strangely melting and almost happy expression. She gets up suddenly. 
(NOTE: The other side of the bed -- not where the glass is) 
She reaches with her feet for her slippers. She puts one on. She can't find the other. 
Business as he gets other slipper for her. 
He kisses her ankle and looks up at her. She smiles down. 
GRUSINSKAYA Thank you -- you are gallant. (she turns, her mood has changed) What a sentimental scene. Grusinskaya weeping is a sight worth seeing. It is many years since she did such a thing... You frightened me -- badly. You're responsible for this -- painful scene. 
He watches her. 
The sound of her own voice reassures her. She is generating warmth. Her cry has done her good, she speaks quickly, volubly. 
GRUSINSKAYA The stage frays one's nerves... the discipline -- it's so exacting. Discipline means doing what you don't want to do and take no pleasure in doing. Do you know what I mean? Have you ever experienced the weariness that comes from discipline? 
BARON I? -- Oh, no. I do only what I take pleasure in doing. 
Grusinskaya turns, she is graceful again. 
GRUSINSKAYA I see -- you do only what you take pleasure in doing. You take pleasure in coming into a woman's bedroom and you come. You take pleasure in a dangerous climb onto a balcony, so you do it... And what is your pleasure now? 
BARON (naive as he says frankly) I should like to smoke. 
She rises. She had expected something else. His reply strikes her as chivalrous and considerate. She crosses to the writing table brings back her little cigarette box which she holds out to him. He takes a cigarette and lights it. She watches him curiously. She smiles, as she watches him greedily inhale the smoke. She crosses and sits before her looking glass. She brushes her hair back and powders her face. She looks into the mirror, we feel that she has regained a desire to live. He crosses and looks at her in the mirror, he smiles. 
GRUSINSKAYA Why do you smile? 
BARON Because I can see something in the mirror that you cannot. My dear -- (he pauses suddenly) 
GRUSINSKAYA What can you see? 
BARON You are beautiful! 
GRUSINSKAYA No. 
BARON Beautiful but so sad. I did not know it was so dangerous to look into a woman's bedroom. 
Suddenly he stoops, takes her shoulder in his hands and kisses it. A long tender and sincere embrace. 
Her eyes close. A tremor passes through her. Suddenly his whole being is aware of her. She turns, rises and disengages herself. 
GRUSINSKAYA I think you had better go now. The key is on the floor. 
He glances back. He speaks suddenly with an air of command. 
BARON I'm not going... You know that I'm not going... Do you think I could leave you alone here? After that --? 
GRUSINSKAYA What? 
BARON The veronal -- you. I'm going to stay here with you. 
GRUSINSKAYA I want to be alone. 
BARON That is not the truth. (he catches her wrists) You do not want to be alone -- you're afraid of being alone -- I know you're afraid. I know you. You were desperate, just now, if I go away you'll be more desperate than ever. Say I am to stay with you... say it. (he almost shakes her) 
Her head falls slowly on his breast.

SEQUENCE "#3" 
FADE IN: 
TELEPHONE ROOM 
It is the first time we have seen it. There are about eight girls very busy. Morning confusion. (parts to be written) 
We pick up essential lines as we PAN DOWN SHOOTING AT THE GIRL'S FACES, assuming the CAMERA to be the board. 
GIRL ONE Grand Hotel -- good morning -- no, Baron von Gaigern's room does not answer... Yes,... all right... Baron von Gaigern's chauffeur calling. 
CAMERA PANS TO: 
GIRL THREE Good morning, nine-thirty Doctor Otternschlag... No, Doctor, no messages... No, Doctor. 
CAMERA PANS TO: 
GIRL FIVE Grand Hotel -- good morning... who is calling Madam Grusinskaya?... Oh, Mr. Pimenov. Madam Grusinskaya is not to be disturbed, sir... no, sir... yes, sir -- 
The word passes down repeated. 
VOICE Mr. Preysing's calls to one sixty two for today. 
CAMERA PANS TO: 
GIRL EIGHT -- good morning... Mr. Preysing -- (she plugs through) 
CUT TO: 
CONFERENCE ROOM 
Telephone bell ringing. 
General shot. 
Gerstenkorn, an old business man and Doctor Waitz, counsel for the Saxonia organization are sitting at a gree table, smoking and waiting. 
GERSTENKORN (glances at watch) Nine-thirty, Mr. Preysing keeps us waiting. 
SCHWEIMANN (who has returned) He likes to play the great man. 
WAITZ (glancing at market report from table) The Preysing stock is holding its own today on the market. 
SCHWEIMANN Ask Preysing what it's costing him to keep it up. 
GERSTENKORN And ask me what it's costing us to hammer it down. 
WAITZ Exactly. 
GERSTENKORN If the Preysing people get the Manchester contract, we shall certainly merge with the Preysing company -- but if they haven't they're ruined -- Preysing will have to declare himself. 
WAITZ Shhh -- here he is now. 
The door opens and Flaemmchen enters. She is agreeably surprised to see the room full of men. She likes men. 
FLAEMMCHEN (beams) Good morning, gentlemen -- Mr. Preysing will be here in a minute. 
Business of Schweimann and Flaemmchen. 
Gerstenkorn, making notes, glances at his watch again. 
Door opens suddenly. 
PREYSING (enters) Good morning, gentlemen. 
MEN Good morning. 
PREYSING Sorry I'm late, I've been waiting for Justice Zinnowitz, my legal advisor. 
WAITZ Oh -- ho -- you want legal aid against us? -- The whole thing seems to me to be very simple. 
GERSTENKORN Very simple -- I've always liked the way you dressed, Preysing -- English, isn't it? 
PREYSING (disturbed) What? 
GERSTENKORN (quickly) They turn out marvelous material in Manchester. 
PREYSING Manchester -- yes. Yes, yes, they do. Yes -- Now gentlemen shall we begin at the beginning? -- Have we cigars -- water and everything? 
Flaemmchen, who has been busy preparing her little table for work is seen in several CLOSEUPS: 
SCHWEIMANN (with a wink to Gerstenkorn) Manchester is a very interesting city, don't you think so, Preysing? 
PREYSING (stalling) Manchester -- yes -- yes. A man in the textile industry naturally has to know Manchester. 
GERSTENKORN There's a lot of business to be done with the Manchester Cotton Company. They've the whole English market right in their hands. Have you any connections with -- Manchester? 
PREYSING (quickly) We have a good many connections in England, naturally. 
GERSTENKORN I mean with the Manchester people? 
PREYSING (looking at Gerstenkorn impudently) We are here to discuss our merger. Naturally I can make no statement at this time. We must begin at the beginning. 
GERSTENKORN (winking at Schweimann) All right. 
PREYSING (far-away commencing to read his report) Since, on the eleventh of June, this year -- when the first negotiations for a merger between our respective firms was entered into -- both parties have fully agreed that this merger can result only in mutual advantages. 
BARON When I was a little boy I was taught to ride and be a gentleman -- at school, it was a monastery, I learned to pray and lie -- and --- 
GRUSINSKAYA And? 
BARON And then, in the war, to kill and hide. That's all. 
GRUSINSKAYA And what do you do -- now? 
BARON I'm a gambler -- I'm running at large like a happy pig, devouring anything of life that pleases me, I really belong in jail 
GRUSINSKAYA Oh! What a picture -- and what else? 
BARON (seriously) I'm also a criminal and a hotel thief. (he turns away) 
GRUSINSKAYA That's a silly joke. 
BARON (turns -- takes both her hands) Please look at me. You must believe me -- you must believe that I love you -- that I have never known what love is -- until last night. (he releases her hands and turns away again.) 
GRUSINSKAYA What is the matter? 
He does not answer. 
GRUSINSKAYA Flix! 
The Baron takes the pearls out of his pocket and lays them before her. 
BARON There. 
GRUSINSKAYA (with a little cry of pain) Oh -- (in the silence Grusinskaya puts her head in her hands and thinks) 
The Baron makes a gesture as if to stroke her hair and then holds back. 
GRUSINSKAYA (softly) Did you come here just -- just for that? Oh -- it's horrible. 
Pause. 
She is suddenly cold. 
GRUSINSKAYA You may keep the pearls -- I don't want them any more -- I'll make you a present of them. 
BARON (passionately) I don't want them now. 
GRUSINSKAYA (broken) I'll not denounce you. 
BARON I know. 
GRUSINSKAYA So -- 
BARON Yesterday I was a thief -- but now, -- 
GRUSINSKAYA But now, you must go... I give you the pearls. But now you must go --- 
BARON I wanted money desperately -- Can you understand? -- That's why I wanted the pearls. I was threatened -- I was desperately in need of a certain big sum of money. I've been following you -- I've admired you. But I have forced myself not to think about you -- Last night, at last, I managed to came into your room and -- and now. 
GRUSINSKAYA (softly) And now? 
BARON I couldn't go through with it. (his head goes down into her lap -- he sighs:) Remarkable. 
His hand touches her hair -- tenderly. 
BARON Do you understand? 
GRUSINSKAYA Yes -- yes -- yes. 
There is a sudden knock at the door. 
GRUSINSKAYA Quickly -- here. 
With a quick gesture Grusinskaya beckons the Baron to the bathroom. He disappears into the bathroom. She opens the door, after finding the key and radiantly addresses Suzette. 
GRUSINSKAYA Good morning, Suzette. 
SUZETTE (delighted to see her in a good mood) Good morning, Madam. 
She puts the coffee down on the table. 
Charming piece of business as Suzette, in putting the coffee down on the table must necessarily push back the heavily crested cigarette case of the Baron. 
SUZETTE Madam has slept well? 
GRUSINSKAYA (enthusiastically) Oh, yes, Suzette. 
SUZETTE Madam will dress now, it is late. 
GRUSINSKAYA Five minutes, Suzette, come back in five minutes. I'll ring. 
SUZETTE Yes, madam Suzette knows all about it. 
She is a French woman. She is pleased. 
SUZETTE Madam is beautiful this morning. 
As Grusinskaya hurries Suzette to the door she says: 
GRUSINSKAYA Yes, Suzette. 
Suzette goes out. Quickly Grusinskaya crosses and flings open the bathroom door. The Baron comes out. 
GRUSINSKAYA You must go now. 
GERSTENKORN What? 
PREYSING Oh no -- no -- the session is over. Let's go, it's off. Thank you, gentlemen. (he starts packing up his papers.) 
GERSTENKORN If you actually have news from Manchester then... 
PREYSING Gentlemen, I am now free to announce... (he is perspiring, his hands are trembling) ...that the deal between my firm and the Manchester Cotton Company has been successfully negotiated. 
GERSTENKORN Preysing, you're joking with us. 
SCHWEIMANN You're a deep one. 
QUICK CLOSEUP OF ZINNOWITZ 
GENERAL SHOT OF ROOM 
GERSTENKORN In that case give us the articles. We'll sign at once. We know all the details... 
PREYSING (smiling, slowly folds up the telegram and puts it back in his pocket) I thought we'd suspended negotiations, gentlemen. 
GERSTENKORN Under these circumstances it's quite a different matter. 
PREYSING Under these circumstances we might refuse to sign. 
By this time, Waitz and Zinnowitz have the articles out upon the table. 
Preysing is perspiring. 
Gerstenkorn puts his arms around Preysing's shoulders. 
GERSTENKORN Come on -- business is business -- Come on -- 
Preysing stands, looking ahead of him. 
Gerstenkorn picks up the papers glances at them, looks at Waitz. 
Flaemmchen is awakening. 
GERSTENKORN Here's my signature -- here Preysing, sign here. 
ZINNOWITZ What a session this has been. 
While Preysing is signing. 
SCHWEIMANN It's twenty-five to six. 
WAITZ We should celebrate this with a bottle of wine. 
GERSTENKORN (with his hat and coat) See you soon, Preysing. Next week we'll meet and discuss further details. 
PREYSING Next week. 
Hasty hand-shaking, business of exits. 
Waitz, Gerstenkorn and Schweimann out. 
Preysing has not moved. 
Zinnowitz takes the agreement and waves it in the air to dry the signature. 
PREYSING (to himself) Next week. 
ZINNOWITZ You let me talk till I'm hoarse and you had Manchester sewed-up all the time. Why? 
Preysing does not answer. 
Zinnowitz amiably shrugs his shoulders. 
ZINNOWITZ Well -- the deal has been put through. 
Preysing commences to laugh suddenly with increasing violence. 
PREYSING Yes, it has been put through -- it has been put through. 
During this scene, Flaemmchen has risen, piled up her papers, glanced at her watch. During this action Flaemmchen motions to Zinnowitz that she is going down to dance, etc., Preysing is unaware of this action. Flaemmchen leaves the room trying not to attract attention. 
ZINNOWITZ (to Preysing) What's the matter with you? 
PREYSING (hysterically) Bluff -- Bluff -- all bluff. 
ZINNOWITZ What's bluff? 
PREYSING (throwing the telegram on the table) That. 
ZINNOWITZ (reading at out loud) 'Deal with Manchester definitely off! "Preysing, oh -- I'd never have thought it of you. 
PREYSING No one would have thought it of me. I've been getting rusty in Fredersdorf. Well, if bluff is what the world wants I guess I can put up as big a bluff as anyone. From now on... (he turns away) 
ZINNOWITZ You must go to Manchester at once yourself and really see it through. 
PREYSING Yes -- I must go to England -- I was desperate -- Now I don't care -- This sort of thing goes to a man's head. 
ZINNOWITZ What you need is some relaxation. 
PREYSING Yes -- that's what I want -- I'd like to tear loose -- I'd like a drink. I'd like to go down to that dancing place. I'd like to start something. 
ZINNOWITZ I can understand that -- after your -- uh -- 
PREYSING Say it -- say it -- my lie -- it's the first time in thirty years that I've ever... Where's that stenographer? Miss Flaemm... 
FLAEMMCHEN What have you been doing all day? 
BARON Chasing around. 
FLAEMMCHEN Chasing what? 
BARON Money. 
They dance a few steps, in silence. 
FLAEMMCHEN You were very different yesterday. 
BARON Yesterday -- yes -- that was yesterday. 
They dance into the crowd. 
CUT BACK TO: 
BAR 
DOCTOR Well, Mr. Kringelein, are you getting what you're looking for? 
KRINGELEIN What, Doctor? 
DOCTOR A masculine paradise -- drink, the ladies, dancing... 
KRINGELEIN I had a very good opportunity, a young lady asked me to dance -- I ought to be able to dance, it seems to be very important. 
DOCTOR You must learn as quickly as your time allows -- Believe me Mr. Kringelein, a man who isn't with a woman is a dead man. 
KRINGELEIN Haven't you anyone -- Haven't you anybody -- you -- I mean -- Are you all alone in the world. 
DOCTOR (quietly) I'm always alone -- I have been everything. 
KRINGELEIN Everything? 
DOCTOR I was sent as a military surgeon to South Africa. Stinking climate. Taken prisoner. Home on parole not to fight. I was a surgeon in the Great War till the end. Grenade in the face. Carried diphtheria bacilli in the wound until 1920. Isolated two years. (pause) I've been everything. 
The music has stopped. 
CUT TO: 
BARON AND FLAEMMCHEN ON DANCE FLOOR 
FLAEMMCHEN That was lovely. 
BARON Will you do me a big favor? 
FLAEMMCHEN I'll do anything for you. 
BARON Would you like to make a man happy? 
FLAEMMCHEN (quietly) Yes -- I'd love to. 
BARON Then dance the next number with Kringelein. 
FLAEMMCHEN Why? 
BARON I feel sorry for him. 
FLAEMMCHEN You're not a bit like you were yesterday. 
BARON I fell in love last night -- the real thing. 
FLAEMMCHEN Oh -- there's no real thing -- it doesn't exist. 
BARON I thought that, too -- but I found that it does. Come along, dance with Kringelein. 
FLAEMMCHEN Anything for you. 
They move off. As they approach the bar, happily Preysing pushes into scene, touches Flaemmchen's arm. 
PREYSING Miss Flaemm. 
FLAEMMCHEN Hello! 
PREYSING I must speak with you, Miss Flaemm. 
FLAEMMCHEN (with the Baron) Presently, Mr. Preysing. 
PREYSING It's urgent. 
BARON Pardon me, the lady has urgent business here with me. 
PREYSING (to himself) Insolent -- Berlin manners. 
At that moment Kringelein has descended from the stool and crosses to Preysing. 
KRINGELEIN I wish you a very good evening, Mr. Preysing. You are staying here, too, Mr. Preysing? 
PREYSING I don't know you. 
KRINGELEIN Oh -- you must know me -- Kringelein at the plant. Assistant bookkeeper, building C, room twenty-three -- third floor. 
FLAEMMCHEN (quickly) Come and dance with me, Mr. Kringelein. 
PREYSING I must speak to you, Miss Flaemm -- business. 
FLAEMMCHEN (lightly) Tomorrow morning. 
He takes her hand, kisses it quietly. 
GRUSINSKAYA I'm worried about you. 
BARON Don't. 
GRUSINSKAYA On the train? 
BARON Yes -- I will be on the train. 
GRUSINSKAYA Till then. 
BARON Bless you -- 
During this scene Kringelein has been hovering nearby. As Grusinskaya turns away and exits, Kringelein approaches the Baron, who is standing perfectly still, looking off, -- his mind miles away. 
KRINGELEIN Was the Baron joking, or is it really true that the Baron is -- in financial straits. 
BARON (lightly) Absolutely true, Kringelein and I have to raise some money immediately. 
KRINGELEIN If the Baron -- if you would permit me -- 
The Baron looks at him suddenly. 
BARON What? 
KRINGELEIN I would be awfully glad to oblige, you've been so decent to me. Three hundred? 
BARON If I could get into a game I might win some. 
KRINGELEIN Gambling! I'd like that. I have over six thousand eight hundred marks with me. 
BARON If we could scare up some men to play. 
KRINGELEIN We could come to my room. 
BARON (with enthusiasm) Good! 
At that moment Flaemmchen passes. 
BARON Going? 
FLAEMMCHEN Yes -- 
Flaemmchen hesitates as though she wanted to say something that is on her mind. 
A curious little scene. 
She doesn't speak, she just turns suddenly through the door. The Baron glances after her a little puzzled, turns back to Kringelein. 
BARON Ready, Kringelein? 
KRINGELEIN Ready, Baron. 
They move off and are last in the crowd. 
FADE OUT: 
END OF SEQUENCE "#5" 
SEQUENCE "#6" 
No scenes 88-93 inclusive 
Sequence omitted from original script. 
DISSOLVE INTO: 
KRINGELEIN'S ROOM 
Possibly ten men are gathered about a green table. They are playing cards. There are champagne bottles, glasses, etc., on the table -- a great deal of smoke. Good atmosphere. The game is [...] fer. There is a dead silence except for the monotonous words of the players. 
White faced, the Baron has the bank. 
Otternschlag is seen to close the door quietly and approach the table. 
Kringelein's back is to us. 
They are smart people, not professional gamblers. 
There is a tension in the room. The men are gathered around tightly. We do not see the cards. 
The following voices are heard: 
BARON'S VOICE All right, gentlemen. 
VOICES I play -- I play -- Here -- Up -- Playing -- 
KRINGELEIN'S VOICE Yes -- me. 
Several men glance at Kringelein and the size of his stake. 
KRINGELEIN Is that too much, Baron? 
BARON (glances down at his own money) No -- not at all. 
KRINGELEIN All right then. 
BARON All right then. 
By this time the men are pausing by the door. 
KRINGELEIN I oughtn't to presume, but I -- (he is a little drunk) I'm so grateful to you -- it's been so marvelous. The first time in my life I have gambled -- I've danced! Oh, you can laugh, gentlemen, but it's the first time in my life I've ever tasted life! 
A MAN (slapping him on back) Splendid! 
There is a general feeling in the room that although this man is drunk he is terribly sincere, and that there is no wish to embarrass themselves or him. In fact, there is a nervous impatient movement among the men. But Kringelein has reached an emotional pitch. 
KRINGELEIN Life, gentlemen, is wonderful, but very dangerous. You must have courage for it, then it's wonderful. You gentlemen don't know that because you are all healthy and happy, but I -- believe me -- a man must know death and not until then does a man know anything about life. 
A MAN (sings) Rejoice in life while yet the small lamp burns. 
General noise among men, some are ribald, others are serious. Two men come and shake hands with Kringelein, bidding him goodnight. 
The Baron puts his hand restrainingly on Kringelein's shoulder. 
Kringelein almost staggers towards the sideboard. The men are nearing the door. 
A MAN (starts singing) It's a short life and a gay one... 
KRINGELEIN (seizing a glass of champagne) Every glass high to life -- the splendid, dangerous, mighty, brief -- brief life -- and the courage to live it. (turns to Baron) Baron, you know -- I've only lived since last night -- but that little while seems longer than all the time before -- all the -- (he collapses suddenly onto the floor) 
Business ad lib. 
The doctor is there quickly. The Baron next. 
MAN Drunk. 
ANOTHER MAN Poor fellow. 
General normal business ad lib between the men. Perhaps three of them help him up, including the Baron. They carry Kringelein to the bed. 
VOICES (of players mingling) Drunk? No, he's ill. Looks ill. (well paused over:) He's a doctor -- The doctor's here -- He's just drunk! 
DOCTOR Gentlemen, this man is ill -- very ill -- if you will leave. 
VOICES Certainly, Doctor. Goodnight! Goodnight, Baron! Bad luck! 
DRUNKEN MAN He's not used to champagne -- why does he drink it? 
Little comedy on exit. Ad lib. 
INTERCUT FOR RELIEF -- Kringelein's face -- white, drawn, tragic. 
One man, perhaps, remains. 
MAN Can I help, doctor? 
DOCTOR No, the Baron will stay. 
BARON Certainly. 
Man leaves. During this scene the Baron has been carefully making Kringelein comfortable on the bed, bolstering pillows behind his head. Kringelein's eyes are shut tightly, his hands are limp. 
By the business of the Baron, although we do not of course know it, this is the time that he takes the wallet from Kringelein and puts it in his own pocket. 
We might perhaps remember a sudden turn away in which we see his back and his right hand raised as though reaching in his inside pocket -- 
He stands looking down at Kringelein. 
DOCTOR (drops Kringelein's hand) It will be over in a minute. 
Kringelein's eyes flutter. His voice sounds hoarsely: 
KRINGELEIN Over -- over so soon -- it has just begun. (he closes his eyes suddenly) Oh, the pain. 
DOCTOR Try and sleep, Kringelein, don't be afraid. 
KRINGELEIN (mutteringly) I'd like to live a little longer but -- I'm not afraid to die -- I'm not... 
BARON (touching his shoulder gently) You'll be all right, Kringelein. (he moves from the bed -- takes out a cigarette, moves to the table. He seizes his drink) 
KRINGELEIN'S VOICE (out of scene) My pocketbook... my money in it... 
DOCTOR'S VOICE What do you say -- what? 
We watch Baron's face, he looks back over his shoulder. 
DOCTOR'S VOICE You what -- Oh, isn't it there? 
KRINGELEIN'S VOICE No -- But no I -- Baron, I've lost my pocketbook. 
Baron turns in this scene. He walks forward toward them. 
The Doctor's hands are on Kringelein's coat. 
DOCTOR There is no pocketbook here... On the floor probably. (He glances down) 
KRINGELEIN (starting up suddenly) More than fourteen thousand marks... were in that pocketbook. 
DOCTOR (looking at Baron) Fourteen thousand marks... One can travel -- one's happiness might depend on fourteen thousand marks -- don't you think so, Baron? 
BARON (with a shrug) Quite possibly. 
At that moment, Kringelein, who has been staring up at the ceiling, his hands clenching and reclenching, starts up. 
KRINGELEIN Oh, I've got to find it. 
DOCTOR Stay where you are. 
CAMERA FOLLOWS HER as she tiptoes to her room. She closes the door noiselessly and listens. She throws off her hat and takes off her coat. Opens her bag and takes out night dress, lingerie, etc. The lid of her bag falls suddenly. She starts at the noise. "Has it awakened him." She looks off. 
SHOT AT BATHROOM DOOR 
The thin stream of light is filled suddenly, the door of the adjoining room opens and back-lighted from the other room the huge form of Preysing appears. In this odd lighting he is a little more than Preysing. He comes forward. He speaks hoarsely, quietly. 
PREYSING Flaemmchen! (he seizes her to him) 
She goes to his arms passively. He rubs his face in her hair. She is passive -- cold. 
PREYSING (breathlessly) You are late. I've been waiting for you -- waiting. 
FLAEMMCHEN I had to arrange about the trip. 
PREYSING You're sweet. 
FLAEMMCHEN You think so? 
He holds her again, trying to kiss her. She deliberately avoids his kiss. 
PREYSING (awkwardly) Come here. (he sits heavily on the bed, sitting on her night dress.) 
FLAEMMCHEN Here, hold up! 
Preysing rises while she pulls her night dress from under him. 
He draws her to him. 
FLAEMMCHEN Oh -- careful, Mr. Preysing. 
PREYSING Call me -- do you know -- would you -- would you like to call me by my first name? 
FLAEMMCHEN (pulling away, glad of an excuse for conversation) Oh, no. 
PREYSING Why not? 
FLAEMMCHEN I couldn't do that, you're a stranger to me. 
PREYSING You're a funny little creature, Flaemmchen. I can't make you out. 
FLAEMMCHEN It's not funny at all. One can't get intimate just off hand. I could go to England with you and everything like that -- supposing I met you next year and I said: 'How do you do, Mr. Preysing! And you said: (she imitates him) 'That was the young lady who was my secretary in Manchester'. 
Preysing laughs. She laughs. 
FLAEMMCHEN That's all quite proper. (she is happy again. She would rather talk than be squeezed) But supposing I met you when you were with your wife and I called out: "Hello you big baby -- remember Manchester?' And you with your wife, how would you like that? 
There is a pause for a moment. 
PREYSING Please, Flaemmchen -- we'll leave my wife out of this. 
Flaemmchen yawns straight in his face. 
FLAEMMCHEN All right. I'll get undressed -- get out. 
He moves towards the windows which are open. She pushes his fat body out, almost playfully, through the doors and onto the balcony. 
Preysing stands out on the balcony. He looks down in the street below, then off. He starts suddenly because he sees a shadow over the railing of his own balcony. He is puzzled. Shadow crosses again. "Who can be in his room?" He moves forward and peeps through the window. One side of the French window is closed. From his angle we see the Baron furtively searching the room. He is now wearing an overcoat, the collar is turned up. Business ad lib. He finds Preysing's wallet. He stuffs this in his overcoat pocket. Preysing's face watching him. As Baron turns to exit, Preysing surges forward, pulling the window after him. The two men face each other. 
PREYSING Aha! -- The Baron. What do you want here? 
BARON I must have made a mistake. 
PREYSING Made a mistake -- remarkable. We shall soon see if you made a mistake. (the Baron starts to leave.) (bellowing) Stay here... Give me that money. 
The Baron hands him the pocketbook without a word. 
PREYSING So that's how we stand, Baron. 
BARON Look here, sir -- I'm completely at your mercy -- I'm desperate -- it's a matter of life or death -- I had to get some money -- tonight. 
PREYSING Indeed you must, Baron -- you must. Humm -- humm, but you must go to jail, Baron, you're a thief. 
BARON Be quiet. 
PREYSING I'm going to call the police. I'm going to watch you play the great Baron with the police. Aristocrat! Aristocrat! (he picks up the telephone) 
The Baron makes for the door on the other side of the room, pulls at the knob. 
PREYSING The door is locked, Baron. 
The Baron makes one dive across the room. Preysing grasps at his coat and tears it. With one hand holding the telephone, (the receiver dropping on its cord towards the ground) and one hand holding the Baron. 
PREYSING (into telephone) Hello! Hello! -- 
BARON Don't do that. (he tries to snatch the telephone from Preysing.) 
Preysing wrenches the telephone suddenly away from the Baron. The action excites him. 
PREYSING Strike me, would you? Attack me would you? Attack me -- 
With a terrific lunge, Preysing brings the telephone down upon the Baron's head. The Baron sways, stunned. (as in book). In his mad rage, Preysing, hits again with the telephone. 
PREYSING I'll strike you -- I'll strike you -- I'll strike you -- Strike me! 
By this time the Baron is a heap on the floor. We see Preysing come out of his blind trance. He even repeats again. 
PREYSING I strike you -- (with telephone foolishly in his hand, he looks down at what he has done.) 
CUT TO: 
PREYSING No -- no -- wait -- the man was a burglar -- he was going to steal my money. 
KRINGELEIN Oh, no -- no -- not the Baron. 
PREYSING (suddenly) Where is that girl -- she was working with him -- she enticed me into her room. 
KRINGELEIN Her room -- oh -- I see, Mr. Preysing -- I understand, Mr. General Director Preysing. 
PREYSING (frantically) I can answer for this, it was self- defense -- I can answer for this -- but that girl -- the scandal -- my wife -- my daughters, you know them? 
KRINGELEIN Yes, I know them -- 
PREYSING The scandal -- we are men -- you -- you could take that affair of the young lady upon yourself -- take her and hold your tongue. Then you can travel -- I'll give you anything -- anything -- she was with you. 
KRINGELEIN We must call the police, your excellency. 
Preysing takes him by the shoulders. 
PREYSING How much -- how much do you want -- you need money -- you have nothing. 
KRINGELEIN Don't worry about me, Mr. General Director Pryesing -- worry about yourself. (he picks up receiver) There has been a murder -- this is room one sixty-four. 
CUT TO: 
TELEPHONE ROOM 
Telephone girl plugs in. 
GIRL Hello -- hurry up... hurry up... someone in one sixty-four says there has been a murder. 
CUT TO: 
HALL PORTER 
The scene gradually grows intense. Porter calls night man. 
PORTER Here - quick - here -- go to one sixty-four immediately. (calls back on telephone) Give me Mr. Rohna -- Rohna the manager. 
CUT TO: 
ROHNA'S ROOM 
Darkened room. Bell ringing. Rohna sits up in bed, turns on light, picks up telephone; on his face we see him hear the news. 
ROHNA Where?... murder?... who?... all right, I'm coming. Wait a minute. (speaks in a monotone) Instruct everyone to use the utmost tact -- we must have no scandal in the Grand Hotel. Answer no questions, I'm coming now -- inform the police. 
(he replaces the telephone commences dressing quickly) 
CUT TO: 
GRUSINSKAYA'S ROOM 
Trunks standing around everywhere. Suzette is finishing packing. Grusinskaya is sitting in front of the mirror in a loose night wrap -- she is doing her hair. 
SUZETTE Madam should sleep. 
GRUSINSKAYA I've done my hair differently -- do you like that? 
SUZETTE When a lady falls in love she does her hair differently. 
GRUSINSKAYA (rising) In the middle of the night -- those flowers make me think of a funeral. Laurels and tube-roses. (she pushes the window closed, shivers, it is chilly. She crosses the room turning out one of the lights) Oh, think, Suzette -- the Villa and the sun at Tremezzo -- quiet -- simple -- happy -- we'll have a guest, Suzette. 
SUZETTE (quietly) Yes, Madam. And now Madam will sleep. It is not long 'till the train. 
GRUSINSKAYA Goodnight, Suzette. 
Suzette leaves -- turning out a light. 
Alone, Grusinskaya goes to the telephone. She raises the receiver. 
GRUSINSKAYA Hello -- can you tell me if Baron von Gaigern is in his room -- ring him. (talking to herself) Cherie, I must wake you or you'll miss the train. (into phone) ...yes... are you ringing, he may be asleep. (to herself) Cherie, you must get up and fetch me from my room -- I'm longing for you, Cherie -- I have not been to sleep -- I kept thinking you would come to me. (into phone) ...Oh, but he must answer. Ring -- ring -- ring. 
CUT IN HERE at discretion the: 
BARON'S EMPTY ROOM 
Telephone is ringing. 
CUT BACK TO: 
GRUSINSKAYA'S ROOM 
GRUSINSKAYA (to herself) Cherie, hurry -- hurry -- hurry. Answer the phone -- what is the matter. (into phone) Ring him -- ring him. (to herself) Where are you -- where are you, Cherie? Why don't you answer? (into phone) Well, ring him -- please -- please. 
FADE OUT SLOWLY: 
END OF SEQUENCE "#6" 
SEQUENCE "#7" 
Music up as we -- 
FADE IN ON: 
DISSOLVE INTO - EXTERIOR SERVICE ENTRANCE OF HOTEL 
The trees and the milk cart effect and other curious signs of dawn, which we remember after the climax of the first sequence. 
Music cold and eerie.

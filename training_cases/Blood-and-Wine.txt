BLOOD AND WINE 
Written by 
Nick Villiers 
SECOND DRAFT 
DECEMBER 12, 1994 
FADE IN: 
A PAIR OF HANDS men's hands, nicely groomed, hold a small white terry towel spoiled by blood-red spots. The hands rinse the towel in a copper bar sink. The stains soften but stay. A tan jacket sleeve, spotted the same way, moves INTO FRAM. The hands dab the wet towel at the spots, with no more success, and throw it into the sink. It falls half in, still dripping the stains a drop at a time to the floor. 
ALL IN CLOSEUP The owner of the hands walks to a wine rack, opens a bottle of white wine, drizzles the wine on the jacket sleeve. The stains disappear. He hangs his jacket on a hook and walks from 
THE CELLAR and up the narrow stairs. His FOOTFALLS ECHO against the unadorned cement block walls. We see his shape, mid- forties, powerful, his shirt pulled out. He's carrying the open bottle by the neck. 
2 INT. WINE STORE - NIGHT 
Still seen from behind, the man emerges from the cellar into a contrastingly elegant space with a wood-beamed. ceiling, vaguely European. He walks along a narrow aisle of wooden diamond bins. As the space widens his foot hits something in his path. He bends to find a shoe. He glances about nervously. There are shutters on the storefront windows. Shoe in hand, he tightens the shutters. We see his profile, a good-looking man. He walks toward a brighter room at the back of the store, the Tasting Room. Now he retrieves a pair of women's trousers from the floor, and as he straightens up we see his entire face, genial, venial, redeemed by his smile. ALEX GATES. He speaks nonchalantly toward the room. 
ALEX Twenty people tonight. I got a South Beach widow, a plastic surgeon -- they actually came together. 
(A BEAT) These people -- all they really want is something to brag about at dinner parties. He swigs from the bottle of white wine, grimaces, detours behind the counter, and spits the mouthful into the plastic lined wastebasket. He throws the bottle away. 
(CONTINUED) 
2 CONTINUED: There's a basket of baguettes on the counter. Alex breaks off an end and chews it to rid his mouth of the taste of the wine. Still chewing, he walks toward the tasting room. 
ALEX There I was, passing the wine, passing the bread, I suddenly felt like the priest at Masst Or maybe Mass started out as a wine tasting, and Jesus was a salesman. what do you think? He goes into 
THE TASTING ROOM It seems empty except for a large wooden table, folding chairs in disarray, open bottles clustered at one end of the table. A chalkboard on the wall has CHATEAU BEYCHEVELLE written across it at the top, vintages listed underneath. The woman's voice that replies is Gabriella's. 
GABRIELLA (0.S.) (with a throaty laugh) Maybe I should get dressed. Leaning against the corner is a woman wearing only her panties and a shirt. In her mid-twenties she has striking South American looks. GABRIELLA VASQUEZ. She's sipping red wine from a plastic glass. 
GABRIETM I don't want to spoil a religious experience. 
ALEX -- Ever heard of Georges Duboeuf? He throws away some of the glasses. 
ALEX Duboeuf has a nose and a palate -- like a gift from God. He can taste a single grape before the harvest... and describe the beaujolais it's going to produce. She laughs. 
GABRIELLA Oh, you have competition. 
(CONTINUED) 
2 CONTINUED: (2) 
ALEX 
(SLIGHTLY ANNOYED) You know how many bottles I have in this store? Open any one of 'em, I'll tell you the vintage and vintner, b lindfolded. He bends down to pick up the chunks of baguette strewn on the floor. He doesn't see her slip off her panties. She walks behind him, twirling them into a tight band. She whips them over his eyes. He laughs. 
GABRIELLA Okay. Show me. 
ALEX Victoria's Secret 95. She passes her glass under his nose. 
ALEX Gabriella, I picked these wines. 
GABRIELLA So what is it? 
ALEX All I can smell is your perfume. She laughs. 
GABRIELLA I'm not wearing any. 
ALEX I even bought it for you. She opens her shirt. She's not wearing a bra. She lowers her breast to the glass and then to his mouth. 
GABRIELLA Tell me now. He kisses her wet breast. 
ALEX 
(WITHOUT HESITATION) Beychevelle '83. Lot of body. Very aggressive. He pulls off the panty blindfold, kisses her on the mouth softly, then fully.

GABRIELLA

3 INT. WINE SHOP - NIGHT (LATER) 
ALEX It's late, Jason. 
JASON I'm going out tonight. Alex exhales. 
ALEX You can't'fish all night and work all day. 
JASON Working for you doesn't exactly tax my mind. 
ALEX No wonder you drop bottles. 
JASON Fire me. 
ALEX Do you do it on purpose? 
JASON Fishing bought me my bike. 
(CONTINUED) 
10 CONTINUED: 
ALEX I almost knocked it over trying to get out of the car. 
JASON 
(SARCASTIC) I wasn't sure you were coming home. 
SEVERS The TOASTER OVEN DINGS. Jason takes out a muffin, it in two with his fishing knife. 
ALEX Use a regular knife. 
JASON This has a better edge. Feel it (pointing it at Alex, 
BLADE FLAT) -- feel it. Their voices are rising. 
ALEX Pointed, it's a fucking weapon. Put it away. 
JASON Hell with you. Jason exits to the stairs. 
ALEX And keep your voice down. Your mother's asleep. 
STAIRS 
JASON If you got home on time once in a while, maybe she could skip the chemical help. Alex is also on the stairs. 
ALEX You have no idea, none, zip, what goes on in a marriage. 
JASON Yeah, well, I'm learning more than I want to. 
(CONTINUED)' 
10 CONTINUED: (2) 
LANDING UPSTAIRS 
SUZANNE (O .S=.. ) Now what are you arguing about? 
SUZANNE is a pretty young woman in her late thirties with a sense of humor and irony. She's chemically relaxed, but not stupefied. She pulls a robe around herself, modest in front of her son; and although her body's not spectacular, like Gabriella's, she has a trim. athletic build. 
JASON It's not an argument. 
ALEX I asked him to clean up downstairs. 
SUZANNE 
(SOOTHING ALEX) Maybe he hadn't finished- 
ALEX A modicum of cooperation, you know? 
JASON A modicum. What's that. Modicum my ass. He pushes past his mother toward his own room. Suzanne follows him down the hallway, leaving. Alex behind. 
SUZANNE I don't like that tone from: you. 
JASON Then go to bed. 
ALEX Hey! 
JASON 
(RIGHT BACK) What! 
SUZANNE It's too late for this. 
ALEX Jason has gone into his room. He slams the door. 
16 EXT. FISH MARKET - LONG SHOT - MORNING

Alex comes out of his office. 
ALEX Rob, has Jason shown up? A man's French-accented VOICE answers him from the store. 
ROBERT (O.S.) Not yet. 
ALEX You have his paycheck there? 
ROBERT All ready. 
(CONTINUED) 
18 CONTINUED: Alex takes it, and rips it up. 
19 INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - DAY 
The Chinese CHEF in the busy, steamy kitchen is inspecting the shark fins Jason has brought him. Jason is anxious to finish business and go. 
CHEF You no like my company? Fine. Who cares. Bring me more fin, you retire. You no want to retire? Good. Don't charge starving Chinese so much for these things. 
JASON You ever caught a shark? 
CHEF 
(BIGGER) You ever cook one? 
JASON Lemme -- lemme show you something. Jason pulls up the sleeve of his denim jacket to display a fresh gash across his arm. 
JASON He was already gaffed onto the side of the boat, good as dead. Two hours dead! And I was still too close to the mouth. Revenge is the last instinct to go, did you know that? The chef shrugs and shows his thumb, missing a joint. 
CHEF -- Work's a dangerous thing. (smiling with lots of 
TEETH) Nice fin, Jason. He tosses the fins in a cauldron of boiling water, slaps the CASH REGISTER on the side. It RINGS. 
20 EXT. RESTAURANT - DAY 
Jason jams on his helmet and starts his. motorcycle, guns it down the street.

ALEX Just get in the car. 
22 INT. CADILLAC - DAY (TRAVELING) 
Jason has fallen asleep while Alex drives. Alex picks up Jason's hand. Jerking awake, Jason tries to pull away, but his reflexes are sleep-slowed. Alex sniffs Jason's fingers, wrinkles his nose, lets Jason have his hand back. 
ALEX You stink. 
JASON I washed. 
ALEX There's Wash IN Dries in the glove compartment. Jason opens the compartment, finds the packets, opens one, rubs his hands. 
ALEX ... I'm trying here, Jason -- I really am. When you didn't want to go to college, I took your side, I said fine -- I mean, I -didn't finish college, and I've done all right. I gave you a job', a steady check, which is more than anybody else has done. And what do I get back? Shit. I've tried to teach you the business -- the care, the finesse... Jason laughs dismissively. 
(CONTINUED) 
22 CONTINUED: 
ALEX Well, look at it this way, Jason, someday you'll have your boat and I'll have my vineyard, and the best part '11 be they're nowhere near each other. 
Alex appears at the top of the stairs, surprising Jason. 
ALEX I was in the bathroom. He walks down the stairs. A wooden case of liquor is by the terrace doors, where he left it. 
ALEX Give me a hand, will you? I'm not as young as you are. 
(CONTINUED) 
33 CONTINUED: He goes out the door ahead of Jason, leaving him to carry the case. Jason hears a DOOR CLOSE upstairs as he lifts the case. He looks up.

RESUME SCENE His face tightens. He follows Alex. 
34 INT. RESTAURANT BACK ROOM - NIGHT 34 
A poker game is breaking up. Five players, Alex among them. He's done all right. DAVE -- an older man -- has lost. He tosses down his cards. 
DAVE I'm out, I'm home. 
ALEX 
(SYMPATHETICALLY) You play for the possibilities, Dave. So do I. Or else why get up in the morning. VICTOR SPANSKY neatly stacks his modest winnings. He's tall, thick-shouldered, 55, with a gray crew-cut, tinted glasses, and a smoker's cough. He does nothing in a hurry. 
VICTOR 
(TO DAVE) You didn't lose that much. 
ALEX There's an optimist in every game. 
DAVE 
(PISSED) Alex, I don't appreciate -- 
ALEX (overriding htm, 
UNRUFFLING HIM) No, I'm saying... the guy who sits down at the table with a loser's attitude... loses even if he wins -- which he won't. He's got no juice flowin'. 
(MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
34 CONTINUED: 
ALEX (CONT'D) He's got peepee in his veins! Life for that guy's a habit and stained pants. You know what I mean? Dave laughs, feeling better. 
DAVE 
NOT 
ALEX Try. 
DAVE Good night. They all AD-LIB "Good night," "See you next week," etc., as they file out. Alex and Victor are the last in the room. Alex puts on his jacket. 
VICTOR Paltry pickings tonight. Alex looks at the small amount of cash on the table. 
ALEX You want to cut for what's here. Victor chuckles.. 
VICTOR Sure. Why not. He pushes his cash forward into a pot with Alex's. Alex fans the deck across the table. 
ALEX 
(CONVERSATIONALLY) What-are you doing with your life, Victor?. Victor makes a small gesture, indicating the cards. 
VICTOR This, more or less. He pulls a card -- he has good hands -- and turns it up. A king of spades. A smile tugs at his mouth. 
VICTOR Beat that. Alex produces the Polaroid of Dina's necklace from his inside jacket pocket. 
(CONTINUED) 
34 CONTINUED: (2) He flicks it on the table next to Victor's king. Victor's gaze clicks from the photo to Alex, back to the photo. He slowly reaches out and picks it up. 
VICTOR Very pretty. I remember when it was the cover of the auction catalogue. The Duchess of Windsor's baubles. Bought for a young wife, I remember. Who I'm sure worked just as hard as the Duchess. 
ALEX it's appraised at a million three hundred thousand dollars. a laugh. Victor tosses the photo back on the table with 
VICTOR And they say there's no inflation. 
ALEX I have access. Victor shakes his head no. 
VICTOR I'm retired. 
ALEX And broke. 
38 INT. JASON'S ROOM 
Jason throws himself out of bed and turns on his STEREO, cranks the volume. He doesn't want to hear their VOICES.

(CONTINUED) 
39 CONTINUED: 
ALEX Did you never have a fight with his father? 
SUZANNE (hard, flat) No. 
ALEX -- A saint. I should've guessed. Must be at the right amid of God this very minute. Suzanne doesn't bother replying. She turns off the light, pulls the sheet to her shoulders. Alex sits down on the window seat to enjoy the champagne in the dark. 
40 INT. WINE SHOP, ALEX'S OFFICE - DAY 
Alex is on the phone. 
ALEX " -- the humidifier wasn't holding a steady percentage, there may be a problem with the regulator -- so I'd better check it right away.

41 INT. WINE SHOP - DAY 41 
Alex walks through. Jason's on a ladder stocking the shelves. 
ALEX You want to hand me down a good cognac? I'm going out to the Reeses.

CHOICE)' No, gimme the Pierre Ferrand. Jason starts down the ladder. 
JASON I'll deliver it for you.

ALEX He wants to talk. He dusts off the bottle. 
42 INT. VILLA - DAY - 42 
Alex follows Dina down a narrow service hall to the wine room. She talks without looking back at him. 
DINA -- enough of an investment in there -- 
ALEX -- not to want to take a chance, with a month away. That's what I thought. 
AT THE WINE ROOM 
DINA 
(NEUTRALLY) A month alone with Frank. Alex chuckles as he starts to inspect the humidifier. 
ALEX Second honeymoon. 
DINA The first one was bad enough. She's standing too close to him, but he has no room to maneuver away. He fiddles with the box. 
ALEX -- It may need a part replaced. 
DINA Nice suit. You always dress well, Alex. She brushes the lint off his jacket and leaves her hand there. 
ALEX 
(GENTLY) --,Dina... this is not a great idea. Used to getting her way, she's not easily dissuaded. 
(CONTINUED) 
42 CONTINUED:

MIKE They sailed out this morning. 
ALEX I know., but the nanny's supposed to be here -- Victor rolls his eyes, unseen. The nanny. 
MIKE -- The Venezuelan? They fired her. (with a snigger) Don't pay to be too good-looking in these jobs. Victor interrupts the gossip. He -sounds exactly like a repairman.

VICTOR Harold Freeman. Mike notes the name "Harold" stitched onto his coveralls. 
MIKE Okay. Stay here. I'll get the keys. He rides away on his cart. Victor sits down in the shade to wait. He stifles a cough.

JASON Then why've you-been crying? 
(DISTANTLY) Goddamn fiberglass -- His head drops through the hatch. 
VICTOR -- Either of, you know how to kill the water to the house?

GUARD Nobody's supposed to be in the house unaccompanied. 
ALEX Is that our fault?

CASH -- 
66 EXT. BOAT - DAY 
Jason is sprawled half across Gabriella on the deck of the- boat, a seat cushion under her head. He has his hand in her panties. She clutches his wrist and pulls his hand back into sight. He lifts his head to look at her. 
GABRIELLA 
(SOFTLY) I can't. He sits up, offended. 
JASON You waited long enough to tell me. Gabriella arranges her clothes. 
(CONTINUED) 
66 CONTINUED: 
GABRIELLA 
(FLARING) Because it felt good, and I'm an idiot! He fondly touches her face with the back of his hand. 
JASON No, you're not. She scrambles to her feet. 
GABRIELLA I want to go back now. Can we go back, please? 
JASON ... Sure. He stands up and moves to the helm, his legs stiff with injured dignity. Gabriella sits down on the bench, the cushion clutched in front of her. Jason sneaks a look back at her. With her hair wet and her makeup washed away, she looks younger than he does. She's resting her chin on the edge of the cushion. He switches on the engine and eases the boat forward over the anchor, engages the power winch. The CHAIN starts to 
CLANK. 
JASON I'm sorry. She turns her head toward him. 
GABRIELLA What? 
JASON

68 INT. GABRIELLA'S COUSIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
The dinner hour. The table in the mean little house is too crowded and too noisy; the television on the buffet can hardly be heard. Gabriella's Cousin and her Husband are arguing in Spanish, in a good-natured marital way, the Kids too busy teasing each other to notice. One Kid gets up to raise the volume on the TV set even louder. Gabriella carries her plate into the kitchen to escape the noise. The Husband makes a gesture to his Wife that says Gabriella's snooty.

Suzanne drags two suitcases clattering down the stairs. 
ALEX hasn't moved. Suzanne drops to her knees beside him and squeamishly lifts his wallet out of his pocket, snatches the cash, lets the wallet fall back beside him. Her breathing is so rapid and shallow it sounds like whimpers. 
79 EXT. CONDO - NIGHT 79 
Suzanne backs out the door pulling the suitcases, right into Jason. She cries out in fright. 
JASON -- Hey, hey.

80 INT. CONDO - NIGHT 80 
Ready to kill, Jason is shocked to see the job apparently already done for him. He bends over Alex to see if he's dead, and is equally sorry and relieved to find out he isn't.

The jewelry pouch spills out of Alex's pocket. Jason doesn't see it. The HORN BLARES, outside. Jason pulls his rod out of the closet. As he steps over Alex, he spots the pouch, the drawstring loose enough to let the necklace protrude. The HORN BLASTS again. Jason swoops up the pouch. 
83 EXT. CONDO.- NIGHT 83 
Jason runs for the car with his gear and climbs in. Suzanne peels away before the door is completely closed.

SUZANNE (CONT'D) (a laugh bubbles out of 
HER) Jesus, an ashtray. 
(LAUGHING HARDER) He-doesn't even smoke! On the verge of hysteria, she's laughing so hard, she can hardly drive. Tears run down her face, muddying the dried blood; she's a holy mess. 
JASON Pull over, pull over. He wrenches the wheel and steers the car to the curb. 
JASON I'm driving.

95 EXT. CAR - DAY 95 
As Jason and Suzanne reach the car, he sees the jeweler on the sidewalk now, outside the store, gesticulating to a sign painter. 
JASON 
MOM -- He wants to tell her he took the necklace. 
SUZANNE 
(BREEZILY) -- No, 1111 drive. The jeweler happens to glance in their direction. Jason ducks into the car, unnoticed. 
96 EXT. PIER - DAY 96 
Jason and Suzanne are sitting on a small, rickety pier, eating from the takeout boxes open on their laps. 
SUZANNE -- I feel... exhilarated. 
JASON Adrenalin does that. 
SUZANNE -- It ain't adrenalin, it's freedom. And she slips her wedding ring off her finger and hurls it overhand as far as she can. It drops into the sea. 
SUZANNE 
(EXULTANT) I don't want one goddamn thing of

SUZANNE You're quiet. She doesn't think he's going to answer her. 
(CONTINUED) 
97 CONTINUED: 
JASON I didn't even say goodbye. 
SUZANNE It'll work itself out. People manage. We're here. This is what you always wanted. 
JASON -- How much money do we have? Suzanne doesn't reply. 
98 EXT. MOTEL - LATE DAY 98 
At the reception window Suzanne is checking in with the MOTEL OWNER, a solidly-built, ruddy woman in her fifties who shouldn't wear sleeveless blouses. Suzanne has her wallet open. Her fingers hesitate at the credit card. 
OWNER There's a cash discount. Ten percent. 
SUZANNE 
(SMILING) Sounds like cash. She starts to count it out. 
99 EXT. MOTEL POOL - LATE DAY 99 
Ensconced at a table under an umbrella, Jason is writing on a paper towel. 
JASON (V.O.) Dear Gabriella. I don't know if you'll get this letter. I don't know if I'll send it. All I know is that for some reason I need to write it... 
SUZANNE AND THE OWNER cross the parking lot. 
SUZANNE 
(CALLING) Jase! He crumples the paper towel. She holds up the keys for him to see. 
(CONTINUED) 
99 CONTINUED: 99 
OWNER 
109 CONTINUED: 109 Victor picks up a chair and smacks it down. 
ALEX Hey! What's wrong? 
VICTOR This is not a water-view suite in Marbella! Did you notice? There's no fruit and champagne from the management. I don't see Swiss chocolate on the pillows. My masseuse is not at the door. And I am fucking dying, Alex! 
ALEX 
(SHOCKED) Jesus. Victor. 
VICTOR I don't intend to cough to death in a county clinic because you screwed up! 
ALEX 
(QUIETLY) That's not fair. The plan was for you to move the necklace. I wouldn't have had the goddamn thing. Come on... sit down... try to relax. He reaches for victor's cigarettes and crumples the package in his fist. Victor looks at his ruined smokes. 
VICTOR I'm not good at giving up things. 
110 â¢ INT. DOCKSIDE RESTAURANT - DAY 110 
Jason eats a sandwich at a'table, working on his letter. 
JASON (V.0.) I want to take you out with me when the wind's blowing whitecaps and the current's running against the wind, just to hear your hair slap against your skin. When will I see you? He glances up. 
(CONTINUED) 
110 CONTINUED: 
SUZANNE her hair a better, brighter color under her chef's hat, is cooking on the grill behind the counter, kidding the customers, enjoying herself. The greasy-aproned OWNER pats her rump as he goes by, not for the first time. 
SUZANNE Long arms, short dick, they always say. One of the Fishermen guffaws. The owner looks pissed. So does Jason who witnessed it all. 
OWNER (aside; to Suzanne) Can I see you in the office after lunch, please? 
SUZANNE 
(NOT INTIMIDATED) About what? 
111 INT. MOTEL - DAY 111 
Suzanne luxuriates in a. bubble bath, a glass of wine in her hand, the bottle next to the tub. She's talking to Jason through the closed door. 
SUZANNE I was not-fired, you jerk. I quit. 
112 INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 112 
Jason is prying a diamond out of the necklace with his fishing knife. 
SUZANNE (O.S.) (with a laugh) For about a minute it was very satisfying. 
JASON (concentrating on the 
WORK) You did the right thing. 
113 EXT. SECOND JEWELRY STORE - DAY 113 
Jason has put on his suit, changed his looks. He sizes up the store. 
114 INT. STORE - DAY 114 
Jason scans the case as he approaches the JEWELER. 
JEWELER. Help you? 
JASON Do you buy estate diamonds? 
JEWELER Sure. Jason takes out a zip-lock bag and lays it on the counter, one of the diamonds inside. The jeweler takes it out with respect and holds it under his loupe. If Jason's nervous, it doesn't show. 
JASON It belonged to my mother. The jeweler's heard every version. He doesn't care. 
JEWELER - .Price is the same. I can give you eighty-five hundred. 
115 EXT. BEACH - DAY 115 
The classified section already folded and marked beside her, Suzanne has propped herself on her elbows. She's looking out to sea. Talking heads bob like buoys, the waders. She notices, some distance away, a man in a suit walking along the beach. The image amuses her. He's moving in her direction. She finally recognizes Jason and raises her hand. 
SUZANNE 
(CALLING OUT) Hey, sailor... She puts on her hat to cut the glare. From under the brim she admires his approach. 
SUZANNE (as he reaches her) ... Look at you. What's the occasion? Jason squats down beside her and balls up the classifieds. 
JASON You don't need another grab-ass job. I been out talking to peoplel 
ALEX 
(PLEASED) They can't be too far. Victor stares at him. 
VICTOR I never understand your optimism. 
ALEX Or he wouldn't have lied. 
HENRY (O.S.) Hey, mister! 
ALEX 
(TO VICTOR) I think you made a friend. Victor turns around, Alex keeps walking. 
HENRY is in the doorway to the bar. 
HENRY What's it to you if I see the kid? Victor smiles. 
118 EXT. DRYDOCK - LONG SHOT - DAY 118

119 ' INT. DRYDOCK - LONG SHOT - DAY 119 
The Salesman walks Jason past the vertical rows of boats, stacked from ceiling to floor, extolling the virtues of his stock. Jason inspects a modest boat, takes out cash. 
120 EXT. GULF - BOAT - DAY 120 
Jason is helming a classic wooden fishing boat, THE HERCULES II, old and not too big, but with good lines. He's purely happy. 
121 EXT. WATER - DAY 
Jason steers toward the beach and drops anchor. There's a cabin among the palmettos. No car. 
122 INT. CABIN - DAY 
Jason comes into the cabin. 
JASON (just to be sure) Mom? The cabin is silent. He uses his fishing knife to pop loose a section of the cheap wall paneling. Behind it, a square of sheet rock has been sliced away between the studs to accommodate the pouch. He drops the pouch in his tackle box. A CAR is heard pulling up. Jason frantically starts to jam the paneling back in place. It won't hold. 
123 EXT. CABIN - DAY 
Suzanne takes a flat of geraniums out of the trunk and sets them on the porch. She opens the door. 
124 INT. CABIN - DAY 
Just as Suzanne steps through the screen door, Jason sees that his tackle box is open, the velvet pouch in plain sight. He kicks the top closed, bends to lock it. 
SUZANNE 
(CASUALLY) They'll think you stole it. He looks up at her, caught. She's walking toward the kitchen sink to wash the nursery dirt off her hands. She looks out the window at the boat again. 
SUZANNE Nice boat. (over her shoulder) Are you allowed just to run around with it? 'His tension ebbs. He picks up his tackle box. 
JASON I forgot my tackle box. 
SUZANNE -- Don't take advantage, Jason. They trusted you with the job. 
(CONTINUED) 
124 CONTINUED: He kisses her quickly. 
JASON It's not a problem. He escapes out the door.

127 INT. MOTEL - NIGHT 
Exhausted, Alex stretches out on the bed to talk to her. 
ALEX Napa's farther north. Victor comes out of the bathroom. He's waiting for news. 
128 INT. CONDO - NIGHT 128 
ALEX How about for me? Victor takes out the photo of Alex with the necklace and holds it up for him. 
VICTOR Nobody's seen this yet. 
ALEX You're sick. I'll do it. Alex throws open the door and barrels out of the car. 
135 INT. JEWELRY STORE - DAY 
The jeweler who bought the diamond from Jason lays it on a velvet pad for Alex, who's posing as the insurance investigator. 
(CONTINUED) 
135 CONTINUED: 
JEWELER (with a shrug) Said it was his mother's. 
ALEX A seventeen-year-old kid waltzes in with a diamond as big as your toenail, and you don't wonder?? You shouldn't have touched iti You know that! All right, okay. When we recover the rest of the necklace, I'll be back. Do not, do not sell it. I'll see what I can do for you, Raines. 
JEWELER i appreciate that. 
136 INT. BAR - DAY 
Victor and Alex are having a beer near the wide-screen TV. A game is on. 
ALEX Smart lady. She lets Jason make the sale. They get caught, he's underage, and she don't know a thing. I gotta give her credit. 
VICTOR You have interesting taste in women. Alex's gaze wanders to the game, but he can't get interested. 
137 EXT. VICTOR'S CAR - DAY 
It barrels up the highway, passing the same landmarks Suzanne and Jason did. 
138 INT. CAR - DAY (TRAVELING)

139 EXT. DOCKS - LATE DAY 
A storm is blowing in, and Jason walks quickly along the docks to his boat and swings aboard. 
140 EXT. BOAT - LATE DAY 
The waves have already started to slap against the sides of the boat. Jason tosses over his fenders and secures them to protect the boat from the pilings. He starts toward the cabin. The lock has been popped. The door is slightly ajar. He hears a NOISE inside. He draws his knife. 
141 INT. CABIN - LATE DAY 
Jason throws open the door. A figure is bent over in the galley. It turns, and by the light of the refrigerator Jason recognizes Henry. 
JASON Jesus, Henry... What the hell you doing?... How'd you know this was my boat?? 
HENRY I saw you cast off. Good little sport boat you got, too. Oh, whoa -- hear that? 
JASON 
(PARANOID) Where -- what?? Henry rubs his stomach. 
HENRY Right here, man. I ain't been eating my share since my fishing partner ran off. Without so much as goodbye/good luck. Jason blows out a breath. 
JASON It's complicated. 
HENRY 
(NODDING) Always is. The boat is rockirg now. The WIND has picked up. They hear the CLANKING and RUBBING of the other boats. Jason starts checking all the hasps and latches while Henry eats the sandwich he made. 
JASON So why are you on the Gulf? 
(CONTINUED) 
141 CONTINUED: 
HENRY My baby finally sank on me. Right at the dock. I thought I'd work charter for awhile. (moving to help Jason with the latches) -- Need a crew? 
JASON I don't know. Maybe. 
HENRY That's not why I came looking for you. Jason is checking the engine. Out of Henry's sight, he surreptitiously reaches inside a hidden compartment. 
HIS HAND wraps around the concealed pouch and withdraws, reassured. 
JASON secures the engine hatch. 
HENRY A guy offered me fifty bucks to tell him where you were. Sick old motherfucker. Big as God. Tried to say he was your stepfather. 
JASON 
(CONTINUED) 
163 CONTINUED: 
ALEX (dodging the question) I flew straight back from Napa when I heard. You hit your head pretty hard. Jason struggles to sit up, his equilibrium not fully restored. 
JASON Where's Mom? -- How's Mom? Alex sits down on the bed with him to break the news. 
ALEX 
(QUIETLY) I'm sorry, Jason... I'm so sorry. Jason stares at him. He hasn't absorbed the fact. 
ALEX She didn't make it as far as the hospital. Horror and rage flood Jason's face. 
JASON 
N000! He seizes the empty I.V. stand and hurls it at Alex, who throws up his arm protectively. Jason tackles Alex under his guard, smashing him into the metal dresser. Alex's head snaps backward, cracking the mirror. 
JASON -- You killed her, you fuckl Alex tries to hold him, eventually in a forced bear-hug. 
ALEX -- Don't, don't -- 
(CALLING OUT) I need someone in here! 
JASON 
(WEAKLY) Let go of me! Alex holds him close. He collapses in Alex's arms. An ORDERLY hurries in, followed by a Nurse.

(CALLING OUT) It'd be nice to have some help. C) Victor unscrews the trap under the kitchen sink. D) Et cetera. 
168 EXT. CABIN - DAY 168 
Alex is sitting on the stairs, staring out at the Gulf. He gives no indication of having heard Victor. 
169 INT. CABIN - DAY 169 
Victor lays his cheek along the living room wall to eyeball it for irregularity. A smile hoists his cheeks. He pops the paneling loose. His smile collapses. The niche carved between the'studs is empty. He rests his head against the wall. 
170 INT. HOSPITAL - DAY 
Alex walks down the corridor to Jason's room. He taps on the door. There's no answer. He pushes open the door. The room is empty, the bed stripped. Alex barrels out of the room to confront the tired young DOCTOR he sees walking down the hall. 
ALEX Where's my son?? 
DOCTOR 
(PUZZLED) I released him this morning. 
ALEX You let an underage boy with a head injury walk out of here by himself?? 
DOCTOR It was only a concussion. He's fine. He said you were in the lobby. Nothing to be gained, Alex whirls around and strides away. 
171 EXT. ROAD - DAY 
Jason is running down the road, his face contorted. 
172 EXT. BEACH - DAY 
Jason keeps running onto the sand. He kicks off his shoes and plunges into the water and swims. Swims until he's exhausted and gasping. He tips his head back in the water and screams his grief to the pitiless sky. 
173 EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
(CONTINUED) 
176 CONTINUED: (3) 
JASON Let's finish what we started. Slowly, he kisses her. She lets her mouth respond: a sweet kiss, in spite of the circumstances. His fingers scissor her nipple. 
JASON Just don't tell me that you love me. He peels off his T-shirt. 
GABRIELLA (in a whisper) I love you. He gives her a hard look. She holds his gaze and pushes his jeans down until he finally kicks them off and they're both naked. They begin to make love. 
GABRIELLA Wait. Jason doesn't understand. She gently pushes him back. 
GABRIELLA This way. She turns on her stomach and guides him back into her. Jason moves now rapidly. 
GABRIELLA Slowly. Her hand on his ass guides the pace. She hasn't had a young man in a long time. 
GABRIELLA 
(IN SPANISH) What are you doing to me? 
(IN ENGLISH) Don't come, not yet. They move as one, their passion enveloping them. He makes her come first. Then, when her boay flattens, he also comes and he's lying on top of her, his face alongside hers, their breath gentling. Finally, they lie side.by side. 
GABRIELLA Will you get me a towel? With warm water. 
(CONTINUED) 
176 CONTINUED: (4) He kisses her and gets up. If she didn't love him before, she does now. 
177 INT. THE BATHROOM 
While he runs the water to'warm it, he looks at himself naked in the mirror. His face crumples. He no longer knows what he's doing. 
178 INT. MASTER BEDROOM 
He brings the towel back to Gabriella, who wipes herself. Her mood, too, has sobered. 
GABRIELLA (after a moment) Are you going to kill me, too? 
JASON 
(REPELLED) No! 
GABRIELLA You'll have to. I'll know. I'll be a witness. I'll know you planned it. 
JASON -- Would you do that? 
GABRIELLA 
(SOFTLY) I like-you too much to let you kill him. Jasonstarts to put on his clothes: 
GABRIELLA I need him, Jason. 
JASON 
(FURIOUS) You don't -- you don't! 
GABRIELLA I'm not going back to Caracas! You don't know how we live there. She pulls the pillow in front of her to hide her nakedness. He touches her shoulder; she shrugs him away. 
(CONTINUED) 
178 CONTINUED: 
GABRIELLA 
(GROWING FRANTIC) You have to leave now, Jason. 
JASON What are you talking about? This is my home. I'm home. She stares at him. His face is set. She can't persuade him. Jason thinks of his next step, a plan. 
GABRIELLA 
(COLDLY) This is not your room, though, is it. Jason starts toward the door. 
JASON You're never going to marry him, Gabriella. 
GABRIELLA Watch me. He closes the door with a solid CLICK. She starts to cry, and still crying, she pulls the sheets off the bed, she has to change the sheets. 
179 INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Jason leans against the wall, his eyes squeezed shut, listening to her CRY. 
180 EXT. CONDO - DAY 
Alex carries his suitcase toward the condo. 
(CONVERSATIONALLY) where'd Jason go? 
184 INT. CONDO WEIGHT ROOM - DAY 
Jason is working out alone in the little gym when in the mirror he sees Alex come through the door. He keeps lifting. Alex sits down on the bench beside him. Jason ignores him. 
ALEX You have something that belongs to .me, Jason -- and I want it back. 
JASON It's not yours. 
ALEX 
(HARDER) Either way. Jason continues to lift. Finally: 
JASON Did you know the thing's worth over a million dollars? What a fucking stupid way to spend money. 
ALEX I was holding it for someone. These are dangerous people. 
(CONTINUED) 
184 CONTINUED: The bar wobbles with Jason's laugh.. Alex moves behind and spots him, unnecessarily. 
ALEX Don't screw around with me, Jason. He's in a position to crush Jason's windpipe. Jason shoves the barbell up in his face, finishing the set and re-racking. He reaches for his towel and wipes his face, his expression hidden. 
JASON I don't know where it is anymore. You killed the only person who did. 
ALEX It was an accident! What did I have to do with it? Jason wads up his towel and throws it at Alex. 
JASON There was a car following us! 
ALEX Did you see who was in it? Jason shakes his head no. 
ALEX I met one of these guys. Tall, weird-looking fucker with.a gray crew-cut. (letting out a breath) These people you don't steal from. Whoever was following Suzanne is going to come after you, too. Haven't you figured that out? For the first time Jason wavers.; it's a plausible alternative, but one that makes him guilty instead. 
JASON Who are they? Alex fastidiously drops the towel in the hamper. 
ALEX Doesn't matter. Give the necklace back to me, and we'll split the handling commission. His ingratiating smile offends Jason. He doesn't trust Alex. He shakes his head. 
(CONTINUED) 
184 CONTINUED: (2) 
JASON She never told me where she kept it. Alex doesn't believe him either. His hand. rests on a dumbbell, and for a murderous instant he's about to pick it up and use it on Jason. He lifts his hand away. 
185 INT. VICTOR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Victor is lying on his bed, the respirator beside him, while he talks on the phone to Alex. He looks dreadful. 
VICTOR Nice boy like that, the money means diddlyshit. And, personally, I suspect he'd rather die than tell you. So get a blowtorch, and use it on the girl until he cooperates. 
186 INT. ALEX'S.DEN - NIGHT 
Alex sits hunched over the desk, the phone in his hand, thinking. 
VICTOR (V.0.) .. Just as an example, Alex.

VICTOR (V.0.) When he does, I'll be there. 
ALEX Okay. He hangs up and rocks back in his chair. 
187 INT. VICTOR'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 187 
Victor attaches his mask, breathes in oxygen. He turns off the light. His breathing deepens. 
188 INT. ALEX'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 188 
Gabriella has already gone to bed. The lights are off. Alex slides into bed beside her with a soft groan. He reaches for her comfort. 
(CONTINUED) 
188 CONTINUED: 
ALEX (muffled against her 
SKIN) I'm never leaving you again. He starts to caress her. 
GABRIELLA -- I'm already asleep, honey. 
ALEX 
(LIGHTLY) Wake up. She realizes he isn't going away. She rolls onto her back. Her arms go around him.- Alex kisses her, long and deep. 
WAITRESS Refill, hon? He doesn't even hear her.

197 INT. MARKETPLACE - DAY (LATER) 197 
Gabriella walks through the stalls, looking for Jason and spies him at the counter. The paper is folded beside him. She sits down next to him. 
GABRIELLA Okay. Here I am. What is it? Do you know how much a cab costs? 
JASON I saw a guy following me... I thought you weren't safe. I was going to tell you to go stay at your 
COUSIN'S -- She starts to swivel off the stool to leave. He grabs her hand. 
JASON 
(HARDER) -- Hey! 
GABRIELLA I'm so sick of this. You'd say anything! He hands her the newspaper. 
GABRIELLA 
WHAT -- 
JASON Read it. 
198 INSERT: THE HEADLINE 198 at the bottom of the page reads, "Duchess of Windsor Jewels/Stolen From Socialite," with a picture of the Duchess herself in her glory days, necklace around her throat. 
GABRIELLA reads the headline and starts to laugh. 
GABRIELLA There is such a thing as justicel Dina's necklace. Couldn't happen to a better person. 
JASON Alex stole it. 
(CONTINUED) 
198 CONTINUED: 
GABRIELLA You really hate him. 
JASON The reason I know is because I stole it from him. Her eyes widen. 
VICTOR his face concealed among the candles is trying to figure out what drama is going on between Jason and Gabriella. He can read their faces, but not their lips. 
JASON AND GABRIELLA 
GABRIELLA ... The sonofabitch. That's why he went out with me. He was trying to use me! (the thought hits her) They'll think I'm part of it! The maid who got fired?? 
JASON You weren't a maid. 
GABRIELLA What difference does it make?? 
JASON We're going to the Gulf. He throws money down for the check.

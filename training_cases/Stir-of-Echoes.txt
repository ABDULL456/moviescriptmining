STIR OF ECHOES 
Written by 
David Koepp 
Based on the novel 
Richard Matheson 
March 26, 1998 
Sometimes within the brain's old ghostly house, I hear, far off, at some forgotten door, A music and an eerie faint carouse And stir of echoes down the creaking floor. "Chambers of Imagery" Archibald MacLeish 
In the black, a child HUMS. Gentle WATER sounds. 
FADE IN: 
INT A BATHROOM NIGHT JAKE, a four year old boy, sits in a bathtub. The door to thi bathroom is open and his mother is visible in the background, walking back and forth in the bedroom, getting dressed to go out. The STEREO is blaring in the bedroom, the music echoes off the tile in the tiny bathroom. Jake is playing with a plastic airplane. He answers a question. 
JAKE 
YES 
(PAUSE) Sometimes. 
(PAUSE) With my toys. He looks up, but we're close in on him and can't see who he's looking at. JAKE (cont'd) My... blue sword. No! The one with the gray tape around the middle. That one. He lands the airplane on the water. He giggles. JAKE (coast' d) That's silly. MAGGIE (o.s.) (from the bedroom) Jake? You all right in there? 
JAKE (calling out to the door) 
YES! The airplane takes off again. Jake lowers his voice to a whisper. JAKE (cont'd) What? 
(PAUSE) My daddy, but he doesn't know about it yet. He brings the airplane in for a careful water landing and lets go of it. He looks up. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: JAKE (cont' d) Can I ask you a question? He pauses, looks to the door to make sure his mother isn't too close. Moving back now, we see that Jake is all alone in the bathroom, staring at the empty bathtub across from him. JAKE (cont'd) Does it hurt to be dead? 
UNDER THE WATER, the toy airplane sinks and crash lands on the bottom of the tub. 
IN THE BATHROOM, MAGGIE WITZKY, twenty-six or seven, Jake's mom, city girl knows how to take care of herself, pokes her head in the doorway, buttoning up her blouse. 
MAGGIE Who you talkin' to, Jake? He turns to her and whispers. 
JAKE It's a secret. 
CUT TO: 
INT JAKE'S ROOM NIGHT TOM WITZKY, Maggie's age, lean and muscled like somebody who works for a living, lies on Jake's bed next to his son, reading him a story. Jake is nearly asleep. 
TOM Well, I was walking in the night, and I saw nothing scary. For I have never been afraid of anything. Not very. I was deep within the woods when, suddenly, I spied them. I saw a pair of pale green pants with nobody inside them! I wasn't scared. But, yet, I stopped. What could those pants be there for? What could a pair of pants at night be standing in the air for? Maggie leans in the doorway and whispers. 
MAGGIE Is he asleep? My brother's here. 
(CONTINUED) 
HARRY What are you, runnin' for Mayor? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) LENNY, the local crank, pipes up. 
LENNY Hey, did any of you guys see those Dominican crack dealers hangin' around the park again? Everybody GROANS. 
FRANK (to Bobby) What is Lenny doing here? Did you tell him you were having a party?! 
BOBBY Vanessa made me. 
LENNY Yeah, laugh it up, laugh it up, and when you all wake up dead with your throats cut some night -- 
FRANK I mean, I could see if he just heard the noise and wandered in, but to actually invite him into your home.. . 
LENNY -- don't come cryin' to me! 
ACROSS THE ROOM, Philip surveys the selection of females. He sees VANESSA, late twenties, hasn't lost the weight from the last baby yet -- 
PHILIP Not attracted to... -- SHEILA, a thin, nervous woman around Frank's age -- PHILIP (cont' d) Not drunk enough for... -- and a LOUD WOMAN with enormous hair. PHILIP (cont' d) Frightened by... 
LATER, everyone has eaten, some have left, the ones that remain are bombed. A DRUNK COUPLE dances dirty. Frank stares long and hard at someone's cleavage. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Sheila, the nervous woman, stares at Frank, pissed off. He looks at her, gives her a "What?" gesture. Must be married to each other. Tom, on the other side of the room, hears a SHRIEK of women's voice: and turns. He sees Maggie blushing, receiving hugs and congrLtulations from the two or three women around her. 
IN THE :ITCHEN, Vanessa talks to Maggie while she mixes up a blender of Margaritas. The room is jammed with people. 
VANESSA How did you and Tom meet? 
MAGGIE He saved my life. 
VANESSA No, really. 
MAGGIE I'm serious. The summer I was nineteen, I was at Jones Beach, I swam out too far and got a cramp in my leg. There was no way I was gonna make it back. I was goin' down, I was swallowing water and everything. Tom was a lifeguard. I don't know what he was doing out that far, he said he just had a feeling. 
VANESSA Oh my God, did you have sex with him like, that night? 
MAGGIE Had to. He said I'm his slave until I saved him back. 
VANESSA That's so romantic. Bobby and I met when I peed in the guys' john at a Bon Jovi concert. She hits "puree" on the blender. 
STILL LATER, the party's down to the hard-core half dozen, who are passing a joint. Tom sits on the couch, feet on the coffee table next to their baby monitor. Maggie is next to him, Frank and Sheila are jammed in there too. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Bobby and Vanessa sit on the floor opposite. Philip is in a chair at the end. 
VANESSA P(ople who say they were hypnotized weren't really, they were just, you kn)w, playing along. 
PHILIP Then how could they have needles stuck into their throats without bleeding? Without even making a sound? 
FRANK Bullshit. 
PHILIP 
(AUTHORITATIVE) Be quiet. (they do) Look at it. Keep looking at it. Don't look at anything else, just my finger. 
TOM Can you clean out the nail, it's kinda makin' me sick here. Philip raises two fingers and jabs Tom in the eyes. TOM (cont' d) Hey, what the fuck? 
PHILIP Shall we try this again? 
TOM (rubbing his eyes) Asshole. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
PHILIP Look at me, Tom. You're not afraid of this. You want this to happen. Don't you? 
TOM Poke me again you son of a batch and I'll clock you, I swear to Go'.. 
MAGGIE Philip, have you ever done this before? 
PHILIP Maggie, please, I nearly have a master's degree in cognitive psy- 
MAGGIE Have you ever done it before? 
PHILIP Well, I've seen it done a dozen times. 
MAGGIE Try not to screw him up permanently. 
PHILIP (to Tom) You want to be hypnotized. Say yes. 
TOM Yeah. 
PHILIP "I want to be hypnotized." 
TOM I want to be fuckin' hypnotized, already. 
PHILIP Okay. Close your eyes. As Tom does, our eyes close too, big heavy lashes dropping over everything and plunging us into blackness. PHILIP (o.s.) Just listen for a moment. 
IN THE BLACK, we can still hear the sounds of the living room. Tom breathes. Ice CLINKS in a glass as someone drinks. A car HUMS by outside. PHILIP (o.s.) Now look at the backs of your eyelids. Do you see anything there? TOM (o.s.) Uh... Out of the pitch black, we can detect tiny images. TOM (o.s.) Some colors... something floating... up. PHILIP (o . s . ) Focus on it. A small squiggly line comes into focus, drifting up through the black, then bouncing suddenly downward. PHILIP (o.s.) Now... I want you to pretend you're in a theatre. 
INT THEATRE NIGHT We're sitting in a theatre, a bare stage at the front. PHILIP (o . s . ) A movie theatre. 
INT MOVIE THEATRE NIGHT Okay, we're sitting in a movie theatre. It's crowded with people, waiting for the movie to start. PHILIP (o.s.) You're the only one there. The people disappear. The theatre is empty. PHILIP (o . s . ) You're sitting near the front. We pop up ten rows closer to the screen. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: PHILIP (o . s . ) The walls of the theatre are black, covered with black velvet. SHOOOP! Black velvet descends over the walls. PHILIP (o . s . ) The seats are covered with black velvet. Black velvet crawls over the seats. PHILIP (o . s . ) There is no light in the theatre. The lights click off. PHILIP (o . s . ) In the whole pitch-black theatre, there's only one thing you can see. The white screen. You drift toward it, in your chair. Up ahead of us, the screen is a dazzling white. We move slowly toward it, floating over the seats. PHILIP (o . s . ) There are letters up on the screen. Tall, thick, black letters, but they're out of focus. You drift closer to them, trying to read them. Blurry black letters appear on the screen. We drift closer. PHILIP (o. s . ) You're comfortable in your black velvet seat, very comfortable. You just sit there, looking at the screen, drifting closer in your chair, staring at those letters on the screen. You're relaxing. Your feet and ankles are relaxed. Your legs are relaxed. Your hands are limp and heavy. Your arms are relaxed. Your face. The letters come into focus, you're close enough now, you can read them. The letters are right in front of us now, but still blurry. PHILIP (o . s . ) The letters spell -- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) The moment he speaks the word, five giant black letters come into focus on the white screen, filling our entire field of vision. PHILIP (o . s . ) 
SLEEP. We stare at that word for a moment -- -- and then everything goes black. No sound, no image, no nothing. And then... 
INT BOBBY & VANESSA'S LIVING ROOM NIGHT Six faces stare right at us from up close. Tom is in the chair, eyes open, looking disoriented. 
PHILIP Hang on, lemme, I gotta get my bearings here... Who is this again? 
TOM Phil, I gotta get back to work, was there anything else you told me to do after I came out of it? 
PHILIP If you're asking if I gave you a post- 
HYP- 
TOM Post-hypnotic suggestion, I know what it's called, Phil. Did you leave any others behind when you were kickin' your big, clumsy-ass feet around inside my brain? 
PHILIP No. 
TOM Tell me the truth, Phil! 
PHILIP No, I swear! I went out of my way not to, I even added a thing at the end to make sure! 
TOM What thing? 
PHILIP I, I didn't want you to retain any of the experience, you know, I wanted you to have control back, so I made up this thing. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
TOM What thing? 
PHILIP God, I don't remember, I haven't had caffeine in almost eighteen hours, how am I supposed to- 
TOM In general, what was it? 
PHILIP Well, it was perfectly harmless, I just said, uh, I said "When you come out from under, your mind will be completely free. There's nothing binding it. Nothing holding it back. You will be completely open." Tom stops, thinking for a long moment. 
TOM Yeah, I'd say that about describes it. 
PHILIP Describes what? 
TOM Never mind, it's gone now. I gotta go. 
PHILIP Describes what? But Tom has hung up. Philip unplugs the phone and goes back to sleep. 
CUT TO: 
INT KITCHEN DAY Jake sits at the kitchen table in his pajamas, eating a bowl of cereal. Maggie, in work clothes, is walking back and forth behind him, talking on the phone, finishing her makeup, drinking coffee, and doing the dishes. MAGGIE (o . s . ) Hi, Adriana, it's Maggie. Listen, our baby-sitter just backed out on us for next Friday night -- Jake turns and looks at the empty chair next to him. He smiles at it. Then he giggles. He covers his mouth. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: MAGGIE (cont' d) -- and there's this game Tom and I really wanted to go to and I was wondering if... 
JAKE (to the chair) I told him. MAGGIE (o.s.) (into phone) Oh. Yeah, I understand. No, no, no, don't worry about it. Okay. Bye. (hangs up) Shit. Shoot. Shoot, I mean. She picks up the phone and dials again. With all she's doing, she doesn't notice that Jake is having a conversation with the empty chair. MAGGIE (cont' d) (into phone) Philip, hi, it's me, call me when you wake up, is there any way -- 
JAKE Yes. 
MAGGIE -- you'd consider dumping whatever bimbo you're going out with Friday night and baby-sitting for us instead? 
JAKE Who? 
FRANK (to Tom) Don't get me wrong, it's great what the Damon kid is doin' and everything, I mean, I'm sorry your record's gettin' broke, but, what, it held up almost ten years? Tom is terribly distracted, looking back over his shoulder, still plagued with a headache. 
TOM Yeah, `bout that. They round a corner. Just ahead, a high school football field is surrounded by bright lights, mobbed with STUDENTS and PARENTS. A BAND plays on the field, it's just about time for kickoff. 
FRANK (raising his voice over the 
CROWD) So you got that, that's great. What I'm sayin', though, is this year it's all Kurt Damon this and Kurt Damon that, and yeah, the kid has an arm, but high school football is running the ball -- smash-mouth, in-your-face, power football. Always been that way. Tom glances up at a mercury-vapor streetlight as they pass under it. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: The same BUZZING sound, the one he heard when he first looked at Dorothy, comes back now, seeming to come from the street light. Tom shakes it off. FRANK (cost' d) Now Adam, and I admit, L am biased, but my kid is having ona hell of a season and it's like nol.-)dy noticed. If they'd just give him he carries he could break a thousand yards. And on an eight game schedule! He pulls out a pint bottle of schnapps and has a bump, offers one to Tom, who declines. A SEXY TEENAGE GIRL walks past. Frank notices. Carefully. 
BEHIND THEM, Sheila and Maggie walk together. Sheila stares at Frank as he ogles the teenager. 
SHEILA Look at him. Why doesn't he just lick them when they walk by? 
MAGGIE 
(LAUGHS) According to Tom, the average guy carries around a hard-on two and a half hours out of every day. What are you gonna do? 
SHEILA 
(DARKLY) I've got a few ideas. A MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN walks past and Frank gives her the big crank-around. SHEILA (cont' d) Look at that! He's not even picky. I swear to God, that man will stick it in a bowl of soup if it's still warm.. Maggie notices Tom, up ahead, with a hand to his temple. She catches up. 
MAGGIE Are you okay? He forces a smile. They head into a crowded tunnel that leads into the stadium. 
IN THE TUNNEL, Frank raises his voice still higher. It becomes a horrible drone to Tom. 
FRANK Six eighty-three with three game.- left, he only needs to average, ti.iat, a hundred and five, hundred and six yards a game? He hits a thousand and we're talkin' major scholarships, the kid could write his own ticket. That kinda thing's good for everybody, helps the whole neighborhood. He's goin' a hell of a lot farther than I ever did. Look at the quality of the tail he's already gettin'. He passed me in that department when he was about fourteen. He passes Tom the bottle. This time, he takes a swig. 
EXT FOOTBALL FIELD NIGHT They come through the tunnel and into the stands. Below, the field is brightly lit. Frank's voice is, thankfully, drowned out by the enthusiasm of the crowd. They make their way to the first open seats in the bleachers and sit down. The crowd is delirious with anticipation, and a bit loaded -- there's a lot of schnapps in that crowd, and beers snuck in here and there. And that's the grown-ups. 
ON THE FIELD, the visitors kick off. 
IN THE STANDS, the crowd ROARS. Tom tries to concentrate on the game, but he's totally distracted. He looks to the right, drawn by a flash of light. A car is pulling into the parking lot at the end of the field with its high beams on. Tom stares at the lights. The BUZZING sound comes back, louder the longer he stares. The crowd ROARS its approval of something. Tom turns back, tries to follow the game. He wipes sweat from his forehead. Maggie is staring at him. She takes his hand and leans over, SHOUTING into his ear. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MAGGIE 
WHAT'S WRONG? As Tom turns to her, his eye is drawn by something just over her head. A GIANT LIGHT STANCHION towers over them. When Tom s\ares directly into the dozen large globes, the BUZZING souni overwhelms him, nearly deafening. His hands shoot up to his ears -- -- and he leaps to his feet. 
TOM Sf"S TAXING BIM AWWAY! 
MAGGIE 
WHAT?! Tom fights his way out of the row, climbing right over people. They SHOUT their objections. 
INT TUNNEL NIGHT Tom races down the now-empty tunnel. A light shines at the far end, BUZZING madly. A few seconds later, Maggie starts into the tunnel. 
MAGGIE Tom, wait! 
EXT BUSY STREET NIGHT Tom bursts out onto the busy sidewalk, threading his way between PEOPLE and cars as fast as he can. Maggie follows a few moments later. 
TOM Do you want me to call the police? (shakes her head no) Then tell me why you took him. 
DOROTHY He isn't safe in your house. 
TOM Why do you say that? 
DOROTHY He told me! He told me so! The DRIVER of the bus that nearly hit her is out of his bus now. He SHOUTS at them from the other side of the lot. 
TOM Jake said that? (she nods) What else did he say? 
DOROTHY Nothing. I was sitting there, I was watching him sleep, I was just watching him, like I'm supposed to, and... and he sat up in bed, he looked right at me, and he said "I'm not safe in this house." Two times, he said it, and then he went back to sleep. 
TOM Where were you taking him? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
DOROTHY California. To my father's house. My real father, not -- (like poison on her tongue) -- Duane. Jake would be safe at my father's house, we'd both be safe there. 
TOM You too? (she nods) Why aren't you safe here? She doesn't answer. The Driver is coming over to them, still 
SHOUTING. TOM (cont' d) Dorothy? Dorothy, why aren't you safe here? The Driver is still closer. Frightened, Dorothy gets up, to run again. Tom grabs her. TOM (coat' d) Hey, wait a sec- As his hands close around her arms -- 
AN IMAGE flashes through his mind. A MAN'S FACE, sweaty and unshaven, leers over us, too close. 
IN THE PARKING LOT, Tom abruptly pulls back from Dorothy. He is enraged. 
TOM Who is he?! She just looks at him, frightened. He shakes her, violently. TOM (cont' d) 
WHO IS HE?! 
CUT TO: 
INT DOROTHY'S HOUSE NIGHT DUANE, fortyish, slouches on a sofa, watching Moe hit Curly with a rake. Duane's drinking bourbon. In his defense, he is using a glass. Duane's face is the one Tom just saw in the image in his mind. 
(CONTINUED) d16 - - ï¿½ --- .. - - A86i - 
CONTINUED: Duane hears the front door open and close. 
DUANE You're early. Your mom's still at work. Hey, do you know if she bought any more who the fuck are you? Tom is storming across the room toward him. DUANE (cant' d) Hey hey hey hey HEY! Tom already has Duane by the collar. He wrenches him to his feet. DUANE (cont' d) 
WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU'RE 
DOIN'?! 
TOM Are you Duane? 
DUANE Who?! I don't even know who you're- Duane looks over Tom's shoulder. Dorothy is standing in the doorway, frightened. DUANE (cont' d) Dorothy, who the fuck is this guy?! Tom hurls Duane across the coffee table, knocking over Duane's bong. Duane hits the floor hard. He starts fumbling in his pocket, but Tom is on him, ripping him to his feet again. 
TOM She's a little girl, you son of a bitch! She' s fifteen years old, and you fucked her!? What the hell is the matter with you?! YOU DON'T DO SHIT 
LIKE THAT TO PEOPLE WHO CAN'T DEFEND 
THEMSELVES! 
TOM Where did she go? 
DOROTHY I don't know! She don't write or nothin'. Tom looks down at the photograph again. 
TOM What's your sister's name, Dorothy? 
DOROTHY Samantha. 
CUT TO: 
INT TOM i MAGGIE'S HOUSE NIGHT The red light glows on the baby monitor, and Jake's breathing can be heard from in his bedroom. Tom and Maggie sit on the couch in their living room, the nonitor beside them, just one light on. He has his arms arounc' her, holding her tight. His hand is bandaged. They're shaker.. 
MAGGIE Samantha? 
TOM That's what she said. 
MAGGIE Where have I heard that name before? 
TOM Dorothy said she ran away about six months ago. 
MAGGIE But she could still be around! Hiding or something. I mean, she could have actually been here when you saw her! 
TOM If she was, she's very quick getting in and out of a room. 
MAGGIE Where was she? When you saw her, where was she exactly? 
TOM On the cushion right next to you. Maggie looks down at the empty half of the couch, freaked out. She pulls in closer to him. 
MAGGIE What was it like? At the game, I mean, how did you know about Jake? Did you see anything? 
TOM It's hard to explain. I just got this -- feeling. 
MAGGIE Like when I was drowning? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
TOM A little bit. But a hundred times stronger. 
MAGGIE Does it hurt when it happens? 
TOM Like you wouldn't believe. Fecls like my brain is tearing in half. 
MAGGIE God, Tommy, what's the matter with you? 
TOM Why do you assume it's bad? Maybe this is a good thing. 
MAGGIE If your brain is tearing in half? 
TOM I told you there was somethin' in me. Maybe it's comin' out. 
MAGGIE I like it better in. 
TOM Just roll with it. What's the worst that can happen? 
ELIZABETH You've had no head trauma, no serious viral infections you can recall, you haven't been out of the country, you're not a drug user, you have no history of migraines... I suppose I could open up your skull in the operating room and then decide what to do, but I'd rather take a few pictures first, wouldn't you? She pushes through a set of double doors. 
INT MRI ROOM DAY The MRI machine is a long tunnel with a body slab sticking out obscenely, like a tongue. TWO NURSES stand on either side of it. One wall of the room is glass, behind the glass are the TECHNICIANS -- and Maggie, who waves supportively. Tom swallows. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
TOM How's it work? Elizabeth goes to a computer terminal and types in some commands. 
ELIZABETH It creates an electromagnetic field thirty thousand times stronger than the earth's. That stimulates your brain's protons to align themselves. Then we shoot radio waves into you, which knocks the protons out of alignment. They then realign themselves, sending out radio signals we record on the scanner. The computer reads the signals and makes a series of detailed cross-sections of the layers of tissue. Tom looks at the machine, then back at her. 
TOM Can I have another Valium? 
A FEW MINUTES LATER, Tom lies down on the "tongue." The Nurses wrap sheets around his arms and tuck them in under his body, immobilizing them. He looks at one of them questioningly. 
NURSE So your arms don't touch the sides of the machine. 
TOM That would be bad? She smiles and nods. The other Nurse puts a white cloth over his hair. 
NURSE 2 Your party hat. He tries to smile, but he is unnerved. Elizabeth leans in, staring down at Tom. 
ELIZABETH It's so nice you and Maggie finally came to see me at work. 
IN THE CONTROL ROOM, a Technician hits a series of switches. 
IN THE MRI ROOM, the tongue starts to move, sliding into the tunnel. Tom lies still, staring upward as he is pulled inside, like a corpse in a drawer sliding back into the wall of the morgue. 
INSIDE THE MACHINE, it's only about two feet across, and less from top to bottom. Tom blinks, staring up at the ceiling as the tongue comes to a stop. It's incredibly claustrophobic. 
TOM Kinda hot in the coffin. ELIZABETH'S VOICE comes blaring out of speakers mounted on either side of the tunnel. 
ELIZABETH 
YES, IT USUALLY IS AT FIRST, BUT IT 
COOLS DOWN ONCE THE HAMMERS START 
MOVING. 
TOM Yo, hey, hey, woah, I'm right here. Can you turn it down a little bit? 
ELIZABETH 
NO, YOU'LL WANT IT LOUD. WE'RE 
STARTING NOW. 
IN THE CONTROL ROOM, Elizabeth leans back from a microphone and turns to a Technician. 
ELIZABETH Go ahead. The Technician enters some commands on a keyboard. 
IN THE MRI ROOM, the giant "hammers" that are contained in the cylinders that surround the tunnel start to move, slowly at first. 
IN THE CONTROL ROOM, Elizabeth turns to Maggie. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BEHIND THEM, the Cop is still watching them. He walks closer, stops only about ten feet away, staring. Tom glances up, sees him, thinks nothing of it. The 'op steps closer. 
IN THE. WINDOW, Tom sees the reflection of the Cop. Closer now, staring. Tom turns and smiles, tight-lipped. He recognizes him from the other day. The Cop smiles back, doesn't go away. 
TOM (to Jake) Hey, look at that one! He carries Jake to the next window over, a different display. The Cop wanders closer. Tom finally turns to him, tense. TOM (cont' d) How ya doin'? 
COP Fine, fine. He's staring at Jake. 
TOM Is there a law against lookin' in the window now? 
COP Huh? Oh, no, `course not. I'm off duty. I live right up there. 
TOM That's great. See ya later. He sweeps Jake up onto one hip and starts to walk away. 
COP It's even stronger in him than it is in you. Tom stops. Turns back. 
TOM What? The Cop smiles and makes a face -- "you heard me." 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: TOM (cont' d) I don't know what you're talking about. 
COP Jon't be afraid of it. Tom just star .s at the Cop, trembling slightly. The Cop walks forward. Fascinated, Tom does not back away. The Cop lowers his voice. COP (cont' d) You're not alone. Tom is too rattled to speak. COP (cont' d) You don't know about Cacophony yet? Tom shakes his head no. The Cop pulls out a note pad, scribbles something on a page, tears it out and holds it out to Tom. COP (cont' d) Come next time. His hand shaking, Tom accepts the paper. The Cop reaches out and tousles Jake's hair. COP (coast' d) Bye, Jake. The Cop turns and walks away. 
JAKE Bye, Neil! The Cop looks back over his shoulder and smiles. Tom looks at his son as if he's never seen him before. 
CUT TO: 
INT JAKE'S ROOM NIGHT Jake, fresh from a bath and in his pajamas, sits on the floor of his room, playing with model cars, intent. He's HUMMING a soft tune to himself, the same one he hummed during his bath in the opening. Tom and Maggie sit near him, staring at him. They're freaked out. What have they got on their hands here? Their tone is soft, gently probing. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MAGGIE Jake, do you remember the other day when we were talking in the kitchen? Jake doesn't look up, just keeps playing and HUMMING. MAGGIE (cont' d) I was loo3.ing for a baby-sitter, remember? (Jake plays) And you said "Samantha" told you about Dorothy. Do you remember that? He keeps playing, HUMMING. 
TOM Jake? Mommy's asking you a question. Nothing. 
MAGGIE Is Samantha someone who talks to you sometimes, Jake? No answer. She tries a different route. MAGGIE (cont'd) Can you remember any of the things that Saman- Jake looks up sharply. 
JAKE Don't ask the boy any more questions. They freeze, staring at him. His tone was odd. And did he just refer to himself in the third person? JAKE (cant' d) Talk to me. He goes back to playing, and to that little tune. It's becoming rather haunting. Maggie and Tom look at each other. Good God. 
CUT TO: 
INT BEDROOM NIGHT Nighttime. Tom and Maggie are asleep in bed. Suddenly, Tom's eyes pop open. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
TOM She's downstairs. He sits up. His head is killing him again. There's a glass of water on the night table. le grabs it and drinks greedily. He turns and looks to the open -loorway. He swallows. He stands up. He looks down at Maggie, who's still sound asleep. He walks to the door. Maggie stirs, feeling him gone. 
MAGGIE So... you know most of the people around here pretty well, right? 
IN FRONT OF BERNIE'S TAP, somebody actually manages to catch one of the passes coming from out of the bar and is immediately tackled by three drunks. On the pavement. Ouch. 
IN THE CROWD, Tom is now talking to Harry Damon. 
HARRY But, you know, what am I gonna do, I'm a single father with a son to support, I can' t just say fuck everything. So I scraped together enough money to make a few downpayments, and here I am. A landlord, for Christ's sake. 
TOM So you've been in this neighborhood a long time, right? 
MAGGIE is questioning Sheila. 
MAGGIE Did you ever hear of a girl named Samantha Muller? 
SHEILA 
(THINKS) From over by Baldwin? 
MAGGIE I think so. 
SHEILA Yeah, kinda, name rings a bell. 
HARRY DAMON, in response to the same question from Tom, calls over to his son Kurt, the good-looking football player, who is leaning against the front of his yellow Trans-Am, talking to a couple other guys. 
HARRY Hey, Kurt, you remember that Muller girl? (to Tom) Like he ever tells me anything. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: The music coming from the car is too loud, Kurt can't hear. HARRY (cont' d) 
(SHOUTING) 
DO YOU REMEMBER THE -- COME OVER HERE ! He gestures. Kurt drags himself off the hood and saunters over. HARRY (cont' d) Do you remember that Muller girl? 
KURT What, Dorothy? He makes a "big breasts" gesture. 
HARRY No, the other one. Samantha. Lenny, the crank, joins the conversation. 
LENNY You mean the retard? She ran away. 
HARRY She did? 
SHEILA is on the same subject. 
SHEILA She was always hanging around the guys, you know, she wanted to be with the "in" clique and everything. There wasn't much chance of that. 
HARRY DAMON, asks Tom a question. 
HARRY Why you wanna know about her? 
TOM Oh, Dorothy baby-sits for us sometimes and she started talking about her sister, wonderin' how she was doing and stuff. I promised her I'd ask around, see if anybody'd heard anything from her.

TOM Uh... Frank? But Frank's not on the porch either. Tom steps outside. 
EXT FRONT PORCH DAY It's a beautiful day, but the street is still kind of a mess from the party yesterday. A SHOUT draws Tom's attention. Those same two kids ride their bikes at each other, full tilt. Tom walks down the steps of the porch, staring at them as they SCREAM. At the last second, one of the kids turns away. The other taunts him with cries of "Chicken!" Tom stands frozen on the sidewalk. A bird swoops low over his head; he really flinches this time. The Mailman waves to him, headed down the block. Too stunned, Tom doesn't wave back. He turns, panicked, and looks at Frank's house. He starts to walk toward it, slowly at first, then picking up speed, jogging across the driveway. He's halfway there -- -- when a GUNSHOT rings out from inside. 
TOM Oh, God... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: He races the rest of the way, bounds up the steps to the house, rips open the screen door. But the front door is locked. He POUNDS on it. TOM (coast' d) 
ADAM?! ADAM, OPEN THE DOOR!! He POUNDS harder, but there's no answer. He goes to the window beside the door and peers through it. 
THROUGH THE WINDOW, he sees Adam lying on the floor in the middle of the living room. 
ON THE PORCH, 
TOM Oh, God, no! Tom picks up a porch chair and heaves it through the window. 
INT FRANK'S HOUSE DAY Glass SHATTERS and sprays all over the floor. Tom knocks the rest out of the frame with his elbow and climbs into the house. He races over to Adam's body. There is a pool of blood around his chest and his body is convulsing. In his right hand, he clutches a 38 with a carved white handle. 
TOM Oh, God, no, Jesus, no, please... He grabs a blanket off a chair nearby, presses it to Adam's chest, trying to stop the bleeding. TOM (cont' d) This is really happening.., it's really happening... 
CUT TO: 
EXT OUR BLOCK DAY Tom sits on his front steps, shell shocked, red light flashing off his face. An ambulance and two police cars are parked in front of the house next door, radios SQUAWKING with official activity. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Tom just stares. A car comes barreling around the corner and SQUEALS to a halt in front of the house. Frank and Sheila leap out of the car and race toward the house. Tom watches as they're intercepted-by a COP who tries to restrain them for a second. But they're hysterical, they've obviously been told something serious has happened and they're desperate to get inside. They blow past the Cop and hurry up the stairs, just as THREE PARAMEDICS wheel a stretcher out of the house, headed for the ambulance. The sheet isn't over Adam's head, at least, but that's about the only good sign, they're working on him frantically. Tom buries his head in his lap as he hears the cries of Adam's parents -- Frank's anguished, disbelieving BELLOW, Sheila's horrified SCREAM. 
CUT TO: 
INT LIVING ROOM NIGHT CLOSE ON a torn off piece of notebook paper with an address and a time scribbled on it. The word "Cacophony" is legible. Maggie picks it up, stares at it for a moment, then hands it to Tom, who is by the front door, zipping his jacket. He takes it and shoves it in his pocket. He's nervous. They both are. She smooths his jacket. He turns to go, but she tightens her grip on his jacket. Doesn't want to let him go. 
TOM We need some answers, right? Maybe they're the only ones who have any. She nods. Thinking of something, she picks up her car keys from the table by the door and pulls something off the ring. 
MAGGIE I'm sure they're very nice people, but in case they aren't -- She hands a thin black cannister to him. MAGGIE (coat' d) Mace the shit out of `em. He smiles and shoves it in his pocket. She kisses him. 
EXT DINGY STREET NIGHT Tom walks down a street in a dodgy neighborhood at night, checking addresses. He stops and looks up, at an old, formerly grand apartment building that's fallen on hard times. 
INT BUILDING - CORRIDOR NIGHT The corridor is even creepier. And massive. Tom reaches a door all the way at the end and knocks. A moment later, the door opens. A very heavy-set woman in a floral print dress (VIVIAN) smiles at him. 
VIVIAN I hope you like fondue! 
INT VIVIAN'S APARTMENT NIGHT Vivian sets a plate down on a TV tray in front of Tom. There is a pile of chunks of various hard-to-identify meats, a silver fondue spear, and a chocolate cupcake with an American flag stuck in it. Tom sits on an overstuffed couch that's leaking stuffing. 
VIVIAN Dip away! 
TOM Thank you. Listen, is, uh -- Vivian gives another plate to a man sitting next to Tom, HERMAN, in his seventies, in a wheelchair, an oxygen tube running into his nostrils. TOM (coat' d) Is there a guy named Neil here? He's a cop? 
VIVIAN Well, of course he is! She turns and heads back into the kitchen, passing BEVERLY, her identical twin, who's wearing the same print dress, this one with a red background instead of blue. Beverly serves two people on the far couch, one a THIRTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL, the other a HOMEY in his early twenties. Tom picks up a ham chunk and looks at the steaming fondue pot, full of cheese. Beverly dips and eats, winks at him, and flits off across the room. Herman turns to Tom and asks something in a raspy voice. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
TOM What does what want me to do? 
HERMAN You saw a ghos-, didn't you? 
Z 'M Yeah. Twice. t. girl that disappeared from my neighborhood. Now the kid next door just tried to kill himself. I think he knew something, but now I'll never know what it was. And I gotta know. 
HERMAN Look, what'd the bitch want? 
TOM Why do you assume she wants something? 
NEIL They always do. Something they need finished, something they can't do any more. 
TOM Why me? 
NEIL Because she's confused. Doesn't know why other people won't answer her. She only knows that you will. If she hasn't asked for something yet, she will. And once they ask, it's very difficult to stop yourself from doing it. 
TOM What do you mean? She can, it can make me do something I don't want to do? 
NEIL Oh, no. You'll want to. Badly. You won't think about anything else. You won't sleep. You won't eat. You'll lie. And God help anyone who tries to stop you. 
TOM What if I stop me? What if I just don't do it? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (5) 
HERMAN Then you got a weird bitch friend for the rest of your life. 
NEIL Just listen to her, Tom Let her tell you what she wants. 
CUT TO: 
INT PHILIP'S APARTMENT - HALLWAY NIGHT A HAND pounds on an apartment door. Philip opens up. He was asleep. 
PHILIP What, what, what? 
TOM I want you to hypnotize me again. 
INT PHILIP'S APARTMENT NIGHT Tom paces the floor in Philip's apartment. 
PHILIP Just slow down, you gotta be a little patient with me here, `cause, um... well, Tom, Tom, I've got a confession to make. See I, I, I just smoked this great big fatty a few minutes before you walked in, so this shit you're tellin' me here is fuckin' with my mind just a little bit extra, okay? Tom grabs a chair from Philip's desk and sits. 
TOM Do it. 
MOMENTS LATER, they sit face to face. 
PHILIP Okay. Close your eyes. Tom closes his eyes. 
IN THE BLACK, PHILIP (o.s.) Just like last time -- I want you to concentrate. Listen to the room around you. Tom listens. The factory CHURNS softly outsioi the windows. A few CARS in the street below. His BREATHING. PHILIP (cont' d) Now focus. Concentrate. Look at the backs of your eyelids. Do you see anything there? 
IN PHILIP'S APARTMENT, 
TOM (opens his eyes) Would you just get to it, please? 
PHILIP All right, all right. Tom closes his eyes again. PHILIP (cont' d) I want you to pretend you're in a movie theatre. 
TOM She told me what she wants. 
CUT TO: 
EXT TOM & MAGGIE'S HOUSE DAY Maggie's Sentra pulls into the driveway of their house, parking behind Tom's phone company truck. She gets out, dressed in work clothes, and pulls two bags of groceries out of the trunk. She looks at Tom's truck, then at her watch. Home already? 
INT TOM & MAGGIE'S HOUSE DAY Maggie comes in the front door. 
MAGGIE (calling out) Hey! You're home early! She struggles to take the keys out of the door while still holding the groceries. MAGGIE (cont' d) Can you pick up Jake? I'm exhausted! She comes in and kicks the door shut behind her. Tom's nowhere to be seen. From somewhere in back, there is a faint CRUNCHING sound. MAGGIE (cont' d) Hello? No answer. She heads into the kitchen with the groceries. 
INT KITCHEN DAY In the kitchen, a letter is waiting in the tray of an old fax machine on the counter. Maggie stops in the doorway, staring at the floor. Muddy footprints lead into and out of the kitchen, through the door to the back. Thick chunks of wet mud are everywhere. 
MAGGIE Hey, look what I'm not cleaning up. She sets the groceries down on the counter and pulls out a gallon of milk. She opens the refrigerator. She does a double take. The entire top shelf is jammed with cardboard cartons of orange juice. From outside, the CRUNCHING sound comes again. She follows the muddy footprints out the kitchen door. 
EXT BACK YARD DAY The back yard is smallish, but it's a nice little patch of grass. Used to be, anyway, because now there are three large holes in it, dug seemingly at random locations. Large piles of dirt and rock are heaved up next to the holes. Tom stands in one of t1.e holes, his back to Maggie, hoisting a large pick axe high over his head. CRUNCH. He brings the pick down, into the hole. Busy guy. Maggie is aghast. She walks slowly across the yard, past a pile of shovels and buckets and other tools. She draws closer to him. 
MAGGIE Tom? Tom raises the pick high and brings it down hard. CRUNCH. The hole he's in at the moment isn't more than two or three feet deep. But, hey, it's early. Maggie draws closer. In between swings -- MAGGIE (coast' d) Tom. Tom whirls, the pick raised to defend himself. His shirt's off, his chest and face are streaked with mud and sweat. Maggie jumps back. 
TOM You scared me. And with that, he turns back to the job. Swing. CRUNCH. 
MAGGIE S scared you? Swing. CRUNCH. MAGGIE (cont' d) Tom. Swing. CRUNCH. MAGGIE (cont' d) What are you doing? 
TOM (doesn't turn around) I'm supposed to dig. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Swing. CRUNCH. Maggie walks around him, so she's facing him. He keeps working. 
MAGGIE What do you mean? Zom shrugs. Swings the pick. 
TOM I'm supposed to dig. 
MAGGIE Who says? He just looks at her from under his sweaty brows. You know who. MAGGIE (cont' d) Oh. Tom manages to break apart the rock he was working on with the pick. He tosses the axe, which bounces crazily across the grass at Maggie's feet. She jumps out of the way. He hoists himself out of the hole and picks up the garden hose. He sprays water into the hole. MAGGIE (cont' d) Why are you doing this? 
TOM Water softens up the dirt. He tosses the hose aside and grabs a shovel. He jumps back in the hole and starts to dig. 
MAGGIE No, I mean... Could you stop for a minute? (he keeps digging) Would you please stop for a minute? 
TOM What don' t you get? I'm supposed to dig. 
MAGGIE 
TOM! I'M ASKING YOU TO STOP FOR ONE 
MINUTE! He looks up, supremely irritated, and leans on the shovel. "Well?" 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) MAGGIE (coat' d) M2y are you digging? 
TOM (isn't it obvious?), I'm searching. 
MAGGIE What are you searching for? 
TOM The question isn't "what." We both know very well "what," even if we don't want to may it out loud. The question, Maggie, which, as you can plainly see, I am very busy trying to answer -- the question is "Where?" 
MAGGIE Do I WANT you to come with me:! To my MOTHER'S FUNERAL?! Of COURSE L want you to come, why the hell WOULLV'T you come?! But he's looking past her, at the holes in the yard. 
TOM I'm just... kind of in the middle of something here. She looks at him, absolutely incredulous -- -- and then storms back into the house, SLAMMING the door so hard two of the glass panes spiderweb. 
CUT TO: 
EXT DRIVEWAY DAY Jake, twisted around in his car seat, looks out the back window of Maggie's car. He raises one hand, waving. Tom stands in the open doorway of the garage, still in his mud- stained jeans and tee shirt. He waves back. The car pulls out of the driveway, fast, and ROARS off down the block. Jake and Maggie are gone. 
EXT BACK YARD DAY There are now five large holes in the back yard, and Tom is running out of places to dig. Nevertheless, he drags the hose across the yard to an untouched patch of grass in the far corner. He stops short. Hose won't reach. 
AT THE SPIGOT, he unscrews the hose and carries it across the yard. 
AT ANOTHER SPIGOT, this one in the far corner, he reconnects the hose and turns on the water. Nothing comes out. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
TOM Come on! Tom curses and trudges back toward the house. 
INT KITCHEN DAY Tom gets a screwdriver from a tool drawer in the kit-hen. 
INT DINING ROOM DAY Tom stomps into the dining room and goes to a closet on the far wall. He opens the door and tosses aside a carpet flap that covers the floor. He shoves the screwdriver into a crack in the floor and pries up a trap door, two feet square, in the middle of the closet floor. Through the hole, he can see a ladder resting up against the wall below. He feels for the rungs with his feet and starts to climb down. 
INT BASEMENT DAY As Tom climbs down, he reaches out for a chain that hangs from a bare bulb in the ceiling and turns it on. They have only a partial basement, a ten by ten foot space about eight feet deep. The rest of the area under the house is just crawl space, barely enough to wriggle through. Tom reaches the bottom and goes to the far side, where a mess of water pipes all converge. He picks through them, finds the valves that lead outside, turns one off and another one on. WATER surges through the pipes, headed out to the far spigot. He turns to climb back up the ladder. And stops. He looks down, at the floor. It's dirt. He kicks at the dirt with his shoe, thinking. 
A FEW MINUTES LATER, the pick axe falls. Tom has brought all his tools into the basement and is now digging in the middle of the basement floor. The bare bulb throws his exaggerated shadow on the earthen walls. He works. 
EXT OUR BLOCK DAY It's quiet in the neighborhood. The CRUNCHING sound of Tom's pick axe falling echoes over the block. 
INT BASEMENT DAY Tom digs. The hole is almost four feet across, five feet deep. He's uncovered a large rock, a major chunk of stone, right in the middle of where he wants to dig. He's excavated all around the edges of the thing and is trying to wedge it loose with a pry bar, but it won't budge. Tom collapses onto the floor, leaning against the pile of mud and stone he's already hauled out. He thinks. 
CUT TO: 
INT YARD SUPPLY WAREHOUSE DAY Tom walks down an aisle along one wall in a huge yard supply warehouse. Tools are mounted on the wall for sale -- shovels, picks, post hole diggers. Got all that. Tom keeps walking. The tools get bigger. Huge shovels. Tractor blades. Hand pile drivers. Almost, but not quite. Tom keeps walking. At the end of the row, underneath a sign that says "FOR RENTAL ONLY" is an industrial-size jackhammer, the kind road crews use to bust through whatever's in their way. Tom's face lights up. 
EXT STREET DAY The jackhammer rides in the back of Tom's pickup truck, rattling along as the truck bounces over potholes. Tom pulls into his driveway, comes around, and drops the gate. Using all his strength, he wrestles the jackhammer out of the back of the truck. It's incredibly heavy, it takes all his strength to haul it up the stairs, kick open his door, and bring it into the house. 
IN THE STREET, Lenny, the neighborhood crank, is washing his car. He hears a CRASH from over at Tom's place and turns. He sees Tom at his pickup, lugging a huge air compressor out of it. Tom fights his way into the house with the compressor. Lenny stares at him. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Sheila, carrying flowers and looking like didn't sleep last night, comes out of her house and heads for her car. She stops and stares too. 
INT BASEMENT DAY In Tom's basement, the compressor descends through the trap door above, seemingly of its own accord -- than we see it's at the end of a rope and Tom is up in the trap door space, sweating and straining, lowering the thing down. It settles on the floor next to the jackhammer. 
A BIT LATER, Tom reaches up to the hanging light bulb, which also has an electrical outlet in its fixture, and plugs in a yellow safety cord. He flicks a switch on the compressor and it RATTLES to life. He follows a hose over to where it plugs into the side of the jackhammer, which now quivers with unleashed power. Tom picks up the jackhammer. He hauls it over to the rock that's been in his way. He positions the jackhammer's spike on the top of the rock. He lowers a pair of goggles over his eyes. He swings his weight up, onto the jackhammer, and squeezes the handles. The jackhammer ROARS to life. It's deafening. Tom's whole body quivers. It's like riding a bull, but the rock begins to split in half. Tom WHOOPS with joy, barely heard over the din that echoes in his basement. 
EXT STREET DUSK As the sun goes down, the sound of the ROARING jackhammer is plainly audible on the block. The familiar Homeless Guy stops and SHOUTS something at Tom's house. Across the street, Kurt Damon comes out his front door and stares at Tom's house. What the hell is that guy up to? 
CUT TO: 
INT UNCLE STEVE'S HOUSE NIGHT A group of PEOPLE IN DARK CLOTHES mill around a living room, muttering in the soft tones of those at a wake. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MAGGIE What? 
JAKE I want to stay at Uncle Steve's, I don't want to go home. 
MAGGIE Why not? 
JAKE Because I'm not safe there. Because of the feathers. 
MAGGIE What does that mean, Jake? He shrugs. Philip, Maggie's brother, stands in the doorway to the other room. 
PHILIP It's okay, I can watch him. Maggie, in a hurry, agrees. She bends over and kisses Jake on the forehead. 
MAGGIE Be good. She opens the door and heads out. As it's swinging shut: 
JAKE Don't stop for the train, Mommy. 
EXT UNCLE STEVE'S HOUSE NIGHT Maggie hears that just as the door closes behind her. She misses a step, thinking about it, then starts walking to her car. She walks faster. Then she runs. 
CUT TO: 
INT BASEMENT NIGHT In the basement, Tom abruptly stops digging, staring at the dirt. The corner of something shiny is sticking out from the pile. He bends down and pulls it out. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: It's a piece of clear blue plastic sheeting, about two inches square. Tom's hand starts to shake as he holds it. 
AN IMAGE flas.es through his mind again, the one he's seen twice befoi-. A FACE, too close to his, sting at him through that blurr blue, like through bad eyeglasses. 
IN THE BASEMENT, Tom turns and leaps into the hole, shovel in hand. He begins to dig, wildly, flinging dirt in all directions. At one end of the hole, his shovel slips, the dirt spilling off it as it sticks on something. Something buried. Tom drops the shovel. He falls to his knees and uses his hands to rake the dirt away from whatever it was. More blue plastic. Tom tugs out about eight inches of the plastic, gets a good grip on it with both hands. He pulls it up. Like a rope pulled out of the sand, the edge of the blue plastic rises up, unearthing itself in a line down the middle of the pit. Breathing hard, Tom grabs the shovel again. 
THE DIRT, flies away from the plastic as Tom works furiously. 
TOM'S FACE is of a man possessed. He digs as fast as he can. 
FINALLY, Tom stands back, staring down at what he has unearthed. Above him, we see what it is. A long piece of blue plastic, wrapped around something about five and a half feet long and two and a half feet wide. Tom bends down and lays one hand on the plastic. He flinches. 
AN IMAGE pops into his mind, another familiar one. A FIGURE IN Afl OVERCOAT, standing on the front porch of Tom's own house in winter, waving to us to come up. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
IN THE BASEMENT, Tom jerks his hand off the plastic. He swallows. He goes to hi= toolbox and pulls out a utility knife. He slides the ra or blade forward. He goes to one and of the plastic, bends down, and jams the knife through the sheeting. He walks the length of it, making a slit down the middle. He reaches out with shaking hands and pulls part of the plastic back. The first thing he sees is a partially decomposed human hand. Around the withered wrist, there are a half dozen multi- colored bracelets. Tom yanks the rest of the plastic away, revealing the half- decomposed body of Samantha Muller, still in the black dress with the diamond pattern. Tom stands there, his chest heaving. He looks at her hand, thinking. He sits down next to her. He reaches out for her hand, then pulls his own back. Can't do it. But he's gotta. He opens his hand, reaching out for hers. He slides his hand underneath -- takes a deep breath -- -- and closes his living fingers around her skeletal ones. He GASPS. His face turns a horrible shade of pale, his lips go ice blue, and STEAM comes out of his mouth, the way it did hers when he first saw her in his living room. 
EXT TOM'S HOUSE DAY It's a wintry day. That same steam rises up in front of us, coming from our own mouth. We're looking at the front porch of Tom's house as we walk past it. The house is being remodeled, it's surrounded by scaffolding, its windows covered with plastic Duvateen. The Figure in the Overcoat waves to us. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
FIGURE Hi! 
SAMANTHA (off screen, we're in her point of vie sr) Hi. 
(MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) KURT (cont' d) Just be nice to me. Be a good girl. You're a good girl, aren't you? 
SAMANTHA I have to go home. We struggle some more. He gets his powerful hanis on our shoulders and starts to push us down. 
KURT Come on, baby, how `bout a little helmet wash? His belt buckle comes into our view, and his hands on it. We tear away, get up and run for the door. From behind, something hits us very hard. The floorboards race up at us, all of a sudden. We land on them, hard, bounce off, our own blood spraying out on the unfinished wood. Our head lands sideways on the floor. We see Adam McCarthy, vomiting in the corner. Abruptly, we're rolled over and are staring at the ceiling. Kurt Damon is on top of us, his face too close. Her hands rise up, try to push him off, but he's stronger. Samantha starts to SCREAM. Hands close over our face. She bites, and the hands are pulled away. She SCREAMS again. KURT (cont' d) 
SHUT UP! SHUT UP! Kurt holds her down, begins to try to undress her. She writhes and SCREAMS. She gets one hand into Kurt's hair and pulls as hard as she can. He SHOUTS in pain. In the corner, Adam McCarthy has his hands over his ears. 
ADAM 
MAKE HER STOP! MAKE HER STOP 
SCREAMIN', MAN, MAKE HER STOP! But she keeps screaming. Adam staggers to a boom box that's sitting on the fireplace mantle and flicks a switch. A SONG comes on, loud. It's a haunting tune, we recognize it. St's the song Jake has been humming. Kurt continues his fumbling, drunken attempts at rape, tearing her hand out of his hair. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) 
KURT 
SHUT HER UP! USE YOUR JACKET OR 
SOMETHING' Adam lunges to the wall and tears down a sheet of the blts plastic Duvateen. He races over to us with the sheet -- -- and everything turns blue. Now our sights and sounds aye muffled and distorted through the blue plastic. We see the image that has haunted Tom, the face of Kurt Damon, a blue demon as he grapples on top of us. 
IN TOM'S BASEMENT, Tom is sprawled out beside the corpse, their hands locked together. His color is cadaverous. He's suffocating. He thrashes. 
IN THE HOUSE, back in Samantha's point of view, we struggle, we thrash, it seems to go on forever. Slowly, the sounds become fainter and fainter and fainter... and everything stops. We hear the muffled voices of Kurt and Adam SCREAMING at each other. The sheet is ripped off. We stare up at them as Kurt and Adam stand above us, chests heaving, revolted looks on their faces, looking at us like we're a dog they just killed with their car. 
ADAM Oh, my God. 
KURT What the fuck did you do that for? 
ADAM Is she dead? 
KURT No shit she's dead. 
ADAM Oh, my God. 
KURT Look at her tongue, man. 
ADAM I'm not here. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
KURT I never saw nobody dead before. We start to fall back, and down, as if sinking into the floor. Kurt and Adam grow taller, further away. Their voices fade. 
ADAM I wish I wasn't here. 
KURT It's fuckin' gross. 
FRANK You don't know it was Adam and Kurt. 
TOM It was. 
FRANK But there's nothing to... you're talking like a nut, that's what people will say. This is just a body, it doesn't prove anything. 
TOM No, it doesn't. He bends down and lifts Samantha's lifeless hand. He pries open her fingers. She's clutching a tuft of hair. TOM (cont' d) But this probably will. Frank stares for a long moment, struck dumb. Finally, he turns his back. His shoulders heave as he cries, silently. 
EXT OUR BLOCK NIGHT In the misty night, the figures of Harry and Kurt Damon come out of their house and skulk across the street, toward Tom's. 
EXT ROAD INTO TOWN NIGHT Maggie drives, as fast as she can. Up ahead, red lights flash and gates fall in front of a set of railroad tracks. Train coming. Cars are stopped, waiting for it. Maggie pulls to a stop at the back of the line -- -- then thinks better of it. She drops the car in gear, hauls it around the others, and bolts for the tracks. The train, nearly upon her, BLARES its horn. Maggie flies across the tracks and SLAMS through the gate on the other side, a split-second before the train HURTLES through the intersection behind her. She cuts it hard to the right to miss the waiting cars on the other side, and pulls it back on the road. She drives on, shaking like a leaf. 
INT BASEMENT NIGHT Frank is still sobbing, his back to Tom. Tom takes a step toward him, to comfort him. 
TOM 
FRANK- 
FRANK I mean... 
TOM Frank, we have to- 
FRANK I mean, what were we supposed to do? Tom stops. FRANK (cont' d) The kids come to us, she's already dead, the damage is done, there's nothin' gonna bring her back. But those boys, they've got everything ahead of them. Frank lets his jacket drop to the floor, revealing his right hand. He's holding the 38 with the carved white handle. He turns and looks at Tom. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: FRANK (coast' d) What were we supposed to do? Send our boys to jail for the rest of their lives? Our own flesh and blood? Over her? 
E3 T HOUSE NIGHT Hairy and Kurt Damon reach the front steps of Tom's house. They look up and down the block. There's no one out. No one to see. 
INT BASEMENT NIGHT Frank still has the gun hanging at his side, tears streaming down his cheeks. 
TOM Who you planning to shoot with that? 
FRANK Who do you think? 
TOM I think you haven't decided yet. He's right, and Frank knows it. 
FRANK Get out of here. 
TOM What are you gonna do, Frank? Frank raises the gun, in a fury. 
FRANK 
I BEEN LIVIN' WITH THIS FOR ALMOST A 
YEAR, YOU THINK ANYTHING YOU SAY IS 
GONNA MAKE ONE BIT OF DIFFERENCE TO 
ME?! GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE! 
TOM Frank, I won't go until you- Frank aims the gun just to the left of Tom's head and pulls the trigger. The bullet CRACKS off the ladder. 
FRANK

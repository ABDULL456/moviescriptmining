Written by 
Peter Hewitt, William Osborne & Michael McCullers 
Animated scenes of the Thunderbirds on various rescues begin to play as some of the cast and crew names show up. 
NARRATOR From a secret island in the South Pacific, the courageous Tracy family run an organization called International Rescue. When disaster strikes, anywhere in the world, they are always first on the scene. They go by the name they gave their incredible machines, the Thunderbirds. 
(Counts down numbers and shows corresponding Thunderbirds) Five, four, three, two, one. Thunderbirds are go! 
Cuts to live action, Alan Tracy is looking out a school window. 
But in this family of heroes, there is one son left behind. 
TEACHER So, gentlemen, we all know that A2 plus B2 equals... C2, that's right. But what happens when we bring in Leonardo Da Vinci's E, F and... (Teacher notices Alan looking out window and not paying attention to the lesson) Mr. Tracy! 
FERMAT Alan. Alan! 
Alan's head jerks back from the window and to the teacher who is now standing in front of him. 
TEACHER How kind of you to come back from outer space, Alan. I trust re-entry wasn't too rough? 
(Chuckles sarcastically and continues sounding even more annoyed) Here on Earth we've been discussing the Pythagorean theorem. Did any of that happen to sink in? 
ALAN TRACY I was just... 
TEACHER Apparently not (she picks up his notebook which he has been doodling in) "Thunderbirds are go." 
Well, I hope you aren't going anywhere special over spring break, Alan. Because I expect a 10,000 word paper on my desk the day you get back. That should keep you busy. 
Bells rings dismissing the students and Alan and Fermat walk out to their lockers. 
ALAN (mocking the teacher) "That should keep you busy. Yeah, well you can take your 10,000 words and stick them right up your..." 
FERMAT Alan! 
Both boys turn around to see the headmaster approaching them while walking by with the teacher from before 
ALAN Headmaster. 
HEADMASTER Mr. Tracy! 
ALAN Miss Garrett. 
FERMAT You gotta be more careful Alan. 
ALAN Why can't I tell 'em I'm a Thunderbird Fermat? 
FERMAT Because technically you're not a Thunderbirds yet. And if your identity was discovered, it would a d-d-di- it could be very bad. 
ALAN I know, I know. 
EXCITED KID It's the Thunderbirds. They're gonna be on TV. Let's go! They're gonna be on TV. 
ALAN Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Where are they? 
EXCITED KID In Russia, at an oil rig fire. 
CREW MEMBER Come on! Jump! 
VIRGIL Okay, I've got a visual. Hold it there. Targets locked. Firing rescue lines. (Directed toward the 
crew members who he just fired the rescue lines toward) Come on, guys, hook 'em up. We gotta get 
you out of here. 
CREW MEMBER READY 
ANOTHER CREW MEMBER HOIST AWAY! 
JEFF Alright, let's haul them out. 
FERMAT Commencing reverse thrust. 
JEFF Okay, let's bring 'em home. 
CREW MEMBER Look out! (a couple of crew members bump into each other as they are hoisted up) 
ALAN Man they gotta get 'em out fast. That rig's gonna blow. 
CREW MEMBER Hang on! 
Boys watching the TV gasp as the crew goes down back toward the water a little bit 
JEFF Whoa sorry, boys. Hold on tight. Here we go. 
ALAN Come on, Virgil. 
VIRGIL Hold on guys 
JEFF How you doing, son? 
VIRGIL Never better 
JEFF Thunderbird 1, commence knockdown procedure. 
SCOTT FAB, Thunderbird 2. (after pressing a bunch of buttons on his control panel) Lining up target. 
Fire! 
JEFF Bull's-eye! Outstanding shot. All right boys, let's take these babies home. 
LISA LOWE As you can see the fire has been extinguished. The rocket fired from Thunderbird 1 has 
robbed it of the oxygen it needed to burn. Amazing! The Thunderbirds have done it again, Chuck! ' 
The boys watching the TV with Alan and Fermat begin cheering. 
CHUCK That was great work, Lisa. Thanks a lot. 
KNOW IT ALL KID (directed at Alan) Ooh, I wish I could be a Thunderbird one 
day. Thunderturd! 
The boys in the room "ooohh" and look at Alan for a response 
ALAN That's another good one, diaper boy. 
LADY PENELOPE Oh and apparently England won the football last night. 
PARKER Yes! Eng-er-land! (his hands go off the steering wheel and the car begins to move to one side) 
FERMAT AND ALAN Whoa! 
LADY PENELOPE Calm down, Parker. 
PARKER Yes, milady. Sorry, milady. 
SCENE CHANGE TO San Francisco City Hospital California, USA parking lot. 
PANHEAD'S MOTHER Come on, baby. Out you jump. (Turns to her teenage son who has a pan stuck on 
his head) Wait till your father hears about this, panhead! They are walking toward the hospital 
entrance when she sees the lights of Thunderbird 2 Aliens! 
PANHEAD Even better! It's the Thunderbirds! 
VIRGIL OK, lock it up. Let's go. Let's move it. Hey, we need some help over here. 
JEFF Mission complete. Thunderbird 1 we are good to go. 
SCOTT FAB. 
Mullion walks away from the others and fires a tracking goo at Thunderbird 1. 
Scene switches to a moving underwater submarine 
MALE COMPUTER VOICE Tracking device, activated. 
THE HOOD Ah, the chariot of the gods. Having dallied with the mortals, 
they return to Olympus. And so I follow. 
PARKER Pardon me, milady. Approaching Tracy Island. And radar indicates we have some company. 
Thunderbird 1 and 2 pull up next to Lady Penelope's flying car and Scott waves at Alan before Alan 
turns to look at Thunderbird 2 where his father salutes at him. Thunderbird 1 then does a barrel roll 
around Thunderbird 2 before they both jet off toward the island, leaving Lady Penelope's car behind. 
LADY PENELOPE Now, that's showing off. 
ALAN I wish that was me. 
BRAINS I'm about to run post flight checks, Mr Tracy. Anything I sh-sh-sh- 
Anything you want to tell me? 
JEFF Brains, I noticed a build-up of vibration on Thunderbird 2, followed by illumination of the number 5 
engine out light. 
BRAINS Okay, Mr. Tracy, I'll ch-ch-ch-study the flight data and guidance processor. 
ALAN Dad! 
KYRANO By the pool. 
JEFF Of course. 
LADY PENELOPE (answers her ringing cell phone) Parker. 
Scene changes to Alan and Fermat about to enter Thunderbird 1's silo. 
FERMAT We're not supposed to go in there. We could get in trouble. 
ALAN Ah, you worry too much. 
FERMAT Where'd you get the access code for Thunderbird 1 anyway? 
ALAN Fermat, my friend, what you don't know, can't hurt you. 
Scene changes back to Lady Penelope and Jeff by the pool 
LADY PENELOPE I'll be right there. It seems the fire at the oil rig was no accident. 
JEFF Any suspects? 
LADY PENELOPE Not yet, but I'll keep you posted. 
ALAN Thanks for bringing Alan home. 
LADY PENELOPE My pleasure. Any excuse to visit paradise. 
JEFF Tintin! 
TINTIN Hey, Mr. Tracy. 
LADY PENELOPE Hello, Tintin. 
TINTIN Good evening, Lady Penelope. 
JEFF Did you know Alan's home? 
TINTIN (makes an annoyed face) Alan's back? (changes her tone to a more pleasant one) I mean, oh, 
Alan's back! (looks at Kyrano) Hey, Dad. 
JEFF When are those two going to get along? 
LADY PENELOPE When Tintin decides the time is right. Girls always fire ahead of boys with that sort of 
thing. 
JEFF What sort of thing? 
LADY PENELOPE (rolls her eyes) Romance. 
JEFF Alan and Tintin? I didn't see that one coming. 
LADY PENELOPE No, you wouldn't. 
JEFF Have a safe flight home, Penny. 
LADY PENELOPE Thanks, Jeff. 
looks at him) Do you? 
ALAN Yeah, I understand. I understand you don't want me to be a Thunderbird. You don't want me to 
do anything. You won't even listen to me when I'm trying to tell you something important! 
JEFF I've heard enough. You're grounded for the rest of spring break. 
ALAN But, Dad! 
JEFF Bottom line, Alan. You need to grow up. 
ALAN Then let me. (he stalks toward the door before whispering,) Please! 
Jeff is starting at two old family photos on his desk when the video phone rings. 
JEFF Hey, John. I was just about to turn in. What can I do for you? 
JOHN TRACY I could sure use a pizza. You know a place that delivers? 
JEFF 30 minutes or it's free, right? Anything else on your mind? 
JOHN Well, got a forest fire in Vladivostok, a typhoon heading for Singapore. What's happening on 
Planet Tracy? 
JEFF Alan's home for spring break. 
JOHN Yeah, I thought I could see a storm brewing in your region. 
JEFF Teenagers. 
JOHN Well, we've all been there. And Dad, you've done a great job since Mom died. 
JEFF Thanks, John. Keep an eye on that typhoon for us. And, uh, I'll call Vladivostok, see if they need 
help with that fire. 
JOHN FAB, Dad. Sleep tight. 
Fermat is down with his father in the Thunderbirds hanger. 
FERMAT Morning, Dad. 
BRAINS Hey, son. There's something I'd like to sh-sh-sh- Here, take a look. 
FERMAT The neural-net control system? 
BRAINS It's great to have you back. I bet you didn't think spring break was going to be this w- w-fun. 
Watch this. 
Brains uses the neural-net control system to lift up the phone in front of him. It also lifts up the Mole 
which is stationed behind his workplace. 
BRAINS And that tiny phone lifts up, perfect. 
FERMAT Dad? 
switches over to Tracy Island. 
Brains and Fermat run into Jeff's office. 
BRAINS Switching to Command and Control Center. (Brains uses a palm scanner to activate Command 
and Control) 
The submarine is briefly showed getting closer to the island. 
Jeff, Scott, Virgil, and Gordon come running into Command and Control. 
JEFF How bad, Brains? 
BRAINS Thunderbird 5 major damage sustained. Possible m-m-m-Possible strike by m- 
JEFF Meteor? 
BRAINS Yep. 
JEFF Thunderbirds are go. 
Scene change to inside Thunderbird 3. 
GORDON Check retros. Go. 
JEFF Go to maximum thrust. 
Scene switches to the submarine. 
THE HOOD There goes the cavalry. But who will rescue the rescuers? 
Scene changes to Alan on the beach looking up at Thunderbird 3 launching and heading toward 
Thunderbird 5. Tintin runs up beside him and looks up as well. 
FERMAT Alan! Tintin! Thunderbird 5 has been hit! Thunderbird 5 has been hit! Thunderbird 5 has been 
hit! 
ALAN Okay, Okay, Okay, Okay, Okay don't panic. Don't panic. 
The children look toward the beach when they hear a noise and see the submarine beginning to 
surface. 
ALAN On the other hand. 
ALAN, FERMAT, TINTIN Run! 
The kids run and hide behind some trees and shrubs. Scene then switches to inside the submarine. 
MULLION We made land. 
THE HOOD (directed toward Transom) Cut them off. 
TRANSOM Activating communications blackout. 
Scene switch to Brains in Command and Control 
MULLION (Looks and door and pops his joints) I love a challenge. 
Scene changes to right outside the Tracy house as the kids are approaching the vents. 
FERMAT Watch out for the guards. 
ALAN Get in, get in. 
Scene switches to Brains sitting nervously in the Command and Control room, whistling nervously to 
himself and reading a magazine upside down. On the other side of the door there is muffled banging 
from where Mullion is trying to break open the door. 
BRAINS (Door bursts open and Mullion, Transom, and the Hood walk in) Who-o-o-o- What's going on? 
THE HOOD So, this is Mount Olympus. And these are the Thunderbirds. I should have guessed. Jeff 
Tracy, the billionaire, ex-astronaut, of course. Isn't he the one who lost his wife in an accident? 
Avalanche wasn't it? How tragic. 
Scene switches to Alan, Tintin, and Fermat walking in the vents toward the one that leads to the 
Command and Control room. 
ALAN (Whispers) Just keep going straight ahead. 
TINTIN (whispers) Okay. 
Scene switches back to Command and Control room. 
TRANSOM Professor Hackenbacker? We met at last year's international conference on 
nanotechnology. I thought your thesis on neutrinos was extremely, stimulating. 
THE HOOD Transom, concentrate! 
TRANSOM Sorry, sir. The command control switch, is here. Fingerprint recognition system. 
THE HOOD Professor. Please. Activate the control switch. 
BRAINS N-n-n-n-n- You must be kidding. 
THE HOOD Professor, you and I share an interest in the science of the mind. The difference is, I was 
born with my powers. Trust me when I tell you, you've barely touched the surface. (Brains is forced to 
stand up and walked over to the Hood) Even the strongest minds can be broken. It would be a pity to 
break yours. 
BRAINS Fu-Fu-Fu- No way! 
THE HOOD Activate the control switch, Prof! (Uses his powers to make BRAINS move) Like a puppet on 
a string! (laughs) 
Brains hand touches the activation pad. 
Bank of London. The world's monetary system will be thrown into chaos and the Thunderbirds held 
responsible. 
SCOTT You'll never get away with it. 
JEFF Why the Thunderbirds? 
THE HOOD An eye for an eye, Mr. Tracy. 
JEFF An eye for an eye? 
THE HOOD Perhaps you've forgotten me, but surely you remember saving the life of my brother, 
Kyrano? 
KYRANO Turns to the video phone that the Hood has been using to communicate with Thunderbird 
I'm sorry, Mr. Tracy. I thought he was dead. 
THE HOOD (Laughs and then turns to the guards)Take them away. 
MULLION Yes, sir. 
The kids lift their heads back up into the vents 
ALAN Whoa. 
TINTIN That makes The Hood my uncle? 
FERMAT Every family has a black sh-sh- a black sh- (Sneezes and everyone in the Command and 
Control room looks around, while Brains pretends that it was him that sneezed.) 
FERMAT (Turns to look at Alan) This room's murder with my allergies. 
The kids stick their heads back out the vent and look at what is going on in the Command and Control 
room. 
THE HOOD You left me to die that day. You may have broken my body but you've no idea how 
powerful my mind has become. And now you will suffer, as I suffered, waiting for a rescue that will 
never come. (Makes a motion for Transom to cut off the call with Thunderbird 5.) 
JEFF Wait! (Video link cuts dead and then the scene cuts to Thunderbird 5.) Scott, status report. 
SCOTT CO2 levels are rising. 
JEFF Alright, wire the oxygen scrubber to the emergency batteries. Clean the air. 
VIRGIL How long will that give us? 
JOHN About four hours. 
Scene switches back to the kids looking into the Command and Control room. Fermat begins to start 
sneezing again. Tintin and Alan put their hands over his nose and mouth to try and muffle the sound.) 
TINTIN Hey, watch it! 
FERMAT I took microbiology, not driver's ed. Set the pressure to maximum. 
TINTIN Got it. 
MULLION (The guards walk out of the elevator and see Tintin pointing the Firefly at them) Retreat! 
(They fall over and have trouble getting up due to the slipperiness of the stuff fired at them) 
TINTIN Let's move it. 
ALAN That's it. Time to thunderize. (After the door has a hole cut in it.) Yes! 
ALAN Come on, let's go! 
MULLION Get 'em! 
ALAN Where's Fermat? 
TINTIN Fermat! 
ALAN Fermat! 
FERMAT Coming! 
ALAN Hurry up. (the children are now in Thunderbird 1's silo) What were you doing back there, 
Fermat? 
FERMAT I had an-n-n idea. 
ALAN Just try and keep up, okay? I'll open the tunnel. We gotta keep moving. (Alan types in a pass 
code) 
ALAN (To Tintin and Fermat) Go back. Yell when you see them coming. (tries another pass code) 
Alan turns away from the door for a moment and the camera can see The Hood on the other side of 
the door. Alan turns back and sees him. 
THE HOOD Alan. You can run if you want. Were you surprised to hear what your father did to me? It is 
frightening when we realize our parents aren't perfect. But perhaps you already suspected that about 
your father. Why did he build these magnificent machines? Do you suppose it was guilt? Because he 
let your mother die. (Alan shakes his head no) Open the door, Alan. (Alan continues to shake his head 
no) (The Hood chuckles at his refusal) Open, the, door. (He tries to use his powers on Alan but nothing 
happens) 
ALAN (Shouting to Tintin and Fermat) We can't go this way. He's there. 
The Hood uses his powers to open the door and Mullion and the other guards appear at the other 
doorway, leaving the children trapped. 
TINTIN Boo! 
ALAN No, c'mon Tintin, stay there. 
TINTIN You're worse than a couple of girls. Hurry up and get dressed. (To Fermat) Those are nice 
drawers! 
Scene switches to the children walking along one of the beaches. 
FERMAT Data from Tracy Island is sent to Thunderbird 5 via satellite, right? 
ALAN Right. 
FERMAT So, there's a miniscule possibility that if we reach the satellite station, we could 
ALAN Blow it up! 
FERMAT No, we could hack in to it and give control back to Thunderbird 5. 
ALAN Good thinking, Fermat. Alright, let's do it. (Alan starts drawing the plan in the sand) Here's the 
plan. We're here, right?. So, we go along the shore around the base of the mountain to the access road, 
here. And then up to the transmitter. So what do you think? 
TINTIN Good. Except that we're here, not there, and the transmitter is there, not here. We have to go 
through the jungle. 
FERMAT But that's f-f- off limits. 
TINTIN It's gonna be dangerous. 
ALAN I'm in. (All three of them put their hands together) We gotta get up there fast! All our folks are 
in trouble and if The Hood gets off the island 
FERMAT Actually, he's not going anywhere for now. 
ALAN The guidance processor for Thunderbird 2. You can't take off without it. Fermat you're a genius. 
How'd you get this? 
FERMAT Alan, my friend, what you don't know, can't hurt you. 
Scene switches to Lady Penelope's Country Mansion in England, where Parker is out cleaning a car 
when the car phone rings. 
LADY PENELOPE Parker? 
PARKER Milady? 
LADY PENELOPE We have an emergency. 
Scene switch to Lady Penelope's bathroom 
LADY PENELOPE What a charming fellow. 
FERMAT You think? 
ALAN Must run in the family. Did you do that? 
TINTIN Just drop it, okay? 
ALAN Still think everything can be explained by science? 
FERMAT Not girls! 
Scene cuts to Thunderbird 5 where there is an alarm and then an explosion near Scott and Gordon. 
JEFF Scott? Gordon? You all right? 
GORDON We're okay. 
SCOTT The heat exchanger has blown. 
JEFF You don't say. 
Scene switches back to Mullion and two other guards searching the jungle for Alan, Tintin, and 
Fermat. 
MULLION Come on! Those brats are in here somewhere. 
Scene change to the kids at the satellite transmitter. 
ALAN How we doing Fermat? 
FERMAT Don't rush me Alan. This is very d-delicate equipment. (The circuit board sparks.) Which is 
now b-b-broken. 
ALAN Can you fix it? 
FERMAT Yea- Maybe, but I'll need something to solder with. 
ALAN We're in the middle of nowhere Fermat, where are you going to find something like that. (Tintin 
and Fermat see Alan's retainer and share a look) What? 
Alan yells as Tintin and Fermat pull out the metal part of Alan's retainer. 
ALAN Ow! 
FERMAT Perfect. 
TINTIN Gee Alan, I never figured you for a crybaby. 
ALAN I'm gonna kill you. 
FERMAT What'd he say? 
TINTIN I think it was some sort of apology. 
FERMAT I got it, yes! Y-y-you the man, Fermat! Okay, first step is to establish contact with Thunderbird 
Scene switch to Thunderbird 5 
ALAN Dad! 
Alan throws the video phone 
FERMAT No! 
ALAN Useless! 
FERMAT It is now. 
TINTIN I'm sorry, Alan. This is hard on all of us. 
ALAN No, it's okay. I'm fine. 
FERMAT You don't have to be such a tough guy Alan. I'm worried about my dad too. 
TINTIN I'd do anything to be with my parents right now. 
ALAN But The Hood knows we're alive now. We have to go. 
FERMAT Even worse, they know exactly 
Tires screech and Mullion and the guards appear. 
FERMAT Where we are! 
Mullion and the other guards watch the kids running down the hillside for a second. 
MULLION Come on! 
The kids fall down a ditch screaming and into a river. 
FERMAT Great, more water. 
ALAN Tintin, can you slow 'em down? 
TINTIN I'd be delighted. 
ALAN Then do it. And meet us at the junk yard. Come on, Fermat. 
Scene changes to Alan and Fermat discovering a hoversled in the junkyard. 
ALAN This'll get us out of here. 
Scene change to Mullion hunting Tintin down in the forest. 
MULLION There! Come on! 
Tintin looks up and sees a bees hive. 
MULLION Straight ahead. 
Tintin uses a limb to hit the bee hive at Mullion and the other two guards. Mullion falls off the car 
and into a puddle while being stung by bees. The scene cuts back to Alan and Fermat in the junkyard 
attaching something to the back of the hoversled so that all three of them can fit on it. 
FERMAT It's gonna make this thing hard to control you know. 
TINTIN I'm fine, Dad. 
MULLION (Grabs Fermat away from Brains and has him sit down on a container) Cool off, kid! (he 
laughs evilly as he walks out of the fridge and closes the door on the way out) 
Scene switch to Park and Lady Penelope approaching Tracy Island. 
PARKER Tracy Island approaching, milady. Switching to aqua mode. 
LADY PENELOPE Isn't life fun, sometimes? 
PARKER Rib-tickling, milady. 
Scene switches to Transom and The Hood in Command and Control getting an alarm that an aircraft is 
approaching Tracy Island. 
THE HOOD What is it? 
TRANSOM We have an unidentified craft approaching the island at high speed. 
Scene switches to Alan climbing over a hill and seeing Lady Penelope's car approaching. 
ALAN Lady P! 
Scene switches to Thunderbird 5 
JEFF Phew! Somebody roll down a window. It's getting a little hot in here. 
VIRGIL Re-entry into Earth's atmosphere in 37 minutes. 
SCOTT Oxygen's out in 30 so we won't feel it. 
JEFF Stop it! 
GORDON Come on, Dad. The situation's hopeless. 
JEFF No, it's not. There's still time. We've got people on the ground working for us. 
GORDON Alan? He's just a kid! 
JEFF He's a Tracy. 
Scene switches quickly to Alan running through the forest and then to Lady Penelope and Parker 
walking up to the Tracy house 
LADY PENELOPE This doesn't look good, Parker. 
PARKER No, milady. 
LADY PENELOPE That bougainvillea is absolutely parched, and someone should do something about 
that hideous hammock. 
THE HOOD (After seeing Lady Penelope and Parker) Whom do we have here? Mullion. 
MULLION I must warn you that I know judo, krai magna, and tae kwon do. 
THE HOOD (with his back still to Alan) How are you, Alan? (he uses his powers on Parker and Lady 
Penelope and they cry out in pain) (Alan moves to run back into the jungle) I hope you don't think I'm 
going to chase you. (he uses his powers on Parker and Lady Penelope and they cry out in pain again) 
You can make it stop, Alan. (Parker and Lady Penelope cry out again) You have something that belongs 
to me. 
PARKER Really, sir, don't mind me. This isn't the first time my head's been pulverized. And it's never 
done any real harm before. (The Hood once again uses his powers on them and they cry out in pain 
louder this time) 
ALAN (comes out of his hiding place) Stop! Stop! I'll give it to you. (throws the guidance processor 
toward the pool) Fetch! (the Hood uses his powers to bring it over to him before it can hit the water) 
THE HOOD You made a match of it, Alan, I'll give you that. (to Mullion and Transom) Put them with the 
others. (Transom grabs Parker) 
MULLION (To Lady Penelope and Alan) You're coming with me. (Grabs Alan's arms and throws Lady 
Penelope over his shoulder) 
LADY PENELOPE Put me down! This outfit is couture. 
Scene switches to Thunderbird 5. 
JEFF Don't go to sleep. John, look at me. Keep your eyes open. 
Scene switches back to the fridge where Mullion and Transom are taking Alan, Lady Penelope, and 
Parker. 
MULLION You need to cool off, milady. 
TINTIN Lady Penelope! 
LADY PENELOPE (To Mullion) Big oaf! (The fridge door closes leaving them trapped) Right, that's quite 
enough losing for one day. 
ALAN (To Fermat) So, how does it feel to be right all the time? 
FERMAT Not b-bad, actually. 
ALAN I'm so sorry, Fermat. 
FERMAT We make quite a pair. It's hard for me to t-t-talk. It's hard for you to l-l-listen. 
LADY PENELOPE Parker, I have an idea. 
PARKER Excellent, milady. 
LADY PENELOPE Brains, how long do Jeff and the boys have? 
BRAINS Thunderbird 1 come in. 
ALAN Roger, Brains. 
BRAINS Situation update, Thunderbird 3 is about to initiate separation. 
ALAN AND FERMAT FAB. 
LADY PENELOPE Boys, Thunderbird 2 is in final approach to London. 
ALAN I know The Hood's weakness, Fermat. I can stop him if we get there in time. 
FERMAT Stand by. We're going to maximum thrust. 
ALL Whoaaaa! 
Scene switches to Thunderbird 3 separating from Thunderbird 5 
JEFF Gordon, heat 'em up. 
Thunderbird 2 lands in a park near the London Eye and causes panic. 
CHUCK We're getting reports of some kind of incident in London involving the Thunderbirds. Lisa, are 
you there? 
LISA LOWE Chuck, I'm here in Jubilee Gardens where Thunderbird 2 has made an impromptu landing, 
causing total panic in Central London. As far as we know there has been no emergency call from this 
area so it's unclear why Thunderbird 2 would be active here at all. I don't know if you can see this Chuck 
but Thunderbird 2 seems to be unloading some kind of machine. 
Scene changes to inside the Mole with Transom, Mullion, and The Hood. 
THE HOOD Set a course for the vault. 
TRANSOM Sir, if we continue on our present course, we'll sever the monorail's subterranean supports. 
Shall I correct our position? 
THE HOOD Stay on course. 
TRANSOM But sir, we'll cause a major disaster. 
THE HOOD No, we won't. The Thunderbirds will. 
The Mole severs the subterranean support leaving one monorail car stranded in the air. Scene then 
switches to Thunderbird 1 
LADY PENELOPE Let's get her down, boys. 
ALAN Initiate landing, Fermat. 
FERMAT Right. 
ALAN Retros at 75 flaps to 16. 
BRAINS It's on the ground. The k-k-kids are in Thunderbird 2. 
JEFF FAB. We're right behind 'em. 
Scene changes to Mullion, Transom, and the Hood in the Bank of London. 
MULLION Look at all this gold! 
THE HOOD Stay focused, Mullion. Nine more banks to go. 
Scene changes to Alan in Thunderbird 4. 
ALAN Fermat, deploying Thunderbird 4 in three, two, one, Thunderbird 4 is go. I can see the monorail. 
People are panicking in the monorail and a little girl is crying for her mommy. 
ALAN Don't panic, guys. 
ALAN Fermat, I'll hold the monorail in place. Can you get a line on that stanchion and lift it up? 
FERMAT I can't get a clear fix on the target. I might hit the passengers. 
TINTIN I'll go and fix it myself. 
FERMAT What you mean swim?! 
TINTIN Get me as close as you can. 
ALAN How are we doing on that line Fermat? 
FERMAT Just look out your window. 
FERMAT Come on, Tintin, come on! 
ALAN Come on. Come on, Tintin. You can do this. (Tintin successfully connects the rope to the 
stanchion and swims toward Thunderbird 4's airlock) Opening the airlock. 
ALAN OK, Fermat, we need a lift. 
FERMAT FAB, Alan. Commencing reverse thrust. 
ALAN That was amazing, Tintin. 
TINTIN Thank you. 
ALAN Nice job, Fermat. 
FERMAT Nothing to it, really. 
ALAN (To Tintin who is helping him lift the monorail out of the water with Thunderbird 4) Easy does it. 
Thunderbird 3 has landed and Jeff, Scott, John, Virgil, and Gordon are running over to the river bank 
to look for Alan in Thunderbird 4. 
SCOTT There they are! (Everyone cheers) 
ALAN (After he and Tintin have gotten out of Thunderbird 4) Glad you could finally join us. 
PARKER My pleasure, Mr. Tracy. 
Scene switches to The Hood talking to Mullion and Transom. 
THE HOOD The Thunderbirds. They're here. Kill them all. 
Scene switches to Jeff, Alan, Parker, Tintin, and Fermat inside the Bank of London. 
JEFF Alan, you guys stay here with Parker. I'm gonna go find Lady Penelope. 
ALAN But what about The Hood? (Alan points behind Parker) Look out, Parker! (When Parker turns 
away Alan runs after his dad.) 
PARKER Master Tracy! 
FERMAT Look out, Parker! 
PARKER Alright, that's enough of that. 
MULLION (from behind Parker) Don't move. (Parker motions for the kids to run forward but Transom 
blocks them. Parker puts his hands up as if to punch her) 
TRANSOM Go on, then. 
PARKER No, sorry. I can't hit a lady. 
TINTIN Allow me. (she kick Transom and runs off, Transom chases her) 
MULLION (To Fermat) I've been waiting to get my hands on you brats. 
PARKER And I've been waiting to get my hands on you. 
They brawl for a few seconds before Mullion lands a good punch on Parker. 
PARKER Ow, now that was a punch. 
FERMAT Parker, can we wrap this up? 
PARKER What did you have in mind, Master Hackenbacker? 
FERMAT Strategically speaking, the best odds of success lie with the Parker Haymaker. 
PARKER I concur. (they knock Mullion out) 
Scene changes to Jeff running into the room that Lady Penelope is being held captive in 
JEFF Penny! 
PENNY Jeff, no! 
THE HOOD Did you save them all this time, Jeff? Or did you leave someone behind? 
JEFF I didn't make you what you are. 
THE HOOD It's not me you have to convince. (motions his head toward the entrance of the room 
where Alan is standing)

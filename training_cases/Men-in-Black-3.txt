CLOSE ON A PAIR OF MIRROR AVIATOR SUNGLASSES 
Standard issue throughout the south to abusive, racist prison guards. 
Widen to reveal that, indeed, these glasses are on the sneering face of just such a man. We follow the guard 
DOWN A DINGY PRISON HALLWAY 
Paint peeling off the rusty bars. Somewhere, someone is playing harmonica. Prisoners yell complaints as he passes. He meets them all with-- 
GUARD Shut up, convict! Get yer hands off the bars! 
The guard passes through several levels of security doors, deeper and deeper into the more secure bowels of the prison -- home of the scum of the scum. Meanwhile... 
PRISON VISITING ROOM 
The lazy-ass guards in charge of screening visitors read magazines, watch TV. Footsteps -- someone's here. Which pisses them off, because that means they actually have to do their jobs. 
The unseen visitor buzzes for help. They take their time getting off their asses. When they finally look up, their gaze becomes a leer. Follow it to: DEVIL GIRL, the visitor. Too tall, too muscled, but hot if you're into that kind of thing -- an R. Crumb drawing come to life. 
She holds a CAKE -- the cutest, perfectly-frosted pink cake right off the cover of the Betty Crocker cookbook. 
GUARD 2 Lookie here. Yaz's visitor. I guess even a turd gets flies to land on it. 
GUARD 3 Me, I like a big girl. 
They smirk, hoping for a reaction. Devil girl emits a low, sinister growl like an angry Doberman... The guards look at each other and GET DOWN TO BUSINESS: 
GUARD 2 I.D., visitation papers. 
BACK DOWN THE HALLWAY WITH THE GUARD He reaches the end of the hallway. The biggest, most absurdly-reinforced double security door. He punches in a code. The giant door retracts -- its immense weight has it squeaking and groaning the whole way. Whoever's behind this thing must've done something REAL bad. 
WITH DEVIL GIRL Going through the metal detectors, waved over with security wands. The guards are being thorough. Maybe more thorough than they need to be. They check everything -- even the cake. The digital readout tells them NO METAL DETECTED. 
GUARD 3 She's clean. Well, not CLEAN, but you know. They laugh, buzz her through. 
WITH THE GUARD The giant door finally opens, he continues to the end of the hallway. Stops in front of a cell. Yells in: 
GUARD Hey, Yaz! You got a visitor. Let's go, pretty boy. 
VISITING ROOM Spare. Just a table and chairs in the middle -- poured concrete. Nothing a convict could, say, smash into the face of a guard. The perimeter of the room is lined with armed guards -- looks like they're not taking chances. 
At the lone table -- Devil Girl waits with her cake. She hears the door open -- her face lights up as IN STEPS HER 
BELOVED -- YAZ, an evil hippie/biker badass right out of Easy Rider. A huge mane of hair, a big handlebar moustache that frames a grubby unshaven face... Everything about him seems strangely independently alive -- every strand of hair, every fringe on his dirty jacket -- the way Elvis was in his prime. He wears a distinctive SKULL PINKIE RING. A smirk plays on his mouth that says -- I'm smarter than you, asshole. The guards escort Yaz, who can barely walk in his CHAINS and MANACLES. They dump him into one of the chairs. Devil Girl jumps up, they lock in a kiss -- it goes on too long. A guard pokes them with his billy club -- 
GUARD 2 This ain't a conjugal visit. quit yer conjugating. 
ON YAZ As he and Devil girl step through the hole, take a deep, satisfied breath of FREEDOM. Reveal we are on... 
THE SURFACE OF THE MOON The signage on the prison reads INTERGALACTIC DEPARTMENT OF 
CORRECTIONS, LUNAR DIVISION Yaz looks up at the BLUE MARBLE OF EARTH, smiles. As Yaz fixes his gaze on our planet, his hair, his fringes INDEPENDENTLY ARTICULATE YAZ'S MALEVOLENT EMOTIONS... they also seem drawn here. Like bees, they express a collective intelligence. 
YAZ I'm coming for you... Following Yaz's gaze to the Earth, we launch into... 
CREDITS MiB credits fly us through the Galaxy. Ending on a PARTICULARLY INHOSPITABLE LOOKING PLANET As it revolves, we observe its strange craters and surface, where steaming fissures belch geysers of noxious gases... 
KAY'S VOICE (V.0.) When you really think about it, the universe is a pretty awful place. Full of danger, brutality, and ten million kinds of scum. So the trick is to find one or two things that make life in this cesspool worth living. And reveal we are actually looking at... 
PEKING DUCK Rotating on a spit. JAY and KAY watch this awful duck rotate. 
JAY That? That nasty, greasy thing makes your life worth living? There's people eating here, younger than that duck. 
KAY I was talking about the noodles. Best noodles in town. And we are in 
INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - CHINATOWN, NYC - NIGHT 
Tanks everywhere filled with strange fish. An eclectic NY crowd eats -- Wall Street guys, hipsters, a Chinese family or two, a couple of NYU professor types who love the "authenticity" of this place. KAY flashes a badge to the OWNER, Chinese. 
KAY Good evening, Mr. Wu. 
MR. WU (heavily accented, barely 
INTELLIGIBLE) Kay, Jay... So happy see you... Mr. Wu get you regular table... 
KAY Not so fast, Wu. We'd like to take a look in the tanks. 
MR. WU Yes, you see, very fresh. 
JAY The tanks in the back, Wu. 
MR. WU Oh... so sorry... please no English, you come back later... 
JAY Hey, save the chop socky bullshit for the locals, Wu. We need to see the kitchen. 
MR. WU 
(PERFECT ENGLISH) Why are you busting my balls, Jay? 
KAY (O.S.) Jay, take a look at this. Wu protests, Jay blows by him. 
THE KITCHEN 
KAY So this is what you're passing off as tuna? Reveal a giant tank holding a HUGE ALIEN FISH. 
JAY Wow, I didn't think there was anything uglier than a catfish. Jay taps on the glass -- the fish SNARLS, making Jay JUMP. 
KAY Ugly AND a clear violation of Health ordinance 32, selling 
UNLICENSED EXTRATERRESTRIAL foodstuffs. 
YAZ This time you don't have your friends to tell you what happens next. 
KAY Oh, I know what happens next. 
Kay draws his EQUALLY BADASS-LOOKING WEAPON -- 
KAY (CONT'D) I've been waiting forty years for another shot at you, scum. Kay takes aim and... CLICK! Empty. 
GUN (V.0.) Your weapon is empty! Please recharge! 
KAY Damn! 
GUN (V.0.) Sorry you're having trouble! If you survive this encounter, please call customer service at-- Kay throws the gun at Yaz. Yaz laughs. Gets Kay in his sights. 
YAZ All I wanted was justice, Kay. Justice for my brothers. But you had to meddle, didn't you? 
KAY They deserved what they got. 
YAZ Why don't you say that to their faces when you see them... Puts the barrel in Kay's face and BOOM!!! Yaz goes up in a GIANT EXPLOSION!! Reveal Jay, just fired the shot. Jay looks like total hell, beaten up, covered with 8 kinds of slime and alien guts. He stumbles over to Kay, who in contrast looks perfectly pressed. 
JAY So I was thinking about making a chart for each time I save your ass. And when I do it ten times, you buy me lunch. 
Kay lets out a long, weary sigh. 
KAY Will you settle for a drink? 
INT. DESTROYED CHINESE RESTAURANT 
Kay reaches behind the counter for a couple of beers. Jay is on his phone. 
JAY 
(INTO PHONE) We're gonna need a cleanup on the corner of Canal and Mott. And bring a net. Biggest one you've got. Follow Jay's gaze -- the giant fish flops its way down Canal. Jay and Kay back in their booth, Jay grabs a couple noodles off another table and starts eating. Through the scene, various MiB clean-up crew people work the crime scene. 
JAY (CONT'D) 
(MOUTH FULL) Why aren't you eating? 
(GETS NOTHING) So what the hell was that guy? Kay's quiet. Ominously quiet. Weighing his words: 
KAY Yaz. Put him away a long time ago. Biggest mistake I ever made. 
JAY Why? Was he the wrong guy? 
KAY No. Should've killed him. 
JAY Yeah, well, don't worry, I think I took care of him. 
KAY That was too easy. 
JAY I make it look easy. That's the problem with being my partner. 
(MORE) 
CASUALTY... HUMAN DEAD AT THE SCENE... 
ZED (O.S.) Ready to bring the pain? Reveal Zed in his ridiculous bowling outfit. 
BOWLING ALLEY - LATER THAT NIGHT A sign says: CLOSED FOR LEAGUE NIGHT We follow a couple normal-looking BOWLERS into 
INT. BOWLING ALLEY 
Safely inside, the Bowlers remove their heads -- which become their bowling balls. It's the LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIP GAME -- ALIENS VS. MIB AGENTS MiB agents and aliens say hi, exchange trash-talk. We see shots of games in progress: An alien rolls a ball -- when it gets to the end of the lane, it sticks out arms, taking down all the pins. 
The aliens cheer, slap tentacles, clink beers and swallow them whole. A many-armed alien re-sets the pins. A giant alien with perfect dainty form approaches the foul line... and -- gutter ball! He gets mad and shoots the pins with his laser-eyes. We end up with JAY AND THE MIB TEAM, NOT BOWLING BECAUSE 
THEY'RE WAITING FOR KAY -- Zed paces, wearing way too much bowling regalia. 
ZED Where's Kay? We either roll or forfeit -- and I didn't put this on to forfeit! 
JAY Alright, Bowling Robot, do what we built you for. Reveal an incredibly high-tech robot wearing one of those white trash T-shirts that reads "10 reasons why Bowling is better than Women." 
ROBOT 
(ROBOT VOICE) This is my time to shine. Robot fires a ball directly down into the floor. An awkward beat as we hear the ball puncture four floors. Then a car alarm. 
ROBOT (CONT'D) There goes my perfect game. 
(ROBOT LAUGH) Ha ha ha. 
JAY Guess it's on me. Jay rolls -- perfect spin -- Jay watches, willing it towards the pins -- which SCRAMBLE OUT OF THE WAY! But Jay's roll is too good -- it spins from fleeing pin to fleeing pin -- a 
STRIKE! Jay and his teammates triumphant! The frame of a lifetime! Jay looks around -- 
JAY (CONT'D) Of course -- the one time Kay isn't here... 
MIB HQ - TUNNEL VENT ROOM Jay enters -- looks a little worse for wear, like somebody who did some celebrating last night. We see why -- when he hoists his GIANT, RIDICULOUS MIB 
BOWLING TROPHY. 
JAY Check it out-- The trophy raises a triumphant fist -- we realize it is in fact AN ALIEN. 
TROPHY We're number one! In your face! Suck it! 
JAY Look who's league MVP. 
GUARD Big surprise, you win every year. That's weird... 
JAY I... huh? 
MIB HQ - HEADQUARTERS Jay, in a good mood, flaunts his trophy to everyone in the office. The trophy continues its stream of obnoxious trash talk. 
JAY Where are you, Kay? I think you want to see this. It's the bowling MVP trophy with MY name on it. Jay works his way to his desk. Kay's already at his own adjacent desk -- bent over his work, his back to Jay. 
JAY (CONT'D) Maybe you want to think twice next time you ditch me. Kay, absorbed in work, doesn't answer. 
JAY (CONT'D) Kay? 
TREVOR Everyone thinks their computer problem is the world coming to an end. 
JAY Right. Take a look at this. Jay directs Cera's sightline to the sky-- 
TREVOR Ahhh! What is THAT? 
JAY That, is We're all dead in... Seven 
MINUTES UNLESS--- 
TREVOR Unless WHAT?? 
JAY You start sharing the illegal time travel tech you've been slinging. 
NERD Excuse me, can you tell me which one of these batteries is better? The 10-hour or the 12-- 
JAY You only need seven minutes, get the cheap one. He grabs Trevor- 
JAY (CONT'D) Where is it?? 
TREVOR Okay, okay, I'll show you. But this is incredibly powerful technology, so it must remain absolutely secret. Follow me. Trevor LEAVES HIS POST --- Jay follows: 
TREVOR (CONT'D) Absolutely secret, do you understand? 
JAY Yes, but we're running out of time-- 
AFFLUENT WESTSIDE MOM Hey! Excuse me! 
TREVOR With you in a second, ma'am. 
AFFLUENT WESTSIDE MOM It'll only take a minute. You see, my nanny's phone number got erased from my favorites and I have to ask her what my daughter wants for her birthday. Jay takes the phone. 
JAY Oh, I see the problem. He CHUCKS THE PHONE across the store, where it SMASHES TO PIECES. She leaves in a huff. 
TREVOR I've always wanted to do that. okay, so here's what you do... Trevor pulls Jay in, ready to lay this top secret information on him... 
TREVOR (CONT'D) Okay, so go to the clock app. And shake it. 
JAY That's it? Jay does it. 
On the phone -- TIME TRAVEL BETA 
TREVOR Now you just type in the year you want to travel to... On the phone -- it's "augmented reality" -- the image through the phone is the image of the targeted time period. 
JAY Okay, thanks. 
TREVOR Now listen. This is highly crucial: Time travel is nothing to mess with. You can't change anything, you can't use new technology or all of space-time can just -- kablooey! 
JAY 
(OFF MISSILES) Yeah, well, is it ok if I change 
THAT? 
SINGING ALONG AT FULL BLAST. At a light, he pulls even with an older Brooklyn Italian couple. They give him a disapproving look. The woman clutches her pearls just a little more protectively. He smiles and leans towards them. 
JAY Guess what? Black president! He laughs and drives off. Pulls up at... 
EXT. MIB HQ ENTRANCE/VENTILATION BUILDING 
The secret entrance to MiB HQ, familiar from the first movie. Jay strides up to the entrance and... can't open the door. Bangs on the door -- nothing. Shaking the knob, calling to the guard... nothing. From behind him: 
VOICE (O.S.) Help you? Look a little lost. 
JAY Yeah, thanks, listen-- 
Jay turns and is face-to-face with two grinning Staten Island cops. He instantly realizes what's about to go down. 
JAY (CONT'D) 
(SIGHS) Yeah, guess I knew this wasn't gonna be just people handing me money and Cadillacs. 
COP 1 'Scuse me? 
JAY Nothing, officer. I'll be on my way. 
COP 2 That's an awful nice car. 
JAY Thanks. 
COP 1 Kind of work you do, individual of your particular... ethnic persuasion... to buy a car like that? 
COP 2 Wouldn't be anything illegal, would it? 
COP 1 You an athlete or something? 
JAY Yeah, I'm the North American champion of kiss my ass. The cop loses his smile, turns to his partner: 
COP 1 That sound like resisting arrest to you? 
COP 2 Sure did. They grab him, start to frisk him -- 
COP 2 (CONT'D) Well, well. Boy, you're gonna have a little problem explaining THIS. 
The cop holds up Jay's HIGH-TECH GUN -- the NOISY CRICKET and his NEURALIZER. A BLACK CROWN VIC SCREECHES UP between the cops and JAY. Out steps KAY -- but 40+ years younger. 
KAY (flashes a badge) I'll take it from here. 
COP Who the hell are you? 
KAY Agent Kay, Division 2, special... (gives Jay a look) .black ops. Thank you for your cooperation, if I could ask you to look here for a moment -- Kay pulls out what looks like a NEURALIZER -- and swiftly beats each one over the head -- it's just a BLACKJACK -- they crumple. 
JAY Kay? Kay, is that you? Oh, man it's good to see you, buddy! Jay hugs Kay -- who remains stony-faced. Jay gets a little choked up to see his friend alive -- Kay is a rock. 
JAY (CONT'D) Look at you, all... sort-of- young... Kay! 
KAY That's got to be the first time an unregistered alien caught sneaking onto Earth was happy to see me. Jay pulls away, realizing-- 
Jay looks at the date: July 14, 1969. 
JAY (CONT'D) The fourteenth. Then we have two days. Kay really takes his time, picking out the right sandwich. 
JAY (CONT'D) Hey, look, I know your lunch is important, but like I said, we only have two days here. 
KAY Here we go... Kay puts some money in the machine -- is about to make his selection. Jay reacts to it -- GROSS! We see -- the most unappealing ham sandwich ever. The meat is tinged with green and beginning to get a little fuzzy. No one in their right mind would buy this sandwich. 
JAY No way, man. I am not letting you eat that. I didn't come all the way here to have you die before I can tell you-- Kay reaches for the button. Jay slaps his hand away. A BEAT of undignified hand-slap-fighting-- 
JAY (CONT'D) No way, man. No way the world ends because you had to eat that thing-- Kay SUCCEEDS IN HITTING THE BUTTON and 
FWOOOOOOPI A SECRET DOOR instantly spins them around and Jay and Kay are 
INT. MIB 1969 HQ 
A cloud of smoke... It clears and reveals Mid-century futurism with a martini lunch office vibe. It's how Isaac Asimov and Ray Bradbury would have imagined the MiB offices. 
The cloud of smoke comes from everyone smoking. Aliens run around with ashtrays, cocktail shakers and cigarettes. The alien smokers smoke from surprising orifices. The !liB agents have the feel of ivy league privilege. Very male and very white. Women are there to be secretaries and eye candy. Two many-armed aliens stock the automat. Kay tosses one the sandwich, it goes right back into the automat. Jay recognizes the aliens -- it's the twins! 
JAY Hey! [long alien name] and Bob! Don't worry, you guys get a big promotion in, like, 20 years. Kay takes Jay down an escalator. Quick atmospheric establishing shots of MiB '69: - A wall of Black and White TVs monitoring the aliens of the times: Castro... Yoko... Hendrix... - A cluster of agents use a joystick to manipulate a very high-tech camera. Reveal they're using it to watch a secretary's ass. She gets wise, turns -- they raise their martinis and she giggles at them: You're incorrigible! - Aliens work switchboards, work in the steno pool. - Someone barks at an alien to grab a couple Mooners and go clean something up. - An MiB barbershop quartet practices. 
MIB QUARTET 
(SINGING) The men in blaaaaaaack... Jay can't help laughing -- 
JAY What planet are they from? 
KAY The Hamptons. Let's go somewhere we can talk. 
JAY Finally. 
INT. HOLDING ROOM 
Typical interrogation room table in the middle. Kay pulls out a giant form -- it looks like 10 tax returns stacked together. He fits sheets of carbon between the pages. 
JAY Oh, we're gonna do the forms now. Listen, Kay, I know you're gonna do what you're gonna do, but we're burning time here. When I got here, you had 48 hours. Now you've got 46. 
KAY Name, planet of origin and Galactic 
ID NUMBER-- 
JAY My name is Agent Jay, you gave it to me. 
KAY 
(WRITING) "Subject uncooperative." Purpose of visit? 
JAY To save the Earth. Kay looks at the form, there's a number of options to check: "Create a new race... Steal Earth women... Offer life of eternal youth... vacation... Save the Earth." He checks the box. 
KAY Save the Earth... Congratulations, you're the third one today... Maybe you'll get a balloon. 
JAY Fine, don't believe me. But just listen to what I have to say, because it's going to save your life and the life of everyone in this galaxy. It hangs in the air... 
KAY Have a lay down, stretch. The orderlies force Jay on a sort of gurney -- in the '69 Neuralizer, the "patient" is fed through the machine, like for an MRI. 
JAY You erase what's in here, you erase the whole world. 
KAY Don't worry. When it's over, you'll forget all about this Yaz and Florida and the end of the world. I think it'll be good for you. Calm you down. 
JAY I don't need to calm down. 
KAY Don't worry, it's safe. We even tested it on one of our own men. Kay indicates Q, who wanders around like he's been lobotomized. 
KAY (CONT'D) Hey, Agent Q! Q waves back: 
Q Hey, agent Q! 
KAY No, YOU'RE -- forget it. (back to Jay) We're still.., fine-tuning it. okay, strap him down. TWO BIG-ASS ALIEN ORDERLIES force Jay down. A TECH flips the machine ON -- TUBES POWER UP WITH HUGE NOISE 
AND FANFARE. Jay struggles as he gets closer and closer to the machine. Jay manages to slide his key fob out of his'pocket -- uses the edge to flip open the clamp on the straps -- and HE'S 
FREE 
TECH How the hell-- Kay smiles -- Not bad, kid. The orderlies rush him -- Jay knocks them out. The scientists are fraidy-cats -- they hide. It's down to Jay and Kay. 
KAY Nice moves. You'd make a good agent. 
JAY I AM a good agent! Kay takes a SWING at Jay -- Jay dodges it easily. 
JAY (CONT'D) That's right, you always lead with your left. 
Kay pulls his weapon -- Jay ducks behind the Neuralizer -- now Kay can't shoot. 
KAY You're just making it worse for yourself. The following plays over a game of CAT AND MOUSE around the giant structure of the Neuralizer -- like through the stacks in a library. 
KAY (CONT'D) There's nowhere to run, slim. It's just if we're gonna do it easy or do it hard. Jay runs into a dead end. Kay and the orderlies are on him. The pissed-off orderlies grab him roughly, force him onto the gurney. Jay keeps flailing. 
JAY I know you, Kay, I can prove it... 
(SEARCHES) You love to bowl! 
KAY Bowling is enjoyed by more than 95 million people in more than 90 countries. You gotta do better than that. 
JAY You've got a scar on the back of your right hand! Jay grabs Kay's hand. They LOCK EYES for a moment. Kay lets Jay flip his hand over, big build-up, REVEALING... .no scar. 
JAY (CONT'D) Damn. You will! I swear! Kay signals -- the Neuralizer powers up. And Jay is on the conveyor belt into the machine. This is all about to be over. Jay thinks desperately for a way out, THEN-- Eureka!! 
JAY (CONT'D) Kay! KAY!!! What about your girl on Martha's Vineyard? 
Kay looks up. Jay sees an opening: 
JAY (CONT'D) You chose the job over her -- but you never stopped thinking about her. You can't forget her. Kay grabs him. 
KAY How the hell do you know that? I've never told anyone that. A long look at this guy, who somehow knows things he shouldn't. And he hits the POWER OFF BUTTON... But this being TUBE TECHNOLOGY -- we stay with JAY'S TERRIFYING POV -- as he slides through the claustrophobic Neuralizer chamber -- the tubes powering down just in time, inches away from him. Jay crawls out of the Neuralizer, shaken. 
JAY You see, Kay? It's me-- But Kay grabs him and puts a gun on him-- 
VIDAL Stop, you bastard! 
PRELL I'm telling you, we don't know anything! 
KAY You wanna play tough? How about we take a ride to the barber college, see how tough you are? Kay keeps shaking them down, but Jay is distracted... On Jay... something is making him think... A sound... it. grows louder... we start to be able to make out the distinct bip... bip... bip... of PONG Jay FOLLOWS THE SOUND... To a group of people -- that incredible Factory mix from slumming socialites to Black Panthers to the freakiest freaks... They surround a SKANKY GUY -- and whatever they're watching on TV is so mesmerizing it's like they're seeing the face of God... 
BROOKE ASTOR It's too beautiful. Someone takes a picture of the screen. Jay walks around the TV -- REVEAL: They're watching CLASSIC EARLY 70S PONG. 
The SKANKY GUY controls it via a BIG MEDALLION hooked up to the TV antennae terminals. He's playing against a young clean-cut square. Jay grabs the wires and rips them out, cutting off the game. Everyone JEERS him. ON KAY, hearing the noise, turns to see what's going on. 
SKANKY GUY What the hell, man? 
JAY Just wondering where you got that. 
SKANKY GUY Your mother. The crowd laughs. 
JAY Really. So my mother gave you a technology that hasn't been 
INVENTED FOR SEVEN YEARS? Jay grabs him by the throat. Partygoers react. Someone takes pictures. Someone claps in delight. 
JAY (CONT'D) Now how about you tell me where you really got it? The skanky guy knows he's in trouble. 
SKANKY GUY Oh... uh... okay, no hassles, man... I got it from that dude over there... With the beard. Jay turns, lets go just long enough for the guy to LEAP OUT 
THE WINDOW Jay takes off after him -- Kay joins And the CHASE IS ON 
CHASE THROUGH THE VILLAGE Jay and Kay chase the guy through various 60s locations - a commune, an ashram, a folk club, a protest. 
Everywhere they are mistaken for "pigs" - people get in their way. To Jay's surprise, young Kay is a hell of a runner, in incredible shape. It gets competitive between them... Until Jay can't keep up -- Kay takes off... Kay runs the Skanky Guy down - Jay huffs and puffs his way over, grabs the medallion. 
JAY Alright, one more time. Where'd you get this? 
SKANKY GUY It was a gift-- 
JAY Bullshit. Kay puts a gun on him. 
JAY (CONT'D) Oh, hey. This is my partner. He's about to get fired for excessive violence and he doesn't have much left to lose. 
SKANKY GUY I borrowed it! CLICK! Kay cocks the gun. 
SKANKY GUY (CONT'D I stole it, okay? 
JAY That's what I like. A nice, honest thief. Stole it from who? 
SKANKY GUY They don't even care, man. They leave their money everywhere. 
JAY Who? 
SKANKY GUY I don't know who they are-- 
KAY Then you're not worth much to us, are you? The gun comes back out. 
SKANKY GUY I heard they were Archanans. 
INT. STUDIO APARTMENT 
They move into the room on high alert... But it's empty. They realize the strangeness of the room - alien technology (including a TV hooked up to something strange with tons of wires hanging out) and lots of money.. LOTS of money... Not just piles -- the actual furniture is MADE OF STACKS OF MONEY. They've been using it for scrap paper, for napkins. 
JAY So Yaz was never after you... he was after the Archanans. You just got in the way. 
KAY Which must make them damn important. But what does he want with them? 
JAY 'No sign of struggle. They must've cleared out before he got here. Like they knew he was coming. 
KAY And he's probably on their trail now. But where the hell did they go? They look around, puzzling over this place. Jay picks up a $100 bill off a table made out of stacks of money. 
JAY Think this might tell us something? On the $100 bill: A strange series of words and numbers: 3 2... 5 1... 7 5.. 
KAY Looks like some kind of code. We'll take it to HQ, run it through the computer. Figure out where they went. 
BACK THROUGH THE HALLWAY Jay and Kay walk down the dark hallway -- Yaz steps out of the shadows -- 
BACK IN THE CAR Jay and Kay head back to HQ. Kay drives, Jay stares at the $100 bill, squinting at it, turning it over -- 
JAY How about bible verses? Coordinates? Airplane flights? Shoe sizes? 
KAY So this is how you do it in the future, huh? You just keep guessing until you figure it out? 
JAY 
(EUREKA) Phone numbers! They stop at a light. 
Suddenly -- WHAM! WHAM! Someone FRANTICALLY POUNDS on the trunk -- a frightened 12-year-old prostitute wearing what is basically Jodi Foster's Taxi Driver hooker costume -- hotpants, mary janes, halter top. There's something familiar about her face... 
HOT PANTS GIRL For God's sake! Help me, would you? There's some maniac after me - 
JAY Slow down -- who's after you? 
HOT PANTS GIRL He was like nothing I ever saw -- crazy eyes, and this freaky skull ring. Jay and Kay look at each other: 
JAY Get in. 
HOT PANTS GIRL Thank you so much. This is a dangerous city for a girl. The light turns green -- we're on the girl's face. Jay and Kay looking straight ahead. 
JAY So where can we take you? 
HOT PANTS GIRL Just make a left up here. Kay does it... There's a rushing noise... In the back seat, Hot Pants Girl IS "INFLATING" AND BECOMING 
DEVIL GIRL! The car turns down a dark, deserted alley. 
JAY Are you sure? Seems dangerous. 
DEVIL GIRL Not for me. Reveal -- the girl has fully "inflated" into her natural form -- DEVIL GIRL! The outfit is grotesque on her. 
DEVIL GIRL ATTACKS 
SET PIECE FIGHT in the car. Employing cool MiB tech built into the car. Devil Girl subdued, locked into the trunk in a "CONTAINMENT SACK" -- like what you'd use to stuff a raccoon into. The fight's over, the guys slump against the car. 
KAY Let's get into trouble. Jay and Kay engage him -- As they run off, the Lama calls -- 
LAMA Remember, please, to take the bridge. And we begin 
BIG FIGHT SET PIECE. Try to include motorcycle and horse elements. Could also involve the actual aqueduct, which is close by. At one point, Jay and Kay seem stuck, they remember... 
JAY Take the bridge... They take the bridge, which gives them an advantage on Yaz. At one point, Jay corners Yaz -- Yaz BLASTS HIM -- Jay is knocked down. Looks DEAD! But he shakes it off reveal the PONG medallion blocked the shot. Culminating at a toxic waste dump in Staten Island, with Yaz compressed into .a six inch cube - hauled away in the back of a garbage truck. The guys give chase -- they want him captured, but no luck. The truck drives off... 
KAY He's gone. 
JAY Only a matter of time before he comes back. And this time he might be really mad. 
AQUEDUCT RACE TRACK Jay and Kay return to an EMPTY RACE TRACK... It's like a ghost town. No Archanans to be found... 
JAY Damn, we lost them. They come all the way across the universe and just when we're about to figure out what all of this is about-- Then, faintly... a CHEER 
KAY Hold that thought. They follow it out to 
THE TRACK Which is empty. No spectators, no horses. Just the Archanans... Who stand near the track watching... nothing. And yet -- They cheer and clap as if watching the most exciting race ever. Jay and Kay exchange a "what the hell?" Look and approach them. 
JAY Everybody OK? 
ARCHANANS Everybody is everybody. 
JAY Yeah... guess I can't argue with that. So listen up -- Yaz is down but he won't be for long, so we need to start coming up with some answers. First of all-- The Archanans CHEER. Jay shakes it off. 
JAY (CONT'D) 
FIRST The Archanans CHEER AGAIN. 
JAY (CONT'D) What are you cheering about?! 
ARCHANANS The races. Jay and Kay keep approaching... Puzzled -- the track is empty... 
JAY What races? Jay and Kay cross the threshold into their aura... and now-- The empty stands are FILLED WITH CHEERING SPECTATORS WATCHING 
AN INCREDIBLY EXCITING RACE. 
JAY (CONT'D) Where are we? 
LAMA. We are tomorrow. Jay steps backwards, out of the aura -- back to empty ghost town. Steps back in -- tomorrow's rabid fans, cheering the race. From the Archanans' POV -- we see ALL VERSIONS/ALL AGES OF 
JAY AND KAY.. The effect is -- THEY SEE ALL TIME AT ONCE. 
JAY You... can see the future. 
LAMA It is what you call the future. 
ATTENDANT Ah, the future. An illusion of the time-bound, borne of the fallacy that one moment follows another. 
LAMA Yaz suffers from this greatly. And so he must have revenge on your planet. 
JAY Revenge?, For what? 
(COLD) I thought we were supposed to be the good guys. 
EX Careful, Agent Kay. That sounds like insubordination. Kay walks up to Ex, looks him DEAD IN THE EYE 
KAY It sounds like you need to cut some eyeholes in your stomach, because your head is so far up your ass, that's the only way you could possibly see. 
EX That's it. You're off this case. Stick to dry ice. If I catch you near them -- or him -- again, I'll have your badge. (to a bunch of other 
AGENTS) You four -- take the Archanans to transpo. One of the agents looks up-- 
YOUNG AGENT Me? I'm just an accountant--- 
EX Go!!! 
(TO JAY) And you... You just get out of here! The MiB agents GRAB the Archanans and hustle them out. Kay leans in to them-- 
KAY Don't worry, we'll-- 
LAMA Yes, we know. Kay looks up -- sees Jay smiling at him. 
KAY What? 
JAY I knew Agent Kay wasn't just gonna lie down. So what's the plan? 
KAY You heard the man. We've got dry ice to investigate. 
GARBAGE COMPACTOR TRUCK It's the truck that "compacted" Yaz. We follow it to the 
MIDDLE OF 
GIANT STATEN ISLAND DUMP Where the truck dumps its load... Including YAZ... Who gets PROCESSED AND PRESSED INTO A CUBE. On the cube -- it begins to swell and force itself back into its natural shape. Around the piles of garbage, other Yaz parts SEEK EACH OTHER 
OUT... 
DUMP EXIT Workers stop what they're doing -- get out of the way of something, disturbed. We see Yaz and understand the reaction -- Yaz might be back together, but NOT AT ALL RIGHT -- a leg stuck in the wrong place, the head at a weird angle. He catches his reflection in a hubcap and adjusts himself... Pops out an eye, swaps an arm... He unfurls his tongue, smells the air -- 
YAZ Where did you go... 
SHOWWORLD CENTER A SLEAZY GUY is suprised to see not just an agent... but four agents and four Hare-Krishna-looking guys come out of his peep show window. One of the Archanan attendants smiles at him: 
ATTENDANT 
(CHEERFUL) You will die alone. 
SLEAZY GUY Yeah, I know. The agents lead the Archanans through the world's greatest emporium of sleaze. 
EXT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION 
The hustle and bustle -- cabs picking up and dropping off 
PASSENGERS -- We find a LONG LINE OF UNHAPPY KIDS, MAKING UNHAPPY PARENTS -- Kids crying, pulling on Mom's dress... We see -- it's the line to an ICE CREAM TRUCK. And the line isn't moving because KAY IS QUESTIONING THE 
PAPER-HATTED VENDOR. DRY ICE SMOKE rises from the freezer: 
ZED Detainees are on the tube to Toronto. No sign of Kay. Over. 
EX (V.0.) Copy that, good work, Zed. Zed crosses off... 
JAY Be nice to him. Trust me. Jay, Kay and the Archanans regroup. 
JAY (CONT'D) Okay, you all wanted to go home. Well here we are. So how do you want to get off this rock? You guys have the spaceport on Long Island yet? Kay just looks at him. 
JAY (CONT'D) That place is a dump anyway. Best Margaritas in the Universe, my ass. What about the one in Ohio? The Archanans smile. 
ATTENDANT Here is the way home. The Lama removes a postcard-sized card from his robe and hands it to one of his attendants. The attendant bows, and RITUALLY PASSES IT... it passes through all the attendants and then to JAY. Jay gives it a look. 
JAY Here, huh? You're sure? 
LAMA The only future that ends with life begins there. 
JAY I'll take that as a strong "yes." Okay, then. Follow me. Jay pockets the card and starts herding them across the terminal. Kay catches up -- 
KAY Where are we going? Jay looks at him a beat. 
JAY Omaha. And I'm gonna buy you the biggest T-bone you ever saw when we get there. So -- you head over to the Omaha tube and I'm gonna help these guys over here for a second. But I'll meet you in a minute. By the Omaha tube. They stare at each other -- 
KAY Sounds good. See you there. Kay turns to head off -- then, lightening fast, spins and reaches into Jay's pocket, snatches out the card -- 
KAY (CONT'D) Omaha, my ass. Kay looks at the card: GREETINGS FROM SUNNY FLORIDA -- a tourist post card with palm trees, oranges and beaches. 
KAY (CONT'D) Let's go. 
JAY No, no, no. No way. Florida, Kay. 
KAY That's what it says. 
JAY Don't you get it? 
KAY Yeah, it's hot and muggy. The old people drive slow. 
(MORE) 
KAY (CONT'D) We'll stay somewhere air- conditioned and only drive after three when they're at dinner. 
JAY This is why you were there. In Florida. Because of them. You were helping them and that's why... that's why you get killed. Today, July 16. I saw the report myself. Agent Kay, dead at the scene. Killed by Yaz. 
KAY You know what an MiB agent calls it when he faces death? Besides I got you to watch my back, right? They walk to the FLORIDA TUBE 
JAY I just want you to know, I'm doing this out of love, man. 
KAY Doing what? He gets his answer -- Jay DECKS HIM. 
JAY You stay home and stay alive. But Kay isn't down. 
KAY I told them I'd help them -- I'm honor-bound to do it. Kay throws a DIRTY SUCKER-PUNCH to Jay's kidney. Jay recovers and throws an UPPERCUT to Kay's solar plexus. Jay winces -- like he just hit something hard. 
JAY Damn, you used to have some abs. They continue to pound each other. As they trade punches: 
POOP! 
EXT. FLORIDA SWAMP/MANATEE PRESERVE - END OF THE TUBE 
Jay, Kay and the Archanans are launched from the tube like human cannonballs... The Archanans land gracefully, floating down air currents like kung fu masters... Kay hits with both feet and rolls... Jay face plants into the water. Jay looks up -- FIVE MANATEES STARE HIM DOWN. The ALPHA MANATEE emits along, lowing manatee song which RESOLVES INTO 
COUGHING -- 
ALPHA MANATEE Sorry, I have something in my throat. They went that way... 
JAY Thanks. Surrounded by thick brush, trees. Jay staggers out of the water, looking beat to hell. 
JAY (CONT'D) Kay? Archanans? Everyone OK? 
Reveal -- Everyone else looks clean and pressed. Jay looks around -- nothing but brush and swamp. 
JAY (CONT'D) Listen, your, uh... Arachaness...ness? I don't think this here is the way back to your planet. The Archanans smile and WALK OFF... Jay and Kay follow -- 
JAY (CONT'D) Hey wait -- we can't help you get home, if you don't tell us how... He trails off as they EMERGE FROM THE BRUSH And stop dead... 
JAY (CONT'D) Whoa. So that's how you're getting home. Reveal -- A GLORIOUS SHOT OF THE APOLLO ROCKET And they head towards destiny... 
CAPE CANAVERAL - LAUNCH SITE Jay and Kay take in the MASSIVE SCENE... The huge crowd, the security, the press. HISTORY IN THE 
MAKING. T-Minus 30 minutes. 
JAY Okay. So we've got... 30 minutes to get past security. Get into Mission Control. Reprogram the flight path, pull the Astronauts off the launch and get them in that rocket. 
KAY Well, then. Better get started. 
JAY Weird. I feel like I've been here. 
(BEAT) Okay, I've got a plan to get through security. We just need to be invisible. 
YAZ ON HIS BIKE Hurtling down the highway on his superfast bike, kicking up a 
HUGE DUSTSTORM... He gets STUCK BEHIND AN 18-WHEELER. Yaz REVS -- and SPEEDS 
RIGHT THROUGH THE TRUCK, SPLITTING IT IN HALF. Down the CAUSEWAY -- the rocket in the distance... 
EXT. MISSION CONTROL STRUCTURE ENTRANCE 
Heavily guarded by AIR FORCE SECURITY -- people with a lot of guns and very little sense of humor. And up steps Jay, leading Kay and the Archanans. 
JAY (O.S.) 'Scuse me... I need to get inside... I've got the big man's Cadillac... all washed and ready to- Before the words are out of Jay's mouth, he's down on the ground with a submachine gun stuck in his neck. 
GUARD Move and it's the last thing you do! The security is on Kay and the Archanans, forcing them down. Kay gives Jay a look -- 
KAY Good work. It's like we're not even here. 
GUARD 
(INTO RADIO) Sir, this is unit 3 bravo -- we have an attempted perimeter breach into mission control subhallway Charlie. One caucasian, one negroid, four... other. Yes, sir. We'll hold them here, sir. 
COLONEL (CONT'D) This is your man. The guys approach the Engineer -- 
ENGINEER You see this card? The rocket's flight path is all on cards just like this one. Right here -- He indicates a long metal rack, like a mail-sorting machine, that holds many 1000s of cards and feeds them into a processor. An Archanan approaches and BLOWS ON THE CARDS -- it hits the cards like a mini-whirlwind. The cards spiral everywhere like bats pouring out of a cave -- chads fly off -- they're magically re-programmed! And fly back into the rack. The engineers are STUNNED. And then PANIC: 
ENGINEER (CONT'D) The trajectory has been altered! A BIG LOW-TECH GRAPHIC APPEARS on the BIG LOW-RES MONITOR: 
TRAJECTORY CHANGE. 
ENGINEER (CONT'D) Abort launch! Abort launch! 
JAY Slow down there! Everyone be cool! 
ENGINEER Coolness is an inappropriate response! The Engineer flips the SAFETY off a red button marked "ABORT" 
ENGINEER (CONT'D) Aborting in 5... 
JAY No! Stop! Do not abort! 
ENGINEER 
The Engineer raises his ABORTING HAND -- About to slam it down in the button! 
- KAY This might help. Kay reaches into his jacket, takes out WHAT APPEARS TO BE A 
NEURALIZER 
JAY What's that? You been holding out on me? 
KAY Little something I've been working on. Glasses if you've got 'em. Jay and Kay put on their glasses... 
ENGINEER 
Jay and Kay in sunglasses -- for a moment, it's the iconic look of the posters... 
JAY Ha ha, just like old times... 
KAY Oh, and you might want to get under a desk. 
JAY Get under a--? 
ENGINEER One! The engineers hand comes down... but before he can hit the 
BUTTON -- Kay hits the trigger -- But instead of a FLASH -- A MILLION PELLETS EXPLODE OUT OF THE NEURALIZER -- bouncing everywhere, knocking out the engineers. The pellets KEEP WHIZZING EVERYWHERE THROUGH THE FOLLOWING: Jay and Kay have to talk over the sounds of people getting KO'd. 
JAY What the hell was that?? 
KAY It's a high-velocity non-lethal pellet-gun. The boys in the lab call it the "hiv-nol-pog." 
JAY Catchy. The Archanans deftly step out of the way -- or the pellets swerve around them. EX RUNS IN, flanked by security and/or MiB agents. 
EX It's Kay! There he is! Take him down! Shoot him if you have to! EX catches a PELLET TO THE GROIN, crumples. The pellets settle... quiet... 
P.A. (V.0.) T-minus... Five minutes. The engineers start COMING TO, dazed, wondering WHAT THE HELL JUST HAPPENED -- Kay and Jay give them a "neuralizer" cover 
GUARD (CONT'D) Go ahead. 
LAUNCH PLATFORM Kay loads the Archanans into the capsule., Technicians in clean suits assist. 
Jay works like a secret service agent -- scanning for all possible threats. Jay checks his stop watch -- Four minutes to go... Kay works'with the Archanans-- 
JAY We good yet, Kay? I don't like being out here in the open -- too many ways for Yaz to get to you... 
KAY I'm almost there. Kay's got them inside, but having problems with the hatch. 
KAY (CONT'D) Hey, tech guys -- get back here and help me with the door. 
TECH It's called-a hatch. 
KAY Whatever, just get over here. 
JAY Oh, come on -- what's going on? 
KAY This door is complicated. 
JAY Oh, for... 
KAY What? It's an Apollo rocket, not a Plymouth Valiant, OK? It's complicated. Jay goes over to help Kay with the door. They both fuss and fight over the door. 
JAY Lift it. You have to lift it. 
KAY No, I am lifting it. You have to hold the lever. 
JAY No, if I hold the lever, the rubber thingie won't... go in the thing where the thingie goes... Kay notices something in the reflection of the hatch glass. 
KAY Jay... Why do you think a highly trained NASA technician would leave the back of his suit unzipped? They exchange a look that parallels the opening scene in the Chinese restaurant... 
JAY Because it's about to go down. They turn around, draw weapons on the tech -- it's YAZ! 
NOTE TO READER: Welcome to the good stuff From here, we launch into a GIANT SET PIECE that will take us up and around the Apollo Rocket... As Jay and Kay battle Yaz and Devil Girl in a super-high- stakes confrontation to protect the Archanans... We will pay off that YAZ ISAVIRUS, bentonDESTROYINGTHE EARTH to avenge the deaths ofhis brothers --smallpoxand bubonic plague. The launch clock ticks down -- the action moves around pipes breathing fire, the gigantic scaffolding, liquid oxygen spewing from the rocket... All on top of a rocket taller than a 30-story skyscraper. With T-minus 25 seconds to go, Jay and Kay corner Yaz against the lunar capsule. 
BACK TO SCENE: Yaz laughs at Jay and Kay. 
YAZ You can't stop me! Nothing on Earth can stop me! 
JAY Nothing now. Yaz raises an eyebrow... 
Jay draws his NOISY CRICKET -- the gun he brought from the future. 
KAY What's that? 
JAY Little something I brought with me. Jay points the gun at Yaz -- but Yaz just LAUGHS -- As the clock ticks down to T-minus 5... 4... 
YAZ Try it! You wouldn't dare! One false shot and you'll rip space and time! 
JAY That's a chance I'll have to take. Jay BLASTS YAZ Yaz stumbles BACK INTO THE CAPSULE... The hatch SLAMS him in! Just as the ROCKET BEGINS LIFTOFF-- 
HUGE FLAMES - HUGE CLOUDS OF SMOKE THREATEN TO ENGULF JAY AND 
ARCHANANS Yes. Don't drop it. They take the PONG and drape it around Kay's neck The Archanans leave, chanting... 
ARCHANANS (CONT'D) 
(CHANTING) Bip... Bip... Bip... And it's just Jay and Kay. Jay looks at Kay wearing the PONG... just like in the case file picture... 
JAY Hey. My watch stopped. We see -- a minute to go. Jay looks at the watch. Something about it bothers him... 
KAY C'mon. Let's go watch that bastard leave the atmosphere. 
JAY Yeah, I'll catch up with you in a second. 
KAY GETS INTO THE ELEVATOR Jay hangs back, approaches the Archanans, walks them down the scaffolding. 
JAY So you guys understand all this time stuff, right? So is everything going to be okay now? I mean, if I saved everything, and Yaz is really gone, why am I even here? Shouldn't I not have come in the first place? And why do I still have time left on my watch? 
UNDERGROUND The scaffolding leads Jay and the Archanans into the maze of underground hallways. Jay walks, looking at his watch, thinking... 
,He sees a WALL CLOCK -- 3:59. 
JAY 3:59. But Kay didn't get killed until... And then the AWFUL REALIZATION -- 
JAY (CONT'D) He didn't come yet! Kay, he didn't come yet!!! Jay races to find Kay. 
WITH KAY Unaware that his appointment with death is near... 
WITH YAZ AND DEVIL GIRL Racing down a hallway... hunting Kay... 
WITH JAY Running... running... searching... where is Kay? 
INTERCUT BETWEEN KAY... YAZ... JAY... All converging on destiny... 
WITH JAY Running... more frantic now... And then he sees him! Kay -- at the end of the hallway!. Backlit by the door to the outside... 
JAY Kay! And then Jay sees -- Yazl Already there! Jay goes for his weapon, but he doesn't have the shot! Yaz pulls his guns... 
Kay turns to see Yaz -- there's no time to react, only to know HE'S ABOUT TO DIE! Yaz FIRES!! But -- THE COLONEL is somehow there instead! He catches the bullet for Kay -- his body dematerializes. And it gives Jay the split-second he needs to FIRE ON YAZ AND KILL HIM, blowing him OUTSIDE -- where he is INCINERATED BY LIQUID OXYGEN leftover from the launch. They look at each other -- it's over. 
KAY See? I knew you had my back. Jay hears footsteps. Looks up and sees the SHADOW OF A TALL 
MAN -- REMARKABLY SIMILAR TO JAY'S OWN SILHOUETTE. As the footsteps approach, the shadow grows smaller, shrinking to KID SIZE. It's a boy. 
KID'S VOICE Dad? What's going on? The kid steps into the light -- backlit -- but from the shape of his head and Jay's reaction, this kid could only be YOUNG 
JAY. 
JAY Where there is death, there will always be death. He saved your life. He swapped his for yours. He saved the world. Kay puts a firm hand on Jay -- 
KAY I'll take it from here. Kay steps away... but turns back. In a replay of the moment from the first movie, Jay tosses Kay a modern Neuralizer. 
JAY Leave me some memories this time, 
OK?

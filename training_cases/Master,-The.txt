INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY 
A young man, FREDDIE SUTTON (early 20s)_ speaks to a 
DOCTOR; 
DOCTOR What are you going to do when you get out of here? You're going to have to wear a belt for six months, maybe a year... 
FREDDIE What kind of belt? 
DOCTOR A surgical belt. You won't be able to do very heavy lifting. 
FREDDIE .I try to stay away from that. 
DOCTOR But you spend time outdoors. 
FREDDIE 
MMMM 
DOCTOR What do you do? 
FREDDIE 
DOCTOR You didn't have very much on you when you were admitted. Where were you going? 
FREDDIE I was on my way to Placerville. To the Fair. Had a job waiting for me, with a friend of mine. He doesn't know where I am. 
DOCTOR How old are you, Freddie? 
FREDDIE 
DOCTOR Why don't you turn honest? You seem like an intelligent fellow. 'Quick on your feet - you like to drink? 
FREDDIE It's a weakness. But I like it. 
DOCTOR I know what the other is too. 
FREDDIE How can you tell that? I'm clean. 
DOCTOR The tattoo's. 
FREDDIE Is that a weakness... 
DOCTOR No one ever made money chasing girls. 
FREDDIE You're wrong. This tatoo's my Auntie. 
DOCTOR Who's that? 
FREDDIE My Auntie Bertha, (she raised me.) But that doesn't mean I don't have a weakness... 
DOCTOR College? 
FREDDIE I tried that, it didn't work. 
DOCTOR Why'd you leave? 
FREDDIE Sometimes my hypo's get the best of me, I really feel like walking into the street and hitting people's hats off. 
DOCTOR That's how you end up like this. With a burst appendix. 
FREDDIE That's when I know it's time to get to the sea.. what kind of belt? 
DOCTOR A medical belt. Similar for lifting. You're going to need some money. What do you plan to do? 
FREDDIE I'm going to pay back the hospital. And you. 
DOCTOR You don't owe me anything. I'm on surgical duty. But you're expected to pay the hospital for medicines. And your belt. 
FREDDIE Alright. I intend to do that. You saying you have a job for me? What? As an orderly? 
DOCTOR You couldn't be an orderly, it's too much lifting -- and a lot of things you'd have to learn. But maybe you could run an elevator, something of that sort. 
FREDDIE I want to get out of here, but I also like it here. You think I was gonna die? 
DOCTOR I know you were, Freddie. 
FREDDIE I don't know. I'm not saying you didn't save me... . but...I can't seem to die. 
DOCTOR Too lucky? 
FREDDIE Something like that. 
FREDDIE I saw you. 
DONNA I saw you first. 
FREDDIE What's your name? 
DONNA Donna. What's yours? 
FREDDIE Freddie. 
DONNA That's a nice name. 
FREDDIE This is homemade.. 
DONNA Is it gonna kill me? 
FREDDIE Yes. She sips it. Makes a face. Horrible. 
DONNA Uugugh. 
FREDDIE Taste good? 
DONNA Yeah. They kiss each other. 
DONNA (CONT'D) I have an apricot belly. Want to see it? She shows him her stomach. 
DONNA (CONT'D) I'm really a very good girl. What gives you this idea about me? 
FREDDIE Maybe we think the same things at the same time. 
DONNA Oh my good-ness. I think we do. Want to see my boobs? 
FREDDIE Yes. She pulls her top down, the coat drapped around her-reveals her breasts - 
DONNA Are they nice? 
FREDDIE Yes. 
DONNA Hand made. Chinchilla. Imported. That's enough. She pulls her top back up. 
FREDDIE Wanna go out tonight? 
DONNA Of course. Gllllagh. What's in this? I think I'm cross eyed for good. 
FREDDIE I don't have any cigarettes... 
DONNA What do you make this liquor with? 
FREDDIE There's secrets in liquor, this is just booze. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE. MOMENTS LATER. 
They exit, move away from each other, both drunk.. 
CUT TO: 
INT. PORTRAIT STUDIO AREA. LATER. 
FREDDIE is very drunk and dealing with a very IRRITABLE/VAIN BUSINESS MAN who can't stop doing his hair ...FREDDIE makes some smart ass comments (TBD) to THE MAN. They argue back and forth until: 
FREDDIE LOSES HIS TEMPER WITH THE MAN AND SNAPS. HE 
KNOCKS OVER A LIGHT, DECIDES TO STEAL THE CAMERA WHILE 
HE'S AT IT AND TAKE HIS HOME MADE BOOZE OF FILM 
PROCESSING CHEMICALS WITH HIM. THE WHOLE TIME RANTING AND 
RAVING AT THIS MAN. SECURITY GUARDS come after him, Freddie runs off, through the store - 
DONNA WATCHES HIM GO. HE SHOUTS A FEW SWEET WORDS TO HER 
AS HE GOES -- 
CUT TO: 
INT. SPREKLES SUGAR FACTORY/BEST FARM - SALINAS, CALIF - 
DAY Maybe a few months later, FREDDIE looks worse for wear. He's been hired to work at a BEET DISTILLATE as a BENCH CHEMIST. The FOREMAN walks him though the process; it's clear that there is enough chemicals and beets here to make some good booze... MEXICAN and FILIPINO workers HARVEST THE BEETS, load them to wagons - unload/wash - end up with FREDDIE: He works the bench, making his HOME MADE VODKA. This stuff is quite toxic and very strong. He places it in small, side 
CONTAINER'S -- 
CUT TO: 
INT. BUNKHOUSE - EVENING. 
Freddie and all the workers getting ready for a night out. He's got the Fillipino's and Mexican's working for him squeezing Lemons and Limes, Apples, Beet Juice, in with HOMEMADE POTION.

FREDDIE walks out, looks around. . .he walks down the hall, a YOUNG GIRL passes him, smiles wide and says "GOOD MORNING," ad keeps walking... He moves towards a room where he hears a TYPEWRITER. He steps in the doorway. MASTER sits at his desk, writing gear all around. MASTER looks up, sees him, stops typing... Smiles. Extends his arm out for Freddie to come in and take a seat.. .MASTER is warm, inviting. Not rushed. They sort of sit and settle with each a moment; 
MASTER Ok? 
FREDDIE Alright. 
MASTER You can't be... 
FREDDIE Is this your ship? 
MASTER I'm it's Commander, yes. 
FREDDIE Where's it going? 
MASTER New York City thru the canal. You're seamen? 
FREDDIE Yes.

FREDDIE .what did I say last night...? 
MASTER You said you were an able bodied seamen and you were looking for work? 
FREDDIE You have any? 
MASTER Perhaps. 
FREDDIE What was in my drink? 
MASTER You were sedated with chloral hydrate and bubble gum kisses. Ha ha ha. I'm sure if your check your butt-hole you'll find it's all in working order (he he he...) Isn't that what all men are worried about in they surrender themselves. 
FREDDIE I didn't surrender myself. 
MASTER You were acting very aggressive because you drank too much alcohol. 
FREDDIE I don't think I was. 
MASTER Yes I think you were. And I don't like strange boys jumping on my ship. 
FREDDIE So what are you gonna do? 
MASTER Why don't you just ask for work? Work can't be hard to find. 
FREDDIE Depends on when you're ready to go...do you have a job for me. 
MASTER You can't work in your condition. 
FREDDIE What condition is that? 
MASTER You're aberrated. 
FREDDIE What's that mean? 
MASTER A wandering from the path The problems you have in your life (your appendix, your work, your need to batter your body with booze...) I resolve that they can be fixed. 
FREDDIE I've got no trouble. You got a job for me to do, I can do it. 
MASTER Maybe I do, but not the kind you think. 
FREDDIE Do you own this ship? 
MASTER That's where we go. They come across ALL THE PEOPLE ON BOARD. THEY WALK INTO THE GROUP. Everyone is getting ready for a WEDDING. . .they greet MASTER and FREDDIE. He walks into it and is welcome'd... MASTER finds his daughter, ELIZABETH, who is to be married and her husband-to-be CLARK (20s) He introduces them to Freddie -

CUT TO: 
INT. DINNER CABIN. NIGHT. 
It's mid-dinner, post-wedding ceremony party, everyone is celebrating, drinking. Master talking a blue streak, acting this out. 
MASTER Now, now, now, how 'bout this: Here it comes - swooping down on me: A LARGE 
DRAGON, TEETH AND BLOOD DRIPPING! RED 
EYES! What do I go? A lasoooo! Whip it up, wrap it around it's neck. I wrastle, wrastle, wrastle'em to the ground - I snap up, I say: sit. Everyone laughs, Master is acting all this out, rolling around, etc as if he's training a dog... 
MASTER (CONT'D) Dragon sits. I say: stay. Sragon stays. So now he's got a leash on and he's staying on my command - THAT"S WHAT WHERE WERE AT WITH IT NOW - it stays on command. Everyone is laughing, lapping it all up. He glances; 
MASTER (CONT'D) Next we're gonna teach it to roll over and play DEAD. Master sits down, starts speaking to someone about his days studying Judo ... FREDDIE, sitting up at the dinner table-across the table is: VAL, strikes up conversation: 
VAL Freddie, I'm Val, the son. 
FREDDIE Hello. 
VAL Are you having a good time? 
FREDDIE Yes. 
VAL What are you goign to be working on? 
FREDDIE I don't really know. 
VAL Have you done any time-hole work? 
FREDDIE I don't think so. VAL is distracted by a WELL WISHER who comes over. FREDDIE looks around at everyone. All the faces having a good time and celebrating... He catches the eye of a YOUNG WOMAN. . .then sees her 
HUSBAND... The BARTENDER comes over to FREDDIE 
BARTENDER Alright, old man? 
FREDDIE Yeah. 
BARTENDER No hard feelings? 
FREDDIE No. 
BARTENDER Welcome aboard. Clif Amsbury. He serves him a drink. 
BARTENDER (CONT'D) This one's alright. Chink, chink.

MASTER When can we have some of your potion? 
FREDDIE Whenever you'd like. I'll get making it - 
MASTER When I'd like it - I will give you a signal. I will scratch my ear and rub my nose. What will you need? 
FREDDIE I'll take care of it. MASTER makes his way down the table trying to say goodbye to everyone, he finally tears away from the party by 
SAYING: 
MASTER Enough! Enough! I must get back to work! Keep going! Dont stop all night long! He leaves. FREDDIE just looks around, caught up in it all. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ROOM - LATER. 
Freddie comes down into his little room. A cot has been made for him, some fresh clothes and a BOOK (hardcover,400pages) on the bed. It reads, very simply: 
THE CAUSE 
CU. BOOK "THE CAUSE" The cover is opened, CAMERA SEES IN CU the opening line from the book: "Shall a man be master of his memories? Or shall his memories be the master?" 
ANGLE, FREDDIE He lays in bed and reads the book. He reads about to lines and his eyes slam shit, asleep, still holding the book. 
HOLD. 
CUT TO:

CUT TO: 
INT. MAIN CABIN - EVENING. 
A SKETCH COMEDY SHOW, DANCING after-dinner. FREDDIE on the sidelines, watching it, not really understanding some of the humor and lyrics, etc...someone has a MOP on their head and is pretending to be a PSYCHOLOGIST with a vary thick/bad German-Austiran-accent. "zee muzzer and fazzer and zee penisss and ze nippelz.." attempting to cure a STUDENT... everyone LAUGHS. ELIZABETH (the daughter) comes over; 
ELIZABETH Hi Freddie ... 
FREDDIE Hi. 
ELIZABETH .I Have a message for you. She rubs her nose and tugs her ear. 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) Better get along. He leaves, she watches him go. 
CUT TO: 
INT. FREDDIE'S AREA. MOMENTS LATER. 
He puts the booze into MASON JARS. 
CUT TO: 
INT HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER 
FOLLOWING FREDDIE HOLDING THE BOOZE IN A LITTLE MASON 
JAR. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MASTER'S SUITE. THAT MOMENT. 
Freddie pours the liquid into two glasses. WE HEAR THE PARTY OUTSIDE THE ROOM, FROM UPSTAIRS. MASTER examines 
IT; 
MASTER What's in it? 
FREDDIE .drink just a little. It's very strong. The good stuff takes time. And there's secrets in good liquor. This is just booze for now... 
MASTER How are you feeling, Freddie? 
FREDDIE Good. 
MASTER Rested? 
FREDDIE Yes. 
MASTER Excited? 
FREDDIE Sure. 
MASTER Have you made some friends? 
FREDDIE Yes. 
MASTER Good. Good. How are you feeling? 
FREDDIE Yeah, good. They CHEERS AND DRINK. Shudder at the strength of it. 
MASTER I've been writing ... BULAGH! Feel like I went under. Dark cloud rolls in. Opens up...anxious to share new work-would you care for some informal processing? 
FREDDIE Sure... 
MASTER Well, then I gather myself... and you be my protege and guinea pig, eh? Informal processing. Master smiles, excited, moves to an OLD TAPE RECORDER, points a microphones towards Freddie, looks over some papers... 
MASTER (CONT'D) Are you ready? 
FREDDIE 
BLLLLLLLLLL GH. How's that? (laughs hysterically) 
MASTER Silly..its good to laugh in processing.. sometimes we forget. Master reaches down, brings the microphone to his mouth: 
MASTER (CONT'D) "Freddie Sutton, Test Session. May 5, 1952, 1800 hours. Aboard he sailing vessel Aletheia, en route to New York City. MOC logged ad approced." He CLICKS it off. Smiles at Freddie; he gives him a comforting hug. 
MASTER (CONT'D) Should we sample another sip before we join them upstairs? 
FREDDIE Is that it? 
MASTER For now. 
FREDDIE I'm ready for more if you want to ask me... 
HOLD BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM. LONG PAUSE. 
FREDDIE (CONT'D) Ask me, Master. This is fun.. .nobody's asked me questions before -- 
MASTER Could you answer the next series of questions without blinking your eyes? To without fear and hesitation answer as quickly as you can? 
FREDDIE Sure. 
CU. TAPE RECORDER BACK ON. 
MASTER Look at me...Starting now you are not to blink. If you blink we go back to the 
START: .infringement. you blinked. Starting now you are not to blink. If you blink we go back to the start. Do you often ponder over your own inferiority? 
FREDDIE No. 
MASTER Infringement. Back to the start. You blink, we repeat from the start. Do you often ponder over your own inferiority? 
FREDDIE Yes. 
MASTER Do you believe that God will save you from your own ridiculousness and self contempt? 
FREDDIE No I don't. 
MASTER Have you ever had intercourse with a member of your family. 
FREDDIE Yes. 
PAUSE. 
MASTER Have you ever had intercourse with a member of your family? 
FREDDIE Yes. 
MASTER .who? 
FREDDIE My. Auntie. PAUSE. Master is stumped for the first time... 
MASTER Have you ever killed anyone? 
FREDDIE No, 
MASTER Maybe? 
FREDDIE Not me. 
TAPE RECORDING ALL THIS. DIALS MOVING. FREDDIE NOT 
BLINKING. 
MASTER Have you ever killed anyone. 
FREDDIE No. 
MASTER How many times did you have intercourse with your aunt? 
FREDDIE Three times. 
MASTER Where is your aunt now? 
FREDDIE Don't know. Probably Princeton. 
MASTER Where? 
FREDDIE 45 Province Lane. 
MASTER Would you like to see her? 
FREDDIE No. 
MASTER Would you like to sleep with her again? 
FREDDIE No. 
FREDDIE I don't know. Maybe New York, New Jersey, anywhere. Don't know. 
MASTER What is your Auntie's Name? 
FREDDIE Auntie Bertha. 
MASTER How did you come to sleep with your Auntie Bertha? 
FREDDIE She said she'd let me have my inheritance if I were to sleep with her. So I did and I never got my money. I was drunk. She looked good. 
MASTER And you did it again and again. 
FREDDIE Yes. Because I liked it. It felt good. 
MASTER She's rich? Is she? She has your inheritance, does she? 
FREDDIE She controls it all. 
MASTER You feel you're owed this? 
FREDDIE I am. 
MASTER Have you ever had any bad thoughts about her or Mary Sue? 
FREDDIE Yes. 
MASTER What do you think? 
FREDDIE I thought you were fools. But now I see that you're not 
MASTER If you could lock yourself in a house, a large mansion for the rest of your life: who would you like to be there with you? 
FREDDIE Doris Schoemann. 
MASTER Who is Doris? 
FREDDIE Best girl I ever met. The girl I am gonna marry one day. 
MASTER She's in New Jersey, is she? 
FREDDIE Lynn, Massachussets. ( I just got to get back to her.) 
MASTER Why aren't you with Doris? 
FREDDIE 
MASTER Why aren't you with her? 
FREDDIE I'm an idiot. I don't know. I got no reason. 
MASTER Do you love Doris? 
FREDDIE Yeah. 
MASTER Is she the love of your life? 
FREDDIE Yes sir. 
MASTER Close your eyes/ 
CUT TO BLACK, HOLD, THEN FADE UP AGAIN.. 
MASTER (CONT'D) Release and return to me ... Say your name. 
FREDDIE Freddie Sutton. 
MASTER Are you hear with me in 1952? 
FREDDIE Yes... 
MASTER End of session. Open/close your eyes. He laughs. They both laugh, MUSIC 'dancers in love'/piano ver. 
MASTER (CONT'D) How does it feel? Freddie laughs a little. 
FREDDIE Feels good. 
MASTER Left side of your body feels ok? 
FREDDIE Yeah. 
MASTER Right side? 
FREDDIE Yeah. 
MASTER Any headaches? 
FREDDIE 
NO 
MASTER (CONT'D) But that doesn't mean it's not there, does it? No. It doesn't. That flimsy little piece of tape is just nothin' without all the other equipment lined up properly, isn't it? We CAN access the past, traumas and seeds that abberate us in present time and once we access them - we challenge them and throw them away. Previously, I'd established how to access these aberrations and painful memories to pre-birth/cellular times. But the new studies prove there is a time beyond that. The Whole-of-time with which we are now working. At last count, perhaps sixty-seven trillion years our studies show... Besides the everyday struggles of how we become better, more able, more productive homo sapiens, the uses for this new science is the location and removal of certain leukemias, apathies, manics. Depressives, perverts, stuttering, neuroses, ulcers, arthritis, and asthmas. This is the province and science of Cause. If you'll forgive me, I must sit down. Perhaps you've taken notice of my leg injury and limp damndest thing. You see it happens every time I come to Manhattan Island, its a wound I've never conquered and I'll tell you how I found out about, because I never knew what in the H was happening... Well I did some processing to find out. Took Mary Sue to ay me down and lead me back...we processed over three hours! And something came up. It was this: I lived a life before and suffered a great injury. Knee injury... It was just around 1888. A great number and year. Significant as the creation . year of the new york city sewer system if I'm not wrong... I was a thief and criminal, working late into the night robbing a bank in the western side of the island. 
(MORE) 
MASTER (CONT'D) The crime was committed with a revolver in hand. A Cole .45. My accomplices and I made it clear across town when we were ambushed by the local authorities. -- but I made a slip away. A digression into the under constructed sewer system. It was here that I could no be found - or so my thinking went. All my confidence and all my arrogance was brought upon me. Full in the face. For I was nose to nose with a twenty-five foot alligator in the New York City sewer. Oh brother! What a scare I was in for. Now if you've veer seen the SNAP! SNAP! SNAP! OF A GATOR - you'll remember the fear. You see, this being an island, and in those days more inhabited by creature than man, why wouldn't I meet such a beast? In my evasion -- I dropped the gold. The money I'd stolen in my getaway.. .not dropped, but stuffed in a newly cemented drain hole just around 125th Street... present day Harlem County I believe today. Yes. Yes. I stuffed it and made a getaway from both man and beast âshattered my knee in five different places-turned into a piece of glass..woke up early in the morning somewhere near the present day Times Square-which was nothing more than a farm..quite a farm..but that's another story. So what does this say? Injuries stay with us don't they??..They sure do. How's it gonna go away. How? How? How'm I gonna fix this knee. How are any of us going to get better? More able? We Must Process The Whole Of Time. This Life and Pre Natal Cellular processing is not enough. We have Lived Many, Many, Many Lives. So anybody tat is not processing the whole of time - is doing a disservice to man and Will Not Get Better. I cannot put it more simply. 
(MORE) 
MASTER (CONT'D) And as for me now: I just need to find the time away from all of my writing to go back down and DO IT so I don't walk around with the darndest limp everytime I come to town! This story is greeted. with equal parts excitement/complete CONFUSION. MRS. PURCELL slightly nervous. 
ANGLE, LATER. MASTER and a SOCIALITE WOMAN (50s) he has her lay down on a love seat; 
MASTER (CONT'D) What is your name? 
SOCIALITE Margaret O'Brian. 
MASTER Are you sure you haven't lived here before? 
SOCIALITE I don't know. 
MASTER What's your name? 
MARGARET Margaret. 
MASTER Are you sure? 
ANGLE, PURCELL APARTMENT. FREDDIE goes lurking around, slinks in and out of some rooms. HE GOES INTO THE BEDROOM, STEALS SOME JEWELRY. 
STUFF HIS POCKETS. (OC DIAL. PLAYS...) 
ANGLE, MAIN LIVING ROOM. MASTER has finished his demonstration and is opening it up for questions/discussions. An OLDER MAN (MR. JOHN MORE, 50's, scholarly, wearing a prominent HANDKERCHIEF) stands up to speak: (Throughout this another OLDER WOMAN has a terrible cough from the back of the room.) 
JOHN MORE Some of this seems quite like hypnosis, is it not? 
MASTER Oh no, this is funny. It's quite the reverse. Man is hypnotized. What we do is un-hypnotize him of the shackles. Allow him to raise his awareness and IQ. 
JOHN MORE What is the difference between this and psychotherapy? 
MASTER Yes. Well. They are very different. No. Psychoanalysis, they lay back. No, no, no. Don't associate us with such people! That's terrible (he, he) why that's a bad manner don't you know? I mean at that business about sex and all that. That's for the neurotic or the person who is insane or something like that. That's nothing to do with us. They've failed. That's for the fortunate few who can afford the fees. 
JOHN MORE But some of this does in fact seem to share quite a lot with Dr. Freud and modern psychotherapy, does it not? 
MASTER No it does not. This is an exact science, you see. Comparable to physics or chemistry - but simpler. It's engineering. Herr Freud had his chance and contributed some very workable data, but in the end, he failed. So that's that. 
JOHN MORE And how long does this take? 
MASTER That depends. But it can be quite fast. Quite fast. Or it can take some time. Sometimes less than 36 hours. 
JOHN MORE 36 hours? And you're saying that these methods can cure leukemia according to your book and what you've just said? 
MASTER Some forms of leukemia, 22 cases tested. 22 cases cured. Those are the results. 
JOHN MORE You can understand scepticism, can you not? 
MASTER Oh, yes, of course, yes. And this is to be expected and welcome. For without it we'd be positive's with no negatives - therefore zero. charge. We must have it. 
JOHN MORE Are you a religious people? 
MASTER We are not incorporated as a religion, no. But remember this: that religion has come uniformly from a philosophy. Philosophy is senior to religion. You could call us a religion of religions. 
JOHN MORE Are you saying then that any religion is rather narrow in its outlook? 
MASTER No, no, no. I have no quarrel with man's belief's, but religions in general can be pre-occupied with a God or Idol or something of some such nature who is merely trying to fill the universe with a lot of little replicas of himself - we are trying to free the individual - not bend to a will of a God, you see. And if our teachings can reconcile these views it would be doing a great service to 
MANKIND - 
JOHN MORE Do you think it can? 
MASTER I not only think it can, I know it does. 
JOHN MORE You mentioned 'good science' and what it does.. .but doesn't that, by definition, allow for more than one opinion? 
MASTER Indeed, indeed. Which is why our gathering of day-ta is so far reaching - 
JOHN MORE Otherwise you merely have the will of one man - which is the basis of cult, is it not? 
MASTER T'is, t'is, indeed. Thankfully we are, all of us, working at break-neck speeds and in unison towards catching the minds fatal flaws and correcting it back to it's original state of perfect - whilst righting civilization. 
JOHN MORE I must say that I find it quite -- 
MASTER 
AND I DON'T FUCKING CARE WHAT ELSE YOU 
HAVE TO SAY YOU SLIMY LITTLE PIECE OF CUM 
FUCK. 
YOU ARE NOTHING. AND WORTHLESS AT THAT. 
FREDDIE Thizz helped me. It can help you.. you can go back in time and learn thingz... He is about to say.. 
FREDDIE (CONT'D) (wanna fuck?) But he PASSES OUT, FACE FIRST ON THE TABLE. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HOTEL/HALLWAY - NIGHT - LATER 
CLARK is dragging FREDDIE down the hall, passed out...he gets him to the room... opens the door..pulls him inside... 
FADE OUT. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - MORNING 
.FREDDIE wakes up. Takes him a good long time. CAMERA just watches. He soaks everything in, thinks, thinks, thinks. He puts the pieces together of last night an the last few days. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MASTER'S HOTEL ROOM - NEXT MORNING 
START CU. ON MASTER. He looks down at something in his hands, quietly inspects it, looks up: FREDDIE is here, he's given him the HANDKERCHIEF. HOLD between them, then; 
MASTER What is it? 
FREDDIE I don't think John More will be speaking out against you again. 
MASTER This isn't the way...you heard me say to attack and you attacked? 
FREDDIE You were right. 
MASTER 
FREDDIE You were right. . .he had a wise-ass mouth. 
MASTER My little Soldier.. .what did you do?... . you need to tell me so that I know... 
FREDDIE That's why I won't tell you. Nothing bad. Just scared him good. 
WIDEN ANGLE, THAT MOMENT. Reveal MARY SUE is here, listening... Master looks to Mary Sue, back to Freddie: 
MARY SUE Whatever you've done, best not come back to Master or the Cause. 
FREDDIE It won't. 
MASTER But-this-is-not-the-way-you-naughty-boy. Ok? Alright. Freddie: You-are-mischeif. Horrible young man you are! The PHONE RIGHTS, Mary Sue moves and picks it up, speaks OC, we stay with MASTER and FREDDIE: 
MASTER (CONT'D) How are you...? How do you feel to be so close to your Auntie - just across the river? Close to the incident of this present time? 
FREDDIE I don't really think about all that stuff with my Auntie, you know ...I got other things going on besides that thing I told you about.. .that's yesterday's news to me, so... 
MASTER Your problems aren't with your auntie or your mommy or daddy or any such things. 
FREDDIE 
MASTER You have seeded aberrations in this way. Absolute rejection of authority and nay- sayers. 
FREDDIE I don't like smart-mouths. If that's what you mean.

FREDDIE I don't want to talk to you right now. 
MASTER This is FBI work, Russians maybe... this... too much work for the 
AMA... 
FREDDIE Stop talking... 
MASTER You're fear of capture and imprisonment is an implant from millions of years ago. An Invader Force played games with your spirit as it.moved from one body to the next - free for a moment - it was free and the invader force captured it - spun you around in a device not unlike a grinder and hit you with waves of high wattage electrical impulses - quaver bolts to damage you. The impulse lodges and plants the push-pull instinct, dumped in scalding hot water, then freezing cold - a control mechanism - any legal action, a summons to court, the sight of a police officer, exposes a glandular reaction and anxiety wave of the highest order, 
TRIGGERED - the mere threat of arrest will make a psychotic breakdown. This happened to you and you are free to stop it. Their game and implants are no match for you. Laugh in their face. Laugh at it. These triggers are useless now. You created THEM so YOU can DESTROY THEM. MASTER pulls away ... FREDDIE looks at him. HOLD. 
FREDDIE Horseshit. 
MASTER I don't have any opinions. I'm giving you facts. 
FREDDIE Just shut-your-mouth? You're a fucking 
DRUNK.

I'm the best and only friend you have, shut me up from saving you? HELPING YOU. ONLY WAY. FIND ANOTHER ONE, YO-YO. You wanna get rid of this or live this way or MASTER it? 
(MORE) 
MASTER (CONT'D) You listen - you wanna spit in that cops face for touching you? I'm gonna beat him with you. Bash his skull in. BUT DON'T 
TURN ON ME, DRUNK. Long silence. They sit in it. 
FREDDIE Helen's house...all those girls walking around, the wives of ... . I want to fuck all of them. 
MASTER Sex is not an aberration. Never has been. So what's wrong?

FREDDIE I don't belong in here, man. I gotta get out of here... 
MASTER You belong at sea. 
FREDDIE .hmph...

GEORGE I honestly feel an apology is in order. 
AMELIA Fine.   What have I done? She watches his smile. 
AMELIA (CONT'D) I didn't mind waiting. Caught up on my reading. Knitted a sweater. 
GEORGE I mean an apology.   For what's coming. His voice softens. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) I'm going to be pretty controlling these next few months. How you dress, move, cut your hair. Speak in public. It's all part of the package we're selling. 
AMELIA We. 
GEORGE That's right. If you're not in there selling with me, it won't work. The smile turns friendly. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) You're the star. I'm no one at all. 
AMELIA Spoken like a gentleman. She steps up onto the train. Extends her hand like a man. He shakes it firmly. The train begins to move. She watches his cheery wave as she rolls away. 
AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D) Of course a gentleman. Would have paid for my ticket. 
INT. TRAIN - LATER 
Gazing out the window as she rattles toward Boston. She looks down now to a notebook in her lap. As she flips pages, we see it is a collection of hand-written POEMS and thoughts. She writes... 
AMELIA (V.O.) Courage is the price that life exacts For granting peace We SUPERIMPOSE over her image the wall of a little girl's bedroom, filled with treasured NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS about women doctors, officials, bank presidents, women who had established themselves in positions previously thought to be available only to men. 
AMELIA (V.O.) The soul that knows it not Knows no release From little things 
DISSOLVE TO HER 
MEMORY OF... 
EXT. FIELD, DES MOINES - DAY 
Two LITTLE GIRLS, maybe 10 years old, walking in a field. Amelia and a girlfriend. They stop, hearing... The DRONING of an engine, a small red plane APPEARING above the treetops. The pilot seeing two girls alone in the field, SWOOPS down to BUZZ them. Amelia's friend runs for her life. But Amelia stands still, throws her arms WIDE, and the plane... ...DROPS lower, and LOWER, as it CLOSES straight in on the slender girl with her outstretched arms. LOUDER and FASTER, as if intent on winning some impulsive duel of wills. The aircraft SCREAMS past, just above her head. 
AMELIA (V.O.) As the little red airplane passed by, it said something to me. Amelia beams.   She fills her lungs, transported. 
AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D) I don't think I've ever stopped listening. HOLD on her, hair and uniform whipping in the breeze. 
SMASH CUT TO... 
INT. AMELIA'S PLANE - DAY 
Amelia flying her little yellow Kinner.   Feeling the freedom she thrilled to as a A child. 
MELIA (V.O.) Ten years, 28 jobs and an unspeak- able number of crashes later, I hadn't changed my mind. She LIFTS the nose of the tiny craft.   Begins to CLIMB. 
AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D) I even had my own plane. Bought with my last dime. At the apex of her climb, she FLIPS into a breathtaking LOOP THE LOOP, as... 
AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D) Course in the early days of flying... ...her engine SPUTTERS. Then STALLS.    The plane DIPS into a TAIL-SPIN, PLUNGING downward... 
AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D) ...crashing was so common, you almost forgot it could kill you... Amelia STRUGGLING to start the engine, the little plane HURTLING toward earth, SPINNING as it goes. 
AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D) ...until it did. The engine COUGHS to life and at the last second she SWOOPS harrowingly above the ground to SOAR FREE. 
AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D) Almost. 
EXT. AIRFIELD - DAY 
A small HANGAR in a lonely field.   See a group of... ...MECHANICS in their grease-stained jumpsuits. Three big guys and one little one working on an engine that's been pulled from Amelia's Kinner. When the little guy comes up for air... ...he isn't a guy at all. 
AMELIA Got it.   I think. 
INT. DENISON HOUSE, BOSTON - DAY 
SAM CHAPMAN, a handsome young man is being led down an institutional hallway and out onto the grounds of this venerable settlement house. He finds... ...Amelia sitting cross-legged on the grass. Reading to a group of CHINESE GIRLS, who hang on her every animated word. On the periphery, ADULTS sit, taking in the story. They are of various ethnicities, homeless or handicapped or immigrant. 
A Two are blind. Amelia sees Sam... 
MELIA Girls, this is Mr. Samuel Chapman. Sam, say hullo to the Octopus Club. The Octopus Club waves to Sam.   The adults wave, too. 
AMELIA (CONT'D) You're just in time. Alice has come through the Looking Glass, and things are getting, well... 
GEORGE Say hello to Slim Gordon your navigator. She is shaking hands in that strong, direct way. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) And Bill Stultz here, simply the most talented pilot working. She takes Bill's powerful hand. The look between them calm, yet somehow intense. As if each is establishing a tone for their relationship. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) We've got Byrd's pilot, we've got his plane... 
AMELIA 
Y ou mean the Admiral flies on those? The pontoons.   She does not seem admiring. 
GEORGE Nope, those are new, personally suggested by the old man himself. Bill nods on that.   Sure were. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) This way, if you're forced down at sea, you can wait for a rescue. 
AMELIA Hmmn.   What does that do to our fuel? 
BILL Costs us at least 400 gallons. Don't bother bringing clothes for Paris, we'll be lucky to hit the nearest beach in Ireland. Real lucky. 
GEORGE The Admiral estimates the pontoons only cut our range by 200 miles. But Amelia looks to Bill.   That's not really possible is it? 
BILL The Admiral is the Admiral. He gets to estimate any damn thing he wants. All we have to do is figure out how to fly without petrol. She turns to George with challenging eyes. 
BILL (CONT'D) Don't go blaming the bookseller. He's been all through this with Mrs. Guest, but she worships the Admiral. And it's money that puts planes in the air. 
AMELIA I wonder if it can keep them up there. Not that I've ever had enough to try. 
Bill's small smile.   Maybe the girl's all right. 
EXT. DOCK - LATER 
George and Amelia approach a waiting motorboat, as the lights of Boston glimmer across the harbor. His head is down. She's watching his profile. 
AMELIA Sorry.    I'll try keeping my mouth shut. 
GEORGE What I ought to try. Is listening to you once in awhile. 
H e meant that.   And she seems oddly touched. 
AMELIA Careful.    I could get to like it. No reaction from him. He hops into the boat. Turns, holds out his hand. She hesitates. Clearly doesn't need his help to jump into a boat. Their eyes lock. We are watching her decide. And then... She reaches to clasp his hand.   Hops down beside him. 
AMELIA (CONT'D) Thank you, Simpkin. Thank you for everything. 
GEORGE (a smile) Simpkin. 
AMELIA It's in a book. Oh, that's right. You read the ones you publish. Her smile is friendly, not flirtatious. She goes to sit in the bow. He doesn't follow. But he is watching. 
EXT. ROOF, COPLEY PLAZA HOTEL - DAY 
Amelia in a flying outfit.   Hands on her hips as if posing. 
AMELIA (V.O.) There's a Beatrix Potter story about a cat named Simpkin. PULL BACK to see the PHOTOGRAPHER, George beside him. They are on a hotel rooftop, precariously high above Boston. 
T 
A 
AMELIA (V.O.) He wasn't happy unless he had several mice, each under a different teacup. So he could never become bored. We see that Amelia's POSE looks exactly the SAME as a photo of CHARLES LINDBERGH in the photographer's hand. It is labeled `LUCKY LINDY.' 
AMELIA (V.O.) THe illusion of activity was essential for him to feel at peace. The photographer now shows George ANOTHER PHOTO of Lindbergh in a different pose. 
AMELIA What are you boys doing over there? 
GEORGE Trying to make you look like a girl. George studies the photo, then goes to Amelia and begins moving her body into the new pose. Tilting her head to Lindbergh's angle. 
MELIA (V.O.) I wondered.     Was I Mr. Putnam's 43rd mouse?     Or his 307th. Now touching her, adjusting her coat, fluffing a bit of her hair, pulling the collar around to frame her face... 
G 
EORGE he more we can make you look like a girl, the better. 
AMELIA Oh god, is it worth the effort? He cocks his head, studies her.    Nah, guess not. 
GEORGE Wondering who should play you in the film of all this. I'm thinking Chaplin. 
AMELIA Hi there, boys. How are the ham and eggs? The FLASHES EXPLODE as one.   They keep POPPING as Amelia makes her way to them. 
BILL Don't blame us, lady. I think somebody's starting to sell books. The reporters are handing her their morning editions. The New York Times front page headline: BOSTON GIRL STARTS FOR 
ATLANTIC HOP. There beneath the headline, the glamorous PHOTO we watched being taken on the Copley Hotel roof, Lady Lindy. Next to it, an earlier photo of her as a demure social worker. 
A melia is sifting through the other papers, grinning and shaking her head. 
EPORTER Say, Amelia. What have you got for Mabel Boll to chew on? 
AMELIA Now why would a famous gal like Mabel give a thought to someone like me? I don't have a single sweater made out of gold. The boys ROAR, Slim louder than anyone. Even Bill cracks a smile. They're shouting, teasing, YOU CAN'T KID US! 
AMELIA (CONT'D) Hey, not even silver. The boys make room.   Bill rises to hold Amelia's chair.    A friendly murmur... 
BILL The ham's a little tough, Commander. But the bacon's swell. 
INT. WALDORF-ASTORIA HOTEL - DAY 
MOVIETONE NEWSREEL footage, accompanied by their signature fanfare theme. Once more, the hotel conference room jammed with press. Today Mabel wears a luxurious silver fox coat, shimmies up to a bank of microphones at the podium. Flashes start POPPING. 
ANNOUNCER (O.S.) The Queen of Diamonds Mabel Boll, upstaged by upstart social worker, seems madder than a rich wet hen. Hey Mabel, tell us about your rival! The sound switches to Mabel leaning her sultry voice to the mikes... 
MABEL Well, how would any woman feel about some tart who steals her man? Reporters furiously writing, more flashes EXPLODE. 
MABEL (CONT'D) Bill Stultz and I were going to make history together, until this poor little social worker and her sugar daddy, oh excuse me, `publisher,' started throwing money and I don't know what else at him. 
R 
EPORTER Mabel, are you implying Miss Earhart used her feminine charms on your pilot? 
MABEL I don't know, Charlie, I never seen her. Has she got any? LAUGHTER, they're all calling out.   She shows them a smoky smile, but stays on message. 
MABEL (CONT'D) Well, she had to use something on somebody to get from nowhere to here. You figure it out, or wait til George Putnam feeds it to you. Two dozen questions at once.   She's not even listening. 
MABEL (CONT'D) We're going to Canada, waiting for some good weather on the Atlantic, and then we'll kick Little Miss Whoozis in the keester. 
REPORTER What makes you so cocky that she won't leave first? 
MABEL Rusty, we can carry enough fuel to go to China. That thing they're flying can't load enough gas to make Yonkers. Tell that to Putnam's girlie. And while you're at it... She snuggles the gleaming fox fur around her. 
MABEL (CONT'D) Tell her I do wear silver.   So I'm two up on her. 
EXT. HARBOR, TREPASSEY, NEWFOUNDLAND - EARLY MORNING 
MOVIETONE NEWSREEL CONTINUES. We are looking at foggy, bleak Trepassey Harbor as the Friendship makes an unsuccessful attempt to take off. 
ANNOUNCER (O.S.) Eleven days of failure for plucky Amelia Earhart and her crew. If it isn't storms over the Atlantic, it's the inability of the seaplane's pontoons to lift from the sea. 
S ERIES OF ANGLES.    One failed take-off after another. 
ANNOUNCER (O.S.) (CONT'D) Perhaps it's for the best. Remember, no woman has beat the jinx of the Atlantic and three have died trying. Including a princess and the niece of former President Woodrow Wilson. The plane's engine SPUTTERS and STALLS.     It floats on the sea. 
ANNOUNCER (O.S.) (CONT'D) Maybe this one's not to be. Hey, Mabel! How's your weather report? 
INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR, NEWFOUNDLAND - LATE NIGHT 
Amelia coming down the hotel corridor. She passes a room, and hearing DRUNKEN LAUGHTER from a group of MEN within the room... She stops.    Stares at the door with more concern than anger.

INT. HOTEL ROOM, NEWFOUNDLAND - LATER 
SHERIFF (CONT'D) Because you're stuck with it. From here on. She is brought to a smiling avuncular HILTON RAILEY, standing beside the closest thing Burry Port has to a limo. She throws an affectionate arm around him, kisses his cheek. 
AMELIA Hullo, Hilton. Railey stands back as FLASHBULBS catch the moment.   He's brought photographers with him. And more. 
R 
AILEY Amelia, say hullo to Allen Raymond of the New York Times. A hearty handshake.   She holds out her sheets of paper. 
AMELIA I believe you've come for these. Both men regard the pages as if they were gold bullion.     Come for these indeed. 
EXT. SOUTHAMPTON - DAY 
MOVIETONE FOOTAGE of Amelia being welcomed by a SEA OF PEOPLE on the dock at Southampton. A mob . Folks spilling into the water. Ships circling, fireboats spray, every craft BLARES its horn. Police hold back the screaming throng as FLASHES EXPLODE and NEWSREEL CAMERAS CHURN. Amelia at the center of the storm. Welcomed by AMY GUEST and the lady LORD MAYOR of Southampton. Throughout, we see SUPERIMPOSED IMAGES of the article she gave Railey, displaying her byline, on the front pages of the London Times, New York Times, the Times of India, Sydney Morning Herald, the Toronto Star, Le Monde, as her story echoes around the world. These IMAGES CONTINUE OVER...

INT. HYDE PARK HOTEL, LONDON - DAY 
MOVIETONE NEWSREEL CONTINUES. The British press are gathered in a huge Victorian parlor. Dark woods, rich leather, a bank of microphones, an electric expectancy... Bill and Slim stand next to a seated Amy.    Amelia steps to the microphones... 
AMELIA I was a passenger on this journey. Just a passenger. Everything that was done to bring us across was done by Wilmer Stultz and Slim Gordon. All the praise... 
REPORTER (calls out) But you can fly, can't you? Amelia stares at the man.    Conflicting agendas. 
AMELIA This flight was solely to the credit of Bill and Slim. Women should know, however, that I have had 500 hours solo flying and once held the women's altitude record. 
REPORTER So you could have done it yourself! 
AMELIA This particular flight, under these conditions, I wonder if anyone but Bill Stultz could have pulled it off. But certainly, one day a woman will do this. As easily, as skillfully, as professionally as any man. Such calm self-possession.    Such confidence in that. 
Y

AMELIA (CONT'D) Aviation is clear today for the pioneer. And if the pioneer has good ideas nobody will ask whether P            the pioneer is a man or woman. olite applause.       Mostly from women.   She looks around the room. 
AMELIA (CONT'D) I hear your doubt. That doubt is our challenge. This is where our Atlantic flight, or any other good flight by a woman can help... She nods.    To them, to herself. 
AMELIA (CONT'D) It starts women thinking. 
EXT. BROADWAY, NEW YORK CITY - DAY 
Ticker tape PARADE down Broadway, crowds lining the streets, leaning from windows to welcome Amelia home. 
UPERIMPOSE:       NEW YORK CITY Amelia sits in an open car between Bill and Slim, WAVING to everyone. In the front seat, George and Dorothy share the moment. 
EXT. RECEPTION HALL - DAY 
Amelia flanked by George and Dorothy, coming out of a reception hall. Amelia glances to George... 
AMELIA Guess you can burn those letters. Dorothy wonders.       Letters? 
GEORGE I saved them for your book. One simple shake of Amelia's head.       A soft... 
AMELIA The book's yours.     The letters are mine. He smiles.       Bows in submission. 
GEORGE ou're the boss. 
DOROTHY Hey, that's my job. (to Amelia) Do you think there's enough of him to boss for the two of us? Amelia still looking at George.    Laughs. 
AMELIA Barely enough for one. A battery of reporters and flashbulbs wait by our motorcade. 
REPORTER Miss Earhart, can you tell us some- thing about your future plans? 
S he likes this question.    Fixes the man with that clear, honest gaze. 
AMELIA Well, being a social worker by trade and passion, I'll be going back to work at Denison House when all this fun is over. She sends the guy a smile, and a dozen FLASHES catch it. 
AMELIA (CONT'D) ...if I haven't been fired. George holds the door of their limo. She looks up to him with a mischievous smile. And with no warning... ...Amelia bypasses the limo, climbs into the SIDECAR of a cop's motorcycle, and SMACKS its side. The cop looks up to George, who... ...nods, go for it. And the cop DOES, wheeling out into traffic, opening up the SIREN, as everyone laughs or cheers or darts into the street desperate for a fleeting photo. George watching her go.    Dorothy watching George. 
REPORTER Mr. Putnam, sir. How did a social worker like Miss Earhart become comfortable as a celebrity so quickly? George smiles.   His eyes still following Amelia. 
GEORGE She probably meant me. So honest, the words confuse her. 
ELINOR Obviously, she doesn't see me as a threat. 
GEORGE Oh, sure she does. A straight smile... 
GEORGE (CONT'D) She just doesn't care. ...which silently fades.

LONG ANGLE. Sophisticated watering hole. Crowded tonight. PAN to find George alone, waiting. A waiter leads Amelia to the table. George stands, smiling. But the smile is not returned. We CLOSE as they sit... 
GEORGE 
A hat's wrong? MELIA (clearly furious) What could be wrong? I had such a lovely afternoon with Elinor Smith. Oh. 
GEORGE he told you that I shut her out of the Derby. And that's true. 
AMELIA And when were you going to tell me? GEORGE (calm, straight) Never. I knew you'd go crazy. And I felt it needed to be done. She can scarcely believe this. 
AMELIA What? You think I wanted it done, but just let you do the dirty work? 
GEORGE I didn't say that. 
AMELIA Because I'm no angel. Business is competition and competition is rough, and I thank my stars that you're there making this life happen for me, but... 
GEORGE ou're making your life hap... 
AMELIA But this is different. It is.

AMELIA (CONT'D) And when we're married, you mustn't ever... Now she stops.      Because his eyes are wide. 
AMELIA (CONT'D) What's the big shock? I thought you wanted to get married. Full beat. 
GEORGE did.   I do. 
AMELIA Well, then. His eyes moving over her face. 
GEORGE What about what you said? The day S            will come when you run away. he nods.    It will. 
AMELIA You'll be destroyed. And part of me will, too. And I think we both know it. And yet. 
AMELIA (CONT'D) Sometimes things happen that way. You're not better safe than sorry. Tears stand in his eyes.       He is so happy. 
AMELIA (a whisper) (CONT'D) Yes? GEORGE (a whisper) Hell yes. 
A reaches now, starts REPACKING her soil... 
MELIA (CONT'D) But you don't think that, do you, ear? 
GEORGE Of course not. But if I did... She SMACKS his hand. He just keeps working. She finally grins, smacks him HARDER. He doesn't seem to notice. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) ...all the more reason to say yes. 
EXT. TEETERBORO AIRPORT - DUSK 
AERIAL ANGLE. In the sun's last light, two figures walk slowly, far below us. The Vega waits. CLOSE ANGLE. They stand beneath the wing. Her ground crew in far distance, giving them their moment. Her look is not breezy and cavalier this time, but tender and intimate. She knows the fear beneath his easy smile. He produces a RING, a band of black fibers. 
GEORGE Elephant hair, I think you wear it on your toe. It's good luck. He puts it in her hand. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) Anyway. That's what the elephant told me. Amelia looks at the ring.   Turns it in her fingers. 
AMELIA I think luck has rules. And I try to respect them. My favorite is... She glances up. 
AMELIA (CONT'D) We make our own luck, you and I. Remember that. He will remember that.    And more. 
GEORGE Do you have money? 
AMELIA No. He pulls out a twenty dollar bill.      Hands it to her. 
AMELIA (CONT'D) All this? G 
EORGE Sure. 
AMELIA Thank god, I thought you were going to tear it in half. 
GEORGE I spent our money on ocean liner passage to go bring you back. It's non-refundable. So try to do your part. She nods.   She'll try.   He doesn't want to leave her yet. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) So the Simpkin thing. What was all that? 
AMELIA I put it in a letter. Which you'll get if I don't make it. So...mixed emotions, huh? He shakes his head. GEORGE (very soft) Either way, something to look forward to. She puts her hands on his face.    She doesn't want to leave him either. 
AMELIA (murmurs) Stake up the peonies, huh? They're messy when they bloom on the ground, and... And. AMELIA (a whisper) I want to see their heads high. When I come home. She leans up to kiss him. And again.    Feeling in her eyes that he will never forget. 
AMELIA (CONT'D) See ya. 
INT. VEGA - NIGHT 
Amelia alone. Starry night.   12,000 feet below are ICEBERGS. A single fishing boat. 
AMELIA (V.O.) The weather report wasn't perfect. But we knew our real chance was to take weather that others wouldn't. Ahead, towering CLOUDS in moonlight.   Too high to fly over. 
AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D) I closed the deal by choosing May 20, five years to the day from Lindbergh's flight. It was too good a sell for George to resist. 5              What we didn't know...

Amelia fights for control as the plane is TOSSED and SHAKEN. 
AMELIA (V.O.) The only way to have any sense of altitude, was to keep dropping toward the sea. 
(MORE) 
AMELIA(cont'd) When the engines sputtered, that was my low-level limit. A sudden JOLT knocks her OUT of her seat. She scrambles back, as we see WHITECAPS A FEW FEET BELOW. She JERKS the nose UP, the engine COUGHS... ...and CLIMBS. 
AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D) I was too busy to grasp how impossible the situation had become. The joke was... LATER.   Flying in and out of cloud cover. 
AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D) All those months flying only with instruments, I should have been practicing without them. PAN to the windshield. A small GLOW at the surface of a vibrating engine. Amelia hasn't noticed. 
AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D) I started to wonder if luck was paying me back. For thinking I knew the rules. A small BLUE FLAME LICKS out into the night. 
AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D) Then I smelled burning oil. She sees it now. The flame coming through a broken weld in the manifold ring.  A 
MELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D) A bad weld, already a small flame. It would be hours back to Canada, trying to find an unlit field, landing with a heavy fuel load. She stares at the little flame.   Is it growing bigger?

AMELIA (reads) `Using a man-made perfect machine, tuned by men mechanics, trained by men flyers, on a course laid out by a man. By a lucky break she just managed to make the hop.' She stares at the paper.    His voice comes gently... 
GEORGE hy would you even read that garbage? 
AMELIA Well, it reminds me how much I owe to the men of this world. Keeps me humble. 
GEORGE ood. And remembering how little you owe me keeps me humble. And softly... 
GEORGE (CONT'D) He's a crackpot. Let it go. He points to the packed hall... 
GEORGE (CONT'D) Cheer up.     They're crazy about you. AMELIA (quiet) Well, they're crazy about something. She looks down.   Self-doubt flickers. 
AMELIA (CONT'D) What have we really done? 
GEORGE You've made them feel like this. 
AMELIA That's not enough. 
GEORGE Most of them are women. And for them, it's very much enough. She shakes her head. 
AMELIA The World Telegram said, `a magnificent display of useless courage.' 
GEORGE The question is. Can any magnif- icent display of courage be use- less?     A 
MELIA The point is. Men do it every day. And no one throws a parade. Ah.   Well... 
GEORGE One day closer, then. To the day when they won't think to throw one for you. She doesn't turn.   She doesn't smile. 
AMELIA Reasoning with me. A magnificent display of useless courage. He nods to himself. 
GEORGE And.   It's fun. From the stage... 
ANNOUNCER (O.S.) 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THE

GENE I'm rattling on here, and you've got a morning train. But she's just staring in his eyes.   This could be her last chance to ask... 
AMELIA How's Nina doing? 
GENE Oh, fine. Really?   He smiles, gently. 
GENE (CONT'D) Actually, she hasn't been feeling her best. She'll probably summer in Newport. So my kid's stuck with Dad again. 
AMELIA If you two get bored, I could tag along sometimes. 
GENE You suggesting you're less boring than I am? 
AMELIA Well, yeh. He smiles first.    Hers is slower, but here it comes. 
AMELIA (CONT'D) Any given meal, I can eat a lobster and have you boys in stitches. A full beat.    He's deciding. 
GENE Gore would love that. He has a little crush, I'm afraid. 
AMELIA At seven? 
GENE He's eight. Well, then. He breaks the look.     Fishes out some cash for the bar tab.        G 
ENE (CONT'D) Listen, Paul and I would be thrilled to rope you into our shuttle. 
AMELIA Are you kidding, it's a godsend. No matter how hard George and I work, how many lectures we cram in, there's never enough money for the next adventure. He looks at her. Lets the silence sit there.     His eyes seem to convey a depth of understanding. 
GENE The next adventure.    What is it? She shrugs.    No idea. 
GENE (CONT'D) Because we're running out of oceans. 
AMELIA Wish you'd do something about that. 
GENE I'm serious, Amelia. Her soft smile. 
AMELIA I know.   Always. 
GENE The only way you can stay where you are. And be who you are... Serious indeed. 
GENE (CONT'D) Is to keep feeding the beast. She can't smile anymore.     Because this is the very fear she lives with. 
GENE (CONT'D) And the beast always needs something larger, greater, more daring... AMELIA (quiet) He costs money, too. 
GENE The price of fame, literally. Do you and George talk about this? Silence. 
AMELIA We don't have to. 
GENE With all respect.    Yes, you do. 
INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - LATER 
Walking together down the hallway of her hotel. No one speaks. Their thoughts are their own. She reaches her room, finds her key. Opens the door, and... ...turns to him. A brief, direct look.       She reaches one hand gently behind his head. Leans up. 
K isses his mouth. AMELIA (a whisper) Thank you. His eyes question.

INT. BANQUET HALL, WASHINGTON - NIGHT 
Crowded hall, each table ringed by diners in formal dress. At a table of honor, George sits next to Elinor Smith, chatting comfortably. PAN to the head table... 
GEORGE (V.O.) After Roosevelt won, his wife Eleanor brought the advancement of women to national attention with stunning success. CLOSE on ELEANOR ROOSEVELT, eating heartily, chatting, laughing with a companion we don't see until... 
GEORGE (V.O.) (CONT'D) A gutsy gal who rode a bobsled in he Winter Olympics, spent hours each morning on horseback, and carried a pistol on car trips. She possessed boundless energy, a towering intellect... ...we reveal Amelia in a formal satin dress at her side, dishing with the First Lady like the closest of girlfriends. 
EXT. GARDEN, RYE - DAY 
Amelia on her knees, tending to her garden. She seems happy and filled with energy. George comes and kneels beside her. Starts weeding. 
AMELIA Have I told you what a perfect job ou did on the peonies? They're miraculous. 
M

GEORGE (working) You have, actually. Twice. 
AMELIA Sorry. 
GEORGE It's all right. You've been distracted lately. No spin on that.   If G anything, the tone is kind. 
EORGE (CONT'D) Listen, I've put together a month n Europe. Close some foreign licensing deals, open new markets... She doesn't look up. 
AMELIA When are you leaving? 
GEORGE Thing is.     I'd like you to come. She stiffens only slightly.     Can he sense it? 
AMELIA I don't really see how I can. 
GEORGE I've talked to the promoters, they'll switch some lecture dates for us. Now he's looking at her profile.     Saddened, if not surprised, by what he sees. 
AMELIA Well, it's not just that. There's y work on the shuttle, we're at a critical stage, and...I've just started as Gene's consultant at the Aeronautics Branch... She knows he's watching.    Shakes her head.    Keeps on working. 
GEORGE Normally, I'd be worried about leaving you here alone. But I suppose that won't be a problem, will it? She stops now. Looks up at him.      If he wants a direct conversation, he can have it. 
B 
AMELIA What are you trying to say? 
GEORGE I think I've just said it. A long held look.       Neither backing away.   Sadness on both sides. GEORGE (softly) Is there anything you want to say? She sighs.       Her fingers reach out, rub his hand with affection. 
AMELIA I can't think of anything helpful. He nods.   Well, then.      Rises slowly... Walks back toward the house, his garden tools forgotten.          She stares after him. 
H e disappears into the house.       She's still staring.

EXT. LOS ANGELES COLISEUM - DAY 
MOVIETONE NEWSREEL FOOTAGE introduced by its theme. A stadium in brilliant sunlight, filled with more than 100,000 people. 
ANNOUNCER (O.S.) Los Angeles, California. The Tenth Olympics of the modern era kick off, as movie stars mingle with ordinary Joes. On the track, WOMEN RUN the 100 meter high hurdles as every throat CHEERS. 
ANNOUNCER (O.S.) (CONT'D) Here's the gold medal run of the world's best woman athlete, abe Didrickson. Cheered on by the most celebrated woman of today... TIGHT INSERT of Amelia with Gene and 8-year-old GORE, all applauding excitedly.

ANNOUNCER (O.S.) (CONT'D) ...that's right, Amelia Earhart. Hollywood glamor, American winners, and wait til our boys warm up for their action. The camera lingers as Amelia says something to Gore.     They look like a family. 
INT. GEORGE'S OFFICE, NEW YORK - DUSK 
CLOSE on George alone in his office.    He goes to the door, LOCKS it. His face is drawn, grim. 
EORGE (V.O.) By this time, I had a side job as chairman of the editorial board of Paramount Pictures. So Amelia and I bought a little place in Los Angeles. He goes slowly back to his desk.   On it, sits a large cardboard CARTON. 
EORGE (V.O.) She was out there, preparing for a flight, when our home in Rye burned to the ground. We SEE that the contents of the box, papers, small objects, have been SINGED or CHARRED. He stares into it. 
GEORGE (V.O.) We both cried when I called to tell her. She asked to come be with me. But I insisted she stay there, to keep on schedule for her flight. He reaches into the box... 
GEORGE (V.O.) So many treasures lost. Letters and poems she'd written. I poured through the rubble... 
INT. LOS ANGELES HOME - DAY 
Amelia curled up on the sofa of a cozy, pleasant little home. The doors are open to the patio and yard. Winter is different here. Tropical flowers, fruit trees in bloom. The phone RINGS and she picks it up quickly, knowing it's George. 
G 
A 
AMELIA(cont'd) me to build a women's careers department there. Really?   He likes that. 
AMELIA (CONT'D) I'll be back and forth. When I'm there, I've asked to stay in the dorm with the girls. 
GENE That's a wonderful idea. Especially now. Something in the way he said that. 
AMELIA What's special about now? 
GENE A good time for some positive press about you as a role model. Her eyes harden.   Whatever do you mean? 
GENE (CONT'D) You don't read the papers? 
AMELIA Not unless someone makes me. 
GENE Well, someone should. Because they're all saying you took recklessly dangerous solo flights for no earthly purpose except publicity. Meaning, money. Dead.   Silence.     G 
ENE (CONT'D) They also harp on a growing list of products that you commercially endorse.

AMELIA If this is about George, just say o. Because we made those calls, nd we includes me. 
GENE I'm sorry I said it that way. This s actually about you, because I'm picking a fight, apparently a useless one, for the benefit of someone I care about. 
AMELIA And what's your point? Women are eld to some higher standard? Bankers and industrialists are ad- mired for succeeding, but women are just considered selfish and grasping? ENE (quietly) Of course they are. 
AMELIA Well, let's change that, shall we? r would you just prefer to adopt t, since groveling would be easier. Staring at each other. 
GENE If you want to make money, my guess s that people viewing you as Lady Lindy, America's Sweetheart of the Skies, the wife/mother/daughter they all wished they had. Would be helpful. 
AMELIA Thanks for the tip. 
GENE Thanks for not being defensive. Full beat.

AMELIA Well, I'm an open-minded girl. And o prove it, I'm hereby resigning as your consultant at the S            Aeronautics Branch. he throws some money on the table for the drinks.

EXT. ROSE GARDEN, WHITE HOUSE - DAY 
MOVIETONE NEWSREEL FOOTAGE introduced by its theme. Against a backdrop of flowerbeds, Amelia is flanked by four WOMEN with conservative hats and middle-aged gravitas. The photographers edge closer. 
AMELIA I came to Washington today with the National Women's Party, to ask the President for his aid in passing the Lucretia Mott Amendment for equal rights. She waits for the press to quiet. 
AMELIA (CONT'D) And that's because I haven't needed it. The winsome smile. 
AMELIA And your surprise is, you robbed a bank. 
GEORGE Actually.    A university. They stop.    What on earth...? 
GEORGE (CONT'D) I've sort of persuaded Ed Elliot to create an Amelia Earhart Fund for Aeronautical Research at Purdue. And suggested a budget item of... He shrugs. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) ...oh, eighty grand. For a suitable `flying laboratory.' Her eyes just bug out.      No!   He nods, slowly.   Uh-huh.   And she... ...THROWS her arms around his neck, KISSING him hard enough 
G to startle passersby. It only makes him chuckle. 
EORGE (CONT'D) As I said, I've sort of persuaded Ed. There are a bunch of trustees and donors, tho. We have to get them on board. 
AMELIA Think I could help? He looks in her eyes. 
GEORGE Nah. She grins. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) By the way. That's not the surprise. It's not?    Uh-uh.   And he glances to... ...the window of the GALLERY they've stopped at. She sees a magnificently carved CHEST. On a crest in the front: AE. We PAN the surface, to see planes, oceans, a shamrock for the Londonderry landing, dozens more symbols of her triumphs, and in a bottom corner, looking up at all of this in wonder... ...a small cat.     In a long frock coat. GEORGE (a whisper) Merry Christmas. Her tears just come. She's standing on Park Avenue and she can't do anything about it. He reaches a tender hand... ...and strokes her hair.      He is her hero.   See it in her eyes.

INT. DINING ROOM, PURDUE UNIVERSITY - NIGHT 
A glittering table surrounded by high rollers. George and President Elliot sit on either side of Amelia, who has risen to speak. 
AMELIA As President Elliot has said, it would be a shining adventure, beckoning with new experiences. Making me more useful to the program here at Purdue. She looks into the eyes of each in turn... 
AMELIA (CONT'D) It is much more. I believe that women should do for themselves what men have done - and occasionally what men have not. Yes? 
AMELIA (CONT'D) This might encourage other women toward greater independence of thought and action. And I know how deeply you gentlemen desire that. There is gentle laughter.   Amelia reacts in mock surprise. 
AMELIA (CONT'D) I know, of course, from my chats earlier in the evening. With each of your wives. More laughter.   Applause from a wife, then the others, then all. 
AMELIA (CONT'D) In that spirit, I want each of you to reach for your checkbooks... She regards their amusement.   And losing none of the warmth of her own smile... 
AMELIA (CONT'D) I mean that quite literally. This is an opportunity for me to exhibit the quality my husband admires most.

INT. HANGAR - DAY 
The LOCKHEED ELECTRA, a sleek state-of-the-art aircraft with its gleaming metallic surface, nose up in the center of a huge space. Its engines are on hoists, being worked on by a team of MECHANICS. Eight-year-old Gore gazes up, as if he has never seen anything quite so wondrous. Amelia and Gene watch, with barely suppressed smiles. He's in a suit. She's in grease- stained overalls from working with the mechanics. 
GORE So you'd be the first one, right? ou always like that. First one? 
GORE (CONT'D) To fly around the world. 
AMELIA Well, there's Magellan, 400 years go. Actually, he didn't make it. And he died. And he used a boat. 
GORE So it's almost the same, except it's completely different. 
AMELIA Pretty much. He glowers at her.    She glowers back. 
GENE (CONT'D) This is Howland Island. It's half- way between Honolulu and New Guinea. It has no elevation, no trees, it's a mile wide and a mile and a half long. Hardly anyone knows or cares that it exists. 
AMELIA It's your vacation home. 
GENE We're colonizing it, because when the Japanese make their move, we're going to need a refueling strip there. She blinks.   The Japanese. 
GENE (CONT'D) Try reading the newspapers between he lines. We haven't started building the runways yet. Maybe if someone I knew could get the President's attention... She stares at the map.   The dot. 
GENE (CONT'D) It's really tiny, a grain of sand n the middle of a thousand miles f nowhere. Her eyes are clicking through a calculus of their own. 
GENE (CONT'D) 
F You'd need a first-class navigator or that leg. Which means the trip can't be entirely solo. And softly... 
GENE (CONT'D) Can you handle that? 
T 
No answer.       He waits without saying a word. AMELIA (softly back) Don't rush me. I'm thinking. 
EXT. COAST GUARD STATION, LOS ANGELES - MORNING 
A Coast Guard station overlooking the Pacific. A lone woman leans on a railing. From the station, a MAN emerges, he has... ...a thermos and two large mugs. He pours steaming coffee into each, and brings them to the woman at the rail. She has turned to study him as he approaches. 
AMELIA Hullo, Fred. It's good to meet you. She holds out her hand. He juggles the mugs, so he can shake it. Strong look in each other's eyes. Hands her a mug... 
FRED I hear you like your coffee black. 
AMELIA This time of day, I like it with bacon and eggs. His slight grin.       A handsome guy. 
FRED Be right back. 
AMELIA Over easy on the eggs.      Your job could depend on it. Silence between them.       Comfortable smiles. 
FRED Are we sizing me up? And, of course, this is exactly what she's doing. 
AMELIA I'm told that mid-air refueling would be beyond my abilities. 
FRED Maybe, maybe not. 20% it works. 0% you crash. 60% you don't get he fuel, so you're cooked anyway.

RED How do you feel about 100%? Watching his eyes as he says that.    Evaluating. 
AMELIA Even with cloud cover? 
FRED I've crossed the Pacific by air 18 times. Pan Am told you I'm the best celestial navigator they've ever seen. 
AMELIA They did. 
FRED Someone else told you I have a drinking problem. Which is a big art of why we're here, yes? No answer. 
FRED (CONT'D) Pan Am will tell you. Everyone I ver worked for will tell you. Nothing's interfered with my performance. Not once. 
AMELIA My dad drank. He lied all the time. Rest his soul. 
FRED You trusted Bill Stultz. That worked out. Rest his soul. 
AMELIA Bill just had to find Europe. We're looking for something less than two miles long, with nothing higher on it than 18 feet. He shakes his head. 
FRED That's what you're looking for. I'm looking for coordinates on a map. And if it doesn't work... He spreads his large hands...

FRED (CONT'D) Money-back guarantee. She holds the look. AMELIA (softly) Hey.   How can I lose? 
he looks wildly around to... ..George, who's there, SNATCHING the receiver. 
VOICE (O.S.) Have you heard? They crashed, the ship's in flames. SMASH CUT to the cockpit, the Electra SPINNING crazily on its belly, SPARKS EVERYWHERE, the plane suddenly comes... ...to a BONE-JARRING STOP. The right MOTOR is pushed up INTO its wing, which itself has BUCKLED, the stabilizer BENT, the left wing extends UPWARD from scraping the runway, the landing gear no longer exists. SIRENS SCREAM as fire trucks and ambulances race toward them. Amelia is ashen, disbelieving. Next to her, a gentle... 
FRED Good reaction, cutting the switch. You saved our ass. She doesn't even hear, THROWING open the cockpit, WAVING to signal they're all right, we SMASH CUT TO...

EXT. GARDEN, LOS ANGELES HOME - ALMOST SUNRISE 
Two figures in a garden, walking in light so spare they are silhouettes. Her head is down. His hands are in his pockets. We CLOSE on them as she fingers a blossom, we now see she is miserable, fighting absolute despair. 
GEORGE Three weeks, she'll be good as new. It's a remarkable crew. The best 
T hat... He stops.   Realizing where he was going.   She never looks up. 
AMELIA ...the best that money can buy. I just can't believe I've done this o us. All the money wasted that's never coming back. 
GEORGE You cut the engines. It would have cost a bundle more to replace a burned-up plane. Not to mention pilot. She shakes her head.    No. 
AMELIA I overreacted. The plane was too heavy, I should have used the rudder pedal instead of the throttle. Tears stand in her eyes. She is so ashamed and remorseful. He lets it stay silent as they walk. Then... 
GEORGE t's only money, we'll figure it out. We always do. 
AMELIA I'll make it back and more, I promise. The book sales, the lectures, this flight will keep us going another three years. 
GEORGE Maybe.   Or... 
AMELIA No, it will. Our prices, our sales, are going to double.

AMELIA You mean after. 
GEORGE Or.     Even now. A strong smile.    He nods.     We could. 
AMELIA So my exit would be a stupid crash. nd withdrawing from a world- publicized attempt to finally do something no man had done before. 
GEORGE Yeh. That. And it would be fine ith me. Her eyes overwhelmed A his offer. by                  Her voice soft with... 
MELIA But that's because you're an idiot. 
GEORGE Lucky for you. A held beat.

AMELIA I'll try to make you proud. 
GEORGE You did that long, long ago. Only ne person left to prove yourself o. Just make sure you do it. 
A beat.   The doubt comes. 
AMELIA And then what? 
GEORGE Then the best part.    The future. She stares in his eyes.       Leans to him. AMELIA (a whisper) Oh yeh.    That. She brings her hands to his face. Her mouth to his.      Deep. Longing. Her body sinks into him. LONG ANGLE.      Two alone.   Only each other. 
EXT. MIAMI AIRPORT - DAY 
LONG ANGLE. From the open door of a hangar we see Amelia and George facing reporters in front of the idling Electra. She sits on the wing, he's just beneath her. 
GEORGE (V.O.) The radio problems crept up on us ver time. 
SUPERIMPOSE:      MIAMI AIRPORT.   JUNE 1. 
GEORGE (V.O.) (CONT'D) The marine 500 kilocycle radio was left in Oakland. Amelia said she

C 
GEORGE(cont'd) and Fred were both amateurs at Morse Code, so the radio wasn't worth what it weighed. Amelia has made the boys laugh.    George laughs with them. 
GEORGE (V.O.) (CONT'D) The 250 foot trailing auxiliary antenna, she would leave behind in Miami. Too heavy, not important. FLASHES now. And plenty of them. She reaches down to take George's hand and HOPS down from the wing. More FLASHES... 
GEORGE (V.O.) (CONT'D) Then, suddenly our remaining radio ouldn't reach its designated frequencies. Pan Am hurriedly replaced the main antennae. And we thought all was well. Amelia and George coming toward us now, hand in hand, leaving the press behind. Into... The hangar. In shadow here.     The world far away, she takes his hands. A silence. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) Race you to California. I'll go west. Five bucks? 
AMELIA If you'll fly the plane.   Make it twenty. And then... 
AMELIA (CONT'D) Simpkin keeps many mice at one time. Each under a different teacup. Wow.   He's finally going to hear this. 
GEORGE We're saying he's cruel? 
AMELIA No. 
GEORGE Controlling? 
AMELIA Insecure.

Ah.   The light begins to dawn. 
AMELIA (CONT'D) He needs the illusion of activity o feel comfortable. That he's preparing for all contingencies. George has to grin. 
AMELIA (CONT'D) That he has more irons in the 
F ire than anyone knows. 
GEORGE Especially the mice. 
AMELIA Exactly. Each poor mouse thinks it's all about her. Staring at each other. 
GEORGE And one of them.    Is right. AMELIA (a murmur) She knows. And then... 
GEORGE want you to give me something. He's never sounded quite like this before. 
EXT. ELECTRA - LATER 
A wrenching battle, plane versus monsoon. The storm is heavier, deafening, actually STRIPPING PAINT from the Electra's wings. 
INT. ELECTRA - SAME MOMENT 
Amelia beyond exhaustion, but focused, fighting it.      We think she's flying alone. Until... ...Fred drops into the seat beside her. No words as he watches her struggle. Our plane is all over the sky. The DIN is ungodly. 
AMELIA

FRED 
NOPE.     I THINK WE SHOULDN'T HAVE 
COME. An AIR POCKET DROPS them 200 feet.

INT. ELECTRA - DAY 
Amelia flying down through heavy turbulence, though it is no longer raining. Her features tense. We see the accumulated strain of the adventure. 
F red appears from the catwalk, slips into the seat beside her. He's worried. Points, and we see... ...CALCUTTA below, sprawling and endless. Between us and the ground, a huge gathering of FLYING SHAPES. 
RED Black eagles. If one of those clips a propeller. Or flies into the engine... Her tired features form a smile. 
AMELIA 've got an idea. Let's never land. Better safe than sorry. He takes her point.    She turns back to work... 
AMELIA (CONT'D) I'll wake you when the coffee's ready. And with cold-blooded nerve, she SWOOPS down, down, THROUGH the flock of eagles, scattering them as we arc in for a perfect landing. She never turns to... ...Fred, who is still white-knuckling, trying to get his heart started. He can't believe what she's just done. Rolling, rolling... 
FRED Cream, no sugar.

BALFOUR Ready, Mum. He stands and she takes his seat. He shows her the key to press, then steps back toward the window. But she makes no move to the radio. Just stares at him. He doesn't understand. AMELIA (gently) Feel like stepping out for a smoke...? 
BALFOUR I don't smoke. 
AMELIA ...or something? Oh.   The monsoon beats down. 
BALFOUR If you need help, I'll be right outside. In the rain.

INTERCUT:   COAST GUARD STATION, LOS ANGELES - DAY 
George at a window, looking west.     Over the Pacific.   She's there somewhere. 
EORGE You should be sleeping. He smiles to keep his voice up. The eyes aren't smiling.       We INTERCUT their conversation throughout... 
AMELIA You should be working. 
GEORGE I'm running a big adventure here, 'm a very important fellow. 
AMELIA You told me I was the star.   And you were no one at all. GEORGE (soft) I thought I was lying. Guess the joke's on me. Silence. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) How's Fred? 
AMELIA I'm mad at him. I'll be in Honolulu on the 3rd, and with you in Oakland for Fourth of July. Okay? 
GEORGE Don't keep me waiting. 
AMELIA I won't dare. You're a very important feline. Uh, fellow. 
GEORGE Talk to me about Fred. 
AMELIA Fred is fine. He's calculating head-wind speed versus fuel as we speak. CLOSE on his face. 
GEORGE You wouldn't sell a salesman would you? 
AMELIA He's fine. 
GEORGE So what's that I hear in     your voice? A beat. 
GEORGE Is he drinking? AMELIA (soft) I can handle it. 
GEORGE Call it off. Right now.      I mean it. 
AMELIA I can handle it. And then... 
AMELIA I love you. Silence. 
GEORGE After the Fourth.     We're going home.

EXT. HOWLAND ISLAND - DAY 
ERIAL ANGLE. A tiny, flat, nearly invisible speck adrift in the endless Pacific. Howland Island. PAN to see just offshore... 
GEORGE (V.O.) The U.S. Coast Guard cutter Itasca had been anchored off Howland just for us. CLOSE on the ITASCA now... 
GEORGE (V.O.) (CONT'D) Its radio would be her lifeline. Its black plume of smoke would reach for miles. More visible than the island itself. DISSOLVE TO NIGHT. The island visible only by its slender LIGHTHOUSE. The ship illuminated in the darkness. CLOSE now on a path by the sea. A lone figure with a FLASHLIGHT approaches a SHACK. Enters...

INT. RADIO ROOM, ITASCA - NIGHT 
The room is 9 x 20 with bare walls. At the transmitter, LEO BELLARTS the chief radio man. Short and square, an unflappable air of quiet expertise. With him, his assistant WILLIAM DALTEN, lean and young with dark serious eyes. At a typewriter sits THOMAS O'HARE, barely twenty, headphones across his shock of rust-colored hair, telegraph at the ready.

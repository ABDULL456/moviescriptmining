A1INT. CADEN AND ADELE'S BEDROOM - FALL 2005 - MORNING A1 
Darkness. The sound of a radio and pots and pans clanging fades in. Caden, 40, opens his eyes in bed, and groggily looks at himself in the bureau mirror. The bedside clock reads 7:45. 
1 INT. CADEN AND ADELE'S KITCHEN - FALL 2005 - SAME1 
Adele, 40, in t-shirt and sweats, mixes a bowl of instant oatmeal, puts it in the microwave.

ADELECADEN (O.S.) Caden, could you get that? It's Maria. I don't want to. 
ADELE Ugh. Caden! (looks at bright green smear on toilet paper) That's weird. The phone stops ringing.

ADELE Hey.

ADELE (CONT'D) You're kidding! Holy fuck! Caden exits with his coffee, annoyed about the phone call. 
CADEN I don't feel well. 
4 INT. CADEN AND ADELE'S BATHROOM - FALL 2005 - CONTINUOUS 4 
Caden passes the bathroom. Olive is staring into the toilet bowl. Adele can be heard chatting in the background. 
OLIVE Daddy, my poop is green. Caden enters the bathroom, looks into the bowl at the green feces and smeared toilet paper. He seems freaked out.

5EXT. CADEN AND ADELE'S HOUSE - FALL 2005 - MORNING 5 
Caden steps out the front door in his bare feet and hurries down the driveway in the rain. He picks up the newspaper, pulls the mail from the box. As he heads back inside, he flips through the mail. There's a magazine called Attending to your Illness addressed to Caden. A diseased person on the cover. Across the street a gaunt man watches Caden, unseen. 
6INT. CADEN AND ADELE'S KITCHEN - FALL 2005 - MORNING 6 
Caden sits at the kitchen table with his coffee, reading the paper, dated Friday, October 14, 2005.

CADEN Oh. The doctor stares blankly at Caden for a long moment, then looks suspiciously in Caden's ears. 
10INT. CADEN AND ADELE'S CAR - WINTER 2006 - NIGHT 10 
Adele drives and coughs spasmodically. The car swerves a bit. Caden has a bandaged head and a prescription in his hand. Olive, in her car seat, sings. Caden sees revelers in winter coats and party hats outside a house. They blow noisemakers and yell "happy new year!" 
OLIVE 
(SINGING) It's a beautiful day and the sun is shining and yellow. And the world is too big to understand and today is Tuesday and -- 
(SPEAKING) Mom, is today Tuesday? 
ADELE No, it's Friday, honey. 
OLIVE 
(SINGING) And today is Friday and... Olive's singing continues but goes under. 
ADELE So what exactly did he say?

ADELE What's wrong, baby? 
OLIVE (hushed anxious whisper) Every-single-where? 
CADEN It's okay. They just carry water to and from sinks and bathtubs and toilets. It's like in your body you have veins and ... um... 
ADELE Capillaries. 
CADEN And they're filled with blood. Olive is crying in earnest now.

DAVID I think fifteen. 
CADEN Why don't you get cleaned up, Tom, and we'll go again. Tom exits. Caden rubs his temples, then heads to the back of the house, pulling out his cell phone. He exits the theater. 
13 INT. SCHENECTADY THEATER LOBBY - 2006 - DAY 13 
Caden passes the box office. Hazel, 35, sits inside, reading a novel. She looks up, smiles warmly, and waves. 
HAZEL I just heard the death of the salesman.

15 INT. SCHENECTADY THEATER BOX OFFICE - 2006 - CONTINUOUS 15 
Hazel reads the first page of Swann's Way. The other volumes of In Search of Lost Time are stacked neatly nearby. She looks up and sees Caden standing outside the box office window watching her. 
HAZEL I keep reading the first line. It's a good line, I think. But I don't know much about literature. 
CADEN Maybe you should read the first line of another series of books. 
HAZEL I'm trying to better myself, Caden. Recommend me something. You're a genius; you must've read nearly a dozen books. 
CADEN Exactly twelve. Have you read Kafka?

CADEN I hope you like it. 
HAZEL It's pretty impossible that I won't, you know. I mean... She trails off, shrugs. They smile at each other. Caden exits. Hazel looks at her book, re-reads the first sentence. 
16 INT. CADEN AND ADELE'S BATHROOM - 2006 - NIGHT 16 
Caden sits on the toilet. He finishes, looks in the bowl. His bowel movement is dark and loose.

22INT. SCHENECTADY THEATER - 2006 - NIGHT 22 
The theater is full. Caden stands nervously in the back. The lights dim. Hazel looks back from her seat at Caden and mouths the word "yay." He smiles. The curtain rises on a dark stage. Tom, as Willy, gets out of the car parked center stage and walks into the kitchen. 
TOM (AS WILLY) Oh boy, oh boy. 
CLAIRE (AS LINDA) Willy! 
TOM (AS WILLY) It's all right, I came back.

CADEN I'll be around. I'll check in. She gets teary, gives him a kiss on the cheek. 
CLAIRE God, I'm such a baby. She just looks at him and smiles and nods. 
CLAIRE (CONT'D) I'm going to get drunk, that's what. 
CADEN Ok, Claire. She backs away and gets lost in the crowd. Caden massages his temples. Suddenly Hazel is next to him. 
HAZEL I figured I'd better get in fast.

CADEN It's pustules. It's called sycosis. Spelled differently than psychosis, but it sounds the same. 
OLIVE I don't know what that means.

SAMMY Jeremy is playing to us. Tell him he simply needs to talk to Donna. We'll hear what we hear. Tammy takes down the note. 
CADEN Sammy's explaining too much. Feels expository. Needs to be shorthand, like, "Jeremy big." Hazel writes that down. They all continue down the hall. 
TAMMY Caden? Can we stop for a second? 
CADEN Sure. 
TAMMY If Hazel's in love with Sammy and Caden's in love with Hazel, there would be a dramatic confrontation, where Caden turns to me and says, "It's obvious he's a substitute for me." I think then Hazel could have a good moment where she cries or gets angry. I'm not sure which yet, but it feels dramatically sound. 
HAZEL That didn't happen, Caden. 
TAMMY I think Hazel would do that, Hazel. 
HAZEL But Hazel hasn't done it, Tammy.

TAMMYCADEN Caden? What do you think?I think we could try it. 
TAMMYHAZEL Great!Fuck. I'm going out for a smoke. They watch her go. Caden turns back to the others. 
CADEN Let's try it. Maybe it could happen at the director's table. 
163EXT. CITY STREET (INT. WAREHOUSE SET) - 2032 - DAY 163 
Caden and Hazel sit at the director's table. The street life of the play is going on around them. 
CADEN Tammy was right. I don't understand why you're with Sammy. 
HAZEL He's nice. He's available. He fucks me without crying. 
CADEN That happened one time! You fucked him? 
HAZEL Yes! And you and I only fucked one time that's why you only cried one time! I give you endless opportunities. 
CADEN What do you mean, he's available? Since when are you available? 
HAZEL Derek left. Because of you! 
CADEN When? How come you never told me? 
HAZEL I don't know, Caden. How come a lot of things? It's not like we can start fresh, like Sammy and I can. There's all this pressure on us. We're finally both free and there's all this fucking pressure.

HAZEL That's such a romantic response. I'm touched. 
CADEN It's not my response. It just crossed my mind. We have enormous budgetary concerns here. 
HAZEL Ugh. Forget it. (looking in book) Derek is played by Joe -- 
CADENHAZEL Stop, okay. Just stop. I don't like Tammy and she's nothing like me. How can you like her? Joe Abernathy. 
CADEN This is the wrong key, Sandy. 
OLD PERSON #2 It isnÃ¢â¬â¢t. Caden bangs on the door. 
CADEN Adele! Adele, are you in there? 
OLD PERSON #1 Maybe itÃ¢â¬â¢s the wrong key. 
CADEN Adele? 
HAZEL Caden, there's no one in there. You've got to let go of her. She's not here anymore. I'm here.

166 EXT. HOTEL STREET (INT. WAREHOUSE SET) - 2032 - DAY 166 
Caden and Hazel walk past the set of the hotel she had stayed at with her family. 
CADEN Look familiar? 
HAZEL Oh my God! It's an exact replica of the Tethered Maiden Terrace! Derek and the kids and I had so much fun on that trip! 
CADEN Listen, I built this because I wanted to show you what happened -- 
SAMMY 
(CALLING) After me, Caden, there's no one left to watch you. They look up. Sammy stands on the ledge above them. 
HAZEL SAMMY (running off) There's nothing to talk Oh fuck! Sammy, Just stay about, Hazel! This is not right where you are! I'myour fault! 
coming up! 
CADEN No fair, Sammy! She wouldn't see you jump. She never saw me! You're not being authentic. 
SAMMY This is where we part ways. This is authentic. This is what the real Caden would do. This is what real love looks like. Sammy leaps. The actors below scatter. Sammy hits hard, breaks through the fake cement, and is dead. Blood everywhere. 
167 EXT. NYC CEMETERY - 2032 - DAY167 
Sammy is buried. An enormous crowd there: all the actors from the play, Caden and Hazel in front. Hazel weeps. Caden looks at the assembled group, from face to face.

CADEN I know how to do it now. There are nearly thirteen million people in the world. Try to imagine that many people! None of those people is an extra. They're all the leads of their own stories. They have to be given their due. 
168 INT. WAREHOUSE - CEMETERY SET - 2035 - DAY168 
The actor playing Sammy is in the coffin. There's an enormous crowd. Tammy plays Hazel and weeps. A stand-in for Sammy as Caden stands next to her. Caden and Hazel watch from the director's table. 
CADEN Do you see what I'm saying? Hazel has her head in her hands. She looks over at Caden, imploringly. 
HAZEL Come over tonight? Please?

170 INT. BURNING HOUSE - BEDROOM - 2035 - NIGHT 170 
The smoke is thick and there are flames. Hazel, in a robe, walks around lighting candles. Caden unpacks his pumps and monitors and places them next to the bed. 
CADEN We could get a place together. We could get a loft. 
HAZEL God, Caden, that sounds nice. I miss my daughter. Maybe she could come live with us. 
CADEN Yeah. I miss Olive. And the other one. The retarded one. 
HAZEL I'm a bad person.

CADEN You can't cause someone to kill himself. He was troubled. 
HAZEL I'm so ashamed of myself. Caden walks over to her and touches her shoulder. 
HAZEL (CONT'D) Oh, Caden. I wish we had this when we were young. And all the years in between. So many years, so fast. 
(CRYING) What did we do? Caden kisses Hazel's forehead. She coughs and smiles up at him, then cranes her neck and kisses him on the lips. 
CADEN My heart aches so much for you. 
HAZEL We're here, Caden. I'm here. 
CADEN I'm aching for it being over. 
OLIVE Of course. She introduced me to myself. To my vagina and to hers. 
CADEN You have no idea how evil she is. 
OLIVE I need to forgive you before I die, but I can't forgive someone who has not asked for forgiveness. 
CADEN 
I -- 
OLIVE I have no time! I need you to ask for forgiveness! 
CADEN (long pause) Can you ever forgive me? 
OLIVE For what? 
CADEN For abandoning you. 
OLIVE "For abandoning you to have anal sex with my homosexual lover Eric." 
CADEN For abandoning you to be have anal sex with my homosexual lover Eric. 
OLIVE (long hesitation) No. No, I'm sorry, I cannot. Olive dies. Dead flower petals slip from her hospital gown. Caden sits there. Maria hurries rushes to Olive's side. 
MARIA I hope you're happy, faggot. Caden gets up and leaves. 
SYN, NY - GOLDENROD REVISIONS - JULY 30, 2007115. 
175 EXT. NYC STREET - SUMMER 2045 - DAY175 
It's sweltering. Caden sits on his stoop, holding some dead flower petals, watching the world pass by. People are sick, angry. Some people wear gas masks. Government vehicles with strange symbols and gun turrets drive by. A woman walks a naked man on a leash. He defecates on the sidewalk. A wild- eyed man in a white t-shirt and Santa hat attacks Caden. As he knocks Caden to the ground and wrestles with him, Caden sees the t-shirt has a little dot: a painting from Adele's show. It's a moment in time, a street scene very much like the one Caden's in. In the painting, a man in a white t- shirt and Santa hat beats up a man who looks like Caden. The flower petals blow away. Caden tries to limp after them. 
176 EXT. NYC STREET - 2045 - DAY 176 
Caden dials his cell phone. 
HAZEL'S ANSWERING MACHINE It's Hazel. Leave a message or don't. Your dime. 
CADEN My love. I know how to do the play. It'll take place over the course of one day. The day will be the day before you died, the happiest day of my life. I'll be able to relive it forever. 
177 EXT. CITY STREET (INT. WAREHOUSE SET) - 2048 - NIGHT 177 
Caden weeps inconsolably at the director's table, Michael the pre-Hazel assistant is back, neat and efficient-looking, but old now. Hazel's dog, Squishy, sleeps on the floor. The scene in the play is dull. People walk back and forth aimlessly. Various passersby on the street have hacking coughs. Tammy steps out of the bathroom, meanders over to the director's table. Hazel's sweater is on Michael's chair- back. She casually pulls it off and tries it on. Caden watches. She looks so much like Hazel now, it's unbearable. He looks away. Millicent walks by carrying a mop and bucket. 
CADEN I need a Caden for my Hazel. 
MILLICENT I... I'd very much like to play Caden. 
CADEN Um...

MILLICENT I know it would be non-traditional casting, but I think I'm right for it. I think I understand Caden. 
CADEN I don't understand him. 
MILLICENT Caden Cotard is a man already dead, living in a half-world between stasis and antistasis. Time is concentrated and chronology confused for him. Up until recently he has strived valiantly to make sense of his situation, but now he has turned to stone. 
CADEN Okay. That sounds good. 
MICHAEL She's right? I didn't see that at all. I saw it all as more hopeful. 
178INT. NYC WIG STORE - 2050 - DAY 178 
Caden and Michael look at a wig called "The Director." 
MICHAEL Any thoughts for today's rehearsal? 
CADEN

MICHAEL Huh. 
CADEN The title is about a lot of things. You'll see. It's about a lot.

183INT. 31Y WALK-IN CLOSET (INT. WAREHOUSE SET) - 2050 - NIGHT 183 
It's dark. Caden lies in bed, attached to his pumps. 
MILLICENT'S VOICE ... miss him. Why did he have to get bored with me? Everyone gets bored with me. I'm not very bright. And since I put on that weight, I don't get the looks I used to. It's not that bad. Lots of people have it worse. I've got a job and place to stay. Adele is nice to me. And so smart and talented. I don't understand her artwork, but that's just me. I wish I'd gone to college. I feel stupid around educated people like Adele. Eric was too smart for me, too. We didn't talk at all near the end.

184INT. ELLEN'S KITCHEN - (2050) - MORNING 184 
A tenement apartment. Ellen, in a terrycloth robe, is at the stove making scrambled eggs. Toast pops from the toaster and Ellen crosses to get it. She passes a mirror, glances at herself, seems momentarily surprised, pushes a wisp of hair behind her ear and continues to the toaster. Eric enters. He's an unhealthily thin middle-aged man. He doesn't acknowledge her, nor she him. He pours himself coffee. 
ELLEN I'm making eggs. 
(BEAT) Is everything okay, Eric? 
ERIC Everything's everything. 
185INT. ELLEN'S BEDROOM - (2050) - MORNING 185 
Ellen sits on the bed with a cup of coffee and stares out the window. There's a city park across the street and she watches kids play basketball. She begins to weep. 
186EXT. FIELD - (2050) - DAY 186 
It's spring and a ten year old girl watches her mother as she lays out a picnic on a blanket on the ground. 
MOTHER Ellen, why do you look so serious? 
ELLEN I'm going to remember this moment for the rest of my life, mama. And in exactly twenty years, come here with my daughter and have exactly the same picnic. 
MOTHER Baby, that's the loveliest thing I've ever heard.

187INT. ELLEN'S BEDROOM - (2050) - NIGHT 187 
Ellen lies in bed watching Eric sleep next to her. 
ELLEN There was supposed to be something else. I was to have something. A calm. A love. Children. A child, at least. Children. Meaning. I am always on the verge, never more than a tiny shove from tears. I can feel them in my chest now. That squeezing pressure. And it is so tempting to let go, but I am afraid, the next time maybe, I will never stop crying. I miss my husband even though he is lying here. He hates me. Oh God. I have disappointed him and he hates me. The one person who should be able to see me and he won't look. He will never look again.

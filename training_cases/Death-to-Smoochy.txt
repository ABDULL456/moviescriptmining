BEGIN CREDITS 
EXT. KIDNET STUDIO -C - EVENING 
A man in a puffy foam-rubber rhinoceros costume dancing under the bright friendly lights of a television studio. Another rhino and various foam-rubber animals dance behind him to the happy MUSIC. The rhino finishes his number and takes a bow. A bleacher full of kids bursts into wild applause. 
INT. BACKSTAGE - MOMENTS LATER 
After the taping. The rhino lumbers down the hallway toward wardrobe. He is suddenly grabbed by two large men and dragged out through the exit into... 
INT. DARK PARKING GARAGE 
... where several   thugs in overcoats emerge from the shadows and start   beating him with lead pipes. One of the men pulls out   a GUN and SHOOTS the rhino several times. The SHOTS    REVERBERATE through the empty garage. FINAL CREDIT: 
CUT TO BLACK: 
SUPERIMPOSE:    ONE YEAR EARLIER 
FADE UP ON: 
INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - DAY 
It's the taping of another children's show -- "Rainbow Randolph and the Krinkle Kids." RANDOLPH SMILEY, a clean-cut man with a happy face and yellow bow tie, dances through Rainbowland with the "Krinkle Kids" (little people in top hats). He sings one of his signature songs: "Friends Come In All Sizes." One of the main Krinkle Kids -- ANGELO PIKE -- dances behind him. 
RANDOLPH (singing) 'Friends come in all sizes That's a fact! It's True! All colors of the rainbow from Mauve to Blue... (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
RANDOLPH (CONT'D) Their names may not be different and their shoes may not match One might say 'grasp' while the other says 'snatch' Some like to toss while others like to caaaaatch... Beeee- caaaause... Friends come in all sizes Take it from me! Golly Gee! Size never matters when you want some friendly patter From a pal who is true and can lift you when you're blue You can count on him and he can count on yoooouuuu! It's true... that... (big finish) Friends come in all sizes!' 
DISSOLVE TO: 
MONTAGE - RAINBOW RANDOLPH MERCHANDISE 
"Sugar Rainbows Cereal," plastic toys lined up on store shelves, kids playing with Randolph dolls, kids eating "Rainbow Potato Chips" and "Rainbow Candies." A "Rainbow Burster," a kind of gun that shoots plastic rainbows. Marquees announcing upcoming live appearances, etc. We get the picture. Rainbow Randolph is the king of the kid shows. 
INT. DIMLY-LIT BAR - NIGHT 
A suburban-looking HUSBAND and WIFE enter. They find Rainbow Randolph sitting alone, drinking a Scotch. Hair slicked back, sans bow tie, the friendly face no longer looks so friendly. He nods for them to sit down. After a nervous beat, the Husband puts a briefcase on the table and slides it to Randolph. Randolph takes a gulp of his Scotch. He unsnaps the briefcase and opens it. Five grand stares him in the face. 
HUSBAND So... uh... you'll make sure my boy dances up front, right? Where he'll get the most camera time? 
Randolph slams the briefcase shut, startling the couple. 
RANDOLPH You want your kid on the show? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
HUSBAND Of... of course. 
WIFE Yes, very much. 
RANDOLPH Then don't tell me how to run my fucking business. 
HUSBAND No, no, we were just -- 
Randolph rises. He takes a final gulp of his Scotch and picks up the briefcase. 
RANDOLPH I'll call you if a spot opens up. 
He starts to walk off. Suddenly, the Husband and Wife jump up from the table holding guns. 
HUSBAND Freeze, you cocksucker! 
WIFE Drop the briefcase! 
Federal agents storm into the bar and surround Randolph. 
EXT. TIMES SQUARE - DAWN 
Bundles of the morning editions are tossed onto the curb from passing trucks.   The various headlines blare: 
"RAINBOW RANDOLPH BUSTED ACCEPTING BRIBE" 
CONTINUED: 
Nora and Stokes watch from the wings with a mixture of uncertainty and disgust. 
DISSOLVE BACK TO: 
WARDROBE ROOM 
A seamstress zips up the back of the finished, redesigned Smoochy costume. Sheldon stands proudly before the design team. Smoochy is now television ready: smoothed out, more colorful, less lumpy and exuding sunshiny happiness. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
STUDIO -C - BACKSTAGE 
Smoochy is about to enter with the Rhinettes.      ANGELO, a former Krinkle Kid, stands beside him. 
SMOOCHY Angelo, you were always my favorite Krinkle Kid. The way you'd click your heels during the 'Jellybean Jam.' Real artistry. I'm honored to have you as a Rhinette. 
ANGELO A job's a job. 
STUDIO -C - PRACTICE TAPING 
Suddenly lights up in all its multi-colored Smoochyland glory. The bleachers are full of children. 
ANNOUNCER (O.S.) Hey, kids! Who's your favorite rhino? 
The kids in the bleachers all scream in unison. 
KIDS Smoochy! 
Smoochy bounds out on stage followed by the Rhinettes who form a dancing circle around him. 
SMOOCHY Hiya, kids! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
KIDS Hi, Smoochy! 
SMOOCHY It's gonna be a fantabulous day in Smoochyland!! 
The kids cheer as Smoochy and the Rhinettes featuring Angelo Pike, go into their "It's a Fantabulous Day in Smoochyland" number -- a catchy, bouncy song and dance routine that plays out in the sugar-coated jungle of Smoochyland. 
SMOOCHY (singing) 'Ohhhh... it's a fantabulous day in Smoochy-land/Let's have a great big cheer for the Smoochy-land band/We'll dance with our jungle pals, won't that be grand/Oh, it's a fantabulous day in Smoochy- land!' 
Smoochy dances right UP TO the CAMERA, FILLING the FRAME with his friendly, puffy face. 
END of prep MONTAGE. 
EXT. DOCK BY RIVER - NIGHT (POURING RAIN) 
A disheveled Randolph paces on a deserted dock. The Brooklyn Bridge looms in the b.g. A car pulls up in the b.g. Stokes gets out. Randolph moves under an awning. 
RANDOLPH I was starting to think that maybe you weren't coming. 
STOKES I agreed to meet you, didn't I?    I had a dinner engagement. 
Randolph takes a swig from a flask. 
RANDOLPH Really? You know, I used to have dinner engagements. Sometimes four, five a night. Dinner... drinks... I was the toast of the fucking town. 
STOKES Don't start, Randolph.   Please. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
RANDOLPH (voice rising) Cars, boats, whores and horses, I had 'em all. When I walked into a restaurant, ten guys reached for my hat. When I stood up to take a piss, they cleared the rest room. I'd walk down the street and traffic stopped, mouths gaped. You know why? You know why, Frank? (now shouting) I was Rainbow fucking Randolph! That's why! 
STOKES Are you through? 
RANDOLPH What? You're in a hurry? You don't have time for me? The guy who earned for you? The guy who put those fucking suits on your back and the pheasant au vin in your Brooklyn mouth? 
STOKES I think it's fair to say we helped each other. 
Randolph suddenly breaks down. 
RANDOLPH (pleading) You gotta fix it, Frank. You gotta get me my slot back. 
He now clings to Stokes' lapels. 
RANDOLPH How can I sit around while that rhinoceros... that horned carpetbagger gets a free ride on my dime? You and I have history, Frank! Please! 
Stokes pries Randolph's hands from his overcoat. 
The kids in the bleachers erupt in unison: 
KIDS Magic Cookie Bag! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
SMOOCHY Right-o-riffic! (looks skyward) Magic Cookie Bag, I command thee! Come to your lord and master! 
The lights dim as the Smoochyland Band plays the "2001 theme." Smoochy's Magic Cookie Bag is lowered from the ceiling by a filament wire. The kids go crazy. 
SMOOCHY (singing) 'Lookie, lookie, lookie, here comes the cookies! Fresh and organic, no need to panic! Right from the soil, no tropical oils! Sweetened with juice, for an energy boost! Fiber galore, you'll be askin' for more...' 
ANGLE ON NORA 
She looks pissed, but then looks over at the kids in the bleachers. Their faces are filled with laughter. For the first time she feels the connection Smoochy has with them. 
ANGLE ON RANDOLPH 
He peers out from his hiding place backstage. His eyes widen with delight as the Magic Cookie Bag continues its descent. 
ANGLE ON SMOOCHY 
The cookie bag finally reaches Smoochy. He holds the bag high above his head in a religious ceremonial fashion as the Rhinettes and the kids crowd around him. 
SMOOCHY Oooh... just the smell of unprocessed flour makes my tummy do somersaults! 
ANGLE ON RANDOLPH 
RANDOLPH (under his breath) Whatever that means, you fucking retard. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
SMOOCHY 
His puffy orange hand reaches for the bag's clasp as the MUSIC reaches its CRESCENDO. 
RANDOLPH 
He's practically shaking as he suppresses an insane laugh. 
RANDOLPH Give 'em a cookie... give 'em a cookie... 
SMOOCHY 
He reaches into the bag, and with a grand flourish, pulls out a flaming red penis cookie. The cookie is somewhat misshapen and not perfectly formed. Smoochy gets a big grin. 
SMOOCHY Wow! Look at this cookie, kids! A rocket ship! 
The kids "ooh" and "ahh." 
ANGLE ON RANDOLPH 
He looks confused. 
SHELDON What a special day with such special cookies! 
BACK ON SMOOCHY 
Smoochy pretends to "zoom" the penis cookie through the air. 
SHELDON Rrrrrrrr! Look at me, kids! I'm flying to the moon! I'm flying to Mars! I'm flying to -- 
Randolph, whose face is now bright red, can't take it anymore. He runs onto the stage. He grabs the rocket cookie from Smoochy. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
RANDOLPH Are you fucking blind?! It's a cock! Not a space ship! Cock! Cock! 
INT. STAIRWELL - MOMENTS LATER 
Three burly Kidnet security guards drag Randolph down the stairwell. They beat the shit out of him and toss him through the exit door. 
INT. FRANK STOKES' OFFICE - TIGHT ON NEW YORK POST FRONT PAGE - DAY 
The headline reads: "Rainbow Randolph Interrupts Smoochy Taping." The subhead reads: "Runs Onstage Shouting Penis Related Obscenities." 
WIDE 
Burke sits on the couch next to Sheldon, reading the paper. He shakes his head in disgust. Nora sits in a chair near Stokes. 
CONTINUED: 
BURKE Think of it as a tool of the trade. 
SHELDON I've never owned a gun, I've never touched a gun, and I don't believe in guns. When I played cowboys and Indians as a kid, I was always the Chinese railroad worker. 
BURKE Trust me, Shel. It's a handy accessory in this business. Even if you don't load it, have it for show. Sometimes that's all you need. Especially with a creep like Randolph lurking around. 
Burke and Sheldon look up and notice the hulking, grinning figure of SPINNER DUNN standing over them. Spinner has the smile of a little boy despite his crooked nose and scarred face. He extends his hand. 
SPINNER Hiya, Smoochy! I'm Spinner! Spinner! 
SHELDON Hi there. 
SPINNER I'm so excited to meet you!    I'm Spinner! 
Spinner's massive hand engulfs Sheldon's. 
SHELDON (remembers) Oh... right. I saw you fight on TV once. I think it was your farewell bout. 
SWISH PAN TO: 
FLASHBACK - INT. BOXING RING(S) - SOMETIME IN THE PAST 
Through a SERIES OF CUTS we see Spinner getting pummeled in various fights. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
RINGSIDE COMMENTATOR #1 Tonight marks Spinner Dunn's final appearance in the ring. What a pleasure it's been to watch him proudly march into the record books for taking more blows to the head than any fighter in history. 
A bloodied, defeated Spinner happily holds up the arm of his opponent after a match. He then hugs the referee. He jumps down from the ring and hugs the three judges. 
RINGSIDE COMMENTATOR #2 Scrambled a bit? Sure. You don't retire with a record of 81-59 and wind up the Governor. But on the upside, he's got the disposition of a collie. 
Spinner wades into the stands and starts hugging the spectators. 
SWISH PAN TO: 
INT. SPINNER DUNN'S RESTAURANT (PRESENT) 
Spinner is still pumping Sheldon's hand. 
SPINNER You know what I love, Smoochy? I love when you do the Jiggy Ziggy dance! You know, the one you do during 'Silly Time?' 
SHELDON You bet.     That's a big one. 
SPINNER Wanna see me do it? 
SHELDON Well, I don't know why if there's enough room here to... 
Spinner starts Jiggying and Ziggying for Sheldon. He bangs into a table and knocks over someone's drink. 
BURKE Okay, champ, don't get overheated. 
Spinner stops, out of breath.       He leans over and hugs Sheldon. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
SPINNER I love you. 
SHELDON I... uh... love you, too, Spinner. 
A powerful-looking woman, TOMMY COTTER, calls to Spinner from the bar. 
TOMMY Spinner, come over and meet the Senator! 
Spinner dutifully hurries over to Tommy. 
SHELDON He seems pretty popular. It must take real talent to run a place like this. 
BURKE Spinner? The guy couldn't run a water faucet. He's just a mascot. It's his cousins, a bunch of Irish mob boys, who really run the joint. 
ANGLE ON SPINNER 
He shakes the Senator's hand as Tommy and a few other tough Irish guys stand around. Spinner looks over towards Sheldon. 
SPINNER (loudly) Don't go anywhere, Smoochy! I'll be right back after I take a dump! 
Spinner releases the Senator's hand and rushes off. 
BURKE I think you made a new friend, kid. 
Nora is on the phone. She pretends not to notice him. Sheldon bides his time by inspecting knickknacks, examining photos on the wall, etc. Finally, he half- whispers/half-mouths to her: 
SHELDON Whenever you get a chance... I just need a second. 
NORA (into the phone) Listen, can I call you back? Yeah, some asshole's screaming in my ear. Thanks. 
She hangs up. 
SHELDON I'm sorry, you didn't have to hang up. 
NORA If I didn't you'd still be here. 
SHELDON But I am still here. 
NORA I'm hoping to correct that. 
SHELDON Nora, I want us to start off on the right foot. I want you to know that I value your input and I don't want you to feel intimidated just because the power structure has changed a bit. I consider you a partner. 
NORA Great. That'll come in handy if we're ever at a square dance. 
SHELDON Well, I was never much of the do- se-do type, but what I would love to do is take you out to lunch one day. You know, just two colleagues chewing the fat... forming a mutual respect... planting the seeds of cooperation... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
NORA No. 
SHELDON Fair enough. If you change your mind -- 
NORA I won't. 
Sheldon just nods and starts to exit. 
SHELDON Okay then, I'll be in my office if you need me. If you want to brainstorm about anything. Ideas and so forth. 
He passes a plant by the door. 
SHELDON Ficus? 
She ignores him.      He exits. 
INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION 
Sheldon walks slowly down the hallway.     He no longer has a bounce in his step. 
INT. SHELDON'S NEW OFFICE - MOMENT LATER 
Sheldon enters his plush new office, awkwardly walks over to his new desk and sits behind it for the first time. 
SHELDON Wow... 
TOMMY (O.S.) My cousin Spinner's take quite a shine to you. 
Sheldon jumps. He's surprised to Tommy from Spinner Dunn's restaurant. Tommy's crew, ROY, DANNY, JIMMY and SAMMY occupy the sofa. 
TOMMY Ever since you came in the restaurant. He can't stop yakkin'. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
SHELDON Well, he's a very nice man. Very sweet disposition for someone that size. 
TOMMY So, I was wondering if maybe you could give him a little floor space. 
SHELDON I'm sorry? 
TOMMY You know, a little part on the show. You're the executive producer now. You call the shots, right? 
SHELDON Uh, that's a very sweet offer, and I love Spinner, but TV is a complicated medium and... I mean, that would be like me getting into the ring with a prizefighter. (laughs) Can you imagine such a thing? Boom. K.O.! What's the alphabet, Mommy? 
Sheldon laughs again.       Tommy gets quiet. 
TOMMY This makes me sad.    Very, very, sad. 
DANNY What's wrong, Tommy? 
TOMMY Nothing.     I'm just very sad right now. 
SAMMY Who made you sad, Tommy? 
TOMMY I don't want to mention names. 
The guys look menacingly at Sheldon. They rise and walk around his desk until they're on either side of him. 
She exits.    A confused Sheldon looks at the "Around Town" column. 
INSERT - HEADLINE 
"GARDEN TO HOST SMOOCHY ON ICE."      The subhead reads: 
"HUGE GATE EXPECTED -- VENDORS SALIVATE AT SMELL OF BIG BUCKS." 
CUT TO: 
INT. SPINNER DUNN'S - EVENING 
We are TIGHT ON the feet of an Irish dancer doing a sort of Riverdance. We WIDEN OUT and the rest of the dancers come INTO FRAME. Spinner and the mob ar clapping and whooping. 
Sheldon and Burke sit at a table in the dark club having a conversation. 
SHELDON Burke, I never agreed to do an ice show. 
BURKE Shel, do you know what kind of cash we'll take in between the gate and concessions? A venture like this gets you money and muscle. Times twenty. 
SHELDON Ice shows represent everything I'm against. They're mindless spectacles whose main purpose is to sell overpriced sugar-water and cheap plastic toys that splinter in a kid's mouth on the ride home. 
BURKE Look, I know you got this fetish for ethics, but now's not the time to fly that kite. No one's ever refused a shot at an ice show. 
Sheldon tears the contract in half. 
SHELDON Until now. Smoochy doesn't sell out, Burke. You should be proud of that. Proud that you represent a client who paves driveways, not paints them over. 
BURKE I'm thrilled, Shel. Knocked out. 
Burke just sits there, stunned.   A waitress, SANDY, passes by the booth. 
SHELDON I'll have a pineapple juice, Sandy. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
SANDY Pineapple? What happened to orange juice? 
SHELDON I'm feeling feisty tonight. 
INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - DAY 
We are now on a drum solo. Ernie the Elephant of the Smoochyland Band works it. The animal band plays a sloppy version of "Pop Goes the Weasel." End on Spinner Dunn -- the newest and by far largest member of the band. Spinner holds s cowbell and seems to be concentrating intently on the proper moment to hit it. Unfortunately, his rhythm is off, which throws the rest of the band off as well. 
We WIDEN OUT to see Smoochy and the Rhinettes attempting to dance to the off-kilter rhythm. The song finally ends. The Rhinettes glare at Spinner. Smoochy addresses the camera. 
SMOOCHY Boy, wasn't that fun? In an awkward kind of way? Anyhoo, how 'bout a big round of applause for the newest member of the Smoochyland Band... former heavyweight contender, Spinner Dunn! 
Spinner stands up to take a bow and almost knocks the entire bandstand over. There is a smattering of confused applause from the kids in the bleachers. Spinner drops the cowbell and it clangs on the studio floor. 
SPINNER Shit.   Sorry. 
INT. BACKSTAGE - AFTER SHOW 
A beaming Spinner runs up to Sheldon, who's still in costume. 
SPINNER Did I do good, Sheldon, huh?   Did I do good? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
SHELDON Yeah, that was great, Spinner. Just watch your elbow next time. Pinky's probably gonna lose that tooth. 
SPINNER Okey doke.   I'm gonna go get drunk now. 
Spinner skips off humming "Pop Goes the Weasel" and banging his cowbell. Nora passes Sheldon backstage. 
NORA Nice job. Casting the show with mental patients, I like that. 
SHELDON (snapping) He is not a mental patient. He's an ex-boxer and nightclub owner who happens to have the sweet innocent brian of a five-year-old! 
NORA Excuse me for not making the distinction. 
She leaves. 
EXT. BROADWAY (TIMES SQUARE) - NIGHT 
Sheldon exits the Kidnet building and walks to the curb to hail a cab. A friendly-looking man in a suit and bow tie approaches him. This is MERV GREEN. 
MERV Hi there. 
SHELDON Hi. 
SHELDON Wow.   I'm honored. 
Nora trips slightly.     Sheldon takes the whiskey from her. 
SHELDON Why don't we get some air? 
He leads her out on the balcony.    They look out at the city. 
NORA I... I may have been a little harsh when we spoke the other day. A little out of line. 
SHELDON Well, it wasn't as bad as the week before when you called me a pasty- faced, no-talent hack. 
NORA Yes, that was probably insensitive as well. (looks at him) I heard you're not doing the ice show. I find that... incredibly admirable. Why didn't you tell me? 
SHELDON I guess I didn't want to spoil your fun. You look so content when you're berating me. 
Nora looks down. 
NORA I'm afraid I have become a bit hardened over the years. Sincerity's an easy disguise in this business. It's hard to know who's on the level. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
SHELDON Believe me, I'm learning that more and more every day. (wistfully) 'Sometimes light is really dark, Sometimes crows can sing like larks Sometimes Winter feels like Spring, Don't think you know everything.' 
NORA (in disbelief) 'Rickets the Hippo'? 
SHELDON You remember Rickets? 
NORA That was my favorite show when I was a kid. Rickets was the one face I knew I could trust. 
SHELDON That's how I felt! Rickets had real depth. He was my inspiration for Smoochy. 
NORA Really? He was my inspiration to work in children's television. 
SHELDON I can't believe it. I never met anyone who even remembers Rickets. Do you remember the Klunky-Wunky dance? 
NORA Remember it?   I did it at my first communion. 
Sheldon starts doing the rather insane-looking Klunky- Wunky dance. Nora does it with him. They both stop and look at each other. Sheldon impulsively leans in and kisses her. 
SHELDON I'm sorry. That was a mistake, right? I didn't mean for that to hap-- 
Nora grabs his head and pulls it toward her.       They begin kissing passionately. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
NORA (as they kiss) You're not full of shit like all the others, are you? 
SHELDON No, no. 
NORA (as they kiss) You're for real, right? 
SHELDON Yes, yes. 
NORA (through the kisses) I mean, I couldn't tell... First I thought it was an act... and then I just thought you were a simp or something... 
SHELDON Shhh... you don't have to explain... 
They continue to kiss.      Nora abruptly stops. 
NORA I should go. 
SHELDON Why? 
Nora exits the balcony and collects her coat and purse. 
SHELDON What's wrong? Is it the whiskey? If you have to throw up, be my guest. Anywhere you like. 
NORA It's just getting late. 
Sheldon follows her to the door. She stops and looks at him for a moment. The PHONE starts to RING. Neither of them says anything for a beat. 
NORA Better get that.    Good night. 
She exits. Sheldon shuts the door and sighs. He goes to the bar to pour himself another orange juice before picking up the phone. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
SHELDON Hello? 
A huge swastika banner unfurls behind Smoochy, framing him like Patton in front of the American flag. Flashbulbs go off. The "Heil Smoochys" continue. A GERMAN MARCH starts to BLARE from the SPEAKERS. Looking stunned, Sheldon slowly leans into the mic. He clears his throat. The MUSIC STOPS. Everyone quiets down. He searches for just the right words, and finally... 
SHELDON It's my sincere hope that I'm dreaming right now, but in the event that I'm not... what's the deal with the swastikas? 
Suddenly, a sea of policemen bursts into the warehouse. 
LEAD COP This is an unlawful assembly, you kraut sons-a-bitches! You're all under arrest! 
Pandemonium ensues us all the Nazis run for cover. Sheldon stands in the middle of it all, unsure what to do. 
EXT. WAREHOUSE - SHORT WHILE LATER 
Sheldon is led from the warehouse in handcuffs and is barraged with questions from waiting REPORTERS. Flashbulbs go off as they shout out questions. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
REPORTER #1 Are you officially a member of the Aryan Brotherhood, Sheldon? 
REPORTER #2 Is it true you consider Adolph Hitler your personal hero? 
REPORTER #3 Do you think associating with neo- Nazis might adversely affect your career? 
REPORTER #4 How does it feel to be a hate- filled racist scumbag? 
SHELDON This is a mix-up! I'm innocent! I don't hate anyone! 
REPORTER #4 Does that mean you don't hate Nazis? 
SHELDON Wait!   I didn't say that!   I -- 
Sheldon is shoved into the back seat of a squad car.     It drives off, SIRENS BLARING. 
MONTAGE 
EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT 
The squad car drives through Times Square. The headlines on the zipper marquee GLIDE THROUGH the FRAME: "Smoochy the Rhino Arrested at Nazi Rally... Cops Raid Warehouse During Rhino's Performance... Aryan Brotherhood Declares Smoochy 'One of us.'... President Condemns 'Smoochy the Fascist'..."

On a large screen TV the smiling Asian face of Takashi Yamashita, who's singing Cole Porter's "I Get a Kick Out of You" in Japanese. 
CUT BACK to reveal Takashi wearing a white sequined tuxedo with tails as he plays a white grand piano. He looks like an Asian Liberace. He is circled by a group of Japanese children who sing along with him. 
CHICK (V.O.) 'Takashi Sings Tin Pan Alley for Youngsters' is the hottest show on Japanese television. The sweat shops are working overtime trying to keep up with the demand. Record albums, toys, cereal, tee shirts, you name it... 
INT. STOKES' OFFICE - DAY 
Several tough-looking Asian men -- CHICK, SAMBO, and TOBI -- Takashi's management group -- sits in Stokes' office. Takashi sits quietly in the corner. Stokes sits behind his desk, sipping his trademark glass of wine. 
CHICK Look, Stokes, let's cut the bullshit. We want Takashi in that Smoochy slot and we're willing to do whatever it takes to get it. 
STOKES Pardon me for saying this, but for a non-resident of this country, you speak impeccable English. 
CHICK I'm originally from Teaneck. 
STOKES Ah. 
CHICK We own every hair on this bastard's head and we're willing to share a few strands... if you get my drift. 
STOKES Well, it's not that simple. I have an executive board to answer to. I wish I could just snap my fingers and make a deal but -- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
CHICK You mean like this? 
Chick snaps his fingers and Tobi, the third Asian guy, walks over and drops a duffel bag on Stokes' desk. 
STOKES Oh my.   And what is this on my desk? 
CHICK Two hundred grand in a Louis Vuitton duffle bag. Get our boy the slot and we'll round it off to a million. And you can keep the luggage. 
Stokes stares down at the bundle of opportunity on his desk. 
CHICK You're dealing with an honorable culture, Frank. We know how to play ball. 
Stokes unzips the bag and gazes at the money.     He looks up at Chick and smiles. 
STOKES Gentlemen, I suddenly feel invigorated and full of hope. 
Chick smiles. 
INT. NORA'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING 
On Nora's TV screen, we see the black and white image of Rickets the Hippo doing the "Klunky-Wunky Dance." Nora sits on the couch and stares hypnotically at the screen. There is a KNOCK at the door. She gets up and ejects the "Best of Rickets" tape. She opens the door. To her surprise, Randolph is standing there. 
RANDOLPH Hiya, cutie! 
Before she can respond, he enters the apartment and takes off his jacket. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
RANDOLPH So here's the good news: Yes, I'll be happy to end my sabbatical and return to my old slot. I know you and Frank are in a bind, so I'll start Monday. Call wardrobe, call props, tell 'em the R man is back and he's ready to start whistlin' dem happy tunes for da little chillens. 
He flops down on the couch. 
RANDOLPH Ahhh. Who do ya gotta blow to get a Scotch around here? 
He laughs. 
NORA You've got three seconds to pry your ass off my couch and get out. 
Randolph jumps to his feet. 
RANDOLPH Dammit, Nora! The rhino's gone! You need that slot filled and I'm ready to reclaim what's rightfully mine. 
NORA Just in case you forgot, you're a criminal and a scumbag. 
RANDOLPH Okay, so maybe I commandeered a stray shekel or two. Big deal! Compared to what Smoochy did that's like jerking off in the supermarket. 
NORA Where do you shop? 
Randolph walks over and puts his hands on her shoulders. 
RANDOLPH Come on. Have you lost all affection for me? After what we once had? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
NORA That was a long time ago.    I was young and stupid. 
RANDOLPH'S POV - DANNY 
approaches. He cocks his arm and throws a punch. Danny's fist FILLS the FRAME, TURNING IT BLACK as we hear the PUNCH. 
EXT. TIMES SQUARE - SERIES OF DISSOLVES - BEFORE DAWN 
Newspaper trucks pull up to various newsstands and toss out bundles of the morning editions. As each bundle lands on the curb, we see headlines that span over the next few days: 
SMOOCHY SET UP - SMILEY BEHIND NAZI PLOT 
PLANNED TO DESTROY RHINO'S REP 
POLL:   RAINBOW RANDOLPH MOST HATED MAN IN AMERICA 
PUBLIC OUTCRY:   "WE'RE SORRY SMOOCHY!" 
EXT. POLICE PRECINCT - DAY 
Randolph, bruised and battered, emerges from the police station with his LAWYER. REPORTERS and photographers rush forward. 
REPORTER #1 How does it feel to be voted the most hated man in America, Randolph? 
RANDOLPH In a country like this, where your average citizen is a fuckin' Neanderthal, I wear it as a badge of honor. 
REPORTER #2 What about Ms. Bishop's charge that you have an unhealthy obsession with Sheldon Mopes? 
RANDOLPH Listen, I barely know that broad. She's a wacko. An opportunist. I'm the most accused man since Jimmy Hoffa. 
Someone throws an egg and it hits Randolph in the face. 
RANDOLPH (on verge of tears) That was unfair! Who threw that? That was mean and uncalled for! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
LAWYER My client is not answering any more questions. Between his dwindling cash flow and mounting legal bills he's sinking into a deep psychotic depression. Please stop antagonizing him. Thank you. 
He pushes a sullen Randolph through the cluster of people. 
INT. BACKSTAGE - STUDIO C - DAY 
A makeup woman dabs Sheldon's forehead as he's about to go on. Nora stands next to him. A LOW TYMPANY ROLL is heard from the stage. 
SHELDON (to Nora) I wouldn't be back here if it wasn't for you. 
NORA I'm just sorry I didn't believe you... that I got swept up in the frenzy of anti-Smoochyism. 
SHELDON Well, this town's a house of mirrors sometimes. It's hard to know what you're looking at. 
He takes a couple of pre-show deep breaths.      A STAGEHAND approaches. 
STAGEHAND They're ready for you, Sheldon. 
Sheldon exits backstage. 
INT. STUDIO C - CONTINUOUS ACTION 
The lights in the studio dim. 
ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Ladies and gentlemen... boys and girls... (dramatic pause) Who's your favorite rhino? 
An explosion of enthusiasm from the kids in the bleachers. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
KIDS IN BLEACHERS Smoochy!!! 
The lights come up as the Smoochyland Band plays a strong, dramatic version of "Battle Hymn of the Republic." After a moment, Smoochy slowly rises from a lift under the stage. A giant sign above the jungle lights up and emits a pyrotechnic shower of sparks. It reads: WELCOME HOME SMOOCHY! 
ANGLE ON SMOOCHYLAND BAND 
A beaming Spinner Dunn enthusiastically bangs his cowbell to the music as tears stream down his cheeks. 
BACK ON SMOOCHY 
He majestically stands center stage and nods to the kids who are giving him a standing ovation. The song crescendos with a rousing final chorus from the Smoochyland Band who sing, "His truth is marching on!" 
Thunderous applause from the bleachers. Smoochy walks over to a stool and takes a seat. It's very quiet in the studio now. Smoochy, looking uncharacteristically serious, picks up a microphone as the lights go down. He's in black limbo. 
SMOOCHY Thank you. It's good to be back. You know, kids, sometimes life in the jungle can be unfair. A place where nice guys don't just finish last... they get their heads cut off. 
Gasps from the bleachers. 
WIDER 
Randolph stands on the table directly in front of the Kidnet Building. He raises the megaphone to his mouth. 
RANDOLPH Attention, New Yorkers! You are about to hear a shocking story of injustice! 
WIDER 
Randolph stands on the table directly in front of the Kidnet Building. 
RANDOLPH I urge you to listen! It has a surprise ending you won't want to miss! 
A crowd starts to form on the sidewalk. 
RANDOLPH It's the story of a venomous rhino and his aggressive campaign to slander, vilify, defame, denigrate and villainize my good name! But one thing he can't do, is take my life from me. No, friends, only I have the power to do that! 
He reaches down and picks up a can of gasoline. 
RANDOLPH This is what Smoochy has done to me! He's brought me to this! I can no longer live in a world where the innocent suffer and the wicked thrive! 
Randolph raises the can over his head and pauses dramatically. 
RANDOLPH Where is God??!! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
He drenches himself with gasoline. The crowd grows larger. He holds up a pack of matches. 
RANDOLPH I'm sorry to do this, people. Don't try to talk me out of it. 
The crowd starts to applaud.     Randolph looks baffled. 
MAN IN CROWD Do it!   Light it! 
RANDOLPH Our guest of honor will be here any moment! This is for his eyes! For his conscience. He'll have to live with this imagine for the rest of his miserable life! 
INT. LIMO - CONTINUOUS ACTION 
Sheldon sits in the back of a limo on his way to work, reading the paper. The headline blares: "SMOOCHY ANNOUNCES ICE SHOW AT GARDEN." The subhead reads: "ALL PROCEEDS TO BENEFIT BROOKLYN CLINIC." 
SMOOCHY (to driver) Take it from me, Lester. Use your power. Don't squander it -- build with it. 
LESTER Sound advice, Mr. Mopes. If I ever get any power I'll give that a whirl. (notices crowd up ahead) Hey, what's going on up there? 
Sheldon glances up from his paper. 
SMOOCHY (casually) Looks like a street performer of some sort. 
He goes back to his paper. 
EXT. TIMES SQUARE - CONTINUOUS ACTION 
Randolph sees the Kidnet limo approaching. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
RANDOLPH This is it, folks! It's showtime! I'm sorry to do this, but he's left me no choice! 
Randolph tries to light another match, but it's wet from the gasoline. The crowd laughs and starts taunting him. 
RANDOLPH Shut up, you hillbilly assholes! You're borough trash! Go back to your huts across the river! 
Randolph keeps trying to light the match. Finally, after several attempts, it lights. He holds it up. The crowd burst into applause. 
RANDOLPH Fuck you! Fuck all you people! I was the last of the Mohicans! You'll never see another Rainbow Randolph in this lifetime! You had me and you blew it! All of you! 
He turns and faces the approaching limousine. 
RANDOLPH This if for you, Smoochy! Remember this! As long as you live, remember this image! You did this to me! 
He brings the match closer to his gasoline-soaked body. The limo continues to approach. The crowd taunts him to do it. He tries to bring the match closer, but his hand is shaking. Suddenly, a LITTLE GIRL pushes through the crowd. Everyone quiets down as she looks up at Randolph. 
LITTLE GIRL Whatcha doin', Rainbow Randolph? 
Randolph freezes as he looks down at the Little Girl. A slight look of hope comes over his face. She smiles sweetly at him, walks over, and blows out the match. Randolph is overcome with emotion. Just then, Sheldon's LIMO WHOOSHES past him. The crowd cheers. 
CROWD Smoochy!!! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
SHELDON Hi. 
NORA I read about the ice show. 
SHELDON Yeah, the papers seem to be really covering it. 
NORA I think it's great. What you're doing for that clinic. 
SHELDON Thanks. 
She nods. 
NORA I just need some clarification... 
SHELDON Don't worry. Spinner just needs a little more rehearsal. I'll get him there. 
NORA No I mean about us. 
Sheldon looks uncomfortable. 
NORA Ever since you've been back I just feel like there's something that's not connecting. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
SHELDON I guess I'm still readjusting a little. Like a guy who's come back from the war. Not that I'd equate my misfortune with the 
brave men and women who protect us overseas. 
NORA I just thought we were on our way to something... granted, my mistaken belief that you had ties to Neo-Nazis might have put a damper on our relationship, but I'm sorry for -- 
Sheldon suddenly jumps up and grabs her. He kisses her passionately. Nora immediately starts ripping off his costume as they make out. They fall to the floor in a lustful embrace. 
INT. STUDIO - BACK HALLWAY - SAME TIME 
Spinner, humming to himself, lumbers down the hallway on his way to the wardrobe room. Halfway down the hall, he hears a voice call out to him. 
VOICE (O.S.) Hey -- rhino. 
Spinner turns around. The door to the fire exit swings open. Two of Merv's thugs emerge and grab Spinner (who's still in full Moochy costume) and drag him into the stairwell. 
INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE - MOMENT LATER 
Spinner is dragged into the garage and knocked to the pavement. Several more thugs emerge from the shadows, including Henry, Merv's main henchman. They start beating him with lead pipes. Henry pulls out a REVOLVER. He SHOOTS the rhino several times. A sedan trunk is popped open and Moochy is thrown inside. The CAR SCREECHES up to the street. 
INT. CHINATOWN - NIGHT 
We CRANE DOWN FROM a Chinese banner that stretches across two tenements. We LAND ON the seedy, deserted street below as the SEDAN BARRELS INTO FRAME and SQUEALS to a stop. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Two thugs emerge from the car. They pull Spinner/Moochy from the trunk and toss his body by some garbage cans, knocking a few over. They get back in the car and speed away. Moochy's lifeless foam body rolls into the gutter and lays motionless. Blood seeps through his foamy torso. 
LOW OVERHEAD SHOT 
of Spinner/Moochy. We SLOWLY START TO RISE UP as we LOOK DOWN AT the rhino's body. The WIND WHISTLES through the empty street as we get HIGHER. The Chinese banner rustles THROUGH the FRAME. As we get HIGHER AND HIGHER, we hear the intermittent CLANG of a PRIZE FIGHT BELL. 
MATCH DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. SAME STREET - HOURS LATER 
In the same frame, detectives and uniformed cops are now at the scene gathering evidence. Where Spinner once lay, there is now a bright yellow chalk outline in the shape of a rhinoceros. 
INT. PARADE OF HOPE OFFICES - NEXT DAY 
FULL FRAME ON a TELEVISION screen.    A local news anchor is reading the top story. 
ANCHOR (V.O.) Former heavyweight contender and restaurateur Lawrence 'Spinner' Dunn was found shot to death in a rhinoceros outfit early this morning in Chinatown. Dunn, a frequent performer on 'Smoochy's Magic Jungle,' was pronounced dead at the scene. Police are searching for -- 
A hand ENTERS FRAME and violently slaps the TV OFF.

An enraged Merv Green glares at his henchmen, Henry and MITCH. 
MERV How could you hit the wrong rhino?! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
HENRY Who knew Smoochy had a cousin Moochy? They look fucking identical. 
MERV Smoochy is bright orange, Moochy is burnt rust! Read the papers! Do I gotta take you back to fucking kindergarten? 
INT. LIBERTY BISCUIT AND FLOUR FACTORY - CONTINUOUS ACTION 
Inside the massive dormant factory, rats scurry around and pigeons occasionally fly from window sill to window sill. A makeshift living area has been set up in the middle of it all -- a chair, lamp, small table, hot plate, etc. Randolph lays on the dilapidated conveyor belt, huddled under a blanket. 
Angelo enters the factory through a rusty door, carrying provisions. 
ANGELO It's heatin' up out there. Every cop in New York is looking for you. And Tommy Cotter's boys are combin' the streets. You're gonna have to stay put for a while. 
Randolph sits up on the conveyor belt, blanket draped over his shoulders. He's a physical and emotional wreck. 
RANDOLPH I was an altar boy once. Did you know that? I wanted to be a priest. Do you believe in angels, Angie? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
ANGELO Angels? 
RANDOLPH There was a little angel in pigtails. She was the only one who cared about me. She saved my life. 
Angelo hops up on the conveyor belt to console Randolph. Randolph rests his head on Angelo's shoulder. 
ANGELO You didn't want to kill yourself, Randy. You know that. 
RANDOLPH Perhaps it's time to heal. To accept the fact that Smoochy has won and gracefully march forward. True, I'm currently wanted for a murder I didn't commit. But I have faith. Faith that justice will prevail. 
ANGELO Now you're talkin', kid. This is a big step... I'm proud of you. 
He strokes Randolph's head. 
RANDOLPH Did you bring lunch? 
ANGELO Yes. 
RANDOLPH Chicken and stars? 
ANGELO Just like you asked for. 
RANDOLPH Can I have some, please? 
ANGELO For a smile. 
Randolph sniffs and manages a small pitiful smile. Angelo musses his hair. 
ANGELO Atta boy. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Angelo lifts one of the grocery bags onto the conveyor belt. 
ANGELO Here, I got you some crossword puzzles and stuff to read. 
Angelo hops off the conveyor belt and turns on the hot plate. He starts to open a can of soup. Randolph reaches into the bag and pulls out a copy of the New York Post. The lead article's headline reads, "WAKE FOR SPINNER." A large photograph shows mourners leaving the restaurant after the wake. Clearly visible are Sheldon and Nora. They have their arms around each other. Randolph's eyes widen. He starts to hyperventilate. Angelo looks up. 
ANGELO You okay? Randy? 
Finally, Randolph expels a blood-curdling scream that ECHOES through the factory. 
RANDOLPH Motherfucker!!!!!!! 
Angelo drops the soup.      Birds in the factory flutter from the rafters. 
INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - ICE RINK 
Sheldon and the Rhinettes work on some choreography for that night's show. Nora watches from the sidelines. As Sheldon skates on the ice rink, Merv enters with Roy and Danny. Sheldon skates over to them. Nora walks over, too. 
TOMMY Big news, Shel. 
SHELDON What's that? 
TOMMY It wasn't Smiley who killed Spinner. It was Parade of Hope. 
NORA Merv Green? 
SHELDON Are you sure? The cops have tons of evidence on Randolph. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
TOMMY We did our own investigation. Cousin Ian from down at the morgue... you met him at the wake... 
FLASHBACK - INT. SPINNER DUNN'S - DAY 
He removes the knife from her throat and hurls it toward the bulletin board. It lands -- sticking right in the middle of a Smoochy card. 
CHICK Auf Wiedersehen, honey. 
They exit. 
INT. SHELDON'S PENTHOUSE - NIGHT 
Nora is pacing.    Sheldon sits by the fire. 
NORA It's Stokes. He's behind the whole thing! He cut some kind of deal for the Smoochy slot! 
SHELDON What are you talking about? 
NORA He wants you out so he can put Takashi in! 
SHELDON Who's Takashi? 
NORA Jesus, Sheldon! Don't you ever pick up a copy of International Performer? He's the hottest kid show host from Asia. 
Sheldon's head is swimming. Suddenly the front door to to the penthouse bursts open. Randolph, dressed like he's about to do his old show, stumbles in waving a gun. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
RANDOLPH Ah! How very cozy. Like two logs in a little bonfire. All we need is a few sticks and some wienies. 
He almost trips as he stumbles over to Sheldon.      He waves the gun in his face. 
RANDOLPH I had her before you! Pachyderm! I was in love with her! In love! And you snatched her away! Like a common thief! You're the bad guy! Not me! He's the bad guy, Nora. He's incapable of understanding the love we once had! Tender, yet passionate. Old-fashioned, yet experimental. (cackles) Tell him about a few of our experiments, Nora! Tell him! 
Sheldon looks stunned.    Nora hangs her head. 
SHELDON (to Nora) Is this true? Please tell me it's just the confused ramblings of a diseased mind. 
She looks at him, but doesn't say anything. 
SHELDON Holy mother of Toledo. When exactly were you planning to let me know about this?! 
NORA (turns to Sheldon) Listen, there was a time -- and I'm not proud of this -- but there was a time when I was a bit of a... kiddie-host groupie. 
RANDOLPH You're just another action figure for her collection! 
NORA That's not fair! 
RANDOLPH Tell him about Jingle Jackson! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
SHELDON You dated Jingle Jackson? 
RANDOLPH The bells turned her on. Hey, tell him about Jumbo Johnny! There's a tale for ya! A whale of a tale! 
She looks down, somewhat ashamed.      A look of utter shock 
comes over Sheldon. 
SHELDON Oh good Lord in Heaven. 
NORA Look, what I did before I met you is none of your business. 
RANDOLPH Shut up!   Both of you! This is my show! 
He waves the gun threateningly as he backs up to an armchair and sits down. 
RANDOLPH Do you fully understand the power of a condemned man? Do you? I'm already wanted for one murder, why should I give a flaming horse's twat if I commit two more? 
SHELDON I... uh... read once that the best way to diffuse a tense situation is with a little humor. To that end, would you like to hear a funny joke? 
RANDOLPH (rolling his eyes) Oh, please. Go blow yourself, Martha. (waves gun again) Fix me a beverage, woman. Make me one of those drinks that used to make us all warm and fuzzy before bouncy-bouncy time! 
NORA Fix it yourself, asshole. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
RANDOLPH (points to gun) Remember, I have Mr. Boomy. 
SHELDON I'm telling you, you'd love this joke. It revolves around Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny getting into a fender bender. 
Nora rolls her eyes and goes to the bar. 
RANDOLPH (mouthing to Nora) I tried. 
Sheldon stuffs some extra bullets in his pocket. 
SHELDON (to Randolph) Okay, buddy, we have to get down to the Garden. You're welcome to stay here as long as you like. Just don't leave until I get things squared away. 
Randolph gets up and walks over to him. 
RANDOLPH Be careful, Sheldon. Remember what I told you -- you've only scratched the surface of this scummy business. You have yet to strike oil. 
Randolph looks at him for a moment before turning to Nora. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
RANDOLPH You're lucky to have a guy like Smoochy. 
NORA You just rest, Randolph. 
RANDOLPH He's the real thing. Smoochy's the real thing. And I've been a fraud. A wicked man doing wicked acts. 
Sheldon slaps the cylinder into place and tucks the gun in his waistband. 
SHELDON Well, we all have our bad days. 
He exits. 
INT. HAWAII KAI - LATER THAT EVENING 
A hula dancer performs on a tiny stage in the nightclub. A small Hawaiian string band plays behind her. Burke and a nervous-looking Stokes sit in a booth. 
STOKES Things are getting out of hand. We have to cover our tracks. 
BURKE Relax, everything's gonna work out. 
STOKES Relax? They found Merv Green's head on the Grand Concourse! Excuse my concern. 
BURKE Look, we can cover all the tracks we want, but in the end we still got the same problem. We gotta finish what we started. 
STOKES God help us... 
Stokes shakily takes a sip of his drink. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BURKE It'll all be over tonight. Buggy's gonna take care of everything. 
STOKES Buggy? Buggy Ding-Dong? The guy who hosted 'Buggy's Bumpy Railroad'? 
STOKES Yeah, until he discovered the joys of Turkish black mule heroin. For the right price he'll do anything. It's amazing the guy's still alive. 
Stokes buries his head in his hands. 
STOKES I don't know, Burke... this whole thing... 
A shadow falls across their table.    Burke looks up. 
BURKE Speak of the devil. Have a seat, Bug. 
Buggy Ding-Dong's hand ENTERS the FRAME and snubs out his Camel. Stokes looks up. 
STOKES (attempting to sound cheerful) Buggy. You're looking good. 
ANGLE ON BUGGY 
A man who looks like he would first kill you then eat you for dinner, slides into the booth next to Stokes. 
BURKE It's time we put this thing to rest, Frank. And the way I see it... the rhino's up past his bedtime. 
Burke hands a folded envelope to Buggy who puts it into his jacket pocket. He lights another Camel. 
EXT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - AERIAL SHOT - EVENING 
"SMOOCH ON ICE -- SOLD OUT!" flashes on the electronic marquee. 
EXT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS ACTION 
Men, women and children flood in through the turnstiles. 
INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - CONTINUOUS ACTION 
Ushers, costumed as Rhinettes, help people to their seats. People mull about the concession stands which are adorned with signs that read: "Complimentary Apple Slices!" "Have a Salt-Free Pretzel!" "Enjoy a Soy Dog on Smoochy!" "Fresh Squeezed O.J. -- Have a Glass!" "Sugar Free Brownies -- They're Not as Bad as they Sound!" "Free! Everything is Free!" "Keep Your Wallet in Your Pocket!" "Friendship is More Important than Money!" 
Randolph emerges from a cab and runs through the crowd outside the Garden. A few people recognize him. 
MAN It's Rainbow Randolph!   Someone stop him! 
Randolph finds a side exit and slips into the arena. 
INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - FEW MINUTES LATER 
The "Opera on Ice" continues. The soprano continues singing as Smoochy reenacts the incidents of his recent life. The fairy princess brings Smoochy to a room with a gleaming white desk. Smoochy takes a seat behind the desk. The fairy princess places a crown on his head, bids him good-bye, and floats away. Smoochy sits proudly in his new world. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Suddenly, Rhinettes dressed as devils glide in and skate in a circle around the desk. They throw money at Smoochy. He jumps up and skates away, but the Rhinette devils pursue him with daggers. The music from the orchestra intensifies as the drama plays out. 
NETWORK BOX 
Nora continues to watch the opera, totally entranced. Stokes and Burke look a little on edge. Burke glances at his watch. 
CATWALK 
Buggy finishes loading the rifle. He shines the barrel with his sleeve and looks through the scope as Smoochy and company continue to perform below. 
POV THROUGH RIFLE SCOPE 
Atmospheric fog created by the smoke machine is so thick that Buggy has difficulty FINDING Sheldon THROUGH the cross-hairs. Occasionally, Smoochy skates through a hole in the clouds only to disappear again. BUGGY CURSES in frustration. 
ARENA 
Randolph pushes his way past Garden security and runs toward the rink. Several cops working the event spot him. A few spectators scream in horror. 
ICE RINK 
The soprano's mournful aria reaches its crescendo as Smoochy is now pursued by Rhinettes dressed as Nazis. They hold signs with words like "SCANDAL" and "SHAME." Smoochy skates to a section of the rink resembling Chinatown where he lands over a fallen "Moochy." He cradles Moochy's head in his arms as the Nazis glide past him and disappear into the fog. 
NETWORK BOX 
Nora wipes a tear from her eye as she watches the tragedy play out. Burke and Stokes glance skyward. Nora notices this. 
RINK'S EDGE 
Randolph reaches the rink as cops push their way toward him. 
RANDOLPH Sheldon!!! 
But Sheldon can't hear over the orchestra.   The soprano hits a high note. 
CATWALK 
Buggy aims the rifle. 
POV THROUGH RIFLE SCOPE 
Smoochy glides THROUGH the cross-hairs followed by a Rhinette. 
TIGHT ON BUGGY'S FINGER 
as he quickly squeezes off a SHOT. 
RINK 
The MUFFLED sound of GUNSHOT is absorbed by the intense music. A wounded Rhinette falls to the ice, but no one notices. Smoochy, oblivious, continues to skate toward the "gates of heaven" with the angel Moochy. Giant white gates slowly swing open at the rink's far end as floating angels open their arms to welcome Moochy. 
OUTER RINK 
Randolph runs around the rink's perimeter, trying to get Sheldon's attention. Cops and security push their way towards Randolph. He suddenly notices the felled Rhinette on the ice and looks skyward. He can make out a rifle barrel protruding from the catwalk. 
NETWORK BOX 
Stokes and Burke notice a commotion in the audience. They now see Randolph running through the crowd on his way to the stairwell. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
STOKES (whispering to Burke) What's he doing here?! He's going to screw everything up! 
Nora notices the distressed look on their faces and follows their gaze to the rafters. She now sees the rifle barrel. 
ANGLE - NORA 
jumps to her feet.      FAST PUSH IN TO Nora's mouth. 
NORA (screaming) Sheldon!!! 
Buggy crashes into the middle of the rink, cob-webbing the ice around him. 
CATWALK 
Tommy and his boys runs off to find Sheldon. The COPS help Randolph off the catwalk. He's a nervous wreck. 
COP #1 You okay? 
RANDOLPH I don't know. I'm kind of fucked up in general, so it's hard to gauge. 
They pat the dazed Randolph on the back.   He passes out. 
RINK 
People continue to run through the rink. Felled Rhinettes litter the ice like broken dolls. Smoke fills the air. Sheldon is helping a random woman to her feet as Nora finally reaches him. She embraces him. 
NORA Burke's with Stokes.   He's been in it all along. 
Sheldon looks toward the network box. Beyond it, through the smoke, he sees Burke shoving his way through people who jam the exit trying to escape. Sheldon reaches into his costume and pulls out his gun. 
NORA No, Sheldon, don't! 
Sheldon runs off leaving Nora. 
EXIT 
Burke is almost through the cluster of people. He glances over his shoulder and sees Sheldon heading toward him. He shoves even harder now and finally gets through. 
EXT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - CONTINUOUS ACTION 
Burke makes a run for it down 33rd Street. A moment later, Sheldon emerges from the building. He sees Burke in the distance and takes off after him. He's still in his skates and wearing the partially-blown-off Smoochy head. 
FURTHER DOWN STREET 
Burke looks behind and sees the nightmarish image of a disfigured Smoochy chasing after him. He quickly rounds the corner. 
EXT. STREET 
A few moments later Sheldon rounds the corner. He looks down the street and sees no sign of Burke. He notices an alley by an abandoned building. 
EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS ACTION 
Sheldon walks slowly into the alley, gun drawn. Suddenly, Burke jumps out from behind some boxes. He whacks Sheldon's head with a garbage can lid. The gun goes flying. Burke goes for it, but Sheldon is quickly on his feet and pounces on him. The two men fight it out. Burke manages to get on top of Sheldon and starts to strangle him. 
BURKE You fucking point a gun at me? A gun I gave you as a gift?! Where's your fucking etiquette? 
Just as Sheldon begins to lose consciousness, we hear a GUNSHOT. Burke looks up. Nora stands there, pointing Sheldon's gun directly at him. 
NORA Let him go. 
Burke just looks at her. 
NORA Now. Before I pump one in that Grecian Formula scalp of yours. 
Burke smirks as he releases Sheldon. Sheldon jumps up and takes the gun from Nora. He shakily points it at Burke. 
BURKE You know something, kid? You've turned out to be an incredible pain in the ass. 
Burke slowly stands up, brushing off his suit. 
SHELDON You were behind the Spinner hit, weren't you? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BURKE That was a tragic mistake. (shakes head sadly) If only one could turn back time... (beat) But what the hell, it's just one less mick in the world. 
He laughs. 
NORA You son-of-a-bitch. 
Sheldon cocks the gun. 
BURKE Oh my. What are you gonna do? Kill me? That wouldn't be very Smoochy-like behavior. 
SHELDON You're right. There's just one thing... 
Sheldon tears off the remains of his tattered costume and steps out of it. 
SHELDON I'm not Smoochy. 
Sheldon is shaking as he extends the gun to Burke's head. 
SHELDON I finally realized we're living in a different jungle.

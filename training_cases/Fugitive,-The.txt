FADE IN: 
EXT. CHICAGO - AERIAL - NIGHT 
CREDITS BEGIN OVER: 
Snow swirls around the tall buildings of downtown Chicago. 
EXT. CHICAGO HOTEL - NIGHT 
Cars, taxis, limos line the street. A cab pulls up and MAN in tuxedo moves into: 
INT. CHICAGO HOTEL - BALLROOM - NIGHT 
THROUGH arriving guests we PICK UP the Man climbing stairs to the ballroom. 
ANGLE - COAT CHECK 
The Man hands his coat to coat check woman and thanks her. When he turns we get our first view of DR. RICHARD KIMBLE, a tall, athletic man, with a trim beard. 
He moves from the outer lobby into a fabulously decorated ballroom where a fashion show is taking place as a medical fundraiser. Doctors and their spouses, hospital brass and sponsors mingle. Women sit near the runway watching the models. Men talk by the bar. The room is packed. 
A banner over the rostrum says: "CHILDREN'S RESEARCH AND AID FOUNDATION" 
Kimble is handed a glass of champagne, which he promptly sets on another waiter's passing tray. 
ROBERTS (V.O.) Richard... 
DR. ROBERTS, a large surgeon, pulls Kimble over to a group of surgeons gathered around a bar. Smoking cigars. 
ROBERTS Cancun. Nat just talked everybody into it... 
A hospital equipment rep, NAT, is buying drinks. 
KIMBLE So, what's the deal? If the hospital buys ten new - 
NAT No, no, no, no strings attached, Dr. Kimble. Industrial Hospital Supply has no ulterior motives. 
KIMBLE On the house, huh? (to bartender) Tonic water with lime. 
Everyone agrees. 
KIMBLE Never get me to sell my soul for one of those trips... 
His tone silences the group. Kimble takes his drink. 
KIMBLE (to Nat) ... But if you get any more Bulls tickets, Nat, give me a call. 
The group laughs, Kimble extracts himself and CREDITS CONTINUE OVER - 
CUT TO: 
KIMBLE 
Moving through the crowd. 
CUT TO: 
KIMBLE 
Nearly gets hit in the follow-through of an imaginary golf swing. 
KIMBLE You're slicing, Dave. Don't turn your hip. 
He keeps moving. 
GOLFING MAN Thanks, Richard... 
CUT TO: 
ANGLE - TOUGH-LOOKING LAB RAT 
KATHY WAHLUND, totally out of her element amid the formal elegance around her. She wears a leather jacket over T-shirt and stares at the action on the fashion runway. 
DR. WAHLUND (dripping sarcasm) I'm so glad you talked me into coming, Richard... I can pick my cruise wardrobe. 
RICHARD It's for a good cause, Kath... Besides you need to get out of the lab more. Your electron microscope is starting to give you a tan. 
She smiles. He moves on. 
ANGLE - PARTY 
Kimble continues down the bar when he spots a friend... 
KIMBLE Hey, Jim. 
DR. JAMES NICHOLS turns, smiles. Mid-40s, head of the University Hospital. He is a fit contemporary. 
NICHOLS Richard, I just saw someone who wanted to meet you... 
Just then Kimble spots an attractive WOMAN, late thirties, wearing a drop-dead, simple black gown. She's surrounded by a group of men hanging on her every word. She and Kimble catch a look and hold it. 
NICHOLS (V.O.) Richard Kimble... Alex Lentz. Alex is working on the RDU90 trials for Devlin-Macgregor. 
Kimble turns to meet DR. ALEXANDER LENTZ, late 30s, tan, smiling. Lentz extends his hand... 
LENTZ Dr. Kimble... Sorry, we've been trading phone calls last few days ... something about a biopsy report I returned to you? 
KIMBLE (suddenly attentive) Yeah... Three. Livers appeared hepatetic to me. 
LENTZ I'll be in my office in the morning and I'll pull up the samples. Is that a good time for you? 
KIMBLE Sure. 
LENTZ (holds Kimble's look, then to Nichols) See you, Jim. 
FLASH - FORENSICS TECHNICIAN DUSTS CRYSTAL LAMP 
DETECTIVE KELLY Did you have your key with you tonight, Dr. Kimble? 
FLASH - COPS 
Checking doors of house for signs of forcible entry. 
BACK TO SCENE 
PHONE RINGS. Rosetti answers it. Kimble watches him write something down, he slides it to Kelly. 
FLASH - MEASURE "NECKLACE" OF BRUISES ON HELEN'S NECK 
DETECTIVE KELLY (V.O.) Your wife was loaded wasn't she? I mean, she was worth quite a bit of money. 
BACK TO SCENE 
Kimble looks up at the two cops. For the first time he seems to sense something aggressive in their questioning. 
They no longer seem on the same team. 
KIMBLE What's going on here? This guy was trying to rob us. 
The two cops stare at Kimble. 
KIMBLE You guys have got to be out of your minds. I didn't kill my wife! 
He gets up to go. A cop blocks his path. He turns and looks at Kelly. 
DETECTIVE KELLY Let's start over, Dr. Kimble. What'd you have for breakfast? 
CUT TO: 
INT. 11TH ST. POLICE STATION - NIGHT 
Kimble in his tuxedo shirt and black tie holds a booking number plate in front of him as a mug shot is taken... front, then side. 
MAN (V.O.) We're all adults here so I'll lay it out... 
EXT. NEWSSTAND - DAY 
Chicago Sun-Times has a photograph of Kimble spread across the front page. 
MAN (V.O.) ... If you two come up with a deal, I'll listen, but let me make one thing perfectly clear. 
INT. ELECTRONICS SUPERSTORE - DAY 
Salesmen continue to hawk sets. Kimble's photograph comes up on a hundred TV monitors across the store. 
NEWS REPORTER (V.O.) Police are revealing no details in the case against Chicago surgeon... 
INT. KIMBLE'S CELL - DAY 
Kimble lays on his bunk. Thinking... 
MAN (V.O.) ... It's an election year... 
INT. JUDGE'S CHAMBERS - DAY 
CAMERA MOVES THROUGH smoke-fillet room to find tough FEMALE PROSECUTOR, a man in late forties, WALTER GUTHERIE, and STOPS ON the source of the voice we've been hearing and the cigar: JUDGE BENNETT, late fifties. Fair but, no nonsense, political survivor. 
JUDGE BENNETT ... and this case is a heater. It will not end up a bench trial... 
INT. COOK COUNTY JAIL - CORRIDOR - DAY 
Richard Kimble in County lockup fatigues and a navy watch cap moves down long corridor, escorted by GUARD. 
GUTHERIE (V.O.) We've had private investigators interview over a hundred amputees, Richard... 
INT. PRISON INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY 
Walter Gutherie, his attorney, stands by a window looking out at the yard. Another attorney, RANDOLPH, watches Gutherie. 
GUTHERIE ... We can't find this guy. 
KIMBLE I know what I saw, Walter. 
GUTHERIE I put you up on the stand to say what you saw without anything that remotely smells like proof and the State's attorney is going to take this one-armed man story and run it up our ass. (he holds Kimble's look) Look, Richard, you're paying us a lot of money to defend you... A plea to second degree - 
KIMBLE I didn't kill my wife. 
INT. COOK COUNTY JAIL - DAY 
Kimble being escorted back to the courtroom. A guard carries his suit in a bag. He is taunted by other prisoners. 
GUTHERIE (V.O.) You're a successful upper middle class white man charged in a violent crime... 
INT. COOK COUNTY LOCKUP / CHANGE ROOM - DAY 
On the other side of the door is the courtroom. A sheriff's deputy hands Kimble (now wearing his suit), a small plastic bag. In it we see his wedding band. 
GUTHERIE (V.O.) It's a circumstantial case, but it's also a jury trial. We play 'em, they play 'em... 
INT. CHICAGO COURTROOM - DAY 
Richard Kimble sits at defense table... watches prosecutors chat with Helen's relatives. Media anchors glare at him. 
GUTHERIE (V.O.) ... But if we lose, we lose big. Just remember, they're lined up a block long to have your hide. 
HARD CUT TO: 
PHOTOGRAPH OF HELEN KIMBLE'S BODY 
A crime scene photograph. 
DETECTIVE KELLY 
On the stand. 
DETECTIVE KELLY No forcible entry was found. From the beginning of the investigation, it did not appear to be a break-in. Nothing was missing. 
FORENSICS TECHNICIAN 
The chain gang exits through the sally port. Kimble and three other prisoners. Jailers escort them to... 
An Illinois Department of Corrections guard moves alongside, checking the undercarriage with a pole-mounted mirror.

Locking wire mesh cage inside bus. 
An old DIESEL COUGHS to life. 
EXT. COOK COUNTY JAIL - NIGHT 
Main gates open. The BUS GRINDS onto the streets. 
INT. BUS - DAY 
The four prisoners sit scattered, still cuffed but no longer chained together. Near the front, PRISONER #1 is eyeing... 
The two prison guards seated beyond the caged door. YOUNG GUARD lighting a smoke. OLD GUARD drowsing. Shotguns bouncing on their knees. Prisoner #l shifts his gaze to... 
The driver. Pistol on his hip. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. DESOLATE HIGHWAY - NIGHT 
The BUS RUMBLES north, heading towards the horizon. 
INT. BUS - NIGHT 
PRISONER #1 rises. Through caging: 
PRISONER #1 Hey. Illinois penal regulations require a meal for transport rides of four hours or more. 
Young Guard shakes his head. "Fucking jailhouse lawyers." Checks his watch: 4:00. 
YOUNG GUARD Jack! Feedin' time. 
Old Guard yawns to his feet, unhooks a key-ring from his belt. Young Guard stows his shotgun in the weapons locker. 
PRISONER #2 looks at Kimble. Kimble stirs awake... watches the cage door open, Young Guard moving back. And across the aisle... 
PRISONER #3, a big man named COPELAND, wags his head between his knees. Something slides out of his shirt and CLANKS to the dimpled steel floor. It's a razor sharp plastic shank. 
Heart quickening, Kimble looks forward. Young Guard is handing a petrified sandwich to Prisoner #1. Kimble snaps a look back to Copeland, who palms the shank. 
COPELAND Breathe, and you're first. 
Old Guard watches from the open cage door, shotgun carelessly ready. 
Young Guard reaches Kimble and extends a sandwich. Kimble doesn't respond. 
YOUNG GUARD Suit yourself. 
He offers the sandwich to Copeland. In the exchange, sandwich drops. Copeland leans down for it. 
Up front, Old Guard yawns again just as... 
KIMBLE Look out! 
Too late... Jackknifing up, Copeland drives the shank into Young Guard's gut. 
Prisoner #2 dives for Young Guard's holster. As the gun comes out, Young Guard gets a hand on it. A SHOT FIRES... 
Jolting Old Guard. He chambers his shotgun. Kimble hits the floor. The Old Guard jams a key into the cage door and surges inside, but... 
Prisoner #1 broadsides Old Guard. SHOTGUN DISCHARGES... Opening a big Gainsburger hole in the driver. He sinks under the steering wheel. A knee hits the accelerator. 
The CAGE DOOR SLAMS locked behind the Old Guard. 
EXT. DESOLATE HIGHWAY - NIGHT 
As the bus careens off the road, accelerating. 
INT. BUS - NIGHT 
Young Guard wrestles gun from Prisoner #2 and FIRES, killing prisoner #2. Copeland grapples with wounded Young Guard. 
Old Guard shotgun-butts Prisoner #1, flips the gun, PUMPS ONE ROUND into the man's chest. Dead. He turns just as... 
EXT. OPEN LAND - NIGHT 
As the driverless BUS BUCKS ant BANGS over open ground. 
INT. BUS - NIGHT 
Old Guard reloads. Copeland drops down behind a seat. 
Old Guard jams his SHOTGUN under the seat. But just as the Old Guard pulls the trigger the bus jerks. The SHOT goes off target as... 
EXT. OPEN LAND - NIGHT 
The BUS ROARS into a gravel embankment. ROARS up the slope and CRASHES down on its side - sliding to a stop at the bottom of a small ravine. 
INT. BUS - NIGHT 
ENGINE DIES. Dusty silence. We don't know up from down. 
On his knees, Old Guard makes his way to the driver. Finds him dead. Now a SOUND. Old Guard whips his shotgun around at... 
Kimble. Rising between the seats. 
A hairy beat. Old Guard might kill him just to finish things off. But a GROAN turns Old Guard's head. 
Young Guard, trying to hold his guts in. Old Guart turns to find Kimble. 
OLD GUARD (to Kimble) You. You're a doctor. C'mere. 
He slides to the Young Guard as the Old Guard scrounges up a medical kit, shoves Kimble down on Young Guard. 
EXT. CRASH SITE (SOUTHERN ILLINOIS) - NIGHT 
News and sheriff's department choppers circle billowing smoke. TILT DOWN to reveal the derailed train. Fire engines hose down the blackened locomotive. Rescue workers work feverishly with jaws-of-life to get into the mangled wreckage. Illuminated by spotlights, transportation investigators in blue coveralls pick through the twisted remains of the bus. State troopers restrain spectators. 
Two American-made rental cars pull up. Four deputy U.S. marshals emerge: 
BIGGS. Swaggering Midwestern carnivore. Built like a brick shithouse. 
RENFRO. Bantam-rooster of a man, no more than 140 pounds fully-equipped. 
POOLE. Black woman. Nobody minds having her around during nut-cuttin' time. 
NEWMAN, a scrub-faced G-5. 
From the second car steps GERARD. He takes in the media spectacle. 
GERARD Good lord... 
REFRO What is this... a circus? 
As a group they begin moving along the service road above the crash site. Derailed train cars are accortianed below them. They take in the elements of the crash and as they walk each begins to reveal their U.S. Marshal's credentials. 
Biggs spots something... 
BIGGS Point of impact. 
... and branches off. 
GERARD Biggs, your turn to babysit Newman. 
BIGGS Shit. (to Newman) Come on. 
They drop down to the crash site. Poole ant Renfro remain with Gerard. 
A state TROOPER steps into their path, but falls away when he sees Gerard's Marshall star. 
GERARD How ya doing? Who's in charge? 
TROOPER Sheriff Rollins. Just follow the lights - 
Gerard follows his point to where TV lights illuminate the scene. He shakes his head - it doesn't please him. 
Renfro and Poole share a look, they seem to know what's about to happen. 
ANGLE - OLD GUARD 
Seated near a tree. A space blanket draped over his shoulders. He is surrounded by EMT personnel, and a YOUNG SHERIFF, clearly basking in the event. Television remote news crews are kept only slight back. Gerard appears in the b.g., listening. 
OLD GUARD ... train was bearin' down on us, fast. I don't know how - it's still kind of hazy - but I grabbed him and pushed him out of the bus. 
SHERIFF You coulda both been killed. 
OLD GUARD I know, but hell, he's my partner. Woulda done the same for me. 
The young Sheriff in charge nods, buying the story. Gerard eases forward, displays his badge, interrupts. 
GERARD Excuse me, Sheriff Rollins? Deputy U.S. Marshal Samuel Gerard. 
SHERIFF (annoyed) I'll be with you in a minute. 
The television lights widen to illuminate Gerard. He shields his eyes. The Sheriff opens a file and produces fax-photos of all four prisoners. 
SHERIFF (to Old Guard) For the record. These three dead. And this one... 
He switches to a photo of Kimble. 
OLD GUARD Well, everything happened so fast... (bites lip, decides) Huh-uh. Don't think he made it. 
Sheriff eyes the wreckage that could entomb a hundred prisoners, then files Kimble's fax-photo with the others. 
SHERIFF You get some rest. 
He pats the Guard on the shoulder and approaches Gerard. 
SHERIFF Looks like you came a long way for nothing. My men've already done a thorough search from point of impact and found nothing. 
INTERCUT WITH: 
ANGLE - CULVERT 
Biggs and Newman stop by the muddy culvert. Biggs sees something. He orders Newman into the muck after it. 
GERARD 
Aware of media, proceeds patiently with the young Sheriff. 
GERARD With all due respect, may I suggest check-points starting at a 15-mile radius on I-57, I-24, Route 13 east of - 
SHERIFF Whoa, whoa, whoa... For what? Prisoners are all dead. The only thing check-points will do is get a lot of good people out here frantic and flood my office with calls. 
Gerard finally touches eyeballs with the young Sheriff and we get our first taste of Gerard at close range. 
GERARD (beat) Well, shit, Sheriff, I'd hate for that to happen... So, I'll be taking over the investigation. 
SHERIFF On whose authority? 
GERARD By authority of the Governor of the State of Illinois and the office of the United States Marshal, 5th District Northern Illinois... 
Poole produces State and Federal authorization documents from one of her pockets and hands it to the young Sheriff. 
SHERIFF (back-down beat) Okay. You want jurisdiction over this mess, you got it. (to assistants) Shut it down. Wyatt Earp is here to mop up for us. 
He slaps the file of fax-photos at Gerard on his way out. Just as Biggs, spotless, eases ino the group with Kimble's manacles. Behind Biggs we see Newman, covered in mud. 
Seeing the leg irons, the Sheriff and his deputies pile to a stop. Now Gerard takes his run at Old Guard. 
GERARD Please, ladies and gentlemen, step back and give this poor man some room. 
Like an obedient dog the press backs off, they sense a change of story and command. 
Gerard kneels down with Poole and Renfro in front of the Old Guard. The Sheriff hovers near. 
GERARD (friendly, to Old Guard) Always an interesting thing when we find leg irons and no legs in them who held the keys, sir? 
CUT TO: 
INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - LONG SHOT (MOS) - MORNING 
At far end of the hall we see a STATE TROPER chatting with a DUTY NURSE at a nurses' station.

Kimble, his bandage already in place, gives himself a shot of antibiotics. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HOSPITAL - MAN'S ROOM - DAY 
A man, tube in nose, on two I.V.s, lays in bed with eyes closed. Kimble comes INTO FRAME near his face. 
KIMBLE Can you hear me, sir? 
No response. The man is out of it. Kimble backtracks to the patient's closet and opens it. Hanging inside we see his clothes. He removes them and notices the man's untouched breakfast tray. 
CUT TO: 
INT. RURAL HOSPITAL - NURSES' DUTY STATION - DAY 
The Duty Nurse and State Trooper chat when a fax begins coming through on DESK FAX.

His arm slowly reaches out and presses his nurses call button. 
CUT TO: 
INT. NURSES' STATION - DAY 
A fax photograph of Richard Kimble slowly comes off the duty station FAX MACHINE. Next to the machine the patient's call light comes on. 
The Duty Nurse, standing with the Highway Trooper, sees the patient's light come on and starts down the hall toward the patient's room. 
CUT TO: 
INT. PATIENT'S BATHROOM - DAY 
Kimble shaving when we hear the DUTY NURSE ENTER the patient's room. He moves OUT OF FRAME. 
DUTY NURSE (O.S.) Mr. Patterson, do you need some more water? 
ANGLE - MAN'S EATEN BREAKFAST 
The Duty Nurse looks from the tray to the man, impressed. 
DUTY NURSE ... Oh, you did a good job on this. 
She takes his empty plastic pitcher and... 
... pushes open the bathroom door - no sign of Kimble - and refills the pitcher from the sink. 
DUTY NURSE (over her shoulder, to patient) ... It does get dry in here, doesn't it? 
She doesn't expect an answer, turns OFF the WATER, and goes into the main room. As the door closes we see Kimble behind it. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - DAY 
Kimble, clean-shaven, and wearing the patient's glasses and a doctor's white coat, moves down the hall to the emergency room exit. Suddenly the State Trooper steps back from the E.R. admissions desk with his newly received fax, and starts down the corridor toward Kimble. 
The Trooper looks up as the two men pass... 
TROOPER 'Scuse me, Doc?... 
Kimble turns but continues slowly backing toward the E.R. doors behind him. 
TROOPER ... Don't know if you heard or not but we're looking for an escaped prisoner from that bus train wreck 'couple hours ago. Thought he might show up here if he was hurt. 
KIMBLE What's he look like? 
The Trooper looks down at his fact sheet as we see a slow trickle of blood from a shaving nick begin winding down Kimble's cheek. 
TROOPER (from fax sheet) Approximately six one, 180 pounds, brown hair, brown eyes and beard. 
At the last second Kimble feels the drop of blood and wipes it clean as the Trooper looks up. 
TROOPER ... Seen anyone that fits that description? 
KIMBLE Every time I look in the mirror ... but without the beard. 
They laugh. 
KIMBLE Excuse me... 
TROOPER Sure. 
Kimble moves through the E.R. doors as an ambulance parks outside... 
EXT. RURAL HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM RAMP - DAY 
Two PARAMEDICS try to take out a patient on a gurney. The lead wheels are stuck. 
KIMBLE Here... 
Kimble helps clear the wheels so the collapsible gurney comes free. 
PARAMEDIC #2 Thanks, Doc, we had to dig him out from under a train. 
EXT. CRASH SITE - DAY 
Poole hangs up phone. 
POOLE Ambulance just spotted two miles west of Doverville. Heading north on State road 53. 
Renfro turns to the map and marks it. The circle is much smaller. 
RENFRO Running outta map, Sam. 
The crash site and hospital are already marked. Gerard is ready to move. 
GERARD Just the way we want it. Okay, people, let's button up. 
They move off to waiting State Trooper cars and helicopter. 
INT. AMBULANCE - DAY 
Kimble driving down a rural road. He flips down visor and eyeballs folded roadmap...

EXT. HIGHWAY (KENTUCKY) - DAY 
Blowing other traffic off the road, WHOOPING CRUISERS and G-cars stream south through the rugged rural terrain of Southern Illinois. Overtaking them all, a CHOPPER THUNDERS overhead. 
INT. HELICOPTER 
Heading into hilly terrain. Down below we see the ambulance. Inside the helicopter Gerard eyes the terrain. 
PILOT (into radio) We've got a visual... (to Gerard) He's heading toward the viaduct. 
GERARD Seal it up. 
EXT. AERIAL VIEW OF GROSVNER VIADUCT - DAY 
The two-lane road disappears into long tunnel. Three hundred feet below the road tumbles the Tennessee River. 
The Barkley Dam rises ahead. Kimble's AMBULANCE ROARS into the tunnel. 
ON KIMBLE 
Suddenly sees the helicopter setting down ahead of him at the mouth of the tunnel. 
Kimble slams on brakes and turns to retreat. 
ANGLE - FAR END OF TUNNEL (BEHIND HIM) 
Illinois Highway Patrol cars pull to a stop at the far entrance. Light flares. Set out road blocks. 
ANGLE HELICOPTER 
Gerard steps out followed by Renfro and Poole. 
KIMBLE'S AMBULANCE 
Comes to a stop, blocking traffic in both directions. Immediately HORNS begin BLARING. 
EXT. TUNNEL - NIGHT 
Trooper pulls up. Biggs and Newman behind Kimble blocking the other end. 
Troopers with guns drawn block the exits. The P.A. from a State patrol car blares: 
P.A. (V.O.) Please remain in your vehicles and lock your doors. Repeat, please remain in - 
ANGLE ON HELICOPTER 
Poole and Renfro materialize already decked out in Kevlar. They're jacked up and ready to rock. Renfro hands Gerard a vest. 
RENFRO Got him. 
Gerard unholsters a 40 caliber, Glock model 22. 
GERARD Okay, ladies and gentlemen hard part's over. 
He starts into the tunnel. 
RENFRO (to radio) We're movin' in. 
INT. TUNNEL - DAY 
Weapons drawn, but held discreetly at their sides, three silhouettes enter. Drivers who hadn't heeded the Troopers' P.A. warnings take one look at Gerard and quickly climb back inside and lock their doors. 
Biggs, Renfro and Poole fan out to the sides and give the middle to Gerard. The tunnel is quickly quiet. 
Kimble huddles at mid-tunnel. He's trapped. Drops to the ground beneath the truck. His heart pounding, brain clicking, fighting panic. Suddenly he realizes he's in water. 
Running water. 
ON MARSHALS 
They reach the mid-tunnel area. No Kimble. Biggs looks around, beneath vehicles. Gerard listens. Poole looks confused. 
POOLE Where'd he go? 
Gerard spots the trickle of water. He backtracks it until he finds a loose grate in the pavement. Man-size. 
GERARD Biggs, Renfro with me. 
INT. STORM DRAIN - FORKING CONDUIT - DAY 
Kimble splashes blindly through ankle-deep sluice. He slows at forking tunnels to catch his breath and pick a direction. A DULL ROAR comes from somewhere - from everywhere. He whips off his jacket and slings it down a tunnel, then continues straight ahead. 
Somewhere behind, lights probe splash-patterns on the conduit wall - telltale signs of Kimble's passing. The lights belong to... 
Gerard, Biggs and Renfro. They push on, soon reaching the forking tunnels. Renfro finds the jacket ant splash signs. 
GERARD Channel Three. 
They conform their radios. Splitting up, Biggs and Renfro go left. Gerard - straight ahead. 
HEAD TROOPER Running out of daylight, Inspector. 
GERARD Lights and generators are coming, Captain. 
HEAD TROOPER Look, I don't mean to tell you your job, but maybe one person in a million could've survived that fall. The guy's fish food. 
Gerard turns and brings his look to bear on the Captain. 
GERARD Then find me the fish that ate him. 
He turns and heads to a waiting helicopter. 
EXT. WOODS - AFTERNOON 
Kimble runs through the woods. He staggers, his arm hooks a sapling which spins him to the ground. He lays motionless, exhausted.

Kimble comes out of his sleep with a start. Shivering. He remembers where he is. His breathing returns to normal. 
EXT. TRESTLE - TUNNEL - MORNING 
Kimble moves across a river trestle and disappears into tunnel. 
INT. DRUG STORE - DAY 
Kimble on pay phone in the rear of the store waits for party to answer. An old lady and her mother shop. 
Across the store a pharmacist watches Kimble. 
ANGLE - PHONE 
Kimbles watches the boys as he waits for answer. We hear RINGING, then a receptionist answers: 
RECEPTIONIST (V.O.) The law offices of Gutherie, Morgan and Wainwright. 
KIMBLE Walter Gutherie please. 
RECEPTIONIST (V.O.) I'm sorry, Mr. Gutherie has left for the day, would you like his voice mail? 
Kimble hangs up and moves down an aisle, stopping in front of the hair color. He takes a box of black hair dye off the shelf and looks at the instructions. When he looks up he sees the pharmacist looking at him. 
EXT. SONNY'S DINER - NIGHT 
A roadside diner. Kimble, his hair now black, and wearing a new pair of Wranglers, hooded sweatshirt and a duffle coat, moves down the road to the diner. 
INT. SONNY'S DINER - NIGHT 
Kimble enters. He sits at the counter and a sparky OLDER WAITRESS, late, mid-forties, with strong good looks and tough smile fills his coffee cup before he even asks. 
OLDER WAITRESS Need to look at the menu? 
KIMBLE Some soup, please. 
OLDER WAITRESS Good choice. 
She marks her pad and leaves. Sights ant sounds around Kimble begins to occupy his attention: 
A dishwasher buses a tub of dishes back to the kitchen. He stares at him. 
A farmer sitting at a table stares at Kimble, Kimble looks away. A man at the pay phone seems to be staring at him. Is he calling the police? Everyone seems to be looking at him. 
Someone stops in front of him. A young waitress serves him his soup. Where's the first waitress? 
Takes a few sips of soup. Out of the corner of his eye he sees: 
The Older Waitress putting on her coat to leave. Is she going to report him? He fights the paranoia. 
A NEWS REPORT on the TELEVISION gets his attention. 
ANGLE - TV 
A report on the escape. A television reporter describes the chase for Kimble; his jump at the dam and his presumed death from the fall. 
Kimble decides it's time to leave. He drops some money on the counter and exits. 
EXT. DINER - NIGHT 
NURSE FLYNN, a woman about 45, attractive, smart, loyal. 
Poole and Gerard talk to her in an examination room. 
FLYNN I ran his office for twelve years. Yes, we were very close. But he wouldn't come to me for help. 
INT. COOK COUNTY HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - DAY 
Busy with doctors, orderlies and street people. Kimble moves down hallway and enters. 
INT. PROSTHETIC CLINIC - WAITING ROOM - DAY 
He moves into the room and takes a new patient form, looks around. SEE BACK INTO the office area of the clinic. It could be any hospital clinic from this view. 
But as Kimble turns to leave we see a PATIENT waiting to be called. On his lap we see a prosthetic arm. Kimble looks up from the arm to the man. 
PATIENT Good morning. 
KIMBLE Good morning. 
As he turns to leave we hear: 
ROBERTS (V.O.) Don't underestimate this guy...

Gerard walks through Kimble's house. The art and most of the furniture is gone. Books are in boxes and shopping bags around the room. Plastic covers the remaining pieces of furniture.

INT. COOK COUNTY HOSPITAL - JANITOR'S ROOM - DAY 
Kimble moves past the lockers, racks and boxes of cleaning supplies, stops at a board listing work schedules, vacation leaves, locker numbers. Behind him a LOCKER SLAMS. As a janitor moves off to the showers we see his locker did not close but remains slightly ajar from the impact.

KIMBLE They just sent this one up. 
He takes a look at the Boy's chart and grabs the X-rays and yells to O.R. nurse. 
SURGEON Bob! Get this one into room four, stat. 
He looks up, Kimble is gone. 
INT. PROSTHETIC CLINIC - COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT 
Kimble enters the Prosthetic Clinic computer room. The Technician from the day before is listening to her Walkman, sees Kimble and waves. Kimble waves back and turns into the glass-walled computer room and closes the door.

The crisis has wound down. Anne moves into the room and begins checking patients. She stops a unit nurse, GLADYS.

GLADYS He never came in here. 
INT. PROSTHETIC CLINIC - COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT 
Kimble scans DOS files, each an eight-letter enigma. Finds one with promise and loads it up.

Kimble knows he's got it.

ANNE I saw - 
SURGEON (in a hurry now) Whoever did knew what the hell he was doing. Kid's a hair away from a ruptured aorta.

KIMBLE Seventy-five. Hell, yes. 
Kimble types in another defining characteristic... Residence: Illinois.

Kimble stands on a sidewalk, staring at the imposing edifice across the street. After a here-we-go breath, he starts through traffic. 
INT. FEDERAL LOCKUP - LOBBY - DAY 
Kimble waits for an elevator. It opens to reveal a pack of staring COPS. 
ELEVATOR COP (catching door) Comin' or not? 
Forcing his feet to move, Kimble boards... 
INT. FEDERAL LOCKUP - ELEVATOR - DAY 
... and pivots quickly. Elevator rises. Floor-indicator moves deathly slow. 
Kimble feels the breath of a dozen COPS on his neck. And just when his floor is mercifully about to arrive... 
Overhead lights flicker, and the elevator jars to a stop between floors. 
COPS Aw, shit... Not now... Anybody bring a deck of cards? 
Abruptly they're moving again. Kimble's heart restarts with the elevator. 
INT. FEDERAL LOCKUP - VISITATION AREA - DAY

Gerard and Biggs cross the lobby and stop in front of the desk; flash their U.S. Marshal's ID. 
GERARD (to clerk) We need to see a prisoner. 
DESK CLERK Fifth floor. 
Kimble closing in on the door when suddenly a KLAXON HORN sounds. 
People stop in confusion. Automatically, the exit doors begin closing. Biggs pushes his way off the elevator. Kimble breaks into a sprint for the door. 
GERARD 
Bursts out the stairwell door after Kimble. 
GERARD Kimble. Stop! 
But there's only one way of stopping Kimble. 
KIMBLE 
Enters the revolving doors as a big man enters from the outside. The big man sizes up the situation, realizes Kimble is fleeing and just before Kimble exits - yanks on the door - trapping him partially inside the revolving door. 
Other doors seal electronically. Biggs charges back, sees Gerard. 
Kimble fights the heavy glass door. The big man resists - but slowly the crack widens. Gerard bulls through the crowd, shoves a man out of his line of fire. 
GERARD Down. down. everybody down! 
With adrenal effort, Kimble wrings his body through the opening... 
EXT. FEDERAL LOCKUP - DAY 
... and makes it outside - except for his foot - caught like in a bear trap, as the door locks down. Harrowed, Kimble looks back over his shoulder at... 
Gerard. Charging the glass doors. Civilians suck marble and clear out of Gerard's line of fire on Kimble. Gerard takes aim. 
GERARD Kimble. Stop! 
It's Kimble's nightmare coming true. If he could chew off his leg right now, he would. He pulls at his foot just as 
INT. FEDERAL LOCKUP - DAY 
Gerard FIRES seven times in two seconds. 
Kimble goes down. SHOTS and SCREAMS ECHO around the lobby. A long beat, then Gerard rises. THROUGH GLASS studded with bullet holes, he sees... 
Kimble rising... staring back. Equally astounded that he's alive. He runs free. 
GERARD Open the doors! 
Gerard pounds against the doors. Sees cratering in the glass - and then sees flattened slugs all over the floor. It's bullet-proof glass. THROUGH the glass he sees Kimble rush across the street and disappear into the parade. 
Doors open and Gerard and his men follow. 
But Kimble has disappeared into the parade celebrations outside. Blending in with the marchers. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. HOTEL - MORNING 
Kimble leaves a cheap hotel early the next morning. He wears a new set of clothes - jeans, sport coat and tie - than the day before, and the black hair coloring has been rinsed from his hair. He moves down the street.

KIMBLE'S POV - APARTMENT HOUSE 
Across the street. 
INT. SYKES' APARTMENT - MORNING 
Inside the apartment the PHONE RINGS. No one is home. 
INT. BAR - MORNING 
The PHONE RINGS nine, ten times. As Kimble waits he looks down at his list of five. The only name remaining is Fredrick Sykes. 
He looks down the street - it seems clear - then his focus shifts to a man carrying two coffees. He approaches a car parked along the curb. The passenger - a woman - leans across the seat and opens the door for him. 
He hands her a cup of coffee and as he starts to climb in, he shifts something on his hip - we see the butt of a handgun. 
Kimble hangs up and leaves through the back door. 
EXT. REAR OF SYKES' APARTMENT - MORNING 
Kimble moves across the roof and drops to fire escape behind Sykes' apartment. He looks in the window, steps back to see if anyone is looking, then pulls his fist back into his sleeve and with one swift pop, BREAKS the GLASS. 
INT. SYKES' APARTMENT - KITCHEN - MORNING 
No sound. Slowly he moves into... 
HALLWAY 
Moving first toward the living room. The apartment is modest. 
He stops by a photograph of a teenage girl. Another is a boy in football uniform. The next one is a man in a police uniform. Kimble freezes.

GERARD (into phone) You can't control this thing, Kimble... Kimble? 
He thinks he hears FOOTSTEPS over the phone, realizes Kimble has not hung up. What's Kimble doing? 
GERARD (to Renfro) Where is he? 
Renfro looks up from the address to Gerard, stunned. 
RENFRO (incredulous) Holy shit. We've got a car there right now. 
He picks up a phone.

The Forensic Tech sits at desk. 
FORENSIC TECH Kimble's prints are all over the apartment, but the concentration is here. 
The Tech takes out the check stubs, some papers; the pack of photos.

The Tech flips through the pack, stops on the Lentz/Sykes photos. 
FORENSIC TECH He flips through the pack but paused here. 
He hands the Lentz/Sykes photo.

Gerard stares at the photo as his RADIO SQUAWKS. 
BIGGS (V.O.) (on radio) Here he comes... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SYKES' APARTMENT - SIDEWALK - DAY 
Fredrick Sykes, the one-armed man, comes down the side walk. He passes a car and hears the door open behind him. Biggs climbs out of the car and falls into step behind him. 
Sykes hears the footsteps but moves on up the stoop and starts to enter his apartment, notices the front door already open. 
Cops and Marshals in his house. Processing a crime scene. 
SYKES What the hell's going on here? Who are you people? 
He steps... 
INT. SYKES' APARTMENT - DAY 
... sees Gerard in the kitchen. Gerard stares at Sykes. 
GERARD You had a break-in, Mr. Sykes. 
SYKES You a cop? 
GERARD My name is Gerard. U.S. Marshal's Office. 
Sykes is caught off guard. 
GERARD This morning a fugitive named Richard Kimble made a call from your apartment. 
Sykes is dumbfounded. 
SYKES Richard Kimble... I don't know a Richard Kim - 
Poole produces a photo of Kimble. 
SYKES Wait a minute... This is the doctor who killed his wife... He claimed the killer had a prosthetic limb. You telling me he's coming after me? 
GERARD Would he have a reason to? 
SYKES What the hell's that supposed to mean? Because I have this? 
He lifts his prosthetic arm and stares at Gerard. Gerard holds his look. 
SYKES Look, a year ago some people came to see me. They asked me questions about the night of the murder and I'll tell you the same thing I told them. I wasn't even in town then. I was on a business trip. 
Gerard continues moving around the apartment. 
The group of deputies and Gerard assemble around Gerard's information board. They've come armed with facts and theories. Gerard orchestrates the information. 
RENFRO If you were Richard Kimble... Why would you hunt for a one-armed man you think killed your wife; find hint then leave him and call us? 
POOLE To throw us off his trail. 
RENFRO Unless... What if you were a well respected surgeon and wanted to kill your wife? How would you do it? 
BIGGS I'd hire a pro. Sight unseen. 
POOLE Set it up to look like a robbery gone bad. 
RENFRO How would you find him? Look in the phone book? 
RENFRO Through a connection. 
POOLE Maybe through a company you did some business with. 
BIGGS Like a pharmaceutical company. Someone in security. 
NEWMAN On the night of his wife's murder, Kimble attended a hospital benefit sponsored by Devlin-Macgregor Pharmaceutical - Sykes' company. 
Gerard places a Devlin-Macgregor card onto his board. 
BIGGS But Sykes claims he was out of town. 
POOLE And company records support that he was on a business trip. 
RENFRO That's an easy fix. So let's say he was in town. Did the job. Everything goes as planned with one problem. 
NEWMAN Instead of looking like a robbery gone bad, Kimble ends up being the one accused... 
BIGGS ... tried, convicted... 
POOLE ... and the hit man gets away clean. 
RENFRO So Kimble returns to hunt for and find the hit man. 
NEWMAN Why? To share the blame? He'd still go to prison. 
Gerard moves to the board. He takes down a card. 
RENFRO You're underestimating the power of the good doctor. It would be his word against... Sykes'. Who would you believe? 
BIGGS So what does Kimble do next? 
RENFRO Get help. 
Gerard pins the card to the board and looks at Renfro. It says: "NICHOLS" 
GERARD Stevens, check phone records for Sykes and Kimble. 
Gerard moves to the door and Renfro follows. As he's leaving he hands the photo of Lentz and Sykes to Biggs. 
GERARD Find out who this guy is. 
He leaves. Biggs hands the photo to Newman. 
NEWMAN (deadpan) Why do I get all the great jobs?

Roosevelt working near the autopsy tables when the two marshals enter. 
NEWMAN Are you Mr. Roosevelt? 
ROOSEVELT Yes. 
BIGGS We're United States Marshals. We're trying to find out some information about a pathologist, named Lentz. He used to be on staff here. 
Roosevelt suddenly goes on the defensive. 
ROOSEVELT He's dead. 
NEWMAN Yeah, we heard. We wanted to know if he knew or had any contact with Dr. Richard Kimble? 
On the mention of Kimble, Roosevelt becomes visibly nervous. 
ROOSEVELT I... I haven't seen Dr. Kimble. 
Biggs and Newman exchange a look. 
NEWMAN (a probe) That's not what I asked, sir. I just wanted to know if Dr. Kimble and Dr. Lentz knew each other? 
ROOSEVELT I... I don't know. Excuse me, I got to go. 
He moves away from the autopsy table. Biggs stops him. 
BIGGS I think you're lying to us.

INT. CHICAGO MEMORIAL - DR. WAHLUND'S LAB - AFTERNOON 
As Kathy packs up evidence, Kimble looks through the reports. 
KIMBLE They'd be home free if I hadn't been leaning on them to account for the livers I was seeing. And I wouldn't have seen the livers if I hadn't told the guys on my service to call me when they had cases that were bleeding excessively in surgery. 
WAHLUND Big bucks. One schmuck standing in the way. Easy, get rid of him and his wife. But why Lentz? 
KIMBLE Why not? He's one of the original patent holders. Toss the samples I sent, replace them with healthy samples, issue the path report on the healthy stuff-piece of cake. 
Kimble notices something in the report. 
KIMBLE When did Lentz die? 
WAHLUND Oh, last summer sometime. August... Why? 
Kimble looks up from the protocol report. 
KIMBLE Because a good third of the samples Lentz approved were signed after he died. 
Kathy comes to look at the report. Lentz's signature is on reports dated October, November, December. 
KIMBLE Someone else used Lentz's name. 
WAHLUND A pathologist at Devlin-Macgregor? 
KIMBLE They wouldn't have had the access. They would have needed someone at the hospital. 
Kimble opens the Devlin-Macgregor prospectus he took from the medical library and opens it to the beginning. A photo gets his attention. 
He takes the bag and starts for the door. 
WAHLUND Where are you going? 
KIMBLE To see an old friend.

SYKES This is my stop, Doc. 
Kimble stares hard at Sykes. He steps toward the side exit. 
KIMBLE Good, it's my stop, too. 
Suddenly the door behind Sykes opens and the Transit Cop enters. 
TRANSIT COP Kimble. (to Sykes) Sir, move away from him. 
Sykes - the gun tucked next to his side - turns. 
The Cop sees Sykes' gun, reacts... 
But Sykes FIRES first, shoots the cop FOUR TIMES. 
As the Cop falls, Sykes turns quickly to finish Kimble. But Kimble pulls the emergency brake over the door.

EXT. TRAIN - NIGHT 
The train stops just short of the station. Only the first two windows of the front car are over the platform. 
INT. KIMBLE'S CAR - NIGHT 
Sykes is thrown to the floor - the gun slips from his grasp. Kimble moves for the gun as Sykes comes up, catches Kimble in the stomach, knocks him back. The fight carries on throughout the car. 
Kimble reaches the gun first, lifts it in his left hand and aims at Sykes. Sykes sees the gun in Kimble's hand and almost smiles. 
SYKES Go ahead. You don't have it in you . 
For a moment Kimble almost fires, but instead he takes the gun in his right hand and whips it across Sykes' face. Then hits Sykes again and again with the butt of the gun, driving him down the length of the car, knocking him almost unconscious. 
Kimble tucks the gun in his belt and moves to the Transit Cop. He checks for a pulse - there is none. The Cop is dead. 
Kimble takes the handcuffs and keys from the case on the Cop's belt. He reaches for Sykes' wrist, drags him to the Cop and cuffs Sykes to the dead Cop. 
He pockets the keys and grabs Sykes' hair, pulls his face off the floor. 
KIMBLE Not as easy as Helen, was it? (slams Sykes' head down, leaves) You missed your stop. 
He moves to the front of the car with Sykes' and the Transit Cop's guns out. People back out of his way. He moves to where the first two windows extend over the platform, kicks out the front window and...

Newman branches off to Hotel Security. The rest follow Gerard to the rooftop elevators.

ROARING over Chicago skyline. The bright red sign of the Hilton Hotel looms ahead. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HALLWAY / HOSPITALITY SUITE - NIGHT 
Nichols moves down hallway and turns into a hospitality suite. A moment later Kimble follow and enters the... 
HOSPITALITY SUITE 
... and is immediately smashed with a chair by Nichols. Kimble goes flying, stunned. Nichols locks the door. 
NICHOLS Your best quality, Richard, is that you don't give up - 
Nichols pulls Kimble to his feet. 
NICHOLS ... even when it's clearly in your best interest to... 
He hits him again, drives him back into the library. 
Kimble tries to recover as Nichols relentlessly stays on him. He pulls him up, slams him against the fire escape doors. 
NICHOLS I always knew that I'd have to kill you. 
He drives a blow into Kimble's stomach. 
NICHOLS Now, I must thank you for giving me 200 witnesses tonight who will support me... when I tell them it was self-defense... 
He shoves Kimble through the door out into... 
EXT. FIRE ESCAPE BALCONY - NIGHT 
... and almost over the railing. Kimble grabs the rail to keep from dropping to the street. Nichols closes on him, but Kimble rolls away at the last minute and knocks Nichols back against the other side of fire escape. 
KIMBLE You missed your chance, Charlie... 
Nichols charges Kimble, but Kimble drives him back with two crushing blows that send Nichols down the stairs. 
Kimble moves down the stairs after him - passing under a security camera. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SECURITY ROOM - NIGHT 
A room lined with security monitors. Two security personnel sit in front of their console. Newman stands behind them. 
On screen: We see Kimble moving down the stairs toward Nichols, who pulls himself to his feet. 
Newman stands in front of the screen, talks to his radio. 
NEWMAN (to radio) I've got Kimble on the roof with Nichols. Southeast exit. 
INTERCUT WITH:

GERARD I want them covered. 
EXT. HOTEL ROOFTOP FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT 
Nichols rises to his feet, swings, but Kimble blocks the blow and lands another that sends Nichols down another set of stairs to the roof. 
KIMBLE You took everything away from me... for money. 
INT. BALLROOM ELEVATORS - NIGHT 
Gerard and the marshals reach the ballroom floor. The elevator doors open to a flood of confused and disoriented doctors trying to escape. The marshals wade through, meet up with two hotel security guards. 
GERARD This way. 
EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT 
Kimble pulls Nichols to his feet. They are silhouetted by the lights of the city skyline. 
KIMBLE I want to know, Charlie... was it worth it...? 
NICHOLS This thing is bigger than even you think, Richard. You can't stop it. 
He hits Nichols again with tremendous force, knocking him against the parapet. Nichols stares over the edge - the street appears far below. 
INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT 
Gerard and his deputies work their way into the ballroom. The deputies move to separate areas. Several doctors point them in the direction Kimble and Nichols fled.

INT. HOTEL SECURITY - NIGHT 
Newman stands in front the security monitors and watches Kimble and Nichols on the roof. 
EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT 
Kimble reaches Nichols and draws to hit him again as the HELICOPTER suddenly ROARS over the rooftop. Its beam hits the two men and a VOICE booms from the helicopter: 
VOICE FROM HELICOPTER (V.O.) Chicago police. Freeze. 
The elevator doors close and the car beneath the skylight begins to descend. 
GERARD 
Pulls up. 
GERARD Kimble! 
Kimble slams Nichols one more time against the glass and the wire holding the glass gives way, sending Kimble and Nichols into... 
INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT 
Kimble and Nichols, locked together, fall down the shaft and crash onto the roof of the descending elevator car. Nichols crashes through the ceiling into the car. Kimble hits and slides across the roof to the edge, stopping himself, just before he falls into the shaft. An elevator car rushes toward him out of the blackness. 
EXT. HOTEL ROOFTOP - NIGHT 
Gerard reaches the elevator housing, looks down into the shaft. 
GERARD'S POV 
Kimble's car disappears into the darkness. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ELEVATOR CAR - NIGHT 
Nichols pulls himself to his feet. Hits the emergency stop and the doors open. He disappears into... 
INT. HILTON LAUNDRY - NIGHT 
... a huge industrial laundry room. Steam rises from the giant machines. 
INT. ELEVATOR CAR/LAUNDRY - NIGHT 
Kimble drops from the ceiling into the car and moves carefully into the laundry. 
... like an industrial jungle. Dimly lit, filled with DEAFENING MACHINERY. Five hundred pound bags of laundry move from a network of ceiling tracks to a pair of heavyduty conveyor belts and two thirty-foot long washers. 
... At the other end of the washers, hydraulic presses stamp out three-foot diameter "cakes" which are moved by conveyor and dollies to automated dryers. 
The NOISE is DEAFENING. 
INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT 
Gerard comes down back stairwell. Followed by Renfro. 
GERARD (to radio) Where did the elevator stop? 
INTERCUT WITH: 
NEWMAN IN SECURITY 
Newman checks the computer board for the elevator position. 
NEWMAN (to radio) Level five. 
INT. LAUNDRY - NIGHT 
Nichols pushes through the hanging laundry bags toward an exit, tries the door. It is secured with a collapsible grating with a padlock. He looks up, keeps moving. 
KIMBLE 
Notices the swinging bags, follows Nichols' trail. He stops to get his bearings, sees shadow at the far end of the room between the two washers. Kimble closes in, moving between the large conveyors. 
ANGLE - SORTING ROOM 
Gerard enters sorting room with Renfro. He sees two sorters standing by a small conveyor as he enters. 
GERARD Get out of here. 
He and Renfro move around the corner where a laundry worker is hooking a 500 lb bag of lines onto the overhead rail. A hydraulic lift, operated by a hanging on/off switch raises the bag on a yellow steel I-beam. The worker takes one look at Gerard and abandons his station. 
Gerard, Biggs and Renfro move to the closed doors of the main room. 
GERARD (to Renfro) We're going in. Give me five minutes. Keep C.P.D. out. 
He draws his Glock, opens the door and enters the main room. 
INT. LAUNDRY - ON KIMBLE - NIGHT 
He moves to end of washers, using the machines as cover. 
He sees the shadow again takes a pole leaning against the dryer as a weapon, turns the corner and is about to belt him when he realizes it's not Nichols, but a laundry worker. 
Kimble moves away from the terrified man, when he hears a voice from the other end of the laundry. 
GERARD (V.O.) (above the din) Kimble! 
Kimble reacts to Gerard's voice, moves away. 
ON NICHOLS 
Moving behind machinery, sees light at far end of the room where Gerard enters. 
ON GERARD 
The door closes automatically behind Gerard and Renfro. 
They enter the noisy main room and separate. Renfro moves up the far side of the room, Gerard up the center. Both move slowly through the maze of bags, carts, automated equipment. 
GERARD ... There is no way out of here. 
The building is locked down. 
CUT TO: 
KIMBLE 
Moves instinctively back into the machinery and carts near the conveyor belts. 
GERARD (O.S.) Kimble... I know about Nichols. I know about Sykes. Kimble stops. 
ON GERARD

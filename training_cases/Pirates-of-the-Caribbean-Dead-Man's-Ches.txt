[view looking straight down at rolling swells, sound of wind and thunder, then a low heartbeat] 
PORT ROYAL 
[teacups on a table in the rain] 
[sheet music on music stands in the rain] 
[bouquet of white orchids, Elizabeth sitting in the rain holding the bouquet] 
[men rowing, men on horseback, to the sound of thunder] 
[EITC logo on flag blowing in the wind] 
[many rowboats are entering the harbor] 
[Elizabeth sitting alone, at a distance] 
[marines running, kick a door in] 
[a mule is seen on the left in the barn where the marines enter] 
[Liz looking over her shoulder] 
[Elizabeth drops her bouquet] 
[Will is in manacles, being escorted by red coats] 
ELIZABETH SWANN Will...! 
[Elizabeth runs to Will] 
ELIZABETH SWANN Why is this happening? 
WILL TURNER I don't know. You look beautiful. 
ELIZABETH SWANN I think it's bad luck for the groom to see the bride before the wedding. 
[marines cross their long axes to bar Governor from entering] 
[Beckett, in white hair and curls, is standing with Mercer] 
LORD CUTLER BECKETT Governor Weatherby Swann, it's been too long. 
LORD CUTLER BECKETT His Lord now... actually. 
LORD CUTLER BECKETT In fact, I *do*. Mister Mercer! The warrant for the arrest of one William Turner. 
LORD CUTLER BECKETT Oh, is it? That's annoying. My mistake. Arrest her. 
ELIZABETH SWANN On what charges? 
WILL TURNER No! 
[Beckett takes another document from Mercer, who is standing with Beckett, craggy face and pony tail] 
LORD CUTLER BECKETT Ah-ha! Here's the one for William Turner. And I have another one for a Mister James Norrington. Is he present? 
ELIZABETH SWANN *What are the charges?* 
LORD CUTLER BECKETT I don't believe that's the answer to the question I asked. 
WILL TURNER Lord Beckett! In the category of questions *not* answered... 
ELIZABETH SWANN We are under the jurisdiction of the King's governor of Port Royal, and you will tell us what we are charged with. 
LORD CUTLER BECKETT For which the punishment, regrettably, is *also* death. Perhaps you remember a certain pirate named Jack Sparrow. 
[Bootstrap looks up from where he's sitting on a barrel, crabs scuttle across his face] 
JACK SPARROW Is this a dream? 
JACK SPARROW I thought not. If it were, there'd be rum. 
[Bootstrap immediately hands Jack a bottle of rum] 
[Jack pries the bottle from Bootstrap's hand with a crackling sound] 
JACK SPARROW I had some help retrieving the Pearl, by the way. 
[Jack tinks the lip of the bottle with his fingers, then blows across the top of the bottle] 
JACK SPARROW Your son. 
[Jack takes a drink from the bottle] 
JACK SPARROW And to what do I owe the pleasure of your carbuncle? 
JACK SPARROW Who? 
JACK SPARROW Ah. So it's you, then.  He shanghaied you into service, eh? 
[a small hermit crab scuttles by Bootstrap, on top of the barrel where Bootstrap sits] 
[Bootstrap grabs the hermit crab, pops it into his mouth, and crunches on it] 
[Jack moves his mouth, jaw, and tongue around in revulsion while watching] 
[Jack hands the bottle back to Bootstrap] 
JACK SPARROW It's funny what a man will do to forestall his final judgment - 
[Jack starts to walk off, but Bootstrap stands up at the same time and intercepts Jack, blocking him] 
JACK SPARROW Technic - 
JACK SPARROW Yes, but the Flying Dutchman already *has* a captain, so there's re - 
JACK SPARROW Any idea when Jones might release said terrible beastie? 
[Jack looks at the palm of his left hand, where a black spot boils into view] 
[Jack looks up, but Bootstrap has disappeared] 
BLACK PEARL: ON DECK 
[Jack runs across a wooden deck that has a shallow covering of water] 
JACK SPARROW On deck all hands! Make fast the bunt gasket! On deck! Scurry! ?Scurry-on/?Marty, I want movement! 
JACK SPARROW *I want movement!* 
GIBBS Lift the skin up! 
JACK SPARROW All on deck! Run! And keep running! Run as if the devil himself and itself is upon us! 
GIBBS Do we have a heading? 
JACK SPARROW Ah! Ooh! Run! Land. 
[Jack rises from where he was ducked behind the base of the mast, sees Gibbs again] 
JACK SPARROW Oh! Euh! 
GIBBS Which port? 
JACK SPARROW Didn't say port. I said land. Any land. 
[the monkey in skeleton form swings down, grabs Jack's hat] 
JACK SPARROW Agh! 
[the monkey snarls at Jack, Jack snarls back at the monkey, in imitation] 
[the monkey throws Jack's hat overboard 
ELIZABETH SWANN I'll wait for you. 
WILL TURNER Keep a weather eye on the horizon. 
[Will walks back up the prison steps] 
Tortuga 
WEATHERED SAILOR *Captain* Jack Sparrow? Owes me four dubloons. Heard he was dead. 
HALF-BLIND FISHERMAN Singapore. That's what I heard. Drunk with a smile on his face. Sure as the tide, Jack Sparrow... will turn up in Singapore. 
[Scarlett is a redhead, Giselle is a blonde, both are standing together, answering Will's questions] 
GISELLE Jack Sparrow! 
SCARLETT I haven't seen 'im in a month. 
GISELLE When you find him, will you give him a message? 
[Giselle slaps Will in the face] 
[a black man who is a shrimper is sitting on a dock, mending his nets] 
[in the background is a bunch of bananas on the dock, and a goat being loaded aboard a ship] 
SHRIMPER Cannot say about Jack Sparrow. But dere's a island, just south of de straits, where I trade spice for... mmm... delicious long pork. Cannot say about Jack. But you find a ship dere. A ship wit' black sails. 
CANNIBAL ISLAND beach 
[Black Pearl seen stranded on a beach, through a spyglass] 
SHRIMPER My brother will take you ashore. 
[the shrimper's brother is rowing Will toward the shore] 
[the rower stops rowing] 
WILL TURNER What's wrong? The beach is right there. 
SHRIMPER'S BROTHER ?: Ne bougeais pas, c'est trop dangereux. 
WILL TURNER What? 
SHRIMPER'S BROTHER ?: Je ne peux, c'est trop dangereux, j'avais le dit. Bon voyage, monsieur. 
[Will jumps off the rowboat, swims ashore, wearing his sword] 
[aerial view, flying over jungle toward beach, showing Will wading ashore] 
[Will walks alongside the Black Pearl, which is tied with ropes to stakes in the sand] 
WILL TURNER Jack! Jack Sparrow! 
WILL TURNER Marty! Cotton! Anybody? 
[Will wanders into the palm jungle bordering the beach] 
[Cotton's parrot flutters up and lands atop a palm stump] 
COTTON'S PARROT Awk! 
WILL TURNER Ah! A familiar face! 
COTTON'S PARROT Rawk! Don't eat me! 
WILL TURNER I'm not gonna eat you. 
COTTON'S PARROT Don't eat me! No! Don't eat me! Akkk! 
[Will finds Gibbs' husk canteen hanging on a plant, trailing a long string] 
WILL TURNER Gibbs. 
[Will follows the string attached to the canteen, over toward a large tree] 
[human eyes open in the background, from a man camouflaged against a nearby tree] 
] Prisoners: Where you goin'...?) 
ELIZABETH SWANN Why don't you tell me what's happening? 
ELIZABETH SWANN No! Will has gone to find Jack! 
ELIZABETH SWANN He's a better man than you give him credit for. 
[a horse and carriage are waiting, the governor opens the door to the carriage for Elizabeth] 
ELIZABETH SWANN A fair trial for Will ends in a hanging. 
[the horse and carriage quickly ride off] 
[the horse and carriage arrive at a dock] 
[Captain Hawkins stands silently on the dock facing out to sea] 
[the captain's body soon falls, revealing Mercer, who was standing behind the body, long knife in hand] 
MERCER Evening, Governor.  Shame, huh? He was carryin' this. It's a letter to the King. It's from *you*. 
[horses and soldiers arrive to cut off the governor from fleeing from the dock] 
[the carriage door is opened, but the carriage is empty, Elizabeth is gone] 
MERCER Where is she? 
[Mercer grabs the governor by the lapels, pushes him up against the side of the carriage] 
PORT ROYAL EITC headquarters 
[darkened room] 
[Beckett walks in from the balcony, carrying a lantern] 
[Beckett walks to a table, opens a wooden box, finds the Letters of Marque missing] 
LORD CUTLER BECKETT No doubt you've discovered that loyalty is no longer the currency of the realm, as your father believes. 
[Elizabeth slips into the dark room from an interior door, hands held behind her] 
ELIZABETH SWANN Then what is? 
LORD CUTLER BECKETT I'm afraid that *currency* is the currency of the realm. 
ELIZABETH SWANN I expect then that we can come to some sort of understanding. I'm here to negotiate. 
LORD CUTLER BECKETT I'm listening. 
[Elizabeth pulls a pistol, points it at Beckett's head] 
LORD CUTLER BECKETT I'm listening *intently*. 
ELIZABETH SWANN These Letters of Marque, they are signed by the King? 
LORD CUTLER BECKETT Yes, and they're not valid until they bear my signature and my seal. 
ELIZABETH SWANN Or else I would not still be here. You sent Will to get you the Compass owned by Jack Sparrow. It will do you no good. 
LORD CUTLER BECKETT Do explain. 
ELIZABETH SWANN I have been to Isla de Muerta, I have seen the treasure myself. There is something you need to know. 
LORD CUTLER BECKETT Ah, I see. *You* think the Compass leads only to the Isla de Muerta, and so you hope to *save* me from an evil fate. But you mustn't worry. I care not for cursed Aztec gold. My desires are not so provincial. There's more than one chest of value in these waters. So perhaps you may wish to enhance your offer. 
[Elizabeth cocks her pistol] 
[Beckett signs the document] 
ELIZABETH SWANN Consider into your calculations that you robbed me of my wedding night. 
LORD CUTLER BECKETT So I did. A marriage interrupted.  Or fate intervenes. You make great efforts to ensure Jack Sparrow's freedom. 
ELIZABETH SWANN These aren't going to Jack. 
LORD CUTLER BECKETT Oh really. To ensure Mister Turner's freedom, then? I'll still want that Compass. Consider that in your calculations. 
GIBBS Worse... as it turns out. See, the Pelegostos believe that Jack is a *god* in human form, and they intend to do him the honor of releasing him from his fleshy prison. 
[Cotton bites Gibbs' fingers to illustrate] 
GIBBS ?Argh! They'll roast him and eat him. 
WILL TURNER Where's the rest of the crew? 
GIBBS These cages we're in... weren't built 'til *after* we got here. 
[Will was gripping the bars made of human bones, but quickly pulls his hand away] 
GIBBS The feast is about to begin. Jack's life will end... when the drums stop. 
WILL TURNER Well, we can't just sit here and wait then, can we? 
CANNIBAL ISLAND throne 
[cannibal drums are pounding] 
JACK SPARROW ?No/?Oup! No no! ?Oy!/?Wait! No no! More wood! Big fire! *Big* fire! I am chief! Want big fire! Come on! 
JACK SPARROW ?Oy!/?Boy! Maboogie snickel-snickel. Tout de suite! Come on! More wood! 
[the cannibal standing next to Jack leaves to put more wood on the fire] 
[the cannibals put large pieces of wood on the fire] 
[the cannibals turn around to find that Jack is gone] 
CANNIBAL ISLAND Jack 
[Jack is running across a foot bridge] 
[Jack runs up to a cliff edge, totters at the edge, looking down] 
[Jack examines a length of bamboo pole he finds lying there] 
[Jack goes into a hut, sees various supplies, the sound of buzzing flies is heard] 
[Jack picks up a rope, starts to exit, halts, looks back inside] 
[Jack goes back in, picks up a can of paprika with the EITC logo on the bottom] 
[Jack walks outside the hut, the entire tribe is waiting silently outside, staring at him] 
JACK SPARROW Oh bugger. 
[Jack drops his coil of rope, sprinkles paprika on his armpits] 
JACK SPARROW Little seasoning. Eh? 
[Jack is now tied up to a bamboo pole and hanging face down over a pile of wood] 
[cannibals are dancing wildly] 
JACK SPARROW Well done. 
CANNIBAL ISLAND cages 
[the men begin swinging the cages with increasingly wide arcs] 
[both cages finally come within reach of the cliff, they grab vines and hang on to the cliff] 
GIBBS Put your legs through, start to climb! Agh! 
WILL TURNER Come on men! It'll take all ?of-us/?the-rest to crew the Black Pearl! 
LEECH Actually, you won't need everyone. 'Bout six would do!  Ohhh... dear. 
[Gibbs nods] 
WILL TURNER Hurry! 
[each cage group begins racing against each other up the cliff] 
Come on! Go! Go! Go! 
WILL TURNER Lift the cage! Hurry! 
GIBBS Come on, men! Lift it like a lady's skirt! 
[the men begin running with their legs protruding from the cage, holding up the cage] 
[Marty's short legs make a running motion but are unable to reach the ground] 
Come on! 
CANNIBAL ISLAND hut 
[Jack is running off with the bamboo pole tied to his back] 
[Jack encounters the cannibal boy, standing silently with a fork and a knife, one in each hand] 
[Jack grabs the knife from the boy, and begins cutting his rope off] 
[two cannibal women appear] 
[Jack charges, but the bamboo pole on his back spears a coconut in a pile near the cliff edge] 
[Jack turns suddenly, which flings the coconut off the end of the pole into a cannibal's face] 
[the cannibal slowly lifts the dripping coconut off his face, scowling at Jack] 
CANNIBAL ISLAND cage 
[the cage rolls over a ledge into a small chasm holding a river] 
[cannibals throw spears and shoot arrows at the men in the water, the men swim underwater] 
GIBBS This way, lads! 
CANNIBAL ISLAND Jack 
[the two cannibal women throw numerous fruits at Jack while the pole is still on his back] 
[several of the fruits become impaled along the pole, making Jack look like he's part of a shish-ka-bob] 
?CANNIBAL BOY Da litozo! Da litozo! 
[Jack pole vaults across the chasm, barely lands on the other edge safely] 
[but the fruit slides down to the end of his pole, putting weight on the end over the chasm] 
[Jack falls into the chasm, screaming] 
[Jack's pole catches between the two walls of a chasm] 
[two native women watch Jack fall into the chasm, with disinterest] 
CANNIBAL WOMAN ?A-geev-nee. Uh-boogie? 
[the two cannibal women walk off, disinterested] 
JACK SPARROW Bugger. 
[Jack's pole slips loose, he falls into the chasm, screaming] 
[As Jack falls through the first rope bridge, the rope comes undone but is still attached to the bamboo pole and to Jack] 
[Jack is hung upside-down in the chasm when the bamboo pole catches] 
[Jack falls through a total of six rope bridges] 
[Jack lands on his back on grass] 
[bamboo pole comes down at him, spears the ground near his head] 
[fruits tumble down afterwards] 
CANNIBAL ISLAND beach 
[only Ragetti and Cotton's parrot are aboard the Black Pearl, Pintel is on the beach below] 
PINTEL ?Pull-loose/?Unloose the mooring lines! The mooring lines! 
WILL TURNER She *is* locked up, in a prison, bound to hang for helping *you*! 
JACK SPARROW There comes a time when one must take responsibility for one's mistakes. 
[Will pulls a sword from the waistband of a pirate who is turned around, points it at Jack] 
WILL TURNER I need that Compass of yours, Jack. I must trade it for her freedom. 
[Jack pushes Will's sword aside] 
JACK SPARROW Mister Gibbs! 
GIBBS Cap'n. 
JACK SPARROW We have a need to travel upriver. 
GIBBS By need, d'you mean a... trifling need, ?uh/?a... fleeting, as in say in a passing fancy? 
JACK SPARROW No, a... resolute and unyielding need. 
WILL TURNER What we need to do is make sail for Port Royal with all haste. 
JACK SPARROW William... I shall trade you the Compass, if you will help me... to find *this*. 
WILL TURNER You want me to find this? 
JACK SPARROW No. *You* want you to find this. Because the finding this finds you incapacitorially finding and/or locating and your discovering the detecting of a way to save your ?dolly/?dotty belle ol'... what's-her-face. Savvy? 
WILL TURNER This... is going to save Elizabeth? 
JACK SPARROW How much do you know about Davy Jones? 
WILL TURNER Not much. 
JACK SPARROW Yeah, it's gonna save Elizabeth. 
Edinburgh Trader 
[a crewman swabbing the deck happens to notice a white dress tucked in a corner, pulls it out] 
[the crewmen are arguing loudly about the newfound dress] 
BELLAMY What's all this? If you both fancy the dress, you'll just have to share, and wear it one after the other. 
BURSAR It's not like that, Sir. This ship is haunted. 
BELLAMY Is it now? 'N' you? 
QUARTERMASTER The... female presence... amongst us, yes... all the men... they can feel it. 
The ghost of a lady, widowed before her marriage, I figure it. Searching for her husband, lost at sea. 
A virgin, too, likely as not. 
And that bodes ill by all accounts. 
BURSAR I say... that we throw the dress overboard, and we hope the spirit finds it. 
QUARTERMASTER No! That - that will just anger the spirit, Sir. What we need to do is find out what the spirit needs, and then just get it back! 
BELLAMY Enough! Enough! You're a pair of superstitious goats and it's got the best of you. Now this appears to be no more as we have a stowaway aboard. A young woman, by the look of it. I want you to search the ship and find 'er. Oh, and uh... she's probably naked. 
[the crew enthusiastically rushes off in search of the stowaway] 
Pantano River 
[aerial view of the mouth of the Pantano River, two longboats are beginning their way up the river] 
[the longboats are in a swampy area with twisted roots] 
WILL TURNER Why is Jack afraid of the open ocean? 
GIBBS Well, if you believe such things, there's a beast does the bidding of Davy Jones. A fearsome creature with giant tentacles that suction your face clean off. And drag an entire ship past the crushing darkness. The Kraken! 
[Marty turns around at mention of the word, Pintel and Ragetti look at each other] 
GIBBS They say the stench of its breath is like - ooh! Imagine: The last thing you know on God's green earth is the roar of the Kraken, and the reeking odor of a thousand rotting corpses. If you believe such things. 
TIA DALMA The payment is fair. 
JACK SPARROW We're looking for this.  And what it goes to. 
TIA DALMA The Compass you bartered from me. It cannot lead you to dis? 
JACK SPARROW Maybe. Why? 
TIA DALMA Ayeee... Jack Sparrow does not know what he wants! Or... do know, but are loathe to claim it as your own. Your key go to a chest, and it is what lay inside the chest you seek, don't it? 
GIBBS What *is* inside? 
PINTEL Gold! Jewels? Unclaimed properties of a valuable nature? 
RAGETTI Nothing... bad, I hope. 
[a jar of eyeballs is hanging next to Ragetti's face as he speaks] 
TIA DALMA You know of... Davy Jones, yes? A man of de sea. A great sailor, until he ran afoul of dat which vex all men. 
WILL TURNER What vexes all men? 
TIA DALMA What, indeed. 
GIBBS The sea? 
PINTEL Sums! 
RAGETTI Dichotomy of good and evil. 
JACK SPARROW A *woman*. 
TIA DALMA A wo-*man*. He fell in love. 
GIBBS No-no-no-no, I heard it was the *sea* he fell in love with. 
TIA DALMA Same story, different versions, and all are true. See, it was a *woman*, as changing, and harsh, and untamable as the sea. Him never stopped loving her. But the pain it cause 'im was too much to live wid. But not enough to cause him to die. 
WILL TURNER What... exactly did he put into the chest? 
TIA DALMA Him heart. 
RAGETTI Literally, or figuratively? 
PINTEL He couldn't li'erally put his heart in a chest!  Could he? 
TIA DALMA It was not wort' feeling what... small fleeting joy life brings, and so... he carved out him heart, lock it away in a chest, and hide de chest from de world. De keys, he keep wid him at all times. 
WILL TURNER You knew this. 
JACK SPARROW I did not. I didn't know where the key was. But now we do. So all that's left is to climb aboard the Flying Dutchman, grab the key, you go back to Port Royal and save your bonnie lass, hey! 
TIA DALMA Let me see your hand. 
[Jack shows his right hand is untouched, but Tia unwraps the bandage on his left hand] 
[the black spot on Jack's left hand is revealed] 
GIBBS Uhhh! The black spot! 
[Gibbs quickly wipes his hands on his chest, spins around once to the left, and spits] 
Black spot! 
Black spot! 
[Pintel and Ragetti copy Gibbs' ritual, in synchrony] 
JACK SPARROW My eyesight's as good as ever, just so you know. 
[pushing aside cloth door beads, Tia goes into a back room, and searches for something] 
TIA DALMA I am justMy little ###, where are you? ### 
[Jack steals a ring off of one of Tia's tables, beside the ring is a silver locket] 
[Tia comes back with an object from the back room] 
WILL TURNER Sailor! 
WOUNDED SAILOR ...bring a... 
WILL TURNER There's no use. You've run aground. 
WOUNDED SAILOR No! Beneath us! Foul breath! 
[behind Will, a crewmember's body falls from a height, splashing into the water] 
[Will goes to investigate] 
WILL TURNER Hey! Hey! 
[Will turns the man's body over to see his face] 
[the man's face is gone, his face is just a puckered piece of skin, which bulges outward] 
[the real Flying Dutchman suddenly rises from the sea, nearby the scuttled ship] 
[the sea creature-like crew emerge from the surfaces of the Flying Dutchman] 
[crewmembers from the Flying Dutchman attack the remaining crew of the scuttled ship] 
GREENBEARD Down on your marrowbones, and pray. 
[Will engages in a swordfight against several invaders] 
[Will dips his sword in oil, causing it to flame, and waves it at the men surrounding him] 
WILL TURNER Get back! Back! 
[Will slices open the stomach of one of the invaders, fish spill out of it onto the deck] 
[Will battles the invading crewmembers, but one of them knocks Will unconscious] 
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha. 
SCUTTLED SHIP after attack 
[the prisoners of the scuttled ship cower in fear, lined up, sitting in a row on deck along the railing] 
[Jack is at the end of the row of five survivors total, on the right-side when facing the survivors] 
[Davy Jones stomps aboard with his peg leg, underwater view of his departing feet] 
[Maccus is on deck, turned so that his back is shown, showing lobster legs on his back] 
MACCUS Five men still alive. The rest have moved on. 
[Jones pauses to clench his left hand, which is a large lobster claw] 
[Jones casually lights a pipe in front of one of the cowering crewmen] 
DAVY JONES Do you fear death?  Do you fear that dark abyss? All your deeds laid bare. All your sins punished.  I can offer you... an escape-uh. 
CHAPLAIN Don't listen to him! 
[Jones walks over to the chaplain, takes the chaplain's head in his claw] 
DAVY JONES Do you not fear death? 
CHAPLAIN I'll take my chances, Sir. 
DAVY JONES To the depths. 
[the chaplain's throat is slit, two crewmembers throw his body overboard] 
Ah, ha-ha-ha...! 
[unidentified crewman] Cold blooded - ! 
DAVY JONES Life is cruel.  Why should the afterlife be any *different*? I offer you a choice. Join my crew, and postpone the judgment. One hundred years before the mast. Will ye serve? 
HELMSMAN I - I will, serve. 
DAVY JONES ?Grand. 
Edinburgh Trader 
[inside a cabin aboard the Edinburgh Trader, Captain Bellamy is throwing documents down on the table] 
BELLAMY It's an outrage. Port tariffs, berthing fees, *wharf* handling, and heaven help us, pilotage. Are we all to work for the East India Trading Company, then? 
QUARTERMASTER I'm afraid, Sir... Tortuga is the only free port left in these waters. 
BELLAMY A *pirate* port is what you mean. Well, I'm sorry. An honest sailor is what I am. I make my living fair, and I sleep well each night, thank you. 
[a white dress floats by the cabin window, outside] 
BURSAR S-S-Sir! 
[they all rush to the window of the cabin and look out] 
[they all see the dress float by the cabin window, on its second pass] 
[one crewman gasps] 
[the men go outside to see the dress that was floating by the window] 
[the dress floats like a ghost, its left arm raised as if pointing] 
BURSAR She wants you to... do something. 
BELLAMY She's tryna give a sign. 
[the dress sweeps over a lantern, knocking it over and part of the deck ignites] 
BELLAMY Over there! Look for a sign! 
[the crew rush to the railing and look out at the sea] 
[Elizabeth, up on the mast overhead, sighs in exasperation] 
QUARTERMASTER Look there! There it is. There's the sign. 
?BURSAR That's seaweed. 
QUARTERMASTER S-Seaweed can be a sign. 
?BURSAR Looks like entrails. 
?That ?would be a bad sign. 
ELIZABETH SWANN What's that over there? 
[Elizabeth is now sitting on a platform on the deck behind the men, pointing at the deck where the lantern fell] 
[the men at the railing turn around and look where Elizabeth is pointing] 
[the fire burning on the desk spells out "Tortuga" in fiery letters] 
Tortuga 
[men are tied up with ropes alongside a well, camera pans past the well] 
[a man is tied up and being dunked in the well, and is spouting water from his mouth] 
[crowded tavern, glass bottles are being shot off of people's heads for entertainment] 
[a duo of musicians is playing a guitar and accordion] 
GIBBS And what makes you think you're worthy to crew the Black Pearl? 
ELDERLY MAN Truth be told, I never sailed a day in me life. I figure I should get out and see the world while I'm still young. 
GIBBS You'll do. Make your mark. Next! 
JILTED MAN My wife ran off with my dog. And I'm drunk for a month. And I don't give a ass rat's if I live or die. 
GIBBS Perfect! Next! 
ONE-ARMED MAN Me have one arm, 'n' a bum leg. 
GIBBS It's the crow's nest for you. 
Heave! 
[the two men throw the carried man off the balcony, then Jack continues on his way] 
[the music stops, Norrington threateningly holds a bottle in his left hand] 
NORRINGTON Come on, men! Who wants some? Form an orderly line, I'll have you all one by one. Come on, who's first? 
[from behind, Elizabeth grabs the bottle from Norrington, smashes it over his head, knocking him out] 
ELIZABETH SWANN I just wanted the pleasure of doing that myself! 
[the crowd cheers, and everyone holds up their mugs in a toast] 
[men throw Norrington into the mud with some pigs, the crowd leaves except for Elizabeth] 
[Elizabeth turns Norrington over, onto his back] 
ELIZABETH SWANN James Norrington.  What has the world done to you? 
[Mercer observes Elizabeth and Norrington from the doorway of the tavern] 
Flying Dutchman 
[Jones plays his pipe organ with his tentacles, steam coming from pipes] 
[the crew are on desk, slaving away, pulling rhythmically on a rope] 
Heave! Heave! Heave! Heave! Heave! Heave! 
BO'SUN Secure the mast tackle, Mister Turner! 
BO'SUN Step ?to-it/?tight! 
[Will goes to grab a rope] 
WILL TURNER Step aside! 
BO'SUN ?Regain-?yourselves!/?Mind-?yourself! 
[Bootstrap sees that the other man at the rope is his son, Bootstrap is stunned] 
[Bootstrap lets go of the rope, Will attempts to grab the sliding rope] 
[the cannon's rope drags Will across the deck] 
[the hoisted cannon crashes to the deck, and the organ music stops] 
BO'SUN Haul that weevil to his feet! 
[the crew haul Will to his feet] 
BO'SUN Five lashes to remind you... to stay on 'em! 
BO'SUN Impeding me in my duties. You'll share the punishment. 
DAVY JONES Will you now? And what would prompt such an act of charity? 
DAVY JONES Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha! What fortuitous circumstance be this! Five lashes be owed. I believe it is. 
[Jones hands the whip to Bootstrap, Jones' tentacle curls around the shaft of it] 
DAVY JONES The cat's out of the bag, Mister Turner. Your issue will feel its sting be it the Bo'sun's hand, by your own. 
DAVY JONES Bo'sun! 
[Bootstrap reluctantly takes the whip] 
[two crewmen tear Will's shirt off, exposing his bare back] 
[Bootstrap whips Will's back five times] 
[Will is tossed into a lower part of the deck, partially filled with water] 
[Will stands up, wearing an intact white shirt] 
BO'SUN You had it easy, boy! Ha ha ha! 
ELIZABETH SWANN Jack. All I want is to find Will. 
JACK SPARROW Are you certain? Is that what you really want most? 
ELIZABETH SWANN 'Course. 
JACK SPARROW Because I would think, you'd want to find a way to *save* Will the most. 
ELIZABETH SWANN And you have a way of doing that? 
JACK SPARROW Well, there is a chest... 
NORRINGTON Oh, dear. 
JACK SPARROW A chest of unknown size and origin. 
[Pintel & Ragetti walk by, together carrying a crate of bottles, and overhearing the conversation] 
PINTEL What contains the still-beating heart o' Davy Jones. 
RAGETTI Unh-unh... unh-unh... unh-unh... 
JACK SPARROW And whoever possesses that chest possesses the leverage to command Jones to do whatever it is he or she wants, including... saving brave William from his grim fate. 
NORRINGTON You don't actually believe him, do you? 
ELIZABETH SWANN How do we find it? 
JACK SPARROW With this. My Compass... is unique. 
NORRINGTON "Unique" here having the meaning of broken. 
JACK SPARROW True enough. This Compass does not point north. 
[Norrington vomits over the side] 
ELIZABETH SWANN Where does it point? 
JACK SPARROW It points to the thing you want most in this world. 
ELIZABETH SWANN Oh Jack! Are you telling the truth? 
JACK SPARROW Every word, love. And what you want most in this world is to find the chest of Davy Jones, is it not? 
ELIZABETH SWANN To save Will? 
JACK SPARROW By finding the chest of Davy Jones. 
[Jack hands the compass to Elizabeth, then draws away quickly so as not to influence the compass] 
[Elizabeth consults the compass, for her the dial clearly points in a specific direction] 
[Jack slowly rises up to peer at the face of the compass] 
JACK SPARROW Mister Gibbs! 
GIBBS Cap'n. 
JACK SPARROW We have our heading. 
GIBBS Finally! Cast off those lines, weigh anchor, and prow that canvas! 
JACK SPARROW Miss Swann. 
GIBBS 
PINTEL Welcome to the crew, former Commodore! Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh... 
[the goat neighs] 
PORT ROYAL EITC headquarters 
[Beckett and Mercer are in a room with the governor, whose hands are in shackles] 
[Mercer is looking through a mounted telescope to outside the window] 
LORD CUTLER BECKETT There's something to knowing the exact shape of the world and one's place in it, don't you agree? 
WILL TURNER Eight fives. 
DAVY JONES Huh huh huh. Welcome to the crew, liar. 
DAVY JONES And be called a liar myself for my trouble? Bootstrap Bill, you're a liar and you will spend an eternity on this ship! Master Turner, feel free to go ashore... the very next time we make port! 
WILL TURNER Fool. Why did you do that? 
WILL TURNER It was never about winning, or losing. 
FLYING DUTCHMAN organ room 
[nighttime on deck of the Flying Dutchman] 
[Will emerges from a hatch on deck] 
[Will sneaks past one one the crew on deck, who is sleeping with a bottle in his hand] 
[Jones is asleep at his organ, snoring] 
[Will sneaks into his room, behind him] 
[Will grabs a nearby quill pen, uses it to lift one of Jones' tentacles] 
[one tentacle accidentally falls on an organ key, almost waking up Jones] 
[the falling tentacle also sets off a locket on top of the organ, that plays a song] 
[Will holds one of the staves in his mouth while lifting the tentacles] 
[Will finally removes the key, replaces it with his drawing of the key] 
FLYING DUTCHMAN deck 
WILL TURNER It's not a fate you had to choose for yourself, either. 
WILL TURNER They'll know you helped me. 
WILL TURNER I take this with a promise. I'll find a way to sever Jones' hold on you. And not rest until this blade pierces his heart. I will not abandon you. I promise. 
[Will sets out alone on a longboat] 
Black Pearl 
[crewmen are scrubbing the deck of the Black Pearl] 
GIBBS Beckett! 
ELIZABETH SWANN Yes, they're signed, Lord Cutler Beckett of the East India Trading Company. 
JACK SPARROW Agh. 
GIBBS Will was working for Beckett, and never said a word. 
JACK SPARROW Agh. 
GIBBS Beckett wants the Compass. Only one reason for that. 
JACK SPARROW Of course. He wants the chest. 
ELIZABETH SWANN Yes, he did say something about a chest. 
GIBBS If the company controls the chest, they controls the sea. 
JACK SPARROW A truly discomforting notion, love. 
GIBBS And bad. Bad for every mother's son what calls himself a pirate. I think there's a bit more speed to be coaxed from these sails. Brace the foreyard! 
JACK SPARROW Might I inquire how as to how you came by these? 
ELIZABETH SWANN Persuasion. 
JACK SPARROW Friendly? 
ELIZABETH SWANN Decidedly not. 
JACK SPARROW Will strikes a deal for these and upholds it with honor. Yet you're the one standing here with the prize. Full pardon, commission as a privateer on behalf of England and the East India Trading Company. As if I could be bought for such a low price. 
RAGETTI It's a mythological creature, I can calls it what I wants. 
ISLA CRUCES beach 
[their longboat arrives at the beach, Jack disembarks and begins to walk off] 
JACK SPARROW Guard the boat, mind the tide... Don't touch my dirt. 
[Elizabeth is walking in some sand dunes near the beach, using the compass] 
ELIZABETH SWANN This doesn't work. And it *certainly* doesn't show you what you want most. 
[Elizabeth sits down on the sand, and sets the compass down on the sand, the needle points to her] 
JACK SPARROW Yes it *does*. You're sitting on it! 
ELIZABETH SWANN Beg your pardon? 
JACK SPARROW Move. 
[they start digging under where Elizabeth was sitting] 
[Pintel and Ragetti are by the boat, clowning around, Ragetti is balancing a shovel on one hand] 
PINTEL "Mind the tide." 
RAGETTI I ?can/?may join the circus! 
PINTEL ?Don't ?mind ?if I shine your shoes, Sir? 
FLYING DUTCHMAN deck 
[Jones is watching Pintel and Ragetti on the beach through a spyglass] 
DAVY JONES They're here. And I cannot step foot on land again for near of a decade. 
MACCUS Then trust us to act in your stead. 
DAVY JONES I'll trust you know what awaits should you *fail*! Down, then! 
[ugly, nondescript crewmember] Down! 
MACCUS Down! 
[view from the deck of the Flying Dutchman as it submerges, some underwater footage] 
[Pintel and Ragetti are astounded to see the ship submerge in the distance, Ragetti's balanced shovel falls] 
[Pintel and Ragetti run off to warn the others] 
ISLA CRUCES beach 
[Norrington is digging in the sand, Jack sits in a lotus position nearby on a sandy slope] 
[while digging, Norrington's shovel hits something hard, they brush off sand to reveal a chest] 
[they remove the chest from the sand] 
[the chest contains a pearl necklace, documents, and a smaller chest, among other things] 
[Elizabeth opens up a letter with a wax seal, and reads it to herself] 
[they all bend near to put their ears to the small chest, and they hear a heartbeat] 
ELIZABETH SWANN It's real! 
NORRINGTON You actually *were* telling the truth. 
JACK SPARROW I do that quite a lot. Yet people are always surprised. 
WILL TURNER With good reason! 
[Will has unexpectedly appeared on the beach, walking up toward them] 
ELIZABETH SWANN Will! You're alright! Thank God! I came to find you! 
[Will and Elizabeth kiss] 
PINTEL Sad. That chest must be worth more 'n a shiny penny. 
RAGETTI Oh! Tsk-tsk-tsk. Terrible temptation. 
PINTEL If we was any kind of *decent*, we'd remove temptation from their path. 
[Pintel and Ragetti giggle and run off to steal the small chest] 
ELIZABETH SWANN Will! *Enough!* 
[Elizabeth is panting from exasperation and exhaustion] 
ELIZABETH SWANN Oh! Oh...! The heat! 
[Elizabeth pretends to faint, which knocks off her hat] 
[Elizabeth watches sideways as the duelists continue fighting, oblivious to her] 
[Elizabeth soon sits up, puts on her hat] 
[Pintel & Ragetti run by in the distance behind her, with the chest] 
[Elizabeth sees Pintel & Ragetti, and goes to chase them] 
[various duel scenes on the beach] 
Bugger! 
[Norrington kicks sand in Will's face] 
NORRINGTON By your leave, Mister Turner. 
[Norrington runs off to chase Jack up the hill] 
[the crew of Flying Dutchman emerge from the shallows] 
[one crewmember holds chain shot as a weapon] 
ISLA CRUCES church 
[Jack and Norrington run through bushes on the beach, then up to a dilapidated stone church on the hill] [P2] 
[Norrington chases Jack up steps inside the building, Jack kicks Norrington back down with his foot] 
[Jack and Norrington have a swordfight on the inside steps] 
[Jack grabs hold of the bell rope, which carries him downward, and carries Will upward, who just arrived] 
WILL TURNER By *your* leave, Mister Norrington. 
[the Flying Dutchman crew on shore are at the large chest and look up to the ringing bell in the building on the hill] 
[while Norrington and Will are dueling on top of the roof, Jack deftly grabs the dangling key away from Norrington's hand] 
[noticing the key gone, Norrington then turns and duels with Jack] 
[soon Norrington knocks Jack's sword from Jack's hand, the sword is flung onto the ground below] 
NORRINGTON Do excuse me while I kill the man who ruined my life. 
WILL TURNER Be my guest. 
JACK SPARROW Let us examine that claim for a moment, former Commodore, shall we? Who was it, who at the very moment you had a notorious pirate safely behind bars, saw fit to *free* said pirate, and take your dearly beloved all to hisself, hey? So who's fault is it, *really*, that you've ended up a rum-pot deckhand what takes orders from pirates? 
NORRINGTON Enough! 
[Jack somersaults off the roof to escape, Norrington turns to Will] 
NORRINGTON Unfortunately, Mister Turner... He's *right*! 
[Norrington and Will resume their part of the rooftop duel] 
JACK SPARROW Still rooting for you, mate! 
[Jack picks up his sword from the ground, and puts the key around his neck] 
[Jack walks through a graveyard, falls into an open grave] 
[Hadrus' headless body walks into a coconut palm] 
HADRUS No... That's a tree. 
JACK SPARROW Oh, shut it. 
[Jack unlocks the small chest with the key, square security bolts suddenly protrude when opened] 
[the heart is inside, beating] 
[crewmen of the Flying Dutchman approach, Jack tucks the heart into his vest] 
[Elizabeth uses two swords together, one in each hand, to stab backwards and kill two attacking crewmen] 
ISLA CRUCES beach 
[Jack is the first to arrive back at the longboat on the beach] 
JACK SPARROW Jar of dirt! 
[Jack opens his jar of dirt, dumps out some dirt, puts the heart in the jar, scoops handfuls of dirt back into the jar] 
[a Flying Dutchman crewmember arrives at the boat, Jack fights him using an oar] 
[the swordfight is carried to the beach as the Black Pearl crew attempts to escape by longboat] 
[Norrington arrives at the longboat, while others are fighting he takes the heart from the jar, puts it under his vest] 
[the rolling waterwheel reaches the beach, rolls out into the shallows, falls on its side] 
[Norrington and Will walk away from it, wobbling from dizziness] 
WILL TURNER Right! 
[Pintel & Ragetti attempt to escape by longboat, but Will blocks their progress] 
[Pintel & Ragetti reach for their swords, to find their swords gone] 
[Pintel & Ragetti grab a fishnet and oar as weapons against Will] 
PINTEL Come on, Turner! 
[Jack fights with Koleniko, using an oar, subdues him] 
[Will sees the key in the chest, Jack notices Will looking at the key and chest] 
[Jack hits Will on the head with the our, which knocks him out] 
JACK SPARROW Leave him lie! Unless you plan on using him to hit something with. 
ELIZABETH SWANN We're not getting out of this. 
NORRINGTON Not with the chest. Into the boat. 
[Norrington takes the chest] 
ELIZABETH SWANN You're mad. 
NORRINGTON Don't wait for me. 
JACK SPARROW Uh, I say we respect his final wish. 
PINTEL Aye! 
[the remaining Black Pearl crew escape by longboat] 
[Hadrus is holding his conch shell head under one arm, the head speaks to Norrington] 
HADRUS Your bravery is wasted. I shall pry the chest away from your cold... dead... hands. 
[Norrington pauses, looks around] 
NORRINGTON Here you go! 
HADRUS Oo! 
[Norrington flees, Hadrus drops his head onto the ground when catching the chest] 
[ball whistles through the air, strikes the gunpowder, which explodes] 
[the Kraken releases its hold, burned tentacles withdraw into the ocean, groaning sound] 
MARTY Did we kill it? 
GIBBS No. We just made it angry. We're not out of this yet. Captain! Orders! 
JACK SPARROW Abandon ship. Into the longboat. 
GIBBS Jack! The Pearl! 
JACK SPARROW She's only a ship, mate. 
ELIZABETH SWANN He's right, we have to head for land. 
PINTEL 'S a lot o' open wa'er. 
RAGETTI That's a lot o' wa'er. 
WILL TURNER We have to try. We can get away as it takes down the Pearl. 
GIBBS Abandon ship. Abandon ship or abandon hope. 
[the crew get ready to leave the Pearl, loading supplies and guns] 
[Elizabeth approaches Jack] 
ELIZABETH SWANN Thank you, Jack. 
JACK SPARROW We're not free yet, love. 
ELIZABETH SWANN You came back. I always knew you were a good man. 
[Elizabeth passionately kisses Jack] 
[Will sees the kiss from the longboat, falters] 
GIBBS Prepare to cast off! There's no time to lose! Come on, Will, step to! 
[the kiss is inturrupted by the sound of shackles, Elizabeth has chained Jack to the main mast] 
ELIZABETH SWANN It's after you, not the ship. It's not us. This is the only way, don't you see? I'm not sorry. 
[Elizabeth leans in as if to kiss him again.] 
JACK SPARROW Pirate. 
[Elizabeth leaves Jack and climbs down into the long boat] 
WILL TURNER Where's Jack? 
ELIZABETH SWANN He elected to stay behind to give us a chance. 
[the crew look uncertain] 
ELIZABETH SWANN Go! 
[the longboat casts off] 
[Jack struggles with his manacles] 
JACK SPARROW Bugger, bugger, bugger, bugger, bugger, bugger...! 
[a coconut and cannonball roll by, on the tilted deck] 
[Jack spots a fallen lantern, picks it up with the tip of his sword] 
[Jack breaks the lantern against the mast, pours oil over his wrists] 
[Jack struggles with slipping his hand out] 
JACK SPARROW Come on... Come on... 
[Jack finally manages to slip his hands out] 
[the Kraken rises up behind him]

FADE IN: 
1 INT. HARVEY'S KITCHEN - RECORDED WILL - NIGHT - 1978 
Close on a finger pressing the "record" button of a circa 1970's tape recorder. 
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) This is Harvey Milk speaking on Friday November 18th. This is to be played only in the event of my death by assassination... REVEAL: HARVEY MILK, 48, sitting at his kitchen table in a cluttered San Francisco apartment. 
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) During one of the early campaigns, I started opening my speeches with the same line and it sort of became my signature... 
2 EXT. CITY HALL - NIGHT 
In street clothes, trying to corral an angry mob on City Hall's steps, Harvey lifts a bullhorn. 
HARVEY MILK Hello, I'm Harvey Milk, and I'm here to recruit you. 
3 INT. HARVEY'S KITCHEN - RECORDED WILL - NIGHT 
Harvey at his kitchen table making his recording... 
HARVEY MILK If I was speaking to a slightly hostile or mostly straight audience, I'd try to break the tension with a joke... 
4 INT. UNION HALL - NIGHT 
Harvey is in a plain, ill fitting brown suit making a CAMPAIGN SPEECH to a crowd of stone faced UNION BOYS. 
HARVEY MILK I know, I know, I'm not what you were expecting, but I left my high heels at home. Harvey gets a LAUGH from the AUDIENCE. 
5 INT. HARVEY'S KITCHEN - RECORDED WILL - NIGHT 
RETURN TO: Harvey speaking into his tape recorder. 
HARVEY MILK I fully realize that a person who stands for what I stand for - an activist, a gay activist - becomes the target or potential target for a person who is insecure, terrified, afraid or very disturbed themselves... 
6 INT. CITY HALL OFFICES - MONTAGE - DAY 
POLICE OFFICERS AND PRESS RACE THROUGH THE HALLS of City Hall, their walkie-talkies squawking. Something terrible has happened. It's chaos. A STRETCHER IS WHEELED OUT OF AN OFFICE. On it, a FILLED BODY BAG with a WHITE SHEET draped over it. The press rush to get a shot. The police officers quickly load the body onto the elevator and disappear from sight. 
9 EXT. S.F. CITY HALL / FRONT STEPS - DAY 
A shell shocked DIANNE FEINSTEIN, 45, wades into a throng of REPORTERS. Those surrounding her try to quiet the crowd. 
DIANNE FEINSTEIN As President of the Board of Supervisors, it's my duty to make this announcement. Both Mayor Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk have been shot... and killed. GASPS from the REPORTERS. Dianne struggles to be heard. 
DIANNE FEINSTEIN (CONT'D) Police are looking for a suspect... Supervisor Dan White. 
10 INT. ST. MARY'S CATHEDRAL - DAY 
The very picture of loveliness, MARY-ANN WHITE, 28, finds her husband DAN WHITE, 31, sitting in the pews praying. He's a handsome, devout, all-American man in a three-piece suit. She sits by him. A weight hangs. He can't make eye contact. 
DAN WHITE Something has happened. 
She puts her arm around him, feels a gun at his side. She holds him, firmly gripping the revolver in his holster, to conceal, to keep him from using it, potentially on himself. 
SCOTT SMITH Are you on uppers or what? 
HARVEY MILK No. This is just... plain old me. 
SCOTT SMITH You're afraid of the cops? 
HARVEY MILK I'm just discreet. I know a lot of people here. If they found out, I could lose my job. 
SCOTT SMITH (meaning a closet case) Oh. You're one of "those." (examines Harvey's eyes) I think you need a change of scenery. New friends. 
HARVEY MILK I need a change. 
SCOTT SMITH (looks at the clock) You're forty now. 
HARVEY MILK (just the truth) Forty years old and I haven't done a thing I'm proud of. 
SCOTT SMITH (re: the desert tray) You keep eating like this and you'll be a fat ass by fifty. 
HARVEY MILK (laughs it off) No. Don't you worry. I won't make it to fifty. Scott distracts him, playful, like a newlywed at a wedding, he rubs a slice of pie in Harvey's face. Harvey reacts. Wipes the pie from his eye, and tackles his young, frisky new lover. They kiss. The mess getting everywhere. Harvey brushes it out of Scott's hair. 
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) (an idea, half-jokingly, 
HALF-SERIOUSLY) Why don't we run away together? 
SCOTT SMITH Where to? 
16 INT. FLASH FORWARD - HARVEY'S KITCHEN - RECORDED WILL - NIGHT 
RETURN TO: Harvey speaks to the tape recorder. (Throughout the film, these scenes should feel intimate, as if Harvey is telling us things no one else knows.) 
HARVEY MILK In those days, San Francisco was the place where everyone wanted to go... To drop out... To fall in love... 
16A INT. DODGE CHARGER - MONTAGE - (1972) 
8MM HOME MOVIE MONTAGE of Harvey and Scott DRESSED FULL-OUT LIKE HIPPIES, long hair, beard, beads, sunglasses, driving 
through the redwoods, over the Golden Gate Bridge, and into San Francisco. 
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) But by 1972, The Haight was boarded up. Crime-filled. Drug-filled. The new place for us refugees was this run down Irish Catholic neighborhood in Eureka Valley. Six blocks square... The Castro. 
17 EXT. CASTRO STREET - DAY 
Harvey lifts a Nikon camera and starts SNAPPING PHOTOS of Castro Street. 
WE SEE WHAT HARVEY SEES THROUGH THE LENS: A HARDWARE STORE, a LIQUOR STORE, empty buildings, boarded windows... Harvey points the camera toward The MARQUEE of the Castro Theater, big letters spelling out... "C A S T R O..." Harvey points his camera across the street at the gray- haired, OWNER of a liquor store. Harvey snaps PHOTOS of his face, an expression of distrust. Harvey SNAPS a SIGN in the liquor shop window that reads: 
"EUREKA VALLEY MERCHANTS SOCIETY." Harvey's CAMERA focuses on TWO CUTE, YOUNG, HIPPIE BOYS WALKING PAST, one puts his arm over the other. To Harvey's eyes it's a very new site. It's overt. Thrilling. Harvey snaps a photo of an empty storefront with a FOR RENT SIGN hanging out front. 
19 INT. HARVEY'S AND SCOTT'S EMPTY APARTMENT - DAY 
The place is FILLED with OPERA MUSIC from a record player. Harvey is loading a roll of film into his camera. Scott is getting high, lying in the sun that pours through the large, empty windows. 
SCOTT SMITH I cashed my last unemployment check yesterday... 
HARVEY MILK Well, I hope you did something useful with it. 
SCOTT SMITH I bought an ounce of pot. I was just wondering if you had any 
(MORE) 
HARVEY MILK We should have at least one block in one city right? Start there and take over the neighborhood. (a smile) Okay, you can come in now! Scott heads toward the kitchen. The table is LAID OUT with a home-cooked meal, CANDLES and a huge bouquet of FLOWERS. 
SCOTT SMITH Wow. This is-- 
Harvey SMASHES A CREAM PIE into Scott's face. Payback. 
HARVEY MILK Happy birthday! Scott chases Harvey around the apartment, trying to smear some of the CREAM PIE onto him. 
22 EXT. THE CASTRO - DAY 
The street is shut down for the first ever Castro Street Fair. The crowd is mostly gay, the majority congregate outside Toad Hall bar. ANGLE ON: SOME OF THE OLD-SCHOOL, IRISH LOCALS milling about, eyeing the scene skeptically. Harvey MOVES THROUGH THE CROWD with Scott, shaking hands. 
MAN ON THE STREET Thanks for the party, Mr. Milk! 
HARVEY MILK Thanks for joining the Castro Village Association! Harvey arrives at A LONG LINE OF GAY MEN winding out of the Irish liquor store (from earlier). He squeezes past them, into the store, leaving Scott outside. 
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) Excuse me gentleman... ladies. (finding the shop owner) Hello! Mr. McConnelly! McConnelly, at the register, is overwhelmed with all the new business. 
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) I just wanted to stop in and see how business was doing. 
MCCONNELLY Fine. 
HARVEY MILK So you don't mind all these homosexuals in here, do you? McConnelly grins, uncomfortable. The line of gay men is curious about the hubbub. Point made, Harvey does a 180. 
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) No. No. Just a joke. Mr. McConnelly here loves our kind. Spend away! (to McConnelly) Tell your wife Hello for me. Harvey spots Scott in the crowd and PULLS HIM TOWARD HIM, KISSING HIM ON THE MOUTH. It's quite the show. They step back out onto the street where an Irish band is now playing. Gay men watch. Some clap. Harvey grabs Scott and spins him through a sharp waltz. OFF the pair at home in their new neighborhood. 
23 INT. FLASH FORWARD - HARVEY'S KITCHEN - RECORDED WILL - NIGHT 
HARVEY MILK And people started hanging around our store. Not customers. Activists, kids, folks who needed a home away from home... 
26 EXT. CASTRO CAMERA - INTERCUT 
A NEW sign goes in the window: "We are VERY open." 
27 INT. CASTRO CAMERA SHOP - DAY 
A FEW YOUNG MEN are hanging out in the shop, the beginnings of Harvey's entourage. Harvey moves among them, sharing a clipped Sunday cartoon, lecturing them on politics or the arts, and checking out the cute ones. 
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) There was Danny Niccoletta, a cute art student who I'd picked up at Toad Hall. Turns out he was also good at running the Camera Shop... something Scott and I found we had surprising little interest in... ON DANNY NICCOLETTA, young, waif-like, somewhat helpless. 
DANNY NICCOLETTA Opera is passe, Harvey. It's about street theater, now. 
HARVEY MILK What you're not getting is the spectacle of it, the bigger than life emotions... Danny jumps up and IMITATES the LARGER THAN LIFE GESTURES of an opera diva, making Harvey laugh. 
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D) Jim Rivaldo. A great mind. A great wit. A Harvard graduate, which nobody cared about, in those days, in the Castro... including himself. JIM RIVALDO flops down into the vintage dental chair that sits in front of Harvey's desk. He seems to be looking for something to occupy his keen mind. A sharply dressed young man, 20s, DICK PABICH, walks up to peek over his shoulder. 
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D) And somewhere along the line Jim picked up a protege, a cute political kid from Wisconsin... Dick Pabich... And of course there was Dennis Peron, who ran a very popular business with the new kids... DENNIS PERON hands Scott a FREE JOINT. 
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D) And on occasion we actually had a real customer. But only occasionally. ACROSS THE ROOM, Scott is waiting on a CUSTOMER, he's out of place: straight, gruff, a union man, ALLAN BAIRD, 40s. 
SCOTT SMITH Harvey... This guy wants to talk to you. 
HARVEY MILK (approaches Allan) Welcome. What can we do for you? 
ALLAN BAIRD Hi, I'm Allan Baird. Teamsters representative, and Director of the Coors beer boycott in California. 
HARVEY MILK Everyone, this is Allan Baird. He's a very big deal, so behave yourselves. 
ALLAN BAIRD I was told you were like the Mayor of the Castro, said you organized the CVA, you might know some people in the bars. 
HARVEY MILK ...if we had someone in the government who saw things the way we see them, the way the black community has black leaders who look out for their interests-- 
SCOTT SMITH You're gonna run for Supervisor, is that the idea? 
HARVEY MILK 
(HALF-JOKING) I could go right for mayor, but I think I should work my way up to it... You'll be my campaign manager. 
SCOTT SMITH 
(SARCASTIC) Because I have so much experience in politics. 
HARVEY MILK Politics is theater. It doesn't matter if you win. You make a statement. You say, "I'm here, pay attention to me." 
SCOTT SMITH Harvey, you do that every time you cross the street. 
HARVEY MILK Coors looks like it might cave. The union boys will owe me. Imagine if we get their vote... It'll be fun! 
SCOTT SMITH Fun? Harvey starts kissing him all over. 
HARVEY MILK We'll make it a spectacle. 
31 EXT. CASTRO STREET - DAY 
Harvey walks down to Market St. with a box. He waves, shakes, flirts with everyone. His warmest hello is from a gruff UNION MAN. Behind Harvey, Scott pushes a loaded shopping cart. Harvey sets his box down right beside a SFPD OFFICER. It reads, âSoap Box.â Harvey steps onto it. A crowd forms. 
HARVEY MILK A week ago, Police officers came into our area with covered up badges and sent fourteen of our people to the hospitals, and to jail. The charges, "Blocking a Sidewalk." Like a round girl at a boxing match, Scott parades around a blown up PHOTO from his shopping cart: TWO SF COPS DRAGGING 
GAY MEN INTO A PADDY WAGON. 
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) --Let us have our tax money go for our protection and not our persecution. Worry about gun control and not marijuana control. 
(MORE) 
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) School supplies, seniors, not what books I read-- Scott displays an old "Muscle Boys" magazine. Harvey does a well timed take. A few hoots from the eclectic crowd. 
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) My fellow degenerates, I would like to announce my candidacy for San Francisco City Supervisor! Scott unfurls three hand made "MILK FOR CITY SUPERVISOR" banners that lap over the sides of the shopping cart. 
32 EXT. VARIOUS STREETS IN SF - HANDING OUT FLYERS MONTAGE 
WE SEE SCOTT, DANNY, JIM handing out FLYERS to a variety of SF CITIZENS: gay boys, older people, Chinese people, scared straight people, heckling high school boys. Harvey EAGERLY APPROACHES anyone and everyone, shaking hands if they'll let him, reaching out to old people, straight people, gay people, even buttoned down BUSINESSMEN who cross the street to try to get away from him. 
33 EXT. THE CASTRO/18TH AND CASTRO - DAY 
Harvey hands out campaign literature to a PASSERSBY. 
HARVEY MILK Public dental care for retired people... Legalize pot, vote Milk. Harvey is distracted. A young, long haired CLEVE JONES passes. At 18, he looks 15. Harvey tries for his attention: 
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) Hey, I like the way your pants fit... Where are you from, kid? 
CLEVE JONES 
(LAUGHS) Sorry old man, not interested. 
HARVEY MILK Where's home? 
CLEVE JONES Phoenix. 
HARVEY MILK I'm Harvey Milk. I'm running for Supervisor. What's your name? 
SCOTT SMITH I'm beat, Harvey. I passed out flyers for seven hours straight. 
HARVEY MILK In the bathhouse? 
SCOTT SMITH (giving it right back) People in bathhouses vote. I'm tired. I'm taking a nap. Scott heads up the stairs to their apartment. A CUSTOMER comes in. Danny quickly gathers the REVEALING PHOTOS and puts them back in the envelope. 
HARVEY MILK Just checking the exposure. That a new boyfriend? He's very cute. 
CUSTOMER (taking the photos, embarrassed) Um... Thanks, Harvey. 
HARVEY MILK (to Jim) So who are these so-called "gay leaders?" And who appointed them? And what are you suggesting, Jim, that I'm supposed to go and solicit their endorsement? PAST HARVEY WE SEE A GRANDMOTHERLY VOLUNTEER, THELMA, opening the mail, casually reading a letter, then rising and approaching Harvey. 
THELMA 
HARVEY-- 
HARVEY MILK We're down here, on the streets, trying to help people, so where they hell are they? 
DICK PABICH David Goodstein is the publisher of The Advocate and he has a house-- 
JIM RIVALDO A mansion-- 
DICK PABICH --in Atherton. 
THELMA (clearly shaken) Harvey, you should read this. CLOSE ON THE LETTER as it goes from Thelma to Harvey. 
37 INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT / KITCHEN - LATER 
Scott reads the LETTER. Harvey sits VERY STILL. 
SCOTT SMITH "Harvey Milk will have a dream journey and nightmare to hell, a night of horror. You will be stabbed and have your genitals, cock, balls, prick cut off." 
(MORE) 
SCOTT SMITH (CONT'D) 
(BEAT) I'm calling the police. 
HARVEY MILK They probably wrote it. (off Scott's anxiety) Hey, If somebody tries to kill me, I'll get the sympathy vote, right? Could be just the push we need. 
SCOTT SMITH You think this is funny? Look at it. Reluctantly, Harvey takes the letter from Scott. 
HARVEY MILK It's a complete joke. No rhythm. No humor. It's insulting. CLOSE ON THE LETTER: Someone has drawn a STICK FIGURE of Harvey being tortured - bullets, knives, fire, etc. Harvey makes a DECISION: He sticks the DRAWING to the refrigerator, the first thing he'll see in the morning. 
SCOTT SMITH Don't do that. 
HARVEY MILK If you put it away, hide it in a drawer, it'll just get bigger and scarier. Now it's there. We'll see it every day. It can't get us. 
SCOTT SMITH All this energy... to make yourself a target. And what for? Something we have no chance to win. Harvey wraps his arms around him. 
HARVEY MILK I keep telling you, it's not just about winning. 
38 EXT. DAVID GOODSTEIN'S MANSION - DAY 
Harvey, in his work boots and jeans, watches as a LARGE GATE SLIDES OPEN allowing his entry. Scott, even scruffier looking than Harvey, stands next to him. 
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) The "top gays" in San Francisco were David Goodstein and his lawyer sidekick Rick Stokes. David was a 
(MORE) 
SCOTT SMITH No. Not cute. The shoes are hideous and I hate your hair. You're not fooling anybody. 
HARVEY MILK I'm not gonna let the Pacific Heights biddies write me off again because of a ponytail. I like it. Scott is horrified. Harvey pulls a pair of movie ticket stubs from its inner pocket. 
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) Cabaret? For two? Lily, is this from one of my kind? 
LILY No, no. You won't run into the owner. He died in that suit. 
SCOTT SMITH This isn't sexy, Harvey. Harvey grabs Scott, kisses him. Then playful: 
HARVEY MILK Too bad. No more pot, no more bath houses for me and little poo. 
44 INT/EXT. CASTRO CAMERA - DAY 
MONTAGE: More ACTIVITY inside and outside the shop. More VOLUNTEERS. The printing press burns through flyers. 
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) We ran and we lost the Supervisors race a second time in '75, but with 
(MORE) 
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D) more votes than ever. So in 1976, against everyone's advice, I really pissed off the Democratic political power houses, because I ran against "their boy"-- 
A SIGN GOES IN THE SHOP WINDOW "HARVEY MILK VS. THE MACHINE." 
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D) --Art Agnos, a part of their "Political Machine." And this time we weren't running for City Supervisor. This time it was bigger, California State Assembly. 
50 INT. HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW / CANDIDATE DEBATE - NIGHT 
It's a firestorm of words as Harvey debates Art Agnos. 
HARVEY MILK It's a racket. It's 1976 and you still have to be straight, white, Catholic and male to get into the San Francisco police force. It's Racist. Homophobic. 
ART AGNOS How many people do you consider enemies, Harvey? I've counted five already. Art smiles. Chuckles flutter through the audience. 
HARVEY MILK You're right, Art. And many are your closest friends. You see, I don't think State Assembly seats should be awarded on the basis of service to the Democrat Machine. Machines operate on oil and grease. They're dirty, dehumanizing, and too often unresponsive to any needs but those of the operator. 
ART AGNOS Mr. Milk, I've worked for years as a social worker in this city. I know Sacramento. I know how to get done what we all need done there. 
HARVEY MILK Tell me Mr. Agnos... right here in the Castro, Robert Hillsbourough was murdered for walking home with his long time partner. Stabbed, 
(MORE) 
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) fifteen times. The last words he heard were "Faggot, Faggot, Faggot..." And you say you're outraged, but why won't your liberal establishment return our calls? Why won't they bring these murderers to justice? 
51 EXT. HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW - LATER 
Art Agnos puts his arm around Harvey as they walk out. 
ART AGNOS You know Harv', your whole rap's a real downer. 
HARVEY MILK My God, you're handsome up close. I can't tell you how much I'm looking forward to licking you... in the polls. 
ART AGNOS 
(LAUGHS) You talk a lot about what you're against. What are you for? In this town, you gotta give em' a reason for optimism or you're cooked. Art gets into his car and goes. Harvey has no car. He stops and PONDERS ART'S WORDS... They stick with him. 
51A INT. HARVEY'S AND SCOTT'S APARTMENT - EVENING 
Scott tries to make a simple meal of pasta, struggling to operate in the kitchen that is filled with Harvey's POLITICAL ENTOURAGE and VOLUNTEERS. He finds Harvey, Jim, and Dick having an impromptu strategy meeting in the adjoining bedroom. 
HARVEY MILK Give me permission to march them. 
POLICEMAN Where? 
HARVEY MILK Anywhere. 
60 EXT. CASTRO AND MARKET STREET - MOMENTS LATER 
Surrounded by the massive crowd, HARVEY CLIMBS THE LARGE BOX that covers the subway construction at Market and Castro. It's a stage of sorts. Harvey lifts his bullhorn to his lips. 
HARVEY MILK I know you are angry. I am angry. Follow me through the streets of San Francisco to share our anger! Harvey jumps down and begins walking, not sure if the mob will follow. Finally, they do. Cleve catches up. 
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) Are they following in back? 
CLEVE JONES Yes. Where are we going? 
HARVEY MILK I don't know. (off Cleve's concern) We have to keep them moving. Exhaust them. March them till they drop. We can't have a riot tonight. Harvey LIFTS THE BULLHORN. He starts a marching chant. The crowd starts following along. JUMP TO: Gays glare at cops. Cops beat their nightsticks against their chests and power poles. Anger burns as Harvey marches the mob toward City Hall. Dick and Jim catch up. 
DICK PABICH They're still too hot in back. They'll burn the joint down. 
HARVEY MILK Help me turn them up Van Ness. We'll go all the way to Broadway. 
Dick heads back to try and wrangle the crowd. Harvey continues marching. 
61 EXT. CITY HALL - LATER THAT NIGHT 
Harvey arrives, the crowd still hot. Cops beat their nightsticks against their shields. Some jab protesters, trying to incite a fight. Anger burns. Harvey climbs the steps, his stage. He lifts his bullhorn. 
HARVEY MILK My name is Harvey Milk... And I want to recruit you. The CROWD ROARS APPROVAL. 
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) I am here tonight to say, we will no longer sit quietly in our closets. We must fight. Not just in the Castro, or San Francisco, but everywhere the Anitas go. Anita Bryant did not win tonight. Anita Bryant has brought us together... She is going to create a national gay force! (The crowd ROARS) And the young people in Richmond, Minnesota, or Jackson, Mississippi, or Woodmere, New York... Who are coming out and hearing Anita Bryant on television telling them that they're wrong, they're sick, that there is no place for them in this great country, in this world... They're looking to us for something tonight... (his big moment, realizing his true mission) And I say, we have to give them hope! The CROWD goes WILD. HARVEY'S SPEECH CROSSES THE CUT TO... 
63 INT. COMMUNITY CENTER - NIGHT 
Harvey speaks to the "PARENT-TEACHERS UNITED FOR BETTER SCHOOLS" group. 
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) --Hope for a better world... Hope for a better tomorrow... Hope for a 
(MORE) 
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D) better place to come to if the pressures at home are too great... 
64 INT. UNION HALL - NIGHT 
Harvey speaks to a hall filled with TEAMSTERS. 
HARVEY MILK Hope for the worker who awakens from the American dream to find that all the jobs have left the country... We gotta give em' HOPE! PAN FACES OF TEAMSTERS - Several MINORITY FACES. CLOSE ON 
ALLAN BAIRD (UNION LEADER OF THE COORS BEER BOYCOTT). HE 
STARTS TO APPLAUD. OTHERS JOIN IN. 
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D) (pre-lap, an intimate tone) When San Francisco changed the voting rules-- 
65 INT. FLASH FORWARD - HARVEY'S KITCHEN - RECORDED WILL - NIGHT 
Harvey is still speaking into the tape recorder... 
HARVEY MILK --they allowed people to elect Supervisors directly from their own neighborhoods. A black neighborhood could elect an African- American. Chinatown could elect a Chinese Supervisor... And the Castro could choose me or Rick Stokes. But decent art begs for balance, right? So little district 8, two miles south of The Castro-- 
DICK PABICH You replaced Scott with a lesbian? 
HARVEY MILK Anne worked on a recycling campaign up North. She's very organized. 
JIM RIVALDO How do you know she's not a plant from Rick Stokes' campaign? 
ANNE KRONENBERG Are you guys always this paranoid? 
MICHAEL WONG Yes. They take after Harvey. 
HARVEY MILK Shouldn't you be doing someone's laundry? 
MICHAEL WONG Right after you redecorate my house. 
ANNE KRONENBERG (pointed at Jim Rivaldo) Sir, my girlfriends say you guys don't like women. Just asking, is there a place for us in all this, or are you scared of girls? 
HARVEY MILK Gentleman, we already have a tinker bell, a lotus-blossom, Jim and Dick in your three-piece suits. We need someone to manage things. A woman this time. She's the right price, and she has bigger balls than any of you. 
ANNE KRONENBERG Just give me whatever's left over in the register at the end of the day. So should I call the Chronicle about getting US an endorsement? No? OFF the group of misfits, considering the addition. 
69B INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE A LECTURE HALL - NIGHT 
PAN OFF: a large "RICK STOKES, SUPERVISOR DISTRICT 5" poster to reveal Anne Kronenberg outside the hall handing "MILK" signs to a long line of gathering women and lesbians who are filing in. Flanked by a PEEVED AID, Rick Stokes rushes out of the lecture hall and confronts Anne. 
RICK STOKES Young lady, you must be confused. This is my night, not Mr. Milk's. 
ANNE KRONENBERG (as pleasant as can be) No, sir. I'm Harvey's new campaign manager. Anne Kronenberg. 
RICK STOKES Then you should know this race is for District 5, the Castro, not for all of your lesbian... compadres-- A tough lesbian kisses Anne and stares Rick down as she heads in. Rick looks uncomfortable around all these women. 
ANNE KRONENBERG I'm sorry. Are we distracting you, Mr. Stokes? I'd hate to screw you up on your big night. Dick runs up looking for more fliers. Taking Rick even more off his game, Dick is flirtatious. 
DICK PABICH Hi Rick, handsome suit. Annie, do you have any more hand cards? 
RICK STOKES These people are not from this area. They need to leave. Now. 
DICK PABICH Not true. Guess where we found them all, Rick? A slew of them. Way up on Valencia Street. Living right there in our district. And you see, as it turns out, Annie here is very, very popular with the ladies. Dick puts his arm around Anne. Rick is stupefied. 
70 EXT. SF STREET - DAY 
Dozens of supporters hold "MILK for Supervisor" signs in a long line along Market St. waving to commuters. Anne walks the long line, handing out new signs to arriving volunteers. Harvey is handing out FLYERS. He is exhausted, his throat is RAW. The campaign is nearly over. A WEIRD MOMENT: A BOY walks up to Harvey and hands him a flier. ALL SOUND GOES DEAD ON THE SOUNDTRACK as HARVEY'S EYES lock into the BOY'S EYES. Harvey reads the FLIER: âUnite and Fight for Dan White.â Harvey looks back to pat the BOY'S head, but he's gone. He looks to the sidewalk for the kid... a parent... nothing... 
71 INT. CASTRO CAMERA - NIGHT 
Harvey is still looking at the flier. Anne is leaving with a stack of SF Chronicles. Cleve comes in, pulls one off her stack, and looks for "the article." 
HARVEY MILK They've accused me of many things, but never as blatant a lie as this. 
ANNE KRONENBERG First ever newspaper endorsement. 
CLEVE JONES (reading the article) They endorsed you for being a good businessman? Has Scott read this? He'll piss himself. 
HARVEY MILK Yeah? Go show him. (Cleve starts to go) 
(MORE) 
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) Cleve, maybe you should go find a boy to celebrate with. Just in case. 
CLEVE JONES I'm going to The Stud. Meet me out. Cleve goes. His energy is boundless. Harvey sits alone watching the bargoers return home through his front window. A bitter-sweetness lingers. A couple waves, one shouts out: 
JIM RIVALDO 
(YES) We'll deal with him tomorrow. Harvey is DOUSED with champagne. 
JUMP TO: Harvey is interviewed by a TV REPORTER. Jack squeezes his way under Harvey's arm and into the picture. 
CHANNEL 5 REPORTER Does this mean, as many straights are concerned, maybe the gays are taking over San Francisco? Are you going to be a Supervisor for all the people? 
HARVEY MILK I have to be. That's what I was elected for. I have to be there to open up the dialogue for the sensitivities of all people, all their problems, the problems that effect this city effect all of us. (toasts the camera) Thank you San Francisco! Thank you! 
77 EXT. MARKET STREET MONTAGE - DAY - JAN 1978 
SET TO MUSIC: In his old brown suit, Harvey walks to City Hall with a crowd of supporters. The familiar faces now include Jack Lira. 
78 EXT. CITY HALL - DAY 
On City Hall's steps, Mayor Moscone swears in HARVEY. 
HARVEY MILK I, Harvey Milk, do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of California against all enemies, foreign and domestic; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties upon which I am about to enter and during such time as I hold the office of Supervisor, City and County of San Francisco. Bulbs FLASH. A light rain begins to fall. Umbrellas go up. 
HARVEY MILK(CONT'D) Anita Bryant said gay people brought the drought to California. Looks to me like it's finally started raining! Cheers. Harvey is emboldened. 
79 INT. SCOTT'S APARTMENT / TV SET - MORNING 
Off a TV in Scott's NEW APARTMENT, we see a S.F. Morning show featuring new Supervisors, Harvey Milk and Dan White. 
HOST (ON TV) This will be the first time in many years that we've seen so many new faces on the Board of Supervisors. Do you think such diversity will cripple the Board? 
HARVEY MILK (ON TV) The name of the game on the Board is six votes to get anything passed. So, like it or not, Dan and I are now in bed together... politically speaking. THE CAMERA REVEALS SCOTT watching the program. He's been up all night. 
DAN WHITE (ON TV) I've assured Harvey here that my brochure's comments about "social deviants" referred more to junkies than to his people. See, I'm about to have my first child. I have to make sure this city remains a decent place to raise him. 
80 INT. TELEVISION STATION - MOMENTS LATER 
The segment over, sound assistants help Harvey and Dan remove their microphones. Harvey tries to draw Dan in: 
HARVEY MILK How long were you a fireman, Dan? 
DAN WHITE A couple of years. 
HARVEY MILK And before that... You were a police officer? Dan studies Harvey suspiciously... What's his point? 
DAN WHITE You have something against cops? 
HARVEY MILK No. They tend to have something against me. 
(MORE) 
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) (seeing Dan react uncomfortably) But firefighters. Now those are true heroes... They supported me in the last campaign. I support them fully. 
DAN WHITE I appreciate it. 
HARVEY MILK I meant what I said. I'd like to work together. Dan hesitantly accepts Harvey's handshake. It's a step. 
DAN WHITE (cracking a smile) I'll see you at the office, Mr. Milk. 
81 INT. CITY HALL - DAY 
Harvey goes through the metal detectors at the entrance and finds Cleve in a NEW SUIT waiting for the elevator. 
HARVEY Jack? 
JACK LIRA Welcome home, Harvey! I hope you're hungry. I only know how to cook one thing, but I make it good. 
HARVEY Did you... break in? 
JACK LIRA I asked the boy downstairs to let me in... 
HARVEY Danny? 
JACK LIRA He wouldn't let me in. So I came in this way. Your friends aren't very nice to me. 
HARVEY (avoiding the fight) I have a Town Hall meeting tonight, Jack. 
JACK LIRA You work too hard. I'm sorry about your window. I'll fix it tomorrow. (turning on the charm) Are you surprised?! 
HARVEY MILK Jack, I have to go. I have an invitation to a party tomorrow. Lots of rich people, politicians. We could get all dressed up... Jack turns up the music, takes Harvey's hands and guides him through a simple dance. 
JACK LIRA So I could be the first lady? 
HARVEY MILK Uh-huh. 
JACK LIRA I watched TV here today. All day. I saw All My Children. They killed Margo. I knew it was going to happen. They try and trick you but it never works. 
HARVEY MILK (enjoying this) You always see it coming? 
JACK LIRA What? Killing the blonde? Every time. I'm good with that. (gets slow, sensual) I think now the old lady is going to have an affair. Then she'll get killed or married. Always one or the other. Dead or married. Jack starts dancing with Harvey again. It's sweet, intimate. 
HARVEY MILK If I make you a key, you won't break my windows again, right? 
JACK LIRA That's right. The dance lesson is a lovely distraction. Harvey won't be going back to work tonight. 
86 INT. CATHOLIC CHURCH - DAY 
Harvey watches water pour over an INFANT BOY. He tries hard to feel comfortable, but he's the only Jew, and likely the only gay man at Dan's child's baptism. Dan looks to Harvey, the proud father. Harvey waves. 
87 INT. CATHOLIC CHURCH - LATER 
Harvey and Dan have pulled themselves away. 
HARVEY MILK I'm proposing a citywide ordinance. It ensures that a person who already has a job can't be fired for their orientation. 
DAN WHITE I'm not sure my constituents would favor that. Dan looks over to his WIFE and NEWBORN SON. 
HARVEY MILK Is anyone else here from the Board? 
DAN WHITE You're the only one who showed up I think. 
HARVEY MILK Were you christened here? 
DAN WHITE Yes. Right here. Same Parish. My grandma immigrated here when this was an Irish Catholic city. The City of St. Francis... A lot's changed here since then. 
HARVEY MILK You're more like one of us now... an outsider. 
DAN WHITE You're not like most homosexuals, are you, Harvey? 
HARVEY MILK Do you know a lot of "homosexuals?" 
DAN WHITE (smiles, then) Say, where do you stand on the Psychiatric Center the City's been pushing into my district? 
HARVEY MILK Privacy's our enemy. You want real political power? Let's tell the truth for a change. Starting here. If there's anybody in this room, right now, who hasn't told their families, their friends, their employers... Do it. Now. 
ANNE KRONENBERG My folks know already. A beat. The room is silent. Dick looks ill. 
DICK PABICH I haven't told my father yet... 
HARVEY MILK (a beat, then) People vote two to one for us if they know just one of us. 
(BEAT) Cleve, show Dick where you keep your phone. 
CLEVE JONES It's in the bedroom. After a moment, Dick RISES and follows Cleve out of the room. People are stunned by Harvey's outrageous demand. Harvey sees Scott GLARING at him. 
93 EXT. CLEVE'S APARTMENT / STAIRCASE - LATER 
The meeting is breaking up, and Scott lets his NEW BOYFRIEND go ahead. Harvey ducks away from Jack and intercepts Scott. 
HARVEY MILK I thought you were done with politics. 
SCOTT SMITH Politics. Not the movement. What the hell was that in there? 
HARVEY MILK The movement needs people to be up- front. Why were you fighting me? 
SCOTT SMITH You were the biggest closet case alive in New York. You told me and all your boyfriends to keep our 
(MORE) 
SCOTT SMITH (CONT'D) traps shut. You were the hypocrite in there. 
HARVEY MILK My parents are gone. My brother knows. I'm sure they knew. 
SCOTT SMITH I had to listen to your phone calls home to Mom. Hear you deny that I existed. You want to be "normal" as bad as any of us. More than any of us... Those are kids in there. You're asking them to lose their families. 
HARVEY MILK If their families won't love them for who they are, who they really are, then they should lose them. 
SCOTT SMITH That's fucking insane. 
HARVEY MILK (re: Scott's new Boyfriend) Who's he? Do you live together? 
SCOTT SMITH Someone I'm seeing. He's good for me. He makes me stay home at nights, out of the bars... 
HARVEY MILK (quietly, so Jack doesn't hear) I miss you. 
SCOTT SMITH Oh, Harvey, don't... (eyeing Jack down the street) What's that about? 
JACK LIRA (calling out) Har-veyyyyy! 
HARVEY MILK He needs me. Scott nods. THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN HARVEY'S ACHILLES HEAL. He walks away from Harvey, leaving him alone. 
94 INT. CITY HALL / SUPERVISORS' CHAMBERS - DAY 
Dianne bangs her gavel like a mad woman. Harvey's adamant. 
HARVEY MILK DIANNE FEINSTEIN I have told no lies here Supervisor Milk, you will today or to Supervisor White come to order. in the past-- 
HARVEY MILK --I want it noted that I never promised to back moving any Mental Health Centers. I greatly respect Supervisor White, but I would like his remarks stricken. 
DIANNE FEINSTEIN Duly noted. We will take a recess before recording the vote. Fellow Supervisor, CAROL RUTH SILVER, leans over to Harvey. 
CAROL RUTH SILVER Thank you, Harvey. Harvey is preoccupied with Dan approaching. He leans back. 
HARVEY MILK You're an activist. Take it. March them. (off Cleve, unsure) March those people up to the front doors of City Hall. When it looks really bad, the city's first gay Supervisor will come out and play peacemaker. We save the city from a riot. We can turn this night into more political power for the cause. 
CLEVE JONES I can't do it like you do it. 
HARVEY MILK I won't always be here. Somebody else will have to take over. (looking him in the eye) I need you to be the scary one now. 
100 EXT. CASTRO AND MARKET STREET - NIGHT 
A massive, angry crowd has gathered. Baby-faced Cleve takes a makeshift stage. He lifts the bullhorn and with nerves, reads a speech. Its pages blow about. CLEVE'S POV: Harvey watches from afar. Encouraging him. 
CLEVE JONES Forty years ago tonight, the gay citizens of Germany found out they no longer had civil rights. Tomorrow morning, the gay citizens of Wichita will also awaken to find that they too have lost their civil rights. You have whistles. You use them when we have been attacked. Tonight we have been attacked. Initially Cleve is successful, but then the crowd turns, marching toward City Hall without him. 
CLEVE JONES(CONT'D) Fuck. Shit. Harvey! Cleve runs as fast as he can to cut through the crowd, to get to the front. He gets on his walkie-talkie. 
CLEVE JONES (CONT'D) Get the press to the overpass! ON HARVEY: Ducking through EMPTY STREETS, trying to get AHEAD OF THE CROWD and beat them to City Hall. 
Cleve gets to the head of the crowd. 
CLEVE JONES (CONT'D) Move... Left... Move... Left... 
JIM RIVALDO (charging up) What are you doing? Where's Harvey? 
CLEVE JONES We're shutting down traffic, both directions. Cleve looks up at the press that's arrived on the overpass above, and turns to two HIPPIE KIDS near the front. 
CLEVE JONES(CONT'D) Disconnect the power arms! The boys climb up a trolley and knock down the power arms. Sparks fly. Brakes squeal. The press snaps photos. 
100B INT. CASTRO STREET BAR - NIGHT 
The angry protesters march past the large glass windows of TWIN PEAKS bar. Unlike the Dade County march, the bar is empty. The patrons are already in the streets. 
101 INT. CITY HALL - LATER 
Harvey RACES to his office. He stops at a mirror to straighten his tie and collect himself. OUTSIDE: The SOUND of the ANGRY MOB on City Hall's front steps. "Civil Rights or Civil War!" Someone THROWS A ROCK at the City Hall doors. Harvey rushes out the front doors, pushing past the police to greet THE MOB on City Hall's front steps. Through the glass doors we see Cleve rush up and hand Harvey his bullhorn: 
HARVEY MILK Hello. My name is Harvey Milk, and I want to recruit you. (AN ENORMOUS CHEER rises) I want to recruit you for the fight to preserve our democracy against the Anita Bryants and John Briggs who are trying to legalize bigotry! We have a choice to make. The fight is at our doors. We must either go back in the closet and shut it tight, or fight... History shows 
(MORE) 
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) that if we continue to fight, we... will... win. 
101B INT. CITY HALL / HARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY 
Jim, Dick, Anne, Michael, Frank and Cleve are all in the office. The FRONT PAGE of the Examiner features a PICTURE OF CLEVE AND HARVEY ARM IN ARM on City Hall's steps. Cleve is jazzed. Harvey stews. 
CLEVE JONES They're calling it a "successful mediation." You're a God damn hero. Fuck. It came this close to a riot. 
HARVEY Lose the note cards next time. Your job is just to say into that bullhorn what they're all feeling. 
CLEVE JONES You're just jealous it wasn't you out there. 
HARVEY MILK We're losing Prop Six by 60% and you're over there celebrating a riot. I need more visibility... (the real problem:) If we're going to beat this thing, we have to get Briggs to acknowledge us. Harvey steps away, hot, pensive. Anne gets quiet. 
ANNE KRONENBERG Every paper's calling Prop Six the main event now. We lose this, we'll have anti-gay laws in all fifty states, and Briggs won't return our calls for a public debate. 
DICK PABICH He's ignoring us to death. 
HARVEY MILK (steaming back in) We need something populist. What's the number one complaint about city life? 
CLEVE JONES The piss smell in the Tenderloin. 
HARVEY MILK Listen, I know you're disappointed about the Psychiatric Center... What else do you have coming up? 
DAN WHITE Now you need something from me. You want my me to join in with the Queers on this Prop Six business? 
HARVEY MILK We prefer the word "gay," Dan. Just as I'm sure you prefer the word, "Irish-American" to "Mick." 
DAN WHITE Harvey, our society can't exist without the family, without the church. 
HARVEY MILK We're not against those things. 
DAN WHITE You're not? Can two men reproduce? 
HARVEY MILK (a smile) No. But, we keep trying! 
(SERIOUSLY) 
(MORE) 
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) C'mon, Dan. You're channeling Anita and Briggs... we can work together. On something... 
DAN WHITE Okay. You introduce an initiative for Supervisor pay raises. 
HARVEY MILK (anything but that) It's a bad time politically. I have an election next year. 
DAN WHITE You asked for something. Introduce pay raises. I can't take care of my family on our salaries. You don't have that problem, do you? Dan's AIDE steps into the doorway. She seems surprised to see Harvey in Dan's office. 
DAN WHITE (CONT'D) Mr. Milk, You'll excuse me, I have a development meeting. Dan goes. 
108 INT. A SAN FRANCISCO HALL - NIGHT 
A crowd sings âHappy Birthday.â One after another, Harvey's guests throw CREAM PIES in his face. RICK AND DAVID GOODSTEIN INCLUDED. A PEACE OFFERING. Harvey wipes pie from his eyes. In the B.G. the black drag queen sensation, SYLVESTER, breaks into his top 10 anthem, "You Make Me Feel." It's a who's who of San Francisco's political elite. Jack scoots up to Harvey. 
HARVEY MILK What's wrong, Taco Bell? 
JACK LIRA Anne and Cleve tried to cut me out of your table. You should fire them. 
HARVEY MILK I'll take it under consideration. Why don't you get us a drink? A kiss and Jack heads to the bar. Scott approaches. 
SCOTT SMITH Don't let Cezar Chavez hear you calling him Taco Bell. 
HARVEY MILK He's getting better. He's enrolling in classes on Monday. Scott wipes PIE CREAM from Harvey's jacket. 
SCOTT SMITH I remember when your birthdays were a bit less... lavish. More intimate. 
HARVEY MILK Who invited you? Anne? 
SCOTT SMITH My boyfriend got an invitation. I was his "plus one." 
HARVEY MILK Congratulations. It was a tough ticket to get. 
SCOTT SMITH Congratulations to you. Looks like you're part of the Machine now. (Harvey looks away, toward Jack) You can do better. 
HARVEY MILK When I come home to Jack, I don't have to talk politics or talk intelligently. Or even talk. 
(SELF-DEPRECATING) And where's an old man like me going to get such a good looking young man, right? 
SCOTT SMITH You're not so old. You look handsome... Happy 48th. Looks like you're gonna make it to fifty after- all, Mr. Milk. Scott gives Harvey a BIRTHDAY KISS. 
109 INT. A SAN FRANCISCO HALL - LATER THAT NIGHT 
JOHN BRIGGS (getting more lost) No, no, I'm not saying that at all-- 
HARVEY MILK That's what you just said. 
JOHN BRIGGS No. I'm saying that we cannot prevent child molestation so let's cut our odds down and take out the homosexual group and keep in the heterosexual group-- Harvey laughs in disbelief at the asinine argument. Briggs looks down to his notes, lost. Harvey takes the opportunity to rip into the State Senator: 
HARVEY MILK (directly to Briggs) --Sir, in your own drive for personal power, how many careers are you willing to see destroyed? How many lives will you destroy in your lust for power, and when will you stop? The crowd boos, rails. This isn't San Francisco, it's Orange County. In the audience, Dick Pabich sweats, taken aback by the level of hatred. Harvey tries to maintain his composure. 
120 EXT. CASTRO STREET - NIGHT 
Harvey heads home from work. He starts into his store. He sees JACK LIRA'S SHADOW through the curtains upstairs, and turns instead to the cafe next door. 
121 INT. CASTRO CAFE - NIGHT 
Harvey sits down at the bar. The WAITER pours a coffee for him. Harvey looks up to the TV. HARVEY'S POV: DAN WHITE ON TV talking to a news reporter. It feels as if Dan is talking directly to Harvey. 
DAN WHITE All I'm really saying is, if we don't protect ourselves with this kind of legislation, a transvestite can show up at a public school with all the qualifications for teaching and they can't refuse to hire him. 
122 INT. CITY HALL / HARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY 
Harvey rushes from a packed session in the Supervisors' Chambers to his office. Anne is behind him. He picks up the phone. It seems urgent. 
HARVEY MILK Hey Jack, what's wrong? 
123 INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - INTERCUT 
JACK LIRA Nothing. I just want to know when you'll be home. 
HARVEY MILK You just had them pull me out of my big vote on the dog shit ordinance. Did you do this on purpose, Jack? 
JACK LIRA It's poop, Harvey. Aren't I more important than poop? 
HARVEY MILK Yes, but... I don't know when I'll be home. Maybe 6. 6:15. 
JACK LIRA Fine. 6:15. Harvey hangs up. His patience is slipping. He looks up in time to see Dan heading down the hall with his briefcase. 
124 INT. CITY HALL / SUPERVISORS' CHAMBERS HALLWAY - DAY 
Harvey catches up to Dan who is on his way out. 
HARVEY MILK Dan? How's the baby? 
DAN WHITE You didn't bring up Supervisor pay raises. In fact, I heard you plan to publicly oppose them. 
HARVEY MILK I heard you planned to vote against them too, Dan. Were you trying to set me up? 
DAN WHITE (parrotting Harvey 
EARLIER) 
(MORE) 
DAN WHITE (CONT'D) It's not a good time for me to bring it up. Politically. 
HARVEY MILK Dan, there's a vote to approve the police desegregation settlement, give me that and I'll consider backing pay raises. 
DAN WHITE (suddenly very dark) I don't trade votes... unlike you, the way I was raised, we believe in right and wrong. Moral and immoral. 
HARVEY MILK Black skin and White in your police department? (Dan steams) Dan, even Ronald Reagan's come out against Proposition Six. You're looking more and more out of touch. 
GIRL No. What the heck are you? 
HARVEY MILK Oh, me? I'm an elected official. I run this city. 
He makes a show of it. She smiles. He hands her the flower he's been holding onto all afternoon. 
130 INT. "NO ON SIX" CENTER / MARKET STREET - NIGHT 
THIS IS THE MOMENT. Harvey watches aides on the phones comb districts for voting results. Jim fills up a map on the wall. 
DICK PABICH San Bernadino is coming in. Not good. 
HARVEY MILK Of course not. How not good? 
MICHAEL WONG 60% for Briggs. Same in Fresno. 
HARVEY MILK Dear God, little Lotus Blossom. Harvey is stunned. Other districts follow with similar results. They go up in red on the map. 
JIM RIVALDO Imperial is 69% "for" so far. 
HARVEY MILK Put it up on the board. Harvey tries to stomach this major defeat, loss after loss. He starts reflexively tying his tie in a knot. Cleve comes up to Harvey, concerned. 
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) The whole world is watching this. This is San Francisco we're about to lose. Are you ready? 
CLEVE JONES I can have 15,000 people in an hour. But there's gonna be riots if this thing passes. 
HARVEY MILK (darkens, pointed) There goddamn better be. 
CLEVE JONES (stops, a beat, then:) What are you telling me? 
HARVEY MILK I can't say it because I'm a public official, but for God's sake, if this thing passes, fight back. Cleve is stunned, holding the weight of Harvey's words. Harvey's focus is interrupted when Anne brings him the phone. 
ANNE KRONENBERG Don Amador down in LA. 
HARVEY (reluctantly answers) Kind of a bad time, Don. 
YOUNG TEEN (V.O.) No sir, this is Paul. Don just gave me the phone. 
HARVEY MILK Paul who? 
YOUNG TEEN (V.O.) You talked to me on the phone a year or so ago. I'm from Minnesota... I'm in a wheelchair. REVEAL: The boy in his wheelchair on the other end. 
HARVEY MILK (a beat to take it in, then:) I thought you were a goner, Paul. 
YOUNG TEEN I'm sorry. I should have called. When I read in the paper that you won the Supervisor seat, I got a friend to put me on a bus to LA. 
HARVEY MILK Who did you know in Los Angeles? 
YOUNG TEEN Nobody. That's the uh... I just didn't want to die anymore, sir. (Harvey's at a loss for words) I met your friend Don down here. I turned 18. I voted today against Prop Six... Thank you, Mr. Milk. 
HARVEY MILK No. You did this all by yourself. 
YOUNG TEEN I don't think I'd be alive right now without you, sir. You were right about LA. It's like gay Disney World. 
HARVEY MILK Then you have to see San Francisco! 
YOUNG TEEN Okay. I will. Don wanted me to um... congratulate you on what he says looks like a big win for us tonight. Congratulations Mr. Milk. Harvey turns back to the map. Jim Rivaldo is now coloring in LA county with green. On the other end of the phone, Harvey's friend in LA, Don Amador, is back on the line. 
DON AMADOR (V.O.) It looks like we've taken LA County, Harvey. By 65%. It's huge. 
136 INT. TV NEWS REPORT - DAY 
ACTUAL FOOTAGE: Channel 5 reporting from Dan White's street: 
DAVID FOWLER (ON TV) Most people were surprised when Dan White quit last Friday citing financial difficulties. Now we've heard that White is asking for his Supervisor job back. But many say-- 
137 INT. CITY HALL / HARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY 
Harvey, watching on the small TV set in his office. 
DAVID FOWLER (ON TV) --White gave up all of his political chits when he resigned without making any arrangements. The news story transitions in the B.G. as Harvey gets up. 
NEWS ANCHOR (ON TV/BG) The city of San Francisco is in disbelief. Four-hundred bodies have been found thus far in Jonestown, Guyana. Leader of the People's Temple, Jim Jones... 
138 INT. CITY HALL / DAN WHITE'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER 
Harvey heads to Dan's office. He toys with the nameplate. Something bittersweet lingers. He walks in. HARVEY'S POV: On City Hall's lawn, Dan is with the press. He looks up, seeing Harvey in his office window. They make eye contact. It bears all the awkwardness of a relationship lost. 
139 EXT. CITY HALL - MOMENTS LATER 
Something's snapped. With adolescent frustration in evidence, Dan is with his wife, the press and a few supporters. 
DAN WHITE It was a major decision on Friday that I had to come... to arrive at. But since that time, people unknown to me, plus my family and friends, have come to me and stated that they want me to stay in office, that they support me... So I'm asking the Mayor to let me stay in office to serve the people... 
140 INT. CITY HALL / MAYOR MOSCONE'S OFFICE - DAY 
Harvey is firm, his hands planted on the Mayor's desk. 
HARVEY MILK He gets dragged into a closed door meeting with the Police Officers Association, and comes out demanding his job back? What do you think they promised him? Or worse, how did they threaten him? 
MAYOR MOSCONE A man has the right to change his mind. Give me some peace. 
HARVEY MILK How many of our propositions has Dan shut down? We could finally settle this police desegregation nonsense. Cement rent control. It's his vote on this Board that stands in our way. 
MAYOR MOSCONE I get it, Harvey. I've been lobbied all week. Enough. 
HARVEY MILK Let me just remind you that you're up for re-election. If you re- appoint Dan, you lose the gay vote. They listen to me. You won't get elected dog catcher. 
MAYOR MOSCONE (stern, silent, a beat, then:) I'll make my decision on Monday. (as Harvey's on his way out, with a wry grin) You know what you sounded like just now? Boss Tweed or Mayor Daly. 
HARVEY MILK (returns the smile) A "homosexual" with a bit of power... rather scary isn't it, Mr. Mayor? OFF Harvey. He's come a long way. 
OPERA MUSIC CROSSES THE CUT TO: 
141 INT. SAN FRANCISCO OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT 
Harvey sits in a balcony seat of the filled, darkened opera house next to Brazilian opera star BIDU SAYAO, 76. He's enraptured by a production of TOSCA. ON STAGE IT'S "O Scarpia, we shall meet before God!" Refusing to be taken prisoner, Tosca jumps from the walls of the castle set to her death. 
142 INT. DAN WHITE'S HOME / LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Mary Ann offers the phone to Dan. Dan takes it. 
DAN WHITE (into the phone) Yes. This is Dan White. 
KCBS REPORTER (V.O.) I'm Barbra Taylor from KCBS. I'm interested in your reaction. I've received information from the Mayor's office that you won't be getting your job back. 
DAN WHITE I'm sorry. I don't know anything about that. Dan hangs up on her. 
143 INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT 
HARVEY MILK (grins ear to ear) Heaven forbid, Dianne. 
148 INT. CITY HALL / MAYOR MOSCONE'S WAITING ROOM - SAME 
The MAYOR'S SECRETARY sits at her desk. Shouting can be heard from inside his office. 
149 INT. CITY HALL / MAYOR MOSCONE'S OFFICE - SAME 
Moscone leads Dan White to the bar beside his office. Dan is enraged. Moscone lights a cigarette. 
DAN WHITE You can't take this away from me! Moscone has his back turned, pouring them cocktails. 
MAYOR MOSCONE The issue is what's fair, for the people of your district. Take some time off. Spend it with your family. 
Moscone finishes pouring two cocktails, and turns to see Dan White brandishing his revolver. 
150 INT. CITY HALL / MAYOR MOSCONE'S WAITING ROOM - SAME 
Moscone's Secretary, and a WAITING MAN note the THREE DULL THUDS, not so different than a backfire. The secretary looks out the window, concerned. The waiting man checks his watch. 
151 INT. CITY HALL / MAYOR MOSCONE'S OFFICE - SAME 
Still gripped in his hand, Moscone's cigarette burns a hole in his tie. 
152 INT. CITY HALL / SUPERVISORS' OFFICES - MOMENTS LATER 
Dan walks past Dick Pabich, past Dianne's office. Harvey's voice can be heard down the hall. He sounds up-beat, 
OPTIMISTIC: 
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) This time next year we're marching on Washington D.C. It'll look like Market and Castro, but with a million people. Write that down. Tell President Carter we're coming after him next. I'm going to deposit this. I'll be back in 20 minutes. Dan arrives at Harvey's office door. Harvey is with a FRIEND, preparing to leave, surprised to see Dan in his doorway. 
DAN WHITE Say, Harve, can I see you for a minute? 
HARVEY MILK Sure. Dan walks Harvey down the hall to his old office. 
153 INT. CITY HALL / DAN WHITE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
Harvey walks in first. Dan stays between Harvey and the door. Dan closes it. Harvey smiles, sensing something is off. Dan draws his revolver. Harvey raises his hand. Dan Fires. The bullet rips through Harvey's hand and down his arm. 
HARVEY MILK Oh no... N-- Dan Fires again, silencing Harvey's cry for help. 
Harvey turns away. Another bullet rips into his chest, and he falls to his knees, now facing the window. He staggers toward it. The moment is extended as we see Harvey's POV of the Opera House outside the window, and the Castro beyond it. HOLD ON HARVEY, gazing out at his beloved city. Dan puts his revolver to the back of Harvey's head. HE FIRES. And just like that, Harvey falls. 
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D) Last week I got a phone call-- 
156 INT. FLASH BACK - HARVEY'S KITCHEN - RECORDED WILL 
Harvey is still speaking into the tape recorder... 
HARVEY --from Altoona, Pennsylvania, and the voice was quite young, and the person said... "Thanks." You've got to elect gay people so that that young child and the thousands upon thousand like him know there's hope... hope for a better world... 
157 INT. MEMORIAL SERVICE / SAN FRANCISCO - EARLY EVENING 
Scott and Anne enter a sparsely attended memorial service. Most of the seats are empty. The speaker is unfamiliar, some appointed CITY OFFICIAL. 
SCOTT SMITH (finally crumbling, tears roll) Where is everybody? Didn't anyone give a damn? 
158 INT. FLASH BACK - HARVEY'S KITCHEN - RECORDED WILL

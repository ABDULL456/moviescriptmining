CLOWN! His eyes SNAP OPEN, focused, the force inside him now fully in control. Burton looks at Michael with calm recognition, his voice GUTTURAL..INHUMAN. A man possessed. 
BURTON What are you doing, Michael?   These weren't your orders. Estevez looks at his partner with confusion. 
ESTEVEZ What did you say? Michael, however, seems to know exactly who he's talking to. 
MICHAEL I'm following my own orders now. 
BURTON Then you will die along with the child. 
ESTEVEZ Burton, you fuckin' know this guy?! BLAM! Burton shoots his partner in the head. Estevez drops, leaving Michael without cover. Burton re-aims, but Michael's faster, already FIRING back. Bullets rip up the concrete. SMASH!   The squad car window SHATTERS, Burton's chest EXPLODING! 
And down he GOES, leaving Michael the only one left standing. Smoke rising from his gun. With soldier-like efficiency, Michael picks up the rifle bags and begins to load them into the trunk of the squad car. He gets in the car and FLOORS IT, ROARING AWAY, as the FLICKERING STREET LAMPS FINALLY GO OUT IN RAPID SUCCESSION, a wave chasing him, PLUNGING THE ENTIRE CITY INTO DARKNESS... 
SMASH CUT TO: 
JEEP HANSON (LATE TEENS) Bolts awake.   Breathing hard.   Covered with sweat. 
INT. JEEP'S ROOM - JUST BEFORE DAWN 
Jeep switches on a lamp, illuminating this incredibly cramped bedroom. Not much larger than the bed itself. He's got shaggy hair, a sensitive face, clearly not big on sunlight. 
EXT. DESERT - PRE-DAWN 
A couple of ancient SILVERSTREAM TRAILERS are bathed in the eerie blue light of night's final moments. It looks like the trailers haven't moved from this patch of barren ground in decades. A single strand of colored Christmas lights dot the trailers roof lines, marking the season. One of the trailer doors CREAKS open and Jeep steps wearily out into the cool western morning. Home. Nothing but desert for miles in all directions, save for a two lane HIGHWAY and a weather beaten TRUCK STOP DINER that Jeep and his father will open for business in a few hours. Jeep gazes up to the diner's slanted roof where a large sign glows like a beacon in the darkness: 
"PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB" A beat as Jeep contemplates the sign. 
CHARLIE (O.S.) You okay, Jeep? Jeep turns to see CHARLIE, a very pregnant girl of about twenty, standing in the trailer doorway, rubbing the sleep from her eyes. Even with the trailer-trash veneer, she's strikingly beautiful. 
JEEP Sorry to wake you, Charlie. 
CHARLIE (stepping out of the trailer, hands on her 
BELLY) Wasn't you. He's been kickin' up a storm all night. Must know somethin' I don't. She approaches Jeep.   Sees the strain in his eyes. 
CHARLIE Another bad dream? He struggles for a moment, nods. 
CHARLIE It's just stress, Jeep, that's all. You do too much worryin'. About this place. About your dad. 
(BEAT) About me... A glimmer of a smile crosses Jeep's face. 
JEEP You're the only thing I like worrying about. 
CHARLIE See what I mean? You're worried about a girl eight months pregnant and it isn't even your baby. Now that's enough to give anybody nightmares. Jeep turns away, dejected. 
JEEP Go ahead, make fun of me. Everybody else does. 
CHARLIE (turns him back around) C'mon, I was only kiddin'. You know how much I appreciate everything you and Bob are doing for me, but a month from now, this baby'll have a new family and I'll have to start thinkin' about what the hell I'm doin' with my life. This is not news Jeep wants to hear. 
JEEP So you're still going through with it...? 
SANDRA I'm being punished for something, I know it. 
Across the diner, Audrey goes back to swaying dreamily to the music, which is suddenly overtaken by BASS BUMPIN' HIP-HOP. 
CUT TO: 
DRIFTING OVER A VAST EXPANSE OF WESTERN DESERT The noontime sun bakes the strip of highway slicing through this barren country. A BLACK CADILLAC ESCALADE blazes a path.   HEAVY BEATS thunder from within. 
INT. ESCALADE - DRIVING - CONTINUOUS 
The stereo in this rig could shake mountains. KYLE WILLIAMS (late 20's) handsome as hell, thug style. A straight up bad boy. He passes a weathered road sign: 
"ENTERING PARADISE FALLS, NEXT SERVICES 50 MILES" Kyle's expression says this is not good news. He grabs his cell phone off the passenger seat.   No signal. 
KYLE Shit... He spots the truck stop diner just up the road ahead... 
EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS 
The Escalade pulls off the highway and rolls to a stop at the lonely row of old gas pumps. Kyle gets out and surveys the scenery with dismay. Now in the daytime we see this is truly a place time forgot. Attached to the diner is a MECHANIC'S BAY. Grease stains and rusty car parts litter the ground. Behind the place is the SILVERSTREAM TRAILER we saw Jeep step out of earlier. The only thing here that looks fairly new is the UHAUL TRUCK parked in front of the garage with its hood up. Kyle grabs a crumpled hand drawn map from the front seat and flattens it out on the roof of the car. He spins it around. Which way is north? 
KYLE Darren, your fuckin' directions suck, man. He checks his cell phone again. No chance of a signal way out here. So he shuffles around to the side of the diner in search of a pay phone. The good news is that he finds one.   The bad news is that it's been broken for ten years. Leaning next to the broken phone, however, is Charlie wearing a shabby, faded WAITRESS uniform stretched tight around her very pregnant belly. Adding to her perfect mother-to-be look is that cigarette dangling from her lips. The plastic name tag pinned to her chest says "CHARLIE". 
KYLE Hey... She eyes him, mildly intrigued, takes a drag. 
KYLE You know that shit right there ain't good for the baby. She lets out a long slow exhale. 
CHARLIE Guess I should think `bout quittin' then. 
KYLE Now hold on, girl, let me bum one before you do. 
CHARLIE You can buy a whole pack inside. 
KYLE Tell ya what. You let me have one of yours, and I'll give you two from the new pack you're gonna sell me. She considers him for a moment, then pulls out a cigarette. Lights it off the end of hers then hands it to him. Kyle takes a drag, pulls out his crumpled map. 
KYLE Am I in the right place? 
CHARLIE (peers at the map) Only if nowhere's right, `cause that's where you are. 
KYLE Sonuvabitch. There another phone around here? You know, one that works? 
CHARLIE Bob'll probably let you use the diner phone if you ask him real nice...And pay `im somethin'. 
KYLE I can handle that.   You got pancakes here? 
CHARLIE Yeah, we got a buttermilk stack for three seventy-five. We also got french toast for four dollars if you're into that. I personally like the pancakes though. 
JEEP (O.S.) You okay, Charlie? They both turn to see Jeep behind the diner, wearing mechanic's coveralls and holding a DUSTY OLD CRIB. Charlie quickly hides her cigarette behind her back. Busted. 
CHARLIE Yeah, I'm okay. This guy's just lost. Jeep nods, uncertain, eyes Kyle another moment, then he shuffles along out of sight. Charlie brings the cigarette back up to her lips. An awkward beat. 
KYLE Three seventy-five, huh? 
JEEP Nothin'... Jeep tries feebly to block his path, fails. Bob looks down at the crib with dismay. 
JEEP Found it under a bunch of stuff in the storage shed. I know you never like to throw anything away... Bob considers him, softens. 
BOB Whaddya doin'? 
JEEP What...? 
BOB Jeep, I like Charlie. I do. And I think it's real good of you to lend her a helping hand, but she is not your responsibility. 
JEEP (heard this before, pushes past him) Oh whatever, leave me alone. 
BOB Don't walk away from me while I'm talkin' to you! 
EXT. PARADISE GAS `N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS 
Jeep walks out toward the gas pumps, but Bob's right alongside him, not giving up. 
BOB How long you gonna follow her around like a puppy dog? Cleanin' up the messes she makes while she steps out with every guy around here other than you?! Jeep stiffens.   Turns to his father: 
JEEP Don't say that about her!     She's not like that! 
Bob gives Jeep a hard stare.    Yeah, she is. 
BOB You really think she's gonna stick around here after that baby's born and off her hands? Jeeps shakes his head, burns. 
JEEP Look, I know it doesn't make any sense to you, but it's just something I have to do. Bob sighs, feels for his boy. 
BOB (points up at the PARADISE FALLS sign) See that up there? Your mother thought I was crazy for wanting to buy this place, middle of nowhere...But I just knew this was what I was supposed to do. Told your mom, "just wait." Told her when they finally ran the freeway through here like they were plannin' on, this place would be like Grand Central Station. 
(BEAT) But I was wrong. The freeway never came and now the only people who ever stop here are the ones who are lost. 
(BEAT) And your mom? Well she got tired of waitin'. 
JEEP C'mon Dad. You can't blame yourself for what she did-- 
BOB Yeah, I can. And I'm sayin' you're about to make the same damn mistake I made, believing in something that's never gonna happen...Or someone. 
(BEAT) It's time for you to move on from this place, Jeep. I don't wanna see you wake up one morning old and pissed off, realizing you're lost just like everybody else who stops here. 
Jeep looks up at his father, his words hanging heavily.    A tough pill to swallow. 
BOB Now get to work on that truck. I wanna have these people on the road by nightfall. Bob walks back into the diner. Jeep is about to turn back to the garage when he notices something off in the distance. Ominous DARK CLOUDS line the horizon to the south like a living wall. He shifts his gaze up the highway to the north. Same thing. DARK CLOUDS are pushing their way over the distant mountains. A storm is coming. 
INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB - SAME 
Bob reenters the diner to find Kyle sitting at the counter, digging into a plate of banana pancakes. Kyle is about to address him again, when something else steals Bob's attention. 
BOB (holding up a silencing 
HAND) Yeah, wait a minute. The TV has gone on the fritz again.   Only now the image is mostly snow. Bob climbs back onto the chair.   Faces the TV. 
Kyle sits at a messy desk in this dark, wood paneled back office, phone to his ear. 
KYLE (CONT'D) (on phone) Cuz a father should be able to talk to his son, that's why. Now put `im on the phone. (a beat then a smile) Is that my little man...? Yeah, well I'm working hard, so that I can be with you. You bein' good? (strange STATIC can be 
HEARD) Wait... You're breakin' up. Hello...? (hangs up in frustration) Shit! Kyle stews a beat, then picks up the phone to redial. Frowns. No dial tone. 
KYLE What the hell... He keeps trying.    Nothing. 
HOWARD (V.O.) Maybe there was an earthquake? 
INT. DINER - SAME 
Everyone is looking at Howard. 
HOWARD They keep sayin' we're overdue for a big one. 
PERCY Lot a folks could be hurt. 
BOB Not if it was centered in the desert. 
HOWARD Exactly.    Could be nothing to worry about. 
SANDRA So then why's the TV out? 
HOWARD Maybe it just hit the relay stations. Aren't those usually in remote areas? 
BOB Yeah, `cause of the radiation they give off. 
PERCY There ain't no radiation comin' from those things. Plus that don't explain the radio being out too. Some of those stations broadcast over hundreds of miles. Any quake that big and we would a felt it. 
CHARLIE Percy's right. I didn't feel nothing. 
AUDREY Maybe it's a terrorist attack or something...? 
SANDRA (covers her mouth) Oh god... Everyone considers that grimly, then: 
BOB Well, for cryin' out loud. There's no use in speculating. I'll just call my brother up in Needles. He must a heard something. 
KYLE (O.S.) I don't think so. Kyle has reappeared in the diner. 
BOB Whaddya talkin' about? 
KYLE Phone's dead. Just tried to make a call. 
BOB You're shittin' me. Kyle shakes his head, sits down at the counter. 
SANDRA Oh, this is just great. 
BOB Relax, Mrs. Anderson. Nothing to get excited about. Probably just working on the lines. 
(MORE) 
GLADYS Oh, don't worry yourself about that, sweetheart. It'll all be over soon. Sandra nods at the old woman, unsure of what to make of that response. The fly that was circling her head, now lands on GLADYS'S FACE. It crawls across her cheek without her reacting in the least. Howard and Sandra exchange looks.    Creepy. The door JINGLES and Jeep walks in. He heads straight for a quiet huddle with Bob. All the while though, he keeps one eye fixed on the old lady sitting at the table near the Andersons. Something about her... 
JEEP The carburetor's shot.    Don't know why. Looks brand new. 
BOB (glances over at the 
ANDERSONS) Ah, shit. They're gonna be pissed. 
JEEP I could try to rebuild it, but it'd take a while, and I don't think we have all the parts. If we call right now, we might be able to get a new one down here tomorrow morning. 
BOB That's not gonna happen.    Goddamn phone's out. 
JEEP What? Across the diner, Charlie places a bloody red steak in front of Gladys. 
GLADYS Thank you, dear. How far along are you? 
Charlie rests a hand on her belly. 
CHARLIE Just about there. 
GLADYS The father must be very proud. 
CHARLIE I wouldn't know. 
GLADYS You mean he's... 
CHARLIE Out of sight. Out of mind. 
GLADYS Oh, I see.     So you're not married, I take it? A fly lands on Gladys's steak. Charlie tries to wave it away. But another one lands in its place. 
CHARLIE Nope. Gladys starts to dig in to the steak with a real ferociousness you wouldn't expect from an old lady.   More FLIES begin to land on her body. On her food. Charlie is still trying to wave them away. 
GLADYS That's too bad. 
CHARLIE No, I prefer it that way. I don't a need a man tellin' me what to do. 
GLADYS But what about the baby? 
CHARLIE I've got it under control. 
GLADYS Yeah, but it's gonna burn. Charlie freezes. The Andersons turn to look as well.   Kyle glances over from the counter. 
CHARLIE What did you just say? 
GLADYS (all smiles) I said your fucking baby's gonna burn. Charlie shakes her head at the woman, not giving in. 
CHARLIE Go to hell, lady. She slaps the check down on the table and walks back toward the kitchen, passing Jeep and Bob. 
BOB What happened? 
CHARLIE Total fucking Jesus freak. Gladys begins to laugh innocently as she continues to devour her meat. Red juice drips down her chin. The flies are swarming now. How did so many get in here? Sandra and Howard are mortified at this sudden turn of events. 
Kyle, Percy, Sandra and Audrey frantically carry Howard, his neck bandaged, to the back of the Escalade. 
INT. ESCALADE - CONTINUOUS 
Howard lies in the back seat. Sandra by his head, clasping his hands in hers. Audrey by his feet. Percy rides shotgun. Kyle struggles to get the key in the ignition. The engine ROARS to life. 
EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS 
The Escalade fishtails onto the highway. 
INT. ESCALADE - CONTINUOUS 
Kyle grips the wheel.   Picking up speed. 
KYLE How far to the hospital? 
PERCY Seventy, maybe eighty miles. Kyle shoots him a look. Eighty miles?! Pedal to the floor time. Audrey leans forward from the back seat. 
AUDREY What's that on the road? Up ahead, the DARK CLOUDS Jeep saw earlier have finally closed in, descending onto the highway like a WALL. 
KYLE They're fuckin' clouds!   What the fuck do they look like? 
AUDREY Not clouds. Clouds don't buzz. She's right.    They're black... Undulating... BUZZING! 
PING!   PING!   PING! Suddenly HUNDREDS OF TINY BUGS begin to HIT the windshield -- 
SPLAT! And that's when they realize it... Those aren't clouds. 
THEY'RE FLIES! The Escalade enters the SWARM. The car is PUMMELED by insects, the windshield instantly covered in BLACK AND RED bug guts. Driving blind! The sound of FLIES SPLATTERING and BUZZING is deafening! Everyone SCREAMS as hell surrounds them... 
INT. DINER BATHROOM - SAME 
Bob is hunched over the steaming sink, pounding a can of light beer. Jeep is leaning against the wall, looking like he's about to puke or faint. 
BOB I don't understand how she was still standin' after Percy hit `er with that goddamn fryin' pan. Broke her fuckin' neck. I saw it. I swear I did. 
(BEAT) And did you see that kid's gun? The hell's he doin' with a gun like that? Bob looks over at Jeep, sees him trembling. 
BOB It's okay, Jeep.   It's okay. But for Jeep it's not okay.   He's hurting real bad inside. 
JEEP I couldn't pull the trigger. I froze. I saw what I needed to do, but I was afraid... (breaks down) She could've killed you! 
(MORE) 
JEEP (cont'd) Or Charlie...She would've killed me if it wasn't for... He can't get the words out.   Bob rests a hand on his boy's shoulder. 
BOB There's nothin' to be ashamed of, Jeep. 
(BEAT) Not everybody can play the hero. Before Jeep can respond, they hear the sound of the front 
DOOR JINGLE. 
KYLE No Twilight Zone shit if that's what you mean. Jeep slips the key into the driver's side door.     Unlocks it. 
BOB Careful. Old lady could have some kind of rabid poodle locked up in there. Jeep slowly swings the door open and that's when the smell hits them. 
KYLE Agh!   What the fuck is that? Bob covers his nose. 
BOB Jesus. Kyle opens the passenger door, looks in.      Dark, dirty.   But nothing unusual. 
KYLE Nothin' here. 
JEEP How `bout the trunk? They go around to the BACK OF THE CAR.   Jeep slips the key in. The trunk POPS open, revealing a PILE OF DEAD CATS.   ROTTING. 
MAGGOT INFESTED. Bob quickly slams the trunk closed.    The guys are reeling with disgust. Kyle's trying to blow the stench from his nose. 
KYLE Bitch's got motherfuckin' dead cats in her hoopty! What the fuck is wrong with white people?! 
BOB Least now we know where that smell was coming from. 
KYLE Yeah, it was a real motherfuckin' necessity we figured that out, man. 
JEEP (sees something up the 
ROAD) Hey... They turn to see HEADLIGHTS growing larger in the dim haze. A POLICE CRUISER careens off the highway and skids to a wild stop in front of the diner. Its ENGINE RATTLES as the dust clears around it. No movement can be seen behind its bug splattered windows. 
BOB Okay, now we're talkin'. 
JEEP Wait a minute. Check it out. It's LAPD. What's an LA cop doing way out here? Bob and Jeep look over at Kyle. 
KYLE I'm from Nevada, man. They consider the police car a moment more. See the SHATTERED PASSENGER WINDOW, the BLOOD STAINS. 
BOB Give me the shotgun. Kyle hands the shotgun over to Bob. 
INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME 
Charlie's face lights up when she sees the police car. 
CHARLIE Oh, thank God, the police! 
EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS 
The door of the POLICE CAR OPENS as Charlie races from the diner. The three men see her moving toward the car.    Jeep's face goes slack. 
JEEP Charlie, wait! The men begin to run toward her... While out of the police car steps... 
MICHAEL Charlie freezes a few feet from the car when she sees those piercing eyes already familiar to us. Michael looks at her, as if she was exactly who he expected to see. In moments Bob, Kyle and Jeep form a protective shield in front of Charlie. Bob raises the shotgun. 
BOB Take one step closer and I'll drop you right here. A long beat as Michael considers Bob.   Icy cold. 
MICHAEL That how you greet all your customers? 
BOB Mister, after what we've been through here today, you're lucky we didn't shoot you first and greet you later. Now let me see your teeth. Michael stares at him blankly. 
AUDREY Shut up, mom! 
Audrey pulls her mother back into the diner. Michael hands an MP5 SUB-MACHINE GUN to Kyle. Another one goes to Percy. Finally he places a third one in Jeep's hands, who stares down at it anxiously. 
BOB Wait. I don't think that's such a good idea. 
JEEP Dad, I can handle it. 
BOB (to Michael) He's just a kid -- 
JEEP I said, I can handle it! Michael's eyes narrow, studying Jeep. 
MICHAEL He can handle it. He doesn't have a choice. Michael pulls out twin MP5s for himself. GLOCK 9s are tucked everywhere they can go. Michael tosses clip belts to the men. Boxes of shotgun shells. The works. 
MICHAEL If you want to live, you'll do exactly as I say. He slams the trunk closed and approaches Charlie.   He cocks a Glock and hands it to her. 
MICHAEL When you fire, you keep your thumb off the slide. Don't hesitate. Don't do anything brave. There's no safety. He gives her a hard look.   She nods nervously.   Trusting him but not sure why. Michael marches into the diner. Kyle glances quickly at the others, then he bolts after Michael. Percy follows.   Then Charlie. Now it's only Jeep and his father left. 
BOB C'mon, Jeep. We gotta go! 
And Bob rushes into the diner. A moment as Jeep looks out toward the road. 
THE HEADLIGHTS ARE GROWING BRIGHTER.       CLOSER. He contemplates the sub-machine gun in his hands. 
JEEP Fuck it. And races after his father. 
CUT TO: 
A DEAD BOLT Thrown.   Locking the diner door. 
INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS 
Frantic activity. Kyle and Michael push a booth in front of the door, sealing off the entrance. Tables are turned on their sides to form makeshift shields. Window blinds are snap closed. 
THE BACK OFFICE - CONTINUOUS Jeep races in, locks the back door.       Then he pushes a desk in front of it. 
IN THE DINER - CONTINUOUS The place is transformed. Locked up tight.        The ROAR OF ENGINES outside grows ever LOUDER, CLOSER. Sandra huddles on the floor with Howard, his head in her lap. She's running her hands gently through his hair, trying to keep calm. He opens his eyes. Pale, weak from blood loss. 
HOWARD Sandra?    What's happening? 
SANDRA It's okay!     Everything's okay! Sandra closes her eyes.        Struggling to believe it. Suddenly the ELECTRICITY GOES OUT, dipping the room into 
DARKNESS. 
We hear CRIES OF ALARM.   TOTAL BLACK.   Chaos. 
BOB (V.O.) Jeep, get the flashlights! 
PERCY (V.O.) Everybody just stay still! 
KYLE (V.O.) Now that we're locked in here, what the fuck are we supposed to do? A flicker of LIGHT. And then FLASHLIGHT BEAMS CUT THROUGH THE DARKNESS...coming to rest on Michael's pale face. Michael looks up at the ceiling. 
MICHAEL Now!   Shoot now! The men let loose with FEROCIOUS FIREPOWER. 
WINDSHIELDS SHATTER!    TIRES BLOW OUT!   ENGINES EXPLODE! Vehicles swerve and COLLIDE! DARK SHAPES bolt from the burning vehicles, scattering. In the FLASH OF BATTLE we catch glimpses of them: BUSINESS 
PEOPLE. CONSTRUCTION WORKERS. EVEN AN ENTIRE HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL TEAM. All deformed by some demonic force. Many mere BALLS OF FLAME drifting through the darkness. 
MICHAEL Spread out! Don't let them get close to the windows! The DARK SHAPES converge on the diner from all directions. They move so strangely fast it seems that their feet don't actually touch the ground. From the roof it's a full-on turkey shoot as the men follow Michael's instructions and cut down everything in sight. Their faces lighting up with each FLASH. SHELL CASINGS spray from their weapons like water drops from a sprinkler. BODIES BURST and crumble to the dirt. The creatures don't seem to be afraid of dying. Their strategy appears to be in their sheer numbers. With each wave, the dark figures get ever closer to the diner. 
ON BOB firing madly.    Then...   CLICK!   CLICK!   Oh, no.   He's out of ammo. 
BOB Shells! Percy tosses him a box of shells. But Bob fumbles the catch and the box slides halfway down the sloped roof. 
BOB Fuck! With the gun still in one hand, Bob reaches frantically down for the ammo. Stretching... Further... 
A HIDEOUSLY WOUNDED MIDDLE-AGED HOUSEWIFE CATAPULTS UP FROM BELOW THE ROOFLINE! Her hair must have been in curlers before most of it BURNED AWAY. Her nightdress hangs in tatters off her body. Her jaw CLICKS RAPIDLY, as she clatters up at Bob like a GIANT INSECT. Bob tries to pull back, but he has no traction and he starts to slip down toward her. She's coming fast! Percy sees his friend in trouble. 
PERCY Bob! Bob swings the shotgun like a club -- CRACK! -- knocking the bitch clear off the roof. But the move has made his slide even faster. He drops the shotgun, trying to hold on, but he can't stop! 
BOB IS ABOUT TO HIT THE EDGE WHEN THE HORRID WOMAN POPS UP 
RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM! She doesn't even have a chance to react as Bob does something akin to a swimmer's push right off her body! WHAM! The creature goes flying back off the roof and the opposing force halts Bob's slide. 
PERCY (extending his hook) Grab my hand! Bob reaches up and clasps Percy's hook, praying that it stays on. But this chick ain't finished yet. Up she comes once more. Her razor sharp fingernails claw up the metal roof. SCREECH! 
BOB Gun! 
Percy tosses Bob a Glock. Fortunately this time Bob deftly catches it with his free hand just as the deranged woman pounces on him. 
BOB (jamming the gun in her 
MOUTH) Fuck off! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! The back of her head EXPLODES. Her body goes limp. Bob struggles to push the corpse off of him. 
BOB Pull me up! Percy extends his hook hand, helping Bob ascend to safety. 
INT. PARADISE GAS `N' GRUB - SAME 
Hiding in the shadows... listening to sounds of WAR just outside. Sandra squeezes her hands over her ears.   A few feet away, Audrey clutches a butcher's knife. Jeep's eyes darting from one window to another.   Trying to keep it together. Charlie is crouched down behind the counter, holding the handgun close to her pregnant belly. Distant EXPLOSIONS rattle the plates on the shelves. Charlie peers out from behind the counter to look at the front windows. Momentary FLASHES of intense light outline the closed blinds. Another FLASH lights up Charlie's face.    Staring. 
EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - ROOF - SAME 
Percy is swivelling left and right, firing like mad. 
PERCY Come on, motherfuckers!   Come on! Closer and closer the creatures come.   Most are eviscerated by the fire from the rooftop. 
INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME 
ON CHARLIE staring at the window.    CLOSER.   Charlie's eyes go wide as -- SMASH!   A DARK SHAPE crashes through the window.    Glass, sand and dust swirl in. Audrey and Sandra SCREAM. Charlie springs up from her hiding place, gun ready. Jeep spins around, pointing his gun, searching frantically for the intruder. It's so dark! 
JEEP Where is it?! Audrey shakes her head, tears streaming down her cheeks. She looks over at her mother. Sandra's eyes are closed. It's too much. 
AUDREY Mom!   Open your eyes! 
CHARLIE 
(RECOVERING) I'm okay. I'm fine. She glances back at Michael.       He's watching her.   Those eyes. 
CHARLIE Thanks... 
MICHAEL I told you not to do anything brave. Charlie doesn't know how to respond.      She's about to say something when -- Kyle rushes into the room.       A smile on his face. 
KYLE We got `em runnin'! Then Kyle notices the broken window, takes in the room, his excitement falling. 
KYLE Where's Howard? No one responds.   Sandra and Audrey are huddled together. Crying. Bob and Percy follow Kyle in, still shaking from the adrenaline. 
MICHAEL Someone needs to be on the roof. 
KYLE I'll go. Bob grabs Kyle's arm. 
BOB Hold on. (approaches Michael, 
DETERMINED) You better start talking. All eyes on Michael.    These people want answers.      Finally: 
MICHAEL The first time God lost faith in Man he sent a flood. The second time...he sent what you see outside. Everyone takes that in for a moment, then: 
PERCY You sayin' this is the Apocalypse...? 
MICHAEL I'm saying this is an extermination. 
(BEAT) Those things out there are vessels. The Possessed. The weakest willed are the easiest to turn. 
KYLE Possessed by what?    Demons? 
MICHAEL No...by angels. That silences the room. 
PERCY (pulls out his bible) Son, I don't know what bible you been readin', but in my version, the angels are the good guys. Michael looks squarely at Percy. 
MICHAEL That's where your book is wrong. 
SANDRA How come you know so much about them? 
MICHAEL I know because until last night, I was on their side. 
JEEP You mean you're... Michael considers Jeep, then: 
MICHAEL Not anymore... 
BOB Right and yesterday I was the fuckin' Easter Bunny. You know, fuck this. I don't even believe in God. 
MICHAEL That's fine, because He doesn't believe in you either. Bob stares at Michael, uncertain how to respond to that. 
PERCY C'mon, Bob. Have you looked outside recently? Those aren't exactly our regular customers out there. 
BOB How do we know he didn't bring them here himself? 
INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - ROOF - LATE NIGHT 
Percy and Kyle keep watch, rifles at their sides. They're wrapped up from head to toe in blankets to protect them from the cold and the flies. Percy scans the horizon.   Momentary SPECTRAL FLASHES dot the darkness. 
PERCY They're out there. Sons of bitches. I can feel `em. 
(BEAT) Damn it's cold! Percy makes the unconscious motion of rubbing his "hands" together to keep them warm. Kyle notices. Sees the dog tags. 
KYLE You were in the Army? 
PERCY Navy, two tours. But the second one didn't work out so well, so I didn't get to go back for a third. Suppose that makes me lucky in a way. Served with Bob, you know. That's how I ended up in this place. 
KYLE What was it like?    Being in a war? 
PERCY Dark.   Like this. Kyle nods. Scared. He takes out his 45.     Nervously switches it from hand to hand. 
PERCY So what's with that gun? 
KYLE What? 
PERCY Your piece. The one you killed grandma with. Don't reckon it's for huntin' buck. 
KYLE No. I uh -- keep it for protection. 
PERCY Protection from what? 
KYLE From people. Percy looks at him skeptically. 
PERCY People. 
KYLE Yeah, people who might try to give me a hard time, you know? 
PERCY Just regular people or uh... 
KYLE Yeah, well, no, not regular, regular people. 
PERCY Irregular people then. 
KYLE I'm talkin' people whose job it is to give other people a hard time. Kinda person who doesn't get enough fiber in their diet, you know what I'm sayin? 
PERCY So it's a work thing, is it? 
KYLE Exactly.    Strictly business. 
PERCY This business of yours... You like it? Kyle's eyes narrow. 
KYLE Who the fuck are you to be sweatin' me, man? I got my reasons for doin' what I do. Percy just stares at him, penetrating.     Finally: 
PERCY When I was a kid my father would sit by my bed every night before I'd go to sleep and he'd say to me, Percy, if you don't wake up tomorrow, if it turns out that today was your last day on earth, would you be proud of what you've done in this life? Cuz if you ain't, then you better start gettin' square. Kyle looks at Percy, fear in his eyes, then he turns back to the darkness...and the evil that surrounds them. 
CUT TO: 
Sandra splashes water on her face.   Stares at herself in the mirror. A living wreck. 
INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - BACK OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
Sandra steps out of the bathroom. 
VOICE (a whisper) Sandra... Sandra freezes. 
SANDRA Who's there? A beat then: 
VOICE Sandra... Sandra spins around.    Searching. 
SANDRA Howard?     Is that you? It sure sounded like Howard. 
VOICE Help me...     Please... This time, it's clear where the voice is coming from.      Sandra turns to face the BACK DOOR. A desk blocks it. Sandra ever so slowly approaches the door. 
VOICE (from behind the door) Help me. Sandra... Sandra is stricken.    What the hell is she going to do? That's when Sandra notices the TRANSOM WINDOW above the door. She climbs onto the desk and stretches up until she can see out. 
SANDRA'S POV: Howard. Her husband. Ten feet away from the door.     NAILED 
TO AN UPSIDE-DOWN CROSS. But wait. It gets worse. His skin is covered with horrible black boils. And even worse than that. Howard's boils are breathing. Sandra goes slack with horror. 
HOWARD Help me, please! Howard's torn open shirt reveals the BREATHING PUSTULES covering his body. He writhes in slow, excruciating agony. 
SANDRA Howard! Sandra scrambles down off the desk and frantically pushes it away from the door. She's reaching for the dead bolt when Audrey and Kyle appear in the doorway. 
AUDREY Mom! Kyle races to restrain Sandra. 
SANDRA Let me go!     He's alive! 
She struggles against him, throwing a wild elbow that tags Kyle in the face. Down he goes. Sandra is about to open the door when Audrey pounces on her. 
INT. PARADISE GAS `N' GRUB - SAME 
The SHOUTING from the back office awakens the rest of the sleepers. Percy springs up. Charlie is shaking Jeep. 
EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - ROOF - SAME 
The ROAR OF WIND ripping off the plain is all that can be heard. ON BOB as his head drops down with drunken fatigue. Sleep. 
RISING OVER HIM TO SEE... Howard nailed to the upside-down cross below. 
INT. PARADISE GAS `N' GRUB - BACK OFFICE - SAME 
Sandra and Audrey are locked in battle. Sandra slaps Audrey hard. Audrey stumbles over Kyle and hits the floor. Percy appears in the doorway. Now is her last chance. Sandra whips open the back door and that's when the world hits SLOW MOTION. Howard is there.    A few feet away.   Alive. Sandra races toward him.    Just behind her comes Percy. 
SANDRA Howard! And that's when the speed ACCELERATES TO NORMAL -- -- and the boils covering Howard's body explode -- spraying streams of dark fluid toward Sandra -- -- just at the moment Percy spins around her, shielding her from the spray, which hits him in the back. But he's not stopping. Percy pushes Sandra back into the diner, the door SLAMMING closed behind them. Percy releases Sandra, letting her stumble hysterically into the room. Kyle and Jeep grab her, forcing her to the ground. But she's not fighting anymore. Charlie turns to look at Percy who is still standing with his back to the door, breathing heavily. 
CHARLIE Percy? He takes a step forward, then falls to ground. The entire back side of his body is gone.      Burned away. 
CUT TO: 
Charlie stands at the sink, cigarette to her lips, water running, stealing a private moment. She takes a deep drag, feels the smoke filling her lungs, defiant. Then she catches a look at herself in the mirror, runs her hand along the curvature of her belly. Tears well up in her eyes, fear and anger overtaking her. She stamps out the cigarette in a fit of frustration. 
INT. DINER - A SHORT WHILE LATER 
It's quiet. DRIFTING past sleeping figures to find Charlie, wide-awake, sitting at a booth, lost in thought. 
JEEP (O.S.) Guess it's your turn not to sleep. Charlie looks up to see Jeep sit down across from her. 
CHARLIE Hey... Jeep sees the strain on her face. 
JEEP You okay? 
CHARLIE You mean besides the fact that I just found out that I'm the mother of the Messiah? Jeep smiles, nods. 
CHARLIE Crazy thing is...I didn't want this baby. I even went down to the clinic, you know that? (off Jeep's reaction:) I remember sitting there in the waiting room, absolutely sure I was doin' the right thing...And that's when the feeling started. Like I was falling into the deepest, darkest hole imaginable. I couldn't breathe, I couldn't speak. I kept thinking this must be what death is like. And when finally they called my name, I ran. 
(BEAT) For a while after that I tried pretending that it was just cold feet, that I could go back if I wanted to, that I could decide to end it like I'd planned. Then I'd start to have that feeling again and I knew I didn't have a choice. Somehow this had already been decided. And it made me hate this thing that's been growing inside me. A long beat, as Jeep considers her, then: 
JEEP You shouldn't say things like that, Charlie. It isn't right. You'll get through this. I know you will. She turns to him, the bitterness overtaking her: 
CHARLIE How come you have so much faith in me, Jeep? God knows I've never given you or anybody else a reason to. Or is it that you just can't find any other hard-luck case to follow around? Jeep's face hardens.   He gets up.   Hurt.   Frustrated. 
JEEP You know, you're not the only who's suffered, okay? Let me know when you stop feeling sorry for yourself. And with that, Jeep walks away, leaving Charlie to stare after him, disturbed and surprised by his response. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - ROOF - LATE AFTERNOON 
Sand and wind.    The INVISIBLE SUN is sinking. Kyle and Audrey are bundled together on the roof, keeping watch. Kyle is showing her how to hold the MP5. 
KYLE ...Then you just flip this -- Audrey flips the safety. 
AUDREY Yeah, I got it. All the way down. Two clicks. She points the gun out into the haze like she's been holding one all her life. Off Kyle's surprised look: 
AUDREY Dated this guy last summer. A marine. Had a thing for guns. Parents hated him. 
KYLE I bet they did. After a moment, Audrey switches the safety back on.   Hands the gun over to Kyle. Audrey stares into the red nothingness surrounding them. Her expression growing distant. She seems to have aged years overnight. 
AUDREY My parents hate everything I do. That's why we were moving. 
KYLE Yeah? 
AUDREY They thought a more "wholesome" environment would help me "change my ways." So fucked up. Only reason they care at all is cuz they don't want to be embarrassed in front of their friends at the country club. Kyle considers her thoughtfully. 
KYLE The only time my old man ever paid attention to me was when I was doing somethin' bad. So you know what I did? 
AUDREY What? 
KYLE I got really good at being bad. She smiles at this confession.    Can obviously relate.   He wipes a tear from her cheek. She leans in.   Kisses him.   Passionately.   Desperately. His hands trace over her body. She claws at him. Her passion growing out of control. She's practically devouring him. Kyle can barely keep up. It's like something else beyond sensual need has taken over. She moves down his chest.     Further.   Kyle leans his head back. Further. Just then the SPOT LIGHTS that illuminate the roof sign come to life.   The young couple stops to look up at the brilliant red word "Paradise" illuminated above them. Down below, the gas pumps LIGHT UP.      The station's FLUORESCENTS flicker on. 
INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB - SAME 
REACHES THE CEILING AND...STOPS. 
BOB What the fuck? 
SCREECH!   THE BLOODY BOY SPRINGS OFF A TABLE BEHIND THEM AND 
LANDS ON BOB'S BACK. Bob flails around trying to pull the boy's small, but deadly strong arms away from his neck. 
JEEP Dad! Jeep can't get a clear shot.       Bob's gasping for air. Michael grabs the boy and fiercely rips him off of Bob's back. He swings the boy around like a living shot put. 
MICHAEL Get ready! Jeep and Bob whip up their guns as Michael throws the wicked creature into the air. Sandra's vacant face flickers in the light as the SOUND OF GUNFIRE AND INHUMAN SCREAMING fill the diner. And then in moments...      All is QUIET. BEHIND THE COUNTER, Audrey helps Charlie to her feet.       She WINCES. Doubles over, clutching her stomach. 
CHARLIE Oh, no! Michael lowers his flashlight.      CLEAR FLUID runs down Charlie's legs. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.   PARADISE GAS `N' GRUB - LATE NIGHT 
Inky darkness.   A flickering light emanates from within the diner. TITLE:   "December 25th - 3:33am" The sound of CHARLIE'S SCREAM, carries us to: 
INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - LATE NIGHT 
Charlie, drenched in sweat is writhing on the ground with Michael holding down her arms and Audrey kneeling between her legs. Pots of steaming water surround them. 
AUDREY What am I supposed to do? Just `cause I'm a girl doesn't mean I automatically know how to do this! 
MICHAEL Just do as I say. 
AUDREY Yeah, but, how do you know how to do this?! 
EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - ROOF - SAME 
Bob and Jeep keep watch. The SPECTRAL LIGHTS in the distance seem to be growing larger -- closer. Charlie's SCREAMING rises up from below. 
BOB What a way to bring a child into the world. (looks over at Jeep) She ever tell you his name? 
JEEP She's never said. I just assumed it was Joe Danvers. You know how she's always had a thing for bad boys. Bob hears the spite in Jeep's voice. 
BOB Jeep, sooner or later she'll realize you're the best thing that's ever happened to her. 
JEEP I thought you said I should move on? 
BOB Can't a father be wrong sometimes? Jeep considers Bob with a smile, then comes the sound... A DEEP, LONG, BODY RUMBLING TONE rising up off the plain, as if emanating from the largest HORN ever constructed. 
JEEP What was that...? The SPECTRAL LIGHTS dot the landscape now with untold numbers. 
INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS 
Michael reacts to the sound. An urgency comes over him. Audrey arrives with more steaming water. 
AUDREY What is that?! 
(BEAT) Mama? If Sandra hears her daughter, it doesn't show in her face. Tears well up in Audrey's eyes as she moves away from her mother. But we HOLD here and... DRIFT DOWN BEHIND THE CHAIR TO REVEAL Sandra's hands are loosening the bonds. BLOOD TRICKLES from where the rope's cut through her skin. 
EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME 
DRIFTING THROUGH the dark shapes as the BABY'S CRIES reverberate up and down the ranks. They begin to look about frantically, agitated by the sound. Some even begin to back away from the diner. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. DESERT - CONTINUOUS 
Off in the distance, the diner is but a dim flickering light above the plain. It could almost be mistaken for a stable in a desert town a long time ago. THREE STARS burn bright and low in the black sky. All around us the DARK CREATURES are cowering from sound of the CRYING INFANT whose wails seem to grow even LOUDER the further away from the diner we get. 
HIGH ABOVE THE TRUCK STOP In the darkness below we see the lights of the legions of creatures dot the landscape and at the center of it all, the truck stop. The sound of WINGS BEATING AGAINST THE WIND. 
AND WE'RE DRIFTING DOWN TOWARD THE DINER ENTRANCE.   LIKE A 
BIRD CIRCLING ITS PREY. 
INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME 
Jeep and Bob enter the diner to see Michael helping Charlie to her feet, while Audrey continues to pace, the bundle of bloody blankets cradled in her arms. 
JEEP Something's happening.    They're moving away. 
MICHAEL The Possessed can't come near the child, so He sent someone that can. Someone like me. 
BOB Who? 
MICHAEL Gabriel. My lieutenant.      He's come to do what I wouldn't. ON JEEP as the realization hits him. 
JEEP Your orders... Michael looks at Jeep. 
JEEP You were the one who was supposed to kill the baby? That was the order you didn't obey. Michael nods grimly.    Charlie looks urgently at Michael. 
CHARLIE What's he talking about? The baby CRIES LOUDER. 
CHARLIE Michael, what the hell's he talking about?! 
MICHAEL There was never meant to be a Second Coming. But we've just changed that. The child lives. The future is unwritten. There's still hope. Charlie, shaken by this revelation, reaches out to Audrey. 
CHARLIE Audrey...? Audrey moves to hand over the baby to Charlie... 
...AND THAT'S WHEN SANDRA SPRINGS OUT OF HER CHAIR AND 
SNATCHES THE BABY FROM AUDREY'S ARMS! Sandra backs away from them, moving toward the front door. Hers is the face of madness. 
SANDRA Stay away from me!    Don't come any closer! 
AUDREY Mom! 
BOB Don't do it, lady! 
CHARLIE What is it? A beat, as Jeep remembers Michael's parting words... 
JEEP The instructions... 
INT. PARADISE GAS `N' GRUB - SAME 
Gabriel watches as the last of the writing FADES from Michael's body when he hears a faint CLICKING sound from somewhere in the diner. Gabriel moves gracefully through the destroyed diner, toward the source of the CLICKING. He steps behind the counter and finds Bob lying in a massive pool of blood. It takes the creature a moment to realize that the CLICKING sound is coming from Bob's SILVER ZIPPO. Bob is focusing every last ounce of life in his body to lighting that lighter. CLICK... CLICK... CLICK... Bob looks at Gabriel. 
BOB Sorry...   We're closed. And with one last brush of his thumb, Bob's trusty ZIPPO 
IGNITES. Gabriel's eyes go wide as the TINY FLAME DANCES in front of the stove's broken gas line. Gabriel spins and runs like hell as the gas explodes. 
A STREAM OF FIRE ENGULFS HIM AS HIS WINGS UNFOLD AND HE LEAPS 
INTO AWESOME FIERY FLIGHT. 
INT. POLICE CRUISER - DRIVING - CONTINUOUS 
The MASSIVE EXPLOSION rocks the slow moving vehicle. In the rearview mirror, Jeep sees the CLOUD OF FIRE MUSHROOMING UP in the sky behind them. It's eerily magnificent. 
CHARLIE The swarm, it's fading! Jeep looks back to the road as, sure enough, the FLY SWARM suddenly dissipates all around them, revealing a CLEAR VIEW of the highway ahead. Jeep knows at what price this good fortune has come. 
JEEP Thank you... 
AND THAT'S WHEN THE WORD "PARADISE" CRASHES DOWN LIKE A BALL 
OF FIRE ONTO THE ROAD DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THEM! 
JEEP Oh, shit! 
EXT. HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS 
The cruiser PUNCHES through the burning "Paradise" sign, smashing it into fiery pieces! The cruiser charges on down the endless highway, burning bits of sign swirling in its wake. 
INT. POLICE CRUISER - DRIVING - CONTINUOUS 
From the back seat, Audrey watches the fire recede into the distance. 
AUDREY I can't believe it.   Is it really over...? Up front Jeep stares out at the dark road ahead. 
JEEP No...It's just starting... 
EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME 
Burning wreckage everywhere. DRIFTING THROUGH IT until we settle on the SPIKE-SCEPTER stuck firmly in the ground. Flames ring the handle. 
EXT. HIGHWAY - SAME 
The cruiser blazes down the highway. 
INT. POLICE CRUISER - DRIVING - SAME 
AUDREY (O.S.) Get off her, you fucking asshole! Audrey leaps onto Gabriel, pulling him away from Charlie just in time. He flails wildly about but this young girl rides him like one helluva a cowboy. 
AUDREY Do it, Jeep! Do it now! 
JEEP SLAMS ON THE BREAKS, SENDING GABRIEL AND AUDREY SHOOTING 
FORWARD THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD LIKE A BULLET. The intertwined bodies of Gabriel and Audrey hit the road with a sickening crunch and ROLL INTO A BALL OF FIRE. 
EXT. RED ROCK PARK - CONTINUOUS 
The Cruiser spins out of control, swerving off the road and careening into a large rock formation. This ride is over. 
INT. POLICE CRUISER - CONTINUOUS 
Jeep's side of the car is crushed.   Blood is running down his forehead. Charlie crawls up from the floor. 
CHARLIE C'mon, Jeep! 
He tries to focus on her. 
CHARLIE Jeep! She kicks open her door and begins pulling him out. 
JEEP The baby? 
CHARLIE Alive. 
JEEP And what about... 
CHARLIE Nothing could have survived that. 
JEEP 
(ANGUISHED) Audrey... 
CHARLIE She saved us, Jeep. Audrey saved us. Now c'mon, we gotta go! Charlie, the baby bundled in her hands, leads Jeep away from the demolished Cruiser. 
EXT. RED ROCK RIDGE - PRE-DAWN 
Jeep and Charlie, battered and bruised, struggle to make the long climb up the ridge. Charlie looks up. STARS completely fill the pre-dawn sky.   Breathtaking. 
CHARLIE How can this happen? 
JEEP What? 
CHARLIE How can this happen in a world so beautiful? Jeep follows her gaze to the sky. Endless stars.    Confounding. Jeep shifts his eyes to the TOP OF THE RIDGE just ahead. 
JEEP C'mon, we're almost there. They are only a few steps from the EDGE OF THE RIDGE when -- 
GABRIEL ROCKETS UP IN FRONT OF THEM! Charlie screams! Jeep pushes her and the baby out of the way just as Gabriel comes down hard in front of them, kicking up a cloud of dust. Gabriel's mechanical wings haltingly retract. The crash has done some serious damage. Much of his skin has burned away. Chunks of his armor and flesh are missing as well, including a large part of his head, revealing that under his human visage is a NIGHTMARISH CREATURE. Gabriel charges at Jeep fast. Jeep whips up his Glock, BLAM! Gabriel takes the bullet, then slaps the gun out of Jeep's hand. Jeep throws a wild punch, connects with Gabriel's chin, rocking him back. More annoyed than surprised, Gabriel knocks Jeep savagely to the ground. Jeep struggles quickly to his feet, comes right back at Gabriel swinging. But Gabriel simply knocks him to the dirt again. Jeep slowly gets up once more, bleeding, hurt.   Raises his fists. This kid will simply not give up. Jeep moves in again, swinging hard, but Gabriel blocks it, shoots out a hand and grabs Jeep by throat, lifting him clear off the ground. 
GABRIEL So brave. So pointless. You should have worried more about saving yourself. Jeep's feet dangle. His eyes bulge out. He claws at Gabriel's iron-fast grip, but there's no hope. Charlie watches in horror.

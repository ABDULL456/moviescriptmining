EYES. Expressive, alive. Human? No. They belong to a FEMALE CHIMPANZEE: BRIGHT EYES. 
EXT. GROVE OF TREES -- DAY 
She sits in a tree with ALPHA, her mate - large and muscular, a PROMINENT WHITE BIRTHMARK ACROSS HIS SHOULDER, LIKE A 
SHOOTING STAR. Around them, under the TREE CANOPY, a COMMUNITY OF CHIMPANZEES naps, eats, plays. 
EXT. WEST AFRICAN JUNGLE - DAY 
A DOZEN POACHERS on horseback slog through the jungle. They're working towards the GROVE, visible in the distance. As they near it, the LEADER points, sending the MEN moving quietly, NETS and RIFLES ready. 
EXT. CANOPY - DAY 
Alpha sits up, sensing something. BIRDS take sudden flight. He stands on the branch and YELLS OUT A WARNING. FEAR ignites the community - but too late. POACHERS BURST INTO THE CLEARING, horses' hooves kicking up dirt. CHIMPS SCATTER. Bright Eyes wants to stay by Alpha's side, but he bares his teeth and sends her off. Then he drops, landing firmly on the clearing floor. All around him, POACHERS pursue terrified apes, nets swinging. MALE CHIMPANZEES jump up and down, SHOUTING AND SCREECHING - an aggressive show. A futile attempt to protect the tribe. Alpha zeroes in on a POACHER attempting to scoop up a YOUNG CHIMP. He streaks across the clearing, KNOCKS THE POACHER 
FROM HIS MOUNT. Alpha POUNDS his CHEST, letting out a BATTLE CRY -- trying to rally a counter-attack. But the other chimps pay no heed. There's no organization to the defense. It's chaos. SHOTS RING OUT. The Chimps mauling the Poacher drop, one by one. Others take off. 
Alpha spots Bright Eyes across the clearing, dragged off in a net. He RUSHES to save her, leaps in the air... 
A SHOT RINGS OUT. 
BRIGHT EYES WATCHES - HORRIFIED - AS ALPHA CRUMPLES IN THE 
AIR AND FALLS TO THE GROUND. LIKE A STONE. 
FADE TO WHITE TWO FACES wearing SURGICAL MASKS lean in and peer down at us. FRANKLIN - broken horn-rimmed glasses - and CAROLINE - curly red hair under a sterile cap. 
CAROLINE Nanotherapy, beta version: Tuesday, March 10, 2011. Female Test subject Number four. Franklin reaches for us, smiles... 
FRANKLIN Here we go, Bright eyes. A MIST fogs our view for a moment. 
CAROLINE Not too much. She needs to be calm, but alert. 
VOICE THROUGH INTERCOM Go ahead - send her through. A LOUD HUM and we start moving, sliding into a tunnel a tubular CT SCAN - with a MIRROR on the top. Now WE SEE OUR FACE REFLECTED: A FEMALE APE IN A GAS MASK. Bright Eyes. 
INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - SAME 
WILL RODMAN - late twenties, lab coat over a T-shirt and jeans - stands at the glass, watching the terrified chimpanzee slide into the machine. The focus in his eyes belies the casual dress. 
WILL Start the scan. A TECHIE sits at a computer screen beside Will. 
TECHIE Scanning. 
INT. WHITE ROOM -- DAY 
Another tech, DONNIE - skinny, tattooed - controls the machine, sending the restrained animal into the scanner. Caroline moves to an IV STAND beside the scan. The bag's full of a PHOSPHORESCENT GREEN LIQUID. 
DONNIE Stuff looks like Kool-aid. 
CAROLINE Go ahead, I'm sure you could use it. 
(OPENING VALVE) Starting the therapy... 
INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - SAME 
Will looks at a monitor showing the BRAIN SCAN OF THE CHIMP. The image starts to shake. Concerned, he looks to the other room - where he can see the CHIMP'S LEGS SHAKING IN THEIR 
RESTRAINTS. 
EXT. GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - DUSK (AERIAL) 
Will drives over the majestic Golden Gate Bridge. 
EXT. WILL'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Will pulls up in front of his house. Set in a hillside neighborhood, it's neat, nondescript. The home of a bachelor who hasn't given it much thought. As Will pulls into the driveway, WE HEAR C SHARP PLAYED OVER 
AND OVER ON A PIANO. 
INT. WILL'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
WALTER RODMAN, 60, sits at the piano dressed in a robe, stabbing at the key with his finger. Will enters, his posture almost visually changing with the emotional weight of this man, his father. 
WILL Hey Dad. Walter looks up, whispers... 
WALTER John... is that you? 
WILL It's me. Will. 
WALTER As thou dost, Anthony. (staring at the keys) .he hears no music. No music... 
VOICE (heavy Russian accent) He's been doing that all day. A Home Aide enters, grabs her coat. This is IRENA. 
IRENA He found an old book of his. She pulls a worn paperback of Julius Caesar from Walter's pocket. He snatches it from her, puts it back. 
IRENA (CONT'D) (shrugging on coat) I had no idea you liked Shakespeare so much, Mr. Walter. 
WILL My mother was the one. She liked Shakespeare... 
IRENA 
(KISSES HIM) Good night, Walter, hone-ee. She heads out. Will gently takes his father's arm. 
I WILL Come on, Dad. 
INT. WALTER'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Will helps his father change into pajamas. 
WILL Remember I told you we were using Basic Fibroblast Growth Factors on the apes? Well the therapy seems to be working. We've seen definite signs of adult brain neurogenesis. Walter holds up his arms for Will to slide on the pajama top. 
WILL (CONT'D) Board of Directors is coming in a couple weeks to talk about Phase 2 - that's clinical trials. Walter gives no hint he's even listening, much less understanding what Will's saying. 
WILL (CONT'D) Human trials, Dad. Soon. 
WALTER I rather tell that what is to be feared than what I fear: for always... I am Caesar... There's no way to reach him tonight. Still Will tries.. 
WILL I'm going to make you better - I swear it. His father looks at him. A moment of recognition? 
WALTER John... ? 
WILL 
(DISAPPOINTED) No, Dad, it's me. Will. Will helps the old man under the bedcovers. 
WILL (CONT'D) John's gone. He moves to the door, pausing to take in the diplomas on the walls - Walter's name on all of them. (Physics, Astronomy.) 
Will looks at his father lying there on his back, staring up at the ceiling. The once brilliant man now slipping away. 
INT. WILL'S STUDY - LATE NIGHT 
It's late. Signs of a half-eaten frozen dinner on the desk beside numerous papers, charts, and Will's computer. He looks exhausted, gulps from a cup of coffee as he works. 
INT. PRIMATE LAB - DAY 
Franklin moves from cage to cage, greeting the apes. 
FRANKLIN Good morning, Felix. Bam Bam. Monty. Hey - what's the matter, don't like my cooking? 
SUPER: TWO WEEKS LATER He pauses in front of Bright Eyes, huddled at the back of her cage. 
INT. LAB - DAY 
DONNIE She's breaking my hand! 
CAROLINE Let go, Bright Eyes! You're hurting him! She tries to help pull Donnie away. 
CAROLINE (CONT'D) Let go! In the next room Franklin's having troubles of his own. 
LUCKY - RILED UP FROM THE COMMOTION IN BRIGHT EYES' CAGE AND 
THE SCREAMING FROM THE OTHER CHIMPS - BREAKS AWAY. 
HE CRASHES OUT OF THE LAB, DRAGGING HIS LEASH. 
FRANKLIN Lucky no! Stop! 
(TO CAROLINE) Hit the alarm! Caroline lunges to an ALARM BUTTON and pounds it. 
DONNIE'S SCREAMS BECOME OTHERWORLDLY AS WE GO TO... 
INT. LAB SECURITY ROOM - SAME 
LOUD BEEPING as two GUARDS look to a BLACK AND WHITE SCREEN of a corridor. They see Lucky dragging his leash as he scampers - unattended - down the hall. 
GUARD #1 Uh oh. Guard #2 turns to another screen - where DONNIE IS VISIBLE IN 
SILENT AGONY, PUSHED UP AGAINST THE CAGE, CAROLINE TRYING TO 
GET HIM FREE. 
GUARD #2 Hey, Len...? Bright eyes is pulling Donnie's arm right from its socket... Donnie falls to the floor at Caroline's feet... 
EXT. GEN-SYS GROUNDS - DAY 
Lucky BURSTS from the lab building and runs across the grounds. He leaps over a car, then heads for the nearest building. 
INT. BOARDROOM - DAY 
The room is still thrumming with the excitement of Will's pronouncement. 
BOARD MEMBER What about the safety of the virus? 
WILL Perfectly safe. We're using the most stable - A COMMOTION outside. Someone SCREAMS. Then a BLACK BLUR as LUCKY CRASHES THROUGH THE GLASS WINDOW. 
WILL (CONT'D) 
NO! Lucky turns on Will with a growl, lurching toward him and pinning him to the wall. It happens fast. The chimpanzee opens his powerful jaw, exposing DEADLY 
INCISORS... â¢ BAM! BAM! BAM! Security Guard #1 SHOOTS LUCKY IN THE BACK. The chimp turns, leaps for the Guard - who FIRES again. 
Will watches as the chimp - and all of Will's dreams - collapses on the boardroom table. 
EXT. GEN-SYS GROUNDS - NIGHT 
Rain and fog. An AMBULANCE pulls out, past POLICE CRUISERS and two CDC (CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL) VANS. Will - face cut, clothing torn - finishes with a DETECTIVE and walks through the chaotic aftermath. He watches Caroline walk alongside a stretcher carrying Donnie, his shoulder packed in ice. He spots Jacobs, who looks wrecked. He hurries over to him. 
WILL Are they gone? 
JACOBS Long gone. Will knows the answer, but has to ask anyway. 
WILL Did they say anything before they left? I mean, about Phase 2. 
JACOBS Look around you, for Christ sakes. We'll be lucky if we don't go to jail. Will's gutted - devastated. 
WILL But we're so close. 
JACOBS You think you're the only one who's got something at stake here? I've got my own skin in this game! 
WILL What happened had nothing to do with the 112. (desperate to clarify) Take an already aggressive animal, make it smarter - you're going to get a potentially dangerous 
SITUATION - 
FRANKLIN Bright Eyes - the mother. That's why she wouldn't let anyone into her cage. Will looks down at the helpless baby. 
WILL I'm sorry, Franklin - I'm sorry - but there's nothing I can do here. He's got to be put down like the others. 
FRANKLIN Tell you what, Doc. (producing a syringe) I'm done for the day. So you be my guest. Franklin hands the LONG NEEDLE to Will. It's quiet. Will can hear the baby's WHEEZY breath. He enters the cage kneels beside it, regards his tiny body, his little hands. Will readies the needle, brings it close to the chimp's belly... but there's no way he can go through with this. Angrily Will tosses the needle aside. Turns to Franklin, who watches from outside the cage. 
WILL Two days. Then you have to figure it out. 
INT. WALMART - NIGHT 
A BOX OF DIAPERS pulled from the shelf and tossed into a cart. Will moves down the aisle in a daze, the baby chimp - covered in a blanket - plastered to his chest. He stops at the powdered formulas, overwhelmed by the array of choices. 
INT. WALMART CHECK OUT - NIGHT 
A TEEN rings up the baby goods. 
TEEN CASHIER Hey man. Congratulations. 
WILL Huh? 
(REALIZING) Oh. Thanks. 
EXT. WILL'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Will pulls up in his truck. 
EXT. FRONT DOOR - NIGHT 
Will's coat is pulled forward to shield the baby at his chest. He barely has the key in the lock when Irena opens the door. 
IRENA It's Friday night. I had a date. 
WILL I'm sorry - there was - She doesn't wait to hear his excuse, just moves down the walk, her footfalls pointed and angry. He pauses there. Apparently no end to this bad day. 
INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT 
Will dumps the baby goods on the counter, heads for the refrigerator. The infant's still plastered to his chest. He opens the fridge, grabs a crisper drawer, empties its contents in the sink. Then Will REACHES INTO HIS JACKET POCKET AND TAKES OUT THE 
VIAL OF 112. CAREFULLY HE PLACES IT INTO THE DRAWER AND 
ROLLS THE DRAWER BACK IN THE FRIDGE. 
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Will sleeps the deep sleep of exhaustion. A HIGH PITCHED WAIL comes from another part of the house. Will sits up, remembering. 
INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - NIGHT 
Will enters, half asleep, turns on the light. The baby chimp lies in a cardboard box on the floor and he's obviously sick, making UNNATURAL WHEEZING NOISES. 
Will stares down at the little creature, trying to decide what to do. 
INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT 
Will turns on the HOT WATER. SHUTS the door. Holding the limp, feeble chimp in his arms, he puts down the toilet seat and sits. 
WILL It's okay. It's going to be okay. Awkwardly, he even rocks back and forth a little bit. Will looks down at the chimp, struggling for breath. The room fills with STEAM. 
CUT TO: A LARGE MALE CHIMPANZEE IN THE WILD. He stands at the top of a tree, an alpha male, eyeing the CHIMPS around him. In a sudden BURST of movement, the CHIMPANZEE TAKES OFF, FLYING FROM BRANCH TO BRANCH with tremendous force, a FREIGHT 
TRAIN OF THREAT, POWER AND VIOLENCE. Teeth bared in a terrifying display, the ape easily intimidates all the chimps around him. 
REVEAL THAT THE CHIMP IMAGES ARE YOU-TUBE AND WILL'S WATCHING 
THEM ON HIS LAPTOP. Abruptly he closes it. Looks down at the infant, so peaceful in his arms. 
SUPER: "TWO YEARS LATER" SOUND of a TOILET FLUSH. 
INT. HOUSE - DAY 
The chimp - looking like a toddler - walks out of the bathroom, hiking up a pair of shorts. WE FOLLOW HIM THROUGH THE HOUSE as he zig zags up and over furniture. The house looks warmer, cluttered, more lived-in. The chimp arrives at a hallway, where he leaps into the air and grabs hold of a CORD that hangs from the ceiling. As his weight pulls it down, there's a SQUEAK and a FOLD DOWN LADDER opens from above. WE FOLLOW HIM up the ladder into... 
STEWART When I was examining his eyes, I noticed a strange green pigmentation. 
WILL Green? His heart starts to pound. 
STEWART Green. Never.seen it before. She hands Will an OTOSCOPE. 
STEWART (CONT'D) Take a look. Will peers through the magnification - and sure enough, finds 
FLECKS OF BRIGHT GREEN PIGMENTATION - JUST LIKE THE 112. 
STEWART (CONT'D) It's faint, can you pick it up? He sits down in the nearest chair - stunned. She eyes him. 
STEWART (CONT'D) You alright? Want a glass of water? 
WILL No thanks. 
(EMBARRASSED) Sure, that would be good. She gets him one. Concerned, Caesar comes over. 
WILL (CONT'D) Forgot to eat today. Not a big deal. 
Stewart hands him the glass. He downs it. 
WILL (CONT'D) 
(TO CAESAR) I'm fine. Stewart puts her hand to the side of his neck. Feels good. 
STEWART Carotid pulse is running a little fast. 
WILL For a human or a chimpanzee? First time he's seen her smile. It lights up her face. 
STEWART Gotta remember to eat. 
INT. MOVING CAR - DAY 
Will drives Caesar, both of them licking soft-serve ice cream cones. He pulls up outside a store: "SMART CHILD" 
EDUCATIONAL TESTING TOYS. 
WILL (O.S.) You have to move the whole tower to another peg, one block at a time. 
INT. KITCHEN - DAY 
Walter's parked in front of the TV, not watching it. Caesar sits at the table looking at a flat board with three wooden poles. There are four colored blocks threaded on the first pole, stacked biggest to smallest, making a 'tower'. Irena stands next to Will, watching Caesar. There's also a CAMCORDER on a tripod. 
WILL Here's the hard part: you can't put a larger block on top of a smaller one. Caesar studies the puzzle. 
WILL (CONT'D) Understand? 
Caesar's already started. He methodically begins moving blocks from one pole to another, pausing, backtracking, getting it right, never a bigger one on top of a smaller... Will watches, increasingly amazed, as he re-creates the tower on a different pole. It's easy for him. Finished, Caesar looks up at him. Will fumbles in his pocket, HANDS CAESAR SOME M&MS. 
WILL (CONT'D) 
(STUNNED) He did it in fifteen moves. 
IRENA What's the best score? 
WILL Fifteen. Will looks over at Walter, who's staring at the wall. 
IRENA 
(AMAZED) I wonder where he gets such talent? 
WILL (eyes on Walter) It was passed down from his mother. 
INT. WILL'S STUDY - NIGHT 
Will uploads the MPEG video of Caesar doing the puzzle and prepares to record an AUDIO ATTACHMENT. 
WILL (into computer mic) At age two Caesar appears to exceed his mother's aptitude. He signs over three hundred words. He exhibits no visible side effects from the therapy... 
INT. GARAGE - NIGHT 
TODD AND FRIEND Monkey in the middle, monkey in the middle... Caesar's having fun, unaware that the game has become keep- away from him. Until he NOTICES ALICE'S EXPRESSION - SHE 
FEELS SORRY FOR HIM. 
THEN, IN A STOMACH-LURCHING MOMENT CAESAR REALIZES WHAT'S 
GOING ON: HE'S THE BUTT OF A JOKE. They're making fun of him. "MONKEY", "MONKEY", "MONKEY"... The chanted words ring in Caesar's ears. He drops his arms and walks over to Todd, stepping close, hot rage escaping from his nostrils. Todd tries to laugh it off, but the fear's plain on his face. Alice runs inside. 
EXT. STREET - DAY 
Will and Walter search down the street. Then they hear it: â¢ HUNSIKER'S YELL. Will runs for the neighbor's house. 
EXT. HUNSIKER BACK YARD - DAY 
Hunsiker approaches Caesar with a raised bat. The terrified chimp backs toward his fence. 
HUNSIKER Hah! Hah - Will JUMPS INTO THE YARD AND PUTS HIMSELF BETWEEN HUNSIKER AND CAESAR. Caesar cowers behind him. 
WILL Hold on - it's okay - he's harmless! 
HUNSIKER Your monkey came onto my property! Threatened my kids! By now Caesar has climbed into Will's arms, burying his head in. his neck. Will backs toward the gate. 
WILL It won't happen again... 
HUNSIKER Damn right it won't happen again! I'll press charges if it does! Will holds Caesar close and hurries home. 
INT. STEWART'S OFFICE - DAY 
STEWART What does he do for fun? Will's brought Caesar in for a check-up. He's a little thrown by the question. 
WILL Well we've got puzzles, games, a swing set... 
STEWART My guess is he needs more. More exercise, more space. 
WILL We'll work on that. Stewart continues examining Caesar. Will watches her listen to his heart. Closing her eyes for a moment, listening. 
He gets up his nerve. 
WILL (CONT'D) What about you? 
(BEAT) What do you do for fun? She opens her eyes, looks at him. He thinks she doesn't understand the question. 
WILL (CONT'D) How about dinner and a movie? Stewart pulls the stethoscope from her ears. 
STEWART I'm sorry, did you say something? He starts to try again - but the moment's gone. 
WILL No - nothing. Caesar meets Will's eyes, obviously disappointed. Stewart lingers a moment, certain she's missed something - but Will doesn't say more. 
EXT. MUIR WOODS, ESTABLISHING - DAY 
From high above, WE PASS OVER the Golden Gate Bridge, the link between the bustling city and a huge, green FOREST. 
INT. MOVING CAR - DAY 
Caesar - driving with Walter and Will -- looks out the window, extremely excited. 
EXT. PARKING LOT, MUIR WOODS - DAY 
As Caesar scrambles out of the truck, WILL HOOKS A HARNESS TO HIS COLLAR and helps Walter from the car. The chimp looks around at the SOARING TREES. What is this place? The three of them head into the forest, Caesar tugging at the leash. 
WALTER Take him off the leash. 
Â¢ WILL There's a place up ahead. 
EXT. PARK/CLEARING - DAY 
They've walked deep into the park. No people here. Will kneels next to Caesar. 
WILL Don't go far. Stay where I can see you. Will takes OFF CAESAR'S HARNESS. The chimpanzee runs, begins flying from tree to tree. Will watches, nervous. But it's gratifying to see Caesar so happy. The CHIMP DISAPPEARS around a corner. A moment passes, then another. The men follow... and discover CAESAR STANDING IN A 
GROVE OF TREES. 
Caesar stands in front of a FULL LENGTH MIRROR, shirtless. He stands up straight, like a human. Tries to imitate their posture, their gait. 
BUT FROM THE MIRROR A CHIMPANZEE STARES BACK AT HIM. A 
CHIMPANZEE WITH GREEN EYES. 
THERE'S A PROMINENT WHITE BIRTHMARK ON HIS SHOULDER - JUST 
LIKE ALPHA'S. He runs two fingers down the length of it. 
INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT 
Caesar, Walter and Will sit at the dinner table. There's tension here, but we can't place it yet. Then WE SEE that WALTER IS STRUGGLING TO EAT BECAUSE HE'S USING THE WRONG END OF THE SPOON. He clutches the utensil, staring at it. 
WILL Turn it around, Dad. You're using the wrong end. Walter looks at Will, uncomprehending. With care and compassion, Caesar reaches over and helps the old man, adjusting the spoon. Will watches. Heartbroken. 
INT. LAB - DAY 
A MOUSE runs through a MAZE. It reaches a fork in the path, leading to two different plastic objects, one green, one orange. The mouse hesitates, confused. He backs away from the cone. A LAB TECH makes a note. Will and Jacobs stand behind him, reading the number results on a monitor. Will's obviously discouraged. 
WILL The drug's not staying ahead of the disease. 
JACOBS But we're still making progress, right? Will tries to tamp down the frustration he's sure is written all over his face. 
WILL Sure. At this pace we'll get to trials by the time Hell freezes over. Jacobs - embarrassed in front of the Tech - pulls him aside. 
JACOBS This isn't graduate school - there's a procedure we have to adhere to. 
WILL It'll take forever. I need to start developing a primate version now. Jacobs looks at Will. He's known him a long time. 
JACOBS How's your father? Haven't seen him in a while. 
WILL This isn't about him. 
JACOBS He's worse, isn't he? Will wants to tell Jacobs the truth - he's tempted to tell him about Caesar, about Walter's treatment - but he can't. 
WILL 
(EVASIVE) He's fine. 
WE HEAR A PERSISTENT C SHARP COMING FROM A DISTANT PIANO. It's a familiar, baleful SOUND that continues over the following... 
INT. WILL'S STUDY - DAY 
Will sits in front of the computer, looking at a file crammed with MPEGs of Caesar doing puzzles and games. 
WILL (into computer mic) Caesar continues to maintain a high level of cognition. But Walter's disease has caught up to the neurogenesis treatment. Nearly all initial improvement has been erased... Will stops recording. KICKS his desk in frustration. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Walter sits at the piano, hitting his one note. Caesar passes him, heads for Will's study. 
INT. WILL'S STUDY - DAY 
Caesar enters, finds Will at the desk, head in hands. Will senses his presence. Looks up. 
CAESAR Who Caesar. 
WILL What do you mean? 
CAESAR Who. With effort, Will pulls himself from his own thoughts and tries to understand what Caesar wants from him. 
CAESAR (CONT'D) Who. 
WILL Caesar is an ape. 
(SIGNING) A chimpanzee. 
CAESAR No "what". "Who". Will is taken aback - beginning to realize the intellectual leap Caesar's taken. 
WILL Are you asking about your identity? That's abstract thought, Caesar. Caesar couldn't care less about 'abstract thought.' 
HUNSIKER Aaaaaaaah! Walter struggles to his feet and grabs Caesar again. A PULSE 
OF HUNSIKER'S BLOOD STREAKS ACROSS HIS NECK. 
WALTER Caesar! Caesar hesitates. Blood dripping down his chin, he looks over his shoulder and meets Walter's eyes. 
WALTER (CONT'D) Please stop. Hunsiker uses the distraction. He scrabbles to his feet and sprints for his house. 
CAESAR CATCHES A GLIMPSE. ANIMAL INSTINCT TAKES OVER - IT'S 
TOO BIG TO FIGHT. He races after Hunsiker. WALTER FALLS TO THE GROUND. HIS HEAD HITS THE PAVEMENT, stunning him. 
EXT. HUNSIKER'S HOUSE - DAY 
Just as Hunsiker's about to reach his front door, Caesar flies from behind - his feet hitting the door - and lands to block Hunsiker's entrance. White with terror, Hunsiker - clutching his bleeding hand to his chest - takes off running down the sidewalk. 
EXT. STREET - DAY 
Hunsiker runs for his life. He looks over his shoulder - Caesar's galloping behind, in hot pursuit. He tries to speed up - can't go any faster. Again he glances over his shoulder - Caesar's closing in. Breath coming hard, Hunsiker sprints, scrambles, desperate to escape. He looks over his shoulder-but this time CAESAR 
HAS DISAPPEARED. HE'S NOT ANYWHERE, UP OR DOWN THE STREET. Unsure where to go, half-stumbling, Hunsiker keeps running. Then, OUT OF NOWHERE, CAESAR SWINGS DOWN FROM A TREE. HE 
LANDS SQUARELY IN FRONT OF HUNSIKER, BLOCKING HIS PATH. Hunsiker backs up, changes direction, runs across the street. 
Enjoying the chase, taking his time, Caesar grabs a tree branch and swings from tree to tree. with one giant jump, he makes it to the top of a tree across the street, tracking Hunsiker like prey. Hunsiker's running out of steam. Caesar swings down in front of him and KICKS him in the chest, sending him flying. Calmly he stands over Hunsiker, who cowers. 
HUNSIKER Please no... Caesar pounds his chest, YELLING in triumph. But then he sees something across the street that abruptly pulls him out of his euphoria: WALTER - STRUGGLING, BLOODY - 
BEING HELPED TO HIS FEET. He looks down at Hunsiker, cringing. All at once CAESAR REALIZES WHAT HE'S DONE. 
EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY 
Will's car drives down a two-lane highway. 
REPORTER (V.0.) .chimpanzee named Caesar, terrorizing the quiet family enclave and mauling neighbor Douglas Hunsiker, a pilot for Global Airlines. 
INT. JACOBS' LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Jacobs watches the evening NEWS. 
REPORTER The defense claimed the chimp was merely trying to protect its owner from perceived aggression. FOOTAGE OF WILL LEAVING A COURTHOUSE, avoiding News Crews. Jacobs sits forward, turns up the volume. 
REPORTER (CONT'D) The chimpanzee's distraught owner, Wilson Rodman, has raised the animal since he was an infant. 
(MORE) 
REPORTER (CONT'D) He pleaded to keep Caesar at home, citing the ape's remarkable intelligence. Will and a chimpanzee? Jacobs stares at the TV, dumbfounded. 
INT. MOVING CAR Â»- DAY 
Will and Caesar drive. Caesar's dressed up - khaki pants and a Polo shirt. 
WILL We're visiting a place called "The Ranch". They have animals. 
CAESAR Real animals? 
WILL You bet. Apes. Chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans... Caesar GRUNTS, excited. 
WILL (CONT'D) It'll be good. You'll like it very much. Caesar looks at Will, picking up on something. 
CAESAR Will sad? 
WILL What? No, I'm fine. 
EXT. THE RANCH - DAY 
As Will pulls into the entrance, Caesar's glued to the window. 
INT. MOVING CAR - DAY 
They pull into a CLEARING. Ahead is a new world - CONCRETE AND STEEL BUILDINGS set incongruously into the bucolic countryside. A HOUSE/OFFICE, a LIVING QUARTERS, a HORSE PADDOCK - all cold, efficient structures. 
Caesar looks around. No chimps. The hose lies on the wet floor, along with the detritus of feeding time. He can HEAR the APES in the distance. Caesar tries the GATE/DOOR to the outside. LOCKED. He pauses, then makes his way toward the BRIDGE. 
EXT. ATRIUM/BRIDGE - MORNING 
Caesar walks across the bridge. To his left, (connecting to the bridge) he sees TWO MORE APE HOUSES CONNECTING TO THE 
BRIDGE: THE ORANGUTAN HOUSE - which is empty. And THE GORILLA HOUSE, which houses only one lone gorilla, BUCK, who stares out at Caesar. Caesar registers THE FACT THAT BUCK'S NOT OUT WITH THE OTHER APES. Then he moves on toward the atrium. The APES are visible inside. CAESAR GETS HIS FIRST GOOD LOOK. Over two dozen CHIMPANZEES and three ORANGUTANS roam around the atrium. The groups don't mix - chimps hang with chimps, orangutans with orangutans. They haven't noticed him yet. 
EXT. ATRIUM - DAY 
Caesar enters, heads for the tree. One by one, the apes take notice. They STOP AND STARE at this new arrival - DRESSED 
LIKE A HUMAN. 
HE'S ONE OF THEM, BUT LOOKS VERY SUBTLY DIFFERENT. GREEN 
EYES, FACE CONTOURED WITH SLIGHTLY HUMAN FEATURES, POSTURE 
MORE UPRIGHT... Caesar looks around, finds THIRTY PAIRS OF APE EYES ON HIM. Should he continue to the tree? Go back to the cage? 
He spots a BALL across the way. Moves to it - the eyes follow him. He picks it up. The eyes wait. Caesar rolls the ball to a nearby chimp. It receives the ball, gives Caesar nothing - no smile, no connection - then tosses it to Rocket. Eyes on Caesar, Rocket discards the ball like a piece of trash. His look is insolent, an unmistakable challenge. 
AFRAID, CAESAR TURNS, HEADS BACK TOWARD HIS CAGE. ROCKET 
SWINGS OVER A COUPLE OF BARS AND LANDS IN FRONT OF HIM. Caesar tries to walk around. Rocket blocks his path, reaches out and pulls at Caesar's sleeve, as if to examine the material. Caesar jerks his arm away. Rocket bares his teeth, raises his arms. Caesar considers the options - should he run? Before he can make a move, Rocket GRUNTS, grabs his shirt at the chest. Caesar tries to push Rocket away, but the larger chimp throws Caesar to the ground, pinning him. Caesar struggles to get away, accidentally SLAPPING Rocket across the face. OUTRAGED, Rocket SLAMS his hand on Caesar's chest and starts POUNDING him. Caesar tries to block the blows, but they're coming hard and fast: his head, his stomach, his chest. Apes SHRIEK, jump up and down, egging Rocket on. Caesar manages to break loose, crawling away. Rocket grabs at his shirt, drags Caesar closer. He opens his mouth wide, moving sharp teeth toward Caesar's face. Caesar struggles, barely holds him off - and... 
.ROCKET BITES HIS ARM. BLOOD SPURTS. BAM! A SHOT RINGS OUT. Chimps scatter. Stunned, Rocket spins around - HIS MOUTH FULL OF CAESAR'S BLOOD - AND SEES DODGE OUTSIDE THE CAGE, RIFLE IN HAND. He pulls a TRANQUILIZING DART from his shoulder. Caesar starts to move off - 
BAM! DODGE SHOOTS A TRANQUILIZER DART INTO THE SIDE OF 
CAESAR'S NECK - HE GRABS AT THIS THROAT AND FALLS. 
BAM! DODGE SHOOTS ROCKET AGAIN. 
Caesar rolls over to look up... as Rocket topples onto him. Out cold. 
INT. RANCH INFIRMARY - DAY 
Caesar lies on a medical table, NECK AND LEFT ARM BANDAGED. His shirt's ripped, and he's still wearing the khaki pants, now filthy and torn. TIGHT STRAPS RUN ACROSS HIS CHEST, 
PINNING HIM TO THE TABLE. It's a small room furnished with meagre medical equipment. Rocket's across the way, unconscious but breathing, restrained to a medical table. Caesar opens his eyes. Takes a moment to get his bearings. 
VOICE Caesar. Stewart stands over him. The light shines'behind her head. 
STEWART Do you remember me? I'm Dr. Stewart. She hands him a cup of water with a straw. 
STEWART (CONT'D) Drink. Caesar doesn't want the water. He signs. She clearly doesn't understand. He signs again. 
STEWART (CONT'D) I don't understand. Caesar's desperate. He opens his mouth, makes a LONG, LOW SOUND. She's taken aback - is he trying to speak? 
STEWART (CONT-D) Can you show me? Show me what you need. Caesar pulls at the restraints. 
STEWART (CONT'D) I can't take those off. Caesar sags with defeat, overcome with DESPAIR. 
STEWART (CONT'D) I'm sorry this has happened, Caesar. So sorry. Stewart stares at him. Moved at the complexity of his emotion, the obvious intelligence behind his pain. 
STEWART (CONT'D) I'm here once a week. I'll do my best to look after you. 
EXT. STORAGE SHED - DAY 
Dodge pulls heavy bags of Primate Chow from a truck, stacking them in a SHED. He spots Stewart striding towards him, and-- Ducks out of sight, vainly brushing back his hair. 
STEWART (O.S.) What were you thinking? 
DODGE oh, hey Doc. 
STEWART That chimp needs protection. Dodge's face falls. 
STEWART (CONT'D) You could've gotten him killed. 
DODGE 
WILL Thank you... I appreciate that. Awkward beat. 
STEWART Well. If you give me your number I'll let you know from time to time how things are going - 
WILL Let's grab a drink. Takes her by surprise. Maybe takes him by surprise too. She's happy he asked. 
STEWART Love to. 
EXT. RANCH GROUNDS - NIGHT 
Nighttime. 
INT. ORANGUTAN HOUSE - NIGHT 
A repulsive bowl of primate chow. Caesar - bandaged, beat-up and miserable - picks at it. In the next cage, the orangutans sleep. ROCK AND ROLL MUSIC. Dodge and Rodney drive up in a truck, windows down, radio blaring. Dodge gets out, cigarette in his mouth, and moves drunkenly to the storage shed. 40 He emerges with two BEERS, throws one to Rodney. 
Caesar watches as Dodge offers a beer can to a chimpanzee. 
DODGE Want a beer? The chimp reaches but Dodge pulls it away. 
DODGE (CONT'D) Here's a little taste of beer... He unzips his fly and PISSES INTO THE CHIMP'S FEEDING TROUGH. Caesar watches, disgusted. 
INT. ORANGUTAN HOUSE -- MORNING 
A LEVER THROWN OPEN. Caesar watches as Dodge opens all the chimpanzee house cages in succession. Rodney moves to the orangutan house. CAESAR PAYS CLOSE 
ATTENTION TO THE LOCK AS IT SLIDES OPEN. 
DODGE & RODNEY Move it! Let's go! Dodge and Rodney herd the apes from their cages, brandishing ELECTRIC CATTLE PRODS. The primates rouse themselves, move across the bridge. On his way out, an orangutan, MAURICE - WISE COUNTENANCE, ORANGE AND WHITE BEARD - takes a moment to check Caesar out, then moves off to join the others. Caesar maneuvers to get a better view. Rocket walks, king-like, among the apes. Caesar watches him push a smaller MALE aside. The Male defers, extending his arm forward, palm up, supplicating. ROCKET CASUALLY RUNS HIS 
HAND, PALM DOWN, OVER THE OUTSTRETCHED ONE. Rocket's the cock of the walk - the ALPHA MALE. Caesar shifts his attention to the GORILLA, Buck - still alone in his cage, staring through the bars, miserable. Why doesn't the gorilla ever get to go out? Then something across the ranch catches Caesar's eye: WILL'S 
CAR'S DRIVING UP TO THE OFFICE. 
His heart skips a beat. He moves to the bars, barely able to contain his excitement. 
EXT. RANCH GROUNDS - DAY 
Will waits at a picnic table as Dodge approaches with Caesar on a leash. He's immediately struck by Caesar's injured appearance, but he plasters a smile on his face. Caesar's clearly thrilled to see him. 
WILL There you are! I heard what happened. 
CAESAR 
(SIGNING) Home now. Caesar home. He tugs Will away from Dodge. 
WILL I'm going to get you out of here, but not today. I'm working on it. Caesar's face falls. 
WILL (CONT'D) Soon. I promise. Will notices Dodge's ELECTRIC CATTLE PROD. 
CAESAR 
(SIGNING) Home. Still a question, a flicker of hope. 
WILL (kills him to say it) Not yet. I can't yet. Caesar realizes: Will's going to leave him here. First incredulous - then outraged - Caesar turns away and starts walking back to his cage. 
WILL (CONT'D) Wait a second - Caesar, where are you going? â¢ Caesar doesn't respond, doesn't turn, just keeps walking. Dodge catches up with him. 
DODGE (loud enough for Will) No place like home, huh monkey boy? 
WILL Caesar - come back here! He watches Caesar's retreating back, Dodge trotting alongside him. Realizes Caesar's nearly breaking into a run. 
EXT. ORANGUTAN HOUSE - DAY 
Dodge locks Caesar in his cell. Then moves around to the... 
EXT. STORAGE SHED - DAY 
.storage shed. He notices Will's car still parked in front of the office... just as - BAM! WILL DECKS HIM WITH A FIST TO THE FACE. Dodge hits the ground. Will stands over him, too livid to realize he might've just broken his hand. 
WILL You son of a bitch. Dodge scrabbles to his feet, wipes the blood from his nose. 
(THROUGH MASK) Boy, he's a calm one, isn't he? Will tilts the nozzle, releasing a BLAST OF AEROSOL MIST INTO 
KOBA'S NOSE AND MOUTH. 
THE CHIMPANZEE CONVULSES ON THE TABLE. 
INT. STEWART'S KITCHEN - NIGHT 
CHOP STICKS digging into take-out Chinese. Stewart and Will sit in her kitchen, eating. It's clear from their state of dress (or undress) that they've been intimate. Because his hand is still bandaged, he's having a hard time with the chopsticks. 
STEWART You actually punched him? 
WILL I did. She thinks it's funny. 
STEWART I've been wanting to do that since the day I met him. 
WILL I don't advise it. My hand's killing me. 
STEWART Here. Let me help you out. She begins feeding him the Chinese food. He puts down his chopsticks. 
WILL I'm going to get him out of there. 
STEWART I know you are. 
WILL And I'm going to get my dad back too. 
INT. ORANGUTAN HOUSE - NIGHT 
Caesar tapes sticks together. WE SEE that he's created a THREE-FOOT LONG "ARM". He tapes the scissors firmly to its end, finger holes sticking out. Finished. Silently he moves to the edge of the cage. USING THE 
CONTRAPTION, HE LOOPS THE FINGER HOLES OVER THE LATCH. He tries once. Misses. Twice. Misses again. Caesar keeps trying... until finally the loop's in place. Then he begins to tug. Tug. Tug. CLICK - the LATCH OPENS. He glances over to Maurice, who silently watches. Caesar pushes open the cage door. MAURICE'S EYES FOLLOW HIM 
INTO THE NIGHT. 
EXT. BRIDGE AREA - NIGHT 
Caesar walks across the bridge. He passes the entrance to the chimpanzee house - and keeps going. 
EXT. GORILLA HOUSE - NIGHT 
He arrives at the Gorilla House. Buck's visible in his cage, asleep on a bed of straw. Caesar unlocks the door latch and opens the cage door. He waits, but Buck doesn't budge. He's still fast asleep. Caesar hesitates. Then he slowly... 
INT. BUCK'S CAGE - NIGHT 
.enters the cage, edging up to the sleeping gorilla. From this vantage point, Buck looks enormous, his vast chest rising and falling with sleep. Caesar very carefully wiggles his toe. There's a GRUNT and a WHIRL OF BLACK FURRY MOVEMENT. Caesar finds himself staring into the huge, angry gorilla face. Caesar - nervous - beckons toward the open door. Buck understands but can't believe it. For a moment he doesn't move. Caesar makes the gesture again -- "Come on, let's go." Before he can finish, Buck bursts past him... 
EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT 
.across the bridge... 
EXT. ATRIUM - NIGHT 
.and into the atrium. Caesar follows. The full moon shines down on Buck, the tree, the climbing structure. The gorilla feels his feet on the grass, savoring every step. Then he begins to run. He runs as fast as he can, all the way across the atrium, then all the way back. Back and forth, GORILLA WIND SPRINTS of freedom. Caesar stands back, silently watching. 
EXT. STORAGE SHED - MORNING 
A morning like any other. Dodge goes through his routine: 0 opening the door, wheeling out a wheelbarrow. 
He makes his way to the ape houses. 
EXT. GORILLA HOUSE - MORNING 
Dodge and his wheelbarrow approach the Gorilla House. Closer and closer to the cage... until they're right in front. The CAGE DOOR'S CLOSED, BUCK INSIDE. Dodge shovels primate chow into the gorilla's trough. 
BUCK TAKES A HANDFUL AND LOOKS ACROSS TO CAESAR, WHO RETURNS 
HIS GAZE FROM THE ORANGUTAN HOUSE. 
INT. ORANGUTAN CAGE - MORNING 
Caesar senses something: Maurice is staring at him. Caesar 's beginning to wonder what Maurice wants when the ORANGUTAN 
WILL (CONT'D) You know what I want. You're just not going to give it to me. Koba puts out a palm. There's A LOOK IN HIS EYE, MALEVOLENT, 
DISQUIETING. 
AND SOMETHING ELSE: HIS EYES HAVE CHANGED. THEY LOOK 
SOMEWHAT LIKE CAESAR'S - GREENER, LESS SIMIAN... 
WILL (V.0.) (CONT'D) What do you think of Koba? 
INT. PRIMATE HOUSE - DAY 
We look through cage bars at Will and Franklin, who stand far away, across the room. 
FRANKLIN You wanna know if I think the 113's making him nuts. 
WILL I know he's smart. But there's something else, something worrisome. He challenges me. Taunts me. Will looks toward us, toward the bars. 
WILL (CONT'D) (almost to himself) I don't want to try it on... 
(CATCHES HIMSELF) .I don't want to start human trials if there's any chance of danger. 
FRANKLIN What you're seeing has nothing to do with the 113, Doc. The apes're just like us - they're complex. Some are loyal, some are selfish, some have a good sense of humor. And some are born rotten. Koba moves into frame. We've been watching from his point of view, from inside the cage. Now we look over his shoulder, where the sharp planes of his â¢ face frame the two men across the room. 
FRANKLIN (CONT'D) This one's a bad apple, that's all. A chill runs down Will's spine. 
EXT. GEN-SYS LABORATORIES/MAIN GATE - DAY 
A car pulls up to the gate. Evans is driving. He looks ill. 
GUARD 
(OPENING GATE) Early day today, Evans? 
EVANS Actually I'm not feeling too good. 
EVANS GETS A SHIVER. 
GUARD You know what: Whiskey, lemon, honey and a cup of hot water. Never fails. 
EVANS Thanks - I'm on it. Evans drives off. 
EXT. PADDOCK - DAY 
Stewart sits atop one of the ranch horses, looking down at the chimpanzee area. She watches CAESAR walking across the bridge. Caesar moves easily among the apes, his Alpha Male status clear as the others make way for him. Stewart's relieved - and a little surprised - to see Caesar so at ease with the other apes. 
INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE - DAY 
ROCKET'S MISERABLE. Dodge and Rodney watch him through the bars. 
RODNEY Still won't eat, won't come out. 
DODGE I can fix that. Dodge drags the hose to Rocket's cage. 
DODGE (CONT'D) Get that monkey ass out of there! 
INT. ORANGUTAN CAGE - DAY 
Caesar watches Dodge BLAST Rocket with WATER. Rocket doesn't struggle, doesn't fight back. The harsh jet pelts his back. 
INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE/ROCKET'S CAGE - NIGHT 
Rocket sleeps. The FEEDER BIN OPENS AND SHUTS, waking him. Tentatively, Rocket peers inside the bin: A COOKIE. Never seen a cookie before. Rocket picks it up. Smells it. Takes a taste. Wow. He gobbles it down. At that moment Rocket's CAGE DOOR OPENS. Caesar stands holding a LARGE BAG OF CHIPS AHOY. He tosses a cookie to Rocket. Beckons him out of the cage. 
INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE/COMMON AREA - NIGHT 
Rocket exits warily, on his guard for anything... But Caesar simply stands with the cookie bag. No gorilla. No shovel. He hands the cookie bag to Rocket. Rocket watches - confused - as CAESAR PULLS THE MAIN LEVER, 
OPENING ALL THE CAGES AT ONCE. CHIMPS EMERGE, bewildered. Rocket stands with the cookie bag, unsure what to do. Caesar makes a motion with his hand. Now Rocket understands. He gives a cookie to the nearest chimp. Then another one. Then another. The chimps go crazy for the cookies. THEY GATHER AROUND 
ROCKET, WHO PROUDLY DISTRIBUTES THEM. A TRANSFORMATIVE 
WILL I was too late. She puts the photo down, cuddles against him. 
STEWART You tried. You worked really hard. Walter knew that. 
WILL Wasn't good enough though, was it. ANGLE ON THE PHOTOGRAPH. It shows a younger Walter and his two teenage sons... 
INT. LAB - NIGHT 
Franklin's on the phone. 
FRANKLIN Just checking in. You didn't show up at work today. 
CUT TO: 
INT. EVANS' APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Crummy little place. TV's on with no sound. WE HEAR FRANKLIN'S VOICE through the phone machine. 
FRANKLIN (O.S.) Hope you're feeling better - let me know if you need anything. 
REVEAL EVANS, LYING IN BED, DEAD - a streak of brown dried blood across his cheek -- as if draining from his lifeless eye. 
EXT. RANCH - NIGHT 
Deep night at the ranch. A moon half-hidden by clouds. 
INT. ORANGUTAN CAGE - NIGHT 
Caesar uses his contraption to get out of the cage. Maurice grabs his arm. 
MAURICE Where go? 
CAESAR Find Mother. 
EXT. RANCH/PRIMATE HOUSES - NIGHT 
Caesar slips out of the orangutan house, heads toward the 
GATE. As he passes the chimpanzee house HE HEARS A CHIMPANZEE CALL OUT. He turns. Finds Rocket staring out at him, wanting to go with him. Caesar hesitates. Rocket CALLS OUT LOUDER. To quiet him, Caesar walks over to Rocket's cage, but as he gets closer, he sees something that gives him pause: ROCKET'S 
EYES HAVE CHANGED. Caesar gets right up against the bars of Rocket's cage, takes Rocket's face in his hands and looks into his eyes: THEY ARE 
UNMISTAKABLY GREEN. Reeling, Caesar tries to make sense of this. And then he remembers the bite. Rocket bit him. He looks down at the wound on his arm, now nearly healed. Has Caesar's blood changed Rocket? Caesar opens Rocket's'cage. The chimp emerges, ready for anything. 
EXT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE - NIGHT 
Caesar and Rocket barrel across the ranch, past the living â¢ quarters, past the barn, onto the winding road leading away. 
EXT. NEAR-DESERTED TWO LANE HIGHWAY - NIGHT 
Middle of the night, only a few cars. Caesar and Rocket stick to bushes and shadows. They wait for a break in traffic, cross the highway. 
EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN - NIGHT 
In the distance the LIGHTS of the TOWN give a glow to the night sky. Caesar and Rocket gallop toward it. 
EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT 
Dark, quiet. RUSTLING IN THE TREES, as if a storm is coming. 
SUDDENLY CAESAR BURSTS THROUGH, SWINGING FOR THE NEXT TREE A moment later ROCKET FOLLOWS. Swinging from tree to tree, they make their way down the suburban street. 
INT. WILL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
CLOSE ON WILL'S SLEEPING FACE. 
CREAK, CREAK... CREAK, CREAK. WILL'S WAKENED by the NOISE. What is that? 
CREAK, CREAK. . .CREAK, CREAK. It's coming from outside. REVEAL STEWART asleep next to Will. He gets out of bed, moves to the window, looks into the back yard. 
THE SWING MOVES BACK AND FORTH, AS IF RECENTLY OCCUPIED. Will scans the grounds - no movement, nothing to see. Satisfied, he climbs back in bed and closes his eyes. 
(LISTENING) Caesar? Dodge fed them breakfast about half an hour ago... He holds up a PAIR OF BINOCULARS, looks toward the atrium and ape houses. Can't see anything wrong. 
MR. LANDON (CONT'D) Let me call you back... He HEARS THE BACK KITCHEN DOOR OPEN. RUSTLING NOISES in the kitchen. Opening and closing of cabinets. 
MR. LANDON (CONT'D) Hey Dodge - Stewart just called - WE FOLLOW HIM out of the living-room, into the... 
INT. RANCH/KITCHEN - MORNING 
.kitchen. 
MR. LANDON She said that - 
Landon goes pale. ROCKET AND TWO OTHER CHIMPANZEES ARE 
STANDING IN THE KITCHEN. 
EXT. RANCH GROUNDS - MORNING 
The two CHIMPANZEES drag Mr. Landon toward the Ape Houses. Rocket follows, munching cereal from a box of Cheerios. 
IN THE DISTANCE Rodney's visible, being dragged, SCREAMING. 
EXT. RANCH GROUNDS - DAY 
Will's car speeds up to the gate and stops. 
STEWART 
(ON PHONE) No one's answering. In the distance they can HEAR the PHONE RINGING at the ranch house. From where the car is, nothing out of the ordinary is visible. Will thinks a moment, gets out of the car. 
WILL You go get help. 
STEWART Not a way in the world. I'm coming with you. 
EXT. RANCH HOUSE - DAY 
They sneak into the back of the ranch house. All is quiet. 
INT. RANCH HOUSE - DAY 
But once inside, the level of destruction is immediately visible: Overturned table and chairs, plates smashed, cupboards emptied. 
STEWART Oh my God... I'm calling 911.. Will picks up Landon's BINOCULARS, moves to the front window. HE SEES: Debris everywhere. Apes free, wandering... DODGE, LANDON and RODNEY BATTERED AND IN CAGES. 
AND - IN THE ATRIUM - SURROUNDED BY HIS CLOSEST FOLLOWERS... 
.CAESAR. CLEARLY THE ALPHA MALE. Clearly in control. 
WILL Caesar. Will lowers the binoculars as Stewart rushes in. She's trembling. 
STEWART It's going to take them at least half an hour to get here. He begins rummaging in drawers, in cabinets. There's an empty cookie bag, but Will's able to put his hands on a couple of stray COOKIES. He has an idea. Under the sink he finds what he's looking for: RAT POISON. 
STEWART (CONT'D) What are you doing? 
WILL I'm going to kill him. 
STEWART 
(HORRIFIED) Caesar? 
WILL He's dangerous. 
STEWART You're wrong - he can't have been the one who killed that man - 
WILL There is no other explanation. A BLACK SHADOW passes by the window. Then another. Stewart turns. Now there's another. They're surrounded. She SCREAMS. Will barricades the back door with a table. Chimpanzees at every window BANGING ON THE GLASS, wanting in. 
GLASS SHATTERS. Will and Stewart run to the front room, just as the door 
CRASHES OFF ITS HINGES - REVEALING BUCK. 
INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE - DAY 
A hillside park overlooking San Francisco bay. THICK FOG moving in. KIDS EVERYWHERE - slides, seesaws, climbing structures. A LITTLE GIRL plays in a sandbox. Her MOTHER reads on a bench nearby. The Girl looks up, claps her hands. 
GIRL Monkey! OVER HER SHOULDER WE SEE A CHIMPANZEE HEADING OUR WAY. Then another. And another. 
REVEAL THREE DOZEN APES EMERGING FROM THE FOG, MAKING THEIR 
WAY DOWN THE SLOPE. suddenly the Little Girl's not so sure. 
PEOPLE START TO NOTICE - GRAB THEIR KIDS. The Mother looks up from her book. SOMEONE SCREAMS. 
GIRL (CONT'D) Mommy? The Girl's surrounded now by moving apes --- the Mother can't get to her. 
MOTHER April! Suddenly Caesar doubles back from the lead. He scoops her up and puts her down out of harm's way. Then he continues herding the apes forward. He knows where he's going. SIRENS APPROACH. Squad cars give chase. 
INT. HELICOPTER - DAY 
Fog rolls in off the bay. Will's strapped into his seat, looking down at the city below. 
HUFFS You see them? 
WILL No, I can't see - 
STEWART Oh my god. Seated next to Will, she draws him to her window. FAR BELOW: it looks like a BLACK LOCUST moving through the urban sprawl - chased by numerous Squad Cars - directly behind them, along parallel streets... She realizes something. 
STEWART (CONT'D) I know where they're going. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SAN FRANCISCO ZOO - DAY 
A SIGN: THE SAN FRANCISCO ZOO. FAMILIES. Hot dog stands and ice cream vendors. The fun is interrupted by the SOUND OF HELICOPTERS sweeping low overhead. Faces turn skyward... 
A moment later, Caesar and his apes RUMBLE IN. Chaos. PEOPLE scatter. SCREAM. Released balloons float lazily upward. 
INT. HELICOPTER OVER THE ZOO - DAY 
Will watches Caesar moving the apes down the zoo's pathways, dodging people, jumping over benches. 
WILL He's going to release the apes. Looking to his left, Will sees a sniper try to get shots off - but hesitate. The apes are too interspersed with fleeing PATRONS. 
EXT. SAN FRANCISCO ZOO - DAY 
As the apes pass other enclosures, the ANIMALS GO NUTS. Lions ROAR. Giraffes run back and forth. 
INT. SAN FRANCISCO ZOO/APE ENCLOSURE - DAY 
WRANGLER What the hell am I supposed to do when they get here?! An APE WRANGLER screams into a wall phone at the Ape Enclosure. The ZOO APES are agitated and anxious - they know something's coming. Suddenly the phone is ripped from wall. The Wrangler cowers, turns to see Caesar and his apes. Rocket rattles the door, bares his teeth. The Wrangler understands - fumbles for his keys. 
SOUND OF BOLTS AND LOCKS CLICKING OPEN. 
INT./EXT. APE ENCLOSURE/ZOO - DAY 
All kinds of apes - Chimps, Orangutans, Gorillas - rush from their separate enclosures. Caesar's apes are waiting for them. Caesar makes eye contact with the GRIZZLED OLD MALE CHIMPANZEE. Then - as a unit - they all run for the exit. 
By now, ALL THE ANIMALS ARE GOING CRAZY. Above, the sky is full of helicopters now -- some Police, some News Crews. 
INT. HELICOPTER OVER THE ZOO - DAY 
Apes are visible streaming from the zoo and emptying onto the street. 
DODGE That's him! The one with the white on his shoulder! A SNIPER takes aim at Caesar - the BULLET RICOCHETS OFF THE 
SIDEWALK. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. LAB - DAY 
Jacobs watches a TOW TRUCK pull away with his ruined black Jaguar in tow. He climbs into a waiting taxi. He looks like hell. 
INT. TAXI - DAY 
DODGE IS AMONG THEM. 
AT THE SOUTH END OF THE BRIDGE Caesar and his apes race forward. 
INT. HELICOPTER - DAY 
Will and Stewart watch from above as the apes stream Northward, over and around stopped cars. 
HUFFS 
(INTO HEADSET) Tell them to hold their fire until they get past the traffic! WILL SEES below that soon Caesar and the apes will reach a place on the bridge where there are no more cars. Then they'll be open season. Then HE SEES the FOUR SQUAD CARS slowly approaching from the north end of the bridge, SHARPSHOOTERS - and DODGE - on foot behind them. 
ON THE BRIDGE Caesar looks ahead - realizes that he's at the end of the bridge traffic. Ahead is empty roadway. And the slowly approaching squad cars. He looks up at the helicopters, rifles at the ready. 
He sees the FOG, swirling in and out of the SUSPENSION 
CABLES. Caesar SIGNALS TO MAURICE. Maurice glances over the bridge railing. The Bay churns and swirls hundreds of feet below. Caesar BARKS at Maurice, who then climbs over the railing, taking the orangutans and a handful of chimps with him. Caesar BARKS a command at BUCK - who waits by the last car with a PACK OF GORILLAS and some chimps. Then Caesar starts to climb. Shimmying up a cable and into the fog. Rocket's right behind. The remaining apes follow. 
INT. HELICOPTER - DAY 
From the sky Will sees Caesar divide up his army. Chimps ascend cables, disappearing in and out of patches of fog. Orangutans and apes descend below the bridge deck. And Buck with his gorilla, take refuge in the stalled traffic. 
BELOW THE BRIDGE Maurice finds bars and support beams. He and the below-deck apes begin swinging their way toward the.north end. 
ABOVE BRIDGE Apes shimmying up cables appear out of the fog, arriving at the MAIN CABLE - the thick one running along the top. They start scampering and swinging north, the FOG MOVING AND 
SWIRLING, CHANGING SHAPE AROUND THEM. A SHARPSHOOTER from a helicopter takes a SHOT. A CHIMP FALLS TO HIS DEATH. It's a long fall, until - SPLASH the chimp hits the water. They keep moving. 
ON THE BRIDGE The FOUR PATROL CARS stop, creating a barricade. The Sharpshooters line up their rifles, ready to shoot. 
DODGE SEARCHES A SQUAD CAR, FINDS A RIFLE, AND LOCKS AND 
LOADS. They FIRE at the apes above them, but it's tough going - the apes are in constant motion, and the fog obscures them. BULLETS can be heard RICOCHETING off cables. Another chimp falls to its death. Then a heavy patch of fog rolls in, engulfing the middle part of the bridge, surrounding the barricade. Visibility's practically zero. 
NOW THE MEN AT THE BARRICADE CAN HEAR THE APES MOVE PAST THEM 
IN THE FOG. 
OFFICER They're all around us! Apes swing above them, scamper by them. Movement - WHOOSH - 
WHOOSH... DODGE - nervous - crouches low. He edges backwards, hopeful of some visibility. That's when he SEES CAESAR, CLEAR AND OUT OF THE FOG, 
CLIMBING UP THE ASCENDING CABLES OF THE NORTH SIDE. 
WITH RELISH, DODGE READIES HIS RIFLE, AIMS AT CAESAR'S BACK. There's glare from a ray of sunlight that's broken through the fog. He SHOOTS, BARELY MISSING. The bullet RICOCHETS off the main cable. ROCKET, climbing behind Caesar, looks down - SEES DODGE AIMING AGAIN. He starts swinging towards Caesar. Another shot from Dodge. This time the BULLET GRAZES 
CAESAR'S SHOULDER, AND CAESAR STUMBLES, STARTS TO FALL. 
ROCKET REACHES HIM IN TIME - SNATCHES HIS ARM, HOLDING CAESAR 
UP. Then, using all his strength, ROCKET PULLS CAESAR BACK UP TO 
THE MAIN CABLE. 
BAM! Rocket's hit in the back! He and Caesar make eye contact as ROCKET FALLS OFF THE 
BRIDGE, TUMBLING TO HIS DEATH. Caesar SCREAMS, looks down at Dodge, who aims again. But Dodge is diverted by a RUMBLING - like an EARTHQUAKE ON 
THE BRIDGE. The GORILLAS ARE IN MOTION. LEAD BY BUCK, THEY CHARGE TOWARD 
THE BARRICADE. Like a freight train of menacing power. Helicopters FIRE, MEN at the barricade SHOOT as they try to back up. A gorilla falls... but they keep on coming. And now, climbing up from below - behind the barricade -- MAURICE AND THE ORANGUTANS join in. Their sheer numbers and power are unstoppable. 
BELOW THE BRIDGE Koba hangs back. He's away from the action, but the battle waged above is audible. He creeps along toward the North end of the bridge. 
AERIAL VIEW As the fog lifts for a moment, WE SEE APES SWINGING ON 
CABLES, APES RAMPAGING DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THE BRIDGE, AND 
APES SCAMPERING BELOW. Vanquishing the humans. 
ON THE BRIDGE 
Will enters the clearing. He knows this place. Up ahead is the GROVE OF TREES with the CANOPY that Caesar always loved. 
EXT. MUIR WOODS/PARKING LOT - DUSK 
Huffs stands looking at his watch. He looks up, turns to an 
ASSEMBLED GROUP OF ARMED MEN. 
HUFFS Follow me. Stewart double-takes, sees the ARMY HEAD OFF IN WILL'S 
DIRECTION, GUNS READY. 
STEWART Hang on a second... (to nearest Officer) Where are they going? 
Looks are exchanged. Someone grabs Stewart, who struggles with all her might. 
STEWART (CONT'D) 
WHERE ARE THEY GOING?! 
EXT. PARK/CLEARING - DUSK 
Quiet here. Will heads toward the Grove of Trees. 
WILL Caesar! ... He keeps walking, almost there. A DARK FIGURE DROPS DOWN IN 
FRONT OF HIM. 
IT'S KOBA. Will takes a step back, fear crawling up the back of his neck. 
WILL (CONT'D) You. Koba stands up tall. Eyes Will. He takes his time - like he's enjoying every second of this... He walks towards will, bares his teeth. Suddenly CAESAR APPEARS, SLAMMING INTO KOBA, knocking him away. 
ENRAGED, KOBA STARTS TO CHALLENGE CAESAR... BUT CAESAR JUST 
STARES HIM DOWN. 
KOBA - THE COWARD - SLINKS OFF, DISAPPEARING INTO THE WOODS. Which leaves just Will and Caesar. 
CAESAR Humans coming. 
WILL No. I'm alone. Will pauses - there's so much he wants to say. 
WILL (CONT'D) I owe you an apology. 
CAESAR Will want Caesar dead. 
WILL I thought you had killed a man. But I should have known better. Caesar's face is unreadable. Will can't tell what he's thinking. 
WILL (CONT'D) I want you to know that all of this is my fault. My responsibility. 
(BEAT) Can you forgive me? BIRDS TAKE SUDDEN FLIGHT. Caesar's eyes shift to the path. Will realizes he's been betrayed. 
WILL (CONT'D) 
(PANICKED) Wait - no - 
CAESAR Will leave. 
WILL I won't - 
CAESAR Will leave now. 
WILL No. I'm staying with you. Caesar pushes him. Will staggers backwards, falls down. At that moment, HUFFS and his ARMY step into the clearing. Huffs takes aim at Caesar. 
WILL (CONT'D) 
NO! 
HE RUSHES CAESAR JUST AS HUFFS PULLS THE TRIGGER. THE BLAST 
OF THE GUN SHATTERS THE FOREST'S SILENCE.

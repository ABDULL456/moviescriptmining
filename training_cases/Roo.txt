1   INT. ROOM - NIGHT                                             1 
Darkness. The faint background hum of a refrigerator. A light clicks on, briefly, then snaps off again. 
Then on again, for a little longer. 
We wake groggily with JACK (five), blinking up at MA (26). She's standing in a worn t-shirt and underwear beside a lamp, switching it on and off at apparently random intervals. She cranes up at the recessed skylight, Room's only window. 
The irregular flashes of lamp-light reveal glimpses of this little world lined with cork: ten foot a side, seven foot high, gabled ceiling rising to ten foot. 
Clusters of Jack's and Ma's vivid drawings are pinned all over the walls, quivering in the draft from the vents. Done with five crayons (red, yellow, blue, orange, green) and pencil on toilet tissue, lined pages or cardboard, they show dogs, trees, aliens, rocket ships, figures labelled 'Jack' or 'Ma'. Delicate mobiles (uncooked spaghetti, threads, plastics, foil, down from pillows, cloth scraps) dangle. 
A wardrobe with slatted louver doors. On top, toys crafted from garbage, a Labyrinth from toilet-roll insides. 
A dresser with a TV. A homemade pack of cards, papier mâché checkers and chess. A Fort constructed from vitamin and other bottles and cans. A single meagre African violet in a pot on the TV. 
A round dining table, two fold-up chairs side by side. 
A bath with a single small towel over the side. A toilet, with a flotilla of homemade toy boats floating in the tank which is oddly missing a lid. 
A sink, with a single worn toothbrush, toothpaste, dish soap, a broken comb, folded rags for washcloths. A small square of mirror tile hung up over it. 
A small kitchen cabinet. A dish rack: two each of big and small white plates, bowls, tumblers, knives, forks, spoons (one with a melted handle), a scissors, can opener, serrated knife, wooden spoon, spatula. 
A basic stove (with more folded rags on its handle, for pot holders), one frying pan and one saucepan. 
A small refrigerator (more toys on top), a tiny trash.

A rocker.    Above, a shelf. Ten books stacked. Homemade toys. 
A reddish Persian-style rug on the floor. 
A grey steel door, no handle. On the wall, a ten-digit keypad with a red light like a watching eye. 
Ma looks over at Jack and sees that he's awake. She mouths 'Sh' at him, soothing him back to sleep. Keeps signalling. 
Darkness again, as Jack's eyelids fall.

Faint light. Jack and Ma sleep face to face in a double bed under a thin quilt. Pale skin, long hair, wearing t-shirts. 
JACK (V.O.) You cried all day and left TV on till you were a zombie. But then I zoomed down from heaven through Skylight into Room - (makes noise of descent, then crash landing) and I was kicking you from the inside, boom boom, and then I shot out onto Rug with my eyes wide open, and you cutted the cord and said "Hello Jack." 
Jack wakes. 
JACK Ma. I'm five!

A little later, Ma, at the kitchen counter, measures out two small bowls of cereal. 
Jack moves round Room touching things: Rug's rusty bloodstain from his birth; the scarred Table; chairs; faucets, etc. 
JACK Morning lamp, Morning rug, Morning wardrobe .. (he looks under the bed) (MORE)

Ma puts breakfast on the table. Sits. 
Jack sits, too. Ma gives him a half vitamin pill from an almost empty tub. She takes a contraceptive pill from a generic pack. They start to eat. Ma winces. 
JACK (CONT'D) Is Bad Tooth hurting? 
MA (taps her head) Mind over matter. 
He taps his head too as he chants the slogan. 
JACK If we don't mind, it doesn't matter. 
MA Guess what we're going to make later. 
JACK What? 
MA A cake. 
JACK A birthday cake, like in TV? 
MA Maybe she's tired. 
14   INT. ROOM - DAY                                              14 
Jack, on the bed: he squirms, twists, bounces with intense boyish energy. 
Beside the bed now, he runs on the spot at maximum speed. In the background we see Ma cooking.

Later the same day. Ma is napping. Jack is playing on the floor. Counting things. Tracing the patterns of rug with his finger. 
What was that? He stares at the floor by the stove; glimpses something. 
Jack tiptoes over, but the moving thing is gone. He looks furtively at Ma then takes out the cake. He crumbles some and sets the plate on the floor. He squats and waits. 
A mouse puts its nose out, sniffs and takes a crumb. 
Something smashes into the stove: one of Ma's heavy books. 
Jack cries out in shock and distress. 
JACK You made him gone! 
Ma starts to sweep up the crumbs. 
JACK (CONT'D) He was an alive thing, he was real! 
MA They'd steal our food. 
She crawls under the counter, finds the hole. Tears aluminum foil from the roll. Scrunches it. JACK Mouse can have my food, I'm not hungry. 
MA They'd bring in germs, bite us in the night. 
(CONTINUED) 16   CONTINUED:                                                16 
JACK Mouse is my friend and you splatted him dead. 
MA No I didn't, he's hunky-dory. 
She stops blocking up the hole to hug Jack. 
JACK Are you just tricking me? 
MA I swear, he's safe at home with his Ma in the backyard. 
JACK What backyard? 
Ma, realizing her slip, tidies up instead of answering. 
JACK (CONT'D) Mouse lives in a yard in TV? 
Ma holds up the aluminum foil to distract him. 
MA Hey, let's make a UFO with this. 
Jack brings out the other grudge he's been nursing. 
JACK Why you didn't tell Old Nick it was my birthday? 
MA Because he's not our friend. 
JACK He said he'd brung me a present. 
MA You shouldn't hear what he - You're meant to be asleep. 
JACK I never had a present. 
MA He didn't mean it. 
JACK It might be Lucky my dog. 
(CONTINUED) 16   CONTINUED: (2)                                           16 
MA Jack. We can't have a dog. We don't have room - (sees him misunderstand) - space, enough space - cooped up in here with the barking, the scratching... 
JACK Lucky won't scratch, he promises. 
MA There is no Lucky! 
JACK Yeah there is. 
MA He's just made-up, in your head, he's not real. 
Devastated, Jack bursts into tears. 
Ma sits down beside him and strokes him. 
17   INT. ROOM - NIGHT                                            17 
That evening. Jack sits in Ma's lap, watching a TALK-SHOW hostess interview a one-armed war veteran. Ma is threading eggshells onto a string, hundreds of shells long. Jack gently supports the unraveled part. 
Ma lets out a big yawn and discreetly rubs her aching jaw. 
OLD NICK (OVERLAPPING) Here we go again. You know instead of complaining maybe you should thank your lucky stars you've got a place like this. Cosy, safe, specially with the kid - no drunk drivers, drug-pushers, perverts... 
MA I'm sorry. 
OLD NICK Like pulling teeth sometimes. 
Ma waits for him to calm down. 
OLD NICK (CONT'D) Your problem is you have no idea about the world of today. 
MA No. 
OLD NICK Who pays the power bills? Who pays for everything? 
She gives the required answer. 
MA You. 
OLD NICK And where do you think the money's going to keep coming from? MA What do you mean? 
OLD NICK Nothing. 
MA No, but - 
OLD NICK (OVERLAPPING) Six months I've been laid off, have you had to worry your little head? 
Pause as Ma takes in the implications of this. She proceeds cautiously. 
(CONTINUED) 19   CONTINUED: (2)                                           19 
MA What are you going to do? 
He doesn't answer. 
MA (CONT'D) Are you... looking for another job? 
OLD NICK (OVERLAPPING) What job? There are no damn jobs, Jesus Christ! 
Jack, frightened, shrinks back in the wardrobe knocking into the back panel. Old Nick turns his attention to the wardrobe. 
OLD NICK (CONT'D) Hey in there. 
MA He's asleep. 
OLD NICK Don't think so. You keep him in the closet all day as well as all night? Poor little freak has two heads or something? 
He roots in his jacket pockets and produces an already opened tube of hard candy. 
OLD NICK (CONT'D) Hey Jack. You like candy? Wanna come out and have some candy? 
Jack, tempted, reaches for the door... Desperate to distract Old Nick, Ma touches his arm. 
MA Let's go to bed. 
Old Nick chuckles at this unaccustomed seductiveness. 
MA (CONT'D) Now. 
OLD NICK Didn't your Momma ever teach you manners? 
MA Please. 
(CONTINUED) 19   CONTINUED: (3)                                             19 
Pocketing the candy, he wraps himself round her. 
They edge backwards out of view. 
The lamp snaps off. 
20   INT. ROOM - WARDROBE - NIGHT                               20 
A little later, everything is quiet.   Moonlight. 
Jack, asleep in a crooked position, wakes with a jump. He sits up and rubs his neck. Finds his truck. He opens the door and peeks out. Where's the candy? 
21   INT. ROOM - NIGHT                                          21 
Stepping out, holding his truck for moral support, Jack stumbles into something and gasps. He picks it up: a thick leather belt, like a cobra. 
(CONTINUED) 21   CONTINUED:                                                  21 
He takes another few steps and stubs his toe on a huge boot. 
Jack stares at Old Nick, asleep in the middle of the bed. 
Ma is sleeping too, clinging to the far side. 
Now he's come this far, Jack forgets the candy, fascinated by Old Nick, whom he's seeing up close for the first time. 
Jack puts his finger out, almost touching Old Nick's face. 
Old Nick's eyes open, startled.   Then he grins. 
OLD NICK Hey sonny. 
JACK No Sunday Treat? 
MA No anything. 
Jack tries the bean again - then spits it out quietly. Ma watches him, kisses him, forces herself to begin telling him the truth. 
MA (CONT'D) Hey Jack. Remember the mouse? 
JACK My friend Mouse? 
MA You know where he is right now? 
Jack looks all around Room. 
MA (CONT'D) On the other side of this wall. 
Jack stares hard at the wall. 
JACK What other side? 
MA Oh Jack, everything has two sides. 
JACK Not an octagon. 
MA No, that's - 
(CONTINUED) 25   CONTINUED: (2)                                          25 
JACK (OVERLAPPING) An octagon has eight. 
Ma holds up her hand flat. 
MA But a wall's like this. And we're on the inside, in Room, and Mouse is on the outside, see? 
JACK In Outer Space? 
MA No, in the world.   It's much closer than Outer Space. 
She shows him the distance with her hands. 
JACK (OVERLAPPING) I don't see any outside side. 
MA But if we were outside in the world, we would, we'd be looking at the other side of this wall, and Mouse lying in the grass with his Ma. We'd see trees and cars and - 
JACK (OVERLAPPING) Grass is just TV. 
MA Is it, though? You know when Door opens and the air comes in, the air that smells fresher - that's grass. Jack tries to laugh. 
JACK You can't smell TV. 
MA But it's not TV. It's the real world we smell. You're so smart, I know you've started wondering. 
(CONTINUED) 25   CONTINUED: (3)                                           25 
Jack shakes his head. 
MA (CONT'D) Where do you think Old Nick gets our food? 
JACK From TV by magic. 
MA There's no magic! Everything we see on TV - it's pictures of real stuff and real people in the world. 
JACK Dora's real for real? 
MA No, sorry, not Dora, she's just a picture, but the other ones, with faces like ours - and there's real streets and oceans, dogs, cats - 
JACK (OVERLAPPING) No way. Where would they all fit? 
MA Just out there, in the world. 
Jack, tired of this, changes the subject. 
JACK Can I have a sandwich? 
Controlling her exasperation, Ma gets out a half slice of bread and adds a rationed scraping of peanut butter. She sets down his food and he comes to the table to eat it. 
(CONTINUED) 25   CONTINUED: (4)                                              25 
Ma stands with her hands in her armpits to warm them. She stares around as if for proof. Cranes up at the skylight. 
MA Look! A leaf! 
JACK Where? 
MA On skylight. 
She climbs up on a chair and lifts Jack onto her shoulders so he can see. His head is close to the recessed skylight. He looks at a brown, sodden half-rotted leaf. 
JACK Dumbo Ma. That's not a leaf. Leaves are green. 
MA On the trees they are but when they fall they rot, like salad, in the fridge, they -. 
JACK (interrupting) Where's all the stuff you said? Trees and dogs and - 
MA (OVERLAPPING) Well, we can't see them from here because the skylight looks upwards instead of sideways. 
Later. Jack is back on the bed, his face red. Ma holds a cloth wrung out with hot water over his forehead. 
JACK Ow! 
MA You need to feel hot when he touches you. 
Jack starts crying at the prospect. Ma strokes him as she presses the bag to his forehead. 
MA (CONT'D) Crying's good, it makes you look sicker. 
Then she moves the bag to each cheek in turn. 
MA (CONT'D) And stay floppy, remember? You're too weak to move or say a word. 
(CONTINUED) 31   CONTINUED:                                                  31 
She shoves her fingers down her throat to make her retch. 
JACK What are you doing? 
Ma manges to vomit a little. 
She rubs it on the pillow beside Jack, which horrifies him. 
MA Makes you smell sick. 
Ma checks her watch, and presses the cloth to his face. 
MA (CONT'D) Remember when you get to the hospital you give them the note. Show me how you hold it out. 
Jack fumbles in his pocket for the edge of the note. Something falls out with it. 
MA (CONT'D) What's that. 
She picks it up. Her bad tooth. She gives it back to him. 
MA (CONT'D) See, that's a bit of me you have with you all the time. 
JACK I'm scared. 
Ma strokes his face. MA I know. 
(CONTINUED) 31   CONTINUED: (2)                                              31 
The door beeps, startling them both. 
Ma shoves the wet rag and the pot of hot water under the bed. Jack hides his red face in the pillow, goes limp. 
The door opens and Old Nick steps in with a grocery bag. 
MA (CONT'D) There you are! 
He scowls at her, and shoulders the door shut. 
OLD NICK You know the drill: not a peep out of you till the door's shut. 
MA Sorry, just - Jack's really bad. 
Old Nick puts the groceries down, grimacing at the smell. 
MA (CONT'D) It was so cold. 
OLD NICK You brought that on yourself. 
MA I couldn't keep him warm, and now he's burning. 
OLD NICK Give him one of those painkillers. 
MA I've tried, he pukes them back up. Old Nick comes up close to Jack. 
MA (CONT'D) Don't - 
He elbows her out of the way lays his hand across Jack's forehead. 
Jack lets out a whimper of fear that passes for pain. 
OLD NICK I'll get him something stronger. 
(CONTINUED) 31   CONTINUED: (3)                                            31 
MA He's only five! Dehydrated, temperature this high, he could go into convulsions any minute. 
OLD NICK (OVERLAPPING) Shut up and let me think. 
MA He needs antibiotics. 
OLD NICK I'll bring something tomorrow night. 
MA Tomorrow night? You have to take him to the ER right now. 
OLD NICK Enough with the hysterics. 
MA I'm begging you. Please! 
Old Nick taps the code into the keypad, hiding his hand. Ma clings to him. 
(CONTINUED) 33   CONTINUED: (4)                                             33 
She folds them across Jack's chest, elbows sticking out. 
(CONTINUED) 33   CONTINUED: (5)                                           33 
MA (O.S.) (CONT'D) There, Now push up your arms. 
JACK I can't. 
MA Push, Jack. 
His elbows scrape through and his fingers clasp hers. 
MA (CONT'D) Now roll. 
Jack makes a feeble try, barely moves. Pants, sobs. 
MA (CONT'D) OK. Take a breath. 
JACK Get me out. 
MA (O.S.) You're getting yourself out. 
JACK Out! 
MA (O.S.) If you panic, Old Nick will hear that you're alive, and he'll be mad. 
Jack groans. 
MA (O.S.) (CONT'D) I know you, Jack. I know you can do this. 
Jack clenches his teeth and starts to writhe and roll side to side. 
He rolls over face down, and gets his butt slightly in the air, bending the cylinder of the rug. 
He rolls the other way, sits up: the rug opens. He claws his way out, his face red and smeared. Ma is looking almost as distraught as him, but she grins. 
MA (CONT'D) You did it! You're the banana! 
(CONTINUED) 33   CONTINUED: (6)                                            33 
JACK I hate you. 
The first time he's ever said it: they're both shocked. 
MA That's OK. I brought you here to Room. I didn't mean to but I did, and I've always been so glad. And now it's my job to get you out. 
34   INT. ROOM - DUSK                                          34 
Later. Jack's lying half rolled in the rug. He's been waiting for hours. Ma crouches beside him drilling him in the plan. 
JACK Truck, wriggle out, Jump, Run - 
MA Wait till the truck slows down at the first stop sign - if you jump when it's going fast you might - 
She stops talking so as not to cry. Checks her watch. Stares at the door as if she can will it to open. 
MA (CONT'D) So Truck, Wriggle Out, Jump when it Slows Down... 
Jack struggles to remember the list. 
JACK Somebody, Run - MA Jump, Run, then shout to Somebody and show them the Note. 
Jack checks the for note in his pocket. 
MA (CONT'D) Tell them your Ma is Joy Newsome and ­ 
(CONTINUED) 34   CONTINUED:                                               34 
JACK Who is Somebody? 
MA Anybody - the first person you see. 
JACK An actual real person. 
Ma nods, worried by his lingering confusion. 
JACK (CONT'D) What if Old Nick unwraps me? 
MA He's not going to - 
Ma falters, puts her head in her hands. She collects herself. 
MA (CONT'D) You got Bad Tooth in your pocket? 
Jack points to his cheek. 
JACK It's in here so I don't lose it. 
Beat 
MA You're going to love it. 
JACK What? 
A pause - Jack senses a light going on nearby. Then the clang of a shovel being dropped onto the bed of truck beside the rug. 
Old Nick's footsteps, heading for the driver's seat. Sound of the truck rumbling to life. 36   EXT. STREET NEAR OLD NICK'S - DUSK                          36 
Sound and shaking: the truck roars along too fast. 
We're with Jack, stunned, face-down in the darkness. 
(CONTINUED) 36   CONTINUED:                                                  36 
At last he remembers that he's meant to be wriggling out. 
He writhes, but the rug has tightened in transit. 
With an effort, Jack manages to roll over. No better. 
The engine quietens as the truck slows. Jack is not sure if that's his signal and anyway he's still trapped in the rug. 
The truck doesn't stop at the stop sign, only slows. 
Jack remembers his arm. He forces it above his head, wincing as the rug scrapes the skin off his elbow. Jack puts all his misery into movement, thrashing about, kicking, jack-knifing like a dying fish. 
The truck's engine lulls as it makes a rolling stop. 
Jack feels the rug slide a little across the flatbed, which gives him just enough momentum that he bends, with a deep grunt, and the rug starts to roll open. 
He bursts out, on hands and knees: like a birth. Elbow and lip bloody, face covered in hair, snot and tears. 
The world hits Jack: street lamps, wind in his face, shocking colors of the sunset. Trees and houses looming and then receding, like a rollercoaster. 
His glance falls on the shovel meant for his grave. 
Jack's eyes focus on the cab of the truck and what he realizes must be the back of Old Nick's head, driving. 
Old Nick slows at the third stop, and swings right. Jack is flung headlong, banging his leg on the left of the flatbed. The truck screeches to a stop, because Old Nick heard the noise and glimpsed Jack in his rearview mirror. 
He flings the driver's door open. 
Jack scrabbles over to the opposite side. 
Old Nick jumps down and strides around the truck. 
Jack leaps down to the tarmac, bloodying his left knee. His jaw smashes into his right knee. He picks a direction at random and tears away from the truck, stumbles, keeps going. 
A large dog on a long leash, emerges from a yard. 
(CONTINUED) 36   CONTINUED: (2)                                            36 
DOUG(a big man in his forties) and his 2-year-old daughter CARRIE, both in winter outdoor clothes, follow. 
Jack runs into the man, finds himself on the ground with the dog snarling at him. 
DOUG Boomer! 
He pulls the dog away by the collar. 
Old Nick catches up, and scoops Jack up with one arm. 
Pinned in the air, Jack lashes out in soundless terror. Old Nick strides back towards the truck with him. 
DOUG (CONT'D) Excuse me? Hey. 
Old Nick puts Jack down but holds his shoulders. 
Jack cringes, eyes on the ground. 
DOUG (CONT'D) I'm so sorry. Is your little girl OK? 
OLD NICK It's under control. 
Doug stares at Jack's bloody knee, elbow, lip. 
DOUG She been in some kind of accident? You want me to call someone? OLD NICK I'll take care of it. 
Jack can't speak, but pulls out the note. Old Nick snatches it out of his hand, scrunching it. 
DOUG What's that you got there, honey? 
OLD NICK (OVERLAPPING) Why don't you mind your own business and I'll mind mine? 
DOUG OK, I don't like this. 
(CONTINUED) 36   CONTINUED: (3)          36 
(CONTINUED) 36   CONTINUED: (4)                                              36 
He pulls out his cellphone and dials. Old Nick picks up Jack again and hurries to his truck. 
Doug waits impatiently for the emergency operator. 
DOUG (shouts after Old Nick) I've got your plates, mister! K93 - 
Old Nick drops Jack in the street and breaks into a run. 
DOUG(CONT'D) Hey! Hey! 
OFFICER PARKER Is there another name, after Joy. 
Jack struggles but can't remember `Newsome'. 
OFFICER PARKER (CONT'D) Where's your Mom right now? 
Jack suddenly realizes that Old Nick - furious because Jack's alive and has escaped - might be heading back to hurt her. 
JACK Room. 
OFFICER PARKER What room? Where's the room? 
JACK Not on any map. 
Officer Parker's questions come faster as her concern grows. 
OFFICER PARKER The man with the truck, that your dad? Ma's boyfriend? You know him? 
JACK Old Nick. 
OFFICER GRABOWSKI Speak up! 
Officer Parker glares at him: he's not helping. 
JACK (louder) Old Nick. But that's not his name. 
OFFICER PARKER Did this Nick guy hurt you? 
She goes to touch his lip, but he flinches away. 
JACK I bit me by accident. And the, the, the - 
He pats the ground to remember the word. 
JACK (CONT'D) The hard of the street. I jumped and smasheded my knee. 
(CONTINUED) 37   CONTINUED: (4)                                           37 
He remembers Bad Tooth and takes it out of his mouth. 
OFFICER PARKER What's that, Jack? 
JACK A bit of Ma. 
Both officers peer at Bad Tooth, and exchange a dark look. 
38   INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT                                      38 
Inside the moving police car. Jack's head jerks as he tries to make sense of the passing images. He flinches as a car passes in the other direction. Bewildering signs: YIELD, HIDDEN DRIVEWAY. 
OFFICER PARKER So, Jack? You see anything? 
JACK Everything. 
(CONTINUED) 38   CONTINUED:                                                  38 
OFFICER PARKER No, but anything you recognise? Your room, Jack, is it in a bungalow - all one level? Or stairs? What's outside the room? 
JACK Space. (corrects himself) The world. 
He plucks at the seat belt, which is too high for him and pressing uncomfortably on his neck. 
OFFICER GRABOWSKI You reckon the kid's on something? 
OFFICER PARKER Jack, when you step out the door - 
Jack shakes his head anxiously. 
OFFICER PARKER (CONT'D) You don't like to go outside? 
JACK We don't know to open the door. 
OFFICER GRABOWSKI My money's on some kind of cult. The tooth, the long hair... 
OFFICER PARKER Is there daylight in your room? 
Jack nods. OFFICER PARKER (CONT'D) How many windows? 
JACK Zero. 
He makes a circle with his finger so she'll understand. 
(CONTINUED) 38   CONTINUED: (2)                                         38 
OFFICER PARKER Then how does the sun come in? 
JACK Through Skylight. 
OFFICER PARKER Excellent. (on her walkie-talkie) Check the satellite. Sounds like his mother's being held in a house with a skylight. 
OFFICER GRABOWSKI Needle in a haystack... 
JACK (OVERLAPPING) Room's not a house. 
OFFICER PARKER OK. 
Next morning. A bright hospital room. Jack and Ma share the fancy hospital bed. A cot bed, unused, has been set up to one side. Jack is awake but content to lie close to Ma for a while - studying the dials and switches on the wall above his head. He looks at Ma, asleep, bruises fading to yellow-green. He sits up and pulls back the sheet. He's wearing only a pair of underpants from Room which look particularly wretched in this new antiseptic environment. He touches the part of the mattress he's being lying on. It's damp. He examines a bandage on his knee. He gets up. On a side table, he sees a plate with the remains of some toast on it and a half drunk cup of tea. He sniffs at the food. There are two surgical masks there, also. He walks slowly to the opposite wall, his little figure silhouetted against the translucent blinds. He stops in front of the one window which has its blind drawn. The hospital suite is high up and the view is spectacular. 
(CONTINUED) 45   CONTINUED:                                               45 
From the back we study Jack's small figure and beyond it the vast world below. 
(CONTINUED) 45   CONTINUED: (2)                                           45 
Coming around on Jack's face we see that he is trying to make sense of what he's seeing. It takes him a moment to realize what he's looking at and how high above ground he is. His breathing quickens and he turns and scurries back to bed. 
He shakes his mom. 
JACK Ma. Ma. 
She begins to wake. 
MA Good morning sleepy head. I was waiting so long for you to wake I fell back asleep. 
JACK Is this another planet? 
MA Same one, just a different bit. It's a room - (hears the word) A bedroom in a hospital. 
Jack thinks about this. 
JACK Are we sick for real or pretend? 
MA We're not sick. We're the opposite of sick. 
Beat. JACK How long are we staying? 
MA Not long. Grandma saw us last night and she'll take us when they say we're OK. 
JACK And Grandpa. 
MA He was away at work but he's getting on a plane to come home. 
(CONTINUED) 45   CONTINUED: (3)                                     45 
Beat. 
JACK I wetted the bed ... before. I'm sorry. 
(CONTINUED) 45    CONTINUED: (4)                                              45 
MA That's OK. 
The bedside phone bursts to life, frightening Jack. Ma picks it up. 
MA (CONT'D (CONT'D) Yes, just now. OK ... if that's OK, thank you. 
Ma hangs up as Jack starts tugging the sheets off the bed. She stops him. 
MA (CONT'D) Don't worry about that. Someone will wash it. Come on, we have to get ready. 
Ma steps out of bed. She's wearing a robe. It says `Tyler Forest Hospital' 
JACK What's that? 
MA Do you like it? There's one for you, too. 
She picks up a robe from beside the bed, puts him in it - it's way too big, then she begins to take off his damp underpants. 
45A   INT. HOSPITAL - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS                       45A 
Ma and Jack come into the bathroom. Ma throws Jack's underpants in the trash. 
JACK That's waste. 
MA We'll get new ones. 
JACK For Sunday Treat? 
MA There are going to be so many treats, not just on Sundays. 
Jack looks around. 
(CONTINUED) 45A   CONTINUED:                                              45A 
JACK Where's the bath. 
MA It's a shower instead.   Splashier. 
Ma notices a large mirror. This is the first time she's seen herself properly in 7 years. She studies herself - bares her teeth. She points out their reflections to Jack. 
(CONTINUED) 45A   CONTINUED: (2)                                          45A 
MA (CONT'D) Jack, look. It's us. 
This is the first time Jack has ever properly seen himself. 
JACK Ma, will he find us. 
MA No, he will never, ever come again. 46   INT. HOSPITAL - MA AND JACK'S SUITE - BATHROOM - DAY      46 
Ma and Jack are in the shower. Jack is pressed to the door, as far away as possible from the powerful jet of water. 
VOICE (O.C.) Oh for God's sake ... 
DR. MITTAL We can talk about this again later. It sounds like you have more important things to do right now. 
The door opens and Nancy enters (we met her briefly in the emergency room) carrying an overnight bag. She is followed by a man in his sixties, rumpled from travel. This is ROBERT, Ma's father. 
MA Dad! 
ROBERT My darling. 
They hug, the masks are quickly discarded. Dr. Mittal watches from the back of the room. 
NANCY We couldn't wait any longer. 
(CONTINUED) 47   CONTINUED: (6)                                             47 
Jack, forgotten, is frightened by what he sees. He curls up. Eventually, Ma notices him. 
MA Jack, Jack it's OK. This is your Grandma and Grandpa. 
NANCY Hello, Jack. 
Jack hides his face. 
NANCY (CONT'D) That's OK. Thanks for saving my little girl, Jack. 
Robert tries to smile but he is very uneasy around Jack. Nancy lifts the small bag she brought. 
NANCY (CONT'D) I hope I didn't forget anything. I'm sure I did. 
48   EXT. HOSPITAL - UPPER STOREY TERRACE - DAY                 48 
Hospital roof garden. Jack sticks close to Ma. She is dressed in track-suit bottoms and her old warm winter coat. Jack has pajamas under his robe and a warm coat which doesn't quite fit. Ma has a pair of her old boots on, Jack has trainers. They wear tinted glasses against the brightness of the day. Jack is a strange sight, the part of his face not covered by his mask (the others are unmasked) or woollen hat is smeared in heavy sun screen. They sit with Robert and Nancy. Nancy smokes a slim cigarette. Jack watches her cigarette for a while, then his attention is snagged by a nurse pushing an old woman in a wheelchair. He is also fascinated by the sky reflected in the mirrored glass of the building. 
Ma runs her hand along her coat. 
NANCY (off Ma's clothes) I kept everything. 
Jack is finding his shoes - the first he's ever worn - irritating. He starts to take them off. 
(CONTINUED) 48   CONTINUED:                                          48 
MA Leave them, Jack, you'll get used to them. 
Pause. 
(CONTINUED) 48   CONTINUED: (2)                                            48 
ROBERT You're here. 
They hug again. Letting go at last they smile at each other for a long moment. We feel a history of great closeness between them. Ma wipes away her tears. 
MA So, what's in Michigan? 
Robert and Nancy exchange glances. 
MA (CONT'D) (sensing something) OK. 
She waits. 
ROBERT I'm working out of the Grand Rapids office. 
Beat. 
ROBERT (CONT'D) I live there now. 
NANCY Oh, Sweetie... There have been a lot of changes in our lives since you've been gone. Your dad and I... losing you, was very hard on us. And he and I... 
ROBERT We had to go our different ways. It was what we had to do. 
Jack doesn't understand any of this but hates the tension. 
MA Whoa. This is not what I thought was happening. 
NANCY Your father felt we had to accept that you were... 
She stops herself. Robert suppresses his anger. 
ROBERT People deal with things in their own way. 
(CONTINUED) 48   CONTINUED: (3)                                       48 
NANCY I knew you'd come home one day. 
They sit. 
MA Wow. 
(CONTINUED) 48   CONTINUED: (4)                                        48 
NANCY I'm so sorry, I didn't know how to tell you. They said we should talk to you together. 
Nancy is upset. 
ROBERT The Doctor mentioned this other place where they could help you, because it's hard, you know, to suddenly - 
53   INT. CLINIC - FOYER - DAY                                 53 
Ma, Jack (masked, with sunglasses on), Nancy and Robert move towards the doors of the hospital where the Resident FBI agent waits for them. Robert is carrying the small bag that contains all of Ma and Jack's possessions. 
Ma puts her sunglasses on as they go through the doors. 
DR. MITTAL You have your schedule of appointments, and your medications. Please completely finish the course of antibiotics. 
MA I understand. 
DR. MITTAL You have my number. 
MA Got it. DR. MITTAL If you need anything, if you just want to talk, you use it, alright? 
Ma nods. 
They pause at the doors until they're beckoned by FBI agents. 
(CONTINUED) 53   CONTINUED:                                                53 
Ma accompanies Jack through the door. 
54   EXT. CLINIC - DRIVEWAY - DAY                                 54 
POLICE and HOSPITAL SECURITY are outside along with FBI agents, a VICTIM LIASON person and Ma's LAWYER. 
As Jack again takes in the scale of the outside world the adults get caught in the logistics of who goes in which car, who will take Ma's bag, what will happen at the other end of the journey. Jack observes the little clusters of people with their overlapping voices raised in clarification, reassurance... 
Ma and Jack are led to one of the waiting cars. Jack bumps his head getting in. 
We watch the convoy pulling away from the hospital and out into the world. 
55   INT. FBI CAR - DAY                                           55 
A little later. Driving through a better, neater neighborhood than Old Nick's. 
Jack grips Ma's hand, watches the world pass. 
JACK (V.O.) I've been in the world nineteen hours. I've seen pancakes and stairs and a cat and windows and hundreds of cars and birds and police and doctors and Grandma and Grandpa, and persons with different faces and bigness and smells talking all at the same time. The world's like all TV planets on at the same time so I don't know which what to look and listen. Doors and doors and behind all the door there's another inside and another outside and things happen-happen- happening, it never stops. Plus the world's always changing brightness and hotness and there's invisible germs floating everywhere. When I was small I only knew small things but now I'm five I know everything. 
(CONTINUED) 55   CONTINUED:                                               55 
She takes his mask off over his head. 
56   INT. FBI CAR - LATER                                         56 
They turn onto a residential street of low houses and well- groomed lawns. 
It's all familiar to Ma yet utterly strange: a crowd of media (national and international) is set up across the road from her house behind temporary barricades. There are neighbors and well-wishers carrying helium balloons, flowers, toys, and signs. POLICE keep order. 
MA (under her breath) Jesus. 
Ma tidies her hair. 
Nancy, Robert and a LAWYER emerge from the first car. Nancy manages an apologetic smile and half-wave to the neighbors who are watching from their own yards. 
RESIDENT AGENT leans in the driver's window to address Ma. 
RESIDENT AGENT Ready for this? 
Ma adjusts her shades and undoes her belt and Jack's. 
MA (to Jack) Ready? 
JACK Steady - go. 
They climb out, heads down, shielded by FBI agents. Jack stumbles, almost falls. Now they're outside they can hear a news helicopter overhead: it sounds like a war zone. Nancy joins them, taking Jack's hand, and they rush for the front door. 
REPORTER 1 Joy! Joy! Any message for your well- wishers? What's it like to be home? 
(CONTINUED) 56   CONTINUED:                                               56 
REPORTER 2 Jack! Jack! Look this way. 
REPORTER 3 Jack! How do you like the world so far? 
RESIDENT AGENT You're doing great. 
REPORTER 2 Joy! What do you say to your captor? 
Robert and the Lawyer approach the cluster of reporters being held back by the Police. 
LAWYER At this time ... excuse me, please ... at this time I will read a brief statement from the family after which I would ask you to respect their privacy. I'm sure you can understand this is a very - 
Nancy, Ma and Jack step into ... 
57   INT. NANCY AND LEO'S HOUSE - HALL - DAY                      57 
The hallway of Nancy and Leo's house. The Resident Agent is with them. 
RESIDENT AGENT The back of the property is well screened, and we've added to that where necessary, so if you keep these drapes closed you'll have complete privacy. We'll be right outside if there's anything at all you need. 
NANCY Thank you. Thank you so much. 
The Resident Agent leaves. Nancy, Ma and Jack stand in the stillness. Curtains drawn, lights on. 
LEO Sure. 
NANCY (to Ma) Is there anything you'd like, or like to do? 
(CONTINUED) 57   CONTINUED: (6)                                            57 
MA Just rest. 
NANCY Sure. 
Ma and Jack move towards the stairs. Ma carries a small bag with their belongings. Nancy follows. At the foot of the stairs Jack stops. He's never had to climb stairs before. Ma shows him how to grip the rail and he starts up. 
58   INT. NANCY AND LEO'S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER 
Reaching the top of the stairs, they walk the quiet, carpeted hallway. Jack takes it all in. 
59   INT. NANCY AND LEO'S HOUSE - MA'S OLD ROOM - DAY             59 
Ma and Jack enter Ma's room. They absorb the decor of Ma's adolescence - preserved by her mother. 
NANCY This is your Mom's room, Jack. 
Jack looks around. He pulls a strand of his long hair out of his eyes. 
NANCY (CONT'D) Hey, maybe tomorrow we can cut that hair. What do you say, Jack? 
Jack shakes his head. Whispers to Ma. 
MA Jack says that's where his `strong' is. 
NANCY Ah ha. 
(CONTINUED) 59   CONTINUED:                                               59 
Jack walks over to the bed and sits down. We are with him as he takes in the band posters, track trophies, pictures - including pictures of his Mom as a young, happy girl. In the background Nancy and Ma watch him. 
NANCY (CONT'D) I'll let you rest. We'll be downstairs. 
Before she leaves, Nancy talks quietly, insistently to Ma, we only catch fragments of what she's saying. 
(CONTINUED) 59   CONTINUED: (2)                                            59 
Conventional things, promising she is there, that there's nothing Ma can't say to her, how much she loves her. Ma is quiet, a little shell-shocked. Nancy leaves. 
Struck by the sight of her music keyboard, Ma tries it: dead. She kneels down, finds the plug and puts it in the outlet. 
MA You didn't know I could play piano. Guess this tune... 
But after a few notes of 'Home on the Range'/'Big Rock Candy Mountain' she stumbles. Tries again, and messes it up. Stretches her stiff hand. Then she sits on the bed, suddenly limp. Checks her watch. It's gone; an old habit. Both Ma and Jack are subdued. 
JACK How long do we have to stay here? 
She takes out her bag of meds. 
MA (getting the tablets she needs) We live here now. 
She swallows her antibiotics and painkillers without water. She lies down. We stay on Jack's face as he continues to take in his surroundings and digest what Ma has said. After a little while he lies beside her and lifts her shirt so he can snuggle up and breastfeed. 
We repeat a sequence of shots from life before their escape ending in a mother & child portrait. In the little bedroom, they could be in Room. 
60   INT. NANCY AND LEO'S HOUSE - KITCHEN / DINING ROOM - NIGHT 60 
Ma, with Jack pressed close to her, sits at the dining table with Nancy, Robert and Leo. Desert. Jack is eating his first bowl of ice-cream. He takes a big mouthful and holds his hand to his head. He tugs at Ma and she leans down so he can whisper to her. 
JACK (whispering to Ma) Ice cream hurts. 
LEO You got a brain freeze there, Jack? 
(CONTINUED) 60   CONTINUED:                                               60 
MA Eat it slower. 
Small talk as food is passed around. Ma puts her fork down, she is beginning to get upset. Nancy watches her, puts a hand on hers. After a little while Ma calms. 
They eat quietly, the adults aware of the complexity and strangeness of the situation. Jack, oblivious, chomps away at his ice-cream. Robert watches him. 
ROBERT I'm going to turn in. 
Beat. 
MA Is there something wrong? 
ROBERT No. 
MA Why are you in such a hurry? 
(CONTINUED) 60   CONTINUED: (2)                                           60 
ROBERT It's been a long day. 
Beat. 
MA You haven't said one word to Jack. 
Unlike Ma, Nancy hasn't put two and two together about Robert's awkward bearing around Jack. 
Jack keeps drawing. 
63A   INT. NANCY'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                   63A 
Ma, Jack, Nancy and Leo eat supper, watching TV. Jack is drawn to look at Leo who does the old thumb trick for him. 
64    INT. NANCY AND LEO'S HOUSE - MA'S BEDROOM - MORNING          64 Ma is still asleep. Jack sits on the bed beside her, bored. He looks towards the half-open door to the landing. 
65    INT. NANCY AND LEO'S HOUSE - LANDING - DAY                   65 
Jack sits on the landing with a favorite toy from the pile in the sitting room. From where he sits he can see the open door to his and Ma's bedroom. It's dark inside. Eventually, Leo walks into view with a male DETECTIVE and a female VICTIM LIASON OFFICER. He shows them to the door. 
LEO Thank you again. 
(CONTINUED) 65   CONTINUED:                                                  65 
He lets them out, closes the door behind them, then peeps through the closed curtains. As he turns away, he spots Jack, gives him a salute and then busies himself in ways calculated to raise the interest of a 5-year-old. Tidying up, he picks up a ball from the floor, spins it on his finger, bounces it. Wanders off out of view, whistling, muttering about how particularly bouncy this ball is, etc. 
Jack starts down the stairs. He goes down on his backside not yet confident enough to do it standing. 
66   INT. LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN - MORNING                           66 
Jack wanders cautiously into the brightness of the living room, finding Leo who smiles at him, then gets back to whatever he's pretending to be doing. 
Jack is silent. 
LEO (to himself) Gee, am I hungry. 
He pads into the kitchen. 
LEO (CONT'D) Let's see what we have here. 
Jack follows him in. Leo takes some cereal out of a well stocked cupboard, he opens the fridge for milk. Jack takes in all the produce it contains. 
67   INT. KITCHEN - A MINUTE LATER                                67 Jack and Leo, at opposite ends of the counter, eat cereal. 
LEO Pretty good, right? 
Jack nods. 
LEO (CONT'D) I like this kind, too. Kind of sweet, but pretty good. 
Jack looks at Leo, not answering, but not bolting. He keeps eating. After a moment. 
JACK You have a dog? 
(CONTINUED) 67   CONTINUED:                                               67 
This is the first time Jack has initiated any conversation with an adult other than Ma. 
(CONTINUED) 67   CONTINUED: (2)                                              67 
LEO I do. Named Seamus. He's very small. Not very smart. You'll have to meet him sometime. He'll shake your hand. 
JACK I had a dog called Lucky. But he's not real. 
LEO Yeah? 
JACK In Room. 
Leo takes this in. 
LEO You ever play catch, Jack? 
68   EXT. BACK YARD - LATER                                       68 
Jack and Leo walk out into the garden. Jack is wearing his hat and glasses but no sun-cream. 
The back yard is a simple rectangle of grass bounded by barkdust and shrubbery with a few small trees. But to Jack it is a new cosmos. He wanders tentatively into the open space. Jack kneels to investigate the dirt and grass. He smells deeply. 
A little later, Leo and Jack throw the ball between them. Jack's shoes are irritating him. JACK I hate shoes. 
LEO I hear what you're saying, but ... 
Leo drops the ball and kicks it to Jack who manages to kick it back. 
LEO (CONT'D) They've got their uses. Am I right? 
Jack nods. They play awhile, getting farther apart. 
(CONTINUED) 68   CONTINUED:                                               68 
NEIGHBOR BOY (OS) Hey. 
Jack and Leo look over. The NEIGHBOR BOY is standing at the fence. 
NEIGHBOR BOY (CONT'D) I have a ball like that. 
LEO (wary, but open) No kidding. It's a nice ball, isn't it? 
NEIGHBOR BOY I got mine for my birthday. 
LEO Fantastic. You hear that, Jack? He got this same ball for his birthday. 
NEIGHBOR BOY Why's he wearing those glasses. 
We enter with Jack to find Nancy, Leo and Ma. Ma and Nancy are hugging. The lawyer is on speaker phone. 
(CONTINUED) 75   CONTINUED:                                               75 
LEO Not at all, we'll all sleep better. 
LAWYER (SPEAKER) I thought you'd want to know. 
LEO That's right 
LAWYER It's a good day. 
NANCY Thank God. 
JACK You were gone! 
Ma turns. She's been crying but she comes over to Jack smiling broadly. She kneels so her face is level with his. 
MA Do you want to hear something really good? 
In the background Leo ends the call. 
JACK You were gone. 
MA Hey listen. Old Nick is going to jail for a really long time. 
JACK I know Old Nick is in jail. MA But now he'll be there for ever and ever. And I don't have to see him ever again or talk to the judge or any of those scary things. Isn't that great? 
Jack nods, not really understanding. 
MA (CONT'D) We can stop worrying now and start to do all the things we want. 
She picks him up and hugs him. 76    INT. NANCY AND LEO'S KITCHEN - DAY                           76 
Ma is on her phone, furiously texting. Jack watches. He's bored. Just the sound of tapping thumbs. 
JACK What are you doing? 
MA I'm talking to people. 
She keeps texting, not explaining further. 
77    INT. MA'S OLD BEDROOM - DAY                                  77 
Jack sits on the bed, watching Ma at her dressing table.    She is smartly dressed, her hair is fixed nicely. 
JACK Why do you look like that? 
MA I'm dressed to go out, that's all. 
He watches MA force earrings through the healed piercings in her ears. It looks painful. 
JACK I don't like it. 
MA It's just some clothes and makeup. 
77A   INT. NANCY'S HOUSE - STAIRS - MOMENTS LATER                 77A 
Jack follows Ma downstairs. 
MA Come on, we need to get you ready. 
We follow them into ... 
77B   INT. NANCY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN                                77B 
Nancy cleans up in the kitchen. Ma and Jack come in. Ma finds the sunscreen and starts to apply it.

NANCY Maybe it's too much for him right now. 
MA It's not too much for me. I need to go out, get some air. 
Ma starts to apply sunscreen to Jack. 
MA (CONT'D) (to Nancy) You could have a better attitude, you know. 
With some effort, Nancy holds her tongue. 
MA (CONT'D) You could support me in this. That's all I'm asking. I'm trying to take a step. 
NANCY You don't have to do it so soon. You could wait and we could go together. 
Ma wipes her hands, dials a number on her phone.

79    EXT/INT. STREET/LAURA'S CAR - DAY                         79 
A car is waiting. Inside, a young woman smiles and waves. Ma - holding a booster seat - cracks the door. 
MA Oh my God! 
The girls cart Jack into the store among the hanging clothes and mirrors. 
They tear through the racks. Techno music throbs. The mannequins leer. 
For a moment Jack loses track of the girls. The clothes are everywhere. 
JACK Ma! Ma! 
She reappears from behind a rack. 
MA I'm here. OK? Just calm down. 
JACK I was scared! 
MA (doing her best to be reassuring) Don't be. This is normal. This is what people do. 
JACK I don't like it! 
MA Remember your superpowers, alright, have fun. And no whining, OK? 
A clerk appears. 
CLERK Hi, there. Anything I can help you with? 
(CONTINUED) 84   CONTINUED:                                                  84 
MA I need some... (she looks around desperately)... some shoes. 
CLERK Great. Shoes are all over there. Just let me know if you need anything else, okay? 
Ma goes and stares at the shoe display. Many colors, many styles. She's paralysed. Jack is close beside her. 
MA I don't know. 
JACK Can we get Dylan now? 
MA Please, Jack. 
LAURA These ones are kind of cute. 
MA No. I definitely don't want any of these. I'd never wear these. 
She grabs Jack's hand and drags him out of the store. Laura follows looking weirded-out. 
85   INT. MALL - LATER                                           85 
The trio hurries through the mall. Ma looks nervous, Laura concerned, Jack bewildered and angry. MA (barely paying attention) Are you hungry, Jack? You want something in the food court? They've got, I don't know, pizza and stuff. 
JACK I want Dylan. You said. 
MA I said if you were good. 
LAURA I could run and get it for him. 
(CONTINUED) 85   CONTINUED:                                               85 
MA No. I said no, so he has to understand. 
They pass a Cinnabon outlet. 
MA (CONT'D) Jack, you want a Cinnabon? You smell that? 
JACK No. 
MA Cinnabon is good. You might like it. 
LAURA I think we should just go. 
JACK I want Dylan. I want Dylan now.You said. 
MA You are being really naughty Jack. 
Jack starts into a full on tantrum. 
MA (CONT'D) Suit yourself. 
She grabs him to carry him out, but he pulls away. All the noise has drawn the attention of the people around them. A couple of TEENAGERS approach Jack. TEENAGER (to Jack) Hey, are you that kid from the TV. 
MA Get the fuck away from him. Get the fuck away. 
86   INT. LAURA'S CAR - SOON                                      86 
Ma, Jack and Laura clamber into the car. 
LAURA Oh my God. Oh. My. God. 
(CONTINUED) 86   CONTINUED:                                                86 
MA Shit, shit, shit. Those assholes. 
LAURA Buckle up, Jack, all right? 
JACK I... I... 
He looks around, not knowing what to do. 
Jack stops eating halfway through a mouthful, can't swallow. 
103   INT. NANCY'S HOUSE - MA'S OLD ROOM - NIGHT                  103 
Night. Jack wakes, sensing himself alone. No Ma in the bed: he touches the mark her body's left. No Ma in the room. 
104   INT. NANCY'S HOUSE - LANDING - MOMENTS LATER                104 
Jack walks on tiptoe down the landing. 
The last door is the bathroom, and there's a crack of light. 
Jack taps very quietly on the door, remembering the rule. 
JACK Ma? 
He goes to the top of the stairs and considers descending. 
Then he creeps back to the bathroom, whispers a bit louder. 
JACK (CONT'D) Ma? 
(CONTINUED) 104   CONTINUED:                                                104 
He tries the handle, but the door opens only a few inches. Frightened he starts to bang on the door. 
JACK (CONT'D) (shouting) Ma! Ma! 
An adult torso, Leo's, comes into the frame, driving with full force against the door which gives a little. Jack puts his face to the gap and sees Ma's hair spread out on the floor. 
105   INT. NANCY'S HOUSE - LANDING - NIGHT                      105 
A little later. Jack gets glimpses of chaos: on the bathroom floor, TWO PARAMEDICS working on Ma (who responds just enough that we know she's not dead), Nancy in the bathroom doorway, Leo trying to calm her. 
But no sound.   It's as if Jack has been deafened by an explosion. 
Later: as Ma is carried out in the background, Jack sits on the floor. We push in on him; he is hypnotized by the flashing ambulance lights on the wall. 
106   INT. NANCY'S HOUSE - MA'S OLD ROOM - DAY                  106 
JACK (V.O.) There's so much of place in the world, there's less time because the time has to be spread extra thin over all the places like butter, so all the persons say hurry up, let's get going, pick up the pace, finish up now. Ma was in a hurry to go boing up to heaven but she forgot me, Dumbo Ma, so the aliens threw her back down craaaaaaaash and broke her. 
Next morning. Jack in a ball on the bed. He opens his fist; Bad Tooth, all he has of Ma. 
In the background we hear the phone ringing. 
LEO (O.S.) (from hallway) Hello? (pause) Jack, come here. It's for you. 107   INT. NANCY AND LEO'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS          107 
Jack arrives. Leo holds out the phone. A pause then Jack takes it, holds it too far away: his first call. 
NANCY (FILTERED) Hi, Jack. I've got someone who wants to talk to you... 
MA (FILTERED) Is he there? Put him on. 
LEO He's on. He's waiting. 
MA (FILTERED) Jack? 
JACK Ma? 
She struggles to get control of her voice. 
MA (FILTERED) Are you doing OK? 
Jack is stumped by this question. 
JACK Come back. 
MA (FILTERED) What's that? 
JACK (louder) Come back now. 
MA (FILTERED) I wish I could. I just need to - 
JACK (OVERLAPPING) I pick. I pick for both of us. 
(CONTINUED) 107     CONTINUED:                                              107 
Ma breaks down in sobs. 
Jack hands the phone to Leo who talks to Nancy in murmurs. 
107A    INT. MA'S OLD BEDROOM - CUBBYHOLE - EVENING             107A 
Jack sits in the space under the roof in Ma's bedroom playing with Lego. 
107B    INT. NANCY'S HOUSE - LOUNGE - NIGHT                     107B 
Jack watches TV with Nancy and Leo 
107C    OMITTED                                                 107C 
107D    INT. NANCY'S HOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS VARIOUS                 107D 
Jack mopes around the house. Nancy and Leo give him space. 
NANCY I can help you if you'd like. 
JACK That would be great. 
(CONTINUED) 113   CONTINUED:                                                113 
NANCY Okay. Let's do this right. I've wanted to cut that hair a very long time. 
114   INT. NANCY'S KITCHEN - LATER                               114 
Jack sits in a chair with a sheet around his neck. 
Nancy clips his hair. 
NANCY I used to cut your mother's hair all the time. And your Grandpa's hair. I've still got it. 
JACK You think this will work? Can my strong be her strong too? I'm not really sure if it works that way. 
NANCY Of course it does. We all help each other stay strong. No one is strong alone. You and your mom, you help each other through, don't you? 
JACK Yes. 
NANCY And you and me. And you and Leo. And Leo and me. We all have the same strong. 
(CONTINUED) 114   CONTINUED:                                              114 
JACK I guess we do. 
NANCY Ok, here goes. 
Jack closes his eyes as Nancy cuts off his pony tail. 
115   INT. BATHROOM                                            115 
Jack is leaning his head back on the round lip of the bathroom sink. She turns on the water. 
NANCY Now lean back. 
The water is nicely warm now. 
NANCY (CONT'D) This is the best part. 
She pours water over his head, and shampoos him. 
NANCY (CONT'D) Feels good, doesn't it? 
He closes his eyes and nods. She pours more water. And more. His face is rosy with the heat. 
JACK I love you, Grandma. 
NANCY I love you, Jack. 116   INT. NANCY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY                         116 
Jack is drawing a multicolored picture. 
He uses all the colors of the crayon box. 
The picture of a house grows in colors and dimensions. The door is green. The windows orange. The roof red. 
117   EXT. NANCY AND LEO'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY               117 
Jack plays with the Neighbor Boy and Seamus in the garden. He hears a tap tap tap and looks round. Ma is watching him through the glass back door. He runs to her as she opens the door. They greet each other with nervous joy, without words. 
118   INT. NANCY AND LEO'S HOUSE - MA'S BEDROOM - SOON           118 
Jack and Ma sit beside each other on the bed. 
MA I'm sorry, Jack. 
JACK That's OK. 
He thinks. 
JACK (CONT'D) Don't do it again. 
MA I promise. JACK Are you better now? 
MA Starting to be. 
She strokes his short hair then reaches into her bag and takes out his ponytail. 
MA (CONT'D) I'll always keep this with me, Jack. (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 118   CONTINUED:                                              118 MA (CONT'D) I will never, ever let it go. When Grandma brought it to me, I... I knew I could get well. You saved me. Again. 
They sit placidly a moment. He reaches for her shirt. 
JACK Can I...? 
MA Sorry. There's none left. 
Jack think for a bit, accepts the new situation. 
JACK OK. 
MA I'm not a good enough Ma.

"God is at the bottom of the sea and I dive to find him." 
Enzo Maiorca 
FADE IN: 
EXT.  GREEK ISLAND - SUNSET 
CREDIT SEQUENCE: 
The image is in black and white. 
The sun disappears behind arid cliffs which cast giant shadows on the sea. 
A little boy around 8 years old -- tanned from head to toe -- sprints along the cliffs, scrambles from one rock to another with amazing agility. 
In one hand, he carries a transparent plastic bag.  In the other, a net bag containing flippers, mask, pants and sweater. 
The only thing that slows him down is his bathing suit -- obvious hand-me-downs -- way too big.  He tugs on them as he goes, holding them up... Until they slide again... as he leaps again... and pulls them up... 
The little boy is JACQUES MAYOL. 
End credits. 
EXT.  GREEK ISLAND - SUNSET 
JACQUES reaches a ledge jutting out over a deserted cove. 
He spits in his mask... expertly spreads the spit with a finger... locks his feet into the flippers... and dives. 
He surfaces a long way out... adjusts his mask... and swims away from shore. 
IN OPEN SEA 
The boy stops swimming -- starts to gulp air -- sucks it in -- oxygenating his blood in a series of deep rapid breaths -- almost hyperventilating, almost alarming if we've never seen this before. 
His gaze is glued to the ocean floor.  Clear clear water. 40 feet deep.  And intensely blue. 
Suddenly, he catches his breath and dives -- into the blue. 
UNDERWATER 
JACQUES touches bottom.  Clamps his legs around a rock to hold himself down.  Unhurried, thoroughly at home, 40 feet under... he opens the plastic bag.  A huge speckled moray eel appears in a hole in the rock, slithers toward him. The carnivore's jaws are bigger than the boy's head. 
The boy smiles at him.  Pulls a piece of raw meat out of his bag and holds it out.  The eel takes the morsel delicately -- and slithers back into his hole. 
Gravely, JACQUES takes another morsel out of the bag. 
EXT.  VILLAGE - DUSK 
JACQUES walks up a steep road bordering the port, almost dry now. 
Two boys about his age run up the streets; call out, catch up with him and gesture toward the port. 
THE BOYS Jacques!  Come quick! 
EXT.  PIER - DUSK 
The little boys tug JACQUES to the end of the pier and point to something in the water. 
BOYS Look!  Right there!  It's shining! 
JACQUES walks over, and sure enough sees something shining a few feet down in the water. 
JACQUES (squinting) A coin. 
FIRST BOY I found it. 
SECOND BOY Liar! 
Camera pans and we see a middle-aged PRIEST loading supplies into a small boat.  He stops to watch the children's negotiations.  Little JACQUES is putting his flippers on. 
JACQUES Ok.  I'll get it, but no fighting, all right? 
The two boys nod as they point to the coin. 
JACQUES We'll split it. 
FIRST BOY You can't split a coin.  That's stupid. 
ENZO (calmly undressing, expressionless) How did it happen? 
SUPERVISOR (upset) The company asked me to extract everything I could from the wreck; so the divers were trying to get at the engine... and then the boat turned over... in the current... and... look, I fucked up!  Can you help? 
ENZO How many are, down there? 
ENZO goes back to the car. 
SUPERVISOR Just one... We're feeding him air, but he's not breathing regularly... You've got to get him out fast. 
ENZO glances at the map, then at the accident site. 
ENZO (a beat) Ten thousand. 
SUPERVISOR Lira? 
ENZO Dollars. 
SUPERVISOR You're going to hold me up at a time like this? 
ROBERTO You do understand you're talking to the champion diver of the world? 
SUPERVISOR Yes, but ten thousand dollars... 
ENZO opens the trunk of his FIAT and pulls out the jack. He slams the trunk shut, and stands looking at the American, straight in the eyes. 
ENZO Okay.  You tell me.  How much would you say the man's life is worth? 
Extremely uncomfortable, the SUPERVISOR doesn't answer. 
ENZO In my village, we have a saying: when the wind blows, the flags of all nations flap in the same direction. 
SUPERVISOR (baffled) What does that mean? 
ROBERTO That you should get your checkbook. Damn quick. 
EXT.  UNFINISHED PIER - ENZO 
He's at the end of the pier, his feet dangling in the muddy water of the port.  A few feet away a pump sends air HISSING through a rubber tube to the diver trapped below. 
ENZO inhales steadily, his chest heaving like a bellow. He carefully puts his spectacles inside his shoes, dons his flippers, etc., with his usual flair of suspense. 
Behind him the SUPERVISOR and other construction workers watch expectantly.  ROBERTO heaves a stone weight into the bay, a cable attached to it plays out from a drum on the pier. 
ENZO ignoring everyone, grabs the ordinary tire jack, flip-flops over to the now taut cable, the stone has hit bottom.  He takes a deep breath and dives into the bay. 
UNDERWATER - WRECK 
ENZO dives down a chimney of muck.  Picks his way over and around every hazard, until he reaches the diver, trapped under a huge piece of debris. 
He pats his shoulder to comfort him, he then inserts the tire jack under a piece of concrete... And, as if he were changing a tire, begins to pump the handle... 
Slowly, in a swirl of mud and water, the chunk of debris rises off the diver's leg. 
EXT.  CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY 
Everyone is staring at the water silently, suspensefully. The SUPERVISOR has his checkbook in hand, but has completely forgotten it, intent upon what's going on underwater.  ROBERTO taps him on the shoulder. 
ROBERTO Since we have a little time, what do you say you write that check? 
UNDERWATER - WRECK 
ENZO cuts the cables tangled around the diver's torso. Then he takes off his flippers, plants his bare feet on the concrete, grabs the diver by the shoulders and pulls him free. 
The diver drops the air tube and climbs as quickly as possible toward the surface. 
EXT.  CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY 
The diver surfaces, gasping for breath.  A cheer goes up from the crowd.  Several men hurry to pull him onto dry land.  But there is no sign of ENZO.  Everyone waits, breathless. 
ROBERTO (to the Supervisor) Sign here. 
Suddenly, ENZO appears, burst out of the water, holding his flippers up in the air like a trophy.  The onlookers cheer, help him out of the water, slapping him on the back. 
ENZO tosses the jack and his flippers to ROBERTO. Impassive and silent, he slips his arms into the prize fighter's robe that ROBERTO holds out for him, walks solemnly back to his car. 
ROBERTO takes the check and walks over to the car.  ENZO bends down into the car and opens the roof. 
SUPERVISOR (through the open roof smiling) Thanks, thanks a lot.  I mean that too... You extortionist bastard! 
The car rushes off.  In the distance we see a police (carabinieri) car and an old fire engine rolling in the direction of the construction site. 
INSIDE FIAT - DRIVING AWAY 
ENZO'S car drives past them.  ENZO looks at ROBERTO out of the corner of his eye, then suddenly explodes with joy. 
ENZO Dollars, Roberto!  We took him for ten thousand dollars! 
ROBERTO whoops and whistles.  ENZO reaches over and leans on the horn.  The little car races by and finally stops at the top of the cliff facing the sea. 
EXT.  TOP OF CLIFF - DAY 
FRANK A drink to warm up? 
JOHANA Yes, thank you.  Intravenous if possible. 
FRANK (pulling out a flask) Tea... or whiskey? 
JOHANA ... both.  Did I just see a man in a red suit and goggles? 
FRANK smiles and pours some whiskey in her tea cup. 
FRANK ... right. (calling out) Dr. Lawrence?  The insurance man... uh... The insurance person is here! 
LAWRENCE It's about time! 
FRANK smiles and pours JOHANA some tea.  She warms her hands on the cup.  She asks blankly. 
JOHANA Would it be out of place to ask what he's doing? 
FRANK Who? 
JOHANA The guy in the Halloween suit! 
LAWRENCE comes in from the other side of the room. 
He walks straight over to the bay window. 
LAWRENCE Did you have a nice trip?  We were getting restless, it's been three weeks since the accident. 
JOHANA walks over to the bay window and starts staring at something in the distance. 
EXT.  DOCK - ON JACQUES 
At the end of the dock, JACQUES who is sitting on the edge of a hole which is cut in the ice, is putting a pair of gloves on.  He then grabs the handles of a strange machine which emerges from the water and starts taking deep breaths, oblivious to the cold, his mind completely elsewhere. 
BACK IN LAB 
JOHANA watches JACQUES.  She just can't believe her eyes. LAWRENCE is bent over one of his machines, fiddling with different switches. 
LAWRENCE (to Johana) You should get things moving, you know.  We're out of equipment and we can't do half of our experiments...! Frank, check the program! 
JOHANA is finally able to speak. 
JOHANA Who... Who is that? 
LAWRENCE Mayol... Jacques Mayol. 
JOHANA That's the experiment?  Dumping a guy into a frozen lake? 
LAWRENCE turns one last knob. 
LAWRENCE ... The truck fell into a very deep crevasse.  We weren't able to save the equipment. 
JOHANA I'll have to talk to the driver. 
LAWRENCE In the spring when he melts! 
JOHANA walks closer to the window.  She isn't hearing a thing he's saying. 
JACQUES is putting on his flippers. 
JOHANA can't believe it. 
JACQUES is standing by a hole cut in the ice.  He is holding onto the machine in the water.  He is waving a mask. 
JOHANA (dumbfounded) You really send him under the ice? He isn't a slave or a convict or anything? 
LAWRENCE My dear, science is a cruel mistress. 
JOHANA But... how is he going to breathe? 
LAWRENCE He isn't going to breathe. 
JACQUES takes a deep breath, turns a handle and a weight yanks him straight down into the water.  LAWRENCE sets his stop watch off and flips a few switches. 
JOHANA grabs his arm as if they could do something about it. 
LAWRENCE Listen... 
He raises the volume:  we hear the man's heartbeat through a small speaker. 
LAWRENCE That's his heartbeat. (excited) Can you hear the speed at which it's slowing down, it's incredible. 
LAWRENCE tears off the sheet with the heartbeat measures on it and hands it to JOHANA. 
JOHANA feels she's on the verge of crying, and can't figure it out. 
UNDERWATER - JACQUES 
JACQUES stops his machine by turning one of the handles. He's deep beneath the surface of the frozen lake.  He swims deliberately, carefully into a large tube which is hinged open.  He closes it around himself.  His heart is still slowing down.  He pushes a button on the machine, and a flash of light bursts in the opaque night surrounding him. 
BACK IN LAB - ON VIDEO SCREEN 
JACQUES You think I'd forget you? 
He laughs.  The driver, who seems to be quite familiar with the place, walks in heading straight over to the soda machine.  Out of the corner of his eye, he takes in the scene, very intrigued. 
JACQUES has not noticed him. 
He starts unwrapping the first package. 
JACQUES For Bathsheba. 
He produces a little ceramic Llama. 
ON BATHSHEBA 
looking at the llama, bewildered.  As bewildered as a dolphin can be.  JACQUES turns the llama upside down.  It moos:  HIAK, HIAK... 
JACQUES It's a Llama.  You understand?  From Peru.  It's fighting. 
BATHSHEBA shakes her head.  JACQUES throws the llama into the water.  He unwraps the second package.  A pair of Peruvian gloves and hat.  Wide eyed, the driver sits in the stands to watch the show. 
JACQUES That's for you, Darjeeling.  We wouldn't want you to catch cold! 
He throws them to DARJEELING who catches them. 
JACQUES And now... (singing out) "Ta, da..." For you Tina. 
He pulls out a thermos. 
JACQUES Something you've never seen either. 
He opens the thermos. 
JACQUES Snow! 
He sprinkles snow flakes on TINA'S head.  She tries to taste it. 
JACQUES (smiling like a child) A new experience, Tina. (nostalgic) I missed you little rascals.  Did you get my post card? 
The three dolphins leap into the air and land with a huge splash which soaks JACQUES.  He takes his shirt off. 
JACQUES (pretending to be serious) Oh?  Is that what you want? Alright, but five minutes, no more. I have a taxi waiting. 
He takes off his pants.  The taxi driver gets up, as if to keep him from going in.  JACQUES dives into the pool. 
UNDERWATER - ON JACQUES 
He swims under the dolphin, reaches out and grabs hold of the dolphin's snout. 
The dolphin pulls JACQUES around and around the basin while JACQUES pets his chest and belly.  We have never seen JACQUES so relaxed and happy. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT.  MANHATTAN - DAWN 
Overview of a gray and dirty Manhattan morning.  JOHANA depressed, stares blankly out of the window of a yellow cab.  She watches the muddy brown water flow under the Brooklyn Bridge. 
The driver keeps yelling obscenities to all the cars around him. 
EXT.  MANHATTAN - DAY 
A suitcase in each hand, JOHANA gets out of the cab and walks up the stairs of her apartment. 
INT.  HALLWAY - DAY 
JOHANA puts down her suitcase wearily.  Catches her breath and gets out her keys.  She tries one in the top lock.  It doesn't work.  She tries harder.  There's a woman's voice yelling angrily from inside the apartment. 
SALLY (O.S.) I changed the lock you son of a bitch! 
JOHANA ... Sally? 
The door opens. 
SALLY You're back!  Hello.  We were burgled. 
JOHANA Again? 
SALLY They got the new T.V. 
JOHANA comes in, looks at the ransacked apartment. 
SALLY ... And the new stereo. 
JOHANA I hope they remembered to take the microwave this time? 
SALLY Yep.  How was your trip...?  Help me clean up, okay? 
JOHANA You called the police? 
SALLY They're going to send detectives. When they get around to it. 
JOHANA (shrugging) So what, all they ever want is your phone number anyway. 
ENZO Because I'm sure you're dying to beat me. 
JACQUES (shaking his head) I don't want to be in any competition... I dive because I like to, not to beat a record... don't you have to be very mad at somebody to want to beat him? 
ENZO No.  All you need is to want to be the best. 
JACQUES (smiles) You're the best, Enzo! 
ENZO (with a tense grin on his face) That's too easy!  Every time I beat a record there's always some dumbshit asking me:  "D'you know that French guy, Mayol?  He's supposed to be very good!  Too bad he doesn't compete." So, you're going to come with me to Taormina! First, because you're my friend and second, because you don't have one reason to keep on spoiling my pleasure. (he pushes the airplane ticket to Jacques) ... I'll see you there... 
EXT.  OFFICE BUILDING - NEW YORK - DAY 
INT.  DUFFY'S OFFICE - DUFFY - JOHANA 
She is seated across the desk from him.  He's reading through her report.  Behind him, outside the large plate glass window, window-washers are seated on a scaffold suspended far above the city.  They eat lunch. 
JOHANA'S eyes wander (bored) around the office as DUFFY reads.  He looks up. 
DUFFY (indicating report) This is good work... unfortunately it's incomplete. (he glances at the window) Could you eat a sandwich 40 floors above the street. 
JOHANA (absently) What kind? 
DUFFY Johana, am I boring you? 
JOHANA Sorry.  Of course not, definitely not... well, maybe a little.  What did you say? 
DUFFY I said that the file is incomplete. See if you can get through to this Lawrence character and have him send the Peruvian registration for his missing truck... and don't let him tell you it was in the glove compartment. 
JOHANA Right Chief! 
She starts out of the office. 
DUFFY (to her back) Did the driver really freeze? 
JOHANA Like a popsicle.  They're keeping him on a stick until spring. 
DUFFY My God!  I'm glad I didn't go. 
JOHANA (under her breath, leaving) ... So am I. 
INT.  QUONSET HUT - PERU - DAY 
Doctor LAWRENCE covers one ear with his hand as he yells into the phone. 
LAWRENCE (screaming) ... I said, all the truck papers are in the glove compartment! 
INT.  JOHANA'S OFFICE - MANHATTAN 
JOHANA sits at her desk, she too is yelling into the telephone.  Her colleague looks over at her and smiles. 
JOHANA (with a sigh) Okay, listen, just get the custom's office to send me a copy as fast as possible.  We can't send you new equipment until our file is complete.  Okay? 
INT.  QUONSET HUT - PERU - DAY 
LAWRENCE Okay, okay.  You'll have it by the end of the week, how's that? 
JOHANA (V.O.) You've made me a happy insurance person. 
LAWRENCE Then, goodbye. 
He is just about to hang up. 
INT.  JOHANA'S OFFICE - MANHATTAN 
JOHANA jumps up. 
JOHANA Wait!  Professor...? 
LAWRENCE (V.O.) ... Yes? 
JOHANA starts snooping around the papers on her desk, embarrassed by the presence of her colleague. 
JOHANA (as softly as possible) You don't know how I could reach that diver of yours... Mayol... We need some additional information... I mean, we have a few questions to ask him. 
INT.  QUONSET HUT - PERU - DAY 
LAWRENCE The last thing I heard, he was off to Taormina for the world diving championships.  That's Taormina, in Sicily! 
INT.  DUFFY'S OFFICE - DAY 
JOHANA dashes in without knocking. 
JOHANA Listen, I just found out we've got real problems in Sicily! 
DUFFY (alarmed) What d'you mean? 
JOHANA (improvising) The mafia!  La Cosa Nostra! Coppola!  De Niro...!  I knew it!  I knew we shouldn't have written that policy!! 
DUFFY (pale) What's happened?? 
JOHANA The documents are forged. 
ENZO (sincerely) I'm glad you're here. 
EXT.  HOTEL TERRACE TAORMINA - JACQUES - ENZO - DAY 
They're at a table on a terrace that overlooks the sea. They've just arrived and all around them people are lunching away furiously. 
ENZO beckons to a passing WAITER who comes to the table. He's a very handsome, slightly effeminate young man. 
ENZO (to waiter) "Spaghetti del mare" (to Jacques) It's delicious here.  It's the one thing they really know how to make. 
WAITER Del mare for two? 
JACQUES (nodding quickly) Yes, sure, for two. 
ENZO And a bottle of "Frascatti".  Two bottles! 
WAITER Si Signore, grazie mille. 
The waiter hurries away.  ENZO watches his departure, then thoughtfully. 
ENZO He moves just like a woman. (then, as if he were speaking to Jacques) It must be hard to live in two worlds like that, huh?  To breathe in one, swim in the other... 
JACQUES nods without really knowing. 
ENZO (suddenly louder) Anyway!  Nothing beats a sexy broad! Huh, Jacques! 
ENZO starts laughing.  JACQUES would like to crawl under the table. 
TIME DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT.  HOTEL TERRACE TAORMINA - JACQUES - ENZO - LATER 
Their lunch is on the table, half eaten. 
ENZO ... So, after all these years, you must have lots of questions to ask. Am I right? 
JACQUES (quickly) Yes, of course.  Lots of questions. 
JACQUES is satisfied with his answer.  He thinks that the subject is closed.  They eat silently for a moment.  ENZO watches him.  Then: 
ENZO Well, what are they? 
JACQUES (giving up) I'm sorry... I don't know how to ask the questions. 
ENZO bursts out laughing. 
ENZO Well, then.  I'll do the asking for you.  "Tell me dear Enzo, how did you become World Champion?"  Oh, that's a long story. (his voice changes) Well, after you left Amorgos, I went back to Italy and joined the Navy. So you now have in front of you -- Captain Molinari, who's been on leave of absence for the past 14 years... 
JACQUES That's good. 
ENZO How do you make a living?  Your experiments, does it pay well? 
JACQUES It's okay. 
ENZO ... You married? 
JACQUES doesn't seem to have ever thought about marriage. 
JACQUES No. 
ENZO Me neither, 'cause of my Mother. She's a curse, my Mamma, a tornado. Stubborn as a mule!  I was engaged... for a week.  After that, Mamma was so mad, I tell you, pasta was bouncing off the walls. 
JACQUES smiles. 
ENZO So, not married.  Well, good for you.  You play the field, like me. A girl in every port, huh? 
JACQUES (bluffing) Exactly, I mean, after all, we're men! 
ENZO (slapping the table top) Damn right!  That's what I tell them when people say you've turned into a fish. 
JACQUES (concerned) People say that? 
ENZO (sorry he went too far) Forget it.  I was joking. 
EXT.  ENTRANCE TO TERRACE - ON JOHANA 
JOHANA comes out of the stone tunnel which leads to the terrace.  She looks over the crowd, trying to find someone. 
JACQUES is sitting with his back to her.  She finally spots him and walks over to the table. 
ENZO Eh!  La Madonna!  This one is for me.  I'll bet you my watch that she's in my bed tonight. 
JACQUES turns around and recognizes her.  JOHANA smiles and walks up to the table.  ENZO takes his watch off and puts it on the table. 
ENZO (quickly) I tell you she's mine! 
JOHANA (to Jacques) Hello! 
ENZO (surprised) You know each other? 
JOHANA Yes. 
Dead silence. 
ENZO is the only one with no plate in front of him. Signora MOLINARI'S eyebrows condense into a dark stripe across her forehead. 
JOHANA hands ENZO'S plate to the WAITER and takes the full one. 
JOHANA (to waiter) Thank you. 
And begins to eat, ignoring the expressions of amazement all around her. 
MAMMA MOLINARI Americana? 
JOHANA nods enthusiastically, her mouth too full to speak. 
MAMMA MOLINARI (impressed, to Johana) Benvenuto! 
MAMMA MOLINARI has a huge grin on her face. 
EXT.  TAORMINA STREET - JACQUES, JOHANA - TWILIGHT 
They emerge onto the street in front of the entrance of a small rooming house. 
JACQUES is carrying JOHANA'S luggage.  The old pension is covered in bright pink bougainvilliers, there is laundry hanging on the other side of the street. 
JOHANA Thanks for helping with the bag. (she looks up at the pension with little enthusiasm) It looks great! 
JACQUES I thought it was a nice place. (suddenly doubting) Isn't it? 
JOHANA I'm being a pain in the ass. (looking at him) It's beautiful here. 
They look at each other.  JACQUES is silent.  He just stands there, a suitcase in each hand. 
JOHANA breaks the silence. 
JOHANA You're going to be very busy these days aren't you? 
JACQUES I don't know... why? 
JOHANA Just because... I would have liked to visit the town... See the coast... I don't know anybody... Expect for you. (feeling she has gone too far) But you are going to be very busy. You must have tons of things to prepare, interviews... And a competition like this one must require a great deal of concentration, right? 
JACQUES (shakes his head negatively) Yes... Maybe... I don't know.  I don't like competitions... It ruins the fun.  Don't you think? 
JOHANA (with a faint smile) I guess... But you know... I'm American and I've mostly been taught to be competitive... There's always pleasure of being the best? 
JACQUES Maybe on earth there is one... but not when you dive... You see, to dive deep into the sea, for no reason... just to do it.  It's a feeling... I don't know how to say this... Voluptuous? 
He looks up at her as he pronounces the last word.  She smiles at him, lovingly. 
JOHANA (laughing) You can put down the suitcases, you know. 
He lets go of the suitcases.  Suddenly, behind them, there is a loud screech of tires.  The FIAT tears across the street. 
ENZO in his FIAT.  He pokes his head out of the window. 
ENZO C'mon, you two... Jacques, we have to get ready for the ceremony tonight.  We have a new world champion. 
JACQUES I'm a little tired, I don't know if... 
ENZO Get in the car! 
INT.  ENZO'S SUITE - ENZO, JACQUES, ROBERTO - NIGHT 
They're in front of a wardrobe looking JACQUES over in the full-length mirrors.  He's wearing an evening shirt and a tuxedo of ENZO'S.  The collar is too big, the sleeves hangover his hands.  He looks at himself dubiously in the mirror. 
ENZO Roberto!  The bow-tie! 
ROBERTO hands ENZO the bow-tie, he hooks it around JACQUES' collar. 
ENZO (taking a few steps back) Very good. 
JACQUES looks down at his tennis shoes. 
ROBERTO What about the shoes? 
ENZO Very chic. (hesitates) Anyway, you don't have anything else, do you? 
JACQUES No. 
ENZO Then, it's very chic.  Avanti! 
EXT.  RECEPTION ON TERRACE - NIGHT 
A big reception is organized on the terrace of the hotel. The official divers and technicians are all gathered in front of a podium.  The terrace is loaded with photographers. 
ROBERTO keeps turning round and round the long buffet table. 
JACQUES is alone at the bar.  Incongruous detail:  a whiskey bottle on the table beside him. 
JOHANA enters.  She has also had a few drinks. 
JOHANA I thought you'd be at the dinner. 
JACQUES nods. 
ENZO Why? 
JACQUES ... For the mermaids. 
ENZO smiles, moved. 
ENZO My father used to see them everywhere too... but the only one he ever caught was my mother... Actually she caught him. 
A beat. 
JACQUES Today at lunch, you asked me if I had any questions. 
ENZO Ah ha.  You finally want to know about women. 
JACQUES Why?  Are they what's most important? 
ENZO No... It depends... Sometimes they are... What, exactly do you want to know? 
JACQUES ... Everything. 
ENZO Everything about what? 
JACQUES (thinking) Well... about everything. 
ENZO grins at JACQUES and starts playing again. 
TIME DISSOLVE TO LATER: 
JACQUES AND ENZO 
There are now several empty champagne bottles around. They are both quite drunk.  ENZO is philosophizing. JOHANA is looking for them. 
ENZO ... So, between Mamma, Roberto and the sisters, we yell and scream all day long.  Except with Angelica. She just cries.  And then finally, we all end up kissing.  Can you explain that to me? 
JACQUES can't answer. 
ENZO Because that's what love is all about.  It's a pain in the ass but keeps us together. (then, in a half dreaming, half desperate tone) A large and beautiful family! 
JOHANA walks over to them. 
JACQUES (suddenly) Enzo... We must quit the competition. 
ENZO hits a wrong note on the piano. 
ENZO (worried) Why? 
JACQUES If we don't... I'm going to beat you. 
JOHANA stands next to JACQUES. 
ENZO (with a nervous laugh) Huh?  Well listen to him! (to Johana) Do you hear that? 
JOHANA No. 
ENZO He looks me in the eye like some fuckin' gold fish, and says:  "I'm going to beat you". 
JOHANA (with a smile) ... That's what he's here for, isn't he? 
ENZO Listen to her!  "That's what he's here for"!  He's here to loose, that's what he's here for.  First of all, I'm unbeatable.  Second, how old are you? 
JACQUES Two years younger than you. 
ENZO As I said, second of all you're too skinny.  You've got tiny lungs.  I still don't understand how you can dive without getting sick. 
JACQUES The size of the lungs has nothing to do with it! 
ENZO Look at me.  These aren't lungs. These are... Tanks.  How long can you hold your breath? 
ENZO is getting really angry.  The drinks have a lot to do with it. 
JACQUES (impatiently) I don't know.  Longer than you. 
ENZO pulls open his collar and rises. 
ENZO We'll see. 
EXT.  HOTEL - SWIMMING POOL - UNDERWATER - NIGHT 
JACQUES and ENZO dive into the pool in their Tuxedos. Each one carries a beach umbrella in a concrete base to help them stay at the bottom. 
ENZO takes two goblets out of his pocket, hands them to JACQUES.  Takes a bottle of Champagne out of the other pocket and opens it.  The cork floats out of the bottle. 
Above on the surface of the pool there's a splash.  JOHANA finds a mask on the side of the pool and watches them. Her dress is soaked by now. 
ENZO pours champagne.  Courteous and grave, they clink glasses and begin to drink.  They have already been underwater longer than a minute.  They can't really drink out of the glasses and ENZO offers JACQUES the bottle. JACQUES studies the label like a connoisseur.  He drinks, passes the bottle back to ENZO. 
INT.  HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT 
Paramedics roll two stretchers toward the elevators at full speed.  ENZO on one, JACQUES on the other.  Both men keep throwing up water. 
ENZO smiles and pats the doctor on the shoulder. 
ENZO Brave. 
EXT.  YACHT - ON DIVING PLATFORM 
It's a large float, rigged to the stern of the Committee Boat.  ROBERTO and an assistant help ENZO down the swim ladder to the platform.  He's wearing a wet suit and fins. He flip-flops to the end of the platform. 
ROBERTO hands him his mask.  The goggles are filled with polystyrene to eliminate as much air pressure as possible. Only two pinholes to see through.  The mask fits tightly over his nose.  When ENZO puts it on, he looks like an astonished insect.  ENZO breathes faster and faster. ROBERTO holds the wire controlling the weighted diving apparatus.  ENZO crosses himself, takes a last long gulp of air. 
ROBERTO releases the weight.  It sinks and drags ENZO down, he quickly disappears into the dark water... 
BLACK AND WHITE 
But this is JACQUES as he was a child.  He swims along the bottom, finds and picks up a gold coin.  We can see its ancient markings, a youth on a dolphin. 
JACQUES looks up.  In front of him is a dolphin, floating vertically, still, apparently just watching.  JACQUES isn't scared anymore.  But every time he swims toward the dolphin, it moves further away.  It finally disappears. 
INT.  HOTEL ROOM - JACQUES - DAY 
He sits bolt upright in bed, awakened by his dream.  He looks around the room, trying to get his bearings. 
JOHANA is asleep in a chair across the room.  On the wall behind her, her last nights dress is drying on a hanger. She's wrapped up in a hotel bathrobe fast asleep. 
JACQUES finally awake from his dream, sees JOHANA sleeping.  He walks over to her, touches her shoulder. She wakes up, starts out of the chair.  She grabs the blanket to cover herself, and in doing so, a book falls on the floor.  It's one of his. 
JOHANA You scared me! 
JACQUES picks up the book.  JOHANA smiles. 
JOHANA Just checking up on your family. (then embarrassed) I guess I was drunker than I thought and the idea of going back to my hotel in a wet dress... Well... 
JACQUES I'm glad you stayed.  Thank you. 
JOHANA (getting up) I'd better get back now. 
JACQUES You... You wouldn't want to spend the day with me? 
She sits back in her chair, amazed that he would even ask. 
JACQUES (self conscious) ... No? 
JOHANA No?  Huh? (she says "No" as if she had asked the question) Yes, of course!! 
EXT.  MARINELAND - TAORMINA - DAY 
JACQUES and JOHANA enter the dolphinarium.  JOHANA is wearing an old pair of JACQUES SHORTS along with an oversized T-shirt and rolled up sweater.  She seems quite pleased with her new attire. 
JACQUES and JOHANA walk straight through MARINELAND and head toward the dolphin pool.  It's pretty crowded, mostly kids. 
The dolphins are lying motionless at the bottom of the pool.  The trainer is tired of throwing fish in the pool and getting absolutely no reaction. 
JACQUES What's the matter? 
TRAINER I don't understand.  We've tried for two days.  They won't eat.  They won't perform.  It's since we got the new one. 
CLOSE ON DOLPHIN 
surfacing.  It thrusts its head over the edge of the pool, looks to JACQUES and SPEAKS. 
JACQUES Is she the new one? 
Surprised, the trainer nods. 
JOHANA looks over at JACQUES then at the dolphin.  She doesn't understand. 
JOHANA How can you tell it's a female? 
JACQUES ... The way she moves. 
Three other dolphins gather around the one that JACQUES is patting. 
JACQUES is staring at the female dolphin.  It looks like the animal is trying to tell him something.  Suddenly the dolphin grabs him by the sleeve and pulls him into the pool. 
UNDERWATER - DOLPHIN POOL 
JACQUES hangs onto the dolphin's muzzle.  Let's it pull him along.  The dolphin swims to a far corner of the pool, and pulls JACQUES to the bottom.  The other dolphins circle above. 
EXT.  DOLPHIN POOL - DAY 
JACQUES pops up.  As he does, three dolphins leap in the air behind him.  JOHANA walks closer to the pool.  She is so excited by what JACQUES is doing, she finally falls into the pool. 
After a while, JACQUES gets out of the pool and helps JOHANA out. 
TRAINER Did you ever think of trying the public pool? 
JOHANA He's a dolphin specialist. 
TRAINER In that case what's wrong with the new one?  Is she sick or not. 
JACQUES (taking his time to answer) Not the way you mean. 
INT.  HOTEL - ENZO'S ROOM - NIGHT 
JACQUES Tell me, why don't you go and get your medal? 
ENZO Because pasta should be eaten "Al Dente".  So the trinket will just have to wait a bit. 
ENZO takes JACQUES by the shoulder.  Inside his room is absolute chaos:  dancing, singing, eating.  Wet suits hung out to dry everywhere.  MAMMA MOLINARI is whipping up mountains of spaghetti on an improvised stove in the middle of the room.  A lot of smoke... steam... color... noise... All of Italy crammed into a few square feet. 
JOHANA taken in by the warm atmosphere, sits in a corner of the room.  JACQUES walks over and sits down at her side. 
ENZO (to Mamma) Mamma!  La pasta?! 
MAMMA MOLINARI Arrivo!  Arrivo! 
She points at ROBERTO who is taking forever to grate the cheese.  ENZO grabs the guitar from his other brother's hands and starts playing. 
ENZO ... It's easy.  You go down.  You come up. (to Johana) ... Right, Johana? 
JOHANA (smiling) Congratulations, Enzo. 
ENZO Don't you agree, Jacques? 
JACQUES ... You always were the best. 
ENZO laughs then sees his mother. 
ENZO Ah!  La pasta! 
ENZO starts singing in Italian.  MAMMA MOLINARI serves the pasta, ROBERTO follows her around, sprinkling his cheese on the plates.  She serves JOHANA a huge plate of pasta, enough for three giants. 
MAMMA MOLINARI (with a smile) Buon appetito, Signorina! 
JOHANA who isn't even hungry, grins uncertainly.  JACQUES has walked up to ENZO.  He doesn't dare ask his question. 
ENZO (smiling) What's the matter?  You still have a bunch of things to ask me?  You want to know the price of tea in China of how we landed on the moon?  Is that it? 
ENZO laughs.  JACQUES is serious. 
JACQUES No, I have to ask you a favor... (a beat) You're the only one who'll understand. 
ENZO (seriously) ... I'm listening. 
INT.  CORRIDOR - NIGHT 
MAMMA MOLINARI Tutto va bene? 
The three officials are eating pasta, plates on their knees.  Their mouths are too full to speak, they nod enthusiastically. 
NOVELLI (mouth full) Gracie mille, chignora. 
MAMMA MOLINARI smiles and slams the door. 
INT.  FIAT - NIGHT 
JACQUES is driving, JOHANA sits beside him.  ENZO crammed in the back seat, very uncomfortably, because of a stretcher which takes up all the space. 
They are dressed as they were at ENZO'S party. 
ENZO (leaning forward) Hey!  Will you slow down!  When did you learn how to drive? 
JACQUES Driving isn't the problem, it's remembering the right road. 
JACQUES runs a red light. 
ENZO And the lights!  Running lights, stealing stretchers...!  You'll have us in jail. 
JOHANA Enzo, stop bitching, will you? 
EXT.  MARINELAND PARKING LOT - FIAT - NIGHT 
They get out of the car.  JACQUES starts to change into his swimming trunks.  ENZO shakes his head, can't believe he's really come along.  He laughs and starts undressing. 
INT./ EXT.  FIAT - STREET TAORMINA - NIGHT 
It's a very narrow street.  The car moves down it quickly. JACQUES drives.  The back seat is now occupied by the dolphin.  Its nose and tail protruding through the windows. 
JOHANA is in the front seat, turned around, spraying the dolphin with a watering can. 
EXT.  BEACH - NIGHT 
They have driven to the public beach.  They slowly lower the stretcher into the water.  The dolphin, leaving the stretcher, swims around a little but won't go away. 
He won't leave JACQUES. 
JACQUES (moved) You can't stay here!  Come on!  Go away! 
JACQUES swims off with her for a while. 
ENZO walks back toward the car with the stretcher. 
JOHANA, standing by the water looks at JACQUES and the dolphin who are swimming off together. 
NOVELLI (smiling) Yes... It's magic. 
INT.  BOAT - DAY - LATER 
On the boat, NOVELLI checks his watch.  JACQUES comes out of his room.  He's dressed to dive.  He ignores everyone as he goes down the ladder to the diving platform.  He seems to be in another world.  All sounds coming to him are drowned out. 
EXT.  DIVING PLATFORM - DAY 
JACQUES sits in the diver's slot.  Opens his eyes slowly and looks around.  He puts his flippers on, an assistant stands at his side. 
HIS POV 
The figures on the platform are vague, the VOICES are GARBLED and incomprehensible.  Moving almost in slow motion he raises three fingers. 
TECHNICIAN Tre minuti! 
BACK TO SCENE 
Ten other divers have waited for this signal to dive. They disappear one by one into the blue. 
JACQUES uses contact lenses instead of a mask.  He puts them in, and now, his view of the world is as distorted as his hearing... bodies deform... sounds fade... 
Already euphoric from the vast amount of oxygen in his system, he moves into another reality altogether... seems to empty himself out. 
TECHNICIAN Due minuti! 
JACQUES fills a small tube with water.  Pours it into his nostrils... tilts his head... then lets it run out... He puts on his gloves... all his movements are slow, he seems to be operating in a different time zone... He seems unable to take his eyes off the water. 
EXT.  END OF DIVING PLATFORM - DAY 
TECHNICIAN Uno minuto! 
JACQUES puts his nose clip on.  He puts his hand on the gueuse.  Closes his eyes and inhales slowly.  Then he takes a sudden last breath, nods, the technician releases the gueuse and in one flashing movement, he disappears. 
UNDERWATER 
The gueuse slides down the cable.  JACQUES hangs on like a ribbon in the wind, past a marker, 90 feet down. 
Above him, the boat disappears from sight. 
He moves faster and faster... through a sea that looks like a cloudy sky.  The light fades rapidly around him. 
Below, white spotlights pierce an ocean dark as night. JACQUES reaches them in a matter of seconds.  Turns the brakes, brings his machine to a halt, 180 feet down. 
The medics are waiting for him there.  They take his pulse.  Check his eyes... 15 seconds... normal... the bubbles from there scuba tanks churn the water around them... 
JACQUES closes his eyes... a tap on the shoulder, he releases the brake on the gueuse.  Plunges further, this time into pitch black. 
Below him a faint spotlight glows on the bottom.  He reaches it and the dark diver moves to him.  JACQUES brakes his machine.  Moving very slowly, turns his body right side up.  Like a sleep walker, JACQUES starts to take the plaque off the plumbline... pauses in the middle of the gesture. 
The dark diver flashes the high sign to JACQUES, thumb and forefinger touching, fingers extended, all clear.  JACQUES does not respond.  The diver repeats the signal.  JACQUES does not respond. 
The diver taps JACQUES on the shoulder... a beat... and then JACQUES responds, thumb and forefinger touching okay. Slowly, reluctantly, he wraps his hand around the handle of the balloon. 
The dark diver quickly turns the handle for him.  The balloon inflates.  JACQUES hangs on... lets it carry him up. 
At the plague marking 210 feet, JACQUES lets go of the the balloon.  With a burst of speed, it darts toward the surface. 
JACQUES follows slowly, undulating like a fish... He's getting warm now... He closes his eyes. 
Passes the medical control without stopping... without even seeing it like someone asleep. 
He's moving faster now, toward the warmth, toward the air. JACQUES opens his eyes, watches the lights grow brighter. 
The silhouette of the boat comes back into view.  60 feet to go. 
EXT.  DIVING PLATFORM - DAY 
In slow motion JACQUES' hand holding the plaque breaks out of the water followed by his arm, in one continuous movement, his shoulders and head. 
He gasps for air. 
A trickle of blood comes from his nose. 
Flashbulbs flicker, spectators cheer. 
EXT.  OPEN SEA - A DOLPHIN 
The dolphin, the one rescued last night, leaps into the air, in perfect harmony with JACQUES' triumph. 
EXT.  DOLPHINARIUM 
The dolphins in the dolphinarium leap into the air at the exact same moment. 
The trainer doesn't understand what's going on. 
EXT.  DIVING PLATFORM - DAY 
JACQUES falls back into the water.  Two divers run over and pull him up onto the dock. 
JACQUES seems completely dazed, almost in a trance.  He slowly comes to and starts screaming louder and louder. It is the scream of his body in need of the surface, reality and the feel of the land. 
LATER 
JACQUES is in bed with JOHANA.  They are both asleep. Suddenly, he sits up, as he always does after his recurrent dream. 
He's wide awake, looks over at her sleeping.  She sleeps peacefully like a baby.  Quietly, gently, he eases out of bed and walks to the open window. 
He stands on the balcony, staring at the sea.  Then in the distance in the moonlight, a dolphin leaps out of the water, once, twice, a third time. 
JACQUES laughs and goes back to the bed where he sits down next to JOHANA.  She is still sound asleep. 
EXT.  HOTEL - PIER - NIGHT 
JACQUES quickly gets into one of his diving suits.  He puts on his flippers.  The dolphin is still jumping in and out of the water.  JACQUES jumps off the pier and swims over to her. 
INT.  JACQUES' HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 
JOHANA rolls over and feels the bed in her sleep. 
JACQUES' absence wakes her. 
JOHANA Jacques? 
She gets up and walks over to the balcony.  She doesn't see anything. 
EXT.  PIER - NIGHT 
JOHANA walks down the pier and notices the little pile of clothes JACQUES has left behind.  She looks around but still can't see anything.  She decides to sit next to the pile of clothes, and waits, her eyes riveted to the sea. 
EXT.  PIER - DAWN 
The sky has just begun to light up again.  JOHANA is still sitting next to the pile of clothes. 
She is wearing JACQUES' sweater.  She looks sad, yet serene.  The look of a woman who has been thinking over the situation and who has made up her mind. 
Tired, JACQUES swims back to the pier.  It looks as if he has come out of nowhere. 
He is exhausted.  He takes off his flippers and gets up onto the pier in front of JOHANA.  He looks at her, a little surprised to find her there. 
JACQUES (warm) What are you doing here? 
She answers in a far away voice, with the same serene sadness. 
JOHANA I'm going to leave, Jacques. 
Dripping with water, he sits down next to her.  His face is drawn from fatigue.  She continues. 
JOHANA I'm going back home. 
JACQUES Why? 
JOHANA Because one shouldn't fall in love with creatures from the sea. 
JACQUES I'm not from the sea... I don't understand what you're talking about. 
JOHANA Yes you do.  You know exactly what I'm talking about.  You're afraid I want to hold onto you, and I do, but you're not ready... at least not for me. 
JACQUES But it's not true, I feel good with you... It feels right... 
She looks at him for a moment, then takes his face in her hands and rests it on her bosom, as if a small child. 
JOHANA I've got to get back to the hotel... and get my suitcase packed. 
INT.  TRAIN STATION - JACQUES - JOHANA - DAY 
The train station faces the sea.  JACQUES and JOHANA are standing on the platform, amid others.  In the distance we hear the rumble and whistle of a train. 
JOHANA gets on the train.  The station master blows his whistle. 
JACQUES Will... will we see each other again? 
JOHANA'S eyes are filled with tears. 
JOHANA Take good care of yourself, Jacques. 
The train starts pulling out of the station. 
JACQUES Where can I call you?  Johana, tell me where can I call you? 
JOHANA doesn't answer.  JACQUES stands helplessly in the station, his eyes filled with tears. 
INT.  ENZO'S ROOM - DAY 
ENZO opens the door of his suite.  His hair is messed up, he's got "sheet prints" on his face and is wearing the top of a diving suit. 
JACQUES Can I come in? 
ENZO No problem, I enjoy talking in my sleep. 
ENZO walks back into the apartment and crashes on the bed. He's lying on his stomach.  JACQUES walks in and lets himself drop in a chair. 
ENZO Wake me up at 11:00. 
The SUPERINTENDENT watches over the technician's shoulder. 
TECHNICIAN They're at 450 feet. 
INT.  DIVING CAPSULE - DAY 
ENZO, a cigarette dangling from his lips, looks through the porthole. 
ENZO ... I was seventeen, I loved her so much I tried to die for her.  Two years later I couldn't even remember her name!  Let me tell you, time erases everything! 
JACQUES I don't want to erase anything. 
ENZO You'd rather think about it and make yourself miserable? 
JACQUES (after thinking about it) ... Yes. 
ENZO (smiles) I give you this.  You're stubborn... Dumb, but stubborn. 
JACQUES (taking it as a compliment) Thank you. 
INT.  CAPSULE - DAY 
The technician fiddles with a few knobs. 
TECHNICIAN Minus 800 feet.  End of descent. 
INT.  DIVING CAPSULE 
The diving capsule ends its descent.  The COMMANDER turns to ENZO and JACQUES who is still staring out the porthole. 
NOIREUTER (with a Mickey Mouse voice) You have enough air for 15 minutes. 
ENZO bursts out laughing. 
ENZO (with Donald Ducks voice) What's with the voice? 
NOIREUTER It's nothing.  It's just the helium, because of the air pressure. 
ENZO (worried) And... does the voice come back? 
NOIREUTER For others, yes... For you, who knows? 
ENZO (still a little worried, to Jacques) Try speaking to me? 
JACQUES (with Daffy Ducks voice) I don't find this funny.  We were having a serious conversation. 
ENZO and JACQUES burst out laughing.  They keep these same voice till the end of the scene. 
ENZO pulls out a tiny silver flask out of his pocket. 
ENZO (to Jacques) Here, give me your finger. 
ENZO taps a drop onto JACQUES' finger, then on his own. Then NOIREUTER blows up. 
NOIREUTER (in a panic) Is that alcohol?  Are you out of your mind?  Alcohol is strictly forbidden. 
ENZO (loosing his temper) Hey!  D'you have any other complaints?  Just make a list and we'll stick it on the porthole! Okay? 
ENZO pours a second drop on his own finger. 
ENZO Go on, suck your finger. 
JACQUES hesitates.  ENZO has no qualms about it and sucks his own finger.  NOIREUTER is petrified. 
NOIREUTER Are you crazy?  At this pressure? 
JACQUES It's very deep down here. 
ENZO Come on, suck your finger, you'll be seeing mermaids everywhere! 
JACQUES, convinced sucks his finger too.  ENZO smiles. The alcohol has an immediate effect on them. 
ENZO (to Jacques) A thousand commanders and we get a Belgian from Alcoholic's Anonymous. 
UNDERWATER 
ENZO gets out of the diving capsule, head first. He is connected to the capsule by a number of cables. 
JACQUES, who follows him, gets completely tangled up in them.  They are both hilariously drunk. 
INT.  DRILLING PLATFORM - CONTROL ROOM 
The SUPERINTENDENT hears them laughing through the control room speakers.  He flips a communication switch. 
SUPERINTENDENT Can you hear me?  What's going on? (to the technician) Are you sure you're on the right channel? 
The technician nods back to him. 
UNDERWATER 
The two divers have gotten to the spot they are supposed to be working on.  They have their arms around each other and are dancing. 
JOHANA'S face lights up with a huge smile. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
LATER 
JOHANA is still on the phone, sitting in front of the bay window.  Day is dawning. 
JOHANA (looking out at the skyline) It's getting light out. 
JACQUES (V.O.) Here, it's getting dark. 
JOHANA smiles.  She stretches, lies down on the carpeted floor.  JACQUES seems to have gone through all topics of conversation. 
JACQUES I've been thinking about you a lot, you know... 
JOHANA is by now completely stretched out on the floor. 
JOHANA So have I. (a beat) ... Hello? 
JACQUES I'm still here. 
JOHANA Well, then, talk to me some more. 
JACQUES ... It's hard you know.  You're so far away and I don't know what else to say. 
JOHANA Then, tell me a story. 
JACQUES Uh... Ah!  A story? 
He turns around and sits on the window sill, his feet dangling in mid air. 
He looks at the sea, seeking inspiration. 
JACQUES Do you know how it is? (starting again) Do you know what you're supposed to do to meet a mermaid? 
JOHANA (with a smile) No... tell me. 
JACQUES You go down to the bottom of the sea, where the water isn't even blue anymore, where the sky is only a memory... and you float there, quietly, quietly and stay there... and you decide that you will die for them... Only then do they start coming out.  They come and greet you and they judge the love you have for them... If it's sincere.  If it's pure... They will be with you and take you away forever. 
JOHANA listens with the abandon of a child being put to sleep. 
INT.  JACQUES' ROOM - ANTIBES 
The sun hits the roof tops.  The sea is sparkling. The phone rings on the window sill.  JACQUES answers. 
JACQUES Hello? 
JOHANA (V.O.) It's me again. 
JACQUES smiles. 
JOHANA (after a silence) I'm being a pain, huh? 
JACQUES ... Not at all. 
JOHANA (V.O.) You sure? 
JACQUES (smiling) Absolutely positive. 
JOHANA (V.O.) Okay.  In that case... I'm at the airport in Nice. 
JACQUES doesn't know what to say.  He looks around him, can't figure out what to do. 
JACQUES (lost) Okay... huh, I'll be right over. 
INT.  AIRPORT - DAY 
JOHANA is standing in front of the airport. 
JACQUES sees her.  They smile shyly at each other. 
EXT.  STREET - NICE - OPPOSITE THE NEGRESCO HOTEL 
JACQUES and JOHANA are sitting in the back of a taxi.  The driver stops in front of the hotel. 
DRIVER (loud) The Carlton!  Enjoy your siesta. 
JACQUES and JOHANA look at each other. 
INT.  HOTEL ROOM - JACQUES - JOHANA - DAY 
The room is in semi-darkness, despite the blazing sunlight coming through cracks in the shutters.  JACQUES and JOHANA are making love.  JACQUES is on top of her, his whole body covered in sweat.  The rumpled sheets and the movements of their bodies suggest the movements of the sea.  ALL SOUNDS are disproportionate and slightly distorted, they are underwater... 
ALL JOHANA'S reluctance has vanished.  Both of them act like people who have never felt anything like this before. A certain astonishment at the depth of their feeling.  An increasing freedom.  All the muscles of their bodies stretch to their limits. 
JACQUES, progressively, finds himself disappearing.  His image dissolves point by point... disintegrates into unbroken blue... The effect creates the impression of someone melting, the screen is now totally blue. 
A thin, HIGH-PITCHED SOUND. 
From the bottom of the image, a tiny pinpoint starts TOWARD the CAMERA.  It is JACQUES, naked, swimming out of the deep blue ocean toward the light as if he were coming out of a dive.  He comes CLOSER and CLOSER to the CAMERA... 
JACQUES (with a sigh) It's my apartment. 
UNCLE LOUIS (jumping up) Liar!  Thief!  Torturer!  When you were an orphan I nursed you at my breast. 
JACQUES Uncle Louis, we have a guest! 
UNCLE LOUIS I'm going to put a lock on the telephone. (them calming down, to Johana) Did you bring the cassettes? 
INT.  BEDROOM - JACQUES - JOHANA 
JACQUES' room looks like a diving equipment storage room with a bed in it.  JACQUES notices JOHANA'S gaze. 
JACQUES (solicitously) You think it'll be all right? You'll be comfortable here? 
JOHANA (catching her breath) It's going to be... interesting. 
EXT.  PORT OF ANTIBES - DAY 
JACQUES, JOHANA and ROBERTO are waiting at the port. 
ROBERTO (glancing at his watch) ... It's not like him to be late. Of course sometimes he doesn't show up at all.  Once in Capri, he... 
JOHANA (interrupting) We get the picture, Roberto. (looks over her shoulder) Jacques, I think Louis needs help. 
JACQUES turns around.  UNCLE LOUIS is a few yards behind them at a fish stand on the dock.  He's holding up an eel and screaming at the fishmonger. 
UNCLE LOUIS (yelling) Two dollars for this!  This fish wasn't caught.  It died of cancer! 
JACQUES shrugs his shoulders and gives up on the idea of interfering. 
ROBERTO (pointing) Here he comes! 
A speed boat races along the water.  It's a beautiful highly-varnished mahogany Riva.  It races into the port. Standing at the helm, looking like Christopher Columbus his hair brushed back by the wind, is ENZO. 
Next to him hanging on to the windscreen is an impressive six foot, dark haired beauty.  She has a scarf over her hair.  She wears a purple leather micro-mini with a cerise halter top and her ruby fingernails are three inches long. If she ever actually would get cast in a movie, she'd make Raquel Welch hide in shame.  Her stage name is BONITA MARIPOSA. 
ENZO kills the THROTTLE, swings the speedboat into a perfect landing at the dock.  ROBERTO takes the lines. 
ENZO Jacques!  Johana! 
JOHANA Enzo! 
JACQUES Enzo! 
During all of this, everyone's attention is actually on BONITA who is tugging at her long black hair.  They're all awestruck except for ROBERTO. 
ROBERTO (meaning the speed boat) Where did you get that? 
ENZO (meaning Bonita) "That"!  This is not a "that"... This is Bonita Mariposa, the famous Spanish actress. (whispering to Bonita) ... Who is going to be careful with the varnish... (back to Roberto) And who has come to spend a few days with us. (and very quickly) Where's Mamma? 
ROBERTO (checking watch) You have eight hours before she gets here. 
ENZO glances at his watch and sighs with relief.  BONITA says hello to JACQUES, kisses JOHANA. 
INT.  LIVING ROOM IN JACQUES' APARTMENT - DAY 
Loud classical music booms from the stereo.  The noise pins JACQUES, ENZO and ROBERTO to their chairs. 
UNCLE LOUIS gets a bottle of whiskey and serves everybody. 
ENZO He's really going totally deaf! 
UNCLE LOUIS I'm not as deaf as you are blind, my boy!  You take care of your eyes, I'll take care of my ears! 
ENZO (laughing) I'm sorry Uncle Louis. 
UNCLE LOUIS pours him a whiskey. 
UNCLE LOUIS Come on, drink up, my boy!  It might just save us from your bullshit. 
The bottle is empty.  UNCLE LOUIS goes to the kitchen. JACQUES turns down the music, and finally hears the bell which has been ringing.  JACQUES opens the apartment door: it's Professor LAWRENCE.  Suit and tie and carrying a bottle. 
JACQUES I'm glad you could come.  I want you to meet Enzo. 
ENZO and LAWRENCE shake hands. 
LAWRENCE (with a smile) So you're the famous Enzo Molinari? 
ENZO (with an even bigger smile) In the flesh.  I have that honor! 
INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT 
JOHANA comes into the bathroom, closes the door, cutting down the blaring music.  The paint is peeling off the ceiling. 
BONITA is standing under a 40 watt lamp, putting on make- up in front of JACQUES' cracked shaving mirror. 
BONITA You're going to live here permanently? 
JOHANA ... Maybe, if Jacques will let me fix up the place a little. 
JOHANA walks over to the mirror and watches BONITA put on her make-up like a professional. 
EXT.  DIVING PLATFORM - ENZO 
Surfacing.  Assistants help him onto the platform. ROBERTO pulls off his fins.  ENZO rips off his mask.  He looks furious.  He tosses the depth plaque (which proves he is qualified) back into the water. 
ENZO A shit dive. 
He looks around angrily for an official.  Sees NOVELLI. 
ENZO Those goddamned frogmen doctors waiting around at 200 feet they just kill your concentration. 
NOVELLI They're required by law. 
ENZO (climbing off platform) There's no law down there!  The only law is what your lungs can take. (to the next diver) ... Have fun!  They waiting for you down there, to take the temperature of your ass. 
He keeps on walking across the boat, runs into JACQUES, who's just about to begin his yoga preparation. 
JACQUES sees ENZO'S expression, looks concerned. 
ENZO (defensively) Anybody can have a bad day! 
JACQUES I've had many... when the sea doesn't want you. 
ENZO (disgusted) It's never the sea!  It's Roberto, Mamma, that stupid actress... Oh shit!  Jacques, what do you know? Go do your Hindu exercises and don't break my balls! 
ENZO stamps into one of the cabins. 
INT.  JACQUES' APARTMENT - NIGHT 
JOHANA is reading a child birth catalog.  She throws it away upside down, as soon as she hears JACQUES approaching.  JACQUES comes in and sits opposite her.  He seems bitter. 
JOHANA Well, how was it? 
In an involuntary gesture, JACQUES flips through the catalog. 
JACQUES (sadly) Enzo had a bad day. 
JOHANA wonders if JACQUES will understand the presence of the baby magazine. 
JOHANA (tense) And you? 
JACQUES I didn't dive. 
JOHANA (she takes the magazine) You'll try again tomorrow? 
JACQUES I don't know... it didn't feel right.  I'm going to bed.  I'm tired. 
He goes away. 
JOHANA You forgot your magazine! 
He hasn't heard. 
JACQUES goes to the bedroom, and throws himself on the bed. 
JOHANA looks as if she had wished he'd put two and two together. 
JACQUES What? 
JOHANA ... Nothing.

EXT.  COMMITTEE BOAT AT SEA - DAY 
ENZO bursts out of the water.  He rips off his face mask, throws it on the diving platform, roaring with pleasure. He tosses the depth plague to ROBERTO. 
ENZO Let them try. 
INT.  JACQUES' APARTMENT - DAY 
JOHANA opens the apartment door.  BONITA is standing there, a suitcase in one hand. 
BONITA I wanted to say goodbye, Johana. 
They kiss each other goodbye. 
JOHANA is very uncomfortable. 
JOHANA You're leaving? 
BONITA Yes... (she hands her a note) Could you please give this to Enzo. 
JOHANA Of course. 
BONITA grabs the note back and tears it up. 
BONITA It's no use... Just tell him I said goodbye... And give him a kiss for me, Okay? 
The two women hug again. 
JOHANA (sorry) Bonita, you shouldn't be discouraged so easily. 
The diver realizes and starts after him.  He grabs JACQUES by one of his fins and pulls him back to the round platform.  JACQUES lets go of the balloon. 
The diver panics.  JACQUES slowly motions that everything is fine and slowly paddles up to the surface. 
EXT.  COMMITTEE BOAT - DAY 
The boat's huge stop watch indicates min:  4:50, then 5:00, then 5:10.  JACQUES has been down there for over 5 minutes. 
JOHANA is worried sick.  ENZO doesn't know what to make of it and LAWRENCE feels completely helpless.  The stopwatch indicates 5:20, then 5:25 and JACQUES, half unconscious, brakes through the surface of the water. 
JOHANA screams and cries with joy when she sees him.  The crowd applauds.  ENZO is somber. 
NOVELLI takes the plaque from JACQUES' hands and turns to the crowd. 
NOVELLI (stunned) 360 feet!  He dove 360 feet!!! 
The crowd cheers in excitement. 
ENZO is sullen.  LAWRENCE is very worried. 
EXT.  ON PORT - END OF THE DAY 
There's a pile of gear on the dock. 
ENZO is in the boat loading one piece of luggage at a time, JACQUES comes up to the boat.  Parked in the background, we see a taxi waiting with JOHANA sitting in the back seat.  ENZO pretends not to notice JACQUES' arrival. 
JACQUES watches him for a moment then finally dares to speak. 
JACQUES (pointing at taxi) ... There's a party at the hotel tonight. 
ENZO keeps loading up the boat. 
ENZO (busy) That's good. 
JACQUES (after a beat) Enzo, don't be angry.  I was lucky... that's all. 
ENZO throws the last duffel bag into the cockpit. 
ENZO (serious) I'll see you in Amorgos. 
ENZO turns around and jumps onto his boat. 
JACQUES walks off the dock, past the cab.  JOHANA opens the door to let him in, but he keeps walking. 
JOHANA Jacques...? 
JACQUES You go back, I'll walk. 
He walks off. 
EXT.  MARINELAND - DOLPHIN POOL - ANTIBES - NIGHT 
The park is empty as JACQUES approaches the pool. 
TINA the dolphin, jumps out of the water, swims to meet JACQUES.  JACQUES pats her and kneels to talk to TINA NINA. 
JACQUES (sadly) I won today.  I dove very deep, Tina. 
The dolphin giggles. 
JACQUES What's so funny?  Can you dive deeper? 
The dolphin nods "yes". 
JACQUES smiles. 
JACQUES (smiling) So you understand everything? 
The dolphin nods. 
JACQUES That's good... So tell me why they're all angry at me?  Why is Enzo angry?  I never wanted to compete with him.  I never wanted to be champion of anything... All I want is to escape from them all... For just a few minutes, no people... No noise... Nothing but the sea. 
The dolphin nods and giggles. 
JACQUES Do you really understand me?  Huh? Are we actually having a conversation here? 
Again the dolphin nods "yes". 
JACQUES All right then, tell me:  can I ever dive as deep as you?  Stay under as long...? 
A beat.  Then the dolphin nods "yes". 
JACQUES Are you sure? 
The two other dolphins stick their heads out of the water. They all nod together. 
JACQUES is awed and perplexed at the same time. 
EXT.  AMORGOS - DAY 
The little town of Amorgos is beautiful, mountainous. It's surrounded by a luminous turquoise sea, with white villas clinging to hillsides.  There is a small port.  (we saw it in the opening sequence) Further along the coast, we see the Diving Federation Committee Boat surrounded by all sorts of activity.

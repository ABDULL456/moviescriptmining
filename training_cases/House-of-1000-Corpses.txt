FADE IN: 
INT. OLD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
We see a LITTLE GIRL dancing around in a grainy super 8 home movie. A LITTLE BOY wearing a monster MASK enters the frame. He struggles to lift a double barrel shotgun. He points it at the girl and pretends to SHOOT. 
GIRL (V.O.) (whispering slowly) Once I had a cat, he was the sweetest little guy. Then one day he got sick and died. My heart was broken. My whole body hurt. 
She continues dancing. The little boy imitates her. 
GIRL (V.O.) After that, I saw things differently, everything could be summed up with three simple words... fuck the world. 
The camera swings over to some ugly, toothless relations watching the show. They laugh. 
EXT. SPAULDING'S - NIGHT 
We open on a dark, lonely stretch of two lane blacktop. 
Off to the side of the road we see a rundown gas station. 
RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Hey, welcome back to 93.5 WJRC's Halloween monster weekend. I'm Jimmy Ray and I'll be bringing you the oldies, the goldies and sometimes the moldies. The good, the bad and the uglies straight from the WJRC vaults. 
A weathered wooden sign proclaims CAPTAIN SPAULDING'S WORLD OF MONSTERS AND MADMEN, sits atop the building. 
A smaller sign below reads FRIED CHICKEN AND GASOLINE. 
RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Hey, kids still trying to decide on the right costume? Well why not head on down to Randall's Penny Save located on Kimball Rd. just off route 1 in Mackin County. Choose from a wide array of ghosts and ghouls, jeepers and creepers... (scary sound effects) ...everything you need for your Halloween needs. 
SHERIFF HUSTON, a tall southern good old boy, leans against his dusty cruiser smoking a cigarette, pumping gas into his tank. 
INT. CAPT. SPAULDING'S - NIGHT 
Inside is a poorman's Ripley's Believe It or Not. 
Bizarre props and treasures of killers and monsters cover the dirty walls. Wax figures of JACK THE RIPPER stand guard before oil paintings by JOHN WAYNE GACY. 
RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Alright let's get back to our monster music marathon with this classic called The Teddy Bear's Picnic. 
Perched on a stool behind the counter sits CAPTAIN SPAULDING, a crusty looking old man in a filthy clown suit and smeared make-up. The word LOVE is tattooed across his right knuckles and HATE is tattooed across the left. 
He is reading the newspaper, crunching on crackers from a paper bag and halfheartedly listening to a small, nerdy man wearing coke bottle glasses named STUCKY. 
Stucky thumbs through a stack of autographed 8x10 photographs. 
STUCKY (speaking through voicebox in his throat) I... I got back a stack today. Some nice shots. (holds up a picture of June Wilkinson) See, a good topless June Wilkinson... unfortunately she personalized it... (looking at the photo) to Stucky, love June. 
CAPT. SPAULDING Hmmmmm. 
STUCKY Shit, this ain't worth nothing now that my name gotten all over it. I was a fixin' on trading it to Jackie Cobb. 
CAPT. SPAULDING The retard over at Molly's fruit stand. 
STUCKY Yeah, he's all hot on her after he found some of his dad's old nudie books hidden in the basement. He keeps 'em taped inside his school workbook. 
Spaulding brushes cracker crumbs off his paper and continues reading. 
CAPT. SPAULDING Fascinating. 
STUCKY That kid is one horny retard. 
CAPT. SPAULDING Christ, ain't they all. All them retards wanna do is fuck and eat. 
STUCKY Well, yeah... I think that if you knew him... I mean if you'd understand his urges, shit the guy's like forty or something. 
CAPT. SPAULDING Worse than a fucking rabid baboon. 
STUCKY Yeah, I guess, you know next to wacking his weasel his other favorite thing is twisting sharpened pencils in the corner of his eyes. 
CAPT. SPAULDING What? 
INT. SPAULDING'S - BACKROOM - NIGHT 
A silent RED LIGHT FLASHES. In the dim glow, we see RAVELLI, a large hunched figure, sitting on the edge of a bed. The figure is heavily bandaged. 
Ravelli reacts to the flashing light, he RISES and puts a huge mask over his head. He EXITS the room. 
INT. BATHROOM STALL - NIGHT 
Stucky sits on the toilet pasting stamps on large yellow envelopes. 
Killer Rich KICKS OPEN the stall, GRABS Stucky by the neck and PULLS him out. 
RICH Come on, fatboy! 
EXT. CAPT. SPAULDING'S - NIGHT 
We move around the outside of the building watching the scene inside unfold. HEAVY BREATHING is heard. 
Rich DRAGS Stucky into the main room. 
INT. SPAULDING'S - NIGHT 
Karl grows increasingly HOSTILE, knocks a candy display over, raises his gun over his head and fires into the ceiling. 
KARL (screaming) That's it. I'm gonna count to ten and you're gonna hand over the cash or I'm gonna splatter your grease paint mug across the stateline... one. 
CAPT. SPAULDING Fuck your mother. 
KARL Two. 
CAPT. SPAULDING Fuck your sister. 
RICH Come on, man. Just shoot him. 
STUCKY (recognizing Rich's voice) Hey, I know you. We were in high school together. Wood shop, right? ...Richard Wick... right? 
He looks nervously at Stucky. 
RICH Shut up, shut up, shut up! 
KARL Quiet down... three. 
CAPT. SPAULDING Fuck your grandmother. 
STUCKY Yeah, I remember Mr. Alacard the shop teacher use'ta call you Little Dick Wick. Hey, wasn't there a song we made up to go with that? 
RICH (temper rising) Shut up! 
STUCKY (singing) Little Dick Wick, play with his prick Don't his smell, just make you sick. 
EXT. CAPT. SPAULDING'S - NIGHT 
From Ravelli's POV we watch through the window, as everybody inside starts SHOUTING at each other. 
Suddenly, Rich SHOOTS Stucky. Stucky FALLS BACKWARDS against the wall, screaming in pain. 
We move QUICKLY towards the entrance. 
INT. CAPT. SPAULDING'S - NIGHT 
Suddenly... CRASH! Ravelli SMASHES through the front door knocking Karl to the ground. In the light we see that Ravelli is wearing an OVERSIZED CLOWN HEAD. In his hand is a sledgehammer. 
Rich TURNS toward the COMMOTION. The Captain quickly WHIPS OUT a GUN and FIRES. Rich falls dead. 
Ravelli lunges at Karl, smashing him over the head with the hammer. Ravelli's clown head comes loose and falls to the floor. We now see that Ravelli is a bald pitbull of a man with badly scarred skin that is painted white and red. 
Karl hits the floor and begins CONVULSING violently. 
Spaulding STEPS DOWN from behind the counter, puts his foot on Karl's throat and points his pistol at Karl's head. 
CAPT. SPAULDING And most of all... fuck you! 
BOOM! Spaulding SHOOTS Karl in the head. 
The screen EXPLODES RED, then TURNS BLACK. 
CAPT. SPAULDING (V.O.) God damn it, that motherfucker got blood all over my best clown suit. 
BILL Perfect. 
JERRY I hope this place is cool. We could use something interesting to liven up chapter 12. 
The car drives past. We turn and hold on the billboard. We see the happy smiling face of a young Captain Spaulding. 
EXT. CAPTAIN SPAULDING'S - NIGHT 
The car pulls up to one of the gas pumps. Bill and Jerry get out. Inside we see Spaulding, now in army pants and a hunting jacket, mopping the floor. 
BILL I'll pump the gas. Go inside and see if it's worth thinking about. 
JERRY (salutes) OK, Boss. 
Jerry walks inside and immediately comes back out. 
JERRY Holy crap. You gotta see this place. It's awesome. 
BILL How awesome? 
JERRY Really fucking awesome. 
BILL Wake up the chicks and bust out the camera awesome? 
JERRY Hell yeah. 
Jerry sticks his head back inside the car. 
JERRY Wakey, wakey, eggs and bakey. 
INT. CAR - BACK SEAT - NIGHT 
A dark haired girl, DENISE WILLIS, 27, sleeps curled up under a blanket. 
JERRY Come on, babe. Me and Bill found a kick ass place. 
She opens her eyes. 
DENISE Huh? 
JERRY Grab Mary and come inside. 
Denise shakes a lump of jackets and sweaters lying next to her. She removes a sweater from the top of the pile to REVEAL the face of MARY KNOWLES, 29. 
DENISE Come on sleeping beauty, time to go to work. 
MARY (half asleep) Sleeping. 
DENISE Rise and shine. 
MARY (groggy) No please, let me sit this one out. 
DENISE (removing the blanket) Let's go. You're the one who wanted to be a photographer. 
MARY I resign. 
DENISE Too late. You're in for life, let's move it out Private Shutterbug. 
MARY (opening her eyes) Christ, I hope this isn't more crappy folk art. It's so quaint... it's so primal... it's so crap. 
DENISE Aw, it ain't crap... it's... cute. (sarcastic) ...and really who are we to judge the artistic merit of the tin-can Mona Lisa? 
MARY Aw, shit... (exhales deeply) I gotta pee anyway. 
INTERLUDE 
Grainy super 8 footage shows us an OLD MAN standing in front of a small shack. His name is Lewis Dover. The shack is painted white and covered with SIMPLISTIC RELIGIOUS WRITINGS. 
LEWIS I ain't no rich man, but I see the truth. You do not have to go to Hell. You are in Hell. This is Hell. All American Hell. (holds up a gun) ...true heaven in my hands... I'm gonna blow Satan back through the door to Hell. 
Surrounding the shack are strange sculptures of various half- human/half-animal creations. 
INT. SPAULDING'S - NIGHT 
Spaulding swabs up the last remains of blood from the floor, he drops the mop into a bucket filled with water and blood. 
Bill pays no attention, he is distracted by a strange object in a glass case over the counter. In the case is a shriveled up looking half human and half fish figure. It is the size of a small child. A banner above reads: 
MARY If I never eat at another Waffle House again, I can die a happy girl. 
DENISE Scattered, smothered and covered. 
MARY Exactly... well, I guess a couple more photos won't kill me. 
INT. SPAULDING'S - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT 
Jerry knees over a box of magazines labeled TRUE CRIME $1.00, he flips through an issue, tosses it back. 
Bill leans against the wall next to him, sipping a hot cup of coffee. 
The girls return from the bathroom. Jerry jumps up with excitement. 
JERRY Great, you're back. Let's go. We already paid for the tickets. 
DENISE Tickets for what? 
JERRY This isn't everything. Get ready for this... there's a Museum of Murder and Mayhem. 
DENISE I don't want to see that. 
MARY How about if we skip it and just hang out here. I can get some great shots of this stuff. 
Jerry PULLS Denise over and puts his arm around her. 
JERRY Aw, come on. It will be fun. 
DENISE Oh yeah, murder museum... sounds fun. 
Bill grabs Mary by the hand and kisses it. 
BILL (smiling) We'll need pictures of the inside too. 
MARY Alright, alright. I know... I wanted to be the photographer. 
Bill and Mary kiss. 
Spaulding waits, unamused. He rolls his eyes. 
CAPT. SPAULDING Anytime this year, people. Alright line your asses up in front of the black door. The tour is about to begin. 
Spaulding disappears through a curtain behind the counter. The kids wait. 
The black metal door CREAKS open. 
They enter the darkened room. 
INT. SPAULDING'S - MUSEUM - NIGHT 
Darkness. A blue light comes on. Spaulding is standing on a MOTORIZED PLATFORM. He begins the tour, speaking through a small megaphone. 
CAPT. SPAULDING Ladies and gentlemen, you are about to enter a world of darkness. A world where life and death are meaningless and pain is God. (pointing with a cane) To your left you see the infamous Albert Fish. 
A lifeless wax figure POPS forward with a loud metal CLANG. Mary jumps back with fright. 
CAPT. SPAULDING Sadist, masochist, child killer and most of all importantly cannibal. Born in 1870, Mr. Fish enjoyed burning himself with hot pokers, spankings with nail-studded paddles and embedding needles in his groin. On the right, notice the X-ray... 
CLOSE UP - X-RAY 
CAPT. SPAULDING ...showing clearly 29 sewing needles inserted in to his groin. Mr. Fish was executed in 1936 at the age of 
Spaulding rolls backwards and continues the tour. 
CLOSE UP ON: a dummy face of a grizzly looking old man in hunting attire. 
CAPT. SPAULDING To your right. One of our most popular crazies, the psycho of Plainfield, Ed Gein. 
Behind the figure of Gein hangs an inverted corpse of a slain woman. 
Mary recoils in disgust. 
CAPT. SPAULDING Murderer, cannibal and momma's little bitch boy. Mr. Gein found special pleasure in playing with the dead bodies of women, especially their sexual organs. He was quite a handy little dandy, fashioning lamp shades, jewelry and human skin suits from his victims. Mr. Gein was discovered when the decapitated body of Bernice Worden was found gutted like a deer, hanging in his barn.

A wax figure of a young man in doctor's scrubs. He is covered in blood. 
BABY Maybe, maybe, maybe... hey, you know what word I hate? 
JERRY What? 
BABY Cone. 
JERRY Huh... what cone? 
BABY Any cone, yeah... (looking out the window) I hate that word... sounds ugly, I don't like crumple either. 
JERRY I always hate saying the word cheese, every time you get your picture taken... smile, say cheese. 
BABY I know I hate Swiss cheese, the holes make me nervous. 
BILL What about the tree? 
BABY Oh yeah, the tree. 
MARY This is crazy. She don't know nothing. 
Baby turns her attention toward Mary. 
BABY Oh, I know. I'll show you where it's at, sweetie. Aren't you just so cute all bundled up like a cinnamon roll of Christmas love. 
JERRY Cool. 
BILL Which way? 
BABY Go straight up about another mile... til we hit Cherrypicker Road and turn right... it ain't far from there. 
INT. MENTAL HOSPITAL 
The camera FLOATS through the hallways of the Peabody Mental Institution. It is HALLOWEEN. 
PATIENTS wander the stark halls dressed in hospital gowns and cheap plastic masks. Some are laughing, some are screaming. 
We move into a private room. Where we see DOCTOR SATAN completely covered except for his eyes, hovering over a BOUND AND GAGGED PATIENT. 
We move off the doctor to a crayon child's DRAWING of a JACK- O'-LANTERN. Tortured screams fill the room. 
EXT. CHERRYPICKER RD. - WOODS - NIGHT 
From a STRANGER'S POV we see the car STRUGGLING down a dirt road. 
INT. CAR - SAME 
Everyone rides in silence, music plays on the radio. 
The song ends and a NEWS REPORTER comes on. 
NEWS REPORTER (V.O.) This is WJRC News at the top of the hour... Investigators in Clairemont County are no closer to identifying the body of a young woman found crucified to the doors of St. Mary's Church yesterday morning. 
Baby lights up a cigarette and takes a drag. 
MARY Excuse me, could you not smoke in here? 
Baby puts out the cigarette on the back of her hand. 
NEWS REPORTER (V.O.) Local police and State Officials have released this report... 
JERRY What's that? 
BILL I don't know. Looks like some kind of animal. 
Bill stops the car. 
EXT. CHERRYPICKER RD. - WOODS - NIGHT 
Sitting dead center in the middle of the road is a HUMONGOUS DOG. The dog stares straight ahead. Long strands of drool hang from its mouth to the ground. 
INT. CAR - NIGHT 
MARY Why are we stopping? 
BILL There's a dog in the road. 
DENISE Honk at him. Scare him. 
Baby is leaning on her chin staring at Mary and Denise. The car radio plays in the background. 
MARY Can I help you with something? 
BABY I was just wondering. 
MARY Wondering what? 
BABY Are you two gals all funny with each other? 
MARY What? 
BABY You know... a couple of queers. 
MARY Do you believe this fucking girl? 
BABY (turning her attention to Mary) I was just wondering, cause you got a pissy look about you... like a real pussy licking bitch. 
Denise tries to QUICKLY defuse the situation. 
DENISE No. No pussy licking here, but thanks for your concern. 
Bill and Jerry slide back into the car. 
BILL Well, I got some bad news and some bad news. 
MARY What? 
JERRY (fake Scottish accent) Tire's fucking gone crap on us, man. There's no saving it now. 
BILL And the spare is safely sitting in Jerry's garage. 
DENISE For fucking sake Jerry, what the fuck are we gonna do? 
Baby starts laughing. 
MARY What the hell are you laughing about? 
BABY I just pictured the tire sitting in a chair watching TV. 
MARY Oh, wonderful. (muttering to herself) Fucking psycho. 
BILL I guess I'll try to back it out on the rim... at least to the main road. 
BABY If you keep going straight you can get back on the interstate... it's easier. 
MARY Just back up. 
JERRY I think we should go straight. I mean we know for a fact there ain't nothing back that way, right? 
BABY Oh wait! I love this song! 
Baby reaches over and TURNS UP the VOLUME. She loudly sings along with the song. 
BILL Fine. I'll go straight. 
MARY What! 
BILL (over the loud music) Fine! I'll go straight! 
The car moves forward. After about fifty yards the car HITS something hard and gets stuck in a deep mud bog. 
BILL Fuck! We are fucked! 
DENISE Turn that fucking radio off! 
Bill shuts off the radio. 
DENISE Now what are we gonna do? 
BABY We can walk to my house from here. My brother's got a tow truck, he can come get your car. 
A silence falls over the car. 
MARY I think I'm going fucking crazy. 
DENISE I can't believe... 
MARY What! 
DENISE Jesus Christ. 
MARY I think I'm gonna have a fucking heart attack. 
JERRY (Scottish accent) OK lassies, I think it's time you get to gripping reality. 
MARY Enough with the stupid voices. 
The brute man attaches the chain to the car and begins raising it with his truck. 
A SIGN on the side of the truck reads FIREFLY TOWING. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
CLOSE UP - TV SCREEN 
We are watching a scene from THE OLD DARK HOUSE. GLORIA STUART, RAYMOND MASSEY and MELVYN DOUGLAS are standing in the rain pounding on a huge wooden door. 
GLORIA STUART Knock again louder. 
MELVYN DOUGLAS I should of thought that was loud enough to wake the dead... that's an idea. 
RAYMOND MASSEY What is? 
MELVYN DOUGLAS Wouldn't it be dramatic, supposing the people inside were dead. All stretched out with the lights quietly burning about them. 
GLORIA STUART I'm sure it would be very amusing. 
We pull back from the TV to see Bill's clothes drying by the fireplace. Bill, now wearing overalls and a flannel shirt, is sitting on an old over stuffed sofa. 
BILL So, you live here alone... I mean with just your brother? 
BABY (speaking from the next room) No. There's a bunch a us 'round somewhere... I think Mamma's sleepin'. She sleeps a lot, now... do you want marshmallows? 
BILL Um, yeah sure, I guess. 
BABY You sure do a lot of guessing. 
Baby sets down the tray, making sure to bend over close to Bill. She hands him his drink and sits down next to him. 
BILL Thank you. 
BABY You're welcome. 
Baby moves closer to Bill, he begins to get nervous. 
BILL Hey, um... (pointing to the mounted animal head over the fireplace) ...what kind of animal is that? 
BABY A dead one. 
BILL (sipping his drink) Mmmmm, this is tasty. 
BABY (scoops out some marshmallow with her finger) Ain't the only thing tasty in this house. (licks it off) 
BILL I wonder what time it is. Seems kind of late. 
BABY Don't worry, sugar. It ain't past my bedtime... are you flirting with me? 
BILL What? No, I'm was worried that... I was just wondering what's taking so long. 
BABY Oh. Maybe R.J. got into a crash and killed everbody? 
BILL That's not something to joke about. 
BABY (rolls her eyes) OK, sorry... maybe the Great Pumpkin ate 'em up. 
Finally, the SOUND OF A TRUCK pulling up can be HEARD. 
Bill jumps up and goes to the window. 
BILL Hey, great they're back. 
BABY (sarcastically) Whoopie fucking doo. 
TV SCREEN - SAME 
JERRY Well, I thought I'd maybe take in a hoedown. 
MOTHER (flirting) Oh, really... (puts her hand on Jerry's knee and winks) ...well, I'm a pretty good dancer if you know what I mean... I bet I got a few moves you ain't never seen. 
JERRY I don't doubt that. 
DENISE No, he's just joking. We don't really have any plans other than spending the night at my Dad's house... (glances at Jerry) ...which is where we were headed when our car broke down. 
MOTHER That's nice. 
DENISE Yeah, I guess I'll just help him hand out candy to the trick or treaters. 
JERRY And I'm gonna help put the razor blades in the candy apples. 
MOTHER I'll bet you are... you are a naughty little thing aren't ya. 
JERRY I was just kidding. 
Bill and Mary snicker at Jerry's comments. Denise tries to keep a straight face. 
MOTHER Oh, I get it... I guess you think you're too good for the simple pleasures of Halloween. 
MARY No, just a little too old. 
MOTHER Oh really, well I hope something changes your mind some day. 
Baby returns from the garage. 
BABY Tiny's home. 
MOTHER What about R.J.? 
BABY Oh, he was already gone before I seen him... but Tiny saw him and said he said he was going out to the yard to get a new wheel. 
BILL The yard, what's that? 
MOTHER It's an old auto junkyard out in Baldwin. 
DENISE How long is that gonna take? 
MOTHER He should be back in a couple hours. 
MARY A couple hours! 
DENISE Can't Tiny drive us to a phone? 
Mother and Baby laugh. 
MOTHER (laughing) Tiny ain't got no car, he ain't even got a bicycle. 
DENISE How's he get around out here? 
BABY He walks, duh. 
MARY Fucking great. 
MOTHER I know you're my guests and welcome but I'd please advise you to keep from cussing while in my house, thank you. 
MARY Sorry. 
MOTHER Well, even though I know it seems childish to you all. Tonight is Halloween eve and it special to us so you are all invited to stay for dinner. 
Under the circumstances they realize they have no choice. They grin and bear it. 
DENISE Thank you. 
JERRY (imitates Elvis) Yes, thank you. Thank you very much. 
MOTHER (Mother touches Jerry's shoulder suggestively) You're a strange one, aren't ya honey. I think you and me are get on like... (she thinks for a second) ...like something real good. 
Camera moves over to the TV. THE END fades up on screen. Dr. Wolfenstein appears over the credits. 
DR. WOLFENSTEIN There well, who knew there was love to be found in The Old Dark House. Coming up next, do not move a muscle, an artery or a vein as we venture into another creepy classic... are you ready for THE WOLFMAN, baby? 
INT. HOUSE - DINING ROOM 
Bill, Jerry, Mary and Denise are now all seated around a large dining room table. A thick mountain of candles sits burning dead center on the table, giving off a warm glow. Dozens of Halloween decorations dangle from strings over the table, spiders, bats and black cats. 
We follow Mother inside. 
Thousands of red Christmas lights hang down, strung through the rotting wood rafters. Crates, barrels and an odd assortment of chairs face a large quilted curtain. Filling these seats are LIFELESS DUMMIES. 
MOTHER Please be seated. 
Mother motions toward four empty seats in the front row. 
JERRY (whispering) This is way too fucked up for words. 
MARY (loud whisper) I know the words... fucking psycho fucking bullshit, that's the words. 
BILL Just grin and bear it. 
DENISE That food... (holding stomach) ugh, I feel like I'm gonna puke. 
Jerry, Bill, Mary and Denise take their seats. 
Mary flips open the program. Inside, written in crayon, are the words: HALLOWEEN EXTRAVAGANZA -- starring the Comedy Legend GRAMPA and the World Famous BABY. 
MARY (to Bill) Check this out. 
BILL Well, ya can't complain I never take you anyplace. 
The sound of a warped crackling record fills the room. Lounge music. 
A small spotlight hits the quilted curtain covering the stage. Mother Firefly stands behind the controls. 
She is smiling proudly. 
The curtain clumsily parts TO REVEAL: 
A stage set pieced together from amusement park wreckage. 
A giant painted plywood devil looms over the stage, surrounded by dancing skeletons and demon girls. 
A microphone stands center stage. 
BILL (quietly) I can't believe what I'm seeing. 
JERRY I know, this is fucking nuts. 
MARY This is starting to make me real uncomfortable. 
BILL Just sit back and enjoy the show. 
The sound of CANNED APPLAUSE fills the room. Bill begins to applaud, Jerry and Denise join in. Mary does not. 
GRAMPA (V.O.) Ladies and gentlemen, straight from his smash six week sold out run at Tiki-Ti Club... the Stardust lounge is proud to present Mr. Sexy himself... Grampa Hugo. 
Grampa walks out to center stage, mic in hand and begins to speak. 
GRAMPA Hey, let me tell ya a story... so I'm hanging out with my buddy Hal Jackowictz and I'm like, hey Hal let's go get some booze and chase the chickens... fucking Hal says no, no the old battle axe at home will break my balls... I gotta get my ass home. 
The kids stare in shock at Grampa. Jerry begins to laugh. 
GRAMPA So, I tell 'im... Hal, here's the secret. Go home tonight, crawl into bed, get under the covers and eat your wife's pussy... I mean jam your face right in the bush. 
Jerry starts to giggle. 
DENISE (quietly) What are you laughing at? 
JERRY I don't know, I think he's funny. 
DENISE This isn't funny, it's twisted. 
GRAMPA So, Hal goes home, jumps in, starts chomping and licking away at her pussy, she's screaming and howling... totally passes out from the experience. 
MARY Dear God, let this end. 
GRAMPA Now, Hal... He's feeling pretty good, so he goes into the bathroom for a quick shave... (pauses) ...suddenly he lets out a horrible scream. Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh! 
The recorded crowd chuckles. 
GRAMPA Sitting there on the toilet is Hal's wife Gloria... and she says, "Quiet down, you'll wake Grandma!" 
The recorded crowd screams with laughter, as does Jerry. Bill, Denise and Mary look at him like he's crazy. 
MARY Don't worry, I'm gone. 
EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT 
Bill, Jerry, Denise and Mary climb back into their car. 
BILL Don't look back, just get in the car. 
DENISE Lock the fucking doors. 
INT. CAR - NIGHT 
Bill begins to pull the car down the long dirt driveway towards the road. The heavy rain makes visibility difficult. 
BILL (straining to see through the darkness) Almost there. 
JERRY Jesus, you think she was really gonna cut you? 
MARY (leaning her forehead on the window) Of course she was gonna cut me, she's a fucking nut... (closes her eyes and takes a breath) I knew she was crazy from the second we picked her up. 
SLAM! Suddenly, Baby pounds her fist against Mary's window. Mary jumps back in terror. 
BABY (screaming) You're in Hell, bitch! You're gonna die like a dog! 
Baby disappears into the darkness. 
MARY Go! Go! Go! Get us out of here! 
Bill pulls the car up to the front gate. It is chained shut with a huge padlock. 
LIGHTNING CRASHES, illuminating the crucified scarecrows. 
FLASH CLOSE-UP CUTS - of grinning jack-o-lantern faces peer down from above. 
INT. CAR - NIGHT 
Bill opens the car door, starts to get out. 
MARY (hysterical) What are you doing! 
BILL I gotta open the gate. 
MARY Drive through it! 
BILL It won't work. 
JERRY Holy fuck, hurry up. 
Jerry, Mary and Denise watch through the windshield as Bill struggles to unlatch the thick iron gates. 
SUDDENLY, one of the SCARECROWS JUMPS down from his cross and SMASHES Bill over the head with a HEAVY CLUB. Bill drops to his knees. 
MARY Bill! Help him! 
Jerry throws open his door to get out. He's SHOVED BACK into the car by another, larger scarecrow outside his door. This scarecrow begins smashing the car's windows with a METAL PIPE. 
Bill lays motionless, face down in the mud. His attacker turns his attention on the car. He also begins smashing the car's windows. 
EXT. CAR - NIGHT 
From a distance we see Jerry pulled from the car and beaten. The girls are helplessly trapped inside the destroyed vehicle. The scarecrows continue to pound on the car. 
As we fade out, the sound of a BARKING DOG can be heard. 
FADE TO: 
EXT. FARMHOUSE - MAGIC 
From a long shot, we see the farmhouse in the early morning sunrise. All is still. 
The sound of an engine starting breaks the early morning silence. Rufus's tow truck is seen pulling away from behind the house. The BEATEN REMAINS of Bill's car are towed behind it. 
EXT. WILLIS HOUSE - SUNRISE 
Darkness, except for the face of an alarm clock. The time is 7:00 AM. TICK, TICK, TICK... BUZZZZZZ. The alarm goes off. 
A hand reaches over and turns off the alarm. We hear a deep groan. A light turns on. 
Whoosh! He pulls her through the curtains. From behind the curtain we hear Mary SCREAMING and Otis LAUGHING. 
MARY (behind curtain) Bill? No, no, no! What have you done? Bill! 
INT. CURTAIN ROOM - OTIS'S ROOM - DAY 
Ugliness. Decay. Pain. Carefully arranged on a model's platform is the severed torso of Bill sewn to a large homemade fish tail. He is lying on his ride side posing. 
Bill's face is frozen in a death scream. 
OTIS Behold... The Fish-Boy! 
MARY (repeating to herself) This can't be real, this can't be real, this can't be real. 
OTIS Oh, it's real... as real as I want it to be, mamma... (grabs his canvas and holds it in her face) ...look, see the magic in my brush strokes. 
Painted on the canvas is the gruesome scene of Bill as the Fish-Boy. 
MARY (crying) Fuck you, you fucking freak! 
OTIS Oh, come now... we're all creatures of God and freaks in our own way... (twitches and shakes) ...but if you'll notice... (points to a blank spot in the painting) right here, needs a little something, heh? 
Otis slowly puts down the canvas, turns and picks up a huge hunting knife. 
MARY What are you doing? (squirming) ...no, stop... please, please. 
OTIS You, my dear worm feeder, are about to become immortalized. 
Otis draws back the knife. 
MARY (screaming) Noooooooooooo! 
Otis swings the knife forward, directly into the camera. 
CLOSE UP - CLOWN FACE 
Ravelli's clown head bobs back and forth. 
PULL BACK TO: 
Ravelli, wearing his clown head, stands by the road side waving to passing cars. 
EXT. SPAULDING'S - DAY 
A police car drives past Ravelli and comes to a stop. OFFICER GEORGE WYDELL, 42, a big, slightly paunchy man with a big mustache and mirrored sunglasses, steps from his car. 
Following close behind, OFFICER STEVE NAISH, 29, tall athletic. 
WYDELL (pauses, looks around, pulls up his belt) Well, let's go see if the nut that runs this place can help us. 
NAISH Right. 
They walk to the door. 
INT. SPAULDING'S - DAY 
The door swings open. Wydell enters slowly, putting on his best cowboy attitude. Naish follows suit. 
Wydell, hands on his belt, struts up to the counter. 
No one is around. 
A rusted bell sits on the counter, taped to it is a handwritten note, "ring for service". Wydell rings it once, waits, no response. Rings it again, waits, no response. 
NAISH (looking around the room) Get a load of all this crap... this is one sick place. 
Wydell begins ringing the bell non-stop. 
Spaulding shouts from the backroom. 
CAPT. SPAULDING Whoever's a jerking off on that bell better be gone when I get out there... 'cause I'm gonna rip your nuts off. 
Spaulding enters from behind the curtain, angry. He sees the troopers and puts on a phony grin. 
CAPT. SPAULDING Officers, officers what can I do for you today? I ain't fried up the birds yet... if that's what you're ring a ding dinging about. 
WYDELL (pulls a paper from his pocket) What I need are some answers. (unfolds the paper to reveal a picture of Denise) 
Bill's car is down in a ditch, run off the side of the road. 
INT. POLICE CAR - MIDDAY 
Naish checks the license plate number with his sheet. 
NAISH Plates match. 
WYDELL Call the chief... We found 'em. 
EXT. PINK PUSSY CAT LIQUORS - MIDDAY 
A small, crummy liquor store stands next to a sleazy motel. A filthy looking hooker leads her customer to a waiting room, a homeless bum stands screaming obscenities in the parking lot. 
INT. PINK PUSSY CAT LIQUORS - MIDDAY 
The store is decorated for Halloween. 
Off to one side is a curtained room. A sign reads "XXX 8mm loops", sex noises can be heard inside. 
Baby and Rufus stand at the counter waiting for the CASHIER, a skinny geek with glasses, to total up their purchases. The counter is loaded with bottles. 
The cashier is packing the bottles into cardboard boxes. 
CASHIER You all having a Halloween party tonight? 
BABY Now, what makes you think that? 
CASHIER You all sure are buying a lot of holy water for two people. 
BABY Yeah, well we like to get fucked up and do fucked up shit, you know what I mean? 
CASHIER Yeah, yeah... (giggling) ...I like to fuck shit up. 
BABY I'll bet you do... how much we owe ya... (looks at his name tag) ...Goober? 
CASHIER (looking down at his tag) Actually it's G. Ober... Gerry Ober, but the guys drew in the other O, fucking assholes. 
BABY (uninterested) Great story Goober, how much? 
CASHIER Ummmm... two hundred and eighty-five dollars. 
Baby throws down three hundred dollars. 
BABY Keep the change and get yourself a new name. 
CASHIER Holy crap, thanks! 
Rufus picks up the boxes from the counter. He and Baby start to walk away. 
BABY Come on, bro. Let's go. 
CASHIER (holding out a flyer) Hey, wait take this. 
Baby stops and grabs the flyer. 
BABY What's this? 
CASHIER A missing girl. I use'ta go to school with her, she just up and disappeared some day... real weird. 
The flyer reads MISSING, KAREN MURPHY, 18. The picture on the flyer shows the smiling chubby face of a young girl. 
BABY Now isn't she a happy little cherub... oh well (stuffs it in her pocket) ...nobody just up and disappears. 
RUFUS JR. (mutters) Aliens. 
BABY Yeah, maybe it was fucking aliens. 
EXT. PINK PUSSY CAT LIQUOR - MIDDAY 
Baby and Rufus exit. Rufus loads the boxes into the back of the truck. Baby sits on the curb and lights a cigarette. 
EXT. CHERRYPICKER ROAD - WOODS - MIDDAY 
Bill's car is now sitting in the middle of the road. The back is attached to a police tow truck. An additional police cruiser arrives on the scene. 
Sheriff Huston steps out from his cruiser. 
Tiny begins preparing her food, carefully pouring the cereal and milk into the bowl. He stirs it with the spoon. 
Tiny gently lifts Denise's head and feeds her like a baby. Denise swallows the food, trying not to choke. After a few spoonfuls Tiny stands up and walks over to a dark corner of the room. 
He pulls a string and turns on a swinging ceiling light. In the light we see a rusty cage, inside are three rail-thin female bodies. 
Tiny throws the remainder of the cereal into the cage. 
One of the bodies moves to eat the scraps, the others do not. They are dead. 
Tiny turns off the overhead light. 
INT. POLICE CAR - LATE AFTERNOON 
Wydell and Naish are pulling into a large truck stop parking lot. 
NAISH You sure this guy's supposed to ride with us? Seems kind of weird. 
WYDELL (scanning the parking lot) Chief said pick him up and take him with us on our house to house. Guy's an ex-cop, thinks he can help. 
NAISH Sounds like a bad idea to me, probally just get in the way. 
WYDELL Yeah, well I guess it's tough to sit on the sidelines and wait when your own kid's missing... besides, ain't no such thing as an ex-cop. 
NAISH I guess not. 
WYDELL That must be him. 
EXT. GAS STATION - LATE AFTERNOON 
A rundown gas station sits off to the side of the road. 
A filthy mechanic works on one of the many junked cars. 
Two fat greasy men sit in the hot sun playing cards. 
A Chevy Nova sits parked next to the station. Willis leans against the side of the car, drinking coffee from a styrofoam cup. 
A police cruiser pulls up. Wydell and Naish step from the car. 
WYDELL Mr. Willis? 
MR. WILLIS Yes, sir. 
WYDELL I'm Wydell... this is Naish. 
Wydell extends his hand, they shake hands. 
NAISH Hey. 
MR. WILLIS George Willis... (to Wydell) ...any leads? 
WYDELL Well, we were on our way out to run a check on a couple farmhouses out on the edge of town... closest thing we got to a lead at this point. 
MR. WILLIS That's it? 
WYDELL Well, all we know is the kids were headed out to a spot the locals call Deadwood to play Nancy Drew with some local legend about this character everybody calls Dr. Satan. 
MR. WILLIS Dr. Satan? 
NAISH Yeah it's horseshit, just some boogieman crap that the kids like to scare each other with. 
WYDELL Anyway, there's not much else out that way... so, I figure maybe there's a chance the kids broke down and found their way over to one of the farms. 
MR. WILLIS What about the body you found? 
WYDELL (slightly surprised) Oh, yeah, you know about that? Hmmm, that's a strange one. 
NAISH Local girl, Karen Murphy, been missing for a couple months, figured for a runaway. 
MR. WILLIS Fit the profile? 
NAISH No, not really. Good kid, never been in any trouble. 
WYDELL Her part in this I can't figure... but I will. 
MR. WILLIS (wipes his brow) Christ, you know it's crazy... (gets choked up) I lived through so many other people's nightmares, you know. Always cool and calm, but... but I never thought I'd be the one needing help, ya know? 
OTIS What! God damn, how many? 
GRAMPA (watching TV) What? How many? 
OTIS Don't worry about it. 
Otis jumps up and goes over to an old dresser and opens a drawer and pulls out an automatic revolver. 
MOTHER I don't know. I only saw one. 
OTIS I'm sure there's more than that... fucking pigs always travel in packs... (handing the gun to Mother) ...here, take this. 
MOTHER (takes the gun) What should I do? 
OTIS Go down stairs and play nice... I'm a gonna go 'round back and handle things like I always fucking do. 
EXT. FARMHOUSE - SAME 
Naish and Willis move through the cluttered back yard of garbage. 
NAISH Shit, don't these packrat hillbillies throw anything away? 
MR. WILLIS Shhhh... you hear that? 
The soft sound of moaning can be heard. 
NAISH Yeah, I hear it... where's it coming from? 
MR. WILLIS Over here, inside the smokehouse. 
Naish and Willis stand in front of a brick smokehouse. The thick door is chained shut. 
NAISH (knocking on door) Anybody in there? 
The moaning gets louder. 
MR. WILLIS We gotta break it open. 
NAISH I ain't got a warrant. 
Willis picks up a broken axe handle and begins prying open the door. 
MR. WILLIS Tell it to my daughter. 
NAISH (grabbing hold to help) Shit... fuck procedure. 
Together they struggle to open the door. 
INT. FARMHOUSE - SAME 
Mother slowly opens the front door. The revolver is behind her back, tucked in her apron strings. 
MOTHER (trying to be sexy) Well hello, officer. 
WYDELL (holding up his badge) Excuse me, I'm sorry for disturbing you this fine afternoon. 
MOTHER Aw, you ain't disturbing me, but it kind of looks like rain, don't ya think? 
WYDELL My name is Lt. Wydell, I'd like to ask you a few questions. 
MOTHER Questions? Well, heck, I'll tell you anything you want to know. 
WYDELL I appreciate your cooperation. I'm looking for a missing girl... (holds up picture) ...this girl here, Denise Willis... have you seen her? 
MOTHER Well, I... mmmmm... no, I ain't seen her, sorry. 
She begins to close the door. Wydell stops her. 
WYDELL Please, could I please come in and talk to you for a minute? Maybe you could take a better look at the picture... might stir up something. 
MOTHER I um... no, I don't think so... 
WYDELL Please, just a minute. 
MOTHER Oh, alright... I guess I can trust you... being a man of the law and all. 
She opens the door. 
OTIS Interlock your fingers behind your head... (Naish hesitates) ...do it! 
Naish obeys. 
OTIS Kneel. 
Naish kneels down. 
From a distance we see Otis standing over Naish, execution style. A white puff of smoke comes from Otis's gun and a distant popping sound is heard. Naish falls over on his side. 
The scene fades to blood red. 
EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT 
The house stands silent in the darkness. Lightning crashes, a heavy rain falls. 
Burning JACK-O'-LANTERNS beam from every window. Smoke rises from the chimney. 
It is Halloween night. 
INT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT 
CLOSE-UP TV 
Dr. Wolfenstein is on screen smashing pumpkins with a giant hammer. 
DR. WOLFENSTEIN It is midnight my little boils and ghouls, the witching hour. Time for all monsters, murderers, maniacs and madmen to go to work... so lock your doors and bolt your windows, sit back and prepare for a fright night classic... (lightning crashes) ...The House of Frankenstein. 
The movie begins and we move off the TV to see: 
Hundreds of CANDLES are lit, illuminating everything with a flickering light. Music blares from a cheap stereo. BLACK and ORANGE PAPER STREAMERS are draped from ceiling to floor. 
Dead center is a LARGE OBJECT standing seven feet tall, it is completely covered in paper Halloween decorations. A long chain connects the object up into the rafters. 
This is the Halloween party from Hell. 
An intoxicated Grampa, dressed as FLASH GORDON, sits in his wheelchair watching the TV, drinking MOONSHINE from an unmarked bottle. 
GRAMPA (slurred drunken yelling at the screen) Get those motherfucker... those high water bitches and rocketship daisies... kill 'em, kill 'em. 
CRASH! CRASH! CRASH! Tiny stands in a corner tunelessly banging on a large oil drum. He is dressed like a low budget BATMAN, in grey long johns and a black bat mask and cape. 
A drunk Rufus, wearing a bloody police uniform, stands on a table SHOUTING along to the music through a POLICE MEGAPHONE. 
Mother and Baby, both dressed as SUPERHEROES, dance around the covered object. Both are swigging moonshine from jugs. 
RUFUS JR. (shouting through megaphone) Show me, show me, show me, show me! 
Mother and Baby start TEARING AWAY the paper covering from the object in the middle of the room. They RIP at the paper, spinning and dancing around in a wild pagan ritual. 
As the shreds of colored paper fall to the floor we see: Denise, Jerry and Mary tied back to back hanging from the chain, each are dressed in a different animal costume. Denise is a pig, Jerry is a donkey and Mary is a rabbit. They are gagged. 
Mother and Baby laugh at their helpless victims, splashing moonshine in their faces. 
BABY Drink up, it's party time. 
MOTHER Enjoy your last night... (looking around) ...where's Otis? 
BABY Oh, he's coming, he got something real special this year. 
Rufus jumps down, begins to spin the bound captives around and around. 
RUFUS JR. Otis, Otis, Otis, Otis! 
MOTHER Quiet, quiet, you know he won't come down with all this hoop-dee-doo bouncing off the walls. Now, calm down. 
GRAMPA I shot an elephant in my pajamas this morning... how he got in my pajamas I'll never know. 
BABY Grampa, shhhhhhhh. 
GRAMPA Then we tried to remove the tusks, but they were embedded in so firmly that we couldn't budge 'em. 
MOTHER (gesturing at Grampa) Let him finish. 
GRAMPA Of course, in Alabama the Tuscaloosa, but that's entirely irrelephant. 
The room goes silent. All eyes are focused on the stairs. 
EXT. FIELD - NIGHT 
The rain pounds down. A heavy fog hovers over the dense growth of the field. In the distance, silhouetted by moonlight, a gruesome caravan slowly moves through the night. 
Otis, lantern in hand, leads the way. Followed by Baby and Mother together under a large black umbrella. Next Rufus holds the leash connected to Jerry, Denise and Mary. 
Bringing up the rear, Tiny, shotgun focused on the prisoners, and Grampa. Grampa is strapped to Tiny's back like a child. He waves a flashlight back and forth like a search beam. 
The group comes to a halt at a huge wooden structure. 
OTIS (handing Baby the lantern) Hold this. Point it over here. 
Baby directs the light at Otis. We see that he is trying to unlock a huge padlock attached to an iron door embedded in the base of the wooden structure. 
Otis unlocks the door and swings it open. He reaches down into the blackness and pulls up an iron hook and wench, attached to the hook is a chain. 
Otis parts a section of the overgrown grass next to the pit to reveal a rusty metal crank. He begins to turn the crank. Slowly, from out of the pit, rises a coffin hanging from the end of the chain. 
Otis pulls the coffin over and lays it flat on the ground. He flips open the lid. 
OTIS Hey happy-boy, step your ass up here. 
Rufus cuts loose Jerry, but holds him steady by the neck. 
BABY Take his gag out, it's more fun with the screaming. 
MOTHER Yeah, I like the screaming too... it's so much more exciting. 
Rufus cuts loose the gag. 
JERRY Please don't kill us, please don't kill us. 
BABY (imitating Jerry) Please don't kill us, please don't kill us. 
OTIS Bitch, shut your mouth and get your shit in the box. 
JERRY Let us go, please... let the girls go. 
BABY (imitating Jerry) Let us go, please... let the girls go. 
Otis pulls out a gun and points it at Jerry. 
OTIS Get in... now! 
MOTHER Wait, I want to say good-bye. 
Mother grabs Jerry by the collar and gives him a big kiss. 
MOTHER Bye sweety, we could of been great together. 
JERRY Please, let us go, we won't tell anybody. 
MOTHER Aw, honey you know I can't do that. 
BABY We won't tell anybody. 
Otis cocks the pistol. Jerry starts to slowly move towards the coffin. 
OTIS Christ, ain't this fucking a hoot... alright mamma, I ain't got all fucking night. 
JERRY Please, please this is insane. You can't do this. 
Rufus pushes Jerry into the coffin. 
OTIS It is and I can... next. 
Denise starts kicking and fighting with Rufus. Rufus tries to hold her steady, when suddenly Mary breaks free and starts to run. 
OTIS (laughs and raises his pistol) Where's she think she's a gonna get to? She's gonna run all the way home. 
BABY No! Let me get her... (turns to Mother) ...Ma, Otis is having all the fun... can I get her? 
MOTHER That's true, Otis... not that we're having a bad time, but... 
OTIS (rolls his eyes) Well, go get her. 
Baby jumps with excitement and runs off across the field after Mary. 
EXT. BACKYARD - NIGHT 
Behind the farmhouse is a camouflage jungle, an intricate system of ropes and netting is strung together to hide the many automobiles beneath. 
Rufus moves through the jungle. He stops and begins to remove the netting from a car, it is Wydell's police cruiser. He climbs inside the car, puts on Wydell's policeman's hat and starts the engine. He drives off. 
INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT 
Rufus is driving like a maniac through the open farmland. He turns on the overhead flashing lights. 
EXT. FIELDS - NIGHT 
The police cruiser twists and turns in the barren fields. 
INT. PIT - NIGHT 
Denise stands knee deep in the sludge. Broken bits of the coffin's remains are scattered around her. 
DENISE Jerry please answer me. 
A soft moaning sound is heard coming from the other end of the pit. 
DENISE Jerry... (moving slowly forward) ...is that you? 
Denise cautiously makes her way to the bend at the end of the tunnel. As she approaches, the moaning sound gets louder. She turns the corner to see: 
TWO PALE FIGURES in filthy hospital gowns hunched over a shadowy object. Denise gasps. They turn towards Denise, revealing the partially devoured dead body of Jerry. 
The two bone-white ghouls are dripping with Jerry's blood, they stare at Denise, then return to their prey. 
Denise screams in horror and runs, turning down another twist in the underground maze. She turns the corner and runs straight into SEVERAL SLOW MOVING GHOULS. The ghouls are of the same deathly white complexion, hair-less with flaked, cracking skin. Their yellow eyes shine in the darkness. 
They reach for her, but she breaks free and continues to run into the endless stretch of tunnels before her. 
EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT 
Primitive wooden crosses form a circle around a burnt piece of land, approximately twenty feet in diameter. 
Laying flat in the center is the large stake, Mary's body is draped across it. Tiny is securing her to the stake with rope. 
INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT 
Through the windshield, we see Baby jumping and dancing in the fields with several large dogs. She is firing a gun as she dances. 
EXT. FIELD - NIGHT 
Baby sees the car and raises her gun. She aims it at the car driver. She waits, as the car gets closer she sees the face of Rufus behind the wheel. She lowers the gun and begins to laugh. 
The car stops and Baby climbs into the passenger's seat. The car drives off. 
EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT 
Tiny lifts the stake with Mary firmly strapped in place. He implants it into the ground. Her body hangs like a doll. Tiny opens a gasoline can and begins splashing gas onto the stake. 
EXT. FIELD - NIGHT 
Otis, face painted like a SKULL and wearing a priest's robe, walks solemnly through the tall grass. 
INT. PIT - NIGHT 
Denise, waist high in sludge, wanders lost through the endless tunnels of the pit. In the distance she hears high pitched animal sounds. 
A GHOUL rises up from the sludge behind Denise. It stands silent. It reaches out a BONEY HAND with long curled fingernails and grabs her hair. Denise screams and tries to pull away. The ghoul grabs her with his other hand and pulls her closer, CLAWING at her face. 
Denise fights her way free, but loses her footing and falls backwards, slipping under the sludge. She quickly resurfaces and starts to run. 
EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT 
Otis stands in front of the bound Mary, holding a pumpkin. Otis places the pumpkin over Mary's head. 
Tiny stands behind him holding a lit torch. 
EXT. FIELD - NIGHT 
The police car drives wildly through the fields. 
INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT

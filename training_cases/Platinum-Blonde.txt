PLATINUM BLONDE 
Story by Harry E. Chandlee and Douglas W. Churchill 
FADE IN 
1. INT. CITY ROOM OF NEWSPAPER OFFICE - DAY - FULL SHOT 
General atmosphere, typical of a busy newspaper office. Copy boys running about, shirtsleeved reporters and rewrite men pounding away on typewriters. Little wire baskets containing cylinders of copy whizzing back and forth, such as are used in some department stores, etc. 
SOUND 
(Morkrum machines,[1] typewriters, telephone bells and all other sounds relative to a newspaper office) 
When shot has been fully established: 
CAMERA STARTS TRUCKING DOWN MAIN AISLE 
It takes in the battery of Morkrum machines clattering away; the crescent-shaped copy desk; the desk of the sporting editor, with a big cauliflower-eared pugilist and his manager standing by the side of the sporting editor, a hefty guy in his shirtsleeves, smoking a big cigar and wearing a green eye-shade; the desk of the society editor, a prissy old lady, who takes down a worn copy of the Blue Book as the camera passes her and starts looking up some data; and any other interesting or typical bits that can be thought out. At the far end of the room is the desk of Conroy, the City Editor. 
Everything shows evidence of feverish activity and great haste. 
2. CLOSE SHOT 
On Conroy, the City Editor at his desk, speaking on the telephone. 
CONROY 
Yeah, that's all I ever get from you guys - a lot of hard luck stories. You come back here and I'll give you an assignment. It will be a last interview - with the cashier! 
He hangs up, looks around with a scowl. 
Stew! Stew Smith! 
REPORTER 
Oh Mr. Conroy, give me a crack at that Schuyler story, will you? 
CONROY 
You? If you ever got your foot into a drawing room, you'd step on a sliding rug! Stew is the only man that's got brains enough to handle this. Scram! 
A Copy Boy rushes by on an errand. 
Say Spud, did you find Stew? 
COPY BOY 
Not yet. 
CONROY 
Well, did you look in the 
COPY BOY 
First place I looked. 
CONROY 
Not there, eh? For cryin' out loud, where is that? Go and dig him up! Stew! Stew Smith! 
CAMERA TRUCKS ON: 
Until it takes in a sort of make-shift screen, concealing a corner of the room. 
LAP DISSOLVE TO: 
3. CLOSE SHOT 
On the other side of the screen. Stew Smith is holding something in his hand. His hat tilted back on his head, and he is regarding this plaything intently. Gallagher is sitting close to him, also gazing intently at the plaything. Gallagher is a girl, one of the sob sisters[2] on the newspaper, dressed in a trim but inexpensive little tailored suit. 
STEW 
Here it is. Pray for me, Gallagher. Pray for me. Hold everything . . . 
4. CLOSE SHOT 
On the object in his hand, one of those hand-puzzles where you have to land jumping beans in the holes. 
5. DOUBLE SHOT 
GALLAGHER 
Stew, your hands are shaking. You've been drinking again. 
STEW 
Come on, come on. Here they come, Gallagher! Here they come! 
Conroy's shouts are heard in the background. 
GALLAGHER 
(conspiratorially) 
The boss is getting hoarse. 
STEW 
There's the third one. If I don't get the last one, there's a certain sob sister I know that's going to get a kick right in the . . . oh! Whoops, almost had that. 
6. MED. CLOSE SHOT 
Conroy, the City Editor at his desk, looking about with a scowl for Stew. 
CONROY 
(bellowing) 
Stew! Stew Smith! 
The Copy Boy races over to whisper something to Conroy. 
CONROY 
What? The screen? 
7. CLOSE SHOT 
On Stew Smith 
STEW 
Gallagher! I made it! 
8. MEDIUM SHOT (FROM CONROY'S ANGLE) 
The screen, concealing the washbasin corner. 
CONTINUATION, SCENE 6 
A wrathy Conroy, his eyes centering suspiciously on something. With his eyes on the screen, Conroy reaches out and grasps a heavy telephone book on the corner of his desk. Still looking off, he heaves it forcefully. 
9. MED. CLOSE SHOT 
Showing the screen. The telephone book crashes into it, overturning it and revealing Stew and Gallagher on the other side. They both look up, startled. The newsroom erupts in laughter. 
CONTINUATION, SCENE 6 
Conroy, glaring off fiercely. 
CONROY 
Come over here! 
10. MEDIUM SHOT 
Conroy at his desk. Stew saunters into the scene. 
STEW 
Look, I quit! 
CONROY 
Yeah? 
MRS. SCHUYLER 
(sarcastic) 
If you had to make a fool of yourself, why didn't you tell it to her instead of writing? 
MICHAEL 
Because I couldn't get her on the phone. 
MRS. SCHUYLER 
Imbecile! 
ANNE 
You should have known better than to write, Romeo. I found that out a long time ago. 
MRS. SCHUYLER 
I should say you had. At the rate you two are going, we'll have to leave the country to save our faces. 
ANNE 
Splendid, Mother. Let's hop over to Monte Carlo. It's a great place to save a face. 
MRS. SCHUYLER 
Oh, shut up! 
A butler appears in the doorway. He is about to say something, but he stammers and turns. 
MRS. SCHUYLER 
(stopping him) 
What is it, Smythe? 
SMYTHE 
Pardon me, madam - but what am I to say to the newspapermen? 
Mrs. Schuyler looks distractedly at Grayson. 
17. CLOSER SHOT 
Mrs. Schuyler and Grayson. She rises and speaks imperiously: 
MRS. SCHUYLER 
Dexter, go out and tell those ruffians I have nothing to say. 
Grayson faces her placatingly. 
GRAYSON 
You can't do that. Leave it to me. I know how to handle reporters. 
MRS. SCHUYLER 
(with a shudder) 
All right, then - get it over with. 
18. MEDIUM FULL SHOT 
Grayson turns officiously toward the waiting butler. 
GRAYSON 
We've decided to see the reporters. Send in the man from the Tribune first. 
SMYTHE 
Very good, sir. 
MRS. SCHUYLER 
Oh, Smythe, some bicarbonate of soda, quick - double strength. I know those news mongrels[3] will upset me. 
SMYTHE 
I've anticipated it, madame. The bicarbonate is ready. 
The butler exits. 
19. INT. SCHUYLER LIBRARY - DAY - FULL SHOT 
This room resembles the Grand Central Station. It is lined with bookcases filled with gorgeous first editions and special bindings, and is furnished in the extreme of magnificence and luxury. 
Present are Stew and Bingy, reporter from the Tribune. Stew is seated, idly leafing through a first edition. 
Bingy, still with his hat on, spots an expensive music box on a nearby table, opens it and does a little jig to the tune that is emitted. 
20. CLOSER SHOT 
Bingy, as he lingers at the table. He is a lazy, sloppy-looking guy. His face needs a shave and his pants need pressing. There is a spot of dried ketchup on his tie. On the table is a humidor. Bingy opens it and lifts out a handful of cigars. 
21. CLOSE SHOT - STEW 
As he looks up from the book, he suggests: 
STEW 
Hey Bingy, you'll find the silverware in the dining room. 
CONTINUATION, SCENE 20 
Bingy turns, putting the cigars in his pocket. 
BINGY 
Much obliged. 
22. MEDIUM FULL SHOT 
Smythe enters. 
SMYTHE 
(frigidly) 
Mr. Grayson has decided to see you. 
Both Stew and Bingy start forward eagerly. Smythe continues: 
SMYTHE 
The gentleman from the Tribune, first. 
23. CLOSER THREE SHOT 
Bingy beams broadly and Stew is disappointed. 
STEW 
There are no gentlemen on the Tribune. 
SMYTHE 
I understand, sir. 
Smythe leads the way out. As Bingy passes by, Stew trips him. 
BINGY 
Say, take it easy! Take it easy! Listen, my boy. No use you hanging around here. Just buy the Tribune tonight and read all about it. You can rewrite it for your last edition. 
STEW 
Couldn't make the last edition. It'd take me four hours to translate your story into English. 
BINGY 
Oh, is that so? 
STEW 
BINGY 
Oh yeah? 
28. MEDIUM SHOT 
Grayson and Bingy. He takes Bingy by the arm and leads him over to a corner of the room, assuming a confidential pose. 
GRAYSON 
(speaking as they walk) 
However, I've taken the trouble to prepare a little statement. Here it is. Here. 
29. CLOSER TWO SHOT 
Grayson and Bingy. Grayson takes an envelope out of his pocket and hands it to Bingy. Bingy opens the flap and sees the contents. 
INSERT: ENVELOPE 
The corner of a fifty dollar bill protrudes. 
BACK TO SCENE: 
Bingy quickly shuts the envelope up. Grayson is watching him closely. 
GRAYSON 
So, you see how silly that rumor is? 
BINGY 
Why, sure. It's a lotta hooey. 
GRAYSON 
That's what I wanted to say, but I couldn't think of it. 
Grayson starts leading him toward the door. CAMERA PANS WITH THEM as Grayson leads him toward the door, talking as they walk. 
GRAYSON 
Thank you very much. 
BINGY 
All right, all right, don't mention it. 
GRAYSON 
Give my regards to your managing editor. 
BINGY 
I certainly will. 
They stop at the door. Bingy extends a handshake, which is again refused. He stops and looks back at the jury. 
30. MEDIUM SHOT FROM HIS ANGLE 
The Schuylers all sitting silently and contemplating him. 
BINGY 
Well, so long folks! 
He flutters his eyes at Anne. 
BINGY 
Thanks! 
He takes one last look at Mrs. Schuyler and is again gripped by a violent sneeze. 
MRS. SCHUYLER 
(rising to the occasion) 
Uh, bless you! 
ALL 
Bless you! 
BINGY 
Thanks. 
The butler appears in the doorway behind him. Bingy exits past him, beaming. 
BINGY 
(waving to butler) 
So long! 
Grayson nods to the butler. 
GRAYSON 
Smythe, bring in the other reporter. 
SMYTHE 
Yes, sir. 
31. INT. SCHUYLER DRAWING ROOM - MEDIUM FULL SHOT 
The group awaiting the advent of the Post reporter. Stew is shown in by the butler, still carrying the Conrad book in his hand. They give him the once-over. Mrs. Schuyler raises her lorgnette with a magnificent gesture. Stew eyes them with animation, not in the slightest discouraged by this supercilious scrutiny. He starts toward them. 
32. MEDIUM SHOT 
As Stew approaches them. 
STEW 
Schuyler's the name, I presume? Yes, thank you, thank you. My name's Smith - Stewart Smith. No relation to John, Joe, Trade or Mark. Of course you can't have everything. 
He smiles engagingly on them. Stew addresses Mrs. Schuyler ingratiatingly, disregarding her expression of obvious distaste. 
STEW 
Nice set of Conrads you have out there, Mrs. Schuyler. I was just glancing through this one. 
(indicates the book in his hand) 
What's Michael tearing the paper about? 
GRAYSON 
Just a habit. Mr. Schuyler is a bit put out by all the rumors going around. 
33. CLOSER SHOT - STEW AND GRAYSON 
STEW 
Rumors? Rumors? Since when is a breach-of-promise case a rumor? 
GRAYSON 
No breach-of-promise case has been filed. The matter has been settled out of court. 
STEW 
(very cagey) 
Oh I see, but Gloria doesn't seem to be satisfied with the twenty thousand dollars. 
34. A MEDIUM SHOT OF GROUP 
At this, Mrs. Schuyler rises wrathfully. 
MRS. SCHUYLER 
(furiously to Grayson) 
Dexter Grayson, you told me it was only ten thousandand you didn't even get those letters from that Jezebel! 
Because my name's Schuyler too. And I haven't done a thing, but I'll suffer with Michael. And so will Mother. 
40. CLOSEUP - STEW 
He has been listening to this and enjoying it immensely. He looks over at Mrs. Schuyler. 
41. REVERSE ANGLE ON MRS. SCHUYLER 
Who is making a show of holding back a flood of tears. 
CONTINUATION SCENE 40 
STEW 
Mother's suffering already! 
CONTINUATION SCENE 39 
Anne, not wanting to lose her point, looks up at Stew pleadingly. 
ANNE 
As a special favor to me, you won't print that story, will you? 
CONTINUATION SCENE 40 
Stew, looking down at her in frank approval and admiration. 
ANNE 
(pleading) 
Please 
Stew hesitates still. 
42. MEDIUM SHOT 
Mrs. Schuyler, Michael, and Grayson. All watching the couple intently, hanging on the next wordswondering if Anne is going to succeed. They are tense and expectant. 
43. CLOSE SHOT - ANNE AND STEW 
He is looking down into her soft, melting eyes. Then he smiles. 
STEW 
You know something, lady, if you sold life insurance, I'd go for a policy in sixty seconds. 
ANNE 
Oh, thank you, I knew you'd understand. 
CONTINUATION SCENE 42 
The three. They relax and exchange relieved and triumphant glances. Apparently Anne has won. 
44. MEDIUM SHOT - ENTIRE GROUP 
Stew turns aside. 
STEW 
May I use your telephone? 
ANNE 
(eagerly) 
Certainly. Right over there. 
STEW 
You're all right. 
She indicates. Stew starts for the telephone. Anne walks to her mother's side. Stew gets to the telephone and picks up the receiver. 
STEW 
Hello, Beekman 1300? 
(he turns to wink at the group) 
That's an unlucky number. You know that, don't you? 
45. CLOSE SHOT - STEW 
At the telephone. He turns back to the instrument as he gets his connection. 
STEW 
(into phone) 
Hello, Toots? Is Conroy there? Give me Conroy. 
(pause) 
He isn't? Try the washroom, will you? 
While he waits for the connection, he turns and addresses the group expansively. 
STEW 
Say, I interviewed a swell guy the other day - Einstein. Swell guy, a little eccentric, but swell. Doesn't wear any garters. Neither do I as a matter of fact. What good are garters anyway? 
(he turns back to the phone) 
Hello, Conroy? This is Smith talking. I'm up at the Schuylers. No, I'm not having tea - that is, not yet. 
(again, he winks expansively at the groupthen returns to Conroy) 
Is she beautiful? Oh boss, her pictures don't do her justice. If I was that guy Ziegfield - what? 
46. CLOSE SHOT - ANNE AND MRS. SCHUYLER 
Anne smiles in spite of herself at this flattery. Stew's voice goes on. 
STEW'S VOICE 
Yes, it's easy to see where her beauty comes from. From her mother. 
For the first time, Mrs. Schuyler unbends to the extent of giving forth a smile. She cannot help but be pleased at this compliment. The atmosphere is now very friendly. Everybody feels that everything is all right. 
CONTINUATION SCENE 45 
Stew at the phone 
STEW 
Now wait a minute. Just hold on. Keep your shirt on. I'm coming to that. The Schuylers admit the story is true. Right. They gave the gal ten thousand bucks. But she's got some letters - and she's holding out for more dough - and it looks to me like she's going to get it. 
47. MEDIUM SHOT - SCHUYLER GROUP 
Horrified and shocked at this betrayal and double-crossing. 
STEW 
(on the phonebreezily) 
Right boss. I'll be right over. Right - no, I don't think I can get any pictures now. Right. 
He casually hangs up and turns from the phone. 
MRS. SCHUYLER 
(involuntary gasp) 
Oh-h-h . . .! 
Anne confronts him as if he were a reptile of the lowest order. 
ANNE 
(voice cold as ice) 
I've met some rotters in my time, but without a doubt, you're the lowest excuse for a man I've ever had the misfortune to meet 
Stew starts walking toward the door, still holding his book. The family is tremendously indignant and agitated. 
There you go, talking like a woman! 
GALLAGHER 
(a trifle resentfully) 
Well! 
STEW 
Well, you're my pal, aren't you? Then don't turn female on me. 
During these last few speeches, Gallagher has been regarding him with a curious expression. She loves being his pal, but wishes he would realize she is also a woman. 
53. MEDIUM SHOT 
Stew seems a little resentful of her attitude. He rises. 
STEW 
Pay that check, will you Gallagher? I'll give it back to you some time. Maybe. 
He flourishes the book of Conrad, which has been lying on the table in front of him, and makes a grand gesture. 
STEW 
I go now - I go with Conrad in quest of my youth! Fry those tomatoes, will you, Gallagher? 
He strikes a poseand exits. 
Gallagher, sits, looking after him, considerably disturbed. 
54. CLOSER SHOT - GALLAGHER 
Sitting, looking dismally after Stew. 
She opens her bag and takes out a mirror, surveying herself with frank disapproval. She pulls out a curl of hair before each ear, tries to soften the severe brim of the hat. She puts a finger to the tip of her nose and tilts it up, studying the effect. Then, with a sigh of disgust, she throws mirror and bag onto the table. 
LAP DISSOLVE TO: 
55. INT. SCHUYLER ENTRANCE HALL - DAY - LONG SHOT 
Smythe, the butler, previously introduced, comes from the direction of the rear of the house, and proceeds down the long, vast hallway towards the front door. The bell keeps ringing steadily. 
The butler reaches the wide front door. 
56. CLOSER SHOT 
As the butler opens the door and reveals Stew standing outside, hatless, a book in his hand, a spring overcoat slightly askew, the pockets bulging with contents. The butler quickly tries to slam the door in Stew's face, but Stew's right foot comes forward with a practiced newspaperman's gesture and he forces his way into the room. 
STEW 
(reproachfully) 
Now, now Jeeves.[5] Was that nice? Was that being a gentleman, Jeeves? Was it, Jeeves? Your name is Jeeves, isn't it? 
SMYTHE 
(stiffly) 
The name is Smythe. 
STEW 
Smythe! Well, well, well! With a Y , huh? 
(wags his head) 
Congratulations! What a small world. Brothers under livery. Shake! 
(he grabs the butler's hand) 
Now, as a Smith to a Smythe 
SMYTHE 
(glacially) 
Mrs. Schuyler is not at home. 
57. TWO SHOT - ANOTHER ANGLE 
STEW 
I know, I know. I waited outside till she went out. She's a very nice lady, but we don't vibrate well together. 
58. MEDIUM SHOT 
Anne, dressed in smart sports clothes, starts to cross thru the hall. She stops as she sees the butler engaged in conversation with Stew. 
SMYTHE 
(hollowly) 
No one's at home, sir. 
Anne starts walking toward them. Stew spots her. 
STEW 
Now Jeeves, what would you call this - 'no one'? 
Anne comes up to them. 
59. CLOSER THREE SHOT 
Anne looks up and sees that the butler is frowning and uncomfortable and addresses him. 
ANNE 
What's wrong? 
SMYTHE 
Mrs. Schuyler left orders, Miss, that if this person came here again, I was to call the police. 
STEW 
That's a good idea - telephone the police. The number is Spring 3100. Get a couple of cops over and we can have a rubber of bridge. 
ANNE 
You may go, Smythe. 
SMYTHE 
But I 
STEW 
Now the lady said you may go 
The butler bows stiffly and exits. 
ANNE 
(to Stewdirectly) 
What do you want? 
STEW 
Well, I tell you, yesterday when I was here, I had one of your books in my hand, and when I got outside, I realized I still had your book in my hand. So as long as I had your book in my hand, I thought I might as well take it home and read it. This morning, I got up and put your book in my hand, and here's your book in your hand. 
He extends the Conrad book, and Anne, making no effort to take it, he throws it on the table. 
ANNE 
(haughty) 
That's considerate of you. 
STEW 
Yeah, that was considerate of me. I recommend you read it. 
60. CLOSER TWO SHOT 
GRAYSON 
When you get through with him? 
76. DOUBLE SHOT 
ANNE 
Yes, it'll be a very interesting experiment. 
GRAYSON 
(sneering) 
To make a gentleman out of a tramp? 
ANNE 
Exactly. 
GRAYSON 
Now, Anne, you remember how much it cost to get rid of that baseball player? 
ANNE 
You don't seem to understand that this one's different. He has brains. 
77. MED. CLOSE SHOT 
Grayson seats himself beside her on the divan. 
GRAYSON 
(fervently) 
But what about me, Anne? 
She looks at him coldly with almost an expression of dislike. 
ANNE 
You? Oh, don't go serious on me, Dexter. 
LAP DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. PENTHOUSE APT. - NIGHT 
78. MED. SHOT TRUCKING 
An elaborate, modernistic roof apartment, thronged with people all in evening dress. Stew and Anne are walking down among them. Anne is radiant, and Stew is happily guiding her among the stuffed shirts. Anne stops before a group. There is the sound of conversation, laughter, clink of glasses, music from stringed invisible orchestra, etc. 
ANNE 
Hello, Natalie. Mr. Stewart Smith . . . Miss Montgomery, Mrs. Eames, Mrs. Radcliff, Mr. Radcliff 
STEW 
How-di-do. 
GROUP 
(ad-lib acknowledgements) 
79. MED. CLOSE SHOT - DEXTER GRAYSON 
Standing, helping himself to a cocktail, which a footman is passing about. Dexter looks off with a frown of disapproval. 
80. CLOSE SHOT - GROUP OF WOMEN 
They are looking off in Anne's direction. 
FIRST WOMAN 
Say, who's Anne's new boyfriend? 
SECOND WOMAN 
Well, if these old ears don't deceive me, I believe his name is Smith. 
FIRST WOMAN 
Smith! Can't be one of the brothers - he hasn't a beard on.[6] 
SECOND WOMAN 
Well, he must have something if Anne has got her clutches on him. 
There is the sound of a piano chord being struck. 
81. MED. FULL SHOT 
Mrs. Baxter, the hostess, is standing importantly by the grand piano at which is seated an anaemic-looking young man. Beside her stands a stout, swarthy Italian with bristling mustachios. Mrs. Baxter bows toward the swarthy one, who bends almost double in acknowledgement. There is a polite scattering of applause, and some of the guests seat themselves. 
Martini starts to sing. 
Unnoticed by the rest, Stew and Anne slip out of the door into the roof garden. 
EXT. ROOF GARDEN 
82. MED. FULL SHOT 
A most beautiful, romantic spot. Rose trees in blossom, a vine-covered pergola, a splashing fountain, a few choice marble statues, low, deep chairs placed to make a gorgeous spot. Stew and Anne enter from the direction of the house. The garden is dark except for the lights from the interior of the house. From within, comes the voice of the singer rendering an extremely romantic, sentimental Italian love song. This will continue to the FADE OUT of the scene. 
Stew and Anne walk, still hand in hand, toward the edge of the pergola where the shadows are deeper and where a couple of glorified steamer chairs are placed. There is a full moon overhead. 
She leads him toward a waterfall effect, a glass partition down which water trickles. They go behind the dimly lit fountain and sit 
in a low, deep divan. We see them in silhouette as they go into a passionate embrace. All we hear is the faint voice of Martiniand the uninterrupted splashing of the fountain. 
CUT TO: 
83. CLOSEUP - ANNE & STEW 
On divan, arms around each other. 
STEW 
Anne, pinch me, will you? Throw me out of here. Give me the air. Throw me out of this joint, will you? 
Anne smiles happily and pinches his nose. 
ANNE 
Why should I? We're happy, aren't we, darling? 
STEW 
Throw me out - because I'm beginning to get goofy ideas, and they concern you, Anne. 
ANNE 
(passionately) 
None of your ideas can be goofy, Stew, if they concern me. 
STEW 
(struggling) 
My name is Smith - well, that you seem to have been able to stand for the last month. I'm white, male and over twenty-one. I've never been in jail - that is, not often. And I prefer Scotch to Bourbon. I hate carrots, I hate peas, I like black coffee and I hate garters. I make seventy-five bucks a week and I've got eight hundred and forty-seven bucks in the bank - and - I don't know yet whether your eyes are blue or violet. 
ANNE 
(although he is very close to her) 
That's because you're too far away, Stew. 
Throughout his speech, Anne never takes her eyes off him. As he fumbles now, he turns. Their eyes meet. His overwhelming desire for Anne overcomes him. 
He dismisses as futile his effort to be practical, sweeps her into his arms and kisses her passionately. 
FADE OUT: 
FADE IN 
INT. CITY ROOM OF MORNING POST - DAY 
CONROY 
Is that so? 
STEW 
That's so. 
109. CLOSEUP - CONROY 
He shows that he is genuinely interested in Stew and his problems, but can't help being a little sarcastic. 
CONROY 
Anne Schuyler's in the Blue Book - you're not even in the phone book. Think that one over, sucker. 
CAMERA PANS to CLOSEUP of GALLAGHER. 
GALLAGHER 
(quickly in Stew's defense) 
That doesn't make any difference 
(quietly) 
if they love each other. 
CAMERA PANS BACK to CLOSEUP of CONROY. 
CONROY 
Blah! It's like a giraffe marrying a monkey. 
(looking off at Stew) 
Listen - you'll never be anything but just the reporter that married the Schuyler's millions. Stew Smith is dead and buried. From now on, you'll be just Anne Schuyler's husband. A rich 
wife's magnolia. If you can smoke that without getting sick, you're welcome to it. 
CAMERA PANS to CLOSEUP of STEW: 
GALLAGHER'S VOICE 
But that's perfectly ridiculous. 
STEW 
(defensively) 
Wait a minute. Now, Gallagher, let me do the talking. Get this, Conroy - Anne Schuyler has got a lot of dough, all right - and I married her, all right - but her dough and me? No connection. 
110. MED. CLOSE THREE SHOT 
Gallagher is looking fixedly at Stew - very much worried about Conroy's dismal prophecies. Conroy shakes his head in sorrowful gloom. 
CONROY 
(as if he had not heard Stew) 
Just a boid in a gilded cage -[10] 
STEW 
A what? 
CONROY 
You heard me. A bird in a gilded cage. 
STEW 
Aw, you've been reading a lot of cheap tabloids. Anne and myself are going to move downtown in a nice little flat, we're gonna forget all about this social stuff, and we're gonna be known as Mr. and Mrs. Stew Smith. How do you like that? 
CONROY 
(sarcasm) 
And live on your salary, I suppose? 
STEW 
Yeah, live on my salary - that is, until I finish writing my play. 
CONROY 
(snorts) 
What play? 
STEW 
My play. 
CONROY 
The one about the Siberian bloodhound? 
STEW 
Siberian bloodhound? No. That's been all rewritten. It's laid in Araby now. 
CONROY 
Araby? 
STEW 
Sure. 
CONROY 
Araby, my eye! 
111. WIDER SHOT 
Conroy, having finished his drink, pushes back his chair and rises. He puts an affectionate hand on Stew's shoulder. 
CONROY 
Well, I'm sorry to see a good reporter go blooey 
(starts away) 
Let me know when you're quitting. 
STEW 
I'm not quitting! 
CONROY 
No? 
STEW 
No! 
CONROY 
(singing) 
'For he's only a bird in a gilded cage, a beautiful sight to see' 
(he waves his hand) 
Tweet, tweet - ha, ha 
He laughs loud and raucously and exits. 
112. CLOSE SHOT - STEW AND GALLAGHER 
Stew glares after Conroy. 
STEW 
(under his breath) 
Mrs. Schuyler! 
Grayson does not acknowledge the greeting. Mrs. Schuyler, having drained the glass, dismisses the butler with a wave of the hand, and directs her attention again to the matter at hand. 
MRS. SCHUYLER 
(in command) 
Well, what's to be done? He's here now. 
They are all silent - reluctant to speak in front of Stew. Stew looks at them all - a little puzzled - then he walks over toward Mrs. Schuyler. 
117. MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT 
Mrs. Schuyler and Stew. 
STEW 
Nobody seems to want to do anything 
(to Mrs. Schuyler, brightly) 
Why not ask me? Perhaps I can offer a suggestion. Do what about what? 
MRS. SCHUYLER 
(witheringly) 
About what? Your marriage to Anne! 
STEW 
(with a tone of dismissal) 
Oh, my marriage to Anne. Now Mrs. Schuyler, we don't want you to go to any trouble about that. We just want the usual blessings, that's all. 
118. MEDIUM SHOT 
Mrs. Schuyler's eyes flash. She draws herself up with haughty dignity. 
MRS. SCHUYLER 
Young man, I want you to know that I object violently to this whole affair! 
This finally brings Anne out of her seat. She rises and crosses to Stew, making a show of embracing him. 
ANNE 
Now Mother, your attitude is perfectly ridiculous. It's done now. Stewart and I are married. 
STEW 
(to Mrs. Schuyler) 
I'm afraid she's right, Mrs. Schuyler. I'm really very sorry, Mrs. Schuyler, that you feel this way. I was in hopes that you would like me. I'm not the burglar that you think I am. After all, we're married. I think the thing to do is to kiss and make up - Mother. 
MRS. SCHUYLER 
(furiously) 
Stop calling me Mother! 
STEW 
(easily) 
All right, Grandma 
MRS. SCHUYLER 
(glaring) 
This man's impossible! I can't talk to him. Grayson, let's go where we can talk - hic! 
(she emits a burp, then fixes a glacial look at Anne) 
See what you've done to me!? 
Without another word, she turns and flounces angrily out of the room. Grayson follows her. At the doorway he pauses, starts to say something. They all look at him expectantly - but no words come out. 
STEW 
Got it too, huh? 
Grayson gives a harrumph and exits. 
119. CLOSER MEDIUM SHOT 
Anne, Michael and Stew. Michael grins at Stew. 
MICHAEL 
Who won that round? 
Michael starts moving toward the door. 
STEW 
(ruefully) 
I'm afraid your mother won that round - that is, she got in the last blow. 
MICHAEL 
I don't feel the way they do. You're really not as bad as everybody thinks. 
STEW 
(effusively - shaking his hand) 
You're beginning to appreciate me, eh? Thanks! 
MICHAEL 
Don't worry too much about Mother - she's enjoying this. Come on upstairs, I'll give you a little - 
He indicates a snifter, grins and exits. Anne crosses to Stew and puts her arm around his shoulder. 
STEW 
(to Michael) 
A little? Sure, I'll be right up. 
(to Anne) 
He's all right. I like him. 
ANNE 
I'm glad. 
He sees two figures pass above in a proscenium alcove, first Mrs. Schuyler, then Grayson. He makes an elaborate bow to each, and is impressed by Grayson's return bow. 
STEW 
He can bend! 
120. CLOSER SHOT 
Anne takes a step backwards and sits down with him on one of the divans. CAMERA TILTING DOWN WITH THEM. He puts an arm about her. 
ANNE 
Come here baby! 
Anne starts fussing abstractedly at Stew's tie. They kiss. 
ANNE 
I haven't seen you for three hours. You're neglecting me already 
During her speech she has been picking away at a stain on his tie. Stew looks down and notices it. 
STEW 
What's the matter? Something I et, no doubt. Egg marks the spot 
Mr. Smith, sir! 
Still no response. The valet taps the bedclothes-shrouded shoulder gently. 
DAWSON 
Mr. Smith, sir 
Sleepily, Stew turns, his eyes heavy with sleep. 
128. MEDIUM SHOT 
DAWSON 
How do you like your bath, sir? 
STEW 
I like my bath all right. How do you like your bath? 
Stew peers up, puzzled. 
STEW 
Who are you? 
DAWSON 
(surprised) 
I'm your valet, sir. Dawson is the name, sir. 
STEW 
You're my what? 
DAWSON 
Your valet, sir. 
Stew still stares at him. Then he nods to himself - thinks he gets the idea. Stew kicks back the covers and sits on the edge of the bed in his pajamas. Still sitting on the edge of the bed, he starts to slip his feet into a pair of slippers. The valet bends on one knee to help him. 
STEW 
Thank you, thank you, thank you! I'll do that for you some time. That's very sweet. Say listen, what did you say your name was? 
DAWSON 
Dawson, sir. 
STEW 
Dawson, huh? Was I very drunk last night? 
DAWSON 
Drunk, sir? 
Stew rises and starts to reach for a dressing gown, but again the valet beats him to it - holding it for him and helping him slip into it. 
STEW 
Yes. I must have been pretty much plastered if I hired a valet. 
DAWSON 
Oh, but you didn't engage me, sir. 
Stew, surprised, turns on him quickly. 
STEW 
Who did engage you then, if I didn't engage you? What are you doing with my pants 
The valet picks up his pants. 
STEW 
Did you take anything out of those pants? 
DAWSON 
Oh no, sir! 
STEW 
What are you doing fooling around in here? 
DAWSON 
Miss Schuyler - I mean, Mrs. Smith - she engaged me this morning, sir. 
Stew pulls out a cigarette. The valet, without missing a beat, leans over and offers a light. A wary Stew accepts. 
STEW 
Hmmm. So Mrs. Smith engaged me a valley, huh? That's very nice of Mrs. Smith - to engage me a valley. 
129. WIDER SHOT 
Stew walks over and gets a cigarette out of a box on a small table, waving his hand in a gesture of dismissal. The valet is right behind him, holding up his bathrobe for Stew to step into. 
STEW 
(putting on the bathrobe) 
Say, you are nice. You're all right. You'd make a good wife. 
DAWSON 
Thank you, sir. 
STEW 
But not for me! Though I like you well enough. You're a nice fellow. You're all right. But I'm sorry I don't need any valleys today. 
The valet pays no attention to him, but walks around the room, picking up the clothes that Stew has flung about. 
DAWSON 
Oh, but indeed you do, sir, if you don't mind my saying so. A gentleman's gentleman, as it were. Someone to draw your bath, lay out your clothes, help to dress you - it's really most essential, sir. 
Stew, with his cigarette between his lips, stands watching the valet as he retrieves the various articles of cast-off clothing. The valet's manner is somewhat patronizing. He walks over to a chifferobe and starts opening the drawers, preparatory to laying out fresh things for Stew. Suddenly, Stew stalks over to him, takes him by the shoulder, and yanks him around to face him. 
130. CLOSER SHOT - STEW AND DAWSON 
The valet is astonished and somewhat alarmed at the belligerent expression on Stew's face. 
STEW 
(over-sweetly) 
Are you trying to tell me that I need someone to help me put on my pants and button them up? 
DAWSON 
Quite so. Quite. 
STEW 
Now I'm sorry. I appreciate your efforts. But I don't need anybody to help me button my pants - I've been buttoning my pants for thirty years all right, and I can button 'em with one hand as a matter of fact. 
DAWSON 
Now Mr. Smith, now please 
Stew is rapidly losing his temper. 
STEW 
You've got a nice face, Dawson, you wouldn't want anything to happen to your face, would you? 
The valet puts a bewildered hand to his face. 
DAWSON 
Oh no, sir 
CAMERA TRUCKS with them as they weave in and out of crowd. Miss Wilson points out celebrated guests to her. 
MISS WILSON 
There's the Spanish Ambassador. 
Gallagher steals a glance at the celebrated gentleman. 
GALLAGHER 
You know, he looks like one. 
Miss Wilson laughs delightedly. At this point they are interrupted by a butler. 
149. MEDIUM SHOT 
BUTLER 
Miss Wilson 
MISS WILSON 
Yes? 
BUTLER 
Mrs. Smith would like to see you. 
MISS WILSON 
(to Gallagher) 
Will you excuse me? Make yourself at home for just a moment, please. 
GALLAGHER 
Thanks. 
Miss Wilson follows butler out of scene. Gallagher is left alone. She wanders about the huge ballroom, peering here and there, searching for Stew. Finally she comes to a large open French door and steps out. 
150. INT. TERRACE LEADING OFF SCHUYLER BALLROOM 
Several groups of men and women are seated at tables. Gallagher enters from ballroom, glances quickly at all the men. Disappointed at not finding Stew, she crosses terrace and descends broad stone steps and advances into garden. 
151. INT. SECLUDED SPOT IN GARDEN 
Stew, his head cupped in his hands, is seated on a stone bench. Gallagher wanders into scene. She sees Stew and stops. Stew does not move. Gallagher, with a happy smile on her lips, moves closer to him. Stew suddenly becomes conscious of someone near him and looks suddenly up. He sees Gallagher; his face breaks into a happy grin. 
GALLAGHER 
Mr. Smith, I've read some of your plays and I'd like an autograph. 
STEW 
Well, well! If it isn't my old friend! Turn around, gal! Let's get a look at you. 
GALLAGHER 
There you are! 
152. CLOSER SHOT OF THE TWO 
STEW 
Well, daughter of the slums - how did you get out of the ghetto? 
GALLAGHER 
I'm pinch-hitting for our society editor tonight. I wanted to see some life in the raw. 
STEW 
Aw, you wanted to see some life in the raw, huh? Well gal, I'm afraid we ain't got no raw life up here. 
GALLAGHER 
Well, I'll have to look someplace else. 
STEW 
No, no! Maybe we could interest you in some well done butterflies, or perhaps some slightly fried pansies, or better still, some stuffed shirts. And guaranteed every one of them will give you a good stiff pain in the neck. 
GALLAGHER 
(fixing his tie) 
Say, who's been tying your ties lately? It looks rotten. 
He suddenly realizes there's something different about Gallagher. He takes a step back so as to look her over carefully - blinks his eyes. 
STEW 
Gee Gallagher, do you look good! What are you doing to yourself? 
GALLAGHER 
Nothing. 
STEW 
What did you do to that hair? And where did you get that dress? 
GALLAGHER 
I dyed one and washed the other. 
STEW 
(enthusiastically) 
Oh, you dyed one and washed the other. Well! You certainly look good. 
153. ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDEN 
Anne is walking in direction of Stew and Gallagher. She stops suddenly when she sees them. Her body stiffens. 
CUT BACK TO: 
ANOTHER SHOT - STEW AND GALLAGHER 
From Anne's angle. Gallagher is facing in the direction of Anne. 
GALLAGHER 
Don't turn around now - but there's a very beautiful girl up there who seems to be staring at us. 
STEW 
Staring at us? 
GALLAGHER 
My mistake - she's glaring. 
STEW 
Must be my wife. 
He turns - sees Anne. 
STEW 
It is my wife. Hi Anne. Don't go away. Stay right there, because I'm going to bring a friend up I want you to meet. 
They exit. 
154. MED. CLOSE SHOT - ANNE 
Standing as before. She is looking off with slightly narrowed eyes. Stew and Gallagher come up to her. 
STEW 
Anne, prepare yourself for the treat of your life. This is Gallagher. 
ANNE 
(astounded) 
GALLAGHER 
(reassuringly) 
Oh, that's all right, Stew. Forget it. As far as she's concerned, I'm just part of the hired help. 
STEW 
No, no. Strange, I've never seen Anne act that way before. (pause) It's funny I never thought to tell her you were a girl, isn't it? 
GALLAGHER 
Yes. 
INT. SCHUYLER ENTRANCE HALL 
160. MED. CLOSE SHOT 
The butler is just opening the door. Bingy, looking more disreputable than usual, steps inside. 
BINGY 
Hello, there, Meadows![13] 
SMYTHE 
(disapproving once-over) 
Who is it you wish to see, sir? 
BINGY 
I want to see Stew Smith. Oh excuse me - I mean Mr. Smith. 
SMYTHE 
Pardon me, Mr. Smith is engaged. We are having a reception here this evening 
BINGY 
Oh, a party! Great, great! Jolly times and merry pranks. That's me. I'm a guy who loves parties. You know 
He is distracted by two elegantly-dressed ladies strolling by. 
BINGY 
a beautiful pair of shoulders! But listen now, as a favor, will you please make it snappy, Laughing Waters,[14] and tell Stew Smith I gotta see him because if you don't my whole family's going to die. 
SMYTHE 
I'll tell Mr. Smith at once, sir. Have a seat. 
BINGY 
Well, I got a seat, but I have no place to put it. 
The butler turns to leave, then turns back, his face expressing distinct disapproval. 
SMYTHE 
Pardon me, sir, but I've heard that one before. 
INT. SCHUYLER BALLROOM 
161. CLOSE SHOT 
Stew and Gallagher standing together. The butler is seen leaving the scene, having just informed Stew of Bingy's presence at the reception. 
STEW 
(to Gallagher) 
Excuse me. I just want to make sure and see he doesn't take away any of the vases. 
(starts to leave, then turns back) 
Well, well, well! My little pal, Gallagher, a girl, huh? 
(unexpectedly, he bends to kiss her hand) 
(tenderly) 
That's just to give you an idea that I know how to treat a gal. Get fresh with me and I'll sock you in that little nose of yours. Excuse me. I'll be right back. 
He exits. Gallagher is left staring at her hand wonderingly. 
INT. SCHUYLER ENTRANCE HALL 
162. MED. SHOT 
Bingy gets up from his throne chair, and crosses into the doorway of the library opposite him. He stops by a carved low-boy, and curiously examines a large antique vase. Stew comes in and stops with a smile as he sees him. 
Bingy, his hand on the vase, looks up. Stew walks over to him. 
STEW 
(referring to vase) 
What's the matter, Bingy, a little clumsy to get in your pocket? 
Bingy sets down the vase and surveys him. 
BINGY 
No. I was just looking at it. Pretty, ain't it? I was just looking for the price tag. 
INT. SCHUYLER LIBRARY 
163. CLOSER SHOT OF THE TWO 
Bingy looks him up and down in silent, insolent scrutiny. Stew begins to burn. 
STEW 
What do you want? 
BINGY 
Oh, nothing. I just blew over - I wanted to see how the old newshound looked made up for a gentleman. 
STEW 
(sore) 
Would you like to have me turn around for you, Bingy? 
BINGY 
Oh boy, I'd love it. 
Stew makes a complete turn and faces Bingy again. 
STEW 
How's that? 
BINGY 
(appraisingly) 
Not bad - not good - but not bad. You ought to be able to fool about almost anybody. 
STEW 
Is that so? Well, have you seen enough - or would you like a photograph? 
BINGY 
A photograph? What's the matter? Hasn't mama had you done in oils yet? 
(singing) 
"Just A Gigolo . . . "[15] 
STEW 
Now get this mug. You've got the kind of chin I just love to touch. And if you don't get out of here, I'm going to hang one right on it. 
She is interrupted by the entrance of Grayson, who dashes into the room, his eyes ablaze. In his hand he has a copy of the morning paper. 
GRAYSON 
(tapping paper in hand) 
Did you see the papers? "Cinderella Man Grows Hair On Chest!" This is the most terrible kind of publicity that could possibly 
MRS. SCHUYLER 
(interrupting) 
Don't you think I know it, Grayson? 
(as Smythe the butler enters with tray) 
Smith - send for Mr. Smythe! Er - Smythe, send for Mr. Smith! 
SMYTHE 
(as he turns to go) 
Double-strength! 
MRS. SCHUYLER 
(muttering, as she exits scene) 
"Cinderella Man Grows Hair On Chest!" 
GRAYSON 
(close behind, contemptuously) 
"I wear the pants," says Anne Schuyler's husband! 
INT. SCHUYLER ENTRANCE HALL - DAY 
169. MEDIUM SHOT 
Stew, now dressed in a business suit, comes from the direction of the stairs and stops just before he gets to the door of the drawing room. From within there is an ominous silence. Stew looks longingly in the direction of the front door - then back at the drawing room, squares his shoulders and goes in. 
INT. SCHUYLER DRAWING ROOM 
170. CLOSE SHOT 
As Stew stops just inside the doorway. He had been prepared for this, but it strikes terror into his soul, just the same. 
171. MEDIUM FULL SHOT 
From his angle in the doorway. The jury - Dexter Grayson, hands behind his back - is standing, gazing at Stew with a fishy eye. Mrs. Schuyler stares haughtily. Anne is crying softly. 
CONTINUATION SCENE 170 
Stew - looking around at the gallery of faces. Then he forces a jaunty smile to his face as he starts to enter, whistling as he goes. 
STEW 
Good morning, everybody 
(he gets a cold, frigid, silent reception) 
Well, maybe it isn't a good morning, huh? 
(to Anne) 
Anne, did you ever get the feeling that there was someone else in the room with you? 
172. MEDIUM SHOT 
MRS. SCHUYLER 
Have you seen this? 
(shows him newspaper) 
STEW 
Yes - the worm! 
MRS. SCHUYLER 
I beg your pardon? 
STEW 
He's a worm - and I'm gonna step on him! 
MRS. SCHUYLER 
To engage in a brawl! A cheap, common brawl, in my own home! "I wear the pants!" The pants ! Not even the trousers! 
GRAYSON 
I've tried to stop the evening papers, but it's useless. 
173. CLOSER SHOT - STEW AND GRAYSON 
STEW 
You quit trying to stop anybody 
GRAYSON 
Well, at best you might deny it. 
STEW 
Why deny it? The more you deny, the more they print. Let them alone! The thing to do is to sit still and keep our traps shut. 
GRAYSON 
Traps shut! 
STEW 
Certainly! I'll take care of this guy Bingy myself, personally. 
(sees Anne crying) 
Now what are you crying about? 
174. MEDIUM SHOT 
ANNE 
Is this true, Stewart? Did you really say it? 
STEW 
Yes, I said it. Sure, I said it. I didn't say it for publication, however. 
MRS. SCHUYLER 
And you struck him right here in our house? 
STEW 
Yes, I'm sorry, I struck him right here in your house. And I'll strike anybody in anybody's house that calls me a Cinderella Man. 
GRAYSON 
Well, what else do you expect them to call you? 
ANNE 
Dexter. 
175. CLOSEUP - STEW 
STEW 
(burning) 
That's the fourteenth crack you've made to me. I'm keeping count. When you get to twenty, I'm gonna sock you right on the nose. As a matter of fact, I ought to sock you right now. 
176. MEDIUM FULL SHOT 
STEW 
Yes, I'll tell you - for the same reason I've never wanted to go out with those social parasites, those sweet-smelling fashion plates. I don't like them. They bore me. They give me the jitters. 
ANNE'S VOICE 
Do you know you're talking about my friends? 
STEW 
Yes, I'm talking about your friends, and they still give me the jitters. 
183. DOUBLE SHOT 
ANNE 
Well, are you going - or aren't you? 
Stew makes a move to embrace her. 
STEW 
Anne, come here. Listen 
ANNE 
(sternly - slipping away from him) 
Look out for my lipstick, Stewart. 
STEW 
I'll tell you what. Let's you and me sneak out all by ourselves 
ANNE 
(interrupting) 
Are you crazy? 
STEW 
Think of the fun we can have - we'll sneak down the back stairs and get in the valet's Ford. How's that? 
ANNE 
Will you stop being silly, Stewart? 
STEW 
(trying hard) 
I'll tell you what let's do - I'll take you and introduce you to all my gang. Would you like that? 
ANNE 
(hard) 
But I don't want to meet your gang. 
STEW 
I don't mean the newspaper fellows that you don't like. Another gang I know - you'd love them. They're writers and musicians and artists - a great crowd of people - people who do great things. People who are worthwhile. 
ANNE 
Meaning, my friends aren't worthwhile, I suppose? 
STEW 
Oh, they're all right, Anne. But I 
ANNE 
(interrupting belligerently) 
That's exactly what you mean. Heaven knows you've made that clear to me often enough. Well, I'm sick and tired of it. I've given you party after party - I've taken you to some of the best houses in this town - and introduced you to people of importance - and are you grateful? No! You insult them and act like a bore. I'm sick and tired of having to make excuses for you and the things that you've done. Perhaps it's just as well you're not coming tonight. Maybe I can enjoy myself for once without having to worry about you, and what you're going to do. 
With which violent declaration, she flounces out of the room, leaving Stew staring after her, angry and hurt. Impulsively, he follows her to the door - a retort on his lips. When he gets there, however, she has vanished. He returns to the room, wanders about thoughtfully, extracts cigarette from box, fumbles it - walks to window - stares out - turns back to room - heaves a lonely sigh. 
He notices his reflection in the mirror, and gestures toward it. 
STEW 
And that, my friends, is what is known as the society belle telling ex-star-newspaper-reporter to go to - how-have-you-been, Mr. Smith! 
184. CLOSE SHOT 
As Stew sits in a typewriter chair. He rolls up the sheet in the machine so that he can read what is already written. 
INSERT: TYPEWRITTEN SHEET, IN TYPEWRITER 
ACT 1 
SCENE 1 
AN HACIENDA IN MEXICO 
Strumming of guitars are dimly heard. 
BACK TO SCENE: 
He studies it for a moment, frowning in dissatisfaction. He's stuck. He leans back in the chair and looks up for inspiration. 
INSERT: A BIG CLOCK, TICKING AWAY THE TIME. 
INT. SCHUYLER GRAND FOYER 
185. LONG SHOT 
Of Stew Smith pacing the grand foyer. Seen from overhead, he is dwarfed by the surroundings. He tries hopscotching on the pattern of the floor. That wears thin quickly. Supremely bored, Stew gives a shout and is rewarded with a cavernous echo. Smythe the butler then appears, nervously crouched behind some grillwork. 
186. MEDIUM SHOT - STEW AND SMYTHE 
SMYTHE 
Did you call, sir? 
STEW 
Smythe, come here. I want to talk to you. 
(Smythe looks unenthusiastic.) 
Come on, Smythe, talk to me. Smythe, I'm going nuts. I'm going nuts in this house! This big . . . come on, I'm not going to hurt you. Come on, what's the matter with you? 
Stew gives another shout and is rewarded with another loud echo. This coaxes Smythe out from behind the grillwork. 
STEW 
Shhh! Do you hear something? 
SMYTHE 
Yes, sir. 
STEW 
You try it. 
SMYTHE 
(reluctant) 
Me, sir? 
STEW 
Yeah. 
Smythe gives it a timid try. 
STEW 
No, no. Give it more volume. 
Smythe gives a more satisfactory yell. Stew nods approval. Smythe begins yelling and shouting in earnest. 
Gallagher at phone. 
GALLAGHER 
Oh, your play. Hmmm, Act One, Scene One: Coast of Norway - and then a lot of blank. Is that it? 
CONTINUATION SCENE 187 
Stew at phone. 
STEW 
Yeah. Come on, don't be silly. 
(pause) 
All right, if you feel like you need a chaper-one, call up Hank. Yeah. You'll find him at Joe's, no doubt. Yeah. Hank would be my idea of a perfect bodyguard. 
(pause) 
Sure you would. I knew I could depend on you, old pal. Snap it up, will you, Gallagher? 
CONTINUATION SCENE 188 
Gallagher at phone. 
GALLAGHER 
Okay. 
She hangs up, joyful at the prospect of seeing Stew. She hums softly to herself as she picks up the receiver again. 
INT. SCHUYLER ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT 
189. MED. SHOT 
SOUND 
(bell ringing) 
Stew comes out of the library. Smythe is going down the hall. Stew intercepts him. 
STEW 
Smythe, I'll get this. I'm expecting some friends. 
SMYTHE 
Very good, sir. 
190. MED. CLOSE SHOT 
At entrance door. Stew enters and opens it. Gallagher and Hank enter. 
STEW 
Well, Gallagher! Glad to see you. 
GALLAGHER 
Hello, Stew. 
STEW 
Hello, Hank. How are you? 
HANK 
Fine, but kinda thirsty. 
STEW 
Come right in - I'll get you a drink. 
HANK 
Okay - you remember Joe 
STEW 
Sure. 
HANK 
I sort of invited him along to bend an elbow. You don't mind, do you? 
STEW 
It's all right. Bring him in. 
Joe appears in the open doorway. Stew sees him. 
HANK 
Come in, Joe. It's all right. 
STEW 
Hello, Joe. 
JOE 
Hello kid, how are you? Glad to see you. 
Stew starts to close the door. 
JOE 
Just a minute - Johnson's outside. You don't mind if he comes in and dips a beak[17] do you? 
STEW 
No, no, bring him in. The more the merrier. 
JOE 
Come on in! 
Johnson appears in the open doorway. Stew sees him. 
STEW 
Hello, Johnson. 
JOHNSON 
Hello, Stew, old pal. How are you? 
STEW 
Glad to see you. Come in, kid. 
Stew starts to close the door. 
JOHNSON 
Wait a minute. I got two of the boys I brought along - they were cruising around with nothing to do. You don't mind if I bring them in? 
STEW 
You brought two of the boys? That's all right. Bring them in. What's the difference? 
The two enter, followed in a single file by 12-14 men and women, all of whom greet Stew as they enter, ad-libbing hello's and hand-shakes. Stew stares at them dumbfoundedly. 
191. MEDIUM FULL SHOT 
They swarm into the hallway and overflow into the rooms on either side. The butler stands aghast at this invasion. Stew starts to close the door when three or four more troop in, shouting cheery greetings. Stew regards them in amazement. 
192. CLOSER SHOT - STEW 
As he watches them file past. 
STEW 
I'm sorry nobody could come. 
HANK 
She turns as Stew walks over to her. 
GALLAGHER 
(smiling) 
Well, you're not getting your play done, but you're certainly covering a lot of territory. 
STEW 
(grins) 
Haven't I covered some territory? It feels like I've been on a Cook's Tour[18] some place. 
197. CLOSER TWO SHOT 
Stew, standing before her. 
GALLAGHER 
(seriously) 
Stewart, have you ever been to Old Madrid? 
STEW 
(grinning in spite of himself) 
Been where? 
Gallagher 
To Old Madrid. 
STEW 
Never even been to New Madrid. 
GALLAGHER 
Then how do you expect to write about it? 
STEW 
Oh - draw on my imagination, I suppose. 
GALLAGHER 
Did Conrad draw on his imagination? 
Stew is brought up with a start. 
STEW 
Did who? 
GALLAGHER 
Conrad. 
STEW 
What do you know about Conrad? 
GALLAGHER 
I don't know a thing about him, but isn't he the one you're always yelling about? 
Stew is noticeably impressed with this point of view. 
STEW 
Gosh, you look cute. 
Gallagher warms up to her subject. 
GALLAGHER 
Isn't he the one that always writes about things - only the things he knows about? 
STEW 
Right. 
GALLAGHER 
Didn't he go to sea before he wrote about it? 
STEW 
Right. 
198. MEDIUM SHOT 
GALLAGHER 
Then why don't you write about something you know? Write about yourself and Anne. The poor boy who marries a rich girl - now there's a swell theme. 
STEW 
Gee, that's an idea, Gallagher. That's an idea there. I wonder now . . . 
GALLAGHER 
Oh, sure. She'd make a beautiful heroine 
STEW 
(warming up - he puts arm around Gallagher's shoulder) 
And there's her mother - and what a character that old dame would make with her double-strength - and that lawyer friend of theirs - he'd make a great villain - and there's you! 
GALLAGHER 
(smiling) 
What could I be? 
STEW 
You could be something. 
(inspiration striking, he dashes to the typewriter) 
I've got an idea, Gallagher. Let's get this set. That's a great idea for a play. Pal, get me a cigarette, will you? 
GALLAGHER 
Here you are. 
STEW 
All right, thanks. Now, let's see. How will I start? Hey pal, how would you start? 
LAP DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. SCHUYLER ENTRANCE HALL 
199. MED. FULL SHOT 
Shooting through into the drawing room. It is many hours later. The members of the party, including Smythe, are pretty well lit. On the floor of the entrance hall a dice game is in progress. In the drawing room four or five are hanging over the piano singing "The Grasshopper Jumped Over Another Grasshopper's Back." 
In general, a large time is being had. As the scene opens a door-bell is ringing. A key is heard in the lock. 
200. CLOSER SHOT - GROUP - IN ENTRANCE HALL 
The outer door starts to swing open. One of the party guests, very wall-eyed now, and carrying a whiskey bottle in his hand, staggers toward the door. It opens wider, and Anne and Mrs. Schuyler and Dexter Grayson stand gasping in the opening. The guest comes up to them. 
GUEST 
(starting to close door) 
Say, you can't come in here - this is a private party. 
Anne pushes the door violently, which sends the guest sprawling. He stays where he lands, holding the bottle in both arms across his chest. Anne and her mother advance into a CLOSE SHOT and look off with incredulous horror and amazement. 
201. MEDIUM SHOT 
STEW 
Have we got a play, Anne? Oh, have we got a play! Of course most of it is Gallagher's. She did most of it. That brain of hers just snaps like that all the time. 
He indicates by snapping his fingers. Gallagher quietly gathers up her things, apprehensive of the storm about to break. 
ANNE 
(coldly) 
I'm not interested in the way her brain snaps. 
Stew stares at Anne as Gallagher, her hat in her hand, her coat over her arm, starts for the door. 
GALLAGHER 
I think I better go, Stew. 
ANNE 
I think you should, Miss Gallagher. 
STEW 
Wait a minute, Gallagher. 
Gallagher stops, transfixed by the new tone in his voice. He comes over to Anne. 
209. CLOSE TWO SHOT - ANNE AND STEW 
STEW 
What's the idea, Anne? 
ANNE 
The idea is simply this - that I want those people to leave here immediately. 
STEW 
Now wait a minute. Aren't you being a little unreasonable? 
ANNE 
Unreasonable! Have you any idea what the place looks like downstairs? Do you expect me to stand here and see this place turned into a cheap barroom? 
STEW 
Now wait, don't get excited, Anne. There's no reason for that. Perhaps the boys have had a little too much to drink. That's all right. I'm sorry. I'll go right down and throw them out. That's no reason for you to take this attitude. After all, I certainly have a right to invite a few of my friends to my house, haven't I? 
ANNE 
(pointedly) 
Your house? 
STEW 
(getting the implication; after a pause) 
O-o-oh, I get you 
(a knowing chuckle) 
All right. All right. I don't blame you. I kinda forgot myself for a moment, there. That's what I call getting me told, isn't it, Anne? 
Anne remains silent. That's exactly what she has done. 
STEW 
I suppose I've been boarding out this past year. 
210. MEDIUM SHOT 
He takes his coat off back of chair and slips into it. 
STEW 
(quietly; grimly) 
All right, I'll tell you thisI don't like your boarding house, lady 
As he gathers up loose manuscript, he continues . . . 
STEW 
and if it's all the same to you, I'm moving out. 
ANNE 
Stewart! 
STEW 
(hotly) 
This is something I should have done a long time ago, only I didn't have sense enough to do it. No, I had to stick around here to try and make a success of something that I knew darn well was a failure from the very beginning. But no more. No more! So that's that. 
ANNE 
You can't walk out of here like this. 
Throughout the scene, Stew is gathering his things togetherand probably packing an overnight bag. 
STEW 
Oh I can't? Who's going to stop me? I'd like to see somebody stop me. If you think I'm going to stick around this joint just to look at this mausoleum, not on your life! You're going to make no stuffed shirt out of me. Now what do you think of that? 
Mrs. Schuyler stalks majestically in. 
MRS. SCHUYLER 
What's going on here? Who is this woman? 
STEW 
(snappily) 
Joan of Arc! What's it to you? 
MRS. SCHUYLER 
Heavens! The man's insane! 
211. CLOSEUP - STEW 
STEW 
Sure I'm insane, but I've got some good news for you. 
(points to himself) 
This magnolia is leaving your sweet smelling vanilla joint. This bird in a cage is gonna button his own pants from now on. And that is what is known as telling the mother-in-law. 
Gallagher's cry of joy is cut off by an icy look from Mrs. Schuyler. 
GALLAGHER 
Eurek! 
212. MEDIUM SHOT 
Stew is stuffing things into a bag. 
STEW 
(heatedly to Anne) 
You've done nothing but watch me - watch me! - ever since I've been here. Treated me like a thug, watched me like a hawk, mistrusted me. Every time I leave the house, that Jane 
(indicating Mrs. Schuyler) 
goes out and counts the silverware. 
ANNE 
That's ridiculous. 
It'll be ready in a minute. 
STEW 
(accusingly) 
Never mind that. If you can't get my breakfast ready - and can't get here on time in the morning - then you can go get yourself another job. 
GALLAGHER 
(in mock contrition) 
Sorry, boss 
STEW 
Don't be sorry. Just get the breakfast, that's all. 
219. INT. STEW'S LIVING ROOM - MED. SHOT 
There is a knock on the hall door. 
Stew crosses and opens it. 
220. CLOSER SHOT 
As Stew opens the door. It reveals Dexter Grayson in the little hallway, immaculately clad, as usual. Stew regards him in frank surprise for a moment. 
GRAYSON 
Hello, Smith. 
STEW 
(puzzled) 
Holy jumping swordfish! 
GRAYSON 
I suppose you know why I came? 
STEW 
No, I have no idea - unless some of the silver-ware is missing. 
GRAYSON 
Now don't be absurd, Smith 
(as he brushes past, walking inside) 
May I come in? 
STEW 
Surely, come right in. 
GRAYSON 
(as he sits down) 
Thanks. May I sit down? 
STEW 
Surely, sit down. If I had known you were coming, I would have thrown you up a waffle. 
GRAYSON 
I don't eat waffles. 
STEW 
You don't. 
221. MED. SHOT 
Grayson sits stiffly on one of the Grand Rapids chairs. Stew remains standing, and waits silently for Grayson to speak. Grayson clears his throat. 
GRAYSON 
Anne asked me to come and see you about the divorce. 
STEW 
(with enlightened expression) 
She did? 
GRAYSON 
(uncomfortably) 
She wants me to arrange the financial settlement. 
STEW 
Listen Grayson, I've got 106 bucks and 75 cents in the bank. Now Anne can have any part of that she wants, but she'd better hurry because I'm spending it awfully fast. 
GRAYSON 
(interrupting) 
You don't seem to understand. Anne doesn't expect anything from you. 
222. INT. STEW'S KITCHENETTE - MED. SHOT 
Gallagher. Overcome by curiosity at the sound of voices, she leaves the frying eggs and goes quietly to the doorway and peeks out. 
223. MED. SHOT 
Grayson and Stew. 
GRAYSON 
We should like to know how much you would want to 
Stew stares off incredulously. 
STEW 
(interrupting) 
Wait a minute. Do I get from you that she wants to pay me alimony? 
GRAYSON 
That's putting it crudely, but 
Stew starts advancing nervously toward him. Grayson, a bit alarmed, rises. 
STEW 
(closing in on him) 
Remember what I told you about that twentieth crack? All right, you've just made it. Before you go unconscious I want you to get this through your nut. 
GRAYSON 
I beg your pardon. 
STEW 
Unconscious. You know, when you don't know anything. Your natural state. There are some people - you can't buy their self-respect for a bucket of shekels - well, I happen to be one of those guys. 
224. CLOSE SHOT 
Showing kitchen door open a crack. Gallagher's eyes are glistening as she watches and listens. 
225. MED. CLOSE SHOT 
Stew and Grayson. 
GRAYSON 
(weakly)

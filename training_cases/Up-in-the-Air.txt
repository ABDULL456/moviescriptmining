- Common Pre-Flight Instruction 
A SPOTLIGHT reveals RYAN BINGHAM standing at a PODIUM. 
He unzips a BACKPACK and sets it down beside him. 
RYAN How much does your life weigh? 
Ryan pauses to let us consider this. 
RYAN (CONT'D) Imagine for a second that you're carrying a backpack... I want you to feel the straps on your shoulders... You feel them? (gives us a beat) Now, I want you to pack it with all the stuff you have in your life. Start with the little things. The stuff in drawers and on shelves. The collectables and knick-knacks. Feel the weight as it adds up. Now, start adding the larger stuff. Your clothes, table top appliances, lamps, linens, your TV. That backpack should be getting pretty heavy at this point - Go Bigger. Your couch, your bed, your kitchen table. Stuff it all in... Your car, get it in there... Your home, whether you have a studio apartment or a two story house, I want you to stuff it into that backpack. 
Ryan takes a beat to let the weight sink in. 
RYAN (CONT'D) Now try to walk. 
We hear people around us chuckling. Ryan smiles. Reveal: 
INT. HOTEL CONFERENCE ROOM - AFTERNOON 
The kind that shifts between lower income corporate retreats and lower income weddings. 
The few dozen people seem to be visualizing as told. 
RYAN (CONT'D) Kinda hard, isn't it? This is what we do to ourselves on a daily basis. We weigh ourselves down until we can't even move. And make no mistake - Moving is living. 
We see nodding. People's gears turning. 
RYAN (CONT'D) Now, I'm going to set your backpack on fire. What do you want to take out of it? Photos? Photos are for people who can't remember. Drink some gingko and let the photos burn. In fact let everything burn and imagine waking up tomorrow with nothing. (a beat of emphasis) It's kind of exhilarating isn't it? That is how I approach every day. 
A titter through the crowd. 
INT. BOEING 757 - DAY 
A FEMALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT is looking directly at us. 
FEMALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT Do you want the cancer? 
Turn to see RYAN looking back. 
Handsome. Anonymous. Right now - Confused. 
RYAN Excuse me? 
FEMALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT (SAME DELIVERY) Do you want the cancer? 
Ryan furrows - What the hell is going on here? 
The flight attendant raises her hand to reveal a CAN OF SODA. 
FEMALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT The can, sir? 
RYAN Oh... No. Um, no thank you. 
The flight attendant moves to the next aisle. Ryan takes a beat, then returns to his work. 
INT. SMALL CONFERENCE ROOM, SUN CASUALTY - DAY 
Two words - Subordinate chic. 
Seated at a tiny table is RYAN. The Grim Reaper in a suit. 
We see a series of REAL PEOPLE react to the news of being fired. They should be non-actors (actual victims of recent layoffs) that can react organically to the news with authenticity. Some are hurt. Others are upset and even abusive. The series concludes with... 
STEVE (AN ACTOR) 
... who's on the verge of tears. 
STEVE Who the fuck are you? 
FREEZE on Ryan. 
RYAN (V.O.) Excellent question. Who the fuck am I? Poor Steve has worked here for seven years. 
FLASH IMAGES: 
INT. LOBBY, PHOENIX HILTON - DAY 
Ryan is at the check out desk. 
CHECKOUT GIRL Do you have your Hilton Honors Card with you? 
Ryan smiles... "Do I?" 
He hands it to her, close enough to camera, that we get a nice big close up of it. She runs the card and the screen pops up with information that makes her blush. 
CHECKOUT GIRL Oh my God... Do you like, live, at the Hilton? 
Ryan nods in faux modesty. 
EXT. OUTDOOR CAR RETURN, HERTZ RENT-A-CAR - DAY 
Ryan pulls up to one of the spaces marked with the #1 GOLD PRESIDENTS CLUB emblem. He hops out and a uniformed man with a handheld device begins to punch in the license plate number. 
Ryan pulls out his HERTZ PRESIDENTS CLUB CARD and places it nice and close to lens so we can see it. 
The card slides through the handheld device and we see the DIGITAL NUMBER increase by a few thousand points. 
INT. MAIN CONCOURSE, PHOENIX SKY HARBOR INTL AIRPORT - DAY 
The automated GLASS DOORS slide open. Ryan enters the concourse and takes a deep breath of the temperately controlled air. He has arrived. 
RYAN (V.O.) This is where I live. 
Subtitles - "Airworld" 
Ryan skips the long lines and steps directly into the AAdvantage Executive Platinum line. 
Glorious close-up of Ryan's AAdvantage Executive Platinum CARD sliding through the AUTOMATED MACHINE. Were it any sexier, we'd hear a moan. Maybe we even do. 
Immediately, the AIRPORT CLERK registers and perks up. 
AIRPORT CLERK Pleasure to see you again, Mr. Bingham. 
RYAN (V.O.) When I run my card, the system automatically prompts the desk clerk to greet me with this exact statement. 
We see it again... 
AIRPORT CLERK Pleasure to see you again, Mr. Bingham. 
Ryan nods back to the clerk. 
RYAN (V.O.) Had my status simply been gold or God-forbid, silver. I might have gotten a hello or a smile... Maybe. 
Ryan continues to hit buttons, swiftly checking in. 
RYAN (V.O.) Loyalty is earned and rewarded with these small touches. It's these kinds of systemized friendly touches that keep my world in orbit. 
A ticket begins printing. Ryan snaps it up. 
INT. SECURITY - PHOENIX SKY HARBOR INTL AIRPORT - SAME 
Ryan steps up and observes his line choices. He finds a few Asian businessmen and hops in behind them. 
JUMP CUT TO: 
RYAN MOVING THROUGH THE SECURITY SCREENING 
It's a beautiful choreographed ballet of a bag handle collapsing, shoes coming off, a laptop going in a separate tray, wallet and watch sliding into a shoe, a boarding card sliding into a back pocket... both hands always moving, performing separate actions... It really is gorgeous. 
INT. AMERICAN ADMIRALS CLUB - SAME 
Ryan enters and presents his ADMIRALS CLUB CARD. It has a hologram. The ADMIRALS CLUB HOSTESS immediately smiles. 
ADMIRALS CLUB HOSTESS Welcome back, Mr. Bingham. 
Ryan walks past a stack of newspapers on the way to the buffet, the whole time framed by an enormous window overlooking the tarmac. 
RYAN (V.O.) All the things you probably hate about travelling - The recycled air. The artificial lighting. The digital juice dispensers and mini pizzas stacked to their heat lamps are the warm reminders that I am home. 
With that comment, Ryan slides into a leather club seat. A DIGITAL DISPLAY reads: "Thank You For Your Loyalty". 
He opens his briefcase and pulls out his ITINERARY. He scans it. We see a string of flights, car rentals, and stays at Hitons. Then, something makes him frown. He pulls out his cell phone and dials... 
INTERCUT WITH: 
INT. ASSISTANT'S DESK, CTC - DAY 
Ryan's assistant, Kevin, is not happy to be there. 
Reveal - A man next to Ryan. Some BUSINESSMAN between cities. He talks, drink in hand, but we don't hear him. 
RYAN (V.O.) We start chatting, impersonally at first. Our moderate politics, our sinking opinions on the American service industry. 
BUSINESSMAN AND RYAN MAKING SUGGESTIONS 
RYAN (V.O.) You recommend a hotel in Tulsa. I tip you off to a rib joint in Fort Worth. 
BUSINESSMAN TELLS A JOKE. HIS HANDS GESTURE. 
RYAN (V.O.) You tell me your best joke. I've heard it before, but listen anyway. 
Ryan laughs out loud. 
TURBULENCE. THE BUSINESSMAN TIGHTENS HIS SEAT BELT. 
RYAN (V.O.) Nothing like turbulence to cement a bond. Soon you're telling me about family. 
THE MAN SPEAKS ABOUT SOMETHING THAT OBVIOUSLY DISTURBS HIM. 
RYAN (V.O.) Your wife just went back to work but you can't intervene because you sure could use the extra paycheck and besides, last June she read some book and woke up one morning a feminist. 
THE MAN LEANS BACK, ARMS CROSSED, WITH A FAR OFF LOOK. 
RYAN (V.O.) And that if your windfall ever came through, you'd quit and spend the rest of your days restoring vintage speedboats. (saying it with him) The water. That's where you belong. 
EXT. TARMAC, DALLAS FORT WORTH AIRPORT - DAY 
Their PLANE LANDS. 
INT. BOEING 757 - DAY 
As the plane begins to taxi to the gate, both Ryan and the Businessman pull out their cards. 
RYAN (V.O.) We exchange cards and slot them next to countless others. 
The dull bell "dings" to let us know it's safe to stand. Ryan and the Businessman get up and open the overheads. 
RYAN (V.O.) Fast friends aren't my only friends, but my best friends. 
INT. CONCOURSE, DALLAS FORT WORTH AIRPORT - DAY 
Ryan and the Businessman walk next to each, now completely ignoring each other as if they never shared a word. 
RYAN (V.O.) Sad? Not really. We're a busy bunch. I'm peaceful. I'm in my element here. I suppose I'm a sort of mutation, a new species. I live between the margins of my itineraries. 
Ryan and the Businessman reach a point that separates - CONNECTING FLIGHTS go left / LONG TERM PARKING goes right. 
They share an awkward smile with a nod, then head in their separate directions. 
INT. BROOKS BROTHERS, DALLAS FORT WORTH AIRPORT - DAY 
Ryan is checking out TIES when his cell phone rings. He checks the I.D.- UNAVAILABLE. He weighs it for a second. 
RYAN (PICKS UP) Hello? 
KARA (O.C.) Hi Ryan. 
Ryan mouths a silent "fuck". 
INTERCUT WITH: 
INT. KARA'S KITCHEN - NIGHT 
Kara is Ryan's sister. Her home overflows with books, photos, family collectables, and kid's artwork. 
RYAN (V.O.) Every family has one person who is the glue. The one who keeps the genealogy in check. That's my sister Kara - The glue. 
It just so happens that Kara is GLUING her daughter's school project mobile together. 
RYAN Hey Kara. 
KARA How are you holding up? 
RYAN Just fine. You? The kids? 
KARA (LYING) Missy's outstanding. Matthew made varsity. How's the road? 
Ryan exits the store and we realize we are in... 
INT. CONCOURSE, DALLAS FORT WORTH AIRPORT - DAY 
Ryan hops onto a PEOPLE MOVER. 
INT. BAR LOUNGE - HOUSTON HILTON - LATER THAT EVENING 
Empty glasses litter the table. Ryan and Alex have taken over a couch and have the contents of their wallets spread out - All MEMBERSHIP CARDS. 
RYAN (grabs one of Alex's cards) Maplewood Card? How dare you bring that into this palace. 
ALEX Hilton offers equal value and better food - But the Maplewood gives out warm cookies at check in. 
RYAN They got you with the cookies? 
ALEX I'm a sucker for simulated hospitality. 
RYAN There's actually an industry term for that. It's a mixture of faux and homey. It's faumey. 
Alex grabs Ryan's AMERICAN CONCIERGE KEY CARD. 
ALEX Oh my God. I've heard about these, but never seen one in person. Is this a...? 
RYAN Concierge Key. Yeah. 
ALEX I love the weight. 
RYAN Graphite. I was pretty excited the day that puppy came in. 
ALEX I'll say. I put up pretty pedestrian numbers. Sixty thou a year, domestic. 
RYAN (TRYING) That's not bad. 
ALEX Don't patronize me. What's your total? 
RYAN That's a personal question. 
ALEX Oh please... 
RYAN (PLAYFUL) I hardly know you. 
ALEX Show some hubris. Impress me. (SUGGESTIVE) I bet it's huge. 
RYAN You have no idea. 
ALEX Come on... (holds her hands eight INCHES APART) Is it this big? (extends a few inches) ... this big? 
RYAN Let's just say I've got a number in mind and I haven't hit it yet. 
Alex smiles, fair enough. Admires the CONCIERGE KEY CARD. 
ALEX This is pretty fucking sexy. 
RYAN I hope it doesn't cheapen our relationship. 
ALEX We're two people who get turned on by elite status. We may have to settle for cheap. 
RYAN There's nothing cheap about loyalty. 
Alex looks into Ryan's eyes and gives him unspoken permission to take her right there and then. 
INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Ryan and Alex walk down a curved corridor, suppressing laughter. There's no adult way to go back to somebody's hotel room. Once at the door, Ryan tries his KEY CARD, but it doesn't work. 
He reaches into his pocket and comes up with five other key cards from recent trips. 
RYAN I really have to start throwing these out. 
He tries a couple. 
ALEX We can always use that room with the ice machine. 
Ryan chuckles. He finds the right key and opens the door. 
INT. RYAN'S SUITE, HOUSTON HILTON - LATER THAT NIGHT 
Everything is scattered from a marathon Fuck. Ryan and Alex are laying on the bed, sprawled out on their backs like murder victims. 
RYAN Good call on the towel rack. 
ALEX Thanks. I liked how you burritoed me in the sofa cushions. 
RYAN I was improvising. 
ALEX Too bad we didn't make it to the closet. 
RYAN We got to do this again. 
RYAN It's fine. Really. I'll go with the majority. 
NOSEY NEIGHBOR Sometimes I forget that you even live here. You could probably save money and move into a hotel. 
RYAN (DEAD SERIOUS) I looked into it, but the IRS requires a permanent address for employment. Otherwise, they classify you as a vagrant. 
Ding! - Ryan gets off at his floor. 
NOSEY NEIGHBOR Oh. 
INT. RYAN'S APARTMENT, OMAHA - DAY 
Ryan walks in and sets his bag down. Reveal - the place is empty... Like empty, empty. 
Ryan opens the fridge - Chinese take out. Pizza box. Bottle of Vodka. Takes a whiff of something - not good. 
WOMAN'S VOICE Hey neighbor. 
Ryan turns to find Dianne, a pretty woman just shy of forty. 
RYAN Hey yourself. 
They hug - It's just intimate enough to know they've violated the rules of sleeping with your neighbors. 
DIANNE (hands over a package) I signed for this while you were gone. 
RYAN Thanks. Hope it wasn't a bother. 
Ryan opens it and finds the CUT-OUT of his sister Julie and her fiance Jim. It's an eighteen inch card stock photo of Jim hugging Julie from behind. 
DIANNE (RE: PHOTO) They seem happy. 
RYAN It's my sister. She's getting married. Haven't met the guy yet. 
DIANNE Lots of luck. 
RYAN I know, right? 
They share a smile. Then, Dianne goes to leave. 
DIANNE It's good to see you. Feels like a while this time. 
RYAN Hey, you want to come over tonight? 
Dianne gets a little uncomfortable. 
DIANNE Actually, I kind of started seeing somebody. 
RYAN Oh, that's... that's great. 
DIANNE Yeah, we're having drinks tonight if you want to come over. 
RYAN That's okay... I' think I'll settle in. 
Dianne gives a smile/nod and exits. Ryan take another long look at the CUT-OUT. He shakes his head. 
EXT. CTC HEADQUARTERS, CTC - MORNING 
A downtown midsize high rise. 
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 
The company has piled in, standing room only. Assistants and interns watch through the windows. 
Craig addresses the group including his own superiors. 
CRAIG GREGORY Just thrilled to have everyone under one roof. Welcome home boys. 
A couple odd looks from road warriors a decade his senior. 
CRAIG GREGORY (CONT'D) I know there's are lot of whispering about why we're all here. (MORE) 
CRAIG GREGORY (CONT'D) Retailers are down twenty percent. Auto industry is in the dump. Housing market doesn't have a heartbeat. This is our moment. It's one of the worst times on record for America... and I don't want to be standing here two years from now, wondering how we missed this window of opportunity. 
A strangely encouraged response from the group. 
CRAIG GREGORY (CONT'D) Now, last Summer we received a dynamite young woman by way of Cornell. She challenged us with some big ideas. My first reaction was, who does this kid think she is? But when I started to give a listen, I was pretty knocked out. So now, with a little peek into our future - Natalie Keener. 
Natalie stands up. 
NATALIE If there's one word I want to leave you with today, it's this... 
Natalie clicks on her POWER POINT PRESENTATION. 
CRAIG GREGORY Ryan, Coke and IBM have been doing it for years. Just like anything, there's a few months of transition, but everyone settles in. 
RYAN Who are you taking off the road? 
A beat. 
CRAIG GREGORY You don't get it. You're grounded, Ryan. Everyone is. It's done. 
RYAN Okay, what we do here is brutal and leaves people devastated, but there's a dignity to the way I do it. 
CRAIG GREGORY Stabbing people in the chest instead of the back? 
Ryan rolls his eyes. 
Craig's door opens and Natalie pops her head in. 
NATALIE You wanted to see me? 
Craig goes to wave her off. 
RYAN Yeah, why don't you come in. 
Natalie is confused but takes the chair next to Ryan. 
CRAIG GREGORY Great job in there, Nat. 
NATALIE Thank you. How's everyone taking it? 
Natalie and Ryan hold a look for a second. 
RYAN (TO NATALIE) Look, I appreciate your... zeal. And you have some good ideas. But you know nothing of the realities of my job. Sure, you can set up an iChat... but you don't know how people think. 
NATALIE Actually, I minored in psychology. 
CRAIG GREGORY Nice. 
RYAN (TO NATALIE) Okay kiddo, fire me. 
CRAIG GREGORY Ryan, stop it. 
RYAN She's going to be doing this on a regular basis. You don't want to know if she can fire somebody? 
CRAIG GREGORY She just fired Ned. 
RYAN My dog could fire Ned. (TO NATALIE) Fire me. 
CRAIG GREGORY Ryan. 
NATALIE It's okay, I got this. 
Ryan and Natalie turn to face each other. 
NATALIE (CONT'D) Mr. Bingham, I regret to inform you that your position is no longer available. 
RYAN Who the hell are you? 
NATALIE My name is Miss Keener and I'm here today to discuss your future. 
RYAN My future? I don't know you. The only person who can fire me is Craig Gregory. 
NATALIE Mr. Gregory hired me to handle this for him. 
RYAN Handle what? Handle me? Mr. Gregory hired me and he's the only one who can fire me. I'm going to talk to him. 
Ryan gets up. Natalie gets up too. 
NATALIE Mr. Bingham... 
RYAN You can't follow me... You're on a computer screen. Remember? 
NATALIE (FRUSTRATED) Ryan... 
Ryan sits back down. 
RYAN Try again. Fire me. 
NATALIE I just did. 
RYAN Actually, you didn't. Now, fire me. 
CRAIG GREGORY Stop it, Ryan. 
NATALIE (IGNORES CRAIG) Mr. Bingham, I'm here today to inform you that your position is no longer available. 
Ryan is packing his ROLL-AWAY BAG. It is practiced and systematic. He's just about finished, when he notices the CUT- OUT of his sister's engagement photo. 
He tries placing it in the open bag, but it is immediately clear that the photo is two inches to long. He tries putting it on an angle, but that doesn't help. 
RYAN Huh. 
Ryan centers the cut-out again and tries to ZIP around it, but he can't get the zipper around the HEADS of the photo. For a moment, it almost seems like he's assaulting their tiny head with the zipper handle. Doesn't help. 
A moment of silent frustration. 
CUT TO: 
THE ROLL-AWAY 
Being pulled through an airport. The little heads of Ryan's sister and her fiance are poking out the top of the bag. The two zippers have been closed on either side of them as though they were tiny passengers peeking out the sunroof. 
INT. EPPLEY AIRFIELD, OMAHA - MORNING 
Ryan cuts right through the crowd, wheeling his carry-on towards the automatic check-in machines. 
Ryan stops when he notices NATALIE saying goodbye to her BOYFRIEND - a kind of Hollister looking guy in his mid- twenties. He's not thrilled by the public affection. After a beat, they break and he exits. 
Natalie sees Ryan and starts dragging her LARGE SUITCASE towards him. The SCRAPING against the terrazzo sends a shiver up Ryan's spine. 
She arrives and sets the heavy bag down with a CLUNK. Ryan stares at her travel case for a beat then up to her. 
NATALIE What? 
CUT TO: 
A ROW OF ROLL AWAY BAGS 
INT. LUGGAGE STORE, EPPLEY AIRFIELD - MORNING 
Ryan pulls one out and tests the action. 
NATALIE I really like my luggage. 
RYAN That's exactly what it is. Luggage. (off of Natalie's look) You know how much time you lose by checking in? 
NATALIE I don't know, maybe five minutes waiting for... 
RYAN Thirty five minutes per flight. I travel two hundred seventy days a year. That makes one hundred fifty seven hours... That's Seven Days. (points to her luggage) You ready to throw away a whole week on that? 
INT. TERMINAL FLOOR, EPPLEY AIRFIELD - MORNING 
Natalie is attempting to repack her new bag in the middle of the airport. Ryan helps by throwing a couple things out. 
INT. SECURITY, EPPLEY AIRFIELD- MORNING 
Ryan spots various "bad lines", then sees a group of Asians. 
RYAN Bingo. Asians. 
Ryan starts walking. 
NATALIE You can't be serious. 
As they pass the first line - A FAMILY OF SIX. 
RYAN Never get behind people travelling with infants. I've never seen a stroller collapse in less than twenty minutes. 
Second Line - AN ELDERLY COUPLE 
RYAN (CONT'D) Old people are worse. Their bodies are littered with hidden metal and they never seem to appreciate how little time they have left on Earth. 
Third Line - A COUPLE MIDDLE EASTERN GUYS. 
RYAN (CONT'D) Five words. Randomly selected for additional screening. 
They enter the fourth line behind the Asians. 
RYAN (CONT'D) Asians. They're light packers, treasure efficiency, and have a thing for slip-on shoes. God love'em. 
NATALIE That's racist. 
RYAN I'm like my mother. I stereotype. It's faster. 
INT. SECURITY, EPPLEY AIRFIELD MOMENTS LATER 
Ryan is just fastening his belt, having just gone through security, when we hear a beeping go off. Natalie is trying to find the metal on her body that has set off the machine. She also has forgotten to take her laptop out of her bag. It's a mess. 
INT. BOEING 757 - MID FLIGHT 
Ding - The elevator door opens. 
INT. RECEPTION, BOTTLING COMPANY - DAY 
Ryan and Natalie enter the door to find a reception desk on an empty floor. Scattered telephones sit on the ground where desks used to be. A few desks in one corner are still manned. 
Natalie tries not to show: It's all becoming very real. 
RYAN (to desk girl) Ryan Bingham, from CTC. 
The desk girl looks up from her work. She knows who they are. 
INT. CUBICLE CITY, BOTTLING COMPANY - DAY 
Ryan and Natalie pass rows of cubicles. Heads begin to pop up to see their arrival. Natalie accidentally makes eye contact with one guy, then quickly shifts her gaze forward. 
INT. WINDOWLESS CONFERENCE ROOM, BOTTLING COMPANY - DAY 
Ryan and Natalie sit next to each other at a polyurethane conference table. 
RYAN All you have to do today is watch and listen. When I talk about the strategy packet. You hand them one of these... 
Ryan points to a stack of packets. 
NATALIE You ever find it strange that termination comes with a packet. 
RYAN Everything important in life comes with a packet. 
MONTAGE OF MORE REAL PEOPLE REACTING TO BEING FIRED 
A SERIES OF REAL PEOPLE sit down across from Ryan and Natalie 
RYAN Thank you for coming by. As you're probably well aware, this is a tough economic climate and your company is not immune. 
REAL PEOPLE tighten up as they begin to catch on. 
RYAN While I wish I was here with better news, the reason you and I are meeting is this is your final week of employment here. 
REAL PEOPLE blame all sorts of people and situations that they personally hold responsible. 
RYAN This is not a time to look for blame. Your position simply no longer exists. 
REAL PEOPLE respond further. Some are enraged. Some are polite. One is even grateful. 
RYAN I understand why you are saying these things. (MORE) 
RYAN (CONT'D) It's perfectly natural to feel this way. I want you to take the next week to explore this strategy packet... 
Ryan nods to Natalie who we now see begrudgingly HANDING PACKETS to all of the REAL PEOPLE we've already met. 
RYAN Fill out the skill set work sheet... Use the hopes and dreams diagram... And the tree of aspirations. 
We SEE the "TREE OF ASPIRATIONS" sheet. 
RYAN (WITH EMPHASIS) The answers are all in there. 
We see more packets getting handed out as Ryan repeats... 
RYAN The answers are all in there. (ANOTHER PERSON) The answers... (ANOTHER PERSON) The answers... (ANOTHER PERSON) ... are-all-in-there. 
CUT TO: 
BOB (AN ACTOR) PRESENTING A PHOTO OF HIS CHILDREN 
BOB And what do you suggest I tell them? 
BOB. Dry red eyes from tears of rage stare down the lens. 
Natalie can't hold back any longer. 
NATALIE (A SUGGESTION) Perhaps you're underestimating the positive effect your career transition may have on your children. 
Ryan looks at Natalie like she's out of her mind. 
BOB Positive effect? 
NATALIE Well, tests have shown that children under moderate trauma have a tendency to apply themselves academically as a method of coping. 
BOB Go fuck yourself. That's what my kids'll think. 
Natalie shrinks. Ryan immediately covers. 
RYAN Your children's admiration is important to you? 
INT. RESTAURANT BAR, ST. LOUIS HILTON - EVENING 
Natalie sits back down at the table a little visibly shaken. 
RYAN You okay? 
NATALIE (COVERS QUICKLY) Yeah. Fine. 
Just then, their food arrives... And there's a lot of food. Natalie's eyes move back and forth trying to figure out why there seems to be three main courses and a bunch of sides. 
NATALIE Hungry, much? 
RYAN Our expense account allots for forty dollars each on dinner. I plan on grabbing every mile I can. 
NATALIE Okay, you got to fill me in on this mile business. What's that all about? Are you talking like frequent flier miles? 
Ryan gives Natalie a look - Is she ready for this information? 
RYAN Your really want to know? 
NATALIE (MOCK SERIOUS) I'm dying to know. 
RYAN I don't spend a nickel, if I can help it, unless it somehow profits my mileage account. I'm not talking hotel rooms and rental cars either, but internet services, cell phone, music downloads, teleflorists. The works. I shop them according to the miles they pay and I pit them against each other for the most value. 
NATALIE So, what are you saving up for? Hawaii? South of France? 
RYAN No, it's not like that... The miles are the goal. 
NATALIE That's it? You're saving to save? 
RYAN Let's just say I've got a number in mind and haven't hit it yet. 
NATALIE Wow. Seems a little abstract. What's your target? 
RYAN I'd rather not. 
NATALIE (TEASING) It's a secret target? 
RYAN It's ten million miles. 
NATALIE Huh. Isn't ten million just a number? 
RYAN Pi is just a number. 
NATALIE I guess we all need a hobby. 
Ryan looks back at Natalie - Hobby? 
NATALIE (CONT'D) Oh hey, I didn't mean to belittle your collection. I get it. Sounds cool. 
RYAN I'd be the seventh person to do it. More people have walked on the moon. 
NATALIE Do they give you a parade or something? 
RYAN Lifetime Exec Platinum status. You get to meet the Chief Pilot, Maynard Finch. And... They put your name on the side of a plane. 
NATALIE Men get such a hard-on from putting their name on stuff... You guys don't grow up - You just need to pee on everything. 
RYAN Now, who's stereotyping? 
NANCY Fear of mortality. It's like Yes, you're going to die one day. 
RYAN And why do you suppose that's singular to men? 
NATALIE Probably cause you can't have babies. 
Ryan can't help but laugh a little. 
NATALIE (CONT'D) If I had that many miles, I'd just show up at the airport, look up at one of those big destination boards, pick a place and go. 
This idea sinks in for a second with both of them. 
INT. RYAN'S ROOM, ST. LOUIS HILTON - NIGHT 
Ryan is laying in bed wearing a Hilton bathrobe. He's reviewing his sister's wedding invite when his BLACKBERRY BUZZES on the night stand. He reaches over to check it. It's a text message: 
Alex: "Can't fall asleep." 
Ryan types back: 
Ryan: "Me too. Just laying here." 
INTERCUT WITH: 
KAREN You don't have to sugar coat it. I get the drill. What are they offering? 
NATALIE Inside the packet you'll find a clearly worked out severance package. 
KAREN Give me the bullet points. 
NATALIE Three months pay. Six months medical. A full year of placement services through our company, CTC. 
KAREN Placement services? How generous. 
NATALIE Commonly, it takes one month of searching for every ten thousand dollars you expect to earn in salary. 
KAREN So I could be looking for a while. 
NATALIE Not necessarily... 
KAREN Oh, don't sweat it. I'm pretty confident about my plans. 
NATALIE (SPIRITS LIFTED) Oh yeah? 
KAREN Yeah. Can you tell me? Is high tide in the morning or the evening? 
NATALIE I don't know. Why? 
KAREN There's this beautiful bridge by my apartment. I need to figure out what time to jump off it. 
Natalie begins to tremble. 
EXT. WICHITA SECURITIES COMPANY COURTYARD - DAY 
Natalie bursts out the doors and sits on a bench. She's freaked out. Ryan is five steps behind her. He puts a hand on her shoulder. 
RYAN People say these things all the time. It comes with the trade. 
NATALIE They do? 
RYAN Sure. People are always saying crazy stuff. They get worked up. 
NATALIE She was so calm. 
RYAN (not quite sure) I think that's a good sign. 
NATALIE So they don't actually ever do it? 
RYAN No... it's just talk. 
NATALIE How do you know? Do you follow up? 
RYAN I mean, no, nothing good can come of that, but I don't think you should worry about it. 
Natalie is clearly still worried. 
RYAN (CONT'D) This is the job. Taking people at their most fragile moment and setting them adrift. 
BEGIN MONTAGE 
A PLANE PULLING BACK ITS GATE AND TAKING OFF 
WHITE COLLAR PEOPLE ARE HANDED PACKETS 
RYAN AND ALEX ENTERING A NEW HOTEL ROOM. THEY'RE BECOMING MORE COMFORTABLE WITH EACH OTHER 
INT. BOEING 757 - DAY 
Looking out the window at the passing landscape. 
Over the pastures and roads, we see GRAPHIC WHITE LINES AND NUMBERS denoting each mile as they click by. 
Ryan tears a page out of AMERICAN WAY MAGAZINE outlining their mileage program and hands it to Natalie. 
GARDENER DRIVES A RIDER MOWER ACROSS A TINY STRETCH OF GRASS 
INT. HILTON HOTEL LOBBY - EARLY MORNING 
Ryan turns a corner to find Natalie talking to her computer screen with headphones on. 
She's having an iChat with someone, but we only hear her side of the conversation. Ryan decides to listen in for a second. 
NATALIE I'll be back soon. Not really sure how long this whole exercise is supposed to last. He's fine... It's hard for these guys to accept change, you know. (listens, rolls eyes) I... I'm not even going to answer that... No, I can't even think of him that way... He's old. 
Ryan frowns. Checks a mirror. 
A NEW OFFICE - MORE EMPLOYEES REACT TO BEING LAID OFF 
NATALIE Someone to talk to, spend your life with? 
RYAN I'm surrounded by people to talk to. I doubt that will change. 
The shuttle stops and everyone goes to grab their bags. 
INT. LOBBY, MIAMI HILTON - DAY 
Ryan and Natalie enter, still having the same conversation. 
NATALIE How about just not dying alone? 
Ryan stops to address this. 
RYAN Starting when I was twelve, we moved each one of my grandparents into a nursing facility. My parents went the same way. (A BEAT) Make no mistake. We all die alone. 
Ryan turns, thinks of something, then turns back. 
RYAN (CONT'D) (ADDING) Those cult members down in San Diego with the white sneakers and little Dixie cups of Kool-Aid. They didn't die alone. 
Natalie looks steamed. 
RYAN (CONT'D) Just saying - There's options. 
Out of nowhere, Natalie starts crying. 
RYAN (ALMOST SILENT) Oh fuck. 
Natalie is now balling in the middle of the lobby. 
NATALIE Brian left me. 
RYAN Oh, hey... I... 
Ryan goes to hug Natalie and she simply folds into his arms - A mop of tears. Ryan looks around for a place to set her down. Instead, he finds... 
ALEX - Who gives a questioning look to the young sobbing girl. 
RYAN Hi. Alex this is Natalie. Natalie, this is my... friend, Alex. 
ALEX I should give you both a moment. 
Natalie attempts a recovery. It's not graceful. 
NATALIE No, it's fine. I'm fine. Just stupid emotions. 
Natalie gives Alex a firm handshake. 
ALEX Maybe a drink? 
Ryan goes to challenge the idea, when... 
NATALIE Now we're talking. 
Natalie leads the way. Alex and Ryan exchange quick hellos. 
CUT TO: 
THE SCREEN OF NATALIE'S CELL PHONE 
TEXT READS: "I Think it's time we c other people" 
INT. BAR LOUNGE - MIAMI HILTON - MOMENTS LATER 
The three share a booth. Natalie is sipping a drink. She seems to have settled a little. 
ALEX He broke up with you over text message? 
RYAN (SOFT DIG) That's kind of like firing people over the internet. 
Both Natalie and Alex shoot Ryan a look. 
ALEX (re: the ex-boyfriend) What a weasely prick. 
NATALIE Yeah, but what does that make me? Someone who falls for a prick? 
ALEX We all fall for them. Pricks are spontaneous, unpredictable, and fun. And then we're surprised when they turn out to be pricks. 
NATALIE I followed him to Omaha. 
RYAN You did? 
NATALIE I had a job waiting for me in San Fran, when he got an offer from ConAgra. He told me we could start a life together. So I followed him. 
Ryan, Alex, and Natalie wheel their ROLL-AWAYS towards the elevator. 
NATALIE So, what's the plan for this evening? 
Ryan and Alex share an uncomfortable silence. 
NATALIE What...? Oh, is it illicit? 
RYAN (QUICKLY) No... 
ALEX It's nothing like that. 
NATALIE We are in Miami. 
RYAN ... We were going to hit that party for the tech conference in the hotel. 
Natalie notices a group of SOFTWARE TYPES mingling with badges around their necks. 
NATALIE I didn't know you could just attend those... 
ALEX Well, I mean... 
NATALIE (EYES WIDEN) You're going to crash it? 
RYAN ALEX I mean, I don't know if... More money than they know These guy put on a quite a what to do with... party... 
NATALIE No, I get it. I'm in! 
INT. CONFERENCE CORRIDOR, MIAMI HILTON - NIGHT 
Ryan, Alex, and Natalie confidently walk up to the CHECK-IN TABLE and take BADGES. 
They turn the corner. Alex reads Natalie's badge. 
ALEX Jennifer Chu? 
NATALIE Oh shit! 
RYAN It's going to be fine. 
INT. SOFTWARE CONVENTION PARTY, MIAMI HILTON - NIGHT 
Corporate color balloons. Lots of guys in LOGO POLOS. That great hip hop song from 1998 is playing over the PA. 
We find Ryan, Alex, and Natalie at a stand up table. They're now wearing badges. Natalie is pretty tipsy at this point. 
RYAN (TO NATALIE) You okay there? 
NATALIE Oh yeah... This was a great idea. (TO ALEX) You are so pretty. You're exactly what I want to look like in fifteen years. 
ALEX Thank you, Natalie. 
A CONFERENCE LEADER steps up to an on stage MIC. 
CONFERENCE LEADER How's everyone doing out there?! 
People cheer. So do Ryan, Alex, and particularly Natalie. 
CONFERENCE LEADER I'm going to need you to all put your hands together for a very special guest - YOUNG... M... C! 
The opening beats of the 90's jam "Bust-A-Move" blast over the speakers and sure enough, now-40-year-old rapper, Young MC steps out and starts rapping. 
YOUNG MC THIS HERE'S A TALE FOR ALL THE FELLAS... TRY TO DO WHAT THOSE LADIES TELL US... GET SHOT DOWN CAUSE YOU'RE OVERZEALOUS... PLAY HARD TO GET, FEMALES GET JEALOUS... 
Everyone goes crazy and starts dancing. 
Ryan and Alex make it out to the dance floor. They're awful dancers, but they're having fun. 
RYAN Think she'll be okay? 
ALEX Look... 
Natalie has already found a dancing partner, who can't believe his luck. She's all over him. Ryan smiles. 
EXT. BOAT - NIGHT 
A nice two story yacht that was obviously purchased before the bubble popped. Inside the galley, a group is playing karaoke. NATALIE, wearing BADGES like Mardi Gras beads, is singing "Time After Time". 
Meanwhile, near the back, Ryan and Alex sit with their legs hanging off the back of the hull. 
ALEX Back home, I don't get to act the way I do with you. 
RYAN That's why I don't have a "back home". 
Natalie, once confident, now takes pause. 
RYAN She's hardly ready for this. 
CRAIG GREGORY I've been watching her. She's great. 
RYAN (re: the webcam) This is a whole other animal... 
CRAIG GREGORY I mean, she created it. Natalie, you not up for it? 
NATALIE I'm... I'm game. 
CRAIG GREGORY Atta girl. 
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, DETROIT COMPANY - MOMENTS LATER 
Ryan and Natalie have a moment aside. 
RYAN Just remember, don't apologize. Don't tell them how hard this is for you. Today is one of the worst days they will ever have. What we feel doesn't even compare. 
NATALIE Got it. 
RYAN Just keep it professional. You're going to do fine. 
INT. CRAIG GREGORY'S OFFICE, CTC - LATER 
Craig is leaning back in his office chair, watching Natalie on his monitor. 
INT. ALTERNATE CONFERENCE ROOM, DETROIT COMPANY - DAY 
An unsuspecting man in his mid fifties enters the room and takes a seat at a COMPUTER TERMINAL. 
(for the remainder of the scene, we will intercut between Natalie's room and the POV of the man's iChat session.) 
NATALIE Hello, Mr. Samuels. My name is Natalie Keener. 
SAMUELS (checking out the PC) What's going on here? 
NATALIE I wish I was here with better news, however your position here at Deckers is no longer available. 
SAMUELS What are you talking about? 
NATALIE You've been let go. 
SAMUELS What, just like that? I can't believe... Who are you? 
NATALIE My name is Miss Keener. I am here to tell you about your options... 
SAMUELS I work here for seventeen years and they send some fourth grader in here to can me? What the fuck is this?! 
Ryan fights the urge to jump in. He is sitting next to Natalie, but just out of view of the camera. 
NATALIE It's perfectly normal to be upset. However, the sooner you can tell yourself that there are greater opportunities waiting for you... 
SAMUELS Greater opportunities? I'm fifty- seven-fucking years old! 
Mr. Samuels is now on the verge of tears. Eyes red. 
NATALIE Anybody who ever built an empire, or changed the world, sat where you are now. And it's because they sat there that they were able to do it. 
We remain in the room with Natalie and Ryan, but we hear Mr. Samuels crying. It's loud and embarrassing. It's coming from the next room. He's literally on the other side of the wall. 
NATALIE (CONT'D) There's a packet in front of you. 
Samuels picks up the packet and opens it. 
NATALIE (CONT'D) I want you to take some time and review it. 
Samuels begins to leaf through. 
NATALIE (CONT'D) All the answers you're looking for are inside those pages. (MORE) 
NATALIE (CONT'D) The sooner you trust the process, the sooner your next step in life will unveil itself. 
Samuels puts down the packet. The tears still coming slowly. 
NATALIE (CONT'D) I need you to return to your office now and begin to put together your personal things. 
Samuels doesn't move. He's just sitting there in a daze. 
NATALIE (CONT'D) Thank you for your time, Mr. Samuels. 
No reaction. Just more silent tears. Natalie is getting nervous. 
RYAN (O.C.) Okay, start walking it in from the left. 
ALEX enters frame, carrying the engagement CUT OUT. 
ALEX I have to admit, when you asked me to meet you in Vegas... I thought we'd gamble, make out in a heart shaped jacuzzi, maybe see one of those weird French Canadian circus shows. 
RYAN There'll be plenty of time for all that. (directing the photo) One more foot to the left. 
Alex obliges. She checks out the engagement photo. 
ALEX How do you feel about the wedding? 
RYAN I'm fine, I guess. (directing the photo) Okay great... walk away. 
Ryan takes the photo. 
Alex picks up the engagement photo. 
ALEX They're a cute couple. 
RYAN Think so? 
ALEX Yeah, they'll make cute kids. If they're lucky, maybe look a little like you. 
Alex and Ryan look at the photo together for a second. 
RYAN How do you like Wisconsin in February? 
ALEX Who doesn't? (SWEETLY) (MORE) 
ALEX (CONT'D) I like it if you're there. Besides, I know a killer burger in Milwaukee. 
RYAN Northern Wisconsin. (CLARIFYING) What are you doing this weekend? 
This quickly registers... He's inviting me to the wedding. 
ALEX (CONT'D) No... 
RYAN What? I haven't even... 
ALEX I can't. 
RYAN Why not? 
ALEX I couldn't. 
RYAN I'm being serious. 
ALEX You want me to be your date? 
RYAN Well... Yeah. 
ALEX To a wedding... Jesus, Ryan. Your sister's wedding? 
RYAN It's not like I know her that well. 
ALEX I'm just not sure if it's appropriate for me to... 
RYAN Look. You know. I'm not the wedding type. But for the first time in my life... I don't want to be that guy, alone with his drink. I want a dancing partner. I want a plus one. And if you can stomach it, I'd like it to be you. 
A long thoughtful beat. Alex sighs. 
ALEX Okay. 
RYAN Really? 
ALEX Yeah, I can't believe I... Yeah, I'm in. When is it? 
RYAN I feel like we should kiss or something. 
ALEX Then kiss me. 
They do. 
INT. BAGGAGE CAROUSEL, MILWAUKEE AIRPORT - DAY 
Two ROLL-AWAYS side-by-side, moving through the terminal. 
Ryan and Alex walk in unison. They share a smile. Almost like they can't believe they're getting away with something. 
They pass a LARGE AIRLINE ADVERTISEMENT featuring MAYNARD FINCH in uniform. "We Value Your Loyalty." 
EXT. DRIVEWAY, CHALET SUITES - DAY 
ALEX The basket was very lovely. 
JULIE Tammy wrapped all of them. 
Tammy waves. 
JULIE (CONT'D) Ryan, you look so grown up. 
RYAN Me? You're the one getting married. 
JULIE I know, right? You haven't even seen my ring. 
Julie shows off her ring. It's not quite balanced and seems to favor quantity over quality. 
JULIE (CONT'D) (PROUDLY) Jim designed it. 
JIM raises a hand. This is Julie's husband-to-be and we can tell immediately that Ryan isn't thrilled. 
Ryan thinks of something. He pulls out the 5X7 PHOTOS they took of the JIM & JULIE CUT OUT. 
RYAN I brought those photos you were asking for... 
JULIE (LIGHTS UP) Oh great! They go over there. 
Julie points to a table and Ryan walks over. When he gets there, we see almost a hundred photos pinned to a map of America. It's overwhelming. All of a sudden, his effort seems miniscule. 
Ryan begins to pin his photos on the map over the cities where they were taken. He backs away to see it as a whole and his addition has already become invisible. 
Ryan returns to the conversation with his sister and Alex. 
RYAN There were quite a few already up there. Almost couldn't find room. 
JULIE I know, isn't it great how everyone chipped in? 
RYAN What gave you the idea to do something so... 
ALEX (HELPS) ... Substantial? 
JULIE Well, Jim has a lot of our nest egg invested in this real estate venture right now. So when we went over our finances, a honeymoon just didn't seem affordable this second... So I thought... Hey, just because we can't travel doesn't mean we can't have pictures. 
The idea of this lands on Ryan pretty hard. 
ALEX It was a great idea. 
JULIE Thanks. 
CUT TO: 
AN HOUR LATER 
Ryan is stuck with Jim, talking real estate. Alex is having a chat with the brides maids about local relationship drama. 
JIM It's sixty acres up against the foothills. I subdivided the old Lazy W Ranch and took a nice slice for myself. 
RYAN Sounds nice. 
Jim makes an exhale noise that means "you bet your ass". 
JIM Homes will go in the high fours. 
RYAN Must be a nice development. 
JIM (CORRECTING) It's a community, not a development. The concept is turn-key everything. You buy a maintenance contract with the home. We'll whack your weeds, we'll even change the light bulb. Furniture? You buy your own or choose a package. Seamless traditionalism, yet all the perks. 
RYAN Nice. 
Ryan and Alex make eye contact. There's a joy in their connection amongst the ramblings of their company. 
JIM We all need a place to call our own. This is America. This is what we were promised. 
RYAN That's a nice touch. 
JIM What? 
RYAN That bit at the end about promise... I like it. 
JIM (a little embarrassed) Thanks. (LEADING) So, you still renting that one- bedroom? 
RYAN I gave it up. 
JIM (SURPRISED) You own now? 
RYAN No. 
Ryan sits on a sofa, holding his BACKPACK. A slick GOALQUEST HOST enters the room. 
GOALQUEST HOST You ready to rock? 
Ryan nods and gets up. 
INT. CONVENTION HALL, LAS VEGAS - DAY 
Ryan stands in the wings. He takes a breath, then steps out in front of a sea of people. 
The GOALQUEST XX stage is like nothing we've seen yet. Large and professional. Blue Banners hang from the ceiling. Digital projectors show Ryan's Headshot - What's In Your Backpack? 
Ryan sets the BACK PACK on a table and quickly unzips it. 
A breath. 
RYAN Last year, I flew three hundred fifty thousand miles. The moon is only two fifty. 
A long beat. Uncomfortable. Ryan looks at the back pack. 
RYAN Imagine for a second that you're carrying a backpack... I want you to feel the straps on your shoulders... You feel them? 
Ryan isn't feeling them. He is not inspired. He isn't believable. He's barely even there. 
RYAN Now, I want you to pack it with all the stuff you have in your life. Start with the little things. 
Ryan is trying, but he can't find the will to do this. 
RYAN The... um... The stuff in drawers and on shelves. 
Ryan takes a beat. He just stares at the backpack and thinks about all the things he has removed from it... And then... 
RYAN Excuse me. 
And with that, Ryan leaves the stage. Handlers try to figure out what Ryan is doing. The Host runs for the mic. 
GOALQUEST HOST (TO RYAN) What the fuck are you doing? (TO CROWD) Okay, everyone just relax. We'll have your next guest out in a sec. 
EXT. CONCOURSE, MCCARRAN INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY 
Ryan hustles past SLOT MACHINES until he is actually jogging. 
INT. BOARDING GATE, MCCARRAN INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY 
Ryan runs up to a gate. He's the last one to board. 
INT. BOEING 757 - NIGHT 
Over Ryan's shoulder, through the window, we see Chicago below as the flight begins its descent. 
INT. CORRIDOR OF LIGHT, CHICAGO O'HARE AIRPORT - NIGHT 
Ryan on the PEOPLE MOVER under the ceiling of NEON LIGHTS. Peaceful music emits from hidden speakers. Ryan walks briskly past idle riders. 
EXT. RENTAL CAR SATELLITE KIOSK, CHICAGO - NIGHT 
Ryan hurriedly signs a hand-held device, hops into a SEDAN and speeds off. The RENTAL CAR ASSISTANT suddenly realizes... 
RENTAL CAR ASSISTANT Hey, you forgot to give me your Devotion Club card! 
EXT. TOWNHOUSE, CHICAGO SUBURBS - NIGHT 
Ryan steps out of his rental car and approaches the door of the townhouse - checking the address against a piece of HILTON STATIONARY. 
Ryan stops, knocks, and puts on a smile. 
We hear Footsteps. The door unlocks and opens revealing ALEX. She's wearing sweatpants and glasses. She's at home. She looks different. 
RYAN Surprise. 
But there's something else. Alex is in shock... She's frozen. 
Something's wrong. Ryan's smile begins to melt. 
A man's voice calls from inside. 
MAN'S VOICE (O.C.) Honey, who's at the door? 
A couple kids run by through the background, giggling. A man chases after them. 
Alex is still speechless. Her eyes are angry and apologizing all at the same time. 
Ryan just stands there. Emotionally bleeding to death. 
Ryan sits doing nothing. Others around him play Sudoku, read trashy paperbacks, work on laptops. Ryan just stairs at the stitching on the seat in front of him. When... "Bing" 
PURSER Ladies and gentlemen, we have a special announcement to make. 
Passengers look up. 
PURSER (CONT'D) Our pilot has just informed me that we are passing over the city of Mesa... which might not mean much to most of you, but means a lot to one of our fliers today, because he just hit TEN... MILLION... MILES... 
RYAN Oh no... 
The Gershwin theme song for the airline rains down from the overhead speakers. Passengers clap. Flight attendants gather at Ryan's seat with big smiles and champagne. 
Ryan doesn't even react. He's just stunned. 
The flight attendants separate just enough for a man in a bomber jacket to squeeze through. It's Maynard Finch, the Chief Pilot from the commercial. 
MAYNARD FINCH (TO RYAN) That seat taken? 
Maynard gives a little salute to his flight attendants, then slides by Ryan to the window seat. 
MAYNARD FINCH You're the youngest yet to hit twenty mil. Don't know where you found the time... (REMEMBERS) Oh right, here you go. 
Maynard pulls out a MEMBERSHIP CARD. It's actually been stamped from platinum. 
MAYNARD FINCH (CONT'D) Seventh card we've made. Small club. We really appreciate your loyalty. 
It has a pair of wings around "Member Number 7". Ryan holds it between his fingertips... Catches his own reflection. 
RYAN You know how many times I've thought about this moment? Played out the conversation I'd have with you right here. 
MAYNARD FINCH Really? What did you want to say? 
A long beat. 
RYAN You know, I... I can't remember. 
MAYNARD FINCH That's alright. Happens to all of us. (attempts chit chat) So, where you from? 
Ryan looks at him straight in the face. 
RYAN I'm from here. 
INT. RYAN'S OFFICE, CTC - NEXT DAY 
Ryan picks up the phone at his desk. He removes his new TEN MILLION MILE CARD and dials a number off the back. 
AIRLINE OPERATOR Hello, Mr. Bingham. 
RYAN Oh, how did you know it was me? 
AIRLINE OPERATOR This is your dedicated line. We reserve them for our most loyal and dedicated fliers. 
RYAN Oh. I'd like to transfer some of my miles. Can you open up an account under Jim and Julie Miller? 
AIRLINE OPERATOR Certainly. How many miles would you like to transfer? 
RYAN How many miles would it take to circle the globe? 
AIRPORT OPERATOR We have our "around-the-world" tickets. They're five hundred thousand miles each. 
RYAN Sounds perfect. 
Craig enters Ryan's doorway. 
CRAIG GREGORY Got a second? 
RYAN (to the airline operator) I'm going to have to call you right back. 
Craig takes a seat across from Ryan. 
CRAIG GREGORY What happened to you yesterday? I was trying to reach you all day. 
RYAN I got tied up in... personal stuff. What's going on? 
An uncomfortable beat. 
CRAIG GREGORY Do you remember Karen Barnes? 
Ryan doesn't. 
CRAIG GREGORY (CONT'D) She was part of a thirty person reduction a few weeks back in Wichita. Natalie fired her. 
RYAN No, I fire dozens of people a day.

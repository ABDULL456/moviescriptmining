INT. WHEELER CAR - NIGHT. 
Frank drives. April stares ahead.    Their faces are lit by the dashboard. After a while... 
FRANK I mean it, baby. You were the only person in that play. 
APRIL Thank you. 
He looks over at her. 
FRANK We just never should've let you get mixed up in the damned thing. 
APRIL All right. 
FRANK You've studied for Christ's sake. 
APRIL Could we sort of stop talking about it now? 
FRANK Sure. I just don't want you feeling bad about it, that's all. Because it's not worth it. I mean, it's bad enough having to live out here among these damn people - what'd you say? 
APRIL I said yes. All right, Frank. Could you just stop talking now, before you drive me crazy, please? 
Frank clenches his jaw and flips on the indicator. 
APRIL (CONT'D) What are you doing? Why are we stopping? 
EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 
The car comes to a stop at the side of the road. 
INT. WHEELER CAR - NIGHT. 
Frank turns off the ignition.   He slides towards her. 
APRIL No, Frank, please don't... 
He puts his arms around her. 
FRANK Baby, it's okay... 
APRIL Please don't touch me. 
FRANK April... 
APRIL Why can't you...just... LEAVE ME ALONE! 
Frank slides back behind the wheel.    Beat. 
FRANK It strikes me, that there's a considerable amount of bullshit going on here.... And there's one or two things I'd like to clear up. Number one, it's not my fault the play was lousy. Number two, it's sure as hell not my fault you didn't turn out to be an actress, and the sooner you get over that little piece of soap opera the better off we'll both be. Number three, I don't happen to fit the role of dumb, insensitive suburban husband; you've been trying to hang that one on me ever since we moved here. Number four - 
She opens the door and is out of the car, flashing across the headlights. Frank struggles with his door. 
EXT. HIGHWAY SHOULDER - NIGHT. 
April stands in the dark 30 yards from the road looking over an expansive countryside. There's only a few lights in the distance. This is still farmland. 
Frank comes up behind her, careful to keep his distance. 
FRANK What the hell are you doing?     Come back to the car. 
APRIL No. Just let me stand here a second. 
Frank raises his arms in exasperation. A car approaches.    He puts a hand in his pocket and tries to look casual. The car's headlights light up April's back, then pass. 
FRANK April? 
She doesn't move. 
FRANK (CONT'D) Look, can't we sit in the car and talk about it, instead of running all over Route Twelve? 
INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - MORNING. 
An empty stairwell in Grand Central: a tide of grim, determined commuters rise into view. A mass of suits and hats. Frank is amongst them. 
EXT. MIDTOWN STREET - MORNING. 
Knox Headquarters -- a squat, formidable structure.   Thick HONKING traffic. Crowded sidewalks. 
Frank walks with the crowd past a display window: bright cardboard images of fashionable women grin and point their pencils at a list of product benefits - "SPEED, ACCURACY, CONTROL." 
Pride of place at the center of the display is a new Knox 500 Electronic Computer with a sign that reads: "Performs A Man's Lifetime of Work in Just 30 Minutes!" 
INT. KNOX BUILDING ELEVATOR - MORNING. 
Frank rides crushed against the wall in a crowded elevator. He glances over at - 
MAUREEN GRUBE, 23, ripe, a little obvious, but undeniably sexy.   She meets his look. And looks away. 
INT. KNOX 15TH FLOOR, FRANK'S CUBICLE - MORNING. 
Frank opens the bottom right drawer of his desk, props up his feet and lights a cigarette. 
JACK (O.S.) I'm going to need your help this morning, Old Scout. 
Seated beside Frank, JACK ORDWAY, 40's, tall and effete with greying hair, appears to be hard at work, hunched over a file. He is, in fact, propping up his head with his hand while shielding his eyes. 
JACK (CONT'D) For the next few hours, you're to warn me of Bandy's every approach and you may have to screen me from public view in the likely event I that I throw up. It's that bad. 
FRANK Good morning, Jack. 
JACK Nothing good about it, I assure you. 
EXT. WHEELER HOUSE - DAY. 
April drags two overflowing garbage cans to the curb. She stops and looks down the empty road. Not a single human being in sight. 
Close on April's face. 
INT. MRS. GIVINGS' CAR - DAY, 1948. FLASHBACK. 
Mrs. Givings sits behind the wheel, driving slowly along a suburban street talking at high speed. 
Frank sits beside her wearing sunglasses.    April sits in the back. 
We don't yet see what Mrs. Givings is describing, only as it plays on their faces. 
MRS. GIVINGS Of course, I knew the moment you came off the train what you were looking for... A small remodeled barn, or a carriage house ­ And I just hate to be the one to tell you that sort of thing just isn't available anymore... But I don't want you to despair. There is one place down here I want to show you... Now of course it isn't very desirable at this end. (gestures) As you see, Crawford Road is mostly these little cinder-blocky, pick-up trucky places ­ plumbers, carpenters, little local people of that sort. 
Frank turns around to April, lowers his glasses. April stifles a giggle. 
MRS. GIVINGS (CONT'D) But eventually... (she points, her arm fully extended) Eventually it leads up to Revolutionary Road, which is much nicer. Now, the place I want to show you, is a sweet little house and a sweet little setting. Simple, clean lines, good lawns, marvelous for children. It's right around this next curve... Now, you'll see it ­ there. 
They all look. 
MRS. GIVINGS (CONT'D) See the little white one? Sweet isn't it? The perky way it sits there on its little slope? Charming, isn't it? 
April smiles.    A smile full of promise. 
APRIL Oh, yes. 
INT. BANDY'S OFFICE - DAY. PRESENT. 
Frank's FIST raps against the door of an office... 
TED BANDY, 46, tight and precise, looks up from behind a well- organized desk. 
FRANK You wanted to see me? 
Bandy holds out an envelope from behind his desk. 
The waiter brings over the phone. Frank dials. He holds his finger to his lips. He uses an authoritative tone. 
FRANK Hello Mrs. Jorgensen. Frank Wheeler here. Just wanted to let you know that I've had to send Maureen Grube down to Visual Aides for me. I'll probably need her the rest of the day... Okay? Fine. You too. 
Frank hangs up and smiles at Maureen. 
MAUREEN I never even heard of Visual Aides. 
FRANK That's because it doesn't exist. 
Maureen smiles. 
INT. WHEELER HALLWAY - DAY. 
Now we're moving behind April as she moves through the silent house. She carries a basket of dirty laundry on her hip. She pulls the bedding off the couch. The distant SOUND of children playing. 
MRS. GIVINGS (O.S.) Yoo-hoo! 
She turns to see Mrs. Givings at the screen door. 
April manages a friendly smile. 
APRIL Hi Helen. 
MRS. GIVINGS I can't stay a minute... My, don't you look comfy! I just wanted to bring this sedum for that messy patch in the front yard. 
She puts it on the table. 
MRS. GIVINGS (CONT'D) All it wants is just a tiny dollop of water for the first few days, and you'll find it absolutely thrives. 
APRIL Well, thank you... You want some coffee? 
MRS. GIVINGS Only if you're having some. 
Helen sits down. With the end of her finger, she pushes a dirty dish out of her way. 
APRIL Is there something I can do for you, Helen? 
MRS. GIVINGS Oh... yes, I almost forgot. I do have a small favor I'd like to ask... (quiver of anxiety ) It's about my son, John. He's been in the hospital. 
APRIL I'm sorry to hear that. 
MRS. GIVINGS Well, actually, just for the present, he's in Pleasant Brook... Psychiatric. 
April's face.   She knows what it means. 
APRIL ...I'm so sorry. 
MRS. GIVINGS Oh... Nothing serious. He just got a little run down. Things can just get the better of us sometimes. Don't you think? 
APRIL Yes.    Of course. 
Mrs. Givings smiles. Then, pretending to read the titles on a stack of books on the table... 
MRS. GIVINGS It really is a marvellous facility and the treatments seem to be doing him wonders... Anyway, they said getting out for an afternoon might do him some good. 
She pauses on Sartre's `Nausea', looks at it vaguely. 
MRS. GIVINGS (CONT'D) I think he finds my friends a little conventional, frankly. I mean, he's travelled. He has a PhD in mathematics. I suppose you could say he's an intellectual. It would do him a world of good to meet a young couple like you. 
APRIL We'd love to Helen. 
MRS. GIVINGS So, I thought perhaps if you had some time... 
APRIL We'd love to. 
MRS. GIVINGS (flushed with relief) Thank you, dear... Thank you. 
April smiles generously. 
Frank laughs. 
FRANK Oh, right. 
APRIL Don't laugh -- listen a minute! Have you any idea what they pay for secretarial positions in the government agencies in Europe? Embassies and those things. 
Frank laughs again. 
FRANK No, I don't. 
APRIL I'm serious about this Frank. Do you think I'm kidding or something? 
FRANK No, I know, I know. I just have a couple of questions, is all. For one thing, do you mind telling me what exactly I'm supposed to be doing while you're out earning all this money? 
She draws back, shocked that he doesn't get it. 
APRIL Don't you see that's the whole idea? You'll be doing what you should've been allowed to do seven years ago. You'll have time, Frank. You'll have time to find out what it is that you actually want to do, and when you figure it out you'll have the time and the freedom to start doing it. 
FRANK Sweetheart, it's just not very realistic, is all. 
APRIL Well, I happen to think this is unrealistic. I think it's unrealistic for a man with a fine mind to go on working like a dog year after year at a job he can't stand, coming home to a place he can't stand, to a wife who's equally unable to stand the same things. 
Frank is silent.   How could anyone possibly argue with her? 
APRIL (CONT'D) You want to know the worst part? Our whole existence here is based on this great premise that we're somehow very special and superior to the whole thing, and you know what I've realized...? We're not! We're just like everyone else. Look at us!   We've bought into the same ridiculous delusion. This idea that you have to resign from life and settle down the moment you have children. And we've been punishing each other for it. 
FRANK Listen: we decided to move out here. No one ever forced me to take the job at Knox. (MORE) 
FRANK (CONT'D) I mean who ever said I was supposed to be a big deal, anyway? 
APRIL When I first met you, there was nothing in the world you couldn't do or be. 
FRANK I was a little wise guy with a big mouth, that's all. 
APRIL You were not! How can you even say that? 
FRANK ...All right... So, I'll have time. And God knows that's appealing. It's very appealing. And I mean, everything you say might make a certain amount of sense, if I had some definite talent maybe. If I were an artist or a writer. 
APRIL But Frank, listen to me: It's what you are that's being stifled here. It's what you are that's being denied and denied and denied in this kind of life. 
FRANK And what's that? 
APRIL Don't you know...? 
He looks at her.   She gazes back at him. 
APRIL (CONT'D) You're the most valuable and wonderful thing in the world... You're a man. 
Frank looks at her. In that moment, he loves her more than ever before. He kisses her. 
APRIL (CONT'D) This is our chance, Frank.   This is our one chance. 
Beat. 
FRANK Okay. 
APRIL Okay? 
FRANK Why not...? Why the hell not? 
April throws her arms around him. 
INT. KNOX 15TH FLOOR, ELEVATOR BAY - MORNING. 
DING. The elevator doors slide open.   Frank steps onto the fifteenth floor, full of energy. 
INT. KNOX 15TH FLOOR, FRANK'S CUBICLE - MORNING. 
Frank arrives at his desk.   Casually tosses his briefcase down. Lights a cigarette. 
FRANK (CONT'D) This one's on me. 
EXT GRAND CENTRAL STATION - AFTERNOON 
Frank is standing leaning against a coffee bar in Grand Central Station. He is finishing a beer. 
It is rush hour, and amidst the sea of people, he is the only one not moving. 
He is watching all the people walking by with an air of detached amusement. As if he were now above them all. 
EXT. SPACE BETWEEN TRAIN CARS - AFTERNOON. 
Frank rides between train cars. The wind whips his hair. He takes a deep pull from a pinched cigarette - then flicks it straight as a bullet into the passing countryside. 
He feels alive. 
EXT. REVOLUTIONARY ROAD TRAIN STATION - AFTERNOON. 
The commuter train slows into the station. A door swings open. And Frank leaps from the still moving train onto the platform. He slows to a walk. 
EXT. WHEELER HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON. 
The kids dance back and forth through the sprinkler, shrieking with pleasure. 
April sits on the steps in front of the house reading some material from the American Express office. 
She looks up as Frank's car pulls into the drive. He steps out of the car and comes towards her. She looks up and smiles. He drops his brief case on the ground and walks towards her. She meets him in the middle of the lawn, and they embrace. 
INT. FRANK AND APRIL'S BEDROOM - EVENING. 
CLOSE UP - two fingers walk the journey from New York to Paris across the page of an atlas. 
Michael and Jennifer, dressed for bed, sit sandwiched between April and Frank under the bedclothes. 
APRIL ...All the way to... here. 
A pause as the two kids stare at the Atlas. 
JENNIFER But why? 
APRIL Well, sweetheart. It's a big world out there and we thought maybe we should go see a little bit of it. 
MICHAEL How far is it? 
APRIL A long way. We have to take a boat ride over the sea to get there. 
JENNIFER I won't know anyone there. 
APRIL I know. And neither will I. But remember when you started school? And now look how many friends you have... 
Frank senses that they are a little concerned.   April and Frank look to one another. 
FRANK You'll never guess what they eat in Paris. You'll never guess... 
JENNIFER What? 
FRANK Snails. 
JENNIFER/MICHAEL Snails?! 
APRIL And frog's legs! 
The children dissolve into disgusted laughter.    April and Frank laugh with them. 
INT. CAMPBELL FRONT HALLWAY - LATE AFTERNOON. 
At the bottom of the stairs, Shep hums a big band number as he vigorously shines his shoes. 
SHEP Buddappa banh!     Banh!   Banh! 
Overlapping: 
MILLY What? 
SHEP When? 
MILLY Why? 
FRANK September. 
Beat.   Then: 
MILLY But what for? 
FRANK What for? Because we've always wanted to. Because the kids are still young. Because it's beautiful. Shep, you tell her. 
SHEP ...It's a great city. 
Milly glances nervously at Shep. 
MILLY When did you make this decision? 
APRIL Oh... about a week ago... its hard to remember. We just suddenly decided to go, that's all. 
MILLY About a week ago, and you tell us now! 
APRIL We had to get used to the idea. 
Shep forces himself across the room and hands the Wheelers their drinks. 
SHEP So, what's the deal, Frank? You get a job over there, or what? 
FRANK (smiles) No. Not exactly. 
SHEP What do you mean, `not exactly?' 
APRIL Frank won't be doing any kind of a job, because I will. 
SHEP (to Frank) And what are you going to do? 
FRANK I'm going to study... and I'm going to read and... I suppose I'm going to finally figure out what I want to do with my life. 
SHEP ...While she supports you? 
Beat. 
FRANK Yes. While she supports me...   At least in the beginning. 
APRIL You wouldn't believe what they pay for secretarial work in government agencies over there. NATO and E.C.A. and those places. 
FRANK The cost of living is dirt cheap compared to here, so we should be all right. 
Beat. 
APRIL The truth is we just need something different. (MORE) 
APRIL (CONT'D) We're not getting any younger and we don't want life to just pass us by. 
MILLY Gee, it sounds wonderful, kids. I mean it; it really sounds wonderful. We'll certainly miss you, though - won't we, sweetie? Golly. 
SHEP Sure. 
MILLY Paris.   Wow. 
A   silence.   Shep's face. 
INT. MILLY AND SHEP'S BEDROOM - NIGHT. 
Milly sits on the edge of the bed in her night gown.   She is brushing her hair. 
VINCE He's in Bandy's office. 
FRANK (unimpressed) Yeah? 
A small signal light illuminates on Frank's desk. 
ED Looks like he wants to talk to you. 
Frank looks around. They're all looking at him.     He looks over in the direction of Bandy's office. 
JACK Hey.   Keep my name out of it. 
INT. KNOX 15TH FLOOR, BANDY'S OFFICE - DAY 
Bandy looks up from his desk.   An uncharacteristic smile. 
BANDY (warm) Frank. How are you? You know Bart Pollock? 
FRANK Well, we've never met, but - 
A massive MAN in tan gaberdine rises up from a chair. 
BART POLLOCK Glad to know you Frank. 
He holds a file in his enormous hand. 
BART POLLOCK (CONT'D) Speaking of production control? 
Frank looks away, ready for a dressing down. 
BART POLLOCK (CONT'D) Frank... This is a crackerjack. They're just tickled to death in Toledo. 
He slaps the file on the desk.    Frank can't believe it. 
INT. WHEELER LIVING ROOM - DAY. 
Close of a book: "Brighter French." 
Frank sits on the couch, flipping absently. 
FRANK You wouldn't have believed this guy. 
April enters carrying a plate of sandwiches. 
FRANK (CONT'D) He's perfect Presidential material in the worst sense. A million dollar smile and about three pounds of muscle between his ears. (mimicking Pollock's booming voice) "Frank, this is a crackerjack." 
April looks around to be sure everything's in place. 
APRIL Wish I saw his face when you told him you were leaving. 
Frank looks away. 
FRANK ...Horse's ass. 
TOOT of a car horn.   April goes to the window. 
APRIL I think this is them. 
INT./EXT. WHEELER HOUSE - DAY. 
Through the picture window, we see the Givings' car is parked in the driveway. 
Mrs. Givings gets out of the car holding a tinfoil covered baking pan. Mr. Givings opens the backseat. 
Out steps JOHN, 30's, an institutional haircut and ill- fitting suit. He looks around the sunny neighborhood. 
INT. WHEELER KITCHEN - DAY. 
The kitchen is suddenly crowded with the Givings, Frank and April. 
JOHN (CONT'D) (suddenly serious) But, hey... Listen, though. You got a high-ball glass...? Put a couple-three ice cubes in it, pour it up to the brim. That's the way I like it. 
FRANK I think I can do that. 
Mr. Givings eats his sandwich, watching his son. 
MRS. GIVINGS Oh, this is the most wonderful egg salad, April. You must tell me how you fix it. 
Frank hands John his high-ball glass. 
JOHN You a lawyer Frank? 
FRANK No, I'm not. 
JOHN I could use a lawyer. 
MR. GIVINGS John, let's not get started again about the lawyer. 
JOHN Pop, couldn't you just sit there and eat your wonderful egg salad, and quit horning in? 
Mr. Givings gives his son a level, warning look. 
JOHN (CONT'D) See, I've got a good many questions to ask and I'm willing to pay for the answers... Now, I don't need to be told that a man who goes after his mother with a coffee table is putting himself in a weak position legally; that's obvious. 
Frank and April exchange a look. 
MRS. GIVINGS John, come and have a look out this fabulous picture window. 
Mrs. Givings gets up and goes to the window. 
JOHN If he hits her with it and kills her, that's a criminal case. 
MRS. GIVINGS Oh, look, the sun's coming out! 
JOHN If all he does is break the coffee table and give her a certain amount of aggravation and she decides to go to court over it, that's a civil case. 
MRS. GIVINGS Maybe we'll see a rainbow!   John, come have a look. 
JOHN Ma, how about doing everybody a favor? How about shutting up! 
April's face.   She's not smiling now. 
MR. GIVINGS Steady down, now. 
With her back to the room, Mrs. Givings closes her eyes. 
FRANK I can look into it.   Maybe recommend someone. 
John stares at Frank for any sign of condescension. 
JOHN So, what do you do, Frank? 
FRANK I work for Knox Business Machines. 
JOHN You design the machines? 
FRANK Nope. 
JOHN Make `em, sell `em, repair `em? 
MRS. GIVINGS All these questions. 
FRANK I sort of help sell them, I guess. I work in the office. Actually, it's sort of a stupid job. I mean there's nothing ­ you know, interesting about it or anything. 
MRS. GIVINGS Oh, Frank... 
JOHN Whaddya do it for then? 
MR. GIVINGS Maybe Frank doesn't want to be questioned like this, son. 
John stares at April.    He smiles. 
JOHN I like your girl, Frank. 
FRANK Me too. 
JOHN So, what do a couple of people like you have to run away from? 
FRANK We're not running. 
John comes to a stop. 
JOHN And what's in Paris? 
APRIL A different way of life. 
FRANK So maybe we are running... We're running from the hopeless emptiness of the whole life here. 
JOHN The hopeless emptiness? Now, you've said it. Plenty of people are on to the emptiness, but it takes real guts to see the hopelessness... Wow. 
John continues walking.   Frank and April watch him go. 
INT. WHEELER LIVING ROOM - DUSK. 
Frank and April at the kitchen table. 
APRIL You know, he's the first person who seemed to know what we were talking about. 
FRANK That's true. Maybe we are just as crazy as he is. 
APRIL If being crazy means living life as if it matters then I don't care if we are completely insane. (beat) Do you? 
FRANK No. 
APRIL I love you so much. 
EXT. WHEELER HOUSE - DAY 
The small, attractive house bathed in sunlight. 
INT. MIDTOWN HOTEL RESTAURANT - AFTERNOON. 
Frank follows Bart Pollock as he cuts a swathe through an impressive midtown eatery. A small MAITRE D' scuttles in front of them. Bart nods, points at well-wishers, and makes a politician's show of knowing the staff. 
BART POLLOCK Tell you something, Frank. I'm a little sore at Bandy for the way he's kept you under a bushel all these years. This place okay, for you? 
Frank smirks at the performance. 
FRANK This is just fine, sir.   Fine. 
INT. MIDTOWN HOTEL RESTAURANT - LATER. 
Bart Pollock sits across an expanse of white tablecloth gripping a martini glass in one of his enormous paws. 
BART POLLOCK One thing interests me, Frank, and one thing only: selling the electronic computer to the American businessman... 
BART POLLOCK (CONT'D) That's why I'm assembling a team. Men like you, not your average salesmen... It'll mean more money, and I got to be honest, maybe more of a time commitment. But you'll be part of something exciting, Wheeler... Computers. 
FRANK Well, sir, it sounds exciting. 
BART POLLOCK Bart! 
FRANK Bart... 
Frank looks down at his plate.   He can't help himself. 
FRANK (CONT'D) Do you happen to remember an Earl Wheeler? 
Bart looks at him blankly. 
MAUREEN (CONT'D) maybe I should buy you a drink or something? You know...? Celebrate. 
Frank's face.   We don't know which way he'll go.   He smiles. 
FRANK Yeah.   Maybe. 
She smiles.   She can't quite believe it. 
MAUREEN I'll just get my coat. 
Frank sits there a moment longer, thinking.    Then he follows. 
INT. WHEELER FAMILY ROOM - DAY. 
On a television. Elmer Fudd points a gun at Bugs Bunny, and pulls the trigger. 
Frank frowns into his French phrase book.   Mike is watching the TV. 
April works a sewing machine with a cigarette burning beside her. Jennifer stands beside her holding a stuffed Giraffe and a list, which she reads. 
JENNIFER I'm going to take my doll carriage and my bear and my three Easter rabbits and my giraffe and all my dolls and my doll house. 
APRIL I thought maybe we'd give the doll house to Madeline. 
JENNIFER No! I don't want to give it to Madeline. 
April has to stop to re-thread and she's losing patience. 
APRIL I already explained to you, the big things are going to be hard to pack. 
Frank lowers the book.   He recognizes her tone. 
JENNIFER But Madeline can have my bear and my Easter rabbits - 
APRIL No! Just the big things. Look. Wouldn't you rather go outside and play with Michael. 
JENNIFER I don't feel like it. 
APRIL You've been inside all day. 
JENNIFER I don't feel like it! 
APRIL Well, I don't feel like explaining everything fifteen times to somebody who's too bored and silly to listen! 
Jennifer turns and runs up the stairs, upset. 
April lets out a defeated sigh. She turns to the kitchen to see to the supper. Steam rises from the vegetables. 
Frank stands in the entrance silently watching for a moment. 
FRANK What's the matter? 
APRIL Nothing. 
She carries a pot of steaming, overcooked vegetables to the sink, slops them into a colander. 
FRANK I don't believe you. Did something happen today or what? 
APRIL Nothing happened today that I haven't known about for days and days. 
FRANK What? 
APRIL Oh God, Frank, please don't look so dense. Do you mean you haven't guessed or anything? 
FRANK What are you talking about? 
She finally stops and looks at him. 
APRIL I'm pregnant, that's all. 
FRANK April, you just said our daughter was mistake. How do I know you didn't try to get rid of her, or Michael for that matter? How do I know you didn't try to flush our entire fucking family down the toilet? 
APRIL No that's not true. Of course I didn't. 
FRANK But how do I know April? 
APRIL Stop.   Please just stop, Frank. 
FRANK April, a normal woman, a normal sane mother doesn't buy herself a piece of rubber tubing to give herself an abortion so she can, go live out some God damn fantasy. 
April's face. 
FRANK (CONT'D) (sober) All I'm saying is you don't seem entirely rational about this thing... And maybe we should get someone to help you think about it. 
APRIL ...And the new job's going to pay for that too? 
FRANK April if you need a shrink, it'll be paid for. Obviously. 
April turns to the book shelves.   Her back to him. 
Frank waits, his heart beating quickly. 
APRIL ...Okay. I guess there isn't much more to say, then, is there? 
Her eyes are bright with tears. 
APRIL (CONT'D) So I guess Paris was a pretty childish idea, huh? 
Everything hangs on Frank's answer... 
FRANK I guess maybe it was. 
April closes her eyes. Tears run down her cheeks.   He walks over to her, but he doesn't touch her. 
FRANK (CONT'D) We can be happy here April...   I can make you happy here. 
She cries quietly. 
FRANK (CONT'D) We've had a great few months.   It doesn't have to end... 
She turns to face him. 
FRANK (CONT'D) We're going to be okay. 
APRIL I hope so Frank.   I really hope so. 
INT. WHEELER LIVING ROOM - MORNING. 
Frank stands at the picture window watching... 
April approach the children. She squats on the ground so she can be at their height and talks to them. Michael tries to get into her arms. Jennifer turns away and walks sulkily across the grass. 
Frank looks into his coffee cup.   He doesn't look like a man who won an argument. 
INT. KNOX WAITING ROOM - DAY. 
Frank sits smoking nervously in an oak-paneled waiting room. The door opens behind him. He gets to his feet. 
RECEPTIONIST Thank you for waiting.   Mr. Pollock can see you now. 
He follows her through the door.    The door closes behind her. 
We see the scene in dumb-show through the glass door. Bart looks up as Frank enters. An "I knew it all along" smile spreads across Pollock's face. He offers his hand to Frank. Frank smiles thinly. They shake. 
JACK (O.S) Foiled by faulty contraception. 
INT. MIDTOWN RESTAURANT - DAY. 
Frank, Ed, Vince and Jack sit in the same booth in the same crowded luncheonette. 
MILLY (CONT'D) (tipsy) Guess April's pretty blue `bout Paris, huh? 
FRANK Think she'll be okay? 
MILLY Oh, sure. Give us girls a couple of days and we can get over anything! 
Frank turns his attention to Milly. He's a good dancer. His movements are fast and aggressive, his mind on April. 
Milly is a little too drunk, and hurries to keep up, perspiring through her dress. He spins her around and around, back and forth into his arms. Milly begins to look slightly dizzy. 
MILLY (CONT'D) ...Frank. 
He doesn't hear her over the music, or he doesn't care. 
MILLY (CONT'D) Frank... I... 
FRANK (sudden remorse) You okay? 
MILLY Gee...I'm afraid I'm not very... 
Her body spasms with the need to be sick. She turns and rushes for the lady's room. 
EXT. VITO'S LOG CABIN - NIGHT. 
Frank leads the way through the cars. 
Shep supports Milly who is now falling down drunk. 
April walks alone a few paces behind... 
They reach Shep's car, which is trapped behind several other cars. 
SHEP Of all the inconsiderate... 
A beat.   Frank looks to April. 
APRIL Look - why don't you take Milly home, then go home yourself and that would take care of both sitters. Then Shep can take me home later. 
SHEP All right with me. 
FRANK (to April) You'll be alright? 
APRIL Sure. 
Frank holds April's look an instant, then walks away with car keys in hand. 
INT. VITO'S LOG CABIN - NIGHT. 
Steve Kovack performs an exhausting, sweat-drenched drum solo. 
April and Shep now sit alone in the booth. 
SHEP I'm sorry you're not going away anymore. I know it was important to you. 
April distantly nods her thanks. 
SHEP (CONT'D) Don't take this wrong; I've been there and...they don't have so much we don't have here. 
APRIL It didn't have to be Paris. 
Shep sips his beer, trying to figure out how to connect with her... 
SHEP You just wanted out, huh? 
APRIL I wanted in. I just wanted us to live again. 
Shep nods, not entirely sure what she means. 
APRIL (CONT'D) For years I thought we shared a secret...that we would be wonderful in the world. I didn't exactly know how, but just the possibility...kept me hoping. 
He walks over to her.   He takes her in his arms.   She stiffens. 
FRANK Look, this has been kind of a crazy summer. We've both been under a strain. I mean I know you're upset. 
APRIL You know I'm not sleeping with you and you want to know why? 
She looks him straight in the eye. 
APRIL (CONT'D) Well, I'm sorry Frank, but I don't really feel like talking about it. 
She pulls herself free of his grasp. He watches as she adds the vegetables in the pot on the stove. 
FRANK Okay. What do you feel like talking about? 
APRIL Would it be all right if we didn't talk about anything? Can't we just take each day as it comes, and do the best we can, and not feel we have to talk about everything all the time? 
He smiles patiently. 
FRANK I don't think I suggested we talk about everything all the time. My point was, we've both been under a strain and we ought to be trying to help each other as much as we can right now. 
She's utterly uninterested and it's making him nervous. 
FRANK (CONT'D) I mean God knows my own behavior has been pretty weird lately... I mean, as it happens... there is actually something I'd like to tell you about... 
She continues folding the napkins. 
FRANK (CONT'D) I've been with a girl in the city a few times. 
Finally, she stops moving.   She looks at him. 
FRANK (CONT'D) A girl I hardly even know. It was nothing to me, but she got a little carried away. She's just a kid... Anyway, it's over now. It's really over. If I weren't sure of that I guess I could never have told you about it. 
APRIL Why did you? 
FRANK (relieved) Baby, I don't know. I think it was a simple case of wanting to be a man again after all that abortion business. Some kind of neurotic, irrational need to prove something. 
APRIL No. I don't mean why did you have the girl; I mean why did you tell me about it? 
He is suddenly unsure. 
APRIL (CONT'D) I mean what's the point? Is it supposed to make me jealous, or something? Is it supposed to make me fall in love with you, or back into bed with you, or what? I mean what am I supposed to say? 
He tries that same patient smile, but it's not convincing. 
FRANK Why don't you say what you feel? 
APRIL I don't feel anything. 
FRANK In other words you don't care what I do or who I fuck or anything? 
APRIL No; I guess that's right; I don't. 
She is frighteningly calm. 
APRIL (CONT'D) Fuck who you like. 
His panic mounts. 
FRANK Don't you see...Don't you see, I want you to care. 
APRIL Oh, I know you do. And I suppose I would if I loved you. But you see I don't think I do anymore. And I only just figured that out. And that's why I'd just as soon not do any talking right now. 
She goes back into the kitchen. Frank follows her. 
FRANK Oh, now don't give me this shit! You know God damn well you love me! 
APRIL You think so?! 
FRANK You know GOD DAMN WELL! 
John holds up his hand. 
JOHN What happened, Frank? You get cold feet, or what? You decide you're better off here after all? You figure it's more comfy here in the old Hopeless Emptiness after all, or -- 
Frank's face. 
JOHN (CONT'D) Wow, that did it! Look at his face! What's the matter, Wheeler? Am I getting warm? 
Frank stares at John, his rage increasing.   Mr. Givings gets to his feet. 
MR. GIVINGS (CONT'D) All right, son. I think we'd better be -- 
JOHN Boy! 
He lets out his braying laugh.   April starts to laugh. 
JOHN (CONT'D) Boy! You know something? I wouldn't be surprised if you knocked her up on purpose just so you could spend the rest of your life hiding behind that maternity dress. That way you never have to find out what he's made of. 
FRANK Now look, I think that's just about enough out of you. I mean, who the hell do you think you are? You come in here and say whatever crazy God damn thing comes into your head and I think it's about time someone told you to keep your God damn - 
MRS. GIVINGS He's not well, Frank. 
FRANK Not well, my ass! I don't give a damn if he's sick or well or dead or alive, he should keep his fucking opinions in the fucking insane asylum where they belong! 
April stares at Frank. 
MR. GIVINGS Let's go, son. 
Mr. Givings moves John towards the door. Mrs. Givings slowly stands. April is the only one left seated. 
JOHN Big man you got there, April. 
He winks at April and puts his hat on. 
JOHN (CONT'D) Big family man, solid citizen. I feel sorry for you. Still, maybe you deserve each other. 
April's face. 
JOHN (CONT'D) Matter of fact, the way you look right now, I'm beginning to feel sorry for him, too. I mean, you must give him a pretty bad time, if making babies is the only way he can prove he's got a pair of balls. 
FRANK You... fucking..! 
Frank lunges at John. Mr. Givings tries to hold Frank back. Mrs. Givings leaps between them. She's crying. 
MRS. GIVINGS He's not well, Frank! 
Silence.   Mr. Givings slowly releases Frank.   He is breathing heavily. 
MR. GIVINGS All right, John. Let's get on out to the car now. 
He guides him from the room. 
MRS. GIVINGS I'm sorry April, I'm so sorry... 
JOHN Right... Sorry, sorry, sorry! Okay Ma? Have I said `Sorry' enough times? I am sorry, too. Damn; I bet I'm just about the sorriest bastard I know. Course, get right down to it, I don't have a whole hell of a lot to be glad about, do I? 
He takes another step towards the door, then stops and turns back, laughing again. 
JOHN (CONT'D) Hey, but I'm glad about one thing, though. 
He points a yellow-stained finger at April's stomach. 
JOHN (CONT'D) You know what I'm glad about? I'm glad I'm not gonna be that kid. 
They go out. 
Frank goes to the liquor cabinet, pours a whiskey and drinks it. 
April watches him from across the room. 
Frank enters the bedroom and slams the door. 
He paces, slowly calming. 
He sits on the bed with his head in his hands... His mind racing. Then he's on his feet again. He rushes for the door. 
INT. WHEELER KITCHEN - EVENING. 
Frank enters, running, but the kitchen is empty.   Frank runs out of the room into living room. 
INT. WHEELER LIVING ROOM - EVENING 
The living room is empty.   He goes straight for the front door. 
EXT. WHEELER HOUSE - EVENING. 
Frank bursts out the front and comes to a stop. 
She's across the street - climbing unsteadily into the woods... 
Frank breaks into a sprint. 
EXT. WOODS - EVENING. 
April walks through the woods. 
Frank runs up behind her, scrambling through the muddy bracken. 
April wheels around. 
APRIL Don't come any closer. 
FRANK April, listen, I -- 
APRIL Don't come any closer. Can't I even get away from you in the fucking woods? 
He stops moving. 
FRANK April, listen, I didn't mean that. Honestly; I didn't mean what I said. 
APRIL Are you still talking? Isn't there any way to stop your talking? I NEED to think. Can't you see that? 
She backs up against a tree trunk, looking down at him. 
FRANK Please come back.     What're you doing out here? 
APRIL Do you want me to scream again, Frank? Because I will, if you say another word! I mean it! 
Frank has no choice - they're outside. The neighbors would hear and call the police. He reluctantly backs away, then turns back the way he came, glancing over his shoulder as he goes. 
INT. WHEELER FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT. 
Frank stands at the window watching the section of woods where he left April. 
Then, he sees her come back across the street. She walks around the side of the house. He turns and runs into the kitchen. 
INT. WHEELER KITCHEN - NIGHT. 
Frank goes to the window. He watches April walk up into the yard and stop against a tree. 
Frank pours a drink and takes the bottle with him to the window. He looks out, drinking. 
In the darkness, he can make out the glow of April's cigarette deep in the woods. 
INT. FRANK AND APRIL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT, LATER. 
Frank falls back on the bed. 
He's now very drunk. 
He stands.    April stands up too, smoothing her skirt. 
FRANK (CONT'D) Listen, though, April; this was really nice... I mean it was a swell breakfast. Really; I don't know when I've ever had a -- a nicer breakfast. 
APRIL Thank you... I'm glad; I enjoyed it too. 
They stand there gazing at one another across the table. Suddenly, inexplicably, his eyes are filled with tears. 
He turns and walks to the door. He puts his hand on the handle and turns back once more. 
FRANK Then you don't -- You don't hate me, or anything? 
APRIL No; of course I don't. 
She comes over to him. 
APRIL (CONT'D) Have a good day. 
He leans down and kisses her tenderly.   They look at one another a moment longer. 
FRANK Okay, then... So long. 
He steps through the door. She catches the door before it shuts and watches him through the screen. 
EXT. WHEELER DRIVEWAY - MORNING. 
April walks out onto the driveway as the car reverses away down the drive. 
INT. WHEELER CAR - MORNING. 
Frank backs the car onto the road. He slides the car into drive and then catches sight of April in the driveway. 
EXT. WHEELER DRIVEWAY - MORNING. 
April sees Frank looking back at her.    She waves.   Frank waves from the car and drives off... 
Then April is alone. She shivers from the morning chill. She turns and looks back at the house. 
INT. WHEELER KITCHEN - MORNING. 
April enters through the screen door and goes to the table. She looks down at Frank's diagram and carefully places it aside. 
She carries the dishes to the sink and begins to wash them. 
Suddenly, her body convulses as she tries to hold back from crying. And then there is no stopping the tears... 
INT. WHEELER HALLWAY - MORNING. 
April is standing by the phone, with her hand on the receiver, rehearsing. She is smoking. She dials. 
APRIL Hello... Milly? Everything all right? My voice sounds what...? 
April uses both hands to grip the receiver. 
APRIL (CONT'D) Well, no, I'm afraid I'm not feeling any better... If it's not an inconvenience for you... This evening would be great. What...? Oh, well- no, not if they're outdoors playing. Don't call them in. 
The cigarette shreds in April's hand. 
APRIL (CONT'D) Just give them - you know, give them each a kiss for me, and give them my love, and tell them - you know... All right, Milly. Thanks. 
She hangs up and begins to cry again.   Takes a breath. 
INT. WHEELER HALLWAY - MORNING. 
FOOTSTEPS... 
We move behind April as she walks through the silent house. 
The distant SOUND of children playing outside. 
FRANK My God. 
SHEP Here, have a cigarette. 
Shep offers the pack.   Frank doesn't take one. 
FRANK She did it to herself, Shep. 
Shep's face as he realizes what he's saying. 
FRANK (CONT'D) She did it to herself. 
Shep takes a cigarette for himself.   He lights it with trembling fingers. 
SHEP I'll get some coffee. 
Frank looks over at Shep as if he'd forgotten him.   He nods. 
Shep stands and walks down the hall. 
INT. HOSPITAL - COFFEE MACHINE - AFTERNOON. 
Shep stands at a coffee machine, gathering himself. He looks up. He begins to feed coins into the machine. His hands are trembling. He drops a coin. It rolls under the machine. He has to get down on his hands and knees to retrieve it... 
INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - AFTERNOON. 
Shep walks tentatively, holding a cup in each hand, slopping coffee onto the floor... 
He rounds the corner and stops. 
Frank is no longer in his chair at the end of the long echoing hallway. Shep looks around... 
Then suddenly, the double doors are flung open and a number of nurses hurry out. Behind them, comes Frank, supported by two Doctors. 
Shep runs to them as they move Frank over to a chair.    He's in shock. 
FRANK No.   No.   No. 
They try to make him sit, but he stays stubbornly on his feet, the chair skidding behind him. 
DOCTOR Try to sit down, Mr. Wheeler. 
SHEP Sit down Frank. 
Frank looks at Shep - his face is a terrifying blank. 
EXT. REVOLUTIONARY ROAD - MAGIC HOUR. 
A toyland of white and pastel houses along the road. The crisp green lawns. The blue televisions flickering behind the glass. 
We hear the WHISK of running footsteps on the asphalt, the rush of a man's breath... 
Frank is running down the middle of the street, tears streaming silently down his face... 
INT. CAMPBELL LIVING ROOM - EVENING, ONE YEAR LATER. 
Four high-ball glasses with glistening cubes of ice. 
Shep puts the finishing touches on four drinks. 
MR. and MRS. BRACE, a pleasant looking young couple fresh from the city sit on the couch. 
MILLY ...It was the worst experience of my life. Such wonderful people. Weren't they Shep? Poor April. 
Shep picks up the drinks and carries them across the room. He stands there beside the three of them, but he can't bring himself to sit down and join in. 
MILLY (CONT'D) Frank lives in the city now.       Where is it he works? 
SHEP Bart Pollock Associates.

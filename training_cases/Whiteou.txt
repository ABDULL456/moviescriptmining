SCROLL OVER BLACK: 
Antarctica. Six million square miles of ice.    The coldest place on earth. 
Forty-six countries have competing claims and maintain outposts. The Antarctic Treaty holds these claims in check. 
There is no regular law enforcement. A single U.S. Marshal is assigned to the territory. 
END SCROLL 
EXT.   ANTARCTICA - DAY 
Snow-covered hills thrust up out of a barren, white wasteland. No buildings, no animals... nothing. 
CLOSER: The hills are more defined. Rows of jagged peaks and a crazed pattern of crevasses. A fine `mist' of wind-blown snow whips about this jumble of glinting ice. 
STILL CLOSER: We track down through valleys, skirt crevasses, climb peaks and finally pause on a flat stretch of ice. HOLD on this scene of timeless, savage beauty, then... 
THUD!!! 
A FACE, hooded and goggled in ECW (extreme cold weather gear) drops into frame, smashing down on the icy surface with such brutal impact, the shattered goggle shield pops out -- 
-- EYES STARE BLANKLY into camera -- locked in death. It's a man. 
Camera slowly starts to PULL BACK to see his limbs have snapped at unnatural angles, the head grotesquely twisted -- bright red arterial blood seeps from the corpse and spreads out down tiny cracks in the ice until, with startling speed, it turns dark and freezes. 
We PULL BACK further and look down on the body, a bizarre shape in a spider's web of frozen blood. And SLOWLY WE PULL BACK... further and further...until all is dazzling white.

CONTINUED: 
The sounds of lapping surf and distant seagulls serenades us like a rhythmic lullaby. 
-- CU on WOMAN'S TOES digging up soft, white sand.    The shadow of a palm tree cascading over top. 
Widen slightly -- a pair of feminine hands, donning an ANTIQUE SILVER ring on the left middle finger, are slowly applying coconut tanning lotion onto firm, athletic calves. Deep. Soothing. Then -- 
O.C. KNOCK KNOCK on a door. 
The hands stop. 
Another KNOCK KNOCK. 
The lapping surf and seagull sounds come to an abrupt halt. 
WOMAN (O.C.) (slightly annoyed) ...Yeah? 
Widen to meet CARRIE STETKO, late 20's. Cargo pants -- rolled up, and an exercise top. She's kicking back, but she's not at the beach. 
In fact, she's in an office, sitting on a chair. A NEWLY OPEN BAG OF KITTY LITTER sits next to a plastic tub she's got her feet in. Two FLOOR LAMPS stand like sentinels above her, blasting her with warm wattage. A fake palm tree casts the shadow across her body. She's pulled the earplugs out of her iPod -- back to the real world. 
The door opens. Leaning into the room is JAMIE CLARK (20's), African-American. She's dressed in a flannel shirt, jeans. Carrie doesn't look entirely happy at the intrusion. 
JAMIE Sorry, a Professor Sapperstein needs to see you in biology. Said it's urgent. 
CARRIE Alright -- 
Jamie leaves. 
As Carrie gets to her feet, camera moves away from her, panning around the small office. Half-packed up boxes lay strewn about the floor. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
A CALENDER hangs crookedly before a desk. Each day has been marked off with a large X. THREE DAYS REMAIN unmarked. Last space reads: WINTER-OVER, and in the space next to it, there's a cut out picture of a tropical beach. 
A dart board is next to it with A PHOTOGRAPH pulverized with dart holes over the Bullseye. It's of a candy- striped pole topped with a silver ball, surrounded by international flags - the South Pole. Carrie is standing next to the pole, smiling at the camera, arm-in-arm with SAM MURPHY (30's). Looks like he's handsome, but his face is a little more obliterated than the rest of him. 
CUT TO: 
He actually ponders the question for a moment. Carrie puts an arm around his bony shoulder and steers him away from the others. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) 
CARRIE (cont'd) Professor...are you planning on doing the winter-over? 
SAPPERSTEIN Not this year, no. 
CARRIE Good. And how are you feeling right now? 
SAPPERSTEIN You think I'm crazy? Is that what you're saying? 
CARRIE (PACIFYING) No, no, not crazy. But this time of year, down here, we're all going a little toasty aren't we? How about you plant a little Cannabis when you get home? 
She pats him on the back. 
INT.   MARSHAL'S OFFICE - MCMURDO - DAY 
Carrie enters. Walks by a mirror. Takes a glance. Is about to fix her hair, then stares at the reflection -- what's the point? We notice a slight scar on her right temple. 
She steps around the moving boxes to her desk, which is bare except for a thick BINDER labelled,`DAILY REPORTS'. 
She takes a seat, opens a binder and flips past dozens of empty pages reading "INCIDENT: None. ACTION TAKEN: None." On today's page she fills in the blanks with "Theft of botany sample." And "None." 
A pencil falls down onto the desk before her. Bounces. Then rolls off. She doesn't even flinch, or look up. Just stares unhappily at the binder. 
Camera tilts up -- several pencils are stuck into the cardboard tiles. 
She closes the binder and puts it on the shelf beside a row of framed photos: Carrie in a Marshal's uniform graduation day; crisp, clean uniform. She and two other girlfriends, all smiles, at a bar -- she's got a birthday cake in front of her. Carrie on a beach somewhere, sitting in a chair, feet in the sand -- shaded by a palm. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
As she lifts the frames and moves to pack them in a nearby box -- 
MURPHY (O.C.) You busy? 
She turns to see SAM MURPHY, base commander, the guy on the DART BOARD. There's an awkward beat. 
CARRIE What do you think? (BEAT) I know you weren't in the area. What's up? 
He sees the photo on the dart board -- saunters over to it. 
MURPHY I got a pilot at ASB who thinks he spotted a popsicle out on the ice. 
CARRIE What flavor? 
MURPHY Don't know. 
CARRIE And we were doing so well. (BEAT) Where? 
MURPHY McClain Valley. 
This throws her. 
CARRIE McClain Valley? What was he doing out there? That's no man's land. 
He takes a closer look at the photo -- almost seems amused. 
MURPHY I've got a plane heading to ASB in an hour with some supplies for Winter-over. (BEAT) Can't get you back until tomorrow. 
He looks at her with a smile -- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
MURPHY (cont'd) You leaving the dart board? 
CARRIE No -- just the picture. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. AMUNDSEN-SCOTT STATION (ASB) - DAY - ESTABLISHING 
The red and white striped ceremonial south "pole" stands surrounded by international flags. 
SUPER TITLE: South Pole / Amundsen-Scott Station (USA) P opulation: 183                Temperature: - 55Â° 
Ice as far as the eye can see. In the background is the base. It's much smaller than McMurdo - a few dozen specialist buildings surrounding four circular buildings raised on hydraulic stands, interconnected by tubular shaped walkways. 
Off in the distance -- A SNOWCAT mounted with a plow, pushes small drifts of snow off the runway onto a LARGE BERM. It's been busy -- SEVERAL OTHER BERMS flank both sides of the runway. 
Camera pans to Carrie with a gear bag in tow, as she deplanes a LC-130. A HALF-DOMED HANGAR rises up on the other side of the plane. 
The main ASB complex is before her. 
The Tech at the console turns to her -- 
TECH Guys got the science lab all shut down. 
RHONDA Good, have them check all the pressure levels on the hydraulics, then clear the exterior storage bins. Make sure we're not leaving anything out there. 
Rhonda sees Carrie coming in the doorway. There's a flash of awkward tension that both mask with professional demeanor. 
RHONDA (CONT'D) Sam told me you'd be coming up -- how's the sleigh ride? 
CARRIE Fine. I need a plane and that pilot who saw the popsicle. 
RHONDA I'll have him meet you in the hangar. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
A moment of silence lingers as neither have anything else to say. 
CARRIE Yeah, good. 
Carrie leaves. 
EXT. BACK OF ASB - DAY 
Selecting a putter from a bag of golf clubs is DOC FURY, 60. Looks seasoned. Bearded. Wears the only non-red parka we've seen: it's royal blue, trimmed with black fur and emblazoned with dozens of emblems and patches from years of Antarctic service. 
DOC In less than three days we begin Winter-over. The sky will go completely black and stay that way for six months. 
Camera pulls back to REVEAL five NEWBIES (first-timers); an Asian, French, Brazilian, Danish and an American. All are standing on their jackets, shivering uncontrollably in the wind. 
DOC (cont'd) The sane ninety percent of the population will be leaving the ice. Extreme weather conditions make it impossible for planes from the outside world to land. You have chosen, for your own misguided reasons, to stay. And it is my responsibility to teach you beakers how not to die. 
Doc lines up on a hot pink golf ball and putts. 
The ball rolls across the glacier in an impossible, wind- driven arc, approaches a flag, and sinks. 
DOC (cont'd) Time? 
The Asian holds a stopwatch.    He stares at it stupidly. 
ASIAN T... T... Three minutes. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
DOC Your core body temperatures have fallen to approximately 97 degrees. You are shivering uncontrollably -- losing basic motor skills. You're having trouble focusing on even the simplest tasks. In short, you are well on your way to dying, and it has only been two-hundred seconds. (BEAT) Put your coats on. 
The class struggles into their jackets. Doc assists those who, in their diminished capacity, are having trouble figuring out how to put them on. 
DOC (cont'd) Your life is dependent on your awareness of the weather. So be aware. There is a condition that arises around here known as a whiteout. Don't get caught in it. Winds kick up snow that's lain on the ice for thousands of years -- can't see six inches in front of your nose. Temperature plummets to triple digits. We found bodies less than a foot from safety and warmth. 
Carrie walks up.    Doc's eyes brighten. 
DOC (cont'd) Class, here we have another of the many hazards found on Antarctica. Say hello to Marshal Stetko. 
Through a disjointed, chattering chorus -- 
CLASS Hello Marshal Stetko. 
DOC Always a pleasure to see you. Unlike most of the beaker-heads down here. (BEAT) Social visit? 
CARRIE I wish -- We got a job. I need you to take a ride with me. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) CARRIE (cont'd) (BEAT) Might be a body out on the ice. 
DOC Why's this crap always happen at the end of the season? 
Carrie pulls a Driver from Doc's golf bag.    Lines up another pink ball. 
DOC (cont'd) Too cold for driving. 
Carrie swings -- WHACK!   The ball shatters and pink bits rain down around them. 
CARRIE So it is. 
INT. ASB - HANGAR - DAY 
Carrie and Doc cross the interior, which houses Three double prop Twin Otters, two Snowcats, and six snowmobiles. Keller and two other employees are busy working on one of the Otters. 
DOC What's your gut say about this body? 
CARRIE My gut and I don't talk anymore. 
They continue, after a beat -- 
Delfy tips the nose of the plane down. The ice below is broken by jagged hills and yawning crevasses. 
DELFY It's right up here. 
He spirals down among the icy hills, visibility is poor. Heavy turbulence suddenly jars the plane sideways -- Delfy laughs at Doc's nervous reaction. 
DELFY (cont'd) I don't carry extra panties Doc, so keep it tight. (BEAT) There it is. 
He banks the plane and slips down into a valley. 
DELFY (cont'd) Three o'clock. 
CARRIE Yeah. Got it.      It's a popsicle alright. 
Down below is the body sprawled on the icy ground next to the crevice. 
CARRIE (cont'd) Red jacket.   He's American. 
EXT. ICE FIELD - LATER 
The Twin Otter is in the distant background. Carrie, Doc and Delfy, who has a gear bag slung over his shoulder, weave their way around huge ice boulders -- skirt small crevasses. Mid-conversation... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
DOC ... It's always different when they freeze. Some curl up. Some stretch out. Some tear their clothes off. They get delirious. What was that guy's name? 
CARRIE Linger. 
DOC Yeah. He's lost in a storm. We can't find him, but we hear him on the radio going on and on about the Serengeti heat and his wife, Janet. Next day, we find him frozen solid, wearing nothing but his bunny boots. 
Delfy stops.    Grimaces.    Drops the gear bag. 
DELFY Jesus. 
The CORPSE is just ahead -- a frozen display of death. 
They all stare at it - the body in unnatural angles, the spiderweb of frozen blood. Delfy looks nauseous. 
DOC Never seen a dead guy? 
Delfy slowly shakes his head, no. 
Carrie moves up to it. Takes a look down the deep crevice four feet away. Can't see the bottom. She walks around to get a look at the face. Blanches slightly. 
DOC (cont'd) You know him -- 
CARRIE So do you. Think his name's Weiss. We Wintered-over last year with him. Played cards a couple of times. 
DOC The guy who cheated? 
CARRIE Yeah.    Geologist, I think. 
Doc takes a look. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
DOC Damn -- 
Carrie pulls out a DIGITAL CAMERA from a pocket.     Shoots a couple of pics. 
Doc takes a look up behind them. The ice steepens sharply to a vast plateau, scattered with jagged boulders of ice. 
DOC (cont'd) Looks like he fell from up there. 
Carrie pauses with her camera, looks up -- doesn't seem as convinced. 
CARRIE Then where's his crampons -- his gear? 
Doc looks around -- she's right. 
DOC Maybe down the crevasse? 
CARRIE Yeah, maybe -- 
Carrie glances to Delfy. 
CARRIE (cont'd) What's the closest camp? 
DELFY Brits -- about eighty miles west. 
CARRIE (looking at body - Soto) What the hell where you doing all the way out here? 
Doc reaches down and tries to move the body -- doesn't budge -- frozen solid into the ice. 
DOC Ah Christ -- he's a sticker. 
TIME CUT TO: 
CU ON CARRIE'S HAND TUGGING ON THE ZIPPER 
Little by little, it starts to move -- then finally, ZIIIIIIIIIIP. The jacket opens up, barely -- like sliced skin. 
Doc watches as she tries to pry it open further, but can't. 
CARRIE Grab that side. 
She takes one half, he the other, and begin to pull. The jacket opens up, like bending metal -- slowly revealing a frozen, but extremely bloodsoaked chest area surrounding A DEEP PUNCTURE WOUND through the shirt. 
Doc's face sags.    Carrie stares at the wound. 
FLASH CUT TO: 
CARRIE'S MEMORY HIT: The well defined chest of a man wearing a tight T-shirt. A BULLET HOLE dead center. 
BACK TO SCENE 
Doc looks at Carrie with deep concern -- he's tuned in. 
DOC Stirring up a few things? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
CARRIE ...I'll be alright. 
Both take a moment looking at the body. 
DOC You know, this means a Federal Investigation, and we're witnesses. We may get stuck here. 
CARRIE I know. 
Doc looks to Carrie, gentle, like a dad would his daughter. 
DOC We both want to do the right thing Carrie -- but we also need to get off the ice. Right now we don't have to say a word. When they find something later -- hey, we didn't know. We were leaving, the body was frozen, we didn't have time to examine it. No one gets murdered in Antarctica. Think about it. Dead is dead. 
He eyes her pleadingly. 
CARRIE Exactly, this is the first murder in Antarctica, Doc -- and I can't just pretend it didn't happen. (BEAT) I'm sorry. 
DOC Why did I know you were going to say that? 
INT. CORRIDOR - SOON AFTER 
Carrie steps out into the hallway. Takes a moment, leaning against the wall, this whole thing wearing on her more than she's revealed. She tilts her head back. The second it hits the wall -- 
THE SOUND OF A GUNSHOT RINGS OUT! 
SMASH CUT TO: 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT (CARRIE'S MEMORY HIT) 
Carrie's beat to shit, soul weary. She's on her knees, full of blood. A man is on the floor between two beds before her. She holds her gun at her side. He's dead. 
BACK TO SCENE 
Carrie refocuses.   Pulls away from the wall.    Leaves the memory behind. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT.   CORRIDOR - ASB - LATER 
Carrie has a NEXTEL phone/walkie to her ear, making her way up the corridor. Moves past a couple of guys loading a dolly with boxes from an adjacent room. 
MURPHY (V.O.) What camp was he with? 
CARRIE I'm on my way to find out. 
MURPHY (V.O.) This is all I need right now. 
CARRIE I'm sure his family's thinking the same thing. 
MURPHY (V.O.) That's not what I meant. (BEAT) I'll contact the FBI -- see how they want to handle this. 
She hangs up. Approaches a closed door.      Name plate on it reads Dinkle -- SUB-STATIONS MANAGER. 
O.C. MOANING and GROANING -- great sex. Carrie rolls her eyes. Knocks on the door. No one answers. Moaning continues. She doesn't have time for this. Opens the door to see -- 
-- a large TV playing a locker-room porno where a quarterback with no pants is giving it to a cheerleader with no top. Half a dozen guys, oblivious to Carrie standing there, CHEER the action. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Suddenly, Carrie's NEXTEL RINGS -- takes it off her belt. 
CARRIE (cont'd) Stetko. 
JAMIE (V.O.) Marshal, it's Jamie. I've got some guy holding from Vostok who won't give his name, says he has to talk to you. 
CARRIE Vostok? (BEAT) Patch it through. 
JAMIE (V.O.) You're on now. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) 
CARRIE This is Marshal Stetko, who's this? 
MOONEY (V.O.) John Mooney. 
She's thrown. 
CARRIE Mooney? 
MOONEY (V.O.) You know who I am? 
Carrie's eyes shift to his picture on the desk. 
CARRIE What happened out there, Mooney? 
MOONEY (V.O.) You come to Vostok and we'll talk. Only you. 
CARRIE Where's Rubin? 
MOONEY (V.O.) Come to Vostok. 
CLICK. 
INT. CORRIDOR - RIGHT AFTER 
Carrie is moving at a quick pace. Passes the open door to the clinic. Sees Doc looking through some boxes, a glass of Scotch in hand. She stops. Backs up. 
CARRIE Getting drunk already? 
DOC Just gearing my liver up in case I have to stay the next six months. 
CARRIE Murphy's contacting the Feds. 
He looks over to her.    Raises his glass in a somber toast. 
DOC You're making my day. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
CARRIE I'll do everything I can to get you off this ice, promise. 
DOC I know you will. (BEAT) What's the hurry? 
CARRIE Going to Vostok. 
He raises a curious brow -- 
CARRIE (cont'd) One of the guys from Weiss' team called.   Wants to talk. 
DOC What's he doing in Russia? 
INT. OPERATIONS CENTER - DAY 
Carrie walks in. Rhonda has a phone to one ear, another in her hand. Looks stressed. She's hovering over one of the Techs who is sitting before a computer screen displaying Satellite Weather Imagery -- think Doppler. His focus is on a VAST STORM SYSTEM that is heading toward ASB, which is marked in RED NEON. Other stations are marked as well. 
RHONDA We're tracking it now. 
CARRIE I need a plane to Vostok. 
Rhonda raises her finger -- putting her on hold.      Carrie doesn't like it. 
RHONDA (into phone) I don't control the weather -- you want to stay the winter, then don't be ready for your evac. 
She looks to Carrie -- 
RHONDA (cont'd) Sorry, can't.    All the planes are committed. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
CARRIE I'm not asking. 
RHONDA What am I supposed to tell the deep drill ice core team getting picked up in four and a half? 
CARRIE Sure. 
Sets down his coffee on a nearby shelf. As he fastens it, Carrie pulls on her goggles and a face mask. They finish at the same time. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
DELFY Ever been on a rope-line in a whiteout? 
CARRIE Nope. Thoughts? 
DELFY Yeah, hold on tight. 
Delfy leaves as Carrie cranks the submarine-type wheel- lock in the center of the door. 
WHAM! The door is suddenly yanked from her grasp, slamming open against the building. Wind knocks her back. 
The storm sings in an even DULL ROAR. A solid white wall of wind-driven ice blows past. The light is oddly dim. 
CRACK! The coffee mug Delfy left on the shelf, breaks in half, exposing a cylinder of frozen coffee. It rolls across the shelf, falls, and shatters on the floor. 
Carrie struggles back to the door and clips a three-foot tether from her harnesses to a RED STORM LINE attached to the side of the building. 
She steps into the storm. 
EXT. WHITEOUT - THE LINE - CONTINUOUS 
Carrie leans into the door, pushing it closed and locking the wheel. 
Two steps into the storm, the building behind her is gone. Step after step, there's nothing but the guide line and the ROAR of the storm. 
A gust of wind lifts her off the ground.     She's caught by her tether and smacked down on the ice. 
Slowly regaining her stance, she pushes onward. Finally Carrie runs into something. It takes her a moment to realize she's at a building. 
She grabs the wheel-lock and turns, breaking ice, opening the door. 
INT. OUTLYING BUILDING - READY ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Unclipping from the line, she closes the door on the HOWLING behind her. Pulls off her mask. Teeth are chattering. 
She spins the wheel-lock of the door going out of the ready room into the building. 
CUT TO: 
INT. OUTLYING BUILDING - HALLWAY - RIGHT AFTER 
Carrie hits the lights: nothing. No power. Just a sliver of light stabbing in through a window. 
CARRIE (calling out) Mooney? Hello? 
Only silence responds. 
The hallway is long and dark, leading away from her in both directions. She draws a flashlight from her pocket. Thumbs the switch, sending a beam out through the dark. 
Something doesn't feel right. Slides her baton out from her belt. She decides to go left. 
Walking the hall, she tries door after door.   Finally one gives. 
CARRIE (cont'd) Mooney? 
She cautiously pushes it open: four stripped bunks in an empty room. 
Moves on down the corridor -- hears COUGHING, like someone trying to clear their throat. 
Looks ahead, and determines it's coming from behind a closed door at the end of the hall. 
It's confirmed when she hears it again. 
Stops at the door. 
She slowly opens it -- 
Now she can hear HEAVY, LABORED BREATHING -- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
-- Sweeps the inside with her light. It's a large lounge type room: scattered chairs, tables, and an overturned sofa on the other side -- where the heavy breathing's coming from. Another cough. 
She enters the room. 
INSIDE THE LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS 
Inching forward, she gets to the sofa. Looks over it to see A BODY -- it's Mooney, lying in a pool of blood. Struggling to breathe through a puncture wound to his esophagus. 
More dead than alive, Carrie stumbles against the door and grabs the wheel-lock with both hands. 
Unable to bend the frozen fingers of her left hand around the wheel, she struggles to turn it. Finally it gives. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
The door swings wide and she stumbles in. But she's caught; her bare hand frozen to the metal. 
Ripping it free, her SCREAM is lost to the wind. 
Carrie falls, collapsing against the door.       Blackout 
SMASH CUT TO 
INT. MOTEL 6 - BATHROOM - NIGHT (CARRIE'S MEMORY HIT) 
A single bulb above casts a cone of light down onto Carrie, who's leaning against a sink, staring at herself in a mirror. She looks stressed. Her Marshal's badge dangles around her neck.   Wears a shoulder harness. The bathroom door behind her is open. 
She catches a REFLECTION of a shadow moving across the room behind her. Body tenses. 
As she turns -- 
CARRIE Jack? 
No answer. 
She withdraws a 9mm from her harness -- eases toward the door. 
Gun ready, she rolls her back around the jam -- WHAM! Carrie's blindsided by a fist that drives her into the other door jam. 
Before she can recover -- a guy, dark eyes, unshaven, grabs her by the hair and runs her head first into the bathroom mirror. SMASH. It's brutal. Shards fall into the sink, as Carrie's RIGHT TEMPLE goes bloody. She drops to the floor -- 
CARRIE'S POV - A BLURRY FIGURE stands over top of her. She's still got some fight in her -- hands lash out in a frenzy, like a cat in water. 
CARRIE (cont'd) Jack! 
DELFY O.C. Wo wo wo.   It's okay, it's okay. 
The figure materializes around her.     It's Delfy, holding her down. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Carrie slowly settles, then she's out again. 
TIME CUT TO: 
INT. OPERATIONS ROOM - VOSTOK - LATER 
She's lying on a table, wrapped in blankets. An old, WRINKLED FACED RUSSIAN MAN slowly lowers her wounded hand -- pale white and missing some skin, back into a tray of water next to her. Her silver ring glistens under the florescent lights. A HUGE BRUISE runs across her arm. 
CARRIE What happened? 
DELFY When   you didn't come back -- we went   looking for you. Found a dead   guy in the other building -- that   Mooney? 
CARRIE Yeah. Someone got to him before I did. Then went after me. (BEAT) How long was I out? 
DELFY A couple hours. 
Carrie's eyes drift to the old man next to her. 
DELFY (cont'd) He's been looking after you. 
He flashes a smile of crooked, yellow teeth. 
CARRIE Thanks. 
As she starts to sit up, he protests, saying something in Russian. She ignores him. He walks away, mumbling something else. 
She sits up. Lifts her hand out of the water -- fingers are slow moving. 
CARRIE (cont'd) I need to get back in there. 
INT. OUTLYING BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY 
Delfy and Carrie, with her hand bandaged, both slice the dark with flashlights. She's starting to get her bearings back. 
DELFY Whoever it was, could have flown out after the storm broke. 
They walk a few silent beats, then -- 
DELFY (cont'd) Who's Jack? 
It's a moment before she responds -- 
CONTINUED: 
Pryce is in the backseat, Delfy is driving. Carrie is next to him with the map and her GPS in hand. She stares at a tiny blinking red light on the GPS -- 
FLASH CUT TO: 
EXT. HOTEL 6 - LOBBY - NIGHT (CARRIE'S MEMORY HIT) 
FLASHING POLICE REDS reflect off the glass of the front doors of a hotel. Several squad cars are nosed up to the entrance. 
Patrons and bystanders are perched in various locations, watching as A HANDCUFFED Carrie is escorted outside by two uniformed officers. Her eyes are full of tears. 
She's put into the backseat of one of the cars. As the door closes, she stares out the window where Coroners are loading a body under a sheet into the back of their truck. 
BACK TO SCENE 
INT. SNOWCAT - DAY 
Delfy's looking at Carrie like he's waiting for an answer. 
DELFY I said "which way?" 
She glances to the GPS. 
CARRIE North. 
Pryce sees Carrie pause for a moment, massaging her gloved left hand. 
PRYCE Hurt? 
CARRIE Yeah, a little. 
He can see it aches more than she's letting on. 
PRYCE How long have you been down here, Marshal? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
CARRIE Almost two years. 
PRYCE What brought you to the ice? 
She pauses, humored. 
CARRIE (SARCASTIC) The excitement, mostly. 
PRYCE Everyone down here is running away from something. 
CARRIE Some shrink tell you that? 
PRYCE Yeah, and that I should call my mother more often 
CARRIE And do you? 
PRYCE Every Sunday. 
CARRIE Where do you plant your boots? 
PRYCE They got me working out of Christchurch, New Zealand. Beautiful country. But this -- crazy place to make a living. 
She takes a moment, gazing out the window to the endless landscape of white. 
CARRIE I came down to fill in for a Marshal for six weeks before Winter-over. I met someone, decided to stay. 
PRYCE He give you that ring I saw? Tell you he was going to marry you? 
CARRIE No -- just gave me a headache. (BEAT) (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) CARRIE (cont'd) I didn't see a ring on your finger. 
PRYCE Flattered that you even looked. 
A faint beeping noise emanates from her GPS. 
CARRIE This is it. 
All eyes go ahead as they drive on.   Looking.   Nothing but an icy plateau. 
After a couple of beats -- 
CARRIE (cont'd) Stop. 
DELFY There's nothing here. 
CARRIE Just stop. 
DELFY It'd be on the ceiling in case of an ocean landing. 
Carrie watches Pryce's flashlight moving about in the cargo area of the aircraft. 
PRYCE Found it! 
Carrie and Delfy get to Pryce. They follow his beam straight up to expose an ESCAPE HATCH in the roof of the fuselage. 
PRYCE (cont'd) With the angle of the plane, I don't think we're that far from the surface. Give me a hand. 
Pryce moves to a large crate -- starts to push it over. They join, sliding it over below the hatch. 
He jumps up onto it -- examines the hatch area. 
PRYCE (cont'd) These are explosive bolts. If we blow the hatch, maybe it'll smash a hole up through the ice. 
CARRIE Or, if the ice is too thick the blast will come right back at us. 
PRYCE We can be blown up, suffocate or freeze to death. Take your pick. 
Pryce hands Carrie the flashlight. She targets the hatch area as he opens an electrical panel beside it; a crisscrossing maze of wires. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) 
As he reaches up to examine the wiring, Carrie catches a GLIMPSE of a SHOULDER HARNESS under his liner. 
PRYCE (cont'd) This could work -- give me the battery from your phone. 
As he looks down, Carrie masks her discovery.   Hands over her phone. He extracts the BATTERY. 
PRYCE (cont'd) When I connect these two wires, hopefully there's going to be a big bang. May want to take some cover. 
Pryce is nervous himself as he places one selected wire onto the battery, and prepares for another. 
He looks to Carrie and Pryce who have backed up against the fuselage. 
PRYCE (cont'd) You guys ready? 
Delfy nods. 
Carrie is still running that shoulder holster through her head. 
Pryce touches the last wire to the battery.   Nothing happens. Hope freezes. 
Pryce tries again -- 
-- KA-BOOM! The hatch EXPLODES INWARD, ricocheting around the inside of the cargo hold like a giant bullet coming in and out of their light. 
SLAM, SLAM, SLAM, until...WHAM, it buries itself edge-on, halfway into the fuselage, missing Carrie by a hair's width. 
They stand there, deafened and stunned, then a shower of ice rains into the plane where the hatch used to be and a THIN SHAFT OF LIGHT DROPS into the cargo bay like a gift from God. 
DELFY Hallelujah -- 
Pryce drops down.   Moves to another crate. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (4) 
PRYCE Delfy, help me with this.     We'll need to get up higher. 
Delfy moves forward to help. The two of them push it over. It's a strenuous lift to get it on top of the other. 
Just as they finish, Pryce turns to find himself facing Carrie holding one of the RUSSIAN'S GUNS TO HIS FACE. 
CARRIE Don't move. 
Pryce stares at her in disbelief. 
PRYCE What's going on? 
DELFY Yeah -- what're you doing? 
CARRIE Our friend here isn't who he says he is. 
She reaches into Pryce's liner, pulls out his sidearm from the shoulder holster. 
Switches it with the one in her hand.    Puts the Russian gun in her coat pocket. 
CARRIE (cont'd) Didn't you know it's a direct treaty violation to carry a firearm down here? 
PRYCE I've been authorized because of what's happened. 
CARRIE Stop lying to me -- 
DELFY You think Rubin might try to leave out of McMurdo? 
CARRIE He knows I'm on his ass, so he might. Anything's possible. I want to eliminate his options. 
She massages her gloved hand. Looks to Pryce who's talking on his PDA as he heads toward the Cat. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
PRYCE (INTO PHONE) Six cannisters, maybe four inches in diameter, about a foot high -- find out exactly what the Russians transported in something that size. 
He looks to Carrie -- 
PRYCE (cont'd) You have a photo of Rubin anywhere? 
CARRIE Back at ASB -- 
PRYCE (to Delfy) How long to get there? 
DELFY When we get back to the plane, I'll get ya there in forty minutes. 
As Pryce climbs into the cat -- 
INT. SNOWCAT - CONTINUOUS 
And slides into the back -- 
PRYCE (into phone) I'll scan a picture of him and get it to you. Meanwhile, contact every non-American base down here and put them on watch. He's got some plan to get these off the ice. 
He hangs up. Carrie climbs in -- looks back at the plane's ski tracks. 
CARRIE I know why Weiss was so far from Delta One One. 
Pryce and Delfy wait for the answer. 
CARRIE cont'd) He was dumped from a plane. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
She closes the door to the Cat. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT.   CORRIDOR - ASB - DAY 
Carrie strides along the corridor with Pryce. They pass a window where we see that an LC-13O EVAC PLANE is parked out front -- it's tail section open like the mouth of a massive beast. Move past several people, balloons and `Eve of Evac' signs. 
Pryce sees Carrie really cradling her left hand, now. 
PRYCE You need to get that looked at. 
CARRIE I'll have the Doc take a peek when we're done. 
Dinkle's pulling a DUFFLE BAG toward them.      Sees Carrie and Pryce about to head up some stairs. 
DINKLE Murphy's looking for you. 
Carrie stops. 
CARRIE Murphy?   What the hell is he doing HERE 
DINKLE Came in on the evac. 
She pulls Dinkle's two-way off his hip.       Hands it to Pryce. 
DINKLE (cont'd) Hey -- I don't turn that in, I have to pay for it. 
Carrie ignores him. 
CARRIE I'm on 30 if you need me. Rubin's picture is in a file on my desk. 
Dinkle shoots Pryce the stink eye as he walks away -- 
DINKLE Make sure I get that back. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
PRYCE Of course. 
Pryce heads up as Carrie continues on down the main corridor. 
INT. OPERATION CENTER - ASB - DAY 
Murphy and Rhonda are standing next to the COMMS TECH, who is sitting in front of his COMPUTER. The screen revealing the SATELLITE IMAGERY of the storm It's grown and moving closer to ASB. 
DOC I striped him down to put him in a bodybag. There's only the puncture from the axe. No way, I would have noticed it. Why? 
CARRIE Then it's gotta be Rubin. (BEAT) I don't know. 
DOC Any word from the FBI? 
CARRIE There's no way they're gonna make it. Not with that storm coming in over the peninsula. 
The gauze finally comes off, revealing her middle TWO FINGERS have turned COMPLETELY BLACK along with part of the flesh of her palm. Her ring looks strangely out of place. 
CARRIE (cont'd) Oh God. 
Doc reaches over to a nearby drawer -- takes out a sterilized syringe packet. 
DOC Jesus, Carrie, how long did you let this go? 
He opens up the packet. 
CARRIE When did I go to Vostok? 
Doc puts the tip of the needle onto her blackened flesh. 
DOC Feel that? 
He pushes hard -- penetrates the skin. We see the worry begin to elevate further on Carrie's face. 
CARRIE No. 
Doc tries the needle in another location. 
DOC Now? (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
Slowly shakes her head.   He holds her gaze evenly. 
DOC (cont'd) I have to amputate your middle two fingers. 
CARRIE (STUNNED) No way. Don't tell me that. 
DOC The fingers are dead, Carrie. If I don't do it now, gangrene will set in. You'll lose your hand. 
Carrie is sickened. 
DOC (cont'd) I'm sorry. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. MEDICAL CLINIC - LATER 
Carrie sits in sullen silence, the room dark around her. The only light bounces in from a sterile, draped area where Doc works on her hand. She can't watch as his CURVED SUTURE and thread, rises and falls with every stitch he makes. Carrie has her attention on BLOODY GAUZE piled up in a tray -- 
SMASH CUT TO 
CARRIE'S MEMORY HIT: AN IMAGE SHE SAW EARLIER: The well defined chest of a man wearing a T-shirt. A BULLET HOLE oozes dead center. This time we stay there a little longer, watching the T-shirt absorb the blood around the wound. As the stain widens, so does the camera... slowly... bringing into picture THE MAN Carrie shot. He's wearing a MARSHAL'S BADGE around his neck. 
DOC (O.C.) There, finished. 
BACK TO SCENE 
Carrie looks at him, sullen, afraid to look down.     Then slowly lets her eyes drift to her hand. 
DOC (cont'd) It's going to be an adjustment. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
He rises. Goes to a medicine cabinet. Selects a pill bottle. Shakes it. Only a couple inside. He returns with the pill bottle. 
DOC (cont'd) Should ease the pain. I'll look around, dig some more up for you. 
She stares at the vacant spot where her fingers used to be. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. CARRIE'S BEDROOM - ASB - DAY 
Carrie's bag is open on the bed with the Russian's gun next to it. 
She's trying to put on a clean flannel over a T-shirt, but can't button it up with only one hand. Her frustration mounts as she fights back every bit of emotion that's trying to get out. 
She finally gives up -- kicks over a nearby chair that sweeps the stuff off her bed. Bag and gun go flying. 
Carrie slumps to the floor.    Silent tears. 
After a beat -- she notices Pryce standing in the doorway with some PAPERS in his hand. He's looking at her compassionately. 
PRYCE I stopped by the clinic... Doc told me. 
He moves closer.   Starts to button her up. 
PRYCE (cont'd) For what it's worth -- I think you're pretty tough, Marshall. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MARSHAL'S OFFICE - ASB - RIGHT AFTER 
Carrie enters. Light streaming in through the window hits her tired face. She reaches for the light switch on the nearby wall -- 
-- A HAND GRABS HERS -- 
-- AGGRESSIVELY YANKS her away from the open door. It's kicked closed as she's drawn backwards into a man's embrace. A knife's brought to her neck. 
MAN (raspy, deep) ...You Stetko? 
Carrie nods -- slides her hand toward her pocket... 
MAN (cont'd) Don't... 
She stops. 
CARRIE Who are you? 
He slowly turns her around to face him. 
-- it's Rubin, but he looks beat to shit. Deep cracks slice across his bloody, chapped lips. Peeling skin flakes on his face. Desperate, despondent eyes. Shaky, frostbitten fingers. He's having a hard time holding it together as he can barely get the words out... 
RUBIN -- Did Mooney talk to you? I didn't hear from him -- he was supposed to call me after you talked. 
Carrie's confused. 
CARRIE Mooney's dead. 
His eyes well. 
RUBIN No... 
CARRIE And so's Weiss. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
He nods - he knew. 
RUBIN And I'm next, I know it. 
CARRIE It's okay, you're safe, just put the knife down. 
His shaking hands slowly lowers it -- she breathes a little easier. He sets it down on an empty book shelf next to him. 
CARRIE (cont'd) Who's after you? Where are the cannisters? 
He stares off blankly -- 
RUBIN Weiss didn't want to go through with it. Oh God. How did we let this happen? 
CARRIE Rubin -- I need you to focus for me. 
He tries. Looks at her through tired, pinched eyes -- he's trying. 
O.C. KNOCK. KNOCK on her door. 
Rubin is spooked.    Glares at her -- scared.   Like a caged animal. 
DOC (O.C.) Carrie, it's Doc -- got those painkillers. 
CARRIE It's okay, he's a doctor, he can help you. 
It falls on deaf ears -- he goes for the knife.    She tries to stop him. 
Rubin shoves her aside, throwing her against a chair. She topples backwards. 
He whips open the door, driving an unexpected shoulder into Doc, who gets nailed so hard, he goes stumbling back up against the wall behind him. Takes the wind right out of him. Pills all over the floor. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
Rubin dashes off down the hallway -- it's an effort. 
Carrie appears at the door. Catches a glimpse of Rubin disappearing down a set of side stairs. 
CARRIE (cont'd) You alright? 
Doc nods. 
She takes off after him, pulling her phone off her hip. 
She twists free of his grasp.      Gets in Keller's face. 
CARRIE (cont'd) Where in the plane? (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) 
KELLER Find them yourself. 
MURPHY What the hell's going on? 
She glares at him. 
CARRIE The cannisters are on the plane. 
She looks to the guys that came out with Murphy. 
CARRIE (cont'd) Throw him in the holding cell. 
The two guys go to Keller, but his arm is stuck to the ground. Carrie kicks it free. It's painful. Keller screams. 
The guys lift him to his feet.     Haul him away. 
Murphy looks to Pryce -- 
MURPHY Who the hell are you? 
Carrie looks at Pryce. 
PRYCE Name's Pryce. 
Pryce looks at Carrie. 
CARRIE He's with the UN. We have to search that plane now! 
Murphy looks to Carrie with an intense glare -- 
MURPHY We don't have time. We'll just search it in Christchurch when it lands. 
Pryce steps in -- 
PRYCE It's a twelve hour flight to Christchurch. Anything can happen in that time. Keller is here, so we know it's still on the ground. (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (4) PRYCE (cont'd) Once that plane is in the air, we've as good as lost it. Just give us 10 minutes. 
Murphy looks to Carrie, softens slightly -- 
CARRIE Sam, do what is right here.    Come on. 
MURPHY Do what you have to, but that plane takes off in one hour. 
CARRIE We'll need some help. 
MURPHY I'll send what I can. 
He leaves. 
TIME CUT TO: 
INT. LC-130 - DAY 
Carrie is near the cockpit, searching under a row of seats. Pryce approaches. A handful of ASB employees tear through every inch of the fuselage and cargo. 
PRYCE It's clean. 
Carrie gets to her feet.    Pissed off. 
PRYCE (cont'd) You check the cockpit? 
CARRIE Nothing. That bastard. What the hell are you up to, Keller? 
PRYCE I don't get it, why lie to us -- we have him either way. He's stuck here. 
Carrie's suddenly chilled with the ominous reality that -- 
CARRIE He's buying time. 
Carrie races off the plane.    Pryce tries to keep pace. 
INT. CORRIDOR - RIGHT AFTER 
Carrie is slaloming her way through the corridor, which is packed with ASB employees carrying their bags for the evac. Pryce is close behind. 
CARRIE Out of the way! 
INT. ASB - MARSHAL'S OFFICE - RIGHT AFTER 
Bullets PLANT in the WINDSHIELD, but can't penetrate -- glass is too thick -- protection from the cold. 
Keller throttles. Begins to move the Otter forward toward the opening doors. 
Carrie dashes to Pryce. Sees Delfy get to his feet. Face bloody. He moves to Pryce. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
She gets over to the guys quickly, giving Delfy a visual once over. He'll be fine, but things look bad for Pryce. He's bleeding profusely. 
She kneels beside him -- pulls the tip of the axe out of his chest. 
Delfy looks to the hangar doors, which are nearly open. 
PRYCE ...I didn't see him. 
His eyes flutter shut.   Carrie slaps his face -- 
CARRIE No!    You stay awake! 
Puts her hand directly on the wound.   Applies pressure. Blood continues to ooze. 
She looks over to Keller just as his plane exits the hangar. 
Looks back to Pryce's wound -- won't stop bleeding. 
CARRIE (cont'd) Damn it! (to Delfy) Come on. We're getting him up. 
They lift him to his feet. Haul ass to the front of the hangar the best they can. Go outside. 
EXT. HANGAR - CONTINUOUS 
The two of them place the now unconscious Pryce to the ground. 
Carrie grabs Delfy's hands. Puts them directly on the bloody wound. Surprisingly, he stays focused. 
CARRIE Press here.    Hard. Hard or he will die! 
DELFY It won't stop! 
Looks Delfy right in the eye. 
CARRIE He's not going to be number four! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Pryce moans. 
Carrie rips open Pryce's jacket and liner. 
Scoops up an armful of wind-blown ice. Starts packing it around him. Keeps repeating the motion. 
She keeps shooting looks to Keller's departing plane moving toward the runway. 
The cold hits Pryce, shocking him awake. 
PRYCE (GASPING) What are you doing?   Get Keller. 
She holds him down. 
CARRIE You're bleeding out. Freezing drops your pulse. We have to slow it down. (BEAT) You hold on. 
Carrie snags the two-way off her hip like it's a quick draw. Keys it. 
CARRIE (cont'd) Sam -- is Doc on the plane yet? 
Beat. 
MURPHY (V.O.) No -- what's going -- 
CARRIE Keller got out. He hurt Pryce -- he's bleeding bad. Where's Doc? 
MURPHY (V.O.) In the clinic. About to bring the bodies out. What's -- 
CARRIE Tell him to stay put, and I need your help getting Pryce there. We're at the hangar. I've got to stop Keller, he's got the cannisters. 
Carrie doesn't wait for an answer.     Gives Delfy the two- way. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
CARRIE (cont'd) Don't let him die. 
MURPHY Doc! 
Doc quickly moves into the front room.      The other two follow. Curious. 
Doc springs into action, pulling on gloves.       Pryce's face, ashen. 
DOC Get him on the table! 
They usher him onto one. He looks to Delfy who still has his hand on Pryce's wound. 
DOC (cont'd) Don't move that hand. 
DELFY I know, I know, he'll die! 
Doc shifts his attention to one of Murphy's guys -- 
DOC You, four units O-pos in the warmer. Second shelf, fridge. 
The guy heads for it. 
Carrie enters. She's still in her ECW gear.        Heart sinks when she sees Pryce. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Doc leans over Pryce's pale form.        Examines. 
As Doc gets an IV going, he looks to Carrie -- 
DOC (cont'd) What happened? 
CARRIE Keller hit him with an ice axe. 
MURPHY He get away? 
CARRIE No. 
Murphy's walkie on his hip CRACKLES to life. 
INT. LC-130 - SAME 
Rhonda's standing up front with the pilot and Copilot, watching the horizon where dark storm clouds are coming at them like a tidal wave. Brings a walkie to her lips... 
RHONDA Sam, it's Rhonda -- we gotta go. Now. MURPHY (V.O.) I know.    I know. 
INT. MEDICAL       CLINIC - ASB - SAME Murphy looks to Doc. 
MURPHY Can you do this on the plane? It's your call, but I need to know now. 
Doc, who's wrestling with deep contemplation, looks to Carrie -- she sees the answer's no. 
CARRIE I'll stay with you -- 
MURPHY (to his guys) Grab the bodies and get them on the plane. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
The guys head for the back -- 
As Doc looks at Pryce -- knowing he needs him... 
DOC Leave the bodies -- you don't have time. Dead is dead. (BEAT) Pick them up in six months. Go. 
Doc looks to Carrie, who's thankful -- 
CARRIE I'm sorry. 
The guys after the bodies look to Murphy for a decision. 
MURPHY Leave'm.   Let's go. 
Murphy and Carrie exchange a quick look -- closure. 
CARRIE Thanks. 
MURPHY Take care of yourself. 
He takes off with the others. 
EXT. LC - 130 - RIGHT AFTER 
The wind   is hurricane fierce as Murphy and his two men are just   about to board the plane. Murphy looks to the storm --   a forboding darkness getting closer by the second.    He realizes they might not make it. 
EXT. RUNWAY - ASB - RIGHT AFTER 
She heads out the door. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CONNECTING TUNNEL TO SCIENCE BUILDING - LATER 
Carrie slips in. We've been here before -- this is where she chased Rubin. 
Darkness creeps in, phantom like, as the remaining daylight FADES OUT through the row of windows that run along the side. Carrie's plunged into inky black. WINTER HAS SET IN. 
She HEARS the Science Lab door open before her -- peers through the dark blanket to see Doc walking toward her. 
Carrie slips in between two bookcases, trying to stay tight against the wall. Doc walks right by and out the door. 
She rises to her feet. Hurries down to the end. Disappears into the science building. 
INT. SCIENCE LAB - CONTINUOUS 
Carrie enters. Turns on the light. Illuminates the lab stations, and the busted open doors of the Ready Room. Heads for the freezer. 
INT. WALK-IN FREEZER - SCIENCE LAB - CONTINUOUS 
Carrie opens the door.    Illuminates the interior with her light. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Storage racks of frozen science samples line the three walls. Lying on the floor are the bodies of Mooney, Rubin, Weiss and Keller. 
Carry goes to Weiss' body. Kneels next to him. Goes to unzip the bodybag, but sees that it's been locked with a plastic cinch. 
Pulls out her knife. Holds the light steady in her mouth as she cuts the cinch. Unzips the bag. 
Her light travels down his body to his left leg. She rolls it slightly for a better look. The truth hits her like a sledge hammer. There it is, like standing center stage in her light, the ROW OF STITCHES holding a deep gash tight together. 
She's about to stand and walk out, but she stops herself. Thinks about that leg, those stitches. The fact that Doc lied to her. Pans her light over at the other bodies on the floor. Her light pans back, explores the rest of Weiss' upper body -- sees a dried river of blood that's run out from under his armpit. 
CARRIE (to herself) Someplace no one would ever think to look. 
She raises Weiss' arm.    More stitches. 
She cuts through them. Skin splits to reveal the BOTTOM OF A CANNISTER that's been stuffed inside his chest. She reaches in and pulls it out. Even has rust on the bottom. Carrie's confused -- IT'S NOT LIKE ANY OF THE CANNISTERS PRYCE SHOWED HER PHOTOS OF. It look more like THE ICE CORE CONTAINER SHE SAW AT MCMURDO. 
She contemplates opening it for a moment, then places her hand on the top. Begins to twist. It loosens easily. Pulls the lid off. Looks at it. Whatever it is, it's frozen. Tilts the can slightly, and out slides a FOOT LONG ICE CORE SAMPLE. Can't quite figure it out, until she shines her light on it -- 
The freezer DANCES WITH GLISTENING LIGHT. The core sample is PACKED FULL OF DIAMONDS. She looks to the other two bodies. 
She opens Mooney's bag. Sees his chest is uneven -- more cylinders inside. Repeats the action with Rubin. Same thing. 
Carrie slowly stands -- the betrayal almost too much. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
DOC (O.C.) If they had just gone along with it. 
She turns -- Doc is standing right BEHIND HER. 
DOC (cont'd) Those fools found a plane -- had no idea what they stumbled onto. Turns out the Russians had discovered a diamond field while drilling for core samples in the sixties. 
CARRIE And we thought it was nukes the whole time. 
DOC Keller said he knew someone in the states who could move the diamonds for us. It was a hell of a lot of money. 
CARRIE How did you get wrapped up in thing, Doc? 
DOC Weiss got hurt on the plane. They were afraid to move him, so Mooney called me. Keller and I flew out. But they couldn't get the safe open -- Keller found a way. 
CARRIE Then Weiss got cold feet. It got ugly, didn't it -- and Keller killed him at Delta One One. Everything went to hell after that, didn't it, Doc. 
DOC Keller thought he could kill his way out of this whole thing. (ANGRY) If those idiots hadn't panicked, none of this would have happened. 
He turns and walks out of the freezer. 
INT. SCIENCE LAB - CONTINUOUS 
Carrie carefully follows. Sees he's heading for KELLER'S ICE AXE in the ready room, that someone's removed from being wedged outside, onto the now uprighted LAB CART Pryce used to bust open the door. 
CARRIE Doc -- stop. 
He does. Turns back to her. But there has been a subtle shift inside him -- something illogical. 
DOC I'll cut you in, Carrie. There's at least 5 million in diamonds in there. That can buy both of us a nice life back in the world. How many times have we both talked about having a fresh start. Well, this is it. Those beakers finding that plane was a sign. A sign telling me it was time to go back. Now I have something to go back for. 
She has a realization. 
CARRIE There is no granddaughter, is there? This was about greed, plain and simple. 
DOC No one will ever know. It's just me and you. We can take care of Pryce.

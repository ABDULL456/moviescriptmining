FADE IN: 
INT.  MIKE'S HOUSE - QUEENS - EARLY EVENING 
Winter.  A celebration.  Close friends, cop friends, family all here to celebrate patrolman MIKE KEEGAN'S promotion to detective, NYPD. 
The party spills through the house -- front room, dining room, kitchen, with a small fenced backyard visible beyond that.  A community of cops on their off-hours, their wives, kids.  A mix of generations, all the way from MIKE'S kid, TOMMY, and his FRIENDS, playing among the adults, to an elderly woman observing quietly from her chair at the side.  The mood's warm, spirited; there's a lot of friendship here. 
ANGLE:  MIKE, in the dining room, posing for a photo with his ten-year-old son, TOMMY, proudly displaying his new gold detective's SHIELD pinned to his jersey. 
MIKE (calling to his wife, for a family portrait) Ellie!  C'mon!  Over here! 
ANGLE:  ELLIE, MIKE'S wife of fifteen years, a local product, bright and lively, and clearly proud as hell of her man.  She frees herself from the crush of friends, hurrying to join him. 
ANGLE:  MIKE, ELLIE giving him a full-mouthed smack on the lips as he hooks her into his arms. 
The picture's snapped, to a chorus of hoots and hollers. Behind, a banner and poster blowup of Mike in gun and uniform read:  "FINALLY THEY'VE RECOGNIZED YOU, DETECTIVE KEEGAN." 
SCOTTY, a patrolman with the 117th and one of MIKE'S best pals, puts his hand vigorously, in congratulations, on MIKE'S SHOULDER. 
SCOTTY (to Mike) No joke?  You're being transferred to the 19th as your first assignment?  Who the hell loves your ass downtown? 
ROOKIE (naively) What's the 21st? 
BROOKLYN, a cop about Mike's age, joins in. 
SCOTTY What d'you care?  You'll never know. 
BROOKLYN Manhattan.  The Upper East Side, East 59th to 96th. 
The ROOKIE stares, impressed. 
SCOTTY (to the others) Remember Curran from the Sixteenth? He posted a coupla months there on a floater outside the French embassy. He met Jackie Kennedy. 
BROOKLYN Curran, that fuckin' noodlehead.  He probably wrote her up for letting her dog dump on Rockefeller's doorstep. 
ANGLE ON MIKE, trying to swallow a mouthful of potato salad as a plump and pretty middle-aged woman (HELEN GREENING) pulls him into a bear hug, planting a kiss on him. 
HELEN Mmmmmm-glimmmeee-kisss!  I'm so proud of you!  What the hell took you so long? 
MIKE Hey, don't ask me.  Ask the man who put in the good word. 
ANGLE ON T.J. GREENING, Helen's husband, Mike's best friend.  He's forty, stocky, looks up, horsing around with some of the kids in the next room. 
MIKE If T.J. didn't push for me, I never would've made it. 
BROOKLYN Bet your ass... I give you six weeks before you're back on the beat, Keegan, they got no room for hero cops... 
MIKE Appreciate, that vote of confidence, Brook. 
BROOKLYN Hey, am I supportive, or what? 
ANGLE ON TOMMY:  in the hallway, trying to show SCOTTY'S date -- a "real" BIMBO, who's spilling out of her woolly sweater and tight jeans -- how to stand on his SKATEBOARD. She shrieks a laugh, toppling off.  HELEN, passing by with an empty platter, catches the action. 
INT.  KITCHEN - SAME 
ELLIE, another WIFE at the sink, wives all; HELEN enters. 
HELEN He left Elaine for that? 
WIFE #1 And what about little Scotty? 
ELLIE continues washing the dishes as HELEN and the WIFE dry.  MIKE enters to get more beers. 
HELEN (still staring) I'd like to tie her tits together. 
ELLIE That wouldn't be too difficult. 
A nondescript piece of rundown city block that's the hottest thing in town.  PERSONNEL regulate the CROWD and ARRIVALS.  There is a public line, and from it the young, hip and outrageous can look on while awaiting entrance at the formally dressed, stylishly gowned GUESTS arriving at the private line. 
A glittering post-Metropolitan Museum of Art opening gala is in progress tonight.  The club's private entrance looks like what it once was, a shuttered porno bookstore, and the joke's not lost on most of the formal GUESTS, arriving through the X-rated doorway. 
INT.  CLUB - NIGHT 
The latest achievement of money, rock and art.  It's a breathtaking multi-leveled theater of light, sound and dance. 
There is also an entrance-by-invitation-only grand salon. 
ANGLE 
The GUESTS arriving here for the Met gala enter almost in enchanted procession, each of them being personally greeted by the primary owner and manager of the club, WIN HOCKINGS, a charming, rakish ex-preppy.  WIN stands in the middle of the floor in the throw of a spot, greeting. This is his element and his club, a son of old money, and a crossover creature to the fast life. 
WIN Hi... nice to see you... thank you... my pleasure... 
A MET BENEFACTRESS (effusively) Thank you so much for agreeing to host us tonight.  It's really extraordinary! 
WIN Glad I could be of help. 
CAMERA MOVING IN ON A NEW ANGLE, CLAIRE GREGORY and NEIL STEINHART.  The way our CAMERA covers them makes it clear they are major characters in our story.  NEIL steps forward to introduce himself, but WIN, looking up, spots CLAIRE first:  A special beauty and clearly someone very special to him... 
WIN Claire! 
CLAIRE Hello, Win. 
And he embraces her. 
CLAIRE (introducing her companion) You know Neil Steinhart? 
He grins broadly, taking NEIL'S hand; then right back to CLAIRE. 
WIN Of the filthy rich Steinharts?  Why is it Claire always connects with the richest men this side of Saudi? 
NEIL (to Win; meaning the club) This gives new meaning to the word nightlife. 
WIN acknowledges the obligatory compliment with a closed smile, impatiently returning to CLAIRE: 
WIN C'mon, let's get outa this lowbrow rag trade... (smiles, cutting Neil out) You don't mind, do you? 
NEIL stares, polite, as WIN whisks her away; turning, as he is addressed by someone else coming his way. 
EXT.  THE CLUB - NIGHT 
as a BLACK PORSCHE PULLS UP, its dark-tinted window rolling down TO REVEAL JOEY VENZA.  The MANAGER of the club comes over to him, with a clipboard list of only the invitees. 
MANAGER (a dilemma) I'm sorry, Mr. Venza... 
VENZA jams the ACCELERATOR to the FLOOR, the CAR burning rubber like a DRAGSTER as PEOPLE SQUEAL and JUMP OUT of the way; the CAR fish-tailing away, screeching AROUND the CORNER. 
INT.  CLUB - NIGHT 
WIN and CLAIRE.  The music, noise, other conversations can still be heard as they walk through the club. 
He smiles, mid-conversation; there's a real affection here. 
WIN Skiddy and Kit?  I haven't seen them since that shitty pasta dinner on the cape. 
CLAIRE They've got two monsters now.  Both boys. 
WIN And so what's with Steinhart?  Is it serious? 
CLAIRE You didn't like him? 
WIN Looks a little constipated to me. 
CLAIRE (needling him) It's called "solid"... Nice to find someone you can count on, Win. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  BASEMENT - REAR - ENTRANCE - NIGHT 
VENZA entering, a rush, NOISE and ACTIVITY from the alley outside; the throbbing new MUSIC overhead. 
JOEY VENZA 
Immaculate as always, in a conservatively-cut European pinstripe, VENZA strides tautly into the shabby corridors. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  MEZZANINE - MAIN BAR - NIGHT 
WIN shows CLAIRE the main dance floor below, sound-filled and crowded, private and paying GUESTS mixing, indistinguishable now.  He raises his voice to be heard. 
The elevator arrives.  The doors open.  CLAIRE steps out into the shadowed area of stacked rows. 
INT.  RESTAURANT - WIN AND VENZA 
VENZA (stares, wildly) Two years ago you were begging me for the money.  Nobody would've touched you... 
WIN You're making an eighty percent return.  Which is what you wanted. 
WIN turn away from VENZA.  VENZA grabs his arm violently. 
VENZA Don't turn away when I'm talking to you. 
WIN (beat with deliberation) Grease and water still don't mix, Joey. 
VENZA 
slashes one of the canvases (A Rosenquist) with the case cutter... Then another... 
ANGLE - WIN 
WIN (stunned) Jesus Christ... are you crazy? 
ANGLE 
Venza slashes another. 
WIN Joey! 
VENZA 
turns, slashing WIN. 
WIN 
gasps.  Blood begins to seep from his wound. 
ANGLE - CLAIRE 
hearing, emerges into the light, smiling, thinking WIN'S saying something she's supposed to respond to. 
VENZA 
slashing WIN again, losing all control. 
WIN (staggering back) Jesus...! 
CLAIRE ROUNDS THE CORNER 
Seeing WIN, she stops. 
ANGLE 
VENZA continues to attack him, stabbing WIN to the floor. 
CLAIRE 
screams, unable to imagine or believe it. 
VENZA 
looks up, hearing her. 
WIN sprawls, a lifeless, bloodied mass at VENZA'S feet. VENZA stares, returning CLAIRE'S stare, trying to concentrate, to focus and pull himself back together.  He puts down the cutter, taking a step toward her. 
CLAIRE 
steps back, turning and moving back toward the elevator, running. 
VENZA 
quickens his step, after her. 
ANGLE ON THE ELEVATOR 
as she REACHES IT and HURTLES inward, HITTING all the BUTTONS, the doors beginning to RUMBLE CLOSED.  But VENZA is there, THRUSTING HIS HAND INSIDE to stop them.  The doors CLOSE on his fingers.  He cries out, pulling his fingers free.  He slams his fist against the doors as they close shut, POUNDS the button again. 
ANGLE INSIDE - CLAIRE 
But CLAIRE grabs the POWER SWITCH, pulling it -- the elevator goes dead, the overhead lights go out -- and somewhere, in the shaft above, an ALARM BELL begins to RING. 
Relentlessly, VENZA pounds on the other side of the door. 
CLOSE ON CLAIRE 
NEIL Don't tell me he's "busy".  I asked for an ambulance for this woman and... 
MIKE Is she injured? 
CLAIRE (softly) No. 
MIKE gets his first view of her as she TURNS her head into the light.  It is an almost storybook vision of beauty that emerges from the darkness around her; her vulnerability penetrates to the very core. 
NEIL (to Claire) You're not going to talk to anyone without a lawyer. 
MIKE She's not a suspect, sir, she's a witness.  Could I ask you to step outside, please. 
NEIL No, I will not step outside. 
MIKE Sir, I am just trying to do my job, it's standard procedure to question the witness alone.  Help me out here, could you please leave. 
NEIL (icily) I don't really see what that has to do with... 
CLAIRE (deadened; to Neil) Neil, do what he says. 
ANGLE ON MIKE AND NEIL:  at a standoff. 
CLAIRE (quietly) Please. 
MIKE OPENS THE DOOR for NEIL.  NEIL reluctantly swallows it. 
NEIL I'll be right outside. 
NEIL grudgingly leaves.  MIKE quietly closes the door. 
ANGLE CHANGE:  CLAIRE and MIKE alone.  He sits down.  A beat. 
MIKE Can I get you a cup of coffee or something? 
Her plaintive eyes turning to meet his. 
CLAIRE (lost) I've never seen anyone killed before. 
MIKE It's okay... I've never been a detective before either... 
She lifts her gaze quizzically, catching his smile.  She returns it in spite of herself, disarmed by his frankness, and curiously reassured. 
MIKE We'll go slow.  Okay?  We'll get through it together. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  DOWNTOWN HEADQUARTERS - DAY 
PHONES RINGING, TYPEWRITERS TYPING, BODIES moving at cross-current -- CAMERA FINDING LIEUTENANT GARBER, hustling through the bullpen, MIKE FOLLOWING, toward his office. 
GARBER I don't know how you did it, but whatever it was, keep doing it. 
MIKE (puzzled) I just sat and listened. 
GARBER Safe and secure is how we want her. Until she I.D.'s Venza. 
T.J. has joined them. 
GARBER Venza's either going to skip or try to get to her and Venza likes it here.  I want her ass covered, 24 hour protection, but I don't want her to know there is any real danger. 
T.J. I don't like what I'm hearing... 
MIKE (to Garber) I don't understand.  If there's any danger, why not just level with her... 
GARBER turns back to MIKE 
GARBER (with mock tolerance) T.J. your friend's a little dense. When she realizes there's a killer tryin' to shut her up, she'll be on the next plane for Tahiti... somehow I think my way is better. 
He MOVES ON, leaving them not very happy. 
MIKE Chief? 
GARBER turns back. 
MIKE Why not Patrol?  They'd do just as good a job. 
GARBER When I want your advise, Keegan, I'll make an appointment. 
GARBER MOVES ON OUT.  MIKE and T.J. left alone. 
MIKE (disappointed) Shit!  A Nursemaid!  My first detail, and I'm a fuckin' slug! (turning to T.J.) I got a 'choice' at all. 
T.J. Do it, or look for another profession.  That's a choice I guess. 
EXT.  FIFTH AVENUE APARTMENT BUILDINGS - EARLY EVENING 
Out front, the DOORMAN opens the door for the building's children returning from music lessons. 
Across the street in Central Park, handsome, elderly tenants stroll in the company of their nurse:  a nanny pushes a pram, taking advantage of the last light.  This is one of New York's most exclusive co-ops.  Distilled civilization and quiet wealth.  A world away from Queens or anything else.  MIKE arrives on foot. 
INT./ EXT.  LOBBY - EVENING 
A notice behind the locked front door informs:  "ALL VISITORS MUST BE ANNOUNCED".  MIKE displays his shield to the DOORMAN through the glass.  The DOORMAN opens, taking the time to inspect his credentials before returning them, then STEPS ASIDE, allowing ENTRY. 
INT.  ELEVATOR - SAME 
MIKE rides up in silence, examining the ornate walls. 
INT.  VESTIBULE - CLAIRE'S APARTMENT - SAME 
The elevator delivers him.  MIKE finds himself in a wall- papered trompe l'oeil foyer.  Nothing to get his bearings. 
The front door clicks open, startling him.  MARY, the cleaning lady, an older, capable woman in functional civilian clothes, greets him matter-of-factly, taking him in. 
INT.  CLAIRE'S LIVING ROOM - SAME 
Marble-floored and high-ceilinged, absolutely palatial; MIKE'S EYES registering amazement as he's led inward. 
Floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking Central Park, where the VOICES are REVEALED belonging to GARBER, T.J., CLAIRE, and CLAIRE'S boyfriend, NEIL -- who's trying his best to be "in charge". 
GARBER (approaching Mike) You remember Detective Keegan? 
NEIL (expressionless) I do. 
The doorbell RINGS AGAIN:  MARY goes to answer it as MIKE mumbles his greetings to all -- noticing that CLAIRE, reclining on a couch, seems extremely put out -- or is it "disinterested"? 
NEIL I want to make sure that everyone respects the privacy of Miss Gregory's household.  You're limited to the outer vestibule, so you can watch the elevator, the kitchen, so you can get something to eat, and the washroom. 
T.J. (under his breath to Mike) So you can take a shit. 
The THIRD DETECTIVE enters, being led by MARY.  It's KOONTZ, a package of razz and sarcasm, somebody you definitely don't take home to mother. 
MIKE (reacting; to T.J.) Not Koontz. 
T.J. Be happy.  He's good at this. 
GARBER (to Neil) We'd like to, just once, get a look at the entire layout, so we can evaluate security. 
CLAIRE This really isn't necessary.  The security in this building is about the best in the city. 
GARBER (ever the diplomat) I'm sure you're right, Miss Gregory, but I'd consider it a favor if you'd let us look around. 
CLAIRE Be my guest. 
GARBER (to his troops) Guys. 
ANGLE - HALLWAY 
as GARBER withdraws; MIKE, T.J., KOONTZ to start their check. 
MIKE (to Garber) What about when she goes out? 
GARBER Discourage it.  But stay with her if you can't.  Call it in first so we can have a car on tail.  She's agreed to travel only with her own driver and limousine... okay, let's check it out. 
They split up. 
ANGLE - MIKE 
following orders, continues down the hall.  He moves to a door that he ATTEMPTS TO OPEN -- discovering it's not real.  It's a TROMPE L'OEIL.  He turns around to find he's not alone in the long hall.  NEIL stands just outside the living room, watching him. 
MIKE (re: the "door") Pretty good. 
ANGLE - NEIL 
turns, returning to CLAIRE in the LIVING ROOM. 
NEIL Why an I reminded of the Three Stooges? 
CUT TO: 
INT.  CLAIRE'S LIBRARY - MOMENTS LATER 
KOONTZ checking the windows and terrace. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  KITCHEN - SAME 
RETURN:  MIKE DODGES back quickly, through the living and dining rooms until he's in the kitchen. 
INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT 
Spotting the microwave, MIKE QUICKLY TOSSES in an English muffin -- peering at the dials, as he switches it on. 
But he hasn't escaped being a trespasser to what's going on in the far room.  He can still HEAR THEM, though HE WHISTLES, trying not to. 
The English muffin BURSTS INTO FLAMES, MIKE desperately pulling it out, tossing it into the sink, feverishly fanning the air. 
ANOTHER ANGLE ON MIKE:  becoming aware that HE'S NOT ALONE.  He TURNS SUDDENLY to see MARY, the housekeeper, not ten feet from him, in the laundry room, coat on, fluffing her collar, ready to go home. 
MIKE (chagrined) I like 'em toasty. 
ANGLE ON MARY:  staring at him, amused. 
MARY Good night, Mr. Keegan. 
She moves through the kitchen and EXITS. 
INT.  VESTIBULE - LATER - NIGHT 
NEIL, with his briefcase, finally leaving.  He crosses from the hallway. 
The TWO EYE EACH OTHER:  MIKE attempting a cordial smile. 
NEIL You're here 'til what time? 
MIKE I'm relieved at 4:00 A.M. 
NEIL noticing the Renoir. 
NEIL When you're through with it, put it back, please, exactly where you found it, and don't use the library again.  I have to leave town for a few days.  Let's do everything we can to make this less of a trial for her, shall we? 
MIKE NODS.  But when NEIL leaves, he makes a mock "military salute"; a click of the heels. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  CLAIRE'S VESTIBULE - LATER 
2:45 A.M. (the clock ON THE WALL); pindrop silence; MIKE alone. 
CLOSE ON MIKE:  thoughtful, leafing through the Renoir. Like a man making the most of solitary confinement -- becoming aware of a NOISE.  Though hard to make out in this windowless capsule, it is DISTANT THUNDER.  It stirs life in him and his eyes wander reflexively upward, studying the ceiling -- then the doors of the apartment, left slightly ajar. 
ANGLE INSIDE THE APARTMENT:  CAMERA FOLLOWING MIKE as he wanders inward, becoming aware of light coming from a drawing room.  HE MOVES TOWARD, STOPPING. 
ANGLE FROM HIS POV:  CLAIRE, dimly illuminated by the light of a desk lamp that throws a gentle glow around her -- seated, still as statuary, gazing out into the rain. 
CLOSE ON MIKE:  watching her. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT.  SUBWAY - ON THE MOVE - LATER 
The uncivilized hour indicated by the TOTALLY EMPTY SUBWAY, MIKE a lone figure, somewhat numbed, his eyes set into distant space -- as the SUBWAY reaches its DESTINATION, the blurry platform signs decelerating until we can make out the word "QUEENS". 
EXT.  MIKE'S HOUSE - QUEENS 
The neighborhood still asleep in the predawn hour; MIKE picks up the newspaper... glancing at it, he opens it, sees an article and photograph of CLAIRE on the second page.  He heads inwards... 
CUT TO: 
INT.  MIKE'S BEDROOM - DAY 
Afternoon sunlight SPILLING IN as MIKE AWAKENS to the SOUND of a CAR MOTOR, faltering, then "chug-chugging" to another start, gasping, then revving.  Someone's working on MIKE'S car.  He looks at his alarm clock; it's 4:00 in the afternoon. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  MIKE'S BACKYARD - DAY 
ELLIE and TOMMY visible only as fragments as they work on MIKE'S car.  ELLIE IS SEEN as a rear-end in blue jeans, the rest of her inside the hood; she calls to TOMMY to "try it again".  It looks like no one's behind the wheel; but the very top of his head CAN BE SEEN as he strains to reach the accelerator. 
ANGLE ON MIKE:  appearing at the door, in a freshly pressed suit, a steaming cup of coffee in hand.  He walks across the lawn towards them. 
MIKE Hey!  What the hell're you doin' to my car? 
ELLIE emerges from underneath the hood, flushed. 
ELLIE Changing the sparks.  They showed it on TV.  What d'you think? 
MIKE I think television's a dangerous thing. 
ELLIE It's twenty bucks in the bank. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  DOWNTOWN HEADQUARTERS - GARBER'S OFFICE 
GARBER is on the other end of the line. 
GARBER Oh, Jesus, what a fucking lunatic. Fucking shopping. (he thinks) I don't see that we have much choice.  Jesus Christ.  Tell her she's a fucking lunatic. 
GARBER slams down the phone. 
INT.  CLAIRE'S LIMO - NIGHT 
MIKE sets down the phone. 
CLAIRE What did he say? 
MIKE He thinks you're being a little careless.  He made the point several times. 
MIKE sets down the phone.  They settle back; trying to feel "comfortable" in one another's presence.  It's plenty awkward. 
CLAIRE You live in Manhattan? 
MIKE Queens... You know Queens? 
CLAIRE My father founded a music school there.  The Milton Gregory School. 
He politely tries to place it, with no idea. 
CLAIRE I'm supposed to speak at their tenth anniversary. 
MIKE Nice.  Maybe you'll stop by... have an aperitif... 
It evokes a slight smile but nothing more. 
MIKE Maybe not. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  5TH AVENUE SHOP - NIGHT 
The limo pulling up, MIKE hopping expertly out before it stops moving. 
It's parked in a red zone, with tow-away signs everywhere; a PATROLMAN notices from the curb. 
MIKE (to the driver) Don't move it. 
He flashes his shield at the PATROLMAN, takes a firm grip on CLAIRE'S elbow, guiding her in. 
ANGLE - AT THE ENTRANCE DOORS 
MIKE stiff-arms the revolving door, stopping outgoing shoppers to clear the way for CLAIRE; hops over to the fixed door, opening it quickly for her, hustling her effortlessly in, zip. 
ANGLE:  CLAIRE, taken by it, but not displeased. 
INT.  FIFTH AVENUE SHOP - NIGHT 
They cross toward the up escalator; she knows where she's going. 
PERFUME LADY Hello, Miss Gregory. 
CLAIRE steps onto the ESCALATOR; MIKE on alert, scrutinizing the crowd.  He gets on right behind.  They ascend. 
At the top LANDING, A DARK-SUITED MAN VEERS RIGHT INTO HER.  CLAIRE flinches.  MIKE MOVES PAST HER to the front, quickly handling the guy.  The MAN jumps back. 
DARK-SUITED MAN I'm sorry... I thought this was down... 
ANGLE ON MIKE; SHAKEN.  CLAIRE giving him a long unsteady look, too. 
CLAIRE Are you nervous? 
MIKE No, Ma'am. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  SHOP - GIFT COUNTER - NIGHT 
MIKE keeping close watch as CLAIRE approves her purchase: a silver frame, containing an inscribed photo of CLAIRE and an elegant older woman. 
CLAIRE Would you wrap it for me, I'll be back in a moment. 
CLAIRE walks past MIKE. 
CLAIRE Could you come with me please. 
CLAIRE I wouldn't have missed it, Tony. 
ANTONIA You look so beautiful... 
ANTONIA looks up to see MIKE. 
CLAIRE This is Mike Keegan, the policeman assigned to protect me.  Antonia Bolt... 
She looks up to SEE MIKE:  it directs others to do the same. 
MARGE (change of tone) Hello. 
CLAIRE (introducing) Marge Woodwin, Antonia Bolt, this is Mike Keegan... 
MIKE (ultra respectful) Hello... (a deferential nod to Antonia) ... Ma'am. 
ANTONIA (liking him; to Claire) He's got nice eyes.  Very gentle. (re: Mike's embarrassed reaction) And he blushes.  I like that.  Take good care of her. 
INT.  THE RECEPTION - LATER - NIGHT 
CLAIRE in the thick of things -- a BAND PLAYING NOW -- occasionally glancing at MIKE -- who stands against a wall, ever watchful... 
CLOSE ON MIKE: TURNING to see a VERY PRETTY YOUNG THING come up to him; just "oozing" seduction. 
PRETTY YOUNG THING I hear you're a policeman. 
MIKE nods; eyes fixed on CLAIRE. 
MIKE Uh, yeah.  I'm a policeman. 
PRETTY YOUNG THING Ever shot anyone? 
MIKE Yes. 
PRETTY YOUNG THING Does it make you... hard? 
MIKE ... Hard? 
PRETTY YOUNG THING Erect.  You know, a "boner?"  I'd heard that it gives you a boner, to shoot a man. 
MIKE'S eyes register abject dumbfoundment. 
MIKE Would you excuse me, please? 
HE PUSHES TOWARD CLAIRE, catching her eye. 
MIKE Would you consider leaving here pretty soon? 
CLAIRE relaxed, clearly having a good time. 
CLAIRE People think I'm stepping out on Neil.  We're causing quite a scandal. 
MIKE (confidential) Hey!  There are crazy people here. 
CLAIRE Let's get a drink. 
MIKE Ah... I shouldn't... on duty. 
She plows toward the crowded bar, just inside the ballroom entrance, MIKE following. 
CLAIRE I'll have a spritzer, order something soft for yourself... I must go for a pee. 
MIKE I'll come with you. 
CLAIRE I think I can probably do that on my own. 
CLOSE ON MIKE:  Not amused.  CLAIRE heads to the ladies' room across from the bar.  MIKE watches her enter.  Turns back to the bar, which is very busy and confused. 
MIKE (irritated) Gimme a spritzer, and a... vodka martini. 
MIKE seeing the Pretty Young Thing. 
MIKE Make it a double. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  LADIES' ROOM - SAME - NIGHT 
as a pair of WOMEN finish their "touch-up" and head out, making way for CLAIRE to step up to the mirror to assess herself.  The room momentarily empties.  Putting her purse down she moves to a stall and enters. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  BAR COUNTER - NIGHT 
MIKE and T.J. with GARBER, MIKE being CONGRATULATED by COPS who pass.  But GARBER doesn't look happy. 
MIKE (protesting) But I got him!  He's in jail! Wasn't that the point...?! 
GARBER You apprehended him after he gave himself up -- 
MIKE It wasn't a bad bust.  He gave himself up because he knew I was gonna nab him. 
GARBER Anyone who turns himself in makes a good case for bail. 
MIKE Even Joey Venza?! 
GARBER He's got a good lawyer, and he made a smart move.  We've got a scared witness and a suspect who proved "good will" by turning himself in. 
MIKE (protesting) What about when she identifies him?! 
GARBER If she identifies him. (turns, unloading on him) Where the fuck were you anyway, cowboy!  Venza was meat.  He walked right past you, and now we're the ones playing catch-up!  You better hope she identifies him. 
GARBER turns on his heel, ENTERING HIS OFFICE; leaving MIKE looking at T.J.  Dismayed. 
T.J. Wasn't your fault. 
MIKE (exasperated) It was my fault, T.J.  Fuck! 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  TRACT HOME - BROOKLYN HEIGHTS - AFTERNOON 
A tree-lined neighborhood.  The house has a FOR SALE sign in front; MIKE is standing in front of a cab, he's dressed for work -- he looks around.  The cab pulls out, he heads for the front door. 
INT.  TRACT HOME - AFTERNOON 
MIKE enters the house.  It's nothing special.  ELLIE is in another room.  She joins MIKE. 
ELLIE The real estate lady left, she couldn't wait anymore.  What took you? 
MIKE (upset) Oh, some shit. 
ELLIE What shit, honey? 
MIKE You don't want to hear about it. 
ELLIE begins to show him the place. 
ELLIE ... Look at the fireplace.  You don't get workmanship like that anymore. 
ANGLE ON MIKE:  preoccupied. 
ELLIE Ninety-seven five.  What do you think? 
He nods, trying hard to "be there," but ELLIE isn't fooled; she assesses him with concern. 
ELLIE Honey.  You got him. 
MIKE I don't know that Ellie.  He might get out.  Garber's not bein' straight with the witness, she could be in deep shit if she identifies him, and it's my job to convince her she won't be. 
ELLIE (the voice of sanity) She's got to identify him. 
MIKE Why? 
ELLIE (taken aback) Because the the only way to stop crime is to identify criminals.  I can't believe you're talking this way Mister Detective -- I think she's got a lot of guts. 
MIKE I think -- she's crazy. 
ELLIE I'd identify him. 
MIKE I might stop you. 
A beat. 
ELLIE Oh I can see you've had a bad day. We'll see the house another time, okay? 
MIKE (trying to recover) No!  No!  I'm sorry.  Ninety-seven five right? 
ELLIE Where'd you get the tie? 
He's wearing the tie CLAIRE bought him. 
MIKE (distracted) Bought it. 
ELLIE It's not your taste. 
MIKE What did she say the down payment was? 
MIKE (amazed) Yeah, what a woman. 
He marks it in his CROSSWORDS:  she moves closer,leaning over his shoulder to see. 
CLAIRE Didn't do very well, did you? 
MIKE (a laugh) Nope... never finished one yet.  I hate these things. 
CLAIRE You were reading my Renoir. 
MIKE How did you know? 
CLAIRE You put it back in the wrong place... Do you like Renoir? 
MIKE (thoughtful) They're kind of fuzzy. 
CLAIRE You know why they're like that...? He was myopic... going blind. 
MIKE No kidding. 
In the SILENCE that follows, their eyes on each other, appraising. 
CLAIRE So, this could be your last night, huh? 
MIKE Could be, I guess. 
CLAIRE (a thought) Want to go out for a drink? (re: his surprised expression) I mean, we're both sitting here, and Joey Venza's in jail... 
MIKE (a beat) Yeah, I like that!  Where you go, I follow. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  FIFTH AVENUE - NIGHT 
CLAIRE and MIKE walking; her arm looped in his -- the BLACK-AND-WHITE keeping pace alongside them -- their conversation animated, clearly enjoying one another's company. 
CLAIRE (laughing) You mean to tell me, a mugger would stay away from someone because they walked a certain way? 
MIKE Absolutely.  Look at this. 
He demonstrates a peculiar walk; arms and legs moving in ridiculous awkwardness. 
CLAIRE That's the dumbest walk I ever saw! 
MIKE (indignant) No, no seriously!  There's a study done on this, you walk this way, the muggers are gonna single you out. 
CLAIRE And die laughing, because you're walking so stupid! 
MIKE (mock anger) Hey.  This is my business.  Do I tell you your business. 
CLAIRE Okay.  Let's just see if a mugger gets me. 
She takes off down the street; walking stupidly, worse than he did -- he's LAUGHING as he WATCHES HER GO. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  PATROL CAR - NIGHT 
The COPS following exchange dubious glances, getting a glimpse of the strangeness. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT.  PIANO BAR - NIGHT 
CAMERA FINDING CLAIRE and MIKE, at a small table, in darkness, a piano bar playing in the background.  The song being sung is "SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME." 
MIKE ... It was like... the minute I saw her... I knew.  She looked so damn adorable in a cop's uniform... puttin' on a big, tough act... 
CLAIRE So it was "love". 
MIKE Yeah.  It was. 
CLAIRE And "is"...? 
He hesitates; but nods. 
MIKE (confirming it) Yeah. 
CLAIRE That's nice.  And you live in Queens?  With a child, and a dog...? 
MIKE No dog. 
CLAIRE I saw you with a dog, in my mind. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  CORRIDOR - DAY 
GARBER and MIKE on the carpet. 
GARBER (steamed) Don't tell me it was "no big deal," it was out of line, it makes you look like an asshole, and it makes me look like an asshole.  She's coming in, in a few minutes to I.D. Venza.  If Steinhart's with her, I want you to apologize. (in motion) Let's get this over with... 
In the room next to the corridor, KOONTZ interrupts the shift already there, entering. 
KOONTZ Okay, we're gonna have a line-up here... 
The OTHER COPS grab their things and scatter, not wanting to get involved in another cop's headache. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  FARTHER DOWN THE CORRIDOR - SAME - DAY 
CLAIRE approaching with NEIL, with T.J. on guard-duty. 
GARBER Good morning, Miss Gregory. 
MIKE AND CLAIRE catch each other's eyes.  He sees how nervous she is. 
CLAIRE It was my fault not Detective Keegan's, I'm sorry for all the fuss. 
NEIL catches MIKE'S glance at her; reassures himself with a glance at CLAIRE, straightens, still steamed from last night. 
GARBER picks up on it, not liking the tension, especially not now; his eyes throw daggers at MIKE. 
GARBER (to Claire) You all ready? 
NEIL (playing the protector role) Will this take long? 
GARBER We'll see. 
GARBER TURNS, getting them started. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  VIEWING ROOM - SAME - DAY 
They crowd in; another MAN already standing there -- VENZA'S PARK AVENUE LAWYER.  A one-way window looks into the brightness of the line-up (squad) room that's emptied now and undergoing preparation by KOONTZ. 
GARBER to CLAIRE, a professional reassurance. 
GARBER They can't hear you, they can't see you... (introducing pro forma) Mr. Venza's attorney, Mr. Neuman; arresting officer Keegan... (to Claire) Good luck. 
With that, GARBER leads NEIL out.  NEIL manages a final concerned stare at CLAIRE before he goes.  The DOOR CLOSES.  MIKE, CLAIRE, and an unruffled MR. NEUMAN, THE LAWYER, are left alone in the cramped space. 
INT.  LINE-UP ROOM - SAME - DAY 
KOONTZ beckons VENZA and the OTHER FOUR LINE-UP PARTICIPANTS IN. 
KOONTZ Okay, take a seat... you, put a couple phone books under your rear... 
VENZA enters confidently, with the others.  He's number three.  He takes his place, staring unconcernedly past the bright lights toward the direction of the mirrored window, as if he could see through it, into CLAIRE'S EYES. 
INT.  VIEWING ROOM - SAME - DAY 
CLAIRE, staring expressionless, her eyes etched with fear. MIKE aware of that fear.  VENZA'S LAWYER waiting patiently, casually. 
INT.  LINE-UP ROOM - DAY 
VENZA and the OTHERS WAITING, now STANDING ON DISPLAY. 
KOONTZ (V.O.) (OVER SPEAKER) Will everyone except number three please take one step back? 
VENZA'S JAW TIGHTENS, a flicker, before catching himself and controlling the reaction.  Realizing.  She's making positive identification. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  SUBWAY - EVENING 
MIKE, empty-eyed.  On his way HOME. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  MIKE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
ELLIE dressed for sleep, in a DISNEYWORLD T-SHIRT, pauses to glance with worried eyes -- toward the living room where WE HEAR the SOUND of a TV. 
ANGLE ON MIKE:  on a couch, beer in hand -- mindlessly watching. 
SILENCE. 
MIKE (to Ellie, with finality) I'm due on at seven. 
He dumps the rest of the lunch preparations in the sink, exiting. 
ANGLE on TOMMY and ELLIE looking distraught. 
TOMMY (dismally) We're not going to the game, are we Mom? 
ELLIE (pulling herself together) Sure we are, let's go! 
CUT TO: 
INT.  CLAIRE'S KITCHEN - EVENING 
MUSIC TURNED UP FULL. 
CLAIRE spills red wine over the counter, uncorking the bottle.  She leaves the stain, grabbing the bottle and a wine glass, taking them with her, in emotional extremis. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  CLAIRE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - EVENING 
ANGLE on MIKE:  as he rounds a corner ALMOST BUMPING INTO the JOGGER from CLAIRE'S BUILDING; MIKE hurries, sidestepping him, HEADING toward the ENTRANCE. 
ANGLE FROM HIS POV:  CLAIRE'S FRONT ENTRANCE; extra SECURITY -- A SQUAD CAR PARKED IN FRONT now. 
ANGLE ON MIKE:  SPRINTING INWARD. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  CLAIRE'S VESTIBULE - SAME - NIGHT 
The ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN and MIKE steps out, breathless, confronting KOONTZ.  The MUSIC CONTINUES TO BLAST from behind the closed apartment doors. 
KOONTZ grabbing his stuff, massive understatement. 
KOONTZ She's a little upset.  You're going to have to piss in a bottle. 
He holds up a beer bottle; half-filled with urine. 
KOONTZ (packs it under his arm) Sorry, I don't have any extras. Have a nice night. 
HE WILLINGLY LEAVE, and MIKE WAITS but a split second, before going to the doors.  They are closed.  MUSIC blares from within.  No other response. 
INT.  CLAIRE'S LIVING ROOM - SAME - NIGHT 
Distraught, CLAIRE tries to bring herself back from the brink, placing the wine bottle rack down after she's poured. 
MIKE (O.S.) Claire? 
CLAIRE (frightened) What do you want? 
MIKE (O.S.) Open the door, will you? 
CLAIRE I can't open it. 
MIKE (O.S.) It's just me.  I want to talk to you.  Let me in... 
The lock turns and it opens, but just a crack, enough to see that she's hysterical, her eyes reddened from crying. 
CLAIRE You put me life in danger. 
MIKE No, you'll be safe.  We're gonna pick him up again... 
CLAIRE And then what?  I'll never be safe. I'll have to leave the country!  You can't protect me, and you can't keep him in jail!  And you knew that all the goddamn time! 
Near bursting, she SLAMS THE DOOR, leaving MIKE STUNNED: Inside, the MUSIC is TURNED UP AGAIN to THUNDEROUS PROPORTIONS. 
Clenching his fists, MIKE PACES in frustration, then SLAMS his fist against the wall -- NOTICING the door has failed to FULLY SHUT. 
HE PUSHES IT OPEN, ENTERING THE APARTMENT, CAMERA FOLLOWING HIM as he looks for her.  The MUSIC, bounding off the high ceilings and marble floors, is thunderous. 
INT.  CLAIRE'S HALL - NIGHT 
MIKE (searching for her) Claire...? 
He moves HURRIEDLY DOWN THE HALL to her BEDROOM, entering, without warning, to SEE HER REFLECTION in the MIRROR as she PULLS ON SOME CLOTHES. 
MIKE What are you doing? 
The dress on, she SWEEPS past him, heading toward the doors. 
CLAIRE He's okay? 
T.J. spots, over his shoulder, the table, set for two. 
T.J. Yeah, just... bad gut.  Y'know. 
CLAIRE Oh. 
Nothing left to say; she hides her disappointment with a nod. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  CITY STREET - FIFTH AVENUE - NIGHT 
Active with nightlife; CAMERA PANNING to a lone figure walking in the night.  It's MIKE; his collar turned up against the cold, his face grim and pensive.  He passes an art gallery and PAUSES to gaze in, his eyes refocusing on his own reflection staring back at him. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  CLAIRE'S APARTMENT - SAME - NIGHT 
CLAIRE immobile, on a window seat in her LIVING ROOM, the CLASSICAL MUSIC still playing softly in the background, her eyes empty as she gazes out into the park. 
THE MUSIC CONTINUES OVER: 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT 
Outside and far below, the GLOW from the tip of a CIGARETTE REDDENS the darkness with an inhalation. 
VENZA:  He stands, impervious to the cold, looking up at the windows of CLAIRE'S apartment. 
ANGLE UP TO CLAIRE:  SILHOUETTED in the distant window. 
VENZA:  finishes his butt, flicks it, satisfied, getting into HIS CAR curbside and driving away. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  CLAIRE'S VESTIBULE - NIGHT 
T.J., DOZING as the ELEVATOR INDICATOR HEADS UPWARD -- finally reaching our FLOOR. 
The DOORS OPEN, STARTLING T.J.  He stares at MIKE with DISMAY.  MUSIC IS HEARD from just inside. 
T.J. (fatigued) Tell me I'm dreamin'. 
MIKE I just gotta talk to her, T.J. 
MIKE ENTERS, closing the doors behind him. 
INT.  CLAIRE'S APARTMENT - SAME - NIGHT 
Silent, save for CLASSICAL MUSIC -- as MIKE quietly enters. 
He pauses a moment, his eyes filled with unhappiness, then MOVES in the direction of the MUSIC -- SPOTTING CLAIRE, immobile since we last saw her, still gazing out the window. 
CLOSE ON MIKE:  as always, AFFECTED BY HER. 
She becomes aware of his presence and slowly TURNS.  For a long moment, neither seems willing to move -- or speak. Finally, he does. 
MIKE T.J. agreed to take my shift.  He knows about us. 
She absorbs it, without response. 
MIKE (a beat; with difficulty) So does Ellie. 
She nods.  Thoughtfully.  As though willing to deal with it intellectually, but avoiding any encounter with her emotions. 
CLAIRE You told her? 
MIKE Not exactly. 
CLAIRE What do you want to do? 
MIKE I don't know. 
Her eyes turn to his.  She moves toward him and sits. CLAIRE pulls him close to her.  A soft GERSHWIN TUNE plays.  She sees how drawn MIKE is. 
CLAIRE You're tired. (smiles, gently) Let me watch over you tonight... 
CUT TO: 
INT.  CLAIRE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
The KILLER enters the reflective maze. 
INT.  MASTER BATH - NIGHT 
MIKE moves silently, backtracking through the bedroom and bathroom toward the DOORS leading to the dressing room ahead. 
INT.  DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT 
The KILLER passes the door he wants, thinking it's just another mirror; finds himself in the totally MIRRORED ENVIRONMENT of the MAIN DRESSING AREA. 
On the other side of the door, MIKE HEARS HIM, tightening his grip on his gun and on the doorknob as he REACHES for it.  MIKE grasps it, turning and opening the door silently.  But the latch connects to the light, and the LIGHT GOES ON OVERHEAD of MIKE. 
The KILLER reacts quickly, gun drawn, on the turn.  But he faces SEVERAL REFLECTIONS OF MIKE in front of him -- and MIKE IS BEHIND HIM. 
MIKE LEVELS AIM AT HIM. 
MIKE Put it down! (beat) Think about it! 
The KILLER takes his chances, WHIRLING.  MIKE FIRES FIRST, NAILING HIM right through the HEAD.  The KILLER SPINS AGAIN, SLAMMING UP against the MIRRORS and falling DEAD to the floor. 
IN THE BEDROOM:  CLAIRE wakes. 
MIKE:  checking quickly on the dead assassin, flattens himself against the wall and scurries back through the bath the way back into the BEDROOM. 
MIKE (entering, to Claire) Get on the floor!  There may be more! 
CLAIRE does what he says. 
MIKE RACES into the CORRIDOR, hugging the wall; he PAUSES momentarily, then RACES down the HALL. 
ANGLE ON THE OPENED FRONT DOOR as he REACHES IT, seeing T.J.'S CHAIR empty. 
MIKE (desperate) T.J.! 
MIKE RUNS, frantically, into the living room, the bathroom, the den -- CAMERA FOLLOWING HIM into the KITCHEN. 
CLOSE ON HIS FACE:  twisting with GRIEF. 
ANGLE ON T.J. face down in a pool of blood, MIKE RACING TO HIM, rolling him over. 
MIKE (sobs) T.J...! 
MIKE moves by REFLEX, starting mouth-to-mouth.  But there is blood everywhere. 
MIKE desperate; pumping T.J.'S chest. 
MIKE Live, T.J.  Please...! 
CLAIRE appears behind him, to help. 
MIKE (to her) Get security on the phone! Emergency! 
She RUNS to the KITCHEN PHONE; it's dead, the WIRES CUT. 
She TURNS, HURRYING to the VESTIBULE and THE ELEVATOR, pulling the alarm, sagging in collapse.  The ALARM goes off within the shaft, THROUGHOUT the building. 
ANGLE ON MIKE:  shirtless and shoeless, on his knees in T.J.'S blood, desperately pumping his chest. 
MIKE (his voice cracking) Ambulance!  Ambulance!  He's got a heartbeat...! 
CUT TO: 
INT.  HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NEAR DAWN 
MIKE alone on a bench, his head in his hands:  a couple of COPS we recognize from the Precinct stand a distance away, at a coffee machine, talking softly as they glance at him. It is not yet dawn. 
FOOTSTEPS are HEARD coming TOWARD; MIKE looks up to see GARBER APPROACHING, his expression appropriate to the occasion.  GARBER reaches him; they exchange a long look, MIKE'S eyes etched with anguish. 
MIKE (softly) They're operating on him.  He's still alive. 
GARBER (grim) I heard. 
A long pause, as he looks at MIKE. 
GARBER I heard a lot... Anything you want to deny, Mike? 
MIKE (almost inaudibly) It should've been me... 
GARBER:  aware of his own dilemma. 
GARBER Then it would've been her, too. (beat) I don't know... but I gotta protect the Precinct, too.  You're on suspension, pending Disciplinary Hearings.  Don't hold your breath. And you're not to go near that woman until she's no longer under Police protection and this case is closed. 
ANGLE ON MIKE:  responding with a silent nod as GARBER stands looking down at him. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  SCOTTY'S KITCHEN - SAME - DAY 
MIKE on the telephone. 
MIKE You don't want to know. 
CLAIRE (V.O.) Oh, I do want to know.  I tried to reach you at the precinct. 
MIKE I've moved into Scotty's... Good news about T.J., though.  Looks like that tough son of a gun is gonna pull through. 
CLAIRE (V.O.) Oh God, that's great! 
MIKE (gently) Are you okay? 
CUT TO: 
CLAIRE - SAME 
CLAIRE (trying to brighten) Oh, I'm fine.  They've replaced you with quite an entourage.  It's a regular "marching band".  You should see me on the street, you'd think I was the First Lady -- 
She attempts a laugh, trying to keep it "light". 
CLAIRE I'm taking them all out to Queens, as a matter of fact, right in your neighborhood.  There's an event at my Father's school... an anniversary... I thought maybe you could come... 
MIKE (V.O.) Oh that thing in Queens. 
CLAIRE (faltering) I'm going away after that, the next morning. 
CUT TO: 
MIKE - SAME 
Impacted by it. 
MIKE Where? 
CLAIRE (V.O.) Pretty far.  I'm told not to say anything about it on the phone, in case it's tapped... they think it's best, safer, if I go away, at least till Venza's found. 
CLOSE ONE MIKE:  absorbing it. 
MIKE When can I see you? 
CUT TO: 
CLAIRE - SAME 
CLAIRE I don't know.  Garber's left orders here not to let you in the building. 
CUT TO: 
MIKE - SAME 
CLOSE ON MIKE:  beat. 
MIKE Oh yeah.  When is it?  This thing in Queens. 
CUT TO: 
CLAIRE - SAME 
CLAIRE Tomorrow night.  Can you come? 
MIKE (V.O.) (torn) I don't know.  It wouldn't be very smart. 
CLAIRE Listen, you're right.  Don't do it. I'll just... send you an address, okay? 
Fighting tears; not wanting him to know it. 
MIKE (V.O.) Claire... 
CLAIRE No really, it's okay, I've gotta go. I'm expecting some calls.  I'll be fine, really. 
MIKE (V.O.) I'll think about Wednesday. 
MIKE hangs up, torn. 
CUT TO: 
CLAIRE - SAME 
Hangs up. 
TOMMY (thoughtful) Mom, what's going to happen with you and Dad? 
ELLIE I don't know Tommy. 
A LONG BEAT as TOMMY thinks about this.  His attention switches to a passing McDONALD'S. 
TOMMY Hey, can we go to McDonald's? 
ELLIE Absolutely. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  MILTON GREGORY - BANQUET HALL - EVENING 
Overhead, chandeliers gleam.  A small orchestra comprised of STUDENTS of the school plays a variety of tunes. Mirrors reflect a profusion of flowers, carved gilt and candlelight. 
Gloved service PERSONNEL wait to be of service at the sides.  The room is quite large yet intimate.  The tables set perfectly.  GUESTS continue to move toward their places engaged in animated chatter. 
ANOTHER ANGLE:  CLAIRE moving through the crowd, PLAINCLOTHESMEN flanking her as anonymously as possible (KOONTZ among them), HER EYES anxious, scanning the crowd. 
SHE'S SPOTTED by the PRINCIPAL of the school (GIDDINGS), who APPROACHES, surprised to see her. 
GIDDINGS Hello, Claire.  How extraordinary that you came. 
CLAIRE It was something my father always liked me to do. 
GIDDINGS (apprehensive) You're planning to speak? 
CLAIRE Not if you don't want me to. 
GIDDINGS (a brief hesitation) Well, of course, we'd be... honored... 
CLAIRE (understands; gamely) Just putting in an appearance then. 
SHE GLANCES around, her "ESCORTS" mistaking it for anxiety, one of them taking her arm and escorting her in. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  THE BANQUET ROOM - LATER 
SPEECHES droning on -- CAMERA FINDING CLAIRE at a round dinner table, with OTHERS, who think they're engaging her in conversation; but her thoughts are elsewhere, her eyes continually glancing toward the doors -- both hoping and fearing. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT.  THE BANQUET ROOM - LATER 
The SPEECHES have long since ENDED, PEOPLE DANCING, slow dances to the live orchestra -- CAMERA PANNING to CLAIRE, sitting in silent isolation at the now sparsely populated table, having lost hope, feeling utterly alone.  Her chin is resting in her hand, her eyes fixed sadly on her wine glass.  PLAINCLOTHESMEN, situated around her, study her dispassionately. 
CLOSE ON HER FACE:  expressionless.  But it slowly gains animation, as she realizes the MUSIC has changed, made a segue to something new.  It's "SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME." 
SHE LOOKS UP -- to see MIKE; his approach from the bandstand indicating that the change of music was his doing. 
HER FACE breaks into the most enormous, and grateful, GRIN. 
CLOSE ON MIKE:  returning the smile as he COMES TOWARD. 
KOONTZ (as he passes) Don't do it, man.  I love ya, but you're out of your mind. 
Uncaring, MIKE MOVES TO CLAIRE. 
ANGLE ON BOTH:  gazing at each other. 
CLAIRE (overwhelmed) What a memory. 
MIKE Do you dance? 
CLAIRE Do you? 
MIKE Pretty bad. 
CLAIRE Let's do it. 
They TAKE to the FLOOR, she MOVING INTO HIS ARMS.  She puts her head on his shoulder, then draws back to look at him, studying his face with the hunger of a woman who knows it might be for the last time. 
MIKE They guys treatin' you all right? 
CLAIRE (too emotional to really talk) Yeah. 
MIKE I've been doing a lot of thinking. 
CLAIRE (a pause) I know. 
CLOSE ON HIM:  studying her saddened eyes. 
MIKE Venza. 
OTHER PLAINCLOTHESMEN are COMING. 
MIKE At my house...! 
KOONTZ (shouting to others) Call a cruiser! 
CLAIRE ... Mike. 
MIKE (to Claire) It's Venza.  He wants you.  You, for Ellie and Tommy. 
KOONTZ (to Claire) Let's go. (to others; urgent) We're takin' her home! (swinging into crisis mode) Move it!  Get the cars! 
MIKE (pleading) Koontz!  I need you guys! 
KOONTZ We'll call SWAT.  We'll get the locals. (re: another cops's radio) Throw it! 
MIKE (pleading) No, I need'm now! 
CLAIRE (to Koontz) Go with him! 
KOONTZ My job is to protect you! (into radio) This is Koontz -- 
MIKE (near hysteria) No One-Seventeen, they'll fuck it up!  He told me not to tell anybody, to bring Claire and come alone!  He won't wait, he knows I'm two minutes away!  Koontz, please! 
KOONTZ I can't do it, you know that... He's not gonna allow it anyway, Mike.  No way is he gonna let anybody walk out of that house alive, who can finger him. 
MIKE WHIRLS, heedlessly, running for the DOORS, CLAIRE RACING AFTER HIM. 
PLAINCLOTHESMAN #1 (calling after her) Hey...! 
CLAIRE Mike!  Don't go there...!  Then make them come with you! 
MIKE They can't, they're assigned to you!  I'd do the same thing! 
He RACES OUT THE DOOR:  she in PURSUIT. 
KOONTZ (re: Claire) Go get her. 
PLAINCLOTHESMAN #1 hurries out. 
KOONTZ (reconsidering) Fuck it, man.  Our brother needs us. Let's go. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  MILTON GREGORY SCHOOL - SAME MOMENT - NIGHT 
MIKE BOUNDING to his car, CLAIRE hot on his heels.  She JUMPS into the PASSENGER SEAT, pounding the DOOR LOCK SHUT. 
MIKE (into his car) Go!  Get outta here! 
PLAINCLOTHESMAN #1 REACHES HER, pulling on the DOOR. 
PLAINCLOTHESMAN #1 Hey! 
MIKE Get OUT! 
CLAIRE They're assigned to me, they'll have to go if I come with you! 
MIKE HESITATES. 
CLAIRE (screaming) I'm not getting out!  GO! 
MIKE hits the ACCELERATOR -- PEELING OUT, leaving PLAINCLOTHESMAN #1 stranded on the curb. 
KOONTZ (calling to him, emerging) Adams...!  C'mon, move it! 
ANGLE ON COPS:  RACING FOR THEIR CARS -- SCREECHING OUT. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  STREETS OF QUEENS - SAME - NIGHT 
MIKE'S CAR tearing down the STREET -- PURSUED by TWO MORE SQUAD CARS, one of them not knowing better, GIVING VOICE TO HIS SIREN! 
CUT TO: 
INT.  MIKE'S CAR - SAME - NIGHT 
MIKE'S terrified eyes glancing into the REARVIEW MIRROR. 
MIKE Turn off the siren...!
